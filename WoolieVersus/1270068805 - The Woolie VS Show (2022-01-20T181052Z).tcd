[0:56:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Are you Miles
[0:56:26] <Shockmaster182> I’m curious to see what they do with Pete gameplay wise in Spider-Man 2, because miles is basically just a better version of him rn
[0:56:29] <+vaderxyz1970> NOT JJJ FOREVER
[0:56:43] <%dds333a> @shockmaster182 Iron Spider

[0:57:04] <leith_aziz> All of a sudden, it hits me. Devil's Breath was basically covid

[0:57:11] <%baka_sugoi> BACKFLIP FeelsGoodMan
[0:57:12] <%Shad0wTag> @Shockmaster182 They'll have to emphaise on Peter's animation being having him be more acrobatic and creative and even more tech gadgets built into combos
[0:57:20] <Dante_Namikaze1> Miles has 6
[0:57:31] <@Menitta> I wanna see a Speedrun of Spiderman but no swinging.
[0:57:32] <%Kaito_Cam> @WoolieVersus there is also the loading transitions.
[0:57:38] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Suprised no one said this sooner
[0:57:41] <coreybom> @shockmaster182 Judging by the trailer for Spider-Man 2, it looks like he has his metal spider-arms as an extra combat ability.
[0:57:55] <%Shad0wTag> @coreybom Good call
[0:57:57] <%mr_sups> Apparently. The SSD on the PS5 made the subway transitions less necessary, and thus optional.
[0:58:19] <DSD24> @Menitta That'd be like a God Hand playthough with no dodging, that actually sounds pretty neat
[0:58:19] <leith_aziz> pickyIsee
[0:58:30] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag that's what i was referring to LUL
[0:58:30] <Djinnazz> @mr_sups well there's no loading times so.
[0:58:34] <+samuraiknack> @Shockmaster182 Venom, gadgets and his new arms
[0:58:34] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes
[0:58:40] <%kyh9> Why does she look so cringe
[0:58:47] <%Prevot> I'm looking forward to them making a small game like this starring Venom after the next game
[0:58:56] <%dds333a> @kyh9 she is LUL
[0:58:57] <coreybom> @shad0wtag Yeah, basically an always on version of it that he had in the main game, and most likely new gadgets for Kraven and Venom, and who ever else.
[0:58:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Boooo
[0:59:00] <leith_aziz> One "change"
[0:59:05] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a I didn't see your comment?

[0:59:24] <DSD24> Hoodie with cool mask on is the coolest look
[0:59:24] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag nah, I was just saying LUL
[0:59:47] <leith_aziz> @Prevot Ultimate Spiderman game with Venom doodOK
[0:59:48] <%dds333a> @mace210 what about the one on Crackle Kappa
[0:59:59] <leith_aziz> @mace210 I know about it
[1:00:18] <@Menitta> How many of these Peter challenges has been done
[1:00:19] <coreybom> @mace210 The one with the AMAZINGLY AWESOME banger of a theme.
[1:00:25] <leith_aziz> @diegobandzz pickyWave
[1:00:26] <%Shad0wTag> @mace210 Oh yeah, it was NOT good. It was Peter's weird counter earth furry adventures
[1:00:41] <superchunk121> These took me a while to perfect em
[1:00:42] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta Maybe half?
[1:00:49] <%dds333a> @samuraiknack I doubt we'll see him actually do symbiote shit

[1:01:50] <leith_aziz> pickySad
[1:02:08] <+mace210> @coreybom it was that, batman beyond and sherlock holmes in the 22nd century for me,  that superheroes in the future type beat
[1:02:38] <leith_aziz> @coreybom Batman Beyond. Awesome show  doodOK
[1:02:54] <coreybom> @mace210 Batman Beyond was the one that worked the best, helped that it had the same team being BTAS and STAS.
[1:02:54] <%dds333a> @mace210 are you counting that Looney tunes superhero show too LUL LUL
[1:03:09] <+samuraiknack> @ddss333a I think we will mainly get finishers with Symbiote shit
[1:03:31] <+samuraiknack> @leith_aziz I'm greedy
[1:03:39] <+mace210> @dds333a i vaguely remember that one wut was it called again
[1:03:53] <%dds333a> @samuraiknack mostly is Venom is playable, which i think he will be, but not necessarily as Pete
[1:04:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Open world characters be like: "I should get back to the main quest..."
[1:04:23] <%Shad0wTag> I really don't want Venom playable. I'm happy with Peter and Miles
[1:04:39] <%dds333a> @mace210 Loonatics Unleashed
[1:05:16] <+mace210> @dds333a YES that what it was called never watched saw previews for it tho LUL LUL LUL
[1:05:37] <leith_aziz> I actually would want Venom playable to contrast against Peter regularly like Ultimate Spiderman (the game) did. It was awesome. But with the way it's been setup, Miles matters more so its important he gets screentime
[1:05:37] <@Menitta> "who's footprints are these"
[1:05:50] <leith_aziz> Screentime he cant share with Venom. So no Venom I guess
[1:05:56] <@Menitta> WH
[1:05:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YOOOO
[1:06:01] <BlackermanZX> DAMN
[1:06:05] <+FuqBoiSlim> DUFFED
[1:06:12] <%Prevot> Miles will get screentime by being the one who has to fight symbiote peter
[1:06:20] <%dds333a> Good ol Tomb
[1:06:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:06:30] <brandonmani456> @WoolieVersus are you excited for Marvel's Spider Man 2?
[1:06:33] <Treasure_Vault> Jumping over a puddle and an invisible dude karate chops you in the neck
[1:06:35] <leith_aziz> @dds333a I have vivid, vague memories of seeing a little of it. Never knew the name
[1:06:55] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I get that, but with the way the game has been building Peter and Miles's relationship I feel like they need something has them be equals
[1:07:00] <+samuraiknack> Who do you guys think will be Venom? I can't see Harry lasting the whole game as him, I think it will be Kraven. Outside chance being Norman
[1:07:09] <lumihalla> yuri lowenthall goon? :D
[1:07:22] <%dds333a> It will definitely be Harry, I feel, the whole way through
[1:07:24] <+miakhalifaisoverrated> Someone say puddles?
[1:07:32] <%dds333a> It just won't ACT like Harry LUL
[1:07:40] <+eanscrale> Gee Spider-man what a cool thing to hook up your pal like that
[1:07:45] <%Shad0wTag> @samuraiknack I can see Kraven final bossing as Venom and losing control
[1:07:48] <%Prevot> the only acceptable venom is eddie, always
[1:07:52] <leith_aziz> You can always introduce Eddie Brock. I was actually expecting a Venom/Green Goblin teamup. But with Kraven introduced, I dont know cohhHmm
[1:07:59] <leith_aziz> Maybe he'll be saved for the 3rd game
[1:08:04] <%Prevot> if its not eddie, I don't even wanna see venom
[1:08:21] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Eddie can be a sequel hook tease
[1:08:34] <%dds333a> I'm pretty sure Norman is gonna do his shit In the sequel, we already said all his shit
[1:08:35] <+FuqBoiSlim> how did he not see that
[1:09:02] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Yeah, but wont that mean doing Venom against but with a different host? It wont hit as hard. Maybe Carnage cohhO
[1:09:03] <%dds333a> Kraven is there to be a major antagonist. and to provide an army of goons LUL
[1:09:07] <Make_me_mad> I feel like it might be Harry through the game proper, but he'll die dramatically towards the end and then the symbiote will go to someone like Eddie for the sequel game.
[1:09:12] <%Prevot> @leith_aziz having venom as a villain two times in a row would suck
[1:09:28] <%livlinn> LUL
[1:09:38] <casualshinji> Miles should just make a purple hoodie outfit; would work way better as camoflage.
[1:09:43] <%dds333a> where ther is a will... Kappa
[1:09:56] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Yep. Which is why I thought of Carnage. Either that or Eddie Brock is made as more of an anti-hero
[1:10:05] <Shockmaster182> I’m also not entirely convinced Venom’s gonna be the Main antagonist for the whole game, I could see him doing a face turn
[1:10:28] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz which is perfect. the sooner he goes full Lethal Protector, the better
[1:10:37] <leith_aziz> I doubt they'll do Agent Venom, as cool as that would be. cohhNotes
[1:10:43] <%livlinn> bike shiaHypers
[1:10:48] <agsiar2> how do web shooters work in this continuity? are the biological, home-made or what?
[1:10:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is that all bleach
[1:10:56] <%dds333a> home made
[1:11:10] <%dds333a> peter and miles have schematics and whatnot
[1:11:10] <+samuraiknack> @ddss333a Norman needs a reason to become the Green Goblins. He loses his cure, possibly Mayoralty, losing the Venom suit due to it rejecting him, choosing Spider-Man and then losing Harry would drive him over the edge
[1:11:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> i doubt we'll get a true Lethal Protector, since it won't be an M rated game
[1:11:20] <coreybom> @agsiar2 Home made.
[1:11:21] <agsiar2> i see
[1:11:28] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, Gravedust would've been a cool villain name.
[1:11:32] <casualshinji> Be careful about that M.U.F. Tombstone.
[1:11:32] <agsiar2> thx
[1:11:45] <Pookiedaexzile> You mean like Venom
[1:11:47] <%RyTYoung> You get a genke who can Kappa
[1:11:52] <%Prevot> @abelincoln_catpuncher they're making that wovlerine game so what if they followed that with a Venom game?
[1:11:55] <+SolidusRex> Condemned: Criminal Origins
[1:12:05] <%dds333a> @abelincoln_catpuncher yeah. I didn't mean literally, just in terms of characterization LUL
[1:12:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> Shit, I just got here. What did I miss so far?
[1:12:26] <coreybom> @abelincoln_catpuncher Maybe we might, since insomniac is also doing the Wolverine game, and that was all but confirmed to be M rated.
[1:12:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @prevot oh I'm super down with that, I just don't think in SpiderMan2 we're gonna get true lethality
[1:12:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Indigo_Automaton a few enemy hideouts

[1:13:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dds333a oh yeah i getcha mate, I just want to bite their heads off for a finisher lol

[1:13:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bet?
[1:13:47] <AngryAsian5> Talkin that shit LUL
[1:13:47] <leith_aziz> To be fair, a Venom game doesnt have to be marketed with teh same rating as Spiderman games
[1:13:48] <+toastybites> time to kill
[1:13:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dds333a YES
[1:14:00] <leith_aziz> It's Venom, people already expect scary stuff from him
[1:14:21] <leith_aziz> Remember the kid in Ultimate? Yeeeaah... cohhStare
[1:14:45] <Make_me_mad> They might do it like the Ultimate spider-man game did. You just absorb people into the symbiote goo with venom to avoid actually murdering them outright. Like, you still do, just don't acknowledge it.
[1:14:47] <AngryAsian5> Not dead LUL

[1:15:52] <youngking_kush> I love seeing the evolution of stealth rooms from Gargoyles in Arkham Asylum to being across the roofs of multiple buildings here
[1:16:06] <+mace210> goons talkin shit?!
[1:16:18] <+SoeSpooky> I wonder if they'd ever make a Superior spiderman game
[1:16:23] <civilized_worm12> you just killed that guy D:
[1:16:32] <%dds333a> @mace210 I always respect when they do LUL
[1:16:47] <brandonmani456> That's fire!
[1:16:56] <leith_aziz> @youngking_kush Over time, I realised how fun the Stealth of those games were. They're probably my favorite section by this point (the Arkham games, not Spiderman)
[1:16:57] <%dds333a> My favorite thing in videogames is when enemies taunt back
[1:17:05] <Shockmaster182> Man, these guys are fucking assholes
[1:17:36] <+samuraiknack> @SoeSpooky I think 3 will set up Superior Spider-Man
[1:17:48] <zashrin777> Spiders-Man is terrifying
[1:17:52] <youngking_kush> @leith_aziz Legit. The Spider-Man series has yet to match Arkham in that aspect IMO. You can get super creative

[1:48:39] <coreybom> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends Tony Todd did say the game was going to be bigger, so we might get queens and brooklyn, especially since those are Miles and Peters home turf.

[1:49:22] <+trackles_64> Spider fashion more important
[1:49:25] <Aussie_Manny> Does Miles have a Kamen Rider suit like Peter had?
[1:49:30] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus Its weird to think thats our tokusatsu themed suit right?
[1:49:30] <Pyrrhus90> "hey tony, look! its spiderman"
[1:49:38] <leith_aziz> @Aussie_Manny I think this is suppoused to be it
[1:49:39] <@Menitta> the problem is there's a much better Kamen Rider suit in the original game they added later
[1:49:46] <@Menitta> and it's got the comic shading too
[1:49:51] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Woolie makes a good point about Miles’ costumes being more street than tech. He just looks better in a hoodie and Jordan’s/Tims rather than a full high tech suit
[1:49:55] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta Agreed
[1:50:08] <leomuratore> @AWKWARDL0SER Agreed
[1:50:18] <leith_aziz> Im surpised they went to the effort of making an original Kamen Rider suit. Hope it gets used in something

[1:54:05] <jaygee303> That’s not it, you’re meant to get off it to beat the roof people, there’s no one on the chopper to punch
[1:54:07] <NeonBleu> Woolie's good at what he does
[1:54:11] <+capybruhArt> I think if you just hit the underground groups without touching the chopper it counts
[1:54:17] <@Solidus_113> looking online that seems to be a common bug
[1:54:19] <%elderpunch> !uptime

[1:56:02] <Aussie_Manny> I remember these. Stealth missions were the trickiest for me.

[1:58:43] <Fauna_NE> LUL
[1:58:47] <+theoldone001> It's Man-Spider
[1:58:49] <Fauna_NE> Couldn't do another take
[1:58:53] <Aussie_Manny> I guess it's good practice for dealing with real hostages.
[1:58:56] <OldManDeckardCain> it sure is nice being phantom thieves
[1:58:56] <@Menitta> these are also just around in public places
[1:58:59] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Peter Parker is a weird dude
[1:59:05] <NeonBleu> Spider-man is Miley Cyrus?
[1:59:12] <leith_aziz> cohhO
[1:59:12] <%Lion_kun> I think the Insomniac Spider-man games are great but there is something about the dialogue that is just cringe
[1:59:15] <Aussie_Manny> Daaaaamn.
[1:59:25] <%dds333a> It's like batman saying "Barb" or "Barbara" all the time LUL
[1:59:45] <+eGregiousGames> @Lion_kun agreed there are like very few actually funny quips
[2:00:00] <leith_aziz> @Lion_kun That is the most unexpected take I've seen yet, but you do you. Sorry to hear that
[2:00:33] <ultrabonezone> its a mix for me, some a just mid
[2:00:38] <ultrabonezone> are*
[2:00:49] <Awesome_Leaf> man we're gonna hear that fake people line a bunch arent we
[2:00:50] <ThornJay> i kinda like the even the cringy quips because it's nice to see spidey being a dickhead properly for once
[2:00:51] <%Shad0wTag> @Lion_kun What would you like to be changed os it's "less cringe"? Even though I think your take is mad I wanna hear what you would like it to be like instead
[2:01:08] <%dds333a> @awesome_leaf Kappa
[2:01:09] <@Menitta> I like the dialogue. it's definitely a bit trying to be hip but none of it seemed out of place for Spiderman.
[2:01:17] <%elderpunch> its not that insomniac dialogue is cringe its more so that humor in superhero media stinks lol
[2:01:30] <%Dabrikishaw> Pete could not have known about the camouflage power

[2:01:33] <moonmintparadise> I guess only Miles can see / hear them
[2:01:45] <ultrabonezone> tbh the whole holo missions are kinda weird
[2:01:49] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:01:52] <%Dabrikishaw> When he made these stuff challenges
[2:01:52] <Awesome_Leaf> lol
[2:01:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gotta use the power boxes man
[2:02:14] <%jinking79> he's hungry for gold
[2:02:18] <ThornJay> @dabrikishaw its a bid odd because the stealth missions would be insanely easy with peter due to the gadgets
[2:02:24] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:02:25] <Awesome_Leaf> crud LUL
[2:02:31] <leith_aziz> Unless it's VERY tryhard, very little stuff can "frustrate" me through being cringe. Heck, I hate using the word cringe
[2:02:32] <Estuko> LOL
[2:02:34] <%ZweihanderSteve> BREATH
[2:02:36] <Aussie_Manny> doodSad khadBonk
[2:02:42] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Same
[2:02:45] <%dds333a> @dabrikishaw that means Pete is REALLY training him LUL
[2:02:51] <%MajorCrasher> @dabrikishaw he did didn't. he expected Miles to stay out of view like he had to LUL
[2:02:56] <ultrabonezone> the banter in the game is great
[2:03:07] <@Menitta> I also don't like the word cringe. It's a catch all dismissive criticism that doesn't actually mean anything. Not based at all.
[2:03:09] <ultrabonezone> but i like banter to much
[2:03:12] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Hey chat, did woolie ever finish the rest of the combat training missions?
[2:03:24] <%MajorCrasher> based on what?
[2:03:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:03:26] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Besides this one.
[2:03:30] <+theoldone001> It's Spiderman, he's always been a dork. It's like expecting Batman to not be a brooding hardass. Plus Miles is still literally a teen in this, the dialogue kind of reflects that.
[2:03:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Professor_Dr_Muffins i think this the last one
[2:03:47] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta I feel the same way. I have the same feeling when people try using the term "too anime" as a detractor to things
[2:03:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Miles..... NotLikeThis
[2:03:59] <ThornJay> i can see why people could find it cringe tbh, but I also really enjoy how unashamed it is to be earnest about the sillly quips and dumb jokes
[2:04:00] <Awesome_Leaf> fake people NotLikeThis
[2:04:00] <deviljhojho_> the stealth trials can be ballbusters to gold tbh
[2:04:25] <%X2Eliah> Man this new Assassin's Creed x batman game is odd
[2:04:27] <%Shad0wTag> @theoldone001 I am convinced some folks want twitter/reddit humour in these games or something
[2:04:38] <Awesome_Leaf> sniped lol
[2:04:46] <%dds333a> boom headshot
[2:04:48] <ThornJay> @deviljhojho_ at least it's not screwball
[2:04:57] <ultrabonezone> man this is challenge is rough
[2:04:57] <%Plesin> lucahScoo
[2:05:00] <leith_aziz> Well, using the word cringe for me is being a hypocrite, considering I watch some anime, and once you're exposed to such a different culture, your standards for what is and isnt considered "cringe" no longer holds value cohhHmm
[2:05:02] <deviljhojho_> @ThornJay those DLC quests were true hell
[2:05:12] <NeonBleu> that rat tho
[2:05:22] <+kewlmyc> I remember this one. Getting Gold was a pain in the ass
[2:05:41] <ThornJay> miles not constantly saying "sheesh" and "W" and "bussin" is really killing my immersion
[2:05:44] <bigshedman> @theoldone001 Worse, gimme a Spider-man game where all the jokes is old meme-comics humor Kappa

[2:12:00] <%elderpunch> @X2Eliah yes

[2:12:09] <Dante_Namikaze1> @x2eliah kinda
[2:12:14] <Aussie_Manny> I don't know.
[2:12:16] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz I think we've been pretty good
[2:12:24] <leith_aziz> Leave no bug untouched
[2:12:36] <%dds333a> as is always the case with videogame maps based on actual locations, they are overall the dame except FAR less dense
[2:12:38] <bigshedman> @leith_aziz That's wrong and you should feel bad for having that opinion!
[2:12:39] <Aussie_Manny> The police have got that one.
[2:12:48] <+ElDragon_1> I had a lot of bugs on the PS4 version
[2:12:49] <%elderpunch> chat usually isnt uncivil from what i seen
[2:12:53] <+Cpt_Pilliwinks> I wish they would release this game on PC
[2:12:54] <%Lion_kun> The only time I ever remember the chat going wild was during the superbeast discussion over P3
[2:12:58] <Daxalog> Construct it on site
[2:13:10] <%Shad0wTag> @Lion_kun Wasn't that quite a while ago?
[2:13:15] <%elderpunch> @Lion_kun thats how persona fans be
[2:13:16] <DSD24> "Spiderman! Are we really doing this? Right now!?"
[2:13:20] <%Lion_kun> Yes it was
[2:13:29] <@Menitta> The PS4 version is apparently not as well optimized unfortunately
[2:13:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> stun then web em
[2:13:33] <leith_aziz> I feel like chat is uncivil most of the time in SCB, but that's a different topic alltogether. Wasnt my intention to bring that up
[2:13:34] <Aussie_Manny> So that was it? Cool.
[2:13:46] <%kyh9> Oh god, cringe podcast.  Put on JJJ talking about aliens
[2:13:57] <Aussie_Manny> Tombstone? Shit, that's actually interesting.

[2:16:25] <@Menitta> it's about da METS
[2:16:26] <Aussie_Manny> I remember Fast Travel changing when the overworld changed in Spider-Man PS4.
[2:16:30] <Aussie_Manny> It was cool.
[2:16:34] <mrtanaka111> @dds333a you just need to make NW once

[2:17:43] <+slayabee> NYC is wildin bruh
[2:17:46] <leith_aziz> I'd do it if I wasnt afraid of getting soaked in the ocean of all places
[2:17:47] <+theoldone001> Playing through the 1st game right now so I was wondering. Miles seems more interesting in the powers than Peter though.
[2:17:49] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag nearly EVERY other woman really
[2:17:49] <+DakotaMacDoodle> New York built differnt
[2:17:50] <Dante_Namikaze1> New Yorkers give no fucks
[2:18:02] <Aussie_Manny> No loading at all! Nice.
[2:18:03] <Wahrow> Comic books kids Woolie!
[2:18:04] <leith_aziz> @theoldone001 The Venom powers add some extra spice
[2:18:06] <+samuraiknack> New York children just built different
[2:18:15] <civilized_worm12> kids are ninjas
[2:18:17] <leith_aziz> But they might need soem balancing in the sequel
[2:18:19] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Would love to see Spiderman 2 start with pete or miles in therapy.
[2:18:21] <%Kaito_Cam> oh this one i remember this one
[2:18:22] <mrtanaka111> what if it rains
[2:18:23] <Aussie_Manny> S T E A L T H
[2:18:32] <%Prevot> S T E L F
[2:18:33] <Dante_Namikaze1> @theoldone001 that's because Miles has all of Peter's powers plus extra
[2:18:37] <leith_aziz> Oh my god, Miles a Bomb!
[2:18:39] <%dds333a> don't get asploded
[2:18:41] <+Based_Moose> Thanks peter
[2:18:52] <%Shad0wTag> This one is a little tough
[2:19:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Virgin Peter vs Chad Miles
[2:19:09] <%Kaito_Cam> in this challenges though it's faster to take them all out though
[2:19:12] <mrtanaka111> not seen
[2:19:18] <+samuraiknack> I remember this one
[2:19:19] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhh, I remember this one. This was easily the most difficult for me.
[2:19:20] <ThornJay> @theoldone001 i think the tradeoff is peters better tech, experience and he's physically a bit stronger? I think I saw something like even in game he does more damage, can swing faster and jump higher.
[2:19:30] <%dds333a> @mrtanaka111 of course, he was invisible Kappa
[2:19:36] <%pauperofthesouth> I'm glad there's no Screwball in this game.
[2:19:54] <Aussie_Manny> With those pants, he's ALWAYS camo'd. HahaThink
[2:20:00] <Dante_Namikaze1> @thornjay and to do not make miles feel completely overpowered he can't throw webbed up brutes
[2:20:01] <%Shad0wTag> @pauperofthesouth Oh god yes but just watch her be in Spider-Men 2
[2:20:07] <VincentGraves> these are required for the 2020 suit right?
[2:20:11] <%MajorCrasher> yeah screwball kinda sucked
[2:20:18] <%dds333a> @pauperofthesouth I loved how ridiculous she was LUL
[2:20:21] <%pauperofthesouth> @pauperofthesouth oh god. ur ight
[2:20:23] <@Menitta> Doing these unlocks the 2020 suit
[2:20:29] <+DJ_Dragoon> Yeah this one sucks tho
[2:20:33] <coreybom> @thornjay Yeah, thats the difference between Miles and Peter, Pete is smarter with tech building, is stronger and faster on general, and has experience.
[2:20:38] <Dante_Namikaze1> @shad0wtag if they do add her back hopefully she won't be annoying like she was in the DLC
[2:20:43] <%Prevot> I wouldn't be able to hando a game that has screwball AND danika
[2:20:52] <%Prevot> *handle
[2:20:56] <ThornJay> screwballs challenges where ass but she was also just not a great character. Like I was annoyed to have to interact with her.
[2:21:03] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta Its absolutely worth it and I have buddy in actual NY who's making the suit and helmet as we speak for cosplay
[2:21:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @prevot oh.....OH NOOOOOOOO
[2:21:08] <%dds333a> @prevot yeah, Danika needs to go in that case LUL
[2:21:20] <+theoldone001> 1st game is on sale for pretty cheap right now if anyone was interested in playing though it. It's great.
[2:21:21] <%Shad0wTag> @Dante_Namikaze1 I think she will be purposefully annoying for the joke that Miles has never faced her
[2:21:23] <@Menitta> That's dope
[2:21:29] <deviljhojho_> "Everyone disliked that"
[2:21:29] <+ElDragon_1> I didnt mind these. But Screwball ones were annoying as hell.
[2:21:39] <mrtanaka111> is he knocked down if hes dead?
[2:21:44] <%pauperofthesouth> @deviljhojho_ dsaKEKW
[2:21:47] <deviljhojho_> the worst part about the screwball challenges was screwball
[2:21:51] <@Menitta> I don't even remember Screwball lol
[2:21:54] <leith_aziz> Is Screwball just Gwenpool?
[2:21:56] <%Lion_kun> I remember as a kid, I used to watch the shit out of the Fox Kids Spidey show. As a kid I knew not of the concept of syndication. I watched the final episode of the show so many times hoping they would finally show if Spidey finds MJ only to be disappointed it reset to the first episode.
[2:21:59] <Aussie_Manny> "He can turn invisiblllllllllle NOW!" "...I can't do it on-command." "He can't do it on command!"
[2:22:02] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta I'm not usually a shill but check out CosplayNay on your socials man is a real NY man cosplaying as Spider-Man
[2:22:05] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz better
[2:22:06] <leith_aziz> I havent read about either in the comics
[2:22:15] <+Fefe41> I avoided screwball challenges because I loathed her that much
[2:22:28] <BlackermanZX> this challenge is hard
[2:22:44] <+theoldone001> The last Spiderman game I played was the one on the PS1 lol. I tuned out of super hero stuff a while ago but gotten back into it recently.
[2:23:06] <ThornJay> the only other mission related thing that annoyed me was when you'd be chasing a villian or a car and it wouldn't give you the triangle prompt despite being on top of them because the chase is scripted to be longer
[2:23:23] <%pauperofthesouth> @ThornJay oh yeah!
[2:23:39] <deviljhojho_> this one is a ballbuster tbh
[2:23:40] <%Lion_kun> I got a gold on all these challenges and it was super hard and super not fun.
[2:23:40] <leith_aziz> I played Ultimate Spiderman, WoS PS2, Shattered Dimensions, AS2 and PS4
[2:23:41] <rosemon5001> @ThornJay same
[2:23:56] <%dds333a> @theoldone001 you've literally only missed a few games worth playing
[2:24:04] <leith_aziz> Ultimate was probably my fave, but SD was a ton of fun as well pickyFocus

[2:24:51] <ThornJay> @theoldone001 I think my last one was the second amazing spiderman game. iirc they were actually pretty good and had a ton of suits. There was also a battle damage mechanic where the more you plated and fought with resting the more fucked up your suit and bloody you would get

[2:46:25] <%pauperofthesouth> there's a missable thing in this level before you go through the doors. I remember having to do the beginning over just to get it
[2:46:43] <QueequegTheater> @deviljhojho_ Imagine thinking I watch nu-SVU.  No thank you, the series ended when Stabler left.
[2:46:49] <deviljhojho_> @Jiggisnipe sometimes you just need some of that sweet 2:00 AM law and order
[2:46:53] <+ElDragon_1> Yeah they missed the Tech Part
[2:47:09] <deviljhojho_> @QueequegTheater good take tbh
[2:47:16] <%pauperofthesouth> lol
[2:47:21] <NireFuster> This suit is just making me wish we got a 2099 game, like a proper game just like this one but with 2099 Spidey. Edge of Time and SHattered Dimensions were incredible
[2:47:45] <leith_aziz> Hi. NO I MISSED THE SUIT
[2:47:47] <@Solidus_113> damn that suit glows nice
[2:47:50] <deviljhojho_> yes indeed
[2:48:06] <TheFramedWarlock> It would be cool if we got Peter sequels and then a bunch of sequels with different Spiderpeople
[2:48:08] <slackerunchained> "False alarm..." <ZAP!>
[2:48:20] <leith_aziz> @NireFuster Same. Im shocked teh havent been anything media-related to Spiderman 2099 alone. And no, I dont mean cameos
[2:48:23] <TheFramedWarlock> Like a Spidergwen spinoff, or a proper 2099 one, or Spiderman Noir
[2:48:23] <deviljhojho_> that guy is taking a smoke break
[2:48:35] <%PeteRocca> Guy chilling: Amma get beat no matter what, might as well chill
[2:48:51] <TheFramedWarlock> I mean 2099 is gonna show up in Across the Spiderverse so that's cool
[2:48:55] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Because as much folks say the 2099 media, whenever marvel do something no one bites and they ignore it again for x amount of years
[2:48:56] <Pookiedaexzile> I wanna SpiderPunk Side scroller like Mother Russia Bleeds
[2:49:25] <deviljhojho_> oh
[2:49:31] <%Shad0wTag> @Pookiedaexzile Spider-Punk is getting new mini solo comic this year so thats as close as it gets

[2:50:19] <%king_wragles> What happened to the guy that was hanging off that?!
[2:50:19] <leith_aziz> (im talking about the guard)
[2:50:19] <fluke_LKZ> Or a Spiders-Man game that is just absolute horror
[2:50:25] <Wahrow> Their suit prevents them from looking up
[2:50:28] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag Yes, but to be fair, now is when the entire concept of multiverses and multiple Spider-men is becoming more popular, which is weird because the concept existed since Shattered Dimensions and the Spiderverse event in 2014
[2:50:29] <QueequegTheater> Unfortunately, depth perception is NOT a spider power
[2:50:40] <%pauperofthesouth> the frustrating part of these stealth missions is when you do it perfectly stealthy and then WAVE 2 is IMMEDIATELY alerted

[2:51:36] <Aussie_Manny> WATSU APPU DENJA
[2:51:40] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Well heres the thing about 2 or so years ago Marvel tried digging up interest in 2099 and did some some minis based on 2099 characters including Miguel and nada. Prior to that in All New All Different Marvel they brought Miguel to 616 and once again nada
[2:51:42] <+theoldone001> Spiderman is no Batman when it comes to stealth in these games, I feel like it's inevitable that enemies get alerted.
[2:51:52] <%Shad0wTag> They keep doing it and no one keeps biting
[2:51:53] <leith_aziz> Isn't the writer behind Shattered Dimensions and Edge of Time the same person that went on to make the Spiderverse comic?
[2:52:05] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Dan Slott? Yes
[2:52:15] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag That's unfortunate... I'm not too huge on comics so I don't know about that, but it sucks to hear that not enough people are paying attention. Maybe because the spotlight right now is on Miles and Gwen I think
[2:52:18] <leith_aziz> The games were really what sparked the whole spider-verse idea. And yes, im aware of the 90's cartoonn
[2:52:20] <+CrimKangaroo> The last one is/has coming to pc, right?
[2:52:26] <%Prevot> Shattered Dimensions was good shit
[2:52:29] <%Shad0wTag> However I didn't know he wrote Edge of Time and Shattered Dimensions.

[2:53:15] <+theoldone001> I think Activision having the Spider-Man monopoly is what turned me off of Spidey games for a while.

[2:56:59] <NireFuster> It's always the editors that ruin those kind of stories right? I can't in good faith believe that a competent writer would write something like One More Day and think ''yep, ship it''

[2:57:58] <coreybom> @nirefuster The co-writer and Artist for One More Day was the editor in chief at the time, and yeah a lot of it is on him.

[2:58:04] <Aussie_Manny> So the bad guys THEN the chopper?
[2:58:07] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Its a long story but yes it was Marvel Editorial. Basically they didn't want Peter married as it aged the character from their perspective and they wanted to reboot without rebooting completely and give him a fresh slate
[2:58:09] <+capybruhArt> I'd get the chopper lock all the time too
[2:58:10] <leith_aziz> @Prevot I heard the Ultimate version of the clone saga was good. Dont know about the Miles stuff

[2:59:15] <%Shad0wTag> @Prevot Miles's clone saga was actually okay, totally non offensive. Rememeber the OG clone saga was bad because they could never make up their minds on ending AND it was the 90's too many comics were bad at the time

[2:59:51] <coreybom> @nirefuster Luckily enough nobody likes that story, and recent stories have hinted that its going to be undone, first by MJ and Pete getting back together and then going after Mephisto.

[3:00:58] <leith_aziz> @NireFuster As a kid in the past, I can tell you those types of readers would care about big events, shipping, and the status-quo changing. They probably would be all for change like that

[3:00:59] <QueequegTheater> Yes
[3:01:00] <coreybom> @theoldone001 Peters got some awesome suits. Hell, they gave him new suits recently for no way home.
[3:01:11] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Well thats the thing, like many media they need comic book characters to be timeless especially if they have proverbial mantle to pass down. So the idea was get rid of Peter's job as a teacher, get him his doting aunt, get him back at the bugle and make him single and depressed
[3:01:25] <Aussie_Manny> Eat SHIT, chopper man!
[3:01:26] <%MajorCrasher> honestly as a hot take, most comic stories suck and they mainly get bought for the art
[3:01:27] <+samuraiknack> I'm honestly surprised a nerd hasn't tried to shank Quesada. The fucker does One More Day and then One Moment in Time to justify it. He's a fucking menace

[3:02:16] <+Thatghostpepper> @Prevot yeah honeybadger
[3:02:22] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz a lot of kids I knew aren't actually all for the second or the third
[3:02:22] <%Prevot> @Prevot people aren't allowed to fuck and have kids, all new characters must be clones
[3:02:25] <+barrakuta371> They obviously never met Woolie
[3:02:31] <%Shad0wTag> @Prevot Oh you mean Honey Badger? Dude everyone loves her. But I doubt I could convince you that Wolverine Laura had a good solo run if that is an issue.
[3:02:32] <ThornJay> @nirefuster i remember him being pretty happy for a bit, then civil war hit followed by mephisto.
[3:02:46] <coreybom> @leith_aziz Well she’s wolverine now, so i guess they need a x-23.
[3:02:51] <slackerunchained> @Prevot The Marvel universe is slowly turning into the Resident Evil universe! :O

[3:03:35] <Daxalog> Coptor noise still in the background
[3:03:39] <%Prevot> @Prevot I don't hate the character, I hate that she can't just be the kid of any of the wolverine characters instead of a clone

[3:03:48] <+theoldone001> Mortal Shell vibes, the more you play the more shit breaks lol
[3:03:51] <coreybom> @prevot Except the older characters, Like The fantastic four and Bats and Supes. THEY can have kids.
[3:03:55] <deviljhojho_> suckers, even
[3:03:59] <leith_aziz> @Prevot Oh, they like her? That's great to hear. As long as people's happy pickyEZ
[3:04:08] <xxshadowxx416> comic logic character never grow up never plot progression
[3:04:10] <slackerunchained> Didn't Wolverine's ACTUAL kid turn out to be kinda a dick, tho? :\
[3:04:21] <Aussie_Manny> https://clips.twitch.tv/YawningTemperedOilKreygasm-StgNQWGXKlTQ_wPW
[3:04:22] <deviljhojho_> she aint having it
[3:04:25] <%Shad0wTag> @Prevot Well she's clone but she's a direct copy. She's own personality and asks a little sister to Laura. Without explaining the story it probably seems bad for you but the context really helps.
[3:04:33] <QueequegTheater> Perfect Dodge and counter
[3:04:33] <NireFuster> It feels like such a middle finger to the writers that spent like decades building Peter's character just for some editors to go like ''it's rewind time''
[3:04:39] <%dds333a> @xxshadowxx416 I only want my Peter to have shit luck and nothing else
[3:04:41] <%TubeMan642> charge dash

[3:04:51] <%dds333a> LUL
[3:04:52] <ThornJay> is x-23 not wolverine anymore? the only other thing i've heard from xmen in recent history is beast being evil and logan and cyclops double teaming jean
[3:04:52] <leith_aziz> It's a shame teh clone saga is what it is because I always thought Ben Reiley looked cool. Unfortunately he has the stigma of being part of that plotline
[3:04:55] <OblivionSword1> the dash command grab isn't it ?
[3:04:58] <coreybom> @slackerunchained He’s a dick, but he’s a wonderful dick. He’s a complete asshole and thats great.

[3:05:10] <TheeRabbi> Whatever
[3:05:16] <ThornJay> @slackerunchained which one?
[3:05:32] <coreybom> @thornjay No she’s wolverine again. Just two Wolverines, working different areas.
[3:05:39] <%dds333a> @nirefuster that's how it is LUL
[3:05:39] <+samuraiknack> @NireFuster But Spider-Man needs to be like when I was a kid
[3:05:40] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Did you miss a JJJ because of the bugs?
[3:05:45] <leith_aziz> Heck, Ben Reiley himself is probably a cool character
[3:05:58] <penitentpendant> @TheeRabbi TBF, I know of people that refer to that series as Sword Ort Anline
[3:06:04] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster You have nailed what comic book readers have been complaining about for decades my guy. Whats worse is they did again after All New All Different Spider-Man where Peter had a company called Parker Industries and he had to give it all up to go back to working at the bugle again
[3:06:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DEAD
[3:06:13] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay She is still Wolverine
[3:06:14] <ThornJay> @nirefuster i think that was the worst part, like iirc it erased alot of his history with several very important characters for no reason
[3:06:23] <coreybom> @leith_aziz Bens actually a great character. He was the highlight of the clone saga.
[3:06:25] <Tracazoid> It's cool that X-23 is still Wolverine, a shame DC backtracked on Dick and Bruce as Batman for Batman Inc. It was cool to see Dick grow and have Damian as his Robin, causing the little shit to soften up.
[3:06:49] <+charp35> They have to be thrown into the wall or on the ground
[3:06:49] <+MegaQuint> You can throw webbed enemies
[3:06:49] <slackerunchained> ...He says as he proceeds to lose to Spider-Man.
[3:06:51] <Aussie_Manny> oh no he's IN THE BOX
[3:06:54] <+dekkitout> Damian's practically fixed now
[3:07:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wasn't close to the wall or lying down
[3:07:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> No, you need to web them up and then throw them into a wall
[3:07:08] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus When they ON the ground to do it.
[3:07:14] <leith_aziz> @NireFuster You know, Im wondering why all comics are made to be canon with the exception of issues specifically made as alternate versions/dimensions? Crossovers? cohhHmm
[3:07:15] <%Shad0wTag> @Tracazoid Batman is its own issue oh lord. At least the Flash Family has it sorted, multiple Flashes or at minimum Kid Flashes
[3:07:19] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag I heard about that, I think it was the aftermath of the whole Superior Spiderman thing where Peter inherits Otto's company and then loses it all because... because? It makes Peter look so incompetent and like a big idiot
[3:07:19] <%jinking79> still have to slam them on the ground
[3:07:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> If they are LYING ON THE GROUND you can web them up
[3:07:23] <coreybom> @tracazoid New 52 was such a mess, and it coming at probably the most interesting time for DC comics was a pain.
[3:07:30] <%Shad0wTag> @dekkitout Aye Super-Sons gave people hope
[3:07:30] <+charp35> They only stick to the ground if they are lying down
[3:07:34] <NireFuster> I haven't properly read Superior Spiderman, or many Spidey comics for that matter, but I read about it and it sounds super dumb
[3:07:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:07:35] <Aussie_Manny> Chat, I hope you know what you're talking about when giving advice.
[3:07:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they either have to be lying on the ground, standing next to a wall, or you slam them into ground/wall
[3:07:43] <+Keith_e> they have to be knicked down
[3:07:48] <+dekkitout> @dekkitout I'm talking about the current Robin book
[3:07:53] <ThornJay> for some reason OMD made me like the fact that Peter in the ps4 game made the conscience decision to let Aunt may go way more
[3:07:54] <+SuperUnhappyman> jacket spiderman is the best look
[3:07:56] <JacknZack27> They have to be on the ground first
[3:08:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> Peter had a web bomb, I believe, that allowed you to just insta web them
[3:08:13] <NireFuster> @leith_aziz Comicbooks would be so much better IMO if they were all one-shots or just their own separate stories. These things would never become issues at all if all stories were isolated in their own worlds
[3:08:14] <+dekkitout> The current Robin book with Damian being an enjoyer of shojo manga
[3:08:18] <JacknZack27> No, thats not how it worked
[3:08:21] <coreybom> @nirefuster I think he loses it cause it technically didn’t belong to him. I don’t know it sucked honestly.
[3:08:33] <BoxFaceStar> Noooo you had to knock them down after they were max webbed
[3:08:35] <Fauna_NE> That lady was flabbergasted
[3:08:48] <+SuperUnhappyman> @NireFuster i think you would like dark ages which is its own contained univers so far
[3:08:51] <Aussie_Manny> They did it!
[3:08:53] <NireFuster> ??? Police actually doing their job??? PogChamp
[3:08:54] <JacknZack27> The weaker enemies had to be on the ground too.
[3:08:57] <Aussie_Manny> Good work, PDNY!
[3:09:03] <Arqartur0> I don't believe it
[3:09:06] <coreybom> @thornjay Funny enough, Marvel tried to stop that HARD. It took insomniac so much hard work to let them do it.
[3:09:07] <leith_aziz> @Tracazoid I think Dick is better off as Nightwing. He embraces the best aspects of Bruce Wayne while deciding on how things should be dealt his own way. Their dynamic is always great
[3:09:07] <deviljhojho_> a rare W
[3:09:07] <Arqartur0> those are not cops
[3:09:10] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Once upon a time things like 2099. AoA & MC2 were definitive futures and not alternate realities but Marvel then found it harder to commit to these grandiose things and eventually both comic lines waned in popularity so they stopped implying anything other than 616 was main continuity and soon as anything changes it shoots off and diverts
[3:09:18] <Aussie_Manny> DON'T MOVE

[3:09:49] <ThornJay> @nirefuster on one hand superior spiderman is a really good read, but on the otherhand it feels like it kinda just shits all over peter for no reason so it sours it for me
[3:09:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL

[3:10:17] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster He loses it all for plot reasons. He essentially sells all the stock around the world and makes it worthless making him broke and also making all his employees unemployed it sucked. I liked the whole Peter as the Spider-Man of the world and Miles as Spidey of NY
[3:10:20] <+mace210> *34
[3:10:23] <+Funkyfjord> That you know of
[3:10:25] <Tracazoid> I can see why you'd like Dick as Nightwing, I do as well but I do like the sidekick stepping up as well. Hell Nightwing and Robin as a duo would also be sick, not even Batman and Robin anymore.

[3:11:18] <leith_aziz> @ThornJay Ok, so there's one thing I dont understand about Superior Spiderman. I've heard it's great, but also hated? Is it because of future implications/aftermath or soemthing?
[3:11:22] <Aussie_Manny> It's so fast!

[3:11:30] <%king_wragles> I like the verbal threats to Spider-Man while he's kicking a dude so hard into a truck it almost tips over
[3:11:31] <+samuraiknack> @ThornJay Because Aunt May should have died, Peter becomes guilty, but tries to do right by raising Mayday how Ben and May raised him. Everyone told him to let May go
[3:11:33] <%imthewisejanitor> That man is dead.
[3:11:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> PERFECT, know what I mean?
[3:11:35] <penitentpendant> Fuck that guy in particular
[3:11:44] <%dds333a> @nirefuster But he is incompetent woolieF
[3:11:46] <NireFuster> @coreybom Well I'm not saying that comic books need to be under 10 issues long, but whenever a certain comic has like, hundreds or thousands of issues and a bunch of completely different storylines and re-writes and retcons and all the stuff we're talking about is when I draw the line and i just become so uninterested
[3:11:52] <TheeRabbi> Why those guys got the same dog collars as the thugs in Arkham Asylum?
[3:11:52] <+dekkitout> @leith_aziz The aftermath mostly

[3:11:56] <+Based_Moose> @imthewisejanitor ALMOST dead, key difference
[3:11:56] <%Shad0wTag> @Tracazoid Tim should inherit the mantle
[3:11:57] <Aussie_Manny> Huh?
[3:12:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> How did they put that there???
[3:12:02] <%elderpunch> WHAT
[3:12:03] <%Tuffty> Play enough of the game and fighting those guys are chumps, just as it would be for Spiderman
[3:12:11] <%jinking79> Balls of Fury
[3:12:15] <coreybom> @shad0wtag Rebirth was a breathe of fresh air. I hope with the major editorial cleasing they had we might get something like that back, especially since didio is gone.
[3:12:17] <xxshadowxx416> @leith_aziz it more of a doctor octopus then spider man
[3:12:18] <QueequegTheater> Balls of Fury was great
[3:12:19] <Aussie_Manny> Playing table tennis? That's a paddlin'.
[3:12:21] <TheeRabbi> as h e c k
[3:12:21] <NireFuster> @coreybom Also you can still have inter connected stories within their own universe too! Like Dark Knight Returns, its its own thing, but it does include Superman for example, but it is a pretty accessible and easy to understand comic and it's probably why it's so popular
[3:12:22] <+SuperUnhappyman> i agree with the tim comment hes a good detective

[3:14:08] <leith_aziz> @coreybom I like long arching stories as well. They have their quirks

[3:14:44] <leith_aziz> @coreybom Rebirth was the newer issue of DC comics after New 52, right?
[3:14:49] <NireFuster> @coreybom Long time comic fans already know the ropes and are used to this, it's probably common for you, but for someone like me who only read one shots or limited issue stories, I just find those to be a lot better because it's much less confusing or less tedious to get into
[3:14:54] <slackerunchained> His arms go out to FOREVER! :O

Like everyone just sorta dismisses the idea that peter isn't a hyperviolent asshole.

[3:16:41] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay @leith_aziz Pretty much, it gets a bit silly with how much Otto gets away with but it is enjoyable to watch him go? As he begins to sort of understand what it takes to have the mantle and what it comes with
[3:16:47] <leith_aziz> @coreybom Batman not doing fine lately? Aww, he's my favorite hero in all of comics, but I guess that's what happens when you keep running for over 80 years pickyPalm
[3:17:06] <NireFuster> @ThornJay Also people don't believe Peter when he says it was Otto in his body, right? With all the bullshit Spiderman had to deal with at that point, you'd think mind control is something people, including Black Cat would think ''Oh yeah that makes sense'', but no
[3:17:07] <Aussie_Manny> The map is so empty now!
[3:17:12] <coreybom> @nirefuster No i understand on that front. A good ending can be often far more satisfying then just continuing the story.
[3:17:15] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag the good aspects are fantastic but man do some of the bad aspects ruin it for me personally

[3:17:54] <ThornJay> @nirefuster i think it takes a fucking while before cat belives him iirc. like its way later after she goes through bad shit.
[3:18:01] <@Menitta> They're going at it jeez
[3:18:02] <coreybom> @leith_aziz I would say his main title is fine at the moment. The art is what carries it, but it’s not bad. Just okay.

[3:18:52] <NireFuster> @ThornJay Yeah that just sounds really dumb, you'd think she'd notice immediately that it's probably not Peter since she got pretty beat up and teeth knocked out

[3:19:38] <+theoldone001> I do like the camo pants of the other suit tho
[3:19:42] <TheeRabbi> So how does this game explain the nonstop super soldier enemies everywhere? Like Arkham City was "this is a criminal island, they're all marooned here,' but this is NYC and normal people are literally EVERYWHERE.
[3:19:52] <%Shad0wTag> @coreybom It became too nonsenical for me. I hated Perpetua and I hate Batman Who Keks even more
[3:19:58] <deviljhojho_> thsi is just another week for marvel's NYC
[3:19:59] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus It's in side.
[3:20:02] <ThornJay> @nirefuster I guess in the end what sorta kills it for me is that after ottos gone it basically feels like it only happened to make peters life worse or to showcase how he's apparently just completely incompetent
[3:20:03] <+theoldone001> Kind of wish you could just mix-n-match clothes
[3:20:05] <%Shad0wTag> @xxshadowxx416 Remind me what your replying to

[3:20:58] <leith_aziz> @coreybom Man, Batman who laughs was like everywhere with how popular he got. I wasnt looking at comics by that time, but it seems things calmed down since then
[3:21:04] <ThornJay> @nirefuster the second he sees her he attacks her and for some reason she never thinks something fishy is up. Like "oh this bastard peter definitely would do this I hate him now" and that's it.
[3:21:05] <NireFuster> @ThornJay I only read a little bit of the comics after the whole superior spiderman thing and I totally get what you mean. also isn't it the appearance of that other spider woman who is super clingy with Peter too?
[3:21:06] <+burnie_mcburntface> To get those hit replay base
[3:21:10] <QueequegTheater> @TheeRabbi That's just NYC

[3:21:45] <coreybom> @leith_aziz Oh yeah, he’s calm down in popularity. And thank god, i liked him before, but fuck did he get insufferable.
[3:21:53] <+burnie_mcburntface> You don’t you can get the part then leave
[3:21:53] <ThornJay> @theerabbi its just a part of life in the game I think. in he first one you go in the raft and its filled with metahumans basically.

[3:24:06] <+dekkitout> There's the Dennis system, what's teh Roxxon system?
[3:24:07] <NireFuster> @ThornJay Yeah, that one. I read some issues immediately after Peter 'comes back' to his body and she just kinda appears out of nowhere and it was SUPER weird and awkward
[3:24:09] <leith_aziz> NFTs dont hurt the enviroment. Stop panicking
[3:24:10] <%Prevot> believe in the story I'm telling
[3:24:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[3:24:11] <ThornJay> it's so weird seeing troy baker play himself for this role, great call by insomniac though.
[3:24:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> just believe it bro

[3:24:54] <TheeRabbi> No one can convince that that isn't supposed to be Musk, not Bezos. Musk is more the tantrumy, baby type
[3:25:02] <coreybom> @leith_aziz I think every creator when when they work on something long enough begin to run out of ideas.
[3:25:03] <deviljhojho_> he is like a fusion ya know

[3:25:25] <Aussie_Manny> Okay, I DID listen to Troy Baker on Alanah Pearce's podcast. He said he was fooled into that sponsorship; he says he didn't fully understand what it was. Choose to believe him or not.

[3:25:57] <leith_aziz> @Aussie_Manny I wouldnt be suprised, but wouldnt he be under contract not to talk about it or something?
[3:26:05] <deviljhojho_> thats mostly how it works. Every other type of media just cannibalizes the best bits of comics and leaves the rest

[3:27:38] <TheeRabbi> Musk is the type to have a secret team tracing all messages sent through Teslas and repo the vehicle of any user who said a negative thing about him. Bezos is the type to just shrug if you talk shit on his platform, because he just has zero emotion

[3:30:03] <NireFuster> @deviljhojho_ That's pretty much what I mean, yep. Since we're on Spiderman I'd add ''Spiderman Blue'' is also a pretty good one. Having a self contained story with a definitive start and end is just so much better than going on without a plan and a bunch of editors or writers messing up everything
[3:30:06] <%Shad0wTag> It has special animations
[3:30:16] <leith_aziz> Why does the suit look like a spec company trademark?
[3:30:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> ignore this
[3:30:23] <+capybruhArt> hotfeet
[3:30:24] <+dekkitout> @samuraiknack What would they give him? X-Factor was the weakest, but even that had a good bar for quality
[3:30:25] <+samuraiknack> Use a finisher with that suit Woolie
[3:30:32] <%RyTYoung> I wish you could get everything in the skill tree on your first play through NotLikeThis
[3:30:33] <BigYanno> Stealth was never an option
[3:30:40] <Aussie_Manny> yeah...
[3:30:42] <+theoldone001> Looks like one of those characters you'd see on old Graphic's cards
[3:30:44] <leith_aziz> Havit-Man

[3:30:58] <deviljhojho_> @NireFuster yeah, i know its in the very nature of the comics to have too many fingers on the pie but doesn't mean we have to like it
[3:31:03] <Aussie_Manny> I'd just dig a hole next to a big tree.
[3:31:05] <%dds333a> shimmy it LUL
[3:31:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> Ladder?
[3:31:17] <ThornJay> @kewlmyc also you didn't pay for suits unless they were rewards for the dlc stuff

[3:31:23] <%dds333a> just a ladder, really

[3:31:40] <%RyTYoung> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:31:41] <+Jiggisnipe> yea this one is crazy
[3:31:42] <enerkaizer> Comics just have the issue that they are too afraid to move on with characters. Even when a successor becomes popular they chicken out and bring back the first due to the 40+ old turbo nerds ruining fun for everyone
[3:31:44] <+dekkitout> Become the brick you were meant to be Miles
[3:31:45] <xxshadowxx416> did you see so of the graffiti in new york
[3:31:47] <+samuraiknack> @Dekkitout I think they would give him Uncanny or give him a new title

[3:32:09] <%Shad0wTag> DAZZLER POG
[3:32:11] <+capybruhArt> why do only weirdos get spider bites
[3:32:12] <enerkaizer> right, Dazzlöer is an actuall pop star in Marvel
[3:32:15] <NireFuster> Those are some pretty realistic looking tickets, damn
[3:32:16] <+hotleaf_juice> dazzler xmen ?
[3:32:21] <Aussie_Manny> Wait, Dazzler?
[3:32:21] <+birddotexe> dazzler hell yeah
[3:32:22] <+Prism_Zet> dazzler lol
[3:32:23] <leith_aziz> Oh?
[3:32:24] <%elderpunch> hey wait a min thats an xmen
[3:32:26] <+theoldone001> Eh Peter's backpacks kind of made no sense too, it's NY, you think a backpack on the wall is gonna stay not looted? Lol
[3:32:31] <Dante_Namikaze1> She's an X_
[3:32:31] <civilized_worm12> emo goth night in vegas PogCHamp
[3:32:33] <+birddotexe> There's also a Dazzler poster in Peter's room in GotG
[3:32:33] <Aussie_Manny> oh shit, i didn't post this one
[3:32:35] <Aussie_Manny> https://clips.twitch.tv/InterestingHandsomeElephantLitty-Wyv6_yhaIURsndbR
[3:32:39] <leith_aziz> Cool
[3:32:39] <%kyh9> LOTS of Dazzler in modern Marvel games
[3:32:40] <Dante_Namikaze1> *She an X-Man
[3:32:41] <%Shad0wTag> The mutant who gets away with beign a mutant cuz no ones figures it out
[3:32:44] <+dekkitout> Dazzler always gets pushed as an easter egg and I am fine with that
[3:32:47] <deviljhojho_> game devs LOVE dazzler
[3:32:48] <%Shad0wTag> And assumes its stage effects
[3:32:49] <+birddotexe> she can turn sound into light, which is an INCREDIBLE power
[3:32:51] <%dds333a> She had an ending in MVC3 with Felicia
[3:32:56] <Shockmaster182> @theoldone001 I just mean in terms of where they were placed
[3:32:58] <NireFuster> @theoldone001 Also pretty crazy how Peter's stuff is always conveniently webbed up even though they dissolve after an hour usually
[3:33:01] <ThornJay> @shockmaster182 but also no, because how come the web still stays years after the fact?
[3:33:03] <deviljhojho_> looks like a rave
[3:33:04] <Aussie_Manny> Do it.
[3:33:04] <gulthrax> Dazzler is lame
[3:33:15] <%DashXero> 'Bout to be a lot of hospital bills.
[3:33:17] <+Prism_Zet> woolie have you seen where people tag grafitti, there's no place I wouldn't get at as a kid
[3:33:17] <enerkaizer> Dazzler is just such a relic of the 80ies LOL they never figured out how to modernize her in the sligtest
[3:33:23] <NireFuster> Holy shit that guy is getting mugged by like 15 people

[3:34:02] <enerkaizer> .... Reggie doesn't know about the time peter had 6 arms, doesn't he?
[3:34:03] <leith_aziz> I'd be shocked if this wasnt part of a comic ntgl
[3:34:05] <%RyTYoung> YE
[3:34:06] <+eanscrale> I see miles is a fan of Hideki Kamiya
[3:34:06] <%Shad0wTag> WE REALLY DID
[3:34:06] <+dekkitout> You aint from Michigan if you aint done this!
[3:34:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WE DID
[3:34:13] <deviljhojho_> Shoulda told me
[3:34:14] <NireFuster> They did tell you Woolie! LUL
[3:34:14] <+birddotexe> GANKE, TURN OFF MY PAIN INHIBITORS
[3:34:15] <leith_aziz> NANOMACHINES, SON
[3:34:33] <%notsoy> THEY HARDEN IN RESPONSE TO PHYSICAL TRAUMA
[3:34:36] <Aussie_Manny> Miles should be like "WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT??" shotoD
[3:34:40] <%jinking79> and ppl sleep on this suit
[3:34:41] <NireFuster> Civil War? Aren't they from after?
[3:34:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i LOVE the iron spider suit
[3:34:43] <+samuraiknack> Anyone else notice the graphic novels on Star Lords shelves in the Guardians game have DC trade dressing and also the logo?
[3:34:44] <%Shad0wTag> I think they suited Superior alot more
[3:34:46] <leith_aziz> I mean people loved OG Spider-Armor
[3:34:49] <%dds333a> No, Comics Civil War
[3:34:53] <NireFuster> Oh right, comics Civil War
[3:34:54] <NireFuster> Yep yep
[3:34:55] <+Prism_Zet> @NireFuster yes, in both movies and comics
[3:34:59] <+dekkitout> Peter: "Miles, I made some superior additions to your suit"
[3:35:00] <%elderpunch> @NireFuster nope he got it in the civil war event in the comics
[3:35:00] <NireFuster> Iron Spider suit looks dope in the comics
[3:35:03] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster Nope, the iron-spider suit debuted right before civil war happened
[3:35:06] <NireFuster> Red and gold is super cool
[3:35:12] <+birddotexe> I'm a fan of the Future Foundation suit, myself
[3:35:13] <leith_aziz> It was right before Civil War comic
[3:35:14] <Aussie_Manny> Iron Spider.
[3:35:17] <+birddotexe> big googly eyed spidey
[3:35:19] <xxshadowxx416> civil war one or two
[3:35:26] <%Shad0wTag> @birddotexe based
[3:35:28] <ThornJay> shame it came from Tony "im a fascist who totally watched you fuck mj with my bird camera" Stark
[3:35:33] <enerkaizer> @xxshadowxx416 1. we don't talk about CW2
[3:35:37] <NireFuster> Man the end of Civil War in the comics sucked ass
[3:35:40] <%elderpunch> @ThornJay LUL LUL
[3:35:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:35:40] <+dekkitout> @xxshadowxx416 Listen here, you joker... psaFist
[3:35:48] <Jninjax05> And then Tony proceded to beat the crap outta Peter
[3:35:54] <deviljhojho_> WhySoSerious
[3:35:55] <%elderpunch> tony stark is a terrible person frfr
[3:35:56] <%dds333a> @nirefuster Cap got POPPED
[3:35:57] <+birddotexe> @birddotexe I need to actually get around to reading the run so I can stop being a fake fan
[3:36:02] <NireFuster> Tony almost killed Peter, that shit was crazy
[3:36:03] <Aussie_Manny> Missed a chache!
[3:36:06] <%RyTYoung> @thornjay …wut
[3:36:08] <leith_aziz> @NireFuster Wasn't it with Cap dying? I thought the end was iconic?
[3:36:21] <enerkaizer> It just speaks volumes how the film-makers could take a complete shyte-show like the civil war event and turn it into one of the best MCU movies. actually insane
[3:36:28] <%jinking79> both CW comics event  sucked
[3:36:29] <civilized_worm12> gabagool
[3:36:30] <Aussie_Manny> I HOPE HE DID LUL
[3:36:30] <deviljhojho_> n-no tomatoSmile
[3:36:35] <%elderpunch> i wish the mcu version kept the antagonism between pete n tony
[3:36:46] <GoogleyGareth> Sekiro english voice actor person
[3:36:50] <NireFuster> Cap did get popped yeah, I don't know about iconic, to me the entire ending fight and aftermath was super dumb
[3:36:50] <+GarouFGC> When people say 'spiderman with six arms' my mind always instantly goes to Doppleganger and not civilwar.
[3:36:57] <Aussie_Manny> Madon'! Maledetto Spider-Man!
[3:36:59] <%RyTYoung> @elderpunch oh shit didn’t realise they didn’t like each other in the comics
[3:37:00] <Djinnazz> did they check out the Spiderverse suit? I stepped out for a bit?
[3:37:01] <ThornJay> @rytyoung the fascist part of the part where he had a hidden camera in peter and mjs room?
[3:37:04] <TheeRabbi> No, he said Matrone. It's a married woman or a widow, especially a mother of dignity, mature age, and established social position
[3:37:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Djinnazz that was last stream
[3:37:16] <Jninjax05> I mean to be fair to civil war there was some good parts like the mini series they did revolving around Daily Bugle employees
[3:37:21] <%RyTYoung> @thornjay all the parts LUL
[3:37:29] <+dekkitout> @RyTYoung Smash cut to the current Cap & Iron Man team up book
[3:37:33] <%elderpunch> @RyTYoung yea tony is usually an ass to h im
[3:38:01] <%dds333a> @rytyoung they came to blows because Pete believed in the pro reg cause, which led him to revealing his identity
[3:38:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Just fuck em all up at once
[3:38:11] <enerkaizer> actually, Tony and Cap finally do bury the hatchet about the events of Civil war 1 in the current iron-man/Cap series. The even go about the 50 state initiative and how that fizzled out
[3:38:12] <ThornJay> @rytyoung prior to civil war tony and peter were really close, to the point of peter living in stark tower with mj and may. But through the civil war stuff their relationship pretty much complrtely imploded because comic Tony is a sociopath.
[3:38:14] <leith_aziz> Being an outsider and just "hearing" about all this is weird, since I've made my own assumptions off of the little I know from bits and pieces of different stories cohhHmm
[3:38:30] <%dds333a> this backfired, pete almost died getting ambushed by Jack o Lantern, and then he and tony came to blows
[3:38:32] <%RyTYoung> Holy fucking shit that’s insane
[3:38:39] <%RyTYoung> I gotta read me some comic books
[3:38:52] <%elderpunch> @RyTYoung read house n powers of c
[3:38:52] <+burnie_mcburntface> No you missed it go in the vent in the beginning and look down
[3:38:57] <+samuraiknack> Quick reminder that Bendis killed War Machine in Civil War 2 because he would die after seeing the trailer for the Civil War movie
[3:39:02] <%elderpunch> house n powers of x
[3:39:18] <leith_aziz> All of a sudden, Guilty Gear is pretty tame. Allthough, that's not a con, I like the lore of that cohhNotes
[3:39:24] <%Shad0wTag> @elderpunch All of Hickmans X-Men run is fantastic
[3:39:27] <%elderpunch> @samuraiknack wait seriously LUL
[3:39:29] <enerkaizer> Important to note: none of the writers involved with civil war liked the decision by the marvel higher ups how tony should behave during civil war 1, hence why ever author did let Tony get beaten up to hell and beyond for many years afterwards, including the hulk punching him through avengers tower
[3:39:32] <%dds333a> I CAN'T SEE HIM
[3:39:41] <Fauna_NE> I CAN'T SHOOT HIM
[3:39:46] <ThornJay> @rytyoung Tony "negative zone internment camps" Stark, Anthony "Nice tan Mj" Starky, Antonio "Killed a guy to make a thor clone to give his side more legitimacy" Starkio
[3:39:51] <leith_aziz> I CANT SEE HIM cohhBlind
[3:39:52] <%RyTYoung> @elderpunch thanks for the recommend that looks cool!
[3:40:07] <%elderpunch> i have a love hate relationship w bendis
[3:40:15] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay Hey don't forget to throw Reed under the bus as well he Negative zone camps were his idea
[3:40:20] <+dekkitout> Way of X, S.W.O.R.D, X-Force, Hellions, all also good recent/current X stuff
[3:40:20] <Fauna_NE> Jesus
[3:40:22] <enerkaizer> also: thor rightfully gave Tony also a beating when he returned and heard what happened during CW
[3:40:22] <NireFuster> I understand what that ending fight was going for with all the civilians holding Cap, but to me it just felt so... manipulative?
[3:40:33] <%Shad0wTag> @elderpunch I hate Bendis dialogue with a passion
[3:40:38] <leith_aziz> I thought Negative Zone was a DC idea? You know ,the Phantom Zone
[3:40:40] <NireFuster> I don't know, it just felt very weird and kind of a shitty conclusion to the entire conflict
[3:40:47] <leith_aziz> Didnt even know of this Negative Zone
[3:40:57] <Aussie_Manny> I'll look that up.
[3:40:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it might be like 1 or 2
[3:41:03] <Aussie_Manny> I'm curious how many finishers this has.
[3:41:16] <VincentGraves> there's one for the ground and one for the air
[3:41:20] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Dark matter universe that is shared between the multiverse thats infested with a never ending bug army
[3:41:21] <enerkaizer> CW copuld never have a good conclussion because its base premise would oom whatever side would loose. They were still repairing stuff that happened in CW1 just a few months ago, this event was that destructive
[3:41:24] <+samuraiknack> @elderpunch he saw the clip of Tony holding Rhodey and just assumed
[3:41:30] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag Reed "the psychotic paranoid government is correct for ruining my uncles life and killing him because its the law" Richards
[3:41:31] <+burnie_mcburntface> It’s at the beginning
[3:41:35] <%RyTYoung> @thornjay holy shit mcu tony starks characterisation got done dirty, civil war Stark sounds way more interesting but also unhinged
[3:41:42] <%Shad0wTag> everyone in CW was written horrendously
[3:41:43] <CanadianAdam> it's at the beginning before combat
[3:41:48] <%dds333a> the Negative Zone is analogous to the Phantom Zone, although. full disclosure, I dont know which came first
[3:41:52] <ThornJay> @enerkaizer that was fucking dope
[3:42:06] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz huh. Noted cohhNotes
[3:42:11] <+ElDragon_1> You missed it
[3:42:16] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay Reed ' i am being cucked by a fishman and I do little to stop it' richards
[3:42:31] <ThornJay> @nirefuster 9/11 truly was the hero all along
[3:42:34] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Phantom Zone came first
[3:42:36] <leith_aziz> This suit is growing on me
[3:42:39] <enerkaizer> current Iron-man run is btw really good. Tony has to deal with all the nonsens he did since civil war, and recently he gained the power cosmic
[3:42:41] <leith_aziz> pickyEZ

[3:42:44] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag Jesus that entire part was so awkward to read
[3:42:46] <%dds333a> @shaddydaddyo figured as much
[3:42:55] <@Menitta> more like it's glowing on you
[3:43:02] <leith_aziz> pickyAYAYA
[3:43:06] <+dekkitout> @RyTYoung I'll leave to the imagination of the madlad antics of Superior Iron-Man
[3:43:16] <%Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Wait is that in the Books of Korvac. I haven't read since him being Stilt Man on that colony planet
[3:43:18] <+StarPhoenix108> you missed it
[3:43:21] <%RyTYoung> @shad0wtag Do you mean CW comic or movie? I haven’t seen a lot of the marvel movies including CW so I’m clueless
[3:43:24] <ThornJay> @rytyoung iirc before the mcu ironman was worse I think
[3:43:28] <+Prism_Zet> someitmes woolie should read chat
[3:43:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is that where you came in from?
[3:43:38] <%notsoy> pre-MCU iron man had little to no redeeming qualities
[3:43:40] <%Deasmeister> I think you get in there at the start in the vents
[3:43:41] <xxshadowxx416> spider man multiverse
[3:43:41] <%dds333a> @thornjay VICTOR VON FUCKING DOOM was saddened by 9/11
[3:43:42] <BigYanno> come on spidey just break the glass LUL
[3:43:45] <+burnie_mcburntface> No you missed it go in the vent in the beginning and look down
[3:43:47] <%jinking79> gonna take them a while before they give up on it
[3:43:54] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Dude it could be worse, Ultimate Reed is just pure incel energy
[3:43:55] <+StarPhoenix108> on the way in
[3:43:58] <ThornJay> @nirefuster them not ending it with caps death just to kill after in a shitty follow up story was dumb
[3:44:02] <NireFuster> @ThornJay IIRC in the comics Iron Man was just an asshole, like straight up, just a giant asshole, MCU made him more charismatic
[3:44:04] <leith_aziz> Pre-MCU Iron Man was an alcoholic from what I understand.
[3:44:05] <%RyTYoung> @dekkitout Imma look him up woolieSHOOKREG
[3:44:08] <+Prism_Zet> @dds333a I liked that tribute, but that was SO weird
[3:44:14] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag after that event with stiltman he finally reacher corvac, and during their brawl he gained the power cosmic, which led to all cosmic marvels heavy hitters pretty much telling him "Don't over do it, OR ELSE!", right after he gave Corvac the JoJo Part 5 treatment
[3:44:24] <+CrimKangaroo> over the office
[3:44:27] <%Shad0wTag> @RyTYoung CW comic, everyone is written just awfully to be awful for plot reasons basically no one was in the right
[3:44:29] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag sue storm is way to hot for reed im sorry
[3:44:50] <%Shad0wTag> @notsoy Post Demon in a Bottle I would disagree
[3:44:50] <+dekkitout> @ThornJay The Fishman would agree
[3:45:07] <%dds333a> @thornjay comic writers agree with you. since Sue is PRIME Marvel cuckolding bait
[3:45:24] <%dds333a> she always gets NEARLY shacked up with someone else
[3:45:25] <ThornJay> @nirefuster i think he didnt even really invent to be a hero or make up for mistakes. it was just to pad his ego.
[3:45:28] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag The only character that was written ''correctly'' I feel, was Peter, and even then that's arguable because I doubt Peter would ever get convinced to reveal his fucking identity on like an international level
[3:45:34] <%Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Okay I AM SOLD. I will read this shit
[3:45:35] <@Menitta> all right I got to drive home. have fun everybody!
[3:45:39] <Aussie_Manny> @WoolieVersus Okay, looks like the special takedown activates completely randomly. For this suit, as well as a special post-game suit.
[3:46:00] <NireFuster> IIRC the whole register thing was to register to the government, not take off your mask in front of countless media and news outlets
[3:46:04] <leith_aziz> @RyTYoung Was CW always hated? I feel like if it was, it wouldnt have been talked about as much as it did. And im not talking about the infamous type of attention. Bring me up to speed  cohhNotes
[3:46:08] <CraZ80> @menitta see ya
[3:46:11] <deviljhojho_> its gonna happen when it happens
[3:46:14] <%RyTYoung> @shad0wtag ohh im guessing it must have been pretty decisive between fans whether they liked it or not
[3:46:14] <%jinking79> yeah that crat was a bitch to get
[3:46:16] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay But I will give him this, in Hickman's F4 at least he's a good family man there
[3:46:17] <%notsoy> oh yeah everybody was hating it as it happened
[3:46:27] <%notsoy> i definitely remember the shitstorms on /co/ and the constant mocking
[3:46:28] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag everytime you say CW comic im just picturing the cw shows but in comic form and the same bad quality
[3:46:38] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag The current Iron-man/Captain America series plays directly afterwards when Tony returned the power cosmic. and yeah, he and steve have a BIG talk about what happened during Civil war 1. It was really refreshing
[3:46:56] <Aussie_Manny> ahaaaa
[3:46:58] <NireFuster> @leith_aziz I think the only thing CW gets a lot of credit for is its premise and interesting ideas but I don't think they were correctly executed
[3:47:05] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Nah I'm with you there but I find it so odd that Peter would take such a risk and not expect any of the concequences
[3:47:06] <Aussie_Manny> Found it!
[3:47:07] <+samuraiknack> Confession time chat. The only modern X-Men I've read is early Ultimate X-Men and the first couple of issues of Bendis' run. I've also only read the silver age Jack Kirby and Stan Lee issues
[3:47:10] <civilized_worm12> YOINK
[3:47:14] <Aussie_Manny> 3 more to go!
[3:47:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[3:47:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no
[3:47:23] <deviljhojho_> i dont even read comics i just play the videogames based on them
[3:47:27] <+birddotexe> I've played so much Hitman lately, I keep expecting Diana Burnwood to turn up on comms
[3:47:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> missed the tape
[3:47:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh well
[3:47:40] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag Which circles back to the whole Mephisto thing and why that entire storyline is just so bad, Peter practically goes ''oh fuck, consequences for my actions?!'' and magically erases all of it
[3:47:43] <+shurtal> overall progress is Nice
[3:47:44] <BlackermanZX> 69% nic
[3:47:45] <ThornJay> @nirefuster besides how it ends, I actually kinda love spideys civil war run
[3:47:45] <+birddotexe> "Excellent work, Miles, now make your way to an exit."
[3:47:47] <civilized_worm12> yuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrr
[3:47:48] <%MajorCrasher> confession time chat. I've never read a comic book
[3:47:48] <+Prism_Zet> @samuraiknack Ultimate x men are okay, most of the ultimates were fine
[3:47:51] <deviljhojho_> lookin good
[3:48:02] <Aussie_Manny> doodShake
[3:48:03] <%MajorCrasher> I just listen to people talk about them on YouTube LUL
[3:48:06] <leith_aziz> I dont read comics either, but they are the reason for the games/movies I watch existing in teh first place. A lot of them are adaptations
[3:48:11] <%Shad0wTag> @RyTYoung It was regarded quite well at the time but as time progressed people realised how stupid the arguement was and how out of character alot of people involved was
[3:48:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no i mean the room with the crate you just got, there was one there too
[3:48:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[3:48:20] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster and the funny thing is that Miles story arc were he makes a deal with mephisto is leagues and miles better then peters, because his story actually made sense and made a point about deals with devils
[3:48:22] <casualshinji> His feet look like they'd burn through the concrete.
[3:48:23] <NireFuster> @ThornJay I don't hate it, I only read little of it, I love the Peter vs Kingpin fight on the prison, that was hype as fuck
[3:48:23] <xxshadowxx416> renew your vows is ok
[3:48:27] <Aussie_Manny> Okay, this is more believable.
[3:48:29] <+SolidusRex> The rocks have more friction
[3:48:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this one feels believable
[3:48:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> my home
[3:48:33] <deviljhojho_> vintage sauce
[3:48:39] <leith_aziz> The Dark Knight Returns, which I found great came from a comic first
[3:48:42] <%RyTYoung> Also meant divisive not decisive, it’s been a long day chat NotLikeThis
[3:48:42] <+dekkitout> 💯
[3:48:43] <%dds333a> keep that shit bottled forever
[3:48:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> go ride a bike or something
[3:48:44] <%MightyDuckShoes> Wow...
[3:48:44] <%Prevot> boy that shit must be rotten by now
[3:48:44] <civilized_worm12> taco bell sauce
[3:48:46] <%Plesin> Fucking Morbius just comes out of the shadows
[3:48:47] <fluke_LKZ> I dunno, not a lot of needles hidden under that rock
[3:48:51] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> oh I bet that sauce is delicious right now
[3:48:54] <deviljhojho_> the garlic is the best part
[3:48:56] <+samuraiknack> Prism_Zet I hate all the hate for the Ultimate universe now
[3:48:57] <jockymongy> "I put that **** on everything!"
[3:49:14] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer Sorry but I don't think I know what you're referring to?
[3:49:17] <Aussie_Manny> Hot Ones should try some of that.
[3:49:18] <+vexion_smh> I just know it smells great with garlic
[3:49:21] <+Reverend_Roscoe> atta girl
[3:49:21] <leith_aziz> And yeah, I like people talking about comics and expressing what makes them great or why they find it great. Taht's how I found out about Ultimate Spider-Man
[3:49:22] <%Shad0wTag> @RyTYoung So at first it was very well liked but it was a lot of peoples first comic book event and as time progressed people realised how much of it is predicated on people being out of character
[3:49:22] <%MightyDuckShoes> You Are Missing Out Woolie!!!! You need to get that shit!
[3:49:23] <haisho> spiced vingar with dried chilies and garlic
[3:49:24] <+birddotexe> calabrian chilli, mmm
[3:49:28] <NireFuster> I don't know much about Miles' story
[3:49:33] <jorniev> man I cannot handle that level of hot sauce
[3:49:34] <%diegobandzz> Yooooo
[3:49:35] <deviljhojho_> and some chile piquin
[3:49:37] <Aussie_Manny> omg that sounds delish
[3:49:39] <%diegobandzz> That shit is fireee
[3:49:40] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay I'm so sorry I would never inflict that on you
[3:49:44] <+Ornightz> They got those on Amazon it's really tasty
[3:49:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1483311049713635328?s=20
[3:49:45] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster Miles actually got a story where he made a deal with mephisto himself. Look it up, it is actually very well written
[3:49:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> Woolie wants that "Kill me" sauce
[3:50:00] <ThornJay> @nirefuster the registering stuff wasnt without merit. The catalyst was when during a reality tv show or something a hero team blew up a school. It was the whole hunting people down, violently assaultimg them and locking them in negative auschwitz that kinda soured their point.
[3:50:05] <%diegobandzz> Get some grout 🤤🤤🤤
[3:50:08] <+dekkitout> I need spice that convinces me to tell my loved ones I love them just in case
[3:50:13] <deviljhojho_> big brained
[3:50:16] <%mr_sups> There's video evidence
[3:50:23] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer Huh, interesting
[3:50:24] <%Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Huh go figure. Anything to retroactively ignore Civil War 2 BECAUSE THAT IS SOME GARBAGE
[3:50:29] <%diegobandzz> My ex used to make homemade pepper sauce
[3:50:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> like the hot sauce from spongebob
[3:50:38] <+birddotexe> I like the vinegar-y hot sauces though, it needs to be tart AND hot
[3:50:39] <%dds333a> @thornjay yeah, Stamford was the inciting factor, and that made sense
[3:50:39] <civilized_worm12> woolie should do a hot ones vid
[3:50:41] <%mr_sups> 'Member Hot Pepper Gaming?
[3:50:44] <Aussie_Manny> Young Money, Cache Money
[3:50:47] <+samuraiknack> My stomach hates all this talk of hot sauce
[3:50:53] <%dds333a> and out of that, we got PENANCE LUL
[3:50:58] <%Shad0wTag> @samuraiknack Its alright man, always time to pick up something else if you ever want to! Or do don't either!
[3:50:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> we hid this one in a homeless encapment
[3:51:01] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster also, unlike with Peter, Miles encounter with Mephisto had lasting consequences for everyone involved
[3:51:10] <%Plesin> Yeah it's mission based
[3:51:10] <Aussie_Manny> Yes, Ganke, an assault to my ears when I hear Jameson's podcast.
[3:51:11] <NireFuster> @ThornJay I read CW recently and I kinda liked the more grounded nature it takes at the beginning where it feels like a natural response to not trust these masked super powered humans in pajamas going around without proper knowledge of their activities, but it's pretty much only the idea that I like bcause the execution was super poorly done
[3:51:12] <%dds333a> The ultimate example of turning a plucky hero like speedball into EDGE
[3:51:23] <Dante_Namikaze1> it's dictated by story until you beat the game
[3:51:25] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag as I said, we do not talk about CW2
[3:51:33] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer If the Miles thing comes after Peter's deal with Mephisto, then it better, otherwise they wouldn't have learned nothing
[3:51:34] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Aunt May was meant to die like 4 fucking times LET THE OLD BAG GO PETE
[3:51:41] <leith_aziz> cohhO
[3:51:58] <%RyTYoung> @shad0wtag I feel like giving it a quick read through now just to get my take on it, however I don’t want to go off of what I know the characters to be like through the movies if they’re not faithful to the comics
[3:51:59] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag Poor May wants to go back to Ben already and they just won't let her die LUL
[3:52:01] <+MegaQuint> Even better. It's on the train
[3:52:04] <+birddotexe> teenage boys have zero self-preservation instincts
[3:52:14] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster unlike with peter everyone remembers Miles making the deal. No memory alteration. many people found out what he did
[3:52:16] <%dds333a> @deviljhojho_ did you like Ultimate Alliance 2 LUL
[3:52:19] <%Deasmeister> On a train?
[3:52:22] <+dekkitout> All it took was talking about Speedball to remember that Champions arc, Outlawed. Tl;dr- no teenage supers PunOko
[3:52:26] <+condemned_15> not a bug
[3:52:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT
[3:52:37] <deviljhojho_> @dds333a i thought it waas real solid but i remember liking 1 more for some reason
[3:52:39] <%Pillagius> lol
[3:52:39] <Aussie_Manny> OMG
[3:52:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[3:52:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> yeee
[3:52:41] <deviljhojho_> dont quite recall why tho
[3:52:41] <+taggerung403> What if MCU Peter tried to get Mephisto to bring May back
[3:52:42] <AngryAsian5> WHAT
[3:52:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> kinda a bug
[3:52:44] <BlackermanZX> BRUH
[3:52:45] <Aussie_Manny> DAMN IT, PHIN AND MILES
[3:52:45] <+ElDragon_1> Not a bug
[3:52:49] <reonome> HOW???
[3:52:50] <deviljhojho_> this one took me 20 minutes
[3:52:54] <+kewlmyc> HOW WAS IT NEVER REMOVED!?
[3:52:57] <%dds333a> Where it adapts Civil War, nd then swerves in the third act to have a fight with NANITE NICK FURY, featuring the Tinkerer
[3:52:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> literally a feature
[3:52:58] <AngryAsian5> New York kids are built different I guess. LUL
[3:53:00] <BlackermanZX> the hell is wrong with kids these days
[3:53:01] <xUrbanCarnage> Got eem
[3:53:02] <civilized_worm12> ???
[3:53:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> damn kids
[3:53:05] <%pi_in_the_sci> That was the first one I picked up

[3:53:14] <%RyTYoung> doodYelp
[3:53:16] <civilized_worm12> like what and where? LUL
[3:53:26] <%ZweihanderSteve> thanks wakanda
[3:53:26] <deviljhojho_> yeah that shit was fuckin funny tho
[3:53:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:53:28] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay DON'T FORGET THE HIRING OF ACTUAL VILLAINS AS POLICE
[3:53:29] <Aussie_Manny> Oh shit, so Wakanda was showing off vibranium tech?
[3:53:29] <+dekkitout> Where's that flag first debut? I only remember it from Coates books
[3:53:32] <leith_aziz> @Shad0wTag By having you explain all this to me, I only wish to hope you enjoy this hobby and not feel like you're constantly reading crap. The reason I bother with Guilty Gear is because I find it interesting and am invested. Hope you feel the same with comics. cohhL
[3:53:33] <deviljhojho_> even more because i liked using fury back in UA1
[3:53:41] <+condemned_15> yo TChalla's sis is anti vax LUL
[3:53:41] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[3:53:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> i gotta think about some thing
[3:53:48] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Wait, so the plot of this game is inspired by Wakanda tech? Awesome!
[3:53:50] <%ZweihanderSteve> UH MAYBE
[3:53:58] <Aussie_Manny> doodSad Things change.
[3:54:03] <leith_aziz> Aww, this me with my sister pickySad
[3:54:06] <+vexion_smh> oop
[3:54:12] <%Prevot> and then she became a criminal instead
[3:54:21] <reonome> LUL
[3:54:21] <ThornJay> @nirefuster the whole process of peter choosing one side slowly having everything fall apart as consequence, realise he was wrong, own up and then do the right thing was something I loved though. I also liked how they at least TRIED a little to show that there were some merits to the registration side unlike most stuff where that side was basically pure evil.
[3:54:30] <Aussie_Manny> I was thinking Truman Show.
[3:54:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> naturally you can glitch your way over there
[3:54:37] <civilized_worm12> newwwww yooorkkkkk
[3:54:40] <Aussie_Manny> Come ooooon, special finisher!
[3:54:41] <%notsoy> only way you get to leave is by airplane, and the only flights are to wakanda and kamurocho
[3:54:42] <%Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Agreed
[3:54:48] <xUrbanCarnage> You can’t escape from Brooklyn fate
[3:54:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> meeting time
[3:54:51] <VincentGraves> Woolie there's another animation in the air with that suit
[3:54:52] <BlackermanZX> waiting for the kaiju to pop up
[3:54:56] <%dds333a> @birddotexe can agree, was once a teenage boy
[3:54:56] <%RyTYoung> “That’s just the way it is, things will never be the same” wise words from Tupac woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:54:58] <%Prevot> damn
[3:55:02] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag Oh yeah that was the most ridiculous thing I ever read, just outright ridiculous, legitimately almost killed Peter because of that little stunt, Iron Man is such a prick in the comics
[3:55:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Hope chat has played/watched 13 Sentinels I guess
[3:55:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEET
[3:55:13] <Aussie_Manny> OOOHHHHH
[3:55:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEAD
[3:55:14] <%Shad0wTag> @RyTYoung By all means have a read of it, the tie ins as well do have some importance on it. Make your opinions
[3:55:21] <xxshadowxx416> only for wolverine japan
[3:55:22] <BlackermanZX> NOT DEAD AT ALL
[3:55:22] <%Double_Tap_That> You that guy was fucking murdered
[3:55:28] <Make_me_mad> What was your plan guy
[3:55:32] <Fauna_NE> played
[3:55:33] <Enyoyable> he returned to his home planet
[3:55:35] <leith_aziz> YEEEEAAAAH
[3:55:39] <leith_aziz> Spider-Drip
[3:55:40] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster The real Mephisto deal was making  May immortal but in constant agony
[3:55:40] <%andrewofbob> Self-defenced off the roof
[3:55:45] <NireFuster> @ThornJay Oh yeah Peter was pretty well written throughout that story, like I said there's a lot of cool ideas and elements that are interesting to consider but ultimately it just falls flat
[3:55:52] <%dds333a> @make_me_mad fight
[3:55:54] <Aussie_Manny> Still a couple of caches.
[3:56:04] <%Shad0wTag> @taggerung403 don't even make that joke
[3:56:21] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag May will continue to exist and live even after Earth is destroyed and the sun blows up
[3:56:23] <ThornJay> i never read CW 2 but i've never seen anything where peter actually helps miles. Does he not or is that just hard to find online?
[3:56:30] <Aussie_Manny> It's IN the mission again. Ugh... lytBORK
[3:56:31] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a You're talking about Ultimate Alliance 2 right?
[3:56:31] <%jinking79> just realize did woolie find the Statue?
[3:56:45] <NireFuster> Well now that i think about it, doesn't NWH kind of adapt the whole Mephisto thing but... better?
[3:56:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:56:56] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag you known it
[3:56:56] <Aussie_Manny> Is it just me, or is Miles swinging with more confidence now?
[3:57:06] <%RyTYoung> @shad0wtag I’ve got a week off work so I’ll give it a go doodDerp hopefully there are good scans online
[3:57:07] <+vexion_smh> the devs really had fun with the animations they look so fucking good tho
[3:57:10] <The_Grand_J> it's them tricks
[3:57:13] <leith_aziz> @NireFuster I think the Peter aspect of CW was what made me think it was generally liked. Because there's this content creator who covers Spiderman stories and he basically elaborated on Peter's part in CW and why it was great. cohhO
[3:57:22] <enerkaizer> @ThornJay Plothole. CW2 was terribly written. It ends, no joke, the same way Poochie got written out of itchie and stracthy in the simpsons. The main antagonists gets defeated like that in CW2
[3:57:22] <QueequegTheater> I miss the matter suit already
[3:57:28] <ThornJay> @nirefuster  I think its civil war where wolverine has a great detective run finding out what really happened, I might be mixing that with something else thoughm but apparently its great
[3:57:30] <+dekkitout> @Aussie_Manny With the exaggerated confidence of an urban youth
[3:57:37] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Nah I dont hate comic books, I accept their stupidty as the norm. I have my fun where I can and I suffer when I can too. If I don't like where something is going, I just stop reading, don't worry
[3:57:39] <Aussie_Manny> bruh
[3:58:19] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster To be honest they have decades trying to fix or double down on this
[3:58:21] <Mundkipz> did they finish the cat quest?
[3:58:26] <Aussie_Manny> Maybe it only appears after the fight? Ugh... lytWIPED
[3:58:28] <+condemned_15> i think you have to finish the hideout
[3:58:30] <%dds333a> yes
[3:58:36] <ThornJay> @enerkaizer okay that genuinely kinda pisses me off. The idea that peter wouldn't throw hands over that kinda annoys me.
[3:58:55] <BlackermanZX> did you try that door before entering the mission
[3:58:57] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Remember that time May became a herald of Galactus and was called the Golden Oldie
[3:59:14] <+burnie_mcburntface> Abandon the mission it’s available in the open world
[3:59:15] <%dds333a> @shaddydaddyo that is fantastic LUL
[3:59:17] <enerkaizer> @ThornJay Trust me, nobody liked CW2. There is a reason that events had no influence what so ever on the comics in the grand scheme of things
[3:59:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> *becomes ragdoll
[3:59:20] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag I'm in complete awe at every word in that sentence I have no idea what you're talking about but I don't doubt that it's all true LUL
[3:59:21] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Honestly I really enjoyed the game a kid back the
[3:59:23] <xxshadowxx416> why does spider man never go to yonker
[3:59:28] <+dekkitout> @NireFuster Those are the antics I long for
[3:59:30] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Cool? I just hope you love it when you find a cool comic. One's gotta enjoy their hobby pickyLove
[3:59:32] <Aussie_Manny> @burnie_mcburntface You sure?
[3:59:42] <%Shad0wTag> @RyTYoung They are indeed readcomicsonline has the whole thing. Search a reading order
[3:59:57] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag remember that time aunt may got banged by "perso  who hates spidermans guts"
[4:00:05] <+dekkitout> @NireFuster Thighnos exists. So flip a coin if you wanna believe.
[4:00:19] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag so did I, the swerve in the third act introducing The Fold always made me chuckle
[4:00:24] <ThornJay> Carol "Thought crimes are worse tham real crimes" Danvers
[4:00:24] <leith_aziz> For you who read the comics, can you recommend me some Miles stories? Which were his best? You can even spoil why. Im curious
[4:00:25] <civilized_worm12> PogChamp
[4:00:32] <%RyTYoung> @shad0wtag thank you doodGood
[4:01:00] <%dds333a> although "as a kid", oh boy LUL
[4:01:06] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster This was like in the 60's in the same time where a what if of Aunt May got bit by a spider and called herself Spider-Ma'am. FYI she even appeared in Spider-Verse
[4:01:10] <NireFuster> IIRC, Miles gets better after Spiderverse because if I'm not mistaken originally Miles is like, super dull as a character and basically just indistinguishable from Peter right?
[4:01:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Swing Kicking Guys off roofs would save a lot of trouble
[4:01:16] <enerkaizer> @leith_aziz This game and the movie. The comics did Miles no favor. Hios current story is interesting (with miles going through his own clone saga), but otherwise there isn't much there sadly. sorry

[4:01:37] <%andrewofbob> andrewofbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Mentioning 13 Sentinels reminded me that I went out and bought it after watching your playthrough; going through the story for a second time personally was like re-watching a mystery and appreciating all the subtle foreshadowing. Chat, go buy it.
[4:01:39] <+samuraiknack> Can we go back to shitting on Reed? Ben is all like "I'm what Susie called me The Thing" and Reeds like cool imma be Mr Fantastic
[4:01:40] <leith_aziz> I guess "new" Miles is still pretty new
[4:01:51] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Also game had a good roster if I recall and good alternate costumes too
[4:01:55] <leith_aziz> Well, at least they're on the right track now
[4:01:56] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag Aunt May is a catch, not gonna lie
[4:02:02] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag Oh yeah I know about that, her suit looks absolutely ridiculous and I love it, iirc comicbooks had a lot of 'what ifs' stories and such
[4:02:05] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay OH MAN CAROL IN CW2 HOLY SHIT
[4:02:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> focus miles
[4:02:11] <Aussie_Manny> HE THREW THE HAMMER?!
[4:02:23] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag IT DID. alt costumes and team bonuses out the wazoo
[4:02:25] <ThornJay> @nirefuster oj miles was just peter lite im pretty sure
[4:02:26] <enerkaizer> also, for everyone who doesn't know: miles has a baby sister now, and thanks to her he is now friends with the ryhno (Rhynos niece is in the same daycare as Miles sister)
[4:02:28] <+chadcialist> Let's not forget Miguel and his AI waifu
[4:02:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie definitely needs to change his tactics, the game is going to get ROUGH later if you don't
[4:02:35] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Pretty much just pick up with Ultimate Spider-Man and keep going
[4:02:42] <+TheMilkiestShake> Feels like they put too many enemies in areas in this
[4:02:43] <%dds333a> @chadcialist LUL LUL SeemsGood
[4:02:56] <NireFuster> @ThornJay That's pretty much the general consensus I read, pretty much just Peter until Spiderverse comes up and makes Miles more interesting and unique as a character
[4:03:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> picking peopleo ff by kicking them off roofs isn't clean, but it's safest way to pick them off
[4:03:10] <ThornJay> @samuraiknack smh at sue settling for worse stretchy dude when she could have DOOM
[4:03:14] <leith_aziz> GGs
[4:03:16] <Aussie_Manny> Now cache appears?
[4:03:17] <+dekkitout> @enerkaizer That's the Saladin Ahmid series right?
[4:03:27] <Aussie_Manny> There it is!
[4:03:40] <Dakuu75> Hospitals must literally be filled to the brim with Spiderman's victims
[4:03:47] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag remember that time hawkeye fucking domed bruce
[4:03:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:03:47] <enerkaizer> @dekkitout Sadly I don't remember the writers name, sorry.
[4:03:48] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster You are correct, Miles starts off strong but has recognizable traits other than he started out even younger than peter did, had even more powers and is double the minority of black and hispanic. After Spider-Verse they made him a more believable human being?
[4:03:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> is this THAT building by chance, the one that won't let you get teh box if you don't move the crane?
[4:03:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> hidden wall
[4:03:56] <Aussie_Manny> Okay, I don't think that gate wasn't webbable previously.
[4:04:02] <Aussie_Manny> I didn't see that prompt there before.
[4:04:07] <+condemned_15> you did have to beat it
[4:04:14] <Aussie_Manny> i think* that gate wasn't webbable
[4:04:17] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:04:20] <QueequegTheater> Oh no it was a load-bearing collectable
[4:04:20] <Dakuu75> wtf lol
[4:04:23] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Uncle Ben SAW SOMETHING MAN
[4:04:28] <Dakuu75> "k, i'm bored, PEACE~!"
[4:04:31] <ThornJay> miguels the one that beats his love interest right?
[4:04:31] <leith_aziz> Is Woolie trying to 100% im assuming?
[4:04:37] <NireFuster> @Shad0wTag Does Miles get any drawbacks for having more superpowers? I mean he has the same powers as Pete plus two more with the zap and cammo thing
[4:04:39] <+taggerung403> I seem to remember Ultimate Nick Fury saying Peter Parker could have become the next Captain America, I thought that was a cool concept
[4:04:42] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz he just might
[4:04:47] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Honestly I never liked Mac Gargan Venom so was I glad I could change that
[4:04:49] <enerkaizer> Miles only got 1 interesting stiory before spider-verse happened, and that was during the return of Peter Parker. Before they killed off the Ultimate imprint they wanted to turn ultimate peter Parker into that universes Ben reily. They had set up everything for that so he could mentor Miles
[4:04:51] <Aussie_Manny> just Kool-Aid Man it.
[4:04:55] <leith_aziz> @ThornJay Uh, he aint the only one in comics. You gotta elaborate sadly pickyPalm
[4:04:56] <Aussie_Manny> 35/35!
[4:04:57] <%dds333a> either that, or close
[4:04:57] <Aussie_Manny> GG!
[4:05:13] <+condemned_15> someone talk about kwanzaa?>
[4:05:20] <Aussie_Manny> So that's really everything?
[4:05:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> seriosuly Wall Bounding, especially after teh Wall Rocket upgrade, Venom Jump, and Swing Kicks are the best friends for cleaning up and picking people off to avoid getting overwhelmed
[4:05:25] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay YES
[4:05:40] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer Recently read ''Spider-Men'' where 616 Peter goes to the 1016 universe and it was pretty interesting to see them interact, also really heart warming to see Peter meet up with May after... well, after what happens to him in that universe
[4:05:40] <+StarPhoenix108> new collectible unlocked
[4:05:50] <Aussie_Manny> Unc would dig this suit. I bet he's a Daft Punk fan.
[4:05:51] <leith_aziz> Anyway, it's nice that Miles got a lowup after Spider-Verse
[4:05:54] <ThornJay> @nirefuster weaker physically, less experience
[4:06:01] <+darkco3d> Dope jacket
[4:06:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Heavy and guys with armor are less problematic when you have the Wall Rocket because it's automatically Venom even if you don't have Venom Meter
[4:06:06] <reonome> says the prowler
[4:06:06] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:06:06] <leith_aziz> Seems like he's in a good direction pickyCozy
[4:06:07] <Aussie_Manny> Does this suit work in cutscenes? I think so.
[4:06:09] <NireFuster> Oh shit, Prowler, is he evil in this or..?
[4:06:12] <VincentGraves> yo that suit
[4:06:17] <leith_aziz> *glowup
[4:06:17] <+StarPhoenix108> @NireFuster yes
[4:06:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Teach him the Hey move!
[4:06:22] <%ZweihanderSteve> LMAO
[4:06:23] <Dakuu75> dude that suit makes Miles look like SUCH an ass hole lol
[4:06:23] <leith_aziz> cohhPog
[4:06:23] <glass_marcus> Evil or not, he's got good advice
[4:06:24] <reonome> aw shit

[4:06:43] <%RyTYoung> YEYEYEYE
[4:06:44] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster That happened LOOOOONg ago. Miles is now part of the main universe, and the only thing left of the ultimate universe are Miles and a new villain named "Ultimatum" who uses stuff from the ultimate universe. Miles got completly reset in 2015 when they made him main-universe canon

[4:06:56] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster He is physically not as strong but that is more due to his age and his body not being as durable
[4:06:56] <+dekkitout> You know they were on that Sugar Hill craze
[4:06:57] <Aussie_Manny> omg the clean version sucks
[4:07:02] <%Ashenik1> is Spider Man MM better than vanila?
[4:07:07] <+Reverend_Roscoe> yo wait he knows aaron is prowler?!
[4:07:13] <enerkaizer> Rob Liefeld enters the chat

[4:07:25] <+condemned_15> evry ting gonna be ivry
[4:07:25] <+Reverend_Roscoe> fuck i missed it!
[4:07:27] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Spider-Men II is also neat
[4:07:29] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer Yeah I remember reading that there was a whole earth clashing thing where both universes get combined, super weird to me but I guess that's just comic book stuff? In any case, I love that Miles and Peter co-exist now, I don't like the idea of Miles ''replacing'' Peter
[4:07:32] <leith_aziz> @Ashenik1 Combat is more fun, but the story of the main game is deffinitely stronger
[4:07:33] <+Reverend_Roscoe> this is great!
[4:07:35] <Djinnazz> @Reverend_Roscoe he showed him as soon as they meet.
[4:07:38] <Aussie_Manny> BING BONG
[4:07:40] <Aussie_Manny> FUCK YA LIFE
[4:07:41] <Tonicky > just beat this game. it is pretty dang good
[4:07:46] <Dante_Namikaze1> @shad0wtag Spdier-Men 2 was bad
[4:07:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This here is Miles he's a prowler too. Hes a member of the Prowler crew
[4:08:09] <ThornJay> reminder that ultimate human torch and spidey have such a strong bromance that torch immediately starts banging female peter parker when she shows up
[4:08:10] <Aussie_Manny> Sounds like some kinda gong?
[4:08:15] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster I wouldn't mind it if they give peter a decent send off. allowing universes to grow and letting the characters age is what comics should do so they don't get stuck in this nonsense loop they#re in right now.
[4:08:18] <NireFuster> @ThornJay WHAT
[4:08:19] <%Shad0wTag> @Dante_Namikaze1 I thought it was OK. What made you disliked it?
[4:08:23] <QueequegTheater> It's also the wrong song
[4:08:23] <%MajorCrasher> look around
[4:08:36] <Dakuu75> I don't get it
[4:08:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Ashenik1 Think of MM like an Expansion Pack, it's much shorter but standalone but you should play them together (and the Ultimate Edition makes sure you get them both anyway)
[4:08:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[4:08:45] <Aussie_Manny> So we're Baby Driver-ing some tunes.
[4:08:48] <dadeaner> uh oh

[4:08:54] <%JetpackMcQuack> bing bong
[4:08:56] <%strakillias> Yo this kinda sucks
[4:08:59] <+FuqBoiSlim> @thornjay that plotline is so fcking crazy man I forgot that
[4:09:00] <+StarPhoenix108> looking the wrong way
[4:09:01] <Dante_Namikaze1> @shad0wtag Bendis's lack of effort compared to the first one and the whole secret behind 616 Miles
[4:09:05] <+dekkitout> @ThornJay He never got to kiss the homie, so he had to make do
[4:09:05] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer That's why I advocate so much for isolated stories and limited issue comics, I like the idea of Peter settling down, especially if he's acting as a parent and mentor in the case of May Parker
[4:09:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> we might be here a bit
[4:09:09] <Aussie_Manny> Couldn't be a seagull. lol
[4:09:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Definitely know the answer and I know what Woolie isn't aiming for
[4:09:13] <QueequegTheater> It's just straight up the wrong sound
[4:09:21] <%Shad0wTag> @ThornJay Yes she was. Came outta the ultimate clone saga
[4:09:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[4:09:30] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> The music producer in me loved this mission. <3
[4:09:30] <reonome> waveforms gotta match
[4:09:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> obviously the waveform not matching is a clue
[4:09:41] <+condemned_15> just match the waveform
[4:09:42] <+StarPhoenix108> behind you
[4:09:42] <%Shad0wTag> @NireFuster Did you not read Spider-Man Life Story by any chance? Its exactly what you want
[4:09:44] <+kewlmyc> The waveforms have to match up yeah. That's the biggest clue
[4:09:47] <%dds333a> you ain't a true friend if female you wouldnt give it up to the homies
[4:09:49] <QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[4:09:50] <+Prism_Zet> lol wollie overdoing it again
[4:09:52] <Aussie_Manny> Nah, doesn't sound like waves hitting, I don't think.
[4:10:03] <+taggerung403> aunt may's house of superheroes was the one of the only good things to come out of ultimatum
[4:10:04] <Aussie_Manny> Boat hitting?
[4:10:04] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster isolated stories would just kill the medium. It would end with really nothing mattering anymore. instead they should just let characters age and move on from there. embracing history and legacy is how real epics can be created.
[4:10:06] <NireFuster> @ThornJay Oh god, not clones again NotLikeThis
[4:10:06] <+dekkitout> @NireFuster Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows
[4:10:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I can tell you that they are aimed the wrong direction
[4:10:11] <%Shad0wTag> @Dante_Namikaze1 I will give you that, Bendis phoned it so he could go to DC and write the worst Superman in decades
[4:10:17] <leith_aziz> @ThornJay I dont know wether to respond with: "ewwwww pickyCringe " or "Whoa!  cohhO "

[4:12:06] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer To be fair, I'm not too well versed on how comic books work and what's best for them, I just have criticisms from the outside as someone that finds them tedious and frustrating sometimes, so long time comic readers definitely know better than me

[4:17:49] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag not expected, Timw as always written as bi. Multiple authors and artists have confirmed that
[4:18:00] <NireFuster> @andrewofbob Considering all the other apartments Peter gets during his life, I'd say yeah

[4:18:07] <ThornJay> @shad0wtag i remember right before tim was revealed as bi he got extremely pretty in his art.
[4:18:09] <Aussie_Manny> What of Miles? Is he DMCA-free? Is he safe?
[4:18:14] <%Shad0wTag> @enerkaizer Absolutely, I do wonder if they'll say Connor was bi too
[4:18:25] <+thesw1tch> @andrewofbob it's insane lol. i know someone who paid $500 to live in someones literal closet

[4:20:25] <enerkaizer> @Shad0wTag I'm still shocked they have never tried to pair conner up with M'Gan like in young justice, considering how popular that pairing is
[4:20:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Off the Wall is the best answer
[4:20:28] <+samuraiknack> So anyone read any decent comics recently? I got X-Men Grand Design sitting on the shelf so i'm gonna read that and also try to Morrisons Batman run

[4:23:35] <%funya_rinpa> Oh yeah, this game would be a bitrate obliterator
[4:23:35] <Dakuu75> @NireFuster one dude probably has a bullet lodged in his monitor
[4:23:41] <enerkaizer> @dekkitout the sad part is I really liked the idea behind the arkham knight from the comics. Her story was interesting, but no author picked up on that. It just feels like a gigantic waste
[4:23:42] <Aussie_Manny> NY makes their light posts strong.
[4:24:24] <coreybom> @thornjay Future state is too batman. One is a grizzled old bruce, the other the son i believe of lucias fox.

[4:28:47] <brothbowl> I think miles and kiryu would b good buds....
[4:28:50] <enerkaizer> reminder: JJJ actually managed once to enrage peter so much that Peter allmost punched his head off. If robbie wouldn't have stepped in he would've done it. It just took him 10 years in universe to get Peter to that point
[4:28:51] <fluke_LKZ> He's armored up
[4:28:52] <+Jiggisnipe> he's wearing armor. it's fine
[4:28:57] <+call_me_comic> much like FFX assume everyone in the marvel universe is actually stronger than average despite also having spiderman
[4:29:00] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, backing down is perfectly JJJ style.

[4:29:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, were you really expecting JJJ to actually debate a young woman of a color???
[4:29:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you're a New Yorker, it's OBVIUOUS
[4:29:20] <Aussie_Manny> Some kind of... rumbling?
[4:29:29] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer Literally like last night I read Peter Parker Spectacular Spiderman where Peter reveals his identity to JJ and they have like, an actual heart to heart and it's incredible
[4:29:29] <civilized_worm12> is there a dinosaur near by?
[4:29:33] <ThornJay> @birddotexe i feel like danikas just kinda boring, like she doesn't really have any flaws or significant personality traits, shes just "reasonable young podcaster with normal opinions"
[4:29:34] <%Juriasu> spiderman i jaywalking

[4:29:44] <Aussie_Manny> today i leanred

[4:29:50] <Aussie_Manny> today i learned*
[4:29:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's teh most obvious answer in the world
[4:30:01] <%dds333a> whatboutism
[4:30:02] <Aussie_Manny> Train tracks. Easy.
[4:30:07] <brandonmani456> I had trouble with these when I played it.
[4:30:11] <kulmoth> record?
[4:30:12] <Awesome_Leaf> npc be like GivePLZ
[4:30:12] <ThornJay> reminder that after peter reveals his identity in civil war jj decides to sue him for millions of dollars
[4:30:15] <Aussie_Manny> Wait, it's not the train?
[4:30:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Video games ALSO hurt the environment!!!"
[4:30:18] <+condemned_15> you didnt record
[4:30:25] <QueequegTheater> Whataboutism
[4:30:35] <civilized_worm12> too co cay
[4:30:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's actually Strawmanism
[4:30:45] <NireFuster> @ThornJay Yeah in the story I mentioned he also reprimands Peter about fraud LUL to be fair, JJ never said the pics couldn't come from Spiderman himself
[4:30:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> it's fun
[4:30:49] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster That story I talked about happened over 20 years ago and happened right after Peter and MJ got married. The look on JJJs face when he saw Peter lifting up robbie due to his spider-strength and allmost pissing himself was legendary
[4:30:50] <JacknZack27> I think the train has to actually be passing by to record
[4:30:54] <yukichocomilk> calling out usually doesn't do anything unfortunately
[4:30:57] <%dds333a> @nirefuster yeah, on the balcony right?
[4:30:58] <QueequegTheater> It's spelled "tu quoque", for the curious
[4:31:03] <QueequegTheater> It's Latin
[4:31:09] <majindusto> Wait...Where did he get the Daft Punk Spider-man suit?
[4:31:14] <+theoldone001> Basically everything Ben Shapiro does, while debating college students who don't know how to debate.
[4:31:19] <jorniev> ok but what if they control if you get put in jail ?
[4:31:19] <%imthewisejanitor> @QueequegTheater Thank you, I felt like an idiot trying to spell that wrong.
[4:31:20] <Arqartur0> @yukichocomilk unless it's ghosts

[4:31:54] <ThornJay> its not a coincidence that the big alt right grifters get their fame of off debating children
[4:32:13] <NireFuster> @dds333a Yes, and the funniest part is that JJ told everyone that he'd interview Spiderman so the FBI was there when Peter revealed his identity LUL luckily they didn't hear or see him, but Peter still got arrested

[4:33:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> its almost like emotions mean more than facts
[4:33:14] <Fauna_NE> bad apples for sure
[4:33:16] <%DashXero> Eh, debates are kinda useless if everyone's full of shit.
[4:33:32] <%Prevot> @DashXero so they're always useless?
[4:33:34] <%DashXero> And everyone's full of shit.
[4:33:38] <%mr_sups> I want to hear JJ's THought cabinet
[4:33:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> It's more about self-defense
[4:33:44] <%DashXero> ESPECIALLY me.
[4:33:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @DashXero in which case, it's usually a distraction for the masses
[4:33:49] <Aussie_Manny> What's the sample this time? Cars? Construction?
[4:33:51] <ThornJay> debates are a terrible format for actually having a thoughtful discussion
[4:33:58] <zanzibarian_hamster> JJJs thought cabinet is just halflight
[4:34:07] <Aussie_Manny> Ohh, an icicle melting?
[4:34:13] <alroy909> most people who go out of their way to listen to debates probably already believe in one side and will not be convinced anyway...
[4:34:14] <Arqartur0> @WoolieVersus There was a Greek Philosopher named Gorgias that debated people "on non-existance"

[4:34:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck the hat

[4:35:13] <+FennecZephyr> And no I will not change my mind
[4:35:14] <Djinnazz> he said he was a thief

[4:35:18] <NireFuster> @FennecZephyr >:(
[4:35:28] <QueequegTheater> @Dharvy3o5 It's entirely confrontational; you have to defeat the other side, there's no room for compromise.
[4:35:29] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:35:29] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster you only know half of it. Look up "Spider-Man punching his own dad" to see how insane that story became at the end

[4:41:23] <+supersweettreat> depends which eye you the drop one one eye means you took a life and the other eye means you lost a someone
[4:41:32] <%DashXero> A face tattoo that says sweet boy and a list of victims 50 men deep. People would learn.
[4:41:32] <penitentpendant> "Come get a taste of this sweetness!"
[4:41:37] <QueequegTheater> Woolie would last like two minutes longer than Reggie
[4:41:44] <Aussie_Manny> fuckin' new yorkers, man

[4:41:59] <NireFuster> Oh yeah I love that!
[4:42:11] <Aussie_Manny> Cloud is not a very social creature. doodSick
[4:42:11] <ThornJay> @nirefuster i just remember the concept of him getting absolutely demolished and then getting back up for seconds later felt so "Spiderman" to kid me
[4:42:15] <NireFuster> It's super good, there's like a bunch of dialogue boxes just appearing everywhere as you walk around, it's incredible
[4:42:23] <@Menitta> Mass Effect 3 does that but it's kinda weird
[4:42:27] <DXLelouch24> Ghost of Tsushima did it too
[4:42:28] <+theoldone001> Then you walk down a street and everyone is talking all at once lol
[4:42:31] <QueequegTheater> Yakuza has done that for like 10 years
[4:42:39] <OblivionSword1> the Yakuza series has that
[4:42:39] <+dekkitout> Milly pls, Venom is next game SeriousSloth
[4:42:42] <fluke_LKZ> ME YOU DOG
[4:42:47] <NireFuster> @ThornJay I mean yeah that's Spiderman to the core, he's never gonna stop coming back up even if he physically can't he always finds a way
[4:42:55] <Pookiedaexzile> "Cilent"
[4:42:56] <jorniev> Yakuza did that
[4:42:59] <yukichocomilk> problem is you need voice acting for all of that
[4:43:05] <Aussie_Manny> Oh shit.
[4:43:12] <%dds333a> I want to just talk to EVERYONE though, and everybody having no problem talking LUL
[4:43:13] <OblivionSword1> Yakuza did that since Yakuza 3 I think
[4:43:14] <QueequegTheater> FUCK, that one took me like 25 minutes
[4:43:25] <SaiyanShoto> Just walking in FF7 then you hear “and they were roommates!”
[4:43:26] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, man. Dad was disappoint.
[4:43:26] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster not always. have you read how spidey dealt with venom originally in the comics?
[4:43:51] <GHouseduivel> Yeah, well, fuck you, Terrance Howard.
[4:43:52] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:43:53] <QueequegTheater> @SaiyanShoto "Did you hear? Tifa's running for Senate!"
[4:44:08] <ThornJay> Terrence "Don Cheadle" Howard
[4:44:15] <SaiyanShoto> @queequegtheater LUL LUL LUL
[4:44:18] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer Uhh not really, I'm pretty out of the loop when it comes to the very OG spiderman comics
[4:44:23] <%dds333a> @queequegtheater what's her platform Kappa
[4:44:29] <GHouseduivel> @QueequegTheater I can't believe the Prime Minister of Italy shared their porn on the floor. Kappa

[4:44:57] <+condemned_15> look somewhere else
[4:45:00] <%DashXero> Cross walk indicator?
[4:45:03] <Aussie_Manny> Silent Hill monster coming
[4:45:12] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster Peter just went "Okay, you have your turf, I have mine. If you stay out of mine I stay out of yours!". The first person to beat venom in a 1 on 1 fight was actually Ben Reilly, AKA the Scarlet-Spider/ the second Spider-Man
[4:45:22] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, duh. Belltower.
[4:45:24] <ThornJay> we STAN the italian senate for their good taste tbh
[4:45:29] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Would love to see terrance howard make a one-off Iron Mayne reference.
[4:45:31] <slackerunchained> Take Me to Church!
[4:45:31] <%RyTYoung> Woolie will figure it out woolieMIRIN
[4:45:42] <Aussie_Manny> I remember that place! That's where Topher Grace became Venom! Kappa
[4:45:48] <+dekkitout> @enerkaizer And that's how Venom became the Lethal Protector, defender of peace, eater of brains, esquire
[4:45:52] <enerkaizer> Is that supposed to be the "Lady of sorrows"-church?
[4:45:56] <@Menitta> Aerodynamic

[4:46:06] <enerkaizer> @dekkitout Nope, that happened WAAAAY later
[4:46:08] <NireFuster> @enerkaizer To be fair, isn't Venom kind of... a goofball in the comics? I remember that Venom doesn't immediately turn into just a crazy murderer and he's more of just doing his own thing, right?
[4:46:09] <+condemned_15> you just got DMCA'd
[4:46:11] <QueequegTheater> Oh man the nostalgia is hitting

[4:46:41] <ghoulspan> does this game makes you FEEL like spiderman?
[4:46:42] <SaiyanShoto> Man that Tifa animation is really good. The Italian government has good taste
[4:46:43] <@Menitta> I got into Daft Punk in 2019....so yes
[4:46:44] <enerkaizer> @NireFuster Not at that time. Venom was absolutly deadly, and peter couzldn't beat him. he still is one of Peters mightiest and deadliest foes he ever faced
[4:46:44] <Aussie_Manny> fuck yeah!

[4:47:23] <enerkaizer> @ThornJay Ben is currently "The" Spider-Man, and he is more or less going though a blade-runner style story were the corporation he works for is rewritting memories
[4:47:24] <Djinnazz> @Krasmeyts his brother?
[4:47:26] <leomuratore> But is it really, though?
[4:47:28] <Aussie_Manny> Is recording a busker cheating? I'd think so.
[4:47:29] <ThornJay> @enerkaizer is it comic canon that he is immune to spidey sense?
[4:47:33] <SaiyanShoto> He’s gonna take this mixtape you’re making and go sell it LUL LUL
[4:47:33] <QueequegTheater> Pretty sure the Rolling Stones did that with the sitar in paint It Black long before Wu Tang
[4:47:34] <xxshadowxx416> street lights

[4:48:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> if you sample a busker you better give em a big tip
[4:48:11] <%RyTYoung> Is this copyright claiming someone else’s beat? woolieSHOOKREG
[4:48:14] <HawkGoggles2> I could eat
[4:48:15] <Aussie_Manny> I could go for some good food truck food.
[4:48:19] <@Menitta> fuck it I'm going to get a pretzel
[4:48:19] <Aussie_Manny> REGGIE GETS IT
[4:48:20] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> "Yo spiderman stole my beat!"
[4:48:35] <enerkaizer> @ThornJay yes. because the symbiote was a part of peter his body doesn't register him as a threat, meaning his spider-sense is useless against him. Only Bens spider-sense works because he never did bound himself to the venom symbiote
[4:48:38] <@Menitta> food trucks are great because they gotta be weird and different
[4:48:40] <penitentpendant> Mafia says "Nah"
[4:48:44] <QueequegTheater> I'm going to Burger King
[4:48:45] <Aussie_Manny> Wait, Montreal is against food trucks?? D:
[4:48:45] <+condemned_15> phrasing
[4:48:46] <%Pillagius> Meat was "Solid" ?
[4:48:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am currently stuck in Ohio and I MISS Street Food in NYC and NJ so bad
[4:48:56] <%RyTYoung> @professor_dr_muffins literally the first thing I thought when I played this myself LUL
[4:48:58] <leomuratore> Are there no food trucks in Montreral?!
[4:49:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there some here but not enough
[4:49:03] <NireFuster> Food truck food is incredible, everytime I go to the city and eat at mcdonalds or bk it's so underwhelming compared to just a regular food truck burger
[4:49:04] <ThornJay> seeing a guy sneeze into his hand and keep cooking seconds after I bought food has killed my ability to eat street food
[4:49:06] <+condemned_15> WU TANG

[5:07:29] <Make_me_mad> @QueequegTheater Rhino escaped from the convoy at the start, the whole chase was highly televised, it ended at a Roxxon facility with Rhino knocked out, and then they just... don't get Rhino back to send him to the raft?

[5:08:58] <Make_me_mad> @QueequegTheater Them bribing a few people to look the other way doesn't explain away an empty supervillain cell on the raft. At the very least everyone running that jail is in on this, as well as anyone in charge of the transfer.

[5:23:52] <%OrangeMDT> Gosh, why do writers make these kinds of characters
[5:23:55] <%dds333a> LUL
[5:24:18] <ThornJay> i think its the only weak part about these games writing when some female characters dont get called out on their shit for some reason
[5:24:21] <+vaderxyz1970> Gaslighting Hermione
[5:24:30] <LeeOhX> that body electricity is kinda distracting
[5:24:33] <Moondoggie25> I forgot how close this stuff is to the batman games
[5:24:37] <Aussie_Manny> Miles do be prowlin'.
[5:24:46] <Dakuu75> it's like that chick from Invincible. she was awful too
[5:24:49] <mighty_fine_trousers> it's a bug
[5:24:51] <%Prevot> @OrangeMDT said writers are probably pretty similar to those characters
[5:24:54] <+vaderxyz1970> @thornjay I guess the fear is being seen as sexist?

[5:25:29] <Dr_Mooose> stop being a terrorist!
[5:25:30] <%qonfiguration> she didn't think this through

[5:25:34] <%imthewisejanitor> "Miles, try and remember the basics of CQC."
[5:25:36] <ThornJay> like im supposed to sympathise with phin but she fucking sucks, im supposed to love mj but shes kinda shitty to pete, im supposed to like silver sable but shes explicitly a piece of shit that holds internment camps. and none of these things ever really get called out.
[5:25:38] <GHouseduivel> Let me destroy an entire block. :)
[5:25:43] <+Rafraud> Known crime committer mad about being told to not do crimes

[5:25:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> The quips never stop
[5:26:08] <Dakuu75> Phin is thirsty for terrorism
[5:26:10] <maskeddudej> its 100% life proof
[5:26:25] <Aussie_Manny> gg
[5:26:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Amirifiz yeah... totally not wrongabout that... totally not going to be wrongabout something
[5:26:37] <Aussie_Manny> What's with the electricity?
[5:26:37] <+Damie904> @willyfreshness Sarcasm aside, blowing up a nuclear reactor in the middle of Manhattan and acting like no one could possibly be hurt besides the corp is fucking stupid.
[5:26:49] <%qonfiguration> Cloud Strife moment
[5:26:49] <%dds333a> @thornjay I don't think the game actually tries to justify Sable
[5:26:50] <coreybom> Phin, you are working with a group that are hardnen and unsympathetic criminals, and is pretty much going for pure terrorism in a city that suffered one of the notorious examples of it.
[5:26:54] <QueequegTheater> @Aussie_Manny nuke

[5:27:43] <Aussie_Manny> The suit's definitely bugged.
[5:27:45] <QueequegTheater> I think it's a bug

[5:28:37] <%jinking79> Rhino One More Day
[5:28:37] <ThornJay> @dds333a they pretty much ignore it and handwave away her just leaving her people to keep doing it, despite owning sable she has no control apparently. Also they try to make her and peters relationship charming and quippy but im too distracted by how shitty of a person she is.
[5:28:40] <penitentpendant> Fight the Corporate Super Villain~

[5:29:16] <BlackermanZX> Rhino Bane lets gooo
[5:29:19] <Aussie_Manny> The tanks must be super tough.
[5:29:25] <Amirifiz> @shinobiphoenix Oh, then you know it was gonna be fine until the changes that made it not fine.
[5:29:30] <stevenellis386> GEEZE
[5:29:30] <%dds333a> @thornjay right, and I don't think the game makes excuses for that. it may not give it the gravitas or attention it deserves, but it doesn't try to justify it
[5:29:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Rhino would beat the shit out of Bane
[5:29:36] <%RyTYoung> This is the best part of the game imo
