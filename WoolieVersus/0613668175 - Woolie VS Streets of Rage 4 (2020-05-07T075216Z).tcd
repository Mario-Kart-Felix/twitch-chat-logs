[0:03:32] <%DatAsuna> Personally for me it hits the fun dumb
[0:03:40] <+egalitarian696969> minh is the 1 of 6
[0:03:44] <%Chatterbox1991> is it meant to be explicit pro-life propaganda or is it just raw dumb?
[0:03:44] <%optimasmaximas> she went INSIDE NAOTHER woman
[0:03:46] <AndrewsLovesPizza> is that a burnout 3 shirt?
[0:03:46] <%DatAsuna> the worst comics can only be taken seriously
[0:03:48] <evilaltruistic> As a lover of dumb shit. that page is just gross.
[0:03:51] <waterstealer> other shit i've seen is way dumber and people defend that, why is this page in particular so bad?
[0:03:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Third Birthday, DMC 2... Naruto... Yeah I can see it Minh.
[0:04:04] <+mighty_max_t> Exactly
[0:04:05] <$JobbedBone> what are we talking about? give me the term to google
[0:04:07] <%DatAsuna> Big disagree

[0:04:12] <waterstealer> yeah
[0:04:22] <%DatAsuna> Some things are obnoxiously desperate to let you know they know and it ruins the fun dumb
[0:04:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> NO, you HAVE to play it straight.
[0:04:27] <waterstealer> people defend fucking last of us 2
[0:04:33] <waterstealer> how is this any worse
[0:04:34] <gekizenbu> @jobbedbone check the subreddit you'll find it

[0:04:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Mille just tried to do offensive shit to offend people
[0:04:41] <%doomerskeletor13> *millar
[0:04:41] <%DatAsuna> Conversely, almost every movie in the 80s having no idea how dumb or homo erotic they are is what makes them funny
[0:04:47] <%NocturnGamma> What comic was it from?
[0:04:57] <evilaltruistic> That's the thing with Comic books. at some point you are out of original ideas so you just turn to something weird and stupid.
[0:04:58] <%DatAsuna> E.g. look at everything trading on 80s nostalgia that tries to let you know it knows
[0:04:58] <%doomerskeletor13> The Magic Order by Mark Millar
[0:05:02] <transporterthesequel> Minh be honest you unironically like Demon I can feel it
[0:05:11] <%DatAsuna> And thus failing to actually get that 80s appeal in the process

[0:13:07] <%LordSDB> My fear of this evo, is not only that it's online, but the possible lag switching and sudden internet crashes, that might not be able to be proven.
[0:13:12] <%Chatterbox1991> technically I believe Philippinos should get the N pass because they got called that a lot in the Spanish American War
[0:13:14] <r_hoque92> THE FGC MUST DIE TO SAVE ITSELF

[0:19:44] <%optimasmaximas> ooh thats good
[0:19:46] <%RioGascar> the fact all the legalizee got involved is why i used jimmy as a donation. he fits super well
[0:19:50] <andrei11dr> Pat didn't engage until you were 5 minutes in so i call bullshit
[0:19:51] <gekizenbu> we're not in the sugar canes @masterpiecejeremy this is the cotton fields
[0:20:05] <%NocturnGamma> Walt and Jesse. Walt's is more selfish
[0:20:07] <%Exiliator> true woolieSHOOK
[0:20:12] <%doomerskeletor13> I say Walt and Jesse
[0:20:13] <%hamahiroyuki> Woolie Madden's N-word™
[0:20:14] <+GrumbleGrouse> Walter White is way more manipulative
[0:20:15] <+pyrojack6> Jesse straight up tells walter to fuck himself
[0:20:16] <%Jetzord> Walt is way worse
[0:20:17] <TalisKanju> Stream over?
[0:20:17] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Walter basically uses Jessie as a human sponge to soak up all the problems that come his way
[0:20:18] <phatmac16> Walt and Jessie?
[0:20:20] <%emperordread> It was a Grade-A bit Woolie, glad Pat made it run :)
[0:20:23] <%Jbulleit97> Mario and Luigi
[0:20:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Walt is super manipulative
[0:20:30] <+jjolion> Naruto didn't kill Sasuke's girlfriend
[0:20:31] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[0:20:31] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 31 minutes and 54 seconds
[0:20:31] <thesickestzak> HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
[0:20:41] <+HotBloodedHero> I say Naruto and Sasuke cuz that relationship isn't over yet.
[0:20:42] <%RioGascar> I think walter and jesse cause they go back and forth so often
[0:20:42] <%sporeian94> I've never seen Naruto but did Naruto watch Sasuke's GF die and willing not stop it?
[0:20:48] <+pyrojack6> "I'm Quitting You"
[0:20:51] <Zebroneath> Walter literally lets Jesse's gf die to keep him in
[0:20:54] <+michingmallecho> Head taps save the soul psaSmug
[0:20:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Also there’s a power imbalance between Walt and Jesse because Walt is a mentor figure
[0:21:11] <shinjoshua> does that make it better or worse?
[0:21:11] <devil_may_cum_> @zebroneath THIS you can’t top that
[0:21:13] <rubbishbinge> If you count Boruto they're relationship is pretty ok
[0:21:14] <BoneBagMel> woolieMIRIN_TK
[0:21:18] <rubbishbinge> their*
[0:21:20] <%RioGascar> So much so he almost NEVER calls him anything BUT MR. WHITE
[0:21:29] <thesickestzak> Doesn't Walt also kill that kid with drugs too because of Jesse?
[0:21:32] <%RioGascar> i watchd the whole series again and paid attention
[0:21:35] <%TimetodiveLTX> like pitbulls
[0:21:44] <%RioGascar> he always refers to walter as “mr.white”
[0:21:44] <%TimetodiveLTX> p word
[0:21:53] <andrei11dr> Breaking Bad had better writing therefore the relationship between caracters matterd all the way true
[0:21:56] <%kyh9> Jesse and Walter actually had a relationship
[0:21:58] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> vomit scene
[0:22:02] <+Ether101_Prime> Boruto's so much better then Naruto at the end.
[0:22:03] <+karldeck> 15 Years
[0:22:11] <+RJay80> The sharingan is basically Super Sayain
[0:22:15] <%RioGascar> jesse and walt also had “good” moments
[0:22:17] <+mighty_max_t> Started in 96 or 99, i think
[0:22:21] <+zanzibar_junker> boruto ended?
[0:22:40] <alexandrecau> Naruto is not breaking bad, Woolie with the hard truth
[0:22:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:22:41] <andrei11dr> Also Walter and Jessie talked way more than Naruto and Sasuke ever did
[0:22:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Mike could see how Walt had Jesse wrapped around his finger, which is why he wanted him to just leave town
[0:22:47] <+karldeck> Naruto ran for 15 Years
[0:22:54] <Belutima> alright I am out for 5 min, woolie give signal or something when you done abbaWave
[0:22:57] <+karldeck> Also dead girlfriend
[0:22:57] <alexandrecau> Mike was shikamaru
[0:23:01] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[0:23:14] <+karldeck> Girlfriends
[0:23:16] <%hamahiroyuki> breaking bad spoilers are worth more to avoid
[0:23:19] <Camail> naruto cant get as dark
[0:23:22] <%DatAsuna> IF ONLY he let sakura choke on her own vomit
[0:23:26] <%doomerskeletor13> He actually causes it by sitting on the bed and then does nothing
[0:23:36] <andrei11dr> And just fucking off ,because it was " bad for the operation"
[0:23:41] <+jetjagger222> !uptime
[0:23:42] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 35 minutes and 4 seconds
[0:23:52] <%RioGascar> He causes is by trying to wake jesse up from his heroin use
[0:23:53] <+MASTODONSENTRY> @karldeck i thought the other girl was all the blond hair guys fault not walts?
[0:23:53] <+TopTieramisu> he can't keep getting away with it
[0:23:53] <+Ether101_Prime> What about Big Macky's relationship with everyone?
[0:23:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Walt POISONED A CHILD just to manipulate Jesse
[0:23:59] <alexandrecau> ehhhh
[0:24:10] <+GrumbleGrouse> lily of the valley
[0:24:25] <TerryBrogard> Which in turn caused the girls dad to freak out and cause a giant plane accident. Dont forget that
[0:24:35] <Dova573> yeah like i get if naruto sasukes relationship is not healthy but saying its any near walter and jessies is kinda dumb
[0:24:42] <andrei11dr> Walter is straight up a hardcore drug lord by the end
[0:24:42] <+TopTieramisu> comparing naruto to breaking bad is like comparing my middle school recorder performance to beethoven
[0:24:48] <+karldeck> @MASTODONSENTRY Yes, but all thanks to Walt keeping it going
[0:24:56] <NevikGamina> if Iruka sensei got Chidori'ed LUL
[0:24:56] <%Lion_kun> Blaming Walter for that airplane crash is dumb
[0:24:58] <+NWannabe> Ey, they starrted SOR4 yet?
[0:25:02] <+MASTODONSENTRY> @karldeck right right right
[0:25:02] <%RioGascar> hell gus and jesse WERE ABOUT TO JUST WORK IT ALL OUT
[0:25:08] <+NWannabe> They need a 3rd?
[0:25:09] <%generalve> YES SHE IS
[0:25:14] <%paladinstarbuster> Sasuke and Naruto were at least real friends at some point. Sasuke was willing to DIE for naruto. Walter Never would do that for jessie.
[0:25:18] <%RioGascar> like jesse saved gus’s ass in mexico
[0:25:18] <%Exiliator> tiny shukaku
[0:25:20] <%TimetodiveLTX> like comparing RWBY to Toy Story
[0:25:22] <alexandrecau> Gus would have not work it out
[0:25:23] <Who_lio42> that was filler and a toy
[0:25:25] <%Kriss1827> she is very cute
[0:25:30] <%Lion_kun> Id equally blame the airport that let that guy go back to work
[0:25:31] <TerryBrogard> @lion_kun Yeah I know. But it was a chain reaction
[0:25:32] <Aussie_Manny> Ak-at-SOO-key
[0:25:32] <%GalacticaPhanto> Himawari is legit adorable
[0:25:39] <%generalve> woolie they were imprisoned .........
[0:25:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I think that’s why I enjoy Better Call Saul more cause I just like Jimmy more
[0:25:46] <%Damie904> Shukaku never did anything Woolie. It was just SUPER TIRED of being sealed.
[0:25:47] <+Ether101_Prime> Garra's village deserved it.
[0:25:53] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Walt basically forced Jessie to murder Gale as well
[0:26:03] <%NocturnGamma> Anime filler
[0:26:03] <%RioGascar> gus and jesse maybe wouldnt work out fully. But jesse could do walts meth. but walts ego...just gets out of hand
[0:26:09] <%generalve> "humans are the real monsters" Kappa

[0:26:14] <%kyh9> "BUT IT WAS SAD THOUGH"
[0:26:19] <%jiggy_snipe> almost like they might have cool guys before people started bothering them
[0:26:20] <%paladinstarbuster> THEY WERENT MONSTERS they were being used as tools
[0:26:23] <+TopTieramisu> orochimaru did nothing wrong :)
[0:26:23] <Camail> you can forgive mass murderers just cuz
[0:26:25] <tokenreefer> whats worse though killing your friends or just being a sociopath?
[0:26:26] <Who_lio42> even Kurama became chill, basically
[0:26:30] <%Lion_kun> Tehy were only put in that situation because Jesse was gonna kill those 2 guys
[0:26:31] <%Damie904> Whoa whoa whoa. Why you calling him a horrible monster? He was a sentient being with hopes and dreams. He said whatever he had to in the hopes of getting out.
[0:26:31] <%generalve> What ?
[0:26:32] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, Saul and his brother.
[0:26:34] <waterstealer> genie?
[0:26:37] <waterstealer> his old wife?
[0:26:41] <%Exiliator> I have heard others say the same
[0:26:41] <alexandrecau> Ohb yes that's the worst
[0:26:43] <andrei11dr> Nobody's powers but Naruto and Sasuke matter by the time you get there
[0:26:45] <%RioGascar> oh man
[0:26:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:26:47] <+Dr_DangerPhD> That relationship is fucked, its so bad
[0:26:48] <%Lion_kun> Fuck Chuck
[0:26:49] <waterstealer> oh jimmy
[0:26:49] <%DatAsuna> IT'S SO GOOD
[0:26:50] <%RioGascar> Thats a hard one
[0:26:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Chuck was so manipulative man
[0:26:58] <+GrumbleGrouse> BCS got great this season
[0:26:59] <waterstealer> yeah that relationship is fucked
[0:26:59] <TerryBrogard> Better call Saul is amazing
[0:27:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> Bijou are friends
[0:27:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> whipV
[0:27:07] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s a very toxic relationship
[0:27:08] <%gatorafan> Formerly Sneed
[0:27:14] <alexandrecau> Chuck is an asshole but is right, Jimmy is decent but wrong
[0:27:16] <%RioGascar> better call saul > breaking bad
[0:27:21] <%jiggy_snipe> yakuza 7 coming to steam probably :O
[0:27:22] <@Menitta> Yakuza 5 has Virtua Fighter 2 with online play
[0:27:31] <thesickestzak> Cool
[0:27:31] <tokenreefer> so an anarchist and destroying everything you love is better than being a sociopath?
[0:27:34] <%jiggy_snipe> probably
[0:27:36] <%Daba_mk2> is coming to steam
[0:27:37] <Ghostbody> Both
[0:27:39] <Aussie_Manny> Yakuza: Like Dragon Quest.
[0:27:39] <%doomerskeletor13> @riogascar I agree actually! I just enjoy Jimmy more as a protagonist
[0:27:41] <%NocturnGamma> Overthinking lol
[0:27:41] <+johnny_gogo> no just Japanese name
[0:27:41] <%Daba_mk2> probably
[0:27:41] <%Lion_kun> YESSSES
[0:27:44] <@Menitta> Probably both
[0:27:46] <%Solidnick18> @jiggy_snipe it's on the steam listing thing
[0:27:48] <+HotBloodedHero> I can see it being both
[0:27:50] <andrei11dr> Probably
[0:27:51] <%Exiliator> Yeees-Nooo....Yes?
[0:27:52] <waterstealer> but the new guy loves dragon quest
[0:27:52] <Who_lio42> I wish the "like a dragon" font was in the same style as Dragon Quest logo
[0:27:53] <Torgue_1> Big brain thinking
[0:27:54] <+TheCrispyBoi> it's both
[0:27:57] <@Menitta> Well maybe. In Japan it's just Yakuza 7
[0:27:58] <gekizenbu> they literally namedrop dragon quest
[0:27:58] <thesickestzak> COR BLIMEY
[0:28:00] <tokenreefer> jessies gf lowkey deserved to die
[0:28:02] <@Menitta> er Ryu Ga Gotoku 7
[0:28:03] <%Solidnick18> It's Yakuza: like dragon quest
[0:28:03] <%Lion_kun> Woolie Judgment LP when
[0:28:06] <%doomerskeletor13> They’re both game number 7 too
[0:28:15] <Daxalog> What was phoenix Down?
[0:28:22] <Haarute> yakuza 0 lp when
[0:28:22] <%generalve> never
[0:28:23] <Aussie_Manny> Judgement? Naah
[0:28:24] <devil_may_cum_> @lewdskeletor13 Oh shit that’s true lol
[0:28:26] <waterstealer> GOOD DECISION
[0:28:30] <shinjoshua> woolie thats wrong
[0:28:31] <zamzoph> Start with PS2 Yakuza
[0:28:38] <%Exiliator> still say staring with 1 is better
[0:28:38] <+johnny_gogo> But wooolie
[0:28:42] <%sporeian94> Play Persona 1 on Ps1
[0:28:43] <%doomerskeletor13> For sure start with 0
[0:28:43] <%Irridium> I mean Judgement is its own separate thing so it'd be fine, honestly
[0:28:44] <%DatAsuna> Well that would break your usual start at the beginning rule
[0:28:44] <%NocturnGamma> Stagnate views yo
[0:28:44] <thesickestzak> Start with Fist of the North Star
[0:28:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> Or Dokapon
[0:28:46] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:28:47] <%Daba_mk2> lol
[0:28:47] <tokenreefer> jessie lowkey made the worst decisions
[0:28:49] <worldbrand> puzzlebois baba!!
[0:28:50] <%heartlesshealer> bloodsports
[0:28:51] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Zero is best starting point
[0:28:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> Nope LUL
[0:28:52] <waterstealer> probably??
[0:28:53] <Aussie_Manny> Too many games, gotta have a little of everything? HahaBall
[0:28:54] <%DatAsuna> The beginning would be 1 and go back to 0 later
[0:28:54] <%paladinstarbuster> maybe
[0:28:55] <%heartlesshealer> blood-e-sports
[0:28:55] <rubbishbinge> Start with Shenmue
[0:28:56] <%generalve> dokapon ALWAYS gets 1k views
[0:29:01] <%Exiliator> If someone hadnt watch any of the LotR movies, I wouldnt say start with hobbit
[0:29:02] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Judgment would be second best
[0:29:07] <andrei11dr> 0 is like 36 hours so that's a good choice
[0:29:08] <%Lion_kun> 0 is best starting point
[0:29:10] <Who_lio42> Zero is the worst starting point because its the best game
[0:29:10] <%Exiliator> ... actually maybe skip hobbit altogether
[0:29:11] <@Menitta> Don't start with 1 on PS2 lmao
[0:29:11] <%Solidnick18> Judgment is a spin off but like it starts off slow and starts to pick up
[0:29:15] <MoroseLoki> Persona 1? Thats a rough one.
[0:29:18] <%hamahiroyuki> but mainly salt
[0:29:22] <+johnny_gogo> Naruto is a good influence for the Dokapon LP
[0:29:22] <%DatAsuna> 0 is a good game but it makes 1 way worse when you go back
[0:29:25] <%gatorafan> But is it as abusive as Naruto and Sasuke? Kappa
[0:29:33] <%Solidnick18> 0 i'd watch cause i love it
[0:29:36] <%jinking79> all 10 games of Yakuza
[0:29:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Also Judgement has like 0 connections to the main games besides the setting
[0:29:39] <plushysceptile> As someone who's been playing SoR 4 since release, super good game
[0:29:39] <SHADIC7> happy to see the yakuza army growing
[0:29:40] <+Mkingston> My mum just walked into the room. Pointed at Woolie and said "That's trouble."
[0:29:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> Play 0 and nothing els

[0:29:45] <waterstealer> because they don't have the hatred in their hearts
[0:29:45] <andrei11dr> @moroseloki Not as rough as P2
[0:29:47] <thesickestzak> And cowardice
[0:29:48] <%heartlesshealer> OH REALLY MINH?

[0:30:06] <TomosukeUsagi> HeyGuys
[0:30:08] <+Mkingston> My mum just walked into the room. Pointed at Woolie and said "That's trouble. Written all over him."
[0:30:13] <%DatAsuna> Eternal Punishment > Innocent Sin
[0:30:14] <Aussie_Manny> NO CHILL D:
[0:30:20] <rubbishbinge> it's just a 3.5k prize jeez
[0:30:22] <%DatAsuna> Woolie you need to LP 3 yakuza games at once
[0:30:22] <%Exiliator> @DatAsuna EXACTLY!
[0:30:23] <%gatorafan> Not enough people have been brave enough to play it and see if your way is the norm
[0:30:23] <%chll0ne> @datasuna i agree
[0:30:24] <%nothuzad> the BEST game - according to woolie
[0:30:27] <%RioGascar> One thing im hoping we get is more boardgames after dokapon. I am sorta missing them
[0:30:32] <%DatAsuna> All 3 slots, play them in rotating order
[0:30:40] <@Menitta> Real question is when's Trauma Team

[0:32:10] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> Caution Dokapon may result in schizophrenia
[0:32:15] <@Menitta> @RioGascar Kinda but not really. Trauma Team has 6 playable characters with different gameplay modes and one of them is an autopsy.
[0:32:16] <tokenreefer> you gotta mix up the niche dokapon stuff with the newer eye catching stuff
[0:32:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Until that AT field cracks...
[0:32:20] <thesickestzak> Just don't do the wrong thing 4Head
[0:32:30] <@Menitta> One is also a diagnosis and the others are surgery
[0:32:36] <DXLelouch24> @nothuzad someone needs to just SHUT MINH DOWN COMPLETELY so progress is made, just shut him down and keep him there

[0:39:26] <Saltmeisterr> pat seemed to like sor4
[0:39:28] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @HowIPendragon there's a history. Woolie just putting it into perspective...
[0:39:28] <staticshock5> This music is so good
[0:39:28] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> this being now my favorite game of all time I'm biased
[0:39:29] <+solzan2000> the OST is popping as well
[0:39:35] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> but id say yeah it's alright
[0:39:43] <Who_lio42> pick up button is such a good addition
[0:39:44] <%Superblooms> isn't the main game only 2-players?
[0:39:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYE ALL 3 PLAING
[0:39:46] <%Daba_mk2> to be fair Go Straight is a fuking great song
[0:39:47] <andrei11dr> Shutouts to Samoan Cyborgs
[0:39:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> playing
[0:39:54] <thegraveyardduck> The music in level 2 is fucking amazing. Been listening to it a lot, specifically the track “Call the Cops”
[0:39:58] <%SomersaultJustice> enable star move R1
[0:40:00] <+TopTieramisu> samoan bionic command
[0:40:01] <Saltmeisterr> online is only 2p
[0:40:02] <+TopTieramisu> commando*
[0:40:04] <%nothuzad> Superblooms I think local supports up to 4
[0:40:06] <staticshock5> @superblooms Online it's 2. Local it's 4 players
[0:40:06] <+SaltySombrero> I'd not use egacy mode cuz you'd want to have a dedicated pickup button
[0:40:07] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Funky HQ is a pretty good early track as well
[0:40:08] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[0:40:10] <+TheDankDemon> it's SoR alright
[0:40:13] <Saltmeisterr> local is up to 4 players
[0:40:18] <Who_lio42> legacy mode doesnt let you use star moves??? interesting
[0:40:18] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> the video option for lower latency is so good
[0:40:26] <%gatorafan> Eyes unclouded one might say
[0:40:28] <Aussie_Manny> River City Girls.
[0:40:30] <+ChrisAlgoo> brawler boiz
[0:40:31] <%Superblooms> for battle mode it's 4. i don't think the story or arcade does 4 players.
[0:40:32] <%Jbulleit97> PIZZA and BURGERS!
[0:40:32] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you just get 16ms less latency
[0:40:32] <+Chazmosis> Brawl Brothers maybe?
[0:40:35] <@Menitta> All I know about SOR is how fuckin sick Go Straight is
[0:40:36] <TalisKanju> Brawl Brothers
[0:40:38] <%RioGascar> It probably does let you use star moves just beed to do inputs
[0:40:40] <+mighty_max_t> Spider-Man Maximum Carnage was my beat-em up

[0:44:10] <andrei11dr> LA sure looking rough
[0:44:19] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> it has an ambient lighting layer
[0:44:25] <+Dr_DangerPhD> your defensive special and forward/back throws have i frames
[0:44:27] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> its incredible
[0:44:34] <+LastHazzerd> Cherry? the punk rock dog from Animal Crossing?
[0:44:40] <thegraveyardduck> The lighting is surprisingly good on the characters at points
[0:44:42] <+SaltySombrero> Hit enemies to regain health after using Specials
[0:44:45] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus You can tech throws too
[0:44:45] <Saltmeisterr> and individual lighting effects on the sprites
[0:44:50] <Saltmeisterr> it looks so good

[0:45:05] <%SomersaultJustice> woo
[0:45:07] <thegraveyardduck> You can also catch thrown weapons in midair
[0:45:09] <Dave_VD> really excited to see this
[0:45:10] <+twohitgood> the controls in this game feel so good. cherry has a lot of freedom with combos.
[0:45:12] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> just let lizardcube make all your games sega

[0:45:28] <%Daba_mk2> Do combo yeah
[0:45:32] <+Ascethetic> @WoolieVersus Cherry has air grabs
[0:45:36] <agadejobi> Y-Signal back in action!
[0:45:37] <odd_slater> I wonder how people are feeling this compared to River City Girls
[0:45:38] <presque> Those moves look really cool
[0:45:51] <Sedrelic> this game looks good...unlike the takeover
[0:45:54] <BoneofMalkav> Cherry can run with a double tap of the direction
[0:45:57] <+TopTieramisu> i haven't played RCG but no one's complained about the ending for SOR4
[0:46:00] <+solzan2000> just cherry can run
[0:46:02] <%SomersaultJustice> only cherry can run
[0:46:02] <MayorRev> CHERRY IS FAST
[0:46:06] <+solzan2000> and adam can dash
[0:46:07] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Cherry can run/Adam has a quick step dash
[0:46:08] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> blazes back attack cancels her normal string, and you can cancel that into a charge to initiate a launch
[0:46:08] <%Jetzord> Man, when did Axel turn into a bear
[0:46:10] <TheAmazingClaytor> BOXING
[0:46:10] <+SilverDevilfish> Cherry is basically better Skate
[0:46:11] <staticshock5> Cherry is the only one who runs
[0:46:12] <+tigerfang86> woolie has DASH
[0:46:14] <Aussie_Manny> SUPLEX CITY BITCVH
[0:46:15] <Daxalog> Are you holding down the run on the second press?
[0:46:16] <MayorRev> Cherry is so fast
[0:46:16] <alexandrecau> too muscly to run
[0:46:17] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> but axel can wavedash
[0:46:18] <%astrophizz> Only Cherry can run for now
[0:46:20] <thegraveyardduck> Only Cherry can run
[0:46:20] <+ChrisAlgoo> Hunter family secret technique
[0:46:23] <+Chazmosis> Only three characters have movement options like that
[0:46:24] <%SomersaultJustice> I keep thinking axel is alex with a beard
[0:46:25] <+twohitgood> your jump controls feels like smash. you can change directions midair.
[0:46:32] <thegraveyardduck> Adam can dash, but that’s it
[0:46:35] <+TopTieramisu> blaze can move well in the air with her air special
[0:46:37] <MattDemers> I love how games like this have points, even though they're not relevant in any ways
[0:46:43] <+ChrisAlgoo> get that wallbounce bois
[0:46:43] <Aussie_Manny> Wall bounce, wall bounce!
[0:46:46] <MayorRev> WOOOOO
[0:46:52] <thegraveyardduck> Points are super relevant in this game
[0:46:53] <thesickestzak> I hope they increase movement speed for everyone by a little bit in a patch or something
[0:46:56] <MayorRev> Cherry's dash attack is the best
[0:47:00] <thegraveyardduck> It’s how you unlock legacy characters
[0:47:02] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> if you charge axels atatck and cancel with back attack while charging again you can outpace anyone without a dedicated dash
[0:47:04] <DeathByPoke7> jam session
[0:47:05] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> except floyd
[0:47:06] <Ghostbody> TIGER KNEE
[0:47:10] <+TopTieramisu> i'd argue cherry's dash attack is too good
[0:47:13] <brunoberserk> only cherry and adam can dash , this one of the feel problems in this game
[0:47:15] <Saltmeisterr> points give lives
[0:47:18] <Sabbrewolf> Air grab means grabbing a thrown weapon out of the air.
[0:47:21] <%SuperKirby24> @MattDemers imagine if instead of points they were body counts LUL
[0:47:21] <Sedrelic> cherry can run
[0:47:29] <thegraveyardduck> Nah no dash is fine. People just aren’t used to it
[0:47:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> not everyone in the game needs a dash or run
[0:47:35] <+LethalweaponLord> no
[0:47:36] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> floyd can do a jumping special that rockets him across the levels
[0:47:37] <$Hotironclad> Yup
[0:47:38] <BoneofMalkav> SOR 3 had running
[0:47:38] <%Jbulleit97> Some characters move slightly faster when jumping.
[0:47:39] <brunoberserk> no is not , streets of rage 3 everyone can run
[0:47:40] <+solzan2000> no run
[0:47:40] <staticshock5> Yeah the made it like Streets of Rage 2 in particular
[0:47:42] <rubbishbinge> He's old, give him some time
[0:47:43] <agadejobi> You could run in SoR 3
[0:47:45] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Streets of Rage 3 had runnings, up and down rolls
[0:47:45] <+Chazmosis> In SOR3 everyone could run
[0:47:45] <+LethalweaponLord> running was universal in 3
[0:47:47] <KillMyPast> SoR3 characters can run
[0:47:48] <MrJazzbo> Skate can run in 2, everyone could run in 3
[0:47:49] <+Jintais3rd> Jumping is the fastest for characters that can't dash
[0:47:49] <+OmegaAmen> This is SOR2 Axel walk speed
[0:47:52] <TalisKanju> People can run in SOR3
[0:47:52] <KillMyPast> Some characters have dashes or rolls
[0:47:54] <+ChrisAlgoo> SOR2 was the good one eyyyy
[0:47:58] <+SaltySombrero> SoR2 only Skate could run, but even then you got throgh stages fine
[0:48:01] <epsypepsy> sor3 u can run
[0:48:01] <thegraveyardduck> There’s enemies every few feet. You really don’t need a run
[0:48:03] <Sabbrewolf> Blaze has weapon combos eh?
[0:48:07] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> and blaze can do j2 ump kick specials
[0:48:08] <TheAmazingClaytor> Catwalk
[0:48:18] <MayorRev> @WoolieVersus When you use a special you take 'fake' damage. Hit enemies with normal attacks to regain it. If you get hit, it becomes real damage.
[0:48:20] <gekizenbu> cherry hass a dash as well
[0:48:21] <%Superblooms> everyone could run in SOR3. In the fan remake, they gave everyone a run.
[0:48:31] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> and since blaze doesnt lose much life on her air special you can use it to travel very fast
[0:48:33] <TomosukeUsagi> I don't know if I really like the art style. Just makes me think of a flash game for some reason.
[0:48:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie is starting to feel it, yeyeye
[0:48:48] <andrei11dr> But wasn't Final Fight 1 like that as well?
[0:48:52] <+Dr_DangerPhD> please tell me what flash games you're playing that look like this
[0:48:58] <MayorRev> reggie is axel yea?
[0:48:58] <Ghostbody> ^
[0:48:59] <+twohitgood> cherry has a head stomp and follow up
[0:49:00] <%paladinstarbuster> Attack to gai health back
[0:49:00] <Saltmeisterr> most flash games don't look this good
[0:49:03] <%SomersaultJustice> you can tech if you jump before you hit the ground
[0:49:04] <+jetjagger222> soften throws with up+jump with exact timing
[0:49:07] <thesickestzak> @dr_dangerphd for real
[0:49:09] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> most games dont look this good
[0:49:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> GET FUCKED
[0:49:10] <%optimasmaximas> lul
[0:49:10] <TheAmazingClaytor> YOOO
[0:49:12] <+Ascethetic> @WoolieVersus circle in the air
[0:49:13] <Torgue_1> @MayorRev Reggie is Blaze
[0:49:13] <thegraveyardduck> you take more grey damage from specials the higher the difficulty. It’s basically nothing on Easy, and a big ass chunk on Maniac
[0:49:14] <%Solidnick18> reggie is blaze
[0:49:18] <+Jintais3rd> Same car from SoR2
[0:49:18] <+SaltySombrero> @TomosukeUsagi I can't agree - this looks much better than a flash game
[0:49:22] <fluke_LKZ> Mans saying that as if it was bad, when plenty of flash games looked good even back then
[0:49:32] <thegraveyardduck> Listen to this track
[0:49:36] <%SomersaultJustice> you have to enable r1
[0:49:40] <+OmegaAmen> Real-time lighting reflecting off the skin of character sprites. I have not seen Flash do that.
[0:49:41] <Sabbrewolf> Air Grab is for grabbing weapons out of the air.
[0:49:47] <%Exiliator> SourPls
[0:49:48] <+TopTieramisu> also, don't be dissing flash. some professional animations studios use flash and i assure it doesn't look like newgrounds
[0:49:50] <+twohitgood> and cherry's neutral air attack can launch/juggle.
[0:49:51] <+Dakuu75> DC continues its trend of making bad-ass animated movies with the new Justice League: Dark Apocalypse War. fucking nutz.
[0:49:58] <$Hotironclad> If there is a flash game that looks like this,. please let me know
[0:50:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Poutine, in the trash can, where it belongs
[0:50:09] <+tigerfang86> TRASH CAN CROISSANT
[0:50:12] <%NocturnGamma> Stepped out for a bit, am I needed to defend Naruto again?
[0:50:16] <thegraveyardduck> Those hit sounds are so satisfying
[0:50:17] <+Ether101_Prime> The car crash was an idea planed for the originally meant for Streets of Rage 2.
[0:50:18] <shinjoshua> friendly fire is off? cowards.
[0:50:20] <Th3rd3> Trash Food TPFufun
[0:50:21] <TomosukeUsagi> I don't like it. I'm free to dislike the art style, calm down NotLikeThis skyBruh
[0:50:21] <whaydoe> Castle crashers was flash? Kinda looks like it a little.
[0:50:24] <+Ascethetic> Donovan and his air counter can fuck off
[0:50:25] <+hod_fareview> SKULLOMANIA
[0:50:28] <Tauredian> rememer to zap the arcade machiens with the taser for the retro bosses
[0:50:34] <+Keiyum> @WoolieVersus Jump while grabbing someone with cherry to do her head mount, that's not actually an air grab
[0:50:39] <whaydoe> ppl are free to disagree bruh LUL
[0:50:40] <odd_slater> I think there's a fan Streets Of Rage that came out before this that you could download
[0:50:40] <ISkyHunterI> SourPls this music
[0:50:43] <+mighty_max_t> Is that a common pick-up noise? It sounds really familiar but I've never played SOR
[0:50:48] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:50:50] <thegraveyardduck> Donovan’s anti air always gets me, and I always feel like a fool
[0:50:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, are these enemies regaining health?
[0:50:57] <ofalconer> You can catch weapons again after you throw them!
[0:50:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:51:03] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Keiyum if you hold down while jumping she can head mount any time
[0:51:03] <thegraveyardduck> No, they have multi layered health bars
[0:51:05] <+TopTieramisu> @CommanderSqueaks layered health bar
[0:51:06] <epsypepsy> @odd_slater streets of rage remake
[0:51:07] <Th3rd3> @Ascethetic you need to respect Donovan, don't jump in front of him PunOko
[0:51:10] <Shardlab> Yes Caesar, it is Violence!
[0:51:14] <MayorRev> Fun chat topic: What's everyone's food settings? Mine are donuts and cheeseburgers
[0:51:25] <fattydragon> Onion rings and the anime meat with a bone
[0:51:33] <whaydoe> Salad and apple, I'm on a diet
[0:51:34] <%Superblooms> classic apple/chicken
[0:51:35] <Ghostbody> Poutine and fries
[0:51:35] <+Jintais3rd> I started with the original, then did Onion Rings and The Burger
[0:51:36] <+Ascethetic> @Th3rd3 but its so tempting when you are playing as Cherry LUL
[0:51:36] <fattydragon> honestly, I do like this game but it can get a bit difficult solo
[0:51:38] <ShawnEXE> onigiri and ramen is tight
[0:51:38] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> nah you can just head stomp and dive into it
[0:51:43] <scrumbotime> Poor Dylan was just chilling there then he took a pipe to the face
[0:51:44] <+Keiyum> @Dr_DangerPhD wow thought she needed to headstomp once before you could do that
[0:51:49] <odd_slater> @epsypepsy Yeah I think that's what I saw
[0:51:49] <thegraveyardduck> Mine’s rice and poutine
[0:51:51] <%picante_papi> xGOMIEx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Blaze new waifu
[0:51:51] <MayorRev> Watch it, Dylan has crazy kicks
[0:51:55] <+Jintais3rd> I wish there was a drink so I could have a Drink and Burger With Fires combo (V.Joe)
[0:51:55] <TheAmazingClaytor> Look at this fucken anime nerd keeping his hands in his pockets LUL
[0:51:58] <+TopTieramisu> i'd say normal mode is not hard
[0:52:03] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also you can heagrab and slap a little, jump off and grab again
[0:52:06] <+TopTieramisu> i game over'd once in my first playthrough
[0:52:09] <fattydragon> you gotta stream sengoku 3 sometime, woolie
[0:52:10] <Saltmeisterr> francis has thecrazy kicks
[0:52:15] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also this has a sengoku 3 combo system
[0:52:16] <+Jintais3rd> Sengoku 3 is sick, but that game is TOO long
[0:52:17] <thesickestzak> cwosont
[0:52:23] <MayorRev> Oh francis is the dylan with white hair yea?
[0:52:25] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you can hit objects to add to the combo meter
[0:52:27] <+jetjagger222> i did not like sengoku 3; you did way too little damage and the bosses were OP
[0:52:30] <%gunsrlove> 2003 Rapper Man with the baggy pants is too strong
[0:52:30] <+Ascethetic> her air throw is the best
[0:52:30] <%KineKithZen> Woolie Bait: The Character
[0:52:31] <thegraveyardduck> Normal is pretty easy if you know what you’re doing, yeah.
[0:52:34] <%SomersaultJustice> yeah, I was never into sengoku 3
[0:52:45] <+jetjagger222> plus the enemies looked really fugly
[0:52:47] <brunoberserk> sengoku 3 have cool combos , but god that have AWFUL boss fights
[0:52:52] <MayorRev> oopie
[0:52:53] <+GrumbleGrouse> The blaze death screech is still here <3
[0:53:04] <%Superblooms> did my first playthrough on hard, and lost quite a few times.
[0:53:05] <$Hotironclad> Personally, I prefer playing this game solo or duo. any more feel unbalanced to me. but it's meant for fun for that many.
[0:53:06] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also if you use a weapon on an object it don't damage it's durability
[0:53:06] <thegraveyardduck> picking up food or points resets the combo countdown too
[0:53:08] <+Chazmosis> Sengoku 3 went on WAY TOO long IMO
[0:53:14] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus You have to activate it on settings
[0:53:18] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think blaze's voice matches her look
[0:53:20] <+SaltySombrero> Watch out
[0:53:21] <%NocturnGamma> Beat em Ups never had enough combo variety for me. They always felt too restrictive
[0:53:22] <gekizenbu> NO LAW ALL CRIMES
[0:53:23] <+SaltySombrero> for knife guy
[0:53:26] <mistermastergreg> enbT
[0:53:30] <transporterthesequel> The star attack option for R1 was not checked @woolieversus
[0:53:34] <+jetjagger222> i had more fun with sengoku 1 despite it being objectively shit; the music and graphics were super trippy
[0:53:37] <MayorRev> DIVA
[0:53:39] <+SaltySombrero> @TopTieramisu "Why doesn't her voice facem atch her face face?"
[0:53:41] <%paladinstarbuster> Blaze sounds way more different than she looks
[0:53:55] <%Superblooms> and i love that for some weird reason.
[0:53:55] <%Solidnick18> sick
[0:53:57] <%gunsrlove> Rise UPPA
[0:53:58] <MayorRev> That's the pacman sound!
[0:54:00] <fandango2112> blaze sounds like makoto
[0:54:01] <+SaltySombrero> will this boss wipe the boys?
[0:54:03] <MayorRev> when you eat food
[0:54:09] <scrumbotime> Wow they really reworked D.Va in that last patch
[0:54:10] <+jetjagger222> blaze blitz attack can hit OTG and relaunch
[0:54:16] <odd_slater> SourPls
[0:54:21] <KaiserMario> Does Axel say "Caramba!"?
[0:54:24] <$Hotironclad> As someone that played River City Girls, I found this game's combat to be more fun imo\
[0:54:26] <TheAmazingClaytor> SourPls
[0:54:29] <+TopTieramisu> blaze dribbles her foes
[0:54:31] <+Dr_DangerPhD> no he's saying grand upper
[0:54:34] <andrei11dr> Just random evil altar on streets
[0:54:35] <%jiggy_snipe> @KaiserMario Grand Upper
[0:54:39] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> I think it's great how when you pick blaze she says "Blaze Fielding" like a tough inner city cop, but all her atatcks are in high pitched japanese
[0:54:50] <thegraveyardduck> This game has a lot of stuff going on in its combat, it’s really enjoyable
[0:55:01] <KaiserMario> @jiggy_snipe ah i see
[0:55:05] <Huntercd> Was Blaze so thick? I don't remember her in the original like this
[0:55:06] <ViceKingKuma> oh shit this has 3 player co-op?
[0:55:10] <@Menitta> Her weapon is a snake?
[0:55:11] <alexandrecau> fuck off kevin
[0:55:12] <%steelmorrigan> I loved playing Cherry, she's awesome
[0:55:12] <+SaltySombrero> Blaze was always stacked
[0:55:16] <LtThunderbolt> he's saying panda-paw!
[0:55:18] <+TopTieramisu> yo reggie is getting it
[0:55:19] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> this has 4p co-op
[0:55:20] <BallerSwagBro9k> 4 player max
[0:55:21] <MayorRev> Don't jump towards Dylan, they're anti-air iirc
[0:55:23] <+prime_name> Why does this voicelines remind me of DonDong?
[0:55:24] <+Ether101_Prime> The game has 4 player local co-op.
[0:55:32] <MayorRev> F
[0:55:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> ads are super important in this game since forward and back throws give you iframes
[0:55:33] <%Daba_mk2> Rip woolz
[0:55:34] <%Solidnick18> he's just dead
[0:55:36] <%SuperKirby24> F
[0:55:36] <Saltmeisterr> donovan is the anti air guy
[0:55:39] <+TopTieramisu> blaze definitely looks better than she ever has
[0:55:39] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> if youre on pc 4 player online as well
[0:55:44] <%nothuzad> ViceKingKuma 4p lcal - 2p online (well maybe 4p online if oyu use the steam streaming)
[0:55:45] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> because steam friends or parsec
[0:55:47] <%SomersaultJustice> jason mews also anti airs
[0:55:50] <@Menitta> So does doing the special moves cost life still?
[0:55:55] <thegraveyardduck> The game even tells you to take advantage of iframes from throws
[0:55:55] <MayorRev> Yea Dylan and Donovan can both anti-air, right
[0:56:04] <+SaltySombrero> @Menitta yes, but it can be gotten back if you hit enemies
[0:56:06] <+jetjagger222> @Menitta recoverable life
[0:56:07] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Menitta yeah but there's a rally system where you can get it back
[0:56:08] <+Ether101_Prime> That's because Streets of Rage is inspired by Final Fight.
[0:56:09] <%wolfofsound> wolfofsound subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Where is Rage of Africa? Aren't these his streets?
[0:56:12] <thegraveyardduck> It does grey damage
[0:56:15] <@Menitta> Ah cool I like that
[0:56:24] <MayorRev> gg
[0:56:25] <thegraveyardduck> It’s an excellent change
[0:56:28] <TheAmazingClaytor> Clap
[0:56:32] <+solzan2000> lol
[0:56:32] <+jetjagger222> Sor and final fight are a lot like art of fighting/fatal fury to SF1
[0:56:32] <%Solidnick18> ooo
[0:56:33] <%Superblooms> i really hope they continue with support and DLC.

[0:56:46] <andrei11dr> Blazes voice is kinda weird ,it doesn't match her look at all

[0:57:18] <%Solidnick18> big grappler i'm guessing
[0:57:21] <thegraveyardduck> His air special into air attack is super satisfying
[0:57:22] <%astrophizz> Floyd has an awesome grab
[0:57:22] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> ok but sor 1 wasn't made as a response to final fight, it was made as a response to street fighter 2

[1:11:45] <+Kduff89> not only that all the data is on the cart. You dont have to download shit
[1:11:54] <MayorRev> Fire barrels are dangerous but sometimes have stuff in em @WoolieVersus
[1:11:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> SoulSilver costs more now than it did in 2010. you ain't lying NotLikeThis
[1:11:58] <%SomersaultJustice> blaze is my fave
[1:11:58] <CapTaySparta> We going on a trip on a big old cargo ship
[1:12:00] <Byr0nX> cause she can actualy move
[1:12:02] <+jetjagger222> blaze seems to be the best character
[1:12:03] <%KineKithZen> Axel has a Dempsey Roll type thing
[1:12:05] <+TopTieramisu> blaze is fun
[1:12:11] <+Ether101_Prime> Axel feels like he could be half a frame faster.
[1:12:15] <+TopTieramisu> i like blaze a lot be she is absolutely not the strongest
[1:12:16] <+TheOneCalledRock> Axel has hitstun combos
[1:12:17] <CapTaySparta> Adam is my guy
[1:12:17] <fandango2112> woolie use floyeds air special
[1:12:21] <MayorRev> Francis is the crazy kick guy
[1:12:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:24] <+TopTieramisu> i'd say cherry and adam are the best
[1:12:25] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> floyd is better than blaze in most ways but is less safe
[1:12:30] <$Noponiz> blaze's voice is really bad and unfitting
[1:12:30] <+zsteezymike> There’s a 3 player mode ???
[1:12:32] <+zsteezymike> Wtfffff
[1:12:32] <+jetjagger222> axel grand upper is a wee bit underpowered
[1:12:35] <+zsteezymike> Am I watching
[1:12:36] <MaxPainChaos> He can't handle axel LUL
[1:12:37] <%Solidnick18> oh i see that axel shit
[1:12:40] <Saltmeisterr> every character has the flaws and uses
[1:12:40] <%SomersaultJustice> there;s a 4 PLAYER mode
[1:12:42] <Daxalog> Try running / Dashing now
[1:12:43] <fandango2112> @WoolieVersus use floyeds air special

[1:12:49] <+zsteezymike> 4 PLAYER
[1:12:49] <%Superblooms> is there a physical release? or is there one coming?
[1:12:50] <CapTaySparta> @zsteezymike actually 4 player
[1:12:52] <thegraveyardduck> Blaze is my least fav character, tbh. I like Adam and Axel most, and I’m really warming up on Floyd
[1:12:55] <KingVantq> @zsteezymike 4 players local 2 online
[1:12:56] <+zsteezymike> Since when wtffff
[1:12:58] <+Ether101_Prime> Axel has the coolest Star Special.
[1:12:58] <Saltmeisterr> Axel is good single target damage
[1:12:59] <+zsteezymike> Ohhhh
[1:13:01] <+tigerfang86> SLAP
[1:13:01] <MayorRev> BIG BOY
[1:13:03] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @Superblooms check out Limited Run
[1:13:03] <+zsteezymike> Local
[1:13:04] <andrei11dr> Axel is like an even more hobo Terry Bogart
[1:13:08] <+Ornightz> Floyd can Grab 2 enemies @WoolieVersus
[1:13:15] <thegraveyardduck> Axel’s forward special is excellent on bosses
[1:13:20] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @Superblooms PS4 & Switch, definitely
[1:13:24] <$Noponiz> cherri feels like an intentionally broken character tbh
[1:13:30] <%astrophizz> throw enemies at barrels
[1:13:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Axel's forward special after grand upper can delete most basic enemies
[1:13:35] <+Ascethetic> @WoolieVersus Floyd's side special is a grab
[1:13:36] <+TopTieramisu> axel's forward special is monstrous
[1:13:37] <+Kduff89> yo these guys are all kicks. I respect it
[1:13:38] <MayorRev> thicc lad
[1:13:39] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> adam has the coolest moves though. If you dash past an enemy he automatically turns around. also his neutral jump attack hits behind him and vacuum the enemy towards you
[1:13:40] <fandango2112> woolie air special do it please
[1:13:41] <Byr0nX> dont worry, you'll get annoyed by him soon
[1:13:42] <LtThunderbolt> big boy
[1:13:44] <masterfire23> watching this gameplay i want a guacamelee 2 lp LUL
[1:13:51] <MayorRev> "hehehehehe"
[1:13:54] <%Solidnick18> Big ben
[1:13:55] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @Noponiz WHY DO YOU THINK WOOLIE PICKED HER FIRST
[1:13:56] <odd_slater> SourPls
[1:13:56] <thegraveyardduck> I love that they don’t take their hands out of their pockets
[1:13:59] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[1:14:05] <+mechslayer71> Exe kick from a chick in a tight miniskirt, what a way to go Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:14:06] <agadejobi> I wonder if R. Bear will return as a boss
[1:14:11] <MayorRev> Big ben has a peter griffin laugh
[1:14:11] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:14:11] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also he shouts WOOO every time
[1:14:12] <+mechslayer71> Axe kick*
[1:14:12] <MayorRev> its so good
[1:14:23] <+ElectricFoxLex> Grand Upper is special cancelable
[1:14:25] <thegraveyardduck> Oh my god rev
[1:14:29] <thegraveyardduck> it is peter griffin
[1:14:31] <%Jbulleit97> Are you guys planning on finishing the game today? If so, could you take a look at the concept art gallery before you end the stream? It's got some really cool stuff.
[1:14:37] <coreybom> Yo woolie, you got a web grab with Floyd that you can do mid combo for a combo extender.
[1:14:38] <CapTaySparta> He Fat Asf Boi
[1:14:40] <fandango2112> woolie use air special
[1:14:46] <MayorRev> ooooooh that sounds useful
[1:14:53] <MayorRev> I should check that out
[1:15:00] <SheefEatsBeef> like godhand weaving?
[1:15:00] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you have a similar mechanic in this game, neutral jump is a parry
[1:15:02] <+jetjagger222> knights of the round and the dnd brawlers made block work
[1:15:08] <+Adulfzen> neutral special is klnda the defensive move
[1:15:08] <+Ornightz> The game lacks ground attacks
[1:15:09] <+Dr_DangerPhD> forward and back throws have iframes as well
[1:15:14] <thegraveyardduck> Grabbing a launched enemy back for more punching is real fun
[1:15:18] <%SomersaultJustice> like, it's not literally a parry
[1:15:20] <+ElectricFoxLex> Not a parry
[1:15:23] <$Noponiz> River city girls also made block works fairly well, but I do generally agree
[1:15:24] <Who_lio42> Empty neutral jump as I-frames
[1:15:25] <MayorRev> Knife bois
[1:15:30] <%astrophizz> no, just invuln going up
[1:15:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> This game has options to allow combos and its great
[1:15:32] <fandango2112> woolie air special can be used more then onece
[1:15:33] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> it is, you have infinite I frame son neutral jump
[1:15:36] <+TopTieramisu> empty neutral jump is more like a spot dodge
[1:15:37] <MayorRev> dont be afraid to use specials here
[1:15:38] <Tauredian> oldboy alley scene tribute
[1:15:38] <+Ether101_Prime> The dodge mechanic in DDN buffs the character.
[1:15:44] <+Ornightz> River city girls has a block feature and ground attacks
[1:15:51] <MayorRev> stars i mean
[1:16:08] <%astrophizz> It's while you're going up
[1:16:10] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also back atatcks cancel alot of things
[1:16:11] <CapTaySparta> Thoughts on the game so far?
[1:16:14] <+ExcessiveCensorship> @WoolieVersus saw that LittleV Hoes mad video gotta say its pretty fucking catchy
[1:16:16] <+FairOnFire> jumping, neutral special and throwing are basically your defense
[1:16:16] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> and cancel into alot of things
[1:16:22] <Who_lio42> in DDN run button is the real combo button lol
[1:16:25] <+tigerfang86> Kreygasm
[1:16:26] <MayorRev> whoowee
[1:16:28] <%Solidnick18> kinky
[1:16:29] <zamzoph> Kreygasm
[1:16:30] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:16:32] <+Jintais3rd> Galsiaaaaaaaaaa
[1:16:34] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[1:16:35] <odd_slater> Kreygasm
[1:16:37] <%Jbulleit97> Someone tell 'em about the spike wall!
[1:16:39] <MayorRev> Those dudes are tough when she whips em
[1:16:41] <LtThunderbolt> that Ash poster
[1:16:41] <agadejobi> Electra
[1:16:42] <MayorRev> They get armor
[1:16:45] <Who_lio42> Nora is an old character iirc
[1:16:46] <+tigerfang86> THE TRIPLE
[1:16:46] <agadejobi> In Streets of Rage 2
[1:16:47] <scrumbotime> Noison
[1:16:49] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> lets all talk about the spike wall
[1:16:50] <BoneofMalkav> All 3 SOR games had whip girls iirc
[1:16:51] <thegraveyardduck> There’s a poster of Ash on the far left, a Japan only SoR3 character
[1:16:52] <$Noponiz> that was such a waste lmao
[1:16:54] <Byr0nX> Nora\Electra
[1:16:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nopoi Son
[1:16:56] <DedlokPM> there was indeed whip girls in Streets of Rage
[1:16:57] <TerrorRISK> Nora was SOR1 and Electra was SOR2, they had em before.
[1:16:59] <+OmegaWeltall> Step on meeee, spit in my mouth Kreygasm
[1:17:01] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> there is a spike wall next to a poster of Ash from sor 3
[1:17:01] <+Ether101_Prime> Nora's from the original games guys and she's clearly a send up to Linda from Double Dragon.
[1:17:01] <%jiggy_snipe> its fine Axle and Cody are pretty much the same person
[1:17:05] <MayorRev> I just noticed their names
[1:17:07] <CapTaySparta> GET EM
[1:17:08] <thegraveyardduck> Japan only cause he was a pretty bad gay stereotype
[1:17:08] <MayorRev> GALSIAAAAAAAA
[1:17:12] <$Noponiz> why does blaze sound like athena but look like laura
[1:17:13] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> we need to understand this concept, and explore it
[1:17:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh, we horny now??
[1:17:22] <%Solidnick18> oooo
[1:17:24] <+tigerfang86> THE REGRAB
[1:17:26] <Byr0nX> DROPPED
[1:17:26] <fandango2112> he found
[1:17:28] <+tigerfang86> THE REGRAB TECH
[1:17:31] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> its like maximum carnage
[1:17:32] <+Ornightz> Axel has a air Special
[1:17:34] <MayorRev> yeah use your heravies
[1:17:36] <+ElectricFoxLex> Reggie what you can do as Axel is, the first 3 hits of the strings, stop, 3 hits again, into grand upper and cancel the second hit of grand upper into forward special
[1:17:37] <MayorRev> they gud
[1:17:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> We in Bionic Commando now.
[1:17:42] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> he also has the double slam just like spider man
[1:17:46] <MayorRev> your character will flash
[1:17:46] <VelcroSnake> Don't need to charge it, just forward ans Special pretty sure
[1:18:01] <odd_slater> SourPls Sax
[1:18:01] <+Ether101_Prime> Also, spikes on the wall.
[1:18:09] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also he can kara cancel charge into blitz attack
[1:18:10] <$Noponiz> the wallbounces PogChamp
[1:18:11] <thegraveyardduck> It’s just forward special, yeah
[1:18:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> magic pixel
[1:18:18] <MayorRev> gg
[1:18:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @ElectricFoxLex or you can do 3 hits, walk up and grab 3 hits into launcher, hit into grand upper and then forward special
[1:18:28] <Byr0nX> this isnt SNK
[1:18:33] <kulmoth> D
[1:18:41] <+TopTieramisu> super is a consumable

[1:44:54] <MayorRev> nice nice
[1:44:57] <+hod_fareview> POWAH WAVE
[1:45:01] <staticshock5> @woolieversus Floyd has a far range grab btw
[1:45:09] <MayorRev> cleavers
[1:45:15] <MayorRev> aw dang
[1:45:26] <MayorRev> free food!
[1:45:29] <%KineKithZen> Octopus poutine DansGame
[1:45:42] <lufasamufasa> Maximum cleavage but no Blaze. :(
[1:45:46] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> like I ssadi he has a wave dash, so like, there's techincal shit here
[1:45:47] <+badjab326> Axel's Aerial special is important
[1:45:48] <wrydiculous> simple to play but hard to master
[1:45:55] <MayorRev> that dude just saw his friend die
[1:46:00] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also axel hits hard and his grab series is an easy launch
[1:46:03] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Axel can do instant throw cancels with weapons on enemy hit
[1:46:16] <odiz395> Adam strat up look like B.P. Vesst from the COPS cartoon
[1:46:19] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> everyone can
[1:46:23] <+Ornightz> They should have nerf's axels and blazes Run
[1:46:27] <+Ether101_Prime> Its green damage.
[1:46:33] <+Ornightz> Not*
[1:46:39] <fluke_LKZ> Who doing the videos?
[1:46:42] <fluke_LKZ> I misheard
[1:46:48] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also you can use a weapon, then use the weapon special, and then throw it
[1:46:54] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> unless youre blaze, hers is slow
[1:46:55] <+jetjagger222> this stage is long, gg
[1:46:57] <devil_may_cum_> Music going in
[1:46:57] <%Solidnick18> they are real annoying
[1:47:08] <+Ether101_Prime> Wait until two rooms form now.
[1:47:13] <wrydiculous> Pro tip for the one enemy up ahead: THROW
[1:47:18] <fandango2112> woolie dont view the moves as super view them as special
[1:47:26] <MayorRev> You can armor through their attacks with neutral sopecials then follow up when their armor is gone @WoolieVersus
[1:47:27] <Saltmeisterr> yeah throw this guy
[1:47:27] <+ram8704> AI is more aggressive the more ppl are playing
[1:47:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:47:30] <%kyh9> MAKOTO
[1:47:30] <thegraveyardduck> not being able to run is part of their balance. There’s a reason cherry and adam are so good: mobility is huge in beat em ups, and especially so in this one.
[1:47:32] <+solzan2000> ayyy
[1:47:33] <+Ether101_Prime> Throw this mother fucker.

[1:48:10] <wrydiculous> just throw him to death
[1:48:12] <+SaltySombrero> ICHIGEKI HISSATSU
[1:48:24] <lufasamufasa> ZANRETSUKEN.

[1:48:38] <+Ether101_Prime> Garsa Hell.
[1:48:39] <lufasamufasa> A later version of him has the Zanretsuken.
[1:48:42] <thegraveyardduck> oh man this room is gonna fuck em up
[1:48:43] <+ram8704> Easy to get washed in these three rooms
[1:48:44] <Saltmeisterr> the Galsia room
[1:48:45] <shinjoshua> thats a regular enemy
[1:48:46] <%Nekros4442> That's just a real fucking naginata
[1:48:46] <thegraveyardduck> same for the next room
[1:48:48] <+SaltySombrero> don't get hit
[1:48:53] <scrumbotime> A Naginata just, doesn't seem fair in a street fight
[1:48:53] <+jetjagger222> fuck this room
[1:48:54] <wrydiculous> you gotta work that naginata
[1:49:03] <+Jintais3rd> This room is one of the most cursed in the game
[1:49:04] <Th3rd3> this room is danger
[1:49:08] <thegraveyardduck> absolutely don’t let them get the naginatas
[1:49:08] <+Keiyum> sickest jam INCOMING
[1:49:12] <MayorRev> This room is hell alone
[1:49:16] <+Jintais3rd> These guys, WITH RANGE
[1:49:17] <+Ether101_Prime> This room is the hardest part of the game for me.
[1:49:21] <+Qsmash_> Galsia with a Naginata should have been the final boss
[1:49:22] <MayorRev> Co-op is helpful
[1:49:23] <Saltmeisterr> what is the room like on mania?
[1:49:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> does this have online multiplayer?
[1:49:30] <fluke_LKZ> ACTIVE FRAME GODS
[1:49:32] <thegraveyardduck> This room is easy if you hoard the naginatas
[1:49:36] <%nintega010> the meme lives
[1:49:46] <+Keiyum> room isn't that bad if you neutral jump too, galsia dies to jump attacks
[1:49:46] <wrydiculous> multiplayer makes this room a lot easier
[1:49:46] <staticshock5> @fuqboislim Yes with one other person
[1:49:50] <exileshadow03> This part really sucks, no health for another screen
[1:49:52] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:49:53] <Th3rd3> @FuqBoiSlim 2 player online and 4 player local
[1:49:55] <+LastHazzerd> Thug-kuza

[1:50:13] <+LastHazzerd> boy this IS Wu-Tang
[1:50:13] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> he needs to wear weighted clothing to hide his power level
[1:50:14] <%fetrigon> hopefully they add vfx trails to weapon swings
[1:50:14] <tetrabrick1lt> no blood?
[1:50:15] <+jetjagger222> third room is full of muay thai dudes
[1:50:16] <Torgue_1> Pants down= white belt in this universe
[1:50:17] <thegraveyardduck> The next room is hard too, red knee boy and another joe
[1:50:19] <%jiggy_snipe> still wearing their timbs
[1:50:26] <+rednecked__crake> rip atpRtsd
[1:50:27] <Who_lio42> Wu-tang is for the children
[1:50:30] <lufasamufasa> Never jump against Donovans.
[1:50:31] <%doombawkzvs> @WoolieVersus You can do soft cancel out of a surprising amount of different animations using dash and jump, letting you link combos that would otherwise be impossible. Don't be afraid to get creative with movement. Mobility is a big part of the game. (Also nice hoodies)
[1:50:33] <+Ether101_Prime> Real word conditions Woolie, real world conditions.

[1:53:39] <Saltmeisterr> minh the coward
[1:53:49] <+Ether101_Prime> Its the lifetime score is cumulative.
[1:53:52] <%vincerocmm> woooo

[1:54:01] <jeybull13> Yo fuk y island
[1:54:01] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> wow peace keepers reference
[1:54:02] <%Solidnick18> all the way back here
[1:54:10] <MayorRev> yea
[1:54:12] <%dOjOTron> Adam is the GOAT
[1:54:20] <%KineKithZen> If it's the game I'm thinking of the arcade version was solid too
[1:54:25] <+TheOneCalledRock> also this is just story mode, you have acade mode and stage select afterwards too
[1:54:31] <MayorRev> If you wanna aim for the top of the leaderboards solo is the only thing counted
[1:54:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[1:54:33] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also a beat em up game with a secret input to turn super saiyan, but actually
[1:54:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> which add to your score
[1:54:39] <+badjab326> Peace Keepers only had 4p battle mode lol
[1:54:41] <MayorRev> TIGER KNEE
[1:54:55] <MayorRev> the beat drops when he jumps in
[1:54:58] <MayorRev> its great
[1:54:58] <+ram8704> Honestly Adam should have been the main for this game. Find Axel in the bar and he joins
[1:55:03] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> shame battle mode in peace keepers is super broken
[1:55:05] <odd_slater> SourPls
[1:55:11] <MayorRev> WHOOO
[1:55:12] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> battle mode in this is awesome though
[1:55:15] <%dOjOTron> that dash in is super nice
[1:55:16] <devil_may_cum_> Music going in

[1:55:39] <+Estuko> Rick Flair: FeelsAmazingMan
[1:55:42] <wrydiculous> i absolutely love adams neitral jump kick
[1:55:51] <+LastHazzerd> mwehehehehehehe
[1:55:55] <%Strtfghtr88> MJ VIBES
[1:56:03] <+LastHazzerd> nothing beats The Blob
[1:56:09] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> ok but a better combo for adam is grab, up attack, forward special, charge charge attack, then jump + down air like 20 times
[1:56:10] <%KineKithZen> I like how one fat guy has armor on the roll, the other on his attack but not the roll
[1:56:17] <MayorRev> Big food when you beat this sectiopn
[1:56:38] <MayorRev> BIG combo
[1:57:14] <MayorRev> You're doing good!
[1:57:25] <MayorRev> Getting enough points will give you an extra life
[1:57:27] <+NWannabe> oof, woolie's a food hog
[1:57:30] <%dOjOTron> Adam has a short dash with forward forward to keep pressure and escapes
[1:57:37] <MayorRev> throw it
[1:57:37] <+NWannabe> thats like the 3rd time someone with lower life didnt get food
[1:57:37] <%Strtfghtr88> Father daughter combo
[1:58:01] <MayorRev> nice
[1:58:16] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> YEHA I KNOW
[1:58:19] <%doombawkzvs> I told you that you should be creative
[1:58:31] <MayorRev> Cherry's the lightest character
[1:58:33] <%doombawkzvs> Game is filled with cool stuff like that
[1:58:33] <MayorRev> super agile
[1:58:35] <%dOjOTron> There is SOME tech in this game
[1:58:38] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> but you can also air throw into air throw
[1:58:47] <+FairOnFire> you can also jump from the air throw early and power dunk
[1:58:47] <+LastHazzerd> well yeah throws are safe, this is Judo
[1:58:53] <wrydiculous> his weakness is throws
[1:58:59] <%HowIPendragon> Gunjumper Minh
[1:59:03] <%dOjOTron> GET REKT

[1:59:23] <+Ether101_Prime> Isn't Judo actually fake though?
[1:59:35] <andrei11dr> They don't teach you to sprawl in karate class
[1:59:36] <Th3rd3> this stab room again TPFufun
[1:59:39] <MayorRev> Cherry is BEASTING
[1:59:46] <+prime_name> nice
[1:59:50] <emeraldskrull> we all lift together
[1:59:55] <kittensRnice> thats some 3 nijas shit
[2:00:00] <+BusinessGooseTV> from what I have seen Cherry is very strong
[2:00:13] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> with blaze you can cancel her blitz attackinto instant air special also
[2:00:19] <+LastHazzerd> the teamwork is beautiful
[2:00:27] <%dOjOTron> Reggie dash with Adam to get in and out
[2:00:53] <+TopTieramisu> just don't abuse his specials if you're gonna hit
[2:01:01] <andrei11dr> @ether101_prime Judo absolutely works on someone that wears clothes, but with no clothes wrestling is wat you want
[2:01:01] <%Strtfghtr88> Reggie doing too many specials with Adam
[2:01:17] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> his specials take a lot of health but if you use deliberate combos you get modst of it back
[2:01:17] <%Strtfghtr88> Adam uses alot of green health
[2:01:24] <wrydiculous> yea dun spam the triangle nilly willy
[2:01:25] <%dOjOTron> this game is to fun
[2:01:29] <+ARoguishHam> Cherry can jump on an enemie's head and land directly into a throw if you press attack just above their dome.
[2:01:30] <+jetjagger222> axel neutral spec is good
[2:01:30] <MayorRev> lmao
[2:01:36] <Th3rd3> respect Donovan
[2:01:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:01:37] <%Nekros4442> Weebs
[2:01:42] <Torgue_1> Cool people, Woolie
[2:01:46] <MayorRev> SPORTS ARE FOR CHUMPS
[2:01:49] <MayorRev> ROCK N ROLL
[2:01:53] <%nothuzad> cool people - also sports for dummies V:
[2:02:01] <+TopTieramisu> cherry's a nerd
[2:02:06] <thegraveyardduck> I’ve been playing this constantly since it came out. Just finished my first arcade run today, super dope it ranks the entire difficulty
[2:02:17] <MayorRev> Blaze the mvp
[2:02:27] <%Strtfghtr88> Awesome
[2:02:28] <+Ether101_Prime> @andrei11dr I thought Judo was the one that required the other guy to throw themselves.
[2:02:32] <%Daba_mk2> team work
[2:02:36] <%KineKithZen> That's aikido
[2:02:38] <+LastHazzerd> Cherry ducktales-ing on folk
[2:02:42] <%dOjOTron> team teamwork
[2:02:47] <brunoberserk> shiva is the best
[2:02:48] <MayorRev> SASUKEEEEEEEE
[2:02:57] <MaxPainChaos> HahaThisisfine
[2:03:00] <+TopTieramisu> genichiro ashiva
[2:03:00] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> he does tech throws but if youre fast you can still do it
[2:03:06] <bruce_locks> Adam is the best
[2:03:29] <+Ether101_Prime> Cherry needs to use those starts.
[2:03:37] <andrei11dr> @ether101_prime No ,you're thinking of Aikido ,Ive seen a Judo player slamm a guy on his head on the street
[2:03:38] <devil_may_cum_> This guy is cool as fuck
[2:03:41] <goose_attack_almanac> Blaze is so big and strong that she has no concerns over throwin' kicks that expose her underwear
[2:03:44] <+ram8704> Shiva bout to wipe the whole crew
[2:03:51] <%Abrigitall> Abrigitall subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:03:51] <goose_attack_almanac> It distracts her oponents
[2:03:53] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also supers are great but really only should be viewed as ways to regain green health fast
[2:03:56] <+Ether101_Prime> @andrei11dr Okay, thanks.
[2:03:59] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> they dont really do damage
[2:04:02] <MayorRev> whyre they called ads?
[2:04:04] <Saltmeisterr> its immediately clear that this is a yoko shimomura track
[2:04:10] <wrydiculous> shiva has been and always be the fucking coolest
[2:04:19] <MayorRev> Two Of Them
[2:04:19] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> they are called ads because they get added to the main fight
[2:04:20] <%dOjOTron> whats the difficulty?
[2:04:23] <DedlokPM> @MayorRev Adds. Because they are ADDitional enemies
[2:04:28] <MayorRev> ohhh makes sense
[2:04:28] <+Ether101_Prime> Normal.
[2:04:30] <+LastHazzerd> Trippelganger
[2:04:31] <%dOjOTron> ok
[2:04:38] <+ram8704> Mr X's old #2
[2:04:40] <wrydiculous> too bad he doesnt do his signature FINAL CRASH
[2:04:42] <+TopTieramisu> welp
[2:04:42] <%SomersaultJustice> can't hit the clones without using the star
[2:04:44] <%dOjOTron> rush him down
[2:04:51] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> this is sadly the only shimomura track
[2:04:56] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> its one to remember though
[2:05:03] <+Ether101_Prime> The game changes some things with multi-player.
[2:05:28] <+TopTieramisu> minh is special hungry
[2:05:28] <%Strtfghtr88> monkaS
[2:05:28] <%dOjOTron> 100% he can do this

[2:09:27] <lufasamufasa> I think he just meant they're kindred spirits and rivals permanently, since they keep end up fighting each other.

[2:36:43] <emeraldskrull> fat always evil
[2:36:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:36:44] <lufasamufasa> Shiva's pretty OP in this game. If SOR4 Shiva ever gets unlocked as a character, he'll probably be even more broken.
[2:36:46] <MayorRev> Roll boy
[2:36:46] <CelestialCage> onree anne ree.
[2:36:51] <+ARoguishHam> Save some starts this is not the worst encounter on this level

[2:37:15] <odd_slater> I don't know what Blaze is saying but I like it lol
[2:37:48] <lufasamufasa> How is SOR3 Blaze in this game?
[2:37:52] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> sor 3 axel has a good grand upper and completely invincible forward special, skate is all over the place
[2:38:11] <+ARoguishHam> that poor guy didn't land for a full min, lol
[2:38:14] <lufasamufasa> Oh yeah, that invincible Forward + Special lmfao.
[2:38:16] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> his normal series ender is a charage attack you can charge attack out of
[2:38:19] <%optimasmaximas> blaze and cherry are....strong women
[2:38:27] <thegraveyardduck> I hate playing as Skate
[2:38:33] <halfmasks> SKULLOMANIA???

[2:38:34] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> hes so good
[2:38:43] <$hypermegashun> yeah me too
[2:38:48] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> his back attack is godlike and spear otgs
[2:38:55] <MayorRev> knife man
[2:38:59] <thegraveyardduck> I do like that all the classic characters feel really different from the main cast since they don’t use the new mechanics
[2:39:05] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[2:39:05] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> but it otgs even if it knocks down in the air
[2:39:18] <Sabbrewolf> He has Telekinetic powers.
[2:39:18] <+ram8704> You can grab the items
[2:39:22] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> even copys of characters all have something different
[2:39:22] <wrydiculous> Hey look, it's NOT Orochi

[2:39:54] <thegraveyardduck> Yeyeye dj time
[2:39:57] <lufasamufasa> Nice, yeah I figured her SOR1 range would be broken in this game lmao.
[2:39:59] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> like sor3 axel does a full combo series even if he doesnt hit, but axel sor2 just jabs, and sor1 axel you can back atatck cancel his third hit to kara
[2:40:03] <Who_lio42> Gotta have your combos on point
[2:40:05] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> its amazing
[2:40:07] <MayorRev> awww thats weird
[2:40:16] <wrydiculous> SOR1 characters in this game is busted
[2:40:26] <+FairOnFire> could be a Bluetooth thing
[2:40:28] <+Ether101_Prime> That's either the game or Axel.
[2:40:36] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> everybody seems busted when you figure out their thing
[2:40:39] <MayorRev> Yeah the only characters that are OP are the classic ones
[2:40:40] <+badjab326> probably bluetooth or battery
[2:40:46] <wrydiculous> true
[2:40:50] <+FairOnFire> ds4 can lag at certain rangea
[2:40:51] <%eyezehuhh> at least it's not a drifting analogue stick

[2:41:50] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Adam is great
[2:41:51] <lufasamufasa> Magaki's the KOF XI final boss.
[2:42:04] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> magaki will be erased from history so dont worry about him
[2:42:04] <+TopTieramisu> worse than igniz?
[2:42:07] <MayorRev> SourPls
[2:42:10] <+Ornightz> lufasamufasa Her damage scaling is a little ridiculous but the most broken character by far is SOR3 skate He shatters police Riot shields off 2 hits and his fwd Blitz
[2:42:15] <lufasamufasa> Worse than Igniz.
[2:42:20] <+Ether101_Prime> Character Info unlocked with stage 9.
[2:42:23] <MayorRev> bonsai trees
[2:42:26] <andrei11dr> Like, Igniz was also bullshit, but at least he was cool
[2:42:27] <+TopTieramisu> because igniz was one some turbo bullshit
[2:42:35] <wrydiculous> Magaki is what happens if you put a Touhou boss in a fighting game

[2:53:12] <BallerSwagBro9k> Shes a dancer
[2:53:13] <MayorRev> Her character select voice is different from her ingame voice
[2:53:13] <Saltmeisterr> i feel like this is the weakest track in the game
[2:53:14] <halfmasks> shes too thicc for that voice
[2:53:17] <DedlokPM> She deflinitely matches her later looks
[2:53:17] <+TopTieramisu> blaze should have a huskier voice
[2:53:18] <+ARoguishHam> Blaze's voice is too high yeah
[2:53:21] <+prime_name> Roxy sounds like shes from Dong-Dong
[2:53:22] <+ARoguishHam> and it was deeper in the other games too
[2:53:26] <+prime_name> Blaze*
[2:53:28] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Adam has a dash
[2:53:31] <+thunka10> LuvPeekR
[2:53:32] <+Ether101_Prime> Blaze is a dance instructor and former cop.

[2:54:02] <wrydiculous> oh this stage is a pain
[2:54:03] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah the reason blaze looks so young still is because she does lambada
[2:54:12] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> so claims yuzo koshiro
[2:54:14] <+Ether101_Prime> You can do ff+attack with weapons with Blaze.
[2:54:28] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you can do blitz atatcks with a weapon with any character
[2:54:45] <halfmasks> oh my god this is mortal kombat
[2:54:49] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> sor3 axel doesnt transform into asura, sadly
[2:54:50] <+Ornightz> She became a dancer after a fight with boss from the force cause she was told to take anger management?

[2:56:56] <thegraveyardduck> the lighting in this area is so good
[2:57:00] <lufasamufasa> Adam seems like he's really solid in this game.
[2:57:04] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> if you have a knife instead of a bat type weapon it even combos
[2:57:35] <MayorRev> NINJAS

[3:02:35] <%Lion_kun> hahahaha
[3:02:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> ASHES TO ASHES MOTHERFUCKER
[3:02:36] <thesickestzak> @lion_kun like 5 minutes lol

[3:02:38] <Sedrelic> this is the final
[3:02:38] <Saltmeisterr> this is final boss
[3:02:46] <%nothuzad> bear_breaker20 in naruto: if you are hot you are morally grey no matter how much fucked up shit you did (not direct quote)
[3:02:47] <%SomersaultJustice> hope they beat him first
[3:02:47] <zamzoph> Maybe it depends on who you damage first?
[3:02:47] <%Lion_kun> My timing was perfect then.
[3:02:55] <%SuperKirby24> punch the mecha Kappa
[3:02:56] <CureMode666> LEFT SIDE IS THE SAFEST
[3:02:58] <+Ether101_Prime> Either sibling can get on thrown.
[3:03:00] <+Qsmash_> it does zamzoph
[3:03:01] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[3:03:01] <coreybom> @beezushrist Also, you’re not playing, so unless they ask, quick backseating.
[3:03:07] <wrydiculous> take out the sister and stay left
[3:03:07] <Saltmeisterr> fun fact: the boss changes depend on who i damage first
[3:03:11] <BallerSwagBro9k> FEEL THE WRATH OF THE USA
[3:03:19] <thegraveyardduck> whoever takes the enough damage first gets in. Best to make Mr Y get in as he’s harder to deal with on foot than Ms Y
[3:03:24] <plushysceptile> Yeah. First to lose a third of their health jumps in
[3:03:25] <%DianaTheAscian> NotLikeThis
[3:03:27] <bleugh> what did i walk in on

[3:03:32] <wrydiculous> oof
[3:03:33] <+TheOneCalledRock> lmao
[3:03:37] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also if you beat the one in the mech the other one takes over the mech
[3:03:47] <+OmegaWeltall> its rough single player but doable
[3:03:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> @TheOneCalledRock Its hell...I taking a break#
[3:03:51] <+ARoguishHam> I like upper right corner, but whtever you do STAY OUT OF THE MIDDLE
[3:03:51] <%jiggy_snipe> does this game scale difficulty with amount of players?
[3:03:52] <+TopTieramisu> F
[3:03:55] <zamzoph> just dodge 4Head

[3:04:10] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yes, with mor eplayers a lot of things change, most definitely damage
[3:04:11] <Th3rd3> @jiggy_snipe yes
[3:04:16] <+ram8704> Does the sister go in the mech if she is killed first?
[3:04:17] <+Ether101_Prime> Deal with the sibling on the ground first as they'll get on the mech when the other is defeated.
[3:04:18] <zamzoph> bruh
[3:04:18] <MayorRev> you can do it!
[3:04:18] <KillMyPast> Gotta gitgud

[3:04:41] <lufasamufasa> @SuperKirby24 Kappa
[3:04:41] <+Jintais3rd> Run it back
[3:04:42] <zamzoph> RESET
[3:04:45] <thegraveyardduck> the mech has a very clear pattern in its attacks and big long tells. This boss is super easy if you pay attention
[3:04:45] <exileshadow03> That's SOR, only the originals would be a full reset
[3:04:47] <+TheOneCalledRock> oh my GOD
[3:04:47] <+Qsmash_> @jiggy_snipe the amount of enemies increases with more players and the damage you deal out is lessened
[3:04:50] <+OmegaWeltall> yea this stage is a bit rough
[3:04:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:04:57] <+bear_breaker20> just be cooler than you were previously ez
[3:05:01] <Saltmeisterr> there is arcade mode tho
[3:05:04] <%jiggy_snipe> ok thx
[3:05:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> just dont get hit 4Head
[3:05:10] <+Estuko> @beezushrist Shh and just watch
[3:05:10] <%gunsrlove> How many stages are there
[3:05:11] <MasterTonberry23> Just dont get hit, problem solved Kappa
[3:05:17] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah in arcade mode it would be a reset anyway
[3:05:20] <+chippracoon> I think the most enemy in the game would have to be Z
[3:05:29] <+chippracoon> op*
[3:05:32] <lufasamufasa> SPEEDRUNNING OUTCHEA.
[3:05:35] <Sedrelic> good
[3:05:37] <+warlockwithapixie> !uptime
[3:05:38] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 17 minutes
[3:05:42] <coreybom> @beezushrist Let em play dude. Where you any better?
[3:05:52] <+MisterRockett> Did anyone mention that when Pat played this game he just called Cherry "The Character Woolie Will Play."?
[3:06:18] <MasterTonberry23> Goddamn thicc ladies
[3:06:25] <coreybom> @misterrockett Pat knows woolie to a fucking T.
[3:06:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> TBF cherry is badass in general
[3:06:32] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> again this game is smart though, if one of you eats it immediately it will adjust the game
[3:06:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> si can you blame wollie
[3:06:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> woolie*
[3:06:54] <+TopTieramisu> you didn't have to eat it right away
[3:06:56] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> the patterns and scaling change, and the points system means you will likely get extra lives much faster
[3:07:04] <MasterTonberry23> I wish this game had more playable characters. As in, more new ones, not just ones from previous games
[3:07:13] <%SuperKirby24> @big_bang_blitz_ easy mode unlocked? Kappa
[3:07:16] <thesickestzak> I know they are saying it right, but all I hear is Carl Wheezer when they say croissant
[3:07:27] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> no it just scales appropriately, like every game should and none do
[3:07:28] <Brandon__Brando> I feel you woolie FeelsBadMan
[3:07:31] <+chippracoon> I'm happy I learn how to fight the biker girls early
[3:07:34] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> this game is REALLY well thought out
[3:07:39] <+ARoguishHam> man there's punished and then there's what you did to purple biker
[3:07:44] <+Estuko> @MasterTonberry23 I'm trying to remember but there wa a game that totally let you play as NPC enemies, a beat em up too
[3:07:47] <+ARoguishHam> she didn't see the ground for half a day
[3:07:51] <exileshadow03> LOL just a frigging gang stomping
[3:08:01] <+Jintais3rd> She's out on the streets
[3:08:03] <+xeros720> the strongest superpower
[3:08:04] <+Jintais3rd> She faced the rage
[3:08:04] <+xeros720> gun
[3:08:16] <MasterTonberry23> @Estuko Yeah, that Fatal Fury beat em up the best friends played a while back :P
[3:08:35] <+Estuko> @MasterTonberry23 there you go lmao, better memory than I

[3:08:48] <Saltmeisterr> the whole game lol
[3:08:48] <thesickestzak> Like 90% @appleberrykitty
[3:08:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> This is the end
[3:08:53] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> theres a lot of games that let you play as npc enemies. urban reign, guardians of teh hood
[3:08:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> they died
[3:09:00] <AppleBerryKitty> I...hate..my...life
[3:09:17] <andrei11dr> The vod is always there
[3:09:26] <KingVantq> poutine counter tdogRock

[3:09:31] <AppleBerryKitty> The vod makes me cry every time tho

[3:09:34] <%Kriss1827> watch the anime too tho
[3:09:40] <plushysceptile> Have they gotten any unlocks yet?
[3:09:41] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> oh BIG FIGHT in the Atlantic
[3:09:51] <+chippracoon> Z is stronf
[3:09:54] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> idk a bunch of games
[3:10:07] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you can
[3:10:11] <MasterTonberry23> I think this is gonna take a few tries
[3:10:14] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also he can defend himself when you do it
[3:10:23] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> so throw something at him and wail on him
[3:10:39] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yes at z
[3:10:44] <DXLelouch24> this is a REALLY BAD run
[3:10:50] <KgKid51> SourPls
[3:10:53] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> he grabs it from the air and you can beat the shit out of him
[3:11:04] <+chippracoon> I learn never jump at Z and throw stuff at him.
[3:11:10] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> it wont trigger his jump either
[3:11:17] <+TheOneCalledRock> this is a GAUNTLET
[3:11:40] <%Solidnick18> the big boys
[3:11:45] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> well yeah he gets the weapon, and you kill him
[3:11:45] <+prime_name> Is this the final level?
[3:11:45] <andrei11dr> This level is LOOOONG too
[3:11:48] <MasterTonberry23> This fatman room is a real health drain
[3:11:49] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> its a good trade
[3:11:50] <+TheOneCalledRock> wow they did not die from that
[3:11:51] <AppleBerryKitty> now that..was a 100% waste
[3:11:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> YOOOOOOO
[3:11:55] <8589brian> This may be my new favorite beat em up taking Vendetta off the top
[3:11:58] <+chippracoon> I learn that big boys will kill themselves with that ball
[3:11:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:12:42] <+TheOneCalledRock> @beezushrist i mean.....you can still say the level is lon
[3:12:48] <+TheOneCalledRock> long*
[3:12:52] <wrydiculous> hooo boy
[3:12:54] <%Daba_mk2> is going to be clutch
[3:12:55] <andrei11dr> @beezushrist Ive only played this and 3 actually
[3:12:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> CLUTCH IT
[3:13:01] <MasterTonberry23> This is gonna be an intel gathering round, because they are not gonna beat it on one life each :P
[3:13:02] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> its roughly as long as level 8 in sor
[3:13:02] <+Qsmash_> one stock one dream
[3:13:10] <+Ornightz> The games drawback is No Checkpoints AND No continues ...
[3:13:17] <+chippracoon> @theonecalledrock for me who played all the other SoR this one is kinda short.
[3:13:24] <AppleBerryKitty> Funny enough, they are not the only ones who said "we're doing worse" after they lost to the boss. a lot of people said the same thing i've notice.
[3:13:26] <MasterTonberry23> @Ornightz What do you mean? They have infinite continues
[3:13:31] <wrydiculous> checkpoints in my beat em up?
[3:13:33] <+TheOneCalledRock> @chippracoon fair enough
[3:13:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> CRAZY TALK
[3:13:59] <ofalconer> Use your specials to be invuln through her attack
[3:14:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SPREADING
[3:14:11] <wrydiculous> her charge stab is stupid easy to avoid
[3:14:17] <plushysceptile> Hanging at the bottom center of the screen is safe for the charge
[3:14:18] <lufasamufasa> Never play Just the Tip with Ms Y. She'll win every time.
[3:14:39] <+Ornightz> @MasterTonberry23 NO they DO Not You Lose You HAVE To do the STAGE from the Beginning
[3:14:39] <+chippracoon> man Idk if the game broke or I just learn to abuse her but I never had trouble with Ms. Y on her own.
[3:14:41] <Th3rd3> now eat the shuriken
[3:14:54] <EnlightenedKramer> yoo those HONKERS THOS
[3:15:02] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> mrs y just has no defense
[3:15:03] <+TopTieramisu> ms y isn't hard if you know what she does
[3:15:14] <MasterTonberry23> @Ornightz Theres no checkpoints, but they can continue as often as they want is what I mean
[3:15:16] <zamzoph> they gonna die
[3:15:17] <+chippracoon> @ornightz you would hate arcade mode.
[3:15:21] <+TopTieramisu> for example, the charge slash is a diagonal. easy to avoid when yo know the trajectory
[3:15:23] <wrydiculous> good fucking luck with only 1 stock
[3:15:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> one of the down side of trying to emulate your video game grandfathers is that long levels like this are rough without checkpoints
[3:15:37] <+Ornightz> @chippracoon I already do
[3:15:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> What if u damage Ms Y more that than Mr? Will she get in the mech? Might be easier @WoolieVersus
[3:15:48] <+Estuko> @TheOneCalledRock that's why I like that save state system lol
[3:15:53] <+TopTieramisu> @BallerSwagBro9k yes, eventually they both get in the mech
[3:15:53] <MasterTonberry23> Minh down!
[3:15:54] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yes she gest in the mech
[3:15:59] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> the mech is the same though
[3:16:01] <andrei11dr> One life, there's no way they're doing this
[3:16:03] <wrydiculous> @ballerswagbro9k hell no it isnt
[3:16:08] <MaxPainChaos> jsowKEK
[3:16:10] <%Daba_mk2> Don't get in there LUL
[3:16:14] <%paladinstarbuster> just restart
[3:16:14] <zamzoph> Guess you'll die
[3:16:17] <BallerSwagBro9k> @TopTieramisu Can u control who gets in 1st tho?
[3:16:21] <+Qsmash_> definitely deal with the human first
[3:16:21] <+Ether101_Prime> Got for Ms. Y or she'll get up there too.
[3:16:22] <+TopTieramisu> @BallerSwagBro9k damage
[3:16:31] <wrydiculous> because you will have to deal with both gun and mech
[3:16:31] <thesickestzak> Guess I'll just die then
[3:16:33] <MasterTonberry23> Nevermind trying to win, just figure out how the robot works so we can do better next time
[3:16:41] <+chippracoon> @theonecalledrock ok but I think they was more focused on the fans of the game then new people.
[3:16:43] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> also if you beat the mech whoever isnt in it will take it over
[3:16:49] <MaxPainChaos> LuvOops
[3:16:50] <MasterTonberry23> Okay, attempt 3
[3:16:52] <+xeros720> the combo of the two is real rough
[3:16:54] <+TopTieramisu> the first one to hit the treshold gets in the mech
[3:16:55] <TerrorRISK> Maybe swap Cherry for Axel?
[3:16:57] <Th3rd3> Assist me>
[3:17:00] <+xeros720> assist
[3:17:04] <BallerSwagBro9k> NEVER ASSITS
[3:17:04] <andrei11dr> Just don't stay in the middle too much

[3:17:22] <thesickestzak> EASY MODE
[3:17:23] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> theres also a whole blind spot
[3:17:24] <+Ornightz> MasterTonberry23 That's the problem The assist are at the cost of your Score This game is milking out How many times you have top play to unlock old school content they should not have done that tbh
[3:17:28] <+TopTieramisu> staying on the side trivializes the mech
[3:17:28] <%Jbulleit97> I say you get one more chance and then hold the L and take the assist.

[3:18:39] <+chippracoon> got to know your I frames in this game
[3:18:41] <MasterTonberry23> @mankeyfigh They start with lowered health
[3:18:44] <+Ether101_Prime> Fat guys just move up and down.
[3:18:44] <exileshadow03> You always get the third round focus after the second round rush
[3:18:46] <zamzoph> maybe dodge?
[3:18:49] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> I can cakewalk through sor2 mania but this game takes difficulty seriously
[3:18:52] <+Ether101_Prime> Throw more.
[3:18:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> @mankeyfigh they need to get as much health as possible
[3:19:08] <+Dr_DangerPhD> if someone plays axel and does his forward special fat boys get demolished

[3:19:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> THE FOUNDER
[3:19:54] <+Ornightz> I wish the game gave you continues like the old school ones and gave you boss checkpoints , they want you to be a perfectionist which can get very annoying a
[3:19:59] <Mrbaconator> THE POWER
[3:20:03] <+chippracoon> that ball does more dmg then what you guys do and they always hit the ball
[3:20:04] <%Jbulleit97> Blood for the blood pool.

[3:20:08] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Ornightz play arcade mode
[3:20:08] <andrei11dr> Rage is old shit
[3:20:09] <+Ether101_Prime> Either twin can get on the mech and if you deplete their health the other will get on.

[3:20:47] <%dOjOTron> the music slaps sooo hard
[3:20:57] <+TopTieramisu> the music is great
[3:20:59] <+TheOneCalledRock> did the originals have boss checkpoints? i can not remember
[3:20:59] <+Ornightz> @Dr_DangerPhD sigh , Watch my comments in the vod man.
[3:21:03] <%ekodrop> I mean, I never expected it to become what it has become
[3:21:04] <AppleBerryKitty> SOR 3 music was wack but I got used to it.
[3:21:06] <MasterTonberry23> @nintega010 It will probably be very subdued, I imagine by then all three of them will be totally mentally and physically drained
[3:21:07] <thesickestzak> Music is B I G good
[3:21:09] <+chippracoon> I love you can set the music to retro
[3:21:12] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> time to petition sega to get lizardcube and yuzo to do a new Shinobi
[3:21:19] <plushysceptile> No checkpoints in the original
[3:21:19] <MaxPainChaos> No
[3:21:23] <%ekodrop> it was supposed to just be a fun way to support the channel
[3:21:25] <%Kriss1827> Not me LOL
[3:21:26] <%JustYudha> Yes
[3:21:26] <%SuperKirby24> isnt there like a beats of rage

[3:21:32] <DXLelouch24> hell no
[3:21:34] <epsypepsy> Streets of Rage Remake enhanced all 3 soundtracks very well
[3:21:38] <+adimcorner> no, but I sympathize with them
[3:21:39] <%paladinstarbuster> THIS IS A CARNIVORE FANBASE
[3:21:50] <Ultra_Pancake> Been doing that Ring Fit.
[3:21:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> CONSUME FLESH LUL
[3:21:53] <$arcielardor> people are vegetarians because they can't hear broccoli scream
[3:21:54] <%JustYudha> Veggie isn't so bad
[3:22:01] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok but that projext X zone "Go Left" track tho
[3:22:07] <+chippracoon> I wish I could of played the game on arcade first before story.
[3:22:12] <%fetrigon> @WoolieVersus Have you tried Ring Fit Adventure?
[3:22:12] <+adimcorner> I do try to lessen my intake of meat.
[3:22:17] <%Gruhunchously> I don't mind vegetarians. They go well with spice and tofu.
[3:22:24] <andrei11dr> Humans are FACTUALLY omnivorous, why fuck with that?
[3:22:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> The Black Sheep you might say LUL
[3:22:38] <DXLelouch24> meat tastes too good, my tastebuds have HATED veggies since i threw up green beans as a child.Scarred by veggies for life quite liteally
[3:22:40] <+toastybites> knew a guy that didn't eat pork or fish
[3:22:42] <thesickestzak> Devilman Wooliebaby
[3:22:44] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> common grass has a smell when freshly cut because each blade of grass is releasing chemicals to wran the other grass of the danger
[3:22:51] <andrei11dr> I don't eat fish
[3:22:57] <+toastybites> apparently fish was "the pig of the sea"
[3:23:00] <+TheOneCalledRock> @chippracoon yeah i was a little disappointed that arcade was a unlock
[3:23:02] <+Estuko> A friend of mine tried to lift much more than I because he's a bigger person and I use "Women weights." He pulled a muscle and hurt himself, difference is I've been doing this for years. He just started because quarantine.
[3:23:04] <+LastHazzerd> that's cuz they're so damn stubborn
[3:23:24] <+adimcorner> but I can't quit meat because it let's me eat more with my diabetic diet
[3:23:34] <+LastHazzerd> TEMPTATION
[3:23:48] <%paladinstarbuster> When you watch what you eat and live actively and stress free youre good
[3:23:51] <%SuperKirby24> ! Maximum temptation!
[3:23:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> Religion is scary
[3:24:04] <+toastybites> @adimcorner is that like natural keto but worse
[3:24:11] <%psidefx> The lawd said the devil was attractive
[3:24:15] <%BinaryFireball> I learned the other day that the serpent is literally just a dick metaphor
[3:24:16] <+TheOneCalledRock> the devil is trying to seduce you with that sick as slab of steak

[3:25:37] <+MisterRockett> I'm still mad Roo is the only character missing. SHIVA got in but not my boy Roo.
[3:25:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> we must OBLITERATE the fat evil
[3:25:51] <SilentPredator03> bologna has the widest variance for quality. I've had really good bologna and really bad
[3:25:57] <MaxPainChaos> LuvOops
[3:26:00] <+Jintais3rd> Gotta perfect the run
[3:26:01] <%Jbulleit97> So I just finished beating the game solo on Normal mode, and it really seems like simply adding more characters makes the game harder.

[3:27:33] <Saltmeisterr> the classic galsia
[3:27:42] <+chippracoon> hell my worst stage in the game is China town
[3:27:43] <andrei11dr> This is manga exclusive content
[3:27:46] <%psidefx> the youtube illusion can easily be broken for talking about cuts its fine
[3:28:02] <+bupkisoffthechain> Pepega
[3:28:03] <thesickestzak> Manga filler lol
[3:28:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> the cuts in the anime are translator edits
[3:28:34] <+badjab326> You can dodge her headbutt with neutral jump
[3:28:45] <%SomersaultJustice> this rmika wall
[3:28:46] <+Qsmash_> this is the situational awareness you have to build up to win
[3:28:48] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah neutral jumps just avoid them
[3:28:49] <odd_slater> Yea I wanna get this game
[3:28:58] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> its 22 bucks atm
[3:29:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> @odd_slater it's free if you got xbox game pass
[3:29:06] <andrei11dr> They're just not neutral jumpin enough
[3:29:09] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> or if you spend a dollar on gamepass
[3:29:21] <+TheOneCalledRock> well... "free"
[3:29:25] <+TheOneCalledRock> lmao
[3:29:28] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> you can get a gamepass subscription in a box of pop-tarts
[3:29:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> but game pass is legit
[3:29:33] <odd_slater> On PC gamepass too?
[3:29:33] <+chippracoon> its on Xbox Game pass, that's how I'm playing it
[3:29:37] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yes
[3:29:42] <MasterTonberry23> Tigaa knee
[3:29:56] <SilentPredator03> Not respecting the invincibility on wake up for the muay thai guys
[3:30:06] <+TheOneCalledRock> game pass also has yakuza 0 and kiwami
[3:30:06] <Tuna_Can_0> SourPls
[3:30:07] <MasterTonberry23> Those muay thai guys were always jerkoffs even in the original
[3:30:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> get in there
[3:30:09] <+chippracoon> I would use a star in the mob room
[3:30:21] <KnightAsteran> that was some fuckin Castle Crashers music back there
[3:30:24] <AppleBerryKitty> that was a trap for the mobs
[3:30:24] <fangovafang> yaa
[3:30:28] <wrydiculous> bruh they wasted the chandelier
[3:30:38] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah stars sarent too useful against the bosses since specials arent really needed
[3:30:43] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> cant combo the mech
[3:30:51] <+chippracoon> there not bad if your looking for them.
[3:30:51] <fangovafang> damn yall cuda used dat chandelier
[3:30:57] <%Solidnick18> goddamn
[3:31:00] <+TheOneCalledRock> the knife guys were recreated just like in the originals
[3:31:09] <+chippracoon> my most rage in the game is Z...
[3:31:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> for better or for worse OpieOP
[3:31:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> PSA Pat goes live in 15 min with P5

[3:32:18] <thesickestzak> CWASON
[3:32:20] <%Solidnick18> they aren't playing around
[3:32:21] <wrydiculous> the robot guys are a hard lesson that they too can grab shit thats thrown at em
[3:32:26] <+chippracoon> Baaabo is a fun guy I think ><
[3:32:29] <MasterTonberry23> And that wasnt even the hardest room
[3:32:39] <crossing_mao> Crozon
[3:32:40] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah but when teh robot grabs it you can ewaack him
[3:32:48] <Saltmeisterr> @beezushrist ok and?
[3:32:48] <%xpakeo> xpakeo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Hey Woolz, I made you a special review on my previously purchased N-Word pass, i DMed you on twitter if your interested on reading it. Anyways thank you, Minh, and good old Reginald for the amazing content! Stay awesome and stay safe!
[3:32:57] <+TheOneCalledRock> @thesickestzak you are minding your own business pounding some dudes face in and some jobber just jams a knife in your back Kappa
[3:33:10] <+chippracoon> am I the only guy think the shadow men are a odd thing to add in the last stage?
[3:33:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:33:12] <Saltmeisterr> damn guys guess i suck
[3:33:15] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:33:16] <MasterTonberry23> "I can lose a bit more life" (immediately gets hit)
[3:33:22] <+LastHazzerd> those HUGE balls expose your own
[3:33:29] <%Kriss1827> @beezushrist chill my dude
[3:33:38] <TheMorilo> This is stressful
[3:33:40] <+LastHazzerd> it's the Fat room!
[3:33:40] <AppleBerryKitty> Hope in mania the ninjas show up more often.
[3:33:44] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> this part is just kinda funny because they will all kill themselves
[3:33:47] <MasterTonberry23> Are they on normal or hard?
[3:33:48] <%xpakeo> !uptime
[3:33:49] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 45 minutes
[3:33:54] <wrydiculous> normal
[3:34:04] <Th3rd3> protect Woolie
[3:34:06] <MasterTonberry23> @wrydiculous thank ye
[3:34:07] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Saltmeisterr promise nothing, deliver less
[3:34:16] <+chippracoon> I want more shadow men, just with they was in more stages
[3:34:17] <MasterTonberry23> Well you guys are doing...slightly better?
[3:34:23] <wrydiculous> if it was hard they would be stuck on stage 6 at worst
[3:34:34] <AppleBerryKitty> @chippracoon same
[3:34:35] <andrei11dr> Still no life's tho
[3:34:39] <Saltmeisterr> @TheOneCalledRock ???
[3:34:39] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah the first 5 levels are open by default
[3:34:41] <+Jintais3rd> Better top off before you pop off
[3:34:42] <NekoZen> omg let cherry get the points for extra stock
[3:34:54] <thesickestzak> @beezushrist just want to say you seem like a super cool guy. Can't wait for your 100% expert stream of the game my dude. 4Head
[3:34:55] <fangovafang> she low key easy
[3:34:58] <+chippracoon> man China Town is a make or brake for hard or higher
[3:35:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Saltmeisterr old Super Best Friends quote
[3:35:14] <+ChaosEmralds> i dont think they know getting points means getting extra lives
[3:35:32] <%Kriss1827> @theonecalledrock the best quote
[3:35:34] <AppleBerryKitty> dont when you grab and slam mobs they give 200/4 points or is that not in 4?
[3:35:43] <Saltmeisterr> yeah but why u bringing out the quote?
[3:35:48] <%xpakeo> @thesickestzak same man! im super excited for the detailed playthrough on youtube that describes his every motion and why your wrong
[3:36:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> about you reply about how the dude said you suck
[3:36:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> your
[3:36:14] <Saltmeisterr> oh lol
[3:36:16] <+chippracoon> I think when you get grab you can just wiggle out right?
[3:36:28] <+Jaysky> The Y family are innocent, why are we attacking them again?
[3:36:29] <wrydiculous> not her grabs
[3:36:40] <+chippracoon> ok
[3:36:41] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> that rushing beat knee just works
[3:36:42] <Th3rd3> phew
[3:36:51] <wrydiculous> iirc only the green and red coo grabs can be wiggled out
[3:36:51] <Saltmeisterr> i kinda thought u where u talking about woolie and the gang LUL
[3:37:01] <%xpakeo> i did too tbh
[3:37:14] <wrydiculous> cops*
[3:37:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> i mean the dude was saying that say suck too so it still works in that context LUL
[3:37:40] <+prime_name> Mr.Y wigging out there
[3:37:47] <exploitativity2> go away
[3:37:49] <MarsKirisame> is that the guy from devilman crybaby with the coat
[3:38:00] <wrydiculous> stay left
[3:38:09] <Tuna_Can_0> @beezushrist maybe whine some more, im sure that'll get what you want
[3:38:10] <andrei11dr> He dose kinda look like Satan
[3:38:13] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> shes not dangerous though
[3:38:23] <namisrot> it looks like a robo orchid mantis
[3:38:31] <+chippracoon> I didn't know that when you kill Mr Y before Ms Y, she gets on the mec
[3:38:37] <Tuna_Can_0> @beezushrist BabyRage
[3:38:44] <MasterTonberry23> The real problem is that Ms Y runs interference making it harder to focus on the mech
[3:38:58] <+Estuko> Yeah Beezus has been doing nothing but crying tbh lol just get the game and play it then dude
[3:39:00] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah and if they knock mr y of fthe mech now, mrs y will get in it
[3:39:02] <wrydiculous> i always take out ms y
[3:39:10] <+tigerfang86> @beezushrist you suck ass dude
[3:39:10] <plushysceptile> It beats having Mr.Y out of the mech because of his guns and grenades
[3:39:21] <exploitativity2> @beezushrist nobody here likes you. be quiet or go away. why do you keep talking?
[3:39:26] <Tuna_Can_0> @beezushrist cute
[3:39:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> @legacy0117 tbh having a giant metal robot thing is a solid back up plan in case your plan fails LUL
[3:39:32] <%Kriss1827> @beezushrist chill out dude just enjoy complaining aint getting you nowhere
[3:39:38] <+sunsetserenity1> @beezushrist Dude... why are you like this, what happened?

[3:39:41] <+chippracoon> there going to be in a shocker soon lol
[3:39:41] <exploitativity2> I don't care. Go away.
[3:39:56] <exploitativity2> do you act like this in real life?
[3:39:58] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> ok so that part wher eI said she takes the mech comes into play now
[3:39:59] <%Solidnick18> He's down

[3:51:27] <%nintega010> Abigail
[3:51:27] <%SomersaultJustice> lucia was fun in sfv
[3:51:28] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> if Street Fighter V had Dean it would've worked
[3:51:35] <%Solidnick18> that's it
[3:51:41] <andrei11dr> Abigail is the worst tho
[3:51:41] <%COMB711> Dean is the key to all of this
[3:51:50] <%SomersaultJustice> NO
[3:51:56] <+chippracoon> but sadly i think final fight is dead for street fighter
[3:51:56] <+TopTieramisu> if capcom makes it, it will definitely not be in 2D
[3:51:56] <+Ether101_Prime> Bring back all the playable characters.
[3:51:58] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> yeah switch abigail with Dean and POOF history changes
[3:52:02] <TerrorRISK> A redone Kyle could be cool.

[3:54:21] <+solzan2000> Roxy
[3:54:22] <Josef_Stryker> Roxy?
[3:54:25] <+snackcanary> her sister
[3:54:26] <TerrorRISK> Roxy
[3:54:27] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> like yamazki
[3:54:28] <%paladinstarbuster> Matts rats
[3:54:30] <%doombawkzvs> Roxy
[3:54:31] <%SomersaultJustice> I wanted them to add Roxy with the bat in SFv
[3:54:37] <+Ether101_Prime> Roxy is working with Abigail.
[3:54:39] <bazz_tv> capcom hasn't made a new beat em up in years
[3:54:50] <%COMB711> Bring back Max and Scott
[3:54:51] <+solzan2000> that would be cool
[3:54:53] <+solzan2000> Akuma
[3:54:56] <+Jintais3rd> Captain Commando tbh
[3:54:59] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> make a Ryu walking sim, i'd play that
[3:54:59] <bazz_tv> was Streetwise the last capcom beat em up?
[3:55:05] <%generalve> why doesnt Capcom just pull the trigger on poison ? why do they constantly pull a "will they , wont they"
[3:55:07] <plushysceptile> One final case of Sega does what Nintendon't
[3:55:08] <andrei11dr> Clearly nobody ever listened to Matt, they all just pretended LUL
[3:55:12] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> walk towards the sun, walk under the waterfall
[3:55:18] <%jiggy_snipe> Akuma would do it
[3:55:20] <%paladinstarbuster> the you can get more chun costumes
[3:55:24] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> walk into the semi truck
[3:55:29] <+Ether101_Prime> Ryu would because he needs to deal with shit like that.
[3:55:29] <%Solidnick18> yes
[3:55:34] <+FairOnFire> Fucking yes
[3:55:35] <%doombawkzvs> Ken would if they’re in his family’s neighborhood
[3:55:36] <mr_sups> I think they should do a Super Beat 'em up. Combine all the Beat 'em ups into one game
[3:55:54] <%COMB711> Not a popular pic but I think ed's moveset would transition really well to a beat-em-up
[3:55:55] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> if isekai animes can do it, sure why not
[3:56:03] <bazz_tv> because @generalve , they don't want to ruin her appeal to guys who are not into it
[3:56:04] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> just sor x final fight x rushing beat
[3:56:13] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok but when will cyber akuma and sunburned sakura come back?
