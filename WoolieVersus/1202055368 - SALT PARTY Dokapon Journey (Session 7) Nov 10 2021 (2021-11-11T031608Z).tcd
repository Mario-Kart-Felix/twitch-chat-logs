[0:12:13] <%emMmDeeKay> Someone is probably doing it for free right now
[0:12:14] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> No shame whatsoever
[0:12:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie this ain't a bit, this is his LIFE
[0:12:15] <%Vigonept> its 100$
[0:12:18] <%Orcapugs> No black light please
[0:12:26] <%ChoculaUltra> no, Minh has the scrap of Death Note paper behind the portrait
[0:12:29] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie's a hater D:
[0:12:42] <+vaderxyz1970> Live character assasination
[0:12:44] <%MajorCrasher> woolie is a hater smh
[0:12:59] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Woolie is exhausted to his core lol
[0:13:03] <%Vigonept> booooo
[0:13:04] <dds333a> he needs to know LUL
[0:13:06] <%topendbuzza> no desk means no kb it's not hard
[0:13:07] <%thesickestzak> Ugh
[0:13:08] <hawmaro95> Woolie hating on the Dokage
[0:13:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> BTW, Minh is noticeably unfocused on Camera.
[0:13:19] <SlangPunk> Let the man play how he wants jesus
[0:13:22] <+Jiggisnipe> it was pretty obvious that he didn't have a desk so he didn't want a keyboard for DD
[0:13:24] <JetpackMcQuack> fuck fightsticks, i hate them
[0:13:31] <%thesickestzak> This sucks that woolie has to go over this so much
[0:13:34] <@Menitta> it's the most "I prefer x" "so you hate y?"
[0:13:38] <%Orcapugs> Cube needed
[0:13:46] <+EdenOfLove> Someone clip this for the next guy
[0:13:51] <ashenjuan25> Woolie ain‚Äôt wrong
[0:13:56] <+BignanasTheGawd> not even minesweeper?
[0:13:58] <dds333a> machete man really studying up
[0:13:59] <solardx101> its woolie time to return to first place
[0:14:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> This clip should play at the start of every stream to just nip it in the bud.
[0:14:05] <ashenjuan25> Keyboards ain‚Äôt meant for gaming it‚Äôs meant for typing
[0:14:06] <SlangPunk> @orcapugs Ah yes, the gamer highchair
[0:14:11] <%emMmDeeKay> FFS, this came up on the podcast on monday that guy is an idiot. woolieONEGUY
[0:14:18] <@Solidus_113> BPM
[0:14:24] <dds333a> @ashenjuan25 it works, but I can use both
[0:14:26] <+RyTYoung> Never be M+Kboard and controller hybrid
[0:14:26] <ashenjuan25> The only benefit of keyboard and mouse is the mouse the keyboard can go
[0:14:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @emMmDeeKay TBF, not everyone consumes ALL content.
[0:14:36] <+vaderxyz1970> Guys I think Woolies trying too tell us something
[0:14:36] <turboyabo> yeah that makes sense
[0:14:43] <+Jiggisnipe> an arcade stick for instance Kappa
[0:14:43] <+eanscrale> if you were poor enough you had to share the keyboard with your siblings to play the same arcade rom
[0:14:43] <hawmaro95> Half Life 2 when?
[0:15:01] <ashenjuan25> Poor people didn‚Äôt have PCs
[0:15:03] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Lol Woolie still did it
[0:15:06] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Fuck yeah
[0:15:09] <%thesickestzak> Make a !keyboard command at this point lol
[0:15:14] <ashenjuan25> They only had the last generation‚Äôs consoles
[0:15:16] <dds333a> @eanscrale I always had wasd, and my bro had directional LUL
[0:15:21] <hawmaro95> Yeah soccer is actually fun LUL
[0:15:31] <dds333a> my little bro would always switch
[0:15:34] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> DoritosChip
[0:15:41] <$Invlux> the wagon is cute, but less cute after 300 hours
[0:15:41] <%topendbuzza> some people couch play pc.. it's not hard
[0:15:44] <%ChoculaUltra> my bro made me learn how to play X-Men Children of the Atom on a keyboard on some Kung Pow shit.
[0:15:59] <+eanscrale> @dds333a The real killer was that the usually couldn't hand le more than three to five keys pressed at once.
[0:16:23] <+saltpiggu> also its good for accessibility anyway
[0:16:25] <%Irridium> should clip this and throw it on youtube so you can just link to it
[0:16:25] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:16:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Play it at the start of every Stream
[0:16:33] <dds333a> nah, say it again
[0:16:34] <+blazingsaddles_mongo> blazingsaddles_mongo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:16:36] <@Solidus_113> why no keyboard tho
[0:16:39] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> BLOOD AND SALT
[0:16:40] <@Menitta> I kinda like the controller keyboard hybrid
[0:16:42] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:16:48] <SlangPunk> I was super lucky my musician background let me apart to keyboard games when I finally built my PC a few years ago, but a lot of people won't get that
[0:17:05] <Equirah> WoolieVS - Why keyboards suck | 1:15:37
[0:17:06] <%thesickestzak> Hold on I didn‚Äôt hear it this time. Gotta explain again please. This has only been like the 100th time
[0:17:08] <JetpackMcQuack> hybrid is best
[0:17:12] <%Solidnick18> i feel ya woolie
[0:17:17] <%baka_sugoi> words are HARD
[0:17:20] <@Solidus_113> ADAPT OR DIE
[0:17:25] <dds333a> come on wool, seriously Kappa
[0:17:27] <theredfox930000> I suck with keyboard
[0:17:27] <%nintega010> reason why im ok with league
[0:17:27] <+vaderxyz1970> FF14 being made for controller is the best
[0:17:39] <@Menitta> I vastly prefer to play Titanfall 2 with a controller and when I can still carry even on pc with that, I'm good.
[0:17:42] <%ChoculaUltra> "just adapt, 5head"
[0:17:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> speaking of adapting...I feel like Minh's cam isn't supposed to be 240p
[0:17:53] <%blazingsaddles_mongo> I 1000% support Woolie's ongoing journey for the ultimate input device
[0:17:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dokage is a tad unfocused on camera btw
[0:18:00] <%Solidnick18> dokapon
[0:18:03] <dds333a> I can't text very fast either, then again I also have huge fingers
[0:18:11] <%topendbuzza> five guys?
[0:18:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:18:20] <dds333a> relative to the. board
[0:18:22] <%MajorCrasher> FF14 is usable on controller but man I hate it. I much prefer the quick functionality the m+kb offers
[0:18:22] <+vaderxyz1970> @topendbuzza Burgers
[0:18:27] <ronin19xx> @topendbuzza I want a burger now
[0:18:31] <theredfox930000> the boys are back atpDance atpDance majinoNeko majinoNeko
[0:18:35] <SlangPunk> @dds333a Same  but in my case I trip up over myself typing out stuff LUL
[0:18:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat doesn't have a foot to stand on, either because he keeps yelling at that one dev on Twitter to give games controller support and the dev goes "lul".
[0:18:46] <kikoeru_san> I wonder if Woolie got the Kirby Gunpla?
[0:18:47] <%blazingsaddles_mongo> Titanfall 2 spoiled you on the input modifications you could make to stick sensitivity
[0:18:51] <%ChoculaUltra> been meaning to ask - is Dokapon capped at 3 players for a multiplayer game or can it go up to 4?

[0:23:23] <%X2Eliah> Minh Winning. Minhning.
[0:23:26] <%topendbuzza> minh is a beast in battle
[0:23:34] <royb2> born of salt and smoke
[0:23:36] <royb2> is he a ham?
[0:23:43] <dds333a> Their options are either consecutive initiatives to outdamage him
[0:23:55] <%X2Eliah> @royb2 Minh is Azor Ahai reborn
[0:23:57] <dds333a> get better option to potentially ohko him
[0:24:03] <ronin19xx> Was the music always this loud compared to thier mics?
[0:24:09] <dds333a> or shut down his options
[0:24:09] <Lancaster_H> @dds333a reggie could also legit fuck him up with field magic
[0:24:12] <TTouchdown> If monsters start using their spells, Minh is screwed
[0:24:13] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @dds333a won't that not work cuz he can just bless up on defense?
[0:24:14] <ronin19xx> Their*
[0:24:20] <%blazingsaddles_mongo> mobility is woolies one remaining resource
[0:24:27] <%MajorCrasher> @dds333a they literally have to disable him or one shot kill. he can come back from anything else
[0:24:30] <%X2Eliah> @blazingsaddles_mongo And salt
[0:24:35] <dds333a> @reverend_roscoe hence why I provided three scenarios

[0:25:08] <dds333a> @majorcrasher even with mutiple initiatives, they could outdamage the healing, but that requires tons of luck

[0:26:02] <%X2Eliah> Ok for real Minh might be winning this but Kinks has some chance still
[0:26:05] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe the big monster does more messed things the longer the game goes

[0:33:05] <dds333a> should've played better
[0:33:13] <hawmaro95> STRIKE!
[0:33:16] <TTouchdown> I am unreasonably salty that ‚Äúalways strike and counter‚Äù is the best strategy
[0:33:20] <+heros_lucatero> weskJammin weskWiggle
[0:33:20] <+Dustwalker44> It is so weird seeing the game reflected back above Reggies head. lol

[0:33:42] <HentaiIsloveAH> so what did i miss i was streaming i couldn't watch the stream
[0:33:44] <QueequegTheater> I'm hoping for another "Threatening to lose is the right play"
[0:33:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh knows from experience Kappa
[0:34:04] <+heros_lucatero> yep üêì
[0:34:06] <dds333a> @djazo not too much
[0:34:08] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @djazo reggie got bodied, woolie took a shit
[0:34:11] <QueequegTheater> yep cum
[0:34:12] <%blazingsaddles_mongo> the question is: will Woolie's breaking point give him a positive or negative affliction?
[0:34:12] <+Reverend_Roscoe> that's it
[0:34:19] <+vaderxyz1970> snek
[0:34:19] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> @djazo Minh brought his waifu for good luck
[0:34:35] <ronin19xx> Yo Woolz, game audio is a little louder than your mics
[0:34:38] <Lancaster_H> game is a little too loud @WoolieVersus
[0:34:53] <HentaiIsloveAH> @dds333a @Reverend_Roscoe seems like a lot of stuff happened Kappa

[0:36:34] <%notsoy> Choo Chooo HypeSleep
[0:36:35] <ronin19xx> We now understand Minhs euphoric feeling of escaping the games theme
[0:36:42] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Infinite hp
[0:36:48] <TTouchdown> Enemies just never counter Minh, huh?

[0:36:57] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> these foolish hopes

[0:36:59] <dds333a> @ttouchdown rarely
[0:37:03] <%topendbuzza> correct
[0:37:07] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Dokage ftw SeemsGood
[0:37:12] <+paladinstarbuster> correct
[0:37:12] <TTouchdown> Only once all last session
[0:37:13] <dds333a> cripple him
[0:37:14] <%topendbuzza> coma and crap
[0:37:18] <glass_marcus> Zone him out
[0:37:21] <+eanscrale> Hope is the bitter fertilizer from which disappointment blooms
[0:37:21] <royb2> doesnt really matter if they did because minh wont die and will just swap the next turn
[0:37:26] <%MajorCrasher> @ttouchdown they do sometimes but it doesn't matter. he has so much up that he can tank it
[0:37:32] <+paladinstarbuster> That is what those items exist for
[0:37:33] <dds333a> can't take him in a straight fight it will never end LUL
[0:37:36] <%MajorCrasher> hp*
[0:37:40] <HentaiIsloveAH> lame it out like cross tekken
[0:37:47] <TTouchdown> Out of 50 strikes last time, he was countered once
[0:38:00] <dds333a> always pockets
[0:38:04] <%Solidnick18> always
[0:38:04] <+Jiggisnipe> Event Magnet Pockets
[0:38:12] <TTouchdown> So why did Woolie get countered constantly?
[0:38:17] <dds333a> it HAS to be P1 privilege
[0:38:21] <%topendbuzza> BIG BO
[0:38:23] <glass_marcus> because he's woolie
[0:38:32] <dds333a> @ttouchdown Dokapon stickshamChaos
[0:38:35] <ronin19xx> Bo is Inside
[0:38:45] <%MajorCrasher> @ttouchdown because he's Woolie
[0:38:54] <nechallenger> MINH IS IN FIRST??? WHAT HAPPENED
[0:38:54] <%X2Eliah> Bo is all of us
[0:38:55] <dds333a> the other guys have gotten it, but extremely rarely
[0:39:01] <+wynnewake> I trust in Mr Gutz
[0:39:09] <dds333a> Gutz LUL
[0:39:14] <%MajorCrasher> @nechallenger a lot happened LUL
[0:39:16] <%topendbuzza> must be a carry over from playing vs ai
[0:39:17] <+Jiggisnipe> man that Gutz thing was awful
[0:39:17] <royb2> Fuck gutz
[0:39:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:39:26] <+wynnewake> it has to be broken to some degree
[0:39:27] <OldManDeckardCain> how does it feel to have the event privilege, woolie? Kappa
[0:39:32] <glass_marcus> The AI Minh fights is so stupid, why would they use magic defense
[0:39:33] <dds333a> it's just P1
[0:39:38] <TTouchdown> No counters again
[0:39:38] <Qsmash_> Woolie actually thinks the game hates him
[0:39:40] <HentaiIsloveAH> @wynnewake he already stole his money and didn't make the sword LUL
[0:39:46] <ronin19xx> Imagine Reggies lucky rolls as Darkling
[0:39:56] <+wynnewake> @djazo have faith..
[0:40:03] <+vaderxyz1970> This is why I love Randy from Rimworld hes pure rng
[0:40:07] <TTouchdown> It might. The AI throws like crazy for Minh
[0:40:27] <%MajorCrasher> counters still don't matter to Minh LUL @ttouchdown
[0:40:32] <HentaiIsloveAH> @wynnewake faith in what he he already told woolie he is not making the sword LUL LUL
[0:40:35] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:40:56] <%andrewofbob> Steal the package and die?
[0:40:56] <TTouchdown> It at least delays him by turns. The monsters also never use spells on him
[0:41:01] <%topendbuzza> minh can just play brain dead in fights
[0:41:05] <dds333a> @royb2 at least the swap play is predictable, but that's precisely the mindgame LUL
[0:41:24] <%MajorCrasher> they rarely use spells in general tbh
[0:41:50] <ronin19xx> Amazing roll
[0:42:00] <TTouchdown> Certain monster AIs cast, but not against Minh
[0:42:29] <%Solidnick18> you need some grinding
[0:42:32] <dds333a> @ttouchdown he got countered twice, that's it
[0:42:41] <%X2Eliah> every time you shop is a time you dont fight and dont level up
[0:42:45] <+hoenhime344> minh is my god... my dokkage
[0:42:51] <dds333a> who fucking knows
[0:42:55] <TTouchdown> Twice in, like, 100 strikes
[0:42:58] <%topendbuzza> Eff is minh noone wants to go near him
[0:43:02] <%MajorCrasher> I mean if you think the game is being nice to Minh you should have seen Reggie the last 2 sessions lmao
[0:43:11] <dds333a> optional mission at that
[0:43:23] <%Solidnick18> chest
[0:43:25] <dds333a> that was to catch that little imp for the king
[0:43:28] <TTouchdown> Reggie gets good rolls, Minh gets good battles
[0:43:36] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL event
[0:43:39] <+hoenhime344> minh has gon through real strife, he clawed his way to god hood.
[0:43:50] <TTouchdown> Woolie gets shit on
[0:43:58] <+hoenhime344> woolie over thinks things
[0:44:05] <%MajorCrasher> he's died plenty tho. he has good battles now because he made a good build and has good gear now
[0:44:34] <%topendbuzza> the great crash
[0:44:42] <+hoenhime344> look at him doo dooing the music
[0:44:51] <dds333a> Reggie could be the most dangerous player if he tweaked his build a bit. albeit predictable LUL
[0:44:51] <+hoenhime344> i rememebr last week they were cursing it
[0:44:58] <TTouchdown> Ironically, the early enemies seemed to have more varied strategies
[0:45:00] <%topendbuzza> noone has many towns
[0:45:20] <dds333a> @topendbuzza thanks to the boss last time
[0:45:42] <sendart> darkling just seems to suck lol
[0:45:48] <%topendbuzza> the boss reset
[0:46:09] <TTouchdown> No point in Darkling when the whole map was just reset
[0:46:09] <+hoenhime344> kingdom darkling was WAY cooler
[0:46:24] <dds333a> @sendart it's only advantage is that it lasts weeks at a time LUL
[0:46:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:46:33] <+hoenhime344> how did the map get reset btw? i wasent here
[0:46:37] <%MajorCrasher> yeah darkling blows in this game. it's just temporary battle power and possible town resets if you get good rolls
[0:46:42] <%topendbuzza> the boss did it
[0:46:46] <+hoenhime344> ah ty
[0:46:52] <+paladinstarbuster> darkling in this game best suited for denying specific towns and reseting unprepared opponents
[0:46:58] <HotSauceFiend> the darkling in this game good to get rid of players equipment if you can beat them in battle
[0:47:10] <kikoeru_san> YOU CAN STILL WATCH IT BRO
[0:47:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Demona was my first crush
[0:47:38] <%topendbuzza> dont reg
[0:47:52] <DontChuckle98> This Mario Party Superstars stream lookin really intense.
[0:47:53] <dds333a> you can't turn right now anyway no?
[0:47:53] <%RaveBV> LUL
[0:48:02] <Teradyne87> It was no Batman Animated Series, but Gargoyle was pretty good
[0:48:05] <TTouchdown> Fling!
[0:48:08] <%topendbuzza> dont even have the bat
[0:48:16] <dds333a> @teradyne87 truth
[0:48:22] <+paladinstarbuster> Youre denying youre opponents progression
[0:48:44] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Mario Party Superstars where Pat comes in as the 4th would be peak salt
[0:48:44] <HotSauceFiend> lol landed in salt
[0:49:12] <+paladinstarbuster> 702 is nice

[0:49:32] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Good job Moobot!
[0:49:49] <dds333a> imagine the power jab ohko
[0:49:53] <%X2Eliah> When are the one-hit-kill monsters coming?
[0:49:56] <+hoenhime344> i want him to start pumping speed again
[0:50:02] <%Solidnick18> you guys are screwed LUL
[0:50:09] <TTouchdown> Not a single counter in sight
[0:50:12] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:14] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:18] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:24] <brunoberserk> can you change classes in this game , like in kingdom ?
[0:50:28] <%topendbuzza> turns out minh was the hero the whole time
[0:50:30] <+paladinstarbuster> you can stop him by just taking his weapon tho all his other stats suck
[0:50:35] <%MajorCrasher> nope @brunoberserk
[0:50:36] <dds333a> @brunoberserk don think so
[0:50:36] <NeroInfinite> nah no class changes here
[0:50:38] <user_naim> It‚Äôs not like the rest of them can‚Äôt start leveling hp right?
[0:50:39] <glass_marcus> no class changing
[0:50:54] <%MajorCrasher> @paladinstarbuster you'd have to kill him in battle first
[0:50:55] <TTouchdown> They didn‚Äôt want to take his weapon last time for some reason
[0:50:57] <%X2Eliah> @user_naim yeah but its then a game of pure catching up
[0:51:00] <dds333a> @user_naim they could, but they don't lend themselves to it as much
[0:51:02] <+hoenhime344> why is reggies weapon SO BADASS
[0:51:02] <glass_marcus> HP is not as valuable for them as it is for minh
[0:51:16] <dds333a> Reg did put his last level in HP. tho
[0:51:30] <HotSauceFiend> so isn't swap just deadly for minh then?
[0:51:45] <iggeh> anything interesting happen this session?
[0:51:56] <+hoenhime344> that is why i think minh needs to start pumping speed
[0:52:00] <dds333a> @hotsaucefiend it could get him out of a jam. and it's an excellent mindgame
[0:52:01] <Lancaster_H> man this tank meta is much more boring than the speed meta in Kingdom honestly
[0:52:05] <%X2Eliah> @iggeh Reggie died, woolie took a pee while streaming, and thats about it
[0:52:09] <+paladinstarbuster> @MajorCrasher its easy he has no magic defence that isnt in his passive you can just pelt him with magic and jump him
[0:52:12] <TTouchdown> They could have stopped Minh if they took his weapon when they had the chance
[0:52:23] <%MajorCrasher> Minh's been pumping all his stats into HP for like 40 levels while they haven't. they won't catch up even if they start now
[0:52:25] <dds333a> for reggie LUL LUL
[0:52:35] <%topendbuzza> out of battle magic is the play for kicks
[0:52:36] <%X2Eliah> btw, was Kingdom a more recent game?
[0:52:42] <brunoberserk> Strikemaster Minh
[0:52:43] <%X2Eliah> or is this one newer?
[0:52:47] <TTouchdown> They should be pumping their magic and attack
[0:52:50] <+RyTYoung> @x2eliah yeah this is originally snes
[0:52:54] <dds333a> @x2eliah in the sense of remaking a more recent game
[0:52:55] <+hoenhime344> remember the dokkage with alchemist? making money and duping items
[0:52:59] <%X2Eliah> @RyTYoung ohhh ok
[0:52:59] <user_naim> Okay I take it back, Minh is parctically Souther
[0:53:03] <HotSauceFiend> oh no, back to scared reggie
[0:53:07] <SuperCJK333> Reggie boost up some attack please
[0:53:08] <dds333a> this game is a remake of the first
[0:53:19] <brunoberserk> ONE FEAR
[0:53:22] <+hoenhime344> BEG
[0:53:25] <+hoenhime344> REGGIE BEG
[0:53:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:53:26] <SuperCJK333> You need a some beef in the muscles
[0:53:31] <%X2Eliah> That explains why there's fewer mechanics and less options for darkling, then.
[0:53:33] <%MajorCrasher> @paladinstarbuster Reggie already tried that. field magic barely does anything due to his class passive and the battle magic doesn't one shot so he can just heal all the damage every turn
[0:53:36] <galilafigala> They made a grave mistake underestimating the First
[0:53:45] <spacecatstreams> wuli
[0:53:51] <user_naim> @galilafigala damn right they did
[0:54:01] <TTouchdown> Sap is still a bitch though
[0:54:07] <+hoenhime344> hope
[0:54:15] <+hoenhime344> my dokkage knows all
[0:54:19] <dds333a> woolie knows LUL
[0:54:26] <Lancaster_H> they basically HAVE to go class cannon at this point
[0:54:28] <ronin19xx> Play to your strengths
[0:54:30] <Lancaster_H> glass*
[0:54:30] <%andrewofbob> Reggie is safe as long as he stays out of Minh's sight
[0:54:39] <+Jiggisnipe> average Kappa
[0:54:52] <dds333a> full coverage, average
[0:55:02] <user_naim> I guess you can‚Äôt really take his health away either. Shields and weapons can be stolen, but his hp is just innate power
[0:55:03] <%topendbuzza> forget about eff
[0:55:11] <%MajorCrasher> yep
[0:55:17] <+paladinstarbuster> @MajorCrasher he has not tryied it seriously at all and when doing so hasnt buffed his speed so it garuntees it to hit and he cant use his passive to heal out of battle
[0:55:34] <TTouchdown> Like 5 spaces
[0:55:46] <dds333a> @paladinstarbuster but his passive does increase his survivability to field magic
[0:55:54] <dds333a> by how much, I dunno
[0:56:02] <%MajorCrasher> @paladinstarbuster he did, he used bolt and meteor on him and it did like 5 damage each
[0:56:03] <brunoberserk> '' leave Jiren to me '' - Minh
[0:56:13] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie should get more magic
[0:56:15] <+paladinstarbuster> @dds333a not by alot it doesnt invalidate its usage
[0:56:16] <%X2Eliah> jeeez reggie's at is crazy low
[0:56:21] <TTouchdown> Only field magic that does damage. Debuffs aren‚Äôt defended against
[0:56:30] <Equirah> @X2Eliah he's going mag
[0:56:41] <HotSauceFiend> damn countered again
[0:56:41] <+paladinstarbuster> @MajorCrasher pretty sure thats while he was darkling
[0:56:45] <+Jiggisnipe> Firetail hmmm
[0:56:46] <%topendbuzza> coma him for days
[0:56:47] <glass_marcus> Fire Tail is our only hope
[0:56:51] <dds333a> @paladinstarbuster oh no, dont misunderstand. I never said it did, every bit helps
[0:56:56] <HotSauceFiend> C-C-C-cross countered
[0:56:57] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Firetail counters
[0:57:02] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:57:07] <+hoenhime344> may you beat this beast back with a thousande minh fury
[0:57:12] <%MajorCrasher> see counters don't mean shit
[0:57:14] <glass_marcus> Firetail is the only enemies that know how to play
[0:57:19] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> These monsters/enemies have patterns and I hate how they can‚Äôt read them fuck
[0:57:19] <user_naim> Minh is about to get off his horse
[0:57:29] <TTouchdown> Counter cost him a turn
[0:57:40] <dds333a> @majorcrasher as was apparent last sesh too LUL
[0:58:42] <dds333a> big purchases?
[0:58:48] <%topendbuzza> fling and sap
[0:58:56] <%emMmDeeKay> Think this Echo plan will work? will this effectively double woolie's damage output?
[0:58:57] <%MajorCrasher> oh? woolie got a plan?

[2:46:23] <+pectusumbra> I mean depending on how it shakes out, reggie might help out with some magic and let woolie clock him
[2:46:27] <galilafigala> Woolie has been drawn into the First's genjutsu

[2:56:57] <Lancaster_H> Firetail's battle plan is still more interesting than Minh's
[2:57:02] <dds333a> what status does woolie have
[2:57:04] <%topendbuzza> island
[2:57:06] <%zoe_wynnes> woolies df is half the rest of the party, his hp is average, and his attack isnt really dwarfing anyones defense

[2:57:55] <Asuterisuku> We might see Reggie darkling though.
[2:57:57] <Lancaster_H> @Reverend_Roscoe you missed another world revolution by the big monster, so no reason for a darkling

[2:58:10] <dds333a> @asuterisuku indeed LUL
[2:58:16] <%MajorCrasher> woolie's probably not gonna use it until end game where it matters in a final battle. otherwise it's pretty useless
[2:58:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Phew
[2:58:33] <alroy909> since world revolutions happen like every 2 weeks now, darkling really is useless

[3:09:14] <%kyh9> @Lancaster_H And it SUCKS because now the X-men are not only allowed to be good but they're as good as they've been since the Morrison era
[3:09:17] <dds333a> @kyh9 LUL
[3:09:18] <+Grayhammatter> it is absolutely not
[3:09:28] <+samuraiknack> So is Wolverine circumsised?
[3:09:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie that is correct
[3:09:31] <%thesw1tch> @paladinstarbuster his entire strategy changed between certain sessions and he went all in a different build. also, why does he have notes for?
[3:09:33] <HentaiIsloveAH> dude he is fighting you and the ninja
[3:09:44] <+pectusumbra> catch the town so you'll be between both stores?
[3:09:56] <dds333a> @akw4rd_buff4lo get ready for a real mon ami LUL
[3:09:58] <%kyh9> @samuraiknack Yes, Wolverine has had his penis and just about every other inch of his body stripped of flesh.  It still regrows tho
[3:10:09] <%kyh9> Wolverine has been circumcised MULTIPLE times
[3:10:13] <%thesw1tch> @paladinstarbuster minh never writes shit down while playing but he has notes
[3:10:13] <+Jiggisnipe> hopefully he doesn't reflect
[3:10:16] <%kyh9> I would imagine
[3:10:18] <+pectusumbra> just reflect he can't hurt you

[3:10:33] <+Grayhammatter> EZ
[3:10:45] <+Jiggisnipe> I was worried about him reflecting Reggie's magic
[3:10:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Fling him?
[3:10:59] <+Grayhammatter> coma him?
[3:11:00] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie needs to fling Minh
[3:11:02] <+pectusumbra> dump mystery?
[3:11:04] <dds333a> @thesw1tch to be fair, the tank build solidified last session, and Minh has been pumping df since session 2
[3:11:11] <+Jiggisnipe> Coma then Fling
[3:11:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Important: Does fling throw him off the continent or no?
[3:11:24] <dds333a> not sayin he potentially hasn't done research, but his gameplan has been developing
[3:11:46] <dds333a> @th3smartalec potentially, but it sure as hell hasn't LUL LUL
[3:11:46] <%thesw1tch> @dds333a that's when i think minh looked shit up after session 1

[5:44:38] <%Vigonept> sunshine wins the tournament
[5:44:40] <rReizs> NIDAIME DOKAGE
[5:44:41] <dds333a> just raw fights
[5:44:42] <galilafigala> soften Sunshine up for the true hero Kappa
[5:44:42] <Archmortal> "he's got all of our best stats, therefor I should kill everyone else"
[5:44:43] <HentaiIsloveAH> to much thinking from woolie
[5:44:43] <Teras_ode> can any of you even kill sunshine? hypothetically
[5:44:44] <JetpackMcQuack> Fuck him over
[5:44:48] <+DovaDude29> No @ultimate_edge , hit Minh
[5:44:49] <+jaguarkek318> while the boys fight each other
[5:44:52] <%thesw1tch> didnt take items so fuck it attack minh
[5:44:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1457949040566575106?t=WRD3hhRxnZrnVQfqKaaqMA&s=19
[5:44:53] <KombatJunkeeTV> NotLikeThis
[5:44:56] <+paladinstarbuster> raw attack
[5:45:00] <+pingu_crimson> fuck him up reggie
[5:45:02] <+Ultimate_Edge> Dam. Wanted to see someone win against Sunshine
[5:45:03] <haisho> it should technically be possible to kill Sunshine
[5:45:06] <+RurouniGeo> why didnt they both attack minh its so dumb lol
[5:45:06] <HentaiIsloveAH> sunshine is going to win LUL
[5:45:12] <alroy909> oh wow, reggie defeated woolie, actually not that surprised
[5:45:17] <+Grayhammatter> that's certainly on woolie
[5:45:19] <+DovaDude29> Weaken minh so he looses to sunshine. If he can‚Äôt win then nobody wins
[5:45:19] <+jaguarkek318> Sunshine is inevitable
[5:45:20] <%xcompleasedad> @Ultimate_Edge Minh will. BARELY
[5:45:22] <KyberNasse> #TEAMSUNSHINE
[5:45:23] <BurdRightsActivist> @RurouniGeo Woolie didn't know you couldn't take shit after killing
[5:45:26] <Teras_ode> yep sunshine has already won
[5:45:26] <haisho> but you'll need pre-hollowing Reggie levels of luck
[5:45:27] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[5:45:27] <JetpackMcQuack> you would have to actually work together
[5:45:34] <+Ultimate_Edge> @xcompleasedad I don't believe
[5:45:39] <%Vigonept> rip
[5:45:39] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> GG‚Äôs what an adventure
[5:45:43] <+jaguarkek318> Sunshine takes the blood pool
[5:45:45] <+Grayhammatter> chunked
[5:45:52] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> SALT AND BLOOD
[5:45:57] <+jaguarkek318> the game was the real winner in the end
[5:45:58] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie couldn't take Woolie's stuff so this might benefit Reggie if they all spawn at the coliseum
[5:46:03] <galilafigala> Reggie vs Woolie is mostly an initiative battle since they both have high stats vs the other's low defense against their favored attack method
