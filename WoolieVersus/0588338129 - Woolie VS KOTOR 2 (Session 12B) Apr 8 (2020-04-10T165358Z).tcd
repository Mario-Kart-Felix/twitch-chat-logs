[0:00:21] <+personmanthingg> we back
[0:00:27] <Zouledge> Ah ok, clearly John sliced into the camera
[0:00:53] <theanora1> Hey, Woolie, Black Mesa's part 12 is mislabeled as part 11
[0:01:10] <frantherobot> Is the audio roboty only for me?
[0:01:20] <Ravenian96> Sounds fine on my end
[0:01:21] <+ZoltanBMagnus> audio fine for me
[0:01:31] <DatAsuna> It always worked well on controller
[0:01:42] <%cisealnine> It sounds fine for me as well.
[0:01:51] <DatAsuna> I play it on android for funsies, supports controller and mods and mutiplayer
[0:01:59] <teamzackattack> this my favourite series since automata. this is absolutely fantastic
[0:02:03] <frantherobot> refreshed. It was me
[0:02:30] <+Bluemanzee> Jedi Knight was dope
[0:03:02] <DatAsuna> Tavion looks better in academy than outcast tho
[0:03:05] <subjectg> wonder if you can do movie battles 2 on console
[0:03:11] <DatAsuna> That's not only outcast
[0:03:17] <Razeino> Kotor story with Jedi Knight gameplay would be the best
[0:03:27] <DatAsuna> you can't do it on console, sadly
[0:03:31] <Ravenian96> Academy is 2003
[0:03:34] <DatAsuna> republic commando as well
[0:03:42] <DatAsuna> 03-05 are the golden years
[0:03:44] <MasterDecoder> @DatAsuna YES
[0:03:56] <subjectg> still playing bf2 2005 today
[0:03:58] <therealtacopancakes> Republic commando was amazing
[0:04:01] <DatAsuna> bounty hunter came out the same year as dead to rights
[0:04:02] <Halospaz117> Bounty Hunter was fucking rad
[0:04:04] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> BOUNTY HUNTER
[0:04:07] <Ravenian96> Bruh I love capturing people as jango
[0:04:24] <+gkingsausagelink> that was my childhood
[0:04:30] <DatAsuna> putting that game next to it's contemporaries on console makes it much more impressive
[0:04:35] <+gkingsausagelink> that game was my favorite game
[0:04:55] <fuji_92> bloodpool?
[0:04:56] <+Bluemanzee> I've heard stories but I have yet to witness
[0:05:05] <%Jetzord> BAPTISE IN THE BLOODPOOL

[0:06:22] <subjectg> it’s all fun and games until the money match
[0:06:44] <DatAsuna> not just cool, ducking cool
[0:07:06] <DatAsuna> wasn't enough for me

[0:07:20] <%prime_name> Destiny was Destiny
[0:07:26] <%KnivesEve> destiny is destiny
[0:07:33] <DatAsuna> I also tried with 2 and bounced off

[0:11:50] <+Freeborg1997> His magnum opus
[0:12:05] <Ravenian96> VERY in-depth
[0:12:08] <DatAsuna> I'd agree with that yeah
[0:12:10] <+wunp_fxs> very deep
[0:12:20] <%Gruhunchously> There's a lot of text
[0:12:21] <@Squdnate> You would love Disco Elysium
[0:12:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> Planet escape: Tournament is arguably one of the best written vidjer games
[0:12:28] <+wunp_fxs> ask pat he might know
[0:12:33] <+rider_megalon> ask Pat
[0:12:35] <atema128> KotOR 2 is effectively just Torment rewrapped in a Star Wars box.
[0:12:38] <Bassman_PhD> one of the greatest RPGs
[0:12:40] <DatAsuna> Just call it a fuckthrough
[0:12:41] <ShinChris> it's honestly not challenging, tbh
[0:12:57] <%prime_name> Literally miss more than half of the game
[0:13:01] <therealslimskippy> planescape torment is basically a visual novel i don't think it'd be a good stream kind of game
[0:13:16] <tombwolf_1> what up woolie and chat
[0:13:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, blind LP = big backseating and yelling in chat, probably
[0:13:43] <DatAsuna> most old crpgs aren't gonna do well for views
[0:13:49] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Isn't Disco ELysium really short?
[0:13:53] <%Irridium> a blind lp of planescape would be fuckin; rough. It's one of them old-ass games with old-ass problems and needs big guiding
[0:13:54] <%prime_name> Good thing you bumbled FE good and early.
[0:14:01] <subjectg> people still don’t understand lp poison
[0:14:05] <petwisk> so testplay Aways
[0:14:08] <atema128> I think it’d be a great game to play on your own time with a guide but as an LP, probably not the best choice. Torment’s great but that’s just how it is.
[0:14:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[0:14:09] <+Freeborg1997> @therealslimskippy KOTOR II has scenes where you're just standing and talking so I think it'll be fine.
[0:14:13] <tombwolf_1> planescape is a great game though
[0:14:14] <%jiggy_snipe> never forget #FE13000
[0:14:18] <YakumoYomi> Those old Infinity Engine games are LP poison
[0:14:24] <DatAsuna> #the13000FE
[0:14:24] <+rider_megalon> Annah is Woolie bait
[0:14:25] <petwisk> no one needs blind playtroughs
[0:14:37] <ShinChris> and tbh you'd want time to actually read and think out your choices, not yolo like usual lp's
[0:14:37] <dead_harmony13> #the13000FE
[0:14:45] <%Chatterbox1991> Just play New Vegas with Pat :)
[0:14:48] <+CelebrityGhost> KOTORII has voice acting which keeps it entertaining for the audience too
[0:14:51] <+rider_megalon> ^
[0:14:52] <Ravenian96> Planescape is literally 10x more standing and talking
[0:14:54] <Ravenian96> lol

[0:15:27] <%SirGO0SE> psa1guy
[0:15:36] <DatAsuna> Honestly it'd be fine you just wouldn't be maxing them out asap and it'd resemble a normal first run
[0:15:37] <%Gruhunchously> This is true.
[0:15:38] <ShinChris> planescape would be rough, yeah
[0:15:50] <DatAsuna> 7th stand user right after the FF3 LP
[0:16:02] <tombwolf_1> truth be told...baldurs gate would be a much better option than planescape. that being said, planescape is great, but baldurs gate has a lot less ways to fuck up, unlike planescape
[0:16:06] <skattikus> wait did they end the kotor 2 playthough or something?
[0:16:11] <%SirGO0SE> the ff3 lp was incredible ill never understand why no one watched
[0:16:14] <dead_harmony13> For real though V has been invaluable for this playthrough
[0:16:16] <%prime_name> Watch the cutscenes
[0:16:18] <+wunp_fxs> oh god
[0:16:19] <%prime_name> OOF
[0:16:23] <TrafficCohen> OOF

[0:16:27] <petwisk> P A I N
[0:16:29] <fuji_92> A year? minimum
[0:16:33] <TrafficCohen> LIMIT BREAK OOF
[0:16:34] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean...do you guys remember the Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 play throughs?
[0:16:41] <ShinChris> i mean FF7 is pretty simple
[0:16:46] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> LP friendly RPGs are defintely rare and need to usually be done in this classic style like you guys are doing KotoR 2, I think Disco Elysium is free of that restriction, but most of what you can try would need a guide
[0:16:46] <petwisk> pleasse Don't do blind playtroughs
[0:16:47] <%jiggy_snipe> @baja_sauce they are discussing the problems with playing something like planescape torment
[0:16:50] <Ravenian96> wtf I can't get past the Zolom guys
[0:16:55] <%Gigmunch> Exactly an experienced co pilot is KEY
[0:16:58] <zanzibarian_hamster> What about vampire the masquerade: Bloodlines?
[0:16:59] <skattikus> @jiggy_snipe ahhh ty!
[0:17:07] <DatAsuna> Honestly he remake is one of those "off air" games ideally
[0:17:10] <%Gruhunchously> Speaking of which, you lost influence with G0-T0 in that last conversation him with might screw you out of getting the influence dialogue with him unless you commit.
[0:17:12] <TrafficCohen> Vampire is pretty simple
[0:17:14] <therealslimskippy> vampire bloodlines is fucking dope
[0:17:16] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think FF7 would be too bad
[0:17:27] <%jiggy_snipe> it might get boring tho
[0:17:28] <fuji_92> yeah, vampire is actually doable
[0:17:28] <skeith77> would love to see you two play vampire the masquerade bloodlines :D
[0:17:29] <%MonkofAntioch> MonkofAntioch subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:17:39] <%Space_Pagan> Oh hell yeah, Vampire: Bloodlines!
[0:17:42] <TrafficCohen> Plus V:TM:B has the world's greatest dancing
[0:17:43] <+rider_megalon> just don't pray to the Lady of pain
[0:17:51] <+rider_megalon> you'll be fine
[0:17:54] <DatAsuna> So, FF11 LP confirmed
[0:17:56] <subjectg> @gruhunchously they might be able to save it, there’s a place on onderon you can get influence that can offset that
[0:18:03] <+MalekDracarus> WELCOME IN OMIKRON

[0:18:33] <%SirGO0SE> i still havent touched 3
[0:18:33] <Goodvibes99508> do it
[0:18:36] <StarlitStunner> Do it coward!
[0:18:36] <teamzackattack> @WoolieVersus despite knowing and loving a lot of RPGs, I honestly LOVE the way that you get into experiencing them for the first time
[0:18:37] <RenovatedLee> how much have i missed?
[0:18:38] <%Jetzord> Yo, I'd love Woolie Vs Mass Effect
[0:18:41] <DatAsuna> The worst part about ME3 is that a no gun laythrough only becomes viable int he third game, when you're locked into a class already
[0:18:43] <+rider_megalon> Woolie pay Andromeda its good
[0:18:50] <tomspartant99> i would like mass effect or jade empire that would be rad

[0:19:29] <+huggablemantooth> u guys are great
[0:19:40] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You should ask HK-47 more about the HK-50s, there's a lot of dialogue you missed the first time.
[0:19:43] <jorniev> i just showed up they are laughting, wha happen_
[0:19:58] <petwisk> my opinion if you want to do a LP of an RPG, play It to completion before doing a LP... No Blind let the surprises for Regie pra minh
[0:19:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> MY WALLET IS POWERFUL, JUST TRY TO DEFEAT THE PEACE POOL
[0:20:06] <teamzackattack> @WoolieVersus honestly man, I would adore watching you go through damn near any RPG because of the amount of care you take with them
[0:20:07] <%SirGO0SE> interesting, ive always heard the responses to the ending but i thought they actually patched it or something @BallerSwagBro9k

[0:30:03] <%jiggy_snipe> "traveling"
[0:30:20] <+Freeborg1997> @thetrashman_sc Jedi should actually know what sexual things are better than most people, so they know how to avoid it.
[0:30:35] <Ravenian96> It's MY cesspit
[0:30:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> Wookie Choke Jerking

[0:30:45] <SinnerBeta> is this carth pt2?

[0:31:00] <jorniev> remember that ps1 star wars game were you can kill all the npcs?
[0:31:02] <%ChoculaUltra> so I know the Sith organized the whole rule of 2 shebang, but who was the genius of the Jedi order who said lets teach young boys to suppress all strong emotions was the move?
[0:31:07] <%Jetzord> The Jedi are an abstinence only education
[0:31:12] <DatAsuna> don't question racism instar wars
[0:31:15] <DatAsuna> alens aren't people
[0:31:32] <thetrashman_sc> strong emotions lead to the dark side
[0:31:40] <%Gruhunchously> Ask about Hanharr
[0:31:41] <thetrashman_sc> monkaS
[0:31:47] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> no force wookie lol
[0:31:47] <zocano> It was planned once
[0:31:51] <%Gruhunchously> Ask about HANHARR
[0:31:54] <%Gruhunchously> rrr
[0:31:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> MOD?
[0:31:55] <thetrashman_sc> Hanharr sucks
[0:32:03] <+Freeborg1997> There's a Wookiee jedi in Legends: Lowbacca
[0:32:09] <+MidnightBurst12> they can be
[0:32:13] <Safarihat> wookie are jedi
[0:32:13] <thetrashman_sc> lowbacca was neat
[0:32:16] <+gkingsausagelink> there's a few but it's rare
[0:32:20] <MasterDecoder> Lowbacca: Am I a joke to you?
[0:32:21] <%jiggy_snipe> why couldn't they be?
[0:32:21] <dorpork> you were supposed to be able to train hanharr into a jedi but george lucas forbid it
[0:32:26] <%SirGO0SE> imagine if hanharr jedi...
[0:32:28] <Bassman_PhD> there was an EU wookie jedi
[0:32:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> @zanco23 Tell me your joking with that name
[0:32:28] <%Jetzord> there's a Wookie padawan in Clone Wars
[0:32:37] <StarlitStunner> They cut it because George said no
[0:32:44] <thetrashman_sc> wookiees are cool
[0:32:44] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie Wookie
[0:32:47] <KuroStardust> "I just think they're neat"
[0:32:47] <dorpork> ccording to Chris Avellone, Obsidian Entertainment wanted to give the player an option to turn Hanharr into a Dark Jedi character, but this idea was rejected by LucasArts due to George Lucas's ruling that there should be no more Wookiee Jedi introduced
[0:32:55] <KiddKame> What about Gungi from The Clone Wars? Dude had a wooden lightsaber?
[0:32:58] <eliudfs1> No love for the greatest wookie Jedi. Lowbacca
[0:33:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> If you love Wookies, you'll love the Star Wars Christmas Special
[0:33:04] <SinnerBeta> everyone's a bit force sensitive, some races just produce less specimen with higher force sensitivity, and some are just plain rare
[0:33:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> @melchior_the_wise SAY SIKE RIGHT NOW

[0:50:07] <%Djinnazz> ehh
[0:50:14] <atema128> @megalomaniacalmegalodon Enslaved. Let’s not beat around the bush with “conscript.”

[0:51:57] <DatAsuna> Zaheer the jedi
[0:51:57] <+Freeborg1997> I just finished reading the KOTOR comics. The final arc is set during the Mandolorian Wars. There was a group of rogue Jedi that sided WITH the Mandolorians. Not neutral like the main Jedi, and not against them like Revan.
[0:51:59] <%lotharrio> You might need to duck out the conversation and come back for the influence gain to matter.

[0:59:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> REEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:59:36] <TDAWS_MP132> No stun
[0:59:41] <Ravenian96> Also a debuff
[0:59:44] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @subjectg oh I think I bumbled into it once since I decided to do Nar Shadaa late once, today I learned
[0:59:46] <TDAWS_MP132> it harms enemy ability scores
[0:59:49] <+ShadowArcangel> Force Scream is fun for people who use armor and are also tired of seeing Dark side=Force Lightning
[0:59:52] <subjectg> force scream does a massive debuff too
[0:59:58] <nepwar> and it does a debuff
[1:00:14] <Zouledge> iirc force scream is more like a roar in swtor so that's kinda cool, also its my fav alternative to lightning
[1:00:16] <therealslimskippy> that's a 19d6

[1:01:07] <subjectg> i mean the damage is basically similar to horrid wilting, just lightning instead

[1:02:00] <candidateplays> don't forget finesse
[1:02:00] <Ravenian96> Finesse will give her +4 to hit
[1:02:06] <subjectg> look, fighting over dnd powerlevels is a crapshoot anyway
[1:02:07] <+thatotherblackkid> she doesnt have either Finesse yet
[1:02:16] <dorpork> force lightning consular is by far the most optimal way to tackle combat. nothing is faster than frying a mob with lightning. melee/guns can only focus on enemy at a time, and require frequently recastiing buff like force speed
[1:02:40] <BurdRightsActivist> haha force lightning to BRBRBRB
[1:02:43] <nepwar> get upgrade force speed so she actually hits more
[1:02:59] <Safarihat> finesse

[1:05:02] <%lotharrio> @SinnerBeta I think they're going for a double blade.
[1:05:30] <Redblood801> They gave him a gun for april fools when they swapped with r/historymemes
[1:05:41] <SinnerBeta> @lotharrio could you rephrase that? double blade could mean either two swords or a saberstaff
[1:05:44] <elrey745> Sup lads
[1:05:45] <+Manjove> there is that d&d character build video where it builds a Grievous

[1:06:02] <SinnerBeta> ok
[1:06:23] <+ShadowArcangel> Ok chat real question: Light side Visas or Dark side corruption Visas?
[1:06:39] <SinnerBeta> kind of a pity, two swords look cooler but staff is way stronger in this game
[1:06:40] <+Manjove> yes
[1:07:26] <Zouledge> @ShadowArcangel i usually go with dark side in kotor.

[1:12:20] <+thatotherblackkid> take Goto and HK?
[1:12:21] <%Gruhunchously> Hey, talk to HK about the HK-50s some more, you didn't ask all of them.
[1:12:34] <SinnerBeta> no no, round 100 is way more insulting
[1:12:40] <Zouledge> we also gotta make a withdrawal at twerka industries
[1:12:51] <thequickbrownrabbit> wait did you talk to vogga about the fuel now that gotos dealt with?

[1:21:21] <%lotharrio> She's armored, right now.
[1:21:28] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> deflect yeah
[1:21:37] <dorpork> armor is not worh losing out on force speed
[1:21:47] <%prime_name> Saber throw?
[1:22:10] <nepwar> hey chat, does lightsaber work on dual wield or do you toss only one no matter what
[1:22:19] <%lotharrio> Only one iirc.
[1:22:19] <zocano> It's a bummer you don't proc force jump with unarmed
[1:22:28] <Shinny1338> You only toss one.
[1:22:30] <+Greezey> @nepwar only one :(
[1:22:31] <MasterDecoder> @nepwar Always only one
[1:22:37] <+Solutha> Thats something that sucks pretty much every character cant where the majority of armor in the game
[1:22:39] <+Greezey> and u throw it super slowly
[1:22:44] <+Greezey> no vader chuck
[1:23:00] <nepwar> damnnn that was a waste of force points then
[1:23:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> tough waifu
[1:23:29] <+Greezey> it can bounce from enemy to enemy but its kinda slow compared to [[FORCE STORM]]
[1:23:40] <SinnerBeta> party members just need heal and revive, Fann will cast the only two buffs your party will need
[1:24:03] <nepwar> also noticed that its super strict on the range of the throw.
[1:24:08] <zocano> no force jump unarmed ):
[1:24:12] <Tucker0603> punch Jedi tank girl
[1:24:12] <SinnerBeta> V has been pushing for a punch jedi really hard since the LP started
[1:24:18] <+dmtjinni> who is woolie's couch buddy?
[1:24:25] <%lotharrio> Gonna be a Soldier, so why not?
[1:24:33] <Shinny1338> Darth Vee
[1:24:43] <nepwar> punch jedi or blaster jedi. which is cooler?
[1:24:52] <+Greezey> puuuuunch
[1:25:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> Punch
[1:25:15] <gruulmagebeast> PAWNCH
[1:25:15] <Zouledge> punch jedi, mace windu in the 2d clone wars miniseries is proof of that
[1:25:16] <%lotharrio> If they block blaster fire by spinning their guns, then gun jedi.
[1:25:19] <Shinny1338> punch. the game doesn't have it but some kind of cool blaster might make it a competition
[1:25:26] <+Greezey> anyone seen hunter x hunter? nobunaga from the troupe reminds me of lil V
[1:25:29] <nepwar> i liked the idea of blaster jedi because i just imagine dante but hes a jedi
[1:26:01] <Zouledge> @Greezey i know what you mean
[1:26:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> Then that means it's not exclusively blaster and that jedi has style switching
[1:26:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[1:26:20] <gruulmagebeast> you cant have a blaster in one hand and a saber in another or can you?
[1:26:21] <thequickbrownrabbit> So has V said where he got the custom lightsaber yet i know one of them is from disney but the other isnt
[1:26:27] <dorpork> gun jedi are obscenely powerful in this game
[1:26:27] <Shinny1338> Ok Jedi with saber in right hand and pistol in left
[1:26:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Blaster jedi is just REVOLVER OCELOT (revolver ocelot)

[1:27:20] <Shinny1338> Shooting your own lightsaber for trick shots
[1:27:44] <+Freeborg1997> I read the Tales of the Jedi comics over the weekend. With the romance between Ulic and Nomi and romance between Luke and Jem in Dark Empire, I feel like Tom Veitch hasn't had much romance in his life before.
[1:28:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> Even one hand blaster one hand saber is cool enough, just one single two handed blaster seems lame is all

[1:42:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> 150 bucks for LMGs?? Wow America's got it goin'
[1:42:12] <RonnyEclipse> way easier to fire a rifle than handgun
[1:42:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Yeah one of the reasons why we use rifles
[1:42:18] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah you can squeeze the rifle easier
[1:42:24] <SinnerBeta> 80% of your weight with your shoulder?
[1:42:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> $150 to shoot a Full auto, not to buy. lol
[1:42:33] <+Solutha> u lean in
[1:42:45] <%Chatterbox1991> PICK MIRA AND GOTO
[1:42:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Melchior_the_Wise I know thats pretty cheap in some places
[1:42:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> Depends on what the ammo is
[1:42:59] <Zouledge> @Chatterbox1991 why goto ?
[1:43:04] <carlosmiyamoto> HK fight incoming
[1:43:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Melchior_the_Wise true
[1:43:09] <StarlitStunner> HK is fun here

[1:43:15] <+Bluemanzee> yeyeye we mando-ing now
[1:43:16] <%Chatterbox1991> I think theres a bounty thing with goto
[1:43:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> Full auto .50, yeah. Full auto AK not so much
[1:43:24] <Zouledge> ah ok
[1:43:27] <+Solutha> U can get influence with Mira in like a second
[1:43:32] <gruulmagebeast> ground zero
[1:43:35] <DatAsuna> It's not blank, it has sith history too
[1:43:35] <Sol_Install> Duckson
[1:43:36] <%siamzero94> Blank? oh just wait
[1:43:36] <SinnerBeta> nice fern behind the window lol
[1:43:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Melchior_the_Wise well he said belt fed so AK is out
[1:43:42] <ingman112> Not goto yet. That comes later. But DEFINITELY mira
[1:43:49] <%Gruhunchously> @Chatterbox1991 GOTO doesn't have any influence on Dxun.
[1:43:58] <DatAsuna> the worst kind of creatue
[1:44:00] <StarlitStunner> Dxun and Yavin IV have a lot of sith lore
[1:44:04] <subjectg> *space fortunate son intensifies*
[1:44:09] <tolloponik> wouldn't a forest the size of a planet just be a jungle

[1:45:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> Better cover ourselves in mud then
[1:45:20] <%siamzero94> why would they attack their own planet woolie?
[1:45:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @thequickbrownrabbit Even with the id codes being different the Ebon Hawk is pretty fucking memorible
[1:45:26] <Ravenian96> Mandalorians attacked, why would they attack their own planet lmao
[1:45:29] <DatAsuna> hell naw
[1:45:30] <NeakGX> dino planet

[1:45:51] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Mandalorian Embassy, you mean the gym or the gun store?
[1:45:57] <+ShadowArcangel> The nomad warrior tribe with an embassy?
[1:45:58] <Ravenian96> Aggressive diplomacy
[1:46:02] <+Bluemanzee> Mandos were fuckin Metal in this era
[1:46:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> Mando politicians LUL
[1:46:06] <%ChoculaUltra> Mandolorian Diplomacy? Ah I see you've found their flamethrowers.

[1:46:10] <%RioGascar> Sureeeee
[1:46:12] <%lotharrio> "Hey guys, what are you up to? War crimes? That's cool, that's cool..."
[1:46:22] <gruulmagebeast> Darth Cena
[1:46:36] <DatAsuna> both
[1:46:38] <thequickbrownrabbit> granny just wants to laugh at him having war flashbacks
[1:46:45] <Memdosu> why not both
[1:46:45] <%ECRead> there's a place near me where you pay and get 100 bullets. shoot anything from handguns to a mounted minigun. but you only get 100 bullets.
[1:46:56] <+Gamingand808s> the big bad has spoken
[1:46:56] <nepwar> all according to keikaku - Granny

[1:49:05] <+ShadowArcangel> You only did a couple of HK dialogue before the audio messed up and the stream was cut short
[1:49:12] <%Chatterbox1991> insight gained
[1:49:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> The shadows are really janky here
[1:49:22] <%prime_name> Man, that FOV is not great
[1:49:22] <+Solutha> but with really bad fog
[1:49:24] <wowowinsane> there was a question about masquerading as protocol droids
[1:49:26] <dorpork> there is a mod to fix the fog of war
[1:49:36] <candidateplays> that looks wrong
[1:49:38] <%Gruhunchously> You had the right string of conversations but you just ask the same question you asked last time.
[1:49:40] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @gruulmagebeast they are saving her levels for later
[1:49:53] <gruulmagebeast> oh duh right

[1:51:27] <Tucker0603> with assassin is still the best to me
[1:51:38] <Tucker0603> sith
[1:51:42] <+ShadowArcangel> Assassin has a lot of cool animations

[1:52:03] <Redblood801> Who would win, the entirety of the Jedi order, or 1 zappy boi.
[1:52:06] <DatAsuna> Assassin tank is my fave
[1:52:21] <+gkingsausagelink> oh wow this kanok ate exar kun's armor that's crazy
[1:52:29] <DatAsuna> I hated the changes they made to advance classes so my merc can't have the flamethrower
[1:52:47] <%Gruhunchously> DM mode
[1:52:54] <%Jetzord> @Redblood801 Depends, does the zappy boi have a tragic tale to tell us?
[1:53:23] <%Gruhunchously> She seems to be slightly on the blue side
[1:53:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kreia is slightly blue ish
[1:53:36] <therealslimskippy> very gray
[1:53:44] <%lotharrio> So very right in the middle.
[1:53:45] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> bastard ate some expensive shit
[1:53:46] <Redblood801> @jetzord He was a slave and travels with a creature that constantly wants to eat him

[1:56:18] <Zouledge> @DatAsuna nice, voidstar was nice but got a bit too snowbally if you know what i mean
[1:56:30] <DatAsuna> Yeah, but it's fun to be the snowball
[1:56:42] <thequickbrownrabbit> we should tape a lightsaber to t3s head so he can ascend to being the ultimate lifeform
[1:57:03] <DatAsuna> novarre coast is fine too but watered down a bit by all the other turret maps
[1:57:06] <Zouledge> true not much to be snowballed though, also im stil mad what they did to ravage. but thats off topic

[2:01:40] <candidateplays> if he's here, he'll tell them to fuck off
[2:01:43] <+MidnightBurst12> talking mad shit about people he shares the same character model with
[2:01:44] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus this is why you bring Goto
[2:01:45] <%siamzero94> then who is paying them then?
[2:01:46] <dorpork> if goto in the party it changes the conversation I think
[2:02:00] <thequickbrownrabbit> Corpse (boring)
[2:02:02] <%RioGascar> Yeah but then you need goto in your party
[2:02:14] <Zouledge> @siamzero94 no one, yes they are that stupid.
[2:02:15] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> "I'll take the stupid one, that decided to talk instead of shoot us as soon as he could"
[2:02:29] <%Gruhunchously> The fight will be over in seconds

[2:04:22] <%Gruhunchously> And T-3
[2:04:33] <DSD24> Bao's like "I'm so fucking NICE right now"
[2:04:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dueling for punch
[2:04:53] <custoadian> Dueling would help with unarmed
[2:05:00] <Dangerzone979> Bao Dur needs a rocket fist
[2:05:08] <%Gruhunchously> @legacy0117 Not even that, they get electrocuted before the saber even reaches them.

[2:17:52] <zocano> all about that mandalorian disintegrator

[2:18:40] <DatAsuna> just make it their secondary loadout
[2:18:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 100% FIRE IMMUNITY
[2:18:47] <+captain_history> someone
[2:18:51] <nepwar> the ship is almost a no gun zone
[2:19:24] <KokiriKid07> Is it me or are guns a lot more viable this game over the first
[2:19:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fire immunity in D&D is great, if only for the potential to casually swim/burrow through lava.
[2:19:54] <%siamzero94> that's not normal
[2:19:59] <%RioGascar> that only works if dm is not scientific and picky
[2:20:00] <+Captain_Spicy_> @GeneralSCPatton Now THAT'S some good thinking! HahaThink
[2:20:01] <nepwar> uh oh
[2:20:03] <ooblag> the new upgrade system makes guns easy stronger, plus some good feats

[2:21:05] <%mesamus> so the bug of secret of mana
[2:21:09] <%lotharrio> @RioGascar Do you ask the DM what kind of damage magma does?
[2:21:32] <%ChoculaUltra> tell your dm to eat a bag of "magma damage."
[2:21:34] <+Freeborg1997> Whoa, he's actually bringing G0-T0 out. :o
[2:21:39] <+Bluemanzee> Mando time :o
[2:21:49] <%RioGascar> he said if I remember it does elemental
[2:21:49] <nepwar> time for mando sumo
[2:21:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mmm looks like some tasty XP
[2:21:56] <DatAsuna> only villains do that
[2:21:59] <+camarada_hidalgo> It`s the Jem`hadar!
[2:22:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Complete immersion in lava is like 20d6 fire damage. No way to get high enough resistance in 3.5, but immunity will take care of you. Then you just need to be suffocation-proof.
[2:22:05] <time_axis> their faces are so tiny
[2:22:10] <gruulmagebeast> their flag looks like the star forge
[2:22:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I am happy to see G0-T0 since I regret not using him, he could have a whole criminal drama show with HK-47 spinoff

[2:24:52] <Zouledge> @Halospaz117 sorry XD
[2:24:54] <%RioGascar> Oh hey candos voice actor
[2:24:55] <+Freeborg1997> No... just some random Mandolorian...
[2:24:59] <Pechugaman> Cando the Mando baby
[2:25:00] <%SirGO0SE> so happy no one spoiled this
[2:25:01] <%arkv01> our BOY
[2:25:20] <+Bluemanzee> He's leader of the Spacwe Vikings now
[2:25:25] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> time for more war stories
[2:25:25] <%Pillagius> Cando say this is not The Way
[2:25:53] <Halospaz117> "Why are you clasping my hand, you're not Revan"
[2:26:06] <+MidnightBurst12> Onderon and Duxn are metal as fuck
[2:26:10] <MasterDecoder> @Halospaz117 lol
[2:26:16] <DatAsuna> That's what happens when you put on the mask
[2:26:16] <GarbageNirvana> Maybe it's an honoriffic
[2:26:17] <a_mad_dragon> well there was an original mandalore
[2:26:30] <%lotharrio> Hello, I'm John AMERICA.
[2:26:35] <GarbageNirvana> Or like a Dread Pirate Roberts situation
[2:26:42] <zocano> It's a shame cause I didn't recognize the voice (as someone that didn't like Kotor1) so the actual canderous reveal later was a super cool drop
[2:26:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> MANDALOR IS DEAD LONG LIVE MANDALORE
[2:26:51] <+therabbles> if you wear the kings skull you are the king
[2:26:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Mom said its my turn to wear the helmet!
[2:27:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> The number one headband?
[2:27:10] <therealslimskippy> the absolute best boy
[2:27:17] <%jinking79> made Vadar look like a bitch
[2:27:19] <%Gruhunchously> Canderous' story is literally the same a Wrex in Mass Effect
[2:27:22] <zocano> the actual name drop is one of my favorite moments
[2:27:23] <Zouledge> Someone please show woolie art of mandalore the ultimate.
[2:27:26] <Ravenian96> Mandalore the Preserver
[2:27:26] <gruulmagebeast> i am the manda-LORAX i speak for the war
[2:27:31] <Halospaz117> I believe Canderous's proper title is Mandelore The Preserver
[2:27:42] <Halospaz117> Ok yeah, thank you other ugy
[2:27:46] <Halospaz117> guy
[2:28:01] <zocano> yes this is Mandalore the Preserver
[2:28:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @legacy0117 Anyone who held onto that helmet for longer then a week is a MONSTER
[2:28:16] <%Pillagius> @Gruhunchously well, it's same type of character, but... I don't remember Wrex doing orbital halo jump riding a mech :D
[2:28:18] <Zouledge> @Halospaz117 youre right, sadly their story does not end will after kotor 2
[2:28:22] <gruulmagebeast> candalore
[2:28:25] <+Bluemanzee> Just casual trips to Onderon looking like Iron Man
[2:28:27] <+ShadowArcangel> Time to get some HONOR
[2:28:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> DO YOU KNOW THE WAE
[2:28:30] <Redblood801> This is the way
[2:28:32] <dereks0n> THIS IS THE WAY
[2:28:37] <+FrenchTact1cs> wrong meme
[2:28:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THIS IS THE WAY
[2:28:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> DO YOU LIKE ME, SENPAI?
[2:28:46] <%Gruhunchously> This is the way
[2:28:49] <Halospaz117> @Zouledge To be fair, the amount of story's that end well after KOTOR 2 isn't that high
[2:28:52] <%mitchteck> This is the way
[2:29:15] <KokiriKid07> Ya gotta be a cool guy to impress Mandalore
[2:29:15] <%siamzero94> careful, one of them is a badass
[2:29:16] <Ravenian96> If you beat them up they are weak, that's fine
[2:29:18] <StarlitStunner> @pillagius Wrex was raised on an irradiated desert full of Dune Worms tho. Not as cool as basilisk wear droids but still pretty good.
[2:29:19] <+MidnightBurst12> uganda is confirmed mandalorian country
[2:29:21] <tolloponik> give em' WAR flash backs
[2:29:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:29:25] <Zouledge> @Halospaz117 one of the reasons i dislike swtor, it kinda idolizes kotor 1 and kotor 2 gets barly any love
[2:29:29] <+Bluemanzee> The Mandalorian is a cool show, but it would be infinitely cooler if it was about this dude imo
[2:29:34] <Redblood801> Are you a coll enough dude to hang with Mandolore?
[2:29:54] <%Pillagius> @StarlitStunner good point! :)
[2:29:59] <Redblood801> Never
[2:29:59] <snapshotkin> 4Head
[2:30:03] <DatAsuna> You can get silver mando armour tho
[2:30:06] <keiji_maede> no
[2:30:18] <+ShadowArcangel> nah, The Ultimate armour is waaay cooler
[2:30:25] <%Gruhunchously> If it was the standard, he wouldn't be Mandalore
[2:30:26] <snapshotkin> Godly
[2:30:32] <Halospaz117> @Zouledge Yeah, I like SWTOR, but as it's own thing. I hate nearly everytime it tries to call back to the old games (I do kinda like how fucked Taris gets though)
[2:30:34] <DatAsuna> I prefer the indommitable look to the ultimate look
[2:30:36] <%Pillagius> In art for the Mandalor the Ultimate - he also has sick red cape
[2:30:39] <+ShadowArcangel> The red, gold and black is really stylish
[2:30:39] <%lotharrio> Kaaaachi
[2:30:45] <snapshotkin> PogChamp
[2:30:47] <Goraka91> Oh Canderous and his war stories
[2:30:50] <%RioGascar> Please put your boners away woolie and V
[2:30:57] <Bruno_Tropical> That whould SUCK
[2:31:11] <%siamzero94> no
[2:31:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmm
[2:31:39] <+Greezey> keks
[2:31:39] <+Solutha> What a G
[2:31:49] <Zouledge> @Halospaz117 i could go one for a while bout swtor but ill stop to avoid potential spoilers
[2:31:50] <%Gruhunchously> It really won't
[2:31:51] <Goraka91> Not just traffic, SPACE TRAFFIC
[2:31:51] <DatAsuna> casual shit talk
[2:31:58] <DatAsuna> Manderous
[2:32:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> reminder that we still have one more party member space
[2:32:15] <+therabbles> he is the mando now
[2:32:22] <Goraka91> Candalore the Mandelorious
[2:32:27] <+FrenchTact1cs> Its not actually Cando
[2:32:31] <zocano> WAIT
[2:32:33] <dereks0n> Mandalorians are extremely uncreative with naming
[2:32:37] <Ravenian96> Clan Ordo
[2:32:37] <KokiriKid07> Mandalore the preserver is super chill
[2:32:38] <zocano> I JUST SHIEKH
[2:32:39] <zocano> FUCK
[2:32:39] <Redblood801> Its Canderous Woolie
[2:32:48] <DatAsuna> Ordo becomes a name that comes up a lot
[2:32:48] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> he yells it a LOT with his crit shout
[2:32:53] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> "FOR CLAN ORDO!"
[2:33:05] <%Gruhunchously> "WHO WAN'T TO DIE FIRST?"
[2:33:06] <Jflaskd13> no spoilers
[2:33:07] <+OneGorillionDollars> Mandalore isnt just a name when you have it, It serves as a title too
[2:33:09] <Halospaz117> @Zouledge Yeah there are plenty of problems with SWTOR, but I also like being by Bounty Hunter voiced by Azula with the biggest ego ever that they can also back up
[2:33:13] <Ravenian96> Bruh imagine an Ordo showing up in the Mandalorian
[2:33:14] <candidateplays> 2 works
[2:33:15] <NeakGX> Canderous the Manderous
[2:33:23] <Redblood801> Vizla, Fett, and Ordo show up a lot
[2:33:31] <+ShadowArcangel> Also while in the topic of mandos, Cassus Fett is the goddamn coolest
[2:33:46] <damienlunas> Every room on the planet is the Mandalorian Room
[2:33:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> Ah KOTOR, the only series where conversation is more satisfying than action
[2:33:47] <Fuji808> KOTOR 2 - Less action, more dialogue, and yet still more hype than KOTOR 1.
[2:33:55] <+FrenchTact1cs> FIGHT PIT
[2:33:56] <StarlitStunner> The elite’s like Fordo in the clone wars get trained under clan Ordo
[2:33:59] <nepwar> and a person who has info on a certain jedi
[2:34:01] <therealslimskippy> this is just a really big mandalorian room
[2:34:02] <Ravenian96> Isn't Cassus the one who deliberately drove the Cathar into the water and gunned them down
[2:34:04] <shincadad> !uptime
[2:34:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 34 minutes
[2:34:07] <DatAsuna> tl;dr enjoy SWTOR for what it is and stop complaining about what it isn't
[2:34:11] <Goraka91> @Halospaz117 All the Sith storylines are great, even more so if you go light side LUL
[2:34:17] <DatAsuna> it isn't galaxies 2 and it isn't kotor 3, oh well
[2:34:27] <%RioGascar> @reizie_etherealm Theres one other game. Disco eslyium
[2:34:43] <Reizie_Etherealm> Oh shit you're right I forgot about that game
[2:34:45] <StarlitStunner> @ravenian96 Cassus Fett committed a lot of war crimes on Tarris
[2:34:49] <Redblood801> Light side Sith Gang Rise Up!
[2:35:00] <Goraka91> Baras did nothing wrong
[2:35:14] <Halospaz117> @Goraka91 Yeah, it's so satisfying confusing all the stuck up jedi who can't comprehend the fact that you're to some degree a decent person
[2:35:16] <Ravenian96> @StarlitStunner Cassus' big war crimes had a big hand in creating Revan
[2:35:18] <DatAsuna> @StarlitStunner Telos, but mostly cathar
[2:35:28] <gruulmagebeast> MANDEROUS
[2:35:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Mando-Town USA
[2:35:40] <DatAsuna> What Baras did wrong was get fat after the comics
[2:35:43] <prince_johnny_> Great stream!
[2:35:49] <Zouledge> welcome to new mandalore
[2:35:51] <Pechugaman> Cando the Mando. Our lord and Savior.
[2:35:52] <mitochondriahousepower> FOR CANDALORE!
[2:35:54] <%Gruhunchously> The next part is going to be great
[2:36:01] <Goraka91> @Halospaz117 Honestly just makes me want actual good guy Sith , or at the very least one's who aren't raving lunatics
[2:36:13] <zocano> I played the first game and didn't recognize the voice
[2:36:22] <zocano> so the actual name reveal was cool later
[2:36:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[2:36:40] <Zouledge> @Halospaz117 didnt know she voiced azula, nice
[2:36:41] <%RioGascar> Or if you never played kotor 1
[2:36:46] <Goraka91> @DatAsuna Wait there's PREFAT Baras!? LUL
[2:36:50] <%RioGascar> You would go, oh it’s solidus snake
[2:37:09] <gruulmagebeast> this isnt even the planet its the goddamn moon
[2:37:10] <%Gruhunchously> I like the sound of that
[2:37:18] <Halospaz117> @Zouledge Dude there are a lot of cool VA's in SWTOR, the male Jedi Knight is voiced by fucking Solid Snake. It's him just doing his regular voice sure, but it's still fucking cool
[2:37:23] <Zouledge> @Goraka91 very much so yes, but that was before he got his singing voice
[2:37:34] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> There are A LOT of spots to get HK influence here. Hanharr too
[2:37:37] <Jflaskd13> oh boi
[2:37:37] <%Gruhunchously> You can get influence with G0-T0 on Onderon as well
[2:37:39] <%mesamus> LUL
[2:37:46] <Zayasu> hoes mad SourPls
[2:37:47] <%Gruhunchously> But also HK
[2:37:53] <Goraka91> Wrex is just Canderous 2 huh
[2:37:53] <DatAsuna> Just the mask
[2:37:53] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Breakfast_Megapowers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hello Star Nerds how are the hypest streamers in the galaxy?
[2:37:54] <%arkv01> HOES MAD woolieMIRIN
[2:37:56] <Halospaz117> I think that is the actual first time I heard the song and not just the meme
[2:37:56] <Jflaskd13> LUL little V is a man of his word
[2:38:07] <DatAsuna> CLone wars and rebels are a different timeline
[2:38:30] <%krispen_wa> oh shit i just got here, they managed to get all the way to dxun already?
[2:38:37] <ooblag> Remember that Cando, at the end of KotOR, was talking about how fighting for the sake of fighting, was no longer enough
[2:38:57] <Halospaz117> Is it the entire armor or just the helmet?
[2:38:58] <DatAsuna> The name is the title
[2:39:04] <gruulmagebeast> manderous
[2:39:06] <DatAsuna> It's like being the undertaker
[2:39:07] <Zouledge> @Halospaz117 true though some are better than others imo due to weird direction.
[2:39:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Jedi have even claimed the title
[2:39:11] <Halospaz117> I seem to remember it just being the helmet of mandelore you need
[2:39:14] <Jflaskd13> no true scotsman inheritance
[2:39:18] <Goodvibes99508> its the number 1 headband
[2:39:18] <308caliber> @Halospaz117 the Helmet
[2:39:31] <%krispen_wa> You're getting paid in Pure Bladestone
[2:39:57] <Goraka91> It's thousands of years before the current stuff, I assume the helmet was lost to time or destroyed or something
[2:39:59] <fetrigon> It's like monster hunter
[2:40:10] <DatAsuna> jetpack uppercut
[2:40:13] <Goraka91> TRICKSTER
[2:40:16] <DatAsuna> grapple wire and jetpack drag
[2:40:19] <%RioGascar> That mechanic/lore ide a also translates perfectly to video games
[2:40:23] <DatAsuna> etc
[2:40:32] <Malik1002> HEY Wollie where you at in clone wars? @woolieversus
[2:40:35] <%lotharrio> Sword-Trick-Jetpack-Gunslinger!
[2:40:43] <%krispen_wa> Woolie betrays humanity for a jetpack only to realize he doesn't know its secret techniques
[2:40:48] <DatAsuna> Not boba's
[2:40:54] <Zouledge> i want to say the jer pack stuff is called rising phoenix but im not 100 percent sure on that
[2:40:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @goraka91 Theseus' helmet. Every piece has been replaced during repairs.
[2:40:58] <Halospaz117> Bubba Fett
[2:41:04] <DatAsuna> Well boba's helmet is important but it's not mandalore's helmet
[2:41:04] <%RioGascar> Woolie you will die when you first get to use a jetpack
[2:41:09] <Goodvibes99508> rising Phoenix is what the mandalorian is calling it
[2:41:09] <+snugglepuggs> bob-a
[2:41:16] <Goraka91> Oh boy Jar Jar
[2:41:19] <Zouledge> season 1 has good stuff but yeeah its oof
[2:41:20] <zocano> I tried to start Clone Wars
[2:41:24] <zocano> couldn't get through it
[2:41:25] <Goraka91> Two parter
[2:41:27] <%prime_name> The poison arc
[2:41:39] <%krispen_wa> UMBASA ARC
[2:41:40] <DatAsuna> and the lows are fucking low
[2:41:45] <Goraka91> The highs are very fucking high doe
[2:41:47] <%mesamus> Woolie come on, the really awesome things start are on season 2/3
[2:41:53] <%jinking79> little Boba
[2:41:58] <+mechslayer71> The CGI or the original ones?
[2:41:58] <Malik1002> they weren't to bad as a kid but that was the thing a kid
[2:42:01] <DatAsuna> the highs are higher if you haven't watched many films or TV before
[2:42:02] <fuji_92> so basically star trek in some parts?
[2:42:13] <DatAsuna> but a lot of the highs are also just homages to other things
[2:42:27] <Goraka91> I preferred the droids with their 1-2 voices, then Revenge made them WoaaAAAAaaaah crazy guys
[2:42:42] <Zouledge> as much as i love clone wars i miss the 2d version of grievous more
[2:42:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sassy statement: Numbers are no substitute for quality, master.
[2:42:56] <+mechslayer71> We talking the CG ones or the 2D ones? @chat
[2:42:56] <DatAsuna> More for the teens I'd say
[2:42:56] <%RioGascar> the kids show gets to surprise you when they get to say more mature words
[2:43:09] <Zouledge> 3d one @mechslayer71
[2:43:12] <DatAsuna> It's less that it became more adult and more that it tried to age with the child audience
[2:43:15] <%mesamus> hurry for the space vietnam episodes
[2:43:16] <%RioGascar> they say “kill” later on and I remember that somewhat shocking me
[2:43:17] <Goodvibes99508> on the lore the battle droids are essentially repurposed rent-a-cop bots
[2:43:26] <Goraka91> I've never actually watched Clone Wars outside of the movie, which put me off. I've seen clips of the later stuff though and that's PogChamp
[2:43:27] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:43:28] <+mechslayer71> Ok cool @zouledge
[2:43:32] <%jinking79> hey we needed money from these kid's parents so we can put money into these shows
[2:43:32] <Zouledge> np
[2:43:34] <%prime_name> Oh~?
[2:43:37] <Sol_Install> Eh...
[2:43:41] <Halospaz117> OHHHHH?
[2:43:41] <SlappyMeats> if we stop excusing kids shows for being stupid, maybe we'll have smarter kids slappy2LOL
[2:43:41] <fuji_92> oh?
