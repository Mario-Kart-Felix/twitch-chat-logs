[0:07:13] <$Futurecity10> Diabetic here, 1000 is basically death
[0:07:14] <%MyBulletsLAG> over a thousand usually means you should probably be dead. that's a big yikes.
[0:07:18] <+arancet> the CHARACTER side quests are

[0:08:15] <CappuccinoGuil> @Futurecity10 ummmmm yeah, I hope that was a typo or something, because he should run to a hospital immediately if that's the case.
[0:08:19] <$Futurecity10> I was 600 when I was diagnosed with type 1 and I almost died

[0:09:07] <%OldManJEWc> @cappuccinoguil I went into the hospital and had a blood sugar of 1089. I'm down to a steady ~80-120
[0:09:13] <armchairmaster_> Wait, what armor is THAT?
[0:09:18] <%MyBulletsLAG> Hey Woolie, can't wait for you to find the best hat in the game. Not gonna say where it is, but you'll know it's the best when you pick it up lol
[0:09:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's the deluxe armor no?
[0:09:27] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Shut up, uncle! Stealth kills are rad as fuck
[0:09:28] <%MyBulletsLAG> that's the deluxe edition armor
[0:09:29] <+bupkisoffthechain> it is
[0:09:36] <+xeros720> fancy color quests, got it
[0:09:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Anyone see that clip of the samurai expert being like "They're bandits. He is one and they are many. There is no dishonorable way. Just kill them."
[0:09:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Has woolie opressed a lot of peasants today?
[0:09:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @OldManJEWc holy cow, my guy, I'm glad you're alright, but geez. How did that happen?

[0:09:56] <Make_me_mad> The DLC armor really seems lame. I think a big part of the appeal of this game is getting cooler looking outfits as you go through.
[0:10:01] <TheSaltminer> where do the Duels fit into this equation?
[0:10:05] <%ChoculaUltra> there's this one mystic quest that's just a chef's fucking kiss to duels
[0:10:06] <Afterman_> @WoolieVersus there are a FEW good sideuqests. If its a named character please do it on camera.
[0:10:08] <$Futurecity10> @oldmanjewc yeah you were like halfway in the grave dude
[0:10:08] <%arkv01> he's feeling generous today, only 3 towns oppressed so far
[0:10:10] <%bread_assassin> I think it's fine if Woolie just does the non-Tales sidequests on camera.

[0:13:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey so has anyone figured out what causes the ammo loss bug? is it only fast traveling or hot springs? I fell like it's both but not always fast traveling
[0:13:41] <+DarkNerdShawny> @MyBulletsLAG I wanted to discover tho!!! The discovery thrill tho!!!! =(
[0:13:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> a bow maker
[0:13:51] <+evbites> my tip focus on sword
[0:13:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> is a mowyer nice to know
[0:13:54] <Drusain> bowyer? what's he doing out of seven stars?
[0:13:59] <Kei_Ar_> that fabric tho
[0:14:01] <sasparillatango> fletching is the feathers on the arrows that help them fly straight, a fletcher would be the person attaching the feathers to the shafts
[0:14:02] <%JustYudha> wind
[0:14:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:14:03] <brunoberserk> SO MUCH HONOR
[0:14:07] <%emperordread> isn't half a bow just some string?
[0:14:08] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> I wonder how long its gonna take him to get to the Golden Temple
[0:14:15] <%ChoculaUltra> it could be a draft!
[0:14:15] <+xeros720> so it's money
[0:14:18] <coldfire0007> That storm is really close
[0:14:18] <sleepy_pink> supplies is money basically
[0:14:22] <%OldManJEWc> @cappuccinoguil That sucks finding out through a dental procedure. Shit sucks
[0:14:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Supplies is money
[0:14:25] <+DarkNerdShawny> Ah forgot, the Japanese in this WESTERN GAME!
[0:14:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Supplies are money. Other materials are category-specific
[0:14:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> once you do THAT shrine, it's not as bad
[0:14:46] <armchairmaster_> @woolieversus Some of the merchants are mind of out of the way, so you gotta walk around the towns and stuff to find them. Also charms are SUPER USEFUL.
[0:14:53] <%ChoculaUltra> since there's like 0 shot woolie's gonna read this rn, there's an infinitely reloading chest super early in the game that makes upgrading a cakewalk
[0:14:55] <+evbites> trapper for ammo
[0:15:01] <CappuccinoGuil> @OldManJEWc oh, it was just the pre-operation test prep. Thankfully we discovered before doing it. But yeah, fuck diabetes LUL
[0:15:03] <Parapattern> Bows were the defacto samurai weapon. You were a shitty samurai if you let an opponent get close enough to have to use a sword.
[0:15:04] <+RyanTheRecluse> @cappuccinoguil ok have educated myself on this mg/dl measurement and holy shit its good you didn't die. In the mmol/L measurement thats around 60.4.
[0:15:07] <%thechungiestofbois> trapper increases quiver
[0:15:16] <+xeros720> quiver upgrades
[0:15:26] <Nekros4442> A quiver Minh
[0:15:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he sells both ammo and increases capacity
[0:15:32] <armchairmaster_> Trapper is for the quiver. But you need certain hides to do that.
[0:15:35] <T_Sasquatch> That's tha jokeeee
[0:15:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BEARS
[0:15:45] <+evbites> kill bears and piggies
[0:15:51] <+DarkNerdShawny> Bears and Boars
[0:15:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> Boars the greatest predator
[0:15:55] <+evbites> deer are holy no kill
[0:15:55] <+MaddyCaddy> You could say a predator
[0:15:55] <alexandrecau> DEERS ARE SACRED
[0:15:56] <Afterman_> deers are sacred to tsushima, they are not to be hunted
[0:15:57] <+xeros720> the dangerous predators, deers
[0:16:00] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Deers are sacred
[0:16:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> I know boars are a fuck don't worry
[0:16:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Deer drop nothing and a loading screen tip says they are sacred and not to be killed.
[0:16:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> I feel like Minh would benefit from having a pocket dictionary, just joking tho
[0:16:20] <armchairmaster_> NO HUNT DEER, it's dishonorable
[0:16:21] <+DarkNerdShawny> DO IT WOOLIE
[0:16:27] <+Arkfyre> do the side quest with the faces
[0:16:27] <sleepy_pink> you want to do the sidequests with faces because they're Good
[0:16:29] <%Irridium> I know deer give you nothing but fuck 'em, they die like rest
[0:16:30] <+SilverDevilfish> Blue, Gold, Silver with faces
[0:16:34] <wanderingdain90> Bears boars and doggos
[0:16:34] <Afterman_> @WoolieVersus IF its a quest from a NAMED character, please do it.
[0:16:36] <+bupkisoffthechain> do the gold mission that gets you ronin attire, it looks sick
[0:16:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @RyanTheRecluse oh I wasn't the one in the 1000s. I did lose a lot of weight before discovering it, tho. Went from like 80 kg to 57 in 3 months
[0:16:42] <armchairmaster_> Side quests with the faces are SUPER IMPORTANT story wise
[0:16:44] <%hattrick61> White with heads is how Pat put it
[0:16:44] <+arancet> gold is main story, character icons are character stories, blue are legends, white are shitty mini quests
[0:16:50] <Thelovelybison> Deer are SUPER sacred bro
[0:17:04] <+xeros720> horse feet
[0:17:11] <T_Sasquatch> I really like how jin doesn't have to kill deer
[0:17:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> Shinto Priest be like:Deers can't be hunted because they are sacred and I find them cute
[0:17:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Gold = Story, Blue = mythical, white w/ face is major side quest, white with no face are very short side quests but some are worth doing on camera
[0:17:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:17:32] <%OldManJEWc> Where does your allegiance lie? Perfect Dodge or Perfect Parry?
[0:17:36] <+xeros720> "WHERE"S OUR FUCKIN FOOD"
[0:17:38] <MayorRev> wuh oh
[0:17:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> animals are getting crazy
[0:17:42] <+evbites> you deer are bullshit - pat
[0:17:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @oldmanjewc Chain Assassinate
[0:17:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> The monkeys on thailands are going nuts
[0:17:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> the videos are crazy
[0:17:56] <MagusKen> Nara is legit
[0:18:02] <+bupkisoffthechain> @OldManJEWc lets not get political cmon dude
[0:18:04] <MagusKen> deer run tha tset like a gang
[0:18:05] <Parapattern> Random Ape Event
[0:18:06] <MAX116030> To be honest fastravel is kinda a disservice to the game
[0:18:08] <alexandrecau> "are the humans dead" animals coming out the woodwork
[0:18:10] <%Irridium> deer are assholes. and VERY dumb
[0:18:14] <%ChoculaUltra> really wish Perfect Dodge was the first node in the tree instead of the roll tbh
[0:18:20] <+evbites> squirrels are having race wars
[0:18:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> Nara deer are actually Yakuza
[0:18:31] <ELFucilaNeroIV> agressive deer
[0:18:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Squirrel race war?
[0:18:35] <NiktenKing> ALL OUT ATTACK!
[0:18:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Perfect Parry is satisfying AF but perfect dodge works on pretty much any attack...
[0:18:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> tell me more
[0:18:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Good thing we have 6 sets of eyes
[0:18:50] <%MyBulletsLAG> "Haha but really *pulls out glock* where the food at" -those deer
[0:18:53] <Nekros4442> Wear steeltoes...
[0:19:09] <%OldManJEWc> @choculaultra Agreed
[0:19:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> deer pellet shits
[0:19:17] <wanderingdain90> deer use shadow strangled jutsu i hear
[0:19:24] <%chiazam> That is NOT closer
[0:19:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol
[0:19:31] <%OldManJEWc> Perfect dodge with dodge to get +1 kunai charm is magical
[0:19:37] <+bupkisoffthechain> from the camp would be closer lol
[0:19:43] <+akikyou> I learned my lesson the hard way and spent an hour cleaning and de-shitting my shoes =(
[0:19:46] <chocolatebar__cb> sup, chat
[0:19:46] <%chiazam> He super could've climbed
[0:19:57] <+RyanTheRecluse> @cappuccinoguil ahh sorry. Yeah its weird cause without the insulin the body doesn't convert the excess sugar to fat but the increased ketones kill you slowly. When i was diagnosed I was practically in a coma.
[0:19:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> MAGIC HORSE
[0:20:04] <+evbites> witcher
[0:20:05] <%chiazam> That horse teleports like a motherfucker
[0:20:08] <+evbites> red dead
[0:20:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> You can fast travel drectly to the dojo, the tricky part is that you need to select the dojo and not the quest since they're next to each other
[0:20:10] <wanderingdain90> witcher
[0:20:12] <+evbites> yes
[0:20:12] <%toastybites> Witcher 3
[0:20:17] <+PaladinDupre> BotW kind of if you count the motorcycle
[0:20:23] <+arancet> in newer ac's its tele horse
[0:20:30] <+crimsonharvest> The worst one is the one in Dragon Age Origins
[0:20:33] <%Irridium> Origins and Odyssey they teleport to you
[0:20:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sometimes I turn the camera backwards while running to call the horse, so it appears in front of me.
[0:20:34] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, the reticle on the map is so damn sticky when it comes to picking locations/planting pins LUL
[0:20:35] <Halospaz117> Brotherhood added the ability to call them
[0:20:36] <snakest3alth> MGSV also does this, right?
[0:20:42] <+ColonelHandzLanza> I love Red Dead for how real it is but I would love this system in that game, at least online.
[0:20:43] <%chiazam> @Reizie_Etherealm You have to visit the dojo once to unlock it as a fast travel point
[0:20:47] <+crimsonharvest> er the new one not origins whatever
[0:20:50] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[0:20:51] <%chiazam> Deer ARE SACRED
[0:20:58] <%jinking79> D Horse
[0:20:58] <alexandrecau> minh you kille sacred ders?
[0:21:04] <Hammatime8> For the sport!
[0:21:09] <+RyanTheRecluse> had some fun moments of the horse popping up on mountain tops
[0:21:10] <%jiggy_snipe> just do it
[0:21:14] <%ChoculaUltra> if there's a pc port, I hope to everything there's a camera distance option cuz fuck me does it get super close at random moments
[0:21:16] <NiktenKing> LUL
[0:21:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus look along the edge for a patch you can climb down
[0:21:22] <T_Sasquatch> Minhs commentary has gotten soo much better over time LUL
[0:21:43] <%chiazam> It'll happen once, the drops are very deceptive
[0:21:46] <bunnyscruff> This game is so much fun, I love it
[0:21:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you gotta
[0:21:56] <+evbites> ththats wrong
[0:22:01] <%chiazam> PICK UP EVERYTHING
[0:22:02] <+Solutha> grab everything
[0:22:04] <%Irridium> okay but you want those flowers though
[0:22:07] <+bupkisoffthechain> Always grab flowers, never leave behind flowers
[0:22:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Things will be EXPENSIVE
[0:22:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you will ALWAYS need stuff
[0:22:18] <+evbites> and only upgrade one outfit
[0:22:22] <%chiazam> There's a reason for that
[0:22:25] <%bread_assassin> I mean, there's no reason NOT to pick up everything you see.
[0:22:34] <%chiazam> @evbites Never
[0:22:37] <%MyBulletsLAG> What's really funny is when a hawk lands on your opponent's shoulder during a standoff. had that happen to me lol
[0:22:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you'll need more types of resources too
[0:22:41] <zakor1138> Stuff is expensive in this game.
[0:22:46] <+RyanTheRecluse> you'll need so much iron
[0:22:47] <alexandrecau> Did minh just spent 10 hours sheathing his sword
[0:22:57] <T_Sasquatch> I'm literally three trophies away from plat. Still haven't fully upgraded most thinga
[0:22:57] <%MyBulletsLAG> he definitely did
[0:23:03] <%chiazam> You ain't ready
[0:23:10] <cosmicgoatee> become Honor by upgrading your pouch with bamboo
[0:23:15] <Nekros4442> so is Tomoe supposed to reference Tomoe Gozen?
[0:23:20] <+evbites> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh save for your main one or which ever you like the most
[0:23:20] <armchairmaster_> Bow to your sensei. Also IRON CAN FUCK ITSELF, that and predator hides are BS
[0:23:20] <%chiazam> yeah
[0:23:21] <Parapattern> She WILL fuck you up, my dude
[0:23:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Tomoe Kreygasm

[0:23:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 42 minutes and 44 seconds
[0:23:34] <%chiazam> @evbites All of them, I use all of them
[0:23:37] <Make_me_mad> This sensei seems like a dirtbag. Also he has the same eyes as Pat, so you can't trust him.
[0:23:46] <T_Sasquatch> Ishikawa is such a great character
[0:23:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> wait does the island have leopards?
[0:23:58] <sendart> tomoe will yeet you into the sky
[0:24:01] <Strtfghtr88> all the characters are great
[0:24:03] <%MyBulletsLAG> Jin is the straight man in this story
[0:24:07] <+crimsonharvest> nakayama = in the mountains?
[0:24:11] <+evbites> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh when and why?
[0:24:27] <+xeros720> "holy shit lady, your archery is sick"
[0:24:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> mongols born in the saddle
[0:24:30] <alexandrecau> Jin is the aristocrats

[0:25:07] <+evbites> got it
[0:25:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not noise but i think it does affect visibility
[0:25:13] <T_Sasquatch> Stealth in this game is ..... Yea ....
[0:25:17] <%MyBulletsLAG> sorry I meant straight man as in the normal guy in the cast of interesting characters
[0:25:23] <+xeros720> assume stealth is horribly simple unless it proves otherwise
[0:25:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> unless it doesn't then im stupid
[0:25:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> fucking hell
[0:25:35] <Strtfghtr88> ah gotcha @mybulletslag

[0:30:54] <blackkanye> I haven't played, but I heard Kunai is good for keeping dudes broken or staggered
[0:30:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it autolocks it's so great
[0:31:07] <+evbites> most side items allow for deletes
[0:31:14] <%chiazam> Yeah the Ghost weapons are MAD broken
[0:31:15] <Strtfghtr88> kunai is always good for groups
[0:31:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> BS ANSWER
[0:31:17] <%MyBulletsLAG> kunai that pierce the heavens
[0:31:20] <%ChoculaUltra> kunai are op as hell! can't imagine someone saying they're underrated in this LUL
[0:31:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i wish i could carry more smoke bombs tbh
[0:31:23] <alexandrecau> kunai are common and rreally good for a quick qin, but they are dishonorable

[0:31:41] <%chiazam> Smoke Bombs plus Triple Assassination
[0:31:47] <%illtima> I still wonder if this Tomoe is supposed to be Tomoe Gozen
[0:31:48] <Strtfghtr88> @choculaultra I say that cause people don't use them
[0:31:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> That's SKETCH sensei!
[0:31:52] <%OldManJEWc> I mean kunai is great for stagger, which setups a nice Heavenly Strike
[0:31:53] <ZippyPsycho> @shintenseicoma Yes
[0:31:54] <%toastybites> He's right, but it's 100% a jackass way of doing it
[0:31:54] <Make_me_mad> That guy looks so much like Pat.
[0:31:55] <%Irridium> oh man that is the guy who does Hijikata in Gintama. fuckin' suck

[0:32:06] <%Calenrow> can we just join Tomoe instead, fuck this dude
[0:32:09] <+evbites> he's a bastard
[0:32:28] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> He cool
[0:32:29] <%chiazam> Follow the trail, there are a lot of missions like this
[0:32:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> IF I MUST
[0:32:41] <+evbites> nah tome is a jerk too she kills civs all the time
[0:32:48] <T_Sasquatch> Stand off on hard is a bitch
[0:32:56] <%MyBulletsLAG> Follow the trail is the new Talk to Lilith
[0:33:02] <Djinnazz> Triangle
[0:33:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Standoff when the enemy starts doing feint attack fucks with me so hard lmao
[0:33:19] <%ChoculaUltra> stand offs on hard made me bump down to normal - I just want to be a badass with a katana dammit FeelsBadMan
[0:33:24] <alexandrecau> first is release and the two other is attack
[0:33:47] <dinnydanny777> Have we busted our first Ghost of Tsushima yet
[0:33:51] <+evbites> stand offs are impossible on hard in act 3
[0:33:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> OOF
[0:33:56] <+thackattack00> If you have trouble with the feints watch their feet instead, only time they actually move their feet is for real attacks.
[0:33:58] <SleepyMaribo> well these hostages are dead
[0:34:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Time to learn THE COST OF HONOR. LEARN TO SHANK
[0:34:05] <Djinnazz> no they're not
[0:34:07] <dinnydanny777> When do we bust these ghosts
[0:34:07] <%ChoculaUltra> @evbites YES, exactly where I bumped down LUL
[0:34:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> INNOCENTS DEAD
[0:34:11] <%chiazam> The execution takes a while tho
[0:34:17] <Parapattern> And DEAD
[0:34:23] <%gnoame> can't be killed by mongols if jin kills them
[0:34:25] <%MyBulletsLAG> lmao get fucked
[0:34:26] <nicversus> These hostages are getting woolie'd
[0:34:27] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> You can bypass a lot of the Morgols by being super aggressive.
[0:34:32] <artificerjoni> Oh Hi Patton
[0:34:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:34:38] <T_Sasquatch> @evbites doing 5 in a row is kinda impossible LUL
[0:34:41] <alexandrecau> water kata
[0:34:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> @artificerjoni Yo
[0:34:43] <CappuccinoGuil> OR SNEAK LUL
[0:34:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah the executions take a while, I usually just stand next to the hostage and it‚Äôs not an issue lmao
[0:34:45] <+deviljhojho_> This IS THE STANCE
[0:34:45] <%toastybites> what a mess LUL
[0:34:46] <+bupkisoffthechain> Water Stance PogChamp
[0:34:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[0:34:54] <ELFucilaNeroIV> STANCE PogChamp
[0:34:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @nicversus Friendly fire?
[0:34:57] <%BisoromiBear> be like watah
[0:34:57] <alexandrecau> nah wind stance is the best
[0:34:57] <Make_me_mad> Water stance best stance
[0:34:59] <%chiazam> Stances are also broken AS SHIT
[0:35:03] <%doomerskeletor13> The stance is so good
[0:35:04] <T_Sasquatch> BEST STANCE
[0:35:12] <phantomsleeves> woolie really...doing it
[0:35:16] <Ookamiden02> this stance looks so dumb
[0:35:17] <+bupkisoffthechain> Wind is the best, but I stay in stone most the time
[0:35:21] <%eyezehuhh> MoistCritikal approved stance
[0:35:22] <+evbites> one at a time
[0:35:23] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Tech points
[0:35:25] <Nekros4442> It's an extra combo hit Woolie
[0:35:38] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Nah THAT stance is the best
[0:35:39] <%doomerskeletor13> The Water stance fully upgraded is disgustingly good
[0:35:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHAT
[0:35:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> TOMOE
[0:35:54] <%MyBulletsLAG> There's a neat detail about the tutorial videos for each stance
[0:36:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> collaborator
[0:36:08] <%ChoculaUltra> yo highkey the most annoying shit in the game is when they pause the game to FORCE you to switch stances on an enemy.
[0:36:12] <+evbites> stone is great for when you can parry and just hack
[0:36:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fireflies
[0:36:34] <alexandrecau> think you can turn thos tutorial off
[0:36:34] <zecht89> wow zoro's voice does not fit at all
[0:36:42] <phantomsleeves> yeah sometimes the game is really GRIPPING your hand
[0:36:47] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:36:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[0:36:52] <dinnydanny777> AsbEstus
[0:36:52] <+evbites> @alexandrecau nope
[0:37:00] <Ookamiden02> The Hulkmania healing system
[0:37:07] <%ChoculaUltra> I couldn't find an option to toggle them off, legit just got one in the middle of a duel in Act 3 smh.
[0:37:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah, like ok maybe once i need a reminder, but quit telling me im on the wrong stance pls
[0:37:15] <%chiazam> I switch to whatever enemy the stance is best for
[0:37:19] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Imo the english dub is better than the Japanese voices
[0:37:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there's no animation
[0:37:25] <dinnydanny777> It's literally just go "GRRRRRR" to heal yourself
[0:37:31] <T_Sasquatch> I love the healing system in this game. You get rewarded for fighting and parrying well
[0:37:35] <Halospaz117> There's an animation if you're doing nothing, but you can do it while doing actions too
[0:37:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yelling is damage leaving the body
[0:37:38] <dinnydanny777> Get pumped up
[0:37:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> Taps chest for more time on the clock
[0:37:40] <phantomsleeves> idk if the expert HUD turns them off or makes them less aggressive
[0:37:45] <%chiazam> It's just like the Spider-Man system
[0:37:46] <Make_me_mad> Tomoe is ballin' out of control.
[0:37:51] <%ChoculaUltra> get to hyped to die
[0:37:51] <dinnydanny777> Jin heals himself through HYPE
[0:37:54] <%toastybites> yeah it's less of a heal and more of powering through the pain
[0:37:59] <alexandrecau> I mean he just hit one guy in the back
[0:38:02] <+evbites> heal is just the one cool kylo moment from force awakens
[0:38:02] <%chiazam> Your heal is also connected to special techniques
[0:38:27] <%MyBulletsLAG> Yeah the animation for it (when you're not doing an action and just moving) is you see him take a deep breath and roll his shoulders. It's a neat little animation.
[0:38:30] <phantomsleeves> is woolie playing on normal or hard?
[0:38:36] <%MyBulletsLAG> normal
[0:38:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[0:38:37] <Kahpoe_Lelou> that deluxe armor looking kinda nice tho what's the perks on it chat?
[0:38:48] <+jmstwn> Dlc armor is a lot better without the mask. The fur is great.
[0:39:12] <%OldManJEWc> Ishikawa is essentially just "I haven't been truthful to you..."
[0:39:15] <chocolatebar__cb> man, i'd kill for a game like this to col-lab some anime, imagine having a hiten mitsurugi-ryu style, or a gatotsu (i've been thinking a lot about ruroni kenshin)
[0:39:18] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't wanna talk about the later armors cuz idk if that would be spoilers for Woolie and the gang
[0:39:25] <%chiazam> It's so good
[0:39:29] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Smh
[0:39:29] <%illtima> Woolie learn fall rolling asap
[0:39:37] <Hammatime8> Hell yeah
[0:39:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ChoculaUltra i'd let them find out later
[0:39:37] <T_Sasquatch> @kahpoe_lelou major health increase and reduces all damage by a moderate amount
[0:39:42] <+cvp5127> honor is for losers
[0:39:52] <+bupkisoffthechain> 9 through the entire story tho
[0:39:56] <T_Sasquatch> Personally i just rushed parry and stances
[0:39:59] <%chiazam> You don't do all nine now
[0:40:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> 9 through whole game. only 3 or 4 right now.
[0:40:11] <Kahpoe_Lelou> @toastybites oh so just a slightly earlier adachi lol
[0:40:11] <phantomsleeves> dlc armor is the same as upgraded masako armor?
[0:40:15] <%doomerskeletor13> You can only do 4 of his wursts before Act 2
[0:40:18] <nintega010> I'm doing all stealth stuff
[0:40:27] <Djinnazz> no, DLC armor doesn't have any bonuses.
[0:40:28] <bunnyscruff> It's not all nine now
[0:40:30] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I maximized parry as soon as I could.
[0:40:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> early game i found it better to travel so you pick up resources or do encounters along the way
[0:40:34] <+Fattness132> the birds have collision
[0:40:36] <%chiazam> The masako armor gives you Resolve gain, so it's better RIGHT AWAY
[0:40:47] <+jmstwn> I JUST found out you can go back to old looks on upgraded armor.
[0:40:48] <Kahpoe_Lelou> @t_sasquatch but fur makes it better bawkGlad
[0:40:49] <+bupkisoffthechain> Who else in the chat finished the Yuriko missions?
[0:40:52] <+evbites> is it still honorable if you just suck at stealth
[0:40:54] <stevo_scar> continue Ishikawa for a great upgrade
[0:40:56] <3Xgilly> one flew straight into a mountain in my gamer
[0:41:00] <3Xgilly> game
[0:41:03] <%MyBulletsLAG> Your detective vision highlights the golden birds and foxes
[0:41:05] <phantomsleeves> @jmstwn how do you go back??
[0:41:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> If you suck at stealth that's just unintentional honor
[0:41:29] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> I only wear armor for the important mission/cutscenes
[0:41:32] <alexandrecau> unintentional honor is the best honor
[0:41:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @phantomsleeves select the armor like you wanna change color, then press triangle and it cycles appearance
[0:41:37] <+jmstwn> @phantomsleeves press triangle when youre looking at the armors. Theres a promot
[0:41:57] <+bupkisoffthechain> Damn he got that news fast
[0:41:58] <+jmstwn> I never noticed until like 20+ hours in
[0:42:02] <phantomsleeves> oh no way, i thought that was for changing colours
[0:42:09] <phantomsleeves> that‚Äôs sick, thanks guys
[0:42:15] <bunnyscruff> I tried my best at every chance I got to be not honorable
[0:42:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> d pad for colors, tri for appearance
[0:42:20] <nintega010> is jin jpn voice actor Zoro?
[0:42:27] <%ChoculaUltra> @nintega010 yep
[0:42:33] <+evbites> uncle: i'm so proud of you jin. bumbling jin:Why?
[0:42:42] <nintega010> nice
[0:42:43] <%ChoculaUltra> Blackbeard's VA does a voice too, I forget who
[0:42:50] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Woolie woolie
[0:43:01] <%MyBulletsLAG> Nah she starts using her Way of Tomoe lightning magic from Sekiro üòÇ
[0:43:06] <nintega010> Woolie doing more samurai path?
[0:43:14] <+bupkisoffthechain> linen is actually incredibly valuable to sell
[0:43:18] <%chiazam> @jmstwn FUCK YOU CAN? I probably won't end up using it, but that's sick
[0:43:22] <+evbites> god sekiro needed cool dlc
[0:44:05] <+evbites> like maybe some wolf themed beast skills
[0:44:05] <+jmstwn> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh i like it for a lot of the samurai armors. The full on sets are a bit too bulky for me
[0:44:43] <+thackattack00> Huh, Sekiro never got DLC did it? Weird for a FromSoft game.
[0:44:59] <%SuperKirby24> hayai
[0:45:04] <%Irridium> kind of like that Sekiro never got DLC. Nice to beat a game and be done with it.
[0:45:06] <%chiazam> HORSE
[0:45:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is there any use for wood after the first 2 bows?
[0:45:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can use your horse during some of these parts
[0:45:42] <jorniev> who is the best character so far?
[0:45:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:45:46] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Same like Infamous. It snaps into places.
[0:45:47] <%MyBulletsLAG> I was thinking either a story where you play as Tomoe or a epilogue story where you travel west with the kid carrying the other kid's soul
[0:45:55] <alexandrecau> Kenji is the best character
[0:45:58] <%chiazam> @jorniev Yuna or Masako
[0:46:02] <Hammatime8> @jorniev The horse Kappa
[0:46:04] <+evbites> but fromsoft dlc always sprinkles in the cool shit like artorias and lady maria and the actual dark soul
[0:46:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It was a great idea
[0:46:27] <+bupkisoffthechain> justice for Ryuzo
[0:46:44] <%ChoculaUltra> whoa hey ease off on Ryuzo, Woolie's barely there.
[0:46:45] <+evbites> FUCK RYUZO
[0:46:57] <%MyBulletsLAG> Oh man a dlc where you played as Isshin in his rise to glory would have been awesome too
[0:47:00] <+evbites> with his dumb beak
[0:47:00] <%ChoculaUltra> (but all the homies do hate Ryuzo tho)
[0:47:12] <%chiazam> Woolie doesn't read chat, but people in the chat read chat, so no spoilers
[0:47:15] <+evbites> and lizard spit
[0:47:16] <+bupkisoffthechain> hes underrated
[0:47:18] <Kahpoe_Lelou> @bupkisoffthechain homie just wanna feed da shawteeess bawkFeels bawkFeels bawkFeels
[0:47:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stop implying things. Ryuzo is a beloved trustworthy childhood friend.
[0:47:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> swipe up
[0:47:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ride with horse
[0:47:43] <+bupkisoffthechain> Exaclty, he has mouths to feed, and people to care for
[0:48:00] <%chiazam> Woolie's insistence to walk everywhere is killing me right now
[0:48:18] <Kahpoe_Lelou> also good weeb hat for fashion. bawkGlad
[0:48:20] <+evbites> Fucking ryzuo his whole inclusion ruins the game with his sister complex and poorly written naruto shit
[0:48:26] <%ChoculaUltra> maybe him and the horse are having a lover's quarrel
[0:48:27] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:48:30] <%toastybites> bruh
[0:48:44] <+evbites> and thats how you prvent spoliers just make shit up
[0:48:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hooooorse
[0:48:53] <+bupkisoffthechain> @evbites am I forgetting? what sister?
[0:49:01] <Hammatime8> "Jin why the fuck are you taking your clothes off" "I was gonna take a quick bath"
[0:49:03] <+thackattack00> He fell for it LUL
[0:49:03] <+bupkisoffthechain> oh nvm i just got it lol
[0:49:09] <+jmstwn> Is ishikawa Jiraiya?
[0:49:10] <Kahpoe_Lelou> bawkAy bawkAy bawkAy bawkAy
[0:49:17] <%Irridium> know what's sick? when NPC's start talking but then you get to where you need to go and they cut themselves off
[0:49:28] <bunnyscruff> When Ryuzo ended up killing his sister for the sharingan it was cool
[0:49:32] <%MyBulletsLAG> I can't believe Ryuzo made that guy eat raw meat and got that other guy fired
[0:49:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[0:49:51] <%eyezehuhh> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:49:55] <alexandrecau> they scared
[0:49:58] <Halospaz117> Man I love standoffs
[0:50:06] <ELFucilaNeroIV> They scurred
[0:50:06] <%chiazam> Starting every fight with full Resolve, god Jin TOO OP PLS NERF
[0:50:08] <+bupkisoffthechain> I hated the part where Kenji commited tax fraud
[0:50:18] <+thackattack00> I hit a moment in this game where it played like 6 lines of dialogue concurrently because I climbed a ledge too fast
[0:50:20] <Hammatime8> That was so GOOD
[0:50:21] <+evbites> It was cool how he saved jin from thae volcanoes though
[0:50:27] <masterfire23> reload sword
[0:50:30] <bunnyscruff> Kenji absolutely would
[0:50:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he would actually
[0:50:42] <jorniev> ARROWS
[0:51:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:51:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[0:51:09] <%toastybites> finally LUL
[0:51:12] <Halospaz117> Ok so Ishikawa is a wizard
[0:51:13] <alexandrecau> Woolie you made this old man walk for no reason
[0:51:15] <Reizie_Etherealm> Is this the power of a RENTAL??
[0:51:22] <+evbites> kenji would think he was doing taxes but in reality just went to a whorehouse
[0:51:30] <%chiazam> Even in Hard mode where I take more damage, it just ends up with me using more Resolve than normal, and I still win
[0:51:31] <+bupkisoffthechain> I would prefer if he just teleported like slenderman
[0:51:46] <%MyBulletsLAG> Ishikawa is the founder of capsule corp
[0:52:13] <Kahpoe_Lelou> samurai horse obtained zero shift
[0:52:17] <%toastybites> @bupkisoffthechain imaging you're on the horse, you look back, and Ishikawa just t-pose bamfing
[0:52:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah npcs usually fuck up standoffs
[0:52:23] <alexandrecau> yes while he stabs woolie stance change fast
[0:52:29] <%bread_assassin> Stances are REALLY important.
[0:52:41] <+bupkisoffthechain> @toastybites IM COMIN FOR YOU TOMOE
[0:52:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hold
[0:52:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:52:54] <GeneralSCPatton> If only there was a way to highlight enemies in red through cover
[0:53:00] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> I've notice as i get further in the game i stopped trying to kill a certain way and instead kill the way that comes natural to me
[0:53:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:53:07] <alexandrecau> fuck he is far
[0:53:14] <%ChoculaUltra> WHAT
[0:53:18] <+evbites> i once had a bandit interrupt a standoff felt very legit for the main argument of the story
[0:53:42] <%chiazam> Min should tell Woolie about the Concentration perk
[0:53:54] <brunoberserk> he kills goutetsu
[0:53:56] <bunnyscruff> Man I love the stealth in this game, it's so sick
[0:54:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> Just like Kiryu
[0:54:02] <+evbites> really?
[0:54:04] <%MyBulletsLAG> I had a bird land on my opponent's shoulder during a standoff lol
[0:54:05] <%jiggy_snipe> didn't he blow up that ship?
[0:54:07] <naterrr72> yo yo yo versus gang! longtime anime watcher first time manga reader!!!
[0:54:10] <Djinnazz> lol
[0:54:11] <Hideow> Even sagat killed more people
[0:54:19] <%RunningNGunning> Akuma and Kiryu have killed the same amount of people
[0:54:21] <+evbites> wait what thats lame
[0:54:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @naterrr72 welcome to the manga
[0:54:23] <%toastybites> Akuma has no street cred LUL
[0:54:29] <TheSaltminer> TIGER SHOTS FIRED
[0:54:30] <Djinnazz> JUST intent
[0:54:31] <alexandrecau> Not murder result
[0:54:34] <Kahpoe_Lelou> damn akuma stunt
[0:54:36] <Djinnazz> OOPS all Intent
[0:54:36] <%eyezehuhh> His real name is Clarence
[0:54:37] <%bakawindMTL> Meanwhile, Chun Li's dad is forever missing
[0:54:38] <%Irridium> ZERO results
[0:54:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> COULD IF I WANTED TO
[0:54:42] <+vaporousTippler> He killed Bison, but, well, that doesn't take.
[0:54:47] <+DappercatEsquire> It's killing intent, not "killing doing"
[0:54:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> H E L T H
[0:54:57] <%MyBulletsLAG> Akuma's a bitch all my homies hate Akuma
[0:55:06] <+pectusumbra> I mean to be fair it's Bison and he's bullshit
[0:55:08] <+evbites> the ability that is said to murder your soul ain't shit
[0:55:09] <Equirah> the fact he keeps not killing people only increases his intent, he's getting stronger LUL
[0:55:13] <jubejube56> Everyone knows the raging demon is just a form of chiropracting
[0:55:16] <T_Sasquatch> Reggie said my name and i panicked LUL
[0:55:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> crouch
[0:55:28] <%chiazam> Find the foot soldiers
[0:55:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> He's just saving his meter for the right opponent
[0:55:46] <Aussie_Manny> They mapped eagle vision to touchpad?! Huh.
[0:55:49] <brunoberserk> standoff = the ''FIGHT ME'' button
[0:55:53] <+Ace5335> saving meter for next round
[0:55:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie going for the nutshots
[0:56:02] <%RunningNGunning> The moment Akuma actually kills someone his body will deflate like a balloon
[0:56:03] <Halospaz117> In the dick Woolie?
[0:56:17] <+evbites> ryu don't be afraid of the raging demo t ain't shit you just look like an edgy teen's idea of cool
[0:56:19] <+Razputin217> Dammit Butters
[0:56:23] <JaseAdrift> woolie's aim aint half bad today
[0:56:35] <alexandrecau> spear fuckers are good when they have higher level
[0:56:59] <%illtima> Nioh trained Woolie for stance switching
[0:57:05] <jorniev> water stance?
[0:57:12] <+worldbuildwithus> Did woolie get the legendary draw technique yet?
[0:57:14] <Djinnazz> there's no auto heal
[0:57:14] <+evbites> not yet
[0:57:18] <%chiazam> Oh that guy is using A SHIELD
[0:57:25] <alexandrecau> Woolie you need to press on when the stance is broken
[0:57:26] <NeoCre> I can‚Äôt wait till they start fighting the high levels. All that talk about lock-on is just gonna stop
[0:57:42] <alexandrecau> there is no stamina meter Jin will swing to the death
[0:57:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> I have the regen charm and never have to heal in a fight
[0:57:52] <+seduwu> Woolie keep hitting them
[0:58:02] <jorniev> i wonder if a musashi game would have been better?

[0:58:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> @alexandrecau What are you talking about? Everyone knows that you don't press the advantage, you relent in honorable cowardice.
[0:59:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I like how it still shows the hud of stance progress
[0:59:17] <+evbites> sensie why is your energy purple?
[0:59:19] <alexandrecau> @GeneralSCPatton honor is facefucking

[1:00:34] <NeoCre> Biggest honor is to start tossing grenades
[1:00:35] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, well, that's the same reason Max switched to English. Too distracting from gameplay. doodBait
[1:00:39] <DesertPenguin> Do what you want dude. Don't let people's salt get to you

[1:02:33] <pacifistcabbage> Golden Dragon #4
[1:02:44] <dinnydanny777> It's because his name is Banter
[1:02:44] <+pectusumbra> Used to have a place around here called The Golden Palace. The best Chinese food I ever ate. lots of special stuff and not lots of sauce
[1:02:50] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> I think this is the equivalent of naming Taco Bell. Lol
[1:02:51] <NeoCre> Nah, you get tons of meat at temples
[1:02:55] <%MyBulletsLAG> I'm gone for 5 seconds and now they're speaking English?
[1:02:56] <reonome> just got here, why did woolie switch to english
[1:03:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's trying it out
[1:03:06] <alexandrecau> because woolie is a coward
[1:03:11] <+evbites> reggie's temple has meet,gambling and kick girls
[1:03:15] <jubejube56> @reonome hard to play a game and read subtitles at the same time
[1:03:18] <+KR_Black> Oh i see Wollie stoped using the disonorable armor
[1:03:18] <Aussie_Manny> Dodge the arrows like Ultra Instinct.
[1:03:18] <%Irridium> he wanted to see what they were like
[1:03:21] <Reizie_Etherealm> The golden dragon sounds like a place jackie chan would fight at
[1:03:23] <%doomerskeletor13> He‚Äôs trying it out cause some times he misses subtitles
[1:03:30] <reonome> weeb traitor Kappa
[1:03:38] <NeoCre> Welp
[1:03:40] <%chiazam> He's aboutta be out of arrows
[1:03:43] <%MyBulletsLAG> And the subtitles don't always match what's being said too
[1:03:47] <+thebadpope> this nission is dope
[1:03:47] <alexandrecau> @evbites the kick girl make you lick their toes as they peg you in Reggie's temple
[1:03:48] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Just as a fun note, there's an American restaurant chain called "Golden Corral", which serves primarily western (American) dishes in a buffet all-you-can-eat fashion. It's just as bad as you imagine it is.
[1:03:55] <NeoCre> Shoulda assassinated
[1:04:05] <VidulaSaix> With as much dialogue as this game has I dont feel sub works at all. You almost constantly need to be looking at subs to keep up

[1:04:15] <DSD24> Doojo
[1:04:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Woolie refusing to use the focused hearing. At this point I'm sure that he literally doesn't know what mechanic Minh is directing him to use.
[1:04:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Everytime you hear ‚ÄúDOSHO‚Äù that means an arrow is incoming
[1:04:21] <+evbites> Where did the pegging lore come from?
[1:04:21] <Djinnazz> yup
[1:04:26] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Omg woolie
[1:04:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> loot the bodies
[1:04:35] <alexandrecau> thousand door lp

[1:04:58] <VidulaSaix> Tocuh Pad woolie
[1:04:58] <%doomerskeletor13> @evbites Reggie made a joke about enjoying pegging
[1:05:01] <VidulaSaix> Helps find them easier
[1:05:02] <jorniev> LEAVES
[1:05:03] <jubejube56> Never enough leaves
[1:05:08] <alexandrecau> Reggie mentions the only way to look at the poster as you make love is by being pegged
[1:05:13] <+evbites> damn ttyd is just unleashing 100 years of dank lore
[1:05:18] <jorniev> SO MANY LEAVES
[1:05:23] <%doomerskeletor13> In Japan it‚Äôs constantly raining leaves

[1:06:14] <alexandrecau> and your godfather is a fox
[1:06:19] <%doomerskeletor13> You can swim in any wtaer
[1:06:23] <%doomerskeletor13> *water
[1:06:28] <jubejube56> Weird to play a Sucker Punch game where the water is safe
[1:06:34] <jorniev> yeah connor
[1:06:35] <VidulaSaix> No Woolie, TOUCH it
[1:06:36] <DSD24> I'm pretty sure the Mongol's can't swim
[1:06:38] <VidulaSaix> Not swipe
[1:06:47] <+KR_Black> Why would you make the pick up and the jump from the clif the same freaking button
[1:06:47] <Aussie_Manny> Just like that terrible Assassin's Creed protagonist.
[1:06:49] <%thechungiestofbois> @jubejube56 Second Son you could jump in
[1:06:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> BOI
[1:06:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[1:07:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Most important mechanic rediscovered
[1:07:03] <dinnydanny777> And now to kill the boy
[1:07:06] <+evbites> and your uncle is the shame you feel during stealth
[1:07:08] <jubejube56> Ahh and thats the one that passed me by
[1:07:11] <jorniev> I DO
[1:07:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Time to kill the boy
[1:07:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> I do
[1:07:16] <+thebadpope> Woolie's still got his deluxe edition Rick Ross Mink on.
[1:07:18] <Aussie_Manny> 3 was BAD.
[1:07:20] <T_Sasquatch> Looooool
[1:07:22] <penitentpentwitch> The way of the Stealthurai
[1:07:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> His village was burned
[1:07:26] <dinnydanny777> His dad was unironically more interesting
[1:07:27] <DSD24> Look at this Boy
[1:07:31] <T_Sasquatch> Tomahawk was cool okay
[1:07:32] <NireFuster> Did Woolie get the cutscene where the guy says 'striking from the shadows is cowardly'? I just joined
[1:07:34] <%thechungiestofbois> I do
[1:07:35] <jorniev> 3 was bad but fun
[1:07:37] <alexandrecau> man he talks soft in English
[1:07:39] <%doomerskeletor13> His dad was so much cooler lmao
[1:07:39] <+steelmorrigan> good lod I can't escpaet this game *lol* in the best way
[1:07:41] <CrazyMedicine> now cut the bridge down
[1:07:45] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Man Assassin's Creed III story about connor was so good. He had to put up with so much BS. I was so happy the sanctuary storyline had such a good ending.
[1:07:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @NireFuster not yet
[1:07:50] <LeBlanc233> What could have been
[1:07:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but he hasn't done much stealth yet
[1:07:57] <jorniev> KNEEING british into lakes was fun
[1:08:06] <%emperordread> "Assassin's Creed should have been more interesting" is a theme of the series
[1:08:07] <NireFuster> I see
[1:08:07] <ky_79> Wait why did he change to English?
[1:08:08] <%thechungiestofbois> Connor is a character you hate if you don't play the homestead missions
[1:08:20] <LoneFonte> @ky_79 he wanted to check it out
[1:08:24] <Thelovelybison> I think I like the dub for the most part besides Jin‚Äôs VA. I much prefer his Japanese voice
[1:08:29] <+DarkNerdShawny> Wait, I came back to ENGLISH? Why the change, and I love it!!
[1:08:33] <alexandrecau> IT is the honorable way to say yes but shut up
[1:08:36] <%doomerskeletor13> @ky_79 He misses subtitles while he‚Äôs playing sometimes, he‚Äôs testing out the English
[1:08:43] <+evbites> i wanted shay to meet arno soooo hard
[1:08:47] <Hammatime8> "Did you hear them cry for their god with their dying breath?"
[1:08:50] <VidulaSaix> English is fantastic in this game, and it's very hard to keep track with sub cause there's so much dialogue
[1:08:55] <dinnydanny777> Assassin's Creed 3 is alright to me because it's one of the few games set in the US where someone calls out that the Founding Fathers were slave owning hypocritical bastards
[1:08:56] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Ending of Connor realizing the founding fathers were hypocrites was fantastic.
[1:08:57] <xbb1024> hello!
[1:09:02] <%thechungiestofbois> The modern day of AC is a fucking mess now
[1:09:04] <jubejube56> The game clearly just doesn't like SNAFU is all
[1:09:06] <%chiazam> Just don't take damage
[1:09:17] <%Calenrow> reggie laughing at the "fucks shrine"
[1:09:24] <%doomerskeletor13> @professor_dr_muffins One of the few parts of the game I liked!
[1:09:26] <DSD24> Didn't they cut a ending monologue for Connor?
[1:09:40] <+evbites> also the those came before is all over the place too
[1:09:47] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Woolie needs glasses confirmed?
[1:09:49] <%chiazam> Let's you parry more shit
[1:09:56] <VidulaSaix> Honestly anything is the right choice. Almost every ability is super super good
[1:09:59] <%thechungiestofbois> I hate how people call the english version the "dub". Like this game was made in the majectic land of Seattle, Nippon.
[1:10:02] <%doomerskeletor13> I went to so many hot springs to boost my health
[1:10:03] <%vVAstrAVv> parry unblockables are op get them ASAP
[1:10:13] <Archmortal> There's SO MUCH good shit
[1:10:26] <%masterpiecejeremy> when woolie ignores the foxes BibleThump
[1:10:28] <dinnydanny777> @lewdskeletor13 I'm sure that was why :)
[1:10:31] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> I think so... but I remember him having two ending monologues... the BS of america, and the city he made of people who stoodunderstood each other and got along well.
[1:10:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> You do not want to rely on dodge cause you need to take the right thumb off the camera for it
[1:10:47] <%doomerskeletor13> The best part of the English voice track is that it isn‚Äôt a bunch of white guys doing accents
[1:10:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> >not prioritizing the Guiding Wind options. How will he ever find the good stuff?
[1:11:04] <+DarkNerdShawny> Minh is wrong right now btw
[1:11:05] <Archmortal> He's trying to min-max exploration
[1:11:06] <%doomerskeletor13> @dinnydanny777 ;) other reasons too
[1:11:07] <alexandrecau> just take the bridge ten hour man
[1:11:09] <+CptBritches> :)
[1:11:11] <%thechungiestofbois> yeah, the cast is all Japanese actors in english
[1:11:17] <VidulaSaix> Minh just let him explore lol
[1:11:25] <%chiazam> THERE'S SO MUCH OF THAT
[1:11:33] <DSD24> @lewdskeletor13 Yeah its not the popular va's
[1:11:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> The random encounters are like red dead redemption
[1:11:52] <%doomerskeletor13> God I can‚Äôt wait till Miles Morales breebuPog
[1:11:56] <%chiazam> It's not that easy to miss
[1:12:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> ZENMETSU
[1:12:14] <Make_me_mad> I actually don't like the showdown's that much. I'd rather fight the dudes straight up than quicktime them to death.
[1:12:14] <xbb1024> oh cool, he got the triple upgrade
[1:12:14] <NireFuster> JUDGEMENT CUT
[1:12:15] <ELFucilaNeroIV> These games don't want the player going through long stretches of doing nothing.
[1:12:16] <+evbites> in spiderman the cops are either fuck off spiderman or are super fans
[1:12:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Wait till they start doing feint attacks, it‚Äôll fuck you up
[1:12:26] <%chiazam> There's actually quite a few Asian VA's on this game
[1:12:29] <jorniev> YES YES TOVARISH split it wide open!
[1:12:37] <VidulaSaix> LARGE LAD
[1:12:54] <Parapattern> Clean
[1:12:56] <DSD24> I know Jin's VA is streaming the game, and that's rad
[1:12:58] <%Sixtoe> Sixtoe subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:13:03] <+Razputin217> Absolute Unit
[1:13:06] <VidulaSaix> Oh is he? Thats cool
[1:13:07] <%chiazam> The dodge attack is best for that
[1:13:10] <VidulaSaix> Jins VA does a great job
[1:13:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I just unlocked the last stance yesterday
[1:13:17] <%thechungiestofbois> Jin's VA seing Jin's Ass is an experience
[1:13:22] <alexandrecau> IT's not dark souls
[1:13:24] <%doomerskeletor13> @sjay449 LUL
[1:13:31] <jobin_stream> @jorniev it's time for Jin to lit it rip
[1:13:35] <%chiazam> @sjay449 You got a link?
[1:13:42] <DSD24> No always STRIKE
[1:13:44] <VidulaSaix> What you just did was pretty much the perfect way to play this games combat
[1:13:45] <%thechungiestofbois> Am I allowed to link in twitch?
[1:13:46] <Djinnazz> yeah, there's non of that now, lol
[1:13:49] <VidulaSaix> So you've already got it down
[1:13:51] <alexandrecau> it'S assassin's creed there is no stamina and you can't let them regain their stasnce
[1:13:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CRICKET
[1:13:58] <jorniev> i used to think my sword was tool for justice
[1:13:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:14:00] <%chiazam> @sjay449 Just pm me
[1:14:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> nah just spam this is triple a
[1:14:01] <%gambit_gamble> Always be striking woolie
[1:14:05] <Parapattern> That's literally Sekiro
[1:14:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> Understandable, dark souls punishes you for that
[1:14:12] <%doomerskeletor13> I don‚Äôt even block that much, I just dodge and go in hard
[1:14:12] <jorniev> not used for vengence
[1:14:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it lets you play other songs to change weather
[1:14:21] <DSD24> I love the jump kick in this game
[1:14:23] <%thechungiestofbois> Youtube "Jin Sakai's ass" and it's the first result
[1:14:27] <+evbites> crickets
[1:14:28] <NireFuster> But the big guys don't stagger from attacks so ou can't just keep attacking right?
[1:14:30] <+Twon_From_Wakanda> Jin does not respect his elders Kappa
[1:14:32] <%chiazam> Everytime I play a song, the weather doesn't change
[1:14:39] <%JustYudha> This game is probably triggering your Sekiro skills @WoolieVersus
[1:14:41] <ELFucilaNeroIV> DS has made me patient when doing combat.
[1:14:41] <alexandrecau> Even the big guy can be staggered
[1:14:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh Some quests lock the weather
[1:14:53] <VidulaSaix> Constantly
[1:14:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> ALWAYS
[1:14:59] <DSD24> All the time
[1:15:04] <KidKaiser23> @alexandrecau ‚ÄúIf he bleeds, he staggers‚Äù
[1:15:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This game would be better is you could ride a skateboard instead of a horse
[1:15:05] <%chiazam> @GeneralSCPatton Even when I'm not in a quest
[1:15:18] <%doomerskeletor13> I don‚Äôt use it that often unless I have to use stealth

[1:37:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> OH NO..

[1:38:15] <jorniev> YOU ARE FACE
[1:38:16] <theCoolChild> the story changes weather and time to match what it needs sometimes
[1:38:21] <jorniev> TO FACE
[1:38:21] <+evbites> theme of baby crushing
[1:38:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> none
[1:38:32] <DSD24> If you are stealthy then the weather changes to reflect that
[1:38:32] <Reizie_Etherealm> Lady Masako's plot line does the revenge bad thing better than TLOU2, change my mind
[1:38:32] <Djinnazz> all of it.
[1:38:35] <%doomerskeletor13> @dancenorigins Well this was developed here in the west but it‚Äôs set in Japan. And also really well received in Japan
[1:38:35] <+thackattack00> none of it lol
[1:38:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> WITH THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD
[1:38:37] <DianaTheAscian> all of it
[1:38:38] <Djinnazz> The whole Island
[1:38:38] <%ChoculaUltra> was that an albino ox or is that just the lighting
[1:38:40] <alexandrecau> None but his uncle is a jito
[1:38:49] <T_Sasquatch> Keep playing the gameeeee
[1:38:49] <%M3djedx> woolieYE
[1:38:52] <%doomerskeletor13> His uncle was the Jito
[1:38:52] <+DappercatEsquire> Sakai clan's castle is to the north
[1:38:53] <+arancet> uncle was big boss of the island, but jin's clan specifically had a bit in the north
[1:38:55] <alexandrecau> So basically now he owns the whole island
[1:39:01] <dinnydanny777> Tsushima
[1:39:02] <%vVAstrAVv> jins clan was in the middle area
[1:39:04] <Make_me_mad> A lot of things do the revenge bad plotline better than TLOU2.
[1:39:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait did clan sakai just kinda get absorbed into clan shimura?
[1:39:13] <+evbites> no mongels own the island
[1:39:20] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @cobalt_phoenix_ Yeah basically
[1:39:23] <DesertPenguin> ONE GUY
[1:39:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah
[1:39:31] <alexandrecau> Not absorbed but Jin was too young to lead it
[1:39:36] <dinnydanny777> Jin calls people peasants
[1:39:37] <splinter1619> remember to be honurabul
[1:39:44] <oneimportantthing> OneGuy of Tsushima

[1:42:31] <splinter1619> there is HUGE customizations
[1:42:39] <DesertPenguin> you can mix and match?
[1:42:41] <alexandrecau> This game is pure eye candy
[1:42:48] <%chiazam> In-game glamour options
[1:42:52] <splinter1619> I dont get it. there isnt microtransactions why is this good for the consumer
[1:42:55] <DSD24> Yeah you can mix
[1:42:58] <+evbites> i love lightweight armor and shitty traveler
[1:43:03] <DesertPenguin> ye
[1:43:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> helmets and masks are just cosmetics
[1:43:08] <+Arkfyre> only armour gives you stats
[1:43:19] <Djinnazz> Travelers in pure while is the sex.
[1:43:22] <sendart> wind woolie wind
[1:43:22] <alexandrecau> I love patchwork straw hat
[1:43:22] <NireFuster> I don't think most armor stuff will give you stats woolie, I think it's all cosmetic
[1:43:22] <LeBlanc233> I hope theirs like a Ronin set
[1:43:23] <Jrocy247> Man I can't wait till he gets a straw hat
[1:43:24] <%chiazam> Only the armor pieces have stats
[1:43:28] <splinter1619> I have gone the past 7 hours of this game and havent seen jins face
[1:43:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> That get up reminds me of hiroyuki sanada in the last samurai
[1:43:41] <splinter1619> I straight up forgot what he looked like
[1:43:45] <alexandrecau> @LeBlanc233 there is it makes you high damage low ef
[1:43:46] <+evbites> @LeBlanc233 there are two
[1:43:47] <DSD24> @splinter1619 I like having the mask on
[1:43:47] <%chiazam> He's gonna freak out when he gets the straw hats
[1:43:48] <medril07> the wind is pushing me!
[1:43:55] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Travelers outfit is my prefered one when doing side content.
[1:43:56] <%CursedNobleman> HUGE VIBRATION Kreygasm
[1:43:56] <Hammatime8> That's a pretty classy look right there
[1:43:57] <jorniev> YELLOW
[1:44:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no not that one
[1:44:05] <VidulaSaix> No Minh that's the other armor
[1:44:05] <splinter1619> @dsd24 it makes me feel powerful
[1:44:10] <oneimportantthing> Use wind
[1:44:13] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> thats only if you are wearing a traveler outfit
[1:44:17] <+Arkfyre> not that armour he's wearing
[1:44:22] <EMP_SoloSagat> that's travelers armor
[1:44:22] <%stormhawk9891> He doesn't have that yet
[1:44:29] <+Razputin217> Not this one
[1:44:31] <%chiazam> Noope
[1:44:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I have a feeling he might like the traveler's armor
[1:44:40] <Parapattern> Sogen These NUTS!
[1:44:43] <Reizie_Etherealm> That face tho
[1:44:47] <%bread_assassin> In both good and bad, Mihn is like if chat had a voice.
[1:44:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> He's lookin' FISH
[1:44:53] <EMP_SoloSagat> woolie seems like a cape guy
[1:44:57] <alexandrecau> Traitorous rebels
[1:45:00] <splinter1619> travelers attire lvl 3 is fucking stronk

[1:45:32] <thesickestzak> Sweeping this under the rug
[1:45:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> The intense stare makes him seem suspicious
[1:46:04] <splinter1619> LIBERATION

[1:48:12] <jorniev> OH GOD ONE OF THESE MISSIONS
[1:48:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hope you like tailing missions
[1:48:16] <alexandrecau> honorable masako with the scheme
[1:48:17] <viridianowl> Sure is AssCreed around here Kappa
[1:48:18] <%chiazam> TRAILING MISSION
[1:48:25] <DSD24> This one isn't bad
[1:48:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> A tailing mission in the year of our lord 2020???
[1:48:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[1:48:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Least favorite parts of the game lmao
[1:48:31] <+evbites> i smell heresy ztbHeresy
[1:48:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Glad video games haven't changed in 13 years
[1:48:31] <%ChoculaUltra> there's actually a fair bit of these in the game
[1:48:32] <%BisoromiBear> bow to nature
[1:48:41] <+Doc1790> That happens to me a lot
[1:48:41] <splinter1619> not gonna lie I didnt actually mind the trailing missions that much
[1:48:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> alright chat what's worse, tailing mission or escort mission?
[1:48:49] <DSD24> Trailing missions are bad in games with vehicles
[1:48:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> tailing
[1:48:54] <+evbites> escort
[1:48:54] <DSD24> This is fine
[1:48:55] <Drusain> tailing
[1:48:58] <splinter1619> escort mission is worse by far
[1:49:02] <alexandrecau> No wonder everyone starves they drop supplies everywhere
[1:49:02] <%ChoculaUltra> track person and track actual footprints quests galore ResidentSleeper
[1:49:03] <dinnydanny777> Trailing missions are fine if they're easy
[1:49:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:49:07] <%jiggy_snipe> tough choice
[1:49:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> AssCreed Revelations has both at the same time
[1:49:17] <Hammatime8> DEER
[1:49:18] <DSD24> Oh deer
[1:49:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> @dsd24 don't remind me of the tailing missions in LA Noire NotLikeThis
[1:49:21] <Parapattern> The worst trailing mission is in The Legend of Zelda BoTW
[1:49:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> You think that's bad? There's supplies on ledges of a cliff face LUL
[1:49:30] <NireFuster> It's a good thing the monk is fucking blind and can't see that he's clearly being followed
[1:49:31] <%BisoromiBear> she's in the kamui dimension
[1:49:34] <DSD24> @FuqBoiSlim That's the poster child for bad tailing missions
[1:49:37] <%ChoculaUltra> @Parapattern the one in the Lost Woods on the island?
[1:49:46] <+evbites> or escort and trailing mixed together where you have to take care of enemies without getting noticed
[1:49:49] <Parapattern> @ChoculaUltra Yep
[1:50:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Yeah that trailing mission can eat a bag of dicks.
[1:50:09] <IntrepidEye> tailing is the worst when the game bitches at you to stay within a VERY specific distance and a foot to close or far is instant fail
[1:50:10] <Prevot> judgement was just that same awful assassin's creed tailing
[1:50:16] <jorniev> ASS CREED TAILING
[1:50:17] <stardustcrusad3r> whats the lore behind the woolie hole
[1:50:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh did Woolie play Judgement?
[1:50:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> crouching is only for visibility
[1:50:24] <DSD24> Yes he did
[1:50:30] <alexandrecau> he made a quick view
[1:50:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not those brushes but the pampas yes
[1:50:43] <dinnydanny777> Woolie he barely even turns around
[1:50:55] <dinnydanny777> This is barely even a tailing mission, just follow him
[1:51:11] <splinter1619> you dont even have to be in the pampas so long as your close enough and they are between you and him
[1:51:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> 180 degree vision cone
[1:51:18] <alexandrecau> traitors
[1:51:19] <Reizie_Etherealm> FOOLISHNESS
