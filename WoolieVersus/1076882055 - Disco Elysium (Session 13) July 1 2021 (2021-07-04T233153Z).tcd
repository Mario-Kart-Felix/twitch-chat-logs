[0:00:48] <+arcforged> Eh
[0:00:49] <BigFingerRo> I was gonna say, they must've been hard up for money to give away hardware like that, but it wasn't money , just not being able to pay with money
[0:00:53] <%X2Eliah> Can-eh-da
[0:00:53] <Sonicdy> Eh day
[0:00:58] <insertedgynamehere___> Hello there Woolie
[0:01:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> Reggie with the Vergil hair back
[0:01:07] <BigFingerRo> WOOLIE, COCO GRADUATED :((((((
[0:01:08] <seycheles> happy woolie day!
[0:01:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hey, you can celebrate the good parts of your country and still want it to be better
[0:01:25] <+Mendin> Churches burning down
[0:01:28] <@Solidus_113> it's bad
[0:01:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> As an american, just take the excuse to have a little cookout
[0:01:31] <@Solidus_113> it's pain
[0:01:37] <+Sir_Louis> it's not happy :(
[0:01:38] <%X2Eliah> Reggie, Vergil's hairstyle really suits ya
[0:01:39] <DonatelloJose> @bigfingerro bro, I’m here to forget.
[0:01:45] <%Vigonept> She wasnt kicked out, she quit
[0:01:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's an idol thing iirc
[0:01:49] <@Solidus_113> It's Idol Culture, basically retiring
[0:01:49] <%Juriasu> eh, it's the first one *basically*
[0:01:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> sounds like she retired?
[0:02:03] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Why do they call it graduation? Like they're school kids. Feels weird
[0:02:03] <%alpharius88> it's "sunsetting"
[0:02:04] <miucsa51> Welcome to Idol Culture
[0:02:06] <%servicesuspension> it IS weird
[0:02:06] <%X2Eliah> Who's coco? Coco chanel?
[0:02:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @X2Eliah vtuber
[0:02:15] <DonatelloJose> Wow that’s an ignorant take
[0:02:16] <%harmadill0> Are they "Promised Neverland" ing these VTubers? What is this about lol
[0:02:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> @X2Eliah popular vtuber, dragon girl
[0:02:23] <Sonicdy> COCO: RETIRED
[0:02:25] <joebeilieves> It’s Woolie stoned???
[0:02:27] <aiutare47> She left, not sure why.
[0:02:29] <@Solidus_113> She quit for personal reasons, which everyone assumes was because of Antis
[0:02:30] <%servicesuspension> Coco Chanel was a nazi, so I hope no one feels sad for her
[0:02:34] <%alpharius88> it's corporate for "fired"
[0:02:35] <%Lion_kun> She chose to quit. She was bringing them millions of yen lol
[0:02:35] <%Vigonept> RETIRED WILLINGLY
[0:02:44] <%Juriasu> she seems like she didn't really like all the restictions so I'm happy that she found a way out without being erased from history
[0:02:58] <+Bobbledygook> Open ze game!
[0:02:59] <%X2Eliah> That's like "moving up" from NXT to Raw/Smackdown
[0:03:00] <+Sir_Louis> She left on her own decision, careful with the rrats
[0:03:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> "GOOD MORNING, MOTHERFUCKERS!"
[0:03:04] <%servicesuspension> Woolie here pretending he ain't an idol
[0:03:09] <+Mendin> @Solidus_113 She mentioned she was having Impostor Syndrome issues more than that compared to other idols
[0:03:20] <@Solidus_113> Coco is one the most superchatted/donated girls on youtube
[0:03:20] <+edgeyberzerker> 3 raiders from edgeyberzerker have joined! 
[0:03:23] <%derap41> Just a new voice actor there
[0:03:24] <BigFingerRo> Why don't you fly your Toronto Leafs flag today , Woolz? Seems like the right day to do it
[0:03:24] <die_hardman> @servicesuspension ironically or really was?
[0:03:24] <%X2Eliah> Ya but theold granny voice
[0:03:30] <Prevot> she wasn't kicked out buuuut she's obviously leaving cause of how they restricted her post Taiwan incident
[0:03:37] <%Vigonept> She retired woolie willingly
[0:03:37] <+drakthebest> Chat saying she willingly left
[0:03:38] <%servicesuspension> @die_hardman collaborator, yeah
[0:03:39] <vasily_kardanov> The company owns the character
[0:03:40] <DonatelloJose> You’re mistaken Woolie, she left on her terms do to her own thing.
[0:03:41] <%Juriasu> I remember that happened with Kizuna Ai she was played by multiple people and that really sucked
[0:03:48] <leith_aziz> Hi everybody
[0:03:57] <@Solidus_113> idol culture
[0:03:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> PR?
[0:03:58] <twoto858> That's just a term
[0:04:01] <twoto858> It's a bad term
[0:04:03] <+Sir_Louis> it's just what it's called
[0:04:05] <leith_aziz> I guess I missed out on some convos
[0:04:05] <+drakthebest> Idol terms are just creepy man
[0:04:07] <%Vigonept> its just a word
[0:04:09] <%servicesuspension> it's a creepy ass term!
[0:04:10] <BabblingBayou> That's just how they called it
[0:04:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> Probably the company doing PR moves
[0:04:17] <+Mendin> It's the "Future Endeavors" of Hololive, Woolie
[0:04:20] <%mariothemaio> it would be more honest, but lol Idol Culture
[0:04:21] <%Lion_kun> China branch got to keep their models.
[0:04:26] <%derap41> Is it toasty ?
[0:04:26] <+Exicuren> "Graduation" is the same as "letting go"
[0:04:28] <%harmadill0> "you're graduating from employee to customer"
[0:04:29] <%Vigonept> how bout them children
[0:04:29] <+jayayanami> NotLikeThis
[0:04:34] <%Lion_kun> She chose to quit, Woolz
[0:04:35] <%ekodrop> is anything about idols honest?
[0:04:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> irl idols call it graduation, and hololive are idol-like so yeah
[0:04:39] <%servicesuspension> Vtuber Woolie could stream from the inversion table, though
[0:04:39] <+arcforged> angry*
[0:04:43] <leith_aziz> What, is this about Coc?
[0:04:47] <leith_aziz> *Coco
[0:04:49] <+arcforged> Reggie looks nagry lol
[0:04:51] <%Lion_kun> She made hololive millions
[0:04:53] <Picia000123> eh, it didn't have to be the reason
[0:04:54] <+Exicuren> same level of hiding BS that you are resigning or being fired
[0:04:54] <DonatelloJose> Cover does not want to poke the bear again probably. Coward? Maybe.
[0:04:54] <@Solidus_113> nothing to do with age
[0:05:00] <%LCLSmoothie> LCLSmoothie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! HARD CORE! AIIIIIIGGGHHHH
[0:05:00] <%Lion_kun> No way they'd fire her.
[0:05:01] <+harmadill0> Inversion table would be great content lol
[0:05:08] <+drakthebest> Reggie looks more and more like black Vergil with every passing day
[0:05:14] <aiutare47> @woolieversus no one knows why she left. No one would say publicly anyway. Maybe she just wanted to do something else. We could speculate all day.
[0:05:17] <%derpy_platypus> people are fooling themselves saying the harassment wasn't part of it
[0:05:25] <%derap41> That didn't create torrent of abuse or anything
[0:05:30] <Chatterbox1991> Michael Jackson?
[0:05:31] <miucsa51> Reggie is finally becoming vergil
[0:05:35] <@Solidus_113> Coco is the biggest reason the English branch exists, she's done an incredible amount for the industry as a whole
[0:05:35] <DonatelloJose> She was Gen 4 and super popular. She wasn’t pushed out the door. She left.
[0:05:39] <leith_aziz> Context on conversation, chat?
[0:05:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> That kinda thing was going on in the 60s with Motown and even before then
[0:05:56] <%Juriasu> @leith_aziz vtubers
[0:05:56] <%Lion_kun> Not saying the antis weren't part of coco's decision but she chose to retire.
[0:05:58] <%Vigonept> no ones saying the tawain shit wasnt a part of it. but she chose to leave and wasnt booted
[0:05:58] <%derap41> We talking Britney Spears now?
[0:06:01] <Chatterbox1991> @leith_aziz Britinany Spears' estate has been hijacked by her family
[0:06:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:06:01] <leith_aziz> Im guessing this is about Coco the V-tuber quitting?
[0:06:02] <%servicesuspension> hololive vtuber retiring, she's a big deal, a million dollar asset
[0:06:03] <BigFingerRo> @derpy_platypus Another much smaller vtuber just graduated also because she got fuckin death threats
[0:06:05] <die_hardman> @leith_aziz vtuber that left
[0:06:14] <%X2Eliah> @leith_aziz idk, some "dragon" "vtuber" "graduated" or something?
[0:06:19] <+harmadill0> Woolie revealed he was coco the whole time
[0:06:21] <leith_aziz> Yeah, that's what I thought
[0:06:23] <%Lion_kun> Yagoo even said Coco was welcome to guest cameo.
[0:06:27] <%smyld> @miucsa51 “I need more feeeet”
[0:06:28] <%derap41> Individualism and humanism is dying
[0:06:28] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> LUL
[0:06:30] <+Exicuren> Pretty sure no one is hiding that the Taiwan situation is not part of it, but is not the only reason why she left
[0:06:54] <%derap41> The author isn't dead he's never born
[0:06:55] <%servicesuspension> there's such a thing as being too honest
[0:06:58] <leith_aziz> I mean, she quit on her own terms, right? So it sounds like nothing happened that forced her hands or anything
[0:06:59] <%LCLSmoothie> we need a GG Allin style vtuber
[0:07:00] <%heysamuel> i think that's the only sentence "gg allin" and "pure" could every feasibly go together
[0:07:02] <aiutare47> @x2eliah extremely popular vtuber retired. Speculation ensues because the company didn’t make much of a public statement.
[0:07:07] <%prime_name> There are plenty of translated videos of Coco saying why she chose to graduate
[0:07:08] <leith_aziz> At least, I hope nothing happenmed
[0:07:11] <leith_aziz> *happened
[0:07:13] <%kyh9> The opposite of a GG Allen work is a Marvel Movie
[0:07:25] <@Solidus_113> that's not how it works
[0:07:32] <miucsa51> and now we are getting corpo vtubers with sonic
[0:07:35] <%kyh9> It's because she talked about Taiwan
[0:07:38] <+Sabbington> First time catching you live ever, this disco elysium playthrough rips
[0:07:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i hope coco keeps streaming on her own channel
[0:07:45] <@Solidus_113> She will
[0:07:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yay!
[0:07:51] <miucsa51> what's next vatican vtubers?
[0:07:51] <%kyh9> Bladerunner
[0:07:54] <%kyh9> BLADE RUNNER
[0:07:56] <@Solidus_113> it's gaining traction
[0:07:57] <%Vigonept> oh god
[0:07:57] <ulcaban> Blade Runner rztirement
[0:07:58] <leith_aziz> I dont know much about V-tubers- I find Calli pretty cool and Gura is just funny
[0:08:01] <+harmadill0> "get the graduation shotgun it's time to graduate her"
[0:08:01] <%kyh9> Blade runner would 'retire' Replicants
[0:08:07] <%X2Eliah> "retired" is a good way to say "killed" or "fired the fuck off"
[0:08:09] <leith_aziz> I mean, Calli plays GG, so there's that
[0:08:15] <%servicesuspension> Asian companies can't do transparency, even when there's nothing to win from being obfuscating
[0:08:19] <%kyh9> We
[0:08:23] <vasily_kardanov> The point is she left because there were "creative differences" not because her contract expired or something
[0:08:27] <%kyh9> Getting retired for talking about Taiwan
[0:08:30] <%Lion_kun> What term would you prefer Woolie?
[0:08:30] <%servicesuspension> "future endeavors"
[0:08:31] <+jayayanami> oh she's not leaving, she's GRADUATING
[0:08:34] <ulcaban> Or the concept of 'release' from The Giver
[0:08:35] <+jayayanami> triTHICC
[0:08:36] <%Lion_kun> Shitcanned?
[0:08:46] <%prime_name> She wasn't kicked out, she wanted to go.
[0:08:53] <Sonicdy> Take a cu….wait wrong stream
[0:08:57] <%Vigonept> i mean, top charts in apple store vs not is a big deal
[0:08:57] <%Lion_kun> She chose to quit, she was not fired.
[0:09:01] <Chatterbox1991> Say what you will about Bieber, he done did it.
[0:09:04] <%servicesuspension> you can always sell out to china
[0:09:10] <%Juriasu> getting into an agency like hololive basically means free success though so I get it
[0:09:12] <%Lion_kun> She made hololive millions.
[0:09:18] <mr_sups> HARD CORE!
[0:09:19] <leith_aziz> Are we sure she left on her own, or where her hands forced
[0:09:19] <%nosubstancex> nosubstancex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! Much love from Brandon P and Maribel O
[0:09:27] <@Solidus_113> Graduations aren't because of contracts expiring, everyone who has left the vtuber space has done so either by their own free will or from breach of contract
[0:09:31] <leith_aziz> Maybe she just had enough
[0:09:39] <+arcforged> Indie is hype
[0:09:47] <%X2Eliah> yuck
[0:09:51] <%servicesuspension> didn't she get a full year of china harassment? I get it. Also, she made millions
[0:09:52] <%X2Eliah> yuuuuck
[0:09:54] <ulcaban> Woolie salty cause he couldn't stick the landing as vtuber
[0:09:57] <%Juriasu> huhhhh
[0:09:59] <%derap41> Discovery
[0:10:00] <a_bald_bro> that's not very disco
[0:10:03] <%OblivionSword1> interesting
[0:10:03] <%derap41> Discovering
[0:10:08] <+drakthebest> Or learning from hell
[0:10:13] <miucsa51> awesome
[0:10:15] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> You can't translate inferno as suffering
[0:10:17] <%servicesuspension> Disco Elysium. Elysium means heaven so...
[0:10:19] <Sonicdy> Disco vering
[0:10:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> because disco music is different
[0:10:20] <asdief_> Disc
[0:10:21] <%OblivionSword1> good question actually
[0:10:32] <%servicesuspension> Disco from disc?
[0:10:34] <leith_aziz> Music can be interpreted as discovery in some way
[0:10:37] <%servicesuspension> I'm confused
[0:10:40] <SelfAwareCanOpener> I’m excited for this
[0:10:41] <+jayayanami> japane2NANI
[0:10:42] <Prevot> anything to do with discs?
[0:10:44] <miucsa51> Discovery
[0:10:46] <%X2Eliah> good question
[0:10:47] <mr_sups> French: Record Library
[0:10:48] <+Funkyfjord> yo reggie lookin nice
[0:10:49] <miucsa51> by daft punk
[0:10:57] <%X2Eliah> oh
[0:10:57] <leith_aziz> Also aswedish
[0:10:58] <Sonicdy> Disco Tech
[0:11:00] <Chatterbox1991> if they make a sequal it should be Disco Purgatory and Disco Inferno
[0:11:02] <leith_aziz> Bibliotek
[0:11:04] <%servicesuspension> gun is short from handgun
[0:11:22] <SelfAwareCanOpener> Cuz disco samples
[0:11:25] <%Double_Tap_That> Double_Tap_That subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Not sure if it's been asked, but what do you think is your highest Disco Elysium stat is? Also, does this match your perceived stat for each other?
[0:11:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> It apparently was used to describe a type of nightclub in France in the 40s
[0:11:32] <%servicesuspension> biblioteca is spanish for library still
[0:11:34] <%kyh9> I guess because you hear more experimental music in the music library
[0:11:37] <%hax_metatron> Vince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre. He wrote the feature article "Discotheque Rock Paaaaarty" that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in September 1973.
[0:11:40] <mr_sups> Also Discus
[0:11:43] <Sonicdy> Disco sample music?
[0:11:46] <Pt_Kamen> DISCO =/= DISCUS
[0:11:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> The Wikipedia article has good info on it @WoolieVersus
[0:11:48] <Junkles> because that's how big the genre is man, it's like a library. that's why we called it disco man
[0:11:52] <pi_in_the_sci> It became the genre name in the exact same way "Club Music" is a genre
[0:12:04] <%derap41> disco, from discotheque, is a blend of disque + bibliothèque, disque in that case being a record, as in music, as in a library of music. it is thought that your latin 'disco', the verb, is unrelated to the object.
[0:12:08] <%hax_metatron> "DUBSTEP"
[0:12:11] <%X2Eliah> disco -> ??? -> discotheque -> disco music
[0:12:11] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[0:12:28] <aiutare47> Isn’t it just “disc+library”
[0:12:28] <%Juriasu> Encyclopedia is getting us even outside the game
[0:12:54] <%servicesuspension> Disco Elysium: Learning Heaven?
[0:13:08] <leith_aziz> Made in Heaven
[0:13:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:13:18] <%derap41> discotheque and Discovery have separate origins
[0:13:19] <%Juriasu> CoolStoryBob
[0:13:21] <%derpy_platypus> D in Disco stands for strand
[0:13:38] <%livlinn> woolieSPICE
[0:13:50] <%servicesuspension> so dico is danced in the disco
[0:13:50] <mr_sups> Think of Discoteque as "The Club"
[0:13:52] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Woolie look up origin of word discoitheque
[0:13:52] <%servicesuspension> disco*
[0:14:01] <%hax_metatron> JAZZ WOOLIE
[0:14:08] <%hax_metatron> JAZZ MEANT ENERGY and energetic things
[0:14:15] <Pt_Kamen> DISCUS are not DISCUS
[0:14:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's always been Jazz
[0:14:16] <SelfAwareCanOpener> It’s a song built from a library
[0:14:16] <%derap41> Mixing Greek and latins here
[0:14:25] <Pt_Kamen> DISCO vs DISCUS
[0:14:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> No
[0:14:34] <mr_sups> Club and Club music
[0:14:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> It was literally jazz clubs woolie
[0:14:47] <%Juriasu> language is fucked up
[0:14:54] <%OblivionSword1> language is weird
[0:14:57] <Prevot> language is HARD CORE
[0:15:09] <%OblivionSword1> INTERNALLY COHERENT
[0:15:10] <%X2Eliah> language is root tongue
[0:15:13] <%servicesuspension> is it tho
[0:15:14] <jesuchanplays> NO WOOLIE JAZZ WAS A RACIST TERM
[0:15:16] <leith_aziz> What game?
[0:15:20] <%derap41> Measurehead would have a field day with entomology origins of Disco
[0:15:24] <%prime_name> Woolie wants to hurt good
[0:15:28] <%Vigonept> whatch it just be utter shit
[0:15:32] <%Juriasu> 50hz world?
[0:15:34] <%hax_metatron> Isn't Dadaism similar? But never really took off and I think we dodged "Dada music" in favor of "Disco"
[0:15:36] <%X2Eliah> what
[0:15:37] <leith_aziz> The one of the more Mature Pokemon, right?
[0:15:38] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:15:44] <linSP> What if pokemon went too far
[0:15:47] <Prevot> the game PETA thinks pokemon is
[0:15:51] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[0:16:03] <%servicesuspension> Palworld has only one, very stupid joke. But GOD it's HILARIOUS
[0:16:05] <%eanscrale> Every Pal a member of the board!
[0:16:13] <%X2Eliah> @hax_metatron I thought dadaism was deliberate name chosen to represent meaninglessness of dadaist art
[0:16:14] <%OblivionSword1> knowing that studio it's not gonna go anywhere where we ant to be
[0:16:16] <leith_aziz> I think Black and White tried doing that, but it was pretty mild
[0:16:38] <%servicesuspension> The game ends with pals unionizing and fucking you up
[0:16:45] <linSP> “It’s only a crime if you get caught” says the deva
[0:16:47] <%Juriasu> AAAIGH
[0:16:48] <leith_aziz> I'm not really a Pokemon fan, so I cant speak on that
[0:16:48] <linSP> Devs*
[0:16:50] <mr_sups> INTERNALLY COHERENT
[0:16:52] <Prevot> if anything Black and White was gun control analogy
[0:16:54] <Miklosher> Yaagh
[0:16:56] <a_bald_bro> INCREMENTAL PROGRESS! YEAGH!
[0:17:00] <Eger007> but is it thought?
[0:17:03] <cheapdoc> Oh, we haven't started ... HARDCORE
[0:17:09] <Indigo_Automaton> SKIBIDEE SKIBIDANGER
[0:17:27] <gernal_20> I AM THE REARANGER
[0:17:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> I feel like everyone would have some of their own stats too
[0:17:32] <%derap41> Copy out the stat board and stat each other
[0:17:48] <%Vigonept> woolie big drama or rhetoric
[0:17:49] <%derap41> Oh I suck
[0:17:54] <%prime_name> I never thought highly of myself in elementary school
[0:18:01] <a_bald_bro> MAX ELECTROCHEMISTRY
[0:18:05] <%X2Eliah> Woolie must be rhetoric, he uses it all the time
[0:18:08] <leith_aziz> I considered getting Titanfall 2 on Steam. Aside from not wanting to use Origin, is the hacker problem still prevelant?
[0:18:28] <%Juriasu> @leith_aziz itäs worth it for the singleplayer anyway
[0:18:31] <die_hardman> The stats are , in a real life application, probably just posh pseudo-science. But their cool to look at :)
[0:18:33] <@Solidus_113> the "highest" could be a 4
[0:18:35] <%derap41> Just because someone else is better doesn't mean you can't be good
[0:18:37] <%Vigonept> i never had a good image of myself so im free from that
[0:18:39] <user_naim> Yeah, math got hard in uni, and suddenly i had to learn how to learn for the first time
[0:18:44] <leith_aziz> I try to excel at every subject in School. But I think it's weighing down on me in terms of stress
[0:18:49] <%derap41> Got that Rhetoric down
[0:18:57] <leith_aziz> If I dont get an A (highest grade in EU), I get depressed
[0:19:06] <%servicesuspension> all stats are dumb, put it all on Inland Empire
[0:19:08] <leith_aziz> No matter the subject
[0:19:09] <mr_sups> Real question, what's your lowest
[0:19:19] <Prevot> empathy IS a super power after all LUL
[0:19:23] <AnneSQF> I feel like Woolie is pretty strong on the entire blue row
[0:19:27] <%X2Eliah> @leith_aziz You got to start filtering the ones that matter from the ones that dont
[0:19:32] <+harmadill0> LUL
[0:19:33] <die_hardman> @mr_sups hand eye coordination
[0:19:37] <%livlinn> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[0:19:40] <mr_sups> Volition
[0:19:40] <%eanscrale> Its the only stat that never goes down
[0:19:43] <%X2Eliah> fair
[0:19:48] <a_bald_bro> that fighting game reaction speed
[0:19:52] <%X2Eliah> Woolie does tjne button bashers good
[0:19:53] <+harmadill0> Go all in on Shivers and just stand there silently taking in the city all day
[0:20:05] <aiutare47> Reaction speed is also mental
[0:20:07] <user_naim> Authority might be down there for me
[0:20:10] <mr_sups> Interfacing and Hand Eye?
[0:20:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:14] <+ItsRatman> Surely Woolie has good Hand Eye Coordination?
[0:20:17] <Chatterbox1991> Having high rhetoric and high drama but low logic is the fucking worst (i say this from experience) @WoolieVersus
[0:20:22] <leith_aziz> My Fighting Game skills are something I'm 50/50 on if they'll help later on
[0:20:28] <%prime_name> rhetoric is a dump stat anyway
[0:20:38] <%heysamuel> i have an actual degree in theatre and i'm pretty sure my drama skill is near 0
[0:20:41] <%derap41> Woolie you camera is blinking again fyi
[0:20:44] <%servicesuspension> what stat do you wish to have? I wish I had EDC. Mamoru some Nakamas
[0:21:00] <%derap41> you're good at making yourself understood

[0:21:01] <leith_aziz> Elaborating on your perspective
[0:21:06] <%Vigonept> woolies trying to get his truth cult going avain
[0:21:06] <leith_aziz> That what you mean
[0:21:07] <%X2Eliah> @derap41 eh its been doing that ever since he upgraded
[0:21:23] <+harmadill0> MAXXED OUT PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT don't forget
[0:21:24] <%derap41> @derap41 good upgrade there
[0:21:56] <leith_aziz> Relatable sounds like
[0:21:57] <%derap41> @harmadill0 Endurance is shot though
[0:21:59] <glorioushedonist> Woolie how's your esprit de cops?
[0:21:59] <%servicesuspension> how's ya SHIVERS? son!? Can you hear the voice of Quebec?
[0:22:01] <snuffkins> Low volition high composure?
[0:22:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> very relatable
[0:22:13] <%Vigonept> low authority
[0:22:15] <@Solidus_113> Reggie works on the Indigo Prophecy feeling meter
[0:22:15] <%X2Eliah> LUL quebec shivers
[0:22:18] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> How often do you stand in the street and vibe with the city? Every day?
[0:22:28] <%derap41> Shrinks should use this table
[0:22:32] <%mariothemaio> I feel that, I've been feeling way more sensitive in the last few months :(
[0:22:33] <leith_aziz> I just feel like crap when I eff up, especially when someone else gets affected as a result of my mistakes
[0:22:38] <%servicesuspension> Canada shivers talk to you in construction noises
[0:22:40] <%JustYudha> we doing self introspection rn
[0:22:49] <leith_aziz> When I do bad at studies, I just feel bad for my family
[0:23:02] <%servicesuspension> You could use the Character Sheet for therapy, like legit
[0:23:05] <aiutare47> Does a voice whisper down your spine? Can you feel the spirit of the FGC?
[0:23:06] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:23:31] <%X2Eliah> @leith_aziz what level are you at,btw? highschool? uni?
[0:23:39] <%DkLordG> that they were gonna roll me
[0:23:42] <%eanscrale> It turns out Car Batteries are really bad for aquatic life
[0:23:43] <emeraldskrull> i have that feeling a lot but it's almost always false facts I heard from Joe Rogan or Pat.
[0:23:52] <%X2Eliah> @leith_aziz because at some point, grades utterly stop mattering being passing
[0:23:58] <%derap41> Mega moralists perspective
[0:24:03] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz They're called different things in EU, but I think you guys call it Highschool.
[0:24:03] <%servicesuspension> woolieONEGUY tells you it's wrong
[0:24:03] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I've been conditioned to qualify so many things and avoid making concrete statements for fear of getting stuff wrong now LUL
[0:24:03] <%prime_name> Life is just realizing all the stuff you were taught in High School was a lie.
[0:24:04] <%bread_assassin> Hmmmm
[0:24:12] <%derap41> source?
[0:24:13] <%Lion_kun> Like talking about Vtubers Woolie?
[0:24:17] <%livlinn> psaWrong
[0:24:17] <%kewlmyc> We do give you too hard of a time at points. Sorry Woolz.
[0:24:20] <Sonicdy> Stat -1
[0:24:27] <vasily_kardanov> @Lion_kun LUL
[0:25:00] <Prevot> woolie with the random bird knowledge out of nowhere
[0:25:00] <LlewynMarie> such cool little birds
[0:25:15] <aiutare47> Peregrine is fastest animal earth.
[0:25:16] <Junkles> My understanding is the Saker falcon flies faster than Peregrine
[0:25:18] <%derap41> Everything you know is wrong
[0:25:20] <%JustYudha> LUL
[0:25:26] <%derap41> up is down now sing along
[0:25:27] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Alternative Facts
[0:25:28] <%servicesuspension> But what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
[0:25:32] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Fake facts are facts
[0:25:36] <%Vigonept> just dont be completly sure of yourself
[0:25:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait i missed the last 10 min what i miss
[0:25:39] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus If you were to consider Esprite de Corps your FGC Shivers, how high is it?
[0:25:46] <%servicesuspension> turns out facts really don't care about our feelings :(
[0:25:55] <%Juriasu> it doesn't help that things you learned years ago has been proven to either be false or only partly correct
[0:26:02] <Sonicdy> Every Trivia is not false but not right :)
[0:26:03] <%Juriasu> because science learns new things
[0:26:04] <@Solidus_113> man very wrong but also very loud so who knows
[0:26:05] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @servicesuspension european or african swallow?
[0:26:09] <leith_aziz> @cobalt_phoenix_ They were discussing the current events with a V-tuber. Presumabely Coco?
[0:26:13] <%JustYudha> That's why I appreciate Pat not giving a fuck lmfao
[0:26:17] <%Vigonept> books aint shit
[0:26:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ oh still okthanks
[0:26:24] <Eger007> it IS decent, you've been lied to
[0:26:25] <%JustYudha> Like the whole Rats can't swim shit is great
[0:26:26] <leith_aziz> Also the true meaning of "Disco"
[0:26:28] <%servicesuspension> @Reverend_Roscoe I dunno *gets yeeted*
[0:26:39] <%derap41> Just hook my brain into the Wikipedia already
[0:26:45] <leith_aziz> I get scared of Hights
[0:26:52] <%prime_name> Shivers is magic
[0:27:00] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no youd be high as shit out in the world
[0:27:07] <Prevot> if you have shivers get medical help, that's schizophrenia
[0:27:08] <%derap41> Shivers is just an internal narrative
[0:27:09] <%servicesuspension> Quebec Shivers, construction noises tell you important clues about the case
[0:27:15] <%X2Eliah> If you have high shivers, yoyu are out there fucking the pavement every night
[0:27:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[0:27:21] <he1lhydra> shivers could be someone who plays fighting games entirely by feel
[0:27:22] <SelfAwareCanOpener> Unless you’re hiding from your shivers
[0:27:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah crusty boiiiis
[0:27:35] <%mariothemaio> Shivers is "you know your way around intuitively"
[0:27:38] <Chatterbox1991> again, FGC Esprite de Corps
[0:27:39] <aiutare47> FGC EDC though.
[0:27:41] <ariszed> i feel like taxi drivers would have shivers
[0:27:45] <%servicesuspension> I'd like to wander the streets, but I don't want to get stabbed
[0:27:49] <%Jay_Watching> woolie has high conceptualization I think
[0:27:53] <LlewynMarie> it could be something like, a person who's lived in a certain city for a very long time and just knows the 'spirit' of the place.
[0:28:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Science keeps evolving
[0:28:09] <leith_aziz> If we mean shivers in general, for me its probably walking around at night
[0:28:11] <Sonicdy> Prob if one got shivers they record themselves on the road
[0:28:12] <%mariothemaio> it's understanding where you are with intense familiarity
[0:28:19] <Pt_Kamen> Bit is it though?
[0:28:21] <%Double_Tap_That> Glad you thought so.
[0:28:26] <LlewynMarie> like cab drivers
[0:28:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> where the hood where the hood where the hood at
[0:28:42] <leith_aziz> It sounds like what Shivers is, well it's something different from what I think it ios
[0:28:44] <+Stormiercashew> hardcore?
[0:28:45] <leith_aziz> *is
[0:28:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @pt_kamen internally coherent!
[0:28:48] <%servicesuspension> Welcome To Revachol :)
[0:29:12] <%X2Eliah> YEKOKATAA
[0:29:16] <glorioushedonist> look at all those empty INT points
[0:29:17] <%servicesuspension> The ADM was annoying but I'm honestly getting into it for real
[0:29:19] <wibbwobbler> Low perception for sure
[0:29:27] <Inqy833> Let's get some INCREMENTAL CHANGE on!!
[0:29:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> I don't understand how you two keep track of things you want to do in Disco while playing this game a week or so apart. It's hella impressive.
[0:29:31] <Equirah> damn, missed the pre-stream
[0:29:46] <+Mattismen> when you let him
[0:29:48] <vasily_kardanov> Kim doesn't leave until you let him
[0:29:48] <Johannen> 21 Hours and onwards
[0:29:48] <%mariothemaio> he doesn't leave until you send him off
[0:29:49] <+Bobbledygook> @wibbwobbler Perception 67% -1 streaming
[0:29:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> YEKOKATAA
[0:29:50] <%Juriasu> I'd go to the body and let Kim take it honestly
[0:29:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> until you decide
[0:29:52] <%servicesuspension> he leaves when you get to the whirling
[0:29:53] <superchunk121> Whenever you go to bed
[0:29:53] <%OblivionSword1> kim leave when you decided to
[0:29:55] <%X2Eliah> Kim leaves at when you go to sleep
[0:29:58] <%TheotherKristian> Woolie no
[0:29:58] <%bread_assassin> Kim leaves when you tell him, too.
[0:29:58] <Sonicdy> Welcome to Revachol where Disco Elysium happens
[0:30:02] <Blank9> he leaves when you go to the whirling and talk to him to say go away
[0:30:03] <Pt_Kamen> time freezes at 2:00am
[0:30:04] <aiutare47> Don’t forget to read the case files
[0:30:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> Kim leaves when you go to the shack/bedroom
[0:30:06] <+Vivaciousx3> you have to go to your house/send him off
[0:30:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> is the body still there??
[0:30:10] <%X2Eliah> Whirling OR shack
[0:30:10] <+airchrysalis> go to your new room
[0:30:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[0:30:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> He will
[0:30:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he will
[0:30:14] <%OblivionSword1> he will
[0:30:14] <+Vivaciousx3> he does
[0:30:15] <Indigo_Automaton> he will
[0:30:15] <Pt_Kamen> he stays with you until you sleep
[0:30:15] <%X2Eliah> he will
[0:30:17] <%kewlmyc> Yeah he will
[0:30:17] <%X2Eliah> no
[0:30:18] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yes he will, you have to send him off
[0:30:21] <%Vigonept> he will unless you get rid of him
[0:30:21] <vasily_kardanov> You can send the body off at 2AM
[0:30:21] <primaryfire> he will only leave when you dismiss him
[0:30:24] <Fuji808> He stays with you till you send him off
[0:30:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> As long as you don't go to the shack/bedroom, he will stay
[0:30:28] <+drakthebest> He will never leave you
[0:30:34] <Inqy833> He leaves when you go to your room/cabin
[0:30:40] <%X2Eliah> ye finish off
[0:30:41] <Pt_Kamen> time is only important for certain NPCs
[0:30:46] <+Vivaciousx3> good idea, plenty of time for the church
[0:30:47] <%servicesuspension> talk to acele, she's got some new dialogue
[0:30:50] <%Juriasu> Yeah, I'd finish day adn then come back here with some healing
[0:30:55] <superchunk121> He only leaves when you go to the cabin or whirling
[0:31:04] <+Bitscreed> You can also send him to take the body to the morgue and he'll back in the morning.
[0:31:16] <+Vivaciousx3> you might be able to quick travel to the whirling
[0:31:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Busy busy
[0:31:25] <+AWKWARDL0SER> The corpse
[0:31:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stand in front of church to use fast travel
[0:31:35] <Indigo_Automaton> Send him to take the body
[0:31:45] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Have Kim leave to take back the hunged man
[0:31:45] <%servicesuspension> doing a walk is better than fast travel because he might find more stuff
[0:31:48] <Trace_Bovier> kerioke
[0:31:53] <%bread_assassin> Karaoke?
[0:31:56] <Pt_Kamen> do the church
[0:31:57] <Indigo_Automaton> Good plan
[0:32:05] <%derap41> getting drugs
[0:32:11] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stand in front of church to use the fast travel system
[0:32:12] <%X2Eliah> may be too late for karbakoke
[0:32:15] <%alpharius88> Cunno drugs
[0:32:24] <+harmadill0> Once you dismiss Kim you get access to the "dark events"

[1:00:49] <dextralmalin> oh shoot, they don't have *those* gloves
[1:00:50] <Inqy833> Might as well roll then boost if you fail.
[1:00:53] <%servicesuspension> maybe Siileng sells some drip for interfacing
[1:00:54] <%X2Eliah> Oh, you can buy faln shoes from siileng!!!!
[1:01:00] <%X2Eliah> you have the dosh

[1:01:17] <%derap41> you always level before rolling don't do that
[1:01:23] <notadeasterisk> yes
[1:01:24] <%DiscoMatador> you can buy the faln shoes from sileng now

[1:11:28] <a_bald_bro> jesus woolie lol
[1:11:31] <+mechslayer71> @x2eliah I know that. but I keep saying it in hopes they see it and are reminded because they haven't mentioned him in multiple sessions and I'm not entirely convinced they haven't forgotten about him

[1:11:52] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Report the boardwalk body to the station doesn't remove kim
[1:11:53] <aiutare47> Read the case files when youre done for the night by the way
[1:12:01] <%meniscate> lol woolie confirmed not paying attention
[1:12:03] <%hax_metatron> Woolie remember again that if you start conversations this late, and save in the middle, reloading at a later time could make the NPCs disappear!!! This has happened before and pissed you off.
[1:12:06] <iacus_> better to get rid of Kim at night, otherwise you spend a whole day without him
[1:12:08] <%X2Eliah> woolie doesnt listen
[1:12:28] <%servicesuspension> what does the gauge do
[1:12:28] <Johannen> Does Woolie want to send Kim away during the day?
[1:12:35] <+MrAtheGreat> oooo Boy woolie is cutting it close here

[1:16:54] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> That was just to convince him, you get to choose when to do it

[1:19:17] <pi_in_the_sci> Kim will only depart if you go into a place you can sleep, that means the shack right now
[1:19:18] <%heysamuel> still worth to do the cuno bits
[1:19:22] <akajaybay> will Kim go driving with the body in the middle of the night?
[1:19:25] <%X2Eliah> yeeeee pile
[1:19:31] <%hax_metatron> Tomorrow morning
[1:19:33] <RENTARIM> You can go to the church.

[1:19:52] <jorniev> HE just left it outside!?
[1:19:55] <%heysamuel> it's fully okay if kim's there for the klassje convo i think
[1:19:56] <die_hardman> the body never decomposes
[1:19:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Pick him up with a mop and aand bucket
[1:19:59] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus she stays until 23:00
[1:20:01] <KaitlynnHere> @jorniev yes, and?

[1:20:25] <%derap41> We need a hose for this
[1:20:30] <+Bitscreed> By now they could probably just pour the body into the bag

[1:36:03] <%meniscate> It's the old lady at the truck
[1:36:04] <Chatterbox1991> Old Lady Truck Driver by the King Statue
[1:36:09] <alexandrecau> she is by the jam you kept avoiding her since day one
[1:36:15] <Indigo_Automaton> Did he not already meet her?
[1:36:16] <alexandrecau> near the statue
[1:36:17] <+airchrysalis> date time?
[1:36:19] <penitentpendant> He ever talk to Dispatch about the armor numbers?
[1:36:21] <iacus_> you met the piledriver briefly. need to explore the trucks
[1:36:21] <Ecall10528> She is in the traffic jam.
[1:36:25] <die_hardman> Pale lady near statue
[1:36:28] <jorniev> the old lady near the statue
[1:36:39] <penitentpendant> It's still in his task lists

[1:36:46] <Miklosher> you did though
[1:36:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you did talk to them
[1:36:49] <%meniscate> You *have* spoken to her
[1:36:50] <dauver> NotLikeThis
[1:36:51] <%Juriasu> everything is this game is better with Kim
[1:36:52] <alexandrecau> yiou spoke to her you kust ignored it
[1:36:53] <Johannen> You have spoken to her
[1:36:55] <%servicesuspension> you did spoke to her, kim told you "later"
[1:36:55] <+mechslayer71> you still need to talk to evrart tomorrow
[1:36:59] <%hax_metatron> You have to be at the spots
[1:37:01] <Indigo_Automaton> Okay yeah they did meet her then
[1:37:03] <%meniscate> woolie no remember
[1:37:03] <+Bitscreed> The fast travel is fiddly
[1:37:03] <+physicslawyer> You have to be on one of the spots for quick travel.
[1:37:05] <%chandlerofearth> old homeless lady who was asleep
[1:37:05] <%Juriasu> quick travel is only from places you can travel too
[1:37:06] <user_naim> You have, you just super forgot
[1:37:06] <+MrAtheGreat> need to be in plaza
[1:37:09] <%purps26> I never figured out how to get fast travel to work
[1:37:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stand in city plaza
[1:37:10] <%hax_metatron> You have to be at the spots where fast travel is available
[1:37:11] <penitentpendant> Quick travel is buggy in this game. You have to be standing in a quicktravel point to travel to other quicktravel points.
[1:37:11] <akajaybay> It's all Cuno goblins in here
[1:37:12] <%X2Eliah> Quick travel doesnt work
[1:37:13] <%hax_metatron> Near the car
[1:37:14] <die_hardman> You did talk to her @woolieversus
[1:37:14] <+williss_> quick travel is dumb and only works in certain spots on the map
[1:37:16] <%SomeAsianDood> it doesn't
[1:37:20] <Chatterbox1991> Is Cindy the Skull awake at this hour? you have a quest regarding the Armor Pieces that relate to her
[1:37:22] <+Vigonept> its probably bugged for you
[1:37:22] <penitentpendant> It doesn't always work though
[1:37:28] <OblivionSword1> Woolie you have talk to the pale driver you forgot
[1:37:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stand in the city plaza, by door to Whirling
[1:37:33] <+AWKWARDL0SER> It kinda doesn’t
[1:37:37] <iacus_> was fast travel in the regular edition of the game?
[1:37:42] <penitentpendant> Unfortunately, quicktravel often bugs after day 3
[1:37:46] <dauver> oof
[1:37:49] <+Vigonept> remember to talk to cindy again
[1:37:51] <+dalmek> fast travel was added in the final cut @iacus_
[1:38:00] <LlewynMarie> just leave him be he'll figure it out
[1:38:03] <%Juriasu> there is a thing that disables quick travel otherwise it should always work
[1:38:05] <%meniscate> woolie.

[1:38:33] <+MrAtheGreat> you've done all you can without kim
[1:38:34] <%X2Eliah> hes been ignoring for abloody month, ofc ppl are jumpy
[1:38:36] <elshadow7> Don't you need kim for that?
[1:38:36] <%hax_metatron> No drivers now ... sleepy time
[1:38:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait for kim for that
[1:38:59] <+DenpaDev> kim said to leave them alone i think?
[1:39:07] <user_naim> @gelphaze does it have a release date?
[1:39:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the only kim-less things are klassje, lilienne, and paledriver
[1:39:19] <elshadow7> Oof, that's low
[1:39:20] <user_naim> Because the movement mechanics seemed hype
[1:39:21] <%derap41> Weak

[1:39:53] <Johannen> You already aproached the Lade Pale Driver but Kim "advised" you to not do that at that time
[1:39:55] <jorniev> you can fuck this one up safely
[1:40:02] <%hax_metatron> God I hope he doesn't succeed on the date at night ... it's extremely unintentionally hilarious if that happens NotLikeThis

[2:06:04] <%thetunnelhomer> @candidateplays See?
[2:06:07] <iacus_> seems like the ultralibs to talks about "human nature"
[2:06:09] <+Bitscreed> Couch! Couch! Couch!
[2:06:12] <candidateplays> huh
[2:06:18] <Eger007> amost 2 AM
[2:06:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:06:20] <Picia000123> these POCKETS
[2:06:28] <%fauxmachine> number go up
[2:06:29] <+Jeshk0> "human nature" is "greed is good" for ultralibs
[2:06:30] <%Gruhunchously> FUCK CAPITALISM, GET PAID
[2:06:32] <heemwizard> i guess 1 would be communist option
[2:06:33] <+Sabbington> gotta get that dopamine hit
[2:06:36] <user_naim> ”The money-cash answer”
[2:06:37] <%servicesuspension> say right thing, get a dollar. woolie's ready for his career as a debate bro
[2:06:39] <%heysamuel> oh fuck this case
[2:06:44] <stormhawk9891> Oh this one...
[2:06:45] <Picia000123> oh, this case is fucked
[2:06:46] <DSD24> Everytime Pockets killed someone in that KOTOR LP that noise happened
[2:06:50] <Ecall10528> This is a dark one.
[2:06:52] <user_naim> calm down guys
[2:06:52] <tequi1asunset> Oh this is a good one
[2:06:53] <lysolysols> You can check your journal before making a choice and then check it right after to see if the number changed— just if you’re curious.
[2:07:04] <iacus_> Well, arguments to "human nature" are commiting to a particular pgilosophy (the idea that such a thing as human nature exists, can be determined, and we have determined)
[2:07:12] <Chatterbox1991> CAPCOM
[2:07:21] <%purps26> because it's RIGHT
[2:07:22] <%derap41> Turns out Woolie is a social democrat
[2:07:22] <Picia000123> Harrier Du Bois truly one of a kind solving this one
[2:07:27] <%servicesuspension> white head, woolie, this is Revachol
[2:07:29] <%purps26> Woolie hates the poor!
[2:07:30] <Burningfajitas> CapCom: regularly kill the 1%
[2:07:30] <heemwizard> too bad woolie doesnt have the stats to do the ultraliberal political quest
[2:07:35] <%Gruhunchously> Bridge to Terabithia reference
[2:07:42] <OblivionSword1> it's an antler ans star in disco
[2:07:45] <%thetunnelhomer> Oh hey, a planescape reference
[2:07:51] <Picia000123> @heemwizard he super does
[2:07:51] <+Bitscreed> Nice Planescape reference there.
[2:07:54] <Burningfajitas> Finna get the star and antlers tattooed on me
[2:07:56] <aiutare47> I forget, does this case file unlock a white check to figure out what happened to the ledger, or does it just say?
[2:08:02] <gunsrlove> The shine of not having electricity and water past 7 p.m. you mean Kappa Kappa
[2:08:09] <lysolysols> You can do any political quest as long as you have the thought related to it — you don’t even need to internalize the thought.
[2:08:11] <heemwizard> @Picia000123 no he doesnt, his savoir faire is like 2 lmao
[2:08:16] <candidateplays> @aiutare47 you get a bonus to the interface check, but that's it
[2:08:25] <aiutare47> oh ok
[2:08:28] <Picia000123> @heemwizard it don't matter
[2:08:33] <%servicesuspension> @Burningfajitas you can buy official merch woolieMIRIN
[2:08:49] <tequi1asunset> Then roll it Coward
[2:08:53] <servicesuspension> @Burningfajitas not joking btw
[2:09:14] <jorniev> this one takes a wild turn
[2:09:16] <%derap41> Local crazies
[2:09:19] <user_naim> we don’t need to give previews
[2:09:29] <Burningfajitas> @servicesuspension oh I know, i've been eyeing the tie
[2:09:30] <+Bitscreed> @servicesuspension I own the star and antlers t-shirt
[2:09:46] <lysolysols> (That said, the ultraliberal quest isn’t as interesting as the moralist one — like I recommend doing that one first bc of bonus lore.)
[2:09:52] <alexandrecau> Wait so everyone else is fair game to see your junk?
[2:09:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> Zemlyaki = Yakuza?
[2:10:07] <heemwizard> yeah the moralist one should be done first
[2:10:07] <+Jeshk0> fake russian mob is my guess
[2:10:08] <%derap41> yeah scoop that shit out
[2:10:14] <heemwizard> because the setup is longest
[2:10:20] <guiltyboya> It means "terrians" in russian
[2:10:25] <%X2Eliah> @zanzibarian_hamster less prestigious and more local
[2:10:27] <gunsrlove> "landians"
[2:10:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> Fair enough, just assumed because of the Yaki
[2:11:02] <jorniev> its a weird turn
[2:11:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit

[2:25:52] <yficaptions> "hating on people" the game

[2:26:38] <dewwy125> watermelon does sound tasty though
[2:26:38] <gunsrlove> I'll take shisha over the plastic vape cocks and vape sticks any day

[2:29:27] <+Sir_Louis> it's more like you just try it over and over
[2:29:32] <%derap41> you just gotta build up bonuses
[2:29:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> No, you just have to actually level Electrochem instead of not at all
[2:29:34] <Blank9> lotta clothes boost it
[2:29:34] <Picia000123> check your mail for Evrart maybe?
[2:29:35] <%fauxmachine> well, it does say "impossible"
[2:29:38] <die_hardman> Put on your clothes
[2:29:39] <OblivionSword1> you can absolutely do it
[2:29:42] <lysolysols> You have a lot of electrochem clothes.
[2:29:59] <%kewlmyc> You can get lucky. I did during my playthrough. I missed the expression.
[2:30:04] <die_hardman> No
[2:30:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> or you could unlock a bonus at some point that would reset it
[2:30:08] <+DenpaDev> electrochem is hormones too
[2:30:13] <lysolysols> Good point.

[2:31:57] <+mechslayer71> limbic system is the one voice in this game I'm not a huge fan of, it's trying too hard
[2:31:58] <lysolysols> I’m glad he’s not the narrator tho bc it would be too intense.
[2:32:00] <KaitlynnHere> Oh

[2:32:21] <+Vigonept> C o m m u n i s m

[2:52:07] <%Gruhunchously> Say what?
[2:52:07] <alexandrecau> flobertz
[2:52:07] <%SirGO0SE> flowbears?
[2:52:09] <dukenux> flobear?
[2:52:09] <Johannen> flowbears
[2:52:09] <%heysamuel> flaubert is the in-universe slur
[2:52:09] <Miklosher> Flaubert
[2:52:11] <Blackleafx> flaubert
[2:52:12] <primaryfire> flauberts
[2:52:14] <+Bitscreed> Oh wow they didn't censor Flauberts
[2:52:16] <+physicslawyer> Forgot to censor.
[2:52:19] <+green715> Forgot to bleep I think
[2:52:22] <Zomner> it fucked up the bleep
[2:52:23] <seriousink> yeah they forget to bleep a few times
[2:52:23] <+dalmek> I think they just forgot to bleep that one
[2:52:26] <primaryfire> I'm pretty sure that was unintentional
[2:52:26] <lysolysols> Someone removed the filter from the word and apparently some voice actors were saying “Flaubert” for f******.
[2:52:27] <dewwy125> you internalised homosecual underground so it stops censoring
[2:52:28] <%heysamuel> yeah this one was a forgotten beep
[2:52:30] <%DiscoMatador> Forgot I think
[2:52:35] <Picia000123> they forgot to bleep
[2:52:36] <aiutare47> That’s the one in the game they forgot to censor
[2:52:37] <Blackleafx> @WoolieVersus I believe internalizing Homosexual Underground removes the beep
[2:52:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> Oh, doesn't Homosexual underground unbleep it?
[2:52:39] <%derap41> Actors didn't want to say the word
[2:52:40] <primaryfire> they forget to bleep them sometimes
[2:52:40] <OblivionSword1> they forgot this one
[2:52:41] <+ItsRatman> you have homosexual underground, f*** is no longer censored
[2:52:42] <dukenux> Flaubert is this world's version of f*****
[2:52:42] <Blackleafx> its a secret effect
[2:52:43] <user_naim> I think they forgot
[2:52:44] <+airchrysalis> they told the voice actor to say any f word and theyll beep it, they didnt sensor it
[2:52:45] <%thetunnelhomer> It's the homosexual underground thought
[2:52:45] <SamHellbent> The beep messed up lol
[2:52:47] <dukenux> ?
[2:52:47] <Jetsfantasy> Character dependant?
[2:52:50] <crunchington001> Yeah, homosexual underground removes the bleeps
[2:52:51] <+Jeshk0> some bleeps were missed with updates
[2:52:52] <heemwizard> FLAUBERT
[2:52:57] <+DenpaDev> Your game mechanics did it
[2:52:58] <%Gruhunchously> The Homo-Sexual Underground
[2:52:58] <user_naim> @thetunnelhomer wait for real?
[2:52:59] <+Mickerus> It's almost like there's massive amounts of dialogue
[2:53:01] <AnneSQF> yea Gustave Flaubert
[2:53:02] <Blackleafx> Oh nvm
[2:53:02] <dewwy125> oh wait
[2:53:03] <Indigo_Automaton> Homosexual Underground removes the censor beeps
[2:53:04] <%servicesuspension> confusing
[2:53:04] <+ItsRatman> ... nevermind im wrong
[2:53:06] <Blackleafx> we psa1guy 'd it
[2:53:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> huh?
[2:53:09] <drunken_lemur> What is consistency?
[2:53:09] <%SomeAsianDood> hmmmm idk
[2:53:09] <Blackleafx> sorry
[2:53:10] <seriousink> there is also straight up a missed f-slur when talking to these guys at one point
[2:53:11] <+AWKWARDL0SER> The censorship is regisbo
[2:53:12] <heemwizard> its still a glitch
[2:53:12] <+Jeshk0> there ARE no rules!
[2:53:13] <alexandrecau> Woolie stopped figuring out
[2:53:13] <KaitlynnHere> I assumed cuno was saying the gay slur
[2:53:14] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Regional
[2:53:16] <Zomner> Woolie Won't Figure It Out
[2:53:17] <lysolysols> I think the VAs didn’t wanna say the word
[2:53:18] <%heysamuel> homosexual underground doesn't remove anything. it was a forgotten censor
[2:53:21] <die_hardman> Lol
[2:53:24] <dukenux> mustve been a bug
[2:53:32] <%heysamuel> also yeah watch out there's an actual f bomb coming up
[2:53:37] <%derap41> These two a pretty adorable
[2:53:40] <%thedankestmeeme> its the word where someone likes their same sex the demeanign one
[2:53:41] <Fuji808> VA probably doesn't want to say the f word and they didn't cut it
[2:53:55] <Fuji808> also these two are total nerds
[2:53:56] <dukenux> and yeah i guess va just used it, instead of dropping f-word
[2:53:58] <aiutare47> That’s the missed one. If I remember there’s one missed bleep in the whole game and it’s in this convo.
[2:53:59] <%p4ntless> it's fuckin Bulk and Skull
[2:54:01] <akajaybay> I always found it sketchy that they went with made up racist terms but decide to run with actual homophobic slang though censored.
[2:54:01] <ulcaban> God, they're trying so hard, its adorable!
[2:54:03] <lysolysols> Yeah there’s a couple bugs with the word where they forgot to censor it.
[2:54:15] <KaitlynnHere> There’s more than one bad words that start with an f, and some are fairly offensive
[2:54:22] <+k9nov> Guest starring the Skulls Parasite Unit
[2:54:28] <+Undenizen> Fuck the World seems to have a south london accent
[2:54:28] <+Jeshk0> these guys are for real posers
[2:54:42] <dewwy125> fuck the world speaks mle
[2:54:46] <lysolysols> At least two of the writers were lgbt iirc?
[2:54:58] <%heysamuel> kim rocks in this convo
[2:55:04] <+Mickerus> that was sarcasm
[2:55:24] <user_naim> I guess made up countries get made up racist slurs. Lets then differentiate at least
[2:55:35] <alexandrecau> Yes he was shot
[2:55:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:55:45] <KaitlynnHere> I even want to spell it out but I’m 100% sure it’ll get censored
[2:55:46] <dukenux> Beavis and Butt'ead
[2:55:49] <akajaybay> yeah I doubt its out of malice, its just a weird choice of what to change and what to leave
[2:56:01] <%illusiveSaint> college freshman kids lol
[2:56:02] <+DekeZander> it is also exhausting
[2:56:04] <+twohitgood> time for some street epistemology!
[2:56:17] <dewwy125> london
[2:56:21] <Astrophizz> south london
[2:56:22] <+dalmek> episstemology more like
[2:56:23] <+mechslayer71> yeah it's clearly a black guy
[2:56:25] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, it's called London
[2:56:29] <crunchington001> south of the river
[2:56:30] <aiutare47> @akajaybay Kinda makes sense to me. Different races, so different slurs.
[2:56:37] <+DenpaDev> I'm pretty sure the underground perk changes future references of the word
[2:56:52] <heemwizard> well the body is not hanging anymore
[2:56:55] <+Undenizen> It's typically a north/south divide.

[3:44:48] <+mechslayer71> go talk to evrart and investigate the lorrymen when you get a chance maybe
[3:44:51] <lysolysols> Did they talk to Evrart already?
[3:45:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1407590785118257154?s=20
[3:45:05] <%TheFabledAble> @TheFabledAble I just wanna watch that part cause I loved it when I got it personally
[3:45:06] <KaiserMario> @krispen_wa Thank god I didn't miss it! Thanx
[3:45:07] <die_hardman> @lysolysols no
[3:45:10] <heemwizard> @lysolysols no
[3:45:10] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There's also the coast in the daytime
[3:45:20] <heemwizard> you cant open the thing
[3:45:22] <%eanscrale> Now is not the time.
[3:45:22] <heemwizard> yet
[3:45:27] <%hax_metatron> You can come back later for this
[3:45:31] <%krispen_wa> THE BEAR
[3:45:40] <heemwizard> not yet
[3:45:43] <%TheFabledAble> complete church first
[3:45:43] <Indigo_Automaton> Come back later
[3:45:46] <+mechslayer71> I'm not convinced they haven't literally forgotten about evrart. I haven't heard them mention him in multiple sessions
[3:45:55] <JetpackMcQuack> Or get super ripped
[3:46:03] <heemwizard> @mechslayer71 probably did forget lol
[3:46:15] <%servicesuspension> I can imagine that getting 12 in one of those checks must be the hypest
[3:46:16] <lysolysols> Did they tell him they opened the weasel door?
[3:46:17] <akajaybay> dont forget the map charts all the past checks
[3:46:22] <heemwizard> karaoke is red check
[3:46:24] <lysolysols> It’s kind of important
[3:46:29] <%meniscate> Drug trafficking has no red checkw
[3:46:30] <%krispen_wa> can you pass that check with double 6s?
[3:46:32] <+mechslayer71> they didnt
[3:46:34] <+Jeshk0> talk to cindy is prolly safe
[3:46:37] <Ecall10528> They entreily forgot about the drug trade and joye's mission, so its very possible. @mechslayer71
[3:46:42] <die_hardman> @heemwizard good :)
[3:46:57] <+twohitgood> I like the karaoke fail better than the success.
[3:46:58] <lysolysols> Evrart goes to sleep at night so you gotta talk to him during the day
[3:47:06] <Blackleafx> Mr Evrart is helping you find your gun
[3:47:09] <%krispen_wa> woolie still needs to talk to the pale driver too right?
[3:47:10] <Pt_Kamen> @krispen_wa no, even a double 6 fails
[3:47:15] <codymagpie> Mr Evrart is helping you find your gun
[3:47:19] <+Jeshk0> @twohitgood same. its the better version imho
[3:47:43] <%krispen_wa> @pt_kamen interesting. so that 3% is a lie in some situations
[3:48:29] <+Undenizen> Wasn't there something about a murder going on at some point?
[3:48:29] <+Jeshk0> i know theres one situation where the 3% is absolutely a lie
[3:48:40] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There was a use for it, and Woolie came SO CLOSE
[3:48:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Undenizen murder? nah man we gotta sing
[3:49:02] <Blackleafx> dont sell the cube
[3:49:05] <heemwizard> sell spirit, speaker and ball
[3:49:05] <+twohitgood> the game does like any good DM does; make things happen when the narrative works better than the odds.
[3:49:18] <+Jeshk0> good profit on those speakers~
[3:49:20] <lysolysols> When you picked up the pétanque ball when you first met the old guys, you could have thrown their ball into the sea. That’s what the shotput ball could replace but otherwise you can sell it.
[3:49:21] <+mechslayer71> @jeshk0 the door noor of the church I think
[3:49:24] <%meniscate> You can sell the spirits too
[3:49:26] <heemwizard> pawn it
[3:49:27] <Indigo_Automaton> NO
[3:49:27] <+mechslayer71> north*

[3:55:27] <Ecall10528> Banana oppression.
[3:55:27] <Blackleafx> Tea and Bananas have got to be the most frivelous ones
[3:55:28] <jorniev> SALT
[3:55:32] <%derap41> Work all night and a Drink a Rum
[3:55:33] <notadeasterisk> oranges where originally from china right?
[3:55:34] <+MightyDuckShoes> Most of the slaves on the islands was so you can put two lumps in your tea
[3:55:36] <elshadow7> "The statements made in Suzerainty are not of a political nature, only for flavor."
[3:55:37] <Pt_Kamen> BANANAS

[3:55:40] <+Jeshk0> The Spice must flow!
[3:55:40] <lysolysols> If you ignore the rules of the board game/don’t worry about the score, it’s interesting.
[3:55:41] <Blackleafx> @derap41 daylight come and me wan go home
[3:55:43] <%krispen_wa> Thank you Dole for murdering people over Bananas
[3:55:44] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus Opium
[3:55:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> get them hooked on opium while we're at it
[3:55:46] <+harmadill0> easy for you to say now that you have spice, try no salt for a few days
[3:55:48] <brunoberserk> O R I E N T
[3:55:51] <Chatterbox1991> there are countries in Indochina that still eat French Pastries as a local delicacy, Vietnam
[3:55:52] <jorniev> ITS called a SALARY because of SALT
[3:55:53] <+lemon_lore> banana
[3:55:53] <%eanscrale> It all started cause white boy couldn't cook good

[3:56:04] <%TheFabledAble> you dont WANT to be addicted to our drugs? THEN DIE
[3:56:08] <+pandapeeps> psaUp Gimme that exotic salt
[3:56:11] <Blackleafx> @jorniev tbh thats less colonialism and more ancient romans. salt was pretty vital to preserving food.
[3:56:12] <KaitlynnHere> I literally thought when Woolie said spice he was making a dune reference
[3:56:16] <Johannen> Commodity is a Commodity, if you can get paid you do anything for it. As a hustler you should know Woolie
[3:56:17] <+harmadill0> I want some scifi epic about humanity discovering a new type of alien spice and going to war for it
[3:56:17] <+Undenizen> you're doing this WHILE carrying the obnoxious boombox.
[3:56:26] <Blackleafx> @KaitlynnHere nah, literal spices. nutmeg and stuff
[3:56:31] <+Jeshk0> WHA??
[3:56:32] <+Undenizen> peaches are better.
[3:56:36] <+MightyDuckShoes> blasphemy
[3:56:39] <Blackleafx> the dutch committed like 3 genocides just for apricots
[3:56:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they're like worse peaches
[3:56:44] <Blackleafx> *nutmegs
[3:56:44] <%TheFabledAble> they taste a lot better when youre high as fuck on purple cocain probably
[3:56:44] <Chatterbox1991> they are just small peaches
[3:56:46] <heartlesshealer> apricots are a fruit, so they have that going for them
[3:56:46] <KaitlynnHere> I know, it’s just that dune has been on my mind @blackleafx
[3:56:47] <Blackleafx> woolie threw me off
[3:56:55] <Indigo_Automaton> Nectarines are where it's at
[3:56:58] <%TubeMan642> peaches are superior
[3:57:05] <notadeasterisk> you live in canada of course apricots suck
[3:57:06] <+Vigonept> i like dried oranges
[3:57:07] <%Broand> you crazy, you never had apricot jam obv

[3:57:22] <Johannen> Dried apricot are the shit, Kuraga FTW
[3:57:26] <lysolysols> Apricot jam is not bad that’s true
[3:57:28] <heartlesshealer> oh boy vassal nations
[3:57:31] <Blackleafx> Canada, Australia, the British Raj, South Africa...
[3:57:34] <Blackleafx> the four dominions
[3:57:40] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus thats called settlers of catan woolie
[3:57:43] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You aren't in modern times yet
[3:57:45] <+Undenizen> Is this colonialism: the board game?
[3:57:47] <%derap41> non political 4X game imposible
[3:57:51] <+Vigonept> but the slavery and nationalist stuff is the fuj
[3:57:52] <Blackleafx> @Undenizen yes
[3:57:52] <heemwizard> @Undenizen yes
[3:58:13] <Blackleafx> LITERALLY CIV

[3:59:03] <Johannen> Kinda reminds me more of a Archipelago, colonizing the carribean
[3:59:06] <%derap41> @derap41 Why'd they gotta make Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate political

[4:01:44] <heemwizard> thats it
[4:01:44] <%derap41> How can you deny the sailor coat
[4:01:53] <die_hardman> oh my god, why does woolie have to spend 1 hour looking through the inventory :(
[4:01:56] <elshadow7> I like to imagine Harry placing a comically large suitcase on the ground while saying "Hold that thought" and rummaging through pounds of clothing.
[4:02:00] <tequi1asunset> notepad has suggestion
[4:02:11] <heemwizard> play it in the snow
[4:02:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[4:02:33] <%derap41> Just need an excuse any excuse
[4:02:46] <DSD24> Really? On the Sea ice!
[4:03:00] <%derap41> mmm yes of coutse
[4:03:01] <%servicesuspension> binoclards!
[4:03:08] <heartlesshealer> oh man the boys have The Precarious World
[4:03:09] <alexandrecau> Kim just really wants it
[4:03:11] <Johannen> Sure, you conviced me...*heavy sweating
[4:03:21] <DSD24> I bet he's gonna kick your ass
[4:03:27] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[4:03:35] <alexandrecau> You know kim knows the game
[4:03:39] <iacus_> yo, minigame?
[4:03:41] <+Undenizen> i can't believe kim is down for this.
[4:03:43] <Ecall10528> Get ready to get rocked.
[4:03:45] <lysolysols> Ignore the rules when you play.
[4:03:53] <Blackleafx> Kim will minmax
[4:03:54] <+Jeshk0> You got this, Kim! Kick Harry's ass!
[4:03:56] <%derap41> I imagine you both lying no your stomach legs swinging in the air
[4:03:57] <DSD24> Always with the cocaine
[4:04:00] <%heysamuel> schoolboy thrashing time
[4:04:04] <Johannen> This is totaly a board game Archipelago
[4:04:16] <DSD24> Advantage to Kim
[4:04:24] <iacus_> worker placement game
[4:04:27] <codymagpie> kick his butt kim :)
[4:04:31] <%derap41> nah they don't have the budget for that
[4:04:33] <heartlesshealer> kim going for fruits and sugars
[4:04:37] <Blackleafx> can you actually beat kim at this lol
[4:04:43] <elshadow7> That'd be a bit much I think
[4:04:45] <DSD24> Play the long game
[4:04:51] <heemwizard> @Blackleafx there's only one way to beat him
[4:04:54] <lysolysols> The only way to win is choose the “fulfill contract” options every single time.
[4:04:59] <%krispen_wa> @blackleafx its possible, but you need to commit to one strategy
[4:05:01] <%servicesuspension> contract sounds like plus ultra
[4:05:09] <lysolysols> But it’s not as satisfying as fucking the rules.
[4:05:10] <%TheFabledAble> thats what kims doing
[4:05:16] <Miklosher> thats what kim is doing
[4:05:18] <iacus_> rest 1 turn to maximize on future turns
[4:05:19] <%TheFabledAble> kims doing the minmaxing for future turns
[4:05:19] <ariszed> that's 3
[4:05:27] <OblivionSword1> that's 3
[4:05:27] <notadeasterisk> 3?
[4:05:30] <lysolysols> But if you wanna win: fulfill contract each time.
[4:05:33] <JetpackMcQuack> weird
[4:05:35] <codymagpie> :)
[4:05:41] <Blackleafx> NotLikeThis
[4:05:43] <iacus_> oh I see

[4:05:47] <Robot_Nixon_> No help only smiles :)
[4:05:48] <%TheFabledAble> kim did the thing, if you wanna do the thing do what kim did
[4:05:48] <heartlesshealer> kim did sugar and fruit contracts
[4:05:49] <iacus_> it's not very well explained
[4:05:49] <%meniscate> woolie big not read
[4:05:54] <heemwizard> but why would you let your workers rest
[4:05:54] <OblivionSword1> kim did the worker arrange
[4:05:57] <%TheFabledAble> noice
[4:06:02] <Ecall10528> Reading comprehension 0.

[4:06:24] <codymagpie> When you play Catan you DO NOT do what what the winning player does
[4:06:24] <%TheFabledAble> royalty needs their nose candy to handle their duties
[4:06:46] <pyropoyo> hey woolie give buttons' most recent tweet a read when you get the chance

[4:14:58] <brovietto> LUL
[4:14:59] <Blackleafx> One of the weirdest things I learned about opium in China is that it was actually regarded pretty highly as a medicine, until the British flooded the markets with it and it became used as just a drug
[4:14:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HOLY FUCK THIS GAME IS THE BEST

[4:15:29] <%TheFabledAble> specifically it gives you nothing in the game because the desires of the rich are not the interests of 99% of people
[4:15:31] <heartlesshealer> god
[4:15:33] <iacus_> different rules would assign points differently

[4:17:21] <+harmadill0> shit we've let the blinds become literate, this will threaten the fiefdom
[4:17:24] <tattleworm> trade war was the right choice
[4:17:28] <%eanscrale> sounds really familiar somehow
[4:17:29] <Johannen> It warned you to stick with a strategy
[4:17:32] <%teefpal> The game didnt tell me what to do!
[4:17:36] <penitentpendant> (It IS possible to beat Kim, he swears when you do)
[4:17:41] <Picia000123> You can totally win the game btw
[4:17:46] <KaseKaizer> stripSmug
[4:17:48] <heemwizard> geez that took nearly two hours
[4:17:48] <%heysamuel> i've only beaten that lil gamefreak once
[4:17:51] <+Jeshk0> "Hey Kim, now hand me your gun..."
[4:17:57] <elshadow7> On the plus side, it only took you about 2 hours.
[4:17:57] <lysolysols> You can only win if you do a contract each time and finish off with victory column.
[4:18:02] <%eanscrale> Honestly beating Kim is way less satisfying than you might think
[4:18:03] <Mattais88> Smug KIm
[4:18:08] <jigglepants> @NoHopeForMyCuirass Fuckin' disco, sure
[4:18:16] <penitentpendant> Is this worth Killer Queen chat?

[4:26:10] <+Undenizen> he knows.
[4:26:14] <%krispen_wa> Evrart leans in to how much of a shit he is at least
[4:26:14] <heemwizard> @alexandrecau you can
[4:26:20] <heemwizard> not sure if he can pass the check tho

[4:32:41] <%Gruhunchously> I can imagaine Titus Hardie saying that
[4:32:46] <user_naim> Well the voice is the complete opposite, but
[4:32:47] <%derap41> Kim you already know they didn't do it
[4:33:20] <heemwizard> @derap41 yeah this convo was supposed to happen earlier
[4:33:47] <%eanscrale> Only so many bullets and so many heads smart guy
[4:33:49] <Blackleafx> PEAK SLIME
[4:33:50] <nukle0nik> i love this guy
[4:33:51] <alexandrecau> he doesn't know or care he just wants the war
[4:33:51] <mr_sups> He's so SLIMY
[4:33:58] <heemwizard> but i suppose kim wouldnt want to reveal that
[4:34:02] <+NopeBadguy> i'd tell you to arrest this guy but i don't think he could fit into the car
[4:34:03] <penitentpendant> He's slimy, yet he's still better than... THE CENTRIST
[4:34:15] <%derap41> @heemwizard I guess that could work but the dialog is still a little wonky
[4:34:17] <nukle0nik> he's the head "communist" in the game so obviously he's a good guy
[4:34:18] <+mechslayer71> evrart on his Soprano shit
[4:34:26] <iacus_> Sediment is a good name for a PMC
[4:34:35] <+DenpaDev> The peoples gate!
[4:34:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:34:38] <%eanscrale> Evrart works for himself, but the Union believes in him cause he will get the shit done
[4:34:42] <user_naim> @iacus_ it’s weirdly scary
[4:35:21] <alexandrecau> Union believes in him because he spiked the borscht and will have cops open your door if you don'T
[4:35:37] <lysolysols> He doesn’t know about the borscht at all.
[4:35:55] <+Undenizen> I bet this guy becomes a psychopath when he doesn't need to have a face on
[4:35:55] <%derap41> Did Woolie ever get the borchst
[4:36:06] <lysolysols> He did but gave it away to doom spiral
[4:36:08] <heemwizard> @derap41 yeah he gave it to idiot doom spiral
[4:36:46] <%derap41> @derap41 what a waste on a wastrel
[4:36:55] <%teefpal> the hardie boys aren't anywhere near the top of the union heiarchy
[4:36:59] <lysolysols> I think you’re supposed to assume he’s just a “fat evil” character but there is more to him which is interesting, imo.
[4:37:01] <alexandrecau> Evrart knows it's in the cabinet notes he tell the ubi to make sure the borscht gets served

[4:38:54] <heemwizard> @nukle0nik but its the proper pronounciation
[4:38:56] <lysolysols> He’s not mis-pronouncing it on accident. It’s a thing in the game.
[4:38:56] <%notsoy> so fascist, ultraliberal, commie, moralist
[4:38:58] <user_naim> @nukle0nik it’s the bit
[4:38:59] <%Mathochism> The mispronounciation is intentional.
[4:39:02] <Blackleafx> chore nr 2
[4:39:02] <Ecall10528> Woolie is doing it right. @nukle0nik

[5:16:01] <%servicesuspension> Thanks for the stream
[5:16:02] <%TheFabledAble> the reason jeff bezos is bald is so that he's able to more easily bend the light of the net worth coefficient around him to protect his visage from the middle class

[5:17:06] <%SirGO0SE> you're making good pace
[5:17:13] <brunoberserk> it is like playing Skyrim
[5:17:13] <%heysamuel> yeah this is great pace for a first run
[5:17:21] <seriousink> the "main quest" isn't very long, but really the point of the game is to fuck around
[5:17:22] <iacus_> The order you can do stuff in this game can vary A LOT
[5:17:24] <Chatterbox1991> Because Evrart is how you get your gun back
[5:17:29] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus I did it a lot more systematically
[5:17:35] <+mechslayer71> I mean, I've done pretty much all the stuff you guys have done and more, faster. not quite sure how
[5:17:39] <%servicesuspension> fuck around and find out, that'it, that's the game
[5:17:40] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Talk to Cindy about art 😉
[5:17:41] <aiutare47> Woolie, Reggie. Any moment you begin to feel sympathy for Harry, temper that with the knowledge that he beat a homeless man with a clipboard so hard, it crippled them for life.
[5:17:46] <%TheotherKristian> Fam, I got to one of the end points, in THREEE DAYS
[5:17:47] <Deasmeister> This is fun I've never seen ultralib stuff only commie stuff

[5:18:05] <+Jeshk0> its good, just keep on hustling
[5:18:08] <+MightyDuckShoes> Take your time. I accidentally went too far in the main quest and missed a good amount of shit my first time
[5:18:09] <+Vigonept> and i dont think the light bending guy is speciric to ultra libs
