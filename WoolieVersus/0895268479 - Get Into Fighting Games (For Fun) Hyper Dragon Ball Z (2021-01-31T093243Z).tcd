[0:00:14] <+Jerimoi> YOOOOOOOO
[0:00:16] <%SableS139a> Probably. Considering Jiren's lack of character in canon, it's bound to be strength-oriented.

[0:01:49] <andrewofbob> Reggie speaks for all of chat
[0:01:53] <%Jetzord> Saturday Afternoon is alright for fighting
[0:01:56] <+krispen_wa> I contend that Jiren would have been a great meta character on how people like BIG NUMBER characters like Broly even if their personality was terrible, but he had far too much screentime for how lame he was
[0:02:02] <+BettyMwwaahh> slight audio delay
[0:02:02] <%SableS139a> If Cell's theme is a remix of the Cell Ring from Super DBZ when his trailer drops, my pants are officially gone.
[0:02:08] <%yusefHD> Jiren is Incel Broly lmfao
[0:02:10] <%gatorafan> REAL SHIT
[0:02:10] <%ggbhtg> Which Saturday is reserved for Kusoge tho
[0:02:12] <+jbaker009> Discord TO here and There are devs watching. but they cant talk yet since they just followed
[0:02:15] <jamsbybetty> HI REGGIE!! <3
[0:02:16] <mpo9> I think a Jiren is being worked on for the game
[0:02:17] <%gatorafan> KomodoHype
[0:02:25] <brunoberserk> saturday afternoon beastlords
[0:02:40] <entransta> Yeah jiren and Black were planned for this update, but they got delayed due to covid shit
[0:02:49] <@Menitta> Leave Jiren to me
[0:02:53] <Dean_Inbetween> Vegeta has so many mechanics
[0:02:56] <+Ultimate_Edge> Oh he's gonna like it a lot
[0:02:56] <%SableS139a> @krispen_wa Shit like this is why MasakoX is the man we need, but don't deserve. Gives characters love and life that Toriyama never did... And then you're upset that none of his shit's official...
[0:02:57] <Dean_Inbetween> Its so stupid
[0:03:00] <%yusefHD> I got roasted in the DBZ subreddit for this, but in the Broly movie, he's essentially Super Saiyan Green. DBZ RGB confirmed.
[0:03:02] <Dean_Inbetween> I love it
[0:03:06] <+jbaker009> super vegeta us a mishima

Hello I finally decided to try tekken!, I picked first Steve Fox since cool boxer, Turns out he was way more complicated than I thought he was with his stances and counterhits, so after many hours of failure, I decided to switch to more basic characters
[0:03:45] <Dean_Inbetween> I would say they are very CPS3 WHICH IS THE IDEA
[0:03:45] <%Seancicle> Seancicle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Contexte manquant. Reggie, wrapped season 3 of Cobra Kai. What a bop. Woolie I'm gonna fax you some glitter; maybe not with that attitude. ü§üüèª friends

[0:04:02] <Dean_Inbetween> @sables139a he has too many layers he‚Äôs like shrek
[0:04:05] <TheactualDiepod> HDBZ was supposed to be if capcom made a dbz game around the time CVS happened
[0:04:08] <@Menitta> I wanna get that one DBZ game by Arc on 3DS

[0:12:13] <JetpackMcQuack> They found what pwoplw like
[0:12:15] <%ggbhtg> they run on TV SO OFTEN, it makes it difficult to sit down SPECIFICALLY to watch them start to end
[0:12:16] <%Triforce505> harms many, maybe only killed one
[0:12:17] <+jbaker009> oh yeah lol
[0:12:19] <%SableS139a> @Dean_Inbetween I just want a Chi-Chi trailer so I can hear his CPS2 track for her in the game at this point.
[0:12:24] <Applecannon63> YEEEEEEA
[0:12:26] <brachydios777> Only one guy dies in Rambo 1
[0:12:30] <Davimotion96> First Blood is more about PTSD and returning to America after Vietnam
[0:12:33] <zenith0111> Wasn't First Blood a book?
[0:12:33] <EnnuiOnStream> They drew first blood!
[0:12:39] <%Triforce505> rambo first blood is fucking great
[0:12:44] <Dean_Inbetween> The later movies completed ignore the fact that rambo is a damaged war vet
[0:12:53] <Davimotion96> Rambo said ACAB
[0:12:56] <brachydios777> It was based off a book
[0:12:57] <%patriotrenegade> RAMBEAU
[0:13:09] <+thedream_c> makes sense. As that franchise ages they forget the details of John Rambo
[0:13:25] <Dean_Inbetween> @sables139a I would love chi chi in more games, thats why im also happy with bulma in a mech too
[0:13:25] <+thedream_c> reminded me of Punisher presented to media
[0:13:27] <%yusefHD> Rambrau the bootleg German version lmao
[0:13:42] <%yusefHD> R O S E B U D
[0:13:43] <brachydios777> Mk 11 is more respectful to John Rambo than Rambo 5
[0:13:46] <Gloppie> Is the audio desynced for anyone else? Or is it on my end?
[0:13:53] <%yusefHD> Yeah, it's off by a bit
[0:13:53] <Kaji04> was about to ask

[0:15:10] <%SableS139a> Shit makes me mad that these dudes aren't composing tracks in the actual industry. Lord knows that more fighting games nowadays could use memorable tracks like theirs.

[0:31:09] <jasonisgold79> I will say the custom VA work in this game is interesting. Like it's not bad, it's just interesting to see different takes on these characters who, at least over here in the west, have had a certain set of iconic voices for years now.
[0:31:11] <Super_Voltekka> The guy who voiced Abacchio

[0:33:00] <@Menitta> wtf I;m a conductor?
[0:33:00] <Vashido22> the only downside of this games is that its mugen
[0:33:06] <+Superbro64> use the numkeys
[0:33:10] <Dean_Inbetween> I love that it makes a winding down noise when you back out this game is so charming
[0:33:18] <+Superbro64> mugen defaults p2 to numkeys
[0:33:20] <dastmwolf> it's the good type of Jani tho. something awesome awaits
[0:33:26] <+Ultimate_Edge> Quirks like this are features of mugen :)
[0:33:33] <dastmwolf> jank lol
[0:33:35] <%LordSDB> No Prep, keep it all live
[0:33:37] <brunoberserk> S O O N
[0:33:39] <+jbaker009> i really hope they decide to move to Ikemen Go the new mugen engine
[0:33:45] <Applecannon63> technical difficulties are a thing you know?

[0:34:36] <%SableS139a> @HolyGriddles This game actually has legit stage variety. Unlike FighterZ.
[0:34:40] <Dean_Inbetween> Mugen is a strange beast
[0:34:41] <Pookiedaexzile> ONE GUY
[0:34:47] <%Kriss1827> maybe reggie has to set his buttons?

[0:36:12] <+Dova573> think sf4
[0:36:16] <%ggbhtg> 2 lights, 2 mids, 2 heavys

[0:36:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> !uptime
[0:36:55] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 51 minutes and 22 seconds
[0:36:58] <jasonisgold79> Yeah last I tried this, this isn't like FighterZ. More akin to Street Fighter. Or I guess in this case that DBZ fighting game that was designed and developed by one of the Street Figther devs.
[0:37:03] <Dean_Inbetween> Its a fucking Wikipedia article lol
[0:37:03] <@SoushinSen> look at this motherfucker's number of tabs
[0:37:08] <+relentingapunch> Jesus
[0:37:15] <%ggbhtg> You won't find 25% of the moves WITHOUT this page
[0:37:23] <brachydios777> UNLIMITED TAB WORKS
[0:37:32] <Applecannon63> Hyper Dragon Ballz is inspired by Super Dragon Ball fighting from 8ing?
[0:37:33] <+SaurianCrash> thats not tabs i think
[0:37:33] <Dean_Inbetween> JUST LIKE OLD ARCADE GAMES
[0:37:37] <%Seancicle> @soushinsen üòÖüëàüèª
[0:37:37] <Dean_Inbetween> Ugh
[0:37:44] <%ekodrop> too many
[0:37:49] <jasonisgold79> Yeah the learning curve for this is pretty steep. But it looks amazing.
[0:37:53] <+relentingapunch> Jesus
[0:37:54] <deafmelone> yeah it is
[0:37:55] <%SableS139a> SO FUCKING MUCH
[0:37:57] <%SableS139a> I LOVE IT
[0:37:59] <Aganok_> yeah, there's a shit ton of thing to almost every character
[0:37:59] <DingusMcBaseball> base goku got a lot of new stuff in this update, he was pretty basic before
[0:38:00] <%ggbhtg> YOU WOULD NEVER MASH THEM ALL OUT
[0:38:04] <Dean_Inbetween> AND ITS BASIC GOKU TOO
[0:38:04] <%IcedTorch> try turtle flip into punch for a special move called "the biter"
[0:38:05] <+relentingapunch> God this is so extra
[0:38:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Aight which side character is gonna get the most tho
[0:38:13] <deafmelone> based off super dbz
[0:38:15] <brunoberserk> turtle flip is akuma's demon flip
[0:38:15] <%ggbhtg> YOU WOULD NEVER MASH THEM ALL OUT, NEVA Evaaaaa
[0:38:18] <Pookiedaexzile> You know the creators fave is getting the good shit
[0:38:26] <+awesomeguy423> @Pookiedaexzile Krillin has an absurd amount of shit
[0:38:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> you don't understand. Goku's moveset in UNFINISHED without those stationary kamehamehas he used in tbe Freiza fight. I'm not joking
[0:38:35] <BlackermanZX> did they see the SSJ Goku supers?
[0:38:37] <+Chili_Daddy> I love all the installs they're so call
[0:38:38] <+Chili_Daddy> cool
[0:38:43] <+relentingapunch> Spirit bomb
[0:38:44] <%SableS139a> The fact that everyone has so much versatility means that almost any playstyle is available for each character. This is the kind of shit that I'm a fan of.
[0:38:45] <+relentingapunch> Nice
[0:38:45] <crimsonsaens> Probably the only game I enjoy playing Goku in.
[0:38:50] <+HolyGriddles> Does Candy Gogeta have his own move list? doodAnime
[0:38:52] <jasonisgold79> Plus there's a lot of effort and love put into this. I might not play this or play it a lot, but even a casual like me and see and appreciate the amount of effort, detail, and love the devs of this fan games have done. <3
[0:38:55] <+awesomeguy423> @HolyGriddles yes
[0:38:57] <ozmon> I like the idea of backdash unique traits
[0:39:01] <brunoberserk> every character has a super mode
[0:39:08] <+HolyGriddles> Amazing
[0:39:11] <+awesomeguy423> not quite
[0:39:11] <%ggbhtg> Super DBZ is too recent. This is based off Butoden
[0:39:17] <Dean_Inbetween> Goku and base vegeta aren‚Äôt even that updated too AND THEY ARE STILL A LOT @woolieversus
[0:39:24] <+awesomeguy423> candy vegeta, babadi, and pilaf have no modes
[0:39:25] <BlackermanZX> SSJ Goku and Vegeta have the best supers in this game
[0:39:33] <Vashido22> dont forget ex moves
[0:39:34] <+relentingapunch> This dude has a command run too
[0:39:36] <+relentingapunch> GOD
[0:39:37] <Kaji04> lol, vegeta gets a chad walk
[0:39:42] <+awesomeguy423> Does anyone have a complete voice cast listing for this game
[0:39:54] <Aganok_> yeah, both SSJ have an insane amount of stuff
[0:39:54] <+Superbro64> @woolieversus game has ex moves too
[0:39:55] <+relentingapunch> There is so much here how does one even begin to consider neutral options
[0:39:59] <%ggbhtg> We got EXs too @woolieversus
[0:40:03] <jasonisgold79> Plus didn't they add like Blue Gok & Vegeta in this update? Or are they just more or less color swaps of SSJ Goku & Vegeta.
[0:40:06] <Dean_Inbetween> @awesomeguy423 green slug man - diepod Kappa
[0:40:11] <%SableS139a> Goku's command dash used to be a rekka, but it was completely changed to take advantage of his new Kaio-Ken Install super and the amount of shit you can pull off with it.
[0:40:21] <Applecannon63> Foot dive!?
[0:40:23] <Aganok_> @jasonisgold79 they're installs iirc
[0:40:25] <+awesomeguy423> @jasonisgold79 SSGSS are installs for SSJ Goku and Vegeta
[0:40:31] <%ggbhtg> Banzai
[0:40:35] <+relentingapunch> Literal ex tatsu
[0:40:46] <Applecannon63> almost sound like it
[0:40:47] <%IcedTorch> its a grab
[0:40:48] <Vashido22> grab
[0:40:51] <Vashido22> BITE
[0:40:52] <%IcedTorch> the BITER
[0:40:56] <+relentingapunch> Command grabs?
[0:40:56] <jasonisgold79> Alright, enlighten my dumb Casual brain, what are installs again?
[0:40:57] <%ggbhtg> The Frieza bite
[0:40:58] <%IcedTorch> Goku hungry
[0:41:03] <brunoberserk> NOT THE HEADBITE
[0:41:04] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo, nice deep cut
[0:41:05] <deafmelone> @woolieversus Activating everyones unique install changes their lv3
[0:41:09] <+awesomeguy423> @jasonisgold79 a special "mode"
[0:41:09] <+hakma> @jasonisgold79 forms
[0:41:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> saiyans is houngry
[0:41:14] <%SableS139a> @jasonisgold79 Yep. Goku's Instinct Mode now has him go Blue while SSJ Vegeta does the same, though he can push it to Indigo with enough meter.
[0:41:15] <Shade075> Goku's strongest move, the bite
[0:41:17] <jasonisgold79> Gotcha.
[0:41:21] <+relentingapunch> @jasonisgold79 Installs are forms that change your character into another character
[0:41:23] <TheactualDiepod> They gave yung Goku a lot of stuff bruh
[0:41:28] <KgKid51> so cool man
[0:41:28] <+SaurianCrash> call them modes i would say
[0:41:30] <brachydios777> I love it has a King Kai timer
[0:41:33] <+relentingapunch> See: Sol‚Äôs Dragon Install
[0:41:33] <Dean_Inbetween> Vegeta has two fucking installs
[0:41:35] <DreamOfFrogs> dat damage drain though
[0:41:42] <DreamOfFrogs> heath drain*
[0:41:44] <Rykorr> goku has a whole rekka system with his 214 punch
[0:41:45] <+HolyGriddles> The little King Kai bar for Kiaoken doodThirst
[0:41:47] <SonicD4> IAD
[0:41:51] <+TheLakinessMonster> Damn, these sprites are neat
[0:41:55] <+relentingapunch> Oh fuck you can go KaiohKen?
[0:41:57] <jasonisgold79> Much like the move in the anime, Goku takes damage when using the Kaioken.
[0:42:03] <cocobody> Clean sprites
[0:42:07] <+awesomeguy423> @TheLakinessMonster this game has been like eight+ years in the making
[0:42:09] <Applecannon63> oh jeez the health is drain from that install
[0:42:10] <+awesomeguy423> the sprites are gorgeous
[0:42:15] <%SableS139a> @WoolieVersus You can cancel into just about any special with Kaio-Ken active from another special, so long as you're not doing the same on twice in a row and have health to spare.
[0:42:18] <SonicD4> look at those legs breathe doodThirst
[0:42:19] <jasonisgold79> Yeah the Sprite Art in this is SOOOOOOO good!
[0:42:26] <%Seancicle> big snoof woolieFUN
[0:42:27] <+relentingapunch> Yo imagine stuffing that teleport super
[0:42:28] <BlackermanZX> Base goku and vegeta are like the oldest characters and they still have a LOT
[0:42:36] <Applecannon63> that teleport has follow ups
[0:42:45] <Aganok_> they have been updated over time as well afaik
[0:42:45] <brunoberserk> is a combo starter
[0:42:51] <+awesomeguy423> for reference they had a playable demo of this game with about half this roster at EVO *2014*
[0:42:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> man they even tell you how to use the moves too thats crazy
[0:42:54] <jasonisgold79> One of the reasons I got wind of this game. Mostly because I'm a sucker for good Sprite Art.
[0:42:56] <Pookiedaexzile> But your position is the same everytime
[0:42:59] <Vashido22> dont forget you have lvl2 versions
[0:43:07] <+Ultimate_Edge> YEA YEA YEA
[0:43:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> OH
[0:43:12] <+awesomeguy423> I'm a dirty casual who only saw this game because of Max
[0:43:12] <+relentingapunch> OH FUCK
[0:43:13] <%ChoculaUltra> yoooooo
[0:43:13] <ozmon> There's a lot of stuff to the "Ryu" of the game
[0:43:16] <nailwind> thats beyond sick
[0:43:16] <SonicD4> hope mode
[0:43:18] <+Chili_Daddy> you haven't seen shit yet that's the best part
[0:43:19] <+krispen_wa> yoooooo
[0:43:21] <%ggbhtg> Instinct Mode boys
[0:43:21] <+TheLakinessMonster> beautiful
[0:43:22] <+relentingapunch> Hope!
[0:43:34] <+relentingapunch> Rad
[0:43:38] <BlackermanZX> Full hope mode has a big lvl3
[0:43:41] <+relentingapunch> Oh and it dizzies?
[0:43:48] <%ggbhtg> MADA MADA
[0:43:51] <%ekodrop> not enough hope
[0:43:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:43:55] <DreamOfFrogs> just like the anime, full spirit bomb and the lesser variant
[0:43:57] <+Basilias_Maximus> Gather the power, and then do level 3.
[0:44:00] <jasonisgold79> I think the full charge is basically what he does in FighterZ.
[0:44:02] <KgKid51> Hope Bar!
[0:44:02] <Pookiedaexzile> the HOPE BAR
[0:44:04] <SonicD4> level 3 super changes based on the install mode meter
[0:44:07] <%ggbhtg> aint nobody seen nothing yet
[0:44:11] <+relentingapunch> Hope Bar fuck yes
[0:44:14] <Aganok_> you'll be here for 3~4 hours before you see all the stuff in the game
[0:44:20] <Aganok_> not even kidding
[0:44:21] <BlackermanZX> yeah lvl3 supers changes based on the bars
[0:44:32] <%ekodrop> homework
[0:44:34] <%ggbhtg> RATE THE SUPER Kappa
[0:44:34] <Dean_Inbetween> @woolieversus also if you kill with level 3s they each have there own unique death animation
[0:44:36] <Pookiedaexzile> You didn't do your homework
[0:44:39] <Vashido22> lvl3 supers will change depending on the lvl of the installs
[0:44:39] <SonicD4> Max spent a whole night just gushing over the game with no gameplay
[0:44:39] <+Chili_Daddy> check out all finishers for lvl3s
[0:44:40] <+HolyGriddles> Didn‚Äôt Max quit doing the Rate the Super for this since their is so many and it took him hours?
[0:44:40] <Applecannon63> Â∏åÊúõ
[0:44:48] <KgKid51> rate the super hggLul hggLul hggLul
[0:44:49] <Dean_Inbetween> Yeah this will take multiple sessions at least
[0:44:51] <%IcedTorch> Every char has a lv3 that can be upgraded during the emotion mode of every char ( dd mk mp ) other than that you can also cancel the mode doing DD mp mk, each char upgrades the lv3 differently according to the movelist ( goku is just charging up )
[0:44:53] <SonicD4> @HolyGriddles doodLUL
[0:44:56] <Mr_Rakjo> it is
[0:44:58] <BlackermanZX> yo uhave to do kaioken

[0:45:05] <%JustToWatch> this is what the pre voice acted disco elysium stream would look like
[0:45:07] <+JaseAdrift> Its in there
[0:45:08] <Aganok_> @HolyGriddles pretty much, but there might be a video yet LUL
[0:45:12] <Applecannon63> @holygriddles he did a lv3 rate the supers tho
[0:45:19] <+SaurianCrash> theres a video for all the supers
[0:45:22] <TheactualDiepod> It does during kaioken
[0:45:30] <Mr_Rakjo> @WoolieVersus there is one cinematic fullscreen for all characters its the lvl 3 supers
[0:45:33] <%McSoliace> the kaioken has a super in depth super
[0:45:41] <%Areus> Areus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! ravageBig ravageRig ravageRig ravageRig
[0:45:41] <Dean_Inbetween> Lol thats reserved for ssj goku woolie the super spirit bomb
[0:45:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> @sauriancrash its like 30 minutes, isn't it?
[0:45:50] <DingusMcBaseball> sex kicks
[0:45:51] <+SaurianCrash> i think?
[0:45:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ahh, Haggar strats
[0:45:55] <SonicD4> does that LK crossup?
[0:45:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> plus THIS GAME IS SICK
[0:46:06] <+zacyzacy> is this an arcade game?
[0:46:10] <Dean_Inbetween> Sex kicks from smash
[0:46:15] <deafmelone> the lv3 s changed depending on the level your hope mode
[0:46:15] <Aganok_> @zacyzacy Mugen fan-made game
[0:46:17] <+Superbro64> @dingusmcbaseball considering thats a smash term, that is hilarious in hindsight
[0:46:19] <Aganok_> on PC
[0:46:22] <brachydios777> @zacyzacy Mugen
[0:46:32] <%IcedTorch> Every char has a lv3 that can be upgraded during the emotion mode of every char ( dd mk mp ) other than that you can also cancel the mode doing DD mp mk, each char upgrades the lv3 differently according to the movelist ( goku is just charging up ). So every char has a lv3 with 4 flavours to it, the basic the lv1 2 and 3.

[0:47:05] <%Jetzord> you can follow up the flip with a kick
[0:47:07] <+HotSnake1989> Thank you for all the laughs over the years buddy, hope you have a great weekend
[0:47:10] <Applecannon63> Vegeta with a the Bison float back
[0:47:11] <+Coltbanana> hey woolie
[0:47:13] <+HolyGriddles> Does Woolie know about Piccolos lvl 3 finisher, I wonder?
[0:47:17] <+Coltbanana> hows the bacon did you say?
[0:47:21] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Braykyu!
[0:47:31] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus every lvl3 changes based on the super mode bars. Goku's hope mode changes the Kaioken super
[0:47:34] <Vashido22> woolie goku can air dash from his backdash
[0:47:34] <SonicD4> diepod!
[0:47:38] <%ggbhtg> You gotta do your LV3 with different amounts of your instinct meter filled, in order to see different cinematics. @woolieversus
[0:47:40] <Applecannon63> hah I get it because Veg(a)eta
[0:47:46] <+HolyGriddles> No spoilers chat
[0:47:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> CHAT: no spoilers on supers plz
[0:47:55] <Theroyalrabite> Since the last you played, quite a lot of balancing work has been done
[0:48:09] <Dean_Inbetween> Welp then they probably wont scratch the suface then..
[0:48:12] <%IcedTorch> Every char has a lv3 that can be upgraded during the emotion mode of every char ( dd mk mp ) other than that you can also cancel the mode doing DD mp mk, each char upgrades the lv3 differently according to the movelist ( goku is just charging up ). So every char has a lv3 with 4 flavours to it, the basic the lv1 2 and 3.
[0:48:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Is toughlovearena ever getting another look
[0:48:20] <BlackermanZX> it was not
[0:48:22] <+Coltbanana> @woolieversus you need to do down down medium punch
[0:48:35] <+Coltbanana> then do the various level 1/2/3s
[0:48:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> All emotion activations are same buttons 22 both Mids
[0:48:46] <%ggbhtg> what Colt said
[0:48:49] <+Basilias_Maximus> It's the snk motion.
[0:48:51] <Mr_Rakjo> Kaiken Assault
[0:48:58] <+Coltbanana> I've dev tested this game a lot.
[0:49:03] <%Jetzord> mash that shit
[0:49:07] <+matteasy31> KEKW
[0:49:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:49:09] <SonicD4> not max damage
[0:49:12] <nailwind> dynamic pose
[0:49:15] <+Coltbanana> just dropping by to see the reactions
[0:49:18] <Super_Voltekka> Just like in OG Budokai LUL
[0:49:23] <KgKid51> yoo
[0:49:24] <Vashido22> kaioken assault is the lvl3
[0:49:28] <jasonisgold79> That's a good line "HELL'S WAITING FOR YOU!"
[0:49:28] <+Ultimate_Edge> Its so good, and that wasn't even the final version
[0:49:32] <Dean_Inbetween> Oh cool @coltbanana then you can enlighten us
[0:49:39] <powerprotoman> now do that at max mope mode
[0:49:39] <Vashido22> thats the one that changes on install
[0:49:41] <BlackermanZX> do that one with full hope bar
[0:49:42] <+matteasy31> Insane animations tho
[0:49:43] <ozmon> Badass
[0:49:43] <%ggbhtg> down down MP is to activate your instinct mode @woolieversus
[0:49:45] <powerprotoman> hope*
[0:49:52] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Sick animation.
[0:49:55] <+Superbro64> kaioken assault after instinct mode
[0:49:56] <+awesomeguy423> Buu has about a hundred(100)different sprites for winposes depending on who he "absorbs", including specific ones for Yamcha, Guile, Kung Fu Man, and *every Sailor Scout*
[0:49:56] <%IcedTorch> if you are holding genkidama while doing that genkidama beatup moveyou get different enders
[0:49:59] <Mr_Rakjo> @WoolieVersus the last one Kaioken Assault has 3 variations depending on your hope meter
[0:50:00] <+SaurianCrash> if he can beam clash
[0:50:07] <Vashido22> dont charge it
[0:50:15] <jasonisgold79> @WoolieVersus Maybe when we reach the end for this, we could check out the trailer for this build and see what we missed during your time playing.
[0:50:17] <redrins> install+super is what you want
[0:50:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man between this and fighterZ dragon ball fans sure are eating good...now if only this game had 21
[0:50:25] <jasonisgold79> @WoolieVersus Basically what you did last time.
[0:50:27] <+awesomeguy423> 21 is for coomers
[0:50:31] <SonicD4> level 1 cinematic
[0:50:37] <%Jetzord> it changes based on rage level
[0:50:38] <+awesomeguy423> (so yeah I want 21 too)
[0:50:44] <Theroyalrabite> IcedTorch is one of the main devs of the game, btw
[0:50:53] <+Coltbanana> @woolieversus down down mp
[0:50:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:50:53] <DingusMcBaseball> get the meter up
[0:50:55] <%ggbhtg> Vegeta has to charge his Instinct DIFFERENTLY. Every one has a personal charge method. @woolieversus
[0:51:11] <Dean_Inbetween> ^^^
[0:51:11] <+Ultimate_Edge> Vegeta's second bar is charged with ki blasts
[0:51:13] <SonicD4> genkai dama!!!
[0:51:20] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus now do it but with the meter not filled
[0:51:21] <nailwind> full episode of bodying
[0:51:25] <DreamOfFrogs> god damn this thing has layers
[0:51:28] <Garrett1405> Chat's waiting for funtime bingo
[0:51:29] <%ggbhtg> THAT'S NOT EVEN IT
[0:51:33] <DingusMcBaseball> different levels of meter changes the super
[0:51:35] <%ggbhtg> Vegeta has to charge his Instinct DIFFERENTLY. Every one has a personal charge method. @woolieversus
[0:51:36] <SonicD4> he has to charge his bar somehow
[0:51:39] <+JaseAdrift> BUT WAIT...THERE
[0:51:40] <redrins> gotta fill your instinct meter
[0:51:40] <+Basilias_Maximus> Everyone has 3 different ones.
[0:51:43] <%IcedTorch> he needs to fil up the bar first, every char has a bar during that mode that can be filled.
[0:51:44] <+HolyGriddles> But wait, theirs more
[0:51:44] <Aganok_> we're not even close to peak HDBZ
[0:51:47] <+Coltbanana> each level after d d mp will have different levels of the special @woolieversus
[0:51:48] <ThatDudeSmoke> I remember this game, I found a TOD with Majin Vegeta and the devs ended up nerfing the character
[0:51:50] <%Kriss1827> every instinct meter is different wools
[0:52:16] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus the different levels of instinct have different lvl3 cinematics. You saw the lvl3, you didn't see 1 and 2
[0:52:26] <Rykorr> do the level 1 and 2 variations
[0:52:30] <+Ultimate_Edge> CHECK THIS COOL SHIT OUT
[0:52:32] <SonicD4> pretty firewords
[0:52:33] <redrins> they gotta check super sayin gokus it's the shit
[0:52:38] <jasonisgold79> If Goku does his Level 3 with full instinct. Would he say he that would be his "Ultra Instinct"? ....I'll see myself out.
[0:52:47] <Garrett1405> WHERE'S FUNTIME BINGO?
[0:52:51] <+kenyr> this game is so flashy
[0:52:55] <+Coltbanana> @jasonisgold79 p.much
[0:53:05] <SonicD4> grapic glitch on that grass LUL
[0:53:05] <%SableS139a> @Garrett1405 SSJ Vegeta only, my dude.
[0:53:06] <BlackermanZX> @jasonisgold79 WELL..
[0:53:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It persists through the rounds too, so you can save it for Round 2/3, etc
[0:53:15] <Dean_Inbetween> @woolieversus AND they each have theyre own animation if you kill with them
[0:53:17] <Vashido22> now lvl2
[0:53:17] <SocialMisfitGamer> I AM LITERALLY PLAYING THIS!

[0:53:58] <redrins> half yeah
[0:53:59] <Vashido22> half bar for the other one
[0:54:00] <SonicD4> nope
[0:54:01] <Garrett1405> Does Vegeta or Super Vegeta have funtime bingo?
[0:54:05] <%IcedTorch> only the lv3 specific move changes. :)
[0:54:08] <SocialMisfitGamer> Only one Level 3 improves from the Power Mode
[0:54:25] <%ggbhtg> @garrett1405 it's in there

[0:54:54] <jasonisgold79> @Coltbanana Well if you were, then hope have a good day and thanks for making an amazing fan game.
[0:54:55] <+Basilias_Maximus> You don't have to Kaioken first. Just the snk super.
[0:54:55] <DingusMcBaseball> yo play 2x2 co-op its mad fun
[0:54:56] <+Ultimate_Edge> AND THAT WAS JUST TWO CHARACTERS
[0:54:58] <BlackermanZX> check the SSJ versions
[0:55:01] <%Jetzord> Goku best Chiropractor
[0:55:03] <DreamOfFrogs> I can't believe this is Mugen
[0:55:07] <%ggbhtg> IMPOSSIBURU
[0:55:08] <redrins> at least check out ssj
[0:55:11] <Vashido22> Check the ssj super tho
[0:55:11] <SonicD4> @TheactualDiepod doodThirst doodThirst
[0:55:13] <%JustToWatch> it took max hours
[0:55:13] <%IcedTorch> this is a labour of love :) try out ssj goku and ssj vegeta finishers
[0:55:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Learn while ya play
[0:55:16] <Pookiedaexzile> 7 Goku/Vegetas
[0:55:17] <platformerkar64> I love this game sooooo much! Its way too hype PogChamp
[0:55:20] <Theroyalrabite> Please make sure to keep in mind these supers and finishers scale a lot as your combo chain gets higher
[0:55:22] <Dean_Inbetween> It will :3
[0:55:26] <Samex_Comex> The arcade mode is fun too the AI is no pushover
[0:55:28] <+awesomeguy423> @IcedTorch how much would I ahve to pay you to make official H C18 edit
[0:55:30] <+HolyGriddles> Piccolo finisher too
[0:55:31] <Super_Voltekka> SUPER SHOWCASE
[0:55:31] <jasonisgold79> Would it be appropriate to say this is the Alpha 3 of DB fighting games?
[0:55:35] <+Garcian_Ulmeyda> PICCOLO
[0:55:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> I remember the vid on the old channel and them doing co op arcade and struggling against the 2 gold freizas
[0:55:43] <BlackermanZX> i think theres a super compilation video too
[0:55:48] <%IcedTorch> the finishers are more like super taunts, in that you wont be able to pull them out on a real fight unless you are styling all over the other guy
[0:55:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MR.SATAN IS HYPE (literally)
[0:55:51] <+awesomeguy423> @jasonisgold79 yes and no, A3 has a lot of reused assets but this has NONE
[0:55:53] <SocialMisfitGamer> Movelist is very detailed but I don't think it will be to the point where you'll spend entire stream time
[0:55:55] <%ggbhtg> You could check how to charge your Instincts first at least, maybe? @woolieversus
[0:56:01] <%JustToWatch> You have to check out ssj goku's supers though
[0:56:05] <+matteasy31> The good old days :(

[0:56:56] <%Jetzord> woolieMIRIN
[0:56:57] <SocialMisfitGamer> Vegito was supposed to be an April Fool's character, but everyone loved it so now he's real
[0:56:58] <%ggbhtg> @socialmisfitgamer why are you telling meeee that?
[0:56:59] <jasonisgold79> Actually I messed up, I meant the Third Strike of DB games.
[0:57:00] <DreamOfFrogs> haha this is fantastic fan service
[0:57:01] <BlackermanZX> Candy Vegetto is the best
[0:57:05] <%LordSDB> Imagine getting rekt by candy
[0:57:06] <%SableS139a> To be fair, Candy Vegito is fucking nuts when you learn him.
[0:57:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Why isn't this on Salty Bet
[0:57:17] <%JustToWatch> dragonball is so fucking dumb. I love it
[0:57:18] <nailwind> Candy's got combos
[0:57:18] <ozmon> This guy better not have a 3-page moveset too
[0:57:18] <Applecannon63> Vegeto is april fools
[0:57:21] <%blastyoboots> there's got to be an uncandify move
[0:57:23] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm seeing a future champion
[0:57:29] <jasonisgold79> Like this is the unofficial Third Strike while FighterZ is the official rep.
[0:57:31] <Reckless_Rob> 18 is so cool in this
[0:57:32] <jasonisgold79> IMO.
[0:57:33] <+Ultimate_Edge> Vegito the "Jawbreaker"
[0:57:39] <%Ecchigun> lol a candy that powers up
[0:57:39] <SonicD4> did your charge low profile those blasts?
[0:57:51] <300coolfactsaboutbears> L E T H A L L E A G U E
[0:57:51] <%ggbhtg> oop aaaaaw
[0:57:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'm waiting for MAXIMUM POWERLEVEL. When that guy comes out, it's gonna be sick
[0:57:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:58:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> what's Candy Vegito's installs looking like? Sour Cherry Install? Choco Mint level 3s?
[0:58:02] <Applecannon63> 18 straights up has a dr doom super
[0:58:03] <Theroyalrabite> candy vegetto has a much smaller movelist than the rest of the cast, given that he was initially an april fools joke/sprite challenge character (he has very few sprites in comparison)
[0:58:03] <SonicD4> cant manually charge
[0:58:06] <%ggbhtg> sometimes LUL
[0:58:11] <jasonisgold79> You know you're in trouble when you get your ass handed to you by a fucking gumball.
[0:58:20] <BlackermanZX> 18 has pretty much fulgore's meter
[0:58:25] <Reckless_Rob> Cant read a candy's moves!
[0:58:29] <%ggbhtg> You picked one of the FEW characters with an instinct mode downside Reggie LUL
[0:58:29] <%IcedTorch> Jawbreaker was an april fools mini release :)
[0:58:46] <%Jetzord> Dunk him Reggie!
[0:59:00] <brachydios777> Beaten by candy
[0:59:03] <%ggbhtg> DASH DANCING LMAO
[0:59:03] <nailwind> the candy tech
[0:59:03] <+Basilias_Maximus> @WoolieWoolz They also added focus attacks since you last played.
[0:59:05] <+HolyGriddles> Yo, waiting on that high-level Pilaf plays
[0:59:08] <ShinMaddrox> What a Jaw breaker
[0:59:09] <300coolfactsaboutbears> reggie fights his demons

[1:01:29] <mpo9> but it's still jank
[1:01:30] <jasonisgold79> Love me a good character that can STOMP!
[1:01:30] <SocialMisfitGamer> Pilaf, Vegito, and Babidi are the only characters without Power Modes due to them being sort of joke characters
[1:01:36] <mpo9> the mugen devs are AWOL
[1:01:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> remember, yall. Woolie was out the Mugen game since the great memory wipe of 20xx
[1:01:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It's West City all over again
[1:01:51] <Theroyalrabite> pilaf is not a joke character, he's just not complete
[1:01:58] <KgKid51> 18 is really good in this lol
[1:02:26] <brunoberserk> 18 is really T H I C C in this game
[1:02:28] <Aganok_> that 18 backwalk animation is powerful stuff
[1:02:31] <+alphaprotoshow> I voice Goku. Painwheel's voice actress is 18.
[1:02:46] <%ggbhtg> see how to use ya Instinct mode at least
[1:02:49] <jasonisgold79> @alphaprotoshow Oh you're Goku's VA in this?

[1:03:28] <deafmelone> your goku is great man!
[1:03:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, he gets an 8-way in his instinct!
[1:03:37] <+HolyGriddles> @orpleborple Yeah, kind of dumb he‚Äôs in half of her moves, when they just ended up adding him as a separate character

[1:05:06] <KgKid51> WOW
[1:05:06] <Aganok_> yeah, they're both pulling heavily from the source material, so it's bound to have a lot of overlap

[1:06:52] <powerprotoman> shout outs to diepod voice of piccolo did a great job
[1:06:53] <+thedream_c> of course the stretchy limbs
[1:06:55] <SonicD4> nice piccolo voice too
[1:06:59] <Reckless_Rob> But he has old man namek muscles
[1:07:02] <%IcedTorch> Piccolo is voiced by Diepod.
[1:07:05] <Aganok_> there's a surprising amount of "joke" characters that actually work in this
[1:07:06] <DingusMcBaseball> damn
[1:07:07] <%SableS139a> >tfw Satan evolved from a joke character to someone legit awesome
[1:07:07] <+keliff> plant defense?
[1:07:10] <%SableS139a> >feelsgoodman
[1:07:11] <orpleborple> 18 is so freaking cool and i feel like dbfz didn‚Äôt do her enough justice
[1:07:15] <BlackermanZX> Piccolo is sick af in this game
[1:07:18] <Applecannon63> Hey Woolie is playing diepod
[1:07:31] <+keliff> WORD?
[1:07:34] <+thedream_c> lmao the rng
[1:07:36] <Super_Voltekka> LEI-LEI TECH LUL
[1:07:36] <nailwind> throw that nuke
[1:07:37] <Dean_Inbetween> @woolieversus diepod is piccolo
[1:07:40] <%ggbhtg> Piccolo is voiced by Diepod from like 7 years ago btw LUL @woolieversus
[1:07:44] <+AlcesRex> Piccolo looks like he's got Big Buttons
[1:07:47] <jasonisgold79> So for the devs whoa are in chat right now. Gotta ask, which character was the most fun to work on for this?
[1:07:54] <Reckless_Rob> Dat steel drum though
[1:07:57] <%Asuterisuku> Satan probably WOULD be the strongest human if it weren't for Krillin.
[1:08:01] <%IcedTorch> Piccolo is a charge character with scorpion vibes, Satan is a high mobility character with adon like kicks
[1:08:01] <SonicD4> doodShine chatroom
[1:08:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> there's no way Satan is just Teddie-ing mfs right now
[1:08:10] <+hakma> @Asuterisuku Tien too
[1:08:11] <300coolfactsaboutbears> and tien
[1:08:15] <Aganok_> and Yamcha
[1:08:19] <Reckless_Rob> @Asuterisuku Well I mean Tien and Yamcha can wack his ass too
[1:08:21] <Dean_Inbetween> If mr satan learned ki he legitimately would be probably the strongest human
[1:08:22] <%IcedTorch> Gotenks was very fun, but Jiren is being even better.
[1:08:24] <Aganok_> and Tao Tao Pai Pai
[1:08:30] <+Superbro64> good ol mugen txt file movelists Kreygasm
[1:08:31] <robotman37> @jasonisgold79 I feel like they had more fun making gotenks
[1:08:33] <KgKid51> and roshi
[1:08:40] <Shade075> And Roshi...and Tien...and Choatsu
[1:08:42] <jasonisgold79> @Asuterisuku Well technically he's the strongest human that doesn't use Ki ATM.
[1:08:49] <Applecannon63> I mean if Videl can learn how to fly and close attaining ki then why not Satan
[1:08:51] <BlackermanZX> didnt tien have like alien ancenstors or sumthin
[1:08:51] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs so weird Jiren is in this game
[1:08:54] <Aganok_> Satan would be the strongest human if it wasn't for all the humans stronger than him
[1:09:00] <Reckless_Rob> I mean even Videl can beat him
[1:09:01] <+HolyGriddles> Roshi was the strongest fighter in the world in the OG Dragon Ball
[1:09:01] <+krispen_wa> wasnt videl already way stronnger than satan
[1:09:04] <Shade075> Oh and Videl too
[1:09:18] <%IcedTorch> Satan is NOT a joke character, he is just fighting like satan would.
[1:09:19] <+HolyGriddles> He was like a retired master when we first met him
[1:09:22] <Reckless_Rob> Hahaha LUL thats amazing
[1:09:24] <+keliff> WOW
[1:09:24] <Daeron_red_fire> Satan is the strongest because he does not relay on cables and special effects
[1:09:26] <ozmon> I love to believe that if they met, Satan would fold Tao Pai Pai
[1:09:29] <%ggbhtg> MAXIMUM SATAN
[1:09:33] <+AlcesRex> Satan on that Diddy Kong shit lmao
[1:09:35] <Applecannon63> Satan is like a better Dan
[1:09:36] <Super_Voltekka> CONCRETE DONKEY STATUE FLASHBACKS NotLikeThis

[1:09:55] <jasonisgold79> Yeah this Hercule isn't a joke character like he is in most games. He's legit to my knowledge.
[1:09:59] <+keliff> all these animations are so nice
[1:10:01] <%ggbhtg> Satan WOULD timer scam
[1:10:06] <Reckless_Rob> The news appearently
[1:10:17] <BlackermanZX> satan has a hype mechanic in instinct mode
[1:10:19] <Aganok_> does "joke character" imply weakness? I'm not sure it does
[1:10:27] <%LordSDB> I remember that mermaid from DragonBall
[1:10:30] <%ggbhtg> yes it does
[1:10:32] <Super_Voltekka> Do Piccolo's Level 3
[1:10:32] <Theroyalrabite> Yould't Yajirobe be the strongest human that uses ki, he continued to train with the Zteam up til like the end of the saiyan arc
[1:10:34] <%ggbhtg> usually
[1:10:37] <ozmon> We all saw Vegito's joke power

[1:10:44] <Moffin23> Mr Satan just luring you into a false sense of securtity, he's the world champ after all, he'd never lose

[1:17:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> also this doing parsec again?
[1:17:34] <harlow777> when i came in here i thought woolie and reggie were sitting really close
[1:17:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> Full Foal
[1:17:42] <jasonisgold79> @Dean_Inbetween I mean if that's your opinion fine.
[1:17:45] <%JustToWatch> WAS
[1:17:47] <Shade075> @brachydios777 True
[1:17:49] <Moffin23> so are majin and baby vegeta rolled into one? or is this baby talk something else?
[1:17:53] <brachydios777> WAS
[1:17:54] <Samex_Comex> He's cool
[1:17:57] <BlackermanZX> Tien was a beast in DB and then it all went downhill
[1:17:58] <%Triforce505> wolf fang fist is fucking cool
[1:17:58] <+Chili_Daddy> UI Yamcha is real
[1:17:59] <%BarkerMugen> aw yeh Buu
[1:18:01] <Goosenip> I still think Yamcha is cool
[1:18:02] <StarlitStunner> bitterPun bitterPun
[1:18:05] <%Triforce505> spirit ball is fucking COOL
[1:18:11] <Dean_Inbetween> @jasonisgold79 referring to what?
[1:18:12] <%SableS139a> SourPls
[1:18:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Best thing about Yamcha is Wolf Fang Fist.
[1:18:15] <%gatorafan> I don't know who this Yamcha guy is, but he sounds disappointing Kappa
[1:18:16] <+JaseAdrift> Every OG db character just disappears unless they are goku
[1:18:18] <Applecannon63> The anime currently hates Tieb
[1:18:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Majin Booberry colors? okayyy
[1:18:23] <KgKid51> buus animations are wild
[1:18:28] <Goosenip> You guys remember Launch?
[1:18:36] <BlackermanZX> Literally the only win Tien had in Z was vs a saibamen
[1:18:37] <Daeron_red_fire> I do
[1:18:40] <+JaseAdrift> This game remembers lauch
[1:18:42] <Moffin23> the show sure doesn't
[1:18:42] <+hakma> @Goosenip Who?
[1:18:44] <+JaseAdrift> launch
[1:18:44] <%Jetzord> @AlteisenReiseZ I think you mean the worst thing about Wolf Fang Fist is Yamcha
[1:18:48] <Shade075> Yamcha is still the canonical best baseball player in 2 universes tho
[1:18:51] <%SableS139a> @Goosenip Yep. But then again, I grew up more with Dragon Ball Classic than I did with Z.
[1:18:56] <Applecannon63> @blackermanzx you forget vs Cell
[1:18:59] <+VantaLow> Bulma?
[1:19:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Jetzord LUL
[1:19:08] <%IcedTorch> Use buu to turn tien into CANDY!!!
[1:19:09] <Super_Voltekka> One of Buu's specials is literally named Gackt LUL
[1:19:12] <Reckless_Rob> crap I missed the Krill
[1:19:16] <%gatorafan> @shade075, Yamcha would defeat Jiren on Baseball
[1:19:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:19:16] <Applecannon63> his Shin Kik≈çho
[1:19:20] <BlackermanZX> Tien only bought time against cell LUL he didnt even damage him
[1:19:22] <%ggbhtg> Chat did you know Toriyama forgot about Launch?????? I bet you didn't. Nobody but me knows. :)
[1:19:32] <jasonisgold79> @Dean_Inbetween Nothing. Just saying that's your opinion. Ain't nothing wrong with it.

[1:21:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! aye, 26 months, glad to still be dropping by and dropping combos

[1:21:12] <BlackermanZX> another fetish for the lore?
[1:21:14] <%Asuterisuku> Buu has anatomy?
[1:21:15] <brachydios777> He‚Äôs goo
[1:21:15] <nailwind> see, this is why I said he's the coolest
[1:21:16] <%ottermusprime21> @gustavozxd mah , reggie's the foot guy
[1:21:16] <Dean_Inbetween> PAT?
[1:21:19] <KetsuoTaberu> man I love Reggie
[1:21:20] <jasonisgold79> @Dean_Inbetween You were saying Baby is the only good GT character. Which if that's your opinion fine. I politely disagree. I was just saying that if that's your opinion then that's your opinion.
[1:21:21] <lyriuswolf> Reggie thats a South Park episode
[1:21:21] <Moffin23> so its this and Feet then?
[1:21:22] <+JaseAdrift> buu is a walking piece of gum
[1:21:22] <Reckless_Rob> Buu IS poo
[1:21:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> every now and then reggie removes the limiter, seemingly just to remind us that he can
[1:21:24] <300coolfactsaboutbears> life finds a way
[1:21:26] <+Chili_Daddy> human curiosity has gone too far
[1:21:28] <OninKHd> do they know how to install with the characters?
[1:21:37] <%LordSDB> We have CSB for that psaWhat
[1:21:39] <%ggbhtg> yes
[1:21:39] <%eriksdrums> They rejected his message because he told them the truth
[1:21:40] <+keliff> haha
[1:21:45] <SoromopsDucky> ZWANG
[1:21:46] <+hakma> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ He's slowly filling up his instinct meter...
[1:21:47] <+Xero_J> ZWANG
[1:21:47] <Dean_Inbetween> @jasonisgold79 oh okay then please tell me what your favorite gt character is
[1:21:47] <+Superbro64> once you like feet you like anything huh?
[1:21:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> ZWANG LUL
[1:21:53] <%ggbhtg> Captain...SWORRRRRDO
[1:21:57] <Dean_Inbetween> @jasonisgold79 im curious
[1:22:03] <+SaurianCrash> i like the jp spelling of Baby , Babi
[1:22:04] <KgKid51> Super buu the best buu no cap
[1:22:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> Feet are a gateway kink i know this now
[1:22:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Get ready for POSES
[1:22:14] <+Chili_Daddy> ssj goku is insane
[1:22:19] <%SableS139a> YEAH! HYPER DRAGON BALL Z!!!
[1:22:30] <GMKGoat> Dab stance
[1:22:31] <Applecannon63> Gotenks the walking 4th wall breaker
[1:22:43] <nailwind> never bet saiyans on saltybet
[1:22:44] <Daeron_red_fire> Gotenks its the memer
[1:22:49] <+Chili_Daddy> gotenks is the dbz fandom with all af shit in a nutshell lmao
[1:22:56] <+Superbro64> gotenks is possibly the most complex character in the game
[1:23:00] <%HajimeNoStream> gotenks broke the 4th wall?
[1:23:06] <Applecannon63> Gotenks this games Deadpool
[1:23:11] <Dean_Inbetween> Gotenks aka kiddie dead pool
[1:23:12] <%chosenjuan42> Half hour dad
[1:23:14] <%Asuterisuku> Oh hey, this is Goku's farm.
[1:23:14] <%ggbhtg> Pose charges his Instinct meter LUL @woolieversus
[1:23:16] <+Xero_J> He IS your dad...sort of
[1:23:23] <jasonisgold79> @Dean_Inbetween In terms of design, Super 17 is cool. In terms of lore, Shadow Dragons are alright.
[1:23:24] <+TenKaiHunter> look at the detail of the wakeup. Amazing
[1:23:25] <%IcedTorch> Summon the bros with gotenks for a better moveset
[1:23:27] <+JaseAdrift> Trunk said that
[1:23:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Superbro64
[1:23:40] <KetsuoTaberu> I ain't fraid of no ghosts
[1:23:50] <jasonisgold79> Basica Bitch answer I know. But I honestly don't care.
[1:23:51] <Theroyalrabite> but what about exploding ghosts
[1:23:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> They go on commands
[1:23:58] <+keliff> yea i didn't expect them to stay
[1:23:59] <Daeron_red_fire> gotta use them with commands
[1:23:59] <%IcedTorch> any move gotenks has with PUNCH can be done with KICK to have the ghosts do it, spending the ghost.
[1:23:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Charge
[1:24:14] <Dean_Inbetween> @jasonisgold79 completely true I dont disagree, i also love the themes behind the shadow dragons
[1:24:24] <%IcedTorch> sssj goku speciality is teleporting around
[1:24:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> I might like this Gotenks more than DBF's and I'm just watching ü•¥
[1:24:24] <BlackermanZX> check the gotenks movelist for the ghosts
[1:24:25] <Moffin23> so would Gogeta be gotenk's dad then?
[1:24:28] <Shade075> Are the ghost like eggs in Yoshi games?
[1:24:28] <%Triforce505> yall got to get on them installs
[1:24:29] <KetsuoTaberu> KRAK
[1:24:31] <nailwind> KRAK
[1:24:32] <SpookyMooks> destroy the child
[1:24:36] <%ggbhtg> K R A K
[1:24:36] <+SaurianCrash> i still wonder if Gotenks moves in the series are real
[1:24:41] <%ggbhtg> Sooo, posing charges his Instinct meter LUL @woolieversus
[1:24:42] <PhDream> Every character has an install.
[1:24:44] <%Zero_Jacks> lytKILLGOKU Dunk the Goku wait. im not in this game..
[1:24:45] <Mr_Rakjo> Everyone has the Installs @WoolieVersus
[1:24:45] <BlackermanZX> every character has an instinct
[1:24:48] <hadoking2> They all have them. They cost 2 bars
[1:24:48] <Samex_Comex> You need level 2 meter to activate
[1:24:53] <+JaseAdrift> Every character has Install
[1:24:55] <SocialMisfitGamer> you need two bars of meter
[1:24:55] <+Chili_Daddy> you need lvl2 for install
[1:25:00] <%IcedTorch> you need 2 bars before using the installs, you are not gathering enough energy :)
[1:25:21] <BlackermanZX> also Babidi is weird af
[1:25:26] <BlackermanZX> hes like a boss character
[1:25:31] <+keliff> oh word?
[1:25:33] <Shade075> LUL
[1:25:42] <entransta> Babidi is a weird boss puppet character
[1:25:46] <jasonisgold79> @Dean_Inbetween Like the idea is cool. The thing that's always saved the main casts asses are now destroying their world. Like that's cool. Just saying, GT isn't as bad as some people say. I mean heck I find it Ironic that more people are saying that NOW after Super came out.
[1:25:48] <+JaseAdrift> Our og Dragon ball Rep
[1:25:49] <%SableS139a> "Bark bark, bro"
[1:25:50] <Furbylon> dbfz your move
[1:25:50] <%Asuterisuku> And yet only one of them ever returned.
[1:25:52] <+Xero_J> He doesn't get the full size mech?
[1:25:53] <nailwind> ok, pilaf gang is amazing
[1:25:56] <powerprotoman> pilafs not complete yet so its fine your fighting babadi
[1:26:02] <emeraldskrull> i can't even imagine someone liking babidi
[1:26:02] <supereyepatchwolf> god damn weeb shit
[1:26:15] <Theroyalrabite> your best jump in option with pilaf is j.HP
[1:26:15] <Aganok_> I love Babidi's moveset
[1:26:15] <nailwind> babidi the ballsack
[1:26:17] <%ggbhtg> @supereyepatchwolf woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[1:26:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:19] <Rykorr> my bf mains babidi whenever we play this lmao
[1:26:20] <GMKGoat> Never getting Pilaf in DBFZ
[1:26:24] <powerprotoman> so whens garlic Jr
[1:26:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> wait, which version is this?
[1:26:33] <UnknownMortis> they need to charge more
[1:26:40] <KgKid51> can't wait till pilaf gang is finished
[1:26:45] <+SaurianCrash> i liked Ledgek or who ever goku had to go super against gt the first time
[1:26:51] <+HolyGriddles> I miss adult Mai from og DB
[1:26:51] <%Asuterisuku> Reggie with his full stick up butter.
[1:27:01] <%ggbhtg> No time to charge, too busy playing this like a regular fighting game LUL
[1:27:04] <+ArcanumArcanum> @jasonisgold79 GT has cool ideas executed very poorly. Its good arcs are the later ones that most people didn't get to because they stopped watching when the series is awful
[1:27:06] <%Jetzord> @CaptainPileDriver I think it's the newest one
[1:27:13] <Dean_Inbetween> @jasonisgold79 no i dont think gt is bad I think it was more of a case of bad pacing and timing after a series that was already being burnt out by the buu saga, gt is more so a victim of timing where as super came out after a series hiatus so yeah your right
[1:27:18] <+keliff> LMAO what a good charge
[1:27:21] <nailwind> that is so good
[1:27:25] <%SableS139a> K E K
[1:27:32] <jasonisgold79> I mean heck the same way about Super too. It's not perfect, but it's not the worst thing in the series. I just wish people would stop treating it like that, ya know?
[1:27:38] <+SaurianCrash> i watched gt from start to end in jp raw no sub
[1:27:42] <DreamOfFrogs> So weird, haven't thought or been interested in dragon ball since the fighter z release, but I'm watching this and I can't stop smiling. def brings out the nostalgia man
[1:27:48] <+redyoshi5> pilaf gang and babidi are the only characters with now install
[1:27:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pilaf doesn't have install yet
[1:27:56] <DreamOfFrogs> lol "help!"
[1:28:00] <+redyoshi5> no install
[1:28:03] <Theroyalrabite> vegetto also doesn't have an install
[1:28:10] <Aganok_> honestly, Dragon Ball as a whole is very old and has very little space to grow
[1:28:10] <+redyoshi5> right
[1:28:12] <jasonisgold79> Point is, bad execution, does not necessarily equal bad ideas. I wish more people and companies would see that.
[1:28:14] <%IcedTorch> use pilaf calamity lv3! qcf qcf kick for his final attack!!!
[1:28:14] <nailwind> BOUNCE ON EM
[1:28:24] <Applecannon63> super had 3 bad arcs but the finale had the best moment/
[1:28:27] <%ggbhtg> They both picked one of the few characters with no install after learning how to, RIP
[1:28:29] <brachydios777> I just realized Beborah is naned after Abra Kedabra
[1:28:37] <Samex_Comex> He dose have a lvl3 with kick
[1:28:42] <Shade075> Its funny how if Goku never landed on Earth, Pilaf would've ended up ruling Earth until Buu came.
[1:28:43] <brachydios777> *Deborah
[1:28:54] <%SableS139a> GIVE ME YOUR WALLET
[1:28:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> how do you do install
[1:29:04] <Shade075> Like thats a long ass time
[1:29:06] <BlackermanZX> i think pilaf and babidi dont have installs yet
[1:29:18] <jasonisgold79> Back when the series was a Gag Manga.
[1:29:19] <%ggbhtg> They BOTH didn't have Instinct modes so RIP LUL @woolieversus
[1:29:24] <Daeron_red_fire> to hard to animate those dots
[1:29:25] <jasonisgold79> Yet....;)
[1:29:25] <Dean_Inbetween> @jasonisgold79 the right time and the right man in the right place can make all the difference Dr Freeman :v
[1:29:25] <Aganok_> I think it's 22 MP+MK @CaptainPileDriver
[1:29:28] <%IcedTorch> no unlockables, we just havent done cell yet, chars take a long ass time
[1:29:28] <Iwashi94> Toriyama's monster/fantasy designs are way better than his DBZ stuff imo
[1:29:29] <darkfox1995> Too hard to animate Kappa
[1:29:29] <KgKid51> cell is in development I think
[1:29:29] <brunoberserk> not yet
[1:29:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> ok
[1:29:33] <%BarkerMugen> no cell yet. workin on it...
[1:29:35] <Moffin23> I don't mind the whole evil dragon ball things, even if some of those designs aren't all that hot
[1:29:36] <+JaseAdrift> DRAGON BALL IS REALLY COOL
[1:29:36] <Applecannon63> not yet
[1:29:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay i'm legit interested in what they do with jiren
[1:29:42] <%Asuterisuku> No Hit though?
[1:29:43] <Daeron_red_fire> Launch is also in development
[1:29:43] <nailwind> can't wait for Black
[1:29:45] <+Chili_Daddy> cannot wait for cell
[1:29:49] <Pyrrhus90> OG Dragon Ball <3
[1:29:50] <BlackermanZX> SSJ Vegeta is a mishima
[1:29:54] <platformerkar64> Cells on hold right now since the spriter is doing Goku Black currently, but he's also busy with real life work
[1:29:54] <Theroyalrabite> This build is like, 10+ years of total work
[1:29:56] <+Superbro64> @barkermugen yooo BARKER! nice to see ya
[1:29:56] <Moffin23> don't mind Omega Shenron and what not
[1:29:58] <%IcedTorch> theres a trailer out for jiren if you guys are curious on what he has
[1:29:58] <+Xero_J> How would you do unlockable chars in MUGEN, anyway?
[1:30:02] <%Jetzord> @CaptainPileDriver and all the characters charge up their bars differently
[1:30:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:30:07] <+ArcanumArcanum> was that a fucking yoshi?
[1:30:09] <brunoberserk> ssj vegeta has mishima inputs
[1:30:11] <+gustavozxd> Koopa
[1:30:15] <%Asuterisuku> >Koopa Troopa in Freiza's crew.
[1:30:16] <brachydios777> Black is awesome and I don‚Äôt care what anyone says
[1:30:18] <SinisterBroccoli> wasn't there the Bazz there?
[1:30:24] <Samex_Comex> Happy 2014

[1:33:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1351446630420148224
[1:33:24] <jasonisgold79> We can we all agree that Blue Veggies Full Final Flash in FighterZ....is fucking awesome. Like I really love it from a visual stand point.
[1:33:24] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Blu charges up like Guilty Gear Tension
[1:33:49] <SocialMisfitGamer> @WoolieVersus Vegeta gauge's is based on momentum. The more you move foward, the higher it builds
[1:33:50] <jasonisgold79> Blue Evolution!
[1:33:53] <Samex_Comex> Minty sayian!
[1:33:56] <Shade075> YOOOOO is that blue evo?!
[1:34:03] <+Xero_J> Royal Blue
[1:34:03] <jasonisgold79> I think so.
[1:34:03] <%SableS139a> Vegeta Blue rewards you for being an aggressive asshole, but get knocked down or retreat and your meter goes down.
[1:34:04] <Theroyalrabite> That is indeed blue evo
[1:34:04] <Aganok_> SSB evolved is so hype in this
[1:34:11] <platformerkar64> @Shade075 Yep!
[1:34:12] <%IcedTorch> VEGETA has a hidden move fowrad lp mp sp forward with 3 bars that woolie should try out
[1:34:24] <%IcedTorch> its called BINGO
[1:34:26] <Shade075> @platformerkar64 HYPE
[1:34:27] <saiyanblitz> I like to call it Royal Blue cause Evolution sounds so meh
[1:34:37] <SocialMisfitGamer> lets see if he can find the neo deadly rave
[1:34:38] <Theroyalrabite> bingo time is best time
[1:34:44] <brachydios777> Ssb evolution is basically Super Vegeta Blue
[1:34:47] <+kennneh> Vegeta has wavedash
[1:34:48] <platformerkar64> @saiyanblitz I kinda like that
[1:34:49] <Reckless_Rob> @icedtorch Oh god
[1:34:49] <+Personified134> THE THUMB POINT
[1:34:49] <+Masamune195> are the characters all fair in this or is it one of those "ssblue should beat everyone so he has the OP moves"
[1:34:50] <+jbaker009> beyond blue is the coolest name
[1:35:05] <Samex_Comex> Even bluer
[1:35:12] <platformerkar64> I appreciate people who appreciate the lip sync in this game
[1:35:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Get stronger!! Get madder! Yes!" He's just like me
[1:35:13] <%SableS139a> @Masamune195 The former. Well, save for Babidi. Babidi's just ass.
[1:35:13] <%IcedTorch> No secret characters, there are arcade mode mini games.
[1:35:15] <+Superbro64> Do the ui super and then you open it up I suppose
[1:35:19] <Aganok_> @Masamune195 mostly balanced between all characters
[1:35:23] <TheactualDiepod> I think its hidden boxes
[1:35:25] <Theroyalrabite> Everyone is balanced, you can kick a bougeta's butt with pilaf, if you have the skill
[1:35:26] <DaBigVitus> oh wow is this game completed now?
[1:35:27] <+jbaker009> Super goku, Majin vegeta, and 18 best characters
[1:35:29] <%IcedTorch> Sup im one of the devs.
[1:35:30] <DingusMcBaseball> just move beyond the boxes
[1:35:32] <+Masamune195> cool, cool
[1:35:33] <%ggbhtg> Pilaf gang was off screen in a previous version @woolieversus
[1:35:33] <Theroyalrabite> bluegeta*
[1:35:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo devs in chat
[1:35:46] <Theroyalrabite> Iced is a dev
[1:35:52] <+Superbro64> co op in arcade mode? @woolieversus
[1:35:56] <%eriksdrums> Smash has got a LOT of secret characters
[1:35:57] <jasonisgold79> @saiyanblitz It reminds you of...THAT movie, doesn't it? It's fine, Royal Blue does sound cooler. And more fitting.
[1:35:59] <Aganok_> @DaBigVitus Goku Black, Jiren and maybe Cell might happen in the future still
[1:36:07] <Reckless_Rob> Stage 36???
[1:36:08] <+Xero_J> *Writes that down*
[1:36:09] <platformerkar64> YOOO LUIGI OUTFIT POG
[1:36:10] <SocialMisfitGamer> @IcedTorch I remember there was a Golden Frieza variant. Is that still there, or not?
[1:36:11] <DaBigVitus> cool, cool.
[1:36:14] <+SaurianCrash> you can select them if you know where to look
[1:36:24] <+Superbro64> luigi stan 18 LUL
[1:36:31] <Theroyalrabite> It's a palette option MisfitG
[1:36:32] <Applecannon63> Spousel domestics fights
[1:36:37] <%IcedTorch> @SocialMisfitGamer tjhe gold freeza variant is the arcade mode boss, its just a cheaper freeza that teleports away if you combo him for too long, its not human controllable
[1:36:41] <+JaseAdrift> i hope they make Beerus a character love that cat god
[1:36:44] <Bevral> This isnt a fight, its foreplay
[1:36:50] <DreamOfFrogs> please think of the children!
[1:36:50] <Shade075> They should add movie Goku as a joke character, make him terrible
[1:36:58] <%gatorafan> Is this fightfuck or fuckfight?
[1:37:01] <Aganok_> Beerus in a game with actual setplay would be fire
[1:37:01] <+Superbro64> Is this the ssj3 charge up music??
[1:37:02] <GMKGoat> Oh man a couple fight
[1:37:03] <+Superbro64> nice
[1:37:04] <Moffin23> oh hey that is the super sayain 3 them in the background there
[1:37:09] <+SaurianCrash> they have his palette tho
[1:37:22] <%SableS139a> @Bevral Fighting before fucking as foreplay? Well, I've heard of stranger.
[1:37:22] <platformerkar64> Krillin's mah boi in this game, he's so cool, devs did him justice!
[1:37:23] <GMKGoat> Step on me 18
[1:37:26] <Daeron_red_fire> its for reposition
[1:37:30] <saiyanblitz> @jasonisgold79 it‚Äôs not because of that movie it more of evolution isn‚Äôt really a fitting thing for vegeta to call it I think with him being a prince and all he should‚Äôve have it as Royal Blue due as a thing of heritage
[1:37:30] <%Irridium> god I wish that were me
[1:37:33] <%Asuterisuku> This matchup: Imminent divorce?
[1:37:38] <%Triforce505> damn, Krillin looks so sick
[1:37:43] <+Xero_J> When did Krillin learn the kaioken?
[1:37:51] <Bevral> Krillin got some sick moves
[1:37:56] <Kaji04> This match up: "Foreplay"
[1:38:00] <Shade075> Frost?!
[1:38:03] <%SableS139a> FROST, WHAT THE FUCK
[1:38:06] <+JaseAdrift> He doesnt know kaioken, its a translation thing
[1:38:08] <+Xero_J> Oh wait, TAIyoken, never mind
[1:38:08] <BlacSoul> kaioken is .... not great
[1:38:09] <entransta> @xero_j taiyoken. It's the original name for solar flare
[1:38:10] <Aganok_> @Xero_J iirc it's Taiyoken, it's Solar Flare
[1:38:10] <Applecannon63> oh god he has back kamehameha
[1:38:15] <%ggbhtg> REMEMBER TO GET YOUR PARSECS READY CHAT
[1:38:34] <BlacSoul> *taioken
[1:38:46] <Miles_Stardiver> Wish I had joined this stream from this start. This looks fucking amazing
[1:38:49] <TheactualDiepod> parsec on mugen huh? good luck
[1:38:56] <Theroyalrabite> The combos get really rad, and for all the advanced players, HDBZ is for all intentsd and purposes a 3 touch game
[1:38:58] <+SaurianCrash> ?
[1:39:04] <%ggbhtg> Good luck indeed
[1:39:05] <Applecannon63> Krillin doing that Roshi shit
[1:39:08] <platformerkar64> @ggbhtg Wait is he actually gonna start up Parsec!?!? Cuz I was about to ask him! PogChamp
[1:39:11] <+AlphaRayAllen> DOSU KOI
[1:39:27] <TheactualDiepod> I doubt it
[1:39:29] <+kennneh> Is 18 Bison?
[1:39:34] <thekrillmaster1> bruh these matches are pretty crazy xD
[1:39:36] <+SaurianCrash> i already played hdbz on parsec last week
[1:39:38] <%ggbhtg> usually playing online is a part of the program, people
[1:39:44] <%BarkerMugen> parsec looked fine on maxs stream, unless i missed something
[1:39:46] <%ggbhtg> will it WORK?
[1:39:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> how does 18's install work? Everytime you block ki attacks it raises the meter?
[1:39:52] <%ggbhtg> different story
[1:39:53] <+SaurianCrash> it does
[1:39:54] <Theroyalrabite> I dunno, but the players over here on the official server don't usually have too much trouble running parsec matches with HDBZ diepod
[1:39:55] <+LeaIsChill> Krillin is lit in this and FighterZ
[1:39:56] <Daeron_red_fire> scdatter shot
[1:39:57] <glaciusinfinite> blazingsunblazingsublazingsun
[1:40:05] <%IcedTorch> Krillin has a bunch of feints if you use taunt in the comamnds
[1:40:14] <+AlphaRayAllen> How many gokus in this game?
[1:40:18] <+SaurianCrash> 2
[1:40:19] <+JaseAdrift> 2
[1:40:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> Dos
[1:40:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:40:29] <+awesomeguy423> more vegetas than gokus
[1:40:33] <Aganok_> 3 vegetas and 2 Gokus
[1:40:34] <+JaseAdrift> 3 vegetas
[1:40:34] <Reckless_Rob> 3 Vegeets?
[1:40:35] <%Asuterisuku> Hey remember when Arc said that FighterZ WASN'T going to be Oops All Goku?
[1:40:37] <BlackermanZX> 2 and a half gokus
[1:40:38] <Samex_Comex> He has a blanka duck
[1:40:43] <+LeaIsChill> More Vegetas then Gokus is PogChamp ngl
[1:40:50] <jasonisgold79> @AlphaRayAllen Just Two, three if we count Blue. For now, anyways.
[1:40:52] <%ggbhtg> so why would Parsec not work? they've done it for 8+ other games @theactualdiepod
[1:40:56] <+Xero_J> I'm a Rocket Man...
[1:40:58] <+LeaIsChill> oh god Karen PogChamp
[1:40:58] <+kennneh> @Asuterisuku That was probably when they thought teh gaem was one getting a single season.
[1:41:01] <Aganok_> there's only 5 Gokus in over 40 characters, it's a good ratio
[1:41:02] <%IcedTorch> Parsec is how most people play on this.
[1:41:02] <+JaseAdrift> Parsec works for this game
[1:41:04] <platformerkar64> I love to hear the enjoyment for Krillin!
[1:41:13] <+phat_gio> yooooo this is sick atpGasm
[1:41:14] <Heefnoff> Holy shit they added a lot of characters since the last time I saw this
[1:41:17] <+awesomeguy423> luffy LUL
[1:41:21] <Daeron_red_fire> ohbug
[1:41:25] <%JustToWatch> guess Krillin is part of the 40% of cops that beat their spouses
[1:41:28] <+SaurianCrash> i played soul cal 6 on parsec
[1:41:43] <%BarkerMugen> yeah krillin deserves more credit. super fun
[1:41:43] <%Asuterisuku> @Aganok_ You have to count fusions as well though.
[1:41:43] <+awesomeguy423> YO USE IKEMEN
[1:41:48] <TreeLeafBoi> woah krillin
[1:41:51] <Aganok_> no I don't LUL
[1:41:51] <+Xero_J> @justtowatch to be fair, his spouse beats back
[1:41:53] <Theroyalrabite> we used to all use ikemen, but with parsec it's all so much easier
[1:41:53] <+awesomeguy423> IKEMEN, NOT PASEC FOR MUGEN
[1:42:00] <TheactualDiepod> Parsec on mugen is weird, because mugen might not recognize the other players controller unless its there first, which mean they probably want to share the pc instead of the game in particular
[1:42:04] <Daeron_red_fire> @BarkerMugen Hello there!
[1:42:09] <platformerkar64> These are 2 of some of my favorite characters in this game, I love Kril and Base Vegeta a LOT!
[1:42:11] <+awesomeguy423> like i said man, Ikemen @TheactualDiepod
[1:42:23] <Theroyalrabite> no yeah, we help a lot of players naviagate that exact issue diepod
[1:42:27] <+awesomeguy423> so was Vegeta's armor really just a community thing?
[1:42:28] <RyuuAoi> Haha Woolie should really be right tho...
[1:42:33] <%BarkerMugen> hey @Daeron_red_fire :)
[1:42:38] <Theroyalrabite> It happens like everytime for new players
[1:42:44] <GMKGoat> That super is sick
[1:42:45] <TheactualDiepod> @awesomeguy423 well this game isnt ikemen
[1:42:46] <BlackermanZX> That was sick
[1:42:47] <Bevral> sick
[1:42:49] <%Irridium> PogChamp
[1:42:49] <+Chazmosis> That was RAD
[1:42:55] <%BarkerMugen> lots of familiar names in here
[1:42:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> YESSIR KURIRIN SUPREMACY
[1:42:57] <+awesomeguy423> @TheactualDiepod but you can just put the characters into ikemen
[1:42:58] <SpookyMooks> break de eart
[1:42:58] <%SableS139a> THE SAUCE
[1:42:59] <%ggbhtg> jaboodyCool jaboodyCool jaboodyCool
[1:43:00] <crazzmatazz2> siiiick
[1:43:07] <crazzmatazz2> krillins finally out huh
[1:43:09] <saiyanblitz> Was that Krillin Raging Demon
[1:43:11] <TheactualDiepod> @Theroyalrabite ah rad
[1:43:11] <+Xero_J> Dang, boy, where was that during the Cell saga?
[1:43:14] <jasonisgold79> Plus they all function differently. So chill out. I get wanting different characters and stuff. But so long as they bring something diffrent to the table even if it's same model or similar moves, it's fine imo. Plus it's kind of hard when said character is popular and involved in a lot of stuff in the series.
[1:43:20] <dundunsun> üç§
[1:43:26] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> Raging Krillin demon
[1:43:34] <jasonisgold79> Besides we got different unqiue characters in the end.
[1:43:35] <%ggbhtg> @xero_j not mattering, because power levels
[1:43:40] <+awesomeguy423> I don't appreciate them selling the same model for the same price @jasonisgold79
[1:43:42] <fightiningspirit> can you guys pls use ssj goku go blue and and do lv3 with opponent at low health pls
[1:43:46] <TheactualDiepod> @awesomeguy423 Woolie isnt trying to do that kind of set up trust me
[1:43:54] <Daeron_red_fire> you can make baits with krillin with commands + taunt
[1:43:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> vegeta got cake
[1:44:01] <+awesomeguy423> oh def, I dont think woolie could figure it out LUL
[1:44:02] <%ggbhtg> @fightiningspirit and do your taxes?
[1:44:37] <Daeron_red_fire> Orin combo
[1:44:45] <%LordSDB> LUL
[1:44:45] <ShinMaddrox> That little jig he did
[1:44:46] <jasonisgold79> @awesomeguy423 Well that's more arguing about game development and practices, and company stuff in general. In terms of actual gameplay, I think it turned out alright.
[1:44:51] <TheactualDiepod> I didnt say all that
[1:45:00] <jasonisgold79> Now the real BS is with the Anime Music packs.
[1:45:04] <crazzmatazz2> whoaaaa
[1:45:08] <crazzmatazz2> what a taunt
[1:45:17] <+SaurianCrash> i wish you could name the game so parsec with change its name on the arcade
[1:45:39] <crazzmatazz2> krillins been watching one punch man
[1:45:42] <%BarkerMugen> is this stage still laggin?

[1:48:32] <jasonisgold79> Though if we get a Big Band-esk moment again, that would be amazing.
[1:48:33] <crazzmatazz2> mods on mods on mods
[1:48:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's cool
[1:48:50] <%ggbhtg> If I need to jump in JUST to make sure the configs work, that's all I'm doing. I haven't touched this game once.
[1:48:52] <@Menitta> What a good name
[1:48:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> i was connected but the thing wouldn't let me move
[1:48:59] <TheactualDiepod> might need to be the same kind of controller?
[1:49:03] <nailwind> society and gamers
[1:49:07] <DingusMcBaseball> restart the game woolie
[1:49:09] <%Irridium> might be fucked
[1:49:09] <BlackermanZX> maybe restart
[1:49:11] <@Menitta> Apparently Mugen is weird with Parsec
[1:49:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> maybe just leave it plugged in
[1:49:15] <Theroyalrabite> I've seen it work with different controllers
[1:49:30] <Pookiedaexzile> The Truly most oppressed class
[1:49:34] <SocialMisfitGamer> It;s a no go for me
[1:49:35] <Pookiedaexzile> GAMERS
[1:49:36] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will figure it out
[1:49:45] <Pookiedaexzile> shout out SoBroNo3
[1:49:46] <+Basilias_Maximus> Might have to start the game after someone connects.
[1:49:47] <Samex_Comex> Leave it plugged in and restart the game
[1:49:48] <crazzmatazz2> where theres a WOOL theres a way
[1:49:48] <jasonisgold79> Like when I first saw that moment, it was already a 10/10. And then once I learned that particular taunt is a custom input, it made it an 100/10.
[1:49:50] <%Wool> Might have to redo player 2 controls each time
[1:49:54] <@Menitta> https://parsec.app/join/1kqg1jyMZxgFVbcW9eROpSy4YBs/c8a0bc56
[1:50:02] <DingusMcBaseball> you have to restart when another controller plugs in
[1:50:03] <Theroyalrabite> gotta redo player mapping everytime with parsec
[1:50:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> if that worse amazing
[1:50:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> *works
[1:50:18] <TheactualDiepod> Mugen tends to like the controller to be there before launching the game at all in my experience.
[1:50:58] <Theroyalrabite> that is totally correct woolie
[1:51:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> ye
[1:51:20] <%Wool> You might have to go to control config each time
[1:51:22] <SocialMisfitGamer> yeah
[1:51:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm using my ps4 pad
[1:51:26] <TheactualDiepod> maybe go to input config @WoolieVersus
[1:51:28] <+SaurianCrash> yeah i think i cant move it
[1:51:28] <SocialMisfitGamer> I'm using an arcade stick
[1:51:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Got my stick plugged in
[1:51:31] <SunsetJack> Don't they.habe.to enable.an option?
[1:51:34] <%blacksoap65> Sak pase!
[1:51:37] <Clundy> Time to wake up, Samurai Crash.
[1:51:47] <%IcedTorch> you dont need to config everytime, theres a save option there for it
[1:51:54] <%ggbhtg> I will jump in with my Hori as a test, but I'm not trying to play.
[1:51:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> well, scuf vantage 2 pad but it worked with naruto, mugen is just being mugen
[1:51:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> eh
[1:52:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's fine
[1:52:01] <%FrostedZaibatsu> I couldnt even use my stick with this game
[1:52:08] <SocialMisfitGamer> it's all good
[1:52:09] <Theroyalrabite> he will if he does it with different players over parsec Iced
[1:52:11] <%Wool> boy that jumpscared me lmao
[1:52:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Dang
[1:52:16] <SocialMisfitGamer> maybe
[1:52:22] <crimsonsaens> Lab characters instead?
[1:52:37] <+kennneh> YoVideoGames figured something out but it was cumbersome I think.
[1:52:42] <BlackermanZX> can you restart after they connect
[1:52:45] <+SaurianCrash> oh well
[1:52:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> damn
[1:53:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> No movement
[1:53:03] <%Wool> F
[1:53:03] <SocialMisfitGamer> sheesh
[1:53:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's mugen
[1:53:06] <%Jetzord> Well shit, RIP
[1:53:07] <jasonisgold79> Good try.

[1:53:17] <%BarkerMugen> ah wells
[1:53:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oof
[1:53:20] <%Jetzord> At least we tried
[1:53:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Lab the moves I guess?
[1:53:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's the attempt that matters
[1:53:32] <%ggbhtg> Welp, let's see some supers!
[1:53:34] <TheactualDiepod> I really think its an input config thing, but all in all its stressful
[1:53:35] <+Superbro64> ui goku super time then?
[1:53:38] <+SaurianCrash> have you tried it with another pc where you at ?
[1:53:38] <%Triforce505> im cool with the lab
[1:53:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> an attempt was made
[1:54:01] <+watchfragile> time for Hyper Dimension?
[1:54:03] <jasonisgold79> Maybe at some point we can take a look at the trailer for this build afterwards to see some of the stuff we missed?
[1:54:19] <jasonisgold79> Just an idea.
[1:54:22] <%IcedTorch> Theres a trailer for jiren and one for Goku black that would be very interesting for you guys to check out.
[1:54:24] <SunsetJack> Max had to reboot everytime someone connects.

[1:54:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:38] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If only there was like, some sort of mugen that had netplay enabled

[1:54:44] <+Superbro64> max got parsec working with the yovid crew
[1:54:45] <TheactualDiepod> hmmm
[1:55:15] <%IcedTorch> The game isnt natively designed for team mode, so the cooler cinematics wont work on that mode. Aight? Also there might be bugs involving any form of throws or anything like that.
[1:55:22] <%IcedTorch> team mode is always a bit jank
[1:55:28] <Theroyalrabite> all the modes aside from training and versus and arcade may be a lil buggy, mind (this includes the co-op modes)
[1:55:34] <+alphaprotoshow> Dramatic Battle

[2:02:45] <Daeron_red_fire> the sayans got beat by the bases
[2:02:49] <Aganok_> the jank can only add to the hype
[2:02:53] <+alphaprotoshow> That looked pretty fun
[2:03:02] <BlackermanZX> Candy vegito and pilaf woolieMIRIN
[2:03:57] <agustorm123> is a calculator
[2:03:59] <Aganok_> damn, every character has a custom animation to getting hit by Satan
[2:04:18] <%IcedTorch> Tons of specific animations around
[2:04:39] <%IcedTorch> but yeah bugs gonna be plenty in team mode my dudes. we coded it for 1v1 so cinematic stuff will get janky
[2:04:45] <DreamOfFrogs> The Mugen AI was the real EVO champions all along
[2:04:50] <+lumporr> wait wtf is hercule doing here
[2:04:50] <%IcedTorch> and ofcourse balance is directed at 1v1, but its still fun to play team
[2:04:53] <+Grim1952> Slap that kid

[2:06:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> LETS GOOOO
[2:06:06] <%Gamefriendly> SICK
[2:06:07] <%IcedTorch> no my man we are focusing on canon stuff, most "non canon" stuff you would see would be stuff like Arale.
[2:06:12] <platformerkar64> TAHT WAS SICK TEAM COMBO
[2:06:22] <%Gamefriendly> its all about the WOMBOS baby, you gotta go for them
[2:06:26] <Aganok_> @lumporr it's the 2v2 mode for Mugen, I think it's native to the engine
[2:06:27] <+Grim1952> Does this have Z Broly?
[2:06:36] <GMKGoat> Ton of bar for blocking that kamehameha
[2:06:59] <+lumporr> @Aganok_ holy shit so it's
[2:07:05] <+lumporr> @Aganok_ just a 2v2?
[2:07:12] <Aganok_> nah, the main mode is 1v1
[2:07:19] <Aganok_> the 2v2 is for shits and giggles
[2:07:20] <GMKGoat> Oof
[2:07:21] <+lumporr> gotcha
[2:07:21] <%eriksdrums> Did uncle PHil just call for Lucille?
[2:07:23] <@Menitta> Mugen has a 2v2 mode
[2:07:24] <+lumporr> clearly
[2:07:26] <+lumporr> wowza
[2:07:31] <JetpackMcQuack> see the code
[2:07:46] <Theroyalrabite> At least as of current, Broly isn't made and isn't in progress, but who knows what the future will hold
[2:07:50] <+HolyGriddles> Bulma‚Äôs revenge
[2:07:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Be the bread
[2:08:06] <+Grim1952> Shame, Broly is so cool...
[2:08:12] <Aganok_> CPU coordination off the charts

[2:08:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:08:45] <%IcedTorch> The game is never balanced on team mode, so this kind of stuff happens =P it was designed more for 1v1, also look out for bugs and jank because the cinematic stuff is bound to break.

[2:37:06] <%Gamefriendly> oh my god is that longest super ever?
[2:37:08] <%ChoculaUltra> dramatic finish!
[2:37:09] <striderzer0> I have seen people use parsec to play online
[2:37:09] <+Xero_J> All that for only HALF a bar?
[2:37:09] <Estuko> the biggest smile on my face from seeing that
[2:37:10] <jasonisgold79> Awesome! That's sick!
[2:37:11] <+keliff> fucking dope
[2:37:12] <+kenyr> the flex!!!!!!!!!!
[2:37:12] <%Jetzord> YEYEEYEYEYEYE KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:37:13] <Mr_Rakjo> The Majin Buu lvl 3 is AWESOME
[2:37:16] <%HajimeNoStream> HajimeNoStream subscribed with Prime.
[2:37:16] <GMKGoat> Best fuckin DBZ game ever made???
[2:37:16] <BlackermanZX> So damn sick
[2:37:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> granted that was some strong strobe effects
[2:37:17] <+lumporr> all that for a drop of blood
[2:37:17] <%gatorafan> That was like 5 episodes
[2:37:17] <+Chili_Daddy> They're all amazing
[2:37:17] <%DashXero> Jesus.
[2:37:19] <+krispen_wa> FighterZ quality
[2:37:22] <mudapersona> DO GOTENKS FOR MEME
[2:37:23] <+Ancopro> Dramatic Finish!
[2:37:25] <Renkage> @WoolieVersus It even has a unique win scree
[2:37:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> OH?
[2:37:26] <%HajimeNoStream> 2dop[e
[2:37:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:37:32] <Renkage> *screen
[2:37:34] <%IcedTorch> The finisher moves are like super duper taunts, because you are never using them on actual gameplay, but if you do use them, you are styling completely on everyone
[2:37:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> mmmmm i can't wait for dbfz day
[2:37:52] <%SirGO0SE> super is so the bad but also so the best
[2:38:01] <Theroyalrabite> You say that Iced, but I get bodied hard enough in a lot of my matches that someplayers get them off
[2:38:02] <+krispen_wa> THE HYPEST KAMEHAMEHA
[2:38:04] <Jrocy247> Too bad Ultra Instinct Goku has such a basic as fuck design change
[2:38:16] <+Superbro64> UI Goku is apparently officially known as a "technique" not a "transformation" per Toei @woolieversus
[2:38:19] <+lumporr> if you push your gun towards the enemy as you shoot, the bullet goes faster
[2:38:21] <Aganok_> yeah, the Ultra Instinct is an amazing concept for the standards of DBZ
[2:38:23] <@Menitta> DB Super is a really fun watch
[2:38:24] <+Superbro64> so not a ssj transformation
[2:38:25] <%Juriasu> so glad they made that into a dramatic finish in dbfz
[2:38:26] <+krispen_wa> Too bad completed ultra instinct loses some of that style
[2:38:30] <%IcedTorch> Try out Gotenks.
[2:38:38] <@Menitta> https://network.mugenguild.com/balthazar/hyperdbz/ Here's the download again
[2:38:46] <striderzer0> thats what that super seem to be referencing with the triple kamehameha
[2:38:54] <chll0ne> ultra instinct 2 looks whack
[2:38:57] <%SirGO0SE> @Menitta it still feels too good to be true. that they ignore GT, that it even exists in the first place. its a gift
[2:39:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> mmmm
[2:39:12] <@Menitta> Yeah that's even crazy
[2:39:21] <Jrocy247> I MEAN.....
[2:39:26] <%IcedTorch> Barker sprited buu
[2:39:28] <%HajimeNoStream> gg's

[2:40:28] <jasonisgold79> To be fair DBFZ has a more broad appeal given that most of it's commands for stuff is mostly just Quarter Circle and then some buttons.

[2:43:56] <jasonisgold79> Meh, I'll pass. Sorry, but based off what I've seen/heard so far. CSB doesn't seem like my thing. Like I don't know, just bit too cynical at times for my taste. Looking forward to more Yakuza though.
