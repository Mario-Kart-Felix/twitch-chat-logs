[0:20:30] <%X2Eliah> Is EVO fixed or is it still a shitshow?
[0:20:33] <leith_aziz> I watched it after it was done because of different time regions
[0:20:34] <HollowMan190> wait Evo started?
[0:20:39] <locobo98> evo is over
[0:20:44] <leith_aziz> Guys, EVO was 2 days sgo
[0:20:46] <locobo98> forever
[0:20:51] <%krispen_wa> i cant believe Better Woolie managed to say the words "submissive and breedable" on live tv
[0:20:57] <locobo98> no more evo, only dreams
[0:21:04] <dds333a> @krispen_wa as he is prone to do
[0:21:09] <faldin> is the audio out of sync?
[0:21:17] <%X2Eliah> @krispen_wa I can't believe fucking Vince McMahon isn'y using such talent properly
[0:21:18] <leith_aziz> seems in sync
[0:21:18] <+RigmaroleHM> Not for me
[0:21:20] <@Solidus_113> air tatami

[0:22:16] <leith_aziz> I find it weird how the trailer started with her eye and arm mirrored
[0:22:19] <dds333a> the handicap makes it ok Kappa
[0:22:28] <%krispen_wa> If Baiken is in SamSho, but theres no Anji around, does that make her a pure maiden again?
[0:22:29] <%Juriasu> that's the fun part about crossovers like this imo, it's cool to feel like she's not even playing by the same rules

[0:30:58] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Tbh i myself just got over covid a couple of days ago. 3/10 wouldn't recommend it
[0:31:04] <%krispen_wa> PURGE THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR
[0:31:12] <leith_aziz> Do you mean "The victor writes history"?
[0:31:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> The old saying "it's order of magnitudes harder to refuse bullshit than create bullshit"
[0:31:26] <justcallmebobplease> @Twon_From_Wakanda So, besides the 'you didn't die' part, what else contributed to that score of 3/10?
[0:31:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> I believe plato came up with that
[0:31:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> People want to be the only correct person, because they want to be the one who changes the world
[0:31:37] <dds333a> @krispen_wa this is what I'm hoping for. just get rid of em Kappa
[0:31:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> Refute rather
[0:31:49] <DSD24> @Twon_From_Wakanda I hope you are feeling better!
[0:31:51] <%LastHazzerd> the guy who suggested washing your hands with soap was put in a psych ward
[0:31:51] <%krispen_wa> ALSO PURGE THE HIGHEST COMMON DENOMINATOR
[0:31:52] <Twon_From_Wakanda> The diarrhea sadly
[0:31:54] <+Hollow_Mirage> The people against electricity and claiming it would kill us all is a good example
[0:32:02] <+zanz_san> let's crash a colony on earth
[0:32:05] <%TubeMan642> History rarely accounts for stupid people
[0:32:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't get me started on people who believed ine 4 humors
[0:32:35] <%X2Eliah> @Hollow_Mirage It still might kill us all, WW3 just needs some massive arc lasers
[0:32:43] <cs0402196> What about the guy who made flexible glass and got killed by the king
[0:32:45] <%Prevot> more and more reason to call the current generation of kids Coroners

[0:33:14] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Aint gonna lie the worst part was the late night chill n body pain
[0:33:14] <dds333a> Or you were already retired, and in LITERAL fear for your life
[0:33:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Or you just got fired and never got a "from home job"
[0:33:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> I tell you what, the next generation is really set up to be Monk levels of OCD cleanlines

[0:34:51] <+EdenOfLove> personally i feel like continuing to lockdown is incredibly reckless, I don't feel like locking people down forever will ever work, and we'll have stuff that's way worse on the way
[0:34:54] <%X2Eliah> ye its a bkt big
[0:35:00] <+zanz_san> no one was there so we came early
[0:35:16] <+EdenOfLove> like the "anti-science" movement is bullshit but eventually people will refuse to follow along
[0:35:20] <%X2Eliah> Woolie does not deserve a Nago buff
[0:35:23] <%WeijiBeng> they will buff sol jonzheJOKER
[0:35:33] <%krispen_wa> I blame big pharma for being so scummy with their pricing practices that the moment they produce something necessary, no one believes them
[0:35:34] <+IxDomxI> if you buff nago you get arcade nago. as a nago player, i dont think you want that.
[0:35:34] <%kewlmyc> He won a tourney so he's getting nerfs
[0:35:36] <%dreadedcthulhu> nago is positioned perfectly fine lmao
[0:35:38] <+zanz_san> but yeah I live in Florida it's at the forefront of fucked
[0:35:42] <%Juriasu> Nago was second only to Sol in players in top 8 sooooo, I think he's fine

[0:47:16] <linSP> jojo theme park mariaCheesy
[0:47:24] <turboyabo> i mean professor mokoi
[0:47:36] <+megamanx74> Welcome to twitter
[0:47:41] <drunken_lemur> Golden Wind's first volume has just been added to the Shonen Jump app
[0:47:46] <%Prevot> JoJo Lands, featuring Johei Joestar
[0:47:48] <+zanz_san> How did Jojo 9 pan out?
[0:47:51] <%krispen_wa> Jojoland cant compete with Kaibaland
[0:47:51] <dds333a> @turboyabo he'll be here, just has to get down from Uluru LUL
[0:47:57] <%Juriasu> people lie or misundertand shit, and people who are gullible or naive will parrot the same info until everyone thinks it's the truth
[0:48:00] <%Lion_kun> Part 8 sucks, I hope Araki takes a nice long break for part 9 so he doesn't repeat his mistakes.
[0:48:00] <+zanz_san> I mean 8 sorry
[0:48:37] <+zanz_san> That's disappointing to hear
[0:48:37] <dds333a> people have been lying about Jojo since the forums
[0:48:38] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Part 8 was hard to read
[0:48:53] <%holydeviant1> I might get my mom to pick up Stone Ocean, purely on the basis of Jolyne
[0:48:55] <%Lion_kun> Hahahakke
[0:48:55] <turboyabo> 8 didnt really suck but to each there own
[0:49:02] <%WeijiBeng> Shenmue 3 is about to drop in the next [major event]
[0:49:10] <%Lion_kun> Hahahaha, like Araki plans anything
[0:49:10] <+Hollow_Mirage> The man Hasn‚Äôt aged since 1876 Kappa
[0:49:11] <dds333a> @turboyabo I agree
[0:49:23] <DSD24> Rivers in the desert
[0:49:24] <RICE02> Does Part 8 suck or does you? thats the real question in life
[0:49:24] <%Seancicle> ü§òüèª
[0:49:36] <%Lion_kun> Nothing in part 8 pays off and that final arc was just awful
[0:49:37] <dds333a> do you Kappa
[0:49:41] <%holydeviant1> @Hollow_Mirage Jojo, itself, is his phylactery, the moment it's over he will turn into dust
[0:49:41] <%WeijiBeng> PART 8 is steel ball?
[0:50:03] <turboyabo> no thats 7
[0:50:11] <delta278899> Without a Paddle
[0:50:13] <RICE02> Part 8 is just setup for Part 9
[0:50:13] <%Lion_kun> 8 is Jojolion
[0:50:16] <dds333a> appealing to wallet Kappa
[0:50:21] <%WeijiBeng> oh yeah jojolion
[0:50:29] <andre11dr> Damn ,i didn't catch the beginning
[0:50:31] <dds333a> Kappa
[0:50:35] <turboyabo> everything in part 8 pay off that involved everyone in that house that wasnt gappy
[0:50:42] <%krispen_wa> gappy and yasuho's relationship was cute
[0:50:43] <Tracazoid> Michael Caine says Jaws 4 paid for his house or something like that, which at that point I doubt he cares about the film's quality
[0:50:45] <+Hollow_Mirage> I only have 1 complaint with Part 8 and that is the misuse of the Plunder skill. If it was like Gold Experiences powers that were written out after 2 fights It makes sense but having the main power of stand disappear halfway through the arc and its just star platinum now
[0:50:48] <+Hollow_Mirage> Nah m8
[0:51:07] <%Juriasu> does Raiju not count as a flier?
[0:51:12] <kingra> Moh Shuvuu <3
[0:51:20] <andre11dr> So 8 ended huh
[0:51:27] <turboyabo> like araki needs a plot thread for part 9
[0:51:30] <%krispen_wa> and everything related to joshu is pure kino
[0:51:35] <andre11dr> Did it end good?
[0:51:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:37] <Chogex> these voice effects are top tier
[0:51:40] <%Lion_kun> The resolution of part 8 final boss is literally the same as 7 but shit.
[0:51:42] <linSP> kidnap one demon baby, kill the rest
[0:51:48] <%krispen_wa> Part 9 with Joshu for main protag pls
[0:52:00] <%holydeviant1> He is moving SO FAST he appears to be flying AT ALL TIMES
[0:52:04] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Part 8 is the experimental album everyone does.
[0:52:13] <%Lion_kun> Part 9 new girl jojo pls
[0:52:46] <%WeijiBeng> idk about all that chat, I dont really expect much out of jojo
[0:52:48] <andre11dr> Part 7 was already nuts so if 8 gose harder I'm fine with that
[0:52:49] <cs0402196> why does this look like a oldDS game?

[1:35:28] <TheHeroAppears> I will keep giving blowjob after blowjob until my husband is saved
[1:35:40] <DSD24> Raidou age comes up every time Woolie streams this game
[1:35:45] <TheMagneticDragon> He looks older than Demifiend, I'd say about 18
[1:35:50] <dds333a> @lasthazzerd nope, just working
[1:35:51] <JetpackMcQuack> be thorough
[1:35:55] <DSD24> I think he's 18
[1:36:12] <%LastHazzerd> odd way to phrase that statement then if she has no intention of looking
[1:36:13] <ryogeo> @brunoberserk in the game booklet it says raido is in his late teens so maybe 17 or 18 tops
[1:36:29] <andre11dr> I won't go home, i must  keep giving those FDs ,it's the only way to save him
[1:36:40] <TheMagneticDragon> Plus Raidou has a deep voice for a teenager so he's probably around 18-19
[1:36:47] <dds333a> @lasthazzerd well. she's also raising the money for her brother, and all that. but she wants whoever fucked him up found
[1:36:52] <mrblitzstream> Racking in that Schmoney
[1:37:27] <%Prevot> wtf does Narumi do in this office all day
[1:37:27] <%LastHazzerd> just sayin' that the bills aren't goin' away even if the guy is caught, so him being found wouldn't mark the end of her debt... unless they gonna get em to pay for damages

[1:44:11] <dds333a> @andre11dr indeed, and he varies from high-early game to mid. solid, usually

[2:18:30] <alrobot2014> holy shit that's crazy

[2:18:48] <Darkdrill> the union makes sense if you look at the history
[2:18:48] <%livlinn> in Hungary, taxi drivers protested against Uber and its BANNED now. (altho there's still similar services)
[2:18:49] <dds333a> there are always two sides

[3:08:10] <lashlak> So many interesting mechanics, such a boring combat system :(
[3:08:14] <%arkv01> I think this is where I stopped playing a couple of years ago ü§î
[3:09:17] <ShinChris> is this the ps2 cop one?
[3:09:23] <%dds333a> sure is
[3:09:45] <ShinChris> never played this one but it looked radical
[3:09:59] <andre11dr> I remember getting bored of the combat at the end of 2 ,but that's probably because Megydolo hits the whole screen for max damage and yyou don't really have to do anything
[3:10:17] <DSD24> That's the canon demon
[3:10:36] <%dds333a> @dsd24 as in, from the intro LUL
[3:10:44] <DSD24> Yep!
[3:11:36] <%dds333a> Between Nocturne, and both games (maybe even the manga, if you wanted to go there), Raidou has quite the "canon" assemblage
[3:12:03] <DSD24> Plus he has Yoshitsune
[3:12:23] <%dds333a> and a certain leaf man Kappa
[3:13:11] <ShinChris> i still have to go back and beat 4....but i found playing for hours on the 3ds is pretty uncomfortable
[3:13:22] <+gitgouda> what platform was this on?

[3:17:26] <%dds333a> maybe Kappa
[3:17:40] <%arkv01> most puzzling ü§î

[3:17:53] <secretbosssauce> What phase is the moon?
[3:17:54] <linSP> is it the moon phase maybe
[3:17:57] <+Artumoc> the phase?
[3:18:03] <zanzibarian_hamster> New moon
[3:18:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> ?
[3:18:12] <%dds333a> @secretbosssauce SeemsGood
[3:18:37] <Blank9> the moon is angry and wants you to cancel the fusion, no refunds
[3:18:40] <ShinChris> the fucking moon man
[3:18:43] <turboyabo> for demons at strongest is full moon
[3:18:53] <%dds333a> fusion has always depended on moon phase, yeah LUL
[3:18:56] <secretbosssauce> What do you get when you get a full moon fusion?
[3:18:58] <zanzibarian_hamster> Try turning the moon up to 8
[3:19:11] <Qu1ckyyy> Maybe because their STR stat is high
[3:19:46] <%moonmintparadise> oh no forgot the brb screen haha
[3:19:49] <%arkv01> get your stretches in VoHiYo
[3:19:52] <andre11dr> The moon phases have some very questionable mechanics
[3:19:55] <austinj24> Oh yeah check fusion options during full moon
[3:20:15] <%dds333a> it does, and the game will NEVER. tell you any of this, it will hint at best
[3:20:21] <linSP> sometimes full moon fusions result in accidents because too much power
[3:20:48] <+IxDomxI> SourPls
[3:20:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:20:55] <turboyabo> the game dose tell you it effects demons and raidou but not for fusion
[3:21:10] <andre11dr> Is the better RNG at full moon in this game?
[3:21:19] <%dds333a> @turboyabo that's what I'm referring to, it's effects on fusion
[3:21:30] <%dds333a> and victor  vaguely mentions it, and nothing else
[3:21:43] <turboyabo> yea
[3:21:45] <andre11dr> Cause that was annoying, spin in a circle before this chest to get the best loot
[3:21:53] <%dds333a> skills change that can be inherited also depend on moon phase
[3:21:56] <andrex2311> did I make it in time?
[3:22:30] <%dds333a> @andrex2311 they're on a break, so about halfway through the stream?

[4:16:17] <%dds333a> not even P2 is as bad as Raidou, the radar fills within three angles LUL
[4:17:26] <%dds333a> And P2 is great, barring, of course the encounter rate, and it's unwieldy, menu-based combat. at least the combat just goes if you set it up on autopilot.

[4:37:43] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[4:38:13] <Enn19> @dds333a I started figuring out how Atlus thinks,if there's one gimmick on one floor,and another on a different floor,you can BET they're going to be a floor right after with BOTH gimmicks
[4:39:05] <%dds333a> @enn19 case in point, the Karma Temple
[4:39:06] <andre11dr> Yeah that's pretty much every dungeon in Nocturne
[4:39:34] <jetstreamlove_R> This oozes pre DMC action inspired gameplay. Like Atlus attempt to make a KH Action RPG gameplay style
[4:39:57] <+fetrigon> LUL
[4:39:58] <andre11dr> This is like 2004
[4:40:00] <%paladinstarbuster> no bully
[4:40:00] <%elderpunch> if only they collaborated w these games
[4:40:03] <Enn19> The worst dungeon in Nocturne was uh.....I think where you free Futomimi. I forget what it's called,you go in mirrors
[4:40:08] <andre11dr> DMC 1 was long out
[4:40:20] <%elderpunch> @Enn19 the mist mirror dungeon yeah
[4:40:30] <%dds333a> @enn19 Kabukicho Prison?
[4:40:31] <%elderpunch> where u fight the water snake
[4:40:40] <Enn19> Yeah,Mishaguji
[4:40:41] <jetstreamlove_R> Except it hasn't gotten that popular to inspire the action genre
[4:41:05] <+fetrigon> hee ho
[4:41:09] <%elderpunch> if we ever get another raidou game we need platinum to take the reigns
[4:41:10] <zecht89> The only reason I haven't finished Nocturne, the crappy dungeons
[4:41:16] <%dds333a> @enn19 Mizuchi, Mishaguji is something MUCH different LUL
[4:41:32] <+JupiterDjin> Jack Frost is powdering his hand up
[4:41:43] <Enn19> Nocturne was easier for me since I know the king of tricks dungeons can pull,and it seemed less annoying than Strange Journey
[4:41:46] <%elderpunch> @dds333a penis monster
[4:41:51] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:41:52] <andre11dr> My most hated Nocturne dungeon in Nocturne was when your chasing Kyron FUCK THAT PLACE
[4:41:54] <Enn19> @dds333a OH NO WAIT YOU'RE RIGHT
[4:41:59] <DSD24> She's trying her best man
[4:42:07] <jetstreamlove_R> Platinum can easily make this good, they proved it whit Automata
[4:42:07] <%elderpunch> i used a guide for nocturnes dungeons
[4:42:10] <Giztech> lighting?
[4:42:18] <DSD24> @andre11dr Oh wow that place is the worst
[4:42:20] <%elderpunch> the obelisk tower was pain
[4:42:59] <andre11dr> Kapla if you don't know what your doing can also be a nightmare
[4:43:11] <%elderpunch> the kalpas are literally hell
[4:43:13] <%elderpunch> literally
[4:43:21] <Fnir> isn't it the same color ?
[4:43:29] <%dds333a> slightly different, yeah
[4:43:31] <%elderpunch> and dante chasing ur ass down
[4:43:38] <Enn19> @dds333a They don't look like that in other games that have them tho,like Touhou they're just giant snakes
[4:43:53] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The bird can not in fact do it
[4:43:54] <%dds333a> @enn19 true
[4:44:05] <%dds333a> all diff interpretations

[4:45:13] <Enn19> Ain't Mara just a slang for wang essentially?
[4:45:21] <%elderpunch> arioch??
[4:45:27] <Enn19> I thought that was a thing
[4:45:43] <%elderpunch> yes mara is literally just penis
[4:45:50] <%elderpunch> japan has a mara fetsival
[4:45:54] <%dds333a> Arioch is the vag demon
[4:46:00] <andre11dr> Nah the white bird in Nocturne, it has a wierd ass name
[4:46:24] <Enn19> @elderpunch That's.....Something I'm glad I know about so I can stay away from it
[4:46:46] <Enn19> @andre11dr Hraesvelgr?

[4:48:31] <%elderpunch> devil summoner quetzacoatl is the coolest design
[4:48:43] <%dds333a> yeah, Red Capes are spawned from doubt. negativity, and despair. then you feed in on yourself and become that
[4:48:48] <Enn19> @dds333a Wait what? I thought that was the bird with one of nine suns on it's back?
[4:48:59] <brunoberserk> so the red cape is a pre-behelit ??
[4:49:07] <andre11dr> Wow ,despair, I'm sure they won't rehash that full sail in the sequel Kappa

[5:18:26] <%LastHazzerd> He'll GIVE you shit
[5:18:33] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @NopeBadguy
[5:18:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> LUL
[5:18:40] <ullyzeez> there new dumb shit from harada??
[5:18:50] <%dds333a> DON'T ASK HIM FOR ANYTHING EVER AGAIN
[5:19:15] <HotSauceFiend> so i just popped in. Is this.... a good game? It's from 1995 so I never played this thing
[5:19:21] <+Mrbaconator> "why it doesn't work" so he hired them for anti rollback propaganda
[5:19:22] <ullyzeez> nice wow you get to work for Riot????
[5:19:24] <andre11dr> Don't ask Harada for shit ,that includes rollback
[5:19:24] <drunken_lemur> I thought Woolie said ROBOT not ROLLBACK
[5:19:37] <%dds333a> @hotsaucefiend great game, but this os a different game
[5:19:52] <%GHouseduivel> The Suffering ?
[5:19:53] <%dds333a> in the dame franchise, but a different game
[5:19:59] <%dds333a> *same
[5:20:07] <Phob05> These graphics in 95 would blow peoples minds
[5:20:17] <HotSauceFiend> oh so this isnt JUST Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner?
[5:20:34] <andre11dr> No
[5:20:35] <Joestar1890> @HotSauceFiend It's good, though it gameplay has not aged well. Also it came out in 2006.
[5:20:36] <%dds333a> @hotsaucefiend correct. this is a game later in said series
[5:20:41] <andre11dr> This is Radiou 1
[5:21:09] <%dds333a> completely
[5:21:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1427490836829417483?s=19
[5:21:14] <HotSauceFiend> Thanks, this whole franchise is something I am seeing for the first time. I have no clue whats going on here .I though this was an old Ace attorney type game
[5:21:28] <Phob05> Victor will have to move back in with his parents!
[5:21:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Sounds like someone needs a Bailout
[5:21:45] <Joestar1890> This is the third game in the Devil Summoner series
[5:22:09] <andre11dr> Radiou 1 is not the worst place to start because it's relatively straight forward, story and gameplay
[5:22:22] <Phob05> erm
[5:22:23] <%dds333a> @andre11dr this
[5:22:25] <Phob05> well
[5:22:27] <plushysceptile> Also first chronologically
[5:22:40] <Joestar1890> @HotSauceFiend Oh no, far from it. It's more like Atlus trying to make a DMC game with some SMT mechanics, if you've ever played P5 Strikers, imagine that but way less advanced.
[5:23:03] <Joestar1890> @andre11dr Plus it's the earliest game in the SMT timeline
[5:23:16] <%dds333a> yup, in the corner
[5:23:28] <%livlinn> spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance
[5:23:29] <%dds333a> below the glasses
[5:23:38] <%RyTYoung> What do you mean, it's clearly historically accurate Kappa
[5:23:38] <%kewlmyc> Mr. Sunglasses
[5:23:41] <secretbosssauce> *Looks at Steven Hawking*
[5:23:50] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Don't be silly Lex Luthor stole the cakes
[5:23:53] <%GHouseduivel> +2 reggie
[5:24:01] <+NopeBadguy> reminder that steven hawking created the devil summoning program in smt1
[5:24:10] <%LastHazzerd> he's got cool shades tho
[5:24:11] <andre11dr> Who made this technology shit ,oh hy Stephen
[5:24:17] <plushysceptile> Just don't let your mom know you're playing them devil games yet again
[5:24:24] <stardustcrusad3r> woobie
[5:24:28] <Joestar1890> Steven Hawking ascended and became a 4th dimensional being
[5:24:33] <drunken_lemur> Maybe Brazil, but not Tijuana.
[5:24:39] <Make_me_mad> Remember that secret boss fight against stephen hawking, where in phase 2 he gets out of the chair?
[5:24:47] <DSD24> His cool red suit
[5:24:55] <%RyTYoung> Can you roll that by me Woolie...?
[5:24:57] <Joestar1890> @Make_me_mad Y'all mind if I....STAND UP?
[5:25:05] <%dds333a> or your wrist computer
[5:25:06] <Joestar1890> Tijuana is in Mexico tho
[5:25:06] <Phob05> Well, he started this process by making a teleporter
[5:25:09] <%elderpunch> a highschooler created the demon summoner app first
[5:25:30] <%dds333a> @phob05 and the resulting demon crippled him, yeah
[5:25:34] <DSD24> Nakajima
[5:25:35] <andre11dr> There's a lot of them
[5:25:41] <Phob05> Yep
[5:25:42] <andre11dr> Many are traps
[5:25:43] <Joestar1890> @elderpunch Didn't he base his program after Stephen's research though?
[5:25:47] <%kewlmyc> Persona 5 Royal, what's the worst that could happen? Kappa
[5:25:51] <umbrellaswereawesome> Woolie vs. Jack Bros.
[5:26:02] <andre11dr> Woolie vs Devil Kids
[5:26:02] <%dds333a> @elderpunch can't forget about vengeful asshole Akemi Nakajima
[5:26:15] <+FataltheBaptist> i still have this ps2 game
[5:26:31] <%dds333a> @joestar1890 not in the original Digital Devil Story, at least
[5:26:31] <Joestar1890> Woolie Vs. Aegis: First Mission
[5:26:49] <andre11dr> Oh yeah that's out
[5:27:27] <Phob05> Megami Tensei and SMT are not canonically linked. SMT is basically whan a fan fic writer wants to have their own universe so they change the names
[5:27:42] <%dds333a> it's a good one
[5:27:54] <%Lion_kun> P5S>>>>P5R
[5:27:56] <%Lion_kun> fight me nerds
[5:27:58] <+NopeBadguy> Really? Even before VF1?
