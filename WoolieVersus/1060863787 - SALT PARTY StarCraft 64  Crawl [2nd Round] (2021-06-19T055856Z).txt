[0:08:13] <+ExceedSC> It's easy, make workers, don't get supply blocked, by making depots/overlords/pylons, make more production to spend money
[0:08:14] <dds333a> Please Understand ThankEgg
[0:08:17] <%alpharius88> ok why there is kerringan(zerg) marine and another zerg where is the protos?
[0:08:17] <+jayayanami> no, no, no. the frames or lack thereof adds to the aesthetic.

[0:08:48] <PersonifiedTFT> @thetunnelhomer it can't be a three houses trashfire because the trash is coming from the game itself
[0:08:49] <dds333a> Sounds about right
[0:08:49] <RamenRiderZ> "I don't even play this game!"

[0:11:07] <leith_aziz> Jesus, the new Castle Super Beast video came out and the comment section is fucking depressing. I get not liking it, but the reaction is redicillous. You might not like some changes, but people are harping on it like it's a trash heap of a game. It's actually scaring off newcomers who liked it cause of the negativity.

[1:27:31] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:27:36] <FullMetalSnorlax> I didn't imagine this game's multiplayer would be taking turns
[1:27:58] <crimsonsaens> Only 1 challenge per floor actually
[1:28:18] <someyounguy1> @FullMetalSnorlax its less like turns and more like team switching. everyones always playing, just not for the same team
[1:28:24] <MrPandastic> @FullMetalSnorlax Yup, but you only get your turn IF your goood enough.
[1:28:48] <JetpackMcQuack> fire bad
[1:28:57] <+GenesisKnight> Fire indeed hot

[1:29:40] <Louie_Salmon> Mm
[1:29:45] <crimsonsaens> It would be stupid, wouldn't it
[1:29:45] <%d1stantutopia> bought the advanced roll to replace the advanced roll
[1:29:58] <+OblivionSword1> no time to read
[1:30:04] <crimsonsaens> Look at it this way, it denies the others from getting advanced roll
[1:30:05] <WG101> THE GRAPPLER RETURNS
[1:30:32] <bevyrage> everyone already has advanced roll though?
[1:30:37] <pacibuddy> the dokage is here
[1:30:53] <dubstep_paladin> DO COMBO
[1:31:09] <crimsonsaens> Someone has the magic bow shot
[1:31:28] <Louie_Salmon> Was that a bonfire just now
[1:31:38] <crimsonsaens> Yeah, that was a bonfire
[1:32:35] <JetpackMcQuack> Do combo
[1:32:36] <%d1stantutopia> It really bothers me that they all keep messing up on the mimics
[1:32:47] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:32:51] <%d1stantutopia> Just charging at them with their slow movement instead of being an ambush predator
[1:32:54] <Louie_Salmon> Shoulda read that ring
[1:33:02] <crimsonsaens> He can't see the healing either
[1:33:10] <bevyrage> minh not noticing the guy dropping healing orbs
[1:33:14] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:33:17] <bevyrage> oh god right
[1:33:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> yeyeye i love crawl
[1:33:44] <slix3431> Throwin hands
[1:33:53] <crimsonsaens> This game might be the most disadvantaged Minh has ever had
[1:33:58] <%d1stantutopia> >taking the portal when the shop door is RIGHT THERE
[1:34:00] <%d1stantutopia> AHHHHHHH
[1:34:40] <Hydrapissed> LOl
[1:34:47] <MrPandastic> PFFFFFFT
[1:34:55] <Louie_Salmon> Buying both of those potions would be a strict upgrade lol
[1:35:30] <%d1stantutopia> @Louie_Salmon Yeah, buying multiple potions is always a good strat as long as you keep the stat increases roughly equal
[1:35:33] <crimsonsaens> Potions are always positive stat bonuses
[1:35:48] <dds333a> hmmmmmm
[1:36:12] <WG101> ALL AT LEVEL 10
[1:36:46] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[1:36:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:36:52] <raikagelord1> This game seems cool
[1:37:00] <%d1stantutopia> This game IS cool
[1:37:03] <%Josef_Stryker> So what kind of game is this?
[1:37:20] <+chiazam> Is this the return of Salt Party?
[1:37:35] <+GearheadGoof> It's basically like a PvP roguelike where the other players control the monsters
[1:37:36] <dds333a> Co-op dungeon crawler, somewhat
[1:37:37] <crimsonsaens> It's a party game, but it's pretty fun solo too as an arcadey dungeon crawler
[1:37:37] <%d1stantutopia> @Josef_Stryker roguelite dungeon crawling betrayal sim
[1:37:44] <IzanagiNoOokami> Check how hard I can pee.
[1:37:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I see woolie does the same ghost start i do LUL
[1:37:46] <%Josef_Stryker> So are they taking turns?
[1:37:50] <Hydrapissed> PvP roguelite
[1:37:52] <dds333a> @chiazam sure is
[1:37:54] <%Josef_Stryker> Seeing how gets farthest?
[1:37:56] <%Josef_Stryker> *who
[1:38:09] <+GearheadGoof> Whenever you kill the hero you get to play as them, they're trying to beat the boss first
[1:38:13] <%hologram_sam> givm the shimmy
[1:38:15] <Hydrapissed> all playing same time to either kill each other or the guy alive fights the final boss
[1:38:16] <dds333a> That, and who wins, since there is a definite end
[1:38:31] <%Josef_Stryker> I see
[1:38:36] <dds333a> More easily reachable, at least, end
[1:38:53] <%Josef_Stryker> Is this a PC game or is it on consoles too?
[1:39:00] <Hydrapissed> consoles and pc yeh

[1:39:55] <Louie_Salmon> Wh- b- literally every stat go up
[1:40:46] <crimsonsaens> It does take some getting used to the systems in this game, especially since there's pressure to keep the pace high
[1:40:57] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL

[1:44:04] <+ripperdip> Depression
[1:44:05] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Damn. My friends couldn't keep interest long enough in this game for us to make it to the final boss
[1:44:09] <crimsonsaens> It's keeps your win counts, until you're consumed
[1:44:12] <FullMetalSnorlax> play zerg soccer :P
[1:44:14] <%andrewofbob> So, it's a bit of a Yoko Taro roguelike?
[1:44:26] <raikagelord1> Great game
[1:44:34] <%d1stantutopia> @andrewofbob never thought of it like that but yes, exactly
[1:44:40] <MrPandastic> There are some solid footsies in this game.
[1:44:41] <theredfox930000> crawling in my skin
[1:44:52] <Solidnick18> that was fun

[1:47:16] <FullMetalSnorlax> starcraft remaster full LP lets go
[1:47:56] <+DreyfussFrost> Remaster's great for modern OS compatability but the actual changes aren't great.  The full game is free now though, you really don't miss anything with the free version.

[1:50:30] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Starcraft CD key also was super simple so only the last number mattered, meaning you could put stuff like 1234567891234 and it would validate
