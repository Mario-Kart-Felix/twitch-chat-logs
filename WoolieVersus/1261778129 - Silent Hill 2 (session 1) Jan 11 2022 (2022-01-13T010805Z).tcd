[0:02:19] <%phd_in_thuggery> Cheer500 Hey there! wanted to drop a suggestion for something that you are free to totally dismiss! The devs of Big Bang Beat are having their first game ported to Switch and Steam later this year. It's a Touhou Castlevania fangame called Koumajou Densetsu, genuinely a fun intro to the world of Touhou and it's level based like Rondo of Blood. I'd suggest looking up the artist for the game, Banpai Akira. Dude literally mastered the Ayami Kojima style
[0:02:19] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Brain hurty
[0:02:20] <%ThePich> no i'm gonna bully

[0:10:25] <fairore> James for mario  kart 9
[0:10:28] <%X2Eliah> Noise filter will shit up compression on the twitch and YT, no?
[0:10:28] <%Onorekian> i think the ps2 original version has noise on by default
[0:10:28] <turkidre> put it back on
[0:10:30] <AoiRob> wouldnt it screw the bitrate or smth?
[0:10:33] <fuji_n2> up to you really
[0:10:34] <+boosh5> On as intended
[0:10:40] <skyshinecrusader> definitely on
[0:10:41] <%Feifong_wong> Noise on, there is a setting in the .ini file to make it higher resolution
[0:10:41] <robobeau> Noise is the intended experience.
[0:10:42] <@Solidus_113> it'll jank up the bitrate
[0:10:42] <delicious_mystery> on
[0:10:48] <ZeeJiggle> That makes sense.
[0:10:48] <Louie_Salmon> I think on is more authentic, off might be a nicer look

[0:10:50] <robobeau> Ahhhhhhhhh
[0:10:51] <%Javaa01> @AoiRob It's very light

[0:10:53] <waltzqueen> fair
[0:10:53] <@Menitta> oooh the visual noise
[0:10:53] <moontail95> noise on looks better imo

[0:11:01] <WaifusSansFrontieres> noise on is the style of the game
[0:11:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Wouldn't noise mess up the stream?
[0:11:03] <@Menitta> I thought that was like audio
[0:11:03] <lehvak182> yeah
[0:11:07] <%Grimlockfly> Noise filter is how it was on ps2

[0:32:31] <lostallmyaccs> that line is a classic LUL
[0:32:32] <peachy996> That's how I feel every day when someone reminds me of something I forgot about

[0:32:35] <MayorRev> Lost?????
[0:32:35] <%mr_sups> Lawst
[0:32:36] <koban333tv> LOooost??
[0:32:37] <+Frranky> @Frranky mr. cihi has some strong opinions about vaccines and 5g let's just say that
[0:32:38] <+StooEsq> I actually like the VA sounding disjointed, since it implies that everyone here is broken
[0:32:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> Doesn't elaborate further. Awkwardly leaves.
[0:32:43] <AngryAsian5> LOoooOoOsT?
[0:32:43] <%livlinn> LoOOOOOST? kiichiOmegalul
[0:32:43] <Medo3G> That's Donna Burke I think

[0:33:13] <delicious_mystery> woolie you need to find the gens before trapper or billy finds you
[0:33:14] <+Mkingston> is this more fog than the PS2 version?
[0:33:15] <%qonfiguration> graves and fog, always good sign
[0:33:16] <Potatoidea> I actually kinda like how she said "mama" then corrected herself because it was like she suddenly remembered she was talking to a stranger
[0:33:17] <+Lionkevinson> Mama!!!
[0:33:17] <Nabs96> @medo3g that was Donna Burke?

[0:33:22] <lostallmyaccs> yeah, the awkward VA makes way more sense in a second playthrough
[0:33:23] <%X2Eliah> Couold be a good weapon
[0:33:24] <plaguedoctor_vi> this is going to be intresting Woolie playing the game and maybe remember things the VA said
[0:33:24] <%superc37> @linsp well i mean yeah it is lol.
[0:33:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Frranky oh nooooo
[0:33:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> you say that

[0:34:32] <spiderously> @majindusto Modded PC version, called the "Enhanced Edition"
[0:34:34] <screwintuna> The fog is a metaphor for not being able to see through fog
[0:34:36] <%Javaa01> Also, we aren't even in Silent Hill
[0:34:40] <%Feifong_wong> SH1 is way scarier
[0:34:42] <dukenux> in ng+ you csn find a chainsaw here

[0:34:47] <legacy0117> Silent Hill fog actually just time dilating weed smoke. LUL
[0:34:50] <+healnavi> @nabs96 It's not how you talk to a stranger. it's a very familiar, odd way of talking.
[0:34:54] <drunken_lemur> So no Comic Sans sign?
[0:34:54] <+Stupid121v2> @Nabs96 more how she said it imo, very childish "Ma ma..."
[0:34:54] <%qonfiguration> schmoovement is possible still
[0:34:54] <Nabs96> @th3smartalec I need to rewatch that LP then lol I don't remember that joke at all

[0:35:25] <peachy996> This game doesn't want to scare you it wants to put you on edge and make you uncomfortable

[0:41:06] <%holydeviant1> @samuraiknack Bathroom stall tech and UNTANKING, but we're lmost to town
[0:41:06] <Spagheddies> Early 00s

[0:41:10] <hartounian> 80s
[0:41:11] <SyLuX45> It’s like starting a game with a Magnum instead of a shitty pistol
[0:41:12] <+Gohyakuen> 199x

[1:02:41] <legacy0117> The birds and doggo flesh monsters must have gotten out of an animal shelter on the northern part of Silent Hill.
[1:02:44] <+spacepiratezod> Anyone else love when Woolie says "You notice anything else interesting" Fuckin DM energy

[1:24:23] <Cherokia666> I'd poke it with a board, but I'm smart
[1:24:24] <dukenux> or just push it with your piece of wood?
[1:24:25] <amiavamp> can't just push it down with the stick
[1:24:27] <+Firgof> Things James is not: An efficient engineer

[1:26:37] <Teradyne87> It's like old cable, it'll fuzz out as it gets worse? If you see softcore, you 'bout to die
[1:26:38] <KaiserMario> This LP proves Woolie doesn't actually listens to Pat
[1:26:39] <%Feifong_wong> Green is full, normal coloring is okay, light red like that is hurt, much darker red is critical
[1:26:40] <screwintuna> ok guys but it's actually really obvious and that they aren't picking up on it is telling
[1:26:41] <DSD24> My w i fe
[1:26:43] <+Firgof> My favorite setpiece in the series is in SH3 though. Completely optional and easily missed too.

[1:27:50] <+Firgof> I got lost as shit while playing it in its release year and was just kinda trying everything.
[1:28:00] <delicious_mystery> if its brown drink it down, if its black send it back
[1:28:02] <+Firgof> Finding that made me completely forgive the bumbling around I'd done for the last 30 minutes.

[5:48:35] <%IronOhki> I think emote only was fine for the potential spoilers.
[5:48:37] <BlackermanZX> and then one guy still tried to spoil with emotes
[5:48:37] <%MajorCrasher> what a hilarious game LUL

[5:48:41] <+vaporousTippler> Someone was bound to fuck up.

[5:48:49] <jenji919> No big emote only

[5:48:52] <+SenorCounter> Chat timeout is fine
[5:48:52] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus I've been holding it in for hours. The pyramid head boss fight is timed not bullet based
[5:48:53] <tux_3do> go emote only

[5:48:55] <+extradopeness> OOP AHH LUL
[5:48:56] <Fabpsi_> oh yes, emote only during the gameplay is a must

[5:49:38] <dds333a> Nah, not by my estimate
[5:49:41] <StillJustARatInACage> afaik shooting makes it go faster?
[5:49:41] <%okuriskyles> gottem
[5:49:41] <horriblegoatdemon> Bullet AND time based
[5:49:44] <ghilbor> he has a health bar too i believe
[5:49:47] <dds333a> yep, it was Kappa
[5:49:50] <%Javaa01> Bullets speed up the timer
[5:49:52] <seboyo2> I love the way you guys played
[5:49:53] <brunoberserk> time AND bullets
[5:49:53] <%waltzqueen> Bullet AND time
[5:49:55] <TheButtravage> Pretty sure bullets end the encounter earlier.
[5:49:57] <artoflec> you basically speed up the timer by attacking
[5:49:57] <+vvitchguy> I think bullets speed it up.
[5:49:57] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Le meow
[5:49:58] <dukenux> i think it started by someone spoiling the clock puzzle solution, and then just went on
[5:50:00] <%HeroToxiko> Bullettime LUL
[5:50:05] <JacknZack27> I thought it was bullet based

[5:50:16] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus we're both right
[5:50:19] <RickyRelucent> pat hetic
[5:50:19] <+ElBuraindo> Bullets help staying safe
[5:50:21] <thomasvalentine31> Yup: I wanted to say that so bad but I know why you guys made it emote only: cuz Silent Hill 2 is something to experience
[5:50:23] <gnarly_memes_bro> I don't know shit about this game but i'll stop using yay and nay if they cause confusion
[5:50:23] <SoaringTrumpet> this is one of those games where emote only makes sense if you're ever gonna use that feature I guess
[5:50:24] <dukenux> Time based: 5 hours
[5:50:25] <dds333a> LUL
[5:50:26] <%Irridium> it's pee based

[5:50:45] <+ElBuraindo> I didn't know he could still swing at you while running away
[5:50:45] <jorniev> THE first letters of the clock puzzle names where H M S
[5:50:46] <artoflec> you're really movin in this one compared to 1 I feel like
[5:50:46] <No3rdImpactPlz> What platform is Woolie playing this on?
[5:50:46] <%hereiam407> James acting like an idiot
[5:50:48] <+PunishedBuck> watch james' head more, you kept walking past key items
[5:50:50] <dukenux> Which one?
[5:50:53] <Fabpsi_> the nays were probably for "are we back in reality?" , i think 1 of you asked that
[5:50:53] <28moogles> I think people just wanted you to walk out of that room.
[5:50:56] <rabbitective> that was 5 hours ago
[5:50:58] <%Deekman> yeah i've got no idea wtf was up with that
[5:51:00] <+Theassmasta> nothing went wrong
[5:51:01] <rabbitective> we don't remember
[5:51:03] <%waltzqueen> you asked if we were in REality
[5:51:04] <+Jiggisnipe> are we back in reality maybe
[5:51:05] <%hereiam407> We think James is stupid, that's why we hold our heads
[5:51:08] <%robosqueeb> you didn't play the game how I did rrreeeeee
[5:51:08] <depressioncherrie> I think "Nay" was about your comment that you are back to the "normal world" when in fact you entered the nightmare hotel
[5:51:10] <%jinking79> melee weapons i guess was for Nayw
[5:51:11] <jett_eyes> Silent Hill scary
[5:51:11] <dds333a> I have no idea
[5:51:12] <JacknZack27> I don’t think there was a problem
[5:51:13] <%ChoculaUltra> I think its because people know how much you guys love that emote Kappa
[5:51:14] <peachy996> Which fight?
[5:51:16] <Ultra_Pancake> Maybe ppl's head holding was just them being freaked out by the spooks lol.
[5:51:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie did you ever get your Red Box
[5:51:20] <Fabpsi_> still only a guess on my side, no idea
[5:51:20] <28moogles> The save anywhere thing is a mod that leads to you stopping at weird times.
[5:51:20] <bleugh> reality Kappa
[5:51:21] <Kriss1827> chat was memeing prob
[5:51:21] <peachy996> I dunno
[5:51:22] <Phob05> I think it was the clock room and Henry Mildred Scott
[5:51:23] <%livlinn> It’s all fine
[5:51:26] <dukenux> Because Harry "ow my head"
[5:51:29] <nailwind> it was nothing, pay no mind
[5:51:35] <+vvitchguy> Pyramid Head  = Ancient Aliens?
[5:51:36] <%ChoculaUltra> @dukenux see now that makes sense
[5:51:40] <jorniev> when he walks into the water you already had won and you were still shooting so that must be that.
[5:51:44] <SoaringTrumpet> the nays and yeas still trying to spoil lol
[5:51:50] <+extradopeness> TheIlluminati TheIlluminati
[5:51:57] <dukenux> @jorniev oh yea that too
[5:51:58] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Pyramid Head was antifa all along

[5:52:37] <dukenux> Yea, those inventory sprites are REALLY hi def
[5:52:38] <nailwind> do combo for save
[5:52:39] <NireFuster> By the way Woolie how did you like those cutscenes with Angela and Maria? They're easily the highlights of SH2, they're amazing

[5:53:05] <%Javaa01> This does also just have straight up a quick save button you can bind, and that is more or less a direct savestate
[5:53:09] <Fabpsi_> amazing game and very interesting gameplay, very fun to watch you guys. Buuuut still, god I hate this little brat
[5:53:10] <dds333a> There were also combos, so it kinda WAS a GIFG LUL
[5:53:10] <%hereiam407> So good
[5:53:16] <%hereiam407> Good stick moves
[5:53:27] <%MajorCrasher> I'm genuinely still trying to figure out why people like this game other than for the laughs
[5:53:28] <28moogles> Just keep in mind this game came out in 2001. Way ahead of it's time in terms of themes, tone, and story.
[5:53:29] <nailwind> great progress for first session
[5:53:30] <%Deekman> how far through the game are they?
[5:53:30] <+vvitchguy> Two years apart only between 1 and 2!!!!
[5:53:34] <bamberfool> Laura did nothing wrong
[5:53:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:53:38] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Wait, just got here, they're playing SH2?! ALREADY?
[5:53:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> But what does Angela's Knife do in Gunslinger? Kappa
[5:53:45] <BreakfastSampler> @Deekman in the hospital
[5:53:46] <jenji919> Eddie did nothing wrong he said so himself
[5:53:47] <%hereiam407> How can you just sit there and eat pizza?
[5:53:55] <%Deekman> @Deekman % wise i mean
[5:54:02] <%waltzqueen> Please end this LP with a pizza
[5:54:03] <dukenux> How could Eddie just sit there and eat PIZZA??
[5:54:04] <%ChoculaUltra> @ANGRA_MAlNYU they made a lot of solid progress in just one sesh too
[5:54:04] <%okuriskyles> it's true eddie would never lie just look at him
[5:54:05] <dds333a> @jenji919 FATSO
[5:54:06] <peachy996> a decent percent
[5:54:08] <AngryAsian5> Reggie unlocked
[5:54:10] <nailwind> the pizza line is my favorite line in the entire series, so funny
[5:54:15] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> woolieEVIL
[5:54:18] <iswearimjustdandy> How did eddie get the pizaa
[5:54:18] <seboyo2> The game aged poorly in terms of gameplay, but in graphics, world design, and narrative it still holds up very well.
[5:54:29] <StillJustARatInACage> whens Woolie n Reggie VS Homecoming
[5:54:40] <peachy996> How do you like the music? IT's not so much industrial it's just unsettling
[5:54:42] <dukenux> @iswearimjustdandy that dead guy in the bathroom was pizza delivery
[5:54:42] <dds333a> @stilljustaratinacage
[5:54:44] <dds333a> Kappa
[5:54:45] <Phob05> I think Guy Cihi had a problem with the pizza line bc he thought it was too silly
[5:54:45] <majindusto> Maria didn't  do anything  wrong...Y'all just  mean lol
[5:54:46] <%ChoculaUltra> @seboyo2 I feel like you can say that about 95% of the PS2 library LUL
[5:54:49] <bamberfool> maybe Eddie's haunted by pizza-man monsters
[5:55:07] <28moogles> Yeah, it'd have been great if we kept getting Silent Hill games to see that happen, huh?
[5:55:08] <%hereiam407> True
[5:55:10] <iswearimjustdandy> @dukenux >8O
[5:55:15] <+DatAsuna> You actually have less moves than 4 though
[5:55:30] <dds333a> @majindusto I dunno know about anybodyelse, but I was Kreygasm over  Maria the entire time LUL
[5:55:33] <%MajorCrasher> nothing nothing happens
[5:55:36] <%hereiam407> Yep
[5:55:38] <zhenthrim213> stelthgamerbtr videos
[5:55:39] <%ChoculaUltra> too bad Konami hates money and good will FeelsBadMan
[5:55:40] <%hereiam407> For sure
[5:55:42] <NireFuster> ABsolutely
[5:55:43] <+DatAsuna> MGS4 was peak of redunant/superfluous features, especially CQC
[5:55:46] <BlackermanZX> it just gets kinda faster iirc
[5:55:49] <jman13131313> yes
[5:55:54] <peachy996> I disagree Asuna
[5:55:54] <%okuriskyles> You'd think that, but SH3 is actually pretty different
[5:55:56] <majindusto> cannot  wait til we eventually  get to Woolie  vs Silent Hill 4: The Room
[5:55:57] <NireFuster> You don't wanna give the player the ability to Shoryuken the monsters
[5:55:59] <+blkalucard1> I hear voices but I don't see anybody who's talking lol
[5:56:01] <UncleMcgoo> Combat somehow gets worse after 4
[5:56:08] <peachy996> There just needed to be more gameplay to use it in 4
[5:56:09] <dds333a> they start emphasizing gunplay in some of them, a bit too much
[5:56:11] <+PunishedBuck> feel free to use guns, there's a lot of ammo in this game
[5:56:20] <majindusto> Maria enigmaButt
[5:56:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> an unfinished product, etc.
[5:56:28] <dukenux> If Woolie plays 4 on stream, he'll officialy be braver that Pat
[5:56:29] <+DatAsuna> @peachy996 The number of CQC moves vs the GZ punch combo or grab is just numbes, not opinion. lol
[5:56:32] <%waltzqueen> @majindusto im already preparing for the yelling
[5:56:33] <nailwind> @majindusto esort mission the game
[5:56:34] <+SolidusRex> Silent Hill 3 is mostly the same with some slight improvements controlls/gameplaywise, there's no need to worry about anything after 4 since it's mostly garbage
[5:56:35] <nailwind> pog
[5:56:42] <luftraumm1> youd have to  broaden the concept of gameplay, it could be something with more investigation and puzzles
[5:56:48] <%hereiam407> MMmmmmm Sausage Pizza
[5:57:03] <luftraumm1> gameplay doesnt have to be combat is what I mean
[5:57:04] <peachy996> @DatAsuna Nah
[5:57:05] <majindusto> Please No Spoils
[5:57:10] <+DatAsuna> @peachy996 Superfluous isn't a bad thing, that's the charm of older MGS
[5:57:13] <a_cadorna> Shout out from the Philippines!
[5:57:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> GIVE ME THAT SNOW
[5:57:17] <+pupil31> Go crazy
[5:57:20] <%itzzaPIZZA> end of stream?
[5:57:26] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Snow is ultimate trash
[5:57:29] <dukenux> also, Maria is hardly an escort(mission), she just follows you around. you have to really try to make her die to the monsters
[5:57:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> OMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[5:57:32] <dds333a> LUL
[5:57:37] <rosemon5001> any spoils get the tearChoo1 tearChoo2 tearChoo3
[5:57:44] <dukenux> but maybe i'm just comparing her to Eileen
[5:57:47] <UncleMcgoo> I'd love a downpour playthrough eventually, game is such a goofy disaster
[5:57:49] <a_cadorna> Shoutout from the Philippines! <3
[5:57:50] <peachy996> @DatAsuna Problem with 4 and GZ/V is too much gameplay in one and too much story in the other
[5:58:08] <dds333a> @dukenux well, of course LUL
[5:58:16] <+theoldone001> Why didn't you catch all those bugs Woolie??
[5:58:17] <nailwind> James is definitely a lancer, he got that good thrusting form with the pipe
[5:58:18] <dds333a> LUL
[5:58:26] <+DatAsuna> @peachy996 I actually feel like GZ/V is lacking gameplay with many features cut from 4/PW lmao
[5:58:29] <Phob05> Did Pat kill Maria in the LP?
[5:58:33] <%Dapper_Cactuar> snow is great in small timer periods
[5:58:36] <majindusto> Eileen gcan get a weapon  at least
[5:58:40] <Tyrdiel> Y’all should do Parasite Eve
[5:58:49] <majindusto> *can
[5:58:51] <Qu1ckyyy> oof
[5:58:56] <zhenthrim213> @Tyrdiel they did
[5:59:10] <peachy996> @DatAsuna Yeah there just asn't a proper balance after 3
[5:59:15] <+mechslayer71> horizon has goofy shit, but not that goofy
[5:59:16] <majindusto> lol at Forza
[5:59:19] <Tyrdiel> @zhenthrim213 gunna check it out
[5:59:22] <%Cozy90> God I want another wipeout
[5:59:24] <brunoberserk> BURNOUT
[5:59:27] <+mechslayer71> forza has top gear missions, literally
[5:59:30] <rosemon5001> bottom gear *
[5:59:30] <dukenux> Play Carmageddon then
[5:59:33] <+DatAsuna> Forza does lean into the top gear stuff explicitly with top gear crossovers. lol
[5:59:34] <skyshinecrusader> thats what they said
[5:59:36] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Wipeout is great
[5:59:36] <%hereiam407> Very amazing game
[5:59:36] <+DatAsuna> But it's still eh
[5:59:40] <dds333a> WipEout too fucking good

[5:59:54] <nailwind> bo'om geeh
[5:59:56] <%Dapper_Cactuar> if only Split Second's steam port didn't have its multiplayer patched out and made single player only
[5:59:59] <majindusto> Nintendo  will never allow  a new F-Zero :(
[6:00:00] <AngryAsian5> Bruh
[6:00:01] <UncleMcgoo> ah jeez
