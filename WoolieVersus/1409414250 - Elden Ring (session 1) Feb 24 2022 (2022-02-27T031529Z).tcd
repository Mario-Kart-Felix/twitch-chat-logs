[0:10:06] <KeiganOfAstora> Could be a little louder
[0:10:06] <+thebowie88> Not too bad, but a bit quiet
[0:10:06] <+Dariel111> turn it up a little
[0:10:07] <+cubbywolf> it seems balanced to me
[0:10:07] <Duriel56> its quite loud

[0:10:29] <%hax_metatron> This theme is currently the only good thing in this entire stupid world btw
[0:10:31] <roz_en> This title theme goes hard
[0:10:32] <kazadaz> Nice even volume for me

[0:39:11] <+anoldtoilet> @T_Sasquatch YES i love it and im hype for it.
[0:39:11] <Jaxnos> i know the options are still wanting, but i feel like we're not giving this enough credit. that is a realistic human with darker skin tone i'm looking at in a Souls game by Fromsoft. what i'm seeing right now on screen is outright impossible in all of their other games.
[0:39:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now you can make a white tatto
[0:39:22] <+anoldtoilet> give me Woolie wandering around doing nothing for 200 eps
[0:39:24] <%andre11dr> Where's, the Berserk brand?
[0:39:31] <%adamisbarely3d> do the tats have texture to them? bc if so that's pretty cool
[0:39:41] <+ds3namecaldara> Three steps forward 2 back the Fromsoft way
[0:39:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Go White Ink tattoo

[0:40:02] <%Reveresao> @jaxnos nag hair options more important
[0:40:07] <dundore77> i mean tattoos can be whatever color you want
[0:40:09] <smamgotdam> @Jaxnos check out demon souls remake's options, then compare to the lack of non-white templates in this game
[0:40:12] <%BartOctane> George "If you want to be the hero, your melanin must be zero" Martin

[0:41:19] <Jaxnos> and i don't feel like this is a goalpost move for me because i'm comparing it to their other games, not the industry as a whole.

[0:52:07] <Hydrapissed> ya gata block an attack first then attack
[0:52:08] <%ArtemisCroc> no, the counter is when you block an attack
[0:52:09] <cheapdoc> The lab is OPEN
[0:52:10] <gespenstkick> You have to blovk a hit for that
[0:52:22] <ashenjuan25> Magic time y’all let the laming it out begin
[0:52:23] <%andre11dr> You gotta block first ,it's like a Alpha counter
[0:52:24] <+ds3namecaldara> summon up to two daggers at a time
[0:52:26] <bradley1990> Dark Souls 3.1 looks neat
[0:52:32] <%adamisbarely3d> literal first room: Woolie "is this a lab?"
[0:52:42] <+anoldtoilet> lool
[0:52:43] <%joker626> joker626 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Woolie, hope you and reggie have a good one and you don't get caught sleeping too hard
[0:52:48] <+anoldtoilet> you gotta know the moveset
[0:52:54] <+ds3namecaldara> may as well lame out boss Numero uno
[0:52:56] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus you have to block an attack then heavy
[0:53:00] <+anoldtoilet> x\
[0:53:04] <ashenjuan25> @bradley1990 Um it’s actually king’s field 11 you know
[0:53:08] <MinersLoveGames> The fact that the prisoner starts with an estoc of all weapons totally makes his a reference to Griffith, right?
[0:53:26] <ultrabonezone> OH you can't change the prompt?
[0:53:32] <dundore77> i thought steam detects play station controllers and uses those prompts?
[0:53:33] <foghornleghorn55> oh no dual sense support :(
[0:53:35] <bradley1990> @ashenjuan25 why you gotta expose me a casul like that? cmon now
[0:53:50] <DSD24> @MinersLoveGames The backstory is that the Prisoner was Royalty before they got the mask
[0:53:54] <%kyh9> IM WATCHING THREE PEOPLE PLAY ELDEN RING AT THE SAME TIME
[0:54:12] <Vaunno> @kyh9 WAYTOODANK
[0:54:17] <MinersLoveGames> @DSD24 yep, that answers that
[0:54:27] <+anoldtoilet> NO SKILL
[0:54:31] <ashenjuan25> @bradley1990 could be worse, you could think ds2 is actually good
[0:54:32] <+ds3namecaldara> God don't look at anyone else they've been playing too long
[0:54:57] <masterfire23> you can change some visual prompts in the settings in sound I believe
[0:55:00] <iacus_> ds2 is amazing. The real understand
[0:55:00] <+Order_of_Mystery> Reggie is gonna love the spellsword options
[0:55:02] <definitelynotjayy> yoooo reggie vs onion ring lets go
[0:55:06] <MinersLoveGames> Plan on going with the Confessor, once I get my rig fixed up and upgraded, hopefully soon. Really like going the battle mage route.
[0:55:26] <+Vigonept> the shielf buffs
[0:55:27] <+Grayhammatter> it is woolie vs elden ring, not reggie
[0:55:29] <ashenjuan25> You’re right the only bad things ds2 had was the agility stat
[0:55:29] <DSD24> I'm gonna go Wretch
[0:55:32] <+anoldtoilet> oh 2handing is like a hold and select thing now
[0:55:32] <ashenjuan25> And the hit boxes
[0:55:33] <stuffamiriteyea> it gives you a status?
[0:55:34] <+anoldtoilet> iirc
[0:55:40] <ashenjuan25> And the infinite overhead tracking
[0:55:45] <%pi_in_the_sci> other way around, the shield gives you resistences
[0:55:46] <ashenjuan25> And the spiteful level design
[0:55:53] <ashenjuan25> And the floaty movement
[0:55:55] <definitelynotjayy> @grayhammatter thats what they want you to think ; )
[0:55:58] <vVAstrAVv> mo the shield is RAISING those resistances
[0:56:08] <%セビー> some shields as far back as ds1 did stuff to resist bars
[0:56:09] <+anoldtoilet> ds2 has a lot of interesting and cool stuff too
[0:56:18] <ashenjuan25> Yeah but it’s not fun to play
[0:56:19] <+anoldtoilet> but yeah its very hostile to the player, more than any other game in the series
[0:56:21] <+anoldtoilet> yeah
[0:56:26] <MinersLoveGames> I'll defend DS2 to my dying day. A lot I really enjoy with that game.
[0:56:37] <+anoldtoilet> its like, never trying to be a "fun" challenge, ds2 is constantly trying to kick you in the nuts
[0:56:51] <ashenjuan25> Ds2 is so bad they literally had to redesign the game for it to be good
[0:56:54] <+anoldtoilet> and go haha, you thought i wouldnt kick you in the nuts?
[0:56:59] <+anoldtoilet> i think the redesign is worse
[0:57:08] <+anoldtoilet> well like ds2 its better in some ways
[0:57:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19
[0:57:09] <+anoldtoilet> and cool
[0:57:13] <+anoldtoilet> but also its bad in others
[0:57:15] <R3c0n31> Oh yea he hasnt gone through DS3 yet so this system is all new
[0:57:21] <MinersLoveGames> Agree to disagree on the matter when it comes to DS2. I enjoy it.
[0:57:21] <%セビー> sotfs is.. it has ups and downs
[0:57:24] <hereiam407> sip sip
[0:57:31] <%joker626> ngl. I just wonder how nonsense the swamp gonna be in this game
[0:57:32] <ashenjuan25> Ds2 is a caricature of what people assume the souls is, difficult for difficulty’s sake
[0:57:48] <Jrocy247> Griffith's mask
[0:57:48] <jbrachob> GRIFFFFIIIIITTTTTSS
[0:57:54] <+queuecumber555> I still really like DS2, it’s got it’s charms
[0:57:54] <Iam_Dead> DS2 is def my favorite, because you have so many options if you get frustrated or stuck. sans the dlc stuff.
[0:57:55] <+Vigonept> those masks were real btw
[0:57:56] <MinersLoveGames> It really is.
[0:57:57] <+pectusumbra> And you start with a Rapier, it's Griffith as fuck
[0:58:00] <+Vigonept> they existed
[0:58:01] <Ner234> Ew
[0:58:03] <R3c0n31> I like DS2 but those damage numbers on DS2 hurt alot
[0:58:03] <dukenux> DansGame
[0:58:03] <+678saintglock> sotfs was still fun to my 12 year old self
[0:58:08] <+hypethefool> man in the iron mask

[0:58:12] <+delilah4you> yum
[0:58:12] <dukenux> the curse of stank
[0:58:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE TIME HAS COME
[0:58:14] <+anoldtoilet> its difficult in ways you cant possibly try to predict or expect either. the amount of "gotcha" deaths in that game that you have no real warning for other than "i died to this once already" is wild
[0:58:14] <%livlinn> Eww
[0:58:14] <+Grayhammatter> STANK
[0:58:15] <+Kawaso> LUL
[0:58:15] <lockhead45> Time to enjoy Snail Ring!!!
[0:58:16] <%Irridium> shit-stained pants
[0:58:17] <+MooseIsGoose> He got that con funk
[0:58:17] <DSD24> Woolsorth was into NFTs
[0:58:18] <LoneFonte> uh oh
[0:58:18] <ashenjuan25> Hell the intro of the game even emphasize that it’s just designed to say fuck the player with how the old women laugh at the idea you’ll die over and over again
[0:58:19] <Ner234> ! STANK !
[0:58:21] <%AngryAsian5> sewage pants
[0:58:23] <+anoldtoilet> yeah lol
[0:58:25] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[0:58:26] <2deep5u> smell so stink
[0:58:28] <dds333a> @678saintglock oh boy LUL
[0:58:33] <+anoldtoilet> its an interesting game. a lot about it is really cool
[0:58:34] <dukenux> extra motivation to find drip
[0:58:35] <%Seancicle> gotta jet. cul8r PrideShrug
[0:58:36] <2deep5u> like the krubor juice
[0:58:36] <+anoldtoilet> but i didnt have fun with it
[0:58:47] <+queuecumber555> Gross icky criminal man
[0:58:54] <MinersLoveGames> I'll die on the hill of DS2 being a good game.
[0:58:58] <ashenjuan25> I think ds2 fans have a severe case of Stockholm syndrome
[0:58:59] <santietch> whats the difference between int and arcane when it comes to magic????
[0:59:02] <+generalve> @WoolieVersus any performance drops ?
[0:59:04] <%adamisbarely3d> Woolington IV, called Stank-Ass
[0:59:10] <kadjah> @minerslovegames then perish
[0:59:16] <+678saintglock> @dds333a what
[0:59:25] <sirrice77> arcane is basically luck
[0:59:25] <%ArtemisCroc> @ashenjuan25 no, it's just a better game than DS3 lmao
[0:59:29] <ashenjuan25> Ds2 fans are in abusive relationship with someone they insist they can fix
[0:59:37] <+anoldtoilet> @santietch arcane is like a weird luck stat
[0:59:43] <shinbarney> Mundane santiers spear goes crazy tho
[0:59:47] <+anoldtoilet> bleed magic, poison effects, dragon stuff
[0:59:51] <MinersLoveGames> @ashenjuan25 or just enjoy for how it is? warts and all?
[1:00:00] <rommlll> now this, this is thorough
[1:00:04] <ashenjuan25> Hey at least DS3 plays like a souls game and not a souls like
[1:00:05] <dds333a> @678saintglock just the thought that you were goddamn 12 when you played SOTFS, it made me feel older LUL
[1:00:05] <%pi_in_the_sci> Arcane is both luck and bloodborne arcane
[1:00:07] <maskedmustelid> faith/arc spell schools?
[1:00:07] <%セビー> nah, ds2 fans accept the game as it is, and dont need it to be the others
[1:00:07] <Jaxnos> This joke is for FF14 people: DS2 is Stormblood.
[1:00:10] <Memitim> you can hit start for a detailed description for everything
[1:00:12] <it_came_from_outer_space> @WoolieVersus I have heard tell that getting arcane to 10 is good for item discovery
[1:00:20] <+anoldtoilet> @ashenjuan25 yeah i get why people like it even though it wasnt for me
[1:00:28] <TitaniaGrowing> My Elden Ring Copy crashes on start did you have to deal with that?
[1:00:28] <+anoldtoilet> its got a LOT of cool stuff
[1:00:29] <foghornleghorn55> why are we still having ds2 debate😂😂
[1:00:30] <+Javaa01> @ashenjuan25 Literally "I can fix them" -Person who is even worse
[1:00:30] <dundore77> wheres the adaptability stat?
[1:00:34] <masterfire23> PotFriend
[1:00:35] <+678saintglock> @dds333a lmao yeah imagine, i’m 20 now
[1:00:41] <MinersLoveGames> here we are getting into a fucking argument over the souls series while Woolie explains the rest of the souls series to Reggie in the meantime lmao.
[1:00:46] <+anoldtoilet> its actually trying to do different stuff and be more of a puzzle adventure game i feel
[1:00:52] <ashenjuan25> “I can fix them I just need to level up my agility stat.”
[1:00:59] <DSD24> @MinersLoveGames Hey man we gotta fill some content right now
[1:01:02] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:01:03] <%pi_in_the_sci> You can also highlight the stats for an explaination
[1:01:06] <MrDrayko> alright, I'm in game, best of luck to the boys and chat <3
[1:01:06] <MinersLoveGames> Agreed.
[1:01:06] <+anoldtoilet> its fun talking about it imo
[1:01:11] <+Vigonept> its the shield aint it?
[1:01:18] <%radiorosewater> DS2 was eight years ago. Relax. There are much greater problems in this world than your favorite video game.
[1:01:22] <Memitim> it's the shield
[1:01:23] <+Grayhammatter> pretty sure it's the shield yes
[1:01:31] <%セビー> is the argument “i like ds2” being countered by “youre wrong”?
[1:01:33] <+Jiggisnipe> @foghornleghorn55 cuz DS2 killed their parents or something. ER is out and people are talking about an 8 yr old game
[1:01:43] <Carlioo> @セビー seems like
[1:01:53] <TonberryLives> @セビー That is exactly what it is
[1:02:02] <MinersLoveGames> I enjoy all the Souls game. Gonna enjoy Elden Ring too. Once I get my PC upgraded, that is.
[1:02:10] <+Walopoh> aww I was hoping to come back and you'd still be in character creator LUL
[1:02:17] <ashenjuan25> You’re right ds2 killed my dog and won’t let it stand until I get my revenge
[1:02:20] <+Walopoh> close enough
[1:02:21] <brunoberserk> the menus in this game looks CLEAN AS F
[1:02:21] <dundore77> might be a steam option
[1:02:28] <R3c0n31> elden Ring supports Xbox confirmed
[1:02:33] <@Solidus_113> button settings
[1:02:36] <+anoldtoilet> i really liked that port area in ds2
[1:02:39] <Darmanimon> someone whisper me once they leave this room
[1:02:44] <+anoldtoilet> with the monsters that were afraid of fire
[1:02:46] <+generalve> how is performance
[1:02:47] <+anoldtoilet> and the guys w oil flasks
[1:02:48] <%セビー> i plat’d all 3 dark souls, i liked them all for their own qualities
[1:02:54] <+anoldtoilet> probably my favorite area i got to in that game
[1:02:56] <+NecDW4> @WoolieVersus Check advanced graphics, sometimes UI elements get hiden in places like that
[1:02:57] <masterfire23> i think it's in sound
[1:02:59] <MinersLoveGames> @セビー MY man!
[1:03:05] <maskedmustelid> xbox red ring of death now elden ring of death?
[1:03:06] <+Jiggisnipe> is this the lab? :o
[1:03:06] <CapCasual> @WoolieVersus You m ight be able to change it in the steam settings for the game.
[1:03:08] <+ds3namecaldara> I bet the Pre order gesture let's you do something earlier than normal
[1:03:16] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:03:16] <Carlioo> O
[1:03:17] <maskedmustelid> praise the ring!
[1:03:18] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:03:19] <LoneFonte> O

[1:03:32] <%セビー> O
[1:03:33] <+678saintglock> i liked the room full of exploding guys
[1:03:33] <MinersLoveGames> It's fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A!
[1:03:33] <Jaxnos> something something make contact
[1:03:36] <@Solidus_113> you can change that
[1:03:36] <kinkade_77> So we went for Griffith huh
[1:03:42] <R3c0n31> Welcome to the life of Jumping Woolie
[1:03:47] <Parapattern> Y O and L
[1:03:49] <+Jiggisnipe> oh can you change buttons?
[1:03:53] <%Deosier> yes
[1:04:02] <Pookiedaexzile> If Griffith and caska Switched Places in the story
[1:04:24] <ashenjuan25> Jokes aside ds2 is a fine game but I feel it gets a lot about what I enjoyed in dark souls 1 wrong including gameplay, level design, enemy and boss design, and lacked the ambiguity of ds1 in the writing that it’s my least favorite in the series and will grant ds2 being an 7 in a sea of 9s isn’t its fault
[1:04:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:04:48] <cheapdoc> CYCLE
[1:04:48] <+ds3namecaldara> Path of the dragon, make contact, maybe
[1:04:52] <%adamisbarely3d> I had a similar problem with DS1 on Switch. they made B confirm!
[1:05:17] <brunoberserk> ELDEN LORD ?  i lke the sound of that
[1:05:17] <+MamoruTheRed> it's gonna take some doing to remember triangle as confirm
[1:05:21] <MinersLoveGames> @ashenjuan25 I can agree to that. I found the story of DS2, especially SOTFS to be extremely compelling, however.
[1:05:24] <maskedmustelid> tracking!
[1:05:29] <MrBorisMakarov> summoned swords?
[1:05:30] <+Vigonept> Summon swords
[1:05:47] <+Grayhammatter> summoned swords yeyeye
[1:05:51] <rommlll> summon stoc
[1:05:52] <+MamoruTheRed> welp, woolie will know be Virgil and I don't blame him
[1:06:00] <+MamoruTheRed> now*
[1:06:14] <+anoldtoilet> yeah its completely different but i think they were trying to do that and make it feel very different. it reminded me almost of like a sierra adventure game
[1:06:22] <+anoldtoilet> like a really nihilistic quest for glory
[1:06:24] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:06:26] <vVAstrAVv> is this still the first room
[1:06:27] <ashenjuan25> DS2’s story just feels like it’s using 10 more words to do what dark souls 1 did in 5 and something about that just felt too on the nose for my liking
[1:06:28] <%セビー> we need to demand a unified confirm/cancel button setting between platforms and regions
[1:06:38] <+Grayhammatter> 1
[1:06:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ironic
[1:06:39] <whiteblacklight74> only one talisman ever
[1:06:40] <%pi_in_the_sci> talisman is ring
[1:06:41] <+MooseIsGoose> no rings allowed
[1:06:43] <+Grayhammatter> everybody gets 1
[1:06:47] <styptysat> No more drip D:
[1:06:51] <LoneFonte> i guess you only need 1 ring...
[1:06:54] <+anoldtoilet> there might be more slots eventually but i dont know
[1:06:56] <+anoldtoilet> i hope
[1:06:56] <%Irridium> Elden No Rings
[1:06:59] <+nanaki_ff14> Only need the Elden Ring
[1:07:00] <whiteblacklight74> there is only one ring in the game
[1:07:10] <maskedmustelid> one ring to rule them all
[1:07:11] <dukenux> NFT man
[1:07:14] <%pi_in_the_sci> Though the slot is called "talisman 1" so I assume you'll be able to equip more eventually
[1:07:15] <MadBaller123> Eldens's Ring's
[1:07:19] <LoneFonte> OH
[1:07:22] <whiteblacklight74> street fighter nft
[1:07:22] <+Walopoh> this game looks neat, what's it called?
[1:07:24] <+Grayhammatter> oh, cool
[1:07:25] <andrei1h1> rings are too important in the lore to have them as normal items I guess
[1:07:30] <+anoldtoilet> @pi_in_the_sci yeah this is why i think there might be more
[1:07:43] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus hitting the triggers in the sub menu is how you 2 hand
[1:07:49] <whiteblacklight74> @Walopoh Elden Talisman
[1:07:52] <stuffamiriteyea> right side main menu?
[1:08:01] <@Solidus_113> pouch far right side
[1:08:03] <Memitim> right side of the start menu
[1:08:14] <%セビー> woolie will figure it out.. eventually
[1:08:16] <+Grayhammatter> cool
[1:08:17] <MinersLoveGames> Memory Of Grace basically this game's answer to the Darksign.
[1:08:19] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> Right side
[1:08:31] <atomizedstream> @woolieversus i believe holding triangle and tapping R1 or L1 is how you two hand
[1:08:34] <+anoldtoilet> oh i like this pouch idea
[1:08:38] <LoneFonte> so like the bloodborne quick item menu, that's great
[1:08:38] <iacus_> an actually quick quick belt. nice
[1:08:54] <kazadaz> I have never written a Souls message
[1:08:58] <%セビー> wooliePOYO
[1:09:04] <%pi_in_the_sci> and you can two hand the shield as well
[1:09:08] <%illicitdonut> illicitdonut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Only the most Elden of Rings!
[1:09:12] <stuffamiriteyea> yes
[1:09:21] <MinersLoveGames> thouse sounds are crisp
[1:09:24] <+Vigonept> aw fuck its an estoc
[1:09:28] <%pi_in_the_sci> jump attack?
[1:09:31] <stuffamiriteyea> infinite sprint
[1:09:40] <the_ugliest_known> Wooow not the build I was expecting
[1:09:42] <+Grayhammatter> parrying shield for sure
[1:09:43] <maskedmustelid> sprintfinite
[1:09:43] <ashenjuan25> Can you do the forward r1 for the estoc
[1:09:44] <+twohitgood> it's a party shield.
[1:09:46] <R3c0n31> The threaten of life is what effects ones stamina
[1:09:48] <the_ugliest_known> Or character rather
[1:09:49] <%セビー> Im suspicious of infinite sprint
[1:10:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Bets on how long till Death
[1:10:12] <+allups> that was red tho
[1:10:21] <ashenjuan25> I think I saw something where to do the forward r1s for some weapons you have to charge a heavy attack and then dodge to do it
[1:10:27] <AvroEltz> oh, i know exactly where the first death is
[1:10:31] <HiroProtagonest> Those look like red bloodstains to me
[1:10:32] <+Flunkorg> woolie I think your colours are screwed because thats definitly red for us
[1:10:35] <MrBorisMakarov> looks like it's broken right now? it happened in ds3 sometimes
[1:10:37] <Darmanimon> we are forever trapped in this room
[1:10:46] <iacus_> edging us
[1:10:50] <+678saintglock> think he's talking about the phantoms

[1:25:56] <Nyx_Auralia> THERE'S A JUMP?!?
[1:26:02] <R3c0n31> Of course
[1:26:04] <velgaduere> imagine if fall damage was such that you took it if you simply jumped
[1:26:27] <velgaduere> which, now that I think about it, is a thing in real life for some people
[1:26:39] <ScreamLord> How do you two hand you right-handed weapon? I'm starting the game as a Samurai and the usual method doesn't work
[1:26:40] <+Javaa01> @velgaduere Yeah thank god they never made a game like that before
[1:26:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @velgaduere also witcher 3 Kappa
[1:26:54] <+Grayhammatter> so much cook time
[1:26:56] <seainspace> yeah but it homes

[1:27:00] <velgaduere> oh god, GTA5 flashbacks
[1:27:02] <+MooseIsGoose> Its like you are setting a trap with that spell
[1:27:08] <velgaduere> you step wrong in that game and you die
[1:27:15] <ashenjuan25> Let the laming out begin
[1:27:17] <Sternieliscious> I really hope that the jump move allows Red Hot Kick for fist weapons. Just play souls with Beowulf.
[1:27:17] <%セビー> @screamlord think it was hold triangle and r1

[1:28:06] <maskedmustelid> stance dance?
[1:28:20] <ScreamLord> @セビー So Y and R1 for me on PC then. Thanks, I'll check when Woolie's done streaming
[1:28:23] <%CatRidder> stands
[1:29:08] <ashenjuan25> Apparently stance in this game is like posture in sekiro but rewards heavy attacks to break their stances and then go in for a repost
[1:29:16] <%セビー> @screamlord yeah, hold for submenu then tap rb, or lb, to two hand

[1:57:27] <it_came_from_outer_space> its true grrm is the sole dev of this game, mildly impressive tbh

[1:58:51] <%bruuzer12> that's a new thing
[1:58:58] <ashenjuan25> You know George is a pretty smart and snarky dude I bet you anything he didn’t call this dark souls 4 because he’s old but because he’s throwing mild shade
[1:58:59] <dundore77> "we see you are using adblocker"

[1:59:20] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 Boy, are U one of the biggest Plague fan boys? Cos u come across as bitter as fucking vinegar my dude
[1:59:20] <+InfernalDante> With all the hype behind this game I wanna try it, but I’m AWFUL at Souls games
[1:59:31] <dds333a> @ashenjuan25 LUL LUL
[1:59:45] <dds333a> @ashenjuan25 not even wrong
[2:00:24] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 those last two comments are pretty funny and possibly true though
[2:00:24] <+Crippl3> george rr martin doesn't know a fucking thing about dark souls, it isn't some backhanded burn
[2:00:48] <ashenjuan25> Nah plague has brain rot that doesn’t gel with my brain rot and like I said I don’t hate magic outright I just find projectile casting boring as fuck and makes it so you don’t have to actually engage with the combat and let’s be honest no one likes a zoner
[2:00:53] <%jonblnt> The references
[2:00:54] <LoneFonte> fallen from the sky : 👁️ 👁️

[2:02:26] <%adamisbarely3d> zangief
[2:02:37] <trilmonte> There's a lot going with this game comparative to previous Souls iterations.
[2:02:39] <it_came_from_outer_space> Elden master chef
[2:02:40] <+Jiggisnipe> @tangowulf I heard it's mainly the lore and world-buidling
[2:02:51] <trilmonte> I don't know anything about G.R.R. Martin, but I know Berserk.
[2:02:57] <ashenjuan25> Hey if more magic was summonable greatswords you use to fuck up people around I’m here for it but if it’s just flinging summon swords at people that’s boring as shit
[2:03:00] <trilmonte> There's a big Berserk in the background of this area.
[2:03:11] <+Grayhammatter> here we go
[2:03:12] <dds333a> @jiggisnipe I never expected too much myself. but seems like more too

[2:06:13] <+678saintglock> my only concern is not knowing where to find the drip in this game

[2:06:17] <Nyx_Auralia> can you eat the animals tho??
[2:06:20] <%DkLordG> did woolie check out the note he bought?

[2:08:27] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 I get your point about projectiles. But I'm just happy that this is the most powerful and viable magic has been since DeS, and I don't doubt that there is 100% going to a bunch of close-range spells
[2:08:28] <dds333a> I don't think she made the switch that long ago anyway

[2:25:39] <+hoenhime344> they were all facing the circle
[2:25:50] <XScytheMata> we are not into those kinks

[2:25:55] <trilmonte> #FeelsBadMan
[2:25:56] <+hoenhime344> so im guessing they attack when woolie touches circle
[2:25:59] <xxHungryxx> thats what they get for standing there, minding their business

[2:27:41] <Nikbottom> I wonder why he’s in jail?
[2:27:48] <%AllenDeadman> you cna just go at it
[2:27:48] <Nyx_Auralia> yeah, this is the dancer mechanics...
[2:27:50] <alexandrecau> smiling knight
[2:27:51] <it_came_from_outer_space> seemed doable tbh
[2:27:55] <it_came_from_outer_space> damage was fine
[2:27:57] <dds333a> Up to you to go to prison
[2:27:57] <%jonblnt> How are the loading times?
[2:27:58] <sirtommygunn> how nice
[2:28:01] <%pi_in_the_sci> It doesn't give you the option of a stake unless you died close to it
[2:28:03] <LunarRemix> You can totally do it
[2:28:06] <guffbud> Statue icon appears under health when one is near
[2:28:06] <+Jiggisnipe> I believe in Woolie
[2:28:06] <trilmonte> Nobody move, there's souls on the floor.
[2:28:06] <neet98> doable
[2:28:16] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> Dollar store artorias. Still cool though
[2:28:22] <+OrangeMDT> Just always assume Marika is closer
[2:28:29] <XScytheMata> the coconut worms are okay, yay
[2:28:29] <T_Sasquatch> i get the dancer vibes tbh
[2:28:31] <trilmonte> And I can't find my spark.
[2:28:31] <%jonblnt> I love that evergaol runes feature
[2:28:36] <ashenjuan25> The whole glowing tree motif is hitting just right
[2:28:44] <%townzzzzz> SPEED
[2:28:44] <%セビー> yeah, that flip was artorias, with dancer aesthetics

[2:29:37] <%セビー> right right.. reminds us of berserk..
[2:29:53] <AvroEltz> yeah, pat had some trouble with this boss
[2:29:55] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 It really does. From soft really knows how to make sick art designs
[2:30:11] <XScytheMata> that was weird LUL
[2:30:14] <it_came_from_outer_space> darn
[2:30:14] <ashenjuan25> Reminds me of Tolkien shit
[2:30:14] <+OrangeMDT> Did Woolie fight the tree? Just came from Pat
[2:30:28] <%andre11dr> @jonblnt Well, he's attempting it before even unlocking leveling, so it's quite a challenge
[2:30:29] <masterfire23> @orangemdt no
[2:30:32] <dds333a> cross CUT
[2:30:37] <%radiorosewater> @OrangeMDT Nope.

[2:30:58] <Nikbottom> Remember the name
[2:31:02] <+Grayhammatter> bloodhound knight darrell
[2:31:06] <Memitim> @orangemdt If you ever think you want to say "Did ___ fight the ___" just keep it to yourself.
[2:31:12] <jvilly96> Looks like the hound version of Guts
[2:31:13] <+Crippl3> bloodhound gang darrawil
[2:31:14] <+OrangeMDT> That’s awesome, can’t wait to see Woolie handle that
[2:31:16] <xxHungryxx> "What's that smell? IT'S BLOOOD"
[2:31:23] <Shiibbae> @orangemdt just started the playthrough
[2:31:29] <ashenjuan25> I’m hyped for the Tolkien like mythic stuff because both GRRM and Miyazaki fuck hard with inverting Tolkien tropes

[2:31:45] <w_khan> oh cool the ice knight

[2:33:17] <ashenjuan25> Sekiro this mother fuckery
[2:33:23] <Nikbottom> I will always forget jumping
[2:33:26] <%andre11dr> So the game never tells you this, but the jump has iframes on startup
[2:33:32] <it_came_from_outer_space> oh yea the jump has i-frames if I remember correctly
[2:33:36] <trilmonte> That magic went full stormtrooper

[2:34:02] <Pookiedaexzile> You have to hit him woolie
[2:34:04] <dds333a> That's amazing
[2:34:25] <ashenjuan25> woolieF
[2:34:37] <%andre11dr> At least that's how it was in the beta ,i don't think they'd change it
[2:34:59] <dds333a> Prison Fight Club LUL
[2:35:12] <+AnthraxJohnson> FBPass
[2:35:19] <dds333a> @andre11dr Fair, I really hope it retained
[2:35:44] <it_came_from_outer_space> Ok maybe level ur vit a bit first to make it a fairer fight
[2:35:49] <TonberryLives> Fair attempt
[2:35:56] <+Vigonept> you can parry like 50% of bosses in ds3
[2:36:03] <%radiorosewater> @WoolieVersus he is!
[2:36:07] <+hoenhime344> the magic was working well
[2:36:08] <+johnny_scissors> Some bosses are parryable, worth trying
[2:36:09] <redgunnit> souls logic says you can parry bosses
[2:36:28] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 Dark fantasy just allows you to go wild with inversions and subversions of all kinds
[2:36:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:36:31] <redgunnit> as long as they are human bodied
[2:36:57] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> He is able to be parried. It’s actually REALLY effective.
[2:37:00] <%jonblnt> Do the eyeballs marks the barrier to the boss fight?
[2:37:10] <+hoenhime344> get caught in treeeeeees
[2:37:15] <seainspace> might be worth to you know, at least unlock the basics before you go boss hunting
[2:37:28] <neet98> he is brutal
[2:37:36] <T_Sasquatch> nah just do it
[2:37:39] <dds333a> yo, the bitch test LUL
[2:37:42] <+hoenhime344> nah just do it though
[2:37:43] <+skyshinecrusader> parry time.
[2:37:43] <Pookiedaexzile> We still have no Horse
[2:37:48] <trilmonte> That music sounded distorted and scary. I love it.
[2:37:49] <%andre11dr> Wait can you parry bosses in DS2? i never tried it cause parrying is weird in DS2
[2:38:01] <+Jiggisnipe> oof
[2:38:07] <+Jiggisnipe> that's a combo
[2:38:13] <TonberryLives> SICK
[2:38:26] <trilmonte> Wombeaux Combeaux
[2:38:29] <%jonblnt> Jump attacks to stagger him
[2:38:31] <HR_Freud> he's some kinda speedy moleman
[2:38:52] <+healnavi> is this why it's called the evergaol
[2:39:00] <+hoenhime344> hes Vort, but got shinigammi training
[2:39:01] <AvroEltz> maybe you need some grinding off scren
[2:39:03] <%radiorosewater> real farron knight vibes
[2:39:12] <neet98> i wonder if boses have like anti-air grab to deal with jumping
[2:39:22] <trilmonte> That sounds terrifying.
[2:39:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Maybe use your Dexterity
[2:39:26] <+AnthraxJohnson> Pro tip: Tug on his wiener to stagger him
[2:39:29] <+hoenhime344> magiiiiic
[2:39:31] <MadBaller123> its weird getting used to jumping after so many games without it
[2:39:32] <T_Sasquatch> backseat no jutsu
[2:39:37] <trilmonte> Bosses with anti-air.
[2:39:39] <seainspace> wrecked
[2:39:41] <%notsoy> welp
[2:39:41] <redgunnit> good plan
[2:39:45] <%andre11dr> I mean, you haven't even unlocked all game mechanics yet ,so yeah, maybe come back later LUL
[2:39:46] <redgunnit> worked well
[2:39:52] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie you gotta give em the ole dicktwist
[2:39:54] <+hoenhime344> nah just do it
[2:39:59] <jubejube56> I can tell that this boss is inspired by game of thrones
[2:40:01] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[2:40:04] <%jonblnt> Practice and then level up
[2:40:08] <HR_Freud> smack his nuts
[2:40:09] <redgunnit> if i was playing, i would simply win
[2:40:18] <atomizedstream> we've got some real boys out in these fields
[2:40:18] <+hoenhime344> punch his penis
[2:40:21] <+OrangeMDT> Yeah, the biggest issues are not having a 100% phys shield and not knowing what to parry (which is understandable)
[2:40:23] <+Damie904> @hoenhime344 Na, first stream cant be running one boss all day. lol
[2:40:24] <dds333a> @redgunnit based, same here
[2:40:31] <+RedMaskBandit> my man is glowing rn
[2:40:35] <it_came_from_outer_space> He definitely can tho
[2:40:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> if he wants to
[2:40:55] <%andre11dr> Just bite the boss ,it will probably infect it with toxic
[2:40:59] <HR_Freud> he's covered in a fine mystic glaze
[2:40:59] <neet98> his moveset is sick though
[2:41:02] <+hoenhime344> @hoenhime344 nah, but do it though
[2:41:19] <+RedMaskBandit> wait who is playing? is it Wools or Reggia?
[2:41:19] <it_came_from_outer_space> This guy is real quick
[2:41:22] <+hoenhime344> it will be GREAT content for the podcast
[2:41:27] <dds333a> Woolz
[2:41:29] <%notsoy> woolie is the one playing
[2:41:33] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> No boss damage.
[2:41:34] <+Jiggisnipe> oooo coool
[2:41:37] <zhenthrim213> LOOK AT THT GUY
[2:41:44] <%jonblnt> Hellooooo Guts
[2:41:55] <foghornleghorn55> Totally not Guts
[2:41:55] <dds333a> @susyosanchez just a little bit
[2:42:02] <dds333a> He did touch him
[2:42:08] <%andre11dr> Just saying, the Tarnished, not washing those teeth, getting bit by them would probably be awful
[2:42:09] <+RedMaskBandit> will he do his own private password community?
[2:42:17] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Magic works!
[2:42:27] <neet98> they really just put these checkpoint statues for people to throw themselves at these bosses as fast as possible
[2:42:27] <+hoenhime344> magic seems REALLY good
[2:42:38] <seainspace> that third swing just eats that healthbar
[2:42:43] <+hoenhime344> that was a COOL animation
[2:42:47] <Makr0ss> go frog knight
[2:43:02] <it_came_from_outer_space> The chip damage is killer
[2:43:12] <%radiorosewater> @WoolieVersus his second low swing can be parried after blocking the first, it's sort of reliable. I'll shut up now <3
[2:43:15] <%jonblnt> Good try
[2:43:33] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> You got this
[2:43:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:43:36] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Mabey try a REAL shield.
[2:43:45] <+Jiggisnipe> I believe
[2:43:55] <+hoenhime344> @SUSYOSANCHEZ agreed
[2:43:56] <%andre11dr> I don't believe
[2:43:58] <seainspace> he hasn't got a real shield
[2:44:15] <it_came_from_outer_space> nah I believe
[2:44:19] <+eanscrale> At least it's not engendering passivity
[2:44:20] <%andre11dr> Because guess what, there might be a phase 2 LUL
[2:44:23] <it_came_from_outer_space> hard tho
[2:44:37] <+hoenhime344> @andre11dr aaaahahhahahah god i hope
[2:44:55] <Makr0ss> cool sword tho
[2:44:56] <seainspace> "don't get greedy" says the guy bossrushing not even out of the tutrorial
[2:45:10] <+hoenhime344> woolie also has FP moves... that thrust is a real one
[2:45:44] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> New idea, spam magic!
[2:45:50] <+hoenhime344> ^
[2:45:55] <+tetraes> dodge roll?
[2:46:00] <+Vigonept> has this guy killed woolie more than artorias
[2:46:00] <+MooseIsGoose> This is doable it looks like
[2:46:05] <+Ryaotz> can you parry?
[2:46:06] <HR_Freud> just don't get hit
[2:46:08] <Jrocy247> I know this may be a bit early to speak about, but how DLCs do you guys think this game's gonna get?

[2:46:18] <+Vigonept> SPAM MAGIC
[2:46:30] <it_came_from_outer_space> @Jrocy247 literally no idea
[2:46:32] <%andre11dr> Damn ,that dose damage, just spam it
[2:46:34] <ashenjuan25> Lame it out
[2:46:47] <ashenjuan25> Like a cool guy
[2:46:48] <%andre11dr> Like its Cross Tekken
[2:47:02] <it_came_from_outer_space> blood loss btw
[2:47:10] <Jrocy247> I'm gonna take a chance and say 2-3 DLCs. Hope they don't just leave it with the base game.
[2:47:16] <%CatRidder> you need to lab it
[2:47:20] <+hoenhime344> he hit him 3 times with magic and brought him down 40 %
[2:47:23] <zhenthrim213> "i like the way you bleed"
[2:47:29] <it_came_from_outer_space> Its like an 80 hour game lol
[2:47:35] <it_came_from_outer_space> just beat it first maybe
[2:47:37] <dds333a> @jrocy247 if it comes to DLC, I hope they do
[2:47:44] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Basement boss is sweaty!
[2:47:46] <T_Sasquatch> woolie will figure it out
[2:47:51] <+nochejunior> can you level up and come back later or u have to beat it now?
[2:47:52] <%jonblnt> Of course woolie’s going to lab it
[2:47:59] <Jrocy247> Yes, I know it's a long game, Nothing wrong with wanting more content. That's all
[2:48:09] <%andre11dr> People didn't even play the game and they already want DLC LUL
[2:48:11] <%CatRidder> run away and cast
[2:48:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Jump Jump Right
[2:48:33] <+Jiggisnipe> idk he's pretty aggressive
[2:48:39] <it_came_from_outer_space> @andre11dr when the hype cycle is addicting
[2:48:45] <+RedMaskBandit> damn Bloodhound is really getting that Wool-ussy
[2:48:48] <seainspace> it's like 80 hours to beat the mains story, doing all the sidecontent & stuff will apparently easily push you over 200
[2:49:04] <zhenthrim213> RAIN
[2:49:06] <Jrocy247> It's not even hype cycling, it's just genuine curious. What are yall on? LUL
[2:49:08] <it_came_from_outer_space> Believe
[2:49:10] <+hoenhime344> yeaaaaa!!! the backdown!!!!
[2:49:14] <%jonblnt> An hour later
[2:49:14] <whiteblacklight74> @nochejunior doesn't seem like you're supposed to fight it now, woolie just wants to feel himself
[2:49:15] <+kewlmyc> Woolie is about to grind the fuck out of this in his spare time
[2:49:33] <%andre11dr> Damn ,imagine if the game is bas ,like 70% through it because a David Cage game
[2:49:41] <%andre11dr> bad*
[2:50:10] <it_came_from_outer_space> I will simply not imagine that lol
[2:50:21] <whiteblacklight74> don't get touched
[2:50:23] <CapCasual> He's easily killable with the spell alone, zero need for the shield. Just spacing and timing.
[2:50:24] <it_came_from_outer_space> I will attempt to forget about david cage until his star wars game comes out and be at peace
[2:50:25] <+hoenhime344> there he goes

[2:53:46] <%boletoh> *summon lol
[2:53:50] <Rennightwing94> Watching you im reminded how souls games are 99% labing.
[2:53:51] <AvroEltz> Woolie, i'm not saying you can't do it, but i don't think its worth it
[2:53:51] <SupidaMan> half again
[2:53:52] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> woolieFROG
[2:53:52] <spaghettiweaver> no point in using the shield me thinks. probably better to just 2hand it
[2:53:56] <SupidaMan> only getting better
[2:53:56] <ashenjuan25> Lame it out lol
[2:53:57] <chinelord> don't give up skeleton
[2:53:58] <%andre11dr> What if you peed on him? He might get grossed out and run away
[2:53:58] <Jrocy247> That casting is doing some damage, nothing wrong with using it
[2:53:59] <%SirGO0SE> you got this

[2:54:20] <+hoenhime344> i just wish he didnt have this stupid pin prick weapon
[2:54:24] <+Javaa01> Yeah you're not gonna win this one in melee, but you can stick it out with magic
[2:54:24] <+Jiggisnipe> @Jrocy247 yea but it misses and he doesn't time to cast some time
[2:54:25] <+RedMaskBandit> negative Ghost Ride, you got this PokBlaziken
[2:54:36] <ashenjuan25> @andre11dr if he peed on him his character would have to be renamed Samantha Bridges
[2:54:39] <%jonblnt> I think you’re weapon set is a bad match up against this boss
[2:54:44] <T_Sasquatch> after the shit woolie did with that epilleptic nightmare of a game called everhood, im never doubting woolie
[2:54:45] <BlackermanZX> remember the lab is ALWAYS open kolSLURP
[2:54:46] <+Jiggisnipe> time to drop your shield? PogChamp
[2:55:07] <%andre11dr> @ashenjuan25 Ok ,you got me LUL

[2:55:30] <zhenthrim213> cliped
[2:55:31] <MAX116030> @WoolieVersus your jump R2 should stager him. Nut not sure if can with rapier
[2:55:32] <+hoenhime344> forgot*
[2:55:33] <%SirGO0SE> that was just a practice round
[2:55:34] <%andre11dr> Apathy is death
[2:55:39] <Ashenik1> just the tip
[2:55:44] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> PotFriend
[2:55:44] <Jrocy247> @jonblnt I gurantee you someone RIGHT NOW, is probably doing a Bare fist run or whatever with the weakest weapon. Anything is possible
[2:55:45] <+allups> damn cat statue took me five tries
[2:55:51] <BlackermanZX> fucking marth players
[2:56:00] <ashenjuan25> Statement: Apaaaathy is deeaaath
[2:56:07] <+ScrubinBubblez> The attack timing mixups are wild
[2:56:18] <it_came_from_outer_space> @allups pretty good tbh, that guy has very unnatural timings
[2:56:31] <+RedMaskBandit> remember your breathing
[2:56:43] <+hoenhime344> he should try the FP thrush
[2:56:48] <+hoenhime344> thrust
[2:57:01] <+Javaa01> Also sipping FP isn't gonna heal you
[2:57:04] <+hoenhime344> ahhhh gotcha
[2:57:04] <xxHungryxx> we still trying to take on bloodhound
[2:57:29] <%andre11dr> If Woolie really dose this before unlocking the game mechanics, I'll be impressed
[2:57:37] <Ashenik1> rapiers are stylish as fuck
[2:57:41] <+hoenhime344> woolie not those dudes who can switch entire sets of gear mid fight?
[2:57:43] <%jonblnt> Try realloting the estus

[3:03:02] <+RowenCleric> does this guy count as a Guts, I think he counts as a Guts
[3:03:04] <Ashenik1> could woolie theoretically parry this boss?
[3:03:15] <%radiorosewater> @Ashenik1 Yes
[3:03:17] <+0neReeler> #lorebattle

[3:04:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Blussy Hussy Knussy Darnwussy
[3:04:08] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> SLEAVE!!!!
[3:04:10] <+StreamingInVain> You can avoid low sweeps by jumping
[3:04:18] <xxHungryxx> when bloodhound hits, he hits
[3:04:18] <velgaduere> only Kirby sleeves
[3:04:26] <+RedMaskBandit> @velgaduere you fell for our trap, we are all in Pat's chatussy
[3:04:26] <ashenjuan25> The real abyss was in her pockets
[3:04:30] <killjoy0025> yeh yeh yeh you got it
[3:04:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:04:50] <+Grayhammatter> you got this man
[3:05:03] <%jonblnt> I don’t know why I forget how woolie is sometimes
[3:05:16] <%andre11dr> No matter what you think of this, you can't deny the determination
[3:05:19] <shandytowne> Why highlight that
[3:05:25] <Jrocy247> Imagine we had to do this with Bloodborne's Healing mechanic LUL
[3:05:25] <+Grayhammatter> downloaded?
[3:05:27] <it_came_from_outer_space> This boss is so on the hard drive
[3:05:33] <velgaduere> @shandytowne looking for redemption from chat or smth idk
[3:05:39] <+PkSilent01> I forget can you jump in Elden Ring like in Sekiro?
[3:05:45] <killjoy0025> You are as the borg. you are adapting
[3:06:05] <shandytowne> More like hoping the streamer sees them negging them…lol.
[3:06:07] <seainspace> bodied
[3:06:07] <MAX116030> @WoolieVersus can you show how your jump R2 attack looks like?
[3:06:08] <Jrocy247> @PkSilent01 Jump is not as good as it is in Sekiro
[3:06:16] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Look, if y'all don't like boss runs then why are you watching a Fromsoft game stream!?
[3:06:32] <%Reveresao> @WoolieVersus Ja Rule has broken his silence and finally spoken about the current world issues woolieKICKDAD
[3:06:51] <dds333a> Yep, you can jump, but like most other video games, their jumps are world apart LUL
[3:06:53] <seainspace> boss runs are one hing, optional boss runs when you haven't even finshed the tutorial?
[3:06:54] <jubejube56> Wait Ja Rule knows?!
[3:07:07] <dds333a> he KNEW
[3:07:08] <it_came_from_outer_space> I hope this guy drops some cool loot
[3:07:14] <gespenstkick> Ja roll
[3:07:20] <+Grayhammatter> i can't believe ja rule knew
[3:07:27] <Jrocy247> He better drop some cool shit, like his armor...Or Sword
[3:07:28] <%jonblnt> The fashion of this world looks like a marriage of Bloodborne and Demon Souls. I’m loving this
[3:07:32] <%andre11dr> Ja was behind it all
[3:07:36] <AvroEltz> Ja Rule always knows
[3:07:40] <velgaduere> Black Knight sip punish
[3:07:42] <%AngryAsian5> Not even giving you a chance LUL
[3:07:45] <xxHungryxx> no sips allowed lol
[3:07:52] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[3:07:54] <SupidaMan> under geared
[3:07:54] <+hoenhime344> no sunny D allowed
[3:07:55] <%AngryAsian5> He sees you take a sip, and its on LUL
[3:07:55] <dds333a> doko
[3:07:59] <+Grayhammatter> he stole all your kool-aid
[3:07:59] <it_came_from_outer_space> He wants a sip
[3:08:02] <alexandrecau> Feel like that boss comes back without silhouette
[3:08:11] <Jrocy247> Also use your magic
[3:08:13] <velgaduere> "you better share or imma slap it out your hand"
[3:08:14] <ashenjuan25> Damn woolie fell for it
[3:08:18] <SupidaMan> more magic
[3:08:21] <SupidaMan> and use mana flask
[3:08:26] <ashenjuan25> Just lame it out
[3:08:26] <alexandrecau> like the judge in ds3
[3:08:30] <ashenjuan25> Spam the summon sword
[3:08:35] <%andre11dr> This dude's definitely on that purp
[3:08:40] <+Jiggisnipe> just don't get hit woolieFROG
[3:08:59] <MAX116030> @WoolieVersus  hmmm jump R2 stagers even this boss but I saw it with normal sword and not rapier. Still can try jump over horizontal and R2 him. You havent right?
[3:09:09] <ashenjuan25> Side rolling the overheads looks like a safe way to consistently heal
[3:09:12] <dds333a> dust to dust
[3:09:15] <knight_of_the_edge> woolie why dont you get some better armor, you have enough for a piece of the chain set right now
[3:09:15] <%Reveresao> Maybe come back later....
[3:09:22] <AzureHalo> You got this Woolz, slap his butt!
[3:09:35] <SupidaMan> this is the way
[3:09:37] <+hoenhime344> you didnt block? it looked like his shield wasent up
[3:09:42] <%andre11dr> Just ram him with your horse
[3:09:46] <%radiorosewater> is this Wude?
[3:09:53] <seainspace> he hasn't got the horse yet
[3:10:34] <%andre11dr> I know, you can't summon the horse here
[3:10:43] <SupidaMan> ya
[3:11:11] <seainspace> there was a ghost in here ridng a horse tho
[3:11:17] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> He wouldn't be allowed to summon a horse anyway.
[3:11:18] <SupidaMan> doesnt have horse yet anyways
[3:11:21] <+Grayhammatter> this knight's flash-stepping
[3:11:26] <LunarRemix> The ghost is outside of the arena in the normal overworld
[3:11:28] <MAX116030> @WoolieVersus Oooooh thats why Maximilian had easier time, rapier jumping attack has no stager while Max used sword, no wonder he kept saying its OP
[3:11:28] <+allups> rip
[3:11:32] <+Jiggisnipe> @seainspace probably outside
[3:11:33] <%Ashenik1> Ashenik1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I see you have picked Griffith as your Elden Ring character. Hopefully he will evolve into a majestic and beautiful femto. I subconciously have taken Casca... GOD DAMN YOU FROM!!!

[3:20:43] <killjoy0025> Wish they would have had a different sound for the magic casting. That one gets old

[3:34:51] <%jonblnt> Don’t forget about your parry. You love a good parry
[3:34:53] <dds333a> @jubejube56 kind of a serious answer to your rhetorical, but I've always loved it because it implies a process or framework to the magic itself

[3:39:54] <blackskulldragon18> oh good
[3:39:57] <rReizs> sounds like a riposte but you probably need to neutral attack instead of continuing combo
[3:40:05] <dan_g_v> does Woolz have another magic spell, or just this summon sword?

[3:40:49] <%Afterman_> they seem to chase a good distance in the outer world, idk about indoors
[3:41:18] <%radiorosewater> enemy chase is similair to Sekiro, long aggro range
[3:41:24] <Shiibbae> Note: when there are no enemies around running does not take stamina
[3:41:31] <+allups> beast azula 1st try
[3:41:36] <Irishgamerlawd> The lack of camera jank in this compared to DS2 is amazing
[3:41:39] <+allups> was suprised

[3:41:55] <Pookiedaexzile> You locked eyes with him
[3:42:04] <dds333a> lackadaisical tbh Kappa

[4:12:37] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[4:12:41] <%Lion_kun> I am shocked how many secrets are in the game, there's always a cave on the side you don't see lol

[4:19:24] <velgaduere> yeah it seems like a lot of the bosses are fuckin tough
[4:19:26] <+hoenhime344> this weapon is ASS
[4:19:31] <ExpressNode> I saw that the game released early. I rarely see that happen
[4:19:32] <Pookiedaexzile> paige is in this same level

[4:39:41] <+tsamxxx> bonfirechan still goated
[4:39:45] <+0neReeler> seek seek lest
[4:39:48] <unluckymarsbar> new level-up lady technology
[4:39:50] <velgaduere> @serigof eventually it's just "lose virginity"
[4:39:51] <+Jiggisnipe> DeS is the only one who does that?
[4:39:57] <Treasure_Vault> Finally just went back to bonfirechan. It's the best system.
[4:40:00] <%Afterman_> my new bitch better than my old one
[4:40:03] <%jonblnt> Best level up system in souls
[4:40:04] <+Arnoldoaad1> thank you level up-chan SeemsGood
[4:40:04] <+0neReeler> ending should change depending how much you listen to the waifu, like sh2
[4:40:05] <+Grayhammatter> no longer maidenless
[4:40:05] <jubejube56> Level up menu asmr
[4:40:06] <fearjunkie> ....why STR
[4:40:07] <%CatRidder> all to arcane
[4:40:08] <dds333a> Maiden did that, and she does too
[4:40:23] <%townzzzzz> get sum health
[4:40:28] <Pookiedaexzile> MIND Intelligence, Archane and Faith
[4:40:29] <velgaduere> best find yourself a str weapon then my man
[4:40:32] <it_came_from_outer_space> @WoolieVersus would like to remind you that arcane is item discovery and that a few points in it are a genuinely good idea along the way
[4:40:34] <+anoldtoilet> str int again epic
[4:40:36] <Pookiedaexzile> How many fucking wizards are their
[4:40:45] <+anoldtoilet> woolie there is a str weapon literally 5 feet from you iirc
[4:40:48] <+anoldtoilet> in the big cart
[4:40:48] <+0neReeler> all in int
[4:40:48] <+Vigonept> is faith good in this game?
[4:40:50] <+eanscrale> Gee I wonder if there's a big sword that shoots magic in this game
[4:40:54] <unluckymarsbar> @Pookiedaexzile this is the wizardest a FromSoft game has ever been
[4:40:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[4:41:00] <penitentpendant> At least until katana's show up
[4:41:05] <LunarRemix> It's a good idea to level up VIgor early in the game. Starting health is really small
[4:41:06] <whiteblacklight74> wait, is mind the int start or is it arcane?
[4:41:13] <xeros720> i heard someone refer to this as DS1, so that's how i'm thinking of things
[4:41:17] <+Vigonept> arcane luck
[4:41:24] <whiteblacklight74> oh wait, int is right there derp
[4:41:25] <neet98> int is the int stat
[4:41:31] <+anoldtoilet> arcane is for specific equipment and spells as well
[4:41:35] <penitentpendant> @whiteblacklight74 Mind is FP stat
[4:41:36] <%Namillus> Mind extends your FP, Intelligence affects Sorcery damage, Arcane slightly affects Sorcery and Invocation damage but is also DROP RATE
[4:41:38] <Pookiedaexzile> So why the Dexy Build
[4:41:42] <+anoldtoilet> bleed builds and bleed build genre stuff is arcane
[4:41:44] <LunarRemix> Mind is more focus bar. Arcane is item discovery + some specific requirements for magic and equips
[4:41:48] <themetalraider> Giant,Giant,Giant.
[4:41:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> is FP for focus points?
[4:42:07] <Treasure_Vault> I don't want to talk out of my ass here, but this game seems good
[4:42:07] <LunarRemix> Yeah
[4:42:07] <Partial_Recall_> arcane is 'luck'
[4:42:08] <+anoldtoilet> arcane is luck but also a special build casting stat
[4:42:08] <%CatRidder> arcene is luck
[4:42:11] <+charp35> Arcane is just luck
[4:42:12] <neet98> LUK build
[4:42:12] <+anoldtoilet> its not QUITE luck
[4:42:13] <warhand93> @suckerpunchsyd  magic
[4:42:24] <+anoldtoilet> certain spells and equipment do need arcane
[4:42:27] <+Vigonept> NICE NO VITALITY
[4:42:29] <LunarRemix> Some spells scale with Arcane
[4:42:29] <%Ashenik1> game just came out and you guys already know how the lvl up system works....
[4:42:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ahh gotcha gotcha thanks @warhand93
[4:42:44] <%Namillus> Oh did they move Equip Load back to End from Str?
[4:42:56] <velgaduere> you and Paige were both literally looking at the exact same tooltip just now
[4:42:57] <velgaduere> wild
[4:43:19] <BedHome> arcane doesnt mean magic, it means "knowledge that is shut away and hard to find". its mainly luck in elden ring
[4:43:20] <unluckymarsbar> smug wizard is protected from faith builds
[4:43:32] <themetalraider> What rings you got bitch?
[4:43:39] <LunarRemix> You can respec later in the game so don't worry too much
[4:43:40] <neet98> 2
[4:43:42] <BedHome> arcane only *means* magic because of fantasy tropes, like how MANA is also a completly different thing
[4:43:44] <it_came_from_outer_space> @WoolieVersus I have heard a single piece of anecdotl evidence that 10 arcane is at a point where you get a nice amount of items. could also jusst worry about it later tho
[4:43:48] <+Kobrafan79> arcane effect status effect builds like bleed poison and frostbite
[4:43:54] <it_came_from_outer_space> *anecdotal
[4:43:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1495994438551851008?t=MtwwBoXiBdU6LlIYk0i-Kw&s=19
[4:43:55] <+Grayhammatter> whoa, she just peace'd out
[4:43:57] <fmbboaventura> If we have int, what does arcane do?
[4:43:57] <+eanscrale> Oh vitality does exist, but does something different
[4:43:58] <velgaduere> @BedHome the more common word for that definition is now "esoteric"
[4:44:03] <%CatRidder> pat said that you can respect later
[4:44:08] <+hoenhime344> Goatback riding
[4:44:10] <unluckymarsbar> Summon: Horse
[4:44:13] <xeros720> heal your horse
[4:44:18] <neet98> combat on horse
[4:44:21] <fearjunkie> this game is unplayable w mouse and keyboard....
[4:44:30] <alexandrecau> cry a horse
[4:44:36] <dds333a> @catridder "respect" indeed, the player has to be careful
[4:44:45] <%jonblnt> Equip summons on the d-pad
[4:44:52] <w_khan> @fearjunkie why? sekiro and DS3 played well
[4:44:55] <BedHome> @velgaduere yeah thats a good example, though esoteric more closely means knowledge that can only be gained by close reading of a work or intitation into a society or culture
[4:45:02] <jubejube56> lol I just remembered how breath of the wild had that shrine where a god revived your horse for you
[4:45:10] <BedHome> : D this is the most my linguistics degree is ever useful
[4:45:35] <velgaduere> @BedHome happy to see another person with a love for language
[4:45:47] <unluckymarsbar> manifesting a horse in my mind
[4:46:00] <+Vigonept> use multiple is use selected
[4:46:03] <velgaduere> maybe you can select multiple at a time?
[4:46:04] <%Afterman_> use selected= use as many as you want at once
[4:46:05] <%notsoy> use selected quantity? perhaps?
[4:46:10] <LunarRemix> Use Selected for quantity
[4:46:14] <%notsoy> i extremely doubt they would only do one or all
[4:46:21] <+hoenhime344> you pick a number
[4:46:29] <w_khan> use slected is multiple
[4:46:39] <%notsoy> not with everything else they've done to make it less obtuse and awkward

[4:48:41] <+dearghostss> the future is now reggie
[4:48:42] <LorcaNomad> Torrent is Brazilian?
[4:48:45] <unluckymarsbar> hold on a moment, I'm shifting into Knight Mode
[4:48:49] <w_khan> Lets go Roach
[4:48:51] <%AngryAsian5> Skyrim Souls
[4:48:55] <+0neReeler> shortcuts on the right side of the ui
[4:48:55] <gespenstkick> hE CAN DOUBLE JUMP!
[4:48:55] <glass_marcus> We got a Brazilian Horse
[4:49:01] <%livlinn> Zelden ring shiaHypers
[4:49:12] <MarsonMad> b to sprint
[4:49:13] <%notsoy> long weapons are probably a way better fit for horseback fighting
[4:49:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> TWO JUMPS Kreygasm
[4:49:17] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[4:49:21] <w_khan> Brazilian horse would be a Capibara
[4:49:33] <+Grayhammatter> i am speed
[4:49:35] <Grantu235> L1 for left side
[4:49:38] <+pkmamsters> wow just like pokemon arceus Kappa
[4:49:39] <+Kobrafan79> watching pat try to hit peopel with a dagger on horseback was painful
[4:49:39] <it_came_from_outer_space> yea greatswords and halberds seem good for on horse
[4:49:50] <%Ashenik1> this whistle is straight from Sekiro
[4:50:00] <LunarRemix> You've got to admit that dagger did some good work tho
[4:50:05] <+anoldtoilet> Woolie dont forget those two giant carts on the perimeter are chests w items
[4:50:14] <+Grayhammatter> oh wow, that dude's real
[4:50:16] <LorcaNomad> boing
[4:50:24] <+0neReeler> don't remember if people can just knock you off
[4:50:26] <+Kobrafan79> @lunarremix absolutely I just think it's terrible on horseback
[4:50:27] <unluckymarsbar> the best thing about this horse is that its name lead to FromSoft putting out a poster that just said 'TORRENT Elden Ring'
[4:50:27] <%Ashenik1> mongolian style
[4:50:29] <haisho> oops all da bois
[4:50:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're drawin em out all right
[4:50:35] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:50:51] <gryffinp> @0neReeler one of the stats SAYS that it helps prevent you from getting knocked off the horse, so I assume so
[4:51:09] <%Ashenik1> kindda gives Mount and blade vibes
[4:51:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:51:10] <+0neReeler> ghost of tsushima this camp
[4:51:18] <%jonblnt> Good baiting

[4:51:27] <morningmoondude> Spin2Win
[4:51:34] <gryffinp> get horse circle strafed
[4:51:38] <it_came_from_outer_space> the horse fighting can get a LITTLE silly as far as ive seen
[4:51:38] <+0neReeler> yea thought in preview someone like did a takedown and pulled you off the horse
[4:51:39] <masterfire23> you can do this without the horse
[4:51:47] <BlackermanZX> get megaman legend'd
[4:51:51] <w_khan> yeah its not a free win, its more a starter poke
[4:51:53] <LunarRemix> Enemies can parry you off your horse
[4:51:53] <%AngryAsian5> Running around a mob of enemies trying to catch stragglers. Some Mount and Blade tactics right there LUL
[4:52:03] <Treasure_Vault> turns out spears vs horses is like historically in favour of the spears
[4:52:11] <%adamisbarely3d> damn, once you get the hang of the horse combat these guys are never going to be able to hit you again
[4:52:21] <+0neReeler> horseback? spearmen we here
[4:52:38] <+OctaivianRex> OOo that spell is neat.
[4:52:40] <%jonblnt> Back stabs and parries
[4:52:54] <w_khan> Like the Witcher games horse isnt a advantage unless agains other horses
[4:52:54] <+Grayhammatter> cool things in the carts maybe?
[4:52:56] <haisho> looks like Estoc is kinda meh on the horse to be frank
[4:53:15] <velgaduere> yeyeye

[4:53:36] <%adamisbarely3d> this needs a test drive
[4:53:40] <roadwarior2> You should go give that horseman over by the first bonfire a try. He’s got a good drop.
[4:53:42] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> You wrecked face with the flail in DS1.

[4:57:22] <+MooseIsGoose> Is this mimic kun
[4:57:23] <stormhawk9891> hehehehehe
[4:57:24] <%AngryAsian5> Kappa Kappa
[4:57:29] <velgaduere> YOU DEFEATED
[4:57:36] <dan_g_v> look the chain
[4:57:40] <MarsonMad> @jonblnt i don't think so it worked for me just fine
[4:57:42] <+Grayhammatter> YOU DEFEATED
[4:57:54] <+hoenhime344> yo...this is missable??
[4:58:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> @hoenhime344 no this is a tooltip you get when you find your first ashes of war
[4:58:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:58:21] <it_came_from_outer_space> but this specific ashes yes
[4:58:22] <it_came_from_outer_space> it is
[4:58:30] <+hoenhime344> ah, gotcha
[4:58:34] <unluckymarsbar> remember how the estus flask was missable in DS1
[4:58:46] <Treasure_Vault> Gotta love flail
[4:58:48] <+Grayhammatter> spin to win
[4:58:59] <+Combatrobot423> @unluckymarsbar I don't think that's true?
[4:59:13] <+Kobrafan79> it's so cool they put flails in this game
[4:59:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @unluckymarsbar  I did it by accident my first time and was so confused when i saw someone had one years later
[4:59:29] <+Grayhammatter> yep, that's a flail
[4:59:30] <glass_marcus> @unluckymarsbar that's a glitch
[4:59:36] <%notsoy> charge attack is neat
[4:59:42] <%DkLordG> chrystahll somehow missed the flask
[4:59:49] <%notsoy> hold it down
[5:00:06] <+Jiggisnipe> we spin it
[5:00:08] <Partial_Recall_> that shield straight up has a butthole on it
[5:00:11] <unluckymarsbar> yeah it's a glitch but that still makes it missable
[5:00:15] <+anoldtoilet> this combos into a followup
[5:00:15] <%DkLordG> *Chrystaahhl
[5:00:17] <+anoldtoilet> yea
[5:00:17] <penitentpendant> Spin to win~
[5:00:18] <zhenthrim213> SPIN TO WIN
[5:00:18] <+anoldtoilet> its cool
[5:00:25] <@Solidus_113> FP skills you can always use but it won't do much damage
[5:00:31] <karismaticprik> I'm gonna swing my chain in air and if you fill that air...
[5:00:34] <%AngryAsian5> Looks cool
[5:00:34] <KamenWriter85> Castlevania 4 spin to win real
[5:00:41] <pepinillomaton> Griffith!
[5:00:47] <it_came_from_outer_space> lack of fp i think
[5:00:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Looks like the Gigwhirl animation
[5:00:57] <+Jaromero435> fp
[5:00:59] <atomizedstream> no fp
[5:00:59] <+anoldtoilet> out of fp
[5:01:00] <+hoenhime344> they are weaker versions
[5:01:02] <+Grayhammatter> lack of fp?
[5:01:04] <+dreadd_wolfsbane> FP too low
[5:01:06] <foghornleghorn55> no fp
[5:01:13] <+hoenhime344> when you have fp there is a whit glow
[5:01:20] <dds333a> @pookiedaexzile Whirligig, yeah
[5:01:22] <+Jaromero435> some shields let you use a weapon skill
[5:01:37] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus if you have a shield with no skill you can do it one handed
[5:01:38] <+anoldtoilet> is this the same cart? i forget
[5:01:40] <+anoldtoilet> theres 2 here
[5:01:48] <MarsonMad> no
[5:01:48] <+SjoeB89> So this is Dark Souls 4?
[5:01:50] <+Grayhammatter> different one
[5:01:56] <MarsonMad> its another one
[5:02:00] <velgaduere> @SjoeB89 no, it's King's Field 11
[5:02:01] <Pookiedaexzile> @dds333a Thanks
[5:02:04] <dds333a> @sjoeb89 Kappa
[5:02:22] <+anoldtoilet> it penetrated his shield tho
[5:02:22] <dds333a> @pookiedaexzile sure thibg
[5:02:23] <%notsoy> fat rolls? o no
[5:02:24] <+anoldtoilet> he couldnt block it

[5:03:04] <velgaduere> YO
[5:03:07] <velgaduere> GS?
[5:03:09] <KamenWriter85> Ooooh
[5:03:09] <+Jaromero435> yeyeyeye
[5:03:10] <+Grayhammatter> big old greatsword
[5:03:18] <it_came_from_outer_space> pronounce it 3 times fast
[5:03:19] <%adamisbarely3d> the longer you charge the spell, the longer it will wait
[5:03:24] <Aussie_Manny> Try say that five times. Lordsworn's Greatsword.
[5:03:29] <+GallowsDrop> STR Weapon!
[5:03:50] <+hoenhime344> finaly getting rid of that estoc
[5:03:52] <%o_almighty_1> What Lore y’all uncovered up in here?
[5:03:54] <roadwarior2> It’s what I’m rocking currently.
[5:04:06] <%jonblnt> That’s a good straight sword
[5:04:19] <%Ashenik1> Claymore?
[5:04:28] <+RowenCleric> the classic over the shoulder claymore stance
[5:04:35] <roadwarior2> Basically this game’s claymore
[5:04:38] <+Grayhammatter> classic
[5:05:02] <dds333a> @o_almighty_1 shit went bad after the Elden Ring shattered, the goddess (?) dipped, and her kids all got pieces and did their shit with it. whether good or ill
[5:05:10] <+eanscrale> it's the bastard sword alright
[5:05:16] <%notsoy> weapon art is pretty neat
[5:05:29] <dds333a> Then a big fucking war popped off, we got a bunch of names with no context, and that's it
[5:05:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:05:30] <%Ashenik1> parry?
[5:05:34] <it_came_from_outer_space> hold it?
[5:05:36] <it_came_from_outer_space> idk?
[5:05:40] <Treasure_Vault> stamp into heavy
[5:05:42] <+Grayhammatter> RT after
[5:05:47] <+allups> counter
[5:05:47] <+Combatrobot423> press R2 after yeah
[5:05:49] <+allups> ?
[5:05:50] <+Kobrafan79> r2 after the stomp
[5:05:51] <CapCasual> Stamp + R2
[5:05:54] <penitentpendant> The classic upward strike
[5:05:58] <+sevorai> Super armor R2
[5:05:58] <roadwarior2> Follow up a strong attack with a light
[5:06:03] <MarsonMad> poise
[5:06:05] <velgaduere> only one way to find out
[5:06:08] <penitentpendant> Shield Breaker
[5:06:10] <LunarRemix> Yes.
[5:06:13] <+Bajimxenn> loving that chain mail sound
[5:06:14] <+ElectricHoodie> that looks like it hits behind too lol
[5:06:14] <+eanscrale> this used to be for ultra swords
[5:06:15] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[5:06:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> I guess its like a tank into strong counter
[5:06:18] <+Kobrafan79> it's super armor yes
[5:06:23] <LunarRemix> It's super armor
[5:06:23] <it_came_from_outer_space> like a better trade
[5:06:23] <velgaduere> probably meant for heavier armor builds
[5:06:25] <Aussie_Manny> Prevents recoil? That's an odd way to say "powers through enemy attack".
[5:06:30] <+Combatrobot423> @eanscrale The bastard sword in DS3 had it too
[5:06:47] <atomizedstream> this was the case in ds3
[5:06:49] <Rennightwing94> Damage , but no stagger
[5:06:59] <+hoenhime344> same as ds3
[5:07:01] <+MooseIsGoose> Yes
[5:07:04] <SnakeariesTheThird> there is likely left hand items that'll let you use right hand skills
[5:07:10] <%Noxgalehart> Noxgalehart subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:07:11] <+misdirectedwoo> yep
[5:07:11] <+eanscrale> @Combatrobot423 ah didn't use much of the greatswords in that
[5:07:13] <LunarRemix> Yes. Some Shields have no skills.
[5:07:21] <atomizedstream> @woolieversus the staff doesnt have a skill
[5:07:22] <+Kobrafan79> yes you need to remove the parry from your shield
[5:07:35] <Aussie_Manny> pfffft
[5:07:41] <+misdirectedwoo> there's a skill that says this has no skill
[5:07:42] <Aussie_Manny> modCheck
[5:07:51] <+Jiggisnipe> tbf Woolie
[5:08:02] <+Jiggisnipe> aren't you switching to PS5 after this
[5:08:17] <%Ashenik1> why?
[5:08:29] <Aussie_Manny> oh, is this PC right now?
[5:08:39] <Jewoodsforreal> Is cross save an option for this game?
[5:08:43] <MarsonMad> degrees
[5:08:44] <it_came_from_outer_space> yea pc unlocked 6 hours earlier
[5:08:45] <+Jaromero435> no
[5:08:49] <%Lion_kun> Woolie will switch to console for next session
[5:08:55] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[5:08:58] <%Lion_kun> the PC version is really rough right now
[5:09:02] <+Grayhammatter> too chonky
[5:09:02] <+Jiggisnipe> um I think for performance reasons. I don't remember
[5:09:11] <Aussie_Manny> Oohhhh. So Pat was playing on an early copy on PS5, but he was an exception.
[5:09:15] <Aussie_Manny> That confused me.
[5:09:17] <MarsonMad> for a full ring you're gonna need 360
[5:09:26] <%Ashenik1> LUL
[5:09:29] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Pat was sponsored I think
[5:09:30] <it_came_from_outer_space> performance and fear of multiplayer exploits on pc
[5:09:33] <%Lion_kun> Pat sucked a lot of duck to get his copy early lol
[5:09:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> so ps5 is the safer option
[5:09:44] <+0neReeler> focus attack
[5:09:49] <%Lion_kun> I said duck....that was a typo

[5:14:07] <+SjoeB89> Any stutters?
[5:14:09] <velgaduere> WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
[5:14:11] <%adamisbarely3d> It wants to be played!
[5:14:24] <it_came_from_outer_space> that was a long 38 mins
[5:14:34] <+Grayhammatter> the longest 38 minutes
[5:14:35] <dds333a> LUL
[5:14:54] <+eanscrale> Time is relative
[5:15:07] <@Solidus_113> Fresh and new souls joint
[5:15:07] <Treasure_Vault> We love romping
[5:15:07] <+Jiggisnipe> but open world tho
[5:15:13] <+Grayhammatter> we love a good romp
[5:15:18] <Treasure_Vault> No one else has the same flavour of romp
[5:15:19] <Aussie_Manny> It's the new Fromsoft game, but it's REALLY BIG!
[5:15:21] <%SirGO0SE> this one has felt like a very long wait
[5:15:22] <dds333a> After a long time without one
[5:15:25] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> True
[5:15:31] <dds333a> Souls, anyway
[5:15:33] <@Solidus_113> I already like it more than DS3
[5:15:36] <+vaderxyz1970> I want MOAR
[5:15:37] <trilmonte> I want that but without the arduous task of playing it.
[5:15:40] <w_khan> First chance to play and not get spoiled/backseated
[5:15:46] <trilmonte> Hence why I'm here. :)
[5:15:48] <+BananaSlammuh> Being a new Fromsoft romp is reason enough. Actually.
[5:15:49] <ToxInjection> A new FromSoft is provocative. Gets the people going VoHiYo
[5:15:54] <it_came_from_outer_space> Also with the online feature playing it near launch is SO much fun imo
[5:16:09] <it_came_from_outer_space> just genuinely a special gaming experience
[5:16:10] <dds333a> @toxinjection it doesn't need to make sense
[5:16:14] <+eanscrale> fun fact all the pvp tech in ds1 were from unintended glitches.
[5:16:16] <+0neReeler> elden ring...

[5:18:21] <+BananaSlammuh> @imadoc91 Agreed. Also just the general Norse inspiration but that’s a good particular example
[5:18:25] <+0neReeler> summon sword
[5:18:26] <+Jiggisnipe> yea that spell is cool
