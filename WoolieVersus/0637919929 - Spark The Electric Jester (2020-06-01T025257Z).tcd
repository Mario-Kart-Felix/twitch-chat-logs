[0:01:43] <+rosabellamelantha> no freedom planet is great
[0:01:47] <SheefEatsBeef> yup

[0:02:01] <$dozind16> play some Gundam extreme vs
[0:02:09] <InXplotch> it looks like tape, lol, like masking tape or something
[0:02:10] <%JustYudha> Freedom Plant gives me some creepy furry vibes
[0:02:15] <%gatorafan> Freedom Planet is super cool, I just get irrationally butthurt at people calling it Sonic because it doesn't play like classic Sonic.

[0:02:50] <derap41> Thee Space Marines is the most boring thing about 40K
[0:02:54] <1matheuw> i mean the only semblance of sonic in this game is the fact that the protagonist is kinda fast
[0:02:55] <%Superbro64> @gatorafan I suppose it plays like sonic advance I guess? The wide screen view freedom planet gets is not really not like sonic
[0:03:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> Gotta use my ps4 to stream cause laptop battery quit living and is no longer recognized by by my laptop
[0:03:12] <InXplotch> When is woolie gonna play a REAL sonic game, like sonic 06
[0:03:12] <%tearfuldevil> i think the sisters of battle are lame, because they're edgy nuns with boobplate
[0:03:15] <%Superbro64> its also a whole lot more gunstars heros spiritual sequel then a sonic game

[0:15:41] <@akuda_bar> woolieMIRIN_TK
[0:15:53] <%mitchteck> Uno works pretty well on tts
[0:15:55] <arkv01> I can barely get my friends in the same city for a weekly discord voice chat

[0:16:48] <derap41> Its hard to break that first constant 2 weeks
[0:17:00] <%sewermonk> holla for sketchy at home gyms lol
[0:17:14] <derap41> Walking is still allowed

[0:17:24] <%FusRoDom> Just spar with punchmom
[0:17:26] <treacherously_> I had the best curry katsu of my life in hakone
[0:17:26] <YakumoYomi> I've been doing Ring Fit Adventure for workouts. It certainly won't replace a gym, but it will keep your stamina/endurance up.
[0:17:26] <@Menitta> woolieGASM_BT this is a good one
[0:17:27] <%paladinstarbuster> for the record having mental health issues doesnt preclude you from working in the field in fact many professionals got int it because of that. it even comes up in class
[0:17:30] <worldbrand> thats probably most people, i mean at 7000 calories per kg it's pretty tough
[0:17:32] <derap41> Diet is 90% of weight loss
[0:17:34] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta SIPP
[0:17:38] <TheGershon> literally started going back to the gym the day before quarantine
[0:17:42] <TheGershon> rip
[0:17:47] <%ChoculaUltra> luckily my neighborhood's a ghost town as of the pandemic. Going out for runs have evoked I Am Legend type feels tbh LUL
[0:17:54] <CyrusVGZ> @paladinstarbuster Agreed
[0:18:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I actually just bought a bike to keep in shape
[0:18:19] <@akuda_bar> hitting your own recording button like some kind of plebian

[0:18:22] <%arcielardor> @woolieversus read Record of Ragnarok. it's a Kumate of 13 gods vs 13 humans. it's got the Bible's Adam in a fist fight with Zeus!!
[0:18:32] <SpodFish> WOOLIE TIME
[0:18:38] <the7thdraconian> I'm nervous cause people seem really eager to start throwing parties at the lake again and I'm worried we're gonna see an uptick in cases cause of that.

[0:19:13] <%ChoculaUltra> @the7thdraconian while I'm all for the return of "regular" life, having lake parties seems like a red flag rn

[0:20:02] <YakumoYomi> @the7thdraconian That's unfortunately already happened here in North Carolina. "2nd Phase" of reopenings happened last Friday...and our state saw the most new COVID cases in a single day happen the very next day.
[0:20:05] <%pectusumbra> okay, what are we looking at here?
[0:20:08] <%SomersaultJustice> this not snes controller
[0:20:08] <KeroKamina> @leaischill Iâ€™m excited, I love all the Xenoblade games
[0:20:09] <CyrusVGZ> I don't really know if I want XBC. I really liked XBC2 but XBC is nothing like that from what I've seen.

[0:20:40] <InXplotch> How old is this game? because I feel like I heard about it a loooong time ago
[0:20:42] <+Chazmosis> It's the same team that worked on Sonic Before and After the Sequel
[0:20:43] <DragonArt07> is this based off of Nights, he looks like a jester

[0:21:22] <%NyxFang> woolieACCIDENT
[0:21:24] <kambamdamn> Is this game finished?
[0:21:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> TwitchUnity
[0:21:29] <YakumoYomi> @CyrusVGZ The underlying gameplay is largely the same. I'd say that XC is better than XC2 because it doesn't go as hard with the shonen anime tropes and you don't have to deal with gacha bullshit of Blade cores/field skills.
[0:21:33] <KeroKamina> IMMERSION SHATTERED

[0:25:37] <TheRickyWill> A tiny heads up as someone whoâ€™s played the game since launch- For some bizzare reason there was a patch that rewrote the entire story into something slightly more weird and slightly more dense, with no real way to revert it. For example, this intro was originally MUCH shorter
[0:25:37] <%gatorafan> You think the author is trying to tell us something?
[0:25:43] <CyrusVGZ> Woolie and the boys should play a Gaunlet game whenever possible. Specifically Gauntlet Dark Legacy for Gamecube/Xbox.
[0:25:45] <woodstock_hobbs> chuck noris is trying to teach me kungfu because of a sandwich

[0:26:02] <Vyneci> BTW, the story was rewritten a while back and it removed some fun lines like Spark being pissed about being awake for a whole day straight
[0:26:03] <%ChoculaUltra> so he became a cam girl?!
[0:26:06] <%Solidnick18> LUL

[0:44:09] <the7thdraconian> Though that does make things simpler.
[0:44:16] <InXplotch> yeah, anyone can be a vtube
[0:44:26] <woodstock_hobbs> my job is to build robots. and the first robot i built just built other robots, so now i serve squishi's at 7-11
[0:44:29] <Monkey_D_Judd> Woolie should become a Vtuber, he could call himself the first N-tuber.
[0:44:33] <the7thdraconian> LIking this music.
[0:44:38] <raveous> kirby hat!
[0:44:50] <WG101> das a beeg swing
[0:44:52] <%arcielardor> robots rust when too much salt is present. So your job is safe, Woolie.
[0:45:10] <woodstock_hobbs> i was gonna make spark the glass robot
[0:45:17] <%BackwardCap> Did you miss the beam sword on the bottom left?
[0:45:18] <+scorpiozilla> I never knew about the rocks
[0:45:40] <@Menitta> Hammer Kirby does the most damage
[0:45:42] <InXplotch> I think you're already wearing them
[0:45:47] <@Solidus_113> Hammer is my shit. That flaming charge kills everything
[0:45:53] <%Superbro64> hammer kirby is op in every game its in
[0:45:55] <@Menitta> It is the death move
[0:45:58] <KeroKamina> The boots are what youâ€™re wearing already
[0:46:00] <woodstock_hobbs> the big ham!
[0:46:04] <%alephalpha> isn't there 3d game of this character?
[0:46:05] <KeroKamina> Itâ€™s how you run fast
[0:46:13] <@Menitta> Suplex is still my fav tho
[0:46:14] <cinosgaming> bruh after speedrunning this stage it's kinda odd seeing people go through it for the first time
[0:46:22] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Suplex is the best plex
[0:46:25] <KeroKamina> @alephalpha sort of, the 3D game is about his rival
[0:46:28] <the7thdraconian> Back to Kamehameha's fuckiers
[0:46:29] <raveous> that sprite kinda reminds me of rayman
[0:46:30] <%alephalpha> how quick is a speedrun of this anyway
[0:46:34] <cinosgaming> uh
[0:46:39] <cinosgaming> around 1:37 so far
[0:46:44] <1matheuw> arrow is busted tho
[0:46:46] <%alephalpha> @KeroKamina is it any good?
[0:46:50] <cinosgaming> that's the record I got, but it was messy anyway
[0:46:51] <woodstock_hobbs> i just saw sonic run by
[0:47:04] <cinosgaming> yeah kickstarter
[0:47:12] <%Superbro64> yes
[0:47:17] <KeroKamina> Yes, both games were

[0:50:37] <%alephalpha> the strats
[0:50:41] <the7thdraconian> Like how each boss is an evolution of the last, while also making sure each one has an interesting design.
[0:51:16] <Vyneci> Jebaited
[0:51:24] <the7thdraconian> Thank god, it died before it could fire.
[0:51:32] <+BubbaRands> That's a good scare Jebaited
[0:51:47] <@Solidus_113> can you charge the sword move speed and then switch to hammer?
[0:51:48] <%alephalpha> so what's thos about an air circulation issue
[0:51:53] <%DaBigVitus> man, why play a sonic game when you could play Kirby instead?

[0:56:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> does this dude have 8 way dashes like hes Magneto or something? woolieREMEMBERS

[1:02:21] <woodstock_hobbs> this has got some cool sonic speed
[1:02:29] <%BackwardCap> *Has shield, dies to frontal attack anyway*
[1:03:03] <woodstock_hobbs> a super attack that gives you a damage hit, taking away the ability
[1:03:17] <ChrisM341> Is this Kirby the MegaHog?
[1:03:29] <plushysceptile> No chance to play the Freedom Planet 2 demo?
[1:03:31] <KeroKamina> The second to last level is probably the best song in the game
[1:03:40] <+Yomigami> Blaze is at it again
[1:03:41] <Wight_Trash> Not a fan of the character design, but everything else is very cool
[1:03:47] <woodstock_hobbs> 3 playtesters

[1:13:20] <$JobbedBone> acktuwally,
[1:13:26] <KeroKamina> Full LP?
[1:13:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> depends on how long the game is
[1:13:55] <megamonmon123> so this game is kirby + sonic
[1:14:00] <megamonmon123> best of both worlds?
[1:14:05] <@Solidus_113> and megaman X
[1:14:10] <unclekulikov> I like the music.
[1:14:19] <megamonmon123> ah okay
[1:14:28] <%Superbro64> gunstar heroes
[1:14:34] <mushplush77> I believe there's 16 stages, each having an A and B part, that aare around 10 minutes each
[1:14:35] <ChrisM341> 90s the game
[1:14:44] <mistermastergreg> R I S T A R
[1:14:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> game is pretty generous with the health pick ups huh
[1:15:04] <+FadingFrost> no rings
[1:15:28] <woodstock_hobbs> the invisible ghost
[1:15:42] <the7thdraconian> Defiinitely fixes a huge problem with the Sonic games in general.
[1:15:59] <%glass_marcus> Good. Touch damage sucks
[1:16:05] <biomegabear> @legacy0117 theres 2
[1:16:07] <woodstock_hobbs> depression the dating sim
[1:16:11] <%BackwardCap> I find damage on contact platform games to be a very outdated design.
[1:16:23] <megamonmon123> oh you have a pogo jump as well
[1:16:37] <woodstock_hobbs> select things that you want to say to the terapist for mental health points and then go through a day at school
[1:16:41] <the7thdraconian> It works in Shovel Knight, but definitely not in a game like Sonic. @BackwardCap
[1:17:03] <the7thdraconian> Oh no!
[1:17:11] <mushplush77> Ooh, clutch
[1:17:12] <megamonmon123> clutch
[1:17:14] <+KineKithZen> Very nice
[1:17:17] <the7thdraconian> HUZZAH!
[1:17:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> clutched
[1:17:24] <+l3sovikk> This more like Megaman or Sonic?
[1:17:24] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:17:30] <megamonmon123> woolie of all people should believe in the power of the blade
[1:17:35] <Vyneci> You can turn off "dashing by double tapping" in the options BTW
[1:17:51] <%trustycoyote> @legacy0117 So said that there are multiple characters in this game or just the one?
[1:18:11] <+bluebreadtoons> Hi woolie will you try the 3D sequel to this game? Itâ€™s meant to be like Sonic Adventure
[1:18:11] <+Joestar_SSB> Freedom Planet vibes
[1:18:13] <Vyneci> There are two characters
[1:18:24] <mushplush77> Yeah there's a mode where you play the faker
[1:18:35] <mushplush77> I'm not saying his name until it's revealed in game
[1:18:48] <1matheuw> wise choice
[1:18:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:19:02] <%trustycoyote> Interesting @mussyplussy @Vyneci
[1:19:07] <BlueFusionVolt> lytMOTIVATED
[1:19:09] <KeroKamina> You have the parry dodge by default, it doesnâ€™t matter what power up you have
[1:19:09] <%chiluzza> the after image really
[1:19:11] <+yoush03> !MOTIVATED
[1:19:11] <@Moobot> 1192 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:19:14] <%alephalpha> theirs a lot of distorion efefcts
[1:19:15] <woodstock_hobbs> the snes might not be able to hold all the abilities with the speed
[1:19:21] <terribleusername> all those effects, yeah
[1:19:22] <biomegabear> sprite quality?
[1:19:27] <megamonmon123> the sound?
[1:19:28] <andrei11dr> The music definitely
[1:19:32] <%trustycoyote> Possibly the water visual effect
[1:19:35] <KeroKamina> The animations in the background for one
[1:19:37] <bravedjohnny> hey woolz, did you play khimera destroy all monster girls? its free to play on steam, its a really good platformer
[1:19:41] <+PulsinFufu> inochiThink the combination of sprites animations and frames
[1:19:43] <%alephalpha> water efefcts are definitely way out of scope
[1:19:44] <%powerprotoman> id rather they go with games as we rememebr them instead of as they were
[1:19:46] <KeroKamina> And the type of tracks in the soundtrack
[1:19:51] <mushplush77> or Plok
[1:19:54] <DedlokPM> I am guessing Reggie couldn't come in so woolie is playing a game woolieFUN ?
[1:20:06] <wunderkindest> Even SNES Killer Instinct
[1:20:09] <Novillion> want this planned to be released on a real snes cartridge?
[1:20:10] <megamonmon123> are water levels more or less hated than sewer levels?
[1:20:14] <+KineKithZen> Rare had so many great composers
[1:20:16] <andrei11dr> Genesis didn't sound like this
[1:20:17] <woodstock_hobbs> i love the 3d animation on snes. donkey kong and mario rpg
[1:20:26] <the7thdraconian> Always interesting to see what people do when updating classic formulas, but with modern twists.
[1:20:32] <+TheOneCalledRock> fuck tim follin
[1:20:35] <+KineKithZen> Yeah it would need a lot more bass synths to be Genesis
[1:20:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> nuff said
[1:20:36] <AnneSQF> those fans in the bg are a bit distracting, dont you think?
[1:20:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> fucking*
[1:20:49] <TheGershon> the super Nintendo can pretty much do any sound you want, it's just a matter of fitting it all onto a cart
[1:20:53] <Nope80808> Altered beast had some real great music
[1:20:57] <the7thdraconian> Shovel Knight is full of so many little touches that make it play like how you remember NES games played.
[1:21:08] <megamonmon123> i think I hate water levels more than sewer ones
[1:21:13] <KeroKamina> The little yellow bar revives you on the spot when itâ€™s full btw
[1:21:16] <+KineKithZen> In a weird way I think the SNES sound chip was a little sterile compared to Genesis, even though Sega's was obviously a lot more limited
[1:21:16] <%Superbro64> ah yes, the classic "third sonic level" problem Kappa
[1:21:28] <mushplush77> Sweet sword battle
[1:21:30] <andrei11dr> Later SNES started to get on this level, but even than, the actual sound quality wasn't this good
[1:21:43] <%paladinstarbuster> The bosses in this game are kinda ass looking
[1:21:45] <biomegabear> learned and lived
[1:22:00] <+Loinclothiclese> @paladinstarbuster kinda? cmonBruh
[1:22:15] <@Solidus_113> no HP
[1:22:17] <KeroKamina> You dropped your power up
[1:22:24] <AnneSQF> you lived laughed loved
[1:22:24] <megamonmon123> @biomegabear living to the edge of tommorow
[1:22:34] <%paladinstarbuster> @Loinclothiclese trying to be nice
[1:22:37] <mistermastergreg> woolie did it
[1:22:37] <KeroKamina> You can drop your power up if you take too much damage like kirby
[1:22:40] <%Superbro64> committed hara kiri Kapps
[1:22:45] <%Superbro64> BibleThump
[1:22:55] <+Loinclothiclese> why? @paladinstarbuster they look like ass
[1:23:06] <+KineKithZen> Some pretty long levels in this game
[1:23:06] <bravedjohnny> you didnt kill him, he killed himself Kappa
[1:23:26] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[1:23:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> >get dashy<
[1:23:29] <KeroKamina> Wind!!! Just kidding!
[1:23:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> you that drom set tho
[1:23:37] <megamonmon123> yeah we air bending
[1:23:46] <%chiluzza> this is just sonic level
[1:23:49] <the7thdraconian> Crap, connection gave out on me. Just a moment.
[1:23:50] <Shock_Toaster> i think metro madness os a ref to sonic bts
[1:23:50] <%paladinstarbuster> @Loinclothiclese because i dont know the context in which these assets or game was created
[1:23:58] <theanora1> that's some sonic runways if I ever saw em
[1:24:01] <RoboticRexkek> SourPls
[1:24:03] <+KineKithZen> Wind, the AMERICA elementr
[1:24:25] <Jetsfantasy> Index 2 PogChamp
[1:24:29] <%paladinstarbuster> They have robots but no VR?
[1:24:32] <%Superbro64> you can blast in the left direction for more speed
[1:24:56] <andrei11dr> Well, we had robots but no VR
[1:25:01] <the7thdraconian> And I'm back
[1:25:08] <megamonmon123> woolie with the life lessons
[1:25:19] <biomegabear> so my only complain with the game is the levels might be a bit to long on my first playthrough but I think on multiple playthroughs that might be the point to find a fast route
[1:25:23] <@Solidus_113> Buffering Ads LUL
[1:25:39] <terribleusername> too fast LUL
[1:25:57] <Shock_Toaster> you should be fine, you built up enough of the meter for a second chance
[1:25:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:26:32] <%Superbro64> are you holding right through loops, or is your rotating your controls with the loop?
[1:26:40] <Vyneci> HOLY SHIT
[1:26:43] <%BackwardCap> 1st form?
[1:26:45] <%Superbro64> something weird with how that works might explain the spees drop?
[1:26:52] <@Solidus_113> NICE
[1:26:52] <daisyyyy> KILLDOZER
[1:27:00] <woodstock_hobbs> remember castilvania 2? i just ordered odin sphere
[1:27:25] <Shock_Toaster> bat os my fav ability in this game, wish it was in the sequel
[1:27:34] <%pectusumbra> the last minecart before the boss, yeah
[1:27:44] <%pectusumbra> with all the birds on the screen and the game slows down yeyeyeyee'
[1:27:53] <woodstock_hobbs> what would x2's fire dash do jumping off a mine cart
[1:28:04] <+Omgbasedjay> Itâ€™s like ristar and sonic had a aunt and uncle that me fell in love and had a baby @woolieversus
[1:28:04] <Daxalog> "intended"
[1:28:23] <Shock_Toaster> is that gravity?
[1:28:23] <1matheuw> new power
[1:28:28] <vstpnv> when you cut 7 dudes in one hit in No More Heroes and framerate drops to 10fps
[1:28:28] <Vyneci> You haven't
[1:28:30] <%pectusumbra> I mean they clearly tested that, saw it did slowdown, then went 'fuck it, that's rad'
[1:28:30] <mushplush77> I think that's Gravity
[1:28:30] <%trustycoyote> I love when emulators give you the option to keep the hardware limitations
[1:28:31] <%Superbro64> thats new
[1:28:50] <KeroKamina> No you didnâ€™t get that before
[1:29:00] <+Loinclothiclese> @trustycoyote sometimes i just love the jaggys and the way a game looked its always awesome.
[1:29:02] <@Solidus_113> We NIGHTS now
[1:29:02] <1matheuw> best power
[1:29:03] <woodstock_hobbs> what!
[1:29:05] <+KineKithZen> You're Magneto now

[1:29:10] <%paladinstarbuster> KHIGHTSU
[1:29:11] <%powerprotoman> the msot broken power in the game
[1:29:12] <Vyneci> Gravity is full movement but not great in combat
[1:29:14] <%chiluzza> yo thats cool
[1:29:15] <%powerprotoman> Nights mode
[1:29:15] <mushplush77> Rarest power in the game FYI
[1:29:18] <woodstock_hobbs> oh that's cool
[1:29:18] <LaikaCDP> we into dreams now boys
[1:29:20] <KeroKamina> Gravity rush
[1:29:21] <woodstock_hobbs> that's a game in itself
[1:29:21] <huskarl_zap> wheres reggie the hero?

[1:29:32] <%glass_marcus> Silver
[1:29:34] <Shock_Toaster> its pretty much like super sonic in advannce 3
[1:29:35] <andrei11dr> Fuckin Nights Into Dreams
[1:29:40] <Shock_Toaster> and rush
[1:29:41] <woodstock_hobbs> put it on wii
[1:29:49] <Daxalog> Whats that hat on the left of that gravity hat?
[1:29:56] <%arcielardor> he looks high
[1:29:56] <357Sneak> SourPls
[1:29:59] <biomegabear> @AnneSQF you can still get hit
[1:30:01] <+aishman> What the fuck is this game?
[1:30:01] <woodstock_hobbs> i have a fantasy off all the old systems comming back out and new games being released for them
[1:30:15] <%Merhabi> I cant tell if this is an old favorite or a new game, is Woolie pro at this?
[1:30:24] <daisyyyy> We Gravity Rush now
[1:30:25] <Shock_Toaster> new game ish
[1:30:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's new to him
[1:30:29] <%pectusumbra> this is newer, a game from 2017
[1:30:31] <Shock_Toaster> this game is like 2017
[1:30:44] <biomegabear> @WoolieVersus check out his idle animation as gravity
[1:30:51] <dukenux> nice, was about to ask how old this game is
[1:30:52] <%trustycoyote> @Loinclothiclese TOtally. That's why I love the scan line overlays. Back then they put in so much effort to make something look good by using the scanlines to smooth edges. MMX is a great example
[1:30:57] <mushplush77> Spark 2 came out in like mid 2019
[1:30:57] <%Merhabi> okay new to him, thanks yall
[1:31:04] <+aishman> This looks like
[1:31:04] <+KineKithZen> 8-way attacks? Sick
[1:31:05] <+aishman> 2d Nights
[1:31:19] <Shock_Toaster> nights without the .5
[1:31:27] <%alephalpha> it feels kinda slow though
[1:31:29] <Daxalog> This game feels like that kinda game I would want to make if I was a kid and knew how to do anything
[1:31:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'll never forgive capcom for having that ugly ass smoothing filter be the default in the zero collection
[1:31:52] <Shock_Toaster> this is a slower ability due it being op in mobility
[1:32:09] <KeroKamina> Punk robot
[1:32:21] <mushplush77> I believe there are only 10
[1:32:22] <%trustycoyote> Those guys look like the little muncher guys from TMNT.
[1:32:29] <KeroKamina> 12
[1:32:31] <vstpnv> chat, does sequel have more or less powerups?
[1:32:34] <mushplush77> Less
[1:32:37] <Shock_Toaster> less
[1:32:38] <mushplush77> it has 5 iirc
[1:32:42] <woodstock_hobbs> kirby superstar was one of the best games ever
[1:32:52] <woodstock_hobbs> the two player was so sonic 2
[1:32:59] <KeroKamina> And weâ€™re barely halfway done
[1:32:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:07] <Shock_Toaster> wish thi game was two player
[1:33:09] <daisyyyy> like youd think someone could have come up with a good scanline filter by now
[1:33:11] <biomegabear> green gurren on the right
[1:33:12] <Daxalog> Well atleast hes polite
[1:33:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> Milky Way Wishes is top 10
[1:33:15] <@Solidus_113> look at that gunmen
[1:33:19] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:33:20] <+Omgbasedjay> Kirby superstar could make superstar ultra infinity plus omega and Iâ€™ll buy it again
[1:33:27] <Daxalog> We out x20
[1:33:45] <@Solidus_113> That's literally Green Gurren
[1:33:58] <Daxalog> My god
[1:34:04] <%jiggy_snipe> this is so dumb LUL
[1:34:25] <%Merhabi> oh god
[1:34:31] <%Merhabi> it's a ganmen
[1:34:35] <%glass_marcus> this feels like sprite comic dialogue
[1:34:36] <Shock_Toaster> thats a fighting game char
[1:34:36] <biomegabear> does he throw his glasses at you
[1:34:38] <the7thdraconian> I wish we saw more hero villain interactions like this.

[1:45:11] <%Grayhammatter> EDGY
[1:45:15] <%0rond> oh shit there is an edgy version with a bloody knife?
[1:45:16] <%Livelinne> Is Reggie getting his well deserved rest?
[1:45:25] <@Solidus_113> you dash through the blue-green things
[1:45:28] <chromdad> and spark 2 is like a good 3d sonic mixed with REVENGEANCE
[1:45:28] <Shock_Toaster> edgey doesnt lose speed while going throigh loops
[1:45:52] <Shock_Toaster> as long as you hold the buttton
[1:45:56] <+KineKithZen> Welp
[1:45:56] <@Solidus_113> first death
[1:45:56] <%Grayhammatter> welp
[1:46:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> First Blood...
[1:46:13] <the7thdraconian> He just looked like he gave up on life.
[1:46:17] <KeroKamina> with a full yellow bare you could revive on the spot
[1:46:17] <mushplush77> No you lost Bat
[1:46:20] <andrei11dr> Welp that's the first one
[1:46:22] <biomegabear> So i ran the level trough with gravity and edgy
[1:46:25] <357Sneak> RPGGhosto
[1:46:26] <357Sneak> lytBODIED
[1:46:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> There's no extra lives system in this game?
[1:46:40] <Shock_Toaster> no
[1:46:46] <Shock_Toaster> you just kee[ going
[1:46:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> neat
[1:47:24] <Shock_Toaster> edgey can also airdash infinitely i believe
[1:47:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:47:46] <@Moobot> 1195 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:47:55] <+noajenkk> im a big fan of this character design
[1:47:58] <+noajenkk> looks cool
[1:48:04] <+patrickng714> the people that made this did Sonic fangames didnt they?
[1:48:09] <Shock_Toaster> yeah
[1:48:21] <Shock_Toaster> they made sonic after and before the sequel
[1:48:29] <KeroKamina> @patrickng714 sonic before the sequal and sonic after the sequal
[1:48:33] <Shock_Toaster> fire
[1:48:33] <KeroKamina> that's nto edgy that's fire
[1:48:36] <+patrickng714> cool
[1:48:39] <spectra_s02> It was only one dev who made everything but the music, had about 5+ composers for music
[1:48:56] <nvrwaker> the second one of these games looks kinda like sonic generations. Dev really seems like a sonic fan
[1:49:02] <Gieron667> so is this just kirby-sonic or what ?
[1:49:05] <DedlokPM> EDGY EDGY BISHI BISHI
[1:49:06] <%BackwardCap> Woolie: *Denies the existence of the enemy in front of them*
[1:49:07] <Shock_Toaster> both
[1:49:17] <%Merhabi> triple enemy next
[1:49:17] <mushplush77> @Gieron667 It's a mix of Sonic, Kirby and Mega Man
[1:49:21] <%Grayhammatter> EZ
[1:49:24] <%Merhabi> yeyeye
[1:49:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's Agni and Rundra, NOT an oni
[1:49:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> totally
[1:49:31] <mushplush77> Well, Mega Man X
[1:49:33] <andrei11dr> Edgy edgy edgy, breaky breaky breaky
[1:49:37] <Gieron667> and he has a hat like that one boss from kirby too
[1:49:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> X and Zero? PogChamp
[1:49:39] <Shock_Toaster> fire gets stronger the more it hits an enemy without you getting hit
[1:49:54] <dukenux> Which classic platformer this reminds you of the most, @WoolieVersus ?
[1:49:57] <+KineKithZen> Gat crab
[1:50:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Now the miniboss turned into a regular enemy just like an action game
[1:50:43] <Vyneci> He has Gravity in stock
[1:50:45] <Shock_Toaster> lel right
[1:51:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DED
[1:51:21] <dukenux> Main char reminds of NiGHTS a bit
[1:51:22] <biomegabear> can you gravity spam him
[1:51:24] <Gieron667> oh apparently there's a sequel to this game and it's a 3d sonic-like game
[1:51:26] <Shock_Toaster> its not random, thhe blue comes from using fire more and more
[1:51:57] <mushplush77> Well that just broke the boss
[1:52:06] <%paladinstarbuster> why did the music not change for the bossfight?
[1:52:18] <Shock_Toaster> its a miniboss i believe
[1:52:39] <%pectusumbra> okay, am I stupid, or did my donation just not work at all?
[1:52:40] <dukenux> it has a lifebar
[1:52:53] <Shock_Toaster> i didnt see a donation
[1:52:57] <megamonmon123> that robot with the sunglasses reminded me of scourge
[1:53:03] <nvrwaker> its like one of those sticky hands you get in the candy machine
[1:53:05] <megamonmon123> you guys remember scourge the hedgehog
[1:53:06] <dukenux> waterbending?
[1:53:06] <LaikaCDP> wow gravity is broken
[1:53:07] <%Grayhammatter> random goo fist
[1:53:22] <KeroKamina> alot of the powers are broken
[1:53:23] <Shock_Toaster> hah, missle arent real
[1:53:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> Those were cutscene missles
[1:53:34] <+noajenkk> such cool effects in this game
[1:53:35] <Profmcstevie> You saying Edge like that is bringing back some Catherine memories
[1:53:40] <+noajenkk> very appealing visually
[1:54:28] <dukenux> green arrow jester

[1:56:05] <megamonmon123> how doesnt gravity break the game?

[1:56:09] <Oneyeseesin3D> thiis music tho
[1:56:32] <%pectusumbra> Okay, that said donation processed. NOW it should do the go
[1:56:36] <woodstock_hobbs> crzy toys
[1:57:01] <mushplush77> @megamonmon123 Gravity is flight, it also has some good damage in its dashes in all directions
[1:57:03] <Torgue_1> Is Woolie playing this for the first time? I missed the start of the stream.
[1:57:07] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:57:13] <+gustavozxd> how old is this game
[1:57:17] <@Solidus_113> 2017
[1:57:24] <DedlokPM> Huh. The Archer class is really made up of archers!
[1:57:26] <InXplotch> only a few years, yeah
[1:58:01] <+gustavozxd> the name sounds like its from the 90s but it does look a little too good for that
[1:58:02] <Torgue_1> Huh, I thought it was from 2015
[1:58:03] <%paladinstarbuster> Green +Archer=GARCHER
[1:58:11] <Profmcstevie> Ah I see, explosive "clip" of sorts
[1:58:17] <Daxalog> Can you jump on the arrows that land in the wall?
[1:58:18] <cheaddos> is this on PC or SNES?
[1:58:20] <dukenux> SAVE
[1:58:24] <andrei11dr> The Jester dude looks high of his ass when he goes into Gravity mode
[1:58:53] <dukenux> do all the ferris wheel thingies serve as a medpack stations?

[2:01:03] <dukenux> "I don't understand."
[2:01:05] <Daxalog> Wow
[2:01:12] <derap41> This dialog does not match this art tone
[2:01:17] <biomegabear> dialouge is not this games strong suit
[2:01:23] <%Superbro64> with your apartment that you can't pay the rebt for.
[2:01:24] <Daxalog> Jester spittin that truth

[2:11:27] <JohnDRadical> Was this game originally 3D or is this a sequel?
[2:11:37] <gekizenbu> the 3d one is the sequel
[2:11:50] <+fetrigon> ^
[2:11:50] <JohnDRadical> Oh. Thanks geki
[2:11:50] <mushplush77> Spark 2 is 3D
[2:12:30] <biomegabear> sometimes unclear if something can hurt you or not
[2:12:36] <biomegabear> in terms of obsticles
[2:12:38] <+fetrigon> The backgrounds are great!

[2:15:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:16:13] <%paladinstarbuster> they do
[2:16:22] <%floralkami> ngl, I've only seen this little bit of this game so far, but it's looking far more cooler and up my alley than anything I've played in the Sonic series.
[2:16:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Megaman and the Amazing Mirror X3 and Knuckles
[2:16:23] <$JobbedBone> !raffle

[2:17:53] <@Solidus_113> ball pit
[2:18:15] <Vyneci> BTW board makes this level a trip
[2:18:17] <QuestionableDes> momentum is odd in this game
[2:18:43] <LaikaCDP> marx also with the similar jester hat
[2:18:58] <dukenux> NANOMACHINES
[2:18:58] <%jiggy_snipe> PogChamp
[2:19:00] <the7thdraconian> It's the fucking pick pocket
[2:19:09] <@Menitta> How neat is that
[2:19:12] <the7thdraconian> I love the dialogue in this game.
[2:19:14] <%Daba_mk2> lol
[2:19:14] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @KeroKamina
[2:19:15] <spectra_s02> Fave boss tbh
[2:19:17] <the7thdraconian> It's so casual.
[2:19:25] <dukenux> -_-
[2:19:33] <%Daba_mk2> thats cool
[2:19:35] <the7thdraconian> Reminds me of Sonic Boom
[2:19:41] <the7thdraconian> The show, not the game.
[2:19:42] <heartlesshealer> feels like old webcomics writing
[2:19:50] <357Sneak> botaniMad PowerUpR nktakuSad_SQ
[2:19:54] <%tearfuldevil> writing isn't as good as Sonic Boom the show
[2:20:15] <@Solidus_113> this is like Warioware
[2:20:30] <%tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 on what planet do you think the fans effect smash entry do any major extent
[2:20:43] <woodstock_hobbs> fan made games made fast
[2:20:48] <@Solidus_113> That TV static is going to kill the bitrate
[2:20:52] <%Daba_mk2> damn
[2:20:55] <KeroKamina> indeed
[2:21:06] <%Superbro64> fangame with good gameplay, writing, level design, characters, and music are rare enough to not exist
[2:21:11] <woodstock_hobbs> play them on a lets play channel with a website that allows people to download them for free
[2:21:15] <heartlesshealer> stand beneath the jehuty form?
[2:21:28] <%Superbro64> tho to be fair, this is an original game.
[2:21:46] <+Itselguapo> dat kirb reference
[2:21:51] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months!
[2:21:57] <%tearfuldevil> @Superbro64 it's an "original" game
[2:22:24] <%tearfuldevil> this part of the fight is RAD
[2:22:26] <heartlesshealer> ah, the explosion is smaller than I thought
[2:22:39] <the7thdraconian> These are some well designed boss encounters, all around.
[2:22:40] <Klefth> Music was cool
[2:22:40] <%Superbro64> I imagine the righting is on par with the last sonic fangame he made
[2:22:40] <%tearfuldevil> love the star's n space ship in the background
[2:22:47] <%Superbro64> the metroidvania one
[2:22:50] <%Daba_mk2> thats cold
[2:22:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[2:22:58] <Vyneci> Aw yeah more chill jams SourPls
[2:22:58] <357Sneak> SourPls
[2:23:00] <KeroKamina> you're gonna loveo ne of the next levels @tearfuldevil
[2:23:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> did you get the wallet back?
[2:23:03] <dukenux> i hope he's not
[2:23:11] <dukenux> he seemed like a fun enemy
[2:23:18] <biomegabear> thrtrd s gravity in this stage
[2:23:22] <+Itselguapo> edge knight
[2:23:26] <DedlokPM> EDGY EDGY BISHI BISHI BREAKY BREAKY
[2:23:28] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:23:30] <%floralkami> OH this is a Steam game??? I thought it was an old Sonic competitor since I saw some other person creating a 3D fangame for it in the style of the Sonic 3d games
[2:23:35] <KeroKamina> this beat tho
[2:23:37] <Klefth> And music continues to be cool. Damn
[2:24:19] <%Superbro64> hammer just melts enemies though
[2:24:21] <%floralkami> so yeah, I'm DEFINITELY liking this a lot more than than Sonic series
[2:24:22] <mushplush77> @floralkami That game was probably Spark 2, a game from last year
[2:24:39] <KeroKamina> Spark 2 is the 3D one yes
[2:24:42] <Vyneci> THE BEES
[2:25:42] <%floralkami> @mussyplussy yeah, that one didn't interest me so that much cause I hate 3D Sonic mechanics like that inane lack of friction for 3D platforming...
[2:25:42] <KeroKamina> like the sonix CD fireflies
[2:26:11] <VectorSatyr> This entire OST is lit.
[2:26:17] <KeroKamina> @floralkami Spark 2 is worth checkign out, probably the best sonic game i've played in years not made by sonic team
[2:26:19] <Vyneci> This OST is on Spotify BTW @WoolieVersus
[2:26:20] <VectorSatyr> It only gets better from here.
[2:26:23] <%Daba_mk2> it Is pretty good
[2:26:28] <KeroKamina> oh shit nice
[2:26:40] <+Chazmosis> The composer is a dude who goes by the name Funk Fiction. Check his stuff out
[2:26:41] <ObsceneKvng> yes loving the music ðŸŽ¶
[2:27:03] <Klefth> Nothing beats just buying the album/ost and poweramp
[2:27:07] <%Superbro64> there's a official youtube playlist on his channel, yes
[2:27:09] <the7thdraconian> It's got some good options for finding new music, so I like it.
[2:27:11] <VectorSatyr> To clarify what @Chazmosis said, Funk Fiction composed THIS song. There's, like, multiple composers on the OST.
[2:27:17] <unclerizla> but when you wanna listen to OK Computer on your daily commute, you cant really use yuotube
[2:27:33] <%tearfuldevil> i'm too used to pirating anything maisntream, and buying shit on bandcamp or whatever if its small dev or indie musician
[2:27:34] <+Chazmosis> @VectorSatyr You're right. My bad
[2:27:39] <%tearfuldevil> never gonna use spotify
[2:28:02] <InXplotch> spotify is so convenient though
[2:28:09] <%tearfuldevil> not relaly?
[2:28:09] <Yakjak> What's better, this or Freedom Planet?
[2:28:17] <Vyneci> Oh yeah, this is also on Bandcamp if I'm not mistaken
[2:28:28] <%tearfuldevil> i have all the music i want to listen to on my phone (and comp) for whenever i want to
[2:28:28] <%Superbro64> if spotify allowed me to actually listen to things without making an account first, maybe I would have an higher opinion of it
[2:28:30] <VectorSatyr> Not gonna answer that.
[2:28:36] <%BinaryFireball> spotify is least convenient
[2:28:44] <unclerizla> @Superbro64 its a paid service
[2:28:46] <InXplotch> I mean I have premium so iunno
[2:28:51] <%Dr_DangerPhD> spotify premium let's you stream 320 kbps audio, good if you own decent headphones
[2:28:54] <%Superbro64> its neat that tekken soundtracks are on it tho
[2:28:59] <InXplotch> I've not had issues with it ever
[2:29:01] <%BinaryFireball> prime music is pretty decent
[2:29:26] <unclerizla> Google Play music also works fine, if you wanna give your money to a mega-corporation that is not spotify
[2:29:41] <shin_marx> Salty bet ost
[2:29:47] <%BinaryFireball> I mean I already am because prime is still a fucking good deal
[2:29:59] <penitentpentwitch> A remix of a remix of a remix, as long as it sounds good
[2:30:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:30:00] <InXplotch> google play music is kind of a hassle sometimes from my experience, but it's probably improved since I last used it
[2:30:13] <InXplotch> I do still use it as a backup for my personal library
[2:30:21] <%Superbro64> really depends on how popular this game and its ost is in the long run
[2:30:26] <%BinaryFireball> I don't really just listen to music though anymore which makes me sad
[2:30:27] <Profmcstevie> We're already in the future of twice remixed soundtracks
[2:30:28] <dukenux> it's hip Kappa
[2:30:34] <%BinaryFireball> unless im working
[2:30:36] <unclerizla> @Binary_Fireball hate giving my money to Bezos, but damn if he doesnt have a lot of stuff I want
[2:30:40] <%Superbro64> sonic bts and ats had some GLORIOUS remixes from their games
[2:30:49] <dukenux> ohey, green arrow guy
[2:31:28] <%shry7> !uptime
[2:31:28] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 45 minutes
[2:31:30] <dukenux> is there a bonus if you fight this guys with abilities that mirror theirs
[2:31:42] <VectorSatyr> @dukenux No.
[2:31:50] <KeroKamina> the onyl ability we haven't seen you use yet is Ice
[2:32:10] <strifer413> magic too I think
[2:32:12] <VectorSatyr> @KeroKamina Was Magic used?
[2:32:25] <@Solidus_113> Start of game: "oh man all these abilities are cool and useful" Now: Gravity or nothing else
[2:32:27] <%Superbro64> "shoot that motherf-!"
[2:32:28] <dukenux> he picked magic before
[2:32:34] <KeroKamina> wait as in mage magic or the oen wiht hte wand? @VectorSatyr
[2:32:36] <andrei11dr> We saw magic
[2:32:41] <KeroKamina> becasue the oen with the wand wasn't used yet
[2:32:44] <VectorSatyr> Wand.
[2:32:45] <dukenux> we saw a wizard hat one
[2:32:52] <dukenux> the blue one
[2:32:56] <andrei11dr> I think we saw 10 of them
[2:33:08] <VectorSatyr> Can't wait to see him use that one.
[2:33:13] <KeroKamina> wand wasn't used yet
[2:33:24] <KeroKamina> so yeah we havne't seen wand and ice
[2:33:45] <strifer413> I don't remember much from this game except that there was an absolutely insane skateboard level up ahead
[2:33:50] <Klefth> enbMusic enbMusic enbMusic
[2:34:02] <andrei11dr> Wizard is the Hadoken one right?
[2:34:04] <VectorSatyr> More like Sandboarding.
[2:34:08] <%Superbro64> is this the level with the maze?
[2:34:08] <Vyneci> I think that's the next level
[2:34:18] <VectorSatyr> @Superbro64 No.
[2:36:03] <$Invlux> Jebaited
[2:36:07] <biomegabear> level design seems strange when its not being sonic-like
[2:36:15] <strifer413> I hope Woolie ends up playing Spark 2. While not as polished as this one, it's a great 3d sonic which is rare
[2:36:24] <%Superbro64> Jebaited
[2:37:11] <%BinaryFireball> haaaat
[2:37:11] <%Superbro64> If only we had an ability, that allows us to move through the stage freely, in the air.. Kappa
[2:37:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:37:15] <dukenux> face it
[2:37:17] <%jiggy_snipe> no gravity for you
[2:37:20] <%BinaryFireball> because hats are coool
[2:37:22] <dukenux> nothing will live up to gravity
[2:37:27] <KeroKamina> oh god i don't think this is good for this boss

[2:37:55] <biomegabear> yeah
[2:38:24] <@Solidus_113> Satsuki Kiryuin is at the top of that tower
[2:38:25] <Vyneci> Try to build a full bar and then use the charge beam with mage
[2:38:37] <%Superbro64> Lake feperd in an interview did state that he made more inspiration then the obvious when making this game
[2:38:50] <%Superbro64> *had
[2:39:01] <strifer413> Satsuki's godrays are still just the best thing ever
[2:39:25] <spectra_s02> fun fact, this boss was made with a 3D model

[2:40:00] <dukenux> "Let's call it a draw"
[2:40:48] <1matheuw> oh shit is woolie gonna finish the game?
[2:41:55] <strifer413> welp this feels like trying to fight a soul boss with wheel. GG
[2:41:57] <%glass_marcus> this is a tanky boy
[2:42:15] <dukenux> loads of hp on this boi
[2:42:37] <%Superbro64> dang, if only we had a certain ability, that would allow us to float around and avoid damage completely. If only... Kappa
[2:42:43] <Vyneci> It looks like it's better to just mash than to ever use the charged attack
[2:42:46] <dukenux> Stinger! Stinger! Stinger!

[2:54:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Not my sonic
[2:54:12] <+TheOneCalledRock> didn't the devs make a 3D spark game too?
[2:54:13] <mrmister681> a jester who happens to be a spark
[2:54:15] <%Superbro64> I mean, what sonic levels? Aren't they all like that already?
[2:54:23] <mushplush77> Speak is electricity who wanted to be an engineer but couldn't get a job because robots did everything
[2:54:33] <ObsceneKvng> hence why I like sonic colors
[2:54:40] <mushplush77> So he joined a circus and was then replaced
[2:54:44] <mrmister681> @TheOneCalledRock yeah, you play as the robot in that one. It tries to have dmc combat too
[2:54:50] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Superbro64 depends who you talking too. Many people have different opinions on sonic levels OpieOP

[3:02:07] <+kralec> @WoolieVersus also, I say "gonna" which isn't really a word. that's a southern smooshed word. so you get a phrase that sounds like I'mgonnagedadrink" which is "i'm going to get a drink" but slurred to all hell

[3:02:51] <+TheOneCalledRock> @SkyOceanGames where to begin! well to keep it small, the whole game was horrible developed, like beta footage was better that final footage
[3:02:52] <+jetjagger222> a little too raph
[3:02:52] <woodstock_hobbs> needs 3d map line drawing

[3:04:17] <penitentpentwitch> I still find it funny "y'all" is one of the few third person group identifications in english that parallels "ustedes" in spanish
[3:04:19] <kamichilli> kamen rider 02
[3:04:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> notice how this dude doesnt have a health bar. hes that special
[3:04:40] <VectorSatyr> I don't remember, but I think that's a bug.
[3:04:49] <woodstock_hobbs> what's the deal with auto levels on donkey kong
[3:04:50] <mushplush77> Yeah I don't think that's supposed to happen
[3:04:53] <dukenux> PogChamp
[3:04:56] <%gatorafan> that bug's special too
[3:04:57] <+YabbaTroll> uhhh
[3:05:04] <@Solidus_113> that was a divekick
[3:05:14] <penitentpentwitch> Plot twist, you killed the hero?
[3:05:14] <%Broand> I hear some people like no mans sky now, No clue why, game is still as broad as the ocean and as shallow as a puddle
[3:05:16] <KeroKamina> i beleive that was the true final boss
[3:05:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> @KeroKamina and i will always mega respect respect hello games for sticking to their guns and fixing what was broke, not many devs can say that
[3:05:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:05:24] <+jetjagger222> naruhodo
[3:05:33] <mrmister681> he has Shadow shoes

[3:05:38] <%gatorafan> look at this Sonic OC
[3:05:48] <+jetjagger222> he's got the sazabi helmet
[3:05:51] <anarchistPastry> this dude reminds me of mecha sonic

[3:06:58] <%gatorafan> that guy was BUILT with the edge powerup
[3:07:02] <WanderingSwordsman> This all started with him wanting his job back
[3:07:06] <+EySoyCoco> your type
[3:07:12] <+TheOneCalledRock> this game is giving me flashbacks to watching sonic sprite videos and playing sonic fan games on new grounds back i the day
[3:07:16] <+TheOneCalledRock> these are good feelings
[3:07:20] <+jetjagger222> taito-ass BGM
[3:07:41] <%BinaryFireball> my biggest gripe with sonic games is that I think it wants me to go fast and then it hits me with a big wall killing my flow
[3:07:53] <Klefth> Mmmm, mm, this music
[3:07:56] <%BinaryFireball> and Im like.... but that was the point, to go fast!?
[3:07:58] <+fetrigon> mmmmmm
[3:08:04] <KeroKamina> them violins tho
[3:08:07] <+TheOneCalledRock> the VIOLINS

[3:08:27] <Klefth> enbMusic enbMusic enbMusic enbMusic
[3:08:30] <%BinaryFireball> is this what old persona music sounds like?
[3:08:32] <%Superbro64> The song is sad cuz homie is ded BibleThump
[3:08:33] <+jetjagger222> just needs the opera samples and it'll sound exactly like a zuntata track
[3:08:35] <KeroKamina> reminds me a bit of Kingdom Valley a little bit
[3:08:40] <Profmcstevie> It feels a little....persona honestly
[3:08:54] <wunderkindest> This is some Ys overworld exploration music
[3:09:01] <KeroKamina> THIS VIOLIN IS GOING HAM
[3:09:01] <penitentpentwitch> Avenge your homie! Eat Big Smoke's order.
[3:09:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> ok dis hard

[3:09:21] <+fetrigon> 20k well spent
[3:09:21] <%Superbro64> Help! I'm trying to play this platformer, but I can't control my body from groovin to these sick beats!
[3:09:21] <357Sneak> for the Homie zoneMayoSquirt lytWAH
[3:09:26] <+x_geist> Persona regular world music
[3:09:34] <andrei11dr> This part of the song kinda reminds me of FFX
[3:09:53] <%BinaryFireball> it would be a dope mechanic if you got secret powerups by moving to the beat
[3:10:20] <%BinaryFireball> but not like crypt of the necrodancer where it's required
[3:10:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> I wonder how speedruns of this game look
[3:10:59] <VCryas> Sounds like a megaman sound track to me
[3:11:04] <%jiggy_snipe> a cutscene where the party does cool stuff
[3:11:06] <DarthTaco> @Binary_Fireball took me a bit to think of what to write but; being able to go fast in sonic games has a lot to do with memorization
[3:11:18] <+noajenkk> thats slick
[3:11:20] <DarthTaco> and you did get spiked, but you also had rings so you just keep going
[3:11:29] <andrei11dr> There was a guy in here who said he speedrunned this
[3:11:29] <wunderkindest> The music definitely gives me some Falcom vibes
[3:11:33] <VCryas> Also a speedrun of this game would be sick
[3:11:35] <DarthTaco> and can do it better next time
[3:11:41] <LaikaCDP> I'm gonna need to find some wallpapers
[3:11:52] <+jetjagger222> the piano is a bit reminiscent of akira's theme from VF5R
[3:11:57] <DingusMcBaseball> fast
[3:12:10] <%BinaryFireball> @DarthTaco Yea I eventually learned that it's a skill and something you have to work toward but as a kid that's not what I wanted
[3:12:13] <%Superbro64> man, if woolie plays spark 2 at some point in the future, I will be over the future.
[3:12:22] <%BinaryFireball> I should try replaying one but I have no idea which one to try
[3:12:30] <%gatorafan> this music is amazing
[3:12:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:12:32] <%Superbro64> spark 2 is those 3d sonic fangames realized as a product you can buy with money
[3:12:52] <KeroKamina> iirc firel ets you walk on and in lava in this level
[3:12:56] <andrei11dr> This background esthetic is giving me some strong Alien Soldier vibes
[3:13:10] <KeroKamina> oh wait no it was this fire shield
[3:13:13] <DingusMcBaseball> you did one there
[3:13:14] <RetroDLC> Oh hey, I was one of the backers for this Kickstarter
[3:13:25] <+fetrigon> They made 10k on Kickstarter for music and sound design. My mistake :Z
[3:13:27] <%BinaryFireball> the memorization was super frustrating, I didn't want to memorize I wanted to see what was coming and be able to dodge but the camera was too limited
[3:13:47] <DarthTaco> i mean you didnt die, you just keep going
[3:14:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> i need to start backing games, but i'm so scared to lose my money LUL i missed out on the W101 kickstarter and i'm sad about that
[3:14:10] <DarthTaco> i never really thought about it as a kid
[3:14:23] <DarthTaco> i just brute forced my way through things
[3:14:25] <RetroDLC> I regret not backing Undertale and Hollow Knight
[3:14:34] <DarthTaco> cause sonic is made so you can do that
[3:14:41] <RetroDLC> Just as much as I regret buying Bitcoin when it started up
[3:14:42] <%BinaryFireball> oh I also never bought it so my play sessions were always short
[3:15:00] <RetroDLC> *not buying, rather
[3:15:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> you think that's bad? the first game I ever backed was MN9 NotLikeThis
[3:15:07] <+TheOneCalledRock> OOF
[3:15:09] <+fetrigon> F
[3:15:17] <KaiserMario> Why is Woolie solo today?
[3:15:18] <%BinaryFireball> MN9?
[3:15:22] <RetroDLC> I think that was my first KS too
[3:15:25] <%Broand> I backed starbound
[3:15:25] <SomariMan> I backed this on Kickstarter for the music. I'm so glad I did.
[3:15:27] <KeroKamina> @KaiserMario reggie is sick
[3:15:28] <+TheOneCalledRock> and that's what i am afraid of, to back another mighty number 9
[3:15:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> mighty number 9
[3:15:31] <%Broand> I regret it every day
[3:15:32] <biomegabear> @FuqBoiSlim nah, you put in money for a good intetion
[3:15:33] <%BinaryFireball> oooh
[3:15:34] <mrmister681> I like solo, it's pretty chill
[3:15:38] <rcand9> the saves look massively out of place with these nice backgrounds
[3:15:48] <KaiserMario> oh, I hope Reggie gets better soon
[3:16:31] <andrei11dr> Mighty Nr. 9 at least showed us who Inefune really was !
[3:16:44] <%BinaryFireball> me too Reggie's smile is like a golden ray of sunlight after a nasty storm. The world is a more grim and desolate place without his infectious charisma
[3:16:58] <VectorSatyr> That was my favorite level in the game.

[3:26:59] <VectorSatyr> No.
[3:27:01] <+TheOneCalledRock> nope
[3:27:02] <@Solidus_113> Belka from Ace Combat has it, but still fiction
[3:27:02] <spectra_s02> Nope
[3:27:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> NonBinaryPride
[3:27:06] <Profmcstevie> Flags throughout history definitely have it, some old Russian one if I recalls
[3:27:07] <KeroKamina> completely different team
[3:27:31] <+TheOneCalledRock> WEEEEEE
[3:27:34] <+Koover> speed o clock

[3:29:05] <rcand9> oh ye
[3:29:05] <LVDoomien> my task is complete
[3:29:06] <KeroKamina> i loved when it happend in the sonic advanced games aswell, which added after images
[3:29:06] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeyeyey i mentioned that earlier, that shit so good
[3:29:13] <penitentpentwitch> Although that makes it real easy to hit stuff offscreen
[3:29:15] <LVDoomien> enjoy the rest of the stream gamers
[3:29:19] <%Superbro64> chemical plant, hydrocity
[3:29:22] <biomegabear> gravity
[3:29:40] <%Superbro64> problem is, you SPEED past like, weeks worth of level design that way
[3:29:40] <rcand9> sonic rush was pretty good at that
[3:29:58] <+x_geist> F for gravity
[3:30:08] <%Superbro64> sonic team literally had to come up with an engine to deal with the fact that in 3d, you speed by content TOO fast
[3:30:17] <%Superbro64> for unleashed and so
[3:30:17] <@Solidus_113> GRAV BACK
[3:30:22] <+fetrigon> @kerokamina Yeah click team fusion is a bitch to port to other consoles and I think he needs a connect that can "validate" him as a trustworthy dev to console makers.
[3:30:27] <DarthTaco> its a problem they havent fixed yet
[3:30:28] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think sonic rush had a nice balance with speed a level design. the sonic advance games as well
[3:30:31] <+x_geist> woot!
[3:30:37] <DarthTaco> the hedgehog engine is for lighting
[3:30:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> I thought Woolie gave up on gravity and went full Boardmaster LUL
[3:30:56] <KeroKamina> gotta speed keed
[3:31:00] <DarthTaco> but yea that is why forces had so many short levels and generations only had a few long levels
[3:31:25] <KeroKamina> we truely are the Sonic Riders Zero Gravity
[3:31:25] <%Superbro64> generations had more 2d sections I feel
[3:31:26] <@Solidus_113> You're on a train now
[3:31:33] <Dodolo212> Woolie condones speeding
[3:31:36] <%BisoromiBear> ???

[3:36:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Gravity just deletes the boss encounters
[3:36:38] <%gatorafan> Imagine being tied to the laws of physics LUL
[3:36:39] <emeraldskrull> living in a jesterific clown world.
[3:36:41] <biomegabear> DDo you believe in gravity Puchi?

[3:41:41] <penitentpentwitch> My only problem with piloting Mecha in Doom Eternal is how much slower the gameplay would be
[3:41:54] <+jetjagger222> not all games can be metal slug
[3:42:24] <%Superbro64> Kamiya is FURIOUSLY calling his team at platinum to make sure that no mechs will be piloted, but WILL BE SEEN, in his ultraman game

[3:49:08] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:49:16] <andrei11dr> For some reason, my mind went to that Ryu description from one of the SF guides, where it says "Ryu has no friends, no family and no life" LUL
[3:49:24] <KeroKamina> i think the light attack stuns you
[3:49:25] <%floralkami> wow, back to back bosses
[3:49:46] <KeroKamina> atleast you have that backup bar
[3:49:48] <AstratesticoMan> the bosses look cooler than they fight
[3:49:57] <The_Maddness> do the saves not bring you back at full?
[3:49:58] <%floralkami> he FLASHED YOU
[3:50:00] <penitentpentwitch> Isn't that a precursor of the end?
[3:50:25] <%floralkami> fucking tos destroying robot
[3:50:27] <KeroKamina> @AstratesticoMan to be fair he's cheesign these bosses hard

[3:51:29] <andrei11dr> Almost there
[3:51:38] <KeroKamina> it is
[3:51:41] <KeroKamina> that's why it's so rare
[3:52:01] <%Superbro64> I imagine gravity is hardly used by speedrunners, as it takes literally forever
[3:52:03] <%Damie904> It's super sonic with a way lower damage output, so yea
