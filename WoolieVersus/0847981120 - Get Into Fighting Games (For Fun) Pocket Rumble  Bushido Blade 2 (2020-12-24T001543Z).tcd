[0:18:20] <%ggbhtg> @prevot that's Pikkon
[0:18:33] <%ggbhtg> Alpha 3 UPPER was too good

[0:18:59] <destinyspider> Shoryuken, huh?
[0:19:00] <%ggbhtg> too much love for a GBA "port"
[0:19:01] <AfternoonConcession> this game is easier with pad with thos corner inputs
[0:19:10] <andrewofbob> Tap for normal, hold for special
[0:19:15] <+spardanwarrior> Yeah neither of the publishers have any mention of Pocket Rumble on their sites. Really wierd.
[0:19:32] <AfternoonConcession> you can macro buttons to only tap even if you hold them
[0:19:54] <%ggbhtg> Publishers can be assholes. COUGH Skullgirls COUGH
[0:19:57] <+spardanwarrior> And considering one of those publishers is Dangen...
[0:20:25] <+spardanwarrior> Or at least that's whats coming up when I google Pocket Rumble
[0:20:45] <T_Sasquatch> is this game out now ?

[0:22:29] <destinyspider> Talking about hitboxes. You ever saw one of these Guilty Gear clash videos, Woolz?
[0:22:50] <destinyspider> That shit is badass
[0:22:55] <BloodiaMK2> What system Pocket Rumble is on?
[0:23:05] <AfternoonConcession> steam and switch
[0:23:10] <%YeetBoss> switch pc
[0:23:51] <%ggbhtg> girl Terry btw
[0:24:01] <AfternoonConcession> every character is different the same way KI has differenct characters
[0:24:18] <%ggbhtg> That's gotta be girl Terry if she has a Run
[0:24:28] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:24:31] <+Purple_Shirt> specials give meter for Tenchi. Each character gets super in a different way
[0:24:32] <%ggbhtg> Hao ShoKouKen
[0:24:32] <%BackwardCap> Everyone has unique meter mechanics in this game. Tenchi gains a pip every time he uses a special move. Doesn't need to hit.
[0:24:38] <FacetiousAF> FeelsBadMan i just tried to rewind because i'm used to being in the anime audience
[0:24:55] <andrewofbob> One character’s dash is an attack with self damage, charging the super to get the health back
[0:25:11] <%jiggy_snipe> big punches PogChamp
[0:25:20] <AfternoonConcession> gotta chunk to gain super meter
[0:25:22] <%ggbhtg> Ryo punches
[0:25:30] <%ggbhtg> and fucking CAPTAIN CORRIDOR
[0:25:33] <FacetiousAF> 🤔 are those bandages or brass knuckles?
[0:25:50] <%Oak_bogle> Yes
[0:26:03] <destinyspider> Jam kicks
[0:26:13] <%ggbhtg> The slam down move is probably some SNK boss I cant recall like Krizalid
[0:26:24] <%ggbhtg> but yo
[0:26:27] <%kyh9> You mean Vergil
[0:26:31] <%ggbhtg> fucking CAPTAIN CORRIDOR
[0:26:31] <BackwardCap> Rapid Slash

[0:27:54] <%ggbhtg> Ms Fortune huh
[0:28:01] <%BackwardCap> Hector can't actually kill himself with it, so 1hp = berserk mode.
[0:28:05] <destinyspider> Zato=1
[0:28:06] <SableS139a> Why is that animation so damn smooth?

[0:36:40] <Kyanta_Rojo> Man I hope they Woolie opens up lobbies for this. It's been a while since I touched this game but it's fun.
[0:37:09] <Kyanta_Rojo> Naomi is really neat since the charges allow her to combine her moves into more powerful ex versions for her meter
[0:37:25] <%gitgouda> i love how this game looks
[0:37:26] <Kyanta_Rojo> Super high damage combos if you learn her EX move combos
[0:37:44] <+skylerpilot> Naomi can strait up kill you in like 2 combos and has a nasty mix up game
[0:37:51] <AfternoonConcession> you cann combo jump in into light light
[0:37:52] <%ggbhtg> Summer Salt

[0:39:09] <%ggbhtg> Endoukuuuuuken
[0:39:10] <%BackwardCap> You can dash jump over fireballs
[0:39:17] <AfternoonConcession> the jump over doesn't do damage until she hits the ground

[0:56:11] <%YeetBoss> can i sell my ps4 with cyberpunk on is for a shitzillion dollars
[0:56:38] <FacetiousAF> nah PT was an amazing experience. cyberpunk is/was... messy.
[0:56:38] <+pectusumbra> @YeetBoss but it's a bad match for him to do that since confirms give June the wisps for meter

[0:57:19] <FacetiousAF> gotteeemmmmmm
[0:57:24] <AfternoonConcession> round 5 bois
[0:57:28] <AfternoonConcession> hype music
[0:57:34] <FacetiousAF> i was gonna play yakuza with this in the bg LUL
[0:57:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> SourPls
[0:57:52] <AfternoonConcession> almost
[0:57:58] <%ggbhtg> da nootch is real
[0:58:00] <%BackwardCap> Wow
[0:58:00] <FacetiousAF> 🅱️ aited
[0:58:20] <+lumporr> guys holy fuck i've been getting stomped by the cpu
[0:58:24] <+lumporr> jesus fuck
[0:58:31] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_SA
[0:58:46] <+pectusumbra> yeah that was always a thing in this game, the computer is fucked
[0:58:51] <AfternoonConcession> 10 bucks guys, best "easy" fighting game
[0:58:53] <+lumporr> ok thank god
[0:58:53] <%BackwardCap> You can kill the cat btw.
[0:59:30] <FacetiousAF> man i really don't feel these puppet characters
[0:59:33] <AfternoonConcession> it's very pad friendly too because all special move inputs are DF/DB + button
[0:59:50] <Kyanta_Rojo> Keiko is tough but fun
[0:59:53] <AfternoonConcession> you can move the cat in block stun too
[0:59:53] <+therockettorussia> i love this game
[1:00:02] <Kyanta_Rojo> All Keiko's specials are the cat
[1:00:07] <Kyanta_Rojo> meaning unblockable setups
[1:00:07] <FacetiousAF> @rockettorussiacmc from what i've seen tonight this is ssuuuuuppper legit
[1:00:13] <Kyanta_Rojo> but cat management is hard
[1:00:37] <%BackwardCap> Rip
[1:00:44] <Kyanta_Rojo> Without the cat she's the worst character in the game
[1:00:47] <townzzzzz> kill your cat for more on the time
[1:00:50] <Kyanta_Rojo> only normals, no combos
[1:01:09] <+Mocking_Jason> good advice for real life as well
[1:01:18] <AfternoonConcession> it should be just 2 damage but you can place her anywhere
[1:01:35] <Kyanta_Rojo> The cat can be hit too during it's movement
[1:01:41] <Kyanta_Rojo> if it loses all it's health he dies
[1:01:47] <%xeromage> telekinetic slurm hands!
[1:01:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> do NOT kill the cat it will give you LESS time on the clock if anything pokemoF
[1:02:12] <Kyanta_Rojo> cat has a DP
[1:02:24] <AfternoonConcession> the best part about simple fighting games is that it's easy to learn multiple characters
[1:03:20] <FacetiousAF> remember: kill the cat to parry Kappa
[1:03:41] <agianttornado> Parker in Pink = Yoshikage Kira

[1:08:30] <%YeetBoss> YeetBoss subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:09:08] <%alexisofthestars> Are they playing on GGPO or Parsec?
[1:09:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think Jago is p cool. I don't play much KI tho
[1:09:25] <FacetiousAF> jago: let's give ryu a sword
[1:09:30] <%ggbhtg> soft Team Play mode huh
[1:09:32] <destinyspider> They're playing on local
[1:09:37] <%alexisofthestars> Oh ok
[1:09:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> @alexisofthestars GGPO at the start but if its too dry they'll switch to parsec
[1:09:48] <%ggbhtg> @alexisofthestars First one then the other
[1:09:50] <+arcforged> Whats good Woolie
[1:09:50] <%ggbhtg> but later
[1:09:52] <Kyanta_Rojo> Tenchi can go fairly even in the fireball war with June
[1:09:56] <%alexisofthestars> Perfect, thanks :)
[1:10:08] <%BackwardCap> You can salty switch to your main on the final round instead of next game woolieMIRIN
[1:10:10] <majinken> @woolieversus June is the best got so many players to rage quit
[1:10:15] <%ggbhtg> put her in a coffin!
[1:10:16] <%YeetBoss> june has Jack-0 vibes
[1:10:25] <destinyspider> I never played KI. It looks cool tho
[1:10:27] <%PlateProp> PlateProp subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:10:33] <Kyanta_Rojo> and every fireball thrown is free meter so you can chip kill her if she doesn't play around it forcing her to go in and play her Disjoints vs Tenshi DP
[1:10:34] <destinyspider> Isn't it Xbox exclusive?
[1:10:38] <hamborgini> Thanks for the 2020Unity @plateprop
[1:10:59] <FacetiousAF> no destiny its also on steam
[1:11:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:19:51] <%RyuuAoi> , the jacket comin OFF!
[1:19:53] <$infinite_rotation> This was my first sudo serious fighting game, subject 13 was my guy
[1:19:53] <+MisterRaffles> I don't think I can handle Reggie's Parker
[1:20:17] <$infinite_rotation> I haven’t played in so many years though, you guys would destroy me.
[1:20:22] <+wicketpelican> Did Woolie talk about Sony and CP2077?
[1:20:28] <+Mocking_Jason> well... looks like my ping against people currently playing is like 180+
[1:20:31] <$infinite_rotation> Not to mention I was never good to begin with
[1:20:35] <+lazuli_alter> this is a pocket rumble stream
[1:20:35] <+itrobthebot> Woolie Cyberpunk has been removed from the PlayStation Store wow
[1:20:41] <%RyuuAoi> @wicketpelican Yes
[1:20:44] <MafiaTweek> you played anymore fantasy strike? it's my favorite casual fighter

[1:21:08] <+wicketpelican> @RyuuAoi thanks, I lost it :(

[1:21:14] <%BackwardCap> This game doesn't have a lobby system unfortunately.
[1:21:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo woolie nice beanie
[1:21:19] <$infinite_rotation> Sepheroth challenge my man
[1:21:21] <SableS139a> You can unlock him early in a super hard boss fight.
[1:21:23] <+teriyaki_drinker> Theres a easy mode
[1:21:23] <%BackwardCap> Just ranked matchmaking and invite
[1:21:24] <Nino_Yoojin> it's not actually hard, you can unlock him beating him on normal mode, takes like 1 min
[1:21:26] <Meltgar> Didn't people already beated VERY HARD Sephiroth in like 5-3 seconds? LUL
[1:21:27] <$infinite_rotation> Im doing that once I get home
[1:21:31] <%Ecchigun> GIVE US GENO
[1:21:31] <majinken> @woolieversus you can unlock him on easy
[1:21:32] <%ggbhtg> there's a Very Hard difficulty, but there's tiers below it
[1:21:33] <%Ecchigun> PLEASE
[1:21:37] <SableS139a> All things considered, it's actually a fucking cool idea.
[1:21:42] <%RyTYoung> you can gimp him with Ike really easily, I did it in 19 seconds LUL

[1:22:11] <%LastHazzerd> @Ecchigun didn't see the presentation?
[1:22:11] <+spardanwarrior> Very Hard is pretty tough, but you can unlock him by beating him on normal which is a complete joke.
[1:22:13] <%Exiliator> Geno you say? Kappa
[1:22:14] <TheactualDiepod> its not Megatron
[1:22:16] <destinyspider> Who would you rather have in Smash? Dante or Nero?

[1:22:44] <$infinite_rotation> I dont dislike nero I just would prefer dante
[1:23:15] <%ggbhtg> Go to helllllll
[1:23:20] <destinyspider> I would prefer Dante personally, but I feel like he would be tough to implement because he can do so much stuff
[1:23:21] <%Ecchigun> @WoolieVersus you should probably start doing a "stream steam account"
[1:23:22] <%ggbhtg> Yeye Vergirl
[1:23:28] <destinyspider> Nero might fit better into smash
[1:23:38] <%Ecchigun> aw ok
[1:23:40] <$infinite_rotation> Vergil is great, just finished son of sparda
[1:23:54] <%ggbhtg> Takes too much time
[1:23:56] <%ggbhtg> for a stream
[1:24:08] <%Ecchigun> its a ghost town out there
[1:24:09] <Sadnehs> I couldn't get into Pocket Rumble, the controls are hard and I get destroyed by the CPU (I dont play many fighting games)

[1:27:06] <minasheep> GG Woolie!
[1:27:14] <Kyanta_Rojo> Thing is The can is a Disjoint and can move even when I block.
[1:27:17] <%xeromage> nice work mina
[1:27:25] <%ggbhtg> it her
[1:27:25] <Kyanta_Rojo> you can hit the cat but if you do Keiko might jump in on you
[1:27:28] <+Fuji808> I'm of the opinion that Keiko is the secret top tier.
[1:27:42] <not_kingkai> I'm so glad people are actually playing this
[1:27:44] <Kyanta_Rojo> This MU is kinda hell for Keiko unless they can get the cat behind tenchi
[1:27:44] <%RyuuAoi> SHE ALIVE
[1:27:46] <+Arkbat11> Really wish this game picked up after launch. It's so cool!
[1:27:52] <FacetiousAF> mina like "heard you didn't understand my main, let me shame you"
[1:28:04] <YakumoYomi> WoolieVS continuing the proud tradition of waking dead fighting games and summoning the sleeping gods
[1:28:15] <Kyanta_Rojo> Cat has to be behind Keiko blocking for her or behind the Tenchi
[1:28:21] <FacetiousAF> also keiko is an adorable design
[1:28:42] <%RyuuAoi> The cat, Woolie!
[1:28:42] <$infinite_rotation> Keiko is great but holy shit is she scary in the right hands
[1:28:49] <Kyanta_Rojo> Yeah she's adorable

[1:29:41] <+TheTimelordPan> I love this Cat-thulhu
[1:29:53] <Kyanta_Rojo> That cat is a finger of an cosmic horror loosly tied to this relm
[1:29:57] <Kyanta_Rojo> I love the last round music
[1:30:00] <$infinite_rotation> Pretty sure its not a cat to begin with
[1:30:05] <FacetiousAF> no rojo its just a normal cat Kappa
[1:30:07] <%xeromage> Reggie never seen Madoka Magica
[1:30:08] <+lumporr> yo whoever i just beat, sorry i stole that that was so nasty
[1:30:17] <+TheTimelordPan> our feeble minds can only perceive it as a cat
[1:30:17] <%YeetBoss> Cat tech
[1:30:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> so she's just got Nyantothelp on a leash?
[1:30:20] <minasheep> Ggs ! that was fujn

[1:40:35] <Kyanta_Rojo> I haven't touched the game in years but I took a look just now
[1:40:39] <@akuda_bar> something about that question always feels like a seance, like "am i speaking to the ghost of a community?"
[1:40:40] <+JustToWatch> Fazuli Alter is the evil Italian twin of @lazuli_alter
[1:40:42] <%PlateProp> I would be down to play but I’m stuck at work for another 20ish maybe

[1:42:24] <%ggbhtg> Dang, Karin with projectiles? I should be playing him, my attention is hella split tonight
[1:42:45] <+Fuji808> Parker is my main.
[1:42:49] <%BackwardCap> That would make the parker mirror unplayable
[1:42:52] <+Fuji808> And Parker is AMAZING.
[1:42:52] <+TheTimelordPan> I feel like I walked into a David Lynch fighting game
[1:42:53] <%RyuuAoi> Live by the herb, die by the....
[1:42:58] <Kyanta_Rojo> Yeah he's a very big brain character
[1:43:06] <Kyanta_Rojo> also orbs enable some sick combos and oki
[1:43:08] <%BackwardCap> You'd just be playing ping pong if you could slap each others orbs.
[1:43:13] <+parzano> so whats this game?
[1:43:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> you need a certain level of intelligence to really play Parker
[1:43:24] <+Fuji808> Parker is big brain. Keiko is galaxy brain.

[2:08:10] <+lumporr> hector's anti air is so huge
[2:08:12] <%LastHazzerd> that was awesome
[2:08:17] <%ggbhtg> good hustle y'all
[2:08:18] <FacetiousAF> that was crazy hype
[2:08:20] <%Ecchigun> quinn was the answer
[2:08:23] <%BackwardCap> There is a reason Hector drains health on every move.
[2:08:24] <%ggbhtg> good hustle everyone
[2:08:25] <+lazuli_alter> my man had to turn the cap forward
[2:08:37] <@Menitta> I am late but I am here
[2:09:18] <@Menitta> The Pocket Rumble Fish
[2:09:18] <%PlateProp> @woolieversus 5H>3H>1H
[2:09:24] <%BackwardCap> B forward special to downback special to neutral a in corner
[2:09:32] <ThisGuy198> i was in the discord when the quinn install dropped, SonicFox came in, said " i want to fuck quinn now" never saw him again LUL
[2:09:40] <%PlateProp> 5B>3B>1B
[2:09:41] <+lazuli_alter> LOL
[2:09:56] <%PlateProp> Hold the special input until you see it come out then hold the next one
[2:09:57] <+TopTieramisu> hector uses the chikage?
[2:09:59] <%PlateProp> You can buffer it all
[2:09:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> @thisguy198 based woolieF
[2:10:01] <+xiccy> @ThisGuy198 Of course they did.
[2:10:29] <%BackwardCap> Its tight
[2:10:49] <%PlateProp> You can buffer the 1H while he’s moving forward in 3H @woolieversus
[2:10:49] <%BackwardCap> move details
[2:10:51] <+lazuli_alter> is the kick a link?
[2:11:10] <destinyspider> Is this like Darkstalkers gatlings?
[2:11:15] <%PlateProp> This game has an infinite buffer @woolieversus
[2:11:17] <%BackwardCap> Combos from Jump B too
[2:11:43] <+lazuli_alter> you can also turn on input display by toggling "Move Detail" in the training options
[2:11:44] <+Lord0Mugen> ah shit! Pocket Rumble!
[2:11:45] <%PlateProp> @lazuli_alter technically yes but you can buffer it
[2:11:46] <%RyuuAoi> Well now we gotta do 2 more!
[2:12:00] <+lumporr> maybe if you don't kick at the end you could heal while they knockdown
[2:12:06] <%BackwardCap> Crouching A links to forward A special
[2:12:08] <FacetiousAF> does woolie need the invite to that discord again? Kappa
[2:12:08] <+Lord0Mugen> Hector is pretty fun!
[2:12:17] <Kyanta_Rojo> You can tick throw after
[2:12:23] <%PlateProp> If you heal after 1H you’re like -2 at worst, usually 0
[2:12:27] <Kyanta_Rojo> or even overhead with 1A
[2:12:36] <+Lord0Mugen> June and the Grappler character are my fav!
[2:13:00] <%PlateProp> @woolieversus do 5H>3H>2H>LH
[2:13:03] <+Fuji808> Parker is my main but Subject 11 is my favorite.
[2:13:09] <+Lord0Mugen> So when are the sewer dwellers popping up to own these guys?
[2:13:17] <+lumporr> they already did
[2:13:19] <ThisGuy198> maaan i LATERALLY uninstalled this game this afternoon think I haven't played in years and did i even have it installed for, FML
[2:13:22] <FacetiousAF> mugen you may have missed that part
[2:13:30] <+lazuli_alter> we came out the drain and went back in
[2:13:30] <+Lord0Mugen> @Fuji808 yeah Subject 11 is the shit
[2:13:42] <FacetiousAF> good times were had
[2:14:04] <%LastHazzerd> oh we labbin' now? nice
[2:14:04] <+Lord0Mugen> was everyone the Fatal Fury girl?
[2:14:10] <%Ecchigun> the dual options
[2:14:25] <+Lord0Mugen> Im sure someone was the werewolf
[2:14:32] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[2:14:32] <%Ecchigun> LOL
[2:14:36] <FacetiousAF> the werewolf absolutely got play
[2:14:38] <+Fuji808> Like Grave from Fantasy Strike.
[2:14:41] <SableS139a> k e k
[2:14:42] <%Ecchigun> i dunno LOL
[2:14:46] <+lazuli_alter> kusoru type shit
[2:14:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> @lord0mugen the dwellers are already here
[2:14:52] <%ggbhtg> That's the Marvel blood speaking up
[2:14:52] <+Fuji808> Grave hits a different button for same side or different side crossups.
[2:14:55] <Kyanta_Rojo> combo of a J. A is J.A, 5A, 5A, 3A
[2:15:13] <nathorz1> pocketo rumburu
[2:15:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:27] <gillyboat4> if you forward throw and forward dash JA it crosses up
[2:15:39] <Kyanta_Rojo> or J.A, 5A,5A, 1B
[2:15:40] <%PlateProp> @woolieversus there are three different lengths on wall jump
[2:15:42] <ThisGuy198> played dj in 4 can confirm, knee in front or j.mk crossup
[2:15:48] <willmari02> where can I get this game? looks dope
[2:15:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> steam and switch
[2:15:59] <Kyanta_Rojo> You can do wall jumps with quinn too
[2:16:03] <%PlateProp> Attack goes mid, hold out gives farthest, down drops right next to it
[2:16:09] <+Lord0Mugen> @willmari02 Switch and Steam. but i imagine Steam has the more active community
[2:16:14] <%PlateProp> You have to actually be in the corner to cling to it
[2:16:17] <ThisGuy198> you could cross up with knee but that was hard to set up
[2:16:21] <gillyboat4> most active players have both
[2:16:21] <Kyanta_Rojo> yeah Quinn has to footsies into his triangle jumps
[2:16:34] <Kyanta_Rojo> once he's in he has some strong buttons though
[2:16:40] <%LastHazzerd> he can stick there, juuuuuuust like Vega, riiiiiight?
[2:16:53] <%PlateProp> Yeah you can hang for 40-60f
[2:16:58] <destinyspider> Like Chipp
[2:17:03] <+Lord0Mugen> he plays more likeTalbain tbh
[2:17:11] <%PlateProp> Quinn would be even more hell if he could wall jump always
[2:17:11] <Mangahero18> were revisiting pocket rumble huh?
[2:17:24] <%BackwardCap> Most characters have command based wall clings that don't need the stage edge.
[2:17:34] <gillyboat4> you drop off 41st frame
[2:18:24] <gillyboat4> if you stay on the wall
[2:18:51] <fangovafang> Wolf form??
[2:19:27] <%PlateProp> Wolf locks the camera
[2:19:28] <destinyspider> Ohh. That's sick
[2:19:29] <gillyboat4> you can cancel low heavy into jump normals
[2:19:34] <%BackwardCap> He can't block in Wolf Form though.
[2:19:42] <MaxXtreme23> man he's literally a darkstalkers character with how that install looks
[2:19:50] <%alexisofthestars> Good games my dudes
[2:19:53] <majinken> @woolieversus Quinn is so good just tap b lol
[2:19:58] <%PlateProp> Finally made it to the pc
[2:20:13] <gillyboat4> official mods soon:tm:
[2:20:17] <%BestTeaMaker> wasn't this game supposed to hae dlc?
[2:20:26] <FacetiousAF> yes tea
[2:20:31] <Kyanta_Rojo> At least I got some matches against some of the other viewers.
[2:20:40] <%PlateProp> Morganna is currently implemented but has no sprites
[2:20:40] <FacetiousAF> yo pocket rumble was hype as fuck
[2:20:43] <Kyanta_Rojo> One of these days I'll catch woolie in a vs.

[2:22:36] <%ggbhtg> I gotchu a bit, but ALSO there's an SRK
[2:22:42] <+Lord0Mugen> I never liked the Clan systems and limited to only clan weapons
[2:22:49] <+Carquar> That sound tho
[2:22:53] <%Ecchigun> WAIT BUSHIDO BLADE ?
[2:22:56] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THAT NOISE
[2:22:56] <%Ecchigun> yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[2:22:58] <%TubeMan642> I hear PS2
[2:23:00] <%ggbhtg> 2ndo
[2:23:00] <@Menitta> bwoooooow
[2:23:00] <fangovafang> ❤️
[2:23:01] <+lumporr> even better: bushido blade 2
[2:23:01] <majinken> memories
[2:23:06] <@Menitta> YEAH
[2:23:07] <SableS139a> IT'S TIME
[2:23:10] <%ChoculaUltra> that sound still makes my heart doki doki
[2:23:11] <islandoasis> bushido blade? bring back dokapon instead
[2:23:23] <+JustToWatch> it not Ehrgiez but it's pretty good I guess
[2:23:25] <brunoberserk> TIME FOR BUSHIDO
[2:23:25] <%TubeMan642> I mean PS1
[2:23:41] <+Lord0Mugen> Bushido Blade 1 let you experiment more.
[2:23:53] <%ggbhtg> I never had BB1, so I can't vouch to why it's supposedly better
[2:23:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> its no Tobal no. 1 but sure
[2:24:02] <%ggbhtg> 2 was the childhood
[2:24:12] <+Lord0Mugen> @ggbhtg you arent locked into certain weapons and styles.
[2:24:14] <+lumporr> bushido blade 2 is better because it has the afro man
[2:24:19] <+lumporr> that is all
[2:24:26] <huskarl_zap> worse control
[2:24:27] <brunoberserk> Bushido Blade : the closest thing to a ninja scrool fighting game ... besides samsho
[2:24:36] <%jiggy_snipe> man remember when the big companies had multiple ips that they used
[2:24:47] <%RyuuAoi> Graphic af
[2:24:50] <huskarl_zap> I dislike the simplification of the controls
[2:24:57] <%Exiliator> LUL
[2:25:09] <SableS139a> Yeah, Square was the only major player at the time to have really good CG besides Sega.
[2:25:14] <+Lord0Mugen> @huskarl_zap Bushido Blade 2 is definitely more "casual"
[2:25:15] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[2:25:16] <majinken> This needs to come back
[2:25:23] <%RyuuAoi> Gimme Tekken 8 like dis!
[2:25:27] <$Invlux> If someone did a game that in engine looked exactly like this, I'd buy it
[2:25:27] <SableS139a> Also SourPls
[2:25:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> I mean there CGI scenes now still look super good
[2:25:29] <%ggbhtg> and then the devs made Kengo.....
[2:25:31] <fangovafang> it just hits different
[2:25:32] <%ggbhtg> anyway
[2:25:32] <MaxXtreme23> all we're missing is Edge of Soul playing in the background
[2:25:43] <islandoasis> square bet so deep on their cg tech, they made spirits within
[2:25:44] <brunoberserk> bushido blade 2 : bushido harder
[2:25:44] <%ChoculaUltra> I hope Woolie has a save file with all the characters unlocked cuz unlocking everyone is a friggin pain in the ass
[2:25:52] <townzzzzz> better not pick that gun
[2:25:54] <%ggbhtg> There's a Bloody Palace Kappa
[2:25:56] <+lumporr> dude the hypest moment of my fighting game life was staying up all night trying to beat the game with the right characters, when a fucking ninja whipped out a GUN and SHOT ME
[2:25:57] <majinken> need some cocoa butter on that shit lol
[2:25:58] <+Lord0Mugen> @ggbhtg Didnt they also do Kabuki Warriors?
[2:26:04] <%ChoculaUltra> pleaseeee pick the Gun characters LUL
[2:26:16] <huskarl_zap> I want broken screen space reflections
[2:26:27] <+Lord0Mugen> @ggbhtg They DID!!!
[2:26:31] <%LastHazzerd> OH RIGHT
[2:26:32] <%ggbhtg> Tekken 2 has this mode via a Cheat Code, Reg! @WoolieVersus
[2:26:33] <%jiggy_snipe> well they tried
[2:26:36] <%LastHazzerd> It's goddamn first person
[2:26:41] <+lumporr> i was like "BUT THEY'RE NINJAS" and my brother was like "EXACTLY"
[2:26:44] <%RyuuAoi> In VR doe...
[2:26:52] <SableS139a> Virtual-On's pretty decent when a 1st-Person mode is offered. Which I think was only the PS2 version of Operation Moon Gate.
[2:26:53] <huskarl_zap> POV mode PogChamp
[2:26:53] <majinken> imagine online with 1st person
[2:26:55] <%ggbhtg> IPPON
[2:26:55] <+Lord0Mugen> it also has System link exactly for this reason
[2:26:56] <islandoasis> frigging wireframes
[2:27:11] <huskarl_zap> Fight night had first person
[2:27:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> looking like arcade punch out
[2:27:16] <+Reiveth> the one in bushido blade 1 is way worse
[2:27:25] <%ggbhtg> You can ALSO Link Cable 2 PS1s and do this mode Reg!
[2:27:27] <GeltonZ> Dude, Bushido Blade 1 has system link support just for 2-player POV mode!
[2:27:34] <%ggbhtg> Because people totally had the link cables!
[2:27:35] <brunoberserk> give me a bushido blade VR ,just for the LOLS
[2:27:36] <%RyuuAoi> Intense ngl
[2:27:37] <+lazuli_alter> YALL SAW NOTHING

[2:46:35] <s1rcuit> @jiggy_snipe the art of parking lot construction was lost in the 1600's

[2:46:37] <Hammatime8> Deadliest Warrior!

[2:47:02] <%Ecchigun> ooof
[2:47:06] <%Ecchigun> the double tap
[2:47:17] <islandoasis> something tells me that this game isnt balanced well
[2:47:18] <+lumporr> which characters could pull out the double swords also
[2:47:26] <Brandon__Brando> that show was so stupid it was great
[2:47:34] <s1rcuit> a lot of Deadliest Warrior's matchups were garbage in the show
[2:47:43] <Mangahero18> That reach is too good.
[2:47:46] <SheefEatsBeef> ALMOST REGGIE
[2:47:48] <+ItsRatman> imagine going to your car and seeing this play out WWYD?
[2:47:49] <%BackwardCap> Gotta use speed to beat the range advantage.
[2:47:53] <Meltgar> Rajput Warrior had the DEADLIEST fatality in that game
[2:48:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Deadliest Warrior had me going "oh snap, Aztec Warrior vs Ninja?! I'M IN" with the wacky match-ups

[2:53:23] <islandoasis> froge
[2:53:27] <Mangahero18> Tony...is probably a little culturally insensitive/racist for this day and age so I doubt he would make it into any modern day Bushido Blade sequel without some serious character changes.
[2:53:32] <%ggbhtg> it can stun lock @WoolieVersus

[3:00:03] <Meltgar> WOW
[3:00:11] <MaxXtreme23> this game embodies the spirit of two kids in the backyard with pool noodles trying to whack each other
[3:00:24] <+darrylwestly> In order to parry attacks you press opposite button of the attacking character on contact
[3:00:32] <%ggbhtg> This HAS to be a 100% save, so....
[3:00:34] <destinyspider> I am thinking of doing that with an action game guy, but it would be too tough to implement.

[3:38:29] <+vaporousTippler> Claymore ain't no joke.
[3:38:29] <Meltgar> Reach vs Speed?
[3:38:30] <destinyspider> How does parsec work again? You don't need the game, you just join in and play?
[3:38:42] <nakunattakage> it just reads your controller input
[3:38:43] <Applecannon63> Katana is overrated
[3:38:45] <%ggbhtg> it's just a remote desktop client
[3:38:49] <%ggbhtg> a very good one tho
[3:38:58] <snow_soldier> Spears are the meta
[3:39:03] <snow_soldier> But sword are cool though
[3:39:05] <+SixMachine> most samurai were actually bow and spearmen
[3:39:10] <Hundkain> this series needs to come back NotLikeThis
[3:39:11] <islandoasis> swords were more of a status symbol
[3:39:14] <destinyspider> Interesting. Might have to try get in on that sometime.
[3:39:22] <Meltgar> Spear is easier to learn, spear peasants could beat sword peasants
[3:39:26] <%ggbhtg> His gravestone will look cool too Kappa
[3:39:34] <Cyphereous> The French ruin everything again.
[3:39:35] <Applecannon63> I prefer Nagamaki which is just a better Katana with a longer handle like a spear
[3:39:40] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Spear peasants beat everything
[3:39:47] <destinyspider> For now tho I'm on my phone, so no honourable samurai fights for me
[3:39:50] <islandoasis> cheaper to mass produce too, spears required alot less metal than swords
[3:39:51] <Hammatime8> Y'all ever play Mordhau? That game really brings out the strength of spears.

[4:00:06] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 10 minutes
[4:00:10] <%ggbhtg> @vaporousTippler nope, you play Plasma Sword
[4:00:11] <%mr_miyagucci> forgot about nidhogg
[4:00:30] <roguemephilesclone> Hyperfight is also in this pool, and it's free on Steam.
[4:00:37] <+vaporousTippler> Plasma Sword isn't a thing. It doesn't exist. It has no gods to which to pray.
[4:00:41] <T_Sasquatch> did anyone clip when woolie found out about cyberpunk ?
[4:00:54] <chroma3> the dark souls of fighting games? Kappa
[4:00:58] <%ggbhtg> @vaporousTippler But it was SUPPOSED to be a Star Wars fighter
[4:01:07] <%mr_miyagucci> forgot about hyperfight as well. not personally a fan of it but it definitely falls in that category
[4:01:19] <+vaporousTippler> And Lucifer was SUPPOSED to be an angel.
[4:01:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie ain't care about cyberpunk he just told us to quit it LUL
[4:01:38] <anarchistPastry> have we played nidhogg here yet?
[4:01:55] <%ggbhtg> only when 2 warriors of equal strength clash.....
[4:02:01] <%ggbhtg> can the truth be revealed
[4:02:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:02:10] <+psydaku> psydaku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! how do you get jackpot in dmc 5 with vergil?
[4:02:15] <roguemephilesclone> Hyperfight is a fair bit like Pocket Rumble. Doesn't look as good, but like I said, it's free and it matches the "learn the game in 20 minutes" category.
[4:03:36] <roguemephilesclone> @psydaku Do three Judgement Cuts in a row. Very precise.
[4:03:41] <%mr_miyagucci> nice thing is that most of those kinds of games aren't too expensive
[4:04:16] <roguemephilesclone> Hifight's videos are friggin' incredible and everyone should watch them.
[4:04:29] <%ggbhtg> Tekken is only truly fun when you're not getting gimmicks thrown at you all day
[4:04:47] <%ggbhtg> when I can actually intentionally let combos drop for positioning
[4:04:55] <%ggbhtg> that's good ass Tekken
[4:05:35] <%ggbhtg> When I play against a matchup I know in and out, and THEY KNOW TOO.....
[4:05:41] <roguemephilesclone> Isn't Tekken made to minimize gimmicks? I mean, my mains are dumb gimmicky, but I'm drawn to the hyper weirdos. Most of the cast just has what they have.
[4:05:50] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Tweeted you a little diagram
