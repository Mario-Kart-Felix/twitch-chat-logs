[1:05:48] <+cubbywolf> ... I just find it funny... RUN
[1:05:48] <%topendbuzza> what does vacuum do?

[1:05:56] <gunstars20> Minh shall beef his way to victory LUL
[1:05:56] <NoviceArtist4090> Vacuum
[1:05:57] <kikoeru_san> Mihn looks super punchable right now

[1:06:12] <Shmario> this is kind of normal on a rpg classes like mage and thief gang up a paladin,since he's so resistant and both cant kill a paladin alone
[1:06:13] <+undersea_magic> lame it out
[1:06:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie and Woolie need to cooperate in order to kill him
[1:06:16] <dds333a> I'M FUCKING INVINCIBLE
[1:06:20] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh's build was messed for awhile and now he made the most tanky thing LUL
[1:06:21] <OldManDeckardCain> minh just literally can pick counter every time nd then blessing to stall this forever LUL
