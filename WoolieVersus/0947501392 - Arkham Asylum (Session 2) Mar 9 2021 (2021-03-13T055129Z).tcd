[0:02:55] <@akuda_bar> That Man
[0:02:56] <SheefEatsBeef> THAT MAN
[0:02:57] <%ChoculaUltra> did you guys see the "drama" between the mainstream fgc and the KOF community on twitter these past few days? Hilarious.

[0:03:15] <mastertaffer83> How far are you gonna get into Yakuza 7? I hope not too far, 10 hours of just main story is definately a cap, however side content is of course an "X hours" option.
[0:03:20] <khalcatto> VaatiVidya of Gulty Gear
[0:03:20] <%Jiggisnipe> like you did with Pat Kappa
[0:03:21] <Darren716> Like the guy from the first video?
[0:03:22] <+FuqBoiSlim> AMONG...US???
[0:03:24] <%phd_in_thuggery> THAT LORE
[0:03:24] <%Valask> y'all still speaking English?
[0:03:26] <Asuterisuku> After that last lore video would -SIGN- be a good place to pick up?
[0:03:29] <Prevot> as someone who never played GG, I'm watching those videos and understanding absolutely nothing
[0:03:29] <leith_aziz> Is he called "That man" because its a "He who shall not be named" thing ?
[0:03:30] <@Solidus_113> That guy that we banned from fact checking after episode 1
[0:03:31] <prime_name> It's like being that "debate me" guy on Twitter
[0:03:31] <BourneWarrior> Nintendo hire "That Man"
[0:03:32] <%SentaiGarm> amogus?

[0:03:51] <leith_aziz> Ahhh
[0:03:51] <%BusterRepukken> @ChoculaUltra it was over nothing. KOF people are just tired of 'OMG KOF 13 SO HARD' discourse and it snowballed into this.
[0:03:52] <MBDiana1> it must feel good that after Overture, researching GG Lore is much easier

[0:04:23] <%ChoculaUltra> @BusterRepukken LUL I know, its just so bonkers to see that these are grown ass men arguing about whether or not their game is too hard or not

[0:04:30] <%kullumanati> With great Woolie comes great Wooliecast.
[0:04:35] <%Valask> BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME IP BabyRage
[0:04:36] <DatAsuna> "x is the pokemon game everyone wants" is usually a big oversimplification of x
[0:04:37] <prime_name> Pokemon has too much of a vice grip on the Monster Raising genre
[0:04:39] <%LastHazzerd> NOPE, my god we got some winners today
[0:04:40] <%Mattais88> Rathalos is a lot cooler than 80% of pokemon designs
[0:04:42] <%X2Eliah> Monster Hunter is just Monster Hunter, it's basically like getting excidet about yet another Pokemon game
[0:04:43] <CaptainBright> Juan Gai, secret cousin of Guy-sensei, wielder of the secret Tenth Gate
[0:04:44] <VidulaSaix> To be fair, Pat is also Pat
[0:04:47] <enerkaizer> Hunter stories was dissapointing because he literally get all the actuzall story parts already in the demo. the actuall game jhas as much story as the original pokemon red/blue
[0:04:48] <%megaman_sentinel> I have been the woolieONEGUY before

[0:08:45] <leith_aziz> Im getting frutrated with this crap
[0:08:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Imagine if games and recording cards let you split game music and sfx audio tracks
[0:08:46] <%kewlmyc> You aren't missing much, the music is whatever
[0:08:50] <Hawkbone_> That super sucks because the whole Arkham series has absolute KILLER soundtracks
[0:08:50] <%wibbwobbler> making as hard as possible is prob on purpose
[0:08:53] <%ChoculaUltra> Get 2 Mello to score your LP!
[0:08:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Honestly it's not even worth watching the YouTube episodes cuz you're not getting the real deal. Just watch Twitch VODs
[0:08:56] <leith_aziz> THE WHOLE SOUNDTRACK ?
[0:08:56] <CaptainBright> @phd_in_thuggery I go back to that playlist once in awhile to gain some SAN back

[0:09:19] <%saladin1911> Just play Bullshit Blazing LUL
[0:09:19] <peachy996> The soundtrack to batman?
[0:09:20] <Pnutz409> man that sucks. I'm sorry man.
[0:09:20] <%bearwagon> just pretend Michael Keaton is screaming into your ears
[0:09:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude, there's no DMCA music in Arkham Asylum, what the fuck are you talking about?
[0:09:20] <leith_aziz> Is ANY Arkham music bad ?
[0:09:21] <+EdenOfLove> so you're not gonya splice in free music instead?
[0:09:22] <%X2Eliah> Play royalty-free anime buttrocks
[0:09:24] <+HeroSolaire> Wait what?
[0:09:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I'll play 60's batman music in another tab
[0:09:25] <+applemon198> wait arkham asylum has copyrighted music?
[0:09:25] <CureMode_> might as well play it off in your offtime
[0:09:26] <%X2Eliah> butt-rock*
[0:09:26] <MyNameIsRasus> just play the TAS opening on loop
[0:09:27] <TheAceol> Imagine if voice acting gets like this in the future
[0:09:29] <slix3431> Play K-pop
[0:09:29] <leith_aziz> Can you use Arkham City OST ?
[0:09:29] <Lancaster_H> that gonna fuck up some great moments
[0:09:31] <user_naim> Well, I‚Äôm probably out of this LP
[0:09:31] <moonmintparadise> wait what how is this music copyrighted ???
[0:09:32] <BigBlackBankai> F
[0:09:36] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> How dare you depict WB's content in the public sphere!
[0:09:38] <leith_aziz> No
[0:09:39] <TheWizardOfWordplay> just loudly scream the burton theme
[0:09:39] <TallPixels> can reggie play the organ in real time
[0:09:40] <enerkaizer> Can't you, in theory, take the audio from a gameplay only video to atleast get the audio clips?
[0:09:40] <CrematedCube> It's a reasonable sacrifice
[0:09:41] <Clundy> Time for royalty free spooky bgm
[0:09:42] <leith_aziz> Dont do that
[0:09:45] <+DizzyGunner> fuck the people on youtube Kappa
[0:09:47] <DatAsuna> @keiganofastora tell that to WB
[0:09:48] <%emperordread> Manga reader master race
[0:09:48] <%LastHazzerd> YouTube is more important
[0:09:49] <%X2Eliah> Nooo losing the voice acting is worst
[0:09:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's the DMCA stuff in Arkham Asylum? I'm pretty sure there isn't unless you consider the soundtrack copyrighted?
[0:09:56] <%krispen_wa> Play Bury the Light on repeat
[0:09:58] <BlackermanZX> do ya have some dmca free music
[0:09:59] <CaptainBright> wait a second, Arkham Asylum has copyrighted OSTs?!
[0:09:59] <Equirah> we're fine without music
[0:10:01] <%Jiggisnipe> all video game music can and is copyrighted. Most game companies don't file claims tho
[0:10:02] <NeoseekerStitch> Sometimes even background music gets claimed
[0:10:02] <Darren716> I'm shocked this isn't a known issue about this game
[0:10:05] <+HeroSolaire> Woolie you need to experience the original game with music tho
[0:10:05] <Asuterisuku> No music is the lesser of evils.
[0:10:05] <leith_aziz> Would it work if you used Arkham City OST or is it ALL OST ?
[0:10:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is it just cuz the OST is copyrighted?
[0:10:07] <%phd_in_thuggery> the anime has to have changes made for the product to stand
[0:10:07] <NeoseekerStitch> Happened with Kingdom Hearts 3
[0:10:11] <arkv01> ehhh fuck their music
[0:10:11] <peachy996> How?
[0:10:12] <marvel877> the music's copyrighted?
[0:10:12] <Pnutz409> play some little v in the background.
[0:10:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Play the metallica dmca free music
[0:10:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> WOW
[0:10:13] <+popo0129> Wooow I love how they make life harder for content creators like they aren't the ones who help bring in people to the website
[0:10:14] <Ghostbody> It's the soundtrack. Injustice does the same thing
[0:10:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> THAT'S FUCKED UP
[0:10:15] <Clundy> @keiganofastora that‚Äôs legit it
[0:10:17] <marvel877> since when?
[0:10:17] <+nabs2099> FUCK WB
[0:10:18] <@Solidus_113> WB does it with almost all their games
[0:10:18] <Mangahero18> Just dont play the game anymore. Its not even WORTH it without the soundtrack.
[0:10:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's sof ucking dumb
[0:10:26] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Big Batman music is (c)(tm)(r) et al
[0:10:27] <prime_name> Do people want their games to be played?
[0:10:28] <arkv01> whatever fuck your DMCA batman
[0:10:29] <moonmintparadise> dont even bother anymore, woolie
[0:10:30] <heart_ablaze> this fucking sucks
[0:10:30] <leith_aziz> ALL Arkham OST ?
[0:10:31] <picanoturna> that is duuuumb
[0:10:34] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, its why you don't see any recent Batman LPs.
[0:10:36] <%krispen_wa> JUST MOVE TO BERMUDA
[0:10:36] <TomosukeUsagi> Oh I just finished the arkham games last week PrideUwu
[0:10:36] <MyNameIsRasus> fucking albania
[0:10:37] <Darren716> Which ones?
[0:10:38] <%chosenjuan42> Warn A Brothers!
[0:10:40] <leith_aziz> Maybe it works with City OST ?
[0:10:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:10:41] <Asuterisuku> Turns out Canada is one of those?
[0:10:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> They just don't want you to play it for other people. They think if someone wants to see it played they should buy it themselves
[0:10:44] <enerkaizer> Remember: Arkham asylum was made BEFORE devs realized Lets plays were a thing and before the entire copyright crusade
[0:10:45] <TheAceol> @Mangahero18 It's a good game even without it, bit drastic
[0:10:45] <moonmintparadise> you should play games that just dont do that and dont risk it
[0:10:47] <heart_ablaze> and the music in this game is fantastic too...
[0:10:55] <BigBlackBankai> anime watchers like reading subs tho
[0:10:57] <%Dante_Namikaze1> if you are getting copyright struck with some of the music if you do continue playing these games make sure you mute the main menu for Arkham City
[0:10:58] <Clundy> Batman wouldn‚Äôt want people playing his games to get dmca‚Äôd
[0:10:59] <+HeroSolaire> Just upload the video on vimeo or pornhub idk, don't mute the music lmao
[0:11:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Play the music for us on Twitch, otherwise this is gonna be a chore to sit through
[0:11:05] <TallPixels> is there a specific track that's being stuck?
[0:11:05] <marvel877> LP ruined, I guess.
[0:11:11] <puluxor> That sucks. Oh welp oneeWhat
[0:11:11] <%phd_in_thuggery> "FUCK NEW ZEALAND!" -WB
[0:11:12] <%ChoculaUltra> this is literally just a bunch of old fucks at WB thinking "how can we make more money off this bullshit"
[0:11:12] <NeoseekerStitch> Playing this without music will suck
[0:11:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Fuck this
[0:11:14] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus : Is it for All Arkham OST ? Can you try for example City OST ?
[0:11:17] <+skyheys> WB is awful with media in general
[0:11:19] <+popo0129> Seriously needs to be an exemption for music in games or just using like 10 seconds of a song
[0:11:21] <NeoseekerStitch> it's half the emotion gone
[0:11:27] <%jinking79> that time that one YouTube channel copyright that RE2 Remake cutscene
[0:11:28] <%Jiggisnipe> play some wacky music over the lp Kappa
[0:11:33] <+drk_sd> corporate thuggery
[0:11:37] <marvel877> Playing this withour the music's like playing DMC or THPS without the music.
[0:11:39] <rytisone> experiencing the game for the first time without music is shit
[0:11:39] <Lancaster_H> worsenin the game for yourself vs fucking up the YT uploads is some hard shit
[0:11:42] <@Solidus_113> yeah, the DLC music video LUL
[0:11:42] <Mangahero18> @TheAceol Sure is. And I heartily reccommend everyone including Woolie and Reggie play it on their own time where they can fully enjoy the full soundtrack. The LP however is completely ruined now.
[0:11:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus WB's idea is that if a person wants to see the game played they should buy it themselves. I get the idea but fuck...
[0:11:43] <TheAceol> Just play single notes extended over a few seconds, then jump ahead a few seconds and repeat
[0:11:44] <BlackermanZX> is there anything dmca free you play
[0:11:50] <%bearwagon> Kirby soundtrack over Batman PogChamp
[0:11:58] <%jaggstar2020> Acapella
[0:11:58] <+HeroSolaire> Just
[0:12:00] <+skyheys> Atmospheric gotham noises
[0:12:02] <picanoturna> omikron soundtrack
[0:12:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude just drop the LPs, fuck it
[0:12:04] <MyNameIsRasus> DJ CutMinh
[0:12:04] <PrideOfFiddles> Big ups to Minh
[0:12:07] <Asuterisuku> The DMCA was written and passed in 1996; it's outdated legislation that wasn't prepared for the expansion of the internet.
[0:12:08] <leith_aziz> Dammit.... but its not your fault, Woolie
[0:12:09] <+RiverKing13> Only the main theme will get you claimed
[0:12:09] <+twohitgood> fuck wb
[0:12:10] <arkv01> layer in some RULES OF NAAAAATURE
[0:12:13] <CaptainBright> yeah fuck it; just kill the music and place kirby music in it
[0:12:16] <radar410> Is the soundtrack DMCA for the other Arkham games too? Cause they're not really worth playing if that's the case. The music in Arkham City is too good to miss out on, it enhances the game so much
[0:12:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just play it for yourself not on stream so you can actually play the real game
[0:12:17] <leith_aziz> WTF......
[0:12:18] <BigBlackBankai> Imagine Dark Knight theme in head
[0:12:19] <+popo0129> Do music artists get upset over music used by content creators or is it just the dumb companies that own them
[0:12:20] <MyNameIsRasus> replace the ost with the MGR one
[0:12:20] <+nabs2099> @woolieversus Hate to say it but did you hear about YouTube increasing taxes or something for non US based YouTubers? Why are they like this?
[0:12:22] <%phd_in_thuggery> Shoutouts to studios and composers who actively keep in contact with creators to try and fix this bullshit
[0:12:24] <MyNameIsRasus> it will be improved
[0:12:26] <+skyheys> The music was all ambient anyway tbh
[0:12:26] <%RyTYoung> what about if you have the game music turned down reaaaaally quietly? @woolieversus
[0:12:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's basically like you're not playing it
[0:12:30] <+studiocomfy> have someone play some old timey piano music live
[0:12:31] <rytisone> imagine playing DMC5 without music
[0:12:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ambient music MAKES game like this
[0:12:35] <+panwithaplan29> I'm sorry Woolie
[0:12:36] <glass_marcus> play metroid music
[0:12:38] <TallPixels> how are you gonna tell if you've been spotted
[0:12:40] <%Valask> It fits with your brand Kappa
[0:12:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Can you play with music on Twitch at least?
[0:12:42] <%ChoculaUltra> You, Minh, and Reggie should just dub the voices over for the Anime LUL
[0:12:44] <RedTako> 1960s batman music
[0:12:44] <%krispen_wa> The biggest blackest bankai
[0:12:51] <leith_aziz> Would it work if the music is REALLY low or do you not wanna risk that ?
[0:13:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Not worth the risk
[0:13:03] <leith_aziz> Relatable ?
[0:13:03] <stardustcrusad3r> deku from myhero
[0:13:04] <CaptainBright> author insertion
[0:13:07] <Hawkbone_> Honestly if you can't play the game with music I kinda half feel like the game isn't worth playing at all tbh
[0:13:08] <%phd_in_thuggery> Alway been around
[0:13:10] <Prevot> isn't that just superman also
[0:13:11] <+popo0129> Just hum the music yourself lol
[0:13:12] <picanoturna> kirito
[0:13:21] <+JaseAdrift> never been anything new
[0:13:22] <enerkaizer> I mean all of the 80ies action heroes were like that, too
[0:13:22] <slix3431> Self insertion lol
[0:13:23] <Lancaster_H> i honestly would rather woolie didnt ruin it for himself and edit the YT videos but hey its not my choice, that sucks
[0:13:23] <Goraka91> I know someone who just skips all cutscenes in ever game they play now JUST IN CASE
[0:13:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Old movies had the most boring male leads imaginable

[0:15:01] <+condemned_15> Power Rangers Turbo was shit tho

[0:15:14] <enerkaizer> it works better on older/adult people from what I've seen
[0:15:21] <leith_aziz> We got lucky that Terry was written the way he was
[0:15:24] <+skyheys> I hate it
[0:15:25] <+MightyDuckShoes> and that's why Walking Dead blew up
[0:15:25] <%X2Eliah> Yeah it worked super well in Star Wars. NOW THIS IS POD-RACING!!!
[0:15:26] <%Jiggisnipe> who relates to Kiryu?
[0:15:27] <%LastHazzerd> it's why i want Persona to be college kids now instead of highschool
[0:15:28] <%BusterRepukken> how much does eyepatchwolf hate yakuza 7, does he like anything
[0:15:28] <rytisone> I wonder if that worked for Dragon Ball GTA
[0:15:29] <@Menitta> This is why Yakuza 7 is great. I relate to these unemployed losers
[0:15:35] <+dawsfloss> Woolie would use a time machine to go back & fight his past self LUL

[0:16:27] <leith_aziz> Or a JoJo
[0:16:31] <%phd_in_thuggery> Garzey's Wing is an isekai by Tomino
[0:16:34] <jesdan89> one piece?
[0:16:34] <prime_name> I don't think Non-self insert stories are that rare.
[0:16:35] <+GenesisKnight> @leith_aziz A trapped in another world story
[0:16:36] <BigBlackBankai> I sure do love 29 something brown haired white guy in videogames
[0:16:37] <@Menitta> Konosuba is if Always Sunny was an Isekai

[0:16:52] <%Valask> VAAN
[0:16:53] <+dawsfloss> @ScrumDyna u right
[0:16:53] <%X2Eliah> Self-insert vs. Actual character: Kiryu vs. Ichiban.
[0:16:54] <dmysta3000> I like that there are characters like Shinji that absolutely give the finger to that trope

[0:17:02] <Equirah> Vaan is *not* the main character LUL
[0:17:02] <%LastHazzerd> FF12 NotLikeThis
[0:17:05] <+eanscrale> You can honestly treat him like the camera man.
[0:17:11] <%Valask> god it's so obvious
[0:17:12] <TigerClaws12> you're literally 3rd wheeling the entire game
[0:17:13] <+BananaSlammuh> I think there‚Äôs some definite self insert stories that play with the whole idea of it like ReZero.
[0:17:15] <NoctisxMog> Basch was robbed :(
[0:17:16] <BlackermanZX> Do you know that Digimon is an Isekai StinkyGlitch
[0:17:18] <%LordSDB> I heard FF12 woolieCHAN
[0:17:18] <%Jiggisnipe> cuz Vaan is the camera man
[0:17:21] <Ghostbody> That was the original intention
[0:17:24] <leith_aziz> Tidus was done better IMO
[0:17:24] <Teradyne87> It's like playing a Star Wars game as C-3PO
[0:17:25] <%megaman_sentinel> yea FF12
[0:17:25] <%wibbwobbler> terrible
[0:17:28] <+GenesisKnight> Vaan was the 4th choice for Protag
[0:17:29] <leith_aziz> From FFX
[0:17:30] <+0neReeler> but sales
[0:17:31] <arkv01> someone's gotta film the porn and vaan was the man
[0:17:34] <%chosenjuan42> ah yeah it's annoying the side character becomes the main character

[0:18:57] <BigBlackBankai> kinda sorta dumbells
[0:19:01] <%chosenjuan42> There was a Sumo anime where the main character was a huge asshole

[0:19:09] <+bairros> lowest common denominator
[0:19:09] <jamesthebrave> By the way the difference between rando spunky kid hero and actually really interesting character is the difference between Gundam Build Divers and its direct sequel

[0:19:58] <%krispen_wa> Woolie Versus Tropes is my least favorite discussion
[0:19:59] <mankeymania> kind of
[0:20:00] <michaelpolandwatcher> maaan, new marvel movies arent good either
[0:20:00] <Darren716> Spiderman was the main one because it was 2002

[0:20:07] <%eyezehuhh> Transformers
[0:20:07] <Prevot> woolie needs to go read that Tropes Are Not Bad page on TVTropes
[0:20:08] <enerkaizer> They didn't need a flag, they had literally Captain America LUL
[0:20:08] <%orcstr16> That hits hard in a very specific niche.
[0:20:09] <+admiral_of_crunch> Woolie hates tropes. More at 11
[0:20:10] <%dreadedcthulhu> captain AMERICA
[0:20:10] <+Negus_Rex> Cap is the flag
[0:20:11] <Great_Daze> you mean cliches woolie

[0:20:17] <+skyheys> iron man did it
[0:20:20] <MyNameIsRasus> it is literally impossible to completely original nowadays, originality is how you combine tropes
[0:20:21] <leith_aziz> I mean you have Captain America...
[0:20:21] <TigerClaws12> (((subtlety)))
[0:20:23] <masterfire23> mushoku tensei slaps watch it
[0:20:23] <%megaman_sentinel> Superman the alien supports America
[0:20:24] <+nabs2099> Captain America hates America
[0:20:29] <@Menitta> you hate bad tropes
[0:20:29] <+RiverKing13> It is the post 9/11 move
[0:20:29] <michaelpolandwatcher> @FrostedZaibatsu well yeah, source material truthfullness
[0:20:30] <+admiral_of_crunch> Woolie, tropes are not cliches
[0:20:32] <%phd_in_thuggery> Tropes can ruin or enhance things
[0:20:33] <%Chatterbox1991> he was the coolest guy
[0:20:33] <%krispen_wa> EVERYTHING IS TROPES WOOLIE
[0:20:34] <Hawkbone_> If you hate tropes, you hate all media.
[0:20:35] <+0neReeler> me like flag me clap
[0:20:35] <leith_aziz> Well im pretty young
[0:20:35] <+MightyDuckShoes> Captain America is literally a walking American flag
[0:20:35] <@Solidus_113> yeah, tropes =/= clich√©s
[0:20:37] <+Gloom_Tangerine> Hey wooliie what is that you‚Äôre drinking?
[0:20:37] <+noajenkk> nah tropesa re fine
[0:20:37] <%jinking79> Superman just does Jesus
[0:20:37] <gigamaid> Woolie talk more about Gundam
[0:20:38] <%Valask> oh god
[0:20:38] <Darren716> Woolie literally everything in media is tropes
[0:20:38] <%RyTYoung> CON-sume
[0:20:39] <@Menitta> I like the good tropes
[0:20:40] <leith_aziz> Maybe I cant relate
[0:20:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> Black Panther even got tied to the cross
[0:20:40] <Hawkbone_> LITERALLY EVERYTHING IS TROPES
[0:20:42] <Equirah> MCU absolutely does it and with more than just flags
[0:20:46] <Torgue_1> Writers, don't use writing tools. Use something different!
[0:20:46] <%chosenjuan42> How about Superman but EVIL?
[0:20:46] <%DakotaMacDoodle> This is true
[0:20:48] <%Dante_Namikaze1> I have one more year
[0:20:49] <tinmanscan99> cliches is the correct term
[0:20:51] <DatAsuna> fair distinction yeah
[0:20:51] <arkv01> OKAY OLD MAN LUL
[0:20:53] <Prevot> if you hate tropes you just hate fiction in general
[0:20:53] <+noajenkk> tropes are just writing tools
[0:20:54] <leith_aziz> Like, if its done WELL, then I dont mind
[0:20:56] <%aram909> trope is just a general observation. cliches are the negative connotation
[0:21:01] <%wibbwobbler> i dunno
[0:21:02] <enZymeth> Woolie had a bad experience with a rotten trope salad :(
[0:21:03] <leith_aziz> Ezio from AC is a good example
[0:21:04] <%Wulfphelz> I think you consumed things that let you down but that may be my zoomer mind talking
[0:21:05] <+skyheys> Yeah, trope is literally anything. cliche is overused ones
[0:21:08] <%X2Eliah> Woolie the correct word is "gaskwang"
[0:21:08] <+admiral_of_crunch> Character development!
[0:21:10] <+TheotherKristian> Dear Lord, that Vegan Teacher video gave me the hardest laugh, this month
[0:21:12] <Goraka91> Literally every story is tropes
[0:21:12] <+RiverKing13> Why don't you just move on to different content?
[0:21:13] <Komayeda> Tropes are story elements, cliches are tired and by the numbers story elements.
[0:21:13] <Darren716> There's a reason why they are using them though, they work
[0:21:14] <leith_aziz> AC2 more specificaly
[0:21:15] <Torgue_1> Cliche
[0:21:15] <%chosenjuan42> What I'd Batman but KILL?
[0:21:18] <DatAsuna> cliche works
[0:21:18] <sunnythedrunk> Nice caught the stream live today :)
[0:21:20] <tinmanscan99> Clich√©
[0:21:21] <@Menitta> I bet Woolie would like the 2nd jail in Persona 5 Strikers. All the characters are like "this fuckin predictable cliche bullshit"
[0:21:21] <MinersLoveGames> Cliche.
[0:21:23] <MyNameIsRasus> A clich√© is an overdone trope
[0:21:25] <%cache_22> Misusing "trope" is a cliche. Kappa
[0:21:26] <Mangahero18> CLICHES ARE JUST TROPES THAT HAVE BEEN OVERUSED.
[0:21:26] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Mangahero18
[0:21:27] <brunoberserk> tropes are okay , you only need to use them in the right way
[0:21:27] <prime_name> Cliche is what you're looking for
[0:21:29] <%jinking79> regular guy goes to a Magical World
[0:21:30] <JaseHateRadio> cliche
[0:21:34] <+RiverKing13> Cliche
[0:21:34] <tinmanscan99> cool üòé
[0:21:35] <+0neReeler> then you have the deconstruction
[0:21:37] <+noajenkk> neat
[0:21:46] <MinersLoveGames> Anything can be done well if its done well.
[0:21:49] <Ciriliko> wut
[0:21:49] <+nabs2099> Oh that's cute
[0:21:49] <heart_ablaze> tropes are ok, as long as you don't rely on them..
[0:21:50] <+GenesisKnight> Good for them
[0:21:50] <%LastHazzerd> i guess cliche could be considered a tired trope
[0:21:52] <+FuqBoiSlim> How about instead of killing the Joker, Batman gives him a hug ü§ó
[0:21:52] <Halospaz117> rad
[0:21:54] <+admiral_of_crunch> We're trying to save you from internet ridicule. It's all cool
[0:21:56] <%X2Eliah> The fun thing is, vast majority of tropes are cliches so both temrs work for most cases
[0:21:56] <+skyheys> THEYRE SOMETHING
[0:21:57] <%chosenjuan42> Yeah injustice good
[0:21:57] <picanoturna> thats rad
[0:21:58] <HelluvaNohbody> Nice
[0:21:58] <prime_name> Injustice 2 does not show that
[0:22:01] <Komayeda> Tropes are story elements, deconstructions are story elements that are dark and i like them
[0:22:02] <DatAsuna> Injustice 2 story mode LP when?
[0:22:08] <Torgue_1> @FuqBoiSlim A deadly hug?!
[0:22:08] <peachy996> I'm still processing that Arkham games copyright the music. But it's not a true loss if you play it silent
[0:22:10] <Equirah> trope is also aplicable since it's your dislike of things that are repeated because they're known to work, doesn't mean all of them are "low quality" @WoolieVersus
[0:22:11] <%megaman_sentinel> poison ivy is hot
[0:22:11] <%orcstr16> You can do any cliched thing well, but tons of works don't. They simply rehash the same ideas over and over. Stand out works take concepts and either execute them flawlessly or they explore a new aspect of them.
[0:22:14] <+skyheys> It is her yes
[0:22:14] <%RyTYoung> uhhhhh

[0:22:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> maaaaaaaaaaaaaybe
[0:22:25] <finalmessenger38> yeah
[0:22:25] <%eyezehuhh> Most likely
[0:22:25] <%Nomad_Scholar> She is partially responsible for the Injustice universe
[0:22:26] <sunnythedrunk> No comment
[0:22:26] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:22:27] <+JaseAdrift> YES

[0:22:43] <arkv01> HOT > CRIMES
[0:22:44] <%chosenjuan42> on Christmas
[0:22:46] <%jinking79> that's New 52 Harley
[0:22:46] <TheWizardOfWordplay> didn't blow-up a whole city
[0:22:46] <CaptainBright> Yay LGBT rights; fuck your minimum wage hikes, AMERICANS
[0:22:47] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Morally grey you see
[0:22:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL

[0:22:48] <emmmdeekay> MORALLY GRAY
[0:22:50] <%wibbwobbler> and then she turned good
[0:22:50] <Goraka91> What a hero
[0:22:51] <whirly25> did margaret thatcher utilize girlpower by...
[0:22:53] <+nabs2099> Gaslight. Gatekeep. GIRLBOSS
[0:22:53] <Mangahero18> Morally Grey means you are a shitty human being who should die for the good of humanity BUT YOU'RE ALSO HOT.
[0:22:54] <Tracazoid> Morally Grey Hotness
[0:22:56] <leith_aziz> You serious ?
[0:23:00] <BigBlackBankai> VEGETA

[0:23:02] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[0:23:03] <+monsieurfantastic> Happy international womans day
[0:23:03] <%phd_in_thuggery> MORALLY GREY
[0:23:04] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Were they purple game boys
[0:23:04] <DatAsuna> I like that comic but she's explicitly not a hero in that one, it ends with her being voluntarily locked up.
[0:23:04] <leith_aziz> What the hell NRS.....
[0:23:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> She got boroed
[0:23:07] <picanoturna> its all good
[0:23:08] <Equirah> Killed *their* time LUL
[0:23:08] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> MORALLY GREY
[0:23:08] <Jaysky> Shut up she's hot so morally grey
[0:23:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> bored*
[0:23:12] <peachy996> Yeah people forget that Villain part of her history
[0:23:12] <arkv01> bro those kids were gonna grow up to be criminals ANYWAYS
[0:23:14] <Torgue_1> Nah, Reggie. To kill kids
[0:23:14] <+0neReeler> but hot
[0:23:14] <MBDiana1> if evil thn y gay tho
[0:23:15] <%Chatterbox1991> More than that, is Poisen Ivy still an eco-terrorist or not?
[0:23:18] <DatAsuna> 2001 yeah
[0:23:20] <%Ranryu692> @WoolieVersus yes, but there are questions with relation to how much blame falls on her versus her manipulative abuser
[0:23:24] <MinersLoveGames> Harley X Poison Ivy has really been something that's gotten a lot of traction over the last few years.
[0:23:26] <MBDiana1> Killer Croc is also married to a anthropomorphic Orca
[0:23:27] <deviljhojho_> but those hotpants tho
[0:23:27] <%runegod20> something that's canon in a single comic isn't canon in all continuities
[0:23:28] <%megaman_sentinel> really
[0:23:29] <journeytogetgood> its in the harley quinn trade paperback
[0:23:29] <+MisleadingEchoes> Moraly grey, she is hot.
[0:23:32] <Komayeda> I mean, neither is Deadpool
[0:23:33] <%phd_in_thuggery> Remember female Joker in the Silver Age?
[0:23:33] <Ciriliko> what???? d:
[0:23:35] <+condemned_15> But "YAAAs QUEEN?"
[0:23:38] <Blank9> Don't judge her, she was in a dark place then, as a matter of fact you should be ashamed of bringing up that part of her life.
[0:23:38] <+Fox_Royal> wait... harley quinn is bad?...
[0:23:39] <picanoturna> what are u implying
[0:23:40] <iwa5h4ck3d> We're bad guys thats what we do
[0:23:42] <crocboyz> what for the 4th time
[0:23:43] <%X2Eliah> WOOLIE BUT REDEMPTION
[0:23:44] <CaptainBright> Gods, last week with the 15$ PERFECT WORLD clip and what happaned in US politics is just fucking P E R F E C T I O N
[0:23:44] <Goraka91> Meanwhile Ivy is straight up genocidal
[0:23:46] <PanicSwytch> This happened in the Injustice comics?
[0:23:47] <Hawkbone_> Bat-Family
[0:23:47] <@Menitta> Harley Quinn was always a villain
[0:23:48] <+DizzyGunner> so no, that's not the harely
[0:23:49] <+twohitgood> harley is joker's gf for a reason.
[0:23:50] <DSD24> Wait is Ocelot a Sigma Male?
[0:23:51] <TallPixels> imagine justifying child murder
[0:23:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Naturally increasing
[0:23:52] <hazel_gem> I feel like that DC has been reeling back with that stuff to make her more of an anti-hero
[0:23:53] <typefruits> posion ivy is also a eco terrorist who kills and mind controls people
[0:23:53] <%chosenjuan42> It's so weird they want to Deadpool her but even Deadpool is aware how horrible he used to be
[0:23:54] <$priceyyeti40> Does it still count if they rebooted and that never happened?
[0:23:55] <arkv01> say what bruce wayne is a sigma male?!
[0:23:55] <leith_aziz> Yes, but they try to write her off as a missplaced vision character
[0:23:56] <%Valask> mu
[0:23:57] <some_brave_apollo> Papa John ended his sub
[0:23:57] <brunoberserk> WELP
[0:23:58] <%Valask> um
[0:24:05] <prime_name> Yeah but that was a different writer so it's fine now
[0:24:06] <%phd_in_thuggery> BRUCE IS THE VIRGIN ALPHA
[0:24:07] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:24:10] <anAngryHamster> LIES
[0:24:11] <%KoopaPrez> hahaha
[0:24:11] <%TopTieramisu> harley was book smart but
[0:24:12] <%zeejaymac> Has anyone turned this stream into an NFT yet?
[0:24:13] <leith_aziz> From the comics
[0:24:14] <%Ranryu692> yeah, that's not canon anymore
[0:24:15] <JetpackMcQuack> BFTOW energy
[0:24:17] <DatAsuna> She does actually trap batman where joker can't too
[0:24:18] <%BusterRepukken> thats definitely not canon anymore
[0:24:23] <@akuda_bar> @zeejaymac i'll turn you into an NFT
[0:24:23] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus Thanks for getting me into Fighting Games. They suck. It took me 3 years to enjoy playing Street Fighter. Keep going you Sigma male!
[0:24:24] <+nabs2099> Bruce doesn't know what sex is.
[0:24:24] <JetpackMcQuack> MGTOW rather
[0:24:25] <Goraka91> Cruella deVille is a misunderstood tragic figure
[0:24:26] <peachy996> She's less crazy in Origins
[0:24:27] <+0neReeler> more normal
[0:24:29] <CaptainBright> there were episodes in the OG series, where Harley was normal
[0:24:30] <%runegod20> it depends on what version you're going for, since there's multiple versions of harley out there
[0:24:30] <DatAsuna> Like he throws her out a window because she upstages him
[0:24:30] <deviljhojho_> it depends on the universe, sometimes she is legit in others she is a quack
[0:24:32] <peachy996> Less ditzy
[0:24:32] <%rottingpastry> She was competent.
[0:24:33] <%jinking79> as long as Damion doesn't exist
[0:24:34] <%Jiggisnipe> she can be booksmart and still an idiot
[0:24:36] <ScrumDyna> I'mma be honest, I like Punchline as Joker's sidekick more.
[0:24:36] <Prevot> If Harley was a good doctor, she wouldn't have fallen for Joker, guys
[0:24:36] <Bloodhit> She is resident for Horni jail
[0:24:37] <dundore77> she can be smart but not arkham shrink level of smart
[0:24:41] <leith_aziz> You could say Joket had an influence
[0:24:44] <%Dante_Namikaze1> she does that on purpose so she could be with the joker but she is still smart
[0:24:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:24:44] <%eyezehuhh> Bruce doesn't know what sex is but Talia does
[0:24:44] <NoireRequiem> Hey yoyoyo!
[0:24:46] <Komayeda> Harley actually nearly came close to killing Batman, ironically only failing cuz Joker interfered.
[0:24:46] <leith_aziz> Joker
[0:24:46] <%aram909> paul dini is not a good writer and it shows, especially in Arkham City
[0:24:46] <+RoboGarda> It's now canon she was smart
[0:24:47] <%HollowedIdjit> Harley is actually smart and competent. she just plays dumb for Joker
[0:24:48] <%Wulfphelz> It's actually funny because the show is implied that she is traumatized by Joker and shes trying to redeem herself with Poison Ivy
[0:24:50] <masterfire23> oh yeah the harley quinn animated series exists
[0:24:52] <domvito1234> but Damien Wayne exists, so how can batman be mega virgin
[0:24:54] <%zeejaymac> @zeejaymac lol
[0:24:55] <eldragon_1> She helped Joker experiment on Tim Drake in Beyond. She bad.
[0:24:58] <%X2Eliah> Oh no its the sound da police
[0:24:58] <+nabs2099> I would like Batman far more if he had the Kiryu "doesn't know what sex is" energy
[0:25:02] <%aram909> @masterfire23 its so fucking good
[0:25:03] <brunoberserk> WE LL BE RIGHT BACK
[0:25:04] <DatAsuna> oh many
[0:25:04] <%jinking79> that sounds like New 52 stuff
[0:25:05] <%Chatterbox1991> JOKER
[0:25:05] <picanoturna> the streets is calling.
[0:25:11] <@Solidus_113> Moon Knight
[0:25:14] <leith_aziz> @aram909: Opions of course, but thats bullshit
[0:25:16] <%aram909> DAREDEVIL
[0:25:16] <DatAsuna> She-Hulk phoenix wright with supervillains/heroes
[0:25:17] <+JaseAdrift> Harley Quinn is "smart" but they dont really show her being smart
[0:25:18] <%Chatterbox1991> Give me a Joker Gang Empire Sim
[0:25:21] <%orcstr16> She IS intelligent, but she was always a bit crazy.
[0:25:22] <%RyTYoung> Black Panther?
[0:25:22] <%jinking79> i could be wrong
[0:25:22] <Torgue_1> @Solidus_113 Yes
[0:25:23] <leith_aziz> Im all for a Beyond game
[0:25:24] <gigamaid> The best joke in the Harley Quinn animated show was when Joker said women aren't funny and then shot the henchman who suggested the idea he disagreed with
[0:25:25] <peachy996> So yeah the music in Asylum will be missed but it's not going to damage your LP too bad. It'll just be weird
[0:25:26] <+RiverKing13> A recent comic brought up that Harley Quinn might be trying to be hero but she totally is responsible for killing people. That is the whole origin of Clownhunter.
[0:25:27] <%gnoame> Static Shock
[0:25:27] <%krispen_wa> BOOSTER GOLD
[0:25:27] <%TopTieramisu> @aram909 easiest game to make

[0:25:28] <BlackermanZX> Man i wish for a Beyond game
[0:25:31] <+0neReeler> they are
[0:25:31] <+condemned_15> I remember one version of her wanted to work at Arkham because she wanted to profit on a book deal about supervillain psychology

[0:26:06] <Darren716> The Woolie AI gets closer everyday
[0:26:07] <Torgue_1> A Woolie cliche?
[0:26:10] <picanoturna> dc is a mess man
[0:26:12] <%chosenjuan42> I wish I liked DC more it's just hard when everytime you hear something happen you have to ask,. Is that cannon?
[0:26:16] <%aram909> a proper Avengers game, not the multiplayer mess we go
[0:26:19] <peachy996> Give me a new X-Men Fighting Game. I NEED it
[0:26:20] <%Superdandy96> DC is a mess
[0:26:22] <DatAsuna> Imagine if avengers had gone for that
[0:26:22] <+skyheys> Isnt that literally what they're doing with the new Arkham game?
[0:26:22] <+nabs2099> Let Insomniac adapt the marvel universe into video games
[0:26:24] <leith_aziz> Fair
[0:26:27] <leith_aziz> I'd like that
[0:26:31] <leith_aziz> YES
[0:26:31] <%Chatterbox1991> A Wooliche?
[0:26:32] <marvel877> Lego Marvel?
[0:26:33] <%chosenjuan42> An actual single player Avengers game
[0:26:35] <%Dante_Namikaze1> I want a game focused on all the street level characters
[0:26:36] <Torgue_1> True
[0:26:38] <Komayeda> Wait, there's a new Arkham Game?
[0:26:38] <notabrobro> highly highly recommend the show doom patrol
[0:26:41] <+skyheys> Isnt that Marvel's Avengers by Square Enix?
[0:26:42] <Arancet> yes, but they may not sell (in marketing's mind)
[0:26:43] <some_brave_apollo> that would work well with Marvel because you could reuse the same NYC environments
[0:26:45] <%krispen_wa> GotG is a good example
[0:26:45] <%aram909> @chosenjuan42 without arkham combat
[0:26:49] <+nabs2099> Wouldn't say supes is in that anymore tbh
[0:26:49] <leith_aziz> Bingo

[0:27:35] <snakest3alth> YOU BIG FUCKING NERD
[0:27:40] <leith_aziz> Asylum tried to be canon to DC in general
[0:27:43] <+BakiinPlaysStuff> Moon Knight hunts down Dracula for his money becaues he's a big nerd
[0:27:43] <+RiverKing13> I feel it is mostly marketing that makes characters hit
[0:27:43] <DatAsuna> it's like a fork timeline yeah
[0:27:44] <peachy996> Yeah
[0:27:44] <@Solidus_113> That Dracula panel is an edit

[0:28:06] <+HeroSolaire> You really shouldn't experience the game with music turned off, you are damaging your first experience
[0:28:09] <peachy996> You'll meet characters you already heard about before in the bios from Asylum
[0:28:10] <rideroftraps1> Inhumans were done wrong
[0:28:10] <%wibbwobbler> niiice

[0:29:00] <%paladinstarbuster> Emiya Shirou
[0:29:01] <%TopTieramisu> ron got shafted
[0:29:01] <BlackermanZX> so why dontcha play some mgs music or sumthin StinkyGlitch
[0:29:01] <%phd_in_thuggery> GOOD BEATem UP
[0:29:03] <TallPixels> when are videos gonna be straight to torrent
[0:29:12] <%TopTieramisu> they gave his good moments to hermione
[0:29:12] <DatAsuna> unless you do awkward voice over thoughts
[0:29:12] <leith_aziz> Thats an interesting thought
[0:29:14] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> Dumbledore asked calmly
[0:29:14] <Blank9> harry potter the jock
[0:29:16] <DSD24> @paladinstarbuster Yep he first came to mind
[0:29:16] <%RyTYoung> Inward narration Kappa
[0:29:17] <%saladin1911> @edenoflove What map?
[0:29:18] <DatAsuna> but for most things that's goofy
[0:29:19] <leith_aziz> Never thought about that
[0:29:21] <daswampken> Take a shot every time you hear steve blum in game
[0:29:23] <MyNameIsRasus> Dumbledore asked super calmly
[0:29:23] <@akuda_bar> @A_DEAD_SHOW CALMLY.
[0:29:24] <%aram909> this is why i like tom holland spiderman over tobey macguire
[0:29:24] <+JaseAdrift> Ron got FUCKED in the movies
[0:29:31] <%aram909> much more in line with the character
[0:29:36] <%aram909> much more talkative and expressive
[0:29:37] <leith_aziz> "Dumbledore asked CALMLY"
[0:29:48] <%paladinstarbuster> @DSD24 Its crazy how he's completely different
[0:29:50] <brunoberserk> boy ,anime adaptations ruined emiya shirou
[0:29:51] <MBDiana1> i dunno, harry potter ended up a cop and a bitch, which seems like the same person as him in the first 4 books
[0:29:55] <MyNameIsRasus> HARRYDIDUPUTURNAMEINTHEGOB-
[0:29:56] <%chosenjuan42> Almost everything you hear in Marvel good or bad is most likely cannon. It's easier to follow in my opinion
[0:30:04] <DSD24> @paladinstarbuster Especially from route to route
[0:30:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> T E X T U R E S
[0:30:15] <%bumpynavel> Yea its real Xbox360.
[0:30:16] <%ZweihanderSteve> goold ol AAA borgor from 09 baybeee
[0:30:16] <some_brave_apollo> probably should've played it 10 years ago
[0:30:17] <Ghostbody> @MBDiana1 PFFFFFTTTT damn
[0:30:19] <leith_aziz> Asylum's bosses arent that good
[0:30:20] <+agbehhhh> I'm optimistic for the Dune film cause that book is ENTIRELY thoughts, so how are they gonna do dat
[0:30:22] <leith_aziz> trust me
[0:30:22] <peachy996> The Bane one sucks
[0:30:24] <+nabs2099> @mbdiana1 LMAO really? is that from that crappy play?
[0:30:25] <HollowMan190> het used to baf boss flights
[0:30:32] <HollowMan190> get bad
[0:30:37] <Asuterisuku> Nothing is locked on in this game.
[0:30:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is anyone else upset that Pat kinda spoiled a bunch of stuff on the podcast? Woolie finding out about the Freeze fight would've been a huge moment
[0:30:41] <peachy996> I think aside from 1 more Boss, Bane is the worst Boss in Asylum
[0:30:43] <+nabs2099> Harry potter is garbage
[0:30:45] <%aram909> welp woolie well uh arkham asylum has only 1 or 2boss fights repeated over the entire game
[0:30:45] <sunnythedrunk> It's unfortunate cuz Arkham really created so many things that are gaming staples now
[0:30:46] <Darren716> I mean the remake doesnt fix those boss fights
[0:30:47] <brunoberserk> arkham city have better boss fights
[0:30:48] <%jinking79> texture as bad as FF7REMAKE texture
[0:30:48] <CrematedCube> It has old mechanics
[0:30:48] <%robo_trunk> JUST MOD IN HD TEXTURES
[0:30:50] <%Chatterbox1991> it only gets worse
[0:30:50] <%Javaa01> Also the remaster doesn't fix anything about the bosses
[0:30:52] <leith_aziz> Bane also is pretty lame in Arkham (outside of Origins where he's cool)
[0:30:59] <%TopTieramisu> i'm optimistic about Dune because DENIS VILLENEUVE
[0:31:00] <%aram909> arkham city and origins have way better boss fights
[0:31:01] <GilliamYaeger> Bam Ham boss fights tend to be bad on the whole
[0:31:02] <NeoseekerStitch> Boooooooooo
[0:31:03] <TallPixels> oh god
[0:31:04] <peachy996> Oh god Arkham City Bane
[0:31:04] <%ZweihanderSteve> time to batsmans
[0:31:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Remaster is really just a re-texture
[0:31:04] <%chosenjuan42> Arkham City has some amazing bosses
[0:31:05] <DiksieNormis> Yasuke anime announced Kreygasm
[0:31:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Get punchmom to beatbox the OST
[0:31:07] <%Superdandy96> I think Bane‚Äôs probably the worse of the boss fights
[0:31:08] <leith_aziz> City gets SO much better with bosses
[0:31:09] <sunnythedrunk> Like without Arkham we wouldn't have a good spiderman game
[0:31:10] <Blank9> no music, no physx, just riddler audio to keep you company
[0:31:13] <+skyheys> is this the Hush arc?
[0:31:13] <Goraka91> What a world we live in
[0:31:15] <+RiverKing13> Boss fights are the worst part of this game.
[0:31:15] <%RyTYoung> What about a music mod @woolieversus ?
[0:31:15] <DSD24> So where's Woolie at in Asylum right now?
[0:31:15] <brunoberserk> LP IS DAMAGED
[0:31:19] <leith_aziz> Origins is the best with bosses
[0:31:20] <%saladin1911> @keiganofastora Nah, he'll probably forget by the time he ever gets around to that
[0:31:21] <%aram909> @chosenjuan42 mr freeze was one of the best
[0:31:21] <+nabs2099> Asylum and Knight had crap bosses. City and Origins had great bosses.
[0:31:22] <%X2Eliah> Batman without music is just the "real-world-authentic-experience"
[0:31:29] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah Arkham City has 100x better boss fights
[0:31:29] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus has twitch had any issues with the music in the VODs?
[0:31:31] <leith_aziz> But Knight's bosses suck
[0:31:34] <+RiverKing13> what if the music is really low
[0:31:35] <Nuclearcherries> Arkham Asylum is weird to play since it inspired so many other games - especially combat
[0:31:36] <%RyTYoung> boooo
[0:31:36] <DelgotHansto> Arkham Knights bosses range from incredibly amazing to unbelievably disappointing
[0:31:39] <Asuterisuku> No workshop, but you CAN go to the Nexus.
[0:31:40] <%Superdandy96> Just have Reggie sing the music Kappa
[0:31:42] <+MightyDuckShoes> is there a place for DMCA proofing mods that tweak the tracks enough?

[0:31:58] <VyCade> If it‚Äôs any consolation, I‚Äôve played through multiple times and the music is hardly what I‚Äôd describe as ‚Äúmemorable.‚Äù
[0:31:59] <leith_aziz> Sigh
[0:31:59] <NumbF4ke> @sunnythedrunk I won't abide that slander, ps1 spider man game was the shit
[0:32:01] <%chosenjuan42> !Motivated
[0:32:02] <@Moobot> 2094 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:32:06] <+nabs2099> Maybe there's a BTAS OST mod
[0:32:09] <%ZweihanderSteve> does batman have a DP, or are the invincibility frames too much prep time LUL
[0:32:11] <%TopTieramisu> the best batman game would be a game where you set up the perfect trap to beat supers that are way out of his league in strength
[0:32:13] <DelgotHansto> All that work for the Deathstroke fight...
[0:32:16] <+LeaIsChill> That three link paragraph in chat is just miserable huh? LUL
[0:32:18] <peachy996> @nabs2099 I think the pseudo-bosses in Asylum are better than the actual boss fights
[0:32:22] <DelgotHansto> For it to suck soo much ass...
[0:32:24] <%aram909> there may be a way to live-tweak the sound in playback to pitch it up or down, thus skirting DMCA
[0:32:26] <DSD24> Its meant to be played
[0:32:26] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus harley quin gets her og suit in an arkham knight dlc
[0:32:29] <MBDiana1> you have to make your own mods to make things good, just like Batman
[0:32:33] <chainsaw105> good news everyone, I have nachos
[0:32:35] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @delgothansto and it's still the best fight in the game
[0:32:39] <DrkJP520> Sing for us instead, Reggie
[0:32:40] <%jinking79> man Knight ruin Deathstroke
[0:32:41] <Goraka91> ...
[0:32:41] <%aram909> maybe feed the audio through a twitch-shift plugin
[0:32:42] <picanoturna> i feel it
[0:32:45] <+Stormiercashew> did woolie upgrade to a gtx 9700 since last session?
[0:32:46] <leith_aziz> Does tthis work ? i'd be fine with this ?
[0:32:48] <NeoseekerStitch> I hope there's no cutscenes that are music volume based for all the sounds
[0:32:48] <Hawkbone_> Oh wow, this is already awkward without music
[0:32:49] <emmmdeekay> wait, the music from this can get woolie DMCA'd?
[0:32:53] <Halospaz117> Oh god it's hittin already
[0:32:55] <emmmdeekay> FUCK WARNER
[0:32:55] <%saladin1911> @chainsaw105 You got dip?
[0:32:55] <%aram909> or you can do it in post
[0:32:56] <Mangahero18> It would be cool if there was a mod that messed around with the music JUST a little bit so the bots couldnt send automated messages back to their shitty corporate masters.
[0:32:58] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @mdkcde yes
[0:33:03] <%chosenjuan42> Can PC run Arkham Asylum at MAX SETTINGS
[0:33:04] <BlackermanZX> is the game audio a bit low
[0:33:06] <leith_aziz> Dammit I feel the silence
[0:33:06] <+nabs2099> @peachy996 Pseudo bosses? Like those titan thugs?
[0:33:07] <peachy996> Already weird
[0:33:09] <Necnill> Play Hatsune Miku instead

[0:34:05] <+skyheys> topical
[0:34:09] <phantalime> just replace it all with Deadly Premonition whistles
[0:34:09] <DSD24> Wouldn't the batman NES music still cause issues?
[0:34:11] <BlackermanZX> volume is a bit low

[0:34:19] <Asuterisuku> Above minimum for 2009, but still not enough money for this.
[0:34:20] <%TopTieramisu> bruce wayne absolutely has the best insurance money can buy
[0:34:20] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS IS SUPER WEIRD
[0:34:21] <Necnill> PS1ish vibes

[0:34:26] <hazeprojekt> volume low
[0:34:27] <+el_hearto> fuck WB
[0:34:28] <+LeaIsChill> "Unplayable" comes to mind
[0:34:30] <+skyheys> ITS ARTSY NOW
[0:34:31] <Dante_Namikaze1> Voice audio too low
[0:34:31] <%Noonoox12> Decision time
[0:34:31] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> this feels wrong
[0:34:32] <leith_aziz> Like general audio
[0:34:33] <%patriotrenegade> BOSS! GET DOWN! The enemy sniper...
[0:34:33] <%Noonoox12> put it on low
[0:34:34] <picanoturna> fuck WB

[0:34:47] <%KoopaPrez> just have Reggie sing
[0:34:47] <+admiral_of_crunch> This is the destruction of art, WB
[0:34:47] <+Rosy_Joan> can you put on a fancover playlist?
[0:34:48] <%cache_22> The audio could probably be bumped up a bit. Could you play background whitenoise or something?
[0:34:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> This isn't fun for you at all, play the games off-stream
[0:34:51] <%X2Eliah> Hey wait wasn't woolie at the bottom of the sewer maze puzzle at the end of last stream?
[0:34:51] <+Ancopro> katamari music is safe i hear
[0:34:52] <TallPixels> play a mixtape
[0:34:53] <leith_aziz> Maybe some DCAU music ?
[0:34:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Dude, it's not worth the LP
[0:34:56] <@akuda_bar> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[0:34:56] <BlackermanZX> This is a stealthish game so MGS music kinda fits
[0:34:56] <+nabs2099> Woolz don't worry about it man, just play it. We won't mind.
[0:34:58] <Daxalog> !votekick Batman: Arham Asylum
[0:34:58] <+0neReeler> the world we wished for
[0:34:59] <+skyheys> I LIKE IT

[0:35:00] <%RyTYoung> Have the music up by %q
[0:35:00] <+DizzyGunner> this is too weird
[0:35:00] <MyNameIsRasus> CAST ASIDE THERE'S NO COMING HOME
[0:35:01] <HeavyManaBeast2> paws
[0:35:03] <+admiral_of_crunch> Play the Overlord 2 theme
[0:35:04] <emmmdeekay> Batman NES
[0:35:04] <leith_aziz> Batman Beyond has some sick tracks
[0:35:04] <Hawkbone_> Fuck it, its not worth it
[0:35:05] <CaptainBright> Is metal gear music fine?
[0:35:05] <Darren716> Man thanks WB
[0:35:06] <DrkJP520> Find some ambient music
[0:35:06] <peachy996> Big Batman thinks
[0:35:07] <%RyTYoung> 1%*
[0:35:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Play the game on your own time
[0:35:09] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @iLike_femboys (warning)
[0:35:09] <%Chatterbox1991> Persona Music?
[0:35:10] <CaptainBright> Maybe metroid?
[0:35:11] <brunoberserk> WOOLIE IS THINKING ...
[0:35:11] <VidulaSaix> Its legitimately going to ruin the experience and the LP at this rate
[0:35:12] <arkv01> overlay kirby?
[0:35:13] <Doctadaking> Just play nothing. Playing background music probably won‚Äôt sync right anyway
[0:35:13] <BlackermanZX> Hell John halo, Mgs, metroid
[0:35:13] <emmmdeekay> Play Batman chiptunes in the background
[0:35:13] <%Noonoox12> Heck the vod or switch to a different game?
[0:35:14] <%aram909> edit it in post
[0:35:14] <%chosenjuan42> is it possible to just put music low and dialogue up?
[0:35:15] <leith_aziz> You know what ? Use MGS music
[0:35:15] <splinter1619> honestly just play it off screen if you can
[0:35:16] <@akuda_bar> maybe edit in the cutscene audio using no commentary footage?
[0:35:16] <$StaceMcGate> LP cancelled
[0:35:17] <exnuart> wb canceling the lp
[0:35:18] <SheefEatsBeef> Fuck.
[0:35:18] <%Mtome> Just play it on your own time
[0:35:18] <Jaysky> Woolz you shouldn't stream this anymore if you can't get the music for the whole series
[0:35:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus You're not getting the proper experience without music
[0:35:18] <leith_aziz> It fits
[0:35:18] <+nabs2099> Is there any royalty free batman-y music tracks u can play?
[0:35:18] <%Noonoox12> TIME FOR DARK SOULS 1 REMASTERED?
[0:35:19] <picanoturna> video games huh
[0:35:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Tartarus Theme from P3 on loop
[0:35:20] <+Chronobot> the soundtrack and ambiance make the game
[0:35:21] <DSD24> Batman NES music?
[0:35:21] <+LeaIsChill> Persona music is such a funny suggestion LUL
[0:35:22] <Tooniearcade> Bloodborne music
[0:35:22] <TomosukeUsagi> Can look up royalty free music on youtube LUL
[0:35:22] <+condemned_15> it's not worth it. Just play as is
[0:35:22] <%ZweihanderSteve> WB what the fuck
[0:35:24] <%X2Eliah> Might need to cancel the LP
[0:35:25] <Hawkbone_> This game is not worth it without the music
[0:35:25] <leith_aziz> MGS music
[0:35:25] <%Chatterbox1991> Castlevania wouldn't be that off point @WoolieVersus
[0:35:25] <%marrs_bars> It's fine!
[0:35:26] <peachy996> What if you kept it low
[0:35:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> fuck wb it aint worth it @woolieversus
[0:35:27] <%aram909> keep the music in-stream but edit the sound in post before putting it on youtube
[0:35:27] <HeavyManaBeast2> its not worth it
[0:35:29] <Necnill> Let chat make a copyright free playlist for you
[0:35:30] <%Superdandy96> Can we play remix Batman songs?
[0:35:32] <%bumpynavel> Honestly I'm a psychopath and play alot of games without music anyway lol.
[0:35:33] <%wibbwobbler> considering a playlist?
[0:35:33] <+JacknZack27> Maybe the trick is to play it quietly
[0:35:33] <Foopoof> Why not just make the vods sub only
[0:35:33] <+Fox_Royal> batman type beats incoming
[0:35:35] <sunnythedrunk> Record Commentary and Video sepearately
[0:35:38] <%Jiggisnipe> someone suggested the NES Batman ost
[0:35:41] <iLike_femboys> just beat box dude
[0:35:41] <peachy996> Like 20 % music levels
[0:35:43] <Halospaz117> Batman Beyond theme on a loop
[0:35:43] <%KoopaPrez> Play the audio, but dont play the game!
[0:35:44] <brunoberserk> PLAY ARKHAM CITY MUSIC ??
[0:35:45] <+Iamdenril> you gotta have the music man
[0:35:46] <leith_aziz> Lets not cancel the LP
[0:35:46] <splinter1619> make it a stream vod only playthrough?
[0:35:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> You NEED the music
[0:35:49] <%orcstr16> You could grab some free gothic music that could fit the bill.
[0:35:50] <Hawkbone_> Its a batman game with one of the best batman soundtracks ever
[0:35:50] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Music is important for these games.
[0:35:51] <Teradyne87> Call in the free use musicians!
[0:35:51] <BlackermanZX> Stealth games OST
[0:35:53] <+Gohyakuen> the music is super good
[0:35:54] <%Superdandy96> Yeah NES Batman could be good
[0:35:55] <leith_aziz> Does CITY music work ?
[0:35:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's just not the same without music dude
[0:36:01] <iLike_femboys> berdSalty berdSalty
[0:36:02] <%Noonoox12> Emergency dark souls 1?
[0:36:03] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @BigBlackBankai
[0:36:05] <%RyTYoung> @leith_aziz I fucking hope so
[0:36:05] <leith_aziz> Even DCAU music works
[0:36:07] <+nabs2099> Pls don't cancel the LP :(
[0:36:08] <MBDiana1> have minh beatbox the music while editing
[0:36:09] <arkv01> YES EMERGENCY DARK SOULS
[0:36:09] <Doctadaking> Music is mostly ambient
[0:36:13] <%Stupid121v2> Its a rough choice
[0:36:13] <DelgotHansto> MGS OST would be odd
[0:36:13] <peachy996> The music to Asylum isn't essential but it really sets the mood
[0:36:14] <+Mr_Pylon> Oh I missed the intro, is the music getting DMCA'd by WB?
[0:36:15] <%Superdandy96> Dark souls could work
[0:36:16] <+DaBigVitus> video games are dead
[0:36:16] <glass_marcus> Is this the real Persona 5 part 2?
[0:36:18] <+0neReeler> any decent filter/software that mutes ambient sounds? rtx?
[0:36:19] <%Pillagius> Yeah... Neither really lets you play the game, basically killing your desire to stream them along with any publicity for these games...
[0:36:21] <TallPixels> cant be muted in post?
[0:36:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Bloodborne
[0:36:23] <splinter1619> stream vod only lp
[0:36:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Play the game off-stream and enjoy it properly
[0:36:30] <%Noonoox12> RIP youtube?
[0:36:32] <@akuda_bar> vod only?
[0:36:33] <DSD24> @Mr_Pylon Yes
[0:36:35] <rytisone> curse you WB
[0:36:36] <%Noonoox12> Twitch-only?
[0:36:36] <%X2Eliah> Batman without the atmospheric experience is gonna turn this game into a MUCH WORSE experience for you woolz
[0:36:36] <leith_aziz> Twitch only then ?
[0:36:41] <+HeroSolaire> Ditch youtube
[0:36:41] <frostyjay3> :-( This shit makes me genuinely sad. All these creatives pour their hearts out to create content and some shitty DMCA rules just fuck them over for no reason. Homie is just tryna make a living doing what he loves and it sucks.
[0:36:44] <CrematedCube> The fact that It's reactive music is the dilemma
[0:36:47] <+Fnir> Not uploading to YT ?
[0:36:51] <VidulaSaix> It's not worth ruining the game itself
[0:36:53] <+Deekman> On to Dark Souls!
[0:36:54] <+Mr_Pylon> @DSD24 damn
[0:36:55] <Hawkbone_> Honestly this is so weird I'm thinking it'd be worth it to cancel the LP for your own sake if there's no other option.
[0:36:57] <%Stupid121v2> hate how hard creators work just to get fucked like this
[0:36:58] <leith_aziz> If views dont affect TOO much, you can stick to Twitch
[0:36:59] <TomosukeUsagi> DMCA: Whack-a-mole edition
[0:36:59] <arkv01> game over yeeeeah?
[0:37:00] <splinter1619> twitch only bois
[0:37:01] <emmmdeekay> Is there a mod for the music?
[0:37:01] <CaptainBright> Y'all wankas trying to screw over the anime viewers, huh
[0:37:03] <TigerClaws12> 10s manga vids that link to anime VoD?
[0:37:03] <picanoturna> youtube can sit this one out
[0:37:05] <wolfen091> just play some classical like cello or bass in the background
[0:37:05] <Dio_TR> Do it like pat did with P5
[0:37:05] <radar410> These games really aren't worth playing without the music, especially City. Some segments just don't work without it
[0:37:07] <leith_aziz> But its your channel of course
[0:37:07] <%Pillagius> @X2Eliah but what can he do about it?..
[0:37:08] <sunnythedrunk> Record Commentary separately then have Minh use different music
[0:37:13] <splinter1619> rip
[0:37:13] <Asuterisuku> But then Youtube would still lose the voice acting.
[0:37:14] <+skyheys> lmao
[0:37:14] <DatAsuna> that defeats the purpose
[0:37:15] <%Stupid121v2> youtube is $$$
[0:37:18] <%Stupid121v2> gotta have it
[0:37:19] <BlackermanZX> do ya have some game atmospheric music
[0:37:19] <leith_aziz> ok, I get it
[0:37:20] <+HeroSolaire> Not worth ruining your experience for youtube, Youtube can just sit this one out
[0:37:20] <%Superdandy96> Double record? One with audio and one without? But that‚Äôs too much work.
[0:37:20] <rytisone> 1960's batman music over the gameplay
[0:37:23] <Clundy> This situation genuinely sucks
[0:37:23] <%Jiggisnipe> Woolie is a youtuber guys lol
[0:37:24] <enerkaizer> The reggie-soundtrack for Arkham asylum is still a no-go?
[0:37:26] <+monsieurfantastic> no
[0:37:27] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie's Channel is what keeps him up
[0:37:28] <picanoturna> yeah..
[0:37:29] <+LeaIsChill> Batman is DEAD
[0:37:29] <%CodenameChaz> Any way to do a separate audio recording for game's music? That way the stream audio is fine, and you just swap for a different music file altogether for the YT version?
[0:37:30] <arkv01> youtube pays the bills people
[0:37:32] <leith_aziz> Its fine, Woolie
[0:37:32] <sunnythedrunk> Record Commentary separately then have Minh use different music?
[0:37:33] <+Gohyakuen> Do it woolie! Youtube is too powerful to be left alive!
[0:37:33] <%Jiggisnipe> the twitch is just live recordings
[0:37:34] <%X2Eliah> @Pillagius Well, better that he plays the game offscreen for himself
[0:37:34] <chainsaw105> the clear solution here is to upload it to Dailymotion
[0:37:35] <%RyTYoung> Valid
[0:37:35] <+DaBigVitus> i'm amazed the channel makes more money than the stream
[0:37:36] <%Noonoox12> Switch to another game, I guess?
[0:37:37] <%orcstr16> It'll especially fuck up an upcoming scarecrow segment. It might be worth it to mute the game on youtube. It sucks, but you would still recieve full enjoyment. It seems like the better of the two evils because people mostly want your reaction to the game. We can play the game if we want dialogue.
[0:37:38] <@akuda_bar> valid
[0:37:38] <brunoberserk> MONEY IS IMPORTANT
[0:37:38] <+Fnir> understandable
[0:37:39] <leith_aziz> Fair
[0:37:40] <+ChancellorOfLights> the first episode is why im heare
[0:37:40] <%Valask> manga master race zekeKEK
[0:37:41] <%wibbwobbler> pretty tricky
[0:37:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> YouTube is where it's at, this is just behind-the-scenes shit
[0:37:43] <+monsieurfantastic> look after your channels
[0:37:44] <BreakersAweigh> fair
[0:37:44] <HeavyManaBeast2> yah
[0:37:46] <deafmelone> Understandable
[0:37:47] <splinter1619> money is fair
[0:37:49] <%doomerskeletor13> I guess just mute the music
[0:37:49] <iLike_femboys> we gotta have money
[0:37:53] <leith_aziz> WOOLIE ITS UNDERSTANDABLE
[0:37:54] <+skyheys> pay mr. wb Kappa
[0:37:56] <+Stupid121v2> Any mods on steam maybe?
[0:37:57] <@akuda_bar> the Woolie Versus Empire
[0:37:57] <themightyseptopus> no music is fine
[0:37:57] <$arcielardor> play everhood instead?
[0:37:58] <+Deekman> Dark Souls baby lets go!
[0:37:58] <TheWizardOfWordplay> could you record the game and mic separate? combine it later?
[0:37:58] <+panlakes> fuck this industry man
[0:37:59] <VidulaSaix> Honestly it's a shitty situation for Minh but whack-a-mole is probably the best option without ruining it for either yourselves or Youtuber viewers
[0:38:03] <DatAsuna> just divide the empire in half, worked fine for rome :P
[0:38:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> play injustice music as a replacement? @woolieversus
[0:38:05] <emmmdeekay> Let's watch some HADES!
[0:38:05] <rytisone> experience vs money
[0:38:09] <leith_aziz> City music ?
[0:38:11] <MBDiana1> gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
[0:38:11] <%rottingpastry> royalty free music for twitch/youtube?
[0:38:12] <%TopTieramisu> believe it
[0:38:14] <%aram909> pitch shift the in-game audio by 2 or 3 semitones, youtube wont catch it
[0:38:15] <+Stormiercashew> look into some royalty free ambiance to out up in the background
[0:38:15] <%patriotrenegade> o no
[0:38:17] <+RiverKing13> Fight the claim. Apparently it isn't Warner Bros who is DMCAing.
[0:38:20] <%kullumanati> New game?
[0:38:21] <%Pillagius> @Pillagius I guess... Stull it's a band aid on blown off limb
[0:38:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> could put injustice music in the background to replace it?
[0:38:21] <iLike_femboys> just pay in doll hairs wollie
[0:38:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> What if we just donate like madmen in order to cover the loss
[0:38:23] <leith_aziz> Or DCAU music. Hell, try MGS music
[0:38:24] <%X2Eliah> DATTEBAYO, Robin.
[0:38:26] <emmmdeekay> Woolie needs to get back into HADES anyway
[0:38:26] <%emperordread> Nothing described as a "Naruto situation" can be good
[0:38:27] <DelgotHansto> Pitch audio down lol
[0:38:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> pitch shift does work often, yeah
[0:38:29] <rosemon5001> sad batfist holding it up understandable uhnCry
[0:38:29] <DatAsuna> SWTOR has similar DMCA problems all the time
[0:38:31] <+nabs2099> @woolieversus Would it be possible to download or maybe even create a mod for the games, where there's Batman-ish music
[0:38:33] <%Dante_Namikaze1> No music is fine it was just the voices were to low
[0:38:34] <+LeaIsChill> Dear lord LUL
[0:38:36] <HeavyManaBeast2> there has to something that can be done?
[0:38:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> if it's audio that's the issue
[0:38:36] <+NYCrownlessKing> play injustice music as a replacement? @woolieversus
[0:38:38] <DatAsuna> damn movie music
[0:38:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Both Bruce and Naruto have no parents
[0:38:38] <+skyheys> I'd rather no music tbh
[0:38:39] <+BananaSlammuh> Play it normally on Twitch and Reggie dubs the YT version
[0:38:46] <+0neReeler> nordvpn sponsor
[0:38:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:38:47] <@akuda_bar> get your mans on the phone
[0:38:49] <@Solidus_113> Injustice also gets DMCAs
[0:38:50] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus could you upload it to youtube and make a note to see the uncut version go to the twitch VOD
[0:38:52] <WoawDesu> nes batman stage music
[0:38:52] <%Stupid121v2> the music rules but we do what we gotta do
[0:38:56] <Clundy> Maybe do more of a ‚Äústream highlight‚Äù style video for the lp to avoid the flags?
[0:38:57] <puluxor> Damn asakuraWack
[0:38:57] <+monsieurfantastic> play the max anarchy soundtrack over it
[0:39:00] <picanoturna> Woolie will figure it out
[0:39:02] <%krispen_wa> put the music in a separate audio track using arcane magic
[0:39:03] <+HeroSolaire> Just mute the videos on youtube ResidentSleeper like u did with naruto
[0:39:04] <NoireRequiem> @NYCrownlessKing damn, but arkham music is actually good
[0:39:06] <BlackermanZX> maybe just put another ost that doesn't get ya flagged
[0:39:06] <Teradyne87> Woolie VS. executive meeting
[0:39:06] <Equirah> We can take no music, youtube is still your focus right? @WoolieVersus
[0:39:07] <leith_aziz> Maybe remove music on Youtube, but replace it with commentary ?
[0:39:09] <%X2Eliah> @Deekman Wooliee needs to have the views on youtube though
[0:39:10] <BigBlackBankai> Wouldn't DCAU music have the same problem?
[0:39:10] <baseballthedog> Neither Batman or naruto had parents so I think it fits
[0:39:11] <leith_aziz> Could be fun
[0:39:14] <arkv01> get minh to do a button for button playthrough without the music
[0:39:17] <JinJun1738> No North Korea BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:39:19] <%aram909> its gonna take a lot of clever editing before posting to youtube but you can edit the music appropriately
[0:39:22] <Asuterisuku> Might have to brute force it.
[0:39:22] <peachy996> It's just so bizarre you have to deal with this DMCA shit because aside from one song in a bar there's no real music in the Arkham games. It's all musical score to set the mood.
[0:39:24] <+condemned_15> just leave the music out period
[0:39:30] <VidulaSaix> @Equirah Its not us, no music makes the game itself feel like shit and at that point the game isnt really even worth playing
[0:39:31] <@Solidus_113> Tell the people to play arkham music in the background
[0:39:32] <Artoo_The_Me> Pitch shift sound post edit?
[0:39:36] <+Deekman> @Deekman he still makes money off the ads on twitch
[0:39:36] <%doomerskeletor13> I‚Äôve never heard of that being an issue for these games before, huh
[0:39:41] <@akuda_bar> say hi to minh for us
[0:39:42] <Hawkbone_> Maybe use this LP as a chance to shill a VPN sponsor?
[0:39:42] <leith_aziz> Okay im sticking with my MGS music idea
[0:39:43] <%rottingpastry> Danny Elfman's score is big money
[0:39:45] <arkv01> its not just weird for the viewers, its also weirding woolie out unfortunately
[0:39:45] <+nabs2099> Take your time Woolz. we with u
[0:39:47] <mesamus> cut the music so you dont end up with headaches
[0:39:47] <+Gohyakuen> I would rather have the music here... but if you want to focus on youtube it's fine to mute it
[0:39:47] <brunoberserk> fuck it , put bloodborne/castlevania music
[0:39:48] <HeavyManaBeast2> take your time
[0:39:49] <%chosenjuan42> DMCA Batman's ultimate Rival
[0:39:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dark Souls time with Reggie!!!
[0:39:57] <%RyTYoung> Woolie, Reggie and Mihn will figure it out
[0:39:57] <%X2Eliah> @Deekman yeah like 5% or so
[0:40:00] <phantalime> I would just get rid of game audio in the youtube vid and replace it but idk about how others would feel
[0:40:00] <kulmoth> if only there were a way to have the music on stream but record it without the music
[0:40:03] <+LeaIsChill> I have lofi on in the background LUL
[0:40:04] <%Noonoox12> I think it's super weird
[0:40:05] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah just replace the audio on youtube tbh
[0:40:06] <%eyezehuhh> We're doing it live!
[0:40:09] <peachy996> If it feels weird to you I can't blame you
[0:40:10] <%Stupid121v2> ITS TRUE
[0:40:11] <Darren716> I can't believe WB care this much about bgm from a 12 year old game
[0:40:11] <%runegod20> it'd suck but you can do without it
[0:40:11] <DSD24> You Woolie
[0:40:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't care for me, I care about your experience
[0:40:12] <%Stupid121v2> we have
[0:40:12] <+Deekman> @Deekman youtube's not much better tbh
[0:40:13] <%orcstr16> Would you ever consider going patreon so that you could go full Jim Sterling scorched earth?
[0:40:13] <Asuterisuku> I would rather have the music, absolutely.
[0:40:14] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:40:15] <VidulaSaix> I don't personally care but I don't want the first experience ruined
[0:40:15] <iLike_femboys> zack snyder going after woolie's money :(
[0:40:16] <dinnydanny777> I like music
[0:40:16] <%X2Eliah> Tbh yeah that small moment without music felt kinda rough
[0:40:16] <TomosukeUsagi> Yes this is true LUL
[0:40:16] <+nabs2099> Do what makes it your experience better Woolie
[0:40:16] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus : Try MGS, DCAU or other arkham music
[0:40:17] <%The_Mcmuffin> i never played it
[0:40:18] <%Pillagius> Ideally I'd rather you have best experience.
[0:40:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Exactly
[0:40:19] <%doomerskeletor13> That‚Äôs fair
[0:40:20] <TigerClaws12> can you mod it to have royalty free music? LUL
[0:40:20] <Jaysky> You could do it off stream
[0:40:20] <+McSoliace> same honestly
[0:40:21] <%eyezehuhh> True lol
[0:40:21] <NeoseekerStitch> Wish the DMCA would just go after real issues instead of this nonsense.
[0:40:21] <+admiral_of_crunch> Minh's a cool dude
[0:40:22] <coldfire0007> Got to think about #1
[0:40:22] <Asuterisuku> But Youtube being the way it is...
[0:40:22] <Equirah> @VidulaSaix i see, i looked away for a bit and didn't catch that
[0:40:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> For you, you need the music
[0:40:24] <Artoo_The_Me> Put omikron music instead
[0:40:25] <+Damie904> Na I get it. Arkham is a fuck ton of walking and having no music at all feels way too jarring.
[0:40:25] <%wibbwobbler> different audio attached to the upload? idklol
[0:40:27] <+skyheys> BE UNHAPPY Kappa
[0:40:27] <TallPixels> music is super important for a stealth game
[0:40:27] <NoireRequiem> No music is a damn shame
[0:40:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> You need the proper experience
[0:40:29] <+0neReeler> music is big
[0:40:29] <arkv01> still REAL TO ME
[0:40:30] <CrematedCube> For some reason I somehow knew this OST had copyright goblins galore
[0:40:32] <+ClericOfSparda> very true
[0:40:33] <jaysondeez> would rather twitch and YouTube and DMCA not suck ass
[0:40:34] <%LoVezineTheAir> woolie calls minh to check up on his diabetes
[0:40:34] <sleepy_pixels> play it without music and we can play our own 4Head
[0:40:34] <%Pillagius> But then again would be nice see you experience this shit properly
[0:40:34] <rideroftraps1> First time too
[0:40:35] <exnuart> the music is needed
[0:40:35] <+HeroSolaire> Dude don't ruin your first time playing this game, your experience matters the most
[0:40:36] <%Stupid121v2> omikron fight song over all copyright scenes
[0:40:36] <BlackermanZX> You do you woolz
[0:40:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I care about music and I beat it, but I would like there to be a definitive answer so no one has to worry about this
[0:40:37] <CaptainBright> God fuck, this is a real shitshow
[0:40:37] <sunnythedrunk> Record Commentary separately and then use different sound for the game on youtube
[0:40:37] <%jmpeil> Take Reggie to the wonderful world of Yakuza instead
[0:40:38] <%gitgouda> lol omikron music.
[0:40:39] <+panlakes> and would matter to those who like a complete experience who've played it before
[0:40:40] <@akuda_bar> wouldnt it be cool if you could separate the music channel out in recording
[0:40:40] <rytisone> troubles of being a streamer
[0:40:40] <HeavyManaBeast2> yah, music is important to first run
[0:40:41] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> You should replace the music in the youtube vids with your own self-made mixtape.
[0:40:42] <%rottingpastry> I don't remember the music being particularly impactful. Just imagine the batman theme sting whenever something cool happens lol
[0:40:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Thanks Brothers Warner
[0:40:42] <FrostedZaibatsu> Whatever is the road with least resistance, yknow
[0:40:43] <%Superdandy96> Kinda like what @solidus_113 said, @woolieversus you could play without music and just ask the YouTube viewers play some Arkham music on a separate tab.
[0:40:43] <slix3431> Imagine halo without the music
[0:40:43] <brunoberserk> the important is woolie's experience ... AND THE MONEY
[0:40:45] <+JacknZack27> Its really weird without music...
[0:40:47] <Hawkbone_> I'd be fine with the LP getting delayed until a solution is found
[0:40:48] <+admiral_of_crunch> Yeah, music is a huge part of the atmosphere. It'd be a shame to rob yourself of it.
[0:40:51] <Equirah> @can you mute game audio through the capture device?
[0:40:52] <DrkJP520> Storm the dmca people
[0:40:53] <+skyheys> Zack Snyder did this
[0:40:57] <+eel_cream> Upload it to Vimeo
[0:40:57] <leith_aziz> hmmm
[0:40:58] <%X2Eliah> The thing is, Arkham Asylum gameplay is not ideal, and graphics are not great either. That whole game is about ATMOSPHERE
[0:41:01] <sullivansbizarreadventure> Music is an important part of any first time playing a game
[0:41:02] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! I'm pretty sure DMCA was created by The Riddler
[0:41:02] <%X2Eliah> No music fucks it up
[0:41:03] <Jashter18> Get Little V to score the game LIVE
[0:41:03] <Asuterisuku> Inpromptu Reggie vs. Dark Souls?
[0:41:04] <sunnythedrunk> I think it'll be fine but youtube vod is gonna be lacking
[0:41:04] <dinnydanny777> Play Bugsnax music and nothing but Bugsnax music
[0:41:06] <%The_Mcmuffin> put adam west batman music in
[0:41:06] <VidulaSaix> This is why Youtube is a mistake LUL
[0:41:08] <Jathspuh> make V cover it on the spot
[0:41:10] <enerkaizer> again, my vote goes to Reggies new live Batman soundtrack
[0:41:12] <dukeoftime> The music is really good, would be a shame to miss out...
[0:41:12] <%eyezehuhh> Stop the DMCA
[0:41:12] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus this sucks because the music in this games is legendary
[0:41:13] <%RyTYoung> Yari Yari Daze Kappa
[0:41:14] <@akuda_bar> let's do a Reggie AMA LUL
[0:41:14] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus welcome to the pain of being a classic GTA fan who streams; every game is made by its music and streaming them is a DMCA nightmare
[0:41:15] <%bumpynavel> I just enjoy some games more without music because much immersion.
[0:41:15] <Clundy> Snyder cut comes out in 9 days
[0:41:17] <masterfire23> I was rewatching the naruto lp earlier today
[0:41:21] <leith_aziz> Yare Yare Daze....
[0:41:22] <casualshinji> So I take it Warner Bros. is as bad as Ghibli?
[0:41:24] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus Did you guys get the email yet that Youtube is going to start taking taxes for international accounts soon
[0:41:25] <@Solidus_113> Could you drop the music low enough to still hear it, but get masked out through your commentary and regular game sfx? @WoolieVersus
[0:41:27] <Doctadaking> It‚Äôs simple. We shut down WB
[0:41:31] <CaptainBright> Editing for Minh would be more taxing
[0:41:32] <MyNameIsRasus> @dinnydanny777 "Kinda man and kinda bat"
[0:41:32] <dinnydanny777> Sea Shanty 2
[0:41:34] <peachy996> Yeah a silent Arkham Asylum would be robbed of its atmosphere
[0:41:36] <+skyheys> kill batman
[0:41:37] <iLike_femboys> welcome to youtube where everything is more complicated that it needs to be
[0:41:38] <%KoopaPrez> Play a diff game and mull on it?
[0:41:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> There's no mixing in the game??
[0:41:45] <@Menitta> First WB sabotaged Zach Snyder and now Woolie
[0:41:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's fuck if WB strikes at gameplay, it's not like Capcom being mad about people just putting scores up, this is game and the background music is part of the game.
[0:41:45] <Artoo_The_Me> Y‚Äôall hear the YouTube monertization 24% cut?
[0:41:48] <peachy996> Arkham Asylum: A Silent House on Serious Earth
[0:41:48] <%Superdandy96> @deekman you‚Äôre kidding me. Ugh...
[0:41:50] <BlackermanZX> yeah anything as long it doesn't tax minh
[0:41:53] <%aram909> pitch shift the audio in post. its just unfortunate that the youtube audience will either get a slightly deeper batman or slightly squeakier batman voice
[0:41:53] <sunnythedrunk> I like Solidus's idea!
[0:41:53] <%krispen_wa> Minh ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:41:53] <+ChancellorOfLights> who wants to painstakingly mute the VOD whenever there's no dialogue?

[0:41:55] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> @Jathspuh Dude if V just went and redid the entire Arkham soundtrack that would be crazy.
[0:41:58] <MBDiana1> WB: "it's simple, we takedown the video"
[0:42:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> any batman game that doesn't have dmca music?
[0:42:00] <%Stupid121v2> Youtube literally trying to fuck non american creators rn
[0:42:01] <%rottingpastry> Minh, strip the music
[0:42:02] <Asuterisuku> @FrostedZaibatsu There's mixing in the game, but Woolie can't stand playing without the music and I don't blame him.
[0:42:03] <VidulaSaix> @CaptainBright It would be, but he is an editor. Sometimes you just gotta bite the bullet and do an irritating job because of stupid restrictions
[0:42:06] <+Deekman> @Superdandy96 just got the email for my channel a couple hours ago
[0:42:09] <%X2Eliah> @FrostedZaibatsu Theres almost no games that would let you pipe voice and sfx to one audio interface and music to another audio interface
[0:42:10] <%jmpeil> Pop Yakuza 0
[0:42:10] <+RiverKing13> dispute the claim
[0:42:13] <Hawkbone_> The majority of this games value now thats its old is the atmosphere tbh, saying that as someone who beat this game 10 times
[0:42:13] <brunoberserk> SUMMON THE DOKAGE
[0:42:14] <Equirah> Hey Minh, want to mix 8 tracks? LUL
[0:42:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Would pitch shifting the audio actually work?
[0:42:17] <BreakersAweigh> reggie's hair is looking pretty vergil today
[0:42:17] <leith_aziz> Is DCAU music DMCA free ?
[0:42:19] <%orcstr16> Ok hear me out. What if....we mute it on youtube, BUT have reggie score it in post. Just turn the youtube version into a shitpost (not a real solution too much work, but imagine)
[0:42:19] <TheWizardOfWordplay> play bloodborne music
[0:42:20] <%emperordread> Minh to win woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX

[0:42:26] <+LeaIsChill> Has Woolie begun the coup of WB?

[0:44:37] <Mr_Rakjo> Gladiator
[0:44:37] <benjiFG> anime
[0:44:37] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus : I remember a comment translating something ASW said in the I-No/Anji gameplay reveal. They said that they might make inputs LESS lenient to make the game harder. I dont think this is a good change in my opinion.

[0:44:58] <+nabs2099> lol that's kinda lame
[0:44:58] <dundore77> Xmen powers are also relevant to how they are emotionally.
[0:45:01] <some_brave_apollo> Captain Britain is also similar
[0:45:02] <D3rrtyD4n> just call his peepee small and he's done
[0:45:02] <+allups> The Gladiator, has a badass mohawk
[0:45:05] <+RiverKing13> Not Sentry
[0:45:06] <enerkaizer> The 436th attempt fro Marvel to have a Superman counterpart

[0:45:10] <picanoturna> big anime trope
[0:45:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's Gladiator is from the Shiar Empire, if he's confident in himself, he is STRONGER and dangerous

[0:45:33] <nimu290> its gald
[0:45:33] <%jmpeil> Sentry has the power of schizophrenia
[0:45:33] <%Superdandy96> Sentry is Superman with more mental issues
[0:45:34] <azreal30> Favorite book?
[0:45:35] <%orcstr16> What are your thoughts on patreon Woolz? It has its own problems, but it could help with situations like this by allowing you to not worry about youtube monetization for income.
[0:45:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you break GL's will, he loses his ability to control the ring
[0:45:36] <%wibbwobbler> will power, believe in yourself
[0:45:37] <MBDiana1> Does Sentry say "Dattebayo"?
[0:45:42] <+nabs2099> Are black lanterns powered by their hatred for women?
[0:45:47] <%LastHazzerd> Every Lantern is an emotional trait
[0:45:48] <%Dante_Namikaze1> yes Green lantern's power come from willpower but if you have no confidence in your ability all the constructs will be garbage and easily broken

[0:49:42] <DSD24> Hit the deck!
[0:49:44] <iLike_femboys> this makes you FEEEL like batman
[0:49:44] <%saladin1911> Shit, Batman tanked that shit LUL

[0:49:57] <sunnythedrunk> It takes 5 sniper bullets to kill the bat LUL
[0:49:57] <peachy996> It's annoying but sometimes you can't help it
[0:49:57] <TallPixels> no fall damage btw
[0:49:58] <+Deekman> Is there a mod to calm down bat vision?
[0:50:00] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you're going to love smoke pellets
[0:50:02] <%Superdandy96> The only time it worked was White Knight and it‚Äôs a hoot! Would strongly recommend to read
[0:50:03] <leith_aziz> Im not the one that can judge, but why dont the authority just take care of Joker after the shit he pulls ? It shouldnt be Batman that has to consider executing him
[0:50:04] <Asuterisuku> Detective vision is OP, we wouldn't blame you.
[0:50:09] <D3rrtyD4n> i only played this game in bat vision. definitely ruins that game. LUL

[0:50:13] <NoireRequiem> LEDGE TAKEDOWN?
[0:50:14] <BlackermanZX> fuck that keep it on if you need it
[0:50:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can do a pull takedown from underneath MFs
[0:50:15] <Blank9> never gonna play through all of mgs4 with the solid eye night vision on
[0:50:17] <Monkey_D_Judd> its not nearly as bad as otsd
[0:50:22] <leith_aziz> @Hawkbone_: I meant the art
[0:50:24] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus if this games makes you feel like batman then reggie is feeling like robin?
[0:50:25] <%orcstr16> @Ravioli_Ronin I want to believe that's not real, but, knowing comics, it almost certainly is.
[0:50:26] <%krispen_wa> @leith_aziz because DC needs joker alive to make money
[0:50:27] <%saladin1911> Are ledge takedowns a thing in this one?
[0:50:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yeah, the Ledge Takedown
[0:50:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe an upgrade?

[0:50:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you leap over and drag down MFs
[0:50:47] <NoireRequiem> @saladin1911 i'm not sure, maybe an upgrade?
[0:50:49] <NeoseekerStitch> no
[0:50:52] <iLike_femboys> nope
[0:50:52] <@akuda_bar> Cheer500 doing my part to re-monetize the video
[0:50:53] <+Damie904> nope
[0:50:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and leave them hanging
[0:50:54] <GilliamYaeger> It is super duper tempting to have Detective Mode on 24/7 and I think a lot of people have played through these games with it on for 90% of the time
[0:51:01] <%Javaa01> I think they only respawn when you make story progress
[0:51:05] <chainsaw105> bad news, I added too much cheese to my nachos now there's a lot left over
[0:51:06] <%rottingpastry> Respawning would mean infinite xp. This isn't that kind of game.
[0:51:06] <peachy996> Surprised they never do.
[0:51:11] <Ravioli_Ronin> @orcstr16 wait till I tell you about the other Xenomorphs based on the rest of Batman‚Äôs villains

[0:52:17] <+CptBritches> lmao
[0:52:17] <enerkaizer> curling is fun the moment you know what the tricks are. Then it becomes a game similiar to gang beasts
[0:52:18] <arkv01> reggie...
[0:52:19] <%saladin1911> I literally don't even know what that is. That a sport?
[0:52:22] <MyNameIsRasus> I am a Brazillian so I will never be able to play curling tho
[0:52:23] <+allups> is that the one with the ice
[0:52:24] <Ravioli_Ronin> They lube up the curling rocks with maple syrup
[0:52:24] <@Solidus_113> remember not to mash
[0:52:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus I too enjoy competitive broom sweeping
[0:52:36] <iLike_femboys> everytime you smash jason todd gets a crowbar to the face
[0:52:37] <Asuterisuku> The mash is real.
[0:52:40] <casualshinji> Knife dudes fuck up the combat flow so hard.
[0:52:43] <%mundanelotus> rhythm
[0:52:43] <%rottingpastry> mashing bad
[0:52:44] <Hawkbone_> Time to button mash
[0:52:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> does this game have the Leap Over them after a stun move?
[0:52:47] <AxelCezar> bitterDab bitterDab
[0:52:47] <enerkaizer> There is btw a Non-ice version of curling, too. The use wheels for this

[0:52:51] <peachy996> Remember you can Cape Stun and Jump over goons with X

[0:52:56] <Hawkbone_> OOPS! All Dropped Combos!
[0:53:01] <peachy996> Jus to give yourself more time to think
[0:53:01] <SpartanDumpster> Curling seems like one of those things I'd want to play one or two rounds of, but not finish a whole match.
[0:53:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cape stun can do a bunch of things
[0:53:06] <slix3431> Wiff
[0:53:07] <DSD24> Punch those toes
[0:53:08] <%Mkingston> OK batman

[0:53:16] <%paladinstarbuster> Cant combo if mash
[0:53:16] <%X2Eliah> Yeah this is not a button masher, this is a rhythm game
[0:53:18] <jaysondeez> does stun extended the combo right now or is that an upgrade?
[0:53:19] <TheWizardOfWordplay> should've done some challenge maps
[0:53:20] <+TheyCallMeVawn> HIS PUNCH HAS AN AOE

[0:53:23] <%Superdandy96> My toes!!
[0:53:23] <Ravioli_Ronin> Batman doesn‚Äôt murder, but he‚Äôs 100% indirectly killing some people
[0:53:23] <GilliamYaeger> hitboxes
[0:53:25] <slix3431> He hit him with his sigma energy
[0:53:25] <stardustcrusad3r> this fighting still looks cool and was sick when it was new, fuck "makes you feel like" haters
[0:53:26] <chainsaw105> com-BAT
[0:53:26] <%superc37> god this combat aged poorly
[0:53:27] <+Tuffty> So good he hits you with the moves you don't see
[0:53:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it is totally a rhythm game
[0:53:32] <%NorthGrizzly> it does more harm than good.
[0:53:34] <leith_aziz> Give Woolie some time, he'll get better
[0:53:39] <%rottingpastry> Getting good at the combat is so much fun
[0:53:42] <%Seancicle> reading your lips
[0:53:43] <casualshinji> It was the air current of his fits that did it.
[0:53:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ledge takedown
[0:53:49] <%NorthGrizzly> it does not let you mash
[0:53:50] <Hawkbone_> It lets you mash in the same way DMC lets you mash
[0:53:55] <%saladin1911> Chat, why are ALL of these inmates barefoot? Quincy Sharpe telling us something?
[0:53:56] <%X2Eliah> PULL HIM DOWN
[0:53:56] <Johannen> Its not a fighting game to punish you for mashing)
[0:53:56] <%rottingpastry> why not to mash: better combo scores = more xp
[0:53:57] <BigBlackBankai> sonic punch
[0:53:58] <CaptainBright> Ledge takedowns exist
[0:54:15] <chainsaw105> snipers looking like the sniper drones from Gears
[0:54:20] <+Count_Graagh> You can ledge takedown
[0:54:21] <Asuterisuku> You can interrupt a silent takedown to bring them down more quickly in exchange for making noise.
[0:54:25] <%Superdandy96> Combat‚Äôs kinda like a rhythm game right?
[0:54:26] <Depthcharge2030> its like a thing in psycj wards where patients arent allowed shoes....or shoe laces
[0:54:36] <leith_aziz> Im guessing inmates in real-life DO wear shoes ? Otherwise that would be weirtd
[0:54:37] <SpartanDumpster> I actually hate hearing people criticize the combat like "you can just mash Y to win" cause it's like "put in some effort to have fun!"
[0:54:38] <leith_aziz> Weird
[0:54:39] <peachy996> Asylum is so weird to return to because the mechanics get better with each game
[0:54:42] <iLike_femboys> adumSociety
[0:54:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when Woolie discovers the Ledge Takedown, his world will change forever
[0:54:47] <MyNameIsRasus> PERSONA!!!
[0:54:51] <%X2Eliah> Combat is almost like a fighting game, i.e. you have to press your inputs with intent
[0:54:51] <Jashter18> Joker is NOT a good boss
[0:54:56] <NoireRequiem> persona moment
[0:54:56] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie forgot when Joker crippled that guys wife last sessions
[0:54:57] <Darren716> You blame him? Persona's are rad
[0:54:57] <%LastHazzerd> WB
[0:54:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> When you think about it, real life is just one long rhythm game
[0:54:59] <%Mkingston> When word gets round that Batman never kills. Do people stop being afraid of him?
[0:55:08] <%rottingpastry> @SpartanDumpster Then you play on the mode where there's no counter indicator lol
[0:55:10] <+allups> doesn't he like kill henchmen all the time
[0:55:15] <%saladin1911> @depthcharge2030 I'd assume they can just wear the soft slip on pumps tho right?
[0:55:19] <%krispen_wa> He still hurts you a lot
[0:55:19] <dinnydanny777> I wonder if Joker pays his goons more than $15 an hour
[0:55:21] <%RyTYoung> @allups yup
[0:55:23] <%SainEdge> monkaS
[0:55:27] <%X2Eliah> @Mkingston Batman does a whole lot of grievous bodily harm
[0:55:30] <Hawkbone_> @Mkingston "Fall from this height wouldn't kill me" "I'm counting on it."
[0:55:33] <%Stupid121v2> @Mkingston yeah half the jokers bit is he knows batman wont do shit to him so he keeps going

[0:57:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea you dead
[0:57:15] <+GenesisKnight> Semi-blind
[0:57:17] <DingusMcBaseball> only 90% blind
[0:57:18] <SpartanDumpster> @rottingpastry I mean like Dunkey's video on these games where he's literally pressing Y over and over. It's like expecting to turn the game on, put the controller on the floor like "ok game, be fun!"
[0:57:18] <%krispen_wa> LUL LUL
[0:57:21] <+skyheys> SHOT IN THE FACE
[0:57:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> not worth it if the other guy notices
[0:57:23] <casualshinji> Well, they are looking through scopes afterall.
[0:57:32] <dinnydanny777> Henchmen can't look straight down, they are like the inverse of dogs
[0:57:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it is loud if people are around since they are screaming in terror
[0:57:36] <+allups> that grip tho
[0:57:41] <+EdenOfLove> is it just me or is joker's voice real quiet?
[0:57:44] <MyNameIsRasus> gorilla grip batman
[0:57:47] <Darren716> I mean he can't do anything like that
[0:57:47] <%butthurtsupport> butthurtsupport subscribed with Prime.
[0:57:50] <%emperordread> spooked unconscious
[0:57:50] <Asuterisuku> Luckily he dropped his gun.
[0:57:51] <$StaceMcGate> after 20 minutes, all the blood will go to his head
[0:57:52] <%ChoculaUltra> all the blood just rushing to his head
[0:57:52] <%Noonoox12> @EdenOfLove the game is
[0:57:54] <dundore77> really that one guy just gave up. you can get out of that
[0:57:56] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus his blood will soon get to his head and died
[0:57:57] <+allups> to get shot in the face and not even lose grip what agod
[0:57:58] <$emptyantics> monkas
[0:58:01] <sunnythedrunk> He will probably die eventually
[0:58:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there is a thing wehre you can cut the ropes of any hanging enemy and drop them on another enemy
[0:58:06] <dinnydanny777> Hung upside down like those guys in Bloodborne
[0:58:08] <casualshinji> Batman has that special elven rope.
[0:58:09] <+EdenOfLove> no but like it's just Joker, not the rest of the game
[0:58:16] <%rottingpastry> @SpartanDumpster Yes, and tbh dunkey is pretty bad at video games
[0:58:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it knocks out both
[0:58:17] <slix3431> Vent above

[0:59:09] <%X2Eliah> Oh no Woolz stuck
[0:59:10] <NoireRequiem> i remember reading some bs about how batman knows how many teeth he'll knock out or the severity of concussion dealt from his punches - which is bs but I believe it
[0:59:10] <Asuterisuku> Listen to these guys talkin' shit at the BAT.
[0:59:14] <%orcstr16> I love these goons. They're so full of themselves.

[0:59:32] <mankeymania> worth it
[0:59:33] <+geminitengu> this isent warframe
[0:59:34] <%orcstr16> The music is A++ atmosphere.
[0:59:35] <+DomunDomunDomun> I think there was a door up where the snipers were.
[0:59:36] <leith_aziz> It hurts when its so good,.....

[0:59:55] <Asuterisuku> @IronChefWookie Kazama's Backstory LUL
[0:59:56] <+ChancellorOfLights> gonna be real awkward when they're commenting over muted audio
[1:00:00] <leith_aziz> Music is really good for atmosphere. Its the most unique in the franchise
[1:00:05] <VidulaSaix> They're not muting the audio
[1:00:10] <chainsaw105> don't forget Woolie you got an item last time that lets you pull vents off walls
[1:00:10] <%chosenjuan42> Get in from outside. Its not super clear
[1:00:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> I hope when Woolie talks about the game on the podcast when they're done that he brings up the music first in how good it is LUL
[1:00:13] <+noajenkk> anime watchers are fools
[1:00:14] <snakest3alth> Outside
[1:00:14] <iLike_femboys> lol wollie always uses a batarang as an answer
[1:00:14] <%krispen_wa> Blow up the force field
[1:00:15] <+panlakes> yeah it's hard being a youtube user these days
[1:00:19] <SpartanDumpster> Just spray some explosive gel on the dead guy LUL
[1:00:20] <Ravioli_Ronin> Go go gadget batterang
[1:00:21] <%cursedwithadhd> then why even put on youtube those episodes were terrible with the long stretches of silence
[1:00:21] <+panlakes> twitch or be kil, basically
[1:00:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> "why is Batman coming in through the front door?"
[1:00:23] <%ChoculaUltra> this is Batman's planning time in real time
[1:00:23] <%emperordread> USE gel ON guard Kappa
[1:00:26] <%X2Eliah> I give it 5 minutes
[1:00:26] <peachy996> Time to leave
[1:00:29] <%rottingpastry> Batarang is often the answer in these games
[1:00:31] <%Javaa01> A different door is required
[1:00:33] <NewWillinium> If only Bruce wasn't so goddamn Beefy he could fit through those Window Panes
[1:00:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh GREAT. A GRATE.
[1:00:36] <%NorthGrizzly> VENT
[1:00:38] <mankeymania> walk outside
[1:00:39] <+ChancellorOfLights> Use the portal gun
[1:00:40] <BlackermanZX> Batarang IS usually a good answer though LUL
[1:00:41] <casualshinji> Shinji Ikari yourself through the forcefield.

[1:00:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not a spoiler if it's obvious
[1:00:55] <mr_saturday93> Oh god is woolie having a big brain moment t rn
[1:00:56] <slix3431> Do it coward
[1:00:56] <leith_aziz> He'll figure it out guys
[1:00:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> You'll figure it out
[1:00:58] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> not unless you're a pillar men
[1:00:58] <puluxor> If you hold A when grappling you'll climb up automatically
[1:00:59] <+allups> batman is known for using the front door
[1:00:59] <%krispen_wa> JUST SHRINK
[1:01:06] <%mundanelotus> just phase through ez

[1:01:10] <+heyitsdenzel_> use batman teleportation power
[1:01:11] <Asuterisuku> Woolie will figure it out. In the meantime we will just watch.
[1:01:14] <brunoberserk> batman will figure out
[1:01:16] <%Jiggisnipe> Woolie Will Figure It Out
[1:01:16] <peachy996> Lol this is going to be an LP where Chat has to be VERY patient and let Woolie figure it out
[1:01:16] <iLike_femboys> use your bat shrink ray
[1:01:19] <+CptBritches> Dundundundun
[1:01:19] <%ChoculaUltra> turn it from wumbo to minimize, obv Kappa
[1:01:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> oh that answer to the riddle Woolie already found
[1:01:22] <Lancaster_H> front door is front door, but batman is not a front door man
[1:01:23] <%X2Eliah> Status: DECEASED on that hanging dude
[1:01:24] <%Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[1:01:25] <dinnydanny777> Was that hanging guy Deceased?

[1:01:41] <+noajenkk> 4Head
[1:01:41] <+CptBritches> Gotcha
[1:01:43] <%Jiggisnipe> that scene was nice tho
[1:01:43] <+ChancellorOfLights> that line has unironically inspired me for years
[1:01:48] <Torgue_1> Jebaited Jebaited
[1:01:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they do hide treasure the wrong direction in RPG
[1:01:52] <%orcstr16> It was a good scene tho

[1:02:00] <+nabs2099> @chancelloroflights what line? I missed it
[1:02:01] <leith_aziz> An interesting detail is that this is the only game (apparently) in the series where you can see enemies breathing physically when uncounsious
[1:02:07] <%Seancicle> they deserve to live Woolie
[1:02:09] <+ChancellorOfLights> There's always another way in
[1:02:13] <%krispen_wa> so does batman ever think about how every time he lets joker go, joker creates thousands of traumatized bruce waynes like him? is this how batman recruits his Robins
[1:02:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but yeah, Woolie totally found the coffin of Amadeus Arkham already
[1:02:32] <%mundanelotus> woolieMIRIN
[1:02:34] <%bearwagon> LUL
[1:02:35] <+nabs2099> @chancelloroflights thanks!
[1:02:36] <peachy996> Remember when Two-Face killed Robin's parents
[1:02:38] <NewWillinium> Joker has newer messages the further you go into the game right? It sounds like we've already run the gamut
[1:02:43] <peachy996> That was weird
[1:02:43] <%chosenjuan42> You have passed the vent earlier before going inside
[1:02:44] <casualshinji> What if there weren't any vents though? Gotham'd be fucked.

[1:04:20] <alexyaoilover> This game was made for average consumer...
[1:04:20] <Goraka91> Really it's not Batman's fault the legal system hasn't given Joker the death sentence

[1:04:32] <Hawkbone_> Oh man, can't wait to hear the same 4 Joker lines over and over because the devs didn't think the player could take this long to get to the mansion

[1:04:57] <$emptyantics> yoooo
[1:04:59] <daswampken> Hardest riddle so far
[1:05:00] <Mangahero18> I know its just a game thing and im supposed to 'not think about it' but how the HELL did Riddler sneak into Arkham and place a whole bunch of those little plastic trophies all around the Asylum? Like, behind walls and in vents and in the caves and shit. Did he hire someone? Did he go around crawling in Vents an Spelunking?
[1:05:01] <Asuterisuku> There might be something in the graveyard
[1:05:02] <%Noonoox12> Dig Up
[1:05:02] <+alexotic0> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:05:06] <peachy996> @Hawkbone_ To be fair the game is giving him a bunch of hints to figure it out
[1:05:06] <%Superdandy96> Woolz playing like I did when I first played it lol. He‚Äôs got this
[1:05:09] <iLike_femboys> just make your own grave
[1:05:10] <thefranchise00> I remember this took me awhile to find on my first playthrough too
[1:05:12] <TurranosOrn> sometimes u just gotta use detectvies vision
[1:05:13] <guts32> Jesus christ Woolie you saw the thing and ignored it
[1:05:14] <%X2Eliah> The farther you go the more correct you are, you know
[1:05:14] <Hawkbone_> WORLDS GREATEST DETECTIVE
[1:05:19] <+taggerung403> only 4 pairs of eyes
[1:05:21] <Lancaster_H> any holes a goal
[1:05:26] <%kullumanati> For Woolies battle with Twitch demons! Gifts for subs.
[1:05:27] <+allups> check the sniper spot again?
[1:05:27] <Adamisfruit> Maybe look for the high point on the building to take a look around
[1:05:28] <iLike_femboys> this is how the batman died
[1:05:28] <anAngryHamster> DarksydeWoolie
[1:05:29] <pontain_pirate> @Mangahero18 he has henchmens
[1:05:35] <+allups> they had to get up ther some how
[1:05:35] <Robot_Nixon_> @Mangahero18 he's got a lot of free time on his hands atpRtsd
[1:05:38] <VidulaSaix> Imagine how awkward this would be with no music LUL
[1:05:41] <%The_Mcmuffin> @kullumanati oh my, thank you <3
[1:05:42] <GilliamYaeger> @Mangahero18 He probably asked Joker to do it and/or placed them there himself during his own stints in Arkham.
[1:05:43] <guts32> He saw the "door" and ignored it
[1:05:44] <%cursedwithadhd> this is torture but this is how you learn
[1:05:47] <Reckless_Rob> This brings back the good memories
[1:05:47] <@akuda_bar> imagine being a henchman and watching batman just hustle around on the grass looking confused
[1:05:48] <NoireRequiem> we just gotta believe in woolie
[1:05:54] <Asuterisuku> Sometimes you just have to make some space and look at the bigger picture.
[1:05:54] <%phd_in_thuggery> big ups, woolie
[1:05:57] <Goraka91> Some say he is still there to this day
[1:05:57] <Jashter18> @mangahero18 I fully believe Riddler would've planted some on trips to Arkham himself or with the use of henchman becaude Nigma is NOTHING if not extra as ASF
[1:05:58] <BlackermanZX> if you are searching for an entrance in this game ts always very close
[1:05:58] <+applemon198> UP
[1:05:58] <%shad8snake> warmer
[1:05:58] <leith_aziz> @Mangahero18: In later games he has people put them where they are so maybe its the same thing here ?
[1:05:59] <ScrumDyna> @Mangahero18 I always assumed he just did it while locked up, waiting for something big like Joker's plan to go down to mess with Batman.
[1:06:00] <Darren716> Dig up
[1:06:00] <Lancaster_H> @akuda_bar thats a smart henchman

[1:07:50] <brian_peppers1> no OTG in this game btw
[1:07:51] <@akuda_bar> imagine punching batman
[1:07:51] <%RyTYoung> No imagine this without music LUL
[1:07:54] <Frodiddly> subtle tutorial about how the thugs can get guns in fist fights
[1:07:58] <guts32> Don't spam attacks woolie it just you miss and break combos
[1:07:59] <%RyTYoung> now*
[1:08:07] <Goraka91> Multiple fractures detected
[1:08:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> I like that some of the hit sound effects are super limp smack sounds
[1:08:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> *slap*
[1:08:13] <%wibbwobbler> NOW TALK
[1:08:14] <+Mrhennybottle> you get bragging rights if you managed to hit Batman
[1:08:16] <%phd_in_thuggery> those ragdolls tho
[1:08:17] <%mundanelotus> was it this game or the next that let you combo directly into floor takedown\
[1:08:18] <anAngryHamster> Insert sweaty guy mashing keys here
[1:08:19] <dinnydanny777> Batman do combo
[1:08:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @brian_peppers1 an OTG in this game would be the ground knockdown anyway
[1:08:26] <NoireRequiem> Crithit
[1:08:28] <+Story_Ark> eventually you get into the rhythm of it and can do more cool combos and special moves
[1:08:31] <VidulaSaix> Yeah if you mash in this game you basically neauter the combat
[1:08:33] <dinnydanny777> Do you think Batman is counting his combos?
[1:08:35] <%rottingpastry> use dodge to extend the combo
[1:08:36] <VidulaSaix> neuter*
[1:08:36] <Asuterisuku> It doesn't slow it down if you can consistently get that Just Timing.
[1:08:36] <%Superdandy96> This is why Batman doesn‚Äôt eat any of Alfred‚Äôs food before going out. He feels out of his norm Kappa
[1:08:36] <%aram909> using the cape doesnt break the combo, its like using the gun in DMC
[1:08:39] <Robot_Nixon_> backseating atpCap
[1:08:41] <%aram909> dodging also keeps the combo going
[1:08:44] <%rottingpastry> and also do critical strikes
[1:08:47] <NoireRequiem> @dinnydanny777 yes
[1:08:49] <%rottingpastry> for good combo
[1:08:50] <keyworthe> i'd like to think batman is build like a brick so thugs break their fists on him
[1:08:50] <alexyaoilover> Reggie should help Woolie fins the Arkham City easter egg
[1:08:56] <+YaBish311> Play it like a rhythm game

[1:09:14] <iLike_femboys> riddler is an xbox kid and i love it
[1:09:14] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[1:09:14] <+ChancellorOfLights> so close to level up
[1:09:18] <peachy996> The only thing that breaks a combo is if you strike at nothing or if you get hit
[1:09:18] <%Feralspirit41> Riddler is such an asshole
[1:09:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Salty Nigma is salty
[1:09:21] <Daxalog> Are the devs speaking through the riddler?
[1:09:24] <kulmoth> oh no
[1:09:25] <+PlatinumRevol> Riddler: I'm not owned I'm not owned!
[1:09:26] <Darren716> Why?
[1:09:27] <+CptBritches> Lmao
[1:09:29] <$priceyyeti40> Oh my God
[1:09:30] <Asuterisuku> Woolie, that's the door you came in.
[1:09:31] <%Ether101_Prime> This game was a rytham game at one point.
[1:09:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Wally Wingert is a really good Riddler VA
[1:09:31] <%phd_in_thuggery> lol
[1:09:32] <user_naim> Wait are we still doing music?
[1:09:33] <mesamus> woolie....

[1:09:36] <Goraka91> NotLikeThis
[1:09:37] <seniormeatbox> fast travel
[1:09:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> stuns and counters also add to combo
[1:09:38] <dundore77> Didn't woolie play the Shadow of Mordor game? Its an earlier version of that
[1:09:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> No you don't
[1:09:41] <%phd_in_thuggery> lmao
[1:09:41] <guts32> You press the hit button after hitting someone it's easier that way than to spam it
[1:09:42] <picanoturna> but its like that
[1:09:42] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus you can use ground takedowns to continue your combos if you time it right
[1:09:43] <keyworthe> LP TAX
[1:09:44] <Hawkbone_> The devs literally call it a rhythm game
[1:09:44] <%saladin1911> Chat, my wisdom tooth is fucking killing me :(
[1:09:44] <peachy996> Now THAT I've done before with the door
[1:09:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and dodging
[1:09:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> You hit attack at the right time and it finds someone to hit
[1:09:50] <GilliamYaeger> You need to punch people with rhythm.
[1:09:52] <%Pillagius> Woolie play it like a drums then - keep the beat cohhLUL
[1:09:52] <%Javaa01> You attack in a rhythm to get critical strikes to increase your combo meter faster and get instant takedowns
[1:09:53] <iLike_femboys> people give joker a lot of love and he deserves it but riddler is a gem in this games
[1:09:55] <RyanSmoothies> slap happy rhythm batman
[1:09:56] <Hawkbone_> Woolie doesn't understand critical strikes
[1:09:58] <+PikeBot> DOn't forget, you can dodge over enemies as many times as you want without dropping your combo.
[1:09:59] <%mundanelotus> reactive and proactive
[1:09:59] <%robo_trunk> Set a rythm and follow it
[1:09:59] <%doomerskeletor13> @saladin1911 Pull it out
[1:10:01] <+alexdavencs> It's still a rythm game, you need to time your attacks/dodges/counters to keep the combo going
[1:10:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> leap over dodge will be YOUR BEST FRIEND later
[1:10:03] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You get more exp based on both how high your combo is, and how many different things you do in it. It's somewhat like style system in the DMC games.
[1:10:04] <+0neReeler> keep rhythm to get multiplier up
[1:10:07] <leith_aziz> Think of it as a rythm game
[1:10:08] <iLike_femboys> batman's weakness is looking up
[1:10:08] <BlackermanZX> i remember countering being hella good
[1:10:09] <%phd_in_thuggery> when's the woolie getting lost emote?
[1:10:11] <+nabs2099> Is Woolie doing Sekiro tomorrow or Yakuza? Either way, we eatin GOOD
[1:10:12] <@akuda_bar> what does batman eat
[1:10:13] <+allups> bash X and hit Y some times
[1:10:20] <+YaBish311> Lmao didn‚Äôt think my comment would be a problem
[1:10:21] <%Ether101_Prime> Legend had it that this was a rhythm game originally.
[1:10:23] <%rottingpastry> Also batman will fly like halfway across a room to continue a combo as long as you point the stick at an enmy
[1:10:24] <iLike_femboys> @akuda_bar batfood duh
[1:10:24] <user_naim> @akuda_bar lobster bisque
[1:10:32] <TurranosOrn> big hint for this game, looking up never hurts
[1:10:36] <+Crippl3> hmmm pieThink
[1:10:38] <%X2Eliah> big dog energy
[1:10:39] <TallPixels> Look up lol
[1:10:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> later on, the game will literally tell you "leap over those guys or die"
[1:10:42] <guts32> blind
[1:10:44] <Jathspuh> keed the rhythm up, now go up, now go diagonal, now go up
[1:10:45] <+SolidusRex> Your must punch people with rhythm. No, seriously.
[1:10:45] <daswampken> Dammit riddler and his door puzzles

[1:10:48] <+allups> @akuda_bar Bats
[1:10:49] <$priceyyeti40> why never look up
[1:10:54] <kloj00> Oh man I spent so much time on this part
[1:10:54] <%X2Eliah> Is it canon now that Woolies cannot look up?
[1:10:57] <Lancaster_H> woolies cant look up
[1:10:57] <@akuda_bar> @allups oh ok
[1:10:58] <leith_aziz> Man I thought EXACTLY like Woolie
[1:11:00] <leith_aziz> Here
[1:11:05] <Asuterisuku> Light punch, Medium punch, Light Kick, Heavy Punch, Keep the rhythm up!
[1:11:10] <leith_aziz> The memories...
[1:11:12] <Johannen> Woolie is right, Rhythm games are more reactive while games with this combat are proactive, but there is a rhythm to it
[1:11:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Batman‚Äôs cowl won‚Äôt let him look upwards
[1:11:15] <%phd_in_thuggery> okay I legit have no clue where this is
[1:11:16] <+Story_Ark> next podcast: pat argues that woolies cant look up
[1:11:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Batman can't look up if his cowl is stiff
[1:11:18] <%SeedTabulous> Make sure that your DDR pad is calibrated
[1:11:21] <Allenou> What is this "up" you keep talking about ? Woolie only goes DOWN
[1:11:23] <+Mrhennybottle> Batman eats justice
[1:11:24] <@akuda_bar> dogs can't look up
[1:11:28] <NewWillinium> . . What kind of Architectural style is this place? Like. . . I actually genuinely like how it looks.
[1:11:32] <iLike_femboys> bats are blind
[1:11:32] <+el_hearto> Backseating rbzLul
[1:11:36] <%phd_in_thuggery> ahaaaaaaaa
[1:11:36] <Hawkbone_> Gothic
[1:11:40] <Torgue_1> Always look up
[1:11:40] <+NYCrownlessKing> batseatinf
[1:11:40] <seniormeatbox> HEAD INJURYT
[1:11:41] <+nabs2099> How many of you guys haven't played Arkham Asylum since it's launch? I replayed it last year myself.
[1:11:45] <%bearwagon> Keaton couldn't turn his neck while in the suit
[1:11:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> huzzah!
[1:11:46] <Yung_FckUp> Lp tAx gUyS
[1:11:50] <peachy996> This is a game that demands you look at the area
[1:11:51] <T_Sasquatch> you do have cheat vision
[1:11:51] <chainsaw105> to be fair that part of the ceiling was lit up
[1:11:54] <TallPixels> woolie would never see batman if he was hiding above him
[1:11:54] <%rottingpastry> splut splut
[1:11:56] <HollowMan190> wat was the solution?
[1:11:59] <dinnydanny777> @newwillinium Gothic maybe?
[1:12:00] <leith_aziz> @nabs2099: Played it and City last year
[1:12:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> to be honest, I haven't played Asylum since 2009
[1:12:03] <Lancaster_H> i fucking love that he draws a bat
[1:12:05] <+call_me_comic> bro nobody but you is gonna see that the gel is bat shaped
[1:12:06] <sunnythedrunk> Amadeus Amadeus
[1:12:06] <blackkanye> Just tank that explosion to the face
[1:12:08] <Asuterisuku> Hold the Detective Vision button.

[1:12:12] <%aram909> hold LB
[1:12:13] <Darren716> Hold lb
[1:12:14] <TurranosOrn> hold it down
[1:12:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I replayed Asylum last year. I feel like I do it every other year
[1:12:15] <@akuda_bar> how is it ok for him to stand right next to the blast gel without covering his ears
[1:12:19] <+NYCrownlessKing> why do bats hang upside down to look down but don't stand up straight to look up
[1:12:23] <user_naim> What did Woolie decide about the music?
[1:12:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I go back to City enough though
[1:12:25] <+Crippl3> Keystone City PogChamp
[1:12:26] <%Seancicle> Reggie, act like you got some sense
[1:12:26] <Reckless_Rob> Keystone?

[1:12:45] <%doomerskeletor13> ‚ÄúI heard about a guy named Freud‚Äù
[1:12:45] <Reckless_Rob> How do you even know that?
[1:12:47] <T_Sasquatch> lets be real, how many of us actualy look straight up when entering rooms
[1:12:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @akuda_bar hid ears are too angry to take hearing damage
[1:12:48] <enerkaizer> Wally Wests city if I remember correctly
[1:12:49] <%rottingpastry> So you had a bad day
[1:12:50] <dinnydanny777> that was cool
[1:12:50] <@akuda_bar> @Lancaster_H bats have sensitive ears though
[1:12:51] <HollowMan190> Wow
[1:12:52] <daswampken> Mo its not
[1:12:53] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus So most riddles are not worth it, but these arkham spirit ones are worth tracking down
[1:12:54] <Asuterisuku> Amadeus is a murderer!

[1:13:16] <+el_hearto> @NYCrownlessKing The original flash is Keystone
[1:13:16] <%SeedTabulous> woolieLORE
[1:13:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Keystone and Central City are both Flash cities
[1:13:18] <user_naim> @sunnythedrunk damn, that‚Äôs appreciated
[1:13:24] <Reckless_Rob> Arkham is a happy man :)
[1:13:24] <%aram909> @X2Eliah its best to do the riddler challenges for the xp, then once you unlock all the upgrades thats when you stop
[1:13:25] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Sounds like a curse, perhaps a bio-curse
[1:13:25] <%Chatterbox1991> same energy

[1:13:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Actual Darkest Dungeon

[1:13:37] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Keystone is the Wally West Flash's city

[1:13:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:13:54] <daswampken> Keystone is shazam
[1:13:54] <%rottingpastry> Jay Garrick and Wally West technically
[1:13:59] <Reckless_Rob> Hes such a good Joker
[1:14:00] <+AmanDotZip> the voice actors are fantastic in this game
[1:14:00] <%robo_trunk> BTW the Justice League totally exists in this universe
[1:14:02] <Asuterisuku> This room has so much sheets and documents floating around with PhysX on.
[1:14:03] <%Superdandy96> A Flash game would be really fun
[1:14:06] <TheWizardOfWordplay> faucet is shazam
[1:14:10] <+TenguGemini> hot take: this game is pretty good
[1:14:12] <Hawkbone_> LUL

[1:14:18] <%rottingpastry> Fawcett
[1:14:21] <+el_hearto> @enerkaizer Maybe not talk about that, I can't remember if the game goes over it or not.
[1:14:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Central is some Flashes' city, Keystone are other Flashes' and Green Lanterns' City
[1:14:24] <%rottingpastry> Because he was from Fawcett Comics
[1:14:24] <%X2Eliah> So this room i recall was a bit tricky
[1:14:24] <%Kaito_Cam> Kaito_Cam subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Hey 3 months let's go!
[1:14:25] <kulmoth> no weapons fight time
[1:14:26] <+OutOfJambread> Will Batman get the prize then?
[1:14:29] <user_naim> If Woolie is just gonna deal with the music stuff, that‚Äôs pretty cool for the audience. Thanks Wools
[1:14:29] <@Solidus_113> do fight yeah
[1:14:34] <+taggerung403> why do people even choose to hench for Joker anyway
[1:14:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> games why would a flash game suck? because then its only playable on websites Kappa
[1:14:36] <%robo_trunk> Thought Shazam was in Philly. He makes it Sunny
[1:14:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> ba dum tsh
[1:14:39] <NewWillinium> What city does Green Arrow operate out of?
[1:14:39] <dinnydanny777> Did that say 51 bpm?
[1:14:41] <Darren716> I mean they aren't armed at least
[1:14:42] <leith_aziz> I got lost here for some time. I remember
[1:14:43] <TurranosOrn> YOU'RE BATMAN
[1:14:43] <Reckless_Rob> End them.
[1:14:44] <+sevorai> fight fight fight fight
[1:14:46] <+MagiKestral> remember you have to hang underneath the gargoyle to do the takedown. they fix that in City
[1:14:46] <Jashter18> Git Gud is how
[1:14:47] <+Mrhennybottle> @NYCrownlessKing lytLEERY
[1:14:48] <+allups> one guy is alone

[1:14:50] <enerkaizer> @NewWillinium Star city
[1:14:50] <casualshinji> Fight, fight, fight!
[1:14:51] <T_Sasquatch> press triangle
[1:14:51] <GilliamYaeger> No guns, just beat the shit out of them
[1:14:52] <+Story_Ark> star city i think?
[1:14:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Star City is Green Arrow
[1:14:52] <picanoturna> do it
[1:14:54] <%SainEdge> batmans biggest secret: punching!
[1:14:54] <TheWizardOfWordplay> in the movie it's philly
[1:14:57] <Lancaster_H> too far down
[1:14:59] <+NYCrownlessKing> doodStare @mrhennybottle
[1:15:00] <+samuraiknack> Martha was a Kane, Arkham was Earth 1
[1:15:02] <NewWillinium> Got it got it. My thanks
[1:15:02] <kulmoth> its okay just fight them
[1:15:03] <%shad8snake> too far
[1:15:04] <%X2Eliah> tooo far ahead
[1:15:05] <Hawkbone_> I agree with the thug
[1:15:06] <CocoonMoon> @taggerung403 Yeah, I wonder... do you get payment or anything?
[1:15:06] <%aram909> no guns, so just fight em
[1:15:06] <AvroEltz> "This is stupid"
[1:15:10] <peachy996> Oh man I really hope Woolie participates in Asylum's Beatdown Hallway during the party
[1:15:12] <%X2Eliah> they gotta be straight under
[1:15:12] <+dranok_x> NOT ARMED FIGHT
[1:15:14] <+sevorai> fight fight fight, do big comboooo
[1:15:16] <%rottingpastry> no guns, punch them in the face
[1:15:17] <picanoturna> its the freaking bat
[1:15:18] <casualshinji> When it's unarmed dues it usually means go in and brawl.
[1:15:21] <peachy996> It's one of the best fights in the game
[1:15:21] <BlackermanZX> tha guy is dead
[1:15:23] <dinnydanny777> not dead
[1:15:24] <+Mrhennybottle> Give em the knuckle sandwich
[1:15:28] <%X2Eliah> btw you can peel these guys off from the sides
[1:15:28] <%Seancicle> üêä‚õ±‚òÄÔ∏è
[1:15:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah it‚Äôs usually only a stealth segment if all the goons have guns
[1:15:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @taggerung403 Jokey is a bit more less violent on purpose to his henchs than say PENGUIN or Two-Face, and Freeze... well, he's needs it be cold while you work for him
[1:15:40] <+Gohyakuen> Woolie "never counter" Madden
[1:15:41] <sunnythedrunk> A big part is just waiting to counter
[1:15:47] <%mundanelotus> proactive
[1:15:48] <T_Sasquatch> the fact counter interrupts everything is so funny
[1:15:48] <picanoturna> focus focus
[1:15:52] <peachy996> You'll get it
[1:15:56] <%Superdandy96> ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs gotta hurt!‚Äù
[1:15:58] <%chosenjuan42> prioritize counters
[1:16:01] <Asuterisuku> This is much trickier on Hard, where the attack indicators don't exist.
[1:16:02] <+ChancellorOfLights> Woolie refuses the rhythm
[1:16:02] <SpartanDumpster> Woolie and the legend of the dropped combo
[1:16:03] <%aram909> you have to keep the attack
[1:16:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I would rather work for Joker than Penguin
[1:16:04] <NoireRequiem> Trial by fire time
[1:16:04] <BlackermanZX> counter is pretty damn good in this game
[1:16:05] <iLike_femboys> see that? wollie is starting to feel like batman
[1:16:06] <%X2Eliah> COUNTER PRIORITY
[1:16:07] <kulmoth> counter > punching
[1:16:08] <%aram909> keep the rhythm going
[1:16:09] <daswampken> nah hes just stunned lol
[1:16:10] <+Story_Ark> once the combat in this game clicks, its super fun. once i got into the rhythm of the game you can do some crazy shit
[1:16:10] <VidulaSaix> Now you got it!
[1:16:10] <+el_hearto> Someone should tell woolie he can buffer the input of his counter while hitting someone
[1:16:11] <@akuda_bar> he's really feeling it
[1:16:12] <+YaBish311> Now you‚Äôre getting it
[1:16:13] <BlackermanZX> there ya go
[1:16:14] <%rottingpastry> he's learning
[1:16:15] <+0neReeler> like a rhythm
[1:16:15] <%krispen_wa> HE'S STARTING TO BELIEVE
[1:16:15] <+Mrhennybottle> yeaa now he feeling it
[1:16:16] <user_naim> Just hit people until you see a counter,
[1:16:17] <+sevorai> he's doing itttt
[1:16:18] <T_Sasquatch> it becomes prettyyy braindead once you get used to it
[1:16:18] <%doomerskeletor13> He‚Äôs beginning to believe
[1:16:18] <dinnydanny777> oof the leg limesYikes
[1:16:20] <Hawkbone_> HOLY SHIT HE DID A CRITICAL STRIKE
[1:16:22] <user_naim> Ooh there you go
[1:16:22] <+Gloom_Tangerine> You can throw batarang as a distraction to bring people close to you.
[1:16:23] <%shad8snake> hes evolving
[1:16:24] <TheWizardOfWordplay> swing swing roll drink swing
[1:16:29] <leith_aziz> @ShinobiPhoenix: Doesnt Penguin treat his goons best ? Atleast when they do well. Harvey is too 50/50
[1:16:29] <dinnydanny777> that guy ain't walking away limesYikes
[1:16:30] <Yung_FckUp> you can cancel a punch with counter
[1:16:31] <CocoonMoon> limesCorn
[1:16:32] <Hawkbone_> HE'S LEARNING
[1:16:34] <Asuterisuku> He's starting to understand the rhythm guys!
[1:16:35] <leith_aziz> The bonecrunch sound
[1:16:35] <NoireRequiem> Leg break is brutal
[1:16:36] <SheefEatsBeef> he's starting to believe
[1:16:36] <BlackermanZX> pretty much everytime you see blue you counter
[1:16:37] <Jashter18> Keep the rhythm up Woolie!
[1:16:37] <+Mr_Pylon> He's doing it!
[1:16:37] <peachy996> There you go
[1:16:38] <%X2Eliah> Always counter never get hit
[1:16:39] <VidulaSaix> The combat's sick when you really get it
[1:16:41] <+sevorai> yesssssir
[1:16:42] <%rottingpastry> now just gotta incorporate dodges
[1:16:43] <+Mrhennybottle> nice
[1:16:45] <+Story_Ark> theeeere we go
[1:16:45] <%Superdandy96> It‚Äôs almost like a... Rhythm game.. Kappa
[1:16:45] <%phd_in_thuggery> GOOOOOOD
[1:16:45] <binaryanomaly16> He's beginning to beieve
[1:16:46] <GilliamYaeger> By jove, I think he's got it!
[1:16:46] <picanoturna> hes getting it
[1:16:47] <leith_aziz> Getting better
[1:16:47] <splinter1619> dont forget you can use ground takedowns in battle
[1:16:48] <+YaBish311> No rhythm he says :P
[1:16:50] <+ChancellorOfLights> hes learning!
[1:16:50] <dinnydanny777> limesCorn
[1:16:50] <brachydios777> I love Arkham combat
[1:16:51] <%bearwagon> you can dodge to keep it going
[1:16:52] <%doomerskeletor13> The combat gets much faster in the later games
[1:16:52] <+Gohyakuen> it's almost like a combo
[1:16:52] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> If only it had a taunt to keep the combo going
[1:16:53] <NoireRequiem> Broken bone club
[1:16:55] <%MonsterEnvy> Remember rt + attack knocks guys out on the ground
[1:16:55] <Reckless_Rob> You can also double jump to extend the combo
[1:16:55] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You're slowly starting to get it.
[1:16:56] <mankeymania> it takes practice
[1:16:56] <Hawkbone_> Almostlike a rhythm
[1:16:58] <brunoberserk> he is learning
[1:16:59] <%X2Eliah> THIS ISNT MASHING POTATOES
[1:16:59] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> but Batman isn't a taunter
[1:16:59] <kulmoth> prioritize countering, and puch in between
[1:17:00] <%mundanelotus> Woolie will become a beast
[1:17:03] <%LastHazzerd> it's not DMC
[1:17:05] <T_Sasquatch> i remeber doing the combat challenges in origins. Man 60 hit combos with electric gloves
[1:17:06] <+Gohyakuen> yes
[1:17:07] <+sevorai> rhythmmmm
[1:17:07] <%chosenjuan42> Like if it was a rythm
[1:17:08] <TurranosOrn> YES
[1:17:08] <Johannen> You can prolong the combo by using dodges over guys and using your "guns"
[1:17:10] <%johnny_gogo> you can dodge too
[1:17:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @leith_aziz Cobbleppot frequently tortures his goons, jsut like Black Mask
[1:17:10] <Hawkbone_> Yes
[1:17:10] <TheWizardOfWordplay> spider-man combat is very forgiving in comparison
[1:17:11] <+admiral_of_crunch> You can dodge away to keep combo
[1:17:11] <TurranosOrn> ABSOLUTELY
[1:17:13] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus YES
[1:17:13] <+xmetalicdemonx> yes
[1:17:14] <Hawkbone_> Punch
[1:17:14] <+0neReeler> punch
[1:17:16] <@Solidus_113> punch
[1:17:16] <+Gohyakuen> attack
[1:17:16] <+TheyCallMeVawn> Its not that complicated
[1:17:16] <+YaBish311> Like a rhythm hmm
[1:17:16] <picanoturna> no its fine
[1:17:17] <+Story_Ark> attack
[1:17:17] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> go in!!!
[1:17:18] <iLike_femboys> the gameplay gets better at city
[1:17:18] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> throw a rang
[1:17:18] <%phd_in_thuggery> bap em
[1:17:18] <alexyaoilover> Punch
[1:17:19] <+Crippl3> It's not that complicated lol
[1:17:19] <+0neReeler> always punch
[1:17:20] <Dio_TR> it's not DMC
[1:17:20] <%rottingpastry> or dodge
[1:17:20] <TallPixels> you can vault over enemies and throw batarangs to continue a combo
[1:17:20] <anAngryHamster> Woolie stop trying to Galaxy Brain it
[1:17:20] <leith_aziz> I start jumping
[1:17:20] <%aram909> always go in
[1:17:20] <fancyghost> you can always just roll over enemies too
[1:17:21] <user_naim> punch
[1:17:21] <@akuda_bar> go in
[1:17:21] <peachy996> You can also jump over
[1:17:21] <Lancaster_H> you can cancel almost any of your attack animations with a counter as long as youre in range of the counter @WoolieVersus
[1:17:21] <guts32> IT's easy you press the punch button after punching someone and you keep that rhytm
[1:17:22] <brachydios777> FIGHTING GAMES
[1:17:22] <+Gohyakuen> just attack
[1:17:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You have more options than you think
[1:17:23] <%aram909> counter then punch
[1:17:24] <TurranosOrn> counter doesn't do much damage
[1:17:24] <alexyaoilover> Counter when counter
[1:17:25] <MechaBaphomet> you are way overthinking it
[1:17:25] <+ChancellorOfLights> counter cancels a punch so always prep a punch
[1:17:25] <picanoturna> never stop going in
[1:17:25] <splinter1619> if in doubt, dodge over an enemy
[1:17:25] <%RyTYoung> both
[1:17:26] <%Captain_Aham> get 1 attack, then see
[1:17:26] <CaptainBright> You go straight into punch; a counter can cancel an attack
[1:17:27] <%krispen_wa> Overthinking John's
[1:17:27] <+Iamdenril> waiting for counter loses your combo as well
[1:17:27] <casualshinji> Never wait for counters.
[1:17:27] <TurranosOrn> also
[1:17:27] <@akuda_bar> never stop going in
[1:17:28] <%NorthGrizzly> I don't get that at all
[1:17:28] <%mundanelotus> thats the point
[1:17:29] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Don't wait
[1:17:29] <+Damie904> You're over complicating it, just punch.
[1:17:29] <%chosenjuan42> if no counter icon go punch
[1:17:29] <Asuterisuku> IF indicator on screen THEN counter ELSE Punch
[1:17:30] <%Javaa01> Counter, Punch, Punch, Counter
[1:17:31] <TurranosOrn> gadgets for control
[1:17:31] <dundore77> start punching the counter will cancel the punch
[1:17:31] <+applemon198> aim stick to other enemy after counter
[1:17:32] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus if theres another counter you go for it, or dodge
[1:17:33] <+xmetalicdemonx> I believe you can cancel a punch into a counter
[1:17:33] <+sevorai> always punch
[1:17:34] <VidulaSaix> Big Overthink again
[1:17:34] <guts32> YOU CAN COUNTER WHILE ATTACKING
[1:17:35] <%aram909> there arent too many options the way there are in Platinum games
[1:17:35] <+Mr_Pylon> there's some tech here
[1:17:35] <peachy996> Jumping over a goon helps this issue
[1:17:36] <%orcstr16> You can use a gadget in that timeframe as a buffer. Either batarang to keep someone at bay or claw to get someone to you
[1:17:36] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus depends on the distence between you and the attacker vs you and the goon further away
[1:17:36] <+admiral_of_crunch> There're more options than punch and counter. Other options can keep your combo up
[1:17:37] <iLike_femboys> do what batman would do
[1:17:39] <%NorthGrizzly> you have options
[1:17:41] <NoireRequiem> I always point the stick in the direction of the crowd not about to punch
[1:17:42] <%robo_trunk> jump over dude to give yourself a second. It keeps the combo but lets you think.
[1:17:42] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @WoolieVersus you can use an evasive dive (double tap A) to stall while you make a decision
[1:17:43] <TurranosOrn> BATARANG FOOLS TOO
[1:17:43] <%Dante_Namikaze1> yes go into punching
[1:17:43] <Hawkbone_> You can counter cancel
[1:17:44] <VidulaSaix> You can counter mid attack just fine
[1:17:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Don't wait for counter
[1:17:46] <user_naim> punch after counter, always
[1:17:46] <+JacknZack27> You can also mix in your gadgets and baterangs to give you more time
[1:17:47] <T_Sasquatch> you literally react to the counter , thats it. once you see the counter symbol you ocunter
[1:17:48] <GilliamYaeger> You can ALWAYS animation cancel into counters
[1:17:48] <+el_hearto> You can buffer input a counter while punching
[1:17:50] <+Story_Ark> not to mention using gadgets mid fight
[1:17:50] <+SolidusRex> PUNCH THE GOONS FOR GODSAKE
[1:17:52] <+NYCrownlessKing> always commit to punch then see what happens @woolieversus
[1:17:54] <dinnydanny777> I think Batarang is quite strong
[1:17:54] <%phd_in_thuggery> batarang after counters
[1:17:56] <%saladin1911> @woolieversus The answer is BATARANG
[1:17:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Always attack, counter when it pops up
[1:17:58] <%rottingpastry> Well, almost always animation cancel
[1:17:59] <$priceyyeti40> Think of a counter as canceling an attack.
[1:17:59] <%chosenjuan42> you can cancel into counter
[1:18:00] <J2m0ftw> You'll get better at it
[1:18:00] <BlackermanZX> counter whenever you can @WoolieVersus
[1:18:00] <leith_aziz> @xmetalicdemonx: Nope. The punch has to hit
[1:18:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Penguin is so "high society" that merely being made to look bad is acting to get tortured of your family hurt
[1:18:01] <NoireRequiem> All tools can be used in combat too
[1:18:01] <guts32> YOU CAN COUNTER WHILE ATTACKING!!
[1:18:01] <brachydios777> Arkham Knight definitely had the best evolution of this combat
[1:18:03] <BigBlackBankai> Counter cancels anything else.
[1:18:04] <+zepelinnn1> you can punch and then reaction counter
[1:18:04] <brunoberserk> you can use gadget in the combos
[1:18:06] <Darren716> I forget does Asylum have the quick gadgets during fights?
[1:18:10] <TurranosOrn> When you have a lot of enemies don't forget you can use your gadgets for CC
[1:18:12] <peachy996> Woolie needs to learn what the X button does in fights
[1:18:13] <Darren716> Like the gel dodge
[1:18:15] <@Solidus_113> yes boost
[1:18:16] <BlackermanZX> Remote Batarang is sick
[1:18:16] <+Crippl3> It's incredible complicated, you can either "punch" or "punch differently"
[1:18:17] <Hawkbone_> If anybody ever says Arkham is too simple, show them this
[1:18:18] <@Solidus_113> free takedowns
[1:18:18] <+Story_Ark> i think asylum has quick gadgets
[1:18:19] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah you can buffer the counter while attacking
[1:18:19] <%mundanelotus> Basically don't really on counters to fight
[1:18:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> asking to get tortured or your family hurt
[1:18:23] <peachy996> Or how to jump over a goon
[1:18:23] <+xmetalicdemonx> @leith_aziz thanks its been a while since I played these games
[1:18:26] <%kullumanati> Miles morales and Spider-Man do these better but they came after so yeah.
[1:18:28] <%rottingpastry> @Darren716 I think they tend to be upgrades in this one
[1:18:30] <VidulaSaix> Might be time for HP
[1:18:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Despite some of my problems with the game, Arkham Knight combat is so good
[1:18:33] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @Darren716 it does, but they are very basic
[1:18:36] <Doctadaking> Quick Gadgets weren't very useful in combat until City
[1:18:37] <Lancaster_H> @Darren716 i dont remember the gel but the batarang and grappel is there
[1:18:41] <+DizzyGunner> the baterang upgrades are amaing
[1:18:41] <Asuterisuku> You can use all your gadgets in combat too for different moves and twists.
[1:18:42] <SpartanDumpster> Also realize when almost no one is left. That last guy was on the ground, so you could've done a ground takedown instead of waiting.
[1:18:45] <casualshinji> The batarang and combo boost are both great.
[1:18:47] <BlackermanZX> remote control batarang is dumb fun though
[1:18:51] <+allups> jumping over goons in super useful and fun
[1:18:52] <+Gohyakuen> in city the gel is amazing
[1:18:56] <%X2Eliah> The battle system for this game is actually really complicated and nuanced, it's based on "if see counter icon, press counter button"
[1:18:59] <%BestTeaMaker> batman with the timbs
[1:18:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ngl I loved setting up explosions as traps for big groups
[1:19:00] <+allups> is*
[1:19:00] <+Story_Ark> i actually like the arkham combat more than spiderman. its more fun to use gadgets here than in spiderman
[1:19:12] <iLike_femboys> i only used the gadgets in asylum because of achievements and challenges
[1:19:17] <chainsaw105> was it City that had the combat gel attack or is that in this too?
[1:19:19] <@Solidus_113> This is the room with the secret breakable wall, right?
[1:19:19] <+fugatlas> in spiderman you kinda just get the push web and then why bother
[1:19:29] <iLike_femboys> @Solidus_113 thats at the wardens office
[1:19:39] <%saladin1911> @story_ark Naaaah. The Spider-Man combat gets insane and I love it
[1:19:40] <%HollowedIdjit> You bother for style points
[1:19:43] <Reckless_Rob> Theres a push web?
[1:19:45] <+GenesisKnight> Snailman Snail Asylum
[1:19:49] <%rottingpastry> the invisible breakable wall is in the office
[1:19:49] <%bearwagon> LUL
[1:19:50] <%aram909> riddler slows down the shittalking because hes gettin nervous
[1:19:51] <+0neReeler> didn't even bother
[1:19:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> Woolie tenses up everytime he grabs a riddler trophy
[1:19:53] <+ChancellorOfLights> you guys are forgetting that hard mode exists where counter icons are hidden
[1:19:57] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah the Impact web makes spiderman combat pretty eas
[1:19:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Did Woolie remove the Riddler from the sound files
[1:19:58] <eldragon_1> I remember I never bought the combo stuff until the very end of the game.
[1:19:58] <sunnythedrunk> easy
[1:19:59] <%chosenjuan42> big brain
[1:20:01] <leith_aziz> @Story_Ark: Thats because of weapon variety, Spiderman's tools are thematically pretty similar
[1:20:02] <%aram909> then once you start solving more riddler stuff he starts getting audibly worried and concerned
[1:20:04] <T_Sasquatch> @Story_Ark i actually prefer spidey combat but the gadgets he has are too broken and they just win fights
[1:20:06] <Lancaster_H> memes aside, perfectly countering everyone in a fight is a very "feel like batman" thing
[1:20:15] <+Gohyakuen> Batman HATES grates
[1:20:15] <+Crippl3> riddler doesn't talk after every statue
[1:20:16] <Reckless_Rob> Henlo guys
[1:20:18] <leith_aziz> Arkham layed the groundworks, but I think Shadow of mordor and Spiderman showed the best of this combat system
[1:20:19] <+Story_Ark> the spiderman combat is great but the gadgets kinda suck. i like how here theyre part of the combos and you can do some crazy stuff
[1:20:19] <Darren716> LUL
[1:20:21] <Doctadaking> Let this play out
[1:20:23] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:20:24] <user_naim> Punch is default, Counter is reaction, then right back to punching
[1:20:25] <leith_aziz> No shit, Batman

[1:20:35] <iLike_femboys> fuck this people i need more riddler trophies
[1:20:36] <+twohitgood> that vent was so annoying for me because the grapple refused to target it when I played.

[1:21:25] <+fugatlas> silent takedowns aint silent anymore
[1:21:28] <%krispen_wa> CASH NOOO
[1:21:32] <mankeymania> what some type of suicide squad ?
[1:21:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Game audio is low
[1:21:32] <%mundanelotus> So is the game audio low to avoid strikes??
[1:21:33] <SpartanDumpster> Was there a tire behind Joker?
[1:21:41] <peachy996> Blackgate is like Arkham but for Criminals
[1:21:45] <iLike_femboys> the sonic batarang is the best upgrade
[1:21:48] <+AmanDotZip> wouldnt joker know by now that henchman will never beat batman??
[1:21:48] <+twohitgood> takedown alert
[1:21:51] <+sevorai> audiio is low for a reason
[1:21:53] <+Gohyakuen> look at this m effer casually siting by the stairs

[1:22:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yep
[1:22:13] <+TwitchZoomer2021> How blind is this?
[1:22:14] <@Solidus_113> what's that noise?
[1:22:21] <Lancaster_H> @Freeborg1997 extremely
[1:22:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> distract them away or take them down last
[1:22:25] <+Story_Ark> its good for silent stealth iirc
[1:22:25] <%X2Eliah> @Freeborg1997 oh big blind
[1:22:27] <+fugatlas> double blind
[1:22:28] <%Javaa01> If stealth takedown an enemy, another one will come to investigate
[1:22:28] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus get the sonic batarang when you can, its the best gadget in this game
[1:22:31] <+bairros> you can take them down, but the others will investigate
[1:22:38] <dinnydanny777> Metal Gear Batman
[1:22:38] <guts32> He is blind it's amazing that he can play videogames
[1:22:40] <T_Sasquatch> paige blind
[1:22:40] <%chosenjuan42> Look over there
[1:22:44] <brachydios777> No back seating chat
[1:22:47] <sunnythedrunk> More like it's a way to lure enemies away
[1:22:50] <Lancaster_H> f u n n e l
[1:22:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Is that batman on the far wall?
[1:22:57] <+0neReeler> wait he's not killing so they'd still have a a heartbeat, slow detection
[1:22:57] <Reckless_Rob> Battle Gear Solid
[1:22:58] <+Story_Ark> my tactic i like is putting explosive gel on a wall, use the sonic to lure them there, then KABOOM!!
[1:22:59] <%krispen_wa> FUNNELS
[1:23:01] <+Grayhammatter> funnel
[1:23:07] <3Xgilly> funnel PogChamp
[1:23:11] <SpartanDumpster> No that batarang is to make enemies think one of those collars are going off. It's like throwing a magazine in MGS.
[1:23:11] <Mangahero18> @peachy996 Arkham is already a prison in everything in name. Its just a place for Batman to stash the assholes when he's tired of beating on em. No one ACTUALLY gets real help there.
[1:23:12] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> That door looks like batman.
[1:23:14] <%rottingpastry> you can always come back to areas that matter
[1:23:15] <%chosenjuan42> you can go back if you want
[1:23:15] <VidulaSaix> Don't worry Woolie it's basically like a Metroid game

[1:23:37] <guts32> @0neReeler Heartbeat changes when they out cold i guess
[1:23:38] <iLike_femboys> fuck cash i need more riddler shit
[1:23:40] <+TwitchZoomer2021> Batman:... *leaves*
[1:23:43] <+el_hearto> @0neReeler The hearbeat would still lower since they're going unconsciousness. Which will alert the guards.
[1:23:45] <+Gohyakuen> "What Am I? Alfred? Uh... I mean a random butler"
[1:23:51] <casualshinji> The game never looks you out of areas permanently.
[1:23:52] <peachy996> @Mangahero18 Blackgate Prison is basically Arkham Asylum when the Insanity plead doesn't work
[1:24:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Sorry I can‚Äôt save you Cash, I gotta find Riddler trophies

[1:28:41] <enerkaizer> a good ol lead-diet LUL
[1:28:43] <user_naim> Just glide BEHIND them, then do a silent takedown.
[1:28:43] <Lancaster_H> crouch + Y to ground takedown remember @WoolieVersus
[1:28:44] <+PikeBot> The glid attack just knocks over it doesn't KO, you need to follow up wiht w ground takedown
[1:28:45] <PanicSwytch> Glide kick doesn't knockout
[1:28:47] <picanoturna> its the freaking bat
[1:28:50] <%SainEdge> yeah glide attacks are not so great for stealth LUL
[1:28:51] <deviljhojho_> Batman has the flu
[1:28:51] <%cursedwithadhd> "Health is good"

[1:29:12] <leith_aziz> Guys...
[1:29:13] <+Ricky_Rexx> did those just just run into each other?
[1:29:14] <CrematedCube> Dropping down for silent takedowns is an option
[1:29:15] <BlackermanZX> and thats why you need batarangs
[1:29:17] <+Gohyakuen> in city they are even better
[1:29:22] <brunoberserk> RT+Y whens the guy is in the ground

[1:29:53] <+LionKagura> its not a takedown
[1:29:54] <R3c0n31> Woolie has learned
[1:29:54] <+Story_Ark> crouch plus y

[1:29:56] <+CptBritches> It will say the word takedown if it KOs
[1:29:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Or sneak up behind them for the sneak kill
[1:29:56] <%mundanelotus> you can also glide behind and takedown

[1:30:01] <Wofoeh> You're just fucking with thim at this point
[1:30:01] <marvel877> Glide KICK, nowhere does it ever say TAKEDOWN.
[1:30:02] <plaguedoctor_syan> it fine
[1:30:03] <+Ricky_Rexx> chat scream very much
[1:30:03] <%doomerskeletor13> I love the idea that Batman just glide kicks them and flies away
[1:30:08] <peachy996> It's been a week since you last played so no worries
[1:30:08] <guts32> you can jump from a gargoyle and land next to an inmate and stealth knock them out
[1:30:09] <Lancaster_H> its also not stealthy
[1:30:11] <chainsaw105> "god I just got kicked in the back of the head"
[1:30:11] <%dj_xo98> Glide kick woolie
[1:30:11] <splinter1619> ground takedown can also be used in normal combat if you find an opening for it
[1:30:13] <marvel877> Reading is hard.

[1:30:23] <%X2Eliah> No inverted takedown works but it must be ABOVE the guy not to side
[1:30:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Intended.
[1:30:24] <Asuterisuku> That gargoyle is too far ahead of the walkway for Bruce to reach.
[1:30:24] <+ChancellorOfLights> lol that works
[1:30:24] <Wofoeh> What the fuck happened
[1:30:24] <%rottingpastry> do you have to do the hang to do inverted takedown?
[1:30:25] <+allups> that what u wana do LUL

[1:30:28] <+Gohyakuen> it works
[1:30:30] <masterfire23> imagine getting dropped kicked by batman and then he runs away
[1:30:32] <%mundanelotus> glide kicks be loud
[1:30:34] <Lancaster_H> inverted takedown does work alert doesnt mean shit
[1:30:41] <Lancaster_H> they just have to be actually under you
[1:30:41] <daswampken> Bat botch
[1:30:41] <user_naim> Learning
[1:30:41] <Asuterisuku> Mark is so good.
[1:30:42] <dundore77> the inverted take down wont work in that corner unless they are on the ground they are undrneath you
[1:30:45] <Hawkbone_> How many hours before Woolie realizes he
[1:30:45] <%CptnCampy61> They gotta be right under you
[1:30:45] <+0neReeler> LUL
[1:30:46] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I really like that they tell you their heart rates but I wish it had a more powerful effect. Like, if you mess with them too much they just pass out
[1:30:48] <picanoturna> no glide kicks
[1:30:51] <amanda_vita> Does he ever play fighting SF games?
[1:30:53] <+Story_Ark> dont think of the ground takedowns as rt plus y, but as crouch plus y
[1:30:54] <iLike_femboys> i love how woolie makes his own rules for this game
[1:30:56] <%chosenjuan42> SLAP
[1:31:04] <Hawkbone_> How many hours before Woolie realizes he's wrong about how inverted takedowns work?
[1:31:08] <+twohitgood> takedown work while they're alerted. they need to be underneath, though
[1:31:10] <picanoturna> you can use the grates too

[1:31:42] <GilliamYaeger> LOSER
[1:31:42] <Asuterisuku> Woolie, the other guy was not in the right place.
[1:31:43] <BreakersAweigh> has he tried using any of he gear? like his batarangs or explosive gel for distractions?
[1:31:45] <Lancaster_H> woolie, they have to be ACTUALLY UNDER YOU to inverted takedown
[1:31:46] <Adamisfruit> New session struggles onlyafroWeird
[1:31:49] <picanoturna> learning
[1:31:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @dranok_x
[1:31:51] <Lancaster_H> the corner doesnt work because of that
[1:31:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> reggie what
[1:31:53] <dundore77> They have to be directly underneath you. The gargoyles hang too far out for the railings
[1:31:53] <asdief_> can you distract with batarangs?
[1:31:54] <kulmoth> it wasn't because of alert, he wasn't under the gargoyle
[1:31:56] <%rottingpastry> you couldn't do the other guy because he wasn't below the head of the gargoyle
[1:31:56] <huskarl_zap> IT SAYS YOUR A L O S E R!
[1:31:56] <casualshinji> That goon that killed Batman is gonna get so much ass.

[1:32:00] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Woolie the takedowns work only when the guy is DURECTLY BELOW
[1:32:01] <%doomerskeletor13> That one corner is just fucked and won‚Äôt let you do inverted takedowns
[1:32:02] <peachy996> Bad Angle
[1:32:04] <@Solidus_113> that hasn't worked a single time
[1:32:07] <user_naim> They have to be under you
[1:32:09] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Woolie is figuring out the system
[1:32:12] <brunoberserk> Batman is trying his best ...
[1:32:12] <+Story_Ark> you could just drop down and go behind them
[1:32:15] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus use your gadgets more often when you cant takedown
[1:32:16] <+allups> u could choke them
[1:32:17] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie will figure it out
[1:32:24] <+nekodelic> @WoolieVersus using the hook shot to knock them down the fence is also an instant takedown
[1:32:28] <TallPixels> you can always just crouch walk behind them
[1:32:30] <+Ricky_Rexx> there was a whole episode of the animated series about a nameless goon who everyone thought killed batman, man became an instant legend
[1:32:33] <%krispen_wa> AAAAAAH
[1:32:41] <Indigo_Automaton> I just got here, what did I miss them do earlier in the stream?
[1:32:48] <Asuterisuku> You can freak out anyone looking at an inverted goon by tossing a Batarang at them.
[1:32:50] <+Story_Ark> there we go+
[1:32:51] <+allups> nice
[1:32:53] <CoffeeShopA> @WoolieVersus You also do not have to hang for the inverted takedown
[1:32:55] <sunnythedrunk> nice
[1:32:55] <+DizzyGunner> he finally figured it out
[1:32:56] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[1:32:56] <iLike_femboys> A+
[1:32:56] <%gnoame> Did you just get a gadget to use on people with collars like this?
[1:32:57] <deviljhojho_> nice
[1:32:58] <%rottingpastry> clean
[1:32:59] <dinnydanny777> don't worry about that box guy
[1:33:00] <picanoturna> good stuff
[1:33:00] <Depthcharge2030> noice
[1:33:01] <leith_aziz> @BurncoatRapscallion: If their heart-rate is very high and you just land in front of them they get spooked and just freeze in place (not in a buggy way), letting you land a punch and knock them down
[1:33:03] <Asuterisuku> Well done.
[1:33:03] <BlackermanZX> good ol bat choke
[1:33:03] <nicversus> good thing he didn't notice that garbage can falling down the stairs
[1:33:03] <splinter1619> grapple pull an enemy off a high ledge to definitely not kill them
[1:33:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why is audio still low if you're not monetizing the YouTube vod?
[1:33:08] <iLike_femboys> you are doing great sweetie
[1:33:09] <+allups> more of the same lets go
[1:33:13] <%rottingpastry> @gnoame the upgrade is available. he couldn't buy it
[1:33:21] <user_naim> Now he‚Äôs doing it
[1:33:25] <keankong85> the more you remain hidden the more they panic
[1:33:27] <+allups> ez
[1:33:29] <user_naim> good job Woolie
[1:33:29] <+Gohyakuen> batman is such a good ninja he can kick trashcans and no one notices
[1:33:30] <+nomad390> Gel up those bois
[1:33:30] <Frodiddly> You can make some noise by hucking a batarang near them, split em up
[1:33:31] <sunnythedrunk> yOu hEaRd jOKeR
[1:33:32] <iLike_femboys> he is starting to FEEL like batman
[1:33:33] <marvel877> Has Woolie tried using batarangs like you can toss empty magazines in MGS?
[1:33:40] <sweetestbeefs> i forgot this game doesnt tell you how many guys are left
[1:33:42] <+allups> bata rang doest knock people out
[1:33:43] <@akuda_bar> i love how joker is watching batman foil his plan and just going Kappa
[1:33:43] <leith_aziz> I should tell you that you can pull them off the ledges
[1:33:43] <GilliamYaeger> They're covering each others backs, that's super cool
[1:33:43] <keankong85> thats what you want
[1:33:44] <Asuterisuku> Doesn't work twice from the same Gargoyle, Woolie.
[1:33:45] <peachy996> The Stylish knockouts Woolie will have to discover on his own
[1:33:47] <@Solidus_113> you can't
[1:33:49] <dundore77> only one hanging person per gargoyle
[1:33:49] <Darren716> You cant hang if theres a body
[1:33:50] <Daxalog> You already inverted a guy there
[1:33:51] <brachydios777> Nice
[1:33:52] <+MagiKestral> you can cut the line
[1:33:52] <R3c0n31> there is already a body on that gargoyale
[1:33:52] <+Story_Ark> crouch y!
[1:33:53] <picanoturna> let him figure it out
[1:33:54] <Darren716> NO
[1:33:56] <peachy996> Like that one
[1:33:56] <CaptainBright> You can't invert takedown on a gargoyle that's been used
[1:33:57] <+allups> nice
[1:33:59] <Bloodhit> There already guy on that
[1:33:59] <%ZeeJiggle> Just fukkin Goomba stomped him
[1:34:02] <+ChancellorOfLights> üëè
[1:34:02] <+Ricky_Rexx> can't invert two on one gargoyle
[1:34:03] <%X2Eliah> TACO DOWN
[1:34:03] <+allups> nice good shit
[1:34:04] <BlackermanZX> you can cut the body hanging up iirc
[1:34:07] <iLike_femboys> damn you batman adumSociety
[1:34:09] <guts32> IF NO BATS THEN THEY AINT DOWN
[1:34:11] <%rottingpastry> I can't remember if takedown works if you cut the body down
[1:34:12] <%emperordread> keep beatin them up till the bats come out
[1:34:13] <chainsaw105> batman crip walking over the man's stunned body as he recovers
[1:34:14] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You can only take down one enemy per gargoyle, you need to cut them down with a batarang to free up the gargoyle again
[1:34:15] <+DizzyGunner> the tbag takedown
[1:34:17] <TurranosOrn> JUST DROP DOWN
[1:34:18] <%rottingpastry> but it's fun to cut the body down lol
[1:34:21] <TurranosOrn> DROP DOWN
[1:34:23] <TurranosOrn> DROP DOWN AND TAKE HIM OUT
[1:34:24] <NoireRequiem> I know i‚Äôm probs alone on this but I really wish there was a good coop mode for the arkam games
[1:34:25] <TurranosOrn> PLEASEI
[1:34:26] <Jathspuh> the joker baby monkaS
[1:34:27] <Asuterisuku> It's easier to get down than up.
[1:34:27] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus crouch y is also good in regular combat and it continues the combos fyi
[1:34:29] <%chosenjuan42> Crouch Light punch or 2L
[1:34:30] <TurranosOrn> I'M BEGGING YOU
[1:34:30] <casualshinji> You can cut down dudes hanging from the gargoyles.
[1:34:31] <leith_aziz> If you already used an inverted takedown then you have to drop the body off the gargoyle first to get another takedown
[1:34:31] <+allups> it wouldve been clean
[1:34:32] <%NorthGrizzly> You can pull people off with batclaw
[1:34:32] <+MagiKestral> you can't take down two enemies on the same gargoyle, BUT you can cut them down on top of people!
[1:34:33] <sweetestbeefs> batarang then take him out?
[1:34:34] <TurranosOrn> DROP DOWN
[1:34:35] <kulmoth> woolie is trying to rely too much on the gargoyle gimmick takedown
[1:34:36] <guts32> oh this is a little painful
[1:34:37] <masterfire23> you can hang and drop down
[1:34:38] <iLike_femboys> @Jathspuh adumSociety
[1:34:44] <leith_aziz> huh ?

[1:35:01] <+allups> stealth like a G
[1:35:03] <T_Sasquatch> SILENT
[1:35:04] <%chosenjuan42> You can use same gargoyle as long as you cut the rope with batarang
[1:35:05] <@akuda_bar> did you hear something? i thought i just heard something
[1:35:05] <+Ricky_Rexx> like a really awkward shadow
[1:35:08] <keankong85> too noisy
[1:35:10] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's not a stealth divekick
[1:35:11] <guts32> @kulmoth i barely ever use it because it's not that great maybe only on challenge maps
[1:35:11] <Jathspuh> @iLike_femboys WutFace
[1:35:12] <brunoberserk> BOTCHMAAAAAAN
[1:35:12] <%emperordread> Snake, this is a sneaking mission
[1:35:12] <+Ricky_Rexx> must have been the wind
[1:35:14] <Asuterisuku> Not a lot of health left.
[1:35:16] <peachy996> Good thing you bought that health upgrade
[1:35:17] <Lancaster_H> what was that noise
[1:35:19] <alroy900> a really noisy shadow
[1:35:22] <nicversus> Woolie: *has perfect opportunity* Woolie: "Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I dunno" Woolie: *misses the window of opportunity*
[1:35:23] <iLike_femboys> 2fast4you
[1:35:42] <+Story_Ark> he got scared
[1:35:43] <Hawkbone_> Did you know? Batman is a ninja, and an expert in stealth and silent martial arts.
[1:35:45] <brachydios777> Huh?
[1:35:45] <kulmoth> @guts32 yeah they suck
[1:35:46] <sweetestbeefs> they shoot out of fear sometimes
[1:35:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> CORNER TAKEDOWN
[1:35:47] <%chosenjuan42> he's not under from there unfortunately
[1:35:49] <Asuterisuku> Terrified guards will occasionally shoot at shadows.

[1:37:23] <GilliamYaeger> What's that heavy breathing?
[1:37:23] <Hawkbone_> Yes
[1:37:24] <guts32> yes
[1:37:25] <+allups> it coo
[1:37:27] <%chosenjuan42> yes
[1:37:28] <+Story_Ark> wait not in asylum?
[1:37:29] <rytisone> he's learnding
[1:37:29] <picanoturna> learning ppl
[1:37:30] <user_naim> yup
[1:37:31] <sweetestbeefs> can't spam it tho, they'll wise up eventually
[1:37:33] <iLike_femboys> learning berdHype
[1:37:34] <brachydios777> Learning tech
[1:37:34] <Yung_FckUp> you can be a ratman
[1:37:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Learning the tech
[1:37:35] <marvel877> You have a PLETHORA of options.
[1:37:36] <Depthcharge2030> you're doing good woolie
[1:37:37] <CaptainBright> protip for City: This is how you fight Freeze
[1:37:38] <kulmoth> you can just also run around crouched
[1:37:39] <%emperordread> As above, so below
[1:37:39] <mankeymania> new tech
[1:37:39] <Hawkbone_> Yes in Asylum
[1:37:39] <%rottingpastry> the point of this room is "lol see this thing you didn't use, dumbass?"
[1:37:41] <%chosenjuan42> labbing
[1:37:43] <brunoberserk> yes the game give you a lot of options
[1:37:44] <+ChancellorOfLights> not sure if they tutorialized it
[1:37:44] <leith_aziz> No, no, I remember now that you could here too
[1:37:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> it's a good thing these goons have no ability to look up or down, only immediately ahead
[1:37:45] <Asuterisuku> There are rooms later where they encourage you NOT to gargoyle up.
[1:37:45] <%SainEdge> i dont think there are takedowns from these vents, they added them in city
[1:37:46] <CrematedCube> There are creative options available
[1:37:47] <+Story_Ark> protip for chat: dont spoil later fames
[1:37:49] <$priceyyeti40> Woolie's gonna have fun in THAT ROOM
[1:37:49] <%NorthGrizzly> There are options
[1:37:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> sure but
[1:37:52] <+Story_Ark> *games
[1:37:54] <+MetalPanic> the exaggerated swagger of a metropolitian billionare
[1:38:00] <+cinder_chan> I'm really glad they shifted the UI design for city onward
[1:38:05] <Jathspuh> Sadge
[1:38:06] <FrostedZaibatsu> You learn this game after you beat it LUL
[1:38:12] <leith_aziz> Its either here or in City where you can takedown from vents
[1:38:14] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I think Woolie would love Arkham City
[1:38:23] <Forkeye> I hate how you have to use detective vision constantly and it prevents you from appreciating the art
[1:38:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @cinder_chan combat way smoother too
[1:38:27] <sweetestbeefs> honestly i forgot how much city improves over asylum
[1:38:28] <Komayeda> Oh, Arkham City is *great*
[1:38:29] <BreakersAweigh> arkham city kicked ass
[1:38:31] <brachydios777> I think I know what‚Äôs up next
[1:38:32] <CoffeeShopA> Do we know if Woolie is planning on playing the whole trilogy or just Asylum?
[1:38:32] <peachy996> The jobber that thinks he could have saved the world. More of this character needs to exist
[1:38:33] <Indigo_Automaton> Did they already fight Croc?
[1:38:36] <iLike_femboys> arkham city is the best one
[1:38:41] <+Story_Ark> woolie would love this too, but it just needs to click
[1:38:43] <brachydios777> Croc is way later
[1:38:44] <TheWizardOfWordplay> no croc yet
[1:38:44] <peachy996> Croc is later
[1:38:47] <iLike_femboys> @Indigo_Automaton nope
[1:38:49] <Komayeda> Doctor Strange, the best batman villain
[1:38:50] <+Mrhennybottle> Arkham city is definitely the best one
[1:38:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @ilike_femboys fact
[1:38:56] <sweetestbeefs> croc is WAY later
[1:39:01] <Asuterisuku> You can't get that riddle yet, if I recall.
[1:39:04] <Aydarkzero> disappointed City is so good
[1:39:05] <Indigo_Automaton> Sick, I don't remember when a lot of stuff happens in Asylum
[1:39:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @komayeda wait a minute Kappa
[1:39:09] <+Story_Ark> nope no fall damage
[1:39:12] <%Stupid121v2> nah
[1:39:16] <BlackermanZX> thank kod for no fall damage
[1:39:17] <Lancaster_H> woolie youre batman
[1:39:18] <Hawkbone_> Woolie just now realized there's no fall damage?
[1:39:19] <R3c0n31> no fall damage
[1:39:20] <Lancaster_H> what the fuck is fall damage
[1:39:20] <TheWizardOfWordplay> no fall damage ever.
[1:39:21] <picanoturna> you're batman
[1:39:22] <Asuterisuku> Bruce's cowl is good for stuff like that.
[1:39:22] <%jinking79> Batman Villain u never see often Lockdown
[1:39:26] <user_naim> Cut down the bad guy for funsies
[1:39:27] <brunoberserk> batman dont take fall damage
[1:39:31] <Manmush> you really think they're gonna want to do a trilogy of demonetized videos
[1:39:33] <Komayeda> I can't speak for Origins, but I feel like Knight was a step down from City, even though I still liked it a lot
[1:39:34] <brachydios777> Physically hitting the enemy makes noise
[1:39:51] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Has woolie remarked on the battle damage to the suit yet?
[1:39:53] <sweetestbeefs> @Komayeda combat-wise, not really? story wise? yeah
[1:39:55] <+TheotherKristian> Can't wait until Woolie reaches Arkham City, five months from now
[1:39:55] <%X2Eliah> croc? really?
[1:39:59] <plaguedoctor_syan> dont worry Woolie
[1:40:03] <dinnydanny777> He's not insane? limesO limesHmm

[1:40:12] <T_Sasquatch> @Komayeda what ? you dont like using that stupid fucking tank constantly ??
[1:40:12] <anAngryHamster> @jinking79 He never escaped from the Animates Series did he?
[1:40:13] <+Story_Ark> the funniest is cutting down a guy from inverted when he's still conscious
[1:40:14] <Komayeda> I mean, we've also got an overwhelming amount of Bat Tank
[1:40:14] <leith_aziz> Otherwise, not really

[1:40:22] <Asuterisuku> Logs for different characters are in different areas. Harley in Intensive Care, for example, or Riddler in Medical.
[1:40:26] <+nomad390> I want more coc
[1:40:28] <FrostedZaibatsu> Scarecrow's later redesign is my fav
[1:40:34] <$emptyantics> Origins is my personal favorite but it is heavy flawed
[1:40:40] <iLike_femboys> scarecrow is so cool Kreygasm
[1:40:43] <huskarl_zap> Consider this chat, Pat and Scarecrow have the same training.
[1:40:48] <TheWizardOfWordplay> we need to tell him about the room when he's in the warden's office

[1:41:09] <jowi_time> "I THREW A ROCK AT HIM!!"
[1:41:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Scarecrow definitely one of the most fascinating Batman villains
[1:41:14] <brachydios777> Croc is reformed in the comics, yes?
[1:41:14] <+Mr_Pylon> Cros very proud of that time he threw a rock.

[1:41:25] <%Double_Tap_That> Back then I wasn't Killer Croc, I was just Brutality Croc
[1:41:25] <TheInvincibleNWP> Bats. Crane's afraid of bats.
[1:41:31] <peachy996> I think his Origins Voice is better but props to Blum regardless

[1:55:16] <SpartanDumpster> @WoolieVersus stunning isn't to counter red flashes, it's just guys with knives you usually gotta stun.
[1:55:16] <%doomerskeletor13> A present!
[1:55:19] <MinersLoveGames> @doomerskeletor13 They didin't mention "dead kittens" so I assume that it was literally just a box of kitten covered in marzipan.
[1:55:20] <sweetestbeefs> woolie's not looking at chat anymore LUL
[1:55:20] <wujak> if you ever just want to practice combat, the challenges in these games are very good

[1:55:35] <%phd_in_thuggery> Let woolie play how he wants to play
[1:55:43] <Komayeda> Marzipan is a confection consisting primarily of sugar or honey and almond meal (ground almonds), sometimes augmented with almond oil or extract.
[1:55:43] <T_Sasquatch> Im shocked most of you remember where shit is located in this game
[1:55:45] <Allenou> this one's the worst it's ever been

[2:02:25] <majindusto> *fine
[2:02:27] <Laironx3> use the right bat gadget
[2:02:29] <filialpails> NOT A TAKEDOWN
[2:02:38] <+allups> at little late in the game if u ask me
[2:02:39] <leith_aziz> But I get that too some it is frutrating
[2:02:44] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Joker's trick
[2:02:46] <%rottingpastry> The game is the one making him throw the batarang lol
[2:02:46] <$emptyantics> NotLikeThis
[2:02:47] <brunoberserk> the batarang disarms
[2:02:48] <dukenux> The BATARANG Takedown is the most silent Takedown
[2:02:49] <user_naim> just to knock the gun guy down to start things off
[2:02:53] <plaguedoctor_syan> that wierd he just let his gun on the floor
[2:02:55] <keankong85> did you see an umbrella or two
[2:02:56] <%LastHazzerd> must suck having every thing you say scrutinized
[2:03:00] <waffleandman> the sequel does another of these mechanics better
[2:03:03] <Asuterisuku> I believe LT+Y is the Quick Claw shortcut in this game.
[2:03:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:03:04] <slix3431> Lol these angry bat-nerds are great
[2:03:04] <+discognition> check hallway for penguin gear

[2:03:20] <+allups> there is cat women stuff in this room
[2:03:33] <T_Sasquatch> @LastHazzerd just gotta stop taking it personally or ignore it
[2:03:38] <brunoberserk> you can disarm with the batclaw in this game ? i forgot ...
[2:03:38] <nicversus> Uh oh, the blue skeletons turned red
[2:03:43] <@Solidus_113> bonk
[2:03:45] <thatangryguyofde> Riddle "It's a major start to a day" It's breakfast. Woolie "I don't get it"
[2:03:47] <T_Sasquatch> I remember being stuck in this fucking room
[2:03:47] <nicversus> aggrp skeletons
[2:03:52] <nicversus> *aggro
[2:03:56] <%X2Eliah> *crick*
[2:04:00] <BlackermanZX> screw those red guys
[2:04:00] <dinnydanny777> sometimes maybe good sometimes maybe shit
[2:04:01] <TheWizardOfWordplay> in this game I think it's double rt
[2:04:10] <peachy996> The Knife Boys
[2:04:14] <Grunkle_Dan_> looks back at history in British.
[2:04:20] <T_Sasquatch> knife dudes are the worst
[2:04:21] <valriot> LUL
[2:04:22] <peachy996> Red you cannot counter
[2:04:24] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus So yeah don't worry, the reg guys do actually suck
[2:04:25] <nicversus> fun fact when you enter combat mode your skeleton turns red
[2:04:25] <KgKid51> really love the combat In these games
[2:04:27] <+Bearded_mushrum> kick these freaks woolie
[2:04:31] <guts32> stop smashing them buttons
[2:04:34] <+thee_king_karma> The flip
[2:04:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> red means dodge
[2:04:42] <wujak> you also have the dodge when double tapping a to get away from the knife guys
[2:04:44] <PMda2nd> Batman shanked
[2:04:46] <+Bearded_mushrum> dont let them get you on the ground and stomp on your face
[2:04:47] <@Solidus_113> don't wait, you can stun at any time to open them up
[2:04:48] <%mundanelotus> you don't have to wait
[2:04:51] <slix3431> Comeback!
[2:04:52] <+DomunDomunDomun> Just stun them.
[2:04:52] <+BurncoatRapscallion> The knife boys aren't marauders, you can take them out at your own pace
[2:04:54] <+allups> ya cuz otherwise they just block
[2:04:54] <Doctadaking> Double tap A to flip over guys
[2:04:54] <sunnythedrunk> You can stun them before they attack
[2:04:54] <brachydios777> Mashing B for knife boys is viable
[2:04:55] <+DomunDomunDomun> 4Head
[2:04:58] <splinter1619> If you need time to think you can do one dodge roll that will maintain your combo
[2:04:58] <peachy996> That's the way
[2:05:12] <user_naim> ‚ÄùI‚Äôll just wait‚Äù
[2:05:13] <%rottingpastry> you're missing the dodge
[2:05:13] <unthought> looking a bit battle damaged there
[2:05:13] <+0neReeler> can't counter red, have to stun
[2:05:14] <Lancaster_H> yeah we noticed
[2:05:15] <TallPixels> Remember you can vault over enemies to position yourself
[2:05:16] <%mundanelotus> if anything you should prioritize the knife guys
[2:05:21] <+TheotherKristian> Yes, we are all in the backseat of Woolie's car/
[2:05:21] <guts32> You are just bad
[2:05:22] <+Gohyakuen> try dodging towards them
[2:05:22] <BlackermanZX> you are not dodging
[2:05:23] <jaysondeez> I think knife guys block which breaks combo right?
[2:05:25] <peachy996> You need to learn how to Goon Jump
[2:05:26] <Grunkle_Dan_> You'll get it eventually. It becomes almost instinct.
[2:05:28] <+EmptyFist> Just mash out a stun on the knife guys. It's ezpz
[2:05:29] <+FuqBoiSlim> just don't get hit 4Head
[2:05:33] <Prevot> what's not clicking is the fact that it really isn't THAT good
[2:05:34] <leith_aziz> You should try jumping over opponents more
[2:05:38] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you can do challenge maps for practice
[2:05:39] <sunnythedrunk> Just focus on the knife guys with stuns
[2:05:40] <valriot> LUL LUL
[2:05:40] <Darren716> I liked the knife guys in City way better
[2:05:41] <sunnythedrunk> first
[2:05:42] <leith_aziz> It keeps the rhythm
[2:05:43] <dundore77> If you played the Shadow of Mordor games its the same idea but just an earlier version of it
[2:05:44] <Johannen> Wierd how Woolie is not clicking with this combat when he played Spider-Man
[2:05:45] <+Crippl3> you dont have to wait for their attack to stun, just press B whenever
[2:05:45] <brunoberserk> LUL LUL LUL
[2:05:46] <splinter1619> challenge maps are great
[2:05:47] <SixthShinx> Just get better 4Head

[2:05:56] <%Double_Tap_That> woolieONEGUY
[2:05:57] <wujak> might be worth doing some of the combat challenges to get a better place to practice
[2:05:58] <stukamod> great comment
[2:05:59] <guts32> @prevoz it's not that hard really it's pretty simple combat
[2:06:00] <%rottingpastry> challenge maps will make you git gud yes
[2:06:00] <Reaganball_Z> The Sonic Baterang is known to roll around at the speed of sound
[2:06:01] <%MajkirM> woolieONEGUY
[2:06:01] <user_naim> Punch is default, then react to the lightning prompts
[2:06:02] <%LCLSmoothie> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[2:06:02] <+thewellroundedgamer99> You need to hit the lab
[2:06:02] <jaysondeez> it might be always be reactionary to knife guys until they are stunned
[2:06:04] <+0neReeler> protip: gitgud
[2:06:05] <%saladin1911> Why do people get off on being assholes? Fucking hell man, go shit in your own cereal
[2:06:05] <brachydios777> Don‚Äôt be mean One Guy
[2:06:06] <+allups> ignore the chatters woolz LUL
[2:06:06] <%Stupid121v2> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[2:06:07] <T_Sasquatch> personally i think you just need to react once you see the counter symbol
[2:06:11] <@Menitta> yall need to chill
[2:06:13] <Asuterisuku> Do you smell gas?
[2:06:15] <MinersLoveGames> Arkham City really, really improves upon it.
[2:06:17] <Hawkbone_> Accidental sequence break
[2:06:19] <waffleandman> their playthrough made me play through the whole game again because of how they were playing LUL
[2:06:20] <KgKid51> monkaS
[2:06:22] <+nabs2099> why is One Guy always such a little bitch
[2:06:23] <peachy996> Without Goon Jump you're forced on the defensive.
[2:06:25] <user_naim> Counter blue, stun/dodge red
[2:06:26] <splinter1619> Tick Tock Tick Tock!
[2:06:27] <BlackermanZX> Of course some asshole expects him to be good at this immediately LUL
[2:06:36] <%SainEdge> you can jump around the room when you get to combo 3, you donts need to run or dodge to make distance between enemies
[2:06:41] <brachydios777> Imagine coming to someone‚Äôs stream to call them bad
[2:06:42] <Grunkle_Dan_> @Minerslovegames Arkham City improves on everything though. Masterpiece imo.
[2:06:46] <nicversus> joker has like a full hour of dialog in this game I swear to god. Mark Hamill put in some work
[2:06:49] <guts32> @BlackermanZX it's really not that hard
[2:06:49] <TurranosOrn> It also helps using gadgets and prioritizing targets. Build combos on reg dudes than instant takedown the weapon guys, it helps.
[2:06:50] <J2m0ftw> what helped me learn the game was the bloody palace modes in 2
[2:06:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Did Woolie get the combat in Spider-Man PS4? Cuz it's basically that but clunkier
[2:06:55] <rytisone> It's a real timer
[2:06:57] <+the_vedo_show> oh no
[2:06:59] <%itschickenscratch> i feel the combat gets smoother after you upgrade the special combo takedown to only take 5 hits, and once you realize that the knife guys block any attack that isnt the stun unless they are already stunned
[2:07:01] <+zepelinnn1> @guts32 stop being a little bitch
[2:07:01] <splinter1619> What do you mean the guy who just started playing this game doesnt have the same level of experience as the guy who has platinumed all four games in the series?
[2:07:02] <%rottingpastry> lol
[2:07:04] <CoffeeShopA> It also seems like Asylum is the most diffifult in terms of combat since you don't have nearly the amount of tools you get in the later games
[2:07:07] <@akuda_bar> even Joker is being a one guy
[2:07:09] <+allups> njice
[2:07:14] <KgKid51> nice
[2:07:20] <deviljhojho_> clean
[2:07:24] <Reaganball_Z> Save the skeletons!
[2:07:26] <brachydios777> Fast
[2:07:26] <leith_aziz> nice
[2:07:28] <nicversus> save those blue skeletons!
[2:07:30] <+Damie904> Your combat objective should be to hit them and then react on reflex. You're Batman, your goal should be to take everyone out fast. Make them dance to your rhytm, not the other way around.
[2:07:30] <dinnydanny777> Wow good thing they didn't get hit by any of that falling glass
[2:07:36] <Asuterisuku> Bomb? What bomb?
[2:07:37] <thatangryguyofde> Dr Zed is safe?
[2:07:38] <+0neReeler> covid mod?
[2:07:39] <T_Sasquatch> as a kid i couldnt figure that out LUL

[2:07:42] <valriot> Yes :)
[2:07:46] <Grunkle_Dan_> Those guys just took off their own restraints...
[2:07:48] <Reaganball_Z> Hey, they're wearing a mask! How responsible!
[2:07:48] <unthought> where did he get that giant boxing glove? Is it Killer Croc's?

[2:07:54] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Nice job on getting that on the first go. I had like 3 or 4 attempts before figuring it out

[2:08:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> 7th gen was really a different time
[2:08:32] <peachy996> When you get a handle on using the X/A button on a goon, You stop being defensive and start being more proactive in combat
[2:08:35] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Remember when Joker escaped Arkham on christmas and kidnapped Gordon and the Mayor just so he could give batman a present that was a banana cream pie to the face?
[2:08:49] <BlackermanZX> she really does touch everything
[2:08:58] <plaguedoctor_syan> touching everything with her greasy hands

[2:11:28] <Asuterisuku> This part of the game isn't particularly clear.

[2:15:25] <+TheotherKristian> I love how overused this bit is that we react to Bruce's backstory with "DEAD PARENTS!!!"
[2:15:26] <%mundanelotus> there's probably a mod that lets you play the game as lil Bruce

[2:16:12] <leith_aziz> Nice guy Gordon
[2:16:14] <frostyjay3> My favorite part of Arkham City is the Easter egg you can find of the outline of where Bruce's parent's died.
[2:16:15] <dukenux> LUL

[2:16:16] <secretbosssauce> If we didn't have Gordon we wouldn't have Nightwing

[2:17:09] <peachy996> You managed to get my favorite Scarecrow quote
[2:17:10] <%dreadedcthulhu> when ur done being scared, play elder scrolls
[2:17:10] <+Story_Ark> i fuggin love this design for scarecrow, freddy kreuger lookin ass
[2:17:10] <+nabs2099> This scarecrow is like a virgin compared to the Knight Scarecrow
[2:17:10] <%bearwagon> and the sons of skyrim spilled their own blood
[2:17:11] <+Gohyakuen> I love scarecrow
[2:17:14] <%saladin1911> This sequence is definitely someone's fetish with big twink Sacrecrow
[2:17:14] <+DomunDomunDomun> And at the end of F.E.A.R, Oblivion.
[2:17:14] <Jaysky> Even losing in this game is cool cause you get a different line from the villain
[2:17:15] <%SainEdge> i love the deathscreens in these games
[2:17:15] <splinter1619> Scarecrow stepping things up
[2:17:18] <Halospaz117> So if I beat F.E.A.R. I immediately start playing Oblivion?
[2:17:25] <peachy996> I was really hoping you were going to get that line
[2:17:29] <%rottingpastry> I must break you.

[2:18:21] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I would actually fail a bunch of the segments just to see what the gameover splash was
[2:18:21] <T_Sasquatch> i think this game was the first to have the villain of each section make fun of you when you die
[2:18:28] <Reaganball_Z> His animation looks like he's standing in front of a plate of delicious cookies.

[2:20:45] <%spuddnyk> The Fear!
[2:20:46] <dinnydanny777> he can inject gas?
[2:20:47] <LeBlanc233> true
[2:20:48] <+Walopoh> He's a literal terrorist LUL
[2:20:49] <+taggerung403> Gee Scarecrow how come you get 5 mystery syringes
[2:20:50] <TallPixels> insulin
[2:20:50] <LVL1_Scumbag> Fear juice
[2:20:50] <%SeedTabulous> Fear JUICE.
[2:20:50] <%ZeeJiggle> The Spook Juice
[2:20:52] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> its actually quite close to pats hobo syringe nightmare
[2:20:53] <Darren716> I mean it's effective
[2:20:53] <ARDM112> When will Scarecrow spawn Bruce's greatest enemy, progressive taxes?
[2:20:54] <+0neReeler> the antivaxx nightmare
[2:20:54] <puluxor> Gas? In syringes? More likely than you think.
[2:20:54] <+Grayhammatter> dpm
[2:20:55] <Asuterisuku> Different formulas so that Bruce can't just have the antidote on hand.
[2:20:56] <Doctadaking> This part is finicky
[2:20:58] <PMda2nd> heron
[2:20:58] <+Gohyakuen> you don't have to GAS twice
[2:21:01] <%phd_in_thuggery> This is smart asset reuse
[2:21:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> he injects a bubble of gas i to ur bloodstream and u die
[2:21:03] <sunnythedrunk> Alright Mufasa
[2:21:05] <Halospaz117> Oh dear god Fear Juice is a term
[2:21:07] <Jaysky> You think he'd just give Batman HIV or something and take the long route to victory
[2:21:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's on his fingers, it's not instead of fingers
[2:21:11] <Clundy> Always GAS three times
[2:21:11] <Gutsandlove> the mystery syringes
[2:21:12] <%saladin1911> I mean, literally anything in those syringes would be terrifying
[2:21:15] <+Grayhammatter> don't get it twisted, he's a one trick pony
[2:21:16] <leith_aziz> He had a diiferent gimmick in a BTAS episode where he stopped people from ever experiencing fear
[2:21:17] <%CptnCampy61> Sunny D
[2:21:22] <LoadingFWANK> yea, but one of these days its just gonna be air in one of those syringes
[2:21:26] <dinnydanny777> What if Scarecrow just gave Batman Ebola
[2:21:28] <leith_aziz> It was dangerous in a different weay
[2:21:28] <huskarl_zap> Bruce hates bats so hes the Batman, Pat hates needles so he becomes the empty vaxman
[2:21:29] <Tampaoster> Pat is scared of scarecrow
[2:21:30] <%spuddnyk> Scarecrow just laughs at nothing
[2:21:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yo Scarecrow lookin fresh in that crop top
[2:21:38] <Robot_Nixon_> at least its not something worse like aids

[2:21:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Midriff on point

[2:21:44] <Reaganball_Z> Where does Scarecrow find the time to do his ab routine, though?
[2:21:46] <Dio_TR> Clap
[2:21:47] <%phd_in_thuggery> unless those syringes have some I AINT DOWN
[2:21:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> OH RIGHT IN THE TUMMY
[2:21:49] <+the_vedo_show> very nice woolz
[2:21:52] <%rottingpastry> finally the bat signal is useful
[2:21:54] <randomguy722> @jaysky if that happened, Batman would discover he cure for HIV in less than a week LUL
[2:21:55] <%phd_in_thuggery> *some weed
[2:21:56] <dundore77> if everything is under his control why did he put a light there?

[2:22:17] <Halospaz117> "How'd I end up in Metropolis?"
[2:22:20] <casualshinji> *ends up behind a stripclub in his underwear*
[2:22:21] <Jaysky> @randomguy722 Then Scarecrow would accidentally be the hero gotham deserves
[2:22:24] <+GingerStrawhat> I like that no one apparently saw you tripping balls all the way to the clock tower
[2:22:30] <NeoseekerStitch> In the remake this line from Joker is for some reason not in it
[2:22:32] <leith_aziz> How did he end up here ?
[2:22:34] <%Mattais88> Even high as balls no one can track him
[2:22:37] <leith_aziz> What a weird trip
[2:22:40] <NeoseekerStitch> remaster
[2:22:41] <$emptyantics> ‚ÄúWhy am I in Jersey?‚Äù
[2:22:41] <%patriotrenegade> is that an Amaedus thing behind you? @WoolieVersus
[2:22:42] <dukenux> This Night been going on for how many hours now
[2:22:43] <%Stupid121v2> if I saw batman high off drugs stumbling around id avoid him too tbh lol
[2:22:45] <Asuterisuku> Maybe you should.
[2:22:46] <Hawkbone_> oooh, are we gonna tell Woolie about the Arkham City easter egg in the Wardens Office?
[2:22:47] <+Crippl3> MAYBE
[2:22:50] <+monsieurfantastic> What a dark knight
[2:22:50] <%phd_in_thuggery> "what a mess huuuhuhuhhh
[2:22:52] <T_Sasquatch> hmmmmm
[2:22:52] <Jaysky> @GingerStrawhat I think the skeletons are random mooks Batman beat up while tripping
[2:22:53] <%rottingpastry> reggie is right
[2:22:56] <splinter1619> Remote control is great during stealth
[2:22:57] <+TwitchZoomer2021> I like Batman reacts to the bats floating away, showing there's some residue effect from the fear gas.
[2:23:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did he get inverted takedown yet?
[2:23:02] <puluxor> Spread Shot
[2:23:03] <+condemned_15> it's still just a stun
[2:23:08] <%X2Eliah> @KeiganOfAstora ye
[2:23:09] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I love all the gadgets in the game
[2:23:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Remote Control isn't that good

[2:23:11] <splinter1619> Both
[2:23:11] <user_naim> Habo Bat o trippin
[2:23:11] <Indigo_Automaton> In combat
[2:23:12] <BlackermanZX> twin is good for fights, remote is great for stealth
[2:23:12] <BigBlackBankai> Bruce high on Batsalts
[2:23:14] <brachydios777> He got inverted last stream
[2:23:14] <leith_aziz> Both
[2:23:14] <%Javaa01> @KeiganOfAstora He got it as the 2nd upgrade
[2:23:15] <peachy996> You would have to start using it in combat
[2:23:16] <Torgue_1> @KeiganOfAstora Yes
[2:23:16] <randomguy722> @gingerstrawhat they probably learned to ignore batman's presence
[2:23:16] <T_Sasquatch> im still waiting for when he starts using the explosive in combos LUL
[2:23:16] <Doctadaking> In all situations
[2:23:16] <wujak> both
[2:23:17] <+LeaIsChill> Both????
[2:23:17] <%X2Eliah> BOTH
[2:23:17] <+TwitchZoomer2021> Both
[2:23:18] <Pappajimbo> both
[2:23:19] <@Solidus_113> you get 2 target markers
[2:23:19] <+Crippl3> both
[2:23:19] <Asuterisuku> Remote is more useful in the next two games.
[2:23:20] <%jepupu> "Also upgrades combo batarang"
[2:23:20] <+Walopoh> He may be back to normal but the multiple doses of fear juice has got to erode anybody's sanity. Batman is a fucking loony
[2:23:20] <+the_vedo_show> approachment id say
[2:23:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nah
[2:23:23] <%CptnCampy61> Yes
[2:23:23] <Allenou> You don't need health if you get good
[2:23:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nahhh
[2:23:24] <TheWizardOfWordplay> save it you'll probably get a new gadget soon
[2:23:24] <leith_aziz> This is better I think
[2:23:27] <ajmgamesdev> Both
[2:23:27] <+BurncoatRapscallion> booooo
[2:23:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> You don't need these
[2:23:31] <moonmintparadise> get the control batarang
[2:23:33] <peachy996> Batarang Power is good too
[2:23:34] <dukenux> Raaaar
[2:23:36] <+the_vedo_show> BUFF
[2:23:36] <leith_aziz> Health is always good
[2:23:36] <+Grayhammatter> he's PISSED
[2:23:37] <Banedain> Baterang is good in between attacks for free combo counter
[2:23:37] <@akuda_bar> he loves it

[2:23:43] <brachydios777> BAT RAGE
[2:23:47] <casualshinji> Those muscles look so dirty.
[2:23:48] <+GingerStrawhat> Eh that's just Batman, he's just fighting the air like usual, just ignore him and he'll tire himself out
[2:23:48] <+Walopoh> jermaChomp
[2:23:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> do the power first
[2:23:52] <OblivionSword1> RAGE OF GOTHAM
[2:23:53] <Robot_Nixon_> atpCap backseat andys
[2:23:53] <Asuterisuku> You need combo batarang for it to be worth it.
[2:23:54] <Jaysky> It's good for upping combos but not much else
[2:23:55] <Johannen> Are guns worth using in DMC?
[2:24:00] <peachy996> Most if not all of these upgrades are good and you'll get them all anyway
[2:24:01] <dinnydanny777> You would think Batman would have something for dealing with gases hih
[2:24:02] <user_naim> Kill the Fight!
[2:24:03] <dinnydanny777> huh*
[2:24:05] <BlackermanZX> combo batatar is the thing you need

[2:24:19] <Asuterisuku> RIP this building's structural integrity
[2:24:19] <randomguy722> @walopoh with so many fear gas shots, he loses his sanity and becomes the Batman in Dark knight
[2:24:22] <+GenesisKnight> It's fine
[2:24:23] <@Solidus_113> Bruce Wayne will pay for that
[2:24:23] <+condemned_15> property damage!
[2:24:23] <peachy996> Who's cleaning that shit up Batman?
[2:24:26] <TheWizardOfWordplay> hope no one was down there
[2:24:27] <Clundy> BINGO
[2:24:28] <Hawkbone_> OI, ITS 5 BONG

[2:24:35] <%X2Eliah> That bell drop is some dark souls shit
[2:24:35] <Darren716> Who does the Asylum even bill for that?
[2:24:37] <%Seancicle> Keaton Batman memory
[2:24:39] <leith_aziz> @Johannen: They help maintain combos, but arent used for dmage
[2:24:41] <+samuraiknack> Never forget due to multiple scarecrow and Joker gas attacks and a cocktail of drugs including LSD an heroin everything is canon to Batman
[2:24:41] <splinter1619> Batman hits people with the same batarangs that are sharp enough to cut straight through a bell tower rope
[2:24:43] <samuelfisk> That bell was 150 years old
[2:24:46] <Halospaz117> Nah that's a Level Down
[2:24:52] <%patriotrenegade> FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS
[2:24:53] <%spuddnyk> Lvl. 99 Batman: I am the goddamn Batman!
[2:24:58] <leith_aziz> That was a pretty dick move, Bruce
[2:24:58] <Halospaz117> The GodDamn is a limiter
[2:25:00] <+twohitgood> bell drop is from batman 89
[2:25:00] <+GingerStrawhat> When ever Batman gets a Robin in his Car he becomes the Goddamn Batman
[2:25:06] <dinnydanny777> Batman doesn't care about property damage because he's a billionaire

[2:25:30] <Reaganball_Z> That was the original Taco Bell
[2:25:31] <+condemned_15> clues are in the pause screen
[2:25:34] <Torgue_1> Cat and mouse

[2:26:00] <+Hollow_Mirage> Bruce is the only reason this insane asylum functions. Even if it functions poorly
[2:26:01] <randomguy722> @splinter1619 I always wonder how deep his revile of guns goes, I always wondered if Batman ever considered using non lethal guns

[2:33:19] <leith_aziz> GREAT
[2:33:22] <Asuterisuku> The throw is good for crowd control and can knock down multiple enemies, but the takedown is more useful.

[2:43:15] <thefranchise00> *thinking emoji*
[2:43:15] <%Captain_Aham> this took YEARS to find
[2:43:17] <CoffeeShopA> And concept art above
[2:43:17] <Halospaz117> This took actual years for people to find
[2:43:18] <%Seancicle> what was the plan
[2:43:19] <brachydios777> This took 2 years to find
[2:43:20] <Asuterisuku> Remember when Quincy Sharp was talking about his run for becoming Mayor?
[2:43:20] <brunoberserk> 2 YEARS
[2:43:21] <%Feralspirit41> This easter egg was discovered after city was released and the devs had to tell people about it
[2:43:22] <Reaganball_Z> "What if we just made half the city into an insane asylum, though?"
[2:43:22] <Hawkbone_> In the game from day 1, nobody found it so the devs had to leak it themselves
[2:43:24] <%Stupid121v2> this is a bold secret tbh lol
[2:43:25] <%phd_in_thuggery> devs had to leak this cause it was so well hidden
[2:43:25] <peachy996> Rocksteady fucking hid their Sequel Bait better than Fromsoft
[2:43:26] <leith_aziz> Wish more games hinted at sequels like this
[2:43:26] <+AkronymCLT> Can you imagine if they brought out Rikers 2?
[2:43:27] <rytisone> What's next? Arkham World?
[2:43:27] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus This was in the game since launch, but it took like a year or more until people realized it even existed
[2:43:32] <+Crippl3> This was hidden for a very long time after Asylum's release, no one found it until the devs told people about it in an interview
[2:43:34] <%phd_in_thuggery> or they just might have patched it in
[2:43:34] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah the devs had to tell people about this
[2:43:35] <+RiverKing13> Woolie no one ever found this so the devs had to tell everyone after the sequel came out
[2:43:36] <+cicatjb> ya no need for city planning just take blocks of city to make a penitantiary
[2:43:37] <Laironx3> "alroight, keep your secrets"
[2:43:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Teasers are fun like this
[2:43:40] <TheWizardOfWordplay> now get ready for the arkham city boat
[2:43:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Games don't do this anymore
[2:43:42] <$hattrick61> Arkham INFINITE
[2:43:45] <huskarl_zap> What if Arkham society?
[2:43:45] <leith_aziz> The debs hinted at it
[2:43:54] <leith_aziz> I think they leaked it themselves
[2:43:55] <splinter1619> I hope that chat can somehow guide woolie to the equivilant in arkham city
[2:43:55] <peachy996> They do it again in Arkham City for Arkham Knight
[2:43:56] <GilliamYaeger> TWO YEARS
[2:43:57] <%Captain_Aham> 2 YEARS to find
[2:43:59] <thebalticguy1> It was never found until the devs leaked it to the audience
[2:44:01] <+Walopoh> The devs leaked it
[2:44:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Arkham City has teasers for Arkham Knight too
[2:44:11] <%doomerskeletor13> The one in Arkham City is way easier to find though
[2:44:11] <%phd_in_thuggery> DOS A√ëOS
[2:44:18] <Torgue_1> Is Woolie Sanity or Madness?
[2:44:19] <leith_aziz> Really ?
[2:44:20] <dinnydanny777> Arch Ham
[2:44:21] <sunnythedrunk> Gotham City is confusing as fuck though
[2:44:25] <Darren716> It made sense for City at least
[2:44:25] <DatAsuna> And now there actually is Gotham Knights
[2:44:27] <dekkitout> Yeah, but initial alliteration
[2:44:27] <Asuterisuku> It was invisioned as a trilogy to begin with Woolie.
[2:44:29] <%wibbwobbler> batman gotham city tho
[2:44:29] <sunnythedrunk> for trademark purposes
[2:44:30] <+ChancellorOfLights> they probably couldnt develop the whole city
[2:44:32] <%spuddnyk> Gotham Knight would've been a way better name
[2:44:32] <%Double_Tap_That> @Torgue_1 Sadness
[2:44:32] <Darren716> Origins was stupid tho
[2:44:36] <Hawkbone_> The only one it doesn't make sense for is Origins
[2:44:36] <+MagiKestral> there was already a Gotham City Impostors and that game was RADICAL
[2:44:37] <diontmack> batman: arkham from DMC3
[2:44:38] <leith_aziz> I think for Asylum and City it makes sense
[2:44:38] <+Walopoh> Arkham City had a good hidden room for Arkham Knight
[2:44:40] <%phd_in_thuggery> these streams are fun
[2:44:41] <BigBlackBankai> Yup
[2:44:42] <+condemned_15> Arkham Knight or Origins has a tease for Arkham VR in one of the challenge maps
[2:44:42] <puluxor> 101%
[2:44:42] <%Irridium> Yes a trilogy. Asylum, City, and Origins Kappa
[2:44:44] <leith_aziz> Not for Knight really
[2:44:44] <%Captain_Aham> mARK HAMmil
[2:44:45] <sunnythedrunk> Gotham Origins and Gotham Knight is sick tho
[2:44:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> I love how the term for that graphical error is "fighting" they're fighting each other lol
[2:44:45] <%NorthGrizzly> Gothan as a brand was posioned by the shit games
[2:44:46] <+Gohyakuen> knight and origins are dumb names
[2:44:48] <SpartanDumpster> Ya know, honestly, now that I'm thinking about it for more than a couple minutes, the Arkham obsession is a bit much.
[2:44:49] <+evbites> origins had suicide squad
[2:44:49] <+ChancellorOfLights> people would be pissed if they called it Gotham and only had one section
[2:44:56] <%SainEdge> yeah just an easter egg, not "real" content
[2:44:56] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Yeah it's not like a story twist or anything big
[2:44:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Captain_Aham Holy shit mARK HAMill
[2:45:00] <DatAsuna> @spuddnyk that's why the new game ic alled gotham knights lol

[2:45:44] <T_Sasquatch> the arkham knight is totally not the obious person you think it is
[2:45:47] <leith_aziz> Yeah now that I think about it "Origins" Does make sense in context, but with Knight thats NOT the case
[2:45:50] <%doomerskeletor13> ‚ÄúSorry Warden, I had to find an obscure hidden room in your office‚Äù
[2:45:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> @phd_in_thuggery What are you hating?

[2:46:23] <+TheotherKristian> Batman 2
[2:46:27] <SpartanDumpster> It's like "We call him, the Arkham Knight!" "... Why? Does he have some dark history with Arkham Asylum?" "No." "Was he wrongfully placed in Arkham City and it warped him?" "Nope wasn't in either place... we just think the name's cool.
[2:46:32] <randomguy722> @domundomundomun I mean he is a new character, that coincidentally has the same background of other character LUL

[2:46:36] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:46:37] <$emptyantics> Was Origins not made by Rocksteady?

[2:46:44] <+CptBritches> Amazin
[2:46:45] <%krispen_wa> @spartandumpster technucally....
[2:46:47] <kazadaz> nah origins was ubi montreal
[2:46:48] <@Solidus_113> the grapple staggers
[2:46:49] <rytisone> brought batarang to gun fight
[2:46:50] <brachydios777> Bat Ape
[2:46:50] <+evbites> @emptyantics nah wb games
[2:46:51] <thelivingglitch307> @doomerskeletor13 "I don't know what you're talking about" reaches into pocket
[2:46:51] <+traximus_s> YOU FAIL!
[2:46:52] <Asuterisuku> Origins was made by WB Montreal and is not part of the trilogy.
[2:46:53] <Torgue_1> @emptyantics It was not
[2:46:54] <Reaganball_Z> He died in a crane pose
[2:46:58] <%spuddnyk> That does work better in the later games
[2:46:59] <sunnythedrunk> You can maybe take one guy from afara
[2:47:01] <prime_name> Batman can't punch faster than bullets
[2:47:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> basically just a single ranged punch per 'rang
[2:47:03] <TheWizardOfWordplay> origins was made wb montreal
[2:47:04] <%dreadedcthulhu> batman is a leo main now
[2:47:09] <Doctadaking> The rule here is NEVER let gunmen see you
[2:47:10] <%awpickens> IS Origins still worth playing tho?
[2:47:11] <leith_aziz> @emptyantics: No. DIfferent Studio, WB Montreal
[2:47:13] <$hattrick61> Batman's only weakness, many bullets
[2:47:13] <splinter1619> Brute forcing it is easier in late games due to the gadgets you get
[2:47:17] <%doomerskeletor13> @asuterisuku It gets referenced a bunch in Knight
[2:47:18] <splinter1619> Origins is always worth playing
[2:47:18] <peachy996> Origins is worth playing
[2:47:24] <user_naim> Origins is good, it is known
[2:47:25] <%SainEdge> @awpickens yeah totally
[2:47:26] <SpartanDumpster> @krispen_wa I'll admit it's been years since I've played Arkham Knight, but knowing what I know, the name seemed like a stretch.
[2:47:28] <kazadaz> origins has problems but its fun enough
[2:47:28] <splinter1619> Even if for just the first boss fight
[2:47:30] <leith_aziz> I think Origins is worth giving a shot
[2:47:30] <%mundanelotus> blasted
[2:47:31] <%CptnCampy61> When they‚Äôre not looking or if you have a combo going
[2:47:31] <+Gohyakuen> origins is pretty good
[2:47:35] <%spuddnyk> @awpickens Only if you really want an Arkham fix. It's not horrible, just not great
[2:47:36] <@Solidus_113> pixel
[2:47:37] <TheWizardOfWordplay> just stealth him
[2:47:37] <@Menitta> I like Origins the most tbh
[2:47:38] <dinnydanny777> I hope Batman sets off the Metal detector
[2:47:38] <+DomunDomunDomun> Just stealth takedown.
[2:47:39] <%doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs me, the Arkham Origins defender
[2:47:40] <Asuterisuku> @doomerskeletor13 Knight also retcons a bunch of what it does; enough to consider it non-canon for the most part.
[2:47:41] <dukenux> BULLETS! My only weakness
[2:47:41] <leith_aziz> For the boss fights and Bane alone
[2:47:46] <Yung_FckUp> 1 hp
[2:47:50] <Banedain> Origins has the best wtiting
[2:47:50] <Doctadaking> AH
[2:47:50] <+Gohyakuen> origins bane is the best bane
[2:47:51] <+condemned_15> origins has fun moments that's worth the LP
[2:47:54] <T_Sasquatch> origins is the one i played the most and people hate it LUL
[2:47:55] <+Walopoh> I like City the most
[2:47:55] <leith_aziz> Bane is so good in Origins
[2:47:56] <Hawkbone_> I'm choking you, idiot
[2:47:58] <Chester_goes_Berserk> I'm walkin' over here
[2:48:00] <kazadaz> eh, you can get away with small fuckups in the more open-ended rooms
[2:48:00] <peachy996> The worse thing you can say about Origins is it's just Arkham City but in a snowy Gotham
[2:48:02] <%phd_in_thuggery> magic pixel
[2:48:07] <leith_aziz> At least compared to other Arkham games
[2:48:07] <%rottingpastry> yeah, woolie, cut him down
[2:48:11] <EnvyLeviathan_> city is the BEST
[2:48:12] <+GenesisKnight> Guns = bad

[2:48:48] <%awpickens> @BurncoatRapscallion I really enjoyed Knight but the criticism about the overuse of the bat-tank is valid.

[2:48:55] <leith_aziz> Arkham Knight is a very Diversive game in the franchise
[2:48:55] <marrowjuice> god, i hate this harley design
[2:48:56] <%aurasviel> It was worth is Harley blew a kiss at us
[2:48:58] <user_naim> QUI GONN JIN TAUGHT ME
[2:48:59] <brunoberserk> i feel woolie never gonna learn how to play this game
[2:49:02] <BigBlackBankai> Correct
[2:49:03] <leith_aziz> People either like it or hate it
[2:49:10] <Doctadaking> Drop a little bit further behind him this time
[2:49:17] <SpartanDumpster> I think the main thing I didn't like about Arkham Knight was how much they forced you to use the Batmobile. I think it was the kind of thing that's better as an optional thing to have fun with.
[2:49:17] <dukenux> yeah this Harley didnt age well
[2:49:17] <leith_aziz> I think I like it, but I have alot of issues with it
[2:49:18] <BlackermanZX> you need more gadgets woolz
[2:49:23] <kazadaz> Just glide ddown and land behind em man
[2:49:26] <waffleandman> knight isnt bad its just stupid
[2:49:29] <$genocidal_cupcake> just do a silent takedown
[2:49:30] <PanicSwytch> Drop down and quiet takedown
[2:49:30] <rytisone> like Mario
[2:49:33] <dundore77> you can silent drop down
[2:49:33] <kazadaz> Land behind him man!
[2:49:34] <Lancaster_H> wait how is he still in this room theyre literally all looking in the same direction 10 feet apart
[2:49:35] <kazataca> Wools you can do takedown from corners and railings too
[2:49:38] <Hawkbone_> Why not land behind him?
[2:49:40] <EnvyLeviathan_> is woolie going to play city?
[2:49:41] <randomguy722> Arkham city was the only game that I managed to go through, for some reason I never liked playing these games. I uninstalled Knigjt when the armor cutscene ended
[2:49:42] <leith_aziz> The Batmobile is a BIG issue for me. Just how often its used for everything
[2:49:43] <+evbites> @awpickens i don't like the post ending goon dialogue and the lack of changing characters in freemode
[2:49:45] <chili_nobeans> the gargoyle business went downhill after Arkham was finished
[2:49:49] <Asuterisuku> Dare you to walk through the metal detector
[2:49:50] <leith_aziz> Puzzles, bossfights, etc
[2:49:51] <%Stupid121v2> I got the ultimate edition of Knight for like $10 so I thought it was more than fine lol
[2:49:52] <peachy996> Ninja
[2:49:52] <$emptyantics> Origins had the best Boss Fights
[2:49:55] <Jaysky> Knight I didn't like how much they tried to cram the batmobile into it
[2:49:56] <%Javaa01> These guards are VERY blind
[2:49:56] <+DizzyGunner> the worst part about knight was the reveal of who the arkham knight is, everyone knew it well before the game released
[2:49:58] <splinter1619> Literal tunnel visio
[2:50:00] <%ThatGuyThere03> vision cones amirite?
[2:50:02] <splinter1619> vision*
[2:50:06] <SpartanDumpster> I think Woolie's been overestimating these guy's listening abilities and vision.
[2:50:07] <thelivingglitch307> you can to drop attack by doing the ground takedown command while falling
[2:50:10] <+ChancellorOfLights> staring at a wall
[2:50:10] <+the_vedo_show> ded
[2:50:14] <Jaysky> @emptyantics Yep. Origins had some really good moments but it's the most buggy of them
[2:50:17] <peachy996> The League of Shadows got nothing on yo
[2:50:20] <%MooseIsGoose> You are over thinking the stealth stuff every thing else you are good. You got this man.
[2:50:24] <phantalime> tbh knight is like 50% better if you switch batmobile to toggle mode
[2:50:25] <PMda2nd> billion dollar dream
[2:50:31] <%aurasviel> These guards the kinda mfs to think nothing of cardboard box out of nowhete
[2:50:32] <Asuterisuku> Oh no the Goblins
[2:50:32] <leith_aziz> @DizzyGunner: Yeah, but im talking if you think past that there are other issues

[2:50:35] <dinnydanny777> does the metal detector work?

[2:50:42] <%saladin1911> I really enjoyed the Batmobile in Knight tbh. Don't really see why people hate it so much.
[2:50:43] <%rottingpastry> The tank is awful, but yes, it's nearly unplayable if the tank is in hold mode

[2:52:35] <%X2Eliah> @user_naim truth
[2:52:36] <%Josef_Stryker> They also did that in Brave and the Bold

[2:52:37] <+cicatjb> but wouldn't joker hate that? its no fun for him when he wins permeneantly
[2:52:39] <huskarl_zap> "The society must flow" Emperor Jared Leto the 2nd the Joker
[2:52:44] <Asuterisuku> I wonder where the trail went.
[2:52:46] <+skyheys> correct
[2:52:46] <Komayeda> It's pronounced Raysh
[2:52:47] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @silverinferno3 yes he's the anti-Batman
[2:52:49] <leith_aziz> @SilverInferno3: Yes. Theres a reference to him in this game
[2:52:49] <Hawkbone_> @SilverDevilfish Yes, he's actually a riddle solution in this game
[2:52:52] <%doomerskeletor13> I think it was Bat Mite
[2:52:53] <+evbites> @cicatjb he got bored and gave up
[2:52:54] <unthought> mispronounced, but understandble.
[2:53:02] <mortificent> Mr. Myxlpx is the worst
[2:53:03] <TheWizardOfWordplay> don't worry everyone pronounces that wrong
[2:53:05] <%jinking79> comics had Batman memories erased of the deaths
[2:53:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Or maybe that was just the Brave and The Bold episode
[2:53:09] <+traximus_s> I heard superman took batman traumatic memorys
[2:53:12] <Komayeda> It was Bat Mite in Brave in the Bold, Myxlpykt was the comic one
[2:53:14] <peachy996> Mr. M has a weird name
[2:53:18] <BlackermanZX> ya need remote or twin
[2:53:20] <Indigo_Automaton> Later games have those
[2:53:22] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Also Darkseid losing his shit cause he thinks Joker got access to the anti life equation
[2:53:22] <samuelfisk> Cicatjb. He does end up bored. Then he tries to destroy the universe before Superman stops him.
[2:53:23] <+cicatjb> @cicatjb figured as much with a villain like this
[2:53:24] <+SilverInferno3> @Dante_Namikaze1 @leith_aziz Neat, thanks!
[2:53:27] <+Walopoh> Armor 100%
[2:53:43] <mortificent> yeah Emperor Joker was a Superman comic iirc
[2:53:46] <blues_roach> mr. m was just gonna give him 1% of his power to see what happens but accidentally gave him 99%
[2:53:50] <Hawkbone_> Make batman throw harder
[2:53:55] <peachy996> Sonic Batarang Helps in harder Predator Rooms
[2:53:58] <%rottingpastry> Mr. Mxyzptlk
[2:54:04] <leith_aziz> DC Prometheus is basically a dark reflection of Batman. His parents were killed by Gangsters and now Prometheus hunts down criminals and kills them (I think, im not too sure about this fact)
[2:54:04] <Banedain> Armor for tough bods
[2:54:05] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Sonic is great. All the gadgets are great
[2:54:11] <+Hollow_Mirage> All of DCs Quirky Infinite Cosmic power characters are pretty bad
[2:54:11] <TheWizardOfWordplay> your going to get a new gadget soon keep that in mind
[2:54:14] <BlackermanZX> both the sonic and the remote are for stealth
[2:54:14] <+Walopoh> Superman must be so much lamer to fight for Joker
[2:54:34] <%Javaa01> Faster yes, but you can take down 3 people at once
[2:54:34] <+MagiKestral> there's a quick placement in City that feels so good to pull ogf
[2:54:37] <+zepelinnn1> sonic is literally 'what was that noise'
[2:54:43] <CrematedCube> The proxy bomb is practically a downgrade
[2:54:44] <+0neReeler> set trap, lure
[2:54:50] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You can spray the gel after knocking someone out, because you know they'll check the body

[2:55:04] <@akuda_bar> YEET
[2:55:04] <BigBlackBankai> The gel is so good tho
[2:55:07] <DomonTrigger> Chilling out with the crew
[2:55:13] <%saladin1911> Batman doesn't have Snatch, Woolie LUL
[2:55:14] <+samuraiknack> Prometheus parents were criminals kilked by cops
[2:55:17] <CrematedCube> The manual triggered bomb is more useful
[2:55:19] <+heyitsdenzel_> they were just getting some air
[2:55:26] <dinnydanny777> Look out he's dual wielding cutlery limesD
[2:55:33] <thebalticguy1> not fast enough
[2:55:34] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @silverinferno3 except this one literally is just an antibatman like his pants were criminals and got killed and stuff like that
[2:55:36] <Doctadaking> Don‚Äôt forget flipping over dudes
[2:55:36] <SheefEatsBeef> too slow maybe
[2:55:43] <peachy996> The evade jump works on Knife boys
[2:55:48] <peachy996> And everybody
[2:55:51] <%awpickens> remember the hit 100x combo hallway at the end?
[2:55:55] <devanmuse> doing that to someone over a ledge is always fun
[2:55:55] <leith_aziz> @SilverInferno3: Red hood should be the only one in my opinon, since he does this the best
[2:55:56] <@Solidus_113> you don't need the prompt for the takedowns iirc, as long as you have the combo for it
[2:55:59] <Doctadaking> No
[2:56:01] <Jaysky> The jump extends combos
[2:56:02] <deviljhojho_> if you jump over them no
[2:56:03] <+sevorai> its doesn't
[2:56:06] <+0neReeler> did they ever add granular indicators? (perfect, great, poor, bad [slow])
[2:56:11] <Asuterisuku> A single dodge roll does not break the combo. A second will, though.
[2:56:12] <dundore77> if you go too long without hitting yes
[2:56:13] <+zepelinnn1> NO
[2:56:13] <deviljhojho_> also the punch jump that you do automatically doesnt do it
[2:56:13] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It doesn't
[2:56:13] <CanadianAdam> hitting a blocking enemy breaks the combo
[2:56:14] <%rottingpastry> dodge doesn't break combo
[2:56:15] <thebalticguy1> The evade only breaks if you do it twice without offense
[2:56:15] <BlackermanZX> It doesnt
[2:56:16] <peachy996> It didn't
[2:56:16] <Doctadaking> No, you were just late
[2:56:17] <+ja07sj> woolie no
[2:56:17] <Hawkbone_> Nope
[2:56:18] <+Mr_Pylon> nope
[2:56:18] <Jaysky> Jumps do not break combos
[2:56:18] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> the evade and vault does not break the combo
[2:56:18] <TheWizardOfWordplay> jumps fine hitting knife guys breaks it
[2:56:18] <sunnythedrunk> It doesn't
[2:56:21] <+PikeBot> It doesn't break the combo as long as you're dodging over an nemy. YOu can get one on the ground without breaking combo
[2:56:22] <$genocidal_cupcake> It doesnt, you waited too long
[2:56:22] <peachy996> You were late
[2:56:22] <+SilverInferno3> @Dante_Namikaze1 Damn dastardly pants, probably had it coming tbh
[2:56:23] <MF_Alf> Countering with Y cancels animations so you don't have to worry about dropping combos
[2:56:24] <Banedain> It extends combos
[2:56:24] <wujak> it doesnt. that combo timed out before you did it
[2:56:24] <+condemned_15> It didn't.
[2:56:24] <brunoberserk> dont break
[2:56:25] <CrematedCube> It doesn't, bad timing
[2:56:26] <+mathluciano_> It doesn't
[2:56:30] <NeoseekerStitch> taking half a second before punching somehting else does
[2:56:30] <mankeymania> you waited too long
[2:56:32] <LordOfThePoultry> it doesnt you're just slow
[2:56:32] <ashenjuan25> It‚Äôs a Rhythm game woolie think of it like that
[2:56:34] <+Crippl3> It doesn't, you just took too long
[2:56:34] <%CptnCampy61> It doesn‚Äôt you paused
[2:56:37] <leith_aziz> Though I dont think Prometheus ever acts like a good guy. He just killls criminals and theres not much to it'
[2:56:38] <El_Rabbit> Evading doesn't break the combo
[2:56:40] <Indigo_Automaton> Whiffing Punches, Parries, or taking damage breaks combo
[2:56:41] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @silverinferno3 they super did
[2:56:42] <ashenjuan25> It doesn‚Äôt you‚Äôre not fast enough
[2:56:43] <+Troispoint> Arkham Asylum's combat is harder than the sequels iirc
[2:56:44] <user_naim> It doesnt break the combo, you‚Äôre just waiting too long
[2:56:44] <thebalticguy1> Its a rhythm game
[2:56:46] <+ja07sj> he should try the trials
[2:56:46] <kazataca> It doesnt, just dont take too long
[2:56:47] <%Irridium> y'all LUL
[2:56:50] <+JacknZack27> It doesnt break the combo
[2:56:52] <dinnydanny777> That guy looked like his neck snapped
[2:56:52] <Lancaster_H> dodge does not break combo
[2:56:56] <%mundanelotus> taking too long
[2:56:57] <leith_aziz> Unlike Red Hood who thinks this is the best choice
[2:56:58] <Komayeda> Okay, so Red Lines mean he's attacking, doesn't mean that's when you stun
[2:57:00] <+condemned_15> just drop your shield
[2:57:02] <Hawkbone_> What is it with Woolie and constantly making wrong assumptions? NotLikeThis
[2:57:03] <Jaysky> Jumping doesn't break the combo
[2:57:08] <TheWizardOfWordplay> don't worry arkham city improves combat like crazy
[2:57:11] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @WoolieVersus I think you are miss understanding how the knife thugs work. You cant hit them at all unless they are stunned
[2:57:15] <brunoberserk> dodges dont break the combo if you are fast
[2:57:17] <+nomad390> Fighting games
[2:57:17] <+SolidusRex> YOU'RE TOO SLOWWWW
[2:57:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Damie904
[2:57:21] <thelivingglitch307> 2 jump break the combo
[2:57:23] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Knife enemies block attacks by default if you don't cape them first, blocked attacks kill the combo
[2:57:27] <Clundy> I want a Batman DDR game
[2:57:28] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> @Hawkbone_ Wrong for who?
[2:57:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the combo just ends really fast, and if you whiff
[2:57:30] <+Gohyakuen> do it faster, like a bat
[2:57:30] <BlackermanZX> if you take too long it just drops @WoolieVersus
[2:57:32] <randomguy722> I always hated the combat in this game, it feels so mediocre and poorly implemented
[2:57:33] <%mundanelotus> you are committed to a punch
[2:57:33] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus as your combo speeds up your combo time shortens, meaning you can't be walking inbetween
[2:57:34] <+0neReeler> more rhythm less fighting, too slow breaks the chain
[2:57:35] <Doctadaking> Pat said he preferred this combat to the sequels. Further proof that he‚Äôs insane
[2:57:35] <deviljhojho_> whiffing or pausing or countering when you dont have to breaks the combo. Square mashing is actually solid enough most of the time
[2:57:36] <masterfire23> dodge offensively then
[2:57:37] <+zepelinnn1> you dont commit, the counter is a roman cancel
[2:57:37] <+Damie904> Redlines mean uncounterable attack, not stun window
[2:57:38] <@Menitta> Batman Dance Mix
[2:57:41] <leith_aziz> I dont know how to help Woolie. I adapt quickly no matter the game
[2:57:43] <PanicSwytch> Don't jump constantly
[2:57:43] <Hawkbone_> The devs literally call it a rhythm game
[2:57:44] <Banedain> You can spam dodge over enemies to extend combos infinitely
[2:57:46] <user_naim> I mean you clearly don‚Äôt understand something here.
[2:57:46] <@Menitta> its not rhythm.
[2:57:46] <+JacknZack27> You cant hit knife guys at all unless you cape stun them
[2:57:46] <radar410> You're just meant to press the button right after hitting someone, not mash it LUL
[2:57:47] <+Gohyakuen> it literally is though
[2:57:48] <brachydios777> Chat is going nuts
[2:57:49] <%Stupid121v2> Oh yeah knife boys MUST be stunned to hit
[2:57:51] <user_naim> Just react to shit
[2:57:52] <EcchiMichael> I say you should stop trying to time your attacks and just start mashing X.
[2:57:55] <%rottingpastry> the rhythm is for crit strikes
[2:57:59] <+zepelinnn1> the counters is an instant cancel, even mid punch
[2:57:59] <ashenjuan25> Also I think hitting knife dudes can be hit if you‚Äôre behind them or at least in other games
[2:58:02] <+DizzyGunner> someone who pulls of all those virgil combos, can't get used to batman LUL
[2:58:07] <+allups> sayig it rythem is just buz words everyone used during this games press is all
[2:58:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> The counter cancels your attack no matter what right?
[2:58:10] <wujak> stun isnt to counter red attacks. red attacks are just uncounterable
[2:58:12] <peachy996> You will be punished for mashing in later fights
[2:58:13] <@Menitta> Its rhythm if music was purely visual
[2:58:18] <%CptnCampy61> It‚Äôs rhythm and Rock Paper Scissors with different enemies
[2:58:19] <Darren716> No
[2:58:20] <Clundy> DDR Batman Megamix 3
[2:58:20] <@Menitta> So it isnt
[2:58:21] <Manmush> its never enough
[2:58:22] <dundore77> You dont have to be super big on the combos and variety in fights the exp is still enough to beat the game
[2:58:22] <%Javaa01> Gotta go back to the breadcrumb trail
[2:58:22] <Asuterisuku> You've gotten a couple of pretty smooth combos.
[2:58:23] <thebalticguy1> Red lightning symbolizes uncounterable, but you must always stun knife users before attacking them
[2:58:23] <peachy996> It's okay Woolie, You'll figure it out
[2:58:27] <TallPixels> You have 3/4 games to get used to it
[2:58:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Everyone sucks until you start the trials
[2:58:29] <Yung_FckUp> the fighting gets more crisp in city
[2:58:30] <user_naim> How did someone email Woolie a riddler guide, but no one has taught him combat
[2:58:32] <Bigyanno> You suck for now, but nobody sucks forever
[2:58:32] <Doctadaking> Yeah, you kinda wandered over here
[2:58:33] <%krispen_wa> Arkham is a PICKLE STONE game
[2:58:33] <SheefEatsBeef> you don't suck mr wools it's just not optimal
[2:58:37] <TheWizardOfWordplay> by the time he's at arkham knight he'll be a master. hopefully
[2:58:40] <+ChancellorOfLights> does it improve the mindset if we call it "combat flow" rather than "rhythm"?
[2:58:40] <unthought> Batman Will Figure It Out
[2:58:42] <deviljhojho_> DMC combos are hard to pull off and complicated so he'll get there
[2:58:43] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:58:43] <leith_aziz> Like your priority is attacking goons. When no one's attaking, YOU attack. if someone's trying to attack try to counter
[2:58:44] <+0neReeler> iirc attack in rhythm but counter takes priority
[2:58:47] <+ApollyonAOD> @WoolieVersus You also want to get to 8x combo to get auto takedowns to make your life easier re. blade guys
[2:58:49] <wujak> no
[2:58:49] <Indigo_Automaton> No it isn't
[2:58:50] <leith_aziz> I guess ?
[2:58:51] <@Solidus_113> the red can't be countered
[2:58:51] <kazadaz> nah
[2:58:52] <Lancaster_H> B is NOT A COUNTER
[2:58:53] <+DizzyGunner> no
[2:58:54] <+CptBritches> ?
[2:58:54] <dinnydanny777> Stun or dodge over them
[2:58:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> No it's not
[2:58:55] <Wild_Samurai> The fighting of all 3 games including this one is perfect. Fight me!
[2:58:55] <thebalticguy1> No it isnt
[2:58:55] <+zepelinnn1> negative
[2:58:55] <%krispen_wa> B IS NOT COUNTER
[2:58:55] <Doctadaking> B isn‚Äôt a counter.
[2:58:55] <leith_aziz> Not really
[2:58:55] <+Birdro> Stun is not a counter, it's just interrupting them
[2:58:56] <%Feralspirit41> The combat in the arkham series takes a while to get good at it. But once you get the feel and get into the rhythm you never forget it
[2:58:56] <Asuterisuku> B is a stun, not a specific counter.
[2:58:56] <%X2Eliah> ?
[2:58:56] <+0neReeler> red it unblockable
[2:58:57] <+SolidusRex> NO
[2:58:58] <+condemned_15> red is not counter
[2:58:59] <El_Rabbit> B button is to stun
[2:59:00] <+SilverInferno3> Stunning doesnt really mean counter
[2:59:00] <leith_aziz> He can hiot you
[2:59:00] <+Gohyakuen> who said that? one guy?
[2:59:00] <%krispen_wa> B IS STUN AT ALL TIMES
[2:59:00] <+PikeBot> No, woolie. B doesn't do a counter, it just stuns. It stuns any enemy.
[2:59:00] <%X2Eliah> what
[2:59:01] <%Dante_Namikaze1> b is not a counter
[2:59:02] <%Stupid121v2> B is a stun
[2:59:03] <CrematedCube> Incorrect
[2:59:03] <%Feralspirit41> B is a stun
[2:59:03] <%X2Eliah> lol no
[2:59:03] <$priceyyeti40> What?
[2:59:03] <Hawkbone_> Stun is not a Counter
[2:59:04] <user_naim> No
[2:59:04] <@Solidus_113> B is stun
[2:59:05] <+allups> the B is stun
[2:59:05] <Indigo_Automaton> B is stun
[2:59:05] <+Hollow_Mirage> NotLikeThis
[2:59:05] <%rottingpastry> red attacks are uncounterable. sometimes you hit the stun before their attack hits
[2:59:05] <+zepelinnn1> its a stun
[2:59:05] <sunnythedrunk> B is a stun
[2:59:06] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @WoolieVersus thats not how it works
[2:59:06] <CoffeeShopA> No that‚Äôs not true
[2:59:06] <+DizzyGunner> it's a stun
[2:59:06] <@Menitta> B is stun
[2:59:06] <Lancaster_H> it just stuns
[2:59:07] <Bigyanno> B is a STUN
[2:59:07] <BlackermanZX> its just a stun
[2:59:08] <thebalticguy1> B is a stun
[2:59:09] <+sevorai> B is a STUN
[2:59:10] <$emptyantics> B IS A STUN
[2:59:11] <a1rfighter> B is a stun not a counter
[2:59:11] <user_naim> No that is incorrect Woolie
[2:59:12] <wujak> you stun knife people, but it isnt to counter the attack
[2:59:12] <+allups> yes
[2:59:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:59:13] <%NorthGrizzly> Woolie you so overthinking actually taking alot of fun of the game
[2:59:14] <%doomerskeletor13> B is just stun yeah
[2:59:14] <kazadaz> B is stun, to be done proactively
[2:59:14] <+SolidusRex> B IS STUN
[2:59:16] <%mundanelotus> it doesn't stun knife users in attack
[2:59:16] <Hawkbone_> Its a stun button, woolie
[2:59:16] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus you can try the combat challenges to learn more
[2:59:16] <+allups> but that is a stun
[2:59:17] <%Dante_Namikaze1> b is stun
[2:59:17] <%dreadedcthulhu> universe is loud today
[2:59:17] <%krispen_wa> YEAH, BUT YOU CAN USE B ANYTIME
[2:59:17] <leith_aziz> The stun lets you attck them
[2:59:19] <sunnythedrunk> B just beats knife guys
[2:59:20] <filialpails> stun doesn't do damage
[2:59:21] <+Birdro> Stun is a good answer, it's not specific to red signals though
[2:59:22] <dundore77> red is dodge
[2:59:22] <%Feralspirit41> B is a stun and Y is counter
[2:59:23] <SwerveBootyHammer> you can stun anytime
[2:59:24] <+SilverInferno3> They can overlap uses but theyre different moves
[2:59:26] <splinter1619> Red means its uncounterable, those enemies can only be damaged when you stun them
[2:59:26] <Asuterisuku> The tutorial said when they have a KNIFE you have to stun before striking.
[2:59:26] <TallPixels> red just means dodge
[2:59:29] <kazataca> Its unblockable by counter
[2:59:29] <ajmgamesdev> Red cannot be countered
[2:59:29] <CrematedCube> B is a guard break
[2:59:30] <leith_aziz> But Red is basically "Unblockable"
[2:59:31] <splinter1619> You can stun them at any time
[2:59:31] <PanicSwytch> Y is counter, B is stun
[2:59:31] <dinnydanny777> You can't hit them without using the cape
[2:59:33] <+Damie904> Red means you cant counter them, it's not a window for you to do something.
[2:59:33] <BlackermanZX> nah its just stun
[2:59:36] <%doomerskeletor13> The knife guys need to be stunned
[2:59:37] <Onamar> B is a stun, it's not the only response to red attacks
[2:59:37] <+0neReeler> 360
[2:59:37] <+JacknZack27> Thats stun
[2:59:37] <thebalticguy1> Knife wielders must be stunned before attacking them. B is a stun
[2:59:38] <sunnythedrunk> B doesn't counter it just beats the nife guys
[2:59:39] <%mundanelotus> awesome
[2:59:40] <+DizzyGunner> you just need to stun the knife guy other wise they will block
[2:59:44] <user_naim> No, red is dodge. You just have to stun those guys before you hit
[2:59:45] <$emptyantics> Red arrows means its un counterable
[2:59:51] <HollowMan190> what a food game
[2:59:53] <+allups> u are correct
[2:59:53] <+darkharpinger> B is not a hard counter like Y. if you get it in a time frame it stops the attack.
[2:59:54] <+CptBritches> It is, bbut that's not a counter
[2:59:54] <+Gohyakuen> well you can use it
[2:59:54] <Darren716> Yes
[2:59:58] <brachydios777> Yes
[2:59:59] <PanicSwytch> YES
[2:59:59] <anAngryHamster> Woolie loves coming to conclusions with zero evidence and living by them
[3:00:01] <%mundanelotus> red means not counterable
[3:00:02] <+Gohyakuen> but you can also dodge
[3:00:03] <kazataca> Red is dodge or stun
[3:00:03] <+allups> u called it a counter tho
[3:00:03] <wujak> you need to stun red people to attack them, but stun is not to counter their attack
[3:00:03] <%Javaa01> Yes, but you can do the stun without the red arrows being there
[3:00:04] <Darren716> Woolie you are massively over thinking this
[3:00:04] <mudamudajo> No, B is a stun NOT counter. Only red guys need to be stunned to attack them.
[3:00:04] <+mathluciano_> you could try the challenge mode to train
[3:00:06] <+CptBritches> You called it a counter
[3:00:07] <Wild_Samurai> DAMMIT WOOLIE
[3:00:08] <splinter1619> Stun is the only way to damage them, but its not a counter to that
[3:00:08] <%X2Eliah> Yes but it's not "a counter", you can stun anyone
[3:00:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @user_naim
[3:00:10] <+SilverInferno3> Basically, red means dont hit Y, best to dodge
[3:00:11] <El_Rabbit> Red means ypu can't counter
[3:00:11] <Lancaster_H> red knife dudes block unless you stun them. you can stun them any time, no need to wait for the red arrows @WoolieVersus
[3:00:12] <$priceyyeti40> Then by that logic the Y button is blue?
[3:00:13] <sunnythedrunk> Yes but B isn't a counter, it's a beat all
[3:00:15] <mankeymania> city, origin, and knight help with that
[3:00:15] <leith_aziz> Yes
[3:00:17] <splinter1619> YES
[3:00:18] <LordOfThePoultry> red = cannot counter
[3:00:21] <peachy996> Woolie you're overthinking and underthinking the combat at the same time. It's weird. I'm not even mad I'm just confused
[3:00:23] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @WoolieVersus Red means you cant counter. The knife enemies cant be attacked unless you stun them first.
[3:00:23] <%X2Eliah> omg
[3:00:25] <sunnythedrunk> OMG
[3:00:26] <kazadaz> YEAH, u got it
[3:00:26] <BlackermanZX> not necessarily because you can dodge or stun @WoolieVersus
[3:00:26] <+SilverInferno3> Dodge is safer
[3:00:27] <leith_aziz> Stun knife enemies
[3:00:29] <+0neReeler> dodge or stun
[3:00:34] <Onamar> OR DODGE
[3:00:34] <kazataca> Dodge or stun
[3:00:34] <rytisone> well, stun also works, to be fair
[3:00:37] <+CptBritches> But you called it a counter
[3:00:37] <leith_aziz> And dodge Stick enemies
[3:00:37] <+Gohyakuen> stun or dodge
[3:00:38] <PanicSwytch> Dodge and stun red
[3:00:39] <Asuterisuku> You can stun them if you get it before their active frames.
[3:00:39] <splinter1619> You can stun them at any time tho
[3:00:41] <+allups> yes
[3:00:42] <%mundanelotus> you can as long as they're not atacking
[3:00:42] <brachydios777> Yes
[3:00:42] <+SilverInferno3> You dont *have* to stun
[3:00:42] <kazadaz> stun at any time
[3:00:43] <BlackermanZX> or both LUL
[3:00:44] <dundore77> red means dodge but stun does stop the attack but the combo drop?
[3:00:47] <FennecZephyr> No, the only incorrect information was that you called the cape stun a counter @WoolieVersus
[3:00:47] <splinter1619> You dont have to stun them during that red window
[3:00:47] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus Jumping over them will enlongate your combo moree than a stun
[3:00:49] <%rottingpastry> red attack indicator = uncounterable. red attack enemies often require stun to be hit (really knife users)
[3:00:49] <+allups> woolie u get it. chat is just bugging u
[3:00:50] <%bearwagon> is this just a semantic issue
[3:00:50] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Red enemies are just straight up bad for combos.
[3:00:50] <+zepelinnn1> sure, but its not damage, and not a counter
[3:00:50] <Banedain> Yes
[3:00:51] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you can stun at any time regardless of attack
[3:00:51] <%dreadedcthulhu> They're trying to say you can stun at any point in a combonnot just in response to red
[3:00:52] <@Solidus_113> Knife enemies have to be stunned to be opened up to attacks, otherwise they block everything
[3:00:53] <+PikeBot> Stunning works but it doesn't increase your counter or do damage.
[3:00:54] <+SilverInferno3> If you jump over them its safer
[3:00:55] <brian_peppers1> Not really
[3:00:56] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[3:00:57] <CrematedCube> It's two mechanics side-by-side
[3:00:57] <leith_aziz> You can do a takedown but you need the combo meter
[3:00:57] <Lancaster_H> you can do it ANYTIME you dont need to see the RED
[3:00:59] <sunnythedrunk> Chat sucks
[3:00:59] <wujak> its two different mechanics for the red enemies.
[3:00:59] <brachydios777> Stun or doge
[3:01:00] <+Birdro> Stunning isn't tied to their attacks is the point, stun them in neutral
[3:01:01] <Hawkbone_> But its not a counter
[3:01:01] <splinter1619> You dont have to see the red window
[3:01:02] <Asuterisuku> It's a soft counter rather than a hard one.
[3:01:02] <brunoberserk> yes
[3:01:02] <kazataca> Or zipline, or batarang
[3:01:03] <BigBlackBankai> Cape for knives jump behind for batons both are red
[3:01:03] <Themagicpillow> Jump over and hit them in the back
[3:01:03] <Reaganball_Z> Joker's making him read superchats
[3:01:05] <El_Rabbit> You can always stun enemies
[3:01:06] <%krispen_wa> Yes, but it ISN'T a counter
[3:01:06] <splinter1619> You can stun them at any time
[3:01:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> do not stun them during the red highlight window is the point, dodge during the red highlight. stun 99% of the time otherwise
[3:01:06] <Onamar> You can get hit out of the stun unlike a counter
[3:01:07] <+allups> yeah
[3:01:08] <Manmush> what is chat going on about?
[3:01:10] <Wild_Samurai> No. Just Dodge if they show the red
[3:01:10] <Bigyanno> Yes it is A POSSIBLE correct action
[3:01:11] <%Javaa01> Seeing the red is not necessary for the stun to work
[3:01:11] <thebalticguy1> Regardless of their attack state knife users must be stunned before attacking or else they block
[3:01:11] <BlackermanZX> dodging doesn't drop it
[3:01:12] <+SilverInferno3> Dodging doesnt reset combo counter tho
[3:01:13] <+Gohyakuen> dodge doesn't drop combo
[3:01:13] <Doctadaking> Dodging over guys keeps the combo going
[3:01:14] <user_naim> Stun on offense, Dodge on defense
[3:01:14] <%X2Eliah> YOU CCAN STUN RED ENEMIES WITHOUT WAITING FOR THEM TO ATTACK
[3:01:15] <dundore77> doge keeps the counter unless you dodge multiple times
[3:01:15] <Banedain> Only if ur quick enough to interupt
[3:01:15] <+sevorai> Dodging won't drop your combo @WoolieVersus
[3:01:16] <JayEarly> stun doesn‚Äôt drop combos
[3:01:17] <Nightwingie> kabajiHmm
[3:01:18] <Jaysky> If you use an action after the dodge it keeps the combo going
[3:01:19] <PanicSwytch> Don't call it a counter
[3:01:19] <+skyheys> the dodge keeps the combo going
[3:01:19] <CoffeeShopA> You do not need to stun when the red lines come up is point
[3:01:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> No, because B doesn't stop their attack necessarily
[3:01:20] <Indigo_Automaton> Stun can be used whenever, Knife enemies must be stunned to be beaten
[3:01:23] <Yung_FckUp> dodging keeps your combo
[3:01:24] <TallPixels> dodging doesn't drop the combo. it's timed
[3:01:26] <heart_ablaze> you dodge when they attack, stun before you attack
[3:01:29] <Bigyanno> Woolie is not wrong, but also somewhat wrong
[3:01:32] <leith_aziz> Defense: Dodge, Offense: Stun
[3:01:33] <+Reverend_Roscoe> no
[3:01:33] <+allups> Reggie woolie got it fuck the chatters
[3:01:35] <SpartanDumpster> @WoolieVersus pressing B is less of a counter, it's more like the red is usually a sign that you should stun them to fight them.
[3:01:35] <%SainEdge> dont limit yourself by waiting for the knifeguys to attack, you can stun them anytime
[3:01:37] <ashenjuan25> IT DOES NOT DROP THE COMBO
[3:01:37] <J2m0ftw> man city was such a better game
[3:01:37] <%Feralspirit41> Youre half right. The guys who do the red attacks have to be stunned before you can actually attack them
[3:01:38] <+dranok_x> Dodte does not break combo
[3:01:41] <Lancaster_H> you dont need to see the red to stun them, stun always works its not a counter-like @WoolieVersus
[3:01:44] <CoffeeShopA> But you must stun the knife users to deal damage to them
[3:01:47] <ashenjuan25> YOU JUST WAITED TOO LONG
[3:01:50] <splinter1619> They must be gaurd broken to be able to be hit
[3:01:50] <+mathluciano_> the game recommends stun the knife enemies because they can block your attacks
[3:01:50] <puluxor> Tutorial sucked asakuraLook
[3:01:52] <T_Sasquatch> too MANY COOKS, TOOO MANY COOKSS
[3:01:52] <%doomerskeletor13> The difference is that knife enemies need to be stunned, the red appears when they throw objects too, and you have to dodge those
[3:01:54] <kazadaz> No, just stun them whenever
[3:01:56] <mudamudajo> You can do that. But, its to just start of with a cape stun to the red guys.
[3:01:56] <+SilverInferno3> They can be stunned, but it's safer to dodge and attack
[3:01:57] <%krispen_wa> IT'S NOT A COUNTER
[3:01:58] <+RiverKing13> stun isn't a counter
[3:02:01] <leith_aziz> Lets just say we learn differently

[3:02:02] <%krispen_wa> YOU CAN DO IT WHENEVER
[3:02:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> rock beats paper tho
[3:02:04] <BlackermanZX> red bad. blue good StinkyGlitch
[3:02:04] <mankeymania> stounter
[3:02:05] <CoffeeShopA> The tutorial is poorly explained
[3:02:07] <leith_aziz> I never had an issue with this
[3:02:08] <+zepelinnn1> you need to stun to hurt knife guys, you dont need to do it to prevent red damage, because its not a counter against the stun batton enemy
[3:02:09] <%dreadedcthulhu> is woolie's point
[3:02:10] <user_naim> No, you stun them if they have knives
[3:02:10] <+0neReeler> timing is different
[3:02:10] <Asuterisuku> @Feralspirit41 But now he's been introduced to Batons, which also have an unblockable attaqck and have to be taken out another way.
[3:02:13] <dinnydanny777> limesCorn
[3:02:13] <JayEarly> 1 Dodge= keep combo, 2 Dodge= combo broken
[3:02:13] <%krispen_wa> You can even do it to normal enemies
[3:02:13] <Viewtiful_Rose> No, you do want to stun red guys. It‚Äôs just not a counter. People are being hung up on semantics woolie isn‚Äôt incorrect
[3:02:14] <Zebroneath> it's best to treat it as a stun rather than a counter
[3:02:15] <SwerveBootyHammer> yo don't need to wait for an attack to stun
[3:02:15] <+allups> I get woolies logic with the stun being a counter
[3:02:16] <TheWizardOfWordplay> it's not a counter it's an attack whenever you want to do it
[3:02:17] <user_naim> You are misunderstanding
[3:02:19] <+Gohyakuen> you can stun them at any point
[3:02:19] <SpartanDumpster> Like a general rule, guys who's attack flashes red, you should probably stun when trying to fight them, not stun them for that attack.
[3:02:20] <+nomad390> The only way to win is not to play the game
[3:02:21] <splinter1619> Red lines just means uncounterable, you can hit the b button to stum them at any time
[3:02:24] <BlackermanZX> or you can batarang too StinkyGlitch
[3:02:24] <$emptyantics> If an enemy has a knife, you HAVE to STUN them
[3:02:25] <leith_aziz> For me, I understood it like the game said
[3:02:29] <thelivingglitch307> the stun can faster than the knife attacks but you have to be 1 step ahead
[3:02:30] <+JacknZack27> You should preemptively stun them before they attack. Not counter them with it
[3:02:30] <sunnythedrunk> People are being really bad at explaining
[3:02:31] <%SainEdge> maybe woolie should watch a short video of someone doing a good or even flawless fight to see how it can work. Seems to me that woolie is a visual learner. Or he should try a combat challange
[3:02:35] <kazadaz> "Stun" should be called "guard-break"
[3:02:37] <%krispen_wa> I can't believe I once thought Woolie was the rational one of the duo
[3:02:37] <Clundy> Somebody send Reggie a pdf of the manual LUL
[3:02:40] <leith_aziz> But again, that doesnt apply to EVERYBODY
[3:02:42] <Bigyanno> Just stun everyone. Ain't nobody gonna hurt you when they got a face full of cape
[3:02:43] <+allups> yah u dont have to wait to stun that is where ur fuking up tbh
[3:02:44] <%dreadedcthulhu> y'all woolie understands the mechanic
[3:02:46] <%rottingpastry> Red attacks are uncounterable. Knife enemies have to be stunned. Knife enemies have red attacks. These three things are not related beyond the content of these sentences.
[3:02:52] <Lancaster_H> woolie you need to focus crush the red enemies
[3:02:52] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Arkham City had a better tutorial
[3:02:52] <waffleandman> this game isnt very hard and doesnt really matter
[3:02:56] <Lancaster_H> play footsies
[3:02:56] <+Kruse_Control> You can stun any time, its not exclusive to when they have the red indicator. The red just means this attack can not be countered
[3:02:56] <brachydios777> Chat getting cranky
[3:02:58] <Doctadaking> Goon conversations are so good
[3:03:00] <T_Sasquatch> woolie figured it out
[3:03:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Are the combat challenges available before the end of the game?
[3:03:02] <user_naim> You have to stun knife guys to attack them. That‚Äôs what the tutorial told you
[3:03:03] <sunnythedrunk> D:
[3:03:07] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[3:03:08] <dinnydanny777> limesYikes
[3:03:08] <+JacknZack27> Yeah. Its more like a guard break
[3:03:09] <TheWizardOfWordplay> the word red and stun has lost all meaning to me
[3:03:12] <%mundanelotus> oof
[3:03:15] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[3:03:15] <JdotSweapA> blktasTHINK
[3:03:16] <%SainEdge> D:

[3:03:19] <Komayeda> HOO BOY
[3:03:19] <deviljhojho_> gottem
[3:03:20] <dinnydanny777> I understand why these guys are in here limesHmm
[3:03:20] <AngryAsian5> bruh
[3:03:21] <Reaganball_Z> Bruh
[3:03:21] <%doomerskeletor13> FUCKED UP
[3:03:23] <%Feralspirit41> These really arent good people
[3:03:27] <CanadianAdam> these criminals seem pretty bad
[3:03:31] <thebalticguy1> Knife-users will always block unless stunned
[3:03:34] <JdotSweapA> ok, he dies first? kl
[3:03:34] <leith_aziz> Yeah these are thugs allright..
[3:03:35] <%krispen_wa> WHY IS GOTHAM SO FUCKED
[3:03:40] <+sevorai> Dodging doesn't drop your combo, it actually just prolongs it. You do have to act faster as your combo numbers go up
[3:03:40] <%krispen_wa> NUKE THE CITY
[3:03:41] <deviljhojho_> oh yeah the goons fucking suck,they sure are funny tho
[3:03:46] <deviljhojho_> its morally gray
[3:03:46] <%krispen_wa> ITS THE ONLY WAY
[3:03:54] <dinnydanny777> Gotham is haunted *cocks nuke* Gothams haunted
[3:03:58] <CocoonMoon> I say just hit the bad guys limesCorn
[3:03:59] <Hawkbone_> LUL
[3:03:59] <Asuterisuku> Goons taking floor pills.
[3:04:02] <dinnydanny777> limesCorn
[3:04:08] <Yung_FckUp> gooncast
[3:04:09] <+nabs2099> If a goon is funny then they're morally grey. If a villain is hot they're morally grey. remember that.
[3:04:10] <peachy996> Rated T for Teen
[3:04:11] <+ja07sj> hey player we want you to know these are BAD GUYS so you can feel OKAY about BEATING THEM INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS
[3:04:12] <%rottingpastry> I remember combo breaking after 3 or 4 empty dodges, but yeah
[3:04:13] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Woolie you are half-right. The red enemies/enemies with knives cant be hit at all until they are stunned. Thats why your combo is dropping. They are blocking you, because they aren't stunned.
[3:04:14] <mudamudajo> Man, imagine a Blade game on tthis level.
[3:04:15] <+zepelinnn1> you gonna learn today
[3:04:20] <thelivingglitch307> @krispen_wa I second this motion as acting senator
[3:04:22] <+Walopoh> Imagine killing people to be a slave to a douchebag murder clown
[3:04:25] <Hawkbone_> "I took some random medicine I found on a corpse, didn't even get high, what a disappointment"
[3:04:28] <dukenux> whaaa? Arkham inmates being fd in the head?
[3:04:29] <deviljhojho_> guns in assylum arent as funny as city and knight
[3:04:32] <deviljhojho_> i mean goons
[3:04:33] <rytisone> those two batarangs would be really useful now
[3:04:33] <PanicSwytch> There are more dark commentary
[3:04:40] <leith_aziz> City is generally more comedic with conversations and I prefer it like that. But there are still many exceptions in that game
[3:04:44] <peachy996> LOL Daintily land in the middle of the circle
[3:04:51] <Asuterisuku> Enemies can and WILL pick up dropped guns.
[3:04:53] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Why don‚Äôt you meet me in the middle
[3:04:54] <dukenux> OWW D:
[3:04:54] <Asuterisuku> One just did.
[3:04:57] <%mundanelotus> It does suck you can't counter when you are already punching someone
[3:05:00] <+0neReeler> oow
[3:05:04] <+condemned_15> don't wait for them to punch
[3:05:05] <dundore77> walking without attacking also drops the combo
[3:05:07] <Doctadaking> You take a lot less damage tho.
[3:05:15] <kazataca> I
[3:05:16] <TallPixels> hey alright
[3:05:20] <Chester_goes_Berserk> OW
[3:05:23] <dinnydanny777> Did that goon say nice
[3:05:29] <kazadaz> batman yeah
[3:05:32] <leith_aziz> What a dodge
[3:05:34] <jamsbybetty> the combo system is a lot more intuitive in later games
[3:05:34] <T_Sasquatch> youd be shocked how dumb the average person is . its why cults are stil a thing
[3:05:37] <Asuterisuku> Getting shot, obviously, drops the combo.
[3:05:39] <peachy996> I see one problem you're having is the slowdown effect confusing you whether to dodge or strike
[3:05:40] <MrDoomtastic44> If you could cancel from punch to counter too early, it'd just be waaay too easy
[3:05:43] <+0neReeler> my cabbages
[3:05:46] <JayEarly> the goon reactions are still burned into my mind
[3:05:46] <TallPixels> atpGood
[3:05:52] <El_Rabbit> Direction + attack button takes you to the next enemy, you don't have to walk to them
[3:05:56] <splinter1619> Dont forget you can quick throw a batarang if there is too much distance between you and them
[3:05:57] <ajmgamesdev> Take out the gunmen first, use your batarangs and RC batarangs more
[3:05:57] <%krispen_wa> Do you really get it? do you?
[3:05:58] <MrDoomtastic44> You can still do it, just not that early in the windup
[3:05:59] <jamsbybetty> MY BREADSTICKS
[3:06:00] <Yung_FckUp> git gud
[3:06:01] <Reaganball_Z> "It's Payne!"
[3:06:02] <deviljhojho_> yeah direction plus atack covers a lot of distance
[3:06:03] <JayEarly> ‚ÄúGet him on the ground and stomp on his face!‚Äù
[3:06:04] <user_naim> Stun is a guard break for knife guys
[3:06:04] <+Gohyakuen> I don't think that's true at all
[3:06:05] <choopercabra> Its a little finicky it seems.
[3:06:09] <%CodenameChaz> Feels like the penalty for whiffing a hit/counter is too stiff
[3:06:11] <+SilverInferno3> Its the first game, combat has some growing pains
[3:06:15] <leith_aziz> First game syndrome
[3:06:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:06:18] <T_Sasquatch> @MrDoomtastic44 i swear i remember it literally just auto countering enemies as long as i pressed it
[3:06:19] <Tampaoster> The frame rate is all over the place
[3:06:20] <dinnydanny777> What sucks is that some combat animations take longer than others, so sometimes an attack lands and you can counter or sometimes it takes too long and misses
[3:06:25] <deviljhojho_> true, assylum combat is the weakest by far
[3:06:26] <leith_aziz> Things end up clunky at the start
[3:06:26] <+sevorai> Arkham City has smoother combo IMO
[3:06:28] <TheWizardOfWordplay> also when you get a good number immediately do a combo takedown. you have I frames and it immediately takes them down
[3:06:30] <%rottingpastry> @mundanelotus That's kind of the point though. You do eventually commit to an attack. It's just really lenient.
[3:06:30] <+cicatjb> dude what if they gave batman a gun dismantle move ala big boss
[3:06:34] <T_Sasquatch> i dont think its first game issues
[3:06:34] <+Undenizen> have you noticed Batman is so into his own shit he sprays the gel in the shape of his bat logo? he fruckin loves it.
[3:06:41] <%Stupid121v2> Zzazz Paul over here
[3:06:44] <+cicatjb> sorry boss
[3:06:45] <+0neReeler> kind of hard to whiff if i remember, unless upgrade he will leap incredible lengths
[3:06:47] <Wild_Samurai> This game still feels better than Spider-Man. The windup and anticipation of the enemy strikes are everything
[3:06:48] <huskarl_zap> kek
[3:06:48] <Hawkbone_> @cicatjb He already does
[3:06:48] <jamsbybetty> @cicatjb pretty sure you can in later games
[3:06:48] <T_Sasquatch> im almost in a mood to replay the series just to see LUL
[3:06:50] <Equirah> can you not input buffer the counter in this game? cause you can in the others
[3:06:57] <+dranok_x> Zsasz poses hi bodies
[3:06:58] <sunnythedrunk> You can Buffer the counter
[3:07:00] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @cicatjb he gets that in city
[3:07:03] <peachy996> Asylum Combat is the weakest but City/Origins/Knight has so much going on I dunno if Woolie could deal
[3:07:03] <%CptnCampy61> @cicatjb He gets one in the sequels
[3:07:06] <huskarl_zap> That was pretty funny
[3:07:06] <MrDoomtastic44> @T_Sasquatch The gap between when it will and won't work's pretty small but enough that some players get hit. Not that often tho
[3:07:07] <+cicatjb> kek never played them so i didnt know
[3:07:08] <leith_aziz> @dinnydanny777: This is a big issue with the franchise imo
[3:07:08] <kazadaz> nah, counters got way better in City
[3:07:10] <%rottingpastry> You shouldn't buffer the counter, but you can.
[3:07:14] <+Walopoh> @T_Sasquatch I get that but where's the Joker's initial allure? Most people join gangs for power. Joker doesn't promise any of that, he's just a murderous clown that offers nothing to his grunts.
[3:07:17] <+allups> u can dodge out of sniper show btw
[3:07:22] <+allups> shots*
[3:07:33] <Doctadaking> YEAH
[3:07:36] <+allups> nice
[3:07:36] <Asuterisuku> What a time to turn around.
[3:07:44] <Wild_Samurai> Moooody Music
[3:07:44] <peachy996> Like I'm looking at Woolie now and I'm reminded of the shield men in City or the assassins
[3:07:46] <leith_aziz> You cant plan ahead with how long your attacks will take since its random what type of attack you'll do
[3:07:46] <%krispen_wa> Joker fights against SOCIETY. thats motivation enough
[3:07:56] <CoffeeShopA> @walopoh probably fear of getting killed by him
[3:07:58] <randomguy722> @walopoh people join him because they can fuck shit up for fun with no compromise
[3:08:02] <%saladin1911> @walopoh Probably blackmail and shit tbh. We basically see a conversation play out earlier in the game where he threatens a thugs family for not complying
[3:08:03] <Equirah> @rottingpastry it's useful to get it coming out of animations
[3:08:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Joker has a bit of a cult of personality
[3:08:12] <Asuterisuku> Like guns, enemies WILL pick up dropped batons.
[3:08:13] <peachy996> See? Didn't break your combo
[3:08:15] <+PikeBot> @Equirah input buffering on the counter is actually making wools drop his combos, he keep[s buffeirng in counters after he's hitting the enemy that's swinging on him
[3:08:18] <%mundanelotus> yeah that dodge be helping keep thos combos alive
[3:08:21] <TallPixels> that hit box
[3:08:25] <peachy996> You even got a free roll out of it
[3:08:26] <%krispen_wa> Look how many people like Joker in REAL LIFE
[3:08:34] <Frodiddly> MUCH better. Very nice!
[3:08:35] <dinnydanny777> Smile pretty boy? He's wearing a mask LUL
[3:08:40] <%Stupid121v2> "Dont get hit" -Goon #541 playing SFV
[3:08:43] <%krispen_wa> Now imagine if you lived in Gotham, full of cursed evil gas
[3:08:43] <%mundanelotus> sick
[3:08:46] <kazadaz> there it is, the flow
[3:08:51] <thebalticguy1> That was a good combo
[3:08:51] <nicversus> Man the Arkham cafeteria must feed these guys protein shakes
[3:08:51] <@Solidus_113> as long as your hit the 5x combo point you can do the X+Y instant takedowns, you don't have to wait for the prompts @WoolieVersus
[3:08:52] <huskarl_zap> KERZOWMO
[3:08:52] <Yung_FckUp> he beginning to belive
[3:08:53] <Asuterisuku> Any time the combo counter is yellow you can use a+X or B+Y
[3:08:53] <Depthcharge2030> pretty good
[3:08:58] <nicversus> everyone's goddamn jacked
[3:08:59] <peachy996> You're starting to get the flow now at least
[3:09:01] <Tampaoster> Batman does not kill LUL
[3:09:03] <deafmelone> cooool
[3:09:05] <thebalticguy1> 5x combo unlocks the super moves
[3:09:08] <@Solidus_113> or yeah, B+Y
[3:09:08] <Reaganball_Z> "Never killed anyone"
[3:09:11] <Wild_Samurai> use the TAKEDOWNS and Batarangs
[3:09:15] <+condemned_15> oof that lighting
[3:09:16] <jamsbybetty> making me really wanna play City again
[3:09:20] <Doctadaking> Isn‚Äôt he wearing a helmet?
[3:09:20] <%SainEdge> that was so much better than all the fights befoew, good job woolie
[3:09:20] <peachy996> But yeah Evade is necessary in this combat style
[3:09:22] <turbofolk> Era of we cant animate their mouths
[3:09:24] <+Walopoh> I just struck a lot of dude's heads LUL
[3:09:29] <%krispen_wa> Is that Liquid Snake?
[3:09:30] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus Your attack range also increases as your combo goes higher btw
[3:09:31] <leith_aziz> I mean they probably Join Joker because they think hes top dog among criminals, like they'll most likely suceed with him
[3:09:35] <dinnydanny777> He looks dead
[3:09:36] <kazadaz> arkham souls
[3:09:36] <+rottingpastry> lol let him get the flow of stun counter attack dodge before throwing in gadgets
[3:09:38] <+Gohyakuen> shake him
[3:09:40] <TheWizardOfWordplay> b+y always when you get a gold number
[3:09:41] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Why would anyone take this jorb! It‚Äôs a violent madhouse
[3:09:41] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The game isn't giving you the tooltips anymore, but yeah, once the combo counter glows yellow, hit B+Y for an instant takedown in whatever direction you are pointing the stick
[3:09:51] <MrDoomtastic44> @turbofolk A ton of characters have their mouths animated tho
[3:09:57] <BlackermanZX> corpse (breathing)
[3:09:59] <%bearwagon> oh no
[3:10:00] <dukenux> thats a cool detail actually

[3:10:42] <Bigyanno> Ah I remember when riddler puzzles were quick little fun things and not hour long slogs
[3:10:43] <+Mr_Pylon> Witness ripped off Batman confirmed
[3:10:51] <@Solidus_113> Not quite Superliminal Kappa

[3:11:04] <unthought> Riddler is that guy who keeps telling that joke you never laugh at.
[3:11:10] <dukenux> Witness is all the cool puzzles with no Riddler
[3:11:18] <%rottingpastry> it's semen
[3:11:20] <Hawkbone_> I mean, Riddler stuff more or less stays the same throughout the games.
[3:11:20] <Tampaoster> Arkham city send their regards when speaking about hour long slogs for the riddlers riddles

[3:11:30] <tukds> I love the UI and design decisions in this game, you can tell they actually gave a shit. most modern big budget games are bland as fuck in that department
[3:11:30] <huskarl_zap> Riddler is Jim Carrie
[3:11:30] <jamsbybetty> One detrimental thing about Asylum is how much it relies on Detective Vision, you need it so much you barely get to see the actual game graphics

[3:12:40] <%Double_Tap_That> @brunoberserk Why would you highlight this then act as if you're not talking directly at him?

[3:12:47] <thelivingglitch307> @Wild_Samurai that's the slogan
[3:12:47] <Hawkbone_> This game pushes Zsasz more than I remembered

[3:13:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THE MARK
[3:13:15] <+ClericOfSparda> Why would you place a female doctor to a serial killer who targets women?

[3:13:19] <%Stupid121v2> such a lame batman villain
[3:13:20] <Depthcharge2030> why did they push zsasz?
[3:13:22] <peachy996> He's a nihilist and therefore a coward
[3:13:23] <Darren716> It looks like he has way more than 20 marks
[3:13:25] <%saladin1911> ON HIS PENIS

[3:13:38] <Prevot> man he has SO MANY marks
[3:13:40] <brunoberserk> sometimes i forget zsasz exists ...
[3:13:40] <dukenux> Zsasz is a pretty down to earth villain compared to all the otger ones
[3:13:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> his dick
[3:13:43] <mudamudajo> Its on my Peepee
[3:13:44] <Halospaz117> The taint
[3:13:46] <alroy900> god he' s so lame
[3:13:46] <Reaganball_Z> You think Zsasz ever gave himself two marks when nobody was looking?
[3:13:48] <TheWizardOfWordplay> save it
[3:13:49] <dinnydanny777> You would think Zsasz would eventually die
[3:13:49] <%Nomad_Scholar> How many tally marks are already on his dick?
[3:13:53] <dukenux> hes just a mysoginistic serial kiler
[3:13:53] <+Walopoh> I love that he's such an edgelord yet Batman clearly terrifies him LUL Fuck Zsasz
[3:13:56] <peachy996> Oh there are WAY dumber villains than Zsasz come on

[3:14:04] <AvroEltz> the dick is reserved for batman
[3:14:08] <%X2Eliah> Zsasz is not a "fun" villain, he's just a creepy evil POS
[3:14:09] <+0neReeler> bizzarro bruce wayne
[3:14:10] <Komayeda> Zsasz is *definitely* a modern batman villain, just an edgy guy without any 90s super guns
[3:14:10] <+allups> dont read my search histor aloud woolie
[3:14:12] <coreybom> @brunoberserk In fairness they don‚Äôt use hime much.
[3:14:12] <+cicatjb> the only time he's ever been interesting was in the talltale game
[3:14:16] <puluxor> @splinter1619 I kind of dislike how Asylum forces you to do encounters one way or the other, stealth or combat.
[3:14:18] <deviljhojho_> i like how zsasz is portrayed as a huge wimp tryhard because thats what most serial killers are IRL
[3:14:19] <dukenux> @huskarl_zap is that actual lore
[3:14:25] <%CptnCampy61> Now we‚Äôre talking
[3:14:30] <%SainEdge> Zssasz is just like a real life serial killer, a big big coward
[3:14:31] <huskarl_zap> @dukenux Lol probably not
[3:14:34] <+SilverInferno3> What is SFX
[3:14:37] <%Stupid121v2> Zsasz is a Criminal Minds villain, not batman imo
[3:14:39] <dukenux> too bad
[3:14:41] <heart_ablaze> zsaz in batman is like the shocker in spiderman
[3:14:44] <splinter1619> rip whiff batarang
[3:14:47] <$emptyantics> Remember the timr Zssasz became Batman and killed 40 women?
[3:14:53] <%Nomad_Scholar> Whiff's
[3:14:54] <Tampaoster> Whats happening with twitch? we cant say the word h o anymore?
[3:14:54] <Reaganball_Z> Zsasz in the new Batwoman was hilarious. He straight up fired an RPG out of his apartment's window like it was nothing.
[3:14:59] <%Nomad_Scholar> Whiff's everywhere
[3:15:00] <waffleandman> going from arkham city to this game is not easy
[3:15:02] <Asuterisuku> Because it knocks down now it's great crowd control.
[3:15:04] <kazadaz> an easy one
[3:15:04] <Komayeda> ...wait, i thought that was azrael?
[3:15:05] <+Walopoh> Somehow Zsasz is the most tryhard wimp in Batman and that's saying something.
[3:15:06] <+zepelinnn1> fuck my shit up cut
[3:15:09] <%Double_Tap_That> It's a yeeyee-ass haircut
[3:15:12] <user_naim> That‚Äôs for guns
[3:15:15] <SheefEatsBeef> it's much better with the double rangs
[3:15:17] <+0neReeler> red one
[3:15:18] <%phd_in_thuggery> Remember that time Zsasz fucked my wife?
[3:15:24] <Komayeda> I do
[3:15:27] <%CptnCampy61> Tap it in a combo
[3:15:27] <deviljhojho_> i do
[3:15:28] <%Dante_Namikaze1> it's the haircut that the mutant gang has in The Dark Knight returns book
[3:15:29] <Wild_Samurai> Batman May Cry
[3:15:30] <Komayeda> It was very graphic
[3:15:31] <dukenux> i was there
[3:15:33] <+SilverInferno3> I dunno, I remember Anarky being a huge loser
[3:15:34] <+ApollyonAOD> @WoolieVersus When the combo number is yellow you can do instant takedowns which help a ton, especially against tough enemies like the blade boys
[3:15:34] <peachy996> @waffleandman I've done it before. It's really weird to play. Trying to do things you can't yet
[3:15:38] <BigBlackBankai> yee yee
[3:15:39] <NumbF4ke> I really liked zsasz in gotham, just a regural ass hitman
[3:15:56] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> don't whiff it also you cant use two in a row. you have to do a different follow up action.
[3:15:58] <jamsbybetty> LET'S HIT THOSE SHOWERS
[3:16:02] <+condemned_15> a lotta towel snappin

[3:34:32] <HUGOMASTRPICE> this gameplay is the best

[3:34:37] <%doomerskeletor13> @mrdoomtastic44 Arleen had to retire because of cancer iirc
[3:34:37] <Carlioo> did you ever actually get to fight harley?
[3:34:38] <Wild_Samurai> USE THE TAKEDOWN button at 5 hits
[3:34:40] <+allups> good rolls
[3:34:43] <kazataca> Zipline the guns!!
[3:34:44] <+condemned_15> quit waiting for a prompt and just punch
[3:34:50] <deviljhojho_> Not bad
[3:34:51] <+CptBritches> Good combo
[3:34:51] <dinnydanny777> Just don't let him hit you 4Head
[3:34:57] <Asuterisuku> The batclaw can also be used in combos, but it's a bit trickier in this game.
[3:35:01] <+allups> i like how woolie went from not rolling at all to rolling all the time
[3:35:04] <+Walopoh> ayy woolie's getting it
[3:35:06] <nicversus> ever notice how the guns are loaded with Batman-seeking bullets? Like he could be standing amidst a bunch of thugs, but the bullets only ever hit Batman
[3:35:08] <+mechslayer71> Rookie still mashing huh
[3:35:16] <Prevot> does he have quick batclaw or is that an unlock?
[3:35:22] <+mechslayer71> Woolie*, but the other one works too
[3:35:23] <peachy996> Harley just swingin around

[3:35:25] <+allups> look at her up there
[3:35:25] <MrDoomtastic44> @doomerskeletor13 That's understandable, I just appreciate the work is all
[3:35:30] <NoireRequiem> Batarang time
[3:35:33] <PMda2nd> can the new goons see the guns?
[3:35:38] <%X2Eliah> Friendship ended with counter, dodge is new best friend
[3:35:40] <T_Sasquatch> i wish we could see button inputs
[3:35:40] <Zalthia> Theres a great short where the Joker and the Prankster kidnap famous actor Mark Hamill- who escapes by imitating the villain's respective voices until they are taken down by Swamp Thing.
[3:35:50] <Wild_Samurai> i dont think Batclaw gonna get much use when he doesnt use the Takedown button haflway through the game
[3:35:50] <%spuddnyk> it's all fun and games until someone starts shooting
[3:35:53] <PMda2nd> bullets cancel style

[3:36:55] <Hawkbone_> Button mashing just serves to make the combat harder than it needs to be

[3:40:06] <BlackermanZX> this game loves blue

[3:40:22] <deviljhojho_> yeah zsasz is scary to the average unarmed gothamite but he is a bottom feeder overall
[3:40:22] <NoireRequiem> Calendar man though
[3:40:24] <%rottingpastry> detective vision does not affect meta game elements as far as I know...?
[3:40:28] <deviljhojho_> thats why he always gets taken out in one hit
[3:40:30] <user_naim> There is only ONE counter type think. The red is dodge
[3:40:33] <%MooseIsGoose> I think two faces cell is near
[3:40:40] <splinter1619> red just means uncounterable
[3:40:41] <dinnydanny777> If Ivy got pregnant, would she give birth to a tree child
[3:40:41] <randomguy722> @emptyfist why Joker wasn't? you can make the same question to basically any villain at this point. it's pretty much agreed that Gotham is so corrupt and crazy that batman is the only thing keeping the slightest sense of order
[3:40:42] <BlackermanZX> i played this game with detective mode active like 70% of the time
[3:40:44] <+SolidusRex> Nah, the lamest Batman villain is the Penny Pincher
[3:40:46] <CubeyXOF> some people play practically the entire game in detective vision
[3:40:54] <NoireRequiem> Dabadeedabada
[3:40:55] <deviljhojho_> i thought the lamest villian was the carpenter
[3:41:01] <user_naim> @solidusrex Condiment King?
[3:41:03] <Asuterisuku> It is NOT a combat tool.
[3:41:03] <Komayeda> But what about Killer Moth
[3:41:04] <%Javaa01> Yeah you can't do this in combat
[3:41:07] <MrDoomtastic44> @rottingpastry Not as much in this one. In City, it obscures slightly more but not enough to not be extremely useful
[3:41:07] <%Double_Tap_That> Big Wheel?
[3:41:15] <+Gohyakuen> at least the carpenter's got a trade
[3:41:15] <UncleOliver> fine, the lamest batman villain that they're trying to push
[3:41:15] <+condemned_15> later
[3:41:16] <peachy996> That's why it's on Diagonal
[3:41:16] <WinstonFromUndertale> @cubeyxof were watching that currently lol
[3:41:16] <Asuterisuku> Still can't do this yet.
[3:41:17] <Prevot> the lamest batman villain is the Arkham Knight LUL

[3:41:23] <$emptyantics> In AK isn‚Äôt there a butcher OC villian?
[3:41:24] <+SolidusRex> @user_naim Condiment King is GOAT
[3:41:26] <mudamudajo> Naw, Condiment King
[3:41:28] <huskarl_zap> Plastic man
[3:41:28] <Doctadaking> You can check the upgrades and find out
[3:41:29] <MrDoomtastic44> @Komayeda Killer Moth's fine, he's an anti-Batman, just not used often
[3:41:31] <slix3431> Worst Batman villain was rock and roll

[3:41:34] <Zalthia> @dinnydanny777 yeah but hes pretty cool.
[3:41:41] <dukenux> Polka-Dot Man?
[3:41:45] <peachy996> @emptyantics That would be Pyg and he's from the recent comics
[3:41:46] <user_naim> @solidusrex yeah, you‚Äôre right

[3:42:08] <deviljhojho_> babyface at least had a cool episode
[3:42:08] <+SilverInferno3> Worst Batman villain is "Superman but evil"
[3:42:09] <Manmush> mad hatter
[3:42:11] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Do you like games to tell you when you're missing something or do you like to wonder if you're missing something and come back later?
[3:42:13] <Hawkbone_> Calendar Man was cool in Arkham City
[3:42:14] <user_naim> oh Crazy Quilt?
[3:42:17] <dinnydanny777> @zalthia Yeah he is, I remember him from the Lego batman game, but there he had wings LUL
[3:42:17] <randomguy722> all batman villains are ridiculous until someone make a dark and grin story with them, then they become the best villains ever
[3:42:17] <MrDoomtastic44> Calendar Man was great in Long Halloween/Dark Victory

[3:43:44] <Wild_Samurai> Batman looks naked without the underwear. Change my mind!
[3:43:46] <+samuraiknack> Mad Hatter is a pedophile
[3:44:02] <Doctadaking> Just go in the west area
[3:44:02] <%LoVezineTheAir> ah yes, the famed zapping system

[3:44:12] <Zalthia> Man, Azrael was so cool in City
[3:44:13] <$priceyyeti40> He's a BIG pedo.
[3:44:16] <NeoseekerStitch> Batman sure is detectiving a lot.
[3:44:18] <Wofoeh> Yeah this one is busted, you did it on the upper floor
[3:44:25] <BlackermanZX> try weast StinkyGlitch
[3:44:32] <mortificent> Mad Hatter is super creepy with the Alice obsession
[3:44:39] <$ParatrooperDylan> I do like how this game has you do detective work in addition to beating up bad guys.
[3:44:41] <Wofoeh> @BlackermanZX Or Nouth
[3:44:55] <peachy996> YOU DID IT BUDDY
[3:45:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Prometheus
[3:45:07] <randomguy722> something I hate about the Joker nowadays is how people try to paint him as a insane psycho at same time he acts like a very capable strategic master mind gangster that takes the entirety of Gotham for himself

[3:58:07] <+FuqBoiSlim> Give me what I want...GIVE ME WHAT I WANT
[3:58:08] <enerkaizer> Was Zsasz ever used for any good Batman story? Everytime he shows up it feels like he's only there to be a jobber for Batman
[3:58:10] <NoireRequiem> Gimme it

[3:58:52] <unthought> His first story was pretty good, he was created to start a new line of comics, Shadow of the Bat iirc
[3:58:59] <ashenjuan25> Beat those mentally ill bitches into a pulp
[3:59:00] <VidulaSaix> @akuda_bar Johnny the Tackling Alzheimers Patient
[3:59:02] <+condemned_15> go back into those breakable wall
[3:59:03] <Zalthia> My favorite stories with the Riddler are when he tries to go straight
[3:59:07] <dukenux> you can see him in Arkham or Blackgate
[3:59:08] <@akuda_bar> @VidulaSaix ye ye ye ye

[3:59:43] <+FuqBoiSlim> whoa aah mental illness üò® üòü
[3:59:46] <picanoturna> two face riddle right there
[3:59:51] <peachy996> Ironically the next batman game ditches the Arkham naming convention altogether
[3:59:55] <iLike_femboys> did he got the calender man riddle?
[3:59:59] <+Crippl3> reminder that tnbe next game in the Arkham series is NOT the Gotham Knights game, but it's actually the Suicide Squad third-person-shooter
[4:00:00] <dinnydanny777> @saladin1911 I don't think so
[4:00:01] <+Shackle_Rustyford> Arkham continent

[4:00:13] <jorniev> TAKE OFF THE SKELETON DIMENSION
[4:00:14] <enerkaizer> Still sad that they backpeddeld from making Arkham world with the Batman beyond setting, considering the originall end for Arkham city set that up very well until the DLc retconned it
[4:00:15] <@Solidus_113> it was here
[4:00:15] <picanoturna> a wall in the big cell
[4:00:17] <Darren716> SCAN THAT ROOM
[4:00:17] <+ChancellorOfLights> there we go
[4:00:17] <dukenux> @saladin1911 probably not unless you also pump them chock full of drugs
[4:00:18] <Asuterisuku> Suicide Squad is the next Rocksteady game, yeah.
[4:00:19] <NeoseekerStitch> it is that room
[4:00:20] <ashenjuan25> Man Arkham is nice and all but it‚Äôs too edgy for my liking and hearing the cast of this games just makes me wish we got an animated series game like Batman Vengeance with Arkham gameplay
[4:00:21] <joeinky> you just looked right at it
[4:00:21] <Hawkbone_> There are no more Arkham games. The Arham series is over.

[4:01:58] <thelivingglitch307> @Solidus_113 ...are obvious
[4:02:00] <ashenjuan25> Man people shit on origins but I think it did detective work and recreating crime scenes better than any mainline Arkham game handles detective work and vision
[4:02:03] <+mister___doctor> @Doctadaking He has less shit to talk the more you actually solve his shit, which is a nice touch

[4:02:04] <enerkaizer> For those who don't know: Dc actually made comics based specifically on the Adam West Batman series. In one of them he actually has a crossover with the 70ies Live action Wonder-Woman, featuring a Burt Ward as Nightwing
[4:02:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hoit
[4:02:09] <BlackermanZX> who built this ass room
[4:02:09] <Wild_Samurai> bets on if Woolie will use a single Takedown??
[4:02:09] <sunnythedrunk> She sounded like Meowth there LUL
[4:02:10] <nicversus> dats gotta hoy-- dammit everybody beat me to it
[4:02:11] <Asuterisuku> Oh god this fight.

[4:02:21] <Tampaoster> Mr freeze is on the right there
[4:02:21] <Carlioo> yeah this challenge sucked
[4:02:23] <picanoturna> why does this exist

[4:02:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:02:28] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah this challenge room is a bitch
[4:02:31] <peachy996> Yeah the challenge version is a pain
[4:02:31] <MrDoomtastic44> Origins had it's better parts but mostly just wasn't quite as good as AA and AC
[4:02:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Nice
[4:02:42] <+condemned_15> @enerkaizer We're getting a Superman 79 and a Batman 89 comic this year
[4:02:43] <falcon_monocled> do more instant takedowns.
[4:02:43] <picanoturna> hes doing it
[4:02:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Imagine having the balls to taunt Batman. "You want some of this?"
[4:02:45] <+0neReeler> @meganicmp3 pacifist room
[4:02:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes leaaaarning
[4:02:48] <@Commando_Joe> I would do a prediction on how many deaths but I don't want Reggie to see what you guys vote LUL
[4:02:51] <Reaganball_Z> What is the therapeutic application of this room?
[4:02:51] <+Crippl3> so did wollie just forget that he has an instant kill takedown
[4:02:52] <marumiyan1> smooth
[4:02:53] <+CptBritches> He's found the rhythm
[4:02:56] <Hawkbone_> Thats the best he's done so far
[4:02:56] <Asuterisuku> Oh hey, Viktor's cell.
[4:02:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> harley no
[4:02:57] <guts32> good job
[4:03:00] <mudamudajo> Punched his ass
[4:03:03] <%rottingpastry> forgot takedowns exist tho
[4:03:03] <+taggerung403> Is Arkham an actual asylum or a superjail
[4:03:04] <+mister___doctor> Please no fried bat wings in 2021
[4:03:04] <dundore77> every 5 combo you can hit x and b for a takedown
[4:03:05] <jorniev> DR FREEZE is right there thats why this floor exists, cause super villain jail
[4:03:05] <dinnydanny777> Those guys are fine on the electric floor btw, don't worry about it limesOk
[4:03:06] <Halospaz117> Anyone else ever just chuck dudes into the void in this fight?
[4:03:06] <dukenux> monkaS too soon Harley
[4:03:10] <+DomunDomunDomun> He's beginning to believe.
[4:03:11] <dinnydanny777> Definitely not dead limesOk
[4:03:12] <picanoturna> @0neReeler paciFIST
[4:03:15] <+Grayhammatter> smooth
[4:03:15] <ashenjuan25> I find city‚Äôs and asylum‚Äôs lower than origins lows though but their highs are better than origins that‚Äôs for sure
[4:03:15] <+Shackle_Rustyford> man there sure are alot of hired goons in gotham
[4:03:18] <iLike_femboys> the guys with the stun button were a pain in the ass
[4:03:19] <Wild_Samurai> some mod please remind him that Takedown exists after 5 hits
[4:03:21] <marumiyan1> combat's looking more like a fancy rhythm game now
[4:03:22] <+Shackle_Rustyford> you'd think they'd unionize by now
[4:03:24] <user_naim> Wow, he IS getting it
[4:03:24] <BigBlackBankai> This was the hardest part of the game my first time around.
[4:03:25] <KgKid51> woolie smooving rn
[4:03:28] <deviljhojho_> YEAH
[4:03:33] <enerkaizer> @enerkaizer I know, but honestly I don't care as much about those film continuitys. Adam West is always going to be my Batman as well. Nobody, atleast to me, has ever topped him as the dark knight
[4:03:35] <coreybom> @taggerung403 It‚Äôs an asylum. The superjail is Blackgate.
[4:03:37] <picanoturna> my man doing it
[4:03:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's seeing the code
[4:03:43] <+0neReeler> first real skill check

[4:06:11] <SheefEatsBeef> sonic is pretty fun
[4:06:17] <BlackermanZX> twin for combos, remote for fun
[4:06:20] <peachy996> It's going to help in tougher Predator rooms
[4:06:20] <+Crippl3> Sonic is just a disxtraction, it has nothing to do with the collars
[4:06:21] <picanoturna> its good
[4:06:24] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Sonic is an enemy lure for stealth

[4:06:33] <MrDoomtastic44> @AWKWARDL0SER Harley's been popular since the 90s. You're referring more to a marketing push, for better or worse

[4:07:56] <rafflespaddock> best bossfight in the next game
[4:07:56] <NoireRequiem> Cheers Patoine
[4:07:56] <enerkaizer> hot take: Arni was not a bad Mr.Freeze. He would've rocked the movie if the script wasn't terribkle
[4:07:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's pat what'd you expect
[4:07:57] <TheWizardOfWordplay> thanks pat
[4:07:59] <+nabs2099> Pat can't help spoiling everything for fucks sake
[4:07:59] <Treyu000> what killed the dinosaurs? the ICE age
[4:08:00] <stardustcrusad3r> pat was just trying to share his enthusiasm
[4:08:02] <+GenesisKnight> Fries pronounced like Freeze

[4:08:09] <DSD24> What killed the Ice Age?
[4:08:09] <peachy996> Pat would have spoiled the whole last half of the game if you let him talk further
[4:08:13] <DSD24> DINOSAURS
[4:08:14] <BigBlackBankai> ONE PAT
[4:08:15] <samuelfisk> It‚Äôs not that big of a spoiler. Just because it was plastered over Arkham City marketing.
[4:08:16] <+FuqBoiSlim> Thanks, Patty Wagon.
[4:08:17] <%Nomad_Scholar> Think of it Batman
[4:08:17] <+mechslayer71> Fuck everyone in the pod chat who said that wasn‚Äôt spoilers, he clearly isn‚Äôt happy about it
[4:08:18] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Mr. Freeze has to be my favorite Batman villain

[4:08:39] <dinnydanny777> Mr Freeze isn't even really a villain limesFeels
[4:08:39] <peachy996> The freeze fight in Origins isn't bad either
[4:08:41] <MrDoomtastic44> @samuelfisk 11 years ago. It's not being marketed now
[4:08:42] <+GenesisKnight> They're the same character
[4:08:44] <DSD24> Pun intended
[4:08:45] <VidulaSaix> HES ALSO ARNOLD THAT ONE TIME
[4:08:45] <Tampaoster> He is the only villain that i have some empathy for him
[4:08:46] <splinter1619> Boom roasted

[4:08:49] <@akuda_bar> EVERYTHING.. FREEESUS
[4:08:51] <peachy996> Yeah but Captain Cold will never be Mr. Freeze
[4:08:52] <%Nomad_Scholar> To never again walk on a summer's day, with a hot wind in your face, and a warm hand to hold, oh yes, I'd kill for that
[4:08:52] <rytisone> Ice to meet you

[4:09:05] <KgKid51> I hate it
[4:09:07] <%Jiggisnipe> @samuelfisk Woolie typically avoids marketing also Pat told him how the fight works not just the existance
[4:09:10] <peachy996> You're not taking me to the Cooler
[4:09:10] <user_naim> And that spoils both an (obvious) story twist and a general boss concept.
[4:09:10] <Darren716> Cool party
[4:09:11] <enerkaizer> again, I liked arni as Freeze
[4:09:11] <NoireRequiem> Oh boy
[4:09:11] <ashenjuan25> Fuck off the animated series is the only freeze
[4:09:12] <%TheBensonator_> FRESHLY SHAVED
[4:09:13] <keankong85> yet Mr freeze is Prem skin for Capt cold in injustice 2
[4:09:14] <NeoseekerStitch> 6 feet?

[4:09:28] <picanoturna> i want him to hug me
[4:09:28] <BlackermanZX> captain cold is lame af
[4:09:30] <usurper_sos> HE'S BALD ????
[4:09:32] <DSD24> I don't know much about Nora
[4:09:33] <peachy996> Can you be Cold, Batman?
[4:09:38] <KgKid51> CAPTAIN WHO?
[4:09:38] <ashenjuan25> How the fuck are not gonna rep the animated series woolie?
[4:09:39] <+SolidusRex> Not in this game
[4:09:39] <Nightwingie> emongFeels nora
[4:09:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Arnold was the BOLDEST choice
[4:09:43] <Darren716> No VA for this game
[4:09:44] <%jepupu> sbfpSetIn woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT woolieACCIDENT
[4:09:47] <peachy996> He...Does he get tapes in City
[4:09:48] <Torgue_1> It would be cool, Woolie? Kappa
[4:09:50] <jorniev> CAPITAN COLD is a cold as motherfucker pun intended
[4:09:50] <DSD24> Bat Credit Card!
[4:09:52] <morningmoondude> Um, freezed to meet you?
[4:09:52] <NoireRequiem> @neoseekerstitch i guess it accounts for out of suit height
[4:09:52] <SixthShinx> Jim Carry as Riddler was also nuts
[4:09:53] <+FuqBoiSlim> A BAT CREDIT CARD?!?!?!
[4:09:53] <Tampaoster> BAT CARD dude
[4:09:54] <mortificent> It's fun Camp
[4:09:56] <MrDoomtastic44> Captain Cold's great. Batman and Robin
[4:09:56] <+condemned_15> Arnold was the most expensive thing in that movie. No joke
[4:09:58] <Gelphaze> Tonight's forecast A FREEEZE is coming.
[4:09:58] <%rottingpastry> To be fair, Mr. Freeze as a sad widow fuck was pretty new at the time.
[4:09:59] <Doctadaking> Can‚Äôt say he wasn‚Äôt memorable tho
[4:10:00] <%Irridium> release the nipple cut
[4:10:00] <Asuterisuku> Viktor doesn't get the respect this game.
[4:10:01] <iLike_femboys> Jim Carrey as riddler tho
[4:10:02] <dundore77> i honestly like batman and robin and Mr Freeze is a big part of it
[4:10:05] <KrimsonTVN> Bat Yams also were wild
[4:10:05] <+0neReeler> it's bad it's good
[4:10:08] <ashenjuan25> Who gives a fuck about Arnold I wanna talk about TAS
[4:10:08] <Tampaoster> YEAH @FuqBoiSlim ye yeyeyeyeyye
[4:10:09] <Reaganball_Z> I think they got his BTAS voice actor for Arkham City
[4:10:10] <enerkaizer> I wish he would play Freeze again in a serious take on the character
[4:10:11] <Komayeda> We need to get a Serious Mr. Freeze voiced by Arnold
[4:10:12] <picanoturna> never leave the batcave without it
[4:10:16] <Wofoeh> What killed the dinossaurs.... THE ICE AGE
[4:10:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Batman and Robin is culturally stronger than Snyder Cut
[4:10:17] <MrDoomtastic44> *Batman and Robin's a bad movie that people pretend to like for internet points
[4:10:19] <@Menitta> god, he could've been so good as Batman
[4:10:20] <+badjab326> The artist formerly known as Prints
[4:10:21] <+Gohyakuen> tommy lee jones as 2 face is the actual worst though
[4:10:24] <coreybom> @blackermanzx Maybe Gameplay wise, but as a character he‚Äôs pretty awesome. The ultimate pragmatic and nice criminal.
[4:10:29] <unthought> In the movie he's a decathlete
[4:10:29] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus are you going to get all the Amadeus Arkham messages?
[4:10:31] <morningmoondude> casting arnie was the... FREEZE'S KNEES
[4:10:32] <BigBlackBankai> wacky 90s
[4:10:32] <peachy996> B&R is good to see Arnold and Uma engage in a pun battle
[4:10:33] <NoireRequiem> Jim Carey as riddler too
[4:10:35] <Darren716> I think you only have to scan at the gardens
[4:10:37] <stukamod> Jim Carrey did his best Joker as the riddler impression
[4:10:37] <dundore77> Didn't the wife subplot come from that movie too or something from that movie become the standard for Freeze?
[4:10:38] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Clooney say the best part of that movie was getting to kiss Elle Macpherson
[4:10:39] <%rottingpastry> No one likes Batman and Robin
[4:10:42] <Tampaoster> two face? you meant a watered down joker clone?
[4:10:44] <%Grimlockfly> All that, and Arnie would‚Äôve crushed as comic book Bane.
[4:10:46] <NoireRequiem> And tommy lee jones as twoface
[4:10:46] <%saladin1911> Batman Forever is better tho
[4:10:47] <picanoturna> george clooney had potential
[4:10:54] <GarbageNirvana> No one in that movie got done dirtier than Bane
[4:10:55] <DSD24> Joker is Science Man
[4:10:56] <ashenjuan25> Batman forever is shit
[4:10:57] <peachy996> Nobody likes Batman & Robin unironically
[4:10:57] <DedlokPM> @dundore77 Wife subplot came from the animated series
[4:10:59] <samuelfisk> Disagree MrDoomtastic, that movie is hilarious with a beer.
[4:10:59] <$emptyantics> Someone quote the ending of the BTAS episode with Fries
[4:11:00] <@Solidus_113> DEX vs STR
[4:11:01] <au_d3n> Kinda liked the casting ngl. Very over the top and cartoony
[4:11:01] <+FuqBoiSlim> @dundore77 that backstory came from the animated series ifrc
[4:11:04] <Reaganball_Z> I liked Jim Carry's Riddler and his light-up clothes.
[4:11:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> go up
[4:11:08] <mortificent> Batman and Robin is better than Forever cause everyone knows that they're doing 60s camp and its fun
[4:11:09] <peachy996> Ironically its great fun
[4:11:10] <coreybom> @dundore77 No that came from the animated series.
[4:11:11] <mudamudajo> He's Mister white Christmas, he's mister snow
[4:11:13] <ashenjuan25> At least Batman and Robin didn‚Äôt have Jim Carey
[4:11:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> go up and take a picture of the gun
[4:11:14] <NoireRequiem> True
[4:11:19] <Wofoeh> 2 people 1 voice 1 gun
[4:11:19] <VidulaSaix> Chat, both of those movies are shit but they're still fucking awesome
[4:11:20] <%rottingpastry> @NoireRequiem You mean Tommy Lee Jones as melted face Joker and Jim Carrey as question Joker?
[4:11:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hell be good i bet
[4:11:22] <Wofoeh> Thats harvey
[4:11:25] <+condemned_15> alot of brooding
[4:11:26] <CrematedCube> Tried using that wood grain ring, got pancaked
[4:11:26] <jorniev> HE ALREADY SEEMS COOL
[4:11:29] <+GenesisKnight> I'm vengeance
[4:11:29] <TrickytheClown> Hey just tuned in is this their first time playing or?
[4:11:31] <@Menitta> I bet he'll be pretty good
[4:11:31] <Wild_Samurai> #RESTOREthe SNYDER VERSE
[4:11:33] <au_d3n> Yeah!
[4:11:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> His batmobile is pretty cool loking
[4:11:35] <%Irridium> I fucking love Robert Pattinson
[4:11:35] <KgKid51> batman forever was BAAAD
[4:11:36] <iLike_femboys> Robert Pattinson is a great actor, he will do great
[4:11:37] <Tampaoster> HE is vengeance!
[4:11:37] <picanoturna> green mile the eminem movie
[4:11:39] <%saladin1911> @peachy996 People like weird shit. It can be a funny watch
[4:11:42] <dukenux> itll be a broody man, but still could be good
[4:11:43] <tukds> People were caution with the Joker
[4:11:44] <ashenjuan25> Fuck Jim Carey I‚Äôm with Tomy Lee Jones and thinking he‚Äôs a talentless hack
[4:11:47] <dundore77> Robert Patterson does have good acting roles just not twilight
[4:11:48] <@Solidus_113> Robert Pattinson is a great actor, it was just Twilight that was shit
[4:11:49] <peachy996> It looks like it might be neat
[4:11:50] <jorniev> who plays riddler in the new movie?
[4:11:50] <CocoonMoon> @TrickytheClown Yes
[4:11:51] <enerkaizer> I honestly want to see how on earth they'd tackle the Pinguin nowadays LUL
[4:11:51] <Tampaoster> 8 mile LOL
[4:11:52] <VidulaSaix> I'm long past the point of giving a fuck about DC reboots anymore
[4:11:52] <$emptyantics> I love him ROBERT PATTINSON
[4:11:54] <%NorthGrizzly> Kill the synder verse
[4:11:54] <MrDoomtastic44> @mortificent No one liked that they were doing it. Schumacher wanted to make better movies and so did the cast.
[4:11:56] <dukenux> Id like Batman Beyond more
[4:12:00] <KaiserMario> People also were skeptical of Michael Keaton
[4:12:01] <%CptnCampy61> He should have been Terry
[4:12:04] <BlackermanZX> pattinson is pretty good
[4:12:06] <+CptBritches> Pattinson is one of the best actors working right now. Just look at Good Time or The Lighthouse
[4:12:07] <dekkitout> @Wild_Samurai Or- read Tom Taylor's Injustice series tajWHY
[4:12:11] <Wofoeh> I mean, honestly? Robert did a fucking FANTASTIC JOB in the lighthouse
[4:12:13] <AShinyVagikarp> The Lighthouse was amazing!
[4:12:14] <coreybom> Plus the director is honestly a great choice. Due did the recent change planet of the apes films.
[4:12:14] <ashenjuan25> Micheal Keaton as Bruce in a Batman beyond movie tho
[4:12:15] <jorniev> jim carrey should play the joker
[4:12:16] <iLike_femboys> @Solidus_113 lighthouse, good tim and devil all the time show that he is an amazing actor
[4:12:16] <%rottingpastry> Or a plan. A plan works pretty good
[4:12:18] <+0neReeler> affleck was surprisingly fine
[4:12:20] <GarbageNirvana> Pattinson is better than the sparkly vampire meme everyone thinks he is
[4:12:22] <@akuda_bar> jimmy the tackling alzheimer's patient!
[4:12:23] <$emptyantics> @mrdoomtastic44 Schumacer is actually a decent director
[4:12:25] <Darren716> I can't believe we never got a full Clooney batman film
[4:12:28] <@akuda_bar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ranu8BOvQmQ
[4:12:31] <Wofoeh> Fuck that crazy guy LUL
[4:12:31] <dinnydanny777> I saw the video of Pattinson falling off the bike on set
[4:12:31] <BlackermanZX> also i'll take pattinson batman over whatever the fuck the synder batman was
[4:12:32] <+cicatjb> what is there to act with batman he's always the same its the overall story that always falls flat
[4:12:33] <Hzealot> Pattinson was good in TENET
[4:12:34] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieYE
[4:12:34] <jorniev> instead of that riddler
[4:12:35] <ashenjuan25> Keaton as old Bruce
[4:12:35] <+monsieurfantastic> tom Holland is average
[4:12:36] <iLike_femboys> im already sick of spiderman movies
[4:12:37] <stukamod> Affleck face jpg
[4:12:37] <+0neReeler> yes a franchise
[4:12:37] <dukenux> Another origin story
[4:12:41] <BigBlackBankai> I don't think it will be worse than Batfleck
[4:12:42] <sunnythedrunk> Can't be worse than Ben Affleck tbh
[4:12:44] <@Solidus_113> Just give Bruce a break
[4:12:45] <Doctadaking> How many times do we have to watch the Waynes/Uncle Ben get shot.
[4:12:47] <NoireRequiem> Ehh idm it‚Äôs just an alt universe to me
[4:12:48] <+DizzyGunner> the best thing they done with holland was not doing another origin story
[4:12:49] <@Solidus_113> It's Terry Time
[4:12:49] <puluxor> but who's the NEW JOKER?
[4:12:49] <BlackermanZX> christ affleck batman sucks ass LUL
[4:12:50] <dinnydanny777> Seems like Snyder Batman is just stupid memeshit
[4:12:50] <au_d3n> George Clooney is actually a pretty good Batman choice to me
[4:12:53] <jorniev> woolie
[4:12:54] <$emptyantics> @ashenjuan25 11/10 casting
[4:12:54] <rosemon5001> thats a lot of not money talk woolie

[4:14:01] <ashenjuan25> Just do beyond and bring back Keaton as old Bruce
[4:14:03] <MrDoomtastic44> Spider-Man could have been solved by Sony not squeezing out the ASM movies to keep the rights. We could have just gone straight to whichever MCU Spider-Man instead of a second one that people never got into

[4:24:41] <user_naim> They see, and then they hear. Like Paige
[4:24:42] <NoireRequiem> that's the tough thing about detective vision, it's hard to tell who can see you
[4:24:48] <NeoseekerStitch> No, he's just telling them where Batman left a body
[4:24:54] <keankong85> thats it, take them quietly, wait for others to find, let them fear you

[4:25:02] <+Crippl3> the SONIC BATARANG does
[4:25:03] <%rottingpastry> @Doctadaking It also gives you more range if the gargoyle is really high, but it comes up like once in the whole game
[4:25:05] <dukenux> hanging down cause bats geddit
[4:25:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> throw the sonic where you want to lure em

[4:27:35] <%Jiggisnipe> too fast
[4:27:42] <%rottingpastry> @MrAtheGreat You don't have to hang to do an inverted takedown
[4:27:43] <user_naim> Man City has some improvements

[4:30:24] <+zepelinnn1> not his fault tho LUL
[4:30:25] <Manmush> but hes so dreamy though
[4:30:25] <tukds> Paralyze him from the neck down
[4:30:25] <%ThisIsLloyd> EXACTLY THANK YOU
[4:30:25] <+condemned_15> but the system tho
[4:30:25] <StarlitStunner> Ok Jason
[4:30:25] <jorniev> NEVER KILL except in origins
[4:30:26] <dinnydanny777> There's literally a dead guy to the right of the screen LUL
[4:30:27] <coreybom> @commando_joe Fuck he going to do?
[4:30:28] <%krispen_wa> I CAN'T KILL. ONLY KILL INDIRECTLY
[4:30:28] <Mirrorcatch> is this the trolley problem with extra steps?
[4:30:28] <GarbageNirvana> At least paralyze the clown
[4:30:29] <Doctadaking> Don‚Äôt go down this path Woolie. Keep your emotions in check
[4:30:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:30:29] <huskarl_zap> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey Woolie goes full The Shadow
[4:30:30] <Halospaz117> @Wofoeh If you look closely, you'll see an apple hit his windpipe mid fall
[4:30:30] <@Solidus_113> ALL LIFE MATTERS
[4:30:30] <+LvckyLvc> Batman with that heat
[4:30:32] <+BritishTyrannosaur> But batman fans hate when batman kills so he can't
[4:30:32] <+zaitje> guns are cowards weapons Woolie
[4:30:32] <Hawkbone_> This shit again.
[4:30:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> JASON TODD NODDING
[4:30:34] <peachy996> How many problems would be solved if Gotham just instituted the Death Penalty?
[4:30:35] <unthought> That shirtless guy looks like Savant
[4:30:37] <%RaziWraith> I mean if it was that easy, a cop would've killed Joker by now though.
[4:30:37] <Wild_Samurai> Batman would get a Netflix Documentary in his Universe
[4:30:37] <+MrAtheGreat> But then Joker would win!
[4:30:38] <dinnydanny777> If he killed Joker the Dr and that guy would have lived LUL
[4:30:39] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Bruce Wayne can hit him with a sports car and get off in any court.
[4:30:40] <+zepelinnn1> not his direct actions, not his fault LUL
[4:30:41] <%Radioactivetaco9> this entire game wouldnt have happened if he killed joker instead of bringing him in
[4:30:43] <@Commando_Joe> @coreybom throw a baterang?
[4:30:44] <+ezgoldar> yeah but like the police said those people were nothing
[4:30:46] <+mczarklesby> See, when people say Batman's just as crazy, they aren't kidding.
[4:30:46] <Hawkbone_> Yes, because thats missing the point.
[4:30:47] <Treyu000> it's against his philosophy
[4:30:50] <a1rfighter> If Batman kills Joker, Joker wins.
[4:30:51] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus You are hanging out with Franky Castle a little too much Woolz
[4:30:51] <%saladin1911> For real tho, fuck Batman's morals. Sometimes, you just have to kill an evil clown NotLikeThis
[4:30:51] <mudamudajo> But, killing is evil woolie. Morality INTACT.
[4:30:51] <+0neReeler> drones huh.. how many innocents?
[4:30:51] <thelivingglitch307> Gotham could have saved so much trouble by enacting death penalty
[4:30:52] <+vaderxyz1970> But Woolie the moral high ground though
[4:30:52] <%Dante_Namikaze1> it's not Batman's fault that the Joker keeps killing people it's the government not giving the Joker the death penalty
[4:30:54] <+CptBritches> Batman is a bigger indirect murderer than every other villain besides Joker
[4:30:54] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT DEATH SENTENCE
[4:30:55] <MrDoomtastic44> @peachy996 I mean, it solved all crime forever in real life
[4:30:56] <NoireRequiem> Woolie advocate of GUN of course dislikes Batman's anti gun stance
[4:30:56] <dork_doggler> Have you any idea how many comics are just "someone tries to shoot the Joker" it's ridiculous.
[4:30:57] <%Irridium> *Zack Snyder has entered the chat*
[4:30:58] <+Crippl3> "This is the tool of the enemy. We do not use it. We do not NEED it."
[4:31:00] <stukamod> Old Detective Comics Batman would shoot his ass
[4:31:03] <%sporeian94> IF YOU KILL YOUR ENEMIES THEY WIN WOOLIE!
[4:31:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Zack Snyder laughs
[4:31:04] <coreybom> @commando_joe And joker still drops the poor man.
[4:31:06] <+Superbro64> its the moral victory woolie! think of the moral victory!
[4:31:07] <DatAsuna> batman is big blue boi
[4:31:08] <%BinaryFireball> how you feel is more important than what happens
[4:31:08] <Hawkbone_> MISSING THE POINT
[4:31:08] <%krispen_wa> INNOCENTS DONT MATTER. ONLY OUR GAME
[4:31:08] <%Javaa01> It's about the PRINCIPLE
[4:31:09] <Rhinoprotoss> Why doesn't Batman just win?
[4:31:09] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @AWKWARDL0SER
[4:31:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> JASON TODD LIKED THIS COMMENT
[4:31:09] <BlackermanZX> But my bat code tho
[4:31:09] <+Damie904> Woolie his batarangs can kill. Imagine chucking a knife at someone's neck.
[4:31:10] <jorniev> WHY ITS ALL UP TO BATMAN
[4:31:11] <stardustcrusad3r> batman is gonna age so bad
[4:31:11] <lotharrio> Well Batman is insane. So don't try to logic it.
[4:31:12] <@Menitta> What if you found the guy who kept tying the people up in the trolley problem? Would you kill him?
[4:31:15] <%NorthGrizzly> How about Gotham just excuted him
[4:31:16] <+cicatjb> naw man law says he gets another chance
[4:31:18] <NoireRequiem> Zack Snyder was right eh?
[4:31:21] <peachy996> In such a crapsack Gotham why isn't there a Death Penalty
[4:31:23] <%saladin1911> @sporeian94 NO THEY DON'T. THEY DIE.
[4:31:25] <user_naim> You just have to give him time to plan
[4:31:26] <lonosi55> theyre done playing??????
[4:31:26] <maskeddudej> its a disorder at this point
[4:31:26] <%sporeian94> Zack, we live in a society unironically, Snuder
[4:31:29] <dork_doggler> Keep going you can beat it tonight
[4:31:30] <huskarl_zap> Episode name: The Shadow was right
[4:31:31] <+StooEsq> somewhere, Zack Snyder has just activated
[4:31:33] <+chiazam> Why is Joker never on Death Row?
[4:31:34] <%jinking79> less deaths than Man of Steel
[4:31:35] <Wild_Samurai> It was you. Zack Snyder was Woolie all along!!
[4:31:36] <Viewtiful_Rose> Good session boys
[4:31:36] <Wofoeh> Meanwhile Frank castle is like "Haha gun go brr" and actually getting shit done
[4:31:37] <prime_name> Those headphones bounced
[4:31:38] <@Solidus_113> Detective vision says THEY'RE DEAD
[4:31:39] <%NorthGrizzly> Where the does the CITY say okay he got to go.
[4:31:40] <%Lion_kun> woolie, you are a hero
[4:31:40] <jorniev> HOW has the state not executed joker already
[4:31:41] <DatAsuna> next session probably last
[4:31:41] <NoireRequiem> @NorthGrizzly exactly, tbh it's the laws fault there
[4:31:42] <+ChancellorOfLights> no matter how many lives you save, people will tell you you didn't do enough
[4:31:42] <user_naim> Best LP, best session. Thank you Woolz
[4:31:42] <kulmoth> :)
[4:31:43] <dukenux> whats weirder is that no olse made Joker have "an accident"
[4:31:44] <Hawkbone_> People who say Batman should Kill Joker have never read a Batman comic in their lives
[4:31:44] <rytisone> But you cant invent new villains every month for a new comic
[4:31:45] <+Superbro64> @lonosi55 they started at 12 dood
[4:31:50] <lonosi55> bruh they only played for an hour
[4:31:53] <Sloavon> That would be an INJUSTICE!
[4:31:54] <coreybom> In fairness, If batman does kill the joker, then why should the other criminals be safe?
[4:31:57] <MrDoomtastic44> The criminally insane generally don't get executed irl
[4:31:57] <thelivingglitch307> "All the people I killed by letting you live."-The Dark Knight Returns
[4:31:59] <samuelfisk> No because Zack Snyder‚Äôs Batman kills hired security guards and doesn‚Äôt kill the Joker
[4:32:00] <kulmoth> great stream, thank you woolmeister and reggie :)
[4:32:02] <NoireRequiem> @Sloavon ayyy

[4:32:12] <sunnythedrunk> Probably 2 more
[4:32:13] <Hawkbone_> @lonosi55 5 hours, actually
[4:32:14] <sunnythedrunk> yeh
[4:32:16] <lonosi55> this is why it takes them 3 months to finish a 10 hour game
[4:32:16] <+AWKWARDL0SER> It‚Äôs a slippery slope Woolie you kill the mass murdering clown next thing ya know ya kill a jaywalker I mean come on!
[4:32:17] <user_naim> 1 or 2 more
[4:32:18] <peachy996> 2 maybe 3 if you hit a wall
[4:32:19] <coreybom> @lonosi55 ? Please be joking?
[4:32:20] <dekkitout> How is it that Scott and Zach (no relations) Snyder haven't collab'd on a Batman story?
[4:32:26] <DatAsuna> maybe 2, if puzzle confuses happen
[4:32:27] <+Superbro64> @lonosi55 the vod is literally 4 hours long dood
[4:32:28] <Wild_Samurai> is Woolie gonna live react to the Snyder Cut?
[4:32:30] <BlackermanZX> nice session
[4:32:32] <+Superbro64> stop smoking
[4:32:34] <picanoturna> good hustle
[4:32:34] <NoireRequiem> munch time
[4:32:37] <+condemned_15> time for pizzagetti
[4:32:39] <unthought> Remember when Joker was on Death Row for a crime he didn't commit and Batman proved his innocence?
[4:32:42] <waffleandman> arkham asylum is a short game
[4:32:42] <mudamudajo> Get some gyros
[4:32:50] <%saladin1911> Same. Probably gonna eat noodles...
[4:32:51] <%kullumanati> Countdown to Disco
[4:32:51] <%NorthGrizzly> Snyder Cut is going to be such shit
[4:33:07] <NoireRequiem> @NorthGrizzly Ikr can't wait!
[4:33:09] <Wofoeh> Batman: If you kill a murderer, the number of murderers stays the same; Frank Castle: but if I kill 10000 murderers, the number drops 9999 right?
[4:33:14] <BlackermanZX> Check out this new twitch "brand safety score" shit
[4:33:15] <dinnydanny777> Joker caught you using footage from JOKER TV
[4:33:41] <$emptyantics> @wofoeh This is why I love Frank
[4:33:45] <lonosi55> sugoiPunpun2
[4:33:51] <%Stupid121v2> Give Woolie your free prime subs he deserves then
[4:33:52] <+thedisablednerd007> gonna do the whole series with origins?
[4:33:53] <dekkitout> @dinnydanny777 That's what Punchline would fo
[4:33:53] <+Superbro64> sbfpRichard
[4:34:03] <%Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:34:03] <@akuda_bar> it's just so fun to say
[4:34:10] <DatAsuna> woolie is not sigma enough, yet
[4:34:11] <+allups> don't start rumors
[4:34:12] <%Jiggisnipe> Woolie would kill, remember that guard Kappa
[4:34:12] <%saladin1911> The jet?
[4:34:12] <prime_name> Woolie is more like Red Hood
[4:34:12] <Frodiddly> That's what batman would say tho
[4:34:14] <%Rixstarian> Rixstarian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Catching up on Reggie Souls anime. You guys have great banter & fair takes even when I don't agree. Keep up the motivation during the pandemic. Enjoying your content from down under.
[4:34:16] <NoireRequiem> Woolie is Red hood
[4:34:19] <coreybom> @wofoeh You know punisher is going to kill himself at the end right?
[4:34:21] <Hawkbone_> If you actually think Batman should kill Joker, you've clearly never actually read a Batman comic before
[4:34:21] <Doctadaking> Woolie is definitely Red Hood
[4:34:22] <+condemned_15> I heard Batwing is becoming the next Batman
[4:34:25] <peachy996> Meh I find Bruce way more interesting than Frank.
[4:34:31] <dekkitout> @condemned_15 His brother
[4:34:32] <unthought> How about Black Spider?
[4:34:36] <%kullumanati> Thanks Wools
[4:34:38] <+condemned_15> @dekkitout ah ok
[4:34:47] <%Stupid121v2> Woolie is more like the riddler but with racial innuendo
[4:34:47] <peachy996> And Frank never has a good rogues gallery because he kills them all lol
[4:34:48] <NoireRequiem> @coreybom, yeah he's not proud of what he does
[4:34:50] <DatAsuna> And garfield got replaced because he said tasm 2 was bad
[4:34:50] <%saladin1911> @hawkbone_ This is a dumb take but okay
[4:34:55] <+JonathLP> 20 grand
[4:34:59] <%Mattais88> Or they used to
[4:35:00] <@Solidus_113> Old Marvel was dumb
[4:35:02] <dinnydanny777> That explains why Spiderman was in the Avengers game then
[4:35:02] <+JonathLP> Sony got spiderman for 20 grand
[4:35:05] <dekkitout> He already had a two issue mini, teamed up with Nightwing, was on a League, etc
[4:35:09] <%Jiggisnipe> those marvel deals are awful
[4:35:09] <+FuqBoiSlim> Marvel really played themselves that day huh
[4:35:13] <+JonathLP> they could have gotten the WHOLE catalog for another 30 grand
[4:35:18] <BlackermanZX> it is really a shitty deal
[4:35:27] <dinnydanny777> Batman does not have to show up at all
[4:35:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Reverend_Roscoe
[4:35:31] <sunnythedrunk> At least Sony is putting out decent movies
[4:35:35] <unthought> Batman films need time to plan
[4:35:39] <DatAsuna> when's cassandra cain gonna get done justice?
[4:35:40] <dundore77> Doesn't WB own DC now? so they wouldn't need that stuff
[4:35:45] <Hawkbone_> @sunnythedrunk Good joke
[4:35:46] <NoireRequiem> yup Marvel was down bad, don't be a 90s Marvel
[4:35:46] <+machinetoys> Disney bought 20th Century Fox though
[4:35:46] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Remember: MARVEL WAS FUCKING BROKE AT THE TI.E
[4:35:47] <NeonBleu> WB: Get me gameplay of Batman!!!
[4:35:51] <DatAsuna> animated marvel is pretty trash yeah
[4:35:56] <DatAsuna> DC tho fantastic
[4:35:59] <coreybom> At the end of the day, If bruce does kill the joker, then why should someone like the riddler be allowed to live with his body count, or harley, or the other rogues?
[4:36:03] <Doctadaking> Under the Red Hood
[4:36:03] <%Jiggisnipe> yea DC is nailing that
[4:36:05] <mortificent> Except Killing Joke, don't watch it
[4:36:06] <%Mattais88> Animated DC is pretty great
[4:36:08] <@Solidus_113> Batman Ninja was fun but REAL dumb
[4:36:09] <dekkitout> The Snyderverse basically exists in animation
[4:36:13] <sunnythedrunk> @Hawkbone_ Hey man it's not evn close X-3 or apocalypse
[4:36:18] <inallcaps> Justice league unlimited is the GOAT
[4:36:18] <Lancaster_H> yeah DC crushes Marvel on animated in every single way
[4:36:18] <%Jiggisnipe> @coreybom kill em all
[4:36:19] <+allups> well u do now since that is a universe now
[4:36:19] <%Mattais88> Assualt on Arkham is amazing
[4:36:19] <$emptyantics> I wish Frank Castle dressed up as Batman and killed abunch of criminals to prove a point
[4:36:21] <DatAsuna> yeah killing joke a shit adaptation
[4:36:22] <+Gohyakuen> batman vs ninja turtles was great
[4:36:27] <%Javaa01> Yeah, DC's animated output is fantastic, and their cinematic output is almost entirely bad
[4:36:28] <Asuterisuku> Looking forward to to Yakuza tomorrow.
[4:36:28] <%Dante_Namikaze1> there's a lot of good animated movie whatever since Justice League War there is almost been just as many bad ones as well
[4:36:30] <dundore77> Or watch killing joke and skip the first half since the rest is fine
[4:36:36] <Hawkbone_> @sunnythedrunk Iron Man 1
[4:36:42] <$arcielardor> Fun fact: the computer I bought today cost as much as the scalper average for individual video cards.
[4:36:48] <peachy996> @emptyantics IS the point he's just a more efficient Red Hood?
[4:36:49] <JumpDriveProject> the arkham asylum cartoon is literally just suicide squad but great
[4:36:52] <dekkitout> Shoutout to Batman x TMNT
[4:37:00] <%Mattais88> Matt Reeves
[4:37:01] <NoireRequiem> @coreybom yeah none of his rogues gallery would be alive if we think joker should die. A good number of reformed criminals would be dead too
[4:37:02] <Doctadaking> Planet of the Apes guy?
[4:37:02] <%kewlmyc> Matt Reeves
[4:37:04] <karatetape> matt reeves
[4:37:04] <+condemned_15> Matt Reeves is directinh
[4:37:05] <Wild_Samurai> Matt Reeves from the Apes movies
[4:37:06] <mortificent> Matt Reeves
[4:37:06] <Abrupt_Jazz> matt reeves
[4:37:06] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Matt Reaves
[4:37:09] <coreybom> @jiggy_snipe Then batman becomes the punisher with money, and the punisher is NEVER the moral high ground. Hell, punisher himself admits.
[4:37:15] <%kewlmyc> He did the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy
[4:37:15] <dinnydanny777> someone said the planet of the apes guy
[4:37:16] <+condemned_15> Planet of the Apes trilogy
[4:37:18] <NoireRequiem> Planet of the apes guy
[4:37:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> the killing joke movie is terrible from beginning to end. the first half for being weird bullshit and the second for getting the tone and direction wrong.
[4:37:22] <+Damie904> It's not even Batman sould kill Joker. It's why isn't he on deathrow or worse at this point. Gotham itself is letting this happen.
[4:37:22] <dukenux> Planet of the Apes was good
[4:37:24] <sunnythedrunk> @Hawkbone_ Thor 2 is the same company
[4:37:25] <peachy996> Colin Farrel is Penguin, Zoe Kravitz is Catwoman
[4:37:26] <NoireRequiem> yup
[4:37:31] <+FuqBoiSlim> NO.
[4:37:31] <%kewlmyc> All 3 are great movies
[4:37:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:37:33] <dukenux> Apea together strong
[4:37:35] <DatAsuna> and cloverfield :/
[4:37:36] <stukamod> and Cloverfield
[4:37:38] <coreybom> Matt Reeves, the Recent Planet of the Apes films.
[4:37:39] <dukenux> Who?
[4:37:43] <BlackermanZX> cloverfield tho
[4:37:43] <+condemned_15> Andy Serkis is Alfred
[4:37:48] <Hawkbone_> @sunnythedrunk So is Infinity War and Endgame.
[4:37:50] <mortificent> woooow Felicity is oooooooold
[4:37:51] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Lisa Bonet‚Äôs daughter Zoe Kravitz plays Catwoman
[4:37:55] <%Jiggisnipe> @coreybom it's not killing because of the body count, it's because they keep breaking out of jail, prison., asylum. If you stay confined, no one would care
[4:37:57] <%kewlmyc> WATCH THEM. Are 3 are fantastic.
[4:37:59] <Doctadaking> Dawn is my favorite
[4:38:01] <JumpDriveProject> the planet of the apes movies are really good
[4:38:04] <NoireRequiem> You haven't seen the>
[4:38:05] <dukenux> Its a really solid trilogy
[4:38:11] <Hawkbone_> Saying Batman should kill Joker is fundamentally missing the point of Batman.
[4:38:20] <%rottingpastry> the Tim Burton movie?
[4:38:23] <phantalime> oh god the tim burton one
[4:38:24] <DatAsuna> give me the troy maclure stage play
[4:38:24] <%rottingpastry> Lincoln Memorial
[4:38:28] <+condemned_15> The Tim Burton remake
[4:38:28] <+eanscrale> That was forever ago
[4:38:31] <Doctadaking> Tim Burton with Marky Mark
[4:38:32] <@Solidus_113> Dawn Of The World Of The Planet Of The City Of The Apes
[4:38:32] <+thewellroundedgamer99> With Marky Mark?
[4:38:33] <dukenux> You mean Tim Burton movie? Oh noooo
[4:38:36] <dundore77> Yeah and the hot man on femchimp action
[4:38:38] <coreybom> The recent ape films are FANTASTIC. Its shows that he knows what he doing.
[4:38:38] <karatetape> that was tim burton
[4:38:40] <dekkitout> @Hawkbone_ *Too many writers*: BUT WHAT IF THO
[4:38:41] <mortificent> The Tim Burton Reboot
[4:38:42] <sunnythedrunk> @Hawkbone_ You're cherrpicking the out of 20 movies. Spiderman movies aren't bad
[4:38:45] <JumpDriveProject> Thats what happened in the originals as well
[4:38:47] <Wild_Samurai> In Arkham Asylum remember you can do a Takedown after any 5 hit combo
[4:38:48] <DatAsuna> Dr. Zaius Dr. Zaius
[4:38:49] <dinnydanny777> Yeah that movie's bad
[4:38:52] <coreybom> That was tim burton.
[4:38:59] <Hawkbone_> @sunnythedrunk Amazing Spiderman 2 says yes they are
[4:39:00] <BigBlackBankai> not connected
[4:39:02] <peachy996> Tim got bad after the 90s
[4:39:04] <@akuda_bar> straya
[4:39:04] <stukamod> Tim Burton been on a bad streak
[4:39:10] <peachy996> Sweeny Todd was great though
[4:39:12] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:39:16] <@akuda_bar> I thoguht he was gonna say "It takes a strong personality to survive in Australia"
[4:39:16] <DatAsuna> How dare you say that reggie? I'll kill you
[4:39:17] <jorniev> YES YOU ARE GREAT
[4:39:21] <@Menitta> Ah the good ol upside down donation
[4:39:23] <peachy996> Nowadays Tim has more bad movies than good
[4:39:24] <BlackermanZX> who knew
