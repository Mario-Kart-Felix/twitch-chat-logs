[0:01:22] <OldManDeckardCain> it's karma for pat's e0begging
[0:01:22] <%thechungiestofbois> says man who didn't buy a 3060
[0:01:26] <%ChoculaUltra> Like why the fuck do you even need more than 1 PS5 is beyond me unless you're intentionally being a shit lord reseller.
[0:01:31] <DXLelouch24> No LDK or Turbo on PC is bullshit

[0:02:03] <%thechungiestofbois> 711 in Canada
[0:02:04] <+DesertPenguin> I think 500 is gonna be the max for awhile
[0:02:05] <+MrAtheGreat> Xbox SeS is the cheapest next gen
[0:02:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Gee Woolie how come your mom lets you have two PS5s?
[0:02:09] <%Prevot> which is BULLSHIT
[0:02:16] <+dmtjinni> why reggie wearing lab coat? miss school yet?
[0:02:19] <%Irridium> so if the games are $70 then they're gonna stop doing season passes and micro-transactions right

[0:03:50] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @CappuccinoGuil Thats not a real place LUL
[0:03:53] <%ChoculaUltra> Can't wait for EA to boldly sell Fifa and Madden as $80 dollar games with no effort put into them LUL
[0:03:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> I’ll be over here playing 5 year old games whipDerp
[0:04:05] <Joestar1890> @amar_117 What about halo reach?
[0:04:11] <+jiggy_snipe> sell hardware at loss make up on software
[0:04:24] <yusefHD> Y'all remember that scene in House of Cards where frank goes "WHOA is that the new pee ess vitahh?" We need a show like The Boys to do something similar for the PS5 LUL
[0:04:36] <CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil Brazil is real, Acre is the place that's not real Kappa
[0:04:40] <%Irridium> PS4 was actually wasn't sold at a loss. It's why Sony made so much this gen.
[0:04:41] <%ChoculaUltra> Like we got games like Anthem and FO76 last gen, imagine the con jobs coming up for this next gen with the price hike? Wooo boy I cannot wait.
[0:04:42] <amar_117> he didn't play it in 12 days :(
[0:04:43] <+TheBimbollo> In Mexico the prices are 520 and 650, yikes
[0:04:46] <+TheotherKristian> @jetpackmcquack I'm gonna buy XBOXSEX to play Old gears of war games at 60fps

[0:04:54] <Redmannasah> @amar_117 bruh they finished reach?
[0:05:00] <%SilverDevilfish> Parents don't want to buy a console that costs as much as a 3080 Kappa

[0:05:30] <+jiggy_snipe> and accessories lol
[0:05:34] <phantomsleeves> nintendo boasting the cheapest console is so good for their sales
[0:05:40] <+rottingpastry> One Hour Photo
[0:05:43] <+chosenjuan42> controllers better not break like ps3 and ps4
[0:05:45] <@akuda_bar> yeah one hour photo
[0:05:48] <yusefHD> @akuda_bar LMAO One Hour photo
[0:05:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> $70 is horrid
[0:06:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Nintendo is basically creatively bankrupt tho
[0:06:06] <Zayasu> 80 € Kreygasm
[0:06:08] <yusefHD> Get in the photo booth Shinji.
[0:06:10] <%Solidnick18> those controllers better be amazing then
[0:06:15] <amar_117> why isn't it on YouTube NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:06:17] <$BallerSwagBro9k> No interesting game in ages
[0:06:22] <Redmannasah> @amar_117 If you're talking about the youtube videos, Minh said they're on the way
[0:06:22] <Joestar1890> I'm not paying $70 for the same or lesser product
[0:06:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Cheaper games because that shit adds up
[0:06:26] <%Irridium> controller better last longer than 4 fucking hours. goddamn piss-poor PS4 controller battery life
[0:06:30] <%CptnCampy61> How much are ps5 controllers?
[0:06:31] <%ChoculaUltra> Sorry, no free clout for Nintendo. They are out here selling 60 dollar LIMITED rom packs, I can't even defend that shit LUL
[0:06:37] <+chosenjuan42> Pat was right about $100 difference between physical and digital
[0:06:38] <santietch> woolie, did you live react to the playstation event?
[0:06:38] <+jiggy_snipe> cheaper games, you buy multiple games
[0:06:40] <%Prevot> I want both cheap
[0:06:50] <%SleepyDavid> i want expensive game for no micro transaction
[0:06:52] <BalloniWright> Cheaper Consoles, I barely buy games anyway
[0:06:53] <yusefHD> Where the FUCK is Chad Wardenn. We need him now more than ever..
[0:06:56] <Redmannasah> @amar_117 He was on vacation and he's back on it now, tho you could prolly just watch the vods
[0:06:58] <+rottingpastry> Depends how many games you buy, yeah
[0:06:59] <+DesertPenguin> Totally
[0:06:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> well, you buy the box once, while you buy the games more. Therefore the thing that you buy more should be cheaper
[0:07:02] <+DesertPenguin> If you keep up you want them cheaper
[0:07:04] <%mikesapartment> just in time for the midway point of the podcast
[0:07:05] <Zayasu> @ChoculaUltra it will be $70 next time Kappa
[0:07:05] <phantomsleeves> games go on sale mode often
[0:07:06] <+DesertPenguin> I prefer cheaper games
[0:07:11] <%RyTYoung> YAMERO
[0:07:12] <%Irridium> digital is so much cheaper even though a disk drive isn't that expensive is because digital will have no choice but to buy through PSN, where sony gets a cut on everything
[0:07:13] <+jiggy_snipe> @santietch kinda, he and Pat were on their RTX panel
[0:07:14] <%ChoculaUltra> If Chad Warden drops a video talking about the PS Quintuple I will lose my shit LUL
[0:07:26] <yusefHD> The ExBoks Series Dildo
[0:07:29] <+MrAtheGreat> Reggie man play more games
[0:07:30] <+DesertPenguin> Ming doesn't have as much time to game
[0:07:30] <+CookieCutter007> get that 3080 for flight sim LUL
[0:07:32] <yusefHD> shid looks like a deeeeeldo
[0:07:39] <+rottingpastry> I got physical because fuk it
[0:07:44] <amar_117> thanks for telling me about reach SeemsGood
[0:07:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil And Acre, it's not a real place. Look it up, it's super not real.
[0:07:55] <%ChoculaUltra> deeeeeeeealdo
[0:08:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> Help more people play :)
[0:08:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Im buying the PS5 so I can play God of War 5 and Miles Morales
[0:08:03] <MKII> games are getting more expensive to make but value per dollar for us isn't always that great depending on the genre
[0:08:06] <%Irridium> which, yeah, good luck digital people you stuck with PSN prices hope they go down at some point but just remember they literally don't have to you have no choice
[0:08:15] <santietch> @jiggy_snipe thanks for answering. Do you know how can i find the vod?
[0:08:18] <BalloniWright> @doomerskeletor13 Miles Morales is ps4 too i believe
[0:08:36] <%ChoculaUltra> I know 60 fps Spider-man will be nut inducing.
[0:08:40] <Redmannasah> ps4 had fuckin god of war, persona 5 and spiderman, i finally had to cave and bought one this year
[0:08:43] <+dmtjinni> weed 4 me tbh fam
[0:08:44] <%Solidnick18> @BalloniWright yep it is
[0:08:45] <%doomerskeletor13> @balloniwright Ye I know but it’ll look better on PS5 and be 60 fps
[0:08:55] <%ChoculaUltra> why couldn't they just get Insomniac to make that Avengers game too FeelsBadMan
[0:08:55] <yusefHD> Y'all hear that PS5 is apparently 99% backwards compat?
[0:08:55] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, I think the extra 100 for a disc drive will pay for itself after a few games. Get them used off Amazon or *shutters* Gamestop
[0:08:58] <BalloniWright> @doomerskeletor13 oh ok
[0:08:59] <+jiggy_snipe> @santietch Rooster Teeth said it would be on the Rooster Tooth website at some point
[0:09:04] <Visorak6> except for PC
[0:09:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> MOTIVATED
[0:09:08] <%doomerskeletor13> @balloniwright Also I wanna get the remaster of the first game for PS5
[0:09:09] <mrkatmonarchy> MOTIVATED!
[0:09:10] <+CookieCutter007> FeelsBadMan PC special edition
[0:09:14] <%Cerberus_NV> PC atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:09:17] <+DesertPenguin> It was inevitable
[0:09:18] <%Irridium> no PC :(
[0:09:20] <twoah> Spider Man: attack of the particle effects looks fun at least
[0:09:27] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[0:09:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> wait, pc is not getting a special edition?
[0:09:27] <santietch> thanks jiggy
[0:09:28] <OldManDeckardCain> pc already has special edition with mods LUL
[0:09:29] <%CptnCampy61> Worst kept secret
[0:09:37] <+rottingpastry> PC is being treated like last gen
[0:09:41] <+TheOneCalledRock> aww
[0:09:42] <+Vantesla> Some of the stuff Sony has done recently for consumer end has irritated me beyond belief. leaving less hype for PS5. still loved seeing Demon's Souls and more gameplay from other games shown...
[0:09:42] <MKII> ladies night not yet confirmed what's up with that
[0:09:43] <+TheOneCalledRock> fuck that
[0:09:45] <Joestar1890> P O W E R
[0:09:48] <yusefHD> Bang bang baaaang, *insert Pewdiepie nbomb * LUL
[0:09:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Capcom out here ruining the goodwill of the PC community that's whole heartedly accepted them with open arms with MHW's success on Steam is a wild wild business move.
[0:09:50] <%RyTYoung> Demon Souls looks incredible
[0:09:54] <%doomerskeletor13> DMC 5 Second Gig
[0:09:54] <phantomsleeves> is the nier remaster coming out for next gen or this gen?
[0:09:55] <+rottingpastry> My bet would be a separate release in like 6 months if at all.
[0:09:57] <+chiazam> The PC thing is a bit weird
[0:10:00] <CappuccinoGuil> We knew that you knew that we knew you knew
[0:10:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BUT GET HYPE FOR VIEWS WOOLIE LUL
[0:10:04] <+CookieCutter007> PC last gen FeelsBadMan
[0:10:07] <+jiggy_snipe> PC is every gen kinda, who here has an RTX card?
[0:10:10] <%SaiyanShoto> Honestly that was the worst kept secret, everyone knew it was coming
[0:10:18] <mrkatmonarchy> V as sin devil trigger
[0:10:25] <+Aldesso> i have 2070 super
[0:10:26] <@akuda_bar> @ChoculaUltra that is a crazy take
[0:10:28] <%Irridium> Capcom doing to the PC what Tecmo Koei did a while ago. Remember when Tecmo would just port the fucking PS3 version of their games to PC instead of the PS4 ones?
[0:10:28] <OldManDeckardCain> suck it pc master race, yall last gen LUL
[0:10:45] <yusefHD> Monster Hunter Rising Revengance
[0:10:50] <BalloniWright> PC Mains CarlSmile
[0:10:51] <+Vantesla> @phantomsleeves was announced originally for PS4.
[0:10:56] <Zayasu> FeelsBadMan
[0:10:58] <%ChoculaUltra> Is it that crazy of a take tho? How hard could it possibly be to just port over ALL of the SE enhancements to PC?
[0:11:00] <twoah> PC is last gen now. Just wait until PC 2 comes out Kappa
[0:11:09] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe they'll add it to PC later
[0:11:14] <+rottingpastry> Not that hard.
[0:11:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Until it does
[0:11:16] <MKII> a modder will hack those features if they have to. don't test them Capcom
[0:11:17] <%bread_assassin> What're the extra features gonna be?
[0:11:23] <yusefHD> *pc gamers in the chat lose their shit*
[0:11:24] <Visorak6> raytracing is feel good tech that doesnt amount to much
[0:11:25] <redrins> pretty reflections and light
[0:11:37] <OldManDeckardCain> if pc is so great, why isn't there a pc2? Kappa
[0:11:41] <phantomsleeves> @vantesla ty, guess we'll find out on the 24th if they change their minds
[0:11:44] <%ChoculaUltra> LDK, Turbo mode, raytracing support (which is wild because gpus had raytracing support before consoles but hey)
[0:11:45] <+Vantesla> water, reflection, glass, etc looks way more real
[0:11:54] <MKII> more realist light behaviour more importantly
[0:11:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:12:02] <MKII> realistic*
[0:12:04] <+CookieCutter007> less work more pretty
[0:12:08] <yusefHD> Curtains be curtaining
[0:12:09] <petwisk> hopping for a 120FPS mode
[0:12:12] <+TheOneCalledRock> they fucking made DMC4:SE and DMC3:SE on pc. why not 5? FeelsBadMan
[0:12:12] <yusefHD> Glass be glassing
[0:12:31] <%ChoculaUltra> and lets not forget how DMC5 pc launched with Denuvo that tanked fps on certain setups
[0:12:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> Fun stuff
[0:12:41] <+Aldesso> DMC 5 on pc already has turbo mode. Its called CHeat engine Spped Hack
[0:12:41] <+Vantesla> @theonecalledrock bet it is time limited and will come to PC eventually
[0:12:42] <%Javaa01> Basically, it's the secret sauce that makes CGI lighting look way better then vidya
[0:12:42] <+rottingpastry> They might make DMC5:SE for PC. It just isn't going to be DLC/an upgrade for regular DMC5
[0:13:05] <%ChoculaUltra> its just a bad move overall on Capcom's side. If it has something to do with dumbass console exclusivity even moreso.
[0:13:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> every time capcom does something good they gotta be like "however"
[0:13:39] <%Irridium> I wonder if they're just salty modders made playable vergil before them
[0:13:41] <%ChoculaUltra> So tired of publishers/devs re-releasing the same game twice when it could EASILY be dlc. Atlus is the biggest fucking offender.
[0:13:48] <+Vantesla> @choculaultra Sony threw a ton of cash for time exclusivity. pretty much how things been sadly
[0:13:53] <+Aldesso> not if it could be a reason for a console sale
[0:14:20] <%CptnCampy61> @aldesso Exactly
[0:14:29] <%ChoculaUltra> Sony is making money moves. While I might hate it I cannot dispute how successful it is for them.
[0:14:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> well atleast miles morales is coming to ps4 at a later daye
[0:14:29] <yusefHD> LUL
[0:14:32] <Stewbedale> LUL
[0:14:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> LMAOOO THE PC "CHADS" TAKE ANOTHER L
[0:14:41] <%masterfire23> 3080 = sold out
[0:14:57] <+jiggy_snipe> I think most developers prefer developing for console, it's one hardware you have to be concerned about
[0:15:05] <+jiggy_snipe> i.e. you don't have to optimize
[0:15:06] <%Prevot> I think Sony did pay for MHW exclusivity in Japan only, cause capcom didn't even bother with a Japanese pc version
[0:15:06] <yusefHD> Devil May Crynasty Warriors
[0:15:28] <%jinking79> 600$ to play Vergil on ps5
[0:15:29] <%Irridium> @jiggy_snipe well, that was the case. but now over in ol' Micrsoft land there's like 4 you gotta optimize for.
[0:15:39] <+TheOneCalledRock> inertia is the DMC4 machanic right?
[0:15:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> also BIG BUMMER that there's no Trish and Lady
[0:15:47] <+TheOneCalledRock> mechanic*
[0:15:48] <yusefHD> The game itself is 39.99 which is cool tbh.
[0:15:52] <+jiggy_snipe> @Irridium so is DMC5SE coming to Xbox SE S?
[0:15:56] <%Cerberus_NV> No Trish or Lady atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:15:57] <yusefHD> (I think)
[0:15:59] <+Aldesso> concentration gauge is back
[0:16:04] <AkumaHokoru> capcom capcomed us
[0:16:20] <%thechungiestofbois> More DMC high than Woolie?
[0:16:24] <MagicalBiscuit> Is that Diamond behind them with a D a hokage hat for Danzo
[0:16:30] <%BisoromiBear> It's okay, the Vergil dlc will be free wherever HD Gamecube games are sold
[0:16:30] <%ChoculaUltra> Capcom set the bar with DMC4SE. If 5SE is underwhelming they only have themselves to blame. Sorry not sorry.
[0:16:33] <+Vantesla> Sony should spend more on enhancements on PS4 to PS5 upgrades. especially on first party titles at least. given many for "free" with plus for PS5 now...
[0:16:42] <AkumaHokoru> no danzou didnt have a d on his hat
[0:16:47] <%Irridium> @jiggy_snipe Yes. I think. It's coming to the SEX and Microsoft is saying all Xbones will play all games so I have to assume so
[0:16:49] <BigManLugan> dmc5 combat lead working in ff16 tho
[0:16:53] <yusefHD> What if Street Fighter 6 is taking so long because it's going back to 2D Sprites? Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:16:55] <MagicalBiscuit> @AkumaHokoru i was just shitposting :p
[0:16:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Im not worried bcuz I trust modders to put in that content
[0:17:09] <%Javaa01> There's *very* little on consoles that you can't get on PC
[0:17:12] <+DesertPenguin> Exclusives
[0:17:16] <BalloniWright> Imagine if Vergil has Balrog but he used a different Boxing Style Kreygasm
[0:17:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PC has the largest collection of games
[0:17:24] <CappuccinoGuil> Xbox has retro compatibility, that's the reason I'll get it. Ps5 doesn't *shrugh*
[0:17:28] <diontmack> weird since dmc5 is very good on pc
[0:17:31] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm gonna be so fucking sad if Elden Ring ends up a console exclusive of some kind.
[0:17:34] <+MrAtheGreat> Btw, did any one else get an AU vibe from how Vergil's line of "Would our paths be the same if things had been different?" started that trailer?
[0:17:45] <+Vantesla> PC will always have more. that is never debatable.
[0:17:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @ChoculaUltra They wouln't dare
[0:18:20] <yusefHD> Y'all talk about the Demon's Souls trailer typo? LUL
[0:18:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @BallerSwagBro9k they dared for bloodborne though
[0:18:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer600 howdy guys. The Miles Morales game looks sick, can’t wait to play it. Did you see that the Ultimate edition comes with a remaster of the first game? Apparently it’ll have updated textures and character models, run at 60 fps and include 3 new suits with all the DLC. Gives me an excuse to replay it for the 5th time.
[0:18:37] <OldManDeckardCain> bold of you to assume that elden ring is coming out ever LUL
[0:18:42] <+Aldesso> who is publishing elden ring again???
[0:18:48] <+jiggy_snipe> Demons's Souls to PC PogChamp
[0:18:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> @ChoculaUltra demon souls remake will say otherwise
[0:18:56] <%ChoculaUltra> I have hope dammit, Elden Ring is REAL. Let me have this.
[0:18:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[0:19:00] <+jiggy_snipe> nope that was a type
[0:19:04] <+jiggy_snipe> typo*
[0:19:06] <yusefHD> @Aldesso Pretty sure Elden Ring is just a few literal demons who sold their souls to try it, and are trapped. We're never getting it.
[0:19:19] <%jinking79> unless it a fighting game
[0:19:25] <+jiggy_snipe> DMC: Vergil Edition Kappa
[0:19:26] <twoah> Georgie’s writing process for GoT is being used for Elden Ring apparently
[0:19:32] <+Vantesla> @aldesso pretty sure Namco Bandai just like they did for Dark Souls
[0:19:37] <+Superbro64> vergil was in ULTIMATE mvc3 too
[0:19:48] <MittensBroadcast> they dont have to double buy, vergil is going to be dlc for ps4
[0:19:49] <%dreadd_wolfsbane> dreadd_wolfsbane subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:19:51] <%doomerskeletor13> You can get the DLC instead of buying the Special Edition right?
[0:19:52] <MittensBroadcast> and xbox
[0:19:53] <+jiggy_snipe> MvC3: Vergil Edition Kappa
[0:19:54] <+Aldesso> namco is the elden ring publisher right. I could def see timed exclusive for the highest bidding console
[0:20:10] <+Aldesso> i could also see Elden ring going to Epic Gme store
[0:20:16] <+TheOneCalledRock> @doomerskeletor13 ye you just only get virgil, none of the extra features
[0:20:22] <phantomsleeves> is there any difference between the dlc and the ps5 version?
[0:20:29] <+Vantesla> @doomerskeletor13 DLC for special addition will be available
[0:20:30] <%ChoculaUltra> From Soft isn't a stranger to taking exclusive deals either. Bloodborne, Activision got that Sekiro deal too iirc.
[0:20:39] <+Superbro64> I cant wait to buy the Girl's Night Out dlc as a 30-40$ purchase in 2022 Kappa
[0:20:44] <%RiseKujikawa> woolieT
[0:20:55] <AkumaHokoru> hail big yeetus
[0:21:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> the dlc is just virgil, the special edition comes with a lot of extra stuff like turbo mode and graphics enhancements
[0:21:09] <%Irridium> @phantomsleeves PS5 has Legendary Dark Knight Mode and Turbo mode
[0:21:15] <+Superbro64> dmc5 on steam is going to be review bombed for sure though, shame
[0:21:15] <+jiggy_snipe> Elden Ring as exclusive depends on the publisher
[0:21:23] <%SleepyDavid> woolie would sacrifice the demons souls remake for dmc5 dlc
[0:21:28] <+rottingpastry> It should be review bombed tbh
[0:21:31] <%ChoculaUltra> we gonna talk about how Capcom ripped some of Hitchhiker's ideas LUL
[0:21:36] <OldManDeckardCain> dmc5 is already review bombed
[0:21:41] <Zayasu> modders > capcom
[0:21:43] <yusefHD> Five Nights at Fuckboys with that friggin Raytracing
[0:21:43] <AkumaHokoru> capcom can eat a dick
[0:21:44] <armchairmaster_> @sleepydavid dont put that evil on this world
[0:21:45] <AkumaHokoru> period.
[0:21:51] <huskarl_zap> crapcom small pp energy
[0:21:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> Why do you refuse to gain power?
[0:21:58] <AkumaHokoru> if you dont want modding. then do right by your customers.
[0:22:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> P"Chads" can't stop taking Ls woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:22:13] <+rottingpastry> Like I almost bought DMC5 on Steam a couple weeks ago. I would have been pissed if I got this news two weeks after buying the game.
[0:22:15] <BalloniWright> That's Japan for you
[0:22:17] <+jiggy_snipe> they'll just stop bringing games to PC if they really hate it
[0:22:20] <%ChoculaUltra> Remember Capcom during the SF4 era? The absolute KINGS of on-disk dlc being sold to you.
[0:22:22] <+Superbro64> dmc mods are definitely in a greyer area than before now that this version of the game exists
[0:22:26] <AkumaHokoru> we are just gonna hack it.
[0:22:37] <+Mrbaconator> well if they don't like it so much then make the DLC sooner
[0:22:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> "if you wont give it to us, then we are going to make it ourselves"
[0:22:40] <yusefHD> *Indestructible SF4 Soundtrack intensifies*
[0:22:40] <armchairmaster_> Capcom Modding falls into two categories: sick reworks to entire fighting mechanics, or 500 bikini costumes for Jill Valentine
[0:22:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Capcom doesn't care about what fans as long as it doesn't step on their toes. e.g. that Megaman vs SF thing
[0:22:50] <+Superbro64> at least they didnt pull an nintendo, and dmca'd that metroid game before the 3ds metroid 2 remake came out
[0:22:53] <+Superbro64> that was fun
[0:22:58] <%Irridium> "they can't look at the files on the disk that's illegal"
[0:23:15] <+Vantesla> Namco Bandai who is publishing for Elden Ring will likely do as they did for Dark Souls series. not playing favorites while trying to do better for PC release. Since DS3 was better than DS2 and etc.
[0:23:19] <OldManDeckardCain> 500 bikini costumes for vergil tho LUL
[0:23:19] <+Aldesso> in other news. Monster Hunter Rise HYPE
[0:23:25] <huskarl_zap> check your bit rate
[0:23:36] <+k9nov> And then they did it again with that Mario BR
[0:23:46] <he1lhydra> hades 1.0 tho!
[0:23:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Capcom withholding DLC our of spite
[0:23:48] <+Aldesso> Sadly its not a remake of Tri with only the water fights left in the game like i wished but hey
[0:23:56] <huskarl_zap> >People still give sony their gibs
[0:24:06] <AkumaHokoru> a lot of the stuff in se was promised or offered as dlc before the SE
[0:24:11] <+Superbro64> @k9nov lets be real here. Ninty dmca's stuff regardless. The dates do align tho
[0:24:16] <AkumaHokoru> people knew they were gonna Se but capcom tried to downplay it
[0:24:19] <AkumaHokoru> that is insulting too
[0:24:21] <huskarl_zap> Those people deserve to "lose" their info and finger prints to "Hackers"
[0:24:23] <OldManDeckardCain> Monster Hunter: Rise Kujikawa is gonna be hype
[0:24:31] <+k9nov> Absolutely
[0:24:31] <yusefHD> Props to the Source Filmaker NSFW Scene LUL
[0:24:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> KINGS
[0:24:34] <+Superbro64> They never actually released it
[0:24:46] <+Superbro64> ffxv season 3 I think? It was cancelles
[0:24:50] <+Superbro64> and tabata left
[0:24:52] <+rottingpastry> What? Capcom was pretty adamant DMC5 would have no DLC.
[0:24:52] <%jinking79> shit did Overwatch 2 die
[0:24:53] <huskarl_zap> stream is CHOKING
[0:24:56] <%Javaa01> There's a VERY big difference between being able to fiddle with server CVARs and and an SDK
[0:25:02] <+Superbro64> mod tools never came to ffxv @woolieversus
[0:25:02] <twoah> MHW devs just mad that modders added real weapon designs to their generic bone weapons
[0:25:12] <AkumaHokoru> honestly i am sad when i see companies just toss shit at their fanbase then blame them for getting mad about it.
[0:25:15] <+jiggy_snipe> ?
[0:25:17] <+MrAtheGreat> Streams fine for me
[0:25:21] <+chiazam> One guy
[0:25:21] <%Solidnick18> huh

[0:25:24] <+DesertPenguin> gfrHolup

[0:25:26] <GoTeamVenture03> stream been fine the whole time
[0:25:32] <Rashnam> that's a one guy right there

[0:25:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:25:58] <+ManOfReason> yeah preorders are dumb
[0:25:58] <%ChoculaUltra> oh wow, whoever said DMC5 was getting review bombed already was totally right. The Steam store page is going off rn LUL
[0:25:58] <+jiggy_snipe> you know guys, you can be patient
[0:26:03] <huskarl_zap> its better right now
[0:26:04] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie will just hunt the console on launch with his katana in hand LUL
[0:26:05] <GoTeamVenture03> master366Haha
[0:26:07] <%BinaryFireball> get it if you can get it
[0:26:15] <+Superbro64> They planned mod tools, I remember, with images of golf as an example. The game DOES have workshop support, which may be something else.
[0:26:16] <%jinking79> wait for ppl to break their ps5
[0:26:17] <yusefHD> He reads everything honestly. I think it's just about what he comments on. For instance. Babbabooey
[0:26:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BUT I WANT IT NOW THO - PatStaresAt
[0:26:20] <%bread_assassin> From what i gather, Walmart jumped the gun and the rest of them had to follow suit.
[0:26:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> Buy product own product
[0:26:28] <AkumaHokoru> had to reload
[0:26:34] <+rottingpastry> Walmart being assholes, what a shock
[0:26:37] <%Irridium> you're totally right I'm just salt
[0:26:40] <+solzan2000> I think this is the last time we getting disc based console
[0:26:45] <%BinaryFireball> i somehow got the ps5 but the 3080 is just fucking gone
[0:26:52] <+Superbro64> mod tools were planned to be released after the ardyn dlc pack, after which that season pass was cancelled. This was years ago regardless
[0:26:54] <+ManOfReason> pre orders are actual mindless consumerism
[0:26:57] <%Irridium> but also, maybe don't say you'll give advance notice then give zero notice
[0:27:00] <%CptnCampy61> It was a shit show though
[0:27:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @BinaryFireball what about the 70?
[0:27:12] <+rottingpastry> tbh Sony had nothing to do with it.
[0:27:18] <%BinaryFireball> don't want the 70
[0:27:19] <+solzan2000> and the price of games now ouch
[0:27:28] <%BinaryFireball> so didnt try
[0:27:34] <+solzan2000> its moving me to PC even more
[0:27:50] <%mikesapartment> play the game
[0:27:50] <+rottingpastry> Walmart just said fuck it. The twitter account was literally like, "What you expect us to wait? Fuck that!"

[0:28:22] <yusefHD> My uncle's ex wife's dog told me that Fall Guys is coming to Switch
[0:28:23] <armchairmaster_> I preordered a PS5 cause Demons Souls looks great, and 540 is more cost effective for me than the large amount it can cost for PC parts.

[0:35:49] <Visorak6> batman beyond was too good for us
[0:35:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @SleepyDavid venomized spider gwen tho Kreygasm

[0:35:54] <%Solidnick18> batman beyond Kreygasm
[0:35:55] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AMaidIndeed
[0:36:00] <petwisk> there's a N64 Batman Beyond game
[0:36:05] <HeroToxiko> beyond was so good it became an important part of triple joker LUL
[0:36:07] <+Chronobot> NO, INFINITE BRUCE WAYNES
[0:36:08] <petwisk> and It suuuuuucks
[0:36:10] <%bread_assassin> Robert Pattinson should've been Terry McGinnis.
[0:36:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Comic fans don’t like change
[0:36:16] <%spodebroker> He's 34
[0:36:19] <Greatwave123> scway
[0:36:23] <+rottingpastry> So how bad is Gotham Knights gonna be?
[0:36:26] <%ChoculaUltra> stop saying he should be Terry, dude is fucking 34
[0:36:28] <%spodebroker> He could've been a good Terry like 10 years ago
[0:36:30] <$emptyantics> Robert P. should have been Terry
[0:36:49] <OldManDeckardCain> give edge a shot
[0:36:50] <+Aldesso> No said the White Exec in his ivory tower
[0:36:59] <yusefHD> I want a game where you play as the Flash that could be speedrun in twelve seconds. $79.99
[0:37:05] <brunoberserk> OOOOFF
[0:37:05] <%ChoculaUltra> there's a hundred other young actors that could be Terry - Robert Pattinson is not one of them in 2020 LUL
[0:37:08] <+TheKippusan> @rottingpastry probably as lackluster as Avengers.
[0:37:10] <%Solidnick18> pretty much
[0:37:10] <%jinking79> i remember when Miles became the new Spiderman ppl hate it for the dumbest reason
[0:37:14] <Reckless_Rob> @rottingpastry Oh come oooooon, I hope its gonna be good :)
[0:37:15] <%SaiyanShoto> Personally I like Miguel over Miles. Comic book Miles is awful
[0:37:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> 4Head
[0:37:22] <Loinclothiclese> HADES IS OUT BABY
[0:37:28] <%doomerskeletor13> @jinking79 Lotta racists still hate him lmao
[0:37:37] <%bread_assassin> Just give him a quick shave and he could pass being much, much younger.
[0:37:40] <+Aldesso> apperently its shit
[0:37:47] <+rottingpastry> But how many people remember Spider-Man 2099?
[0:37:47] <%ChoculaUltra> Miguel O'Hara really doesn't get the respect he deserves in mainstream spidey fandom FeelsBadMan
[0:38:00] <Joestar1890> @SaiyanShoto Hear Hear, Miguel is great
[0:38:10] <yusefHD> Y'all need to just vibe out and microdose.
[0:38:20] <%Irridium> I really wish the quest wasn't going to require a facebook account in the next year
[0:38:24] <+rottingpastry> but I wanna macrodose

[0:38:54] <+Kyoshikei> Does Mihn have a twitter??
[0:39:04] <@akuda_bar> whatve you been using it for
[0:39:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Ye he does
[0:39:12] <Joestar1890> @rottingpastry Idk, but he's got some play in some spider-man video games, the Ultimate Spider-Man tv show, and in Into The Spider-Verse
[0:39:15] <armchairmaster_> If we're gonna be on tech talk for a while, does anyone know what's a good external SSD memory drive to buy for the PS5?

[0:39:49] <%ChoculaUltra> Miguel's popularity went up after Secret Wars folded all the universes together tbh.
[0:39:55] <%Irridium> @armchairmaster_ would be best to wait until launch. I remember sony saying it'd have to be as fast or faster than the internal hard drive to work with PS5 games

[0:41:14] <%doomerskeletor13> @rottingpastry That’s a great quote lmao
[0:41:19] <+jiggy_snipe> theoretically a late adopter should also have got it for cheaper
[0:41:19] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @emptyantics
[0:41:20] <%Solidnick18> um
[0:41:23] <%Livelinne> @reisadan Truely psaDogchamp
[0:41:23] <%Mr_Strut> But big number
[0:41:25] <Joestar1890> @ChoculaUltra What about when he was feautred in two Spider-man games, Superior Spider-Man, and comic Spider-Verse?
[0:41:28] <+primax104> FOMO is awful
[0:41:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BUT BIGGER NUMBER THO
[0:41:40] <%Solidnick18> yeah abit of FOMO
[0:41:42] <%Irridium> but new and shiny!
[0:41:43] <RayCSmooth> good way to go broke
[0:41:51] <verscoll> FOMO is terrible
[0:42:03] <+rottingpastry> Also Woolie has Pat to preorder 500 PS5s and hand him one.
[0:42:06] <yusefHD> no fomo LUL
[0:42:12] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @witchwoodstock
[0:42:16] <%JetpackMcQuack> the game is rigged
[0:42:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @rottingpastry Pat is his dealer LUL
[0:42:21] <OldManDeckardCain> fomo, more like mofo
[0:42:30] <witchwoodstock> opps sorry on my copy paste
[0:42:35] <%ChoculaUltra> @Joestar1890 oh for sure he's been getting recognition then. It's hard to explain but he's less of a "guest" character now and more of a mainstay if that makes any sense?
[0:42:42] <HeroToxiko> capitalism..... sigh
[0:42:53] <armchairmaster_> I usually don't get FOMO for games UNLESS it's something I'm super hype on. God of War and Ghost of Tsushima are two preorders I didn't regret. Hopefully Cyberpunk doesn't disappoint.
[0:43:05] <%ChoculaUltra> And damn do I miss Superior Spider-man/Superior Octopus FeelsBadMan
[0:43:14] <OldManDeckardCain> ah yes, blame capitalism for your terrible buying habits LUL
[0:43:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> OOF

[0:43:31] <%Irridium> this holiday's gonna be fun LUL
[0:43:35] <HeroToxiko> gift cards dawg
[0:43:36] <%BinaryFireball> I assume that the physical will come with codes?
[0:43:43] <Joestar1890> @ChoculaUltra I'd say he's been like that since 2014-2015, he's definitely not as obscure as he used to be, that's for sure.
[0:43:45] <yusefHD> No refunds cause of COVID lmfaoooo
[0:43:46] <+primax104> anyone with basic reading skills should not have this problem. but it will still happen
[0:43:47] <+Vantesla> grandparents for sure

[0:43:51] <armchairmaster_> @binaryfireball N O P E LUL
[0:43:52] <therealtacopancakes> that would be heartbreaking for the parents
[0:43:53] <TheBlackestBaron> Just like the WiiU gamepad fiasco.
[0:43:54] <MKII> they need to start selling digital codes on shelves if they haven't
[0:43:54] <%BinaryFireball> wow
[0:43:58] <%Solidnick18> the old gamer in me still want's the disc version
[0:44:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I CANT WAIT
[0:44:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> I'll blame capitalism all day for shitty sales tactics
[0:44:07] <Visorak6> how naive
[0:44:10] <%BinaryFireball> discs last forever
[0:44:12] <doofdotjpeg> XboneX Xeries S
[0:44:13] <Visorak6> to think retailers care
[0:44:16] <%ChoculaUltra> @Joestar1890 when I saw Spider-Verse in theatres, I was hyped as hell hearing the younger crowd know exactly who he was when he showed up in the post-credits stinger
[0:44:22] <armchairmaster_> It's gonna be fucking SICK hearing these stories
[0:44:26] <%KoopaPrez> KoopaPrez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 5 months of great POYO
[0:44:28] <+jiggy_snipe> at least say something
[0:44:29] <OldManDeckardCain> @JetpackMcQuack if people didn't buy they wouldn't work
[0:44:33] <+primax104> if they are ethical
[0:44:37] <%masterfire23> don't understand people laziness
[0:44:39] <yusefHD> Get some gift cards instead
[0:44:48] <Visorak6> caveat emptor, woolie
[0:44:49] <HeroToxiko> @BinaryFireball till they break or have a scratch inn the paint that ruins an instal
[0:44:50] <Zayasu> google top results: "where do i put the ps5 disc in?" LUL
[0:44:50] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:44:52] <Reisadan> No refunds for things that get touched frequently, like game consoles with controllers in them.
[0:44:57] <+jiggy_snipe> people's stupidity tho will always exist tho
[0:44:58] <+MrAtheGreat> Lmao. Gamestop's new policy is to try and sell physical copies WITH non-disk consoles
[0:44:59] <+rottingpastry> I wonder if the discs will come with codes for fools
[0:45:03] <+Vantesla> @jetpackmcquack capitalism isn't at fault more so corporatism with greed as it's guide while consumers act stupid.
[0:45:04] <+BomaZero> Little Timmy has to install his 200GB Call of Duty patch on Christmas too
[0:45:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Man, Moobot's been too trigger happy for my tastes. Let the people CAPS dammit.
[0:45:12] <yusefHD> The minimum wage option select PogChamp
[0:45:17] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time

[0:45:20] <%SilverDevilfish> Commission + Retail Fatigue = Fuck Little Timmy
[0:45:24] <+jiggy_snipe> yea just sell the gift cards too
[0:45:27] <Ashenik1> Woolie taht is not how capitalism works
[0:45:36] <Joestar1890> @ChoculaUltra I begrudgingly thank the Ultimate Spider-Man tv show for that. Unless they used the wiki like I did with Marvel's website as a kid
[0:45:38] <KaironFortressKnight> warning NO INCOMING GAMW
[0:45:45] <redrins> grandma gonna buy a diskless nintendo Kappa
[0:45:46] <%Mr_Strut> That would be the ethical thing to do, not the profitable thing
[0:45:49] <%gnoame> Do like PCPartPicker and flag it for incompatible
[0:45:52] <+jiggy_snipe> stores don't make alot of money from games btw so selling a physical isnt some huge profit
[0:45:59] <%vextalyst> That's a good way to look at things woolie i'd like to not still be salty
[0:46:00] <OldManDeckardCain> @JetpackMcQuack why would you respect idiots dumb enough to fall for it every time? respect is earned LUL
[0:46:05] <%vextalyst> I still am tho
[0:46:09] <%SaiyanShoto> From what I saw on the box’s the digital one does say it can’t play discs on the front

[0:46:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> @OldManDeckardCain Sorry you see your fellow man that way
[0:46:28] <yusefHD> Dude, Cineplex is pure capitalism too. They're telling people to wear masks, but are selling popcorn and drinks LUL fuck this world man.
[0:46:51] <OldManDeckardCain> ah yes, don't change yourself, blame the system only LUL
[0:46:55] <+Vantesla> remember debates on age ratings on M rated games still go on... People are stupid...
[0:47:03] <+DesertPenguin> I'm okay with that
[0:47:04] <VidulaSaix> Wowee

[0:48:03] <+brightman42> did minh skip World?
[0:48:15] <%Prevot> that's like saying MHW doesn't look like MH
[0:48:16] <AkumaHokoru> yeah i can wait and see because the special techniques started to use 3d more and more and those looked good outside of the sprite
[0:48:17] <KaironFortressKnight> it looks closer to the older games + World influemces
[0:48:19] <+Dr_DangerPhD> I was kind of hoping Switch MH would keep the smaller segmented levels but it looks good
[0:48:20] <enZymeth> [Bring me to life]
[0:48:21] <%Javaa01> Yeah they're putting it in a less lush environment, probably for performance reasons
[0:48:25] <KyaputenFarukon> graphically it looks similar to World
[0:48:29] <yusefHD> Switch Pro please jesus
[0:48:37] <Zayasu> i still have to play iceborne Kreygasm

[0:49:05] <+jiggy_snipe> ok that's fair
[0:49:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I DONT LIKE MH AT ALL
[0:49:13] <%ChoculaUltra> Reminder Nintendo is still selling joycons knowing full well everyone knows how the sticks drift.
[0:49:15] <+jiggy_snipe> super fair
[0:49:15] <LeBlanc233> wasn't my fav either
[0:49:18] <redrins> mh isnt just for you is all
[0:49:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> that's fair, MH isn't for everyone
[0:49:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> monster hunter is very much a game that's not for everyone
[0:49:18] <%paladinstarbuster> then thats fine
[0:49:22] <+brightman42> yeah, super fair
[0:49:28] <%masterfire23> how dare you not like the thing that i like D:
[0:49:29] <Blank9> monster hunter stories 2 looks good too

[0:49:33] <%Solidnick18> i tried mh4u and it bounced off me so i understand
[0:49:34] <%SaiyanShoto> That’s fine, not everyone has to like everything. MH is definitely not for everyone
[0:49:38] <yusefHD> Monster Hunter was one of those games I could never get into, but respect from afar. All good~
[0:49:45] <Tuna_Can_0> chat being reasonable DansGame
[0:49:46] <+amwaffle> Monster Hunter is worth trying, but it isn't for everyone.
[0:49:48] <+MrIntake> i just dont like how your character feels like a slug attacking LUL
[0:49:51] <%Lion_kun> You played badly
[0:49:56] <%CptnCampy61> That’s fine. That’s not that hot
[0:50:00] <+Vantesla> MH is still niche in many ways in entry. Even with the mass success of World.
[0:50:09] <yusefHD> Sunhilegend has singlehandedly saved the Character action series LUL
[0:50:13] <%ChoculaUltra> @geromester Reggie is looking like he could turn into a pickle rn, ngl

[0:59:13] <%CptnCampy61> This lady sounds hilarious in English. No accent whatsoever
[0:59:13] <RaidenRising> why is Jin batman now ?
[0:59:15] <CappuccinoGuil> "Fight back" says character who constantly says she wants nothing to do with the war
[0:59:36] <+rottingpastry> I mean, she's all in now lol
[0:59:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Just fight back peasant 4Head
[0:59:38] <brunoberserk> Yun : You should've fought back ... like my brother ... wait
[0:59:54] <+jiggy_snipe> Yuna fights til she can run but now that Taka is dead, she's all fight
[1:00:00] <+brightman42> they fear retribution
[1:00:27] <+rottingpastry> He should have ducked
[1:00:29] <redrins> he ran away therefore he's guilty Kappa
[1:00:30] <CappuccinoGuil> @jiggy_snipe but this is the mission you have BEFORE Taka dies, so at this point she doesn't have that mentality
[1:00:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Don’t make yourself slaves to the mongols, make yourself a slave to the samurais woolieMINHMAX
[1:01:25] <brunoberserk> a lot impaled bodies , we have some vlad fanboys here ...

[1:01:26] <+jiggy_snipe> @CappuccinoGuil Yuna was helping you fight this entire time until she could leave.
[1:01:30] <stevo_scar> sitrep on progress
[1:01:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, you gotta remember, you're asking the peasants to betray the terrorists to join the cops
[1:01:39] <+rottingpastry> Ditch diggers
[1:01:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> friendly fire: off
[1:01:55] <+Romuken> Catching up to yall's streams on youtube so I can't stay here, but wanted to drop in and say DK WEST DK WEST HE IS THE MAN HE IS THE BEST @WoolieVersus
[1:01:57] <+AWanderingKenku> Progress: Woolie is up to the Mamushi brothers
[1:02:12] <StoneAgedQueen> A innocent man would not have ran is all I am going to say
[1:02:14] <+Romuken> yo he looks absolutely sicc
[1:02:21] <StoneAgedQueen> Also @Romuken DK WEST OUT!
[1:02:21] <@akuda_bar> ASAB?
[1:02:27] <+Romuken> YAAAAAAAAAS
[1:02:27] <ralphfromdk> There is no such thing as friendly fire. As soon as you are hit, shit stops being friendly real fucking fast
[1:02:30] <CappuccinoGuil> @jiggy_snipe every time Jin says "you should fight back" she always says "I want nothing to do with this" so it's very hypocritical of her to say the same to her friend
[1:02:33] <+Romuken> EWAAAAH
[1:02:35] <%ChoculaUltra> Defund the Shogunate!
[1:02:36] <%doomerskeletor13> @stoneagedqueen god I hope you’re joking LUL
[1:02:49] <+rottingpastry> Deer are sacred on Tsushima. The Sakai armor has deer antlers. That's fucking weird.
[1:02:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but woolie my virtual steak tho
[1:03:01] <@akuda_bar> deer shed antlers naturally @rottingpastry
[1:03:06] <%jinking79> just remembering the XCON LP

[1:03:11] <Ashenik1> How do they know are you going to win?
[1:03:17] <+Romuken> Real quick, did they ever get the prize out of the box? Looked like it was gonna be a sword.
[1:03:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:03:34] <stevo_scar> @awanderingkenku thanks. saw the preview so wasn't certain how far he is
[1:03:36] <StoneAgedQueen> I would have simply snitched and stood still, you don't piss off a dog and entice it by running full speed
[1:03:40] <+rottingpastry> That seems like an unlikely source
[1:03:40] <Visorak6> man who would sell humanity out for a jetpack upset about friend who would sell countrymen out for good food
[1:03:44] <%ChoculaUltra> it wasn't a sword unfortunately FeelsBadMan
[1:03:44] <CappuccinoGuil> "you should betray the evil overlords" says man who, ON CAMERA, admitted he'd betray all of humanity for a jetpack LUL
[1:03:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Romuken they got all pieces, items were sword guard, mask, and coin
[1:03:53] <+Romuken> awh
[1:04:00] <Pappajimbo> this from "do we get jetpacks?" wollie
[1:04:01] <%ChoculaUltra> I think the last thing in the box was like a coin with the Sakai family crest on it?
[1:04:03] <%doomerskeletor13> Just resist your overlords peasants 4Head
[1:04:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but it's a dope mask
[1:04:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> "Your relationship with Woolie has changed"

[1:04:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> TOASTY
[1:04:17] <+Romuken> oh well. Now to silently catch up to see if they save Mr. Honor

[2:28:40] <+solzan2000> ouchhhh
[2:28:43] <VidulaSaix> Both of them are right in different ways
[2:28:48] <RaidenRising> woolie , DONT buy right now
[2:28:50] <RaidenRising> wait
[2:28:52] <hamahiroyuki> I will be better than the mongols if they're dead and I'm alive lol
[2:29:00] <+jiggy_snipe> ^
[2:29:02] <+GilroyGoldBlood> DO NOT BUY
[2:29:06] <%fatigued_driving> Bro please check the Kensei
[2:29:07] <VidulaSaix> Yeah dont upgrade yet
[2:29:10] <sugerik> why no buy?
[2:29:10] <%Irridium> cool hat for kensai tho
[2:29:13] <+zanzibar_junker> Stop
[2:29:21] <+rottingpastry> There's a lot to be said for not being dead
[2:29:35] <kenny_biff> sell your iron/steel for tons of supplies yo
[2:29:49] <+AsinPersuasion> talk to your allies
[2:29:50] <+rottingpastry> all the bamboo
[2:29:52] <Halospaz117> Ran right by Masako
[2:29:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so you can sell sword upgrade stuff for supplies now
[2:29:57] <%CptnCampy61> Save it
[2:29:57] <kenny_biff> minh waht??
[2:30:10] <+rottingpastry> Why?
[2:30:15] <Parapattern> I bet I know what Minh wants him to save it for
[2:30:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I like how they show how the lady is bending the bamboo to make a yumi
[2:30:18] <nintega010> This game tought people Samurai look cool, but no one wants to actually be one.
[2:30:22] <Pappajimbo> he totally expect that
[2:30:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> guys trust minh there's stuff to save for
[2:30:43] <+rottingpastry> ehhhhhh
[2:30:59] <$emptyantics> Aww yeah one of the best parts of the game coming up
[2:31:07] <+rottingpastry> I know what he's saving it for, but that other armor is better imo
[2:31:13] <ralphfromdk> For as big a buttface that mister "greatest archer" is, he has a nice outlook on reality in warfare
[2:32:01] <VidulaSaix> Well, if your people are afraid of their leaders that could do things like incite rebellion
[2:32:03] <%BinaryFireball> all the alive people will thank you
[2:32:05] <nintega010> Weeeeeeell Woolie
[2:32:25] <RaidenRising> she is in
[2:32:32] <+rottingpastry> Look at this hut!
[2:32:40] <VidulaSaix> HONOR
[2:32:48] <ralphfromdk> But muh honor
[2:32:53] <+AsinPersuasion> the hwaCHA
[2:32:59] <%BinaryFireball> chokonu?
[2:32:59] <nintega010> Honor is the most important thing to a Samurai
[2:33:03] <+rottingpastry> hwacha doin, Shimura?
[2:33:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> well, for a noble like Jin, it could mean losing you chance to inherit any property, and you'd have to sell your vassalship to another lord and HOPE he gives you a fief, essentially Jin would be a Ronin if he pisses off Shimura too much
[2:33:18] <%fatigued_driving> Yo Skelly appreciate the sub
[2:33:19] <redrins> nobunaga was super into guns
[2:33:23] <%masterfire23> deflect bullets
[2:33:25] <+jiggy_snipe> "stop spamming"
[2:33:26] <Parapattern> Open the Country. Stop having it be closed.
[2:33:29] <+rottingpastry> Samurai loved sneaky tactics and crazy weapons they would eat this shit up
[2:33:31] <Wolfwood315> that last samurai reference
[2:33:32] <$emptyantics> Remember when samurai would rape and assault innocent farmers? Such honour
[2:33:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Parapattern LUL
[2:33:44] <Wolfwood315> god I love that movie to be honest. I know it's cheezy but it's good
[2:33:48] <theotrainwreck> @Parapattern LUL
[2:33:51] <%Mr_Strut> Samurai are basically the kids who cried when they lost playground fights
[2:33:53] <+rottingpastry> Feudalism died lol
[2:34:00] <+rottingpastry> Well, was replaced with Capitalism
[2:34:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Samurais barely followed that code shit anyways, that’s all revisionist history
[2:34:11] <%BinaryFireball> which is now almost the same as feudalism
[2:34:11] <+AsinPersuasion> thats the greatest part about the game inventing samurai code before samurai code existed: we get to pretend none of the rape and murder happened
[2:34:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Wolfwood315 agreed
[2:34:25] <theotrainwreck> @BinaryFireball based

[2:35:21] <+AsinPersuasion> nope
[2:35:23] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:35:25] <+AsinPersuasion> ww1 was trenches
[2:35:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes ww1 used old war tactics with new tech
[2:35:28] <VidulaSaix> Are we having this musket conversation agaiN LUL
[2:35:31] <%Irridium> yeah trench charges
[2:35:34] <$emptyantics> Kenji BibleThump
[2:35:36] <%Javaa01> WW1 still had absolutely headass tactics
[2:35:40] <ralphfromdk> Woolie is right sadly, many armies did not update fast enough
[2:35:49] <%Irridium> where a guy says charge and you have to fucking sprint across open fields directyl at the enemy

[2:35:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Civil War
[2:35:58] <+GilroyGoldBlood> WW1 was new weaponry and old tactics. At least at the start
[2:35:59] <%doomerskeletor13> WW1 was a huge influx in industrial warfare
[2:35:59] <RaidenRising> ww1 was a trench war
[2:36:00] <redrins> oh you mean the french
[2:36:01] <bearwagon> LUL poor woolie
[2:36:06] <Pappajimbo> yes we had marches towards machine guns
[2:36:06] <+DesertPenguin> Musket just means the barrel isn't rifled
[2:36:10] <theotrainwreck> ww1 was not only trenches you knaves
[2:36:10] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL musket

[2:36:22] <%afronooch> punished woolie
[2:36:24] <+cheddie_gibbs> didn't Woolie say that years ago? That W1 had muskets lmao
[2:36:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't get hit*
[2:36:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie is right
[2:36:31] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:36:34] <Retinolgaming> French didn't adapt much after WW1 and that didn't go well for them.
[2:36:44] <Pappajimbo> chalvery did well in the eastern front though
[2:36:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, remember that Samurai bushido and honor is a bunch of revisionist trash.
[2:36:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yeah, exactly @redrins at the beginning of the Great War, the French were obsessed with the Cult of the Attack and lost many regiments to head on charges of German Maxims
[2:36:58] <jorniev> was the russian "dead men" world war 1 or 2 ?

[2:39:51] <RaidenRising> workers
[2:39:51] <nintega010> Terrifying everybody
[2:39:52] <Halospaz117> Probably just skirmishing

[2:41:31] <+solzan2000> its smart
[2:41:31] <+rottingpastry> one man's terrorism is another man's guerilla warfare
[2:41:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like phosphorous
[2:41:37] <+DesertPenguin> Everyone agrees some stuff is just "not cool dude"
[2:41:40] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:41:41] <VidulaSaix> Come back to FUUUUCK LUL
[2:41:47] <+AsinPersuasion> aight i'll be back in 2 hours for the boss fight
[2:41:47] <+solzan2000> to hell with "honor"
[2:41:47] <%Livelinne> LUL
[2:41:52] <$emptyantics> Give everyone CORONA CHAN
[2:41:52] <+cheddie_gibbs> LUL LUL
[2:41:54] <+JonathLP> "Might even come back to fuck"?
[2:42:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sieges are ridiculously costly and there is a good chance the sieged may be reinforced. The only downside of poison in this case is that it may ruin the water source of the castle for a while after the siege.
[2:42:06] <bearwagon> Altair vs Ezio here
[2:42:11] <RaidenRising> so is jin to huy who is ok with nukes ?
[2:42:13] <+chiazam> Quick and painless
[2:42:16] <Halospaz117> Bitch moves are the best moves
[2:42:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Back to FUCK
[2:42:21] <+DesertPenguin> Poison works well in Dark Souls so I'll allow it
[2:42:22] <%Prevot> drinking poison is a bitch move
[2:42:45] <Pappajimbo> but usa does that right now.
[2:42:47] <+chiazam> Bitch move ftw
[2:43:01] <CappuccinoGuil> The ONLY problem I have here is that the game wants you to poison a group of enemies that you could TOTALLY take on
[2:43:08] <+solzan2000> its smart
[2:43:12] <+AsinPersuasion> woolie's so good at stealth
[2:43:15] <sugerik> Interesting that this game is setting up "The quickest way to end the war with fewest casualties." as being the lesser of the two evils, especially since this is an AMERICAN developer that's set it in Japan. Considering... the end of WWII
[2:43:18] <+DesertPenguin> That's way too many
[2:43:32] <+rottingpastry> that should be an alarm
[2:43:50] <+rottingpastry> don't look a gift bug in the mouth I guess
[2:43:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ojama_Black i think at this point it's not just to off them but to scare the rest, and if the khan hears the fighting he'd run away
[2:43:56] <+DesertPenguin> "better of all your circumstances" never heard that one before
[2:44:02] <+jiggy_snipe> this method saves lives
[2:44:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Ojama_Black yeah, little on the nose, eh?
[2:44:16] <kenny_biff> that's called story telling, minh
[2:44:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Shimura is the ONLY one not on board
[2:44:22] <+solzan2000> they saw dead peeps?
[2:44:28] <VidulaSaix> Back up
[2:44:28] <%BinaryFireball> @CappuccinoGuil this is where I feel game and narrative clash. Game wants you to be superman where narrative has you as a mortal man
[2:44:30] <T_Sasquatch> Me :)
[2:44:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait sorry i meant that for @CappuccinoGuil
[2:44:41] <+ItsCaptainDisco> Shimura's the one that matters as Jito though, right? Chain of command
[2:44:44] <Halospaz117> Woolie where are you going
[2:44:48] <%Javaa01> You gotta go back up to the top of the tower

[2:45:01] <Nobuwaroo> there are 2 extremes and neither side wants to compromise
[2:45:02] <Halospaz117> WHY
[2:45:02] <%BinaryFireball> you can make the argument that the narrative also makes you a superman but the tone is too realistic for that imo
[2:45:03] <kenny_biff> woolie has no idea where he;s going LUL

[2:50:49] <VidulaSaix> Minh just casually plotting his own murder LUL
[2:50:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Next weeks episode: “Minh is no longer with us”
[2:50:52] <+ItsCaptainDisco> I want to die like a warrior and suffer in death as much as I have in life LUL
[2:50:54] <kenny_biff> how would anyone be fine with thst??
[2:51:01] <CappuccinoGuil> @T_Sasquatch retro compatibility + game pass
[2:51:07] <+chiazam> climb
[2:51:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Reggie taking notes XD
[2:51:14] <%Javaa01> @T_Sasquatch Yeah they're banking on Gamepass
[2:51:18] <RaidenRising> your brain can survive some seconds
[2:51:25] <T_Sasquatch> @cappuccinoguil yea but is gamepass good enough to beat exclusives
[2:51:33] <%EMP_SoloSagat> im built different i would survive a fall
[2:51:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @T_Sasquatch yup. 30 bucks for dozens of games every month?
[2:51:49] <+ItsCaptainDisco> If you get stabbed through the neck like that, you're suffocating to death, drowning in your own blood
[2:51:52] <shadowcrisis> What about being burned alive Mihn san
[2:51:57] <+chiazam> Does drowning hurt?
[2:52:03] <shadowcrisis> what are your eloquent thoughts
[2:52:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh my god, woolie is terrible at stealth games NotLikethis
[2:52:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Eaten alive and burning are probably the 2 worst deaths

[2:53:37] <T_Sasquatch> @cappuccinoguil I'm clearly not the target audience but I rather play an exclusive than multiplats . Being cheap with alot of games is eh to me
[2:53:43] <hamahiroyuki> the GhoooooSST
[2:53:55] <+ItsCaptainDisco> I advise listening to the Hu if you like Mongolian stuff
[2:53:59] <redrins> wuxia?
[2:54:01] <%fatigued_driving> Forced stealth in this game is mad frustrating
[2:54:06] <therealtacopancakes> use the rooftops
[2:54:19] <+chiazam> no
[2:54:22] <%CptnCampy61> Chimes help a lot
[2:54:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @T_Sasquatch right, now imagine you're a mother buying a console for christmas. Exclusivity also does not equate quality.

[2:55:11] <VidulaSaix> Remember that you have more tools than just Sword and Bow
[2:55:16] <+JoroNope> no, they all have to die
[2:55:16] <T_Sasquatch> @cappuccinoguil trueee I'm forgetting an audience of people wholy dependent on their parents
[2:55:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "is there a way to do this with rooftops?" immediately ignores rooftops
[2:55:19] <shadowcrisis> OR Splinter Cell
[2:55:22] <+ItsCaptainDisco> @fatigued_driving It definitely feels bad if you wanted to go for an honourable playthrough

[2:56:39] <%Mr_Strut> The original canadians

[3:07:41] <T_Sasquatch> @asinpersuasion its a class thing because he's passing off the blame to someone else due to her lower clasd
[3:07:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Jin you’re being naive, you’re never gonna get his trust back
[3:07:43] <+kewlmyc> Waifu > Uncle
[3:07:51] <SleepyMaribo> Fuck Honor, fuck the Code, We Ghost
[3:07:53] <VidulaSaix> @CappuccinoGuil He was being watched by the Shoguns entire army. What choice did he have?
[3:07:56] <%Livelinne> Snow?? In Tsushima???
[3:08:00] <CappuccinoGuil> "On second thought, leave ishikawa out"
[3:08:01] <+chiazam> "Bro, your uncle's totally going to kill you, time to run"
[3:08:18] <T_Sasquatch> "jin you're being naive" is basically the plot of this game LUL
[3:08:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Livelinne yeah, I know too, just embrace rule of cool
[3:08:31] <+zanzibar_junker> Keep playing
[3:08:47] <%Livelinne> @admiral_popnfresh aight PrideShrug
[3:08:47] <brunoberserk> woolieONEGUY
[3:08:53] <danknugglit> Damnit one guy
[3:08:54] <TallPixels> I feel like that's what parents would do though right? even if it's obviously wrong
[3:08:54] <%RiseKujikawa> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[3:08:58] <+jiggy_snipe> it's not mutually exclusive
[3:08:58] <%doomerskeletor13> One man
[3:08:59] <armchairmaster_> Yo Jin, you gotta GHOST before your Uncle goes full class-warfare
[3:08:59] <T_Sasquatch> Yuan Guay
[3:09:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @VidulaSaix What he was supposed to do is impossible to say, because we know what kind of person Shimura is. He did what he thought he had to. And he sucks.
[3:09:02] <%RyTYoung> TWO GUYS
[3:09:03] <VidulaSaix> Oh boy I got my turn to be One Guy LUL
[3:09:06] <Malik1002> woolieONEGUY plus woolieONEGUY
[3:09:07] <%EMP_SoloSagat> juan guy
[3:09:09] <+DesertPenguin> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[3:09:16] <%RyTYoung> @vidulasaix oh hey woolieONEGUY
[3:09:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no they hate you
[3:09:40] <VidulaSaix> @CappuccinoGuil The answer is that there was no right answer. The best choice he saw to make in that situation was to try and protect his family by throwing away some random
[3:09:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[3:09:43] <%Reveresao> She's using her womanly ways to play with your mind Jin!
[3:09:44] <%Livelinne> well at least the Dad wind is still blowing
[3:09:48] <%DashXero> woolieONEGUY
[3:09:49] <%doomerskeletor13> See, Kenji is a true bro
[3:09:54] <danknugglit> One guy is a lifestyle not a position
[3:09:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @VidulaSaix and that sucks. He sucks. End of story
[3:10:06] <+rottingpastry> "some random" like she didn't help save his life and when his castle back
[3:10:09] <VidulaSaix> @CappuccinoGuil The situation itself sucks
[3:10:12] <+rottingpastry> win
[3:10:16] <armchairmaster_> Dad Wind will never give up on his son, cause he thought the Ghost would have been DOPE.
[3:10:21] <+jiggy_snipe> Shimura could also condone Jin's actions
[3:10:26] <+chiazam> rooftops
[3:10:27] <RaidenRising> BUT HONOR
[3:10:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @VidulaSaix you get how sacrificing someone else is bad, right? Someone who's helped him out and saved his nephew.
[3:10:30] <VidulaSaix> It's compelling
[3:10:31] <%EMP_SoloSagat> ITS GREAT
[3:10:32] <+jiggy_snipe> and say this is a war lol
[3:10:33] <%Livelinne> LUL
[3:10:37] <VidulaSaix> @CappuccinoGuil I do yes
[3:10:45] <brunoberserk> BUT HONOR THO
[3:10:48] <theotrainwreck> fucking NO
[3:10:51] <Shade075> Yes
[3:10:52] <+jiggy_snipe> NO
[3:10:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> maybe
[3:10:56] <RaidenRising> nO
[3:10:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @VidulaSaix good. Welcome to the Shimura and Samurai suck gang LUL
[3:10:58] <+MrAtheGreat> probably not
[3:10:58] <%afronooch> no
[3:11:00] <Tuna_Can_0> KKona hell yea brother
[3:11:01] <VidulaSaix> As I said, there is no right answer to the situation.
[3:11:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It's not clear
[3:11:09] <%Livelinne> lytGROSS
[3:11:10] <VidulaSaix> @CappuccinoGuil The Shogunate sucks LUL
[3:11:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:11:19] <TallPixels> evil vs. evil
[3:11:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @VidulaSaix mah man
[3:11:20] <yusefHD> shimura is og
[3:11:32] <jorniev> stalin killed so many russians holy shit
[3:11:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> uh oh looks like uncle is in trouble
[3:11:36] <theotrainwreck> at the very least, it would have lasted a lot longer and US invasion would be a possibility
[3:11:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Eventually maybe? But historical hypotheticals are kinda hard to explore
[3:11:41] <+Aldesso> bankari?
[3:11:41] <%DashXero> Clan Oga would probably just die like bitches.
[3:11:42] <+Razputin217> The enemy of my enemy...
[3:11:52] <OldManDeckardCain> imagine trying to defeat socialism with socialism, haha, couldn't be allies back in the day haha
[3:11:54] <+rottingpastry> I mean, there's a pretty clear right answer imo. Win the war, suffer the consequences
[3:11:59] <CappuccinoGuil> TACTICAL ROLL
[3:12:05] <+AsinPersuasion> maybe if nukes were used in the european theatre? probably not still
[3:12:07] <%doomerskeletor13> @oldmandeckardcain brownW
[3:12:09] <+DesertPenguin> Stalin personally killed people with a literal hammer and sickle
[3:12:13] <theotrainwreck> seeing Russian casualties compared to literally every other country puts a pit in my chest
[3:12:13] <+AsinPersuasion> stallin as a necessary evil, oof
[3:12:18] <CappuccinoGuil> OH FUCK, THAT'S A GOOD LINE
[3:12:19] <+MrAtheGreat> stealthy

[3:12:50] <%EMP_SoloSagat> kage atpRtsd
[3:12:52] <VidulaSaix> Problem is the Samurai expect the enemy to also fight with honor. That's why Lord Adachi was burned and beheaded
[3:12:55] <theotrainwreck> also Stalin would have continued being just as evil without helping to defeat the Nazis
[3:13:01] <+MrAtheGreat> DD horse
[3:13:09] <Shade075> Nazi Germany was terribly run, probably wouldn't l;ast too long even if they didn't try to jump Russia
[3:13:14] <VidulaSaix> And as a result the citizens also expect the same thing from everyone
[3:13:18] <jorniev> D HORSE
[3:13:19] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:13:19] <+AsinPersuasion> that one never made sense to me because wasn't the khan running north either way? he didn't care about shimura castle at that point right?

[3:20:48] <+Razputin217> sbfpUno
[3:20:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT
[3:20:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> (Vomits blood in Japanese).
[3:20:50] <+MrAtheGreat> No, they just didn't think about it
[3:20:53] <VidulaSaix> They didn't even consider it until you did it to them
[3:20:54] <T_Sasquatch> They literally didn't know
[3:20:54] <+MrAtheGreat> They didn't know about wolfbane
[3:20:55] <%thechungiestofbois> they didn't know, you showed them new tech
[3:20:56] <%EMP_SoloSagat> they just didnt know lmaooo
[3:20:57] <+jiggy_snipe> they would use it but they didn't know about it
[3:20:59] <+rottingpastry> They don't know local poisons lol
[3:21:03] <%doomerskeletor13> no but they’re aware of it now
[3:21:03] <+chiazam> They didn't know
[3:21:04] <+AsinPersuasion> no but its like using nukes and then the enemy figuring out how nukes work
[3:21:04] <armchairmaster_> They didn't know until you poisoned them
[3:21:06] <%Livelinne> raquelGame
[3:21:08] <%EMP_SoloSagat> X copy that tech
[3:21:12] <TallPixels> what's worse, dying by poison or fire? I'll pick poison.
[3:21:17] <T_Sasquatch> Mine nowww
[3:21:19] <%thechungiestofbois> you basically thought them wavedashing
[3:21:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they saw it and went "oh shit that's cool how do it"
[3:21:19] <BlackermanZX> now WHO showed them the wolfbane since Jin killed them all doodWAT
[3:21:21] <+chiazam> They copied your flow
[3:21:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie lmao
[3:21:28] <+Aldesso> I mean they probably didn't know about the flowers effect until now
[3:21:29] <%EMP_SoloSagat> word for word bar for bar
[3:21:30] <%emperordread> KickDad
[3:21:40] <armchairmaster_> @tallpixels nah poison is internal, there's a SMALL chance you can survive a fire
[3:21:43] <RaidenRising> gandhi is going nuclear again
[3:21:50] <Pt_Kamen> logistic problems. All they needed was a local source to make poison, Jin showed them waht they could use
[3:21:53] <+MrAtheGreat> @BlackermanZX I just assumed they "asked" the locals after bringing a fw bodies
[3:21:57] <TallPixels> @armchairmaster_ How about being burned on a stake lol
[3:22:04] <%Livelinne> lytGULP
[3:22:22] <theotrainwreck> with the mongols thats pretty much accurate
[3:22:22] <armchairmaster_> @tallpixels absorb stake, use it to defeat your enemies and become a fire bender

[3:25:37] <+DesertPenguin> Are we in end-game?
[3:25:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Final Fantasy 15 past jumps
[3:25:55] <%RyTYoung> no
[3:26:04] <+MrAtheGreat> @DesertPenguin yes
[3:26:07] <VidulaSaix> Worst case you can just reload and finish them and just redo that quest in off stream time
[3:26:19] <+DesertPenguin> Doom Eternal was good about that but it was a few missions before the end so it caught me off guard
[3:26:22] <%RiseKujikawa> Kinda like when things go sour in P4G
[3:26:26] <%RyTYoung> It unlocks right before the end missions

[3:29:12] <T_Sasquatch> Pavlov'd your self LUL
[3:29:20] <Parapattern> What is UR Gamer fuel?

[3:30:14] <+DesertPenguin> Is Prosciutto high in fat?
[3:30:19] <+DesertPenguin> Lox
[3:30:24] <%xeromage> SALMON GAMNG

[3:30:37] <+Aeoneth> low carb eitherway though
[3:30:38] <+DesertPenguin> Canadians don't call smoked salmon = lox?
[3:30:46] <dinnydanny777> What is lox
[3:30:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:30:50] <+DesertPenguin> Lox is smoekd salmon
[3:30:54] <Parapattern> Jerky is great
[3:31:03] <dinnydanny777> We don't call smoked salmon lox in the UK either
[3:31:05] <T_Sasquatch> No rice NotLikeThis
[3:31:08] <Parapattern> Lunchables
[3:31:13] <+jiggy_snipe> I've only heard jewish people call it lox
[3:31:15] <+DesertPenguin> I think it's a Jewish/Hebrew thing
[3:31:18] <%emperordread> Good discussion - thank you guys
[3:31:20] <VidulaSaix> It's basically just board game in video game
[3:31:20] <Parapattern> Keto Lunchables
[3:31:24] <VidulaSaix> form
[3:31:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you need a decent sized group
[3:31:27] <T_Sasquatch> 2 yr old game LUL
[3:31:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Jewish*
[3:31:53] <T_Sasquatch> Turns out twitch really does make games popular
[3:31:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[3:31:56] <VidulaSaix> xqc played it
[3:31:58] <+jiggy_snipe> streamers I guess
[3:32:04] <TallPixels> wasnt there a popular gmod gamemod? Why all the noise all of the sudden
[3:32:16] <theotrainwreck> it is TTT with extra steps
[3:32:17] <dinnydanny777> Who started the fire?
[3:32:18] <OldManDeckardCain> dunkey was playing it before it was cool LUL
[3:32:19] <%Livelinne> psaBig collabs
[3:32:20] <VidulaSaix> Thats what I heard
[3:32:21] <nintega010> It was on mobile
[3:32:27] <hamahiroyuki> it's like danganronpa is what i heard
[3:32:28] <Parapattern> The Thing the game
[3:32:30] <T_Sasquatch> I don't think it's xqc
[3:32:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> INFLUENCERS DansGame
[3:32:35] <%emperordread> It's $4 on steam so I tried it, good fun
[3:32:43] <+jiggy_snipe> it was influenced Kappa
[3:32:46] <ChrisM341> Racial Draft PogChamp
[3:32:49] <%Irridium> it's a phone game yes but it released on steam 2 years ago
[3:32:50] <dinnydanny777> Idk who he is I just know he was featured in a struggle tweet once
[3:33:05] <Parapattern> Probably some VTuber
[3:33:06] <nintega010> It was fun watching Max & the dudes play it
[3:33:17] <T_Sasquatch> I'll be honest , Xqc's popularity makes no sense
[3:33:19] <%emperordread> It's like what you did to Dokapon
[3:33:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Big thing that it was a flash game ported to steam, Since flash is dying in december, it's good to get it
[3:33:22] <TallPixels> One word: Memes
[3:33:32] <VidulaSaix> Its a lot of fun but I feel like it has a very short shelf life. Few weeks and you pretty much exhaust the fun of it cause everyone starts metagaming it
