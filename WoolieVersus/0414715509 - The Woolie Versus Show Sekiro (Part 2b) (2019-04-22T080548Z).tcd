[0:02:36] <Latimew333> Woolie, I took like 12 hours to get past Blood Starved Beast in Bloodborne, 8 is nothing to be ashamed of.
[0:02:38] <+fatal_penguin_> @simpo98 Careful. I got bloody noses from energy drinks.
[0:02:44] <RoboXGP> stealth is just for killing
[0:02:48] <@mothmandraws> woolie no you must go for a plague playthrough
[0:02:49] <Mike_Mc> Have you done the bell yet?
[0:02:49] <%Aussie_Manny> So... you're PLAYING the game properly then. LUL
[0:02:55] <@mothmandraws> stare at bricks for lore
[0:02:55] <TrashLeviathan> just parry lol 4head
[0:03:00] <@mothmandraws> learn from the textures
[0:03:08] <tomboi193> Remember, Woolie, this is a sneaking mission. Try to remember some of the basics of Ninjitsu.
[0:03:15] <Dragon_Batman> LUL Plague's playthrough was a treasure
[0:03:21] <%QueequegTheater> Learn to cod--I mean parry
[0:03:22] <spiderously> can't wait for the SNEK!
[0:03:23] <%Aussie_Manny> I bet that leaf has a lot of lore written on it.
[0:03:24] <@mothmandraws> what is the lore implication of the moss on that wall
[0:03:27] <%Raefer> Raefer subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:03:35] <%ultimatetotoro> chat, did woolie beat dmc 5 yet?
[0:03:37] <%Aussie_Manny> ONE ON ONE
[0:03:42] <%QueequegTheater> @ultimatetotoro yes
[0:03:42] <DrunkenFlask> @woolieversus did you play off stream yesterday? Like a new game or was the last time you played the last stream?
[0:03:42] <RoboXGP> animals piss on south of trees
[0:03:46] <tomboi193> NYOOM
[0:03:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:03:48] <Crimsonaether96> use your byakugan to see all the enemies
[0:03:56] <Dragon_Batman> Yea they've fully recorded all of DMC5 I believe
[0:04:02] <@mothmandraws> "I could have taken that 1 on 1 there, but im a coward"
[0:04:09] <@mothmandraws> no honor, shameful display
[0:04:10] <+dukenux> Woolie ain't afraid to cheese it. Good
[0:04:10] <RoboXGP> to keep their junk cool
[0:04:17] <RoboXGP> they pee on the side facing the tree
[0:04:22] <VexicBayn> always cheese the first deathblow lets be real
[0:04:24] <%Raefer> Sekiro:cowards run twice
[0:04:25] <WG101> ninjas don't run away, they strategically retreat
[0:04:27] <Dragon_Batman> Good start
[0:04:27] <tomboi193> @mothmandraws Shinobi don't need honor
[0:04:29] <+KaiSnow> USE THOSE STAB COUNTERS BOY
[0:04:31] <%ChoculaUltra> honor is great and all, but not being dead is super great.
[0:04:32] <MatTrix77> Good thing he has short term memory loss
[0:04:38] <alexandrecau> Remember no shame in throwing ashes at his face
[0:04:42] <spiderously> cheesing it was Minh's idea
[0:04:47] <RoboXGP> sometimes it's better to react then dodge
[0:04:52] <%Aussie_Manny> uhh....
[0:04:52] <VexicBayn> the ashes are really stronk
[0:05:09] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> nice

[0:06:06] <%Raefer> you go in you stay in
[0:06:06] <freddystonejr> get deep in that ass
[0:06:09] <%Aussie_Manny> So it's very different from Bloodborne even. 🤔

[0:06:17] <+Hilleltaco> Gotta be apatBig brave
[0:06:18] <KazMkII> Is this the woolie Gits Gud stream?
[0:06:18] <+dukenux> keep pounding on his ass
[0:06:19] <MatTrix77> You need to be aggressively block
[0:06:21] <VexicBayn> hit the back from the front even
[0:06:29] <+CuddlyZombie> Try jumping off the bridge!!!
[0:06:34] <%simpo98> gonna assume its one Revive then respawn ?
[0:06:45] <spiderously> B E aggressive
[0:06:45] <dreu81> Yeah this is like a tweaked Bloodborne built around dark souls esque parrying
[0:06:47] <@mothmandraws> lets fighting love
[0:06:47] <alexandrecau> That's why there is no stamina bar, would be impossible to keep the pressure on
[0:06:52] <Sloavon> i sense psn trophies for this game having the lowest out of them all
[0:06:56] <mudamudajo> I've realized the hard way that this games wants you to be close and parry parry parry
[0:06:57] <danknugglit> been playing sekiro nonstop. fuckme this games rad
[0:07:01] <VexicBayn> 2 revives but not within a certain time period and they refill over time

[0:08:57] <spiderously> lure him with a shard and take him down
[0:09:04] <BusterRepukken> Shooter always spots you
[0:09:09] <Sloavon> so this game isn't shadows fashion twice right?
[0:09:11] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @mothmandraws considering nobody can cut three times in one fucking move I doubt it LUL
[0:09:11] <RoboXGP> he broke his first guard on a boss
[0:09:13] <KingOfTheGeats> that right side is a trap it got me the same way
[0:09:27] <+Thunderhog> This is some tetris 99 level of aggro

[0:10:30] <worldbrand> @HentaiSenpai9K I'd say no
[0:10:30] <RyuuAoi> People die HARD in this game. I wonder if you die just as hard. Has Woolie died yet?
[0:10:37] <@mothmandraws> sekiro lvl 2, starring the skulls parasite unit
[0:10:37] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus watch out, the enemy attack can clip through walls like in souls sometime
[0:10:37] <RoboXGP> basically keep moving forward until you think there's a boss
[0:10:42] <Holycow8498> Oh Woolies died a lot

[0:11:44] <doomerskeletor13> Woolie needs more POWER
[0:11:50] <BusterRepukken> i hate how shooters have a superhuman knowledge of where you are
[0:11:55] <RoboXGP> It's bush rush with annoying jobbers in between

[0:13:20] <TrashLeviathan> just do it perfect
[0:13:22] <+hoenhime344> here is my prophetic declaration. Wollie will be better than pat at this game. Wollie likes being defensive, he will block right out the gate
[0:13:23] <%CEGold> What have I missed so far? Just got back from grocery shopping
[0:13:24] <%LethargicRush> ya gotta use your nindo
[0:13:34] <Sloavon> BELIEVE IT
[0:13:39] <WG101> DATTEBAYO
[0:13:40] <+hoenhime344> and once he realises taht is jusy 1/2 the game, he will master parry
[0:13:45] <x1_Wolf> i thinl that you can parry bullets
[0:13:46] <Varanoo> RESTART
[0:13:49] <RoboXGP> Nah it took me six hours just to get ahead of them, this game is rigid
[0:13:52] <+hoenhime344> pat will to stubborn to change his play style
[0:13:52] <JanusII> Comes only once in a lifetime.
[0:13:54] <+KaiSnow> You can block bullets but not parry them
[0:13:57] <%Solidnick18> swift like the wind
[0:13:58] <TrashLeviathan> @hoenhime344 i think woolie just likes to parry
[0:13:58] <+Thunderhog> Honestly looking at this with minimal Souls experience, it's like taking already hard souls design while forcing you to take an MGS aproach to it
[0:14:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Executed with IMPUNITY
[0:14:11] <Sloavon> LUL
[0:14:11] <mudamudajo> woolie remember, you a damn shinobi. History's legendary coward. Use your cowardice to crush your foes.
[0:14:11] <MatTrix77> You see me creepin'?
[0:14:13] <%monkeyhous3> lol wth
[0:14:21] <@mothmandraws> "hey your that ninja"
[0:14:24] <spiderously> tease him with dat ninja ass
[0:14:26] <RoboXGP> gonna choke slam him?
[0:14:27] <MattHughh> i wanna play a good tenchu
[0:14:27] <Byr0nX> seems more stealth first and God help you if you get inna fight
[0:14:28] <+hoenhime344> and parrying is EVERYTHING in this game
[0:14:31] <TrashLeviathan> @mudamudajo but style tho
[0:14:31] <%Aussie_Manny> omg
[0:14:33] <%Solidnick18> alright
[0:14:38] <LeeOhX> What was that tech
[0:14:38] <doomerskeletor13> Just tease him a little
[0:14:40] <Quilltaz> i thought woolie was too brave to be a ninja sneakyman
[0:14:43] <RoboXGP> figure out which hand is his dominant woolie
[0:14:47] <%Aussie_Manny> woolieDATTEBAYO

[0:15:50] <BusterRepukken> @HentaiSenpai9K wont work
[0:15:50] <%monkeyhous3> this is alot more interesting than the past souls games
[0:15:51] <+KaiSnow> @HentaiSenpai9K you can only get a stealth attack once
[0:15:55] <Dragon_Batman> LUL he did say rorgular
[0:16:00] <+EySoyCoco> @HentaiSenpai9K you can only sneak on them once
[0:16:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Shame

[0:16:07] <BusterRepukken> @HentaiSenpai9K you can do it once, but if you leave and try again, they get their 2nd health back
[0:16:09] <RoboXGP> businju tenshin yata maru
[0:16:11] <TrashLeviathan> wait until he fights the guy with a eeuropean sword
[0:16:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> But understandable
[0:16:16] <+hoenhime344> @Tucker0603 in the first 10 min, yes/ he acts EXACTLY like snake in his dialoge. i almost think its an homage

[0:17:14] <%CEGold> "Now that I killed the shinobi, I'll stare at his corpse."
[0:17:15] <%monkeyhous3> shouldnt you wait till he turns his back?
[0:17:17] <Quilltaz> this game dont feel very souls to me, how different is it in general?
[0:17:17] <gustavozxd> I was training combos in dmc5 and the rorgular grunt fucked it all up LUL

[0:17:46] <+KaiSnow> With a stealth attack that would've almost been it
[0:17:46] <+starkandstag> 死
[0:17:47] <RoboXGP> if you not attacking block

[0:17:52] <+EySoyCoco> that was rad
[0:17:55] <RoboXGP> if you don't block dodge
[0:17:56] <spiderously> don't get greedy
[0:17:57] <%Solidnick18> you still would have had to do his other life bar
[0:17:57] <+hoenhime344> i FUCKING NEED those headphones
[0:18:00] <mudamudajo> woolie I know it's almost natural to dodge, but with enimes like him the dodge is not that beneficial. Parry parry parry my man.
[0:18:03] <Varanoo> @WoolieVersus Healing dragonrot is hard dude
[0:18:03] <TrashLeviathan> you can do it woolie
[0:18:03] <alexandrecau> try throwing items at his face
[0:18:07] <MatTrix77> You were licking your lips
[0:18:07] <+EySoyCoco> sneak on him once wool
[0:18:08] <%monkeyhous3> YOU NEED THE GREED
[0:18:08] <@mothmandraws> greed is good
[0:18:09] <+hoenhime344> GREED is a NESSESITY
[0:18:10] <glass_marcus> Greed is Good
[0:18:12] <%masterfire23> @woolieversus go to the training guy he will help you get better at fighting that guy
[0:18:12] <@mothmandraws> but greed will kill you
[0:18:13] <RoboXGP> attack or block
[0:18:13] <Ravenian96> Never stop never stopping.
[0:18:15] <RoboXGP> pick one
[0:18:16] <freddystonejr> Need GREED
[0:18:16] <doomerskeletor13> Your parry will carry
[0:18:17] <+peanutsondabeach2005> greed is good
[0:18:17] <%CEGold> Throw dirt in his eye Kappa
[0:18:17] <dodgy_dingo_> timing and momentum init
[0:18:18] <Dragon_Batman> Smart greed
[0:18:18] <DrunkenFlask> Dude you got this woolie
[0:18:19] <Holycow8498> greed is good is this game
[0:18:22] <tag545> kill the scrubs then run. then come back for a backstab
[0:18:22] <Prism_Wing> That is a hashtag if I ever heard one.
[0:18:22] <TrashLeviathan> greed is great
[0:18:23] <+Thunderhog> Well greed and stealth cirGreed lytTASTY
[0:18:23] <KingOfTheGeats> you can't let them recover their poise
[0:18:26] <Byr0nX> sbfpWipeouts
[0:18:30] <+igodex13> true
[0:18:30] <@mothmandraws> full greed, never block or parry
[0:18:31] <MayorRev> Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.
[0:18:32] <$notcbo> did you play Nioh woolie?
[0:18:32] <@mothmandraws> just swing
[0:18:33] <freddystonejr> Need for Greed
[0:18:33] <JanusII> Sometimes respect is the wrong move.
[0:18:34] <x1_Wolf> But poise is the real enemy
[0:18:37] <RoboXGP> well know you know
[0:18:39] <+hoenhime344> the game is ABOUT parry. that is why its frustrating to watch Pat play it
[0:18:39] <Quilltaz> the samurai got so much poise, they are the biggest bois
[0:18:40] <+KaiSnow> @WoolieVersus FYI the less health they have, the slower they regain posture
[0:18:41] <MatTrix77> You need to be MORE greedy
[0:18:41] <bustawof> but is pot of greed legal here?
[0:18:42] <spiderously> not if his vitality is low
[0:18:43] <+worthlessboii> you could have sneaked him once right?
[0:18:44] <RyuuAoi> FEED THE NEED FOR GREED
[0:18:55] <%LethargicRush> picture a society where you dont use greed
[0:18:58] <@mothmandraws> there is controled greed woolie
[0:18:58] <MayorRev> 3
[0:18:58] <+hoenhime344> FEED THE NEED FOR GREED
[0:18:59] <gustavozxd> so this game is greed: Shadows die twice
[0:19:03] <Scales_Tipper> so, don't hesitate on openings then?
[0:19:05] <@mothmandraws> but it was smart move
[0:19:08] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, is that a Bud?
[0:19:13] <+Bananaking744> so it yu-gi-oh, got to play that pot of greed
[0:19:13] <TrashLeviathan> be agressive, b e aggresive
[0:19:20] <Dragon_Batman> I do think there is bursts of greed tho
[0:19:22] <Holycow8498> You have two skill points Woolie
[0:19:24] <RoboXGP> Are we going to see Punished Wollie today?
[0:19:31] <Holycow8498> They aren't rorgular grunts
[0:19:32] <%Solidnick18> everything should be taken seriously
[0:19:34] <@mothmandraws> lvl 1 grunt lvl 25 grunt
[0:19:36] <+peanutsondabeach2005> every grunt needs to be taken seriously when one can take you down to half in one hit
[0:19:38] <ScreamLord> The "grunts" can kill you in 1 combo
[0:19:39] <Varanoo> @WoolieVersus posture recovers SUPER SLOW at half health
[0:19:41] <%Solidnick18> expect grunts
[0:19:41] <%LethargicRush> those guys are some some rorgular enemies
[0:19:42] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @WoolieVersus you have the right idea, but its more about getting in the enemies face more than relentless attacking. You need to parry when your opponent reacts then attack when they let up.
[0:19:42] <gustavozxd> so they're not rorgular grunts?
[0:19:47] <doomerskeletor13> Not rorgular grunts
[0:19:48] <+CuddlyZombie> Does woolie know that holding block actually REGENERATES posture???
[0:19:59] <+hoenhime344> @leviathan666303 not aggressive. defensive but greedy
[0:20:00] <+CuddlyZombie> It’s very useful
[0:20:04] <tag545> kill all the grunts then escape for backstab
[0:20:06] <RoboXGP> m8 if you don't know by now, get good
[0:20:07] <RyuuAoi> They block shit, Woolie. Take them seriously!
[0:20:08] <Wildzide> The guys with the axe trip me because they dont get staggered
[0:20:09] <%Aussie_Manny> @CuddlyZombie nani the fucc
[0:20:15] <+CuddlyZombie> It’s true!!!
[0:20:17] <TrashLeviathan> i want to see woolies reaction to this games vergil
[0:20:19] <SouthPawPad> @WoolieVersus the more damaged your opponent is in general, the slower their posture recovers
[0:20:19] <+KaiSnow> You could almost certainly jump kill this guy
[0:20:20] <%LethargicRush> so you should parry everything instead
[0:20:31] <DrunkenFlask> @woolieversus i feel like you should take everyone seriously in this game since even a small mistake can cost you
[0:20:35] <RoboXGP> u should k d parry
[0:20:52] <%masterfire23> @go to the training guy and do the advanced trainings, they're really helpful
[0:20:59] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:20:59] <@mothmandraws> just be a genji main
[0:21:03] <@mothmandraws> go in and attack
[0:21:07] <Quilltaz> Hanzo
[0:21:09] <RoboXGP> just telling everyone the ramen noodle is up
[0:21:12] <A_DEAD_SHOW> DO COMBO WOOLZ
[0:21:14] <mccf> Mashing to get a parry increases your posture?
[0:21:16] <+MintMuffinGamer> The way of the Jostar's never fails
[0:21:17] <VexicBayn> uou can stealth kill on the wall, target a dude qnd throw the ceramic AT him and let them come im
[0:21:21] <Byr0nX> "pin him to the wall~"
[0:21:26] <RoboXGP> it's like donky konga
[0:21:28] <+CuddlyZombie> @woolieversus counterintuitively, holding block causes your posture to regenerate faster. Also those straw guys are weak to fire
[0:21:28] <%LethargicRush> WWVD?
[0:21:34] <Byr0nX> SLICE EM
[0:21:34] <+KaiSnow> It's stealthy once they're not alerted
[0:21:38] <tag545> assassins creed it. just go around picking off the grunts then stealth the boss
[0:21:41] <+KaiSnow> But there's no Sam Fisher ledge grab
[0:21:44] <Quilltaz> the baddies are pretty dang observant in this game
[0:21:44] <BusterRepukken> GOUGE EM
[0:21:45] <+MisterAngryEyes112> This aint assassins creed
[0:21:59] <BusterRepukken> reap.. what you sow..
[0:22:08] <RoboXGP> not really you should always run past them unless there's a item nearby
[0:22:08] <MatTrix77> No Escape
[0:22:11] <%Aussie_Manny> This is Arkham City.
[0:22:14] <tag545> then tenshu it then. same concept
[0:22:16] <ScreamLord> I hate enemies with no purpos other than ringing a bell
[0:22:24] <+tkfromthe90s> @WoolieVersus ...is it shitty to say that Sekiro just makes me more excited for Ghost of Tsushima?
[0:22:26] <%LethargicRush> this game is basically eastern tomb raider.
[0:22:28] <+Joestar_SSB> Hey chatroom. Hey Wools
[0:22:45] <+peanutsondabeach2005> can you do corner kills in this game? i saw it in the trailer but couldnt do it in game lmao
[0:22:46] <%Aussie_Manny> @tkfromthe90s yesss
[0:22:46] <Tucker0603> hope woolie can get into the castle tonight, there's some fucking rad shit
[0:22:46] <BusterRepukken> just SCHUM the boss, woolie
[0:22:50] <Holycow8498> cheeki breeki
[0:22:53] <+KaiSnow> @LethargicRush what lmfao
[0:22:55] <RoboXGP> ghost of tsushima will be a cake walk compared to this
[0:22:57] <+Joestar_SSB> Sup everyone
[0:22:58] <MatTrix77> Where ma prompts at?
[0:22:58] <ScreamLord> !motivated
[0:22:58] <@Moobot> 276 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:23:25] <RyuuAoi> One mo
[0:23:31] <+tkfromthe90s> @Aussie_Manny I am so ready for that game to be a thing, because I've missed Sucker Punch, and Sekiro keeps reminding me that it's gonna be a thing
[0:23:32] <WG101> biggest of greeds
[0:23:33] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> hewwooooo
[0:23:35] <mccf> big greed big kills
[0:23:44] <tomboi193> Now he's feeling motivated
[0:23:45] <%LethargicRush> but will it work against strength man?
[0:23:46] <RoboXGP> now instead of attacking pretend that's parry
[0:23:47] <%Solidnick18> sneak attack on big boi
[0:23:48] <KungFuStarfish> Evening all
[0:23:49] <+KaiSnow> Jump on his head
[0:23:50] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Thing is, most minibosses have superarmor
[0:23:51] <%Solidnick18> yee
[0:23:52] <+KaiSnow> and DEATHBRO
[0:23:53] <ScreamLord> @aiyobro Didn't we have similar thoughts for Sekiro?
[0:24:00] <Holycow8498> Now this parties getting crazy
[0:24:05] <%Solidnick18> Nani
[0:24:13] <GoldeNOVA> Woolie remember to check out your skills
[0:24:22] <+peanutsondabeach2005> use a stealth candy if youve got one woolie
[0:24:35] <MatTrix77> I wish mini bosses never forget
[0:24:36] <tomboi193> Remember to drop your shield...oh wait
[0:24:38] <RoboXGP> i played like nine hours in 2 days
[0:24:46] <RoboXGP> you just gotta parry!
[0:24:49] <+skylaryeah> stealth candies are really handy, yeah
[0:24:54] <%LethargicRush> just flatter the general and tell him he's doing a good job. then he won' want to fight
[0:24:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:25:01] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:25:05] <ScreamLord> Bitch you thought
[0:25:09] <+peanutsondabeach2005> you can sprint up pretty close before he really notices
[0:25:11] <TrashLeviathan> do it from the air
[0:25:15] <DrunkenFlask> If you can get a point off i think youll beat him this time
[0:25:16] <tag545> probably need to jump him
[0:25:19] <%TheOneUpWarrior> oh shit i just reset it lol
[0:25:21] <mudamudajo> @tkfromthe90s Not at all that game looks sick! Difference is this game kicks your ass to be badass, tsushima will make you feel badass all the time till maybe a boss or two.

[0:28:21] <tag545> early on just chip health to slow down recovery
[0:28:33] <+hoenhime344> probs dont wanna hold block at more than 70% posture.
[0:28:45] <ScreamLord> No seriously. IMAGINE a No Hit Run for this game!
[0:28:48] <RoboXGP> when his dominant hand is back he will hit
[0:28:53] <Quilltaz> this is wollies ninja way
[0:28:56] <RoboXGP> when his passive hand is down it's a swing
[0:29:10] <%masterfire23> @woolieversus visit the training guy
[0:29:10] <+hoenhime344> @ScreamingMeat io think it can be done fairly easy.
[0:29:16] <DrunkenFlask> @hoenhime344 blocking makes your posture recover faster though
[0:29:26] <alexandrecau> can you get an axe swing him for maximum poise damage?
[0:29:27] <Holycow8498> Woolie you have two unspent skill points
[0:29:33] <RoboXGP> sometimes it's easier too attack on a thrust
[0:29:37] <+Das_Prints> Some other options that might help but be tricky if you want to use items is hitting them with the fistfuls of ash is a stun. Same if you hit them with the fire barrel twice in a short period or once if you tag them with oil first.
[0:29:41] <%TheOneUpWarrior> when he switch hes to the left stance for the underswing just BIG zone him until it goes away that upslash is killer
[0:29:54] <+hoenhime344> @DrunkenFlask ehhhh you sure? im almost 999999% sure it comes back faster if you DONT block
[0:30:00] <RoboXGP> you gotta string the parrys
[0:30:01] <spiderously> spend your skill points
[0:30:06] <%Aussie_Manny> No mash! No mash!
[0:30:09] <KingOfTheGeats> You can use a shuriken to keep his poise up when you back down
[0:30:10] <+wwwwwww1> just don't get punished 4Head
[0:30:17] <Holycow8498> Are you saving up your skill points for a skill?
[0:30:21] <RoboXGP> you got it
[0:30:23] <RAH001> @WoolieVersus hey woolie. use sprint while ur footsie bosses. that shit changed how i play the game xD. i even sent you a tweet just in case u didnt see the message.
[0:30:25] <%TheOneUpWarrior> reseting and holding block brings your posture back quicker
[0:30:25] <DrunkenFlask> @hoenhime344 im sure, it said so in one of the loading screens
[0:30:30] <+DmanDoesThings> not panicking is hard
[0:30:30] <%Aussie_Manny> Mashing is for Bloodborne!
[0:30:36] <TrashLeviathan> just dont panic 4Head
[0:30:43] <mudamudajo> So massing block to get parrys feels right when we're anxious in a fight, but it screws us over with rasing our posture. As hard as it may sound you gotta relax and focus are the enimes movements and tells. It's scary, but very legit.
[0:30:44] <+DmanDoesThings> Just 4Head
[0:30:45] <Holycow8498> Woolie senpai noticed me
[0:30:57] <spiderously> you'll lose them if you die
[0:31:07] <GoldeNOVA> Waste them if you got them
[0:31:14] <RoboXGP> sometimes they're already dead
[0:31:26] <+KaiSnow> Oh no, my pot is getting cold!
[0:31:27] <RoboXGP> see
[0:31:34] <+Das_Prints> Saving up to get the bonus spirit emblem then the follow up that heals you on deathblow helps a lot during the early part to save hours charges and pellets.
[0:31:36] <+peanutsondabeach2005> what ive noticed is that enemies will almost always attack you right after they parry you so you can bait out an attack to parry
[0:31:37] <Byr0nX> ah muh breadsticks
[0:31:37] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> I HIGHLY recom.end
[0:31:39] <flawlessded> Oh man you've not even reached the first real bosses yet

[0:33:58] <mudamudajo> I'm very interested to see where this game goes when it comes to the dragonrot story element.
[0:34:09] <DrunkenFlask> Did it say he didnt have any applicable tools that move?
[0:34:18] <%Aussie_Manny> $$$$$$$
[0:34:19] <RoboXGP> now the bell ringer
[0:34:19] <alexandrecau> Two left
[0:34:25] <alexandrecau> one by the door
[0:34:25] <%TheOneUpWarrior> ya'll remember when this game was hyped as bloodbourne 2?
[0:34:33] <radregice> i love how you just vacuum up loot now
[0:34:37] <Vohs_Bru> Woolie is fighting game focus mode
[0:34:37] <alexandrecau> also the bell ringer but he won't attac
[0:34:41] <Holycow8498> There is also the front door guy
[0:34:49] <RoboXGP> the bell dude
[0:34:50] <Holycow8498> Yeah i remember when everyone thought this was Bloodborne 2
[0:34:50] <spiderously> don't forget the guy outside the door
[0:34:59] <+hoenhime344> @DrunkenFlask just looked it up, blocking attacks fills up YOUR parry gauge, not the enemy. parrying attacks fills the enemy up and does nothing you yours. holding block makes you move slower and will have a time frame to unbocl so you cannot parry while blocking.
[0:35:02] <+peanutsondabeach2005> yeah the loot vacuum is so onimusha its rad
[0:35:02] <mudamudajo> @theoneupwarrior His arm us kinda of a trick weapon though.
[0:35:03] <radregice> i'm kinda glad its this and not just bloodborne 2
[0:35:07] <lesbosmer> i love the ancient shinobi art of cash vacuum
[0:35:18] <radregice> as much as I love bloodborne
[0:35:18] <%Aussie_Manny> This is BuroduBoornu.
[0:35:22] <%Aussie_Manny> GOT EM
[0:35:24] <Bailey__gaming> what's Woolies progress? what arm things he got?
[0:35:29] <RoboXGP> it's fun but if you play it a 2nd time you'll still be bad lol
[0:35:33] <%LethargicRush> he gon get ya
[0:35:36] <YourStepdadsBrother> you are already dead
[0:35:38] <flawlessded> The bosses on this game make Bloodborne look easy. I'm glad it's not Bloodborne 2. I've been pleb filtered by one of the early bosses (Woolie not got there yet) all day
[0:35:42] <+hoenhime344> @DrunkenFlask blocking more than not blocking will open you up for attack and not let your posture go down
[0:35:46] <%TheOneUpWarrior> @mudamudajo true dat thts what reminded me of the Bbourne hype
[0:36:06] <DrunkenFlask> @hoenhime344 aah my bad, i was playing while sleep deprived and i guess i read it wrong
[0:36:18] <+KaiSnow> Ow.
[0:36:19] <%TheOneUpWarrior> grandmma butterflies don't play
[0:36:20] <%GohanEgret> woolie needs to put on his leaf village headband
[0:36:20] <%Solidnick18> oof
[0:36:21] <%Aussie_Manny> ouchies
[0:36:23] <Vohs_Bru> by watching 5 minutes of Woolies stream I can tell that Woolie is better than Pat in stealth in this game :)
[0:36:28] <Bailey__gaming> I find that the fire hand is really good
[0:36:33] <RoboXGP> i hope attack and dodge are your face buttons
[0:36:34] <nothuzad> woolie is still fairly early into the gaem @Bailey__gaming only like 3-4 (mini)bosses in
[0:36:34] <%Solidnick18> you got em

[0:38:32] <Dragon_Batman> That was a miniboss tho, still a win
[0:38:32] <+KaiSnow> There's way way way more minibosses in this game than main bosses. Very few main bosses honestly
[0:38:33] <%PowerfulBlackGangs> Always another mountain to climb
[0:38:35] <+CrunchySpoon> There is so much more
[0:38:35] <%Aussie_Manny> 🎊 🎊 🎊 🎊
[0:38:35] <Ristwach> Go
[0:38:36] <%TheOneUpWarrior> true dat the real boss was easy compared to tenzen
[0:38:39] <+starkandstag> the real prologue is just beginning
[0:38:40] <willjar313> Surprised I didn't join to find Woolie Bionic Commando-ing all over the fucking place.
[0:38:40] <spiderously> you'll ssssee
[0:38:42] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus you doing good so far man
[0:38:43] <%monkeyhous3> you cant enjoy your job woolie
[0:38:44] <tag545> divine sprinkles
[0:38:48] <TrashLeviathan> your bossfight is in another castle @WoolieVersus
[0:38:50] <BusterRepukken> dont go down there
[0:38:53] <+Link232> Considering how many mini bosses there are inbetween the real bosses, 'The real Sekiro starts here' applies for the entire game
[0:38:56] <Bennett_Fracture> still wish the game had pvp and co-op...
[0:38:56] <%LethargicRush> now you can go to new londo
[0:38:59] <+peanutsondabeach2005> hell yeah magic listerine strips
[0:38:59] <PleaseStopRyan> like straight up do not go down there
[0:39:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:01] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> TBH the mini-bosses aren't that mini

[0:39:04] <SeaReally> use it vs ghosts
[0:39:05] <%Rawpost> you'll know when the BIG boss shows up
[0:39:07] <YourStepdadsBrother> the real boss was the friends we made along the way
[0:39:09] <flawlessded> Any unique enemy in the game world with a name and two deathstrike points is a miniboss. Trust me, you'll know when you reach the first real boss.
[0:39:10] <striberx> So, how far is Woolie, on this?
[0:39:12] <Byr0nX> So its like that pkmn move for gen1 ghosts
[0:39:15] <tag545> but seriously is this anorlando

[0:39:29] <Bennett_Fracture> its more like a tenchu ninja assassin than a dark demon's soul...
[0:39:31] <mudamudajo> Legit you have not fought what this game deems a legitimate boss. It made feel bad when I found out after ouzo. :(
[0:39:34] <+Hilleltaco> Where the fuck you at ghosts

[0:43:49] <flawlessded> You don't get any more weapons as far as I know, you just get more tools for your prosthetic

[0:44:24] <spiderously> noooo....
[0:44:25] <vVAstrAVv> or big loases
[0:44:31] <BeauNavire> it'll mostly come from skills
[0:44:34] <RAH001> i agree with that actually. hopefully there is something that gives u an other reason to replay besides checking to see if u miss anything
[0:44:46] <%TheOneUpWarrior> there are secret skill trees too
[0:44:51] <+KaiSnow> I think depending on which skills you prioritize at the start definitely affects how it feels
[0:45:01] <+KaiSnow> And there's way way more skill trees you unlock later
[0:45:06] <%Aussie_Manny> Where is the variability in character progression?
[0:45:18] <spiderously> you can only bone home from here
[0:45:21] <%Raefer> i guess it depends if you know where to unlock the other skill trees early
[0:45:26] <DrunkenFlask> Plus there is no multiplayer to keep you going after you’ve done everything
[0:45:26] <Dragon_Batman> ooo piece of candy
[0:45:26] <BusterRepukken> manlet assassins
[0:45:31] <Holycow8498> Who do you think would win Willy from Nioh or Wolf

[0:50:33] <+Kurogane_Dread> It's basically Divine Blessing from Souls
[0:50:40] <+KaiSnow> die for our amusement
[0:50:44] <+Keith_Chop> headless isn't really weak to anything, you have to use the confetti and hope you don't die to terror
[0:50:47] <RoboXGP> it's a fungus it's made with water and roots
[0:50:50] <BusterRepukken> go back the other way

[0:52:48] <RoboXGP> gotta jump on the passive
[0:52:51] <+Hilleltaco> Gotta say, you did better than my first try
[0:52:52] <%Aussie_Manny> jeeeeeezx
[0:52:53] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Perfect parries stop it entirely
[0:52:55] <%PowerfulBlackGangs> Terror is so lame.
[0:52:55] <+KaiSnow> But you're out of Divine Blossom now
[0:52:57] <fabo_joyful> Mortis
[0:52:57] <tag545> TERROR
[0:53:00] <investorscratchit> DO IT
[0:53:00] <%Lion_kun> no more confetti though
[0:53:00] <+KaiSnow> So it's way harder
[0:53:00] <K9_TeamCaptain> Parry the Fear LUL
[0:53:01] <caja_de_ojos> spoopy
[0:53:01] <%Aussie_Manny> Terror go UP.
[0:53:03] <BusterRepukken> You need Divine Confetti to even damage him
[0:53:04] <RAH001> what kind of inuyasha shit was that
[0:53:04] <dmysta3000> Damn, you actually did pretty well against him
[0:53:04] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:53:04] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> @7c_nickel not yet
[0:53:09] <+Das_Prints> You need confetti to fight him though.
[0:53:12] <+Keith_Chop> they fucking trick you too with how fast they swing
[0:53:14] <TrashLeviathan> you dont have anymore confetti
[0:53:14] <+Keith_Chop> it's annoying
[0:53:20] <GoldeNOVA> ! TERROR !
[0:53:20] <Varanoo> @WoolieVersus It's not actually doable right now we were messing with you
[0:53:22] <%Raefer> the only time cowardice kills you
[0:53:22] <spiderously> you'll need more confetti
[0:53:23] <%Solidnick18> comeback later i guess
[0:53:29] <x1_Wolf> doable but spooky
[0:53:36] <+CharminglyMelancholic> @tygermom is there multiple confettis? I feel I may get my teeth’s kicked in
[0:53:37] <+KaiSnow> Well it is
[0:53:39] <+Keith_Chop> Technically you can
[0:53:41] <7c_nickel> Good, cause Grandma Butterfly is the hypest old lady ever.
[0:53:42] <RoboXGP> he still had like 75% to go
[0:53:42] <DrunkenFlask> It seems better to dodge him since blocking still builds up terror
[0:53:43] <+KaiSnow> Without confetti it's a pain in the dick
[0:53:45] <+Keith_Chop> you can definitely beat him
[0:53:50] <+KaiSnow> @DrunkenFlask you cant dodge in the mist
[0:53:50] <+Keith_Chop> you just gotta be good
[0:53:52] <+KaiSnow> you cant run
[0:53:54] <+KaiSnow> or dodge
[0:53:57] <DrunkenFlask> Fuck
[0:53:59] <BusterRepukken> You need to stock up on confetti
[0:54:03] <TrashLeviathan> theres a boss in the past you might appreciate @WoolieVersus
[0:54:05] <+Keith_Chop> every enemy in this game is beatable
[0:54:08] <+Keith_Chop> regardless
[0:54:08] <investorscratchit> Do it woolie
[0:54:10] <BeauNavire> then its a party
[0:54:12] <flawlessded> I can't wait to see him fight Lady Butterfly lmao
[0:54:12] <%PowerfulBlackGangs> Just like real life

[1:16:04] <RubberFistFight> @mrshazboto yeah he did. he didn't even get the jumpscare. Although in true Pat style, he immediately threw himself off a cliff with a resounding "OH NOOOooooo..."
[1:16:11] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Fun fact, Genichiro has the same JP VA as Seto Friggin Kaiba
[1:16:11] <jay521> think he assumed you'd die anyway
[1:16:17] <Dragon_Batman> It might be because he assumed you would bleed out
[1:16:23] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus he's arrogant
[1:16:26] <alexandrecau> Woolie cutting your arm off is a pretty good big murder, you just survived thanks to dragon blood
[1:16:33] <RoboXGP> You're nothing but a fourth rate duelist!
[1:16:42] <flawlessded> I've been trying to kill Genichiro basically all day. One time I got him to his final stage, but fuuuuck it's insane.
[1:16:46] <+KaiSnow> You're a third rate duelist with a fourth rate deck!

[1:31:28] <samuraijakanddaxter> there should be a wesley snipes blade game like this
[1:31:31] <%TheOneUpWarrior> such a good get in get out move
[1:31:39] <%GrabsTheClown> 1moku1 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:31:51] <%TheOneUpWarrior> nightjar saved me forever until i got ichimonji
[1:32:05] <+KaiSnow> It's not for this one, but the one after on the top
[1:32:12] <NeroInfinite> Fang and blade seems pretty rad if you want more follow ups
[1:32:12] <+KaiSnow> The heal on deathblow is SO nice
[1:32:18] <moogle_dood> Fang and Blade is really good
[1:32:19] <Dragon_Batman> It's for a future one I think
[1:32:33] <+djbsully> Nightjar won me alot of boss fights
[1:32:38] <RoboXGP> there's a counter and a recover in the other page at the tops
[1:32:40] <moogle_dood> That paired with the certain prosthetics is really useful
[1:32:44] <%TheOneUpWarrior> nightjar is clutch for sure
[1:32:46] <laguerrilha> Finally caught up with the vod, did i miss anything important?
[1:32:57] <worldbrand> The heal on deathblow feels like a good 15-20%
[1:33:04] <TrashLeviathan> you should go to the hirata estate for cool stuff @WoolieVersus
[1:33:05] <Tucker0603> @laguerrilha he killed horse boss
[1:33:10] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> He's gonna be healed by that sick horse smackdown you gave
[1:33:13] <+fatal_penguin_> Give her the Seed, son
[1:33:19] <+A_Real_American_Trash_Can> at least one can hope
[1:33:37] <+djbsully> Nightjar and SPINNING shuriken
[1:33:38] <+gerahwar> Remember your ninja way.
[1:33:47] <+MisterAngryEyes112> The shinobi MUST CONTINUE
[1:34:03] <%GrabsTheClown> woolieS woolieT
[1:34:04] <%GrabsTheClown> woolieF woolieU
[1:34:07] <+fatal_penguin_> It's sperm?
[1:34:13] <+Tbnero> doodBait doodBait doodBait
[1:34:20] <+BinaryFireball> this game made me sad. but watching woolz play will make it better
[1:34:21] <+ladomania> gotta plant that seed
[1:34:21] <laguerrilha> @Tucker0603 did he beat the optional area?
[1:34:22] <RoboXGP> so you can't smoke off of it?
[1:34:37] <+fatal_penguin_> @Binary_Fireball Woolie make Sad go Down
[1:34:40] <+gerahwar> Damn Nero's human ancestor was a boss
[1:34:52] <Rosy_Joan> a Big Boss
[1:34:58] <NeroInfinite> Spinning shurrikens
[1:35:03] <+FreddyLeeSavage> did we talk about Persona 5: The Royal?
[1:35:04] <+BinaryFireball> @fatal_penguin_ indeed, and ninjas dueling samurai make the sad go up
[1:35:06] <+FreddyLeeSavage> I've been in and out
[1:35:09] <+Keith_Chop> why is woolie so quiet
[1:35:28] <RoboXGP> he could use more skill
[1:35:28] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:35:32] <GoldeNOVA> @WoolieVersus Are you planning on doing a Bloody Palace stream?
[1:35:38] <+BinaryFireball> @tygermom he's in the zoneeeeee
[1:35:52] <samuraijakanddaxter> smoke the divine grass
[1:35:55] <%Aussie_Manny> Ahh, so THIS is the replayable variability!
[1:36:00] <RoboXGP> sensei
[1:36:08] <billysan291> So is this game's combat pacing slower than Bloodborne
[1:36:20] <+gerahwar> Where is the skill that can make you do a Rasengan??
[1:36:22] <RoboXGP> dude i'm telling you it's like donky konga
[1:36:28] <%Aussie_Manny> @billysan291 It looks about even, honestly.
[1:36:30] <mechslayer71> @billysan291 LUL like hell
[1:36:31] <That_Mojo> Would you say this game is worth buying now? or do you think waiting for a foreseeable sale
[1:36:47] <mechslayer71> @billysan291 it’s as fast, if not faster
[1:36:56] <RoboXGP> it seems like a pretty hardcore game it could go on sale on p.c.
[1:37:15] <That_Mojo> yeah pc steam sale or something i was thinking
[1:37:22] <RoboXGP> physical copies are something you get in the mail
[1:37:22] <gustavozxd> "as fast" doesn't sound great, I always felt bb was slow tbh
[1:37:25] <billysan291> I couldn't get into Dark Souls because the combat pacing was way too slow but Bloodborne was more of my pace. Especially with the focus moving away from blocking
[1:37:32] <+hoenhime344> no this games combat is the fastest of all the souls games. you NEED to parry. once you learn blocking and dodging is LOOSING the fight the game becomes mutch faster
[1:37:34] <+Keith_Chop> idk if this game has replayablitiy
[1:37:43] <+BinaryFireball> I bought it but returned it, I would rebuy on sale though if they made a few changes
[1:37:46] <mechslayer71> Heads up, upgraded tools are new things you have to equip separately @woolieversus
[1:37:48] <+gerahwar> Rescue the BOI
[1:37:49] <+fatal_penguin_> I want to buy this, but I'm not a fan of these types of Punishing games. But ahh
[1:37:57] <+Keith_Chop> maybe in challenge runs but the lack of customization makes me a little worried for a game like this
[1:38:04] <%Asagi66> Asagi66 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[1:38:05] <+BinaryFireball> I hate parrying though
[1:38:11] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus there's also a merchant nearby the old lady who gave you the bell
[1:38:11] <%Aussie_Manny> Gotta get back, back to the past
[1:38:12] <RoboXGP> it's a rythem game lol
[1:38:13] <%Aussie_Manny> Samurai Wolf.
[1:38:13] <dontfeedthechocobo> he's gonna take you back to the past
[1:38:18] <+天使42199> bloodborne this bloodborne that, I like bloodborne but holy shit is it overrated
[1:38:26] <+Keith_Chop> parrying is my favorite mechanic in this game
[1:38:26] <+天使42199> souls is more my speed then bb
[1:38:29] <+hoenhime344> @tygermom there is ALOT of rpg elements in this game. they just unlock later
[1:38:29] <dontfeedthechocobo> to play the shitty games that suck ass
[1:38:30] <+Keith_Chop> its straight royal guard
[1:38:43] <gustavozxd> people like this thing too much BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[1:38:48] <%GohanEgret> foghorn deadhorn
[1:38:48] <Thalchampz> LUL
[1:38:49] <+fatal_penguin_> We having fried chicken tonight, boys
[1:38:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @gerahwar
[1:38:59] <Heartless_01> guard trick gun sword guard!
[1:39:01] <gustavozxd> why do you like this so much BabyRage
[1:39:07] <+天使42199> @gustavozxd atpRtsd4
[1:39:08] <%Aussie_Manny> Nice Colonel voice, Woolz.
[1:39:08] <+Keith_Chop> im like 3/4 of the way through and i don't think the RPG elements are replay friendly
[1:39:13] <Varanoo> there is a hidden merchant near there
[1:39:18] <mechslayer71> @binary_fireball Well that’s not going away LUL
[1:39:24] <+gerahwar> I said I said these damn Shinbois giving me neck pains!
[1:39:33] <samuraijakanddaxter> did woolie talk to the guy in the bucket who will trade for carp scales in the last stream? cant remember
[1:39:36] <RoboXGP> you can beat it with out upgrading attack, it's just harder
[1:39:37] <SiegeJay> @tygermom WAIT! There is no NG+ with stats?
[1:39:41] <%Aussie_Manny> HERE COMES THE MONEEEYYYY
[1:39:41] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus look high up near the lady for a merchant with a valuable item
[1:39:52] <+Keith_Chop> there probably is but what's the point?
[1:39:59] <+BinaryFireball> It might not but they might make it more forgiving? or any easy mode for scrubs like me
[1:40:02] <+Keith_Chop> there's no weapon builds or anything like that
[1:40:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> :(
[1:40:07] <gustavozxd> I'm almost sold on this game, I would really like to actually play it for a little bit before actually buying it though
[1:40:09] <%Aussie_Manny> He's fiiiiiiiine.
[1:40:12] <+gerahwar> Kill him for loot.
[1:40:14] <%GohanEgret> m-m-m-mother~
[1:40:18] <+Keith_Chop> it would just be fighting the same enemies but with buffed attack and defense
[1:40:21] <mechslayer71> Look for the firecrackers woolie @woolieversus
[1:40:22] <Parapattern> Muuuther

[1:40:36] <dontfeedthechocobo> F
[1:40:39] <NeroInfinite> The thing about Sechiro is,,,that it's not a BB or souls game, it's closer to a tenchu game.

[1:42:08] <ManOfReason> mamoru BibleThump
[1:42:09] <+mrshazboto> refreshed stream and suddenly [King Crimson] skipped me forward
[1:42:10] <RoboXGP> does everyone just feel like they wish they were dead?
[1:42:10] <gustavozxd> as long as this game gets harder in subsequent playthroughs then replayability is strong, considering the combat
[1:42:19] <laguerrilha> Jesus that really makes you want to not die
[1:42:20] <+gerahwar> Mamoru!
[1:42:21] <NeoLeoGeo> Wolfdie
[1:42:30] <samuraijakanddaxter> looks like she's got lumbago
[1:42:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:42:31] <+hoenhime344> @gustavozxd BWAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[1:42:44] <+VariantX7> damn hard to not do a mercy killing
[1:42:54] <billysan291> So can the people that upgrade your gear and such also die?
[1:42:58] <RoboXGP> someone flew a canon right thru their building
[1:42:59] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus there's a vital merchant near those two
[1:43:04] <+fatal_penguin_> Would god understand if you were in rough shape like them and you wanted a mercy kill?
[1:43:08] <TrashLeviathan> ???? @hoenhime344
[1:43:13] <gustavozxd> so everyone playing the game is just reviving without caring about dragonrot at all?
[1:43:15] <RAH001> u can zoom
[1:43:15] <Varanoo> UP
[1:43:19] <+天使42199> @billysan291 dont think so, but im not sure

[1:43:47] <+gerahwar> Is the thief name Patches-Kun??
[1:43:48] <NZolozabal> I had a crazy idea of a Looney Tunes parody of Jurassic Park. Think about it; Bugs Bunny and Lola as Alan Grant and Ellie Satler, Daffy Duck as Ian Malcolm, Foghorn Leghorn as John Hammond, Elmer Fudd as Gennaro, Yosemite Sam as Robert Muldoon. The list goes on!
[1:43:49] <Ristwach> Did he talk to Mob?
[1:43:51] <+天使42199> @gustavozxd you can reduce the effect of d rot

[1:49:35] <gustavozxd> it's funny when the streamer goes "oh so this is like that, nice" and I'm just thinking "no that's wrong oh my God he's gonna die, yep he's dead"
[1:49:50] <+mrshazboto> Drink the money like blood

[1:50:06] <Ristwach> Funny how Woolie is going away
[1:50:10] <RAH001> wrong way
[1:50:15] <RoboXGP> you guys sent him looking for the merchant by the boss arena
[1:50:21] <RoboXGP> now he's trying to climb a cliff
[1:50:26] <+JustToWatch> what area is he in
[1:50:30] <billysan291> From the look of it exploring and sneaking around look like a lot of fun
[1:50:38] <Ristwach> There is a Mob merchant on that cliff tho @aiyobro
[1:50:38] <f4ntom98> !uptime
[1:50:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 50 minutes
[1:50:44] <glorioushedonist> apparently pat has fucked his playthrough lol
[1:50:50] <That_Mojo> you guys suck at directions
[1:50:58] <TrashLeviathan> @glorioushedonist how
[1:51:03] <gustavozxd> oh boy I wanna see that
[1:51:09] <DrunkenFlask> @glorioushedonist whatd he do now?
[1:51:13] <+cabooseteamkill> head towards the sound of crows to find the merchant.
[1:51:14] <giogio346> did tenchu age well?
[1:51:16] <RoboXGP> I have like 3 hours of me just stuck in the same post
[1:51:19] <mechslayer71> @mojokingizakku They really don’t. Woolie plus stream delay is insurmountable
[1:51:22] <glorioushedonist> I think a guy I. chat tricked him into killi g a character
[1:51:22] <+polaroidjackson> did he ring the bell lel
[1:51:27] <gustavozxd> this game does seem to be the kind where you can just completely fuck everything up
[1:51:42] <DrunkenFlask> Welp rip pats game
[1:51:44] <+Thunderhog> LUL
[1:51:48] <%GohanEgret> dude in the back THICC
[1:51:48] <BimboTreant> that sumo on the bg LUL
[1:51:50] <DrStinkers> What was that noise
[1:51:59] <DrStinkers> must have been nothing
[1:51:59] <mechslayer71> @drunkenflask What happen?
[1:52:01] <RoboXGP> he's not going to beat this game any faster by listening to us, that's all im sayin
[1:52:03] <Zayasu> @DrunkenFlask ?
[1:52:06] <Ristwach> Did he mess up side quest wise? @DrunkenFlask
[1:52:14] <MyNameIsRasus> I'M HIDIN FROM THE PUNISHER
[1:52:15] <Tucker0603> @glorioushedonist I thought NPCs were unkillable
[1:52:17] <@akuda_bar> it's not confirmed
[1:52:27] <+NPCMatro> there look bihind the ruined house
[1:52:27] <@akuda_bar> people are saying he can still get the items
[1:52:29] <+thehelminator> Is this royalguard the game?
[1:52:37] <Ristwach> Yes
[1:52:43] <+thehelminator> dope
[1:52:43] <+MisterAngryEyes112> That's a good analogy
[1:52:45] <DrunkenFlask> @glorioushedonist just said some guy in pats stream told him to kill a character and it fucked his game i guess
[1:52:45] <RAH001> wrong way woolie
[1:52:50] <+Thunderhog> The greed is paying off
[1:52:54] <@akuda_bar> your other left
[1:52:56] <+NPCMatro> the other cliff
[1:52:58] <+deidriel> wrong cliff Woolie
[1:53:01] <%Skullgod> hey akuda!
[1:53:08] <@akuda_bar> hello my friend
[1:53:13] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus it's where all the crows are

[1:53:51] <%GohanEgret> crows? vulcan raven?!
[1:53:52] <+Candyman36> go around
[1:53:56] <@akuda_bar> starboard
[1:54:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> wow i did not see this
[1:54:13] <MyNameIsRasus> east? i thought you said weast
[1:54:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i met him way later
[1:54:14] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus there ya go
[1:54:14] <prime_name> Is he clipping?
[1:54:25] <mechagrover> yo woolie
[1:54:32] <mechslayer71> Get the firecrackers, it’s a Shinto I took @woolieversus
[1:54:32] <samuraijakanddaxter> switched over to pat's stream theres a funny tension in the air
[1:54:34] <Ristwach> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli It's how you get firecracker early
[1:54:34] <%GohanEgret> woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN
[1:54:42] <%Aussie_Manny> Polnareff?
[1:54:49] <alexandrecau> creepy but money though
[1:54:55] <+fatal_penguin_> WHaddya Buying?!
[1:54:55] <%yeknomlive> is he selling money?
[1:54:58] <mechslayer71> Get firecrackers, it’s a shinobi tool @woolieversus
[1:55:01] <TrashLeviathan> firecrackers really good
[1:55:02] <NeonBleu> Worse place for a storefront ever
[1:55:06] <RoboXGP> you want his gourd seed
[1:55:07] <Tucker0603> FIREWORKS
[1:55:07] <RoboXGP> later
[1:55:29] <mechslayer71> That was a typo @woolieversus
[1:55:51] <CatmanIX> money that is immune to death
[1:55:51] <%tank7013> @yeknomlive Seems to be FROM's answer to banking money. Pay 10 gold to make sure you don't lose 100 on death
[1:55:56] <Ristwach> It's insurance
[1:55:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> buy money to lose money LUL
[1:55:59] <+Spr0cket> same as souls
[1:56:00] <Rellim80> Yup
[1:56:01] <laguerrilha> So you dont lose at death
[1:56:03] <shevan123> is roberts dad dead
[1:56:06] <Ristwach> Buy money to not lose it
[1:56:08] <%yeknomlive> ooohhhh ok. that's actually kinda neat
[1:56:09] <umm_idunno> you dont lose coin purses when you die
[1:56:10] <mechslayer71> You don’t lose them when you die
[1:56:10] <+korth367> dont lose pouches when u die
[1:56:12] <Dr_Mooose> it's like free money...kinda
[1:56:13] <+A_Casual_Scrub> its like a bank
[1:56:13] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus you don't lose the coin purses on death
[1:56:14] <samuraijakanddaxter> wee robert
[1:56:14] <OldManJEWc> the coin purse acts as a bank
[1:56:14] <marlborored5> @woolieversus because of you die you loose it
[1:56:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yeah you lose 10
[1:56:23] <laguerrilha> You lose 10
[1:56:23] <Edtango> 10
[1:56:23] <%tank7013> 10 coin loss
[1:56:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 100 per small
[1:56:25] <NeonBleu> 10
[1:56:26] <Dawnchaser_Twitch> He talks like that because he's a Foreigner @WoolieVersus
[1:56:27] <Ristwach> 10 coin loss
[1:56:28] <laguerrilha> 10 per
[1:56:30] <PE4X> 10 bucks insurance
[1:56:31] <RoboXGP> when you die you lose half you can't get it back
[1:56:33] <+sumire_gelato> yep 10%
[1:56:33] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:56:34] <RoboXGP> buy 2 of em
[1:56:36] <7c_nickel> gotta pay for the puch
[1:56:36] <+A_Casual_Scrub> 10%
[1:56:36] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus you're basically getting insurance, loose money now so you don't when you die
[1:56:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you lose 10
[1:56:42] <Ristwach> But you don't lose it at death
[1:56:45] <mechslayer71> You lose ten for each 100
[1:56:49] <buerdo> 100
[1:56:55] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> 10% extra
[1:56:56] <NeroInfinite> Yep
[1:56:58] <laguerrilha> its a good deal
[1:56:59] <RoboXGP> save up five for a gourd seed
[1:57:01] <%Skullgod> kill 1 life to save 1 hundred
[1:57:14] <%tank7013> You're basically paying for the puch it comes in
[1:57:15] <+Candyman36> 10 coins is not 10% of 110 people
[1:57:19] <+mrshazboto> That's not a terrible deal
[1:57:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> there are
[1:57:39] <Edtango> It's 10% of the coins you get from the bag dude @Candyman36
[1:57:42] <%tank7013> Well I know the other guy sells something for like 3k
[1:57:42] <%frankthetank285> if u have a lot of money and don't have anything to spend on it it's better to buy them so u don't lose the money and later u can buy bigger purses
[1:57:50] <TrashLeviathan> @Candyman36 its about 9%
[1:58:00] <BusterRepukken> From Softwares obsession with crows
[1:58:06] <BusterRepukken> pickle pee
[1:58:09] <+fatal_penguin_> Sell him some of your Seed, woolie
[1:58:12] <caja_de_ojos> is he the crow of the game?
[1:58:13] <+mrshazboto> Agree with @frankthetank285, better buy them now if you're not buying anything else
[1:58:15] <%masterfire23> when does he get the shinobi glock?
[1:58:18] <RoboXGP> he's like a bank
[1:58:39] <samuraijakanddaxter> wheres the rocket launcher merchant?
[1:58:41] <Parapattern> The shinobi BFG
[1:58:46] <Rellim80> In English this guy has Wesker as the VO
[1:58:54] <TrashLeviathan> the shinobi ak47
[1:59:19] <BusterRepukken> WHEEZE
[1:59:23] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @giogio346
[1:59:29] <RoboXGP> all unseen aid does is make you not lose exp and money
[1:59:36] <Parapattern> Shinobi Cerebral Bore
[1:59:36] <+天使42199> whered woolie find the fire cracker
[1:59:40] <DrunkenFlask> @rellim80 really dc douglas? Thats cool
[1:59:42] <+天使42199> I missed that in my game
[1:59:42] <DrStinkers> would that have worked on horse boss?
[1:59:44] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:47] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> talk to the lady
[2:00:07] <NeroInfinite> she got the cure.
[2:00:10] <TrashLeviathan> @caol2017 its really effective

[2:01:19] <%linkwolf4> "if you weren't so SHIT you wouldn't be killing your FRIENDS"
[2:01:23] <%Skullgod> its pats heaven
[2:01:24] <mechslayer71> @fantasiamenma Hasn’t even encountered Juzou
[2:01:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> without their consent too
[2:01:24] <SiegeJay> Resurrection steals life from people!!!!
[2:01:25] <Dr_Mooose> they knew the risk
[2:01:30] <Ristwach> Sekiro is Moro
[2:01:30] <mccf> SUPER DRAGON AIDS
[2:01:32] <RoboXGP> Have you ever smoked DMT?
[2:01:38] <NeonBleu> Spirit Bomb is literally your spirit
[2:01:39] <%tank7013> Well you're only stealing the life of your friends if you fuck up so often that yours runs out
[2:01:40] <+mrshazboto> Sounds like a cool magic system
[2:01:41] <DrStinkers> So the buu spirit bomb
[2:01:42] <Varanoo> Get good woolie and your friends will stop dying
[2:01:47] <SiegeJay> @WoolieVersus Just Resurrection or dying in general?
[2:01:52] <%Explodincatz> Explodincatz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[2:01:59] <NZolozabal> I'd like to see a no death run on this game.
[2:02:01] <+VariantX7> this feels like the type of shit dishonored was on causing plagues and shit
[2:02:02] <+korth367> dying in general i think
[2:02:05] <RoboXGP> it's super aids
[2:02:44] <Ristwach> Both death and resurrection
[2:02:47] <%Lion_kun> i'd say save it for the end
[2:02:49] <+KR_Black> Fuck unseen aid
[2:02:50] <+mrshazboto> So it's a hollowing system
[2:02:56] <@akuda_bar> it's meeeeee
[2:03:02] <Ristwach> I thought I wouldn't get Dragonrot if I just chose death
[2:03:04] <%Lion_kun> reset npcs
[2:03:07] <%Aussie_Manny> Man, Fromsoft LOVES to hollow you out.
[2:03:08] <+KR_Black> @Lion_kun You are assuming NPC's cant die right ?
[2:03:10] <Ristwach> I still got Dragonrot
[2:03:12] <mechslayer71> Use at idol DO NOT USE ON ITS OWN
[2:03:21] <Mike_Mc> So is there any benefit for Dragonrot? it seems like its super soft
[2:03:22] <RoboXGP> lol whut?
[2:03:27] <%Lion_kun> don't waste it now though
[2:03:31] <+天使42199> longer and longer Kreygasm
[2:03:32] <%Lion_kun> wait till they get mostly dead
[2:03:46] <laguerrilha> how do you get more?
[2:03:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:03:47] <RoboXGP> you don't want to lose npc's but you can wait until the 2nd part of ashina
[2:03:49] <%TheOneUpWarrior> dragonrot halts npc quests
[2:03:53] <%Lion_kun> i'm sure woolie is gonna die much more
[2:03:58] <Ristwach> How do you even know when they're mostly dead?
[2:04:07] <+天使42199> Yeah how do you know ?
[2:04:11] <mccf> When they wheeze harder
[2:04:13] <RoboXGP> everyone starts coffing, you lose exp and money
[2:04:16] <mechslayer71> @lion_kun You can’t progress quests while people are sick
[2:04:25] <Mike_Mc> will the npcs actually die? like if you lose Emma are you totally f'd?
[2:04:29] <BusterRepukken> Back to the games that suck ass
[2:04:30] <samuraijakanddaxter> if i was playing this game i'd avoid the dragonrot mechanic by simply never dying
[2:04:49] <$Louie_Salmon> Not dying is a pretty good strategy
[2:04:54] <%tank7013> So is it hard deaths that trigger the rot? Because I've resurrected a LOT of times since curing it initially and haven't seen a hint of it coming back
[2:05:06] <RoboXGP> it's unrelated to the story, jus keep them alive and make sure you talk to as many as you can
[2:05:12] <BusterRepukken> Hard deaths I think
[2:05:19] <samuraijakanddaxter> all the way to the easy here is the guy in the bucket i dno if woolie talked to him already
[2:05:20] <+dukenux> Fish?
[2:05:23] <samuraijakanddaxter> east
[2:05:27] <samuraijakanddaxter> and more fish
[2:05:31] <+dukenux> fish stay dead probly
[2:05:39] <Mike_Mc> did you find blue pot man?
[2:05:40] <Ristwach> Fish do stay dead
[2:05:50] <+dukenux> Bork busted

[2:06:00] <crimsonharvest> Whats up nerds
[2:06:13] <samuraijakanddaxter> from the way woolie came in, that east
[2:06:14] <+Candyman36> fish die when they are killed
[2:06:18] <+dukenux> Scrubitis
[2:06:19] <mccf> what
[2:06:33] <RAH001> tree got in the way
[2:06:34] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> not my game atpHarada

[2:07:40] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Wha'ts wrong WITH YOUR ARM DUDE
[2:07:41] <BasilBear> Kappa
[2:07:42] <NeonBleu> Kappa ?
[2:07:42] <TrashLeviathan> bloodborne hand

[2:07:44] <+GrimSquirrel> Kappa
[2:07:44] <Parapattern> He got those Salad Finger hands
[2:07:45] <+天使42199> Kappa
[2:07:45] <RoboXGP> not really maybe a hermit
[2:07:51] <Kiraklene> Kappa
[2:07:53] <laguerrilha> Oh in english its a creepy woman like voice
[2:07:56] <DonatelloJose> Kappa
[2:07:58] <Ristwach> @masterfire23 It was simpler time back then
[2:08:07] <Ristwach> was a simpler time
[2:08:19] <+sumire_gelato> Divine Blessing *tm
[2:08:20] <+Qsmash_> divine grass, huh? majinoSkiip
[2:08:32] <+天使42199> grass atpSuspect
[2:08:36] <RoboXGP> i just use pellets
[2:08:48] <Mike_Mc> @Qsmash_ SHHKKKEEEEEP!
[2:08:50] <%linkwolf4> lytWORRY dude reminds me of the toilet hand from majora's mask
[2:08:54] <worldbrand> I've faced exactly one fire minboss and preferred to just deflect
[2:08:58] <TrashLeviathan> look at that key item
[2:08:59] <+kraajkase> it's refillable
[2:09:00] <DonatelloJose> @qsmash_ used to make left handed cigarettes woolieMIRIN
[2:09:10] <worldbrand> That one's cool
[2:09:21] <samuraijakanddaxter> theres still at least one more fish here, maybe two, and if you fail to get them they seem to be on a timer and come back
[2:09:23] <%Aussie_Manny> Its forigin.
[2:09:51] <$ofloofy> Youre not allowed
[2:09:56] <worldbrand> They're basically impossible to kill if startled
[2:09:56] <$ofloofy> to get taht fish
[2:10:02] <samuraijakanddaxter> you need to projectile it
[2:10:04] <%Aussie_Manny> uh....
[2:10:08] <%Aussie_Manny> 2deep4me
[2:10:08] <Dragon_Batman> Looks a little too deep
[2:10:09] <+JustToWatch> those aren't treasure fish, they're attack fish
[2:10:18] <umm_idunno> i think its easier if you lock off and aim the manera down
[2:10:19] <RoboXGP> use firecracker
[2:10:23] <+BinaryFireball> @woolieversus yea totally just listen to the creepy hand in the jar ...
[2:10:24] <%Aussie_Manny> THAT MAKES NO SENSE
[2:10:25] <umm_idunno> camera
[2:10:28] <worldbrand> those are all treasure carp IIRC
[2:10:41] <DrStinkers> This guy is a ridiculously fast swimmer
[2:10:47] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> you can, but you need to get lucky hit in
[2:10:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:10:54] <Zayasu> shuriken wont help
[2:10:55] <RoboXGP> to blow it up
[2:10:59] <worldbrand> They do respawn until killed
[2:11:01] <RoboXGP> grapple?
[2:11:03] <LTKonnor> He has shinobi swimming powers
[2:11:08] <samuraijakanddaxter> throw dynamite
[2:11:16] <LTKonnor> !uptime
[2:11:17] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 11 minutes
[2:11:18] <RoboXGP> It's coming right for us!
[2:11:23] <+korth367> use your fishing rod idk lol
[2:11:29] <RoboXGP> then forget it maybe
[2:11:29] <Mike_Mc> shurikens do not work on fish from my experience
[2:11:35] <samuraijakanddaxter> it will come back eventually
[2:11:36] <%serranobros> you swim at it really fast and slash it
[2:11:47] <+BinaryFireball> are there even enough fish?
[2:11:48] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Water is apparently shuriken proof
[2:12:01] <RoboXGP> No
[2:12:10] <%Skullgod> just swim faster
[2:12:11] <+MisterAngryEyes112> wait, did Sekiro account for water refraction? He might have actually missed LUL
[2:12:12] <RoboXGP> it would be fun to try
[2:12:13] <worldbrand> There are more later in the game
[2:12:14] <RoboXGP> maybe later
[2:12:16] <$ofloofy> Scare it to death Kappa
[2:12:18] <marlborored5> this is for later
[2:12:21] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> gun fish it
[2:12:30] <RoboXGP> gotta down air it

[2:12:46] <DrStinkers> Figures the jar guy has a goldfish's memory span
[2:12:48] <Mike_Mc> all shurikens are made of hardened sugar, and you call yourself a weeb
[2:12:59] <worldbrand> There are others that are way easier to kill than that one, that one's just deep for some reason
[2:13:09] <Zayasu> how did the first one die so easily though
[2:13:20] <$ofloofy> Deep fish are too strong for now
[2:13:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> deep fish pizza
[2:13:31] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> it might be bugged
[2:13:40] <%tank7013> That might not even be a treasure carp. I know there's a few generic fish in this stage
[2:13:42] <DaniReDux> SabaPing
[2:13:44] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> try respawning it
[2:13:59] <RoboXGP> it could be two treasure carp, but its' white who knows

[2:25:46] <+TomServal> Is Woolie going to meet Gram-gram?
[2:25:52] <laguerrilha> hum, could had Wolf talking with a tremble or wimping a little. No emotion its kind of bland
[2:25:52] <Parapattern> It's Boruto's Dad!
[2:25:54] <%RayDaug> people are going in expecting a soulds game, and getting something much mroe actioney
[2:26:09] <TrashLeviathan> this music tho
[2:26:16] <StrykerDragoon> that's the Bushido way @laguerrilha
[2:26:22] <+GrimSquirrel> @Parapattern I feel 10 years older everytime i hear that
[2:26:26] <Mike_Mc> you could also wall shimmy shimmy shimmy till the break of dawn
[2:26:30] <alexandrecau> Shinobi don't show emotions even when their family die
[2:26:40] <alexandrecau> That's something tenchu always did
[2:27:02] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Shinobi = Japanese Hitmen
[2:27:14] <BimboTreant> that dude is gonna run away
[2:27:23] <alexandrecau> Like in tenchu z your character has the same face but your boss mentions you kept your lover's ear as memento and attack in revenge

[2:28:12] <+Kanax55> It must be twitch
[2:28:23] <That_Mojo> so this is what actions were removed from time but still played out
[2:28:32] <billysan291> Twitch Connection Dies Twice
[2:28:35] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Pat's stream didn't have it so it must be random on twitches end
[2:28:35] <buerdo> The bamboo getting cut is so nice
[2:28:52] <+blacktomcruise2> Stealth kills look like (sex)
[2:28:57] <Thalchampz> MARIO 64

[2:29:55] <%FeelinNifty> king crimson the world deletes everything except the frozen time
[2:30:02] <%Skullgod> the speear
[2:30:02] <SiegeJay> @stormingryocan220 Proposal: The World: Hanged Man
[2:30:08] <samuraijakanddaxter> you gotta get up in that ass
[2:30:11] <laguerrilha> That violin part sounds like the AVP terror sounds
[2:30:27] <freddystonejr> spear bro is to gud
[2:30:29] <StrykerDragoon> gotta hit in the back from watching
[2:30:30] <SiegeJay> Stop Time and can attack with infinite range
[2:30:33] <buerdo> Mikiri is so hard
[2:30:42] <+Verd_254> The dodge parry has a pretty big window if you dodge into the attack on those thrusts
[2:30:49] <+blacktomcruise2> Watching pat and woolie at the same time
[2:30:55] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> OH NOOOO, OHHHH MY GUUUOOOD!!!
[2:30:55] <%masterfire23> Proposal: Hanged Man in the Mirror
[2:31:01] <buerdo> Swim up river
[2:31:01] <topographiary> had to come here to have fun watching woolie die because I got sick of dying myself in this game...
[2:31:11] <jotabranded> just run
[2:31:18] <SiegeJay> What makes King Krimson powerful is his second ability to see 10 seconds
[2:31:27] <TrashLeviathan> just run
[2:31:37] <TrashLeviathan> big cowardice
[2:31:54] <SiegeJay> King Crimson would just fast forward to getting hit by a punch without Epitath
[2:31:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:32:05] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Proposal Proposal: [The Hand: Requiem] on actual smart user

[2:32:15] <flawlessded> I don't think you can get back through that gate, go to the river
[2:32:22] <LordGroomp> did woolie get the key?
[2:32:28] <%Solidnick18> big nibba
[2:32:37] <%Solidnick18> ooo
[2:32:45] <DaniReDux> @TomServal Aqua Clash
[2:33:06] <jotabranded> King Crimson is strong as shit, one punch can easily chop off a arm
[2:33:07] <BusterRepukken> shooters in this game are the bane of my existence
[2:33:09] <Parapattern> That shield guy: "What's going on, guys?"
[2:33:22] <+Milpool> Milpool subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[2:33:22] <samuraijakanddaxter> man had a shield and wasnt even using it
[2:33:46] <SiegeJay> Proposal [Silver Chariot Requim: Death 13]
[2:34:00] <+TomServal> Killer Queen had tons of abilities but it couldn't fight for shit.
[2:34:02] <SiegeJay> Put people to sleep and attack them in dream
[2:34:02] <flawlessded> Woolie jump up the walls before going back to the monk dude.
[2:34:11] <LordGroomp> there’s a secret in the river :)
[2:34:29] <%masterfire23> Kira did nothing wrong
[2:34:31] <+dukenux> Bakaaa
[2:34:51] <StrykerDragoon> Kira still my favorite villain
[2:35:02] <SiegeJay> Kira did nothing wrong but killing a girl related to a Mangaka
[2:35:18] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Killer Queen was mostly like a "stealth" stand. Considering how weak he is close range
[2:35:30] <+dukenux> Kira just wanted a quiet life, and that's why he kept exploding people
[2:35:31] <+MisterAngryEyes112> nothing wrong with a little BRUTAL DISMEMBERMENT and MURDER
[2:35:44] <flawlessded> JUMP UP THE WALLS FIRST
[2:35:51] <+fatal_penguin_> It's Poop
[2:35:51] <Parapattern> I can barely tell where those ax guys are swinging
[2:35:53] <+dukenux> Killer Queen is the
[2:35:55] <%tank7013> Well... technically 2 secrets
[2:36:00] <kappamutton> sup gang
[2:36:02] <+TomServal> Highway Star and Pearl Jam. Make fortune instantly.
[2:36:04] <+dukenux> Killer Queen is the Ted Kaczynski of Stands
[2:36:25] <RoboXGP> INuyasha
[2:36:35] <SiegeJay> @TomServal What's Pearl Jams ability?
[2:36:41] <samuraijakanddaxter> yaint seen wall jumping like that in your dark souls games
[2:36:47] <LordGroomp> remember you can cut bamboo
[2:36:59] <+dukenux> Hey Ya is the most useful stand
[2:36:59] <ManfredA> Killer Queen itself is suited to most combat roles, but Kira's personality makes it a stealth stand
[2:37:08] <+Verd_254> top skill is a good one on the ninja arts, gives live back for doing deathblows
[2:37:10] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> wished they gived Jonathan Joestar his stand during the JoJo heaven game
[2:37:11] <+TomServal> It heals your body of it's negative issues.
[2:37:15] <+Verd_254> life*
[2:37:19] <+Kanax55> Healing on deathblow if very good
[2:37:27] <RoboXGP> try the top ones on the first page
[2:37:28] <BusterRepukken> is this anal rodeo
[2:37:29] <caja_de_ojos> @SiegeJay makes the effects of food extreme
[2:37:30] <TrashLeviathan> i recommend the more paper dolls
[2:37:38] <Mike_Mc> hydration is very important
[2:37:41] <TrashLeviathan> especially for the next part
[2:37:42] <kappamutton> what would a jonathan joestar stand be? something like purple haze
[2:37:44] <+Das_Prints> The paper dolls will lead you to getting ahead on every deathblow
[2:37:59] <+Das_Prints> A heal*
[2:38:11] <SiegeJay> How does making food heal and tracking people make money?
[2:38:20] <%serranobros> more papers leads to health on deathblow woolie
[2:38:21] <ManfredA> a hermit purple type stand, but he would probably use it far differently than Joseph
[2:38:21] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus did you visit the 3 story pagoda hidden in the bamboo area?
[2:38:22] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> I was thinking more like The World but whit a twist. since Dio is using his body
[2:38:22] <+TomServal> So you make people super hungry with highway star and then they eat pearl jam's food. They're so rejuvenated that you can charge them assloads.
[2:38:31] <LordGroomp> the river secret is nearby the bamboo idol and requires a sharp blade
[2:38:33] <+korth367> it's not that amazing
[2:38:35] <LordGroomp> thats all ill say
[2:38:42] <+korth367> it's a forward jump
[2:38:47] <+TomServal> It's nothing but profit.
[2:39:04] <samuraijakanddaxter> if i was playing this game i'd simply acquire all the skills
[2:39:04] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:39:04] <jotabranded> it's good for now
[2:39:09] <DeebzNutz100> good for sweeps?
[2:39:15] <buerdo> Any one know what a heavy coin purse is worth?
[2:39:21] <+Terry_Oso> feels good, sounds good 😂
[2:39:29] <LordGroomp> @buerdo 500 sen
[2:39:30] <DrStinkers> MY LEG
[2:39:39] <buerdo> @lordgroomp ty
[2:39:48] <PleaseStopRyan> Holy shit Woolie looks FOCUSED
[2:39:51] <@akuda_bar> he should do that aaah t-t-t-t-t thing that link does
[2:40:10] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Woolie has become MOTIVATED
[2:40:13] <DaniReDux> It is possible to beat shield guys without the axe?
[2:40:30] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> stealth kills
[2:40:32] <+Scrivener_exe> They can be baited into a charge where they get tired for a sec but axe is best
[2:40:34] <%tank7013> @DANIdespalomao Yea but it's a pain
[2:40:36] <LordGroomp> @danidespalomao yes but it requires big strafes
[2:40:49] <SiegeJay> @WoolieVersus You came to the wrong cave mutherfucker
[2:41:15] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Bomb would be amazing in these passages

[2:42:56] <7c_nickel> Cant you just side dodge?
[2:43:06] <%Lion_kun> i would just stealth them
[2:43:08] <Ristwach> Does he not have the counter?
[2:43:12] <flawlessded> You need to miriki counter them. You need to master that ability if you're gonna get anywhere in this game
[2:43:13] <Varanoo> You can't take one why would you think you can take 2?
[2:43:19] <LordGroomp> does woolie have the spear stomp?
[2:43:22] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Swipes can only be jumped kicked
[2:43:26] <+天使42199> @7c_nickel you can but the tracking on there Danger attacks is absolutely fucking nuts
[2:43:30] <Mike_Mc> it looks like the same fall damage everytime
[2:43:38] <DashXero> It doesn't help that their moves are hard to read.
[2:44:28] <TrashLeviathan> you gotta master the miriki counter @WoolieVersus
[2:44:43] <cavefishes> which bosses have woolie beaten so far?
[2:45:08] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Miriki counter is like dmc 3 Royal block levels of insane
[2:45:08] <Zayasu> horse guy
[2:45:16] <Varanoo> > Dodge forwards <

[2:46:38] <DashXero> They're Shinobi hunters. They know what's up.
[2:46:45] <@akuda_bar> you have to learn to fear death to win against spear dudes
[2:46:54] <OozieStream> HOLY SHIT

[2:51:19] <Mike_Mc> do you feel like this is more of a fighting game than other fromsoft games?
[2:51:28] <+TheBimbollo> I love how this game punishes all the bad habits people developed from Souls games
[2:51:29] <+Verd_254> no stamina is big, breaking in and out of combat is a huge tactic, particularly to pick of stragglers or archers.

[2:52:47] <d_wagon> Oscarbait
[2:52:54] <BusterRepukken> Ive replayed DMC5 3 times already.
[2:53:05] <generalve> massively story based while Japanese stuff is gameplay heavy
[2:53:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:53:09] <DashXero> There's a connection to Dante and Nero and V, too, though.
[2:53:15] <Mike_Mc> the fact that dmc5 is still mission based is a good feeling through back to an older era of games
[2:53:16] <Dragon_Batman> Western stuff is better at doing kool stuff at you than you doing kool stuff at it?
[2:53:16] <gustavozxd> I've replayed dmc5 don't even know how much and I'm playing it rn
[2:53:20] <+天使42199> My problem is Triple A western games are getting a bit too cinematic. Too much walking n talking segments and long drawn out dialogue segments that are BORING to replay
[2:53:34] <+天使42199> focusing too much on being movie like instead of being a good game
[2:53:36] <@akuda_bar> but japan is scary
[2:53:36] <joylent_blue> i'm playing dmc5 RIGHT now, finished DMD the other day

[2:54:24] <joylent_blue> if you're looking to dig your teeth into something then DMC is the fucking best
[2:54:28] <gustavozxd> sadly people don't know the regular jump is an OP ass Dodge LUL
[2:54:31] <@akuda_bar> you're a hipster woolie just accept it
[2:54:38] <MayorRev> I hope DMC5 wins an award
[2:54:42] <joylent_blue> but a lot of people just want a shallow kiddy pool to flop around in a little while
[2:54:44] <BusterRepukken> Anthem was the best seller for Feburary and it doesn deserve such a distinction
[2:54:45] <%RayDaug> @WoolieVersus The Games press is only just now starting to figure out that the true enemy in DMC is the style meter.

[2:55:05] <%DeRedBaron> @WoolieVersus even back in like teh early 00s games were trying to be like a hollywood movie, but still trying to do that today but it feels like those ideals were less weird cus they were doing this wanting to be taken seriously like how movies wanted to a while back, but it seems like today it holds everything back
[2:55:07] <generalve> IT EXISTS WOOLIE that all it matters
[2:55:13] <BusterRepukken> I can see DMC5 winning Best Action Game this year
[2:55:32] <joylent_blue> if DMC5 doesn't win best action game thats a fucking crime

[3:13:14] <@Menitta> I'm here okay lets go
[3:13:19] <Ristwach> RIP NPC dude
[3:13:24] <LordGroomp> fire truly is the deadliest sword
[3:13:30] <%Skullgod> hey man npc man might live now
[3:13:46] <Ristwach> I did the same
[3:13:48] <LordGroomp> oh he remembered me :)
[3:13:57] <CantiNandaba> i didn't even know you can go back there
[3:14:03] <Dragon_Batman> This is quite pretty
[3:14:07] <Ristwach> I only spoke to the NPC after the clean up
[3:14:18] <gustavozxd> he's gonna forget that path

[3:14:25] <+deidriel> go inside the house
[3:14:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> masterful tactic LUL
[3:14:41] <Ristwach> LUL
[3:15:20] <LordGroomp> i baited jozu then hid under the house to get the backstab
[3:15:26] <+Bigmeanjean> understandable, hall wug
[3:15:31] <CantiNandaba> has he fought the horse guy yet?
[3:15:32] <LordGroomp> npc man was an excellent tank
[3:15:50] <Ristwach> He first tried it @augmentedman
[3:15:50] <%jinking79> i fail to understand why jump kick is double tap jump button
[3:15:55] <Dragon_Batman> It's a fair way to play
[3:16:05] <%CrazySMT417> best way to play imo
[3:16:07] <Djinnazz> Yeah that's really not an issue in this one.
[3:16:17] <gustavozxd> you're playing the way you should with these games it's fine
[3:16:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> pretty sure thats inside the house
[3:16:19] <%tank7013> This area is so useless that I have a hard time believing it's actually useless
[3:16:29] <LordGroomp> nothing wrong with playing this way in a game where you die in four hits
[3:16:30] <Sedrelic> we know..there are compilations
[3:16:30] <+Verd_254> item clipping through the wall
[3:16:34] <Mike_Mc> this seems like a box full of nothing
[3:16:35] <vVAstrAVv> im glad youre doing this woolie i hadnt found that path and it might let me stealth some of those guys before the big fight

[3:17:53] <+sumire_gelato> @WoolieVersus don't worry about pace, people like how you take everything in. pat is way farther but the commentary suffers
[3:17:58] <alexandrecau> mr shakedown with a sword
[3:18:13] <Ristwach> @stormingryocan220 He didn't notice him
[3:18:18] <CantiNandaba> if he's a drunkard then why is his canteen filled with poison
[3:18:19] <LordGroomp> woolie found the aggro range
[3:18:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because booze is poison
[3:18:30] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Rip
[3:18:32] <Ristwach> Even tho he looked right at him LUL @stormingryocan220
[3:18:32] <CantiNandaba> deep
[3:18:34] <%crudleydrawn> gassy guy
[3:18:40] <xeros720> i like to think his breath is just that bad
[3:18:45] <alexandrecau> @augmentedman alcohol is the sweetest poison
[3:18:52] <CantiNandaba> after a night of drinking my breath is pretty rank too
[3:19:10] <the1manmoshpit> go back and hug the wall for secrets
[3:19:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> OOF
[3:19:33] <%TheOneUpWarrior> i love how juzou fights with a sumo style like you get this whole implied back story
[3:19:51] <LordGroomp> something something run away live to fight another day
[3:20:04] <%crudleydrawn> i love that enemies stop when you do a final kill, like they step back and just go damn
[3:20:05] <RoboXGP> giant curved sword
[3:20:13] <+owl_jack> looking good woolie
[3:20:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Covering his sword with booze poison LUL
[3:20:16] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Big boi woolie fighting big boy alone? dmn
[3:20:29] <DeebzNutz100> At least he was nice enough to wait for you to kill his friend
[3:20:34] <LordGroomp> @animaniacs1126 Even Juzou is afraid!
[3:20:37] <NeroInfinite> Mortis
[3:20:38] <%Skullgod> WOOLIE STOP KILLING YOUR FRIENDS
[3:20:40] <TrashLeviathan> why he so big tho
[3:20:41] <Dragon_Batman> Getting there, do it Woolz!
[3:20:41] <%Skullgod> MY COUGH IS GETTING WORSE
[3:20:42] <+Kaito_Cam> Are are you liking royal guard the game?
[3:20:54] <xeros720> way better than my first try
[3:20:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He aint done yet boi
[3:21:09] <Sedrelic> it reminds me of that stink man from dragon ball
[3:21:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> good first try
[3:21:21] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:21:24] <NeonBleu> *Cough Cough*
[3:21:26] <+Kaito_Cam> Ooof
[3:21:30] <Varanoo> Good try
[3:21:31] <CantiNandaba> does he want advice?
[3:21:34] <JanusII> RIP peasants.
[3:21:37] <+hoenhime344> its e honda with a sword
[3:21:37] <Ristwach> LUL
[3:21:40] <DashXero> Do you think they tried a build with Bloodborne's regain system?
[3:21:48] <LordGroomp> did much better than my first time
[3:21:52] <+Kaito_Cam> So far this is the only mini boss I haven't found a way to sneak attack.
[3:21:53] <RoboXGP> that's money
[3:22:09] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> theres a skill that lets you regain health per kill
[3:22:10] <PleaseStopRyan> Drunkard? You can sneak him, it's fucking HARD though
[3:22:19] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @Kaito_Cam He doesn't count as a mini boss
[3:22:22] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus ya missed an NPC guy who will help ya out, though he does Leroy it
[3:22:28] <LordGroomp> @kaito_cam kill all his guys first, then hide under the house on the left, you can sneak him while he walks back
[3:22:29] <+deidriel> Woolie there is a helper in the river that fights Sumo guy with you
[3:22:38] <Byronic_dreamer> Greetings Woolie and friends
[3:22:40] <+Kaito_Cam> Oh true true @LordGroomp
[3:22:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he helps
[3:22:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes in the bushes
[3:22:52] <+Verd_254> edge of the water
[3:22:54] <+Das_Prints> @dashxero there’s a somewhat similar ability you can get that just heals you a bit whenever you land those deathblow on enemies. It’d be interesting to see regain in this.
[3:22:56] <%tank7013> He just kind of standing there by the water
[3:22:57] <+deidriel> in the pond
[3:23:04] <LordGroomp> the stealth upgrade was surprisingly useful imo
[3:23:04] <Ristwach> @Tucker0603 You can clear the mobs and then talk to him just for Juzo
[3:23:04] <%masterfire23> @woolieversus the unblockable sweep can be jumped over then you use the stomp
[3:23:06] <Byronic_dreamer> You on the drunkard? That guy kicked my ass for a while. Tough SOB.
[3:23:07] <Fyrijou> Hey guys
[3:23:10] <+Kaito_Cam> @That_Marcus_Dude if he gives a bead he's a mini boss, if gives you the shinobi execution it's a boss
[3:23:20] <Ristwach> @Tucker0603 He lived for me that way
[3:23:22] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> He can die thou
[3:23:27] <+Verd_254> you the mini-boss near him and he'll auto-agro so he doesn't die during the fight with the adds
[3:23:34] <+Kaito_Cam> @stormingryocan220 but he comes back if you die.
[3:23:34] <+Verd_254> you can bring*
[3:23:39] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> best leave him after all grunts r dead
[3:23:39] <DashXero> @Das_Prints I heard about that ability. And I agree wholeheartedly.
[3:23:41] <the1manmoshpit> to the right of the grapple rock
[3:23:50] <LordGroomp> man theres so much i cant wait to watch woolie see
[3:23:53] <Fyrijou> @woolieversus are ya hyped for MK11? Was your main already revealed?
[3:23:55] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus I'd kill the little guys first before you talk to him cause he goes in hard once you talk to him
[3:23:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> i saw the npc on pat's stream he actually looked really useful in this fight
[3:24:12] <LordGroomp> near starboard side of the river is the npc
[3:24:25] <%serranobros> woolie if you clear the ads and lose agro you can get a free sneak hit on the boss, and you can talk to the npc AFTER killing the ads and he'll help with the boss
[3:24:28] <+Das_Prints> @woolieversus If you wait to recruit that guy until Juzou is on his last health bar he can help close it out. Otherwise he will usually die if Juzou has two health bars or there are any other enemies left.
[3:24:28] <%TheOneUpWarrior> is that just EX STREAK from dmc5?
[3:24:31] <Dragon_Batman> You got him
[3:24:34] <+Verd_254> he's a huge help if you can make it a 2v1, if you talk to him with the trash still up he basically just kills himself.
[3:24:36] <+LilMKatsu> Always better to avoid hard progress than to overlook things bagelzSip
[3:24:43] <vVAstrAVv> did woolie get the feather prosthetic?
[3:24:59] <BusterRepukken> brain fluud
[3:25:21] <Tucker0603> !uptime
[3:25:21] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 25 minutes
[3:25:24] <%linkwolf4> holy shit is pat still going? goddamn
[3:25:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> take your time
[3:25:31] <LordGroomp> @vvastravv no, i said there was a secret in the river but he got distracted by the fire town, which is fair enough
[3:25:46] <MayorRev> special kind of TWISTED
[3:25:50] <LordGroomp> did anyone find any use for the mist raven tool?
[3:26:05] <xeros720> anything big really
[3:26:13] <DashXero> @LordGroomp You need to watch Max's stream from last night.
[3:26:15] <NZolozabal> So I had a crazy idea. Work with me on this; The Pillar Men for MK11. How does that sound?
[3:26:22] <DashXero> It's spoiler-tastic, though.
[3:26:23] <xeros720> there was one boss i just fought where it was really helpful, spoilers as you might imagine
[3:26:27] <xeros720> but y'know, anything BIG
[3:26:56] <LordGroomp> @dashxero is max at FH pal? (tried to make that spoiler friendly as possible)
[3:27:23] <LordGroomp> @xeros720 does it activate on grabs?
[3:27:35] <DashXero> @LordGroomp I don't even know what that is, so I'll assume not.
[3:27:43] <Tiewolf> when Pat has double the views
[3:28:09] <xeros720> @LordGroomp that's worth testing, i know it works on sweeps and thrusts
[3:28:09] <%queenquagenary> Do you think Woolie knows?
[3:28:15] <Tiewolf> Naw
[3:28:20] <%queenquagenary> Thanks
[3:28:27] <Byronic_dreamer> Pats an asshole tho
[3:28:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:28:32] <xeros720> mostly i just needed room to breath since the boss was hammering me and the mist is great for that
[3:28:40] <Byronic_dreamer> So he gets more views lol
[3:28:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ive been making slow progress
[3:28:49] <Tiewolf> !MOTIVATED
[3:28:49] <@Moobot> 280 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:28:50] <DashXero> @LordGroomp But he made really good use of the mist raven at a certain point.
[3:29:00] <RoboXGP> yeah if you take a break from this game and come back it's so much easier
[3:29:38] <LordGroomp> i found the game way easier when i just took time to mark out at every bosses’ attack
[3:29:41] <IIChampagne> these shirts are my fucking flavor
[3:29:49] <LordGroomp> helped me learn the timing and maintain pma
[3:29:51] <%linkwolf4> honestly, I prefer smaller streams over larger ones. Big chatrooms are just way to much honestly
[3:30:00] <RoboXGP> you can stop bosses from attacking extra if you parry
[3:30:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> some bosses dont let you deflect tho
[3:30:01] <caja_de_ojos> cause u relax
[3:31:04] <IIChampagne> where did he go
[3:31:05] <LordGroomp> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli the undying guy lets you practice with thrusts and sweeps once you make it past free combat, was p helpful
[3:31:08] <RoboXGP> i have to start the game in big picture mode or it won't work correctly in pc
[3:31:21] <LordGroomp> @papajoestar to empty bladder and then fill it up again
[3:31:55] <IIChampagne> why doesnt he just use a 2liter soda bottle like normal people
[3:32:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yeah ive learned all i can with Undying guy
[3:32:04] <RoboXGP> just piss off stream?
[3:32:05] <Byronic_dreamer> This song kinda reminds me of the mass effect 1 credits theme
[3:32:07] <Byronic_dreamer> Kinda
[3:32:15] <Wowzerz2> What’s the music
[3:32:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dont be LTG
[3:32:51] <LordGroomp> i keep seeing prescription bottles on that naruto THROUGH PAIN shirt
[3:32:58] <%tank7013> I still can't get over recardless
[3:32:59] <LordGroomp> im not sure what that says about me
[3:33:26] <NeroInfinite> The cringe anime shirts.

[3:33:43] <TrashLeviathan> idaho

[3:34:29] <+天使42199> @LordGroomp Id buy them
[3:34:41] <+天使42199> I was playing sakiro earlier
[3:34:42] <Tucker0603> I'm currently on FFXIV
[3:34:48] <+天使42199> I beat grandma and horse guy
[3:34:48] <%characteraction> @leviathan666303 lol

[3:34:52] <MayorRev> gimme a heall yeahr
[3:34:57] <LordGroomp> @characteraction yeah sped through most of the game, it’s quite atmospheric at several points
[3:35:17] <Darthwaffler> I'm playing EDF 5
[3:35:18] <%characteraction> @天使42199 I did too
[3:35:18] <LordGroomp> fakes you out at points too, very nice
[3:35:26] <RoboXGP> Steam screenshots spoiled the game for me
[3:35:51] <TrashLeviathan> how far is woolie from grandma
[3:35:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:36:13] <LordGroomp> @leviathan666303 very close, needs to beat fat drunk man
[3:36:14] <%tank7013> @leviathan666303 Really close
[3:36:26] <Byronic_dreamer> Grandma taught me to fear old woman
[3:36:36] <Byronic_dreamer> Women*
[3:36:44] <LordGroomp> where is he progress-wise out of the memory?
[3:36:46] <%queenquagenary> Papa woolie is stream back yet
[3:37:00] <xeros720> i'm glad he got there with one memory too, i tried to beat it without one and it was just a frustrating slog
[3:37:11] <%tank7013> @LordGroomp Just beat the horse rider
[3:37:11] <Darthwaffler> Woolie and Gradma's? I feel like there is a tired -ass joke there...
[3:37:28] <%characteraction> @LordGroomp hes really close to the actually boss fight
[3:37:35] <vVAstrAVv> wait wheres the memory then? i dont have one
[3:37:49] <LordGroomp> ah good hope he got the text from the tengu, skills in there are great
[3:38:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he got one from Lu Bu
[3:38:05] <%tank7013> @vVAstrAVv An old lady early on gives you an item to access it
[3:38:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the memory
[3:38:15] <TrashLeviathan> @LordGroomp i dont think he even met the tengu yet
[3:38:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he hasnt
[3:38:24] <LordGroomp> oh :(
[3:38:42] <vVAstrAVv> oh the bell
[3:38:44] <%tank7013> @vVAstrAVv Waite never mind, think I misunderstood
[3:38:45] <Dragon_Batman> Sweet made it back in time for this stream at least.
[3:38:46] <LordGroomp> honestly air shinobi tools changed how i played the game
[3:38:59] <doctorbous> Where's Woolie?
[3:39:07] <%characteraction> bathroom
[3:39:08] <%tank7013> Or not
[3:39:12] <LordGroomp> @doctorbous fell in the toilet again
[3:39:20] <xeros720> i didn't think about air shinobi tools, but those sound amazing
[3:39:34] <LordGroomp> its kinda impressive that he can do that standing up though
[3:39:37] <TrashLeviathan> is that kirito ?
[3:39:43] <Dragon_Batman> So can you use the axe mid air with that skill? @LordGroomp
[3:39:43] <vVAstrAVv> is the tengu that purple guy on the pagoda?
[3:39:58] <xeros720> the purple dude is just a shinobi
[3:40:09] <LordGroomp> @xeros720 lets you get a breath of air and fire off fireworks at the same time
[3:40:16] <Byronic_dreamer> Nah, the tengu is one of those feather dudes with the demon masks
[3:40:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> nope
[3:40:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> that guy in the Pagoda is Pagoda guy
[3:40:32] <%tank7013> Tengu guy is in a little side area he never went to after the boss
[3:40:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its just a normal enemy
[3:40:35] <vVAstrAVv> oh. i must have missed an area
[3:40:43] <+jorgamund> where do we buy the shirts on screen now?
[3:40:45] <Byronic_dreamer> Pagoda guy is a tough boi
[3:40:48] <LordGroomp> @dragon_batman i would think so but ive mainly used shuriken fireworks and other tools i shouldnt say
[3:40:49] <xeros720> "normal" you say

[3:47:23] <samuraijakanddaxter> ps4 used ressurrection
[3:47:24] <%Solidnick18> it needs some patches
[3:47:30] <gustavozxd> I wonder if those crash reports on PS4 even matter
[3:47:37] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:47:40] <BlkFlameKami> someone send the clip to sony

[3:48:59] <That_Mojo> asking for a friend
[3:49:02] <%queenquagenary> IT ALMOST HAPPEN AGAIN
[3:49:03] <$ofloofy> LUL
[3:49:04] <%Solidnick18> stay away from that
[3:49:07] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:49:09] <%tank7013> Had a mini-heart attack right there
[3:49:12] <kaeltxwz> spearwielders are scumbags in this game
[3:49:17] <doctorbous> You can sneak around them from underneath the porch
[3:49:22] <Darthwaffler> fromsoft quite possibly has the BEST autosave system I've ever seen.
[3:49:23] <samuraijakanddaxter> the game didnt crash, it was just a mini boss
[3:49:45] <That_Mojo> the auto save in fromsoft games it pretty aggressive
[3:49:53] <LordGroomp> @mojokingizakku no but he did spoiler the BIG SPOILZ right in the SPOILER so that really opened up a new path for him
[3:50:01] <$ofloofy> @Darthwaffler Its good but like easy to miss alot of stuff from missing certain game queues xD
[3:50:02] <%Solidnick18> blood spurts Kreygasm
[3:50:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:50:02] <%jinking79> did Woolie meet the Snake ?
[3:50:12] <Darthwaffler> Did you do a thing... SAVE!
[3:50:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yep
[3:50:23] <$Thorn14> This game is very mean
[3:50:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @jinking79
[3:50:26] <That_Mojo> @LordGroomp ah, thanks for spoilering the spoiler for everyone else here too
[3:50:43] <That_Mojo> really appreciate it
[3:50:48] <samuraijakanddaxter> wha happuned to npc man?
[3:50:51] <LordGroomp> he forgot about the npc :(
[3:50:55] <Kghaleon> NPC respawns
[3:51:23] <%Solidnick18> yep
[3:51:27] <Kghaleon> It's best to not trigger the NPC until you clear out all the enemies, so NPC can help you with the boss.
[3:51:27] <+EySoyCoco> stealth and sekirun
[3:51:29] <alexandrecau> dirt in your eyes
[3:51:32] <%Solidnick18> it's pretty cool
[3:51:32] <supersanic94> POCKET SAND!
[3:51:35] <$ofloofy> they dirty banditos
[3:51:36] <%queenquagenary> shishihaw!
[3:51:37] <That_Mojo> damn, they dale from king of the hill you
[3:51:37] <alexandrecau> just like polnareff
[3:51:42] <$ofloofy> fighting dirty
[3:51:44] <kaeltxwz> enemies in this game are freaking scumbags, even by souls standards
[3:51:48] <Darthwaffler> @ofloofy True.
[3:52:06] <$Thorn14> I had to coward mode, basically kill the mobs then run away to stealth attack, I did not like this guy at all
[3:52:07] <%tank7013> Yo that's really good. Never thought to use that to cut off from them
[3:52:32] <$Thorn14> Woolie's got the right idea
[3:52:35] <+EySoyCoco> call the npc now make it a fair 2v1
[3:52:36] <samuraijakanddaxter> kill all the jobbers then get the npc
[3:52:41] <%Lion_kun> woolie hide from him and get a free stab
[3:52:45] <SchroedingersFerret> Lawd he comin
[3:52:45] <DashXero> Can we see about making it an unfair fight?
[3:52:48] <LordGroomp> its nice that woolies pretty good at deflecting already
[3:52:49] <tag545> now call for back up
[3:52:50] <Dragon_Batman> And you have gourd juice, you got this
[3:52:54] <$Thorn14> this guy uses poison eff fair fights LUL
[3:52:55] <Kghaleon> NPC dude is there for helping with this dude D:
[3:53:11] <+solzan2000> OUCH
[3:53:12] <+MrMcCrabby> This is the ninja way
[3:53:14] <That_Mojo> magic pixel
[3:53:17] <$ofloofy> No fair fights here LUL
[3:53:18] <%Solidnick18> circle strafe is really good for this
[3:53:32] <TangledVirus> Try to stealth him and get one of his life bars.
[3:53:35] <%CrazySMT417> Kill all the regular enemies, then talk to your npc friend
[3:53:40] <BusterRepukken> The tracking in this game is really bad IMO, its like Dark Souls 2 level
[3:54:01] <+Bigmeanjean> you shoulda jumped there...
[3:54:01] <tag545> no friend?
[3:54:02] <+天使42199> I think the best thing to do is to call the npc friend and kill the regular enemies really fast when hes distracting them
[3:54:04] <Ristwach> Look at Solaire just chilling by the pond LUL
[3:54:12] <+Bigmeanjean> dot dot dot
[3:54:16] <alexandrecau> hit him with the axe when blinded
[3:54:18] <Ristwach> @tag545 He never saw him
[3:54:27] <That_Mojo> all part of learning the boss's move set
[3:54:30] <Kghaleon> NPC just standing there like lol
[3:54:37] <+EySoyCoco> oil and burn the fucker also works
[3:54:43] <kaeltxwz> @CerberusDriver yeah is INSANE tha amount of tracking enemies have
[3:54:53] <LordGroomp> buddha didn’t notice you :(
[3:54:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie said fuk the npc lol
[3:55:05] <%queenquagenary> Goggles my man
[3:55:24] <%CrazySMT417> sneak in from the left, mess up the regulars. Then go for a deathblow on drunkman. Then talk to your friend npc. Always worked for me
[3:55:34] <%Solidnick18> you can just run past these guys
[3:55:39] <kaeltxwz> @CerberusDriver i was fighting a spear dude and he hit me while i was BEHIND him
[3:55:45] <Darthwaffler> @CerberusDriver The tracking seems worse than it is, considering you have infinite stamina which allow you to get in and out of conflict.
[3:55:54] <+solzan2000> run like a coward!
[3:55:57] <$KnivesEve> use your DT
[3:55:58] <+天使42199> yeah fuck those guys run past em
[3:56:02] <+korth367> @WoolieVersus you can run past these guys
[3:56:04] <BusterRepukken> also Perilious Blows literally changing mid animation to catch you
[3:56:04] <%characteraction> learning each enemy movesets is the magic of sekiro
[3:56:35] <LordGroomp> one of the loading screen tips that really should’ve been more apparent was the ‘posture regenerates way faster when blocking’
[3:56:37] <Varanoo> RESET
[3:56:38] <pantherpiss> console limitations?
[3:56:39] <+solzan2000> haha
[3:56:44] <BusterRepukken> I jumped over a Shinobi Hunter's thrust and the animation changed mid animation to catch me out of the air
[3:56:44] <%Solidnick18> yep
[3:56:57] <BusterRepukken> I think Sekiro is good but it has some real big problems
[3:57:02] <+天使42199> @CerberusDriver yeah shinobi hunters have crazy tracking
[3:57:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:57:03] <+EySoyCoco> ps4 has the same frame issues that bloodborne had, its the only bad part of this game
[3:57:16] <+天使42199> is this a ps4 pro ?
[3:57:19] <+天使42199> or og ps4
[3:57:28] <LordGroomp> @cerberusdriver sounds like he hunted you a bit too well Kappa
[3:57:37] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Or just don't fight them at all
[3:58:01] <+solzan2000> yea From ain't that great at polishing their games
[3:58:24] <gustavozxd> evergrace is pretty well polished
[3:58:27] <+天使42199> @solzan2000 you talkiing about frame rate or enemy tracking ?
[3:58:37] <+solzan2000> other games have fixed frame pacing
[3:58:44] <BusterRepukken> Also Sekiro has some of the same problems the Souls games have always had
[3:58:47] <+solzan2000> but not From lol
[3:58:57] <BusterRepukken> and its just like, you couldnt fix those in 2019 with all the experience you have now?
[3:58:58] <+天使42199> tbf its also the ps4 showing its age tbh
[3:59:04] <+solzan2000> nah not enemy tracking
[3:59:10] <samuraijakanddaxter> just kill all the guys without getting hit and without being seen
[3:59:16] <kaeltxwz> the thing i really don't like is that there is no corpse run
[3:59:16] <+EySoyCoco> the eurogamer article on performance really nailed it, if anyone is really interested
[3:59:18] <+天使42199> on pc its pretty much not an issue at all
[3:59:22] <+DesertPenguin> How far in is Woolie? I just beat the chained ogre
[3:59:23] <kaeltxwz> you simply loose half of your stuff
[3:59:30] <+solzan2000> yea on PC its all good
[3:59:30] <xeros720> i found that if i just ran across the rooftops, i'd lose em by the time i reached the other end
[3:59:31] <Tiewolf> @WoolieVersus S T O P D Y I N G
[3:59:31] <kormael> You can skip all these guys
[3:59:34] <%serranobros> just run past on the left side they lose agro
[3:59:43] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:46] <%Solidnick18> did woolie get the skill that deathblows give health back it's great
[3:59:47] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> They should just press the fix framrate button 4head

[4:01:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just blink :)
[4:01:34] <TrashLeviathan> just blink
[4:01:37] <Kghaleon> I had this problem earlier, I messed up this run all the time.
[4:01:37] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus i always associated it with not getting enough water actually
[4:01:38] <kaeltxwz> i get it from time to time
[4:01:40] <%queenquagenary> Blue light filters babe
[4:01:43] <+waltzqueen> close your eyes a minute
[4:01:44] <%jinking79> yes i get that too
[4:01:49] <$ofloofy> It happens to me when i play smash it drives me nuts
[4:01:52] <LordGroomp> you can pause this game though 🤔
[4:01:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> just see things perfectly
[4:02:18] <BusterRepukken> this is why Suppress Presence is good
[4:02:19] <LordGroomp> !NPC IGNORED!
[4:02:24] <%mistspade> do you have fireworks?
[4:02:26] <Kghaleon> I die to bosses 10 times and beat them in 1 try after sleeping. meh.
[4:02:37] <samuraijakanddaxter> this is a no deaths run from now
[4:02:49] <xeros720> do you do the thing where you die over and over for hours and then when you finally get it you don't even need to heal?
[4:02:50] <Darthwaffler> @WoolieVersus sbfpGou sbfpGi is useful here.
[4:02:54] <LordGroomp> oh fireworks wouldve been amazing to have against juzou
[4:02:58] <+Aeoneth> You can hit 1 guy from that room with shuriken and lure him to you
[4:03:04] <fabo_joyful> ceramic shards?
[4:03:05] <%characteraction> the guy that suppose to help you
[4:03:11] <xeros720> fireworks work on juzou too? god damn, those are great
[4:03:14] <DrStinkers> "Is there something i've been ignoring in this zone"
[4:03:15] <%CrazySMT417> theres an npc that will help
[4:03:20] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus kill the mooks and then talk to the NPC for 2V1
[4:03:22] <%TheOneUpWarrior> fish with your shuriken?
[4:03:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the NPC really helps
[4:03:26] <+Aeoneth> and then if you stand in the open a but you can cause juzou to walk out by lketting him spot you to yellow
[4:03:30] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> bait them like the true ninja you are
[4:03:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> just focus on taking down the small fries first
[4:03:33] <NZolozabal> BIG BOY.
[4:03:34] <samuraijakanddaxter> npc lol
[4:03:37] <buerdo> @woolieversus wanna know some cheese?
[4:03:37] <Tiewolf> @WoolieVersus Real question does this game play like tenchu or Bloodborn?
[4:03:40] <Papafleish> fart in your hand then light it with the flamethrower
[4:03:42] <+Kanax55> woolieMIRIN
[4:03:43] <+hax_metatron> He's right there
[4:03:43] <LordGroomp> im gonna cry if he doesn’t see the npc
[4:03:44] <+JustToWatch> what I did was aggro the boss then just run around killing the others, until it was only Jouzo, then I activated the npc
[4:03:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes there
[4:03:45] <SixthSun2> Blind
[4:03:48] <+deidriel> behind you
[4:03:48] <tag545> ha haha
[4:03:50] <%tank7013> You looked right at him while you said that
[4:03:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> no Woolie
[4:03:50] <+SnipSnips> there is a way to only pull the boss
[4:03:52] <+hax_metatron> Near the entrance
[4:03:54] <+deidriel> in the bushes
[4:03:55] <%serranobros> @WoolieVersus you can sneak in and backstab a shield guy, kill the archer and clean up the rest, you can then get a free stealth hit on the boss and activate the npc to help you
[4:03:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> that bushes
[4:04:00] <%Solidnick18> guy pls
[4:04:01] <%tank7013> More towards Juzou
[4:04:02] <%Solidnick18> lol
[4:04:03] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:04:03] <xeros720> right side of the pond here

[4:04:22] <+hax_metatron> JEEEENNNKIIIIINNNNSSSSSS
[4:04:25] <Kghaleon> I just cleared all the enemies then had NPC help me with the big dude.
[4:04:25] <xeros720> i don't even blame woolie, i didn't even see it on his screen until then
[4:04:27] <Tiewolf> Like I need to know if this plays like Tenchu!
[4:04:32] <samuraijakanddaxter> npc enters the frey
[4:04:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NOW ATTACK!!!!
[4:04:37] <+shradke> this is gonna be a fun brawl lol
[4:04:39] <LordGroomp> @woolieversus he respawns
[4:04:39] <+天使42199> CHARGE PogChamp
[4:04:41] <+solzan2000> either wolf is short or that dude is tall asf
[4:04:46] <samuraijakanddaxter> oh lawd
[4:04:47] <steelmorrigan> It's Toshiro fuckin Mifune!
[4:04:50] <SixthSun2> Let him handle the mooks
[4:04:52] <%characteraction> fight!!!
[4:04:55] <Kghaleon> Dude dies to the regular enemies too fast.
[4:04:57] <+hax_metatron> TARKUS TARKUS TARKUS
[4:05:01] <Tucker0603> Told ya he loeroys
[4:05:02] <@akuda_bar> TARKUS
[4:05:17] <Dragon_Batman> Not shure how much he has left
[4:05:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes dead :(
[4:05:22] <samuraijakanddaxter> go for jouzo
[4:05:22] <+solzan2000> lol
[4:05:24] <$ofloofy> F
[4:05:28] <BlkFlameKami> F
[4:05:28] <randomness_yo> He got rekted
[4:05:32] <+DarkOnyx7> rip BibleThump
[4:05:35] <+天使42199> bo rai cho
[4:05:35] <kaeltxwz> F
[4:05:35] <%characteraction> F
[4:05:36] <Varanoo> F
[4:05:36] <mccf> TARKUS TARK- oh
[4:05:37] <SixthSun2> Shoulda let him handle mooks, he can't handle Juzou
[4:05:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He did it all for Lord Kuro :(
[4:05:44] <Ristwach> Should have saved him after you cleared out the adds
[4:05:45] <Darthwaffler> BLACK! IRON! TARKUS!
[4:05:46] <Dragon_Batman> F BibleThump
[4:05:46] <Tiewolf> No don't let him die, he gives you loot!
[4:05:46] <NZolozabal> Should have taken out the jobbers first and wittled the Big Guy's health to halfway first.
[4:05:47] <mccf> Is he gone gone?
[4:05:54] <%tank7013> This guy's actually really good at one on one. If he was just a little better he could solo Juzou
[4:05:54] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> dont let npc dieee--- noooo
[4:05:58] <+Bigmeanjean> he is super helpful... woolie doesnt understand...
[4:05:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Tiewolf dude i tried
[4:05:58] <TrashLeviathan> youre supposed to fight big boy while he fights the ads
[4:05:59] <mccf> If Woolie dies here i mean
[4:06:02] <$ofloofy> he helped you long enough for a 1v1 he tried Kappa
[4:06:03] <+starkandstag> F
[4:06:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its hard
[4:06:05] <Ristwach> He is a Tarkus after you clear the adds
[4:06:06] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus if ya die he might respawn so you might have a second chance if you fail
[4:06:08] <SixthSun2> He can handle Mooks, but not mr Drunkard
[4:06:15] <+Link232> Found the best way to use him is go in first, clear the mooks, then call him to distract the boss
[4:06:17] <Wildzide> I think he is just there to help clean the mobs while he distracts the boss
[4:06:17] <%characteraction> maybe kill all the enemys and go for him
[4:06:20] <BusterRepukken> THAT TRACKING
[4:06:24] <+Bigmeanjean> YES
[4:06:26] <+天使42199> Honestly if youre really fast you can kill the lil bitches quickly then tag tem juzou with him
[4:06:31] <DashXero> Look for him after eliminating the small fry?
[4:06:32] <Tiewolf> So this plays like Tenchu Got it
[4:06:32] <tag545> charge in. clean up then call him. the double team helps with flinching
[4:06:33] <LTKonnor> BLOODBORNE-LEVEL TRACKING
[4:06:34] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> You can kill all of the minions and then summon him
[4:06:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> What does he give you if he survives?
[4:06:35] <%TheOneUpWarrior> yoooo finally saved enough for the butterfly kunai
[4:06:35] <+EySoyCoco> sneak one on his ass woolz
[4:06:35] <+shradke> npc boy is basically an aggro machine for big boss once adds are gone
[4:06:37] <%tank7013> @WoolieVersus He's really good at baiting Juzou if you speak to him after clearing the adds
[4:06:38] <+korth367> @WoolieVersus i suggest less dodging and more parrying
[4:06:38] <kaeltxwz> the stupid tracking in this game gave me ds2 flashbacks
[4:06:43] <BusterRepukken> dark souls 2 level tracking
[4:06:43] <%masterfire23> tracc
[4:06:45] <gustavozxd> I hate tracking so much oh my God
[4:06:47] <Kghaleon> You can cheese all these minibosses with stealth, takes off a pip of their health for free.
[4:06:48] <samuraijakanddaxter> kill the jobbers then get npc
[4:06:49] <FrenchTact1cs> I used him after clearing the grunts. Way better
[4:06:50] <OozieStream> For a drunk he can hit that telegrahed S T O M P good.
[4:06:51] <LordGroomp> @woolieversus stealth all the ads then deaggro big boy and have npc help
[4:06:52] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus Kill the adds, talk to helper boi, team up on boss He's slow enough that you can loop him around before you sprint to the guy
[4:06:53] <Varanoo> Kill the mobs THEN get him
[4:06:53] <NZolozabal> Is it Dark Souls 2 levels of tracking?
[4:06:54] <%CrazySMT417> Clearing out the regulars, stealth blowing, then calling out your buddy works best
[4:07:08] <+fizzguy47> @nzolozabal yes
[4:07:09] <samuraijakanddaxter> he takes jouzos attention away from yoy
[4:07:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> what does he give you if you survive?
[4:07:16] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> this game jump dodge
[4:07:16] <buerdo> There is a run
[4:07:17] <+masta7> Kill all of the normal enemies then talk to him
[4:07:17] <+HypotheticalWalrus> yah
[4:07:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> is it worth it?
[4:07:18] <+solzan2000> means being smart
[4:07:21] <+Bigmeanjean> Y is woolie so resistant to stealth..../...
[4:07:23] <Ristwach> You did it before
[4:07:23] <Varanoo> Yes
[4:07:24] <+EySoyCoco> clear the mobs mean shinobi shit
[4:07:25] <+korth367> do the thing you were doing before
[4:07:27] <nioh54> or just run around and kill mobs, they will fuck you up
[4:07:28] <%tank7013> Only if you wanna do it slow
[4:07:30] <SixthSun2> You're a shinobi, laming it out is your lifestyle
[4:07:30] <tag545> kill mobs then lead boss to him
[4:07:31] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> this game has jump dodge too**
[4:07:34] <Tucker0603> lame it out
[4:07:34] <LordGroomp> @woolieversus fireworks are amazing in general also
[4:07:35] <%serranobros> woolie you can get a stealth hit on jouzo after you clear the mobs
[4:07:35] <Ristwach> You did it before by kiting the mobs
[4:07:36] <primarch_lupercal> its a tenchu game man
[4:07:36] <%CrazySMT417> you got this
[4:07:37] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus Yeah, you can use your tools to force one dude to rush alone
[4:07:37] <+Robo_Wizard1> The mobs spread out as they chase you, so yeah be lame and let them spread out until you can 1v1 them
[4:07:38] <+Bigmeanjean> IT IS DIFFERESNT
[4:07:39] <$ofloofy> Be a hugee coward
[4:07:39] <Papafleish> you're a shinobi not a walking bunker
[4:07:39] <samuraijakanddaxter> youve managed it before
[4:07:40] <Futurecity10> Almost like fun isnt part of the game
[4:07:41] <primarch_lupercal> not a souls game
[4:07:42] <+FreddyLeeSavage> no dude kill all the mobs quick n run away
[4:07:45] <+HypotheticalWalrus> laming it out is the true ninja way
[4:07:47] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus play like Pat, coward it out
[4:07:47] <Papafleish> no they don't
[4:07:49] <+Kanax55> You can clear the mobs fast with 『SHINOBI WAY』
[4:07:49] <Applaudedlemon> Not really you can kill the two to the left then deal with the mob their not hard
[4:07:51] <+theshinyhunterdom> Pat Coward Mode activate
[4:07:52] <+fizzguy47> yes
[4:07:52] <+shradke> if you play fast and aggressive you can run a train pretty easy in that arena
[4:07:53] <+EySoyCoco> ask yourself, what would Pat do?
[4:07:56] <LordGroomp> play like a ninja
[4:07:58] <nioh54> @WoolieVersus also, try to get a sneak attack on the big fat guy
[4:08:02] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Not a Souls game LUL
[4:08:06] <Varanoo> Shinobi are SUPPOSE to be cowards
[4:08:07] <%serranobros> no woolie this game loves it when you are a coward!
[4:08:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @korth367
[4:08:11] <Kghaleon> if the boss loses you, you can stealth him for free pip damage.
[4:08:11] <caja_de_ojos> dude ninjas always lame it out
[4:08:12] <+solzan2000> yup
[4:08:12] <%CrazySMT417> this game is kill and run. Rinse and repeat
[4:08:15] <+sumire_gelato> they all aggro on the guy, you can drop all the mobs then go one on one
[4:08:15] <tag545> don't need to just clean up then bait him to the guy
[4:08:16] <+天使42199> You can call the NPC and kill the mobs REALLY fast since they are distracted
[4:08:16] <BusterRepukken> The game isn't fair enough for you to go balls out, IMO
[4:08:19] <xeros720> nah, no way
[4:08:26] <+天使42199> you dont have to lame it out like that
[4:08:27] <+Link232> Stealth in this game is more about getting the alpha strike, getting a deathblow charge off
[4:08:27] <+MrMcCrabby> I dont think thats the case for this game
[4:08:28] <+Robo_Wizard1> I wouldn't say you need to run and restealth, just spread them out
[4:08:30] <+korth367> Be a MASSIVE COWARD to win
[4:08:32] <Dragon_Batman> This is FromSoft, they have obtuse ways of doing things
[4:08:32] <xeros720> this game is designed for you killing "one guy" then dealing with whoever is left
[4:08:33] <+korth367> RUN more
[4:08:36] <+Bigmeanjean> be a coward woolie
[4:08:40] <FrenchTact1cs> You can full aggro them pretty quick
[4:08:48] <+solzan2000> LOL
[4:08:50] <samuraijakanddaxter> pats coward strategy worked and the npc was alive at the end too
[4:08:52] <%CrazySMT417> I thought the same thing man, gets easier if you run away
[4:09:00] <+Kanax55> You can kill all those mobs, easy just running in circles and attacking quickly
[4:09:00] <buerdo> Blitzkrieg works decently on boss mobs
[4:09:02] <xeros720> it's like Last of Us stealth
[4:09:04] <+shradke> liam beat jozou this way too i think
[4:09:05] <DashXero> The stealth loop of this game is more akin to Tenchu - where you had to be stealthy quickly and on the fly.
[4:09:06] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus you can use the ninja star arm to get dudes to charge you alone
[4:09:09] <%tank7013> You don't really have to pick them off one by one as long as you can kite Juzou well
[4:09:10] <+JustToWatch> woolie shinobi is just another word for noble coward
[4:09:15] <LTKonnor> You need to rely on tactical backdowns
[4:09:18] <+G_Thunders> That’s the strat everyone used in every Souls game though
[4:09:18] <haitakaa> get good Kappa
[4:09:19] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus no, kill the 2 on the left sneak behind the guy with the shield next to Juzou and stealth kill him. Then rush the archer to his left then you just have 2 sword guys and a sheild to deal with
[4:09:21] <+EySoyCoco> the game kind of funnels to fight like the enemy wants you to. be a ninja
[4:09:23] <tag545> just bait the boss to him after killing the adds
[4:09:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> True Cowards
[4:09:29] <+HypotheticalWalrus> I feel that you could beast mode it but you would have to be a god
[4:09:30] <LordGroomp> the game is for 1v1s not 2v7AndABigBoy
[4:09:32] <Royboy97> i just ran past them
[4:09:33] <+korth367> you can totally do it if you run in if you're good enough
[4:09:34] <$ofloofy> there is tottally different ways gotta learn the patterns and stuff
[4:09:34] <nioh54> they want you to think more than anything, like sneak attacking the boss @WoolieVersus
[4:09:38] <+天使42199> Like I said you can call the NPC and kill the mobs while they are aggroing him
[4:09:42] <+EySoyCoco> yeah that is fair
[4:09:43] <Kghaleon> You can do it either way, just depends on how much suffering you want to take.
[4:09:48] <Ristwach> LUL
[4:09:48] <+天使42199> they mobs are very easy to kill when distracted
[4:09:51] <kaeltxwz> the game REALLY heate this building hum?
[4:09:51] <FrenchTact1cs> Not cowards, wise
[4:09:52] <%serranobros> you dont have to go far, they lose agro at the pond..
[4:09:52] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Hone your cowardliness
[4:09:57] <+天使42199> just run around juzou until they are dead
[4:09:57] <samuraijakanddaxter> its a legit strategy
[4:10:00] <+theshinyhunterdom> He wants to hide in the shadows
[4:10:01] <+livi242> If you can kill the mobs fast it’s pretty easy
[4:10:11] <xeros720> this is not a stealth game
[4:10:18] <+korth367> sekiro is just a dude with a wooden arm, he isn't raiden
[4:10:19] <Papafleish> when I play metal gear I run like a bitch
[4:10:19] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> to be fair, them ganging on ya makes them the true cowards thou
[4:10:21] <%TheOneUpWarrior> a way to win without the cheese
[4:10:21] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> I will say it becomes MUCH easier to be a stealthy killing bastard as you get better stealth skills later
[4:10:26] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Group them up and poke them to death
[4:10:27] <+天使42199> combat game with stealth elements
[4:10:27] <haitakaa> just gotta get good at the parries if you wanna just run in
[4:10:29] <+WorldsBestPanda> Woolie easily could have gotten the supress presence ability.
[4:10:29] <Kghaleon> These are just tips, not the required way Wools. :p
[4:10:29] <%frankthetank285> woolie this is not a stealth game
[4:10:30] <+hoenhime344> @WoolieVersus you CAN do that. but just later. you are still SUUUUPER EARLY
[4:10:32] <Royboy97> @WoolieVersus just run past the mobs my guy, this is a from soft game lol
[4:10:36] <warofdarknessfang> an old ninja technique involved attacking and running when facing multiple foes
[4:10:36] <nioh54> i dont think this game wants you to do that either
[4:10:36] <chroma3> thats exactly what tenchu is like
[4:10:37] <%serranobros> the problem is you're going in FULL coward, you need HALF coward
[4:10:37] <%tank7013> In this game it seems like the quick way is usually the run in like an idiot way
[4:10:38] <+HypotheticalWalrus> those guys you could probably just kill
[4:10:39] <Dragon_Batman> I think this game is a mix of combat action with stealth
[4:10:45] <tag545> don't run out of agro just kill the adds and have the boss chase you to him
[4:10:46] <+Aeoneth> THere's a run which can let you kill 90% of the enemies, but it's narrow
[4:10:48] <Limes528> @WoolieVersus You can ignore this first mob completely. They won't follow you into the boss arena. Why are you doing this to yourself?
[4:10:48] <buerdo> Fromsoft said this isnt a stealth game
[4:10:49] <+Kanax55> You can skip these adds
[4:10:54] <%CrazySMT417> that is my one downside to this game
[4:10:55] <Heartless_01> running away like a true hero
[4:10:56] <%robobeau> @woolieversus You can absolutely sneak all the way back to the boss, save for that first archer
[4:11:00] <Papafleish> you haven't hit shinobi puberty yet
[4:11:02] <FrenchTact1cs> Youre only gonna stealth, 1 or 2 per fight rn
[4:11:04] <LordGroomp> @woolieversus skip these fools
[4:11:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:11:07] <+天使42199> its a combat game with stealth elements. use stealth to pick off one or two guys, then fight the rest
[4:11:08] <%characteraction> I just ran past everyone and went straight to the big fatty
[4:11:09] <+G_Thunders> You don’t need to kill this group
[4:11:10] <+korth367> @WoolieVersus skip these first guys
[4:11:12] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Why keep fightin and using a flask on these guys when you can just sneak around them?
[4:11:13] <%robobeau> also you can sneak kill the left most shield dude
[4:11:17] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus assume it's new game plus where your stealth is so maxed you can kill and disappear
[4:11:18] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah you can skip these guys, but take out the arrow guys @WoolieVersus
[4:11:20] <%serranobros> woolie run past them man
[4:11:24] <Limes528> No, Woolie. You're fine. Just skip tis first mob
[4:11:26] <+hoenhime344> @w
[4:11:27] <%serranobros> you dont have to fight those
[4:11:28] <+Kanax55> fight them all at once, You can do it!
[4:11:31] <+korth367> no they won't
[4:11:31] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> you'll get abilities that just passively make you harder you be noticed etc.
[4:11:34] <Limes528> No they won't
[4:11:34] <%CrazySMT417> they wont
[4:11:36] <Royboy97> it is
[4:11:37] <+Kanax55> They dont leash that long, they stop
[4:11:37] <%serranobros> no they lose agro on the left
[4:11:37] <+Link232> Nah the back mob looses aggro after the lake
[4:11:38] <samuraijakanddaxter> you can skip these guys altogether
[4:11:38] <+天使42199> no thewy wont
[4:11:40] <%jinking79> game on that hard note of learned what fail at and succeed
[4:11:41] <TrashLeviathan> they wont
[4:11:43] <+天使42199> they wont care
[4:11:43] <DashXero> Just keep doing what you're doing.
[4:11:44] <$ofloofy> doesnt a fog wall block em out anyway?
[4:11:45] <+hoenhime344> @WoolieVersus this first mob, you can skip. just talk to the NPC and boss
[4:11:45] <+天使42199> just run
[4:11:53] <%CrazySMT417> follow the roofs
[4:11:53] <buerdo> No
[4:11:55] <pielputreil> hey, is he not finish this game?
[4:11:56] <caja_de_ojos> they don't follow
[4:11:59] <+korth367> finally
[4:12:00] <Papafleish> try diplomacy
[4:12:01] <+天使42199> if you have any doubts run past them on the roof
[4:12:03] <+hoenhime344> @WoolieVersus but i would take the rooftops
[4:12:08] <+korth367> you
[4:12:09] <+korth367> did it
[4:12:10] <%serranobros> there you go!
[4:12:11] <+EySoyCoco> hiding under those boards is also good
[4:12:25] <Darthwaffler> sbfpYeyeye
[4:12:30] <Limes528> You're supposed to use the roof to skip the first mob, then talk to the npc to start the battle. This isn't meant to be a stealth zone at all
[4:12:34] <%serranobros> serranobros subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[4:12:45] <BusterRepukken> also sometimes, you straight up just dont block when you press the button; it doesnt come out
[4:12:58] <samuraijakanddaxter> now just kill everyone
[4:13:02] <+Adriangabs> oraaaaaa
[4:13:11] <+korth367> @WoolieVersus use the house like before
[4:13:12] <%MadMan0017> MadMan0017 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[4:13:14] <+hoenhime344> TALK TO THE MAN
[4:13:18] <haitakaa> if you stealth attack Juzuo you can eliminate one of his life bars instantly
[4:13:23] <LordGroomp> oh no woolie learned the wrong lesson from us
[4:13:25] <Ristwach> Just kite like you did before
[4:13:26] <+theshinyhunterdom> sbfpOmg doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeamR doodStare
[4:13:30] <Kghaleon> If you run near the NPC, you can accidentally trigger him too early
[4:13:33] <+shradke> npc triggers with proximity to boss btw
[4:13:36] <+Link232> Don't neccesarily need to keep dropping aggro, you can just kite Juzuo around, kill the archers first
[4:13:44] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Leave the man until Juzo's last bar of health
[4:13:45] <Papafleish> poop in your hand and throw it at them
[4:14:05] <BusterRepukken> you lead him to the NPC
[4:14:06] <Ristwach> No
[4:14:08] <+korth367> that's fine
[4:14:08] <+hoenhime344> @Papafleish hahahaha funny you should mention that move :p
[4:14:08] <BusterRepukken> by accident
[4:14:08] <%CrazySMT417> thats odd
[4:14:15] <%tank7013> Huh, didn't know that could happen
[4:14:16] <+Robo_Wizard1> it's cause you dragged enemies to him
[4:14:18] <Ristwach> You lead them to the NPC @WoolieVersus
[4:14:18] <samuraijakanddaxter> proximity
[4:14:26] <+HypotheticalWalrus> yeah you can draw aggro to him
[4:14:32] <NeroInfinite> Ya lead the baddies to him
[4:14:56] <+solzan2000> Juzou is tricky
[4:14:59] <+天使42199> You let them to his aggro zone
[4:15:00] <%serranobros> you have to clear all the ads in one go
[4:15:01] <MForan98> Yeah, they got to close
[4:15:02] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Also the fireworks work real well on Juzou
[4:15:07] <+fizzguy47> slow and steady
[4:15:17] <buerdo> You drew aggrotowards him
[4:15:19] <LordGroomp> woolie’s internalizing the lessons too quickly oh no
[4:15:25] <samuraijakanddaxter> welp, this is the boss we're gonna be stuck on tonight lads
[4:15:26] <gryffinp> *cautiously opens stream* Ok good it's just this guy, I've seen this.
[4:15:30] <+fizzguy47> bait out long recovery attacks
[4:15:39] <+TheoTTree> This guy is rough
[4:15:58] <+TheoShodi> BIG BOI
[4:15:59] <AG147Requiem> Easy mode is now selectable
[4:16:02] <%characteraction> slow and delayed attacks are always the worse shit
[4:16:14] <+theshinyhunterdom> This big got them Thicc attacks tho
[4:16:15] <+hoenhime344> and JUMP the sweep
[4:16:26] <EpitaphOfOndri> play them footsies man
[4:16:32] <+shradke> npc was fighting the first group lol
[4:16:33] <xeros720> jumping the sweeps is so hard to learn
[4:16:41] <BusterRepukken> You can use the other guy, just dont lead the mobs right to him.
[4:16:42] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Only use your striker on Juzou's last bar of health @WoolieVersus
[4:16:46] <samuraijakanddaxter> theres too many factors at play to clearly communicate how exactly the npc can help lol
[4:16:46] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Stun the fucker with fireworks
[4:16:46] <LordGroomp> buddha noticed you!
[4:16:48] <+hoenhime344> lol yea, dont let the NPC fight the first pack
[4:16:48] <tag545> sprint kill adds. lead only the boss to npc. free damage is free so take it
[4:17:07] <Someguy893> I've noticed that you're getting hit due to your posture breaking, it's fine to back off a bit to let that recover.
[4:17:09] <RoboXGP> Meryl?
[4:17:10] <+天使42199> What I do is I kill the enemies while they are attacking NPC, and then tag team juzou for a bit with him
[4:17:11] <Ristwach> Just don't lead the mob to the NPC
[4:17:11] <buerdo> How far did woolie get in the ashita outskirts?
[4:17:11] <+theshinyhunterdom> Lmao
[4:17:11] <%CrazySMT417> follow the rooftops, wont alret them
[4:17:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Codec Call

[4:17:22] <samuraijakanddaxter> snake?
[4:17:23] <NeroInfinite> COLONEL?
[4:17:24] <Varanoo> COLONEL
[4:17:25] <Limes528> The mob is actually super managable if you rush in with the npc
[4:17:28] <+hoenhime344> wolf IS SNAKEW
[4:17:28] <@akuda_bar> snake has to call to ask for help because his ass is dummy thicc
[4:17:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @mayorrev
[4:17:31] <randomness_yo> Snake? Can you hear me?
[4:17:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Snake, dinner is ready
[4:17:34] <worldbrand> D U M M Y
[4:17:43] <MayorRev> hhrrrrnn, colonel, i'm trying to beat sekiro
[4:17:44] <NZolozabal> Giving Snake advice on missions Woolie?
[4:17:45] <%queenquagenary> No dinner until you finish your Drunkard
[4:17:56] <%crudleydrawn> colonel im trying to sneak around this big drunk dude but my ass keeps clapping
[4:17:57] <+天使42199> @Limes528 yeah people are making it seem like you have to kill the mob onb your own- you dont they die very easy when they are distracted
[4:18:01] <BusterRepukken> nah Woolie, you're fine. the block literally doesnt work sometimes.
[4:18:18] <nickmanx> You can get a stealth attak on drunkard
[4:18:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:18:20] <Kghaleon> Sekiro man has posture too
[4:18:23] <laguerrilha> Chat besides that codec call and the Kim Possible beep, what are other good ringtones to use?
[4:18:23] <%CrazySMT417> run, kill, repeat
[4:18:25] <+TheoTTree> You gotta get in there more man; you can just plow through these smaller enemies with aggression. <3
[4:18:29] <Ristwach> yeyeyeye
[4:18:33] <RoboXGP> a regular phone sound
[4:18:35] <Someguy893> you got this, just need to be careful with your posture breaking
[4:18:38] <gryffinp> Now, imagine doing this without the axe
[4:18:46] <BusterRepukken> @CrazySMT417 i know he has posture, Im saying pressing the button, sometimes doesnt even work at all
[4:18:52] <gryffinp> Not because I didn't have the axe, but because I was too stubborn to leave the area and go install it
[4:19:01] <%CrazySMT417> then wait for him to go back, then stealtblow
[4:19:02] <Limes528> @CerberusDriver That hasn't been the case for me
[4:19:03] <samuraijakanddaxter> lets go, no deaths run
[4:19:04] <gryffinp> had to manually kill those shield bastards every time
[4:19:06] <AG147Requiem> That sounds like a controller problem
[4:19:10] <+hoenhime344> @CerberusDriver the block dosent work at time because when you follow through with a swing it commits. you have a .2 sec window to cancel the slash into a block.
[4:19:31] <+solzan2000> lol
[4:19:35] <@akuda_bar> hahaha
[4:19:36] <+Kanax55> woolieOMG woolieOMG

[4:19:46] <+天使42199> tag team juzou with him
[4:19:48] <keyworthe> as soon as i saw shield enemies i ran and installed the axe cause it's just stupid to fight them without it
[4:19:49] <@akuda_bar> *comes sprinting around the corner* HELP PLEASE
[4:19:55] <+Tuna_Can_0> I couldnt mash X fast enough
[4:19:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YEAH! TEAMUPS

[4:20:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yo NPC guy is a hero!
[4:20:33] <haitakaa> if he saved that deathblow for the second life bar would it have been over inistantly?
[4:20:38] <+Tuna_Can_0> oil and fire works too
[4:20:39] <Ristwach> Yeyeyeye
[4:20:39] <laguerrilha> power of friendship
[4:20:40] <dmysta3000> So this is the closest this game gets to actual coop?
[4:20:45] <gryffinp> No, the second life bar only appears after the deathblow
[4:20:46] <Limes528> See, this guy is ace. He handles the mob really well too
[4:20:47] <+天使42199> @haitakaa you have to do the deathblow to remove the life bar
[4:20:49] <+Adriangabs> what are those bars at the top and bottom for?
[4:20:50] <%tank7013> Yo that was a good dodge there NPC
[4:20:54] <Ristwach> Tarkus! Tarkus! Tarkus!
[4:20:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GET UP!
[4:21:00] <+TheoTTree> @WoolieVersus Holding guard up makes your posture recuperate faster, just a quick heads up <3

[4:22:24] <+MrMcCrabby> share it with your siegmeyer
[4:22:24] <gryffinp> "Sake is a drink meant for sharing" That's like... the 14th most japanese thing in this game.
[4:22:30] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Time for the real boss woolieF
[4:22:41] <LordGroomp> @eva_unit02 all sake except for a kind emma says is especially for sculptor is for anyone you grt different stories from different npcs
[4:22:42] <+Tuna_Can_0> this guy just watched the murder go down
[4:22:43] <+天使42199> @Robo_Wizard1 pretty sure you get the sake from juzou
[4:22:46] <+theshinyhunterdom> Warm Sakeee?! VERRRY GUUUUD

[4:22:49] <+hoenhime344> now...who ready for the boss?
[4:22:49] <%tank7013> Why can't he talk to him?
[4:22:50] <Kghaleon> This dude should give you something for keeping him alive.
[4:22:53] <+天使42199> the npc died in my game and I got the sake
[4:22:55] <+Link232> I think you need to kill the last add to talk to him
[4:22:55] <gryffinp> Maybe you can't talk to that guy until you kill that one dude?
[4:22:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes now purposeless
[4:23:02] <@akuda_bar> oh yeah it does look like ueda
[4:23:03] <alexandrecau> He survived but he is dead inside

[4:26:53] <%FrostedZaibatsu> mid-boss
[4:26:58] <%TheOneUpWarrior> its like the pokemon gym gym and gym
[4:27:00] <RoboXGP> If you can find the used panties you get a extra gulp.

[4:27:58] <gryffinp> Smooth
[4:27:59] <+Tuna_Can_0> to be honest, I cannot tell the difference between a boss, mid-boss or just some tough enemy

[4:28:57] <Zayasu> @woolieversus ceck the walls
[4:28:59] <gryffinp> @This_is_marco As near as I can figure, it's "[name] the [enemy class]" is tough enemy, "[uniquely formatted name]" is miniboss, and cutscenes preseage a "real" boss
[4:29:08] <Papafleish> reeeeeeeee secret
[4:29:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Inosuke you have done nothing but fail?

[4:29:53] <DashXero> Don't listen to him. He's not anywhere near as cool as you.
[4:29:58] <%serranobros> DONT USE THAT SEED
[4:30:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he even says he has to save his mother after
[4:30:05] <+MegaMillenniumX> you missed a hidden wall
[4:30:17] <%characteraction> wools its a secret room you didn't go too
[4:30:29] <gryffinp> For reference, you do not strictly need the snap seed. I know, because I totally misused the exactly one this guy gives you and then won on a later try anyway
[4:30:32] <Ristwach> Ahh
[4:30:34] <DashXero> OH CRAP. It's THAT GUY!

[4:38:29] <%crudleydrawn> so does this game have a dub option? i couldn't even imagine this game in English
[4:38:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> they explain this with Hanbei too

[4:38:35] <+sumire_gelato> "If your Hp hits zero it's game over!"
[4:38:38] <%GraceTBM> It wouldn't be a Souls style game unless you had to use a mechanic before it's explained
[4:38:42] <+JustToWatch> this fight is easy, just never get hit
[4:38:43] <+peanutsondabeach2005> @animaniacs1126 there is an english dub

[4:40:35] <+deidriel> you can throw shurikens while shes in the air to bring her down
[4:40:35] <%robobeau> @woolieversus Ninja Granny HATES it when you shuriken her out of the air
[4:40:35] <+SilverDevilfish> apatJpeg
[4:40:36] <+theshinyhunterdom> Grandma Goku fucked you up son
[4:40:39] <Varanoo> mada mada
[4:40:40] <TrashLeviathan> remember shurikens are useful for enemies in the air
[4:40:41] <keyworthe> you can shuriken her woolie
[4:40:44] <Kghaleon> If you dodge and R1 it, she has trouble dealing with it.
[4:40:55] <%TheOneUpWarrior> oof the grandma mada mada
[4:40:56] <+JustToWatch> I did this fight before the horse guy, that was a dumb move on my part
[4:40:56] <+ALTRNico> snipe her when she jumps
[4:40:59] <+EySoyCoco> shuriken on the air works great yeah
[4:41:01] <keyworthe> SHURIKEN THAT BITCH
[4:41:07] <CuttleCrow> @JustToWatch same
[4:41:08] <%serranobros> you can knock her down when he's on the strings
[4:41:11] <+hax_metatron> WOOLIE. Channel your fighting game spirit. This is it. Deflect, attack, Shuriken in air. Fast. You can do it!!!!!!!
[4:41:12] <%serranobros> with shuriken
[4:41:12] <+EySoyCoco> yeah, spam that shit
[4:41:15] <+MegaMillenniumX> shuriken her out of the air @woolieversus
[4:41:15] <Byronic_dreamer> Shurikens and the follow up slash you can get for them are a life saver here
[4:41:20] <Ks201> when she is no longer on the ground or a.string a shuriken will knock her down
[4:41:25] <gryffinp> @JustToWatch Same, I forced my way through the entire sequence as soon as I got the bell offering
[4:41:26] <+theshinyhunterdom> Grandma a bad bitch LUL
[4:41:29] <laguerrilha> Impressive that Inosuke came out alive after fighting her
[4:41:32] <Darthwaffler> hype
[4:41:35] <Ristwach> My grandma can't be THIS stylish
[4:41:35] <Byronic_dreamer> As well as the combat technique that closes a lot of ground, I forget what it’s called
[4:41:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheoShodi
[4:41:40] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Fireckrackers?
[4:41:41] <ScreamLord> Kaede from Red Ninja but old!
[4:41:42] <%characteraction> @JustToWatch i did too and I think it was a good idea
[4:41:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Look at this actual ninja, unlike Naruto
[4:41:49] <+TheoShodi> sorry caps
[4:41:49] <+hax_metatron> Fucking character, action. Right here. All there.
[4:41:51] <the1manmoshpit> knock her ass out the air with shuriken

[4:41:57] <+hax_metatron> GOTY
[4:42:01] <+TheoShodi> we should have this cool granny as MC
[4:42:11] <%GraceTBM> How many bosses in is this?
[4:42:11] <CuttleCrow> the toughest characters are always the ones that are the same height
[4:42:12] <samuraijakanddaxter> smash that old bitchs wooden fuckin teeth out cmon
[4:42:16] <gryffinp> woolie runnin scared
[4:42:20] <xeros720> that shuriken followup is s damn stinger, i really need to use it more
[4:42:24] <Darthwaffler> sbfpScared
[4:42:28] <+hax_metatron> @teramercier this could be your first. There’s a lot of this game
[4:42:36] <+EySoyCoco> this is the first or second main boss. just saying LUL
[4:42:53] <+EySoyCoco> and it looks like lady maria
[4:43:09] <%GraceTBM> You can fight bosses in a different order? That sounds like some great replay value
[4:43:12] <+peanutsondabeach2005> wools' game face
[4:43:17] <Papafleish> uhhhh
[4:43:18] <TrashLeviathan> this is eileen + maria
[4:43:19] <%characteraction> @EySoyCoco i can see that actually
[4:43:20] <+hax_metatron> Lady Maria got older PogChamp
[4:43:20] <gryffinp> Woolie is clearly unfooled
[4:43:21] <+sleepy_pink> try using a snap seed now
[4:43:23] <Ristwach> Mada Mada!
[4:43:25] <laguerrilha> wut
[4:43:27] <WSintai> Almost all of the Boss Fights in this game are Vergil fights
[4:43:29] <+dukenux> woolieS woolieT
[4:43:29] <+天使42199> PHASE 2
[4:43:29] <NeroInfinite> And first phase done
[4:43:31] <Varanoo> SNAP SEED NOW
[4:43:31] <$ofloofy> A FAKE
[4:43:32] <+MrMcCrabby> wut
[4:43:32] <OkamiDude15> A SUBSTITUTION JUTSU?
[4:43:33] <+ccwettr123> so you finished step 1. Now what about 2-10?
[4:43:34] <%KaizenChaos> eqiup seeed

[4:43:36] <LordGroomp> MADA MADA, FUCKER
[4:43:40] <%CrazySMT417> snapbean man
[4:43:42] <SchroedingersFerret> 10 PERCENT OF MY POWER
[4:43:43] <mccf> This music man
[4:43:46] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> 2dnt phase Itachi time
[4:43:46] <CuttleCrow> Woolie's played a souls game before granny
[4:43:47] <Dragon_Batman> There she is
[4:43:48] <NeroInfinite> snap seed
[4:43:52] <+dukenux> MUDA MUDA
[4:43:55] <Varanoo> SNAP SEED
[4:43:57] <+EySoyCoco> @characteraction it's like, what's in store if you are still dropping tutorials
[4:43:58] <Ristwach> LUL
[4:43:59] <%queenquagenary> peas
[4:43:59] <+peanutsondabeach2005> uh oh
[4:44:00] <+peanutsondabeach2005> here comes the hurt
[4:44:02] <Papafleish> the snap seed makes the mirage people die
[4:44:05] <gryffinp> It never occured to me to try to just fucking goomba the shadow kids
[4:44:07] <xeros720> Snap seeds will clear those dudes out for ya
[4:44:10] <+theshinyhunterdom> SUCCiro: Grandma Dies Twice
[4:44:11] <%GraceTBM> When Butterfly wins she twirls summon spirit on her finger
[4:44:14] <Darthwaffler> Does anyone know if this game is going to continue the Fromsoft trend of DLC = true ending?
[4:44:20] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Snap seed woolz!
[4:44:20] <@akuda_bar> speedy granny
[4:44:26] <Kghaleon> Does Snap seed remove them from the entire fight
[4:44:26] <gryffinp> That was a low
[4:44:29] <Heartless_01> sweep
[4:44:30] <BusterRepukken> The light butterflies kind of ruin this fight for me IMO
[4:44:35] <NeroInfinite> Yep
[4:44:36] <xeros720> she can resummon them later
[4:44:41] <+hax_metatron> FUCKING DO ITTTTT
[4:44:43] <%serranobros> don't waste snap seeds yet. get used to the fight first
[4:44:45] <%robobeau> @woolieversus The ghosts you don't kill end up being projectiles she throws at you
[4:44:46] <%GraceTBM> I was thinking I might as well wait to get this until all the DLC comes out so that I can do it all in one run
[4:44:47] <@akuda_bar> i love that there's a button you press in order to die
[4:44:50] <samuraijakanddaxter> get in her ass
[4:45:00] <+MegaMillenniumX> you. an party, but it was also a sweep
[4:45:00] <mccf> when the sword starts shaking i can be sure woolie is too
[4:45:04] <+TheoShodi> And she cooks a mean soba...
[4:45:04] <+hax_metatron> Don’t need snap seeds for this. Those illusions are one hit kills and you can dodge the follow
[4:45:05] <CuttleCrow> I wasted my snap seed immediately like an idiot LUL
[4:45:06] <%TheOneUpWarrior> im out of snap seeds need a seed dealer lol
[4:45:12] <Heartless_01> nice
[4:45:12] <LordGroomp> woolies mashing l1 like potatoes lul
[4:45:14] <BusterRepukken> Those things are total bullshit IMO
[4:45:15] <+TheoTTree> Gotta keep the pressure on or you lose posture progress
[4:45:16] <+theshinyhunterdom> Pupper Woolie
[4:45:17] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus trow the stars at her when she's on the string
[4:45:20] <LTKonnor> M A D A M A D A
[4:45:21] <f4ntom98> !uptime
[4:45:21] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 45 minutes
[4:45:22] <OkamiDude15> so when do we fight vergil?
[4:45:24] <%CrazySMT417> yes
[4:45:25] <+damnitmcgarnicle> stars are stronger when enemies are in the air
[4:45:27] <+EySoyCoco> insist on dash+r1
[4:45:28] <Limes528> yup
[4:45:30] <TrashLeviathan> shurikens will knock her off the wires
[4:45:30] <Ristwach> Yep
[4:45:30] <+hax_metatron> This fight is just dance. RIGHT NEXT TO HER
[4:45:31] <Papafleish> I'm so excited for the monkey
[4:45:31] <Zayasu> spend your exp points before you lose them
[4:45:31] <RoboXGP> jedi mind tricks
[4:45:32] <+sleepy_pink> it might do something else too
[4:45:33] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus it can knock her down if she's in the middle of something
[4:45:36] <+ccwettr123> @WoolieVersus just fyi the illusion bois count as enemy kills for your second res
[4:45:36] <+hax_metatron> PUPPY
[4:45:38] <alexandrecau> only nearby illusions
[4:45:38] <%robobeau> She's such a fun fight
[4:45:38] <$SilverRoddo> You were still just a puppy. FrankerZ FrankerZ
[4:45:41] <+hax_metatron> YOURE JUST A PUPPY
[4:45:44] <Ks201> yeah snap seed deletes then
[4:45:44] <laguerrilha> doesnt seem worthy using
[4:45:48] <%robobeau> Snap Seed is an AOE
[4:45:53] <+TheoShodi> LUL
[4:45:55] <Spagheddies> @TheoTTree Not necessarily. Posture drops slower the lower the boss's health. At full health it takes an instant to drop.
[4:45:56] <Darthwaffler> borf borf
[4:45:56] <%serranobros> yes but you can just avoid the projectiles by blocking them with the pillars
[4:45:56] <$ofloofy> Hes in his gut xD
[4:45:58] <+EySoyCoco> that was unsettling
[4:45:59] <+theshinyhunterdom> OhMyDog OhMyDog
[4:45:59] <+hax_metatron> Don’t need snap seeds
[4:46:01] <OkamiDude15> OhMyDog
[4:46:02] <+MegaMillenniumX> The only thing you can't parry are grabs.
[4:46:03] <RoboXGP> they're senpai men
[4:46:04] <+0oki> Is wool or playing on ps4?
[4:46:09] <Ristwach> Yes
[4:46:17] <+0oki> Cool
[4:46:20] <Ks201> pressure also stops posture from recovering
[4:46:22] <DashXero> He should be able to parry that, right?
[4:46:24] <Zayasu> is he not losing exp by dying to her?
[4:46:31] <CuttleCrow> shurikens are anti-air, which you can find out if you jump too
[4:46:32] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:46:44] <gryffinp> Man, is it even worth it to shuriken her out of the air when you could just dodge and counterstrike?
[4:46:48] <%CrazySMT417> when she goes away before the second phase hide under the statue and get a hit in when she returns
[4:47:02] <+peanutsondabeach2005> @gryffinp shurikening her out of the air does big posture damage
[4:47:03] <CuttleCrow> shuriken when she is about to grab you is amazing
[4:47:05] <+ccwettr123> @reiju_22 you only lose exp down to your last 'whole' point
[4:47:14] <Limes528> @reiju_22 He looses half of his money and half of his progress to the next skill point. It's not as bad as it sounds
[4:47:15] <Parapattern> Did you have sex with my Aunt May, Dr. Octopus?
[4:47:22] <LordGroomp> woolie and i having the same reaction to LB makes me happy
[4:47:25] <laguerrilha> with the amounts of deaths to her, when Woolie comes back to the present everyone will be skeletons
[4:47:25] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> what a badass baba
[4:47:30] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Just depends on the player. I've seen someone beat her with no items
[4:47:31] <Zayasu> oh ok thanks
[4:47:37] <7c_nickel> I love the fact that she parries with her feet and absorbs the impact by spinning
[4:47:45] <+theshinyhunterdom> GO BABUSHKAAA
[4:48:08] <CuttleCrow> i used shurkiens only against grabs since I sucked at evading them
[4:48:11] <Darthwaffler> choppa choppa da grandma!
[4:48:14] <+TheoShodi> Obasan !
[4:48:31] <samuraijakanddaxter> unlucky
[4:48:36] <+hoenhime344> almost!!!
[4:48:37] <+EySoyCoco> yeyeye
[4:48:38] <%CrazySMT417> so close
[4:48:38] <+TheoShodi> Almost there
[4:48:39] <ScreamLord> Mada Mada
[4:48:40] <Heartless_01> you got this
[4:48:42] <bigDEEforya> your just a puppy
[4:48:43] <+theshinyhunterdom> OhMyDog Only a pupper
[4:48:43] <Limes528> This boss really teaches you to be aggressive
[4:48:43] <laguerrilha> this boss is probably the wall preventing advancement from players that dont learn the mechanics
[4:48:43] <SixthSun2> Got grandma's number
[4:48:43] <+ccwettr123> @WoolieVersus is Sekiro a character action game?
[4:48:51] <gryffinp> I mean, he was almost to the first, weaker half, with no revives or heals left
[4:48:52] <+seriousink> woolie is downloading
[4:48:54] <Byronic_dreamer> So close
[4:48:55] <$SilverRoddo> This battle makes me wish for a From Software engine / mechanics version of Bayonetta? Just make the angels more difficult.
[4:48:56] <%CrazySMT417> I BELIEVE
[4:48:59] <Byronic_dreamer> Good job man
[4:49:02] <Byronic_dreamer> You got it
[4:49:03] <samuraijakanddaxter> lets get it
[4:49:04] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 no. its not really like DMC
[4:49:04] <+hax_metatron> SHE TEACHES YOU THE GAME PUPPY
[4:49:16] <$SilverRoddo> RalpherZ RalpherZ Mortis
[4:49:18] <+theshinyhunterdom> One day woolie will be a big woofer
[4:49:32] <Darthwaffler> Practice is over. Time for the fist try.
[4:49:32] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> how far in is woolie?
[4:49:33] <TheValiantBob> how far in the game is Woolie?
[4:49:39] <+天使42199> still pretty early
[4:49:44] <+hax_metatron> Second boss
[4:49:45] <+TheoShodi> When Sekiro grows up he whants to be like obasan
[4:50:12] <%queenquagenary> If you can avoid her in game for an hour she dies of old age, right
[4:50:16] <+ccwettr123> @天使42199 was kind of a joke lol, but still, its actually a lot like dmc. Instead of blorbs you have prayer beads, instead of rorbs you have skill points. You unlock moves, and do wacky and cool combat encounters
[4:50:20] <Acharky> He looks friggen determined. Having played the game I know why.
[4:50:23] <%robobeau> The Nightjar Slash would be super useful here
[4:50:38] <%tank7013> @TheValiantBob This is his second major boss
[4:51:00] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 yeah but the combat isn't focused on combos and no stylish meter either
[4:51:03] <gryffinp> How close is he to, ah, the second major boss in the main zone?
[4:51:08] <TheValiantBob> @tank7013 thanks, I've been watching random streams all at random parts of the game so I have no idea when what happens lol
[4:51:14] <Limes528> Sick
[4:51:14] <samuraijakanddaxter> fuckin niceee
[4:51:14] <TurtleButter> S I C K
[4:51:14] <+EySoyCoco> goood shit
[4:51:19] <Someguy893> nice
[4:51:21] <mccf> holy shit PogChamp PogChamp
[4:51:22] <%Nomad_Scholar> @WoolieVersus is there a type of fighting stick you would suggest to newbies?
[4:51:23] <samuraijakanddaxter> wooow
[4:51:23] <xeros720> that was really cool
[4:51:25] <steelmorrigan> Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice
[4:51:27] <samuraijakanddaxter> MLG
[4:51:28] <+天使42199> SMOKIN SEXY STYLE
[4:51:28] <%robobeau> Has Woolie seen the bull yet...?
[4:51:29] <+TheoShodi> NOOO GRANNY !
[4:51:33] <@akuda_bar> PogChamp
[4:51:36] <bigDEEforya> bikini BOTTOMS !!!!
[4:51:39] <Dragon_Batman> granny get down here
[4:51:44] <Byronic_dreamer> Mid air deflections are so sexy
[4:51:47] <+theshinyhunterdom> Abuelita D:
[4:51:48] <+ccwettr123> @天使42199 true, but same can be said for God of War 2018, which I think most people would agree is character action
[4:51:56] <@Menitta> wOW
[4:52:04] <Ks201> if you havnt seen it she shows up on the staru
[4:52:08] <Ks201> statue
[4:52:10] <+EySoyCoco> the music is just perfect
[4:52:14] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 This is not character action
[4:52:38] <xeros720> woolie eating those magic missles
[4:52:39] <%GraceTBM> @Nomad_Scholar I believe he might have covered that in his Arcade Sticks 101 video
[4:52:46] <%Nomad_Scholar> okay
[4:52:46] <Darthwaffler> I'm gettin' some Sister Friede vibes now.
[4:52:47] <%tank7013> @TheValiantBob Hah, that'll do it
[4:52:47] <TurtleButter> @ccwettr123 LUL
[4:52:48] <%Nomad_Scholar> thank you
[4:52:57] <+hoenhime344> Are you daft!?!?? lol this is the peak of character action
[4:53:00] <%Nomad_Scholar> I cannot see you name...
[4:53:02] <+ccwettr123> @天使42199 I mean, Sekiro is basically just Japanese Nero with an even bigger stick up his butt
[4:53:20] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 yeah in character design, sure.
[4:53:22] <+EySoyCoco> she deflected the shuriken fuuuuck
[4:53:23] <Limes528> Nice reflexes
[4:53:28] <%tank7013> @TheValiantBob Probably doesn't help that the game's structure is a little loose. If he wanted to he could go somewhere else instead of fighting this boos
[4:53:34] <gryffinp> It's not over yet
[4:53:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:53:35] <OozieStream> spellz
[4:53:37] <%tank7013> @TheValiantBob boss*
[4:53:38] <+hoenhime344> who deflects shgurikin...honestly!
[4:53:42] <TurtleButter> @ccwettr123 weird hill to die on, dude
[4:54:00] <+ccwettr123> @TurtleButter not trying to die on it, its just an interesting conversation
[4:54:20] <+hoenhime344> woolie is doing FAR better than 99% of streams.
[4:54:23] <+天使42199> idk I've been playing this and it feels NOTHING like dmc/bayonetta kinda games
[4:54:32] <gryffinp> Ok now it's over
[4:54:32] <+天使42199> its very much Tenchu Soulsy
[4:54:36] <samuraijakanddaxter> thats super fuckin unlicky
[4:54:36] <+hoenhime344> because its not?
[4:54:39] <TurtleButter> Cause it ain't like them, at all.
[4:54:39] <f4ntom98> !uptime
[4:54:39] <+ALTRNico> MADA MADA
[4:54:40] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 54 minutes
[4:54:41] <+theshinyhunterdom> Only a OhMyDog
[4:54:43] <%tank7013> That was a great run though
[4:54:44] <+EySoyCoco> those air deflects dude
[4:54:45] <LTKonnor> M A D A M A D A
[4:54:46] <Darthwaffler> borf
[4:54:47] <KillMyPast> It reminds me of Ninja Gaiden a little
[4:54:49] <Byronic_dreamer> Hop your way to victory
[4:54:52] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Pretty good early efforts
[4:54:54] <%serranobros> you cant buy more snapseeds
[4:54:55] <%robobeau> SO CLOSE
[4:54:55] <DrStinkers> Lady butterfly's tracking magic blobs seem a bit similar to moonlight butterfly
[4:54:56] <+天使42199> @hoenhime344 Yeah I know its not, some guy was saying it was kinda like dmc
[4:54:56] <Varanoo> Maybe buy some healing items?
[4:54:58] <%RayDaug> of course Woolie would be crushing the Royal Guard fight while everyone else struggles
[4:55:01] <+ALTRNico> then don't fail
[4:55:03] <$SilverRoddo> !sr Lose Yourself - Em
[4:55:05] <%CrazySMT417> I'd come back laer
[4:55:06] <keyworthe> you dont need the snap seeds
[4:55:08] <%CrazySMT417> later
[4:55:09] <RoboXGP> he had maybe two more charges
[4:55:15] <Someguy893> yeah, come back with more stuff
[4:55:15] <KillMyPast> Snap seeds arent really necessary tbh
[4:55:15] <NeonBleu> you dont need the snap
[4:55:17] <kaeltxwz> @WoolieVersus you can just shiriken the illusions, they give ammo back
[4:55:17] <+ccwettr123> @天使42199 I mean, its definitely a lot slower than classic character action, but it does have a lot of the traits, and you really cant call it an arpg anymore like souls or bb
[4:55:17] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus if ya run outta seeds run around like an asshole till they disappear
[4:55:20] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> you are just a puppy - so it was written
[4:55:27] <DashXero> You can hide behind a pillar to mitigate the most dangerous thing the illusions can do.
[4:55:29] <+gael_j> This boss is definitely doable without them
[4:55:33] <samuraijakanddaxter> that moment before the first deathblow there was so sick lol woolie was sliding and parrying and shit
[4:55:35] <Darthwaffler> ! SEEDS BROKEN !
[4:55:40] <+EySoyCoco> go to the secret area where the horse boss, there "is" a skill around there @WoolieVersus
[4:55:44] <Limes528> It's really tough to condition yourself to do this, but if you neutral jump her sweeps you can do that jump kick to hurt her posture
[4:55:47] <+hoenhime344> @WoolieVersus snap seed is nice, but not a necessity. once they turn into butterflys use the pillars.
[4:55:49] <Splatterfest> And so go the Days of Our Lives
[4:55:52] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 Yeah but there is no combos, which I think are very important to those kinda games.
[4:55:55] <+ALTRNico> you can just run around when she summons illusions
[4:56:01] <DashXero> You got this.
[4:56:10] <Zayasu> is it just 1 more? LUL
[4:56:15] <TurtleButter> This isn't a character action, plain and simple.
[4:56:20] <$Retrash> I used the feather prosthetic for this fight. Worked real well
[4:56:23] <+ccwettr123> @天使42199 but isnt posture kind of a combo/style meter just on an individual enemy level?
[4:56:24] <+天使42199> @TurtleButter I agree
[4:56:25] <+gael_j> And use pillars as cover
[4:56:32] <Limes528> They turn into projectiles, so you have to keep running
[4:56:32] <samuraijakanddaxter> youre getting pretty close too
[4:56:36] <Hamma526> You have 50 in storage woolie why did you buy one lol
[4:56:43] <+Verd_254> She's super weak to side dodge and slash, you can almost spam it. Barely one shot her doing this.
[4:56:45] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 no. posture is basically Poise from souls games but tweaked
[4:56:48] <RoboXGP> there's posture and hp, it's quicker to break posture than it is hp
[4:56:56] <+天使42199> its not a style meter
[4:56:57] <Limes528> Damn. Fuck phase 1
[4:56:58] <Splatterfest> I keep seeing your "its not a character action" but what else is it still and rpg? I dont think so
[4:57:02] <$SilverRoddo> She has a Divekick?!
[4:57:04] <TheValiantBob> just curious, how historically accurate is this game? I know it takes place in Feudal Japan, but obviously there's magic shenanigans so just curious if any of the characters are from Japanese lore or history
[4:57:10] <%tank7013> Goddamn that's a strat eh?
[4:57:12] <+TheoShodi> WOA ! Woolie is doing
[4:57:17] <DashXero> Seems like you've found an optimal attack rhythm.
[4:57:24] <TurtleButter> @Splatterfest it's a souls-like?
[4:57:34] <+hoenhime344> @WoolieVersus treat it as you would the Phalanx or Vort
[4:57:37] <+theshinyhunterdom> OhMyDog
[4:57:37] <mccf> big greed
[4:57:39] <DrStinkers> it was working
[4:57:39] <Splatterfest> i suppose thats a genre now
[4:57:40] <Hamma526> There was an Ashina clan in history but that’s basically it @thevaliantbob
[4:57:42] <+ALTRNico> T I L T E D
[4:57:45] <+Verd_254> side dodge and slash locks her up if you keep doing it
[4:57:46] <+hax_metatron> @thevaliantbob None.it just uses that template for character and action design
[4:57:46] <kaeltxwz> @WoolieVersus you can parry her counter kick
[4:57:47] <Darthwaffler> @TheValiantBob Sengoku era with no real historical figure or places.
[4:57:50] <+hoenhime344> @WoolieVersus its the same area
[4:57:53] <+EySoyCoco> almost there
[4:57:54] <Splatterfest> souls was an rpg to me though
[4:57:55] <%CrazySMT417> I BELIEVE!!!
[4:58:03] <+hax_metatron> FIGHTING GAMES
[4:58:04] <+seriousink> FGC woolie is here
[4:58:05] <TurtleButter> an odd genre, but yeah LUL
[4:58:07] <+theshinyhunterdom> The fire rises brotha
[4:58:12] <+TheoShodi> Steal her Pie Woolie!
[4:58:14] <%FrostedZaibatsu> If she parry just automatically+ block afterwards
[4:58:18] <+torontototoro> Fuuuuuudge both Pat and Woolz are streaming this. Picking between 2 game dads is the worst
[4:58:21] <+天使42199> this game has very light rpg elements. id still say its closer to souls then it is dmc/bayonetta
[4:58:24] <+ccwettr123> @天使42199 posture isn't really poise though, and its not stamina either. Its a wierd combo of a combo meter and a stamina system. You do actually have to combo, keeping up the pressure and blocks, or you lose it, unlike poise or stamina
[4:58:26] <alexandrecau> Woolie she has your number address and social id
[4:58:32] <Limes528> @Splatterfest You can just call it an action game. It just feels unique because it's a Fromsoft action game
[4:58:43] <+hoenhime344> your wrong...this game has alot of rpg elements, they are just farther into the game
[4:58:51] <Splatterfest> @Limes528 sure enough thats broad enough already
[4:58:53] <beatie_g> How goes the video game, fellow gamers.
[4:58:57] <Sarumarine> Are we genre fighting in here?
[4:59:00] <Mirakei> Lady Butterfly Maria
[4:59:05] <+hoenhime344> game is fast and exciting :p
[4:59:08] <%TaerisX> I think this fight was a lot easier than the fight with the drunk sub boss
[4:59:10] <Mirakei> BATTLE OF THE GENRES
[4:59:11] <TurtleButter> Not fighting, nah.
[4:59:24] <$SilverRoddo> Haiyai.
[4:59:25] <triklstyx> Still way less of an RPG tho
[4:59:25] <%tank7013> Nice
[4:59:25] <+EySoyCoco> halfway there
[4:59:28] <+MrMcCrabby> yeyeyeye
[4:59:30] <laguerrilha> good good
[4:59:31] <TurtleButter> GOIN' IN
[4:59:39] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 This game barely has combos, so I don't think its really fair to call it a combo meter
[4:59:44] <+天使42199> a stamina meter sure
[4:59:44] <Darthwaffler> @Mirakei Of the astral pit?
[4:59:46] <+TheoShodi> Cant wait for sekiro agdq speed run
[4:59:52] <beatie_g> Stun meter
[4:59:56] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:56] <+天使42199> yeah stun meter
[5:00:03] <+天使42199> stun meter is the best way to describe it
[5:00:04] <+hoenhime344> @triklstyx not really, once you obtain the multitude of prostectics the game is VERY deep
[5:00:08] <Mirakei> @Darthwaffler Of the best of the worst
[5:00:21] <%TaerisX> it is a posture meter. in order to fill the gauge you need to string together a text, otherwise known as combos, to break your opponents and do a death blow.
[5:00:23] <$SilverRoddo> “Shut her down before she can set up.” TShirt quote.
[5:00:36] <beatie_g> Thank you, chat robot. I forgot I was thirsty for a sec there
[5:00:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:00:40] <%TaerisX> speech-to-text is trash
[5:00:51] <+ccwettr123> very fair. I guess the big thing is that this game is just in a weird place between genres and I'm very interested in seeing where people place it and why
[5:00:52] <TurtleButter> OW
[5:00:54] <laguerrilha> yeah if you stop putting pressure she does illusion of projectiles
[5:00:57] <Darthwaffler> The true Sekiro starts here!
[5:01:02] <laguerrilha> or*
[5:01:06] <SiegeJay> Grandma Butterfly!
[5:01:08] <+theshinyhunterdom> GET IT
[5:01:16] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 yeah its not quite DMC but its also a bit moved away from souls as well
[5:01:20] <+solzan2000> close
[5:01:22] <+wtaguy> does woolie want backseat gamer help?
[5:01:23] <DashXero> She's on the ropes. Play solid.
[5:01:25] <triklstyx> @hoenhime344 I still think heavy RPG elements late game qualifies something as an RPG necessarily, and depth has nothing to do with it
[5:01:26] <beatie_g> This is MAH swamp, grandma
[5:01:33] <triklstyx> *don't
[5:01:34] <LordGroomp> i’d let her be my grandma, if you see what i’m saying
[5:01:37] <%FrostedZaibatsu> On the third hit of anything she's going to parry
[5:01:41] <$Bruh_itsTC> god damn this game is pretty
[5:01:43] <Splatterfest> @beatie_g lol
[5:01:45] <+torontototoro> I love the music in From's games Kreygasm
[5:01:46] <+EySoyCoco> enemie step PogChamp
[5:01:47] <TurtleButter> woah that flip
[5:01:50] <%TaerisX> *attacks
[5:01:57] <+EySoyCoco> *enemy
[5:02:02] <$SilverRoddo> Don’t let her youthful voice fool you.
[5:02:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> How does it feel to fight Grandma, woolie?
[5:02:12] <TurtleButter> ouch
[5:02:12] <+Adriangabs> very close
[5:02:13] <+solzan2000> FailFish
[5:02:14] <+torontototoro> sleep tight pupper
[5:02:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[5:02:14] <7c_nickel> flying axe kick
[5:02:14] <Heartless_01> lol
[5:02:15] <+天使42199> damn
[5:02:15] <LordGroomp> DO OR DIE
[5:02:15] <+theshinyhunterdom> OhMyDog
[5:02:17] <CuttleCrow> *internal screaming*
[5:02:22] <%TaerisX> How's the game run for people? Mine is a smoth 60fps but it chugs
[5:02:23] <$Bruh_itsTC> NotLikeThis
[5:02:23] <+MrMcCrabby> mada mada
[5:02:24] <DrStinkers> The pilliars might help with the magic juice
[5:02:24] <Darthwaffler> mada mada
[5:02:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Man this fight took me 30 tries
[5:02:25] <kaeltxwz> Almost there! you can do eet
[5:02:26] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @samuraijakanddaxter
[5:02:27] <+Verd_254> side step slash is good here
[5:02:27] <ScreamLord> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[5:02:27] <seylumiue> So damn close
[5:02:29] <+hoenhime344> @triklstyx i have NO idea what you said but its ok lolol lets enjoy the game
[5:02:29] <%queenquagenary> Woolie, work past your limiters. It's okay to beat the shit out of that old lady.
[5:02:31] <Varanoo> Go do horse boy stuff instead
[5:02:31] <Heartless_01> ganbatte!
[5:02:34] <Mirakei> Grandma Swamp saw woolie grow up. She has his number
[5:02:34] <DaniReDux> Hang in there Woolie
[5:02:38] <+TheoShodi> Trow her in the woolie hole
[5:02:38] <+wtaguy> what's his attack at?
[5:02:41] <beatie_g> Was that a copypasta
[5:02:44] <+fatal_penguin_> Woolie you need to hit her so hard that her Life Alert breaks
[5:02:45] <+Das_Prints> You got close. This took Max about an hour or so to do.
[5:02:47] <+torontototoro> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[5:02:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Grandma aint nothin to fuck with
[5:02:48] <+hax_metatron> Channel Guy Sensei
[5:02:51] <+theshinyhunterdom> doodBenny doodBenny
[5:02:52] <+MisterAngryEyes112> IT ONLY GETS HARDER
[5:02:54] <+hax_metatron> Take off your straps
[5:02:56] <+ccwettr123> @WoolieVersus keep up that willpower man, it only gets harder from here
[5:03:04] <Varanoo> Old version of maria from bloodbourne
[5:03:15] <$SilverRoddo> Surpass: yourself!
[5:03:19] <+torontototoro> Granny better drop some tasty Werthers Originals when you finally beat her
[5:03:22] <Mirakei> Yeah this fight is very Lady Maria like
[5:03:26] <+solzan2000> lol
[5:03:34] <+theshinyhunterdom> Fan Art incoming for real
[5:03:44] <+MisterAngryEyes112> ooop some clipping there
[5:03:45] <LordGroomp> keep up that pma woolie it’ll do you good
[5:03:47] <+hax_metatron> Does Woolie have nightjar slash????
[5:03:54] <+hax_metatron> That unlocks this fight
[5:03:54] <$SilverRoddo> Ignore her stands?
[5:04:05] <CuttleCrow> she's giving you the hot butter ice cream
[5:04:10] <+Verd_254> see, that side step slash hits every time
[5:04:21] <+fatal_penguin_> Watch out for her Walker Special Woolie
[5:04:34] <triklstyx> Just that DS is explicitly an RPG from the rip, which isn't the same as having heavy RPG elements late game. Not that either is better or worse, just remarkably different
[5:04:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i find that dodging left is the most effective
[5:04:44] <DashXero> Don't give up yet. You can still pull this off.
[5:04:48] <+Fenrein> Your backdashes are sick though for the most part
[5:04:48] <Darthwaffler> ! CONCENTRATION AT RISK !
[5:04:49] <+hax_metatron> NIGHTJAR SLASH
[5:04:51] <+torontototoro> final form she'll ascend to the heavens on an Acorn stairlift
[5:04:51] <+theshinyhunterdom> Puppys Die Twice
[5:04:52] <+hoenhime344> i mean, this is the most From Stofware boss ever, 6 pillars, rectangle,. 2 phases. focuses on basic gameplay elements such as parry and consumable use
[5:04:54] <+Fenrein> so you got that
[5:04:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its not a surefire strat but it works a lot
[5:05:01] <+ccwettr123> anyone know what bosses (including stuff like ogre and bull) Woolie's beaten?
[5:05:11] <Varanoo> Bad run
[5:05:17] <+天使42199> hes beaten horse guy hes beaten orge
[5:05:17] <$SilverRoddo> That jumping slash upon wake-up from death.
[5:05:17] <+theshinyhunterdom> doodBenny doodBenny doodBenny
[5:05:24] <+theshinyhunterdom> mada mada
[5:05:25] <uncledoodsauce> @woolieversus the dora the explorer movie is real
[5:05:25] <+天使42199> hes beaten fat drunk guy
[5:05:25] <Splatterfest> can you GET HUGE in this?
[5:05:26] <laguerrilha> This boss so far seems fair. It makes you learn the mechanics and be aggressive
[5:05:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You gotta Yomi, Woolie
[5:05:31] <+ccwettr123> @天使42199 thanks my man
[5:05:33] <+hax_metatron> Try Nightjar Slash
[5:05:39] <+天使42199> @ccwettr123 np
[5:05:40] <+fatal_penguin_> Beat her so hard that her Social Security runs out
[5:05:47] <+hoenhime344> lol
[5:05:50] <%TaerisX> A trick that worked for me is to hit her three times to force her to step back or kick me, which I deflected and forced her to keep doing as much as possible
[5:05:56] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Help me out, I cant even beat the Drunk guy in the Flashback.
[5:06:22] <%TaerisX> @KitsuneManami do you best to keep the ally alive. I would focus on the adds and kill them as fast as possible.
[5:06:24] <%linkwolf4> her immune systems weak, give her a case of the Flu!
[5:06:26] <+peanutsondabeach2005> what legendarylinks said. 9 times out of 10 she will do a kick right after you hit her three times
[5:06:35] <+peanutsondabeach2005> which can be really easily deflected
[5:06:37] <%TaerisX> The ally can interrupt him
[5:06:42] <KitsuneManami> @LegendaryLinks4391 he dies near instantly
[5:06:48] <+天使42199> you really gotta get that jump timing down for that sweep attack
[5:06:54] <ScreamLord> But sometimes dodge
[5:07:00] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Set the clock forward a year, she dies LUL
[5:07:01] <%Nomad_Scholar> Woolie: Motivated
[5:07:04] <%TaerisX> Kill any adds targeting him and all other adds ASAP. I was able to keep my guy alive up to the last hit
[5:07:06] <+天使42199> you can jump on her when she does the sweep attack
[5:07:15] <CuttleCrow> I just peeked at Pat's stream, he's using english voiceovers DansGame
[5:07:18] <haitakaa> seduce her Woolie
[5:07:18] <%TaerisX> I used the Axe to interrupt the boss
[5:07:30] <laguerrilha> Chat if you chose die instead of resurrect, does the npcs still get dragon aids?
[5:07:35] <%TaerisX> your ally tends to use moves that interrupt. At least in my game he did
[5:07:38] <SiegeJay> Almost there
[5:07:38] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[5:07:40] <+torontototoro> @CuttleCrow apatFist
[5:07:43] <SiegeJay> Almost got her staggared
[5:07:45] <+ccwettr123> sorry for being an asky boi, but what combat art does our boy have on?
[5:07:47] <%TaerisX> YOU CAN DO THIS WOOLY
[5:07:49] <$SilverRoddo> Allow her to hit you, don’t let her psyche you out.
[5:07:50] <xeros720> could smell that greed
[5:07:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SiegeJay
[5:07:53] <%TaerisX> WOOLIE*
[5:07:57] <Buteman> @laguerrilha yes, it's just the number of times you die
[5:07:58] <+Verd_254> I bet the only reason the game even has English as an option is because Activision.
[5:08:05] <SiegeJay> Yeyeyyeye
[5:08:12] <Limes528> @KitsuneManami Really? He was an unstoppable badass in my game. I focused on the archers first, then shield guys, then normal dudes. The boss isn't too dificult to dodge while doing this
[5:08:19] <+peanutsondabeach2005> @KitsuneManami i honestly think the best way to fight that boss is to memorize the attacks. i know its obvious but he only has a few combos
[5:08:19] <%tdclms> tdclms subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[5:08:20] <+Das_Prints> The music transition into this phase is really good.
[5:08:22] <ScreamLord> Snap Seed?
[5:08:27] <%tdclms> Have my power woolie
[5:08:36] <%queenquagenary> *runs in a circle* "You're surprisingly skilled...."
[5:08:43] <TrashLeviathan> @Verd_254 most from soft ganes are in english
[5:08:44] <+torontototoro> PUPPER, son of Owl. House of hoots and woofs
[5:08:45] <+ccwettr123> @ScreamingMeat he's big empty
[5:08:45] <DashXero> That's peculiar.
[5:08:48] <%TaerisX> @Limes528 He's hard to dodge for me. Some moves after the first deathblow he would fake and then grab me. Infuriating lol
[5:08:54] <+天使42199> @Limes528 yeah you can keep him alive if you jump in there when he does and chop up the mobs instantly which is ez to do
[5:08:57] <KitsuneManami> @peanutsondabeach2005 my issue is getting back to him after losing
[5:08:59] <mccf> the ancient joestar techinque
[5:09:04] <alexandrecau> @ScreamingMeat not worth it, there are only three left and if he dies he lose them forever
[5:09:04] <marcelmonke> the snap seeds are limited, he doesn't want to waste them
[5:09:06] <KitsuneManami> sick of fighting his turds and then him
[5:09:07] <+CharminglyMelancholic> @leviathan666303 was going to say same thing lol
[5:09:14] <+Verd_254> @leviathan666303 DS was in English in all regions due to the setting, From probably wanted this to be in Japanese in all regions too hence why its default.
[5:09:18] <samuraijakanddaxter> get inside her asshole bro
[5:09:21] <tag545> might be to unlock a revive
[5:09:30] <SiegeJay> How to make a Dark Souls 2 Boss fight? Add ADDs
[5:09:31] <+EySoyCoco> killing aparitions refill your resurrection?
[5:09:36] <SleepyMaribo> She is for real!
[5:09:37] <+peanutsondabeach2005> @KitsuneManami yeah the mooks before him are a pain lmao. have you fought any other bosses/minibosses
[5:09:44] <%TaerisX> Yeah it aids your res guage
[5:09:47] <%TaerisX> gauge*
[5:09:49] <beatie_g> This music makes me feels like I’m witnessing a tragedy
[5:09:50] <KitsuneManami> @peanutsondabeach2005 No
[5:10:02] <haitakaa> if only John Sekiro had an Orbital Frame
[5:10:04] <+DeaconBluesClues> are shuken a limited resource
[5:10:15] <%TaerisX> Did anyone else find that snapping seed to be absolutely worthless
[5:10:17] <haitakaa> mada mada
[5:10:22] <Darthwaffler> Kick her wrinkly ass Woolz!
[5:10:27] <+theshinyhunterdom> doodBenny
[5:10:29] <steelmorrigan> would i be worth grinidn some more tech and coming back?

[5:10:32] <$ofloofy> FrankerZ
[5:10:32] <+djbsully> This fight is ALL about breaking her posture._. You can kill her at half a healthbar if done right DEFLECT EVERYTHING, jump her paralous sweeps and side dodge her falling knee...She'll die off a deflection.POSTURE POSTURE POSTURE
[5:10:33] <samuraijakanddaxter> get in them gutssss
[5:10:35] <+CharminglyMelancholic> @legendarylinks4391 I haven’t used it
[5:10:36] <Buteman> @WoolieVersus If you don't have the posture break buff skills, they help tremendously in this fight
[5:10:39] <+peanutsondabeach2005> @KitsuneManami i guess my advice then would be to go explore other areas before finishing the flashback the powerups you get from memories and prayer beads are no joke
[5:10:49] <%linkwolf4> just pop your DT woo- oh wait wrong game
[5:10:55] <+skylerpilot> @DeaconBluesClues the resource in the bottom right that says 16
[5:11:00] <Darthwaffler> Break her spirit!
[5:11:01] <danknugglit> !Motivated
[5:11:01] <@Moobot> 287 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:11:04] <%TaerisX> @djbsully Yup that's how I got her. I spent an hour learning her moves and their timing
[5:11:06] <+torontototoro> This room reminds me of where you fight Friede in DS3
[5:11:07] <haitakaa> Woolie you're slouching a little, sit up straight and fix that posture my ninja
[5:11:08] <kaeltxwz> gotta go HARD on that old lady@
[5:11:10] <CuttleCrow> !Motivated
[5:11:11] <beatie_g> Jude wake up DP
[5:11:22] <+skylerpilot> @DeaconBluesClues some shinobi arts L1 R1 comob use them and all your ninja tools use them
[5:11:32] <%deadredeyez> deadredeyez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! can i say this game is like dark souls?
[5:11:53] <+Ralyks9117> you got dis
[5:11:55] <%TaerisX> @eeyoreoftwitch apparently, if you use a snapping seed during her illusions, it's supposed to break them (make them go away). That's what the dying warrior said. I used it during this phase and nothing happened
[5:11:57] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @deadredeyez not combat wise
[5:12:12] <$ofloofy> mildly dark souls like but the gameplays really different
[5:12:24] <%TaerisX> And I'm glad it feels so different
[5:12:28] <$ofloofy> ^
[5:12:31] <$ofloofy> its soo good
[5:12:33] <LordGroomp> one of the keys of combat in this game is learning that enemies retaliate after they deflect you w few times. if you learn the deflect timing for that, you’re golden
[5:12:40] <%TaerisX> It's a nice mix of Bloodborne (mostly bloodborne) and DS
[5:12:43] <$KnivesEve> this phase 1 or 2
[5:12:50] <blackseraphx> so close
[5:12:51] <Dawnchaser_Twitch> Without spoilers, how far in the game is this?
[5:12:52] <%deadredeyez> @that_marcus_dude tru
[5:12:54] <%TaerisX> Phase 1 Knives
[5:12:56] <%queenquagenary> food break
[5:12:58] <+gael_j> Woolie your hard offense is causing you to trade hits too much
[5:12:59] <Mirakei> does it also have elements of Nioh?
[5:13:00] <+MisterAngryEyes112> This is such a game of INCHES
[5:13:01] <beatie_g> This is the first boss
[5:13:05] <$ofloofy> @LegendaryLinks4391 definitely with cool ass ninja parkour
[5:13:06] <CuttleCrow> definitely getting a lot of bloodborne vibes
[5:13:09] <samuraijakanddaxter> GET IN THEM GUTSSSSS
[5:13:09] <KillMyPast> What worked for me was being super aggressive and parrying after she parries you
[5:13:14] <%FadingFrost> FadingFrost subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[5:13:15] <+ccwettr123> @WoolieVersus other paths remain open for you. Perhaps further adventuring may be profitable?
[5:13:17] <+CharminglyMelancholic> @legendarylinks4391 I brute forced my way in game beaten all mini bosses and Juzou unlocked idol near butterfly I haven’t fought her yet wondering if u should fight her or horse guy yet
[5:13:19] <Limes528> Get well soon
[5:13:24] <danknugglit> Dont be so agressive watch her patterns
[5:13:27] <LordGroomp> ROT OH NO

[5:13:33] <%TaerisX> @ofloofy Hell yeah. I love this game but HOT DAMN does it make me angry sometimes. I love it
[5:13:39] <+EySoyCoco> there is a godlike skill for this fight, you could unlock that
[5:13:41] <blackseraphx> by the time we're done everyone will be sick
[5:13:44] <+天使42199> you died too much and now they got dragon aids
[5:13:50] <KitsuneManami> It's NOT Dark Souls, this game is harder x10
[5:13:51] <haitakaa> Dark Socks
[5:13:54] <+djbsully> Read mine plz scroll up
[5:13:58] <+JustToWatch> this game is so much harder than dark souls
[5:14:02] <Dragon_Batman> You could save it for next time
[5:14:06] <laguerrilha> @danknugglit if he doesnt push in she throws projectiles. This boss you need to get in
[5:14:07] <aizt> what are the odds i come in to see you fighting the boss that made me rage quit for the night
[5:14:08] <%TaerisX> @JustToWatch Absolutely
[5:14:08] <haitakaa> sit up straight Woolington
[5:14:11] <NeroInfinite> Time to call it and go eat

[5:14:58] <LordGroomp> ONE MORE ONCE
[5:15:00] <majindusto> ONCE MORE!
[5:15:03] <DSD24> You need power?
[5:15:07] <samuraijakanddaxter> one shot
[5:15:09] <danknugglit> No disrespek
[5:15:09] <JanusII> You just need to stop and come back fresh on this one I think.
[5:15:11] <samuraijakanddaxter> one opportunity
[5:15:14] <+peanutsondabeach2005> people dont joke around when they say this is "parry: the video game"
[5:15:16] <Djinnazz> How about a talking filling, refreshing, Redbull.
[5:15:21] <%TaerisX> @WoolieVersus you could try forcing her to use certain moves. Every third time she blocks, she will either kick you or jump back. You can time it right to deflect the kick and then attack again. It becomes a pattern of laying down the offense, and then deflecting the kick.
[5:15:28] <$SilverRoddo> Fuel, fire, desire.
[5:15:38] <LordGroomp> dmc royalguarding trained me for this game
[5:15:45] <%TaerisX> I was able to DESTROY her on her second phase this way
[5:16:02] <Dawnchaser_Twitch> If you want to get the best out of eating, don't think about anything else. Not even this fight. It's like meditation. People tend to forget that eating should be a restful time.
[5:16:07] <KillMyPast> Focus on getting her posture down instead of her health
[5:16:10] <+peanutsondabeach2005> the dash attack after the two kunai throws are pretty easy to deflect too
[5:16:19] <+djbsully> Dodge paralous sweeps and the knee deflect everything else,EVEN NEEDLES
[5:16:36] <Animedingo> I can't wait for TFS to have to fight grandma
[5:16:40] <haitakaa> for a guy who loves parrying Woolie isn't parrying nearly enough
[5:16:40] <%TaerisX> I feel like a bad ass when i deflect her needles lol
[5:16:44] <danknugglit> You can also cheese this boss hard by running and using running attacks
[5:17:17] <$SilverRoddo> Do it for your Lord, Wolf.
[5:17:17] <+DeaconBluesClues> I'm just imagiing pat drinking a red bull in a second like its an estus
[5:17:20] <+peanutsondabeach2005> oh wow nice throw
[5:17:38] <+fatal_penguin_> You did it
[5:17:53] <blowntheguy> yes dude

[5:18:36] <LordGroomp> joestar family secret technique
[5:18:50] <samuraijakanddaxter> the tracking attacks in this game look like some bullshit
[5:18:59] <KitsuneManami> This game looks Needlessly difficuylt
[5:19:13] <KitsuneManami> try hard difficult
[5:19:13] <$ofloofy> @LordGroomp the most effective of techniques
[5:19:14] <haitakaa> gettin turnt ujp
[5:19:18] <NeroInfinite> That was a good go.
[5:19:20] <seylumiue> You ARE close
[5:19:21] <CuttleCrow> tracking sweeps are hot BS
[5:19:22] <danknugglit> Good try

[5:20:32] <samuraijakanddaxter> theres a stage where your game being "difficult" actually crosses into it being bullshit lol watching woolie's first stream of this there was a moment with the red eyed ogre boss where it literally spun and done a 180 in the middle of its gravving animation to get him
[5:20:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Grandma will die of old age
