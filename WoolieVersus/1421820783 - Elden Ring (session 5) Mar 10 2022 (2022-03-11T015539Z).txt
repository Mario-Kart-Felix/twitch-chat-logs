[0:03:23] <%crybirb> Wai Woolie using glasses? What is this?
[0:03:23] <@Solidus_113> see through the fog of the TV realm
[0:03:31] <quindolin> PUT THEM BACK ON
[0:03:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> I like to think it's like that Spider-Man meme but reversed
[0:03:38] <RyuuAoi> Push them up, Woolie like a true anime protagonist!
[0:03:39] <%Prevot> they should've been like Kamiya and just gave everyone glasses with no excuses
[0:03:43] <%radiorosewater> GLASSES STAY ON
[0:03:44] <Afrosamasenpai> my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
[0:03:59] <Afrosamasenpai> WE CANT SEE
[0:03:59] <IzanagiNoOokami> I wear glasses and they made me strong,
[0:04:08] <mikesapartment> humans got bad eyes
[0:04:12] <+BananaSlammuh> Surely screens aren't the problem...
[0:04:14] <quindolin> my glasses make me superior
[0:04:16] <%crybirb> People would just push it through, tbh, most people refused to use glasses.
[0:04:17] <+Your_heals> So 1/5
[0:04:18] <%Prevot> prob just more people actually going to the eye doctor
[0:04:20] <@Menitta> I might need to get glasses. I think staring at screens all day is hurting me
[0:04:20] <RyuuAoi> Oh yeah we all blind. Too much masterbate
[0:04:25] <haitakaa> maybe people just don't care for contact lenses anymore
[0:04:25] <+Jiggisnipe> yea a lot people need corrective lens
[0:04:31] <%hax_metatron> I got glasses in kindergarten bruh 😭
[0:04:37] <%youngking_kush> Haha I was always blind, yall so late
[0:04:39] <ShepherdShang> My school did eye tests and thats why I have glasses
[0:04:49] <%radiorosewater> screens are a motherfucker, glasses are more commercially available, contacts are impractical
[0:05:00] <leith_aziz> Hi pickyWave
[0:05:01] <DSD24> Eyes on the inside
[0:05:05] <haisho> in my case it's hereditary and my eyesight is real bad
[0:05:06] <@Solidus_113> I avoided as much as possible wearing glasses in middle school because I would get made fun of. certainly didn't help solve the eye problems years later
[0:05:09] <leith_aziz> Not sure how much I missed cohhNotes
[0:05:10] <%Reveresao> Because they are looking at those phones! woolieF /s
[0:05:14] <+RowenCleric> schools are a bit better at identifying it or testing kids
[0:05:15] <+casy_fair> parents care more about their kids now....Our parents didn't give a fuck about us lol
[0:05:16] <%crybirb> No, just people testing more and more knowledge in it. People aren't getting worse due to screens.
[0:05:19] <quindolin> I didnt get glasses until my early 20s and it was like stepping into a new, superior world
[0:05:29] <%youngking_kush> I always liked my glasses because Malcolm X
[0:05:32] <RyuuAoi> Screens up close all day. Can't be good
[0:05:33] <leith_aziz> I still wear my glasses pickyEZ
[0:05:35] <%holydeviant1> Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnerds
[0:05:36] <DSD24> Ah yeah nothing says nerd like bad eyesite
[0:05:40] <%hax_metatron> Well people with glasses get the best head. I did research.
[0:05:49] <leith_aziz> I know about lenses, but I hear they might be more tedious
[0:05:50] <%radiorosewater> YOOO
[0:05:50] <mikesapartment> ZAMN
[0:05:52] <Afrosamasenpai> 10/10
[0:05:52] <leith_aziz> Yooo
[0:05:54] <haitakaa> I don't think that's a real thing
[0:05:54] <%radiorosewater> THAT WORKS
[0:05:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> YO
[0:05:56] <Necnill> Fly
[0:05:56] <derap41> Yeah
[0:05:57] <+FlukeC> Yeah when I was a kid if your eyes were bad you just had to deal with it.
[0:05:57] <leith_aziz> doodOK
[0:05:58] <karawra> nice
[0:05:59] <%FugitiveJay> why does reggie look like funk master flex
[0:05:59] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:06:01] <%Majkir> There are issues that only start being noticeably if you focus your sight for increased lenghts of time. It makes sanse with more jobs involving screens.
[0:06:02] <%youngking_kush> ENHANCE
[0:06:04] <%kushgoku> Reggie with glasses looks Correct
[0:06:07] <%holydeviant1> R E G system!

[0:06:19] <%youngking_kush> Reggie is now Oracle
[0:06:20] <%Lion_kun> He looks like that one nerd from the IT crowd
[0:06:22] <owensleftfoot> THE GUY IN THE CHAIR
[0:06:23] <quindolin> looking like PM Dawn up in here
[0:06:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie "Ned" Gaston
[0:06:24] <%Prevot> Black Oracle
[0:06:25] <maskedmustelid> Maurice!
[0:06:27] <%crybirb> There is research saying that one cause  of a bunch of people from poor backgrounds dropping school was due having vision problems but lack of knowledge by the community and access to healthcare impossibilitate them to actually fix the problem.
[0:06:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:06:28] <RyuuAoi> Smart Brother ha
[0:06:29] <megaman_sentinel> yo Reggie I got those same frames
[0:06:29] <DSD24> Hackerman!
[0:06:31] <+Bin_VV> The time I figured out I needed glasses was when I put on my friend's glasses as a joke and I saw better
[0:06:32] <yukichocomilk> I'M IN
[0:06:35] <%youngking_kush> NO, Otakon
[0:06:39] <RyuuAoi> Reggie you wear it well!
[0:06:44] <+Your_heals> rooSpy
[0:06:53] <leith_aziz> pickySmart
[0:07:00] <%hax_metatron> Woolie with glasses: NO, Reggie with glasses: FUCK YES
[0:07:02] <%xerotwo> THE TARNISHED RISES AGAIN
[0:07:09] <RyuuAoi> Thank you, Woolie!
[0:07:09] <+BananaSlammuh> kolGlasses kolGlasses kolGlasses
[0:07:12] <%kushgoku> I wanna see Reggie wear some sick ass aviators
[0:07:14] <leith_aziz> As someone who never used lenses, how do they feel?
[0:07:27] <megaman_sentinel> it's the weirdest thing ever touching your eyeball
[0:07:30] <%livlinn> hewoo wooliePOYO
[0:07:32] <RyuuAoi> Glasses are coming for ALL OF YOU
[0:07:33] <%holydeviant1> My vision is bad enough that I can barely read my store's price sign from my register, my usual joke when someone asks the price is to say "Bad, let me see..."
[0:07:37] <%Deasmeister> it sucks at first but then its fine
[0:07:38] <leith_aziz> I dont wanna do that
[0:07:43] <+Inqy833> Neeeerds
[0:07:45] <+mechslayer71> it's not that bad, I wear them, you get used to it
[0:07:46] <leith_aziz> Which is why I stick with glasses
[0:07:47] <+NottaAlotta> its miserable the first 5ish times
[0:07:51] <megaman_sentinel> you eventually get used to it
[0:07:52] <yukichocomilk> it's only weird at first, then you can used
[0:07:52] <maskedmustelid> considering contacts because damn glasses are uncomfy with a mask
[0:07:54] <karawra> it's hard at first but then it becomes like nothing
[0:07:57] <@Solidus_113> I knew a guy in high school who wore sharingan contacts. he was a nerd
[0:07:57] <%youngking_kush> @leith_aziz Every now and then if I dont take them off they make my temples sore but other than I mostly forget about them
[0:07:57] <RyuuAoi> Contacts are fine. Get dry. But they fine.
[0:08:04] <yukichocomilk> get used*
[0:08:05] <haitakaa> what about eye ball tattoos
[0:08:11] <%radiorosewater> fake contacts are straight up dangerous, i know folk who have damaged their vision from it
[0:08:21] <leith_aziz> @youngking_kush Sounds like what I hear. Maybe I should stick with glasses
[0:08:23] <DelgotHansto> The canon sharingans that were actually blinding people
[0:08:30] <%TreeLeafBoi> lol
[0:08:33] <%xerotwo> REAL ITACHI HOURS LUL
[0:08:42] <%holydeviant1> This discussion reminds me, Woolie: You'll want to keep an eye on your character's eyes in Elden Ring.
[0:08:54] <%Deasmeister> I've been drunk and fallen asleep with them in, shits rough
[0:08:54] <+BananaSlammuh> IRL Mangekyo problems without the powers NotLikeThis
[0:09:12] <%youngking_kush> @leith_aziz Yeah might as well, I only switch up in certain situations
[0:09:24] <emptyantics> Can't wait to see where we end up today!
[0:09:25] <%Hapsam> I couldn't wait for the anime and i need that Elden Ring. I still havent finished it, but this game seems huge enough for a year long LP. And take care of jellyfish, she's a good girl.
[0:09:36] <kadjah> How's the flood?
[0:09:42] <%kushgoku> Oh yea I saw Suzi tweet somethin about her characters eyes
[0:09:53] <Torgue_1> @Solidus_113 Was that guy you?
[0:09:57] <%specters_art88> Just finished the last secret boss and now the last boss. Hopefully finish Elden Ring today 100%ed.
[0:10:01] <RyuuAoi> Pretty good today! We woke up. We blessed not stressed!
[0:10:08] <+NottaAlotta> ive never been more sympathetic to velma than blindly looking for my glasses in a dark room
[0:10:13] <leith_aziz> At this point, waiting for Elden RIng to get patched on PC is starting to feel pointless ER is all I run into in streams
[0:10:16] <%holydeviant1> @Hapsam Jellyfish is actually a super solid summon, upgrades make her super tanky and grants even better poison buildup
[0:10:17] <+mechslayer71> nah faith stays cooler
[0:10:20] <maskedmustelid> I remember reading this thing about where if you wore a pair of glasses that flipped everything upside-down for long enough, your brain would re-wire itself to interpret it as right way up. Then when you finally removed the glasses later down the track, everything would seem upside-down again!
[0:10:21] <%youngking_kush> INT will get alot of stuff down the road
[0:10:26] <%RyTYoung> Yoyoyo Reggie’s excitement for Elden Ring at the end of the stream last night got me hyped gigaboOtsMEOW
[0:10:28] <yukichocomilk> I got the moonveil and MLGS so now i'm weeb'd out and ready to do the rest of the game LUL
[0:10:36] <@Solidus_113> 2nd zone has all the INT gear
[0:10:38] <+Snazzy_Tomato> intelligence is busted
[0:10:46] <%illtima> Respec is super free
[0:10:47] <%Shishi1205> Int Str is a thing too btw
[0:10:53] <%Shishi1205> Can attest to it myself
[0:10:53] <%kushgoku> @woolieversus super high int can get you a literal dragon ball spirit bomb
[0:10:55] <+Javaa01> Yeah the respec item is farmable
[0:10:59] <%TreeLeafBoi> lefgo
[0:11:00] <%Deasmeister> I have a dump truck full of spells and there are some real winners there
[0:11:03] <+LetsStartaRyate> well over 10 respec items
[0:11:05] <%holydeviant1> Even getting upgrade materials gets easier and easier.
[0:11:08] <%ozzrabbit> Gravity Magic is stupid fun ^^
[0:11:12] <lyzejag> Finished the game with 8 of these items, with using 4 of them
[0:11:17] <DSD24> Faith is so cool
[0:11:17] <%youngking_kush> @shishi1205 I'm INT/STR now too and it is busted
[0:11:20] <+Snazzy_Tomato> all of them are solid
[0:11:24] <%holydeviant1> (special weapons are so easy to get to +9 it's almost funny)
[0:11:28] <%oda_flobunaga> Well, Int Faith is a thing
[0:11:28] <%Shishi1205> I'm double welding ugs
[0:11:33] <@Menitta> I still haven't seen much super cool faith stuff and I'm relatively far
[0:11:35] <+slimefancypants> Seems like every build is kinda solid now lol
[0:11:39] <maskedmustelid> soon as you respec faith, then int'll start popping up everywhere
[0:11:42] <%Shishi1205> one is full Str the other is half int half str
[0:11:51] <%Prevot> I even found a fucking sorcery that's faith based, like JUST faith based
[0:11:52] <%holydeviant1> @oda_flobunaga Fundamentalist faith invocations being int-based made my mother cackle when I told her
[0:11:54] <DSD24> I found cool lighting bolts
[0:11:56] <theanora1> Faith and Arc are the dragon head spells, the rot breath is AMAZING
[0:12:02] <%holydeviant1> Because she's a biblical scholar
[0:12:09] <%youngking_kush> I've got the Gargoyle's Twin Blade with Cold damage
[0:12:12] <%Shishi1205> There are incantations that are int based too
[0:12:26] <%radiorosewater> teaowlSippy
[0:12:28] <DelgotHansto> Only combo that gets a bit shafted is Int Arc, theres a couple things but not a lot
[0:12:30] <DSD24> Twinblades are so cool I'm still sticking with the first one
[0:12:32] <%Shishi1205> and that one is super good for status helaling
[0:12:33] <+Your_heals> Can you / is it useful to duel wield different debuff weapons? like one fire and one bleed
[0:12:35] <+slimefancypants> Regardless pump mind tbh lol
[0:12:43] <%radiorosewater> 8
[0:12:44] <leith_aziz> pickyLurk

[0:15:18] <%oneimportantthing> Yooo
[0:15:22] <RyuuAoi> @WoolieWayne
[0:15:22] <+keiji_maede> Woolie trying to be batman here?
[0:15:25] <DSD24> Bloodslash is so cool
[0:15:25] <Zaedum> watch out for that tailwhip
[0:15:27] <Hopit> going deeper into it would spoil some thing @Your_heals
[0:15:30] <DelgotHansto> @youngking_kush I'm well aware and he stomps BK in difficulty, every CK encounter is a major threat, BK is just parry bait at this stage
[0:15:50] <SmortyPuffin> woolie's being too quiet
[0:15:51] <%oneimportantthing> All according to keikaku (keikaku means plan)
[0:16:04] <maskedmustelid> So who will get dizzy and fall down first?
[0:16:12] <RyuuAoi> Yo! Did you not get touched, Woolie!?
[0:16:15] <owensleftfoot> Moveset Downloaded?
[0:16:17] <+POUND_CAKE94> Can't wait to see the calculations that take place for M*****a at the H******ee
[0:16:24] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @DelgotHansto Every CK sword attack is parryable, thou gh.
[0:16:27] <%youngking_kush> @delgothansto No for sure their alot tough, but I meant more relative 5o how their implemented/place in the world
[0:16:29] <%Prevot> I spent so long learning to only get hit by his final slash to guard counter it
[0:16:38] <owensleftfoot> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:16:39] <@Menitta> OH
[0:16:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> PHASE 2 BITCH
[0:16:45] <soloTani> wtf
[0:16:45] <+Ghoulgran> Damn that stomp was the only thing that hit me on these guys
[0:16:47] <emptyantics> LETS GOOO
[0:16:49] <klooswep> AngelThump AngelThump AngelThump

[0:16:58] <+hector_miggins> WTF
[0:16:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> crucible knights are very cool
[0:17:01] <derap41> Scalie knight
[0:17:04] <DelgotHansto> @Fenrisulfr_V Yeah but with weapon arts I never use Parry past DS3 lol, cant lose my cool flips and stuff
[0:17:11] <kpkulmala> I could not for the life of me dodge the tail
[0:17:14] <emptyantics> SO SICK LOVE THESE GUYS
[0:17:16] <emeraldskrull> woolieCRAB_SG woolieCRAB_SG woolieCRAB_SG
[0:17:23] <%hax_metatron> Fuck yeah Woolie, well done man. Great fucking fight.
[0:17:24] <soloTani> so cool
[0:17:26] <%youngking_kush> They are very stagger-able
[0:17:40] <%Prevot> Glintblade is so good, my magic was worthless against him
[0:17:43] <+hector_miggins> GET HIM WOOLIE
[0:17:45] <Zaedum> impressive reading the boss moveset.
[0:17:49] <%Shishi1205> thursts for every sip too
[0:17:59] <%youngking_kush> Like if you dodge his tail swipe and them close the distance with a jump attack
[0:18:04] <LarDosGames> Hey Woolie, you can jump over his tail in case if you didn't know
[0:18:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> thicc tailed crucible-chan
[0:18:29] <RyuuAoi> Let's fucking go! RESPECT, Woolie
[0:18:48] <%youngking_kush> This guy was my early game "git gud" moment for sure
[0:18:53] <%Shishi1205> fun fact you can get ashes of war that are better than that stomp
[0:19:05] <leomuratore> Cool af boss
[0:19:05] <Zaedum> Woolie is so patient it's all very calculated.
[0:19:18] <owensleftfoot> @Shishi1205 Been using Earthshaker with the Guts GS and it wrecks shit
[0:19:28] <%Shishi1205> try frost stomp
[0:19:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> stamina? what's that Kappa
[0:19:38] <%Shishi1205> using it on that ugs too
[0:19:43] <%Prevot> of course not, that would be fair LUL
[0:19:50] <+Jiggisnipe> or maybe he has a lot
[0:19:56] <PunkZedB> you get to play when he says so
[0:20:00] <dundore77> same with magic. enemy mages will just spam moves for a minute straight
[0:20:02] <%youngking_kush> Nah he almost has 80 END lol
[0:20:03] <+benbag13> come on woolie beat up this furry
[0:20:05] <+Snazzy_Tomato> you can stagger here
[0:20:11] <+Snazzy_Tomato> you just gotta be quick
[0:20:11] <+hector_miggins> YOOO
[0:20:19] <okramv> does he get guard broken with greatshields?
[0:20:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:20:21] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @DelgotHansto I'm on my 2nd playthrough now, and I'm using JUST Misericorde + Buckler, with some backup range from Loretta's Bow. SO much more than you'd think is parryable in this game.
[0:20:23] <TheSphereHunter> dont get greedy!
[0:20:24] <Zaedum> dangerzone!
[0:20:26] <klooswep> YOU GO THIS

[0:21:09] <%SainEdge> LUL
[0:21:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> TAIL GET
[0:21:09] <%illtima> NOICE
[0:21:10] <moonbearbacon> how many hours woolz?
[0:21:10] <%hax_metatron> THAT WAS BOSS DUDE
[0:21:12] <maskedmustelid> Got tail?
[0:21:15] <Cynderspark> I tuned in at the best moment
[0:21:15] <moonmintparadise> win
[0:21:16] <%illicitdonut> Just in time to watch the bully fall
[0:21:17] <owensleftfoot> TOUCH FLUFFY TAIL
[0:21:18] <L3m0nTwi5t> EZCLAP
[0:21:21] <RyuuAoi> Woolie with time to plan is literally unstoppable
[0:21:21] <%illtima> Man I fucking hate those knights. The most boring lame-ass knight From ever made.
[0:21:22] <%shakespearo> showed up just in time for some audible swearing LUL
[0:21:23] <agustorm123> That’s a win
[0:21:24] <+Reaverund> I get the sense they're really trying to dissuade players form pure melee. Waiting for openings on bosses is just not feasible in this game
[0:21:24] <hellhound123123> yo EZ
[0:21:25] <klooswep> I felt the clench in my whole body. I've been there so many times in my own game.
[0:21:25] <%Prevot> Seek rump
[0:21:25] <+POUND_CAKE94> I'm glad Woolie is doing that challenging stuff here. It's made for some good fights
[0:21:26] <DelgotHansto> And one of the coolest faith spells in the game
[0:21:28] <foomaster22> Try tail, therefore get behind
[0:21:32] <maskedmustelid> smol tail or thicc tail?
[0:21:32] <+MoonXBearX> gotta rest after that
[0:21:33] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Fenrisulfr_V The craziest thing to me is that certain bosses require /multi-parries/, i.e. parrying them two or three times in a row, to be able to riposte them.
[0:21:34] <owensleftfoot> @illtima wrong but ok
[0:21:34] <%youngking_kush> I'm thinking on switching to a whole Crucivle Knight cosplay build cuz they're so sick lol
[0:21:36] <%oneimportantthing> Lmao
[0:21:37] <karawra> woww
[0:21:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeep
[0:21:37] <%Shishi1205> sheesh
[0:21:43] <+POUND_CAKE94> Coming back and stomping these guys later is fun tho
[0:21:45] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[0:21:46] <+lightbringrrrr> BRAVO
[0:21:49] <%Prevot> jesus woolie
[0:21:55] <%radiorosewater> holy shit man
[0:21:58] <+GunToad> yeah that's the crucible knight fight early lol
[0:21:58] <%Shishi1205> these dudes don't play fr fr
[0:22:04] <berasite> WutFace yikes still faster that me
[0:22:04] <%hax_metatron> You could've come to him later after leveling up when he's a chump, but props for bossing that fight.
[0:22:09] <+MoonXBearX> woolie had to be shittin bricks right there
[0:22:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now you will never lose to one of these guys ever again Kappa
[0:22:18] <+Javaa01> If he didn't manage to buffer that roll in on that shield blowout, he would have been 300% dead
[0:22:23] <%Prevot> at most I must have given him 45 min, before deciding to come back later
[0:22:25] <VincentGraves> there's another one at stormveil castle btw
[0:22:28] <RyuuAoi> I'm still stuck on DS3 final boss. Mad respect, Woolie.
[0:22:37] <+POUND_CAKE94> It's good to lab that enemy too bc there may or may not be a FEW MORE
[0:22:38] <%Shishi1205> yeah on the very bottom
[0:22:43] <sirrice77> You can jump stomps btw
[0:22:50] <%Shishi1205> this game is littered with bosses
[0:22:53] <%oneimportantthing> For whatever reasom, despite knowing their moveset better than everyone, knights always stomp me
[0:22:53] <emeraldskrull> It's time! it's time to crab! woolieCRAB_SG woolieCRAB_SG woolieCRAB_SG
[0:22:54] <sirrice77> jump over*
[0:23:10] <%shakespearo> @RyuuAoi try to hit him before you run out of HP, pro-tip woolieSMUG
[0:23:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @oneimportantthing literally
[0:23:14] <+GilroyGoldBlood> hey chat, did I miss any major stuff in the off stream recap?
[0:23:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Has Woolie just shown the CK fight or did I miss something else?
[0:23:21] <%Hapsam> Hapsam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Couldn't wait for the anime, because i need that Elden Ring. I still haven't finished it, but this game seems huge enough for a year long LP. And take good care of jellyfish, she's a good girl.
[0:23:21] <%youngking_kush> The first time a fuckin Deathbird popped out at me I audible  yelled
[0:23:22] <sapphomet777> woolie . do you.....WANT a tail?
[0:23:23] <+MosesUnspoken> just roll through
[0:23:25] <%Prevot> gotta say, none of the over evergaol bosses I've fought so far are even half as tough as crucible knight
[0:23:26] <Hopit> @GilroyGoldBlood he beat crucible knight
[0:23:31] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Hopit Thanks
[0:23:32] <owensleftfoot> You can also jump his double sword spin
[0:23:33] <+Jiggisnipe> @CappuccinoGuil just CK
[0:23:38] <+Mr_Pylon> Crucible Knight is real
[0:23:47] <%Lion_kun> I rolled through the tail
[0:23:52] <CappuccinoGuil> @Jiggisnipe dope, thanks
[0:24:02] <%oneimportantthing> Man Woolie was in the LAB
[0:24:06] <%youngking_kush> You can jump the first tail sweep, the follow up not so much
[0:24:06] <kadjah> Woolie has a long history of shutting down tail
[0:24:15] <%shakespearo> @kadjah LUL
[0:24:26] <%Prevot> LUL
[0:24:28] <+Jiggisnipe> @kadjah LUL
[0:24:37] <%radiorosewater> teaowlLUL
[0:24:40] <%Lion_kun> He has a moment of vulnerability after the tail whip so I rolled and took a quick poke
[0:24:41] <klooswep> @kadjah *Sound of posture breaking*
[0:24:52] <RyuuAoi> It was the glasses! The glasses helped.
[0:24:57] <Finchit> Why doesn’t Woolie stream on his own? I don’t get it
[0:25:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> HOLD IT
[0:25:01] <owensleftfoot> DONT LET IT SET IN
[0:25:05] <VincentGraves> KALM
[0:25:14] <klooswep> find your zen Find Your Zen FIND YOUR ZEN!!
[0:25:19] <%SainEdge> kalm PANIC kalm PANIC
[0:25:21] <Frazbeee> still recapping?
[0:25:22] <+Jiggisnipe> call a timeout
[0:25:27] <%youngking_kush> @finchit I'm sure he wants to be able 5o play it in the way everyone else does
[0:25:37] <RyuuAoi> @finchit This is The NEW Super Best Friends Play
[0:25:45] <kadulal> wollie sufferd emotional damage
[0:25:49] <klooswep> The most powerful move in this game is taking a deep breath
[0:25:50] <kadulal> the worst kind
[0:25:55] <%oneimportantthing> Imagine if Pat was next to him, it'd be Smelter demon all over again
[0:26:00] <%shakespearo> plus streaming takes energy and distracts from the game, which is not what he wants when clearing out shit that'd be boring on stream
[0:26:17] <moonbearbacon> never tried a parry again?
[0:26:18] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @RyuuAoi no, this is it's own thing
[0:26:31] <%holydeviant1> Crucible is a great fight
[0:26:37] <CruxAustralis> Crucible Knight is tough as nails
[0:26:39] <%Prevot> I always just rolled behind him whe he stomped
[0:26:42] <RyuuAoi> @reverend_roscoe No no no
[0:26:45] <%youngking_kush> For sure, he's harder than fuckin Margit IMO
[0:26:54] <%ekodrop> @RyuuAoi bruh...
[0:26:56] <owensleftfoot> Yeah Fallingstar is for WAAAY later
[0:27:00] <dundore77> There was one boss i got to magic pixel twice in a row i thought i found a boss that had a gimmick that wouldn't die unless i did something but nope somehow despite using a different strategy got him to super small hp left twice.
[0:27:11] <RyuuAoi> @ekodrop Yall Chill
[0:27:21] <+POUND_CAKE94> Yeah parts of Caelid and Dragonbarrow are legit endgame difficulty
[0:27:22] <%p4ntless> beating crucible knight without parrying is some next level masochism
[0:27:25] <+lightbringrrrr> Or be like atpGasm and spend 6+ hours fighting a “boss” at starting level
[0:27:51] <dundore77> i find crucible knights once you know the moveset are easier to dodge than parry
[0:27:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:29:15] <dundore77> Elite mooks
[0:29:20] <owensleftfoot> @youngking_kush Parrying seems to be completely invalidated by guard counter, the only reason I could see for parrying is for flexing purposes
[0:29:21] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @dundore77 See, I feel the opposite. They have multiple moves that are incredibly easy to parry, like the Charging Swipe or the two-handed overhead after the stomp.
[0:29:22] <+POUND_CAKE94> Haven't tried to sleep a single enemy is it usable??
[0:29:25] <LMTTN> Is every Crucible Knight optional? Can I just save them until I can completely ruin them lmao
[0:29:30] <DSD24> For the Golden Order!
[0:29:35] <+mechslayer71> that's a good one
[0:29:38] <RyuuAoi> We do it!
[0:29:40] <MrLetap> Sleep works but its just another way to get some hits in.

[0:30:20] <%pauperofthesouth> THOSE WHO WALK IN DEATH
[0:30:20] <%youngking_kush> @owensleftfoot Yeah for sure. There's probably a crazy Crit Attack build you can make with daggers or something but outside of that I just dont see it
[0:30:20] <toulon_somberjade> They just started

[0:37:21] <agustorm123> Looks like something from GOT
[0:37:23] <zenith0111> @solidus_113 He puts a helmet on later in the story you probably didnt realzie you met him
[0:37:24] <%Shad0wTag> It is a tad bit quiet
[0:37:27] <%Prevot> @Prevot nice
[0:37:28] <%youngking_kush> Buy the "No Skill" Ashe of War from him for your shield, very useful. Let's you use your weapon art without 2handing.
[0:37:29] <%hax_metatron> Look at the last one
[0:37:29] <DSD24> All these good moves
[0:37:30] <Ragnorok64> maytbe I'm just hearing the wind noise of the area

[0:37:41] <@Solidus_113> I did, but he wasn't a merchant there
[0:37:41] <LMTTN> I wish he had a cold one. I have no idea where to get one where I'm at in the game
[0:37:47] <%Shishi1205> get no skill

[0:38:11] <%Reveresao> @shakespearo its heavy tho
[0:38:13] <%Shishi1205> you can no skill weapons btw
[0:38:17] <%Shishi1205> parry too
[0:38:26] <@DashXero> You can even put a parry on weapons. Like the Caestus.
[0:38:27] <%Prevot> it's soooo much better than past games in that aspect
[0:38:33] <yukichocomilk> ashes are the best addition to the weapon system

[0:40:26] <hellhound123123> By the way guys: if you don't know, there's sorting in the inventory. Press R3 and sort by acquisition, should make it easier to find items instead of hunting for them
[0:40:28] <%ChoculaUltra> I know the whole Ubisoft devs talking smack about Elden Ring is trite at this point. Just gotta say its hilarious that Twitch is offering an in-game weapon/gear bundle for AC Valhalla as a twitch prime bonus LUL

[0:41:21] <%shakespearo> one of the tears for the flask had me cackle out loud
[0:41:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @pauperofthesouth a sick whip, that's what it does
[0:41:27] <mantyz> if u apply no skill in your shield, u do the skill in ur right hand when used. Is very nice *.*
[0:41:28] <TigerClaws12> wait he beat knight off stream? LUL
[0:41:32] <owensleftfoot> U WANT SUM TAIL?
[0:41:34] <%pauperofthesouth> @CappuccinoGuil nice
[0:41:35] <LMTTN> Have you crossed the bridge south of the start? I missed the last stream or two
[0:41:38] <AnnoyedApricot> how bout that faith tho
[0:41:38] <+KingpinLarry> Supple ample tail. *Homer gargle*
[0:41:38] <agustorm123> Too bad
[0:41:40] <Dew217> Did wollie beat the game?

[0:41:54] <+Jiggisnipe> @TigerClaws12 he recorded and showed us the run
[0:42:03] <TigerClaws12> @Jiggisnipe ah ok
[0:42:03] <thebalticguy1> time for furry
[0:42:07] <CappuccinoGuil> @pauperofthesouth sadly, has a bit of a windup and doesn't do the double short-to-long hit that CK does in their fight, but still.
[0:42:08] <%ChoculaUltra> I wish you could parry the tail swing into a hilarious Mario-style tail grab throw-riposte animation
[0:42:08] <thepardack> You can click the left stick and you can sort things by most recent
[0:42:15] <+Nobrev> I love my sorcery build but man faith just gets cooler stuff
[0:42:26] <DSD24> Lancer tech
[0:42:31] <%shakespearo> @BananaSlammuh it's a cringy gamer thing, but seeing Rome after ACB WAS really cool. They did a banging job on those cities and then AC3 you had shitty log huts and trees D:
[0:42:38] <%youngking_kush> @nobrev ...but meteors tho lol
[0:42:43] <%pauperofthesouth> @CappuccinoGuil ah bummer.
[0:42:47] <critfumble_> lance gang monhun
[0:42:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @Nobrev I don't know, sorcery has meteor shower, summon swords, tons of cool crystal weapons.
[0:43:01] <%dormoxx__> @nobrev i’m mixing sorcery and incantations and it’s super fun
[0:43:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHERE LUL
[0:43:24] <%youngking_kush> @dormoxx__ You got Sword of Night & Flame?
[0:43:25] <CappuccinoGuil> I think a lot of people THINK Faith got all the love because limgrave is like THE faith area, you get so many spellbooks and such.
[0:43:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> goodlord
[0:43:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @BananaSlammuh I agree, but gotta say I really liked egypt as far as the new stuff is concerned
[0:43:44] <DSD24> Knight Greatsword looks cool too
[0:43:49] <huskarl_zap> has a better animation too
[0:43:54] <Frazbeee> you can customize the ash of war of the knight sword
[0:43:54] <+mechslayer71> @nobrev went faith, have been trying int out, and boy are you correct. every new spell is just more blue shit. moonveil is sick tho
[0:43:56] <%dormoxx__> @youngking_kush nah, some crystal blade. don’t remember the name. got the seal that scales with int though
[0:44:05] <thepardack> The knight's greatsword can take new ashes too, so that might be worth looking into
[0:44:09] <Memitim> HOLLOWSLAYER
[0:44:11] <%radiorosewater> hollowslayer
[0:44:17] <Saturation_Lizard> that's the mirrah greatsword moveset
[0:44:19] <owensleftfoot> YEYEYE HOLLOWSLAYER MOVESET
[0:44:19] <+Flunkorg> thats a hollowslayer
[0:44:21] <Memitim> I've been looking for that moveset
[0:44:21] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Yo, it's got the Mirra sword moveset.
[0:44:24] <LMTTN> The lack of an ender makes it look like Gothic's melee combat
[0:44:24] <%Shishi1205> ye
[0:44:30] <%shakespearo> @BananaSlammuh I haven't checked out the more recent ones, and I'm sure Paris looked nice and that other one, too, I just lost interest and never recovered it
[0:44:36] <%youngking_kush> S/o the Mirrah Knights
[0:44:45] <Treasure_Vault> As someone who loves the biggest, hugest hammers, should I go Str Faith or Str Int?
[0:44:58] <%shakespearo> Str/Str LUL
[0:45:08] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Treasure_Vault As far as I know, there aren't any Str/Int Greathammers.
[0:45:19] <%youngking_kush> Yeah, just big Str and maybe some faith for support spells
[0:45:25] <%pauperofthesouth> nice
[0:45:29] <RyuuAoi> Woolie building towards Faith?
[0:45:31] <DSD24> Wind blade is nice
[0:45:37] <%shakespearo> can't you just put int scaling on a hammer with the smith tho?
[0:45:38] <+SaintSalted> u can repeat it too
[0:45:38] <megaman_sentinel> faith got a lot of love this time
[0:45:39] <Frazbeee> it fuckin does
[0:45:49] <+Javaa01> It goes far, but it collides with geometry pretty easily and that stops it
[0:45:50] <LionShard> the shot actually can combo into itself
[0:45:53] <LMTTN> @shakespearo With a magic or cold affinity
[0:45:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @Treasure_Vault most hammers I've found have just been Str, so I'd say focus on that and put faith/int depending on which spells you wanna use. Remember, there's respecing
[0:46:08] <%youngking_kush> They combined Miracles & Pyromancy which was a very smart decision IMO
[0:46:12] <dundore77> yeah its super easy to change your weapons stats in this game.
[0:46:12] <+mechslayer71> @shakespearo you can, but it'll never be as good as something built for it, I don't think
[0:46:16] <thepardack> Donjon time
[0:46:26] <RyuuAoi> @dundore77 Fr
[0:46:31] <%Lion_kun> Hey Woolz. sit at that grace during night for a fun time
[0:46:36] <%shakespearo> @mechslayer71 that's fine, as long as it's not like, unplayably bad
[0:46:43] <+segmentedfool> Wait until night at the warmaster
[0:46:49] <LMTTN> ER does a really good job of keeping me from worrying I might trap myself into a bad build
[0:46:53] <CappuccinoGuil> Come back to the Warmaster at night if you can
[0:46:58] <%MajorCrasher> I saw someone fight you know who on their stream yesterday and I'm just shocked that they put an MMO raid boss in this game
[0:47:04] <ShepherdShang> Yes! Woolie is going to love what he gets in this one!
[0:47:08] <%Prevot> walking buildings are cool
[0:47:11] <+Flunkorg> chat shut up and let him play the video game lol
[0:47:17] <%youngking_kush> I have like 10 of the item you need to respec, their not too rare
[0:47:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> @majorcrasher that's a wall for me LUL
[0:47:24] <DSD24> Hey that phantom had the fancy sword
[0:47:28] <Ragnorok64> man there's still stuff I've missed in Limgrave!
[0:47:40] <thepardack> @LMTTN I just got into a zone and got like 5 of the respec item. You have a good amount of freedom to mess with your build.
[0:47:48] <LMTTN> The boss door being right at the entrance gives me DeS 1-1 vibes
[0:47:53] <%ozzrabbit> Ha! Woolie has yet to see the Ghibli castle with the big bell
[0:47:53] <DelgotHansto> This might be an unpopular opinion but by the end I couldnt STAND the music in these style of catacombs, idk why I just hate it
[0:47:55] <+Flunkorg> don;t give up skeleton!
[0:47:55] <%shakespearo> I missed the name pop-up, which place is this?
[0:47:56] <%pauperofthesouth> skeleton warriors
[0:48:06] <%MajorCrasher> @th3smartalec yeah I have no idea how I'm gonna beat that guy when I get to him
[0:48:06] <+marlborored5> oh i did this dungeon yesterday, fucking sucks
[0:48:09] <thepardack> @shakespearo Deathtouched catacombs
[0:48:09] <+Nikcadem> skeleton warrior, dah nah nah nah naa
[0:48:21] <+Grayhammatter> just double tap
[0:48:26] <+Flunkorg> the fuck is going on with the stairs
[0:48:27] <+mechslayer71> sweet nothings....
[0:48:28] <%shakespearo> the fuck is happening on thoe staius
[0:48:30] <CappuccinoGuil> oh that wood plank is going WILD
[0:48:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @majorcrasher get huge and lame it out is my plan for later
[0:48:35] <%hax_metatron> Man I love how they mix up even the smallest of dungeons in this game. You think you've seen it before, but NO
[0:48:39] <%shakespearo> it's going nnnNuts
[0:48:41] <%youngking_kush> @delgothansto Yeah, I usually put a podcast on when I dungeon dive lol
[0:48:47] <%Reveresao> @WoolieVersus YEs
[0:48:48] <%Afterman_> fat load after being boned before after care
[0:48:49] <%hax_metatron> YES MARGIT
[0:48:53] <Treasure_Vault> Margit gave you a talisman slot, correct
[0:48:53] <Indigo_Automaton> Yeah it's from Margit
[0:49:00] <Indigo_Automaton> He drops a talisman pouch
[0:49:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:49:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Key Item Talisman Pouch
[0:49:01] <%hax_metatron> See Key item: Talisman Pouch
[0:49:01] <cayitoz> is the lamp not available instead of the torch?
[0:49:05] <DSD24> Nyeh nyeh nyeh
[0:49:12] <Frazbeee> yeah
[0:49:14] <thepardack> @cayitoz might not have seen it yet
[0:49:14] <%Prevot> oh wait I think I recognize this place after all
[0:49:22] <%shakespearo> @cayitoz I don't think they found a merchant that sells it yet
[0:49:22] <+Flunkorg> I wish faith weapons perma killed them like before.
[0:49:23] <owensleftfoot> @cayitoz they havent found the guy who sells it
[0:49:25] <+Flunkorg> AFAIK they don't
[0:49:27] <LMTTN> Has anyone found a ninja-flip equivalent or is light load the lightest load?
[0:49:27] <%radiorosewater> birds should follow
[0:49:32] <%pauperofthesouth> thaat dodge tho
[0:49:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @flunkorg gotta holy
[0:49:54] <VincentGraves> holy buffs are very good against undead
[0:49:56] <+Flunkorg> @Th3SmartAlec oh it has to be specifically holy.
[0:50:03] <+Grayhammatter> i love the crumple on the skeletons
[0:50:04] <%crybirb> @Flunkorg They do
[0:50:11] <disflipmat> Glad to know that pretty much everyone's using the Bloodhound's Fang cause damn is that a good sword
[0:50:20] <%shakespearo> just holy damage or does it need to glow?
[0:50:35] <+Flunkorg> The only reason I say that is because I use the faith/int sword but I still need to kill skeletons "twice".
[0:50:39] <%crybirb> Holy doesn't let them ressurrect or after hit with any wepaon.
[0:50:49] <0078thunder> @shakespearo needs to have a holy buff either from spell or grease. holy damage alone wont do it
[0:50:50] <%dormoxx__> @disflipmat i’ve seen that sword in the majority of pvp videos i’ve seen so far lol
[0:50:51] <VincentGraves> needs to glow
[0:50:54] <%crybirb> @Flunkorg Faith scaling is not the same as holy damage. In DS1 it needed to be holy damage too.
[0:50:55] <zenith0111> @flunkorg Faith Scaling doesnt make it Holy
[0:50:55] <nimu290> @Flunkorg it needs to glow
[0:51:00] <%shakespearo> @shakespearo gotcha, thanks
[0:51:05] <+Flunkorg> @Flunkorg ahhh I see
[0:51:06] <zhenthrim213> yea i use a holy sword too it doesnt perma kill undead
[0:51:08] <Cynderspark> Paiges harem defends this place
[0:51:14] <%Reveresao> Holy needs the glow, like grease or sacred blade
[0:51:14] <%ozzrabbit> How do you make a skeleton laugh? You hit their funny bone.
[0:51:20] <%hax_metatron> Took off your Talisman btw
[0:51:20] <DelgotHansto> @youngking_kush Same, I was usually watching Pat play whenever I did one, definitely never hitting every dungeon again in future runs, only ones I want
[0:51:27] <%shakespearo> @ozzrabbit you can also tickle their ribs
[0:51:28] <DSD24> What is a Skeletons Favorite Snack?
[0:51:37] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 It does, what weapon you are using?
[0:51:40] <DSD24> Spare Ribs!
[0:51:42] <Treasure_Vault> "Don't Worry about Elephant"
[0:51:52] <+Flunkorg> @youngking_kush You get to a point where your so strong going back to do dungeons is just boring.
[0:52:00] <zhenthrim213> @crybirb Ordovis sword
[0:52:04] <VincentGraves> woolie should get a strike weapon
[0:52:05] <RyuuAoi> @dsd24 Ba dum tiss
[0:52:16] <owensleftfoot> skeletons sound way more freaky in this
[0:52:25] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 It isn't holy elemental, only faith scaling
[0:52:31] <DSD24> The Root of all evil
[0:52:35] <DSD24> Oooooo
[0:52:36] <Hopit> @Flunkorg absolutely destroying a dungeon boss in 2 hits is the best feeling ever tho
[0:52:37] <+Flunkorg> There it is
[0:52:38] <%pauperofthesouth> yooooo
[0:52:42] <zhenthrim213> it has holy dmg
[0:52:42] <%Prevot> roots, bloody roots
[0:52:43] <velgaduere> yoooooooooo
[0:52:44] <DSD24> Oh shit
[0:52:45] <@Solidus_113> the baby
[0:52:49] <+Flunkorg> @Hopit eeehhh not after then 15th time lol
[0:52:50] <DSD24> Boom Headshot
[0:52:54] <%youngking_kush> @flunkorg Yeah, I look at them as like "Oh let me try out that weird new weapon skill I got while I'm in here" etc.
[0:52:55] <%Shishi1205> oh yeah I just did this dungeon lmaooo
[0:52:56] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 Actually not even faith scaling, its str and dex.
[0:52:57] <owensleftfoot> Shit happens
[0:52:57] <DelgotHansto> @youngking_kush I set level caps for zones on first playthrough so never had that issue but they definitely got repetitive
[0:52:58] <LMTTN> The player pain cries sound so weird in ER
[0:52:58] <%pauperofthesouth> walk it off
[0:53:02] <DSD24> Looking that picture of that guy in armor
[0:53:04] <%Shishi1205> I completely missed it b4
[0:53:06] <zhenthrim213> its weapon art is a holy slam
[0:53:14] <Ragnorok64> oh crap is he on young female voice 2?
[0:53:24] <+Flunkorg> I should have used this, this moveset is awesome\
[0:53:30] <zhenthrim213> @crybirb it scales with faith
[0:53:31] <megaman_sentinel> just a flesh wound
[0:53:33] <ShepherdShang> Woolie knows he can guard counter arrows, right?
[0:53:41] <%youngking_kush> @delgothansto I've found the overall "pacing" of the game is very good as long you dont go out of your way to grind runes
[0:53:46] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 According to the wiki the weapon art is not holy elemental.
[0:53:57] <+Flunkorg> @ShepherdShang You can guard counter arrows? Does that do anything special?
[0:54:08] <zhenthrim213> @crybirb thts full of shit
[0:54:09] <RyuuAoi> Surrounded!
[0:54:09] <DSD24> Rattle em boys
[0:54:10] <%pauperofthesouth> oh this room some bullshit
[0:54:16] <Hopit> @Flunkorg just a normal guard counter
[0:54:17] <%shakespearo> wombo combo happy feet
[0:54:18] <thepardack> anything you can guard you can do a guard counter attack off of
[0:54:19] <+keiji_maede> Combo!!
[0:54:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bone bois got hands
[0:54:23] <zhenthrim213> it does like 132 holy dmg
[0:54:27] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 Well go complain with the game, it is not holy elemental thats why it doens't permanently down the skeletons.
[0:54:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Paige is sweating somewhere and doesnt know why
[0:54:39] <RyuuAoi> Use your wind spells, Woolie!
[0:54:41] <thepardack> glintstone arc fucks so hard
[0:54:42] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 Ordovis Greatsowrd right? Search the wiki fextralife
[0:54:44] <thepardack> I love that spell
[0:54:45] <+Nobrev> yea yea glintstone arc
[0:54:48] <DelgotHansto> @youngking_kush Yep I was super surprised to find final areas still keeping up at level 150, I thought for sure I'd overlevled despite trying not to
[0:55:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man glintstone arc saved my ass so much
[0:55:18] <velgaduere> good save
[0:55:18] <megaman_sentinel> forgot he was a caster
[0:55:21] <zhenthrim213> @crybirb i know i was just saying tht you need more then just holy dmg to permakill undead
[0:55:22] <ShepherdShang> @Flunkorg When you get close to archers, it crumbles them just like melee enemies
[0:55:24] <%ozzrabbit> It seems the skeletons have a “bone to pick” with Woolie.
[0:55:30] <thepardack> I'm glad that swift glintstone and the carian slicer actually do damage in this. Those have been mainstays for me
[0:55:33] <owensleftfoot> @youngking_kush IIRC the level caps more most stats are 60 now instead of 40
[0:55:34] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 But the wiki is incomplete, I'm going to test it later, but I'm sure anything holy elemental permanently downs undead
[0:55:48] <%MajorCrasher> glinstone arc is the best for enemy groups by far
[0:55:59] <%Prevot> Arc is the GOAT
[0:55:59] <owensleftfoot> sorry I meant softcaps
[0:56:00] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 I used the holy scythe and it downed the skeletons
[0:56:00] <0078thunder> @crybirb nah it doesnt. I tried with the cipher and it doesnt.
[0:56:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:56:04] <zhenthrim213> @crybirb try its weapon art its the spin slam
[0:56:16] <%crybirb> @zhenthrim213 Gonna try, I haven't used many str/ faith weapons
[0:56:26] <%crybirb> @0078thunder Really? It needs a special description then?
[0:56:28] <+Felhad> Occult weapons do permakill them
[0:56:31] <RyuuAoi> One walking in the back
[0:56:38] <%youngking_kush> @owensleftfoot Oh for sure, they definitely expanded everything out. You can tell they learned from most players outpacing the game power-wise in previous games
[0:56:42] <+Flunkorg> *looking at random stock skeleton models* these come up I bet.
[0:56:48] <wandelmilch> A happy door
[0:56:52] <yukichocomilk> adula's moonblade is even better than glintstone arc but it comes way later

[1:00:34] <+slimefancypants> So its just a bug lol? oh well!
[1:00:35] <CappuccinoGuil> When bossses start damaged, take that as a "LORE ALERT"

[1:00:42] <%okuriskyles> A Parked Tark
[1:00:42] <DelgotHansto> Oleg can solo most bosses for the first half of the game no lie
[1:00:42] <%holydeviant1> And this is WITHOUT upgrades!
[1:00:42] <+BrvldrHungryHeart> Oleg is the true Mc in elden ring
[1:00:43] <%shakespearo> Tarkus is back, in Oleg form!
[1:00:43] <+MosesUnspoken> Parkus
[1:00:47] <+marlborored5> that's a bug
[1:00:50] <velgaduere> Parka Tarkus
[1:00:52] <Sparda_blizzard> It happened to me as well
[1:00:52] <+Flunkorg> Oleg isn't even the best summon, summon power rankings are insane.

[1:00:53] <%Shishi1205> Mine was full life
[1:00:57] <hellhound123123> that's a bug
[1:00:57] <+Grayhammatter> i've never seen it happen
[1:00:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Talisman?
[1:01:00] <linSP> Was there deathroot in this dungeon?
[1:01:05] <+segmentedfool> It's not a bug
[1:01:10] <%MajorCrasher> bug
[1:01:19] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, what you pick up?
[1:01:20] <+slimefancypants> no one knows for sure if bug lmao
[1:01:21] <%MajorCrasher> mine was full life
[1:01:21] <%Shishi1205> why is it always bug
[1:01:22] <MajesticBonfire> Immediately getting Oleg once I start another Elden Ring session
[1:01:23] <DelgotHansto> He was full for me
[1:01:24] <%youngking_kush> @flunkorg Oh yeah, I found the "level-up" from Oleg too
[1:01:26] <VincentGraves> I think he's suppose to steal your health
[1:01:28] <+orochiblood> Chat has no idea if its a bug or not lmao
[1:01:31] <%crybirb> @0078thunder oh, weapons with Sacred in the description work, it's not holy but "sacred". Maybe a hidden status? I tried also with Oleg sword and yeah it doesn't kill in one.
[1:01:32] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[1:01:36] <+benbag13> the black assassin was undead
[1:01:39] <+Finnmac5> Oleg aint got shit on Latenna change my mind
[1:01:43] <TigerClaws12> it's not a bug chat, look up what the talisman does NotLikeThis
[1:02:00] <huskarl_zap> it's a talismen
[1:02:00] <RyuuAoi> Chat with their hypothesis
[1:02:01] <%Shishi1205> it was a talisman
[1:02:03] <yukichocomilk> talisman
[1:02:03] <penitentpendant> Praise the BrOleg
[1:02:04] <DelgotHansto> Latenna fans when the enemy moves behind geometry
[1:02:05] <underwater_bear> he's supposed to steal health based on the amulet you picked up
[1:02:05] <+Javaa01> It was a talisman, not a weapon
[1:02:07] <%Lion_kun> Mimic kun is the best bro
[1:02:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> talisman
[1:02:09] <%MajorCrasher> @tigerclaws12 then why did he start at full health for me?
[1:02:09] <CappuccinoGuil> I think it's lore. An assassin in the Deathcomb Catacombs seems out of place, like he came in here and killed the previous boss
[1:02:10] <cayitoz> oleg<lhutel<tear<tiche
[1:02:14] <SunsetJack> Accessorie
[1:02:17] <+KingpinLarry> @TigerClaws12 What tailsman is he using?
[1:02:18] <0078thunder> @crybirb yeah that sounds about right. I wonder if theres any incantations that do sacred, but I havent tested
[1:02:19] <Sopapiglobo100> is a talisman
[1:02:20] <%TheHateFish> @WoolieVersus It be an Talisman
[1:02:25] <morkelebmink> a fully upgraded Oleg is better than you for most of the game
[1:02:32] <underwater_bear> it's a talisman
[1:02:33] <%JetpackMcQuack> Be like Oleg, be a bro

[1:03:09] <%youngking_kush> A DECENT AMOUNT
[1:03:09] <+marlborored5> ENOUGH
[1:03:09] <+Flunkorg> A lot of HP
[1:03:09] <stormhawk9891> A LOT
[1:03:11] <ShepherdShang> It's very good
[1:03:12] <atlaskobe> that sounds OP af

[1:03:13] <thepardack> a LOT
[1:03:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's pretty good hp
[1:03:14] <+mechslayer71> decent enough
[1:03:15] <%youngking_kush> VERY WORTH
[1:03:16] <+Grayhammatter> enough
[1:03:16] <%kimbucha> 17% of your max hp per critical hit, its ridiculous
[1:03:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> lets find out
[1:03:18] <%Afterman_> use that shit
[1:03:18] <+segmentedfool> A significant amount of ho
[1:03:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> That’s the good shit
[1:03:19] <+NottaAlotta> it gives me like half a bar
[1:03:21] <RyuuAoi> Wouldn't hurt to lab
[1:03:24] <velgaduere> Nago time
[1:03:24] <+slimefancypants> half the bar?
[1:03:25] <zenith0111> Vampire Build Pog
[1:03:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Ummmm does bleed count as critical hit though?
[1:03:27] <%ozzrabbit> That thing is stupid useful
[1:03:27] <owensleftfoot> It's VERY good for early game HP
[1:03:28] <SunsetJack> Almostt 20% HP
[1:03:29] <%espanishcanamurciana> Bloodborne baby!
[1:03:34] <%youngking_kush> I use the Blue one
[1:03:35] <%hax_metatron> Great to carry you through to end-gmae honestly
[1:03:35] <spinningchurro> Isn’t the Uchigatana+Blood one of the current metas?
[1:03:35] <lilikura> Bleed procs aren't crits
[1:03:36] <%crybirb> @CappuccinoGuil it doesnt only ripostes and backstabs
[1:03:37] <%kushgoku> I’m 70 hours in and I still keep this talisman on
[1:03:43] <mothdude> So is the boss low health because it's supposed to show off the healing ability of crits?
[1:03:46] <+segmentedfool> The black knife stuff is all pretty damn good
[1:03:50] <dundore77> i never treid it when they mean crits do they mean the poise break move or like a full charged r2?
[1:03:50] <OblivionSword1> good ole uchi
[1:03:50] <atlaskobe> uchigatana Pog
[1:03:51] <velgaduere> @lilikura he does crit a lot, though
[1:03:51] <okamiizero> What's the other talisman he has on?
[1:03:52] <owensleftfoot> @mothdude Yea
[1:03:56] <+Jaromero435> The classic
[1:03:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @crybirb that's what I thought, but someone mentioned "bleed build" and it had me questioning for a bit.
[1:03:57] <%ozzrabbit> By the way, there is a FP version of that talisman
[1:04:02] <atlaskobe> everyone has used lightning uchi
[1:04:03] <+Big50boyy> REEDS
[1:04:05] <RyuuAoi> The OG
[1:04:06] <%kimbucha> @dundore77 they mean the iframe animations where you stab someone
[1:04:11] <DSD24> Sheath stance
[1:04:13] <%crybirb> @okamiizero stamina i think, the turtle
[1:04:14] <%youngking_kush> @mothdude Pretty sure I know why but to explain contains story spoilers
[1:04:16] <%kimbucha> @dundore77 backstabs, ripostes, guard break counters
[1:04:17] <IzanagiNoOokami> Get motivated nerds.
[1:04:18] <tegas_> Blood loss is good to the point where it's probably bugged in this.
[1:04:20] <DelgotHansto> Blood loss + blood loss + blood loss
[1:04:20] <linSP> Uchi with BLOOD SWORD
[1:04:21] <RyuuAoi> CARRYING me through DS3
[1:04:21] <+Javaa01> Exactly as you remember it from DS3, but the weapon art costs a little less FP
[1:04:23] <TigerClaws12> reeds rhymes with weebs
[1:04:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:04:31] <spinningchurro> Vergil mode unlocked.
[1:04:33] <%TheHateFish> Blood Uchi best Uchi (for now)
[1:04:43] <%crybirb> Not vergil yet, i needs to be moonveil to be vergil
[1:04:45] <velgaduere> Blood Uchi would be nuts
[1:04:51] <RyuuAoi> Exactly
[1:04:53] <%JetpackMcQuack> It does some nonsense
[1:04:54] <okamiizero> @okamiizero I meant the other one, the currently equipped alongside Crimson dagger
[1:04:55] <%youngking_kush> The real strength of Uchi now is that you can change the weapon skill
[1:05:01] <LMTTN> Is this the only Uchi in the world outside of the Samurai starter Uchi?
[1:05:05] <%ozzrabbit> *Woolie puts on the Uchi* “I AM MIAMOTO MUSASHI!”
[1:05:07] <%TheHateFish> @velgaduere Only thing better is [Redacted] Uchi
[1:05:07] <%youngking_kush> I put the Million Stab one on mine
[1:05:08] <@DashXero> Please don't mention stuff Woolie hasn't seen yet.
[1:05:14] <kinguseesar> @tegas_ I'd be ok with em nerfing it as long as it's PvP only.
[1:05:14] <%rindy0> why would you want to change the weapon skill? it's so insanely strong in this one
[1:05:15] <CappuccinoGuil> No FP, by the way
[1:05:17] <BreakfastSampler> @LMTTN Yes
[1:05:29] <luftraumm1> weeb sword get
[1:05:29] <Frazbeee> woolie have you seen the new valkyire profile game?
[1:05:30] <RyuuAoi> Back step attack?
[1:05:33] <TigerClaws12> didn't pat tell woolie about meme katana on the podcast?
[1:05:33] <%Prevot> @DashXero pat literally told him on the podcast but whatever
[1:05:38] <%Lion_kun> How about you dual wield.
[1:05:40] <Ragnorok64> can he use the weapon art with no FP?
[1:05:44] <DSD24> Start doing some Haohmaru shit
[1:05:44] <LMTTN> in that case I'd imagine Samurai players might beeline here and get two blood ashes then
[1:05:44] <%youngking_kush> @rindy0 I have another cannot with the same weapon skill, only you cant change it
[1:05:44] <owensleftfoot> Man the katana moveset is so much better in this game
[1:05:54] <%X2Eliah> meme weapon unlocked
[1:05:59] <velgaduere> IAI BABY
[1:06:01] <Afroperonista> nothing personnel
[1:06:02] <BreakfastSampler> @Ragnorok64 the animation plays but the damage isn't done
[1:06:02] <+chronopaladin> the uchi really upped my horseback game over my starting epee
[1:06:03] <+Snazzy_Tomato> as soon as i got this i was able to power stance
[1:06:04] <+Jiggisnipe> Will Woolie become Weeb?
[1:06:04] <DSD24> Wait this is some Ukyo shit
[1:06:04] <RyuuAoi> Ma boi
[1:06:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> Good sword
[1:06:07] <%livlinn> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:06:08] <@Solidus_113> do it with FP
[1:06:10] <yukichocomilk> the L2 R2 does so much stagger
[1:06:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Drink your FP potion
[1:06:21] <VincentGraves> woolie charging a weapon to its fullest can have new moves
[1:06:21] <velgaduere> iaijutsu on these medieval nerds
[1:06:27] <%rindy0> @youngking_kush yeah it's the same skill as uchi but even better and even less of a reason to want to change it
[1:06:34] <+StryderStrikesAt> BURY THE LIGHT DEEP WITHIN!!!!!
[1:06:35] <Kirby_Sauce> that heavy unsheath FUCKS
[1:06:36] <Treasure_Vault> The tang?
[1:06:38] <%crybirb> Yep, Reggie is exactly right, it doesn't clean the blood
[1:06:40] <velgaduere> sick
[1:06:43] <RyuuAoi> Thank you, Reggie!
[1:06:43] <TigerClaws12> weeb insight gained
[1:06:46] <@DashXero> Wow. Those swords were terrible.
[1:06:47] <%cubbywolf> I wonder how many spare blades an army carries
[1:06:51] <%TheHateFish> @Treasure_Vault Katanas are held together with a single pin
[1:06:55] <%crybirb> Blood is thick man, it needs something to clean it, they usually carried folds to clean the blade.
[1:06:57] <stormhawk9891> That's for styling
[1:06:59] <%livlinn> Mine uchi?
[1:07:01] <RyuuAoi> Cause them blades do be getting loose
[1:07:05] <%TheHateFish> In the hilt, going through the tang
[1:07:05] <TheyCallMeVawn> Thats because its for style
[1:07:06] <spinningchurro> Yeah this weapon+ something (either blood or moon) is one of the current metas.
[1:07:09] <+Flunkorg> Katana's are notoriously crap when it came to durability.
[1:07:10] <Afroperonista> just gg bullshit LUL
[1:07:15] <%youngking_kush> Nago doesnt have a Katana though his shit is like a Odachi
[1:07:17] <+Javaa01> Yeah you have to call it out first
[1:07:19] <+Javaa01> But it's fast
[1:07:21] <%Abstract_Endurance> Abstract_Endurance subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! 
[1:07:21] <%shakespearo> good thing there ain't no durability in this
[1:07:22] <%Bread_Assassin> Current build is duel-wielding magic uchi and the real magic katana. Shit's great.
[1:07:23] <+Javaa01> And it hits hard
[1:07:29] <linSP> That just means that katanas are bad
[1:07:30] <+RowenCleric> why are katanas so shitty but so cool
[1:07:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> the L2 is for closing distance fast
[1:07:35] <%crybirb> It does a bunch of structure damage, which is GREAT
[1:07:35] <silvereaglesilvereagle> nostalgic for the pat woolsworth bloodborne playthrough
[1:07:38] <owensleftfoot> @DashXero They were amazing for what their purpose was, they only last resort weapons
[1:07:38] <dundore77> but anime tells me katanas are the greatest sword and can cut anything and never break
[1:07:42] <%cubbywolf> because they swordsmiths made them cool
[1:07:46] <%Shishi1205> ye statuses are passives
[1:07:46] <%espanishcanamurciana> Ashina Cross
[1:07:54] <%cubbywolf> true nipon steel
[1:07:54] <+mechslayer71> it's hits faster
[1:07:56] <%Prevot> powerstancing two katanas procs bleed sooooo fast
[1:07:56] <Goraka91> @RowenCleric They needed to fold it 10,000 times to get rid of the iron impurities
[1:07:59] <%crybirb> @dundore77 Katanas were actually ok swords made with shitty iron hahahah
[1:08:01] <+HairyWario> how long have they been playing?
[1:08:04] <%rindy0> one of the uchi's weaknesses in previous DS was really low durability but this game just did away with durability altogether making it even better
[1:08:11] <kinguseesar> @spinningchurro you mean Moonveil?
[1:08:14] <@DashXero> @owensleftfoot Most weapons are made as last resorts.
[1:08:16] <+Flunkorg> @RowenCleric I mean, when your oponents also have katana's its fine. Its when you start introducing literally anything else lol
[1:08:16] <%jamsbybetty> dual katanas weeb mode is super fun
[1:08:17] <%Reveresao> No weapons upgrades yet?
[1:08:19] <Kirby_Sauce> @WoolieVersus the unsheath heavy tends to nail heads on humanoids for good damage and stun

[1:08:33] <spinningchurro> @kinguseesar what ever moon status effect you can put on it.
[1:08:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> Some people just want more sekiro
[1:08:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Has to be the EXACT same type
[1:08:38] <dundore77> @dundore77 yeah im aware just love the weeb idea of a katana being super swords when compared to western style
[1:08:40] <%Prevot> whenever I'm not being shot at I go full Leonardo mode
[1:08:40] <@Solidus_113> bloodhound is curved greatsword
[1:08:41] <%TheHateFish> @Flunkorg They weren't actually meant for frontline fighting, just for duelling and last resort fighting. Also, the smiths had this mysticism because they took so long to make due to needing to refine their shit iron into okay steel.
[1:08:44] <%crybirb> Double Dagger is super cool
[1:08:47] <+Flunkorg> I believe thats a curve sword technically?
[1:08:47] <CappuccinoGuil> I tried straight sword and dagger, sadly didn't work
[1:08:53] <%rindy0> the uchi weapon art heavy slash does insane amounts of pose damage (And normal damage)
[1:08:58] <%rindy0> and it's fast af to boot
[1:08:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @Flunkorg but not a curved GREAT sword
[1:09:01] <%Shishi1205> there are wepons with mortal draw as their weapon arta
[1:09:02] <+benbag13> the black assassin was undead
[1:09:02] <%livlinn> yeah japan was not rich with materials, so they had to be innovative about their swords
[1:09:02] <underwater_bear> are we ever getting a seikro sequel
[1:09:02] <%youngking_kush> It's so fast
[1:09:05] <%shakespearo> what the fuck, woolie read my mind, I was literally about to ask about this LUL
[1:09:05] <+BananaSlammuh> The menu also organizes the weapons with their same weapon types
[1:09:06] <%Shishi1205> arts*
[1:09:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> He says, with a ring on the Bloodhound
[1:09:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Yo, is it night time???
[1:09:15] <SarahPainAndToil> Is that how canadians say scarce?
[1:09:15] <Treasure_Vault> You'll have fun being you until you hit respecs, and maybe even longer
[1:09:15] <DSD24> I am married to the Twinblade and Battle Hammer
[1:09:15] <mothdude> Upgrade material is soooooo dang scarce for like the first 30 hours.
[1:09:26] <+mechslayer71> it only uses one to upgrade a level
[1:09:28] <+Flunkorg> @Flunkorg Exactly, was just saying in a situation where its 2 people with only katana's its literally better then nothing. Its not a compliment lol
[1:09:31] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus dont be afraid to use somber stones to upgrade, you only use one a level
[1:09:37] <VincentGraves> visiting the ashes vendor at night is a doozy
[1:09:40] <%Prevot> the first one specifically feels so scarce, even more than the later ones
[1:09:43] <@Solidus_113> The game kinda wants you to have a +3 going into stormveil. a lot of the materials will be in caves
[1:09:44] <Kirby_Sauce> what level is woolie's bloodhound blade?
[1:09:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Go to Warmaster now
[1:09:49] <dundore77> upgrade material is much easier once you realize where to go for them.
[1:09:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> Addicted to upgrading
[1:09:53] <%cubbywolf> I feel fine upgrading early in this game
[1:09:54] <%Shishi1205> he has cool spells
[1:09:55] <CappuccinoGuil> It's night time babyyyyy best time
[1:09:56] <%shakespearo> @Kirby_Sauce unupgraded

[1:10:07] <Kirby_Sauce> yeeesshhh
[1:10:09] <kinguseesar> I'm never giving a certain GS up myself. Even if these nipon steels are popular.
[1:10:11] <haitakaa> has Woolie found the summon swords yet?
[1:10:12] <megaman_sentinel> im trying get my faith build ready for pvp
[1:10:12] <Frazbeee> woolie just upgrade it now dont worry about it
[1:10:19] <+Flunkorg> @dundore77 You can get like... I think its 15 in about 10 or so minutes if you take your time at the start lol
[1:10:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes.....feed him Kappa
[1:10:21] <%youngking_kush> Gurranq tried me one time, had to put him back in his place lol

[1:12:55] <DSD24> @crybirb Going Strength Faith really makes you into a Beast Lord since the talisman scales with Faith
[1:12:59] <agustorm123> You should go south tho

[1:13:42] <DSD24> Just the term "grafted" is unnerving
[1:13:42] <haitakaa> alright gov'na
[1:13:44] <CappuccinoGuil> I think she's this game's "crestfallen knight"
[1:13:46] <%Bread_Assassin> Still debating whether to go Str/Fth or Int/Fth for second playthrough.

[1:15:06] <kinguseesar> You guys talking second playthrough and I'm 100 hours in still doing my first lol.
[1:15:10] <LMTTN> I've barely done anything at night in this game
[1:15:10] <%Bread_Assassin> @tuchpi Start from scratch with a new character.
[1:15:11] <%shakespearo> good trade
[1:15:11] <CappuccinoGuil> It's the wilderness, there's always a trap on the grass. It's called poop
[1:15:20] <luftraumm1> it's really funny coming off of pat's UBER playthrough and seeing woolie actually have to vontend with the game
[1:15:22] <%crybirb> @kinguseesar You must be close tho, I finished sunday with 110
[1:15:22] <%youngking_kush> @kinguseesar 120 on my first too
[1:15:29] <%Kaito_Cam> it's almost like there is a storm on this uhhhh what's the word mound?

[1:16:44] <%Shishi1205> get a lantern asa0
[1:16:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @youngking_kush how the fuck... I've been playing for like, 60 hours, I've yet to even ENTER Raya Lucaria
[1:16:46] <+Jiggisnipe> can't control a horse with no hands
[1:16:59] <%Shishi1205> asap. best but of the game
[1:17:02] <@Menitta> two handing on horse just puts your left weapon in your right hand
[1:17:03] <Shion963> he probably doesn't even know lanterns exists yet
[1:17:15] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:17:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:17:15] <Shion963> where's the nearest guy who sells it
[1:17:21] <haitakaa> because on the horse you attack on both sides with the main hand weapon
[1:17:23] <+mechslayer71> you can tho
[1:17:25] <+Azathotic> tbf vendors with lanterns are rare
[1:17:25] <%Shishi1205> swamp in liurnia

[1:42:29] <+KillinYaDreamz> itsssssssssss booty cheeks
[1:42:29] <@Solidus_113> that's far
[1:42:30] <%Reveresao> its far
[1:42:30] <+Krasmeyts> Pretty close woolieFROG
[1:42:31] <+Flunkorg> ...wait what
[1:42:31] <Shion963> man people skirt around Stormveil all the time
[1:42:34] <+Grayhammatter> that's far
[1:42:35] <+Flunkorg> Um, chat?
[1:42:44] <haitakaa> there is a road
[1:42:46] <Happy_D_> He hasn't finished weeping peninsula, has he? Shouldn't we steer him there before he gets overleveled?
[1:42:49] <+Flunkorg> Why isn't she there?
[1:42:58] <SunsetJack> Damn
[1:42:59] <@Solidus_113> game big
[1:43:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Stormhill Shack gets a lot of teleports
[1:43:01] <Shion963> @flunkorg hasn't done Irina
[1:43:03] <user_naim> @happy_d_ if he hits a wall he’ll go back i’m sure
[1:43:03] <mikesapartment> @Flunkorg gotta finish stormvale
[1:43:04] <gryffinp> nothing wrong with being overleveld
[1:43:06] <+anoldtoilet> @Happy_D_ this game is open world for a reason, he can take it in whatever order he wants
[1:43:07] <thebalticguy1> just get the map please
[1:43:11] <%Pillagius> @Flunkorg not the time. Gotta finish Stormveil I think
[1:43:14] <+Flunkorg> @Flunkorg I did it before stormveil though
[1:43:18] <%youngking_kush> @flunkorg You gotta do Morne Castle storyline first
[1:43:24] <+Flunkorg> @youngking_kush aaaaahhhh
[1:43:25] <+anoldtoilet> although yeah weeping is pretty easy if you do other stuff first. but sometimes its fun to stomp low level baddies
[1:43:25] <owensleftfoot> @Flunkorg he hasnt started her questline yet
[1:43:26] <+BlandSpice> @Flunkorg Have to finish weeping peninsula
[1:43:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @thebalticguy1 it's too far into unknown zone, they'd run into a lot of content too
[1:43:43] <moonbearbacon> woolie spending so long hyping up for stormveil he almost skipped into act 2
[1:43:44] <@Solidus_113> I think that's just a moat
[1:44:02] <%Pillagius> @Flunkorg Ah! Makes sense why I missed her for the longest time
[1:44:26] <%cubbywolf> scrape
[1:44:39] <%youngking_kush> The NPC to start that storyline is VERY easily missable
[1:44:45] <Shion963> main gate only
[1:44:57] <haitakaa> man woolie definitely has ocd
[1:45:11] <moonbearbacon> to each his own
[1:45:13] <user_naim> the cartography practice still gets me sometimes.
[1:45:14] <%Pillagius> Who would make a moat on a freaking mountain? The Moat Lay Crew
[1:45:20] <%Prevot> did woolie see the npc summon for margit? he's my favorite npc so far
[1:45:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:45:26] <user_naim> @pillagius nice
[1:45:28] <+tuchpi> they're dicks
[1:45:50] <%youngking_kush> @prevot That's my guy too, I rocked his shit for the longest time
[1:45:57] <user_naim> @prevot yeah we hung out with rogier for the fight
[1:46:17] <%Prevot> yeah, he's cool
[1:46:39] <%youngking_kush> He inspired me to switch to a INT build from Quality lol
[1:47:05] <%CateHecate> CateHecate subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! praise the 6 months! however no maidens ahead...
[1:47:08] <Shion963> I love the item-drop spark. Saves so much attention energy.
[1:47:32] <+hoenhime344> there is so much to love about this game... im like, on an adventure
[1:47:44] <+hoenhime344> a berserk adventure
[1:47:51] <%youngking_kush> @hoenhime344 It's a whole ass odyssey bro
[1:47:56] <Hopit> @Shion963 it's great, except when you also trigger frostbite on your killhit, cos that looks similar LUL
[1:48:06] <Shion963> graverobbing run let's go
[1:48:06] <%slipdog> dont you dare!
[1:48:14] <+SaintSalted> i have found a new love in dual spears
[1:48:20] <%Prevot> jellyfish is shaped like a friend
[1:48:21] <skybeelow> jellyfish fields
[1:48:35] <%youngking_kush> I never kill the turtles or the jellyfish
[1:48:39] <emptyantics> Jellyfish are tarnished best friend’s
[1:48:41] <%youngking_kush> They're goodbois
[1:48:46] <rommlll> no turtle shield then
[1:48:47] <%slipdog> i have never killed one turtle or consumed a single pickled neck.
[1:48:51] <+tuchpi> holy based princess jellyfish
[1:48:54] <%wunp_fxs> jelly buddies!
[1:49:00] <+solzan2000> I kill jelly fish but not the turtles lol

[1:49:09] <+SaintSalted> theyre spirits
[1:49:14] <+OniOniOniiii> they hang around sacred ground, i think
[1:49:14] <+swesterly> they are literally just vibing
[1:49:16] <%youngking_kush> @rommlll You can still get it, I've been using it literally the entire game
[1:49:16] <%Prevot> they're goth jellyfish
[1:49:17] <jacknerik> They're goth
[1:49:18] <prime_name> their the emo jellies
[1:49:20] <rommlll> alrite then
[1:49:22] <andoowhy> goth jellies
[1:49:25] <%TreeLeafBoi> They like the vib

[1:49:32] <SoaringTrumpet> jellies and skellies coming for you
[1:49:34] <skybeelow> jellies n skellies
[1:49:39] <user_naim> i mean why are you robbing the graveyard
[1:49:50] <%youngking_kush> Jellies only fight in retaliation, they've got morals man
[1:49:59] <skybeelow> *jellyfish jam plays*
[1:50:02] <%Shad0wTag> JELLIES AND SKELLIES
[1:50:10] <derap41> next level mounted combat
[1:50:11] <sirrice77> L1 or whatever equivalent makes you swing left on horse btw
[1:50:12] <+JT_Jag> Hey Chat, what progress have I missed since last stream?
[1:50:16] <+JT_Jag> Just got here.
[1:50:27] <%Prevot> I hate running into the aggro jellies, I don't wanna fight them
[1:50:32] <user_naim> @jt_jag we did a skeleton dungeon and saw liurnia
[1:50:46] <jacknerik> @JT_Jag found the back backdoor to stromviel
[1:50:47] <derap41> Hostile is a stong word for what they are
[1:51:05] <+0neReeler> oh shiny
[1:51:05] <+anoldtoilet> yea thats a little item
[1:51:10] <%jamsbybetty> dash in get the item and run away!
[1:51:14] <+silent__chief> so glad i caught an elden ring stream
[1:51:20] <+JT_Jag> Ah, took a peek at liurnia and then immediately turned around because there's still stuff in Limgrave to do, I presume?
[1:51:29] <%jamsbybetty> someone fucked around with the jellies and found out
[1:51:30] <+saintd263> Why they so red though
[1:51:30] <user_naim> @jt_jag yup
[1:51:31] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[1:51:32] <+mechslayer71> did he attack them.
[1:51:34] <Necnill> Bad scene
[1:51:34] <KgKid51> KEKHeim
[1:51:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Get the item and run
[1:51:36] <skybeelow> he jus nappin
[1:51:37] <derap41> They're Jellyfish Woolie
[1:51:38] <+saintd263> jumped
[1:51:39] <+solzan2000> uh oh
[1:51:40] <BlackermanZX> WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD MF
[1:51:43] <+RocketBarrel> D:
[1:51:44] <gryffinp> dey angy
[1:51:45] <+Krasmeyts> D:
[1:51:46] <%youngking_kush> I think those might be the only ones that start out hostile
[1:51:47] <Shion963> no those two are just aggro
[1:51:47] <+0neReeler> do the ole dash and grab
[1:51:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @mechslayer71 no, he got near the aggro hellies
[1:51:54] <crackedhappiness> jelly gang
[1:51:58] <+JT_Jag> Has Woolie still don't bought glintstone pebble
[1:51:59] <MajesticBonfire> Disturbed their mourning
[1:52:03] <PepperJam_Art> @mechslayer71 no, sometimes they already come like this
[1:52:03] <skybeelow> *jellyfish jam intensifies*
[1:52:04] <+JT_Jag> *still not
[1:52:06] <+anoldtoilet> he dont need pebble
[1:52:15] <Shion963> one more item
[1:52:16] <%livlinn> jump up?
[1:52:24] <+anoldtoilet> magic glintblade and arc are really good
[1:52:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:52:25] <+0neReeler> their kid jam
[1:52:32] <%youngking_kush> Getting Pebble is the first step on becoming a wizard Harry
[1:52:33] <crackedhappiness> We need our hero spungebob to save us
[1:52:46] <+JT_Jag> I really don't like magic glintblade, it's like 3x more expensive than pebble for 1.5x its damage at best
[1:52:50] <moonbearbacon> hmm
[1:52:55] <Shion963> wasn't there an ash there?
[1:53:00] <Hopit> yes
[1:53:03] <%MajorCrasher> yep
[1:53:03] <moonbearbacon> missed item
[1:53:13] <+hoenhime344> hes so scared lol
[1:53:20] <+silent__chief> Using map markers on my 2nd playthrough has been a blessing
[1:53:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @JT_Jag huh, glintblade did a lot more damage for me early on, more than pebble for sure
[1:53:28] <+tuchpi> wait wtf LUL
[1:53:28] <derap41> Nice parting gift
[1:53:28] <%youngking_kush> Did she die?
[1:53:30] <+silent__chief> Marking NPCs especially
[1:53:30] <$Rafraud> Dead
[1:53:30] <%akajaybay> she gave youa  jelly ash, she wanted you to say hi t oher comrades that went into stormveil and didnt come back
[1:53:34] <$Rafraud> Kappa
[1:53:34] <crackedhappiness> she joined the jelly clan
[1:53:34] <%livlinn> weirdr1Cry
[1:53:38] <+anoldtoilet> @JT_Jag the damage is less important than it being hard to dodge and set up as a turret. and yeah it does more like double at least
[1:53:38] <%Shishi1205> not dead
[1:53:39] <%MajorCrasher> skipping stormveil probably triggered that
[1:53:43] <%Prevot> huh
[1:53:45] <+mechslayer71> I wonder what area woolie hasn't even back to in a while....
[1:53:46] <+conqab> oh
[1:53:47] <CappuccinoGuil> He'll figure it out, folks
[1:53:53] <+Rygaklu> probably from going into area 2 yeah
[1:53:55] <$Rafraud> Super dead
[1:53:56] <%youngking_kush> I think walking into Liunaria might have killed her lol
[1:53:58] <$Rafraud> Kappa
[1:54:00] <derap41> They're just jellyfish
[1:54:00] <+Juicce> oh because they hit luirnia, this is new to me
[1:54:02] <%youngking_kush> That's not good
[1:54:04] <%BigBruthaThunda> ohhhhh no
[1:54:07] <+silent__chief> entering liurnia moves like 2 sidequests i believe
[1:54:09] <Shion963> they were looking for a fight
[1:54:09] <+anoldtoilet> AI finds it really really hard to dodge glintblade
[1:54:13] <prime_name> there goes spirit upgrades
[1:54:13] <+hoenhime344> is woolie going to Bolitaria today?
[1:54:16] <%CateHecate> 6 sets
[1:54:17] <Frazbeee> oh you fucked up
[1:54:20] <%hiswill98> Not dead, right?
[1:54:22] <buerdo> 6?
[1:54:24] <%SarcFa> @prime_name is fine
[1:54:25] <%CateHecate> channeller woolie
[1:54:27] <CappuccinoGuil> There's 1000+ sets of eyes AND STILL we get lost
[1:54:32] <BlackermanZX> grant us eyes
[1:54:32] <%Reveresao> no not dead and shut it chat
[1:54:36] <+JT_Jag> Personally I like Glintstone Stars more as an early alternative to pebble because it tracks great
[1:54:37] <$Rafraud> Ultra dead Kappa
[1:54:38] <Shion963> back to the jelly crib
[1:54:43] <+conqab> is there a way to revive her
[1:54:44] <%radiorosewater> oh no you cant get the scrimblo bimblo ending now
[1:54:46] <ckbooks> Skyrim your way up there
[1:54:47] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:54:51] <Shion963> jank jank jank
[1:54:55] <+solzan2000> ayyy
[1:54:55] <+hoenhime344> its a goat... its ment to climb walls
[1:55:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Is the incline over 90 degrees? Torrent is a goat, we got this
[1:55:13] <BlackermanZX> murder the jelly younglings maybe
[1:55:21] <Shion963> not those two
[1:55:26] <%shakespearo> do they ever call torrent a horse in this or do they just say steed?
[1:55:30] <DSD24> Noo the Jellies are cute though
[1:55:32] <+anoldtoilet> @JT_Jag yeah its cool, it feels like there are advantages to many of the spells
[1:55:37] <Shion963> yep there it is
[1:55:37] <CappuccinoGuil> @shakespearo just steed
[1:55:38] <%youngking_kush> Guys ots okay she isnt dead
[1:55:40] <+anoldtoilet> and its not like "this one is better than this one" over and over
[1:55:41] <+Krasmeyts> Clap
[1:55:42] <%X2Eliah> those are alright
[1:55:43] <BlackermanZX> murder them anyways kolWESCI
[1:55:43] <%CateHecate> Chuck Steed
[1:55:46] <+anoldtoilet> like, you have a reason to use most of em
[1:55:46] <%youngking_kush> I checked Fextralife
[1:55:47] <derap41> Another summon that's never getting used
[1:55:48] <%akajaybay> those guys are pretty steady
[1:55:52] <+tuchpi> chad ashes
[1:55:52] <$Rafraud> Mega dead
[1:55:52] <+scarman125> aww man I totally lost track of time
[1:55:54] <+JT_Jag> Glintstone Stars' damage isn't amazing, but it *will* hit
[1:56:02] <+JT_Jag> even if you're like on horseback
[1:56:03] <wqorst> oh boy summon some trash mobs
[1:56:07] <+silent__chief> Wolves are cooler
[1:56:08] <%mr_sups> I use that Ash all the time
[1:56:09] <+0neReeler> oh its a skip
[1:56:12] <Shion963> actually pretty good. Not Oleg good, but still
[1:56:13] <DSD24> I like Duos
[1:56:15] <captain_kirkhammer> they're GOOD tho
[1:56:15] <derap41> Yeah trash
[1:56:26] <%jamsbybetty> but they're ghost versions so they're superior
[1:56:27] <+orochiblood> theyre not bad
[1:56:27] <%akajaybay> the one melee and one ranged is handy
[1:56:29] <%TheHateFish> They're not Oleg
[1:56:31] <derap41> Dogs and Skeletons are better
[1:56:31] <+solzan2000> the disrespect!
[1:56:32] <nimu290> i been doing work with them
[1:56:35] <%SainEdge> i like these two, good for the low cost
[1:56:36] <lymund> they will make you look better tho lol
[1:56:39] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:56:40] <%jamsbybetty> the skeletons are great
[1:56:44] <+anoldtoilet> yteah there are a couple real ones
[1:56:48] <captain_kirkhammer> They're two tough bodies, that matters sometimes
[1:56:48] <BlackermanZX> trust Broleg
[1:56:48] <+anoldtoilet> i really like the spirit summons
[1:56:53] <$Dreigun> they're decent if you aren't building mind for the big boys
[1:56:53] <%Prevot> wolves aren't tough enemies but they're not a bad summon
[1:56:55] <moonbearbacon> jelly is friend
[1:56:55] <+Catpurnicus> jellyfish tanks
[1:56:57] <Shion963> yo Godrick soldiers getting dissed
[1:56:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Jellyfish tanky AF
[1:56:58] <derap41> Jellyfish can be good
[1:56:58] <%youngking_kush> Any one that has an actual name is top tier
[1:56:59] <dralakbadusk> Jellyfish tanka
[1:57:06] <JeoDood> jelly a tank
[1:57:08] <+Catpurnicus> JellyTank
[1:57:09] <%jamsbybetty> jellyfish is a fat tank and draws aggro real well

[1:57:37] <DSD24> She also does cool melee moves too
[1:57:37] <wqorst> could this be a progress?
[1:57:37] <CappuccinoGuil> You could sell some stuff at Roundtable too
[1:57:38] <VincentGraves> oleg is real, until you get to Caelid
[1:57:56] <+scarman125> Oleg never stops being real
[1:57:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Near enough, Roundtable selling stuff would do it, though
[1:58:02] <+anoldtoilet> i like the headless knight w lances who throws lances
[1:58:03] <Frazbeee> godrick is gonna be easy peasy if he uses oleg
[1:58:11] <BlackermanZX> he got a seed right?
[1:58:13] <derap41> Aure Jelly?

[2:02:29] <olaksi> @Shion963 ok, but i meant in game
[2:02:31] <marcomatame> I hope that if there's DLC for Elden Ring, it's kind of the opposite of the main game, just one level, but absurdly dense, make it 4 Dark Souls levels crammed into one
[2:02:38] <%JetpackMcQuack> I want to read that simarillian
[2:02:43] <%radiorosewater> pickle stone?

[2:03:32] <marcomatame> @Th3SmartAlec haven't played the game, i have the no-moneys sadly
[2:03:33] <%Bread_Assassin> I expect any DLC to be roughly Weeping Penisula sized at least.
[2:03:34] <%oda_flobunaga> Maybe, DLC Atlantis Zone
[2:03:34] <DSD24> Some cool shit
[2:03:43] <%Hapsam> @oneimportantthing yeah, im not sure if hes sandbagging or pure
[2:03:50] <+solzan2000> DLC an extra two layers

[2:08:56] <DSD24> @theoldone001 I miss the PSP
[2:08:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, a night run
[2:08:59] <reasonance> @luftraumm1 you can get it from a couple different spots I think
[2:09:03] <Shion963> @luftraumm1 north, east, and south, I think
[2:09:12] <%oneimportantthing> The PSP was so underappreciated
[2:09:13] <user_naim> Try to remember some of the basics of CQC
[2:09:15] <TigerClaws12> oh boi
[2:09:19] <+0neReeler> this castle is pretty tight
[2:09:24] <luftraumm1> @luftraumm1 so south is probably the easiest to find?
[2:09:38] <prime_name> where did the term legacy dungeon come from?
[2:09:41] <+solzan2000> I love/hate this castle lol
[2:09:43] <user_naim> ahh fuck i missed this item
[2:09:44] <tegas_> This is probably the weakest of the legacy dungeons in this but it's great,
[2:09:52] <urkleturtle> stormveil is an amazing first introduction to the legacy dungeons
[2:09:52] <tubit> i missed it too
[2:09:56] <%TheHateFish> @prime_name It's official terminology the devs use
[2:09:57] <%Prevot> so for real, letting FromSoft design levels with the expectation that the player can jump was kind of a mistake
[2:09:59] <%oneimportantthing> Is this the Wall from GoT
[2:10:01] <%youngking_kush> @prime_name Its because they're the most similar to classic DS levels
[2:10:05] <%Prevot> there's so much hidden shit behind jumping
[2:10:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @prime_name fromsoft themself refer to these large dungeons that way
[2:10:08] <dundore77> i can't imagine a souls game without jump now honestly. its added so much explorability and map use.
[2:10:08] <+0neReeler> probably to indicate a souls level
[2:10:14] <prime_name> gotcha
[2:10:17] <+hoenhime344> lul you into a false sense of security\
[2:10:21] <Shion963> @prime_name from said it themselves, something about how it's not all open world, and some areas are legacy dungeons
[2:10:24] <+tuchpi> @Prevot just jump 4Head
[2:10:58] <DSD24> Slaps the roof 'You can fit so much content in this castle"
[2:11:02] <reasonance> jumping almost opens things up TOO much, some of these bigger areas are a nightmare to clear out because of just how many possible paths there are to check
[2:11:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh this is where the fun begins
[2:11:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> doot
[2:11:09] <+OniOniOniiii> yeah if the stone doesnt shatter, u should get to pick it back up thats cool
[2:11:12] <DSD24> Dooooot!
[2:11:12] <tubit> i hate this dooting asshole
[2:11:13] <user_naim> the madness stat is just me trying to keep a mental map of this fuck hole
[2:11:14] <%radiorosewater> big doot
[2:11:18] <+0neReeler> no fear of heights?
[2:11:19] <%Prevot> even these Legacy Dungeons are waaaaay more open then previous games areas
[2:11:20] <+solzan2000> uh oh
[2:11:25] <%youngking_kush> @woolieversus Dont forget you can jump while exploring
[2:11:26] <+theoldone001> Its crazy how big, but also dense and full of stuff the castle is.
[2:11:28] <DSD24> These enemies are cool
[2:11:38] <+anoldtoilet> yteah stormveil is honestly one of my fav from soft levels
[2:11:39] <+anoldtoilet> already
[2:11:39] <OldManDeckardCain> if this was reggie they would have fallen off by themselves
[2:11:39] <%RyTYoung> Oooooo
[2:11:41] <agustorm123> Ohh summon his dad LUL
[2:11:44] <+anoldtoilet> its their best big castle
[2:11:52] <sundizzle> yo that brass shield is probably the best medium shield in the game though
[2:11:57] <kevlarkoala> @OldManDeckardCain and then reggie would have rolled right after them LUL
[2:11:57] <stormhawk9891> For a bunch cannon fodder these guys look pretty cool
[2:12:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> A fashionable red scarf
[2:12:04] <%Prevot> man I fucking love that blue and yellow shield
[2:12:04] <+anoldtoilet> lol it is. high str requirement but the shield owns.
[2:12:06] <luftraumm1> has anyone advised woolie on having barricade shield? or is it too much backseating?
[2:12:07] <Shion963> has parry but much lighter
[2:12:08] <%shakespearo> is it? is it even the best big castle in the game
[2:12:09] <%Prevot> is so pretty
[2:12:10] <DSD24> Nah man get Blood drunk
[2:12:12] <+theoldone001> Yeah I didn't find any other standard shields better than the Bras one
[2:12:16] <DSD24> Like in the 300 PSP game!
[2:12:16] <klooswep> BOP no bloodlust
[2:12:23] <+anoldtoilet> @shakespearo i havent beat the game yet but its the best one early on >_>
[2:12:28] <%youngking_kush> @luftraumm1 No Skill > Barricade
[2:12:37] <+theoldone001> I did find some fun ones with some gimmicks
[2:12:43] <+anoldtoilet> raya lucaria is also a very fun dungeon but this one is a little bigger and cooler imo
[2:12:43] <+solzan2000> does this shield stack with wep?
[2:12:49] <luftraumm1> @youngking_kush fair, but barricade is so tanky
[2:12:56] <%shakespearo> @shakespearo neither have I, but places sound hella cool LUL

[2:15:04] <%oneimportantthing> The late game birds are a fuck
[2:15:06] <DSD24> Lemon Pepper steppers is really funny
[2:15:07] <+mechslayer71> anyone else feel like int is strong but nowhere near as cool as faith
[2:15:11] <+solzan2000> a smart madman
[2:15:15] <Stofil42> this area is truly enormous
[2:15:18] <+solzan2000> birds are random asf
[2:15:19] <%MajorCrasher> imagine petshop with sword feet
[2:15:21] <%radiorosewater> should they follow? nobody knows. birds know. big birds
[2:15:21] <%shakespearo> from soft birds are somehow even worse than from soft dogs
[2:15:28] <+Akizea> @mechslayer71 nah they're both pretty even by end game
[2:15:30] <DSD24> Caaaw!
[2:15:31] <Shion963> @mechslayer71 yeah I do

[2:15:42] <+swesterly> @swesterly lemon pepper steppers and they're leather
[2:15:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> They could be anywhere
[2:15:44] <%hax_metatron> Nah wait till Woolie gets all the cool INT stuff. We stylin for days LUL
[2:15:46] <%oneimportantthing> FromSoft really outdid themselves with the Legacy doungeons
[2:15:47] <%alloVera> gigaboOtsAncientEvil gigaboOtsAncientEvil
[2:16:16] <%oneimportantthing> Like some of these legacy zones have SO MANY layers and verticality to them
[2:16:21] <%kimbucha> fuck them birds

[2:16:22] <%radiorosewater> big bird parries
[2:16:26] <+mechslayer71> @akizea I'm over 110 hours in, and honestly the sorceries I've tried aren't even remotely as cook as the faith
[2:16:30] <+anoldtoilet> @hax_metatron everything that says Carian on it is so sick
[2:16:30] <olaksi> birds are the new dogs
[2:16:43] <DSD24> Is that where we started?
[2:16:48] <mikesapartment> tutorial island
[2:16:49] <+swesterly> visions of familiar
[2:16:50] <%kimbucha> @DSD24 yes
[2:16:55] <Treasure_Vault> Elden Ring looks like the culmination of everything fromsoft learned since kings field
[2:17:01] <%oneimportantthing> Visions of tutorial
[2:17:03] <gryffinp> letting fromsoft level designers design around players having a real jump button may have been a mistake
[2:17:07] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[2:17:11] <DSD24> @kimbucha Rad
[2:17:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @mechslayer71 the game likes to hide the really cool sorceries, but they ARE there
[2:17:20] <Treasure_Vault> Look at the Ringed City DLC and how open the level design was. Compare it directly to this.
[2:17:26] <sundizzle> @mechslayer71 int is way better for the first half of the game, but endgame faith is so fucking sick
[2:17:31] <%Prevot> this game is absolutely everything they made from DeS on combined, except legeally distinct
[2:17:35] <DSD24> The man was pecked to Death
[2:17:36] <+anoldtoilet> there are so many spots in levels where they try to trick you by making you think its a waist high wall and impassable but you can just jump over it
[2:17:40] <+anoldtoilet> this trick is used 1000000 times
[2:17:43] <+hoenhime344> siege

[2:18:11] <%MajorCrasher> Reggie LUL

[2:24:34] <+redbeast4u> lmao, you laugh now, but that's how it used to work xD
[2:24:36] <+anoldtoilet> bloodborne mode also
[2:24:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Some weapons also just DON'T have a "2-hand" option
[2:24:39] <DSD24> Looking like Fulgore a little bit
[2:24:40] <%Prevot> just straight up wolverine moves
[2:24:40] <BlackermanZX> now you only need yellow spandex and you are set
[2:24:40] <chambatron> How far is woolie off stream?
[2:24:40] <+anoldtoilet> yeah you can
[2:24:50] <%youngking_kush> You totally can
[2:24:52] <+anoldtoilet> you lose the block if you actually powerstance but you get a different 2h moveset i believe yes
[2:24:53] <+Brassnarwhal> the moveset is in fact different
[2:24:57] <PepperJam_Art> you can but it's just power stancing
[2:25:00] <SoaringTrumpet> bleed em
[2:25:01] <+Grayhammatter> berserker barrage!
[2:25:03] <%youngking_kush> Good for 2 different status effects
[2:25:05] <+Arnoldoaad1> does 2 different claws work? I never tried
[2:25:07] <7c_nickel> The jump attack on two claws is strong
[2:25:08] <%Majkir> You can powerstance different claws with different status and such.
[2:25:14] <%Prevot> this applies bleed super fast
[2:25:20] <@Solidus_113> you'll always want to keep a quickstep weapon on hand
[2:25:22] <DSD24> I saw a Ninja Turtle
[2:25:22] <skybeelow> shunk shunk
[2:25:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Someone made a ninja turtle LUL
[2:25:25] <%youngking_kush> @arnoldoaad1 Yeah, you can only use one set at a time tho
[2:25:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> The science is still underway
[2:25:37] <+Arnoldoaad1> ok, thnks
[2:25:37] <skybeelow> snkkt
[2:25:39] <PepperJam_Art> I imagine cold claws must rule
[2:25:46] <%radiorosewater> scientists agree, this is a fuck
[2:25:46] <%CateHecate> Its the same trick that youve seen literally 4? 5 times now?
[2:26:01] <Ultimatefool> It might work this time though!!
[2:26:06] <Shion963> hey if it works
[2:26:07] <CappuccinoGuil> 9 out of 10 scientists agree: this is a fuck
[2:26:08] <user_naim> my gun is better than your gun
[2:26:13] <SoaringTrumpet> I really like the delay on those spells so you can rush in after
[2:26:17] <toulon_somberjade> Cold claws do rule
[2:26:18] <Treasure_Vault> It's actually funnier if it works the fifth time
[2:26:22] <Idon__> lmao the phantom backseats LUL
[2:26:23] <+solzan2000> dirty
[2:26:25] <%CateHecate> you thought
[2:26:29] <%notsoy> just because you've seen the trick doesn't mean it won't work, I'm pretty sure peachsaliva got got

[2:30:31] <+Das_Prints> @souptrader it was the guy who locked that door that laughed. Not the knight.
[2:30:33] <+JamOSlam> Wait, am I crazy or did he not use his wind abilities?
[2:30:35] <a_bald_bro> As a greatshield user I never take that shit off
[2:30:51] <sirrice77> Yeah he didnt use his wind abilities for whatever reason
[2:30:54] <tubit> i wonder if that's a throwback to that blind boss in demon's souls
[2:30:56] <%kimbucha> greatshields are made for counters yeah
[2:31:00] <+Das_Prints> @jamoslam yeah he never got the chance.

[2:34:39] <toulon_somberjade> Definitely compliance issue
[2:34:39] <+silent__chief> smells like ubisoft dev in here
[2:34:39] <+TeeSeeDubs> UX issues? Kappa
[2:34:40] <+Nonzi_> same thing with activating summon spots
[2:34:42] <%CateHecate> literally died in a dungeon today because "heavy door has opened" prompt didnt drop for like 15 full seconds @WoolieVersus
[2:34:44] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> are you saying the current compliance has failed woolie? 😇

[2:35:11] <toulon_somberjade> Like that and some issues with message placement killed me several times
[2:35:19] <%shakespearo> @KeiganOfAstora in the stream or overall
[2:35:25] <%youngking_kush> Guys you just hit triangle to get rid of pop texts early
[2:35:25] <%Hapsam> @KeiganOfAstora limgrave, start of storm castle

[2:35:35] <KeiganOfAstora> Cool
[2:35:38] <%radiorosewater> @KeiganOfAstora started stormveil
[2:35:39] <%slipdog> souls gets away with having 1996 QoL for some reason.
[2:35:44] <olaksi> a prize should make a souls player do a full 360 degree room sweep honestly
[2:35:46] <+orochiblood> @toulon_somberjade sounds like a skill issue, casual Kappa
[2:35:46] <Josef_Stryker> @sundizzle Where do u get it?
[2:35:47] <KeiganOfAstora> I can only watch if it's an area I've already cleared
[2:35:57] <yukichocomilk> @slipdog it's literally 1 small issue, relax LUL
[2:35:58] <KeiganOfAstora> I beat Stormveil and half of Liurnia
[2:35:58] <sundizzle> Josef_Stryker you can farm them off of stormveil knights
[2:35:59] <DancesWitBalrog> That stance is SICK
[2:36:00] <+anoldtoilet> @slipdog because its more fun this way
[2:36:04] <Undenizen> I just got here from the anime!
[2:36:13] <MyNameIsRasus> that's some good sound design
[2:36:14] <%slipdog> if only if only it was one issue dangKEKW
[2:36:14] <KeiganOfAstora> What bow is that/where'd he get it?
[2:36:16] <+hoenhime344> bow seems cool
[2:36:18] <toulon_somberjade> @orochiblood Ladders
[2:36:20] <clapbeatt> that looks really satisfying
[2:36:22] <kinkade_77> u get that later

[2:36:25] <wqorst> how does he have that bow?
[2:36:27] <KeiganOfAstora> I want that bow
[2:36:29] <+TeeSeeDubs> @KeiganOfAstora Horn bow underground area in Limgrave
[2:36:35] <%shakespearo> @wqorst found it underground
[2:36:35] <BlackermanZX> behold, big hole
[2:36:36] <KeiganOfAstora> Fucking what?! LUL I love this game!
[2:36:37] <+Das_Prints> @keiganofastora Horn bow. You find it Sofria river.
[2:36:38] <+solzan2000> the bow I have is wack asf :(
[2:36:42] <+anoldtoilet> @slipdog hey i dont kbow if youve heard but tekken still has delay based netcode in 2022
[2:36:42] <DancesWitBalrog> I'm 70hrs in and didnt find that bow LUL
[2:36:46] <KeiganOfAstora> Oh the underground places. I didn't do those yet
[2:36:48] <%youngking_kush> idk man, I mean get peoples complaints but I've never 4wally had an issue with FS' UI
[2:36:57] <Josef_Stryker> I feel like I'm missing so much where I am
[2:37:03] <KeiganOfAstora> I don't understand them at all. Where's the progression down there?
[2:37:06] <%youngking_kush> Granted I have been navigating for like 10 years but still
[2:37:07] <+anoldtoilet> @DancesWitBalrog its well hidden
[2:37:09] <klooswep> Smh you telling me the basic guards and servants in this castle can't afford Yeezys?
[2:37:16] <%youngking_kush> navigating it*
[2:37:20] <@Menitta> The only problem I've had is I wish I could spend gold runes at a grace.
[2:37:29] <%Prevot> @KeiganOfAstora in Siofra? Seek fire
[2:37:33] <Undenizen> that build it looking kinda... pancakey?
[2:37:33] <DancesWitBalrog> @DancesWitBalrog this game is so amazing
[2:37:34] <KeiganOfAstora> Okay thanks
[2:37:38] <KeiganOfAstora> So much to do
[2:37:47] <%shakespearo> oh yeah, SO much
[2:37:52] <sirrice77> @keiganofastora the underground areas are entirely optional for completing the game
[2:37:57] <%radiorosewater> clever message placement
[2:38:01] <KeiganOfAstora> I'm going battle mage. Pumping Int and whatever STR/Dex I need for weapons
[2:38:03] <%shakespearo> there are no optional parts to fromsoft games
[2:38:06] <user_naim> SingsNote I’m stiiilll aaliiveee SingsNote
[2:38:09] <KeiganOfAstora> @sirrice77 Nothing is optional
[2:38:11] <sundizzle> KeiganOfAstora the underground areas also have to do a lot with a certain questline
[2:38:12] <KeiganOfAstora> It's all content
[2:38:13] <%youngking_kush> @woolieversus The laugh wasn't the Knight, it was the guy from the gate that told you to go around
[2:38:19] <%Prevot> I mean, isn't eveything besides the legacy dungeons optional?
[2:38:25] <%youngking_kush> He also steals 30% of your runes
[2:38:30] <+anoldtoilet> theyre just making a joke about how theyre going to want to play it anyway
[2:38:36] <%youngking_kush> He's like following you
[2:38:37] <+anoldtoilet> but yes
[2:38:40] <sundizzle> Prevot several legacy dungeons are optional
[2:38:43] <%MajorCrasher> @prevot even some legacy dungeons are optional
[2:38:45] <+anoldtoilet> @Prevot most of the legacy dungeons also optional yeah
[2:38:54] <+anoldtoilet> something like 80 percent of this game doesnt need to be done to complete it
[2:39:00] <+solzan2000> atpRtsd
[2:39:02] <+0neReeler> damn
[2:39:02] <%holydeviant1> (He steals some of your runes if you die there.)
[2:39:02] <%radiorosewater> voice was the same
[2:39:03] <+DirtyMerlin> NotLikeThis
[2:39:06] <BlackermanZX> cant donkey kong the jump
[2:39:07] <Happy_D_> lol, I thought it was Patches
[2:39:08] <+0neReeler> should've known
[2:39:08] <lyzejag> Same voice right ?
[2:39:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie:0 Rafters: 4
[2:39:12] <+Inqy833> What a dastard
[2:39:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Any% of this game are gonna be amazing]
[2:39:13] <KingOfTheGeats> didn't know he stole your souls
[2:39:13] <klooswep> Torrent never taught us how to double jump
[2:39:13] <@DashXero> It was? Excuse me. I have someone to take care of...
[2:39:15] <%Ashenik1> jump is fine
[2:39:17] <Undenizen> i dont think it was that guy?
[2:39:23] <%RemedyofRevenge> its VERY slight to sprint up ladders
[2:39:26] <CappuccinoGuil> I thought that guy was supposed to be this game's Patches at first, hadn't met the boy yet
[2:39:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @Undenizen it is. Has the same snarky laugh
[2:39:44] <+theoldone001> Also keep a track of your Rune count when you go back to your bloodmark
[2:39:45] <%Ashenik1> woolieMIRIN
[2:39:48] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie VS Platforming
[2:39:51] <+Arnoldoaad1> rukidding, he is who steals the runes here?
[2:39:52] <crimsonharvest> this was my experience too
[2:39:52] <%Prevot> yeah, I also thought he was the patches, just putting on a different voice
[2:39:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> damn, rafters got hands
[2:39:55] <%slipdog> what a thrill
[2:39:56] <+EXPsoon> it is 100% that guy, he hides in the bushes near the grace you rest in before you go in, creeping
[2:39:59] <sundizzle> @holydeviant1 that's actually a legacy dungeon mechanic, you lose runes every time you die. you can see the debuff in your status effects
[2:40:01] <%youngking_kush> It really is for me, unironically lol
[2:40:10] <olaksi> you know what's sorely missing in this game, maniacal NPC laughter
[2:40:10] <lyzejag> Hypest game play on Twitch
[2:40:12] <%DkLordG> hypest gameplay on Twitch
[2:40:14] <tubit> lol
[2:40:14] <jacknerik> Don't worry, half of chat comes here to argue rather than watch the stream

[2:40:26] <Ultimatefool> What a thrill...
[2:40:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now this is a good bit
[2:40:27] <%jamsbybetty> @sundizzle I don't think that's accurate
[2:40:28] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:40:31] <MyNameIsRasus> try courage
[2:40:32] <$Rafraud> Skill issue
[2:40:32] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah you're not getting in that hole no matter how much you pay for the troll tole
[2:40:33] <wqorst> Kappa
[2:40:34] <+DirtyMerlin> is anything over there?? lol
[2:40:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @Undenizen nah, he's a little thieving rat as far I've played LUL
[2:40:34] <%radiorosewater> @jacknerik very true
[2:40:34] <%Prevot> Woolive woolieVS Platiforming
[2:40:39] <Shion963> maybe just neutral jump?
[2:40:42] <klooswep> When the great songs are being sung of how Woolsworth became elden lord, I think they'll skip over this part
[2:40:44] <prime_name> insert montages here
[2:40:44] <MyNameIsRasus> "babe this never happens"
[2:40:47] <%plsunbanmyacc> i swear this never happens to me...
[2:40:53] <%Ashenik1> Woolive  woolieVS  Platiforming
[2:40:53] <+Arnoldoaad1> well, not much is happenning
[2:40:56] <%VivSquatch> I swear this never happens
[2:40:57] <+anoldtoilet> can you even land on that?
[2:40:58] <tubit> almost :)
[2:40:58] <%Prevot> giving woolie the ability to jump was a mistake
[2:40:58] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[2:40:58] <+Das_Prints> @dirtymerlin there isn’t. There’s another path nearby though.
[2:40:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh just the beam lol
[2:41:00] <user_naim> return to form
[2:41:01] <+anoldtoilet> i didnt know...
[2:41:03] <+0neReeler> take 30min to setup again
[2:41:04] <gryffinp> there's probably a better way
[2:41:04] <Shion963> almost

[2:55:51] <%youngking_kush> @mechslayer71 Fighting Banish Knights in Stormveil
[2:55:51] <Shion963> bad weapon swap hits ya
[2:55:52] <+hoenhime344> hahahaa
[2:55:53] <+Jiggisnipe> what the bow thing?
[2:55:56] <Undenizen> everyone saying Not Me is a GOD DAMN LIAR
[2:55:58] <%radiorosewater> couldnt be me nah fam
[2:56:02] <+IKilledADeadGuy> except for that one thing
[2:56:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> @mechslayer71 got in melee with a knight without realizing bow was still equipped
[2:56:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:56:11] <%Wool> Wool subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! Yay 3 years, keep being great!
[2:56:11] <MyNameIsRasus> never me nuh uh
[2:56:12] <agustorm123> I don’t use bows tho
[2:56:13] <+0neReeler> hit the lever
[2:56:13] <+JustToWatch> AND IT'LL HAPPEN TO YOU
[2:56:19] <PunkZedB> that rope texture is holding on for dear life
[2:56:19] <%BigBruthaThunda> the character's yell sounds kind of like the baby jesus bit in Woolie's outro
[2:56:21] <%slipdog> jumping down required ahead Kappa
[2:56:22] <berasite> Hold down the button to scroll to the first slot (apply to weapons and spells)
[2:56:40] <7c_nickel> hes gonna miss the grace and die, who want to take the bet?
[2:56:46] <+DirtyMerlin> did he get the chunky hammer?
[2:56:51] <+IKilledADeadGuy> forgetting I had an extra weapon equipped killed my family and my cats
[2:56:57] <Shion963> @berasite oh I thought that was only items
[2:57:01] <%youngking_kush> Yep, dont forget you can jump at all times
[2:57:07] <%youngking_kush> Levels are vertical now
[2:57:15] <+Jiggisnipe> boi that old jump was fantastic huh Kappa
[2:57:18] <%Afterman_> i think its for bow weapons
[2:57:22] <dundore77> its almost immediate
[2:57:24] <+segmentedfool> Drawstring is for bow weapons
[2:57:33] <Undenizen> i hope someone makes a mod to make the jumps shitty again
[2:57:35] <+segmentedfool> also after 100 hours I have like 4 pieces of string
[2:57:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> I thought it was just the faster, shorter duration one
[2:57:44] <+Grayhammatter> no, it's fast grease
[2:57:45] <+SammyOVision> One guy
[2:57:46] <%slipdog> drawstring applies it instantly
[2:57:46] <7c_nickel> dont lie to woolie
[2:57:48] <olaksi> @youngking_kush you don't so much explore dungeons as fall through them in increasingly creative ways
[2:57:50] <MyNameIsRasus> jump button is a god send, though they need to balance jump attacks
[2:57:51] <dundore77> no drawstringer is the fast fire to weapon
[2:57:51] <+AyupaPupa> it's not for bows
[2:57:53] <+POUND_CAKE94> one guy
[2:57:54] <%Prevot> wait its for bows? the description doesn't say anything about it
[2:57:54] <JeoDood> kill the goblins gives string
[2:57:54] <%holydeviant1> It... is the faster one. What are these bow idiots talking about
[2:57:54] <+AnIrishPapaya> blind
[2:57:56] <%Majkir> It lights faster but lasts a shorter time.
[2:58:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah yes, one guy
[2:58:01] <%slipdog> liar detected ahead
[2:58:03] <%RemedyofRevenge> woolie you were right
[2:58:03] <7c_nickel> how does he see the single liar in chat?
[2:58:06] <Johannen> its for grease and fast bombs i think
[2:58:06] <%Afterman_> oh never mind
[2:58:06] <+Brassnarwhal> oneguys in here who haven't played making shit up, it's fast grease not bow grease
[2:58:09] <%Afterman_> im dumb
[2:58:09] <+SammyOVision> Liar ahead
[2:58:12] <%MajorCrasher> I've used it on regular weapons too
[2:58:15] <%slipdog> your reading was correct WoolieVersus liar detected ahead
[2:58:16] <RedBlossomail> it is not for the bow LUL
[2:58:17] <%youngking_kush> "Liar ahead" lmao
[2:58:17] <Rexols> its for all weapons
[2:58:18] <buerdo> bow guy was dumb
[2:58:20] <+AyupaPupa> one guy
[2:58:21] <%MajorCrasher> woolieONEGUY
[2:58:21] <koolkid1208> One guy
[2:58:21] <+Grayhammatter> you got one guy'd
[2:58:23] <Shion963> one guy
[2:58:25] <%radiorosewater> why would it be called 'drawstring' if not for bows, why?
[2:58:25] <dundore77> you are correct it takes like .4 seconds to coat
[2:58:26] <%Afterman_> my mind assumed string=bowstring
[2:58:26] <+POUND_CAKE94> SeemsGood
[2:58:26] <user_naim> ”Sleeping soundly after spreading misinformation”
[2:58:26] <+tuchpi> liar ahead
[2:58:27] <azreal30> "but with a brief effect"
[2:58:29] <SethYuikora> lets you apply your grease mid-swing with minimal downtime
[2:58:31] <+segmentedfool> I never used grease in this game so drawstring made me assume bow
[2:58:31] <%Majkir> woolieONEGUY
[2:58:33] <MyNameIsRasus> woolie's stand allows him to always spot the one guy in chat
[2:58:40] <bleugh> liar ahead and then one guy
[2:58:45] <huskarl_zap> bringing back woolie the liar lore
[2:58:46] <%Afterman_> didnt mean to be 1 guy
[2:58:49] <%radiorosewater> nice sword homie
[2:58:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> its amazing
[2:58:53] <%holydeviant1> Please actually play the game before making definitive statements jc
[2:58:54] <%youngking_kush> This is like the main one for the castle
[2:58:55] <+IKilledADeadGuy> imagine being the One Guy
[2:58:55] <yukichocomilk> liar ahead therefore one guy ahead
[2:58:57] <+Krasmeyts> Damn, feels bad for that bloodstainman.
[2:58:58] <%CateHecate> Touch Grass
[2:58:59] <+RakishElias> Chat: has woolie gotten to the boss of this zone yet?
[2:59:01] <+Grayhammatter> touch gracehole
[2:59:02] <okramv> GRACE HOLE
[2:59:04] <%slipdog> woolieEVIL woolieVS woolieONEGUY
[2:59:05] <Johannen> Did they explore the south peninsula or was it just pure castle?
[2:59:07] <%cubbywolf> hardcore parkour
[2:59:08] <%Afterman_> i have played the game, havent used grease stuff
[2:59:10] <+Brassnarwhal> @Afterman_ a few of my friends thought the same thing, it's understandable, but if you don't know why would you volunteer the information, that's why people are mad
[2:59:21] <%MajorCrasher> @rakishelias nah just Margit
[2:59:28] <+hoenhime344> hole of grace
[2:59:33] <+Jiggisnipe> tbf they said they think not know
[2:59:43] <%youngking_kush> @rakishelias Nope
[2:59:59] <@DashXero> Okay, people, woolieONEGUY fucked up. Let's move on.
[3:00:06] <+hoenhime344> i dont think you regain sips in legacy doungeons
[3:00:07] <Undenizen> enemies are generally places to gank you from one direction. usually moving backwards through a zone is a LOT easier.
[3:00:08] <Dopamien> wonderfully Jebaited
[3:00:13] <wqorst> sips overworld only
[3:00:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> legacy dungeon?
[3:00:15] <%radiorosewater> birds
[3:00:19] <+HairyWario> Uno guy vibes
[3:00:20] <Johannen> overworld only
[3:00:25] <%Afterman_> @Brassnarwhal people getting "mad" are overreacting. i made a mistake and quickly admitted and owned up to it. i someone got legit mad at that they should look inward
[3:00:25] <disflipmat> yeah, no extra sippie sips
[3:00:35] <%youngking_kush> I dont think you get sips back in legacy dungeons, I dont remember it ever happening
[3:00:36] <%MajorCrasher> I don't think I've ever gotten sips back in one of these unless I sit down
[3:00:37] <disflipmat> These are just straight up mini Dark Souls levels
[3:00:45] <%Prevot> "mini"
[3:00:50] <%slipdog> @Afterman_ bro you need to relax
[3:00:52] <+tuchpi> EA BIG
[3:00:57] <%CateHecate> the whiff
[3:00:59] <+HairyWario> so far i only get sips back in overworld area
[3:01:02] <+DirtyMerlin> hammer?
[3:01:04] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:01:08] <%Afterman_> ? i am relaxed, but yeah lets drop it
[3:01:15] <%slipdog> dangO dangO
[3:01:24] <%devonoel> you guys are still talking about this, eh?
[3:01:25] <Dopamien> try jumping Kappa
[3:01:27] <%radiorosewater> luck =/= skill? only science knows for certain
[3:01:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Stormveil is like the size of the first  part
[3:01:36] <%Hapsam> someone put a try jumping message there
[3:01:39] <+Brassnarwhal> @Afterman_ i appreciate your point of view and you are right, but in a room full of people who know something, if you don't know for sure you can just not say it and avoid the whole situation. anyway the mods said to stop and i assume that includes this
[3:01:41] <MyNameIsRasus> of Yharnam
[3:01:43] <%slipdog> @devonoel you gotta let it go
[3:01:46] <dundore77> isn't it jump across the other platform?
[3:01:58] <@DashXero> @Brassnarwhal Drop it.
[3:02:11] <+tuchpi> LUL
[3:02:18] <MyNameIsRasus> i did not figure out how to get that item
[3:02:20] <Johannen> Reggie to the rescue
[3:02:20] <+DirtyMerlin> Clap
[3:02:25] <+silent__chief> gotta level the ranger class until you get the double jump
[3:02:26] <olaksi> jump blindness gets souls vets real bad LUL
[3:02:26] <+Krasmeyts> ReggieMethod
[3:02:29] <%Prevot> I hope instead of Elden Ring 2, they make another gamer like this but with Bloodborne aestethic
[3:02:30] <%oneimportantthing> Reggie with the eyesight
[3:02:44] <Shion963> I think I missed this
[3:02:46] <MyNameIsRasus> @Prevot Blooden Ring
[3:02:48] <+DirtyMerlin> time 4 thick
[3:02:54] <%Hapsam> Elden Born
[3:02:55] <%slipdog> i'd be surprised if this or bloodborne got a sequel
[3:02:57] <Zoxjib> chat do they know how big this game yet? PogU
[3:02:59] <%Prevot> @Prevot that sounds nasty
[3:03:00] <Johannen> I hope they make "Sekiro 2" first
[3:03:01] <%youngking_kush> @prevot I need Mech-Souls personally
[3:03:03] <MyNameIsRasus> @Hapsam That's strong
[3:03:03] <%slipdog> as 2 of my GOATs
[3:03:06] <%MajorCrasher> I hope their next game is just the surge but better
[3:03:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wonder if we will complete Stormveil today since it's a double length stream
[3:03:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19

[3:03:30] <Shion963> ah here's the hammer
[3:03:33] <+HairyWario> @MajorCrasher but then there wont be a reason to play anything else
[3:03:33] <MyNameIsRasus> B O N K
[3:03:34] <SoaringTrumpet> she's a brick house
[3:03:37] <+KingpinLarry> Not the best hammer, but it's fun

[3:04:12] <+Brassnarwhal> brick hammer is best hammer
[3:04:12] <olaksi> dual wield hammer and sickle LUL
[3:04:13] <SoaringTrumpet> gamer revolution
[3:04:14] <%TreeLeafBoi> Union Buster Buster

[3:04:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Solidus_113 with their six pairs of eyes? surely not
[3:04:17] <MyNameIsRasus> For maximum comunism scaling
[3:04:20] <Dopamien> SMOrc BOP BOP
[3:04:21] <%ozzrabbit> It’s Matt’s Silent Hill Hammer!
[3:04:29] <%slipdog> @thesw1tch idk 7 years is a long time, 8 or 9 by the time it even would come out. plus alot of the concepts in Bloodborne get re-explored in this game, its Ds4 and BB2
[3:04:35] <Shion963> is Battle Hammer paired when 2H?
[3:04:45] <+Das_Prints> Become true unga
[3:04:46] <%Prevot> sadly the wielder of the hammer became what he fought against and exploited his former comrades
[3:04:49] <+Krasmeyts> BOP SMOrc BOP
[3:04:52] <MyNameIsRasus> THERE WAS A HOLE HERE
[3:04:53] <Johannen> wut
[3:04:57] <%youngking_kush> @slipdog Oh yeah I wont spoil it but Bloodborne is literally in Elden Ring lol
[3:05:04] <Undenizen> I actually like a nice svelt warhammer. a small weight on a LONG stick does more damage than a big weight on a short one.
[3:05:07] <%youngking_kush> You just gotta find it
[3:05:08] <+RegularCore> I've seen people power stance hammers, fucked up
[3:05:11] <%slipdog> i dont even know enough to spoil, but Grafting and the blood stuff around it already giving me big vibes lol
[3:05:12] <RyuuAoi> Just got back! Reggie talking shit? hopefully! LUL
[3:05:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Shion963 if you mean like fist weapons are, no iirc

[3:05:46] <%youngking_kush> I got to an area and said "Oh okay so this is literally just Yarham"
[3:05:55] <%slipdog> hangtimeYes
[3:05:59] <%youngking_kush> Yarnham*
[3:06:06] <MyNameIsRasus> every legacy dungeon i did so far was better than the previous one
[3:06:06] <+hoenhime344> this place is "just" bolitaria
[3:06:09] <%slipdog> Yharnam* dangKEKW
[3:06:10] <MyNameIsRasus> and i did like 3
[3:06:11] <huskarl_zap> did the brick hammer get changed? I could of sworn it said a slave led a rebellion but was knighted by godrick
[3:06:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's always more
[3:06:13] <MyNameIsRasus> this game rules
[3:06:19] <Johannen> DId they confuse holes ?
[3:06:21] <aveond> ye this dungeon is boletaria on crack
[3:06:21] <%BigBruthaThunda> is this anor londo!?!?
[3:06:30] <%youngking_kush> @hoenhime344 I meant it in a good way not a bad way

[3:06:49] <dundore77> the end was were the hammer was
[3:06:50] <+hoenhime344> @youngking_kush yea sorry, ive been drinking lol
[3:06:51] <%slipdog> good work, snake!
[3:06:56] <Johannen> choke
[3:06:58] <%youngking_kush> @bigbruthathunda This is more like Undead Berg
[3:06:59] <okamiizero> It's giving me anxiety how close he was holding the torch to the barrels
[3:07:06] <%radiorosewater> but i am dumb too
[3:07:12] <Zoxjib> at this pace they probably have 180-250 hours to beat the game Kreygasm
[3:07:17] <olaksi> the level design is incredible
[3:07:18] <%BigBruthaThunda> PixelBob
[3:07:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's ok woolz this game is complicated
[3:07:23] <Undenizen> it's ok woolz. we're dumb too.

[3:07:36] <%radiorosewater> thats a message and a half
[3:07:39] <@Solidus_113> that's a detailed message
[3:07:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> I missed two entire bosses when I went through this the first time
[3:07:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's ok Woolie we're just jostling your scrote you feel
[3:07:54] <%youngking_kush> @zoxjib I will have long beat the game by then so I'm here for it lll

[3:08:08] <dundore77> im 80 hours in and still haven't found everything in this place despite trying several times to.
[3:08:13] <@DashXero> This is Chat. None of us is as dumb as all of us.

[3:12:51] <%Ashenik1> @user_naim  me too LUL

[3:13:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair exalted flesh is nice
[3:13:08] <lilikura> It's used in one of the best late game defensive items too
[3:13:16] <%slipdog> be thankful if you don't have to SeriousSloth
[3:13:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Elden Ring is the result of Miyazaki seeing no hit runs and 100% runs and taking offense
[3:13:28] <+Grayhammatter> big scraping
[3:13:43] <Lizardman0702> @mynameisrasus yeah definitely
[3:13:57] <MyNameIsRasus> it go down

[3:14:08] <+hoenhime344> here we go
[3:14:09] <MyNameIsRasus> try up but hole
[3:14:12] <Shion963> @mynameisrasus I like that you don't have to pump str/Dex to do any damage, tho
[3:14:13] <%CateHecate> scraping spear required
[3:14:19] <%slipdog> whats even the criteria for no-hit? all bosses? good fukin luck
[3:14:27] <luftraumm1> YT recommended a NoDeath run with 3h40m, is this  thing this advenced in the running cathegories?
[3:14:28] <+murphypurpdrank_> that was actually pretty sick
[3:14:33] <%TubeMan642> Did he find the magic teacher here?
[3:14:41] <%slipdog> @luftraumm1 gamers are built different man
[3:14:46] <MyNameIsRasus> @TubeMan642 hasn't gotten that far yet
[3:14:48] <%youngking_kush> @slipdog They'll probably do "No hit, any%" so not all bosses
[3:14:55] <RyuuAoi> Spells pretty strong here
[3:14:56] <+HairyWario> exile armor getting me really far
[3:14:57] <lyzejag> The world record of this game is already below 1H btw
[3:15:01] <luftraumm1> @slipdog no shit, stuff is FAST
[3:15:04] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @tubeman642 THE WHAT

[3:15:11] <%Ashenik1> woolieYE
[3:15:18] <%youngking_kush> No hit 100% Elden Ring probably won't happen for years lol
[3:15:24] <Shion963> does charged Glintblade do more damage? or is it just the delay
[3:15:28] <sporeian94> I see that Icon woolie, you've been huggin vr girls haven't ya!?
[3:15:31] <luftraumm1> @lyzejag i assume its rife with glitches?
[3:15:33] <%slipdog> just get to the ending? thats almost worse like why go so far just to not go all the way
[3:15:33] <MyNameIsRasus> @lyzejag i can buy that. i was thinking in my head what the fastest way to the ending was and you could therotically book it
[3:15:37] <slackerunchained> SOME masochist out there will definitely try to attempt a 'no-hit, ALL bosses' run, *someday* though.
[3:15:39] <+HairyWario> no hit, not skip Elden Ring run
[3:15:45] <Johannen> Elden Ring is in Australia?
[3:15:51] <yukichocomilk> @slackerunchained some happy hobb

[3:21:45] <dundore77> the path is what you make it
[3:21:45] <+TopTieramisu> miyazaki loves platforming
[3:21:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> I really dig the banished knight helm
[3:21:47] <perfect_disaster> this is where it gets crazy
[3:21:47] <slackerunchained> @hax_metatron Better lighting means the enemies can see you better, too, tho. I tested it on that hill approaching castle Stormveil with the giant and all the archers. Lighting definitely makes a difference in their aggro.
[3:21:53] <Shion963> @00% comf
[3:21:54] <%CateHecate> GAME BIG
[3:21:55] <%holydeviant1> they only get bigger
[3:21:57] <%Ashenik1> bird up
[3:21:58] <+Grayhammatter> plenty of action
[3:21:58] <+OniOniOniiii> you can crawl ALL over this stage its great
[3:22:05] <MyNameIsRasus> "this area's huge" that's the game in a quote right there
[3:22:06] <BlackermanZX> this game is insanely huge
[3:22:10] <%youngking_kush> Oh yeah, it's a castle-castle not just a level that aesthetically a castle
[3:22:13] <dan_g_v> ok, put horrible view ahead, then!
[3:22:17] <+RegularCore> your character has no head woolie
[3:22:20] <PunkZedB> alass, you are neckless, without vertebrae
[3:22:21] <%cubbywolf> do it
[3:22:23] <dan_g_v> half foot off the edge
[3:22:25] <+TopTieramisu> stormveil has so many paths
[3:22:29] <user_naim> Miyazaki, Tanimura and the design team are deranged
[3:22:30] <%DkLordG> I've been rocking it the exile torso for a while now. I love it, especially with the imp head
[3:22:33] <+Grayhammatter> plenty of ways to go 󠀀
[3:22:42] <MyNameIsRasus> imagine being this good at level design
[3:22:44] <wqorst> stormveil is kinda overwhelming tbh
[3:22:52] <dan_g_v> time to infiltration
[3:22:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> this is the part where I just had to say fuck it and pick a random direction and go, and come back later to scrape
[3:23:00] <BlackermanZX> this game will easily surpass the disco elysium episode count
[3:23:01] <%fart_bath> fart_bath subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! thou art of passing skill
[3:23:15] <+Cujom> Cujom subscribed with Prime. 
[3:23:19] <agustorm123> Parkour
[3:23:20] <%CateHecate> try hole
[3:23:26] <dan_g_v> the Tarnished one and Link would get along really well, finding ways to invade a castle in the dumbest and craziest ways possible
[3:23:31] <Shion963> god the intended paths in this game
[3:23:41] <Shion963> Anor Londo is shrinking in shame
[3:23:47] <Johannen> Woolie has no idea
[3:23:48] <%youngking_kush> @dan_g_v Now I wanna make a Link build
[3:23:51] <MyNameIsRasus> @dan_g_v they would have a pot breaking contest
[3:23:51] <+Krasmeyts> Would they be called... Storm Eagles?
[3:23:54] <%CateHecate> amazing hole ahead
[3:24:04] <luftraumm1> oh man this section is gonna take wooolie the  rest of the day
[3:24:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> or two
[3:24:15] <Johannen> @Krasmeyts Storm Hawks
[3:24:17] <Questiy> The designated jump button fucked me up at this part when I realized I could jump on almost any of these roofs
[3:24:26] <user_naim> i mean this place is fucked huge
[3:24:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:24:30] <JonOButler> @Krasmeyts Hey thats pretty good
[3:24:43] <lyzejag> This stream is going to just be Stormveill now, perfect
[3:24:48] <luftraumm1> designing this map must have been maddening
[3:24:52] <chambatron> they don't have the pocket lantern?
[3:24:56] <+Double_Tap_That> @lyzejag As it should be
[3:25:00] <luftraumm1> the amount of overlapping paths
[3:25:04] <+OniOniOniiii> ratJAM
[3:25:07] <+0neReeler> rat king
[3:25:16] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[3:25:17] <Johannen> @chambatron I think you get from peninsula, no?
[3:25:19] <luftraumm1> belt lantern would have been choice
[3:25:20] <slackerunchained> We're rats! We're rats! We're the rats!
[3:25:21] <%CateHecate> every single area in this game i am just bullshitting my way around and saying to myself "man i shouldnt even be here"
[3:25:23] <MyNameIsRasus> I LOVE how much they make you fuck around in rooftops in  this game
[3:25:25] <%wunp_fxs> only way to travel in them
[3:25:29] <+OniOniOniiii> but where is the giant rat that makes all of da rules?
[3:25:29] <+0neReeler> big castle, locked grand entrance
[3:25:32] <NeonBleu> debris
[3:25:32] <GarbageNirvana> Hey for anyone who knows do the smithing stones in the mine areas refresh at all or nah
[3:25:35] <+POUND_CAKE94> I want interviews galore from the devs on how this game came together
[3:25:36] <olaksi> overwhelmed yet
[3:25:37] <disflipmat> Man was not meant for the power of jumping
[3:25:38] <+AyupaPupa> fly8ing buttresses
[3:25:38] <+Krasmeyts> Birdboss.
[3:25:39] <+zaddyforever> “what a weird area” is the elden ring motto
[3:25:39] <lyzejag> Lmao the bloodstains
[3:25:40] <MyNameIsRasus> @CateHecate ikr? It rules
[3:25:44] <chambatron> @Johannen I think one of the santa sells it but can't remember which one
[3:25:50] <+anoldtoilet> @GarbageNirvana i dont think they do, but you can still farm the miners for drops
[3:25:58] <GarbageNirvana> cool cool
[3:25:59] <%X2Eliah> oh neat, I usueally get to this point from above the bird, not below
[3:26:00] <Shion963> @garbagenirvana nope, but you can get vendors for them
[3:26:01] <+anoldtoilet> you have to find miners bell bearings and then you can buy low level stones
[3:26:03] <MyNameIsRasus> KNIFECOCK
[3:26:03] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[3:26:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> bird online

[3:26:10] <RyuuAoi> Yeah! Woolie gets it!
[3:26:10] <+HairyWario> i just can't wait to a new game to see all the cool shit this game has
[3:26:11] <%CateHecate> Knives for feet!
[3:26:12] <%radiorosewater> birds should follow
[3:26:12] <%Double_Tap_That> Souls level design has this great feeling of "I shouldn't be here, but that's not stopping me".
[3:26:13] <badugidugi> b-b-b-bird up
[3:26:14] <+SammyOVision> I'm genuinely impressed by the amount you can bypass in just this area. It definitely accommodates a lot of potential playstyles, just in how direct you want combat.
[3:26:15] <%youngking_kush> "What a weird area" is the subtitle of the game
[3:26:15] <+0neReeler> elden ring fucks with weird areas
[3:26:16] <slackerunchained> Da boid is Jahntrahn.
[3:26:22] <PunkZedB> he's resting
[3:26:25] <perfect_disaster> fighting this bird with a short bow is fun
[3:26:31] <+HelloImTom08> those birds are like one of the most dangerous enemies in the game LUL
[3:26:32] <MyNameIsRasus> TIME FOR HEAD
[3:26:37] <Shion963> no fire, aww
[3:26:45] <Dopamien> theres an item you use to write messages??

[3:27:11] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu yeah, i should
[3:27:12] <badugidugi> behold dog wouldve been guarantee appraisal
[3:27:16] <+casy_fair> jump strikes are surprisingly effective against those birds.
[3:27:27] <+Grayhammatter> that bird don't fuck around
[3:27:28] <Johannen> @Prevot You meant he didnt press Y/Triangle this whole time? wut
[3:27:28] <Dopamien> @Shion963 I can't read FeelsBadMan
[3:27:32] <%CateHecate> now imagine on top of everything else if every dungeon was remixed depending on your time of day Kappa
[3:27:41] <Johannen> Well i guess he did miss the waypoints and grace list
[3:27:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> I left an "up, dog" message that got a handful of appraisals
[3:27:54] <MyNameIsRasus> I never found this part wtf
[3:27:54] <+0neReeler> rear, but whole
[3:27:55] <%VladVandal> yo im back, what i miss?
[3:27:57] <Shion963> @dopamien to be fair tho the messages menu is super convenient
[3:27:57] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Seems sus

[3:29:40] <+anoldtoilet> there are a LOT of paths
[3:29:42] <+anoldtoilet> this is a BIG level
[3:29:43] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[3:29:44] <+Grayhammatter> yep, plenty of that
[3:29:45] <%slipdog> i love walking up to a fog door and its just "no joy ahead" "no hope ahead" sulking emote
[3:29:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> oh look a ramp
[3:29:51] <+TopTieramisu> flying animals are actually worse than dogs in this game
[3:29:54] <@Solidus_113> funnel the funnels
[3:29:55] <%Ashenik1> anti air defence is here
[3:30:05] <RyuuAoi> @dopamien Timberland

[3:30:27] <+Jaromero435> big place
[3:30:36] <%Ashenik1> big castle
[3:30:38] <%Ashenik1> big game
[3:30:40] <%Prevot> @TopTieramisu rats and dogs are still more common tho
[3:30:40] <luftraumm1> Elden Chunneling
[3:30:42] <%Ashenik1> big fun
[3:30:42] <%X2Eliah> yeah first time through stormveil itself can easily be some 4 hrs
[3:30:44] <+SoeSpooky> they designed a whole ass castle
[3:30:56] <+bluedude153> this area is a looping rats nest you will have to backtrack no mater what
[3:30:58] <NBUsagi> They designed multiple whole ass castles
[3:30:59] <SoaringTrumpet> I missed several places in this castle, had to return later to get some important items
[3:31:00] <olaksi> ugh adding a map is going to make a souls game way too simple to navigate /s
[3:31:13] <+0neReeler> backturn attacks?
[3:31:13] <+aram909> there are like 6 different paths through this castle all leading to vastly different areas
[3:31:14] <%slipdog> birds, bats and mosquitos make me thankful im a lightning bolt slinger lmao
[3:31:15] <+aram909> its a spiderweb
[3:31:15] <+anoldtoilet> @olaksi its so funny
[3:31:15] <user_naim> ”and then, uhh…” is on point for this place
[3:31:18] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu rats aren't that big a problem
[3:31:20] <+anoldtoilet> the map even lies sometimes
[3:31:23] <+aram909> this castle is huge
[3:31:25] <%Prevot> look at that heal
[3:31:26] <+Krasmeyts> Claw Talisman is the real prize here, in my opinion. I still use the Claw Tali and Ravencloak 140 hours in.
[3:31:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[3:31:29] <%Prevot> so good
[3:31:30] <+anoldtoilet> its like not a 1 to 1 accurate map even
[3:31:35] <RyuuAoi> Now you're playing with power, Woolie!
[3:31:36] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu dogs are also not that bad either
[3:31:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> which one is Claw again?
[3:31:40] <+aram909> its the first time in the game where i was like "i wish the map was better"
[3:31:51] <+Krasmeyts> Claw enhances jumpstrikes
[3:31:52] <+HefestoForges> @aWanderingKaivo jump attack enhancement
[3:31:54] <%X2Eliah> claw was jump attack buff,, right
[3:32:04] <@DashXero> I never saw that guy in the corner.
[3:32:06] <+HefestoForges> doot
[3:32:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah nifty
[3:32:09] <+alextheblight> toot toot
[3:32:11] <squirtkitten> @TopTieramisu they still teleport off screen and turn into a giant hitbox while walking towards you tho and can stagger stunlock
[3:32:14] <+anoldtoilet> fguck yes
[3:32:16] <RyuuAoi> Da fuq ha
[3:32:16] <%Ashenik1> nice
[3:32:17] <%Prevot> @aram909 nah map is fine, you're not supposed to have a map indoors

[3:32:38] <@Solidus_113> good the whole game
[3:32:40] <stevenellis386> hate these type of enemies who sound the alarms! You kill those dudes first!
[3:32:47] <%youngking_kush> @solidus_113 Facts
[3:32:47] <%slipdog> Moonlight sword mobile
[3:32:52] <+anoldtoilet> yeah glintstone arc is one of the best AOEs in the entire game
[3:32:55] <%CateHecate> at this rate woolie wont even need a katana to be doing vergil specials
[3:32:55] <KaiserMario> no...
[3:32:59] <+solzan2000> you would have died in DS lol
[3:33:07] <+anoldtoilet> even late game when you have more damaging ones, arc is usually still faster
[3:33:07] <+aram909> @aram909 i wish i had a proper one indoors though stormveil is bigger than any of the areas/dungeons in any of the previous souls games
[3:33:16] <perfect_disaster> stif

[3:35:55] <@Solidus_113> speeeen
[3:35:59] <%RemedyofRevenge> these knights have a MASSIVE codpiece
[3:36:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> halberd man is no joke, he inspired me to go for a halberd build
[3:36:01] <+anoldtoilet> yeah these storm knights are badasses

[3:36:19] <MrLetap> Gotta use your ultimate move more. Its Op
[3:36:20] <NBUsagi> What dope is you can get their wind powers as weapon arts
[3:36:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it took ages for these knights to start dropping their armor in my game
[3:36:29] <QueequegTheater> Oh man Woolie's HP is low
[3:36:30] <+BlandSpice> The talisman going off looks like getting a sip.
[3:36:32] <Johannen> that talisman is godlike
[3:36:39] <slackerunchained> "Roberrrrrrrt~!"
[3:36:44] <RyuuAoi> Talisman prolly
[3:36:46] <%hax_metatron> It's the talisman
[3:36:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> good timing

[3:36:52] <+POUND_CAKE94> Thx for the stream to help me through a busy day bros
[3:36:53] <%VladVandal> MrLetap bloodhounds finesse has carried me through many am encounter
[3:36:59] <+aram909> @Solidus_113 the banished knight helmet looks cool on the enemy but honestly i havent found an armor set to go with it that doesnt look goofy and dumb
[3:37:04] <%youngking_kush> Dont be shy on using your weapon art, they're re-tuned here so you can use them more and they do BIG stance damage
[3:37:07] <%X2Eliah> correct
[3:37:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> @NBUsagi I really like the wind projectile one that the exiles use, gives you a magic ranged attack on a quality build
[3:37:16] <%Prevot> I've got sooo many message upvotes, but almost never when I need it
[3:37:21] <Dopamien> I think its just in the overworld you get sips back
[3:37:28] <%youngking_kush> I say that because DS3 trained me to use it sparingly
[3:37:28] <+anoldtoilet> the bloodhound weapon art is so strong it continued to surprise me even when i knew how strong it was
[3:37:37] <+POUND_CAKE94> The longsword's thrust weapon art move got me through the first 10 hrs
[3:37:40] <%youngking_kush> But Elden Ring is the opposite
[3:37:45] <NBUsagi> @NBUsagi Yeah they really put love into this game so that even if you are like a hard line melee build you always have a cool option with weapon arts to fill in your gaps
[3:37:48] <RyuuAoi> Shield up
[3:37:48] <%Ashenik1> @aram909  so you are playing the game naked this whole time I presume Hmmm

[3:46:08] <+solzan2000> birrd got knocked the F out
[3:46:15] <+0neReeler> apex predator
[3:46:21] <hellhound123123> They can also blow each other up if you can get the timing on the barrels
[3:46:22] <NBUsagi> RULES OF NATURE
[3:46:24] <+NottaAlotta> Woolz, you can skip the birds by jumping down to the right
[3:46:24] <+TopTieramisu> bats suck too
[3:46:30] <%radiorosewater> barrel bird
[3:46:37] <%Prevot> flying Ai still not that great
[3:46:38] <%JetpackMcQuack> Cheeky
[3:46:39] <MyNameIsRasus> @NottaAlotta ON GOD?
[3:46:41] <stevenellis386> I would try blowing up the barrels
[3:46:50] <+NottaAlotta> @NottaAlotta 100%
[3:46:52] <%slipdog> he got millia pressure
[3:46:54] <%Ashenik1> will From ever run out of ideas for enemies?!
[3:46:57] <Johannen> Birb got cross ups
[3:46:59] <perfect_disaster> @NottaAlotta you can WHAT?
[3:46:59] <Dopamien> @NottaAlotta and skip content? noidontthinkso
[3:47:06] <luftraumm1> seems like woolie is consistently going for the block counter on the wrong hit
[3:47:13] <%youngking_kush> @ashenik1 After what I've seen in this game, hell no
[3:47:25] <IronGlorfindel> god, I love that you can just make items
[3:47:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[3:47:30] <luftraumm1> this balcony is BS
[3:47:32] <%tempestzephyr> :)
[3:47:33] <%youngking_kush> You would think they'd be scraping the bottom of the barrel by now, but no
[3:47:33] <%JetpackMcQuack> Flight is a problem
[3:47:33] <+TopTieramisu> block counter has a lot of drawbacks
[3:47:34] <tubit> :)
[3:47:34] <+ScatFace> fromsoft still has some enemies they didn't use from berserk
[3:47:41] <%slipdog> :D
[3:47:42] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus its the Weather system
[3:47:43] <+aram909> @luftraumm1 to be fair, some enemies have such long attack chains/combos that its hard to tell when is safe to get a hint or block counter in
[3:47:47] <KnightAsteran> @ScatFace when schnozz?
[3:47:48] <MyNameIsRasus> @ScatFace LUL
[3:47:51] <+aram909> i wish block counter had more super armor
[3:47:52] <tubit> lol
[3:47:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> :) :)
[3:47:53] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:47:55] <%Ashenik1> @youngking_kush  and the new dogs are the shit!
[3:47:59] <NBUsagi> Just speaking it into existence now
[3:47:59] <+solzan2000> LUL
[3:48:00] <hellhound123123> Woolie can jump down that ledge on the left
[3:48:05] <luftraumm1> @aram909 you're absolutely right too
[3:48:09] <%Anaguma_no_Koe> damn, no fried chicken
[3:48:09] <perfect_disaster> feel it Kreygasm
[3:48:10] <+solzan2000> these birds are od
[3:48:16] <+FlappySeal_> Even after finishing the game, these birds can politely fuck right off :'D
[3:48:18] <tubit> respect the birb
[3:48:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> block counter is best with barricade shield, makes enemy attacks bounce off more
[3:48:20] <user_naim> in the air tonight
[3:48:22] <%slipdog> yeah the stagger part of the guard counter mechanic isnt explained in game, but it depends on your guard bonus stat and the strength of the attack, whether they 2handed, etc.
[3:48:29] <%radiorosewater> oh my god this camera
[3:48:29] <%youngking_kush> @ashenik1 There's an enemy type in this game that made me feel the most uncomfortable I have ever felt playing a game, horror games included
[3:48:37] <+Finnmac5> The Souls-Sense TM popping off
[3:48:38] <+lotuslope> @WoolieVersus do you know you have a max hp debuff?
[3:48:40] <%youngking_kush> Fucking nightmare fuel
[3:48:49] <luftraumm1> oh pat is coming online
[3:48:50] <+Krasmeyts> @stinkbuggy01 you mean like 10? yeh that makes sense.
[3:48:58] <+anoldtoilet> enemies are almost always plus on block
[3:49:01] <hellhound123123> @WoolieVersus you can jump down that balcony where the bird came from for a fun time
[3:49:07] <+segmentedfool> Does woolie have the 5% hp debuff
[3:49:07] <Dopamien> @youngking_kush which one? be as vague as possible lol
[3:49:09] <SaintBeau> bell

[3:49:17] <+Rygaklu> bell-evator
[3:49:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> do a flip
[3:49:23] <%Ashenik1> @youngking_kush ever since bloodborne, they cannot stop with horror
[3:49:24] <%youngking_kush> @dopamien They've got hands
[3:49:26] <stevenellis386> I DARE YOU
[3:49:26] <Johannen> @lotuslope I wonder if he ever connects that and again be pissed like rice that its leads to stuff
[3:49:30] <jacknerik> Wrong game

[3:52:49] <+Fefe41> If you're not a dick in a souls game you're cool in my book
[3:52:52] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ash of War not spells
[3:52:52] <%BestTeaMaker> here we go
[3:52:56] <%hax_metatron> SCALING IS INSANE ON THAT COMBO
[3:52:56] <%youngking_kush> YOU CAN PUT A SPELL ON A SWORD
[3:53:01] <BlackermanZX> oh its an Ash of War
[3:53:02] <linSP> spellsword

[3:53:32] <rustybuckethead21> SPIN TO WIN!!!
[3:53:32] <+redbeast4u> oh shit... this is a "weapon art"!
[3:53:38] <crimsonharvest> apply bleed real fast maybe?
[3:53:38] <PunkZedB> it's the Star Wars Rebels move
[3:53:38] <+solzan2000> Falke move
[3:53:40] <@Irridium> the ol' General Grevious
[3:53:41] <+AnIrishPapaya> General Grevious time
[3:53:42] <+Arnoldoaad1> it does block
[3:53:45] <@Solidus_113> it's not great
[3:53:46] <ThePayphone> behind the scenes detail: the devs of the souls series gives hints to the player that patches cannot be trusted by making him british
[3:53:46] <huskarl_zap> general kenobi
[3:53:47] <FrostedZaibatsu> I dont approve of playing a game you paid for woolieFROG
[3:53:50] <+Proxzo> Try Spinning, That's a good trick.
[3:53:51] <stevenellis386> a skill employed by princesses?!
[3:53:52] <%youngking_kush> It also blocks!
[3:53:57] <%okuriskyles> duel of the fates just playing in my mind
[3:53:58] <huskarl_zap> @thepayphone this
[3:53:59] <+AnIrishPapaya> @huskarl_zap LUL
[3:54:00] <+azraith> I think all that stuff turns a weapon into magic scaling too\
[3:54:00] <+JT_Jag> spin weapon entirely for poise damage
[3:54:02] <JonOButler> vergil princess?
[3:54:05] <+mechslayer71> they attack
[3:54:06] <genmypoweralready> It acts as a shield as well
[3:54:06] <+azraith> int scaling, rather
[3:54:08] <%BestTeaMaker> get fucked is what happens
[3:54:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> Find a safe little nook to pop that off and go
[3:54:11] <BlackermanZX> So its the spells you have bu in ash form?
[3:54:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ThePayphone csbeastSetIn  bri'ish csbeastSetIn
[3:54:13] <genmypoweralready> A shitty shield but a shield. Projectile shield
[3:54:14] <+anoldtoilet> @stevenellis386 the carian royal family are all sword mages
[3:54:15] <+anoldtoilet> its cool
[3:54:16] <+ScatFace> that's how I got a dead npc
[3:54:29] <%hax_metatron> Leave a map marker here
[3:54:32] <+Fefe41> Patches has never lied though
[3:54:36] <+Krasmeyts> enough for one art?
[3:54:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> he will move to roundtable later too
[3:54:42] <%slipdog> he lied to me
[3:54:49] <%CateHecate> when u walkin marker
[3:54:55] <+ScatFace> hostile enemy attacked an npc then the npc got cross fire from sorcery
[3:55:01] <%youngking_kush> @awanderingkaivo Only if you do the next part of his quest, which is in the castle
[3:55:04] <%espanishcanamurciana> Uh what I miss
[3:55:10] <%espanishcanamurciana> Oh this guy!
[3:55:13] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You wont be able to use those on your sword
[3:55:17] <Johannen> yeah
[3:55:17] <+anoldtoilet> @BlackermanZX most of the spell ashes of war are slightly different from the spell versions. greatsword ash is a vertical slash and spell is a horizontal aoe, some other things have unique follow ups
[3:55:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> WAAANT
[3:55:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> @youngking_kush I missed him entirely and he showed up after godrick /shrug
[3:55:27] <%youngking_kush> Or actually, I think he does go there first THEN you find the next step in the castle
[3:55:39] <BlackermanZX> Well thats sick
[3:55:48] <%Ashenik1> Guys, what is the best mix for colossal swords? I have been thiniking about this dragon stuff.
[3:55:57] <+V_S_Hokaru> Rogier, ye know anything of Basilisks?
[3:55:57] <+kungfauxboi> spin
[3:55:57] <jam_chamoy> spin is good
[3:56:02] <%hax_metatron> Pebble + R2 is crazy scaling
[3:56:04] <%youngking_kush> Yeah, now that I think about you do gotta 5alk to him at the Hold after this
[3:56:04] <@Solidus_113> they all are
[3:56:06] <Johannen> you cant replace it
[3:56:12] <+Proxzo> Steel Ball Run
[3:56:23] <+Sir_Louis> time for SPIN MOVE
[3:56:24] <urkleturtle> Let's take it for a spin
[3:56:26] <%slipdog> dang he has lore
[3:56:28] <BlackermanZX> can you even put these on your current sword
[3:56:30] <huskarl_zap> The cuck academy
[3:56:41] <%wunp_fxs> is he a ff14 va? sounds like it...i think
[3:56:46] <%BestTeaMaker> @huskarl_zap we get it you don't like magic, shut up
[3:56:48] <Johannen> cant swap out ashes of war on uniques
[3:56:51] <%CateHecate> interesting Kappa
[3:56:52] <%hax_metatron> Capitalism?
[3:56:53] <@Solidus_113> also yeah your sword is a special art @WoolieVersus
[3:56:59] <@Solidus_113> can't change it
[3:57:03] <MyNameIsRasus> i'm like 70 hours in and i still don't know what the golden order is
[3:57:05] <+Krasmeyts> @huskarl_zap ironically, Rennala got cucked pretty hard.
[3:57:10] <%slipdog> at least 2 establishments of magic confirmed Kreygasm
[3:57:15] <%ChoculaUltra> Rogier dropping knowledge
[3:57:22] <%espanishcanamurciana> Raya Lucaria aka the church of the choir
[3:57:25] <BigYanno> looks like there's a lot of north. That's not a very helpful direction to be given
[3:57:26] <+Huderga> -north of the caste- looks west
[3:57:28] <huskarl_zap> @bestteamaker nah it's just that it's called cuckoo everything LUL
[3:57:31] <%youngking_kush> @mynameisrasus From what I gather it's essentially the Laws of Physics of this world
[3:57:32] <+aram909> or even less
[3:57:34] <+aram909> this game is MASSIVE
[3:57:35] <user_naim> lot of magic to throw around
[3:57:38] <dundore77> they need a chat log
[3:57:43] <+tuchpi> @Huderga east? LUL
[3:57:44] <%hax_metatron> Golden order was pliable enough to adapt practices which oppose it
[3:57:45] <bippityjones> The Golden Order was adaptable enough to accept things that contradicted it
[3:57:47] <@DashXero> Pliable enough to absorb shit that contradicted it.
[3:57:56] <+anoldtoilet> @Huderga LUL
[3:58:01] <QueequegTheater> @huskarl_zap They're literally called cuckoo knights
[3:58:13] <%ChoculaUltra> "hey that sounds rad, write that down" - the golden order, probably
[3:58:15] <+eanscrale> They were open to pluralism basically
[3:58:15] <+anoldtoilet> its because he was already at Sellia Town of Sorcery and its surprising for thre to be multiple sorcery zones
[3:58:20] <bippityjones> I like how chat has three different interpretations
[3:58:20] <BlackermanZX> who would join the cuck knights
[3:58:27] <user_naim> syncretic belief systems are a lot more tempting when they come with superpowers and sick weapon arts
[3:58:29] <+TopTieramisu> disappointed in these fake ladders
[3:58:37] <+TopTieramisu> stepladders
[3:58:44] <%slipdog> that glintstone kinda nice ngl
[3:58:54] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i need to rescrape stormveil so bad lol
[3:58:54] <BigYanno> I've seen so many phantoms of people using this sword
[3:58:57] <slackerunchained> @BlackermanZX Some knights are into that. Don't kinkshame.
[3:58:57] <+anoldtoilet> @bippityjones its cool, this game has lore that is more immediately accessible, but the real answers seem as hard to find as ever
[3:59:01] <huskarl_zap> @queequegtheater yes cuckoo everything gives me the right to post CUCK in all caps all the time LUL
[3:59:16] <%youngking_kush> @bigyanno Its very strong early game
[3:59:24] <ThePayphone> @Huderga they shoulda said stern, so that he doesnt look starboard
[3:59:25] <%slipdog> bloodhounds fang is the black knight sword of er
[3:59:26] <%youngking_kush> Like right out the box
[3:59:30] <+TopTieramisu> oh god, lore talk makes me think of the subreddit thread
[3:59:33] <+TopTieramisu> what a headache
[3:59:36] <Johannen> Could you drop the Bell on that to break the floor?
[3:59:37] <+Fefe41> @bippityjones Until Vaati makes a lore video and then everyone becomes an expert with the same views
[3:59:41] <BigYanno> he heard you slam your sword on the ground
[3:59:55] <%Prevot> that assist tho
[3:59:56] <SoaringTrumpet> that damn torch guy

[4:00:22] <jacknerik> Rip runes
[4:00:22] <hellhound123123> LUL
[4:00:23] <gulthrax> aggresive cod piece
[4:00:23] <BlackermanZX> rolled into a corner
[4:00:24] <+aram909> woolie you can JUMP
[4:00:25] <wqorst> pushed into a locker
[4:00:25] <SoaringTrumpet> the flank was real
[4:00:26] <+yeknomlive> they did some mvc assists there
[4:00:27] <+duckmeat_woohoo> Holy crap, I hadn't seen that before
[4:00:30] <%youngking_kush> @fefe41 I dont think its gonna be that way this time, cuz the lore is alot more concrete thanks to GRRM. Alot less ethereal & enigmatic
[4:00:30] <%Prevot> perfectly coordinated
[4:00:32] <+Krasmeyts> R-Rogier? Wanna help a brotha out?
[4:00:35] <+anoldtoilet> @aram909 i forget this ALL THE TIME also
[4:00:35] <user_naim> why are these guys so competent?
[4:00:35] <MyNameIsRasus> these two are a fuck
[4:00:35] <+JT_Jag> That dude rushed you down like a Sol main
[4:00:37] <+swesterly> love getting body blocked into a corner
[4:00:38] <%tempestzephyr> bulge
[4:00:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> Did he taunt?
[4:00:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> these guys played 2s arena in WoW
[4:00:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> 2 dudes in a room = RIP
[4:00:47] <BigYanno> maybe a guard counter could have got him out, but I doubt it
[4:00:51] <+anoldtoilet> @youngking_kush i disagree a bit
[4:00:55] <agustorm123> The Owl strat
[4:00:56] <QueequegTheater> Rogier was intimidated by the codpiece
[4:00:57] <huskarl_zap> he smelled the cuck magic and drew swords
[4:00:57] <hellhound123123> Go down the balcony where the second set of birds comes from
[4:00:59] <+Huderga> fuck with the skill while you're near a grace
[4:01:03] <+AnIrishPapaya> ash of war time?
[4:01:12] <Johannen> i you dont have the right
[4:01:14] <+anoldtoilet> the basic stuff sure but i still have no idea what the fingers are about or why theyre fingers. or if theyre fingers
[4:01:24] <+Finnmac5> Boss weapons cant have ash of war replaced
[4:01:33] <+Huderga> short sword
[4:01:35] <%slipdog> @anoldtoilet its all told pretty explicitly in the main story, pretty early on
[4:01:36] <+Krasmeyts> Bloodhound gang will accept no ashes.
[4:01:42] <+AnIrishPapaya> you just saw it
[4:01:47] <+aWanderingKaivo> as far as lore goes I just wanna say I dig 'The Greater Will" as a term
[4:01:50] <+JT_Jag> Solemn Smithing Stone weapons cannot be enhanced at all yeah
[4:02:00] <+TopTieramisu> what's the weebiest weapon in this game that's NOT a katana?
[4:02:03] <%youngking_kush> @anoldtoilet Its a tough conversation to have because there's a good chance with I've done in the game I have more context than alot of people
[4:02:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> there is a naginata
[4:02:10] <huskarl_zap> @toptieramisu the naginata
[4:02:15] <+TopTieramisu> ok, that's cheating
[4:02:21] <+TopTieramisu> a non-japanese weapon
[4:02:28] <%youngking_kush> Not just how far I am but like, with the quests I've done and item I've got and shit like that
[4:02:30] <+JT_Jag> listen, a katana at the tip of a spear is totally different than just a katana
[4:02:35] <nintega010> @toptieramisu guts sword
[4:02:37] <+tuchpi> spinning + bleed Kreygasm
[4:02:37] <gulthrax> Goochigatana
[4:02:44] <+Krasmeyts> @TopTieramisu you can use the flower bouquet from the DMC2 commercial...
[4:02:49] <NBUsagi> Here we go, Woolie continues the Virgil path
[4:02:50] <+anoldtoilet> @anoldtoilet yeah but this is a from soft game and trhey could be lying
[4:02:54] <%notsoy> uh, the naginata is extremely Japanese idk wtf you're talking about
[4:02:54] <PepperJam_Art> @jt_jag there's also a wakizashi, the small katana
[4:02:57] <huskarl_zap> it begins
[4:03:05] <stevenellis386> YOSHI
[4:03:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> speeeeeeeeeeen
[4:03:07] <%RyTYoung> YEYEYE
[4:03:07] <@Solidus_113> Vergil block
[4:03:09] <+FadingEmber> oh boy magic katanas....
[4:03:10] <+anoldtoilet> epic
[4:03:11] <+TopTieramisu> @notsoy yeah, that's why i added a new addendum
[4:03:12] <karawra> spin to win
[4:03:12] <+Finnmac5> That paired with bleed tho
[4:03:19] <%RyTYoung> Where did they pick up the magic uchi from?
[4:03:20] <%SirGO0SE> Speen :)
[4:03:20] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:03:20] <BlackermanZX> one step closer to being Vergil
[4:03:21] <%slipdog> no D
[4:03:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> will it blend?
[4:03:24] <+Das_Prints> Wish you could walk forward with it.
[4:03:25] <johnny_scissors> yooo woolie made a magic katana let's go
[4:03:29] <+JT_Jag> So yeah the spin to win does next to no damage
[4:03:30] <+Das_Prints> Ah tnevermond
[4:03:32] <genmypoweralready> It's good for stagger
[4:03:33] <+JT_Jag> it's all for poise
[4:03:35] <stevenellis386> YOSHI LETSGO
[4:03:35] <+Das_Prints> Nevermind*
[4:03:37] <tolloponik> if upgraded to 3 that might kill
[4:03:38] <Johannen> gotta upgrade
[4:03:40] <%hax_metatron> Defense
[4:03:43] <+Javaa01> Yeah that spin does garbage posture damage
[4:03:43] <%youngking_kush> It's better on a stagf
[4:03:43] <dan_g_v> bleed damage?
[4:03:43] <johnny_scissors> there are some good int ashes of war too
[4:03:46] <+ScatFace> greatsword and pebble are better
[4:03:50] <+anoldtoilet> yeah weapon art damage scales with upgrades not your stats
[4:03:50] <dan_g_v> put some rot or bleed?
[4:03:52] <%slipdog> its more for utility than damage
[4:03:52] <+anoldtoilet> its weird
[4:03:52] <+JT_Jag> spin weapon is mostly just an easy way to magic enhance a weapon
[4:03:56] <+Javaa01> The basic 3 hit magic spell breaks those birds poise
[4:04:03] <%tempestzephyr> does it build status ailments?
[4:04:06] <+segmentedfool> The glintstone greatsword ash is way better
[4:04:06] <IronGlorfindel> I mean, it *is* a +0 Katana
[4:04:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> pebble and phalanx are cool with the followup lunge
[4:04:22] <+ScatFace> you can use magic aliment with keen skills anyways
[4:04:38] <%youngking_kush> !uptime
[4:04:38] <@Moobot> @youngking_kush WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 12 minutes
[4:04:48] <Johannen> yeah, considering the area gives large stones you should have +3 weapon
[4:04:54] <iacus_> arrived late today
[4:05:09] <%slipdog> storm arrows? hangtimeYes
[4:05:11] <iacus_> ah nice. stormveil
[4:05:34] <+TopTieramisu> WARHAX
[4:05:36] <Pudgy_Pidgey> That's a drop!?
[4:05:42] <%youngking_kush> I dual wield swords with that on my left hand
[4:05:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh dang I didn't know they dropped the bird blades
[4:05:50] <+Solidarity_> didn't know those dropped a blade nice
[4:05:52] <+TopTieramisu> i'm definitely a dual wield boy now
[4:05:54] <+segmentedfool> Time to go farm warhawks I guess
[4:05:54] <+Das_Prints> Eyy lucky!
[4:06:02] <%JetpackMcQuack> Become a warhawk
[4:06:15] <+anoldtoilet> unique moveset
[4:06:15] <%JetpackMcQuack> Tie them to your shoes
[4:06:16] <%slipdog> its dex/str and you're kinda int. if you make it magic i bet it fucks
[4:06:19] <+anoldtoilet> charge both hits
[4:06:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh I like the R2s for style points on it
[4:06:19] <+crocodile_t34rz> I want to shake the hand of the person who came up with the idea to strap knives to the feet of birds
[4:06:20] <jam_chamoy> oh wow they drop a weapon
[4:06:21] <+Arnoldoaad1> thats arare drop
[4:06:22] <iacus_> do a Raiden
[4:06:25] <Johannen> Dual wielding those must be cool
[4:06:36] <%slipdog> i'm about to go get two of those rq
[4:06:37] <+anoldtoilet> crouch stab is good
[4:06:39] <%RemedyofRevenge> @WoolieVersus try wielding it with another straight sword for power stance
[4:06:42] <iacus_> looks  cool at least
[4:06:51] <iacus_> how does the skill look?
[4:07:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> Twin swords are back
[4:07:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:07:33] <%youngking_kush> Jumping L1 when dual wield is VERY strong
[4:07:40] <%slipdog> you also get a crouching, jumping and running L1 so OD
[4:07:46] <%slipdog> and backstep L1
[4:07:50] <+Fefe41> Is there actually any advantage doing a cross slash irl beside looking rad as shit
[4:08:02] <+ScatFace> power stance has never been this good
[4:08:04] <+TopTieramisu> if you're dealing status effects, dual wielding is so nice
[4:08:07] <hellhound123123> You can get an art of war by jumping off that balcony
[4:08:08] <iacus_> I've always played these games sword+board lol. Should try other styles too
[4:08:14] <BreakfastSampler> @Fefe41 there's no advantage to doing so, so, so many things
[4:08:18] <+eanscrale> @Fefe41 no it's super impractical
[4:08:24] <+aaymon86> So many ways to play. All viable and fun.
[4:08:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> Real sword fights suck
[4:08:35] <%slipdog> theres no practical reason to even have a sword irl lol
[4:08:44] <+TopTieramisu> i find shield can be stifling with your reaction time and learning of movesets
[4:08:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> @iacus_ sword and board at least has new toys this time around with the guard counters, items that enhance it, new shield skills etc
[4:08:56] <%youngking_kush> Yeah IRL spears are the way2go
[4:08:58] <+thefancywig> rainbow stones more useful than they've ever been
[4:09:07] <+TopTieramisu> swords are like sidearms in old times
[4:09:10] <user_naim> @toptieramisu plus learning  the stamina management can get distracting
[4:09:10] <+anoldtoilet> even when swords were big, it technically wasnt the most practical weapon and spears were more common. if you had a sword you were like speciufically trying to show off and be a cool guy
[4:09:10] <+TopTieramisu> they're not the main weapons
[4:09:10] <NBUsagi> There are also some hella unique shields with weapon arts too
[4:09:11] <+Finnmac5> You dont get swings. So dont have the fight happen there lmao
[4:09:18] <Johannen> The symbol dissapeared once he came inside
[4:09:23] <Dopamien> it would probably go arrows > spear > mace before swords lol
[4:09:28] <iacus_> he smart
[4:09:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> BRO
[4:09:36] <iacus_> whoa
[4:09:36] <+TopTieramisu> LMAO

[4:10:01] <%DapperCadavr> these guys rock
[4:10:02] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie trying to outfootsie DIAGO AGAIN
[4:10:07] <hellhound123123> Welcome to this game's black knights lol
[4:10:12] <+eanscrale> so much for zoning
[4:10:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> I have never seen this dude fucking drift out a building lmao
[4:10:16] <iacus_> this guy so so annoying too
[4:10:25] <%RyTYoung> Having the stamina bar being longer than the health bar is definitely a sin
[4:10:26] <user_naim> Woolie versus an actual airbender
[4:10:29] <T_Sasquatch> @hellhound123123 arent crucible knightsthe new ones
[4:10:33] <%slipdog> you get one if youre lucky woolieMIRIN
[4:10:34] <+darkfoxxs> How you survive that
[4:10:42] <%slipdog> greatsword probs
[4:10:47] <%CateHecate> THIS DUDE FOR SAMSHO
[4:10:47] <disflipmat> These guys made me give up on Stormveil for several hours
[4:10:49] <%RyTYoung> Roll that and that and that and that
[4:10:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Bulge Knight wins again
[4:10:58] <dundore77> these guys only stagger for 3 maybe 4 swings
[4:11:00] <%Prevot> he's like 10% of crucible knight, respectable
[4:11:01] <MyNameIsRasus> @disflipmat Same LUL
[4:11:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> what is woolie's curved sword upgraded to?
[4:11:03] <hellhound123123> Check that codpiece son
[4:11:06] <+anoldtoilet> they need extra room for the dick
[4:11:07] <SoaringTrumpet> some backstab opportunities there for sure
[4:11:10] <%Lion_kun> Elites are for real
[4:11:14] <+ScatFace> if you want to stagger him, get a colossal weapon
[4:11:17] <+swesterly> so begins the enemies with endless stagger, combos, and roll catches
[4:11:23] <%youngking_kush> Yeah, his armor is BIG poise
[4:11:25] <QueequegTheater> Just do the guard counter
[4:11:26] <%mr_sups> https://clips.twitch.tv/EntertainingThirstyPeachArgieB8-HegYuhqJHFIwISrL
[4:11:26] <%slipdog> Woolie is attacking it strategically af woolieSMUG
[4:11:35] <+anoldtoilet> 2 handing your sword will stagger him easier but then you better be real good at rolling
[4:11:37] <+Javaa01> Or just backstab loop them into a coma like good ol DS1, but it's up to you
[4:11:53] <+AnIrishPapaya> Just wait til he fights a Crucible Knight LUL Woolie's going to have a baaad time
[4:11:55] <hellhound123123> Just guard counter the birds
[4:11:57] <+Finnmac5> Those banished knights are no joke. I died to their shields way too many times
[4:11:58] <%slipdog> and, shot
[4:11:58] <+TopTieramisu> stormveil knights got that drift tech
[4:12:00] <tolloponik> parry? Kappa
[4:12:04] <+anoldtoilet> @QueequegTheater this isnt really reliable unless you have 30+ poise or really know the openings
[4:12:05] <+ScatFace> so woolie's trying to do sword mage yeah?
[4:12:06] <velgaduere> @AnIrishPapaya already happened, already defeated
[4:12:10] <DeathByPoke7> FamilyMan
[4:12:11] <%youngking_kush> @anirishpapaya He beat the one in the Gaol already
[4:12:16] <CapCasual> @WoolieVersus 60 poise his armor set.
[4:12:22] <+anoldtoilet> these guys will just attack through your guard counter and hit you anyway
[4:12:23] <NBUsagi> He drifted around the corner like "whats up"
[4:12:31] <hellhound123123> You don't
[4:12:32] <+Finnmac5> Ya dont
[4:12:33] <%Cozy90> i dont think there is one
[4:12:34] <+TopTieramisu> the don't get riposted as far as i can tell
[4:12:37] <velgaduere> you don't always get a riposte
[4:12:37] <GingaNZ> I think its just a knockdown for flyers
[4:12:38] <+ScatFace> greatsword sword art staggers him too
[4:12:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think some enemies just don't allow you to repost, even though the noise occurs
[4:12:46] <%hax_metatron> They're too strong for natural ripostes
[4:12:47] <%slipdog> flying enemies have their own knockdown state, no riposte afaik
[4:12:48] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> SuperBloodWolfMoon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! there is nothing more hilarious to me than watching the birds pathfind for the stairs
[4:12:49] <velgaduere> sometimes it's just an opening for swings
[4:12:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> I forget if they bounce off with barricade shield or not, I was mostly using a 2h at the time
[4:12:52] <user_naim> What how much shit Kenneth talked about Godrick, this castle is pretty real
[4:13:02] <CptHarlok> I've found whips to work wonderfully vs these hawk assholes.
[4:13:16] <youngsn0w_> Does Woolie think this is better than DS2?
[4:13:20] <PepperJam_Art> @user_naim he inherited it
[4:13:26] <user_naim> @cptharlok oh right i gotta try those
[4:13:33] <VincentGraves> the halberd is such a good weapon until the treespear
[4:13:36] <+ScatFace> good luck bro
[4:13:37] <Narratorway> Watching this muted while Earthworm Jim music plays in the brackground is...a unique experience.
[4:13:41] <okamiizero> @CptHarlok I love using the whip against zombie enemies, while singing castlevania themes
[4:13:43] <PepperJam_Art> godrick's a bitch
[4:13:49] <CptHarlok> @user_naim I've been playing with dual bleed whips, and it's a riot.
[4:13:52] <user_naim> @pepperjam_art oh yeah i guess it makes sense.
[4:13:58] <Dopamien> dont tell him LUL
[4:14:12] <+TopTieramisu> @Dopamien lol....
[4:14:16] <%Lion_kun> According to lore, most of Godrick's best deserted him because they were so disgusted with his grafting. So Godrick had to fill his ranks with mercenaries and bandits.
[4:14:22] <+Solutha> buffs go away if you switch
[4:14:30] <+TopTieramisu> surely woolie should know
[4:14:33] <Dopamien> @Solutha I said dont 😡
[4:14:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:14:35] <+anoldtoilet> punching with a greatshield is so od
[4:14:41] <+azraith> God that scream is so good
[4:14:48] <joylesscloutchaser> these knight assholes i just keep fred dursting all over the map until he does that wind charge move
[4:14:51] <+Jiggisnipe> so aggressive
[4:14:54] <%youngking_kush> Your weapon art will probably break his stance
[4:14:58] <youngsn0w_> Dat hitbox
[4:15:03] <+eanscrale> Nobody likes Godrick, not even Godrick.
[4:15:03] <+anoldtoilet> ioh my god you ducked his swing by being staggered lmfao
[4:15:04] <%slipdog> Poise regenerates over time btw
[4:15:06] <NBUsagi> Shield bashes are destructive to poise
[4:15:06] <+anoldtoilet> footsies
[4:15:13] <%slipdog> You gotta get that burst D
[4:15:14] <VincentGraves> the ashes with low hitbox are the best
[4:15:15] <%wunp_fxs> damn no drop
[4:15:21] <hellhound123123> And the best part is... they respawn lul
[4:15:23] <tolloponik> drop: NOTHING
[4:15:24] <dundore77> your buff went away
[4:15:24] <+TopTieramisu> "with the buff"
[4:15:27] <BlackermanZX> damn woolz really needs more hp
[4:15:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bars?
[4:15:27] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:15:30] <%BestTeaMaker> what buff :)
[4:15:31] <Johannen> buff?
[4:15:32] <tolloponik> the buff went away
[4:15:35] <+Grayhammatter> what buff?
[4:15:36] <+azraith> That grease buff lasts like 15 seconds
[4:15:37] <hellhound123123> Your buff ran out
[4:15:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> hello there!
[4:15:43] <+anoldtoilet> isnt he glowing with a buff right now
[4:15:49] <CapCasual> @WoolieVersus You didn't have the buff for most of the fight.
[4:15:49] <+anoldtoilet> isnt that exalted flesh buff or something
[4:15:53] <hellhound123123> It's strength up
[4:15:54] <+ScatFace> pebble ashes of war is alright
[4:15:55] <hellhound123123> Not blood
[4:15:55] <+Solutha> Buff goes bye bye if you switch off
[4:15:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> the glow is from the flask buff I think?
[4:15:59] <VincentGraves> Woolie the buffs run out when switching weapons
[4:16:00] <+ScatFace> the follow up is nice
[4:16:03] <%slipdog> he has like 7 buffs lol this game is wild
[4:16:04] <Johannen> did he use exlated flesh?
[4:16:22] <%slipdog> Physick?
[4:16:28] <+anoldtoilet> physick makes sense
[4:16:31] <%youngking_kush> Yeah
[4:16:33] <CapCasual> Yes.
[4:16:35] <hellhound123123> Yes
[4:16:37] <@Irridium> the greases, yeah
[4:16:38] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[4:16:39] <+TopTieramisu> grease is like resin
[4:16:40] <Scorchfield> yeah, buffs on weapons expire when you switch them
[4:16:42] <VincentGraves> Greases yes
[4:16:42] <velgaduere> hasn't that always been the case?
[4:16:43] <%youngking_kush> If you switch weapons it takes your buff off
[4:16:47] <dundore77> physick and also the hug maidens health debuff
[4:16:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> "fix" LUL
[4:16:50] <+Huderga> fix?
[4:16:51] <+Finnmac5> Thats always been a rule, nothing to fix
[4:16:52] <+swesterly> yeah and grease buffs only last about 15-20 seconds
[4:16:52] <%slipdog> Fix? you want a burning sword in your pocket?
[4:16:53] <+anoldtoilet> oh yeah if you put your weapon away it expires. thats not a bug you have to just keep it out
[4:16:54] <tolloponik> "fix" ?
[4:16:57] <+TopTieramisu> the grease is in your pants
[4:16:57] <+Solutha> intended pain
[4:16:58] <+TopTieramisu> i like that
[4:16:59] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like its intended
[4:17:00] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[4:17:03] <%slipdog> Just cast spells with your left hand like a sane person LUL
[4:17:03] <Dopamien> grease rubs off on the clothes
[4:17:08] <Johannen> Reggie making a lot of sense
[4:17:08] <%tempestzephyr> lubed
[4:17:11] <QueequegTheater> They will never fix it because it's not an oversight
[4:17:17] <+ScatFace> it's always been that way in every soulsborne
[4:17:28] <velgaduere> "you're gonna have to piss on him for blood grease at that point" is a sentence I wish I didn't think to myself
[4:17:30] <%Lion_kun> This is why people keep their staffs on their left hand lol
[4:17:38] <hellhound123123> Note for Reggie: if you jump down the balcony where the barrel birds are (the second set), you can get to good stuff
[4:17:38] <+anoldtoilet> casting with a shield is cool though
[4:17:43] <%youngking_kush> @queequegtheater This, it's definitely meant to be that way so you can keep a buff weapon in the tuck
[4:17:46] <+anoldtoilet> there are some bosses where i really needed to do that
[4:17:51] <%youngking_kush> so you can't*
[4:17:53] <user_naim> Good ol Pharros. What a hero

[4:19:06] <%CateHecate> this looks like a room where good stuff happens

[4:21:16] <%EdgarLOLZ> oh LMAO
[4:21:16] <T_Sasquatch> Just utterly smacked
[4:21:16] <%radiorosewater> teaowlLUL
[4:21:17] <GingaNZ> crouch
[4:21:18] <%wunp_fxs> gotta crouch
[4:21:18] <+theoldone001> Should have taken those bags lol
[4:21:19] <+0neReeler> crouch?
[4:21:19] <%youngking_kush> Sound is a thing
[4:21:22] <+azraith> You gotta crouch
[4:21:22] <dundore77> so close to a shortcut too
[4:21:24] <Ersov> sound matters
[4:21:24] <CapCasual> You weren't crouching yhough.
[4:21:24] <+TopTieramisu> when in doubt, crouch
[4:21:25] <+FadingFrost> you gotta crouch
[4:21:25] <+robertoszek> crouch or nothing
[4:21:25] <prime_name> dragoon jump'd
[4:21:28] <VincentGraves> you can straight up touch their backs
[4:21:29] <+anoldtoilet> you have to crouch for stealth
[4:21:35] <dan_g_v> crouch
[4:21:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:21:36] <%youngking_kush> You also gotta crouch
[4:21:36] <tolloponik> croutch
[4:21:37] <+anoldtoilet> so youre mgs style
[4:21:39] <Johannen> crouch
[4:21:39] <%BestTeaMaker> Try new ash
[4:21:41] <%slipdog> remember that button you kept hitting on accident
[4:21:45] <dundore77> blocking will uncrouch too
[4:21:45] <+anoldtoilet> actually you may not HAVE to crouch if you walk slow enough
[4:21:46] <%CisealNine> Why R2 when you can backstab?
[4:21:47] <GingaNZ> its the only way
[4:21:47] <+0neReeler> charge r2, r2 > backstab
[4:21:48] <+ScatFace> woolie needs vitality
[4:21:50] <+anoldtoilet> but it makes it much easier
[4:21:53] <+FadingFrost> that's all there is
[4:21:56] <%slipdog> crouch + sprint is still quiter than jogging
[4:21:57] <VincentGraves> theres a secret area right here
[4:21:59] <%youngking_kush> If you crouch you can walk up right on their back, like to the point of touching them
[4:22:02] <hellhound123123> No it's completely silent if you sprint while crouching
[4:22:03] <chancho4tierra> no crouch = no stealth
[4:22:04] <+anoldtoilet> you can literally crouch walk up to enemies and hold forward into their butts and they wont aggro
[4:22:06] <+Javaa01> Crouch means no footstep sounds
[4:22:08] <+anoldtoilet> you can actually touch them
[4:22:08] <thepardack> crouch running usually doesn't alert
[4:22:10] <+0neReeler> crouch = almost invisible
[4:22:15] <hellhound123123> Secret area to the left
[4:22:15] <iacus_> crouch essentially reduces the aggro/awareness range of enemies. I don't think light or shadow or noise affect stealth
[4:22:17] <+fizzguy47> jist because you charge r2 doesn't mean they will crumple in 1
[4:22:17] <tolloponik> you can run and get right in their butt
[4:22:18] <@Menitta> They still at Stormvei- yup
[4:22:26] <tolloponik> while crouching
[4:22:31] <%slipdog> @iacus_ maybe not light level but day/night definitely does
[4:22:35] <hellhound123123> There's a secret area to the left
[4:22:40] <+aaymon86> Fast crouch is actually just as silent. And you're very low precense crouching.
[4:22:42] <+robertoszek> there's the new ash of war you bought too
[4:22:44] <Johannen> @Menitta I think we got a couple of streams of Stormveil Castle)
[4:22:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> curved greatsword guard counter seems pretty nice actually, big sweep
[4:22:49] <+swesterly> as long as your are crouched you can literally walk into their butts and they won't aggro if they don't see you
[4:22:54] <%youngking_kush> @iacus_ Noise does cuz there's a splash that silences your footsteps
[4:23:02] <%youngking_kush> a spell*
[4:23:03] <+fizzguy47> @hellhound123123 boo
[4:23:04] <+anoldtoilet> @iacus_ i believe light level and ambient cover matter. crouching in grass or behind a table is better than just in the open
[4:23:06] <+ScatFace> just always crouch when you see an enemy around to stay safe, you can attack from that position if things go wrong anyways
[4:23:16] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Almost LUL
[4:23:22] <+anoldtoilet> crouching also has a unique attack in the moveset on r1
[4:23:29] <+anoldtoilet> many weapons only have a stab on cr. r1
[4:23:43] <Johannen> @anoldtoilet its not unique, i think its the same as roll attack
[4:23:50] <Pubstar_LTD> @anoldtoilet im pretty sure crouch r1 is rolling attack
[4:23:59] <+anoldtoilet> i think some share and some are unique, i could swear ive seen a few that are different
[4:24:06] <+anoldtoilet> but that sounds right
[4:24:07] <+anoldtoilet> in general
[4:24:07] <T_Sasquatch> when woolie said there are while rising attacks in this game i lost my shit LUL

[4:24:29] <%slipdog> and we lost round 1 AND 2
[4:24:30] <wqorst> ambush into guard is a new one
[4:24:30] <Pubstar_LTD> @anoldtoilet Yeah you could be right, still awesome!
[4:24:35] <%slipdog> woolieU
[4:24:37] <+azraith> Good bleed damage
[4:24:42] <VJdarkworld> grafting is scary bruh monkaS
[4:24:43] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> It makes me really happy seeing just how many fleshed out DES-esque castles there are in this game. They are by far my favourite part 😊

[4:25:41] <+ScatFace> multiple ways to cheese that enemy
[4:25:42] <+Vikingdeath1> Still better than me. I shot that thing with Arrows.
[4:25:42] <iacus_> I actually just snuck past that guy. Never fought one past the tutorial
[4:25:43] <+Reverend_Roscoe> this is the third scion we've seen since the tutorial
[4:25:46] <+TopTieramisu> russian mma 2v1? what lore is that?
[4:25:51] <dundore77> @TopTieramisu theres a catacomb that has 2 of them ambush you
[4:26:03] <dundore77> oops wrong reply
[4:26:05] <%slipdog> and you get NOTHING
[4:26:09] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> The enemies can get really annoying at times though.
[4:26:18] <+ScatFace> so he got into those catacombs huh
[4:26:19] <iacus_> where did they get teh Uchi?
[4:26:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> remember to try R2 after the pebble
[4:26:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> R2 gives a lunge after it
[4:26:30] <+ScatFace> there's a follow up attack
[4:26:35] <hellhound123123> R2 after the cast
[4:26:37] <+ScatFace> r2 after using it
[4:26:39] <VJdarkworld> :O
[4:26:40] <Johannen> R2
[4:26:41] <%mr_sups> PEBBLE
[4:26:43] <@Menitta> fuck you bird
[4:26:48] <+ScatFace> it also stun locks enemies
[4:26:48] <+fizzguy47> is that the uchi
[4:26:59] <%SirGO0SE> atpBird hey fuck you
[4:27:03] <iacus_> man that pebble is really short range indeed
[4:27:03] <+orochiblood> birds are the worst enemy to practice on
[4:27:04] <+AnIrishPapaya> ooh that ash sucks compared to the real spell
[4:27:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> Hits like a truck for some reason
[4:27:09] <+HefestoForges> @WoolieVersus R2 after it does an impaling thrust
[4:27:17] <%youngking_kush> This is like the worst enemy to practice on lol
[4:27:21] <+TopTieramisu> pebble not really doing it
[4:27:23] <%youngking_kush> They too fast
[4:27:25] <+AnIrishPapaya> the actual spell goes so much further
[4:27:36] <%MajorCrasher> regular pebble has way more range and is spammable
[4:27:38] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah but half the ash of war is the thrust afterwords
[4:27:41] <%youngking_kush> Fast as FUCK boi
[4:27:44] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus R2 after pebble
[4:27:44] <+ScatFace> yeah but it's a slower cast time and there's no follow up attack
[4:27:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> Good counterpoke
[4:27:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> afterwards
[4:27:54] <hellhound123123> R2 after the pebble cast
[4:27:58] <agustorm123> This bird dont play around
[4:28:05] <johnny_scissors> the other big spells make better ashes of war, it gets better
[4:28:14] <VincentGraves> gotta read those descriptions
[4:28:14] <Johannen> Member that Ashes of War scale with weapon upgrades
[4:28:19] <%youngking_kush> There you go
[4:28:19] <%SirGO0SE> oh thats pretty good
[4:28:24] <+ScatFace> thank you woolie
[4:28:26] <+robertoszek> that's sick
[4:28:26] <+HefestoForges> it's a combo opener
[4:28:33] <%youngking_kush> It's like throwing the Kunai and then following up in Sekiro
[4:28:36] <%SirGO0SE> a lil stoke & poke
[4:28:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[4:28:37] <%mr_sups> Hit confirm
[4:28:39] <+ScatFace> that goes through shields if I remember correctly
[4:28:55] <+HefestoForges> @Johannen I'm still using pebble in Caelid, it's good and simple
[4:29:02] <%SirGO0SE> a lot goes through shields in this t.t
[4:29:06] <%slipdog> we need a favorites tab LUL
[4:29:22] <+ScatFace> the pebble is pretty great early on yeah
[4:29:34] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i wish i could see what my spells damage was so i could better compare them
[4:29:35] <Johannen> @HefestoForges Shuriken Chase is bae
[4:29:39] <BlackermanZX> birb got hands
[4:29:48] <xxHungryxx> #BladeBirds
[4:29:54] <+ScatFace> you can spam it to stun lock enemies, you can hit confirm with the follow up attack
[4:30:06] <+ScatFace> missing isn't much of an issue because of the fast recovery
[4:30:12] <rustybuckethead21> im sorry, is that a pigeon with boxcutters tapped to its feet?
[4:30:16] <+TopTieramisu> i thought going spellsword would be the griffith path of the game, but i feel like a faithsword is more griffith-like
[4:30:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> Yeah just have to find a punching bag close to a grace to compare damage
[4:30:31] <%SirGO0SE> @rustybuckethead21 problem?
[4:30:35] <+TopTieramisu> i think the prisoner class made me think it was more griffith-like
[4:30:48] <+ScatFace> @rustybuckethead21 Birb with a long sword
[4:30:50] <+HefestoForges> @TopTieramisu my Griffith build is going dex/int/fth for the holies

[4:31:26] <xxHungryxx> I wish I had winds powers... 🥺
[4:31:30] <%radiorosewater> oh
[4:31:32] <dundore77> i got reggie lucky with those guy and got their chest armor first drop from fighting them
[4:31:53] <rustybuckethead21> @rustybuckethead21 no problem, but now im picturing someone getting chased by what i described.
[4:31:54] <+TopTieramisu> i bet miyazaki hates it when he sees people just casually strafing around moves in ds1/des
[4:31:59] <VincentGraves> there's the jumping ash of war right here, just gotta jump of the ledge outside
[4:32:04] <%akajaybay> I like their helm with the flowing hair attached
[4:32:23] <%G_Thunders> I like to believe that Miyazaki enjoys seeing the ways people break his games
[4:32:56] <JeoDood> he has seen people played
[4:33:00] <%youngking_kush> @g_thunders You can tell he does by different things they tweaked about this game
[4:33:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> @akajaybay I farmed the one close to the lift grace for a while just to get it
[4:33:10] <+TopTieramisu> from the way tracking has only gotten stronger, i'd say he'd prefer if you roll through attacks then strafe
[4:33:20] <xxHungryxx> Miyazaki says "Excellent" just like Mr. Burns
[4:33:20] <berasite> You can block into back step
[4:33:20] <%youngking_kush> Hell alot of the weapon skills are like shit that would've gotten nodded into DS3
[4:33:29] <%youngking_kush> modded*
[4:33:35] <iacus_> I bet woolie would love the quickstep ash of war
[4:33:44] <%SainEdge> @G_Thunders probably, but i also remember him not believing that people beat the game no hit LUL
[4:33:47] <slackerunchained> Big Poise for Big Bois.
[4:34:05] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @NobuuNobuu
[4:34:05] <dundore77> he's a real one
[4:34:10] <+ScatFace> respect the high poise
[4:34:14] <+KingpinLarry> Aggetsuko
[4:34:15] <%youngking_kush> Woolz may need to leave and upgrade his weapon
[4:34:16] <%Prevot> remember crucible knight
[4:34:16] <+TopTieramisu> poise is real
[4:34:19] <VincentGraves> halberds make this enemy a joke
[4:34:20] <Johannen> I think Woolie's habit of diagonal dodge gets him killed way more times than it gives him opportunity to strike
[4:34:21] <%SirGO0SE> @iacus_ I put that shit on everything (tm_
[4:34:22] <%G_Thunders> I finally tried hoarfrost stomp ash of war after seeing so many people say it’s good, and that one is so broken I have to believe someone entered a value wrong coding it lol
[4:34:24] <SulfurousAcid> big poise for big boys
[4:34:25] <+Finnmac5> Punishing them leaving themselves open is how I did it. Rolling through that dash and going into a backstab top tier
[4:34:27] <xxHungryxx> No yelling, this is a library
[4:34:30] <%oneimportantthing> Knights in Elden Ring are a fuck
[4:34:39] <user_naim> just a matter of getting used to it
[4:34:40] <+NobuuNobuu> caps was on by mistake
[4:34:47] <VincentGraves> guard counter the last hit
[4:34:48] <%CisealNine> If you do backstabs, they are easier.
[4:34:52] <%youngking_kush> @woolieversus Your Weapon Skill will be very handing in breaking his poise. Just remember to do the follow-up R2
[4:34:58] <megaman_sentinel> everyone in this game is f*****
[4:35:01] <ITechedDat> fighting that guy felt like the first time i fought a black knight in ds1
[4:35:36] <Frazbeee> more like lothric knight
[4:35:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:35:38] <+ScatFace> @youngking_kush bloodhound curved greatsword yeah?
[4:35:39] <xxHungryxx> If an eagle threw a MFing barrel at me I'd think my day would be ruined
[4:35:41] <+NottaAlotta> fighting the birds was super annoying every time so I started going around them
[4:35:46] <%youngking_kush> @scatface Yup
[4:35:46] <HelghastTroop> so woolie finally going through stormveil
[4:35:50] <iacus_> using the expensive daggers... hm
[4:35:50] <HelghastTroop> hows it been going
[4:35:57] <VincentGraves> someone should let woolie know about the secret drop here. It's easily missed
[4:35:58] <%youngking_kush> Crazy strong weapon skill
[4:36:00] <+OniOniOniiii> a smart bird could totally learn how to use those too. like a raven or sumn
[4:36:08] <iacus_> take out the fancy cutlery
[4:36:14] <+fizzguy47> !motivated
[4:36:14] <@Moobot> @fizzguy47 2542 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:36:16] <+ScatFace> he could use the weapon art at the end of the enemy's stinger
[4:36:30] <+TopTieramisu> i doubt a raven could hold a barrel
[4:36:34] <+Order_of_Mystery> they find rogier?
[4:36:36] <+mahler2> Hey Woolie what did you think of the Kirby Demo?
[4:36:46] <+ScatFace> @order_of_mystery yes he did
[4:36:48] <%sherlockkat> does glintblade have more raneg than pebble?
[4:36:56] <+OniOniOniiii> @TopTieramisu lolol noo i meant just blades on their feets
[4:37:01] <HelghastTroop> noticed he got scarf armor

[4:37:24] <@Menitta> fuckin avatar the last Airbender
[4:37:24] <+ScatFace> glintblade has longer range than the ashes of war pebble but about the same range as the spell glintpebble
[4:37:26] <%EdgarLOLZ> nice
[4:37:28] <yukichocomilk> YOU... DID IT
[4:37:28] <%akajaybay> oh I never got one of those
[4:37:29] <iacus_> you can wield torchpoles!

[4:37:38] <xxHungryxx> Wield torchpole
[4:37:40] <VincentGraves> omg that's a weapon too?

[4:38:23] <HelghastTroop> just conjures shit storms
[4:38:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> When you need to see far away
[4:38:24] <+TopTieramisu> The Lord of Light
[4:38:24] <+SammyOVision> LINK THE FIRST FLAME NOW
[4:38:26] <FaxineiroDePosto> don't let the fire die out!
[4:38:26] <xxHungryxx> new build
[4:38:27] <%mr_sups> fire fire
[4:38:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Ashen one...no wait wrong game
[4:38:35] <%youngking_kush> I think ZeroLenny is no joke making a Torch Only Run video as we speak
[4:38:37] <stevenellis386> Pyromancy is back baby!
[4:38:37] <JeoDood> spear
[4:38:45] <+TopTieramisu> pyromancy never left
[4:38:48] <@Menitta> can you put ashes of war on torches lol
[4:38:56] <HelghastTroop> lol we4ll guess what
[4:38:57] <+theoldone001> There's multiple pointy hoods in the game too
[4:38:57] <%cubbywolf> torch is strong
[4:39:00] <+aWanderingKaivo> wait really? I never tried that lol
[4:39:00] <+ScatFace> I like how fire is faith based because of the lore behind it in the game
[4:39:02] <%youngking_kush> @menitta Probably lol
[4:39:03] <HelghastTroop> FeelsBadMan
[4:39:06] <xxHungryxx> There actually is a special torch that lets you breath fire
[4:39:29] <%mr_sups> Are you begging for a magic lesson?
[4:39:30] <@Solidus_113> POWER
[4:39:31] <+TopTieramisu> faith based fire is also very ASoIaF
[4:39:36] <HelghastTroop> i was suprised how many torches are in this game
[4:39:43] <HelghastTroop> alot more then you would think
[4:39:43] <%radiorosewater> @youngking_kush torch fucks in this game
[4:39:47] <+ScatFace> @menitta you can put "no skill" on the torch
[4:39:49] <+theoldone001> Y'all laugh at the spear torch but those hollows using them fuck you up with them
[4:39:53] <Pubstar_LTD> Rogier <3
[4:39:58] <%akajaybay> most of him anyway
[4:40:01] <$Rafraud> Kappa
[4:40:04] <%cubbywolf> drag the knight to him and see what happens
[4:40:04] <+ScatFace> he got the coolest one
[4:40:05] <+duckmeat_woohoo> Is he jolly? He's rogier!
[4:40:17] <+duckmeat_woohoo> yo ho ho take a bite of gum gum
[4:40:27] <Frazbeee> jolly roger
[4:40:44] <%youngking_kush> It can yes
[4:40:47] <xxHungryxx> Carian Great sword ❤️
[4:40:55] <+Breadmun> Ashes scale with the level of the weapon
[4:40:59] <HelghastTroop> i tired spinning weapon, not as good as i wouldve hoped
[4:41:01] <+anoldtoilet> they scale off weapon ujpgrade level
[4:41:03] <+anoldtoilet> not stats
[4:41:03] <@Solidus_113> with the weapon yeah
[4:41:03] <PepperJam_Art> The skill scales with weapon level
[4:41:05] <+Order_of_Mystery> scales on weapon upgrade
[4:41:07] <okramv> what makes is cast faster boys
[4:41:10] <+SaintSalted> they dont scale with int at all they only scale off of your weapons upgrade level
[4:41:13] <okramv> it*
[4:41:16] <JeoDood> weapon level
[4:41:19] <Zebroneath> Scales off weapon level
[4:41:20] <HelghastTroop> yes ashes are your infusions now
[4:41:24] <@Solidus_113> and spells scale with the sorcery stat on the staff @WoolieVersus
[4:41:29] <%edgeroth> the weapon art scales with the weapon level, the weapon affinity scales with the corresponding stat
[4:41:29] <@Solidus_113> as well as int
[4:41:29] <+SaintSalted> i run a quality build and the magic arts do tons of damage
[4:41:30] <+TopTieramisu> ashes are so cool
[4:41:31] <%cubbywolf> you spin me right round baby right round like a record baby round round round round
[4:41:37] <+theoldone001> Only innate weapon skills scale of the stats right? Ashes of War do not?
[4:41:40] <+TopTieramisu> great way to customize your build on the fly
[4:41:51] <%youngking_kush> @woolieversus So you can put a Magic Ashe of War on a weapon, have that weapon scale with Strength, but you will still get more magic damage with the skill based off the weapon's level
[4:41:53] <+TopTieramisu> even if you don't use the weapon art
[4:41:53] <+anoldtoilet> yeah every staff has a "sorcery buff" stat
[4:42:00] <+anoldtoilet> and it goes up with upgrades ytea
[4:42:05] <ITechedDat> int scales the spell scaling on the weapon, and THAT scales the damage of the spell
[4:42:06] <HelghastTroop> theres also things that let you put new infusions on ashes
[4:42:08] <+ScatFace> staffs have different soft caps
[4:42:09] <@Menitta> does the same apply with seals and faith?
[4:42:20] <+ScatFace> it's weird
[4:42:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> Synergize
[4:42:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Menitta I would imagine so
[4:42:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> damn, that guy died of ligma
[4:42:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:42:45] <+ScatFace> seals also have different scaling depending on the seal you use @menitta
[4:42:46] <@Menitta> I hit the soft cap on faith and now my vigor is shit lol
[4:42:46] <+Finnmac5> Poison is actually good in this game
[4:42:47] <HelghastTroop> poison darts busted as fuck
[4:42:54] <VincentGraves> I've cheesed so many things with a bow
[4:42:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah there is a str/faith seal
[4:43:03] <@Menitta> @scatface that makes sense
[4:43:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Menitta lvl 80, 20 vigor gang
[4:43:08] <HelghastTroop> posion can be put on almost everything too
[4:43:15] <dundore77> search the area first before fighting him
[4:43:16] <%G_Thunders> @menitta I think so. Also seals that have split scaling like the str/fth one softcap earlier, I think it’s like 35 str/35 fth for that specific one
[4:43:22] <%cubbywolf> bullshiting
[4:43:24] <okramv> how do you cast faster
[4:43:24] <%BinaryFireball> just take a giant dump on him
[4:43:27] <iacus_> why drop down there tho?
[4:43:28] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[4:43:32] <+ScatFace> yes you can
[4:43:36] <JeoDood> yes
[4:43:41] <+TopTieramisu> i love how clumsy the player character is. whoopsie! table destroyed
[4:43:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> is there a dex/faith seal? would be cool with that one colossal sword
[4:43:46] <%cubbywolf> that took me hours to find how to get
[4:43:46] <+ScatFace> multiple ways to cheese that enemy
[4:43:47] <HelghastTroop> i use a dagger to do cheeky poison procs
[4:43:53] <%cubbywolf> but it's not that hard
[4:44:00] <+duckmeat_woohoo> wakey wakey
[4:44:09] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[4:44:14] <ckbooks> I bullshitted this guy with a doorway super hard.
[4:44:16] <+0neReeler> there's a perfect door downstairs for that
[4:44:17] <%BinaryFireball> just waiting for him to fall off
[4:44:19] <+Krasmeyts> I believe the phrase 'like a punk' was used earlier?
[4:44:37] <VincentGraves> yea it's time to cheese
[4:44:39] <+anoldtoilet> i had 99 stack of arrows and just shot this guy to death lol
[4:44:42] <+robertoszek> now THIS is an INT build
[4:44:42] <+anoldtoilet> big cheese
[4:44:43] <%Hapsam> now thats how you play elden ring

[4:45:17] <HelghastTroop> the next evolution of AI
[4:45:20] <%JetpackMcQuack> I’m not level 1 anymore prick
[4:45:21] <HelghastTroop> smarter sims
[4:45:31] <+fizzguy47> this tactic will be less useful in the future

[4:46:01] <HelghastTroop> i wish this guy had a plunge attack animation

[4:46:07] <%okuriskyles> reggie NO
[4:46:07] <+TopTieramisu> woolie's soul has been tarnished
[4:46:08] <%cubbywolf> turn to the right and jump you can do it
[4:46:10] <FrostedZaibatsu> @akajaybay 5-0 beginning of the game
[4:46:10] <HelghastTroop> we need more dudes
[4:46:13] <HelghastTroop> that do that
[4:46:16] <+Krasmeyts> Try grafting? woolieFROG
[4:46:17] <%oneimportantthing> Remember when people though this game would be too easy
[4:46:21] <+anoldtoilet> @QueequegTheater im two lords in and going through caelid at like 16 vigor and i feel extremely stupid
[4:46:24] <no123450n> fuck them birds
[4:46:25] <FrostedZaibatsu> even know thats a different one
[4:46:26] <zegram250> I remember I came back lvl 40ish after beating the second major boss and it still gave me a hard time
[4:46:29] <%okuriskyles> people still say it's too easy lol
[4:46:37] <user_naim> @anoldtoilet 16 jesus
[4:46:38] <dundore77> that enemy type is always a pain
[4:46:42] <+fizzguy47> @anoldtoilet that's too little
[4:46:43] <HelghastTroop> i hope will will unlock speedrun strats soon Kappa
[4:47:03] <+anoldtoilet> "just dont get hit" is getting a lot harder lol
[4:47:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> I see people say they are getting one shot with like 30-35 vigor on some late game stuff
[4:47:10] <spaghettiweaver> @QueequegTheater you fail, fail zombie. pump that number up!
[4:47:16] <%cubbywolf> nah
[4:47:20] <+TopTieramisu> a lot of people complain about all the OP strats in the game
[4:47:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> but I am not there yet myself
[4:47:22] <%cubbywolf> but yah
[4:47:23] <+TopTieramisu> so yeah, people complain
[4:47:29] <+ScatFace> at this pace, will will hit part 100 in the let's play videos
[4:47:30] <%MajorCrasher> absolutely run past
[4:47:30] <%tempestzephyr> running is always an option
[4:47:32] <%cubbywolf> you can always sprint past them
[4:47:33] <%akajaybay> there's a lot of you don't HAVE to kill this encounters. but also its nice to kill them
[4:47:37] <+ScatFace> and I love that thought
[4:47:38] <%cubbywolf> coward it iut
[4:47:38] <VincentGraves> woolie there's a secret area where that second bird is. Easy to miss
[4:47:56] <agustorm123> Coward run
[4:48:00] <HelghastTroop> when everything is op all the not op stuff just sucks
[4:48:05] <%edgeroth> it's time for sprint souls
[4:48:14] <+ScatFace> damnit no backstab
[4:48:16] <%cubbywolf> we live through those
[4:48:19] <squirtkitten> i dont understand why they'd design enemies to be so insufferable and boring to fight where the best strat is to ignore and run past woolieFROG
[4:48:19] <%CisealNine> "Turn around. Stick it out." - Reggie, 2022
[4:48:20] <HelghastTroop> lets hear it for speedborne
[4:48:27] <iacus_> I have like 18 vigor and I'm already in Caelid...
[4:48:36] <%SirGO0SE> this guy real good at punishing rolls
[4:48:39] <MyNameIsRasus> this game punishes panic rolling so hard
[4:48:50] <%cubbywolf> the stomp is cheap because you can't see them start quickly and it's an aoe
[4:48:53] <+TopTieramisu> these guys aren't that boring. you just gotta know how to approach them
[4:48:58] <agustorm123> Beans boys
[4:48:58] <+duckmeat_woohoo> can you backstab with greatswords?
[4:49:03] <user_naim> @squirtkitten scary enemies are exciting
[4:49:11] <kingbreaker21> @duckmeat_woohoo Yes
[4:49:12] <%cubbywolf> you can backstab with anything
[4:49:12] <+duckmeat_woohoo> LOOOOOOOOL

[4:49:32] <agustorm123> He send you to hell
[4:49:36] <+Jaromero435> biggest backdown
[4:49:37] <VincentGraves> Slash weapons are bad against armor
[4:49:39] <%Prevot> not a lot of leveling going on, eh?
[4:49:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:49:44] <%cubbywolf> goodbye runes
[4:49:44] <KingOfTheGeats> found the secret area of the level
[4:49:48] <+ScatFace> needs more bonk
[4:49:51] <HelghastTroop> paul from aqua teen is down there too
[4:49:56] <iacus_> he takes forever to kill w flails too
[4:49:57] <%MajorCrasher> what's the bloodhound been upgraded to?
[4:50:03] <%cubbywolf> get that style to plumet with style
[4:50:06] <iacus_> eventually I just ran past them all
[4:50:07] <HelghastTroop> cookie for anyone who knows what i mtaling about
[4:50:10] <+TopTieramisu> a thing that bothers me from time to time about fromsoft controls is that roll inputs are negative edge and not when you press the button
[4:50:11] <no123450n> these birds are trained to deliver nukes
[4:50:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> its +0 I think..
[4:50:14] <HelghastTroop> talking*
[4:50:19] <iacus_> snuck past the grafted scion and the halberd knight also
[4:50:21] <%edgeroth> I think his speaking
[4:50:23] <+TopTieramisu> a biproduct of run being on the same button
[4:50:25] <dundore77> woolie you also have a health debuff currently until you use that poise item idk if you've known that
[4:50:27] <VincentGraves> I was thinking a halberd or greatspear, those break their poise easily
[4:50:37] <zenith0111> ironmouseMeltdown
[4:50:42] <%cubbywolf> is Paul the spider demon?
[4:50:44] <%SirGO0SE> wonder why theres no notes near that area to the left after he spawns
[4:50:45] <squirtkitten> @TopTieramisu that half second delay between button input and action in game... BibleThump
[4:50:48] <%akajaybay> weapon upgrades are very nice
[4:50:49] <+ScatFace> @dundore77 5% is nothing
[4:50:49] <HelghastTroop> jump attacks best way to break poise
[4:50:54] <%SirGO0SE> finna log on and put one there, maybe people are missing it
[4:50:56] <fluffyesttail> Woolie et al is going funky in the elden zone
[4:50:58] <Questiy> Training birds to commit arson is the ultimate in tactical espionage
[4:50:59] <%MajorCrasher> @awanderingkaivo ah that would explain it
[4:51:07] <dundore77> for his health its still smaller than he would want
[4:51:07] <%cubbywolf> DODGED
[4:51:10] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @toptieramisu Whats negative edge?
[4:51:13] <iacus_> they comin'
[4:51:13] <%cubbywolf> Revenge!
[4:51:14] <ShinyVagikarp> LUL
[4:51:14] <squirtkitten> he didnt doge he just sprinted lmao
[4:51:15] <no123450n> ladder tech
[4:51:20] <+TopTieramisu> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy when the input comes out when you release the button
[4:51:20] <%cubbywolf> uh oh
[4:51:23] <zenith0111> @cubbywolf Thats B-Rap the Rappin Spider
[4:51:26] <+anoldtoilet> rofl
[4:51:28] <%Ashenik1> LUL
[4:51:28] <+anoldtoilet> this fucking guy
[4:51:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> Oh boy PogChamp
[4:51:31] <w_khan> Oh chuncky session to watch later <3
[4:51:31] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[4:51:31] <+pectusumbra> should have kicked him
[4:51:34] <iacus_> now fight the knight in the roo-
[4:51:37] <iacus_> oh well
[4:51:37] <%cubbywolf> that fall omg LUL
[4:51:39] <%therustystream> wait is this the normal black knight that hangs out here?
[4:51:42] <%therustystream> he looks different
[4:51:49] <perfect_disaster> this fight is sick!
[4:51:52] <%Prevot> big dick knight aint having none of your bullshit
[4:51:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:52:07] <%cubbywolf> he's the normal night here.maybe it's dif at night?
[4:52:16] <%SirGO0SE> is his shield move an ash of war? its so sick
[4:52:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> that 2h attack looks super backstabbable
[4:52:19] <%therustystream> maybe, the color just looks off to me
[4:52:20] <%Ashenik1> pied piper AI monkaS
[4:52:22] <+anoldtoilet> yeah goose
[4:52:28] <%therustystream> moveset looks the exact same I'm just crazy ig
[4:52:29] <%SirGO0SE> @anoldtoilet Kreygasm
[4:52:31] <Plughead_> is this an unupgraded weapons? he's doing very little damage
[4:52:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Plughead_ I think so yeah
[4:52:42] <perfect_disaster> I cant belive you dodge that
[4:52:43] <+anoldtoilet> most of the wind/storm moves the enemies do in this dungeon you can equip i think. thats storm stomp or something?
[4:52:46] <iacus_> should be at +3 but idk
[4:52:46] <JeoDood> yea
[4:52:51] <%cubbywolf> yeah you can get that ash I think its s
[4:52:53] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @toptieramisu oh shit wow. That's quite problematic for a series that's becoming more action-focused. Cheers for the explanation 👍
[4:53:03] <squirtkitten> the stomp part is one ash of war, and i believe the storm charge is another
[4:53:03] <%cubbywolf> yeah he needs to upgrade this weapon
[4:53:09] <%Ashenik1> can you redo bosses here like in Sekiro?
[4:53:17] <%cubbywolf> this weapon does take a dif material than other ones
[4:53:19] <chambatron> jump r 2 to avoid and hit him
[4:53:20] <+swesterly> i feel like miyazaki has night terrors where people chain back stabs on black knights and guys like this are his answer to that
[4:53:28] <Plughead_> is this a somber weapon?
[4:53:36] <+askalta> yes
[4:53:39] <no123450n> @Plughead_ yea
[4:53:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> I think so, but it just takes 1 of the mat
[4:53:48] <%therustystream> chunky damage there
[4:53:50] <squirtkitten> @swesterly it started in DS3 with the lothric knights having a instant 180 2 frame shield bash if you wnet behind them
[4:53:57] <%Prevot> I guess the problem with upgrading is if he doesn't wanna commit to this weapon, it takes rarer materials than normal weapons
[4:54:07] <+swesterly> @squirtkitten 100%
[4:54:07] <%cubbywolf> yeah woolz needs to upgrade, your supposed to have it upgraded by here k think
[4:54:15] <iacus_> you can go over the sandbags
[4:54:15] <perfect_disaster> how do I get that chest!
[4:54:15] <stevenellis386> wth
[4:54:16] <+TopTieramisu> once he's made decent progress, upgrade material becomes common
[4:54:16] <dundore77> check over the small wall
[4:54:19] <%therustystream> fun stuff going on there
[4:54:20] <iacus_> and over the wall
[4:54:25] <Plughead_> ultimately, there is no risk though, since you can buy mats eventually
[4:54:27] <user_naim> I’m surprised by how much DS3 tech this game throws at new players. Fun times though
[4:54:29] <%cubbywolf> yeah but he's in the 1st 10% of the game
[4:54:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> the somber ones seem to take much less mats though, I have a +2 and its just taking one of each stone per level
[4:54:33] <+theoldone001> @Prevot You get plenty of materials, specially if you do lots of exploring and find the bell bearings.
[4:54:34] <+anoldtoilet> dragoon
[4:54:35] <iacus_> ouchie
[4:54:36] <%therustystream> that was sick lol
[4:54:38] <MightyN7> :O
[4:54:39] <%Ashenik1> get fucked
[4:54:40] <+anoldtoilet> thats also one you can get
[4:54:40] <perfect_disaster> fuck
[4:54:40] <stevenellis386> fuckin ow
[4:54:41] <OblivionSword1> YOOOO DRAGOON JUMP
[4:54:44] <+Solidarity_> styling
[4:54:45] <Lewisisphat> those dudes suck
[4:54:45] <%cubbywolf> rekt
[4:54:47] <squirtkitten> has woolie committed to not using crouch and stealth for an opening backstab?
[4:54:49] <slackerunchained> Get Dragoon'd
[4:54:50] <%cubbywolf> time for upgrades woolz
[4:54:51] <fluffyesttail> Woolie is playing honestly!
[4:54:54] <no123450n> the baselard ones are a bit rough
[4:54:55] <iacus_> the frustration
[4:54:56] <johnny_scissors> got a final fantasy dragoon over here
[4:54:56] <+Proxzo> Dragon Dive!
[4:54:58] <%therustystream> I just ran past those dudes cause fighting them sucks ass
[4:55:00] <coziestbank> This is def the trickiest "expected" early game run.
[4:55:03] <+fizzguy47> @awanderingkaivo sombers take 1 per level
[4:55:04] <Gelphaze> These boys are hard.
[4:55:07] <$Rafraud> Dont let it set in
[4:55:09] <%CateHecate> AHHH YER AN HONEST LIAR WOOLZ
[4:55:14] <%Prevot> @squirtkitten yeah woolie should use more stealth
[4:55:15] <johnny_scissors> Also it's real ass that those knights respawn
[4:55:16] <+theoldone001> The Bloodhound blade is not a bad choice to commit to early on actually
[4:55:18] <%cubbywolf> it set in
[4:55:28] <DSD24> Eyy I see Woolie has the cool clothes on
[4:55:36] <iacus_> when I saw such a long stretch of annoying/sponge enemies without site of grace I just started running past lol
[4:55:39] <DSD24> Exile chest piece looks so comfy
[4:55:40] <+solzan2000> be cool if he did delay jump
[4:55:43] <%Ashenik1> @DSD24  comfy
[4:55:47] <+coldsama> Woolie underestimate heavy attacks and poise breaking greatly imo
[4:55:50] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[4:55:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> underupgraded
[4:56:04] <%therustystream> number could be higher
[4:56:04] <%cubbywolf> your not under leveled your under upgraded
[4:56:05] <depressioncherrie> More like your weapon is underleveled
[4:56:07] <DSD24> More clothes should be comfy
[4:56:12] <coziestbank> Did they do the southern pennisylia yet?
[4:56:14] <+segmentedfool> You are not under leveled
[4:56:17] <zenith0111> No you have the tools this is a lot of peoples first area
[4:56:17] <%Prevot> I don't thikn you're underleveled, your weapon on the other hand....
[4:56:19] <+segmentedfool> Just no upgrades
[4:56:24] <fluffyesttail> Your weapon could maybe be buffed!
[4:56:24] <+TopTieramisu> @cubbywolf i don't know what to say. some commitment has to take place at some point if you want to gain power
[4:56:25] <iacus_> yeah likely. Weapon should be at least +3 for this
[4:56:25] <BlackermanZX> maybe more damage and more hp
[4:56:26] <$Rafraud> Running is a good and important lesson
[4:56:27] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenik1 No u can't. But you can replicate their remembrances (AKA their boss souls) so that u can get both of their boss weapons instead of just one.
[4:56:29] <Plughead_> undergeared definitely
[4:56:30] <+fizzguy47> you are missing damage, definitely
[4:56:30] <%hax_metatron> You should go do Weeping Peninsula!!!!!
[4:56:31] <+capybruhArt> are backstabs dishonest? the enemies won't hesitate to use them if given the opportunity
[4:56:31] <+anoldtoilet> upgrade staff too if you have resources
[4:56:31] <BlackermanZX> def more hp
[4:56:33] <MajesticBonfire> Need more power
[4:56:36] <%MajorCrasher> you could always do weeping peninsula for levels
[4:56:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> or +2 for a somber weapon
[4:56:40] <dude_bruhh> Elden "can't upgrade your weapon" ring, yeah my initial experience too
[4:56:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[4:56:41] <CatsDrunkonCopper> you can go to weeping peninsula
[4:56:42] <SmortyPuffin> running away is NOT shameful
[4:56:51] <coziestbank> Are they running this before Weeping Pennysia to the south?
[4:56:56] <%AngryAsian5> Jeeeezus
[4:57:00] <%cubbywolf> yeah you need upgrades because you should be staggering
[4:57:01] <slackerunchained> Wait till he gets up then kick him off. :P
[4:57:02] <no123450n> gotta love the random superarmors
[4:57:02] <Pubstar_LTD> @dude_bruhh and then you learn about mines and gg
[4:57:04] <internetskeletonn> go do another zone
[4:57:04] <$Rafraud> POISE
[4:57:05] <fluffyesttail> What's Weeping Peninsula?
[4:57:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bulge knight keeps collecting Ws
[4:57:14] <%Ashenik1> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy  YOUR TELLING ME THIS NOW?!
[4:57:21] <%youngking_kush> @fluffyesttail South of Lingrave
[4:57:21] <%G_Thunders> They probably think this is supposed to come before weeping peninsula. I definitely did them in the wrong order too
[4:57:25] <%CateHecate> yeah you might be better off getting your weapon upgraded then doing the southern part of limgrave instead
[4:57:27] <+Krasmeyts> @internetskeletonn that's pretty bad manners.
[4:57:31] <+solzan2000> they're fine  imo, just need to learn the mu
[4:57:32] <%tempestzephyr> there's no reason to fight every enemy after you die
[4:57:35] <DSD24> Band of the Hawk
[4:57:38] <CapCasual> @WoolieVersus Not levels, but upgrading your weapons. I'm 99% sure you passed by a Somber Smithing Stone 1 in Limgrave, and you already have a 2. That should be enough.
[4:57:41] <+thesw1tch> fuck it sit back down lol
[4:57:42] <iacus_> the voice when she gets hit lol
[4:57:43] <+anoldtoilet> @G_Thunders weeping is sort of optional. the game definitely tells you to go here and not there
[4:57:43] <%youngking_kush> Yeah Woolz needs weapon upgrades man, then he'll be fine
[4:57:44] <NeoSoundBox> try guard counter
[4:57:48] <%therustystream> poise break def important against those guys
[4:58:02] <+0neReeler> poise break crutches, sweep the leg
[4:58:05] <huskarl_zap> also faster weapons are just better in this game
[4:58:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> you get like what 2 flask upgrades in weeping peninsula too?
[4:58:07] <DSD24> These birds are still cute though
[4:58:07] <dinkledaberry> Should just spam stun those guys to death with the ash of war magic move from earlier
[4:58:08] <slackerunchained> Whenever Woolie's character screams, I think my cat is meowing. :\
[4:58:08] <%G_Thunders> @anoldtoilet optional yeah, but it’s much easier than stormveil castle for sure
[4:58:10] <$Rafraud> Literally fuck it
[4:58:11] <iacus_> @G_Thunders tells you both actually. the grace trails also point south
[4:58:13] <user_naim> birb too fast, knight too stronk
[4:58:22] <SaiyanShoto> That scream kills me every time LUL LUL
[4:58:23] <%cubbywolf> South but hole
[4:58:38] <dundore77> theres also a big thing your missing if your looking to fight the grafted guy right now that'll make it easier
[4:58:43] <DSD24> Its that grey area
[4:58:51] <%Ashenik1> you dont have to
[4:58:51] <+tuchpi> come back later Kappa
[4:58:54] <%youngking_kush> The back down is encouraged in Elden Ring
[4:58:57] <johnny_scissors> You can just run past everything btw
[4:59:00] <%cubbywolf> bang your head on the wall
[4:59:04] <+anoldtoilet> you can definitely do this now woolie but it would be easier for you if you go back to round table and upgrade your sword to +1 or 2
[4:59:06] <%tempestzephyr> that sounds like a mind goblin
[4:59:13] <%Deosier> it does feel like the weapons might need to be +1 or +2
[4:59:14] <+tuchpi> snail goblin LUL
[4:59:15] <+0neReeler> gauntlet
[4:59:15] <%therustystream> if they didn't have so much HP too it would be better
[4:59:15] <+SammyOVision> Finding alternate routes is encouraged.
[4:59:18] <%therustystream> it's a long fight
[4:59:19] <coziestbank> This is definetly the type of game, where you can always find something interesting to do to get a little stronger.
[4:59:20] <%cubbywolf> chat FYI you can jump to the roof to the right of the grace here
[4:59:22] <Plughead_> you just lack damage tbh
[4:59:22] <+fizzguy47> you can definitely beat the grafted dude now
[4:59:25] <@Solidus_113> it's just asking for a +3 weapon, because remember you don't ususally get the round table before this dungeon
[4:59:38] <Johannen> Wait, he is still running basic bloodhound sword with 0 upgrades?
[4:59:41] <user_naim> @solidus_113 wait you don’t?
[4:59:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> definitely, you could have a +3 normal or a +2 somber for this
[4:59:43] <slackerunchained> [Yakity-Sax Intensifies]
[4:59:43] <+segmentedfool> yep
[4:59:44] <%cubbywolf> the building woolie just entered,  you can make it to the roof
[4:59:45] <+anoldtoilet> @Solidus_113 oh i thought you got it right after margit the omen
[4:59:47] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, this game gives you a LOT of options
[4:59:53] <%Pillagius> IMO What Woolie keeps forgetting - use weapon skill. he woulld've been done a while ago with these guys
[4:59:54] <DSD24> Grafted Guy down there is a jerk
[5:00:00] <+turtlemasterx13> turtlemasterx13 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:00:03] <+TopTieramisu> it's a game that lets you play it as hard or not as you need
[5:00:03] <no123450n> can backstab this one
[5:00:10] <Pubstar_LTD> I got roundtable right before Margit
[5:00:13] <iacus_> over the wall on the right via sandbags!
[5:00:16] <%therustystream> good shit woolie
[5:00:16] <dundore77> @Solidus_113 wait really? i got invited to the round table super early by just following the guided path
[5:00:16] <%cubbywolf> just a +1 would give him 50dmg or more
[5:00:22] <+solzan2000> smart play
[5:00:23] <+fizzguy47> see
[5:00:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Solidus_113 you don't? I was under the impression everyone had the roundtable before margit
[5:00:31] <zenith0111> Staggered and Bled to death
[5:00:32] <@Menitta> You can get round table really early.
[5:00:34] <DSD24> His armor has weird duck feet
[5:00:35] <iacus_> if it bleeds, we can kill it
[5:00:36] <+SammyOVision> Fun ahead
[5:00:41] <DSD24> Ooooo
[5:00:44] <%commanderclaw> I had to grind for like half a fucking hour to get that dude's helmet
[5:00:44] <Johannen> I got roundtable after killing Margit
[5:00:46] <jam_chamoy> could use anvil in the church to +3
[5:00:50] <Questiy> If you don't explore anywhere, you should get roundtable hold DURING Stormvale
[5:00:51] <iacus_> ah the mimic veil is fun
[5:00:52] <%tempestzephyr> magic's v effective on guy's without shields
[5:00:57] <+TopTieramisu> i definitely got invited to the roundtable at the grace before margit
[5:01:03] <%youngking_kush> @pillagius I keep bringing up Weapon Skill too cuz it took me a while to adjust to using it often
[5:01:05] <user_naim> wait the helmet is a random drop? got it first time lol
[5:01:05] <%cubbywolf> arcane is luck and luck is drop rate
[5:01:17] <iacus_> I got invited before margit but after the Leonine
[5:01:27] <%youngking_kush> Otd definitely encouraged tho
[5:01:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> @user_naim yeeeah I farmed a while to get it, kept getting the other pieces instead
[5:01:28] <JeoDood> arcane can increase bleed poison build up
[5:01:29] <zenith0111> You only get the Roubtable prompt on the 3rd overworld Grace thats not in a dungeon/castle
[5:01:30] <+fizzguy47> @cubbywolf arcan e is also status attack
[5:01:30] <%therustystream> PROP HUNT
[5:01:32] <%cubbywolf> the pvp stabbing
[5:01:32] <iacus_> That item is reusable btw
[5:01:33] <+thillygooth85> Henge no Jutsu
[5:01:35] <scrumbotime> YEAHHHH i love that item!
[5:01:35] <DSD24> Veil's are cool
[5:01:40] <@Menitta> fuckin prop hunt? lol
[5:01:45] <yukichocomilk> LUL
[5:01:45] <+anoldtoilet> its like the bloodborne spell items
[5:01:46] <iacus_> yup
[5:01:50] <zenith0111> "Marikas Mischief"
[5:01:51] <scrumbotime> its a reusable item that uses a tiny bit of fp
[5:01:51] <+kerfufflings> it was an item
[5:01:53] <$weegion29> it works on enemies now
[5:01:57] <+TopTieramisu> @Menitta tbf, it's been in souls games since forever
[5:01:58] <+pectusumbra> Prop Hunt Elden Ring Edition
[5:02:00] <%therustystream> it's pretty funny
[5:02:00] <+AyupaPupa> now just do it whenever
[5:02:04] <+TopTieramisu> hiding as a prop has always been a thing
[5:02:04] <%youngking_kush> "Time for a lesson in trickery"
[5:02:07] <+PkSilent01> @weegion29 wait really
[5:02:10] <+NottaAlotta> really opens camo up to more than just sorc builds
[5:02:12] <@Menitta> LUL
[5:02:13] <%therustystream> PROP HUNT TIME
[5:02:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> Shenanigans
[5:02:14] <$weegion29> ya
[5:02:16] <%Prevot> wow blending in really well
[5:02:17] <+fizzguy47> thats funny
[5:02:20] <+0neReeler> nice
[5:02:22] <%Pillagius> @youngking_kush Yeah, I also initially was very conservative with FP, but then adjusted. Weapon moves are essential to deal with tougher enemies, IMO and much easier than parrying, although that works well too
[5:02:23] <Johannen> or pro invader
[5:02:26] <+Finnmac5> Anti AI too
[5:02:30] <+kerfufflings> i think it fools enemies too
[5:02:31] <+solzan2000> better than snake
[5:02:33] <%itstreylar> it works on regular enemies too
[5:02:34] <DSD24> Woolie looks like he has khaki pants on
[5:02:45] <+TopTieramisu> there's a fun clip of aris turning into a prop to get out of enemy aggro
[5:03:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> what I've started doing is using sacrificial axe in my offhand while 2handing my actual weapon, restore some fp on kill that way
[5:03:02] <+SammyOVision> It's pretty much the metal gear cardboard box
[5:03:07] <+fizzguy47> baited
[5:03:14] <Plughead_> I'm 60 hours in and I still haven't opened that door lmao
[5:03:22] <user_naim> you don’t have the right
[5:03:25] <%youngking_kush> I snuck past a whole min-boss as a box
[5:03:26] <+Krasmeyts> It took me like 100 hours to realize that enemies burst blue like that if they are gonna drop an item...
[5:03:28] <slackerunchained> This break room looks under-decorated. :\
[5:03:30] <Johannen> @Plughead_ Might wanna do some parkour then
[5:03:32] <+solzan2000> why is he wearing GAP jeans?
[5:03:40] <+TopTieramisu> @Krasmeyts mind blown
[5:03:43] <perfect_disaster> I dont know how to open that door
[5:03:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:03:45] <%Ashenik1> @solzan2000  comfy
[5:03:53] <+anoldtoilet> i opened the door and completely forget how
[5:03:57] <+solzan2000> true dat
[5:04:00] <+anoldtoilet> or whats behind it
[5:04:02] <@Moobot> @tacticallysloth 2543 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:04:02] <tacticallysloth> !motivated
[5:04:08] <+kerfufflings> blue means theyre dropping cerualean tears. item drop is white
[5:04:11] <+fizzguy47> @perfect_disaster its in this area
[5:04:12] <zenith0111> @plughead_ Its so easy to forget looking out at these painter like settings that "Oh shit I can jump there"
[5:04:14] <dundore77> you can get therre through a window iirc
[5:04:22] <+segmentedfool> The grafted scion doesn't respawn after you kill it right
[5:04:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> right
[5:04:33] <DSD24> Sneak with your tiny tarnished feet
[5:04:35] <%Prevot> just circle him
[5:04:35] <%youngking_kush> @segmentedfool It does not
[5:04:37] <Johannen> still can backstab
[5:04:54] <%Prevot> backstabs are easy in this game
[5:05:08] <AsheStariel> guard counter poise breaks count as critical
[5:05:08] <+TopTieramisu> bets in chat for what body part will be the motif in the next fromsoft game?
[5:05:10] <Johannen> time for soup
[5:05:18] <%SirGO0SE> @TopTieramisu feet
[5:05:18] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu Brain
[5:05:19] <+TopTieramisu> i'm gonna say tongue
[5:05:19] <coziestbank> time for scooby do
[5:05:20] <JeoDood> still backstab is an option
[5:05:21] <%youngking_kush> @toptieramisu Feet for sure
[5:05:21] <slackerunchained> Can you sneak past the scion?
[5:05:22] <+kerfufflings> @TopTieramisu its always feet
[5:05:33] <DSD24> I like that Axe
[5:05:34] <zenith0111> @toptieramisu Belly Buttons
[5:05:34] <+Jiggisnipe> @TopTieramisu fat asses
[5:05:36] <user_naim> The stomach
[5:05:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> imagine godrick but with a bunch of feet sprouting from his back
[5:05:42] <%youngking_kush> "Why is it always feet?"
[5:06:00] <zenith0111> @awanderingkaivo "Bear Witness!"
[5:06:02] <DSD24> What if they go Hollow Knight and go for Nails?
[5:06:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> Like Rogier, don’t get caught
[5:06:16] <+TopTieramisu> well, this game has a lot of fingernails
[5:06:23] <Johannen> @aWanderingKaivo You mean one Reborn?
[5:06:37] <DSD24> Its a good axe
[5:06:39] <+Krasmeyts> The big ole finger that flicks people is my jam.
[5:06:53] <%whyskeywolfe> FREEDOMMMMMM
[5:06:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> solid length for a 1h axe too
[5:07:01] <+pectusumbra> Bring on the FIGHTS
[5:07:07] <7c_nickel> Seems longer than most 1 handed axes
[5:07:50] <iacus_> Haha
[5:07:54] <+TopTieramisu> oh look, it's the army reggie wanted
[5:07:57] <IronEncore> A good choppa SMOrc
[5:08:16] <%cubbywolf> those ballista are mean
[5:08:32] <berasite> mimic yo. and sneak pass
[5:08:38] <Plughead_> sneaking decreases radius better than you think
[5:08:41] <coziestbank> It's actually the side, you get behind teh balistas by going left
[5:09:04] <Plughead_> did he get the items by the dogs yet?
[5:09:09] <huskarl_zap> first character I had chaded through the front gate up to here. It was awesome
[5:09:26] <%youngking_kush> @woolieversus There's a quest item in the dog room
[5:09:27] <7c_nickel> I knew hed love the Exile fashion
[5:09:28] <dundore77> dont forget the sandbag wall
[5:09:28] <DSD24> @huskarl_zap Man that sounds awesome!
[5:09:42] <%Reveresao> snipe him?
[5:09:47] <+TopTieramisu> i think he notices you
[5:10:00] <coziestbank> Right idea though reggie
[5:10:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> I totally forget how you get to that balcony tbh
[5:10:16] <+fizzguy47> hes facing you
[5:10:18] <dundore77> reggiest right
[5:10:24] <7c_nickel> Its that sandbag wall
[5:10:29] <7c_nickel> its just roundabout
[5:10:31] <%youngking_kush> He wants the smoke
[5:10:32] <+pectusumbra> I'd say try to cheese him from the lower door
[5:10:59] <slackerunchained> I somehow doubt the scion can climb those stairs.
[5:10:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:11:11] <+TopTieramisu> an area that fromsoft has monumentally improved on is making these castles seem like lived spaces

[5:15:02] <%JetpackMcQuack> Elevator life
[5:15:02] <+sandwich_jones> do you do the hanger II? theres a secret tape if u grind the helecopter
[5:15:15] <perfect_disaster> fog gas
[5:15:16] <coziestbank> This is an essential one
[5:15:24] <7c_nickel> SPEND IT
[5:15:25] <%cubbywolf> one imp one key I think
[5:15:30] <%youngking_kush> Very much worth it
[5:15:45] <iacus_> it's always one, no?
[5:15:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> Drowning in keys
[5:15:51] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie felt it LUL
[5:15:51] <+sandwich_jones> the gate upgrades ur trucks
[5:15:52] <%G_Thunders> I’ve yet to run into a gargoyle statue and not have enough stone keys
[5:15:55] <Johannen> You can see if it has 1 or 2 by already places keystones
[5:16:01] <PepperJam_Art> @iacus_ nope
[5:16:04] <%youngking_kush> @iacus_ There ones that cost 2
[5:16:06] <squirtkitten> @iacus_ i swear there is at least one that requires 2 that i ran into
[5:16:07] <+Snazzy_Tomato> bad boys bad boys
[5:16:29] <coziestbank> Now any weapon with an art applied can be STR, DEX, OR QUALIITY
[5:16:31] <+fizzguy47> nice
[5:16:32] <iacus_> ah good to know
[5:16:43] <+sandwich_jones> give em the old slap-a-dap-a-doodle
[5:16:47] <+HefestoForges> band of the hawk shield
[5:16:49] <%youngking_kush> Now you can really customize your weapons
[5:16:57] <+anoldtoilet> this is the ember
[5:16:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> I wish the faith equivalent of this was earlier
[5:17:02] <iacus_> oooh so this is where this was
[5:17:03] <coziestbank> its actually all of them
[5:17:04] <7c_nickel> 1 affinity
[5:17:04] <iacus_> dang
[5:17:05] <%Prevot> nah
[5:17:06] <%commanderclaw> No, choose your affinity
[5:17:09] <%wunp_fxs> these whetstones are always worth it
[5:17:10] <%akajaybay> more like you have more options
[5:17:10] <+Jaromero435> nop
[5:17:13] <+BlandSpice> It's not an extra, it means you can apply it to anything
[5:17:16] <JeoDood> 3
[5:17:17] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> yup
[5:17:19] <%therustystream> you get to choose yeah
[5:17:20] <+fizzguy47> yes
[5:17:22] <coziestbank> Basically all physical affinities are chooses now
[5:17:23] <CapCasual> Woolie is correct.
[5:17:25] <+pectusumbra> every ash now offers heavy, keen, or quality
[5:17:25] <%TheHateFish> All of them can be Keen, Heavy or Quality now
[5:17:27] <JeoDood> yup
[5:17:29] <dundore77> so you can have like the blade spin and it still be a str weapon
[5:17:32] <+eanscrale> It's nice you can get this early
[5:17:33] <+Finnmac5> If you put a holy ash on, you can make it scale more with str for example
[5:17:34] <7c_nickel> yeah, use a fire art with quality scaling for instance
[5:17:37] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> very good item if you're going pure physical
[5:17:41] <+sandwich_jones> oh damn
[5:17:42] <%JetpackMcQuack> Options
[5:17:54] <+fizzguy47> i see he beat the Crucible Knight
[5:17:56] <PepperJam_Art> You can put a magical arts on greatsword and make it quality
[5:17:57] <%SirGO0SE> less than 100 = in the bin you go
[5:17:58] <VincentGraves> Should invest in that lance
[5:18:02] <+sandwich_jones> can u upgrade your board with that and unlock a 900?
[5:18:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:18:15] <+tuchpi> gaskwang
[5:18:16] <slackerunchained> HON HON HON!
[5:18:16] <%commanderclaw> That's a legit ass historical weapon
[5:18:16] <+HefestoForges> 140 crit dagger yay
[5:18:17] <+fizzguy47> dagger
[5:18:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> knoife
[5:18:24] <7c_nickel> damn francophones
[5:18:31] <%youngking_kush> BIG crit dagger
[5:18:34] <+Finnmac5> 140 crit
[5:18:34] <+theoldone001> 140 Crit multiplier
[5:18:35] <%tempestzephyr> a wee wee
[5:18:39] <zenith0111> The Best Crit Weapon in the Whole Game
[5:18:44] <+TopTieramisu> this is for the parry fiends, huh
[5:18:45] <+anoldtoilet> the crit feels somehow even bigger than what it says
[5:18:47] <slackerunchained> Pair that bad boy with a parrying dagger.
[5:18:47] <+pectusumbra> an assassin dagger
[5:18:48] <%SirGO0SE> damn thats a good description
[5:18:52] <+fizzguy47> backstab weapon
[5:18:54] <+anoldtoilet> it does a LOT of backstab and riposte damage
[5:18:58] <agustorm123> Lets goo
[5:19:05] <squirtkitten> could you poise break, switch to this and get the bonus damage?
[5:19:09] <+anoldtoilet> yes
[5:19:11] <+pectusumbra> For those that want a crit/thief kind of build
[5:19:12] <+sandwich_jones> the brits call that a blookie-pookie
[5:19:13] <+HefestoForges> it's the best weapon to switch into for a crit
[5:19:21] <+sandwich_jones> bloakie-pookie
[5:19:32] <agustorm123> The good ol
[5:19:37] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[5:19:50] <+TopTieramisu> those bloodstains are so dark LUL
[5:20:05] <+Krasmeyts> R.E.G system putting it together
[5:20:11] <%SirGO0SE> real fake ladders
[5:20:16] <+sandwich_jones> wall plant up there
[5:20:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> humu humu
[5:20:20] <7c_nickel> Its just a vantage to show that there is a LOW LOW level
[5:20:25] <Plughead_> it's a "look down there" spot
[5:20:38] <zenith0111> You can come above but the fog door wouldve been there
[5:20:39] <+TopTieramisu> it's so much more apparent that there's stuff down there with the bloodstains
[5:20:45] <+TopTieramisu> i've been playing in offline mode
[5:20:49] <Johannen> to put the idea there is more to the bottom of this area
[5:20:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah there is a weird roundabout way to get down there that is not here
[5:21:05] <+fizzguy47> only one way down there
[5:21:09] <truegreed> Pat was pretty on the spot calling these legacy dungeons just entire DS levels monkaS
[5:21:28] <+TopTieramisu> they're basically like demon's souls archstones
[5:21:31] <+TopTieramisu> with their scale
[5:21:35] <+fizzguy47> do it woolz
[5:21:38] <+pectusumbra> Is this graft boy just a one and done? or does he respawn if you kill him?
[5:21:39] <%Prevot> these legacy dungeons are one massive thing BotW lacked
[5:21:42] <%SirGO0SE> monkaS
[5:21:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> Good to be away from torrent for a while
[5:21:49] <%youngking_kush> @truegreed Not joking at all, you could make Dark Souls 4 & 5 out of just the Legacy Dungeons
[5:21:56] <iacus_> @truegreed that's what they are designed as. The From Soft guys said it themselves
[5:21:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> @pectusumbra one and done
[5:22:00] <Johannen> Torrent deserves a break
[5:22:01] <slackerunchained> I wonder if you can just snipe the scion to death from a doorway with a bow and enough arrows?
[5:22:05] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[5:22:08] <Pudgy_Pidgey> monkaS
[5:22:11] <+fizzguy47> @slackerunchained yes
[5:22:14] <truegreed> monkaS
[5:22:19] <tubit> train to zooone
[5:22:21] <Pudgy_Pidgey> He made it through NotLikeThis
[5:22:39] <7c_nickel> All of the Stone Imp heads drop as helmets.  This includes a cat head.
[5:22:40] <+pectusumbra> @pectusumbra Got ya. Might be worth going at him then
[5:23:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> It’s fine
[5:23:03] <+TopTieramisu> this game really does feel like the culmination of all of miyazaki's games
[5:23:05] <iacus_> birds are for scale
[5:23:08] <%SirGO0SE> flocking boids PogChamp
[5:23:10] <slackerunchained> @fizzguy47 Gotta remember that for when I get here, myself. ...TBH, I sorta used some shenanigans to skip Castle Stormveil, here... >.>
[5:23:28] <truegreed> Miyazaki having his entire universe compiled into one game
[5:23:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> @slackerunchained I found that path afterwards and was surprised lol
[5:24:01] <perfect_disaster> fuck me. I didnt see that ladder
[5:24:29] <%Samurai_Jake> and when people mod in all the other games in it will LITERALLY be a culination of all his games
[5:24:32] <%SirGO0SE> the map is so useless in here too LUL

[5:27:59] <%Reveresao> why hasn't he hit the scion with magic?
[5:28:05] <+duckmeat_woohoo> he has
[5:28:08] <+fizzguy47> @reveresao he has
[5:28:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> he did but ran out and died
[5:28:13] <+HairyWario> i'm rocking that dude's helmet, it's cool af
[5:28:14] <+duckmeat_woohoo> but the scion is a chunky boy
[5:28:18] <coziestbank> mini-dungeon complete
[5:28:29] <+Jiggisnipe> he did and then he ran out, then melee then died
[5:28:36] <slackerunchained> I swear, if there's not trading crows SOMEWHERE in this game, I will burn down this giant-ass multi-layer continent. ...Especially Caelid.
[5:28:37] <agustorm123> This place is so big
[5:28:37] <%Reveresao> ah, ok
[5:28:43] <+duckmeat_woohoo> did woolie ever throw a poison dart at the Scion
[5:28:47] <+duckmeat_woohoo> he missed but did he try again
[5:28:59] <Plughead_> you can just teleport back
[5:29:23] <+Krasmeyts> Want your gore chamber to look more classy? Put a chandelier in it.
[5:29:29] <%SirGO0SE> he got the mimic spell chest ya?
[5:29:29] <%radiorosewater> birds should follow
[5:29:38] <@Solidus_113> when enemies explode with those 4 extra white lines, it means they dropped an item
[5:29:42] <+HairyWario> weapon art that dude
[5:29:51] <Trace_Bovier> what level of upgrades are their weapons?
[5:30:03] <@Solidus_113> 0
[5:30:04] <%ssebblue> okay what's with "birds should follow"? lol it was the same thing with Pat
[5:30:06] <BlackermanZX> +0
[5:30:08] <+aWanderingKaivo> curved great sword is 0 yeah
[5:30:11] <Trace_Bovier> oh lol ok
[5:30:20] <%MajorCrasher> ladder
[5:30:22] <Johannen> 0 upgrades, thats just hurts my soul
[5:30:23] <dinkledaberry> ladder
[5:30:27] <dinkledaberry> ladder behind you
[5:30:28] <jacknerik> Woolie is apprehensive about leveling weapons in case he comes across a better one
[5:30:32] <+fizzguy47> already did the ladder
[5:30:39] <JeoDood> they know the ladder there
[5:30:43] <%sherlockkat> I think you can drop, but you take damag.e
[5:30:55] <coziestbank> if it breaks, you break
[5:30:58] <+Krasmeyts> Don't one guy him, sherlockk
[5:31:01] <tacticallysloth> @sherlockkat the stone shattered, meaning he'd die
[5:31:08] <%Reveresao> gotta jump some ledges
[5:31:11] <tacticallysloth> woolie needs to lvl up vigor to make that jump
[5:31:16] <%SirGO0SE> monkaS
[5:31:20] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[5:31:28] <velgaduere> windy boy wants smoke
[5:31:29] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Spinny Wind Boi wants that ass LUL
[5:31:31] <+TopTieramisu> even with gravity nerfed, it's still frightening
[5:31:38] <%sherlockkat> Hmm. Must be misrembering something then. I am pretty sure I dropped down that way. But I also had higher vigor.
[5:31:39] <%akajaybay> can see what the dogs are chewing on
[5:31:44] <+TopTieramisu> and some drops in this game are absolutely baffling
[5:31:54] <+HairyWario> @tacticallysloth are you saying you can land from higher drops with more vigor?
[5:31:57] <+fizzguy47> the gravity in this game is bonkers
[5:32:00] <%youngking_kush> DEX lowers fall damage too
[5:32:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @hairywario and endurance
[5:32:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:32:36] <tacticallysloth> @tacticallysloth at a certain point a jump from "x" height will kill you, but if he levels up a bit he can make that particular jump
[5:32:38] <+TopTieramisu> !MOTIVATAED
[5:32:41] <+HairyWario> @Reverend_Roscoe i wonder whats the max you can jump from
[5:32:41] <BlackermanZX> Elden Pee
[5:32:43] <+HefestoForges> there's a drop in stormveil that is insanely high and you can survive it
[5:32:48] <+PkSilent01> Is the Session over?
[5:32:54] <coziestbank> A lot of people die when they could have avoided because they double jump. Time in air = death
[5:32:54] <%SirGO0SE> go together :)
[5:33:01] <+Reverend_Roscoe> you don't take health damage unless the fall exceeds your stamina threshold
[5:33:02] <+Finnmac5> Homies help each other piss
[5:33:04] <+HairyWario> Oh Reggie, that drank is really good
[5:33:08] <tacticallysloth> @SirGO0SE hold hands
[5:33:09] <+TopTieramisu> there's an insane drop in this game that has absolutely no place being survivable in this game
[5:33:10] <+fizzguy47> @coziestbank shif, really?
[5:33:11] <%livlinn> !uptime
[5:33:11] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 41 minutes
[5:33:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> there's also the assassin's whatever spell and the craftable cotton consumable that lowers fall damage
[5:33:12] <@Solidus_113> everyone go take a piss
[5:33:19] <%livlinn> prenProm prenProm prenProm prenProm prenProm
[5:33:22] <tacticallysloth> group piss in the shower tonite
[5:33:24] <BlackermanZX> SourPls
[5:33:28] <+solzan2000> x23
[5:33:29] <huskarl_zap> no Reggie show
[5:33:29] <%MajorCrasher> oh yeah certain heights will always kill no matter what. I found that out the hard way by testing a "negates all fall damage" talisman
[5:33:30] <jacknerik> God damn it I just got back from getting food
[5:33:32] <+HefestoForges> @aWanderingKaivo and that talisman
[5:33:32] <+solzan2000> <3
[5:33:35] <coziestbank> @fizzguy47 really
[5:33:38] <+Reverend_Roscoe> think Woolie will find the basement?
[5:33:48] <agustorm123> Lets gooo
[5:33:50] <tacticallysloth> @Reverend_Roscoe can we put up a poll?
[5:33:51] <%MajorCrasher> nope
[5:33:57] <+TopTieramisu> @MajorCrasher i'd say that kind of spell is the most useless in this game. the majority of drops either do no damage or kill you
[5:33:58] <%MajorCrasher> he ain't finding it
[5:34:01] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i cannot make polls
[5:34:05] <+TopTieramisu> i mean talisman
[5:34:05] <tacticallysloth> sadge
[5:34:07] <+HefestoForges> @MajorCrasher any fall that makes your character scream is death every time, even with fall immunity
[5:34:08] <+Krasmeyts> @Reverend_Roscoe Pat told him about it, and chat won't let him miss it... prolly not today, though
[5:34:13] <coziestbank> He'll accidentally into it, like most people do
[5:34:15] <%youngking_kush> @reverend_roscoe Reggie will see it
[5:34:22] <agustorm123> Ninjala wait when did that happun?
[5:34:34] <tacticallysloth> ngl reggie coming in clutch on the memory game
[5:34:34] <coziestbank> It's not really "hidden"
[5:34:38] <+Reverend_Roscoe> while they are away, is the basement the same place that the second tree monster is?
[5:34:43] <+Krasmeyts> @agustorm123 check the youtube
[5:34:45] <%MajorCrasher> yeah
[5:34:46] <+HairyWario> Reggie tell Woolie to consider using his cool 10/10 with iframes weapon art
[5:34:47] <agustorm123> Yes
[5:34:47] <+HefestoForges> imagine his surprise when he finds out what is in there LUL
[5:34:49] <%youngking_kush> Yup
[5:34:53] <+TopTieramisu> can you call that a basement?
[5:34:59] <+Reverend_Roscoe> ok. fuck that place.
[5:35:00] <+theoldone001> I feel like Woolie is hollowing out a little
[5:35:02] <Johannen> I also dont get the point of cotton or that spell from high drops, seems utterly useless
[5:35:07] <%youngking_kush> It's more like a sewer lol
[5:35:18] <%SirGO0SE> oooh i just skimmed through the vod to make sure, he did miss the mimic spell chest even though its right in the open
[5:35:26] <%SirGO0SE> it feels like a LOT of players do
[5:35:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> THE WHAT
[5:35:32] <+aWanderingKaivo> what if you went to the castle basement and there was a photograph in it
[5:35:32] <coziestbank> Tarnished that uses cotten and cat tailsman
[5:35:36] <+HefestoForges> mimic spell?
[5:35:41] <Johannen> @HefestoForges He knows, Pat told him on the podcast, unless Woolie blanked it out
[5:35:47] <tacticallysloth> @HefestoForges mimic veil
[5:35:47] <%sherlockkat> @Reverend_Roscoe The second tree monster is at the bottom of the castle.
[5:35:53] <truegreed> It's the camouflage spe;;
[5:36:04] <+HefestoForges> ahh
[5:36:07] <%SirGO0SE> yeah theres a spell in that little room with the fireplace and table that lets you play prophunt
[5:36:08] <coziestbank> Pretty sure its weaker than the imp dungeon one
[5:36:11] <%Shishi1205> Just save scummed to get all the endings
[5:36:22] <%Shishi1205> now popcorn time
[5:36:22] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @sherlockkat it scared the shit out of me and killed me and i haven't been back in 20 hours
[5:36:25] <+HefestoForges> @Johannen I hope he remembers
[5:36:59] <%youngking_kush> @reverend_roscoe you need to beat him for Rogier's quest
[5:37:03] <truegreed> Anyone ever die for being stuck in a free fall state ? Its pretty fun
[5:37:16] <%sherlockkat> @Reverend_Roscoe I would recommend beating it sooner than later for quest reaons.
[5:37:20] <DSD24> Aurelia's her name
[5:37:21] <%livlinn> omnibo3Love
[5:37:24] <%Shishi1205> quit and reload to avoid those deaths
[5:37:28] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[5:37:33] <BlackermanZX> bet
[5:37:36] <coziestbank> Wait Anastasia died?
[5:37:36] <zenith0111> Kappa
[5:37:36] <@Solidus_113> 6 months maybe
[5:37:42] <+Aikao> Forever LP POGGERS
[5:37:45] <+Maleicus> only 11
[5:37:47] <+HairyWario> 10 months tops
[5:37:49] <+Reverend_Roscoe> what the lady died?!
[5:37:50] <OldManDeckardCain> ofc it won't be a 12 month one, it will last for 24
[5:37:55] <%MajorCrasher> he thinks this will end soon LUL
[5:37:57] <%akajaybay> 3 months
[5:37:57] <+PkSilent01> Six months from now, they just killed the 2nd lord
[5:37:57] <zenith0111> Thats 6 months if every boss goes fine
[5:37:58] <%youngking_kush> I'm here for it
[5:37:58] <%G_Thunders> At this rate it’s easily 4 months, if not 6
[5:38:00] <tacticallysloth> 11 and 1/2 months ? :o
[5:38:03] <Trigon_Trey> woolie and elden ring forever 100 seasons
[5:38:05] <coziestbank> Did she die or just leave an item where she was?
[5:38:08] <AncyentMarinere> Plagues will PogChamp
[5:38:23] <+Aikao> Woolie will be killing actual bosses offscreen LUL
[5:38:24] <Johannen> Wanna poke your head into the zone south of Limgrave for offstream content, now that you made progress here?
[5:38:29] <%plsunbanmyacc> pat levels offstream WutFace

[5:38:47] <@Menitta> I wish we could get a full refund
[5:38:50] <%SirGO0SE> just in time for the DLC Kappa
[5:38:52] <crimsonharvest> nah i just past 110 hours and i dont feel done, got a lot of map to go
[5:39:10] <%youngking_kush> As One Piece fan I have ultimate patience lol
[5:39:10] <BlackermanZX> the HxH of LPs
[5:39:14] <+Aikao> I recently discovered i skipped a whole legacy dungeon due to an npc questline :D
[5:39:22] <+HairyWario> im 70 hours in, only started exploring the area after the castle
[5:39:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:39:30] <tacticallysloth> @crimsonharvest made it to the capital last night (after doing ranni/blaidds questline) at 90 hours. love this game
[5:39:34] <+Snazzy_Tomato> the loathsome fart bath
[5:39:48] <OldManDeckardCain> imagine if grrm releases his next book before this lp ends LUL
[5:40:10] <+Krasmeyts> 140 hours in, last dungeon. Doin' cleanup now before New Game.
[5:40:12] <yukichocomilk> @OldManDeckardCain that's be sick
[5:40:18] <+Reverend_Roscoe> DO NOT SPOIL LOGH
[5:40:27] <%TubeMan642> TubeMan642 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! I can't wait for you to see all the Virgil shit that this game has instore. It's wild!
[5:40:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> it super is
[5:40:35] <%AngryAsian5> LOGH is the shit
[5:40:38] <+ds3namecaldara> I don't ng+ so for me it's clean up and new playthrough
[5:40:41] <+eanscrale> IT's the only anime that needs to be that long
[5:40:51] <+anoldtoilet> @youngking_kush lol a lot of the fans stillhave no patience
[5:40:54] <%AngryAsian5> Yeah, but those 110 episodes are actually good
[5:40:56] <iacus_> high praise
[5:41:01] <+anoldtoilet> even though im just like yeah ill ride throuh 1000 more chapters
[5:41:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> Yang is my spirit animal
[5:41:02] <T_Sasquatch> i watched all of hxh , thats as far as im going
[5:41:03] <tacticallysloth> oh shit i missed it, what anime ?
[5:41:05] <@Irridium> 110 episodes zero filler.
[5:41:05] <Johannen> LOGH is great
[5:41:05] <+anoldtoilet> inject it into my veins oda
[5:41:12] <iacus_> Galactic Heores?
[5:41:15] <%youngking_kush> One Piece laughs at you saying 110 episodes is long
[5:41:16] <%MajorCrasher> do you know how long Naruto is? LUL
[5:41:21] <%crybirb> I watched once in a year long coming back from work, planning on rewatching. LOGH is really the best written anime that there is out there.
[5:41:26] <Mr_Zero5232> Tmw the only Twitch channel I follow that aren’t playing Elden Ring are MST3K and MXC and I’m fine with it cause I’m too busy playing Elden Ring
[5:41:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> That's only one season more than AOT
[5:41:29] <+anoldtoilet> evangelion
[5:41:30] <stevenellis386> yup
[5:41:31] <+Captain_sevatar> gurren lagaan
[5:41:34] <tacticallysloth> YES REGGIE
[5:41:37] <tacticallysloth> NO CAP
[5:41:37] <%youngking_kush> Gurren Lagann
[5:41:37] <jam_chamoy> i watched 131 episodes of fairy tail back in the day and gave up on it
[5:41:39] <Shardlab> Brotherhood is the good stuff
[5:41:41] <yukichocomilk> there are many good ones
[5:41:42] <+anoldtoilet> brotherhood is supposed to be really good
[5:41:42] <zenith0111> NODDERS
[5:41:43] <%SirGO0SE> I really really liked Monster
[5:41:43] <Kilikan5670> Brotherhood is lit
[5:41:44] <+askalta> Brotherhood skips a lot of the groundwork
[5:41:45] <%crybirb> I'm rewatching FMA Brotherhood and it's crazy how good it is.
[5:41:45] <iacus_> Eva, Bebop, Gurren Lagann...
[5:41:46] <jam_chamoy> yep brotherhood is good
[5:41:47] <BlackermanZX> not a bad choice
[5:41:48] <iacus_> Gungrave
[5:41:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I guess Madoka could work as well, but it's depressing as hell
[5:41:52] <+anoldtoilet> bebop also perfect yea
[5:41:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> the start to Brotherhood is rough for a newcomer
[5:41:55] <T_Sasquatch> my favorite anime is devil man cry baby
[5:41:56] <+anoldtoilet> digimon tamers >_>
[5:41:59] <Johannen> Its PERFECT
[5:42:01] <+anoldtoilet> devilman crybaby is GREAT
[5:42:03] <stevenellis386> yea gungrave is fun
[5:42:05] <%Prevot> domt let the original FMA truthers hear you say that
[5:42:07] <BlackermanZX> brotherhood is nothing like th OG
[5:42:07] <+askalta> 2003 is my favorite anime and I've been shamed for years
[5:42:12] <+swesterly> i like the short but sweet ones like paranoia agent and flcl
[5:42:22] <Shardlab> Do NOT ever watch the first FMA. It's embarassingly fanfic-esque
[5:42:23] <+anoldtoilet> hmmm
[5:42:25] <iacus_> nice
[5:42:25] <T_Sasquatch> death note is pretty solid too , except ... the end
[5:42:26] <Kilikan5670> It's been awhile, but I still really like Gundam Wing
[5:42:27] <%crybirb> All 110 episodes of LOGH are important, well written and very well developed.
[5:42:28] <%youngking_kush> One Piece is all quality... in the manga
[5:42:28] <+eanscrale> well the whole team was putting gainax into bankruptcy
[5:42:35] <%youngking_kush> The anime not so much lol
[5:42:43] <%SirGO0SE> would I regret watching a dub of LOGH?
[5:42:46] <@Irridium> one of those shows you watch and get sad because nothing else hits like it does
[5:42:48] <+Jiggisnipe> It sounds like Woolie read the fma manga
[5:42:49] <CaptainBright> Do note; LotGH can't be watched too many episodes in a row, as it can be quite dry
[5:42:49] <Kilikan5670> Iron Blooded Orphans as well
[5:42:52] <+anoldtoilet> maybe ill actually watch LOGH finally now that ive read about politics and philosophy and im not 15 and wanting robot fights and NOTHING else
[5:42:53] <%crybirb> LOGH is also good because tons of pretty space bois.
[5:42:55] <jam_chamoy> 2003 fma much slower pace and darker
[5:42:57] <Mr_Zero5232> Fuck yeah
[5:43:00] <+Reverend_Roscoe> MSG 0079 is great
[5:43:06] <Johannen> Legend of the Galactic Heroes has a Bomb Movie to start off that series
[5:43:08] <+Funkyfjord> LoGH is so impossibly good
[5:43:09] <iacus_> no filler, no toy commercial, all quality
[5:43:09] <BlackermanZX> i read the spolers for the next one piece chapter and dear god kolTRIGGERED
[5:43:11] <+AHomeschoolDropout> SPOILERCAST WHEN
[5:43:12] <+eanscrale> it's like gundam without the gundam, and if tomino could actually write.
[5:43:16] <@Irridium> avoid that new anime
[5:43:24] <+anoldtoilet> @BlackermanZX lol yeah bro
[5:43:30] <+anoldtoilet> shit is getting so crazy.
[5:43:33] <Shardlab> The first FMA series just feels like edgy filler if you read the manga
[5:43:33] <CaptainBright> Die Nue These is different from the OG
[5:43:34] <+Krasmeyts> 0083 Stardust Memory is my favorite anime in the Gundam Series.
[5:43:36] <+BananaSlammuh> The new one is good tho. And a god tier theme song
[5:43:36] <%youngking_kush> @blackermanzx I read them, next chapter is crazy
[5:43:37] <stevenellis386> what NEW anime is hot right now?
[5:43:40] <+anoldtoilet> the guy sying "one piece is crazy this week" but its literally every week
[5:43:41] <Mr_Zero5232> Tell me the tale of a people fighting for the right to float in space
[5:43:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> the new remake is.. different, yeah
[5:43:42] <%AngryAsian5> The new one is actually fine. But it's not finished.
[5:43:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Movie is a starting point for the series
[5:43:50] <tacticallysloth> i really enjoyed ironblood orphans ngl
[5:43:50] <%youngking_kush> Kaido currently ballin tf out
[5:43:52] <stevenellis386> thats not AOT or demon slayer?
[5:43:57] <+Funkyfjord> there's like a prequel OVA thats p good to watch first but you don't have to
[5:44:04] <+anoldtoilet> @stevenellis386 mushoku tensei
[5:44:06] <%crybirb> The new one is not good. It's very average.
[5:44:06] <Estwilde> @anoldtoilet True. One Piece has been crazy for months now
[5:44:08] <+anoldtoilet> isekai
[5:44:08] <@Irridium> the movie is pretty good to watch first

[5:46:23] <%Lion_kun> time to back down
[5:46:28] <%MajorCrasher> yes
[5:46:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> We’re back
[5:46:33] <+Jiggisnipe> @mechslayer71 he found Rogier and explored
[5:46:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> POG
[5:46:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> @CaptainBright I have never heard of that one I might have to check that out now
[5:46:35] <+zanz_san> the short bow skill one shots the birds
[5:46:36] <%Lion_kun> hit weeping penisula for easy souls
[5:46:37] <BlackermanZX> dear god upgrade that wep
[5:46:40] <%akajaybay> weapon upgrade and southern land mass and good pre-Godrick moves
[5:46:45] <%thesw1tch> thesw1tch subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! played dmc 5 on Amazon luna. you know how some videos on YouTube or netflix buffer? now turn that into a game
[5:46:48] <+Captain_sevatar> you can just buy them
[5:46:49] <zenith0111> Just use up all those early upgrade mats
[5:46:49] <DatonKallandor> yo wassup
[5:46:49] <glass_marcus> You'll be drowning in sombers soon
[5:46:50] <+Reverend_Roscoe> hit up south of the bridge
[5:46:52] <coziestbank> All upgrades besides final become buyable
[5:46:52] <%MajorCrasher> woolie you can buy smithing stones later
[5:46:53] <iacus_> upgrading to +3 is safe in terms of materials
[5:46:55] <Johannen> Im feeling chat agrees that Weeping Peninsula is a good break
[5:46:57] <BlackermanZX> you can literally bath in these items later
[5:47:01] <%parazoa42> upgrade materials are plentiful, go for it
[5:47:06] <MurseJOCO> @youngking_kush I’ve been staying away from spoilers and the manga for this film but gonna start the manga after the movie for sure
[5:47:07] <@Solidus_113> did woolie end up trying out the carian greatsword art?
[5:47:07] <%youngking_kush> You can get them fairly easily, they turned down alot of the FOMO shit like that in this game @woolieversus
[5:47:10] <Klarrann3> there are so many somber smithing stones that there is no worry about upgrading a few times for any weapon that you're interested in
[5:47:10] <DatonKallandor> has anyone told woolie about putting the cerulean flask on the d-pad shortcuts yet?
[5:47:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe you can even go to +4 at the roundtable
[5:47:18] <Johannen> @DatonKallandor yes
[5:47:22] <DatonKallandor> awesome
[5:47:27] <+anoldtoilet> @DatonKallandor yes, this was recommended last stream i think
[5:47:31] <+anoldtoilet> i tried it and hated it lol
[5:47:31] <DSD24> Eyy we are doing our own Smithing
[5:47:39] <%youngking_kush> @mursejoco You wont be disappointed. The next 2 arcs after where the anime ended are fantastic
[5:47:47] <+anoldtoilet> not a bad upgrade
[5:47:57] <+anoldtoilet> sombers are all 1
[5:48:00] <+aWanderingKaivo> next is a (2)
[5:48:04] <+zanz_san> I still use this sword
[5:48:05] <+Drigoooooo> Vaati's video of getting super buff early is so good
[5:48:06] <@Solidus_113> you'll be fine
[5:48:13] <+Krasmeyts> You'll be fin
[5:48:15] <Klarrann3> yes
[5:48:15] <+anoldtoilet> yes
[5:48:16] <%akajaybay> eventually
[5:48:16] <+Captain_sevatar> Yes
[5:48:17] <truegreed> Yep
[5:48:17] <+zanz_san> yes
[5:48:18] <+Finnmac5> There will be
[5:48:18] <@Solidus_113> eventually yes
[5:48:18] <Klarrann3> also yes
[5:48:18] <%MajorCrasher> yes
[5:48:18] <%youngking_kush> Yes
[5:48:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, a bit later
[5:48:20] <%akajaybay> youll have plenty
[5:48:20] <+anoldtoilet> sort of far away
[5:48:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> unlockable with key items
[5:48:21] <+PARARScs> yes not really
[5:48:21] <+askalta> you'll find it
[5:48:22] <MurseJOCO> @youngking_kush fcking hyped! Can’t wait!
[5:48:22] <%youngking_kush> Yes and yes
[5:48:22] <Dopamien> need bells
[5:48:22] <+ZackSkyy> medium far
[5:48:22] <+PkSilent01> Yes and no
[5:48:24] <DSD24> Its far away
[5:48:26] <disflipmat> You can get there now if you explore
[5:48:26] <+Ghoulgran> For sombers as long as you dont waste the higher ones its ok
[5:48:29] <+Captain_sevatar> Medium far
[5:48:30] <%CisealNine> Yes to both questions.
[5:48:31] <BlackermanZX> not really
[5:48:32] <coziestbank> Yup, the area after Stormveil sells somber 1 and 2
[5:48:34] <Klarrann3> you won't get stuck
[5:48:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you'll be fine
[5:48:36] <@Solidus_113> GAME BIG
[5:48:37] <DatonKallandor> Somber is one specific somber tier for every + level, so it's easy to tell how many you can upgrade
[5:48:38] <+anoldtoilet> you can run to the somber shop right now and the regular stone shop is locked behind a boss.
[5:48:38] <yukichocomilk> you get enough for mulitple weapons just from playing
[5:48:39] <%youngking_kush> Medium far
[5:48:41] <ppangboi> honestly found somber stones more abundant than regular
[5:48:42] <crimsonharvest> if you looked it up you could do the area it tells you
[5:48:44] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Over the course of the early game (40hours) you can keep 2 somber weapons and 3 normal weapons upgraded
[5:48:46] <+thillygooth85> Yes and YES
[5:48:51] <+Jaromero435> you get a good amount of the stones tho
[5:48:55] <@Solidus_113> Game big woolie, don't sweat builds now
[5:48:58] <+fizzguy47> Somber only needs one per level
[5:48:58] <jacknerik> You've been using it for 2 sessions, it's worth it
[5:49:07] <+Finnmac5> You will find smithing stones out the ass exploring mines and stuff later
[5:49:09] <%crybirb> @WoolieVersus There's a bunch of weapons and a bunch of upgrade materials, besides the last upgrade  you shouldn't worry about materials
[5:49:11] <%akajaybay> see you still have the 1 and 2 for another weapon
[5:49:19] <+yeknomlive> you dont use as many sombers
[5:49:19] <+thillygooth85> Somber is for special gear.
[5:49:24] <+anoldtoilet> upgrading your staff makes magic stronger
[5:49:27] <%Deosier> i can safely say you will drown in upgrade mats
[5:49:27] <%Jrockoni> WOOLIE BUFF YOUR WAND
[5:49:28] <+anoldtoilet> jsyk
[5:49:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> upgrading the staff would help the spell game yeah
[5:49:31] <%youngking_kush> If you ever need stones before you can buy them, look for red opening on the map. That's where you'll find stones
[5:49:35] <%RyTYoung> The game is bigger than you’ll ever think it is
[5:49:38] <+fizzguy47> normal smithing needs 12 each to go to next level
[5:49:43] <+mechslayer71> they still being scarce
[5:49:44] <+Drigoooooo> yeah you only commit when you you want to do the final upgrade
[5:49:44] <@Solidus_113> well your still in the starter zone
[5:49:46] <BlackermanZX> oh yeah the wand
[5:49:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> Stones are a problem until they’re not, we’re in phase one
[5:49:46] <%akajaybay> the mining caves tend to have em too
[5:49:47] <+askalta> someone get this man to a mine
[5:49:47] <jacknerik> GOT DAMN
[5:49:49] <+mechslayer71> stop*
[5:49:50] <+Finnmac5> Woolie you will be drowning in them later
[5:49:51] <coziestbank> Mine style dungeons have tons of upgrade items
[5:49:51] <%Shishi1205> you need to find mines woolie
[5:49:53] <+timtheinchanter> Gotta get to the mines
[5:49:56] <jam_chamoy> gotta find mining caves
[5:49:56] <iacus_> have they found the Limgrave Tunnels?
[5:49:58] <BlackermanZX> you literally sill in Limgrave
[5:49:59] <+casy_fair> there's a bunch of caves you can find smithing stones in
[5:50:00] <Johannen> Weeping Peninsula time?
[5:50:00] <iacus_> I see they haven't
[5:50:01] <+eanscrale> You have to go into caves mostly
[5:50:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> they're scarce, but you ARE still in hour 1 progress wise
[5:50:04] <crimsonharvest> dont worry about it, runes will become the limiter soon enough
[5:50:05] <JonOButler> heh
[5:50:05] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you saw those 2nd and 3rd maps, those are also full of caves
[5:50:06] <+tuchpi> you just have to look for mines on the map
[5:50:06] <Klarrann3> I've found it harder to upgrade the regular weapon because of how scarce the regular stones are
[5:50:08] <CaptainBright> At this rate, Woolie will actually hit the 500 hour mark
[5:50:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> Feast or famine
[5:50:09] <%Prevot> thats cause you havent even got past the 1st boss yet
[5:50:19] <+mechslayer71> jesus, he's 48 hours in NOW? this is gonna be 200 hours easy for woolie with this pace
[5:50:21] <+yeknomlive> it's ok to make mistakes. I one time upgrade a somber to +5 used, used it once and never used it again
[5:50:27] <+tuchpi> @Prevot you can get a ton before, it doesnt matter LUL
[5:50:29] <+mechslayer71> or more quite frankly
[5:50:42] <+eanscrale> wait he's level 40!
[5:50:48] <tacticallysloth> @Prevot dude for realy lol i love woolie's gameplay but he's gonna have a hard time NOT making a year long LP at this pace
[5:50:50] <Johannen> @mechslayer71 more like 300
[5:50:56] <BlackermanZX> worst mistake you can do is not doing upgrades and getting more hp
[5:50:57] <slackerunchained> If you know how to find the 'mining caves' on the map, it's possible to eak out a good number of smithing stones of both types early.
[5:51:03] <%youngking_kush> Yeah he's got the levels for Stormveil, literally just needed the weapon upgrade
[5:51:09] <Shazzlnet> I'm 200 hours in and I'm only a little past getting my 4th talisman slot
[5:51:18] <DatonKallandor> gonna be a *while* till you get a new staff
[5:51:26] <+tuchpi> 20 smithing stone 1s LUL
[5:51:32] <+anoldtoilet> its a weird drop rate. its going to be a while and then youll get a lot of staffs
[5:51:33] <%youngking_kush> You'll find them to the North
[5:51:33] <+Captain_sevatar> yeah its gonna be a while till your next staff
[5:51:33] <+HefestoForges> you'll find many soon tho
[5:51:35] <zenith0111> The starting weapons are pretty dec
[5:51:35] <coziestbank> there's a really strong staff in that teleport trap mine
[5:51:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pump it Kreygasm
[5:51:39] <DatonKallandor> you'll have plenty of staves when you get your respec, but before that? forget about staves
[5:51:42] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus I can point you to the direction of a great staff you can grab off screen later
[5:51:44] <Johannen> Still in the Limgrave 40 hours in, that might be the reason)
[5:51:50] <%MajorCrasher> if you don't mind spoilers there's a great staff that's easy to get right now
[5:51:52] <tacticallysloth> @DatonKallandor he could just go on an adventure to the east and find an S scaling staff in some ruins but >.>
[5:51:53] <slackerunchained> Also, having a higher arcane for better enemy drops helps somewhat, I confess.
[5:52:01] <+Krasmeyts> Worry not Woolie, upgrades are cheap
[5:52:13] <%akajaybay> gotta vist the roundtable boy
[5:52:16] <DatonKallandor> running to strong upgrades early by looking it up is cheating and boring, I'm glad he's not doing it
[5:52:25] <zenith0111> Its open world the mats are easier to find if anything
[5:52:27] <%youngking_kush> Yup, you need an actual Blacksmith past +3
[5:52:28] <DatonKallandor> the fun part is finding new gear naturally
[5:52:28] <Johannen> Lets go Peninsula
[5:52:35] <yukichocomilk> you'll be fine, you get plenty of mats
[5:52:47] <jam_chamoy> maybe might stumble to find a great early staff near a great spell who knows
[5:52:49] <squirtkitten> @DatonKallandor its not cheating m8y
[5:52:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you would be unnecessarily suffering against Godrick with +0 anyway
[5:52:54] <Klarrann3> you get DOZENS of the early somber stones
[5:52:57] <@Solidus_113> also, did you try out the magic greatsword weapon art? you bought it but I didn't see it used
[5:52:57] <tacticallysloth> who said anything about looking it up? but i feel ya, just at almost 50 hours it's a snail pace lol
[5:53:27] <+Jiggisnipe> reset that

[5:53:48] <DSD24> "what was that noise"
[5:53:52] <+swesterly> it is possible to get mid to late game upgrade materials almost immediately, just make a point to get them during the offscreen time and the lp will be fine

[5:56:08] <@Solidus_113> :)
[5:56:08] <+Drigoooooo> Woolie deprived us content
[5:56:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> Dangerous place
[5:56:12] <+Krasmeyts> :)
[5:56:13] <slackerunchained> He will TOTALLY respawn.
[5:56:14] <WoawDesu> :)
[5:56:17] <+TeeSeeDubs> :)
[5:56:20] <%shadowsofpain> I want a refund for the lack of balls exposed
[5:56:21] <DatonKallandor> tourist tarnished with the flip flops
[5:56:24] <Johannen> Can we nudge Woolie to explore South Peninsula so he can make more progress offstream?
[5:56:27] <BlackermanZX> this is fromsoft we talkin about
[5:56:33] <@Solidus_113> @Johannen no
[5:56:37] <iacus_> no
[5:56:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> an entire tree
[5:56:40] <%youngking_kush> He'll get there
[5:56:41] <+BananaSlammuh> basically if they don't drop an item in a prompt I assume they are going to respawn
[5:56:42] <tacticallysloth> lmao
[5:56:43] <iacus_> progress must be done on-air
[5:56:48] <%akajaybay> The big courtyard with all the folks. theyre dumb though and looking one way
[5:56:59] <tacticallysloth> HEY
[5:57:00] <+Krasmeyts> :)
[5:57:00] <%Prevot> I think woolie assumed the peninsula is an actual new are, like Liurnia
[5:57:01] <Pistofficer> cant head shot a headless man! tactical
[5:57:01] <%SirGO0SE> maybe :)
[5:57:09] <%youngking_kush> You dont wanna try and lead in a direction, just let Woolz go wherever and then drop tips as relevant
[5:57:13] <%shadowsofpain> @johannen Woolie will figure it out (tm)
[5:57:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @tacticallysloth
[5:57:17] <%youngking_kush> That's what I try to do anyway
[5:57:20] <tacticallysloth> sorry moobot :(
[5:57:27] <KobeTeeth90> can we nudge woolie to do a hot tub stream?
[5:57:28] <Johannen> @iacus_ Yeah but he wont touch it until they explore it on stream, until the next stream he will have nothing to do prety much
[5:57:35] <tacticallysloth> @KobeTeeth90 yes?
[5:57:47] <%CateHecate> sword big good now
[5:57:50] <+Krasmeyts> Can we nudge a hottub to do a Woolie Stream?
[5:57:51] <iacus_> well the peninsula is a separate area in maps etc
[5:57:56] <tacticallysloth> @Krasmeyts mind blown
[5:57:58] <DSD24> DOOT
[5:58:02] <%SirGO0SE> 📯
[5:58:09] <@Solidus_113> for whom the doot tolls
[5:58:12] <DatonKallandor> important information that maybe gets lost to veterans making assumptions: different weapons in the same weapon type can have *wildly* different movesets
[5:58:14] <DSD24> The assists
[5:58:30] <Pistofficer> anyone else start pumping VIT after the podcast talks?
[5:58:32] <+0neReeler> still no crouch tech
[5:58:34] <tacticallysloth> doing big damage now hell yeah
[5:58:39] <@Solidus_113> bonus runes
[5:58:41] <+mechslayer71> extra souls
[5:58:41] <mikesapartment> yellow eyes = rune bonus
[5:58:41] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Extra Runes
[5:58:41] <%SirGO0SE> yellow eyes 2x runes
[5:58:42] <%akajaybay> higher drop chances I think
[5:58:43] <KobeTeeth90> yellow eyes mean heasJauntish
[5:58:43] <iacus_> gold eyes means they drop 4x runes
[5:58:44] <DatonKallandor> yellow = 5x rune multiplier
[5:58:46] <%shadowsofpain> he drops extra souls
[5:58:46] <+CrystalTree07> 5x runes
[5:58:48] <+TeeSeeDubs> Bonus runes
[5:58:48] <+HefestoForges> yellow eyes = 5x runes
[5:58:49] <squirtkitten> @DatonKallandor i imagine that only applies to very unique ones, i tried every colossal hammer i could find and they all did the same attack animation
[5:58:50] <%SirGO0SE> 5x?!
[5:58:51] <iacus_> or 5x
[5:58:53] <+tuchpi> it's way more than 2x
[5:58:54] <%youngking_kush> Yellow Eyes = 5x Runes
[5:58:54] <tacticallysloth> parkour
[5:58:57] <mikesapartment> its 5x
[5:58:58] <%CateHecate> the gout
[5:59:05] <+TopTieramisu> are the enemies any stronger?
[5:59:10] <+TopTieramisu> when they have yellow eyes
[5:59:15] <+Drigoooooo> no just more runes
[5:59:19] <%youngking_kush> @toptieramisu I dont think so
[5:59:19] <+TopTieramisu> ok
[5:59:26] <tacticallysloth> @TopTieramisu don't think so, but there's ones with red eyes that have more hp iirc
[5:59:30] <DatonKallandor> @squirtkitten sometimes it's very innocent weapons - the straight swords that drop off the murder eagles have a unique moveset for example
[5:59:34] <squirtkitten> also if you see a group of travelling nobles, and one has a chest it drops a consumable rune
[5:59:41] <DatonKallandor> and there's weapons with guard-points in their moveset too
[5:59:44] <%akajaybay> bird up
[5:59:48] <+Krasmeyts> @TopTieramisu I think red eyes might be stronger, gold is more runes and Yellow means get the fuck out.

[6:00:00] <+anoldtoilet> @DatonKallandor yeah i almost lost my shit when i noticed this on a carian sword

[6:00:06] <%shadowsofpain> bird down
[6:00:06] <squirtkitten> @DatonKallandor i wouldve expected a giant anchor to have a differfent attack animation than a hunk of wood but the budget was focused elsewhere
[6:00:15] <%radiorosewater> so uhh
[6:00:25] <DatonKallandor> look, people that swing hammers are simple people they don't need fancy "animations"
[6:00:36] <tacticallysloth> so motivated right now
[6:00:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:00:41] <+anoldtoilet> the giant anchor is a giant hammer that does pierce damage, you want *animations* too?
[6:00:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> test out every weapon moveset on pickup, this is the way
[6:00:56] <%SirGO0SE> @squirtkitten i use the anchor in my off hand and it kicks ass
[6:00:58] <+Krasmeyts> Very glad he found this

[6:04:19] <%CateHecate> QUICK WOOLIE USE THE SYNCHRONIZE POINT
[6:04:22] <%youngking_kush> It does less damage tho
[6:04:43] <Johannen> @youngking_kush Yeah i was about to say that, not realy any point to backstab
[6:05:07] <+fizzguy47> there's a lot of exploration in Stormveil if you have the hankering

[6:18:02] <+fizzguy47> depends on the enemy and weapon
[6:18:04] <+TopTieramisu> i find stormveil more convoluted than the next big dungeon
[6:18:05] <%Shishi1205> difficult on invaders
[6:18:05] <Johannen> its not consistent yeah
[6:18:06] <%therustystream> yup don't have to delay it most of the time
[6:18:08] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah depends on the weapon especially
[6:18:11] <+yeknomlive> depends. on some weapons I delay it
[6:18:13] <DatonKallandor> some weapons are too fast and some enemies are invulnerable on wakeup
[6:18:26] <+anoldtoilet> all enemies seem to have variable wakeup timing
[6:18:27] <perfect_disaster> he has a hood!
[6:18:29] <+Tetherline> The scimitar R2 is a two hit attack and only the second hit will land if you start it instantly
[6:18:29] <+anoldtoilet> well not ALL
[6:18:32] <%youngking_kush> I always assume it's because the game queues your inputs
[6:18:33] <+fizzguy47> Miyazaki seething
[6:18:34] <+anoldtoilet> but enemy types at least
[6:18:38] <DatonKallandor> yeah this one is wearing the cool version of the armor
[6:18:40] <berasite> LUL good old from
[6:18:44] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Yeah, no follow up LUL
[6:18:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> farmed this guy for like an hour for the hooded helmet, only to not find a chest piece that goes good with it NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis csbeastSetIn

[6:20:06] <%shadowsofpain> get some silver feet, I'm sure Reggie would love them
[6:20:09] <+pectusumbra> find someone that sells the silver chicken feet I guess
[6:20:10] <stardustcrusad3r> D.A.R.E. but for magic
[6:20:15] <+aWanderingKaivo> I dunno about the hooded guy but the normal ones drop all their gear
[6:20:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> 3 ways to level up in this game: 1. your stats, 2. your gear, 3. your gameplay
[6:20:30] <+Shoosler> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ it took me about 60 - 75 minutes to farm the one at the dragon communion place today. was able to get the full set but the chest piece was the rarest. have like 8 of each of the others
[6:20:33] <+0neReeler> waitforit

[6:21:11] <%CateHecate> let's partyyyyyyyyyyyy
[6:21:24] <%youngking_kush> Why is there a fog gate there
[6:21:36] <CaptainBright> Opposite side; Stonesward key door
[6:21:38] <truegreed> It's a stonekey door
[6:21:41] <zenith0111> Bit confusing from the apth you took
[6:21:43] <%youngking_kush> Oohhhh
[6:21:43] <Johannen> scorpion?balistae?
[6:21:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[6:21:46] <+BadCoupon> imp statue gate probably
[6:21:50] <+Xelphi> its past the sion room
[6:21:50] <mikesapartment> try rear
[6:21:52] <%youngking_kush> I came at from the other side
[6:21:54] <%Reveresao> wrong side
[6:21:56] <+Shoosler> luckily he's literally right next to the grace there and you can sneak up and backstab him and get maybe 3 kills per minute if you're really quick @KosOrSomeSayKosm_
[6:21:57] <CaptainBright> good luck hall wugging
[6:22:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> the front gate
[6:22:08] <+Vikingdeath1> this particular fog gate confused me for a while
[6:22:12] <%therustystream> have fun at this part
[6:22:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> this is the preparty
[6:22:16] <iacus_> precisely
[6:22:28] <+OniOniOniiii> what a great level
[6:22:28] <%CateHecate> there are 3 entire parties crammed in here

[6:22:33] <%RyTYoung> Yup
[6:22:38] <KingOfTheGeats> he does warn you at least
[6:22:40] <%CateHecate> yokoso
[6:22:47] <+Drigoooooo> go in the man mode way
[6:22:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Shoosler yeah, there are a couple instances where the dude is close to a grace, it's a godsend
[6:22:48] <+Krasmeyts> And he'd never betray you, right?
[6:22:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[6:22:51] <Johannen> he gave you the easy way past them
[6:22:51] <+Krasmeyts> Twice?
[6:22:55] <+darkfoxxs> LOL yea
[6:22:56] <%akajaybay> theyre oblivious
[6:23:00] <%ssebblue> i didn't trust the guy and went Leeroy Jenkins here anyways LUL
[6:23:00] <%Bread_Assassin> TBF, he warned you that would happen.
[6:23:02] <squirtkitten> has woolie committed to not reading chat? im curious about a question but dont know if it counts as a spoil or not in case he sees it
[6:23:05] <+darkfoxxs> He was a nice guy you just don’t listen
[6:23:08] <%CateHecate> oleg!
[6:23:13] <%akajaybay> lots of farming for these directional guards
[6:23:13] <%ssebblue> nothing a little rolling can't solve B)

[6:23:44] <+OniOniOniiii> they arent paid enough to jump
[6:23:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KosOrSomeSayKosm_

[6:24:35] <Johannen> its true 5x
[6:24:49] <alexandrecau> he is at the main gate
[6:25:18] <%akajaybay> i told the gate guy i was going in the front until he got them to open it, then went the side way
[6:25:22] <+ds3namecaldara> Can I get the name of a early farm spot? I'll figure it out from their
[6:25:37] <alexandrecau> there is a grace site  where he was
[6:25:41] <%CateHecate> buss out the boy
[6:25:43] <+fizzguy47> this is a sneaking mission
[6:25:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> welcoming party
[6:25:48] <alexandrecau> but not worth the respawn
[6:26:02] <available_line> Not feeling very welcomed.
[6:26:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> if only...
[6:26:12] <%ssebblue> i went the total opposite direction Woolie has gone haha i had ZERO faith in the gate keeper

[6:29:05] <available_line> mooooor health
[6:29:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ds3namecaldara just summon your +10 oleg and let him do the dirty work Kappa
[6:29:08] <satiresatyr> !uptime
[6:29:08] <@Moobot> @satiresatyr WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 6 hours and 37 minutes
[6:29:14] <CaptainBright> kill something outside
[6:29:15] <oedocontroller> everybody memes on miyazaki's obsession with poison swamps, but can we acknowledge that this game has like 20 castles?
[6:29:16] <alexandrecau> At least the bat castle has big key item
[6:29:17] <%SirGO0SE> @satiresatyr it changes how it looks a bit depending on the helmet youre using too
[6:29:18] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @ds3namecaldara yo fuck that place
[6:29:21] <%SirGO0SE> its tight
[6:29:23] <satiresatyr> big stream OWOH
[6:29:25] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i lost 100k there
[6:29:30] <velgaduere> 14 vigor is spooky
[6:29:32] <+fizzguy47> yup
[6:29:43] <alexandrecau> poise for lifebar not like you'll ever drop your shield
[6:29:47] <+AnIrishPapaya> nahhhhh vigor is fine. I went with 12 vigor until lvl 80
[6:29:47] <perfect_disaster> 18 for me was good enough
[6:29:48] <jacknerik> Vigor should be in your top 3 stats, no matter what.
[6:29:52] <satiresatyr> @SirGO0SE oh i like that omg :)
[6:30:01] <mrtanaka111> we getting to godrick today?
[6:30:08] <Johannen> no way
[6:30:13] <dundore77> you'll want to kill those bastilla guys first again
[6:30:16] <%therustystream> maybe right outside his door lol
[6:30:21] <+Drigoooooo> Vigor should be high if your melee
[6:30:29] <CaptainBright> godrick today? at this rate?
[6:30:30] <+fizzguy47> godrick is not far from here
[6:30:31] <CaptainBright> naaaahhhhhhh
[6:30:32] <alexandrecau> There is a big cat ahead
[6:30:32] <+FadingEmber> I am at 17 vigor at level 83 and its no get a single point until I can do more cool shit
[6:30:35] <%therustystream> useful for later
[6:30:40] <available_line> @AnIrishPapaya Same. Just started leveling it now that I beat the godskin dude boss.
[6:30:41] <%therustystream> although you already got the grace
[6:30:43] <%youngking_kush> I had 20 Vigor for my first like 60 hours
[6:30:55] <%Ashenik1> @youngking_kush  HOW?!
[6:30:57] <dundore77> wow ive missed that
[6:30:58] <mrtanaka111> i capped 30 on all stats asap
[6:31:09] <%youngking_kush> @ashenik1 INT/DEX build
[6:31:10] <+fizzguy47> hahaa
[6:31:10] <@Menitta> lol I'm sub 20
[6:31:13] <%akajaybay> explains the neck thing
[6:31:16] <+AnIrishPapaya> @available_line yeah, I basically went 12 vigor until boss piss attacks started to one shot
[6:31:25] <mrtanaka111> 20 arcane really helps with farming items
[6:31:33] <+TeeSeeDubs> Still my armor
[6:31:35] <%ssebblue> rushing vigor was essential for me... i leveled to 26 before i dumped stats into anything else while talismens let me use weapons
[6:31:37] <%youngking_kush> I didnt start leveling VIG until I went to fully explore to the East
[6:31:41] <+Drigoooooo> yeah most bosses later on will one shot constantly
[6:31:46] <alexandrecau> I'm at 15 vigor but can block anything godrick can throw
[6:31:46] <Johannen> actual faith increase
[6:31:46] <+Krasmeyts> Gives 1 faith, neat
[6:31:48] <+fizzguy47> it increases Faith stat, wtf
[6:31:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> by 1
[6:32:08] <%Ashenik1> @youngking_kush  you mean Caelid?
[6:32:10] <satiresatyr> i like the layout of the clothes
[6:32:10] <zenith0111> They give lots of stat increade attire this time around
[6:32:11] <available_line> @AnIrishPapaya Yeah. I tried doing Radahn and he sniped me 10 time in a row. I'll hit 20 then see what happens.
[6:32:13] <oedocontroller> nothing weird there
[6:32:18] <+theoldone001> As someone at the end of the game, trust me when I say 25 to 30 Vigor doesn't cut it anymore. I was getting one shotted by late game bosses at 40.
[6:32:22] <%youngking_kush> @ashenik1 Yeah, didnt want to say the name lol
[6:32:27] <%ssebblue> just 23 for faith for the Cipher Pata B)
[6:32:34] <+AnIrishPapaya> @available_line yep, that was the fight that made me pump some into vit
[6:32:39] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i can get radahn to phase 2, but then i get smoked
[6:32:44] <KingOfTheGeats> this fucker
[6:32:47] <+vaderxyz1970> Looks like u wearing white stockings
[6:32:49] <%Ashenik1> @youngking_kush  i dont think its a spoiler though LUL
[6:32:53] <@Solidus_113> merchant?
[6:32:57] <+0neReeler> oh... you're safe..
[6:33:02] <oedocontroller> that's a guy you talk to before opening that game xD
[6:33:03] <@Solidus_113> damn I missed that
[6:33:04] <%ssebblue> yo whattttt
[6:33:04] <%youngking_kush> Once you guys find a certain item that give you a benefit but at a cost you should definitely use it
[6:33:05] <%SirGO0SE> this guy is a surprising bro
[6:33:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> need 30 for cipher
[6:33:10] <mikesapartment> :)
[6:33:10] <%akajaybay> you can have it both ways
[6:33:10] <Johannen> why?
[6:33:11] <%BestTeaMaker> wait
[6:33:12] <alexandrecau> selling stuf he stole from you
[6:33:14] <%BestTeaMaker> he's a shop??
[6:33:14] <+Drigoooooo> I mean you still can kill him
[6:33:15] <+0neReeler> patches 2?
[6:33:16] <+fizzguy47> damn woolie
[6:33:16] <%youngking_kush> I did not know he was a shop lol
[6:33:16] <%whyskeywolfe> YOU A SHOP
[6:33:19] <Johannen> What he do?
[6:33:21] <+Jiggisnipe> so he's Patches again
[6:33:23] <+mechslayer71> did they find out what he did?
[6:33:24] <mrtanaka111> no mercy for traitors
[6:33:25] <truegreed> SCAM
[6:33:27] <+AnIrishPapaya> I mean, you can steal anyone's "shop" in this game
[6:33:27] <zenith0111> WHAT'RE BUYIN
[6:33:28] <+pectusumbra> I mean let's not get hasty.
[6:33:29] <+TopTieramisu> BUCKLER
[6:33:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> wait what he's shop???
[6:33:31] <pricklypissant> If you're not an enemy why do I see a health bar?
[6:33:31] <%youngking_kush> I came back and found him dead
[6:33:32] <+0neReeler> just a joke bro
[6:33:32] <+scarman125> does Woolie not know about Bell Bearings?
[6:33:35] <+pectusumbra> You might kill him anyway
[6:33:36] <coziestbank> FUN FACT: Shopkeepers drop bells you can give the lady at the roundtable to use their shops after death
[6:33:37] <+NottaAlotta> caestus
[6:33:38] <%espanishcanamurciana> NFT FOR SALE
[6:33:38] <%edgeroth> buckler is very nice
[6:33:38] <oedocontroller> no, this game has  actual patches somewhere else
[6:33:39] <+Krasmeyts> Fist and kill?
[6:33:40] <+Grayhammatter> caestus
[6:33:44] <prime_name> invasion item
[6:33:44] <zenith0111> BUCKLER
[6:33:45] <%ssebblue> are the feet good?
[6:33:46] <+swesterly> @scarman125 evidently not
[6:33:47] <+Nekros4442> woolie, shops drop bell bearings in this game
[6:33:49] <%ssebblue> the bird feet i mean
[6:33:50] <+fizzguy47> he sells the Bandit set, interesting
[6:33:52] <alexandrecau> endure
[6:33:56] <iacus_> we punchmommin'
[6:34:01] <+theoldone001> Caestus are actually legit in this game
[6:34:01] <genmypoweralready> Buckler kinda bad
[6:34:01] <%illicitdonut> ...murder him
[6:34:07] <+fizzguy47> no mask though
[6:34:11] <Johannen> So, why is Woolie mad at him? Didnt he show him the safer way around?
[6:34:19] <zenith0111> BUCKLER PARRY IS DIFFERENT
[6:34:19] <BlackermanZX> shank him anyways
[6:34:20] <+Proxzo> Dear Strongbad, how do you Tarnished with boxing gloves on.
[6:34:23] <%SirGO0SE> i think this was the only vendor i found early that had great bolts/arrows
[6:34:30] <+AnIrishPapaya> @johannen he steals runes every time you die in Stormveil
[6:34:30] <oedocontroller> even if you killed him, woolie, he would still be a shop, just somewhere else xD
[6:34:33] <+Krasmeyts> @Johannen and tried to kill him, and stole his runes, but yaknow
[6:34:34] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @johannen locked him in a cell with a monster
[6:34:36] <alexandrecau> If you follow his exact orders he locks you with a knight
[6:34:39] <+anoldtoilet> yeah buckler parry is OD in this game
[6:34:41] <zenith0111> 15 Active Frames
[6:34:42] <+Drigoooooo> nah he screws you over constantly here and even locks you in a room
[6:34:48] <%Reveresao> leave him, what does he later is great
[6:34:51] <yukichocomilk> i'm not a fan of parrying, too much risk
[6:35:12] <%ssebblue> he locks you in regardless even if you didn't follow his advice~
[6:35:13] <Johannen> Huh, i never thought its him that trapped me in the room, never noticed rune stealing
[6:35:15] <alexandrecau> He is a shop now so you can have his scene later
[6:35:20] <+fizzguy47> i think some of the shield arts are restricted to shield type
[6:35:24] <alexandrecau> instead of killing right away
[6:35:28] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @yukichocomilk True skill is not swayed by luck
[6:35:30] <+pupil31> LUL
[6:35:32] <%livlinn> LUL
[6:35:34] <velgaduere> USED toilet paper
[6:35:35] <iacus_> but so cool tho
[6:35:35] <BlackermanZX> accurate
[6:35:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's a hustle

[6:35:50] <+fizzguy47> yo, don't shit on the bandit set alright
[6:35:57] <genmypoweralready> You're not paying for the bathwater you're paying for the essence of the person who wore it before
[6:35:59] <iacus_> they didn't talk with this guy before?
[6:36:06] <+heyitsbrian> doesn't this guy drop a bead that moves his shop to the hub?
[6:36:09] <oedocontroller> apparently not
[6:36:17] <+AnIrishPapaya> Does Woolie know about bell bearings?
[6:36:27] <+Drigoooooo> no he does not
[6:36:27] <+Krasmeyts> @heyitsbrian but there's that other reason not to
[6:36:29] <+fizzguy47> @iacus_ they found him here again
[6:36:36] <+SkiLLeTxl> Nope
[6:36:43] <+AnIrishPapaya> interesting
[6:36:52] <+AnIrishPapaya> I shall hush
[6:36:53] <%SirGO0SE> i wish you could close the gates back up
[6:36:54] <zenith0111> QA time
[6:36:56] <+0neReeler> hooh
[6:37:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh
[6:37:03] <perfect_disaster> he is honest
[6:37:10] <alexandrecau> Go to the main gate he'll open them
[6:37:13] <+Arnoldoaad1> QA test
[6:37:15] <alexandrecau> and you'll get fucked
[6:37:16] <+heyitsbrian> @Krasmeyts oh is there?  I hope it's nothing past what I'm aware of
[6:37:23] <linSP> I went through the main gates, took me two tries
[6:37:27] <+darkfoxxs> Lmao HE WARNED YOU
[6:37:38] <%therustystream> he's a weirdo but he's been honest the whole time
[6:37:38] <dundore77> why are you hostile to him? he's honest in what he said. the side still has people just much less of them
[6:37:53] <zenith0111> Trusting FromSoft NPCs LUL
[6:37:58] <%SirGO0SE> @linSP i tried to greatbow the sentries but theyre too far away :(
[6:37:59] <TheProtomanBlues> Do NOT kill him for a cool interaction
[6:38:00] <VincentGraves> apparently he steals a percent of your runes every time you die
[6:38:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> and the side doesn't have like 7 super ballistae pointed at you
[6:38:16] <+Drigoooooo> he for sure is not on your side
[6:38:18] <Johannen> you gotta have a bcakup plan, cant be 100% traitor, what if it fails
[6:38:20] <+fizzguy47> @zenith0111 this game and trusting NPCs
[6:38:33] <VioletRosefall> oh they respawn?
[6:38:38] <%Reveresao> he steals about 30% of your runes
[6:39:05] <%Ashenik1> I think you can destroy the balistas
[6:39:09] <crimsonharvest> can you turn on the lamp please when you get a minute
[6:39:16] <+TopTieramisu> but you can't use the ballistas
[6:39:19] <+TopTieramisu> infinite sadge
[6:39:24] <+Krasmeyts> do the balistas respawn on sit? never tested it myself
[6:39:27] <%Ashenik1> sadge
[6:39:30] <+TeeSeeDubs> Holy

[6:39:56] <+TopTieramisu> anti-stand tech
[6:40:00] <%SirGO0SE> consumable only run seems hella fun
[6:40:02] <+fizzguy47> @ashenik1 probabhow do you break them
[6:40:26] <%akajaybay> must be the wind
[6:40:29] <dundore77> if you hit them enough they break but pretty sure they still come back on sit at least the other ones ive tested they do idk about here
[6:40:55] <+Krasmeyts> Chat, do we have an agreed upon spelling for Woolie's character's scream? Its pretty goofy
[6:40:56] <%Ashenik1> @fizzguy47  how do you kill an apostole guts style? SMASH
[6:40:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah they can break, not much reason to though since you can just kill the operators
[6:41:04] <alexandrecau> those repair themselves on sit too tried it when went to the divine tower
[6:41:30] <oedocontroller> you can destroy the crossbows and they don't come back on grace reset
[6:41:46] <+fizzguy47> bypassing them is the faster way
[6:41:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> (you can summon btw)
[6:41:59] <alexandrecau> also summon wolves

[7:04:47] <+tnomads> the options switching up skills brings to PvP is crazy
[7:04:50] <%slipdog> thats usually how my memory goes
[7:04:52] <dds333a> that stance reset LUL

[7:05:19] <+pectusumbra> and uses regular upgrade materials
[7:05:22] <+HexLotus> I love the ash of war system it’s so tight
[7:05:24] <%Namillus> @Namillus I thought so
[7:05:25] <%youngking_kush> @namillus No cuz Caestus is already a twin weapon
[7:05:26] <Aussie_Manny> I just hope good damage is viable on Caestus, through upgrades and stuff.
[7:05:29] <dds333a> @zenith0111 GO TO HEAVEN
[7:05:34] <+fizzguy47> is there a different move set for dual wielding fist weapons?
[7:05:42] <+pectusumbra> I imagine those would be GREAT for putting on status
[7:05:44] <%slipdog> woolieSHOOKREG woolieSHOOKREG
[7:05:48] <stevenellis386> fuck thats gonna be my goal when I get this game.Master the cestus
[7:05:54] <Aussie_Manny> I want Caestus to at least be as strong as swords or daggers.
[7:05:55] <dds333a> It's a vista
[7:05:57] <+Drigoooooo> the damage is good if you go STR but the big issue is the range
[7:05:57] <+HexLotus> It seems like every single weapon class is viable and busted in this game.
[7:06:13] <+pupil31> oh Elden Tree
[7:06:16] <emptyantics> @stevenellis386 Cestus fucks in this game, so good
[7:06:17] <+Finnmac5> We just goin huh?

[7:06:23] <Indigo_Automaton> @Aussie_Manny I'm rocking spiked caestus that procs frostbite and bleed and it's super viable, especially in pvp
[7:06:24] <+HexLotus> “Moonveil is honestly mid”
[7:06:26] <VincentGraves> strength is kinda gimped compared to dex tho
[7:06:27] <+yeknomlive> caestus are legit good. i use them for stone enemies all the time and I'm dex faith

[7:32:37] <+HefestoForges> @Johannen there's stuff you could do right now
[7:32:43] <Johannen> felt a bit short in other 2 areas
[7:32:49] <+tuchpi> what "bosses" did woolie fight in stormveil? after margit
[7:32:51] <%Ashenik1> this isnt dark souls 4 this is Dark Souls 4,5 and 6 :)
[7:32:54] <%youngking_kush> I got to one and was thoroughly impressed
[7:32:55] <tacticallysloth> @Johannen do you like finding an elevator, and thinking nice, this will take me to the top right? AND IT GOES FURTHER DOWN
[7:33:09] <@Solidus_113> MORE CAVE SEARCHING
[7:33:22] <dds333a> The Great Cave Offensive, redux
[7:33:22] <%youngking_kush> Yeah
[7:33:25] <Johannen> @tacticallysloth guess that's the elvator Pat was talking about
[7:33:29] <%youngking_kush> South is a good idea

[7:34:11] <@Solidus_113> you can also grab the map fragments
[7:34:12] <agustorm123> You should visit south tho
[7:34:17] <iacus_> wandering to caelid this early is risky
[7:34:18] <tacticallysloth> there's an underground part deux
[7:34:22] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus South Peninsula is worth your attention offstream
[7:34:23] <%youngking_kush> Map fragments should also be a priority
[7:34:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> caelid scares me
[7:34:27] <+tuchpi> i think everyone forgets about the south LUL
[7:34:28] <iacus_> southern area is fine
[7:34:31] <%Ashenik1> Caelid its just Beksinski paitning
