[1:26:57] <+waltzqueen> we were sleeping on it
[1:27:02] <NaughtySenpai69> I was probably smoking weed and play SF4
[1:27:21] <Mirakei> What if the Post Mortem Hitstun Decay is slower than the bodies degration decay?
[1:27:33] <Mirakei> watch the head rot in real time as you combo it
[1:27:33] <GeltonZ> ...and Woolie knows a thing or two about pies!
[1:27:59] <%ggbhtg> If we get Weaponlord 2, Woolie will do a GG Lore style video for it Kappa
[1:28:17] <Mirakei> @ggbhtg WeaponLOREd
[1:28:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1389465211585896451?s=20
[1:28:18] <NaughtySenpai69> You probably had a better chance of making a successful game with the WeaponLord ip than with Skullgirls
[1:28:19] <dds333a> CarlSmile CarlSmile
[1:28:23] <DaKnightWarrior> I wish.
[1:28:26] <Mibeador> Rest in peace sweet barbarian

[1:29:57] <dds333a> This will be one of the few games I am completely in the dark on that woolie brings up
[1:30:10] <dds333a> I had no idea what that was
[1:30:15] <Mibeador> its super sick
[1:30:16] <+gg_aleph> Neo wave was cool
[1:30:16] <+Reverend_Roscoe> The Rumblefish
[1:30:19] <%gatorafan> we're going DEEP into the iceberg
[1:30:19] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The Rumblefish?

[1:30:34] <Applecannon63> THE RUMBLEFISH
[1:30:51] <%ggbhtg> and THAT'S why I mentioned nullDC, for weird stuff like that
[1:30:54] <Applecannon63> So Kof15 has some Neowave shit tech
[1:30:55] <+gg_aleph> Neowave has the best selection screen of any SNK game
[1:30:58] <dds333a> Atomiswave is neat, but I haven't played many of those either
[1:31:03] <Super_Voltekka> Mikado did a tournament of Kenju once
[1:31:16] <Applecannon63> C+Dmoves
[1:31:26] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus do you have the spreadsheet with the movelists?
[1:31:27] <GeltonZ> KenJu was never released and was only dumped a few months ago so it is a heavy mystery. DOES have a Discord though.
[1:31:37] <%ggbhtg> Tobal?
[1:31:39] <DaKnightWarrior> This is ganna be good.
[1:31:43] <dds333a> Ah, great LUL

[1:32:21] <Applecannon63> KenJu so is it designed by Toriyama!?
[1:32:21] <Mibeador> this game is surprisingly not very jank and is pretty good

[1:33:59] <Mirakei> We trying to be Tekken?
[1:34:00] <Applecannon63> Looking kinda guilty gearish
[1:34:01] <afictitiousforce> I love that the painted-on textures are asymmetrical bc you only see them primarily from one side
[1:34:04] <GeltonZ> Ew! Why are they in their crappy alts!
[1:34:04] <Super_Voltekka> FIB OPEN UP
[1:34:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's some pretty ok looking models, huh

[1:35:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:35:38] <GeltonZ> KenJu is more penetrable than Weapon Lord XD
[1:35:58] <Applecannon63> Dramatic Finishers!?
[1:36:01] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus dramatic strikes are SF3 styled super ars
[1:36:02] <moogleboy1984> Magic Series safe on block?
[1:36:03] <Mibeador> arts*
[1:36:06] <dds333a> @geltonz I believe it CarlSmile CarlSmile CarlSmile
[1:36:13] <puluxor> Not surprised, that much style is guaranteed to garner a following
[1:36:34] <Applecannon63> so is this what also inspired Capcom fighters all stars?
[1:36:44] <Applecannon63> with the dramatic gimmicks
[1:36:57] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus air drive is GG dust, it hits overhead
[1:37:11] <pixelkenj> Did someone call my name
[1:37:37] <%ggbhtg> Oh hey, this game is listed on Fightcade. Didn't know they did Atmos, heard it was a weird format.
[1:37:38] <dds333a> Ah, I am familiar with these Jebaited
[1:37:38] <leith_aziz> I never played any of the JoJo games. Im still hoping for an Arcsys JoJo fighter in the future
[1:37:38] <Mibeador> also that wiki doesn't have the full movelist, the spreadsheet is prolly better
[1:37:41] <jetjagger222> fortunately no primal rage/weapon lord style hold+motion inputs
[1:38:02] <%ggbhtg> This game and Weaponlord are both listed on Fightcade
[1:38:10] <%Juriasu> was that guys name "Slayman"
[1:38:15] <dds333a> @leith_aziz Jojoban and ASB are both great
[1:38:15] <%ggbhtg> Fightcade been movin a bit
[1:38:15] <Applecannon63> wow that protag has only one command normal
[1:38:16] <GeltonZ> @leith_aziz They've outright said they won't make one because the Capcom fighter is too good.
[1:38:17] <leith_aziz> AOF Boss
[1:38:20] <jetjagger222> not-blacker baron
[1:38:31] <DaKnightWarrior> The art has always been so sick.
[1:38:45] <Mibeador> Gale is all half circle stances btw
[1:38:45] <jetjagger222> lol kamen rider pose
[1:38:57] <dds333a> I was literally just about to say Black Baron, and Blacker Baron Jebaited
[1:38:57] <+Mrbaconator> eiji looks like a character steve blum would voice
[1:38:58] <Applecannon63> HENSHIN
[1:39:02] <%ggbhtg> Fightcade may be movin, but it doesn't mean every game is suddenly Rollback
[1:39:20] <%ggbhtg> KAMEN RAIDO
[1:39:22] <dds333a> It's Blackest Baron
[1:39:24] <%ggbhtg> D-D-D-DECADO
[1:39:25] <Applecannon63> oh so like third strick super select

[1:39:47] <jetjagger222> straight up dudley f+HP
[1:39:49] <+dr_steve1790> These designs are pretty sick
[1:39:57] <Applecannon63> SHINKU MUFFLER
[1:40:00] <%Juriasu> okay this actually looks sick
[1:40:01] <@Solidus_113> main found
[1:40:06] <DaKnightWarrior> The character models feel very TvC.
[1:40:12] <floralkami> wait, is this not 3d movement?
[1:40:20] <Deko_> oh i thought it was a 3d fighter this looks sick
[1:40:22] <jetjagger222> nope its like rival schools
[1:40:28] <%gatorafan> P R E S S U R E D A N G E R
[1:40:29] <jetjagger222> on no
[1:40:30] <+gg_aleph> what's that meter on top?
[1:40:37] <jetjagger222> rival schools had a dodge
[1:40:39] <floralkami> I also thought Rival Schools was a 3d movement fighter
[1:40:40] <dds333a> A little tug of war system
[1:40:40] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> We got systems
[1:40:41] <pacibuddy> unist moment
[1:40:44] <leith_aziz> @GeltonZ:  Ehh. I still dont buy that. I also remember that being a pretty old statement, so who knows? Reminder that they made DBFZ in a world where the Budokai games exist, and they're apparently very beloved.
[1:40:51] <%ggbhtg> is that a TOP Gauge
[1:40:52] <dds333a> COME OVER  HERE
[1:40:56] <Potatoidea> COME OVER HERE
[1:40:59] <BliVru> MANO STRIKRU! wait that means hand hit?
[1:41:03] <%Juriasu> he's just a rider LUL
[1:41:07] <+samuraiknack> What game are we playing now? I went to get a drink
[1:41:13] <dds333a> Kenju
[1:41:16] <Applecannon63> HENSHIN
[1:41:18] <GeltonZ> @leith_aziz There's a HUGE difference between the okay quality of Budokai and the Capcom Jojo fighters but indeed we shall see.
[1:41:27] <%ggbhtg> FINAL ATTACK RIDE
[1:41:33] <floralkami> damn, you mean to tell me there was cel-shaded 3D models like this already, yet NO ONE in AAA is using this technique??
[1:41:34] <+ManOfReason> looks pretty rad
[1:41:35] <jetjagger222> @samuraiknack kenju
[1:41:35] <leith_aziz> The cell shading is really good, I gotta say
[1:41:44] <Applecannon63> Dude literally has a Typhoon Belt
[1:41:47] <Potatoidea> Guilty Gear?
[1:41:48] <@Solidus_113> slayman
[1:41:53] <leith_aziz> Hol Horse!
[1:41:55] <moogleboy1984> he has a monkey on his back
[1:41:56] <+TheyTookMyBeard> Slayman atpCap
[1:41:58] <jetjagger222> nanoha has one wide-ass face
[1:42:00] <Mibeador> The pressure meter is the big meter below the health bars. It increases when you do actions that benefit yourselve, like hitting the opponent and landing parries. When it's full, hitting a special will trigger Kenju Kakusei which is pretty much a free full 50% combo
[1:42:01] <+allups> lol his name is slayman, so fiting
[1:42:06] <GeltonZ> Dihol Brandhorse!
[1:42:10] <+samuraiknack> Thanks
[1:42:11] <BliVru> yep
[1:42:13] <%ggbhtg> IT BE DO
[1:42:14] <HelluvaNohbody> Gyro Brando?
[1:42:16] <dds333a> Yeah, the rooftop
[1:42:16] <%fetrigon> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK

[1:42:21] <jetjagger222> he's got vash's face
[1:42:32] <+dr_steve1790> ARIZONA
[1:42:33] <Applecannon63> GOD BLESS THE RINGS
[1:42:35] <%Juriasu> EEEH?
[1:42:41] <+dr_steve1790> MY FAVORITE ERGHEIZ STAGE
[1:42:41] <puluxor> A-NIME asakuraWow
[1:42:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:42:42] <+SilverDevilfish> oh it's Andy and Mai Kappa
[1:42:43] <floralkami> @potatoidea true, tho that one is too good at replicating the anime look
[1:42:44] <+ManOfReason> what
[1:42:45] <%gatorafan> Huh? Special intro?
[1:42:51] <leith_aziz> Gyro Zeppeli
[1:42:53] <Mibeador> Slayman's [2]8K is omega cheap
[1:42:56] <%ggbhtg> BRING BACK CHARACTER INTROS, sheeesh
[1:42:59] <dds333a> Nah, these characters aren't very GG
[1:43:04] <pacibuddy> "We have johnny at home"
[1:43:14] <%gatorafan> SLAYMAN is such a stupid name I love it!
[1:43:15] <BliVru> Holy shit hes just a Gyro Zeppeli trace
[1:43:20] <floralkami> this looks like the best evolution from Megaman Legends style cel-shading
[1:43:21] <Applecannon63> oh q Kunoich
[1:43:22] <dds333a> Plenty of games still have unique intros, they just aren't fully acted
[1:43:23] <puluxor> @pacibuddy LUL LUL
[1:43:24] <moogleboy1984> Morrigan dashes?
[1:43:29] <usurper_sos> Yoo air control
[1:43:38] <Potatoidea> Whoa
[1:43:39] <+waltzqueen> HAJIMARU ARIGATO
[1:43:39] <jetjagger222> nanoha has some elena shit
[1:43:41] <@Solidus_113> dust
[1:43:45] <dds333a> Right, that's the dust
[1:43:47] <DaKnightWarrior> @floralkami it really does.
[1:44:00] <dds333a> Just, in reverse
[1:44:02] <+samuraiknack> Did Ninja Theory get Slayman and Dante mixed up
[1:44:06] <Applecannon63> Holy shit was that a Dust Attack
[1:44:07] <Iwashi94> Animal Island!
[1:44:11] <%Zero_Jacks> zyzxOHSNAP I remember seeing this
[1:44:15] <Iwashi94> Miracle Adventure!
[1:44:15] <leith_aziz> I kinda wish unique fight intros were still a thing. There were the DBFZ intros, but they kinda gave up on that after launch. Well, the unique dialog is still great
[1:44:25] <%Juriasu> LUL
[1:44:25] <Potatoidea> LUL
[1:44:28] <dds333a> Do the combo
[1:44:36] <BlackermanZX> thjs game looks cool
[1:44:36] <Potatoidea> His back is broken now
[1:44:40] <pi_in_the_sci> The Bald Eagle crest on the stage floor is dope
[1:44:41] <%jepupu> Pressure went to max yeah
[1:44:43] <Super_Voltekka> To think this game was both fully made and fully translated and it somehow got the axe?!?
[1:44:49] <BlackermanZX> is that friggin hol horse StinkyGlitch
[1:44:59] <floralkami> I really hope this is on Fightcade
[1:45:08] <Applecannon63> So Kenju Awakening just Darkforce?
[1:45:10] <DaKnightWarrior> I miss fighters being this wacky.
[1:45:17] <pi_in_the_sci> I also like that it plays coconut trotting when Slayerman moves
[1:45:29] <GeltonZ> @floralkami Apparently it IS but it might be wonky. It's a Dreamcast game mostly.
[1:45:37] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus The pressure meter is the big meter below the health bars. It increases when you do actions that benefit yourselve, like hitting the opponent and landing parries. When it's full, hitting a special will trigger Kenju Kakusei which is pretty much a free full 50% combo
[1:45:37] <dds333a> He's not really like any Jojo character, he's very much in the vein of Needless
[1:45:39] <Potatoidea> Get this brat some pants
[1:45:40] <moogleboy1984> Like putting SF2 Guile into MVC2
[1:45:43] <+waltzqueen> she has no undewear on
[1:45:51] <+dr_steve1790> I would totally main Nanoha. She's a ninja after my heart. <3
[1:45:53] <Potatoidea> Uh
[1:46:08] <Applecannon63> The Rake?
[1:46:11] <HuggbeesTV> This game looks fucking sick
[1:46:11] <SNK_Dan> What in the world are these characters LUL
[1:46:13] <dds333a> De Rake, like Drake, I assume
[1:46:14] <jetjagger222> its anime freeman
[1:46:15] <floralkami> @waltzqueen did you not see the red?
[1:46:17] <Potatoidea> Nice Dio pose
[1:46:22] <dds333a> Like saying Duraku
[1:46:22] <GeltonZ> The lolis tag out, one is charge the other is command.
[1:46:24] <+waltzqueen> @floralkami i guess i didn't
[1:46:25] <Iwashi94> De Rake? Balakey?
[1:46:26] <floralkami> it was a bodysuit
[1:46:34] <%ggbhtg> negative penalty huh
[1:46:35] <jetjagger222> wow dio
[1:46:43] <Potatoidea> Even has the birthmark
[1:46:45] <leith_aziz> @Super_Voltekka Its not the only game to get such treament, unfortunately. There was that pretty funny Wii game that only released on EU. Nintendo never released it outside becuase of sales
[1:46:45] <%Juriasu> he's just dio
[1:46:48] <puluxor> SO anime! asakuraWow
[1:46:51] <usurper_sos> That stance
[1:46:51] <Applecannon63> HENTAI
[1:46:52] <jetjagger222> killer queen

[1:47:07] <floralkami> Dio looking ass wannebe
[1:47:08] <+waltzqueen> Micheal Jackson scream
[1:47:09] <+samuraiknack> Stand users of the week:The Fighting game
[1:47:12] <dds333a> This is more of a Jojo character than Slayman

[1:59:21] <GeltonZ> Oh geeze she has ears and a tail. ACTUAL cat suit.
[1:59:28] <Super_Voltekka> Maybe Gale's the real reason why this game got canceled LUL
[1:59:37] <%gatorafan> Which Gacha did this lady come from? daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:59:40] <crimsonsaens> So she's Cammy?
[1:59:43] <%jepupu> This game has some heavy hit sounds.
[1:59:45] <DSD24> Tornado Stike!
[1:59:58] <dds333a> Ooh, hints of music I like
[2:00:03] <moogleboy1984> Apparently there's two characters that can be unlocked, but no one knows how to yet
[2:00:05] <DSD24> Woolie always finds the Boxer
[2:00:06] <dds333a> I'm hearing it
[2:00:13] <JetpackMcQuack> throw her onto the roof
[2:00:23] <PMda2nd> she's still flying

[2:00:58] <+skylerpilot> that boxer is HUGE
[2:01:05] <Mirakei> Does the pressure meter do anything or is it just a visual indicator?
[2:01:17] <%jepupu> Getting counter hit seems to drop the bar?
[2:01:23] <GeltonZ> @Mirakei It does SOMETHING crazy but I forget what.
[2:01:24] <Mirakei> because if it enabled or disabled moves/supers etc depending on where it is that'd be really interesting
[2:01:26] <Iwashi94> LUL
[2:01:29] <$pixelkenj> such range
[2:01:36] <halfmasks> @Mirakei I think meter is affected by pressure
[2:01:37] <dds333a> According to what people more knowledgeable than I have said, it actually does something
[2:01:38] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus wanna play online? Flycast dojo has netplay and I could show you some stuff since I've played the game a lot
[2:01:43] <@Solidus_113> WHY DIDN'T THIS COME OUT
[2:01:44] <WakeUpThrow> Boy, a big body with Steve-esque sways is fucking terrifying
[2:01:49] <%jepupu> I thing getting hit with a counter hit lowers the meter

[2:02:48] <Mirakei> the pressure meter goes up as you hit the opponent, block or not. So it clearly wants you to be aggressive. But what it actually gives you when you make it go up

[2:03:05] <dds333a> @mibeador got any lore you could drop on us? or maybe @geltonz or @pixelkenj
[2:03:09] <DSD24> Roger looks like Ky
[2:03:09] <%gatorafan> catJAM
[2:03:16] <Mibeador> uh, there isn't muhc lore
[2:03:16] <%jepupu> Clown cagefights
[2:03:20] <Mibeador> cause most of the story is missing lol
[2:03:20] <JetpackMcQuack> what a bet
[2:03:22] <WakeUpThrow> Wow these don't look like early 2000's models at all, they're fantastic
[2:03:24] <dds333a> If possible, anyway, I could do without
[2:03:25] <afictitiousforce> Emil riding through during the final dramatic battle
[2:03:32] <+Gamblitz> I'm expecting some dead Flying Graysons
[2:03:35] <dds333a> @mibeador gotcha
[2:03:36] <%gatorafan> @Mibeador THE DARK SOULS OF FIGHTING GAMES Kappa
[2:03:46] <%jepupu> Counterhit probably
[2:03:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:03:50] <Applecannon63> Roger is Ky and Rock with moves from Ken
[2:03:58] <$pixelkenj> Is Roger wearing a speedo over his pants
[2:04:07] <Mibeador> but basically, there's an evil scientist organization that's trying to make a perfect world, that organization includes Tairon and the final boss character the twins De-rake and Gale. The good guys are trying to stop them for their personal reasons
[2:04:12] <Mirakei> imagine if you only had reversals if the pressure meter was in the "danger range" as in the person currently having the momentum disadvantage gets access to reversals
[2:04:13] <moogleboy1984> Juggle Dimension seems really jarring
[2:04:36] <Mibeador> also Tairon isn't Roger's dad
[2:04:37] <dds333a> @mibeador not surspirising that De Rake is an antagonist, neat
[2:04:42] <Mirakei> There's some interesting potential concepts there regardless of how this game itself actually works.
[2:04:47] <Applecannon63> Thats what Guilty Gear's Dust Attacks were like
[2:04:52] <Mibeador> De-rake betrays the main antagonist for some reason so yeah
[2:04:59] <jetjagger222> wow is that mexican ultimate warrior

[2:19:25] <moogleboy1984> Yeah, the texture on that wall is nauseating
[2:19:27] <Mibeador> Mephisto is an evil organization

[2:23:11] <fangovafang> boxing marduk lol
[2:23:13] <moogleboy1984> I think having them use Miqote Female Voice 5 was the worst part of their design
[2:23:19] <floralkami> for a guy named Heavy D, I'd assume he'd be heavy.
[2:23:30] <DSD24> Did they play that Edgy guy with the White Hair?
[2:23:34] <Applecannon63> MONKE
[2:23:56] <%drefizz> WOW

[2:24:36] <Mibeador> they used them once

[2:26:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> woolie has returned to monke
[2:26:09] <%drefizz> he does it at the club
[2:26:24] <DSD24> That was sick
[2:26:27] <dds333a> Ooh
[2:26:35] <+PkSilent01> Hanuman is very Unga Bunga from just looking how he fights
[2:26:40] <dds333a> Right back in it
[2:26:45] <%drefizz> he yell reminds me of Elena's yell in 3rd strike
[2:26:47] <%drefizz> her*
[2:26:49] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus in air drive if you press the same attack button your opponent did it reduces the damage
[2:26:51] <+Dak3000> wow

[2:27:26] <%drefizz> Was that LEO?
[2:27:28] <+PkSilent01> did they play the twins?
[2:27:33] <Mibeador> they played them once
[2:27:40] <Applecannon63> Yes Hotblooded Rider
[2:27:40] <dds333a> I didn't know what to expect from just the screenshots
[2:27:48] <+breakersnap> @floralkami i call the single leg dead lifts
[2:27:49] <DSD24> Oh shit he's French

[2:28:46] <%ggbhtg> Batsu + Kamen Rider
[2:28:57] <Applecannon63> Batsu as a Hot blooded Kamen Rider 2
[2:28:58] <floralkami> @drefizz there are ass and thigh lovers, and then there's me.
[2:29:07] <%drefizz> I love both
[2:29:19] <Mibeador> the spinny move you saw woolie do is great for air juggles but it's -43 cause the second half of it whiffs on ground
[2:29:19] <%drefizz> and personality :)
[2:29:24] <dds333a> Kakusei time
[2:29:33] <floralkami> you and I can get along @drefizz
[2:29:33] <%ggbhtg> actual Rider Kick
[2:29:33] <Applecannon63> RIDER KICK
[2:29:38] <DaKnightWarrior> Kenju is wild.
[2:29:58] <jetjagger222> @Mibeador it looks like death on hit or whiff
[2:30:06] <Mibeador> it's a free punish yeaj
[2:30:10] <floralkami> damn, I can't believe all these guys have different fits
[2:30:15] <dds333a> Damn
[2:30:17] <Applecannon63> I mean Batsu's Ryusei Kick is a Rider Kick
[2:30:24] <floralkami> so much love in this game...
[2:30:30] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus wanna play online? Flycast dojo has netplay and I could show you some stuff since I've played the game a lot
[2:30:32] <DSD24> De Rake is cool
[2:30:49] <Mibeador> @WoolieVersus any special move activates KK when pressure is fool
[2:30:52] <Mibeador> dang
[2:30:59] <Mibeador> full*
[2:31:03] <+Xeno351> the game is just straight up done, so why did it never get released?
[2:31:04] <jetjagger222> hey sleyman also has a little monkey buddy
[2:31:07] <jetjagger222> on his shoulder
[2:31:20] <+IronChefWookie> is that an aipom?
[2:31:28] <floralkami> who owns this IP? Capcom?
[2:31:29] <Mibeador> @Xeno351 there's actually an unfinished character left in the code who you can play as by hacking
[2:31:45] <%drefizz> LOL
[2:31:50] <Applecannon63> @xeno351 not really finished cause one character has 2 moves
[2:31:57] <dds333a> Meter seems to come and go, but I don't know if people who actually know can chime in
[2:32:15] <Pookiedaexzile> ATTA
[2:32:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:32:24] <jetjagger222> aYO
[2:32:28] <DaKnightWarrior> That was sick.
[2:32:30] <Pookiedaexzile> OH GIANT SWING
[2:32:31] <%ggbhtg> S L U M P E D
[2:32:40] <Applecannon63> DAT DROP KICK
[2:32:44] <dds333a> God Backbreaker  to Dropkick
[2:32:45] <Mibeador> @dds333a supers are really good cause they're just a free 50% or give some characters a command throw, and for most characters they don't spend EX much since they can do damage without. Guard cancels need meter tho so that's useful
[2:32:50] <floralkami> anyone knows who owns this IP?

[2:33:54] <floralkami> @mibeador I'm guessing they either still open it or was brought out and the IP was left to dust?
[2:34:00] <floralkami> *own
[2:34:11] <Mibeador> they probably just still own it and it's gathering dust
[2:34:20] <floralkami> cause this needs some love, man

[2:34:42] <+pupil31> TORNADO
[2:34:44] <%drefizz> woolieMINHMAX @derap41
[2:34:47] <floralkami> at least in the form of taking the characters for another game.
[2:35:07] <feralspidey> to be fair, misspelled grammar was the rule of cool back in the late 90s early 00s
[2:35:07] <Applecannon63> jeez the guitar
[2:35:12] <%drefizz> TORNADE
[2:35:14] <+pupil31> I like ya cut G
[2:35:17] <$SilverRoddo> He’s doing what best for biznuhz
[2:35:17] <Pookiedaexzile> What you don't know is he's only the size  of Mayweather but since the games in Japan, He's huge
[2:35:31] <+pupil31> She gave him that "I like ya cut g" slaps
[2:35:36] <derap41> Are those boots or like comfy socks
[2:35:37] <floralkami> tbf, Tornade sounds like a cool move name as-is
