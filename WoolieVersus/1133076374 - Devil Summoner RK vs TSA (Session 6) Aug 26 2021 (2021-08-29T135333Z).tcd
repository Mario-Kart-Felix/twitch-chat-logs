[0:24:58] <%meniscate> "evil" the guy just loves his country okay. he did nothing wrong
[0:25:00] <+NukeDaHippies> One of the best raidou 2 changes is no encounters on the side of the same street

[0:27:07] <+NukeDaHippies> @andre11dr Hey, you might hate that Persona is the poster child series, but after Persona 4 i discovered the other SMT games. So it's a great entry point
[0:27:09] <%dds333a> some models are entirely new, but many are just updated

[0:37:37] <%livlinn> Do not worry Victor gets hotter after time passes by
[0:37:57] <+Balkespower> @nukedahippies in Soul Hackers it is a captain to the boat Goumaden
[0:38:03] <%damiensiegfried> i just hop on and i see a tentacle monster and a tiger from Yakuza 2

[0:41:18] <%dds333a> @blackermanzx at least they mean that positively according to what christian believe LUL
[0:41:21] <+Balkespower> smt4 was a lot closer to how the angels was depicted in the bible
[0:41:40] <+CopperTucker> there's a reason why all angels tell people "BE NOT AFRAID" when they first appear
[0:41:48] <Murdercles> Raging Blast is extremely good
[0:42:07] <Murdercles> wipes the board basically
[0:42:08] <%dds333a> @coppertucker usually due to the fucktons of noise and light they create when they appear LUL
[0:42:12] <andre11dr> Imagine seeing a creepy ass Lovecraft looking thing and going "oh yes, this is definitely my protector" LUL
[0:42:16] <%DashXero> Eldritch Horrors could have been angels...?
[0:42:21] <%damiensiegfried> "be not afraid" "dude you're a bunch of flaming rings!"
[0:42:22] <+Balkespower> yes
[0:42:50] <QueequegTheater> Fun fact, women with wings ARE angels in the Bible as well so it's totally fine to portray them that way
[0:43:07] <+tempestzephyr> needs hassu tobi
[0:43:16] <Murdercles> nooooooooo
[0:43:20] <Murdercles> raging blastttttt
[0:43:31] <Murdercles> sigh

[1:49:53] <%dds333a> smart
[1:50:50] <Am_Shigar00> That's why I kept a Moh Shuvuu for my entire run. She was a really nice in between healer.
[1:50:52] <andre11dr> You should really just get a skill monkey
[1:51:05] <DSD24> Also Moh Shuvuu is cute
[1:51:06] <SpookyMooks> id say one
[1:51:13] <turboyabo> ikusa is hitting it from the back with that spear
[1:51:16] <OblivionSword1> It's a three headed man on a horse
[1:51:17] <Am_Shigar00> @DSD24 That too! Very cute.
[1:51:22] <%dds333a> what about Berith? Eligor? LUL
[1:51:24] <OblivionSword1> yeah Hitokotonusi
[1:51:27] <+Grayhammatter> wow, cool
[1:51:31] <OblivionSword1> leaf man
[1:51:35] <andre11dr> Good question
[1:51:45] <DSD24> I wonder if Fire works
[1:51:46] <xeros720> love this guy
[1:51:54] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[1:52:03] <andre11dr> Probably use fire ,but i don't know Kappa
[1:52:04] <%dds333a> his art is cool as shit too
[1:52:22] <turboyabo> force is wind
[1:52:37] <%dds333a> @turboyabo right? LUL
[1:52:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:53:02] <andre11dr> His made of wood and leafs
[1:53:15] <OblivionSword1> ooooohhh
[1:53:17] <OblivionSword1> cool
[1:53:28] <Am_Shigar00> I remember not expecting this at all the first time I fought him.
[1:54:05] <Murdercles> bosses with weaknesses dont trigger every time
[1:54:20] <%meniscate> Force is wind...
[1:54:30] <turboyabo> thet dont trigger when there using there attacks
[1:55:00] <Am_Shigar00> Man, even without hitting the weakness, Yoshitune hits hard.
[1:55:01] <DSD24> Yoshitsune loves the fight
[1:55:06] <andre11dr> That melee attack man
[1:55:24] <DSD24> That trait is in a lot depictions of him
[1:55:49] <Dave_VD> How close are they to the end?
[1:55:54] <%dds333a> and the previous was an Anzu LUL
[1:56:05] <+Grayhammatter> now that is some damage
[1:56:07] <turboyabo> there at the mid point
[1:56:09] <%dds333a> @dave_vd he's at the halfway point
[1:56:11] <Am_Shigar00> I'd love to see him morph forms like this in a modern game. It's probably look super freaking cool.
[1:56:28] <Dave_VD> Dope, thanks for the replies :)
[1:56:38] <hunter21111> I would guess ice for the third
[1:56:55] <DSD24> He's so cute now
[1:56:58] <+Grayhammatter> a poltergeist LUL
[1:57:13] <Am_Shigar00> he  so tiny!
[1:57:24] <DSD24> Was that Mudo?
[1:57:29] <xeros720> yeah, that was mudo
[1:57:31] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that damage
[1:57:33] <turboyabo> yes
[1:57:36] <Murdercles> mamudo
[1:57:37] <DSD24> Ooof
[1:57:39] <andre11dr> I like how he can still shoot beams
[1:57:39] <%dds333a> Mamudo, specifically
[1:57:40] <Am_Shigar00> Yup, Mudo is do half-health damage in this game.
[1:57:49] <%dds333a> @murdercles beat me to it LUL
[1:57:51] <andre11dr> That was mudo
[1:57:55] <turboyabo> it can instant kill
[1:58:11] <andre11dr> Luckily it just does exactly half of your life
[1:58:12] <Murdercles> @dds333a i play this game a lot LUL
[1:58:26] <xeros720> yoshitsune is awesome though, so it's all good
[1:58:31] <%dds333a> @murdercles that makes two of us LUL
[1:58:40] <hunter21111> He is no longer blue
[1:58:41] <turboyabo> alright
[1:58:47] <+Grayhammatter> no longer blue
[1:58:58] <turboyabo> next up long dong comin strong
[1:59:11] <Am_Shigar00> I hate that they made Yoshitsune a fusion accident only demon in SMT IV. Makes him nearly impossible to get.
[1:59:22] <Murdercles> @dds333a it is hurting my soul that he keeps doing the 1-2-3 combo finisher instead of charging the second hit to end with spin slash
[1:59:23] <DSD24> Oh yeah new Title
[1:59:57] <turboyabo> accidently fusion can be got throught luck
[1:59:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1430408520910917632?s=19
[2:00:06] <DSD24> His Dark Project
[2:00:07] <andre11dr> Again the fact that Raidous bosses are those crows that i one shooted in most SMTs is kinda funny
[2:00:16] <%dds333a> @murdercles hell, the spin can be buffered even at the end if the third, yeah LUL
[2:00:40] <andre11dr> Like they aren't even that good in most games
[2:00:41] <%dds333a> Nah, political interests LUL LUL
[2:01:14] <%townzzzzz> all for japan
[2:01:16] <%dds333a> ship those zombies all over the world
[2:01:19] <xeros720> souless you  might say
[2:01:21] <xeros720> a whole army of them
[2:01:57] <%meniscate> About as disgusting as those war crimes
[2:01:58] <Phob05> And that's how zombies became Japans #1 export
[2:02:02] <DSD24> That intro when Raidou got punked
[2:02:08] <%dds333a> In Japanese, "Soulless Army" is literally "Super Power Corps" LUL
[2:02:09] <SkinnyRite> LUL LUL LUL
[2:02:15] <Am_Shigar00> That's hilarious
[2:02:32] <%Prevot> it's the fucking 5G
[2:02:35] <SkinnyRite> CARL
[2:02:37] <DSD24> Raidou Kuzunoha vs The Super Power Corps
[2:02:51] <xeros720> oh, that fits their design better earlier on
[2:02:54] <DSD24> Yeah Soulless Army sounds better
[2:03:02] <Qu1ckyyy> Raidou Kuzunoha vs The 5G Army
[2:03:09] <xeros720> with their masks they kind of look like sentai villains
[2:03:44] <%dds333a> insurance Kappa
[2:03:45] <Murdercles> eh, Narumi probably mouthed off to them
[2:03:51] <DSD24> This guys outfit looks similar to that cool looking guy in the SMT5 new trailer
[2:03:52] <%DashXero> "You didn't trust me enough to talk to me and not beat up my boy."
[2:03:53] <turboyabo> its his job to help there was no reason to beat up on narumi
[2:04:00] <Am_Shigar00> It is funny that we just the throw the whole "we beat up Narumi" thing under the rug so quickly.
[2:04:12] <%dds333a> the Hiruko
[2:04:20] <Qu1ckyyy> Out of the back of his neck
[2:04:46] <turboyabo> woolie baiscally on it today
[2:04:47] <%dds333a> @turboyabo Sadakichi and the rest of the Navy needed to make sure LULsure
[2:05:17] <andre11dr> Damn Narumi heeled up quick

[2:05:28] <turboyabo> thats like beating on his fake boss to make sure he dose the job
[2:05:31] <DSD24> Cleaning his guns too
[2:05:43] <DSD24> That's a SAO game
[2:05:59] <+MakoTensei> what makes normal bullet less fatal?
[2:06:02] <Murdercles> these are uranium tipped, Raidou
[2:06:17] <Am_Shigar00> They're less bullety?
[2:06:18] <+Hollow_Mirage> Here have some Hollow Point Raidou!
[2:06:30] <DSD24> Tower of Stee
[2:06:34] <DSD24> Tower of Steel
[2:06:36] <turboyabo> oh he commin
[2:06:37] <%dds333a> @turboyabo pretty much, the Hiruko feeds on a person's insecurities and doubts, turning them into a Red Cape, and they take out their frustration on the things that they hated
[2:06:38] <kingra> monkaS
[2:06:40] <Joestar1890> The boss in this chapter is a pain in the ass
[2:06:43] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> monkaS
[2:06:46] <%dds333a> DUDE
[2:06:51] <+MakoTensei> oh man... the tower
[2:06:51] <Am_Shigar00> dun dun...dundundun...
[2:06:53] <andre11dr> Towers in SMTs are usually cursed
[2:06:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:06:59] <BlackOrchidKI> Shin Megami Towers
[2:07:01] <DSD24> The Tower means Disaster
[2:07:03] <andre11dr> And Woolie doesn't even know
[2:07:04] <SkinnyRite> Yakuza Millennium Tower vibes
[2:07:06] <%dds333a> Karma temple, Daedalus, Tower of Amala, Sky Tower
[2:07:11] <Bustahhwulf> whats the odds of it being the tower of babel? 100% Kappa
[2:07:16] <+KaguraRaion> Tower of Kagutsuchi WutFace
[2:07:31] <turboyabo> you like fish sticks
[2:07:36] <andre11dr> Does the Calpa count as a tower?
[2:07:48] <%Prevot> believe in your own truth Raidou
[2:07:51] <andre11dr> It's basically a reverse tower
[2:07:55] <Am_Shigar00> Believe in your own justice.
[2:08:02] <+Hollow_Mirage> Ah yes a good natured person suggesting the country makes super soldiers! Yeah totally a nice and peaceful guy!
[2:08:05] <%DashXero> "Don't be a willing fool."
[2:08:13] <DSD24> Yeah!
[2:08:15] <Qu1ckyyy> Is it Eridanus?
[2:08:15] <Joestar1890> OH NO
[2:08:17] <kingra> Oh man
[2:08:17] <Am_Shigar00> Oooooh boy
[2:08:18] <DSD24> Eriandinus right?
[2:08:20] <%Zero_Jacks> Jesus
[2:08:21] <Joestar1890> NOT THE STRANGE JOURNEY MAP
[2:08:21] <+MakoTensei> OHHHHH
[2:08:25] <kingra> LUL
[2:08:27] <zanzibarian_hamster> EREDANIUS
[2:08:27] <Qu1ckyyy> OMG not that
[2:08:28] <%townzzzzz> GREAT MAP
[2:08:29] <DSD24> SMT Doom Slayer
[2:08:29] <andre11dr> Yeah that this is cursed
[2:08:29] <+Zeromaru2> No please
[2:08:30] <%LurkerKraid> woolieTRASH
[2:08:31] <BlackermanZX> its insane
[2:08:32] <kingra> THAT FACE LUL
[2:08:32] <%dds333a> Sector E woolieGASM
[2:08:33] <linSP> Strange journey is rad
[2:08:37] <Qu1ckyyy> WOOLIE that is ONE FLOOR of the map
[2:08:42] <+Hollow_Mirage> Sector EEEEEEEEEEEE
[2:08:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's actually super easy when you get into it, you cut it up into sections
[2:08:45] <+MakoTensei> OH GOD NOT STRANGE JOURNEY NOOOOOO
[2:08:51] <+KaguraRaion> LUL
[2:08:53] <Blank9> look up smt4 apocalypse final dungeon
[2:08:53] <%meniscate> E is fun though. Nothing compared to Etrian
[2:08:54] <DSD24> Strange Journey is so cool
[2:09:00] <Murdercles> man I love Strange Journey LUL
[2:09:01] <andre11dr> Strange Journey is rad as hell but ,THAT PLCE IS CURSED
[2:09:06] <DSD24> I love the MC in that game
[2:09:06] <Phob05> It's the Harem Queen dungeon of SJ
[2:09:16] <%meniscate> The Great Filter
[2:09:20] <+MakoTensei> one floor of the dungeon
[2:09:20] <%dds333a> @zanzibarian_hamster Grus is actually worse, yeah LUL
[2:09:22] <Am_Shigar00> Persona Q1's final dungeon also has some fun maps to look at. Ooh boy.
[2:09:28] <Qu1ckyyy> I leveled up 30 times in Eridanus, ended up defeating one of the hardest boss almost on auto mode
[2:09:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> If you want hell look up old wizardry maps, they have some non-neuclidean geometry going on sometimes
[2:09:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> and you draw the map YOURSELF
[2:09:54] <andre11dr> Strange Journey is not even the worst with it
[2:10:02] <Am_Shigar00> Really, any SMT with a grid map is going to look like a mess.
[2:10:06] <%dds333a> Since Megami Tensei
[2:10:06] <cozyduck> wizardry 4 maps LUL
[2:10:08] <+MakoTensei> most people I know dropped strange journey at the ouroboros boss
[2:10:09] <+Hollow_Mirage> Dude Wizardry I want to get into but good god! Your characters fucking SUCK! If you don’t use mods to edit stats
[2:10:13] <%meniscate> Did YOU finish it?
[2:10:15] <%townzzzzz> what are you casual
[2:10:24] <Phob05> SJ has a map that shows you where the traps and the stairs are
[2:10:26] <andre11dr> Strange Journey is relatively accessible compared to the other FPS ones
[2:10:30] <%dds333a> it is LUL
[2:10:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> blobbers/dungeon crawlers
[2:10:53] <@Solidus_113> You are a cartographer
[2:10:56] <+MakoTensei> idk man. I found smt 1 and 2 pretty pleasant but strange journey just felt like cbt
[2:11:05] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:11:11] <%meniscate> The SMTV director worked on most of the Etrian Odyssey games
[2:11:16] <%Prevot> etrian odyssey is awesome
[2:11:17] <+KaguraRaion> Wish i like the EO games the combats awesome but i dont want to make a map ever
[2:11:22] <Am_Shigar00> I love building the maps in EO. I draw out stuff like FOE routes to figure out the best way to run through them.
[2:11:29] <Murdercles> the first Wizardry game on PS2 is good and pretty accessible
[2:11:32] <SpookyMooks> dunno
[2:11:42] <Murdercles> you do not start as complete trash in that one
[2:11:43] <andre11dr> What if you need them later Kappa
[2:11:53] <andre11dr> But you have 99
[2:11:57] <+MakoTensei> man its been a little while since the etrian team announced anything. wonder when the next one will happen
[2:11:59] <Phob05> Old megaten games tended to have 1 or 2 dungeons that where really bad but it's usually manageable
[2:12:03] <%dds333a> anyway, eventually that runs it's course, and the Hiruko seperates from the person after feeding
[2:12:04] <+KaguraRaion> @Murdercles Forsaken Land is sick the art and music's so good
[2:12:04] <andre11dr> WHAT IF I NEED THEM LATER
[2:12:07] <KaitlynnHere> @andre11dr hey, don’t implant mind goblins
[2:12:19] <Am_Shigar00> Honestly, I wish Tokyo Mirage Sessions on Wii U let you edit the maps on the gamepad. Some of those puzzles were a bit annoying with notes.
[2:12:30] <Am_Shigar00> *without notes
[2:12:31] <DSD24> Oooo I've been playing WIzardry 8 that game is fun
[2:13:05] <DSD24> That PS2 Wizardry game looks fun too was that Wizardry Tale of the Forsaken Land?
[2:13:22] <+MakoTensei> Well SMT if... has a dungeon where you have to walk up and down a corridor for time to pass for the tunnel to get finished... this takes like 3 hours
[2:13:28] <andre11dr> Is that thing even good?
[2:13:34] <andre11dr> I never use him
[2:13:43] <+KaguraRaion> @DSD24 Yes great music and art
[2:13:45] <%dds333a> @andre11dr it's not even a good boss LUL
[2:13:48] <OblivionSword1> speeeeen
[2:13:49] <Phob05> The only thing I ever really hear about if... is World of Sloth
[2:14:06] <+MakoTensei> if... is generally good besides that dungeon
[2:14:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:14:14] <DSD24> Ooo I see Parvati
[2:14:29] <Am_Shigar00> There's a fan doing a remake of if... for PC. It's still early, but it looks promising.
[2:14:40] <+MakoTensei> it got cancelled bud
[2:14:42] <Phob05> There's usually 1 dungeon that people point to in each game
[2:14:47] <Am_Shigar00> SEriously? gdamn it.
[2:14:58] <%Prevot> every time woolie says Tarrasque I think of Tear Ass House
[2:15:01] <+bear_breaker20> anyone here sick nasty enough to commit 3+ years of their life into the SMT gacha?
[2:15:02] <DSD24> Rakshasa is really dull sword man
[2:15:04] <DSD24> cool
[2:15:06] <Phob05> really, damn Atlus got no chill
[2:15:10] <hunter21111> Coming from Persona it is weird seeing Yoshitsune being such a low level
[2:15:11] <andre11dr> I think soon enough we'll see my favorite female demon
[2:15:14] <Phob05> I suppose that tracks
[2:15:15] <+MakoTensei> yeah the guy was too scared to keep going cuz he didnt want a dmca from atlus
[2:15:17] <%dds333a> @bear_breaker20 fuck no
[2:15:30] <Am_Shigar00> @bear_breaker20 I played a little bit when it started, but I already had too many gachas to commit.
[2:15:44] <DSD24> The SMT Gacha has those funny Demon reviews
[2:15:48] <%dds333a> @andre11dr is Cybele in this game. I think that's who you're referring to LUL
[2:16:05] <Phob05> welp, guess I'll... I guess I'll play the translation one day
[2:16:08] <DSD24> Like you look up Succubus and its just a bunch of people saying how cool she is
[2:16:13] <Phob05> idk
[2:16:14] <andre11dr> @dds333a Fuck Cybele
[2:16:20] <+MakoTensei> the snes version is honestly solid
[2:16:22] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:16:32] <andre11dr> @dds333a I meant Scatach
[2:16:36] <Phob05> I gotta finish 2
[2:16:36] <+bear_breaker20> @Am_Shigar00 its actually fun for pvp stuff but its a money wall of course
[2:16:52] <DSD24> Scathach has a cool design in SMT
[2:16:55] <DSD24> I like her hat
[2:17:02] <Phob05> Thigh mom
[2:17:17] <%dds333a> @andre11dr I would've gone for Lilith next, but I'm like she's a long way off LUL
[2:17:27] <Am_Shigar00> @bear_breaker20 It was pretty neat from what I played. Shame I wasn't able to commit, I would've adored making a team of Bayo, Dante and Sonic.
[2:17:34] <%pupil31> Yoshitsune Pog
[2:17:53] <Phob05> I've got Sonic, Guts and Tachicoma
[2:17:54] <andre11dr> Lilith is also rad
[2:18:06] <andre11dr> I used have Lilith at endgame
[2:18:06] <+bear_breaker20> Sonic, Griffith, Dante, and Lucifer hmm...
[2:18:47] <Phob05> Sonic is actually useful for pvp for fast teams if you dont have a gatcha
[2:19:05] <Am_Shigar00> That's awfully fitting.
[2:19:30] <Phob05> He's only a 4 star though
[2:19:31] <%meniscate> I bet you don't even read Chekhov hmph
[2:20:01] <Am_Shigar00> He was a freebie, yeah? That tends to be the fate of such characters.
[2:20:26] <Phob05> Yeah, but you would think Sonic would get special treatment
[2:20:31] <%Zero_Jacks> Bullets that make them die. sounds good
[2:20:33] <%dds333a> Mos definitely Def
[2:20:54] <andre11dr> Wait why are we talking about Sonic, I'm so lost
[2:20:57] <Phob05> "My bullets inflict death!"
[2:21:04] <+Grayhammatter> death bullets, yep
[2:21:08] <Am_Shigar00> Sonic was an obtainable character in the SMT gacha game.
[2:21:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:21:10] <Phob05> Sonic is in the SMT mobile game
[2:21:14] <%dds333a> Randy Bullets Kappa
[2:21:32] <andre11dr> @phob05 UHHHHHHHH
[2:21:36] <Am_Shigar00> They also had events for Bayo, DMC5, Berserk, and I think Ghost in a shell.
[2:21:38] <andre11dr> Of course he is
[2:21:40] <+Grayhammatter> sleep poison and panic clips too LUL
[2:21:48] <%dds333a> I didn't wanna say LUL
[2:22:13] <%meniscate> @phob05 is he a Fiend?
[2:22:37] <Phob05> I'd like to think he's a hero order
[2:22:43] <%dds333a> Sonic is obviously a Jirae LUL
[2:22:54] <DSD24> New title time!
[2:23:01] <Phob05> My Sonic has the skill serial killer
[2:23:11] <Joestar1890> @Am_Shigar00 He had a passive skill called "Serial Killer"
[2:23:15] <%dds333a> MMX woolieGASM
[2:23:36] <Am_Shigar00> fyi, I adore that because of crossovers like these, the official wiki has articles on some of these characters. SMT wiki has an article for Sonic and the Mario Wiki as an article for stuff like Sephiroth or Bayonetta.
[2:23:55] <turboyabo> the dog dosent relly change you already talked to him
[2:24:06] <andre11dr> Holy shit, i just saw Griffith is in it
[2:24:11] <andre11dr> Wtf LUL
[2:24:26] <Phob05> Oh he's ?? order, I see
[2:24:41] <%dds333a> Underpass hobo was the music LUL
[2:24:46] <%meniscate> I think Dante and Bayo are also in Dx2
[2:24:47] <+tigerfang86> thanks, Scooby
[2:24:49] <+tigerfang86> good pup

[2:25:10] <%Zero_Jacks> lytBORK Dreams
[2:25:11] <+tigerfang86> not like THAT would ever happen
[2:25:17] <Am_Shigar00> this reminds me, there's also a P5 mod that adds in a bunch of the mobile game's demons to the persona roster, including a few crossover ones like the Skull Knight.
[2:25:18] <+Grayhammatter> that would NEVER happen
[2:25:21] <Phob05> Dante Nero V Bayo Jean and Rodin I think
[2:25:23] <%dds333a> like a web? cmonBruh
[2:25:30] <turboyabo> take his pants
[2:25:33] <%dds333a> you kooky old man
[2:25:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's a series of tubes
[2:25:45] <+bear_breaker20> nobody ever calls it electromagnetic radiation, now its all waves............
[2:26:10] <andre11dr> Damn it's actually a lot of guests, but it seems to be gatcha
[2:26:11] <DSD24> Aww yeah Lamias
[2:26:36] <KaitlynnHere> Fart bug?
[2:26:41] <Am_Shigar00> Yeah, it's a bummer that gachas get so much cool shit that the official games almost never see.
[2:26:41] <andre11dr> I hope they can bring some of this shit back in V ,you have the models done already
[2:26:42] <Qu1ckyyy> He is going L5
[2:27:11] <Am_Shigar00> I think V is mostly using modified P5 models and a couple entirely new ones.
[2:27:12] <Phob05> I would pay real money for crossover characters in a real SMT game
[2:27:29] <+bear_breaker20> @andre11dr itll prob be around for a while as they use it as an excuse to update all thier models
[2:27:31] <andre11dr> Damn this SMT phone game has so many demon, they all have pretty good looking models too
[2:27:38] <%dds333a> @am_shigar00 they're actually building them again from the ground up LUL
[2:27:53] <Phob05> It was Beloved who was the other Bayo character
[2:28:00] <KaitlynnHere> And fart bugs
[2:28:09] <%dds333a> the models are still operating off the same skeleton they've always had, but with new looks and shading
[2:28:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1430408520910917632?s=19
[2:28:12] <andre11dr> I almost want to try it but i know the gatcha shit will turn me off
[2:28:24] <Am_Shigar00> @dds333a that sounds more likely.
[2:28:30] <Murdercles> you suck their jagon
[2:28:30] <Gmanblack> Falls off, grows legs and attacks indiscriminately
[2:28:40] <KaitlynnHere> Riker seemed fine
[2:28:40] <%meniscate> sounds hot
[2:28:49] <%dds333a> @gmanblack like The Thing?
[2:28:52] <+bear_breaker20> just dont spend money and thinki of it like  amnster building challenge as early game @andre11dr
[2:29:03] <+bear_breaker20> late game is just pvp money walls tho
[2:29:06] <Gmanblack> @dds333a aw yeah
[2:29:12] <%Lion_kun> Oh my god, woolie made a star trek reference.
[2:29:14] <%townzzzzz> space booty

[2:29:27] <%dds333a> with multicolored skin LUL
[2:29:28] <KaitlynnHere> Penis force field
[2:29:29] <Phob05> pvp is the money pit
[2:29:34] <Joestar1890> Also budget reasons, cause Star Trek money was tight at the time
[2:29:38] <Murdercles> also budget constraints on the make up budget
[2:29:45] <Am_Shigar00> I can't stand pvp in games in general as is, pvp in a gacha game is just pure hell.
[2:30:11] <Phob05> But the PVE is perfectly doable without paying up
[2:30:25] <Qu1ckyyy> It always is
[2:30:26] <Gmanblack> Magnum Dong
[2:30:31] <Murdercles> it is, in fact, a big penis

[2:46:26] <Phob05> As with all moon phase dungeons it's not a good idea
[2:46:28] <+tigerfang86> that'd be one big skeleton
[2:46:34] <jetstreamlove_R> Skeletor!

[2:46:56] <andre11dr> The moon system by itself is questionable
[2:46:59] <Am_Shigar00> I remember SMT III had a moon phase portal. That was annoying to keep track of.
[2:47:07] <%dds333a> @dsd24 he's a sub boss in this one too
[2:47:14] <DSD24> Kurama Tengu is really cool
[2:47:16] <jetstreamlove_R> and called Kurama
[2:47:17] <turboyabo> kurana the grunt
[2:47:24] <TheDwarvenBard> Kurama is great
[2:47:27] <Phob05> The moon system is beast when it's barely felt

[2:56:38] <KaitlynnHere> Oh my god, he had a console?!

[2:57:25] <%livlinn> oldgrayExcited
[2:57:29] <andre11dr> I think his trolling
[2:57:35] <%dds333a> Own shares in Atari Coin LUL

[2:59:11] <DSD24> Damn Reggie
[2:59:14] <andre11dr> But does he?
[2:59:23] <lotharrio> If we're being generous, he was probably being tapped for a promotional deal, but he decided that it would take the form of him declaring himself the owner of the company.
[2:59:29] <andre11dr> I don't think his doing that good
[2:59:31] <turboyabo> souljay boy with his bootleg consoles
[2:59:32] <%dds333a> pretty boy too
[2:59:33] <Murdercles> they are called "handlers" in the business
[2:59:35] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Well the document he pulled up looks like it's a marketing agreement that means he just gets more tokens if the price of Atari Coin hit's certain price points, so just a pump
[2:59:38] <andre11dr> He has 2 hits that's it
[2:59:53] <andre11dr> Ans nobody cares about him anymore
[2:59:56] <%thedankestmeeme> "Hey soulja boy can I-" YAHH TRICK YAAHH

[3:02:03] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @bear_breaker20 I have no clue if it was even them who sent it to him or the exchange or what. A good chunk of it was obscured by his face cam
[3:02:06] <xeros720> it's hilarious when it does work on bosses though
[3:02:11] <Phob05> There IS a boss in SMT IV that can be instrakilled
[3:02:12] <%Prevot> instant death is always the worst
[3:02:16] <%dds333a> LUL

[3:02:52] <DarkestDom> LUL
[3:02:56] <KaitlynnHere> Oh my god, I just imagined snoop dogg realizing his stream is muted through the news
[3:02:59] <+bear_breaker20> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx hes trying to use bullshit matter to try and manifest a future where he does own atari... my god
[3:03:17] <%RigmaroleHM> VoteNay SingsMic

[3:04:57] <%dds333a> now, it's at it's best
[3:05:05] <Am_Shigar00> there's a reason why Persona doesn't have it.

[3:06:36] <andre11dr> God remember the Moon puzzles in Nocturne? shit
[3:06:51] <Phob05> Remember magic chests
[3:06:54] <Qu1ckyyy> The moon puzzles were fun math tho

Seeing al these pop culture characters in a video game dab as the "I have a Dream" speech plays sure fills me with an indescribable emotion I tell you what.
[3:24:49] <+vaderxyz1970> Type: Plot
[3:24:52] <turboyabo> you have to accidently fusion them
[3:25:04] <%dds333a> they're like the zombies, Red Cape, and Special Guard, they can't be obtained under normal circumstances
[3:25:15] <%dds333a> @turboyabo exactly
[3:25:32] <%dds333a> GYET EM

[3:31:09] <andre11dr> And even then, a lot of demons just look like people
[3:31:21] <xeros720> raidou and gotou are definitely pro murder, they just are avoiding those pesky "laws"
[3:31:33] <%dds333a> @andre11dr although, they're just demons still, but yeah LUL
[3:31:37] <+bear_breaker20> getting some pokemon XD vibes here

[3:52:05] <%meniscate> @andre11dr I'd rather have seen a SJ LP. Some parts are so fucking dope. He could've let Reggie play if he'd already completed it himself
[3:52:16] <%dds333a> @moonmintparadise demons that talk LiKE tHiS aren't intelligent
[3:52:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:52:30] <andre11dr> @dds333a I don't want to imagine any of the P2 dungeons in Woolies hands
[3:53:04] <%dds333a> I always check. no matter what LUL
[3:53:08] <KaitlynnHere> Did P2 have those dungeons that looked like a windows xp idle screens?
[3:53:19] <Am_Shigar00> I lost track of how many times I've been sent back exploring these pathways.
[3:53:24] <xeros720> @andre11dr i believe in reggie
[3:53:33] <Am_Shigar00> I was using a freaking Turdak during this section too.
[3:53:34] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:53:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Woolie VS Woolie
[3:53:39] <%dds333a> @kaitlynnhere depends on what you mean Kappa
[3:53:40] <andre11dr> And while I love Strange Journey, where never getting an LP of that either
[3:54:04] <andre11dr> Imagine some of those map played at Woolie pase
[3:54:05] <KaitlynnHere> @dds333a you know what I mean
[3:54:24] <%meniscate> Maybe an LP of the DeSu games then? They're pretty much just Persona x FE
[3:55:10] <andre11dr> DDS could happen, those are not that bad when it comes to accessibility
[3:55:17] <RiderSensei> Are you sure you want to save?
[3:55:20] <Murdercles> its not worth it just go to the boss LUL
[3:55:24] <KaitlynnHere> Smt 4 might be a good option
[3:55:29] <%dds333a> yeah. it's nothing LUL
[3:55:30] <xeros720> "hold on raidou, you should drop a fat save"
[3:55:40] <andre11dr> He did 4 already
[3:55:47] <KaitlynnHere> Oh he did?
[3:55:52] <KaitlynnHere> Didn’t know that
[3:55:52] <%dds333a> He's already played IV, but maybe we could get a reggie vs
[3:55:54] <andre11dr> But 4 A might be pretty fun
[3:55:59] <%meniscate> Devil Survivor's Naoya route would knock Woolie's socks off
[3:56:14] <%dds333a> I was about to mention the games he has and hasn't played, which is IV
[3:56:32] <Am_Shigar00> you know, a map edit mode where you could draw out the routes depending and who they go with would not be a bad idea for a puzzle like this, just saying.
[3:57:05] <%dds333a> He's mentioned DDS more than once on the channel, but according to what he says, it seems he hasn't played it
[3:57:10] <KaitlynnHere> So how many smt games are there in total? Minus the spin offs
[3:57:25] <%dds333a> @kaitlynnhere oh boy
[3:57:26] <andre11dr> if probably not going to happen
[3:57:44] <andre11dr> Never played if but i hear it can be pretty obtuse
[3:57:50] <%meniscate> @kaitlynnhere Mainline Smt? There are 6 (some say even 7)
[3:57:52] <%livlinn> oldgrayLeave
[3:57:59] <Am_Shigar00> @KaitlynnHere Mainline titles? Depends on what you count as a spin-off. Ranges from 5 to 7 I'd argue.
[3:58:06] <@Menitta> Does Megami Tensei count
[3:58:10] <%meniscate> Technically 9 but still
[3:58:12] <%dds333a> gross LUL
[3:58:19] <drunken_lemur> Is that intentional?
[3:58:22] <+vaderxyz1970> Im getting some Parasite Eve energy going on
[3:58:24] <%livlinn> noooo NotLikeThis
[3:58:26] <KaitlynnHere> I don’t know how far the spin offs go
[3:58:44] <KaitlynnHere> I’d meant like persona and mirage
[3:58:45] <%livlinn> more like bean can
[3:58:51] <%meniscate> Ahh, eating natto every morning. I miss those days
[3:58:55] <andre11dr> Isn't SMT a fan game of Megami Tensei?
[3:59:17] <%dds333a> @andre11dr the spinoff/reboot LUL

[3:59:29] <Am_Shigar00> @KaitlynnHere As an example, if... is not a numbered entry, but it's built on the same foundation as 1 & 2 and was a part of the mainline SMTs in the original SMT x FE trailer. Would you consider than mainline?

[4:03:51] <xeros720> yeah, this guy gave me a game over too

[4:07:01] <KaitlynnHere> @andre11dr which one?
[4:07:08] <%dds333a> @andre11dr hence the "sea of Suwa"
[4:07:09] <xeros720> i always thought it had a giant scalpel like Faust
[4:07:23] <andre11dr> It says he's known to have a phallic appearance so this is actually pretty accurate LUL
[4:07:36] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:07:37] <KaitlynnHere> So, he’s an eel?
[4:07:58] <Am_Shigar00> @andre11dr You should look up his alternate design if you haven't already. It's even more blatant in it's phalliciness.
[4:08:01] <%meniscate> penetrate Kreygasm Kreygasm

[4:08:40] <Murdercles> "I need someone with Dia Aura" LUL
[4:08:42] <OblivionSword1> well shit
[4:08:43] <Am_Shigar00> That suuuuuucks
[4:08:45] <RiderSensei> yoshitsune healed him
[4:08:46] <Kira2993> oof
[4:08:50] <%meniscate> oh no Yoshitsune's getting heart pupils
[4:08:52] <andre11dr> Yeah this dude is for real
[4:09:01] <+Grayhammatter> i think that was the dia aura that did it
[4:09:11] <RiderSensei> he was charmed
[4:09:13] <Phob05> This is one of the bosses
[4:09:20] <%meniscate> got mindbroken
[4:09:30] <Phob05> Nebiros nulls mind tho
[4:09:34] <Am_Shigar00> I remember turning my demon off during this latter phase for this exact reason
[4:09:43] <%dds333a> but he still casts Cursed Bolt
[4:09:46] <+bear_breaker20> ushiwakimaru getting charmed by dick demons hmmm?
[4:09:51] <%dds333a> so uh oh
[4:10:59] <%dds333a> smacked him LUL
[4:11:24] <Am_Shigar00> "I will smack you wish my dick!"

[4:13:46] <Am_Shigar00> This fight is super brutal.
[4:14:05] <Phob05> This boss was a cakewalk for me the first time around because I think I used Nebiros

[4:15:01] <big_oki> WELCOME TO SMT GUYS
[4:15:12] <xeros720> i either had to grind levels or get a new weapon to beat him myself
[4:15:15] <andre11dr> That's like the 4th restart
[4:15:32] <CarmineAcciai> Every SMT boss has a weakness to my knowledge.
[4:15:33] <andre11dr> @big_oki It took a while really
[4:15:45] <penitentpendant> I thought "Rule of boss" was "Kill adds first"
[4:15:47] <%dds333a> @carmineacciai far from it, in fact
[4:15:50] <xeros720> Gdon says he's strong to mind at least
[4:15:52] <Kira2993> LUL
[4:15:54] <andre11dr> Usually the second boss is this
[4:16:02] <+KaguraRaion> @CarmineAcciai Not true
[4:16:06] <andre11dr> They where nicer in this game
[4:16:10] <Phob05> Chill the dick
[4:16:27] <Phob05> I think Gdon is strong to mind too
[4:16:27] <Am_Shigar00> Makes sense the penis is weak to ice.
[4:16:29] <%dds333a> Gotta calm down the heat LUL
[4:16:30] <lotharrio> Universe has collapsed.
[4:16:41] <penitentpendant> The wall between universes hold
[4:16:41] <lotharrio> We only have the singularity of the game.
[4:16:42] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Heat death of the universe
[4:16:53] <CarmineAcciai> I mean, short of superbosses and stuff.
[4:16:59] <penitentpendant> This boss proves the power of SHRINKAGE
[4:16:59] <Enyoyable> Universe didn't backseat. SeemsGood
[4:17:29] <%dds333a> even then, in every SMT game, past the halfway point into the end of the game, bosses drop having weaknesses
[4:17:52] <%dds333a> only in some standout cases, usually due to mythology, do they do so
[4:18:02] <OblivionSword1> oh boy the youtube peeps are gonna love this part
[4:18:08] <Am_Shigar00> that cat is good on his magic, but really struggles on actually landing the claw, huh.
[4:18:15] <%dds333a> @oblivionsword1 you bet LUL
[4:18:47] <lotharrio> Wait, was the weakness ice the whole time?
[4:18:58] <%dds333a> @lotharrio sure was
[4:19:14] <lotharrio> That's unfortunate.
[4:19:40] <xeros720> guess you need null mind to stop it

[4:22:55] <%dds333a> @killercrocomire indeed, in a comparatively easier game, but Mishaguji can be a fuck. Rasputin is the first real challenge of the game too
[4:23:10] <andre11dr> Honestly this is not even really rough
[4:23:27] <xeros720> the engine just makes it hard to deal with
[4:23:33] <andre11dr> It's hard but there's definitely way harder shit out there
[4:23:38] <Am_Shigar00> @dds333a Ratsputin was my first death in this game, I'm pretty sure Mishaguji was my second.
[4:23:42] <%dds333a> @andre11dr exactly, hence "can"
[4:24:17] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:24:48] <%dds333a> He got the moral victory, he made you use the Bead Chain Kappa
