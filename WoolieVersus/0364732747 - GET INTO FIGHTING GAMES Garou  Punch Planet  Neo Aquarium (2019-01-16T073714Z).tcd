[0:00:01] <Outbound_Salvo> Oh neat. Woolie's fighting game skills on stream. :P
[0:00:02] <CalderGaming> @jubejube56 maximilian and co were talking about this recently. part of the issue is that JP developers often approach their games with JP internet in mind, which is a lot more forgiving because it's strong throughout the country

[0:03:45] <%GohanEgret> call of duty gives up XP for losing, for example
[0:03:49] <PP_Willpower> punchpMaxxchamp punchpMaxxchamp
[0:03:49] <%GohanEgret> you xp*
[0:04:02] <@akuda_bar> @GohanEgret fighting games'll do that too
[0:04:08] <+Mnast52> punchpMaxxchamp punchpMaxxchamp punchpMaxxchamp
[0:04:11] <ExplosionForce> Woolie teaching you kids how to fight Game
[0:04:16] <%Wool> where's the Touhou expert
[0:04:16] <reonome> but what if I am at the bottom :(
[0:04:23] <+PersonaQueen18> That MSI laptop looks killer. Would die for one of those.
[0:04:32] <%GohanEgret> @akuda_bar yeah but CoD, at least from when I played, would just bombard you with bars to fill up, so even losing could feel like progress
[0:04:33] <+Oak_bogle> Teach us Punch Daddy
[0:04:34] <PP_Willpower> LUL
[0:04:36] <%Solidus_113> are we going to stick to 2D fighters most of the time, or are we gonna stretch to weird arena stuff like Naruto Storm or Pokken? @WoolieVersus
[0:04:38] <xeros720> there's the winner and fucking wrekt
[0:04:40] <PP_Willpower> it's just important to haff fun
[0:04:48] <PP_Willpower> win or lose
[0:04:50] <jimmypurple> i would say that it doesnt bare your ego, it more tells you that your previous skill set means nothing
[0:04:53] <+Troispoint> 2 snuggly black men
[0:04:57] <%Menitta> Oh man I;d get hype if he played Pokken
[0:05:01] <JDebss> When do we reach back into the barrel tho?
[0:05:04] <+conqab> problem is losing isnt usually fun
[0:05:08] <CalderGaming> "it's a human!"
[0:05:12] <+Dova573> is this gonna be the steam version of garuo?
[0:05:15] <+PersonaQueen18> The legacy lives on, in another form...
[0:05:16] <gustavozxd> almost every time i shared my things, i got fucked over though
[0:05:32] <@akuda_bar> what the hell does it say on that can, "GIJBU"?
[0:05:36] <iamtheTwitchghost> that dev tweet about gears of war blew my mind
[0:05:39] <xeros720> that fuckin bs that GoW did was amazing
[0:05:46] <drefizz> LOL
[0:05:54] <%Menitta> It looks like Super
[0:05:59] <%Menitta> No thats a G alright
[0:06:01] <+GreasyMcBeef> @akuda_bar i think it's a guru
[0:06:02] <xeros720> i think it lowered how much damage you took when you were on a losing streak too
[0:06:04] <+conqab> that's subjective
[0:06:05] <3Xgilly> yeyeyeyeyeye
[0:06:06] <gustavozxd> 2 times where I never got my videogame disc back, cousin broke multiple toys, best friend almost stole toys, fucking bs LUL
[0:06:08] <Gehtingsberg> Tetris has the same situation
[0:06:11] <jetstreamisthebest> people usually say losing is actually good and you can learn from it, but if you constantly lose its hard to feel like you're improving
[0:06:13] <@akuda_bar> oh yeah guru looks plausible
[0:06:31] <xeros720> it's definitely why you want someone roughly as good as you
[0:06:34] <+PleasantLee> I'm gonna try so hard
[0:06:40] <xeros720> you want to win as much as you lose, roughly
[0:06:52] <AggsMK7> Good enough for a job interview
[0:06:56] <Kristoffers> good concept
[0:06:58] <+Oak_bogle> ”Sometimes the only thing you learn from losing is that you lost”
[0:06:58] <+hidef_sarge> didn't woolie fight diago
[0:06:58] <+TransporterX7> And then it'll get SUPER HOT and there's an inevitable ft10
[0:07:02] <JDebss> Wen Pat?
[0:07:03] <digitaldenam> oh man garou
[0:07:04] <+PersonaQueen18> "Not professionals" says the man who has become an iconic gateway to fighting games.
[0:07:08] <%Tbnero> Garou is king of Poverty
[0:07:09] <+hidef_sarge> doesn't that make woolie a pro
[0:07:30] <gustavozxd> one thing I don't like about some fighting games is when the game tells me how many times i lost or win/loss % man do i feel bad when I look at that
[0:07:39] <CalderGaming> "You got me back in"... to naruto
[0:07:44] <%PinkieTheEerie> "not professional" says man who gets maybe a hundred thousand people into fighting games.
[0:07:44] <JDebss> ^
[0:07:45] <%Knopantz> Pro means you get paid to do it. So Woolie is a professional trash.
[0:07:49] <xeros720> Woolie is fighting for the concept of fighting games in real life and winning
[0:07:51] <LameBanshee> It's a big L, tho
[0:07:51] <%Knopantz> woolieSMUG
[0:07:56] <%bigbradish> Watching old fisticuffs is what got me in
[0:08:02] <%Tbnero> woolieWHENS
[0:08:02] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:08:05] <+PersonaQueen18> MARK OF THE WOLVES, AWOOOOOOO
[0:08:09] <%Sunriser41> fiscuffs did get me interested in actually learning fighting games
[0:08:10] <Bazookya> PogChamp
[0:08:12] <tacostarvedbeast> I expect pop offs @woolieversus
[0:08:12] <HotHungryHurricane> REGGiE SEE MY GRANT
[0:08:13] <%Tbnero> which version is this?
[0:08:13] <Kristoffers> I know the translation is ba-YEP
[0:08:14] <%GohanEgret> OhMyDog
[0:08:14] <dukenux> OwO
[0:08:14] <gatorafan> I heard Garou and I abandoned EVERYTHING doodStare
[0:08:15] <CalderGaming> ps4?
[0:08:17] <southstarshen> roll it back to Garou
[0:08:21] <JDebss> That's a fucking good start
[0:08:24] <RcMacPanther22> Live Pop Off Report News ?
[0:08:25] <digitaldenam> Does woolie know about all the crazy cancelling shit you can do in this?
[0:08:28] <%Solidus_113> so everyone who wants to get in later, they're playing Garou on the PS4
[0:08:29] <dukenux> Wait, is that Terry
[0:08:29] <+primax104> RIP fisticuffs
[0:08:30] <gustavozxd> I bought the steam version of this and didn't even boot up, just bought it cause this game is godlike
[0:08:31] <dukenux> it is
[0:08:31] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[0:08:33] <scoot_io> Give us the LORE
[0:08:37] <Deadpool2450> WHENS GAROU 2
[0:08:38] <jimmypurple> i think ranked games are more hard to learn to succeed through loss, because you dont have just "Ok in this moment i didn't reflect" or "Here, i messed up my combo" Ranked games are "I got flashed, so i need to memorize these new flash spots"
[0:08:38] <+entrement> PS4 @Tbnero

[0:08:59] <+Dova573> What system woolie?
[0:09:00] <%Tbnero> my opinion
[0:09:00] <+PersonaQueen18> It blows my mind that Rock has existed for this long.

[0:12:22] <+PersonaQueen18> Do you ever wonder about the audiences in Fighting games? Like are they warned about the fight taht's about to happen before hand or do they just see two guys start kicking the tar out of each other for seemingly no reason and just stick around?
[0:12:24] <%Knopantz> Panda girl?!?!

[0:13:40] <xeros720> i'd say something about pads being fine, but that console fuckin shipped with arcade sticks
[0:13:41] <%sou1less_> @ecksbockstreefitty its really good
[0:13:42] <kaine_west> I've never actually seen gameplay for this outside of the fisticuffs vid
[0:13:42] <+PJSmooth> Buster wolf started here
[0:13:42] <Kristoffers> straight from the tap
[0:13:43] <Bazookya> terry's best outfit
[0:13:44] <CalderGaming> this is where the buster wolf comes from, isn't it? it was just power geyser before that?

[0:14:09] <hunterstuff> i know that some special moves you can break, and that's apparently the core of combos
[0:14:21] <+SuichiTanaka> You can fake supers as well.
[0:14:24] <AggsMK7> ! BATTERY AT RISK !
[0:14:32] <+NarcissistCactus> professionalism
[0:14:32] <CalderGaming> @AggsMK7 beat me to it

[0:15:09] <@akuda_bar> @KR_Black his name is reggie, he's been on the naruto lp and was in the pop off report
[0:15:10] <CalderGaming> remember character-specific interactions in fighting games?
[0:15:13] <+PleasantLee> yup, I still cant go 720
[0:15:19] <digital_pinp> wen's mahvel?
[0:15:22] <+PersonaQueen18> Oh! B.Jenet! So this is the game she came from!
[0:15:26] <kaine_west> playing 2D fgs on a pad has always been weird to me, always associated pad with Tekken, Sol Cal, 3D fgs
[0:15:42] <+hidef_sarge> i can't use a stick personally
[0:15:43] <+KR_Black> @hidef_sarge from Nintendo ? Kappa @akuda_bar thanks man
[0:15:49] <+hidef_sarge> they don't make sense
[0:15:53] <+SuichiTanaka> Reggie is one of Woolie's local fighting game friends, who's become more of a general game/LP partner as of late.
[0:15:55] <+NarcissistCactus> fighting games still have character specific interactions
[0:15:55] <kaine_west> me eithet
[0:16:01] <%sou1less_> i only use pad on NRS games
[0:16:03] <Emdhad> i can't electrics on pad so i use a stick for tekken
[0:16:04] <digitaldenam> @kaine_west Yeah I get that, I usually play SNK games on pad because they're 4 buttons

[0:16:41] <kaine_west> my mind goes blank whenever I play any 2d/3d game in the arcade, never knew SNK games were 4 button either
[0:16:44] <%xeromage> you can tell it's a real fight when they both go silent
[0:16:53] <JDebss> I wish I could play with a fight stick but my left arm just isn't coordinated enough

[0:18:47] <+PersonaQueen18> SNk Heroines was just...why take girls loved for being badass and flaunting them like....that
[0:18:49] <BearSawed> Needs more rising tackle
[0:18:49] <gustavozxd> Vanessa is godlike which is why I don't wanna see her in snk heroines LUL
[0:18:53] <kaine_west> man somebody's gotta explain SNK fighter lore to me, shits so rad man
[0:18:54] <+SuichiTanaka> KoF 13 has nicer sprites, but the animation in this game still holds up today. It's gorgeous.

[0:19:47] <gustavozxd> kof13 looks pretty but stuff like repeated animations are.... weird

[0:20:16] <gustavozxd> king's crouching light and heavy kick are the exact same animation, just slightly slower
[0:20:18] <nawleenspoboy> the fake naruto boy is dam good too
[0:20:21] <Emdhad> they didn't fuck up per se but the DBFZ stream didn't announce anything
[0:20:29] <Doc1790> Is Woolie playing Butt?
[0:20:29] <+conqab> shout out to kush AND nood butt
[0:20:31] <+SuichiTanaka> IIRC, Butt is the current main practitioner of Kyokugen Karate, which is the style Kyo, Robert, and Yuri use
[0:20:33] <$Rezca> pogchamp150 when's the next bottom barrel fighting game?
[0:20:36] <rufus2k2> that said, put Kid Goku in the game and all is forgiven
[0:20:36] <thebmanishere> butt is the best name don't @ me
[0:20:39] <+PersonaQueen18> Isn't it weird that it's just a totally accepted fact in these worlds that some people can just shoot balls of energy.
[0:20:42] <Belutima> wasnt this suppose to be KOF answer to 3rd strike?
[0:20:44] <%Klefth> Welp

[0:21:53] <rufus2k2> Hotaru you a pervert
[0:21:55] <+SuichiTanaka> This is sort of SNK's 3rd Strike, yeah. It's a pretty well balanced game with a lot of little subtleties and a defensive system in 'Just Defense' which is the opposite of parries
[0:21:58] <+Xalgar> BUTT
[0:21:58] <AggsMK7> Dong vs Butt

[0:23:27] <Belutima> did someone say medabots?
[0:23:29] <Doc1790> I wish Hokutomaru was just the son of Mai and Andy. But SNK are cowards.
[0:23:35] <seylumiue> wasnt she narancia in ASB too
[0:23:43] <+Dungeon00X> sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo
[0:23:50] <rufus2k2> Freeman Free
[0:23:54] <Emdhad> It's actually Andy thats the coward in that situation
[0:23:55] <+PersonaQueen18> Freeman's fighting style looks strangely familiar....
[0:23:58] <drefizz> ...
[0:24:00] <mercado94> yup. sounds a lot like Narancia
[0:24:02] <gustavozxd> there's a really funny baby related intro between andy and mai in kof 2002 tho
[0:24:02] <gatorafan> It took until XIV for SNK to say "yeah, maybe they are dating now"
[0:24:02] <vriskybusiness8> Yeah! compete with pat ! prove your superior stream!
[0:24:03] <HotHungryHurricane> TIZOC
[0:24:17] <Johnny2490> Claw Iori you thinkg of?
[0:24:22] <+SuichiTanaka> TIZOC is bae
[0:24:34] <+PersonaQueen18> Yeah or uhhhh....the crazy thug guy from KOF
[0:24:39] <+projectmanatees> kain did nothing wrong fight me
[0:24:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Man these designs are still so fucking dope
[0:24:54] <Johnny2490> Kain just wanted to make Southtown great again.
[0:24:56] <%Menitta> I wish KOFXI was ported. I just wanna play that game.
[0:24:58] <AggsMK7> Gato: Back to Solomon
[0:25:01] <Emdhad> @personaqueen18 Yamazaki? the dude with the knife?
[0:25:02] <Doc1790> Is Kain broken or is he just the Final Boss?
[0:25:05] <+PersonaQueen18> YEAH
[0:25:07] <+PersonaQueen18> That's the one
[0:25:07] <drefizz> @MyNameIsRasus not as dope as you beautiful
[0:25:10] <+SuichiTanaka> Kain is the boss
[0:25:12] <Emdhad> He's rad
[0:25:17] <Johnny2490> He's not too broken.
[0:25:23] <Doc1790> OK goody
[0:25:25] <drefizz> lytCRAZY
[0:25:25] <Johnny2490> But in 1p Mode on round 2
[0:25:25] <Quikanims> real talknow what did kain do?
[0:25:30] <+PersonaQueen18> I haven't played a KOF game in....ages
[0:25:32] <Emdhad> KoF bosses are always fair and balanced
[0:25:32] <+NarcissistCactus> nothing wrong
[0:25:32] <Johnny2490> They give him Full T.O.P
[0:25:36] <MyNameIsRasus> @drefizz <3 <3
[0:25:39] <+dr_ddoooooom> finish him off with that sweet grab
[0:25:40] <gustavozxd> when's Woolie gonna play koihime enbu LUL
[0:25:44] <%PinkieTheEerie> @WoolieVersus thats beacuse of the ps4 port
[0:25:44] <+PersonaQueen18> Almost all fighting game bosses are broken lol
[0:25:57] <gustavozxd> especially the snk ones
[0:26:01] <Johnny2490> So he'll always be doing 25% more damage.
[0:26:02] <fgiting> did woolie say what games are being played tonight?
[0:26:02] <%jinking79> that's how bad ps4 controllers r still
[0:26:04] <+PersonaQueen18> Oof yeah
[0:26:05] <+DesertOfSand> Lol I misread "thug" as "hug" and thought you meant Xanadu
[0:26:09] <Emdhad> Flashbacks to God Rugal BibleThump
[0:26:10] <+DesertOfSand> I was really confused when someone suggested Yamazaki
[0:26:13] <+projectmanatees> did kain and geese ever fight/meet? probably in a dream match game right?
[0:26:13] <gatorafan> Play Breakers! PogChamp
[0:26:17] <Johnny2490> Kain is...tame compared to older SNK bosses.
[0:26:18] <%Menitta> If anyone hasn't already, go look at the freaking fighting game background gif imgur album
[0:26:19] <+PersonaQueen18> I still get flashbacks to Rugal
[0:26:19] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Who's here with Woolie chatroom
[0:26:23] <%PinkieTheEerie> its cause of this port
[0:26:24] <%Menitta> its amaaaaazing
[0:26:25] <+Dungeon00X> Hey Woolie, who is your friend?
[0:26:28] <%PinkieTheEerie> this port has imput lag
[0:26:29] <+TransporterX7> It's almost like a controller's dying
[0:26:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> Kain's only real gimmick as a boss is a full-bar TOP on round 2
[0:26:39] <%Menitta> The Vita port was better oddly enough
[0:26:44] <Emdhad> It's a port thing
[0:26:47] <%PinkieTheEerie> yea this port is WORSE online
[0:26:49] <NeroCapone> whos p1 and p2?
[0:26:51] <%PinkieTheEerie> so good luck with that
[0:26:52] <+TransporterX7> I kid I have no idea
[0:26:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> what port are you guys playing? because if that's the damn PC version done by DotEmu
[0:26:58] <+SuichiTanaka> SNK games are pretty strict with their execution too, so it's not a good match up with input lag
[0:26:58] <JDebss> TIZOC>King of dinosaurs
[0:27:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> then it's guaranteed butt
[0:27:03] <%Klefth> Play it on fightcade, maybe?
[0:27:04] <drefizz> is this the twitch prime port?
[0:27:05] <%Menitta> Its the Code Mystics PS4 port
[0:27:05] <CalderGaming> were there better ports on ps3 or xbone?
[0:27:06] <vriskybusiness8> vita > all
[0:27:09] <+PersonaQueen18> Tizoc is definitely the better incarnation
[0:27:12] <+projectmanatees> XBL had a good port of this
[0:27:13] <+PersonaQueen18> As much as I love dinoasurs
[0:27:21] <Johnny2490> Dino is his hell persona.
[0:27:22] <+kimonochrono> i thought this port was fine except the online lol
[0:27:24] <Johnny2490> *heel
[0:27:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think the PS4/Vita version is certainly better, they did last blade 2 and samsho v
[0:27:30] <+tigerfang86> BARNING
[0:27:30] <kennyjetjackson> Are you okay?
[0:27:31] <%PinkieTheEerie> @WoolieVersus this port has input lag baked in from what ive heard. its a issue
[0:27:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> done by code mystics
[0:27:35] <%keystone_yinzer> @NeroCapone P1 is Woolie
[0:27:36] <+kimonochrono> ro[
[0:27:37] <+PersonaQueen18> "Nothing comes from defeat."
[0:27:39] <+kimonochrono> rip*
[0:27:48] <NeroCapone> okay thank you
[0:27:49] <RoboXGP> I need to play svc chaos, it has Zero from megaman in it
[0:27:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> @WoolieVersus this is the codemystics version right?
[0:27:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> or is it Dotemu?
[0:28:02] <digitaldenam> @kimonochrono yeah code mystics netplay isn't usually the best.
[0:28:03] <%DaniSaintDani> Can you guys help me remember a SNES 2D fighting game where everyone had a weapon and you could disarm each other in a match?
[0:28:07] <+SuichiTanaka> I *love* SVC Chaos. I know it's trash, but I still love it.
[0:28:12] <gatorafan> SvC chaos is a very weird game
[0:28:12] <%PinkieTheEerie> @WoolieVersus its syned to the frame rate i think, it buffers too sometimes
[0:28:15] <RoboXGP> bloody war maybe?
[0:28:16] <AggsMK7> Samurai Shodown @DaniSaintDani
[0:28:19] <RoboXGP> bloody roar i mean
[0:28:21] <gustavozxd> zero is awkward to play as in svc though
[0:28:26] <+kimonochrono> at least theres fightcade
[0:28:32] <digitaldenam> @Guntanks_in_Space code mystics
[0:28:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> SVC Zero he is top tier though lol
[0:28:38] <+PersonaQueen18> We're never gonna see another Bloody Roar and that makes me sad.
[0:28:41] <%DaniSaintDani> @AggsMK7 travHert
[0:28:46] <digitaldenam> god I hate dotemu
[0:28:47] <gustavozxd> I heard he's good, but he's not easy to use
[0:28:59] <megafangking> Whats up boys! Woolie + Garou = Awesome stream! PogChamp
[0:28:59] <rufus2k2> Isn't that Baki's brother
[0:29:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> @digitaldenam hm, i didn't know there was innate input lag in that port, but the other streamer i followed hated the dotemu PC version, but was all right with this one lol
[0:29:01] <%Menitta> Code Mystic ports are hit or miss
[0:29:01] <GoldeNOVA> You 100% need Fightcade set up, it's great.
[0:29:06] <Johnny2490> Boy were wrong.
[0:29:07] <Emdhad> Never trust a dude with two first names
[0:29:08] <twin_triggers> ok so whats woolie call his followers?
[0:29:09] <+tigerfang86> KEVIN
[0:29:10] <rufus2k2> aka Jack Hanma?
[0:29:14] <twin_triggers> what do we call outselves
[0:29:14] <gatorafan> Play the "original Neo Geo" cartridge Kappa
[0:29:14] <+NarcissistCactus> his juggles are stupid
[0:29:25] <rufus2k2> @twin_triggers Woolites, what else
[0:29:31] <megafangking> Discount Guile?
[0:29:32] <@akuda_bar> isn't that a cleaning product
[0:29:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> Kevin is the true boss character in Garou
[0:29:41] <twin_triggers> well some people got their own things. Like Hutts
[0:29:45] <%IMDRanged> woolieS woolieT
[0:29:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> he's just mad busted
[0:29:47] <%IMDRanged> woolieF woolieU
[0:29:53] <digitaldenam> @Guntanks_in_Space Yeah, i didn't notice any lag when I played it, but oh man DotEmu ports are the worst
[0:29:54] <%IMDRanged> Damn, so close
[0:29:54] <@akuda_bar> reckt
[0:29:56] <%Menitta> you tried
[0:29:58] <+PersonaQueen18> Stryker or Ryan, who wins in most boring cop fighter design
[0:29:58] <jay521> Who's that
[0:30:00] <TAGMANINK> Whens Woolie Vs Game Goons?
[0:30:04] <Emdhad> c-c-combo breaker
[0:30:05] <RoboXGP> Primal rage is a game on the SNES
[0:30:17] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Kevin looks like a Clark... Is Kevin a Clark?
[0:30:19] <@Commando_Joe> octoItsTime octoTo
[0:30:21] <@Commando_Joe> octoOil woolieGASM
[0:30:21] <SciurusAlpha> This reminds me of king of fighters.
[0:30:22] <+SuichiTanaka> Ryan looks less rent a cop
[0:30:25] <gatorafan> Kevin is more like a ralf
[0:30:30] <twin_triggers> yes he's a ralk
[0:30:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> @TAGMANINK man i'd love Woolie Vs. Game Goons for sure lol
[0:30:32] <twin_triggers> ralf
[0:30:37] <+KaiserCrimson_1> I'll take that too lol
[0:30:38] <Quikanims> Kevin Ryan is far worse than Stryker
[0:30:41] <megafangking> Id also say Ralf
[0:30:54] <+PersonaQueen18> Yeah he's got a real Ralf posture
[0:30:57] <damiensiegfried> what'd iiiii miss?
[0:30:57] <TAGMANINK> GivePLZ TakeNRG
[0:31:01] <+JustToWatch> have they made a Baki fighting game
[0:31:05] <twin_triggers> i fot this while it was on sale on the -s4
[0:31:19] <damiensiegfried> Baki is the only anime worthy of a fighting game
[0:31:24] <damiensiegfried> aside from Hajime
[0:31:24] <Emdhad> @justtowatch they have and i believe it was even on scrublords
[0:31:26] <megafangking> I unironically like playing Butt.
[0:31:27] <AggsMK7> Cop Naruto
[0:31:27] <+kimonochrono> oof online is gonna be rough
[0:31:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> @JustToWatch basically you pick garouden breakblow, the actual baki the grappler ps2 fighter, or buriki one
[0:31:39] <twin_triggers> well there's also Hajime no Ippo
[0:31:40] <+PersonaQueen18> Cop Naruto brought so many wild images to mind
[0:31:46] <megafangking> Terry #1 though! :D
[0:31:47] <CalderGaming> suddenly, ONLINE
[0:31:49] <SciurusAlpha> is this final-fight?

[0:32:20] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @personaqueen18 “I’m gonna be Hokage of the precinct!”
[0:32:21] <damiensiegfried> plain dragon ball, hajime no ipppo, and Baki are the only anime worthy of fighting games
[0:32:28] <vriskybusiness8> terry looks so cool holy shit
[0:32:29] <+GreatMonorail> everyone is streaming today
[0:32:29] <Daxalog> KICK KBACK

[0:33:01] <%Klefth> Member when fighting games had beautiful fucking stages?
[0:33:03] <digitaldenam> impromptu blow ups
[0:33:04] <Zayasu> SourPls
[0:33:06] <%AntithesisEK> ah man this is THE track
[0:33:06] <+SuichiTanaka> SNK supers are almost never for counters, they're meant as damage cashouts on combos
[0:33:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> CHILDREN!
[0:33:13] <getsmokedyo> THIS MUSIC
[0:33:14] <twin_triggers> the gundam game on snes was an amazing fighting game too
[0:33:16] <%Dungeon00X> KO!
[0:33:20] <gensoukaizou> tdogLurk
[0:33:24] <TopLeftCenter> JD cancels and counter hit combos in this game are so fun
[0:33:24] <+NarcissistCactus> implying fighting games don't still have good stages
[0:33:25] <megafangking> Stand Up!
[0:33:35] <CalderGaming> there it is!
[0:33:37] <twin_triggers> thats the one
[0:33:39] <+kimonochrono> yooo

[0:33:45] <alexpandajoker> PogChamp
[0:33:48] <ExplosionForce> yoooooo
[0:33:48] <+PersonaQueen18> Really love Ultra combos/supers that are counters. Those are always satisfying to land.
[0:33:49] <damiensiegfried> good stages, yes. beautiful ones, not often
[0:33:50] <drefizz> Arksys should make a power rangers fighting game
[0:33:52] <iamtheTwitchghost> HE WON PogChamp
[0:33:53] <AlisaBoss> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:33:54] <+mister_rogers> yo woolz are you only doing garou today?
[0:33:57] <BearSawed> can someone explain the health bar having a red cection pls?
[0:33:59] <+mister_rogers> no complaints i promise lol
[0:34:02] <twin_triggers> it had the same engine as the dbz one. both of the games we never got in the states
[0:34:02] <%Klefth> They're not on the level of some SNK stages or SF3's, man
[0:34:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> YE
[0:34:18] <+mister_rogers> @BearSawed it's called the TOP bar. it's like a buff
[0:34:18] <%PinkieTheEerie> man that laggg
[0:34:18] <Emdhad> As long as i get to play as time fire/quantum rangers
[0:34:20] <megafangking> Rock looked so sad. :(

[0:34:22] <%Klefth> That beautiful pixel art

[0:34:24] <+dr_ddoooooom> FUCK YEAH
[0:34:28] <Fizzxwizz> you get a buff and access to a new move when your health is in the zone
[0:34:28] <digitaldenam> im sorry, what?
[0:34:29] <RoboXGP> persona 4 arena was dope it introduced context sensitive recovers
[0:34:30] <ExplosionForce> SEAFOOD FIGHTER
[0:34:32] <HotHungryHurricane> Reggie see my Tizoc.
[0:34:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> THE BEST VIRTUAL ON LIKE
[0:34:35] <+SuichiTanaka> The red section of the HP bar is the T.O.P. section. When your life is in that red part, you get access to a unique move.
[0:34:35] <BearSawed> @mister_rogers cool cool cool
[0:34:37] <townzzzzz> how about some dong dong?
[0:34:38] <+velgaduere> CRAB BATTLE
[0:34:38] <Daxalog> Is it War Is Shell?
[0:34:42] <ExplosionForce> GIVE ME THAT BUTTERED COMBOS
[0:34:43] <AggsMK7> You're under arrest. Believe IT
[0:34:44] <digitaldenam> neo what?
[0:34:44] <damiensiegfried> CRAB BATTLE
[0:34:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> so it's VIRTUAL-ON, BUT WITH CRABS AND BARNACLES
[0:34:47] <tacostarvedbeast> @woolieversus gleam of force?!?!?
[0:34:49] <+NarcissistCactus> neo yokio
[0:34:52] <+dr_ddoooooom> you guys ever going to play MK 3 on stream?
[0:34:56] <Emdhad> awww no dbfz
[0:34:56] <+mister_rogers> @BearSawed you can actually gain a little back by just defending
[0:35:00] <damiensiegfried> begone with that neo yokio shite
[0:35:01] <+PersonaQueen18> Can't wait for MK 11
[0:35:04] <megafangking> Crab People Arena
[0:35:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> KING OF CRUSTACEAN HYPE
[0:35:13] <+conqab> select = back button ?
[0:35:14] <TopLeftCenter> @BearSawed While your health is in that part of the bar you do more damage and everyone has their own move they can only do during that
[0:35:17] <Emdhad> Y'all should play MK10
[0:35:24] <+PersonaQueen18> It was good
[0:35:25] <Emdhad> MKX
[0:35:25] <+PersonaQueen18> I dug it
[0:35:32] <+PersonaQueen18> Could've used more dlc characters introduced.
[0:35:34] <+dr_ddoooooom> MK 3
[0:35:37] <+dr_ddoooooom> the only MK
[0:35:52] <+PersonaQueen18> Sad we never got a second set for Injustice 2.
[0:35:55] <Jaxnos> someone needs to make a good yuyu hakusho fighting game
[0:36:01] <%psychodave1234> @Bigbadwolf009 enjoy that shit my guy happy birthday Kappa
[0:36:05] <Emdhad> MKX ruined me by giving me khotal khan and now i have no interest in playing anyone else
[0:36:12] <%psychodave1234> also hi papa chewy
[0:36:13] <HanPaul> Grow Kreygasm
[0:36:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> there was a ps2 one that also came out on the arcades, but i dunno how good that one was
[0:36:16] <ExplosionForce> can you Kara into it?
[0:36:17] <gustavozxd> GET IN THE RING
[0:36:20] <chromdad> That guy can idle shuffle
[0:36:20] <+badjab326> select is the touch pad
[0:36:21] <+PersonaQueen18> I can't play Khotal to save my life lol
[0:36:24] <damiensiegfried> in dbz fighters, is there a DLC where you can fight Jiren as your create-a-character?
[0:36:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> also the genesis YYH fighter by treasure is GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
[0:36:25] <%Dungeon00X> If this is the PC version of GAROU, it's got some lag that everyone complained about. The 360 port is still flawless.
[0:36:27] <+Toynota10> I'd been hearing about frame delay on the steam and PS3 versions. Is it true or does that only happen online?
[0:36:31] <megafangking> My little cousins liked Garou when I showed it to them a ways back. :)
[0:36:46] <Emdhad> My little cousins loved tekken
[0:36:46] <%Dungeon00X> woolieSMUG
[0:36:51] <damiensiegfried> i want to see kermit fight Jiren
[0:36:53] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @drdoooomm Yeah, it was weird how they released 3 without releasing a 1 or 2 first.
[0:36:53] <Jaxnos> oh wait, there was a genesis one? by treasure?! well crap
[0:36:58] <Emdhad> got them off of Fortnite for a bit
[0:37:00] <blairINtheUSA> PowerUpL Squid3 PowerUpR
[0:37:11] <SciurusAlpha> a friend of mine wanted to get into fighting games after I told him and kinda lead him my copy of guilty gear.
[0:37:17] <+PersonaQueen18> Fortnite fighting game coming to a store near you
[0:37:24] <gustavozxd> the real bout games have some hilarious announcers
[0:37:24] <megafangking> @Emdhad Mine do to! XD
[0:37:35] <+dr_ddoooooom> @WaitHowDidIGetHere we don't talk about those numbers
[0:37:35] <+SuichiTanaka> SNK fighters rarely have normal links, like SF does
[0:37:42] <SciurusAlpha> His looking forward into buying Soul calibur 7
[0:37:47] <+Toynota10> How can I get my friends into fighting games when all they care about is Smash?
[0:37:47] <gustavozxd> "be careful or you'll be dead the guy" LUL
[0:37:58] <drez1210> SNK needs to make a sequel
[0:38:01] <+PersonaQueen18> Coax them into games that are between the two first
[0:38:01] <+NarcissistCactus> give them a bar of soap
[0:38:06] <megafangking> @PersonaQueen18 No LUL
[0:38:14] <damiensiegfried> what's between fighting games and smash?
[0:38:21] <+PersonaQueen18> Hmmm.
[0:38:28] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @drdoooomm NetherRealms is the anti-Valve.
[0:38:28] <+PersonaQueen18> Anime fighters
[0:38:28] <Jaxnos> force them to play playstation all stars
[0:38:37] <Emdhad> Honestly get them to play Tekken
[0:38:38] <RoboXGP> I found this game called Brutal : Paws of Fury on SNES
[0:38:39] <damiensiegfried> anime fighters hurt my soul
[0:38:51] <+PersonaQueen18> Like the BNHA or Ninja Storm games seem like a good next step
[0:38:58] <kaine_west> no crossover between the fanbases and the games, despite being lumped together
[0:39:00] <gustavozxd> oh no ninja storm
[0:39:00] <%jinking79> i hated kain so much
[0:39:03] <damiensiegfried> actually, naruto fighting games would be a good in between
[0:39:04] <drefizz> he looks like Urien
[0:39:04] <Emdhad> Directional inputs for different moves and wavedashing
[0:39:07] <megafangking> Mortal Kombat or Tekken
[0:39:07] <Jaxnos> and from playstation all stars go to that old jump game. and from there you can lean into an anime fighter
[0:39:14] <Jaxnos> j stars
[0:39:19] <+PersonaQueen18> Does anyone else miss the original Ultimate Ninja series before they went fully into Storm?
[0:39:20] <+Toynota10> I mean, DBFZ's pretty hype.
[0:39:23] <+SuichiTanaka> HURMM HMMM HRMMM
[0:39:24] <+GreatMonorail> @WoolieVersus Can everyone hear woolie well he sounds quiet to me
[0:39:30] <RoboXGP> Yu Yu Hakusho on the ps2 was made by Atari!
[0:39:36] <damiensiegfried> cool!
[0:39:37] <Emdhad> I had ultimate ninja 1 for the ps2
[0:39:40] <gustavozxd> I barely remember the old naruto games, i just don't like ninja storm
[0:39:42] <drefizz> DBFZ would be perfect it it had a push block
[0:39:48] <digitaldenam> @greatmonorail sounds good to me
[0:39:49] <TopLeftCenter> Voices are a touch quiet compared to game audio
[0:39:50] <Emdhad> and i remember doing the QTEs for the big attacks
[0:39:51] <drefizz> if*
[0:39:56] <%robobeau> I just joned the stream and OF COURSE he chose the Naruto colors
[0:39:58] <+PersonaQueen18> I am still heart broken we never got the 4th Ultimate Ninja.
[0:40:01] <megafangking> Yeah DBFZ is a good way to go for intro to fighting games!
[0:40:03] <gustavozxd> ninja storm 4 has a massive roster where everyone plays almost exactly the same LUL
[0:40:15] <getsmokedyo> Ultimate ninja 1-5 were THE shit
[0:40:16] <+NarcissistCactus> there was a 4th ultimate ninja
[0:40:19] <+PersonaQueen18> Not to mention besides the team ultimate moves most of them just aren't satisfying
[0:40:28] <Zineta> Dat crawl is great
[0:40:30] <Kristoffers> boom
[0:40:33] <+PersonaQueen18> Yeah there was but it wasn't localized in America, I don't think
[0:40:34] <drefizz> anyone else hype for the Jojo BR game?
[0:40:39] <cerazor01> What's the crawl do?
[0:40:39] <megafangking> Those Gamecube Naruto games though! PogChamp
[0:40:45] <NoWrench> Hi Woolie & chat!
[0:40:51] <getsmokedyo> only in Europe and Japan i think
[0:40:52] <Emdhad> Hello wrench
[0:40:54] <damiensiegfried> why is there a woolie exodia in the emotes?
[0:40:54] <RoboXGP> Jojo Battel Royal??
[0:41:00] <GetWicked> Every naruto game is trash
[0:41:01] <+PersonaQueen18> I also liked the old Budokai series before they went into Tenkaichi
[0:41:14] <megafangking> Sup Wrench! :D
[0:41:14] <Emdhad> Budokai 3 is still fun
[0:41:17] <drefizz> @aiyobro yeah theres a jojo br game coming out in japan, hopefully to console and pc one day
[0:41:20] <alloftheworld_1> What game is this? Nakoruru seems... Different somehow Kappa
[0:41:24] <+Toynota10> But then again, teams of three might be too much for some first timers.
[0:41:30] <NoWrench> @Emdhad scarfHi
[0:41:33] <blizzardinertia> @alloftheworld_1 Garou
[0:41:36] <+PersonaQueen18> Explosive punches....wow yeah this dude really is just Ralph
[0:41:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I see "Hotaru" on screen but where's Matt LUL
[0:41:43] <megafangking> Yup
[0:41:44] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> Pat and Woolie at once! it's like you guys knew I needed support XD
[0:41:47] <gustavozxd> if you want to learn the game, teams of 3 is way too much
[0:41:48] <damiensiegfried> a jojo battle royale sounds batshit insane, potentially
[0:41:53] <+radpuffin> capcomUltra capcomUltra capcomUltra capcomKO capcomKO
[0:41:55] <lazygreenjerk2> you get a fully charged punch
[0:42:02] <Emdhad> guilty gear is complicated but it makes up for it by having one of the best fighting games tutorial ever
[0:42:03] <rufus2k2> nice pucci colors there
[0:42:08] <+Toynota10> True
[0:42:10] <GetWicked> I'll say it now, every 3D "fighting game" that isn't tekken is a party game
[0:42:16] <+PersonaQueen18> And also one of the most confusing lore backstories lol
[0:42:26] <megafangking> Thats a claim!
[0:42:27] <gustavozxd> especially something like marvel, 3 characters and each with an assist so if you want to learn something you're gonna have to think about 6 different choices
[0:42:30] <alloftheworld_1> Virtua Fighter is totally a party game, I agree Keepo
[0:42:31] <cerazor01> I wonder if Woolie likes Guilty Gear
[0:42:32] <drefizz> I really hope the jojo br game does good in arcades so we can get a port
[0:42:33] <GetWicked> hot takes
[0:42:33] <gatorafan> Virtua Fighter tho
[0:42:36] <+NarcissistCactus> so dead or alive and virtua fighter are party games
[0:42:47] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @damiensiegfried “You thought you would be the winner of the victory royale, but it was I, Dio!”
[0:42:49] <+Toynota10> But people nowadays are only impressed by 3D graphics unless they have a desire to go and play stuff with sprites.
[0:42:49] <GetWicked> oh shit, virtua fighter is in there, too
[0:42:51] <alloftheworld_1> My favorite party game is Soul Caliber VI
[0:42:53] <Quikanims> @getwicked stop you'll awaken the virtua fighter fans
[0:42:55] <+PersonaQueen18> Saying party games like it's a bad thing
[0:43:04] <Zineta> Dat dmg PogChamp
[0:43:07] <Emdhad> Virtua fighter is NOT beginner friendly
[0:43:09] <megafangking> Dead or Alive is an Eroge game.LUL
[0:43:14] <megafangking> LUL
[0:43:17] <blizzardinertia> @emdhad agreed
[0:43:17] <GetWicked> i'm not saying it's a bad thing, i'm saying it isn't a fighting game
[0:43:18] <Quikanims> see?
[0:43:29] <Kristoffers> dead or alive 5 is too advanced for me
[0:43:32] <+NarcissistCactus> prove me wrong
[0:43:35] <kaine_west> lol dude, tekken has hard execution but VF is equally if not more challenging
[0:43:36] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> DoA is perfectly fine as a legit fightin game, the doofy titty physics aside
[0:43:36] <gustavozxd> dead or alive is an actually good ass fighting game
[0:43:38] <Kristoffers> haven't got the galaxy brain for those manouvers
[0:43:45] <blizzardinertia> @gustavozxd agreed
[0:43:46] <+Toynota10> When's Tekken x DOA
[0:43:50] <+Toynota10> never
[0:43:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh oh
[0:43:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think i get that
[0:44:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> he was doing feints alongside the AB cancel
[0:44:07] <+dr_ddoooooom> oohhh i'm learning
[0:44:09] <+SuichiTanaka> @WoolieVersus off of Ryan's crawl, you can get a low with A, or cancel it with C
[0:44:09] <blizzardinertia> @toynota10 sadly, it'll never happen
[0:44:14] <Emdhad> Mai is in DOA
[0:44:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> close normal, feint cancel, link into another close normal, then cancel into the low kick Break throw
[0:44:17] <drefizz> I could never get into soul calibur, DOA, or tekken, the fighting in them are too idk how to put it
[0:44:19] <Emdhad> Geese in Tekken
[0:44:24] <gustavozxd> tekken x doa would be cool but the actual beef between the devs might not let that happen LUL
[0:44:25] <kaine_west> tekken x Virtua fighter, I'd love that so much
[0:44:27] <+EightFootOctopus> iirc it's jab into light explosion knee thing repeatedly you can guard break
[0:44:30] <Emdhad> Tekken x Doa is a possibility
[0:44:30] <megafangking> I had fun with the DOA 6 demo. Felt legit!
[0:44:31] <+Toynota10> Yeah cause we all know Itagaki's 5 least favorite games lol
[0:44:34] <TopLeftCenter> I think Reggie is talking about taunt cancels, I think it's normals into A+C and directions
[0:44:41] <blizzardinertia> @kaine_west that'll never hapen
[0:44:41] <+PersonaQueen18> Fighting game crossovers are a rare breed at this point.
[0:44:51] <kaine_west> sadly true
[0:44:53] <+Toynota10> I know he's not working on DOA anymore but still
[0:44:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> forward or down + A+C for the feint moves
[0:45:02] <Emdhad> Tekken has been killing it though
[0:45:06] <alloftheworld_1> We got DoA characters in Koei games, when we gonna get Koei characters in DoA? Kappa
[0:45:06] <BearSawed> 3d fighters a more about movement than anything else so its a whole new layer on top of everything else I could never grasp
[0:45:08] <gustavozxd> oh he's not? I didn't know
[0:45:24] <+EightFootOctopus> his heavy explosion super is 0 frame lol
[0:45:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> @gustavozxd yeah itagaki's long detached from team ninja
[0:45:25] <kaine_west> I mean execution is also a fuck and combos to
[0:45:28] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @alloftheworld_1 Lu Bu just shows up in DoA one day
[0:45:44] <alloftheworld_1> @BigBlackSilvio PogChamp
[0:45:47] <gustavozxd> oh god yes 3d fighters get pretty crazy on movement
[0:45:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> Lube Bu
[0:45:58] <gatorafan> "Woolie makes a combo video"
[0:45:59] <+PersonaQueen18> What if Akuma just started cameoing in ALL fighting games with no explanation
[0:46:00] <%wolfofsound> Do not pursue
[0:46:14] <TopLeftCenter> Yeah, I don't know about this character but I know feint cancels are a pretty big deal for Terry
[0:46:15] <Emdhad> Akuma in Cross tag
[0:46:15] <gustavozxd> @bigblacksilvio pssh considering naotora li showed up in doa, the only dw character in doa would be wang yuanji LUL
[0:46:22] <megafangking> @BearSawed Its practice and experience. Most important thing is sidestepping
[0:46:22] <+PersonaQueen18> Akuma in Arcana Hearts
[0:46:24] <Emdhad> Akuma in Punch planet
[0:46:26] <%The_Timo> You cannot pursue Lube Bu
[0:46:30] <%wolfofsound> @PersonaQueen18 I'd love it, I fucking lost it when he just showed up in the tekken story
[0:46:33] <+dr_ddoooooom> that mask guy is super rad
[0:46:36] <Emdhad> Akuma Hearts Love max
[0:46:43] <+Toynota10> I woulda loved it if Anarchy Reigns had local multiplayer, but it don't...
[0:46:45] <kaine_west> Korean back dash tech and whiff punishing with movement too
[0:46:48] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Akuma in “Sonic the Fighters”
[0:46:48] <alloftheworld_1> That one revenge girl with the sais could work in DoA too, forget her name
[0:46:51] <gustavozxd> you have a million samurai warriors characters and they add the worst one to doa, goddamn Japan
[0:47:00] <+PersonaQueen18> Anarchy Reigns deserved to be a better game
[0:47:02] <+EightFootOctopus> can i link things or is a bot going to shoot me
[0:47:03] <+Deft_Thought> Asura in Punch Planet
[0:47:06] <+PersonaQueen18> With a soundtrack that went that hard
[0:47:14] <WanderingSwordsman> is that reggie?
[0:47:17] <ExplosionForce> Futaba with the best super ever
[0:47:17] <+PersonaQueen18> ye
[0:47:24] <BearSawed> @MegaFangKing23 ye, but I also always enjoyed 2d more so I put more time into them, so its so foreign haha
[0:47:24] <Kristoffers> an anarchy reigns that was 50% more god hand
[0:47:24] <alloftheworld_1> Fils-Aime? Kappa
[0:47:29] <Emdhad> It was a great game but not having local multiplayer was a braindead move
[0:47:33] <WanderingSwordsman> ah kickass
[0:47:45] <+Toynota10> I mean, maybe the game couldn't handle it
[0:47:52] <+PersonaQueen18> It still has one of the best damn relatively recent fighting game soundtrack alongside Killer Instinct
[0:47:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> the "THIS IS THE LOLICE" super lol
[0:47:55] <gustavozxd> oh man real bout games are so good
[0:48:00] <WanderingSwordsman> lets get fighterpedia started
[0:48:04] <+Toynota10> Or it would have detracted from the experience having 4 small screens
[0:48:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> for real, Real Bout 2 is highly enjoyable and highly recommended
[0:48:14] <+SuichiTanaka> her only command normal is d+B in air
[0:48:16] <%Klefth> Such a sick mask
[0:48:16] <+PersonaQueen18> No song makes me go harder than TJ Combo's theme
[0:48:25] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @guntanks_in_space I can’t tell if that’s a typo or not.
[0:48:34] <megafangking> @BearSawed Its all good! There's something pure about 2D fighters. I get it. :)
[0:48:38] <alloftheworld_1> Wan, Tsu, Wan, Tsu TehePelo
[0:48:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> @WaitHowDidIGetHere it's intentional lol
[0:48:40] <Emdhad> Ed's SFV theme is better than i thought it would be
[0:48:50] <Emdhad> But TJ combo is godlike
[0:48:54] <+PersonaQueen18> I haven't touched SFV tbh
[0:48:57] <+Deft_Thought> I'm all about that Zeku theme
[0:49:08] <+PersonaQueen18> I WILL admit that Rashid's theme is baller af tho
[0:49:09] <gustavozxd> oh yeah ed has a cool theme
[0:49:13] <%jinking79> that is a pain online
[0:49:22] <TopLeftCenter> SFV is in a real solid place these days, season 4 is looking fun
[0:49:23] <Emdhad> Rashidooooooo
[0:49:25] <blizzardinertia> I enjoy Lei Wulong's theme
[0:49:27] <+SuichiTanaka> There's short hops as well, so you can pressure with it better
[0:49:28] <gustavozxd> I love sfv's soundtrack, a lot of great songs in there
[0:49:29] <megafangking> @Emdhad True. TJ combo theme is so God tier!
[0:49:35] <+PersonaQueen18> BACK TO RISE
[0:49:42] <Emdhad> TRUTH BE TOLD
[0:49:47] <megafangking> PogChamp
[0:49:50] <+PersonaQueen18> Nothign gets me more hype
[0:49:53] <+Deft_Thought> @gustavozxd It's all around solid. Even tracks I wasn't a fan of I started liking in time.
[0:50:00] <kaine_west> labbing works
[0:50:15] <Emdhad> Man Maya's theme when the singing kings in Kreygasm
[0:50:15] <gatorafan> I love a lof of SFV's stage themes, makes me wish Capcom would let themselves do something original for the legacy characters instead of remixing old songs over and over.
[0:50:21] <BearSawed> Dude, this sort of thing is so therapeutic to me tho
[0:50:21] <Emdhad> kicks*
[0:50:26] <gustavozxd> meanwhile Woolie probably forgot he's even streaming LUL
[0:50:39] <%jinking79> this is Max in lad for 3-4 hours never once pulling what he learned
[0:50:45] <+PersonaQueen18> I think what mainly turned me off was the starting roster of SFV, the art style, and the cutdown from two ultra combos to one
[0:50:46] <Emdhad> Maya's theme forced me to main Maya in KI
[0:50:46] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus can you do it off of a short hop? Also the second hit probably whiffs if they're crouching
[0:50:51] <+dr_ddoooooom> I wonder if they will ever play gundam battle assult
[0:50:53] <+dr_ddoooooom> assault
[0:51:00] <gustavozxd> never forget 12 hour lab stream
[0:51:19] <alloftheworld_1> I wonder if Woolie will ever stream CVS... Card Fighters Kappa
[0:51:19] <Hoarseplay> @WoolieVersus Hotaru can gatling her air normals. She also has an air turn with C+D.
[0:51:20] <+Deft_Thought> Yeaaaah they don't really reach theme wise. Stage themes are always pretty varied though.
[0:51:29] <+Toynota10> Wonder if SNK will make a new fighting game series. What's the most recent IP they've started?
[0:51:46] <blizzardinertia> @toynota10 KOF XV
[0:51:57] <kaine_west> so do ya'll SF players in chat want a new SF or them to just make SFV actually good
[0:51:58] <Emdhad> Yeah XV is in development
[0:51:59] <gatorafan> Samurai Spirits VI is coming
[0:52:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> legit i don't even know about her air turn lol
[0:52:11] <gatorafan> Kinda weird we haven't gotten anything past the announcement
[0:52:12] <Emdhad> SFV is good tho
[0:52:15] <+Toynota10> No I meant its not a continuation of the series. A new series
[0:52:17] <Emdhad> its just not great
[0:52:18] <+Toynota10> Original
[0:52:27] <+PersonaQueen18> I liked SF4 tbh
[0:52:37] <Hoarseplay> I believe Hotaru and Gato are the only characters with air turn.
[0:52:49] <Emdhad> Sf4 juri is still best juri
[0:52:55] <+PersonaQueen18> oh absolutely
[0:52:56] <TopLeftCenter> I'm not done with SFV, but I would also welcome SF6 if that's what's coming
[0:53:05] <blizzardinertia> @personaqueen18 I have a lot of respect for third strike as of recent
[0:53:06] <gatorafan> And now to sound like a complete hypocrite after what I just said, I can't wait to hear SNK remix Genjuro's theme again doodBenny2
[0:53:09] <gustavozxd> samshoe time
[0:53:24] <+PersonaQueen18> Third Strike was before my time and I honestly never got much chance to play it
[0:53:28] <Emdhad> I would like to echo bafael
[0:53:40] <+PersonaQueen18> Most of my early fighting game experience came from the multi game KoF collection on PS2 haha
[0:53:44] <BearSawed> The thing that bothers me most in SFV is....WHY ISNT THE CHAR SELECT SCREEN IN A V PATTERN?
[0:53:51] <Emdhad> "there's nothing wrong with making fighting games easier, it's making them simpler that's the problem"
[0:53:52] <+PersonaQueen18> So I played a lot of KoF 2000 and 2001
[0:53:58] <+Toynota10> @WoolieVersus Yo we getting a live stream of the MK event on Thursday?
[0:54:01] <Quikanims> I just want Street Fighter 6: 4th Strike
[0:54:06] <Hoarseplay> @BearSawed It was in seasons 1.
[0:54:21] <+PersonaQueen18> Street Fighter 6: The Movie: The Game
[0:54:21] <+Toynota10> Ohhhhhhhhhhh shit
[0:54:24] <alloftheworld_1> PogChamp
[0:54:24] <+Dogfootjoe> HYPE
[0:54:25] <+SuichiTanaka> oooooooh
[0:54:28] <+mrboo001> PogChamp
[0:54:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> aww FUCK YEA
[0:54:30] <alexpandajoker> PogChamp
[0:54:31] <seylumiue> aw nice
[0:54:31] <+dr_ddoooooom> OOHHH SHIT
[0:54:31] <gatorafan> My arcade games were on a humble location so I could only play old fighters, never got to try third strike nor garou at the arcades and KOF2000 was a novelty
[0:54:31] <+phatmac16> WOW
[0:54:32] <+Toynota10> Yeeeeeeeeeeeeah!
[0:54:32] <Belutima> INVITE
[0:54:33] <+dr_ddoooooom> that's rad
[0:54:34] <+0ni0n_L0rd> WOOOOAH
[0:54:35] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeyeyeyeyeyeye
[0:54:35] <+Deft_Thought> I like SFV, I'm just frustrated by it. I don't that the V-Trigger system locks character flexibility behind a wall that some characters can build easy while others have to wait until they hit 2/3rds HP
[0:54:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> i was about to ask if you got invited or so
[0:54:38] <+NarcissistCactus> irl stream

[0:54:47] <Gutsandlove> NICE WOOLIE
[0:54:50] <%Klefth> @BearSawed It kinda lost that pattern as more characters were added
[0:54:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> Woolie gonna hang with Cody Rhodes and Shao Kahn Xavier Woods
[0:54:52] <HotHungryHurricane> fuck thats cool
[0:54:53] <+PersonaQueen18> OOOOOOHH

[0:54:59] <bootymane1017> NICE
[0:55:01] <Youknowwhyimhere008> cool
[0:55:03] <alloftheworld_1> Woolie got chosen as one of Earth's mightiest warriors PogChamp
[0:55:03] <+NarcissistCactus> fucking king of fighters invitation
[0:55:07] <+PersonaQueen18> FIRST BLOOD
[0:55:07] <+NarcissistCactus> bring your best gear
[0:55:09] <Quikanims> NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU
[0:55:11] <+Deft_Thought> I'm also mad torn cuz I like the aesthetic of SFV Cody but I HATE how Cody plays
[0:55:11] <+DesertOfSand> I really really really hope I like MK11
[0:55:12] <+Thetulev> noice
[0:55:12] <+SuichiTanaka> Say hi to Max and Kenny!
[0:55:14] <mrjohncarlton> Woolie: Champion of Earthrelm
[0:55:15] <SciurusAlpha> Woolie Vs Mortal Kombat 11
[0:55:18] <tacostarvedbeast> @woolieversus say hi to Kenny for me
[0:55:21] <SciurusAlpha> Woolie Vs EdBoon
[0:55:23] <+PersonaQueen18> @WoolieVersus Make sure to take many heads as trophies
[0:55:24] <+DesertOfSand> I wanted to like MKX so badly and BOY did I not
[0:55:24] <%Klefth> Oh yay, gratiutous shock value and shitty animation and choreography? :|
[0:55:25] <megafangking> Get those gloves ready!
[0:55:39] <HotHungryHurricane> shout outs to arthur
[0:55:40] <SciurusAlpha> WoolieVs Lobster
[0:55:42] <+DesertOfSand> I think I really just need mah boi Rain to come back
[0:55:46] <+PersonaQueen18> I thought MKX was an improvement over 9 tbh
[0:55:48] <+Epic_Skeptic> At least Ken
[0:55:54] <blizzardinertia> @personaqueen18 agreed
[0:56:01] <Emdhad> @desertofsand HE WAS IN THE STORY WHY ISN'T HE IN THE GAME
[0:56:01] <+Dogfootjoe> You going to california for it?
[0:56:02] <lorddeimos> Trump 2020!
[0:56:04] <$Clarke1010> why would you stream at the same time as patt
[0:56:04] <+PersonaQueen18> Plus it introduced my girl Cassie Cage <3
[0:56:06] <$Clarke1010> I cant do this
[0:56:10] <+DesertOfSand> Because Ed Boon hates me specifically
[0:56:13] <+Deft_Thought> Maybe MKXI model animations will look like actual humans moving 4Head
[0:56:14] <+DesertOfSand> This is the only plausible explanation
[0:56:16] <RoboXGP> injustice 2 was dope, too many specials though
[0:56:17] <Hoarseplay> Fun Fact: 214B and 214D have different properties. Use the B version for combos and use the D version for reflects and meter building.
[0:56:17] <%Solidus_113> Ahegao Academy video is now live on WoolieVersus Youtube
[0:56:25] <blizzardinertia> @clarke1010 why for?
[0:56:31] <+phatmac16> Cassie Cage is great
[0:56:37] <+spacehead5> What game would you guys suggest to someone who is incredibly interested in fighting games, and just as incredibly incompetent at them.
[0:56:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> coincidence you mention shock, Li Joe was also saying he was one of the best MK players ever
[0:56:44] <%Solidus_113> woolieGASM
[0:56:46] <+PersonaQueen18> Main her and Kitana from my older MK days
[0:56:48] <Fizzxwizz> dont do the stream deletion super
[0:56:49] <megafangking> I LOVE Cassie Cage!
[0:56:50] <@SoushinSen> I QA tested MKX for PS3 and Xbox 360 for months but it was sooooo bad that they eventually said fuck it we're cancelling those versions.
[0:56:54] <kaine_west> first off, 3D fg or 2D Fg?
[0:57:03] <+PersonaQueen18> Hella gay for Cassie Cage
[0:57:12] <Emdhad> I remember how disappointed my mate was because he only had a ps3
[0:57:14] <+hidef_sarge> @Guntanks_in_Space smash ultimate is pretty easy to get into
[0:57:24] <gustavozxd> I didn't care too much about the mkx kids tbh
[0:57:31] <blizzardinertia> @spacehead5 Tekken 7, Soul Calibur VI, Guilty Gear XRD REV2 and UNIEL
[0:57:32] <+hidef_sarge> though many people don't like to think about it as a fighting game
[0:57:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> smash ain't my thing, sadly
[0:57:33] <Emdhad> Takeda played cool
[0:57:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> but the belmonts being in it are super dope
[0:57:48] <Emdhad> Uniest is the one you should recommend
[0:57:51] <megafangking> She's gotta get a tattoo on her chest to continue her dad's legacy though. LUL
[0:57:51] <+hidef_sarge> the new soul calinur is real fun
[0:57:54] <+NarcissistCactus> play under night
[0:57:55] <+PersonaQueen18> I thought Jacqui was a good successor to Jax
[0:57:58] <RoboXGP> undernight was dope put like 20 hours in that, i put 20 hours in every fighting game
[0:58:03] <Emdhad> its the newer more complete version
[0:58:06] <+DesertOfSand> UNIST is easily my favorite fighting game, but that shit is not the game to hook people into the genre
[0:58:09] <gustavozxd> it was mostly their designs though
[0:58:14] <%keystone_yinzer> Skullgirls, always skullgirls
[0:58:17] <+SuichiTanaka> Links are SO limited in SNK games. It's generally not worth looking for them, IMO
[0:58:20] <bootymane1017> Mk11 will have 21 savage in it. Mark my words.
[0:58:21] <kaine_west> tekken/soul calibur for 3D of you're interested, easiest to learn hardest to master.
[0:58:22] <Emdhad> Skullgirls
[0:58:24] <+Johnsonunit> How do i Fightan gameU?
[0:58:26] <Emdhad> underrated
[0:58:28] <+PersonaQueen18> I still need to get SC6...but tight on funds...
[0:58:31] <+DesertOfSand> Skullgirls actually might be a great contender, if they dig the artstyle
[0:58:38] <+hidef_sarge> any arcsystemworks fighting game is a fun intro to 2d fighters
[0:58:40] <Hoarseplay> @WoolieVersus Fun Fact: 214B and 214D have different hitboxes and properties. Use the B version for combos and use the D version for reflects and meter buildin
[0:58:42] <gustavozxd> jaqui looks exactly like Cassie from far away..... just black LUL
[0:58:43] <kaine_west> I hate 21 savage's trap music, but a part of me would like it
[0:58:52] <RoboXGP> i wish cross tag battle was 3 rounds instead of 1
[0:58:53] <%Klefth> Skullgirls woolieGASM Man, if only they added the rest of the characters they had planned
[0:58:56] <Emdhad> YOUNG SAVAGE WHY YOU TRAPPIN SO HARF
[0:59:02] <TopLeftCenter> @You might be getting the hard version because of negative edge, that's really touchy in this game
[0:59:08] <+PersonaQueen18> Whatever happened to that studio's other game
[0:59:09] <TopLeftCenter> lol wow
[0:59:11] <+PersonaQueen18> Are they still making it?
[0:59:11] <megafangking> @PersonaQueen18 We feel ya on that one.
[0:59:22] <gatorafan> Indivisible is coming, I think this year isn't it?
[0:59:28] <+PersonaQueen18> Oh good
[0:59:30] <Emdhad> indivisible is on the ay
[0:59:30] <TopLeftCenter> I need some sleep
[0:59:32] <Emdhad> way

[1:00:49] <Doc1790> Hotaru is one of the funnest SNK characters imo
[1:00:49] <+NarcissistCactus> she channels her energy
[1:00:54] <+SuichiTanaka> She's just 'expressing energy'

[1:01:47] <Emdhad> @toynota10 whats the song for each?
[1:01:47] <%Adriangabs> Liam BibleThump
[1:01:52] <gustavozxd> any game that has an over the top Hitler is a 10/10 for me
[1:01:59] <+PersonaQueen18> Now I can't stop thinking of the idea of a LoL fighting game just cause I want Vi in a fighting game....
[1:02:03] <Hoarseplay> If you want to learn MotW, but bother Giby and he'll school you.
[1:02:09] <WanderingSwordsman> He's still on our backs and in our hearts

[1:02:50] <damiensiegfried> all sports are fun while playing it and legit feel like the anime versions
[1:02:51] <+PersonaQueen18> @MegaFangKing23 Hell yeah it does!

[1:04:13] <HotHungryHurricane> reggie smash OG.
[1:04:14] <RoboXGP> everyone should watch the "melee is broken" video
[1:04:37] <+PersonaQueen18> Well now i gotta look up Metal Revolution
[1:04:56] <megafangking> Metal Revolution looks pretty sick honestly.
[1:05:01] <gustavozxd> what is metal revolution
[1:05:07] <+NarcissistCactus> rising thunder but good
[1:05:12] <Emdhad> @damiensiegfried As a short dude i can only play running back but I WILL RUN MY ARSE OFF
[1:05:21] <+PersonaQueen18> Oh SHIT it's a robot fighting game
[1:05:23] <+gessho> Rising thunder
[1:05:26] <megafangking> A really cool looking, fast paced fighter.
[1:05:28] <+DesertOfSand> Metal Revolution is made by NEXT, which I believe is owned by Tencent, who bought Riot who bought Radiant
[1:05:29] <+gessho> 1 button auto correct dps
[1:05:33] <+Toynota10> Thats a first!
[1:05:38] <+DesertOfSand> So I wonder if it actually IS Rising Thunder 2.0
[1:05:50] <Emdhad> I would be too scared
[1:05:58] <Rexford2684> Rising Thunder was fine though?
[1:05:59] <GoldeNOVA> So what's the deal with Fighting games? Kappa
[1:06:03] <megafangking> Stand Up comedy is an art.
[1:06:04] <+PersonaQueen18> Stand up is great it's a shame it's not as televised anymore. All Netflix these days
[1:06:11] <kaine_west> yo woools how'd you get so jacked and lean?
[1:06:18] <blizzardinertia> @goldenova DOA6 and MK11 are coming soon.

[1:08:31] <gustavozxd> RANDY NO *SPLORGE*
[1:08:31] <Daxalog> Can someone explain what that weird colored part of the health bar is for?
[1:08:32] <$KnivesEve> oh no... yomi i guess

[1:08:52] <+Toynota10> @sparrrow_ PS4
[1:08:53] <%GohanEgret> @sparrrow_ ps4
[1:08:54] <Emdhad> @sparrrow_ PS4
[1:08:57] <+SuichiTanaka> Colored part of HP is TOP section. If HP is within it, you get access to a unique move.
[1:09:10] <TopLeftCenter> @Daxalog While your health is in that part you do extra damage and there's a certain move you can only do then
[1:09:12] <gustavozxd> back in my day we wrestled bears, kids these days don't know it
[1:09:19] <%timbob> woolie is playing with pad?
[1:09:21] <+PersonaQueen18> Is it just me or does that flip kick look familiar.....
[1:09:25] <Emdhad> You can also pick which part of your HP the TOP can be at
[1:09:32] <Marakami_Sadaneo> EY cirREE
[1:09:34] <Daxalog> Why not always set that part of the bar at the end?
[1:09:42] <mr_ESB> I thought woolie played stick?
[1:09:46] <haitakaa> this game had a crazy cancel mechanic too
[1:09:48] <TopLeftCenter> It also very slowly regenerates back to the top of the TOP section
[1:09:48] <Emdhad> that didn't work
[1:09:49] <+SuichiTanaka> Cause if you don't take any damage, you lose out on i t
[1:09:53] <Emdhad> it didn't combo
[1:09:53] <drefizz> Back in the day we use to sleep with the light off, kids these days dont know the struggle
[1:09:54] <Daxalog> OH
[1:09:55] <%GohanEgret> wtf they're making another ghostbusters movie
[1:09:57] <HexTone> Ayyy punch dad visitation hours start now. What's up ya'll?
[1:10:05] <+hidef_sarge> why does kevin have a gun meter
[1:10:05] <+PersonaQueen18> Sans Undertale for Smash Ult
[1:10:12] <kaine_west> Kevin is lame af, no wonder they memed on him back in the day
[1:10:18] <RoboXGP> chrono for ultimate
[1:10:19] <Hoarseplay> @hidef_sarge It's his win icon
[1:10:23] <haitakaa> Kevin is top tier
[1:10:23] <RoboXGP> or frog
[1:10:25] <Kristoffers> hahah
[1:10:27] <AggsMK7> Should have used his Naruto outfit
[1:10:28] <+hidef_sarge> oh i see now
[1:10:28] <megafangking> @GohanEgret Nooooo! :(
[1:10:34] <TopLeftCenter> If it's at the end they can potentially land a big combo and you get killed without ever getting a chance to take advatnage of it
[1:10:47] <damiensiegfried> @WoolieVersus would you ever think of doing Kotor 2 or the rest of the banner saga?
[1:10:49] <drefizz> Who existed first? Kevin or Nerdruto?
[1:10:52] <%GohanEgret> @MegaFangKing23 it's a sequel to the originals, not the new one
[1:11:08] <gustavozxd> oh so they're backing down like dmc LUK
[1:11:16] <gustavozxd> oh
[1:11:17] <+Toynota10> Not FFX-2 tho
[1:11:20] <TopLeftCenter> But if you have barely any health left having TOP at the end might save you from getting chipped out
[1:11:22] <haitakaa> you can also make the top section smaller or larger
[1:11:23] <AggsMK7> Artificial Academy confirmed
[1:11:24] <kaine_west> yo mass effect when
[1:11:28] <+PersonaQueen18> God Kotor One was one of my favorite of the later playthroughs I would LOVe to see the second
[1:11:32] <%GohanEgret> go back to blitzball Kappa
[1:11:32] <+leomuratore> Wooloe vs. Banner Saga 2? I'm down
[1:11:33] <+SuichiTanaka> Make them afraid of crawl, then cancel it instead of attacking out of it. Then throw.
[1:11:34] <TopLeftCenter> It's a neat little strategic thing to decide
[1:11:35] <+NarcissistCactus> can't wait for minecraft
[1:11:36] <%keystone_yinzer> I guess Woolie will just have to figure it out.
[1:11:45] <mr_ESB> How many fighting games have they gone through or has it been just garou for now?
[1:11:47] <blizzardinertia> @personaqueen18 what's motor?
[1:11:48] <thesickestzak> We gotta make it to the parking lot first Kappa

[1:14:30] <+leomuratore> @toynota10 The slow-mos in Injustic 2 are really cool. I love Noob Saibot's pose in MK9

[1:17:28] <RoboXGP> I can't beat gil in 3rd strike
[1:17:29] <AggsMK7> Third Strike, but I'd play CvS2 over it any day.
[1:17:29] <+TerryJ> absolutely Third Strike
[1:17:32] <+PersonaQueen18> Kevin gets an unspoken buff of extra damage against Butt.
[1:17:42] <+Toynota10> @PersonaQueen18 he does?
[1:17:45] <%GohanEgret> @damiensiegfried woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:17:47] <Orenjevel> !uptime
[1:17:50] <+kimonochrono> mechanically i like third strike better but cvs2 has more fanservice stuff i like
[1:17:57] <Emdhad> Yeaj Third Strike is the better game but I'd have more fun with CvS2
[1:17:58] <+kimonochrono> so hard choice
[1:17:59] <+PersonaQueen18> @Toynota10 oh my GOD no I was making a bad joke
[1:18:05] <+TerryJ> how do yall feel about the hampster ports of KoF
[1:18:06] <Emdhad> MvC2 over all of them though
[1:18:14] <+PersonaQueen18> Sometimes I saw dumb stuff lol
[1:18:16] <+clack14> aiyobro I just do cr.mk into tatsu then hit confirm cr.mk into his super. it took a bit of work
[1:18:21] <+clack14> with ken
[1:18:29] <+Toynota10> I went to my first con this weekend and someone dressed up as Q was kicking ass in 3rd Strike lol
[1:18:30] <+PersonaQueen18> MvC2 was good. And so was 3.
[1:18:35] <+PersonaQueen18> And then....they sold out.
[1:18:43] <+TerryJ> for some reason kensou is my best character
[1:18:44] <Emdhad> Listen
[1:18:48] <Emdhad> Queen
[1:18:55] <+PersonaQueen18> Well maybe sold out isnt the right word
[1:18:55] <blizzardinertia> @emdhad I've only played MVC3 & UMVC3. MVC2 was before my time.
[1:19:03] <Man_in_the_Red> @personaqueen18 its less that and they didnt buy in
[1:19:09] <Emdhad> MvCi is the best feeling game out of all of them
[1:19:10] <+clack14> it's hard to get ahold of now a days
[1:19:21] <+KyroDragon> YOOO GGAROU IS SICK
[1:19:21] <Emdhad> but i can't play that game for more than half an hour
[1:19:22] <didgereedoodah> they didn't sell out hard enough
[1:19:25] <+PersonaQueen18> Oof
[1:19:28] <+PersonaQueen18> That says a lot
[1:19:33] <+TerryJ> could they recover infinite with a new edition?
[1:19:36] <gatorafan> It took me until a few weeks ago to realize the grooves on CvS2 are named CAP and SNK doodStare
[1:19:37] <gustavozxd> at least it wasn't PlayStation all star, the whole game is just a massive AD
[1:19:43] <+PersonaQueen18> possibly but it'd take a much more expanded roster
[1:19:44] <AggsMK7> Pass the CHIPS
[1:19:44] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus short hop normals can be special cancelled out of landing recovery. no time to confirm though, gotta commit
[1:19:46] <+SuichiTanaka> @WoolieVersus You can cancel Kevin's crawl with C/ hard punch
[1:19:53] <+kimonochrono> need some dip for that chip
[1:19:57] <%GohanEgret> @TerryJ not unless it's a massive overhaul, and even then you might as well just do a new game altogether
[1:19:57] <Emdhad> I'd need better visuals
[1:19:59] <+Toynota10> Definitely best win quote goes to Yamcha when he beats Android 18 and says "What do you even see in this woman, Krillin?"
[1:20:00] <RoboXGP> anyone like tatsunoku vs capcom?
[1:20:10] <+kimonochrono> tvc is fun
[1:20:10] <Emdhad> Yes
[1:20:11] <+PersonaQueen18> Yeah the visuals were....also not super good lol
[1:20:13] <gustavozxd> tvc is cool
[1:20:15] <+clack14> yeah people like tvc
[1:20:18] <blizzardinertia> @aiyobro Never played it
[1:20:28] <Emdhad> Karas and Tekkaman blade were my go to
[1:20:30] <topendbuzza> yes I know what these words mean...
[1:20:31] <+SuichiTanaka> DIRTEH
[1:20:34] <+Toynota10> Its always looked cool
[1:20:36] <+NarcissistCactus> real fighting game begin
[1:20:37] <RoboXGP> it's pretty simple only two attack buttons and a special and a break
[1:20:38] <damiensiegfried> for the record, i just realized that it was pat's playthrough of banner saga that was on youtube. woolie was just super active in it and much more memorable
[1:20:38] <+PersonaQueen18> I didn't play TvC if only because I recognized almost none of the Tatsunoko characters lol
[1:20:41] <haitakaa> so many great stages in Garou
[1:20:44] <+Deft_Thought> Revealing that Crawl Tech
[1:20:46] <+TerryJ> i think if they add all of the missing xmen/fantastic 4 plus some good capcom picks and balance sfuff could bring people back
[1:20:51] <+Deft_Thought> I miss old fighting game stages
[1:20:52] <+Toynota10> Listened to that opening song a few times
[1:21:01] <+SuichiTanaka> Kevin's got many ways in around fireballs.
[1:21:03] <+Toynota10> Yo when's mugen?
[1:21:03] <+TerryJ> alex was dirty af in TvC
[1:21:07] <RoboXGP> cashern sins is in tatsunok vs capcom
[1:21:11] <haitakaa> is that the fat guy from KOF?
[1:21:12] <+kimonochrono> its funny that its a crossover game but all i ever did in tvc was ryu/batsu
[1:21:15] <+Deft_Thought> SFV has some good ones but none of them feel as lively or dynamic as these packed streets
[1:21:20] <gustavozxd> I STILL don't know what tatsunoko is but i still enjoyed tvc
[1:21:22] <+kimonochrono> just felt fun to me
[1:21:24] <Emdhad> wasn't stun gun super broken in TvC terry?
[1:21:36] <+clack14> Deft_Thought also a real problem is stages that lag
[1:21:42] <+Deft_Thought> For sure
[1:21:53] <+PersonaQueen18> @gustavozxd it made lots of early anime and stuff
[1:21:58] <+TerryJ> supers were super free and you could tag super so stungun was great
[1:22:05] <gustavozxd> the airplane in sfv NotLikeThis
[1:22:10] <+Toynota10> I remember I tried to watch Karas cause of TvC but it was too fast for my child eyes to watch
[1:22:11] <+Deft_Thought> I accept that you can't have packed, complicated stages if you want stages to run well
[1:22:15] <+ssamjangg> Who's the friend?
[1:22:17] <+SuichiTanaka> The pure joy of people realizing character potential.
[1:22:19] <+PersonaQueen18> Reggie
[1:22:20] <+Deft_Thought> but I'm a consumer and I want it REEEEEEEE
[1:22:21] <AggsMK7> It's Reggie
[1:22:26] <haitakaa> the stages also change during rounds
[1:22:26] <+PersonaQueen18> From his Naruto series if you watched that
[1:22:26] <gatorafan> So, does Woolie know he ended up picking the top tier character again? doodBenny2
[1:22:27] <+clack14> gustavozxd I can't watch people play on it, but if I play on it I don't mind. I don't understand that stage.
[1:22:36] <AggsMK7> He's from PORN and Katamari
[1:22:40] <Hoarseplay> Did anyone tell these scrubs about feints yet?
[1:22:41] <+TerryJ> space with hits theme is a favorite of mine in FighterZ
[1:22:44] <Emdhad> Why did capcom give my boy rashid the airplane though
[1:22:44] <+ssamjangg> PORN eh
[1:22:48] <+clack14> gatorafan whoops accidently boss char Kappa
[1:22:49] <%GohanEgret> oh man when's more Popoff Report News
[1:22:53] <gustavozxd> the joy of playing videogames, quite rare these days
[1:22:53] <+kimonochrono> theyve been doing feints
[1:23:01] <+clack14> GohanEgret with the real questions
[1:23:03] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[1:23:05] <+Deft_Thought> Kevin's no slouch in this game, man
[1:23:07] <+PersonaQueen18> CRAWL THROUGH THE HADOKENS
[1:23:08] <kaine_west> man that's some dirty ass tech
[1:23:11] <+pr0at> atpRtsd4
[1:23:20] <satans_finest_millennial> how long has the stream been on?
[1:23:20] <+SuichiTanaka> IIRC, Kevin is one of the best chars
[1:23:21] <+TerryJ> Rock V Terry is such a good match in this game
[1:23:26] <Emdhad> Kevin fucking Rian
[1:23:30] <%GohanEgret> @satans_finest_millennial 90 minutes
[1:23:43] <satans_finest_millennial> thanks gohan
[1:23:45] <spiegspikel> Shit. I’m late. Who’s playing as who?
[1:23:47] <Emdhad> @satans_finest_millennial about an hour and a half
[1:23:47] <+TerryJ> also the Blank X Blank format didnt age well for this gamr
[1:23:49] <+PersonaQueen18> For anyone who asked, Woolie knew exactly what he was doing trying to learn Kevin
[1:23:53] <+kimonochrono> oof
[1:23:54] <RoboXGP> yatterman in tvc was my favorite had a robot fire truck/dog for a special
[1:23:56] <+TerryJ> *game
[1:24:00] <AggsMK7> Woolie is Cop Naruto and Reggie is Hotaru
[1:24:08] <haitakaa> Pirate Girl has a special super where she takes off her shoe and beats you with it LUL
[1:24:09] <+clack14> woolie is a cop
[1:24:12] <spiegspikel> Gotcha. Thanks
[1:24:13] <+PersonaQueen18> COP NARUTO. BELIEVE IT, PUNKS
[1:24:18] <damiensiegfried> he's going to burn your face off then put his face where yours used to be and frame you for murder
[1:24:30] <%GohanEgret> popo naruto
[1:24:30] <+ssamjangg> This music is too peaceful for a fighting game
[1:24:32] <Emdhad> RASEN GUN
[1:24:33] <+kimonochrono> dattebayou're under arrest
[1:24:34] <kaine_west> ahh man that crawling shit is insane
[1:24:35] <+TerryJ> i bet woolie would be a cop if they gave him a jetpack
[1:24:38] <AggsMK7> That is my POLICDO
[1:24:40] <+hidef_sarge> I'M GONNA BE THE NEXT SHERIFF
[1:24:41] <+PersonaQueen18> I'm fucking dying
[1:24:44] <+PersonaQueen18> Rasen gun killed me
[1:24:45] <+ThePuddingDead> YO! Fightin games THO
[1:24:47] <+PersonaQueen18> I'm so done
[1:24:55] <damiensiegfried> why would anyone be a cop if they had a jetpack??
[1:25:03] <+PersonaQueen18> Imagine if Naruto just pulled out a fucking gun and blew his enemy away
[1:25:04] <+clack14> to shoot bullets higher bro
[1:25:10] <+NarcissistCactus> free money
[1:25:14] <+NarcissistCactus> criminals can't do shit
[1:25:15] <Emdhad> Isn't that what boruto is about?
[1:25:17] <damiensiegfried> but sky crime tho
[1:25:19] <+SuichiTanaka> Gonna be the next hocopge
[1:25:20] <Emdhad> Justu guns?
[1:25:24] <+kimonochrono> hidden gun jutsu
[1:25:24] <Daxalog> 000000000000000.
[1:25:24] <+PersonaQueen18> WHAT
[1:25:27] <%jinking79> was this guy trained by Heidern
[1:25:30] <+clack14> PersonaQueen18 you were caught in my genjitsu all along 👁
[1:25:34] <+TerryJ> finally a hard counter to sky crime
[1:25:40] <PhantomMaskJr> shotoHado wwtvMIS
[1:25:52] <+PersonaQueen18> @clack14 too bad you're genjutsu activated my trap card! Am...am I doing this right
[1:25:55] <damiensiegfried> kagebushin no jutsu! >all clones pull out a gun, and one pulls out a bat<
[1:26:07] <AggsMK7> Bail Release Jutsu
[1:26:13] <%ChoculaUltra> ...Bryan Fury?!
[1:26:14] <+Deft_Thought> Straight up, I think I'd like SFV if damage values were as high as they were then the game was first being tested
[1:26:17] <%ShockzNDrawe> woolieREMEMBERS woolieVS woolieCHAN
[1:26:20] <+PersonaQueen18> Police Brutality No Jutsu
[1:26:31] <Emdhad> Sasuke as a cop has a taser instead of chidori
[1:26:32] <+TerryJ> if we just release a bunch of rouge cops into the sky we can really clean up this sky crime
[1:26:43] <%mistspade> @jinking79 pretty sure he's just blue mary relative.
[1:26:45] <damiensiegfried> rouge cops?
[1:26:45] <PhiZeroOne> I think I'd like SFV if it wasn't an absurd moneysink
[1:26:55] <+Toynota10> How did Max get so fans to watch his streams? Is it because he put himself out there a lot?
[1:26:57] <+PersonaQueen18> Sasuke's not a cop, Sasuke's the dumb rich white kid who wears a fuck cops shirt while shoplifting
[1:26:59] <+TerryJ> yeah the action movie type
[1:27:02] <AggsMK7> Jiraiya was kicked off the force by HR
[1:27:07] <RoboXGP> i played sfv for a day and was done lol
[1:27:07] <damiensiegfried> so cops with weirdly attractive succubus forms?
[1:27:10] <gatorafan> Benny doodBenny
[1:27:10] <+hidef_sarge> i think i'd like SFV if were actually Tekken 7
[1:27:12] <Emdhad> @toynota10 he's been doing it for years
[1:27:14] <+SuichiTanaka> Max built his watcher numbers up slowly over time.
[1:27:19] <didgereedoodah> Itachi wanted for shooting up his whole block
[1:27:35] <haitakaa> damn Reggie is really good at those anti air DPs
[1:27:38] <+TerryJ> like we might have to sacrifice some older cops that are a week from retirement but it will be worth it
[1:27:41] <+SuichiTanaka> He runs a really fun, active stream, talks to his chat a lot, and is generally positive without getting too salt
[1:27:57] <spiegspikel> I’m told netcode for this game isn’t very good. Can anybody confirm or deny this?
[1:28:11] <Emdhad> It's bad
[1:28:17] <Hoarseplay> Netcode is indeed ass.
[1:28:19] <spiegspikel> Damn.
[1:28:19] <+PersonaQueen18> there's some input lag or something yeah
[1:28:25] <Emdhad> straight buttcheeks
[1:28:28] <haitakaa> no one is ever online anyways
[1:28:33] <$AliveInside191> Fightcade is your best bet
[1:28:35] <AggsMK7> Always with the grab whiffs
[1:28:36] <Hoarseplay> It's a good port for offline play, but that's about it.
[1:28:38] <haitakaa> but it largely depends on ping
[1:28:54] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> what're the gameplans for tonight?
[1:28:54] <+Toynota10> Thats part of the reason I got the Switch version. Does it run the best on current gen consoles? Or is the Xbone version superior?
[1:28:57] <TopLeftCenter> It's input delay and with so few people out there the chance of getting an acceptable connection is actually harder than finding someone to play with irl
[1:28:59] <spiegspikel> Right. I play it on fightcade. I just think my PS4 would be more convenient
[1:29:01] <+PersonaQueen18> Now Kevin looks like he belongs in TF2....
[1:29:03] <haitakaa> better off with fightcade or steam version
[1:29:15] <+PersonaQueen18> PROTECT THE BRIEFCASE
[1:29:19] <%Menitta> Damn, he does
[1:29:22] <+kimonochrono> isnt steam version of garou trash
[1:29:27] <Emdhad> Kevin looks like sfv ken now
[1:29:28] <+kimonochrono> ?
[1:29:31] <+NarcissistCactus> big brain
[1:29:32] <+Deft_Thought> Oniiii-chaaaaaan
[1:29:33] <+fatbootygoblin> evo17Charge
[1:29:36] <+PersonaQueen18> Talk about an explosive victory
[1:29:37] <PhantomMaskJr> I never understand what Kevin’s fighting style was supposed to be
[1:29:40] <kaine_west> reggie caught pressing buttons
[1:29:45] <DesertPenguin> Hey Woolie who's your friend?
[1:29:46] <+PersonaQueen18> @PhantomMaskJr Ralf but not Ralf
[1:29:47] <+kimonochrono> police brutality style
[1:29:50] <+TerryJ> TF2 is just the prequel to KoF
[1:29:59] <%jinking79> lets go
[1:30:01] <spiegspikel> Kevin’s fighting style is dirty cop
[1:30:04] <AggsMK7> And the five people who play this can jump in.
[1:30:07] <+PersonaQueen18> SHOUTOF EARTH
[1:30:07] <Emdhad> Is TF2 a dream match?
[1:30:11] <+SuichiTanaka> Kevin's fight style is the same 'military strong style' that SNK chars usually have
[1:30:14] <damiensiegfried> isn't police brutality style Naruto's clone jutsu?
[1:30:23] <RoboXGP> Butt
[1:30:24] <+PersonaQueen18> OH SNAP
[1:30:27] <DesertPenguin> Oh hey Reggie!
[1:30:27] <%GohanEgret> kevin butt

[1:31:11] <Hoarseplay> @TerryJ Marco Rodriguez
[1:31:12] <CampinSteve> yo this spritework is godlike
[1:31:25] <+Deft_Thought> He's Brazilian
[1:31:28] <AggsMK7> Butt's too MUCH

[1:31:38] <spiegspikel> SNK’s Third Strike, my man.
[1:31:45] <didgereedoodah> so much random stuff in the back
[1:31:46] <%TerryJ> yeah sprites were always snk's bif advsntage
[1:31:47] <kaine_west> but owns, those fast fireballs are dope
[1:31:49] <+kimonochrono> this is better than third strike imo
[1:31:51] <Hoarseplay> @didgereedoodah Brazil
[1:31:58] <Emdhad> It took capcom three tries to make third strike
[1:32:00] <AggsMK7> Right through top
[1:32:04] <Mendin> A Butt-stomping
[1:32:04] <Doc1790> That did a lot

[1:32:26] <Mendin> That level 3 is a triple qcf, it's a pain
[1:32:28] <+kimonochrono> yeah 3s has a much better ost
[1:32:31] <+mourning_lemon> send kushnoods
[1:32:33] <spiegspikel> I put them on par with each other, with this being slightly more gorgeous than 3rd Strike, animation-wise.
[1:32:34] <+PersonaQueen18> Instead of pounding Butt....the Butt pounded you....
[1:32:36] <+kimonochrono> but this ost is still good
[1:32:41] <+Toynota10> Is it true this game has the worst version of Rock?
[1:32:46] <+kimonochrono> yep
[1:32:50] <Emdhad> Sadly yes
[1:32:51] <SwindlerOfProgress> KhushNood
[1:32:55] <+kimonochrono> rock is ass in this game. i mean hes fun but hes ass
[1:32:55] <+PersonaQueen18> He's taunting you!
[1:32:57] <+Deft_Thought> Best Terry though
[1:33:00] <Emdhad> He's low tier
[1:33:01] <kaine_west> 3 qcf doesnt sound too bad on pad
[1:33:10] <SwindlerOfProgress> Stop trying to make the name make more sense, Woolie.
[1:33:13] <Man_in_the_Red> when is rock not low tier
[1:33:14] <gatorafan> I wouldn't say worst version, but more like Rock most of the time is in the low end of the tier lists
[1:33:14] <%TerryJ> jacket terry is so good
[1:33:16] <+Toynota10> I tried playing him and was wondering why something felt off...
[1:33:20] <SerRule1> What Fisticuff games are you guys sad will never happen?
[1:33:21] <+kimonochrono> in every other game hes in lol
[1:33:32] <PhantomMaskJr> Fatal Fury games never really had a really good ost

[1:44:01] <Quikanims> my fav is Sub Zero with Spiderman right behind that
[1:44:03] <%Menitta> I'll lose
[1:44:12] <megafangking> Terry is my favorite Fatal Fury character though!
[1:44:14] <AggsMK7> Ike
[1:44:16] <RoboXGP> he said samus
[1:44:18] <+Parrish_broadnax> Samus
[1:44:18] <+Shady_Zaku> I wish they weren't streaming at the same time

[1:44:21] <+SuichiTanaka> I really hope we'll get Skullgirls one of these Tuesdays.

[1:44:22] <+PersonaQueen18> SAMUS IS QUEEN
[1:44:22] <cordhine> oh thanks.

[1:44:25] <Emdhad> IKE CREW
[1:44:25] <%reknownblackcat> @woolieversus been a big fan for a bit now! glad to finally catch you stream!
[1:44:26] <primaryfire> who's the favourite character
[1:44:30] <$KnivesEve> probably samus
[1:44:30] <Zayasu> its not kirby? o_O
[1:44:32] <+conqab> his fav must be lil mac
[1:44:35] <vriskybusiness8> roy and roy
[1:44:36] <+Deft_Thought> I was hyped for Cody in SFV until I played him :(
[1:44:38] <%ChoculaUltra> KIKBAK
[1:44:41] <+Parrish_broadnax> Samus was the main but Not sure who the fave is
[1:44:44] <+Parrish_broadnax> Kirby
[1:44:46] <+kimonochrono> my main in ultimate is samus but my favorite to play is ganondorf
[1:44:47] <+NarcissistCactus> are you ok :)
[1:44:48] <+Parrish_broadnax> Nevermind it has to be Kirby
[1:44:55] <+PersonaQueen18> Cody's so disappointing in SFV cause they like....took away what made him him
[1:44:55] <Gurbetsjov> BURNING
[1:44:57] <Emdhad> I was hyped until they changed Turn the Beat Back
[1:45:05] <topendbuzza> his fav must be kirby
[1:45:05] <+Raginroxas> ARe YOu oK?
[1:45:06] <+PersonaQueen18> Him being clean cut and out ofc uffs just isn't impressive
[1:45:23] <+kimonochrono> KEEK BACK

[1:45:46] <+Deft_Thought> I love Cody's design in V
[1:45:51] <+Deft_Thought> I just don't like how he plays
[1:45:52] <%GohanEgret> as someone with no attachment to Cody or that universe, Codell Traverson is a swag master
[1:45:54] <%TerryJ> i cant wait until kirby gets a gun
[1:46:03] <+Deft_Thought> He isn't a counterhit character anymore and that's a bummer for me
[1:46:10] <vriskybusiness8> You only like this Terry cause he looks like Ken+Alex. change my mind
[1:46:11] <+PersonaQueen18> Kirby has several guns doesn't he?
[1:46:18] <zaelelzurias> @TerryJ just swallow fox or falco
[1:46:26] <+Parrish_broadnax> Or bayo
[1:46:27] <%ChoculaUltra> man, that is some bad font. I honestly cannot tell the difference between the T and Y in Terry.
[1:46:27] <Emdhad> Wrong this Terry is cool because of the coat
[1:46:28] <cordhine> or wolf
[1:46:29] <AggsMK7> I wish Codell had a better looking CA
[1:46:31] <%AliveInside191> 13 Terry is the best looking Terry
[1:46:34] <AceOne5> show them your rising takleu

[2:30:53] <ThisRebelLion> I like Cid a lot, but when I see people use her, I don't see too much. wonder if that grenade arc can be changed or slowed.
[2:31:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What if there was a Pizza Boy as a joke character?
[2:31:04] <Strtfghtr88> willsimplybe she's got some sick setups

[2:31:28] <Strtfghtr88> funny thing is, she's top tier
[2:31:32] <ThisRebelLion> @Strtfghtr88 a 3/6?
[2:31:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> All six characters so far are ON POINT
[2:31:41] <Strtfghtr88> the 3rd most technical in the game
[2:31:42] <%PunchPlanetGame> cid is fierce
[2:31:44] <Parapattern> Roy is JUST Bruce Willis
[2:31:46] <Rexford2684> Cid is awesome.
[2:31:55] <megafangking> Killer Croc?
[2:31:57] <+noodlebaka> yooooo
[2:32:01] <Strtfghtr88> I would say dog is 1st most technical followed by Agent
[2:32:03] <Rexford2684> Maxx is a frog.
[2:32:04] <rsg220> Is Roy still busted in this?
[2:32:04] <%PunchPlanetGame> Roy is the main character
[2:32:16] <CommanderCOOL> Cid just takes a different kinda set play. she SO much fun when you get her down.
[2:32:18] <+VektorTroika> Dodoria is here
[2:32:25] <ThisRebelLion> ah. Yeah, I felt there had to be some stuff with her. just didn't quite know what. And watched her get obliterated by Roy with the power of GUN.
[2:32:29] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Maxx looks like he's from Osmosis Jones
[2:32:34] <megafangking> My bad. ;P
[2:32:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I don't know how the locked 2 characters can be just as good but I'm excited to be wrong

[2:47:47] <+skylerpilot> Hey guys i have a problem with Punch Planet where when im on the menu the option I have selected is constantly cycling down like I have down held on my controller and I havn't been able to fix it. It happens regardless if my controller or keyboard are plugged in and only happens with the menus. It doesn't happen in game or at character select. Has anyone else dealt with this?
[2:47:52] <+Jayschroo> holy shit this game is SMOOTH
[2:47:54] <PP_Willpower> LUL

[2:48:14] <+VektorTroika> @supaXmugen is that what Agent-G's accent is?
[2:48:14] <@akuda_bar> @skylerpilot probably better off asking reddit or the steam group or something
[2:48:22] <+nharliecash> i've noticed the characters are so tall they don't actually jump very high

[2:48:31] <+nharliecash> doesnt take much to reach the top of the screen
[2:48:35] <Bamcc2> !uptime
[2:48:43] <+Lord0Mugen> @VektorTroika wouldnt surprise me
[2:48:49] <%PunchPlanetGame> @skylerpilot you might have held down on a controller when you launched the game. If that does not help check your steam controller settings under preferences in the main steam menu
[2:48:53] <heckengine> !updog

[3:16:15] <+spikebomb5> eilleen crippley
[3:16:19] <Vyctorian> I loved the NUNS2 play through, made me realize just how much gets left out the qte's were still dope though

[3:16:31] <%Commander_Deko> THICC
[3:16:40] <Daxalog> Im noticing some of the voice clips are playing doubled at the same time. I mean it is cool.
[3:16:43] <Strtfghtr88> the two baddest women in fighting game history
[3:16:48] <Strtfghtr88> Kreygasm
[3:16:52] <+nharliecash> shes honestly more like vasquez, but neither her or ripley ever had a cool knife
[3:17:01] <ThisRebelLion> yeah, she's more of a vasquez
[3:17:04] <Vyctorian> Cid is <3
[3:17:07] <Strtfghtr88> ^
[3:17:11] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> hey what did I miss?
[3:17:14] <CptBritches> I just see female Rambo
[3:17:16] <Strtfghtr88> cid has my favorite voice acting
[3:17:22] <alloftheworld_1> I see the Vasquez, too - just needs a pulse rifle
[3:17:22] <+Cigwynn> I know right? I'm like 99% certain their 3D models, but part of my brain wants to believe they're not so I can be even more impressed
[3:17:30] <%PunchPlanetGame> haha
[3:17:33] <Vyctorian> I just realized there's face cam in the corner lol
[3:17:34] <%Solidus_113> @DRAGUN_Xrd you missed devs dunking on Woolie and Reggie
[3:17:46] <PP_Willpower> nice
[3:17:49] <%PunchPlanetGame> @Cigwynn its 3d models
[3:17:52] <Strtfghtr88> Cid's voice actor also voices Tristana for League of Legends
[3:17:59] <Daxalog> I think their def 3d models. Especially when you see them move back and forth rapidly
[3:18:11] <Strtfghtr88> they are 3d models
[3:18:26] <majindusto> Sucks that Vasquez only got to be in one movie BibleThump
[3:18:29] <+spikebomb5> thats what ppl gotta realize, u can make shit work if it's highly stylized
[3:18:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> they are 3d, as mentioned by the devs when they were watching LJB play this lol
[3:18:35] <%Commander_Deko> ride the lightning
[3:18:41] <%linkwolf4> these two characters radiate the largest fem-dom energy in a fighting game. seconded by Juri MAYBE coxWaifu

[3:18:43] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> damn
[3:18:46] <%PunchPlanetGame> you guys can watch me animate the 3d stuff on our twitch channel too
[3:18:51] <powerprotoman> they wernt jsut dunks they were full court dunks from the court on the other side of the city
[3:18:52] <PP_Willpower> ivy?
[3:18:52] <+Cigwynn> yeah. Like I said though, I JUST wanna B E L I E V E
[3:19:01] <salty_noodles_> Yara looks like a Wonder Woman Star Platinum
[3:19:13] <PP_Willpower> nice block
[3:19:16] <Nat20_Gaming> @WoolieVersus So I am working on making a game and was wondering which do you think is more important a dodge or parry mechanic in a character action game?
[3:19:16] <Strtfghtr88> ^
[3:19:17] <%linkwolf4> @PP_Willpower shit you right
[3:19:25] <+VektorTroika> @salty_noodles_ oraoraora except it's SNUSNUSNUSNUS
[3:19:31] <+spikebomb5> more like 80s wondy shulk
[3:19:38] <+nharliecash> @Nat20_Gaming the option to do either
[3:19:38] <%Solidus_113> also forgetting Poison
[3:19:41] <majindusto> Yara looks like She-Hulk
[3:19:43] <ThisRebelLion> is cid motions or charge?
[3:19:45] <+Cigwynn> Tyara does, I hadn't noticed! sbfpSOB
[3:19:50] <Strtfghtr88> damn these cid confirms
[3:19:53] <Youknowwhyimhere008> 1-1
[3:19:57] <Parapattern> Tyara definitely has that Warrior Princess of Mars feel from Pulp Scifi
[3:20:00] <Nat20_Gaming> @nharliecash I'd love to but this is my first game with the Unreal Egine
[3:20:01] <%linkwolf4> FUCK STOP CALLING ME OUT GUYS
[3:20:03] <Nat20_Gaming> -Engine-
[3:20:24] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> having just a parry mechanic would possibly lead to a much slower experience
[3:20:28] <PP_Willpower> @willsimplybe she is motion
[3:20:29] <Strtfghtr88> Cid is from Peru and Sugar Daddy is her space ship
[3:20:34] <%PunchPlanetGame> @Parapattern thats def what i was going for glad you get that vibe
[3:20:38] <alloftheworld_1> Just noticed the T in Tyara LuL
[3:20:46] <+FiercePunchStudios> Tyara also looks like a Steven Universe gem, what with all the weapon summoning
[3:20:50] <majindusto> Thara i mean...Didn't see the T

[3:21:00] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> FINAL ROUND
[3:21:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> The T in Tyara is Clearly silent anyways
[3:21:03] <Nat20_Gaming> @nharliecash At least I can with this engine Game Maker wouldn't even let me code that in
[3:21:07] <+SlantedSped> i'm so sad this person keeps dropping whatever combo they're trying to do
[3:21:11] <Strtfghtr88> FiercePunchStudios oh you just said the words that should not be said
[3:21:12] <%Knopantz> It’s some Heavy Metal dinosaur riding space babe thing for me.
[3:21:35] <UnknownGerm> If I had to describe Tyara I'd say she's Red Sonja with hard light constructs.

[3:25:33] <+Cigwynn> Was that a 5 Sauske Combo???
[3:25:38] <%Commander_Deko> that ones not that edgy
[3:25:47] <ThisRebelLion> yeah, I mean, he literally nearly got everyone killed at least twice for showing mercy

[3:26:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Anime was a mistake
[3:26:10] <alloftheworld_1> Goku became a Super Saiyan specifically by remembering mercy in the heart of rage, or whatever
[3:26:25] <Predatorhahaha23000> edge
[3:26:28] <+conqab> edgy AND illiterate
[3:26:30] <cavefishes> i don't know if vegeta would love or hate these shirts
[3:26:31] <InfiniteSwagbito> Every time the shirts come on I want to look away but I can't
[3:26:38] <ThisRebelLion> majin vageta is the edgiest thing
[3:26:40] <kaine_west> I'm just saying you're never gonna see goofy ass Gon or pure boi Killua on any of these types of shirts
[3:26:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't look away from the truth
[3:27:02] <+cvp5127> oof that fairy tail one
[3:27:03] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> This isn't a grave, it's just the path you chose.
[3:27:09] <+thecmash> @InfiniteSwagbito ikr? what if theres a new shirt thats even worse than the last one
[3:27:17] <topendbuzza> @WoolieVersus I need kirby versions of these T-shirts yesterday.
[3:27:20] <InfiniteSwagbito> @CMash2k Exactly.
[3:27:22] <ThisRebelLion> @kaine_west ....please, someone put goofy ass Gon on one of these EDGY SHIRTS
[3:27:22] <+dankdirtydan> where's the punch planet at?
[3:27:23] <kaine_west> twisted Vegeta PunOko PunOko PunOko
[3:27:26] <alloftheworld_1> I'm just surprised how many times the same character and catchphrase show up
[3:27:39] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> @dankdirtydan just switched off, we going to some "weird shit" now
[3:27:52] <hotleaf_juice> These shirts are gold
[3:27:54] <alloftheworld_1> "I didn't fall from heaven" - Says the man who arrived on this planet from space
[3:27:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> isn't THIS the weird shit?
[3:28:12] <+dankdirtydan> is there an image album for all these shitty shirts?
[3:28:25] <kaine_west> the fairtail one is objectively the least bad
[3:28:44] <powerprotoman> yes its called woolies closet @dankdirtydan
[3:28:45] <InfiniteSwagbito> "Don't try to figure me out, a kind person learns lessons through pain"
[3:28:46] <kaine_west> 4 Twisted Vegeta's in 30 secs BibleThump
[3:28:50] <hotleaf_juice> But Goku always shows mercy in battle though
[3:28:53] <cavefishes> @kaine_west the worst thing about it is the font
[3:28:56] <cavefishes> shit's unreadable
[3:28:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> wheres the HunterXHunter tshirts?
[3:29:02] <heckengine> thats how you know hes just that twisted
[3:29:05] <spardanwarrior> Needs more Idaho
[3:29:05] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> that's what saves you from the pain though @cavefishes
[3:29:18] <InfiniteSwagbito> Yeah where the fuck is Idaho
[3:29:22] <alloftheworld_1> Now we need 4 Gokus in a row for the Kakarot Kombo
[3:29:23] <InfiniteSwagbito> I miss that shirt
[3:29:27] <+DesertOfSand> That Sasuke shirt is so long lol
[3:29:28] <kaine_west> I'd rather have bad indesipherable font than regardless, twisted or throne
[3:29:38] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> Well it's because that sasuke shit is on the back
[3:29:45] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> imagine walking away from someone and that's what they see
[3:29:50] <%linkwolf4> #FreeIdaho
[3:29:51] <+DesertOfSand> Makes me think of that one Thugalicious shirt
[3:29:54] <hntronium> These shirts are painful to see
[3:29:56] <alloftheworld_1> If they stand against you, send them to Idaho
[3:30:01] <spardanwarrior> IDAHO

[3:30:47] <hntronium> Who is that sleeping next to the brb?
[3:30:49] <Parapattern> I'm surprised there's not more Death Note ones.

[3:30:54] <topendbuzza> Like a real cute kirby
[3:31:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We need more Yugioh T's in this style

[3:31:29] <+DesertOfSand> Why is it so long
[3:31:30] <alloftheworld_1> You live in Idaho, you're a Super Potato at best LUL
[3:31:35] <hotleaf_juice> What why Idaho
[3:31:36] <%MACK_T0NIGHT> It's because it's on the back of the shirt @DesertOfSand
[3:31:37] <+DesertOfSand> Is that a shirt style I'm just wholly unfamiliar with?
[3:31:38] <spardanwarrior> This lineup desperately needs a "I'm abut to level up, and you look like you'll give me just enough EXP" shirt
[3:31:38] <%linkwolf4> Kirby sleeping after a long day of killing gods.
[3:31:43] <powerprotoman> theres a special place on hell for idaho
[3:31:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @DesertOfSand thats the back of the shirt
[3:31:48] <Parapattern> Every time Woolie is at a con someone needs to be there to hand deliver one of these babies to him
