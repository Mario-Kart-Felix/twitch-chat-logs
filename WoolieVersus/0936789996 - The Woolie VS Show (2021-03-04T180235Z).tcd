[0:02:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I only did the one ending, but it's the ending with all the stuff
[0:02:40] <niddron> wait is he gonna let Reggie do it? oh god that's cruel, I love it!
[0:02:58] <jamox1> Apparently Minh will be here!

[0:04:36] <Johannen> @CookieCutter007 Thanks, could not remember where i heard that exactly
[0:04:52] <Ashenik1> @niddron it was the best!!
[0:04:52] <Johannen> @CookieCutter007 Not a lot of russian vocals around)

[0:05:22] <HumBao> YEAH 2ND GIG
[0:05:29] <Johannen> Love the Ape fight, amazing boss
[0:05:31] <Indigo_Automaton> I hope he's brushed up his skills
[0:05:42] <Johannen> And not being spoiled on that made my day
[0:05:46] <andre11dr> Dude i should watch Ghost in The Shell and Akira again, it's been a long time since i last did
[0:05:51] <Ashenik1> Punished Woolie has returned! W has come to!
[0:05:52] <niddron> @ashenik1 a real "you motherfuckers" moment
[0:05:54] <jorniev> anji mito looked cool... too bad i could not care less
[0:05:57] <%Lion_kun> NO LP LEFT BEHIND
[0:06:04] <%X2Eliah> Man imagine the gmaeplay whiplash Reggie would get if he jumped from DeS to Sekiro
[0:06:11] <%Dirty_Dandere> Awaken Trash man woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[0:06:15] <BlackermanZX> Anji manwhore mito looks pretty good
[0:06:17] <%Mkingston> Any word on Woolie VS shirts being restocked?
[0:06:20] <HumBao> @andre11dr aw hell yeah
[0:06:42] <Ashenik1> @niddron  they were flexin with that boss !
[0:07:01] <Johannen> I am replaying Sekiro right now, cause i missed like 10% of the game
[0:07:03] <+RyTYoung> We back IN
[0:07:08] <Indigo_Automaton> I guess Woolie really got that Soulsbourne withdrawal hard if he's returning
[0:07:20] <efffifthhirddon> what song is this?
[0:07:23] <%X2Eliah> @Indigo_Automaton Woolie is training for Elden Ring
[0:07:23] <Ashenik1> man, Sekiro was the SHIT!
[0:07:24] <%ThisIsLloyd> laterGood laterVibes laterShaka
[0:07:34] <armchairmaster_> Sekiro: Woolie dies a Few Times
[0:07:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @Johannen  More than that, if you didnt do the good ending
[0:07:44] <Johannen> Even one of my friends starting again, this might be some sort of anomaly
[0:07:47] <%X2Eliah> Sekiro: the wall is real
[0:07:53] <andre11dr> Sekiro was really good, but everyone wanted a Souls game, and it wasn't one
[0:07:57] <%krispen_wa> WE PLAYIN GHOSTS OF NIOH
[0:08:02] <%TooManyGs> TooManyGs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Another month of some quality Woolie content. Thanks for always putting a smile on my face. Hope to get a Guilty Gear match with you when it comes out!
[0:08:09] <%Mkingston> I didn't get far into Sekiro. Way too hard and uninteresting for me. Managed to do DS1&3 last year.
[0:08:10] <jamox1> Sekiro: Woolie deals with verticality
[0:08:10] <Johannen> @fruit_pie_the_magician I did one of the hard ones on my first go and did Shura on NG+
[0:08:11] <%X2Eliah> ... same song looping?
[0:08:14] <+nabs2099> Sekiro is basically a Souls game without RPG stuff.
[0:08:18] <+SteinsApprentice> "Good" Ending?
[0:08:19] <%dreadedcthulhu> we loopin
[0:08:19] <niddron> @ashenik1 the boss wasn't even that hard, like Genishiro was a way bigger roadblock, but the fucking mental damage was very bad with the monkey
[0:08:20] <Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton Man I hope that fight with Robert's father was a trial run for fusing Sekiro's new combat with DS
[0:08:33] <%LastHazzerd> LastHazzerd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! had a fun time testing this game, hope you can have a fun time parrying for days... or just hitting the beast-like bosses until they die
[0:08:39] <+Zaedum> give me sekiro 2 already!
[0:08:39] <efffifthhirddon> if it's the same song then tell me what's it's called
[0:08:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:08:48] <Ashenik1> @nabs2099  and really polished combat !
[0:08:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I qualify the "good" ending as the one that actually lets you see the best areas in the game, and the best bosses
[0:08:59] <armchairmaster_> NO SPOILERS: There are several ways this story can end, and some are better than others.
[0:09:12] <Peyote_> @efffifthhirddon origa rise
[0:09:12] <+nabs2099> Yeah! It's amazing. I want Sekiro 2 to give us back the rpg stuff tho

[0:09:20] <ClutchSuts> Let's Seki-GOOOO
[0:09:21] <Indigo_Automaton> Man I wish Sekiro got DLC
[0:09:23] <andre11dr> If any From game gets a  sequel, pls let it be Bloodborne
[0:09:24] <+SteinsApprentice> ghostman samurai with a parasol is where I stopped playing
[0:09:28] <huskarl_zap> AMOGUS

[0:09:41] <Johannen> "Inner Universe" by Yoko Kanno ft. Origa
[0:09:41] <+nabs2099> Bloodborne by the B team would be phenomenal.
[0:09:41] <%X2Eliah> Time for Obito

[0:16:55] <Zeif00> b-big Kreygasm
[0:16:56] <munitalprats> **THE CODE**
[0:16:58] <JayCue_yt> owl is the OLDEST and MOST master sounding old master I've ever seen

[0:19:54] <+LeaIsChill> ???

[0:19:56] <+matteasy31> ICHIMOMJI
[0:19:58] <Lobster_Lord> parry > block > dodge
[0:20:09] <+TheotherKristian> Sekiro = Royal Guard: The Game
[0:20:14] <+matteasy31> Cheems favorite skill ICHIMOMJI double
[0:20:25] <munitalprats> @TheotherKristian you wont beat the game if you're just on the defense tho
[0:20:25] <Ashenik1> the red sword is very good for this fight
[0:20:28] <NiSoKr> Wookiee mashing out of that fake pressure
[0:20:31] <%LastHazzerd> yup, he has the shinobi style
[0:20:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Welcome back Woolie.....YOU MUST DIE LUL
[0:20:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Try Thrusting LUL LUL
[0:20:34] <AndyAsteroid> Weird how Woolie didn't like the game that based around parrying
[0:20:37] <quamdunk> Ichimonji gon save dat ass lemme tell ya
[0:20:37] <Johannen> @TheRealGreaterGamer I think Woolie also wants that but he plays it like Trickster
[0:20:41] <dashnack5> i home woolie does a lunge
[0:20:41] <SkreamnRedSkull> FOR GLORY WHEN?
[0:20:48] <Lobster_Lord> woolie needs to be more agressive
[0:20:50] <Th3rd3> the iframe is REAL
[0:20:52] <dizimous> Just barely got those I-frames
[0:20:59] <andre11dr> I think Woolie forgot that this game super rewards agression
[0:20:59] <%X2Eliah> Is this rollback based though?
[0:21:00] <Ashenik1> does this game have invincibility frames?
[0:21:02] <netrac> You gotta get in there!
[0:21:05] <Ravioli_Ronin> If you die in a samurai fight, you die in real life
[0:21:09] <%LastHazzerd> not quite, minh
[0:21:11] <Timarkot> Almost there
[0:21:14] <LordOfThePoultry> get in there woolie!
[0:21:21] <SkreamnRedSkull> Let Woolie fight like the samurai he wants to be
[0:21:21] <+LeaIsChill> He's stinky monkaS
[0:21:22] <Johannen> @Ashenik1 It has 100% block, who needs i frames
[0:21:22] <Th3rd3> heal reject
[0:21:24] <lioxor> woolie do a charged attack Kappa
[0:21:25] <armchairmaster_> D-did woolie forget about the Posture system?
[0:21:35] <%LastHazzerd> Lloyd's Talisman
[0:21:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the dodge has coupke iframes
[0:21:40] <munitalprats> you need to attack or the posture will go down.
[0:21:42] <munitalprats> keep pressure.
[0:21:51] <@Menitta> kill him
[0:21:52] <Lobster_Lord> wow, this game just doesn't click with some people huh
[0:21:55] <Darren716> Never stop going in
[0:21:58] <+matteasy31> Give him the 1-2 woolie Let's gooo
[0:21:59] <+LeaIsChill> Chat, don't start backseating immediately. That's not what this playthrough return is for
[0:22:00] <+TheotherKristian> Minh, keep talking
[0:22:01] <quamdunk> U gotta run at this man, Woolz
[0:22:03] <netrac> this game is weeb punch out
[0:22:04] <GothicCrusader> GUARD for posture recovery faster
[0:22:04] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus  red sword is an easy mode for this fight!
[0:22:12] <%LastHazzerd> the concentration is immense
[0:22:15] <+matteasy31> @netrac LUL
[0:22:15] <+Colby_DJ> @Lobster_Lord It is a very strange combat system
[0:22:15] <ElPlasa> Woolie the Iframe MASTER
[0:22:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is trying to Dark Souls this. A common mistake
[0:22:17] <dinnydanny777> don't get intimidated LUL
[0:22:20] <%JaseAdrift> this is such a sick fight
[0:22:22] <%X2Eliah> What's "red sword"?
[0:22:24] <munitalprats> i mean, the game is weird.
[0:22:25] <Solidnick18> woolie is in the zone
[0:22:26] <Prevot> didn't woolie say he'd been practicing and wasn't rusty at all?
[0:22:26] <EX_shuffle> He'll remember, it's been a while
[0:22:30] <+TheotherKristian> Woolie's face = The face of a thousand emotions
[0:22:31] <quamdunk> Mortal blade
[0:22:39] <Pookiedaexzile> THe most colorful of commentary
[0:22:41] <NiSoKr> I mean this works it’s just not as fast or safe.
[0:22:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:22:42] <Johannen> @BallerSwagBro9k Lot of people made this mistake and claimed this was the hardest souls game)

[0:22:49] <+matteasy31> Woolie Concentration 100%
[0:22:51] <Lobster_Lord> @Colby_DJ i actually like it a lot, but I see a lot of people struggle with it.
[0:22:51] <+mechslayer71> Did he just start the fight guys? Missed it. Did “the thing” happen?
[0:22:52] <netrac> once the rythm of a fight clicks the fight is mostly over

[0:23:55] <vVAstrAVv> good ending unlocks areas pls do
[0:23:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The fact that he knows to spam Ichimonji  gives me hope
[0:23:59] <+shootbang_exe> or did I mandela effect myself
[0:24:01] <SomersaultJustice> SPITETHROUGH
[0:24:06] <brunoberserk> woolie wants Owl blood
[0:24:08] <+matteasy31> Is this woolie's first playthrough?
[0:24:09] <+LeaIsChill> Now it's real
[0:24:09] <syanplague> i really hated this boss
[0:24:12] <%Lion_kun> It makes no difference
[0:24:14] <armchairmaster_> woolie wants to fight old man dad
[0:24:21] <andre11dr> Didn't they already do bad ending?
[0:24:22] <%JustYudha> THE CONFIDENCE LETS GO
[0:24:24] <%ChoculaUltra> it's my turn with the xbox, dad
[0:24:25] <%X2Eliah> So is this actual LP restart, or is this a one-off today?
[0:24:25] <quamdunk> Owl must die
[0:24:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at woolie thinking an optional boss is optional. are you crazy this is a From Soft game
[0:24:36] <+LeaIsChill> This is picking up where they left off
[0:24:38] <JetpackMcQuack> This is fine
[0:24:38] <Johannen> Woolie is playing it safe
[0:24:45] <%Dante_Namikaze1> @x2eliah he's continuing it
[0:24:45] <dinnydanny777> he kicc
[0:24:46] <+loukemia83> concenteating woolie has no time for banter
[0:24:46] <Lobster_Lord> @Colby_DJ ya, a lot of people just don't get how posture works. when it clicks, bosses feel like an intense rhythm game
[0:24:47] <EX_shuffle> I hated this boss until I loved it
[0:24:51] <andre11dr> Like why would Woolie come back just to do it again LUL
[0:25:00] <Solidnick18> jesus
[0:25:00] <Ashenik1> Woolie hates those boomers man he wants them dead with full concentration!
[0:25:04] <%X2Eliah> @Dante_Namikaze1 with this much passive agression between woolz and minh? hmmmmmm
[0:25:11] <%X2Eliah> Kappa
[0:25:11] <%krispen_wa> Woolie doesnt believe in posture
[0:25:12] <+rednecked__crake> 5'11" vs 6'0" right here
[0:25:13] <%paladinstarbuster> Why are ninjas so cool?
[0:25:15] <%JustYudha> That bullshit ass fire crackers
[0:25:18] <Th3rd3> F you Owl, my ear!! PunOko
[0:25:18] <jamox1> Owl Boomers die twice
[0:25:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Pic or didnt happen
[0:25:31] <JetpackMcQuack> All these bosses are legendary
[0:25:32] <Johannen> Guess the combat flow never clicked
[0:25:36] <%ThisIsLloyd> waynerF
[0:25:37] <%X2Eliah> @rednecked__crake Oh for sure, they are both close to 6 foot tall and let's say, 140 pounds?
[0:25:38] <+Dova573> Aggressive be be aggressive
[0:25:41] <@Solidus_113> got hit by the no heal stink
[0:25:44] <+0BM0Z> woolies gotta keep the pressure up or the posture bar is worthless
[0:25:46] <+0BM0Z> you gotta be aggressive
[0:25:46] <nutimik> you were hit by the anti-heal
[0:25:52] <NiSoKr> Heal blocked
[0:25:56] <ulcaban> Kick him in the dick- ninjas hate that!
[0:25:57] <%X2Eliah> @0BM0Z Unless he's not trying to posture
[0:26:04] <%krispen_wa> Is Woolie doing a no-posture break challenge run? what a pro
[0:26:05] <%ChoculaUltra> the leap in animation quality from DS3 to Sekiro is kinda wild
[0:26:06] <Johannen> Woolie is thinking about HP damage
[0:26:08] <Ashenik1> Man this game and combat look so smooth!!!
[0:26:09] <radar410> Woolie's really trying to play this defensively huh
[0:26:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie has mastered Nioh and Demon's Souls now. He has achieved S K I L L
[0:26:14] <%Livelinne> so it is basically a rhythm game OhMyDog
[0:26:15] <+matteasy31> Kappa
[0:26:16] <+0BM0Z> @0BM0Z kinda feels like a waste of a game mechanic then
[0:26:17] <+LeaIsChill> Woolie has been playing so much Strive he forgot what pressure is Kappa
[0:26:17] <Ashenik1> Kappa
[0:26:18] <+Mendin> The posture bar is also kinda worthless at high HP anyway
[0:26:19] <$horse_oil> damn minh
[0:26:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oh fuck me those shitty messages are IN THE BOSS ROOM?
[0:26:37] <Claella> mihn thats cold
[0:26:39] <%Livelinne> oh no it's a rhythm game NotLikeThis
[0:26:45] <Peyote_> The real tech is to target hp until about half health and then start deflecting for posture
[0:26:46] <Johannen> @Mendin Not if you keep the presure up and not let them recover
[0:26:47] <NiSoKr> @mendin no it isn’t you just have to always be attacking
[0:26:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Demon of hatred legitimately felt like Guitar Hero 3 hard
[0:26:49] <+BigBruthaThunda> "why are we still here..."
[0:26:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I guarantee they all say try thrusting attacks
[0:26:52] <dinnydanny777> @fruit_pie_the_magician Maybe the messages can offer advice Kappa
[0:26:54] <%Livelinne> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:26:56] <Equirah> @Livelinne that's all from soft's "action" games have ever been
[0:26:56] <mergley> need to be way more aggressive
[0:26:57] <munitalprats> @Mendin posture is always faster and easier if you keep pressuring them
[0:27:09] <Lobster_Lord> all actions are rhythm games at the end of the day
[0:27:10] <dizimous> Dang woolie is way more passive than me
[0:27:12] <Peyote_> Posture regenerates way slower if they have less health
[0:27:15] <GeoffGeofreed> why is he still fighting him if he already beat him
[0:27:21] <%LastHazzerd> "might as well get paid to do this"
[0:27:23] <quamdunk> Still haven’t gotten thru the DoH 😖 damn near 3 years l8tr
[0:27:29] <+0BM0Z> ye but you dont need to do hp damage if you keep the posture up LUL
[0:27:30] <%Livelinne> @equirah even the souls one too?
[0:27:35] <+matteasy31> You got this!
[0:27:36] <+LeaIsChill> You don't need to one shot him, just glad this LP is back
[0:27:39] <andre11dr> Oh ,he got to Monk
[0:27:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Why get fucked for free right?
[0:27:42] <andre11dr> Ok
[0:27:44] <theDromader> Dude Im so glad youre back in, its very good especially near the end.
[0:27:49] <NiSoKr> DoH is super overrated it’s just a bloodborne boss
[0:27:50] <%ekodrop> yo minhs back
[0:27:55] <Equirah> @Livelinne *specially* the souls ones
[0:28:00] <+MajorCrasher> oh no, the consumables mind goblins are here
[0:28:00] <Kohei_kyouji> isnt there a better checkpoint somewhere?
[0:28:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Maybe they can offer advice on how to avoid your inputs being eaten when you activate them accidentally
[0:28:04] <SenpaiMD> wait when did woolie restart sekiro
[0:28:06] <%sporeian94> CAN WE GET AN OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IN THE CHAT FOR ELDEN RING?
[0:28:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Owl is such a cool design
[0:28:07] <munitalprats> That's because DoH just straight up doesnt fit in sekiro
[0:28:09] <Lobster_Lord> What trips people up with Sekiro is there are correct and incorrect ways to play
[0:28:10] <+loukemia83> @woolieversus there is no wrong way to play, only dead bosses
[0:28:11] <%Livelinne> @equirah good to know that. thanks
[0:28:12] <brunoberserk> no consumable = pat style of life
[0:28:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie Woolie he's our man, He won't use the tools that are in the game because he can
[0:28:15] <%LastHazzerd> @SenpaiMD nope, pick up where left off
[0:28:16] <%ThisIsLloyd> OHHHHHHHH
[0:28:17] <dinnydanny777> oof that tracked
[0:28:20] <%jinking79> damn headless
[0:28:20] <Ashenik1> nah red sword even without emblems is pretty OP for the this boomer fight!
[0:28:21] <+rednecked__crake> Why is the streamer not spamming firecrackers? jiyuBigbrain
[0:28:23] <%ChoculaUltra> OHHHHHHHH
[0:28:24] <quamdunk> See and Bloodbourne makes me PISS myself w/ rage
[0:28:24] <%X2Eliah> @SenpaiMD Just after getting Reggie into souls
[0:28:29] <syanplague> that one thing i never liked about Sekiro the abilitys feel like a consumable iten[
[0:28:32] <andre11dr> I do like DoH in that it's a weird monster and this game kinda lacks in those
[0:28:33] <StarkAvKnark> You got this, man you got this by the ass
[0:28:36] <radar410> @munitalprats DoH fits Sekiro if you actually parry him like any other boss
[0:28:39] <%illtima> Don't forget that shurikens deal a fuckton of damage to airbornes
[0:28:42] <Deasmeister> I wish they made emblems recharge on rest people dont use tools because they're saving them
[0:28:43] <Johannen> @Lobster_Lord Its Souls all over again, people were not expecting to learn how to fight again
[0:28:47] <+krispen_wa> Would Sekiro be a better game if it had RPG mechanics?
[0:28:51] <Dave_VD> THE RETURN
[0:28:53] <munitalprats> @radar410 you take massive amounts of chip damage, parrying him isnt good
[0:28:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Does....how know about like......how long this game is?
[0:28:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> DoH fits sekiro if you are actually good at the game SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:29:00] <quamdunk> @krispen_wa prolly not
[0:29:04] <Th3rd3> getting that posture
[0:29:07] <%ChoculaUltra> it would be better if it had a just a few more weapons tbh
[0:29:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Just do it 4Head : The Game
[0:29:20] <+RyTYoung> Let's goooo
[0:29:20] <+DappercatEsquire> @krispen_wa it wouldn't be the same game at all, Sekiro has a specific playstyle that it wants the player to adhere too
[0:29:23] <%LastHazzerd> woolie, fan of StreetFighter, is good at footsies
[0:29:24] <Ashenik1> @andre11dr  honestly it actualy fits for the combat to have mostly human opponents. Like Owl and Machingun Saint are the best
[0:29:24] <Johannen> @munitalprats Chip damage on normal difficulty? That's not a thing
[0:29:32] <%X2Eliah> This fight would be better on a horse.
[0:29:34] <quamdunk> If anything it’s already RPG like
[0:29:35] <Lobster_Lord> @Johannen Ya, except Souls had more options like magic cheese, shields, and strength weapons.
[0:29:38] <Prevot> @krispen_wa I say Souls games would be better with less RPG mechanics, see Bloodborne
[0:29:39] <SenpaiMD> you can parry everything very easily on normal
[0:29:41] <EX_shuffle> This guy takes "are ya winning son?" too seriously
[0:29:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[0:29:43] <radar410> @munitalprats Haven't noticed him doing any more chip damage than any other boss tbh
[0:29:49] <netrac> Sekiro has a lot less "outs" than a souls game
[0:29:53] <SenpaiMD> no chip ifyou perfect parry
[0:29:54] <%Deekman> can we get a smug Mihn emote lol
[0:29:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolfree
[0:30:00] <fjordicjordic> is this the first session back since the original run?
[0:30:03] <SenpaiMD> or if you block regularly for that matter
[0:30:06] <BlackDae> didn't woolie beat sekiro already? why the second playthrough? no complaints
[0:30:06] <+krispen_wa> woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[0:30:10] <%JustYudha> Reset
[0:30:11] <munitalprats> @Johannen its because he does fire damage, which goes through your parries. i had the fire shield but you only have that for a certain amount of time (and its overall a weaker strategy than that one whistle)
[0:30:12] <Lobster_Lord> I love how different Sekiro is
[0:30:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Don't sweat it woolie this game and this dude are both huge assholes
[0:30:15] <+LeaIsChill> Woolie hasn't used his red blade at all tho
[0:30:17] <Clundy> Sekiro is Learn the move set or die
[0:30:20] <brunoberserk> i know Owl is a piece of shit but his design is so COOL PogChamp
[0:30:21] <Klefth> God, the parry sound effect in this game is bliss... Kreygasm
[0:30:21] <Ashenik1> man I love sekiro combat system I hope they will implent it into Elden Ring
[0:30:28] <NiSoKr> Dont you still take posture chip on parry you just can’t break unless you miss one?

[0:30:28] <Fareflight_> Fighting beasts in souls is fun, Fighting beasts in Sekiro isn't that great. Especially DOH and the reused fight.
[0:30:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Owl got that drip
[0:30:41] <%ChoculaUltra> Drip Owl
[0:30:43] <quamdunk> Elden ring is gonna be crack I can feel it
[0:30:45] <JetpackMcQuack> !motivated
[0:30:45] <@Moobot> 2084 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:30:47] <Lobster_Lord> @Fareflight_ disagree
[0:30:50] <%ChoculaUltra> it's the giant ponytail for me tbh
[0:30:52] <Ashenik1> @Fareflight_  the monkey fight was really fun IMHO
[0:30:54] <%Deekman> Woolie's SO much less aggressive than I was in this fight lol
[0:30:58] <+krispen_wa> All I want from Elden Ring to take from this is the jumping
[0:31:01] <dinnydanny777> ooo he did the cool guy slow walk
[0:31:03] <+krispen_wa> which it did
[0:31:06] <theDromader> Its been a minute since I last played it but yea, this game is the peak of "learn the pattern or die"
[0:31:10] <EX_shuffle> DOH is great
[0:31:11] <radar410> @munitalprats He only does fire damage on certain hits, most of them don't actually apply the fire effect iirc
[0:31:17] <Johannen> @munitalprats Sorry must have missed what boss you were talking about, thought this it was about Owl
[0:31:19] <%paladinstarbuster> I fully believe Elden ring WILL be ass
[0:31:20] <dizimous> Monkey fight is great, Damon of hatred drives me crazy but it's still got a lot going for it
[0:31:21] <pixel_river> i learned at the genichiro fight that agressiveness was important in this, the hard way
[0:31:22] <+RyTYoung> Good shit good shiiiit
[0:31:30] <netrac> What I love about this game is when you beat a boss you typically domitate it super hard
[0:31:32] <Aydarkzero> return to Sekiro Woolie strikes back Edition
[0:31:33] <Fareflight_> @Ashenik1 That's the only beast fight that's alright, and they reuse that fight which makes me hate it.
[0:31:36] <%paladinstarbuster> or t least underwhelming
[0:31:40] <+DappercatEsquire> I got all the way to Sword Saint and quit
[0:31:45] <mr_saturday93> omg Woolie is going back to sekiro?
[0:31:47] <Lobster_Lord> does woolie know blocking actually reduces posture buildup?
[0:31:48] <Ashenik1> @Fareflight_  yeah they fucked it up...
[0:31:49] <moeartifact> your posture recovers faster while blocking
[0:31:52] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa It also seems to take the stealth too ,which is cool
[0:31:53] <+RyTYoung> @aydarkzero Revenge of the Wolf
[0:31:54] <nintega010> @netrac that's honestly the only way to beat a boss
[0:31:54] <Aydarkzero> @DappercatEsquire Hesitation is defeat
[0:31:57] <jv5_guy> @paladinstarbuster lets hops its not dark souls 2 2.0
[0:31:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie play this like Blanka and the bosses will fall at your feet
[0:32:00] <quamdunk> Glock saint looks fun asl cannot wait
[0:32:01] <Solidnick18> wolf dad PogChamp
[0:32:03] <Aydarkzero> @RyTYoung rad af
[0:32:09] <+LeaIsChill> That run LUL
[0:32:11] <+TheotherKristian> Let's go Woolie
[0:32:13] <Johannen> Its not even aggressivenes, its more of a tug of war or a dance. You go keep and forth trying to maintain your momentum
[0:32:14] <%JustYudha> JustYudha subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! I barely finished this game by myself with little to no distractions. Can't imagine how it feels streaming with hundreds of eyes looking for mistakes dude.
[0:32:17] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:32:17] <+DappercatEsquire> @Aydarkzero Well usually his semi auto was defeat, but hesitation too
[0:32:21] <Timarkot> Throw
[0:32:21] <%paladinstarbuster> @jv5_guy yeah lets
[0:32:22] <Coystick> Ka CHUNK
[0:32:24] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CarlTheBlind
[0:32:25] <+RyTYoung> @aydarkzero So rad! Love Sekiro!
[0:32:31] <%Deekman> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:32:36] <%sporeian94> Unlocking is the worst thing to do in this game woolie
[0:32:43] <%MrSpacePan> The Pacific Rim anime just dropped today
[0:32:46] <+krispen_wa> so chat, where's Emma on the Fromsoft waifu tier list
[0:32:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Sprinting is strong tech
[0:32:48] <Lobster_Lord> Woolie's royal guard style is lacking
[0:32:50] <Ashenik1> Machinegun Saint fight is propably the best last boss of souls games incuding DLCs!
[0:32:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I mean if Woolie can beat this boss by dodging and jumping like it Dark Souls instead of playing it as rhythm game more power to him lol
[0:32:55] <andre11dr> DS3 Was apparently supposed to have stealth originally but it got cut
[0:33:01] <Johannen> Yeah, Woolie is not embarcing ROyal Guard
[0:33:01] <+matteasy31> Emma is mid tier
[0:33:04] <+BigDumBeak> that last round was great, you def got this woolie
[0:33:08] <+RyTYoung> @krispen_wa Emma is top tier ngl
[0:33:09] <NiSoKr> Yeah you can get a really good punish like that. If you get behind bosses you can hit them 2-4 times
[0:33:17] <quamdunk> I like how waifu is censored lmaoooo
[0:33:28] <Peyote_> @rytyoung agreed
[0:33:38] <Equirah> @TheRealGreaterGamer how is that not a rythm game still LUL
[0:33:49] <nutimik> he was locked on, but sprinting makes you ignore lockon
[0:33:53] <srv4254> try and deflect his flip attack
[0:33:56] <+RyTYoung> The Japanese love the name Emma, it's been appearing in loads of different types of media
[0:33:57] <EX_shuffle> The game breaks lockon sometimes
[0:33:58] <quamdunk> Emma above Orin???
[0:34:16] <brunoberserk> Woolie looks T E N S E
[0:34:24] <Holycow8498> Is Woolie continuing where he left off?
[0:34:27] <NiSoKr> I never had lock-on trouble
[0:34:31] <@Solidus_113> you lose the strafe when you sprint locked on iirc
[0:34:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @TheRealGreaterGamer because "normal" sekiro is hit hit hit CLANG deflect deflect deflect hit hit hit CLANG etc lol
[0:34:43] <munitalprats> i think you can lose lockon by sprinting, but its weird.
[0:34:48] <Johannen> Yeah the Combat Flow
[0:34:51] <munitalprats> it depends on the boss i guess.
[0:34:57] <nutimik> only lock on I lost is with Lady Butterfly
[0:35:17] <Lobster_Lord> @TheRealGreaterGamer yep, thats the way to play. lots of people like to run and jump around instead for some reason
[0:35:23] <therealtacopancakes> Yooo the dokapon king is bacl! Nice to see Minh! Did woolie star the game over?
[0:35:29] <%ThisIsLloyd> is it a distance thing maybe??
[0:35:37] <+RyTYoung> I don't know how useful using your firecrackers would be in this fight
[0:35:40] <dinnydanny777> That Smelter Demon overhead swing
[0:35:43] <miklerstikler> that's what got u last time 😀
[0:35:43] <moeartifact> from what I remember, some boss moves force you to lose your lock-on
[0:35:45] <+matteasy31> SourPls
[0:35:50] <pixel_river> i missed fire crackers until near the end of the game, ngl
[0:35:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Firecrackers are OP in every humanoid fight
[0:35:56] <JetpackMcQuack> It's all corner up here
[0:35:56] <+RyTYoung> LOUD
[0:35:57] <+krispen_wa> Just use Crystal Soul Spear Woolie
[0:35:57] <Johannen> I am a huge sword and board guy in Souls so this game playstyle is so my thing
[0:36:06] <Solidnick18> that posture tho
[0:36:07] <+fullmetalheartx> NotLikeThis
[0:36:15] <vVAstrAVv> chat whats those purple things on the ground i dont remember ever seeing them
[0:36:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Messages
[0:36:24] <munitalprats> They are messages, they were added later
[0:36:25] <%Josef_Stryker> They're messages
[0:36:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Added in a patch
[0:36:28] <netrac> It would be neat if souls implemented a defllect thing for shields
[0:36:32] <JetpackMcQuack> monkaS
[0:36:33] <nutimik> I'm wondering, can you poison owl with Sabimaru?
[0:36:34] <Ashenik1> the problem with Sekiro combat is it doenst allow for variations in blocking or attacking which in the end just makes it rythmic game and not flexible system ;d
[0:36:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Try tongue but whole
[0:36:40] <Clundy> “Drop Your Shield” vibes coming from this boss fight
[0:36:42] <haitakaa> eyyy minh good to see you
[0:36:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:36:55] <+LeaIsChill> @Ashenik1 You're describing design choices, not problems LUL
[0:36:56] <Equirah> @netrac you mean the parry? LUL
[0:36:58] <andre11dr> Sticky white stuff required ahead
[0:37:00] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp Ichimonji
[0:37:04] <Lobster_Lord> @Clundy its the opposite, Woolie needs to raise his shield more
[0:37:06] <vVAstrAVv> dang i might go in and see what this games message system is like
[0:37:10] <+krispen_wa> try tongue but hole
[0:37:11] <EX_shuffle> Don't give up, skeleton
[0:37:19] <%Lion_kun> You think this is bad. This is nothing compared to Owl Father.
[0:37:19] <Kusano123> pretty much yea, parry is the answer to everything unless its the red prompt lol
[0:37:25] <Deasmeister> My trick was to ping him with shurukens to stop his posture going down
[0:37:27] <Clundy> @lobster_lord exactly LUL
[0:37:35] <netrac> @netrac more like a well timed guard, less risky, but only, prevents stamina loss or something like that
[0:37:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Ashenik1 I half agree but then you take a look at Sunhilegends twitter and realize you and everyone else are just garbage at Sekiro and will never be as badass as that fucking guy
[0:37:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Lion_kun Or the Demon
[0:37:42] <Holycow8498> You can do it Woolie
[0:37:46] <%Seancicle> OH! They're telling stories.
[0:37:50] <theDromader> Im just glad he didnt actually lock himself into the bad ending like I thought. Or maybe he did and thats why its back now after so long. Im just glad he's gonna see the rest of the game.
[0:37:53] <+Sharmanyx> Yeeeee naruto time bby
[0:37:54] <pennykettle_> oh boy lets do this
[0:37:58] <Johannen> @Ashenik1 I think it works great for what its trying to do, more cinematic flowing combat instead of chopy,short burst or dodge spam
[0:38:04] <vVAstrAVv> dont give up, darlington
[0:38:10] <Pookiedaexzile> In Dark Souls you hollow out your character, In Sekiro your character hollows out you
[0:38:14] <%SainEdge> raise your blade woolie!
[0:38:14] <netrac> @Ashenik1 You have optiones if you use the skills and tools during the fights
[0:38:25] <haitakaa> wwnd what would naruto do
[0:38:31] <+LeaIsChill> Sekiro : Shadows Stand Still
[0:38:31] <%kewlmyc> THE WALL
[0:38:32] <Lobster_Lord> attack -> attack -> block. as long as you listen for the enemy sound ques, you know when to block
[0:38:32] <+mechslayer71> Woolie doing this off stream robbed us of seeing the Mikiri counter NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:38:34] <Kusano123> offense is the best defense in this game
[0:38:38] <Coystick> he's so goddamn cool
[0:38:39] <pennykettle_> fuck off I JUST got a notification that the stream started
[0:38:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @pennykettle_ Me too Twitch is hella broken
[0:38:56] <vVAstrAVv> naruto would rasengan cus everything is rasengan
[0:38:56] <TheRealGreaterGamer> For example the first time a beat Owl I just threw oil on him and burned him twice before beginning the fight
[0:39:00] <%kewlmyc> @pennykettle_ You haven't missed much LUL
[0:39:06] <%Lion_kun> Woolie is being too defensive. He needs to stop reacting and pressure the boss.
[0:39:12] <+MajorCrasher> You really can't play this like souls, you just make things harder for no reason tbh
[0:39:18] <netrac> Do a thrust attack Woolie! /s
[0:39:21] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro gameplay is so weird looking when the person playing it is passive
[0:39:26] <Clundy> Woolie needs to throw away the shield
[0:39:26] <dizimous> If you genuinely believe sekiro is just a rhythm game because of deflections you're not experimenting enough
[0:39:27] <quamdunk> U got this woolz!! Parry and punish!!!
[0:39:31] <xeros720> yeah, i always called it punch out
[0:39:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @mechslayer71 I KNOW
[0:39:37] <xeros720> but you can play it like a fighting game
[0:39:39] <%kewlmyc> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[0:39:48] <CraZ80> @pennykettle_ yeah, Twitch is pretty shit with these late notifications
[0:39:48] <3Xgilly> @Lion_kun tru dat
[0:39:49] <Solidnick18> damn he is going in
[0:39:49] <Lobster_Lord> all action games are just punch out at the end of the day
[0:39:49] <Ashenik1> @LeaIsChill  I guess, its just after 100% the combat got boring and repetetive  but I gues it  was meant to be this short and not complicated fighting system I wish From could make in Elden Ring ;d
[0:40:07] <vVAstrAVv> see what i mean?
[0:40:08] <+Tucker0603> I love how this and nioh both have the stamina system for bosses
[0:40:08] <CoffeeSlice> ALMOST THERE
[0:40:09] <Fareflight_> @Lion_kun I mean yeah he can but, this boss is mostly a wait for an opening kind of guy. It's a health bar fight because he recovers posture quickly.
[0:40:11] <Johannen> Yeah, the longer the fight goes on the more mistakes you can make, so playing passive is costing you more hp
[0:40:12] <vVAstrAVv> perfect
[0:40:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Well he's dong it
[0:40:17] <+mechslayer71> Why is woolie so passive?
[0:40:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> oops
[0:40:24] <andre11dr> I really Mikiri counter only becoming a thing in faze two
[0:40:25] <xeros720> yeah, stamina systems for bosses is awesome
[0:40:31] <Peyote_> Also owl is actually easy to stagger if you can land a hit
[0:40:37] <+krispen_wa> nioh does the stamina system way better though. because niohs a better game
[0:40:40] <+Tuffty> I think I would have enjoyed Sekiro's combat more if the prosthetic tools and combat skills weren't tied to the same consumable resource. Also if the prosthetic upgrade tree wasn't so terrible. Still, good game.
[0:40:49] <+LeaIsChill> @krispen_wa Kappa
[0:40:50] <%0rond> @mechslayer71 that's how woolie do, although the game does kinda push you towards it
[0:40:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @dizimous The game doesnt reward you for experimenting though. You waste resources, time, and effort that might not pay off when you can always rely on basic deflections to win.
[0:40:58] <Coystick> I love that raising your posture is the exact opposite of dropping your shied
[0:40:58] <%Seancicle> OSFrog
[0:40:59] <+Tucker0603> @krispen_wa this is true
[0:41:00] <pennykettle_> yea boi
[0:41:02] <Solidnick18> that's 1
[0:41:04] <Mr_216> KomodoHype
[0:41:04] <twoto858> One down!
[0:41:05] <CoffeeSlice> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:41:07] <vVAstrAVv> can confirm nioh better game lol
[0:41:10] <%SainEdge> Jebaited
[0:41:11] <Lobster_Lord> People compare this game too much to Souls/Nioh. The posture system forces you to approach differently
[0:41:11] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp
[0:41:11] <%Tearonex> ROUND 2 FIGHT
[0:41:12] <+krispen_wa> M-MATTE
[0:41:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> MERCY
[0:41:13] <xeros720> the fact you lose resources is really the worst part of this and bloodborne
[0:41:14] <%kewlmyc> woot!
[0:41:15] <Johannen> @krispen_wa But that combat is not as flowing, you just try to abuse the combo chains
[0:41:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LOL
[0:41:21] <Solidnick18> Jebaited
[0:41:25] <+DappercatEsquire> haha jk
[0:41:25] <JayCue_yt> KNOCK HIM OUT THE BOX LUKE
[0:41:25] <%kewlmyc> Jebaited
[0:41:25] <Indigo_Automaton> He knows! :D
[0:41:29] <SenpaiMD> nioh vs sekiro ResidentSleeper
[0:41:30] <Ashenik1> Jebaited
[0:41:32] <andre11dr> I'll give that to Nioh 2 ,but fuck Nioh 1 tho
[0:41:32] <Solidnick18> you fool!
[0:41:33] <ulcaban> Smoke time
[0:41:33] <netrac> The spirit things are so plentiful in this game tho
[0:41:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Weak stuff old man
[0:41:44] <vVAstrAVv> 2 is godly
[0:41:47] <+mechslayer71> He’s already done this fight before guys
[0:41:49] <%Tearonex> Get ready for bullshit
[0:41:50] <xeros720> they can be, but i was definitely buying them to make them more plentiful
[0:41:51] <Johannen> @krispen_wa And trying to get thru blocks on some of the later enemies is imposible
[0:41:57] <+RyTYoung> yeyeye
[0:41:57] <ulcaban> Ouchie
[0:42:00] <+LeaIsChill> And yet it doesn't matter if you don't follow up LUL
[0:42:04] <dinnydanny777> oh no green goo
[0:42:05] <Ashenik1> In what way Nioh 2 is better than the 1st one?
[0:42:15] <moeartifact> hold block while strafing, you recover posture faster
[0:42:17] <+Tucker0603> he's throwing his poopoo
[0:42:25] <srv4254> 2 is way better than 1 yea
[0:42:28] <dinnydanny777> stinky stinky owl
[0:42:30] <caninedog1998> what's up with woolie? he has been silent most of the time
[0:42:30] <vVAstrAVv> new mechanics and way more enemy variety
[0:42:31] <ulcaban> Red vs Green
[0:42:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I love Nioh and Sekiro but I much prefer the Kurosawa aesthetic of Tsushima
[0:42:38] <Solidnick18> shhhhhh minh
[0:42:39] <theDromader> Wait did Woolie eat Sekiro off-stream once already? Or just this fight?
[0:42:40] <Clundy> @caninedog1998 Focusing
[0:42:46] <miklerstikler> it just go's everywhere
[0:42:47] <+Tucker0603> 2 is one of my favorite recent games
[0:42:48] <JetpackMcQuack> life is poison
[0:42:52] <JayCue_yt> You can SEE the tension in his gameplay
[0:42:56] <+krispen_wa> @ashenik1 lots more balancing. yokai counter lets you keep going in. lot less bullshit. perfected combat flow with stamina break mechanics
[0:43:00] <+yukichocomilk> @Ashenik1 every way basically
[0:43:02] <xeros720> uh oh, stinky
[0:43:05] <OblivionSword1> POISON POISON POISON
[0:43:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieMINHMAX
[0:43:08] <%cache_22> woolieDATTEBAYO Poison
[0:43:08] <+Tucker0603> I love how much of an ass owl is
[0:43:12] <caninedog1998> @Clundy yeah that makes sense
[0:43:13] <%Juriasu> I know Woolie is doing his best especially after a long break, but man it hurts seeing him lose Owls posture damage because he is so passive
[0:43:19] <vVAstrAVv> actually just everything. 2s better than 1 in everything
[0:43:20] <EX_shuffle> Is he out of pellets
[0:43:27] <Lobster_Lord> i mean with gameplay like this, how is chat NOT gonna backseat?
[0:43:30] <+pat_cchan> the game actually has a pause so i feel like poison is not so bad
[0:43:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Only one way out now
[0:43:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Tucker0603 HE NEEDS MORE POWER
[0:43:33] <+krispen_wa> Nioh 2 is literally 1 but better
[0:43:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Does he have rice from the Divine Child?
[0:43:39] <+chiazam> Did Woolie do any warm-up before coming back?
[0:43:41] <+LeaIsChill> @Lobster_Lord I mean, that's just rude
[0:43:41] <OldManDeckardCain> DROP YOUR SHIELD OOLIE
[0:43:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Mine as well get a aggressive your taking damage ever y second
[0:43:44] <bear_breaker20> but y is Owl so big
[0:43:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:43:49] <biggdaddymike> Chat is really holding in the urge to backseat
[0:43:51] <pennykettle_> @Lobster_Lord idk maybe by being a decent human
[0:43:56] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He should probably get the most overpowered consumable in the game lol
[0:43:57] <+krispen_wa> YEAH DO THE SWORD THING
[0:43:59] <netrac> @biggdaddymike holding in?
[0:44:04] <Johannen> I am playing thru Nioh 1 DLC right now and getting kinda stopmed by One Hit Kills on most enemeis
[0:44:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @bear_breaker20 Watch Plague of Gripes Huge Quest video
[0:44:06] <+Dorf1> @chiazam yes, he actually beat this boss off-screen
[0:44:07] <SenpaiMD> @bear_breaker20 this game is secretly a punchout sequel
[0:44:07] <Clundy> @
[0:44:08] <pixel_river> wow that damage
[0:44:09] <Mr_216> lepHMM
[0:44:13] <@Solidus_113> the sweet mortal draw
[0:44:16] <JetpackMcQuack> I promise you he's not reading chat
[0:44:18] <+Tucker0603> @ballerswagbro9k owl is the embodiment of play to win, he'd do that dark souls bowing bullshit that Pat says he does
[0:44:20] <dizimous> @therealgreatergamer hmm, I guess I'd prefer if deflections were a solid and rewarding answer less of the time, but I disagree that the cost of experimenting is too high. I'm not just talking about shinobi tools, even dodging instead of blocking some attacks can give you more hp and posture damage and it's free
[0:44:25] <+krispen_wa> WHIFF
[0:44:29] <munitalprats> HERE IT COMES
[0:44:30] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[0:44:30] <andre11dr> Ok let me backseat him, Hei Woolie use the sword!
[0:44:32] <Coystick> HE PARRIED the mortal blade fucK
[0:44:41] <%X2Eliah> It's pretty cool how Minh is literally facetiming rn
[0:44:43] <+shootbang_exe> sound of clenched butthole
[0:44:43] <ullyzeez> oh hey minh's here!
[0:44:44] <andre11dr> Ah see what a good listener
[0:44:45] <Lobster_Lord> is backseating necessarily bad? if the play is passive/slow, people are naturally gonna comment on it. idk why streamers get offended by this sort of talk.
[0:44:51] <T_Sasquatch> concentration faceeeee
[0:44:52] <Timarkot> I would spam items at this point
[0:44:54] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[0:44:54] <+DappercatEsquire> does the heal block gas matter if he doesn't have heals?

[0:45:03] <%ekodrop> close
[0:45:04] <munitalprats> @Timarkot there are no spammable items in skeiro
[0:45:04] <JayCue_yt> I believe in woolie
[0:45:06] <+loukemia83> if you arent healing, may as well go in when he drops the little no healing ball
[0:45:06] <%paladinstarbuster> good hits in tho
[0:45:07] <Solidnick18> that crouch
[0:45:08] <+Gallhint> Almost! you got this woolz
[0:45:08] <pennykettle_> good try
[0:45:08] <srv4254> why do people not like backseating really
[0:45:08] <blastazoid00> FeelsBadMan
[0:45:08] <%Javaa01> @DappercatEsquire Nope
[0:45:10] <+Tucker0603> great attempt
[0:45:11] <+mechslayer71> This fight has been so much less hype than it could be
[0:45:13] <EX_shuffle> You've got it
[0:45:13] <andre11dr> He ded
[0:45:16] <+mechslayer71> Good try doe
[0:45:17] <bear_breaker20> how long has he been at it ?
[0:45:18] <%ekodrop> so where are the fire bombs?
[0:45:19] <+penjaza> You can use antidote from pause menu
[0:45:21] <+pat_cchan> you got this man!
[0:45:21] <pixel_river> The pulse always rises during the end of boss fights in this
[0:45:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Getting there for sure
[0:45:21] <T_Sasquatch> thats a thicc ass health bar holy shit
[0:45:23] <+NYCrownlessKing> dumb question @srv4254
[0:45:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 3rd attempt
[0:45:26] <Clundy> Believe in the Woolie that believes in you!
[0:45:27] <netrac> I love sekiro but Rot is fucking pointless
[0:45:27] <ullyzeez> @lobster_lord for woolie's purpose? these streams are usually trying to emulate the old LP style for his YT channel
[0:45:27] <+LeaIsChill> @srv4254 Because offering advice to people who aren't asking is nonsensical
[0:45:31] <Coystick> Be aggressive Wools
[0:45:33] <dinnydanny777> Hit him till he dies limesOk
[0:45:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also you can pause this game
[0:45:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lol why is chat so whiney
[0:45:41] <+Gallhint> Also good to see minh again
[0:45:42] <Jaxnos> blade still works without emblems
[0:45:42] <Johannen> I dont know how Woolie is gonna fight some of the next bosses if he is this passive still
[0:45:44] <%Lion_kun> Woolie you can pause and take an antidote.
[0:45:45] <mingohead> you got this woolie!
[0:45:48] <NiSoKr> Mortal draw is pretty bad after you run out of emblems. Might want to switch back to double ichimonji
[0:45:52] <GeoffGeofreed> I remember in this game you can just pause it in the menu. so you can take an antidote there
[0:45:55] <+krispen_wa> Just use the Fume Ultra Greatsword Woolie
[0:46:01] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa  but like do you think Nioh has a better combat system than Sekiro or just Nioh has more variations?
[0:46:03] <munitalprats> you can do it woolie!
[0:46:04] <+Sharmanyx> Use flame vent
[0:46:10] <+krispen_wa> @ashenik1 yes
[0:46:11] <ullyzeez> just backstab :)
[0:46:18] <+LuckyRoooooo> Gl Woolie
[0:46:18] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> like chill the fuck out and let Woolie di his thing
[0:46:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> So is Woolie just going to be bereft of Rice for the rest of this LP because he doesnt remember anything and wont read chat to backseat? lol
[0:46:21] <theDromader> Rot was probably way worse initially so they nerfed it but didnt want it gone completely
[0:46:22] <+Gallhint> THWAP THWAP
[0:46:23] <Lobster_Lord> @X2Eliah i don't know about it being helpful, but its interesting to talk about the different, sometimes incorrect ways people approach games. its shouldn't really bother woolie. its more for mechanical discussion.
[0:46:32] <+feet_hands> this just reminded me that i never actually finished this game lmao
[0:46:32] <+Rekinsinn> is this the old save or a new one?
[0:46:35] <bear_breaker20> that move fucks
[0:46:36] <@Solidus_113> old
[0:46:37] <Timarkot> @munitalprats consumables i mean
[0:46:40] <nutimik> you can pop a money bag and buy some spirit emblems, you can always farm for money quite easily later
[0:46:47] <+Tucker0603> aggressively defensive. you don't have to worry about people attacking you if you stab them in the throat before they can act
[0:46:51] <andre11dr> If Woolie specced into magic this will be easier
[0:47:01] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @feet_hands
[0:47:03] <+Gallhint> what are those doodads on the ground?
[0:47:07] <+feet_hands> sorry moobot
[0:47:11] <+krispen_wa> why doesnt woolie simply summon a phantom or two
[0:47:13] <Johannen> You absolutly can
[0:47:20] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:47:21] <dizimous> Based
[0:47:22] <ullyzeez> new update its ghosts @gallhint
[0:47:29] <%Lion_kun> If you have gold, just use it and buy some.
[0:47:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> NO SNEAK OWL FIGHT LETS GO
[0:47:37] <Raldavar> Just summon like 90% lf streamers am I right?
[0:47:37] <Protologo> people keep saying "don't be passive" but aren't explaing where tge opportunities are. it's not helpful
[0:47:42] <Coystick> I always unbound crouch for boss fights, it's so silly
[0:47:42] <+Gallhint> @ullyzeez yo i forgot it got updated! thanks!
[0:47:47] <nutimik> why doesn't Owl as the biggest ninja, just eat the others?
[0:47:50] <andre11dr> Just spam Dark Bead and you'll win ez
[0:47:53] <Gelphaze> Didn't think we would finish this.
[0:47:53] <Johannen> @Protologo Everything is an oportunity
[0:48:01] <munitalprats> @Protologo literally everything
[0:48:02] <EX_shuffle> Simply perfectly react to everything
[0:48:04] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Protologo You just attack. That's it
[0:48:05] <munitalprats> whenever hes not attacking
[0:48:11] <%jiggy_snipe> boy, Sajam's recent streams about chat advice are applicable right now LUL
[0:48:12] <+yukichocomilk> let him learn through the fight instead of reading backseaters. if you're impatient watching go do something else
[0:48:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Protologo Literally. If you attack the boss will deflect and not attack themselves
[0:48:26] <Psyramics> yeah, I loved this fight cause he had so many openings. It felt so good learning him
[0:48:28] <%he1lhydra> sajamSegue3
[0:48:30] <dinnydanny777> Why is Owl so big limesHmm
[0:48:35] <+Grayhammatter> nice use of double ichimonji
[0:48:35] <+pat_cchan> yeah guys nothing you say is gonna win him the fight, its learning time
[0:48:48] <dizimous> Ya you can attack for free a lot on this game, you can definitely over extend but ya
[0:48:49] <+krispen_wa> Why does he call himself the Owl if he is a man? he lies.
[0:48:53] <%Juriasu> I mean yeah we all had to do this probably against this boss even
[0:48:54] <Lobster_Lord> People are too sensitive about chat. We are watching a dude play video games. Of course people are gonna say some dumb shit sometimes.
[0:48:59] <Johannen> @yukichocomilk Well you see, this is not a specific Boss thing, its a mechanic for the whole game
[0:49:03] <%Seancicle> 🙊
[0:49:10] <+Tucker0603> @krispen_wa that's his fursona Kappa
[0:49:11] <munitalprats> This will plague him the entire game
[0:49:16] <%fullmetalheartx> I found this fight to be easier by being extremely aggressive and the getting the deflecting down
[0:49:18] <munitalprats> but hey, it'll be funny :^)
[0:49:20] <vVAstrAVv> pls attack woolie a long fight isnt in your favor <3
[0:49:25] <skyentombment> Hey, guys, does anyone know why there's the no shouting rule here?
[0:49:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Did he just I-frame the stink gas?
[0:49:33] <Peyote_> One opportunity is to try and attack him when he throws the green ball
[0:49:37] <+krispen_wa> It cant Plague him for the whole game. Plague cant play games faster than Dark Souls 1
[0:49:40] <Fareflight_> @dinnydanny777 Probably because Sekiro sees him that way. He's Sekrio's father so he probably sees him as a legend and larger than life.
[0:49:40] <Kohei_kyouji> @fullmetalheartx thats basically the whole game
[0:49:40] <+LeaIsChill> YEP
[0:49:41] <dinnydanny777> Can Owl twist his neck all the way around? limesHmm
[0:49:42] <CrimsonGargoyle> WHOA, he came back to soekiro! PridePog
[0:49:46] <NiSoKr> Guys he’s not interested in playing aggressive. You can beat the game like this so whatever
[0:49:46] <+feet_hands> man we really do got some experts in here huh?? LUL

[0:49:58] <EX_shuffle> Objects break the lockon sometimes
[0:49:58] <T_Sasquatch> yup
[0:50:04] <nutimik> chat, attacking Owl when his HP is >50% is pointless.
[0:50:04] <%Tearonex> that's fine, keep at it
[0:50:05] <+Grayhammatter> that damn door
[0:50:07] <+RyTYoung> yah that'll happen

[0:50:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Kappa Kappa
[0:50:20] <Psyramics> you reduce his hp by attacking...
[0:50:21] <munitalprats> @nutimik he's not doing it period
[0:50:22] <Ashenik1> in Machinegun Saint fight is being agressive optimal play?
[0:50:22] <skyentombment> X2Eliah Ah , I see it. Thanks!
[0:50:30] <+RyTYoung> @coystick same BibleThump

[0:50:53] <Fareflight_> @Ashenik1 In almost every fight that isn't Owl being aggressive is the play.
[0:50:56] <+krispen_wa> Try using a M1911 against him Woolie
[0:50:57] <dizimous> @nutimik It can generate more opportunities and keep his posture from recovering
[0:50:59] <OblivionSword1> Chat can you all just RELAX with your backseating
[0:51:00] <+chiazam> what happens if you touch those remnants?
[0:51:17] <JayCue_yt> the curse of souls streaming

[0:51:33] <Flare3500> I will never get tired of the sounds of the sword CLANGS
[0:51:35] <T_Sasquatch> ;@OblivionSword1 no :)
[0:51:35] <%X2Eliah> So, without knowing this myself, I gotta ask - doesn't aggressively attacking nonstop have some sort of staminadrain, or boss countering, or similar stuff that prevents you from mashing the attack nonstop?
[0:51:43] <nutimik> @dizimous when at high health it's not worth it because the posture just drops down immediately anyway, better to play it safe
[0:51:44] <Kohei_kyouji> no stamina drain
[0:51:44] <ullyzeez> Hey minh tell woolie chat thinks he sucks
[0:51:45] <+LeaIsChill> Sekiro has no stamina bar
[0:51:45] <munitalprats> @X2Eliah there is no stamina
[0:51:46] <+krispen_wa> lol theres no stamina in sekiro
[0:51:47] <%Mrthefro> Minh lives and Sekiro is back dangPogU
[0:51:50] <stormhawk9891> @x2eliah nope
[0:51:58] <munitalprats> posture will not drain as fast, thats it.
[0:52:02] <netrac> @X2Eliah The boss will automatically counter after a couple of hits
[0:52:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @X2Eliah NOPE thats the game
[0:52:03] <%Josef_Stryker> Nah the game encourages you play aggressively
[0:52:04] <Peyote_> If they deflect your attack they can attack you
[0:52:09] <%Juriasu> @X2Eliah the boss will start to parry back but there is a distinct sound when he does
[0:52:09] <dizimous> @nutimik Eh, fair enough
[0:52:15] <munitalprats> the game encourages you to attack after parrying back
[0:52:15] <+Gallhint> its best to back off and hold guard if you really need the posture back, but otherwise GET IN AND RIP ASS
[0:52:20] <%Josef_Stryker> The combat in this game should be treated like something of a dance between two swordsman
[0:52:26] <Gelphaze> Yea stop back seatgaming, relax Woolie got this.
[0:52:26] <NiSoKr> Imagine  Sekiro as a single player fighting game. As long as you’re plus you can do whatever you want
[0:52:30] <dinnydanny777> @x2eliah I think they start to block or attack you back, kind of like a revenge value I guess
[0:52:31] <nutimik> and yeah if they parry a couple of your attacks in a row they often get a free hit in on you
[0:52:32] <JayCue_yt> streaming souls is like driving a clown car station wagon and everybody is in the back seat
[0:52:33] <Johannen> @X2Eliah You keep attacking until they start to block you or trying to do un unblockable attack, in which case you react
[0:52:34] <Lobster_Lord> @X2Eliah boss will deflect you after a while, but the sound que is obvious and is your signal to back off and block/parry
[0:52:36] <+feet_hands> BACKSEATERS OUT
[0:52:38] <JetpackMcQuack> lock in
[0:52:44] <%X2Eliah> oki... thnx
[0:52:45] <andre11dr> Quick Woolie, switch to Swordmaster ,that should work
[0:52:48] <Indigo_Automaton> SICK
[0:52:49] <+krispen_wa> USE YOKAI FORM WOOLIE
[0:52:50] <winner_92> @JayCue_yt lmfao aint that the truest thing ill read all day
[0:52:50] <pennykettle_> lets fucking go
[0:52:51] <+matteasy31> LETS GO WOOLIE
[0:52:51] <Mr_216> KomodoHype
[0:52:53] <+Grayhammatter> sick
[0:52:53] <Coystick> You think they could've balanced the game around combing health and posture into one bar? Essentially only have posture, no heals, but can regen it was you would regain posture.
[0:52:54] <munitalprats> RESSURECT IS BACK
[0:52:55] <Flare3500> Clang Clang
[0:52:57] <%Tearonex> GOOD SHIT WOOLZ
[0:53:00] <vVAstrAVv> very GOOOOD
[0:53:00] <Mr_216> jiyuDaigasm Breathe
[0:53:00] <%Jetzord> YEAH WOOLIE GET HIM
[0:53:01] <Kohei_kyouji> @X2Eliah this boss in particular can counter your thrust attacks if he isnt vulnerable, but generally in this game you always want to be in front of your foe, attack and parrying. no dodging or running unless a specific move calls for it (there will be a symbol that appears on screen for those)
[0:53:02] <JetpackMcQuack> Again, he's not reading chat LUL
[0:53:04] <srv4254> hes in the zone
[0:53:05] <Flare3500> I forgot you can just pause anytime in this game
[0:53:10] <+matteasy31> PogChamp
[0:53:13] <+krispen_wa> YEYEYEYE SWORD THING
[0:53:16] <+feet_hands> this is a great attempt
[0:53:17] <ullyzeez> bruh wtf why are you breaking the flow of the game just play scrub
[0:53:19] <+matteasy31> SourPls
[0:53:22] <+Graxe_> That's one bar
[0:53:26] <JayCue_yt> SourPls
[0:53:35] <Johannen> @X2Eliah You are going back and forth with the enemy, you attack then the enemy, tug of war
[0:53:36] <+feet_hands> modz
[0:53:38] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[0:53:39] <munitalprats> yup.
[0:53:41] <Mr_216> rip
[0:53:42] <+Gallhint> stab that hand G
[0:53:42] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[0:53:42] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[0:53:48] <munitalprats> this is why i just used the shuriken for like
[0:53:49] <+LeaIsChill> @ullyzeez No strategy just attack 4Head
[0:53:50] <munitalprats> 99% of the game
[0:53:56] <munitalprats> and the flamevent for certain enemies with oil
[0:54:00] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I forget, does this boss have a third phase?
[0:54:01] <ullyzeez> you can still use it without emblems iirc
[0:54:02] <T_Sasquatch> fuck emblems
[0:54:07] <andre11dr> It be like that sometimes
[0:54:13] <Kohei_kyouji> @Freakin_Wolfy i dont think so
[0:54:14] <+Gallhint> @Freakin_Wolfy technically
[0:54:15] <dizimous> I wish you got a minimum for emblems when you spawn, like Elixirs in Nioh
[0:54:15] <mr_saturday93> divine grass helps alot
[0:54:23] <NiSoKr> It does less damage without emblems iirc
[0:54:23] <%zanzibar_junker> The emblem system is shit
[0:54:23] <Lobster_Lord> Sekiro really filtered a lot of souls players huh. Its a beautiful throwback to early days of souls.
[0:54:26] <Flare3500> Go full Katy Perry and make them Fireworks
[0:54:26] <+feet_hands> minh is the only one allowed to backseat LUL
[0:54:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh encouraging him to cycle items will literally get woolie murdered lol
[0:54:44] <dinnydanny777> All this talk about back seating made me think of a boy band called the Backseat Boys
[0:54:47] <Pookiedaexzile> I hope the guy that made your specials consumable items got fired
[0:54:48] <+krispen_wa> USE THE UBUME SOUL CORE
[0:54:54] <+krispen_wa> IT DRAINS STAMINA
[0:54:58] <%Josef_Stryker> Yeah this game really fucks up Souls vets because the expect just more Souls but with jumping when that's far from the case
[0:55:10] <Coystick> Fuck it reinstalling Sekibrekki
[0:55:19] <Timothyer> !mod
[0:55:19] <brian_peppers1> Try pressing R1 Woolie I heard that works sometimes
[0:55:23] <moeartifact> the best advice i had for anyone playing this game was "don't play it like dark souls. it's not dark souls"
[0:55:24] <+LeaIsChill> That's what it's made for, yes
[0:55:30] <+feet_hands> close eyes, press button
[0:55:37] <lioxor> Iirc  mortal draw without emblems just losses  some range rigth?
[0:55:40] <Jaxnos> that poison on the floor be lasting for days
[0:55:44] <Klefth> The only advice I'd give him now is to punish that little poison ball. Iirc you can dodge to the side and sneak a hit in every time
[0:55:44] <T_Sasquatch> i dont like sekiro's game design but its combat is phenomenal
[0:55:45] <andre11dr> Just hit him and you'll win bruh
[0:55:47] <Johannen> @Josef_Stryker Not only Souls veterans but also general actiion players like Woolie who want to dodge and jump
[0:55:51] <%zanzibar_junker> Use Kasha/Yomi/Yasha for soulcores
[0:55:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie be like "I'm going to play this exactly like Dark Souls."
[0:56:03] <ulcaban> Does he deliberately do the anitheal on himself, in case you rush in?
[0:56:11] <jetjagger222> playing it like nioh will get you killed extra faster compared to playing it like souls
[0:56:11] <Jaxnos> it loses strength too, but it still hits rather hard from what i remember
[0:56:11] <+matteasy31> ONE TWO
[0:56:13] <+LeaIsChill> Jump habits be like that LUL
[0:56:14] <T_Sasquatch> if woolie can play nioh he should have zero problem with sekiro imo
[0:56:16] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackScared
[0:56:19] <Lobera64> If woolie gets in more he’ll have an easier time
[0:56:19] <Kohei_kyouji> @Johannen yeah the jumping especially is very jarring to see...and it never gets any better
[0:56:25] <mr_saturday93> Perfect! Youknowwhatimean, raise your sword
[0:56:28] <Jaxnos> and is a good go to to break stun an enemy
[0:56:29] <srv4254> nioh and sekiro are totally different
[0:56:37] <+krispen_wa> Yeah, nioh is way better
[0:56:38] <+feet_hands> BOISON monkaW
[0:56:41] <jetjagger222> yeah ki pulse turns nioh into character action
[0:56:42] <dinnydanny777> you got this limesOk
[0:56:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> speed
[0:56:45] <winner_92> i believe that Woolie Will Figure It Out
[0:56:46] <Johannen> I switched my jump and dodge cause its actually way easier to play that way
[0:56:46] <@Menitta> Nioh and Sekiro dont have that much overlap
[0:56:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Hey on the bright side Woolie's awful jumping habit will actually be really useful when he fights DoH lmao
[0:56:49] <SenpaiMD> nioh is a different skillset
[0:56:53] <scrublordsamurai> i love nioh but can't stand sekiro its strange even to me
[0:56:54] <+matteasy31> BOISON WINS
[0:56:57] <andre11dr> Damn why can't i get a Fromsoft fighting game?
[0:56:58] <+Gallhint> sometimes a dodge can be even better than a perfect block because you can get a couple licks in
[0:57:00] <ullyzeez> woolie playing too passively smh
[0:57:02] <Lobera64> I love nioh and sekiro
[0:57:05] <vVAstrAVv> come on shield hero
[0:57:06] <Lobster_Lord> @krispen_wa its not about one being "better" than the other. they are both really different.
[0:57:09] <Coystick> Woolie brain go hurt
[0:57:10] <+matteasy31> LUL
[0:57:11] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:57:14] <%X2Eliah> What should he do instead of jumping?
[0:57:14] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:57:14] <theDromader> I preffer Sekiro's hyper-focused approach personally.
[0:57:14] <%Josef_Stryker> @TheRealGreaterGamer God fuck that boss. Makes you have to forget everything u know and play it like Souls
[0:57:17] <+krispen_wa> Yeah and one is really different because its better
[0:57:17] <Mr_216> atpRtsd
[0:57:18] <+FuqBoiSlim> I think they're both neat games :)
[0:57:19] <Lobera64> Woolie needs to clash swords with owl
[0:57:20] <+mechslayer71> Nioh and Sekiro are very different so
[0:57:27] <Coystick> Nah never plan for failure
[0:57:29] <Flare3500> Sekiro is the better game Nioh just sucks in general
[0:57:30] <+LeaIsChill> Yeah Woolie hasn't spoken in like 10 minutes, he's focused LUL
[0:57:32] <jetjagger222> @FuqBoiSlim agreed, they rub very different itches
[0:57:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Josef_Stryker which is why its a great boss fite me
[0:57:39] <Lobster_Lord> @krispen_wa i mean you are free to like one over the other.
[0:57:40] <munitalprats> no its on your bar already
[0:57:42] <+matteasy31> Woolie is dialed in right now
[0:57:43] <+KillMyPast> the panic
[0:57:43] <Coystick> Legit, planning for failure is mind poison in vidya
[0:57:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Lock out and relock in playing the game how its asking you to play it
[0:57:49] <+feet_hands> nioh 1 was kinda lackluster but i enjoyed the 2nd one a lot
[0:57:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[0:57:49] <+mechslayer71> @x2eliah just dodge normally,
[0:57:52] <ullyzeez> he gonna get hit as soon as he closes
[0:57:52] <brunoberserk> 100%  F O C U S
[0:57:55] <Kohei_kyouji> id like nioh more if it werent for all the loot and menuing
[0:58:01] <%sporeian94> @ullyzeez oh most defiantely
[0:58:02] <+rando848> the gourd doesnt heal the poison though
[0:58:03] <+feet_hands> nioh loot is very annoying
[0:58:06] <Gelphaze> Nice and smooth Nice and smooth
[0:58:06] <andre11dr> Chat your clearly getting trolled, can't you really not see it LUL
[0:58:08] <nutimik> don't forget you can use items in your inventory
[0:58:13] <Flare3500> Nioh is so bad neither Pat or Woolie finished it
[0:58:15] <Johannen> @X2Eliah Or block instead of jumping
[0:58:20] <%Lion_kun> Gourd doesn't heal poison
[0:58:20] <Coystick> I only ever keep two items in my hotbar
[0:58:22] <+matteasy31> Here we go
[0:58:26] <JayCue_yt> oof
[0:58:28] <+LeaIsChill> Nioh never won Game of the Year Kappa
[0:58:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> IT JUST DID LMAO
[0:58:29] <Lobera64> I want to get nioh 2
[0:58:32] <%Lion_kun> It gives poison resistance.
[0:58:35] <%paladinstarbuster> never get more than one of those huh?
[0:58:36] <munitalprats> no h'e still poisoned @TheRealGreaterGamer
[0:58:43] <srv4254> if u watched pat play nioh 2 u would know why they never streamed it
[0:58:44] <+krispen_wa> Nioh 2 gave me me so many inventory mindgoblins that it looped around and made me love it
[0:58:45] <+matteasy31> SourPls
[0:58:47] <%LazerRaptor15> LazerRaptor15 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:58:48] <%Lion_kun> If you're poisoned, you need an antidote.
[0:58:55] <%X2Eliah> @srv4254 why?
[0:58:57] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Oh I cant see the symbol lol bc of the facecam
[0:59:05] <%zanzibar_junker> Sekiro has no dash cancels
[0:59:06] <turbofolk> !commands
[0:59:06] <Coystick> Positioning matters baby
[0:59:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:59:08] <PlumpPotatoRump> "fuckin' camera' for real man
[0:59:08] <Kohei_kyouji> @X2Eliah he should for sure be blocking instead of jumping. the longer youre away fromt he enemy the more stamina they get back.
[0:59:10] <T_Sasquatch> @Flare3500 i wouldnt say bad but the people that make ninja gaiden like to violate players
[0:59:20] <%Parapattern> Is Woolie starting to regret his words and deeds yet?
[0:59:24] <turbofolk> !uptime
[0:59:24] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 59 minutes and 35 seconds
[0:59:25] <Coystick> BACK against the wall is a bad place to be
[0:59:28] <srv4254> second optional enemy dunked him for an hour
[0:59:28] <Johannen> Does anyone know if you can turn of those Remnants?
[0:59:30] <JayCue_yt> I wanna hear, like, a droning doom metal cover of this boss theme
[0:59:37] <%sporeian94> Man Wollie is way oo defensive
[0:59:39] <munitalprats> letting his posture decrease
[0:59:42] <munitalprats> way too much
[0:59:51] <munitalprats> but hey, its how he wants to play
[0:59:55] <scrublordsamurai> all my irl friends who played sekiro gave up on it i just didnt like the restrictiveness of it, nioh buildwise is much more open and gives you tones of options and playstyles
[0:59:58] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I haven't seen any ohter attempts on this boss. Has he tried the mindless aggression strategy?
[0:59:59] <%SainEdge> @Johannen yes you can
[1:00:05] <Lobera64> Woolie is playing this fight too far from owl
[1:00:09] <+krispen_wa> Just use a Call Beyond, it'll destroy his health bar
[1:00:10] <Johannen> Woolie is using Passive Fist Way of the HP
[1:00:12] <Klefth> He's so wide open whenever he drops that little poison bomb
[1:00:12] <%X2Eliah> So for these really long, tough boss fights that the game expects you to run many times, it would be great if the game cycled through several music tracks
[1:00:13] <Jaxnos> dad has so much stink juice and fart gas on him
[1:00:15] <+feet_hands> why arent there mods in here timing out complainers
[1:00:18] <Coystick> I swear Owl had more moves than he's doing
[1:00:19] <%Deekman> when he does his smoke bomb why not just to an ichimonji double? he doesn't leave his cloud
[1:00:19] <+Gallhint> I think its almost instinct for most players to play very defensively when they first do sekiro
[1:00:20] <dinnydanny777> Owl just carries gallons of poison in his pockets
[1:00:22] <+DappercatEsquire> if i remember right, can't you get a hit in by circling after the heal block?
[1:00:24] <+poto2222> Wait, when did he start this playthrough?
[1:00:32] <+krispen_wa> a year and a half ago

[1:00:33] <+Gallhint> it really takes an eye opener to make you break through and become aggressive
[1:00:35] <+LeaIsChill> @Coystick That's because this is First Owl. Owl Father is different
[1:00:37] <+chiazam> You can totally attack him after he throes the charm
[1:00:37] <Johannen> @poto2222 in 2019
[1:00:46] <+matteasy31> PauseChamp
[1:00:49] <andre11dr> @coystick Maybe you're thinking of latter
[1:00:51] <+FuqBoiSlim> I've learned from the Bloodborne LP that we just gotta let him find his own way MGTOW-style
[1:00:53] <+poto2222> Ooooh, big hiatus, I see. thanks!
[1:00:58] <Kohei_kyouji> @X2Eliah in this game the lower an enemys hp, the slower their stamina regens. at this point owl would die super easy if woolie just parried a bunch (parrying is mostly how you stagger enemies in this for an instant kill)
[1:01:00] <Jaxnos> that's fine, go for the health kill
[1:01:06] <+Gallhint> all things considered, for taking such a break, hes doing REALLY well
[1:01:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Heath kill it is lol who could have guessed
[1:01:10] <biggdaddymike> Come on, almost there
[1:01:20] <+krispen_wa> Woolie played Bloodborne as Snail Souls, people thinking he would do this any different are fooling themselves
[1:01:21] <pennykettle_> hes got it
[1:01:21] <Equirah> why is woolie using the wrong move for phase 2? it's still better with no paper
[1:01:21] <+matteasy31> Owl got a warehouse in his pocket LUL
[1:01:23] <+feet_hands> @Lobster_Lord backseating is one thing but berating a streamer for how they play a game is bannable imo
[1:01:24] <+Freakin_Wolfy> What are those things on the ground? I've never seen them before
[1:01:25] <Coystick> @andre11dr @LeaIsChill that explains everything
[1:01:25] <+mechslayer71> Watching this really makes you realize Woolie so good at fighting games because he’s been playing them for like 3 decades, not because of any innate talent
[1:01:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Owl out grinding emblems
[1:01:30] <elpennacho> sekiro more like MIDkiro
[1:01:32] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[1:01:32] <+Tuffty> GET THAT ASS WOOLIE
[1:01:32] <winner_92> owl got pockets just STUFFED with spirit emblems
[1:01:33] <+mechslayer71> Is good*
[1:01:34] <OldManDeckardCain> they are the "boss" for a reason LUL
[1:01:36] <Gelphaze> I didn't know he could do that?
[1:01:40] <+coldsama> I remembered this boss made me scared of using Thrust moves
[1:01:40] <+chiazam> Get Greedy
[1:01:41] <%Exiliator> nice
[1:01:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> time for greeed
[1:01:51] <Flare3500> Stab him woolie stab him
[1:01:51] <3Xgilly> big poison swig
[1:01:52] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp
[1:01:53] <+LeaIsChill> Health kill would actually be PogChamp
[1:01:54] <vVAstrAVv> you can rez GREED
[1:01:55] <+Grayhammatter> get that ass woolie
[1:01:58] <bear_breaker20> GET GREEDAY
[1:01:58] <biggdaddymike> Choke incoming
[1:02:01] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @coldsama Luckily woolie doesnt use any moves
[1:02:01] <%paladinstarbuster> get in there
[1:02:01] <pennykettle_> gg
[1:02:03] <EmptyFist> Greed or die
[1:02:05] <dinnydanny777> Owl has the Resident Evil item box in his pocket

[1:05:07] <+Grayhammatter> big poor
[1:05:09] <%X2Eliah> Ohh wait this isn't a fantasy setting, it's just actual Japan?
[1:05:12] <winner_92> @JetpackMcQuack souls game twitch chats are Endless Backseating
[1:05:13] <+Gallhint> I'd say half of the backseating is in good nature just wanting to help
[1:05:13] <andre11dr> But wat happens if a gurl One Guys, is that One Girl?
[1:05:18] <+Gallhint> but it gets toxic quickly
[1:05:18] <+loukemia83> only thing to do when you're poor is murder some dudes
[1:05:18] <+brickwall35> chat, what's something about this game that I can bitch at Woolie for doing "wrong"?
[1:05:19] <%X2Eliah> And called "Japan" ingame?
[1:05:19] <OldManDeckardCain> if you think this chat is toxic, you haven't seen toxic LUZL
[1:05:20] <Psyramics> its fantasy japan
[1:05:21] <Johannen> @pennykettle_ Knowing how Woolie tresures Thugery in fighting games, i dunno if this is even toxic by those standarts
[1:05:21] <%X2Eliah> huh
[1:05:23] <Professor_Rakor> All for One Guy
[1:05:25] <+krispen_wa> Its fantasy NOT-Japan
[1:05:33] <Flare3500> EAT THE SUGAR GET DIABETES
[1:05:35] <IchigoY24> @WoolieVersus finish that xp bar
[1:05:35] <NiSoKr> Has Woolie ever seen someone else play Sekiro?
[1:05:36] <+Grayhammatter> heavy coin purse?
[1:05:37] <+mechslayer71> @brickwall35 most of that fight just now
[1:05:38] <Indigo_Automaton> You do
[1:05:39] <JayCue_yt> Is there a cultural significance for the word "ambition" in JP? I remember there being a game called "Nobunaga's Ambition"
[1:05:39] <Pookiedaexzile> One for All Guy
[1:05:45] <munitalprats> @pennykettle_ this isnt toxic, this is for the rest of the game
[1:05:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @X2Eliah Yup, actual Japan. With mythological inspirations
[1:05:47] <+matteasy31> Let's gooooo
[1:05:48] <tuxedosaiyan> woolieVS
[1:05:49] <Lobster_Lord> The word toxic has lost all meaning
[1:05:51] <Coystick> time for shitkid
[1:05:51] <Ashenik1> Its historical Japan with big snakes
[1:05:51] <disflipmat> It's sengoku era japan with magic

[1:06:09] <+krispen_wa> SUMANAI
[1:06:13] <%jiggy_snipe> toxic isn't the word, more like mad annoying

[1:06:24] <T_Sasquatch> Backseating is a funny concept because if the person was playing well people wouldn't be backseating
[1:06:29] <vVAstrAVv> this next boss is my arch nemesis
[1:06:35] <Jaxnos> that's a huge lie, sasquatch
[1:06:37] <Indigo_Automaton> Young Master!
[1:06:42] <vVAstrAVv> fuck their red prompts
[1:06:44] <EX_shuffle> Actual battles that actually took place in ancient japan
[1:06:50] <PlumpPotatoRump> @T_Sasquatch That's not completely true. And even then what is "Playing well." ?
[1:06:59] <Lobster_Lord> Backseating is a funny concept because we are literally just watching a dude play video games. What else would chat talk about?
[1:07:01] <%ekodrop> delicious raw rice
[1:07:03] <Flare3500> I've got all the McGuffin whats next
[1:07:10] <munitalprats> pretty much
[1:07:12] <+Gallhint> I wish I had a cool royal little bro with magic blood
[1:07:13] <munitalprats> what are we gonna talk about
[1:07:13] <%ThisIsLloyd> people are cool with backseating until it's them getting ragged on infront of a couple hundred people
[1:07:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> nandato
[1:07:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nani
[1:07:20] <IchigoY24> woolie seems like he has post nut depression :(
[1:07:22] <%ThisIsLloyd> for like, years
[1:07:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Lobster_Lord Any good anime you've watched lately?
[1:07:24] <munitalprats> this is **the place to talk about the videogame that woolie is playing**
[1:07:25] <+krispen_wa> If Woolie actually upgraded his Rakuyo, this wouldnt be a problem
[1:07:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> "P
[1:07:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> :P
[1:07:30] <Jaxnos> backseating happens in freaking pro league chat
[1:07:32] <%X2Eliah> WAIT SO THEY DID ALL THAT FOR PERFUME??
[1:07:34] <linSP> Is fountainhead a translation thing
[1:07:40] <CraZ80> @Lobster_Lord politics Kappa
[1:07:41] <T_Sasquatch> @PlumpPotatoRump not dying repeatedly. I guess people seem someone fail multiple times and want to help
[1:07:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Burn It
[1:07:46] <dinnydanny777> Flowery clothes limesO limesComfy
[1:07:48] <Coystick> rub that fountainhead stank on good boi
[1:07:49] <srv4254> it smells really good tho
[1:07:54] <@akuda_bar> backseating isn't always a bad thing but it's bad when someone's like "if the streamer doesn't do what i want, ima be a dick"
[1:07:54] <Jontman42> Kuro is precious
[1:07:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @X2Eliah MAGIC perfume
[1:07:57] <Jaxnos> there's people that would backseat Daigo if they got the chance
[1:07:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> chat sounds like a fun person to hang out with at parties, totally
[1:07:59] <Lobster_Lord> Backseating will forever be apart of the Twitch/Streaming experience.
[1:08:07] <NiSoKr> Oh he already got the dry fruit
[1:08:10] <vVAstrAVv> its magic warp perfume dont worry
[1:08:10] <%jiggy_snipe> @T_Sasquatch that's fine but when someone doesn't want your help, maybe stop offering it?
[1:08:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> HA
[1:08:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> ANIMATING IS HARD
[1:08:23] <+matteasy31> LUL
[1:08:27] <dinnydanny777> And then we get the MYSTERY of what did he do? limesSmug
[1:08:27] <+LeaIsChill> Chest????
[1:08:28] <Indigo_Automaton> At least they finally have lipsyncing
[1:08:28] <+matteasy31> Fade to black baby
[1:08:28] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL LUL
[1:08:30] <DatAsuna> yeah lowkey this kinda thing really lowers my expectations for elden ring
[1:08:31] <Coystick> Sliced open his nips for justice
[1:08:31] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[1:08:32] <PlumpPotatoRump> @T_Sasquatch Fair point, but what if someone is simply make mistakes because they're stressed or learning what to do, and if that "helping" is actively taking away from the streamers experience? Or that of other ppl in chat.
[1:08:32] <Flare3500> Hey man they've been using that door animation opening for years don't you hate on them
[1:08:34] <saraizarai> how do you make a small cut on ones chest
[1:08:35] <T_Sasquatch> @jiggy_snipe yea totally but did woolie say no backseating ?
[1:08:40] <JetpackMcQuack> It healed immediadly, the clothes too it was crazy
[1:08:42] <Ashenik1> oh yeah no lips animations LUL
[1:08:42] <samuelfisk> Invisible children
[1:08:46] <%Juriasu> @akuda_bar in this case I think most of us in chat whether they are backseating or not just want Woolie to have fun with the game, and the way he is playing is kind of leading to it not being that
[1:08:46] <%X2Eliah> ??
[1:08:49] <DatAsuna> Cause I really hoped not being a souls game meant less jank quest scripting like this
[1:08:49] <+krispen_wa> Shoulda just hired Bluepoint for Elden Ring animations
[1:08:50] <pennykettle_> nah you're wrong, watch the game get datamined and Kuro has 3 cut animations for what he just did
[1:08:50] <SixthSun2> Still is
[1:08:51] <Solidnick18> huh
[1:08:58] <ronin19xx> Here comes homer
[1:08:58] <Coystick> Disease Critic
[1:08:58] <+LeaIsChill> It is! Look at Kingdom Hearts Kappa
[1:08:59] <%sporeian94> Sciene use to be weird
[1:08:59] <JetpackMcQuack> now it's culture
[1:09:00] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> So was homosexuality.
[1:09:03] <@akuda_bar> @Juriasu eh. you can be concerned without being hostile
[1:09:03] <Jontman42> pretty sure the meaning of "nostalgia" was also different a couple centuries ago
[1:09:03] <+Gallhint> abandon the past, embrace the future
[1:09:03] <%jonblnt> some still considers it that
[1:09:06] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> So the past is dumb.
[1:09:07] <Flare3500> Everything is a disease
[1:09:09] <T_Sasquatch> @PlumpPotatoRump im not defending people i just get why they do it
[1:09:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WTF
[1:09:11] <%sporeian94> Like Corn flakes were made to make people stop masturbating
[1:09:14] <%Juriasu> @akuda_bar yeah for sure
[1:09:15] <nutimik> anyone who says From should hire Bluepoint for anything needs a kick in the ass
[1:09:20] <Clundy> Humans are the disease maaaaaaaan
[1:09:28] <T_Sasquatch> @sporeian94 how ... would that even work
[1:09:29] <+krispen_wa> Nostalgia is a disease. Let the past die. kill it if you have to
[1:09:29] <+mechslayer71> And smoking used to be considered healthy. The point?
[1:09:30] <%TheLastStar> Imma need that tidbit explained
[1:09:32] <linSP> I can’t imagine from doing no lips movement after blupoints work
[1:09:33] <Lobster_Lord> @sporeian94 based kellogs helping the no nut effort
[1:09:34] <ulcaban> Macguffin Junction
[1:09:35] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Man I sure feel nostalgic for back when nostalgia was a disease. Take me back.
[1:09:39] <Indigo_Automaton> YEYEYE We're going to the palace
[1:09:40] <pennykettle_> @mechslayer71 just a fun fact
[1:09:41] <Johannen> I will take subtle mouth animation over whatever the Demon Souls Remake makes NPCs do with thier faces
[1:09:42] <PlumpPotatoRump> @T_Sasquatch Sorry if came off agressive, I was legit asking a question xD, Either way, I hope you're enjoying the stream ^^
[1:09:42] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp the real sekiro starts here
[1:09:42] <Afrosamasenpai> Why masturbate when you can eat some cornflakes
[1:09:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Bluepoint can animate, but they do not get to touch the designs anymore
[1:09:48] <Coystick> Doctor makes me eat corn flakes to stop me watching Nostalgia Critic.
[1:09:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> I WANTED MY TENCHU GAME FROMSOFT
[1:09:55] <Ashenik1> Boomer Genocide?
[1:09:56] <%sporeian94> @T_Sasquatch John Kellog was fucking crazy. Like no fun allowed
[1:10:02] <ulcaban> The fart of the dragon
[1:10:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHERE IS MY TENCHU
[1:10:03] <primaryfire> it doesn't reload the area unless you rest
[1:10:07] <+krispen_wa> Thats why i specifically said animations. Let From do the actual art
[1:10:12] <Aydarkzero> @sonofthedeepsouth we have tenchu at home Kappa
[1:10:13] <Lobster_Lord> nostalgia critic confirmed to be disease ridden.
[1:10:15] <theDromader> I hope we get a Tenchu one day :(
[1:10:21] <T_Sasquatch> @PlumpPotatoRump no p , you too wubbyExcite
[1:10:23] <NiSoKr> The overhear he’s looking for is at sculptors hut
[1:10:28] <DatAsuna> Me too but tenchu is dead
[1:10:30] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro is shittier Tenchu because you cant play as Ayame
[1:10:33] <Afroperonista> didn't give a shit LUL
[1:10:33] <Aydarkzero> whats happening with nostalgia critic?
[1:10:41] <andre11dr> @thedromader This kind is Tenchu
[1:10:46] <srv4254> he ate a fistful of maggots
[1:10:51] <DatAsuna> Sekiro is shittier tenchu because you can't poison people and stealth out unseen
[1:10:52] <+matteasy31> Yeah I forgot about the shortcut LUL
[1:10:52] <bear_breaker20> guys sekiro has the little lord shut up
[1:11:00] <winner_92> the most useless secret passage ever because you can just warp LUL
[1:11:12] <Lobster_Lord> @Aydarkzero he caught the ligma
[1:11:14] <jetjagger222> its a ninja door though
[1:11:18] <+matteasy31> Doesn't matter Woolie got the PS5 now LUL
[1:11:19] <Coystick> Warping ruins fucking everything
[1:11:19] <Johannen> @winner_92 Makes for a cool world building
[1:11:20] <theDromader> I guess what Im craving is a true Ninja-stealth game. This was great but much more combat-focused
[1:11:20] <DatAsuna> The people who screamed at us at launch to not call it souls and only look at it as new tenchu really set up the worst possible framing for this game
[1:11:21] <DianaTheAscian> well not anymore
[1:11:22] <Indigo_Automaton> Yeah it's a little redundant
[1:11:23] <+LeaIsChill> Sekiro isn't fun Kappa
[1:11:28] <%LastHazzerd> during the ninja raid that spawns owl, a lot of idols and that path get closed off again
[1:11:28] <Aydarkzero> @Lobster_Lord ha Kappa
[1:11:32] <DatAsuna> Cause Sekiro is a decent souls successor and a dogshit tenchu successor
[1:11:40] <Aydarkzero> if Tenchu is so good how come it doesn't have any new games Kappa
[1:11:44] <+krispen_wa> sekiro isnt even close to a souls successor
[1:11:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, i forgot this chart
[1:11:45] <+yukichocomilk> this is a souls game
[1:11:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> abelincoln_catpuncher subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Woolie! glad to see your back at it with Sekiro, parry a dog for me, it's the most ridiculous concept but I love it #pupperparries
[1:11:47] <+Tuffty> The worst upgrade tree
[1:11:48] <+krispen_wa> its shit at both
[1:11:52] <winner_92> @Johannen kinda, it mostly makes me think about how the hell the map works tho
[1:11:56] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Sculptor be like "hey good for you for not being an asshole, I totally was"
[1:11:56] <Flare3500> I like the umbrella
[1:11:57] <EX_shuffle> It's there to explain how Emma gets around
[1:11:58] <jetjagger222> sekiro is a sword of the stranger simulator
[1:11:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:12:02] <T_Sasquatch> sekiro needs the equivalent of the ds3 overhaul mod
[1:12:10] <JetpackMcQuack> yup
[1:12:14] <primaryfire> every tool has its use, just gotta find it
[1:12:16] <theDromader> What we really need is more Shinobido
[1:12:17] <Lobster_Lord> Elden Ring will feel weird without the grapple hook.
[1:12:20] <pennykettle_> a sekiro overhaul mod would be based
[1:12:21] <munitalprats> fireworks and shuriken are the best tools
[1:12:22] <DatAsuna> Tenchu was never amazing, but it always had potential, tenchu games shouldn't be about combat
[1:12:23] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro would actually need items for it to have a DS3 overhaul
[1:12:28] <+MajorCrasher> What even is Tenchu?
[1:12:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh beat the game?!
[1:12:32] <+RyTYoung> NANI
[1:12:34] <Flare3500> The tools are really style points
[1:12:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> axe and shiruken were my jam
[1:12:36] <linSP> any of the blue tools are awesome but I don’t think you can get all of them in one run
[1:12:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> None of them are what I would call necessary, but the fireworks and the sabimaru did me a lot of good
[1:12:39] <saraizarai> God damnit Mihn
[1:12:42] <andre11dr> Sekiro is not a RPG it was never meant to be that, it's a stealth action game
[1:12:44] <jetjagger222> tenchu was cool but the games were always jank as fuck
[1:12:47] <brunoberserk> MINH-MAX
[1:12:47] <winner_92> you could remove literally all the tools and techniques from the game and i would like it just the same i think
[1:12:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Minh Way of the sw9rd
[1:12:48] <JetpackMcQuack> When you know what to do they expedite the process
[1:12:50] <Flare3500> Fireworks and Umbrella are fun to use
[1:12:51] <%Dante_Namikaze1> Minh is over here flexingol
[1:12:53] <nutimik> why would you do that, that just sounds less fun
[1:12:53] <NiSoKr> Shuriken is great for punishing laggy moves with big pushback
[1:12:53] <+terry_quest> fire crackers are the best
[1:12:55] <Johannen> There is some Overhaul mod for Sekiro in the works, its on Nexus i believe
[1:12:57] <+MajorCrasher> Mihn confirmed better at the game than Woolie
[1:12:57] <Ashenik1> Sekiro is a fun branch to dark souls experience
[1:12:59] <@Solidus_113> use your coin purse
[1:13:00] <+brickwall35> is this the first time Minh has been back at Woolies place?
[1:13:00] <Lobster_Lord> Can we all agree that Dark Souls 3 is the worst Souls game for being derivative and nostalgia bait?
[1:13:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> g o u r d
[1:13:07] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro should have just been a boss rush
[1:13:13] <linSP> Sekiro randomized is a fun mod
[1:13:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Lobster_Lord Better than 2
[1:13:14] <+Gallhint> sell the dragon blood droplet Kappa
[1:13:16] <EX_shuffle> No
[1:13:27] <andre11dr> @lobster_lord I like DS3 more than DS1 so no
[1:13:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Sekiro except all enemies are Isshin
[1:13:30] <winner_92> @Lobster_Lord if you have to ask "can we all agree," the answer is always no
[1:13:38] <+RyTYoung> @therealgreatergamer OH NO
[1:13:39] <Lobster_Lord> @CanadianAnimatorGuy 2 is bad, but at least i tried new shit
[1:13:41] <%jiggy_snipe> @brickwall35 yea since Quebec or maybe Canada put that guest limit
[1:13:42] <%Lion_kun> DS3 lets you heal while moving
[1:13:47] <Ashenik1> Dark Souls 3 was fun and well designed, DS2 was a total mess
[1:13:47] <Peyote_> 3 is def better than 2
[1:13:48] <jetjagger222> DS3 was the worst but DS2 felt the most awful to actually play
[1:13:49] <DatAsuna> Also the people who were trying to stoke the nioh vs sekiro arguement back then were so droll. I enjoy them for vastly different reasons.
[1:13:49] <+krispen_wa> we CAN all agree, but we MAY not
[1:13:54] <+Gallhint> @TheRealGreaterGamer so anyways i started blastin
[1:13:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> The ghost of tsushima
[1:13:59] <Lobster_Lord> it*
[1:14:03] <CraZ80> @TheRealGreaterGamer dude don't even joke about that
[1:14:08] <EX_shuffle> People really hate that ds3 is a sequel
[1:14:09] <+mechslayer71> @jetjagger222 nah 2 was the Worst
[1:14:13] <%Juriasu> whitesnake monkaS
[1:14:13] <+krispen_wa> Its so droll because nioh is so much better that its not worth discussing
[1:14:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> For his neutral special, he wields a GUN
[1:14:19] <NiSoKr> He killed the snake
[1:14:20] <Flare3500> I mean Sekiro is just the better game in general don't why people are even factoring Nioh
[1:14:22] <+nabs2099> 3 is actually pretty mediocre unlike 2 which was fantastic
[1:14:24] <jetjagger222> idk 2 expansions are really good
[1:14:25] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Check the inventory for the snake hearts to check
[1:14:28] <+RyTYoung> yah snek ded
[1:14:28] <NiSoKr> You need to for the warp powder
[1:14:29] <glass_marcus> Looks like we cannot agree on that
[1:14:29] <DianaTheAscian> don't you only get that sword if you kill it?
[1:14:30] <Professor_Rakor> You can always check key items
[1:14:30] <munitalprats> check the inventory
[1:14:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus  check your persimmons
[1:14:32] <T_Sasquatch> also if chat isnt aware theres a sekiro x  katana zero mod
[1:14:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just check inventory
[1:14:35] <munitalprats> key items
[1:14:39] <%Lion_kun> He did it.
[1:14:40] <jetjagger222> the first half of vanilla 2's core campaign was horrible though
[1:14:40] <+chiazam> Inventory
[1:14:45] <+RyTYoung> @t_sasquatch NO WAY
[1:14:46] <dizimous> @ex_shuffle Ya it's really bizarre to me
[1:14:47] <DatAsuna> Nioh is fantastic but it has so much ninja gaiden and diablo in it that it's a whole other thing
[1:14:51] <%Lion_kun> He did it already.
[1:14:56] <+Gallhint> NAISU
[1:14:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @T_Sasquatch wait what
[1:15:00] <Lobster_Lord> sekior's secret ending is so annoying to get.
[1:15:02] <+krispen_wa> if DS2 was JUST the DLC it would be better than DS3
[1:15:03] <vVAstrAVv> good job woolie
[1:15:03] <T_Sasquatch> @RyTYoung its as cool as you imagine it to be
[1:15:05] <Jaxnos> i don't wanna play DS2 ever again besides 2 of the DLC. I'd play parts of base DS3 again and especially the last DLC. majority rules in my head.
[1:15:05] <pennykettle_> LUL
[1:15:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I dont remember did Woolie kill DK?
[1:15:07] <%hologram_sam> Ya man
[1:15:08] <primaryfire> you should be able to eavesdrop on kuro now
[1:15:08] <T_Sasquatch> @cobalt_phoenix_ im not joking
[1:15:15] <%Lion_kun> Check your inventory
[1:15:15] <+RyTYoung> @t_sasquatch I need to see this!
[1:15:19] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa  yeah, especially the locations design Kappa
[1:15:36] <+nabs2099> I hope woolz will enjoy his time back, but maybe chat being assholes might prevent that.
[1:15:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> If I remember correctly didnt Woolie have the ape's reveal spoiled sadly?
[1:15:39] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ashian Depths final area
[1:15:39] <+terry_quest> go for monke
[1:15:41] <Klefth> The monk
[1:15:41] <andre11dr> So many hot takes in chat today
[1:15:43] <Flare3500> Oh yeah the Katana Zero mod on Sekiro , the creator said he would make The Dragon style with it
[1:15:43] <+penjaza> Ashina Depths?
[1:15:43] <linSP> I couldnt get into nioh because of the Minh maxing loot goblins
[1:15:46] <NiSoKr> I always forget how to unlock true shinobi
[1:15:46] <Professor_Rakor> depths
[1:15:49] <Lobera64> Ashina depths wedding door
[1:15:50] <+JonathLP> Someone: * says anything * Woolie: * THOUSAND YARD STARE CONTINUES* Ya, man. Whatever.
[1:16:03] <Lobster_Lord> I wish the Dragon fight was better
[1:16:04] <+mechslayer71> @jaxnos same. DS2 was positively dull in comparison to 3 and the bosses were trash, in a series known for its bosses
[1:16:05] <Lobera64> Wedding door in the Ashina depths
[1:16:08] <%Lion_kun> Mibu village.
[1:16:08] <Klefth> Time for some rad shit
[1:16:10] <pennykettle_> oh shit lets go
[1:16:15] <TheRealGreaterGamer> TIME TO GET MARRIED :D
[1:16:16] <NiSoKr> Oh shit
[1:16:17] <Lobera64> Rope man
[1:16:18] <ullyzeez> bruh play the 2 year flashback for the anime
[1:16:18] <Johannen> I wonder how far Woolie has gone on his own
[1:16:40] <%Mrthefro> Isn't the perfect ending tough to get?
[1:16:41] <+penjaza> Just don't finish the next area
[1:16:43] <primaryfire> you have until the end of the next area before you're locked out of it
[1:16:44] <Lobster_Lord> this room is just princess mononoke
[1:16:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Man we were this close to the end when he quit
[1:16:51] <linSP> make sure to back up your save
[1:16:54] <Reborn2killu> yeah make hime suffer
[1:16:55] <Flare3500> Time to get hitched
[1:17:00] <nutimik> You have a certain point before you can do Owl again
[1:17:03] <JetpackMcQuack> It's confusing when it hasn't been a year
[1:17:05] <+nabs2099> Oh he's already beaten the monkey by this point right
[1:17:05] <munitalprats> this is the weirdest part of the game
[1:17:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Mrthefro kinda
[1:17:06] <enZymeth> Tie the knot
[1:17:06] <pennykettle_> this is the best part of the game because it does weird stuff and its interesting
[1:17:07] <ullyzeez> he was so close to the coolest level too
[1:17:07] <jetjagger222> @Lobster_Lord yeah like the leper rifle people
[1:17:08] <munitalprats> RIGHT HERE
[1:17:09] <munitalprats> HERE IT COMES
[1:17:16] <Lobera64> Rope man
[1:17:20] <disflipmat> okay, I haven't played this since it first came out...what the hell are the remnants?
[1:17:21] <TheRealGreaterGamer> There are 3 variations of the normal ending, and then the shura ending is just choosing to side with Owl
[1:17:23] <Ashenik1> THE FUCK IS THIS?!
[1:17:24] <Professor_Rakor> IT'S YA BOY!
[1:17:24] <%LastHazzerd> there's some obtuse steps, kinda like Bloodborne
[1:17:24] <Aydarkzero> ded
[1:17:25] <+krispen_wa> BEEEG
[1:17:25] <primaryfire> yoink
[1:17:26] <Jontman42> this makes perfect sense
[1:17:28] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp cheese string man
[1:17:29] <Klefth> Oh ya
[1:17:29] <%LastHazzerd> YEAH
[1:17:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> OBVIOUSLY
[1:17:30] <@akuda_bar> YEH. THAT MAKES SENSE
[1:17:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> rip
[1:17:32] <pennykettle_> rope
[1:17:32] <disflipmat> LUCKY DAN
[1:17:33] <NiSoKr> Point of no return is the big boss of this area
[1:17:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE MOST SENSE
[1:17:36] <%X2Eliah> ..... Japan?
[1:17:36] <%sporeian94> Is this a Berserk Reference?
[1:17:37] <linSP> when you can’t think of a good argument so you pull out the strawman
[1:17:38] <+nabs2099> Oh shit, this game could potentially be ended in this stream or by next
[1:17:39] <Sternieliscious> This part reminds me of the voodoo doll guy from Chrono Cross.
[1:17:39] <OblivionSword1> It's magic shut up
[1:17:40] <Jontman42> barrel dick
[1:17:40] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL

[1:17:50] <stormhawk9891> Oh man the next boss is gonna fuck him up with his current playstyle isn't it
[1:17:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Look at his dick!
[1:17:51] <bear_breaker20> the actual point of no return is way futher
[1:17:54] <+krispen_wa> THE NARUTO
[1:17:56] <%LastHazzerd> LOOK AT HIM GO
[1:17:57] <primaryfire> so tired of your strawmen
[1:17:59] <Flare3500> But what about Jesus Woolie the true Hokage
[1:17:59] <disflipmat> @jetjagger222 oh wow, that's definitely new
[1:17:59] <dinnydanny777> I know the half Spider women come from Japanese myths
[1:18:02] <winner_92> jack and the rope stalk
[1:18:04] <+FuqBoiSlim> Ropeman
[1:18:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> What about the incestual Gods woolie?
[1:18:08] <+krispen_wa> THE PERSONA
[1:18:10] <Lobster_Lord> Sekiro is a mix of Japanese and Buddhist
[1:18:12] <%LastHazzerd> Wait for it
[1:18:14] <Lobster_Lord> and some Hindu
[1:18:16] <Coystick> This is just like my Japanese animes
[1:18:19] <vVAstrAVv> dont give up rope man
[1:18:20] <@akuda_bar> HE HIT THE DAB
[1:18:22] <boomsnail72> so what is this like a wickerman of something
[1:18:23] <Professor_Rakor> Dab into death.
[1:18:24] <%LastHazzerd> aaaaaand.... DAB
[1:18:25] <dinnydanny777> I know the trickster cat one
[1:18:25] <pennykettle_> *DAB*

[1:18:30] <Flare3500> And he kinda just stumbles there it';s so weird

[1:18:37] <JayCue_yt> INTENSE DABBARINO
[1:18:37] <+Rekinsinn> LUL
[1:18:37] <winner_92> rope man died for the dab
[1:18:38] <PlumpPotatoRump> it's some kind of ritual role. I think Vadti did a video on the sekiro law. Worth checking out once you've played the game
[1:18:38] <%KineticZen> Smaller versions of those dolls I've seen
[1:18:38] <%jiggy_snipe> @Sternieliscious would not be surprised if this and that reference the same thing
[1:18:42] <jetjagger222> hey its mojo from chrono cross

[1:19:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[1:19:04] <CraZ80> ropeman is streets ahead
[1:19:08] <Flare3500> They could've just teleported Sekiro man , but they chose the weirdest way to bring him here
[1:19:09] <andre11dr> "This dab is for my people"
[1:19:11] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Okay well if there was any boss thats going to force Woolie to learn how to deflect its fucking this one lmao
[1:19:13] <samuelfisk> This is Anor Londo
[1:19:16] <+yukichocomilk> the best area too
[1:19:17] <@Solidus_113> yeah you should
[1:19:17] <brunoberserk> time for  another boss fight
[1:19:18] <Pookiedaexzile> He can dab but is he sturdy?
[1:19:19] <Coystick> Nah don't
[1:19:20] <Reborn2killu> are those bloodstains?
[1:19:22] <Klefth> You should...
[1:19:22] <Coystick> keep ging
[1:19:25] <vVAstrAVv> time for pain
[1:19:28] <Ashenik1> after this boss LUL
[1:19:28] <munitalprats> i mean you'll get emblems just by killing enemies
[1:19:29] <+krispen_wa> Wait is it THAT boss?
[1:19:29] <%sporeian94> WOOLIE IF DON'T 100% STEALTH THIS BOSS YOU ARE A CASUL
[1:19:32] <Lobera64> True monk
[1:19:32] <Jontman42> why not just step on the bridge
[1:19:33] <ullyzeez> keep going!
[1:19:36] <+penjaza> Ashina Castle Dojo, you can assassinate a purple guy, I believe
[1:19:36] <dinnydanny777> Celebi turns into a thing that looks like that in the 4th Pokemon movie
[1:19:37] <%Livelinne> Doll of curse made from huge ass Shimenawa, I assume
[1:19:38] <Lobster_Lord> Maple Syrup time
[1:19:38] <$nodnerbuil> Isn't this a Shimenawa? Coils of rope that symbolize some sort of mysticism?
[1:19:40] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Dont forget to use Mibu blessing item to gain more emblems
[1:19:40] <Professor_Rakor> estate probably
[1:19:41] <+nabs2099> @therealgreatergamer I'm still mad they patched out the double stealth lol
[1:19:44] <Sternieliscious> Fromsoft just HAS to have a cutscene area transition somewhere, don't they?
[1:19:45] <nutimik> Hirata estate actually gives a bit of money
[1:19:47] <%LastHazzerd> the mibu village?
[1:19:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> lol
[1:19:50] <+Solutha> Should of let him walk forward
[1:19:51] <ullyzeez> farm in the next area!
[1:19:53] <NiSoKr> This is an amazing farming area isn’t it?
[1:20:00] <winner_92> does woolie not have any emblems in reserve? he hasnt rested
[1:20:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Second stealth is intended and cool, first is JANK AF lmao
[1:20:16] <@Solidus_113> use your balloons too
[1:20:19] <jetjagger222> the first stealth blow felt like a bug
[1:20:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @winner_92 nope
[1:20:21] <+nabs2099> nah man double stealth for the win
[1:20:29] <ullyzeez> man chat is bonking chat but Minh is a bad backseater too lmao
[1:20:32] <Johannen> @jetjagger222 It was a bug, it was patched
[1:20:34] <bear_breaker20> minh baiting us hard
[1:20:35] <+krispen_wa> Farming stream leggoooo
[1:20:36] <Lobster_Lord> Strive delay hurts a lot. Might have to turn to drugs like Chipp in order to fill the void.
[1:20:37] <winner_92> wow i guess i just never used emblems that much i always had a million in reserve
[1:20:39] <samuelfisk> First stealth was patched out
[1:20:45] <jetjagger222> @Johannen oh shit i played this day 1 lol
[1:20:59] <andre11dr> This return was a bad idea LUL
[1:21:00] <dinnydanny777> limesDab
[1:21:11] <jetjagger222> did they ever explain the things at the bottom of the lake
[1:21:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pump up the jam
[1:21:29] <%Mrthefro> I ran out of emblems on the final boss and I was like "guess I'll die".
[1:21:34] <Flare3500> Hold square to get items
[1:21:35] <@Solidus_113> there's a succ button
[1:21:41] <%X2Eliah> actual zombies?
[1:21:43] <Lobera64> The final boss is so good
[1:21:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> succccc
[1:21:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> s u c c
[1:21:50] <NiSoKr> Hold square to succ
[1:21:57] <winner_92> idk why they didnt just make emblems work like the gourd where there's a set number that refreshes when you rest
[1:21:57] <+nabs2099> I'm honestly surprised anyone could run out of emblems cos I got 999 much faster than I was expecting
[1:22:01] <%Josef_Stryker> Just go on a village massacre I see
[1:22:02] <jetjagger222> @X2Eliah nah wolf just decided to go ham on a bunch of senior citizens
[1:22:04] <Lobster_Lord> Don't need emblems to Ichimonji, the only skill you will ever need
[1:22:09] <Flare3500> The candies are fun to eat because of the poses
[1:22:22] <vVAstrAVv> this is why i max emblems at the start while they're dirt ass cheap lol
[1:22:23] <munitalprats> its not like woolie was using his spirit emblems that much tho
[1:22:26] <@Solidus_113> it's like 3 minutes
[1:22:28] <munitalprats> it was just the blade
[1:22:43] <bear_breaker20> woolie doesnt know about airborne ashina style...
[1:22:46] <$arcielardor> So Infinite Versus is now dead.
[1:23:04] <%Noonoox12> yoooo I love the miniboss here
[1:23:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @arcielardor wait really?
[1:23:07] <$arcielardor> Developer took it off steam.
[1:23:08] <+krispen_wa> Infinite Versus? More like Finite Versus amirite
[1:23:09] <ullyzeez> so V is waaaay better at guiding hips than Minh huh
[1:23:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @bear_breaker20 Woolie doesnt know a lot of things
[1:23:12] <+Sharmanyx> Woolie killed infinite verses Kappa
[1:23:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> RIIIIIP
[1:23:12] <FutaSnek> This is a good place to farm
[1:23:13] <Lobster_Lord> airborne flame barrel is pretty OD. it wrecks Isshin
[1:23:17] <+nabs2099> Hey @solidus_113 Any way to let woolz know that empowered mortal draw and regular doesn't actually need emblems to work. it'll be weaker but it still works. only saying cos it defos helps me out when I play.
[1:23:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This game was so cool
[1:23:23] <nutimik> they don't seem to give any emblems at all
[1:23:30] <convo445> any first boss attempt should be seeing how far you can go without emblem usage and figure out a strategy
[1:23:42] <@Solidus_113> I can't really help with that, he reads chat on his own time
[1:23:43] <%Mrthefro> I actually don't remember how the constant jumping started. It's been a while but isn't there a dash?
[1:23:48] <JetpackMcQuack> After fighting owl this is pretty satisfying
[1:23:48] <%LastHazzerd> Kill ingeniously
[1:23:54] <Johannen> "ьк
[1:24:00] <+nabs2099> @solidus_113 Fair enough. at any rate I don't wanna ruin his fun.
[1:24:01] <Sternieliscious> Thrusts are Mikiri Counter.
[1:24:05] <ullyzeez> not necessarily no
[1:24:06] <CraZ80> yeah
[1:24:20] <Johannen> @Mrthefro Prob cause jump is on the usual dodge button, so Woolie does that automaticly
[1:24:23] <%LastHazzerd> Thrust Danger sign, Grapple Danger Sign, Low Sweep Danger Sign
[1:24:28] <+thunderaznable> ayyy whats good Woolz
[1:24:36] <Lobster_Lord> you can still perfect parry some of the danger sign moves
[1:24:41] <%Mrthefro> @Johannen  ah OK
[1:24:45] <BaslerJones> damn this game is so sick
[1:24:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ayye there you go woolie
[1:24:47] <$tallik44123> woolie playing vietnam simulator
[1:24:53] <+krispen_wa> For a game with literally no builds, there is a ton of farming involved
[1:24:55] <munitalprats> NOO
[1:24:56] <Ashenik1> LUL
[1:24:59] <+matteasy31> D:
[1:25:01] <+thunderaznable> nah u got this
[1:25:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> rip
[1:25:01] <munitalprats> lytNOTIKETHIS
[1:25:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> lol
[1:25:03] <%LastHazzerd> OH NO, but also COOL
[1:25:04] <Professor_Rakor> for speed purposes, you don't really need to finishing blow all of them
[1:25:05] <Timarkot> Remove it
[1:25:07] <andre11dr> Oh i forgot about that
[1:25:08] <+Solutha> there they go
[1:25:08] <%LastHazzerd> unequip
[1:25:09] <nutimik> lol that's why I always take off the ninjutsu
[1:25:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I always just bought them
[1:25:18] <NiSoKr> Rip emblems lol
[1:25:19] <+nabs2099> Hey chat, correct me if I'm wrong, but we get ceremonial tanto after beating all the Shichimen warriors right?
[1:25:21] <TheJaydedFox> TheJaydedFox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:25:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is ok you can buy more with the money you're making
[1:25:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> SveriSageAdvice subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Excited to see you on the stream again Minh, hope you and Woolie have a good day and I'll see ya around later in FFXIV psaDogchamp
[1:25:34] <Flare3500> How much is spirit emblem you can buy them if I remember right
[1:25:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @nabs2099  nah just the one on the way to the depths
[1:25:55] <Johannen> @Flare3500 They get more expensive as the game goes on
[1:25:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> These grabs suck
[1:26:00] <+nabs2099> @abelincoln_catpuncher That's better than I was expecting! that migjt help Woolz out a lot.
[1:26:01] <%Noonoox12> Hey chat, just joined. Are they farming or actually going for progress?
[1:26:01] <munitalprats> the graboids
[1:26:09] <+krispen_wa> farming
[1:26:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:26:11] <+nabs2099> @noonoox12 both
[1:26:15] <+krispen_wa> for progress
[1:26:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yes
[1:26:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Out of curiosity is there a particular reason Minh doesnt read chat FOR woolie so that he might be able to relay correct information lol\
[1:26:20] <%Noonoox12> cool
[1:26:35] <Lobster_Lord> !MOTIVATED
[1:26:35] <@Moobot> 2086 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:26:47] <red_fox_zero> The area directly after the upcoming boss is the best for farming. No contest.
[1:26:50] <+LeaIsChill> Thank goodness you collected everything two years ago
[1:26:52] <+nabs2099> @therealgreatergamer probably cos a lot of people in chat are super rude for no reason
[1:26:54] <nutimik> @TheRealGreaterGamer because chat is probably wrong 50% of the time
[1:26:55] <Johannen> @TheRealGreaterGamer Prob cause Woolie asked him not to, and generaly for the Anime sake
[1:26:57] <+krispen_wa> Because chat would annoy woolie if he read it
[1:26:57] <CraZ80> @WoolieVersus careful these fuckers can swarm  you
[1:26:58] <+matteasy31> BONG
[1:26:59] <Indigo_Automaton> DONG
[1:27:00] <Timarkot> We are at backseating the backseater level
[1:27:03] <%X2Eliah> oh no it's fat evil blanca
[1:27:04] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> BWONG
[1:27:06] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Makes sense
[1:27:11] <+matteasy31> UNGA BUNGA
[1:27:13] <munitalprats> @Johannen you're implying we were rude when a lot of people were just saying "woolie needs to be more aggressive"
[1:27:17] <Kohei_kyouji> i hope he stops jumping someday...
[1:27:17] <Coystick> BONG
[1:27:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BONG
[1:27:19] <+matteasy31> He got the UNGA BUNGA build
[1:27:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Didnt consider the ANIME
[1:27:20] <Solidnick18> dong dong
[1:27:20] <@akuda_bar> can i get one of those for an alarm clock
[1:27:26] <@akuda_bar> it's 12 bong
[1:27:28] <Johannen> @munitalprats Never said anything about rude
[1:27:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL LUL
[1:27:30] <Ashenik1> @TheRealGreaterGamer  becasue nobody wants nuclear bans
[1:27:35] <Flare3500> You just do a looney tunes death when you get bonked with the bell
[1:27:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Fucking Jonny Bell over here
[1:27:43] <Lobster_Lord> backseating a souls game on Twitch? no way, that unprecedented.
[1:27:49] <+Burdenslo> Fuck those giant lads they’re all bastards
[1:27:53] <Coystick> Oh no here comes Britain
[1:27:57] <+LeaIsChill> @munitalprats Telling someone who doesn't want your advice what to do is exactly what rudeness is. Let him play his game
[1:28:11] <munitalprats> Cool, what are we going to talk about @LeaIsChill
[1:28:11] <deviljhojho_> using a bell as a weapon is kind of fucking sick tho
[1:28:11] <Sternieliscious> Bell guy is the worst of the big boys.
[1:28:12] <@akuda_bar> @munitalprats @LeaIsChill please move on
[1:28:13] <+matteasy31> I think I avoided that big boi LUL
[1:28:13] <+Burdenslo> @coystick what you mean mate!? SMOrc
[1:28:17] <Jaxnos> oh boy
[1:28:22] <+penjaza> Remember that Pause is Pause in this game
[1:28:22] <+LeaIsChill> Yeah I need to just start ignoring chat LUL
[1:28:39] <deviljhojho_> looks cool crikGood
[1:28:44] <Flare3500> Does Minh or Woolie knows how to use the hidden tooth ?
[1:28:47] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @leaischill I know right lol I'm on the same vibe
[1:28:53] <+nabs2099> I'm usually an anime watcher but I have more respect for woolie after seeing how toxic chat can get lol
[1:28:58] <@akuda_bar> fight the microphone
[1:28:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Streams over
[1:29:00] <Ashenik1> the flying monks were really fun to fight, like mini-mini-bosses
[1:29:04] <mr_saturday93> Just beat off to woolies gorgeous visage
[1:29:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> We fought one boss
[1:29:13] <+matteasy31> Anyone know what mics they use?
[1:29:14] <mr_saturday93> that's what I do
[1:29:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just Anihilate my ears woolie
[1:29:27] <Johannen> @Flare3500 At some point in 2019 it was exlained, but with how Woolie plays i dont think he can use it well
[1:29:30] <+Sharmanyx> Can’t wait for Conan exiles
[1:29:34] <%Puhff> Good mics
[1:29:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He can do it without emblems, it's not a huge priority
[1:29:50] <@Solidus_113> don't forget skill points
[1:29:56] <Kohei_kyouji> ^
[1:30:02] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah you got a few skill points Woolz
[1:30:03] <munitalprats> you leveled up
[1:30:03] <+GunGrave_od> Sekiro? did Woolie hop on where he left off long ago or did he start over?
[1:30:05] <Lobster_Lord> some people watch streams for the backseating lol. its part of the streaming experience, which is already ridiculous to begin with if you think about it.
[1:30:07] <%X2Eliah> points?
[1:30:17] <+krispen_wa> @starpunchghost left off
[1:30:19] <+Mendin> I think there was a fast farming route near the back of Mibu Village where the ghost ninjas spawn?
[1:30:19] <rainimayonnaise> coin purse
[1:30:21] <+GunGrave_od> ok
[1:30:21] <Flare3500> I only learned how to use the Hidden Tooth thanks Liam's stream of Sekiro

[1:30:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Oh god Minh is recommending spirit emblems over better healing god help us
[1:30:49] <+matteasy31> *Fire Emblem theme song plays*
[1:30:50] <Kohei_kyouji> i wouldnt waste that hard earned exp on emblem upgrades
[1:30:53] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:30:55] <+krispen_wa> FIRE EMBLEMS
[1:30:57] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:31:00] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:31:14] <+matteasy31> Woolie plays Fire Emblem confirmed PogChamp
[1:31:15] <Flare3500> That's a vergil that's what i call the ashina cross
[1:31:16] <Lobster_Lord> Mortal blade strats, lmao LUL
[1:31:17] <Kohei_kyouji> literally anything other than spirit emblem upgrades
[1:31:21] <+krispen_wa> So who is best fire emblem character and why is it Haar?
[1:31:36] <Aydarkzero> @krispen_wa you spelled Nino wrong
[1:31:45] <disflipmat> I miss those cool animations in Lords of Shadow
[1:31:48] <vVAstrAVv> minh spittin truth
[1:31:51] <NiSoKr> Those are excellent
[1:31:53] <Sternieliscious> The sword is the best weapon. Make the sword's passive better.
[1:31:54] <%jonblnt> just like demon souls remake
[1:31:57] <Lobster_Lord> Strive command list did that, it was so good
[1:32:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> isn't the ashina cross the 1-2 slash from the sheath?
[1:32:06] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You literally see enemies use this move on you. A video wouldnt be necessary if you had memory lol
[1:32:22] <+krispen_wa> Is there a Tsubame Gaeshi in this game? can you break dimensions?
[1:32:29] <Flare3500> The only thing good about Nioh
[1:32:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @krispen_wa I respect your taste but I don't agree, PoR is still the best tho imo
[1:32:35] <vVAstrAVv> how you gonna know what moves what dummy
[1:32:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Also woodblock prints are cool
[1:32:45] <nutimik> nooo those are a trap
[1:32:50] <Jaxnos> this is gonna be funny
[1:32:56] <@Solidus_113> get one of the recovery ones
[1:32:57] <nutimik> you get 1 extra emblem, they're not worth the skill points
[1:32:59] <munitalprats> vault is for ninjutsu
[1:33:03] <Ashenik1> @TheRealGreaterGamer you dont remember every single move of enemies and dont know how does it feel when you are doing it ;d
[1:33:15] <Jaxnos> it's too late, the commitment has occurred, let it riiiiiiide baby
[1:33:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:33:26] <+Burdenslo> A video demonstration doesn’t take anything away so why not have it?
[1:33:32] <Flare3500> get the skills that give money
[1:33:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> they are
[1:33:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie you could have gotten BETTER HEALING
[1:33:46] <Lobster_Lord> nothing wrong with a video demo
[1:33:50] <+krispen_wa> Souls games have a lot of obtuse bullshit that should be more clear. its just from being Jank
[1:34:00] <DatAsuna> they're for dumping when you max everything else
[1:34:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's fiiiiine
[1:34:02] <munitalprats> you spent too many
[1:34:02] <%X2Eliah> wow, rude
[1:34:04] <munitalprats> no you didnt
[1:34:07] <T_Sasquatch> video demos have been pretty standard lately
[1:34:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeahhhhh bring cryptic isn't necessary for difficulty
[1:34:12] <munitalprats> there was a healing upgrade
[1:34:13] <convo445> the only remedy of emblem shortages is buying them or the blood emblems
[1:34:19] <red_fox_zero> Yeah, barely worth it.
[1:34:25] <Ashenik1> In the end it all doesnt matter when facing the last boss Kappa
[1:34:29] <Johannen> I assumed Woolie played from the start up to previous LP point, but this is gonna get rough
[1:34:29] <rainimayonnaise> a max of 20 emblems is worth it
[1:34:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ashenik1 truer words have never been spoken
[1:34:50] <moeartifact> i always farmed money and then bought all the emblems, seemed faster
[1:34:51] <+krispen_wa> so this is a Farming stream eh
[1:34:56] <munitalprats> but you'll have a brand new area to get exp in
[1:35:01] <Lobster_Lord> i just want to skip to the part where Woolie gets wrecked by Isshin and quits souls games forever.
[1:35:03] <Kohei_kyouji> you have an odd number of max emblems now. now you must get another upgrade to fix it. you are trapped
[1:35:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> next area Kreygasm
[1:35:10] <@Solidus_113> the exp scaling in Sekiro is fucked, you need so much more every level
[1:35:10] <NiSoKr> I literally never was low on spirit emblems
[1:35:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> If woolie actually beats this game I will consider giving him money in the form of a donation
[1:35:24] <vVAstrAVv> please sir, i want some progress
[1:35:33] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Hidden Forest and go backwards for quick XP
[1:35:42] <andre11dr> I mean, people still can't move their lips in these games but there's multi fazed huge bosses and massive zones
[1:35:43] <Coystick> Nightjar Reversal best skilly
[1:35:46] <+yukichocomilk> yeah it's fine
[1:35:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @solidus_113 grinding to NG+4 for all abilities NotLikeThis
[1:35:55] <Sternieliscious> At the end of the day, the game has to be completable by any build. Don't give up, Skeleton.
[1:35:58] <rainimayonnaise> yeah is all extra
[1:36:01] <vVAstrAVv> you get tons of points by endgame
[1:36:08] <+krispen_wa> There are no builds in Sekiro
[1:36:14] <+RyTYoung> It's all about the Persona 5 way of "Take your time" Kappa
[1:36:16] <Ashenik1> remember you can finish every souls game withou leveling casuals Kappa
[1:36:19] <EvolNom> Woolie love your podcast it gets me through my work day
[1:36:22] <ullyzeez> wtf
[1:36:22] <+nabs2099> @woolieversus You're doing perfectly fine, man. ignore chat. also if you're playing regularly you'll get a shit ton of emblems back too. no worries.
[1:36:35] <convo445> no build just sword good
[1:36:43] <Lobster_Lord> Gunfort gave me so many issues. Harder than the final boss imo
[1:36:47] <oceanmatt> L3
[1:36:48] <+nabs2099> @ashenik1 You're totally right but also I enjoy fun
[1:36:56] <ullyzeez> L3
[1:36:59] <convo445> keep in mind Minh is here to grind
[1:37:20] <EvolNom> Your awesome @woolieversus love the podcast
[1:37:20] <convo445> and the grind is here for Minh
[1:37:22] <DudeDern> The online in this game is kinda dumb
[1:37:26] <@Solidus_113> crouching with the touch pad is cursed
[1:37:29] <+nabs2099> @lobster_lord Heh. just run through and dodge everyone.
[1:37:32] <leto_ii_muadibadder> dinklebeanUx
[1:37:36] <Jaxnos> what a time to be alive
[1:37:37] <Johannen> @nabs2099 If he would play regularly, but that aint happening
[1:37:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Aren't they all women here?
[1:37:43] <NiSoKr> Remember to succ
[1:37:45] <Ashenik1> @nabs2099 I will be having time for fun when I will be in grave Kappa
[1:37:47] <%Seancicle> 5 second delay
[1:37:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just woolie things, using the touch pad for a crucial mechanic lol
[1:37:58] <Flare3500> Must've been the wind
[1:38:13] <@akuda_bar> @Flare3500 did you see something? i thought i saw something.
[1:38:21] <+krispen_wa> TONY LAZUTO?
[1:38:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> TONY LAZUTO?
[1:38:31] <DudeDern> This is some real cheese
[1:38:32] <stormhawk9891> WHAT WAS THAT
[1:38:34] <EvolNom> EXPLOITS! Lol
[1:38:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING
[1:38:46] <@akuda_bar> did you see something?!
[1:38:47] <+nabs2099> @johannen I mean I can see him ending the game in like 2 or 3 streams so it should be fine.
[1:38:57] <@Menitta> [GONG] "yeah that's definitely the sound that wind makes"
[1:38:57] <stormhawk9891> TONY LAZUDO
[1:39:02] <@akuda_bar> anyway the whole business is run by tony lazuto!
[1:39:06] <+krispen_wa> The whole operation is-
[1:39:10] <+nabs2099> @ashenik1 Understandable. have a nice funeral.
[1:39:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> WHAT WAS THAT
[1:39:13] <Flare3500> @akuda_bar My friend died , and that guy I saw walked in this one directional cave , but oh well
[1:39:19] <+krispen_wa> YOU HEAR SOMETHING
[1:39:22] <Lobster_Lord> Owl approved cheese
[1:39:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Cheesy cheese cheese 🧀
[1:39:34] <CoffeeSlice> C H O E S E
[1:39:34] <Flare3500> Owl is clapping right now
[1:39:46] <+MrMediocrity> Holy Sh*t its Minh
[1:39:51] <+nabs2099> Fuck honour. we all about that VICTORY
[1:39:51] <+krispen_wa> Anyone got some macaroni for this choese
[1:39:52] <Pyrrhus90> Owl is proud LUL
[1:39:53] <Pookiedaexzile> It aint easy being Cheesey
[1:39:58] <DudeDern> Imagine being stuck in a time loop where someone keeps stabbing you in the back
[1:40:00] <+Grayhammatter> we got the choese
[1:40:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeahhhh that's def s bad aspect of this game, similar to blood vials in Bloodborne
[1:40:09] <@akuda_bar> it's accupuncture
[1:40:16] <%Jetzord> Dormamu I've come to bargain
[1:40:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:40:24] <Flare3500> Woolie might even get the courage to fight that 2nd guy
[1:40:24] <Johannen> XP loss is absolute momentum killer
[1:40:24] <andre11dr> @dudedern Isn't that just Requiem
[1:40:30] <@akuda_bar> @Jetzord LUL LUL
[1:40:30] <+nabs2099> @dudedern Ah like Prometheus but less hurty
[1:40:33] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[1:40:37] <+Grayhammatter> the botch

[1:43:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Unghosted Monk
[1:43:06] <+Gallhint> damn tony shalhoub be kinda thicc doe monkaS
[1:43:11] <+RyTYoung> This is a badass fight
[1:43:12] <Ashenik1> monk is a fun 2 phases fight Kappa
[1:43:13] <vVAstrAVv> i say again ffffffUCK this boss
[1:43:14] <Lobster_Lord> what a nice arena
[1:43:16] <winner_92> ha ha ha :)
[1:43:18] <+nabs2099> @therealgreatergamer I'll be impressed by Pat when he beats it charmless demon bell NG+7
[1:43:20] <+krispen_wa> Is the Corrupted Monk the bad ending path of Old Monk?
[1:43:21] <Johannen> Monk 2 Now with additives
[1:43:22] <Flare3500> Distortions Speedrun on this game for the first two weeks were insane
[1:43:24] <Slim_Lipid> where's your blindfold, Woolie? it's just a rhythm game
[1:43:37] <TheFramedWarlock> This boss is so easy
[1:43:38] <@Solidus_113> I see Twitch's bitrates still absolutely hates this game
[1:43:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> God woolie needs to unmap the jump button not the crouch lmao
[1:43:46] <Ashenik1> blocking in the air is so cool
[1:43:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh so that's not my connection then
[1:43:55] <triggersqueeze1985> Fat official boss fight
[1:43:58] <jetjagger222> i hate how its ambiguous if the monk is blocking or not
[1:44:06] <+matteasy31> I thought i was my connection LUL
[1:44:06] <%jiggy_snipe> glad to see I'm not the only one
[1:44:10] <CoffeeSlice> OOF
[1:44:12] <+Grayhammatter> she chucklin'
[1:44:12] <+Gallhint> more pixels!
[1:44:14] <munitalprats> if the monk blocks or not hitting is still good @jetjagger222
[1:44:24] <+matteasy31> Bitrate hell baby
[1:44:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @jetjagger222 You rely on the audio cue to determine it
[1:44:25] <munitalprats> if she's blocking she's not hitting you anyway
[1:44:25] <+krispen_wa> Jeezus
[1:44:28] <%Livelinne> shiaUGH
[1:44:30] <munitalprats> rely on audio
[1:44:32] <@Solidus_113> Just gonna have to rewatch the Youtube version for your high quality gameplay
[1:44:38] <andre11dr> Wow ,this is struggling
[1:44:42] <%X2Eliah> Oh that's a big enemy, must be a lot of souls in them
[1:44:43] <+nabs2099> lol this fight is still easy but I miss the double stealthblow
[1:44:50] <vVAstrAVv> EVERY time? every time.
[1:44:51] <+mechslayer71> Still jumping huh?
[1:44:53] <+matteasy31> Jump punished
[1:44:54] <jetjagger222> @TheRealGreaterGamer TIL, thanks, never thought of that
[1:44:57] <TheFramedWarlock> 404 : Deflects not found
[1:45:01] <ullyzeez> first try lets go
[1:45:02] <Johannen> Anti-Air on point
[1:45:04] <Lobster_Lord> the next zone will blow woolie away
[1:45:12] <+matteasy31> Yes, next zone Kreygasm
[1:45:18] <+nabs2099> to clarify, easy for me who's played this game many times. makes sense for woolz to struggle a bit, tho I think he's doing p well rn
[1:45:18] <Ashenik1> man Sekiro but in european setting, fighting crusaders and preists
[1:45:20] <SenpaiMD> one day I will witness woolie block and it will be glorious
[1:45:27] <Crimpson> I assume that Woolie doesn't know deflects play a big role in this game?
[1:45:28] <andre11dr> Don't get Daigo'd again Woolie LUL
[1:45:32] <winner_92> this fight isn't too bad once you know how it works but it's no pushover
[1:45:38] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro in Europe would just be ROBEEEEERT for a whole game
[1:45:44] <NiSoKr> He does he just doesn’t care
[1:45:55] <TheFramedWarlock> Sekiro in Europe is just Dark Souls
[1:45:55] <Johannen> Sekiro-Trickster the Game said Woolie
[1:45:56] <triggersqueeze1985> This is a lot like dark souls
[1:45:58] <jetjagger222> its super hard to win here unless you memorize her animations
[1:46:00] <brunoberserk> sekiroooooooooo
[1:46:02] <munitalprats> mashing deflect actually makes the next reflect have less frames
[1:46:03] <+nabs2099> @ashenik1 Yeah man who wouldn't wanna beat up crusaders and priests
[1:46:05] <jaygee303> Fuck this fight
[1:46:05] <munitalprats> iirc
[1:46:08] <Zayasu> was woolie here when he played on his own?
[1:46:11] <TheFramedWarlock> Wouldn't Sekiro be Royal Guard the game
[1:46:17] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa if it would be set in lat medieval period/ early modern but high middle age?
[1:46:21] <+Mendin> Sekirevengeance
[1:46:22] <rosemon5001> @krispen_wa ROBEEERT i found king JAAAAAMEEEESSS
[1:46:26] <andre11dr> I mean Elden Ring seems to be Sekiro in Europe
[1:46:27] <Johannen> @TheFramedWarlock That's da Joke
[1:46:27] <Lobster_Lord> @Ashenik1 rather go somewhere else. From has done Euro fantasy many times. I want to see Arabian/Aztec bloodborne or something.
[1:46:29] <@Solidus_113> 3 health bars BTW
[1:46:32] <winner_92> @munitalprats that would make a lot of sense because otherwise spamming deflect is real good
[1:46:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Good first run
[1:46:38] <+KillMyPast> Underneath? Just parry
[1:46:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 2 Actually Kappa
[1:46:41] <Flare3500> download complete
[1:46:46] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> duuuuuude Aztec Bloodborne sounds wicked
[1:46:49] <%SainEdge> i always have so much more problems with the ghost form of this boss, it's almost funny, if it wasn't so sad LUL
[1:46:49] <ullyzeez> @theframedwarlock yeah which is why Pat is surprises he fell off
[1:46:52] <soul_overdrive> Ganbatte Woolie-kun !
[1:46:57] <+nabs2099> @lobster_lord No stop hyping me up with Arabian nights Sekiro!
[1:47:06] <+KillMyPast> COWARD
[1:47:09] <+matteasy31> THE CHEESE
[1:47:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus The first deathblow was a glitch they patched out
[1:47:15] <andre11dr> I want SiFi Souls
[1:47:17] <CalusRaccoon> wait when did woolies start streaming sekiro, darn I missed most of it
[1:47:23] <CalusRaccoon> *woolie
[1:47:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[1:47:24] <Peyote_> You can only do the second deathblow like that right?
[1:47:24] <winner_92> you can still get one deathblow from the tree during this fight
[1:47:26] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus They patched out stealth kill on the first phase
[1:47:30] <DudeDern> Learn, fight, and learn some more
[1:47:30] <winner_92> @Peyote_ yep
[1:47:32] <NeoMiami> I remember back when this game first came out you could cheese 2 health bars off of it before it was passed off
[1:47:32] <+Lazy_2> I want NA souls
[1:47:33] <munitalprats> its not in the first phase.
[1:47:38] <ullyzeez> @calusraccoon yoy didnt miss much man
[1:47:42] <NeoMiami> oh nvm he just said it
[1:47:44] <samuelfisk> Aztec Bloodborne is
[1:47:44] <NumbF4ke> @Sainedge you can cheese the ghost form with snapseed
[1:47:52] <+Mendin> The first one was easy, the second one was annoying to pull off
[1:47:53] <+nabs2099> @therealgreatergamer lol it wasn't a glitch they just realised it made the fight too easy
[1:47:53] <+KillMyPast> Just parry
[1:47:55] <+Grayhammatter> those perfect parries, such a nice noise
[1:47:57] <ullyzeez> parry my man
[1:47:58] <+krispen_wa> Bloodborne in Australia. it would just be australia with Amygdala instead of jumping spiders
[1:47:59] <andre11dr> I want GunSouls
[1:48:00] <CalusRaccoon> @ullyzeez okay thanks man
[1:48:06] <Ashenik1> @Lobster_Lord  I fully agree, Ottoman Empire, Monglian Empire, Persian empire are all fucking awesome but man fighting crusaders and preists like here with monk. And Pope as a last fake boss !!
[1:48:06] <winner_92> sekiro's audio design is fucking amazing
[1:48:10] <rosemon5001> @Grayhammatter nodders
[1:48:14] <dinnydanny777> @andre11dr Armored Core Souls limesD
[1:48:16] <Lobster_Lord> Has From ever done a proper desert environment?
[1:48:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @nabs2099 It was definitely a glitch
[1:48:18] <+matteasy31> SourPls
[1:48:27] <%Tenchi_G> Just block bruh! shofuHandsleft shofuHandsright
[1:48:32] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:48:33] <jaid251> Can you stealth kill the second phase?
[1:48:36] <+nabs2099> nah dude. it was intended.
[1:48:38] <Jaxnos> comin in with the otg
[1:48:40] <triggersqueeze1985> 10000 bc souls
[1:48:42] <winner_92> @jaid251 yeah
[1:48:43] <%ekodrop> what is this bitrate hell
[1:48:43] <+KillMyPast> Imagine trying to dodge in Sekiro
[1:48:46] <T_Sasquatch> just roll man Kappa
[1:48:47] <wibbwobbler> sekirooo
[1:48:49] <+krispen_wa> Gilgamesh Souls
[1:48:50] <munitalprats> are we watching the same video? he's blocking at times
[1:48:53] <andre11dr> Actually fuck Souls, where's Metal Wolf Chaos?
[1:48:56] <ullyzeez> @killmypast LUL
[1:49:00] <Lobster_Lord> @Ashenik1 Crusaders could still work in an Arabian setting
[1:49:00] <+Grayhammatter> every time?
[1:49:03] <Professor_Rakor> "Every time"
[1:49:06] <ronin19xx> Everytime? Everytime
[1:49:07] <%sporeian94> NO ONE TELL WOLLIE YOU CAN STEALTH THIS BOSS 100%
[1:49:07] <+krispen_wa> The Bull of Heaven as the final boss with Summonable phantom Enkidu
[1:49:09] <dinnydanny777> That swing is a Jebaited limesLUL
[1:49:09] <munitalprats> he's learning the fight.
[1:49:11] <%Tenchi_G> tsbGiru tsbHorns
[1:49:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Considering the monk is also susceptible to a stealth kill in Mibu via the same glitch, no way was it intentional
[1:49:18] <%Seancicle> TwitchSings 💀
[1:49:20] <%SainEdge> @NumbF4ke oh yeah i now. I just like fighting bosses the "normal" way. I just fuck up a lot of deflects and dodges when fighting the ghost form, whil i'm doing really good against this form. It's weird
[1:49:23] <Johannen> @sporeian94 Have you only played Day1 Sekiro?
[1:49:25] <CoffeeSlice> how tf
[1:49:26] <ronin19xx> Everytime should be a shirt
[1:49:32] <T_Sasquatch> honestly im not excited for elden ring , more dark souls after 3 just feels redundant when sekiro and bloodborne showed how insane fromsoft is
[1:49:39] <Ashenik1> @Lobster_Lord  Teutonic Crusaders are cooler though IMO
[1:49:43] <%sporeian94> @Johannen Oh did they patch it out, the answer is yes I haven't played it sicne release
[1:49:45] <+0BM0Z> nice
[1:49:45] <jetjagger222> does the physical monk have less stamina or something
[1:49:48] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[1:49:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[1:49:52] <%Jetzord> Nice one
[1:49:53] <%LastHazzerd> Here we GO

[1:50:21] <wruce__billis> Just got here how many times has he attempted this fight
[1:50:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> second try
[1:50:29] <%Deekman> you use the sugar that makes you invisible
[1:50:29] <winner_92> you can get the deathblow on the second phase if you get into the right position in time
[1:50:30] <%sporeian94> What else did they patch out?
[1:50:30] <triggersqueeze1985> Bloodborne is my personal favorite from game
[1:50:30] <+0BM0Z> woolies getting way better at parrying straight up
[1:50:31] <+krispen_wa> this is his second
[1:50:34] <+terry_quest> no this is the phase where you death blow
[1:50:34] <Peyote_> you can get a deathblow on the beginning of the second phase ye
[1:50:35] <Lobster_Lord> @T_Sasquatch exactly how I feel. Bloodborne and Sekiro were great departures. I want From to explore other settings.
[1:50:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> "Difficult"
[1:50:50] <Sternieliscious> I've done a phase 2 deathblow as of January.
[1:50:59] <andre11dr> Woolie be getting aniair'd on like it's a Daigo match
[1:51:01] <Johannen> Phase 2 deathblow is intended
[1:51:01] <T_Sasquatch> @Lobster_Lord also tbh i kinda hate ds3 , fromsoft clearly prefers fast paced games

[1:51:52] <El_Rabbit> GO IN! DO COMBO!
[1:51:57] <+nabs2099> and by normally I mean POCKET SAND SLICE SLICE POCKET SAND SLICE SLICE
[1:52:00] <munitalprats> you cant first phase stealth it
[1:52:03] <+terry_quest> its 2nd phase not first
[1:52:03] <munitalprats> that was patched
[1:52:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> There is no first phase stealth
[1:52:09] <+KillMyPast> First phase stealth was patched
[1:52:10] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus It was patched out
[1:52:15] <+krispen_wa> How about India Souls? Shiva the destroyer as the final boss
[1:52:16] <ullyzeez> @nabs2099 you can cheese phase 3 the most reliably
[1:52:20] <the_extra_> 2nd phase
[1:52:21] <T_Sasquatch> @Lobster_Lord wat you didnt love a dark souls game with enemies that attack like bloodborne but you move like a tank Kappa
[1:52:22] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you can only do it 2nd phases Minh
[1:52:23] <Ashenik1> @Lobster_Lord  DS3 feels blant but it has its moments; especieally the DLCs.
[1:52:24] <%Lion_kun> Can't stealth first phase. Only second.
[1:52:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 2nd phase only
[1:52:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Cheese branch, love it
[1:52:31] <jetjagger222> iirc stamina candy works well here
[1:52:37] <%LastHazzerd> the second phase skip is intentional, and should still be there
[1:52:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Maybe if we say it 20 more times they might read chat for the answer
[1:52:41] <$QueequegTheater> Oh my god, Minh is alive nagHandsup
[1:52:45] <%sporeian94> Does wollie know about the sweep
[1:52:56] <andre11dr> Yo ,Hindu Souls would be SICK AS FUCK
[1:52:59] <Sternieliscious> I had an overall better time standing still and doing parries. Movement, I feel, was more sensory info to distract from success.
[1:53:00] <T_Sasquatch> looool
[1:53:02] <+nabs2099> @ullyzeez Yeah I p much just kill it super easily in first phase, stealth 2nd and then pocket sand on third. ezpz
[1:53:06] <+krispen_wa> I love how DS3's entire message is about how it doesnt want to exist
[1:53:08] <Lobster_Lord> DS3 DLC with the world collapsing in on itself, and running on fumes felt like a metaphor for the series itself.
[1:53:11] <dinnydanny777> This is the run limesOk
[1:53:13] <$QueequegTheater> Oh man, this is a rough fight to be getting back in with
[1:53:15] <Ashenik1> You just keep keeping on Woolie and it will click :)
[1:53:16] <absolute_cagemony> Why this game's soundtrack sound like a horror movie soundtrack
[1:53:18] <jetjagger222> hindu/buddhist myth needs more love, like in asuras wrath
[1:53:26] <triggersqueeze1985> Omg
[1:53:26] <Johannen> @sporeian94 He knows but cant do anything unless he plans ahead
[1:53:32] <triggersqueeze1985> Fuck
[1:53:33] <Peyote_> There is a good jacob geller video about DS3 that he released recently which I recommend
[1:53:34] <El_Rabbit> Do Combo!
[1:53:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Lobster_Lord "It's an oversimplication of events, but yes."
[1:53:43] <andre11dr> Hindu doesn't get enough play in video games compared to the other religions
[1:53:48] <+nabs2099> @lobster_lord Honestly we didn't even need DS3. I hope ER is something new more akin to BB and Sekiro rather than dark souls 4.
[1:53:48] <triggersqueeze1985> That damage!
[1:53:51] <jetjagger222> @absolute_cagemony yeah i felt bloodborne and sekiro's OSTs were pretty noisy
[1:53:51] <+golden_sagex> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[1:54:02] <DudeDern> Yeah more hindu games would br SICK
[1:54:03] <+krispen_wa> Hindu mythology is so rad it needs massive budget to do properly
[1:54:09] <CalusRaccoon> @absolute_cagemony It has a LOT of horror elements to the story and tone. Moreso even than souls so it leans into that more. Just a step away from bloodborne
[1:54:13] <GothicCrusader> It is circle WITHOUT direction for mikiri
[1:54:21] <$QueequegTheater> That ground drag attack can be guarded but you have to time it perfectly
[1:54:26] <NiSoKr> She’s got a weird block animation and sound so it seems like you hit her more than you do
[1:54:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:54:32] <Peyote_> hmm I find it easier to press circle+forward for mikiri
[1:54:33] <Jonami90> One tech question: is there a reason why Woolie is streaming at a relatively low bit rate? Upload limit?
[1:54:36] <munitalprats> YES TOVARICH
[1:54:37] <munitalprats> LIKE THAT
[1:54:37] <BaslerJones> is that benkei
[1:54:41] <@Solidus_113> you can just check the move controls in the skill list
[1:54:42] <Kohei_kyouji> @Peyote_ same
[1:54:44] <CommanderCOOL> Raji an Anicent Epic is a great new hindu game inspired by prince of persia
[1:54:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sekiro is my favourite rhythm game
[1:54:45] <Coystick> She 'avin a giggle
[1:54:50] <jetjagger222> sekiro combat actually reminds me a lot of OG prince of persia
[1:54:51] <H3alingRos3> wow this guy is horrifying
[1:54:53] <Flare3500> Nah it's just Twitch shitting itself
[1:54:58] <KingVantq> Anyone in chat know why Woolie originally dropped Sekiro?

[2:01:55] <Ashenik1> convert this pagan Woolie !!
[2:01:58] <andre11dr> This SMT boss must be weak to something, maybe try Mazio
[2:02:04] <pixel_river> @ullyzeez  They knew people would throw controllers and give up otherwise
[2:02:07] <$QueequegTheater> She'll hold the weapon out horizontally for the sweep but pull it close to her for the lunge
[2:02:11] <munitalprats> EXACTLY that
[2:02:12] <Flare3500> Download complete
[2:02:16] <Lobster_Lord> her weakness is the former Tokyo Olympics head telling her she talks too much.
[2:02:17] <Kohei_kyouji> @andre11dr probs hama
[2:02:25] <+Bailey__gaming> i remember struggling a little at her but not as much against you know who later
[2:02:26] <+b_aleph> hey, it's Mihn!
[2:02:26] <ullyzeez> overhead wtf hahaha dont crouch LUL
[2:02:29] <+nabs2099> @andre11dr haha
[2:02:31] <%LastHazzerd> Monks only want one thing, and it's disgusting 🐛
[2:02:38] <+b_aleph> long time no see
[2:02:43] <Ashenik1> @Bailey__gaming yeah the Dragon is a fucking wall
[2:02:45] <Flare3500> Use your Super Sword thingy that I forgot the name
[2:02:48] <jetjagger222> iirc nightjar slice is really good here to punish
[2:03:06] <+nabs2099> @flare3500 mortal blade not so good for this one
[2:03:08] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus She will hold the spear out horizontally behind her before she sweeps
[2:03:09] <Kohei_kyouji> @Flare3500 divine confetti?
[2:03:11] <%LastHazzerd> there's like 2-3 i-frames on the dodge
[2:03:12] <Lobster_Lord> a lot of her moves can whiff in weird places
[2:03:19] <munitalprats> learn the fight before you need to use consumables.
[2:03:23] <LoudmicRPG> @WoolieVersus Is this you returning to Sekiro? Or some specific new run or just fucking around or whats going on? You are pretty late into the game afterall, how come?
[2:03:30] <$QueequegTheater> @LoudmicRPG returning
[2:03:32] <pixel_river> 死
[2:03:33] <@akuda_bar> d-e-t-h... dessss
[2:03:38] <+Bailey__gaming> i wonder if woolie will figure out the tooth tech that lets u have 3 lives by eating the deathtooth at the right time
[2:03:47] <+nabs2099> @loudmicrpg he's back because he was playing off screen and started having fun again
[2:03:57] <+TheotherKristian> Woolie...will eventually figure it out
[2:03:59] <+Burdenslo> What the hell is tooth tech?
[2:04:04] <+krispen_wa> Try using the Dragon Bone Smasher with cracked Talisman of Beasts
[2:04:08] <$QueequegTheater> True Monk is for real
[2:04:11] <jetjagger222> timmy the tooth
[2:04:12] <CoffeeSlice> lol
[2:04:17] <%Lion_kun> When she points at you, you know the baseball swing is coming.
[2:04:18] <munitalprats> there's a tooth that kills yourself but doesnt stop you from ressurecting after the first one @Burdenslo
[2:04:18] <+nabs2099> woolz you're doing really well!
[2:04:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> This is one of the easiest fights in the game Kappa Kappa
[2:04:20] <Kohei_kyouji> @Burdenslo killing yourself manually via the tooth so you dont lose a ressurection
[2:04:22] <Lobster_Lord> The tooth tech is Skelly giving you another death defiance
[2:04:28] <kamenspidey> tooth tech is when you play with your teeth
[2:04:29] <+Jakeofalco> did he start from when he left off ?
[2:04:31] <Solidnick18> the final boss gave me alot of trouble
[2:04:33] <%BinaryFireball> people say it's easy but I think thats bs
[2:04:34] <+nabs2099> @krispen_wa cracked talisman?
[2:04:38] <Flare3500> Tooth is killing yourself to get a free revive
[2:04:38] <%BinaryFireball> this fight is hard
[2:04:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> True monk is easy Top 3
[2:04:39] <munitalprats> I think its BS that people say its easy too
[2:04:40] <+Bailey__gaming> @Burdenslo basicly theres a tooth item that kills u but using it doesnt lock u out of the other 2 res
[2:04:43] <munitalprats> i died a couple times in here aswell.
[2:04:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I personally found it easy and beat it first try
[2:04:53] <pixel_river> genichiro in the tower took me days
[2:04:54] <jetjagger222> skelly's lucky tooth
[2:04:57] <+Burdenslo> @bailey__gaming holy shit that’s awesome
[2:05:00] <Ashenik1> the final boss was the hardest and the best shit that this game has to offer IMHO
[2:05:01] <NiSoKr> This fight is easy in comparison to latter bosses
[2:05:06] <Timarkot> Easier than illusion monk
[2:05:11] <munitalprats> EXACTLY THAT
[2:05:12] <munitalprats> TWO SWINGS
[2:05:14] <jetjagger222> that fucker in the well though
[2:05:14] <%BinaryFireball> Sekiro is a game about your personal style. I found the hard bosses easy and the easy bosses super hard
[2:05:25] <%Lion_kun> Hardest bosses are owl father, demon of hatred, sword Saint and Shura Isshin
[2:05:37] <+Bailey__gaming> i cant say who i think is hardest in game without spoilers so i wont but they like bananas
[2:05:37] <ullyzeez> POG
[2:05:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I SOMEHOW beat Owl and Genichiro first try as well and those will be the highlights of my life
[2:05:44] <+Burdenslo> The giant monke i found to be insanely hard
[2:05:45] <andre11dr> This fight fucked me up for a while, but then i found the faze 2 istant kill
[2:05:47] <+krispen_wa> @nabs2099 a cracked talisman is using the talisman of beasts without the required stats. if you do that, cursed weapon only drains 1hp per second while still giving you 50% damage
[2:05:48] <Lobster_Lord> Ape gave me trouble
[2:05:56] <jetjagger222> yeah monke is fucking tough
[2:06:01] <Kohei_kyouji> @BinaryFireball i found most of it easy apart from that ashina cross spammer <_<  my arthritis makes it hard to double tap
[2:06:04] <Ashenik1> @Lion_kun  I think Machinegun Saint is worst than Sword one Kappa
[2:06:08] <chronoxgp> i spent like several hours on the last guy
[2:06:08] <NiSoKr> I don’t find DoH hard personally. My least favorite is twin monkeys
[2:06:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm gonna say corrupted monk is harder than owl father
[2:06:13] <$QueequegTheater> The hardest boss in the game is also the worst one since it's not a sekiro boss it's a Bloodborne boss
[2:06:14] <pixel_river> monkey was a pain in the neck
[2:06:15] <andre11dr> Gun Saint took me like 5 hours
[2:06:15] <ullyzeez> just inject mikiri counters into my veins
[2:06:23] <+nabs2099> @krispen_wa Oooh that's p sick! too bad I'll lose that eventually cos I wanna use faith stuff too.
[2:06:27] <thebalticguy1> Is Woolie not using the Phase 2 Stealth start?
[2:06:37] <munitalprats> Its still safer
[2:06:39] <Lobster_Lord> I used the umbrella cheese on DoH
[2:06:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @thebalticguy1 No he's too bad
[2:06:45] <Ashenik1> watch woolie doing Saint in 5 tries Kappa
[2:06:46] <GrandBlitzAce> he tried and failed to do it
[2:06:47] <ullyzeez> its why theyre there man
[2:06:47] <+Fenris_Alexius> DoH sucks. At least final boss is hard but is also fucking rad
[2:06:49] <Johannen> @thebalticguy1 He cant execute it
[2:06:55] <thebalticguy1> HOW
[2:06:56] <GrandBlitzAce> the gave up
[2:06:59] <+nabs2099> @lobster_lord That's a strat not a cheese lol
[2:07:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> We know lol
[2:07:03] <Indigo_Automaton> God Mikiri Counter's are the raddest shit
[2:07:05] <shadowboss89> The hardest boss imo is Juzou the drunkard with all his f-n goons
[2:07:11] <jetjagger222> yeah fuck that uppercut
[2:07:13] <Kohei_kyouji> @Fenris_Alexius DoH is oddly my favourite boss >_>
[2:07:15] <Peyote_> ashina seven spears lol
[2:07:16] <munitalprats> SO CLOSE
[2:07:20] <$Chumblago13> Bosses that got trivialized by perfect parrying felt great to fight like this one.
[2:07:23] <Lobster_Lord> @nabs2099 i know, but it felt like a cheese after dying so many times to him normally.
[2:07:24] <$QueequegTheater> @shadowboss89 don't fight him until you clear the goons
[2:07:28] <+krispen_wa> anyone here doing Return to Drangleic, i tried but not that many people seem to be doing it
[2:07:30] <jetjagger222> mist noble is toughest boss in the entire from catalogue
[2:07:30] <%Lion_kun> Notice how they balance the boss by giving her less posture than the ghost form.
[2:07:32] <$Chumblago13> Didn’t enjoy Demon of Hatred though.
[2:07:49] <pixel_river> nice
[2:07:54] <Sternieliscious> Chained Ogre is up there for deaths on my run.
[2:07:57] <munitalprats> dont forget your thrust too!
[2:07:58] <Flare3500> Demon of Hatred was fun for me because of the fire umbrella
[2:08:00] <jetjagger222> ow
[2:08:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jetjagger222 shh spoilers dude
[2:08:05] <Peyote_> yeah I was expecting more people for return to drangleic
[2:08:06] <ullyzeez> seven spears are a fuck
[2:08:09] <Johannen> Chained Ogre on Day1 Sekiro was straight up BS
[2:08:12] <munitalprats> RESSURECT IS BACK
[2:08:12] <%Lion_kun> DoH is a bloodborne boss in the wrong game.
[2:08:12] <brunoberserk> HE'S STARTING TO BELIEVE
[2:08:14] <+Fenris_Alexius> I really hope there's aspects of Sekiro in Elden Ring. I want build versatility but don't want to lose the amazing flow of Sekiro fights and the weight and visceral nature of the custom deathblow animations
[2:08:15] <Coystick> Cleeeean
[2:08:16] <$Chumblago13> Royal Guard squad where you at?
[2:08:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @munitalprats

[2:08:23] <shadowboss89> @queequegtheater hey may be drunk but super aware, plus it legit feels like he hits harder than all the other bosses

[2:14:05] <ullyzeez> cool :)
[2:14:05] <oneimportantthing> Ya got got
[2:14:05] <Sternieliscious> Terror is the Curse variant from Souls. Instant kill.
[2:14:06] <+matteasy31> You can do this
[2:14:07] <Lobster_Lord> pocket sand
[2:14:09] <NiSoKr> I believed
[2:14:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Woolie you have rice as well
[2:14:09] <munitalprats> remember you're missing a ressurect now
[2:14:18] <NumbF4ke> You can do it
[2:14:25] <$QueequegTheater> He had two full heals feelbadman
[2:14:26] <TimeWanderer> That health bar was basically empty. This is doable.
[2:14:30] <Ashenik1> THESE POCKETS
[2:14:31] <oneimportantthing> Woolie will figure it out...?
[2:14:32] <Kohei_kyouji> fistful of ash is what you were after before @WoolieVersus
[2:14:34] <munitalprats> Its the Ash that people are bugging you about
[2:14:45] <$Chumblago13> I completely forgot about rice. I never used it
[2:14:48] <Flare3500> They're buffs and cool pose
[2:14:49] <jetjagger222> pockets' sand
[2:14:52] <Kohei_kyouji> rice is rare
[2:14:53] <+yukichocomilk> why do you guys want him to cheese it? LUL
[2:14:55] <%Theycallmenerf> *throw pocket sand*
[2:14:59] <Lobster_Lord> We did it guys
[2:15:05] <$Chumblago13> this is the run
[2:15:06] <$QueequegTheater> @yukichocomilk because that's the fastest way to win
[2:15:15] <@Solidus_113> can't you pick up new rice whenever from the shrine girl?
[2:15:23] <+yukichocomilk> i guess it's all about your impatience then
[2:15:23] <Johannen> @yukichocomilk Cause cheesing it is the Shinobi Way, Honor is for the foolish Samurai
[2:15:27] <squidmax1> That "mmmmmmMMMMMM!" is burned into my mind.
[2:15:27] <+LeaIsChill> Yeah she spits in it @Solidus_113
[2:15:27] <munitalprats> @Solidus_113 i think you need to not have rice on you
[2:15:33] <+nabs2099> @yukichocomilk A shinobi would know the difference between honour and victory
[2:15:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[2:15:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Solidus_113 yes
[2:15:34] <munitalprats> could be wrong though
[2:15:42] <+krispen_wa> Ichiban would have cleared this fight years ago
[2:15:48] <Kohei_kyouji> @yukichocomilk id rather him win legit...but i dont think he'll improve due to his playstyle. its sort of...'incompatible' with the game?
[2:16:05] <+yukichocomilk> @Kohei_kyouji he can totally beat it legit in a couple tries, he's doing fine
[2:16:12] <munitalprats> 2 is the most ided do
[2:16:13] <Kohei_kyouji> i hope so
[2:16:16] <Johannen> @Kohei_kyouji Yeah too many bad habots
[2:16:16] <$Chumblago13> I believe in Woolie. Just treat it like a fighting game
[2:16:17] <ullyzeez> i wish i can delete this game from my brain and play it again fresh
[2:16:17] <munitalprats> on like, every boss except lady butterfly
[2:16:30] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Although after a certain point she becomes ill because it's made from her blood and you have to give her a persimmon
[2:16:32] <ullyzeez> nothing compares to learning and beating the bosses
[2:16:37] <$QueequegTheater> Maybe if he keeps jumping it will eventually gain iframes KappaHD
[2:16:38] <+nabs2099> using items and exploiting the weaknesses of enemies in games is apparently not fighting them legit I guess .
[2:16:43] <ullyzeez> especially the last one
[2:17:03] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> The power of strafe is strong in this game, though well placed dodge attacks are goat too.
[2:17:08] <+krispen_wa> Nioh is what taught me that using everything I have is not cheating at all
[2:17:13] <+FuqBoiSlim> just don't get hit and hit them 4Head
[2:17:14] <Kohei_kyouji> @ullyzeez the thing is i dont think woolie really 'learns'. i think he just does the same thing til he gets lucky
[2:17:19] <Lobster_Lord> Keep the rhythm up, now jump diagonal
[2:17:19] <$Chumblago13> I think the anti items group just doesnt want Woolie to be early Demon's Souls Reggie thats all.
[2:17:21] <munitalprats> Using items is entirely legit
[2:17:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @krispen_wa but what if you need it later
[2:17:26] <munitalprats> anti items is a stupid idea
[2:17:26] <Ashenik1> @ullyzeez  and then on the next playthrough/NG+ beating them first try :3
[2:17:46] <ulcaban> Does woolie have any pacifying agent?
[2:17:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 1 down
[2:18:01] <Lobster_Lord> Woolie getting the hang of it
[2:18:07] <munitalprats> I **THINK** you can snapseed this
[2:18:17] <munitalprats> but its not a "weakness" like the mibu village fight.,
[2:18:17] <jetjagger222> just run
[2:18:23] <+nabs2099> @munitalprats Exactly this. why lock ourselves away from real mechanics for some weird ass reason like it's not "legit". yes it is. if it wasn't legit it would be a glitch not a feature.
[2:18:29] <Flare3500> Fight the Shadow Jutsus
[2:18:30] <Lobster_Lord> i just run across the bridge during this form
[2:18:33] <Kohei_kyouji> running bad ._.
[2:18:38] <+yukichocomilk> wet nurse phase
[2:18:45] <thebalticguy1> Why would you try and fight this phase when you can just stealth skip?
[2:18:46] <Indigo_Automaton> Snapseed kills the shadows
[2:18:50] <munitalprats> @nabs2099 soul level 1 fights use items all the time
[2:18:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I just kill her instantly and go to phase 3 Kappa
[2:18:54] <T_Sasquatch> i swear you can just spam the grapple weird
[2:18:54] <oneimportantthing> Woooww
[2:18:55] <%Tenchi_G> Shadow clone technique woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:18:56] <+Gallhint> YES
[2:18:56] <Kohei_kyouji> good mikiri reflexes
[2:19:01] <TimeWanderer> This is a strong phase so far.
[2:19:04] <%ChoculaUltra> he has the mikiri DOWNLOADED
[2:19:06] <$Chumblago13> he's got this
[2:19:06] <munitalprats> HE'S BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
[2:19:09] <Johannen> YEYEYE PogChamp
[2:19:13] <+nabs2099> @munitalprats Using items is good. That's why they're there.
[2:19:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CAMERA
[2:19:16] <bear_breaker20> JUST DO IT
[2:19:16] <VJdarkworld> ANY BELIEVERS? KomodoHype

[2:19:29] <Slim_Lipid> @Indigo_Automaton jokes on you, chad already told me it was the wrong boss for snapseed :)
[2:19:37] <VJdarkworld> sniped 0_0
[2:19:38] <Johannen> Jump Punished
[2:19:40] <ullyzeez> ded
[2:19:43] <REGNIERx> This is why I love the shield in this game
[2:19:44] <munitalprats> technically, you can snap seed the shadows but i wouldnt change what woolies doing anyway
[2:19:47] <T_Sasquatch> running on the ground cant be worth it LUL
[2:19:48] <+Dayube> this is not the way
[2:19:50] <NiSoKr> I didn’t know shadows could happen twice in one phase
[2:19:55] <absolute_cagemony> Isnt this the fight where you can grapple onto the branches and repeatedly do diving attacks or something like that?
[2:19:55] <%Seancicle> FBBlock FBSpiral
[2:19:56] <CoffeeSlice> woah
[2:19:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> why does woolie never do the kick after the jump
[2:19:59] <$QueequegTheater> Wait, how did that work
[2:20:01] <thebalticguy1> I dont think woolie is aggressive enough?
[2:20:02] <Ashenik1> the final boss of Sekiro: Cameraman
[2:20:07] <+Grayhammatter> whoa... interesting dodge, but we take those
[2:20:07] <Johannen> @NiSoKr If you play passive everything repeats
[2:20:07] <Lobster_Lord> snapseed breaks genjutsu
[2:20:17] <+krispen_wa> @nisokr Sekiri: Shadows Happen Twice

[2:21:58] <Storm_Samurai> Nice
[2:22:00] <ullyzeez> what a true ninja
[2:22:09] <munitalprats> BEST AREA IN THE GAMEEE
[2:22:11] <+krispen_wa> First the Bloodstained Beast and now the True Monk. Centipedes all over the shop
[2:22:15] <NiSoKr> psaDab
[2:22:16] <Flare3500> sTONKS
[2:22:23] <Aesopska> thats new
[2:22:24] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> The "False" monk was just a genjutsu cast by the real one.
[2:22:25] <+Burdenslo> psaDab
[2:22:25] <brunoberserk> ok whats the deal with the corrupted monk ?
[2:22:37] <Solidnick18> thanks controller
[2:22:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:22:38] <+Frazzyfraznor> I love this next area
[2:22:39] <FutaSnek> THATS THE TAKEAWAY?
[2:22:42] <bear_breaker20> but y was she so big
[2:22:43] <thebalticguy1> Sell it???
[2:22:45] <+Grayhammatter> STONKS
[2:22:46] <munitalprats> @brunoberserk technically you can stealth kill her after her shadow attacks, or use snap seeds to remove it
[2:22:47] <+nabs2099> @brunoberserk she's actually super hot under the mask
[2:22:53] <%Theycallmenerf> Elden Ring leaks> Sekiro
[2:22:54] <ullyzeez> woolie is gonna get overwhelmed at the next part LUL
[2:22:54] <thebalticguy1> It means vendors are better
[2:22:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> She a rich bitch who guards other rich immortal assholes
[2:22:55] <pi_in_the_sci> it unlocks stuff at the shops
[2:22:56] <Lobster_Lord> Next zone is amazing Kreygasm
[2:22:59] <munitalprats> she's a guardian of big monk energy
[2:23:02] <Indigo_Automaton> It's a vendor upgrade
[2:23:03] <thebalticguy1> BEST ZONE
[2:23:07] <Solidnick18> it's a dope area
[2:23:07] <jetjagger222> didnt the senpou temple mummy monks also have centipedes
[2:23:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @brunoberserk was a regular monk, she got corrupted by something, became immortal, guards this area
[2:23:08] <Flare3500> Woolie has to grind
[2:23:11] <thebalticguy1> not yet
[2:23:13] <Ashenik1> best zone
[2:23:13] <munitalprats> I dont think this is an endpoint
[2:23:16] <primaryfire> you have until the end of the next area before you're locked out of it
[2:23:17] <munitalprats> the end point is VERY CLEAR
[2:23:18] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus do you have the Spiritfalls yet?
[2:23:19] <ullyzeez> ah fuck
[2:23:20] <andre11dr> Now for the Irathil of the game
[2:23:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Up until the final boss of the area
[2:23:27] <bear_breaker20> wolf must be like 5'1''
[2:23:35] <NiSoKr> Point of no return is the boss of this area
[2:23:35] <+krispen_wa> IS THIS ANOR LONDO?
[2:23:42] <thebalticguy1> priestess????
[2:23:42] <Flare3500> Yao she's a bitch
[2:23:44] <+krispen_wa> Yaoza!
[2:23:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Priestess
[2:23:49] <%Lion_kun> Just don't do the final boss.
[2:23:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This is better than Anor Londo
[2:23:53] <Solidnick18> oh
[2:24:05] <Indigo_Automaton> *Priestess
[2:24:06] <andre11dr> But behind the mask, she the bomb
[2:24:09] <OblivionSword1> Priestess Woolie not Princess
[2:24:11] <munitalprats> woolie is gonna LOVE THIS PLACE
[2:24:23] <+Burdenslo> Anor londo isn’t even that good of an area
[2:24:26] <+nabs2099> Idk about woolie but I love ohohoho princess trope
[2:24:28] <Lobster_Lord> Mist Noble is the hardest boss
[2:24:30] <chronoxgp> Yah-oy
[2:24:31] <munitalprats> this area is way cooler than anor londo

[2:25:05] <andre11dr> You could say Woolie is BACK IN
[2:25:23] <Shwepie> I do like that you can get a free deathblow on the second health bar for Corrupted Monk. It might be too well hidden though.

[2:29:16] <+dom3800> Don't backseat so much guys
[2:29:21] <+nabs2099> I swear Sekiro really didn't utilise it's stealth mechanics properly for the most part.
[2:29:24] <Lobster_Lord> FEEL THE SUCK
[2:29:24] <vVAstrAVv> litterally just kill it woolie theyre pushovers
[2:29:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh advice: "There is a bar"
[2:29:27] <thebalticguy1> Woolie you are gonna want to use stealth
[2:29:29] <JayCue_yt> "If It's a matter of sucking, I might as well kill you." - Woolie, 2021

[2:29:54] <wqorst> uhh
[2:29:56] <andre11dr> " Remember Snake, This is a sneaking mission"
[2:29:57] <+krispen_wa> hmmmm
[2:30:05] <%SainEdge> the "counter" attack in old-mode is the best
[2:30:07] <Johannen> @nabs2099 Realy? I got the opposite idea, i used stealth to my advantage everywhere
[2:30:12] <+nabs2099> @kohei_kyouji Honestly not even here. Most of the time I legit just run through unimpeded.
[2:30:15] <munitalprats> YEYEYEYE
[2:30:16] <munitalprats> KABUKI FUCKERS
[2:30:17] <ullyzeez> its sooo big

[2:30:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> TOMOE LORE
[2:30:45] <ullyzeez> TONY LAZUTO?!
[2:30:52] <Solidnick18> Tony lozuto?
[2:30:54] <+nabs2099> @johannen That's fair but I don't think the game utilised the mechanic to its fullest, more like an afterthought.
[2:30:54] <crazzmatazz2> graduated from "what was that noise" to "there was no noise"
[2:30:57] <Kohei_kyouji> @nabs2099 generally i throw on the sugar that improves stealth and then just run and kill stuff fast
[2:30:59] <+krispen_wa> Anyway, the whole operation is ru-
[2:30:59] <$QueequegTheater> TONY LAZUTO
[2:31:05] <+krispen_wa> WHAT WAS THAT
[2:31:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> The whole operation is being run by Lady Tomoe
[2:31:09] <%nosubstancex> The next bonfire allows for a good exp grind area. Where you can just stealth everything
[2:31:16] <Ultimatefool> He's over 40 feet back, he ain't suspicious
[2:31:18] <GoogleyGareth> Must be my imagination
[2:31:19] <$QueequegTheater> ANyway, the whole operat-
[2:31:20] <+seithri> must've been the wind
[2:31:20] <crazzmatazz2> @TheRealGreaterGamer tomoe dlc when
[2:31:21] <+nabs2099> @kohei_kyouji That's also a super great way to basically negate the need for stealth lol
[2:31:25] <+penjaza> Take a swim
[2:31:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @crazzmatazz2 Never ;_;
[2:31:40] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like the game didn't make losing posture yourself dangerous enough
[2:31:41] <crazzmatazz2> never ever
[2:31:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> UNLESS SEQUEL?
[2:31:43] <Kohei_kyouji> @nabs2099 sadly, yeah
[2:31:45] <Flare3500> Your sword looks really cool too
[2:31:49] <andre11dr> Tomoe feels like she was meant to be DLC but they never did DLC for this
[2:31:55] <Lobster_Lord> Puppeteer is my fav
[2:31:58] <munitalprats> bloodsmoke is good for stealth murder and puppeteer is the best
[2:32:01] <redrins> that bestowal shit can deal chip damage and kill spear minibosses like they're nothing
[2:32:04] <+TopTieramisu> tomoe is a velka
[2:32:06] <Kohei_kyouji> @nabs2099 id probably be harsher on the game for it but i actually hate stealth to begin with
[2:32:07] <+krispen_wa> Sekiro feels both complete and also incomplete
[2:32:08] <ullyzeez> @andre11dr not story DLC at least
[2:32:09] <+nabs2099> @therealgreatergamer Damn so no way to cuck Genichiro even more?
[2:32:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> feelsbad
[2:32:40] <crazzmatazz2> yeaaaaaah
[2:32:42] <Kohei_kyouji> @redrins also it looks cool >_>
[2:32:49] <Indigo_Automaton> RAD
[2:32:50] <Lobster_Lord> I couldn't definitely see Sekiro getting a sequel. Maybe set in China from the Dragon homecoming ending
[2:32:57] <+TopTieramisu> ichimonji op
[2:32:59] <crazzmatazz2> that double blow was the one i used for a majority of the game too
[2:33:01] <Kohei_kyouji> @redrins it looks like what bloodbornes chikage SHOULD hav been
[2:33:03] <$QueequegTheater> Yeah they have a big startup on the succ that gives you time to close the distance
[2:33:04] <Kohei_kyouji> *have
[2:33:05] <Flare3500> Sekiro Journey to the West
[2:33:06] <+matteasy31> S U C C
[2:33:15] <munitalprats> I think it was another one succing you
[2:33:16] <thebalticguy1> He turned around tho
[2:33:17] <munitalprats> aswell
[2:33:20] <munitalprats> and he was turning around
[2:33:20] <+nabs2099> @kohei_kyouji I love stealth so it's definitely one of the things this game disappointed me on. Also repeated bosses, dragonrot not mattering and a few other problems make this imo the weakest From game. still an easy 8/10 tho.
[2:33:22] <ullyzeez> succ the front
[2:33:25] <%ChoculaUltra> Sekiro would've made a cool guest boss in Nioh 2
[2:33:25] <+krispen_wa> More games need to be Journey to the West
[2:33:26] <redrins> @Kohei_kyouji true
[2:33:28] <thebalticguy1> They have to be facing you
[2:33:29] <Flare3500> He succ real hard
[2:33:33] <elmo_s_friend> retroANIME
[2:33:43] <NiSoKr> He turned around
[2:33:43] <+RJay80> Frontal suck hggGasm
[2:33:57] <+TopTieramisu> i'd rather have the last boss from sekiro in nioh 2
[2:34:02] <andre11dr> I hope that JTW game is real, but i really doubt it
[2:34:02] <%mousesorcerer> quiettNoice quiettNoice quiettNoice quiettNoice
[2:34:07] <SixthSun2> They are fish people
[2:34:12] <+krispen_wa> Okay, but imagine Hayabusa in Sekiro as a boss
[2:34:14] <Johannen> Punished Woolie
[2:34:18] <thebalticguy1> COOLEST ENEMIES
[2:34:20] <BaslerJones> has woolie fought monkey yet
[2:34:21] <@Solidus_113> monke
[2:34:23] <+nabs2099> @krispen_wa YO
[2:34:26] <jetjagger222> zoras except not sexy
[2:34:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> can't wait for Elden Ring
[2:34:27] <Lobster_Lord> if woolie pieces the lore together, he can learn their weakness
[2:34:31] <ullyzeez> you NEED to stop panic jumping man
[2:34:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What are these people called again? Okami?
[2:34:45] <+dom3800> @TheRealGreaterGamer yeah Okami
[2:34:56] <+nabs2099> doesn't Okami mean Wolf?
[2:35:01] <+krispen_wa> Their weakness is being too long of a game then
[2:35:02] <+poto2222> Okami was a great game tbh
[2:35:02] <Ashenik1> these fucking dogs...
[2:35:02] <ullyzeez> isnt that japanese for wolf?
[2:35:06] <jetjagger222> prolly different kanji
[2:35:08] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can switch Jump with Dash, that helped me also
[2:35:10] <$QueequegTheater> Dash is just as bad as jumping, there's almost no iframes
[2:35:10] <+TopTieramisu> the jump button messed with my head when i started sekiro
[2:35:15] <+dom3800> @nabs2099 Different Kanji I think
[2:35:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Electrike
[2:35:15] <munitalprats> you super can
[2:35:17] <crazzmatazz2> i thought okami was also sun god
[2:35:18] <LaughingCatt> Okami can mean multiple things, depending on the kanji
[2:35:19] <andre11dr> Well they are serving the Okami or something like that
[2:35:19] <thebalticguy1> sprint it
[2:35:20] <munitalprats> from higher up
[2:35:22] <munitalprats> sprint jump
[2:35:33] <%earthischeese> maybe the kanji for god or up
[2:35:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[2:35:39] <+nabs2099> @dom3800 Oh that's how kanji works? That's p cool
[2:35:39] <SixthSun2> Hey Vsauce, Michael here. You can't make that stealth jump.... or can you?
[2:35:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He died of fear
[2:35:45] <vVAstrAVv> oki can see how nioh habits would fuck you here lol
[2:35:46] <+Grayhammatter> uh...
[2:35:47] <jetjagger222> pupper snuffer
[2:35:48] <+TopTieramisu> dogs are not the beasts they are in souls
[2:35:49] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie they're dogs
[2:35:49] <+Grayhammatter> what?
[2:35:50] <brunoberserk> thats a ugly dog
[2:35:51] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[2:35:52] <Coystick> Muh livers
[2:35:52] <thebalticguy1> You hit them both
[2:35:56] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:35:57] <+nabs2099> Dags. I like DAGS.
[2:36:02] <+dom3800> @nabs2099 Yeah, makes it's a pain to learn though xD
[2:36:14] <ullyzeez> oh you like that shit?
[2:36:17] <NiSoKr> Dogs die to a shuriken
[2:36:24] <netrac> *smirk*
[2:36:26] <+Rekinsinn> which game woolie talking about?
[2:36:28] <Johannen> What is Woolie talking about?
[2:36:29] <Flare3500> Some Avatar the last airbender shit lightning reflect
[2:36:30] <+TopTieramisu> i like how talks about it like the asura path is the default path
[2:36:31] <thebalticguy1> Yeah I wish the game had more of that
[2:36:31] <andre11dr> Man,dogs are such a joke in this game
[2:36:33] <munitalprats> wdym? genichiro does it?
[2:36:34] <jetjagger222> it was the same way in tenchu
[2:36:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheRealGreaterGamer
[2:36:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what fight
[2:36:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:36:41] <+nabs2099> Yeah. too bad lightning reversal never returns.
[2:36:41] <Go4theKnees> The dragon boss
[2:36:46] <munitalprats> you get it right before the genichiro fight
[2:36:49] <+nabs2099> tooootally never returns.
[2:36:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Maybe he should beat this game..... ;)
[2:36:52] <MeMillionthDollar> LUCKY
[2:36:54] <Ashenik1> @nabs2099  :<
[2:37:00] <Johannen> Woolie forgot half this shiz
[2:37:00] <NiSoKr> Yeah too bad it only happens once in the entire game and never again
[2:37:07] <Coystick> Blue Zangiefs
[2:37:09] <+krispen_wa> so the Divine Dragon is best gimmick boss in Souls yeah?
[2:37:12] <andre11dr> So i guess that means Woolie beat Gun Saint
[2:37:16] <thebalticguy1> No you see it earlier
[2:37:19] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie's memory is lying to him
[2:37:19] <vVAstrAVv> yes it is
[2:37:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there's one before that
[2:37:25] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Genichiro uses in his third phase
[2:37:25] <munitalprats> woolies memory is super lying to him
[2:37:29] <thebalticguy1> The first time you fight genichiro
[2:37:31] <ullyzeez> genichiro does it
[2:37:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> AND THATS IT ;)
[2:37:37] <$QueequegTheater> @andre11dr He's mixing up Genichiro and Owl
[2:37:42] <+TopTieramisu> divine dragon was a more fun fight but storm king fight is so cool visually
[2:37:46] <andre11dr> Oh ,ok
[2:37:52] <NumbF4ke> Yeah the lighting phase happens always
[2:37:59] <thebalticguy1> No thats way earlier
[2:38:06] <cobalt_phoenix_> no you're mixing events together
[2:38:08] <Flare3500> Alright time to replay the entire game
[2:38:12] <$QueequegTheater> Brains, huh?
[2:38:14] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You fight Emma then A BADASS in shura path
[2:38:15] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa  the most clean and visally stunning but the storm king is still awesome
[2:38:16] <MeMillionthDollar> Woolie a bit rusty, but i LOVE IT
[2:38:18] <$QueequegTheater> Weird things
[2:38:19] <+dom3800> Oh wait, woolies already done the Asura ending?
[2:38:21] <+poto2222> Man, I missed him beating the Monk, I guess it was kinda quick!
[2:38:27] <+nabs2099> Emma qt
[2:38:35] <ullyzeez> halfway yeah but on NG+ its like 30 mins in LUL
[2:38:38] <thebalticguy1> OF COURSE YOU CAN
[2:38:44] <$QueequegTheater> You don't block, you just swing to redirect
[2:38:50] <Flare3500> Yes lightning can be deflected Avatar the last airbender
[2:38:50] <munitalprats> you dont block
[2:38:52] <munitalprats> you get hit in the air
[2:38:57] <Coystick> Heel liver
[2:38:58] <Johannen> @QueequegTheater You block to not get damaged
[2:39:06] <munitalprats> you intentionally take it into your body and swing it out
[2:39:06] <shinichizio> I'd have sworn you need to block the lightning too.
[2:39:17] <Shwepie> Heighch Eel Liver.
[2:39:19] <Lobster_Lord> ookami refers to wolf, okami is deity i think. minor pronunciation and kanji difference
[2:39:21] <Peyote_> you can hold block in the air and then deflect it
[2:39:21] <$QueequegTheater> @Johannen I literally beat the game yesterday, you don't take damage until you touch the ground
[2:39:25] <MeMillionthDollar> cmon BIG lightning
[2:39:27] <+krispen_wa> I wonder if my dog ever realizes I'm snuffing puppers like him when he sits next to me when i play souls games
[2:39:28] <andre11dr> It is good that Woolie remember that ,cause you know, we might play some soccer today
[2:39:32] <Johannen> You dont need to block in air to redirect it , but if you want you can to not lose hp
[2:39:33] <GoogleyGareth> Not enough room I think
[2:39:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> might need to be outside?
[2:39:35] <Peyote_> i actually reccomend doing that so you dont get hit
[2:39:35] <Flare3500> Lightning deflect is very lenient , just jump whether you block or not is not factored in
[2:39:37] <+matteasy31> SourPls
[2:39:37] <thebalticguy1> Woolie he may not do it indoors
[2:39:41] <ullyzeez> (you get other chances to do cool lightning shit woolz)
[2:39:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> might have to be in a more open area
[2:39:42] <MeMillionthDollar> odd
[2:39:43] <%Seancicle> we'll dig his grave
[2:39:48] <LaughingCatt> darn fishdog aint shootin lightning
[2:39:48] <wanderingdain90> You can redirect lightning as long as you don't let it hit your heart
[2:40:04] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just like Iroh taught Sekiro
[2:40:11] <munitalprats> HOO BOY
[2:40:11] <+poto2222> As long as you believe in yourself
[2:40:12] <Flare3500> Remember what Uncle Iroh said when deflecting lightning
[2:40:19] <andre11dr> Or just wear rubber, that will stop lightning too
[2:40:23] <Coystick> I live that Sekiro has a sweet tooth
[2:40:28] <netrac> I am waiting for the bonfire mimic
[2:40:28] <munitalprats> hang on
[2:40:29] <+TopTieramisu> sekiro is basically zuko
[2:40:29] <+matteasy31> JAM SESH
[2:40:30] <Coystick> Love*
[2:40:30] <+Bailey__gaming> ooh time for the whistle bit
[2:40:31] <munitalprats> you have enough for the gourd
[2:40:33] <munitalprats> 2 purses
[2:40:34] <munitalprats> you do
[2:40:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> that's there BECAUSE of the bullshit coming up
[2:40:39] <munitalprats> you picked one up
[2:40:43] <Flare3500> Buy billion of fire emblem
[2:40:44] <ullyzeez> just buy spirit emblems
[2:40:44] <+nabs2099> @andre11dr Only need that if your gf is a lightning goddess
[2:40:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Buy Spirit Emblems since you have so few
[2:40:47] <munitalprats> 2000 for a gourd
[2:41:10] <vVAstrAVv> goard gang
[2:41:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What's he buying?
[2:41:16] <Lobster_Lord> gotta try this game on PS5 for 60fps
[2:41:23] <Johannen> Spirit Emblems then?
[2:41:38] <Johannen> 50...OOOF
[2:41:44] <+nabs2099> @lobster_lord it's a gamechanger dude!
[2:41:47] <Flare3500> I always wanted to learn  the japanese for Estus Flask
[2:42:01] <munitalprats> man, the shuriken and flame vent were my boy
[2:42:03] <$QueequegTheater> He should also have a total of 8 necklaces and 2 beads before Fountainhead
[2:42:06] <vVAstrAVv> estus frasku
[2:42:10] <munitalprats> shuriken was so good because it keeps boss posture up
[2:42:27] <+Bailey__gaming> the enemies in the nice area drop a lot of souls/money so u can farm them for emblem money
[2:42:50] <%Seancicle> mens sana in corpore sanó
[2:42:55] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Listening in on NPC's for more options?
[2:43:05] <vVAstrAVv> im glad nioh doesn't have dumb old spirit emblem
[2:43:09] <$QueequegTheater> He MAAAAY want to rush the phoenix umbrella
[2:43:22] <$QueequegTheater> No reason why Kappa
[2:43:28] <+nabs2099> advanced firecrackers kinda suck
[2:43:32] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, that thing
[2:43:34] <Lobster_Lord> @vVAstrAVv Nioh has a lot of dumb loot tho
[2:43:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He wouldnt be good enough to use it lol
[2:43:38] <+krispen_wa> I love that theres so many non-limited consumables in Nioh
[2:43:48] <ullyzeez> but pretty colors tho
[2:43:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[2:43:48] <Flare3500> Firecracks the decrease armor , are strong just saying
[2:43:49] <Indigo_Automaton> read
[2:43:52] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I guarantee he cheeses DoH anyways lmao
[2:43:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the hold is for the AOE instead of infront
[2:43:55] <vVAstrAVv> just sell the loot. solved
[2:43:56] <munitalprats> they also decrease their defenses
[2:44:02] <+i_zombee> jeez LUL
[2:44:05] <munitalprats> reading is not required :^)
[2:44:07] <%Lion_kun> Make sure you get a path to the whistle.
[2:44:08] <chronoxgp> nioh is like gran turismo in it's ocd
[2:44:20] <Flare3500> TITANITE SLAB basically
[2:44:32] <Lobster_Lord> Spirit emblems aren't even needed to beat the game really
[2:44:32] <ullyzeez> DOH isn't even a fun fight. its really just if you want more Sekiro.
[2:44:33] <andre11dr> Fuck the fire just get the crack man, throw it at those Okami and get yourself a good time
[2:44:36] <@Solidus_113> The axe breaks guard iirc
[2:44:36] <+krispen_wa> im constantly at like 550 inventory in Nioh because Im too scurred to sell all my inheritables
[2:44:39] <$QueequegTheater> Those are NG+ weapons
[2:44:39] <munitalprats> flamevent is dope
[2:44:41] <munitalprats> especially with oil\
[2:44:48] <+Bailey__gaming> Umbrella is realy needed
[2:44:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> flame axe was dope with oil iirc
[2:44:56] <shinichizio> Charged flame hadukens are how I cheesed a lot of minibosses
[2:44:59] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Umbrella is a good upgrade
[2:45:06] <crimsonsaens> The umbrella is very good
[2:45:10] <shinichizio> Obviously Woolie doesn't need that but it was fun to exploding punch things
[2:45:11] <%ChoculaUltra> upgrade the umbrella milord
[2:45:12] <$QueequegTheater> @Bailey__gaming I beat DoH without even knowing about the umbrella on my first run
[2:45:14] <$QueequegTheater> Pain
[2:45:24] <Johannen> Purple Umbrela blocks from Terror
[2:45:26] <Flare3500> Remember Woolie how strong the firecrackers was
[2:45:35] <%Lion_kun> Umbrella and Whistle are OP for DoH
[2:45:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> DoH.... ;)
[2:45:51] <wanderingdain90> firecracker are the shit
[2:45:52] <Lobster_Lord> read to lore on the gun fort ladies for a secret tip
[2:45:57] <+krispen_wa> Why is everyone talking about Disciple of the Hand?
[2:45:58] <Lobster_Lord> the lore*
[2:46:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man I can't believe how underwhelming the spear felt from what i can remember
[2:46:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[2:46:09] <$QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa I prefer gathering to crafting
[2:46:11] <andre11dr> DoH ,more like second hand Lawrence
[2:46:19] <+nabs2099> @cobalt_phoenix_ Nah spear is rad
[2:46:28] <$QueequegTheater> DoH is easily the worst boss in the game for me
[2:46:28] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you can keep using mortal draw with no emblems, it's just weaker
[2:46:31] <ullyzeez> a weak version is free wool
[2:46:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @nabs2099 I must've used it wrong then
[2:46:42] <+nabs2099> Maybe? Idk.
[2:46:46] <Johannen> Dragonspring Sake from Mibu Village?
[2:46:47] <+TopTieramisu> either die a hero or see yourself become a pat
[2:46:47] <+LeaIsChill> Yeah ofc
[2:46:52] <$QueequegTheater> It also looks FUCKING RAD
[2:46:55] <Flare3500> The visual effects disappear
[2:47:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Badger?
[2:47:10] <Flare3500> that's the downside of mortal blade without emblems
[2:47:16] <%sporeian94> Bottomless Hole? More like my ex-wife
[2:47:17] <+nabs2099> @solidus_113 ey thanks for relaying that man!
[2:47:22] <vVAstrAVv> implying pat was ever anything but a pat
[2:47:50] <Lobster_Lord> be honest guys, how long did it take you to kill the invisible 4th monkey?
[2:47:52] <+LeaIsChill> Pat's the kind of Sekiro player to never use emblems in the first place bc it expends them LUL
[2:47:55] <%Lion_kun> Woolie should go to the path to mibu village.
[2:48:02] <andre11dr> I think the Monkeys are the worst boss for me ,the first time they are annoying and once you know what to ,the fight might ass well not exist
[2:48:07] <munitalprats> cures the dragonrot
[2:48:11] <%Seancicle> quid?
[2:48:15] <red_fox_zero> Dragonrot cure.
[2:48:22] <+DappercatEsquire> it's a cough drop
[2:48:25] <+TopTieramisu> i wish dragon rot had more dire consequences
[2:48:25] <+Bailey__gaming> Confetti is super useful
[2:48:27] <%ChoculaUltra> man, I remember playing thinking the dragonrot mechanic would be huge LUL
[2:48:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> boy I wish we had that now
[2:48:29] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Dragonspring Sake from Mibu Village Mob?
[2:48:30] <Flare3500> but those plhegm tho
[2:48:31] <%jepupu> Cough drops let you continue side quests
[2:48:34] <munitalprats> yes
[2:48:36] <+nabs2099> @toptieramisu same
[2:48:37] <munitalprats> you need it to fight headless.
[2:48:38] <%Lion_kun> You can buy it now.
[2:48:39] <+Hatorade626> YEEEEEEEEEESSS I started playing this again last week.
[2:48:41] <$QueequegTheater> You have so many now
[2:48:43] <Flare3500> You need them to fight ass rapers as I call them
[2:48:44] <red_fox_zero> Stops the storyline for the infected, too.
[2:48:45] <Kory_Here> infinite now
[2:48:47] <ronin19xx> It was horrible design
[2:48:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tally board you picked up now lets you buy it from merchants
[2:48:54] <Indigo_Automaton> The Purple Flamevent and SHield can fight Headless too
[2:48:58] <jetjagger222> fat bastards
[2:49:07] <%Lion_kun> You can buy it now since you beat the Monk
[2:49:08] <andre11dr> I wouldn't even bother with the headless
[2:49:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck that mask, i wasted levels on it
[2:49:21] <Lobster_Lord> if you kill the headless you get a nice reward
[2:49:27] <Flare3500> Yup Minh is right , conver exp to strength
[2:49:30] <wanderingdain90> The headless give free prostate exams
[2:49:32] <vVAstrAVv> headless are limited in number dont bother at this point
[2:49:41] <$QueequegTheater> By the time you get all the skill, skill points cost so much XP that you'd be at like NG+5
[2:49:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It's useless, basically it only exists to give experience a purpose on ng plus 5
[2:49:51] <vVAstrAVv> with upgrades for them i mean
[2:50:08] <+TopTieramisu> i hate the headless
[2:50:16] <munitalprats> i would just upgrade everything
[2:50:17] <munitalprats> but that's just me
[2:50:20] <$QueequegTheater> One of the final skills costs like fucking 9 skill points
[2:50:28] <+TopTieramisu> make them sneaky? fine. but don't give me delay based netcode movement
[2:50:29] <andre11dr> headless are easily the worst thing in this game
[2:50:35] <vVAstrAVv> headless aren't bad. at least 3 are free kills
[2:50:36] <$QueequegTheater> WHAT
[2:50:38] <$QueequegTheater> WHAT IS THIS
[2:50:39] <+Gallhint> Headless just aren't fun to fight
[2:50:43] <+Gallhint> The water ones are so easy
[2:50:45] <Shwepie> Best map.
[2:50:53] <%ChoculaUltra> it sure is pretty tho
[2:50:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:50:54] <+matteasy31> LUL
[2:50:54] <+yukichocomilk> I love this map LUL
[2:50:54] <$QueequegTheater> When the fuck did they add that
[2:51:00] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Map: Go fuck yourself, figure it out.
[2:51:02] <Indigo_Automaton> Sowthern
[2:51:03] <Fareflight_> One of the biggest problems I have with this game is farming. I just cheat engine in the rest of the skills once I beat a NG cycle.
[2:51:10] <shinichizio> The Useless Manual Map's been in since 1.00. It's great.
[2:51:12] <Shwepie> @QueequegTheater It's always been in the game.
[2:51:18] <Fareflight_> Don't want to grind in a single player action game.
[2:51:21] <$QueequegTheater> How the fuck did I miss that
[2:51:24] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, the farming aspect of the game is a real drag. Fulminating bullshit
[2:51:24] <wanderingdain90> The headless are kind of a joke after beating a few bosses.
[2:51:26] <+krispen_wa> Why does a game that has no builds have so much farming
[2:51:30] <dinnydanny777> Ocarina of Time looking map
[2:51:50] <+LeaIsChill> @krispen_wa GOTY mechanics include "spending time on nothing"
[2:51:52] <Lobster_Lord> i appreciate those old school maps for context
[2:51:54] <%Seancicle> 👆🏻👉🏻
[2:52:02] <Flare3500> The Headless are to get reusable sugars
[2:52:10] <+Gallhint> Are monk playthroughs still OP?
[2:52:19] <munitalprats> here we gooooooooooooo
[2:52:25] <vVAstrAVv> monk?
[2:52:28] <+LeaIsChill> yes actually tho
[2:52:33] <+matteasy31> THEY JAMMIN
[2:52:36] <+YabbaTroll> ?
[2:52:38] <+TopTieramisu> i wish stealth was more incorporated into boss fights
[2:52:40] <+matteasy31> WALL HACKS
[2:52:43] <Indigo_Automaton> !
[2:52:43] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[2:52:45] <Shwepie> @Gallhint They nerfed punching pretty significantly in the first patch.
[2:52:45] <Fareflight_> They looked at everyone hating Item Discovery in the dark souls games and from was like "Hmm how can we make this way worse for them".
[2:52:48] <andre11dr> Yeah the farming is dumb, this is a action game but they still wanted to throw some old stuff like that in
[2:52:48] <+TopTieramisu> it feels so divorced from the the boss encounters
[2:53:08] <+krispen_wa> Imagine a Mr. Freeze type stealth boss here. it would be so good
[2:53:11] <$QueequegTheater> moshi moshi
[2:53:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> moshi
[2:53:17] <Flare3500> speak english bitch
[2:53:27] <GoogleyGareth> Be careful you're knocking over my shit
[2:53:34] <andre11dr> @flare3500 This is Japan bruh
[2:53:39] <vVAstrAVv> why do action game players just vomit at the mere idea of menus or farming lol
[2:53:42] <Flare3500> but Robert tho
[2:53:46] <%ChoculaUltra> that sweet sweet youth
[2:53:52] <andre11dr> He ain't Japan
[2:53:52] <+FuqBoiSlim> @vvastravv no menu only fight
[2:53:53] <+krispen_wa> Because its an action game. not an rpg
[2:53:53] <+cubbywolf> damn nobles
[2:53:57] <+nabs2099> @vvastravv Cos it's boring as shit
[2:53:58] <shinichizio> "Welcome to Flute Town, try sneaking"
[2:53:59] <$QueequegTheater> @vVAstrAVv because having to grind in a single player game is stupid
[2:54:03] <Johannen> @VvTacoSaladvV Cause it breaks the pacing and kills momentum of the game
[2:54:13] <%Parapattern> That's just what all old rich people do
[2:54:14] <$QueequegTheater> @Johannen wrong user
[2:54:18] <wibbwobbler> LUL

[3:05:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yooo how's it goin?
[3:05:49] <+TopTieramisu> if a boss isn't asking where you're looking, are they truly a boss?
[3:05:55] <+DappercatEsquire> uh... yata
[3:06:17] <shinichizio> "I see you. I can't get up there, but I see you. WHERE'D HE GO"

[3:06:59] <+DappercatEsquire> many mikiri
[3:07:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I like how Woolie is allergic to crouching in stealth sections but he'll do it randomly during boss fights
[3:07:36] <+Gallhint> @KeiganOfAstora theres still a good bit to go
[3:07:39] <ronin19xx> 1 2 3 Ichimonji
[3:07:40] <+TopTieramisu> squatting is reserved for teabagging
[3:07:49] <thebalticguy1> Woolie why do you not crouch when attemoting to stealth
[3:08:23] <+nabs2099> @thebalticguy1 Cos stealth is practically useless in this game
[3:08:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Man these people are weird
[3:08:30] <Flare3500> If you're gonna throw a rock might as well throw a shuriken

[3:09:24] <+cubbywolf> slide more
[3:09:27] <shinichizio> Does Woolie have Suppress Sound?
[3:09:37] <+nabs2099> @andre11dr Why fight?
[3:09:38] <OblivionSword1> Woolie has suppres presence
[3:09:47] <+cubbywolf> i remember this fight
[3:09:50] <Johannen> I dont think Woolie does have supress sound, that's the upgrade from the supres presense
[3:09:56] <+cubbywolf> damn nobles
[3:09:57] <Flare3500> Run towards the end of the world Woolie to avoid the succ
[3:10:03] <CalusRaccoon> @FuqBoiSlim please do! It's really interesting. Vaati on youtube has a nice comprehensive series of videos for the lore of this game
[3:10:05] <ronin19xx> CHEESE IT HARD
[3:10:11] <Indigo_Automaton> Not here

[3:10:27] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus He can, you are required to gain that ability to gain accsess to this area
[3:10:27] <+b_aleph> IRL?
[3:10:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> @calusraccoon I'll def check it out

[3:11:40] <The_Nerd_Supreme> b hole clenched
[3:11:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie jumpblocking is a subconcious take LUL
[3:11:58] <%Lion_kun> don't jump immediately, wait like a half second, the moment the danger sign disappears
[3:11:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1367290649544908805
[3:12:05] <CalusRaccoon> These are the legendary warriors that Tomoe learned her lightning style from!
[3:12:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Does deflecting prevent the damage? Or is the only way to avoid the lightning damage via Mist Raven?
[3:12:12] <munitalprats> you *cant* block lightning
[3:12:15] <munitalprats> thats the point
[3:12:16] <%Lion_kun> deflecting doesn't rpevent damage
[3:12:20] <wibbwobbler> me too lmao
[3:12:24] <munitalprats> you're redirecting it
[3:12:24] <+shinaobi> if you're on the ground you take the full hit
[3:12:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You still take a little damage, but not much
[3:12:32] <ullyzeez> yup defintely scientific
[3:12:33] <+krispen_wa> You...did it.
[3:12:36] <Indigo_Automaton> Well done
[3:12:37] <%Lion_kun> reverse the lightning is the coolest mechanic in the game
[3:12:44] <+patel347> tell him about the hole minh
[3:12:45] <+patel347> yeah
[3:12:47] <%Lion_kun> i wish you could sue it more

[3:13:55] <MeMillionthDollar> Sip Sip
[3:13:58] <munitalprats> it do be sake
[3:14:07] <Johannen> You can block the lightning attack in the air to prevent the damage, often that damage is not a lot, so people tend to ignore the blocking part
[3:14:13] <+cubbywolf> precious scales
[3:14:14] <VJdarkworld> magimagicarpcarp
[3:14:15] <+Gallhint> If only there was a really really thirsty npc to give that to

[3:16:23] <ullyzeez> nah
[3:16:25] <Klefth> Nah
[3:16:28] <+cubbywolf> ichimonji is good everywhere
[3:16:32] <+cubbywolf> facts
[3:16:32] <+nabs2099> NOTHING is better than Mortal Draw except HIGH MONK
[3:16:33] <Lobster_Lord> it just looks cool
[3:16:38] <+b_aleph> Double mortal draw is the besto always
[3:16:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Shadowrush is a very anime move
[3:16:48] <VJdarkworld> its senpou kicks vs. ichimonji
[3:16:49] <+izacklok> ichimonji is ez mode
[3:16:55] <+nabs2099> EMP MORT DRAW
[3:16:58] <ronin19xx> Ichimonji is the best
[3:16:59] <+cubbywolf> i take ichi off to have fun
[3:17:00] <andre11dr> But Singer is a level 3 so it must be good
[3:17:05] <+cubbywolf> i put ichi on to win
[3:17:06] <munitalprats> but you need to get ichimonji double
[3:17:09] <munitalprats> and the upgrades
[3:17:16] <munitalprats> so it doesnt neccessarily win out on EXP
[3:17:36] <+cubbywolf> praying strikes is really good too
[3:17:47] <Flare3500> buy spirit emblems
[3:17:49] <VJdarkworld> double ichimonji is hubris, does lots o damage, but can easily get u killed
[3:17:53] <+cubbywolf> but its just a lesser ichi
[3:18:01] <andre11dr> buy fire emblem
[3:18:06] <+nabs2099> Don't need ichi when I got high monk
[3:18:06] <brunoberserk> buy emblems
[3:18:06] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus DragonSpring Sake from Mibu Village for cool dialogue?
[3:18:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Buy Three Houses

[3:22:01] <Lobster_Lord> try sabimaru on these guys
[3:22:02] <munitalprats> if you leave the car its far more likely you'll die

[3:23:23] <Gelphaze> Woolie can stealth attack the beast if he can get behind it and use the firecrackers, it will give you a free hit.
[3:23:47] <%Noonoox12> Earlier in the stream I thought he mentioned "just caring about the bosses", so that's what I meant, at least

[3:32:22] <munitalprats> CAMERA
[3:32:26] <thebalticguy1> Ichimonji doesnt do enough health damage, use regular attacks instead
[3:32:28] <VJdarkworld> double ichimonji into getting hit = true combo
[3:32:29] <stevenellis386> the firecrackers do nothing
[3:32:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Does confetti prevent that chip?
[3:32:31] <munitalprats> dont do ichimonji
[3:32:39] <ronin19xx> Unga bunga pig

[3:32:55] <enddword> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:32:56] <+cubbywolf> sigh
[3:33:02] <+cubbywolf> just run and stealth him again
[3:33:12] <munitalprats> yes they are
[3:33:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:33:17] <munitalprats> you're not stuck in an animation
[3:33:30] <+BettyMwwaahh> locking on makes hitting it harder when it rears up after firecracker
[3:33:46] <%Kaito_Cam> remember when he said he would not need to buy more of the stuff
[3:33:51] <andre11dr> Now this made sense in Ashima castle, but who the fuck tied that magic tree trunk to his head?
[3:33:55] <munitalprats> alright go do ichimonji and eat a hit every time :^)
[3:33:55] <ullyzeez> @cubbywolf yeah cant this fight be cheesed like that?
[3:33:59] <ReaderWatcherPlayer> The head takes double damage
[3:34:01] <Johannen> You either eat chip or you eat shit on the punished dodge
[3:34:06] <munitalprats> you need to hit the face
[3:34:07] <+cubbywolf> nah it resets it's HP you can only stealth it once
[3:34:20] <+b_aleph> @andre11dr Reggie
[3:34:21] <Flare3500> This is the Original Bull in ashina that died and got resurrected here
[3:34:22] <+cubbywolf> but it reset so woolie hasnt even reached the stealth dmg yet
[3:34:26] <munitalprats> you're gonna zone it out
[3:34:30] <+cubbywolf> just wasting resources
[3:34:37] <%Skullgod> Why does woolie not simply eat the bull
[3:34:43] <yeahthatalex> You need to hit and run, don't fight him like you have a stamina bar
[3:34:44] <+nabs2099> @flare3500 That's just cruel lmao
[3:34:44] <+cubbywolf> its going to reset again when he gets to far from its zone
[3:34:49] <Shwepie> @andre11dr What if it's the same bull?
[3:34:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Bull-jitsu
[3:34:55] <Klefth> Dude
[3:34:57] <Klefth> lol
[3:35:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Flare3500 Not sure if that can be true since this area isnt really an "afterlife"
[3:35:18] <SixthSun2> Y'all are asking who put this tree on this bull, but I'm asking "Why does this bull have a SKULL FACE?"
[3:35:20] <+cubbywolf> wack it with your sw0rd
[3:35:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> But Im not sure either, this bull is weird for lore
[3:35:23] <Johannen> Would Purple Umbrella block his attacks fully?
[3:35:30] <TonberryLives> Ichi will raise the posture meter faster
[3:35:32] <laguerrilha> Dont really like this boss, he is slow to deal
[3:35:34] <shinichizio> Such a lust for sakura! Whooooooo!

[3:49:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Spam
[3:49:30] <+cubbywolf> stamina is great
[3:49:38] <Indigo_Automaton> Get gud Minh
[3:49:38] <%SainEdge> spammer DansGame
[3:49:47] <KingOfTheGeats> mastering ki pulse is fun
[3:49:48] <+b_aleph> just ki pulse
[3:49:51] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:49:51] <vVAstrAVv> just master ki pulse minh you can spam all day
[3:49:54] <+krispen_wa> Minh would love dual swords then because you can spam that shit forever
[3:50:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The surge sucked tho
[3:50:03] <+cubbywolf> the stamina in Nioh is actually dif from most sols like
[3:50:11] <+yukichocomilk> just get good minh LUL
[3:50:11] <+cubbywolf> you can spam more in nioh for sure
[3:50:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Nioh is aggressive anti spam haha
[3:50:16] <%Josef_Stryker> @krispen_wa Tonfa's even better for that
[3:50:19] <%Lion_kun> nioh let's you regen stamina if you're good enough
[3:50:24] <+cubbywolf> if you can ki pulse
[3:50:31] <Lobster_Lord> Sekiro has no stamina bar, while Nioh is all bout the stamina bar, yet people try to act like these are similar games.
[3:50:41] <%Lion_kun> or you could do what I did which was make a tank regen build
[3:50:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol and you're open to finishers
[3:50:51] <%Lion_kun> also in nioh 2 you can counter out of the tired state
[3:50:54] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:51:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> God I just hope when he crosses the bridge he doesnt botch the camera like he always does
[3:51:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> its basically instant death
[3:51:14] <+cubbywolf> just get 2/3rd of your hp gone because you blocked at low staminas
[3:51:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Ash Lake PSTD
[3:51:37] <+cubbywolf> use that and you can run up to enemies and stab them
[3:51:40] <+krispen_wa> Yokai Abilities help alleviate that in Nioh 2
[3:51:48] <%zanzibar_junker> Nioh 2 you can Royal Guard your stamina
[3:51:59] <soul_overdrive> I think with stamina system is like a challenge to adapt and improve the way you fight
[3:52:10] <Raldavar> there are skills in Nioh that encourages you to lose all your stamina and end up winded
[3:52:16] <+cubbywolf> SHINOBI
[3:52:20] <vVAstrAVv> also using demon skills in nioh 2 lets uou stay offensive while your ki recovers. so it can just be nonstop
[3:52:21] <+cubbywolf> oh tenchu
[3:52:26] <+cubbywolf> you only exist as skills

[4:02:27] <Shwepie> It originally didn't, then they added it in because that's what "souls" games have.

[4:15:07] <Solidnick18> oooh
[4:15:23] <TonberryLives> Hey guys, does Woolie have access to that one boss at Hirata?
[4:15:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:15:26] <MeMillionthDollar> straight down thru roof
[4:15:30] <Indigo_Automaton> @cobalt_phoenix_ Wait so the idol deactivated then? It's been awhile since I played
[4:15:39] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:15:43] <+cubbywolf> that was great
[4:15:55] <ullyzeez> just hit him wtf
[4:15:58] <thebalticguy1> @Indigo_Automaton they all deactivate when the castle resets
[4:16:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Indigo_Automaton yeah they do that when certain changes occur in areas to require you to walk through zones with new enemies
[4:16:23] <Johannen> Blackhat Badger is at Sunken Valley Cavern Idol
[4:16:24] <stormhawk9891> I'm starting to think Ichimonji isn't as good as people say it is
[4:16:36] <stormhawk9891> Just a thought
[4:16:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because Ichimonji has a long startup it leaves you open
[4:16:44] <+cubbywolf> nah its the best
[4:16:50] <Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton Gotcha, I knew it happened late game after the palace. Didn't realize it occurred this early
[4:16:57] <%Lion_kun> good trade
[4:16:58] <VJdarkworld> @stormhawk9891 ichimonji into getting hit = true combo Kappa
[4:16:59] <ullyzeez> F
[4:17:02] <thebalticguy1> Woolie stop relying on Ichimonji
[4:17:05] <vVAstrAVv> BODIED
[4:17:14] <Johannen> Blackhat Badger is at Sunken Valley Cavern Idol
[4:17:18] <thebalticguy1> he left
[4:17:18] <+cubbywolf> the door?
[4:17:19] <+thedreampie> too late
[4:17:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he moved
[4:17:20] <Johannen> Please help
[4:17:21] <Johannen> Blackhat Badger is at Sunken Valley Cavern Idol
[4:17:24] <vVAstrAVv> oops all ichimonji
[4:17:29] <KingOfTheGeats> you progressed his storyline
[4:17:29] <Indigo_Automaton> You advanced his quest
[4:17:35] <TonberryLives> Ichi is good, it just has to be used appropriately LUL
[4:17:42] <+cubbywolf> he's just before the yeeting part of the gun fort
[4:17:44] <brunoberserk> woolie's getting angry
[4:17:46] <+cubbywolf> the spiderman part
[4:17:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I think the trigger is when you buy the fan from him. now he should be where the monks hang out
[4:18:02] <+cubbywolf> sunken valley
[4:18:04] <TheRealGreaterGamer> What are they trying to do?
[4:18:07] <thebalticguy1> Ichi is the best move in the game, but over relying is detrimenting Woolie's play
[4:18:13] <+cubbywolf> he should be just behind you
[4:18:20] <+thedreampie> why's he looking for the dood?
[4:18:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheRealGreaterGamer buy the anti air death blow
[4:18:24] <TonberryLives> Just go to the temple. It's probably in the box at this point
[4:18:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's another guy
[4:18:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Doesnt Badger just sell it from the get go?
[4:18:54] <starlessdan> He should be at Senpou temple along the great snake route by now
[4:18:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> senpou temple, the tree area with monks
[4:18:57] <+cubbywolf> woolie never meat the guy
[4:19:02] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus He is in the cave you can only reach by jumping onto a Kite, if you remember you had to ninjitsu muppet
[4:19:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh yeah hes in a super hard to reach area at this point in the game
[4:19:34] <TheRealGreaterGamer> But doesnt Badge only move there AFTER you buy all of his inventory?
[4:19:42] <+cubbywolf> does woolie have the umbrella?
[4:19:51] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Check the Senpou Temple list for that location
[4:19:54] <brunoberserk> Rare Footage of Woolie Actually Angry
[4:20:03] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the kite is on top of the gods y
[4:20:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> giant tree
[4:20:19] <lotharrio> It has been a minute since I played this.
[4:20:22] <+TangoNango> It's at the starting location of Senpou Temple where you'll find the kite.
[4:20:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Did they not find him near the saint grave? Or was he not there?
[4:20:38] <+cubbywolf> chat, if he's not at the grave marker at sunken valley
[4:20:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Hes in the house just beneath it
[4:20:48] <+cubbywolf> he's not anywhere
[4:20:53] <+cubbywolf> he'll be somewhere later
[4:21:15] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Go from the first chekpoint, the kite should be visible
[4:21:21] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He doesnt show up "Later" unless you've spoken to him
[4:21:39] <+cubbywolf> if woolie didnt speak to him in the start then the quest is botched
[4:21:59] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus If you progress thru the area until you enter and exit a building you will find your lady
[4:22:12] <+cubbywolf> wow thats right he was here
[4:22:13] <+TangoNango> Oh he's already got the kite up
[4:22:17] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Chat, was he REALLY not at the saint grave? Or did they just not go into his house? I was afk
[4:22:21] <thebalticguy1> The kite should already be in position
[4:22:33] <lotharrio> Ninja kites.
[4:22:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:22:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Im assuming they're just blind
[4:22:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheRealGreaterGamer wasn't there
[4:22:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Weird
[4:22:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they went in the house
[4:22:47] <TonberryLives> Dilapidated Temple offering box. I swear it's the most likely spot for the anti-air now. @WoolieVersus
[4:23:01] <armchairmaster_> The tiny guy will allow you to do the kite-thing
[4:23:04] <thebalticguy1> Woolie already did that step, he doesnt spawn
[4:23:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if the kite is already up, you need to go further ahead to use the kite to cross the chasm
[4:23:11] <+cubbywolf> you dont use blackhat to control it
[4:23:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you just need to swing from the kite
[4:23:19] <+cubbywolf> but blackhat tells you to look at that guy
[4:23:20] <Indigo_Automaton> That wasn't Blackhat Minh
[4:23:28] <thebalticguy1> Woolie did back when he murderied the snake
[4:23:33] <Indigo_Automaton> Go up to that Kite passage
[4:23:42] <+TangoNango> There is another idol closer
[4:23:56] <+cubbywolf> I saw a point in the wiki ahead, but woolie has to beat the next boss it looks like
[4:24:03] <thebalticguy1> THE RUST
[4:24:12] <TonberryLives> Well, they'll figure it out or give up LUL
[4:24:19] <+cubbywolf> past woolie sabatoging future woolie
[4:24:39] <Indigo_Automaton> Wrong merchant for the scroll
[4:24:48] <andre11dr> I stepped away to eat, what are we looking for?
[4:24:57] <%SainEdge> he definitely talked to blackhead after the kite, before the snake. I remember Woolie saying "this dude fucks" after he heard the guy had a kid LUL
[4:24:58] <+cubbywolf> blackhat the merchant
[4:25:05] <thebalticguy1> @andre11dr the merchant with anti air deathblow
[4:25:11] <Indigo_Automaton> Get to the Kite
[4:25:12] <andre11dr> Ok ok
[4:25:13] <+cubbywolf> does woolie have the umbrela?
[4:25:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its on the other end i think
[4:25:20] <+penjaza> Assuming you finished the quest try the merchant at the Home Temple
[4:25:21] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Look for the Big Tree
[4:25:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> just run
[4:25:39] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Jesus christ
[4:25:45] <Klefth> These guys are bosses
[4:25:46] <%jaggstar2020> Beyblade Ninjas
[4:25:57] <andre11dr> You can just rum past everyone
[4:25:58] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Its in this area
[4:26:02] <TonberryLives> Noice
[4:26:05] <thebalticguy1> Woolie big mad
[4:26:07] <+cubbywolf> did woolie search the sunken valley enough?
[4:26:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yeah the kite is in this area
[4:26:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> just run
[4:26:15] <ronin19xx> Hands down the coolest enemy
[4:26:15] <+cubbywolf> he really should be in the valley
[4:26:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Its complete opposite the cave exit on the other side
[4:26:20] <lotharrio> Took that guy a long minute to decide on fighting.
[4:26:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Its the giant tree
[4:27:01] <+cubbywolf> why would you need money?
[4:27:03] <TheRealGreaterGamer> NO HE DOESNT
[4:27:11] <Ashenik1> why money ?!
[4:27:11] <%SainEdge> what?
[4:27:14] <+cubbywolf> you can get back
[4:27:14] <+BlackSunEmperor> need a technique
[4:27:16] <syanplague> to buy the scroll
[4:27:23] <+cubbywolf> he wont be here
[4:27:24] <saraizarai> Looking at this, god I wish this was a souls game, and not a parry game
[4:27:28] <+cubbywolf> find him 100%
[4:27:32] <+cubbywolf> if he's there i'll sub

[4:34:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Of course he fucking had it, Badger doesn't go the cavern until you buy everything from him ffs. That's why I was so confused when he wasn't there.

[4:48:42] <andre11dr> Well didn't go according to plan
[4:48:47] <ronin19xx> Love those blitzball enemies
[4:48:55] <ronin19xx> So stylish
[4:49:02] <vVAstrAVv> the drive by is forever the strongest tech
[4:49:10] <stormhawk9891> "clean"
[4:49:19] <+cubbywolf> he hasnt even explored the left yet
[4:49:32] <ronin19xx> Pat and Woolz are tied on views almost
[4:49:33] <+cubbywolf> but the lightning guy is there
[4:49:50] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[4:50:01] <nailwind> lets pretend that landed
[4:50:04] <+cubbywolf> nice try but thats a big botch
[4:50:10] <ullyzeez> sick
[4:50:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> fighting 3 of them is  a bad idea
[4:50:19] <ronin19xx> Wombo combo!
[4:50:19] <+TheotherKristian> B.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.botch
[4:50:19] <andre11dr> He saw it ,but he just got killed
[4:50:21] <+cubbywolf> well if you blood smoke you can cheeze them
[4:50:21] <%Lion_kun> woolie, you're a ninja
[4:50:28] <TonberryLives> Let the salt flow through yooooouuu
[4:50:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> One stab from sabi poisons them AND stuns then
[4:50:32] <%Lion_kun> either run by or pick them off one by one
[4:50:35] <%SouLucha> Honestly this area is rough if he doesn't take it slowly.
[4:50:36] <Kohei_kyouji> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli i said before but its not 'super' bad. you can catch the lightning and hit all of them at once with it
[4:50:45] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Going under the floor is somewhat more managable until a point
[4:50:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:50:47] <andre11dr> Woolie getting that Souls ex
[4:50:47] <Mike_Squeeze> Is this Woolie's first playthrough?
[4:50:53] <+cubbywolf> yeah
[4:50:53] <%Afterman_> Hows the stream been
[4:51:03] <+cubbywolf> he had the other ending halfway through, he said on the podcast
[4:51:04] <Ashenik1> just defeat them 4Head
[4:51:06] <soul_overdrive> Woolie, remember the basics of stealth woolieSPICE
[4:51:13] <T_Sasquatch> like i said this game shits itself when theres more than one enemy in the encounter
[4:51:19] <%Afterman_> stealth is for babies
[4:51:21] <+cubbywolf> every souls does
[4:51:22] <andre11dr> Remember the basics of CQC
[4:51:31] <Kohei_kyouji> @T_Sasquatch especially this area due ot all the water

[4:52:28] <@Solidus_113> burgers and fries
[4:52:31] <+cubbywolf> the only way is through is with the sword
[4:52:32] <+RyTYoung> this is probably my favourite area in the game
[4:52:43] <Kohei_kyouji> same ^
[4:52:56] <Kohei_kyouji> i got a bit sick of ashina castle and hirata estate
[4:52:56] <vVAstrAVv> its everyones favorite area
[4:52:58] <+cubbywolf> oh man this part
[4:53:02] <%SouLucha> Well, guess Woolie will learn his way. Also chat pretending this was all easy... LUL
[4:53:04] <lotharrio> I eventually came to like this area a lot.
[4:53:05] <Kohei_kyouji> i dont like revists very much
[4:53:08] <andre11dr> To quote one Dark Kahn ,YOU MUUUUST FIIGHHHT
[4:53:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> PUPPETMASTER
[4:53:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's like a painting damn near
[4:53:14] <+cubbywolf> Ashina castle is way more fun the 1st time imo
[4:53:17] <+cubbywolf> but thats me
[4:53:30] <nailwind> look at em vibing
[4:53:32] <Kohei_kyouji> @SouLucha not 'easy' but its not as hard as theyre making it look
[4:53:40] <lotharrio> Puppeteer jutsu can earn you some time.
[4:53:49] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Remember you have the bloodsmoke or puppet
[4:53:50] <+cubbywolf> blood smoke cheeze is how i did it
[4:53:51] <%Lion_kun> sneak around
[4:53:57] <+TheotherKristian> stab and bad
[4:54:00] <+cubbywolf> took lots of times
[4:54:01] <%hax_metatron> Use blood smoke and chain them all
[4:54:03] <+TheotherKristian> stab and dab
[4:54:09] <andre11dr> You can sneak on them
[4:54:10] <%SouLucha> @Kohei_kyouji Yeah Woolz is rushing it a bit much but I see chat inflating their egos a bit much.
[4:54:25] <Kohei_kyouji> @cubbywolf catch lightning and kill them all at once with it >_<
[4:54:39] <+cubbywolf> ride the lightning? but that could kill me
[4:54:47] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[4:55:14] <Kohei_kyouji> yes
[4:55:19] <Johannen> Gachiin's Sugar will help with stealth

[4:55:27] <+cubbywolf> crouch waaaalk
[4:55:47] <+Gallhint> Puppeteer is so fucking rad

[4:56:28] <+Gallhint> walk of shame
[4:56:30] <andre11dr> All according to Kechaku
[4:56:43] <+cubbywolf> pupper fish
[4:56:46] <saraizarai> Parry that dog
[4:56:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> but there are fewer of them now, you can puppet another
[4:57:05] <+cubbywolf> snipe this man!
[4:57:05] <MacDatAss> lightning reversal is so cool
[4:57:07] <lotharrio> I think the sniper is right here.
[4:57:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice

[4:58:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:58:15] <vVAstrAVv> i feel like avatar inspired that lightening mechanic
[4:58:19] <+cubbywolf> the magic death
[4:58:20] <andre11dr> That's NOT a headless
[4:58:23] <MacDatAss> headless suck
[4:58:23] <+DJ_Omen> there isn't a way to return if you fall off
[4:58:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> WORSE
[4:58:37] <Johannen> Realy? I find SHichimen way easier then Headless
[4:58:52] <vVAstrAVv> cus they are easier
[4:58:54] <lotharrio> Shichimen can be anti-aerial DB'd right?
[4:59:01] <Johannen> Yep
[4:59:02] <+SouLucha> Yeah.
[4:59:05] <MacDatAss> that wasnt a headless but there is a headless in this area
[4:59:06] <andre11dr> At least you can just kill them, unlike the headless
[4:59:10] <+bapposbungers> I just got here and I'm greeted with Minh! Welcome back brother! <3
[4:59:19] <+DJ_Omen> there is methods to instant kill shicimens
[4:59:19] <nailwind> the headless are deeply unsettling
[4:59:20] <Johannen> But i think you can only Air Deathblow them if you use Divine COnfeti
[4:59:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Puppet another
[4:59:53] <nailwind> woolie's eyes have gone full predator, hunting his prey

[5:07:41] <MacDatAss> air is infinite
[5:07:45] <Indigo_Automaton> You can breathe forever
[5:07:45] <lotharrio> Diving required a breath holding technique.
[5:07:46] <munitalprats> you learned a super breathing technique when you beat that original monk
[5:07:56] <nailwind> shinobi breathing techniques
[5:08:04] <starlessdan> mibu breathing technique
[5:08:09] <munitalprats> YEAH
[5:08:10] <BerryliciousDefinition> @caninedog1998 Woolie was playing the first few hours of Yakuza 7, yeah
[5:08:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> what do you mean "good ones"
[5:08:12] <%hax_metatron> You learned that technique of somehow being able to breathe
[5:08:14] <munitalprats> this is why this is my favorite zone fromsoft ever made
[5:08:16] <MacDatAss> monkaS
[5:08:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> It's like Demon Slayer, where the key to being a badass is just fucking breathing gooder

[5:08:35] <munitalprats> i cant believe fromsoft got swimming right the first try

[5:09:28] <Kohei_kyouji> ^
[5:09:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ye
[5:09:29] <munitalprats> you dont need confetti
[5:09:35] <munitalprats> probably cause of the holy water or whatever
[5:09:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> easier bc you don't need confetti
[5:09:38] <%SouLucha> Not this one...
[5:09:43] <The_Nerd_Supreme> aw yeah!! I been waiting for this!! *3rd strike announcer voice*
[5:09:46] <MacDatAss> the water headless are easier cause they take more damage
[5:09:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because your dodge here is massive
[5:09:50] <%RaziWraith> I wouldn't say easier, just more straightforward.
[5:09:58] <+Gallhint> You can't confetti underwater, they're extra rotted and extra vulnerable
[5:09:58] <munitalprats> the rewards are all good
[5:09:59] <lotharrio> It still helps, just not needed.
[5:10:07] <%jinking79> Infinite Candy

[5:10:15] <OblivionSword1> the rewards are infinite candy
[5:10:15] <%LastHazzerd> they don't have the physical resistance that land headless do

[5:12:42] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieMINHMAX woolieFUN
[5:12:42] <vVAstrAVv> farm it to get better of course
[5:12:47] <andre11dr> Yeah, that was 2 bosses and most of this zone, it's a good stream
[5:12:48] <@Solidus_113> you beat 2 bosses
[5:12:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GREAT
[5:12:49] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieYE woolieFUN
[5:12:54] <syanplague> it was great
[5:12:54] <%LastHazzerd> LUL yeah, tho like everything in this game, once ya get their rythm they're more manageable.
[5:12:55] <%Lion_kun> I enjyoed it a lot, did you enjoy it woolie?
[5:12:55] <Kohei_kyouji> progressssss
[5:12:56] <vVAstrAVv> those guys are so fun to fight
[5:12:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> how does it make u feel Woolie
[5:12:57] <brunoberserk> OOOOFFF
[5:12:59] <OblivionSword1> pretty good progress
[5:13:00] <%SouLucha> LUL
[5:13:01] <lotharrio> What were the bosses he fought?
[5:13:03] <Afrosamasenpai> big good session
[5:13:06] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie sweatin'
[5:13:09] <@Solidus_113> Owl and Monk
[5:13:13] <andre11dr> Also all the mumbling around for nothing was pretty funny LUL
[5:13:17] <lotharrio> Those are both tricky.
[5:13:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> wait he fought Owl?
[5:13:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Which Owl?
[5:13:23] <caninedog1998> you're feelings don't matter!! cmonBruh
[5:13:23] <vVAstrAVv> habits aside woolie did good for being so rusty
[5:13:25] <%ChoculaUltra> First Owl
[5:13:26] <Kohei_kyouji> @lotharrio owl and the monk i think
[5:13:27] <%ChoculaUltra> not Father Owl
[5:13:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ok ok
[5:13:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the easy one
[5:13:35] <%LastHazzerd> oh yeah, that's why Minh was suggesting the bad end first
[5:13:35] <wruce__billis> what rofftop moment
[5:13:37] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah that one
[5:13:39] <JetpackMcQuack> Its crazy
[5:13:41] <wruce__billis> genichiro?
[5:13:41] <%Lion_kun> nah 2 sessions to do everything
[5:13:42] <Indigo_Automaton> There's still more after the palace too
[5:13:51] <OblivionSword1> @wruce__billis owl
[5:13:54] <JetpackMcQuack> The best parts of the game
[5:13:55] <munitalprats> 2 sessions to do everything
[5:13:57] <%LastHazzerd> but yeah, i'm glad the break did ya good
[5:13:59] <munitalprats> or 1 session and you beat the game
[5:14:01] <MeMillionthDollar> SO GLAD you came back Woolie
[5:14:05] <andre11dr> 2 sessions and he'll be done
[5:14:06] <+DJ_Omen> glad you came back to sekiro @woolieversus finish the fight
[5:14:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[5:14:09] <Kohei_kyouji> @Indigo_Automaton 2 or 3 zones? depending on if he does optional stuff, right?
[5:14:13] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[5:14:33] <munitalprats> yeah its not like there is online
[5:14:34] <%zanzibar_junker> Bad ending sucks
[5:14:39] <+penjaza> I'm with Woolie on this one.  Do Bad ending later
[5:14:46] <%LastHazzerd> this is just for story, not mechanics, the reward for bad end doesn't matter
[5:14:48] <munitalprats> its emma into isshin
[5:14:49] <%ChoculaUltra> I liked the bad ending!
[5:14:50] <munitalprats> old man
[5:14:53] <Indigo_Automaton> @Kohei_kyouji Sorta
[5:15:00] <vVAstrAVv> bad end doesn't have DRAGON
[5:15:01] <%ChoculaUltra> well the fights rather
[5:15:02] <Johannen> Phase 2 of Monk was great, aggresion was on point with deflecting
[5:15:04] <@Solidus_113> It's gonna be jank going from this character with more moves back to the old bad end one
[5:15:04] <+Gallhint> Bad ending first makes good ending feel better tho but all things are fine
[5:15:13] <andre11dr> Do you get anything for the endings,
[5:15:15] <munitalprats> Woolie was doing super good against the corrupted monk
[5:15:19] <brunoberserk> is not genichiro
[5:15:24] <munitalprats> felt like the rhythm was clicking
[5:15:27] <syanplague> i mean Woolie if i can say something you coming back in this game is also giving me courage to finish it, i only needed to finish two bosses but it was really stressing me, so looking you play is motivating
[5:15:30] <Johannen> Yeye
[5:15:40] <Kohei_kyouji> @andre11dr a different skill depending on which final boss you go after
[5:15:48] <+nabs2099> @woolieversus Dude I would honestly say forget the bad ending. just do the true end like you're doing
[5:16:00] <JetpackMcQuack> Right back into a brick wall haha
[5:16:17] <starlessdan> it's easier and faster to fight those bosses in NG+1, NG+1 takes about 2 hours
[5:16:28] <%0rond> once you beat the game skipping all the optional stuff you can speedrun it to the bad ending in like 2 hours
[5:16:28] <soul_overdrive> Do what is feels right to you Woolie, going like you don't know nothing about what is coming next is the best experience
[5:16:46] <Pyrrhus90> its meh LUL
[5:16:49] <Indigo_Automaton> We're just glad you're returning to it! :D
[5:16:52] <munitalprats> i mean too be fair
[5:16:52] <brunoberserk> so you like lightining reversal , huh ? Kappa
[5:16:55] <Afrosamasenpai> But Kuro!
[5:16:57] <munitalprats> Fromsoft games dont really have stories anyway
[5:16:58] <andre11dr> It is very meh
[5:16:59] <wruce__billis> It's kinda cool that you
[5:16:59] <+Gallhint> The story is cool tho...
[5:17:02] <+krispen_wa> Fromsoft story LUL
[5:17:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I like the world lore
[5:17:05] <+RJay80> story? hggWho
[5:17:06] <+nabs2099> looool I actually like the story but I actually get this.
[5:17:06] <munitalprats> I think this game put more effort than say, darksouls
[5:17:08] <Magicferret> This and Nioh's story is harder to follow
[5:17:08] <Johannen> I love the characters and thier Sake stories
[5:17:09] <wruce__billis> 're enemies are the Tokugawa shogunate tbh
[5:17:11] <soul_overdrive> And Sekiro gives that kind of experince so is all good
[5:17:11] <lotharrio> The setting is pretty cool.
[5:17:12] <%Lion_kun> you have to do a bunch of bullshit to get the secret boss
[5:17:14] <JetpackMcQuack> Immortality bad
[5:17:14] <+nabs2099> Not nearly as compelling as Soulsborne
[5:17:16] <OblivionSword1> it's FromSoft what story ?
[5:17:20] <vVAstrAVv> you dont like your incense fetch quest?
[5:17:23] <%LastHazzerd> this is FromSoft's attempt at story, but their fanbase don't give a fuck
[5:17:24] <Kohei_kyouji> I like the story but I actually know what it is, so~
[5:17:28] <%SouLucha> Nioh is that for me, Idc about it
[5:17:36] <TonberryLives> It's better than people make it out to be but I've long since given up arguing my point.
[5:17:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Catch the vaati vids
[5:17:42] <+invida> I like the story, but it's completely understandable if you don't
[5:17:44] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[5:17:44] <soul_overdrive> ye ye ye totally agree with Woolz woolieSPICE
[5:17:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I like the fact that this world is a world where everyone is so obsessed with immortality that everyone made their own fucked up versions of immortality like the Dragon boys or the Mibu village zombies or the centipede monks.
[5:17:49] <andre11dr> When Fromsoft is not obscure, they're story telling is not very good
[5:17:52] <+RJay80> woolie is firmly in the Beaten Into Silence Tier
[5:17:58] <vVAstrAVv> niohs story is just history caked in anime
[5:18:00] <therealtacopancakes> sekiro boss rush would be dope
[5:18:04] <+krispen_wa> Is there any Soulslike with a good story?
[5:18:09] <munitalprats> @krispen_wa no
[5:18:12] <CoffeeSlice> sad
[5:18:19] <munitalprats> the other soulslikes dont *have* stories.
[5:18:23] <+nabs2099> All the From games have great stories.
[5:18:26] <%LastHazzerd> @therealtacopancakes that's what the last update added
[5:18:27] <Kohei_kyouji> Demons souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro. Those stories are decent
[5:18:31] <+nabs2099> Idk about Soulslikes
[5:18:35] <soul_overdrive> what it matters is the rad battles you are facing along the way
[5:18:36] <Ashenik1> @krispen_wa  dark souls 1 character stories are fun
[5:18:37] <lotharrio> I wouldn't really call Sekiro a soulslike?
[5:18:44] <munitalprats> there's more like, character stories.
[5:18:48] <+nabs2099> DS2 has one of the strongest stories but okay
[5:18:49] <Kohei_kyouji> @Ashenik1 i agree with that.
[5:18:55] <munitalprats> theres no "tale" or "quest story"
[5:18:57] <+krispen_wa> ds2 has Aldia and thats it
[5:18:57] <saraizarai> DS2 imo has the best story
[5:19:02] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Hey Woolz, happy to see you're back into the game.  Hopefully the swordplay is meshing with you more this time around, because if it is then you have probably some of From's best fights coming up.
[5:19:08] <wruce__billis> DS2 has the best story
[5:19:11] <+Gallhint> Goddamn dude Elden Ring better have a more solid story foundation
[5:19:11] <artoflec> yeah i didnt give a shit about any of the stories or stuff past dark souls 1 besides bloodborne a bit
[5:19:12] <munitalprats> DS2 probably had a bigger attempt at making a story than the others
[5:19:18] <Kohei_kyouji> I like the DS2 DLC stories but the main game story is kinda crap
[5:19:25] <+nabs2099> @saraizarai I think DS1 has the best but DS2 is easily better than DS3, especially w story.
[5:19:28] <andre11dr> DS2 has trash main caracter stories but cool main story
[5:19:29] <%LastHazzerd> FromSoft game
[5:19:34] <starlessdan> the story in Sekiro kinda only matters in the final boss fight
[5:19:40] <Indigo_Automaton> Sekiro has great characters but a meh story
[5:19:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:19:42] <Johannen> What was even the story of DS2?
[5:19:54] <@Solidus_113> hollowing
[5:19:57] <%ironohki> ironohki subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Sup Woolie? Hope you parry some bitches.
[5:19:57] <Kohei_kyouji> @Johannen 'I forgot'. Thats the story :P
[5:20:02] <syanplague> the difference is because they tell you the story insted of being suble
[5:20:02] <+krispen_wa> DS3's story is basically "Heres DS1 reference, also let this franchise die please"
[5:20:04] <+Gallhint> @Johannen the chosen undeads grand quest to find the comfiest IKEA chair
[5:20:09] <andre11dr> @johannen A bunch of convoluted shit
[5:20:21] <munitalprats> Yeah DS3's story is a bunch of DS1 references and slapping you across the face with them
[5:20:27] <+nabs2099> DS3 was just a DS1 remake
[5:20:57] <brunoberserk> story is okay , is a generic ninja/samurai story , but again i dont think they trying to be more than this
[5:21:03] <Kohei_kyouji> @munitalprats the stuff with Pontiff and Aldrich etc was decent and i liked Lothric and Lorian. But most of the other stuff i didnt really care for. I wish they leaned into it more
[5:21:11] <andre11dr> Iea i like DS3 a lot, but not for the story, i don't care much about the story in DS3
[5:21:24] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:21:27] <+krispen_wa> Nioh 2 at least has the Tokichiro stuff but its still really bad at telling you the story of the Sengoku Era
[5:21:28] <+RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[5:21:29] <Ashenik1> LUL
[5:21:30] <@Solidus_113> It's always Sunhi
[5:21:33] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[5:21:33] <Afrosamasenpai> that damn man and his slow mo
[5:21:33] <Indigo_Automaton> HAHAH
[5:21:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[5:21:53] <MeMillionthDollar> The gauntlets
[5:21:59] <%Lion_kun> of the three samurai games, nioh, sekiro and tsushima, sekiro by far has the best combat.
[5:22:13] <MeMillionthDollar> Sekiro is TOO SICK
[5:22:15] <+nabs2099> Eh they're all different.
[5:22:15] <%SouLucha> woolieYE
[5:22:15] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[5:22:27] <saraizarai> I like souls combat more than I like sekiro's
[5:22:28] <Johannen> Woolie is a giant hipster for cool visual shit)
[5:22:36] <%Lion_kun> nioh 2 has the best levelling and tsushima ahs the best exploration
[5:22:45] <@Solidus_113> That NieR Automata story is ending soon
[5:22:57] <munitalprats> yes
[5:22:57] <%zanzibar_junker> Nioh 2 has best combat
[5:23:01] <munitalprats> the big golden spark
[5:23:04] <munitalprats> and the big clang audio
[5:23:08] <+krispen_wa> Nioh 2 has best everything except graphics
[5:23:15] <+krispen_wa> Nioh 2 looks like ass
[5:23:15] <Indigo_Automaton> Sharp noises are good, chunky noises are bad
[5:23:40] <andre11dr> I will say, Nioh 2 level design is not that great
[5:23:44] <OblivionSword1> hopefully the delay can fix the lobby
[5:23:52] <+krispen_wa> oh yeah level design too is bad
[5:23:54] <andre11dr> Definitely not as good as From level design
[5:23:57] <syanplague> they probally going to give another beta with Anji and I-no
[5:23:57] <Kohei_kyouji> i'll go back to Nioh 2 someday...
[5:24:03] <%Lion_kun> nioh's combat is jjust make a busted build and spam high stance attacks lol
[5:24:05] <Psyramics> they called out the feedback for lobbies in the announcement
[5:24:06] <%jinking79> god please that damn lobby
[5:24:09] <Kohei_kyouji> i mostly just like ma-demon girls
[5:24:22] <+Gallhint> Negative nancy? Or Realistic Rhonda
[5:24:25] <passserby> wonder how much of the feedback mentioned crossplay
[5:24:27] <+MikeNmurdoc> Yea arc sys addressed the lobbies when they announced the delay thank god
[5:24:33] <Zayasu> they will patch in delay based netcode thanks to justin
[5:24:33] <%ChoculaUltra> "we heard the feedback for the lobby - we have added new weapons wing animations for the lobby avatars - thank you for waiting." - Arksys, probably.
[5:24:51] <@Solidus_113> Lobby functionality, not actual changes to the system
[5:24:52] <+yukichocomilk> they're switching to blitz netcode Kappa
[5:24:57] <+RJay80> We heard youre feedback and decided to DOUBLE DOWN. The lobbies now have a life sim mechanic.
[5:24:58] <+cubbywolf> imagine if they delayed just to add rematch
[5:25:02] <%jinking79> put a damn rematch button
[5:25:02] <+nabs2099> When will ArcSys make a JoJo game
[5:25:07] <munitalprats> Woolie that argument is dumb
[5:25:09] <%megaman_sentinel> rematch would be big
[5:25:09] <jorniev> how about fix anji mitos lack of shirt
[5:25:13] <munitalprats> If your excuse for the lobby is that you dont have to use them
[5:25:16] <munitalprats> that means the lobby is shit
[5:25:21] <@Solidus_113> I'd call that a failed lobby
[5:25:21] <+DJ_Omen> FYI Strive will now release the day after ff7r intergrade.... Max is pissed! doodCrazy
[5:25:27] <andre11dr> @nabs2099 Thats what I've been asking
[5:25:39] <@Solidus_113> @DJ_Omen and the same day as Ratchet and Clank
[5:25:54] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean unless Max is doing a full replay of the game, I don't think the Yuffie episode is going to be THAT long.
[5:25:55] <+cubbywolf> its just ffr again but with dlc. its not a big deal
[5:25:56] <+nabs2099> @andre11dr If enough of us make noise it still won't happen but at least we'll have a community
[5:25:57] <andre11dr> Just give Jojo and One Piece to Arcsis and where done
[5:25:58] <+MikeNmurdoc> Nioh play LUL
[5:26:02] <%ekodrop> so basically nioh
[5:26:06] <$arcielardor> nioh
[5:26:08] <munitalprats> i mean look
[5:26:09] <The_Nerd_Supreme> Coldplay?
[5:26:11] <vVAstrAVv> i too wish sekiro was nioh
[5:26:13] <munitalprats> Sekiro wasnt even trying to be a Soulsgame realy
[5:26:20] <starlessdan> Will you stream Nioh 2?
[5:26:23] <+nabs2099> Nioh 2 is better except when it's not.
[5:26:33] <+cubbywolf> sekiro is an action game made by dark souls people
[5:26:39] <vVAstrAVv> its never not better sooo
[5:26:47] <+nabs2099> Sekiro really should have had RPG elements and more weapons.
[5:26:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[5:29:20] <+nabs2099> @caninedog1998 I genuinely feel bad for them dude.
[5:29:48] <andre11dr> Copyright makes no sense, it really seems to just be random bullshit
