[1:03:57] <derap41> @thetrashman_sc what was the original mission?
[1:04:04] <hntronium> recon
[1:04:04] <+MoralCompassGaming> It's also an Army of Two thing
[1:04:14] <thetrashman_sc> PogChamp
[1:04:16] <+MoralCompassGaming> Not just Gears
[1:04:28] <dukenux> I remember the marketing for this game, and how BIG part of the gameplay sand physics were supposed to be...
[1:04:32] <+jiggy_snipe> @derap41 recon
[1:04:34] <JayEarly> there’s a dying but not dead mechanic for your enemies
[1:04:36] <thetrashman_sc> the mission was to find out of people were still alive in the city
[1:04:38] <derap41> @MoralCompassGaming Man Army of Two was so good same it lost all steam
[1:04:39] <thetrashman_sc> and then get out
[1:04:39] <+paladinstarbuster> that would hurt like shit
[1:04:45] <alpacapologist> call your danny glover killstreak in
[1:04:46] <dukenux> ... and it's only few locations where you can shoot stuff to bury enemies in sand
[1:04:48] <JayEarly> so you can execute them
[1:04:55] <+professormorrigan> Mission: Find survivors
[1:04:58] <@Squdnate> Walker has some BIG guns in order to do that, if you know what I mean
[1:05:03] <+professormorrigan> New Mission: Execute All Survivors

[1:34:02] <+RealThiele> it seems that woolie hasnt played it but has been ok previously reading about the game
[1:34:07] <derap41> UMP-45 is such a strange weapon its meant to be a next generation PDW but the point of the PDW was to have a fast moving light bullet that could penetrate armor
[1:34:10] <RunningNGunning> An hour
[1:34:18] <+jiggy_snipe> @CursedNobleman Chapter 4 I think
[1:34:43] <CursedNobleman> @jiggy_snipe thanks sir! thats good enough for me to figure out when the fun happens

[1:36:32] <thetrashman_sc> SourPls
[1:36:34] <ELJOVENBATALI> man gun to your head has gotten intense lately
[1:36:45] <BearSawed> Ill try flanking, thats a good trick
[1:36:48] <+Mkingston> @derap41 The Naughty List is the worst
[1:36:50] <derap41> ugh he was so close to greatness
[1:36:51] <Solidnick18> try the ump
[1:36:53] <Solidnick18> ye
[1:37:00] <CursedNobleman> is the gameplay in this good? decent?
[1:37:03] <ShlickityShlim> Sounds like the ost for a skateboarding game
[1:37:05] <+Toblo1> Its decent
[1:37:07] <derap41> Skipped the grenade launcher twice
[1:37:10] <+Toblo1> If sometimes jank
[1:37:10] <hntronium> gameplay is okay
[1:37:16] <+RealThiele> paintballs make minh sweaty
[1:37:22] <HorribleHog> I like what spec ops tries to do, I hate that it still falls into so many video game tropes on controls and how weapons work
[1:37:23] <ELJOVENBATALI> @cursednobleman nothing to write home about, the writing carries the game
[1:37:24] <RunningNGunning> @CursedNobleman for a third person shooter from the time its decent
[1:37:27] <buffmurffy> gameplay is serviceable, its not the draw
[1:37:41] <derap41> @HorribleHog its works in the games favor if you
[1:37:41] <+Nomicro4u> STUN GRENADE FOUND
[1:37:49] <+RealThiele> big helps
[1:37:50] <derap41> 're not aware of what they game is trying to do
[1:37:55] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Nomicro4u
[1:37:55] <thetrashman_sc> its got some okay ideas in gameplay
[1:38:00] <CursedNobleman> is the writing good up until the FUN? or is it just about acclimation?
[1:38:05] <+Nomicro4u> QUICK shoot them WHILE they're STUNNED!
[1:38:06] <+jiggy_snipe> yes Woolie keep shooting Lugo
[1:38:07] <thetrashman_sc> but its not much to write home about
[1:38:18] <+Ryu_R> shooting them in the neck LUL
[1:38:20] <BearSawed> Alot of environmental destruction in this
[1:38:21] <+Mkingston> It looks like what it is. A PS3/360 cover shooter
[1:38:26] <thetrashman_sc> the multiplayer actually had a really neat gameplay idea
[1:38:33] <thetrashman_sc> rocks has dummy grenades
[1:38:35] <Toaster_Noodle> Paintball and airsoft are both pretty good
[1:38:40] <thetrashman_sc> to flush people out
[1:38:50] <Toaster_Noodle> Both have different draws to them
[1:38:52] <CursedNobleman> @thetrashman_sc thats cool
[1:38:52] <primaryfire> laser tag isn't fun because you can cheat huh sajamStare
[1:38:56] <derap41> Yeah NoS paintball is the shit
[1:39:06] <thetrashman_sc> the mp is trash tho
[1:39:13] <CursedNobleman> @primaryfire no cheating, or you have a team armed with high pwoered lasers LUL
[1:39:21] <CursedNobleman> have to face*
[1:39:22] <derap41> Red On Screen So Real
[1:39:22] <+Mkingston> I went paintballing once. Did not expect the guns to be so heavy. My arms hurt the next day.
[1:39:28] <+RealThiele> getting shot in the mask in paintball sucks, the paint tastes like garbo
[1:39:29] <BearSawed> Wipe the jelly off your eyes
[1:39:34] <zamzoph> You saying I can't dodge bullets?
[1:39:40] <+Nomicro4u> just get anti fog goggles and you're fine
[1:39:48] <BearSawed> Well its not paint, its mostly fish oil

[1:39:56] <rumuloh> Millsim airsoft is fun, if you aren't turned off by larping and tryhards
[1:39:56] <DaBigVitus> god this is the worst damage indicator trend in gaming
[1:40:00] <+Kenshi_Kelevra> Got misted
[1:40:06] <%gatorafan> All of them are blind
[1:40:08] <+Nomicro4u> Go shooting its awesome

[1:40:24] <ELJOVENBATALI> shooting is neato
[1:40:25] <BearSawed> Skeet is so fun
[1:40:26] <+thatfig> this is my favorite gears clone
[1:40:31] <rumuloh> @hntronium Oh I know
[1:40:36] <+Javaa01> There's stairs ahead of you
[1:40:48] <+Mkingston> I'm not interested in shooting real guns either. As a Brit I'm anti-gun.
[1:40:54] <derap41> Shooting beer cans in the woods is still most fun
[1:40:56] <ELJOVENBATALI> this game is just eyepatchwolf trying to get woolie to watch hunter x hunter
[1:41:00] <+Nomicro4u> airsoft is worse
[1:41:02] <hntronium> REGGIE THE MASOCHIST

[1:41:11] <BallerSwagBro9k> BDSM REGGIE
[1:41:11] <HorribleHog> derap41 I see what you mean, but I'd like more punishment, and more depiction of the horror
[1:41:12] <BearSawed> plastic pellets
[1:41:15] <flexxarnnn> airsoft depents entirely on what your wearing
[1:41:16] <+Nomicro4u> they're small they sting and they stick in your skin if you're not wearing layers
[1:41:23] <mankeyfigh> Oh bye the way guys, they don’t really read chat while playing
[1:41:31] <+RealThiele> but you do
[1:41:32] <primaryfire> airsoft needs to hurt more since you won't be splattered with paint if you get shot
[1:41:37] <%jepupu> Most know that
[1:41:43] <TigerClaws12> airsoft LARPers have so much gear on now, the pellets barely do anything LUL
[1:41:45] <HorribleHog> derap41 -- In every fight
[1:41:49] <oyyzzo> only reggie checks chat
[1:41:51] <%jepupu> I'd imagine anyway
[1:42:00] <+ArcanumMBD> oh no guys they don't read chat, time for everyone to stop talking to each other in chat
[1:42:12] <+Mkingston> Throwing Frank
[1:42:16] <warmnoid> oh shit spec ops
[1:42:18] <%gatorafan> @mankeyfigh, On Death Stranding they do, they just don't acknowledge it. And Reggie is in chat check duty.
[1:42:28] <rumuloh> Nude airsoft with the boys, No ball shots! B)
[1:42:31] <+RealThiele> This message is colored differently. Thank you. that is all
[1:42:33] <thetrashman_sc> you just conked that guy in the head LUL
[1:42:36] <CursedNobleman> @rumuloh suuuure LUL
[1:42:42] <derap41> @HorribleHog idk realistic mechanics would kinda work against the unreal nature of the game
[1:42:49] <floralkami> lol, the head bonk with tht e nade
[1:42:50] <+ArcanumMBD> @realthiele true mvp msg right there

[1:43:14] <+Mkingston> F for Linus
[1:43:24] <thetrashman_sc> Shoot all the soldiers
[1:43:26] <+thatfig> the gore in this game has always been unsettling
[1:43:26] <+johnny_gogo> the lean forward for power
[1:43:34] <mankeyfigh> @gatorfan Oh that’s cool, I’ve never watched the Death Stranding LP
[1:43:38] <+MrRabbles> does the game have damage direction indicators?
[1:43:42] <BearSawed> shotty is not great in this
[1:43:51] <dukenux> woolie cant see red PepeHands
[1:43:51] <derap41> @Mkingston He's on to bigger things and its not farewell its more like be seeing you
[1:43:52] <CursedNobleman> i wonder how realistic the gore is then @thatfig
[1:44:05] <+MrRabbles> nvm it does
[1:44:11] <DaBigVitus> Stooges vibes from this song
[1:44:28] <+RealThiele> yakity sax starts up
[1:44:37] <G_Lancaster> @thatfig i think cod world at war trumps it though
[1:44:40] <+Mkingston> @derap41 basically family comes first. gotta respect that.
[1:44:57] <BearSawed> wiff
[1:45:15] <derap41> @Mkingston If there's any good reason to retire that would be among the top ones
[1:45:23] <+Toblo1> Shotgun requires some fernagling, but when you hit, you *HIT* in this game
[1:45:48] <+RealThiele> slug rounds mebbe
[1:45:50] <atgithursdays> song is by Black Angels
[1:45:54] <+thatfig> i think this game could have really fell apart if they didn’t nail that visceral feel
[1:46:00] <+nekodelic> song too loud compared to your voices
[1:46:11] <CrabSlacks> beating this game on the hardest difficulty was such a pain in the ass
[1:46:13] <HorribleHog> derap41 I'd love a mode where your character could get brutalized in a single hit, a contrast to the chest high wall mechanic
[1:46:34] <+RealThiele> this song reminds me of the music that accompanies vietnam war footage
[1:46:56] <thetrashman_sc> the soundtrack in this game is excellent
[1:46:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:47:05] <atgithursdays> @realthiele that's the entire bands discography imo
[1:47:06] <derap41> @HorribleHog I mean you're get to prefer what you prefer I still think it would weaken the thesis of the game
[1:47:10] <rumuloh> @RealThiele Weird that. Like it would go with apocalypse now or something
[1:47:10] <+Toblo1> WOOLIE

[1:52:14] <derap41> Man this music is Panic Inducing
[1:52:21] <HorribleHog> derap41 Which is why i argued that harder difficulty would enhance the thesis in the first place, but of course i respect your opinion that it should remain as it is
[1:52:30] <floralkami> Woolie, the glass
[1:52:32] <CrabSlacks> running from the mission objective is the right answer

[1:54:13] <T_Sasquatch> HOLY SHIT IS THIS THE NEW LP ?L
[1:54:15] <floralkami> it's not as accurate when crouched. also, the gun overheated
[1:54:17] <CrabSlacks> use the big gun with infinite ammo to shoot people, many bullets will also hit the glass
[1:54:18] <mankeyfigh> This is a really long section
[1:54:32] <+Nomicro4u> WHAT THE HELL WALKER
[1:54:34] <derap41> @HorribleHog The Thesis in my opinion is the juxtaposition of how expectations from game mechanics or rather the pre understood learned mechanics from the culture of war shooters leads the player to act without criticalu thinking
[1:54:40] <Pappajimbo> short controlled bursts
[1:54:49] <derap41> about their actions witnin the context of the game
[1:54:54] <+MrRabbles> this is a clusterfuck

[2:28:46] <Louie_Salmon> @cursednobleman Getting gud is a good trick
[2:28:47] <G_Lancaster> @CursedNobleman being able to aim works pretty well
[2:28:47] <@Solidus_113> What a shame
[2:28:47] <SilentPredator03> seems like woolz needs to up the sensitivity on his aim. he's too slow to react when people run up on him
[2:28:48] <Ganfur> walker needs a vanquish suit
[2:28:59] <+PapermanXD> NS
[2:29:05] <Prevot> weird to think that every enemy you kill is getting cucked
[2:29:07] <CursedNobleman> @Louie_Salmon @G_Lancaster lets not get crazy now LUL
[2:29:14] <BallinArbiter> You need to time your rolls. Go for a ravioli step

[2:29:41] <+nekodelic> @prevot mercy kill
[2:29:51] <konami2010> RIP
[2:29:51] <BallinArbiter> Walker needs viper’s titan
[2:29:55] <Ser_Randal> you really need to up the sensitivity
[2:29:55] <jorniev> yes
[2:29:55] <+Nomicro4u> Use shotgun
[2:29:57] <+Nomicro4u> why not
[2:29:58] <CrabSlacks> blind and hip fire can help
[2:29:59] <+Javaa01> Roll cancel the warcrime to keep the combo going
[2:30:02] <CursedNobleman> walked needs VATS
[2:30:05] <G_Lancaster> at least we know woolie wont miss those good ass loading tips later on
[2:30:19] <SilentPredator03> @G_Lancaster lol
[2:30:25] <derap41> Gotta snap aim more move your hip fire reticle then aim
[2:30:26] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:30:27] <konami2010> you have to escape the pit like Bane
[2:30:28] <BallinArbiter> @g_lancaster roasted
[2:30:29] <@Solidus_113> grenades and shotgun still around
[2:30:33] <+RealThiele> grenade civilians while you are stuck killing difficult enemies to keep the warcrime combo up
[2:30:39] <jorniev> sanp aim is the term of this stream
[2:30:45] <+Toblo1> If you can get ammo for it with Executions the Desert Eagle is good to keep
[2:31:01] <konami2010> on the highest difficulty this game is so damn hard
[2:31:03] <Ganfur> "do you feel like a hero yet?" no i feel like a pleb
[2:31:04] <TurtleButter> oh me oh my, Woolie playing the good shit
[2:31:05] <TheHeroAppears> can we vote to make minh plag
[2:31:06] <CrabSlacks> it's a wonder that his partners would be able to get down there at all considering how far he fell
[2:31:11] <TheHeroAppears> play'
[2:31:23] <mrblack499> that aim sensitivity looks unplayable
[2:31:26] <jorniev> melee is a legit strategy in this game
[2:31:38] <+Nomicro4u> HERO
[2:31:49] <+Toblo1> Shotgun also works wonders here since everyones trying to flank/advance you
[2:31:51] <jorniev> YOU DO
[2:31:58] <CursedNobleman> @mrblack499 how is he going to get to SSStylish with low sensitivity?
[2:32:08] <CrabSlacks> if I remember the executions get more extreme as the game continues

[2:42:28] <+RealThiele> Ultra Easy unlock incoming
[2:42:36] <dukenux> No Russian is a shock moment in an otherwise standard CoD game.
[2:42:38] <star_feline> Was this part of your plan?
[2:42:40] <Ropcord> the CIA is here, that's always good news :)
[2:43:02] <dukenux> This game is dedicated to make shit getting progressively worse.
[2:43:02] <rumuloh> I like how woolie's response to being shot while peeking out of cover is to leave said cover
[2:43:03] <mirum> the story is great but the cover mechanics can be a real pain
[2:43:04] <jorniev> if you die a lot i think it keeps trying to give you easy mode

[2:45:35] <star_feline> Minh "Not enough time for warcrime" T
[2:45:37] <jorniev> look at that dude just bleeding out on the floor
[2:46:00] <Run44forrest> using cardboard boxes as cover LUL
[2:46:02] <Sydin18> Think about the bones!! D:
[2:46:15] <+RealThiele> Compassion is a rarity on the battlefield
[2:46:17] <jorniev> gould is the only decent person in this mess
[2:46:28] <@Solidus_113> look at that dino skeleton
[2:46:29] <derap41> Look at the boxes
[2:46:30] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> so what was the super deep story of this game again?
[2:46:35] <BallinArbiter> War crimes blossom on the battlefield
[2:46:43] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> you're a bad person because the game forced you to do violence?
[2:46:46] <CrabSlacks> now is time for running
[2:46:52] <SilentPredator03> @jorniev nah, dude is CIA and therefore still a piece of shit
[2:46:52] <Prevot> war is bad
[2:46:53] <StarlitStunner> Love blooms on the battlefield
[2:46:53] <FennecZephyr> Oh is this the new LP
[2:47:04] <+nekodelic> @mc_weak_to_arrow it's not deep, it's a simple concept very well executed
[2:47:08] <+QueequegTheater> Run motherfucker
[2:47:08] <Prevot> A HIND D?
[2:47:10] <dukenux> its not that deep, but its written well, probably better than 90% of shooters out there
[2:47:11] <star_feline> KKona Freebird?
[2:47:18] <+RealThiele> necromancy incoming
[2:47:18] <+Aeriqui> thats such a reductive take on the game
[2:47:19] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:47:23] <derap41> @Mc_weak_to_arrow that's why knowing about the premise of the game makes the game worse if you're playing this expecting a run of the mill shooter it works much better
[2:47:24] <dukenux> Fucking chopper part NotLikeThis
[2:47:26] <Run44forrest> jumped into the fire LUL
[2:47:27] <dukenux> FURY ROAD

[2:47:29] <BallinArbiter> Rip T. rex
[2:47:32] <CursedNobleman> SNAAAAAAKE
[2:47:32] <Ropcord> LUL
[2:47:32] <jorniev> and gould is still the only one trying and he is still bad, what does it say about everyone else
[2:47:34] <+Toblo1> SING! SING! SING!
[2:47:37] <dukenux> WHAT A DAY
[2:47:38] <star_feline> SourPls
[2:47:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> THIS SONG KICKS ASS
[2:47:40] <dukenux> WHAT A LOVELY DAY
[2:47:43] <thetrashman_sc> radioman is my hero
[2:47:45] <ShlickityShlim> SourPls
[2:47:47] <CrabSlacks> when everything kills you in one or two hits this part is CRAZY HARD
[2:47:54] <+RealThiele> i think the moral of this game is that everyone can equally suck
[2:47:54] <+Toblo1> Radioman is real entertaining
[2:47:56] <DeathByPoke7> i need scissors 61
[2:48:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> This part is really good
[2:48:02] <Louie_Salmon> Wait how slow was that missile going
[2:48:04] <+QueequegTheater> Radioman best waifu
[2:48:19] <+QueequegTheater> Alright, I'm back. Chat, we have any pop-offs yet?
[2:48:21] <+tearknack> landlord = bad guy woolie
[2:48:25] <CursedNobleman> hi queequeg, i love your fanfics (though i didnt read em)
[2:48:31] <Louie_Salmon> They like fully rolled in the time it took that missile to move 10 feet
[2:48:37] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @derap41 that's fair enough, the surprise later on really looses value if you know beforehand. still think the gameplay fails at connecting with the story tho
[2:48:38] <jorniev> is the audio ok for you guys?
[2:48:46] <rumuloh> Yes
[2:48:47] <star_feline> @QueequegTheater No but he got offered easy mode by the game
[2:48:47] <arkv01> eggxecuting them monkaS
[2:48:48] <CursedNobleman> the fun will be in 60 mins or s i think
[2:48:53] <+QueequegTheater> @star_feline LUL
[2:48:54] <dukenux> BTW: I ddidn't bought into meta "player is the real bad guy" narrative. but i do think the story is really solid even setting that aside
[2:49:03] <+RealThiele> cause people would just leave the richest city in the ME alone
[2:49:07] <+QueequegTheater> @CursedNobleman Yeah once they hit chapter 8 the fun begins
[2:49:19] <CrabSlacks> it's a good PTSD story
[2:49:22] <+l1tteljohn> agreed
[2:49:24] <DaBigVitus> hootie hooooo
[2:49:24] <dukenux> It's a deserving companion to Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now in a video game medium
[2:49:35] <thetrashman_sc> walker what was the mission??
[2:49:38] <TigerClaws12> >what's right
[2:49:38] <CursedNobleman> @QueequegTheater oh yesssssss
[2:49:50] <+QueequegTheater> @dukenux Because that's not the actual metanarrative, the metanarrative is player control vs. character control
[2:49:50] <Prevot> wait didnt the guy have a fucked up leg how did he jump down
[2:49:51] <arkv01> what chapter are we on
[2:49:56] <+nekodelic> @realthiele and that a lot of people who act on behalf of a cause that assures them that they're doing the right thing, even though they aren't, should think more critically about what they're doing
[2:49:56] <zamzoph> A Way Out
[2:49:57] <CursedNobleman> welp, 7
[2:49:58] <Run44forrest> is the fun gonna go bad by them stopping it and finishing it later?
[2:49:58] <+MrRabbles> everything before now was just for fun
[2:50:00] <+Aeriqui> Walker the MISSION
[2:50:13] <derap41> @Mc_weak_to_arrow the whole point of the gameplay is to be gamey and very trope like to make you follow your pre established shooter instincts
[2:50:15] <+RealThiele> Mission is to fuck bitches, get money
[2:50:18] <Ultimatefool> I wish more games like this got big budgets instead of Call of Duty being the same shit every year
[2:50:20] <+QueequegTheater> Reminder that Walker committed dereliction of duty and insubordination in the first chapter
[2:50:21] <dukenux> @QueequegTheater sure, but i think the game can defend itself, even without metanarrative. Story wise
[2:50:27] <ScreamLord> Oh...Woolie is playing THAT game.
[2:50:29] <star_feline> FeelsGoodMan Halo? which one?
[2:50:42] <CursedNobleman> too much thinking, not enough shooty bang bang

[2:50:47] <dukenux> Featuring that one guy from GTA IV
[2:50:48] <jorniev> THIS GAME
[2:50:50] <derap41> @Mc_weak_to_arrow You have to think that following what the game tells you and doing what it says will lead you to a good ending
[2:50:54] <+QueequegTheater> @dukenux Oh yeah, for sure, but like 60% of it is Nolan North acting as hard as he can
[2:51:14] <+RealThiele> Goa'uld NOT trsytworthy

[2:51:44] <warmnoid> pretty
[2:51:48] <+Toblo1> Thats A Big Wipeout
[2:51:49] <CursedNobleman> oh, i mean MIIIIIIKE
[2:51:50] <derap41> @Mc_weak_to_arrow then the game turn around and tell you that because you didn't think of your own action that you did just follow along with what it told you committed horrible actions
[2:51:52] <star_feline> might?
[2:51:53] <+lukedu_> RIP Mike, he knew a good bar
[2:51:56] <+nekodelic> @realthiele case in point: soldiers that enlist with the intent of "serving their country" without realising that that may not be the best idea (although a lot of people join the military for other reasons)
[2:52:00] <+QueequegTheater> I love the radioman
[2:52:12] <star_feline> monkaS
[2:52:15] <+RealThiele> yea, that 28% interest charger kid is an idiot
[2:52:18] <Solidnick18> ok then
[2:52:23] <ScreamLord> Just the one?
[2:52:26] <+jiggy_snipe> so the point is that everyone is a villian?
[2:52:28] <Aussie_Manny> Not a one.

[2:52:35] <DaBigVitus> only minh laughed LUL
[2:52:36] <jorniev> NO ONE IN THIS WHOLE SHIT

[2:52:37] <foreverN2dust> Mihn giggling at that kinda scares me
[2:52:40] <Ropcord> monkaS
[2:52:41] <dukenux> I don't think they receive any other radio station

[2:53:21] <dukenux> We're at the human tree forest
[2:53:21] <LozsCat> Willy pete time
[2:53:22] <muniea3> who hangs 'em that high?
[2:53:28] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @derap41 yeah i get it, and it IS cool, it's just that it runs into the problem of "it's supposed to be bad" only in this game is "it's supposed to be generic" y'know.
[2:53:31] <mrblack499> why are there so many bt's here
[2:53:34] <+Aeriqui> willy pete is a swell guy
[2:53:36] <%Irridium> heroes. heroes hang them that high
[2:53:42] <CrabSlacks> I feel like hitting someone with a sticky grenade should be a war crime
[2:53:48] <Run44forrest> thats some fist of the north star shit
[2:53:48] <%gatorafan> Walker, I NEED to talk to you boput G O U R D S
[2:53:51] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @derap41 i don't like it when the Nier guy does it either
[2:53:55] <+RealThiele> at the time it was a breath of fresh air to all the otehr generic military shoorterman games
[2:54:12] <jorniev> thismelee
[2:54:13] <dukenux> @Mc_weak_to_arrow Opinions on Bioshock, Undertale?
[2:54:31] <jorniev> GET IN THERE WOOLIE
[2:54:39] <derap41> @Mc_weak_to_arrow I can get that but that's just a necessity to marriage the gameplay to the thesis if they didn't do it it would weaken the thesis.
[2:54:46] <+RealThiele> get in the warcrime, woolie
[2:54:48] <rumuloh> @CrabSlacks It would be
[2:54:51] <Run44forrest> wasted the whole clip LUL
[2:54:54] <mirum> woolie uses the squad mechanics a lot more than I did while playing
[2:54:55] <+QueequegTheater> I appreciate this game having a somewhat realistic amount of ammunition being carried
[2:54:58] <derap41> These are some strange trees
[2:54:59] <+nekodelic> @mc_weak_to_arrow tbf the gameplay issues with this game are more likely to be due to budget and development, but it works for what the game is trying to do
[2:55:13] <+RealThiele> that flop
[2:55:13] <rumuloh> Strange fruits
[2:55:15] <CursedNobleman> not kewl woolie, you shot him in the balls
[2:55:24] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @dukenux undertale surprises you pretty well and it has the merit that you get a real choice on it, you have multiple very different endings after all, instead of being forced down one. bioshock is good but not as interesting as some people think it is IMO
[2:55:25] <Solidnick18> move up
[2:55:25] <+Razputin217> DAMMIT BUTTERS
[2:55:29] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie shot his dick off

[2:55:40] <TigerClaws12> big oof LUL
[2:55:50] <derap41> Soon comes Battle Karen
[2:55:51] <thetrashman_sc> not having a choice is the point in this game

[2:55:54] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie desperate to make sure the black man dies first

[2:56:00] <jorniev> swich it up switch it up
[2:56:18] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @nekodelic yeah when taking into consideration the budget it is pretty understandable, that's valid. again similar to how nier faces budget problems and you just have to accept it

[2:56:51] <derap41> Look at those boxes
[2:56:59] <dukenux> yeah, Undertale was the one that flet overhyped to me. Still a cute game, though. And Bioshock twist was fine, if not for the game falling apart after.
[2:57:00] <SilentPredator03> the gun is fine, but you can't snipe with a smg
[2:57:15] <+RealThiele> sniper machine gun, its in the name bruh

[2:57:34] <ShlickityShlim> This sounds like a wrestler intro theme
[2:57:43] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @dukenux oh yeah undertale definitely isn't the second coming of christ, but it does deserve some merit. also absolutely agreed on the second half of bioshock. also wtf is up with that final boss

[2:58:29] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:58:29] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @derap41 then maybe the thesis ain't that compatible with a videogame
[2:58:33] <SilentPredator03> you gotta shoot the wall
[2:58:37] <+QueequegTheater> They did it anyway
[2:58:37] <Solidnick18> they got him
[2:58:39] <dukenux> IT WORKED
[2:58:39] <arkv01> fuckface D:
[2:58:39] <Sydin18> Woolie about to Thanos SNAP
[2:58:51] <+nekodelic> @mc_weak_to_arrow funnily enough, I think the way Undertale gives you the option to do a pacifist run kinda weakens the concept. It's a way for the player to get away "clean" from the game, but maybe I'm just nitpicking
[2:58:53] <derap41> @Mc_weak_to_arrow The thesis is about video games specifically military shooters
[2:59:03] <+RealThiele> farts
[2:59:33] <CursedNobleman> Thesis: Shootybangbang is fun, pewpew is not as fun as the bangbang
[2:59:45] <+RealThiele> all i want, is bangbangbang

[3:00:58] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @nekodelic well but doing the pacifist path leads to a very difficult version of the game, so it does make some sense, to give an example of the same idea worse implemented, in bioshock it's just as easy to be a good guy and not kill the girls as it is being an edgy evil guy

[3:01:56] <DedlokPM> Hey! It's the thing that Call of Duty gamified and people totally defended them using because "they already have nukes so why not this?"
[3:01:58] <DatAsuna> when walker is completely still it looks weird
[3:01:59] <+QueequegTheater> Ah man loading screens haven't changed yet
[3:01:59] <%kyh9> It was CoD Modern Warfare I think
[3:02:07] <%kyh9> The new Modern Warfare
[3:02:09] <+Nomicro4u> Flamethrowers are still cool guy looks?
[3:02:12] <alrobot2014> well the good thing about woolie dying is that he wont miss load screens
[3:02:13] <+RealThiele> call in the A10 to BRRRRRRRRRRRT some hamburger
[3:02:15] <DatAsuna> yeah cod
[3:02:20] <Run44forrest> it was white phosphorus grenades for your loadout i think
[3:02:21] <UnfilteredComic> Agent Orange Poggers
[3:02:22] <+l1tteljohn> CoD is propaganda, pass it on :)
[3:02:24] <dukenux> Yeah, officialy its used for smoke cover, but here and there... someone uses it horribly wrong
[3:02:27] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> if anyone wants the movie equivalent of this go watch "Funny games", it's really cool
[3:02:33] <@Solidus_113> Mustard Gas was used in Battlefield One wasn't it?
[3:02:35] <derap41> If funny how CoD hasn't changed at all even with it going Scifi
[3:02:37] <+Nomicro4u> SHOOT EM WOOLIE
[3:02:38] <%DesertPenguin> this is so fucked
[3:02:39] <thetrashman_sc> funny games is just ok
[3:02:40] <Ropcord> YAY, WAR CRIMES FeelsAmazingMan
[3:02:41] <+Nomicro4u> PUT EM OUT OF THEIR MISERY
[3:02:42] <+professormorrigan> War... war is heck.
[3:02:42] <+QueequegTheater> White phosphorous is basically the Vyvans to mustard gas's adderall: it's stronger, longer lasting, and way more dangerous
[3:02:50] <BallinArbiter> Maybe there were people in the smoke screen area who knows
[3:03:00] <+nekodelic> honestly, COD would be very hypocritical if they did a real anti-war take on military games
[3:03:03] <Run44forrest> i miss dumb future cod
[3:03:03] <DatAsuna> mustard gas aka paige gas
[3:03:06] <%kyh9> it's the white phosphorus
[3:03:07] <derap41> The us Still use it for "smoke screening"
[3:03:08] <+nekodelic> @mc_weak_to_arrow amazing film
[3:03:09] <+QueequegTheater> Grenade woolie
[3:03:25] <+RealThiele> we will screen your lungs, with our smoke
[3:03:28] <+Nomicro4u> EXECUTE
[3:03:28] <+Toblo1> No, it was just sustained fire
[3:03:30] <dukenux> So... i knew about White Phosphorus before playing it, and after this scene i was like "Huh? This wasn't THAT bad".
[3:03:32] <dukenux> Kappa
[3:03:34] <CrabSlacks> he was just shot by the heavies SAW
[3:03:37] <DedlokPM> @Run44forrest nope. Literal air strike drop. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAqIMLbUIAABCxP?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
[3:03:41] <thetrashman_sc> mw1 wasnt really "anti war" but it had some themes
[3:03:43] <dukenux> little did i know
[3:03:43] <DatAsuna> kill them all woolie
[3:03:44] <+RealThiele> walker is wolverine
[3:03:44] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @nekodelic yep, especially the tv remote thing at the end
[3:03:46] <+Toblo1> Yeah the heavy gunner will *CHEW* you up if you let it
[3:03:52] <djazo> war is bad doodSad
[3:04:00] <+QueequegTheater> @dukenux It works best when going in blind, because the game was literally marketed as just another MW1 clone
[3:04:03] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:04:03] <%Irridium> new modern warfare's themes are "you know what soldiers need? ZERO oversight!"
[3:04:04] <jorniev> war is pretty fucking bad
[3:04:07] <@Solidus_113> up on the Dpad
[3:04:15] <ScreamLord> Yeah. Snipers are NEVER useful in an urban environment
[3:04:23] <+QueequegTheater> @dukenux So the willy pete comes as a massive collar yank

[3:07:22] <+professormorrigan> The answer is always GUN.
[3:07:23] <+theAncopro> wait is no save
[3:07:24] <DaBigVitus> choices should be more obvious
[3:07:27] <Solidnick18> well save one man or a bunch
[3:07:28] <T_Sasquatch> It's a choice. This game makes it very obvious
[3:07:28] <CrabSlacks> follow one or order a kill
[3:07:32] <+Toblo1> The choice is mainly "Go with Adams" or "Shoot with Lugo"

[3:12:57] <%razielhex> The US military does not condone the killing of unarmed combatants. But this isn't real, so why should you care?
[3:12:59] <Run44forrest> big hero woolie shoots a man in the back
[3:13:01] <SilentPredator03> you don't have any grenades
[3:13:03] <dukenux> Heavies need to be shot in the face
[3:13:11] <derap41> @razielhex he knows enough though hearsay
[3:13:15] <+chesterr01> @realthiele LUL
[3:13:30] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie thought he had a grenade launcher but it's a silencer
[3:13:34] <+QueequegTheater> Between the legs. This ain't hockey
[3:13:38] <%razielhex> This game was development hell, but it's so worth it, especially when that Mogwai hits in and goes GLASGOW MEGA SNAKE
[3:13:45] <CrabSlacks> I'm pretty sure there's an RPG near him
[3:13:45] <+Mrthefro> Well, this is unexpected. Is he enjoying it?
[3:13:45] <+RealThiele> dicksplosion
[3:13:51] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:13:51] <dukenux> Woolie's aiming at the center of mass: the balls.
[3:13:55] <Solidnick18> sniper elite is a great
[3:13:59] <@Solidus_113> Sniper V2 has that
[3:13:59] <Solidnick18> game
[3:14:07] <arkv01> explodin balls huh
[3:14:07] <+Javaa01> Mihn, you can shoot them in all of them after the second one
[3:14:13] <MojoKingIzakku> Minh is looking very fresh today @WoolieVersus
[3:14:14] <%razielhex> Okay, I missed the interstate choice. What did he do? Did he make the false choice?
[3:14:14] <Dhurkst> BITE ZA DASUTO
[3:14:24] <mirum> is he playing on hard mode? he's dying so fast
[3:14:27] <alrobot2014> the interstate choice hasn't happened yet
[3:14:28] <Solidnick18> @arkv01 yeah you can snipe hitlers balls
[3:14:33] <@Solidus_113> There's a DLC mission in Elite V2 where you kill Hitler, and if you shoot him in the balls you can see he only has 1
[3:14:33] <+QueequegTheater> @mirum No, normal
[3:14:38] <%razielhex> Okay, so not gonna spoil *that*
[3:14:42] <SilentPredator03> @mirum nah. this game is pretty hard even on normal
[3:15:04] <%razielhex> And he's going mission-critical I see
[3:15:11] <derap41> Yeah that's band of brothers I think
[3:15:13] <+mcjimbles> Just dropping by to say very appreciative that Gon in 60 seconds is back
[3:15:20] <derap41> or saving private ryan
[3:15:21] <+RealThiele> silent "pink eye" scope
[3:15:24] <+QueequegTheater> I love the snipers just running away like coward
[3:15:26] <%razielhex> @WoolieVersus Can you even remember why you came here?
[3:15:38] <primaryfire> really surprised woolie doesn't consider saving the civs, since game logic would have him progress the story even without gould's info
[3:15:39] <+QueequegTheater> Use grenades
[3:15:40] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 14 months! holy shit I cant believe Woolie is playing this underrated masterpiece
[3:15:50] <alrobot2014> woolie personally isn't reading chat due to spoilers @razielhex
[3:15:57] <dukenux> HE COMIN
[3:16:01] <+QueequegTheater> OH LAWD
[3:16:11] <gordieda20> HEAVY BOI
[3:16:13] <SilentPredator03> @primaryfire woolie's not great at understanding what the game is telling him. he probably doesn't realize what he needs to do to save the civies
[3:16:18] <+MrRabbles> i don't think woolie knew how to save the civilians so he just did what was in front of him
[3:16:18] <Aussie_Manny> Nolan North. :D
[3:16:38] <elitedeltatm> Emancipate the citizens
[3:16:41] <+MrRabbles> Which is why its so weird that the civilians aren't in the scene because that would be the default player action
[3:16:48] <CrabSlacks> thank god for sweet healing adrenaline shots
[3:16:48] <Aussie_Manny> Spread freedom (tm).
[3:16:50] <Ganfur> I was trying to save the civs yet i still fucked up somehow
[3:16:54] <%razielhex> Spoilers for 121 year old story, so yeah
[3:17:03] <derap41> Woolie is doing exactly what he is meant to be doing. Not know what he is doing
[3:17:15] <thetrashman_sc> yeah that choice is kind of a weird read on first glance

[3:21:19] <%razielhex> @dukenux That's the brilliance of the writing; they become more and more unhinged and angry as the game progresses. By the end of it they're literally just screaming "FUUUUUUUCK!"
[3:21:20] <%ultrasparkseid> LUL

[3:22:43] <%razielhex> There's 4 endings to this game
[3:22:43] <+Toblo1> The direction is Extremely Powerful
[3:22:44] <hntronium> Very Kubrick
[3:22:46] <+RealThiele> big warcrimes
[3:22:47] <%razielhex> so I am curious how he does it

[3:23:25] <+QueequegTheater> I grew up in Chicago, that gave me a natural +2 defense against bullets
[3:23:29] <%TheSniperJoe> You always save your actors voices, because you are NEVER their only job that day, or even that week, no matter how big your job is.
[3:23:30] <%razielhex> All War is Class War. You're being victimized, the media just convinces you to sympathize with those exploiting you.
[3:23:32] <arkv01> we just wanna milk sap outta our trees and turn it into pancake syrup
[3:23:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> Real talk guys Do you think well actually have a WW3 one day?

[3:24:16] <+QueequegTheater> Nah, it's added in before the other multipliers tho
[3:24:25] <+RealThiele> s u b v e r t e d
[3:24:33] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> metal gear solid, hotline miami, this game
[3:24:34] <%kyh9> Games about war suffer from routine Ludonarrative disco pants
[3:24:35] <+chaumiester> MW2, that's when it happened
[3:24:39] <@Solidus_113> MoH Frontline
[3:24:41] <%razielhex> Medal of Honor
[3:24:41] <floralkami> we doing Garou later?
[3:24:43] <%Ecchigun> Medal of honor
[3:24:44] <@Solidus_113> was the first
[3:24:45] <%TheSniperJoe> Isn't it this game that has the slowed down headshots, not to make you feel like a sick badass but to REALLY drive home that you're KILLING people?
[3:25:00] <%razielhex> Original Call of Duty 1 was probably the first big "STALINGRAD!" game
[3:25:01] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> call of duty 1 actually did it well
[3:25:01] <hntronium> Yeah, its sick badass
[3:25:04] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> unironically
[3:25:05] <%barkon345> probably the point where your walking in an airport with Terrorists mowing down civilians
[3:25:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> new wolfenstein is amazing
[3:25:06] <Solidnick18> call of duty 2 did d day i think
[3:25:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's a long game though
[3:25:19] <MTLxSpider> aeroThink
[3:25:20] <+chaumiester> Nope
[3:25:22] <derap41> Little under halfway
[3:25:27] <+Javaa01> You're about 40-ish % through with it
[3:25:27] <G_Lancaster> 1/3
[3:25:27] <DatAsuna> nah like 20%
[3:25:28] <rumuloh> Wolfenstein was shit, play Doom instead
[3:25:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> not quite
[3:25:29] <%razielhex> Woolie and Reggie playing Youngblood together.
[3:25:32] <+QueequegTheater> They're right before the big moment everyone talks about
[3:25:41] <+QueequegTheater> Like half an hour
[3:25:41] <+chaumiester> Game is short, but.... somewhere at the 30% point I think
[3:25:54] <%razielhex> Spec-Ops is about a 6-7 hour game
[3:25:57] <Plugman86> oh, done in 3 sessions?
[3:26:12] <derap41> Far Cry 3 tried to do something similar but just failed so hard at it
[3:26:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:26:15] <DatAsuna> okay 30% but 20% if they reload for other endings. which they should
[3:26:18] <+nekodelic> @woolieversus a lot of military shooters rely on military weapons' manufacturers because of licensing and other stuff. so there's literal war money on the line for a lot of the biggest FPSs in the market
[3:26:26] <%razielhex> @WoolieVersus You can pick up enemy weapons when you run out, I think.
[3:26:29] <+QueequegTheater> YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
[3:26:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> I'm pretty sure it resumes at last checkpoint

[3:34:04] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Did you see the new character in Apex? Punch dude.
[3:34:04] <BearSawed> Its called Apex capn pd, sorry I dont like it either
[3:34:21] <ghoulspan> woolie whens the fuck is NUNS 4
[3:34:21] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> to be fair the ps3 controller isn't very precise when it comes to that
[3:34:24] <jorniev> play! half life!
[3:34:28] <+aishman> Did you see Apex Legends new boy? It's a punch dude with a ROBO ARM
[3:34:41] <dukenux> i'd shit on woolie's aim, but i play shooters almost exclusively with M+KB, so i cant imagine my gamepad aim being much better
[3:34:42] <Lieutenant_America> Did I miss it?
[3:34:53] <derap41> It is a good game
[3:34:53] <Prevot> the nuns are being slowly filled, they are not ready to burst yet

[3:35:01] <Lieutenant_America> Spec Ops is super good
[3:35:05] <@Solidus_113> "underrated"
[3:35:07] <arkv01> yeah, spec ops is kewl
[3:35:08] <%razielhex> Follow-up Spec OPs: The Line with Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. Just fuck yourself up.
[3:35:11] <+QueequegTheater> >underrated Kappa
[3:35:15] <+nekodelic> Woolie playing different types of games is pretty cool
[3:35:16] <AlastorThrice> spec ops is super great, but the gameplay is *not* the draw. I'd almost suggest playing on easy mode.
[3:35:17] <hntronium> underrated my ass
[3:35:18] <Arblaster_> Nice that it's relativly short too
[3:35:19] <Solidnick18> woolies expanding
[3:35:23] <derap41> But its best when you player a lot of military shooters
[3:35:27] <G_Lancaster> GalGun2 full LP confirmed
[3:35:33] <hntronium> this game gets too much dicksucking
[3:35:38] <+Javaa01> It's far from underrated these days, but it was mostly ignored at launch

[3:39:22] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus AC4, 5, and 0 are the holy trinity of fly plane shooty bang games
[3:39:25] <arkv01> 5 was the one that put AC on a lot of radars
