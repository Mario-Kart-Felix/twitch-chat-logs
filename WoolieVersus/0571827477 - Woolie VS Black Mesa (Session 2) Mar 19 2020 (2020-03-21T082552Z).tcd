[0:15:53] <BeijiWeng> the G lacG squadQ
[0:15:55] <Haarute> that DOESN'T mean "crowbar everything" though
[0:16:06] <andrei11dr> HURT ME MORE DOG!

[0:16:12] <DedlokPM> rooHaz RedTeam rooGun
[0:16:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @captainpiledriver OOF SIZE: OMNI-TRANSCENDENTAL
[0:16:16] <+glgzephyr> surely someone has done a no hit run
[0:16:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> Play good not perfectly
[0:16:19] <%RioGascar> i've seen speedruns but STILL peopel take damage
[0:16:27] <MassConnect> sounds like a job for mitten squad
[0:16:30] <%RioGascar> i dont think so
[0:16:31] <@akuda_bar> https://clips.twitch.tv/BrainyAbrasiveSoymilkDatSheffy
[0:16:37] <%Javaa01> Damage is a core part of speedrunning Half Life anyways
[0:16:37] <+glgzephyr> that menu sound is therapeutic
[0:16:44] <PsychedelicSnake> Remember, there is totally going to be soldiers coming tohelp you. Only help you. Nothing else.
[0:16:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, yeah, those marvel characters suck
[0:16:51] <+jiggy_snipe> my favorite is the Memelord Kappa
[0:17:07] <LeaIsChill> Who let that pigeon in?
[0:17:09] <BeijiWeng> comedyOkay 👍
[0:17:21] <%Javaa01> For now
[0:17:24] <+glgzephyr> who ever heard of a lapdesk
[0:17:24] <andrei11dr> Once the military show's up he'll probably stop crowbaring everything
[0:17:25] <%Irridium> gotta get yourself a couchmaster
[0:17:28] <fuji_92> @woolieversus
[0:17:43] <$megamonmon123> @captainpiledriver they are on the new warriors not the avengers. They were never meant to "save" marvel
[0:17:50] <DedlokPM> Get a Gamer Cube to solve your Mouse On Couch woes. psaWhat
[0:17:51] <%Javaa01> You can, you just hold the watch button
[0:17:54] <StarlitStunner> A gamer cube like Patto
[0:17:57] <UnfilteredComic> RP waik
[0:17:58] <+glgzephyr> I am sitting in bed right now with my keyboard and mouse on my lapdesk and it is the shit
[0:18:01] <Haarute> you hold the walk button.
[0:18:02] <Djinnazz> Shift
[0:18:02] <+kitsisto> its SOOOOOO frustrating
[0:18:03] <Seamus_McKraken> I still don't understand how anyone uses a controller for FPS games
[0:18:04] <%Javaa01> Because Half Life doesn't have a run button, it has a walk button
[0:18:11] <%tearfuldevil> yes you can
[0:18:13] <fuji_92> Gamer Cubes rise up
[0:18:15] <LeaIsChill> Would you invest in a pressure sensitive WASD?
[0:18:19] <%Javaa01> Black Mesa added the run button
[0:18:19] <+sir_louis> LUL
[0:18:21] <Laironx3> keyboard and controller bitterSmug
[0:18:22] <majima666> i dont have a problem using controllers in fps games
[0:18:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> @megamonmon123 some of the first new characters they've made that are supposed to be inclusive and it's those
[0:18:24] <%tearfuldevil> in games with walk/run/sprint states
[0:18:25] <Djinnazz> You totally can
[0:18:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @LeaIsChill yes
[0:18:27] <+Exyoh> There's no inbetween for shift or no shift
[0:18:27] <@Solidus_113> good games usually have a walk toggle
[0:18:28] <majima666> but thats cause im a console pleb
[0:18:36] <BeijiWeng> jbxDong
[0:18:37] <+jiggy_snipe> probably need a toggle or button
[0:18:38] <fuji_92> mouse and controller DansGame

[0:20:41] <Dramtheater> dramthFeelsHei
[0:20:44] <Bennett_Fracture> can we discuss aboot the number 3...
[0:20:44] <iseath> Reggie and Woolie RE 3 Remake in the future?
[0:20:45] <%linSP> RE6 PogChamp
[0:20:45] <%tearfuldevil> no but he does love the crowbar so far
[0:20:46] <+lutefiiisk> how slow has he been playing
[0:20:53] <fuji_92> open it now
[0:20:56] <%tearfuldevil> not that slow
[0:20:56] <%RioGascar> i believe you can re open these
[0:21:00] <+Nod80> sorry 3
[0:21:00] <%tearfuldevil> but still pretty slow
[0:21:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lutefiiisk MAX LEVEL SNAIL LIFE

[0:21:10] <fist_wizard_jay> Achtung minen
[0:21:11] <+lutefiiisk> Snailens!
[0:21:12] <Bennett_Fracture> 3 is a number...
[0:21:17] <+jiggy_snipe> be a gamer and test it Kappa
[0:21:25] <%Javaa01> Red lasers can't be destroyed, only avoided
[0:21:29] <Bennett_Fracture> it comes after 2...
[0:21:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> @megamonmon123 those characters are just as bad as those shitty edgy characters from the 90's era, written by people who don't understand anything
[0:21:44] <%Irridium> are you still there~
[0:21:50] <Bennett_Fracture> 3 is also a crowd...
[0:21:53] <%RioGascar> this segment is very smart
[0:21:55] <zamzoph> I think the game is trying to tell you something
[0:21:55] <FuqBoiSlim> you cant crowbar your way out of this one
[0:22:00] <%RioGascar> it shows how EVERYTHING WORKS
[0:22:05] <PsychedelicSnake> but grenades tho
[0:22:10] <beatie_g> wait aren't those millitary turrets?
[0:22:17] <%RioGascar> turrets are not discriminating and just fire at anyone
[0:22:21] <honeyman18> Activator, not a multi use
[0:22:22] <LeaIsChill> Explosions are...big?
[0:22:24] <$megamonmon123> @captainpiledriver im not saying they are good but this is less desparation and more a really really dumb idea
[0:22:25] <PsychedelicSnake> Woolie, explosions have a wave of concussive force
[0:22:29] <andrei11dr> Look at all of those grenades
[0:22:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:22:32] <%Javaa01> Don't eat the explosions
[0:22:40] <DSD24> Look a these dead rescue team members
[0:22:41] <%tearfuldevil> its fairly realistic explosions
[0:22:43] <%Javaa01> TNT is bad for your diet
[0:22:45] <+DesertPenguin> Anyone ever drink Jack Daniel's Gentleman's Reserve? It's fucking tasty
[0:22:54] <VJdarkworld> Its SHRAPNEL ! i guess (?)
[0:22:56] <Zeemod155> h3ll0?
[0:22:56] <@Solidus_113> HelLO?
[0:23:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> @megamonmon123 fair enough
[0:23:06] <Rosewater_444> h
[0:23:07] <+jiggy_snipe> Shrapnel and concussive blow
[0:23:08] <@Solidus_113> I don't blame you
[0:23:25] <majima666> @DesertPenguin probably once or twice. jack and coke is my poison and ive had some of the different varients
[0:23:26] <Rosewater_444> that big
[0:23:29] <PsychedelicSnake> Explosions are to Woolie as slide puzzles are to Pat
[0:23:29] <%Gwimbles> Explosions make a big shockwave that fucks shit up.
[0:23:33] <Seamus_McKraken> thats actually huge
[0:23:36] <%RioGascar> @WoolieVersus Tip: barrels and explosive boxs in half life dont explode instantly unless shot a lot. if you shoot it 3 times it first sets on fire for a short time and then explodes. this allows you to run away
[0:23:38] <Rosewater_444> in all directiond
[0:23:41] <honeyman18> Vaguely big booms
[0:23:44] <%tearfuldevil> get that shield woolie
[0:23:46] <Seamus_McKraken> compared to the original and HL2
[0:23:48] <+DesertPenguin> I've been a fan of the Jack Daniels Honey but my parents got a shit ton of stuff when they went to the Caribbean in February
[0:23:49] <%tearfuldevil> please
[0:23:51] <+DesertPenguin> It's so cheap there
[0:23:52] <$megamonmon123> so who's the power bottom:chel or gordon?
[0:24:04] <Snorlax47> *teleport behind you*
[0:24:09] <%linSP> Yo portal 2 couch coop with Reggie would be dope
[0:24:11] <%tearfuldevil> gordon
[0:24:13] <%Gwimbles> Like if you're underwater when an explosion goes off your lungs will cave in and collapse because of the pressure caused by the shockwave
[0:24:15] <PsychedelicSnake> HAHA

[0:27:12] <FuqBoiSlim> what color was the dress, chat? I remember it being blue and white
[0:27:14] <Bennett_Fracture> i still want to discuss aboot the number 3...
[0:27:24] <+aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Here's money for punch daddy! As always I want to thank you for rekindling my love of Fighting Games, and now Strive is a Day One buy from me. God I hope the rollback netcode is well implemented.
[0:27:35] <beatie_g> I don't hate you... :(
[0:27:47] <%Javaa01> Once the turrets that are assigned to a laser are destoyed, the laser turns off
[0:27:52] <Bennett_Fracture> spin it around and 3 can becom E... W... and M...
[0:27:54] <%Louie_Salmon> Oof
[0:27:56] <PsychedelicSnake> Why is Woolie's run stuttering so much
[0:27:59] <%RioGascar> this god damn game improved so much on half life 1's formula and design
[0:28:01] <bleugh> dat source jitter
[0:28:01] <DSD24> Damn that shotgun nearly broke the game
[0:28:08] <+DesertPenguin> It's so weird to see FPS games played without ADS
[0:28:09] <Seamus_McKraken> if the turret has a camera to detect targets, why does it need a triplaser?
[0:28:10] <SomersaultJustice> does the game stutter like that often?
[0:28:17] <@Solidus_113> doo doo
[0:28:19] <+croxeye> so have the military helped to rescue woolie yet :V?
[0:28:21] <PsychedelicSnake> It didn't stutter on mine
[0:28:22] <+chvmpchange> Its so wierd because I just played through the entire game and I didnt get a single stutter
[0:28:27] <mMayrro> woolie I think your pc is dying... psaWhat
[0:28:29] <%Javaa01> It's building a cache, so it's a bit stuttery
[0:28:33] <SorinMarkov54> Garry’s Mod has a VR add on
[0:28:34] <natebud> Grenades are very bad in this game. Even worse than OG half life
[0:28:36] <AlfredoCavatelli> you can bind grenade throw to a button in the options
[0:28:37] <honeyman18> Source engine is a pile of ductape on the quake 1 engine so yeah, its gonna be like that
[0:28:37] <%tearfuldevil> @chvmpchange black mes, or og hl1?
[0:28:38] <%Javaa01> When new assets need to be called
[0:28:39] <%Irridium> ah the old days where grenades were a weapon you had to swap to
[0:28:41] <beatie_g> idk what it is but I'll blame windows updates regardless
[0:28:43] <+DesertPenguin> I just had to install updates to Windows10 this morning. Anyone else?
[0:28:43] <+chvmpchange> he definitely has it installed on an HDD
[0:28:43] <UnfilteredComic> I didnt have any stutter when i played, maybe there is bad setting on
[0:28:45] <+Tunamanguy> @WoolieVersus pick it up
[0:28:46] <%Javaa01> Grenade

[0:28:47] <Tucker0603> on keyboard G is the shortcut to equip and throw

[0:36:01] <%king_wragles> @akuda_bar "now you now" : p

[0:36:15] <%Javaa01> RELOAD
[0:36:18] <polish_spring> no they dont
[0:36:19] <NotHereToStream> 9mm = pistol and smg
[0:36:21] <polish_spring> do they?
[0:36:25] <%RioGascar> its because they are both 9mm
[0:36:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always be reloading

[0:37:08] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[0:37:08] <+D00msDayDan> woolie would do it for a jetpack without hesitation
[0:37:11] <+jiggy_snipe> they probably tell them something to justify it
[0:37:13] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Imagine how surprised they are to find Freeman gunning them down
[0:37:14] <ShitpostGaming> The same people who use controllers to play fps games probably. Pure psychopaths.

[0:37:28] <%Javaa01> So don't
[0:37:30] <%Gwimbles> I can't believe @woolieversus would kill those soldiers just trying it help him. I can't believe he wrote in their blood that he doesn't support the troops and HATES America, what an evil villain. We HAVE to stop this man
[0:37:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Put a barrel in their grasp
[0:37:43] <rubbishbinge> nerds are always tainted
[0:37:45] <+chvmpchange> Woolie would 100% Join the Combine Overwatch with ZERO hesitation
[0:37:48] <StarlitStunner> Barnacles love you stripLuv
[0:37:55] <natebud> @seenseen wait until woolie is scrolling between 18 weapons

[0:51:13] <thesoothe> They didn't shoot him?
[0:51:26] <%RioGascar> the man who knew too much
[0:51:29] <Solidnick18> Oh no
[0:51:31] <nothuzad> chronoxgp what about pso2?
[0:51:35] <%shradke> FPS Dom Woolie
[0:51:37] <natebud> the marine AI is reaaaaally bad @thesoothe
[0:51:37] <%Javaa01> Maybe don't eat the explosive barrels
[0:51:45] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:51:46] <NevikGamina> man Woolie playing this like Doom LUL
[0:51:48] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:51:50] <BlkFlameKami> MY LEGS
[0:51:50] <Tucker0603> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:51:50] <%RioGascar> fancy attempt
[0:51:53] <Haarute> you don't NEED to run at and shotgun everything
[0:51:58] <chronoxgp> the currency in pso2 is meseta, so black mesa and meseata = blackked meseta
[0:52:01] <%shradke> pulling that DOOM ledge tech lol
[0:52:03] <Joestar1890> Woolie pls, just use the smg
[0:52:06] <Dr_Mooose> going for those glory kills
[0:52:10] <+chiazam> You suck bro
[0:52:10] <Solidnick18> this is doom Kappa
[0:52:13] <%Javaa01> They are NOT afraid to spam nades if you just sit in a corner
[0:52:16] <nothuzad> chronoxgp hm - ok try
[0:52:16] <andrei11dr> Woolie needs the environment upgrade from doom with those explosions LUL
[0:52:19] <thesoothe> @natebud I though they fixed that for release. Still looks bad compared to the original.
[0:52:25] <+Rewrench> at release marine AI was one of the big features. that they actually tried flanking and such. was new at the time
[0:52:35] <NevikGamina> this isn't Doom woolie LUL
[0:52:42] <%Javaa01> You will be, if you can aim
[0:52:43] <%shradke> tbf this is how it would realistically go
[0:52:45] <%RioGascar> they WILL voice their actiosn however
[0:52:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOT DOOM
[0:52:48] <%RioGascar> so listen for them
[0:52:50] <%Irridium> pistol works at range
[0:52:54] <Haarute> pistol has more accuracy
[0:53:06] <thesoothe> Oh man.
[0:53:10] <beatie_g> xcom'd
[0:53:13] <natebud> @thesoothe Not really. Also I found out they have a really hard time hitting you if you're standing still.
[0:53:14] <PsychedelicSnake> Use the automatic weapons more
[0:53:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> What even is accuracy?
[0:53:17] <+tuchpi> LUL
[0:53:17] <%Javaa01> The mouse is right there
[0:53:18] <+jiggy_snipe> lul
[0:53:20] <chronoxgp> if you remember the recoil pattern and paintball you'll do fine
[0:53:22] <%linSP> Jades work great too
[0:53:22] <%RioGascar> did they remove the hecu melee mouse?
[0:53:23] <andrei11dr> Maybe he should use range in this fps
[0:53:26] <FuqBoiSlim> CONTROLLER AIM LUL
[0:53:27] <%linSP> Nades *
[0:53:27] <%RioGascar> *move
[0:53:35] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Woolie don't worry I am totally the same way with First Person Shooters
[0:53:36] <beatie_g> WTF
[0:53:40] <%RioGascar> wait they have rocket launcehrs?
[0:53:44] <%RioGascar> never fucking saw that
[0:53:46] <PsychedelicSnake> I play with controller and I did fine. I think it's just Woolie trying to play this like DOOM
[0:53:48] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> wait... maybe worry I can never beat them lolz
[0:53:49] <beatie_g> was that always there?
[0:54:02] <%Javaa01> The RPGs are new, heavies have them now
[0:54:07] <$Essixian> I can't believe that worked LUL
[0:54:10] <natebud> Woolie don't move. stand completely still with the pistol and shoot them from a distance. They have no counter
[0:54:13] <andrei11dr> Just block those bullets with your face like Kenshiro
[0:54:13] <NWannabe> SG reload sounds giving me TF classic nostalgia
[0:54:14] <Th3rd3> Shotgun CQC
[0:54:24] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, there are still people around
[0:54:35] <beatie_g> really if you kill em fast enough they can't damage you you
[0:54:35] <FuqBoiSlim> uh oh
[0:54:35] <+Johannen> Game audio is realy loud
[0:54:49] <Zeemod155> ?
[0:54:51] <@Solidus_113> it's not really
[0:54:59] <@chesterr01> how is the audio during fights?
[0:55:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ignored the ammo on the counter
[0:55:04] <beatie_g> FUG
[0:55:05] <resloxxx> OOF
[0:55:06] <+prime_name> SPLAT
[0:55:07] <BlkFlameKami> GOING IN
[0:55:07] <%RyTYoung> mushy guts
[0:55:08] <Snorlax47> Pog
[0:55:08] <+chiazam> Just go
[0:55:13] <chronoxgp> whoolie you can get 1 or 2 really accurate shots with the pistol before recoil takes off
[0:55:15] <FuqBoiSlim> he exploded
[0:55:18] <beatie_g> shotgun > all
[0:55:23] <Haarute> the pistol has the most accuracy at range
[0:55:24] <%Javaa01> Oh this is babby shit
[0:55:25] <%Gwimbles> ^
[0:55:28] <@Solidus_113> You could say... It's Hostile
[0:55:29] <beatie_g> DOOM has taught you well I see
[0:55:31] <datdemo> Why does Wolie just run at them with a shotgun?
[0:55:32] <Snorlax47> Shot gun best gun
[0:55:34] <%linSP> Difference between doom and source is the ai bullets arrive instantly here so you can’t dodge and weave like those slow demon fireballs
[0:55:38] <bleugh> perhaps man is the true monster...
[0:55:40] <Zannablu_ke> maybe people are the real monsters after all...
[0:55:41] <%Gwimbles> I meant that arrow to point to the shotgun being best
[0:55:43] <%king_wragles> Does it not let Woolie setup a keybind for quick save and quick load?
[0:55:43] <%Gwimbles> Now I am the fool
[0:55:46] <$Essixian> Oh my god the shotgun reloads one more shell than it's supposed to every time, that is the fucking WORST BUG
[0:55:52] <chronoxgp> aim for the head whoolie
[0:55:55] <chronoxgp> or body
[0:55:58] <Joestar1890> Yes..."questioning"
[0:56:01] <resloxxx> "questioning" : how fast would you like to die sir?
[0:56:24] <Snorlax47> You got nothing, good day, sir
[0:56:25] <PsychedelicSnake> holy shit woolie
[0:56:36] <Zannablu_ke> i love woolie's jump ins on the enemies
[0:56:37] <thesoothe> Wouldn't he play a little better with a mouse?
[0:56:39] <%KingOfTheGeats> playing this like Doom
[0:56:40] <chronoxgp> he's playing with a controller omg what an idiot lol
[0:56:44] <PsychedelicSnake> fuckin rekt
[0:56:44] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:56:45] <+tuchpi> LUL
[0:56:46] <Dr_Mooose> dropped
[0:56:47] <Snorlax47> ded
[0:56:47] <natebud> @thesoothe of course
[0:56:48] <beatie_g> ow I tripped
[0:56:50] <Tucker0603> LUL LUL LUL
[0:56:50] <andrei11dr> Welp
[0:56:56] <%Irridium> git gud
[0:56:59] <%Javaa01> You track with the mouse
[0:57:00] <SomersaultJustice> and you're to blame
[0:57:01] <natebud> Just stand still with the pistol.
[0:57:02] <%RioGascar> i might have falsely prepared woolie for this game by saying DONT WORRY ABOUT DAMAGE
[0:57:04] <%Gwimbles> He should probably at least *try* the mouse
[0:57:06] <beatie_g> what's LIMA?
[0:57:08] <chronoxgp> we have reached new levels holy shit whoolie put the controller down, this is a SOURCE engine game
[0:57:08] <%NovaKnightmare> NovaKnightmare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Woolie, what's a worse situation: Escaping a facility attakced by Aliens and Special Forces or Doing a bunch of physics test for a homicial yet AI?
[0:57:11] <$Essixian> Woolie, the mouse and keyboard is RIGHT THERE.
[0:57:14] <+chiazam> Or the assault rifle
[0:57:15] <Djinnazz> Woolie still in Doom guy mode.
[0:57:15] <NevikGamina> haha yeah maybe @RioGascar LUL
[0:57:17] <PsychedelicSnake> shotgun is gonna kill woolie at some point
[0:57:17] <andrei11dr> Hand up LUL
[0:57:17] <Melchior_the_Wise> you need to use the smg
[0:57:28] <+chiazam> There’s no melee in this game
[0:57:33] <natebud> or just wait around the corner with the shotgun
[0:57:34] <PsychedelicSnake> At least we ca hope Woolie will mark out at the Tau cannon
[0:57:34] <emeraldskrull> woolieGLORY
[0:57:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> Machine gun is Kinda spray and pray
[0:57:39] <Djinnazz> Crowbar
[0:57:43] <%Javaa01> He dropped the nade
[0:57:46] <beatie_g> how
[0:57:47] <Tucker0603> I see Woolie is attempting the path of the facefuck
[0:57:55] <beatie_g> UNGA
[0:57:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[0:58:01] <natebud> grenades have a radius of like 2 feet
[0:58:02] <%Javaa01> Nah you're good
[0:58:03] <chronoxgp> can reggie play too like can he get trick shots and rim
[0:58:20] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:58:23] <@Solidus_113> better shotgun wins
[0:58:28] <+chiazam> Shields
[0:58:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tucker0603 It's not the worst if you know how to aim. But Woolie has forsaken the concept of aiming.
[0:58:30] <PsychedelicSnake> what's that saying about insanity again
[0:58:46] <%Gwimbles> Shit's crazy bro @psychedelicsnake
[0:58:53] <+chiazam> Use the pistol
[0:58:57] <@Solidus_113> it's always faster to switch weapons over reloading
[0:58:57] <+Rewrench> AI kiting woolie. thats kinda impressive :P
[0:59:04] <chronoxgp> whoolie's vert sensitivity is too high
[0:59:05] <%Javaa01> The HECU is relatively smart, even by last gen standards
[0:59:08] <thesoothe> Oh please. Black Mesa AI seems fucked.
[0:59:08] <%RioGascar> are those shotguns like the ones in half lfie 2 combien where they fire faster than you can
[0:59:08] <aubrea> ai was way better in fear
[0:59:14] <FuqBoiSlim> woolie's chasing these dudes done like Jason LUL
[0:59:15] <beatie_g> dude can you imagine pumping a guy full of SMG rounds but he keeps chasing you with a shotgun
[0:59:18] <+jiggy_snipe> lul
[0:59:18] <mMayrro> it's just like Fear's AI
[0:59:27] <PsychedelicSnake> the scripting for the grunts in HL1 was fucking nuts. They'd lay out traps and shit
[0:59:28] <%RioGascar> fear was like
[0:59:28] <natebud> I played HL source the other day and those marines are still terrifying
[0:59:31] <%RioGascar> 2006
[0:59:32] <Snorlax47> nom
[0:59:32] <NevikGamina> @beatie_g i would shit myself LUL
[0:59:32] <%Javaa01> Like games like CoD BARELY have functional AI, just a bunch of scripting to mask the lack of AI
[0:59:33] <GoDZooKii> I don't think I've ever seen someone be bad at a FPS. Pretty simple games.
[0:59:37] <beatie_g> oofie
[0:59:37] <mMayrro> ouchie ouch
[0:59:38] <@Solidus_113> your legs are brokenb
[0:59:40] <thesoothe> Seriously they even throw granades at this section in the original HL.
[0:59:45] <%RioGascar> for 1998 half life's AI was super impressive
[0:59:48] <FuqBoiSlim> oof ouch my legs
[1:00:01] <%linSP> Woolie’s more bullet than man
[1:00:04] <%RioGascar> even tho it could only do 1 move at a time
[1:00:07] <natebud> dark souls
[1:00:13] <+Okosisi89> My legs are OK
[1:00:26] <RushUnplugged> I remember thinking "Oh I'll hide behind this pillar and bounce a grenade off the wall" and seeing a grenade do the exact thing to me and kill me
[1:00:29] <%Gwimbles> Since the HEV suit automatically administers morphine when you're injured and shit, Gordon is basically wearing the god damned berserker armor
[1:00:46] <+Okosisi89> I gain Brouzouf
[1:00:47] <natebud> and he's high out of his mind
[1:00:48] <%Javaa01> Functional environments, in MY FPS game?
[1:00:53] <%Javaa01> More likely then you think
[1:00:56] <%RioGascar> i wonder if it also can administarer the stuff to not overdose on morphine
[1:00:58] <chronoxgp> HEV suit aint going to save you if you hit your head on a ceiling fan
[1:01:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> AND HE STILL SKIPPING CRATES
[1:01:08] <@Solidus_113> EYE is such a weird game
[1:01:11] <PsychedelicSnake> I remember running underneath one of those auto shop lifts later in the game and the grunts dropped that fucking thing on me.
[1:01:14] <natebud> Did those health packs not get picked up?
[1:01:16] <Snorlax47> But it has to run out of morphine at some point
[1:01:17] <emeraldskrull> he's doing it!!! woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[1:01:25] <%Javaa01> Too many to point out
[1:01:27] <%Javaa01> Even in this room
[1:01:36] <FuqBoiSlim> nyoom
[1:01:56] <+chiazam> No
[1:01:57] <andrei11dr> There's a lot of crates in this game
[1:01:58] <%Javaa01> Square crates
[1:02:12] <%freemoneymanforreal> freemoneymanforreal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak!
[1:02:14] <%Javaa01> Those low crates are just cover
[1:02:42] <%Gwimbles> @riogascar NARCAN is an opioid antagonist, so it'd temporarily stop an overdose, but it wouldn't stop him from fading bakc into an overdose if the NARCAN runs out and the morphine is still in him
[1:02:42] <Conky89> How hardcore would it be in real life if we opened crates like Gordon does with his crowbar?
[1:02:45] <+chiazam> Mmhmm
[1:02:49] <%RioGascar> almost got barnicled
[1:02:53] <%RioGascar> almost
[1:02:55] <natebud> That scientist is still alive LUL
[1:02:56] <%freemoneymanforreal> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:03:00] <andrei11dr> I remember crates havin shit in them more often
[1:03:00] <Snorlax47> That scientist was alive?
[1:03:02] <beatie_g> wait that science man is still kicking
[1:03:07] <%Gwimbles> Tho the suit monitors his blood and Shit so it probably administers the perfect amount for him to not be in pain and not overdose
[1:03:08] <beatie_g> how tf
[1:03:28] <natebud> Bad marine AI, takes them like 2 minutes to kill him if you wait. LUL
[1:03:48] <BlipJaw> why did that guy make me jump in my chair
[1:03:57] <thesoothe> Are they still based on the Combine AI?
[1:04:00] <beatie_g> he had a shotgun
[1:04:01] <%RioGascar> no
[1:04:02] <PsychedelicSnake> @WoolieVersus Don't be afraid to be a huge coward
[1:04:04] <G03933> "oh crap, he came back for me!" _marine
[1:04:06] <sileo_patronus> woolieFUN_LH
[1:04:09] <%RioGascar> they are imrpoved HECU ai
[1:04:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> Woolie not using the SMG is triggering me, lol.
[1:04:12] <Sundaysmiles01> delivious green goo
[1:04:12] <Snorlax47> Sweet sweet grub juice
[1:04:17] <%RioGascar> the combine dont voice their actions
[1:04:24] <natebud> @thesoothe yeah, they have that same waddling movement
[1:04:25] <%RioGascar> and also dont work in a squad
[1:04:33] <%RioGascar> at least i never got that sense
[1:04:36] <%Gwimbles> The combine totally voice stuff
[1:04:40] <%Gwimbles> You can't make it out but they do
[1:04:42] <UnfilteredComic> Its just garbled
[1:04:42] <natebud> @RioGascar yeah they kind of do, you just can't understand them
[1:04:43] <+kapcommunist> blowing my mind how he can ignore shields
[1:04:48] <%RioGascar> well fuck me
[1:04:51] <Snorlax47> they murmur stuff
[1:04:52] <%Gwimbles> They even have squad call signs and shot, it's super cool
[1:04:58] <%Gwimbles> *shit
[1:04:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:05:01] <%linSP> The combine have a lot of English dialogue that say what they’re doing
[1:05:06] <Dr_Mooose> break those crates
[1:05:14] <natebud> I'm pretty sure the combine use a lot of the gestures that the marines use too
[1:05:19] <%RioGascar> i know they say "thats a grenade" when one gets close to em
[1:05:23] <GoDZooKii> Never used 1-9 to switch I always use mouse wheel myself.
[1:05:28] <%Javaa01> No it's not, it's just the pause function
[1:05:31] <%Javaa01> Anyways, buttrock
[1:05:32] <natebud> yeah, but they don't run away from grenades any more either
[1:05:33] <%RioGascar> but i dont remember them saying "throwing nade" or something
[1:05:35] <%RioGascar> time for music
[1:05:37] <%linSP> *pick up that can* sorry whut
[1:05:40] <UnfilteredComic> is this the fuck you elevator
[1:05:41] <%Gwimbles> The combine will note the distance they're moving up and around I believe

[1:07:40] <Conky89> I don't care for the level design at points. I get the devs wanted to make Black Mesa look more realistic, but it leaves less options for tactics.

[1:09:39] <StarlitStunner> stripIQ the only real answer @d00msdaydan
[1:09:42] <Drakenstorm13> has the game become super fuckin loud for anuone else?
[1:09:45] <FuqBoiSlim> @d00msdaydan let's goooo
[1:09:46] <+chiazam> GO
[1:09:47] <Snorlax47> This is not a shotgun, this is a fucking anti-aircraft gun
[1:09:49] <%Gwimbles> Yeah game loud
[1:09:52] <+chiazam> MOVE
[1:09:55] <andrei11dr> Woolie still refuses to use his grenades
[1:09:56] <natebud> @Drakenstorm13 yeah the mixing is wonky
[1:10:00] <Zayasu> GAME WAY TOO LOUD
[1:10:03] <PsychedelicSnake> I remember the Black Mesa facility in HL1 being the first game I played giving me that sense of wanting to see more of the place before "the game" happens
[1:10:13] <%RioGascar> wait what
[1:10:13] <%Javaa01> So yeah, surface ain't a good idea
[1:10:14] <%Gwimbles> Grenades are for cowards, we goin' in with the shotgun
[1:10:21] <beatie_g> this is the way the game was meant to be experienced
[1:10:22] <%Javaa01> The game quiets down now
[1:10:26] <NevikGamina> game not loud enough Kappa
[1:10:26] <%Javaa01> That was the loud bit
[1:10:28] <+queaks> Game wasnt too loud but w/e
[1:10:28] <%RioGascar> perfect
[1:10:29] <%RioGascar> pacing
[1:10:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PsychedelicSnake tons of games copyed it because lots of players loved the exploring the world before it went to shit aspect
[1:10:42] <%Javaa01> So you adjusted the volume at the absolute wrong time
[1:10:45] <%RioGascar> you just got used to the HECU
[1:10:46] <natebud> Also adjust the music volume
[1:10:50] <+queaks> Game too quiet
[1:10:54] <%RioGascar> so heres a BIG action setpiece
[1:10:57] <%linSP> Valves games were great because they were thematic tech demos
[1:10:59] <RunningNGunning> Gordon is dummy thicc
[1:10:59] <@Squdnate> Way quiet now @WoolieVersus
[1:11:04] <%Javaa01> Power Armor aint light
[1:11:04] <Dr_Mooose> way too quiet now
[1:11:06] <+kapcommunist> El Gordo
[1:11:06] <@Solidus_113> HEVy
[1:11:11] <beatie_g> Gordon is 200 lbs of pure protien
[1:11:14] <Zeemod155> Can't spell heavy without HEV
[1:11:17] <rubbishbinge> SFX were fine, music was loud
[1:11:19] <%RioGascar> and then when the action set piece is done
[1:11:20] <+chiazam> Way too quiet now
[1:11:21] <Cykron> MY ASS IS HEAVY
[1:11:22] <%RioGascar> time to slow down
[1:11:28] <GoDZooKii> They already said though better netcode was what they are looking into for DBFZ, though. I see no reason they can't implement it.
[1:11:31] <aubrea> its still the source engine lol
[1:11:32] <%Javaa01> That's an EISA card
[1:11:32] <%RioGascar> the mixing is wierd and the music implementation is odd
[1:11:33] <PsychedelicSnake> action loud, otherwise sound will be fine. I'd say boost it back to where it was
[1:11:39] <natebud> Turn down music voume as a start
[1:11:45] <+queaks> Back to how it was. It wasnt too loud before
[1:11:50] <sileo_patronus> This isn't too quiet
[1:11:56] <prdrummer3> Sound is Great!
[1:12:04] <+FadingEmber> @WoolieVersus is there a music slider?

[1:12:21] <+queaks> Audio gag... wish I could hear it
[1:12:25] <%linSP> It’s fine
[1:12:39] <natebud> Voice volume is too quiet, but music volume is way to loud in this game.
[1:12:42] <+Rewrench> it wasnt too loud before. the music kicking in and sirens blaring was great before too
[1:12:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> What assholes
[1:12:49] <karl_rex> WTF MIlitary

[1:29:23] <thebehatted> isn't it just on their website?
[1:29:26] <+DesertPenguin> The Chernobyl Noise sounds like a great name for a band
[1:29:28] <FuqBoiSlim> hey guys. remember that time Randy Pitchford got the name "Gearbox" from a poker game with GabeN? LUL
[1:29:30] <PsychedelicSnake> Yeah, but at the same time the Valve setup makes it absurdly difficult to start a project
[1:29:31] <+Kiaayo> @itmegwimble he worked at microsoft at the time, and wanted to prove that windows was just as good for games as dos was
[1:29:31] <beatie_g> just do work 4Head

[1:29:42] <SomersaultJustice> wasn't that handbook just pr?
[1:29:52] <Prevot> this is why they don't make games anymore

[1:30:25] <fist_wizard_jay> People arent wearing enough hats
[1:30:30] <derap41> Only the BEST people
[1:30:36] <%RioGascar> the issue is to get any projects off the ground you need an EXECS interest

[1:45:42] <natebud> Turn on always run, hold the springt button to walk @WoolieVersus
[1:45:48] <paper1932> custom stuff
[1:45:48] <+YabbaTroll> they def used to have it
[1:45:50] <Haarute> walking worked on the original for this
[1:45:53] <+chiazam> Might’ve taken it out
[1:46:01] <+chvmpchange> bind it to a different button
[1:46:02] <cheesedburgers> Weird thing to take out
[1:46:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Woolie, not blind? Ha
[1:46:17] <+chvmpchange> bind it to a trigger dude
[1:46:18] <MutedMimic> LuL
[1:46:24] <paper1932> woolie may in fact have the ability to see
[1:46:25] <natebud> figure it out woolie
[1:46:27] <+zaibatsu_member_333> 100% its on my side of things
[1:46:32] <+Flunkorg> ITs not just speed woolie, you need to distract it with the bombs
[1:46:34] <cheesedburgers> Source’d
[1:46:36] <Haarute> think about why they gave you the remote explosive charge.
[1:46:43] <Solid_Stro> Woolie will figure it out... eventually.
[1:46:43] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Damn you Montral construction
[1:46:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @paper1932 Not quite convinced of that
[1:46:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE NEETS WILL INHERIT THE EARTH
[1:46:59] <rubbishbinge> explosives make sounds
[1:47:01] <+zaibatsu_member_333> *shakes fist at cloud*
[1:47:03] <evil_doru> distract it by throwing grenades at LOWER levels, then destroy woodboards
[1:47:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sonofthedeepsouth
[1:47:08] <bleugh> the keyboard woolie... use the keyboard
[1:47:09] <natebud> Don't just tell himt he answer
[1:47:10] <+chiazam> Man games were not intuitive back in the day
[1:47:16] <@Solidus_113> ladders only have one speed
[1:47:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> "Crouch on Ladder"
[1:47:26] <%Ecchigun> JUMP + CROUCH
[1:47:27] <+zaibatsu_member_333> What a Trill
[1:47:36] <Sundaysmiles01> Ladders make noise regardless of how fast you move
[1:47:36] <+chvmpchange> hmm perhaps the game was designed for a keyboard
[1:47:39] <%Ecchigun> coming back to neutral LUL
[1:47:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:47:42] <CrimsonSilver4> Actually on my playthrough the guard that comes up to shoot the monster glitched out and became invincible, even after firing the rocket
[1:47:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> just do a quater circle back dash woolie
[1:47:48] <@Solidus_113> It's a CFG file modification
[1:47:51] <+Flunkorg> @natebud You might enjoy watching someone do no progress for a few hours but most of us aren't
[1:47:51] <+gfbagel> Electric Wind Ladder Fist
[1:47:51] <@Solidus_113> I can send you a link
[1:47:57] <CrimsonSilver4> Made thigns easier for me
[1:48:01] <Haarute> woolie there's an easier gameplay solution than editing a cfg
[1:48:02] <natebud> Turn always run on, and hold the sprint button to walk @WoolieVersus
[1:48:13] <peachteagaming> auto crouch in the options menu
[1:48:31] <Sundaysmiles01> Woolie try throwing a grenade/satchel charge and see how long it holds its attention
[1:48:32] <+chiazam> It ain’t there
[1:48:33] <@Solidus_113> I sent it to Woolie on Twitter
[1:48:49] <Haarute> there's a reason for the game to give you explosives just now
[1:48:49] <+YabbaTroll> bind stick1 t_duck in console may work
[1:48:51] <evil_doru> distract it by throwing grenades at LOWER levels, then destroy woodboards
[1:48:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> really makes you think
[1:49:01] <+YabbaTroll> its either duck1 or t_duck
[1:49:07] <%linSP> source ladders woolieWUT
[1:49:18] <Dingo_Eejit> ???
[1:49:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> crouch
[1:49:21] <+Flunkorg> ???
[1:49:27] <+tuchpi> LUL
[1:49:34] <natebud> Woolie, there is an aspect of this encounter that you are missing entirely
[1:49:41] <Zooperton> jermaOneguy
[1:49:44] <+Flunkorg> Woolie, its about making noise
[1:49:45] <+kapcommunist> i said crip walking actually LUL
[1:49:45] <Sundaysmiles01> or throw the grenades at the wooden planks at the doorways to predestroy them, then just run distraction with other bombs
[1:49:47] <peachteagaming> we will remember this forever
[1:49:48] <Haarute> i remember walking working on the original, not sure if it works on this one ALSO there's a puzzle you aren't figuring out
[1:49:55] <+D00msDayDan> how is he reading everything in chat but the stuff about the demo charge
[1:49:56] <@Solidus_113> There was a bug before 1.0 where the crouch wasn't quiet enough, but I think it's fixed now
[1:49:58] <natebud> grenades make sound
[1:49:59] <+sir_louis> Other things can make sound
[1:50:02] <+tuchpi> they give you a shelf of explosives LUL
[1:50:05] <+Exyoh> You're on the right track with the crouching, but there's more to it
[1:50:13] <+Nod80> grenades use a lot of grenades
[1:50:18] <+chiazam> I mean the demo charge thing isn’t intuitive
[1:50:19] <MisterVantes> Just throw nades and sprint to the ladder @WoolieVersus
[1:50:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> You have grenades and demo satchels, which are quite loud
[1:50:26] <peachteagaming> distract with grenades
[1:50:28] <+chiazam> But that should work
[1:50:28] <%kyh9> Throw junk to make sounds
[1:50:30] <%linSP> You can sneak
[1:50:31] <NevikGamina> use grenades before goin down loadders
[1:50:31] <Haarute> @WoolieVersus they just gave you remote explosive charge. hint: it's not for damage.
[1:50:34] <Sundaysmiles01> IGNORE THE CROUCH, use the GRENADES
[1:50:35] <NevikGamina> *ladders

[1:50:49] <cheesedburgers> It’s not a very good encounter in the original unfortunately

[1:50:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Crouch tech is still optimal
[1:51:00] <+Nod80> blow the hell out of the boards
[1:51:00] <+kapcommunist> sick shirt!
[1:51:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie is a blood
[1:51:03] <+aishman> What section is this?
[1:51:05] <Dingo_Eejit> then do it, literally USE IT-uh
[1:51:06] <blaggablag> yeah you just nade and sprint
[1:51:07] <+YabbaTroll> "bind STICK1 toggle_duck" in the console should work @WoolieVersus
[1:51:14] <+aishman> Cause I'm half way past the game so I could help as well
[1:51:16] <kakdela7> is this about the tentacle monster?
[1:51:18] <+YabbaTroll> without a mod
[1:51:18] <@Solidus_113> This monster is still a sore spot in Half Life 1
[1:51:20] <oyyzzo> script it ^^
[1:51:20] <evil_doru> not an option, firepower ftw
[1:51:25] <+aishman> OH are we talking about the tentacles?
[1:51:26] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus I use grenades to open up the wooded barriers, then another grenade somewhere else to distract it
[1:51:27] <cheesedburgers> Couldn’t you force it into the hole for a few seconds
[1:51:30] <+That_Mojo> yeah, it's not a matter of woolie missing anything, he wants toggle crouch
[1:51:33] <cheesedburgers> Or am I misremembering
[1:51:39] <+That_Mojo> it's just that
[1:51:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB
[1:51:41] <@Solidus_113> It's a code change, not a steam workshop mod
[1:51:48] <natebud> @WoolieVersus if you turn on always run, the sprint button becomes 'walk', it's just as good as crouch and it's much more comfortable than holding the stick in
[1:51:48] <+chvmpchange> the game not having toggle crouch is bizarre
[1:51:50] <evil_doru> i remember u set it on fire
[1:51:55] <peachteagaming> woolie will now learn to use his pinkie
[1:51:56] <evil_doru> its been 12= years
[1:52:02] <+aishman> @cheesedburgers The way to go past it is crouching, using explosives like mines and grenades to distract it
[1:52:13] <+That_Mojo> it is weird if they removed an option for toggle crouch tbh
[1:52:35] <@Solidus_113> hacker time
[1:52:38] <+chvmpchange> i mean its a pretty standard fps feature
[1:52:40] <%Exiliator> Give Reggie a keyboard and have im press ctrl when you need to crouch Kappa

[1:56:49] <MassConnect> gordon takes a lot of damage

[1:57:12] <%eanscrale> The cake was in the game
[1:57:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> GLaDOS can eventually get bored of you
[1:57:15] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus The end of portal 2 takes place in the same world as half life just far in the future. Proves that the earth survives alien invasion
[1:57:17] <%RioGascar> Idk black mesa is dealing with lots of dangers
[1:57:18] <theKingRamses> what about all those people glados gassed
[1:57:30] <%RioGascar> portal gun is worthless without moon dust

[1:57:44] <heartlesshealer> Oh that's right, moon dust needed
[1:58:04] <worldbrand> you need to enable developer console in the options

[2:12:52] <@Solidus_113> they're different sections
[2:12:55] <+tuchpi> Kappa
[2:12:58] <@Solidus_113> you have to do both
[2:13:00] <natebud> grenade ark is a little weird in this game though. They're more accurate if you drop them, pick them up and throw them
[2:13:03] <NevikGamina> you have to do both LUL
[2:13:18] <Tuna_Can_0> @natebud LUL
[2:13:24] <Sundaysmiles01> Save?

[2:14:19] <xeros720> woolie is tuned for lean though

[2:15:08] <natebud> sometimes they do
[2:15:09] <@Solidus_113> sleepy bois
[2:15:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> Source was always a rather robust engine if a bit dated now days. but hopefuly source2 will be worth the wait

[2:15:39] <+The_Hand> razer chroma? i didnt know you were a pro gamer woolie LUL
[2:15:39] <GarbageNirvana> Ah yes, the Razer Chromafuck, I hear that's a popular one
[2:15:49] <@Solidus_113> grenade!
[2:15:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:16:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> @nothuzad yes but alex is the latest version with a proper SDK
[2:16:15] <natebud> if only you had some kind of handheld throwable explosive
[2:16:41] <NevikGamina> Kreygasm
[2:16:52] <dukenux> Woolie's determination to kill barnacles with melee impresses me
[2:17:55] <Solid_Stro> Up close and personal is Woolie’s style.
[2:18:10] <%RioGascar> gears of war
[2:18:11] <Dr_Mooose> gears
[2:18:12] <SubjectX07x> Active reload systems.
[2:18:13] <derap41> Yeah there are many games that have that
[2:18:13] <+Archphronimos> Gears of War yo
[2:18:17] <derap41> Far Cry 2
[2:18:19] <NevikGamina> LUL
[2:18:19] <dukenux> GoW has that perfect reload mechanic
[2:18:21] <+Archphronimos> that's their thing...
[2:18:24] <derap41> Killing Floor 2
[2:18:26] <+bokutachi_san> yes
[2:18:27] <+YabbaTroll> Tarkov but not like that
[2:18:27] <cheesedburgers> Fuckin far cry 2
[2:18:29] <@Solidus_113> there are a bunch of games where reloading a completely empty mag takes a bit longer than one with bullets still in it
[2:18:30] <NevikGamina> feed the barnacles
[2:18:31] <NevikGamina> LUL
[2:18:32] <@Solidus_113> also yes Reggie
[2:18:32] <dukenux> Fallout has "Faster reload" perk
[2:18:32] <+D00msDayDan> tons of games have a longer reload animation if you reload from empty vs some ammo left in the mag
[2:18:35] <%Exiliator> I always liked New Vegas reload fuck ups
[2:18:36] <CookieDoughFK> Black on the PS2 has 3 different reload types
[2:18:36] <+unclekulikov> I think medal of honor pacific had variable speed based on how far you were along on the campaign.
[2:18:37] <+kapcommunist> enter the gungeon has a speciial gun like that too
[2:18:52] <%RioGascar> its a gun that looks like the gears gun too
[2:18:55] <natebud> @kapcommunist And the upgrade is a literal Gear of War
[2:18:56] <dukenux> yep, that's GoW
[2:18:57] <derap41> Reloading with a bullet in the chamber vs reloading when empty is a big one
[2:18:58] <%RioGascar> has a chainsaw attachment too
[2:18:58] <NotHereToStream> active reload
[2:19:01] <SubjectX07x> There are also many games that operate off of the system where if you fully empty the gun it takes a little longer as you have to charge the charging handle, pump the shotty or rack the slide.
[2:19:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Mercenary Kings is all about that
[2:19:07] <dukenux> i relly liked that, more shooties should have that
[2:19:08] <NWannabe> ?? how old is unist?
[2:19:24] <Tuna_Can_0> gungeon has the passive that works for all guns
[2:19:27] <derap41> @SubjectX07x yeah exactly it makes a big diffirence
[2:19:30] <@Solidus_113> green button
[2:19:33] <NevikGamina> the button is right there BibleThump
[2:19:34] <Tuna_Can_0> unless were talking about RAD GUN
[2:19:35] <+sir_louis> I Love the reload!
[2:19:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> And Nioh's Ki Pulse is just an active reload on your Stamina
[2:19:37] <theZoePoundKilla> active reloads or something like that I lovethat shit too
[2:19:47] <FuqBoiSlim> Under night came out in 2012

[2:19:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Reload porn has been a thing for A WHILE woolie

[2:19:58] <%Ecchigun> @WoolieVersus Escape from tarkov have the sexiest reloads
[2:20:04] <%Ecchigun> trust me
[2:20:05] <%Ecchigun> i know

[2:20:17] <+D00msDayDan> @solid_stro poorly
[2:20:20] <derap41> Eouch
[2:20:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can you make that?
[2:20:28] <%Louie_Salmon> @solid_stro In his own way
[2:20:28] <SubjectX07x> Hell Escape From Tarkov has a difference in reloads where if you double tap R instead of taking out the mag, slipping it back into your vest then loading a fresh mag, your character just yeets the mag onto the floor and loads a new one. @derap41
[2:20:28] <natebud> Keep that in mind, Woolie. That is a thing later
[2:20:29] <NWannabe> Ok...is gun girl in UNIST newer thab gears @FuqBoiSlim ?
[2:20:35] <xeros720> the Woolie Story:"It Might've Been Cool"
[2:20:38] <heartlesshealer> dogs
[2:20:38] <%RioGascar> VR automatically has variable reload speed
[2:20:40] <%RioGascar> its fun
[2:20:45] <+YabbaTroll> @Ecchigun its counterbalanced by you fumbling on the floor looking for the 7ni that popped out of your mosin
[2:20:47] <%RioGascar> load a revolver under fire
[2:20:53] <%RioGascar> turns out its very hard
[2:20:53] <NotHereToStream> modern warfare has some nice reloads
[2:20:54] <heartlesshealer> event flags are fun
[2:21:08] <%Ecchigun> @YabbaTroll haha, true
[2:21:11] <+chiazam> The LP tax for platforming is MUCH STRONGER
[2:21:18] <derap41> RED9 reload is great

[2:42:17] <derap41> RearGuard is last
[2:42:17] <+lethallunacyx> That's based on each experience for me
[2:42:23] <dukenux> im still wiping my butt even if i get a bidet
[2:42:26] <+zaibatsu_member_333> FROME hOME dEPO EVEN..
[2:42:26] <Dingo_Eejit> America 140 roll per person per year - France 70

[2:42:30] <RushUnplugged> "fellas is it gay to wash yo ass" SMH
[2:42:31] <+lethallunacyx> sometimes it's 4 sometimes it's 20
[2:42:34] <dukenux> wet butthole doesnt sound fun
[2:42:43] <heartlesshealer> ignore progress
[2:42:44] <rysku> yeah but bidet takes more time
[2:42:48] <niddron> if you dip some water on it, that's special forces
[2:42:51] <@Solidus_113> down the elevator shaft
[2:42:54] <PsychedelicSnake> I trust my own shit. I don't trust bird shit
[2:43:00] <SomersaultJustice> so spit in the paper and wipe yourself, got it
[2:43:00] <heartlesshealer> GOODBYE PROGRESS
[2:43:01] <Elsewize> But like, you have to still wipe afterward, no?
[2:43:05] <%BinaryFireball> are there bidets in public toilets?
[2:43:09] <Sundaysmiles01> One up, One Down and One to Polish
[2:43:15] <+sadiebubs> yeah, just 1 wipe to dry off
[2:43:24] <@Solidus_113> there's platforms
[2:43:27] <natebud> @derap41 glock has a specific design to make it fire better and accurately underwater though.
[2:43:31] <NevikGamina> down into the shaft LUL
[2:43:32] <Dingo_Eejit> plus my asshole isn't on my face where people can see or smell it
[2:43:37] <Hegelundra> two big holes in the floor
[2:43:49] <dukenux> @Elsewize i always assumed so. unless people use bidets like they use Karcher devices. make the sheer water pressure wipe it all clean
[2:43:49] <+D00msDayDan> woolie's arch nemesis, ladders
[2:43:50] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Dry wipe 1st then follow up with soap an water wipes VoHiYo

[2:44:16] <derap41> @natebud Sure but most pistols can already do that so having it specifically made to do that what's the point
[2:44:19] <dukenux> Wa'ah

[2:46:47] <PsychedelicSnake> The Mist is raw
[2:46:48] <derap41> Also MP5 with a grenade launcher I mean its cool but good luck using that in reality
[2:46:49] <@Solidus_113> You'll want to save a couple times in this room
[2:46:52] <Dr_Mooose> bad times the movie
[2:46:58] <+zaibatsu_member_333> She blinded me with Science!
[2:47:07] <%RioGascar> marc laidlaw is VERY inspired by dark shit
[2:47:12] <dukenux> Also: Die Hard
[2:47:24] <Solid_Stro> Bad ending the movie
[2:47:29] <%RioGascar> see: half life 2's beta
[2:47:31] <peachy996> Outer Limits had a great intro
[2:47:34] <%RioGascar> where it was too dark
[2:47:49] <heartlesshealer> So Reggie, about The Borderland?
[2:47:50] <Tuna_Can_0> Marc Laidlaw is the shit, god Valve could have done some great stuff
[2:47:51] <Zooperton> hl2's beta was rad
[2:48:11] <dukenux> HL2 changed "dark" to "bleak"
[2:48:13] <%RioGascar> marc came back for consulting on alyx
[2:48:18] <dukenux> until Ravenholm at least
[2:48:28] <%RioGascar> also it was written by the portal 2 team
[2:48:35] <%RioGascar> so i have high hopes for its story
[2:48:48] <natebud> door stuck
[2:48:57] <Dingo_Eejit> Come again?
[2:49:04] <Solid_Stro> Eventually Woolie’s FPS will lead him to screaming at 12 year olds for noob tubing. We’ll get there.
[2:49:15] <Tuna_Can_0> @RioGascar oh thats cool, I figured he had a bad experience with Valve when he left
[2:49:22] <@Solidus_113> you want to go back down
[2:49:28] <%RioGascar> they addressed that in the AMA
[2:49:35] <%RioGascar> he and valve left on good terms
[2:49:42] <derap41> Chirality broken
[2:49:46] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Regies sppoky
[2:49:49] <Tuna_Can_0> Ill have to look at that
[2:49:52] <derap41> Kojima You hack
[2:49:52] <+zaibatsu_member_333> :o
[2:49:56] <+zaibatsu_member_333> :0
[2:50:08] <%Exiliator> If I wanted to go to another dimension, I would just pick a fight with Vegeta or something
[2:50:21] <@Solidus_113> there's a puzzle here
[2:50:34] <@Solidus_113> SAVE NOW
[2:50:43] <%linSP> you look away from the mirror but your reflection continues to stare at you
[2:50:46] <%RioGascar> it auto saves i believe solid
[2:50:48] <heartlesshealer> SAVE
[2:50:51] <dukenux> And Die Hard
[2:50:51] <lotharrio> Outer Limits had a lot of morals tacked onto the end of their neat sci fi stories.

[3:12:34] <Elsewize> "I heard you was talkin' crap ovah heyah."
[3:12:35] <derap41> take a good look at these guys
[3:12:42] <@Solidus_113> you want headshots
[3:12:43] <fangovafang> 😳
[3:12:44] <PsychedelicSnake> Why is the magnum so weak
[3:12:45] <+Mr_Pylon> headshotter
[3:12:46] <+Freeborg1997> Sure...
[3:12:47] <+jepupu> It's a sniper
[3:12:50] <natebud> takes two like the shotgun.
[3:12:52] <HorribleHog> you want to *hit* them
[3:12:52] <%RioGascar> headshot is insta kill
[3:12:54] <%Javaa01> Revolver is for headshots
[3:13:00] <Them00n> It seems weaker than I remember.
[3:13:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Ether101_Prime Doomslayer doesn't care unless its a demon
[3:13:02] <Kraahka> You need to actually aim
[3:13:04] <+aishman> It's great...for a headshot
[3:13:04] <Quent0nius> this has "Doomslayer needed" all over it
[3:13:10] <%chiluzza> headshot is insta killl
[3:13:11] <UnfilteredComic> Magnum is stronger in HL2
[3:13:12] <ripoffproductionsllc> 1 for headshot, 2 for normal
[3:13:12] <%linSP> Gotta high noon
[3:13:15] <dukenux> did they nerf Magnum? that'd suck
[3:13:16] <Solid_Stro> Head.... shot...
[3:13:16] <NevikGamina> yaeh you gotta headshot
[3:13:20] <Djinnazz> You missed a lot of those
[3:13:22] <derap41> Insta GIB or nothing in Source games
[3:13:24] <+chiazam> Headshot
[3:13:26] <MattDemers> HL2 headshot is great
[3:13:27] <MileenaTheOni> It's not a hand-cannon.
[3:13:29] <%Javaa01> The revolver is perfectly accurate, and it's for headshots ONLY
[3:13:30] <Kraahka> It's still a two shot for most enemies
[3:13:32] <MattDemers> Er HL 2 Magnum is great
[3:13:32] <Zeemod155> They're all hitscan
[3:13:40] <Cykron> You need to headshot with the magnum
[3:13:41] <NevikGamina> stars? i'll show you stars LUL
[3:13:46] <ripoffproductionsllc> there was a room up above the l;ader
[3:13:48] <@Solidus_113> rocket is the only projectile
[3:13:51] <%RioGascar> okay so woolie go back
[3:13:56] <Haarute> diference is that this is a first person shooter, you gotta aim.
[3:14:00] <dukenux> you don't want to waste magnum ammo on headcrabs anyway
[3:14:01] <%RioGascar> you kinda need to go back to progress
[3:14:07] <derap41> Woolie Look at the Vorts

[3:17:28] <heartlesshealer> turrets were pre-soldier invasion
[3:17:28] <UnfilteredComic> they do, thats why it doesnt shoot them
[3:17:33] <ripoffproductionsllc> no, they were military
[3:17:34] <+FanServ> there are facility turrets but also soldier turrets
[3:17:36] <Solid_Stro> Their eyesight is based on movement
[3:17:37] <derap41> Sourced
[3:17:37] <jackoftheflames> @WoolieVersus That turret was theirs, hence why it didn't shoot them

[3:17:55] <Ahk_90> physics doing their bullshit
[3:17:56] <%RioGascar> the facility ones are black mesa

[3:18:03] <natebud> @UnfilteredComic they have a lot of trouble, it's crazy
[3:18:06] <derap41> @valachi Why Would They have armed guards
[3:18:11] <UnfilteredComic> Use hotkeys 1-9
[3:18:11] <jackoftheflames> Try lift up a turret next time
[3:18:19] <HorribleHog> the fact that there are facility turrets but only in that one section bothers me
[3:18:23] <jackoftheflames> and put it towards the soldiers. fun time
[3:18:23] <valachi> @derap41 To make those fucking NERDS know their place
[3:18:24] <Them00n> We're not even close to done with weapons either.
[3:18:25] <+BNPhone> They should really have HL2 Console Weapon Wheel
[3:18:30] <dukenux> is there a "Q" key equivalent on a gamepad?
[3:18:39] <natebud> Woolie still has about 5 more weapons to acquire, The weapon switching will be glorious

[3:27:39] <Zeemod155> I encourage using the walls the bank-shot your grenade throws
[3:27:39] <natebud> He always loads an extra shell with the reload animation
[3:28:14] <%RioGascar> HEV is what keeps gordon alive

[3:42:34] <ripoffproductionsllc> save
[3:42:34] <lotharrio> X
[3:42:38] <Djinnazz> The orange demon
[3:42:41] <natebud> they blew themselves up probably
[3:42:51] <Dr_Mooose> *gordon
[3:43:03] <bleugh> just use a mouse...
[3:43:03] <zenith0111> Woolie plz
[3:43:08] <natebud> for christ sake just stand still woolie
[3:43:09] <Doomstar16> Holy poop that dude litterally exploded
[3:43:11] <ripoffproductionsllc> perfect grenade, horrible shotgun
[3:43:14] <derap41> How many humans have Gordon Killed by now
[3:43:19] <%Exiliator> flanking!
[3:43:27] <+BNPhone> ehh like 50 or so
[3:43:41] <lotharrio> Gordon Freeman has been killing since he was in highschool.
[3:43:41] <+BNPhone> give or take
[3:43:43] <gade177> Woolie get's motion sickness and yet he moves so much.
[3:43:44] <Zeemod155> RIP ranged weapons
[3:43:55] <natebud> like 35
[3:43:59] <derap41> Murder Man Gordon
[3:44:06] <%RioGascar> he gets a specfic type of motion sickness
[3:44:11] <+jepupu> Shotgun is the best weapon on controller, since lots of others take preceision aim
[3:44:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> an MIT bookworm has managed to kill at least 40 elite trained soldiers
[3:44:14] <%Exiliator> The DOOM has imprinted itself too hard into Woolie
[3:44:18] <Haarute> Gordon the Berserker
[3:44:26] <dukenux> wooliePsycho
[3:44:30] <DedlokPM> Wait... This whole Jack in a box thing just made me realize something... Metal Gear Solid 3... They said Big Boss's "name" is Jack. And what is a common thing that you can hide in the metal gear games? A BOX
[3:44:34] <natebud> you are wrong
[3:44:34] <fangovafang> 🎶weee reeaaddy🎶
[3:44:37] <Djinnazz> Kinda??
[3:44:37] <derap41> He likes the Gibblets
[3:44:40] <+tuchpi> dont you get controller aim assist?
[3:44:41] <DedlokPM> SO BIG BOSS IS A JACK IN A BOX
[3:44:46] <+PapermanXD> grappler route
[3:44:47] <%linSP> Gordon played too much doom
[3:44:50] <unit24> yeah woolie needs to mess with the sensitivity
[3:44:51] <%RioGascar> @DedlokPM you are in time out now
[3:44:53] <%RioGascar> bad
[3:44:58] <+PapermanXD> gotta get in there
[3:45:00] <unit24> the acceleration on source games is pure garbage
[3:45:06] <unit24> first it moves too slow, then it moves too fast
[3:45:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DedlokPM That makes Metal gear....So much better
[3:45:16] <%RioGascar> does it
[3:45:19] <yeeyeyee> isn't big boss's name john
[3:45:21] <Dr_Mooose> yes
[3:45:24] <DedlokPM> It does
[3:45:25] <%RioGascar> cause thats just kojimas PUN GAME AGAIN
[3:45:29] <natebud> i think its off by default @unit24
[3:45:39] <+BNPhone> Every fuckin' console shooter either has shit low sens or shit ass acceleration I can't stand it
[3:45:49] <%linSP> Jack was raiden wasn’t he
[3:45:54] <yeeyeyee> big boss is john, raiden is jack, and solid snake is david
[3:45:56] <ripoffproductionsllc> there was a room you missed backby the ladder by "Big BIO"
[3:45:57] <+PapermanXD> tasty rads
[3:45:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> @linSP yes he is
[3:46:05] <+Freeborg1997> Help?
[3:46:09] <Sundaysmiles01> Is woolie using a controller or keyboard and mouse for this playthrough?
[3:46:11] <natebud> Woolie never even talked to the tram guy
[3:46:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> Thats Rad
[3:46:14] <unit24> what I mean is that woolie's aim starts slow and then immediately speeds up when he moves the stick, it's how it was on the console versions of orange box as well
[3:46:17] <zenith0111> My favorite Kojima pun is Jack the Ripper because it meant he killed people caleb63
[3:46:18] <+BNPhone> Controller
[3:46:24] <Sundaysmiles01> ....ah
[3:46:25] <+aceleapc> everyone knows when you're exposed to radiation you see film grain
[3:46:26] <derap41> @Sundaysmiles01 Controller like a mad man
[3:46:30] <Sundaysmiles01> I see why his aim sucks
[3:46:38] <DedlokPM> @linSP I double checked by googling before hand. Jack is both Big Boss' AND Raiden's "Name"
[3:46:48] <natebud> just stand still and shoot
[3:46:49] <+BNPhone> next time I won't miss
[3:46:55] <Kraahka> It is a controller, hence the clumsy aim
[3:46:58] <%Javaa01> Well thankfully there is health around
[3:47:02] <Dingo_Eejit> @xx123manxx - Titanfall2 bro, they cared about stick sens/acc
[3:47:03] <derap41> That guy was so proud that he hit you too
[3:47:03] <%Javaa01> In the control room
[3:47:08] <ripoffproductionsllc> medic soldiers sometimes drop med-kits
[3:47:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[3:47:08] <%Exiliator> You could paste the doom soundtrack onto this gameplay LUL
[3:47:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> time to turn on the power
[3:47:25] <derap41> What a loser marine getting headcrabbed
[3:47:45] <%RioGascar> so you can open that door up on the ladder
[3:47:49] <ToneBacas> imagine if they made aiming a system-wide thing as opposed to per-game thing. you'd always have the same aiming experience across games
[3:48:06] <derap41> @ToneBacas That would be a nightmare
[3:48:09] <natebud> You used to get 10 mp5 grenades in reserve
[3:48:12] <ripoffproductionsllc> door
[3:48:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> turn around
[3:48:14] <%Javaa01> GO IN THAT ROOM
[3:48:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> DOOOR
[3:48:18] <natebud> open the door
[3:48:19] <+queaks> Why is he ignoring that door?
[3:48:20] <shamuzu> NotLikeThis
[3:48:23] <ripoffproductionsllc> ajar door
[3:48:24] <+Freeborg1997> You passed it
[3:48:28] <Dr_Mooose> we laugh cause we know the pain
[3:48:32] <derap41> Why that ladder
[3:48:33] <@Solidus_113> back at the ladder
[3:48:35] <%Javaa01> NEXT TO LADDER

[3:48:50] <ToneBacas> it's ya boy flame hands
[3:48:57] <%RioGascar> oh hey missed that scene

[3:49:06] <natebud> wheres the guy
[3:49:12] <%RioGascar> uh
[3:49:15] <%RioGascar> did guard not spawn?
[3:49:16] <Haarute> he sequence broke it probably lmao
[3:49:20] <%Javaa01> Yeah, no Barney because he skipped coming to here before fixing the power
[3:49:20] <shamuzu> uh oh...
[3:49:21] <%RioGascar> uh oh
[3:49:24] <ripoffproductionsllc> oh no...
[3:49:25] <+BNPhone> he just... doesn't exist if you miss him the 1st time?
[3:49:27] <%RioGascar> he might be unable to complete now
[3:49:27] <dukenux> wait, where's the guy?
[3:49:33] <natebud> Big sequence break
[3:49:42] <dukenux> oh nooooo
[3:49:46] <%Exiliator> Maybe hes friendly :)
[3:49:47] <%RioGascar> might
[3:49:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> @xx123manxx yeeeeap
[3:49:48] <derap41> Eh this might be ba
[3:49:49] <ripoffproductionsllc> did iot brake becouse he didn't see him before starting the power?
[3:49:50] <derap41> d
[3:49:51] <Dr_Mooose> uh ok
[3:49:51] <unit24> did the chapter break?
[3:49:54] <Haarute> i'd assume he can do it, he just doesn't know -what- to do
[3:49:55] <%Javaa01> @dukenux Barney doesn't show up unless you come here before fixing the power
[3:49:58] <natebud> There was a guy to talk to in here before
[3:49:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytALRIGHT
[3:50:03] <ripoffproductionsllc> does he need tio restart the chapter?
[3:50:10] <%RioGascar> i dont think so
[3:50:11] <@Solidus_113> he didn't come in here the first time before power
[3:50:16] <natebud> The walkway never fell too
[3:50:17] <dukenux> @Javaa01 that's weird, but atleast the lp isn't broken
[3:50:23] <%RioGascar> he might be screwed
[3:50:29] <+BNPhone> FIYAHH
[3:50:31] <%RioGascar> since the guard activates the switch
[3:50:33] <%Exiliator> ouch
[3:50:39] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus apparently the lps not broken yet, you trigger the thing later
[3:50:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[3:50:41] <AppleBerryKitty> F
[3:50:42] <NotHereToStream> ass completely cooked
[3:50:42] <Zeemod155> WHY?
[3:50:43] <%Javaa01> @dukenux It worked like this in HL1 original as well
[3:50:47] <+BionoidLCR> yea run in that corner woolz
[3:50:47] <@Solidus_113> you were going the right way
[3:50:47] <natebud> I hope he appears to operate the turnstyle
[3:50:48] <Haarute> second try
[3:50:49] <fangovafang> ...
[3:50:50] <UnfilteredComic> YOu wanted that ladder
[3:50:51] <%RioGascar> looking up it doesnt seem broken
[3:50:53] <+KingOfTheSpaceWasp> what the hell woolie
[3:50:55] <RiverBirch> LOWER YOUR SHIELD
[3:50:56] <%aRealBaboon> lmao this is the one that always gets new players @WoolieVersus
[3:50:56] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> slizzed
[3:50:57] <PsychedelicSnake> It's fine
[3:50:58] <UnfilteredComic> Nah youre good
[3:51:02] <Haarute> i'm pretty sure he can do it
[3:51:03] <derap41> There is meant to be a guy in this room
[3:51:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> you just missed a character nothing more
[3:51:09] <derap41> Might still worjk
[3:51:10] <PsychedelicSnake> You just missed a character. It's fine
[3:51:11] <+tuchpi> Kappa
[3:51:12] <ripoffproductionsllc> no that guy is in BM
[3:51:13] <+Freeborg1997> No the guard was just an optional conversation, it doesn't effect the story.
[3:51:14] <%Javaa01> Nope, the scene is in Black Mesa as well
[3:51:18] <%Javaa01> But you skipped it
[3:51:18] <@Solidus_113> It's a small detail, nothing broken
[3:51:25] <natebud> That guy is in black mesa, he never spawned
[3:51:26] <+BNPhone> BHOP on controller Kappa
[3:51:32] <%RioGascar> the reason we said is cause the guard DIES in this and the game DOES trigger a fail state
[3:51:41] <Dr_Mooose> just like a dog
[3:51:44] <%Javaa01> You need to fix the power tho
[3:51:49] <+BionoidLCR> fix the power woolz

[3:55:34] <%RioGascar> back up top
[3:55:48] <%RioGascar> the guard is supposed to rotate it for you

[3:55:49] <UnfilteredComic> It already did it
[3:55:49] <dukenux> Control room
[3:55:52] <+Freeborg1997> Oh, I think this is where the guy was supposed to turn it.
[3:55:53] <dukenux> oh neat

[3:56:32] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:56:36] <%RioGascar> you can sitll kill him tho
[3:56:45] <%RioGascar> and if you do game over triggers
[3:56:53] <%RioGascar> it just takes like 18 magnum shots
[3:56:59] <derap41> Rocket man Gordon
[3:57:00] <ToneBacas> did this guy hear any of the fighting with the big dude?
[3:57:06] <Sundaysmiles01> or twenty grenades

[3:58:43] <%Javaa01> It drowned
[3:58:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> jack in the box was better
[3:58:46] <derap41> That's not how Half Life works

[3:59:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Oncamimus
[3:59:12] <mMayrro> this chapter SUCKS in the original
[3:59:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Dr_Mooose ..............
[3:59:18] <natebud> It's just a straight line now
[3:59:19] <Sundaysmiles01> oh shit... 666 viewers
[3:59:20] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this is the most dramatic adjustments in Black Mesa
[3:59:22] <%Exiliator> John freeman got his computer shut down
[3:59:25] <@Solidus_113> hail
[3:59:25] <unit24> on a rail uncut is the shit and I am so disappointed they didn't officially incorporate it
[3:59:26] <dukenux> the og "On a rail" was kind of a slog
[3:59:30] <Dr_Mooose> @doc_ock_rokc bars
[3:59:31] <arkv01> these vibes Kreygasm
[3:59:31] <Zeemod155> DEVIL VIEWERS
[3:59:33] <lotharrio> Woolie! you got them devil viewers right now!
[3:59:36] <Zooperton> 666 viewers and woolie ain't playing doom :(
[3:59:37] <+BNPhone> I always take the fastest route thru On a Rail every time
[3:59:39] <AppleBerryKitty> chat! steam version have the uncut unarail?
[3:59:41] <+Freeborg1997> @Javaa01 But Xen though...
[3:59:42] <%Exiliator> DEVIL STREAM
[3:59:42] <%Javaa01> This On a Rail has nearly nothing to do with the original On a Rail
[3:59:46] <dukenux> or so they say, i didn't hate it personally
[3:59:46] <DedlokPM> @BionoidLCR 1) you had not said that when I started typing it 2) you must make a lot of friends with an attitude like that
[3:59:52] <%RioGascar> you can download the original version
[3:59:53] <ripoffproductionsllc> saddly shortening OAR gives the soldiers less waight due to having less fights with them
[4:00:00] <%RioGascar> which is made by a black mesa dev
[4:00:00] <natebud> I like original On A Rail. The hate it gets is exagerrated
[4:00:01] <derap41> I'm On a rail
[4:00:03] <%Javaa01> Xen isn't an adjustment, Xen is a completely new thing
[4:00:08] <+queaks> Those reflections are strangely impressive
[4:00:13] <derap41> Everybody look at me cause I'm standing on a rail
[4:00:15] <natebud> Xen has TREES now
[4:00:17] <dellis80> Doom is good....but overrated
[4:00:17] <%Exiliator> Woolie has been streaming for: PIE!
[4:00:18] <Them00n> On a Rail kinda sucks, we can all admit that right?
[4:00:26] <+BNPhone> !motivated
[4:00:26] <@Moobot> 728 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:00:28] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[4:00:28] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 13 minutes
[4:00:29] <FuqBoiSlim> this water is okay looking. we need the water rater from Miiverse to give us the accurate rating tho
[4:00:33] <natebud> @Them00n nah
[4:00:33] <derap41> Big cracks
[4:00:37] <%Javaa01> The original On a Rail maze isn't great
[4:00:38] <ripoffproductionsllc> we done or just a brake?
[4:00:41] <zamzoph> BELLY
[4:00:42] <+BionoidLCR> @DedlokPM if you read the message at all you would see that i did i said def wise they called them all barney but a theres one whos name is so get bent
[4:00:44] <@Solidus_113> big progress
[4:00:44] <%linSP> Shoot I have to now play this and the original just so I can listen to both scores
[4:00:55] <%Javaa01> But yeah, you're now coming up on the halfway point of Black Mesa
[4:01:00] <+imadoc91> Yo, did I come in at the beginning or at the end?
[4:01:01] <%RioGascar> i like kelly bailey's score a lot
[4:01:02] <%Javaa01> Not quite there YET, but after this
[4:01:04] <+Freeborg1997> Make sure Woolie gets MMod for Half-Life 2, it updates the graphics to look more like this.
[4:01:07] <natebud> @Javaa01 It's not much of a maze, just a loop
[4:01:11] <+BionoidLCR> big mesa
[4:01:17] <+BionoidLCR> yes LUL
[4:01:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:01:17] <%RioGascar> but joel nealson black mesa score is pretty good to
[4:01:18] <%linSP> Hi woolie woolieF woolieF_HF
[4:01:19] <%Exiliator> yes
[4:01:19] <%generalve> no
[4:01:26] <natebud> woolie just stand still and shoot.
[4:01:29] <Tuna_Can_0> its fine :)
[4:01:32] <peachy996> I've made my peace with your aim
[4:01:37] <+BNPhone> There's one Music Track in DMC1 that uses the same sample as Half-Life 1 and it weirds me out every time I hear it
[4:01:43] <natebud> this a shotgun stream now
[4:01:49] <derap41> @natebud its easier to move and aim with a controller
[4:01:54] <Sundaysmiles01> The Shotgun Scientist
[4:01:54] <%RioGascar> the lore hole is DARK
[4:02:00] <NWannabe> woolieLORE
[4:02:01] <derap41> Yeah save it for 2
[4:02:02] <%Exiliator> yes
[4:02:04] <pixel_river> true
[4:02:04] <@Solidus_113> HL2 is a nightmare
[4:02:04] <%Javaa01> Half Life 1 is the kickoff
[4:02:09] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Everything with the combine is BIG body horror
[4:02:09] <Dr_Mooose> yeah shits pretty rough
[4:02:10] <%RioGascar> the BETA for half life 2 IS SO DARK
[4:02:10] <lotharrio> You'll start to feel it at the end of HL1.
[4:02:12] <%Javaa01> Half Life 2 is the start of the endgame
[4:02:15] <ripoffproductionsllc> I've never seen pysics do shit like what that cjhair did
[4:02:18] <Tuna_Can_0> Woolie in HL2 PogChamp
[4:02:19] <Sundaysmiles01> I can't believe you're using a controller you mad lad
[4:02:22] <+Freeborg1997> There's hidden easter eggs and conversations that expand the lore
[4:02:22] <natebud> @derap41 I know but the AI aim is so bad that you're usually strafing into shots that usually miss.
[4:02:24] <%Exiliator> Dont look up stuff before playing 2
[4:02:34] <%chiluzza> Half life is the pass for the Half Life 2 SLAM DUNK
[4:02:40] <derap41> Lore is all Scientist nerds
[4:02:41] <@Solidus_113> All the Black Mesa lore is around you at all times
[4:02:41] <zamzoph> audiologs
[4:02:44] <%Javaa01> Half Life story telling is in the environment
[4:02:44] <%linSP> 2 is bleak times
[4:02:46] <@Solidus_113> it's in the atmosphere
[4:02:51] <%RioGascar> you do hear dialgoue from scientists and hecu marines
[4:02:51] <DedlokPM> @BionoidLCR The message I replied to was "dev name not character name." If you learned to type your full message in 1 go instead of breaking it into multiple parts we would be avoiding this. Then again this exchange sure shows your shitty attitude to people pointing out minor foibles to what you said in full blast
[4:02:53] <ripoffproductionsllc> it's world biulding, visual/enviroment shit
[4:02:55] <%Javaa01> Not explicit item descriptions or other bullshit
[4:02:56] <%RioGascar> but its ALL implications
[4:03:02] <zamzoph> the lore in HL1 is meatgags
[4:03:05] <worldbrand> imagine if HL had soulsborne bloodstains
[4:03:10] <%RioGascar> dope
[4:03:19] <derap41> Its not as Good as 1 fight me
[4:03:21] <+Freeborg1997> Going to play the Half-Life 2 episodes?
[4:03:23] <+BionoidLCR> @DedlokPM thats not what it said dipshit go fuckign complain somewhere else
[4:03:24] <%Exiliator> Woolie woolieVS Half-life 2!
[4:03:31] <lotharrio> Half Life 2 is a game that secretly changes genres every few hours.
[4:03:37] <%linSP> No spoil the lore
[4:03:39] <+BNPhone> All Half-Life games are/were free on steam For Half-Life Alyx but IDK how long that's going on for
[4:03:41] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Whens Opposing Force remake tho?
[4:03:44] <%RioGascar> so does half life 1
[4:03:53] <+BionoidLCR> i cant get behind okami but it sure is pretty
[4:03:59] <%RioGascar> it changes the genre from horror to action back to horror and then ALL ACTION
[4:04:13] <Drakenstorm13> I've always found that half life innovated so much an was so influential that by the time i had played it it was just like everything else i ever played
[4:04:14] <arkv01> "can't wait for reggie to **** it"
[4:04:18] <%Exiliator> LUL
[4:04:18] <%RioGascar> all half life is free until alyx is out
[4:04:20] <%MintMuffinGamer> So how is everyone holding up.
[4:04:24] <%Javaa01> Just Inception the LP into existence
[4:04:24] <%RioGascar> so march 23rd
[4:04:25] <FuqBoiSlim> Okami part 108: finally getting to the haunted ship
[4:04:29] <SomersaultJustice> looking forward to that Earthbound LP!
[4:04:32] <worldbrand> cant wait for woolie playing Seaman 2 for the PS2 in japanese
[4:04:45] <%Exiliator> Lemme just book you into this thing ok? yeah ok good.
[4:04:50] <+kapcommunist> Hillary Clinton bot lol
[4:04:52] <Dr_Mooose> it's official PogChamp
[4:04:52] <+future_ry> someone just recorded that
[4:04:52] <FuqBoiSlim> YO HE SAID IT
[4:04:53] <%Tearonex> HALF LIFE ALEX CONFIRMED
[4:04:57] <peachy996> FIGHTING GAMES
[4:04:59] <shamuzu> PogChamp HE SAID IT
[4:04:59] <%linSP> Deepest lp fakes
[4:05:02] <+YabbaTroll> HE SAID IT
[4:05:03] <FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOO WOOLIE VS VR
[4:05:04] <arkv01> YOU SAY THIS but we are DEEP LEARNING your voice as you speak
[4:05:08] <Oncamimus> omg yes
[4:05:14] <rubbishbinge> We have enough sound clips for it
[4:05:36] <Oncamimus> yeah like...years worth
[4:05:40] <@Solidus_113> I can't believe Woolie beat that boss without healing items
[4:05:41] <worldbrand> actually those AI networks for replicating voices are getting really sophisticated, to the point where the people developing them are trying to collectively keep the algorithms from public knowledge
[4:05:42] <lotharrio> Woolie's too smart to play Half Life 2, right after he finishes Half Life.
[4:05:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "You're QUITE good AT turning ME on"
[4:05:47] <%RioGascar> i do hope you are enjoying half life/black mesa
