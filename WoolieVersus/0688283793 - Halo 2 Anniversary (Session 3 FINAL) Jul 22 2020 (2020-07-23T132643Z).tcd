[0:12:28] <jorniev> my class is unnenployed
[0:12:32] <DesertPenguin> Metallica started that with their S&M concert right?
[0:12:33] <drewslo> I'm 24 and already starting to grey but at least no bald
[0:12:41] <gamewarden92> Today, we proceed with the fight.
[0:12:41] <%RioGascar> Metallica always started with it
[0:12:45] <%DensityD> psaBig Strong
[0:12:46] <%kyh9> What are they talking about?
[0:12:46] <TheChucklingOak> I'm 22 and nearly completely bald
[0:12:48] <IndoorSitup> *whistling and native chanting intensifies*
[0:12:49] <dadeaner> it hits you
[0:12:49] <Ashenik1> Whiplash the movie made me sweat so much beacue of the tension
[0:12:50] <DesertPenguin> I'm 32 and started balding/thinning drastically at 26
[0:12:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Once Upon a Time in the West is my all time favorite western
[0:12:56] <Captain_sevatar> @huskarl_zap It does and Gelt is probably one of my favorite characters in the setting
[0:12:58] <%RioGascar> good the bad and the ugly the finale
[0:13:12] <+wunp_fxs> halo in context tho is amazing
[0:13:12] <%kyh9> Gotcha
[0:13:20] <%LavenderLaser> F’s in the chat for ennio morricone
[0:13:24] <%threeheadedwalrus> Halo Infinite gameplay tomorrow lads?

[0:13:25] <+OblivionSword1> !uptime
[0:13:26] <derap41> RIp
[0:13:26] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 23 minutes and 33 seconds
[0:13:26] <%Intersceptre> end of H3 is the ultra for the theme music
[0:13:27] <jamesthebrave> Difference between rando hearing an anime OP on YT and then actually seeing it in the series
[0:13:28] <+BigBlackBankai> F
[0:13:29] <%RioGascar> You also get the scale of that scene SINCE THAT IS NOT CGI OR ANYTHING
[0:13:30] <Ashenik1> Woolie imgaine how much you would love the witche musci after playing the games Geralt'theme man....
[0:13:32] <BritishTyrannosaur> Anyone see the new Halo infinite art? very CE boxart inspired
[0:13:36] <%krispen_wa> The epic halo music while woolie fails at driving is some amazing context
[0:13:37] <huskarl_zap> @captain_sevatar I just love The Lore of Metal name and concept.
[0:13:38] <%Papa_Bearman> I'm not much into Westerns, but mine is 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence'.
[0:13:38] <Dean_Inbetween> Context makes the music in halo even tho the music is great on its own
[0:13:39] <+thesw1tch> wanananana... wah wuh wahhh
[0:13:39] <%RioGascar> those actors are really there sweating their asses off
[0:13:41] <R3c0n31> Good music does a lot for action games
[0:13:41] <$QueequegTheater> WE ARE ODST
[0:13:44] <brachydios777> Red dead 1 and 2’s story is a really solid wild west story
[0:13:47] <TheChucklingOak> The "Warthog run" is a better ending concept than most video game bossfights, imo
[0:13:47] <%Slimshazbot> Risk of Rain 1 and 2 has GREAT music
[0:13:51] <$QueequegTheater> [welsh noises]
[0:13:53] <brachydios777> *are

[0:14:54] <DesertPenguin> Legendary is just fuck you tough
[0:14:56] <derap41> Legendary just fucks you
[0:14:57] <Captain_sevatar> Heroic has some bullshit but its mostly fair
[0:14:58] <huskarl_zap> NO
[0:14:58] <%cowardman93> Heroic is the CANON difficulty
[0:14:59] <%threeheadedwalrus> NOT YET

[0:14:59] <%optimasmaximas> LEGENDARY IS A BITCH

[0:15:02] <+wunp_fxs> except if u do it to yourself
[0:15:03] <huskarl_zap> BULLSHITE
[0:15:03] <$jake5713> Aaaaw.
[0:15:03] <%MacabreOpus> Legendary is fine.
[0:15:05] <alrobot2014> Woolie will need to be put on life support for Legendary
[0:15:06] <derap41> @DesertPenguin Jinxs
[0:15:07] <Halospaz117> Legendary is CBT mode
[0:15:07] <drewslo> last level of odst on legendary is brutal
[0:15:08] <TheChucklingOak> Legendary is just the meme difficulty
[0:15:11] <%Intersceptre> H2 Legendary is horseshit with Jackal snipers, they're aimbots
[0:15:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah
[0:15:12] <+Estuko> Legendary is a BIT MUCH imo
[0:15:16] <Xiangchang> Legendary's for masochism.
[0:15:16] <%threeheadedwalrus> legendary is premium BS
[0:15:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> stick to heroic
[0:15:20] <IndoorSitup> Legendary is for people who practice CBT.
[0:15:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Legendary kinda just turns into "How much of this level can I skip somehow?"
[0:15:20] <KingVantq> Halo 3 LASO confirmed
[0:15:21] <brachydios777> Legendary is bragging rights
[0:15:24] <keithKatze> @Halospaz117 commitee on bible translation?
[0:15:25] <DinoBear_7> Halo 3 legendary is fine honestly
[0:15:26] <huskarl_zap> Heroic on halo 2 and one makes me want to pull out my hair
[0:15:28] <Depthcharge2030> Costal Highway is unforgiving due to certain...factors
[0:15:28] <$deadredeyez> noice
[0:15:29] <%optimasmaximas> nice V!
[0:15:31] <DesertPenguin> Also, @WoolieVersus, Shotguns are close range only LUL
[0:15:31] <+jeasybakeoven> Halo 3 Legendary is fuckin easy
[0:15:33] <centuronstar> Halo CE Legendary is absolutely insane.
[0:15:34] <%GrumbleGrouse> reload after EVERY engagement
[0:15:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> you should never do legendary as a first playthrough. it's like playing your first run on Dante Must Die difficulty or something
[0:15:38] <%Papa_Bearman> Wait, is today 'Halo' or 'TTYD'? The notification I got said 'TTYD'.
[0:15:39] <%Slimshazbot> Yeah, legendary 1st time is not the way to do it
[0:15:42] <thebestestkevin> legendary is "me and the bois are in a sleepover and want some bullshit shenanigans"
[0:15:43] <Halospaz117> @keithKatze I mean isn't that just the covenant?
[0:15:43] <$serpenttucker> Legendary is for people who have already played the game
[0:15:44] <+Estuko> @Xiangchang basically, it's for people who kinda don't value their own physical and mental health and just want to get beaten and stepped on. Like me
[0:15:44] <huskarl_zap> Halo 3 is the best balanced
[0:15:45] <GoogleyGareth> LUL you saw that reddit thread didn't you?
[0:15:47] <$QueequegTheater> @Papa_Bearman Halo
[0:15:50] <+wunp_fxs> halo 3 heroic feels sooo goood. espcially compared to two
[0:15:50] <Captain_sevatar> one of the later levels in 3 on legendary is absolute bullshit
[0:15:52] <%Slimshazbot> @Papa_Bearman Yeah its Halo, the TTYD was a mistake
[0:15:57] <keithKatze> @Halospaz117 so the covenant is cbt
[0:15:57] <%RioGascar> Then theres LASO
[0:16:02] <Ynkubus_> Legendary is also using skips and tricks
[0:16:06] <%RioGascar> which is know everything
[0:16:06] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It's Woolies first time through Halo. Freaking chill with the Legendary talk. Heroic is perfect with someone to help when needed
[0:16:06] <%Intersceptre> Heroic is a videogame. Legendary is a puzzle.
[0:16:06] <Halospaz117> @keithKatze Exactly
[0:16:08] <DinoBear_7> That one level yes, disagree on most of 3 tbh
[0:16:08] <%Papa_Bearman> OK, I'm not too into Halo and I gotta work, so I'll see you on TTYD day, folks.
[0:16:10] <WolfemanMaverik> Marty himself said heroic is the best musical experience, at least for 3
[0:16:12] <%falconcrunchv2> I love legendary but who the fuck wants to watch that?
[0:16:17] <Captain_sevatar> ^
[0:16:18] <brian_peppers1> LETS PLAY AUTHORITY
[0:16:23] <%cowardman93> heroic is the canon difficulty so playing on that you're getting story accurate gameplay
[0:16:25] <Dean_Inbetween> And then theres laso which is a complete clusterfuck which will test your patience as a human
[0:16:28] <+VCRUZZO> YUP
[0:16:30] <Halospaz117> Exactly
[0:16:32] <DinoBear_7> But heroic is better for woolz
[0:16:33] <Ashenik1> I only played halo 3 and omg Heroic felt so goooood and Legendary so fucking cheap frustration
[0:16:36] <%SvenHolgersson> Where does David Cage fit on this scale
[0:16:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> watching load screens LUL
[0:16:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @keithkatze the covenant High Priest, the Prophet of Cock and Ball Torture
[0:16:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[0:16:39] <Ashenik1> I did....
[0:16:39] <jorniev> SUFFERING THE BAD is not the same as suffering the difficulty
[0:16:39] <DesertPenguin> If you're good at the game then yea, but this is Woolie and he knows his limits
[0:16:40] <%Slimshazbot> It's almost like Woolie knows what he's doing or something
[0:16:41] <+wunp_fxs> nightmare yes, ultra nightmare fuuuuuck no
[0:16:44] <%DensityD> if you've been doing it for 10 years, why aren't you good yet?- said the shitposter Kappa
[0:16:46] <Halospaz117> DANTE MUST DIE BLIND PLAYTHROUGH
[0:16:49] <Deadmanslegacy> not a choice when it comes to dark souls.
[0:16:50] <%omenzazu> V you guys gunna play Reach? I'd love to see woolie meet George
[0:16:51] <+jeasybakeoven> I just replayed 3 over the weekend on Heroic with some buds and we beat it in like 4 hours, Legendary is much more of a fun challenge
[0:16:53] <brachydios777> Do you guys play Halo on normal first then the harder difficulties or play on heroic first?
[0:16:59] <BritishTyrannosaur> Cock and ball torture mr freeman
[0:17:03] <Captain_sevatar> Hard Agree woolz
[0:17:08] <%RioGascar> as an LP yes its more entertaining to do challenge. Streams where the CHALLENGE ITSELF IS “WE DOING SUPER HARD MODE CAUSE THIS IS THE STREAM” works better
[0:17:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> psaBig WISDOM
[0:17:09] <%emperordread> But live up to my crazy expectations tho Kappa
[0:17:10] <+Arthasgnome> Agree
[0:17:10] <DesertPenguin> @funkizeit Then it will be a quick LP. Deal with it
[0:17:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> Heroic first atleast
[0:17:11] <%Intersceptre> Reach has the best story, fight me.
[0:17:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 10 YEARS
[0:17:11] <%SteinsApprentice> doom was like this for sure
[0:17:12] <R3c0n31> Dante Must Die first time blind play through
[0:17:17] <%pohlcat93> that's LP poison
[0:17:18] <thebestestkevin> even in heroic, theres usually a few sections in each game that are tough enough on your own
[0:17:19] <%Slimshazbot> Halo 3 LASO first time
[0:17:19] <Dean_Inbetween> Yep
[0:17:23] <jorniev> maybe you guys are TOO good at HALO 3 ever think aobut that chat
[0:17:27] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @funkizeit yeah but that was probably you and buds who played through halo when it came out, not someone playing for the first time
[0:17:29] <%DesDavis> ever do what? just tuned in
[0:17:30] <+papasmurf531> wtf is obsession with playing on legendary?Its not some ultra hard thing, but watching that for someone's first playthrough would be such a bad impression
[0:17:32] <$QueequegTheater> HALF JAW HALF JAW
[0:17:32] <%DensityD> he wants to fuck Cortana
[0:17:33] <%SvenHolgersson> ARBY
[0:17:33] <Dorkoblin> Heroic is solid.
[0:17:33] <+X1asdfghjkl1x> How anout just fo what you want to
[0:17:33] <%Intersceptre> Johnson.
[0:17:36] <+wunp_fxs> Johnson
[0:17:38] <%SvenHolgersson> ARBY GOOD
[0:17:38] <%Solidnick18> Johnson
[0:17:39] <%Lunatyr_> Johnson
[0:17:42] <LoganPayne> Cortana
[0:17:42] <Ashenik1> it will come for the Witcher my dudes, it will
[0:17:44] <Divryne> Mister Chef is my favorite character.
[0:17:45] <$QueequegTheater> HE KNOWS WHAT THE LADIES LIKE
[0:17:48] <%chll0ne> space aoc
[0:17:56] <Halospaz117> Halo doesn't have too many characters, but what it has is STRONG
[0:17:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> how ya doin
[0:17:57] <drewslo> only like 8 pelicans crash in the whole series
[0:17:57] <+TheShisno> Halo's a pretty cool guy
[0:18:00] <+mikesapartment> penitent tangent obviously
[0:18:00] <BritishTyrannosaur> halo 4 made me love chief. but Arby was always best boy
[0:18:04] <brachydios777> I usually play normal at first for story then do heroic for more challenge
[0:18:09] <BritishTyrannosaur> Miranda keyes is underrated
[0:18:10] <jorniev> wee need a guy like that in halo infinite
[0:18:14] <%Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus Do you have a favorite alien?
[0:18:15] <%omenzazu> its a halo thing.... i member back then if you aint have that badge....lol

[0:18:19] <+wunp_fxs> id put arby first
[0:18:23] <brachydios777> Johnson is easy top 3
[0:18:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sir Avery, son of John, has wondrous knowledge of the fair maidens' desires.
[0:18:28] <%SvenHolgersson> Ye boii

[0:22:13] <%MasterMushin> Red and Blue is easier for people with color blindness, like me, to differentiate.
[0:22:14] <alrobot2014> that's why the Jamaican flag is superior to all others

[0:23:52] <%ringabal> To quote Woolie: "The THIRD faction!?"
[0:23:54] <bearalin> Anyone else like gray?
[0:23:54] <%emperordread> Green is best power ranger, so I became a green bro
[0:23:55] <+wunp_fxs> blue vs yellow would be nice
[0:23:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Invent a new side of the force just to justify a new lightsaber color.
[0:23:56] <buster7800> i reject my color theory Jojo!
[0:23:59] <IndoorSitup> It should Cyan vs. Orange for colorbline folks.
[0:24:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> opposite ends of the color spectrum?
[0:24:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> ye
[0:24:05] <+wunp_fxs> orange is not red
[0:24:11] <thebestestkevin> technically i think green is more the opposite of red
[0:24:12] <GoogleyGareth> And COWARDANCE
[0:24:13] <%MacabreOpus> CYMK all day
[0:24:15] <akman14> Yellow is PISS
[0:24:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> PeRsOnA
[0:24:17] <%DensityD> super saiyajin
[0:24:20] <%RioGascar> Purple is associated with royalty
[0:24:22] <%Slimshazbot> blue and orange are opposites. not red
[0:24:24] <DesertPenguin> Red and Yellow are always used in food marketing
[0:24:24] <%masterpiecejeremy> PURPLE IS WEALTH
[0:24:28] <BritishTyrannosaur> Colours aren't real shut up
[0:24:30] <+BAC0N_JESUS> people that have their favorite color as purple like purple more than people with any other favorite color
[0:24:31] <karl_rex> Orange and blue not red and blue
[0:24:37] <%eggypigeon> Orange gang rise up
[0:24:39] <DesertPenguin> I'm color blind. What are colors?
[0:24:40] <bearalin> It’s an art
[0:24:40] <Dean_Inbetween> Purple is the rarest color on the spectrum
[0:24:43] <+trllly> Hey Woolie, did you see the trailer for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk? I can guarantee its something youd be interested in if you havent seen it.
[0:24:44] <+Freeborg1997> I love blue.
[0:24:44] <metal303> red and blue were also the cheapest dyes back in the day before computers
[0:24:44] <$QueequegTheater> @thebestestkevin Only in primary color terms. In actual light spectrum, red and blue are opposites
[0:24:44] <+thunka10> Magenta isn't real NotLikeThis
[0:24:44] <%cowardman93> random fact, Red is the last colour you stop registering when you suffer from dementia
[0:24:45] <Saltmeisterr> purple is also an unnatural color
[0:24:45] <$jake5713> Purple is the GOAT of colors.
[0:24:52] <+Sp3ctre48> I think it's just culturally we associate Blue with being the opposite of red, technically that is Green

[0:25:23] <%MacabreOpus> 'Bloody murder! Bloody murder!'
[0:25:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Loved most of it
[0:25:25] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus IT'S SUPER GOOD MILITARY COMEDY COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM BEING A HALO THiNG
[0:25:33] <karl_rex> Man that series went downhill after season 8
[0:25:34] <+TheShisno> Don't let it set in that RvB is 17 years old
[0:25:36] <%shadowsofpain> It unlocks their death
[0:25:37] <BritishTyrannosaur> I ehar the last season was good. but since chorus it's been odd
[0:25:38] <FreedomARX7> Agent Washingtub
[0:25:39] <$QueequegTheater> @karl_rex wrong
[0:25:44] <+phd_in_thuggery> They're ape sized
[0:25:45] <Decimated_body> Grunt's are taller than pat
[0:25:45] <+YabbaTroll> they are always hunched down
[0:25:45] <Captain_sevatar> Hunters are 9ft maybe 10
[0:25:46] <%DensityD> a horse
[0:25:48] <sniffy77> A grunt can technically tear out someone's intestines
[0:25:48] <%optimasmaximas> psaWrong
[0:25:48] <%RioGascar> Im watching it right now again. i know i stopped around s10 but now im s13
[0:25:49] <Halospaz117> Ok, Elephant is a bit much
[0:25:49] <%Lunatyr_> Gorilla sized?
[0:25:52] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Grunts are Pat sized
[0:25:52] <%jiggy_snipe> that's not better
[0:25:53] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus RvB ends at season 13
[0:25:54] <TheChucklingOak> They CAN be elephants, in the looooore
[0:25:55] <$serpenttucker> Still they are FUCKING HUGE
[0:25:56] <drewslo> hunters can be as big as the colony wants
[0:25:57] <Ashenik1> Bear
[0:25:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> grunts are taller than pat
[0:25:58] <alrobot2014> grunts are like 5 feet tall, which makes them a huge threat to me
[0:25:59] <%threeheadedwalrus> Big dog
[0:26:00] <$QueequegTheater> @RioGascar Stop at the end of 13

[0:26:06] <Dean_Inbetween> Elites are 8 feet tall and brutes 9
[0:26:07] <+wunp_fxs> moose are crazy big
[0:26:08] <%jiggy_snipe> it's moose or rhino or hippo sized. Ok..
[0:26:10] <GoogleyGareth> Yeah you get Moose bigger than Jeeps.
[0:26:11] <Halospaz117> Moose vs Hunter LETS GO
[0:26:12] <%Intersceptre> Moose are 20m tall minimum
[0:26:13] <Ultimatefool> Goddamn meese
[0:26:14] <TheChucklingOak> Moose are scarier than elephants
[0:26:15] <Dean_Inbetween> They are 12 feet tall
[0:26:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Me too
[0:26:15] <DinoBear_7> In later games absolutely
[0:26:16] <Ynkubus_> Hunters when standing upright are big boys
[0:26:17] <Noble_Nobunaga > Fun fact: Moose are commonly hunter by Killer Whales!
[0:26:17] <%BisoromiBear> do moose spikes work on hunters?
[0:26:17] <+LeaIsChill> THEY'RE SO BIG EVEN IN A VEHICLE
[0:26:18] <bearalin> Moose with a gun
[0:26:19] <%Ancopro> i think recreation was the one right after the 5th season, and that's pretty much the best stopping point
[0:26:20] <Captain_sevatar> The wild meese
[0:26:21] <ashenjuan25> Grunts are cannon taller than pat
[0:26:23] <wraithtaker162> What's up party people, first time catchin one of these streams
[0:26:24] <Dean_Inbetween> Hunters are 12 feet
[0:26:29] <+wunp_fxs> Room with a moose is still the scariest thing
[0:26:30] <%DensityD> but Pat is tiny
[0:26:30] <beefboi18> hey hey people
[0:26:30] <%doomerskeletor13> They’re fucking huge

[0:26:31] <$QueequegTheater> @optimasmaximas No, those are filthy lies. (The finale of S13 was the perfect end point)
[0:26:37] <+TheShisno> Moose are deceptively deadly
[0:26:40] <%DensityD> hello sseth

[0:27:07] <brachydios777> Chief is like 7 feet tall
[0:27:07] <%omenzazu> if you slow down itll crush your vehicle
[0:27:08] <%Intersceptre> Brutes would be the scariest, just the size of then
[0:27:10] <+BigBlackBankai> Hunters are 12 feet tall, so they are taller than an Indian Elephant's shoulder.

[0:27:48] <$QueequegTheater> @optimasmaximas sorry
[0:27:48] <BritishTyrannosaur> on;y one not getting a grappling hook is serious sam
[0:27:51] <Brutalyte616> And a Scarab is probably bigger than any land-based organism depending on which game you use as reference.
[0:27:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> fucking nice
[0:27:53] <alrobot2014> yep
[0:27:55] <$QueequegTheater> YES

[0:28:04] <+JVolfram> I remember lugging CRT's over to my step-dad's family's to play multiplayer on Halo 2
[0:28:05] <ashenjuan25> PvE is much more fun to me than pvp tbh
[0:28:06] <$QueequegTheater> HE SPEAKS IN SHAKESPEARE
[0:28:07] <Dean_Inbetween> Funny thing is master chiefs bones have the density of iron so he’s actually more anatomy wise more resistant than elites or brutes to an extant
[0:28:08] <%shadowsofpain> yep what a learned individual
[0:28:09] <%DensityD> that's a sex move
[0:28:11] <$QueequegTheater> BUT BETTER
[0:28:11] <%BisoromiBear> gravemind works out at the library
[0:28:12] <$Rumbutt> Seven is always the number in Bungie games
[0:28:13] <subjectg> BECAUSE BUNGIE
[0:28:14] <%ringabal> Well what else are you supposed to do with mind poetry
[0:28:16] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s a rap god
[0:28:20] <bearalin> Elder knowledge here
[0:28:23] <DesertPenguin> But why though?
[0:28:24] <+phd_in_thuggery> That's a good one
[0:28:28] <alrobot2014> yo for real though fuck iambic pentameter
[0:28:32] <duskrush> You want some real shit: Vegeta is 5'5" and grunts are on average 5'6"

[0:28:40] <pixel_river> yeah
[0:28:44] <%GrumbleGrouse> scarab is rad
[0:28:45] <+wunp_fxs> thats a good one
[0:28:47] <TheChucklingOak> Most of Vegeta's height is from his hair
[0:28:51] <%optimasmaximas> @duskrush shoulda replaced vegeta with pat LUL
[0:28:51] <Dean_Inbetween> Frieza is 5’3
[0:28:52] <Halospaz117> Yeah the Scarab boarding is still hype
[0:28:55] <alrobot2014> @shadowsofpain oh god it is another 7
[0:29:01] <ashenjuan25> Gravemind in classic halo 2 is goofy looking tho let’s not lie to ourselves

[0:29:05] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Reminder that Grunts are taller than Vegeta
[0:29:06] <+phd_in_thuggery> even a botched warthog run is a FUN one

[0:29:10] <brachydios777> @shadowsofpain SEVENTH COLUMN
[0:29:14] <puckiyo> Oh man Woolie's gonna love the scarabs in Halo 3
[0:29:15] <Halospaz117> warthog run best girl
[0:29:16] <%RioGascar> @gunslinger_xxiv 1 player has shit tons of health but can move very slow and the rest have 0 hp but move normal speed. if you dont fight fat kid he can regain his health so way to win for fat kid is to trap the people in corners of smaller maps
[0:29:16] <Brutalyte616> @duskrush Is that with or without his hair?
[0:29:20] <%ringabal> TOP THREE HUH
[0:29:22] <Captain_sevatar> That first odst drop on the ring blew teenage me's mind
[0:29:23] <iamtheTwitchghost> definitely for me
[0:29:24] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Yeah Scarab boarding is pretty hype! Wonder if they do anything like that in future games...
[0:29:27] <+KingOfTheGeats> it was an experience

[0:30:48] <DatAsuna> eh give em their time
[0:30:48] <thebestestkevin> to be slightly fair, the pacing is weirder in the blur cutscenes vs regular
[0:30:50] <%optimasmaximas> SHUT UP

[0:31:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> yakuza is fucking sick
[0:31:49] <%Pop_O_Matic> I mean, I kind of like the visual cohesion of the in-engine cutscenes with the rest of the game, and the lipsync of the Blur cutscenes does look a bit odd, but otherwise...
[0:31:49] <$QueequegTheater> WHY ARE THEY SPENDiNG SO MUCH MONEY
[0:31:50] <%jinking79> now is Mark coming back for Majima
[0:31:51] <DSD24> I like the English
[0:31:51] <+LeaIsChill> Tsushima is only English which is WEIRD
[0:31:53] <+wunp_fxs> thats why i watch ghibli movies in subs...
[0:31:54] <TheChucklingOak> I could have sworn the original cutscene it was a tentacle? Eh it doesn't really matter in the end.
[0:31:54] <%jiggy_snipe> so it wasn't a nitpick if its relevant
[0:31:55] <ashenjuan25> woolieTRASH Got my trash ye

[0:32:20] <%threeheadedwalrus> @Pop_O_Matic I feel like the remaster graphics were good enough to match the cutscene aesthetics
[0:32:27] <%MasterMushin> V are you saying sub over dub?
[0:32:28] <+BigBlackBankai> Vas Qwib Qwib
[0:32:31] <%MacabreOpus> Try watching The Raid in English dub, it's unwatchable.
[0:32:33] <$QueequegTheater> Dub > Sub
[0:32:33] <cyb3r_demon> dub is cringe

[0:32:43] <+wunp_fxs> same with ff7r, good shit
[0:32:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> SUBS OVER DUBS
[0:32:44] <huskarl_zap> japanese is the dub
[0:32:45] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:32:45] <%raven_frame> cheer500 Some names and light lore I wanted to share, so please have V check it first. The Spartan armour is called Mjolnir. Halo Wars has the previous Arbiter; named Ripa 'Moramee, who commands the fleet of Glorious Interdiction. The Ee in the names Vadamee and Moramee is an honorific that denotes military service to the Covenant. And in the last cut scene you saw ships shooting at each other outside of High Charity, although it's hard to tell in the remastered cut scenes.
[0:32:46] <DSD24> Dub is not cringe

[0:32:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @theshisno I thought the tentacle tried to drop her right when she got the Index.
[0:32:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @pop_o_matic complaining about the blur cutscenes is like saying you'd rather eat a mcdonalds burger instead of a free $100 kobe burger because the latter is cooked medium well instead of medium

[0:34:10] <%arkv01> mmmm not sure about homogenous clarity
[0:34:10] <+wunp_fxs> my fav is truth and reconciliation in halo 1
[0:34:12] <+JVolfram> Halo 2 originally had a Hoobastank song on the OST
[0:34:15] <%Pyroclase> Homogenous Clarity for High Charity's fleet works really good

[0:34:40] <%DensityD> RAISE. YOUR. SWORD.
[0:34:44] <%raven_frame> Good thing this limits things to five hundred characters, otherwise I would've said a ton of stuff, I had to trim.
[0:34:44] <TheChucklingOak> Halo 2 was really into nu-metal, but it works way better than other game
[0:34:45] <spicybento> Best Ship Name: The Uneven Elephant
[0:34:46] <%Solidnick18> it's pretty fun. but lot of sidequests are the same.
[0:34:48] <%Pop_O_Matic> And Incubus did a fucking 4 part jazz odyssey on the H2 soundtrack

[0:37:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> But you need to refill your super meter.
[0:37:40] <+trllly> Is this before the game or after the game?
[0:37:41] <TheChucklingOak> Just only use plasma weapons so you dont have to reload and piss off everyone
[0:37:43] <KingVantq> turn off auto reload and only pick up new guns LUL
[0:37:43] <+cdrom321> Hey. This isn't Paper Mario.
[0:37:47] <@Menitta> Reloading is for bitches. You gotta throw the gun at your enemies

[0:38:26] <Dean_Inbetween> Time for woolie to start doing battle rifle combos PogChamp
[0:38:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> actually i don't know if people are mad about not reloading as much as not swapping an empty gun

[0:38:45] <SereneFox> Every time the game forces you to reload, shoot a single bullet so your clip is never full.

[0:39:14] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Solution to every puzzle: Bring Combat Rifle

[0:40:11] <BurdRightsActivist> SHIT SOUNDTRACK
[0:40:14] <$QueequegTheater> FOUR IS GOOD YOU FOOLS
[0:40:15] <TheChucklingOak> It's got some good ones tho
[0:40:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Blue Shift, Opposing Forces, and there was a third one I forgot the name of it
[0:40:17] <subjectg> Xbox 2fort 4ever
[0:40:17] <asd2897> 117 is decent
[0:40:18] <%Slimshazbot> 5's soundtrack tough? 5's is... bad.
[0:40:19] <thebestestkevin> 117 is one of those standouts imo
[0:40:20] <BritishTyrannosaur> Halo 4's narrative is bae fight me
[0:40:21] <%doomerskeletor13> I like 4
[0:40:21] <+phd_in_thuggery> 4 exists
[0:40:22] <The_Swedish_X> That's a nice cup.
[0:40:22] <huskarl_zap> wooliePOYO Gravemind
[0:40:22] <drewslo> 4 is fine 5 is hot trash
[0:40:23] <%DensityD> it's a tampon in a teacup
[0:40:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> NIDHOGG
[0:40:26] <+trllly> Wait, are you gonna skip Halo 4? That would be really lame
[0:40:28] <+in_spaaace> four is okay
[0:40:33] <BurdRightsActivist> 4 IS SHIT, feel BAD for liking the OST
[0:40:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:40:33] <DatAsuna> 5 is generic but 4 is fire
[0:40:33] <zamzoph> music spoilers
[0:40:33] <karl_rex> 4 has a good story but trash gameplay
[0:40:33] <%GrumbleGrouse> Halo 4 ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:40:36] <brachydios777> Halo 4’s soundtrack isn’t as good but it’s not bad
[0:40:36] <+popeplays402> Going right into 3 after this? Loving this play though, H2 is my favorite of all time
[0:40:37] <seniormeatbox> 4 has better singleplayer than 5
[0:40:37] <DatAsuna> soudntrackwise
[0:40:38] <+BigBlackBankai> Halo 4's narrative is the only positive to give.
[0:40:43] <sniffy77> i cannot confirm or deny that song titles will have spoilers
[0:40:44] <LasagnaXaga> Woolie, V! Love it every time you're together! Any plans on doind another RPG together after KotoR2?
[0:40:44] <+in_spaaace> 5 sucks though
[0:40:46] <+quinnage7> four is alright but 5 is a fumbled pass
[0:40:46] <subjectg> 4 is ok and the music is decently alien
[0:40:46] <thebestestkevin> I like 4's story (mostly), hated its multiplayer
[0:40:46] <%DensityD> Let's Players gotta Lets Play
[0:40:49] <ofalconer> Replaying 4 now and its...not my fave
[0:40:49] <huskarl_zap> Halo 4 is better than 5 somehow
[0:40:51] <zamzoph> NERRRRRD
[0:40:51] <+trllly> 4 is better than 5
[0:40:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> god 4
[0:40:56] <%andrex2311> oof
[0:40:56] <+wunp_fxs> Same V
[0:40:58] <$QueequegTheater> @trllly He's said nothing, but the podcast got an email demanding he skip 4 and 5
[0:40:59] <Decimated_body> Gears of war ost is FIRE
[0:41:01] <Dorkoblin> yeah i liked aspects of 4's story.
[0:41:02] <%Deadpal> Halo 4 and 5 both use prerendered cutscenes
[0:41:05] <MajoraZ> Woolie would actually really enjoy 5's movement abilities, I think
[0:41:05] <%GrumbleGrouse> 4 and 5 are both mediocre
[0:41:06] <drewslo> I think I know the song
[0:41:06] <buster7800> 4 is worth playing,5 is the trash one
[0:41:07] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Neil Davidge did H4 and it was good Also H4 is great (Woolie will appreciate the lore). H5 has decent combat
[0:41:09] <%shadowsofpain> 4's story is good, but 5 has poised the fanbase to it
[0:41:10] <%Firststrike_OW> Always the case
[0:41:11] <vulkan_vibes> NEVER FORGET
[0:41:13] <Halospaz117> The song I remember most from Halo 4 is a remix of a Halo 3 song
[0:41:13] <%Ancopro> 4 got rid of martin didn't they
[0:41:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lewdskeletor13 There was Half Life: Decay, which was like a coop port for one of the Playstations.
[0:41:16] <%cowardman93> 117 from 4 is the best song and everyone can fight me
[0:41:16] <ralphfromdk> Would that song be "never forget" ?
[0:41:17] <+phd_in_thuggery> FOREVER PAIN
[0:41:17] <%DensityD> crack open a new franchise and WE COME CRAWLING OUT
[0:41:18] <%arkv01> it never ends ScaredyCat
[0:41:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IN THE END WE ALWAYS SUFFER
[0:41:19] <asd2897> let things end when they're over!
[0:41:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't remember 4 other than i hate the new enemies and that ALL THE NEW WEAPONS ARE WORTHLESS
[0:41:21] <alrobot2014> life's secret sauce: SUFFERING
[0:41:22] <%RadicalWeegee> Thats WHA HAPPONS!
[0:41:23] <+TheotherKristian> Metroid Prime, that's it
[0:41:24] <+Cerberus_NV> 4's story is good. Game is decent overall.
[0:41:24] <+TheShisno> It's ALWAYS suffering
[0:41:24] <%ringabal> Being a vidya player is suffering
[0:41:26] <stayinthepocket> I just replayed 4 and it gets a bad rap imo
[0:41:26] <%optimasmaximas> 117, to galaxy, andf nemesis are amazing
[0:41:26] <%omenzazu> I think i know which 3 for me is the menu music
[0:41:31] <MetaChiefVoices> obviou1Queen
[0:41:31] <+Moaradin> i want to like halo again
[0:41:33] <+TheShisno> 4 is good.
[0:41:33] <%arkv01> alexa play In the End
[0:41:33] <TheChucklingOak> There wasn't any suffering from 4, it was good tho
[0:41:33] <masterfire23> infinite maybe
[0:41:33] <starlessdan> praying for infinite to be good
[0:41:33] <Halospaz117> PLEASE BE GOOD INFINITE
[0:41:36] <RiverBirch> I hope everybody is having a good day.
[0:41:36] <%kelvinxj> 3's main menu theme makes me cry
[0:41:38] <jorniev> AND THEN DESTINY HAPPENS
[0:41:39] <DatAsuna> to galaxy also great yee
[0:41:39] <Trecrimson> the forward until dawn live action lead up to 4 was cool
[0:41:40] <OverlordLuna> PogChamp
[0:41:40] <bubbli97> @WoolieVersus will you play all Halo games?
[0:41:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> 4 sucks
[0:41:41] <brachydios777> 117 is pretty good
[0:41:44] <%DensityD> thanks riverbirch
[0:41:45] <drewslo> halo 4 on legendary is true suffering
[0:41:46] <+TheShisno> Prayer circle for Infinite
[0:41:48] <%Slimshazbot> I really don't see how Infinite can fix Halo 5's story fuckups, but maybe the multiplayer will be worth it
[0:41:48] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Hey guys, Have you watched the video about the guy singlehandedly created a real life Warhog by himself?
[0:41:48] <+trllly> @QueequegTheater Oh, then people need to chill. Lol, people actually out here demanding stuff of Woolie
[0:41:49] <MetaChiefVoices> Infinite box art is ORGASMIC
[0:41:53] <BritishTyrannosaur> 4 was based of a writers experiences with his dying mother. you can feel the seriousness and passion
[0:41:53] <subjectg> i want to be able to say that I’m a halo fan and not receive pity
[0:41:53] <huskarl_zap> I watched all of 5s cutscenes and I said "Oh god"
[0:41:59] <$QueequegTheater> @Halospaz117 You see what the box art confirmed?
[0:42:03] <Dean_Inbetween> Never forget is legitimately a great military tribute song that makes me choke up BibleThump
[0:42:04] <ashenjuan25> Infinite might be ok maybe
[0:42:04] <BurdRightsActivist> THE RIPPA
[0:42:06] <+pedrothecruel> woolie play warhammer 40k space mariane. I command it
[0:42:09] <brachydios777> @huskarl_zap Yeah it was not great

[0:42:55] <keithKatze> aaaaa aa a aaaaa aaa aaa

[0:42:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> @optimasmaximas i'm sorry i don't like a trash game
[0:43:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:43:02] <+yhom_tork> REACH IS GOOD TOO
[0:43:02] <TheChucklingOak> The only arguably poor part of 4 was the multiplayer, but Woolz is only doing campaign so it's fiiiine
[0:43:05] <centuronstar> @Dunder_Mifflinz Big agree
[0:43:07] <+mikesapartment> gameplay just in time for lunch to be over :)
[0:43:08] <Jaku2011> Halo 4 will forever be ok
[0:43:08] <alrobot2014> @Halospaz117 they'll at least have reach if its not around by then
[0:43:12] <%DensityD> AMAZING EMPTY COUCH
[0:43:17] <+chunkyfranku> empty couch time
[0:43:18] <%chirochan224> Rock on Woolie!!

[0:43:22] <%Deadpal> Oh yeah and reach, you will unlock a lot of custom content for it since you're playing halo 2 and 3 right now
[0:43:24] <+Fenrein> @thechucklingoak that game’s level design is bland and boring af

[0:43:31] <Bluefox422> Normal difficulty?
[0:43:33] <ChernoMuncho> wow i got here just in time apparently
[0:43:33] <%optimasmaximas> @CaptainPileDriver take off the nostalgia goggles and actually be open-minded to it, it's not trash, it's good, just not great, get over it
[0:43:39] <subjectg> i like halo 4 but i understand how people hold a grudge over it
[0:43:39] <+Fenrein> Knights are also a pain to fight
[0:43:41] <%RunningNGunning> Surprise stream guest Woolies Couch PogChammp
[0:43:41] <brachydios777> The one universal in the 343 era is that 5’s story was a massive disappointment

[0:43:59] <duskrush> You will search one likely spot, and you will search another. Fate would have us meet as foes, BUT THE BATHROOM WILL MAKE US BROTHERS
[0:44:02] <%The_Timo> @WoolieVersus Have you checked out a game on early access right now called MASS Builder?
[0:44:05] <TheChucklingOak> Level design could be better in certain portions, but overall 4 had some good enviroments and arenas, and the story is where it's at.
[0:44:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> @optimasmaximas it's my fucking opionion, it's not "nostalgia goggles" you fucking twat

[0:44:37] <TheChucklingOak> Skins for CE now actually, you can choose between them and Reach
[0:44:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> @optimasmaximas i think the game is trash and i will continue to call it trash because i did not enjoy the game, cry about my opinion more

[0:44:41] <Dean_Inbetween> 4 was also made in 2 years by a brand new team with no good direction

[0:44:46] <ChernoMuncho> halo 4 is where it started to go downhill imo
[0:44:49] <%threeheadedwalrus> best song
[0:44:49] <BritishTyrannosaur> Master chief is sustaine by his own crap. you heard it here first
[0:44:50] <DeepSearch27> lmao
[0:44:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Such a great song
[0:44:57] <$jake5713> One of the only reasons I liked 5 was Buck/Nathan Filion. Also Reach was the first Halo I ever played all the way through so it still holds a special place in my heart.

[0:45:26] <Catpurrple> Bickering at each other instead of at the streamers
[0:45:26] <Oscarthemowerman> V, if the armor doesn't suck you off why even care about halo?
[0:45:26] <%threeheadedwalrus> Woolie Vs DSP
[0:45:27] <DeepSearch27> the "one guy" meme really helps putting people down
[0:45:27] <%krispen_wa> V Versus Reddit
[0:45:27] <The_Swedish_X> More shoots need firing.
[0:45:27] <%jiggy_snipe> it's always chat vs chat
[0:45:28] <lotharrio> I blame it all on One Guy.
[0:45:29] <DigitalJoshie> shots fired at one guy you could say
[0:45:29] <R3c0n31> ACCOUNTABLITY?
[0:45:30] <brachydios777> Halo 4 was going in an interesting direction but 5 Rise of Skywalker it

[0:45:38] <shadowboss89> I love chat too \:-?\)
[0:45:38] <%xcompleasedad> I mean, spamming woolieONEGUY IS a form of accountability.

[0:45:42] <%RioGascar> V, whats your favorite RvB quote?
[0:45:42] <+quinnage7> @woolieversus be sure to tell Woolie that the first room where you start in Gravemind is a fucking nightmare on Legendary

[0:45:53] <TheChucklingOak> Chat is made up of thousands of "one guys"
[0:45:53] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> H4 is awesome. People don't care much about MP but who cares here when Woolie won't be playing MP and wants the story (Which is epic)

[0:55:55] <duskrush> generally you only tap to reload because you don't want to run out of bullets mid-fight
[0:56:00] <$QueequegTheater> It is NOT a bad habit
[0:56:02] <%RioGascar> never have a half empty clip
[0:56:03] <%jiggy_snipe> it's because of reloading when you need to shoot
[0:56:04] <TheChucklingOak> Yes Cortana, we know it's locked

[1:00:46] <%optimasmaximas> @huskarl_zap dude fucking stop
[1:00:51] <+YabbaTroll> does it actually do more damage?
[1:00:52] <lotharrio> It's an infinite but weaker sword.
[1:00:55] <Ynkubus_> its lethal
[1:00:56] <%optimasmaximas> @huskarl_zap youre gonna get yourself permabanned
[1:01:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's pretty solid
[1:01:01] <ChernoMuncho> can you still spam the melee with the brute shot?
[1:01:01] <sniffy77> i think its like melee 1.5x

[1:01:21] <$QueequegTheater> @huskarl_zap Please learn what pattern recognition is
[1:01:24] <SoaringLettuce> gun with sword handle
[1:01:25] <%raven_frame> The Brute shot is way better in Halo 3.
[1:01:27] <%ringabal> Ah yes, space Midgar
[1:01:29] <$QueequegTheater> @Darksolstace No, he keeps using caps lock
[1:01:31] <DesertPenguin> wow
[1:01:34] <TheChucklingOak> part of me wishes the brute shot melee was instant kill, just with no lunge. Might be too much of a gamebreaker tho
[1:01:35] <LoganPayne> the old graphics imply its way bigger to me
[1:01:36] <%Firststrike_OW> Square skyscrapers?! wierd
[1:01:36] <%Pyroclase> This is the inside of a MOON, apparently. It's so cool.
[1:01:40] <Apple_Tuna> this actress sounds super familiar
[1:01:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:41] <%RioGascar> 2004 didnt allow that crazy shit
[1:01:42] <%krispen_wa> why would you put a space ship next to skyscrapers tho?
[1:01:43] <%optimasmaximas> @Darksolstace nah, he just keeps shouting in caps and moobot has timed him out like 3 times already
[1:01:49] <thebestestkevin> it took me way too long to realize high charity was a city in the old graphics LOL
[1:01:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> huskarl likes to be loud, but all the time

[1:02:00] <%DensityD> Cortana, the AI, is currently inside the network of that ENTIRE city. and she's able to break encryption or security into any part of its network. SHE'S IN IT!
[1:02:02] <%xcompleasedad> Jesus. How many people live on this?

[1:02:36] <subjectg> There’s a neat image that shows the scale of things in halo
[1:02:37] <R3c0n31> A moving home planet?
[1:02:39] <Dean_Inbetween> High charity is the size of a small planet
[1:02:42] <%DensityD> this is indeed the council and location where Arbiter got branded
[1:02:42] <SuperFightinRobot> The lights in the sky are STARS
[1:02:42] <Torivore> Truth did High Charity
[1:02:43] <%threeheadedwalrus> This seems like a ship that will totally last throughout the ages!
[1:02:44] <lotharrio> Craft world.
[1:02:45] <LoganPayne> Hey whats that, is that the level
[1:02:45] <@Menitta> Im gonna go buy the MCC right now
[1:02:48] <SoaringLettuce> this is some star trek/orville city ship shit
[1:02:50] <subjectg> and high charity is basically the size of a small moon
[1:02:53] <%Darksolstace> High Charity feels like something 40K Eldar would make.
[1:03:01] <+superkeaton> It's a neo colony from G Gundam
[1:03:02] <%jetjagger222> a craftworld if you will
[1:03:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @subjectg How much of that image would have to be blacked out for spoilers right now?
[1:03:08] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It IS half a planet. lol
[1:03:09] <+Estuko> @Menitta it's fun! go for it a lot of good ones on it so far and ppl playing too :D
[1:03:15] <%Darksolstace> @jetjagger222 indeed
[1:03:21] <TheChucklingOak> I could easly buy a craftworld would look like this
[1:03:22] <%Slimshazbot> @menitta grab gamepass, 1 buck for your first month and 5 every after. the game list is actually pretty impressive
[1:03:26] <+Kyoshikei> Who is playign with Woolie>
[1:03:28] <%jetjagger222> @superkeaton maybe it'd have to be shaped like a giant prophet head or something first

[1:03:41] <R3c0n31> it has a new mechanic
[1:03:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> @kyoshikei Little V Mills, the metal god himself
[1:03:42] <Ynkubus_> This wouldnt be a Craftworld but certaily an Eldar station
[1:03:43] <subjectg> @generalscpatton a rather sizable portion, since one of the largest things is a big big spoiler
[1:03:44] <%MacabreOpus> @Kyoshikei V, the man next to him
[1:03:50] <huskarl_zap> We havent even gotten to halo webways that never come up in the games so its not spoilers.

[1:04:43] <%cowardman93> I like red pew pew despite the blue rifle being objectively better
[1:04:45] <%hattrick61> Spiker is cooler
[1:04:46] <BakerBrute> Dante Vs Vergil plasma rifles
[1:04:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Proper trigger discipline lets you put out great burst damage whenever you need it.
[1:04:53] <+wunp_fxs> man this is so much easier with coop
[1:05:02] <$QueequegTheater> @seniormeatbox Probably not, strong possibility of copyright

[1:06:46] <seniormeatbox> MOH and COD yeah

[1:10:19] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[1:10:20] <ALvl78Zapdos> This mission on legendary is honestly the worst.
[1:10:25] <huskarl_zap> CAPS or kik Kappa
[1:10:26] <%jetjagger222> @Darksolstace its the same color scheme
[1:10:27] <%Slimshazbot> Halo 4 has the best cortana tho
[1:10:29] <seniormeatbox> @optimasmaximas Buck was funny
[1:10:35] <%krispen_wa> THICC CORTANA Kreygasm
[1:10:36] <%Darksolstace> @raven_frame Cortana’s model is good
[1:10:36] <%exnuart> this mission on legendary gave me ptsd
[1:10:36] <%optimasmaximas> @Slimshazbot agreed Kreygasm
[1:10:40] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Woolie can’t even right now.
[1:10:40] <%optimasmaximas> @seniormeatbox true
[1:10:40] <$QueequegTheater> "I literally can't even" -John Sierra, 2553
[1:10:43] <ChernoMuncho> nah halo 3 best cortana imo
[1:10:46] <huskarl_zap> Kreygasm
[1:10:52] <subjectg> Legendary strats is to stick the brutes, find a corner and click heads
[1:10:53] <+armor_kuma> @adre354 No the brute plasma rifle does more damage and shoots faster, it just overheats very quickly
[1:11:00] <%threeheadedwalrus> Obviously WIndows 10 has best cortana
[1:11:02] <%raven_frame> These last levels kick hard. There is a bit of a difficulty spike even on Heroic.
[1:11:03] <huskarl_zap> get your kreys out bous
[1:11:07] <BritishTyrannosaur> That's gonna be a yikes from me chief - John Halo
[1:11:08] <KingVantq> i remember going through this part solo on heroic tbhStressed NotLikeThis
[1:11:13] <DSD24> Halo 4's Cortana has a cute haircut
[1:11:15] <%Darksolstace> Everything is dangerous on legendary
[1:11:16] <%optimasmaximas> @threeheadedwalrus LUL
[1:11:18] <%exnuart> plasma pistol and br the god loadout
[1:11:23] <brian_peppers1> HALO 4 "bowl of oatmeal" cortana is the best
[1:11:27] <%optimasmaximas> @DSD24 facts
[1:11:29] <$QueequegTheater> @DSD24 And is dangerously thicc
[1:11:30] <+yhom_tork> is cortana a tomboy?
[1:11:34] <%DensityD> why are there bugs on the floor? are they in classic graphics too?
[1:11:35] <huskarl_zap> no
[1:11:36] <%optimasmaximas> kinda?
[1:11:38] <+TheShisno> Halo 4 Cortana is my favorite design never @ me
[1:11:41] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 4s cortana has a big butt and a cute gap in her teeth
[1:11:49] <$QueequegTheater> @TheShisno You right tho
[1:11:50] <ALvl78Zapdos> iirc, the devs saw too many people complaining how East Halo CE was on legendary so they went full fuck you mode with H2
[1:11:50] <%DensityD> @TheShisno
[1:11:54] <%jetjagger222> OG halo 1 cortana kinda looked like a boy
[1:11:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Minor book spoiler: Cortana changes a Covenant ship's plasma weapon from a guided projectile to a sustained ship-gutting beam by just modifying the holy config files, which is fucking heresy.
[1:12:02] <Dean_Inbetween> Or at least defined two front teeth
[1:12:06] <R3c0n31> Brute rifle has never come back in any context right?
[1:12:07] <%bravofifeniner> Remember, Cortana looks like a younger version of someone. Imagine being that evil with that much wagon.
[1:12:12] <ChernoMuncho> cortana ages backwards apparently
[1:12:21] <subjectg> @densityd they are
[1:12:22] <%raven_frame> I was talking about the gun models. Oh no, the Storm Rifle. Eugh...
[1:12:24] <+TheShisno> Halo 2 Legendary was just never playtested, cause again, RUSHED

[1:13:40] <Savatewolf> Would the armor even matter?
[1:13:43] <seniormeatbox> @arkv01 brutes need to eat
[1:13:44] <%DensityD> jackals and grunts and brutes don't know what human armor is. only Elites know of the honor of armor and weapons

[1:28:35] <Joestar1890> To be fair, they never got weapons before. So Elites was like "That's kinda rad, here's a gun"
[1:28:35] <+cubbywolf> JACKALS ARE WHITES CONFIRMED
[1:28:36] <seniormeatbox> Jackals just want money

[1:28:46] <brachydios777> Jackels ate ASSHOLES
[1:28:46] <seniormeatbox> Jackals just want the money
[1:28:47] <centuronstar> At the very least Elites after that were like "Yo you guys are actually cool. You can fight with us."
[1:28:47] <%MacabreOpus> ALL JACKALS ARE BASTARDS
[1:28:48] <+Ether101_Prime> Just wait until they start reading 40k.
[1:28:50] <Goraka91> Elites fought until they agreed to a cease fire
[1:28:50] <ashenjuan25> So does that mean the Senghelis have the Unggoy’s back now?
[1:28:50] <+YabbaTroll> brutes sanghelli and hunters are faith based
[1:28:51] <buster7800> jackals are ancap
[1:28:51] <+maenos2> The jackals had their one grounds in high charity encroached by grunts, lost eggs, and weren't happy with the grunts
[1:28:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Jackals are in for money

[1:29:04] <%DensityD> if the kig'yar had any more body mass and power, they would go murder everything because they are so hateful
[1:29:06] <%BisoromiBear> jackals are murder hobos
[1:29:07] <+Sp3ctre48> I think the Hunters fought the Covenant until they threatened to glass their world
[1:29:07] <Djinnazz> Jackels are just space pirates
[1:29:08] <%Theycallmenerf> Kigyar are bastards.
[1:29:08] <+yhom_tork> dangLoot

[1:29:11] <subjectg> The drones couldn’t care less really
[1:29:12] <%Deadpal> Jackals are pirates, Elites are faith based, hunters are faith based, drones are slaves, prophets are deluded, brutes wanted power and faith.
[1:29:13] <%MacabreOpus> AJAB ALL JACKALS ARE BASTARDS

[1:29:40] <vulkan_vibes> brutes were occupational forces
[1:29:42] <sniffy77> Jackals tried to fight back at first but they stood no chance against the covenant fleet. They weren't very faithful (though some were) so the covenant are fine just paying them for their service.

Of course they were expected to serve as cannon fodder from thereon, but they were still treated better than humans.

[1:44:06] <Halospaz117> There is also Desert Bus Halo 2
[1:44:06] <%DensityD> in cursed halo, isn't the energy sword modded in and it is comically double sized?
[1:44:07] <LoganPayne> Cursed halo is good stuff
[1:44:07] <%dekkitout> @huskarl_zap It's free and has alot of shit to do
[1:44:10] <+CptBritches> Oh yeah Vinny played that I think
[1:44:11] <ssks123> my favorite is the d20 grenades
[1:44:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> i like in Grezzo 2 when you kick with both lets
[1:44:12] <%jetjagger222> is it anything like russian overkill doom
[1:44:13] <The_Swedish_X> Just turn into goro
[1:44:14] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus V tell Woolie about the D20 grenades
[1:44:14] <%Pinkiefan> Show woolie
[1:44:14] <Goraka91> @Freeborg23 I mean yeah but we've never seen what that really means
[1:44:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> legs*
[1:44:15] <%cowardman93> Cursed Edition is incredible
[1:44:16] <%optimasmaximas> @KingOfTheGeats what does that sentence mean
[1:44:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> You would expect the evolution of a sapient race to include a subconscious barometer of how lush and bountiful their environment is.
[1:44:24] <SuperFightinRobot> Picked up 3 plasma rifles and an extra arm
[1:44:25] <Torivore> I like the bit crushed plasma rifle
[1:44:25] <+TheShisno> The unmodified Halo 1 pistol is good fun
[1:44:26] <Zeemod155> Ohh tripple "Wield" I heard Tripple "Wheeled"
[1:44:28] <huskarl_zap> @dekkitout is it good though?
[1:44:28] <ashenjuan25> Goro chief
[1:44:29] <MiiRCY> My fav part of cursed halo is the thanos cock
[1:44:29] <Prevot> zoro style?
[1:44:29] <ChernoMuncho> with thses tactics?flaccid sniper
[1:44:29] <brachydios777> Cursed Edition had a flying warthog
[1:44:30] <%Asuterisuku> I know Reach had a plasma rifle you could manually cool off.
[1:44:32] <centuronstar> Why does that remind me of the gag of blocking two hands only to get hit by a third that comes out of nowhere lol.
[1:44:33] <LoganPayne> Sword!
[1:44:34] <%Darksolstace> “Take a Chance on me!”
[1:44:35] <huskarl_zap> why is it free?
[1:44:37] <%doomerskeletor13> It always plays an ABBA song sometimes when you throw a grenade
[1:44:39] <%dekkitout> @huskarl_zap Elaborate "good"
[1:44:40] <+Ether101_Prime> Don't forget the d20 grenades with random effects.
[1:44:42] <%doomerskeletor13> *also
[1:44:44] <seniormeatbox> @Asuterisuku plasma repeater, yeah
[1:44:51] <subjectg> @kingofthegeats i’m a big fan of the random chance for twitch ban in there too
[1:44:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> there should be places where you can go into coolant pools like in Halo 1 and it auto cools your gun
[1:45:01] <Goraka91> @Freeborg23 Like by universes do they just mean several planets in different universes like Xen and not like, a literal entire universe
[1:45:03] <TheChucklingOak> Like an anime grapple scene, but while the characters are grabbing each other
[1:45:06] <%raven_frame> Man is it awhile before that room.
[1:45:07] <%RunningNGunning> Universe was VERY wrong about which room it was

[2:09:14] <+Jaysky> Hi, it's me who said I preferred it in a single section. Believe it or not I didn't say the remake looked bad I just said I preferred how the colors popped in the old version.
[2:09:16] <SoaringLettuce> old halo 1 was better
[2:09:16] <DSD24> Urien shoulder tackles
[2:09:19] <%raven_frame> Oh good.
[2:09:22] <TimetodiveLTX> this choir is too high end to loop this way
[2:09:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @shapeforn in this game sure. In Halo CE the entirety of level 6 is trash in updated graphics
[2:09:23] <herzogtheanimal> I don't think people are saying the old is better, there are just some scenes with mistakes
[2:09:26] <+ArtemisCroc> V is honestly being way too confrontational over nothing, it's kind of annoying to have him making fun of people who enjoy old stuff lol

[2:11:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @shapeforn i DO think that Blur is using a biiiiit too much lens flare but that doesnt stop it from being beautiful and objectively superior. it could just be even more superior if they toned that down
[2:11:11] <+Williamld> @subjectg Just can't handle being wrong, eh?
[2:11:11] <+slimmixrp> Did he die
[2:11:11] <%MacabreOpus> @Jaysky Saying the Blur work is objectively better. However you may feel different emotions by relishing the nostalgia factor and reminiscing the original colour palettes, storytelling flow and animations.
[2:11:13] <buster7800> BETRAYAL
[2:11:14] <DSD24> @a_goth_pancake Someone mentioned that they prefer the old graphics in some cases and V disagrees and says the new graphics are better

[2:11:19] <Saffry_Ruzin> YOU just killed an Elite!

[2:11:21] <DeepSearch27> The dude he just murdered held an ENERGY SWORD
[2:11:23] <%krispen_wa> I mean V is justified in hating us, but if THIS is the stuff that makes him angry, he really couldn't handle chats that are worse than us
[2:11:26] <$QueequegTheater> But then Woolie happened

[2:11:40] <+shapeforn> @LiquidDinosaur Oh for sure, they probably saw one too many JJ Abrams movies and got a little inspired

[2:12:11] <+yhom_tork> the grunts were salivating at the thought of the race war LuL
[2:12:14] <%Solidnick18> jackals are dicks
[2:12:18] <+Estuko> imo if you share different opinions and want to really argue/discuss it to lengths probably take it to dm's? NotLikeThis
[2:12:21] <Captain_sevatar> so many swords
[2:12:23] <+Williamld> @subjectg Normally I just roll my eyes at your type, but you just keep shouting into the void.
[2:12:23] <+Jaysky> @MacabreOpus And I agree. However there's a point when a game becomes so overly detailed that objectives become blurred in with the rest of the gorgeous scenery. It LOOKS amazing though.
[2:12:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> Race war. Race war never changes.
[2:12:26] <TimetodiveLTX> the jackals have NO honor
[2:12:29] <Firemane1279> @herzogtheanimal welcome to opinions if that is what you qualify as dickish.
[2:12:30] <+vaultzombie> Why do people get happy seeing others upset? I don't think it's out of the question to be slightly salty at a bad faith argument
[2:12:30] <%falconcrunchv2> grunts or jackals fam?
[2:12:31] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> that man had TWO SWORDS
[2:12:32] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4 all these red names in chat

[2:13:07] <ChernoMuncho> we got the hunters, hell yeah!
[2:13:12] <herzogtheanimal> I mean he literally did a voice depicting people of a certain opinion as being retarded
[2:13:14] <LoganPayne> I love that guy wanting to impress Arby

[2:13:30] <%a_goth_pancake> of course. why can't both be good? the old plays to my nostalgia, the years I spent on halo 2. the new represent how far halo 2 has come; remained so popular, so relevant to this day that a studio would devote time and resources to bring it into the current console generation. the old graphics are nothing to sneeze at, but the new graphics look phenomenal.
[2:13:32] <The_Swedish_X> no one say who got worms
[2:13:32] <+Estuko> The Elites walk a little crouched the way they do is due to the weight of their immense cocks underneath them

[2:13:51] <+shapeforn> @herzogtheanimal ...you can't be serious
[2:13:52] <%MacabreOpus> @Jaysky I agree, as lavish as the Blur cutscenes are, I've agreed with V & Woolie that sometimes it's almost impossible to see in certain dark areas as the dynamic range of the game engine can not handle HDR-like lighting scenarios, the latitude simply isn't there. Flattening the shadows and contrast has helped their gameplay be more enjoyable, at the cost of expensive graphical flair
[2:13:52] <jamesthebrave> Betrayal!
[2:13:55] <+Kqha4000> team kill +1
[2:13:57] <BurdRightsActivist> of course. why can't both be good? the old plays to my nostalgia, the years I spent on halo 2. the new represent how far halo 2 has come; remained so popular, so relevant to this day that a studio would devote time and resources to bring it into the current console generation. the old graphics are nothing to sneeze at, but the new graphics look phenomenal.

[2:15:13] <Catpurrple> That we can play with both graphics instead of only one is good, and it means there's nothing to be gained with this dumbassery. Now shut up.

[2:16:52] <mybigmeech> @estuko I raise you the argument that the honor guard elites have nicer armor
[2:16:54] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Oh boy Brutes got nerfed for Halo 3
[2:16:56] <%MacabreOpus> woolieFUN
[2:16:57] <+Estuko> @LiquidDinosaur it's like nude vs sexy clothing, show everything gives othing to imagination, but wear something appealing and revealing and you get to enjoy it more
[2:16:58] <+Creggamonsta> sheild armor is 2 fancy for grunts
[2:17:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @umbrellaswereawesome wait what

[2:17:04] <BritishTyrannosaur> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug a person of culture. excellent
[2:17:08] <pochecito> Is Woolie gonna play through the entire collection? or is he gonna take a break after halo 2?

[2:17:12] <brian_peppers1> @LiquidDinosaur It's an abomination indeed
[2:17:12] <Dean_Inbetween> I always protect my allies this level so by the end you have a huge ass squad of elites with snipers and grunts with rocket launchers

[2:17:30] <DSD24> @TheDandyGuy This is on Heroic
[2:17:32] <umbrellaswereawesome> @cobalt_phoenix_ The Elites don't consider most of them worth the cost of giving shields to.

[2:17:34] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The Cole Protocol dictates that you must watch the cutscenes in 2004 graphics

[2:19:20] <%raven_frame> The book was made after.

[2:19:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> i was here for the beginning donation thing
[2:19:24] <BurdRightsActivist> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug A better question would be, do you think Elites are good at sucking? Like how do you think those mandibles feel
[2:19:26] <%krispen_wa> So It was writen Before, good to know
[2:19:29] <brachydios777> @dsd24 Nope
[2:19:29] <%a_goth_pancake> it came out when I was in high school, so around 2010ish?
[2:19:35] <+MessyBristles> @TheShisno the book was so good that it made Halo: Reach disappointing to me
[2:19:36] <Ray326> He blew up a nade on the ground

[2:19:46] <buster7800> do elites have cloacas?
[2:19:46] <+smikeye> grunts are pressed into service on both sides
[2:19:46] <subjectg> @estuko aww, really? I like the closed helmet design. I like the spec ops elites in reach too for that reason
[2:19:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> whatever
[2:19:47] <+Jaysky> I'm assuming it's cause elites treat them with a bit more respect
[2:19:48] <+Estuko> @mybigmeech oh absolutely yes, I'm into that type of helmet, it also reminds me of the Praetorian Aliens too
[2:19:48] <+CyanDeadEye> @krispen_wa Chronologically the the beginning but published after Halo 2
[2:19:48] <nothuzad> also the brutes just eat about anything
[2:19:49] <derap41> i think they prefer not being food
[2:19:49] <Nevflinn> Grunts and Elites. Name a better bromance
[2:19:54] <Daxte_> i prefer horny chat over essay chat
[2:19:55] <huskarl_zap> WHEN THE fuck did noble become a spartan 3 instead of 2?
[2:19:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's been some pissy people in chat today
[2:19:58] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @firemane1279 hell yeah brother KappaPride
[2:19:59] <Who_lio42> I saw a 2nd needlert
[2:20:01] <%DensityD> it takes 2 to make a thing go right
[2:20:04] <TheChucklingOak> spoilers again yay
[2:20:06] <dinnydanny777> lol I got an ad for Picard
[2:20:07] <DSD24> I think its more "Which side has Jackals to kill?"
[2:20:08] <BritishTyrannosaur> He was a 3 the entire time dude
[2:20:10] <%Slimshazbot> he's always been a Spartan 3
[2:20:15] <Joestar1890> Nice!
[2:20:15] <BritishTyrannosaur> Only 2 was Jorge
[2:20:22] <+lupus_man> @huskarl_zap noble was always made up of Spartan 3
[2:20:23] <%Slimshazbot> the only Spartan 2 I. reach was jorge
[2:20:25] <mybigmeech> @captainpiledriver V insulted people's nostaly and chat responded in essays
[2:20:26] <+TheShisno> Noble 6 was always a Spartan 3, it's like a cheaper Spartan 2 literally meant to trade lives for time
[2:20:26] <%ChoculaUltra> I always thought fuel rods looked delicious. Don't judge me.
[2:20:28] <brachydios777> @huskarl_zap Only one spartan 2
[2:20:29] <%krispen_wa> Do you think Cortana changes her model to fully nude when in private with John Halo?
[2:20:29] <$QueequegTheater> My guiding Fuel Rod
[2:20:29] <huskarl_zap> Bruh in the Annoucment trailer they called him a 2
[2:20:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fall of Reach came out like 1 or 2 weeks before Combat Evolved
[2:20:32] <Dean_Inbetween> The elites are loyal to there commanders they’re used to like most troops also the brutes are much more harsh commanders and have no tact for there subordinates FrankerZ
[2:20:40] <Dean_Inbetween> The grunts i mean
[2:20:42] <TheChucklingOak> Hey hows about we not talk about a game that's not anywhere near being played yet?
[2:20:42] <DSD24> I thought Cortana was always nude
[2:20:44] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:20:44] <BritishTyrannosaur> Unless you vount the 2 seconds of Chief at the end of reach lol

[2:20:51] <dinnydanny777> The grunts would launch the white phosphorous
[2:20:58] <+lupus_man> Jorge is a special case for noble team in that he’s a 2
[2:20:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> JEEEEEEENKIIINS
[2:21:01] <$QueequegTheater> @DSD24 I bet she has attachments
[2:21:02] <MyNameIsRasus> At least he had chimkin

[2:21:20] <Dean_Inbetween> I loove the spec ops jet black on the grunts and elites in halo 1 @estuko
[2:21:28] <alrobot2014> even brutes can appreciate a shotty
[2:21:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 they'd get some burns maybe but they'd just be breathing their ice cold fart gas and be fine
[2:21:29] <LoganPayne> That brute was holding the shotgun sideways
[2:21:30] <+TheShisno> Oh yeah, Brutes LOVE human guns
[2:21:31] <+smikeye> out of ammo
[2:21:33] <ashenjuan25> The arbiter of that time did seem to respect the Unggoy of the time too so there’s not as much animosity between the two races despite the Sengheli glassing their planet
[2:21:35] <%Asuterisuku> Which is weird, because the Bruts have their OWN shotguns.
[2:21:37] <%a_goth_pancake> POW chick chick
[2:21:38] <$serpenttucker> Maulers were not introduced in this game
[2:21:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Them apes are fond of our ballistics
[2:21:40] <+smikeye> oh woolie's least favorite gun, the covenant carbine
[2:21:42] <%falconcrunchv2> yoo random fact for yall in chat if speedrunning the level the end is right around here
[2:21:44] <DSD24> Brutes with Shotguns
[2:21:44] <Joestar1890> Little heretical, don't you think Brutes?
[2:21:46] <duskrush> I thought it was a bug the first time I saw a brute with a human gun
[2:21:46] <%DensityD> SPEEN
[2:21:49] <umbrellaswereawesome> Primate appreciate primate.
[2:21:52] <GoogleyGareth> One day he'll see the flashing no ammo icon chat, one day LUL
[2:21:55] <The_Swedish_X> Brutes like power. Don't care who made it.
[2:21:59] <+yhom_tork> brutes love physical weapons, not of that pussy plasma shit
[2:22:01] <Bigyanno> having just played through everything that's out on the PC MCC on legendary I can safely say that Woolie is going to have a blast when he plays Halo 3
[2:22:03] <+Estuko> @Dean_Inbetween it's a good look on them and I like how it holds and shows of what they're here for.
[2:22:03] <mybigmeech> @captainpiledriver Yeah, V said "people really prefer this" while watching one using the old graphics

[2:23:38] <huskarl_zap> @liquiddinosaur I dont even understand that question and I'm a Tzeench Sorceror Lord
[2:23:41] <MrHappyFunshine> Brutes tend to have a "If it works" mentality, they also loved trolling elites with impractical designs.
[2:23:42] <TheChucklingOak> They did a really good job with the remastered music
[2:23:48] <kulmoth> big betrayal energy

[2:24:23] <+Estuko> @Dean_Inbetween They fuck
[2:24:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> I remember early vids of modded Halo with an AR that fired plasma grenades, a plasma grenade that made 3 more until it crashed, and a pistol that made Chief clones that move in sync.
[2:24:34] <%DensityD> but there is more birds chirping in the trees in classic mode
[2:24:35] <%krispen_wa> Wait, is there no music in the classic?
[2:24:40] <subjectg> @estuko of course, i need the money for it first!
[2:24:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Estuko nvm it s a joke my firends and i have had so long fromt he game i forgot its not an actual joke and just a dumb inside one. its from VIktor saying LIKE SIGMAR, WE ASCEND
[2:24:45] <%DensityD> why are there birds on a forerunner instalation?
[2:24:47] <+maenos2> @krispen_wa more subdued
[2:24:47] <BritishTyrannosaur> butt rock
[2:24:49] <zocano> largely prefer classic music, remastered is just so... over orchestrated?
[2:24:50] <Halospaz117> @krispen_wa Nah it's just quieter in classic for some reason
[2:24:50] <MyNameIsRasus> I fucking love buttrock
[2:24:52] <Catpurrple> There is music, it's less intense, maybe a little quieter in general

[2:24:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Estuko and then ofc just the usual STAIRS GO UP
[2:24:56] <+TheShisno> There is music, but they're playing mainly remastered which has different mixing
[2:24:59] <%MacabreOpus> @DensityD Birds are for SCALE

[2:26:37] <+Sp3ctre48> I wish these songs would loop instead of just turning off when they're done
[2:26:38] <+Estuko> @subjectg i you're looking for a job, what most Costcos are doing is they're hiring people in groups for 90 days and keeping them. I don't know if they're still doing the hazard pay which totals your pay to $17/hr, Sundays bcome $25/hr, and overtime is $22/hr. I'd call and ask about it to increase your chances
[2:26:38] <%M3djedx> woolieGASM
[2:26:39] <dinnydanny777> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug I meant the game has animals roaming around

[2:27:12] <%M3djedx> Do a barrel roll
[2:27:13] <Bigyanno> The one thing I really hate about the plasma sniper in this game is the overheat animation covers like 1/3rd of the screen in the anniversary ed
[2:27:16] <%krispen_wa> Oni's main protag had dumb hair
[2:27:20] <TimetodiveLTX> tfw can't grind in halo

[2:28:21] <MajoraZ> @Bigyanno are you using centered oir lowered crosshairs? Some guns, especially in Reach, have giant viewmodels in centered because 2/3/ODST/Reac/4 were made with lowered crosshairs originally and 343 just added in a centered option for PC which is set to default, but then raises the gun models
[2:28:21] <+Creggamonsta> almost stuck him

[2:31:09] <MajoraZ> I mean, WOULDN'T Brutes like shotguns? Seems like the sort of gun they would like
[2:31:12] <Joestar1890> @ashenjuan25 I'm just saying bruddah, what have the elites recently done for us?
[2:31:14] <huskarl_zap> It takes three or four shots to kill a brute with a shotgun
[2:31:16] <Dean_Inbetween> Also considering plasma deteriorates chiefs shield I’d imagine he’d feel the plasma venting from the gun burning his hand to some extent
[2:31:16] <%DensityD> V IS SO TALENTED
[2:31:17] <sniffy77> Oh hey terminal
[2:31:20] <+OneGorillionDollars> i like to think brutes loved shotguns so much they made their own as maulers in halo 3

[2:35:43] <brachydios777> Fun fact: Elites vouched for Humanity joining the Covenant before the war
[2:35:44] <umbrellaswereawesome> @Dean_Inbetween Relative to the Prophets, but they were already establishing space colonies before they joined the Covenant.
[2:35:55] <+yhom_tork> scorpion is better
[2:35:55] <lexcorphr> helmet of gaslighting
[2:35:56] <vincerocmm> give him the dunce hat of honor
[2:35:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dean_Inbetween and IIRC after Halo 3 they're like "oh fuck....it's been like 3000 years since we had to like....grow food....huh.. Shit."
[2:36:00] <%RunningNGunning> No turret in 2
[2:36:05] <%ChoculaUltra> Idk, but getting a job promotion but also seeing all the other people who held the same position in a room full of glass coffins isn't exactly morale boosting LUL
[2:36:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> boo
[2:36:10] <%a_goth_pancake> not til 3
[2:36:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine taking the Mandalore helmet and downgrading it into a dumb honor-suicide hat for your political machinations.
[2:36:12] <razieltano123> Abandon reason! Know only war!
[2:36:13] <Dorkoblin> Arbiters being a "shamed yet honourable death seeker" reminds me of slayer dwarfs from warhammer fantasy.
[2:36:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dean_Inbetween "How does one file taxes? We just had grunts do that"
[2:36:16] <+Bonerlord911> RELOAD YOUR GUNS

[2:36:22] <+smikeye> real mad how few shells the Halo 3 shotgun holds
[2:36:23] <+Estuko> I hope your dick is ENORMOUS Arbiter!
[2:36:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:36:26] <$QueequegTheater> It's so good
[2:36:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> "BITCH I KILLED 1 BILLION HUMANS"
[2:36:32] <IndoorSitup> It always bugged me that you can't use the Plasma Turrets on Wraiths in this game
[2:36:35] <%DensityD> @WoolieVersus was the thing you forgot related to "Brutes collect human shotguns"?
[2:36:41] <Dean_Inbetween> @umbrellaswereawesome oh really? Oh yeh they did have forrunner tech too, how did the elites lose then? LUL
[2:36:43] <%morgantj> He speaks from the heart
[2:36:43] <TheChucklingOak> "No Johns, Arbiter"
[2:36:44] <%Firststrike_OW> The idle dialogue in 3 is the best
[2:36:48] <+smikeye> woolie is so down to betray any number of humans for a race all about that big honor
[2:36:50] <3rdRunner> Reach, you say?
[2:36:52] <ashenjuan25> This why vadamee becomes the best character though

[2:36:58] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[2:37:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> @thechucklingoak that's the idea LUL
[2:37:07] <Halospaz117> The elites were attacked first
[2:37:14] <+smikeye> the prophets don't believe it's fake
[2:37:15] <dinnydanny777> You don't question the Spanish Inquisition Woolie, they only question you.
[2:37:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> brutes are overthrowing the elites
[2:37:17] <%ringabal> "Can't be a war crime if we make it a religion."
[2:37:22] <+smikeye> they think they will be ascending
[2:37:23] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> arbiter kinda has an idea a little bit because he fought the heretics
[2:37:24] <%a_goth_pancake> elite genocide
[2:37:25] <umbrellaswereawesome> @Dean_Inbetween Basically, the Elites actually didn't reverse-engineer Forerunner tech for the most part before the Prophets came.
[2:37:33] <%Slimshazbot> you wiped out the heretics
[2:37:38] <Dean_Inbetween> @umbrellaswereawesome oooh..okay thanks
[2:37:39] <dinnydanny777> If you don't want to die horribly in disgrace don't question the religion
[2:37:39] <%RioGascar> Its a massive schism
[2:37:40] <Halospaz117> Yeah that faction is done

[2:37:43] <%MasterMushin> NotLikeThis
[2:37:44] <%raven_frame> They're done, we killed them.
[2:37:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @derap41 meanwhile the ONI is sabotaging elite industry and stuff

[2:46:17] <subjectg> the snares are more meaty in the og game i feel
[2:46:18] <%DensityD> the reason the old shotgun could hold 60 shells total was because of a feature of the Mk 4, and now Master Chief is in a Mk 6 Mjolnir, or something right?

[2:49:19] <Dean_Inbetween> Its supposed to be excruciatingly painful because you are kept alive so it can link with your spinal collumn and tap into your brain and memories @choculaultra
[2:49:21] <dinnydanny777> Should there not be a massive pit of dead Covenant down there with these no railings
[2:49:22] <%xcompleasedad> I'm so SAD
[2:49:22] <IndoorSitup> Woolie has a bad case of Tunnel Vision.

[2:49:46] <+Buzzkill983> This is why OSHA recommends railings
[2:49:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur That is dono-message worthy.

[2:50:11] <Bigyanno> I could swear those are needler crystals in the sniper rifle
[2:50:13] <SoaringLettuce> why do so many of the best games ever have so many terrible rooms?
[2:50:17] <+Fenrein> Chat, would you rather be headcrabbed or flood assimilated?
[2:50:25] <subjectg> Iirc this place is called the “Hall of Tears” or something like that

[2:50:38] <+armor_kuma> @WoolieVersus ceiling lore
[2:50:39] <+yhom_tork> flood
[2:50:41] <%DensityD> plasma bad, bullets good against flood
[2:50:42] <%krispen_wa> If I get flood assimilated I get to suffer with everyone else assimilated with me rather than suffering alone
[2:50:44] <privatecorgi> At least flood i can be a part of a cool hive mind
[2:50:46] <%krispen_wa> so Flod
[2:50:48] <Bigyanno> HALO JUMP. HALO JUMP
[2:50:50] <+keviniscool> at least the flood is powerfull, being headcrab is just sad
[2:50:50] <halfmasks> run away!
[2:50:50] <SoaringLettuce> like, Jesus, re4 has some bad ones too
[2:50:50] <BritishTyrannosaur> I mean with the flood your consciousness and memories live for a while

[2:51:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton the wiki says that was a misconception and technically not true but fuck it im posting this anyway because it SHOULD be canon. Apparently "Step of Silence" is a timestamp thing
[2:51:28] <+mechatengu21> teaching wooloo the footsies of fps
[2:51:29] <Joestar1890> Bad idea to get rid of that shotgun
[2:51:33] <BritishTyrannosaur> Your listening to Truth FM

[2:51:37] <Torivore> Flood, then maybe I'll get to hear more from Gravemind's poetry jam

[2:51:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 1 minute
[2:51:48] <Saffry_Ruzin> Mendicant Bias!
[2:51:51] <Louie_Salmon> Almost every time V has said to run, Woolie has stopped in the middle of all enemies to shoot one of them
[2:51:54] <+CptBritches> When he says "run run get away" I don't think that means he wanted to stay and fight lol
[2:51:58] <+Fenrein> @Torivore yeah that seems like a decent use of time lol
[2:52:10] <%a_goth_pancake> oh good, finally something for her to do 😒
[2:52:11] <halfmasks> watch woolie headshot v
[2:52:21] <huskarl_zap> Rolland Bias? Kappa
[2:52:24] <+yhom_tork> SHUTGUN
[2:52:29] <brachydios777> Oh yeah Mendican Bias would be on high charitiy
[2:52:49] <%a_goth_pancake> Rolland looks like a little aviator, he's so adorable
[2:52:50] <+markypoo4L> woolie omg
[2:52:50] <$jake5713> Gotta leave. Stay cool and finish the fight, boys.
[2:52:50] <+leviting> wait, wasn't mendicant bias killed by offensive bias?
[2:52:51] <IndoorSitup> Woolie...
[2:52:52] <Joestar1890> LUL
[2:52:53] <+CptBritches> You kept the empty sniper...
[2:52:56] <Bigyanno> The good news is we've spawned all the drones. The bad news is WE'VE SPAWNED ALL THE DRONES
[2:53:02] <subjectg> oh woolie
[2:53:06] <Saffry_Ruzin> the presence Cortana mentioned is Mendicant Bias
[2:53:08] <brachydios777> @leviting He was imprisoned
[2:53:23] <zocano> a fragment of Mendicant was splintered and contained on the forerunner dreadnaught
[2:53:24] <%a_goth_pancake> and then you learn ai can have clothes and Cortana is just fetishist.
[2:53:24] <TheChucklingOak> Shhhhutup with the spoilers chat
[2:53:34] <subjectg> he’s in here, but mayhaps that’s a discussion for 3, yeah?
[2:53:38] <huskarl_zap> is.it.really?
[2:53:40] <+CptBritches> :)
[2:53:43] <subjectg> kinda?
[2:53:46] <dinnydanny777> Cortana choose that outfit because she likes John
[2:53:49] <BritishTyrannosaur> tbh mendicant is side story
[2:53:51] <dinnydanny777> I bet
[2:53:51] <%krispen_wa> Cortana is soo fucking hot man
[2:53:52] <Saffry_Ruzin> Woolie's never going to learn about Mendicant Bias unless he plays on Legendary
[2:53:59] <huskarl_zap> you only.see the name in a timed text file
[2:54:03] <Saffry_Ruzin> because that final terminal
[2:54:06] <+smikeye> iirc in the book it was specifically mentioned she chose Halsey's face to mess with her, and appears naked to bother people
[2:54:06] <%krispen_wa> Goddamn I wish I could have my own hot snarky AI

[2:54:12] <+yhom_tork> flashlight
[2:54:13] <sniffy77> Reminder that Medicant Bias did everything wrong
[2:54:14] <+maenos2> cortana is just oedipal issues writ so.

[2:54:26] <+Msytic6> Would you say a... Woolie bait?
[2:54:28] <TheChucklingOak> And who cares if he learns about him? Also, do you guys realize that there's other newcomers to the franchise now as well thanks to Woolie?
[2:54:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> Again, technically i lied but screw it that SHOULD be true that typo should not have been a typo, that should be the name of the room
[2:54:28] <+CptBritches> WOOLIE JESUS
[2:54:28] <+smikeye> oh yeah, cortana a real momcon and brocon

[2:54:47] <$serpenttucker> Woolie now "accidentely" shooting him
[2:54:53] <+CptBritches> Woolie should NEVER be allowed to join any military. He would destroy his own unit by instinct
[2:54:57] <+xerotwo> NEW ZOMBIE
[2:54:59] <Torivore> Cortana and the other AIs are vocaloids, think about it

[2:55:15] <Bigyanno> there is a sword in the previous room too

[2:55:20] <+Freeborg1997> I just realized you can basically just cheap your way through the hardest difficulty in co-op. Just have one guy hide, while the other fights and dies a million times.

[2:55:20] <%ChoculaUltra> now I want a Kizuna Ai Cortana mod LUL

[3:00:47] <%krispen_wa> did not know that taka was a fan of the Versus Woolie

[3:01:16] <%a_goth_pancake> and now the gate has been unlatched
[3:01:18] <+smikeye> how would you not expect that monstor to not betray you?
[3:01:20] <Nevflinn> Can't call it a betrayal if he was never on your side. But yeah, Gravemind is awesome
[3:01:21] <Goraka91> Villains are only good if they're interesting
[3:01:21] <Halospaz117> Can't betray you if he was never on your side
[3:01:22] <seniormeatbox> GIANT FLOOD STALKS
[3:01:22] <LoganPayne> Satan betrayed you and you're bummed?
[3:01:25] <Jrockoni> @liquiddinosaur regret died and gravemind consumed him. so either he pulled him out specifically because he knew what he would say to manipulate the situation, or he just made him say what he wanted to fuck with the arbiter cause he knew it would work.
[3:01:26] <anrexor> You looked at gravemind and thought this guy is an ally?
[3:01:26] <%cowardman93> yes
[3:01:26] <+Buzzkill983> Curse your predictable, yet untimely betrayal!
[3:01:27] <voodoolawyer> Gravemind catfishes the universe
[3:01:28] <+RowenCleric> can the gravemind... move? or is he like stuck in the ground
[3:01:29] <%krispen_wa> So if Gravemind has an orgasm, does EVERYONE feel it?
[3:01:31] <dinnydanny777> Gravemind : The Forerunners died.

[3:01:51] <The_Swedish_X> I tend to book it even on heroic
[3:01:58] <+Estuko> @krispen_wa I hope so
[3:02:00] <MajoraZ> @RowenCleric It's the flood hivemind so it doesn't need to. If the flood forms another gravemind somewhere else ever at any time it inherits the same conciounesses
[3:02:05] <dinnydanny777> I think the Gravemind isn't a being so much as it is a place
[3:02:09] <+Freeborg1997> Aren't Graveminds just more advanced forms of flood? So aren't there tons of those giant tentacle worm guys?
[3:02:12] <dellis80> I kill everyone LUL
[3:02:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Jrockoni Regret would say everything he'd say though. Remember even if they know humans are Chosen, the Prophets DO believe in the Great Journey or they would't be trying to do it
[3:02:15] <Dean_Inbetween> Your religion is a lie and assimilation is the end nature of all things so why fight it

[3:02:26] <voodoolawyer> the Gravemind is a collection of all flood - the smallest piece of flood is gravemind

[3:02:31] <%DensityD> can't fool me again
[3:02:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Freeborg23 they need to consume a certain amount of biomass and enough smart people to have a gravemind

[3:02:57] <+Freeborg1997> That grunt did nothing :(
[3:02:58] <%Gruhunchously> That grunt just ran at you like he wanted to give you a hug. And you shot him
[3:02:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Freeborg23 they didnt hae enough time on Halo CE to make a Gravemind yet but the blob Keyes is in was a proto-gravemind

[3:03:17] <+TheShisno> The Covenant is just America
[3:03:17] <derap41> The Flood is the journey you idiot
[3:03:17] <LoganPayne> Owned, flamingo
[3:03:18] <Louie_Salmon> Thinking about it now, how does Woolie feel comfortable with character action/fighting games and the massive movelist there, but overwhelmed by weapon switching and ammo?
[3:03:20] <+markypoo4L> MELEE WOOLIE
[3:03:22] <subjectg> This room ain’t so bad if you let them fight
[3:03:25] <+markypoo4L> USE THE MELEE
[3:03:28] <+markypoo4L> PLS MELEE
[3:03:29] <dinnydanny777> The Flood did nothing wrong.
[3:03:30] <Dean_Inbetween> No
[3:03:32] <+leviting> was that a brute flood?
[3:03:38] <+yhom_tork> why did they change truth's VA in 3? NotLikeThis
[3:03:38] <dinnydanny777> :)
[3:03:41] <Dean_Inbetween> That wont work unless you got a sword
[3:03:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @leviting not in Halo 2 no
[3:03:42] <%a_goth_pancake> not til 3
[3:03:43] <DianaTheAscian> i forget how this game ends tbh
[3:03:44] <stachystat> Striiiiiiike
[3:03:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @markypoo4l He needs a shower man
[3:03:46] <+markypoo4L> shotgun and melee
[3:03:47] <huskarl_zap> apparently the flood has a thing against manlets because they spare Grunts
[3:03:50] <Bigyanno> melee is the answer IF YOU HAVE A SWORD
[3:03:51] <LoganPayne> halo 3 flood explode to melee. they're made of dust
[3:03:53] <voodoolawyer> When I was a child, the Plasma Rifle melee did more damage. I'm sure the same logic can apply here.
[3:03:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @louie_salmon probably because hes been playing the former for a decade and the latter for a month
[3:03:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The Flood are just hungry
[3:03:57] <subjectg> @yeeter_baelish va declined to return, they had no choice
[3:03:58] <+Creggamonsta> he didnt grow up playin fps. so hes not useto spmaing reload
[3:03:58] <%NovaKnightmare> @yeeter_baelish the original VA declined to return
[3:04:00] <balquisa> CA AIM
[3:04:02] <TheChucklingOak> Truth's VA from 2 chose not to reprise the role
[3:04:02] <%korth367> that woolie aim
[3:04:04] <brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 You know, except the whole consuming all of life thing
[3:04:05] <samuelfisk> Truth is such a scumbug but he is smooth.
[3:04:07] <Dean_Inbetween> Shotgun and melee do nothing to brutes or flood in halo 2
[3:04:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> @LoganPayne i dont like that change tbh
[3:04:08] <Jrockoni> @liquiddinosaur right, I'm just saying the fact that regret was there was 100% gravemind manipulation. it wasn't like he just showed up. which shows how fuckin devious gravemind is. getting a perfect strawman to make him look like the reasonable one
[3:04:09] <IndoorSitup> Nice aim.
[3:04:11] <%a_goth_pancake> LUL
[3:04:11] <+maenos2> spray and pray
[3:04:19] <Dean_Inbetween> Just shotgun
[3:04:24] <adre354> get your shotgun back
[3:04:24] <bubbajoe117> @TheChucklingOak I find that a massive shame too cause he was just so good
[3:04:25] <seniormeatbox> @voodoolawyer to me it was the plasma pistol, but that was probably because it punched the fastest
[3:04:26] <%krispen_wa> so when gravemind inevitably takes over the universe...what does he do then? like fap for eternity because nothing else exists?
[3:04:26] <dellis80> who mastered dodging the back attack?
[3:04:27] <GoogleyGareth> @Creggamonsta and he started with doom 2016 so even less reason to lol
[3:04:29] <Bigyanno> I wonder if the prophets wear boxers or briefs
[3:04:32] <%Gruhunchously> That's an image right there
[3:04:34] <adre354> its somewhere in the room
[3:04:35] <%DensityD> bible black panties
[3:04:35] <LoganPayne> @LiquidDinosaur makes as much sense as brute armor exploding to plasma pistol emp
[3:04:36] <dinnydanny777> @brachydios777 It's all perspective really, from the flood's point of view they're just prolonging their existence

[3:04:48] <+Ropcord> they probably wear weird bodysuits like mormons

[3:04:52] <BritishTyrannosaur> Gravemind elgit just wants revenge on the galaxy. for spolery reasons
[3:04:55] <huskarl_zap> @krispen_wa its spoilers on what would happen
[3:04:55] <voodoolawyer> when Gravemind wins the universe, there are no longer threats to Gravemind. Gravemmind will flourish and prosper
[3:04:57] <TheChucklingOak> Yeah, no idea why the guy didn't want to continue the role. Maybe he got a movie deal or he had personal stuff, who knows?
[3:04:57] <+Creggamonsta> dont most mondern shooters just reload for you all the time.
[3:04:57] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @krispen_wa maybe he starves and life starts anew
[3:04:58] <IndoorSitup> Yeah High Charity is FUCKED

[3:06:11] <%Feralspirit41> There are female elites but they arent allowed to fight
[3:06:12] <Torivore> Female elite in Legends was kinda hot tbh
[3:06:14] <yusefHD> HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys VoteYea
[3:06:15] <The_Swedish_X> Might be a male oriented military
[3:06:15] <+smikeye> there female sanghelli on a book cover got a nice bootie
[3:06:16] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[3:06:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Reach :(
[3:06:17] <Nevflinn> IIRC female Elites are all warriors, they bodyguard the homeworld
[3:06:19] <%paladinstarbuster> female elites are small
[3:06:20] <+Creggamonsta> this is new to the remaster right?
[3:06:20] <thesoldierofjoy> yeah, there is one in some of the later games and books
[3:06:23] <Shardlab> Female Jackals are around. And they're vicious
[3:06:24] <+YabbaTroll> you fight female jackals sometimes
[3:06:25] <DigitalJoshie> no big titty Brute GF :(
[3:06:27] <huskarl_zap> because they have standards
[3:06:27] <%a_goth_pancake> not every race is sexually dimorphic, woolz.
[3:06:28] <%Gruhunchously> Nice transition
[3:06:29] <%DensityD> "A MERE SCRIBE"
[3:06:33] <phantalime> halo legends had an elite lady but not covenant
[3:06:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...but
[3:06:35] <Halospaz117> Wait is this not Regret?
[3:06:38] <dinnydanny777> Don't you hate it when someone desecrates your sacred ring?
[3:06:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> who's talking
[3:06:42] <turbofolk> The covenant military and religious heads dont allow females in general
[3:06:43] <derap41> You're just a dick
[3:06:45] <huskarl_zap> we arent on 4 yet
[3:06:45] <lotharrio> Hunters are asexual, I think.
[3:06:46] <dinnydanny777> It's just, terrible
[3:06:49] <%Gruhunchously> Regret?
[3:06:52] <%DensityD> woof, high score
[3:06:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> Jackals are matriarchal
[3:07:01] <TheChucklingOak> I just assume this is Regret's brother or something, because he sounds so similar
[3:07:02] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @dinnydanny777 the arbiter can desecrate my sacred ring any time
[3:07:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> "Abolish the elite race"
[3:07:04] <voodoolawyer> Which terminal talks about the Number that ticks down every time the Arbiter uses a piece of his demonic magic power?
[3:07:05] <+TheShisno> Yeah it's not Regret, even though it's his actor from Wars
[3:07:06] <%chiluzza> a good old fashioned race war it looks like
[3:07:07] <%DensityD> "I would never...."
[3:07:08] <derap41> @turbofolk need them to make more soldiers
[3:07:09] <+Creggamonsta> Hunters are a mass of lil bugs in a suit from what i recal
[3:07:09] <+yhom_tork> ABOLISHED
[3:07:10] <%DensityD> LUL
[3:07:12] <LoganPayne> Abolish a people? I think there's a word for that
[3:07:13] <%Gruhunchously> I would never...
[3:07:13] <DatAsuna> but
[3:07:18] <duskrush> Why would he stay loyal?!
[3:07:21] <haitakaa> not all species are sexually dimorphic
[3:07:21] <squidmax1> Halo Wars brute there!
[3:07:22] <derap41> Its 2.5D
[3:07:24] <dinnydanny777> I would never, but I'm going to anyway
[3:07:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> @LoganPayne Elites are permabanned
[3:07:32] <Goraka91> Big honour
[3:07:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> VADEMY IS PISSED
[3:07:34] <+yhom_tork> hes cool tho
[3:07:36] <lotharrio> Big war crime boss.
[3:07:36] <dinnydanny777> What is this Lord of the Rings type name
[3:07:37] <huskarl_zap> WHAT About Whatinrey tho???? Kappa
[3:07:38] <wintrysoma> the whole great schism plot feels very convenient, like they realised there was no way for humanity to win without severely crippling the covies
[3:07:38] <%Solidnick18> sick
[3:07:38] <BritishTyrannosaur> Big redemprion
[3:07:39] <LeBlanc233> Big good guy
[3:07:42] <%korth367> he's got about the same kill count as chief
[3:07:42] <dinnydanny777> Fell Vadiner?
[3:07:42] <+Bonerlord911> vadamee
[3:07:47] <%a_goth_pancake> I fear no man... but, that Thel Vadamee...

[3:07:55] <+smikeye> you didn't "conquer" Arby just killed
[3:07:55] <FreedomARX7> warrior race
[3:07:56] <DianaTheAscian> no
[3:07:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> not to be confused with Vas Ectomy
[3:07:58] <lotharrio> "Nah, it's fine though."
[3:07:59] <%DensityD> Alien heads and hormones are different from human heads
[3:08:01] <%BisoromiBear> nah man, muh battle, muh honor. it's all good.
[3:08:01] <penitentpentwitch> "Make us whole, Isaac."
[3:08:02] <dinnydanny777> No because killing is good
[3:08:03] <+Buzzkill983> He got some good hits in. Humans in Halo are Mandos
[3:08:03] <LoganPayne> No you just immediately get blindingly angry at Truth
[3:08:05] <subjectg> this gets a whole lot more complicated when reach comes along
[3:08:05] <%krispen_wa> Your head just HONORS the death away
[3:08:06] <brachydios777> Some do
[3:08:07] <%MasterMushin> It doesnt. You just switch perspectives.
[3:08:07] <duskrush> warrior race so nah
[3:08:08] <kulmoth> they are warriors i don't think they care too much, they gave them a fight
[3:08:10] <dinnydanny777> Guilt is societal
[3:08:13] <TheChucklingOak> A million/billion is a statistic

[3:08:16] <voodoolawyer> He fights to atone for his guilt in KILLER INSTINCT
[3:08:17] <%MacabreOpus> Are we the baddies???
[3:08:18] <+Freeborg1997> @dinnydanny777 O_o
[3:08:19] <DianaTheAscian> honor in combat
[3:08:19] <The_Swedish_X> They are still warriors.
[3:08:20] <+That_Marcus_Dude> Lmao
[3:08:23] <%DensityD> "guilt and everything is just chemicals. but aliens have different chemicals"
[3:08:24] <%Gruhunchously> DO YOU FEEL LIKE A HERO YET?
[3:08:24] <drewslo> no, because elites still love the battle
[3:08:24] <cavefishes> what difficulty has woolie been playing on?
[3:08:26] <GoogleyGareth> Probably have different ideas about death.

[3:08:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp psaBig Number
[3:08:29] <dinnydanny777> Do you think people back in the day felt guilt over killing people?
[3:08:31] <+CptBritches> Yeah, but the Arbiter is Keith David so it's all forgiven
[3:08:32] <+JeluxDaCasual> DO YOU FEEL LIKE A HERO YET?!
[3:08:34] <BritishTyrannosaur> Arbiter kind of channels his guilt into revenge and rebuilding i guess. ne never really atone's i guess
[3:08:34] <+Creggamonsta> heroic
[3:08:35] <Bigyanno> HE fought honourably. His people didn't
[3:08:36] <Kain5707> Warf LUL
[3:08:37] <voodoolawyer> @cavefishes Normal I think, but Woolie Legendary
[3:08:38] <%The_Timo> Or is Guilt a human only problem
[3:08:41] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> guilt is a social construct, do you feel guilty for the million deaths when you step on an anthill?
[3:08:41] <thesoldierofjoy> In my head, the drive to move forward with fixing it would outweigh the guilt.
[3:08:42] <+TheShisno> You had a chance, you just suck
[3:08:43] <dinnydanny777> You think the Crusaders felt guilt?
[3:08:44] <DigitalJoshie> we gave you a warriors death
[3:08:45] <lotharrio> The politics were bad. But the WAR was pure. Don't blame the war.

[3:16:56] <MadBaller123> is there an aliean name for the covenant vehicles?
[3:17:01] <%Gruhunchously> @prime_name All human vehicles are named after animals, all covenant vehicles are named after supernatural things.

[3:26:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> based
[3:26:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> This feels like the shittiest retcon. What did you do 343?
[3:26:17] <$QueequegTheater> YOU FUCKING DUMBASS
[3:26:17] <+Buzzkill983> YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM?

[3:26:27] <LoganPayne> This is some prequel levels of everybody knew each other
[3:26:27] <SoaringLettuce> this is a terrible retcon
[3:26:28] <huskarl_zap> bungie never thought this up
[3:26:31] <Catpurrple> REALLY NOW

[3:26:38] <%krispen_wa> JUST TALK
[3:26:38] <$serpenttucker> FIRST
[3:26:40] <+Sp3ctre48> I guess the logic is that if Thel was made the Arbiter then he was already lost to the prophets
[3:26:41] <Ardyn_1zunia> THIS CUTSCENE WAS MADE BY 343
[3:26:41] <voodoolawyer> "If only I could talk to him. HOLD UP, WHO'S THIS SHINY FUCKER?"
[3:26:42] <$Rumbutt> EXCEPT YOU COULD AND YOU SHOT HIM
[3:26:42] <Torivore> Does he not know what his face looks like
[3:26:43] <%SashaStarshine> LUL Heretic is a dumbass

[3:26:44] <TheChucklingOak> BUT NOooooo. Get a load of this guy
[3:26:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Because he was the Arbiter and he knew he would follow his orders
[3:26:45] <+jeasybakeoven> such a fucking dumb retcon, nobody at any point considered this makes no sense
[3:26:47] <%a_goth_pancake> oh look, fragments of the ring.
[3:26:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> YOU'RE LITERALLY SAYING JUST TALK BUT THEN YOU DIDNT
[3:26:47] <trackles_64> When you feel for the bad guy

[3:26:49] <LoganPayne> Bad Retcon is bad
[3:26:51] <+Juriasu> oh ok
[3:26:54] <+CptBritches> Yeah this just makes the part of him shooting him even stupider lololol
[3:26:56] <+wunp_fxs> baaaad retcon
[3:26:57] <+smikeye> why would rando miner know about the ring?
[3:26:57] <DeepSearch27> He thought it was someone else maybe
[3:26:57] <%RadicalWeegee> My husbando couldnt have done this!
[3:26:57] <$QueequegTheater> THIS ONE SUCKS

[3:27:03] <voodoolawyer> Space Obito
[3:27:05] <bubbli97> dude fucking figured it out but still shot
[3:27:06] <Ardyn_1zunia> This cutscene was a stupid retcon by 343
[3:27:06] <+Jake_Protagonist> WHY?
[3:27:06] <The_Swedish_X> I know what they are going for, but I don’t care for this new lore.
[3:27:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @smikeye because its part of their religion?
[3:27:07] <%trueherobappo> I'm sooo late
[3:27:07] <Oscarthemowerman> wait and then he puts the logic together NotLikeThis
[3:27:08] <SoaringLettuce> THIS IS AWFUL
[3:27:09] <%Nomad94> Welp
[3:27:10] <%krispen_wa> WHAT
[3:27:10] <TheChucklingOak> of fuck off Refumee, you suck
[3:27:11] <KnivesEve> this is a 343 thing isnt
[3:27:13] <%BisoromiBear> If I could just talk to him I could immediately scrap this plan and shoot him for no reason
[3:27:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YOU FOOL
[3:27:14] <+JeluxDaCasual> Well, there you go
[3:27:15] <%Karkatstoaster> Oof I’m late How much did I miss cutscene wise

[3:27:17] <prime_name> This is some baaaaad Retcon
[3:27:17] <+glitch5000> This hurts
[3:27:18] <Goraka91> Really not a fan of this one
[3:27:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> IF ONLY I COULD TALK TO HIM
[3:27:20] <+yhom_tork> THERE YOU GO
[3:27:21] <%krispen_wa> THEN SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE
[3:27:21] <TimetodiveLTX> but you didn't even try?
[3:27:21] <+jeasybakeoven> awful explanation to try and cover bad retcon gg 343
[3:27:23] <+wunp_fxs> so this is not cannon to me la la la
[3:27:25] <DigitalJoshie> this is a super 343 thing
[3:27:25] <+Fenrein> So I shot him
[3:27:25] <%Gruhunchously> THERE'S NO TIME
[3:27:25] <voodoolawyer> I could write this speech with my ass
[3:27:27] <TheChucklingOak> HE did respond! He was listening!
[3:27:27] <turbofolk> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[3:27:27] <+pedrothecruel> BOOOOOO
[3:27:28] <%jiggy_snipe> THERE WAS NO TIME LULL
[3:27:29] <%DensityD> "just talk" x100
[3:27:31] <+Sp3ctre48> I kinda get it, but yeah this isn't a very fluid retcon
[3:27:33] <prince_johnny_> BOOOO
[3:27:34] <privatecorgi> No questions 4Head
[3:27:36] <%lioan515> IF ONLY I COULD TALK TO HIM, BUT NOT THO
[3:27:37] <derap41> You idiot
[3:27:38] <%xcompleasedad> NotLikeThis
[3:27:40] <Oscarthemowerman> a sample of the 343 writing
[3:27:42] <+yhom_tork> LUL
[3:27:43] <+Jake_Protagonist> him shooting him is only more stupid now
[3:27:43] <+phatmac16> This is dumb
[3:27:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE RIP INTO THIS IDIOT
[3:27:44] <turbofolk> NO TIME
[3:27:44] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Then I started blasting
[3:27:45] <+Blarghnox> there was no time
[3:27:45] <DianaTheAscian> does the heretic have a name?
[3:27:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[3:27:47] <@Menitta> people really lookin forward to Infinite
[3:27:49] <$QueequegTheater> LiTERALLY A POINTLESS RETCON
[3:27:49] <Catpurrple> You know when he could've talked to arbiter and everyone, with guilty spar? Behind the indestructible force field before arbiter cuts the wires
[3:27:50] <SoaringLettuce> this is AWFUUUUUUL
[3:27:51] <%GrumbleGrouse> k
[3:27:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Guys it’s really not that hard to understand, he knew Arbiter wouldn’t listen to him
[3:27:54] <+phatmac16> 343 WRITING
[3:27:54] <LoganPayne> Whhyyyyyyy
[3:27:54] <penitentpentwitch> The power of propaganda!
[3:27:55] <trackles_64> So Atriox doesnt exist yet?
[3:27:55] <TheChucklingOak> All these terminals do is make me hate REfumee more. He deserved everything
[3:27:56] <Ardyn_1zunia> Pointless retcon
[3:27:56] <Joestar1890> This retcon man...
[3:27:57] <huskarl_zap> @Menitta bruh
[3:27:58] <prime_name> BOO THIS RETCON
[3:27:59] <Dean_Inbetween> Someone talk about Xytan Wattinree the most badass elite who ever lived FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ
[3:28:02] <$QueequegTheater> WOOLIE WHAT
[3:28:03] <voodoolawyer> OMEGALUL
[3:28:03] <%Nomad94> Chat is being a baby
[3:28:06] <rosabellamelantha> 343 FUCKING SUCKS
[3:28:08] <+phatmac16> Boo rector
[3:28:10] <bubbajoe117> @DianaTheAscian Ripa Morimee or something like
[3:28:11] <%BisoromiBear> It's his own fault for being a big dumb
[3:28:12] <%Nomad94> Chat, stop being babies.
[3:28:13] <+phatmac16> DUMB RETCON
[3:28:14] <huskarl_zap> woolie doesnt know he wasnt there
[3:28:15] <%Firststrike_OW> Exactly
[3:28:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Catpurrple instead of saying "THE PROPHETS ARE LIARS" just broadcast video feeds of Guilty Spark talking
[3:28:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WTF Chat?
[3:28:21] <brachydios777> It’s fine chat
[3:28:22] <wintrysoma> ...good?
[3:28:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> @nomad94 No <3
[3:28:25] <ChernoMuncho> 343 is poopoo
[3:28:25] <Firemane1279> This is 343 retconning stuff.,
[3:28:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> OR HELL, RETCON IT SO ARBITER SHOOTS FIRST
[3:28:29] <brian_peppers1> WAAA Halo ruined WAAAA *sucks on finger*
[3:28:29] <LoganPayne> 343 can't write halo
[3:28:32] <+phatmac16> 343 is poop
[3:28:33] <%arkv01> THREEEE FOUR FREEEEEE
[3:28:39] <voodoolawyer> Space Obito, bro.
[3:28:39] <+Fenrein> So they knew he shot him and still added it
[3:28:40] <SoaringLettuce> were not being babies for calling out shitty writing
[3:28:40] <%Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur Arbiter shot first
[3:28:40] <%hattrick61> 343 STINKY
[3:28:41] <+TheShisno> Just TALK
[3:28:43] <%xcompleasedad> HA
[3:28:45] <dinnydanny777> The Covenant did nothing wrong
[3:28:46] <Goraka91> @LiquidDinosaur Fuck that would solve everything
[3:28:47] <BritishTyrannosaur> it's one terminal jesus christ
[3:28:47] <+Sp3ctre48> Nah this isnt a chat being babies thing, this retcon is really inconsistent with the game
[3:28:48] <bubbli97> just talk
[3:28:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously that would literaly fix the lothole
[3:28:49] <DigitalJoshie> it's not awful but it makes it a bit "really?"
[3:28:49] <%jiggy_snipe> he had the opportunity to just talk
[3:28:49] <TheChucklingOak> I don't mind 343, but this is actually a goddamn awful retcon
[3:28:50] <prince_johnny_> Yup
[3:28:52] <Joestar1890> JUST. TALK.
[3:28:53] <%krispen_wa> Chat is dumb huh? It's dumb now?
[3:28:56] <%Retinolgaming> Restored content mod LUL
[3:28:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @liquiddinosaur only if the heretic gets to say "Maclunky" first
[3:28:58] <%a_goth_pancake> BUT HE IS LOST TO OUR CAUSE
[3:28:58] <%Ryaotz> feels like a brute should have killed hime?
[3:28:59] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:29:01] <+phatmac16> Dumb retcon
[3:29:03] <%xcompleasedad> Chat trying to act like Woolie likes this horseshit LUL
[3:29:04] <ElectricHoodie> People complaining about people complaining is way worse
[3:29:04] <+TheShisno> Just talk but he already didn't Just Talk so what can you DO?
[3:29:05] <%jiggy_snipe> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[3:29:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously literally change it to Arby shot first. make it clear that Arbiter is not open to hearing the other opinion
[3:29:06] <subjectg> 343, you guys got heart, but that was a very bad lack of understanding your property
[3:29:06] <%Karkatstoaster> Imma Dip so I can watch the full thing from the beginning
[3:29:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Why is this so hard to understand, he knew the Arbiter wouldn’t have listened to him???
[3:29:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @krispen_wa always has been.not sure why at this moment though
[3:29:11] <+wunp_fxs> yep
[3:29:14] <+Juriasu> i mean that rebel guy was kind of an idiot who just happened to gain great knowledge he didn't know what to do with
[3:29:15] <bubbli97> just make Arbiter shoot
[3:29:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:29:16] <huskarl_zap> Why is that here?
[3:29:21] <TheChucklingOak> Even Woolie and V recognize that it was kinda weird
[3:29:21] <Goraka91> From my point of view Thel'vadame is dead!
[3:29:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> 343 retconning big shit
[3:29:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lewdskeletor13 Arbiter was like, lowering his gun to listen
[3:29:25] <+phatmac16> It’s dumb
[3:29:27] <%GrumbleGrouse> 343 big brain
[3:29:29] <+Blarghnox> arbiter would never have listened
[3:29:31] <%trueherobappo> trueherobappo subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[3:29:34] <brachydios777> In the end the problem is “just talk”
[3:29:37] <+wunp_fxs> yep totally agree V
[3:29:40] <%DomunDomunDomun> Chat mocking chat like it isn't chat.
[3:29:42] <+phatmac16> Just talk
[3:29:44] <%jiggy_snipe> @lewdskeletor13 the arbiter was gonna listen
[3:29:46] <drewslo> if arbiter shot first it would actually be a good retcon
[3:29:49] <TheChucklingOak> Arbiter WAS listening. The cutscene SHOWS IT
[3:29:49] <%DensityD> *big sigh* it's fine
[3:29:50] <+Blarghnox> just tall 4head
[3:29:51] <DigitalJoshie> like the build is good, but like "talk tho"
[3:29:51] <Ardyn_1zunia> V is right. Pointless and meaningless terminal.
[3:29:53] <%trueherobappo> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[3:29:54] <Kain5707> clone wars begs to differ :)
[3:29:55] <+smikeye> games are weakest part of Halo expanded lore
[3:29:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> THE ARBITER WAS LISTENING
[3:29:56] <kulmoth> everyone is a one guy
[3:29:58] <%RioGascar> 343 needs to tell everything
[3:30:02] <Nevflinn> They'd have to retcon the scene, so Arbiter either forces the Heretic to come or shoots
[3:30:06] <+TheShisno> Okay, chat, what should have happened? Cause the end was written in 2004, so what should have happened?
[3:30:10] <brachydios777> 343 can’t change Halo 2 guys
[3:30:12] <%doomerskeletor13> @liquiddinosaur Dude even after being betrayed by Tartarus and the Prophets he still believes in the sacred rings, he definitely would’ve still killed the Heretic
[3:30:12] <+phatmac16> The terminal is nice, but the scene of the heretic being dumb ruins it
[3:30:12] <%RioGascar> Which infinite is apparently axing a lot of shit
[3:30:12] <%a_goth_pancake> if someone had killed him and assumed power.
[3:30:13] <%GrumbleGrouse> HE DID
[3:30:13] <%dekkitout> Is the general consensus, "Too bad that guy's dead"
[3:30:14] <%DensityD> if we tell more, we can market more, and sell more
[3:30:14] <nothuzad> the chat was gonna lsien but the heretic opened fire because he probably thought he was "lost" idealogicaly
[3:30:15] <privatecorgi> If only I could talk to Arbiter. Too bad I'd have to kill him
[3:30:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> one theory I read was that he though Arbiter pre-arbiter would have listened, but then once he saw he was arbiter he thought he wouldn't listen
[3:30:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> people in chat making fun of chat is just the twin spider-men pointing at each othee
[3:30:20] <StarlitStunner> lytCRYA Chat hates Chat because Chat is Chat
[3:30:21] <+Sp3ctre48> It would've been fine with the Arbiter attacked him first, yeah
[3:30:22] <+phatmac16> BUT BOSS FIGHT THO
[3:30:25] <%GrumbleGrouse> total Lucas-ing
[3:30:27] <%jiggy_snipe> don't add this retcon is what you do
[3:30:28] <Griffin1171> they should have just made the arbiter shoot first
[3:30:29] <BritishTyrannosaur> Him shooting arbiter is dumb either way. get over it
[3:30:29] <%Ancopro> 'Ma CLunky Arbiter'
[3:30:29] <+Buzzkill983> Would've been better if Tartarus killed him while he was trying to talk
[3:30:31] <Torivore> If they leaned harder into the heritec not believing arbiter couldn't be convinced it would be fine, but NO
[3:30:31] <%krispen_wa> Don't do the last terminal and its fine
[3:30:33] <dinnydanny777> The CGI creature took a dump on screen
[3:30:33] <%jiggy_snipe> cuz it makes the Heretic look dumb
[3:30:34] <nothuzad> cobalt_phoenix_ he kinda literaly says so in that flashback
[3:30:34] <LoganPayne> Massive Lucas Energy
[3:30:36] <%jiggy_snipe> not smart
[3:30:39] <%Pop_O_Matic> @TheShisno They don't make these dumb terminals
[3:30:41] <voodoolawyer> @TheShisno The Arbiter says the Heretic looks like an idiot with a soda can in his mouth, and the Heretic takes back all the good things he says about him.
[3:30:42] <%arkv01> @FuqBoiSlim chat with the ouroboros energy
[3:30:43] <+quinnage7> @brian_peppers1 So you like being shit in your mouth?
[3:30:43] <prime_name> It's a nice micro-story that doesn't fit within the greater story
[3:30:44] <+phatmac16> BUT WE NEED BOSS FIGHT
[3:30:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lewdskeletor13 i mean in that case he just got thrown down a bottomless pit it takes a littl bit of time after th giant penis talks to him to process all of it.
[3:30:46] <Kain5707> @Ancopro eat the mclunky
[3:30:48] <SoaringLettuce> bad writing is bad
[3:30:49] <Goraka91> @TheShisno The problem is the modern terminal being added that makes the scene even dumber
[3:30:50] <penitentpentwitch> Ally
[3:30:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @nothuzad oh woops i am big dumb
[3:30:51] <+ImperiledRed> NOO
[3:30:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 3 HAS TERMINALS?
[3:30:52] <$QueequegTheater> GREEN WOOLIE
[3:30:53] <asd2897> dont shoot
[3:30:53] <TheChucklingOak> They should have just left it alone. I dunno man, I put some blame on Bungie too for making the confrontation for being stupid to begin with
[3:30:55] <$QueequegTheater> WOOLIE NOO
[3:30:56] <Catpurrple> I don't like the changes to the flood lore in this same vein. They explained too much. They didn't need to explain how they came to exist. It's so much worse that they did.
[3:30:57] <%JohnAtDawn> GOOD PERSON WOLLIE
[3:30:58] <+smikeye> teammate woolie
[3:30:59] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> WOOLIE NO
[3:31:00] <bubbli97> yeah that one terminal was unneeded
[3:31:02] <voodoolawyer> @BallerSwagBro9k 3 been had terminals since the jump
[3:31:02] <zocano> 3 was the first to have terminals
[3:31:05] <+Buzzkill983> BETRAYAL
[3:31:10] <+Sp3ctre48> I like how Woolie always has a moment to think about it before he blows his allies head off LUL
[3:31:10] <dinnydanny777> It's almost like this game was rushed.
[3:31:13] <%raven_frame> This is the most sore part of Halo 2 for me.
[3:31:14] <balquisa> Race traitor woolie was taking over
[3:31:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lewdskeletor13 like hell he still refuses to hear the truth when Gravemind teleports him. Over these last 2 levels of his he's probably thinking it over
[3:31:18] <Torivore> Oh shit I double negatived, oh well
[3:31:19] <%krispen_wa> HERE WE GO
[3:31:22] <Bigyanno> leave the gun, take the cannoli
[3:31:22] <%RunningNGunning> Didn't Sabre Interactive do the remake not 343?
[3:31:23] <prince_johnny_> Best partt
[3:31:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @voodoolawyer Maybe i just forgit
[3:31:24] <$QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[3:31:24] <Akett> Brutes do that a lot.
[3:31:25] <subjectg> 3’s terminals are different and require reading, but are great vignettes
[3:31:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LETS GOOOOOOOOOO

[3:32:24] <%Gruhunchously> Johnson the worm master
[3:32:24] <+phatmac16> WHAT A CHAD
[3:32:28] <Ardyn_1zunia> Johnson was about to be executed there so Arbiter inadvertently saved him just there
[3:32:28] <+pedrothecruel> OH I KNOW THAT THE WORMS LIKE
[3:32:28] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Ahhh that moment was slightly ruined by the pre-emptive kill. You see the execution about to take place and Johnson making a run
[3:32:29] <wintrysoma> why does johnson assume arby knows the truth and isn't just fighting the brutes because race war
[3:32:30] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur iirc all the relevant info is in the parts that don’t skip
[3:32:32] <Catpurrple> @Dean_Inbetween That's fine, but I prefer the unknowable than the meticulously catalogued.
[3:32:34] <%xcompleasedad> FLAPPING BANSHEE
[3:32:35] <+TheShisno> Yeah the Scarabs are machines full of Hunter worms
[3:32:35] <MadBaller123> Did he just learn to pilot one by sheer willpower
[3:32:36] <drewslo> Johnson singlehandedly killed everyone piloting the scarab
[3:32:40] <+yhom_tork> SourPls
[3:32:45] <%a_goth_pancake> Time to be sheenoobs

[3:32:53] <+ImperiledRed> @Menitta no
[3:32:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @wintrysoma im guessing since johnson doesn't know about the purge?
[3:32:56] <@Menitta> awww
[3:32:59] <%RunningNGunning> He's invincible, you're not
[3:33:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> WAIT I GOT A SOLUTION: THE SCARAB IS PILOTING ITSELF. HUNTERS ARE STILL PRO-ELITE HERE.
[3:33:02] <+TheDandyGuy> watching ya'll play this is so relaxing fr
[3:33:05] <+ImperiledRed> there are mods for it on pc, at least
[3:33:07] <brachydios777> I’m assuming the UNSC has scarab sims or something
[3:33:09] <Halospaz117> I like to think the Scarab could take damage, but became invincible once Johnson took control
[3:33:09] <+smikeye> and now it's a ground vehicle
[3:33:10] <voodoolawyer> Johnson made it off an exploding Halo ring, bro. He is what is known as "Off-Screen Protagonist"
[3:33:13] <%krispen_wa> SourPls
[3:33:14] <+RowenCleric> reverse escort missions are legit genius I dont know why games dont do them more

[3:33:28] <duskrush> Nice!
[3:33:28] <+phatmac16> JOHNSON IS THE REAL HERO
[3:33:29] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> it is impossible for johnson to pilot the scarab because as we all know humans have never used living things as vehicles
[3:33:30] <%RunningNGunning> yooooo
[3:33:31] <+Brostress> "Ha, how do you like it" sounds like such a RTS unit sound bite
[3:33:31] <The_Swedish_X> Course, he’s invincible so really, you guys are the weakest people in this battlefield

[3:34:10] <LoneO7> dont forgot abou thovering woolie
[3:34:11] <voodoolawyer> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug worms are basically smart computers. Johnson probably grabbed one, neruolinked with it, and they realized how lucky they would be to be piloted by him
[3:34:12] <dinnydanny777> @liquiddinosaur They did in 4 or Reach didn't they?
[3:34:12] <Dean_Inbetween> @catpurrple you dont think at some point it would have been explained in the series at some point? I agree with all the other stuff that the books did leading up to 4 there did not need to be ancient humans or all these forrunner retcons, the didact still could be a thing
[3:34:14] <%Gruhunchously> Woolie is pulling stunts like he was born in the cockpit
[3:34:15] <%cowardman93> woolie it's a plane please
[3:34:16] <idiotscampaign> holding my breath while woolie dodges these shots

[3:34:45] <+yhom_tork> F

[3:34:49] <thebalticguy1> I see em: looks at v
[3:34:50] <dinnydanny777> Pew pew combo
[3:34:50] <huskarl_zap> why the fuc do they now know each other?
[3:34:52] <derap41> You gotta shot a little bit Woolie
[3:34:52] <penitentpentwitch> Still no luck at dogfighting.
[3:34:55] <%a_goth_pancake> ttyl chat, have fun with Tartar Sauce.
[3:34:57] <%DensityD> "i see him" -stares right at Little V Mills-
[3:34:58] <subjectg> he didn’t finish AC7, which is a damn shame
[3:34:59] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @voodoolawyer johnson made sweet love to the worm colony to convince them to let him pilot the scarab
[3:34:59] <Ardyn_1zunia> Music is amazing
[3:35:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> "Squad Leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters, heading your way"
[3:35:02] <@Menitta> he played Ace Combat 7 once
[3:35:02] <%DensityD> monkaS
[3:35:05] <balquisa> They already fought
[3:35:15] <The_Swedish_X> Course, if the banshee dies, you can’t get off the scarab
[3:35:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug but johnson is canonically a 2 pump chump
[3:35:15] <%cowardman93> wooolie forward on left stick PLEASE

[3:35:22] <MadBaller123> love the design of the banshees
[3:35:27] <seniormeatbox> woolie doing flips just to go straight up is pretty cool
[3:35:31] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @liquiddinosaur the worms have low standards
[3:35:33] <%SashaStarshine> SHPEEN
[3:35:39] <+CptBritches> Does Woolie think that the only way to go up is by doing flips?
[3:35:39] <voodoolawyer> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug halo 1 he probably porks the elite as the ring explodes too. halo 3 he's probably gonna pork a Halo Ring
[3:35:45] <derap41> Woolie tries spinning its a good trick
[3:35:51] <brachydios777> SPEEN
[3:35:51] <Bigyanno> maneuvering a banshee is a lot easier with a mouse

[3:36:06] <+RowenCleric> its still good, just ignore the check engine light
[3:36:08] <+TheShisno> Oh man please tell me V and/or Woolie brings the Banshee in
[3:36:14] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @voodoolawyer I'd let johnson pork my halo ring tbh
[3:36:18] <penitentpentwitch> Johnson: "My escort banshees keep dying."

[3:36:27] <%krispen_wa> They can totally do that now
[3:36:28] <%MasterMushin> He's escorting you
[3:36:28] <+smikeye> they don't really lose aim on you
[3:36:30] <DeepSearch27> Woolie is making me dizzy
[3:36:31] <lotharrio> That worm-spider is putting in work.
[3:36:32] <+Buzzkill983> Someone has to be
[3:36:44] <voodoolawyer> OH MY GOD I JUST REALIZED ... Halo has the crosshairs in a slightly higher position than in other shooters. He probably doesn't fly upwards because you have to aim down to correct that change (to look at where is 'normal center')
[3:36:48] <+TheShisno> A POSE
[3:36:50] <+yhom_tork> YEYEYEY
[3:36:51] <Bigyanno> What you can do is get on top of the enemy banshee with your banshee, jump out and hijack his banshee in midair

[3:38:17] <%Pop_O_Matic> There's no fall damage, so if your Banshee's about to blow you can just bail.

[3:39:19] <ChernoMuncho> woolie droping like a rock
[3:39:20] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur in later games, but it’s not noticeable against ai
[3:39:20] <%jiggy_snipe> let Woolie have fun with his manuevers
[3:39:23] <%dekkitout> Speen
[3:39:29] <voodoolawyer> Trickster! Gunslinger! Trickster! Gunslinger!
[3:39:33] <%Gruhunchously> Isn't it nice in games when vehicles are fully developed mechanics and not just a single-level gimmick.
[3:39:36] <%shoutofthehobo> feet!
[3:39:55] <BritishTyrannosaur> feet pics
[3:39:55] <+smikeye> uh, but these are a single level gimmick?
[3:40:06] <voodoolawyer> a single level gimmick TWICE
[3:40:08] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @Gruhunchously yeeeeeep
[3:40:09] <voodoolawyer> it's different
[3:40:12] <MoshPitMoira> @Gruhunchously Hey now, don't make fun of Destiny like that lol
[3:40:16] <+smikeye> as in, they're used for a level as a pace change, and that's all
[3:40:16] <Ardyn_1zunia> Funniest part is the Scarab doesn't need to be escorted. It's a scarab
[3:40:17] <%Solidnick18> going at the speed of slow
[3:40:23] <BritishTyrannosaur> it's different because not 343. 343 bad
[3:40:26] <+yhom_tork> LuL
[3:40:26] <buster7800> @smikeye at least a 2 level gimmick
[3:40:33] <Nevflinn> BOOM

[3:41:22] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @gruhunchously no, thats a pedophile
[3:41:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously no that's a pedophile
[3:41:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> jinx
[3:41:28] <voodoolawyer> See? Because the crosshairs are about 65% up screen instead of 50% up the screen, he has to look downwards to go where he thinks is forwards.
[3:41:29] <ChernoMuncho> no banshee glitch?
[3:41:30] <subjectg> I’m a Jiralhanae of peace! I’m done killin!

[3:45:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:45:45] <Nevflinn> Tartarus is more envious than stupid. He understands, he just doesn't WANT to believe
[3:45:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer500 The Heretic “retcon” really doesn’t bother me for a lot of reasons. Even before the remaster, I assumed he was one of the Elites that served under Arbiter during the first games events because how else would he have met Guilty Spark? Even after being betrayed by the Prophets, Arby still says he believes in the sacred rings, so it’s pretty clear he wouldn’t have believed The Heretic, and he knew that Arby would carry out his duty, he says so in the terminal. Just my opinion though
[3:45:47] <%dekkitout> "Start blastn"
[3:45:49] <TungstenViper> NOT YOU ELITES
[3:45:53] <Torivore> Did Woolie just say a racist
[3:45:56] <zocano> the greater good
[3:45:57] <Bigyanno> Because it pretty much worked
[3:45:57] <%krispen_wa> PARAGRAPH EWW
[3:45:57] <+YabbaTroll> gonna die anyway
[3:45:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> starve them
[3:45:59] <huskarl_zap> Unless you want spoilers
[3:46:00] <SmallpoxJenkins> If you kill all the hosts, they can't infect you
[3:46:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GRATER GOOD
[3:46:01] <Djinnazz> no foo,d no flood.
[3:46:02] <%Lunatyr_> Greater good
[3:46:03] <huskarl_zap> dont ask
[3:46:04] <correctedsun117> Flood is worse than death
[3:46:04] <Pnutz409> crazy talk
[3:46:04] <dinnydanny777> Well Woolie, if you become a flood they're mo longer a problem
[3:46:04] <Goraka91> It kills the flood and eliminates their food source
[3:46:05] <duskrush> It eliminates the galaxy, but not the universe
[3:46:05] <%dekkitout> Can't be killed if you kill yourself HahaThink
[3:46:05] <alastorpayne> you took the food
[3:46:06] <LoganPayne> What does "Reclaimer" mean, Woolie?
[3:46:07] <+MessyBristles> you're starving them
[3:46:08] <%arkv01> scorched earth,
[3:46:08] <+Sp3ctre48> Killing life stops the Flood from infecting things
[3:46:09] <derap41> All sapient life
[3:46:11] <Divryne> Woolie wait until Halo 3.
[3:46:11] <TungstenViper> because they're a cancer
[3:46:11] <+TheShisno> Save paragraphs for the subreddit
[3:46:12] <turbofolk> SHUT UP THO
[3:46:12] <buster7800> WAIT FOR HALO 3
[3:46:12] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus sacrifice one galaxy to save the universe
[3:46:13] <Ardyn_1zunia> I can't believe Woolie is this dumb
[3:46:13] <drewslo> literally the last resort
[3:46:14] <+wah_ha_ha> That Eltie is going Ham
[3:46:14] <Djinnazz> starve them out.
[3:46:14] <+JustToWatch> all SENTIENT life
[3:46:15] <privatecorgi> Flood can just go into hibernation cant they
[3:46:15] <%ChoculaUltra> so that means the cats were okay right?
[3:46:17] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Life would regrow eventually
[3:46:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Maybe that answer is in Halo 3 Kappa
[3:46:17] <+CammerTime21> "Last Resort"
[3:46:17] <alastorpayne> kill all life = no food for the flood
[3:46:18] <huskarl_zap> Its spoilers but background material
[3:46:19] <+Juriasu> wipe every intelligent species that can build space ships to stop them from spreading
[3:46:19] <dinnydanny777> The real solution is to become the Hivemind
[3:46:19] <Mister_Teatime> it eliminates everything in the galaxy not the universe
[3:46:20] <+GreenCMD> HALO rings also have repopulation tech onboard as well
[3:46:21] <IntrepidEye> Because the flood were consuming everything. nothing else could stop the,
[3:46:21] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> basically wipe everything out and let bacteria evolve again
[3:46:22] <+wunp_fxs> literally no other choice
[3:46:22] <%Gruhunchously> Like worms?
[3:46:24] <thelivingglitch307> They had no way to protect themselves
[3:46:24] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s super last resort
[3:46:25] <Sullry> halo 3 woolie
[3:46:26] <%Chatterbox1991> The Reapers
[3:46:27] <sniffy77> the flood are far more lovecraftian than you might think.
[3:46:28] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Almost like Woolie would like a future Halo game for it's lore
[3:46:28] <Zebroneath> Can't wipe away ectoplasm
[3:46:28] <%cowardman93> it's not about saving the current species, it's about making sure life can carry on
[3:46:28] <brachydios777> All SENTIANT life
[3:46:30] <duskrush> It was their last option
[3:46:30] <$QueequegTheater> BIG HAMMER

[3:46:32] <Bigyanno> There is a reason but it might be spoilers

[3:46:35] <turbofolk> Well until 343 took over
[3:46:36] <stayinthepocket> Why is a reset button so hard to understand?
[3:46:37] <FreedomARX7> microbes still live
[3:46:38] <RamenRiderZ> BANANA SLAMMA
[3:46:41] <%Josef_Stryker> So what you're saying is Pat would survive. Haha I'm funny psaBougie
[3:46:44] <ISkyHunterI> The tyranids did nothing wrong SwiftRage
[3:46:44] <TungstenViper> They had already lost, there was no other choice left
[3:46:45] <Ray326> The halos target thought
[3:46:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 how does the death blast discriminate on how intelligent something is to kill it
[3:46:52] <Saffry_Ruzin> "After exhausting every strategic Other option"
[3:46:53] <%Nomad94> for ONE second
[3:46:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> I explained that already my dude. Passing the torch to the next thing to evolve.
[3:46:56] <+CptBritches> Woolie...
[3:46:59] <bubbajoe117> Actually they preserved life through cloning DNA samples they'd indexed but I guess V isn't wanting to tell Woolie that yet
[3:47:00] <voodoolawyer> Pat would be destroyed immediately, as he would be indistinguishable from the Flood
[3:47:01] <turbofolk> All the forerunners were gone until 343 said NO WE NEED MORE GAMES
[3:47:02] <Nevflinn> This is the last real boss fight in the trilogy
[3:47:04] <BritishTyrannosaur> never knew it was johnson breaking the shield
[3:47:04] <$usotaku013666> Time for a real boss fight!
[3:47:09] <+TheShisno> It's just an up
[3:47:12] <phantalime> this fight stinky
[3:47:13] <Saffry_Ruzin> The Flood is literally THAT bad
[3:47:15] <OldOnyx> That question is answered perfectly by HUGE SPOILERS that anywhere soon in the series
[3:47:16] <+Sp3ctre48> Woolie missing the whole fight Keepo
[3:47:19] <+the_krypto_knight> At this point the idea is supposed to be “they chose a galaxy where life would recover eventually over one completely consumed by the flood”
[3:47:19] <%Solidnick18> Hammer time
[3:47:20] <+Joelexion> ptpChug ptpChug ptpChug
[3:47:21] <Goraka91> @turbofolk Then they said nah they're gone evil robots though
[3:47:21] <@Menitta> to be fair I dont think it was 343 who said that
[3:47:22] <%arkv01> isn't the flood just the zerg?
[3:47:26] <Bigyanno> How many times do you think woolie will accidently back up into the lift?
[3:47:27] <Dean_Inbetween> @menitta nobody knew the truth until they found the rings and the oracles

[3:48:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> @smikeye its hard to make non-bad FPS bosses
[3:48:06] <$QueequegTheater> @arkv01 Not really, the Zerg assimilate powerful archetypes into their own DNA while the Flood resets anything into combat forms

[3:48:12] <dinnydanny777> 343 Bad? But they made Cortana so thicc :/

[3:48:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur Kind of spoilers: Something called Neural Physics, which is basically metaphysical space magic. It can do a lot of weird stuff, including kill shit with too complex of a nervous system.
[3:48:22] <%arkv01> @LiquidDinosaur yeah I did remember reading about the flood's original roots, but I'm still not convinced it's much more different than the zerg's MO
[3:48:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HE HAS NO GRACE
[3:48:25] <Goraka91> @BritishTyrannosaur Though they did retcon him into being two people
[3:48:26] <%hattrick61> HE HAS NO GRACE
[3:48:29] <+smikeye> I never bother shooting him until his shield is down anyway
[3:48:31] <alrobot2014> johnson and an elite with double needlers stun locked and killed him for me
[3:48:34] <BritishTyrannosaur> tbh it's a fun simple boss
[3:48:35] <Bigyanno> I would argue 343 made Cortana TOO thicc
[3:48:39] <Saffry_Ruzin> Guilty Spark literally said "After they exhausted every other strategic option"
[3:48:41] <voodoolawyer> This Kong ... believes Brutes are the superior race
[3:48:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 best Cortana is Halo CE cortana

[3:53:51] <MadBaller123> 0 days since Chief went to finish fight
[3:53:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> well, the Brutes didn't want to talk
[3:53:53] <+smikeye> yeah I remember people being real mad about this ending
[3:53:55] <DatAsuna> no it was still botched without the terminal
[3:54:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> people HATED halo 2s ending
[3:54:00] <%MacabreOpus> I mean Tartarus ultimately failed the Just Talk
[3:54:00] <penitentpentwitch> Level up Charisma more next time!
[3:54:01] <%BisoromiBear> botched retcons
[3:54:06] <voodoolawyer> this game is way better when you play this without sound in a Best Buy
[3:54:08] <lotharrio> "Just talk!"
[3:54:08] <huskarl_zap> weapon balance is outta wack in 2
[3:54:11] <+CyanDeadEye> Bungie made it, so it *was* Bungie's fault
[3:54:11] <DatAsuna> you're blaming 343 for expanding on an old botch
[3:54:11] <%doomerskeletor13> It was still bad without the terminal
[3:54:12] <%LavenderLaser> LavenderLaser converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[3:54:12] <+phatmac16> WHERE IS BREAKING BENJAMIN
[3:54:13] <%arkv01> FINISH INSIDE, John
[3:54:15] <%Double_Tap_That> Is she though?
[3:54:17] <+TheShisno> It was always botched, Bungie wrote that fight in 2004
[3:54:18] <%krispen_wa> ....can he grab her tho?
[3:54:18] <Goraka91> Maybe he can you don't know
[3:54:18] <ralphfromdk> It's sad to think how good of a story Bungie can do when they want to. And then we got Destiny...
[3:54:24] <%DensityD> Naw tho, gravemind can DO -THINGS-
[3:54:24] <MadBaller123> I think Halo 2 got cut kind of like Sonic & knuckles
[3:54:28] <huskarl_zap> cortana isn't real oh boy woolie are you in for a suprise
[3:54:32] <dinnydanny777> Can I grab her tho
[3:54:35] <DinoBear_7> It was still kinda dumb but the terminal “””””retcon”””” showed how stupid it was
[3:54:36] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie is still in a dream, halo eater
[3:54:38] <Martiger434> The fight didn't make sense in the original either
[3:54:39] <dinnydanny777> :)
[3:54:39] <%NovaKnightmare> ALL
[3:54:40] <%RioGascar> Talk extremely bad for gravemind
[3:54:41] <+DrFacilier> Woolie you should take a look at what early '00s game journalists had to say about the Gravemind
[3:54:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> time for #mindbreak
[3:54:42] <+YabbaTroll> galaxy
[3:54:42] <subjectg> Bungie botched it first technically, but 343’s still gotta shoulder the blame for calling more attention to it
[3:54:44] <%krispen_wa> CORTANA ISN'T REAL, SHE CAN'T HURT YOU

[3:55:16] <IndoorSitup> 25,000 light years.
[3:55:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> A metric fuck ton
[3:55:17] <+Buzzkill983> Grunts would survive? they csnt sustain flood
[3:55:17] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Well if it takes all 7 for the entire galaxy. Then divide by 7
[3:55:17] <Saffry_Ruzin> It's because the Flood is thaaaat bad
[3:55:17] <%Tearonex> 25,000 lightyears
[3:55:18] <+Yawhn> There are more answers to this in sequels...
[3:55:18] <%Irridium> or 25,000
[3:55:18] <%cowardman93> NO
[3:55:18] <%arkv01> you're basically taking away all the perishable foods out in the open in your house so flies stop breeding indoors
[3:55:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> 1/7th
[3:55:19] <irregularly_irregular> Anything but micro-organisms, Woolie, therefore giving life another chance.
[3:55:20] <%Ancopro> 1 will not
[3:55:20] <+barrakuta371> 1 halo is 1/7 the galaxy
[3:55:21] <lotharrio> Oh, or maybe more like 1/5 of the galaxy.
[3:55:21] <Halospaz117> It will fuck a chunk of the galaxy
[3:55:22] <Catpurrple> Entire galaxy is 100,000 light years across, about
[3:55:22] <%DomunDomunDomun> One firing sets off the others.
[3:55:23] <HorribleHog> Probably about a seventh
[3:55:25] <+That_Marcus_Dude> 1/7th
[3:55:27] <+Bonerlord911> no but if you turn one on they all turn on
[3:55:27] <%shadowsofpain> 25k lightyears radius of the ring
[3:55:28] <%ringabal> Remember the end of Mass Effect 3? That my a factor of 5
[3:55:28] <Ardyn_1zunia> It would be enough to kill humans and the Covenant
[3:55:29] <%r0chelimit> 25000 light years
[3:55:30] <%Proxzo> All Sentient Life 1/7th the galaxy
[3:55:30] <Nevflinn> If all 7 rings fire and cover the whole galaxy, 1 ring is then 1/7th
[3:55:30] <duskrush> it'll starve to death
[3:55:32] <sendart> one firing triggers the others
[3:55:33] <idiotscampaign> the rest fire afterwards
[3:55:33] <Kato__v> No
[3:55:33] <dinnydanny777> Wow that ending sure was abrupt, almost like this game was rushed or something

[3:55:36] <+D00msDayDan> when one ring fires it sets off all of the others too
[3:55:36] <%doomerskeletor13> All 7 is the whole galaxy

[3:55:36] <+barrakuta371> 1 firing set off the others.

[3:55:38] <Halospaz117> It can't eat
[3:55:38] <%lioan515> Chain reaction
[3:55:38] <+Freeborg1997> Tartarus, the Prophets have betrayed us.
[3:55:38] <+FennecZephyr> The problem is that when one is set off, the rest goes off to

[3:55:39] <drewslo> it's everything humans have been too
[3:55:39] <+leviting> to starve it to death
[3:55:39] <+Extrallent> Can't take anything if it's all dead
[3:55:40] <huskarl_zap> Grunts would inherit the galaxy if the halos fired
[3:55:41] <Shardlab> The Flood starves
[3:55:42] <$serpenttucker> It does not take everything over

[3:55:44] <%paladinstarbuster> Woolie your an idiot
[3:55:44] <%Slimshazbot> Woolie it's a sacrifice for the greater good
[3:55:44] <dinnydanny777> We have to stop the Borg by starving them of food, Woolie
[3:55:45] <Joestar1890> No biomass = Flood starve
[3:55:45] <%exnuart> BORG OR DIE
[3:55:45] <+Kqha4000> halo 1 terminals answer this
[3:55:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> The Halos are weapons of YOU DIDNT WIN
[3:55:46] <+Yawhn> Gotta play Halo 4
[3:55:46] <Djinnazz> then it can't make anymore.
[3:55:47] <subjectg> No food, no life
[3:55:47] <Nevflinn> "The only way to beat the Flood is to starve them to death"
[3:55:47] <Captain_sevatar> They mentioned an Ark
[3:55:47] <%Nomad94> Woolie, they tried everything else, and it didn't work
[3:55:48] <%doomerskeletor13> They tried literally everything else first
[3:55:48] <idiotscampaign> it was real bad dude
[3:55:48] <stayinthepocket> My lord it isn't complicated
[3:55:49] <Goraka91> The rings also kill the Flood itself
[3:55:49] <%DensityD> flood is worse than roaches
[3:55:49] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus if it eats the entire galaxy it can then LEAVE the galaxy and eat ANOTHER galaxy
[3:55:49] <seniormeatbox> All strategic options were exhausted
[3:55:50] <nothuzad> its not "oh no they are coming" its "oh no we are fucked"
[3:55:51] <haitakaa> sentient
[3:55:51] <privatecorgi> Gravemind didnt starve though
[3:55:52] <Bigyanno> the flood needs higher life to feed. Kill higher life and the flood starves to death
[3:55:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> they did of starvation
[3:55:52] <RamenRiderZ> Spiders got out, burn the house
[3:55:52] <+Bonerlord911> IT LITERALLY HAD THE ENTIRE GALAXY
[3:55:52] <voodoolawyer> Floor Jurassic Park
[3:55:52] <buster7800> HALO 3 WOOLIE
[3:55:53] <+Fenrein> Gravemind starves, life begins anew
[3:55:53] <dinnydanny777> Woolie the flood will kill everything
[3:55:54] <$serpenttucker> and the point isn't to sustain your species
[3:55:54] <+barrakuta371> The science behind it is kinda spoilers
[3:55:55] <%The_Timo> Burn the fields, we do that lol
[3:55:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> the purpose of Halo is "YOU DIDN'T WIN"
[3:55:56] <+GreenCMD> Halos are a reset button, there are stored genetic data to restart life
[3:55:57] <%RioGascar> The flood needs hosts to survive
[3:55:59] <+TheShisno> One actual
[3:55:59] <+Juriasu> nuke everything so that the galaxy can then be reclaimed
[3:55:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This question is answered in 3, Woolie
[3:56:01] <+casualbaloth> They forerunners couldn't beat the flood so as a last resort they decided to starve it out
[3:56:01] <DeepSearch27> Bruh. Life gets DUSTED
[3:56:01] <asd2897> last resort, they were fucked and had already lost
[3:56:02] <brachydios777> They tried everything at first
[3:56:04] <haitakaa> they all fire together I thought
[3:56:04] <%eggypigeon> YOU DIDNT WIN - The Forerunners
[3:56:10] <voodoolawyer> @LiquidDinosaur that's the greatest
[3:56:11] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Bacteria is alive
[3:56:11] <%Gruhunchously> <<This twisted game needs to be reset>>
[3:56:13] <stayinthepocket> You think life can't ever come back?
[3:56:13] <+wah_ha_ha> Only SENTIENT LIFE WOOLIE, Everything else can evolve again
[3:56:14] <dinnydanny777> It wipes out a region of space
[3:56:16] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Woolie has questions for future Halo games
[3:56:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @eggypigeon ironically that's the Flood's motive too
[3:56:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> LIFE EVOLVES AGAIN
[3:56:17] <prime_name> Is it time for Halo Legends?
[3:56:18] <vulkan_vibes> think nuerons
[3:56:19] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The Flood survives on a certain mass Woolie. This was explained before dude.
[3:56:19] <+Joelexion> Brother they have a repopulation plan after killing everything
[3:56:19] <lexcorphr> They literally tried everything else first
[3:56:19] <huskarl_zap> you have to spoil offensive bias to explain
[3:56:20] <Nevflinn> The idea isn't that YOU win by firing Halo, it's that THE NEXT GENERATION wins
[3:56:21] <Nobuwaroo> Evolution woolie
[3:56:21] <%GrumbleGrouse> how did gravemind survive tho
[3:56:23] <+smikeye> rodents, insects live
[3:56:23] <irregularly_irregular> LIFE FINDS A WAY
[3:56:23] <JetpackMcQuack> Scroched earth
[3:56:26] <+Extrallent> Yeah but the Halos are so spread out that the odds of the Flood finding something to consume again are much smaller
[3:56:26] <RedSqurrl> REAPEEEEERS
[3:56:27] <dinnydanny777> It wipes out a region of space where the flood reside
[3:56:27] <+yhom_tork> THE REAPERS
[3:56:27] <%Tuna_Can_0> Life uhhhh finds a way
[3:56:27] <lotharrio> Life uh, uh, uh, finds a way.
[3:56:28] <vulkan_vibes> complex neural life forms.
[3:56:29] <correctedsun117> @WoolieVersus Also, they just called something THE ARK
[3:56:29] <subjectg> The primordial soup of life still lives
[3:56:29] <+TheShisno> Halo Legends after Halo 3
[3:56:30] <+smikeye> it's dependent on brain mass
[3:56:31] <brachydios777> The Rings were a very last resort
[3:56:31] <+wunp_fxs> forerunner predate everyone by a looooong time
[3:56:31] <+Blarghnox> they're reapers
[3:56:31] <balquisa> they saved humans and covenant races in stasis
[3:56:31] <duskrush> life finds a way
[3:56:31] <90k9> JOJO part 6
[3:56:32] <@Menitta> the forerunners are basically the protheans right
[3:56:33] <+YabbaTroll> like nah though
[3:56:34] <Jaku2011> Halo is "YOU DIDN'T WIN"
[3:56:34] <+Kqha4000> You need to spoil alot of stuff to answer woolies question
[3:56:35] <+OranHexthief> its the reapers but a nuke instead woolie
[3:56:35] <+yhom_tork> OH MY GOD ITS THE REAPERS LMAO
[3:56:36] <HorribleHog> What I don't get is that the Flood seems smart enough not to eat all of its food
[3:56:36] <ralphfromdk> It was fired like a loooooong time ago.
[3:56:37] <dinnydanny777> The point is to NEVER LET THE FLOOD LEAVE THAT PART OF SPACE
[3:56:39] <%DensityD> soooooooooooooooooooo advanced
[3:56:39] <Torivore> Woolie, Gravemind took over High Charity in like an hour. They are a problem!
[3:56:40] <+CammerTime21> Its explained in halo 4 i think? they kept backups of the major species through seeding planets after the firing
[3:56:40] <%Feralspirit41> Sentient life is killed but things can re-evolve into sentient and intelligent beings
[3:56:41] <LoganPayne> Woolie, they keep using that word "Reclaimer"
[3:56:41] <subjectg> Woolie this is literally Biology 101
[3:56:42] <haitakaa> @woolieversus flood only infect sentient life
[3:56:44] <%Pop_O_Matic> They explain it in the terminals in 3 IIRC
[3:56:45] <Nevflinn> @Menitta Except the Forerunners actually made their stuff
[3:56:47] <Goraka91> It was a little bad
[3:56:49] <%arkv01> naaah the forerunners are just bitches
[3:56:49] <+Yawhn> Flood spread way way crazy, thus why this is necessary
[3:56:49] <%NovaKnightmare> There's also a Animatrix esque short that explains this
[3:56:49] <undercoverbarber> Grunts cant be fed on
[3:56:54] <@Menitta> Oh yeah true
[3:56:56] <dinnydanny777> Woolie they can FLY SPACE SHIPS NOW
[3:56:56] <%Nomad94> they tried EVERYTHING else firsz
[3:56:58] <$ZeOrbling> its painful to listen but cant spoil
[3:56:58] <+Yawhn> Doomed if you do, even more doomed if you don't
[3:56:58] <JetpackMcQuack> It's so bad, we might as well start over
[3:56:59] <alastorpayne> it was explained in the shitty movie halo legends
[3:57:00] <Sullry> it was that bad woolie
[3:57:00] <bubbli97> where did the Flood come from anyway? bioweapon of the Forerunners gone wrong?
[3:57:01] <Ahk_90> @WoolieVersus just described Gears of War backstory LUL
[3:57:01] <%Irridium> yes
[3:57:03] <%DensityD> OH LOOK AT MY LARGE FORERUNNER BRAIN, I'm so advanced Kreygasm
[3:57:04] <+BrainOneOhOne> flood is fed
[3:57:04] <unclekulikov> But the flood didn't starve...?
[3:57:04] <prime_name> Basically
[3:57:05] <%krispen_wa> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[3:57:05] <Ashenik1> But the flood survived though
[3:57:06] <$serpenttucker> A better alternative to just having a flood galaxy
[3:57:06] <%arkv01> they never even consulted with everyone about the scorched earth genocide tactic, fuckin assholes
[3:57:09] <%dekkitout> "Life will find a way"
[3:57:09] <Goraka91> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[3:57:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Floor were that bad
[3:57:11] <+Bonerlord911> woolie what part of "last resort" did you not get
[3:57:11] <dinnydanny777> They are CAPABLE OF INTER GALACTIC TRAVEL
[3:57:11] <%paladinstarbuster> yes why are you confused
[3:57:11] <+the_krypto_knight> There is also an installation literally called the Ark they mention at the end
[3:57:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Guilty Spark said they exhausted every other option
[3:57:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> Flood winning = BIG HUGE bad
[3:57:13] <%threeheadedwalrus> Didn't they have species stored to repopulate?
[3:57:14] <Sullry> precursers
[3:57:15] <%lioan515> End of History is bad
[3:57:16] <MoshPitMoira> Germs proceed to re-evolve into a flood like parasitic life form lmao gottem
[3:57:17] <+GreenCMD> woolie just wikidive it after 3
[3:57:18] <%Irridium> the YOU DIDN'T WIN weapons
[3:57:18] <Camail> the flood consuming the galaxy is bad for everyone
[3:57:19] <duskrush> there's an animatrix style thing that shows the history
[3:57:22] <SoaringLettuce> basically, if you delete multicellular life in Pegasus, the wraith from Stargate atlantis starve to death
[3:57:22] <voodoolawyer> Zombie bites your arm -- lop of the arm or die?
[3:57:22] <lotharrio> What's better, rolling the die on a new species, or letting everything become part of the zombie plague forever?
[3:57:22] <Ahk_90> Oh shit Locusts! NUKE EVERYTHING
[3:57:24] <%jiggy_snipe> a big reset is somewhat common in galatic stories
[3:57:26] <janne833> the reseeded life
[3:57:26] <+smikeye> yeah, wonder why there's a place called THE ARK?
[3:57:27] <ashenjuan25> We doing 3??
[3:57:27] <+TheShisno> A thousand plans tried and failed, and they obviously had to settle on nuking the galaxy for some reason
[3:57:29] <+moondog_> halo 4 answers these questions
[3:57:29] <Floofiie> Is woolie gonna be playing 4 and 5?
[3:57:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:57:31] <%raven_frame> Cheer500 I think Johnson is the real hero of Halo 2, considering that he helped stop the Delta Halo from firing, and spearheaded Human and Sangheili cooperation with the Arbiter. As well if you recall what was going on with Keyes in CE, it looked like he was being turned into a proto Gravemind. Which as the name implies is made when the Flood amasses enough biomass and memory. Also I believe Master Chief was 41 in this, and Thel Vadam was 67. Some old video game boys.
[3:57:31] <Bigyanno> There is more to what the forerunners did, but those might be spoilers, I'm not sure
[3:57:33] <haitakaa> big evolution
[3:57:33] <%DensityD> HALO installations have multifunctions
[3:57:34] <IntrepidEye> The Forerunner stored species then reseeded the galaxy after the rings fired
[3:57:34] <angriestman> they reseeded the life that was killed at some point
[3:57:35] <+BrainOneOhOne> fire the Halo, flood is fed
[3:57:35] <%Navekraith> Navekraith subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[3:57:39] <brachydios777> @threeheadedwalrus Shhh they don’t know that yet
[3:57:42] <%Nomad94> not this stupid thing
[3:57:42] <Saffry_Ruzin> Yeah, A Thousand plans tried and failed
[3:57:43] <jboi7> Watch halo legends woolie
[3:57:44] <Goraka91> Why would you keep the Flood alive you dumb fucks
[3:57:45] <Ray326> The flood would make literal MOUNTAINS that they used as biological cannons to spread from planet to planet...
[3:57:45] <asd2897> the halo onyx book touches on some other counter measures they had
[3:57:47] <%GrumbleGrouse> I like these questions unanswered
[3:57:47] <%Nomad94> Scam train, uuuugggh
[3:57:47] <%CptnCampy61> The anime answers this
[3:57:49] <stayinthepocket> Wiping it all out and resetting is objectively better than a space parasite rule and control everything
[3:57:52] <@Menitta> Nah why would Woolie do Halo 3? This was clearly the definitive ending Kappa
[3:57:53] <MoshPitMoira> flood go down, cycle of evolution go big up
[3:57:54] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus if the flood ate all biomass in the galaxy, they'd start looking for food in other galaxies
[3:57:56] <%arkv01> "keep some flood alive, so john can finish the fight"
[3:57:58] <Kato__v> Just wait until Woolie finds out about shield worlds
[3:57:58] <ZippierJosh> halo leyends gives context
[3:58:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> @raven_frame dont elites live to be a few hundred years
[3:58:04] <%DensityD> I say a little prayer to Sergeant Johnson every night before bed.
[3:58:04] <bubbli97> Where did the Flood come from? Is it something the Forerunners made? @WoolieVersus
[3:58:08] <$QueequegTheater> FLOOD OR MIS
[3:58:08] <voodoolawyer> @WoolieVersus you gotta play multiplayer to get the whole story
[3:58:10] <%Ancopro> flood is fed
[3:58:11] <%krispen_wa> Mid or Flood feed
[3:58:11] <%NovaKnightmare> Go top or feed
[3:58:13] <+ImperiledRed> @bubbli97 spoilers
[3:58:15] <DigitalJoshie> flood fed as FUCK
[3:58:16] <$QueequegTheater> TOP OR FLOOD
[3:58:16] <bubbajoe117> @bubbli97 Look up Hiddenexperia's "The Precursors" videos, but in essence the Flood are a devolved and mutated form of an extragalatic species.
[3:58:17] <asd2897> flood came from outside the galaxy
[3:58:17] <%RioGascar> @menitta Fight finished. Clearly
[3:58:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> Flood is FED
[3:58:18] <+CptBritches> They are killing themselves in the hope that life can prosper
[3:58:18] <derap41> Its fucking mass effect all over again
[3:58:18] <BlackermanZX> flood or feed
[3:58:20] <%dekkitout> Halo is top NotLikeThis
[3:58:20] <Goraka91> @bubbli97 In a sense
[3:58:22] <huskarl_zap> grunts cant support flood
[3:58:23] <+smikeye> they'll need to do Halo 4 Spartan Ops too
[3:58:23] <voodoolawyer> Mid or Halo
[3:58:24] <%DensityD> Where did you go? where did you come from gravemind joe?
[3:58:25] <+Kqha4000> Halo 1 terminals
[3:58:28] <derap41> All Sapient life
[3:58:28] <Louie_Salmon> Flood is FED, /CONCEDE
[3:58:30] <$QueequegTheater> @derap41 Before Mass Effect
[3:58:30] <dinnydanny777> No Woolie, the rings only wipe out a portion of the universe
[3:58:31] <%RioGascar> Start over
[3:58:31] <voodoolawyer> Flood is fed
[3:58:31] <+cha0tic_klutch> Or rodents
[3:58:32] <haitakaa> I'm surprised woolie isn't asking about the origin of the flood
[3:58:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Mice are ok
[3:58:34] <+TheShisno> Anything that can host the Flood dies
[3:58:34] <Bigyanno> You cannot win against the flood. You can only both lose
[3:58:35] <%exnuart> ANYTHING BIGGER THAN A DOG
[3:58:36] <VidulaSaix> The idea is that life has a CHANCE to revive itself as opposed to the Flood just eating it all and it ending outright
[3:58:38] <dinnydanny777> Woolie the ring doesn't wipe out all of space
[3:58:39] <phantalime> sentient
[3:58:41] <derap41> @QueequegTheater I mean the fermi gate
[3:58:43] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus
[3:58:43] <Ray326> Halo or feed flood is fed
[3:58:45] <brachydios777> Halo legends explains a good chunk of that back story
[3:58:47] <%jiggy_snipe> greater good?
[3:58:48] <%Slimshazbot> Woolie...
[3:58:49] <Goraka91> Suicide weapon
[3:58:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GENIUS
[3:58:50] <zocano> It's for the greater good
[3:58:50] <dinnydanny777> It only wipes out the area they are in before they escape
[3:58:50] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @louie_salmon flood got fed, surrender at 20, ggs
[3:58:51] <+CammerTime21> Woolie they LOST
[3:58:52] <duskrush> It's more "Let's take the flood with us"
[3:58:52] <+slimmixrp> Would you rather live as infected zombie or just die @WoolieVersus
[3:58:52] <bleugh> because flood bad it has to be stopped
[3:58:53] <%Nomad94> Woolie ...
[3:58:53] <%cowardman93> so life can carry on Woolie
[3:58:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> WOOLIE HOW DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND "YOU DIDN'T WIN"
[3:58:53] <%krispen_wa> SPARE THE REST OF THE LIFE WOOLIE
[3:58:54] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> yeah its selfless
[3:58:54] <Djinnazz> no, they were gonna BE flood.
[3:58:54] <Camail> its self sacrifice
[3:58:55] <$serpenttucker> Because an entire flood galaxy is a BAD THING
[3:58:55] <black_pariah> ITS A YOU DIDNT WIN
[3:58:56] <+Extrallent> It wasn't to save themselves. it was to save everything else
[3:58:56] <derap41> 300 year war
[3:58:56] <seniormeatbox> Woolie do you want to become a tentacle monster
[3:58:58] <Goraka91> Taking you with me
[3:58:58] <Ardyn_1zunia> Woolie THEY LOST
[3:58:59] <+greatgetter> They tried everything else
[3:58:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie, remember what did Spark mention at the very end? where you can activate all the rings?
[3:58:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> LAST RESORT
[3:58:59] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Future things to be revealed!
[3:59:00] <alrobot2014> guilty spark said they tried EVERYTHING
[3:59:00] <subjectg> Woolie they tried everything else
[3:59:01] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus there are other galaxies that exist and also have life on them
[3:59:01] <%DomunDomunDomun> There is no "if". They were hard fucked.
[3:59:01] <+RowenCleric> kill ourselves to secure the future basically
[3:59:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LAST RESORT
[3:59:02] <lotharrio> "We're gonna die either way. Let's make sure they don't win."
[3:59:03] <+barrakuta371> Chat, I understand Woolie is confused, but be careful with spoilers
[3:59:03] <+maenos2> 343 said it was a last resoet
[3:59:04] <derap41> 300 years
[3:59:05] <+RowenCleric> very selfless
[3:59:05] <Paynexkiller> Woolie, the forerunners fucking survive dude.
[3:59:06] <%Irridium> so you just gonna let the flood win?
[3:59:06] <stayinthepocket> So you'd just allow space zombie to take over?
[3:59:06] <+Ozmodyas> The idea is that the Flood are a living hell that would never allow any kind of life other than itself to exist again if it wins
[3:59:06] <%Proxzo> If they could target specific biology, can't they target the flood with the halo.
[3:59:06] <asd2897> they had already lost
[3:59:07] <slamview> BIGGEST LASTEST RESORT
[3:59:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Bonerlord911
[3:59:09] <+Blarghnox> they tried like a million things
[3:59:10] <Saffry_Ruzin> Should totally watch Halo Legends after Halo 3
[3:59:10] <+MessyBristles> @WoolieVersus Its to give future civilizations a chance
[3:59:10] <%Nomad94> Woolie doesn't know what a last resort is
[3:59:11] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> this was their LAST RESORT
[3:59:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus RECALL THAT GUILTY SPARK SAID "THE ARK"
[3:59:11] <+cha0tic_klutch> It would fuck up the entire galaxy if the flood was aloud to spread and poison it
[3:59:11] <black_pariah> LETS SAVE THE NEXT GENERATION
[3:59:12] <+CammerTime21> Woolie they BIG LOST
[3:59:12] <thebestestkevin> remember @WoolieVersus, the flood have demonstrated advanced intelligence
[3:59:12] <+jeasybakeoven> they were dead anyway so if they died to stop the flood it was worth it
[3:59:13] <Budabist> the forerunners thought bigger than just their species, they thought about the rest of the galaxy @WoolieVersus
[3:59:13] <%doomerskeletor13> It was a last resort act of selflessness
[3:59:13] <%Gruhunchously> Better to die than to be assimilated
[3:59:14] <%DensityD> "LETS Sacrifice ourselves so other life can have a peaceful existance"
[3:59:14] <+GreenCMD> Woolie the flood hive mind absorb your mind, hive forms aren't dead
[3:59:15] <+CptBritches> Basically if they don't fire the halos then there is a 0% chance of life ever returning to the galaxy, whereas firing the rings at least gives some kind of a chance for life to come back
[3:59:15] <buster7800> being flooded is worse than death
[3:59:15] <%jiggy_snipe> its the last of last resorts LUL
[3:59:16] <+BrainOneOhOne> fire the Halo or will feed the flood
[3:59:16] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> To save the majority Woolie
[3:59:16] <%toadfinger> toadfinger subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[3:59:17] <dinnydanny777> The Rings are in THAT corner of space so that they can NEVER LEAVE THAT CORNER
[3:59:18] <%arkv01> also there are SPOILERS for how this plan actually works out in terms of common sense
[3:59:18] <Griffin1171> spoilers, but they literally mentioned an ark
[3:59:18] <penitentpentwitch> "We're losing the war. Might as well have hope for a future we won't see, than the doomed one we do see."
[3:59:19] <huskarl_zap> WHAT?! The dicdak?
[3:59:19] <ralphfromdk> Zombies are eating everything, let's kill every one instead of all of us becoming zombies...
[3:59:20] <%RioGascar> it was a last resort where we have no other ideas
[3:59:22] <%exnuart> "THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WROUGHT"
[3:59:22] <+moondog_> again 4 answers these questions
[3:59:22] <Catpurrple> @WoolieVersus "YOU DIDN'T WIN" is the point
[3:59:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> @woolieversus "LAST" RESORT
[3:59:23] <+maenos2> 343 literally said it was a last resort
[3:59:24] <TungstenViper> THEY LOST BIG TIME
[3:59:25] <duskrush> It's the predator armband self destruct
[3:59:25] <lotharrio> Seems like they decided to force a draw.
[3:59:26] <voodoolawyer> Aren't you like, awake aware and alive when you're infected by the flood?
[3:59:29] <Martiger434> Chat keep it in your pants with the spoilers
[3:59:29] <%cowardman93> it's not to save the forerunners, it's to make it that life can continue outside of the flood
[3:59:29] <ofalconer> Halo is basically the forerunners deciding the had to hold the L
[3:59:29] <Bigyanno> The galaxy is fucked, we are going to die anyway so why not fix the galaxy as we go?
[3:59:30] <Kato__v> Iirc, Halo Legends explained that the Forerunners preserved some species and set up a protocol to re-seed the galaxy with those preserved specimens
[3:59:30] <+Msytic6> Your questions will be answered in time
[3:59:31] <MoshPitMoira> @WoolieVersus It was a big "I'm takin' you with me!" situation
[3:59:32] <brachydios777> It was a long ass fight until thay decision
[3:59:32] <Equirah> They decided to be the last civilization to "die" to the flood
[3:59:33] <%DensityD> because of the implication
[3:59:35] <alastorpayne> LAST RESORT
[3:59:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> @voodoolawyer it seems sometimes mostly not
[3:59:37] <brachydios777> *that
[3:59:38] <irregularly_irregular> the LOGIC is that shit was dire enough to warrant it.
[3:59:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> "We're going to lose anyway, don't let them spread even further"
[3:59:40] <Goraka91> We all die but life goes on
[3:59:41] <+D00msDayDan> the logic plague is getting to woolie
[3:59:42] <bleugh> no, they jsut want to stop the flood
[3:59:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Woolie basically taking the Pat route. He’s rather be a toilet than stop mass infection.
[3:59:45] <%exnuart> THE FORERUNNERS LOST
[3:59:46] <+Bonerlord911> HOW IS THIS NOT A NET BENEFIT
[3:59:46] <$QueequegTheater> Yes
[3:59:46] <Saffry_Ruzin> It's because the Forerunners lost and had to use the Rings
[3:59:46] <stayinthepocket> He's thinking waaaaay to hard about this
[3:59:46] <+leviting> they had already lost, it was practically just spite
[3:59:47] <SoaringLettuce> woolie, this is like saying miles Dyson shouldn't have blown everything up cause he was dead anyway
[3:59:49] <+ggbhtg> Flood was up 9-0 @woolieversus
[3:59:50] <alrobot2014> Correct
[3:59:51] <Ashenik1> Benefit is maybe there will be life after destorying the flood
[3:59:51] <+CammerTime21> the benefit was that the flood didnt become the only species to exist ever
[3:59:51] <%RioGascar> there is no BENEFIT
[3:59:53] <%jiggy_snipe> yea Woolie
[3:59:53] <CiaraRoses> When the wave of one ring reaches another, it causes it to fire, like a chain reaction, so one ring firing means all fire eventually
[3:59:54] <%LavenderLaser> @voodoolawyer you feel it sapping your thoughts and memories until you're slowly assimilated
[3:59:54] <+MessyBristles> YES
[3:59:54] <%krispen_wa> EXACTLY
[3:59:55] <+Blarghnox> correct
[3:59:55] <%Lunatyr_> Yes
[3:59:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> IF FLOOD WIN, WHOLE UNIVERSE IS ASSIMILATED HELL FOREVER.
[3:59:56] <haitakaa> kill yourself to kill the flood
[3:59:56] <derap41> Oops all flood
[3:59:57] <%DensityD> it's not just a huge "you didn't win"
[3:59:57] <viciousgrim> Woolie remember "but you didn't win"
[3:59:57] <%arkv01> @WoolieVersus it will be answered if you're willing to play more :)
[3:59:58] <%RioGascar> ITS A LAST RESORT
[3:59:58] <%Nomad94> Yes
[3:59:58] <kulmoth> @WoolieVersus its more like okay we are doomed we are going to take you with us
[3:59:59] <Torivore> Woolie confirmed to betray you to save himself?
[4:00:01] <lexcorphr> it was a "you didn't win" situation
[4:00:01] <%stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Woolie considering the alternative is becoming a gross tentacle zombie...
[4:00:05] <voodoolawyer> Dude that's way worse than just dying
[4:00:05] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus sacrifice one galaxy to stop the flood ever leaving that galaxy
[4:00:12] <derap41> Flood are sapient at higher levels
[4:00:12] <brachydios777> They rather gamble on life rather it guaranteed be consumed
[4:00:14] <$tallik44123> woolie they just mentioned a ark
[4:00:17] <haitakaa> woolie blows my mind sometimes
[4:00:19] <Catpurrple> It will find all of it, pilot every spaceship, go everywhere it possibly can, so it's better to get rid of it now
[4:00:25] <CiaraRoses> @WoolieVersus When the wave of one ring reaches another, it causes it to fire, like a chain reaction, so one ring firing means all fire eventually
[4:00:26] <%DensityD> Prophet of Regret is such a bitch.
[4:00:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie is just trying to think through it
[4:00:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> They were no longer trying to save themselves they were just trying to preserve something ANYTHING for the future of the galaxy
[4:00:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> Hasnt the Flood eaten entire galaxies
[4:00:37] <duskrush> The zombie apocalypse is happening in Nebraska, so you nuke Nebraska, and the rest of the world is saved, basically
[4:00:37] <+ggbhtg> Flood was 9-0 in Grand Finals
[4:00:39] <%jiggy_snipe> the flood is a cancer and it will spread
[4:00:39] <+slimmixrp> No one wants to exist as a flood host
[4:00:41] <prime_name> Basically
[4:00:43] <derap41> The Flood isn't a blind consumer its Sapient
[4:00:44] <Adamotron> #Floodlife?
[4:00:45] <%Gruhunchously> Hungry boy
[4:00:46] <+Kqha4000> Forerunners all die so rest of galaxy can rebuild
[4:00:46] <%krispen_wa> Yeah essentially
[4:00:47] <%Proxzo> Floodlife
[4:00:47] <BlackermanZX> flood 4 life
[4:00:48] <%Lunatyr_> yeah
[4:00:50] <%arkv01> yes, zerg it up
[4:00:52] <Halospaz117> Basically, they already lost by the time they decided they needed to fire the rings
[4:00:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hence, the "Flood"
[4:00:53] <sendart> they will ....flood across the galaxy
[4:00:54] <Ardyn_1zunia> The Forerunners didn't know the Flood would survive in hibernation after activating the rings
[4:00:54] <$serpenttucker> Its more to give consideration to what comes next. It's not about your own races sustainability, it is about being a decent person and not letting ALL LIFE FOREVER get fucked
[4:00:55] <$QueequegTheater> The Floodlife chose me
[4:00:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @duskrush what if Ohio is infected
[4:00:57] <%Proxzo> Thuglife
[4:00:57] <+green715> Being a zombie probably isn't fun either
[4:00:57] <SoaringLettuce> life as a flood host is torture
[4:00:58] <%GrumbleGrouse> heat death of The Flood
[4:00:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> FLOOD IT UP
[4:00:59] <%dekkitout> This concept hits different after I saw End of Eva last night...
[4:00:59] <voodoolawyer> If only he played Mass Effect, cause isn't the Ark and Halos basically just ME3's Liara Message?
[4:00:59] <%DensityD> @WoolieVersus you did so well through Halo 2. Thanks for going on Heroic
[4:01:04] <Goraka91> If you're not aware, they lost
[4:01:05] <MetaChiefVoices> if the flood reach their ultimate stage they can 'infect' reality using precursor neuroscience
[4:01:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie obviously did not hear the 1 teaser from Spark and isn't putting 2 and 2 together, despite his religious familiarity
[4:01:05] <satans_finest_millennial> #FloodLife
[4:01:06] <%Tuna_Can_0> Billions and billions and billions and billions
[4:01:08] <%Proxzo> FloodLyfe
[4:01:08] <idiotscampaign> the loss of biodiversity in the galaxy
[4:01:08] <TungstenViper> basically RACCOON CITY getting nuked
[4:01:11] <subjectg> the flood would consume the entire universe if left unchecked
[4:01:11] <stayinthepocket> Fuck it I'm Floodgang now
[4:01:16] <lotharrio> Could feed on itself, or raise entire sentient species as a food source.
[4:01:18] <haitakaa> grave mind is the flood
[4:01:19] <brachydios777> It was basically a dice role for the Forerunners, hope life goes on or the Flood is guaranteed to win
[4:01:19] <%Slimshazbot> The real plot inconsistency is why they even bothered keeping flood in containment
[4:01:21] <+slimmixrp> didn't they retcon that the rings kill flood too, but their small spores can survive the blast?
[4:01:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Admiral_PopnFresh is it even a spoiler if we just say "the ark" to Woolie?
[4:01:22] <Griffin1171> I assume the flood would start farms
[4:01:22] <Saffry_Ruzin> Gravemind-Chan wants the Galaxy
[4:01:24] <viciousgrim> or they move to another galaxy
[4:01:25] <duskrush> @LiquidDinosaur you build 7 rings for Nebraska AND Ohio, to save Kansas
[4:01:26] <+Blarghnox> it does kill the flood too
[4:01:29] <%jiggy_snipe> @TungstenViper another good comparison
[4:01:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @duskrush but its all ohio
[4:01:34] <+Bonerlord911> it does kill the flood too
[4:01:34] <dinnydanny777> There are OTHER GALAXIES dude
[4:01:35] <Griffin1171> human farms
[4:01:36] <TheYellowcouch> all your questions will be answered in halo 4
[4:01:38] <idiotscampaign> remember that ine episode of Space Dandy?
[4:01:38] <IntrepidEye> There was a retcon here where the rings actually do kill higher level flood but possibly not the spores and infectors
[4:01:39] <bleugh> why does the evolve back thing matter, they just want to stop the flood
[4:01:39] <+Ropcord> also shield worlds are a thing
[4:01:40] <dinnydanny777> It wipes out 1 galaxy
[4:01:41] <%DensityD> god bless Kansas
[4:01:41] <%Pyroclase> So did the Halos kill the dinosaurs?
[4:01:41] <MetaChiefVoices> Mice are not fine
[4:01:41] <zocano> It is *truly* for the greater good
[4:01:43] <%Gruhunchously> Halo confirmed as Hitchhikers Guide prequel.
[4:01:43] <%DensityD> I'm in Kansas
[4:01:44] <+ggbhtg> Life is a fuck
[4:01:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @jorniev
[4:01:45] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @slimshazbot because they were cocky. they explain it in halo 1 terminals
[4:01:46] <dinnydanny777> It wipes out one corner of space.
[4:01:47] <%xeromage> Sentient Life I thought. Does it need to manipulate thinking creatures?
[4:01:49] <%dekkitout> @LiquidDinosaur Always has been
[4:01:50] <+Bonerlord911> cortana was wrong in halo 1, it absolutely kills flood too
[4:01:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Life other than me exists?! BAKANA
[4:01:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Pyroclase yes
[4:01:53] <zocano> The ultimate For the Greater Good
[4:01:54] <Divryne> V make sure to mention the Ark later in Halo 3.
[4:01:55] <vulkan_vibes> it's the idea of setting the evolutionary clock back millions of years instead of billions
[4:01:55] <+aphotophilic> sacrifice galaxy to save the universe
[4:01:56] <irregularly_irregular> I mean... there was literally no other choice, my dude. You HAVE to hope things can come back from it.
[4:01:56] <bubbli97> so was the first activation what killed the dinosaurs? since mamals were like mice size
[4:01:56] <subjectg> Mice are most definitely NOT fine
[4:01:57] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus also: sacrifice one galaxy to prevent the flood from ever leaving to eat other galaxies
[4:01:57] <+TheDandyGuy> it's life considered on a galactic, massive scale
[4:01:58] <%DensityD> Masaka!
[4:01:59] <dinnydanny777> It only wipes out the part of space where the flood were left in
[4:01:59] <$ZeOrbling> @WoolieVersus you just need to continue the story, your questions get answered
[4:01:59] <drewslo> forerunners also thought that the flood would die in hibernation they apparently we're wrong
[4:02:00] <+CptBritches> It's better than letting the flood take over and have literally 0% chance
[4:02:01] <duskrush> All of Ohio gets destroyed but Billy survives to rebuild Ohio
[4:02:05] <+Kqha4000> Mice are not safe
[4:02:05] <Saffry_Ruzin> Hunter Worms survive too
[4:02:06] <+Tucker1149> @WoolieVersus When you get the chance and complete Halo 3 and maybe ODST you should watch Halo Legends which is an assortment of short stories and different animation styles giving some more lore to the games as well as some background on the Creation of The rings.
[4:02:06] <akman14> I am at PRIMORTIAL SOUP
[4:02:08] <correctedsun117> Has The Mantle of Responsibility been brought up yet?
[4:02:09] <+ggbhtg> Life is a fuck, 410 billion dead flood
[4:02:10] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus There's also additional info that makes it less crazy but can't be explained yet because spoilers
[4:02:11] <voodoolawyer> Ohio is not worth saving
[4:02:12] <+Kqha4000> Everything gets wiped
[4:02:12] <HorribleHog> It's a pretty bad plant tbh
[4:02:12] <Bigyanno> It would be so easy to explain this shit but you would have to spoil things
[4:02:14] <zocano> @correctedsun117 no
[4:02:15] <Jrockoni> its waying existence as a whole vs your civilization
[4:02:15] <Kato__v> Shield worlds, my dude
[4:02:16] <balquisa> ohio are the forerunners
[4:02:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Ropcord Wait it's all Sentinals?
[4:02:17] <VidulaSaix> It's better to bank on the chance than the guarantee that life ends if you do nothing @WoolieVersus
[4:02:17] <Goraka91> Last resort means LAST RESORT
[4:02:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Flip the board and pass the torch to the next player.
[4:02:18] <jorniev> wasnt there like multiple grave minds with the fore runners!?
[4:02:18] <+phatmac16> Why couldn’t they make Halo only kill the Flood?
[4:02:20] <derap41> Fermi Paradox Woo1
[4:02:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @LiquidDinosaur you right, I find it it odd he doesn't even to seem to recognize it, AT ALL, it would obviously answer this confusion he's having
[4:02:24] <$serpenttucker> It's about making sure their is a future for the universe, not about self preservation for your own species. It feels weird to me that Woolie would be this confused when he played outer wilds
[4:02:24] <+D00msDayDan> @correctedsun117 mantle is implied in 3's terminals and not explicilty mentioned until 4
[4:02:25] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I mean theoretically if bacteria exist then them evolving to sentient life is inevitable
[4:02:25] <%exnuart> activate halo or become flood
[4:02:26] <%Nomad94> Spoilerchat
[4:02:27] <Lieutenant_America> The Flood is WORSE. That's the long and short.
[4:02:29] <SuperFightinRobot> The thing is that at that point, everything was probably already lost.
[4:02:29] <voodoolawyer> I would light the sacred rings to destroy Ohio even in a peaceful galaxy
[4:02:30] <Saffry_Ruzin> Hunter Worms can survive the rings
[4:02:31] <Dean_Inbetween> Well it we’ll inevitably happen life will find a way given enough time
[4:02:33] <%jiggy_snipe> it was the first solution Kappa
[4:02:33] <%DensityD> woolie loves the Ark
[4:02:34] <Djinnazz> *Break glass if all is fucked*
[4:02:36] <seniormeatbox> Guilty Spark literally said "After every other strategic option was exhausted"
[4:02:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @phatmac16 They tried that
[4:02:37] <lotharrio> Woolie, a guy kills your entire family and stabbed you in the lung. You blow up your house to make sure when you die, he goes with you.
[4:02:38] <brachydios777> It was THE last resort
[4:02:43] <+Msytic6> There is an answer!
[4:02:44] <+Yawhn> Questioning the resort is indeed the plot of Halo
[4:02:44] <vulkan_vibes> it's the idea of setting the evolutionary clock back millions of years instead of billions, ya know?
[4:02:45] <Djinnazz> They tried everything else woolie.
[4:02:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> WOOLIE THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIOP BETWEEN ARKS AND FLOODS
[4:02:47] <%Irridium> it was literally the last possible resort
[4:02:48] <%Slimshazbot> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug To be fair, Halo Anniversay terminals is 6 games later than that should really be explained by
[4:02:49] <irregularly_irregular> the fuck kinda analogy is that... Jesus.
[4:02:49] <stayinthepocket> Woolie would prefer to be part of the zombie hivemind
[4:02:49] <duskrush> There was straight up no other way at the time. It's the predator wristband on a galactic scale
[4:02:49] <+Msytic6> in halo 4
[4:02:50] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> These questions might come up and get answered in the future games!
[4:02:50] <%CptnCampy61> Halo Legends gives a clear answer
[4:02:50] <+JustToWatch> You can't lose everything when everything has already been lost
[4:02:53] <+Invertin> @WoolieVersus sacrifice one galaxy to prevent the flood from ever leaving to eat other galaxies
[4:02:54] <voodoolawyer> The Forerunners had Pat Logic
[4:02:54] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Its the ultimate Sacrifice now to save the future
[4:02:58] <thaprinnydood> watch halo legends
[4:03:00] <MetaChiefVoices> the flood can infect EVERYTHING
[4:03:00] <%DensityD> Didn't Guilty Spark say "the last time the installation was activated"?
[4:03:00] <Goraka91> The Forerunners wouldn't activate the Halos if they were winning
[4:03:03] <%Skyebaker> watch halo legends done
[4:03:04] <brachydios777> The Forerunners lost hard
[4:03:04] <VidulaSaix> SYMBOLISM
[4:03:05] <asd2897> it kind of does
[4:03:06] <duskrush> oh WOW I never caught that!
[4:03:09] <%DensityD> time me out
[4:03:10] <haitakaa> the forerunners seeded life throughout the Galaxy
[4:03:12] <%Gruhunchously> Symbolism
[4:03:13] <+yhom_tork> OH MY GOD
[4:03:13] <drewslo> also kill the galaxy to save the other ones
[4:03:14] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> OH MY GOD THATS WHY ITS CALLED THE FLOOD
[4:03:15] <asd2897> halo legends touches on that
[4:03:16] <voodoolawyer> They should've called it "The Ark"
[4:03:17] <%NovaKnightmare> Its almost like thats what happened
[4:03:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie is just working through it in his head
[4:03:18] <%ElbyBoxus> who is john
[4:03:18] <Bigyanno> That is EXACTLY what happened
[4:03:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> "oh fuck its the face melting ind of ark"

[4:04:43] <%RunningNGunning> Wait a game called Halo has religious symbolism?
[4:04:44] <+casualbaloth> didn't the monitor in the heretic clips say that the covenant alien species existed before the firing of the ring?

[4:04:50] <+Yawhn> John Christ
[4:04:50] <dinnydanny777> Woolie we are talking about sacrificing one galaxy to save the entire universe from assimilation to a lovecraftian hicemind
[4:04:50] <Bigyanno> You could know quite quickly if you just play Halo 3 now
[4:04:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ggbhtg Noahs Ark is any Abrahamic religion and technically they got it from the Mesopotamian religion since Gilgamesh goes to chill with Noah after his boyfriend dies
[4:04:51] <%Gruhunchously> The protags name is literally John 117
[4:04:52] <halfmasks> Read John 1:17 for th efull thing

[4:04:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'm sure we could explain the plot if we used fighting game analogies
[4:04:59] <HorribleHog> Tbf it seems to be religious symbolism more in the vein of Evangelion
[4:04:59] <brachydios777> Woolie is actually on the right track
[4:05:00] <correctedsun117> Joseph Staten, the Cinematics director for Halo, had a Master's in Religious Theory

[4:28:25] <%hattrick61> ROKETO PUNCH
[4:28:32] <%RadicalWeegee> ITS THE BEST
[4:28:33] <prime_name> Big O is so good
[4:28:34] <+Estuko> @voodoolawyer I love LP2 it's one of my all time favorite games.
[4:28:36] <+someguy1472> Show is more dramatic, book is more realistic. Ship travel takes weeks in the books while in the show it looks pretty instant.
[4:28:36] <PanicSwytch> No love for 08th MS team?
[4:28:36] <%dekkitout> Eva 2's shoulder spikes are also rad
[4:28:37] <LoganPayne> Gundam Heavyarms is a portmanteau of Gun and Gun
[4:28:37] <%jiggy_snipe> Heavy Arms is the best, too bad it runs out of ammo =/
[4:28:37] <%DensityD> CAST IN THE NAME OF GOD
[4:28:39] <+penjaza> Maybe do a Getting Into Fighting Games with Garrison Archangel (which is a ZoE mech game)
[4:28:39] <%arkv01> pile bunker
[4:28:39] <UltimateDomon> YE NOT GUILTY
[4:28:40] <%paladinstarbuster> escafliwne

[4:28:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> Big O is GOAT
[4:28:41] <%DensityD> YE BE NOT GUILTY
[4:28:51] <voodoolawyer> I stan Lost Planet 2 all the goddamn time everywhere I go no matter what and it deserved so much more love than it got
[4:28:53] <Mothman742> PILEBUNKER OR DRILL
[4:28:57] <%Pyroclase> It's coming to the MCC soon
[4:29:01] <voodoolawyer> I would LP it if I had a copy
[4:29:07] <FiendishlyInventive> @Chat- What about Day At The Beach? Extra Blur Cutscene.
[4:29:08] <Bigyanno> ODST will be on MCC eventually
[4:29:08] <Catpurrple> Yeah, just wait for it to come to MCC.
[4:29:08] <+Kqha4000> ODSt will be coming to pc
[4:29:09] <%Irridium> could just wait for the PC release
[4:29:09] <%DensityD> @voodoolawyer capcom has forgotten :(
[4:29:10] <Dorkoblin> Woolie will figure it out.
[4:29:10] <+JeluxDaCasual> ODST so good
[4:29:11] <Jazzmaster_j> It's coming to MCC???
[4:29:12] <Halospaz117> Isn't ODST next on the PC schedule?
[4:29:12] <Dorkoblin> heh

[4:29:14] <Bigyanno> can't wait for ODST on pC
[4:29:14] <+Fenrein> It's coming to MCC soon enough
[4:29:14] <seniormeatbox> WOOLIE WILL FIGURE IT OUT
[4:29:15] <+Estuko> @voodoolawyer I will always regret never getting that Salamander plush, it hurts my fucking soul
[4:29:17] <+einherjarvalk> ODST the best
[4:29:23] <Catpurrple> ODST comes next, then Halo 4.
[4:29:26] <+JeluxDaCasual> ODST THE BEST!
[4:29:27] <brachydios777> You like Jazz chat?
[4:29:29] <Radioactivetaco9> ODST should be the next one to be ported to PC
[4:29:31] <Captain_sevatar> ODST has some big feels
[4:29:32] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus At the current rate ODST will be on the PC in like a month
[4:29:38] <subjectg> I think ODST will come with firefight so that’ll be fun
[4:29:39] <%alpacasintophats> ok but what about REACH though?!
[4:29:39] <therealtacopancakes> odst and then reach
[4:29:41] <voodoolawyer> God I knew y'all were good company. I miss Lost Planet 2
[4:29:42] <%DensityD> Woolie, sell me some natural under arm deodorant.
[4:29:46] <+D00msDayDan> odst will be on pc by the time he beats 3
[4:29:46] <%alpacasintophats> like ODST is great
[4:29:50] <%alpacasintophats> but REACH
[4:29:53] <haitakaa> do aliens exist in any Gundam spin-off?
[4:29:54] <+Lord_Kryos> Wow I am so very very very late :(
[4:29:57] <%DensityD> HCAER
[4:30:04] <galagoth> ODST is the best Halo
[4:30:05] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> ODST uses a very similar engine to H3 and should be on PC very soon
[4:30:08] <$QueequegTheater> 1>2>3>ODST>Reach>4>literally nothing else
[4:30:15] <%DensityD> Halo wars 2 is the Best Halo
[4:30:19] <+someguy1472> What was actually wrong with 5?
[4:30:20] <+katarjin> oo so late
[4:30:21] <+penjaza> I finished a co-op Halo 3 campaign a couple days ago
[4:30:23] <Captain_sevatar> Shroedingers connection
[4:30:26] <Crimmy115> There are aliens in the Gundam 00 movie haitakaa
[4:30:27] <Goraka91> Halo Wars has some good cutscenes
[4:30:29] <voodoolawyer> Reggie and Ming for Bluey and Smoothman Elites!
[4:30:31] <%alpacasintophats> @someguy1472 the story was ***BAD***

[4:30:37] <brachydios777> @queequegtheater What if Infinite is good?
[4:30:41] <haitakaa> I really want to see woolie try multiplayer versus
[4:30:43] <%alpacasintophats> @someguy1472 gunplay is actually decent though
[4:30:46] <huskarl_zap> Can you watch infinite and not expect spoilers? Like the whole plot of the last game?
[4:30:50] <huskarl_zap> Big johns
[4:30:51] <$QueequegTheater> @brachydios777 Then it will pretend 5 didn't happen
[4:30:51] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> What... No
[4:30:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> THE BIGGEST JOHN
[4:30:55] <%jiggy_snipe> Lucky John LUL
[4:30:57] <%DensityD> He can ALWAYS FIND A GUN
[4:30:57] <akman14> Genetic Luck?
[4:30:59] <%Gruhunchously> 10 Luck
[4:31:01] <%DensityD> THE BOMB DIDN'T MISS
[4:31:01] <Goraka91> Luck is not an observable statistic
[4:31:02] <KaitlynnHere> ....
[4:31:03] <balquisa> Fallout luck skill: 10
[4:31:05] <+someguy1472> I should check it out on youtube sometimes. I really slept on everything after Halo 3.
[4:31:06] <voodoolawyer> Spartan 117 had the BIGGEST JOHNS
[4:31:08] <Captain_sevatar> Exceptional child soldiers
[4:31:09] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Spartans were chosen due to them being the top 1% of genetic makeup
[4:31:10] <huskarl_zap> Exceptional 6 year olds
[4:31:10] <%arkv01> the FASTEST john
[4:31:11] <brachydios777> @queequegtheater Seems legit
[4:31:13] <duskrush> Lucky John

[4:31:14] <Halospaz117> Lucky Ted 117
[4:31:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> John is Lucky Ted!
[4:31:14] <$QueequegTheater> @Goraka91 It is with John
[4:31:16] <lotharrio> 0 stats but 50 in luck.
[4:31:16] <%Tuna_Can_0> Lucky Ted Build PogChamp
[4:31:19] <subjectg> Fall of Reach is a cool book about the biggest war crimes
[4:31:20] <RamenRiderZ> You could say he was BLESSED
[4:31:20] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL LUL
[4:31:20] <%laserbeaming> how do you measure luck?
[4:31:21] <%SirGO0SE> thats 100% true and THE TEST IS A LITERAL COIN FLIP
[4:31:21] <+Ropcord> LUL
[4:31:21] <+Yakobro> LOL
[4:31:21] <Dean_Inbetween> Oh yeah halo wars and halo wars 2 maybe a thing for playing infinite
[4:31:22] <Captain_sevatar> I would be fuckin done
[4:31:22] <+barrakuta371> Lucky Ted Halo
[4:31:24] <galagoth> what no it was due to genes
[4:31:24] <Sullry> BASED
[4:31:25] <brachydios777> Literally Lucky Ted

[4:31:27] <%laserbeaming> GET ASLAN'D
[4:31:29] <%eggypigeon> CHANGE IT
[4:31:29] <%ringabal> John Halo takes a knee at the Superbowl
[4:31:31] <%Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4 thank ya jesus
[4:31:32] <penitentpentwitch> Remove Helmet, It's Jesus
[4:31:32] <Shardlab> They were all apex, bigger than the others
[4:31:33] <AlexandriasFolly> HALO IS BIBBLE GAMES
[4:31:34] <+Lord_Kryos> There is a christian ODST tho
[4:31:34] <resloxxx> LUL
[4:31:37] <+RaveBV> John wasn't picked for luck. The reason why he was chosen for holding Cortana is because she deemed him lucy.
[4:31:38] <Halospaz117> The real Halo was Jesus all along
[4:31:38] <brachydios777> But he is the savior
[4:31:39] <+HeroicGamerGuy> Johnny Ted
[4:31:39] <$QueequegTheater> Unless Jesus is shaped like a thicc cyber wife
[4:31:40] <ashenjuan25> Lucky Tedd halo
[4:31:42] <Pnutz409> lol
[4:31:42] <TungstenViper> LET'S SAVE ALL THE ANIMALS
[4:31:47] <voodoolawyer> lucy
[4:31:47] <+RaveBV> lucky*
[4:31:48] <Goraka91> @QueequegTheater I get that ''Hey you're metaphorically lucky because Cortana picked you'' but having him be retconned to actually be Lucky Ted is bizzare LUL
[4:31:49] <%arkv01> are you ready for the flood... in my pants ;) ????
[4:31:53] <Pnutz409> Hahaah
[4:31:56] <+Estuko> He takes off his armour and it reveals that he had a rosary with a cross on him the ENTIRE time, and his tattood back says "JESUS IS MY SAVIOR"
[4:31:57] <+HeroicGamerGuy> Lucky John Halo
[4:31:57] <undercoverbarber> Watch the BELIEVE trailer
[4:31:59] <$QueequegTheater> @Goraka91 No it's the best
[4:32:02] <haitakaa> that's why Cortana chose John
[4:32:03] <mr_sups> Crowbar!
[4:32:05] <%Tuna_Can_0> PogChamp
[4:32:06] <KaitlynnHere> @arkv01 no
[4:32:08] <ashenjuan25> John halo prays at the end
[4:32:09] <Shardlab> John could win King of the Hill with even older kids before he was kidnapped and trained
[4:32:10] <brian_peppers1> YOU AINT SEEN NOTHING YET
[4:32:12] <Radioactivetaco9> well melee in halo 2 is easily the worst melee in all of halo
[4:32:14] <TimetodiveLTX> up and down and all around
[4:32:16] <%laserbeaming> Amid Evil has fantastic melee
[4:32:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Yamatowbar
[4:32:17] <$QueequegTheater> The crowbar is not a fair comparison
[4:32:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @estuko no, het
[4:32:20] <%ringabal> How can a big crowbar have so few frames
[4:32:21] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> ahhh
[4:32:22] <balquisa> half is cool guy eh kils the combain and doesn
[4:32:25] <%DensityD> Every grenade thrown in Cursed Halo mod, a random effect, perhaps a nuke, perhaps more enemies, perhaps even a laser disco party!
[4:32:31] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah Doom eternal really de-enforced melee
[4:32:32] <DianaTheAscian> do we warn woolie about odst melee?
[4:32:33] <+Fenrein> @Radioactivetaco9 Halo CE doesn't have a lunge attached
[4:32:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[4:32:33] <akman14> Woolie doesn't swing
[4:32:33] <%arkv01> well uh guess I can't finish the fight then
[4:32:33] <+Lord_Kryos> Halo 3 flood explode to melee
[4:32:34] <%DensityD> D20 grenades
[4:32:41] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Spartans were chosen due to them being the top tier of genetic makeup in the human gene pool. Literally the best of the best of humanity
[4:32:43] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @estuko he takes off the mask to reveal he was Jesus the whole time
[4:32:44] <voodoolawyer> H3 Melee has a bit of a lunge
[4:32:46] <%alpacasintophats> you can punch flood in the flood bits and kill them instantly on legendary
[4:32:47] <voodoolawyer> so it's better
[4:32:52] <haitakaa> also radar
[4:32:55] <subjectg> @densityd or an instant TOS violation!
[4:32:57] <%DomunDomunDomun> John being lucky isn't a retcon, it was in the fall of reach, literally the first piece of halo media released.
[4:32:57] <+Estuko> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug lmfao, I was relaly conused for a second LUL
[4:33:03] <%DensityD> LuL
[4:33:08] <Goraka91> Spartans are ubermench created to oppress some farmers huh
[4:33:11] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Among the Spartans, John is not the smartest, fastest, or strongest, just the luckiest
[4:33:13] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @estuko damn enter key right next to backspace on mobile
[4:33:14] <%DensityD> BLUR
[4:33:19] <%DensityD> DO EET
[4:33:22] <huskarl_zap> 343 written movie
[4:33:23] <Halospaz117> NOT WRONG
[4:33:23] <voodoolawyer> DO FEET
[4:33:23] <balquisa> There's already 2 halo movies
[4:33:26] <%Pyroclase> Overwatch should've been a movie too.
[4:33:31] <%arkv01> HEY LOL: The Moobie
[4:33:31] <$usotaku013666> I remember reading somewhere that Spartans are incapable of believing in a higher power because they are conditioned to believe they are the strongest in the galaxy. They can't believe anything would be more powerful than them.
[4:33:32] <$QueequegTheater> WAR POETRY
[4:33:32] <%krispen_wa> BLUR should do the KOTOR movies
[4:33:35] <+RaveBV> Spartans were kidnapped as children and made into actual Spartens. They had special genes as to why they were chosen for the program. Cortana had the option to pick any Spartan to take care of her and SHE chose John over his luck after the fact.
[4:33:36] <KeystoneA2> !uptime
[4:33:36] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 43 minutes
[4:33:38] <brachydios777> @goraka91 Civil War went real bad
[4:33:39] <Captain_sevatar> Yup
[4:33:50] <lotharrio> Non-infectious, but yeah sorta.
[4:33:51] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @goraka91 the unsc would be super fascists if the covenant didn't come and prove them immediately right
[4:33:52] <+Fenrein> They are just a hivemind
[4:33:52] <prime_name> oh yeah
[4:33:53] <%MacabreOpus> I would rather Goodbye Kansas animate a Halo movie, their work is incredible
[4:33:53] <%DensityD> Hunters are basically Treants from LotR
[4:33:57] <Halospaz117> huh
[4:33:57] <correctedsun117> They're like the drones
[4:34:03] <%Tuna_Can_0> they just dont eat others
[4:34:03] <%Gruhunchously> LIVE IN IGNORANCE AND PURCHASE YOUR HAPPINESS
[4:34:05] <%krispen_wa> WORMMIND
[4:34:07] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Yes you have, it's called a Scarab
[4:34:10] <lotharrio> Haven't seen an infected Hunter either, huh?
[4:34:10] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 True, the Insurgency was SUPER bad, but man child soldiers ain't the solution LUL
[4:34:11] <Shardlab> The Hunters are kludge mind colonies
[4:34:15] <%DensityD> smart, wise, but slow to act
[4:34:19] <Nevflinn> The opposite of humans, so
[4:34:22] <%laserbeaming> Oh... They're like Cranium Rats in Planescape
[4:34:24] <%alpacasintophats> Hunters are also effectively immune to the flood due to not having sufficient biomass for infection
[4:34:25] <penitentpentwitch> "No. I'm hungry."
[4:34:25] <%DensityD> GRAVEMIND LOVES IT
[4:34:26] <%krispen_wa> NO
[4:34:26] <Djinnazz> nope, gotta eat.
[4:34:28] <Captain_sevatar> Nope gotta eat em all
[4:34:30] <%Irridium> but he hungry
[4:34:31] <%ringabal> Mans gotta eat
[4:34:31] <DeepSearch27> NAH
[4:34:33] <%DensityD> must eet
[4:34:33] <Nevflinn> @lotharrio The Hunters are basically Flood if they were good guys
[4:34:33] <%jiggy_snipe> must consume
[4:34:34] <+Extrallent> But that's what it wants
[4:34:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> uh, Gravemind chooses to eat
[4:34:35] <akman14> Nuh, i don't think i will
[4:34:36] <kulmoth> but he hongryy
[4:34:37] <prince_johnny_> No
[4:34:37] <+jeasybakeoven> but what if thats the thing he wants to do
[4:34:38] <%Gruhunchously> Nah, I'm hungry
[4:34:39] <duskrush> He's not gonna
[4:34:39] <balquisa> but then again, without kidnapped super soldier humanity would be extinct
[4:34:41] <DeepSearch27> he's SUPER into it tho
[4:34:41] <%BisoromiBear> Stop being delicious
[4:34:42] <Radioactivetaco9> Originally the heretics in the first arbiter mission were suppossed to be hunters but they changed there mind because a level full of hunters wouldve been kinda hard
[4:34:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus GRAVEMIND CHOOSES TO BE EVIL
[4:34:43] <subjectg> nope, that’s exactly wha the wants
[4:34:44] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> but it wants all of it
[4:34:44] <Shardlab> Woolie.... Carrion comes out tomorrow
[4:34:45] <IndoorSitup> GUY'S GOTTA EAT
[4:34:45] <+HabeasTortoise> dude checkers, you gotta eat
[4:34:45] <FreedomARX7> Must. Be. Whole.
[4:34:45] <PraiseHemra> THE LORD HUNGERS
[4:34:46] <%Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus Just because it's intelligent doesn't mean it's smart
[4:34:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUT I'M HUNGRY AND WANT TO BE EVERYONE
[4:34:48] <voodoolawyer> It likes poetry, dude. He's probably a pretentious asshole.
[4:34:48] <KaitlynnHere> But he loves it tho
[4:34:49] <$serpenttucker> Maybe he is just an asshole
[4:34:49] <drewslo> gravemind lives to hate, eat, and lie
[4:34:49] <+Ozmodyas> It's like that guy from Spider Man who wants to turn people into Dinosaurs, it's just what he wants to do
[4:34:49] <GrandmasterBFunk> it's smart enough to know that it doesn't give a shit about what others want
[4:34:52] <%raven_frame> There may be something more to that.
[4:34:53] <brachydios777> @goraka91 Honestly Halsey was lucky Aliens showed up to justify her project more
[4:34:53] <FiendishlyInventive> HE LOVES IT
[4:34:54] <Captain_sevatar> It is our own fault for being so damn delicious
[4:34:55] <AMUSERNAME> FEED ME, SEYMOUR
[4:34:56] <Sullry> hes petty as fuck
[4:34:59] <Shwepie> Guy says, "No, I hangry!"

[4:35:02] <%ringabal> THE LAAAAAAWD HUNGERS
[4:35:03] <%DensityD> "or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"
[4:35:04] <AlexandriasFolly> Gravemind BIG HUNGRY
[4:35:04] <Pnutz409> Gravemind doesnt give a fuk.
[4:35:05] <bearalin> You assume it’s reasonable
[4:35:09] <Shardlab> You will see the world through the eyes of a kludge mind monster
[4:35:12] <voodoolawyer> Feed Both Mouths
[4:35:14] <black_pariah> THERE WERE FIXING SHIPS
[4:35:23] <Dean_Inbetween> A quantum computer need a regular computer with fundamental coding driving it to work so.. @woolieversus

[4:35:32] <%DensityD> psa2guy
[4:35:33] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 I was interested in 5 maybe showing the more seedy side of humanity, but nah have a generic robot war instead
[4:35:35] <%ringabal> Gravemind is the least discerning gormet
[4:35:38] <zocano> It has a motive
[4:35:38] <bleugh> mass effect also ripped off halo
[4:35:39] <$QueequegTheater> @haitakaa yes

[4:36:05] <Daxalog> Most people get got by one.
[4:36:07] <brachydios777> @goraka91 5 will go down as the black sheep of the franchise
[4:36:08] <%BinaryFireball> totally not puking
[4:36:09] <huskarl_zap> spineless cowards win against the flood
[4:36:10] <Djinnazz> It only takes one.
[4:36:10] <Halospaz117> "Hey girl lemme grab yo liver"
[4:36:11] <$QueequegTheater> And Halo ripped off the tyranids, which ripped off Aliens, which ripped off the nightgaunts from Lovecraft

[4:36:21] <subjectg> @goraka91 i still think it was a big waste to have ONI not be the secret enemy faction
[4:36:22] <penitentpentwitch> Halo: The aliens are not the problem. It's the other aliens that are the problem. And the aliens jailing those aliens have a solution that's also a problem.
[4:36:23] <prime_name> SMELLS LIKE BITCH
[4:36:25] <+RaveBV> Did anyone ever clear up the Forerunner's reason for Halo to woolie, or does he still think they nuked everything with no plan?

[4:36:54] <eldragon_1> The Master Chief perspective makes them look a lot smaller than they actually are

[4:39:01] <Ashenik1> That is the witcher problem, great writing in all the games but gameplay is ....
[4:39:01] <%RioGascar> its not even that hard to catchup to halo
[4:39:04] <%SableS139a> @ringabal Mood. >feelsbadman
[4:39:06] <ralphfromdk> At least you have the MCC to play, you don't have to dig out a 360 and halo 1 and 2 discs...

[4:39:42] <exileshadow03> @WoolieVersus I have a friend whose first avengers film was endgame...it was painful watching it with them only to have them go "Man these movies are overrated".
[4:39:43] <Goraka91> Imagine using slugs LUL
[4:39:44] <$QueequegTheater> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Halo 4 IS the best one
[4:39:45] <UvBenServed> "So uncivilized" - Elites probably
[4:39:48] <KaitlynnHere> Aliens are pretty cool
[4:39:54] <lotharrio> Stargate SG-1 had that element of "energy weapons aren't automatically the best."
[4:40:00] <%hattrick61> Thats a baby toy
[4:40:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @exileshadow03 You mean ex-friend?

[4:40:13] <drewslo> brute technology level was slipspace then they nukes themselves back to industrial
[4:40:17] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @liquiddinosaur Halo 6: they activate the rings and it switches to a new universe where Chief and Arbiter are already besties
[4:40:21] <Goraka91> @lotharrio Yo that scene where they slam on the staff weapons in favour of P90s was great
[4:40:22] <RamenRiderZ> "Wow these idiots still shoot metal"
[4:40:26] <Drarrk> considering human weapons kill them just as much as their weapons kill humans, it's clearly doing something right
[4:40:27] <Captain_sevatar> The brutes knew what was up
[4:40:30] <%DensityD> throwing with THE POWER OF EXPLOSIONS
[4:40:30] <hologram_sam> how bout: fast metal ??

[4:40:51] <huskarl_zap> Bitch I see your missionaries
[4:40:53] <KaitlynnHere> How about heavy metal?
[4:40:56] <ralphfromdk> We use magnets aka metal, to shoot other kinds of metal real fucking fast !!
[4:40:56] <%D0ct0r22> that's some stellaris talk if i've ever heard it
[4:40:57] <%DensityD> the high ground
[4:41:00] <brachydios777> Brute hype for Infinite!

[4:41:05] <huskarl_zap> I see your missionaies on my halo
[4:41:11] <Captain_sevatar> gotta diversify your fleet
[4:41:14] <Dean_Inbetween> Like a laser is useful but how much more useful is it than a super sonic projectile that already kills you instantly ALREADY
[4:41:16] <hologram_sam> When they had ammo for weapons they threw out that concept
[4:41:17] <%hattrick61> Accelerate grains of sand to Light speed

[4:41:35] <$serpenttucker> And thus functionally has no ammo

[4:43:53] <+the_krypto_knight> I didn't really go PS4 for a specific game, but its had some solid exclusives. Definitely p5 was worth for me
[4:43:53] <KaitlynnHere> I’d bought my PS4 for horizon zero dawn

[4:45:15] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> YEAH BUT ARBITER SAID MACLUNKY THO
[4:45:16] <%jiggy_snipe> also the only reason the heretic had an opening to fire was because arby considered his words. If the arby wasn't gonna consider it then he wouldn't pause therefore the heretic wouldn't have an opening
[4:45:18] <exileshadow03> @WoolieVersus Wouldn't that be like trying to reason with a Jehovas Witness?
[4:45:18] <%BisoromiBear> actions speak louder than retcons
[4:45:18] <%Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus Keep in mind the station was also plummeting into the gas giant at the time, not a lot of time to talk
[4:45:25] <+ImperiledRed> Weren't they falling?
[4:45:28] <Captain_sevatar> That shoot you?!
[4:45:30] <IndoorSitup> MACKLUNKEY
[4:45:31] <DeepSearch27> HMMM
[4:45:32] <%DensityD> you taste the poison
[4:45:46] <IndoorSitup> M A C K L U N K E Y
[4:45:51] <correctedsun117> WHEN?
[4:45:51] <%jiggy_snipe> you gotta just talk like Tartarus so we know it doesn't work
[4:45:52] <huskarl_zap> when you need an Emperor of Mankind
[4:45:53] <+the_krypto_knight> So heretic is Arby's bad at communicating SO
[4:45:56] <+ggbhtg> Nah, I know how all people work 4Head
[4:45:58] <ralphfromdk> It's the best option when it's death or become zombie food..
[4:46:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot yeah when you cut the cable that thing falls for like, another 15 minutes
[4:46:01] <Goraka91> When zombies are overrunning your safehouse you set off the gas
[4:46:03] <@Menitta> Whaaaaaaat
[4:46:03] <Ashenik1> I mean how are you going to JUST TALK to your asassin like
[4:46:09] <%RadicalWeegee> Next gaaame??? Earth worm Jim
[4:46:09] <prince_johnny_> YEYEYEYE
[4:46:10] <%Irridium> oh think I accidentally sent the same message twice. ah well
[4:46:10] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> HALO 3 CONFIRMED PogChamp
[4:46:11] <Ultimatefool> Is it time for Woolie to watch Arby n' the Chief
[4:46:14] <Torivore> Earthworm Jim is Lekgolo
[4:46:24] <huskarl_zap> Do Elephants still exist?
[4:46:29] <voodoolawyer> His Space Suit is Forerunner Tech
[4:46:31] <+RaveBV> Get enemy to lower his weapon and then try to take him out before waiting for the CHANCE of him listening to reason.
[4:46:31] <Captain_sevatar> To be fair, arby did murder ALL of his acolytes before the just talk moment
[4:46:32] <%DensityD> Teemo?!?!?!
[4:46:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Ultimatefool oh man the montage of Chief making a montage of his kills with Linkin Park
[4:46:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:46:35] <+RaveBV> makes sense to me
[4:46:42] <Halospaz117> What's mass builder?
[4:46:43] <ChernoMuncho> at some point? i hope halo 3 is soon
[4:46:44] <thescrubking27> I hope they do ODST and reach at least
[4:46:44] <%SableS139a> That fucking tall? Jesus...
[4:46:48] <+ggbhtg> Bass Milder
[4:46:49] <Catpurrple> Someone else crashing the heretic talk would've fixed that moment, like Tartarus' phantom taking a potshot at the heretic leader, or some flood forms appearing.
[4:46:51] <voodoolawyer> Isn't that the Battle Royale?
[4:46:52] <brachydios777> Wha that?
[4:46:59] <TEEron11> please do reach and odst after 3
[4:47:01] <voodoolawyer> OH
[4:47:08] <%The_Timo> So good
[4:47:10] <TEEron11> they're unironically the best halo games
[4:47:12] <+RaveBV> I feel like Woolie should do ODST before Halo 3 just to get the timeline feel right
[4:47:16] <voodoolawyer> Sounds like Custom Robo but good
[4:47:16] <+Extraalex> Mass builder is out in early access on steam
[4:47:17] <Goraka91> The Covenant and Flood creatures are huge as fuck, we're just also a giant green superhuman so we don't notice
[4:47:22] <ChernoMuncho> yeah i really want to know how woolie would feel about reach
[4:47:36] <thescrubking27> Reach and ODST are the best actual games and you definitely need to play them
[4:47:36] <prime_name> Fair
[4:47:36] <%hattrick61> Big Spoils
[4:47:46] <KaitlynnHere> Uh oh
[4:47:46] <%DensityD> SERGEANT JOHNSON THO
[4:47:47] <brachydios777> COLE PROTOCOL
[4:47:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> BEAT YOU
[4:47:50] <%laserbeaming> MASS Builder must have had a big update recently, it's been showing up a lot in my Steam home page
[4:47:57] <%raven_frame> Unfortunate.
[4:48:02] <$QueequegTheater> It's LITERALLY glassing the entire planet
[4:48:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE WHOLE SURFACE
[4:48:06] <Goraka91> Turning the surface into literal glass
[4:48:07] <huskarl_zap> ITs just Extermanatus
[4:48:07] <gamewarden92> have more faith in the V
[4:48:11] <+ggbhtg> Salted
[4:48:11] <%Pyroclase> I think Halo started it, actually?
[4:48:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> EXTERMINATUS
[4:48:13] <BlackermanZX> [glass him]
[4:48:14] <Goraka91> I assume Halo
[4:48:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT'S SO SPITEFUL
[4:48:19] <Halospaz117> Did Halo start it?
[4:48:20] <Nevflinn> Halo is where I first heard of it
[4:48:20] <Spydurman> Halo
[4:48:22] <$QueequegTheater> @huskarl_zap Actually it's bigger than exterminatus
[4:48:22] <%Irridium> Halo's the fist I heard it
[4:48:22] <lotharrio> Mmm... wasn't it in Starcraft?
[4:48:24] <%jiggy_snipe> Bigby Kappa
[4:48:24] <%hattrick61> halo prob
[4:48:27] <huskarl_zap> Enders game or Starship troopers
[4:48:27] <%raven_frame> It was Halo for me for sure.
[4:48:27] <%emperordread> Star Shrek would be awesome
[4:48:27] <voodoolawyer> I thought I was buying Reach a drink!
[4:48:28] <drewslo> probably Warhammer
[4:48:28] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> wasn't glassing a term used for nuclear bombs
[4:48:28] <subjectg> Halo is the first I’ve heard it
[4:48:29] <+emeraldstreak> I first heard of it from Halo, but I dunno
[4:48:30] <$QueequegTheater> Exterminatus is just virus bombs
[4:48:31] <brachydios777> Exterminatus
[4:48:33] <%xeromage> I feel like it's left over from gulf war blowhards
[4:48:35] <ChernoMuncho> its like salting the soil or something
[4:48:38] <+ggbhtg> gotta cool cartoon intro
[4:48:41] <%DensityD> salt that motherfucking earth
[4:48:42] <Torivore> Started in Halo cause I like it most
[4:48:42] <IntrepidEye> Glassing is sometimes the entire planet but every now and then they just hit major cities and towns then leave
[4:48:42] <KaitlynnHere> To turn it into glass you have the hit the ground at it’s melting point, which would be pretty high
[4:48:43] <$QueequegTheater> Glassing is way more destructive
[4:48:50] <%BisoromiBear> [visible confusion]
[4:48:52] <Catpurrple> Glass is sand and other mineral whatevers that have gone molten. So, super heated plasma melting all the rock and sand, hey, you made some glass.
[4:48:55] <Captain_sevatar> We in the Imperium call that Exterminatus
[4:48:56] <Adamotron> There was an Earthworm Jim 3?
[4:48:56] <Goraka91> @QueequegTheater There's several types of Exterminatus but generally yeah
[4:48:57] <thescrubking27> @voodoolawyer holy shit my sides
[4:49:01] <voodoolawyer> Earthworm James
[4:49:08] <+MessyBristles> @woolieversus it comes from what nukes do to terrain
[4:49:12] <%Double_Tap_That> Probably has to do with how explosions of a high enough intensity (i.e. nukes) reach temperatures where they will turn the local silicate into glass.
[4:49:13] <zamzoph> Was that before or after Earthworm Jim 64?
[4:49:21] <IndoorSitup> Sang gelly
[4:49:22] <%laserbeaming> What's the fun in speculation if it's not wild?
[4:49:22] <%DensityD> Johnson isn't lucky, he's JUST THAT GOOD

[4:49:52] <%SableS139a> Thel's in his 60s?
[4:49:53] <%BisoromiBear> yeah, but cryo sleep
[4:49:53] <prime_name> Chief is that old?
[4:49:55] <lotharrio> The term "glassing" is from Halo, the concept is either from Lensman or Starship Troopers.
[4:49:56] <drewslo> nah Arby is hero, but that speculation is confirmed
[4:49:56] <+einherjarvalk> Miranda looks SUPER OLD in the remaster, she should be mid 30s tops
[4:49:56] <resloxxx> LUL
[4:49:57] <%Skyebaker> its not tho
[4:49:58] <Catpurrple> 67 makes sense for a guy with a long military career as an admiral or whatever
[4:49:59] <$Quiet__Viking> no the gravemind thing is true
[4:50:00] <$QueequegTheater> @SableS139a Elites live 200 years
[4:50:03] <Halospaz117> Actually isn't the proto gravemind a confirmed thing?
[4:50:03] <%Skyebaker> its true
[4:50:03] <Goraka91> I assume Elites live longer than humans
[4:50:04] <+Lizard0TM> That's all true tho
[4:50:09] <%SableS139a> @QueequegTheater tyroneW
[4:50:09] <black_pariah> thats not speculation at all
[4:50:10] <Captain_sevatar> yeah that shits canon
[4:50:10] <IndoorSitup> GUCK
[4:50:10] <brachydios777> Elites can get pretty old

[4:50:21] <Dean_Inbetween> No thats all true

[4:59:35] <voodoolawyer> there was also a guy who jumped into spartan armor and, since it's powered, he moved a little and it fucking broke most of his bones. he jerked in pain and it was also magnified. he accidentally wrenched himself to bits
[4:59:38] <%MacabreOpus> it truly bothers me that they're named Spartans but the armour is Mljonir.
[4:59:44] <%RadicalWeegee> Ittl get better!
[4:59:46] <IntrepidEye> He only tore an achilles tendon by going all out. the armor didn't break his fucking legs or had a limiter to turn off.
