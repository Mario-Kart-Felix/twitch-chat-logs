[0:10:37] <rusho> @floralkami You let an application or a console run for a set amount of time to determine if issues will arise. An example is vanilla Bloodborne, if soak tests were properly done, QA would have noted the memory leak that affects bosses after running for 4+ hours. That's my knowledge for a soak test at least.
