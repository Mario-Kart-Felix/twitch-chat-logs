[0:04:19] <%Shad0wTag> Remind me did Woolie and Reggie play Ataksuki Blitzkampf? Cuz I know they did on the main channel
[0:04:21] <i_DRiFT> war in the pocket
[0:04:23] <andre11dr> Ok but whens Super Fight tho?
[0:04:26] <haisho> Woolie has THE BARREL

[0:04:35] <%Shad0wTag> *old channel

[0:04:38] <Teradyne87> @RyTYoung Sorry to get your hopes up, just didn't want to be the only one hungry while they cook ^_^
[0:04:44] <%dds333a> @rasend0ri kusoge is a shit game, generally not good, poverty is just "low budget"
[0:04:48] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta Thank you, now I can go look for it
[0:04:53] <%FallenAngelZelos> If something is even tangentially related to fighting games, Woolie knows
[0:04:55] <%ekodrop> woolie always glancing over at reggie to make sure he's not making faces again
[0:05:04] <Bromosap1ens> How
[0:05:13] <%Shad0wTag> BOOST GANG BOOST GANG
[0:05:18] <%Irridium> booster johns
[0:05:24] <leith_aziz> @dds333a Kusoge can be loved games, but the term implies they're broken as f*ck. Marvel games are a good example of this
[0:05:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:05:27] <andre11dr> You can't keep running from Super Fight Woolie, You'll have to do it eventually, Reggie needs to know
[0:05:27] <%mr_sups> Boost Pain was not bad for me. But I know other's who got GOT by it.
[0:05:27] <Dragon_Batman> Heya, how's everyone doing?
[0:05:38] <Make_me_mad> I was gonna get my booster shot THE SAME DAY I came down with a fever and got actual Covid. That's some bullshit.
[0:05:43] <%mr_sups> Corona got BIGGER now.
[0:05:58] <%polothegreatest> KI conspiracy woolieMINHMAX

[0:06:04] <lem______> wait what are we doing today?
[0:06:06] <leith_aziz> I've been stuck home ever since today. I've been told things are getting scary outside
[0:06:17] <jorniev> my dad and i got got right at the start of the year. thankfully he is doing better
[0:06:18] <leith_aziz> pickySweat
[0:06:21] <%RyTYoung> @teradyne87 It’s all good it’s dinner time for me anyway, I will figure it out woolieDATTEBAYO

[0:06:40] <cartakus> Things are fine ish here but some people are getting lazy
[0:06:43] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz the actual term for kusoge refers to absolutely bad shit games, people call Marvel kusoge endearingly, besides Infinite
[0:06:44] <leith_aziz> Not anymore pickyShrug
[0:06:51] <%polothegreatest> Losing smell sucks woolieOMG
[0:06:55] <%Shad0wTag> ! BOOSTED !

[0:07:07] <+FuqBoiSlim> the body aches after the 2nd shot and the booster were beating my ass man. I stuck in bed all day
[0:07:11] <leith_aziz> @dds333a the word "Kusoge" stands for "shit"
[0:07:21] <cartakus> nice
[0:07:26] <iacus_> "shit game"
[0:07:30] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz yes, that's what I said LUL

[0:08:56] <%polothegreatest> Nice woolieGASM
[0:08:58] <andre11dr> I feel like "poverty" is more damming than Kusoge, Kusoge implies fun jank, Poverty is shit like that one Wu Tang game that doesn't work

[0:10:06] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL

[0:10:42] <+blastazoid00> Melty blood still lives in thew bathroom, in my heart

[1:05:14] <%Shad0wTag> @TheFramedWarlock Not at launch is all we know

[1:05:37] <$ArCielArDor> hmm
[1:05:44] <DSD24> I thought it was Atlus going "We are looking into Rollback' and thats it
[1:05:50] <leith_aziz> @TheFramedWarlock Rollback will be "considered" later down the line
[1:05:57] <@Menitta> They're "considering" it
[1:06:05] <Dragon_Batman> Aka if it makes enough money then maybe

[1:06:09] <%ekodrop> meaning it won't happen

[1:14:05] <DSD24> @Menitta Its such a cool part of Persona I love those cut ins
[1:14:26] <@Menitta> You could punish Maziodyne with an IK.
[1:14:37] <@Menitta> At least some of them
[1:15:17] <DSD24> Quick question you need your Persona to do a burst right? or can you still do it if your persona is broken?
[1:15:19] <%Shad0wTag> Especially MItsuru's as its full screen
[1:15:28] <@Menitta> You do need persona to burst yes

[1:23:43] <Vendigear> I'm not prepared koefMonkaW
[1:23:55] <Make_me_mad> Pretty much every DP works as a counter, Chie's is definitely one of the most demanding.
[1:24:06] <Make_me_mad> Kanji's has an INSANE duration.
[1:24:24] <+marquezpsp> it's a good thing the Persona series doesn't have any Nazis in it
[1:24:31] <@Menitta> Part of me wishes Ultimax had a USF4 version select to play the original characters
[1:24:44] <@Menitta> But thats a lot lol
[1:25:13] <+Maleicus> isnt that what the shadows are for
[1:25:26] <Make_me_mad> Shadows have the old autocombos but it's not quite the same.
[1:25:34] <arkv01> LUL
[1:25:47] <@Menitta> Sort of. They have the same auto combo which changes a lot but they're a lot different on a system level
[1:25:48] <Make_me_mad> The 2.5 patch at least gave them a burst so it's more like a normal character.
[1:25:48] <Vendigear> its what the shadows should've been, instead of having their own system
[1:25:55] <DSD24> Shadows have a different awakening mechanic right?
[1:25:58] <@Menitta> Oh they have Burst in 2.5?!
[1:25:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> tossed Kappa
[1:26:08] <@Menitta> That's scary
[1:26:11] <Make_me_mad> 2.5 gives shadows a burst, and your shadow frenzy uses burst.
[1:26:23] <Make_me_mad> When you shadow frenzy the opponent can't burst for the duration.
[1:26:28] <Vendigear> he's learning rooPog
[1:26:31] <@Menitta> Jeeeez
[1:26:40] <Make_me_mad> It's nuts. Excited to finally get to touch it when the steam version hits.
[1:26:47] <@Menitta> For sure
[1:27:01] <@Menitta> I'm debating trying Shadow Mitsuru
[1:27:03] <Make_me_mad> To compensate they dropped some of the damage and bonus health shadows get, I think.
[1:27:05] <leith_aziz> If you play against Shadow characters, watch out for Shadow Chie and Shadow Naoto pickyStare
[1:27:12] <%mr_sups> CAUGHT
[1:27:18] <Vendigear> and Shadow Mitsuru
[1:27:19] <Make_me_mad> Also Shadows don't awaken, they always have access to the awakening supers.
[1:27:41] <$ArCielArDor> wait didn't she have an air grab?
[1:28:14] <+AngelYoumou> I forgot how disgustingly hard Chie's dragon kick hits

[1:42:26] <leith_aziz> doodOK
[1:42:30] <Aussie_Manny> Akihiko with this colour looks like a Guilty Gear character.
[1:42:43] <%dds333a> Akihiko is the best character in P3, and it's not even a competition LUL
[1:42:48] <leith_aziz> He looks more like a Fist Of the North Star character personally

[1:43:41] <leith_aziz> Ggs
[1:43:50] <%Heefnoff> So I kept spending Gold burst after my own air throw because I was trying to extend a combo
[1:43:55] <%Heefnoff> Completely forgot how to do it
[1:43:56] <+rasend0ri> He’s gonna go juice up
[1:43:57] <Joestar1890> Apparently he's protein crazed in the original japanese version of Persona 3, and the Western version toned it down.
[1:44:15] <@Menitta> oh man I hope we hear Margaret's theme

[1:44:45] <DSD24> I remember him being all Protein man in Persona Q
[1:44:53] <+yeknomlive> who's harder to play marge or aigis

[1:45:05] <+pectusumbra> @DSD24 everyone is dumber in persona q

[1:45:10] <Vendigear> Aigis
[1:45:11] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie, remember the basics of AkihikoQC.
[1:45:15] <%Shad0wTag> @yeknomlive Aigis
[1:45:22] <+yeknomlive> i tried learning aigs back in the day but i was too new to wrap around orgia mode
[1:45:26] <%dds333a> Aigis  is all technical execution
[1:45:36] <cartakus> orgia mode?
[1:45:48] <+yeknomlive> that's her install so she gets megido flame
[1:45:48] <leith_aziz> Persona spin-offs have a problem with flanderising the cast. That's what makes Persona 5 Strikers special
[1:45:52] <OkamiDude15> @DSD24 pq leans harder into the quirky aspects of them then the regular games
[1:45:55] <Aussie_Manny> that doesn't look true
[1:46:05] <%Shad0wTag> @leith_aziz Agreed because it feels less like a spin off unliek Strikes
[1:46:09] <%Shad0wTag> *unlike

[1:55:54] <%RyTYoung> @shad0wtag that might be a good pick then ty!
[1:55:54] <leith_aziz> pickyVibing pickyVibing pickyVibing
[1:56:02] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Persona games take double the time to finish because I always listen to the songs until repeat
[1:56:09] <%Shad0wTag> @InvisiblessedReptile He also plays a lot like Ky in GG
[1:56:21] <%RyTYoung> @leith_aziz I would but I haven’t got much idea on what characters have what inputs
[1:56:29] <%livlinn> LUL
[1:56:35] <+AngelYoumou> Mitsuru is also really Simple....she has what, 3 moves?
[1:56:37] <Aussie_Manny> I like seeing different characters being played by the chat.
[1:56:43] <@Menitta> Mitsuru is a charge character
[1:56:47] <+AngelYoumou> True
[1:56:56] <@Menitta> She's got some weird stuff thats rather situational
[1:57:06] <Aussie_Manny> That's some grizzly damage
[1:57:07] <+AngelYoumou> Hm, fair.
[1:57:14] <%RyTYoung> I’ll go with my gut when the time comes, thanks dudes doodGood
[1:57:16] <Aussie_Manny> tiffosHeadbang Buuuuurn myyyyy dreeeeeaaaaad!
[1:57:19] <@Menitta> Like in general, if you land a standing hit, the best thing you can do is just autocombo
[1:57:19] <%Shad0wTag> She's also kinda technical because of charge partioning if you ever go that hard
[1:57:20] <leith_aziz> pickyVibing
[1:57:28] <PKSomething> cant wait for reggie to get hit by teddie circus, he wont be ready
[1:57:33] <leith_aziz> @RyTYoung No problem pickyEZ
[1:57:35] <Vendigear> foxyjoParty foxyjoParty foxyjoParty
[1:57:37] <@Menitta> Charge Partitioning is hard for me but I manage lol
[1:57:49] <Aussie_Manny> This is making me hype for the March PC re-release.
[1:58:14] <leith_aziz> When and if it gets rollback, I'll be hyped to try it out pickyEZ
[1:58:20] <Aussie_Manny> freaking projectiles
[1:58:21] <+AngelYoumou> Like Margaret. She gets WRECKED by losing her Persona
[1:58:34] <+FuqBoiSlim> I just glad this game left the 7th gen dungeon
[1:58:36] <PKSomething> yeah I'm not buying this game till it gets rollback, even if its an all time fave
[1:58:37] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @leith_aziz Yeah, I'm holding my breath for this
[1:58:39] <%dds333a> Rage MonkaS
[1:58:52] <Aussie_Manny> Reggie and the schmix!

[2:00:08] <+InvisiblessedReptile> are the story modes in P4A and Ultimax any different?
[2:00:18] <%dds333a> Way different
[2:00:31] <Aussie_Manny> Teddie's bringing it back!
[2:00:36] <%dds333a> Ultimax is the sequel
[2:00:39] <%Shad0wTag> @InvisiblessedReptile Yup Ultimax is a sequel and continues on from it and has a P3 and P4 routes
[2:00:40] <%cubbywolf> lol

[2:01:27] <%dds333a> @angelyoumou Weather girl LUL
[2:01:31] <zepelinnn1> @Menitta as a DLC, no?
[2:01:45] <TheeRabbi> SH2  way more colorful than I remembered
[2:01:50] <leith_aziz> @Menitta It's all in teh package. Not a DLC
[2:01:59] <@Menitta> I dont think so. If it is though, the port would still have it
[2:02:06] <%Irridium> It was a dlc originally
[2:02:09] <+AngelYoumou> Too bad this isn't the version that fixed Rise

[2:05:39] <%dds333a> carries
[2:05:41] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Guys, check the price on steam, apparently there's a bundle (at least here in Brazil) with both P4AU and Golden... and Golden is free with it, the discount covers it
[2:05:45] <Joestar1890> Is this an open match sort of thing?
[2:05:46] <+yeknomlive> he charge moves are only on her ice ones right?
[2:05:49] <mothdude> da boot
[2:05:51] <cartakus> Jesus this woman

[2:06:06] <+yeknomlive> oh ok
[2:06:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:06:15] <T_Sasquatch> Im confused i thought this game was only on ps3 ,xbox.  How are they using parsec
[2:06:18] <tolloponik> Das BOOT
[2:06:18] <+leviting> the range on that sword seems significant
[2:06:25] <PKSomething> @T_Sasquatch emulation
[2:06:34] <PKSomething> @T_Sasquatch ps3 emulation specifically
[2:06:48] <%Irridium> YEE
[2:06:52] <%dds333a> Mitsuru players only know myriad arrows Kappa
[2:06:55] <T_Sasquatch> @pksomething i didn't realize ps3 emulation was this good already
[2:07:00] <+AngelYoumou> Yeah!
[2:07:02] <DSD24> I know Artemisia is really cool, but I was always a fan of Penthesilea her first Persona
[2:07:06] <PKSomething> @T_Sasquatch yeah its come a long way fast
[2:07:14] <tolloponik> @PKSomething wait the PC version didn't release yet?
[2:07:16] <%dds333a> @dsd24 agreed
[2:07:22] <+AngelYoumou> March
[2:07:25] <PKSomething> @tolloponik nope, this is emulation and parsec
[2:07:26] <%ekodrop> @tolloponik emu
[2:07:31] <%Shad0wTag> @T_Sasquatch Ultimax isn't super demanding so this is pretty okay to emulate
[2:07:47] <DSD24> @dds333a Penth had really cool blue colors and looked super classy
[2:07:58] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @T_Sasquatch You need a pretty good PC, though. Especially for full 3D games. Most 2D games run no problem on weaker machines. Like, on a 1050, Drakengard 3 is a no, Arcana Hearts is a no, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is a yes!
[2:08:29] <%Shad0wTag> NO FUCKING WAY
[2:08:34] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:08:36] <%Rasheedt> lmao
[2:08:37] <+FuqBoiSlim> ah gottem ggs

[2:09:05] <cartakus> damn
[2:09:17] <+deathygz> fucking lol
[2:09:20] <T_Sasquatch> Seriously sony just doesn't care. They'd make so much money if psnow had emulated ps3 games. Instead of bs excuses
[2:09:33] <%dds333a> the approach LUL
[2:09:44] <%Shad0wTag> YOU GOT IT MENITTA
[2:09:51] <DSD24> Please don't do it Mitsuru
[2:09:58] <+InvisiblessedReptile> @T_Sasquatch It's that thing, they currently lead the market, they don't need to go this extra mile. It's a shame, really
[2:10:09] <Joestar1890> Okay, but Mitsuru tho
[2:10:36] <%Shad0wTag> THATS ANOTHER FOR THE CHAT
[2:10:55] <cartakus> Gotta take one from woolie
[2:11:00] <%Heefnoff> Woooo chat

[2:11:11] <+AngelYoumou> Okay, but who's gonna slide in here with the Elizabeth nonsense?

[2:11:18] <Aussie_Manny> in your head?
[2:11:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> The booster curse kicking in?

[2:12:00] <%dds333a> Minazuki
[2:12:02] <@Menitta> Did I win the first match?
[2:12:12] <%ekodrop> i didn't think so, but maybe?
[2:12:14] <%livlinn> I mean, despite of that Woolie looking incredibly well?
[2:12:15] <@Menitta> Chie's D persona is really good in the air
[2:12:18] <DSD24> Is Minazuki edgy
[2:12:24] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Can't wait for my booster to finally give me *bamf* teleport or maybe ice powers
[2:12:25] <Joestar1890> I'd say so

[2:39:40] <Make_me_mad> Labry's voice is the best.
[2:39:47] <%dds333a> CHIE PLAYERS
[2:39:48] <Jaysky> The thumbnail for me right now is someone scoping in on Chie with a sniper
[2:39:52] <GenericSoda> Labrys is supposed to be speaking Kansai-ben, right?
[2:39:56] <%dds333a> They only know one button
[2:39:58] <PKSomething> Yep
[2:39:59] <%elderpunch> GOTTEM

[2:40:02] <+AngelYoumou> @GenericSoda Yep yep
[2:40:06] <PKSomething> which is brooklyn accent in english
[2:40:17] <PKSomething> I think
[2:40:17] <GenericSoda> @PKSomething it's whatever the localizer at the time chooses
[2:40:22] <leith_aziz> Allthough, Sol's Jump K makes me a hypocrite
[2:40:26] <GenericSoda> Kansai is more rural iirc
[2:40:27] <Aussie_Manny> WHOA

[2:40:45] <@Menitta> BING BONG
[2:40:48] <tolloponik> I must go My planet Needs me
[2:40:51] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus Reggie needs to pay attention to the axe gauge
[2:40:56] <%elderpunch> anyone play a yukari or rise yet?
[2:41:03] <@Menitta> I hope we see a Rise
[2:41:17] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag I bet he literally doesn't know what that means
[2:41:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1480792413480312832?s=20
[2:41:20] <PKSomething> I never even knew Labyrs had this axe mechanic...
[2:41:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> Man we haven't seen either of them last stream even
[2:41:25] <blackkanye> holy fuck that damage
[2:41:26] <+yeknomlive> holy dam
[2:41:35] <%The_Death_Owl> Heavenly damage
[2:41:39] <%Shad0wTag> @elderpunch Nope, just me as  Sho, Menitta as Mitsuru, A Narukami and a Shadow Teddie so far
[2:41:40] <%elderpunch> @fuqboislim ye
[2:41:46] <%elderpunch> rise is fun as hell tho
[2:41:46] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a you were saying
[2:41:47] <@Menitta> Its like Hisako in KI where when the axe is red, it acts as counter hits
[2:41:52] <AverageHanzo> love Labrys' design with the visor
[2:41:58] <%elderpunch> she legit has a rhytm game special
[2:41:59] <@Menitta> some of the hits do at least
[2:41:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> My Rise is rusty as fuuuck
[2:42:01] <cartakus> big damage incoming?
[2:42:03] <%Shad0wTag> THERE GOES THE HEALTH
[2:42:03] <+FuqBoiSlim> GYAT DAMN
[2:42:08] <+AngelYoumou> Red Axe=God help you if she lands ANYTHING
[2:42:10] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag yeah, does not seem like he did LUL
[2:42:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> My main is Akihiko, Sub Shabrys
[2:42:32] <%The_Death_Owl> this block string woolieT
[2:42:33] <+gpallas> Chie seens like she should have Genei Jin xD
[2:42:41] <%elderpunch> the cross
[2:42:47] <GenericSoda> @gpallas she has Power Charge
[2:43:01] <%elderpunch> OHH
[2:43:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I wanna see a fuckin Yosuke, those guys are cracked
[2:43:14] <Make_me_mad> I love playing a good Yosuke player.
[2:43:15] <blackkanye> Yosuke even remans cracked in bbtag. Fucking scary
[2:43:15] <+gpallas> @GenericSoda How does that work?
[2:43:15] <%elderpunch> @alteisenreisez im not there yet unfortunately
[2:43:24] <Make_me_mad> Main Kanji, Sub Labrys, Sub-sub Liz btw.
[2:43:25] <%ekodrop> irridium really wants that ik...
[2:43:26] <GenericSoda> @gpallas it makes her deal a shitton of extra damage
[2:43:29] <%elderpunch> but there are amazng yosuke players in the discord
[2:43:40] <%elderpunch> i might hop on and lab tn
[2:43:50] <Hammatime8> Labrys: Robot with a big axe. Chie K I C K
[2:43:51] <%dds333a> @gpallas she does massive damage, and God's Hand does even more obscene damage
[2:44:03] <+gpallas> Makoto's SA3 without the drawback?
[2:44:03] <%dds333a> it just spends the Charge
[2:44:06] <GenericSoda> also high level Yosuke play is WILD. People just gliding all over and twerking on you with ambiguous left/right high/low mixes
[2:44:07] <@Menitta> oooooh
[2:44:17] <%elderpunch> @genericsoda on god
[2:44:18] <%Shad0wTag> YOOOOOOO
[2:44:21] <%Irridium> gg's
[2:44:28] <%Shad0wTag> Nice job @Irridium!
[2:44:30] <%Irridium> that's what happens when I'm not fishing for an insta kill LUL
[2:44:43] <%dds333a> Reggie at least knows Chie's system (kinda) LUL
[2:44:46] <blackkanye> oh my arm fell off FUNgineer
[2:45:09] <PKSomething> YOSUKE MY BOY
[2:45:10] <Aussie_Manny> Yosuke?!
[2:45:16] <3Xgilly> catJAM
[2:45:18] <PKSomething> OH
[2:45:20] <%elderpunch> wow
[2:45:22] <%dds333a> Canon matchup, Chie beats up on Yosuke all the time
[2:45:22] <PKSomething> :c
[2:45:27] <GenericSoda> pour one out for Yosuke glide, removed in 2.0
[2:45:31] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, thought it was a match. lol
[2:45:37] <%Heefnoff> But can you do it on block
[2:45:38] <tolloponik> first yosuke of the night and its as a dummy
[2:46:00] <PKSomething> yosuke is so slick in this game but he requires way too much tech input for me to play properly
[2:46:41] <%Irridium> majinoNeko majinoNeko majinoNeko
[2:46:42] <tolloponik> every yosuke player I met says they are in constant agony
[2:46:43] <GenericSoda> I could do glides consistently but Xrd dropped before I could really sink my teeth into doing the really technical stuff
[2:46:44] <Ardisan_> fuck yosuke
[2:46:48] <%Heefnoff> Two jump C into Dragon Kick?
[2:46:50] <Make_me_mad> Proudest moment v. Yosuke was pulling off Kanji's command grab with my controls reversed and grabbing him out of his super-speed dash.
[2:46:51] <%Shad0wTag> @tolloponik Just watch, I bet you now summoned a buncha Yosuke mains from the discord
[2:46:52] <Ardisan_> jubei everyday
[2:47:07] <GenericSoda> Yosuke also has a quirk of having the only air move that can hit overhead if done from hop
[2:47:24] <Jaysky> Bruddah I'm telling you Yosukes had it too good for too long
[2:47:35] <%Heefnoff> Not bad damage
[2:47:45] <%dds333a> Don't be far Kappa
[2:48:00] <+pupil31> 2B Kreygasm
[2:48:08] <%dds333a> Chie has unfortunately little ranged options woolieF

[2:50:02] <+gpallas> Is this Reggie's first contact with P4A?
[2:50:34] <%Lion_kun> Also Hitler is in it.
[2:50:35] <zhenthrim213> yea
[2:50:38] <RyuuAoi> No I heard it....AND I WANT IT STILL. MAKE IT A PODCAST, COWARDS
[2:50:40] <+kewlmyc> Raidou 1 > Persona 2 confirmed
[2:50:40] <+pupil31> LUL
[2:50:42] <%polothegreatest> p2
[2:50:42] <%dds333a> Game is great
[2:50:44] <RyuuAoi> GREAT STORY. LIAR
[2:50:45] <tolloponik> then do P1
[2:50:48] <meatgeneral69> Persona 2 is a terrible LP game
[2:50:48] <%polothegreatest> WutFace
[2:50:51] <BlackermanZX> game is great but holy shit it takes a while
[2:50:56] <Tracazoid> That and you have to deal with the fact that the second game in Persona 2 doesn't have a good translation, since they cancelled the PSP version
[2:50:56] <%elderpunch> hes right
[2:50:57] <@Menitta> That makes sense
[2:51:01] <%Lion_kun> Also Hitler is not very LP friendly.
[2:51:02] <RyuuAoi> Hard grind though. You're right
[2:51:04] <Dragon_Batman> That makes alot of sense
[2:51:04] <+yeknomlive> p1 has so many encounters tho
[2:51:08] <%ekodrop> ...someone's a bit strung rn
[2:51:12] <%Lion_kun> Rasputin is more PC than Hitler.
[2:51:16] <%polothegreatest> p3 need a guide, no room for funsies
[2:51:16] <%Shad0wTag> Its completely valid Woolz
[2:51:17] <%dds333a> Raidou doesn't even need grinding too LUL
[2:51:18] <+james_cest_drole> What about PQ? KappaHD
[2:51:20] <+AngelYoumou> You would also only have half the story
[2:51:25] <Qu1ckyyy> You could grind Raidou offscreen in that dungeon
[2:51:25] <Joestar1890> Guessin P3 is the same?
[2:51:26] <RyuuAoi> Stuck on P2 Eternal Punishment rn and I'm dying.
[2:51:30] <Qu1ckyyy> P2 is harder
[2:51:34] <BlackermanZX> honestly P3 to P5 are better lp choices
[2:51:34] <RyuuAoi> LP Tax
[2:51:34] <@Menitta> Oh yeah I forgot Chie has unique dialogue for her auto combo with Yosuke
[2:51:35] <Ardisan_> P2 best persona
[2:51:39] <%dds333a> @polothegreatest P3 doesn't require a guide
[2:51:42] <RyuuAoi> I feel you, Woolie.
[2:51:50] <+dujam> man when i played p2 absolutely nothing clicked for me and i wasnt into it at all. feels like i missed something
[2:51:51] <%elderpunch> p3 is even worse for LP purposes surprisingly
[2:51:52] <+AngelYoumou> It's also very easy to screw yourself over in P2
[2:51:57] <%elderpunch> A LOT of padding
[2:52:00] <Tracazoid> It's my favourite, Eternal Punishment PS1 tho
[2:52:08] <%ekodrop> imagine them playing revelations the demon slayer...
[2:52:16] <%polothegreatest> you need it if want max bond DarkMode
[2:52:17] <RyuuAoi> Hour of suffer.
[2:52:20] <Dragon_Batman> Just because it's great doesn't make it a good lp, basically right?
[2:52:21] <+gpallas> Go back all the way to Megami Tensei :p
[2:52:23] <@Menitta> its a PS1 RPG. Thats kinda typical
[2:52:26] <RyuuAoi> P1 is unique doe.
[2:52:28] <leith_aziz> I heard something about JoJo?
[2:52:28] <GiantDad2003> And I would still watch it.
[2:52:35] <+yeknomlive> it would be rough for streaming
[2:52:36] <Aussie_Manny> hop hop hop hop
[2:52:37] <%elderpunch> smt nocturne when tho omniVegeta
[2:52:39] <+Joe2187> Yall need to get on that real persona competative game....Catherine versus
[2:52:40] <tolloponik> then P zero Kappa
[2:52:46] <+chrispunchesboulder> chrispunchesboulder subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[2:53:21] <@Menitta> woolieSHOOK
[2:53:22] <+james_cest_drole> Any interest in some of the better Tales Of games? symphonia has some pretty great action combat.
[2:53:23] <+Joe2187> When's CATHERINE Vs Mode
[2:53:23] <tolloponik> isn't there a p2 ds remake or am I misremembering that
[2:53:26] <@Menitta> Naoto Time
[2:53:31] <+FuqBoiSlim> hey I left for a minute we doing combo challenges now?
[2:53:32] <+AngelYoumou> PSP, not DS
[2:53:49] <cartakus> When is get into for honor?
[2:54:01] <%Irridium> yeah literally just steal that's what I do fuck it LUL
[2:54:03] <%Shad0wTag> @tolloponik There was PSP remakes for P2 IS and EP but the gameplay is more or less the same its a stilla 1st person dungeon crawler
[2:54:03] <%dds333a> @ryuuaoi the game is overall kinda easy, but yeah LUL
[2:54:03] <+erictables> bruh twitter tags are a LIFESAVER
[2:54:06] <tolloponik> I just wish to know when to press the next button
[2:54:12] <yukichocomilk> STEAL EVERYTHING
[2:54:18] <%Shad0wTag> Your combo? My Combo
[2:54:18] <leith_aziz> Why would that count as stealing? Come on
[2:54:24] <%Irridium> oh man I used to go hard on For Honor
[2:54:25] <@Menitta> I wanna go back to For Honor
[2:54:27] <Aussie_Manny> For honor? hoooooo
[2:54:28] <Dragon_Batman> I'm shure you were going to
[2:54:29] <tolloponik> @Shad0wTag ok so I'm not insane
[2:54:29] <+FuqBoiSlim> yo?
[2:54:29] <leith_aziz> Oh, dope
[2:54:41] <Hammatime8> Oh dang
[2:54:41] <%Heefnoff> Oh, have you looked at any of the UMVC3 mods that have come out? They're basically full new characters, and there's a TON at this point
[2:54:45] <Dragon_Batman> For Honor was so fun at the time
[2:54:48] <+Joe2187> When is getting into CATHERINE VS?
[2:54:51] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag P2 isnt first person
[2:54:52] <Aussie_Manny> Damn pandemic
[2:54:57] <cartakus> One of the weirdest fighting games there is
[2:54:59] <%livlinn> joofbCry
[2:55:03] <+erictables> I remember when VF5FS first came out, the OPOVERTY to find resources to learn with lol. People was dedicated to make those resources in the first place
[2:55:03] <%Irridium> I dropped off that one patch that made changes based off scripts and fucked my main (Aramusha)
[2:55:05] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a My B I'm thinking of P1
[2:55:15] <@Menitta> For Honor is super cool. Its a shame it kinda fell off
[2:55:18] <RyuuAoi> @dds333a I can feel I'm at the end of Eternal Punishment. Went into this battle with the wrong Persona. Need fire. Hard grind ahead.
[2:55:29] <%chrispunchesboulder> Have either of you guys played Chivalry?
[2:55:36] <lem______> MOAR TEDDIES
[2:55:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:56:18] <%townzzzzz> my eyes
[2:56:22] <+AngelYoumou> Oh hey, Eyestrain Chie
[2:56:24] <Aussie_Manny> They're coloured like a packet of Wonka Nerds.
[2:56:30] <+StooEsq> I need earmuffs to look at some of these colors
[2:56:31] <%dds333a> some were... experimental
[2:56:41] <Ardisan_> What human would enjoy these colors
[2:56:46] <Dragon_Batman> Eyemuffs needed for shure lol
[2:56:46] <+yeknomlive> is rpcs3 the best emulator?
[2:56:48] <%livlinn> BisexualPride LesbianPride
[2:56:54] <%SaurianCrash> palette colors for seeing all the places you can color
[2:56:58] <leith_aziz> Blue and Purple are some of my favorite colors. But this blend of them doesnt look as nice as I'd want them
[2:57:01] <haisho> ah yes the countless versions of Goku
[2:57:01] <@Menitta> Mitsuru's 6D whiffs against Teddie
[2:57:05] <%Shad0wTag> @yeknomlive Its been around the longest
[2:57:07] <@Menitta> its infuriating LUL
[2:57:17] <%Heefnoff> High low MIX
[2:57:28] <leith_aziz> Even MVC?
[2:57:30] <lem______> is it?
[2:57:38] <%Heefnoff> MVC's isn't complicated calc wise
[2:57:43] <%averyoddjew> averyoddjew subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! hell yeah
[2:57:44] <+gpallas> All this Bs and Cs made me want them to play MotW xD
[2:57:44] <%Heefnoff> Like, compared to this
[2:57:53] <lem______> cause is similar to BB isnt it?
[2:57:55] <leith_aziz> Wait, you mean damage or chance of combos dropping?
[2:58:01] <%Irridium> labrys red axe = big damage is all I know
[2:58:03] <+gpallas> Have they made an episode on it?
[2:58:16] <GenericSoda> yeah supers in this game have really high minimum damage
[2:58:16] <%Heefnoff> Man that barrel is so cheap lol
[2:58:21] <%Irridium> plus there's counters and fatal counters
[2:58:31] <lem______> didnt SMP loops get killed?
[2:58:33] <%Heefnoff> It's a DP iirc
[2:58:34] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm
[2:58:35] <lem______> its def unblockable
[2:58:38] <GenericSoda> I know Naoto's Same Move Proration loops got removed for Ultimax
[2:58:41] <%Shad0wTag> That looked pretty funny
[2:58:50] <cartakus> Reggie vs god hand just came into my mind for some reason
[2:58:50] <lem______> he can choose left right
[2:58:53] <lem______> or both with ex
[2:58:55] <Make_me_mad> Teddie Circus MF.
[2:58:55] <%dds333a> @lem______ they did
[2:58:57] <%Heefnoff> Yeah can confirm Naoto loops were heavily nerfed
[2:59:07] <%Heefnoff> But, they buffed how Fate counter works so it's fair
[2:59:08] <GenericSoda> I think it's left and right three times?
[2:59:09] <lem______> @dds333a thanks boss
[2:59:09] <%Heefnoff> Kappa
[2:59:27] <GenericSoda> I know for a fact that freeze is remedied by three button presses in 2.0 and on though
[2:59:38] <lem______> naoto got the best buff of all, a shadow character
[3:00:09] <RyuuAoi> Reggie getting wrecked by the CP? LUL
[3:00:28] <cartakus> lol
[3:00:45] <Aussie_Manny> 60%?!
[3:00:47] <lem______> tthat just sounds like arcsys
[3:00:56] <Dragon_Batman> So there is scaling and character buffs? LUL
[3:01:04] <GenericSoda> and then there's the defense buff with Awakening too LUL
[3:01:05] <leith_aziz> Ok, so we're talking combo scaling alone
[3:01:10] <yukichocomilk> NotLikeThis
[3:01:12] <Dragon_Batman> No wonder they don't wanna make Arena again
[3:01:17] <RyuuAoi> Science in dis bitch
[3:01:19] <+itsgundamu> bro i'm just pressing buttons
[3:01:20] <+gpallas> I thought "combo rating" was gonna be something like a hidden style meter that made the combo scale less the more stylish it was xD
[3:01:22] <blackkanye> too many numbers. me press button and do combo
[3:01:23] <cartakus> The fuck is this math shit?
[3:01:28] <leith_aziz> Im fine with Guts personally cohhNotes
[3:01:31] <haisho> are we gonna need NASA again?
[3:01:42] <GenericSoda> @gpallas that would be a sick mechanic for a hypothetical DMC fighter
[3:01:45] <+pupil31> lirikHMM
[3:01:57] <tolloponik> when you add numbers to a fighting game you Immediately lose me, as soon as you start talking about frame data You LOSE ME
[3:02:01] <%Irridium> what

[3:02:03] <%Irridium> that wasn't me
[3:02:03] <cartakus> GGs
[3:02:05] <marcomatame> man i really hope the rerelease of this game has a dash macro. double-tapping forward to dash is just unfun for me.
[3:02:06] <Qu1ckyyy> I press button I do damage, simple
[3:02:07] <lem______> beena  while since ive done this
[3:02:08] <nachotree> My brain is shrinking in real time
[3:02:11] <%Irridium> LUL
[3:02:25] <leith_aziz> Like Guts can be complicated in GG, but im fine with it because it works well as a comeback mechanic
[3:02:29] <blackkanye> I mash. I do combo. Simple as
[3:02:37] <%dds333a> @tolloponik these games are made with numbers LUL

[3:24:01] <%Shad0wTag> @AngelYoumou This MU makes it hype
[3:24:03] <%elderpunch> WOOO
[3:24:20] <@Menitta> Are the IK moves only possible on awakened?
[3:24:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:24:31] <@Menitta> And is that why Shadow Naoto so good?

[3:25:42] <blackkanye> Man I haven't played for so long and I was even more booty back then
[3:25:46] <@Menitta> Shadow characters dont have the regular IK but Naoto's entire subsystem is based on unique IK moves
[3:25:49] <gazdropish2> so is it just grab - activate - super - wrong guess on wakeup - ik?
[3:25:59] <%dds333a> @gpallas it's a process

[3:35:49] <+StooEsq> got flashbacks to that Vanilla Ice fight from Capcom JoJo's from that Teddy super
[3:35:53] <%ekodrop> that's 1-1
[3:35:55] <cartakus> One more!
[3:36:01] <%The_Death_Owl> The beast in heat is gonna be unbearable next round
[3:36:03] <Make_me_mad> That's 1-1 Woolie, stop pretending you're that good.
[3:36:04] <marcomatame> @AngelYoumou absolutely, mf activated my violent intent whenever he spoke, english still annoying but far less than jp. him and rise are the only ones i prefer in english though.
[3:36:05] <%dds333a> @stooesq holes in the screen LUL
[3:36:06] <%Heefnoff> They really should make both players opt in to rematch
[3:36:11] <%Heefnoff> Weird that this game doesn’t do that
[3:36:13] <Aussie_Manny> @Make_me_mad lmao
[3:36:28] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff I guess its the game showing its age in a way
[3:36:31] <+FuqBoiSlim> @make_me_mad damn lmfao
[3:36:36] <%The_Death_Owl> if only there was a PS2 Chie voice pack
[3:36:44] <%Heefnoff> I mean, even SFIV and UMVC3 had that @shad0wtag
[3:36:59] <%Heefnoff> I suspect fighting games just have so many small important bits that it’s easy to forget small stuff like that
[3:37:01] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag yeah, despite games before then having it
[3:37:01] <agsiar2> is woolie always picking arihiko or does he play chie too?
[3:37:03] <cartakus> SLAP
[3:37:08] <%SirGO0SE> GOT EM
[3:37:09] <marcomatame> @The_Death_Owl they changed Chie's VA in Golden?
[3:37:11] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:37:13] <@Menitta> that super is too long for the damage it does
[3:37:14] <BlackermanZX> gottem
[3:37:15] <%Irridium> @Heefnoff is it only capcom that does this? Feels likeit.
[3:37:16] <+pupil31> TEDDIE BOI
[3:37:17] <%dds333a> @agsiar2 Aki is his main
[3:37:18] <%Heefnoff> No Reggie is the Chie @agsiar2
[3:37:22] <%derpumpkinking> ROLLIN BITCH
[3:37:28] <TigerClaws12> teddy got hands
[3:37:30] <%Heefnoff> Nah ArcSys does it now too @irridium
[3:37:32] <agsiar2> i see, thx
[3:37:32] <AverageHanzo> so the ball is unblockable and you have to jump it?
[3:37:32] <PKSomething> in the P4 anime they changed it to Erin Fitgerald and she reprised it for golden and p4a
[3:37:33] <%Shad0wTag> @The_Death_Owl They changed on the anime and then in Golded and everything else going forward
[3:37:38] <%The_Death_Owl> @marcomatame  yes it was very different, much more calm
[3:37:40] <%Shad0wTag> Her new VA is Erin Fitzgerald
[3:37:43] <cartakus> god his voice is just the worst
[3:37:58] <agsiar2> erin fitzgerald is imo a better match
[3:38:00] <PKSomething> Same with Teddie, changed to Sam Riegal
[3:38:06] <%The_Death_Owl> I don't hat new Chie but in a fighting game with repeated lines she's kinda grating
[3:38:07] <@Menitta> @marcomatame yes. After P4, Erin Fitzgerald took over for Chie. Teddie's voice also changed
[3:38:11] <%Shad0wTag> @agsiar2 I agree but we in the minority
[3:38:14] <cartakus> final round
[3:38:21] <@Menitta> I personally prefer Erin Fitzgerald
[3:38:26] <%dds333a> Old chie was leagues better, not even a contest LUL
[3:38:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1480792413480312832?s=20
[3:38:30] <Aussie_Manny> Teddie's voicelines are a part of his kit, to psych you out. HahaThink
[3:38:31] <Ryful_z3> that is a digusting teddie color
[3:38:35] <PKSomething> Nah people came around to Erins voice
[3:38:36] <agsiar2> also, erin fitzgerald voices parasoul
[3:38:38] <marcomatame> @The_Death_Owl maybe someone will make a mod for that on the PC version eventually-
[3:38:39] <%dds333a> @aussie_manny LUL
[3:38:44] <heartlesshealer> both the chie VA's are good, but I can understand loving the first voice you heard

[3:39:48] <%Shad0wTag> Shad0wTag gifted a Tier 1 sub to lem______! They have given 15 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[3:39:50] <%dds333a> forgot, he says Kappa
[3:39:51] <PKSomething> just teddie circus, it works everytime
[3:39:54] <%Heefnoff> The booster messed me up pretty bad when I got it
[3:39:56] <BlackermanZX> booster is hitting huh
[3:39:56] <%Shad0wTag> You get that for the sick play
[3:39:57] <%lem______> @Shad0wTag Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:39:58] <heartlesshealer> @dds333a idk, teenagers screech a lot too. Thought she was directed like that?
[3:39:59] <%dds333a> Don't worry we all have LUL
[3:40:01] <%lem______> AYY :LMAO THANKS
[3:40:01] <%The_Death_Owl> That gameplay was godlike, almost made me like Teddie as a character
[3:40:07] <%Shad0wTag> @lem______ No problem fam you were killing it
[3:40:09] <@Menitta> How many people would disagree if I said this is the best fighting game?
[3:40:21] <@Menitta> Because to me, I think it is
[3:40:22] <%dds333a> @heartlesshealer yet no one else LUL
[3:40:23] <%Heefnoff> It’s on my top 5 for sure @menitta
[3:40:28] <%Heefnoff> Probably number 3 for me
[3:40:31] <PKSomething> Teddie is good in P4 vanilla but everything after that characterized him as an annoying perv
[3:40:34] <Dragon_Batman> There was the windows sound
[3:40:35] <cartakus> It is pretty hype
[3:40:38] <marcomatame> think ill probably go with JP voices and try to mute Teddie and Rise's voices with mods.
[3:40:38] <%Irridium> @Menitta It's honestly the one I've had the most fun in.
[3:40:43] <heartlesshealer> @dds333a *text form shrug*
[3:40:44] <@Menitta> Like if not 1, its 2 or 3 at least
[3:40:48] <%The_Death_Owl> the ost makes it top 10 no contest
[3:40:54] <%Heefnoff> 3 for me @menitta
[3:40:56] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta I don't think there is alot of fighting games that are this faithful of their source material and be this good as a result
[3:41:04] <%Heefnoff> Number 1 is UMVC3 to me, number 2 is DBFZ
[3:41:24] <%Shad0wTag> @Heefnoff You are the leader of the Goku Rebellion after all right?
[3:41:28] <+Demoli_PT> i only got one and it fucked me up
[3:41:35] <%Heefnoff> Lol you know me
[3:41:36] <@Menitta> I wanna go back to UMVC3. I never fully dove in but after so much of playing 5SE Vergil, I wanna try him
[3:41:48] <%Heefnoff> Haha yeah that’s me @shad0wtag
[3:42:00] <%elderpunch> the booster didnt affect me in any way
[3:42:04] <Enn19> Oh I thought you don't wanna mix the first and second?
