[0:08:02] <+Great_Sage> I'd want Dante over Nero, although Nero would fit

[0:08:14] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> @WoolieVersus could you turn up the overall volume?
[0:08:14] <+DreyfussFrost> At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Dante got one.
[0:08:14] <Morning_Asakura> NICO IS CUTE BUT LADY WILL ALWAYS BE NUMBER ONE
[0:08:14] <Prevot> careful wool, don't breathe in that xbox dust
[0:08:14] <Deadpool2450> could you imagine?!?! DANTE IN SMASH
[0:08:14] <Oqzar> it looks really floaty though

[0:08:39] <+MMetas> Man capcom has too much presence already
[0:08:40] <+KawaiiJetty> Nero would work in Smash with the Rev mechanic
[0:08:40] <+DreyfussFrost> I'd rather have Dante, but I have to admit Nero has a more fitting moveset.
[0:08:48] <Invess> I love Nero's logo he ahs there

[0:11:38] <TrafficCohen> AIR TAUNT
[0:11:41] <Mr_Strut> That's cool
[0:11:43] <gustavozxd> run revving is the greatest
[0:11:43] <alrobot2014> it also maintains charge while doing hits
[0:11:45] <+thezkiller175> yeah it should come to ps4 later but not for pc
[0:11:46] <Ayru_> AIR TAUNT
[0:11:49] <TrueWarriorJak> Nero got buffed
[0:11:51] <gustavozxd> this game has some god tier animations too
[0:11:54] <+Austinck> Does the Demo have the song
[0:11:55] <SirAlan76> that's awesome
[0:11:56] <+GuelermeDias> YOU CAN RUN AROUND MAKING MOTORCYCLE NOISES WITH YOUR sword
[0:11:59] <+Candyman36> YEAAAHHH
[0:12:02] <King_Kth> Oh shit Nero is even more sick
[0:12:03] <Noctis_Fatehart> So good
[0:12:04] <cervidaequus> Nero gets MORE POWER
[0:12:04] <jase__x> Y E A H
[0:12:06] <Oqzar> but no launch off charge shot though
[0:12:06] <+thezkiller175> glad the demo can be played in 4k on one x though
[0:12:09] <alrobot2014> so you don't necessarily need to get the right timings for exceed
[0:12:11] <derovell> does that have i-frames?
[0:12:11] <Jigglebounce> WOOO
[0:12:11] <+Great_Sage> Can you do the running drop kick taunt still?
[0:12:12] <gustavozxd> this game has a whole lot of quips too
[0:12:13] <SaltyDongs> Yeahhhh
[0:12:14] <SuperUnhappyman> Neroes at his best when hes in the air
[0:12:14] <+MarshallLee67> I just joined holy shit those air tauntsa re sick
[0:12:16] <+comfyman12> Triple jump is a taunt
[0:12:18] <Prevot> nero is at his best in the air
[0:12:23] <Emdhad> is that taunt cancelable
[0:12:28] <gustavozxd> I feel like Nero talks in combat a whole lot more than usual
[0:12:29] <spoofy16> how hard is it to ex act?
[0:12:38] <itsya_boi_gappy> somehow they made dmc 4 nero better
[0:12:40] <TrafficCohen> @WoolieVersus Go wild with the arm destruction moves, they're handed out like candy
[0:12:43] <+badmr7> gun looks so nice
[0:12:46] <Paralurx> So would you say that this demo exceeds all your expectations???
[0:12:48] <gustavozxd> I still don't get how the gun works
[0:12:51] <ahninjas2> ghost chie
[0:12:57] <+thezkiller175> oh yeah theres a stash of red orbs on a staute in the demo
[0:12:57] <Sotetsu> A meat tornado...
[0:12:59] <+bonzosan> hows the game?
[0:13:00] <Finaldragoon> SourPls
[0:13:00] <Invess> The death screen in this is really good
[0:13:03] <+Great_Sage> Yo Nero got a strong jawline
[0:13:04] <+GuelermeDias> @Paralurx I'd say that's Ex-Act
[0:13:05] <+Great_Sage> I love it lol
[0:13:08] <Invess> It's like a SMT death screen
[0:13:11] <itsya_boi_gappy> @gustavozxd what you mean
[0:13:13] <kouhi12> SourPls

[0:13:38] <SinnerBeta> ex-catholic haircut, fit for dat trilby
[0:13:39] <Pyr0_Fr0st> Game looks great but I feel like they could've done more than broken glass on the ui
[0:13:43] <derovell> does the break away not actually use the arm's function?
[0:13:46] <Oqzar> but it knocks away instead of launch
[0:13:48] <+Austinck> Nero needs a Reebot beanie
[0:13:49] <Oqzar> so its worse
[0:13:51] <+elbigante> Is this yu narukami?
[0:13:57] <gustavozxd> @itsya_boi_gappy the whole charge shot system for nero that they changed, I feel like I'll have to actually play the game to understand how it works
[0:14:08] <TrueWarriorJak> I kind of hope they give Nero a proper DT in this game
[0:14:15] <stellar_flare> DO THE DROPKICK

[0:15:28] <Lion_kun> Anyone know how long the demo is?>
[0:15:31] <gyrobasel> Its literally just jumping off geometry thats been in the games since DMC1 lmao
[0:15:33] <Graxe_> I miss the hands from 1-3, though. You know, those hands that come out of the wall if you stay too close to them.
[0:15:34] <alrobot2014> its not long @Lion_kun
[0:15:35] <itsya_boi_gappy> @gustavozxd he is not fully upgraded in this demo and the shot works is you hold down shoot he fires it off and then you get 3 full charge shots
[0:15:38] <gustavozxd> this demo is probably on easy which is a great call tbh
[0:15:39] <Zerud> dear lord his revolver feels like a shotgun now
[0:15:40] <+MarshallLee67> basically a mission @Lion_kun
[0:15:40] <TrafficCohen> @Lion_kun Fairly short
[0:15:43] <eluded_> Woolie I don't think you can keep streaming this NSFW content here, Twitch will come for you
[0:15:44] <+thezkiller175> it ends when you beat the boss

[0:17:01] <+Ssaik> Gerbera + Air Taunt is like permanent air time
[0:17:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Nero is in his best in the air, Woolie
[0:17:09] <Lion_kun> Are there still yorbs?
[0:17:15] <+GuelermeDias> This looks Pretty Good

[0:17:23] <spawnzie> Oh fuck yes
[0:17:24] <+IMDRanged> SICK AIR
[0:17:26] <+steak_bentley> You can taunt multiple times in one jump
[0:17:27] <Invess> "Nero is at his best in the air"
[0:17:28] <MightyMaxT> Nero is at his best in the air @WoolieVersus
[0:17:28] <Graxe_> And that's all before doing an Air Hike.
[0:17:32] <faldin> who needs ground with air hikes like that
[0:17:34] <SailingSaturn> oh man the Secret Missions will hurt NotLikeThis
[0:17:34] <DXLelouch24> god i cant even imagine the challenge levels for this game
[0:17:37] <gustavozxd> so how is the dropkick, it's kinda annoying to do it in 4 because sprint takes longer to activate in combat
[0:17:39] <MihajloMBlood> Woolie streaming at a semi-euro friendly time? NANI??
[0:17:39] <+CommandThrowChavo> @woolieversus what system are you getting this for?
[0:17:42] <Dragonfang1337> I need this game injected into my fucking blood man
[0:17:46] <Lion_kun> ROM THE VACUOUS SPIDER
[0:17:57] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Hey woolie, did pat ever tell you the boss at the end of this is just a reused asset from Dragon dogma dark arisen?
[0:17:58] <+thezkiller175> taunt for the hood at b rank
[0:17:58] <gustavozxd> @sailingsaturn they better SwiftRage
[0:18:01] <+VVardy> Is the hood taunt in the game?
[0:18:17] <SsHomes> is a b rank or a rank taunt
[0:18:18] <Cobaltor_252> yes @VVardy
[0:18:18] <+superkeaton> Hood taunt is S, I think?
[0:18:19] <derovell> woolie, does the demo have nero's new aerial attack?
[0:18:21] <+bonzosan> there is a lot of talking in this game
[0:18:24] <+thezkiller175> its b rank
[0:18:28] <+superkeaton> aight
[0:18:30] <+LastHazzerd> yeyeyeye

[0:18:52] <JooseNeck> Do the demons get more durable after beating the demo?
[0:18:54] <Ardyn_1zunia> SEKRIT RORBO
[0:18:54] <TrafficCohen> I like Overture, it works as a sick counter
[0:18:55] <spawnzie> Gerbera is gonna be hard to beat for me
[0:18:56] <alexandrecau> gerbera is in his best in the air
[0:18:56] <+Nohamforsam> srorbs?

[0:18:57] <Niney_Who> VROOM
[0:18:57] <Lion_kun> WHY IS IT XBOX ONLY
[0:18:58] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus How hard are the basic enemies?
[0:19:00] <DXLelouch24> Woolie how do you feel that people will now have to git gud cause healing items are GONE?
[0:19:01] <traellium> SKKKKRT
[0:19:05] <gustavozxd> I don't have an xbox or a switch so the suffering is real
[0:19:07] <KexSad> are you running this on a regular xbox one and if so, is it running at 60 fps?
[0:19:07] <Lion_kun> FUCK YOU XBOX, YOU NEVER HAVE ANYTHING EXCLUSIVE I WANT
[0:19:08] <Oqzar> thats better than vergil
[0:19:14] <reonome> all these people regretting not getting an xbox LUL
[0:19:26] <AlasterAngelo> yo the air dash does damage?

[0:19:32] <Zerud> I regret nothing!
[0:19:33] <+Ssaik> PogChamp
[0:19:33] <Metalchaosmaster> it feels like the middle section of this mission is cut out with this loading screen or something
[0:19:36] <tank7013> @SailingSaturn Doesn't help that he always believes the first person in chat to call troll instead of the 20 others telling him how to do it
[0:19:37] <Sotetsu> Wow
[0:19:37] <+DatLatinoGuy> damn
[0:19:37] <gyrobasel> tfw xbox's best exclusive in years is a timed demo Kappa

[0:19:41] <pectusumbra> baphomet I heard?
[0:19:41] <SirBrawler18> SAVAGE
[0:19:44] <NarcissistCactus> I wouldn't buy an xbox for a demo
[0:19:45] <+VVardy> Fucking hell I love laughing and having fun Nero
[0:19:45] <jonathandemel> How tough is the style system?
[0:19:45] <Videogamer4> GOTTA LET IT OUT GOTTA LET IT OUT
[0:19:47] <Foymic> kinda good in small rooms
[0:19:50] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus have you seen the ground charge version?
[0:19:52] <King_Kth> Oh god! I just noticed in the top left, how the camera is reflected/ refracted in the cracked UI! Thats dope
[0:19:53] <Graxe_> I hope that the red orbs have a bit more glow on them like in past games. Since they look like actual crystals in DMC5, they can be a bit hard to notice them.
[0:19:53] <Lion_kun> because of DmC I keep expecting an SSS
[0:19:57] <TrafficCohen> @gyrobasel As a Xbox owner I am sad at the truth
[0:20:05] <Invess> there's a hidden Rorb up there
[0:20:08] <gustavozxd> I hope you can leave the UI on permanently
[0:20:09] <Niney_Who> Gee I wonder who made a giant tower in the middle of the city
[0:20:11] <DXLelouch24> and keep in m,ind the demo is prob set to easy
[0:20:15] <SsHomes> gerbera in enclosed space is pretty broken
[0:20:16] <MihajloMBlood> Taunt tech
[0:20:16] <DXLelouch24> style wont be this easy to get
[0:20:17] <+MarshallLee67> fuck i want this demo to come to pc/ps4 so bad
[0:20:17] <+LastHazzerd> is the demo time locked? or is it where once you got it you got it

[0:25:43] <SirBrawler18> power vacuum?
[0:25:46] <gustavozxd> I wanna know V's voice actor cuz I love his voice
[0:25:46] <SunPraiser> his chest looks like daemon from Dragon's Dogma
[0:25:46] <Lion_kun> do a perfect counter woolie
[0:25:46] <SailingSaturn> Theres a shakeup for sure cirTan
[0:25:52] <+LastHazzerd> Heart burn
[0:25:53] <AlasterAngelo> well both Mundus and Berial are dead so there's no king rn
[0:26:00] <itsya_boi_gappy> @WoolieVersus during the fight he talks about some fruits
[0:26:00] <GohanEgret> an opening in the underworld? guess DmC is canon Kappa
[0:26:04] <Mythundare> It's Wyald WutFace
[0:26:09] <Niney_Who> DO IT NO BALLS
[0:26:10] <Fenrirlives> There is undoubtedly a power vacuum from Berial and Mundus' death. I think the Tree is an election process of some kind!
[0:26:10] <RantingRavager> ROYAL GUARD
[0:26:10] <Lion_kun> DO IT COWARD
[0:26:11] <jonathandemel> TRY
[0:26:11] <MartiusGW> since when belial was king?
[0:26:11] <Graxe_> There was always a seat open since DMC1. And then Berial ruled in after Mundus, but you know.
[0:26:13] <alrobot2014> YOU CAN DEFELCT IT???
[0:26:14] <DaedalusKrael> wasn't there a new King in DMC2?
[0:26:14] <PlumpPotatoRump> nice
[0:26:14] <SinnerBeta> power vacuum
[0:26:15] <Bevral> do it
[0:26:15] <+morow1ec> DO IT
[0:26:16] <shamuzu> DO IT
[0:26:17] <LKaio> Do it majinoPoint
[0:26:17] <DXLelouch24> DO IT YOU COWARD
[0:26:17] <+MarshallLee67> i saw somebody deflect it with a reverse calibur it was fucking sick
[0:26:18] <gustavozxd> goddamn it of course you can reflect that shit LUL
[0:26:18] <DeanX27> @AlasterAngelo Mundus was sealed away, not killed
[0:26:18] <+TylerDoesTwitch> See if you can kill him in the second stage
[0:26:18] <Mythundare> Does this game have a drop kick?
[0:26:19] <tank7013> We all know you're gonna try it though
[0:26:20] <Tacotouchdown> I think Vergil may be the new main baddie or just another lieutenant in someone else's army
[0:26:21] <+Remery_> But girls are watching
[0:26:26] <jojodemi> drop kick is in
[0:26:27] <+GuelermeDias> lol nero is such a shithead now
[0:26:27] <SailingSaturn> Man I wonder how all the Devil Breakers work for each boss cirGreed
[0:26:29] <mistermastergreg> you can deflect it in the air
[0:26:33] <spawnzie> If the spot of the demon king is open you can bet Vergil's gunning for it
[0:26:33] <AlasterAngelo> @DeanX27 eh he's inactive all the same
[0:26:34] <PunishedRaccoon> @WoolieVersus what if sparda never died and this is a full demon sparda at the throne
[0:26:36] <SsHomes> belial was the king of the fire hell, maybe implies different areas
[0:26:36] <+morow1ec> Lame it out like it's DMC2
[0:26:39] <+steak_bentley> r o y a l g u a r d
[0:26:42] <GoldeNOVA> I see some Dragon's Dogma tech
[0:26:46] <rytyoung> dat look good
[0:26:47] <gustavozxd> V has to be related to mundus somehow cuz he has all these dmc1 enemies as summons and shit
[0:26:49] <denam_of_windscale> @Mythundare yeah drop kick is in
[0:26:50] <Zerud> I really wonder if you will play the same stages with all 3 characters, last trailer had V fighting this boss right?
[0:26:51] <thebiganxiety> Ya reckon goliath is nightmares son? Odd question i know
[0:26:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> This is very darksouls ish
[0:26:54] <Mythundare> @denam_of_windscale ty
[0:26:55] <Metalchaosmaster> thats some really forgiving hitboxes
[0:26:59] <MartiusGW> i thought he called himself conqueror of fire hell
[0:27:01] <gustavozxd> IN GAME TRANSITION THANK GOD
[0:27:02] <Dragonfang1337> Wow I didn't know there was a dark souls 4
[0:27:02] <SsHomes> weird scripted jump
[0:27:12] <SirAlan76> The music is pretty good
[0:27:12] <+Blankets_and_Tea> gerbera is just the best
[0:27:12] <MartiusGW> still not really king of whole underworld
[0:27:15] <Graxe_> I'm seeing a lot of moves used from Ogres and Cyclopes from Dragon's Dogma.
[0:27:16] <Nagubanaga> So B is finally Badass huh
[0:27:16] <Fenrirlives> @WoolieVersus we doin S rank Mission my dude!
[0:27:17] <+bonzosan> the team did make dragon's dogma didnt they
[0:27:18] <LunaticOfGodsCreation> its wild that some demons still dont know about Dante, nero and vergil, youd think thered be at least rumors goin around in hell that goes like "yo if you see a human with white hair, they're not hujman, they're spardas offspring and will fuck you up"
[0:27:19] <MightyMaxT> Okay, say the twist of this game is Vergil is the new King of Hell. Should he have an actual crown?
[0:27:19] <+Great_Sage> im waiting for the grabs
[0:27:21] <gustavozxd> if this was DmC there would be like 4 cutscenes just for that stage transition
[0:27:22] <GoogleyGareth> Look at our debris teeeeeech
[0:27:23] <reiju_22> people are pissed because you have to restart the demo when you die to him
[0:27:25] <+MarshallLee67> the camera is so good here oh my god
[0:27:27] <kaine_west> man this is fucking cool
[0:27:28] <+DatLatinoGuy> oh nice they kept the health bar in the reticle
[0:27:30] <Amasepyt> By the way this boss theme is up on youtube right now
[0:27:34] <Nagubanaga> yo but this debristech is LEGIT
[0:27:36] <+LastHazzerd> oh...
[0:27:38] <Graxe_> Yeah, Itsuno worked on Dragon's Dogma after DMC4.
[0:27:38] <AlasterAngelo> @bonzosan i don't know about the whole team, but DD is Itsuno's baby
[0:27:39] <MyNameIsRasus> @mightymaxt he should have a fedora
[0:27:40] <+LastHazzerd> you can go outside?
[0:27:45] <alexandrecau> not enough survivor to tell about the sparda sons
[0:27:49] <spawnzie> So the grabs are limited to specific arm now right?
[0:27:50] <+LastHazzerd> OH MY GOD
[0:27:52] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> No petal ray in the church?
[0:27:56] <Mr_Strut> Love the reload sound

[0:28:06] <etalmeta> @spawnzie it's only the buster arm
[0:28:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @LunaticOfGodsCreation I like to think that its been a while and not enough demons survive to tell the tale
[0:28:12] <ahninjas2> this suddenly became red faction
[0:28:13] <+JayEarly> @LunaticOfGodsCreation the problem is that many of them didn't survive the encounter
[0:28:15] <+LastHazzerd> The cathedral was just a prop??
[0:28:16] <ahninjas2> and im ok with that
[0:28:19] <+Remery_> Cut his tail off :)
[0:28:22] <jonathandemel> I love that the demons do taunts and you can interrupt them

[0:32:32] <TrafficCohen> THIS INTRO
[0:32:33] <SirAlan76> capcom game with money Kreygasm
[0:32:33] <+KSabot> fuckin rip
[0:32:34] <2017y> @WoolieVersus The Xbox One All In One Entertainment System
[0:32:36] <+JayEarly> what a fucking menu screen
[0:32:36] <+VVardy> Not PC?
[0:32:37] <Angry_Ev1L> CAPCOM IS SO BACK
[0:32:42] <+thezkiller175> or pc
[0:32:42] <Klefth> @JayEarly Because, surely, getting the demo on all platforms wouldn't benefit Capcom considerably more, right? lol
[0:32:43] <TrafficCohen> GOOOOOOD GOD THIS INTRO
[0:32:45] <+Debuggingfool> why not pc?
[0:32:46] <DXLelouch24> did you get the PS4 theme?
[0:32:46] <+Ssaik> GOD that looks sick
[0:32:47] <gustavozxd> that's my default too
[0:32:47] <SunPraiser> title screen is a bit like reveangance innit
[0:32:48] <+DatLatinoGuy> need a V demo
[0:32:49] <+LastHazzerd> I hope hope hope Nero gets some sick wings
[0:32:51] <keiji_maede> so..... now i wan a xbox?
[0:32:55] <+CrazyRainbows> I can't believe I'm gonna triple dip on DMC5.
[0:32:58] <jonathandemel> WHAT
[0:32:58] <keiji_maede> hate
[0:32:59] <spoofy16> why not pc?
[0:33:00] <Kristoffers> not since senran kagura
[0:33:00] <gustavozxd> I hope there's more music dlc
[0:33:01] <+hardwiredfire> This is one of the few games I'm actually gonna preorder. I don't do it often anymore, but this definitely seems worth it.
[0:33:06] <Kejang> wont it run better on xbone
[0:33:08] <+comfyman12> Go look up Nico's Van theme, it's fucking great
[0:33:09] <DXLelouch24> PLS GIVE US A VERGIL VOCIEPACK
[0:33:10] <MightyMaxT> Looks amazing, just wish it was a LITTLE more saturated. The colors need to pop a bit, imo
[0:33:11] <kaine_west> it feels wrong playing Devil May Cry on anything but PC or Playstation
[0:33:12] <rufus2k2> Just imagine in new game plus they give you Nero with recovered arm
[0:33:12] <gustavozxd> I want cerberus original theme as a regular battle theme
[0:33:14] <gustavozxd> WAIT
[0:33:15] <Fenrirlives> It'd be so cool if the intro animation was different for every character you were last using!
[0:33:15] <spawnzie> Go for real now
[0:33:16] <jojodemi> Lady as announcer would be great
[0:33:16] <EBT93> I need this demo on PS4 asap
[0:33:18] <gustavozxd> AUTO SKIP CUTSCENES
[0:33:19] <mistermastergreg> JAPANESE DUB
[0:33:20] <gustavozxd> WHAT
[0:33:21] <PlumpPotatoRump> hell yh!
[0:33:21] <+Dovakhin573> Woolie what if this title screen is foreshadowing neros dt?
[0:33:21] <Graxe_> S-rank, no Breaker speed run?
[0:33:23] <Luvinsus> LIMITERS ARE OFF
[0:33:24] <KnivesEve> so that giant V is part of nero's devil trigger right?
[0:33:25] <+TekkieX> Microsoft has marketing rights I hear, thus Xbox only demo
[0:33:34] <gustavozxd> OH MY GOD AUTO SKIP IS WHAT I WANTED THE MOST
[0:33:38] <DXLelouch24> nah tekkie the demo is on Xbox first
[0:33:40] <gustavozxd> ahem sorry, holy shit
[0:33:41] <DXLelouch24> not just xbox
[0:33:45] <+thezkiller175> oh yeah the only devil may cry games that has dual audio now
[0:33:47] <+CrazyRainbows> I just really, really hope turbo gets patched in like BP. I need that speed amp
[0:33:47] <TrafficCohen> TRY OUT OVERTURE
[0:33:48] <+JayEarly> @Klefth it would benefit Capcom more, but having an exclusive demo benefits Microsoft tit for tat
[0:33:52] <Oqzar> does charging even do anything in 5?
[0:33:52] <SailingSaturn> @WoolieVersus you think that missing button is his DT button?
[0:33:56] <+superkeaton> SourPls
[0:33:56] <gustavozxd> good ass ost
[0:33:57] <PlumpPotatoRump> i have gun on r2 and exceed on r1
[0:33:58] <Nickhead93> Which Xbox is he playing the game on?
[0:33:58] <Youknowwhyimhere008> atpHarada üéª
[0:34:00] <+LastHazzerd> Spanish guitar~
[0:34:01] <+TylerDoesTwitch> I always swap DT and gun
[0:34:02] <SsHomes> guitar SourPls

[0:34:10] <+TekkieX> Well, timed or not.
[0:34:13] <gustavozxd> I got used to square for gun
[0:34:13] <+maleficarqm> What is that instrumental?
[0:34:13] <itsya_boi_gappy> i agree with you woolie, idk why pat plays his nero like that
[0:34:15] <GohanEgret> woolie's m o t i v a t e d

[0:34:15] <Prevot> woolie getting HOT
[0:34:15] <Videogamer4> donte is playing that guitar
[0:34:18] <LKaio> with lock-on on rb it's wierd
[0:34:27] <Graxe_> Yeah, you need separate fingers on RT and RB.
[0:34:28] <+MarshallLee67> for dmc4 i put my DT on RT and the gun on LB
[0:34:30] <metaphase72> I was you could change the input for helm spitter to forward instead of backwards
[0:34:30] <Metalchaosmaster> well Im glad that xbox is helping dmc with the advertising tho. playstation likes to push their movie games more than anything. but im still getting it for my pro
[0:34:34] <+RJay80> woolie shedding his weighted clothes
[0:34:39] <SsHomes> el donte on guitar?
[0:34:40] <Maharbear> is the full game going to be out on PC like the others?

[0:34:47] <graemecrackers1> play devil trigger
[0:34:50] <pirateofpie> Did he just start?
[0:34:52] <enveeart> i thought the screen shake was just nero's sprint
[0:34:56] <+JayEarly> @Maharbear there's a Steam page

[0:35:06] <GohanEgret> @pirateofpie about 35 minutes
[0:35:12] <SunPraiser> red queen doesn't go higher than level 2 in the demo?
[0:35:14] <Maharbear> Awesome >:3
[0:35:16] <awesomeguyrequiem> Being able to run and exceed like that will probably get me using that more
[0:35:16] <pirateofpie> Gotcha, thanks
[0:35:18] <gustavozxd> these insane looking effects
[0:35:20] <jase__x> SICK
[0:35:23] <yourwaifuispoop> are combos b and c in the demo?

[0:38:07] <+JayEarly> Gerbera is cool but I like slapping demons around with a giant electric hand
[0:38:08] <+steak_bentley> @Lion_kun they cycle when they break and you pick them up through the level

[0:38:16] <+DatLatinoGuy> downloaded it, haven't listened to it yet, will do later
[0:38:16] <EnderGamma> I save podcasts for long office hours. Makes the day go by so much faster.
[0:38:17] <Shishi1205> its cool

[0:38:19] <pandapanzerai> dude the podcast is great

[0:38:22] <GohanEgret> oh man you can dash, wild after seeing 14 parts of DmC
[0:38:25] <Soapydishwater> Also you should have plague on regularly
[0:38:25] <tacostarvedbeast> ayyyyeee woolie san, get those sick styles
[0:38:28] <theend786> But what are you figuring out tho?
[0:38:29] <masterfire23> the episodes were so good.
[0:38:29] <teflonbilly777> (Robert DeNiro voice) I hear good things!
[0:38:32] <Lion_kun> what breaks the devil breakers?
[0:38:34] <Shishi1205> woolievspodcast.com
[0:38:35] <SsHomes> @woolieversus there's an open secret on the building
[0:38:44] <+superkeaton> Podcasts... I need MORE podcasts!
[0:38:49] <rufus2k2> noice
[0:38:50] <+bonzosan> its a fascinating podcast
[0:38:52] <wired_soul> i cant find it on castbox
[0:38:53] <MysteriousToad> Great idea for a podcast
[0:38:57] <+attackofthesage> Poor max couldn't figure out how to get on the horse haha
[0:38:57] <GoldeNOVA> HOTel
[0:39:01] <masterfire23> i would like to have plague shit on my game ideas
[0:39:02] <Invess> it's weird that the demo skips the hotel fight
[0:39:04] <SsHomes> on the alley
[0:39:05] <+Zaku_42> How's the game so far Woolie?
[0:39:05] <itsya_boi_gappy> getting hit when using it @Lion_kun
[0:39:07] <denam_of_windscale> @Lion_kun each arm has a move that breaks it
[0:39:09] <+steak_bentley> @Lion_kun either using their super move, getting hit while using their normal move or just making one explode on purpose as an animation cancel i think
[0:39:10] <+chiluzza> he says as he franticallyt crumples up the previous script about what they talked about on the SBFP cast
[0:39:11] <+hardwiredfire> So, what happens if you run out of arms?
[0:39:12] <teflonbilly777> I've dl'd both eps to listen to in bed later. Gonna get my Woolz lulling me to sleep
[0:39:12] <utterheartstrike> on the alley
[0:39:13] <SsHomes> just some red orb clusters
[0:39:16] <Maharbear> Is Nero still going on about "KIRIA"?
[0:39:16] <utterheartstrike> to the right
[0:39:16] <+AhmCha> How many times have you played the demo Wools?
[0:39:17] <rufus2k2> that sound
[0:39:20] <dukenux> PogChamp
[0:39:20] <rufus2k2> so classic
[0:39:23] <Lion_kun> thanks guys
[0:39:24] <teflonbilly777> The secret is just a little room with two red orb plants
[0:39:25] <Lion_kun> that's sick
[0:39:26] <Metalchaosmaster> run is ded
[0:39:29] <theend786> Lion_kun getting hit while using it, a Break Age move and BreakAway
[0:39:29] <isolex_> @WoolieVersus Do we know if the demo contains a dante segmant or just nero?
[0:39:32] <dukenux> I didn't know you will play the demo
[0:39:37] <AlasterAngelo> good old worthless prides
[0:39:39] <+GuelermeDias> "i like bursting one in here" Kreygasm
[0:39:41] <dukenux> im an idiot
[0:39:44] <SirAlan76> this room reminds me of the bar in dmc3
[0:39:47] <AlasterAngelo> or maybe those are lusts?
[0:39:47] <gustavozxd> why is he calling out the arm's name LUL oh nero
[0:39:47] <TakesGuts> overture final attack is command grab?
[0:39:49] <+attackofthesage> Is it true there's no enemy step in this demo?
[0:39:52] <+Ssaik> Give me Tomboy gameplay üò°
[0:39:55] <reiju_22> is this anor londo
[0:39:56] <californaya> because anime
[0:40:00] <+comfyman12> Something that threw me off going from DMC4 to DMC3 was that enemies didn't really have a sound queue as they're about to attack, as far as I could tell
[0:40:00] <jonathandemel> THE LINES ON THE GROUND
[0:40:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Whats the hoody taunt
[0:40:03] <+JayEarly> @attackofthesage yep
[0:40:08] <KaiserMario> !uptime
[0:40:09] <dukenux> Is this the Bar from DMC3?
[0:40:10] <Ardyn_1zunia> Would a retry checkpoint thing for certain rooms be a pleb move?
[0:40:10] <+MarshallLee67> FRU STRA TION
[0:40:11] <+comfyman12> *DMC3 to DMC4
[0:40:12] <+attackofthesage> dang that suck haha
[0:40:12] <MyNameIsRasus> S A V A G E
[0:40:15] <+Great_Sage> yo I love devil trigger lol
[0:40:16] <+commanderclaw> I can't believe enemy step now gives DT
[0:40:16] <+Ssaik> BANG BANG BANG
[0:40:17] <Prevot> SourPls
[0:40:17] <gustavozxd> dude I just want to see how the air skate arm works
[0:40:18] <Krando> @WoolieVersus will there be another friday night fisticuffs of Tekken 7 when all the season 2 chars are released?
[0:40:19] <EBT93> PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[0:40:19] <Amasepyt> which devil breakers do you guys like more?
[0:40:20] <+RowenCleric> god Gerbera looks so good
[0:40:26] <GohanEgret> THE GOOD SHIT
[0:40:26] <dukenux> GET TING BIG GER
[0:40:27] <Metalchaosmaster> wish you could unlock the higher difficulties for this mission at least
[0:40:27] <alrobot2014> is there a way to change the direction input for helmsplitter?
[0:40:29] <+GuelermeDias> KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAA
[0:40:30] <kaine_west> ye boi
[0:40:31] <+Ssaik> Kreygasm
[0:40:32] <+AhmCha> God I want it, I want it so bad.
[0:40:34] <+attackofthesage> THE GOOD SHIT
[0:40:36] <teflonbilly777> The demo is awesome. I played through it a few times last night. Short, but gave you a good sense of the action. I'm still ass at DMC though, so I never got a bigger combo than S and a better mission rank than A
[0:40:38] <AlasterAngelo> yeah the people who say this is slow probably don't know how to play this
[0:40:38] <isolex_> THE GOOOOOD SHIT
[0:40:40] <tank7013> One of the buildings has a hole on the second floor with some more rorbs in it
[0:40:43] <kaine_west> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:40:46] <+LastHazzerd> Has Nero said the Fuck word?
[0:40:47] <iziwings> these goobers look kinda like the goobers from 3 huh
[0:40:49] <stellar_flare> Hey Woolie can you dodge out of the arm breakers?
[0:40:54] <PlumpPotatoRump> I wonder if dante swears?
[0:40:57] <+commanderclaw> @WoolieVersus Enemy step now gives DT
[0:41:01] <dukenux> Is this Fortuna?
[0:41:01] <+BaronBattle> aww the glassbreak hud looks cool
[0:41:03] <+attackofthesage> It's only slow for me because I play turbo only usually haha
[0:41:05] <Oqzar> nero needs air launcher or something so you can combo into that
[0:41:06] <+Shotgundam009> NotLikeThis
[0:41:09] <AlasterAngelo> TWICE THE EMBARRASSMENT
[0:41:09] <+comfyman12> Do enemies have audio queues like in 3?
[0:41:11] <shamuzu> BALLS EXPOSED
[0:41:13] <+megamonmon123> the worst thing about this demo is that its TOO SHORT
[0:41:14] <dukenux> im sorry, i mean *Is this Anor Londo?
[0:41:15] <+attackofthesage> IT DOES
[0:41:15] <+Ssaik> Wait huh
[0:41:17] <+JayEarly> I hope Nero says "Fuck" and Dante continues not to swear
[0:41:18] <+steak_bentley> love nero but i would do wild shit just to try balrog BibleThump
[0:41:21] <teflonbilly777> @RowenCleric I love the Gerbera, you look so slick when you add it in a combo
[0:41:21] <Scrub_Seeker> @PlumpPotatoRump in his demo he says the line "i just woke up from a long-ass nap"
[0:41:22] <+AhmCha> Is there a snatch breaker?
[0:41:22] <SirAlan76> so much air time
[0:41:23] <+attackofthesage> INFINITE DT
[0:41:23] <Revant_tillywink> @WoolieVersus how do you feel about having to pick up the arms as apposed to picking which ones you want at the start?
[0:41:25] <EBT93> It does?!
[0:41:25] <+Ssaik> That's insane
[0:41:26] <awesomeguyrequiem> Dante says "pain in the ass" in one mission if I remember
[0:41:26] <+Great_Sage> AWW HE CAN DO IT
[0:41:26] <TrafficCohen> IT AINT IN THE DEMO THO
[0:41:26] <stellar_flare> WHIFF MASTER
[0:41:26] <arfsm95> what's the new DT?
[0:41:28] <+Great_Sage> YEEEEE
[0:41:29] <Lion_kun> Whyare there gerberas lying around
[0:41:32] <Oqzar> thats busted
[0:41:35] <gustavozxd> dropkick miss LUL
[0:41:39] <theend786> @woolieversus hey what‚Äôs cool about Gerbera‚Äôs air multi shot ray is that it‚Äôs not random. It‚Äôll direct to whoever you‚Äôre locked on to.
[0:41:41] <TrafficCohen> @Lion_kun SHHHH BE QUIET
[0:41:43] <+BaronBattle> god this looks sooooooooo goooooooood
[0:41:43] <itsya_boi_gappy> i wonder if dante will get more devil arms
[0:41:49] <+JayEarly> @Lion_kun Because Nico is Best Girl
[0:41:52] <rufus2k2> @WoolieVersus think future DLC will have something like Episode of V giving his backstory?
[0:41:54] <nnif> So how does Demifiend fit into this?
[0:42:01] <SsHomes> he said ass in dmc4 when he talks about nero messing up after the second fight
[0:42:03] <TakesGuts> @WoolieVersus early thoughtson V? we chaos legion now?
[0:42:04] <AlasterAngelo> overture has a command grab doesn't it
[0:42:08] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> on
[0:42:14] <rufus2k2> Demifiend too strong
[0:42:14] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> no,
[0:42:14] <+comfyman12> Judging from the trailer, you know shit's dire when Dante gets serious for once
[0:42:16] <grayjammer> Satisfun
[0:42:19] <+attackofthesage> Charged overture is gonna lead to some awesome looking combo enders
[0:42:20] <wired_soul> hes vrooming up his gun ???
[0:42:21] <SsHomes> don't think it's that heavy of a swear though
[0:42:23] <+BaronBattle> wait you have ammo on the arm?
[0:42:26] <teflonbilly777> @SsHomes Ass isn't a swear word
[0:42:27] <tank7013> Holy shit I'm just noticing the new UI element for the exceed gauge. That's awesome
[0:42:34] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> the break age has you plant a bomb in a demon
[0:42:35] <+RowenCleric> does an arm do devil breaker grabs and throws?
[0:42:40] <Lion_kun> apparently V and the Villain might be both halves of Vergil
[0:42:44] <gameaholic42> What is Overture's break age move?
[0:42:44] <gustavozxd> or mundus
[0:42:45] <+AhmCha> Wait Lady's brother?
[0:42:45] <Lion_kun> the good and the bad side
[0:42:46] <+GuelermeDias> DMC5 is gonna give us Episode of Goku
[0:42:47] <dukenux> So does the demo only cover Nero?
[0:42:48] <+VVardy> There has to be a pre-arm torn off Nero episode where you still have your Devil Bringer
[0:42:49] <kaine_west> just like the Hapsburgs
[0:42:50] <+megamonmon123> @woolieversus so have the hype levels changed with this demo?
[0:42:51] <AlasterAngelo> i'm thinking V is a Mundus doll like Trish
[0:42:51] <alrobot2014> tons of incest
[0:42:51] <+attackofthesage> @WoolieVersus Did you hear the theory that V is Mundus?
[0:42:52] <itsya_boi_gappy> vergils other son LUL
[0:42:53] <+AlwaysHuffer> @RowenCleric yeah its the buster arm,not int he demo
[0:42:53] <+Ssaik> splorch
[0:42:53] <Ardyn_1zunia> V will absolutely be the final boss
[0:42:54] <+steak_bentley> the breakers remind me of the roulette orbs from god hand TakeNRG
[0:42:54] <ThirdStrike_Alex> Nah V is totally Virgil's other kid
[0:42:54] <+Remery_> One Big Orgy
[0:42:57] <+commanderclaw> FAMILY, Family, family...
[0:42:57] <Metalchaosmaster> motherrr
[0:42:57] <cherubsanonymous> Best theory I've heard is that he's a golem.
[0:42:58] <TrafficCohen> IT'S ABOUT FAMILY- CARRIE FISHER
[0:42:59] <stellar_flare> splorch
[0:42:59] <dukenux> Just like Skywalkers
[0:43:00] <+AhmCha> Lady's ONII-CHAN
[0:43:02] <SsHomes> some people consider it a swear, i don't, just saying
[0:43:02] <Graxe_> But then how does V summon Griffon, Nightmare, and a Shadow?
[0:43:03] <PunishedRaccoon> @WoolieVersus V could be nero's half brother
[0:43:03] <gustavozxd> all the dlc are gonna feature agnus as the protag
[0:43:04] <+D2_Synua> We're obviously going to get enough story in-game
[0:43:06] <+RowenCleric> ok good
[0:43:07] <+ravenrooke> V is Vergil. Like Tobi was Obito. Its obvious!
[0:43:08] <theblueriotbot> My bet is V is related to Mundus
[0:43:10] <+JayEarly> @cherubsanonymous what
[0:43:11] <Bonerlord911> V is mundus's son
[0:43:12] <sirjonston> So Lady and V are the goth siblings
[0:43:13] <+GuelermeDias> Yeah, V has gotta be Nero's lil' brother, right.
[0:43:13] <ghostravens> i really wish we get to play as lady at some point, even if it's in a dlc
[0:43:13] <ThirdStrike_Alex> V is Virgil
[0:43:15] <dukenux> makes sense
[0:43:16] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus Summoned canes though
[0:43:18] <devilrnaycry> they said it was red clusters
[0:43:18] <rufus2k2> so sick that he's using a Shadow from DMC1 as a striker
[0:43:19] <+SammyOVision> I love the 2d shader on the arms section of the UI to make it read easier.
[0:43:20] <+Remery_> One Big Incest Orgy :)
[0:43:20] <d_wagon> Go back
[0:43:21] <+BaronBattle> Dante playable in the demo?
[0:43:23] <itsya_boi_gappy> V has summon canes
[0:43:24] <Saul_dlc> griffon, shadow and nightmare are related to mundus and V
[0:43:24] <ThirdStrike_Alex> V is Virgil's kid
[0:43:29] <MelBrooksKA> FAMILY... Family.. family
[0:43:30] <+hardwiredfire> @Remery_ That would be the gayest incest orgy
[0:43:30] <teflonbilly777> Dante being a virgin is canon right? I mean vergil is throwing jizz all over the place it seems
[0:43:31] <dukenux> being Arkham's son explains why he's a dark magick goth boy
[0:43:34] <iziwings> i wanna call him being a mundus creation but i also don't know if mundus is relevant enough for them to do that anymore
[0:43:34] <+megamonmon123> @baronbattle no
[0:43:37] <Oqzar> @WoolieVersus you can rev mid air taunt
[0:43:38] <devilrnaycry> they said it was red orb clusters on the building
[0:43:39] <gustavozxd> also V has some noctis moves
[0:43:40] <flagi64> thoughts on new version of Sub-human?
[0:43:42] <purple_bagel> He said it was just red orbs i think
[0:43:43] <Lion_kun> Apparently if you alter the pitch of the villain's voice, he sounds like Vergil
[0:43:45] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> V can run
[0:43:46] <gustavozxd> he can run though
[0:43:49] <DXLelouch24> can you remap controls in the demo?
[0:43:49] <SsHomes> @woolieversus in the first area, in the alley, the second floor has a hole with red orbs inside
[0:43:49] <+Ssaik> He can, in fact, run
[0:43:51] <SirAlan76> V could be one of Agnus' experiments
[0:43:53] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> just not when summoning demons
[0:43:53] <Metalchaosmaster> white hair = cool
[0:43:54] <Sokumotanaka> Isn't V a summoner?
[0:43:56] <+Ssaik> was shown in a 17-second ggameplay sample
[0:43:57] <+mcjimbo12> Lion_kun i didn't even think you had to alter the pitch tbh
[0:43:58] <gustavozxd> he was walking because of the lock on
[0:43:59] <teflonbilly777> @WoolieVersus The secret is basically a tiny room with two rorb clusters in a hole in the wall
[0:44:01] <Afrobrawler> V is probly just a experiment with vergils dna like those soldiers from the order
[0:44:01] <+ravenrooke> @WoolieVersus I saw V has white hair. Do we know why?
[0:44:02] <+Remery_> @hardwiredfire good fit for 2018
[0:44:02] <+DatLatinoGuy> I love everything about V
[0:44:02] <isolex_> Missed the phone >:L
[0:44:04] <NarcissistCactus> V could be _____
[0:44:11] <Rexenexus> He looks like Dragons Dogma sorcerer Kreygasm
[0:44:17] <+SodiusChubz> V just good chaos legion
[0:44:18] <+drefizz> I liked Big the cat...
[0:44:19] <iziwings> he can run a little at least and shadow gives him movement abilities apparently
[0:44:25] <SsHomes> lol
[0:44:26] <rufus2k2> his upgrade's probably have something akin to sprint
[0:44:26] <+goose_attack_almanac> What if V is the result of drunk Dante and Lady
[0:44:30] <+Zaku_42> you know what V stands for? Varkham
[0:44:31] <SsHomes> woolie got this
[0:44:33] <+GuelermeDias> I think V has Concentration Meter, that's why they're pushing him as a slow walker.
[0:44:34] <rufus2k2> might even give him a float
[0:44:36] <iziwings> imagine if panther within PogChamp
[0:44:36] <nnif> SSX
[0:44:36] <+thezkiller175> So V has a DT
[0:44:38] <Lion_kun> V is the child of Lady and Trish
[0:44:38] <Tacotouchdown> V is what a neckbeard thinks he is
[0:44:40] <+bthevboi> I love his theme tbh (crimson clouds is totally mundus)
[0:44:41] <TrafficCohen> Ridin' high
[0:44:46] <teflonbilly777> @goose_attack_almanac Are you callinG dante a motherfucker?
[0:44:46] <TrafficCohen> Let's get airborne
[0:44:47] <+GuelermeDias> Dante has never had sex..
[0:44:50] <+drefizz> Lets get airborne
[0:44:50] <wired_soul> SMOrc
[0:44:52] <+GuelermeDias> So V can't be Dante's son.
[0:44:55] <+DatLatinoGuy> we made a theory in the SBFP Discord that V is Mundus' son: angel motif, cracked sin, using DMC 1 minions
[0:44:55] <+GuelermeDias> Dante is a wizard now.
[0:44:56] <SsHomes> shadow summons seems to be fast
[0:45:02] <nobody12349> Woolie did you borrow Crazy Talk? V can run.
[0:45:02] <teflonbilly777> Dante is too busy eating pizza for sex
[0:45:03] <+Great_Sage> yoooooo im digging neros' gun changes
[0:45:03] <+comfyman12> I've seen someone beat Goliath before he collapses the roof
[0:45:06] <stellar_flare> V is like that mall goth with a $30 katana, but when you make fun of him, he uses it to cut your car in half.
[0:45:08] <+steak_bentley> dante is an ace icon
[0:45:08] <teflonbilly777> Dante is volcel
[0:45:10] <Metalchaosmaster> Dante is a pure virgin boy
[0:45:12] <+megamonmon123> @thezkiller175 v is a stand user who's hair turns white when he uses act 3
[0:45:13] <+Ssaik> Nero's voice is sounding GOOOOOOD
[0:45:21] <Tacotouchdown> virgin Dante vs Chad Donte
[0:45:21] <+drefizz> Dante is a level 40 wizard
[0:45:22] <+BaronBattle> damn this is so crazy
[0:45:23] <+mcjimbo12> I kind of want a boss to start shouting "FUCK YOUUU" at Dante and Dante is just like "woah what the hell man chill out"
[0:45:24] <rufus2k2> goddamn what kind of ammo is Nero using that a single shot is akin to flak?
[0:45:26] <gustavozxd> V can literally teleport behind you LUL
[0:45:27] <iziwings> idk about his son but i feel like he's some kind of mundus creation like trish
[0:45:29] <+thezkiller175> Thats even better
[0:45:30] <+BaronBattle> holy shit
[0:45:31] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> petal ray!!
[0:45:31] <ELJOVENBATALI> Who's more pure, Dante or Kiryu?
[0:45:35] <+GuelermeDias> Nico makes good shit, man.
[0:45:35] <teflonbilly777> It's crazy how much Nero looks liek Cody Rhodes now
[0:45:40] <dukenux> Kiryu
[0:45:43] <isolex_> give him a taste of the good shit!
[0:45:43] <wired_soul> my balls ??
[0:45:44] <rufus2k2> @mcjimbo12 "Language young man, you're going in the swear jar!"
[0:45:45] <+Ssaik> MY BALLS
[0:45:47] <SsHomes> LUL
[0:45:51] <+LastHazzerd> MY B ALLS ON STREAM
[0:45:52] <SsHomes> no way LUL
[0:45:52] <PunishedRaccoon> MY BALLLLLS
[0:45:53] <+steak_bentley> i swear to god kiryu fucks in y0
[0:45:53] <Pixel_gee> MY BALLS
[0:45:55] <Tacotouchdown> @gustavozxd literally a neckbeard
[0:45:56] <+bluetocho13> thats Donte levels of air time
[0:45:57] <+eldritchbee> DId he just say "My Balls"
[0:45:57] <+BaronBattle> ZODD!? PogChamp
[0:46:01] <TakesGuts> new sound for Nero revolver is satisfying af
[0:46:05] <+GuelermeDias> B is for Balls Exposed on Stream
[0:46:07] <teflonbilly777> @ELJOVENBATALI Nero has a Devil breaker specifically to unpure Kyrie
[0:46:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> THE NEXT THING THATS GOING TO SETTLE IS Yo-MY BALLS!
[0:46:09] <+steak_bentley> kiryu hits up the phone clubs and that dude f u c k s
[0:46:09] <+hardwiredfire> For some reason this boss kind of feels like a slower Beowulf.
[0:46:23] <TrafficCohen> @steak_bentley The closest Kiryu gets to fucking in Y0 is porn VHSs
[0:46:25] <+attackofthesage> V definitely has something to do with mundus at least. Even his theme is called Crimson cloud
[0:46:26] <SsHomes> he kinda is
[0:46:26] <+GuelermeDias> kiryu doesn't fuck
[0:46:28] <gustavozxd> V's gonna grow a neckbeard by the end of the game just like Dino's hair
[0:46:30] <+GuelermeDias> he does jerk off a lot tho
[0:46:32] <SsHomes> he's a basic boss
[0:46:36] <+Ssaik> Does Gerbera's dassh have iframes?
[0:46:36] <Lion_kun> ha, you have weak tracking Goliath
[0:46:42] <+steak_bentley> doesnt he go to love hotels with girls he meets in phone clubs
[0:46:46] <PlumpPotatoRump> im suprised he does have the tracking fire pillar move Kappa
[0:46:48] <+MarshallLee67> rip
[0:46:48] <Tacotouchdown> if V says "m'lady" its over
[0:46:48] <isolex_> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:46:51] <awesomeguyrequiem> I mean beowulf is midway through 3, and this is the first boss
[0:46:53] <PlumpPotatoRump> doesnt*
[0:46:57] <alrobot2014> that berial move give me flashbacks
[0:46:58] <+superkeaton> The Hype Beam!
[0:47:11] <TrafficCohen> GO HOME AND BE A FAMILY MAN
[0:47:17] <SsHomes> this is mission 2, he's like the hell vanguard in terms of his place in the story
[0:47:23] <teflonbilly777> Pretty sure I was taken advantage of by several women as Kyrie in Yakuza 0 when I did the telephone club
[0:47:23] <isolex_> i desperately hope there will be a pc demo
[0:47:27] <rufus2k2> hope that beam shot has added lines in the full game
[0:47:29] <teflonbilly777> Kiryu
[0:47:30] <Scrub_Seeker> it's a lot more forgiving than berial's though, and with gerbera getting away from it is even easier
[0:47:30] <+megamonmon123> was it always back and y to do helm splitter?
[0:47:31] <tacostarvedbeast> mmm that hit stop, good stuff
[0:47:33] <+SodiusChubz> if v says "m'lady" im deleting it off my steam account
[0:47:36] <+Ssaik> Do the Overture counter üò°
[0:47:37] <+steak_bentley> KYRIE
[0:47:37] <iziwings> the air version of gerbera's break age seems to be really good against this dude when he's still in the building
[0:47:37] <+GuelermeDias> yeah, this is the taurus demon of dmc5
[0:47:40] <+hardwiredfire> It's the moveset. But I guess they're limited in what they can do with a guy this size.
[0:47:41] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> no
[0:47:43] <PlumpPotatoRump> @WoolieVersus have u tried destroying his tail? dunno if something extra happens
[0:47:44] <teflonbilly777> Goddammit, I'm mixing up spelling Kyrie and Kyriu
[0:47:48] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> forward is a new move for nero
[0:47:50] <Invess> parriess
[0:47:52] <Sloavon> so the eck bok is only good for demos now huh?
[0:47:52] <PhantomMaskJr> Pull my Devil Trigger cupahGasm
[0:47:53] <+steak_bentley> KYRIE IM GONNA GET US OUTTA HERE
[0:47:54] <rufus2k2> if Nero said "PROTON CANNON!" I'd lose it
[0:47:59] <tank7013> @teflonbilly777 I'm just imagining playing a Yakuza game as Kyrie now
[0:48:00] <+superkeaton> I can't wait to see the stupid shit people figure out with Breaker-less Nero.
[0:48:08] <Tacotouchdown> @sodiuschubz if V says "m'lady" you'll buy it twice
[0:48:17] <Metalchaosmaster> I wonder if there's gonna be leaderboards for this like in 4 and DmC again
[0:48:22] <itsya_boi_gappy> i should be playing other games but i keep playing this dang demo LUL
[0:48:22] <+moistermeister> You guys seen what happens when you demodularize Urizens voice from the trailer?
[0:48:23] <gustavozxd> oh no not that move
[0:48:24] <+SammyOVision> Nero Screaming "Mega Buster" will be enough for me.
[0:48:24] <+mcjimbo12> @WoolieVersus how much do you miss having snatch always?
[0:48:29] <SunsetJack> I miss able to do an epic buster move on bosses.
[0:48:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> Did that Demon...DT?!
[0:48:30] <iziwings> DAB
[0:48:32] <MonsieurCreamy> Aerial dabbing?
[0:48:34] <dukenux> @Tacotouchdown is that how he welcomes his sister?
[0:48:36] <vergil_angelo> @WoolieVersus V's demons are called Shadow, Nightmare, and Griffon, think he has anything to do with Mundus or is he just good with demons?
[0:48:38] <+superkeaton> rooDab
[0:48:38] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> you always do have snatch tho
[0:48:39] <Lion_kun> woolie do the fancy perfect counter
[0:48:42] <teflonbilly777> @tank7013 Just mod Haruka's chapter in Yakuza 5. There's a ton of singing in that
[0:48:42] <iziwings> you always do have snatch
[0:48:46] <+thezkiller175> he always has snatch even with one arm
[0:48:51] <+attackofthesage> @moistermeister I have and it's amazing
[0:48:51] <+GuelermeDias> He drops a Gargoyle Axe
[0:48:51] <PhantomMaskJr> wwtvDAB
[0:48:51] <TrafficCohen> @WoolieVersus Have you tried Overture Parries?
[0:48:53] <deviljhojho94> I love yoyu woolie
[0:48:55] <iziwings> he has snatch with one arm
[0:49:00] <iziwings> *no arms
[0:49:00] <+Floofiie> You can EX Split the fireball back at him

[0:49:43] <teflonbilly777> Get Wet? ANDREW WK CONFIRMED FOR DMCV SOUNDTRACK
[0:49:43] <Krando> @WoolieVersus do you think you'll revisit tekken after season 2 chars have been released?

[0:49:45] <gustavozxd> every time you get wet you get 50 rorbs
[0:49:47] <PhantomMaskJr> cupahGasm
[0:49:50] <Klefth> Is the timing for ex-act the same? @WoolieVersus ?
[0:49:50] <+megamonmon123> s rank screen is what you expect but its cool
[0:49:53] <+DylanHoulder> its a really lenient reflection window, Gerber dash is practically free
[0:49:56] <isolex_> DEVIL: MAY CRY IS BACK
[0:49:56] <jase__x> GO FOR THE S RANK WOOLS
[0:49:57] <+attackofthesage> And to think this is the game WITHOUT UPGRADES
[0:49:58] <Pixel_gee> IS BACK BABY

[0:50:22] <+seaearthandsky> whats up woolz
[0:50:25] <NarcissistCactus> imagine buying an xbox game
[0:50:29] <+moistermeister> @attackofthesage might not mean shit since he also voiced Credo but who knows..
[0:50:30] <+comfyman12> Level design seems great. That was my main complaint with DMC4 was that the combat was near perfection but the game was clearly unfinished
[0:50:31] <teflonbilly777> @Great_Sage Nero was always cool. Devil Bring is boss
[0:50:32] <gustavozxd> I wanna preorder for that sick ass ps4 theme
[0:50:34] <DatAsuna> If only they did a DMC game where guns do damage before this
[0:50:44] <+Great_Sage> @teflonbilly777 O he was cool, but now he's mega cool
[0:50:45] <+megamonmon123> @ahmcha same, i just hope it works fine day 1
[0:50:50] <TheFilth> Never pre-ordered a game before, but I hit that buy button as soon as it came up
[0:50:52] <+attackofthesage> @moistermeister oh I know, doesn't change the fact that it was cool as hell
[0:50:52] <SsHomes> dmc2 Kappa
[0:50:55] <TrafficCohen> @DatAsuna Shut your mouth, no DMC has strong guns
[0:50:57] <teflonbilly777> @comfyman12 Those janky ass platform sections
[0:50:58] <TrafficCohen> Kappa
[0:50:58] <Revant_tillywink> @WoolieVersus how do you feel about having to pick up arms as apposed to being able to pick them at the start of the level
[0:51:09] <gustavozxd> 1 and 3 guns are pretty great actually
[0:51:12] <DatAsuna> I really hope nero fights helicopters in this game
[0:51:20] <+megamonmon123> @datasuna you mean dmc 2?
[0:51:21] <dbgt5551> DMC5 demo video for the channel?
[0:51:23] <SsHomes> guns in 3 were pretty good with gunslinger
[0:51:27] <+Great_Sage> @gustavozxd DMC 2 has the best guns, they're so powerful :^]]]]
[0:51:31] <DaedalusKrael> SPiral in DMC3 was great
[0:51:31] <CEGold> @gustavozxd What about 2? Those guns seem pretty strong Kappa
[0:51:31] <Pixel_gee> THATS A GOOD TITLE SCREEN
[0:51:32] <theend786> @revant_tillywink You can pick your loadout at the start of a level.
[0:51:35] <TrafficCohen> @DatAsuna What about a large orangutan?
[0:51:36] <+comfyman12> DMCV part zero when?
[0:51:42] <+Great_Sage> @CEGold I did it first, aha!
[0:51:45] <+AhmCha> Think there's gonna be a V and Dante demo?
[0:51:46] <gustavozxd> SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTHS ABOUT 2
[0:51:48] <DatAsuna> You would pigeonhole yourself
[0:51:49] <+Zaku_42> @WoolieVersus Did I see a snatch alternative with Nero's new devil breaker, or am I mistaken?
[0:51:49] <+moistermeister> @WoolieVersus you seen Urizens voice demodularized?
[0:51:51] <DatAsuna> And never experiment
[0:51:58] <PhantomMaskJr> Who are you looking forward to playing the most of the 3 @woolieversus cybgDory
[0:52:01] <+megamonmon123> @ahmcha id hope so
[0:52:05] <iziwings> you can pick a few at the start in the full game but there's still ones in the level
[0:52:05] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus what about picking a selection of arms?
[0:52:13] <flagi64> Do you think we will get devil bringer style grabs with nero bosses?
[0:52:15] <CEGold> @Great_Sage Curses! I'll have it next time doodScrub
[0:52:16] <gustavozxd> or weapon switching
[0:52:20] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> but the ones you pick up in the level can be determined by your loadout
[0:52:21] <teflonbilly777> I wish you can change Devil Breakers on the fly and not being forced to self destruct them to get to the next one if you're on the one you don't want
[0:52:28] <d_wagon> You gotta work with what you have.
[0:52:33] <gameaholic42> I think that in the final game you can pick which arms CAN spawn, but I'm not 100% on that
[0:52:37] <+megamonmon123> i love overtures charged attack, especially with an group of enemies
[0:52:41] <+kraftium> what if nero just had 2 arms that you could switch instead of breaking them with break away
[0:52:42] <+megamonmon123> super stylish
[0:52:45] <Invess> risk/reward
[0:52:46] <SsHomes> devil breakers have too much utility. it would be broken to let you keep on style switching
[0:52:50] <PhantomMaskJr> shotoHado doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam wwtvPANIC
[0:52:52] <captainthunderwolf> Devil Breaker shuffling seems like an Upgrade choice later on.
[0:52:53] <+thezkiller175> they didnt want him to be like dante so thats why they dont want you swtitch arms
[0:52:57] <+mcjimbo12> Restriction breeds innovation and that's true in video games, it has been proven time and again that restricting player choice (within reason) makes the game more fun
[0:53:02] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Awesome, I came at just the right time!
[0:53:12] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Or is he done?
[0:53:13] <+SammyOVision> It also means you can subtly guide players to pick up new busters at cool times where they shine the most.
[0:53:17] <Oqzar> arm switching would add so much...
[0:53:20] <Tacotouchdown> I think you'll have your DBreakers you can choose from the start and they'll have recommended DBreakers in the level
[0:53:22] <teflonbilly777> @megamonmon123 It feels a bit too static for me when you pull out that insane beam. I wanna style around my enemies
[0:53:30] <+megamonmon123> So which is better, overture or gerbera
[0:53:30] <+Qsmash_> I'm just now realizing the logo is making wings on Nero's back.
[0:53:32] <+Great_Sage> lol
[0:53:33] <+BaronBattle> wings on his back
[0:53:35] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> rawhide makes snatch stronger yeah
[0:53:35] <+goose_attack_almanac> @MainMan_Jonadiah He just beat the demo.
[0:53:36] <teflonbilly777> @captainthunderwolf I hope so
[0:53:37] <+BaronBattle> so dope
[0:53:41] <+steak_bentley> balrog spicy tho
[0:53:45] <+commanderclaw> @WoolieVersus The Villain's voice demodulated is just Vergil's
[0:53:47] <+Shotgundam009> i hope they let switch later
[0:53:49] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @goose_attack_almanac Dang!
[0:53:51] <Nickhead93> which Xbox version is this?
[0:53:54] <ThirdStrike_Alex> wtf you talking about? his snatch is there just lock on and 'B'
[0:53:54] <PlumpPotatoRump> loool
[0:53:54] <+megamonmon123> @teflonbilly777 i said overture, the one where you shove an explosive arm into the enemy
[0:53:59] <itsya_boi_gappy> would you say dante has you the least hyped? @WoolieVersus
[0:54:00] <+thezkiller175> ome
[0:54:00] <+TQuick101> chocolate croissant..
[0:54:01] <DatAsuna> Xbone regular
[0:54:02] <+megamonmon123> then you shoot it
[0:54:03] <+AhmCha> Has anything significant changed about the original stuff Nero had in DMC4?
[0:54:06] <TrafficCohen> THIS FUCKING INTRO PIANO
[0:54:07] <tacostarvedbeast> is lady playable in this game?
[0:54:08] <+ThePaleSage> nero's opening title card remind me of Raiden in revengence
[0:54:09] <wired_soul> except on castbox
[0:54:09] <+trevin3dimensions> IS UR PODCAST A SOLO SHOW OR DO YOU HAVE GUESTS? @WoolieVersus
[0:54:11] <Saul_dlc> So happy Griffon is back!
[0:54:13] <+trevin3dimensions> oops caps
[0:54:14] <TrafficCohen> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:54:14] <+megamonmon123> @ahmcha so much
[0:54:17] <PunishedRaccoon> @WoolieVersus do you think the change to demons looks in terms of making them look grosser like in new resident evil
[0:54:18] <captainthunderwolf> @teflonbilly777 A mid-late game Upgrade or story-given ability seems like the best option, because advanced players are going to WANT the switch ability, but people need time to get accustomed to the systems.
[0:54:21] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> isn't it a marimba?
[0:54:24] <Emdhad> who do you main in smash ult? i main ike
[0:54:24] <SlashingIce> Anyone else think Itsuno will make Nero a nephilim in this game?
[0:54:25] <DatAsuna> It has guests in the second one
[0:54:26] <MelBrooksKA> I'd buy that for a dollar spyCappa
[0:54:39] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> angels don't exist in this universe
[0:54:42] <MelBrooksKA> But does Woolie figure it out?
[0:54:42] <+megamonmon123> i think i like gerbera the best so far
[0:54:43] <+thezkiller175> no lie got get use to the new camera system
[0:54:49] <+EVOriginal> @WoolieVersus <3 atpHorns
[0:54:52] <TrafficCohen> @SlashingIce There's no angels in this series, only in the reboot
[0:54:56] <etalmeta> @SlashingIce he already is by the definition of this lore
[0:54:57] <+AhmCha> God the one time I wish I had an Xbox
[0:55:03] <MelBrooksKA> And will Figure woolie out?
[0:55:05] <teflonbilly777> I LOVE AZUMANGAH DAIOH!
[0:55:09] <gustavozxd> i'm gonna use the megaman breaker only when doing heaven or hell
[0:55:14] <rufus2k2> the only "angels" are the false ones in 4, RIP Credo
[0:55:16] <+SammyOVision> Don't worry, @WoolieVersus, Tons of people upload podcasts to their channel all the time
[0:55:20] <Klefth> Is it on Google Podcasts as well?
[0:55:20] <+megamonmon123> s rank now
[0:55:20] <Emdhad> Make a cover with your own voice problem solved
[0:55:22] <teflonbilly777> @WoolieVersus Who is best Azumangah Daioh girl? My fave is Osaka
[0:55:23] <DaedalusKrael> @WoolieVersus Has there been any camera trouble?
[0:55:24] <SlashingIce> The wings in the logo are suspicious.
[0:55:27] <+mcjimbo12> @WoolieVersus how do you find the time in the day to box, stream, edit, record for the main channel and now do your own podcast, you absolute madman
[0:55:39] <PhantomMaskJr> wwtvPOWER doodDoom wwtvGLOVE
[0:55:40] <EnderGamma> I just recently sold my xb1 a month ago. How could I have known
[0:55:42] <Sloavon> hurry up and get back to fortnite
[0:55:45] <theend786> @woolieversus hey what‚Äôs cool about Gerbera‚Äôs air multi shot ray is that it‚Äôs not random. It‚Äôll direct to whoever you‚Äôre locked on to.
[0:55:48] <teflonbilly777> Yay!
[0:55:54] <isolex_> i hope we get a dante demo too
[0:55:58] <stellar_flare> Chiyo-chan's Dad is best Azumanga Daioh
[0:56:00] <TheFilth> I swear to god if Nero doesn't get a devil trigger I'm gonna angrily listen to his battle theme
[0:56:00] <honmaheadbutt> I like the idea that V is mundus
[0:56:00] <+LeonDragonheart> @WoolieVersus DMCV looks clunky and heavy, but in the best way. Does it feel that way too?
[0:56:07] <+megamonmon123> i would actually want another nero demo
[0:56:11] <zevitunez> too much dust on the xbone?
[0:56:12] <teflonbilly777> Platinum need to make an Azumangah Daioh game
[0:56:19] <CEGold> @EnderGamma There will be a multiconsole demo later, so don't fret! doodGood
[0:56:19] <captainthunderwolf> There's no reason an Angel equivalent couldn't exist in DMC, the setting has always been barely established in terms of who lives in it. I'd personally doubt typical, DmC-inspired angels would exist though.
[0:56:21] <gustavozxd> attention camera?
[0:56:22] <TrafficCohen> >auto-assist
[0:56:22] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus JAPANESE DUB :v
[0:56:30] <captainthunderwolf> But I mean, it's a game. They can write in whatever they want to.
[0:56:30] <+TheBesteban> hot
[0:56:34] <+bthevboi> lewd
[0:56:36] <+commanderclaw> I'm gonna Judgement Nut End when this game comes out
[0:56:46] <+megamonmon123> did anyone pick up the phone in this demo?
[0:56:48] <PlumpPotatoRump> kirby's alive :D
[0:56:49] <EnderGamma> @CEGold Patience is not my strongest suit xzeroRip
[0:56:51] <+comfyman12> So when the next demo comes out are you gonna put the dust back on the xbone?
[0:56:51] <Klefth> No fixed camera angles is what you mean?
[0:56:54] <jmepik> just arrived. has woolie done a lot of playing?
[0:56:55] <matheuspomp> ye
[0:56:56] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> Having angels ruins the point of 4's story tho
[0:56:56] <GohanEgret> wild to think this and bayo 3 will (likely) be in the same year
[0:56:57] <TrafficCohen> I mean, Lucia's DT was angelic looking. and theres the angelos
[0:57:01] <Gunnermaker> @captainthunderwolf Itsuno confirmed there is no heaven in the DMC world
[0:57:12] <Tacotouchdown> dang
[0:57:16] <+thatfilthyweeb> no fuck you chiyo is best azumanga daughteru and i will fight you anyone over this
[0:57:20] <captainthunderwolf> @Gunnermaker You don't need heaven for Angel expies, bruh. It's a video game.
[0:57:23] <Invess> @Gunnermaker that's harsh
[0:57:25] <TheFilth> at least it isn't as close to the character as GoW
[0:57:26] <SlashingIce> I'm just theory crafting though. They faked us out on angels in the past.
[0:57:26] <DatAsuna> Bring back lucia
[0:57:30] <DatAsuna> Or as woolie calls her
[0:57:32] <DatAsuna> Olivia
[0:57:32] <teflonbilly777> @captainthunderwolf There are several Hells though
[0:57:35] <arkv01> woolie live house tour soon GivePLZ
[0:57:37] <gustavozxd> bring back olivia
[0:57:38] <captainthunderwolf> It's a fictional setting.
[0:57:39] <Sloavon> kill lucia
[0:57:39] <+cvp5127> BUY NOW
[0:57:44] <+AhmCha> How's the difficulty compared to 4 and 3?
[0:57:47] <Invess> so people just die and burn huh
[0:57:49] <gustavozxd> he tricked me, that macho
[0:57:50] <SsHomes> lucia coming back would be sick
[0:57:51] <DatAsuna> Joke, Lucia already came back
[0:57:53] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus Japanese dub though
[0:57:53] <DatAsuna> As Mistral
[0:57:55] <TrafficCohen> This Demo is suck on easy mode
[0:57:56] <Tacotouchdown> Bring back Lucia and kill her!
[0:57:56] <PhantomMaskJr> @endergamma Microsoft knew that‚Äôs way they did it doodScrub
[0:57:56] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> you can't change the difficulty in the trailer
[0:57:59] <+megamonmon123> @woolieversus how many times have you played this demo?
[0:57:59] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> demo
[0:58:04] <jmepik> is there a PS4 demo?
[0:58:07] <Amasepyt> @WoolieVersus are you excited about the cameo system?
[0:58:10] <+comfyman12> You can use a PS4 controller on your PC
[0:58:12] <Xxbrodo_swaggins_xx> not yet
[0:58:13] <SsHomes> they must've kept it under wraps because there's almost nothing to post to that
[0:58:14] <GohanEgret> @jmepik not yet
[0:58:16] <+megamonmon123> @jmepik no
[0:58:17] <PlumpPotatoRump> i love nico
[0:58:19] <jmepik> ah

[0:58:20] <CEGold> @EnderGamma Trust me, I know your pain NotLikeThis
[0:58:23] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I thought that guitar was Django Django for half a second
[0:58:26] <DaedalusKrael> @WoolieVersus I

[0:58:30] <DaedalusKrael> oops
[0:58:30] <dukenux> Nico PogChamp
[0:58:31] <+D2_Synua> It's way more comfortable to play on a console than a PC
[0:58:32] <junipxr> can't sub to woolie? :(
[0:58:33] <Gunnermaker> @Invess Hell in DMC isn't really a place where humans are supposed to go when people die, its like how hell in DOOM is just another dimension not the afterlife
[0:58:34] <+Tearonex> !uptime
[0:58:37] <+drefizz> pc and ps4 will get a demo later
[0:58:46] <gustavozxd> pc won't get a demo
[0:58:47] <Aussie_Manny> BANG BANG BANG
[0:58:48] <Invess> ah
[0:58:50] <DatAsuna> The SE is a bad port unfortunately
[0:58:50] <+Tearonex> fuck, how long has he been going?
[0:58:54] <junipxr> this is the demo right?
[0:58:55] <Sloavon> sit on my face nico
[0:58:56] <+TQuick101> PC Mustard Race
[0:58:56] <+thezkiller175> the demo is for consoles only not for pc
[0:58:59] <DatAsuna> yeah the demo
[0:59:03] <freeman0001> BDE wools!
[0:59:06] <Invess> so people just kind of expire huh? @Gunnermaker
[0:59:07] <DaedalusKrael> @WoolieVersus you excited about the Cameo system
[0:59:15] <TheFilth> interesting that the exceed levels are actually locked by default
[0:59:17] <+MarshallLee67> DmC Cry
[0:59:17] <Aussie_Manny> CV?
[0:59:18] <teflonbilly777> @WoolieVersus Did you ever read any of those DMC light novels. I keep hearing about all this lore I've never heard of from them
[0:59:19] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Devil May Cry Cry
[0:59:21] <NarcissistCactus> devil may c
[0:59:21] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus are you doing a video on the channel in this demo?
[0:59:25] <Aussie_Manny> DmC Cry coming soon.
[0:59:26] <+Qsmash_> DMc: Cry
[0:59:26] <DatAsuna> DMCV: V trailer is fuckin' awful to search for
[0:59:26] <+megamonmon123> i hope the micro transactions in this game dont turn out to be game breaking
[0:59:30] <WotanCR> V? its 5 tho
[0:59:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Devil may cry cry
[0:59:31] <b1gboss007> devil may cry2
[0:59:31] <dukenux> How can Agnus' daughter be so cute
[0:59:31] <Gunnermaker> PC doesn't get a demo because dataminers cracked RE7 off of the demo and had basically everything about the game known well before it came out
[0:59:32] <TrafficCohen> dmC: DMC may CRY
[0:59:32] <OkamiDude15> devil may crive
[0:59:35] <masterfire23> @woolieversus have you played any smash?
[0:59:36] <+Shotgundam009> DMC Cry Devil could Cry
[0:59:36] <+AppleBasket> Woolie got the game early
[0:59:42] <b1gboss007> devil may cry¬≤
[0:59:44] <Invess> the cameo system looks cool as fuck
[0:59:44] <gustavozxd> DmC cry is what the sequel for THAT would be called
[0:59:46] <SsHomes> only up to exceed 2
[0:59:47] <Oqzar> but you get mods on pc for 4SE
[0:59:49] <DatAsuna> best thing about DMCV PC is
[0:59:54] <captainthunderwolf> @Gunnermaker Also because Microsoft probably paid them for it.
[0:59:54] <+characteraction> Are you going to let people subscribe to your twitch channel?
[0:59:54] <junipxr> @WoolieVersus you've talked about good enemy design (particularly in DMC: DMC) how do you feel about the ones in here? visually striking? fun to fight?
[0:59:54] <GohanEgret> leave the leaks to pat's couch Kappa
[0:59:56] <dukenux> Deep innnnnside... Devil May Cry Cry Cry~
[0:59:57] <DatAsuna> We'll be able to mod it to the correct Dante
[1:00:00] <Sloavon> eck bok
[1:00:04] <b1gboss007> "oh shit you can see me"
[1:00:14] <TrafficCohen> @DatAsuna I hate you
[1:00:14] <DotDusk> Fake dust D:
[1:00:14] <Sloavon> LUL
[1:00:15] <AlasterAngelo> i can't believe Woolie convinced store employees to give him DMC5 early
[1:00:18] <+thezkiller175> I mean they act like there isnt a shit one of leaks for this game before the offical reveal
[1:00:18] <OkamiDude15> NO SHUT UP ITS REAL
[1:00:19] <+DatLatinoGuy> heard about that one guy breaking NDA for Anthem Beta and his library got deleted, Woolie?
[1:00:21] <Gameslayer2> Ruined
[1:00:21] <+blazymaniac> this looks super pretty
[1:00:22] <CEGold> The dust on my xbox is real Kappa
[1:00:23] <+megamonmon123> my uncle at capcom told me that dmc5 will have dante in it
[1:00:23] <SsHomes> LUL
[1:00:23] <+Qsmash_> don't ruin the bit
[1:00:24] <+drefizz> We were lied to!
[1:00:25] <gustavozxd> my ps4 is dusty and I play it everyday
[1:00:26] <WotanCR> SCRIPTED
[1:00:28] <+LastHazzerd> was real dust, but not from da xbox
[1:00:28] <+mcjimbo12> DatLatinoGuy holy shit
[1:00:30] <TheFilth> my whole life is a lie
[1:00:30] <+cvp5127> immersion ruined
[1:00:30] <time_axis> it's real to me
[1:00:31] <stellar_flare> Woolie it's okay no need to protect Phil Spencer's feelings
[1:00:31] <Cobaltor_252> wow I can't believe they had the audacity to replace Kat in this game
[1:00:31] <freeman0001> Hey woolie seen the s rank speedruns of this demo?
[1:00:32] <TrafficCohen> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:00:33] <dukenux> Plot twist: It was grandma's ashes
[1:00:34] <teflonbilly777> @WoolieVersus Oh there's a leak alright, it's just precum from all these SICK COMBOS
[1:00:35] <Invess> @DatLatinoGuy that wasn't his whole library
[1:00:39] <+Blankets_and_Tea> i wish there was a harder difficulty mode in the demo
[1:00:39] <MSN04_Sazabi> Woolie the Liar strikes again
[1:00:40] <zevitunez> Can you do the Air Taunt?
[1:00:41] <OkamiDude15> WHY WOULD YOU BREAK KAYFABE?
[1:00:42] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Taunts with functions, so good!
[1:00:42] <Graxe_> So, you put dust on your Xbox just to blow it off.
[1:00:44] <Gunnermaker> @WoolieVersus Have you gotten the hood taunt yet?
[1:00:45] <DatAsuna> @TrafficCohen Dont√©, el exterminador de demonios
[1:00:46] <+Shotgundam009> Fake dust... where do the lies end?
[1:00:47] <+DatLatinoGuy> still funny tho lmao
[1:00:47] <Invess> it was a burner account he only had the alpha in there
[1:00:47] <Tacotouchdown> @woolieversus get Pat to get the store to give him DMCV early
[1:00:48] <+mcjimbo12> did we talk about the live devil trigger performance yet
[1:00:48] <itsya_boi_gappy> You know phil saw that tweet and was hurting woolie LUL
[1:00:51] <Prevot> faked the dust but didn't fake the garbage for the intro NotLikeThis
[1:00:52] <iziwings> can you exceed the air taunt
[1:00:54] <MZess> I knew it in my heart the dust wasn't for real, but I still didn't doubt the possibility
[1:00:57] <dukenux> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[1:00:59] <WotanCR> can u exceed while on the air taunting
[1:00:59] <Sloavon> DSP?
[1:01:02] <+megamonmon123> was that actually a taunt or just charging your shots?

[1:01:29] <MelBrooksKA> Sleeping in real garbage and covering your XBox in lint that you picked from your dryer? I think streaming is a bad influence on you Woolie... spyCappa

[1:01:38] <+MarshallLee67> Kreygasm
[1:01:38] <Finaldragoon> Woolie do you think Donguri picked up an Xbox One just to mess around in this demo?
[1:01:39] <teflonbilly777> Gerbera is the smoothers
[1:01:39] <dukenux> THAT'S RAD
[1:01:39] <+megamonmon123> use more oveture charge attacks
[1:01:40] <+DatLatinoGuy> so good
[1:01:40] <yuribo26> Capcom with money Kreygasm
[1:01:41] <Gunnermaker> @WoolieVersus Did you know you can shoot mid roll?
[1:01:41] <Angry_Ev1L> how the fuck is this allowed
[1:01:48] <+CrazyRainbows> If you told me two years ago Itsuno would literally save video games with DMC5 I never would have believed you. But here we are
[1:01:49] <AlasterAngelo> HOW MANY DO YOU GET
[1:01:49] <gustavozxd> infinite trickster
[1:01:51] <gyrobasel> THEY HAVE TO NERF THIS BEFORE RELEASE
[1:01:52] <isolex_> @Angry_Ev1L its the demo
[1:01:53] <OkamiDude15> YOU CAN JUST DO THAT INFINITLEY?!
[1:01:56] <dukenux> ITS TOO GOOD
[1:02:04] <Gunnermaker> If you get hit during it the arm breaks tho
[1:02:05] <Invess> I wonder if the alt colors have brighter blues/reds for Nero
[1:02:09] <Cobaltor_252> well time to never touch the ground ever again
[1:02:11] <DatAsuna> Git gud
[1:02:12] <+SammyOVision> you can do it so long as you don't get hit while doing it.
[1:02:12] <FeedbacK7777> @OkamiDude15 yes, you can "jockey" infinitely.
[1:02:13] <+megamonmon123> @okamidude15 it eventually breaks
[1:02:13] <DatAsuna> don't get hit
[1:02:14] <+mcjimbo12> @CrazyRainbows not only that, but yoko taro saving platinum games with giant slappable robot asses
[1:02:18] <teflonbilly777> POOR SPIDER IS JUST TRYING TO GTE HOME!
[1:02:18] <+thatfilthyweeb> you just know that woolie is constantly dancing to this song like those punk goth dudes under that bridge
[1:02:19] <b1gboss007> it should be 3 or 4 in a row max, lile bayo
[1:02:20] <gustavozxd> that full white costume for nero looks cool
[1:02:21] <Sloavon> the floor is lava
[1:02:25] <MainMan_Jonadiah> It's a single-player game! Never nerf nothin,' just keep buffin!
[1:02:27] <+CrazyRainbows> @mcjimbo12
[1:02:28] <isolex_> "Dante is strongest in the air" Nero: Hold my beer
[1:02:29] <gustavozxd> I hope we get actual costumes though
[1:02:29] <Angry_Ev1L> @isolex_ you think infinite gerbera air dodge won't be in final version?
[1:02:31] <OkamiDude15> @megamonmon123 how many till it breaks?
[1:02:35] <captainthunderwolf> Nero's cool and all, but I really do just want to see Dante kill people with his gay cowboy hat and stylish red scarf.
[1:02:42] <+Solidnick18> fireloCry
[1:02:42] <captainthunderwolf> That's what I'm personally waiting for.
[1:02:44] <+mcjimbo12> SCUM
[1:02:48] <isolex_> @Angry_Ev1L i would imagine it will be significantly harder since the demo is stuck on easy.

[1:03:23] <+LastHazzerd> have enemies ever interacted with your Rorbs before?
[1:03:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Big booty bug bitches
[1:03:27] <utterheartstrike> have you seen the guitar taunt in 5 yet ?
[1:03:28] <+superkeaton> The enemies can get huge asses? Liam can never play this game.
[1:03:29] <+megamonmon123> so you have to wait for the taunt to finish to get style it seems
[1:03:32] <Angry_Ev1L> @isolex_ harder how? not easy difficulty changes inputs? adds delays? ???
[1:03:33] <teflonbilly777> Wrong way
[1:03:33] <tank7013> In before people complain about an enemy that forces microtransactions
[1:03:35] <zevitunez> Hey!!! don't steal my RORBS!! PunOko
[1:03:40] <+CrazyRainbows> "if you buy orbs we'll give you giant asses'
[1:03:41] <SsHomes> on the right alleyway
[1:03:44] <dukenux> Someone is drawing fanart of these righnt now
[1:03:45] <isolex_> @Angry_Ev1L enemies will be more plentiful and attack faster
[1:03:47] <captainthunderwolf> Not to mention that Faust uses Red Orbs as ammo, so Red Orbs have a new level of interaction in this game.
[1:03:48] <Invess> How do you get Hoodie taunt?
[1:03:49] <TrafficCohen> This is really just London
[1:03:49] <FeedbacK7777> Can you still stinger/streak out of a platform?
[1:03:49] <iziwings> i hate that you and pat have made 'rorb' part of my vocabulary when i'm playing these games
[1:03:50] <PhantomMaskJr> Phat Demon Ass cybgButt
[1:03:50] <DaedalusKrael> I hope this game is so successful it inspires more Character action games to be made
[1:03:54] <teflonbilly777> @WoolieVersus To the right of the next Red Orb monster
[1:03:55] <dukenux> they're vore+inflation rolled rogether
[1:03:55] <+Great_Sage> lol
[1:03:57] <awesomeguyrequiem> Need a style meter for just walking around, Nero Pro Skater right here.
[1:03:58] <+attackofthesage> You just air stingered gerbera dashed and air taunted to hold air time for so long lmao thats sick
[1:03:58] <isolex_> @Angry_Ev1L If you get hit during the animation, you lose the arm. So it's way riskier
[1:03:59] <+Great_Sage> blorb is my favorite
[1:04:05] <gustavozxd> a whole lot of action games lately
[1:04:08] <yuribo26> Please run well in my pc evoMindBlown
[1:04:09] <TrafficCohen> @DaedalusKrael The dream
[1:04:14] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus So the game steals your blorbs and forces mtxs on you... I see what u doin CAPCOM
[1:04:15] <+cvp5127> cant steal rorbs from the dlc store LUL
[1:04:18] <+megamonmon123> am i wrong that you only get style when you finish your taunt?
[1:04:19] <gustavozxd> ever since nier and ffxv
[1:04:23] <Tacotouchdown> i need rorbs, porbs, blurbs, but NEVER glorbs!
[1:04:25] <+CrazyRainbows> @DaedalusKrael I hope it's successful enough to get Capcom to remaster GodHand.
[1:04:29] <+MarshallLee67> it depends on the taunt @megamonmon123
[1:04:31] <Invess> Does Dante live in europe?
[1:04:32] <AlasterAngelo> not enough people drinking tea to be Britain
[1:04:35] <Prevot> wheres the union jack patch tho
[1:04:36] <PlumpPotatoRump> the telephone boxes, red busses, london
[1:04:36] <+MarshallLee67> some have special interactions with the style meter
[1:04:38] <+LastHazzerd> times square or whatever japan's equivelant is
[1:04:41] <Angry_Ev1L> @isolex_ it literally changes nothing lmao....
[1:04:42] <+djs1312> there are places like that in london with the screens
[1:04:45] <WritebroAlpha> It actually looks like Picadilly Circus in London, not Times Square. It's closer in size to Picadilly
[1:04:46] <+SammyOVision> @WoolieVersus, you know London HAS an intersection like that, right?
[1:04:47] <NeuroHatter> Reminds me of the City in the DMC anime.
[1:04:48] <PhantomMaskJr> New London
[1:04:48] <CEGold> Also if you have the demo on your console when the game comes out, you get a free 30,000 red orbs
[1:04:52] <AlasterAngelo> @LastHazzerd I think that's Shibuya
[1:04:55] <+mcjimbo12> Redgrave City is the ruins of the city from DmC, Urizen is Vergin, screenshot this
[1:04:55] <DotDusk> Style on that THICC boy
[1:04:57] <Invess> Have these dudes been european this whole time? I feel lied to now

[1:06:31] <WritebroAlpha> Oi @WoolieVersus, I'd say those screens look closer to London's Picadilly Circus than Times Square. It's closer to the right size.

[1:07:25] <+superkeaton> Nero is at his best in the air Kappa
[1:07:26] <DatAsuna> He surreptitiously avoided saying the name of the game
[1:07:28] <ZaibatsuFan> Did he do the Cerberus charge in the air yet?
[1:07:30] <+MechaBaphomet> Not even your mom
[1:07:30] <PhantomMaskJr> @solidnick18 klinkButta luaSlap
[1:07:31] <+Remery_> He's like a angry Butterfly :)
[1:07:31] <+Ssaik> GET OUTTA MY SIGHT
[1:07:32] <+CrazyRainbows> I adore how Nero does his in-air dodges. It looks SO good
[1:07:32] <+Great_Sage> it's DmC Donte vs Nero in float olympics
[1:07:38] <teflonbilly777> @WoolieVersus Unfortunately the sealed Devil gates kinda look like the inside of goatse now. I can't unsee it and now neither can you :P
[1:07:38] <ELFucilaNeroIV> It's no Yakuza length demo, but it's pretty good nonetheless.
[1:07:39] <+SaltySombrero> Does Nero still have his ground pound combo?
[1:07:45] <cervidaequus> Dantero is best in the air
[1:07:46] <+Solidnick18> phantom FeelsGoodMan
[1:07:46] <alrobot2014> not in the demo

[1:08:04] <+Great_Sage> LOL
[1:08:04] <+steak_bentley> god blue rose might be my favorite weapon in the whole series
[1:08:09] <+comfyman12> How do you do the hoodie taunt?
[1:08:10] <ZaibatsuFan> @isolex_ Oh wait, what's the blue one?
[1:08:13] <DatAsuna> So with the arms, is this the dark souls of devil may cry?
[1:08:17] <+steak_bentley> lov a big dumb fuckoff revolver
[1:08:24] <+Great_Sage> I wonder what the vergil references are
[1:08:27] <isolex_> @ZaibatsuFan Overture. It's basically his old arm before the slicey slice
[1:08:27] <OkamiDude15> well he already said S H C U M
[1:08:29] <+DatLatinoGuy> Hoodie taunt is an unlockable, no?
[1:08:29] <teflonbilly777> WE STYLIN'!
[1:08:29] <SsHomes> PogChamp
[1:08:30] <dukenux> You mean Proud Souls?
[1:08:33] <+megamonmon123> @elfucilaneroiv i wish it was a yakuza length demo and then turned out to be the full game
[1:08:34] <tank7013> He's gonna say this may be fun to Vergil in a cutscene

[1:09:01] <Illuminatural> @WoolieVersus have you done the hoodie taunt yet?
[1:09:02] <iziwings> @WoolieVersus next time you get to the top of that building there's another secret rorb stash up there
[1:09:07] <gustavozxd> nero: "you already have an arm dad!" Vergil: "Well I want yours too"
[1:09:13] <OkamiDude15> woolie doesnt wanna fight in dmcv? fake fan Kappa

[1:09:25] <jmepik> y u m
[1:09:30] <+Great_Sage> I hope Woolie sees that lol
[1:09:32] <FeedbacK7777> it's a cache
[1:09:35] <+DatLatinoGuy> Vergil went **yoink** on Nero's arm
[1:09:41] <alrobot2014> imagine if they hid a secret mission in this demo
[1:09:41] <cherubsanonymous> Learn new things ERRYDAY
[1:09:42] <+megamonmon123> isnt dante in project x zone so nero can be smash
[1:09:46] <SsHomes> overture feels so simple in comparison to the other arms
[1:09:53] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Would you want Nero for Smash? Or Dante? ... Or V, for that matter?
[1:09:56] <+bthevboi> god i wish i had this
[1:10:00] <+megamonmon123> payphone
[1:10:02] <TrafficCohen> LADY FOR SMASH
[1:10:08] <dukenux> yeyeye
[1:10:08] <+Ssaik> DO OVERTURE COUNTER
[1:10:10] <Gunnermaker> @SsHomes It can counter bosses
[1:10:11] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Lady for Smash is the correct answer
[1:10:13] <+MarshallLee67> smash lady Kreygasm
[1:10:17] <PlumpPotatoRump> i love nico
[1:10:20] <Sloavon> What's a pay...phone?
[1:10:24] <Shiranui24> yo what if vergil made into smash instead of dante
[1:10:27] <AlasterAngelo> dude don't ignore your mistress
[1:10:27] <dukenux> I want Lady for Smash and Smash the Lady Kappa
[1:10:29] <+goose_attack_almanac> Lady is for mom
[1:10:31] <DaedalusKrael> why are there so many ARMS?
[1:10:31] <juxtest> Arkham/Jester for Smash
[1:10:32] <iziwings> i mean v apparently has a fucking parry against this dude with nightmare
[1:10:33] <+goose_attack_almanac> please
[1:10:33] <+JayEarly> I wonder if other enemy types will have some model variation like The Hells
[1:10:33] <+megamonmon123> lady would be super broken in smash
[1:10:38] <teflonbilly777> Possessed Helicopter for Smash pls
[1:10:42] <DaedalusKrael> did nico airdrop them?
[1:10:44] <fallsoff> smash the ladies of course
[1:10:44] <Invess> yeah
[1:10:46] <+Ssaik> It's cool I just like screaming bullshit <3
[1:10:48] <itsya_boi_gappy> yeah
[1:10:48] <Invess> when he tackles
[1:10:49] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yo, I'd be down for Arkham in Smash
[1:10:50] <FeedbacK7777> Yeah. when he charges at you
[1:10:52] <Shiranui24> Lady is best girl
[1:10:52] <+Ssaik> When he tackles
[1:10:55] <+jkobe34> yup when he charges at you
[1:10:57] <Ranger747> that an I think the leap
[1:11:00] <utterheartstrike> it's when he charges at you
[1:11:03] <SsHomes> you can counter the tackle and the jump
[1:11:09] <+attackofthesage> When he charges or leaps
[1:11:09] <gustavozxd> having everyone swear but dante is actually really great
[1:11:12] <Sheepeze> Just joined, he playing DMC 5 or demo?
[1:11:15] <teflonbilly777> Dem dodges
[1:11:18] <SsHomes> demo

[1:11:29] <exploitativity2> the game comes out in march
[1:11:31] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Dante is a good boy, he's not a potty mouth like everyone else
[1:11:32] <AlasterAngelo> @Sheepeze he's playing the full game he scammed some employees out of it
[1:11:33] <OkamiDude15> @Sheepeze demo. game doesnt come out for a couple of months
[1:11:35] <+attackofthesage> Pretty sure it's generous
[1:11:37] <+megamonmon123> @sheepeze he got the full game from his uncle in capcom
[1:11:43] <fairore> hey woolie
[1:11:44] <Graxe_> Didn't Overture have air and ground lightning palms too? Like Nero shoots it up or he can surge it through the ground?

[1:11:51] <d_wagon> on contact
[1:11:53] <isolex_> @Graxe_ yes

[1:11:58] <itsya_boi_gappy> when he jumps out
[1:11:58] <SsHomes> yeah you can also counter that pretty sure
[1:11:59] <FeedbacK7777> outside

[1:12:05] <gustavozxd> dante still the only character that uses Dpad
[1:12:23] <+megamonmon123> is he gonna play the demo all stream?... cause id be cool with that
[1:12:23] <teflonbilly777> @exploitativity2 Oh, you mean DEVIL TRIGGER when you unlock that later in the game
[1:12:29] <yuribo26> Damn, that attack looks cool af
[1:12:33] <iziwings> nico made an arm that eats pasta and a fucking vibrator hand but not one with a mobile phone , she said find a payphone LUL
[1:12:38] <+attackofthesage> Yeah
[1:12:43] <exploitativity2> can't wait to see what nero's (UNUSED) looks like
[1:12:49] <exploitativity2> oh god that sounds like a dick joke
[1:12:52] <SsHomes> yeah, only with overture though
[1:12:52] <Gunnermaker> Its almost certainly his devil trigger
[1:12:53] <Invess> get distance and force him to tackle
[1:12:54] <DaedalusKrael> what does the Dpad do for Nero?
[1:12:56] <joylent_blue> not gonna have access to an xbone for a couple weeks BibleThump
[1:13:00] <Inebriateddonut> So much SCUM in this game

[1:13:17] <+megamonmon123> dont forget woolie you can dodge in the air without gerbera
[1:13:21] <Gunnermaker> @WoolieVersus You need to use overture for the counter
[1:13:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Man, I just remembered there's a good chance Faust has been upgraded to straight up boss status, and I really want to see that!
[1:13:27] <+CrazyRainbows> I really dig the design of the boss lifebar.
[1:13:32] <Invess> You gotta use overture's regular attack to do it
[1:13:35] <rufus2k2> that stun state feels like you could do something there
[1:13:37] <alexshinsuke> guys what demo is this from ?
[1:13:39] <iziwings> YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING

[1:15:20] <tejediego> woolie not a game journo confirmed Kappa
[1:15:31] <Metalchaosmaster> no guys sss isnt max in the original. ss is and here it might just be s
[1:15:37] <captainthunderwolf> Eat it, it becomes your other arm now.
[1:15:39] <DXLelouch24> R2 button obviously
[1:15:39] <exploitativity2> THE DEVIL BRINGER IS NOW REMOVABLE
[1:15:40] <alrobot2014> GET TWO RIGHT HANDS
[1:15:40] <captainthunderwolf> No normal arms.
[1:15:41] <Invess> Nah that arm is just gone now
[1:15:41] <+AlwaysHuffer> naaah Nero will just get a full body mech suit in the end
[1:15:45] <exploitativity2> USE IT AS A BUSTER
[1:15:48] <Gunnermaker> @WoolieVersus The devil bringer seem straight up inferior now
[1:15:49] <DXLelouch24> nah Woolie
[1:15:49] <captainthunderwolf> YEAH, TWO RIGHT HANDS
[1:15:53] <teflonbilly777> Vergil has already turned Nero's arm into the Yamato though
[1:15:54] <DXLelouch24> the arm moves
[1:15:54] <captainthunderwolf> FUCK YOUR HUMIE LEFT HAND
[1:15:56] <DXLelouch24> get added
[1:15:57] <exploitativity2> CENTERFOLDU
[1:15:58] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus Maybe just the stand?
[1:15:58] <dukenux> @Metalchaosmaster we've seen him reachin SS
[1:15:58] <b1gboss007> nah, you already have the buster breaker
[1:15:59] <stellar_flare> Woolie, imagine if Nero's DT lets him cycle through his arms, but using their Breakers depletes your DT gauge.
[1:16:00] <jmepik> might just the bringer is destroyed
[1:16:00] <rufus2k2> nah itsuno would go ham on the devilbringer
[1:16:00] <FeedbacK7777> Biomechanical devil trigger using the arms for different designs?
[1:16:01] <DXLelouch24> ti the bringer
[1:16:01] <+KNYGHT87> doodFive
[1:16:02] <gustavozxd> the yamato buster
[1:16:04] <+mcjimbo12> Maybe getting the bringer is his DT
[1:16:04] <fattness132> make it be able to use all of the other breakers abilities
[1:16:05] <Zebylth> cut the other arm
[1:16:06] <+moranprime> @WoolieVersus Maybe it'll give Nero his DT like in the concept art for 4.
[1:16:06] <Goldenwolf98> Hes gonna get it back then mount it on his wall LUL
[1:16:07] <juxtest> Nero should graft it to the middle of his chest
[1:16:07] <Invess> I think it's just a revenge quest now @WoolieVersus
[1:16:08] <+ShadowArcangel> THAT ARM ABSORBS THE OTHER ARMS! THINK ABOUT IT!
[1:16:08] <Oqzar> I dont think he's getting it back
[1:16:09] <Inebriateddonut> Maybe Devil Bringer just combines all the arms?
[1:16:10] <gustavozxd> yamato breaker i mean
[1:16:13] <DigTheSquig> Full DT unlock moon2C
[1:16:17] <pragmaticdissent> They'll probably include the same moves from the robot arm but buffed with some extra moves.
[1:16:19] <exploitativity2> bro what is an xbox
[1:16:19] <NeonBleu> Summon Fingers would make it op
[1:16:20] <Pixel_gee> Nero seems to want revenge on vergil for taking the arm but the trailers seem to show the plot is all about stopping the new big bad
[1:16:21] <DatAsuna> He doesn't necessarily have to get it back
[1:16:22] <dukenux> so my bet is SSS being the highest rank, just like in all games past 2
[1:16:23] <DaedalusKrael> I don't think he will get the bringer back
[1:16:26] <Rngiddion> Maybe the Devil Bringer absorbs all of Nicos arms?
[1:16:28] <+DylanHoulder> hopefully to switch between them all
[1:16:28] <+attackofthesage> He gets it and duel wields Yamato with Red Queen lol
[1:16:31] <b1gboss007> his devil trigger will probably be the devil bringger
[1:16:32] <Rngiddion> so he keeps the mechanics
[1:16:35] <skitzless> Is this demo limited time only?
[1:16:37] <gustavozxd> @dukenux nah SSS is just DmC
[1:16:39] <TrafficCohen> @exploitativity2 A MDC demo machine
[1:16:41] <+Ssaik> monkaS
[1:16:42] <JoeNeutrino> I don't think he'll ever get his original arm back but he will gain the ability to devil trigger.
[1:16:43] <Metalchaosmaster> so ye ss. you get ss if you have basically a perfect run
[1:16:45] <retrokid616> hey every............OMFG YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES DMC IS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:16:45] <converterv2> Doncic!! woolie im soo happy right now
[1:16:49] <+sanstus2> @WoolieVersus Inb4 you just absorb it into yourself to get your Devil Trigger again.
[1:16:52] <DXLelouch24> REMEMBER, in 4 devil bringer absorbs stuff from other things, could happen with the arms
[1:16:52] <go4thekneez> I dont get why you cant switch between your stock arms
[1:16:53] <kouhi12> unless you tie it to his DT and he keeps the busters while not in DT @WoolieVersus
[1:16:57] <TrafficCohen> GUITAR Kreygasm
[1:16:59] <joylent_blue> skitzless i heard its available until january
[1:16:59] <+mcjimbo12> Nero has to have a DT of some kind right so it's probably just coming from getting devil bringer back
[1:17:01] <+megamonmon123> you can still dodge in the air
[1:17:02] <DatAsuna> March is so far away @_@
[1:17:04] <honmaheadbutt> Nero‚Äôs DT is he has three arms would be rad
[1:17:04] <dukenux> @gustavozxd oh, he meant the general rank after beating the mission? my bad then
[1:17:07] <DaedalusKrael> what if his left hand turns into the devil Bringer?
[1:17:07] <SirAlan76> or his old devil bringer becomes all of them in one in some way
[1:17:10] <captainthunderwolf> It'd be cool if he had a DT'd out Master Arm that has a weaker version of ALL of the other Arms' functions, which could remain balanced but keep the linear shuffling system the arms have right now,
[1:17:14] <+megamonmon123> you can dodge in the air without gerbera @woolieversus
[1:17:17] <zevitunez> What if, his devil trigger is his old arm?
[1:17:23] <+CrazyRainbows> I feel like IF he gets the arm back it's going to be the catalyst for a proper DT rather than just the arm being OP as hell. like all the power gets evenly dispersed to give him a full DT.
[1:17:37] <DXLelouch24> after Nero gets his arm back, you unlock the other arms as style with the direction buttons
[1:17:39] <dukenux> BLAST
[1:17:43] <ELFucilaNeroIV> What does the Buster arm breakerage do?
[1:17:44] <damienlunas> Holy crap what is this quality
[1:17:44] <DXLelouch24> earn your OP ness
[1:17:45] <captainthunderwolf> And that'd be, of course, his end-game Demon Arm.
[1:17:47] <brambobelurkin> ITS LOOK SO CLEAN
[1:17:53] <Angry_Ev1L> I want his old costume as a bonus unlock and STANDO POWER DT goddamnit
[1:17:53] <etalmeta> maybe he doesn't get ht arm but just yamato
[1:17:53] <+megamonmon123> @zevitunez right now dt is now breakaway and burning an arm for a super attack
[1:17:55] <ContentNotFound> PogChamp
[1:18:00] <Them00n> !uptime
[1:18:02] <fallsoff> yeah not dirty at all
[1:18:02] <MSN04_Sazabi> I dunno, for whatever reason I think that a conventional Dante/Vergil-like DT form doesn't really suit Nero
[1:18:03] <gustavozxd> @zevitunez that's what i'm expecting, hopefuly we'll get a real demon form DT this time
[1:18:04] <yuribo26> SourPls
[1:18:09] <+Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:18:11] <exploitativity2> FRUSTRATION IS GETTIN BIGGER
[1:18:13] <dukenux> My god, i hear Nero screams, and im just remind of Dino's "heeeauuuuuuuuughhs" in DmC LUL
[1:18:14] <joylent_blue> SourPls
[1:18:15] <DotDusk> SourPls
[1:18:22] <dukenux> and how this is so much better
[1:18:24] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Finish in time with the music, very nice
[1:18:26] <exploitativity2> @dukenux HURRNGH
[1:18:27] <DXLelouch24> SAZABI we gto an unused DT concept that looks sick and needs to be used
[1:18:27] <pragmaticdissent> BOO THIS ISN'T SUBHUMAN PLAYING
[1:18:30] <DXLelouch24> you go sit in the corner
[1:18:36] <+thezkiller175> seems overtune does more damage in the enemies in the air
[1:18:41] <gustavozxd> we need og subhuman Kappa
[1:18:48] <dukenux> how about
[1:18:54] <exploitativity2> wait why are there just busters lying around
[1:18:58] <HyperBomb21> So what's the deal with the music? The higher your rank, the louder the vocals?
[1:18:59] <fallsoff> subhuman "i am a vegan!"
[1:18:59] <exploitativity2> aren't they expensive
[1:19:02] <TrafficCohen> Oh, Mansion-kun
[1:19:03] <captainthunderwolf> @exploitativity2 Shhhhhh
[1:19:05] <+steak_bentley> does gerbera do anything on the ground
[1:19:05] <joylent_blue> HyperBomb21 basically yeah
[1:19:08] <dukenux> OG subhuman when you're ranking D, then the new lyrics kick in once you reach S
[1:19:10] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Capcom has been using beta concepts for RE2 Remake. So what if the Devil Bringer gives you the cut full DT?
[1:19:13] <+sanstus2> @WoolieVersus So you want to know what's inside the residence of evil??
[1:19:13] <pragmaticdissent> The fans have spoken. They want a soundtrack that's only Subhuman.
[1:19:16] <exploitativity2> @HyperBomb21 it's just different parts of the song, higher ranks include vocals
[1:19:24] <Soapydishwater> I think that its goofy as fuck the arms are just laying around yeah
[1:19:24] <Who_lio42> no woolie, theres not enough level, theres NEVER enough level
[1:19:27] <yuribo26> @HyperBomb21 rank actually unlocks tracks and elements of the song
[1:19:28] <Metalchaosmaster> run ded
[1:19:29] <Them00n> Okay chat, you get to replace subhuman with a new song, but it has to be the same genre of music, which song do you pick?
[1:19:32] <etalmeta> @steak_bentley same thing as the air version
[1:19:34] <gustavozxd> I wish they just left the pure instrumental version of subhuman
[1:19:34] <HyperBomb21> Oh sick
[1:19:37] <DatAsuna> Then you hit SSS and it switches to lilVmills versions
[1:19:40] <DXLelouch24> Armaggedon
[1:19:44] <exploitativity2> SORRY NICO
[1:19:47] <gustavozxd> oh god he heals
[1:19:50] <exploitativity2> I BROKE THE THING
[1:19:51] <gustavozxd> that's cool
[1:19:56] <captainthunderwolf> My preference for his DT really would be to get the Samurai back and double up his hits, even without the Arm, and to keep his current Devil Breaker system without either replacing the other.
[1:19:56] <Worldbrand> god damn i am impressed by the cdamera i'm seeing
[1:19:58] <+CrazyRainbows> I can't wait to swap out Subhuman with Lock&Load
[1:20:01] <dukenux> Don't be mad, Nico BibleThump
[1:20:01] <SsHomes> they have armor on the charge that's nice
[1:20:03] <Coffee_JD> haha, its like a monster hunter vigorwasp
[1:20:08] <retrokid616> is this a review copy or is it legit out
[1:20:09] <captainthunderwolf> Layering the systems feels more organic than integrating them at this point,
[1:20:11] <exploitativity2> is this the best the camera has been
[1:20:11] <DatAsuna> yeah music mos for the PC wil be a must
[1:20:13] <DatAsuna> Luckily
[1:20:18] <DatAsuna> The engine is already wide open
[1:20:18] <MSN04_Sazabi> It's a demo
[1:20:18] <joylent_blue> i like the distortion effect on streak now
[1:20:18] <TrafficCohen> @retrokid616 Xbox only demo
[1:20:22] <exploitativity2> @retrokid616 demo, game comes out march
[1:20:24] <Who_lio42> so the Arms just break from general use?
[1:20:24] <DXLelouch24> wolf just have Devil Bringer absorb the other arms as styles
[1:20:24] <zevitunez> well, IT WILL SURPASS ALL OUR ESPECTATIONS
[1:20:26] <SsHomes> no this is just the ekbok demo
[1:20:26] <DatAsuna> and modding RE7 is just as easy as modding DMC4 .etc
[1:20:31] <DaedalusKrael> @Them00n Blind guardian battlefield
[1:20:32] <DXLelouch24> then you keep everything
[1:20:33] <retrokid616> oh okay thanks chat
[1:20:35] <DedlokPM> @retrokid616 demo that is only n xbone
[1:20:36] <+attackofthesage> I miss wild stomp
[1:20:36] <DXLelouch24> and Nice gets a break
[1:20:36] <pragmaticdissent> @Them00n Same genre as in metal or same genre as in Deathcore?
[1:20:37] <DatAsuna> So this si likely to be easy mods Day 1
[1:20:37] <Inebriateddonut> So how much easier is enemy step here?
[1:20:41] <DXLelouch24> Nico*
[1:20:42] <+sanstus2> yo what
[1:20:43] <go4thekneez> I feel like I'm just going to use Gerbera the whole game it feels too good
[1:20:44] <yuribo26> SPEEDRUN PogChamp
[1:20:48] <ContentNotFound> HOLY WTF
[1:20:49] <gustavozxd> no this game won't surpass expectations, it will EXCEED expectations
[1:20:49] <+sanstus2> what the hell
[1:20:50] <GohanEgret> I keep expecting to see a KH treasure chest up there
[1:20:51] <+steak_bentley> no enemy step in the demo
[1:20:52] <FeedbacK7777> Cache on the goop
[1:20:53] <+CrazyRainbows> No enemy step in the demo
[1:20:54] <Invess> it was right there
[1:20:55] <d_wagon> puddle
[1:20:56] <SsHomes> where is it?
[1:21:01] <FeedbacK7777> in the goop puddle thing
[1:21:04] <iziwings> the puddle on the other side
[1:21:08] <gustavozxd> all these bug looking enemies
[1:21:08] <retrokid616> wait can woolie speedrun the demo
[1:21:09] <itsya_boi_gappy> @WoolieVersus stand on puddle
[1:21:10] <MainMan_Jonadiah> The red orbs were inside you all along @WoolieVersus
[1:21:13] <Invess> stand on the goop
[1:21:16] <d_wagon> in the puddle
[1:21:19] <Inebriateddonut> Dangit no enemy step
[1:21:23] <+Ms_NoOne> down I the courtyard
[1:21:24] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Chat, what band do you think would make music fit for Dante?
[1:21:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> The red orbs were the friends we made along the way @WoolieVersus
[1:21:27] <captainthunderwolf> @DXLelouch24 I really don't mind that idea either, but Nero's 'version' of DT where he gets a Stand to double-up his moves is easily one of the dopest things about him - so I'm happy as long as Yamato Dad comes back.
[1:21:29] <+D2_Synua> Language Woolie, I thought this was a christian stream
[1:21:31] <DatAsuna> One thing I could have done with more of is the level changing and shifting as you go through it tho.
[1:21:33] <Worldbrand> aaah
[1:21:35] <SsHomes> lol
[1:21:37] <damienlunas> Every time I see Gerbera I can only think of the Gerbera Tetra from Gundam Stardust Memory
[1:21:48] <DXLelouch24> he could still have that, but its an unlockable
[1:21:49] <DedlokPM> @D2_Synua You don kno whatchu messin wit
[1:21:49] <+Solidnick18> very sneaky rorbs
[1:21:52] <DXLelouch24> upgrade
[1:21:52] <DatAsuna> Speaking of which someone legit asked me the other day if Woolie was mormon. LOL
[1:21:55] <Angry_Ev1L> @damienlunas it is a gundam reference yes
[1:21:55] <yuribo26> @damienlunas I think its an actual reference
[1:21:56] <DXLelouch24> instead of burst
[1:21:56] <dukenux> Cuhrazy
[1:21:59] <DXLelouch24> he gets a stand
[1:22:00] <exploitativity2> wtf was that
[1:22:03] <FenixSeraph> @damienlunas Same thing
[1:22:04] <skykingcrow> That Nero emblem on the pause menu is cool
[1:22:05] <teflonbilly777> @DatAsuna And it should say stuff like KILL TEH BITCH and FUCK YOU DANTE on the walls
[1:22:10] <foreverN2dust> DMC5?!?
[1:22:15] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Wait, Woolie's NOT a mormon?!
[1:22:16] <DaedalusKrael> @WoolieVersus is Rorb percenatage still affect ranking?
[1:22:18] <gustavozxd> ewlords
[1:22:22] <DXLelouch24> hes christan
[1:22:22] <dukenux> Demo May Cry
[1:22:24] <yuribo26> @foreverN2dust don't tell anyone, woolie is leaking it Kappa
[1:22:26] <DatAsuna> Former Seventh Day Adventist, iirc
[1:22:29] <DXLelouch24> someone didnt watch the binding of isaac vid
[1:22:29] <+VietcongSamurai> It's nice to see the drop kick again lol.
[1:22:30] <+abadbadman> hi Woolz hows the feel of DMC5?
[1:22:31] <joylent_blue> DaedalusKrael doesn't seem like it no
[1:22:36] <exploitativity2> ayyyyyy
[1:22:37] <DatAsuna> Not completely sure tho
[1:22:37] <+trnzero> A?
[1:22:38] <Inebriateddonut> ayyyy

[1:22:41] <yuribo26> AY AY AY AY AY AY
[1:22:46] <JoeNeutrino> Oh god it's the FF15 problem
[1:22:46] <+Solidnick18> it is nero
[1:22:47] <OkamiDude15> woolie got dmcc from his uncle who works at nintendo octoDab
[1:22:47] <dukenux> yeah, if this gets out of this chat, he getsstruck like that Anthem leaker Kappa
[1:22:48] <RunningNGunning> Look at that FF15 right there
[1:22:50] <DatAsuna> Their deal is church on saturday
[1:22:51] <DaedalusKrael> @joylent_blue thank fucking god
[1:22:54] <+cvp5127> oh god its ff15 again
[1:22:55] <gustavozxd> did woolie try out the weeb dub
[1:23:06] <Inebriateddonut> Only one minute. Nico works fast
[1:23:11] <gustavozxd> dante yelling SWORDMASTA
[1:23:12] <captainthunderwolf> @WoolieVersus Long enough to necessitate Nico making him a vibrator arm for his wife, mind you.
[1:23:15] <FeedbacK7777> Can i rebind evey button like in dmc4?
[1:23:17] <Angry_Ev1L> @damienlunas I think deluxe edition bonus is special gerbera hand called gp-03
[1:23:25] <pectusumbra> Has woolie shown any V gameplay yet?
[1:23:25] <+trainer_pat> Oh shit. When the hell did this come out?
[1:23:27] <exploitativity2> which games had japanese dubs even?
[1:23:28] <DedlokPM> @OkamiDude15 apatDab rooDab
[1:23:31] <DatAsuna> Can you tell Itsuno made Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen as well?
[1:23:33] <DaedalusKrael> @gustavozxd english is canon
[1:23:33] <TalisKanju> Holy crap, Woolie is STREAMING now?! (As in, today.)
[1:23:38] <damienlunas> Is this a Taurus Demon
[1:23:39] <+sanstus2> Prrrobably about a month? Enough time for Nico to take measurements and construct some shit.
[1:23:39] <+Qsmash_> what does Overture do again?
[1:23:39] <exploitativity2> @trainer_pat demo, comes out march
[1:23:50] <itsya_boi_gappy> @exploitativity2 dmc 4 and this game
[1:23:50] <LeSypher> pretty quiet overall volume
[1:23:51] <iziwings> is the window for table hopper bigger or something
[1:23:53] <DatAsuna> Luckily Goliath doesn't have that BS portal move Daimon has
[1:23:56] <+rangriz> JUST LIKE DARK SOULS
[1:23:57] <exploitativity2> so english is SUPER CANON
[1:23:57] <+trainer_pat> @exploitativity2 Are demo's making a comeback?
[1:24:00] <+steak_bentley> rolly polly soulsy
[1:24:02] <+sanstus2> Overture is the electric hand arm @Qsmash_
[1:24:03] <Inebriateddonut> IS THIS THE DARK SOULS OF CHARACTER ACTION?
[1:24:04] <OkamiDude15> @DedlokPM woopsDab
[1:24:04] <+abadbadman> need to do a plunging attack
[1:24:05] <pragmaticdissent> It looks a little bit Soulsy seeing it like this
[1:24:06] <teflonbilly777> POKE EM IN THE BUTT! The true Dark Souls way
[1:24:06] <artoflec> i prefer to think of it as the witcher problem because you always light candles instead of interacting with the thing you want
[1:24:07] <AlasterAngelo> wow it's the darks souls of devil may cry
[1:24:08] <DatAsuna> Demo's are super not makin a comeback
[1:24:10] <FeedbacK7777> V looks exactly like Valmiro and one of his summons look like a Metal Golem from Dragon's dogma
[1:24:11] <+megamonmon123> @woolieversus you can still dodge in the air
[1:24:11] <+MarshallLee67> devil may cry 5 is the dark souls of devil may cry
[1:24:13] <gustavozxd> @DaedalusKrael I liked the jp dub though, I'm totally gonna turn it on sometimes
[1:24:17] <FuqBoiSlim> wooooow the dark souls of action games huh?
[1:24:18] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus well you're more human now
[1:24:19] <exploitativity2> @trainer_pat i couldn't tell you, but i'm happy this exists, though I don't have an xbox(it's xbone exclusive)
[1:24:23] <dukenux> And yes
[1:24:25] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Devil May Cry is the Souls of Dark gaming. :)
[1:24:28] <dukenux> This IS Anor Londo
[1:24:32] <dukenux> of DMC locations
[1:24:38] <b1gboss007> B E G O N E
[1:24:48] <+megamonmon123> i see no parries
[1:24:49] <Graxe_> This part of the fight is basically Asylum Demon, but without the big club.
[1:24:50] <Inebriateddonut> Fighting Anor Londo right now
[1:24:50] <WritebroAlpha> DMCV will fill your Dark Souls with LIGHT
[1:24:50] <joylent_blue> there will be a ps4 demo at some point, but apparently no PC demo
[1:24:50] <+trainer_pat> @exploitativity2 That's odd since this feels like more of a PS game.
[1:24:51] <teflonbilly777> That ass isn't as juicy as the Straga Demon
[1:24:52] <+abadbadman> WUT RINGS U GOT BTCH

[1:25:31] <exploitativity2> @trainer_pat i think they made a deal with microsoft, but yeah DMC is historically PS like a lot of japanese franchises
[1:25:35] <iziwings> lads you can probably buster him during the tackle in the full game

[1:26:11] <ELJOVENBATALI> THIS PARTY'S GETTIN CUH-RAZY
[1:26:12] <+trainer_pat> @exploitativity2 Makes sense.
[1:26:13] <pragmaticdissent> I just realized someone said this is Xbox One exclusive. Going to the store right fucking now.
[1:26:13] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Woolie's REALLY feeling it! LUL
[1:26:15] <gustavozxd> tracking is this DmC
[1:26:16] <alrobot2014> i think you can counter the overheads too
[1:26:17] <FuqBoiSlim> this man came live on twitch
[1:26:17] <LeSypher> ;:ez
[1:26:18] <+megamonmon123> guys cant you still dodge in the air without gerbera?
[1:26:20] <LeSypher> ez
[1:26:21] <dukenux> Oh shit, he's feeling it!
[1:26:22] <itsya_boi_gappy> when he does that slam down you can shock arm him
[1:26:27] <+sanstus2> Hmmm
[1:26:27] <exploitativity2> @pragmaticdissent dude it's a demo calm down
[1:26:29] <DingusMcBaseball> huh..
[1:26:31] <gustavozxd> that is just devil may cry shit
[1:26:35] <time_axis> what's the meter on the lock-on icon for?
[1:26:36] <captainthunderwolf> It's probably an extremely calculated move that the demo boss feels Souls-y in a game that Capcom wants to see achieve mainstream success.
[1:26:38] <go4thekneez> @megamonmon123 no
[1:26:38] <+sanstus2> Phrasing, Woolie.
[1:26:39] <Shiranui24> ew
[1:26:39] <SsHomes> you can use calibur or air hike but that's it
[1:26:41] <+JayEarly> WOOO
[1:26:43] <LeSypher> :ez:
[1:26:44] <+rangriz> LUL
[1:26:48] <OkamiDude15> does nero's back forward still have i frames? woopsHyper
[1:26:48] <gustavozxd> fruit?
[1:26:54] <SsHomes> he's throwing everything
[1:26:55] <LeSypher> :e z:
[1:26:55] <joylent_blue> ITS OK, JUST TESTING SHIT OUT
[1:26:58] <Metalchaosmaster> Is the y pause y y y y etc still in the game?
[1:27:00] <AlasterAngelo> apatLiz
[1:27:01] <+MeanGeneTheGodHand> The beam is even called the Stamen Beam. It is indeed a Gundamu reference.
[1:27:01] <alrobot2014> @OkamiDude15 can't tell its not in the demo
[1:27:02] <+DylanHoulder> gerbera dash will reflect the cars and the fireaballs
[1:27:08] <pragmaticdissent> @exploitativity2 Its a DMC5 demo. Why would you ever want to dehype this?
[1:27:09] <GohanEgret> wrap it up, b
[1:27:09] <gustavozxd> fruit of grisaia perhaps
[1:27:10] <fallsoff> just like devil may cry
[1:27:11] <+thezkiller175> https://clips.twitch.tv/PopularFastAnteaterEleGiggle
[1:27:12] <alrobot2014> @OkamiDude15 or are you talking in air?
[1:27:17] <+Ssaik> Please wrap it up
[1:27:18] <+JayEarly> @captainthunderwolf weird to see Souls considered "mainstream"
[1:27:18] <+megamonmon123> @go4thekneez i distinctly remember still dodging in the air similarly to on the grounds
[1:27:19] <mechahendrix> I like this guys mouth belly
[1:27:22] <exploitativity2> @pragmaticdissent but is it worth the pain of owning an xbone
[1:27:25] <OkamiDude15> @alrobot2014 woopsD for real? the ground one
[1:27:36] <exploitativity2> we've waited so long anyhow
[1:27:37] <DaedalusKrael> what would goliath be as a devil arm?
[1:27:37] <SsHomes> @time_axis enemy health so you don't have to look at the bottom of the screen
[1:27:46] <artoflec> he reminds me of the dragons dogma bitterblack isle boss artofl1Hmm
[1:27:49] <alrobot2014> @OkamiDude15 the ground one ( combo D) isn't in the demo
[1:27:50] <gustavozxd> at least that explosion is not almost instant
[1:27:50] <exploitativity2> oof
[1:27:50] <time_axis> @ssHomes ah, it didnt seem to match up
[1:27:58] <pragmaticdissent> I meant the Xbone store. Not to go buy a new console.
[1:27:59] <teflonbilly777> I wonder if you can do the grab on Goliath from the trailer
[1:28:00] <SsHomes> it's weird sometimes
[1:28:03] <alrobot2014> @OkamiDude15 only a and c are in the demo
[1:28:04] <captainthunderwolf> @JayEarly Maybe as of a few years ago, but as far as the "gamer" market is considered, that's peak mainstream.
[1:28:04] <go4thekneez> @megamonmon123 nah you only have air hike without gerbera
[1:28:07] <gustavozxd> is devil may cry back or what goddamn it
[1:28:10] <yuribo26> A? FAKE FAN LUL
[1:28:12] <+megamonmon123> @deaconbluesclues spikey dildo arm
[1:28:19] <exploitativity2> DMC IS BACK
[1:28:22] <joylent_blue> WOOLIE THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
[1:28:24] <exploitativity2> @pragmaticdissent ohhhh
[1:28:32] <Metalchaosmaster> 4 is the first game
[1:28:38] <+abadbadman> Does it feel a lot like 4?
[1:28:40] <+DeaconBluesClues> @megamonmon123 wrong guy I rthink
[1:28:47] <pragmaticdissent> @exploitativity2 Yeah I get why you said calm down now.
[1:28:48] <damienlunas> @WoolieVersus Are you going to stream the new Kirby game
[1:28:50] <rainsh0wsm3rcy> Hello Woolie and chat :)
[1:28:51] <itsya_boi_gappy> @WoolieVersus you can shock arm counter him when he slams on the ground with his 2 fists
[1:28:56] <SsHomes> reminda me of the different blade mode executions of raiden
[1:28:59] <+EySoyCoco> so you can play 4 without playing the others?
[1:29:01] <damienlunas> The one where all his friends are dead
[1:29:02] <+Genuine_Jew> Gerbera reflects his projectiles
[1:29:04] <gustavozxd> all the arms are godlike tbh
[1:29:04] <joylent_blue> i feel like when i get my hands on this i'm gonna fuckin cry
[1:29:06] <GohanEgret> [HMMM intesifies]
[1:29:07] <WotanCR> royal guard
[1:29:08] <+megamonmon123> @deaconbluesclues damn it my bad
[1:29:09] <TrafficCohen> AND THERES ^ MORE
[1:29:10] <yuribo26> @EySoyCoco you can
[1:29:11] <TrafficCohen> 6
[1:29:13] <exploitativity2> @pragmaticdissent bro i thought you were gonna drop 3 hundos on a demo
[1:29:13] <+trainer_pat> Wooooooolie!
[1:29:13] <gameaholic42> One weird trick lol
[1:29:14] <captainthunderwolf> @EySoyCoco You can, but you want to play 3.
[1:29:20] <+megamonmon123> do the special moves of oveture
[1:29:22] <gustavozxd> the sword upgrade arm is one that sounds really sick
[1:29:26] <+EySoyCoco> thx guys
[1:29:27] <Metalchaosmaster> do the y pause y y etc move. the smash the ground one
[1:29:29] <alrobot2014> i only found out yesterday on dmd that the she viper could get devil bringer'd when she's shitting out babies @WoolieVersus
[1:29:29] <gameaholic42> bosses HATE it
[1:29:33] <+megamonmon123> overtures charge attack is awesome
[1:29:34] <SsHomes> parry prince Kappa
[1:29:35] <+Solidnick18> overture got some stuff
[1:29:37] <+Ssaik> Ty for strimming @WoolieVersus <3
[1:29:39] <pragmaticdissent> @exploitativity2 No, definitely not. I love DMC but not even close to that much.
[1:29:40] <exploitativity2> bosses hate this one weird trick
[1:29:42] <alrobot2014> i then immediately got shat on
[1:29:44] <gustavozxd> just turn red queen into a crazy flaming heavy sword
[1:29:47] <Amasepyt> overture's break age seems very good
[1:29:53] <d_wagon> Red Queen's launcher reflects the fireball too
[1:30:05] <scrubviewer> i guess the arm shit is strategic
[1:30:09] <FeedbacK7777> Any sword red queen atk does
[1:30:16] <+Genuine_Jew> Gerbera reflects his fireballs
[1:30:20] <captainthunderwolf> @EySoyCoco No probs. BTW, the only games to avoid are DMC2 and arguably DmC: Devil May Cry, every other entry is damn solid. DMC1 feels a bit primitive now, but it holds up alright.
[1:30:21] <itsya_boi_gappy> im so happy they dropped this
[1:30:28] <SatireLegend> woooooolie!!!!
[1:30:29] <TrafficCohen> PIANO Kreygasm
[1:30:30] <joylent_blue> can we just stay up all night playing this
[1:30:33] <joylent_blue> please
[1:30:34] <+megamonmon123> so whats better, the arm switching or style switching?
[1:30:34] <FeedbacK7777> Gerbera also counters projectile
[1:30:34] <yuribo26> Hey Woolie, what is the illustration on your shirt?
[1:30:37] <OkamiDude15> woolie did you buy dante's jacket yet? Kappa
[1:30:41] <pragmaticdissent> Still don't quite like Nero's robo arm design. I don't hate it. But I don't love it the way I think I should.
[1:30:42] <+kinggooglyeyes> hello
[1:31:03] <+comfyman12> Is it Overture where Nero's fingers are bullets?
[1:31:09] <captainthunderwolf> @pragmaticdissent Likewise actually, but I think mechanically it's an awesome idea.
[1:31:10] <Angry_Ev1L> donate for woolie's nero jacket LUL
[1:31:16] <SsHomes> nothing i'm aware of
[1:31:18] <yuribo26> PogChamp
[1:31:20] <+megamonmon123> @pragmaticdissent have you seen all the arms?
[1:31:22] <Graxe_> You can try to treat Overture as Royal Guard and see what happens.

[1:31:40] <pragmaticdissent> @captainthunderwolf Yeah I think I'm going to love how it plays a loooot.
[1:31:48] <scrubviewer> @woolieversus can show off any grappel moves on the enemies
[1:31:51] <d_wagon> I know you can pull red bugs when in air
[1:31:51] <tacostarvedbeast> man i love D4Cs desing, cant wait for steel ball run
[1:31:54] <PlumpPotatoRump> i love this loading screen music omg
[1:31:58] <sii_4> irc there was a comand grab with overture

[1:32:02] <FenixSeraph> Yoshikage KYRIEEEEEEEEE
[1:32:04] <mardenombres> How many sand did you took out of the xbox?
[1:32:07] <Klefth> That tie is sick
[1:32:11] <captainthunderwolf> @pragmaticdissent Nothing like having an exploding Royalguard hand and a jet booster that turns into a Gundam death beam.
[1:32:15] <dukenux> Would Kira be into robot hands?
[1:32:17] <SsHomes> breakage is the bomb grab
[1:32:24] <GohanEgret> oh, that shirt is on shark robot, neat
[1:32:26] <shamuzu> @WoolieVersus speaking of jojo thoughts on the new episode?
[1:32:27] <FenixSeraph> Kira commissions a bunch of hands from Nico
[1:32:28] <MelBrooksKA> Don't forget the Star Platinum face mask spyCappa
[1:32:29] <yuribo26> I feel your weight struggle FeelsBadMan
[1:32:33] <pragmaticdissent> @megamonmon123 I have not. @fairore I like the hand part but the rest is just kind of...,meh. Its DMC. I want over the top style. Maybe I need to look at the other arm designs
[1:32:39] <+kevinkevinson1> WOOLIEEEEEE
[1:32:43] <ghostravens> so you're saying that you want to slim down so you can BE a Jojo?
[1:32:44] <OkamiDude15> remember that time woolie became a kamen rider? i member
[1:32:44] <+megamonmon123> @shamuzu id be surprised if he didnt like it
[1:32:47] <WritebroAlpha> Mental image of Woolie climbing a mountain only to be greeted at the peak by the Pillar Men dressed in JoJo boxers.
[1:32:53] <yuribo26> I'm losing weight again to go back to my old shirt collection
[1:33:05] <yuribo26> @WritebroAlpha thank you for that
[1:33:14] <MelBrooksKA> @WritebroAlpha Ayyyayaya
[1:33:15] <Klefth> How long do you guys think til we can sub, btw?
[1:33:16] <fairore> @pragmaticdissent i get you
[1:33:18] <PlumpPotatoRump> @yuribo26 hell yh dude!!
[1:33:19] <+abadbadman> pepeD
[1:33:22] <FenixSeraph> Can't wit to see Woolie dressed as Pucci
[1:33:26] <+Ssaik> big rorb bois
[1:33:27] <teflonbilly777> BIG RED BOOTYS
[1:33:27] <captainthunderwolf> Ironically, enemies rising from bubbling blood in the floor feels a lot more organic in DMC than it did in The Evil Within.
[1:33:29] <scrubviewer> that taunt Kreygasm
[1:33:36] <itsya_boi_gappy> yo you keeping up with part 8 as of late woolz?
[1:33:37] <Them00n> How many times has Woolie played the demo?
[1:33:46] <WritebroAlpha> @yuribo26 Dude same, losing weight for the sake of shirts that don't fit me any more but could maybe do so again!
[1:33:46] <Illuminatural> @WoolieVersus if you get to A-style ranking try taunting for a new taunt
[1:33:48] <ELFucilaNeroIV> IMO Knights of Cydonia by Muse would be a great ED for Steel Ball Run
[1:33:50] <yuribo26> @PlumpPotatoRump sbfpScared
[1:33:51] <SunsetJack> I learned recently that the people who made/sang this theme song was the same group who made Orchid's theme for the latest KI.
[1:33:53] <PlumpPotatoRump> 5 or 4 i think
[1:34:06] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Those stolen orbs go to the store so you can buy them later with real cas$$$
[1:34:07] <+sanstus2> @WoolieVersus So I'm definitely digging the smoother dodge with more i-frames, especially with how it auto sidesteps to behind your target, but does that make table hopper pointless now?
[1:34:07] <Who_lio42> how many breads have you eaten in your life?
[1:34:17] <scrubviewer> i wanna play this so bad but the xbone money iguess
[1:34:21] <gustavozxd> that game awards devil trigger was uhh
[1:34:22] <joylent_blue> yeah do more taunts PogChamp
[1:34:31] <yuribo26> @WritebroAlpha we can do it brother, I'm actually fitting better on some, but still a lot gotta go sbfpSnip sbfpSnip sbfpSnip
[1:34:35] <+comfyman12> By the way some madman managed to upload all the music in the demo, including that great guitar loading screen theme
[1:34:42] <GoogleyGareth> Wait what
[1:34:43] <Inebriateddonut> So those demons are just hustling Woolie?
[1:34:45] <pragmaticdissent> @sanstus2 You mean pointless outside of looking and feeling insanely cool?
[1:34:45] <iziwings> is the hood taunt in this demo
[1:34:45] <Who_lio42> TGA devil trigger was only ruined by bad mixing.
[1:34:46] <Fenrirlives> @WoolieVersus so did you talk about V's Bodyguards being DMC 1 enemies?
[1:34:49] <+Ssaik> OpieOP
[1:34:56] <scrubviewer> Where is this such music
[1:34:57] <+zanzibar_junker> god the game awards was poorly run
[1:35:00] <+abadbadman> @WoolieVersus a bit of fitness advice i give to people losing weight is to cycle or swim instead of running for less impact (from the discussion from the podcast)
[1:35:00] <gustavozxd> I heard the hood taunt is A rank
[1:35:02] <SsHomes> live actoin music like devil trigger never work out. remember the rules of nature live performance?
[1:35:13] <yuribo26> @zanzibar_junker WHAT? The TGAs? When did that ever happend Kappa
[1:35:17] <fairore> @sshomes oh...
[1:35:22] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Bad mixing can ruin even the greatest of songs.
[1:35:24] <Angry_Ev1L> NICE

[1:35:24] <+TylerDoesTwitch> Have we done a hoodie taunt yet?
[1:35:26] <+sanstus2> @pragmaticdissent I mean... hell you've got a point. Just bumps it down on my buy priority to "Already maxed out my moveset"
[1:35:30] <itsya_boi_gappy> its a b rank taunt the hood one

[1:35:59] <joylent_blue> YOU CAN REV WHILE STARTING STREAK WHAT
[1:36:00] <OkamiDude15> RESET THE RUN
[1:36:01] <fattness132> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[1:36:10] <DaedalusKrael> @WoolieVersus did you see V's gameplay in the new trailer? what did you think?
[1:36:10] <pragmaticdissent> @abadbadman That and if you're out running and you've over done it you still have to get home. If you're cycling or swimming you just....stop or get out of the pool.
[1:36:17] <fairore> @abadbadman but swimming uses your body though ?
[1:36:23] <+megamonmon123> i kept forgetting not to be stylish on dnd for dmc r
[1:36:28] <ZaibatsuFan> Woolie Sadden
[1:36:33] <+megamonmon123> 4 i meant
[1:36:34] <SsHomes> i wish te
[1:36:43] <+abadbadman> yes @pragmaticdissent @fairore well duh just not pounding your feet on the ground
[1:36:52] <yuribo26> V Kreygasm
[1:36:55] <gustavozxd> I watched that trailer quite a few times
[1:36:56] <Klefth> Does that sound kinda like DMC 3 music in the background?
[1:37:09] <SsHomes> i wish they removed that invisible wall. i know the game has to teach you about stuff like this
[1:37:11] <grayjammer> Lady was so fucking fun
[1:37:12] <+sanstus2> Beastmaster "V"ergil sounds pretty rad
[1:37:13] <yuribo26> Who here KappaPride for V?
[1:37:16] <+zanzibar_junker> could he be another vergil kid?
[1:37:17] <gustavozxd> lady is just dmc2
[1:37:19] <Who_lio42> V is just Sieg from Chaos Liegion
[1:37:19] <+Great_Sage> Lol you nerds
[1:37:21] <+kravdra> you already know im gonna be blasting only dmc3 music when the game comes out
[1:37:25] <itsya_boi_gappy> woolie how do you think the game will be handled? like will we be able to play the whole game as nero?
[1:37:28] <ELFucilaNeroIV> V uses minions to fight? Sounds like Chaos Legion.
[1:37:34] <memopek> @WoolieVersus did you see the "cameo system"?
[1:37:34] <Sokumotanaka> So V is a summoner
[1:37:41] <FeedbacK7777> @WoolieVersus you read about how multiplayer works yet? really cool system, its on the dmc website under "system"
[1:37:44] <+keksisblyat> Hope lady is playable in DMC V at some point. Even if it‚Äôs dlc
[1:37:46] <+superorangerobin> Big the cat is always here. watching
[1:37:48] <TakesGuts> chaos legion living through
[1:37:49] <+Great_Sage> lol big dick promises tho
[1:37:51] <scrubviewer> @woolieversus what is your favourite arm so far
[1:37:55] <+superkeaton> stream is kinda quiet
[1:37:57] <joylent_blue> naww he looked like he had trick teleportation
[1:37:58] <+megamonmon123> is V gonna finish them off shirtless in the rain?
[1:38:00] <gustavozxd> what's the story with pat and chaos legion
[1:38:01] <joylent_blue> speed won't matter
[1:38:02] <+Great_Sage> @WoolieVersus How do you suspect the multiplayer will work?
[1:38:13] <+superorangerobin> This is a chunky boi
[1:38:17] <+abadbadman> i love the Taurus Demon
[1:38:18] <FeedbacK7777> @Great_Sage it says under "system" in the website
[1:38:22] <+seaearthandsky> this is also a low difficulty so maybe
[1:38:22] <SsHomes> v has some teleports, it looks like he has to be the person to kill the enemy, summons just make them vulnerable
[1:38:29] <+abadbadman> need more Gold Pine Resin
[1:38:31] <OkamiDude15> stream so quiet i have to double my audio to hear it normally
[1:38:31] <sii_4> @WoolieVersus So far is it exceeding your expectations?
[1:38:35] <scrubviewer> i wanted V to have an ivy style whip sword
[1:38:40] <+zanzibar_junker> taurus demon
[1:38:43] <ELFucilaNeroIV> V particle effects remind me of Noctis.
[1:38:45] <fairore> @sshomes really ?
[1:38:46] <+kevinkevinson1> PogChamp
[1:38:47] <DaedalusKrael> Wyald + Taurus Demon
[1:38:51] <+vampirate1> @WoolieVersus I'm so fucking salty the demo is xbox only
[1:38:51] <+kevinkevinson1> THAT EXCEED
[1:38:54] <joylent_blue> MAX-acting expectations
[1:38:55] <SsHomes> looks like it
[1:38:57] <gustavozxd> V just has a warp strike too
[1:38:58] <FeedbacK7777> E X C E E D I N G expectations LUL
[1:39:09] <+sanstus2> Any idea if this is just a teaser version of this bosses fight? Maybe it does have a few extra moves that we're not seeing here. Strikes me as a cheeky little twist that Itsuno seems to like.
[1:39:18] <SsHomes> the dmc jp twitter posted a clip that points to it
[1:39:20] <+steak_bentley> every boss fight theme like this just sounds like collective consciousness from mgr to me
[1:39:38] <fairore> anybody wondering why v hair turned white ?
[1:39:43] <Ragnakawaii> He actually reloads after 3 shots now PogChamp
[1:39:46] <isolex_> @sanstus2 this is easy mode. I'm sure there will be other mechanics on the normal and beyond modes
[1:39:49] <+sanstus2> Of course, it could just also be the full fight and it's just an early game DMC boss
[1:39:51] <+seaearthandsky> his devil trigger @fairore
[1:39:53] <gustavozxd> @sanstus2 well, considering this is on easy, for sure
[1:39:55] <scrubviewer> i love that the bosses are talking shit at you again
[1:39:57] <OkamiDude15> @sanstus2 considering this demo is hard locked to easy mode im sure there are a couple of extra moves and enemies we arent seeing
[1:40:04] <faldin> @fairore I fully believe he's vergil's son
[1:40:18] <gustavozxd> I hope bosses get the insane look they get in DMD when they pop DT
[1:40:23] <gustavozxd> like berial with purple fire
[1:40:26] <+sanstus2> Oh, it is hard locked to easy? Gotcha. Played through a few times and wasn't sure
[1:40:30] <SsHomes> @fairore some suggested that he's channeling mundus' powers and it's breaking his body down
[1:40:36] <mardenombres> there is one at the other side of the stage
[1:40:37] <fairore> @seaearthandsky i thought he was full human hm
[1:40:39] <+TekkieX> Wait, Nero gets a fruit arm?
[1:40:40] <+sanstus2> definitely seemed a lot more paper than previous enteries
[1:40:42] <+jaytrident> bang, bang, bang, pull ny Devil trigger
[1:40:44] <mardenombres> Where you left the church
[1:40:46] <+megamonmon123> this was on easy? man
[1:40:47] <OkamiDude15> what if V is nero's son from the future? woopsMB probably not tho woopsKek
[1:40:52] <scrubviewer> oh damn even nero is roasting bosses now
[1:40:55] <+megamonmon123> that sucks
[1:41:03] <awesomeguyrequiem> Banana arm was Amazon JP exclusive last I checked
[1:41:07] <+Ssaik> Idk why but I love that 'mere demon' line
[1:41:08] <+megamonmon123> thos should have beem on heaven or hell MiniK
[1:41:10] <DaedalusKrael> @TekkieX Fruit Arm? what is this, gaim?
[1:41:12] <ELFucilaNeroIV> V's maybe the Soma Cruz of DMC. Kappa
[1:41:14] <+seaearthandsky> @fairore i say dt as a catch all, but from the looks of things thats a super mode where he gets access to the big boi demon
[1:41:26] <iziwings> GIVE HIM A TASTE OF THE GOOD SHIT
[1:41:29] <pragmaticdissent> Love how this bosses voice is the voice for basically EVERY first boss fight in the series.
[1:41:29] <fairore> @sshomes thats interesting
[1:41:33] <LegendGHT> wait what there's a demo?
[1:41:37] <gustavozxd> @ELFucilaNeroIV you know what that would be pretty sick
[1:41:39] <+MeanGeneTheGodHand> A friend and I hadconsidered that Vergil may actually have two kids._.
[1:41:42] <Parapattern> A green version of that guy with shaggy hair is how I would imagine Woolie as a demon
[1:41:46] <juxtest> @LegendGHT For the Xbox
[1:41:48] <+sanstus2> I do really like seeing the break age to escape from boss and enemy holds though. Reminds me of Nevan DT escapes.
[1:41:51] <OkamiDude15> @LegendGHT it got released yesterday but its only on xbone
[1:41:54] <+seaearthandsky> @fairore and hes a human that can control demons so i mean there some magic mumbo jumbo goin on for sure anyway
[1:41:58] <+Genuine_Jew> Gerbera will reflect his fireballs and other projectiles
[1:42:02] <Klefth> Man, that tracking overhead is some dark souls bullshit...
[1:42:05] <+NADeusX> Virgil: My dicks bigger
[1:42:06] <LegendGHT> is there gonna be one for ps4?
[1:42:11] <+kevinkevinson1> A LUL
[1:42:11] <TrafficCohen> V is Nero's long lost twin
[1:42:11] <DaedalusKrael> @WoolieVersus have you tried playing with no arms?
[1:42:13] <joylent_blue> LegendGHT at some point yes
[1:42:16] <+heyitsJayordan> DMC5? I've never clicked so fast.
[1:42:18] <+superorangerobin> Man that's a radical results screen
[1:42:19] <+bthevboi> DMC IS BACK
[1:42:19] <LegendGHT> shiiiiieeeeeeet
[1:42:23] <ELFucilaNeroIV> @gustavozxd yeah, like absorbing demons and using them like familiars could be really sick.
[1:42:23] <fairore> @faldin another son lol
[1:42:26] <bsmusic> IT"S BACK PogChamp
[1:42:28] <+megamonmon123> so gerbera is for projectile counters and oveture is for physical boss counters
[1:42:30] <memopek> @WoolieVersus did you see the multiplayer "cameo" system
[1:42:33] <SsHomes> nier POGGERS
[1:42:34] <alrobot2014> oh god what if the sons of sparda can only have twin sons
[1:42:34] <LegendGHT> Well that's cool
[1:42:36] <itsya_boi_gappy> V is a golem made with sparda blood
[1:42:41] <scrubviewer> devil may cry is back!
[1:42:46] <+abadbadman> which Jacket did you choose for the Special edition? @WoolieVersus :p
[1:42:47] <joylent_blue> i don't see the point of no arms
[1:42:47] <+Floofiie> Just busterless dmc4
[1:42:48] <LegendGHT> Stylish
[1:42:48] <Graxe_> It's just pure Nero, but Nero doesn't have all of his moves.
[1:42:49] <Ranger747> the reload animation is good
[1:42:50] <LamiaDarling> play with feet Kappa
[1:42:50] <OkamiDude15> i really want the ps4 demo to be a dante demo
[1:42:59] <iziwings> you get a little extra points for finishing with no arms yes
[1:43:00] <WritebroAlpha> Woolie, what's your opinion on the "Cameo System"?
[1:43:00] <scrubviewer> play in cripple mode
[1:43:02] <TrafficCohen> Sorry Nico Sorry Nico Sorry Nico Sorry Nico
[1:43:02] <DaedalusKrael> I thought maye you would get weak moves
[1:43:03] <SsHomes> reload with no arms
[1:43:05] <FenixSeraph> How long is an average run of the demo?
[1:43:09] <iziwings> you always have snatch though
[1:43:10] <SsHomes> LUL
[1:43:12] <fairore> @seaearthandsky yeah i believe that
[1:43:14] <+bthevboi> he would pick neros though
[1:43:16] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Play blindfolded. LUL
[1:43:17] <SsHomes> get one from china for 200
[1:43:18] <gustavozxd> you KNOW woolie bought all 3 of them
[1:43:18] <alrobot2014> with no arms you can still snatch
[1:43:21] <+Floofiie> Can you show it off?
[1:43:21] <OkamiDude15> obviously he bought V's jacket
[1:43:21] <+Flambage> What a stupid question! He obviously bought all 3
[1:43:21] <AlasterAngelo> he obviously chose the nero one
[1:43:24] <+heyitsJayordan> @WoolieVersus Do you like the broken glass UI?
[1:43:24] <mardenombres> >Implying he didn't bought all
[1:43:29] <LegendGHT> I gotta reconsider my Nero cosplay I was gonna do years ago again
[1:43:31] <+megamonmon123> woolie madden 2018 -"you need your snatch "
[1:43:40] <b1gboss007> IS CO-OP
[1:43:43] <TrafficCohen> Nero or Dante for Smash?
[1:43:46] <joylent_blue> if you're offline the cameo system will show pre-recorded dev gameplay, still pretty cool
[1:43:48] <Graxe_> It's not ghosts, it's other players joining in with you. Like how RE6 did it.
[1:43:48] <+kevinkevinson1> SHOW US THE JACKET
[1:43:48] <+megamonmon123> nero
[1:43:48] <+Blankets_and_Tea> breaking the arms in front of nico LUL
[1:43:48] <scrubviewer> cameo system sounds sick
[1:43:49] <GohanEgret> Dante
[1:43:53] <FeedbacK7777> @WoolieVersus CAMEO is Co-op for multiplayer as well, says on the website
[1:43:55] <SsHomes> ghost replays? does that mean your teammates can die?
[1:43:55] <+seaearthandsky> i think thats coop @WoolieVersus
[1:43:57] <+superorangerobin> It was the ONE ARMED MAN
[1:43:57] <+amurter19> im still not sure if you play one campaign with multiple characters or each one has a separate campaign?
[1:43:57] <AlasterAngelo> now we are full cripple
[1:43:57] <+megamonmon123> nero has an awesome grab mechanic
[1:43:57] <+Qsmash_> It's co-op OR replays
[1:43:58] <Graxe_> Well, ghosts offline, I guess.
[1:43:58] <+abadbadman> get SSS rank so Itsuno-sensei recognises you
[1:44:00] <+sanstus2> So it's like a Souls-esque "see what other players are doing right now" sorta system?
[1:44:02] <animehero92> Hey Woolie. Just wanted to say awesome job on the podcast. Ep 1 was great and best wishes with it.
[1:44:09] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus its either ghosts if your online or another player going through the same section as you

[1:44:29] <FenixSeraph> Was nero always left-handed?
[1:44:30] <scrubviewer> hope the enemies are scaled up for two people
[1:44:30] <WritebroAlpha> @sanstus2 If you're connected to the internet, it's not just ghost data, it's an actual other player in real-time
[1:44:33] <iziwings> i hope we get co op bloody palace at least
[1:44:34] <+Great_Sage> alas, select missions for multiplayer
[1:44:37] <+heyitsJayordan> Double LDK mode with 2 players

[1:44:39] <+zanzibar_junker> Did you see the Judge Eyes dub trailer. A lot of good voice actors in it.
[1:44:39] <joylent_blue> we don't know if BP has co-op or not yet i guess
[1:44:40] <TrafficCohen> TAUNT
[1:44:41] <WritebroAlpha> But only on certain missions
[1:44:43] <kouhi12> it is multiplayer just on some missions
[1:44:46] <fairore> @fenixseraph yes
[1:44:47] <b1gboss007> the bloody palace ptobable will have co-op
[1:44:51] <LegendGHT> I fucking love Nero
[1:44:56] <awesomeguyrequiem> You can even rate the other players post mission
[1:45:01] <+sanstus2> @WritebroAlpha Yeah, I was more talking about white phantoms where it's other players live, rather than death specteres
[1:45:10] <fairore> @b1gboss007 wtf

[1:45:37] <scrubviewer> i believe itsuno will make it work hope they can pull it off without loading screens

[1:47:15] <ArtOfExplosion> how come they chose to take shuffle out of this version of the demo?
[1:47:20] <gustavozxd> yo that move looked crazy that isn't in dmc3
[1:47:24] <+Qsmash_> just now noticed the enemies have a healthbar
[1:47:32] <Shaotanzhiten> Well, how is it?
[1:47:39] <+sanstus2> @Yokuho It's really fucking smooth feeling.
[1:47:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Low ranking should play the live version of Devil Trigger from the VGAs
[1:47:44] <b1gboss007> @qsmash_ is been there since dmc3
[1:47:49] <DaedalusKrael> they had healthbars since 3 at least
[1:47:49] <Graxe_> @Qsmash_ They do. It's the lock-on icon.
[1:47:51] <+Yokuho> damn, I can't fucking wait for it
[1:47:55] <+megamonmon123> get rid of that hand

[1:48:11] <+heyitsJayordan> a wire in his stump
[1:48:12] <joylent_blue> the no arm kinda freaks me out
[1:48:13] <WritebroAlpha> @LegendGHT Motivation
[1:48:15] <+Great_Sage> lol the no arm snatch
[1:48:16] <Graxe_> It's more prominent in this and in 4 with Nero, though.
[1:48:17] <etalmeta> the is a wire launcher in the arm port
[1:48:18] <Xenodile> Little grabby claw that connects the hands to his stump
[1:48:21] <itsya_boi_gappy> im excited for kh 3 but man dmc 5 is on another level
[1:48:33] <+sanstus2> @LegendGHT Shonen hot blood energy.\

[1:48:42] <Emdhad> man i still have like 19 characters to unlock in smash
[1:48:45] <gustavozxd> I wonder how the clap taunt looks without the arm LUL
[1:48:47] <joylent_blue> thats like how he did it in the opening of 4 PogChamp
[1:48:48] <LegendGHT> Wonder if Kyrie likes the no arm snatch
[1:48:49] <AlasterAngelo> i wonder if the cutscene will change
[1:48:51] <SsHomes> LUL

[1:49:25] <LegendGHT> what's the number on the side of the van?
[1:49:29] <+sanstus2> Good ole' rape van music
[1:49:30] <Retrocop87> can't open a car door with one arm
[1:49:32] <+Qsmash_> it's okay, it has windows
[1:49:32] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:49:36] <+MarshallLee67> if it had "devil may cry" on the side i would absolutely get inside of it
[1:49:37] <+Gogogolem> oh hey woolie
[1:49:39] <FenixSeraph> it's the Party Van
[1:49:40] <Invess> It's a camper though
[1:49:40] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus this is what ice cream vans look like in the south
[1:49:40] <+bthevboi> cause hes a punk
[1:49:40] <+DatLatinoGuy> LUL
[1:49:47] <+comfyman12> Hey kids, want some free orbs?
[1:49:49] <ELFucilaNeroIV> DMCV: Phantom Pain LUL LUL
[1:49:53] <gustavozxd> he has no arm in the cutsene YES LUL
[1:49:55] <AlasterAngelo> hey he's got no arm in the cutscene
[1:49:57] <+kinggooglyeyes> my car is called the mystery wagon
[1:49:58] <OkamiDude15> but woolie if she offered you a DEVIL BREAKER you wouldnt be talking smack
[1:49:59] <Aussie_Manny> GETSUGA TENSHOU!
[1:49:59] <CapCasual> @WoolieVersus So Pat is the one to play it on the SBF channel?
[1:50:00] <iziwings> Y'ALL WANT SOME ARMS
[1:50:00] <Invess> Just tell people you solve mysteries
[1:50:01] <+Gogogolem> Woolie why are you ahting on the mystery machine?
[1:50:01] <Inebriateddonut> FREE DEVIL MAY CRY scrawled on the side
[1:50:06] <Ranger747> I wonder if thats street legal
[1:50:08] <+MarshallLee67> not exactly but close
[1:50:10] <+zanzibar_junker> plenty of those in FL
[1:50:13] <DatAsuna> I wonder if this means cutscenes willavoid having him grip things with the arm too often
[1:50:17] <Emdhad> Having an LED sign on the side of a car must break some type of law somewhere
[1:50:17] <Ragnakawaii> What would your ideal Devil May Cry van look like @WoolieVersus ?
[1:50:22] <LegendGHT> the May Cry Machine
[1:50:27] <+sanstus2> "Dante, I'm already a demon." "Goddamnit kid that's the fourth time you've made that joke today."
[1:50:28] <bsmusic> After DmC, the health bars look so beefy
[1:50:33] <MrHappyFunshine> The van has lit signage on it, you'd be going up ask what they selling
[1:50:33] <OkamiDude15> the dante mobile woopsKek
[1:50:36] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Ice Cream vans do not exist in my country. :(
[1:50:38] <+Gogogolem> We have to solve the mystery of how to kill these demons.
[1:50:40] <WritebroAlpha> @sanstus2 Noice
[1:50:42] <SsHomes> this fist makes the ground tremmor and stagger you? sick
[1:50:44] <+Gogogolem> stabbing seems effective
[1:50:58] <+vampirate1> @WoolieVersus one of my friends used to call them pussy wagons, because all the local animal control people drove them, and they always seemed to have a ton of cats.
[1:50:59] <DatAsuna> Just put a DMC sign on your van to abduct woolie
[1:51:06] <LegendGHT> Having just played DMC4 this game looks beautiful
[1:51:13] <DaedalusKrael> the scooby doo gang will solve the mystery of DIO's stand
[1:51:20] <fairore> i wonder if vergil going to look old or not
[1:51:26] <+Floofiie> Its times like these where you miss Gerbera
[1:51:27] <WritebroAlpha> @Gogogolem "Tough enemy ahead, therefore, piercing is effective"
[1:51:45] <SsHomes> he does, if you deal more damage, he says more lines
[1:51:46] <+abadbadman> maybe if he has one arm he's less sure of himself
[1:51:52] <Emdhad> i prefer "thrust is effective"
[1:52:02] <DatAsuna> So I guess this means he could literally win with one arm behind his back
[1:52:09] <WritebroAlpha> "sticky white stuff"
[1:52:15] <TrafficCohen> ASS
[1:52:15] <+sanstus2> ugh, the smooth animation on the environmental destruction, unf.
[1:52:18] <+Gogogolem> I don't really like thise demons design
[1:52:33] <DatAsuna> That's cause it's a dragon's dogma design sans wings
[1:52:39] <Emdhad> Kinda looks like a funky orangutan
[1:52:42] <DatAsuna> and more hair
[1:52:47] <TrafficCohen> ORANGUERRA
[1:52:54] <Emdhad> I'M THE KING OF THE SWINGERS
[1:52:55] <itsya_boi_gappy> i disagree i enjoy them alot @Gogogolem
[1:52:55] <+sanstus2> @Gogogolem It's the first DMC boss of the game, iirc. They always look really generic.
[1:52:55] <FenixSeraph> I'm meh on the overall art design but the environmental destruction looks beautiful
[1:52:56] <LegendGHT> he reminds me of beowulf bug bigger
[1:52:57] <fairore> @gogogolem eh hes the first boss
[1:52:58] <TakesGuts> it's just first boss Big demonman
[1:53:04] <LegendGHT> *but
[1:53:10] <DaedalusKrael> yeah its very Oranguerra
[1:53:19] <+Gogogolem> Well the big demons in Devil may cry have never been the best. Its usually enimies you size or smaller that are the ones that are the most fun to fight.
[1:53:27] <+LogothX> Oh, its the same demo as NYC Comic Con
[1:53:28] <rufus2k2> I respect the armless run
[1:53:29] <+KSabot> busting in his face huh
[1:53:30] <GohanEgret> m o r t i s
[1:53:34] <gustavozxd> oh the bleeding glass
[1:53:35] <+cyanide_xz> without the arm the boss fight turns into a souls fight
[1:53:37] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus would you say that Nero is best in the air Kappa
[1:53:38] <b1gboss007> OOF look at this fake fan
[1:53:38] <+AppleBasket> Why isn‚Äôt Woolie using the air?
[1:53:39] <ELFucilaNeroIV> The RE engine is good stuff. Targets high framerate. SeemsGood
[1:53:39] <iziwings> oh shit look at that UI change
[1:53:43] <+sanstus2> oooooo bloody glass shards on the ui at low health
[1:53:45] <Invess> SMTV
[1:53:46] <Brainworm205> Get fucking comboed, woolie
[1:53:49] <LegendGHT> You didn't lose
[1:53:49] <Inebriateddonut> FUKKIN SICK
[1:53:49] <joylent_blue> the FUCK
[1:53:49] <+sanstus2> that's fun
[1:53:53] <bsmusic> Damn
[1:53:57] <+Gogogolem> grandson of sparda
[1:54:00] <WritebroAlpha> [HMMM INTENSIFIES]
[1:54:04] <GohanEgret> it's basically saying "git gud"
[1:54:06] <+sanstus2> @WoolieVersus Seed of the Seed of Sparda
[1:54:09] <+LogothX> Bloodborne fail screen
[1:54:09] <+sanstus2> Cmon man
[1:54:12] <Graxe_> If I recall, only a few DMC games actually say "You are dead".
[1:54:14] <LegendGHT> then third impact happens?
[1:54:14] <DatAsuna> He hurt your pride, that's the real defeat
[1:54:20] <joylent_blue> ABANDON ALL HOPE
[1:54:21] <Emdhad> Yeah but what the fuck is that piercing the sky woolie
[1:54:23] <DatAsuna> Race traitor woolie again?
[1:54:24] <awesomeguyrequiem> So demo doesn't have the revive system
[1:54:28] <time_axis> Death is a hunter unbeknownst to its prey
[1:54:30] <+Gogogolem> That demons like i got the moral vicotory
[1:54:34] <Brainworm205> THE SHADOW REMAINS CAST
[1:54:35] <DaedalusKrael> reminds me of the Nocturne game over
[1:54:38] <VorpalSlash> Isn't that the name of the pachinko machine Kappa
[1:54:42] <big_cheese21> "Time to kick some ass" Let's go, Woolie!! Nero deserves better!
[1:54:44] <+Gogogolem> Hes goes to his demon buddies and is like. I made a son of sparda embarrassed.
[1:54:44] <ELFucilaNeroIV> That line belongs in an Anime Fighter LUL
[1:54:47] <joylent_blue> don't let it be over BibleThump
[1:54:49] <DatAsuna> Nocturne featuring Dante from the shin megami tensei series
[1:54:51] <+zanzibar_junker> Do you still think a Sparda game wouldn't work?
[1:54:53] <PlumpPotatoRump> :P thanks for the demo

[1:55:57] <joylent_blue> this game is making me so happy
[1:55:59] <big_cheese21> Why is Nero actually the coolest tho?
[1:56:09] <itsya_boi_gappy> this is a well made game i am beyond excited we been waiting 10 years for a real dmc game
[1:56:13] <joylent_blue> Nero is the best
[1:56:14] <gustavozxd> the animations look incredible
[1:56:18] <SsHomes> descending bloody palace would be sick. then vergil at the bottom
[1:56:19] <+VariantX7> did I miss the stylebeasting???

[1:56:22] <DatAsuna> YEE
[1:56:23] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus does it exceed expectations?
[1:56:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Big Mundus
[1:56:25] <DatAsuna> Talk mad shit
[1:56:26] <KaseKaizer> it's not terrible
[1:56:28] <+bthevboi> Vs theme BANGS
[1:56:31] <+kevinkevinson1> SHOW US THE JACKET WOOLIE
[1:56:32] <gustavozxd> I liked it
[1:56:33] <GohanEgret> it's ok on repeat listens
[1:56:34] <bsmusic> Yeeah...
[1:56:34] <fairore> go-ahead
[1:56:35] <SsHomes> v's theme is not terrible
[1:56:36] <+Qsmash_> not as bad as subhuman at least
[1:56:36] <dbgt5551> V's theme is awesome
[1:56:37] <TrafficCohen> Nero or Dante for Smash????????
[1:56:37] <alrobot2014> what's V's theme?
[1:56:39] <FenixSeraph> It sounds better than Subhuman but I don't think I could listen to it for a long time
[1:56:42] <+bthevboi> its totally graveyard punk its great
[1:56:44] <faldin> I dug V's theme
[1:56:46] <+spiraljoel> it reminds me a lot of kap bambino and i liked it a lot
[1:56:51] <Inebriateddonut> It's better than Subhuman at least
[1:56:51] <Laironx3> it slaps.
[1:56:52] <EmptyFist> I like V' theme alot
[1:56:53] <+bthevboi> Emo lord
[1:56:54] <joylent_blue> BEN SWOLO
[1:56:56] <DaedalusKrael> V's theme is cool instrumentally but I DESPISE the vocals
[1:56:56] <fairore> its fine for v
[1:56:59] <SsHomes> lyrics references mundus multiple times
[1:57:01] <Rellim80> Play Darksiders, coward.
[1:57:04] <Them00n> He quotes fucking poetry at you.
[1:57:06] <+bthevboi> Chu2lad
[1:57:09] <DaedalusKrael> they really dont sound good
[1:57:09] <TakesGuts> it's gonne be alright in-game, subhuman too
[1:57:10] <SsHomes> crimson cloud is the mundus eyes
[1:57:10] <LegendGHT> So Nero is Punk, Dante is Rock, and V is Goth?
[1:57:11] <FenixSeraph> I bet LittleVMills could fix it
[1:57:13] <+AppleBasket> He‚Äôs reaaaaally edgy in trailer
[1:57:15] <fairore> slow playstlye
[1:57:18] <@SoushinSen> Does V reminds you of our mutual friend Julien, the rock singer?
[1:57:19] <+VietcongSamurai> V's Theme vocal is oddly paced in my opinion.
[1:57:21] <GoogleyGareth> Too bad he doesn't have a fedora
[1:57:22] <PlumpPotatoRump> i originally expected like a rock oprah kind thing xD
[1:57:24] <FenixSeraph> V's hippie sandals
[1:57:30] <Brainworm205> He‚Äôs in Devil May Cry. Of course he‚Äôs fucking edgy
[1:57:33] <mardenombres> Dont forget that he uses sandals
[1:57:34] <alrobot2014> the fuck is this notification for DmC Devil May Cry Part 15 DansGame
[1:57:37] <big_cheese21> At least V isn't hanging around with his mom all day
[1:57:42] <+comfyman12> I like new Subhuman tbh. The new vocals are way better
[1:57:44] <Mrbaconator> Vs song is terrible
[1:57:48] <Tampaoster> The walking cane always make me remember a clockwork orange
[1:57:49] <yukichocomilk> you're wrong DansGame
[1:57:49] <xxafrodragonxx> Darksiders! Plz
[1:57:50] <itsya_boi_gappy> nero still has the best theme LUL
[1:57:50] <FenixSeraph> V's theme is the kind of song that could be done well if you changed the vocalist
[1:57:51] <+sanstus2> @alrobot2014 DLC MOTHERFUCKER
[1:58:02] <alrobot2014> IT SAID PART FINAL LAST TIME
[1:58:02] <TrafficCohen> DmC PART 15
[1:58:04] <fairore> @fenixseraph probably
[1:58:05] <joylent_blue> YEAH WOOLIE'S DOWNFALL
[1:58:05] <Ranger747> @comfyman12 they re did the vocals?
[1:58:06] <TrafficCohen> WOOOLIE YOU LIARS
[1:58:07] <+Great_Sage> lololol
[1:58:10] <OkamiDude15> wasnt sub human written for Dino instead of dante?
[1:58:15] <FenixSeraph> It's got a better core melody than Subhuman's IMO
[1:58:16] <bsmusic> DmC DLC, woo
[1:58:16] <+abadbadman> Woolie's only entry level music fan :p
[1:58:21] <dbgt5551> Shut up its great
[1:58:23] <DatAsuna> Do more good
[1:58:25] <Xenodile> So Vergil had Power and Fatherrrr, Dante has Motherrrrr, Nero has KYRIEEEE, what will V have? Place your bets!
[1:58:25] <wired_soul> be more good
[1:58:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> boo-urns
[1:58:30] <Inebriateddonut> I'm pretty much the same
[1:58:32] <EmptyFist> Wait until this opinion changes when the game comes out
[1:58:32] <TrafficCohen> DlC?
[1:58:34] <Them00n> @WoolieVersus STOP HAVING OPINIONS
[1:58:36] <+comfyman12> @Ranger747 Yeah they did it. You can hear it in the VGA trailer
[1:58:39] <ELFucilaNeroIV> V's theme lacks a driving beat.
[1:58:41] <cherubsanonymous> It's fine you coward
[1:58:50] <joylent_blue> its FINE
[1:58:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Watch the backdown when the game comes out
[1:58:51] <+Qsmash_> TAKE SUBHUMAN OFF THE PODCAST PRE-SHOW
[1:58:52] <DaedalusKrael> how much is the old DMC music DLC?
[1:58:57] <DatAsuna> PC version so I can switch it out for NieR music
[1:58:57] <itsya_boi_gappy> you guys are playing th eDLC?
[1:58:57] <TrafficCohen> Nero or Dante for Smash?
[1:59:00] <+D2_Synua> Isn't the entire OST written by the same dude?
[1:59:00] <FenixSeraph> Devil Trigger sucked out the awesomeness of the other two themes to be so good
[1:59:01] <GohanEgret> 2BAE
[1:59:03] <Inebriateddonut> It's fine just play Lock and Load for everything
[1:59:05] <+VietcongSamurai> YE BOI!

[2:05:56] <ThirdStrike_Alex> SPOILERS: I'm out y'all
[2:06:02] <big_cheese21> I still can't believe how many spoilers are in that opening cinematic...
[2:06:04] <EnderGamma> Yo what
[2:06:13] <EnderGamma> This is not the title screen I expected
[2:06:15] <+zanzibar_junker> i wosh thry have a fate for the 2b sc6 dlc
[2:06:19] <Emdhad> @endergamma oh shit what up dide
[2:06:22] <Emdhad> dude
[2:06:27] <EVA_Unit02> peace
[2:06:28] <+zanzibar_junker> goddammit
[2:06:32] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus speaking of automata did you try out any of the stuff I sent you about aerial kicks/fastfall resets? The Moon laser spike finisher is peak style.
[2:06:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Remember when they showed Kaine getting stabbed in the first Neir's intro
[2:06:42] <sii_4> well im going out
[2:06:47] <sii_4> see ya fam
[2:06:49] <MelBrooksKA> I am so far behind on the LP, one day I will catch up
[2:06:58] <DatAsuna> Japan cares not for spoiler warnings
[2:07:02] <EnderGamma> That's not what I meant. I expected the final title screen.
[2:07:05] <MelBrooksKA> But I saw Liam and Pat play, so I'm fine
[2:07:10] <DaedalusKrael> yeah I'm leaving, I got see episode 15 of you and pats DmC DMC LP
[2:07:12] <+Revets315> @WoolieVersus Have you seen Hades?
[2:07:14] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus you gonna do the thing with Liam there?
[2:07:16] <DatAsuna> Japan will instead give you so many spoilers that they try to fakeout spoil
[2:07:29] <+DespondentSloth> Nier has DLC?
[2:07:35] <EnderGamma> @WoolieVersus this was the one I expected https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lUcgP_GLd_4/maxresdefault.jpg
[2:07:39] <+kevinkevinson1> IM OUT
[2:07:45] <DatAsuna> I can't believe Woolie is stealing viewers from Woolie
[2:07:48] <+zanzibar_junker> 2b armor so good
[2:07:49] <cherubsanonymous> OH WOW LITERALLY JUST REFRESHED
[2:07:50] <iamtheTwitchghost> vergin
[2:07:58] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus MORE DmC?!? OH SHIT GOTTA GO!
[2:08:00] <+DatLatinoGuy> lmao
[2:08:04] <+DatLatinoGuy> it's fine, Woolie
[2:08:04] <big_cheese21> Look at 2B! What an absolute fucking unit!
[2:08:07] <DaedalusKrael> sorry woolie
[2:08:09] <Futurecity10> people are lazy
[2:08:13] <+bonzosan> i noticed the last dmc part thumbnail changed from final
[2:08:15] <MelBrooksKA> I'm still here for you Woolie
[2:08:17] <+zanzibar_junker> hot damn 2b
[2:08:18] <EnderGamma> I still have friends that REFUSE to start their playthrough of this
[2:08:18] <mashiyyat> Im super not out :D
[2:08:20] <DatAsuna> Well you are, they're just latER
[2:08:22] <+D2_Synua> If you care about Automata you should have finished it by now
[2:08:26] <+bonzosan> I thought the same
[2:08:27] <+EVOriginal> Get these bustas outta here! atpRtsd
[2:08:27] <Shiranui24> jk i'll stay
[2:08:27] <keiji_maede> TOO much shit~
[2:08:32] <herush> im in for sidequests
[2:08:36] <Emdhad> A lot of people fell off after ending A
[2:08:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> I've finished it thrice
[2:08:38] <OkamiDude15> @DespondentSloth the dlc is special battle areas where you can get some special costumes when you beat the last tier
[2:08:49] <cervidaequus> I havent watched or seen anything of nier due to lack of time/interest in 100 hr rpgs, but ill watch this stream cuz its happening in front of me
[2:08:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I had actually just finished Pat's runthrough when Woolie uploaded episode 1 of his. Bit burned out at the time
[2:08:56] <didgereedoodah> do it camera coward
[2:09:05] <didgereedoodah> *on camera
[2:09:06] <alrobot2014> if you need memory alloy you can farm them at the forest kingdom castle front doors
[2:09:07] <+SinisterBroccoli> What's your chips woolz?
[2:09:20] <OkamiDude15> so is it time to GRIND?! woopsHyper
[2:09:20] <+zanzibar_junker> got ready to spam r2 against emil
[2:09:23] <+Great_Sage> im playing nier myself, so i stopped at like episode 8 lol
[2:09:27] <DynemaUmbra> na man grinding is perfect for streaming, time to shoot the shit with people
[2:09:29] <reiju_22> I prefer watching this game as a stream for some reason
[2:09:31] <EnderGamma> I think more people dropped off during route B
[2:09:35] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus you're the one with the stats
[2:09:39] <mashiyyat> Its fun to hear the music though. Kappa
[2:09:45] <Shiranui24> right?
[2:10:00] <Graxe_> Grinding is good stream material if you have stuff to talk about to chat. That's how I've found Dragon's Dogma streams ending up being and they're fun,
[2:10:01] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus doesnt the ps4 trophy have a percentage based on how many people bought the game? couldnt you check with that?
[2:10:04] <mashiyyat> Have you used the Destroyers outfit yet?
[2:10:11] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you could get stats right now, just check trophies and rarity
[2:10:12] <MelBrooksKA> This isn
[2:10:17] <+bonzosan> the only thing woolie grinds for are combos
[2:10:18] <+Great_Sage> @OkamiDude15 They mean people who watched his LP, not the game
[2:10:25] <Emdhad> Have you done the couple yet?
[2:10:28] <MelBrooksKA> This isn't Devil May Cry!? spyCappa
[2:10:33] <Emdhad> THAT couple
[2:10:35] <OkamiDude15> oh woopsLUL
[2:10:35] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Since there's trphies for ending A and B you could just compare the rarity
[2:10:37] <alrobot2014> wandering couple starts in pascals villiage
[2:10:57] <+Great_Sage> They're thinking people who bought it, not who's watching the LP
[2:11:02] <gameaholic42> Yeah, definitely do wandering couple first
[2:11:15] <+Great_Sage> We're talking about the LP he's doing, guys lol
[2:11:21] <startstoprepeat> to see how many people stopped at ending a
[2:11:22] <+Greezey> woolie does investigations
[2:11:24] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Check trophies for your PSN account
[2:11:29] <Retrocop87> Confused viewers confusing Woolie
[2:11:33] <Graxe_> You were talking about data on who beat ending A and stopped there.
[2:11:34] <Zepik> they're talking about PSN trophies
[2:11:35] <Emdhad> Basically it shows what percentage of people got that trophy
[2:11:39] <Solidus_113> guys I think Woolie was talking about the LP
[2:11:39] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus If you check your trophy, it will say what % of players got said trophy, that'll give you a hint at how many people burned out after ending A
[2:11:40] <+SinisterBroccoli> He's talking about people who have beaten ending A not about your items
[2:11:42] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Woolie, what are we doing first, weapon grinding or Quests
[2:11:42] <+KanjiTatsumi> He's talking about how many people have gotten past ending A by checking PS4 tropphies
[2:11:44] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus you can look at global ps4 trophy stats.
[2:11:52] <+Great_Sage> No he meant percentage of people who stopped watching after ending A on his LP I think, could be wrong
[2:11:57] <Emdhad> so if you wanna see who completed what ending you'd look at the trophies
[2:12:03] <MelBrooksKA> They're talking about for the statistics
[2:12:05] <tfei42> i love automata
[2:12:11] <Shiranui24> @Great_Sage i did
[2:12:17] <+Great_Sage> o ok
[2:12:26] <+Great_Sage> i dunno man, now im confused lol
[2:12:31] <Shiranui24> he read it out of time
[2:12:44] <yuribo26> Can I donate an imgur link to see your reaction? Its a Kirby joke @WoolieVersus
[2:12:46] <Emdhad> 30 second delay
[2:12:50] <DatAsuna> Riding close, yeah
[2:12:55] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus chapter 5 should get you the start of wandering couple in pascals village
[2:12:58] <Solidus_113> usually starting at the Missile Mission quest is the best place for the most quests
[2:12:58] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Damn, 9% is higher than I would think
[2:13:00] <Emdhad> best way to converse
[2:13:09] <bathoi> %9 damn
[2:13:13] <startstoprepeat> 15% of people didn't beat the prologue D:
[2:13:14] <OkamiDude15> woof
[2:13:15] <yuribo26> Look at all those losers who didn't even finish it
[2:13:17] <Soapydishwater> @Sphincter_Spelunker well you can just buy all the trophies so it makes sense
[2:13:23] <+Great_Sage> >Watch 2b die
[2:13:26] <+Great_Sage> well i've been ruined lol
[2:13:31] <yuribo26> Thats good actually
[2:13:35] <DatAsuna> Yeah, trophy stats make it real sad how many people never finish anything
[2:13:42] <+Great_Sage> Not mad though, my fault for being here lol
[2:13:42] <+DespondentSloth> that's pretty good, a lot of games have much less than that
[2:13:48] <Zepik> best bang-for-your-buck quest spots would be right before the side quest cut off from route A/B. Pick a chapter before the mission in the flooded city
[2:13:52] <grayjammer> Yeah those are normal precentages for the progression of most games
[2:13:56] <T_Sasquatch> You'd be shocked how many people don't get the first trophy
[2:14:00] <+zanzibar_junker> woooffff
[2:14:06] <yuribo26> D:
[2:14:08] <startstoprepeat> nero automata?
[2:14:10] <DatAsuna> BIG SPOILS FOR BIG BOIS
[2:14:12] <+VidulaSaix> Nero Automata
[2:14:15] <Shiranui24> There were a bunch of warnings
[2:14:18] <+Big_Dream> i 100% this game
[2:14:24] <cervidaequus> Change stream title to BIG SPOILZ
[2:14:26] <alrobot2014> i kinda wanna see what 2b would look like if she ate red orbs Kappa
[2:14:32] <EnderGamma> I never got the awesome feeling of using chapter select because I got caught up in the moment and you know. Made the choice.
[2:14:34] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus maybe put it in the stream title?
[2:14:39] <+Great_Sage> I'm ok with spoilers, not too dead on not being spoiled. I just thought it was funny how spoily the trophies are. Just "2B fuckin dies"
[2:14:43] <bearwagon> my name is Dante
[2:14:45] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @alrobot2014 Lucia, maybe
[2:14:58] <DatAsuna> I believe this is the traitors
[2:15:08] <+Big_Dream> "2b dies" see true ending
[2:15:08] <Solidus_113> yeah the YorHa deserters
[2:15:13] <+SinisterBroccoli> You can always check for ungathered quests on the map screen
[2:15:23] <+KanjiTatsumi> bigspoilz.exe
[2:15:33] <Zepik> you can't repeat side quests so any red dots on the map are stuff you haven't done yet
[2:15:47] <DatAsuna> OHNO
[2:15:58] <DatAsuna> This could also be the desert rose
[2:16:08] <+Big_Dream> @WoolieVersus whay you need sir
[2:16:17] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus chapter 5 in pascal's village should have a quest
[2:16:19] <+rei0> what quest do you want?
[2:16:21] <+SinisterBroccoli> How much Emil stuff have you seen Woolie?
[2:16:24] <+Big_Dream> @WoolieVersus got this game all plated it up
[2:16:29] <Emdhad> Man the ending to the DmC lp was amazing dude literally just skated away
[2:16:30] <AzureHawk_Streams> Did he play DMC5 already?
[2:16:30] <EnderGamma> Are we looking to make combat even more obsolete?
[2:16:36] <didgereedoodah> this might be the Jackass arena quest
[2:16:37] <+bonzosan> yes
[2:16:37] <OkamiDude15> @AzureHawk_Streams yeah
[2:16:43] <Zepik> your best bet is to load in to a chapter, pull up the big map, and look around for red ??? dots. They're quest givers
[2:16:44] <AzureHawk_Streams> F*CK!!!
[2:16:44] <DatAsuna> Moose too strong
[2:16:47] <grayjammer> TBH after playing this game 4 times ive got no clue whhat the hell this quest oughta be
[2:16:48] <EnderGamma> There's a pretty silly combination of chips that makes you unkillable
[2:16:49] <Menarii> @Great_Sage Don't be discouraged by that. The story is very much worth seeing through even with that small thing you imagine being a bigger thing that it is. If anything, it'll give you an interesting perspective when going through this game :>
[2:16:50] <Shiranui24> So can we just drop huge nier spoils in chat ?
[2:16:52] <Who_lio42> NO MOOSE MAPPING
[2:17:01] <Retrocop87> You live in Canada Woolie, you should know about the limits of Moose tech
[2:17:01] <Emdhad> Can you drift in these moose?
[2:17:09] <Emdhad> on*
[2:17:15] <MelBrooksKA> It's a jamming moose!
[2:17:16] <JoeNeutrino> No moose map? What even is this shitty game?
[2:17:20] <alrobot2014> now that i think about it how small are these moose?
[2:17:24] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus If you don't have the sidequest active, it may be in your mail
[2:17:26] <+Great_Sage> @Menarii Yeah nah, i'm ok with it lol, I kind of came into it knowing some stuff. I don't mind surprise big events, as I like all of the story. I was simply throwing out a joke, seems im not funny q-q
[2:17:30] <alrobot2014> or how big are these andoroids
[2:17:34] <MelBrooksKA> 3/10, no moose map
[2:17:35] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Just avoid stuff beyond ending B. Or don't big spoil at all to be safe
[2:17:37] <OkamiDude15> @Shiranui24 i gues everything except for the emil side quest in post game
[2:17:51] <gameaholic42> Some do, some don't :/
[2:17:51] <+Big_Dream> @WoolieVersus some of them are chapter specific
[2:17:58] <grayjammer> Yeah check your mail perhaps
[2:17:59] <+SinisterBroccoli> You may have to get further into the story
[2:17:59] <Emdhad> @alrobot2014 well the boar are gigantic so probably out of proportion
[2:18:00] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus I might be wrong, but this quest you need to go to the bunker
[2:18:02] <+Big_Dream> @WoolieVersus what side ques tyou looking for
[2:18:06] <didgereedoodah> you might need to progress into the chapter a bit more
[2:18:07] <DatAsuna> Yeah he gcaught there's one you can do here
[2:18:11] <BobcatGat> Check your mail, might be in there
[2:18:11] <Menarii> @Great_Sage Haha, I get that. I'm just always down for getting more people to play through this game!
[2:18:11] <T_Sasquatch> I would never delete my save file for some nonsense sentiment. fuck that LUL
[2:18:14] <Zepik> could also be on the bunker
[2:18:14] <Screamlord_Bonerhitler> You might need to check emails @woolieversus
[2:18:15] <MelBrooksKA> This is going super well
[2:18:16] <+Great_Sage> mhm
[2:18:20] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Shot in the dark, go to the bunker
[2:18:23] <+Great_Sage> I actually should play more of it lol
[2:18:24] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus have you done 60's quest that starts at the bunker
[2:18:33] <Solidus_113> i'm to pull out the wiki guide
[2:18:34] <+Great_Sage> but smush time
[2:18:36] <Solidus_113> time*
[2:18:37] <gameaholic42> Honestly, some of us just need to pull up the wiki
[2:18:42] <DatAsuna> @alrobot2014 6O's start from mail
[2:18:43] <Shiranui24> @OkamiDude15 is that before or after you delete your save
[2:19:00] <+Big_Dream> @WoolieVersus did you eat mackerel
[2:19:12] <Pajex_> FeelsBadMan
[2:19:14] <+DespondentSloth> relatable
[2:19:16] <alrobot2014> there was one where you go the bunker to start it though
[2:19:16] <+critfumble_> god i wish i could play more of this game but im getting an unsolvable display error which means i cant play anymore of it ive tried fixing for hours
[2:19:17] <didgereedoodah> that's DLC email
[2:19:28] <Retrocop87> oh man, I was on another tab and I thought that was a donation message
[2:19:28] <DatAsuna> Game creator
[2:19:28] <Solidus_113> I think that's the Plato Music Video
[2:19:30] <Retrocop87> Jesus
[2:19:31] <Graxe_> That might be the email Liam mentioned for the end of the DLC.
[2:19:36] <Flameking> i believe most of 2B quests will appear after the hole in the city.
[2:19:56] <OkamiDude15> @Shiranui24 before. woolie has to get every weapon in the game to rank 4 before he can actually finish it
[2:19:58] <Emdhad> Flame is correct
[2:20:03] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Yeah, go to the bunker and talk to 6O
[2:20:13] <+Arkfyre> 6O is a precious cinnamon role
[2:20:17] <DatAsuna> Desert rose can be done from the getgo
[2:20:17] <+Arkfyre> roll*
[2:20:18] <+KanjiTatsumi> (;_;)
[2:20:19] <+bonzosan> animu
[2:20:21] <EnderGamma> I think the Operators don't get enough love
[2:20:22] <alrobot2014> i love 6O
[2:20:23] <FenixSeraph> 6O a cute
[2:20:38] <JoeNeutrino> Pascal neohHart
[2:20:40] <Soapydishwater> Does anyone else feel like there were big parts of this game that were cut out? I feel like the copied city was supposed to be a whole area but it was cut down to a cutscene corridor
[2:20:52] <Futurecity10> Yeah, I remember now, I missed this quest on my second playthrough, I was super pissed
[2:21:05] <alrobot2014> anyone know if the bunker crash dialogue changes if you go back to it after doing 6O's quest
[2:21:05] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Word of warning, chapter select resets active sidequests in some cases. The one you're saving for with Liam has a lot of steps so resetting that one is an extra pain in the butt.
[2:21:06] <Solidus_113> @Soapydishwater play after ending B
[2:21:25] <+critfumble_> anyone else here have a display error where the game runs fine but stops displaying on the monitor? it just hitches on start up and stops displaying and it feels like ive tried everything
[2:21:27] <+Big_Dream> never stop dashing
[2:21:56] <alrobot2014> ohhh this quest
[2:21:56] <DatAsuna> Just a heads up not to chapter select during the session. :)
[2:21:57] <+JayEarly> 6O is an angel
[2:22:04] <didgereedoodah> oh man it's this quest
[2:22:14] <DatAsuna> This one's good
[2:22:16] <Solidus_113> in the beginning of the factory, yeah
[2:22:19] <+badmr7> This was fun, later woolie
[2:22:23] <alrobot2014> its a fun one
[2:22:26] <startstoprepeat> oh, this is that quest that liam had you go to the factory for but that you never accepted
[2:22:26] <Josef_Stryker> Hello people
[2:22:27] <+VidulaSaix> You never finished this
[2:22:29] <DatAsuna> Yeah it's new
[2:22:31] <Josef_Stryker> So how did Woolie like the DMC demo?
[2:22:33] <grayjammer> You never finished this one yeah
[2:22:34] <Futurecity10> You never finished this one
[2:22:45] <spacecatstreams> oh hey this is a good video game
[2:22:46] <Zepik> anything you've started but not finished is probably reset
[2:22:47] <+VidulaSaix> You started this one in the LP but didnt get to finish it @WoolieVersus
[2:22:51] <Josef_Stryker> Welp looks like Woolie has his work cut out for him LUL
[2:22:55] <+JayEarly> @critfumble_ are you using FAR?
[2:23:06] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus any quest you didnt finish gets reset
[2:23:08] <Futurecity10> We already saw the text but okay
[2:23:21] <Emdhad> just unlocked GHARUNEFU as a spirit in ultimate
[2:23:24] <+critfumble_> @JayEarly i tried that it installed correctly but didnt fix my issue
[2:23:29] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Also dont over think this, quest clean up is super easy
[2:23:31] <+JayEarly> ah
[2:23:34] <grayjammer> Yea i remember people being mad you didnt finish this one lol
[2:23:46] <+JayEarly> Man I regret waiting for the PC port
[2:23:58] <Zepik> don't worry, if a quest completes fully it doesn't come up again so you don't have to worry about repeating something
[2:24:06] <+critfumble_> on start up just before the main menu the game kinda "hitches" and the screen goes black, the games running and i can interact with the menu but it just isnt displaying
[2:24:08] <Solidus_113> you saw it during route A, but Liam told you to go to the place too soon and the item wasn't there
[2:24:25] <startstoprepeat> it's the song from the music video, yeah
[2:24:44] <alrobot2014> it took me until route C to find the jukebox
[2:24:50] <PhantomMaskJr> 2B for Smash klinkHyper cybgButt
[2:25:11] <DatAsuna> Ran well on my PC, plus hacking let me do stuff debug unfortunately didn't
[2:25:11] <Solidus_113> 2B's already in Soul Cal
[2:25:19] <Klefth> Eh. The PC port does run and look better, really.
[2:25:22] <alrobot2014> i waited all the way until the xbox port like a scrub
[2:25:25] <+D2_Synua> The PC port is so bad
[2:25:27] <grayjammer> i was ok with the PC, but i can get how its intolerable for many
[2:25:27] <DatAsuna> Like I felt OP at level 100 so I cheatengined my attack stat LOWER lol
[2:25:38] <+critfumble_> atleast there wont be an unfixable display bug that stops you from ever playing the game on ps4 ;_;
[2:25:43] <didgereedoodah> PC has a save editor which is great
[2:25:43] <+Harawanagangsta> I hate how RDR2 is being held off
[2:25:44] <+Pnutz_> PC port is ok, but some people have issues with certain hardware
[2:25:47] <+JayEarly> @Klefth I mean it does, but the problems man
[2:25:51] <didgereedoodah> don't have to grind for level 8 chips
[2:25:51] <+Pnutz_> I had no issues
[2:25:52] <Futurecity10> Pc port = Nude 2B
[2:25:58] <DatAsuna> It depends on what you're using, yeah
[2:26:02] <Klefth> I never really ran into any issues with it. What actually happened with it?
[2:26:06] <Futurecity10> kurobaBreakTime
[2:26:09] <PhantomMaskJr> @solidus_113 so more android booty to go around
[2:26:10] <+D2_Synua> Square Enix will literally never patch Nier on PC
[2:26:15] <DatAsuna> Some people had resolution issues with borderless fulscreen
[2:26:16] <+Harawanagangsta> Consoles are awful
[2:26:28] <+Pnutz_> @Klefth never got patched, some people get crashes, and some have no issues like me
[2:26:31] <Solidus_113> Surprising the Automata port was so poor, Revengance and Transformers Devastation ran great
[2:26:34] <DatAsuna> The PS4 port has many frame rate issue too tbh
[2:26:36] <+critfumble_> another radical concept to japan: update and fix your fucking game i bought full price
[2:26:37] <EnderGamma> How do you feel about maxing out your no stagger chips?
[2:26:38] <didgereedoodah> AMD cards just didn't work at launch
[2:26:38] <+VietcongSamurai> PC mod fixed all the issues for me; granted shouldn't rely on that. But it did fix it
[2:26:40] <+Codeblue666> thats why steam refund is a thing
[2:26:41] <DatAsuna> This game is almost never 60FPS on PS4
[2:26:43] <Klefth> @Pnutz_ Issues like?
[2:26:44] <JoeNeutrino> But consoles are at least simple
[2:26:45] <+D2_Synua> My experience with Automata would be way better if I had gotten the PS4 version
[2:26:48] <+JayEarly> @Klefth For me I couldn't get it to run in 1080p without a fix
[2:27:02] <+critfumble_> cant refund the error only happened 20 hours in
[2:27:04] <MelBrooksKA> Woolie, I don't have money for every single console, I have a PC
[2:27:04] <+zanzibar_junker> oh woolie should stream devastation
[2:27:07] <Klefth> Weird, I played it at 1440p all the way without a problem
[2:27:08] <+JayEarly> it would run in like 1600 x 900 or something
[2:27:15] <+Harawanagangsta> maybe 10 years ago, yea theres definitely reasons to get something on a console as opposed to the PC version. But basically everything is better for PC.
[2:27:17] <itsya_boi_gappy> Pc is kinda a pain and action game son key-bored is scrub stuff
[2:27:18] <Solidus_113> @zanzibar_junker you mean that game that doesn't exist anymore?
[2:27:21] <Solidus_113> you can't buy it
[2:27:23] <+Pnutz_> @Klefth mostly crashing with certain hardware. It also has a fixed resolution, but that's an easy fix with the community mods.
[2:27:30] <+DatLatinoGuy> just buy a PS4 and you're good
[2:27:47] <+zanzibar_junker> soundtrack is so good too
[2:27:50] <DatAsuna> @itsya_boi_gappy that's why you use a gamepad on PC lol
[2:27:59] <+DatLatinoGuy> Switch if you're into PC ports of indies
[2:28:05] <+HRDSalami654> The biggest problem with the PC port was that it was unstable. It was fine for some, and for others it was unplayable.
[2:28:06] <+critfumble_> "just buy a very expensive box" man i have ¬£35 right now
[2:28:07] <+Big_Dream> have you blew your self up on the space station yet of tried to remove your os chip @WoolieVersus
[2:28:16] <+VietcongSamurai> The FAR mod could help fix the game is you're having issues with the game.
[2:28:20] <+zanzibar_junker> I bought it on ps3 and grabbed it for free on ps4
[2:28:23] <grayjammer> The problem with PC is that it downscaled and upscaled its resolution simultaneously, which made it look.... weird.
[2:28:23] <itsya_boi_gappy> @DatAsuna tru but pads are like the price of a game sometimes and im cheap LUL
[2:28:23] <AdrianBauer> my PC is trash for anything but photoshop and visual studio. I didn't have a problem with the pc port but it was a slideshow above 720p/ medium quality
[2:28:32] <topendbuzz> "is better on pc but when its not"
[2:28:33] <+zanzibar_junker> before it got yanked
[2:28:44] <DatAsuna> PC also lets me do rebalances, for stuff like this where the game gets unfun easy
[2:28:53] <JoeNeutrino> What is you're a moron like me who can never make PC games work properly?
[2:28:55] <+Harawanagangsta> even mid tier PCs
[2:28:56] <DatAsuna> Also combos are hard to do when you ill everything in 5 hits lol
[2:29:08] <DatAsuna> And debug mode enemies take no damage isn't what I want
[2:29:14] <+zanzibar_junker> i can still download it too
[2:29:22] <+JayEarly> I think my biggest issue with this game is the difficulty Normal is too easy, Hard is too much
[2:29:28] <+Harawanagangsta> I dont mind waiting to play RDR2 online till the PC version comes out because the online will be FREE
[2:29:35] <MelBrooksKA> Woolie, you waited a years before you started playing this game anyways
[2:29:40] <tfei42> needs more A2
[2:29:41] <Emdhad> @jayearly doesn't hard take away lock on?
[2:29:43] <didgereedoodah> Hard mode is wack
[2:29:44] <grayjammer> Fixing him requires a shit-ton of zone reloads
[2:29:47] <Edible_Enthusiasm> OH. this is live. and without liam xD Hello Woolz & chat
[2:29:50] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Engals is a shared quest
[2:29:58] <+Batvision> god dammit woolie just run
[2:30:01] <itsya_boi_gappy> That i will agree with I hate paying for online on console games man
[2:30:06] <+zanzibar_junker> ah fuck i'm downloading it again
[2:30:09] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus IIRC this one is the very first room you start in
[2:30:11] <+Batvision> it's just as stylish
[2:30:17] <+JayEarly> @Emdhad yeah, but my problem is that you can take like 2 hits before dying
[2:30:18] <Klefth> I don't even buy consoles these days out of principle. Can't see myself supporting companies that charge you for p2p matchmaking. That's scummy as fuck.
[2:30:19] <tfei42> Lack of lock-on isn't that bad
[2:30:23] <DatAsuna> Engels is the big boy
[2:30:24] <Zepik> Engels is big boy
[2:30:29] <+Pnutz_> big robo in the field
[2:30:30] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Engels is the name of the robot, you need to repair. But if you chapter select it resets
[2:30:30] <DatAsuna> jinx
[2:30:32] <+mcjimbo12> engels is the demo boss in the field
[2:30:33] <Klefth> Engels is the big broken boy
[2:30:34] <JoeNeutrino> The factory robot.
[2:30:37] <gameaholic42> Big robot
[2:30:39] <+Big_Dream> did he fight emil yet
[2:30:43] <Zepik> :X
[2:30:43] <DatAsuna> nope
[2:30:47] <Emdhad> Big robot you played rock em sock em with
[2:30:51] <DatAsuna> Emil is for with Liam
[2:30:57] <Futurecity10> Emil is liam only
[2:30:58] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I think hes the big robot with the giant round drill weapons
[2:31:08] <startstoprepeat> literally first room you set foot in
[2:31:14] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus first room of the game
[2:31:15] <Solidus_113> yeah, the item is at the very first room in the game
[2:31:15] <startstoprepeat> after the shmup
[2:31:18] <Futurecity10> Just like with pat, I have to be super precise with my help
[2:31:20] <didgereedoodah> its the first room you start in
[2:31:27] <Emdhad> can't spell liam without most of the letter from emil
[2:31:27] <didgereedoodah> at the beginning of the game
[2:31:29] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus remember where you started the game
[2:31:38] <Zepik> first room you control 2B, where you fight the first saw arm mini boss
[2:31:38] <+mcjimbo12> it's the far side of the factory
[2:31:42] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus First room in the game, the big round place
[2:31:49] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus its in the first room of the game
[2:31:50] <gameaholic42> Back at the very beginning under some debris
[2:31:50] <Klefth> It's all the way to the beginning area @WoolieVersus
[2:32:03] <Solidus_113> sipsipDab sipsipDab
[2:32:05] <alrobot2014> YES
[2:32:09] <OkamiDude15> yes
[2:32:11] <+D2_Synua> apatDab
[2:32:14] <Klefth> Yup, all the way to the start of the game
[2:32:15] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus don't forget the hidden shortcut in this room to get back to the start faster
[2:32:29] <Klefth> There is a shortcut, though
[2:32:31] <+D2_Synua> Can we get a dab Woolie apatDab
[2:32:34] <Emdhad> if its the girls body its in the room where you first fight that big blade thing and 9s shows up in his flight unit forbthe first time
[2:32:47] <DatAsuna> !Shortcut at risk!
[2:32:51] <Flameking> yeah make sure to take the shortcut here
[2:32:53] <alrobot2014> FORGET NOT THINE SHORTCUT
[2:32:59] <didgereedoodah> missed the shortcut
[2:33:01] <Klefth> Well, there it goes LUL
[2:33:04] <DatAsuna> MISSED SHORTCUT RIP
[2:33:06] <PhantomMaskJr> Pat and Paige subs doodGlare1 doodStare doodGlare2
[2:33:15] <Emdhad> This is literally my perfect sequel
[2:33:25] <Solidus_113> Max subs sipsipHonk
[2:33:28] <dbgt5551> Well its kinda like how p4 does stuff even after p3
[2:33:33] <DatAsuna> I would kil for nier remake with playable Kaine in route B
[2:33:35] <+mcjimbo12> @WoolieVersus Where do you stand on Nier Automata being the best game ever made? Gun to my head I think it might be, for me
[2:33:47] <OkamiDude15> octoFRE subs
[2:33:54] <Klefth> You sure you don't wanna adjust Nines' behavior? LUL
[2:34:08] <supersugoisenpai1> I watched someone do the final arena battle with A2 and crush it. Made me want to start playing again
[2:34:41] <tfei42> was it donguri?
[2:34:41] <Klefth> Thats a tad hyperbolic, but it is a sick ass game
[2:34:41] <alrobot2014> shortcut part 2 coming up
[2:34:42] <DatAsuna> Ending E is real special
[2:34:53] <T_Sasquatch> I think nier automata is a solid 9/10
[2:34:58] <+Pnutz_> I love the game, but its flawed
[2:35:08] <+JayEarly> what are those Emil heads doing here?
[2:35:10] <alrobot2014> 8/10- no map on mooseback
[2:35:12] <Solidus_113> Ending E is something that only works because NieR is a video game, and that's what makes it special
[2:35:13] <spacecatstreams> there is no best game ever
[2:35:15] <Zepik> I'm sure the LP was really good for your channel but looking back now are you happy with the choice to record it or would you have rather played it off screen in a shorter time frame?
[2:35:17] <+WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> It's like "best film ever made" it just doesn't work
[2:35:17] <+Pnutz_> personally i find leveling to be pointless
[2:35:18] <itsya_boi_gappy> he was just playing the demo of the best game ever made LUL Kappa
[2:35:20] <alrobot2014> that's a shortcut right there
[2:35:20] <+WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> There's too many genres
[2:35:22] <+Pnutz_> in this game
[2:35:25] <+zanzibar_junker> That's a stretch for any game
[2:35:25] <T_Sasquatch> best game ever made is TETRIS. ARGUE WITH ME
[2:35:26] <+AlwaysHuffer> Its one of the most unique games ever made and thats enough on its own
[2:35:29] <+mcjimbo12> Sure, that's fair. I just think the things it *does* with the video game format (ending E especially) are so unique
[2:35:30] <OkamiDude15> everything has flaws realistically so there can never truly be a 10/10
[2:35:42] <grayjammer> "Best game" feels VERY VERY reductive
[2:35:42] <spacecatstreams> i would say its expertly paced (unless you dislike 9s)
[2:35:48] <Mrbaconator> i think that's pretentious there are absolutely 10 out of 10s
[2:35:48] <JoeNeutrino> There are too many games to pick just one unless it's Metal Gear Solid 2. Kappa
[2:35:51] <Emdhad> @t_sasquatch tetris effect is lighting me up right now so I'll agree with you
[2:36:08] <T_Sasquatch> TETRIS is timeless and flawless
[2:36:15] <PhantomMaskJr> The Town With No Name is the greatest video game ever made doodExcite
[2:36:18] <Solidus_113> Nier's got text adventure in it LUL
[2:36:24] <+zanzibar_junker> Front Mission 3 is better than FFT
[2:36:29] <JoeNeutrino> 10/10 doesn't mean perfect. If no game can ever be given a 10, why even have a scale that goes up to 10?
[2:36:41] <KaiserMario> @supersugoisenpai1 There isn't a way to measure these things, but if it's what's in your heart, then sure...
[2:36:46] <Mrbaconator> 10 is for a game that excels in all areas
[2:36:52] <T_Sasquatch> @joeneutrino fez is a 10 :)
[2:36:58] <Mrbaconator> you an still have flaws but yer god like in all areas
[2:36:58] <FenixSeraph> I love the Jin-Roh outfit
[2:36:59] <+Batvision> Tetris is a 10
[2:37:01] <Ropcord> remember, someone out there thinks Super Seducer 2 is the best game ever made
[2:37:04] <DatAsuna> OH I FORGOT THIS GAVE THAT
[2:37:04] <Mrbaconator> tetris is a fucking 10
[2:37:05] <+Pnutz_> its almost like scores are based on opinions 4Head
[2:37:12] <tfei42> 10 if whatever the person giving rating wants it to mean
[2:37:24] <T_Sasquatch> but I wouldn't say fez is the greatest game of all time but I think it's a 10
[2:37:24] <+D2_Synua> Scores are so subjective that my 10/10 doesn't equal what someone else thinks a 10/10 is
[2:37:27] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus pick it up
[2:37:35] <Enz0ned> how long has he been playing nier
[2:37:47] <Bncbck> remember that some people think the guy game is the best game ever made
[2:37:48] <alrobot2014> about 30 minutes
[2:37:50] <+Harawanagangsta> Shadow of the Colossus is best game
[2:37:50] <+YabbaTroll> is there any sort of !docket command here?
[2:37:52] <b1gboss007> no story
[2:37:53] <ECRead> yo Woolz, just poppin in to say hi
[2:38:14] <Emdhad> I always say favourite instead of best though
[2:38:14] <+zanzibar_junker> Chicken nuggets are the perfect food
[2:38:18] <+Pnutz_> NO, Breath of the Wild is perfect and you cant change my mind Kappa
[2:38:24] <+drewdrew89> @WoolieVersus did you get down on the dmc 5 demo
[2:38:25] <alrobot2014> touch her body
[2:38:28] <T_Sasquatch> realistically it's impossible to say the best game ever created because there's no time frame or criteria
[2:38:32] <Emdhad> like my favourite series is hajime no ippo
[2:38:36] <startstoprepeat> !BLIND!
[2:38:39] <Solidus_113> NieR Automata is a top-tier video game, along with Okami, Resident Evil 4, and Dark Souls sipsipHellmo
[2:38:41] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus Inspect the debris where the body is
[2:38:45] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus touch her
[2:38:46] <+mcjimbo12> T_Sasquatch for sure
[2:38:47] <tfei42> here we go
[2:38:49] <KaiserMario> Man, people who always go to tetris for perfect game argument get on my nerves... that's like saying the wheel is humanity's greatest invention... Like, yeah... sure you won, can you shut up now...
[2:38:51] <grayjammer> Its a sword sticking out of a rock
[2:38:53] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus its literally that rock in the back
[2:38:54] <Emdhad> luckily for me it's also the best
[2:38:57] <Emdhad> fight me
[2:39:01] <T_Sasquatch> X and O's is the greatest game if all time Kappa
[2:39:40] <+JayEarly> I never used the fist weapons because they looked too goofy
[2:39:41] <EnderGamma> Woolie ever consider a second spoilercast with Pat now that you've beaten the game? maybe on wooliewillfigureitout?
[2:40:06] <jase__x> b
[2:40:08] <+zanzibar_junker> Wwwoooooff
[2:40:09] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus remember when a bunch of squadmates got blown up at the start of the game
[2:40:10] <jase__x> m
[2:40:16] <DatAsuna> This CANNOT continue
[2:40:19] <tfei42> i would like that, but Pat probably forgot stuff
[2:40:21] <+mcjimbo12> holy shit i never noticed she said this can't continue LUL
[2:40:37] <DatAsuna> The B stands for Buh=bye
[2:40:43] <+Jingai_Jigokumoto> cheer1
[2:40:44] <+DatLatinoGuy> rip 11B
[2:40:53] <alrobot2014> ITS THE ACTUAL FIRST MINUTE OF THE GAME
[2:40:58] <+JayEarly> @mcjimbo12 huh
[2:41:04] <JoeNeutrino> @DatAsuna Or bail
[2:41:05] <grayjammer> Logic Viruses have been around since the Yorha stageplay
[2:41:10] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus What? No. She just got corrupted by the logic virus
[2:41:29] <startstoprepeat> the hint at 2E there is amazing
[2:41:30] <+mcjimbo12> @JayEarly Machines say this cannot continue, desperate Yorha units say this cannot continue, there's probably something there
[2:41:36] <DatAsuna> 11Back Down
[2:41:37] <topendbuzz> games are weird, as art it's odd to say this is the best art ever made but games are also a product that you use, So comparing and giving game a number out of 10 is somting that kinda needs to be done.
[2:42:43] <+mcjimbo12> oh yeah @WoolieVersus and chat did you know that when it's showing all the squadmember names in the very opening sequence, there's another E unit in the squad (7E maybe?) which hints at the 2E reveal, since a regular 2B unit wouldn't know that the E units even exist
[2:42:59] <+d00msdaydan> 2
[2:43:01] <startstoprepeat> you're right, woolz
[2:43:03] <ECRead> I'm with Woolz
[2:43:14] <+zanzibar_junker> Oh man they should have put the yorha armor in SC6. The female customize options are lacking
[2:43:14] <JoeNeutrino> I look forward to you watching Clemp's Nier Automata videos.
[2:43:17] <Graxe_> She was going to run, and then may or may not have gotten infected. Whatever the case, the file is called "11B's Escape Plan".
[2:43:17] <alrobot2014> continuing the quest will reveal the answer to all those questions
[2:43:21] <+Big_Dream> 2b is actaully 2e
[2:43:27] <Emdhad> 11B more like 11 FLEE
[2:43:29] <+enickma11> Its pretty clear that the infection only comes after the massive damage she took
[2:43:45] <+JayEarly> I wonder if the "No Emotions" thing is an E model thing
[2:43:46] <DatAsuna> Ya missed the shortcut twice RIP
[2:43:58] <+mcjimbo12> @JayEarly It probably should be, considering their job
[2:43:58] <startstoprepeat> yorha become deviant after an emotional shock
[2:43:59] <Zepik> the virus has been around for a long time, it comes up a bunch during the Peal Harbor mission reports where A2 (then Number 2) and her comrades meet Anemone and the others
[2:44:05] <MarylandJutsu> @JayEarly well due to their work KILLING fellow Yorha, it would make sense
[2:44:10] <tfei42> I dont know why but when I see yorha armor without helmet, I think of robot sewage worker. Don't know why.
[2:44:10] <+Batvision> BUILT TO DIE WORLD IS A FUCK
[2:44:16] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It's something you would pick up on more likely in route B after the E unit reveal among the resistance
[2:44:17] <+JayEarly> No other Yorha unit really follows that rule
[2:44:22] <+Arkfyre> @JayEarly I think it's a 2B thing
[2:44:22] <themightyseptopus> how was the dmc demo
[2:44:24] <EnderGamma> It's been a hot minute since the factory
[2:44:29] <bursky00> Yeah the no emotion thing is definitely a E only thing.
[2:44:30] <EnderGamma> And the factory changes a bit
[2:44:36] <MarylandJutsu> MEMORIES AT RISK
[2:44:39] <OkamiDude15> @JayEarly i feel like its more of a personal thing with 2b since she has to keep killing 9s over and over again she just doesnt want to get attached
[2:44:40] <grayjammer> I only know the factory layout BECAUSE of this sidequest lol
[2:44:54] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus no problem on the shortcut it only saves about 2 minutes tops
[2:44:56] <+mcjimbo12> @DatAsuna But you don't see the squadnames in route B, you literally only see it at the start of a fresh save file
[2:45:09] <Emdhad> no one's actually upset woolie it's just funny to expose any type of balls on stream
[2:45:14] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus shortcut and others like it are hidden under platforms in fixed camera areas
[2:45:23] <+Pnutz_> @bursky00 ya the i think the whole point of 2B not showing emotion is so she wouldn't get too attached to 9S when she had to kill him
[2:45:25] <+mcjimbo12> I love replaying games and seeing all the foreshadowing that now seems SUPER obvious
[2:45:33] <EnderGamma> This is kinda a machine HQ so
[2:45:34] <alrobot2014> transporters are in the later parts of the factory
[2:45:40] <EnderGamma> It'd be hard to have them inside the facility
[2:46:02] <didgereedoodah> @WoolieVersus there's a 9S-only sidequest that shows you were the shortcut is
[2:46:06] <DatAsuna> vending machnes are life
[2:46:08] <startstoprepeat> do these even work as teleporters this early in the story
[2:46:13] <startstoprepeat> nope!
[2:46:21] <Futurecity10> DO NOT CHAPTER SELECT
[2:46:26] <Zepik> no you have to run to the camp
[2:46:26] <alrobot2014> yeah that's another reason
[2:46:31] <+mcjimbo12> you can only go bunker from resistance camp
[2:46:31] <OkamiDude15> not in this one woopsKek
[2:46:37] <didgereedoodah> only from resistance camp
[2:46:37] <topendbuzz> not yet
[2:46:39] <B_ikki> you can go to the bunker through the one at the camp
[2:46:40] <Futurecity10> Remember, transports only after the second eve fight
[2:46:42] <DatAsuna> Yup
[2:46:42] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus transport doesn't happen this early in the story
[2:46:42] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus only from camp
[2:46:51] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus only after the aliens
[2:46:52] <Flameking> its early game, transport doesn't exist yet
[2:46:53] <grayjammer> thats not great
[2:46:57] <Zepik> until fast travel is unlocked the camp is the only connection to the bunker
[2:47:04] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus boar or moose? go
[2:47:13] <bursky00> @Pnutz_ Yeah it always weirded me out when 2B keep saying emotions are prohibited when every other android we meet says otherwise.
[2:47:15] <+JayEarly> you only get quick travel right before the first fight with Adam and Eve
[2:47:18] <alrobot2014> thankfully friend moose is always around
[2:47:30] <B_ikki> hacking reality
[2:47:35] <AdrianBauer> Royal mounted canadian yaksmen
[2:47:36] <EnderGamma> This is legit one of my fav tracks
[2:47:38] <alrobot2014> HACKERMAN
[2:47:38] <+mcjimbo12> 9S is Tricking oh shit
[2:47:39] <startstoprepeat> @JayEarly after the second fight, actually
[2:47:40] <EnderGamma> City Ruins is the shit
[2:47:50] <topendbuzz> woolie is really a Canadian riding his stand
[2:47:51] <+JayEarly> Friendship ended with 9S Now Moose is my Best Friend
[2:47:54] <tfei42> brother bear mooses
[2:47:54] <OkamiDude15> @EnderGamma as liam would say "its the best track in the game"
[2:48:00] <DedlokPM> Best song in the game here. sbfpLiam
[2:48:09] <EnderGamma> He says that for every track lmao
[2:48:11] <+JayEarly> this soundtrack even makes a moose majestic
[2:48:14] <OkamiDude15> exactly woopsKek
[2:48:28] <alrobot2014> i hate how the pod leap autotargets moose friend
[2:48:29] <EnderGamma> But I legit actually like City Ruins a lot
[2:48:33] <+mcjimbo12> This track is my go-to "strolling in the rain" music
[2:48:34] <OkamiDude15> its super good
[2:48:36] <DedlokPM> @EnderGamma And it's true every time. sbfpLiam
[2:48:43] <Ropcord> D:
[2:48:43] <+bonzosan> the distortion on this track make me uncomfortable
[2:49:03] <OkamiDude15> especially with emil's shop theme which is THE BEST SONG IN THE GAME sfhWOKE
[2:49:10] <alrobot2014> the music is so good that as soon as the fishing prompt came up i instant pressed that shit
[2:49:14] <bathoi> EVERY DAYS A SALE
[2:49:22] <FenixSeraph> tru dat
[2:49:28] <alrobot2014> EVERY SALE'S A WIN
[2:49:31] <reiju_22> remember when emils music ruined the devola popla scene BibleThump
[2:49:37] <MarylandJutsu> LA ALALALALALALLLLLLAAAAA
[2:49:38] <+Big_Dream> i love how this game story is about and endless cycle of pointless hate and war over something that doesn't even matter anymore
[2:49:48] <grayjammer> BUY IT NOW OR KICK YOURSELF LATER
[2:49:50] <+mcjimbo12> Emil will NEVER let Devola and Popola know peace
[2:49:52] <topendbuzz> oops
[2:49:54] <+mcjimbo12> NO FORGIVENESS
[2:50:05] <Solidus_113> YOU WON'T BELIEVE, HOW MUCH YOU CAN SAVE~
[2:50:06] <+zanzibar_junker> You should play yakuza games woolie
[2:50:12] <brambobelurkin> WE NIER NOW BOIZ
[2:50:25] <DatAsuna> Good sword
[2:50:31] <+zanzibar_junker> Kamuro is a good small space
[2:50:47] <OkamiDude15> i fucking hate emil so much for ruining that moment for me woopsKek
[2:50:53] <+JayEarly> At the Pax East Nier anniversary panel they had a sing-along to the Emil theme that was fun
[2:50:58] <grayjammer> I love 16D's dialogue for the Truth
[2:51:15] <+WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> fareehaEvil Serves her right
[2:51:17] <alrobot2014> and there you have it folks
[2:51:19] <+Big_Dream> wow the turn
[2:51:32] <OkamiDude15> best song in the game right here sfhMON sfhKAS
[2:51:33] <+JayEarly> well this took a turn
[2:51:37] <Josef_Stryker> Well then
[2:51:39] <+mcjimbo12> this is fine
[2:51:42] <+enickma11> Its such a 180 in tone from the lie
[2:51:48] <topendbuzz> oof
[2:51:52] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus if you choose not to tell her about the plan to desert, she decides to go out to fight to the death to get revenge so you're screwed either way!
[2:51:53] <Josef_Stryker> I always withheld the truth. But oof
[2:52:06] <EnderGamma> I have no idea what the lie dialogue is
[2:52:13] <+Superkbrown95> woolie, how excited were you to see the Joker smash announcement?
[2:52:18] <Who_lio42> Speaking of grim, did you see the Paz sticker in Smash?
[2:52:18] <topendbuzz> t90Fine
[2:52:28] <+Pnutz_> no1FINE
[2:52:31] <DatAsuna> Wooie endorses abuse confirmed
[2:52:35] <Emdhad> If you heard the lie you'd be able to tell how much is coping
[2:52:41] <+enickma11> If you lie to her she tells you that they were dating so there's a romance element at play
[2:52:43] <alrobot2014> there's a paz sticker?
[2:52:49] <+chaumiester> Have you started grinding chips yet? Fastest way to lose your mind in this game. Also to became OP as hell
[2:52:50] <OkamiDude15> @Who_lio42 dude that spirit is super fucked woopsLUL
[2:52:53] <Flameking> Hey @WoolieVersus if youre willling to deviate a bit there is a really cool unique enemy that appears in the forest kingdom in route C if you care to fight it, just thought you should know if you havent seen it yet.
[2:52:56] <alrobot2014> like the idol of peace on the box sticker?
[2:53:01] <Who_lio42> its a spirit. its super fucked up
[2:53:07] <DatAsuna> Ur welcome :P
[2:53:14] <itsya_boi_gappy> LUL add it to the list
[2:53:18] <+JayEarly> @alrobot2014 Yep Gives you a bob-omb
[2:53:19] <brambobelurkin> LUL
[2:53:20] <EnderGamma> YouTube comments so stronk
[2:53:20] <grayjammer> Judging by the defensive chips, I'd say that it's true that she was abused, and knowing that her mentor wasn't a hero allowed her to accept it.
[2:53:21] <+critfumble_> its a nice bus tbf
[2:53:22] <MarylandJutsu> FAir, the Woolie Bus is BIG
[2:53:25] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus mid chapter 7 is probably your best bet for clearing up other side quests. most are accessible and fast travel's unlocked.
[2:53:26] <didgereedoodah> SAVE
[2:53:27] <+critfumble_> roomy
[2:53:30] <alrobot2014> THAT'S FUCKED UP @JayEarly
[2:53:34] <+Proxzo> Have you tried smash yet woolie?
[2:53:38] <DatAsuna> Oh go that thing
[2:53:38] <topendbuzz> woolie is the tyres on the bus
[2:53:42] <+mcjimbo12> where my #fethe13000 at
[2:53:44] <Solidus_113> you ever learned to read? Kappa
[2:53:47] <T_Sasquatch> wait what
[2:53:58] <+captain_history> if you lie in this quest you see the whole picture of the story
[2:54:00] <bursky00> Did Woolie finished the couple side quest?
[2:54:01] <grayjammer> @mcjimbo12 WE HERE
[2:54:02] <alrobot2014> I still remember the ground zeroes bomb scene
[2:54:04] <MarylandJutsu> #fethe13000
[2:54:07] <DatAsuna> The channel is built on woolie abuse
[2:54:09] <Graxe_> If it's Godzilla, he fought one in the DLC. If it's not, then I dunno what it is.
[2:54:10] <AdrianBauer> someday you'll be so powerful you can lift that bus into space
[2:54:11] <brambobelurkin> the FE13000 wasnt it 10000?
[2:54:22] <topendbuzz> woolie was born under the bus
[2:54:30] <+Superkbrown95> tbh I started to watch the channel after you joined, took me a while to realize you and Liam weren't first there :p
[2:54:36] <OkamiDude15> naw its the 13K
[2:54:37] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus the channel exists due to two things, woolie abuse, and woolie turning down a kirby video lol
[2:54:41] <Flameking> oh he fought godzilla, i hadnt caught up with the lp, ignore what i said then.
[2:54:42] <itsya_boi_gappy> and that one time you killed a guy and the one time you stole a pie @WoolieVersus
[2:54:43] <Deadpool2450> I thought Liam came in as the anime guy
[2:54:44] <MarylandJutsu> GRANT US LORE! GRANT US LOOOORREE
[2:54:46] <+chaumiester> There are like... 3... maybe 4 enemies that are almost nearly impossible to find. But needed to 100% the enemy list
[2:54:49] <DeathByGeek> Pretty much LUL
[2:54:49] <DatAsuna> The glue that holds it together
[2:54:51] <cervidaequus> Milk/vents pusher liam
[2:54:53] <T_Sasquatch> literal lies
[2:54:56] <OkamiDude15> gun jumper liam
[2:55:00] <+DatLatinoGuy> LUL
[2:55:01] <Emdhad> @brambobelurkin if you were part of the #FE13000 then you'd know the answer to that
[2:55:02] <DatAsuna> Lies about being a liar
[2:55:10] <FenixSeraph> how would you know if you can't read LUL
[2:55:11] <grayjammer> Oh man I was around for the birth of the Liam Milk lore
[2:55:12] <+PapiHentai> Pie stealer?
[2:55:14] <alrobot2014> i thought it was #13000FE
[2:55:20] <+zanzibar_junker> Woolie sounds like an LOGH character now
[2:55:23] <+PapiHentai> You killed a man!
[2:55:24] <Who_lio42> NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THAT
[2:55:29] <jase__x> huh I always wondered why you were called woolie the liar
[2:55:35] <DatAsuna> Nonono
[2:55:36] <Deadpool2450> woolie especially hates small cats
[2:55:38] <OkamiDude15> @zanzibar_junker he basically is one
[2:55:39] <DatAsuna> Woolie killed a human
[2:55:43] <brambobelurkin> I dont remember for the life of me. I remember the 10 minute speech for it though lol.
[2:55:43] <+AlwaysHuffer> I still cant forget that time he killed that one guy
[2:55:44] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus can't read, steals pies, plays mahvel, lives in garbage, that one time you killed that guy
[2:55:44] <DatAsuna> wh he considers an animal
[2:55:47] <DatAsuna> for a jetpack
[2:55:47] <alrobot2014> this is right after the intro of adam
[2:55:50] <+chaumiester> Actually, have you fought Emil yet?
[2:55:50] <topendbuzz> Woolie killed a guy!?!?!??!?!?!??!
[2:55:51] <+zanzibar_junker> Miracle Woolie
[2:55:52] <MarylandJutsu> SOOOO GOOOOODD
[2:55:55] <grayjammer> Best son in the game
[2:55:58] <bursky00> Woolie the lier spreading lies again
[2:55:59] <+SuichiTanaka> The best song in the game.
[2:56:00] <OkamiDude15> BEST SONG IN THE GAME sfhWOKE
[2:56:11] <cervidaequus> Pat beats women and abuses children, matts a babyfur, woolie kills animals and steals objects. OG LORE
[2:56:15] <antthefool> Bless the desert theme
[2:56:15] <BioStormX> Did you watch that Nier concert yet with all those live performances
[2:56:15] <+bonzosan> @WoolieVersus you think your lore would be different if you showed up on epic yarn?
[2:56:18] <alrobot2014> this is the song that makes me want to fish in the oilfield
[2:56:22] <Ropcord> o o f
[2:56:42] <+Batvision> I feel like the rumors of you being stinky and living in a hole must have hurt
[2:56:53] <OkamiDude15> woopsD woolie you killed a child? AMAZING! EXCELLENT WORK! that right there is why you're the best woolz woopsEZ
[2:56:55] <grayjammer> The moment you actively told everyone that you abhor liars became the point where I stopped finding the Woolie Memes funny
[2:57:01] <Ropcord> one of the best songs in the game Kappa
[2:57:02] <juxtest> So Woolie didn't really kill that guy by suplexing a dog onto him?
[2:57:05] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Don't worry, the pedophile pat stuff will never disappear from google
[2:57:17] <LukeSkynoober> POWER BALLAD!! What a good freaking term!
[2:57:19] <Ropcord> Kappa is the face i imagine liam making like 70% of the time
[2:57:22] <Klefth> Have a good rest of stream Woolz, chat enbSup
[2:57:23] <Emdhad> Nier always finds a way to make fire gibberish songs
[2:57:30] <alrobot2014> seeya @Klefth
[2:57:47] <FenixSeraph> Confederate Pat and Alt Right Paige have you topped
[2:57:48] <alrobot2014> bunker might be it for the 21O quest
[2:58:00] <+chaumiester> There is a quest that is easily missable that is hidden on the bunker
[2:58:07] <time_axis> it reinforces my opinion that lyrics don't matter
[2:58:10] <+critfumble_> good ol boy pat
[2:58:15] <alrobot2014> Nier and ZOE for the gibberish
[2:58:25] <DatAsuna> Could be the box pushing quest?
[2:58:35] <+PapiHentai> After this past Saturday morning scrublords video... the image of all you guys has changed...as FBI fugitives
[2:58:37] <OkamiDude15> you dont need to understand a song to know if its good or not
[2:58:39] <alrobot2014> i think box pushing is later
[2:58:44] <FenixSeraph> you'd love Yuki Kajiura then
[2:58:49] <SleepyMaribo> working on side Quests Woolie?
[2:58:57] <alrobot2014> yep
[2:58:57] <+JayEarly> @time_axis Devil Trigger's lyrics are DUMB but that don't mean they don't make me hype as fuck
[2:59:09] <+chaumiester> The most easily missable quest is the side quest given by the Commander on the Bunker
[2:59:19] <alrobot2014> oh yeah
[2:59:21] <antthefool> THE MOOSE BRINGER
[2:59:25] <Ropcord> the new smash theme is about a hundred times better without the lyrics
[2:59:30] <time_axis> everyone always thinks that
[2:59:37] <grayjammer> If you say "continue fighting" the next quest is straight to the amusement park
[2:59:37] <+critfumble_> you complete young sidequests woolie?
[2:59:41] <SleepyMaribo> theres 2 of em
[2:59:44] <alrobot2014> there are 2 box pushing quests
[2:59:47] <DatAsuna> There's 3 box pushing quests
[2:59:48] <alrobot2014> then there's a third
[2:59:51] <Emdhad> i like the world of light lyrics
[2:59:51] <didgereedoodah> there's 3 box pushing quests
[2:59:55] <Flameking> you should chapter select to after the hole appears in city ruins, it'll make it easier find quests.
[2:59:56] <OkamiDude15> there are 3
[3:00:07] <Emdhad> reminds me of a Saturday morning cartoon
[3:00:14] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus you know that arena shaped area on the building next to father servo
[3:00:18] <+SWindleFeD> @WoolieVersus are they even able to hurt you at this point?
[3:00:32] <Emdhad> I'm also am odd one because i love the code lyoko theme
[3:00:35] <grayjammer> "Rock a Moose" is a fun phrase
[3:00:42] <BalloniWright> man did I lost woolie playing dmc5? BibleThump
[3:00:46] <SleepyMaribo> anyway, night Woolie.
[3:00:46] <alrobot2014> that's a box pushing quest
[3:00:48] <+VantomPayne> yeyeye
[3:00:51] <OkamiDude15> @BalloniWright yup
[3:00:58] <+chaumiester> That's an A2 box pushing quest though
[3:01:01] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus that's a box pushing quest for a2
[3:01:04] <Futurecity10> Thats A2 only
[3:01:05] <Zepik> i believe that's a C quest for A2
[3:01:06] <+JayEarly> A moose running at full bore would probably destroy a robot
[3:01:07] <time_axis> I think another quest that starts somewhere else directs you there
[3:01:17] <+JayEarly> so that's realistic
[3:01:25] <chserafi> Hey @WoolieVersus, been a big fan since my friend showed me the SBFC in college. Good luck in streaming! Also, tell Pat he is wrong, but I agree.
[3:01:26] <didgereedoodah> I love the operator quests
[3:01:32] <bursky00> The DMC5 Demo is so short and I think was set on baby mode.
[3:01:38] <Emdhad> @jayearly but would it destroy a robot moose also running at it
[3:01:58] <xenfernox> You have to do box sorting #2 before the near father servo
[3:01:59] <+JayEarly> is this 9S's dlc costume?
[3:01:59] <+chaumiester> There is also a 10 minute sidequest given by the Commander that is super easy to miss
[3:02:24] <+bonzosan> yeah dlc costume
[3:02:41] <alrobot2014> the commander quest is given at the same time as the 6O quest
[3:02:57] <+JayEarly> wait is 9S's costume supposed to be Kid Nier?
[3:02:59] <DatAsuna> @JayEarly yeah DLC
[3:03:05] <DatAsuna> Young Nier outfit
[3:03:06] <OkamiDude15> @JayEarly yeah
[3:03:07] <grayjammer> I love some of the "Accept Quest"/"Decline Quest" options in this game
[3:03:07] <Louie_Salmon> The refusal option for sidequests are usually pretty funny
[3:03:18] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus this is the quest that explicitly shows you the shortcut
[3:03:25] <b1gboss007> is to trick the normies
[3:03:25] <gyrogogozeppeli> wait, is Woolie doing the sidequests he missed?
[3:03:28] <OkamiDude15> the demo is hard locked to easy mode/human
[3:03:36] <DatAsuna> yeah sidequest stream
[3:03:43] <alrobot2014> yep @gyrogogozeppeli except for the emil quest
[3:03:47] <gyrogogozeppeli> ah
[3:03:53] <+chaumiester> Lets be honest though, Nier Automata is Great. I went back and replayed Nier. Story was good... Game was a solid 6.5/10
[3:04:15] <alrobot2014> only if you explored or looked for visual hints
[3:04:15] <DatAsuna> Nah you found it in the LP
[3:04:20] <alrobot2014> LUL
[3:04:39] <Emdhad> @chaumiester yeah the combat was frustrating sometimes in the original nier
[3:04:41] <alrobot2014> i accidentally ran in there and got confused on my playthrough
[3:04:42] <chserafi> Is it just me, or does Woolie
[3:04:46] <+JayEarly> The original Nier is a very rough game
[3:04:48] <chserafi> 's audio sound quite?*
[3:04:48] <+Big_Dream> emil the only remaining human technically
[3:04:49] <+chaumiester> Though you can really see Yoko Taro's writing style in Nier.... especially since he himself said. There was no good ending... only bad
[3:04:54] <OkamiDude15> og nier was real rough
[3:04:56] <+JayEarly> it's a particular flavor of Japan jank
[3:05:03] <Zepik> shortcut just cuts out some of the middle of the factory. only useful for sidequests really
[3:05:11] <time_axis> sounds fine to me
[3:05:17] <DatAsuna> Audio's fine for me, but I am listening on headphones
[3:05:18] <topendbuzz> nah its fine
[3:05:21] <didgereedoodah> sound is fine for me
[3:05:24] <+JayEarly> sounds fine
[3:05:29] <chserafi> Alright, may just be me. Thanks
[3:05:29] <DedlokPM> fine for me as well
[3:05:31] <alrobot2014> its the only time you could use the shortcut
[3:05:40] <blacksoap65> @WoolieVersus where does Hellsing rank on your favorite anime list?
[3:05:40] <artoflec> compared to other streams its quiet but ill just crank it down afterward
[3:05:42] <alrobot2014> all normal quests take you nowhere near the shortcut
[3:05:58] <alrobot2014> his boyshorts
[3:06:05] <DatAsuna> Onier is way inferior to papa nier
[3:06:06] <+critfumble_> its probably the lift that i never opened before my game broke irreversibly
[3:06:12] <antthefool> His little feets
[3:06:23] <alrobot2014> timeskip nier's outfit looks amazing
[3:06:32] <OkamiDude15> post time skip brother nier is RAD
[3:06:33] <+chaumiester> Boy, that was confusing when I saw those 2 Nier games came out, Replicant and Gestault
[3:06:35] <DatAsuna> Don't you lve grown ass man going "you and I are friends now"?
[3:06:38] <+JayEarly> I like Papa Nier's eyepatch tho
[3:06:40] <time_axis> theres something weird about papa nier giving friendship speeches to Kaine
[3:06:49] <Emdhad> i really wanted some type of romance between kaine and timeskip young nier
[3:06:51] <alrobot2014> the shortcut is about to come up
[3:06:52] <+critfumble_> hellsing is fine
[3:06:53] <DatAsuna> I prefer the aspect of him being a fake widower
[3:07:02] <alrobot2014> this room right here
[3:07:02] <Zepik> yeah they could have tried a little harder with papa nier post timeskip. Like even give him a new outfit, hell even the second outfit bro-Nier gets
[3:07:13] <alrobot2014> this room
[3:07:16] <OkamiDude15> @Emdhad theres a doujin out there for that my friend sfhSMUG
[3:07:16] <didgereedoodah> you passed it
[3:07:20] <alrobot2014> turn back
[3:07:25] <sosuke5> Hellsing ultimate though...
[3:07:27] <OkamiDude15> go back woolie
[3:07:33] <blacksoap65> @WoolieVersus Did you ever watch the Ultimate?
[3:07:42] <+chaumiester> Nah, that's all Papa Yoko Taro, he wanted an ugly dad protagonist
[3:07:51] <+JayEarly> I thought there was a romantic thing between Nier and Kaine
[3:08:02] <DatAsuna> There was
[3:08:18] <alrobot2014> the door to the right is the shortcut
[3:08:20] <Emdhad> @okamidude15 is it tagged as yaoi though Kappa
[3:08:31] <bursky00> I forgot that the original Hellsing anime existed, except for the amazing opening song.
[3:08:42] <+JayEarly> Now that I think about it the scenes with Kaine are kind of weird with papa Nier
[3:08:48] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus there's another one closer to the beginning
[3:08:48] <+critfumble_> the song is basically the only thing worth remembering imo
[3:08:50] <DatAsuna> Emil has a gay crush on nier and Kaine has a futa dick that's bigger than yours, both of these things are canon.
[3:08:51] <OkamiDude15> @Emdhad maybe it is maybe it isnt you'll just have to find out for yourself Kappa
[3:09:08] <Emdhad> @jayearly there were implications but I wanted something more concrete
[3:09:08] <sosuke5> Why does Woolie always watch the older versions of things?
[3:09:13] <CerberusDriver> so did woolie like the demo
[3:09:15] <+chaumiester> Oh yeah, Emil was super gay. I forgot about that
[3:09:20] <EnderGamma> God I love 21O
[3:09:36] <DatAsuna> Emil Being gay faired a lot better int ranslation than Kaine being intersex
[3:09:38] <Ropcord> haHAA
[3:09:56] <artoflec> LUL
[3:10:00] <Zepik> the "romance" scene with Kaine wasn't too bad with papa nier, the only weird/cringey one was when she almost dies the first time and papa nier tells her "Yes! You and I are friends now!"
[3:10:00] <antthefool> PAY UP
[3:10:02] <+VietcongSamurai> Reward?! Jebaited
[3:10:06] <alrobot2014> i hate when my mom hangs up on me
[3:10:07] <+JayEarly> Damn son
[3:10:09] <DatAsuna> 8-4 dropped the ball on that one, led a lot of people to think she was excluded because of tyran despite it the story before that happens
[3:10:38] <brambobelurkin> @zepik LUL we are friends! Leme smash
[3:10:38] <alrobot2014> also you're going in the wrong direction to get out of here @WoolieVersus
[3:11:27] <Emdhad> Woolie versus games he hasn't played in a while
[3:11:30] <alrobot2014> happens to me 3/5 times
[3:11:56] <grayjammer> Also the map being upside-down doesnt help
[3:11:58] <+JayEarly> I remember that the original game mentioning that the villagers thought Kaine was a "freak" but not explaining why explicitly
[3:12:03] <OkamiDude15> woolie versus sense of direction Kappa
[3:12:11] <Emdhad> it's the most confusing layout so don't worry about it
[3:12:22] <alrobot2014> oh you jinxed that hard
[3:12:30] <DatAsuna> Japanese makes it very clear, but english dances around it
[3:12:32] <time_axis> thats probably why Liam kept you away from there
[3:12:37] <b1gboss007> yeah, only in the factory
[3:12:48] <+critfumble_> inbox friend
[3:12:49] <alrobot2014> wait was the searching for clues on a2 main story stuff
[3:12:53] <bursky00> No worries Woolie I also have horrible sense of direction and haven't properly learned left and right till my adulthood.
[3:13:05] <Flameking> you can get the reward right now its in your mail.
[3:13:07] <grayjammer> @alrobot2014 Nppe just a sidequest
[3:13:21] <alrobot2014> oh then we'll be going back to the factory again
[3:13:49] <grayjammer> In My Horny Opinion
[3:13:58] <+reluctant_monkey> KILL
[3:14:05] <DedlokPM> KILL HIM FOR ITS MEAT! rooH
[3:14:05] <+Lutherian90> I'm calling PETA
[3:14:06] <Pajex_> D:
[3:14:09] <+Solidnick18> Jebaited
[3:14:10] <grayjammer> IM IN
[3:14:15] <DedlokPM> EAT DA MEAT rooVV
[3:14:16] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Whatthe
[3:14:24] <+DatLatinoGuy> rip
[3:14:26] <alrobot2014> yeah 21O and 6O give their rewards in the mail
[3:14:27] <Emdhad> Can't hack hin digitally so i guess you'll have to hack and slash
[3:14:29] <Captain_Joe1911> notekFeels
[3:14:29] <Zepik> yeah it's almost a blessing to just assume Kaine was ostracized for the shade since if you were paying enough attention to realize she was being called a freak before she got Tyrann you don't really get a clear in-game explanation for it
[3:14:31] <+critfumble_> woolie this isnt helping the hating animals bit, we just talked about this
[3:14:35] <DatAsuna> RIP
[3:14:37] <+reluctant_monkey> BloodTrail BloodTrail
[3:14:38] <cervidaequus> Kill the white ones, yeah!
[3:14:40] <DatAsuna> Woolie confirming the lore
[3:14:45] <DatAsuna> The race war starts now
[3:14:46] <topendbuzz> woolie is fan of white meat
[3:14:48] <MelBrooksKA> You can't hack a moose, but you could haka moose
[3:14:52] <grayjammer> #WhiteMooseGenocide
[3:14:55] <OkamiDude15> woolie killing WHITE ANIMALS? more at 11
[3:14:59] <KnivesEve> kill albinos for that white meat
[3:15:16] <didgereedoodah> make sure to do the second part of the quest
[3:15:21] <+PushSTARTtoSean> woollie is a big boy
[3:15:26] <alrobot2014> there's another 21O quest after this one
[3:15:29] <startstoprepeat> whoa whoa whoa
[3:15:35] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus there's a part 2 of it
[3:15:49] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus part 2 of the quest
[3:15:52] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus You're not done with data analysis
[3:15:57] <OkamiDude15> your not done yet
[3:16:35] <topendbuzz> ?
[3:16:36] <alrobot2014> part 2 comes later
[3:16:42] <PhantomMaskJr> Capcom needs to make a 3D Strider game in the vain of MGSR doodStrider
[3:16:56] <xenfernox> Its convoluted
[3:17:02] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus it's just after walking around a bit
[3:17:08] <Zepik> i think she just contacts you while you're running around
[3:17:08] <alrobot2014> probably wasting your time
[3:17:14] <+critfumble_> time is convoluted on the moon
[3:17:17] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus You need to travel to another part of the map
[3:17:17] <grayjammer> I dont know. I usually do these quests after the Hole in the City
[3:17:17] <BobcatGat> part 2 later
[3:17:20] <alrobot2014> its been a few days since i did this route
[3:17:29] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus when you go to the overworld, 21O will contact you with part 2
[3:17:29] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus She'll call you with part 2 after you do a zone transition
[3:17:31] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus It activates once you leave the hub
[3:17:31] <alrobot2014> so i may forget things
[3:17:36] <+trevin3dimensions> do donations work boss?
[3:17:36] <Screamlord_Bonerhitler> I‚Äôm pretty sure you have to leave the camp to trigger more dialogue
[3:17:40] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus You need a zone transition
[3:17:44] <+Demirose41> yoyoyo
[3:17:53] <Zepik> go run around outside the camp for a min and see if it shows up
[3:18:09] <NotaMachine> Where is Clemps when you need him ciraLewd
[3:18:12] <DatAsuna> Also, every day's a sale
[3:18:16] <alrobot2014> petting his cat
[3:18:32] <DatAsuna> Remember: Pat hit pascal after wandering couple
[3:18:33] <alrobot2014> or editing crisis core who knows
[3:18:36] <DatAsuna> Pat's a monster
[3:18:46] <OkamiDude15> clemps is too busy fighting dark clemps in castle oblivion
[3:18:48] <Zepik> wandering couple is a good one
[3:19:00] <Emdhad> Woolie, gun to your head Outkast vs NWA WHO BETTER?
[3:19:02] <alrobot2014> i love and hate wandering couple
[3:19:10] <startstoprepeat> okay, that's weird...
[3:19:15] <DatAsuna> I love wondering couple too
[3:19:25] <Zepik> head over to the bridge, if it doesn't pop theres a save point
[3:19:28] <OkamiDude15> wandering couple is pretty fucked
[3:19:30] <startstoprepeat> my bad, i guess, apologies
[3:19:35] <grayjammer> Oh well
[3:19:40] <DatAsuna> Since it's split in 2 ihe'll probably get the trigger even with a reset anyways
[3:19:51] <alrobot2014> i missed the second stage of wandering couple the first route because i couldn't find the flooded city
[3:19:59] <alrobot2014> before the main quest area
[3:20:12] <DatAsuna> Anything after adam and eve is teleport
[3:20:19] <Zepik> @DatAsuna you;re probably right, a few quests do persist through skips, like speed star and servo I believe
[3:21:07] <+Tonku_the_Red> The D Line Kappa Kappa
[3:21:08] <topendbuzz> @WoolieVersus any plans to stream transistor?
[3:21:11] <brambobelurkin> @WoolieVersus Hell Yeah played guard and tackle
[3:21:11] <alrobot2014> speaking of wandering couple the quest trigger for it is after the introduction to pascal @WoolieVersus
[3:21:13] <@Commando_Joe> Whoa whoa whoa. Slow down with the technical foot ball terms.
[3:21:23] <+critfumble_> omg id love a transistor stream
[3:21:39] <JDebss> Love you Woolz!
[3:21:56] <grayjammer> Wandering couple doesn't persist, even though you cant access the second half until the hole appears
[3:21:57] <DatAsuna> gotta get worse before it gets better
[3:22:02] <T_Sasquatch> loooool
[3:22:03] <antthefool> ^^^
[3:22:15] <Emdhad> like plague said "failure is not an end"
[3:22:28] <alrobot2014> @grayjammer wait so he'd have to follow through on main quest or start it after the hole?
[3:22:38] <DatAsuna> The path to success is paved with failure
[3:22:43] <grayjammer> @alrobot2014 Yes he'd have to start after the hole
[3:22:45] <PhantomMaskJr> @commando_joe wwtv7
[3:22:48] <@Commando_Joe> Oh, ok. Thanks.
[3:22:48] <antthefool> God I adore the amusement park
[3:22:49] <alrobot2014> okay thanks
[3:22:53] <+bonzosan> oh no sport
[3:22:54] <topendbuzz> so you where a qb Kappa
[3:23:05] <JDebss> Keep up the great work!
[3:23:07] <T_Sasquatch> AND thats when you killed that guy
[3:23:15] <alrobot2014> thank god you're around, that'd have been a travesty
[3:23:20] <sosuke5> You need to rise before you fall
[3:23:26] <DatAsuna> Play football long enough andwho doesn't kill a guy?
[3:23:26] <Youknowwhyimhere008> SourPls
[3:23:29] <Louie_Salmon> This song not being played at the 2017 game awards is a tragedy
[3:23:36] <antthefool> ^
[3:23:41] <DatAsuna> Concussion is no joke
[3:23:48] <alrobot2014> i accidentally murdered all of these machines while trying to practice my combos
[3:23:49] <+blazymaniac> woolie can you just stand on those stairs for like 5 minutes?
[3:23:56] <DatAsuna> Game awards snubbed nier so hard that year lol
[3:23:57] <time_axis> this is still my favorite song in the game
[3:24:01] <DatAsuna> Even when you win, you lose
[3:24:08] <NotaMachine> Insert better Wooile joke here
[3:24:15] <itsya_boi_gappy> LUL
[3:24:18] <+DatLatinoGuy> LUL
[3:24:19] <Pajex_> yay!
[3:24:25] <+blazymaniac> thanks! my fav song in the game!
[3:24:27] <Emdhad> @louie_salmon I understand not having vocals because learning the gibberish would be tough but i can't believe there were no instrumental versions either
[3:24:35] <Graxe_> Isn't the gibberish language intentionally supposed to sound French but is total nonsense? Or is it just Emi Evans' version of Weight of the World?
[3:24:36] <alrobot2014> always need time to appreciate the good of teh world
[3:24:51] <MisterGrowing> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:24:51] <grayjammer> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:24:55] <Louie_Salmon> It's sorta french, german, and japanese
[3:24:57] <+VietcongSamurai> Confetti PogChamp
[3:25:06] <antthefool> My favorite song in the game
[3:25:18] <DatAsuna> Emi Evans does chaos language to sound foreign to any language
[3:25:25] <+chaumiester> Hey Woolie, did you fight the Rabbit?
[3:25:28] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus have you already gotten your 2b ass staring trophy?
[3:25:32] <Josef_Stryker> This was one of my favourite moments in the game.
[3:25:35] <xenfernox> Did you watch the concert/ stage play for this game?
[3:25:40] <Emdhad> YES
[3:25:42] <time_axis> no I really don't
[3:25:43] <+HRDSalami654> Totally.
[3:25:44] <Youknowwhyimhere008> yes atpRtsd1
[3:25:45] <+VantomPayne> YES
[3:25:47] <+bonzosan> all the time
[3:25:49] <grayjammer> yes
[3:25:51] <Who_lio42> sucks I cant appreciate this games music, it somehow just all blends together to me.
[3:25:54] <+blazymaniac> yes, i try and fail to sing the songs a lot
[3:25:56] <+JayEarly> Remember that video of Yoko Taro being salty that the composer was getting all the awards?
[3:25:59] <NotaMachine> ciraLewd
[3:25:59] <admiral_of_crunch> Totally
[3:26:03] <+ApocalypticExpress> just watched today's Episode of Gridman. Holy SHit so Good
[3:26:06] <alrobot2014> you don't need to self destruct
[3:26:06] <EnderGamma> Don't even have to SD
[3:26:09] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus I learned the lyrics to Song of the Ancients last week because I couldn't get the tune out of my head
[3:26:09] <+Pnutz_> nah just look at her ass
[3:26:10] <EnderGamma> Just look at it
[3:26:10] <+chaumiester> Yoko Taro baby. Let's make up a language... Hell, lets make 5
[3:26:12] <RunningNGunning> I mean I do that already with songs that Im noi sure what the words are for normal songs
[3:26:14] <alrobot2014> you just tilt it real low
[3:26:19] <Graxe_> @WoolieVersus Where does Emil's theme rank on your list of Nier themes?
[3:26:24] <+VantomPayne> for some people its really not that different from trying to sing an anime song with romaji lyric
[3:26:25] <PhantomMaskJr> asiMonka cybgButt I got mines
[3:26:31] <+chaumiester> You basically described all Japanese Music to me....
[3:26:34] <DatAsuna> AH, home
[3:26:39] <bursky00> I do that with any song really.
[3:26:49] <antthefool> The unreleased Emil theme tho
[3:26:51] <DatAsuna> @Graxe_ ask him again after ending Y
[3:26:53] <antthefool> Whoocha
[3:26:53] <+JayEarly> @chaumiester I want to say that was the vocalist that came up with that
[3:26:55] <+JayEarly> or the composer
[3:27:07] <admiral_of_crunch> It help that there are transcriptions out there of the lyrics, just y'know, without any actual meaning.
[3:27:13] <Louie_Salmon> @who_lio42 The amusement park theme specifically is incredibly unique. Nothing sounds like that
[3:27:32] <+chaumiester> @JayEarly He created Chaos the Language of Nier?
[3:27:32] <alrobot2014> i personally rank the somber quest completion music as second only to Kaine's theme
[3:27:34] <grayjammer> @antthefool BIG MOOD
[3:27:36] <PhantomMaskJr> Become as God‚Äôs is my favorite theme in the game
[3:27:36] <Emdhad> song of the ancients is correct
[3:27:37] <DatAsuna> It's song of the ancients yeah
[3:27:42] <sosuke5> *sounds of Woolie trying to remember things*
[3:27:46] <admiral_of_crunch> Oh hey, Woolie, have you listened to the arranged soundtracks yet? For Automata AND Gestalt/Replicant.
[3:27:51] <+bonzosan> when you really think about it, every language is just sounds, which is no different from nier's multiple languages
[3:28:03] <+chaumiester> Emil's Shop Theme, in English is pretty awesome all things considered
[3:28:11] <alrobot2014> oh yeah what quest are we even going to
[3:28:14] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus I forget, did Liam tell you the ending E credits includes the dev team doing the chorus version when you accept help?
[3:28:18] <Emdhad> The final mix of weight of the world is so damn good
[3:28:22] <+Big_Dream> Emil the last human kinda
[3:28:29] <Who_lio42> @Louie_Salmon hmm ok. Ill listen for it again.
[3:28:55] <xenfernox> The nier concert was good
[3:29:10] <DatAsuna> Also it gave us great 2B violin art
[3:29:11] <Emdhad> @xenfernox anywhere I could watch that?
[3:29:18] <NME_Dom> YO YO YO
[3:29:20] <admiral_of_crunch> The devs are totally supporting you in you killing them.
[3:29:21] <xenfernox> You tube
[3:29:24] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie should stream watching the stage play
[3:29:27] <RunningNGunning> I love the flooded city theme
[3:29:29] <Solidus_113> Birth of a Wish
[3:29:31] <DatAsuna> I have a big bias for Kaine's theme
[3:29:31] <Emdhad> much obliged
[3:29:33] <xenfernox> Seach the 1080p one
[3:29:38] <alrobot2014> you mean this song right here
[3:29:42] <+Solidnick18> i like all the songs for the most part
[3:29:45] <+chaumiester> Ah god, lets not get into the confusing discussion of Replicant vs Gesaults if we have to figure out if Emil is possibly the last human
[3:29:48] <+QueequegTheater> This is the best song in the game
[3:29:56] <admiral_of_crunch> Any love for End of the Unknown? Adam boss fight theme
[3:29:57] <NME_Dom> whats good
[3:30:04] <time_axis> might have just partially done it
[3:30:04] <+JayEarly> Isn't Emil a weapon?
[3:30:04] <DatAsuna> Kain√© [Salvation] is just <3
[3:30:09] <antthefool> Word
[3:30:14] <startstoprepeat> i still find myself whistling temple of drifting sands from time to time
[3:30:27] <alrobot2014> best song name is totally Grandma [Destruction}
[3:30:28] <DatAsuna> Was the last human
[3:30:36] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus In back
[3:30:47] <+chaumiester> Emil is an experimented on Replicant turn weapon.... I think
[3:30:48] <Louie_Salmon> Let's just call it a draw and say that every song on the OST is the best song in the game
[3:30:50] <DatAsuna> HEY COOL COAT
[3:30:55] <DatAsuna> WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
[3:30:59] <RunningNGunning> THE WHOLE TIME
[3:31:05] <+QueequegTheater> Man, fuck DMD Griffon
[3:31:10] <antthefool> @louie_salmon I‚Äôm with it
[3:31:15] <alrobot2014> but emil was around before the gestalt project was he not?
[3:31:28] <Graxe_> Emil was born in like the early 2000s.
[3:31:37] <Graxe_> Or late 90s. One of them.
[3:31:39] <alrobot2014> oh are we box pushing?
[3:31:40] <+chaumiester> I don't remember
[3:31:46] <DatAsuna> oh this
[3:31:57] <alrobot2014> oh this quest
[3:32:00] <startstoprepeat> oh, this one's really good
[3:32:22] <+DreyfussFrost> Oh hey Woolie, did you ever manage to get the Forest King guard to respawn?
[3:32:28] <alrobot2014> makes me feel sad about it
[3:32:34] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus this is the shared one
[3:32:49] <admiral_of_crunch> Back when I was 100% Gestalt, it was just about the end of summer and I was grinding out the farming trophies (for anyone who's familiar, you know how it goes). I fell asleep on the couch to Devola's version of the town theme so many times I lost count. Now every time I hear it I get sleepy. Love that song.
[3:33:13] <+king_wragles> mmmm, on the one hand Woolie is streaming
[3:33:21] <+king_wragles> on the other hand... automata spoilers
[3:33:41] <admiral_of_crunch> (Hide from the spoilers)
[3:33:46] <DatAsuna> I have that with the Tales of Symphonia Search a Seal theme
[3:33:48] <+bonzosan> yeah
[3:33:49] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus What about Majula?
[3:33:51] <+king_wragles> Nah, supporting Woolie is the hill I will die on
[3:33:52] <Emdhad> i get sleepy when i hear beneath the mask
[3:33:57] <+Arkfyre> Majula theme is still top tier
[3:34:01] <+Solidnick18> it floods the brain and sooths the soul good time
[3:34:02] <itsya_boi_gappy> LUL relax gohan
[3:34:06] <+QueequegTheater> Fucker was that adult Gohan
[3:34:09] <alrobot2014> are we doing edrugs
[3:34:12] <time_axis> she doesn't
[3:34:14] <DatAsuna> jackass was the real hero all along
[3:34:15] <itsya_boi_gappy> and ryu
[3:34:20] <grayjammer> she doesnt
[3:34:22] <DatAsuna> Oh man the nexus tho
[3:34:25] <alrobot2014> EDRUGS TIME
[3:34:28] <+Solidnick18> i love you jackass
[3:34:32] <sedrictheironic> She finds out at the end
[3:34:33] <+QueequegTheater> DS2 > DS3, Lucatiel > Solaire, don't @ me
[3:34:39] <DatAsuna> Demon's Souls is a special level of comfy theme
[3:34:39] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus jackass doesn't know everything, she just got the data after a2 destroyed the tower
[3:34:43] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus She only finds when you take down the tower at the end
[3:34:47] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus ITS E-DRUGS FIGHT TIME
[3:34:51] <Flameking> you didn't finish it
[3:35:04] <sedrictheironic> but she is just as clueless about it all as you
[3:35:07] <Solidus_113> i think he finished it off camera
[3:35:11] <alrobot2014> i love petting the pod
[3:35:12] <DatAsuna> Pod demands pets
[3:35:14] <admiral_of_crunch> Jackass only knows everything post-ending C/D/E, you get her letter as a postscript, but she doesn't know whenever you head back to quest in the postgame.
[3:35:14] <DedlokPM> YOU CAN PET THE PODS? rooAww
[3:35:24] <Graxe_> Oh this quest.
[3:35:27] <+Solidnick18> Science PogChamp
[3:35:29] <startstoprepeat> rip
[3:35:32] <RunningNGunning> rip that bot
[3:35:32] <+QueequegTheater> I hope he stocked up on volt salves
[3:35:33] <Flameking> this will be easy to do
[3:35:33] <RunningNGunning> F
[3:35:34] <+king_wragles> (I actually feel like Woolie is too far in the story for me to understand the acutal spoilers anyhow.)
[3:35:34] <+Solidnick18> oh
[3:35:36] <DedlokPM> THISCANNOTCONTINUE
[3:35:37] <Emdhad> RIP
[3:35:42] <PhantomMaskJr> doodChamp
[3:35:54] <alrobot2014> @king_wragles some chapter titles are spoilers
[3:35:58] <Emdhad> one hit wonder over here
[3:36:00] <PhantomMaskJr> Yay my song asiHYPERS
[3:36:05] <time_axis> I think the final challenge was too hard
[3:36:06] <alrobot2014> @king_wragles like some are barefaced spoilers
[3:36:07] <+Solidnick18> you did do abit of it and then left it for later
[3:36:09] <DatAsuna> my jam
[3:36:19] <startstoprepeat> gg
[3:36:22] <DatAsuna> lvl99 helps
[3:36:23] <+enickma11> Lvl 99 LUL
[3:36:30] <grayjammer> M E L T E D
[3:36:35] <+Solidnick18> what a breeze
[3:36:35] <Emdhad> melting robots faster than that factory
[3:36:43] <+QueequegTheater> @time_axis just pop a volt salve and the shields aren't a problem
[3:36:43] <DatAsuna> Jackass is just Hange
[3:37:02] <time_axis> I just meant too hard for woolie at the time, so he had to come back later
[3:37:02] <xenfernox> Yea this was diffrent at lvl 15
[3:37:02] <+QueequegTheater> I NEED MORE POWER
[3:37:10] <grayjammer> KNOWLEGE IS POWER
[3:37:15] <bursky00> FOR SCIENCE
[3:37:19] <Mendin> whoever said lucatiel > solaire didn't play ds2 during the first few months when her hp was a lot lower and her ai was absolute garbage
[3:37:39] <+king_wragles> @alrobot2014 good thing I'm actually playing Smash atm. I will attempt to dodge them, but I accept the flaws of my plan. tvm
[3:37:39] <+QueequegTheater> @Mendin I'm not talking about her combat
[3:37:47] <+QueequegTheater> Better representation of the Darksign
[3:37:52] <alrobot2014> is this the definition of Fightfucking?
[3:38:03] <Mendin> too bad that's tainted any thought of her in my mind
[3:38:04] <RunningNGunning> Thats not human evolution, thats ALL evolution
[3:38:09] <sedrictheironic> Survive.
[3:38:10] <bursky00> It's just the nature of living things.
[3:38:13] <DatAsuna> It's all chemicals man
[3:38:22] <sedrictheironic> Pass on Genes.
[3:38:23] <admiral_of_crunch> This quest is actually super relevant to the main plot and character motivations because it reveals that the Yorha androids literally get off on violence (like you do from fun gameplay), which informs some late-game stuff.
[3:38:23] <+QueequegTheater> @Mendin If it helps, you could watch her solo Smelter now
[3:38:26] <sedrictheironic> Repeat
[3:38:26] <+king_wragles> @WoolieVersus but the chemicals in my brain tell me your voice is real, so....
[3:38:31] <Graxe_> Which brings up the question at this point: Does 9S wanting to kill 2B just his way of showing his love toward her?
[3:38:32] <brambobelurkin> They do it for the nooky
[3:38:34] <+Jv9ufxcy> Don't say Guinea Pig! Say test Tube! Kappa
[3:38:42] <Graxe_> Or is 9S just crazy?
[3:38:54] <Emdhad> crazy in love
[3:38:55] <+king_wragles> Ya! I don't see gorillas making ANIME!
[3:38:59] <+daveronald> isaac newton died a vergin
[3:39:04] <DatAsuna> I dunno man, there's that lizard that can run on water
[3:39:07] <RunningNGunning> When the dolphins show up with jet packs youll be eating your words woolie
[3:39:07] <+Solidnick18> yeyeye
[3:39:09] <+QueequegTheater> Holy shit she's a shadow clone
[3:39:09] <grayjammer> We're also the sweatiest animal on the planet
[3:39:11] <+bonzosan> We are the only ones who got katanas and fedoras
[3:39:12] <+KaizenChaos> What about octopus'?
[3:39:18] <time_axis> like in YuGiOh GX?
[3:39:27] <Mendin> @queequegtheater I watched her fall into lava between her summon sign and smelters fogdoor.
[3:39:31] <PhantomMaskJr> Woolie and his damn jet pack doodStare
[3:39:31] <DatAsuna> It's just chemicals!
[3:39:34] <DedlokPM> that speed of that blade program is just so goofy. I love it
[3:39:36] <@Commando_Joe> Yeah, but like...in 200 years will we still be around with our jet packs? I dunno. But sure as shit cockroaches are still gonna be around. crendorThink
[3:39:40] <Graxe_> Yay, you helped Jackass make drugs.
[3:39:47] <Graxe_> Good job.
[3:39:53] <+wardenofwinter> Robo drugs lol
[3:39:53] <+JayEarly> Yay Science!
[3:39:59] <admiral_of_crunch> Hell yeah get high
[3:39:59] <+king_wragles> That's right, he's a "chemist"
[3:40:02] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus BIG DRUGS
[3:40:02] <RunningNGunning> Stay in drugs, don't do school
[3:40:06] <Mendin> i summoned her, walked into the fight, and she DIED before getting in there
[3:40:08] <+Pnutz_> I think you can find some high android now
[3:40:09] <startstoprepeat> i think if you zone out and in again, it'll pop it
[3:40:12] <alrobot2014> yes she is the original drug dealer for the androids out in the oil field @WoolieVersus
[3:40:14] <antthefool> Jackassenberg
[3:40:15] <+QueequegTheater> @Mendin I never said her AI was great in vanilla. Just that the only white phantom with more HP than her in Scholar is fucking Vengarl
[3:40:16] <+JayEarly> I love robo drugs
[3:40:16] <+Pnutz_> they should be by the oil pond
[3:40:24] <Flameking> yeah
[3:40:27] <+DreyfussFrost> Chapter Select will.
[3:40:28] <+king_wragles> @WoolieVersus MAKE A FUCKING SANDWICH
[3:40:32] <grayjammer> I think its more Zone Transitions than time elapsed
[3:40:38] <RunningNGunning> Probably means just walk far enough away @WoolieVersus
[3:40:40] <+DreyfussFrost> No idea what triggers it, might be unloading and reloading her area.
[3:40:43] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus since Jackass gives me Hange vibes, how did you feel about AoT S3 so far? It's a bit of a shame it's on mid-season break. As a manga reader I'm hype for reactions to the old stuff. lol
[3:40:44] <Graxe_> @WoolieVersus Sometimes, it's leave the general region of the world and come back. I'm not sure about this one.
[3:40:49] <alrobot2014> basically walk away and finish the other quest
[3:41:13] <admiral_of_crunch> Those are always weird objectives for completionists.
[3:41:19] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Try fast travelingto reset ther world state
[3:41:27] <Graxe_> Oh, this machine/
[3:41:37] <DatAsuna> Kill em all
[3:41:38] <grayjammer> If you do this quest early, this guy is a PROPER badass
[3:41:39] <DatAsuna> 1989
[3:41:41] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> I'll never get why the arenas were more compelling content to record for the LP than sidequests
[3:41:50] <RunningNGunning> This litteral plot armor LUL
[3:41:57] <+DreyfussFrost> @DatAsuna I feel you, the last couple years have been an exercise in restraint.
[3:41:58] <alrobot2014> oh so he's scripted to have plot armor
[3:42:01] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie how give bits
[3:42:13] <antthefool> BERSERKER BARRAGE
[3:42:15] <DatAsuna> 9S plz
[3:42:15] <alrobot2014> i fought him around level 25 and wondered why the fuck he was so unkillable
[3:42:21] <Graxe_> The machines were covered in blood, if you didn't see it.
[3:42:25] <+goose_attack_almanac> Yo what's that 2B costume
[3:42:29] <Graxe_> That's how you know they were important.
[3:42:30] <+goose_attack_almanac> She looks super dope
[3:42:34] <DedlokPM> @QueequegTheater wait until he's affiliated or partnered
[3:42:39] <+king_wragles> ... 9S has officially never seen the end to GITS
[3:42:39] <admiral_of_crunch> Far too complex thought for a machine
[3:42:40] <+QueequegTheater> Curses
[3:42:41] <T_Sasquatch> Hahahahahaha I just realized 9s of all people would say that
[3:42:45] <bursky00> Wow 2B
[3:42:52] <antthefool> Yeah that outfit for 2B is the hotness
[3:43:00] <admiral_of_crunch> 9S confirmed to have never played Nier Automata
[3:43:00] <alrobot2014> if he continues streaming with this much regularity he'll get affiliated soon enough
[3:43:03] <@Commando_Joe> You need to be partnered and have the ability to be subbed to I believe @WoolieVersus
[3:43:05] <MisterGrowing> cant unless your partner
[3:43:06] <topendbuzz> 2b is just saying it how it is
[3:43:08] <Graxe_> Did they say when the 2B's coming out in SC6 yet?
[3:43:09] <+chaumiester> Outta Curiosity, why the english voices, just curious
[3:43:09] <+king_wragles> Oh ya, Chat how do we help Woolie make partner?
[3:43:10] <+DreyfussFrost> I think you have to be at least a Twitch Affiliate first.
[3:43:15] <+wardenofwinter> You gotta be partnered
[3:43:19] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus not partnered just affiliated
[3:43:20] <Solidus_113> don't need to be partnered for bits
[3:43:28] <+king_wragles> @WoolieVersus How do partner then?
[3:43:46] <admiral_of_crunch> Woolie literally working for exposure right now.
[3:43:51] <MelBrooksKA> You're probably gonna be subbed really soon
[3:43:53] <MisterGrowing> @king_wragles you just apply if you meet the reqs its on your dashboard when you look at it
[3:43:54] <EnderGamma> Just stream more 4Head
[3:43:58] <@Commando_Joe> There is a link for donations in the description but nothing for bits yet
[3:43:58] <+QueequegTheater> We can do that today
[3:43:59] <T_Sasquatch> @king_wragles it's up to woolie honestly. he can already show he has a twitch channel with multiple allies
[3:44:14] <topendbuzz> yeah
[3:44:21] <T_Sasquatch> I recall pat got Paige her sub button pretty fast
[3:44:27] <+the_phantom_theif> Woolie's streaming more. My life is more fulfilled. apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:44:39] <Emdhad> just play a couple rounds of a fighting game you're feeling up to and you'll be fine
[3:44:42] <+king_wragles> Alright, so chat says (more or less) @WoolieVersus is there but it's time gated [unless I'm wrong which is likely)
[3:44:50] <EnderGamma> Mind you it's easier to stream more when there a game you're heavily interested in
[3:45:03] <Graxe_> If you're schedule is as erratic as you say it is, there might not be a point in having channel subs. Then again, Paige streams only once in a while and managed to have a sub button.
[3:45:07] <+king_wragles> (combining what Woolie said with the actual info I got)
[3:45:13] <RunningNGunning> Just pause and unpause the stream like 50 times EZ stream goal get Kappa
[3:45:20] <alrobot2014> @king_wragles pretty much
[3:45:32] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus its a quest item
[3:45:46] <Graxe_> Like, Matt's cutting down on streaming because he just doesn't have the time, IIRC.
[3:45:47] <Emdhad> how long are you planning to stream for woolie?
[3:45:54] <Emdhad> !uptime
[3:46:03] <T_Sasquatch> he probably needs to make sure he has a schedule because Matt stopped streaming because he felt bad that his subs would rarely see him stream
[3:46:09] <SirBrawler18> Whats up Woolie? Whats the agenda tonight?
[3:46:44] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus right after the alien ship
[3:46:45] <Flameking> i think around chapter 5 or 6
[3:46:54] <+QueequegTheater> It's right after time stop
[3:46:54] <RunningNGunning> @WoolieVersus after the first adam and eve fight in the underground
[3:46:55] <Solidus_113> after the twins and aliens
[3:47:00] <startstoprepeat> chapter 6 onwards
[3:47:04] <admiral_of_crunch> Fast travel unlocks after to fight with the twin
[3:47:05] <+DreyfussFrost> Chapter 6.
[3:47:21] <+QueequegTheater> OOF
[3:47:22] <DatAsuna> Big moose blow
[3:47:30] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus that's also a good place to start the Wandering Couple sidequest
[3:47:40] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus servo arena is A2
[3:47:47] <Flameking> that arena is in route c i believe
[3:47:48] <admiral_of_crunch> Ooh, has Woolie not done wandering couple yet?
[3:47:59] <alrobot2014> no he hasn't
[3:48:07] <admiral_of_crunch> Yum
[3:48:17] <+DreyfussFrost> I don't think there's a single sidequest that you lose after the crater appears.
[3:48:24] <Emdhad> Well it's almost 4am here so I'm out good luck with the rest of the stream
[3:48:25] <DatAsuna> but NEVER an albino moose
[3:48:25] <Graxe_> Does an albino moose run faster than a regular moose?
[3:48:28] <SsHomes> LUL
[3:48:37] <Graxe_> Or is it that their meat sells for more?
[3:48:37] <alrobot2014> you only lose quests after the carrier
[3:48:38] <topendbuzz> ummm
[3:48:42] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie the Master Netori
[3:49:00] <topendbuzz> YEAH I GOT BEEF WITH THAT
[3:49:00] <juxtest> No True Romoose
[3:49:01] <+Deft_Thought> "Sometimes" he says LUL
[3:49:01] <+Batvision> Moosecuckery sounds like a type of cheese
[3:49:02] <admiral_of_crunch> No big deal, Pat's stream exists
[3:49:04] <Intolerable> @WoolieVersus You need to stop
[3:49:07] <+king_wragles> 22:52 Woolie Maden: "Creepy Moose fuckery, it's what we ( @WoolieVersus ) do."
[3:49:28] <Intolerable> @WoolieVersus Moose Cuckery
[3:49:36] <SsHomes> this never goes well
[3:49:40] <Screamlord_Bonerhitler> Has Woolie rubbed the touch pad?
[3:49:40] <+king_wragles> fuck, I can't typ
[3:49:43] <alrobot2014> oh this is another come back later one
[3:49:44] <SirBrawler18> I feel like this game needs to be etched in history with how it plays and the story and GOD this game is excellent.
[3:49:56] <+QueequegTheater> Best song in the game
[3:49:56] <DatAsuna> Yeyeye
[3:49:59] <Pajex_> Kreygasm
[3:50:03] <Ropcord> SourPls
[3:50:05] <alrobot2014> THIS IS THE SECOND BEST SONG IN THE GAME
[3:50:09] <+reluctant_monkey> Happy ending?
[3:50:11] <DatAsuna> Now buy all the trophies
[3:50:11] <alrobot2014> I FISH TO THIS MUSIC
[3:50:15] <@Commando_Joe> Does this game have creepy touch pad rubbing ala Monster Card Girl game on the Vita?
[3:50:18] <+greenfall> sad ending
[3:50:18] <Flameking> walk out of the camp then walk back in to finish this quest
[3:50:23] <Intolerable> French gibberish
[3:50:25] <SirBrawler18> My personal favorite is Pascal's village
[3:50:34] <admiral_of_crunch> Ah, how not-french
[3:50:35] <alrobot2014> @Commando_Joe all touchpad rubbing gives u is petting pods
[3:50:40] <+DreyfussFrost> There kind of is.
[3:50:46] <EnderGamma> I think you can pet your pod
[3:50:47] <SsHomes> she's gonna try to pick a fight with machines and die FeelsBadMan
[3:50:48] <@Commando_Joe> Oh, people in the chat were saying there was something with the touch pad
[3:50:48] <startstoprepeat> there is wholesome touchpad rubbing
[3:50:48] <+DreyfussFrost> Woolie did some touchpad rubbing earlier.
[3:50:49] <+QueequegTheater> What about jiggle lotion
[3:50:54] <+VidulaSaix> You can pet your pod actually
[3:50:56] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Leave and come back and stuff will have happened
[3:50:57] <+greenfall> pet the pod woolz
[3:51:02] <DedlokPM> This here is the best song in the game. sbfpLiam
[3:51:06] <alrobot2014> the touchpad rubbing is awesome here
[3:51:09] <+Deft_Thought> She's just Olga from MGS2
[3:51:16] <+goose_attack_almanac> what is this Touchoad Rubbing?
[3:51:18] <keiji_maede> I have to ask..... Anyone here going to get lostark? o.o
[3:51:18] <SsHomes> that's how it usually ends FeelsBadMan
[3:51:18] <+AlwaysHuffer> No HD rumble either
[3:51:20] <+QueequegTheater> sbfpOmg
[3:51:22] <admiral_of_crunch> Oh, does anyone remember how to use that busted broken camera mode they hid in the game?
[3:51:24] <+DreyfussFrost> But yeah startstoprepeat is right. It's wholesome touchpad rubbing.
[3:51:29] <Intolerable> Those moose are fucking behind your back, @WoolieVersus
[3:51:38] <+QueequegTheater> Best song in the game
[3:51:52] <SsHomes> i knew it
[3:51:53] <DedlokPM> @Intolerable So Moose NTR?
[3:51:58] <SsHomes> Kappa
[3:52:12] <Flameking> woolie check your mail as well, jackass should have sent you something
[3:52:12] <SsHomes> maybe you can find her?
[3:52:13] <+QueequegTheater> Is it still NTR if all three people are NTRing each other
[3:52:13] <alrobot2014> those are some good upgrade materials
[3:52:17] <DatAsuna> yes
[3:52:32] <startstoprepeat> go see jackass and pop some pills.
[3:52:33] <+greenfall> suicide mission end
[3:52:38] <Futurecity10> No, thats the end of her quest
[3:52:40] <startstoprepeat> oh wait, i think you need to check your inbox.
[3:52:42] <Futurecity10> You never see her again
[3:52:44] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus guess what its dark
[3:52:46] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Yeah, it's almost like doing all the sidequests help you get those materials you need, huh?
[3:53:01] <Graxe_> Time to get Jackass' brand of robo-drugs?
[3:53:04] <EnderGamma> Dark? Depressing? What is this a Yoko Taro game?
[3:53:07] <admiral_of_crunch> That WOULD be par for the course, wouldn't it?
[3:53:16] <+Batvision> big moosecucks
[3:53:33] <SirBrawler18> Times like these you gotta sit down and eat some mackerel
[3:53:35] <+DreyfussFrost> Man... this reminds me of something tragic. Someone else I watch had to compulsively complete EVERY sidequest that appeared as soon as it was available, and did like half the sidequests in the game before he unlocked fast travel. Ended up completely burning out on the game by the time he finished route A and asked to be spoiled on the rest to avoid playing it. Try not to be that guy.
[3:53:38] <Kenori> Woolie!
[3:53:39] <DatAsuna> But does the moose balls grow and shrink in the weather?
[3:53:39] <Kenori> Hey boss!
[3:53:43] <+HRDSalami654> FYI, no matter which choice you make the end is the same.
[3:53:43] <time_axis> marathoning all sidequests is going to be a big sad
[3:53:44] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus inbox, i think
[3:53:50] <Graxe_> @WoolieVersus I forget what you guys actually said about it, but what kind of robo-drugs were you expecting from Detroit?
[3:54:05] <+QueequegTheater> "I'll suck this moose's dick for some bioenergy"
[3:54:05] <Ropcord> haHAA
[3:54:08] <grayjammer> Woolie. please
[3:54:11] <alrobot2014> @DreyfussFrost good thing he already finished the game
[3:54:17] <SsHomes> lol
[3:54:20] <alrobot2014> the main story that is
[3:54:34] <+DreyfussFrost> @alrobot2014 I just meant everyone in chat, but yeah.
[3:54:34] <+Superkbrown95> @woolieversus just asking cuz you are a connoisseur of fighting games, did you buy FEXL on Steam?
[3:54:44] <topendbuzz> so not made of drugs?
[3:54:53] <alrobot2014> oh well i already did the same thing, but didn't get burnt out
[3:54:58] <tysmiller> big subtle needles
