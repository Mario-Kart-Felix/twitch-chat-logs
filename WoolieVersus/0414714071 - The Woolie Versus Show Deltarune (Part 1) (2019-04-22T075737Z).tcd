[0:38:00] <sakeydo> Hey chat. I'm going to ask this queastion very carefully...Woolies been very busy and active but I can't help wondering if he will have future guest spots with Matt or Liam. Thoughts? I guess part of me is just curious if these bridges still stand and have become more quiet, private, and casual social connections. Know what I mean.

[0:38:30] <dimwick> the best way to take care of a cactus is to just not touch it most of the time

[0:40:03] <+kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars I'm sure everyone who works at cinnabon would just tell you "this sucks man"
[0:40:04] <tacostarvedbeast> you would be sick of it within 2 weeks

[1:22:09] <%strugglepunk2> Nudealert plays on your expectations of undertale

[1:22:26] <+slaugaus> toilet paper @WoolieVersus
[1:22:29] <$Noponiz> @Lieutenant_America that's not a "best" ending. Thats one ending of multiple
[1:22:29] <Goat_Baka> Tension Paper
[1:22:37] <@Solidus_113> it's one small detail that changes, it doesn't change the actual ending at all in Deltarune
[1:22:38] <Lieutenant_America> It's the best outcome, is it not?
[1:22:38] <%strugglepunk2> Toby makes a weird but fun game, basically.

[1:54:49] <%strugglepunk2> @WoolieVersus With two enemies, it's better to combo spare one enemy so the screen is less hectic
[1:54:49] <+Skelemungus> nope you get power by doing that
[1:54:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> grazing gives TP
[1:54:50] <Lieutenant_America> Nope. The outline means a NEAR hit, which gives you Meter
[1:54:50] <EASrake> Combat Edging
[1:54:51] <$TyroneRugen> grazing gives you tension points
[1:54:51] <Bionicghost> it's ikaruga, woolie

[1:54:53] <ShreddingPixels> EDGE
[1:54:53] <+furiousfurioso> grazing gives TP
[1:54:54] <$cureneckbeard> graze
[1:54:55] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus when you see the outline that means you gained TP for a near miss
[1:54:55] <MyNameIsRasus> EDGE
[1:54:58] <AlfredoChicken> InB4 first tries jevil
[1:55:02] <Sloavon> EDGE
[1:55:02] <CuttleCrow> grazing, it gives you TP and makes your turn come faster

[2:29:58] <CuttleCrow> I can't wait to see other possibilities in the full game

[2:34:14] <Prism_Wing> is the
[2:34:21] <Prism_Wing> is there?*
[2:34:21] <+yoshkosh20> pat is a strange goblin
[2:34:24] <+Order_of_Mystery> I cannot think of a single bad song he's ever made
[2:34:28] <nutimik> Mick Gordon is still MVP imo
[2:34:29] <VexicBayn> @order_of_mystery we found a Hot Tamales style cinnamon, blue raspberry, chocolate. and like cherry or some shit, they were fun experiments but cleanip took forever and they ultimately were garbage
[2:34:34] <Laironx3> @woolieversus Use manual during a battle and see what happens. Item>Manual.
[2:34:39] <A_DEAD_SHOW> There are 3 Forces in the world Good, Evil, and Pat
[2:34:43] <+skylerpilot> Steff's Ralsei sounds like a Minnesotan soccer mom
[2:35:24] <+skylerpilot> I guess that would be a Hockey mom...
[2:35:25] <monzy101> did he play titanfall 2 yet?

[2:35:26] <Lieutenant_America> I didn't even know you could do this!
[2:35:35] <MaxPainChaos> LUL
[2:35:40] <%king_wragles> So I looked around the chat to see where @WoolieVersus was reading that stuff, then I realized he reads donations as he streams...
[2:35:47] <GundamF91> toby fox made banger homestuck music for its whole lifetime so hes really good at this shit now
[2:35:54] <%GohanEgret> @monzy101 that was last week, tonight is deltarune and perhaps nier automata
[2:35:56] <+Skelemungus> nw toss the manual
[2:35:58] <nutimik> I hope she tries tossing away the manual
[2:36:10] <%UrsulaCat> undertale exists because of homestuck mpreg fan art
[2:36:13] <monzy101> but... ps4 :(
[2:36:13] <+Order_of_Mystery> yo @WoolieVersus : buttered popcorn, cinnamon, sugar. Bam. There's your cinnabon right there
[2:36:17] <+GrislyBoar> @sakuraa98 Don't forget the Earthbound ROM hacks.
[2:36:57] <EASrake> Yeah but Checking tho
[2:36:58] <%laserbeaming> TENSION
[2:37:17] <+JackMillerTime> thats a good idea
[2:37:19] <+Order_of_Mystery> smell and taste
[2:37:20] <EASrake> Taste i would imagine
[2:37:20] <%GohanEgret> what
[2:37:22] <FenixSeraph> Jelly Bellies?
[2:37:23] <Novillion> no eat it
[2:37:25] <numbus_26> "buttered popcorn? What is...?"
[2:37:30] <Shiranui24> that sounds good
[2:37:30] <+kelvinxj> eat it tho
[2:37:31] <+Order_of_Mystery> helps it stick together
[2:37:38] <%UrsulaCat> buttered popcorn is starch
[2:37:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Someone mentioned working at a movie theater before.
[2:37:40] <+Order_of_Mystery> and be sure to thank @vexicbayn
[2:37:40] <+JackMillerTime> naw but a bucket of it
[2:37:43] <%king_wragles> Cinnabon uses butter in their cinnamon stuff @WoolieVersus
[2:37:45] <gslayer14> im gonna make that
[2:37:45] <%Epic_Skeptic> I rather just have Cinnabon
[2:37:47] <%laserbeaming> 69 tension. Nice
[2:37:51] <gslayer14> thanks random chat member
[2:37:56] <+rdark_ksu> i will never understand the desire for cinnamon
[2:37:57] <xtremegamer80> Best boss battle coming up soon
[2:37:57] <+RowenCleric> cinnamon buns are made with butter
[2:38:02] <EASrake> Butter is a rather important part of everything that tastes good
[2:38:06] <VexicBayn> I've done a good thing today
[2:38:09] <%king_wragles> Ya, just having cinnabon would be easier
[2:38:13] <Agami23> @WoolieVersus there used to be a glitch with the PC version of the game that would triple the speed of the game.
[2:38:55] <+Toa697> it was if you set it to full screen it would unlock from 60 to the monitor refresh right?
[2:38:59] <%UrsulaCat> ralsei you're so hurt
[2:39:12] <CuttleCrow> yeah fullscreen was messed up
[2:39:20] <VexicBayn> RUB CINNAMON ON THE BOY

[2:40:43] <$TyroneRugen> heal items work, not spells

[2:41:05] <Agami23> you can use items outside of battle, but you can use spells for free IN battle

[2:45:38] <%king_wragles> I think your current mic is fine @WoolieVersus, but if you ever HAD to use the boom mics have you thought about putting them behind the couch and over the shoulder?
[2:45:39] <PinkLemonFlare> I see that you're streaming the Game of the year for 2018 lytOHYES
[2:45:40] <FenixSeraph> Ralsei is a good boi

[2:46:37] <+these_pockets> Woolie pointing out that there isn't much room there just fucked with me majorly because I was really wrong about the perspective and thought there was like 10 fucking feet
[2:46:42] <%UrsulaCat> it's an undertale reference

[2:55:34] <RoboXGP> "earthbound" is really good, nah just cute
[2:55:43] <%king_wragles> Is the DMC 5 LP starting as soon as it's released or are you and Pat gonna wait a bit @WoolieVersus ? (the delay with LPs being pre recorded excluded)
[2:55:44] <$BioStormX> Do you still get the activated charcoal? Do you buy a tub of powder, or those anti-gas caps, or what
[2:55:44] <$KnivesEve> @WoolieVersus i stuck with tokyo mirage session lp. ill stick to whatever
[2:55:45] <%laserbeaming> Mother 3 is fantastic. Will never, ever get localized
[2:55:46] <RoboXGP> mother 3 is dope
[2:55:52] <CuttleCrow> Mother 3 is v. v. good
[2:55:53] <Goat_Baka> Mother 3 is really strong
[2:55:55] <Lieutenant_America> Reggie died trying to localize it
[2:55:55] <nutimik> Earhtbound wasn't my thing, very slow game
[2:55:55] <%laserbeaming> no fucking way
[2:55:57] <+these_pockets> Are you playing on Switch, or have you ascended and realised Pro Controller is best PC pad
[2:55:58] <Calek> you set your expectations high for mother 3? but why
[2:55:58] <haitakaa> what about Father 4?
[2:56:04] <Spydurman> Woloie Will Figure it Out episde 5?

[2:56:24] <nutimik> unless she does the thing
[2:56:25] <Calek> 1/3
[2:56:26] <Lieutenant_America> halfway there
[2:56:28] <EASrake> what about 7 Grand Dad Kappa

[2:56:38] <josemoya95> about half
[2:56:39] <haitakaa> 4/7
[2:56:46] <MaxPainChaos> Lancer said half way
[2:56:48] <RoboXGP> blood dragon?
[2:56:49] <A_DEAD_SHOW> Adam Nelly/4
[2:56:52] <%laserbeaming> But consider that Undertale/Deltarune are kind of better than Earthbound/Mother 3. At least to me.
[2:56:59] <+Cavumentum> Hey! This isn't my Fortnitanfall stream!

[2:58:45] <$eco419> Paige is meta
[2:58:46] <%king_wragles> Can a mod strike that one comment for me? It's spoilery and I wasn't thinking

[2:59:43] <Ner234> Bangers SourPls
[2:59:44] <numbus_26> ohhhhh, when it's asleep it looks like a chess pawn, that's why it's called ponman
[2:59:45] <+Toa697> toby fox is a musical mastermind
[2:59:46] <%UrsulaCat> Bart is such a rude jojo
[2:59:46] <laazybulbasaur> Is this her first time playing through this?
[2:59:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> So here enjoys soundcloud mashup version of deltarune
[2:59:50] <%strugglepunk2> Toby Fox has always been the music guy first and foremost
[2:59:52] <deafmelone> Jort Jompson
[2:59:53] <nutimik> The music for a lot of the other chapters are already written too, Toby said
[2:59:57] <zeroraider> creative dog juices
[2:59:58] <+DeaconBluesClues> 'we are number one' just goes with everything fam
[3:00:02] <+Piemen99> woolieLORE
[3:00:04] <Kain5707> @WoolieVersus this was created before Undertale he might have already had the music done
[3:00:06] <+Toa697> burger truck
[3:00:08] <nutimik> Bergentrückung
[3:00:10] <%strugglepunk2> He's the type to actually do the music first and let that color the scene
[3:00:10] <Lieutenant_America> Megalovania is interesting in that it's been a constantly evolving track
[3:00:12] <A_DEAD_SHOW> BEkentruck
[3:00:13] <FenixSeraph> Burger Truck King
[3:00:16] <Lieutenant_America> Over a long period of time
[3:00:16] <gslayer14> borgar
[3:00:17] <%king_wragles> It translates to Mountain King @WoolieVersus

[3:00:30] <BeeNoons> earthbound hack and homestuck
[3:00:30] <RoboXGP> it's always day time at whoolies house
[3:00:33] <Goat_Baka> Bergentrückung and ASGORE is the main theme
[3:00:34] <JigsK> the halloween earthbound hack
[3:00:35] <Lieutenant_America> Halloween Hack, then Homestuck, then Undertale
[3:00:39] <+paladinstarbuster> burgertrucking
[3:00:45] <%king_wragles> @CatmanIX actually ya, I think that was it.
[3:00:45] <+Forente> He was work shopping it for a while
[3:00:45] <+ThatGuyfromMars> lancer's theme sounds like a really slowed down version of bonetrussel
[3:00:48] <+KingZaffy> Hot take: Megalovania is actually crazy overrated and Undertale/Deltarun have way better tracks in them
[3:00:51] <majindusto> Uhg...Homestuck
[3:00:52] <Lieutenant_America> The Homestuck version of Megalovania is my personal favorite
[3:00:59] <Tisaric> fingas in his asss
[3:01:02] <Papafleish> can you make your characters do a dab?

[3:31:32] <CuttleCrow> his Vegas playthough was painful
[3:31:32] <wydamn> One of my favorite moments was when Pat beat the game, and then had an anxiety-induced meltdown over what might have happened if he used up more magnum ammo before the final boss.

[3:44:39] <+DeaconBluesClues> >social eating
[3:44:40] <+skylerpilot> @zafooru nah the commercial is the origin of Top Kek. The WoW thing is pretty coincidental or maybe more transient in its relation to the meme. the fact that its so easy to meld the two for sure lends credence to the fact that the WoW thing probably helped it stick because a lot of people probably used / laughed at it because they thought it was related
[3:44:41] <Lieutenant_America> Veggies and Red Bull, the ultimate combo
[3:44:42] <laazybulbasaur> Oh shit

[3:45:35] <+paladinstarbuster> what does MUKBANG MEAN?
[3:45:44] <+mobius_won> Do the opposite of pat and Paige
[3:45:47] <RoboXGP> With all the talking they do and donations
[3:45:47] <$cureneckbeard> mukbang is orcish for eating
[3:45:50] <Graxe_> You can also change the category to Real Life.

[3:46:31] <%GohanEgret> @paladinstarbuster apparently it's a combination of "eating" and "broadcast" in korean
[3:46:40] <%laserbeaming> Such a cute NPC
[3:46:41] <Goraka91> Ralsei is a good boy/girl/monster thing
[3:46:46] <+paladinstarbuster> Thanks gohan
[3:46:58] <%GohanEgret> wikipedia saves the day

[3:47:12] <Goraka91> Okay good boy it is
[3:47:14] <%laserbeaming> @Goraka91 the game refers to him as Fluffy Boy, so it's safe to say he's a boy

[3:49:10] <RoboXGP> death is enivetable
[3:49:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We all can die
[3:49:13] <VexicBayn> experience minus
[3:49:13] <eggsm4china> @WoolieVersus Going negative on one character just means it's harder to revive them
[3:49:13] <CatmanIX> *90
[3:49:14] <+skylerpilot> you can die
[3:49:15] <%laserbeaming> You can die vs CHAOS CHAOS
[3:49:15] <DrStinkers> your health keeps going past 0
[3:49:16] <Lieutenant_America> Now we KNOW Woolie never fought Jevil
[3:49:16] <+velemi> you can
[3:49:16] <%CubicPhantom> i'm guessing Woolz never found the hard fight
[3:49:17] <Mr_Strut> You can die
[3:49:22] <eggsm4china> But if all of your characters go down, you die
[3:49:22] <+Aztec50> i think you have to party wipe
[3:49:22] <nutimik> If both are dead
[3:49:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only if all party members go into minus
[3:49:24] <CatmanIX> if both characters die, you ded
[3:49:24] <laazybulbasaur> Woolz was gone for 20 seconds and shit was on fire
[3:49:24] <BeeNoons> you can die it's just health to return to positive
[3:49:25] <JaseAdrift> you can
[3:49:25] <TooNaCly4U> you can
[3:49:25] <%king_wragles> You can die, it goes by DnD rules @WoolieVersus
[3:49:27] <fuji_92> you can die
[3:49:27] <The_Letter_B_Eight_Times> Breaking the bounds of failure
[3:49:28] <subjectg> well, if you do the thing...
[3:49:28] <JanusII> You have to all be zero or under.
[3:49:28] <+stagemage> whole party has to go down
[3:49:28] <KazMkII> If you are ALL dead
[3:49:31] <shiny_prinny> yes

[3:49:43] <%laserbeaming> Woolie woolieVS CHAOS when?
[3:49:56] <%king_wragles> Oh really? I thought single party members could
[3:49:59] <eggsm4china> SAVE THE DAMN CAKE
[3:49:59] <matouci> When one person dies they go into negative health and gain hp back over time until they get back to positive
[3:50:05] <RoboXGP> SVC Chaos?
[3:50:08] <subjectg> only party wipes game over
[3:50:08] <+velemi> Getting negative health = dead, and you have to heal back to positive to revive

[4:22:28] <$BioStormX> Sibling fights don't count, they are necessary
[4:22:30] <%Zubaz> Woolie fought Shock Master once
[4:22:32] <evbites> Kill it with VIOLENCE
[4:22:33] <Lieutenant_America> I do appreciate that when you fight, Susie surrenders because she's afraid for Lancer's health.
[4:22:33] <%UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus punch me punch dad
[4:22:41] <th3madness> looks like free XP

[4:25:03] <eggsm4china> She can't handle the stress damage
[4:25:22] <HitchhikingThrough> @eggsnbakefest Susie couldn't handle it?
[4:25:34] <%QueequegTheater> I handled it fine. I handled it fine TWICE, and I'm a 400 pound ball of neuroses
[4:25:49] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Succ it nerd
[4:25:52] <eggsm4china> That's too much stress damage. Plus, she's only resolve level 3

[4:27:43] <%QueequegTheater> These RE2 mods are getting out of control
[4:28:04] <$TyroneRugen> I didn't like Lancer initially, but the Lancer-Susie friendship is great.
[4:28:05] <RottenK> uhhh
[4:28:07] <HitchhikingThrough> Is it just me, or does Suzie's voice sounds like Wakka?
[4:28:10] <RottenK> that doesnt sound good
[4:28:11] <+MagicBeanBurrito> oh that sounds sketchy as fuck
[4:28:13] <VexicBayn> lEWD

[4:29:10] <HitchhikingThrough> "Maybe we should go to the Dark World, take our Blitz Balls..."
[4:29:11] <Lieutenant_America> Odds are the full game will address the implications of the Darkners being subservient
[4:29:13] <fuji_92> "At least Lightners aren't Al bheds, right brudah?"
[4:29:13] <+cvp5127> tsun
[4:29:15] <Fear_Ranjer> I have no doubt the Darkener's subservient role will be heavily touched upon

[4:33:19] <eggsm4china> "Eh, you poor Al Bheds, you deserve worse dan dis, yah?"
[4:33:35] <evbites> good
[4:33:35] <Lieutenant_America> Aw
[4:33:35] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:33:36] <KoyFoster> Nice
[4:33:36] <%king_wragles> the last DMC 5 trailer is a huge spoiler btw
[4:33:37] <HitchhikingThrough> "Hey Bruddah, I don't know about these Darkners. I'm just saying, maybe we need to something 'bout them."
[4:33:39] <%laserbeaming> yeah, avoid it
[4:33:48] <%XzileGaming> he said whenever you wanted to, Woolie
[4:33:49] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> Don't let spoil it like they did with Pat
[4:33:56] <+Skelemungus> dont watch that trailer unless you want big spoiler
[4:34:00] <LVDoomien> IIRC Woolie avoids all trailers anyway lol
[4:34:02] <fuji_92> "Hey, at least no Al bheds, eh brudah?"
[4:34:07] <%laserbeaming> Iron Shackle sounds like a pokemon move
[4:34:07] <evbites> It's weird how they added tofu into dmc
[4:34:08] <Lieutenant_America> Pat was upset with the final trailer?
[4:34:09] <%king_wragles> @Plague_Nurse oh no, Pat saw the trailer and was spoiled before that stream
[4:34:15] <$KnivesEve> i dont think its very spoliery but i get what you mean
[4:34:17] <%QueequegTheater> @king_wragles Not technically. Without spoiling, that one section is ambiguously directed and the last part was already in the first trailer.
[4:34:18] <+cvp5127> not really a spoiler
[4:34:19] <%king_wragles> then some dude spoiled it for other people in the chat
[4:34:31] <%laserbeaming> Eat the moss PogChamp
[4:34:38] <%king_wragles> @QueequegTheater Fair, but it confirmed a thing that was a mystery
[4:34:45] <+temporal_zenith> @king_wragles Yeah, it always sucks when that happens
[4:34:47] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> @king_wragles I meant that chat spoiled it for people who didn't watch it during Pat's stream
[4:34:48] <%king_wragles> oh wait, I can't read
[4:34:50] <%CubicPhantom> avoid spoilers by boycotting content... a bold strategy
[4:34:58] <%king_wragles> It happened in the first one too? That's fucked
[4:35:03] <vierleger> Avoid spoilers by never learning to read
[4:35:08] <%laserbeaming> You can't be spoiled if you never watch the movie
[4:35:15] <%laserbeaming> wait
[4:35:19] <Lieutenant_America> That's a statement begging to be contested
[4:35:21] <evbites> youtube is gonna become a minefield
[4:35:27] <+JustToWatch> avoid spoilers by never experiencing anything, ever
[4:35:27] <%laserbeaming> LUL

[4:52:43] <majindusto> Susie IS basically Paige
[4:53:03] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[4:54:01] <agadejobi> This is Deltarune, right? I thought it was just a demo?
[4:54:08] <CuttleCrow> its just a "demo"
[4:54:09] <HitchhikingThrough> @agadejobi its a BIG demo
[4:54:13] <doomerskeletor13> It is a demo
[4:54:14] <%GohanEgret> it's chapter 1
[4:54:17] <doomerskeletor13> Kinda
[4:54:19] <$TyroneRugen> deltarune is "chapter 1"
[4:54:25] <HitchhikingThrough> of 20
[4:54:28] <Lieutenant_America> It's all just setup
[4:54:31] <majindusto> CHAPTER 1
[4:54:34] <%king_wragles> Do we know when the next chapter is coming?
[4:54:35] <+ThatGuyfromMars> hopefully if toby doesn't change up chapter 1 I hope progress carries over
[4:54:40] <tech_nus> did toby recruit anyone for his team?
[4:54:40] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:54:40] <+CourageTheCat> I love how ralsei is canadian
[4:54:41] <$TyroneRugen> so it shouldn't be skipped, but theirs more coming.
[4:54:43] <+cvp5127> nude alert is chapter 2
[4:54:44] <doomerskeletor13> Toby said Chapter 1 might change
[4:54:45] <+CourageTheCat> like super canadian
[4:54:47] <HitchhikingThrough> No but for real it's chapter 1 of 7
[4:54:52] <Mr_Strut> tsun tsun
[4:55:00] <+JustToWatch> a full game is just a really extensive demo
[4:55:02] <vierleger> Ralsei sounds like a midwestern mom.
[4:55:05] <JayPastaForce> tsun tsunzie
[4:55:08] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @tech_nus he hasn't mentioned but since the reveal for the ps4 and switch demos mentioned a full game was coming it's possible
[4:55:11] <doomerskeletor13> I love the Ralsei voice
[4:55:13] <+CourageTheCat> tsuzie
[4:55:14] <%GohanEgret> @king_wragles at the time this came out, toby confirmed there wasn't a team nor real development started, could be years
[4:55:15] <doomerskeletor13> LUL
[4:55:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Why does Ralfi make me think of the Who's from Dr. Seuss?
[4:55:25] <$cureneckbeard> Did Woolie ever get his food
[4:55:30] <vierleger> We'll be right there to help you, don'cha know
[4:55:34] <SchroedingersFerret> Ralsei is part of Red Letter Media
[4:55:35] <HitchhikingThrough> Relatable
[4:55:44] <doomerskeletor13> REM LEZAR
[4:55:57] <Mr_Taters > @Youwereeatenbyalid Has that been mentioned? I could definitely see each chapter being a day of the week though
[4:55:59] <Klefth> No it isn't. Get back in that elevator
[4:56:10] <LVDoomien> is Kris actually Rem Lezar????
[4:56:10] <+linSP> wait CHARACTER development??
[4:56:25] <doomerskeletor13> Chara is Rem Lezar
[4:56:26] <%king_wragles> @GohanEgret I know it's pretty much a one man effort, just didn't know if there was a soft guess. It could take years though since undertale is longer than deltarune... and there's 3 years between those
[4:56:27] <HitchhikingThrough> @Mr_Taters\s no it's wild speculation. It seems reasonable, given Asriel comes back from college in a week
[4:56:28] <%QueequegTheater> cheer1500 Woolie and Steph, do you guys have any piece of media you absolutely love despite negative public perception? For example, my favorite Souls game is DS2 because Lucatiel's arc actually helped me get over a family member's death. It doesn't have to be a reason quite so heavy as that, but do you guys have any sort of "dark horses" of media that you feel more protective of your enjoyment of?
[4:56:38] <%QueequegTheater> Frist place boiz
[4:56:44] <eggsm4china> @WoolieVersus Get the fuck back in that elevator
[4:56:53] <SleepyMaribo> back into the elevator
[4:56:55] <HitchhikingThrough> GET THE FUCK BACK IN THERE
[4:56:57] <%laserbeaming> Why are people in the guys channels bringing up Rem Lezar? Isn't that an old movie?

[4:57:07] <Klefth> Yes.

[4:57:16] <%king_wragles> @GohanEgret by could I guess I mean it's really likely

[5:02:36] <numbus_26> I think that's probably a good call.
[5:02:36] <%laserbeaming> The bossfight is a proper super boss
[5:02:39] <%GohanEgret> chaos ... controlled Kappa
[5:02:40] <eggsm4china> @WoolieVersus I'll say that if you have trouble with fights in this game, the secret boss is gonna take a WHILE
[5:02:41] <$TyroneRugen> If your gonna stop now is good
[5:02:42] <silverira> its fast woolie but VERY hard
[5:02:46] <fuji_92> good call wools
[5:02:47] <HitchhikingThrough> @woolieversus WELCOME TO HELL LOVERBOY
[5:02:47] <Lieutenant_America> Boo, but you make a logical point
[5:02:49] <subjectg> yes, the parts after this are pretty lengthy
[5:02:50] <CuttleCrow> still haven't eaten LUL
[5:02:51] <%QueequegTheater> HAND ME THAT SANDWICH
[5:02:52] <cavefishes> did wollz get the food?
[5:02:53] <$TyroneRugen> G'night
[5:02:55] <Chaoko99> wait
[5:03:00] <Chaoko99> Is it still day for them?
[5:03:02] <VexicBayn> unbanned from ham sandwich
[5:03:06] <$Ralfclogs> anders6YADUN
[5:03:10] <+FloorBurger> BIG hunger
[5:03:17] <%UrsulaCat> jevil is sans???
[5:03:20] <+linSP> optional bosses man
[5:03:21] <LVDoomien> *ominous carnival music*
[5:03:22] <Lieutenant_America> More fair than Sans, but still tough as hell
[5:03:26] <%GohanEgret> jevil is ness undertale
[5:03:27] <VexicBayn> no
[5:03:28] <SleepyMaribo> Sans? lol oh no... Sans got nothign on this boss lol
[5:03:28] <nutimik> a certain compact streamer beat him first try on stream
[5:03:32] <Damie904> She should at least do a first run
[5:03:33] <Klefth> Stop
[5:03:34] <%QueequegTheater> Jevil vs. Valkyrie Queen
[5:03:35] <HitchhikingThrough> @woolieversus bopping soundtrack though
[5:03:35] <Zix_Serro> I can't wait for people to come to the second part first and think she's gonna start fighting Jevil.
[5:03:36] <Cluetevrelix> sans undertale
[5:03:37] <VexicBayn> and don't say anything else
[5:03:40] <nutimik> lol Sans is waaay harder than this boss dude
[5:03:40] <+skylerpilot> its way easier than sans
[5:03:41] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus Steph first try no problem
[5:03:41] <Spydurman> beating this boss may not be possible, Jevil is legit unbeatable to a degree
[5:03:45] <JustTossedMyCoin999> @nutimik did he also beat dark souls 3?
[5:03:47] <tattleworm> it's way more fair than sans
[5:03:55] <subjectg> @nutimik i’m still very surprised by it
[5:04:02] <tech_nus> Such lies
[5:04:02] <nutimik> yea but he died to pinwheel, he GOT FUCKED @dsauce999
[5:04:04] <Spydurman> huh guess I might be wrong
[5:04:04] <doomerskeletor13> The fight is easier than sans for sure
[5:04:05] <PainfulBuggery> LAUGH AT WOOLIE
[5:04:05] <%laserbeaming> It's fucking hard
[5:04:06] <+MisterRockett> Just do one run of him pleeease.
[5:04:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yeah Woolie, let the pro do it
[5:04:07] <CuttleCrow> the pants haven't been lower
[5:04:09] <+Skelemungus> easier than sans but still challenging
[5:04:09] <eggsm4china> @WoolieVersus He's got less gimmicks than sans, but he's VERY hard regardless
[5:04:11] <ElenaManetta> Sans is easier because it becomes a memory game after awhile. Jevil is mostly randomized.
[5:04:13] <fuji_92> Have faith sure...
[5:04:19] <FenixSeraph> FYI Woolie DMCV spoilers are out, just be careful
[5:04:21] <$cureneckbeard> Have lucky faith
[5:04:25] <%king_wragles> back
[5:04:28] <%king_wragles> DID THEY EAT YET
[5:04:33] <CuttleCrow> Woolie just wants to practice off screen LUL LUL LUL
[5:04:33] <$cureneckbeard> no
[5:04:34] <VexicBayn> nope
[5:04:35] <nutimik> but Jevil is not that hard to do on reaction
[5:04:39] <$cureneckbeard> food cold now
[5:04:40] <%laserbeaming> The Ribs grow cold
[5:04:45] <LVDoomien> *Ominous Carnival Music*
[5:04:45] <nutimik> takes maybe a few tries, not hours like Sans
[5:04:47] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[5:04:48] <Mr_Strut> COWARD
[5:04:49] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> aww
[5:04:51] <HitchhikingThrough> @king_wragles I got them to find Jevil, they're now taking a break

[5:06:54] <shooziii> What about Daemon X Machina?
[5:06:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Never play Nier

[5:07:15] <$cureneckbeard> Having too many video games to play is such a first world problem
[5:07:17] <ElenaManetta> Well this is usually why people choose a channel to run or streaming, I don't think many people try to keep up both with the same amount of content
[5:07:18] <damienlunas> Woolie it sounds like you need more ENERGY to do the things you want to do.
[5:07:21] <fuji_92> Nier, gotta get the nier. Nier, gotta get the nier.
