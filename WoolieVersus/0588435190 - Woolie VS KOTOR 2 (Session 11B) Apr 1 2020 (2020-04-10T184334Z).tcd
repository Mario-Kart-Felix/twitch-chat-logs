[0:31:46] <DatAsuna> You've talked about this multiple times before woolie
[0:31:47] <e3a4> Its only fucked up if you dont wipe them
[0:31:56] <%Gruhunchously> They need to Become Human
[0:31:57] <DatAsuna> You've had this realization ON AIR several times
[0:32:06] <KaiserMario> For more on that, play Mass Effect
[0:32:14] <alrobot2014> everyone agrees droids are the worst, just like the vorcha
[0:32:17] <alrobot2014> fuck the vorcha
[0:32:41] <+PlagueOfGripes> in the Revenge of the Sith novel, there's pages devoted to Anakin tricking Obi-Won into calling R2 "him" instead of "it"
[0:32:43] <+democrazyyy> clone wars so good
[0:32:45] <+kapcommunist> R2 may have some hacked holograms...
[0:32:51] <Redblood801> Down side, droids can turn into massive killers if they're not wiped
[0:32:59] <+democrazyyy> r2 has the porn stash
[0:32:59] <KaiserMario> You abort their mind's birth
[0:33:06] <Chuckgofer> The droids should just ask niocely for their rights
[0:33:08] <DatAsuna> yeah there's a bunch of droid rebellion subplots
[0:33:15] <DatAsuna> not main droid rebellion main plots
[0:33:27] <DatAsuna> it's almost always just a side thing that happens and gets crushed lol
[0:34:10] <%Gruhunchously> If the droids couldn't win their independence, they didn't deserve it.
[0:34:20] <Chuckgofer> FLESHIES FIRST
[0:34:26] <Redblood801> If you don't wipe droids, you get 4-LOM, who murdered an entire Yacht of civilians
[0:34:41] <Chuckgofer> I'm not hearing a negative here
[0:35:33] <%Gruhunchously> We're doing this now
[0:35:33] <%siamzero94> How unfortunate for you guys
[0:35:34] <oldmemesdiehard> Deeeee
[0:35:35] <+kapcommunist> some lvl 5 HK trashmobs
[0:35:43] <grandark_z317> I love all the HK's dialogue
[0:35:49] <jorniev> t3 can take 3 hk droids think about this shit
[0:35:55] <+ChrisAlgoo> what was that song woolie was singing?
[0:35:56] <oldmemesdiehard> 1v3, get them in the corner
[0:35:58] <+Proxzo> Unlimited POWEERRR
[0:36:00] <Chuckgofer> Even the Fake-Ks
[0:36:25] <oldmemesdiehard> Shooting stars is what they were humming
[0:36:26] <+kapcommunist> big goy in the back dont want that smoke
[0:36:31] <oldmemesdiehard> Methinks
[0:36:38] <%Gruhunchously> We have the OG
[0:36:52] <Redblood801> Another Chasis
[0:37:03] <NeakGX> god imagine being made specifically for battle and getting beasted by a pedestrian lookin boi
[0:37:24] <%Gruhunchously> Darth T3's power cannot be matched.
[0:37:48] <%Gruhunchously> *Middle finger*
[0:38:12] <DatAsuna> not just the androids
[0:38:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:38:15] <%jiggy_snipe> T3 is sassy
[0:38:16] <ZeeJiggle> T3 is just like, "Complete Annihilation."
[0:38:25] <+kapcommunist> space yachts are classy
[0:38:26] <AllTheZibas> Not just the droids, but the droid women, and children too
[0:38:55] <Chuckgofer> Right... Not Korriban
[0:39:01] <grandark_z317> "you need me." No, we don't. God, fuck this bitch.
[0:39:10] <+ChrisAlgoo> fuck around and find out (but pay me my credits)
[0:39:18] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:39:26] <AllTheZibas> SNITCHES GET STITCHES
[0:39:28] <ZeeJiggle> why
[0:39:34] <Redblood801> Gands are dope
[0:39:48] <DatAsuna> yee gand are cool
[0:39:52] <grandark_z317> GANTZ
[0:39:54] <NeakGX> their noises sound like record scratches
[0:40:14] <+kapcommunist> t3 lvl up!
[0:40:45] <dorpork> get dex
[0:40:53] <%lotharrio> Scales with his level.
[0:41:54] <grandark_z317> Mira literally has no reason to be here.
[0:42:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @grandark_z317 just like jar jar
[0:42:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> in phantom menace he has no reason to stick around
[0:42:37] <grandark_z317> Jar Jar's at least fun to watch bumble about.
[0:42:40] <atema128> Getting close to the end of the Nar Shaadda arc.
[0:43:06] <grandark_z317> Mira is so smug and arrogant when her first scenes are her getting her ass handed to her.
[0:43:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> thats a strong statmeent gran but ok
[0:43:24] <dorpork> "has no reason to be here" could describe most rpg characters. in kotor 1 only bastila and carth were relevant to the story
[0:43:27] <+kapcommunist> been loving this LP with master V's guidance
[0:43:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> Well in kotor 2 a lot have been blackmailed by kreia. Not Mira tho
[0:44:51] <atema128> @grandark_z317 She successfully makes Hanharr chicken out of killing her despite his badass talk, poisons a Jedi and breaks herself out of captivity. Yeah, what an ass kicking. *eyeroll*
[0:45:35] <oldmemesdiehard> Everyone is here because otherwise Kreia will cancel them on twitter dot com
[0:45:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:45:42] <+kapcommunist> mmmm... hanhar chicken
[0:45:54] <%Gruhunchously> Handmaiden is here because Atris ordered her
[0:46:01] <delilah4you> Did I miss the GAMERCUBE?
[0:46:51] <grandark_z317> @atema128 she wouldn't have had to break herself out if she let Fann do what he was doing to do anyway.
[0:46:53] <%Gruhunchously> All of the room have closed their doors. Smart really.
[0:46:57] <Chuckgofer> GOOD DROPS!
[0:47:11] <Redblood801> BIG DEX
[0:47:12] <Memdosu> @Kenori yeah and its very quick death
[0:47:15] <atema128> @kenori Yeah Woolie showed it off a bit earlier.
[0:47:22] <NeakGX> belt o numbers
[0:48:03] <Redblood801> Lootra? Who's that?
[0:48:07] <%Gruhunchously> @grandark_z317 But if she hadn't, Fann would have been shocked into submission and killed while he was unconscious.
[0:48:10] <Redblood801> I don't know a Lootra?
[0:48:25] <Chuckgofer> Jedi Killer/thief
[0:48:27] <+democrazyyy> I think he was just using his shield instead of the doors
[0:49:01] <Redblood801> Guys?
[0:49:03] <%Gruhunchously> We'll send Jimmy. C'mon, it's just ONE Utility Droid, how bad can it be?
[0:49:23] <%chiazam> MCDELIVERY
[0:50:05] <KishinGrek> R2 noises
[0:50:16] <%Gruhunchously> I like how Mira and Atton are just watching as T3 zaps away
[0:50:19] <%lotharrio> Technically Visas can be avoided. Mira and Handmaiden are also optional in the sense that they aren't always recruited every run.
[0:50:35] <KishinGrek> Zzzzzzap
[0:50:39] <NeakGX> wasn't there an option to kill the Sith girl?
[0:50:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> if you stay grey and never get Visas wha happens
[0:50:43] <%jiggy_snipe> they need to stand aside and let T3 work
[0:50:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> is she on the ravager
[0:50:51] <DatAsuna> can barely hear them over the zipzaps xD
[0:51:07] <atema128> Gotta say, one thing KotOR 2 doesn’t have going for it is how much of a slog events like this can be.
[0:51:15] <+MidnightBurst12> strats
[0:51:22] <%Gruhunchously> You always get Visas. If you don't meet the alignment requirement, you trigger her automatically after your second planet.
[0:51:36] <%Gruhunchously> @atema128 And THIS is the Restored Content.
[0:51:39] <xenolaliaSA> does he have lightsaber finesse yet
[0:51:44] <dorpork> lightsaber finesse
[0:52:03] <%Gruhunchously> But KOTOR 1 had the same problem tbf
[0:52:51] <%Gruhunchously> Don't worry, he gets up agian
[0:52:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:53:15] <Chuckgofer> Tokiotome
[0:53:28] <atema128> Right, everything combat-wise eventually just becomes about spamming Force Storm to avoid spending minutes mopping up dozens of enemies one by one.
[0:53:43] <%Gruhunchously> The one saving grace of this sequence is that it's relatively short.
[0:53:48] <%Gruhunchously> *relatively
[0:53:59] <Chuckgofer> Not if woolie can help it
[0:56:56] <+deathman00789> PokMaskedpika
[0:57:32] <RiverBirch> There's more where that came from!
[0:58:06] <%Gruhunchously> Spoke too soon
[0:58:16] <DatAsuna> every room
[0:58:20] <SixthSun2> I for one prefer talk-combat
[0:58:20] <DatAsuna> you're gonna do every room
[0:58:22] <Chuckgofer> CRAZY TALKS RANGE IS UNLIMITED
[0:58:27] <atema128> Nope, there’s significantly more.
[0:58:29] <TheVoltStrike> this encounter is very big
[0:58:37] <KaitlynnHere> woolies right, atton is lying
[0:58:58] <Chuckgofer> What? Nah, attons a good boi, hes big blue
[0:59:07] <KaitlynnHere> oh yeah
[0:59:10] <KaitlynnHere> so much blue
[0:59:19] <KaitlynnHere> just pazzak
[0:59:22] <KaitlynnHere> and boobs
[0:59:32] <%Gruhunchously> Appropriate, considering he just slaughtered a small army
[0:59:44] <+MidnightBurst12> The only things you need to be honest
[0:59:59] <%siamzero94> He's a false wookie, so yeah, it's wasted on him
[1:00:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:00:11] <Chuckgofer> !MOTIVATED
[1:00:11] <@Moobot> 773 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:00:18] <KaitlynnHere> where?
[1:00:21] <KaitlynnHere> hhm
[1:00:27] <KaitlynnHere> but it's coming!
[1:00:27] <MayorRev> thonk
[1:00:36] <%Gruhunchously> God, if you're crit stacking you hear that line pretty much every round
[1:01:10] <Visorak6> I love that refugee just standing there and watching you ice those guys
[1:01:20] <Chuckgofer> T3 learning jkreais lessons better than Fann
[1:01:29] <KaitlynnHere> they've gotten used to it by now
[1:01:29] <%Gruhunchously> It's Nar Shadaa, it's probably just another day for him.
[1:01:35] <KaitlynnHere> right
[1:01:37] <SixthSun2> Jebaited yourself
[1:01:41] <KaitlynnHere> there's gangs everywhere
[1:01:46] <Redblood801> It's the first episode all over again
[1:01:54] <%Gruhunchously> IT Droid
[1:02:25] <Chuckgofer> "Yeah, you know." TL;DR Yeah its always fucked like that
[1:02:47] <KaitlynnHere> he's weirdly shiny
[1:02:52] <dorpork> the extremely closed in camera shots only happen if you move extremely close to an npc. there\s no reason to do that,ytou can initiate dialogue from far away
[1:02:55] <KaitlynnHere> like in a melted plastic kind of way
[1:03:11] <%Chatterbox1991> BAO DUR
[1:03:12] <MayorRev> Is this a mixture of spanish and hindu?
[1:03:13] <%Gruhunchously> He's shinier than T3
[1:03:16] <%Chatterbox1991> YOU WANT BAO DUR
[1:03:26] <Redblood801> T3
[1:03:27] <%Chatterbox1991> YOU NEED HIS SHIELD BREAKER
[1:03:28] <Chuckgofer> ATTONS A DROID
[1:03:31] <%Gruhunchously> A force user, perhaps
[1:03:32] <Graxe_> I've missed HK
[1:03:32] <dorpork> atton and t3
[1:03:44] <%Gruhunchously> T3 and HK? HELL YEAH
[1:03:45] <supuhmagikarp> Oh n,
[1:03:45] <%NWannabe> don't they hate each other?
[1:03:55] <Redblood801> No lifeforms detected!
[1:04:00] <KaitlynnHere> yeah t3 tried to kill hk
[1:04:01] <supuhmagikarp> Well now they have a t3 vs three HK-50 fight
[1:04:04] <shincadad> Holler
[1:04:11] <%Gruhunchously> Hey now
[1:04:14] <atema128> You want either Bao-Dur or somebody with a lightsaber.
[1:04:20] <Chuckgofer> HEY FUCK YOU Ebon hawk is beautiful
[1:04:22] <KaitlynnHere> fuck it
[1:04:49] <%Gruhunchously> That's actually really cool
[1:04:54] <Chuckgofer> Calling the ebon hawk ugly when your ship looks like the PS3 boomerang
[1:04:54] <Apolonm> nice ship
[1:04:59] <Redblood801> Good joke guys
[1:05:08] <%Gruhunchously> *Must resist urge to kill*
[1:05:20] <Akett> Darren Norris!
[1:05:21] <DatAsuna> reference
[1:05:27] <KaitlynnHere> and i was expecting someone... less of an asshole
[1:05:27] <grandark_z317> Emerl and Omega ready to go.
[1:05:31] <+ShadowArcangel> Youtube?
[1:05:36] <%Gruhunchously> The Youtube System?
[1:05:40] <+MidnightBurst12> ehh
[1:05:44] <KaitlynnHere> are u jeedi?!?!
[1:06:08] <grandark_z317> The Y'Toub Algorithm.
[1:06:18] <BearSawed> are you a jedi? swings saber nah brah. just built this
[1:06:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> kaaaachi
[1:06:28] <%Gruhunchously> Ehhhhh
[1:06:41] <%prime_name> Then the occasional YEYEYEYEYE part 1
[1:07:19] <%Irridium> GOTO a manlet
[1:07:19] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:07:58] <+vaporousTippler> You disrupted their flow of argent energy.
[1:08:04] <+MidnightBurst12> Telos seemed pretty fucked
[1:08:09] <%Djinnazz> lol
[1:08:22] <dereks0n> WWE's on that shit already
[1:08:31] <%Gruhunchously> They're dealing with the sandstorm
[1:08:32] <Redblood801> I only poo poo farted for the good of humanity
[1:08:38] <atema128> You caused an energy crisis with one explosion, Woolz.
[1:08:49] <Chuckgofer> Welp, guess we gotta become the mandos and steal resources
[1:08:53] <%Gruhunchously> Whoops
[1:08:54] <custoadian> "his"?
[1:08:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> HIS
[1:08:58] <%siamzero94> HIS CAMPAIGN
[1:08:58] <%prime_name> hhmmm
[1:08:59] <TheVoltStrike> his?
[1:09:00] <%yendoria> Dont worry about that
[1:09:05] <%Irridium> one of those "yeah we're still here and they're not but..."
[1:09:09] <DatAsuna> your choices matter
[1:09:22] <%Gruhunchously> I mean, of course they did. We saw it at the end of KOTOR 1
[1:09:23] <%Djinnazz> she did.
[1:09:28] <%Irridium> he did. And the republic still was super fucked
[1:10:00] <%Gruhunchously> @DatAsuna To be fair, this predates the 'your choices matter' era of RPGs. As in, the marketing.
[1:10:01] <DatAsuna> Also he just means you lost financially
[1:10:17] <DatAsuna> it's a pyrrhic victory
[1:10:19] <+ShadowArcangel> He means lost as in the economy
[1:10:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> Mass Effect was the first big yOU HAVE BIG MEANINGFUL CHANGES
[1:10:34] <xenolaliaSA> there's no more actual materiel
[1:10:43] <atema128> They won in the short term, lost in the long term.
[1:10:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> and even then its like ehhhh but you CAN replace the entire galactic govt with a human junta
[1:10:46] <DatAsuna> Nah liquid
[1:10:52] <DatAsuna> you forget the trailer for kotor 2
[1:10:56] <+amgoodball> E V I L L A K K
[1:11:03] <+amgoodball> Hi what I miss
[1:11:06] <DatAsuna> big dramatic DUM DUM DUM CHOICES LIGHT SIDE DARK SIDE
[1:11:07] <Halospaz117> But an EFFECTIVE oppressive empire!
[1:11:08] <%Gruhunchously> Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[1:11:08] <mihokspawn> @Gruhunchously this is one of the games that 'your choices matter' marketing is built on
[1:11:13] <DatAsuna> ONE CHOICE WILL SAVE THE GALAXY
[1:11:19] <DatAsuna> All that stuff
[1:11:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh
[1:11:50] <grandark_z317> Darth Mephiles
[1:12:01] <DatAsuna> "One will make the choice, all will make the journey"
[1:12:03] <%VCRUZZO> it is a bit frustrating
[1:12:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> Goto dresses kind of shabby for a mob boss
[1:12:13] <jorniev> ah yes that one guy who eats planets
[1:12:13] <DatAsuna> kotor 2 marketing was nonstop tooting the horn about choices
[1:12:32] <%Gruhunchously> @DatAsuna Again, to be fair, such choices do exist in this game, rare as they may be.
[1:12:33] <jorniev> goto doesnt wear anything
[1:12:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> (shhh)
[1:12:49] <DatAsuna> Never said they didn't
[1:12:53] <grandark_z317> the Black Beast...
[1:12:53] <dereks0n> Eldritch horrors will do that shit
[1:12:54] <DatAsuna> There's always the big couple
[1:12:56] <jorniev> nihilus is like pacman
[1:12:56] <atema128> The hungriest of bois
[1:13:00] <mihokspawn> #ashesOfKatar
[1:13:01] <ZeeJiggle> I like Goto's 90 degree angle on his forehead
[1:13:08] <+MidnightBurst12> Cthulhu speak is just stomach growls
[1:13:11] <DatAsuna> But the marketing is cringe regardless
[1:13:14] <+democrazyyy> nihilus is totally kirby
[1:13:21] <ZeeJiggle> actually more than 90
[1:13:32] <+ShadowArcangel> Let the Fire die and the age of Dark begin!
[1:13:40] <SixthSun2> People gettin wiped out
[1:13:44] <$StaceMcGate> Carth was in the Republic... fuck the Republic
[1:13:45] <+gutlesscoward> no wipeouts in this
[1:13:57] <DatAsuna> "I'm a millenial, so i don't like labels"
[1:14:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey Your that Witcher right?! the One with the Code?
[1:14:19] <+vaporousTippler> #notallforceusers
[1:14:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:24] <%Gruhunchously> Labels are thing you put on cans, man.
[1:14:38] <%rubbishbinge> Whip out the legally distinct beam katana
[1:14:43] <DatAsuna> it takes two to mind trick
[1:14:49] <NeakGX> "Jedi don't do light side later.. soooooo"
[1:14:56] <jorniev> but can you mind freak?
[1:15:11] <+ShadowArcangel> "Stop killing the galaxy you force wielding assholes!"
[1:15:12] <Graxe_> The Jedi religious branches of Jedi and Sith
[1:15:17] <%lotharrio> He's doing it for the Greater Goods and Services.
[1:15:17] <DatAsuna> not subtle
[1:15:20] <DatAsuna> but appreciated
[1:15:25] <Redblood801> JUST! STOP!
[1:15:27] <jorniev> qui gon jin gambled with slves... just saying
[1:15:30] <mihokspawn> Goto would not like 2020
[1:15:30] <%siamzero94> ??? you think you can make trade deals with hungry boi?
[1:15:47] <%NWannabe> Space Trains gotta run, homeboy
[1:15:48] <DatAsuna> he doesn't know hungry boi personally
[1:15:48] <%lotharrio> Exar-kun was 40 years ago, then the Mandolorian Wars, then the Jedi Civil War, now this Sith assassin shadow war.
[1:16:04] <+MidnightBurst12> constant star wars are not good for dividends
[1:16:12] <%siamzero94> @DatAsuna he knows about the desturction of planets
[1:16:19] <DatAsuna> and before exar kun was freedon nadd
[1:16:42] <jorniev> man living in the star wars universe would be actually garbage
[1:17:02] <a_mad_dragon> BLIND CHESS
[1:17:10] <+ShadowArcangel> He...he could
[1:17:19] <DatAsuna> @siamzero94 he doesn't know it's nihilus doing it, he barely understands anything about sith or jedi
[1:17:20] <+democrazyyy> he totally could be even called out visquis
[1:17:21] <%Gruhunchously> But he could, that's how he brought us here.
[1:17:27] <DatAsuna> You'll be back
[1:17:39] <Graxe_> Look not at the Mandalorians in the rooms they occupy
[1:17:40] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheFabledAble
[1:17:41] <DatAsuna> mybe even 3
[1:17:41] <ZeeJiggle> Mandalorian's, well known for their patience
[1:17:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> the Force does not computer. he just knows its magic religion.
[1:17:45] <+MidnightBurst12> I just wanna shake their hands
[1:17:45] <abelincoln_catpuncher> OOOOOOOOHHH boi do we
[1:17:49] <%Gruhunchously> WE CANNOT BE FRIENDS
[1:17:50] <DatAsuna> almost as if video games do things in 3s
[1:17:52] <%siamzero94> @DatAsuna Yeah, that's why he's full of shit. What are you arguing against?
[1:17:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> And he knows Hungry Boy and Crusty Boy are out there doing something
[1:18:08] <jorniev> speaking of mandalorians... how long HAVE THE MANDOS been around.
[1:18:12] <NeakGX> the crew comes in to save you and yer just playin some Pazzak
[1:18:13] <Redblood801> STONKS!
[1:18:13] <DatAsuna> @siamzero94 nobody's arguing dude
[1:18:26] <%jiggy_snipe> yes economics is very predictable that's why economists are great at their jobs Kappa
[1:18:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> he's like "Lets do a crime business, but only evade enough taxes to optimize the Laffer Curve"
[1:18:51] <%Gruhunchously> Then, the moisture farmers.
[1:19:10] <%Gruhunchously> Galactic Economics
[1:19:17] <atema128> Don’t forget the Mid Rim between them.
[1:19:20] <Chuckgofer> The corpses under Taris get a credit
[1:20:06] <DatAsuna> some of them are hilariously bad tho

[1:22:13] <shincadad> Hehehehehehehheheheheh
[1:22:15] <%Gruhunchously> Hmm, usually, there would be three HK-50s here. Are they gone because we have HK-47 with us?
[1:22:29] <Chuckgofer> "I never thought I'd be fighting side by side with a HK droid."
[1:22:36] <jorniev> its programing
[1:22:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> why does he even have strength?
[1:22:45] <%NWannabe> assassin
[1:22:47] <keylancer13> The HKs show up later
[1:23:05] <jorniev> to pass the saves?
[1:23:05] <Redblood801> When I was young, this part of the game glitched on me and had my party members show up in Goto's room
[1:23:10] <atema128> @gruhunchously They show up later as I recall.
[1:23:11] <alrobot2014> don't forget hk also has that crit feat
[1:23:13] <%lotharrio> HK does big crit damage as a character-specific Feat.
[1:23:33] <%Gruhunchously> Hk's crit damage is insane at higher levels.
[1:24:19] <%Gruhunchously> "Optimal Accuracy Ratio Achieved!"
[1:24:40] <keylancer13> Prejudice, set to maximum!
[1:25:18] <grandark_z317> did I just see that he has +23 to hit.
[1:25:27] <%Gruhunchously> I like these numbers
[1:25:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> is this 3.5 dnd?
[1:25:52] <e3a4> Bowcasters are the Falchions of Star Wars
[1:25:58] <Chuckgofer> BIG NUMBER
[1:26:00] <keylancer13> Functionally yes, it's 3.5

[1:26:23] <%Gruhunchously> You dug your own grave
[1:26:25] <Divryne> SILENCE.
[1:26:28] <grandark_z317> the power of HK
[1:26:28] <@Menitta> say it again I wasn't listening
[1:26:28] <%NWannabe> v the hero we need
[1:26:33] <%siamzero94> but still unupgradable though
[1:26:44] <Redblood801> Commentary: The hairy walking carpets make excellent weapons
[1:26:47] <ZeeJiggle> Jesus, HK with the Abyss Armor
[1:26:51] <grandark_z317> Hold your fire!
[1:26:52] <Chuckgofer> That jokes as evergreen as the fartgas pits
[1:27:01] <grandark_z317> This man is black!
[1:27:16] <%Gruhunchously> I'm loving this droid gang
[1:27:43] <dorpork> ? restored content mod changes nothing about this sequence
[1:28:49] <giga_bit> Did they install that droid planet content, or did they leave it out because it's super shoddy?
[1:28:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[1:28:55] <%Gruhunchously> Oh wow, I never knew about that.
[1:28:57] <Graxe_> Droid vs Droid violence
[1:29:00] <Graxe_> Soon
[1:29:00] <%Irridium> they left droid planet out
[1:29:03] <+democrazyyy> Woolie is the best jedi
[1:29:04] <+kagamint> good
[1:29:06] <+Moy_Luna> But did he REALLY pick the right team?
[1:29:08] <+democrazyyy> smartest team builder
[1:29:14] <Graxe_> Violence now
[1:29:16] <dorpork> droid planet is not restored content, it's just a fanmade mod, and a terrible one at that
[1:29:22] <atema128> @giga_bit They didn’t, it’s just regular restored content.
[1:29:27] <%Gruhunchously> Atton has some extra dialogue at a certain point, bbut this is fine.
[1:29:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> i remember that i got a really high level ion rifle, a Verpine Droid Disintegrator, randomly and i gave T3-M4 that mod that gives him the ability to use a rifle and it FUCKS
[1:29:36] <subjectg> fun fact, getting that upgrade for hk-47 is literally impossible in vanilla

[1:30:00] <ShiningAxis> HK looking like he's taking T3 for a walk
[1:30:02] <Redblood801> ZAP
[1:30:38] <$StaceMcGate> Bad crits
[1:30:39] <Redblood801> Peragus was so long ago
[1:30:40] <Chuckgofer> HK is a twitter troll "Ratio achieved"
[1:31:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Chuckgofer i mean he's both an assasin an a protocol droid
[1:31:33] <%Gruhunchously> They look like those interrrogation droids
[1:31:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> its also the droid that was being used to examine Baby Yoda
[1:31:48] <DatAsuna> they're also very annoying in jedi outcast and academy
[1:31:53] <DatAsuna> cause shots bounce off them

[1:33:24] <Goodvibes99508> there is a canister in that room to the right
[1:34:22] <%Gruhunchously> It's pretty cool, a bit more advanced then the standard KOTOR fare.
[1:35:24] <+lutefiiisk> drop your shield
[1:35:37] <Chuckgofer> "Hey HK, you alright?" 'I'M BLACK YA'LL!'
[1:35:39] <%Gruhunchously> I never figured out what those numbers are supposed to mean.
[1:35:45] <%Gruhunchously> Is it the Count?

[1:36:29] <%Pillagius> @Chuckgofer HK gon give it to them
[1:36:49] <%lotharrio> I got a random drop for a Tremor Sword the first time around early on. Ruined my feel for a lot of melee.
[1:37:00] <%Gruhunchously> First we gonna ROCK, then we gonna ROLL
[1:37:33] <$StaceMcGate> psaBig
[1:38:05] <%Gruhunchously> It's like those mirrors that see around corners.
[1:38:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> i dont get sonic damage and ion damage.Like ion damage. do all organics have an inherent resistance to it
[1:38:46] <%Pillagius> @LiquidDinosaur Ion does more to droid types, sonic - bypasses energy shields
[1:39:05] <%Djinnazz> lol
[1:39:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Oh no!
[1:39:26] <giga_bit> *sound of distant turret slaughter
[1:39:27] <%Gruhunchously> This whole thing is just droid on droid violence.
[1:39:28] <Heyestus> @LiquidDinosaur ion just gets a bonus against droids and shields. they still hurt organics
[1:39:37] <subjectg> They are putting viper poison in their turrets!

[1:42:18] <Redblood801> What's this? A Sci-Fi RPG woefully underpopulated by bees? A large influx of BEES should do the trick!
[1:42:26] <subjectg> double bladed master flurry looks awesome
[1:42:32] <%Gruhunchously> Rapids shoot as muzzle flair around the blaster.
[1:42:55] <jorniev> THOSE droids look cool
[1:42:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The cool version.
[1:43:05] <Chuckgofer> I'd unironically love a game of Kotor: Droids
[1:43:05] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:43:10] <%NWannabe> so much betteer than r2 and c3po

[1:43:18] <%Irridium> what if R2-D2 and C3-PO had GUN
[1:43:21] <%Gruhunchously> What is R2 and C-3PO hated each other and hated everyone else even more?
[1:43:22] <jorniev> i love the murder version of the droids
[1:43:24] <Chuckgofer> 12 companions, all droids
[1:43:45] <%RioGascar> R2 does have a body count
[1:44:01] <Chuckgofer> I'll count droid on droid violence for R2
[1:44:20] <Redblood801> Poison
[1:44:24] <%Gruhunchously> Remember that part of Attack of the Clones where R2-D2 pushed C-3PO off a platform just to get him out of that way?

[1:48:09] <Goldenwolf98> Myra gets the Boba Fett stuff
[1:48:13] <%lotharrio> The saves for the darts are really high.

[1:48:34] <Chuckgofer> Is that like a mini lightsaber dart?

[2:15:13] <%NWannabe> I like Kreia's flavor in the meal of this game
[2:15:15] <giga_bit> just a really grainy texture
[2:15:18] <$StaceMcGate> This LP is radiating lvl 50 out of Midgar
[2:15:33] <%NWannabe> Big Minh Energy?
[2:15:38] <cerazor01> Yes
[2:15:40] <Heyestus> primitive like hitting someone with a melee weapon
[2:15:40] <%Gruhunchously> Isn't that what the big bubble is?
[2:15:41] <$StaceMcGate> Big Big Minh
[2:15:47] <Chuckgofer> I figure they're literally invisible unless you're looking for them, hence awareness
[2:15:48] <custoadian> placing explosive mines on a spaceship seems like it might be a bad idea anyway
[2:16:00] <TheVoltStrike> no bit the mines have anti radar materials don't worry
[2:16:10] <@SoushinSen> are they still in nar shaddar?
[2:16:10] <%Gruhunchously> Buh bye
[2:16:18] <cerazor01> yes
[2:16:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> More than 0?
[2:16:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus We still find WW2 mines on the daily. Mines are pretty hard to detect when done well
[2:16:25] <%Irridium> sure are. almost done with it though
[2:16:31] <%NWannabe> you're all out of defense tho...and wait...doesn't he want fanny to help?\
[2:16:37] <Dave_VD> damn been going all day
[2:16:42] <cerazor01> You don't PUT Mines on Warships
[2:16:49] <cerazor01> those are sea mines
[2:16:50] <giga_bit> The Corpse (Nothing) Family
[2:16:53] <%Irridium> ZAP
[2:17:04] <cerazor01> you put them in the sea
[2:17:14] <%Gruhunchously> John knows what you did
[2:17:20] <%NWannabe> shocking development

[2:17:35] <Redblood801> What killed the dinosaurs? THE ICE AGE!
[2:17:36] <mihokspawn> What a SHOCKING turn of events
[2:17:36] <cerazor01> To turn a phrase
[2:17:40] <%NWannabe> I like the riddler one more
[2:17:41] <%Gruhunchously> What an electrifying experience!
[2:17:42] <Dave_VD> THE ICE AGW
[2:17:43] <$StaceMcGate> What killed the dinosaurs?
[2:17:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> What killed the Dinosaurs! THE ICE AGE
[2:17:46] <Chuckgofer> Technically thats how Mr Freeze used to be.
[2:17:47] <giga_bit> An electrifying battle!
[2:17:48] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> me and my friends always just scream "The Ice Age!" referencing it when we do anything ice or dinosaur related playing Monster Hunter
[2:17:55] <DSD24> Kick some Ice!
[2:17:57] <%eanscrale> cool down with all the puns
[2:17:58] <@SoushinSen> that move is lit
[2:18:05] <giga_bit> Shocker is easily my favorite D tier villain
[2:18:10] <Redblood801> Shocker makes his own tech too
[2:18:18] <$StaceMcGate> This doesn't look very light side
[2:18:20] <mihokspawn> This entire experience is enLightening
[2:18:24] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Shocker is the humble villain that always deserved better
[2:18:27] <%NWannabe> buggy my fave d tier

[2:18:49] <DSD24> I mean Fann’s killed like a 200 people today
[2:18:51] <giga_bit> Unless Mysterio also counts, but he's more like, C tier?
[2:18:56] <%NWannabe> lol @cerazor01 that theme song was fire
[2:19:01] <%Gruhunchously> So Light Side!
[2:19:03] <+jake5713> Don't forget about our boy, Kite Man.
[2:19:13] <+jake5713> Hell yeah.
[2:19:17] <Dangerzone979> Mysterio is S tier if the person writing him is creative
[2:19:20] <Redblood801> Oops
[2:19:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Mysterio ping pongs between power levels quite a bit
[2:19:27] <%Gruhunchously> You motherfucker
[2:19:57] <jorniev> for a jedi he is racking a fuckton of kills
[2:19:57] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:20:06] <%Gruhunchously> Poor Atton
[2:20:22] <Redblood801> Oh Atton
[2:20:26] <%Djinnazz> you two? thought Atton killed them?
[2:20:27] <%Irridium> Atton gets a line here if you brought him
[2:20:32] <cerazor01> You can have Mysterio
[2:20:33] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Atton couldn't bring himself to kill that much mucha shaka packa
[2:20:36] <cerazor01> But there's also Orb.
[2:20:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> Atton has been downgraded back to Barth
[2:20:42] <+ShadowArcangel> Atton is going through some stuff allright? give him a break =P
[2:20:50] <giga_bit> The next Nar Shadaa global census is gonna be looking a little light after this adventure.
[2:20:54] <cerazor01> Marvel thought it would be cool to make a character who is sexually attracted to eyeballs.
[2:20:57] <%NWannabe> oof the samage
[2:20:59] <Chuckgofer> "BITCH are you fo real?" 'Mooku shaaka paka?' "NOT YOU, ATTON"
[2:21:01] <%Gruhunchously> I thought you said you were good at killing women, Atton.
[2:21:08] <%NWannabe> Droids got this
[2:21:32] <%Gruhunchously> How embarrassing
[2:21:34] <DSD24> @gruhunchously he did say say Jedi
[2:21:41] <+Shackle_Rustyford> woolie
[2:21:44] <+Shackle_Rustyford> wheres the cube
[2:21:50] <%Pillagius> Well they had 2 sword each - so you took 1 every time. Kinda works :D
[2:21:56] <%NWannabe> Being inferior, as it always was
[2:22:01] <+gutlesscoward> he rejected the cube
[2:22:02] <cerazor01> Calo? How did you survive Taris?
[2:22:10] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Since we are almost done with Nar Shadaa I hope Dxun is next for reasons
[2:22:14] <%Djinnazz> fry'm
[2:22:20] <cerazor01> It takes more than a scratch to kill Calo Nord.
[2:22:26] <%Gruhunchously> That's cold as shit
[2:22:32] <cerazor01> But they glassed the planet!
[2:22:33] <%Gruhunchously> Paralyze, then shock
[2:22:35] <cerazor01> I was blown clear.
[2:22:42] <giga_bit> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon Same, there's some shit Woolie needs to see.
[2:22:43] <Chuckgofer> I have no force powers but I must scream
[2:22:54] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeahhhh dixon might be fun *cough cough*
[2:22:59] <megaminimechamocha> The Last Jedi was the best Star Wars Kappa
[2:23:06] <a_mad_dragon> G E T H U G E
[2:23:10] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Dxun*
[2:23:15] <%Gruhunchously> *Sad Revan noises
[2:23:22] <+Manjove> no it wasn't
[2:23:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Last jedi was easily the worst star wars film
[2:23:35] <+Shackle_Rustyford> so i started playing this for the first time recently, is it just me or is it a tad to easy?
[2:23:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes worse then Phantom
[2:23:45] <+Shackle_Rustyford> even on hard difficulty i kind of crush all encounters
[2:23:50] <megaminimechamocha> The Best Star Wars
[2:23:58] <%Gruhunchously> Make demolitiions a cross-class skill
[2:24:03] <megaminimechamocha> Empire is glazed shit compared to it
[2:24:09] <%NWannabe> best star wars is some tabletop i played once
[2:24:20] <%Gruhunchously> I guess Kreia was right on that point
[2:24:26] <$StaceMcGate> Best Star Wars is Wrath of Khan
[2:24:32] <%KnivesEve> Empire Strikes Back is the worst and ill die on this hill alone
[2:24:33] <giga_bit> @Shackle_Rustyford the game kind of crumbles if you have a general idea of what you're doing
[2:24:47] <%NWannabe> is chat picking fights with itself rn?
[2:24:49] <+Shackle_Rustyford> i went for a melee heavy build
[2:24:58] <+Shackle_Rustyford> things rarely last beyond a single swing
[2:24:59] <megaminimechamocha> Rose is a better character than any character in the OG Trilogy
[2:25:10] <+Manjove> ok, you are trolling
[2:25:13] <%Gruhunchously> Them's fighting words
[2:25:18] <+Manjove> that is what is happening
[2:25:18] <megaminimechamocha> Rose is a better character than Thrawn
[2:25:22] <megaminimechamocha> Thrawn is shit
[2:25:34] <giga_bit> ok now we're just throwing jokes around
[2:25:39] <%NWannabe> she better than fazma...i think?
[2:25:49] <%Pillagius> hahahaha

[2:26:05] <Chuckgofer> Its star wars, no one dies
[2:26:12] <+ShadowArcangel> Are you saying that a bunch of droids runned the Y'Toub System?
[2:26:12] <megaminimechamocha> Thrawn is shit and bad and low tier, and if the books had been made into movies they would have sucked even worse than the prequels.
[2:26:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> UHHHHHHH
[2:26:21] <subjectg> Goto, the kizuna ai of the galaxy

[2:26:37] <Chuckgofer> MORE DROID PARTY MEMBERS!
[2:26:41] <megaminimechamocha> The only character better than Rose is Skippy the Jedi Droid
[2:26:44] <+TheFabledAble> dat droid is an absolute UNIT
[2:26:49] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Kreia is so done with this ship being full of dumbasses
[2:26:53] <+MidnightBurst12> Big ball droid

[2:27:32] <a_mad_dragon> G0-T0 jail

[2:27:40] <Chuckgofer> Vibrate only
[2:27:40] <Graxe_> I'm sorry, G0-T0
[2:27:44] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> It would just start zapping you with morse code

[2:42:33] <cerazor01> Warrior with a Mask, SUB ZERO!
[2:42:37] <+RowenCleric> thats a Jojo reference I think
[2:42:41] <grandark_z317> @lotharrio then you're not that one friend.
[2:43:23] <+ShadowArcangel> I think that's the sort of thing like being able to see souls and then you see a life form in front of you that you know for sure doesn't have one or lost his/her
[2:43:28] <+RowenCleric> I genuinely love Woolie and V philosophy hours

[2:43:29] <DatAsuna> I'm that friend but people weirdly decide it's about the things that aren't even in my top 3
[2:43:29] <+MidnightBurst12> They base their entire understanding of the universe through the force

[2:48:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:48:07] <DatAsuna> malak really wanted that jarael time
[2:48:08] <+slimmixrp> This shit here is why I love this game
[2:48:08] <+ShadowArcangel> If Zayne hadn't cucked Malak, Malak would have been a good guy probably
[2:48:19] <%Eaglestrike117> Which one? The one with the Rakghoul Necklace thing?
[2:48:29] <Divryne> OKAY BOOMER.
[2:48:32] <DatAsuna> Malak was so mad he went MGTow
[2:48:47] <%Gruhunchously> This is the good shit right here
[2:48:49] <grandark_z317> what does mgtow mean anyway?
[2:49:02] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> 'Men going their own way' it's some incel shit
[2:49:03] <DatAsuna> "men going their own way"
[2:49:03] <cerazor01> Kappa Kappa
[2:49:07] <%NWannabe> Kappa
[2:49:10] <jorniev> ZAYNE cucked malak !?
[2:49:18] <DatAsuna> basically angry incels but without the involuntary bit
[2:49:19] <+democrazyyy> WOOLIE IS IN
[2:49:19] <PlumpPotatoRump> loool

[2:49:44] <PlumpPotatoRump> YE YE YE!
[2:49:46] <grandark_z317> I thought it was "Men Getting Tired of Women," but voluntary celibacy seems legit.
[2:49:47] <%Irridium> this could NEVER exist in disney-world
[2:49:47] <%bigmacjack12> Man woolie needs to read the kotor comic books to get more of what he wanted
[2:49:47] <%NWannabe> Diney cannae
[2:49:48] <carlosmiyamoto> It’s more interesting than killing them
[2:49:56] <+TheREALHoratio> yeah
[2:49:58] <giga_bit> INSIGHT GAINED
[2:49:58] <+MidnightBurst12> Best Star Wars story concept
[2:50:01] <Heyestus> Lmao imagine a game like this under Disney
[2:50:01] <+ShadowArcangel> I don't think "Ehhhh" is the word for this playtrough, I think "Fascinating!" is the word for this playtrough
[2:50:03] <%Gruhunchously> THE HYPE IS ON
[2:50:03] <+TheREALHoratio> Chris Avalone is a geniius
[2:50:05] <grandark_z317> too bad Disney hates moral greys.
[2:50:05] <+MidnightBurst12> EXACTLY
[2:50:05] <+democrazyyy> WE HAVE 3+ PLANETS TO GO
[2:50:07] <Tucker0603> DISNEY SUCKS ASS
[2:50:07] <+Superspider51> Kotor is peak star wars
[2:50:10] <atema128> Obsidian games are basically always about broken people.
[2:50:16] <+shapeforn> ugh.. sadly it's also sorts George Lucas' fault, he thinks its black and white morality
[2:50:16] <+ShadowArcangel> Ah, the you are learning
[2:50:18] <%NWannabe> "Are you a Jedi?" "Fascinating." ???
[2:50:20] <%Pillagius> Yea, but some people don't give a flying fuck about lore...
[2:50:23] <DatAsuna> sadly i don't see him making time for like 50 issues of comics
[2:50:31] <%NWannabe> But merch tho!
[2:50:34] <grandark_z317> don't worry James. There won't be.
[2:50:39] <Chuckgofer> They just write what they know. Beiung broken
[2:50:39] <%CEGold> Im 100% willing to give High republic a chance
[2:50:40] <%Irridium> yeah but I doubt disney will allow that. Could hurt *the brand*
[2:50:45] <%Pillagius> And so we have the "new trillogy"
[2:50:46] <%Gruhunchously> THis game is all about the B sides
[2:50:54] <$StaceMcGate> I have no faith in the High Republic
[2:50:55] <DatAsuna> i have hopes but not expectations for HR
[2:50:59] <cerazor01> The Hugh Eraa
[2:51:03] <%bigmacjack12> Hey woolie, want to read a Jedi story about the biggest coverup probably ever?
[2:51:05] <london_flexing> Mickey Mouse: "But my brand"
[2:51:06] <%Eaglestrike117> The lost stars author is in high republic, so im cautiously optimistic
[2:51:10] <DatAsuna> ready to be pleased but won't be shocked if i ain't
[2:51:18] <%Eaglestrike117> Cause she wrote lost stars and the obi wan book
[2:51:20] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus My problem with him is that while he admits the jedi failed, He thinks the root of the Jedi failings was some "wound" or "corruption" in the force. In other words the Jedi teachings would work if the force was purified. Which is some bullshit malarky to save his pride and give reason to his cowardice.
[2:51:22] <DatAsuna> no losing this way
[2:51:22] <cerazor01> FrankerZ
[2:51:26] <Jmann1892> Exile Did NOTHING WRONG
[2:51:28] <jorniev> you dont even need to go too dark to make it as good as it can be
[2:51:34] <giga_bit> The entire concept of Sith was spawned because the Jedi exist.
[2:51:37] <fidorulz> How about star wars comedy? Star Wars IT crowd but on the death star
[2:51:39] <jorniev> so i dont now disneys excuse
[2:51:52] <DatAsuna> well kotor balance is at odds with lucas balance
[2:52:02] <grandark_z317> @jorniev there is no excuse, they just don't care.
[2:52:07] <DatAsuna> george lucas says balance is no dark side at all
[2:52:10] <Tucker0603> meanwhile my sith assassin in SWTOR just wants peace for all
[2:52:19] <+shapeforn> fable I don't think he was saying that was it, just that it was in addition to
[2:52:36] <+Superspider51> to be fair Lucas also greenlit Jar Jar
[2:52:37] <%CEGold> Stuff like Clone Wars and Mandalorian gives me hope for Star Wars. There is good left in the franchise. Just keep the mouse out of the kitchen
[2:52:46] <%CEGold> We aint Ratatouille
[2:52:52] <DatAsuna> oh lucas has many bad ideas
[2:52:57] <%Eaglestrike117> Disregard Micky, Acquire Dave Filoni
[2:53:07] <+Superspider51> Filoni is our last hope
[2:53:07] <Jmann1892> The Jedi need the Sith around to keep them Honest
[2:53:08] <DatAsuna> but lucas rules define the movie era
[2:53:22] <DatAsuna> filoni plays by lucas rule of balance too
[2:53:27] <grandark_z317> Luke was looking for his immediate family, that's why he tried murdering his nephew.
[2:53:28] <%NWannabe> that is why i cannot care for SW @DatAsuna
[2:53:37] <grandark_z317> looking out*
[2:53:38] <+shapeforn> Lucas proved that he's a great big picture man, but his ideas for hard rules are super dumb
[2:53:39] <hellkhat> starwars fanfic will always be better imo
[2:53:41] <%Gruhunchously> It's a long way off, but I can't WAIT for the Korriban cave
[2:53:46] <DatAsuna> filoni uses a lot of George's worse ideas

[2:56:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh. how did he get his power from
[2:56:29] <PlumpPotatoRump> The Wills "Ite say less"
[2:56:30] <Heyestus> @Pillagius more "we did it to someone else once, but not you."
[2:56:39] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Kreia A SHIT
[2:56:40] <%NWannabe> kreia never lies
[2:56:42] <%Eaglestrike117> Yup, Ulic went off the deep end and it had to be done
[2:56:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> and Qel Droma is the guy who died in the tarantatek lair in Korriban right?
[2:56:54] <+TheREALHoratio> yes
[2:56:55] <DatAsuna> no' that was a relative
[2:57:03] <%Pillagius> @Heyestus yea, pretty much
[2:57:05] <+TheREALHoratio> Wasnt it Ullic
[2:57:07] <DatAsuna> ulic qel droma was in episode 0

[2:57:38] <jorniev> your bond with the force was severed with the cuffs
[2:57:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> there's a Qel Droma corpse with a robe in the tarantatek cave in Korriban in Kotor 1
[2:57:46] <slatersev> Yes
[2:57:49] <atema128> Kreia said they did, outright. Not implied, she is the one who says “perhaps the damage they did can be undone” and then puts the idea in your head.
[2:57:51] <slatersev> his cousin Duron
[2:57:54] <DatAsuna> yes, but not ulic
[2:57:54] <DSD24> Wow really?
[2:57:58] <%NWannabe> bitch
[2:58:13] <DatAsuna> ulic died years before
[2:58:19] <%Gruhunchously> There need to be less Jedi secrets, but I'm gonna keep this secret.

[3:01:36] <%bigmacjack12> bigmacjack12 gifted a Tier 1 sub to taggerung403!
[3:01:46] <DatAsuna> kotor de ided EVERYTHING star wars was invented in one generation
[3:01:46] <%Gruhunchously> That was a close one
[3:01:47] <slatersev> the Kotor prequel comic is still the best
[3:01:53] <slatersev> Zayne is the boi
[3:01:54] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> 2
[3:01:58] <slatersev> even Avellone liked it
[3:02:01] <%taggerung403> @bigmacjack12 cheers m8
[3:02:06] <DatAsuna> it's the busiest fastest advance ever
[3:02:09] <%bigmacjack12> The kotor comics are god tier
[3:02:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:02:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> do you mean the Rakata?
[3:02:20] <%Gruhunchously> *Four people
[3:02:21] <+ShadowArcangel> Zayne and his story is a fantastic story
[3:02:32] <DatAsuna> almost every piece of tech was made post exar kun
[3:02:38] <JaceIsEpic> have they decided a planet order?
[3:02:38] <cerazor01> Honestly if you told the story of the Rakata to this fella, he might reconsider his stance.
[3:02:41] <DatAsuna> it's very silly
[3:02:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> so it was all made int he past 40 years
[3:02:47] <%Gruhunchously> You kill even one Master, and it's Dark Side for the rest of the game.
[3:02:50] <%bigmacjack12> Woolie would love reading it cause damn
[3:02:53] <DatAsuna> onderon will be second for sure
[3:02:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> also give me an example of a new tech, DatAsuna
[3:03:07] <%bigmacjack12> There’s some big cover ups
[3:03:10] <Chuckgofer> I'm all about THESE POCKETS
[3:03:14] <DatAsuna> holo communicators
[3:03:20] <DatAsuna> the holo net
[3:03:24] <giga_bit> @JaceIsEpic I'm assuming the order is Nar Shadda - Onderon - Dantooine - Korriban
[3:03:26] <%bigmacjack12> He wants some fucked up jedi bullshit
[3:03:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> is that a thing in kotor or is that post-kotor
[3:03:37] <carlosmiyamoto> Eh, because video game
[3:03:39] <MaverickJoker> we jedi
[3:03:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> is Freedon Nadd in the comics?
[3:03:43] <DatAsuna> it's in kotor dude
[3:03:43] <slatersev> some of those things existed still even in the Tales comics
[3:03:45] <MaverickJoker> WE jedi
[3:03:52] <slatersev> they were just very diffirently drawn
[3:04:01] <DatAsuna> you were talking about holocalls in this game earlier
[3:04:06] <slatersev> but the Ulic/Exar comics varied widly in quality
[3:04:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> does he really kill more jedi than anyone with his gun?
[3:04:16] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> !uptime
[3:04:16] <slatersev> both art and writing
[3:04:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 4 minutes
[3:04:27] <socratetris> So... not caught up to the let's play... but still here live. Someone summarize EVERYTHING!
[3:04:29] <DatAsuna> goto is a character that communicates exclusively in holograms
[3:04:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh yeah holograms
[3:04:40] <DatAsuna> yeah the comics have big flaws
[3:04:45] <jorniev> i wonder why
[3:04:47] <DatAsuna> naga sadow sucks
[3:04:47] <%Irridium> cleetus is alright
[3:04:56] <%Pillagius> This guy slowly but surely become more and more likable
[3:05:00] <DatAsuna> he has some okay on paper traits
[3:05:04] <Chuckgofer> Really on point that master boomhauer "Dont know about no hate"
[3:05:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> @socratetris this moustachio'd jedi is good people
[3:05:12] <DatAsuna> but sadow needs a heavy rewrite
[3:05:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> does he shoot people though?
[3:05:20] <%Gruhunchously> This guy did a big turn around didn't he
[3:05:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Master Handl'Ebars
[3:05:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> his gun is said to have "killed more jedi than any lightsaber"
[3:05:35] <%jiggy_snipe> wow a Jedi who actually wants to learn why things happen?!
[3:05:39] <%kyh9> He came back voluntarily
[3:05:41] <Chuckgofer> He may not be jedi but hes still big blue to me <3
[3:05:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> "Sure lets fight"
[3:06:17] <+Manjove> he is a complete Nihilist now
[3:06:21] <Parapattern> "You guys wanna start a fight?"
[3:06:32] <+TheREALHoratio> Well, this will be interestinig
[3:06:32] <MaverickJoker> i mean, he did live his whole life a lie
[3:06:33] <$StaceMcGate> Woolie is loving the story
[3:06:37] <MaverickJoker> brainwashing lie
[3:06:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Manjove Say what you will about the Sith. At least it's an ethos.
[3:06:39] <%lotharrio> Pretty powerful, with a unique super Force power.
[3:06:49] <+TheREALHoratio> Ez Kai El would get beat down quickly at his level
[3:06:53] <%kyh9> Came back to the cave
[3:06:55] <+MrBaldachin> that's good protagonist material
[3:07:00] <mr_sups> LET'S TALK
[3:07:00] <giga_bit> You showed up, and despite that, they STILL told you to fuck off
[3:07:01] <DSD24> and instead you got exiled instead
[3:07:02] <+CycloneEternalJoker> Turned up at the door like WHATS REALLY GOOD
[3:08:24] <MaverickJoker> but the jedi way is the true way Kappa
[3:09:05] <kulmoth> Do they realize that they picked a darkside dialogue option?
[3:09:16] <%CEGold> Shhhh Kappa
[3:09:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:09:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> which one
[3:09:28] <%Gruhunchously> Daryl Davis, yeah
[3:09:28] <%lotharrio> They asked a question, thinking they knew the answer. They didn't get what they wanted, so they tried to think of a new question to ask.
[3:09:34] <grandark_z317> Darryl Davis is fucking epic.
[3:09:43] <+TheREALHoratio> get on with it
[3:09:46] <GUDDAY12> Greater good
[3:09:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> WBC
[3:09:54] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Westboro
[3:09:58] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Westboro
[3:09:59] <%Djinnazz> Westburo
[3:10:00] <TigerClaws12> Woolie "Just Talk" Madden
[3:10:02] <%Gruhunchously> Westboro Baptsist Church
[3:10:13] <MaverickJoker> oh right, naruto's greatest power and woolie's favorite: Just Talk LUL
[3:10:15] <+Hinasil> Flat earthers are just "science experts" that for some reason are given a less credible position in society, because reasons
[3:10:35] <%jiggy_snipe> does Woolie like Steven Universe? lol
[3:10:36] <MaverickJoker> took me a second to click
[3:10:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The problem with trying to use that for the WBC though is that they've always been frauds, they're conmen who just wanted to provoke people so they could then hide behind litigation.
[3:10:44] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Atris sucking her lightsaber
[3:10:51] <+TheREALHoratio> ATris is the worst
[3:10:52] <%Irridium> she just sets the hilt between her legs
[3:10:58] <mr_sups> Hey kids, you want some Darkness?
[3:11:04] <DatAsuna> that's in the comics too
[3:11:06] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> lightsaber dildos
[3:11:25] <%bigmacjack12> Gotta read the comics woolie
[3:11:26] <%Gruhunchously> As we established, Jedi Masters are dumb
[3:11:31] <MaverickJoker> if v isn't here, and pat is, you can guess all of this would be dark side, the argument i mean LUL
[3:11:32] <grandark_z317> the SACRED JEDI TEXTS
[3:11:34] <+TheFabledAble> the sacred texts!
[3:11:37] <Darkrenai> Sacred texts are sacred for a reason, never question, just accept
[3:11:37] <+memequisition> the Jedi failed ahsoka and she didn't become a sith
[3:11:39] <Darkrenai> LUL
[3:11:40] <DSD24> I like 3 personally
[3:11:44] <DatAsuna> the jedi covenant was the most dumb tho
[3:11:54] <DatAsuna> WE DO THO
[3:11:56] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:12:06] <cerazor01> If Pat was here, he would turn this arguement into a total shitshow
[3:12:09] <DSD24> Play Jedi Academy 2!
[3:12:12] <slatersev> the Covenant was great
[3:12:15] <slatersev> the perfect concept
[3:12:16] <+TheREALHoratio> They did
[3:12:19] <DatAsuna> yes legends did that
[3:12:23] <%bigmacjack12> The Jedi covenant was good in theory, then turned out fucked
[3:12:28] <%Eaglestrike117> yeah they did
[3:12:28] <+TheREALHoratio> The books are sooooo much better
[3:12:30] <grandark_z317> @cerazor01 he would, and everyone would hate it.
[3:12:31] <+shapeforn> I think it's worth remembering that the jedi serve an important purpose yall
[3:12:32] <carlosmiyamoto> It happened already
[3:12:34] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Since TOR went free to play it'd be interesting if Woolie played SWTOR
[3:12:34] <%bigmacjack12> Cause secret dark side
[3:12:34] <Tucker0603> THE EU SHIT WAS GREAT
[3:12:35] <slatersev> he did in Legends
[3:12:42] <%taggerung403> NJO was pretty good
[3:12:44] <Tucker0603> those books were good
[3:12:46] <privatesargent> in Legends he basically had to make the Jedi Order again from the ground up, since most of the sources were gone
[3:12:48] <%taggerung403> yuzhan vong aside
[3:12:51] <Heyestus> it's probably better in the jedi knight series anyway
[3:12:54] <DSD24> The Jedi sacred texts!
[3:12:56] <slatersev> He did in the EU
[3:12:57] <DatAsuna> Yes V
[3:12:58] <%Eaglestrike117> From what i remember i think luke said "Fuck all this no attachment bullshit, im gonna fuck my hot redhead wife now"
[3:12:59] <privatesargent> he adopted what he could, and made up the rest
[3:13:01] <Katorskay> "Love that neighbor" that's cool "you can sell your daughter" FUCK THAT
[3:13:02] <+Superspider51> that's exactly what he did in the EU
[3:13:06] <DatAsuna> That's why canon luke sucks, he couldn't imagine change
[3:13:12] <%Gruhunchously> In a way, this guy is like Luke in The Last Jedi
[3:13:13] <%kyh9> Luke in the books is just OP
[3:13:14] <Jmann1892> Luke worked so hard to make the Jedi better than before
[3:13:14] <slatersev> he got married
[3:13:17] <%bigmacjack12> “Canon”
[3:13:22] <DatAsuna> he had 30 years to imagine the idea of changing even 1 rule
[3:13:23] <carlosmiyamoto> Luke did do that
[3:13:28] <%Irridium> yeah go into the books. learn about Luuuke. And no I did not misspell that.
[3:13:31] <%Gruhunchously> He realized the flaws of the Jedi, but instead of correcting them he just chose apathy.
[3:13:37] <%bigmacjack12> canon Luke is EU Luke
[3:13:51] <+TheREALHoratio> the Disney films are not canon, EU forever
[3:13:56] <DSD24> I hate Luke in Last Jedi
[3:14:01] <%bigmacjack12> FACTS
[3:14:03] <MaverickJoker> luke pulled a ben kenobi
[3:14:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> if he killed Sidious would he really have become evil?
[3:14:10] <grandark_z317> @dsd24 good, everyone should.
[3:14:14] <+KevGuuey> I didn't know Woolie had a Stream doodStare
[3:14:16] <%kyh9> He'd be pretty cool
[3:14:33] <Tucker0603> EU FOREVER, FUCK DISNEY
[3:14:45] <%bigmacjack12> Destroy Disney
[3:14:46] <DSD24> I am playing Jedi Academy and Luke is cool in that game
[3:14:54] <+KevGuuey> Darkseid? doodKen
[3:14:56] <giga_bit> It's funny because Luke is probably the best character in TLJ, but he's still absolutely awful.
[3:14:57] <DSD24> Doing some Atton shit there
[3:14:59] <+shapeforn> god a slightly more reigned in EU post ep 6 movie series would be kismet
[3:15:05] <neilgilbertg97> Do a Reiner are we?
[3:15:05] <Heyestus> To be fair Luke only really learned what Yoda taught him, and Yoda seemed like he'd given up on a lot of the traditionalist Jedi stuff @WoolieVersus
[3:15:11] <+ShadowArcangel> Dark side goes Dark in this game and I love it
[3:15:11] <%Gruhunchously> He does tho
[3:15:14] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> he does not swing at you on 3
[3:15:15] <cerazor01> I play Dark Side Twilek with dual lightsabres in Jedi Academy 2.
[3:15:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> Yoda burned all those books
[3:15:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> DUN DUN DUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNN
[3:15:22] <%Irridium> @Heyestus And Luke was only at Yoda's for like, a week.
[3:15:29] <+KevGuuey> So who's sitting next to Woolie?
[3:15:30] <DSD24> I play a cool Rodian with a Saber Staff
[3:15:31] <slatersev> Yuzhan Vong with some proper editing would have been perfect, or Thrawn
[3:15:36] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> you do get darkside points though
[3:15:45] <%Eaglestrike117> Remember that fuckin badass Jedi
[3:15:55] <%Eaglestrike117> who killed so many vong he became THEIR BOOGYMAN?
[3:15:57] <Kivros> mind control revan
[3:16:00] <%Pillagius> @DSD24 yea and Kyle Katarn who got cut out from Rogue 1 not bad as well
[3:16:01] <+Superspider51> wouldn't really have been Revan's choice as she was memory wiped
[3:16:08] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> THROUGH WHOOPASS
[3:16:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> FUCKFIGHT

[3:17:52] <+TheREALHoratio> Vrook is not okay
[3:17:57] <+ShadowArcangel> the technique depends on your class can be a ligthsaber/force technique
