[0:05:32] <Blank9> nioh 2 is infinite game
[0:05:32] <%ThisIsLloyd> also 13 sentinels
[0:05:35] <%ChoculaUltra> my main gripe with the multiplayer is that there's no dedicated servers
[0:05:36] <+b_aleph> know what's sicker? guilty gear
[0:05:45] <JetpackMcQuack> star wars overload
[0:05:47] <@Menitta> Nioh 2 has a fist weapon and its amazing
[0:05:51] <DatAsuna> Squadrons launched at $40
[0:05:52] <%ChoculaUltra> so if you have a friend who made/hosted the server, you can't be on that same server unless they're online
[0:06:19] <%gatorafan> B daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:06:21] <JetpackMcQuack> Squadrons is the second best star wars game of the decade

[0:07:06] <DatAsuna> but yeah it's a bit short/light on content
[0:07:07] <leith_aziz> What happened ?
[0:07:15] <whiteblacklight74> everything is metallica's fault because pat said it
[0:07:16] <Afroperonista> metallica still trash LUL
[0:07:23] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder Metallica was one the first bands to spearhead the movement against Napster.

[0:12:34] <leith_aziz> I watched it dub, i belive its og good quality
[0:12:35] <Darren716> I'd also rather have the ESRB than the Australian, German, or Japanese ratings boards
[0:12:36] <Darren716> Like fuck

[0:13:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Japan a country with a VERY bloody history doesn't tolerate gore? WAT?
[0:13:35] <Astrophizz> how Japanese albums always get unique tracks to justify the crazy costs

[0:26:32] <%Juriasu> sub gang
[0:26:34] <+Ancopro> oh god subs dubs
[0:26:34] <Zayasu> dub is worse LUL
[0:26:36] <Prevot> LUL
[0:26:36] <+Stupid121v2> Dub is 10/10
[0:26:37] <+Aldesso> lol
[0:26:38] <leith_aziz> I dont know, I used the dub
[0:26:39] <primaryfire> dog the dr1 dub is horriblr
[0:26:39] <%Exiliator> Yeah dub is way worse LUL
[0:26:40] <+BusterRepukken> people pay money to argue lmao
[0:26:43] <Zebroneath> those pesky opinions
[0:26:46] <leith_aziz> I liked it
[0:26:48] <Felto3> dub is worse
[0:26:56] <leith_aziz> But yes, NOT on the same level
[0:26:57] <%psidefx> Its pretty mid to be honest
[0:26:58] <OldManDeckardCain> if they don't say dattebayo, it FUCKIN SUCKS Kappa
[0:27:01] <%aram909> and yakuza
[0:27:01] <%X2Eliah> Yakuza 7 dub is GREAT
[0:27:03] <leith_aziz> I admit that
[0:27:04] <+MosesUnspoken> Danganronpa is fine
[0:27:07] <+Stupid121v2> V3 dub is so good god damn
[0:27:08] <leith_aziz> Yakuza too
[0:27:09] <OblivionSword1> Yakuza like a dragon Dub is really good
[0:27:10] <@Menitta> Yakuza 7's dub is so good
[0:27:13] <@Squdnate> Yakuza 7's dub is so fucking good
[0:27:18] <srv4254> heres 50 dollars u eat dumb peanut butter
[0:27:19] <leith_aziz> I'll give V3 an exception
[0:27:19] <@Menitta> Judgment's dub is also incredible
[0:27:23] <leith_aziz> THAT is good
[0:27:24] <DatAsuna> Macross OG dub was god tier tbh
[0:27:25] <%0rond> dubs get worse the more characters there are, since the pool of VAs that get hired is still relatively small
[0:27:27] <%ZweihanderSteve> late 90's ish
[0:27:27] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie didn't watch Cowboy Bebop bt
[0:27:27] <@Squdnate> I even like it more than original japanese dub, to some degree
[0:27:27] <+runegod20> 7 has a pretty damn good dub, think I'd rather sub but it's a super valid way to play it
[0:27:27] <%Mrbaconator> yakuza 7s dub is AMAZING
[0:27:29] <%LastHazzerd> who's the asshole who donated this message?
[0:27:29] <+Jiggisnipe> btw*
[0:27:30] <+Stupid121v2> also modern funimation dubs are so boring and bland imo
[0:27:31] <majindusto> Remember the Must video awards anti Napster skit with Lars Ulrich and Marlon Wayans?
[0:27:31] <RyuuAoi> Mothafuckas making movies out here
[0:27:34] <+McSoliace> Y7 dub is actually perfect
[0:27:35] <@Menitta> It starts and ends with 4kids Yugioh
[0:27:38] <Mattais88> When Kill la Kill came out in eng
[0:27:38] <Karego_at> the y7 dub is better tha average yea, still think most of the voices don't fit, esp majima
[0:27:43] <%LastHazzerd> cuz how often is woolie gonna have to explain this
[0:27:43] <leith_aziz> I played Y7 in dub
[0:27:43] <majindusto> *Music video awards
[0:27:45] <%blaccbird914> I second like a dragon
[0:27:45] <+thecraye> Yakuza 7's dub is straight up better
[0:27:45] <%spuddnyk> As good as 7's dub is I can't do it
[0:27:46] <Timarkot> Oh boy we are getting Y7 sub aren't we
[0:27:48] <+Stupid121v2> Much prefer bad 90's anime dubs
[0:27:49] <whiteblacklight74> I'm not sure if 13 Sentinels dub is really good or if it's just because Woolie has friends doing rhe VA
[0:27:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh cmon, Pat already played Yakuza 7 dub, play it sub
[0:27:52] <RyuuAoi> Sonic X best dub
[0:27:57] <chainsaw105> Yakuza 7's dub is good except for SPECIFICALLY ichiban's karaoke song
[0:27:57] <$vectorcannonready> Xenoblade 2.....
[0:28:03] <+Chronobot> when they decided "Hey, these guys ALSO have money we can take"
[0:28:04] <Solidnick18> i can't do that for yakuza just cause i started sub and it's so good and iconic. but the dub is good
[0:28:06] <syanplague> i guess for me is ok since even dub is not dub
[0:28:07] <whiteblacklight74> like sometimes it blows me away but others TIME TO PUT ON A SHOW FOR YUKI-CHANG
[0:28:08] <%psidefx> Eat da poopoo
[0:28:09] <Karego_at> hope they won't play the dub it's okay but og is always better
[0:28:11] <%Exiliator> But Japanese is cool? I dont want to just understand what they are saying, I want to hear them speak cool words!
[0:28:12] <%aram909> @Karego_at majim a was voiced by matt mercer doing a good mark hammill impression
[0:28:16] <%jinking79> The Future
[0:28:16] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:28:19] <+Deko_> we back PogChamp
[0:28:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> If you gonna pretend like Ichiban isnt Nishikis VA get out of my fac
[0:28:21] <%superc37> THE BAD KAKOAKE IS WHAT MAKES IT GOOD THO
[0:28:22] <leith_aziz> Guys, its opinions at the end of the day
[0:28:24] <%aram909> because mark hammill did the original yak1 dub, honestly imo i think it fits well
[0:28:25] <%Irridium> Xenoblade 2's is incredible I love it
[0:28:28] <%psidefx> We in there boiz
[0:28:29] <+BusterRepukken> maybe dont talk about Y7 shit when woolie is about to paly it
[0:28:31] <leith_aziz> Dont take it seriously
[0:28:32] <%RyTYoung> Still in the world of Kiryu I see
[0:28:34] <Mattais88> Controller disconnected?
[0:28:36] <Afroperonista> got a mic?
[0:28:39] <$dudedude55555> plot or estate? what will it be
[0:28:41] <@Menitta> yeah the Yakuza 1 dub is a prime reason to not play the PS2 version. Hammill included
[0:28:41] <GarbageNirvana> It's still not terrible tho
[0:28:42] <fIashman92> The bad karokae is in fact better
[0:28:42] <%X2Eliah> SO DID YOU GRID THE BUSINESS???
[0:28:46] <KaironFortressKnight> bad karaoke is way more believably
[0:28:57] <winner_92> @aram909 mark hamill doing majima and then forgetting about it is still hilarious to me
[0:28:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> no fuck off Ichibans japanese karaoke is way better
[0:28:58] <@Menitta> Oh god I'm playing Xenoblade 2 and I fucking love the dub
[0:28:58] <RyuuAoi> Shogi plot today?
[0:28:59] <fIashman92> YOU'RE KILLING IT
[0:29:01] <@Menitta> Its so charming
[0:29:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Fuck that, thats like saying all karaoke before the dub sucks
[0:29:10] <%LastHazzerd> a blue and orange
[0:29:17] <leith_aziz> Karoake is kinda bad, but its funny as it makes you releaze the protaganists arent natural singers
[0:29:23] <@Menitta> Just put a big red and blue filter on both cameras
[0:29:27] <GarbageNirvana> Xenoblade 2's dub is hilarious
[0:29:36] <leith_aziz> And i kinda like that

[0:31:38] <@Menitta> I say this in advance. Chat please behave.
[0:31:40] <+runegod20> so did they have the tech of land line phones with wireless back in the 80s?

[0:31:50] <+runegod20> since that's not a cellphone judging by the bottom
[0:31:52] <+Balkespower> That failed save glitch happened to me twice in 90 hours, so it is kinda rare. That glitch only causes the game to not save at that point, so no worries.
[0:31:55] <OblivionSword1> Let's kill Kiryu that's a great idea Kappa

[0:32:32] <+Balkespower> Riki is such a good actor in general
[0:32:32] <+runegod20> it feels weird to hear someone say aniki in a yakuza game without it being translated
[0:32:33] <+Ancopro> i think its kazamas office

[0:38:21] <leith_aziz> OOOFFFF
[0:38:23] <%illtima> I remember years ago reading some lore from some Yakuza PSP game. Supposedly the reason why every punk tries to fight Kiryu despite his reputation is because it's kind of a hazing ritual for newbies
[0:38:24] <whiteblacklight74> turn on beast

[0:40:21] <%X2Eliah> 2
[0:40:23] <leith_aziz> Nice attention to detail that shows Kiryu's impulsiveness
[0:40:24] <%X2Eliah> 1
[0:40:26] <@Menitta> WOIW
[0:40:27] <+Manderson1998> Two things. Has Woolie done his beast and rush training? woolie needs to also charge his beast attacks by holding.
[0:40:28] <%big_laser_boss> Remember to cancel end-lag by style-changing. That's the reason you use the Quick-change clothes
[0:40:38] <+BusterRepukken> big laser boss, you got issues
[0:40:38] <+Williamld> Finely, not sturdily crafted
[0:40:39] <dukenux> damn
[0:40:48] <digitalslime> @Manderson1998 at least some beast training
[0:40:49] <%big_laser_boss> indeed I do
[0:40:49] <%Lion_kun> Sunburst sword sounds like a dark souls weapon.
[0:40:52] <brunoberserk> maybe kiryu is TOO STRONG for the sword
[0:40:54] <+EdenOfLove> Drops are getting worse @WoolieVersus
[0:40:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> shank em
[0:41:02] <+BusterRepukken> you're in here every stream and spam the same shit.
[0:41:06] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Charge your beast attacks!!
[0:41:14] <+Manderson1998> This is before Kiryu learns how to use a sword
[0:41:18] <Solidnick18> that blood squirt
[0:41:21] <+vaderxyz1970> Or maybe Kyriu is just to powerful for that sword
[0:41:21] <downwiththethickness99> This is why Beast is essential to speedrunning. Beast would clear this shit out in like 10 seconds
[0:41:29] <%DashXero> These people are miraculously not dead.
[0:41:36] <+KillMyPast> Pls just use the quick change Woolie
[0:41:38] <%big_laser_boss> there we go
[0:41:45] <+vaderxyz1970> Or maybe Kyriu is using the sword like a hammer
[0:41:47] <+Tucker0603> frame drops present
[0:41:55] <+EdenOfLove> @WoolieVersus frame drops for real
[0:41:56] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just power walk through town
[0:42:00] <+rubeSandwich> does woolie have a favorite style between the 6 in this game yet?
[0:42:01] <SherlockianHero> *jams out to music*
[0:42:04] <leith_aziz> Beast was fun at the start, but becomes boringly OP later on
[0:42:04] <%Exiliator> Did the suit clean itself when you switched style?
[0:42:14] <%r0chelimit> guys. seriously. woolie is doing fine. chill and let him play the damn game

[0:43:05] <%Asuterisuku> I'm pretty sure Kiryu has a negative body count at this rate.

[0:43:07] <%ChoculaUltra> always make an example of the big dude
[0:43:11] <foxname96> @woolieversus A lot of dropped frames

[0:43:58] <leith_aziz> OOf the frames...
[0:44:00] <%Halospaz117> @downwiththethickness99 This beatdown is where he got the inspiration for Jojo
[0:44:00] <@Commando_Joe> why use fist when you can use gun
[0:44:01] <Mattais88> Find a bike. Bike solves all problems
[0:44:07] <%Asuterisuku> That guy went on to make JoJo
[0:44:13] <+vaporousTippler> Didn't know Woolie was into PSO.
[0:44:17] <leith_aziz> Jedi Kiryu
[0:44:18] <+runegod20> ooo, the photon blade has a stun effect
[0:44:21] <%X2Eliah> I'm not noticing any dropped frames, but im watching in 360p due to slow internet so ymmv
[0:44:26] <MyNameIsRasus> No weapon is stronger than bike
[0:44:27] <RyuuAoi> Sick
[0:44:27] <whiteblacklight74> i-frames
[0:44:29] <+runegod20> that's actually super good on rush since they have a heat move against stunned guys
[0:44:30] <velgaduere> no dropped frames here
[0:44:31] <%big_laser_boss> oh look; a guard-break without a follow up. Sure would be nice if there was a way to change that
[0:44:32] <@Menitta> Im not seeing any frame drops at all.
[0:44:36] <whiteblacklight74> grab someone
[0:44:36] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus Which difficulty are you in again?
[0:44:39] <Lancaster_H> yeah there are some dropped frames occassionally
[0:44:40] <Wofoeh> Just to make sure
[0:44:41] <Rawbone_saw> THE BIKE
[0:44:42] <leith_aziz> I think the drops sropped
[0:44:42] <+EdenOfLove> yeah
[0:44:44] <digitalslime> im seeing some for sure
[0:44:45] <+Tucker0603> @woolieversus we're getting frame drops as bad as I drop my combos
[0:44:47] <velgaduere> it's on your end, One Guy
[0:44:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He‚Äôs on normal

[0:44:48] <+EdenOfLove> OOOOH there they go again
[0:44:51] <Lancaster_H> like, every 20 seconds maybe for me
[0:44:52] <%spuddnyk> No frame drops on auto
[0:44:52] <leith_aziz> Yeah I see them
[0:44:54] <dukenux> Have you heard the Tragedy of Dragon of Dojima?
[0:44:57] <%X2Eliah> yeee
[0:45:01] <+Deko_> LUL i love that one
[0:45:02] <AstrodropGaming> Frames got a little chunky there
[0:45:02] <+runegod20> some of the drops i'm seeing are mostly from swinging a bike into 20 guys, that happens alot
[0:45:12] <Wofoeh> "Super Gabriel sign"
[0:45:13] <%Pillagius> that wheel hurt when he wakes up
[0:45:18] <%big_laser_boss> nooo
[0:45:22] <%X2Eliah> if its on twitch, theres nothing woolie can do about it anyway
[0:45:23] <+Balkespower> ALRIGHT, KYODAIS!
[0:45:26] <%LastHazzerd> oh is woolie thinkin' that beast mode is for things other than swinging objects around?
[0:45:30] <+Deko_> oh shit this yeyeye
[0:45:31] <+Balkespower> <<IT'S TIME>>
[0:45:31] <Wofoeh> Ok... I'm curious now... what the fuck is "Super gabriel"
[0:45:32] <Mattais88> Zoom zoom zoom
[0:45:32] <brokencr0ss> Oh wait
[0:45:34] <%X2Eliah> So unless it's Minh uploading some stuff
[0:45:36] <brunoberserk> when kiryu use the bike as a weapon , the game becames a MUSOU
[0:45:36] <Karego_at> can't really use chargeups against groups...
[0:45:37] <%big_laser_boss> they don't affect hyper armour
[0:45:38] <downwiththethickness99> X,X, charge X then Y
[0:45:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> YOOOOO
[0:45:44] <+KillMyPast> ITS TIME
[0:45:45] <fIashman92> I never found much use for charge moves outside of just messing around
[0:45:47] <+Chronobot> YEYEYEYE
[0:45:47] <whiteblacklight74> @LastHazzerd it's also for swinging grabbed enemies around
[0:45:47] <@Squdnate> There was only one instance of frame drop due to enemies on screen. Whatever other "frame drops" is probably due to your own connection
[0:45:48] <OblivionSword1> YOOOOO

[1:00:14] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @WoolieVersus Going back to what Kuze said a bit: since this is a prequel, disbelief in his odds of winning were so high the devs went with a different narrative angle instead.
[1:00:20] <%Exiliator> Currrrrrry'n'sauna
[1:00:22] <%LastHazzerd> japan has space for golf?

[1:01:40] <Verfreeze> Honestly one of the worst things about playing 0 first is that everyone talks about Kazama all the time and the player hasn't even seen him

[1:02:16] <leith_aziz> Since Kazama is Kiryu's driving motivation, he should hae appeared more I agree

[1:02:51] <OokamiDen02> he is pure grease
[1:02:53] <%Deft_Thought> I feel like Kiryu's plot is a collection of interesting things happening around Kiryu. He doesn't have much of his own motivating presence until the 3rd act of 0
[1:02:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Now you're seeing the full extent of the captains. Kuze, direct and brute forces his way through things. Awano, uses anything he can to get an edge on his opponents.

[1:18:13] <notorious_rng> i believe in that cutscene they actually placed nishiki about a 1 foot above the ground to put him at the same height as kiryu

[1:18:15] <%X2Eliah> Kiryu stole Nishiki's Car AND 30million

[1:29:28] <%aram909> time for best business
[1:29:29] <DatAsuna> I forgot how super expositional this was lol
[1:29:30] <DeadlyWest> @runegod20 Basically, cabaret is a very large cabaret club
[1:29:31] <%aram909> and best music
[1:29:32] <%patriotrenegade> All I wanted was a J-pop harem...
[1:29:35] <LordOfThePoultry> money making time
[1:29:36] <CyberArtClub> Someone is dying rn
[1:29:40] <$razielhex> Da bizness
[1:29:42] <Doctadaking> Everybody got the hand signals memorized, right?
[1:29:47] <dukenux> Wonder if he's still ALIVE
[1:29:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> so
[1:29:58] <brachydios777> Not Saejima
[1:29:58] <+runegod20> so the difference between a sit down resturant and a fast food place?
[1:30:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:30:10] <DeadlyWest> as far as I know, yeah @runegod20
[1:30:10] <+Chronobot> Minigame dimension
[1:30:12] <Vashido22> yup
[1:30:12] <velgaduere> correct
[1:30:13] <%osaka_daioh> Yep
[1:30:15] <PsychoPearl> Yes
[1:30:15] <%Javaa01> Good thing those people don't exist
[1:30:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Like a FOOL
[1:30:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Correct
[1:30:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> If youre a fake fan
[1:30:18] <Vashido22> thats the point
[1:30:19] <%X2Eliah> So, Saejima vs Kuze??
[1:30:20] <fIashman92> That's what Simmons did
[1:30:23] <enerkaizer> That was OG yakuza
[1:30:23] <Doctadaking> Mostly
[1:30:24] <brachydios777> Yes
[1:30:24] <%Double_Tap_That> There's a bit of levity.
[1:30:24] <%gatorafan> like a COWARD
[1:30:27] <DatAsuna> not dead serious
[1:30:30] <velgaduere> 100% melodrama
[1:30:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> If youre a coward youd do that
[1:30:32] <DatAsuna> but yes dramatic
[1:30:32] <+velvetoctopuss> playable DORAMA
[1:30:33] <notorious_rng> theres usually at least one manual diversion
[1:30:36] <penitentpendant> Pursue the game you want
[1:30:38] <jotabranded> 12h
[1:30:40] <DeadlyWest> For the most part, yeah. Some games are fucking pure CHAOS even in the main story
[1:30:42] <AvroEltz> "what is a soapland?"
[1:30:42] <Astrophizz> you'd get interrupted by substories that trigger while walking by
[1:30:44] <+Balkespower> I spend 100h in this game
[1:30:45] <Afroperonista> not even, more like 10
[1:30:47] <@Menitta> Its not goofy like the side story. It never gets that goofy
[1:30:49] <%X2Eliah> LOOK AT ALL THOSE SIDE QUESTS
[1:30:53] <+Ancopro> most the other yakuza you could completely miss the wacky shit if you don't look for it
[1:30:54] <majindusto> ONLY COWARDS AND VILLAINS DO THAT
[1:30:58] <Darren716> Oh shit is it time for the Nick Cage quest?
[1:31:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Side quests Kreygasm
[1:31:01] <dante_suoh> If you skip cutscenes 0 is a 3 hour game
[1:31:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DO THE ONES IN THE PARK
[1:31:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DO THE PARK
[1:31:18] <+rubeSandwich> alot of these games force you into atleast 1 or 2 wacky hijinks but I think you can still ignore most of it
[1:31:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Park ones are strong
[1:31:20] <%Exiliator> Unlocking the clubs is probably an idea
[1:31:22] <$razielhex> fifteen of the eight Yakuza games are about the real estate in the Tower of Japan
[1:31:23] <penitentpendant> Lee can bleed out for these sidequests
[1:31:24] <andre11dr> Wait, IS THAT GHOST PORN I SEE?
[1:31:31] <%gatorafan> Should we save this big dude? OR LETS DO SOME SIDE QUESTS!
[1:31:32] <%Double_Tap_That> I'd rather have a deep pool than a shallow oceasn.
[1:31:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> if Woolie goes toward the park go into emote mode ASAP
[1:31:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Western games are cowards
[1:31:42] <resloxxx> The giant empty
[1:31:42] <Solidnick18> i love this just little area ya got
[1:31:43] <brokencr0ss> Without side content Kiwami is like five hours long
[1:31:45] <+runegod20> not ghost porn time, but i tihnk it's closer than it was before
[1:31:46] <penitentpendant> Chonker Biker
[1:31:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> too afraid to have fun
[1:31:47] <+Stupid121v2> Majima doesn't understand money throwing tech yet
[1:31:48] <dukenux> atleast it doesn't force you into busywork
[1:31:48] <downwiththethickness99> You dont have a quest finder. You just started up a bunch of substories
[1:31:52] <DatAsuna> north
[1:31:54] <Jp_DrZaius> NOICE
[1:31:55] <penitentpendant> Oh baby a Triple
[1:32:02] <+SuperKirby24> b o n k
[1:32:09] <+Balkespower> one clearly bled a lot of bloood
[1:32:17] <+Balkespower> are we sure he is still alive?
[1:32:19] <DeadlyWest> @brokencr0ss Kiwami and Kiwami 2 in general are really short for Yakuza games. I beat Kiwami 1 in 50 hours and Kiwami 2 in 45, counting the OTHER saga
[1:32:20] <%Exiliator> It's good value for money
[1:32:20] <winner_92> it's honestly absurd how much just STUFF there is in these games
[1:32:21] <andre11dr> Majima has such a cool moveset
[1:32:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Shenmue LUL
[1:32:25] <Tuna_Can_0> mild concussions
[1:32:26] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus I've noticed some several frame drops the last hour or so
[1:32:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Eyepatch wolf CRIES
[1:32:33] <penitentpendant> North East part of the map
[1:32:34] <+Balkespower> true
[1:32:34] <DatAsuna> This still doesn't fill the shenmue hole
[1:32:35] <Solidnick18> shenpoo more like it
[1:32:38] <%0rond> not even by shenmue LUL
[1:32:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Shenmue 3 though LUL LUL LUL
[1:32:40] <brachydios777> It‚Äôs so much better than Shenmu
[1:32:40] <@Squdnate> Wanted you to get out of the important cutscenes
[1:32:43] <+Balkespower> Why play Shenmue when you can play yakuza?
[1:32:44] <+TrevSmith222> Yeah, 0's story is super short. My second playthough I maxed both of the boys out real early and steamrolled the rest of the game.
[1:32:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Shenmue walked so Yakuza could run
[1:32:45] <@Squdnate> To notify
[1:32:46] <Mattais88> I finished 0 last week. All sidequests done, max fighting styles, 130 hours
[1:32:47] <DatAsuna> but if it did, it would be a bad game
[1:32:47] <Slim_pickings> I think the creator of Yakuza worked on Shenmue
[1:32:48] <GarbageNirvana> Problem is most western open world games are sprawling wastelands of nothing between map markers
[1:32:50] <Jp_DrZaius> A hole of Chinese imitations (?
[1:32:53] <+vaderxyz1970> Very dence open world
[1:32:53] <%Reverend_Roscoe> NORTH
[1:32:56] <Tuna_Can_0> empty world open world
[1:32:57] <+Stupid121v2> This is "open world" but its just so tightly packed
[1:33:00] <dukenux> They are, in Ubisoft's case
[1:33:00] <andre11dr> Yeah, this games where always Shenmue but good
[1:33:01] <penitentpendant> Hey look, Money
[1:33:02] <+bigb00gi3> doesn't yakuza literally like reuse kamurocho
[1:33:02] <Dabrikishaw> And then Shenmue 3 refused to learn from anyone.
[1:33:06] <%patriotrenegade> Pat is single-handedly responsible for bringing Yakuza into vogue. According to him.
[1:33:06] <Solidnick18> yo riche
[1:33:08] <+runegod20> It's open world but the map being a fraction of the size of your average open world game I think is very much to it's advantage
[1:33:09] <+BusterRepukken> Ubisofts games are boring though
[1:33:11] <%aram909> much much much prefer the yakuza open world over the ubisoft open world
[1:33:14] <strudel_h> SourPls
[1:33:15] <DeadlyWest> @TrevSmith222 Same. I beat Kuze's ass in the second fight with max Kiryu, it was funny
[1:33:16] <syanplague> i played Far cry 3 i don¬¥t think i need to play anymore
[1:33:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @dabrikishaw even from itself
[1:33:16] <penitentpendant> Time to warm up on a walking wallet
[1:33:16] <%Juriasu> you're rich? I'LL KILL YOU
[1:33:17] <EX_shuffle> Ubisoft's games all blend together for me
[1:33:20] <%NotEnoughGun> Wow, that's kinda fucked. This business owner is operaating under the assumption that Majima has kidnapped and is doing awful things to some girl. And is fine with it simply saying "this is juicy, and you owe me one" what THE HELL lol @Woolieversus
[1:33:20] <%aram909> western open world games have so little interactivity
[1:33:22] <%doomerskeletor13> These games reuse a SHIT TON of assets from game to game
[1:33:22] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus Trying again. There are some frame drops on stream
[1:33:23] <syanplague> any other game
[1:33:28] <%gatorafan> MAJIMA MUSIC IS SO COOL
[1:33:28] <dukenux> Nomorich now
[1:33:29] <%aram909> its why breath of the wild owns because theres so much experimentation and interactivity to do
[1:33:29] <syanplague> like that
[1:33:29] <Astrophizz> I like both open world styles, just different flavors and moods
[1:33:31] <@akuda_bar> @Squdnate woolieONEGUY
[1:33:42] <downwiththethickness99> 51 CP holy shit
[1:33:43] <@Squdnate> No, I have noticed several of them myself
[1:33:46] <DatAsuna> I think people overstate the shenmue comparison though, yakuza necessarily lacks a lot of the things that define shenmue
[1:33:47] <%aram909> yet its still a big open world but its also dense as in theres so much to find and interact with
[1:33:50] <GarbageNirvana> Also Ubisoft games are literally just paint by numbers now
[1:33:52] <%aram909> best of both types of open worlds
[1:33:52] <@Squdnate> And I have gucci connection
[1:33:58] <%patriotrenegade> I‚Äôve been getting drops too
[1:33:59] <dukenux> Tony Hawk's Underground almost unlocked PogChamp
[1:34:01] <%TheSpartan183> TheSpartan183 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[1:34:01] <+runegod20> overall this is a pretty damn good amount of upgrades you've gotten
[1:34:02] <DeadlyWest> @bigb00gi3 There's other cities in most of the games, but as far as I know all Yakuza games have Kamarucho in them
[1:34:02] <DatAsuna> And that's not a complaint, if it were more like shenmue it'd suck
[1:34:06] <%doomerskeletor13> RDR2 has a ridiculous amount of content density despite having such a large map
[1:34:08] <%X2Eliah> @Squdnate What do you expect Woolie to do? call up Twitch-911?
[1:34:11] <+BusterRepukken> damn almost like the problem wasnt my connection
[1:34:13] <+TrevSmith222> @DeadlyWest Absolutely. It's kinda depressing. lol
[1:34:13] <%aram909> @DatAsuna yakuza's better than shenmue anyways
[1:34:15] <Mattais88> A western open world can be fun if it had enough variation in landscapes and a fun traveling mechanic.
[1:34:21] <@Squdnate> It's not on Twitch's part
[1:34:38] <DatAsuna> @DatAsuna I literally tried to give a disclaimer 3 times to avoid such a pedantic reply lol
[1:34:38] <EX_shuffle> I really wish it wasn't called CP
[1:34:39] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[1:34:44] <%Halospaz117> THE BEST BUSINESS
[1:34:51] <+bigb00gi3> @DeadlyWest I was pretty sure that was the case, so I feel like there's a bit of irony in saying that yakuza doesn't feel like all the games are the same
[1:34:53] <$dudedude55555> BEST
[1:34:54] <+Stupid121v2> oh god Shenmue is getting that anime
[1:34:55] <%NotEnoughGun> Also, FUCK officer stop n search forever. He should commit sepuku
[1:34:55] <chainsaw105> the BEST business V! You're WRONG!
[1:34:57] <penitentpendant> The cringe will COME
[1:34:59] <Solidnick18> got ya V
[1:35:06] <%Exiliator> Build your entire club of short haired women
[1:35:11] <%aram909> little v this is the first thing you're wrong about. cabaret club is best business
[1:35:13] <+vaderxyz1970> RYMES with cabinet
[1:35:15] <+Balkespower> hmmm
[1:35:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I‚Äôm curious how Woolie will react to it
[1:35:17] <+R0kushi> the best part of yakuza
[1:35:18] <+ItsTowersss> Kreygasm
[1:35:19] <winner_92> cabaret club is so fun
[1:35:20] <+runegod20> the map is small enough that you can travel around on foot and not take too long to get somewhere, where most open world games, even with a super fast car, takes a long time to move around
[1:35:22] <Doctadaking> V do
[1:35:23] <+Balkespower> more active
[1:35:24] <Solidnick18> wonder if shakedown is around
[1:35:30] <digitalslime> the club game here is so much better then in 3&4
[1:35:32] <+Stupid121v2> the cabaret club was super addicting
[1:35:35] <%X2Eliah> Majima fighting 3 majimas
[1:35:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Cabaret minigame is good tho
[1:35:38] <DatAsuna> First V liked swoop mor ethan pazaak, now he likes real estate more than cabaret
[1:35:40] <+Balkespower> I run into Mr. Shakedown a lot as Majima
[1:35:41] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[1:35:41] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[1:35:43] <dante_suoh> It's weird that you can steam-roll the business minigames by throwing money at them
[1:35:44] <+MajorCrasher> Woolie forgot how to do combo finishers again
[1:35:46] <CharlieDJohnson> imagine not liking the minigame that features ai uehara and engrish songs
[1:35:52] <+Balkespower> maybe because the Sotonbori is not that big
[1:35:54] <NorthGrizzly> Cabaret Club minigame is good
[1:35:55] <%Lion_kun> Yakuza lacks a lot of things that define Shenmue. Like contempt for its player's time.
[1:35:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YEEE HA
[1:35:58] <%cache_22> I enjoyed the Cabaret Club minigame more than the business stuff.
[1:36:01] <velgaduere> WACKY WAHOO YAKUZA MAN
[1:36:02] <Solidnick18> YEE HAAaaaa
[1:36:05] <Astrophizz> the dating/lecturing stuff is not great in any of the games
[1:36:05] <andre11dr> Man ,i don't get Shenmue at all
[1:36:07] <+Tucker0603> 'insert trump WRONG meme here' in relation to V's opinion
[1:36:07] <CastellanVon> What's your favorite heat move chat? I love Majima's backflip off the wall to kick a dude.
[1:36:14] <+runegod20> ooo, it's that quest
[1:36:14] <Solidnick18> he's just loving it
[1:36:17] <turbofolk> I would've thought Woolie would start bitching more about awano shooting that woman for nothing, oh well
[1:36:20] <%NotEnoughGun> Cabaret club was introduced in Ps2 yakuza 2. IT WAS FUN THEN AND ITS FUN NOW
[1:36:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:36:24] <%notsoy> breaker's teacher lessons give some great stuff
[1:36:30] <DatAsuna> Yakuza lacks shenmue's dedication to pedantry and anti-story
[1:36:35] <DeadlyWest> @bigb00gi3 While they use the same environments, a lot of the games play quite differently to each other. You can separate the different eras based on that. Yakuza 1-5 is a bit more limited but easier to upgrade, 0/Kiwami is very similar but has styles and Kiwami 2/6 plays pretty differently
[1:36:37] <penitentpendant> Had our does of melodrama, time for some GOOFY
[1:36:38] <DatAsuna> Shenmue is all plot, no narrative
[1:36:39] <majindusto> Cabaret is THE BEST in 0/Kiwami2
[1:36:40] <%HeroToxiko> @Lion_kun and bad qte's and a story that refuses to be resolved out of spite
[1:36:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah some of the Breaker moves you learn from the master are so fucking cool
[1:36:55] <NorthGrizzly> Woolie do this
[1:37:00] <penitentpendant> Repair?
[1:37:02] <SherlockianHero> Lee is probably fine rn.
[1:37:04] <nervyharbor> @castellanvon essense of 88' kiryu
[1:37:05] <Solidnick18> maybe till the thing
[1:37:10] <downwiththethickness99> No shes the shop . He's the trainer
[1:37:21] <+runegod20> can you find better brass knuckles than the default ones? Since sounds sounds like it'd be really useful
[1:37:22] <brachydios777> I completely ignored the weapons shop
[1:37:27] <%NotEnoughGun> My favorite majima move is "EAT THE BAT"
[1:37:31] <andre11dr> I feel like when people praise Shenmue it's more for it's innovation than it's quality, i think those games age like trash and they are boring
[1:37:33] <RyuuAoi> Need a Shakedown
[1:37:38] <%doomerskeletor13> This lets plays is making me want to replay Zero but I‚Äôm still trying to platinum 7
[1:37:40] <Darren716> Yeah I'm shocked Woolie is using the weapons so much
[1:37:47] <turbofolk> @brachydios777 I used to farm slimeguns to farm shakedowns
[1:37:49] <%notsoy> zap guns are probably the most useful thing you could search for if you didn't have any luck buying one
[1:37:49] <winner_92> i never got much mileage out of the weapon shops they're super fiddly for how little they really add imo
[1:37:50] <DeadlyWest> @CastellanVon The light pole one in Kiwami 2. Just so brutal
[1:37:50] <Afroperonista> Bomb Rush Cyberfunk official trailer PogChamp
[1:37:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> You did just buy t though
[1:38:03] <+runegod20> "I should save money" *also buys every weapons in the shop without thinking*
[1:38:08] <brachydios777> I like fists more than weapons

[1:38:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Afroperonista yo can you whisper me the link?
[1:38:21] <DeadlyWest> I barely used weapons outside of slugger, honestly
[1:38:28] <brachydios777> Normal
[1:38:31] <Mattais88> The spear style is really fun
[1:38:36] <Fraud_Howard> I used the equipment search to find the extremely sturdy brass knuckles for Kiryu's rush style
[1:38:44] <whiteblacklight74> weapon*
[1:38:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I‚Äôm sad we won‚Äôt get to hear the funky Kung Fu song with this training anymore

[1:46:45] <%X2Eliah> It's the GPU of whiskies
[1:46:46] <Darren716> Bannnnnd
[1:46:46] <%RyTYoung> GLENFIDDICH MY BOY
[1:46:48] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Also, only game so far I know has Drunken Fist Essence is Judge Eyes.
[1:46:49] <Darren716> *brand
[1:46:49] <%gatorafan> Look at this AD
[1:46:50] <%osaka_daioh> oh we are doing this.

[1:46:52] <RyuuAoi> That's a classic
[1:46:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> EDGE
[1:46:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh yeah they are all ads lmao
[1:46:54] <$dudedude55555> delicious ad
[1:46:57] <+Awkward_Cyborg> Lore of the booze!
[1:46:58] <$thomassolorio> hibiki is sold by santory
[1:47:00] <Doctadaking> Hope you remember this
[1:47:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BRAND SHOT
[1:47:03] <OokamiDen02> and also a good Kamen Rider
[1:47:04] <AngryAsian5> EDGE
[1:47:05] <%LionheartedRebel> they did sooooooo much product placement for the booze
[1:47:05] <Zebroneath> Let me explain!
[1:47:07] <%NotEnoughGun> The localization team are the REAL heroes of Yakuza
[1:47:08] <+chiazam> Yakuza got me into Alcohol
[1:47:09] <%Juriasu> Yakuza: Full Body
[1:47:09] <+Ancopro> and that's you tip for the day
[1:47:10] <@Menitta> I need to get some japanese whiskey
[1:47:13] <skyentombment> There's a restaurant here in Mexico called Suntory, and it's the fanciest japanese you can get this side of the pond
[1:47:14] <OblivionSword1> product placement drink
[1:47:18] <downwiththethickness99> Tbf Catherine is a Sega property too
[1:47:18] <%Kaito_Cam> I mean catherine is from sega technically
[1:47:18] <$thomassolorio> and yamasaki was voted best whiskey in the world last year
[1:47:28] <Solidnick18> gotta love your drinks and know em.
[1:47:30] <%0rond> how 'bout some trivia, as you seemed to have finished your drink
[1:47:35] <@Menitta> I had this fuckin Kentucky Whiskey that was blended by japanese whiskey makers
[1:47:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[1:47:38] <@Menitta> It was sooooo good
[1:47:41] <%X2Eliah> So be careful with Japanese Whiskies, they have almost no legal protection for booze being allowed to be called "whiskey"
[1:47:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> canon he tells trivia while you drink LUL
[1:47:46] <%DashXero> I love liquor trivia!
[1:47:52] <penitentpendant> "Buy everything on the list."
[1:47:59] <@Squdnate> I have personally never been that much of a fan of Japanese whiskey. They taste too sweet. I'm more a Scottish kind of guy
[1:48:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Majima have you heard of Lootcrate?
[1:48:13] <turbofolk> OBLIGATORY AD-FOCUSED SIDE STORY
[1:48:15] <skyentombment> I like that Majima is being humble here, despite owning a giant club and knowing a shitton about booze
[1:48:17] <RyuuAoi> Karkov
[1:48:17] <+Balkespower> SPEEDRUN ALCOHOLISM
[1:48:19] <%NotEnoughGun> Lol beefeater "fine liquor
[1:48:21] <%Asuterisuku> This is how the bar works in every game, by the way.
[1:48:25] <penitentpendant> Karen HAS RETURNED
[1:48:25] <+runegod20> I haven't really drank any booze in my life, the stuff taste like poison to me which is pretty fitting
[1:48:29] <Mattais88> I have a vanilla whiskey that's delicious
[1:48:30] <%X2Eliah> Mix a nice sweet japanese whiskey with smth like bunnahabhain 12
[1:48:35] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> In all games it increases the rate you build up heat.
[1:48:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PART 2

[1:48:59] <+0neReeler> *teleports in front*

[2:29:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Wow I‚Äôve never seen a bug like that and I‚Äôve played this game a lot
[2:30:00] <Jashter18> The QA never stops with WoolieVS
[2:30:01] <PortableBoredom> @ScottishMadJacko The PC version, clearly the inferior version which adds bugs
[2:30:01] <majindusto> CHECK ITEMS
[2:30:01] <strudel_h> save and reload?
[2:30:02] <+runegod20> the save glitch was way after we did this quest
[2:30:02] <%cache_22> The world is falling apart before our very eyes.
[2:30:03] <fIashman92> New save
[2:30:03] <%Exiliator> new save
[2:30:03] <beatie_g> hard drive is failing NotLikeThis
[2:30:03] <%r0chelimit> Ive never even heard of this happening
[2:30:05] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> ITEMS FUCKED!
[2:30:05] <linSP> are items food
[2:30:07] <+Tucker0603> GAME AT FIRST
[2:30:08] <+Balkespower> I never seen that glitch
[2:30:09] <skyentombment> Man , how is the game breaking like this?
[2:30:10] <xbb1024> create new
[2:30:11] <twoto858> Check the items!
[2:30:14] <RyuuAoi> Game breaking
[2:30:17] <+SuperKirby24> that's pretty weird
[2:30:18] <+rrratbastard> the obatarian rules over life and reality's very seams
[2:30:19] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie needs a 2nd stand for his QA Powers
[2:30:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Woolie's stand is too powerful
[2:30:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie's QA Stand is something else
[2:30:22] <brokencr0ss> You definitely loaded the wrong save at some point
[2:30:22] <Louie_Salmon> Oh it was probably lost in the safe shenanigans from before
[2:30:24] <kirbloid> Never escape QA testing ever
[2:30:24] <Darren716> What item did he get from taxes?
[2:30:27] <jorniev> the tax paradox is crazy man
[2:30:30] <RyuuAoi> Woolie used to get paid to break games
[2:30:31] <andre11dr> Wow Woolie is finding all the bugs ive never seen, that QA curse is stronk
[2:30:41] <$dudedude55555> yakuza keeps you on your toes
[2:30:42] <therealtacopancakes> control your stando woolie
[2:30:43] <majindusto> THIS IS WHY YOU PLAY ON PS4
[2:30:45] <%cache_22> Woolie needs to exorcise those PC demons.
[2:30:46] <+Ancopro> did you save?
[2:30:51] <+Awkward_Cyborg> maybe you didn't save after completing that quest?
[2:30:54] <%krispen_wa> SLAVE SLOT
[2:30:55] <DeadlyWest> Yeah, load a previous save you should be fine
[2:30:57] <OblivionSword1> slave slot
[2:30:58] <Haarute> load up a kiryu save and check if it's done there, you might not have saved it done.
[2:30:59] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> This is why you play on PS4 indeed.
[2:31:01] <+Tucker0603> @woolieversus your QA powers are amazing
[2:31:03] <penitentpendant> You'll have to mash through some dialogue
[2:31:04] <skyentombment> QA! QA! QA! That's a C bug!
[2:31:21] <CyberArtClub> We need to find the source of the paradox
[2:31:24] <Darren716> That's a solid B I think
[2:31:29] <JetpackMcQuack> this is fine
[2:31:30] <Doctadaking> I thought there were too many substories on the map
[2:31:36] <CharlieDJohnson> rb + A
[2:31:38] <majindusto> I think woolie fucked up saving after a substory
[2:31:40] <%doomerskeletor13> I‚Äôve never had so many bugs in this game
[2:31:47] <+Tucker0603> RB+A
[2:31:49] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> R1 + X = Fast Text
[2:31:50] <+Ancopro> i thik holding R1 fast forwards
[2:31:51] <downwiththethickness99> You probably loaded the wrong save earlier in the game @WoolieVersus
[2:31:51] <aurasviel> The Obatarian has resurrected
[2:31:52] <DSD24> Blue Suit
[2:31:52] <PortableBoredom> PC exclusive "features" Kappa
[2:31:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> RB + A ?
[2:31:56] <Karego_at> i've had 0 bugs on ps4
[2:31:56] <+MajorCrasher> I think woolie just loaded the wrong save at some point
[2:32:00] <+runegod20> i was trying to figure out what side story was in that corner since I know that's where the tax is and couldn't figure out what else would have been there
[2:32:01] <Timarkot> Fresh sets of eyes
[2:32:02] <JetpackMcQuack> Shakedown overflow error
[2:32:02] <dante_suoh> double golden gun?
[2:32:05] <DeadlyWest> @majindusto That wouldn't have done anything to general game progress. Just the save that fucked up stuff
[2:32:07] <+SuperKirby24> the obatarian undid taxes LUL
[2:32:07] <majindusto> PS4 HAD NONE OF THESE ISSUES
[2:32:10] <skyentombment> let's just get the rewards for taxes again!
[2:32:10] <%solracc25> Tax Requiem
[2:32:16] <Jashter18> This must be a feature of Bring Me To Life
[2:32:16] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Yeah, play on PS4 man
[2:32:20] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> save yourself the hassle.
[2:32:20] <DeadlyWest> I didn't have these issues on XB1 either
[2:32:21] <Dante_Namikaze1> oof the PC port is bugged as fuck, I guess if you do end up playing the other games maybe play the PlayStation versions
[2:32:23] <RyuuAoi> What if you need to complete that to beat game? Bad bug
[2:32:24] <+wanderingcanuck> I've only had the item transformation bug on PC. But i always save religiously for PC games.
[2:32:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Real useful when you‚Äôre doing replays
[2:32:28] <+Awkward_Cyborg> I have over 200 hours on this game on PC and I never encountered any of these bugs
[2:32:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:32:31] <penitentpendant> Gone
[2:32:37] <DeadlyWest> nope it's not there
[2:32:39] <+Jiggisnipe> wow
[2:32:40] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus So I can be ultra fast, you can hold R1 and X
[2:32:40] <velgaduere> what the fuck
[2:32:40] <DeadlyWest> it was at the top
[2:32:41] <+Ancopro> weeeeeeeird
[2:32:42] <skyentombment> WHAT
[2:32:42] <+bearwagon> yo wtf
[2:32:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> @dante_namikaze1 worked for me TradeMark
[2:32:43] <+Tucker0603> NOPE NOT THERE
[2:32:44] <PsychoPearl> wow
[2:32:45] <LordOfThePoultry> uhhhh
[2:32:45] <Equirah> @Sonny_FIRESTORM you seem like a totally reliable and unbiased source
[2:32:47] <$dudedude55555> TIMELINE CHANGED
[2:32:48] <ManlyMcBeefington> load Kiryu save?
[2:32:49] <%Josef_Stryker> I guess just do that offscreen
[2:32:50] <%Asuterisuku> You can. skip those too
[2:32:52] <+nevermorecake> Hrmmm I never had a single bug when playing on PC I wonder what the difference is
[2:32:52] <ghoststalker> RIP
[2:32:52] <+Tucker0603> KING CRIMSON
[2:32:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Reality rewrote it
[2:32:53] <Haarute> @WoolieVersus you might have NOT saved that progress back then
[2:32:53] <Karego_at> i've seen other streamers have these bigs on pc too
[2:32:54] <%notsoy> redo it offscreen?
[2:32:55] <BabblingBayou> that's....new
[2:32:55] <RyuuAoi> Gone
[2:32:55] <andre11dr> UNMADE
[2:32:56] <halfmasks> GASLIGHTING
[2:32:57] <%krispen_wa> KORE GA... REQUIEM DA
[2:32:58] <skyentombment> THE WORLD REFUSED TO CHANGE
[2:32:59] <OkamiDude15> KILLER QUEEN
[2:32:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> JAPANESE ECONOMY IS SAVED
[2:33:00] <Karego_at> seems like a pc issue
[2:33:01] <jotabranded> redo offscreen
[2:33:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LEY LINES SHIFTED
[2:33:02] <Jp_DrZaius> wasnt it with Kiryu??
[2:33:05] <RyuuAoi> BROKEN
[2:33:08] <penitentpendant> Za Warudo
[2:33:09] <downwiththethickness99> Try loading an old Kiryu save
[2:33:11] <DeadlyWest> go back to Slot 1?
[2:33:12] <%solracc25> The sidestory got TAXED!
[2:33:13] <+runegod20> we picked all the right option except the final one
[2:33:14] <+Ancopro> is this woolies stand
[2:33:15] <skyentombment> THE LEAGUE OF DARKNESS
[2:33:21] <halfmasks> @Jp_DrZaius Nope definitely a majima sidestory
[2:33:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Rewind to the beginning of the game just to be sure
[2:33:28] <DedlokPM> @Jp_DrZaius The taxes one? No. That was Majima
[2:33:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Kappa
[2:33:30] <RyuuAoi> DO OT
[2:33:31] <%cache_22> So who is going to replay this game on PS4 to save this LP?
[2:33:33] <CharlieDJohnson> these bugs are most likely to happen from everything ive heard if you mash through the save prompt too fast
[2:33:34] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> @Equirah If I was the only person saying it, you might've had a point.
[2:33:35] <CharlieDJohnson> just linger
[2:33:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @skyentombment the League of Darkness? The League of Darkness.
[2:33:38] <penitentpendant> Still Gone, DELETED FROM THE TIMELINE
[2:33:40] <PsychoPearl> Weird
[2:33:43] <Qu1ckyyy> What is going on? Ah, my head,
[2:33:43] <%notsoy> aaaaaand it's gone, it's all gone
[2:33:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Retconned from existence
[2:33:45] <RyuuAoi> Bug Bois
[2:33:50] <andre11dr> That's weird
[2:33:51] <aurasviel> Obatarian has returned on the map
[2:33:51] <Jp_DrZaius> @dedlokpm huh.. weird
[2:33:51] <%osaka_daioh> choose all the wrong answers this time
[2:33:53] <+Awkward_Cyborg> I think you didn't save after completing that sidequest the first time you did it
[2:33:54] <velgaduere> okay, now I'm starting to see frames drop
[2:33:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Gone. reduced to atoms
[2:33:54] <Louie_Salmon> Was it because of the other save bug?
[2:33:55] <Pnutz409> 2nd loop
[2:33:55] <%Exiliator> Answer differently this time
[2:33:56] <+Tucker0603> did you have to reload before you saved doing that?
[2:33:57] <brunoberserk> SCARY
[2:33:59] <%solracc25> Tax tax tax tax the quest
[2:34:00] <ghoststalker> bug bois
[2:34:03] <skyentombment> @Th3SmartAlec The The The The The League of Darkness
[2:34:05] <Equirah> time to pick up different answers LUL
[2:34:10] <%doomerskeletor13> It looked like most of the ones you did were still there
[2:34:15] <RyuuAoi> Bug it and lunch?
[2:34:15] <andre11dr> Did you not save after doing it?
[2:34:30] <+Tucker0603> that's still good
[2:34:32] <dante_suoh> Bet him and you get good gun money
[2:34:33] <Haarute> you probably just reloaded a wrong save because you were confused about how the listed time worked
[2:34:33] <%Asuterisuku> 50% sales tax say what?
[2:34:36] <downwiththethickness99> I dont think you loaded the right save. It likely wasnt a bug
[2:34:39] <+wanderingcanuck> The game can also fail to save at times. I've had it happen once.
[2:34:40] <penitentpendant> Good opener
[2:34:41] <aurasviel> 93? Pathetic, eradicate him
[2:35:17] <%Exiliator> Tax air!
[2:35:41] <CharlieDJohnson> or pick different answers this time for new content
[2:35:48] <DSD24> Majima is stuck in a time loop
[2:35:57] <xbb1024> Maybe you lost the item?
[2:35:59] <penitentpendant> Ground Hog Day: Starring Majima
[2:36:01] <DaRealLuderlappen> Big time saving tip! Business is locked behind story progression
[2:36:01] <+SuperKirby24> b o n k
[2:36:03] <dukenux> why can you do this quedt again?
[2:36:05] <majindusto> Did you tho?
[2:36:08] <Qu1ckyyy> Majima WHERE is the key?
[2:36:10] <%wibbwobbler> lol
[2:36:16] <ghoststalker> @dukenux bug
[2:36:21] <%LionheartedRebel> weird... alright, y'all, I'm out, got my interview in 10, gotta get set up!
[2:36:22] <+runegod20> i think it was wood since we technically didn't get everything right
[2:36:23] <andre11dr> Well, i guess that guy had to die
[2:36:30] <+Ancopro> if its not a bug then it could have a been a wrong save load way back
[2:36:33] <+runegod20> I remember it being cigs, gas, and 7% tax rate
[2:36:38] <CharlieDJohnson> the rb trick works on ALL yakuzas
[2:36:40] <CyberArtClub> @LionheartedRebel Good luck!
[2:36:44] <Doctadaking> Tobacco
[2:36:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Live. Tax. Repeat.
[2:36:49] <choopercabra> Wait, didn't he do thin one already?
[2:36:53] <Doctadaking> Gasoline
[2:36:55] <%psidefx> 3
[2:37:00] <%Javaa01> Gotta tax that air
[2:37:03] <Doctadaking> 8
[2:37:06] <+runegod20> we got the tax % wrong but it's supppose to be 7 i'm sure
[2:37:06] <%phd_in_thuggery> Cheer650 I remember last time V mentioned the Shenmue connection and I always considered it this way: Shenmue is Kunio-Kun meets a point and click adventure game, Yakuza/RGG is Kunio-Kun meets a traditional JRPG system.
[2:37:10] <downwiththethickness99> Is it a bug or are they just derping. They reloaded to before that one bug
[2:37:11] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus start to backing up your saves just for precaution
[2:37:11] <%psidefx> 8
[2:37:15] <andre11dr> Again, maybe Woolie just never saved after doing it at the end of a session
[2:37:18] <RyuuAoi> Oh hell yeah we did this a looong time ago
[2:37:18] <velgaduere> Yakuza 0 100% speedrun
[2:37:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> SPIRIT STINE PogChamp
[2:37:36] <+runegod20> close enough to 10% without going over, clever
[2:37:39] <Karego_at> this isn't komiyan
[2:37:40] <majindusto> I still think woolie accidentally fucked up a save somehow cause I've never seen this happen
[2:37:42] <Crowmanhunter> There are multiple of this quest. Relax guys
[2:37:44] <Karego_at> wrong restaurant
[2:37:56] <Darren716> Wait is it night now?
[2:37:59] <Karego_at> oh wait yes it is im dumb
[2:38:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Now save LUL
[2:38:05] <Darren716> Oh nvm
[2:38:06] <Karego_at> i forgot they moved there
[2:38:07] <$dudedude55555> next week it will be gone
[2:38:13] <dukenux> does this bug happen often?
[2:38:14] <RyuuAoi> Save
[2:38:19] <+runegod20> i'm pretty sure that's a crafting item and not a piece of gear? feels like it
[2:38:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> The juice is stored in the bag
[2:38:28] <+runegod20> dog or other wise
[2:38:31] <NeroInfinite> It's a rare bug
[2:38:42] <lbrownthedestroyer> Capri Sun is 0% juice
[2:38:47] <penitentpendant> A mere 1 million
[2:38:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> And one candy
[2:38:50] <%Exiliator> or even worse... bagged milk! Ew! Kappa
[2:38:51] <$dudedude55555> business!
[2:38:52] <asdief_> Canada normalizing liquids in bags
[2:38:52] <dukenux> makes more sense than bagged milk Kappa
[2:38:55] <+runegod20> i think some of the 'quests' on the map are the move trainers which we ignored as majima
[2:38:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's actually just a wrong save file loaded, I just checked the stream wheere you did the tax quest, you saved right before doing it and again right after bc the stream ended, the next stream you started from where you saved before the quest
[2:38:56] <+noajenkk> what was the bug? just arrived.
[2:39:01] <Who_lio42> Canada milk is bag juice basically
[2:39:01] <DaRealLuderlappen> Big time saving tip! Business is locked behind story progression
[2:39:02] <Darren716> Business IS plot related
[2:39:04] <downwiththethickness99> You need to do story to get the business.
[2:39:05] <penitentpendant> It's part of Plot
[2:39:08] <+runegod20> you 100% have to progress plot
[2:39:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:39:09] <%Javaa01> The business is a part of the plot just like it is with Kiryu
[2:39:09] <DaRealLuderlappen> Plot

[2:48:33] <+noajenkk> it costs 0 dollars to not talk about other games
[2:48:35] <ghoststalker> @eljuanito1989 V literally told people to shut up about him when he showed up
[2:48:35] <penitentpendant> I forget if the fifth requires another one done first
[2:48:36] <Doctadaking> Yakuza 0 and Judgment have my favorite OSTs in the series

[2:50:02] <shiroyaa_> @eljuanito1989 also, he's only in the cover of Kiwami 2, not the original ps2 game.
[2:50:05] <DeadlyWest> @eljuanito1989 Doesn't matter, at all. Yakuza in the West has only gotten popular in the last half a decade and we only got a version of Yakuza 2 in the West like 2 years ago
[2:50:06] <CyberArtClub> Didn't know we were following the "statute of limitations" bs in here LUL
[2:50:16] <velgaduere> AYOOOOO
[2:50:16] <%krispen_wa> AY YOOO
[2:50:16] <+Balkespower> so we use knifes for TRAINING
[2:50:17] <+runegod20> i'm pretty sure you don't have to do breaker battles, but I'm pretty sure he gets more dialogue the more you do them
[2:50:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> Red guy finally LUL
[2:50:21] <ShepardUA> so, did someone mention a possible mass effect movie leak? ü§î
[2:50:22] <penitentpendant> At least it's not Blue this time
[2:50:22] <dukenux> D:
[2:50:23] <DeadlyWest> "statute of limitations" does not apply here, at all.
[2:50:33] <+SuperKirby24> red guy finally gets his comeuppance LUL
[2:50:35] <+runegod20> hasn't there been tlak of a mass effect movie for decade?
[2:50:38] <Darren716> HOLY SHIT GME
[2:50:38] <dante_suoh> Hold left trigger to prevent heat moves
[2:50:40] <ghoststalker> @deadlywest not true, the original PS2 game was out in the US a decade ago
[2:50:43] <Darren716> It's going back to the moon!
[2:50:53] <Doctadaking> Why did they have knives
[2:50:58] <%big_laser_boss> You can hold a button to suppress heat moves. Don't remember which one
[2:51:07] <Solidnick18> rolling snake PogChamp
[2:51:11] <DeadlyWest> @ghoststalker Really? Huh. For some reason I thought Yakuza 2 didn't come out in the West. Fair enough then
[2:51:12] <CureMode_> hold left trigger and you wont activate heat moves
[2:51:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Doctadaking training Kappa
[2:51:17] <andre11dr> Wow ,Majimas face looks so evil in combat LUL
[2:51:20] <+runegod20> one of the bumpers/triggers I think stop heat moves from going off
[2:51:38] <+runegod20> this one looks cool but is too specific
[2:51:39] <+BusterRepukken> ok, time out eljuanito
[2:51:41] <+BusterRepukken> for real
[2:51:43] <penitentpendant> This is a weirdly contextual one

[3:05:10] <Equirah> Chat, sgut up!
[3:05:16] <brachydios777> I will never figure out mahjong
[3:05:22] <ghoststalker> @dukenux that‚Äôs not even mahjong lol. There‚Äôs a similar game in real life, but most people won‚Äôt call it proper mahjong
[3:05:27] <winner_92> me and the boys playing mahjong while i recover from several gunshot wounds
[3:05:29] <penitentpendant> "Yeah, sure buddy."
[3:05:32] <LordOfThePoultry> Kappa
[3:05:40] <CharlieDJohnson> @Darren716 about 6 hours for me, fuck that mahjongg girl, her chipper attitude didnt help
[3:05:41] <dukenux> are there difference rules to chinese and japanese mahjong
[3:05:42] <downwiththethickness99> You wont kill her, pussy
[3:05:47] <ghoststalker> I‚Äôm literally sitting in front of an unopened mahjong set underneath my desk right now lol
[3:05:53] <ghoststalker> @dukenux yes, scoring wise
[3:05:56] <penitentpendant> TBF, they were willing to use GUN to acquire her
[3:05:58] <dukenux> @ghoststalker all i know is that it uses mahjong tiles
[3:06:01] <ghoststalker> Also some of the tiles used
[3:06:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[3:06:04] <$Nettacki> My dad used to play mahjong when I was a kid
[3:06:06] <Darren716> CharlieDJohnson Didn't help that I didn't know how to even set up reach, or that there was a button for it
[3:06:10] <$Nettacki> He never taught me tho

[3:06:42] <winner_92> isnt that sword literally named "Chinese Broadsword" in game LUL
[3:06:42] <ghoststalker> Japanese mahjong doesn‚Äôt like chicken hands (winning hands with no multipliers) and doesn‚Äôt use Flower tiles as scoring multipliers
[3:06:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> So, its treason then
[3:06:48] <+runegod20> I mean, there is a chinese weapon smith 3 minutes away from this place, not too hard to get one

[3:10:15] <%X2Eliah> Serious Crime Drama
[3:10:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I think it‚Äôs a real but rare thing
[3:10:17] <LordOfThePoultry> its real
[3:10:24] <penitentpendant> The most heroic of Massive Men
[3:10:24] <PsychoPearl> It's a real thing
[3:10:26] <+Tucker0603> a real kick in the dick indeed
[3:10:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the brain does weird things
[3:10:31] <dukenux> Hank Hill suffered from it, so its real
[3:10:31] <+runegod20> it very much sounds like a convention of fiction, but i'd believe it
[3:10:32] <ManlyMcBeefington> I think of Code Geass Nunnaly
[3:10:41] <DeadlyWest> yeah, the human brain is equally the most amazingly complex and yet stupid thing ever
[3:10:41] <velgaduere> human brains are capable of doing some weird-ass shit y'all
[3:10:41] <+cloudman_exe> This game seems to have some real beef with literally EVERY OTHER ASIAN IN THE WORLD.
[3:10:46] <%doomerskeletor13> The brain is fucking weird
[3:10:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> @cloudman_exe Welcome to Asia
[3:11:11] <%doomerskeletor13> @cloudman_exe It‚Äôs the baked in racism. Though to be fair the later games are better about it
[3:11:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> Asian racism is the most intense
[3:11:18] <andre11dr> @cloudman_exe You should see Yakuza 2
[3:11:19] <OldManDeckardCain> was it pat who was like "this doesn't make sense" because he didn't pay attention LUL
[3:11:20] <OokamiDen02> It's funny that what they say is way blander than the subtitles
[3:11:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doomerskeletor13 uhhhhhhhh
[3:11:25] <ghoststalker> @cloudman_exe it‚Äôs about the Japanese underworld, of course it will. Clashing ethnic gangs and the like always proliferate in red light areas
[3:11:30] <$tallik44123> that is just Asia
[3:11:35] <velgaduere> @OokamiDen02 the localization team is magical
[3:11:44] <penitentpendant> @doomerskeletor13 In some games they're kinda worse
[3:11:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> damn those shadowss
[3:11:51] <OokamiDen02> he just says that he wants to kill the guy, there is nothing with braking necks
[3:11:58] <OokamiDen02> @velgaduere forsure
[3:11:58] <Darren716> Like in 6 it's pretty bad
[3:12:01] <OblivionSword1> oh yeah racism against the Chinese is a HUGE DEAL in most Asian country
[3:12:03] <+cloudman_exe> @andre11dr Oh I've played Kiwami 2. And that was a trip.
[3:12:06] <winner_92> Equivalent Exchange??????
[3:12:06] <dante_suoh> Japan, Korea, and China all hate each other. Especially after WW2
[3:12:10] <%cache_22> Aren't the Chinese men still laying on the floor hearing all of this?
[3:12:23] <%doomerskeletor13> @th3smartalec I‚Äôm talking about 7 really but I don‚Äôt want to get into specifics for obvious reasons
[3:12:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> @doomerskeletor13 ah
[3:12:32] <%krispen_wa> Most of Asia hates some other country in Asia
[3:12:37] <%gatorafan> This seems to be a theme on Majima
[3:12:42] <%krispen_wa> but mostly China right now because of their expansi9n
[3:12:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie he can see his heart
[3:12:57] <andre11dr> 2 is actually like " that guy is secretly a evil Korean"
[3:13:06] <velgaduere> they fought. he learned everything about him
[3:13:07] <penitentpendant> Acupuncturist Spot Checks are amazing for Alignment, apparently
[3:13:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well yeah, Majima has had plenty chance to kill both of them
[3:13:14] <user_naim> FotNS logic
[3:13:15] <+MajorCrasher> he's reading the fact that Makoto isn't dead
[3:13:18] <majindusto> Matt complained because he didn't pay attention...Because too serious, not wacky substorys
[3:13:20] <+runegod20> majima is kind of a guy you can read easy, especially since he was a hitman who saved his target even though he had the perfect chance to kill her
[3:13:24] <Blank9> He did protect makoto when he had no reason to while Lee was shot.
[3:13:30] <Doctadaking> The fact that he didn't kill her already is reason enough
[3:13:32] <ghoststalker> India is trying to play the major East Asian powers against each other, but they‚Äôve got their own baggage and trying to get their own shit in order
[3:13:34] <%big_laser_boss> He fought him once and thus he saw Majima's soul
[3:13:34] <+Tucker0603> it's like the line groundskeeper willy gives about the scottish. just applied in asian format
[3:13:38] <%krispen_wa> Matt definitely did not care about serious story
[3:13:43] <Darren716> Also Majima helped fight off the other Yakuza when they tried to kill Lee and kidnap Makoto
[3:13:48] <TTouchdown> It‚Äôs not about being Korean, it‚Äôs about coming from a mafia that behaved like a cult.
[3:13:54] <brachydios777> If Majima was a problem, he would of killed makoto already
[3:13:56] <Komayeda> I think it's like a real thing
[3:13:57] <%Halospaz117> People say it's real
[3:13:59] <ShiningAxis> it's a thing
[3:14:00] <Darren716> It is apparently real, just super rare
[3:14:01] <ThePimpGuin> I only hear about it in anime
[3:14:01] <+BusterRepukken> its real.
[3:14:01] <+Tucker0603> IT'S REAL
[3:14:02] <majindusto> IT CAN HAPPEN
[3:14:04] <penitentpendant> It's real, but it pops up in fiction more than in real life
[3:14:07] <HedgehogGames1> It can apparently happen
[3:14:07] <8bitdana> brain is a weird thing
[3:14:08] <winner_92> the mind can react to trauma in CRAZY ways
[3:14:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Allegedly it is real. The brain does weird stuff
[3:14:10] <enerkaizer> it's very rare, but there are documented cases
[3:14:11] <%r0chelimit> its a plot point in code geass too
[3:14:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> placebo is a thing
[3:14:14] <OldManDeckardCain> PLEASE DON'T PAT THIS WOOLIE
[3:14:16] <fIashman92> Syringe full of acid
[3:14:17] <ShiningAxis> shows up every now and then in media like that one episode of king of the hill
[3:14:19] <MrSparkle21> there's that one king of the hill episode
[3:14:19] <+redux_014> It can happen: Conversion syndrome
[3:14:20] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus there's stories of it happening in the ancient world in battles in Greece
[3:14:22] <+Undenizen> it's incredibly rare but it does exist. however it's VERY popular in soap operas
[3:14:25] <tonberryqueen> PTSD is a so much more serious than people think
[3:14:28] <%Chatterbox1991> Dan Carlin talked about it
[3:14:31] <Darren716> YEYEYEY
[3:14:32] <OblivionSword1> yeah trauma can result in a lot of bizarre shits
[3:14:32] <OokamiDen02> ptsd is some crazy shit
[3:14:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> OH NOOOOOOOOO
[3:14:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OH NO
[3:14:34] <%krispen_wa> HERE WE GO
[3:14:35] <+runegod20> It sounds fake as hell and something that only exist in fiction, but something I'd believe happening in like 1 out of a million people

[3:29:46] <ghoststalker> Not a god(dess), more like a Buddhist saint, yeah
[3:29:53] <OblivionSword1> it's a Buddhist term
[3:29:55] <user_naim> Reading is hard
[3:29:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Damn that lady had a big bag
[3:30:05] <RyuShinden> Goddess of Mercy is different but same acually
[3:30:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> The short of it is a person who's on the path to reach nirvana but stays on the wheel to help others reach it too
[3:30:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Like... ASSASSIN ARTS?!
[3:30:29] <Doctadaking> Now never stop locking on

[3:35:39] <+KillMyPast> DONT PUSH A BUTTON
[3:35:45] <digitalslime> the real challenge with the tiger drop is not useing only it for the whole game
[3:35:45] <+runegod20> huh, now that I look at it, the finisher komeki does look extra familiar too
[3:35:47] <%Holycow8498> and the Tiger Drop in later games is fucking busted

[3:37:19] <Karego_at> yea that's what i thought
[3:37:26] <Karego_at> kiryu gets t drop
[3:37:27] <+duichenko> Get some Tiger Balm for that Tiger Drop
[3:37:31] <Zebroneath> Think of later on, V
[3:37:32] <Karego_at> not majima
[3:37:33] <Mahbonk> Majima is the master of improv
[3:37:36] <+runegod20> i keep forgetting that taunts are a thing
[3:37:37] <Astrophizz> Kiryu gets the move, Majima gets an alternative
[3:37:45] <%big_laser_boss> There are alternatives to the tiger drop, but they're all sub-par in comparison
[3:37:45] <brian_peppers1> oof nerfed
[3:37:50] <Astrophizz> Majima gets the twist
[3:37:53] <andre11dr> I don't remember if you get t drop in this game
[3:37:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[3:38:06] <+runegod20> it's always the eye pokes with majima
[3:38:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> shit i accidentally kicked this old man LUL
[3:38:12] <%notsoy> no, you do not get tiger drop itself in this game
[3:38:18] <Mahbonk> iirc Majima is the one who gets most of the sweet sweet OP counters in 0
[3:38:19] <%notsoy> you do get very similar ones though
[3:38:22] <Doctadaking> Hold left trigger to store heat
[3:38:54] <andre11dr> It sucks that Kiryu is missing some of his future moves
[3:38:56] <digitalslime> can you still hold down lt to not use heat moves or was that not in yet
[3:39:03] <dandragon01> Thats in
[3:39:03] <OblivionSword1> the slow one mostly works on weaker goons
[3:39:08] <velgaduere> wow that hitbox ain't great is it
[3:39:14] <Mahbonk> Kiryu is still a babby in this game :c
[3:39:18] <andre11dr> But i guess it makes sense since this is the past
[3:39:36] <%big_laser_boss> Even the counter Majima gets later, strong as it is, always drains your heat
[3:39:43] <%Holycow8498> The heat bar is kind of like a style meter as well if you aren't using items to boost it
[3:39:44] <%krispen_wa> THAT FACE
[3:39:44] <+Balkespower> RIBS GONE
[3:39:48] <Mahbonk> wtf was that face LUL

[3:40:06] <diontmack> there is sadly no real tiger drop in 0 i think
[3:40:07] <pi_in_the_sci> brawler has a tiger drop equivalent

[3:47:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Komeki's broke Woolie
[3:47:09] <penitentpendant> Do NOT LET SHAKEDOWN LEARN A PROPER FIGHTING STYLE
[3:47:10] <LordOfThePoultry> oh god
[3:47:11] <DeadlyWest> okay now I need to see Komeki absolutely beat the shit out of Shakedown
[3:47:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FeelsBadMan
[3:47:12] <HollowMan190> mmmmmmmmm
[3:47:17] <%krispen_wa> Ultimate Lifeform taught by Komaki would be unstoppable
[3:47:22] <+runegod20> majima does kill a shakedown for breakfast everyday, so majima is still a better choice
[3:47:23] <NorthGrizzly> Komaki would butcher Shakedown
[3:47:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NOT HIS REAL NAME Kappa
[3:47:31] <velgaduere> @penitentpendant it's the only thing keeping Egashira from becoming the apex creature
[3:47:33] <user_naim> DON‚ÄôT teach Shakedowns martial arts
[3:47:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its KOMEKI remember
[3:47:39] <$Nested_Dreams> Super Komeki Shakedown
[3:47:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Is this non consensual learning?
[3:47:59] <DeadlyWest> Majima lives his own way
[3:48:09] <laserbeaming> only one eye for detail, but that's more than enough
[3:48:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you gianed a third eye
[3:48:15] <%krispen_wa> GETTING YOUR EYE GOUGED WAS COOL
[3:48:17] <+runegod20> he only thought you a single move, the rest you pulled out of your ass to win, it's great
[3:48:19] <+bearwagon> LUL
[3:48:19] <+Balkespower> LUL
[3:48:21] <Darren716> Majima going his own way

[3:48:25] <%HollowedIdjit> Ultimate Style: NO STYLE
[3:48:27] <%LastHazzerd> Sigmajima
[3:48:28] <penitentpendant> Term COINED
[3:48:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> "I found an eyepatch"
[3:48:39] <enerkaizer> remember woolie: majima copied Mr. Libidos dance perfectly without practicing it.
[3:48:40] <Karego_at> lose an eye, find madness
[3:48:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> @enerkaizer "Holy shit!"
[3:48:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> underground

[3:49:50] <heylookitswex> look at the cats on the booth
[3:49:51] <+runegod20> probably best to save over two different save lots just to be safe
[3:49:52] <Darren716> Yeyeye
[3:49:54] <winner_92> man i want to replay this game now
[3:49:56] <penitentpendant> Rotating Saves honestly comes from situations like these
[3:49:56] <OldManDeckardCain> pc master race Kappa
[3:49:56] <%Holycow8498> Oh hey there's cats on top of that phone box
[3:49:58] <enerkaizer> The place were legends were revealed to be true
[3:50:07] <candidateplays> What if Hannyra-man become Komeki's disciple?
[3:50:08] <majindusto> IT WAS PERFECTLY FINE ON PS4
[3:50:09] <+runegod20> or checking the inventory each time to make sure your sword isn't fried cheese or something
[3:50:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie you reloaded a previous save a month ago that's all

[3:50:57] <ghoststalker> Ghost people on that bench disappeared as soon as the fight started lol
[3:50:58] <%krispen_wa> DEAD
[3:51:00] <penitentpendant> You DO have to be in the 3rd bar though
[3:51:02] <+runegod20> also doesn't have to be at 3 heat to do it, which is nice
[3:51:03] <winner_92> hmmm, suspicious
[3:51:05] <PortableBoredom> Is there a reason Woolie keeps spamming heavy attacks?
[3:51:16] <%big_laser_boss> except if you miss, he counters the grab
[3:51:16] <Darren716> Big number
[3:51:35] <%big_laser_boss> @runegod20 it actually has

[3:53:21] <dukenux> LUL
[3:53:22] <+Balkespower> LUL
[3:53:24] <Doctadaking> No animations allowed
[3:53:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> too much asset
[3:53:26] <winner_92> money run out
[3:53:28] <%psidefx> Thats money we dont have
[3:53:34] <ghoststalker> LUL
[3:53:34] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> No time
[3:53:37] <%big_laser_boss> @runegod20 as I said earlier; it's more for style than practicality
[3:53:40] <Mahbonk> might as well turn this game into a Visual Novel Kappa
[3:53:44] <%jinking79> no pitcher mini game
[3:53:44] <Darren716> Kappa
[3:53:47] <Ultimatefool> We had these animations from the last 4 games so fuck you A pose it is
[3:53:56] <zanzibarian_hamster> Are the yakuzas a low budget series? I'd imagine they are considering the map is always the same
[3:54:06] <Mahbonk> yeah pretty much
[3:54:11] <CeosDT> Yo Angelo
[3:54:16] <+BusterRepukken> Yakuza 7 probably has the most money put into it.
[3:54:23] <Doctadaking> Youll get pump fist animation and you'll like it
[3:54:29] <Mahbonk> Even the Dragon Engine games suffers from a bit of laziness from the devs
[3:54:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> old enough to be a ddaddy though
[3:54:30] <Darren716> zanzibarian_hamster They put their money into the story
[3:54:35] <DeadlyWest> @zanzibarian_hamster Yeah, Yakuza 1-5 were pretty much budget titles as far as I know
[3:54:35] <Equirah> Getting bad vibes out of this
[3:54:44] <+runegod20> i think less that the series is low budget but more that they asset reuse alot, it's a part of the charm
[3:54:45] <liljojofett> And he became shinada

[3:57:09] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus but can you live with the consequences of your decision tho?
[3:57:09] <Doctadaking> This is Yakuza. Youd be surprised at the level of body changing tech
[3:57:11] <%solracc25> Family is a liability
[3:57:17] <+PkSilent01> So you telling me his FACE was OFF
[3:57:21] <$Nested_Dreams> Wait, but the mom and kid didn't look grieving, were they over him already?
[3:57:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> A greater distance maybe
[3:57:28] <Darren716> About 20 feet
[3:57:37] <dukenux> 10 meters is a safe distance?
[3:57:38] <+duichenko> get binoculars my dude
[3:57:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and then u get sent to an Oil Prison Refienery with magnet boots
[3:57:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> And then you tell this all to a random stranger
[3:58:11] <user_naim> Give the son a butterfly knife

[4:00:14] <+runegod20> they're giant dorks, but they just don't show it as much in the main story
[4:00:15] <velgaduere> and sidequest Majima is the same person as regular Majima
[4:00:17] <dukenux> R)

[4:00:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> huh, society...
[4:00:35] <Darren716> I wonder if they made Ichiban the way he is as a result of how side quests in this series have gone
[4:00:39] <brachydios777> Side quest Kiryu is more stoic
[4:00:43] <%Javaa01> Man... *horse looking into the sea*
[4:00:44] <penitentpendant> Much got done
[4:00:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL Face/Off killed Woolie
[4:00:47] <chainsaw105> this adventure sure is bizarre
[4:00:48] <dukenux> huMAN after all
[4:00:49] <Darren716> Since he's pretty much the same guy in story and sub stories
[4:00:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i mean Ichiban is more responsive
[4:00:54] <andre11dr> Oh the quest is already back
[4:00:58] <DedlokPM> Story Kiryu and Majima: teenSTARE Sidequest Kiryu and Majima: ronanSmeel

[4:01:23] <chainsaw105> are there cats on top of that payphone?
[4:01:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @pksilent01 Kappa
[4:01:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its a story plot
[4:01:27] <penitentpendant> Main Story unlocks it
[4:01:37] <brian_peppers1> WHY
[4:01:38] <penitentpendant> That's more than fair
[4:01:39] <OblivionSword1> yeah main plot unlocks it
[4:01:41] <Karego_at> the fuck i love it
[4:01:41] <+runegod20> it's locked to the main story in the same way kiryu's business is locked into the story
[4:01:42] <+rrratbastard> woolie's stand just causes weird glitch shenanigans
[4:01:42] <Doctadaking> So wrong
[4:01:42] <+KillMyPast> ITS FUCKING GREAT
[4:01:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> V with the takes again
[4:01:43] <chainsaw105> its the BEST
[4:01:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus you loaded an older save one day, if you look at one stream you saved, did the tax quest, saved again, ended the stream, then next stream you started from the save before the quest
[4:01:44] <Darren716> V's nuts
[4:01:45] <+Ancopro> lloved it
[4:01:46] <+Balkespower> WRONG
[4:01:47] <$StaceMcGate> Majima Business is the best
[4:01:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> V wrong for once
[4:01:49] <fIashman92> It's the best
[4:01:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE NO
[4:01:49] <+Awkward_Cyborg> V's nuts
[4:01:49] <brian_peppers1> ITS THE BEST
[4:01:50] <brachydios777> I like it
[4:01:51] <Felto3> cabaret club is great
[4:01:52] <Zebroneath> LUL
[4:01:52] <TheCrispyBoi> it good tho
[4:01:52] <winner_92> how can one man be so right about peanut butter but so wrong about minigames
[4:01:53] <Prevot> big wrong
[4:01:53] <+mattersnotnow> best game
[4:01:54] <Karego_at> majima's business is so good???
[4:01:57] <majindusto> V HAS BAD TASTE
[4:01:58] <andre11dr> I feel that Woolie will like it
[4:01:58] <LordOfThePoultry> v is nuts
[4:02:00] <Timarkot> Its the worst
[4:02:00] <ghoststalker> V wrong
[4:02:01] <turbofolk> Ah of course you would think like that V
[4:02:01] <+FuqBoiSlim> Little L Mills
[4:02:01] <+rrratbastard> V'S SO WRONG
[4:02:02] <OldManDeckardCain> V is as wrong about this as he is about yakuza 2 LUL
[4:02:03] <mrblack499> yep
[4:02:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I wannnaaaa beeee your giiiirl~
[4:02:05] <Karego_at> trash taste
[4:02:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DO NOT BELIEVE V'S HERESY
[4:02:07] <+ScottishMadJacko> Man, V just has some wrong opinions every now and then huh
[4:02:07] <Mattais88> buisness is fun but not enough money rewarded
[4:02:10] <digitalslime> It drags in the middle but I like it overall
[4:02:10] <Darren716> Reminder: V thinks 3 is better than both Kiwami's
[4:02:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> V you're the worst
[4:02:11] <%krispen_wa> V is the WRONGEST
[4:02:12] <%big_laser_boss> way less money, way more actually unique gameplay
[4:02:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> But the old ones are bad
[4:02:16] <Karego_at> YESS!!!! it's so gooood
[4:02:16] <%Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:02:16] <lovesosa236> this guy eats oil peanut better don't trust him LUL
[4:02:17] <+dereksg> No it‚Äôs the best
[4:02:18] <fIashman92> You and your peanut butter are not welcome in our club
[4:02:18] <brian_peppers1> Yakuza 0 has the best one tho
[4:02:22] <chainsaw105> I wanna beeee your giiiiirrrrl oooooooOOOoo
[4:02:24] <%ChoculaUltra> Cabaret Kiwami
[4:02:25] <penitentpendant> Inescabable
[4:02:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yakuza 3-4 can go to hell
[4:02:26] <Astrophizz> the dating and lecturing game sucks
[4:02:28] <+Awkward_Cyborg> Cabaret Club is the best!!!
[4:02:31] <%krispen_wa> I swear to god if V influences Woolie not to play it
[4:02:31] <velgaduere> V is wrong on purpose. he's playing the long game
[4:02:31] <Doctadaking> Its bad in 3 and 4
[4:02:31] <+Plesin> Cabaret is fun V is just a square
[4:02:34] <TheCrispyBoi> IT'S THE BEST
[4:02:34] <+coldsama> Old game Cabared was so shit
[4:02:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 3-4 cabaret can go to hell
[4:02:38] <%notsoy> cabaret clubs as dating sims are whatever, the 0/k2 business side is way better
[4:02:39] <Mahbonk> i hate the cabaret in other games
[4:02:40] <jotabranded> come on V
[4:02:41] <brokencr0ss> Oh fuck yeah I haven‚Äôt played Kiwami 2 onwards I‚Äôm hyped
[4:02:41] <majindusto> 0/Kiwami2 CABARET IS THE BEST!!!
[4:02:42] <%Holycow8498> Its definitely a bit weird
[4:02:44] <andre11dr> Yea, the dating one sucks
[4:02:47] <winner_92> pat is ALSO WRONG !
[4:02:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pats baddest takes
[4:02:48] <digitalslime> 3 & 4 clubs suck
[4:02:49] <Trigon_Trey> they even have a cabaret in fist of the north star lmao
[4:02:54] <%HollowedIdjit> There's one in the HNK Yakuza game too!
[4:02:57] <%big_laser_boss> this one is the best
[4:03:08] <majindusto> PAT IS ALSO WRONG
[4:03:08] <winner_92> pocket fighter and cabaret club are both great in yakuza 0
[4:03:12] <%Holycow8498> business is completely optional
[4:03:12] <andre11dr> Does pat even have good takes?
[4:03:12] <penitentpendant> "So I grinded Cabaret offscreen."
[4:03:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FUCK NO
[4:03:18] <+MajorCrasher> it's 100% optional
[4:03:28] <%krispen_wa> Stop coloring his views
[4:03:35] <turbofolk> @andre11dr Its not even that, you just sit your ass down and listen to them moan about shit, you dont even succ out of it
[4:03:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Fishing is a bit more in depth in 3?
[4:03:39] <+BusterRepukken> Yakuza 6's fishing is great
[4:03:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kappa
[4:03:52] <+duichenko> buying bait every timr

[4:04:29] <brokencr0ss> Cabaret club has best girl though
[4:04:30] <$Spydurman> Good thing V is super wrong and the cabaret game is great
[4:04:30] <+Awkward_Cyborg> V is wrong for once

[4:06:08] <%doomerskeletor13> They‚Äôre both good, choose your own flavor

[4:06:09] <DedlokPM> Either is fine
[4:06:09] <@akuda_bar> i want to see who wins the war
[4:06:10] <Darren716> The Dub is way better for the LP
[4:06:12] <asdief_> Neutral spanish
[4:06:13] <%illtima> Dub for 7 is amazing
[4:06:13] <Mattais88> Hijiyama from 13 sentinels is MC
[4:06:14] <Afrosamasenpai> I got $50 on TEAM SUB
[4:06:14] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> The dub is pretty good
[4:06:14] <Mahbonk> Fuck you, Twitch Chat :)
[4:06:16] <OblivionSword1> just like 13 sentinels the DUB is great
[4:06:17] <TheCrispyBoi> dub is super good
[4:06:17] <chainsaw105> dub is good but Ichiban's dub karaoke song is hot trash
[4:06:17] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SUBDUB WAR

[4:06:37] <%illtima> WOOLIE, Pat told you that Ichiban has the same English VA as Hijiyama! Himbo rights!
[4:06:37] <Darren716> Like the Dub is legit good and it works way better for streaming/youtube
[4:06:37] <Qu1ckyyy> He's tottaly gonna do whatever he wants
[4:06:41] <Karego_at> honestly this is the hill i die on
[4:06:45] <%sillyschlub> PowerUpL woolieVS PowerUpR
[4:06:45] <@akuda_bar> post woolieS for sub woolieT for dub
[4:06:46] <Karego_at> subs all the way
[4:06:48] <Mahbonk> @chainsaw105 ugh they really murdered Machine Gun kiss

[4:06:54] <andre11dr> So it won't matter, got it
[4:06:54] <%LastHazzerd> some idiots sure like capslock
[4:06:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SUBS HAVE AUTHENTIC VOICES Kappa
[4:06:55] <penitentpendant> Ah a "Pat Poll"
[4:06:57] <OldManDeckardCain> so just like elections Kappa
[4:06:57] <DedlokPM> woolieS woolieT
[4:06:59] <+BusterRepukken> Dubbed Karoake is bad.
[4:07:01] <$Nested_Dreams> revWi revDe
[4:07:01] <notorious_rng> only ichiban's va is good in the dub
[4:07:05] <%sillyschlub> woolieF woolieU
[4:07:09] <%LastHazzerd> @BusterRepukken smh
[4:07:10] <Doctadaking> I mean, Pat did dub and it was fine
[4:07:13] <turbofolk> But are you willing to listen to audio samples of both audios
[4:07:16] <OblivionSword1> it is QUALITY
[4:07:16] <%itschickenscratch> dubs are just easier to follow along on a stream
[4:07:17] <%ZweihanderSteve> i missed what made woolie want to pause Y0 and play Y7.
[4:07:17] <%phd_in_thuggery> woolieF woolieU woolieF woolieU woolieF woolieU
[4:07:17] <%big_laser_boss> if this quick-look will be unrelated to Woolie's eventual playthrough in 2026 than now would be a good time to try it.
[4:07:18] <+texmexorcist> In honesty, I like the sub, but it doesn't matter much to me.
[4:07:19] <Mahbonk> Karaoke is mostly bad in english. But the rest is amazing
[4:07:20] <CoffeeSlice> dude, dub was amazing
[4:07:21] <Darren716> @WoolieVersus I played through with subs and watched Pat's play through with the dub. Play with the dub, it's better
[4:07:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> V is based
[4:07:23] <Karego_at> @notorious_rng yea majima's va is ass
[4:07:24] <penitentpendant> Dub'll save your voice
[4:07:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> V is cultured
[4:07:27] <majindusto> Quality OG actors
[4:07:27] <fIashman92> Bad karaoke is better
[4:07:28] <Karego_at> good va but not for majima
[4:07:37] <Tardispardis> no dub pls
[4:07:38] <%phd_in_thuggery> Literally flip a coin for it
[4:07:40] <%LastHazzerd> screw the minimizers, if you want dub you gotta want it for the quality
[4:07:43] <ghoststalker> I respect Ichiban‚Äôs dub voice, but Nishiki‚Äôs VA is amazing
[4:07:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOOLIE AKIO OTSUKA IS IN SUB
[4:07:49] <+duichenko> nier automata yess
[4:07:50] <ghoststalker> And yeah, original language rights
[4:07:52] <andre11dr> I played 7 in Japanese, so i don't know
[4:07:53] <chainsaw105> doesn't everyone say Cowboy Bebop is better dubbed?
[4:07:54] <jotabranded> ORIGINAL NIER IS GODLIKE
[4:07:54] <velgaduere> the main characters in the English dub are voiced primarily by Americans of Asian heritage. they deserve support them
[4:07:54] <Karego_at> gotta do it for nishiki's va
[4:07:55] <Mattais88> George Takei too
[4:07:55] <Mahbonk> i honestly rarely saw any streamers playing Automata in japanese
[4:07:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie I want to sell you Akio Otsuka
[4:07:58] <Karego_at> exactly v
[4:07:58] <OblivionSword1> true
[4:08:00] <%doomerskeletor13> I played both, cause I did two playthroughs. People acting like one is superior are just being dorks
[4:08:00] <%phd_in_thuggery> HAAHAAA
[4:08:01] <$Spydurman> ?????
[4:08:03] <Karego_at> original all the way
[4:08:04] <notorious_rng> thats true woolie can't miss out on akio otsuka
[4:08:05] <+duichenko> huhhhhh
[4:08:06] <andre11dr> No
[4:08:06] <penitentpendant> George Takei in Dub though
[4:08:06] <%big_laser_boss> I really don't have a strong opinion on this though
[4:08:08] <PsychoPearl> Play sub for Nishiki voice
[4:08:08] <Mahbonk> SourPls
[4:08:09] <%LastHazzerd> what?
[4:08:09] <Equirah> for some stuff i can't stand the JP pandering, enough with high picthed females and kids
[4:08:10] <+KillMyPast> A little different
[4:08:12] <xbb1024> These games were written knowing that the English market exists
[4:08:13] <Tardispardis> V is right
[4:08:15] <+TrevSmith222> I enjoy dubs, but watching middle aged Japanese men speaking perfect English in Japan is weird to me.
[4:08:15] <+MajorCrasher> songs are entirely different
[4:08:17] <bonebagMEL> Doesn't hit the same
[4:08:17] <%itschickenscratch> but you could listen to an english cover of a japanese song
[4:08:18] <digitalslime> I would curious, sounds bad
[4:08:21] <$Nested_Dreams> Nier Automata felt natural in english, Yakuza feels natural in JP
[4:08:23] <@akuda_bar> twitch will never dmca it because it doesnt sound like anything LUL
[4:08:25] <%LastHazzerd> V is a music man, of course
[4:08:26] <%Holycow8498> Songs are entirely different than a movie or video game
[4:08:27] <%itschickenscratch> you do covers, V
[4:08:28] <TheCrispyBoi> you, you hate
[4:08:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Raid Pat?
[4:08:38] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[4:08:40] <majindusto> There is English Rammstein songs tho lol
[4:08:40] <Equirah> so 4 then LUL
[4:08:50] <Doctadaking> I just play both dub and sub in 2 playthroughs
[4:08:50] <brokencr0ss> Yea the few Rammstein songs they did English versions for are fucking weird
[4:08:51] <%LastHazzerd> @itschickenscratch he sang the yak covers in Japanese

[4:09:33] <chainsaw105> oh so like back when you guys streamed it years ago
[4:09:33] <andre11dr> Unless 1-4 takes forever, he should finish in 2 sessions
[4:09:36] <Darren716> That was perfect
[4:09:41] <%itschickenscratch> @itschickenscratch I'm just sayin he can respect the performance of others giving their take on something in another language
[4:10:26] <%HollowedIdjit> not quite Rammstein, but I don't mind E Nomine in English
[4:10:48] <OldManDeckardCain> sigh, there goes another kink

[4:17:52] <%ChoculaUltra> propose then teleport into the mech. This is the true proposal.
[4:17:53] <%aram909> shenmue is dumb thats all i have to say
[4:17:58] <OblivionSword1> Yakuza is a JRPG
[4:18:06] <%LastHazzerd> i can see the point and click aspect in that... it's obtuse
[4:18:11] <fIashman92> Shenmue is a point and click game straight up
[4:18:17] <%aram909> yakuza is a jrpg, shenmue was a failed experiment that had soooooooome good ideas but was mostly not good
[4:18:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:18:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yakuza has evolved so much that it feels like nothing like Shenmue at all now
[4:18:26] <%phd_in_thuggery> Shenmue 3 was the biggest turd I love it
[4:18:29] <%LastHazzerd> Shenmu III
[4:18:31] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @BallerSwagBro9k
[4:18:38] <%aram909> Shenmue 3 more like ShenNo 3
[4:18:46] <%LastHazzerd> Moobot forced to do a lot of work this stream
[4:18:51] <andre11dr> Shenmue might have been good at some point in time, but i think going back to it's trash
[4:18:52] <%aram909> Shenmue more like Shenpoo
[4:19:06] <joshua_42> Did Woolie get to Majima‚Äôs minigame?
