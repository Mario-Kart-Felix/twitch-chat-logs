[0:15:54] <Dave_VD> Every album has stinker tracks that aren't worth the time
[0:15:57] <exnuart> whole album then take out the crap songs
[0:15:57] <+Rose_Silvers> I listen to just the chorus of a song sometimes and turn it off once its over
[0:15:58] <heart_ablaze> I apologize for disliking a song v LUL
[0:16:02] <notgoodatnamessorry> I feel like it depends on which album for me.
[0:16:02] <dinnydanny777> The true way is spamming the shuffle button over and over again until you start with a song you like and then losing interest when it plays the next song
[0:16:03] <elysium1092> elysium1092 is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel!

[0:17:11] <RyuShinden> B-but I want you to be my dad V D:

[0:19:03] <+AnIrishPapaya> So then what are your thoughts on Crawfish?
[0:19:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Good food with annoying process is not good food
[0:19:05] <%HollowedIdjit> EATING BEANS I SEE
[0:19:05] <+yusefHD> Edamame = Cheese strings
[0:19:06] <+Mrbaconator> i guessed he would say 3 lets goooo
[0:19:07] <dabeaminator> There's a ritual to eating them from the pod.
[0:19:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Inconvenient food
[0:19:09] <Karego_at> TRUCE
[0:19:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Cashew Nuts are POG
[0:19:16] <+Zanzibar_Junker> The kind at the bar leaves it in the pod
[0:19:18] <+runegod20> i'd rather eat edamane than a peanut in a shell, edamane is way easier to eat and less messy
[0:19:19] <Asuterisuku> Pistachios are the same.
[0:19:19] <%Lion_kun> Try chilli on edamame.
[0:19:20] <CappuccinoGuil> That's why ribs on the bone suck
[0:19:23] <%X2Eliah> Tru fax. Edamame is just a salt delivery system
[0:19:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytFILTH
[0:19:30] <DasFreekman> same for boiled peanuts?
[0:19:33] <%dreadedcthulhu> oh god the sunflower seed convo with reggie...
[0:19:36] <dinnydanny777> It's like having to eat marzipan in a cake NotLikeThis
[0:19:37] <exnuart> remember to eat edamame with the next party member
[0:19:38] <%dreadedcthulhu> Giovanna is based

[0:19:46] <@Solidus_113> She's a good starter character
[0:19:47] <+Mrbaconator> giovanna needs more DOG STUFF
[0:19:49] <Xelhesia> i love gio
[0:19:50] <$QueequegTheater> Edamame is a vegetable and therefore disgusting
[0:19:51] <+projectmanatees> the bass in that song
[0:19:56] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus Didnt you and V have an argument with the same concept, but with Crab instead?
[0:19:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Giorno Giovanna
[0:19:57] <Polar_Bair_8> I mean, if someone else finds her boring don't let that stop you lol
[0:19:58] <Wahrow> People are trying to recreate the Peanut Butter fight
[0:19:59] <leith_aziz> She's a good beginner character
[0:20:00] <%kinetikpaws> i just liked her chun li kicks
[0:20:01] <%Juriasu> I think she is supposed to be a good jumping in point from other games
[0:20:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> WOOLIE HATES IT
[0:20:03] <leith_aziz> Shich is fine
[0:20:04] <Asuterisuku> Eye to Eye has grown on me.
[0:20:05] <dabeaminator> If you gave Gio a fireball she'd basically be Kum Haehyun.
[0:20:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Got it
[0:20:08] <notorious_rng> I could see Giovanna getting way more stuff in later revisions
[0:20:09] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Giovanna is bland Kim Kaphwan
[0:20:13] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Gio is fun but super straight forward
[0:20:15] <+Jiggisnipe> it's a cool ass scarf
[0:20:19] <+yusefHD> Boneless Eddie
[0:20:23] <exnuart> what if doggo was like leeroy's?
[0:20:24] <+FrostedZaibatsu> All Guilty Gear characters are boss characters. She doesnt feel like a boss
[0:20:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gio top tier got it
[0:20:30] <+McSoliace> she has a cool super
[0:20:31] <arielanarchy92> Yeah im pretty disappointed hearing and seeing that cuz I dig her design.
[0:20:32] <BlackermanZX> Giovanna has some nuance
[0:20:33] <leith_aziz> To me, I loved Sol and Leo
[0:20:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Micro Walks and Half Presses Kappa
[0:20:47] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Kim Kaphwan and the family are better
[0:20:47] <Asuterisuku> I'm glad I-No's back. But I wanna touch doggo girl.
[0:20:48] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Gio Pressure PogChamp
[0:20:50] <%kewlmyc> Choose May and do dolphin combos
[0:20:50] <+bustawof> Pot is a goddam monster
[0:20:57] <$QueequegTheater> V is scared
[0:20:59] <leith_aziz> For the new characters, I leaned more towards Nago, who I loved
[0:21:00] <+yusefHD> [Screams in Makoto]
[0:21:01] <xdeathknightx> is it like a cripwalk?
[0:21:07] <%dreadedcthulhu> gio felt rly accessible to me but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[0:21:09] <Lobster_Lord> FANG micro walks in SFV are crazy strong
[0:21:10] <%X2Eliah> Microwalk sounds like a lazy person's definition of exercise
[0:21:13] <leith_aziz> Also, I wanna try I-No now

[0:21:30] <wibbwobbler> that's crazy
[0:21:33] <+runegod20> i don't actually know what a micro walk is but i'm pretty sure i have a basic idea, tiny movement input
[0:21:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:21:39] <%dreadedcthulhu> @queequegtheater same
[0:21:39] <%kinetikpaws> yea its pure aesthetic for me
[0:21:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> anytime i see a fighting game term the image of the iceberg flashes in my mind
[0:21:45] <+DarkNerdShawny> does she play like Chie?
[0:21:48] <%HollowedIdjit> Aesthetic First
[0:21:48] <leith_aziz> EVERYONE in Strive looks cool. Seriously
[0:21:57] <%X2Eliah> ... true
[0:21:57] <%Arancet> she just seemed too disadvantaged to the crazy reach dominating chars
[0:21:58] <leith_aziz> I love I-No's redesign
[0:22:00] <@Solidus_113> you can end combos early without microwalks and still get good damage
[0:22:01] <TheyCallMeVawn> Smoking looks pretty cool
[0:22:03] <leith_aziz> Same for Sol and Leo
[0:22:04] <DasFreekman> @queequegtheater thats why I'm maining potemkin
[0:22:05] <Tham1k> Press button have fun
[0:22:13] <exnuart> drinking and driving looks cool
[0:22:13] <%kewlmyc> kewlmyc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! I am also getting into Strive, and I'm going May. Am I a degenerate piece of shit for wanting dolphin combos?
[0:22:14] <leith_aziz> Yep
[0:22:15] <$QueequegTheater> I mained Skarlet, Juri, Valentine, and now Giovanna/Ino. I have a type.
[0:22:15] <%jinking79> i got Leo back I'm satisfied

[0:22:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Rule of cool
[0:22:29] <+runegod20> well, it being fun is just as important as it being cool
[0:22:37] <%X2Eliah> wow moobot.
[0:22:39] <%X2Eliah> that's cold.
[0:22:44] <+sonofthedeepsouth> DEATH

[0:22:48] <fIashman92> That's on XBL
[0:22:49] <%HollowedIdjit> SHIT
[0:22:49] <revoltingimp> Denieeeeed
[0:22:52] <dabeaminator> Strive's beta was my first fighting game (I've since gone back to Xrd) and I picked Gio. I did alright with her, I don't think you NEED all of the fine tech to make her work.
[0:22:52] <DSD24> Wasn't that piece of news made up?
[0:22:53] <Asuterisuku> Except you won't be able to play it after the server shutdown either.
[0:22:53] <leith_aziz> Its just too bad about his health
[0:22:55] <$QueequegTheater> MOOBOT PASSES JUDGEMENT
[0:23:00] <leith_aziz> Shame
[0:23:00] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Hard Corps Rising is A+
[0:23:02] <Prevot> suck Fony

[0:23:10] <$QueequegTheater> Fuck Jim Ryan
[0:23:12] <Tardispardis> RYAAAAAAN!
[0:23:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BASED PIRACY
[0:23:16] <DSD24> That was a bad take
[0:23:18] <leith_aziz> I love RC Trilogy, but its only on PS3
[0:23:23] <%BusterRepukken> 'who wants to play old games'
[0:23:25] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BECOME PIRATE
[0:23:27] <+condemned_15> Jaffe hasn't been relevant in years
[0:23:28] <leith_aziz> What did he say.......
[0:23:31] <exnuart> hard corps uprising also has Sayuki, the ronin waifu
[0:23:33] <357Sneak> there are still a lot of games I gotta get from there, dang
[0:23:34] <%kewlmyc> who?
[0:23:37] <+yusefHD> Reject humanity, return to piracy
[0:23:38] <Pappajimbo> just walk away
[0:23:46] <leith_aziz> Emulation needs to become legal in the future
[0:23:48] <+runegod20> it's sad, but 15 years is a super long time to support an online store, especially since it hasn't been relevant in a long time
[0:23:49] <masterfire23> We're all one dumb take away from getting canceled
[0:23:51] <DSD24> Buy Soul Sacrifice Delta!
[0:23:52] <%BusterRepukken> 'graphics old so game bad'
[0:23:52] <+robo_trunk> RIP Vita
[0:23:52] <nchlada> Or you could not TPFufun
[0:23:53] <wibbwobbler> i just don't get it is pretty convenient
[0:23:55] <DasFreekman> OH GOD I didnt realize Tokyo Jungle would get hit...
[0:23:57] <$QueequegTheater> @kewlmyc Jim Ryan is the head of Sony sales division, David Jaffe is the director of God of War 1
[0:23:59] <%jinking79> MVC2 Free online DIE in psn
[0:24:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> What does classic mean? Only play new thing!
[0:24:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> AHOY ME MATIES
[0:24:08] <%X2Eliah> That's not the future tho
[0:24:09] <%ZweihanderSteve> WE WISH
[0:24:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BECOME PHYSICAL
[0:24:09] <dabeaminator> This is why the Digital PS5 scares me.
[0:24:10] <TheyCallMeVawn> You know whats great. Emulation.
[0:24:12] <+michingmallecho> Reject legality, become pirate
[0:24:12] <muddiestpath> sounds a lot like yo ho ho
[0:24:13] <VidulaSaix> That's one big reason I decided to go physical again with PS5
[0:24:15] <morningmoondude> so many games don't get physical anymore :/
[0:24:17] <%BusterRepukken> turns out owning PS4 discs doesnt matter either cause of the battery
[0:24:22] <linSP> REJECT VIRTUAL
[0:24:23] <%X2Eliah> The future is streaming games like video from spacex satellites
[0:24:24] <pi_in_the_sci> Art is as mortal as the rest of us, good thing die, it's the nature of things
[0:24:28] <Qu1ckyyy> Not if it doesn't exist in your country
[0:24:31] <deafmelone> Wait MVC2 is in trouble?
[0:24:33] <malbarrough> Physical is not much better, you can still have BS DRM that blocks physical copies.
[0:24:36] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Yakuza 5 used to be only digital
[0:24:37] <Dante_Namikaze1> this is why I have to get physical
[0:24:38] <leith_aziz> Yes, but sometimes you want them on sale, or in my case, my PC doesnt have storage rof Discs
[0:24:39] <Asuterisuku> RIP My Life as a Dark Lord.
[0:24:39] <shinichizio> I shall defeat death forever.

[0:49:12] <plaguedoctor_syan> the bad thing about Mahjong in yakuza is that is not the same thing than real life mahjong i was watching a video explaing it and is not as complicated as the game make it sound like

[0:49:15] <Solidnick18> LUL

[0:49:40] <+zylomarkiii> BIG DAMAGE.
[0:49:50] <leith_aziz> The Secret Korean shit wouldnt seem as dumb if they had more characeteristics then "They are stealthy Koreans"
[0:49:57] <DasFreekman> its that ond alley thats blocked off, the outside is still explorable
[0:50:01] <%MonsterEnvy> Block woolie

[0:50:12] <Solidnick18> haven't gotten to my favorite enemy name lol
[0:50:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> R E S I S T
[0:50:33] <exnuart> tribes are weak to blade i think
[0:50:36] <@Solidus_113> zonked out
[0:50:41] <Tardispardis> gotta mash that square like hell
[0:50:42] <+runegod20> could be weak to magic?
[0:50:43] <NorthGrizzly> You can now auto heal
[0:50:44] <+QueequegTheater> He's weak to getting fucking stabbed
[0:50:45] <%MajorCrasher> LUL

[0:51:06] <%DrJamesWoods> Nice
[0:51:09] <leith_aziz> ah
[0:51:13] <solracc25> cut
[0:51:16] <twohitgood> just like James hetfield
[0:51:17] <artoflec> theres an entire enemy family that is based around assholes with more and more tribal tattoos
[0:51:18] <skyentombment> They're weak to job applications
[0:51:25] <%hologram_sam> *sharp objects! my only weakness!"
[0:51:26] <%andrewofbob> Is anything weak to bullets?
[0:51:27] <outofthemox> i don't think a lot of people are "resistant to fire" lol
[0:51:29] <%DrJamesWoods> I ended up fighting a group of 5 my first time in Koreatown
[0:51:32] <Sternieliscious> Knowing nothing, I sure hope there's a guy with a pool cue called Street Shark.
[0:51:32] <pi_in_the_sci> there's an auto-heal button
[0:51:41] <+runegod20> he's not wearing any sleeves to show off his tattoo, so the fire effects him more
[0:51:54] <Solidnick18> yes
[0:51:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PAT.jpg
[0:51:55] <NorthGrizzly> PAT
[0:51:59] <+mikesapartment> maybe he has a phase 3!
[0:51:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> But what if there's a bonus boss?
[0:52:01] <+duichenko> Did I miss any story related content?
[0:52:04] <artoflec> patzd
[0:52:05] <+MagiKestral> the farther north you get, the tougher enemies will be! you can explore the whole map, but save often
[0:52:06] <+runegod20> even then, we're at the point in the game where the 50 heal items aren't as useful in combat with how much health we have, so they're perfect for using out of battle
[0:52:10] <Asuterisuku> The game is making an effort to keep you poor at this point.
[0:52:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> What if a DLC comes out? monkaS
[0:52:17] <%MajorCrasher> @duichenko nope
[0:52:18] <exnuart> just buy out a poppo honestly, weak healing items are still good late game
[0:52:25] <+LeosQuaint> Persimmon?
[0:52:27] <%DkLordG> @duichenko nah, we about to plot now tho
[0:52:30] <+The_Death_Owl> Mind Goblin alert

[0:52:40] <+Sleepy_Puma> Bakkkkkaaa
[0:52:42] <Tardispardis> Hey Chat, what would Pat's enemy name be in this game? :D
[0:52:49] <Astrophizz> I don't touch staminan sparks
[0:52:53] <+duichenko> @majorcrasher @dklordg Nicee thanks
[0:53:00] <+runegod20> in games where each invidual item doesn't take up it's own inventory slot, stocking up on cheap low level healing item is great for between fights
[0:53:00] <+QueequegTheater> Oh man Woolie's gonna miss Sae, Gamagoori, AND Snake in the dub because of the stream timing
[0:53:03] <DedlokPM> @Tardispardis Orb Man

[0:55:37] <+McSoliace> its hard to tell the phone is cutting out in jp
[0:55:38] <sperium3000> @GarbageNirvana Not if they adjust the volumes on both phones
[0:55:43] <%TheMoenia> it sounds way threatening
[0:55:44] <VidulaSaix> Sub here does make it a bit hard to tell
[0:55:48] <TheyCallMeVawn> But is it the Yakuza
[0:55:58] <dinnydanny777> Polite feigned civility is more threatening
[0:56:05] <Asuterisuku> Something about an arranged marriage?

[1:22:30] <Seraphim9> eagle is 2, tekken is 3
[1:22:34] <sperium3000> And he seemed sure about that last one too. I guess Ichiban's motions during the test are not indicative of if you got it right or wrong

[1:22:58] <%BestTeaMaker> these tests are expensive
[1:23:00] <leith_aziz> I would do the rest, but they are EXPENSIVE
[1:23:00] <dante_suoh> The math such without a guide
[1:23:02] <Darren716> Like the cheapest is 30k
[1:23:03] <Tardispardis> These are pretty expensive early i nthe game

[1:23:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:23:43] <%cache_22> Exams are _the_ way to level up some of these skills, but they are expensive so they are mostly for mid-late game.
[1:23:44] <%akuda_bar> oh these tests must be so much harder if it were written in english for japanese players
[1:23:45] <urkleturtle> the math ones are actually really tough with the time limit

[1:23:48] <Darren716> This isn't just an English school

[2:43:49] <+tigerfang86> THEMATICALLY, THIS IS FINE
[2:43:49] <CappuccinoGuil> There's like, 1-2 lines you could change in that 1st scene to make this ALL work. Like, FUCK
[2:43:49] <Deasmeister> This bit is the worst
[2:43:50] <+CookieCutter007> "Just a an asshole"
[2:43:50] <$dudedude55555> life ain't black and white, woolz
[2:43:51] <+AugustRei> he literally is a different character now

[2:44:00] <malbarrough> Trying to pull a "on period" excuse to frequently
[2:44:05] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> I don‚Äôt think it about him actually being a hero, it‚Äôs just he‚Äôs a dick who wants to help
[2:44:06] <jorniev> I would BUY it way more if he apologize d for being so shitty
[2:44:08] <keigatide> Does Woolie have an instagram with feet or shirtless pics? thanks!
[2:44:09] <%JustToWatch> "When I told you it would be better if your Dad just died, it was because I cared"
[2:44:12] <%doomerskeletor13> This is a running theme of the series. There‚Äôs always at least one guy who is a big scum and the game does a 180 out of nowhere
[2:44:14] <+sunwraith91> Well she was lying about said period
[2:44:16] <%BusterRepukken> Adachi just said he's an asshole
[2:44:25] <drunken_lemur> That is a boss arena
[2:44:28] <+OroOreo> soylent green... is...
[2:44:33] <fIashman92> @doomerskeletor13 This time it's a bit different IMO in how it's handled
[2:44:36] <+meatmaaan> that browser tho
[2:44:37] <$dudedude55555> this entire section is great
[2:44:41] <thaprinnydood> its like its a trope or somethin :)
[2:44:42] <jorniev> LOOKS LIKE SCIENTOLOGY
[2:44:50] <aiutare47> This is a money laundering front right. Why else would you charge that much?
[2:44:50] <fuji_92> yeah adachi and namba know the dude is shit
[2:44:52] <%slimmixrp> I hope they get through this section
[2:44:57] <Darren716> I hope they main line the rest of this chapter and get it done tonight
[2:45:06] <+The_Death_Owl> PSA time
[2:45:07] <Darren716> It'll be a bit of a rush but they should have time
[2:45:08] <%Exiliator> I mean if he was just a regular douche, it wouldn't be much of a story
[2:45:09] <%patriotrenegade> PLEASE BREED -Shinzo Abe

[2:45:16] <aurasviel> Yes Adachi, a large amount of people are old
[2:45:21] <malbarrough> Yeah, Japan has a large elderly population
[2:45:28] <BlackermanZX> doodWat
[2:45:32] <laguerrilha> People taking advantage of elderly are a special kind of scum
[2:45:35] <jorniev> you don't NEED to charge that much to use it for money laundering
[2:45:38] <+The_Death_Owl> Adachi isn't far from the nursing home himself LUL
[2:45:47] <%livlinn> joofbSweat joofbSweat joofbSweat
[2:45:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Adachi is young at heart
[2:45:48] <enerkaizer> yeah, an aging populatioon like Japans comes with this insane cult of work. No time to literally make kids
[2:45:57] <+runegod20> remember, old folks home are businesses first and health care second
[2:45:59] <+archie_ns> And in muscles too, Adachi is a freaking bull
[2:45:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Kappa
[2:46:02] <fIashman92> This game meandors for 8 chapters
[2:46:09] <Deko_> how is this connected to the empty lot?
[2:46:09] <%doomerskeletor13> He started a new main quest
[2:46:15] <BlackermanZX> remember we had a hobo arc
[2:46:17] <jtsoppy137> nah Ichi gotta hero it up
[2:46:33] <+runegod20> we get shot and our first goal is to stop being homeless, we explicitly didn't really have a goal after that

[2:49:06] <CappuccinoGuil> RIGHT?!?!?
[2:49:07] <%BusterRepukken> almost like its a Grey Zone
[2:49:07] <+Hacerous> An asshole with a heart of gold?
[2:49:08] <Tardispardis> Poor writing
[2:49:09] <%Grimlockfly> you're getting more
[2:49:10] <fuji_92> YOU'LL SEE
[2:49:10] <enerkaizer> because this games story is about moral extremes
[2:49:10] <deviljhojho_> they went too hard
[2:49:11] <+The_Death_Owl> like pat say "it goes places"
[2:49:11] <+QueequegTheater> I think it's just a fakeout
[2:49:11] <Deasmeister> I have no idea
[2:49:13] <thaprinnydood> never judge a book by its cover?
[2:49:13] <%jonblnt> red herring
[2:49:13] <%justcallmebobplease> That's actually a good question.
[2:49:14] <ghoststalker> GREY ZONE
[2:49:16] <BlackermanZX> fake out i guess LUL
[2:49:16] <ullyzeez> shonen fake out
[2:49:18] <+ConLin_Arts_> gray zone
[2:49:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Yakuza LOVES this trope
[2:49:19] <%BestTeaMaker> BLEACH THE GREY ZONES
[2:49:19] <teefpal> SUBVERTED YOUR EXPECTATIONS!
[2:49:20] <pmmori> @WoolieVersus maybe it was less gross in the japanese subs? I played in english so I don't know
[2:49:20] <missingangle> They tried too hard to make him sleazy
[2:49:20] <+MagiKestral> they just wanted to take you out
[2:49:20] <redrins> grey zone, dont bleach it Kappa
[2:49:22] <the_angelon_experience> he's A GREY ZONE
[2:49:22] <%MajorCrasher> to make you learn not to judge a book by its cover
[2:49:23] <Spagheddies> I'm guessing it was a mishandling of a bait & Switch.
[2:49:25] <laguerrilha> That people can be both good and bad?
[2:49:26] <fuji_92> grey zone
[2:49:26] <%BusterRepukken> GREY ZONE
[2:49:27] <CappuccinoGuil> It was a BAD fakeout
[2:49:28] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Fake out for the help of it
[2:49:28] <RyuShinden> Just heavy subversion
[2:49:31] <%PKSomething> Grey zone
[2:49:32] <sandwichpeddler> Literally Grey Zone
[2:49:32] <+Zanzibar_Junker> hell of it
[2:49:33] <+Mr_Pylon> Morally grey zone
[2:49:33] <+vixenpunch> G R E Y Z O N E
[2:49:33] <linSP> bait and switch writing
[2:49:36] <mrdejesus34> Yokoyama got better.
[2:49:37] <%r0chelimit> My guess is someone on the staff is trying to excuse they‚Äôre toxic behavior
[2:49:37] <%MajorCrasher> Also yeah gray zone
[2:49:39] <+The_Death_Owl> thematic grey zone
[2:49:39] <%akuda_bar> script is making a shitty point about how being an asshole is fine
[2:49:40] <+paladinstarbuster> poorly written fake out
[2:49:42] <PsychoPearl> the good and bad in people?
[2:49:42] <+projectmanatees> maybe show ichibans emotional maturity in understanding things?
[2:49:43] <BlackermanZX> crime drama
[2:49:43] <Afroperonista> yeah, maybe shut up and keep playing LUL
[2:49:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They went too hard
[2:49:47] <%Exiliator> Yes. Huge fakeout! The problem is that you ate it all up immediately!
[2:49:50] <%doomerskeletor13> The series just loves the trope of ‚Äúscumbag is secretly good‚Äù
[2:49:52] <Deasmeister> Badly done fakeout I think
[2:49:52] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Definitely more to find out
[2:49:52] <ghoststalker> TAXI TAXI
[2:49:54] <laguerrilha> Thematic grey zone yeah
[2:49:55] <+Ancopro> just to make a bad first impression so when kasuga sees through it its like whoaaa
[2:50:01] <+archie_ns> People that sound like assholes can still care about other people, while other people sound pleasent but dont care about others
[2:50:03] <@Solidus_113> J Drama plot
[2:50:03] <+Hacerous> maybe playing to the "Service Manager" stereotype ?
[2:50:04] <linSP> maybe everything isn‚Äôt so black and white
[2:50:07] <eldragon_1> It's an Endeavor situation. Writer went to hard at beginning
[2:50:08] <%sirisvirus> ya I think its a bad fake out
[2:50:11] <CappuccinoGuil> If you ignore that 1st scene, Nonomiya's character is so much better
[2:50:12] <Hopit> @WoolieVersus I take it as showing even "assholes" can be good people
[2:50:13] <thatotherguynikolas> Because Yakuza is a serious crime drama
[2:50:13] <Malikwest11> I just got it but it‚Äôs for later
[2:50:14] <+ultimafullmetal> To show that I Ichiban can see right through him
[2:50:14] <teefpal> he's not a good guy
[2:50:15] <%BusterRepukken> some people need to take their rorschach goggles off
[2:50:15] <+MightyDuckShoes> he's supposed to portray the assumed stereotype at first
[2:50:16] <%akuda_bar> Ha Ha I Was Just Pretending To Be An Asshole
[2:50:23] <deviljhojho_> MERELY PRETENDING
[2:50:26] <jtsoppy137> wooo boys bar
[2:50:28] <teefpal> but he's not pure evil
[2:50:29] <%doomerskeletor13> TransgenderPride
[2:50:30] <+dustiler> btw theres another dude
[2:50:32] <Jp_DrZaius> Maybe to opose ichiban
[2:50:33] <enerkaizer> nanba meanwhile learning to fly LUL
[2:50:33] <+Hacerous> yes
[2:50:34] <Sulfur_Boride> Remember when Nonomiya said it'd be better off for Nanoha if her dad just died? yeeeaaahhhhh...
[2:50:34] <fIashman92> MINIBOSS
[2:50:34] <eiyuusyndrome> all j dramas are like this

[2:50:41] <+0neReeler> good business man?
[2:50:42] <Seraphim9> they're perfect for each other
[2:50:42] <%doomerskeletor13> You can do it! TransgenderPride
[2:50:43] <%dreadedcthulhu> *egg cracks*
[2:50:43] <+Mendin> Hell yeah!
[2:50:44] <zanzibarian_hamster> Why are you so mad that a character is written multi-faceted? A guy can be both a dick and a decent guy
[2:50:48] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> woolieYE
[2:50:50] <teefpal> TransgenderPride
[2:50:51] <ZaverVT> Have they done DRAGON KART yet?
[2:50:54] <+dustiler> that says the other thing swear it is a imi no wa sit
[2:50:55] <Tardispardis> IT WAS MERELY AN ACT
[2:50:57] <williejames> i saw it as set up for ichiban immediately knowing how to fix up a soapland
[2:51:01] <teefpal> Just swap parts
[2:51:01] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> PrideWave
[2:51:03] <williejames> but it comes on way too strong
[2:51:04] <%akuda_bar> @zanzibarian_hamster he does not register as a decent guy after that, just two faced
[2:51:05] <%BusterRepukken> @zanzibarian_hamster no we can only have black or white alignments
[2:51:05] <laguerrilha> They should run hard into each other so they change bodies
[2:51:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Zaver88 not yet, hope they do tho
[2:51:12] <%doomerskeletor13> They are dense maps
[2:51:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH GOD UP THAT STREET
[2:51:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @zanzibarian_hamster "I suppose it'd be best if your dad just died!" to "please, help her and her father!" is a MASSIVE jump, my guy
[2:51:22] <%baka_sugoi> condense map
[2:51:27] <Dante_Namikaze1> @zaver88 now not yet
[2:51:30] <dandragon01> The whole theme may be Gray Zones and Gray Morality, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that some things this game does aren‚Äôt done poorly
[2:51:32] <thaprinnydood> wide linear
[2:51:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO GO BACK UP THAT STREET
[2:51:37] <plaguedoctor_syan> @WoolieVersus Maybe since the previous screen was about the good side of sex industry they did that no to always be good stuff?

[2:57:30] <jcflyguy> Janitors rule
[2:57:39] <DedlokPM> @T_Sasquatch They alternate between Japanese and English every week
[2:57:41] <+paladinstarbuster> He did it but he diidnt like it
[2:57:42] <drunken_lemur> But he was doing it with Nanba, so...
[2:57:42] <sperium3000> How can you say "Ichiban is not the type"? Youre playing the game RIGHT NOW
[2:57:45] <Knight_Lautrec> i think hes less bothered by the job and more bothered hes the only one doing it
[2:57:46] <ManaSpurt> Cum and shit are way two different things.lmao
[2:57:47] <exnuart> yea but they got the cool jobs
[2:57:49] <twoto858> Less complaining about the job, more complaining about the boss
[2:57:52] <DSD24> He's probably frustrated at the no new info
[2:57:56] <%doomerskeletor13> One of his firsts quests in this game is to get a plunger for the soap land
[2:57:58] <+runegod20> and also by how tough his boss is
[2:58:00] <T_Sasquatch> @doomerskeletor13 @DedlokPM thanks NotLikeThis
[2:58:02] <+zzNamttamzz> He's jealous they got cool outfits KasugaYeah
[2:58:05] <deviljhojho_> how are cum and shit different they both come out from the same place
[2:58:05] <Tardispardis> we would've missed out on some top tier Engrish hijinks if they had gone dub
[2:58:08] <sperium3000> Imagine if you were doing something and someone told you "Woolie isn't the type to do that"
[2:58:10] <+MightyDuckShoes> be literally had to get a plunger for his first quest
[2:58:23] <Sulfur_Boride> Ichiban's the Dragon of Rockbottom. That's the actual nickname they've given him
[2:58:23] <Ultimatefool> @deviljhojho_ The Woolie hole?
[2:58:28] <Ner234> @deviljhojho_ ???
[2:58:29] <+dustiler> @deviljhojho_ Wha
[2:58:32] <Crippl3> @deviljhojho_ pieS
[2:58:32] <ullyzeez> dammit the english scenes here are sooko good
[2:58:33] <deviljhojho_> @Ultimatefool The Beyond
[2:58:38] <%TheMoenia> @deviljhojho_ if shit is coming out of your dick, you have a problem
[2:58:47] <+runegod20> wouldn't they in theory be making money from this temp work unless they finish their main job and quit before payday?
[2:58:51] <StebTheVee> Fun fact: In the English dub, the cleaning lady's VA is the wife of Ichiban's VA
[2:58:52] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, they aren't even on the clock at the soapland, so the guy isn't paying anything
[2:58:57] <+Mr_Pylon> yeah they'd be getting paid for this
[2:59:00] <deviljhojho_> @TheMoenia Hmmm, its been a while since my last checkup i guess tomatoMMM
[2:59:01] <%doomerskeletor13> This whole chapter feels like something from Judgment
[2:59:05] <+MightyDuckShoes> @sperium3000 it's a writing inconsistency., potentially. I think it has more to do with him being in a lower position than the others
[2:59:12] <big_laser_boss> It's about their well being
[2:59:15] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ghoststalker
[2:59:24] <sperium3000> @MightyDuckShoes Nah, don't buy that.
[2:59:25] <deviljhojho_> Excellent
[2:59:28] <%RadicalWeegee> you would be surprised
[2:59:30] <+DukeofJahan> have you chosen wether to stay on dub or sub? its easier to follow the story on dub personally

[3:00:10] <Sulfur_Boride> Fun fact: Ichiban's dub actor plays Lee Chaolan's alter ego that speaks English, Violet, in Tekken Tag 2

[3:28:35] <%justcallmebobplease> Please look at bottles on wall behind bar.
[3:28:38] <Nekros4442> @schrodingers_box stfu
[3:28:38] <%superc37> ichiban wouldnt even know wtf a piano is
[3:28:40] <+Bailey__gaming> play moonlight sinata to unlock a secret
[3:28:40] <MyNameIsRasus> oh my god chat shut up

[3:29:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Naw if your playing you gotta close that lid
[3:29:10] <@Menitta> Its so cool but not practical in the slightest
[3:29:10] <jtsoppy137> the barkeep would kill them
[3:29:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it is a nice piano
[3:29:33] <+runegod20> i imagine the price of a piano is 50% the outside shell, and 50% all the guts and internals, so getting just the shell without it working wouldp roably be way cheap
[3:29:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:46:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 99%
[3:46:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> Justice probably
[3:46:21] <olaksi> They are all Tower arcana
[3:46:22] <%BlueJoneleth> Hierophnt?
[3:46:23] <Deko_> thats the guy from the beggining right?
[3:46:23] <$thespacerunaway> @Darren716 Justice or Chariot
[3:46:24] <+mental_mashup> @themoenia Your life has more value than that homie
[3:46:26] <penitentpendant> @Darren716 Jester/Hunger
[3:46:29] <jorniev> is adachi the justice arcana?
[3:46:30] <+Liquid_Dio> Strength or Heirophant I think
[3:46:30] <Spagheddies> @Darren716 Either Justice or Hierophant.
[3:46:36] <%BlueJoneleth> Ichi's clearly The Fool XD
[3:46:40] <%Daskolin> Remember 90% CONVICTION rate in Japan
[3:46:49] <Darren716> Ichi has to be Fool or Jester, Adachi i'd put Chariot or Justice

[3:46:51] <ABakedDemon> Except for one passed out guy lol

[3:47:03] <Darren716> Or Magician
[3:47:08] <DSD24> Nanba is Magician
[3:47:09] <jtsoppy137> Namba is hermit
[3:47:17] <DSD24> Nah actually hermit fits better
[3:47:18] <ghoststalker> Yeah, Nanba would be Magician
[3:47:18] <NorthGrizzly> ADAICHI IS A MAN'S MAN
[3:47:19] <Darren716> Nah people later on are better hermits
[3:47:31] <Spagheddies> Nanba would technically be the Priestess. Explaining why would be spoilers.

[4:08:34] <%cache_22> This karaoke is too real.
[4:08:34] <Karego_at> japanese is INCREDIBLE
[4:08:35] <@Menitta> Adachi's VA did say he wanted to record it again better

[4:08:40] <dmtjinni> L
[4:08:40] <%doomerskeletor13> They cast the dub in mind for the dialogue, not the karaoke
[4:08:40] <Jediforce317> But that's the point tho
[4:08:41] <+Jaromero435> Ichiaban's is bad and its amazing
[4:08:42] <rafflespaddock> oh god no
[4:08:42] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Apparently the VA was told it‚Äôs be funny to sing in this boy band voice instead of his gruff Adachi voice
[4:08:42] <%jonblnt> Better
[4:08:42] <PsychoPearl> try Japanese to compare
[4:08:43] <DSD24> POSE
[4:08:43] <+CookieCutter007> LUL Goku's voice actor
[4:08:43] <%Exiliator> Thank I hate it
[4:08:45] <enerkaizer> The translated versions are all big winners
[4:08:45] <Sulfur_Boride> So Adachi's dub actor clarified that he originally wanted to sing in a voice more in line with his Adachi voice, but the dub team thought Adachi singing in a young sounding voice was too funny to pass up.
[4:08:45] <hassanico2> The finish is way weake
[4:08:46] <aurasviel> FALL IN LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE
[4:08:46] <Karego_at> they better do the og next

[4:11:13] <%livlinn> enough for karaoke
[4:11:14] <convo445> english songs are impressive but it is what it is
[4:11:14] <TamsynRRD> I like teasing sub purists about not watching things like ATLA or Looney Tunes in japanese.
[4:11:14] <Crippl3> English Baka Mitai is GOOD, it's GOOD damn you
[4:11:14] <%superc37> i unironically love how terrible the singing is in the dub
[4:11:15] <%nicversus> The karaoke is so real
[4:11:15] <fuji_92> the translations are bad either
[4:11:16] <hookhis> is Woolie really just playing 13 hours or is it until a certain chapter or thing?
[4:11:18] <mortificent> Robbie Raymond goes hard
[4:11:20] <laguerrilha> they tried
[4:11:21] <%superc37> its so good
[4:11:21] <+JustBlubs> An issues I may have had with it is absolved by the fact that it's just them trying their best at Karaoke
[4:11:21] <%doomerskeletor13> The Localization team is amazing
[4:11:24] <cumurasame> Oh right Spring Breeze is pretty good
[4:11:24] <+Koover> I respect the effort
[4:11:25] <OffsideGinger5> sucks they didn't hear the good versions
[4:11:25] <fuji_92> aren't bad I mean
[4:11:26] <thatotherguynikolas> They tried REALLY HARD
[4:11:26] <+paladinstarbuster> Why do they feel gross its kareoke
[4:11:27] <Karego_at> just please let us hear the beauty of machine gun in japanese
[4:11:28] <BabblingBayou> Yeah, they tried their best

[4:11:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> V WITH THE RIGHT
[4:11:34] <%patriotrenegade> DU
[4:11:35] <%sjay662> Kaiji Tang sucks at singing, it's the best
[4:11:35] <Second_Omega> I adore how bad Ichiban‚Äôs is
[4:11:36] <amritadyne> TRUE
[4:11:37] <%patriotrenegade> DU HAST
[4:11:39] <+krispen_wa> I AGREE WITH V!?
[4:11:39] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Ichiban's English VA can't sing for shit. It's AMAZING.
[4:11:41] <Xelhesia> DU HAST
[4:11:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:11:41] <Tham1k> oh boy
[4:11:42] <enerkaizer> you wouldn't sing rammstein period because they suck, and I say that as a German LUL LUL LUL
[4:11:43] <NorthGrizzly> Check
[4:11:43] <+shad8snake> V IS 100% RIGHT
[4:11:44] <twohitgood> rammstein has songs in english
[4:11:45] <missingangle> I love how they're not great, tbh. It's part of the karaoke charm
[4:11:46] <exnuart> not with that attitude
[4:11:47] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Didn‚Äôt even get to hear Ichiban‚Äôs song at all BibleThump
[4:11:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> V IS RIGHT THO
[4:11:49] <+meprocrastinate> it's better cause they're not supposed to be good
[4:11:49] <%nicversus> YOU.... YOU HATE.... YOU HATE ME
[4:11:51] <%Exiliator> You.. You have... You have me LUL
[4:11:57] <wibbwobbler> dub everything
[4:11:58] <$Rumbutt> V you're just DARING somebody to do english Rammstein covers now
[4:12:00] <Ids560> I think bad translations enhances the art Kappa
[4:12:01] <%TheMoenia> enough to sing
[4:12:01] <+shootbang_exe> JP machine gun kiss is great and now I'm bitter
[4:12:01] <+JustBlubs> ENOUGH FOR THE LAST SONG
[4:12:02] <+GimmMeASammich> taxi, or 2 songs
[4:12:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Ramstein literally has songs in English
[4:12:04] <Mattais88> 99 Red Balloons is also terrible
[4:12:07] <$Rumbutt> somebody WILL do it
[4:12:10] <laguerrilha> 300 per fight for now it seems
[4:12:10] <Second_Omega> What do you mean, ichiban is singing in Japanese
[4:12:11] <PsychoPearl> Not even gonna do Ichiban's song?
[4:12:13] <Karego_at> you missed the best song??
[4:12:14] <resloxxx> OR 2 more JP songs
[4:12:15] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @majindusto
[4:12:15] <ken_dynamek> Dub the water effects
[4:12:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 99 Luftbaloons or bust
[4:12:19] <penitentpendant> Gotta earn more karaoke money
[4:12:24] <CappuccinoGuil> V is wrong because this is localization question. He's right on Rammstein, though.
[4:12:27] <aurasviel> Nanba just ran a city block to kick that guy's ass
[4:12:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Rammstein songs already have english versions, mistranslated but still
[4:12:33] <missingangle> Look at that. Enough for two songs
[4:12:37] <thatotherguynikolas> you know what else that's enough for? that's right! more Karaoke..
[4:12:41] <+fritadobravado> Guys there‚Äôs just one more song

[4:12:58] <+runegod20> pocket watch and a cop taking bribes
[4:12:59] <+fritadobravado> We have enough for a song and a ride
[4:13:00] <teefpal> There's one more song and its amazing
[4:13:04] <thatotherguynikolas> To singlehandedly keep that bar afloat
[4:13:04] <Karego_at> im BEGGING go back and sing machine gun in japanese
[4:13:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pocketing Watchman - A police man on the take
[4:13:09] <Second_Omega> Oh cool look at all that kareoke money
[4:13:10] <Mattais88> I need to do Kareoke and you look like just enough for two songs
[4:13:10] <%Nested_Dreams> Cyberpunk is not an RPG :v
[4:13:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Itll continue to be great until the end
[4:13:20] <+Koover> I'll even listen to it when driving sometimes
[4:13:21] <TheMoenia> give us ichis song
[4:13:23] <NorthGrizzly> Yakuza 3 is Better than Cyberpunk
[4:13:24] <+Liquid_Dio> BABY BABY BABY YEEEEEEEAAAAH

[4:34:19] <+Koover> Pick your preference
[4:34:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> both good
[4:34:22] <missingangle> Dub is shockingly good

[4:34:27] <HiddenDM> Both are strong.
[4:34:29] <fuji_92> Dub is amazing
[4:34:30] <madtrixr> its wild how they actually hit it for the dub
[4:34:31] <penitentpendant> @thatotherguynikolas Bonus points if one of them is Woolie's
[4:34:33] <+JustBlubs> V's gonna play dub but switch back to sub for karaoke
[4:34:33] <%akuda_bar> if you do both... is it bubbed
[4:34:33] <BlackermanZX> both are damn good
[4:34:34] <+Ancopro> LUL

[4:34:39] <jorniev> DAVID HAYTER IS IN THIS
[4:34:45] <%gatorafan> So when's Judgement? Kappa
[4:34:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Kaiji Tang is the biggest sell in English
[4:34:48] <Darren716> He does!
[4:34:48] <wibbwobbler> sub is pretty goood
[4:34:50] <+shootbang_exe> GARY BUSTER HOLMES

[4:34:53] <MagumaDono> They're GREAT in English lmao
[4:34:54] <+Liquid_Dio> Foreigner
[4:34:57] <%Exiliator> Dub is good, but way overhyped
[4:34:58] <PsychoPearl> Gary Buster Holmes
[4:34:58] <ghoststalker> OH NICE JOKE
[4:34:59] <majindusto> No Machinegun Kiss in Japanese BibleThump
[4:34:59] <%Afterman_> and NERO
[4:35:00] <+McSoliace> nah there all good
[4:35:02] <Mahbonk> english karaoke is decent enough. Personally just not a fan of english Machine Gun kiss. Otherwise dub is very good
[4:35:02] <MagumaDono> Nick Ogata is FANTASTIC in English
[4:35:02] <Deko_> best of both worlds
[4:35:02] <laguerrilha> Nick is hyper Dandy in eng
[4:35:08] <missingangle> The whole English guy part in the dub is still funny, but man it's hilarious in the sub
[4:35:15] <%Afterman_> There is a BUNCH of 13 sentinels VAs
[4:35:19] <Tardispardis> @MagumaDono Better in Sub tho
[4:35:22] <Darren716> Exiliator It deservers to be hyped since people can be so adverse to it
[4:35:24] <jorniev> AND PROZD
[4:35:29] <MagumaDono> @Tardispardis To each their own :P
[4:35:32] <+loukemia83> Nick works pretty great in English
[4:35:32] <Darren716> You gotta get over that barrier to show how good it is
[4:35:33] <ghoststalker> Need to go back to see Gary Buster Holmes now
[4:35:34] <Gufferd> Will Judgement (Judge Eyes) by on the list?
[4:35:35] <su6human> man can't wait to go back to hearing Ichiban's japanese voice coming out Nishiki's mouth again and neither Woolie nor V being able to connect the dots
[4:35:36] <fIashman92> No monkey roomba for us

[4:36:13] <+Mr_Pylon> you'll see
[4:36:13] <Darren716> Play they all simultaneously
[4:36:18] <NorthGrizzly> He is Japanese Irish
[4:36:20] <+Jiggisnipe> see how hype V was for Gary Buster Holmes and Woolie was like who is this? That's why he should play the other games
[4:36:21] <@Menitta> Woolie has seen the edges of the franchise
[4:36:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i have a strong suspicion he'll do kiwami after 0 but we'll see
[4:36:23] <MagumaDono> JJs
[4:36:23] <%Javaa01> If Majima killed Kiryu, then NOTHING could quench his thirst for battle
[4:36:23] <%hax_metatron> Yeah okay we get it Woolie
[4:36:27] <Mahbonk> Clap
[4:36:27] <kevonthelordofslimes> *Clap*
[4:36:29] <plaguedoctor_syan> he wants to fuck-fight kiryu
[4:36:29] <+Mendin> They're mentioned in Y0 in relation to Majima at the start yeah
[4:36:30] <%jonblnt> four more years of yakuza games
[4:36:34] <HollowMan190> don't worry Neither dise Pat
[4:36:40] <jorniev> IS FOR THE BEST stuff hits harder in later chapters if you play all the other games
[4:36:40] <HollowMan190> dose
[4:36:43] <Ids560> glad you had fun with 7
[4:36:49] <%Exiliator> üëè üëè üëè
[4:36:51] <+shootbang_exe> I want a V cover of Machine Gun Kiss in japanese
[4:36:52] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah some shaky morals
[4:36:53] <majindusto> FINISH 4-5-6 FIRST!!! V
[4:36:57] <jtsoppy137> public pisser sub quest
[4:37:14] <Mattais88> Because Ichi is outgoing
[4:37:14] <Louie_Salmon> Ichiban is so much more of a helper than Kiryu too
[4:37:17] <+Koover> even this nutso guy things this is crazy
[4:37:17] <fIashman92> They made them crazier
[4:37:19] <madtrixr> yes, it works so much better
[4:37:27] <@Menitta> 7's tone is probably much more consistent compared to the rest of the series
[4:37:29] <Darren716> You'd believe that Ichi would want to do sub stories
[4:37:29] <Mahbonk> Kiryu has a much different approach than Ichiban
[4:37:38] <+Ancopro> kiryu would not drink the milk
[4:37:38] <+shootbang_exe> oh it gets wild
[4:37:39] <Louie_Salmon> Kiryu would absolutely never help random people, it's just a game mechanic
[4:37:51] <majindusto> GARY BUSTER HOLMES
[4:37:52] <Tardispardis> WHAT
[4:37:53] <+shootbang_exe> would kiryu drink the milk
[4:38:01] <jorniev> alls well that ends well next to a chimp and a bunch of fire in the background
[4:38:04] <+Fabpsi_> and lets not forget the grown baby-man!
[4:38:05] <reonome> kiryu would drink the milk if offered
[4:38:09] <Mahbonk> Yokohama is great PogChamp
[4:38:09] <fIashman92> Kiryu would absolutely drink the milk
[4:38:12] <+Mr_Pylon> Yakuza just gets better with every itteration, and I'd put Judgement just below 7
[4:38:12] <%Seancicle> gonna jet. c u
[4:38:19] <%jonblnt> show some love for Kiryu-chan woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[4:38:23] <Indigo_Automaton> Kiryu is too polite to turn it down
[4:38:29] <@Menitta> Yeah Yakuza has always had that problem with it's map. Just adding a walking around and taxi finding for fast travel really helped it in that aspect
[4:38:34] <Sulfur_Boride> 5
[4:38:34] <Mahbonk> 5 and Kiwami 1
[4:38:35] <Darren716> 4 and 5?

[4:38:38] <+Mr_Pylon> After 5
[4:38:39] <jtsoppy137> 5
[4:38:39] <fIashman92> 5 and 6
[4:38:41] <%BlueJoneleth> 5
[4:38:42] <big_laser_boss> Before 6
[4:38:43] <rafflespaddock> after 5 before kiwami
[4:38:43] <Mattais88> 5&6
[4:38:44] <%Lion_kun> 5
[4:38:45] <+Koover> I watched those walking around kabuchiko videos on foot, I had to take a double take when I knew ahead of time the don Quixote was up ahead
[4:38:46] <Mahbonk> i mean in between 5 and Kiwami 1
[4:38:49] <hassanico2> 0 is second to last Kiryu game
[4:38:52] <@Menitta> Kiwami 2 was after 6
[4:38:53] <Sapphire_Breeze> 6 is before kiwami 2
[4:38:54] <+Mr_Pylon> And Judgement
[4:38:55] <+Jiggisnipe> 5 0 K1 6 K2
[4:38:56] <ghoststalker> After 5, before 6, yeah
[4:38:56] <%Irridium> 5, 0, 6, Kiwami 2
[4:38:57] <+Ancopro> kiwami 2 is after 6
[4:39:00] <Darren716> Judgement is also on this engine
[4:39:05] <+condemned_15> 6, Judgement, then Kiwami2
[4:39:07] <+OblivionSword1> 6 is the first game with the new engine
[4:39:07] <majindusto> 6 CAME BEFORE KIWAMI 2
[4:39:08] <@Menitta> and ishin but we arent allowed to have that
[4:39:08] <Deko_> and kiwami 1
[4:39:09] <Tracazoid> Kiwami 2, 6, Judgment and 7 are the Dragon Engine games
[4:39:11] <Xelhesia> 5 0 K1 6 K2 7
[4:39:12] <Mahbonk> i agree with V
[4:39:12] <jorniev> man im so happy for yakuza fans, they really got a bunch of cool stuff for their patience
[4:39:14] <%BlueJoneleth> 5 is great too
[4:39:28] <T_Sasquatch> 2 feels like an arcade game
[4:39:31] <+CookieCutter007> 5 goes BRRRRR
[4:39:34] <big_laser_boss> 0 is the best of that engiene. Especially with the Quick-change clothes
[4:39:34] <Darren716> 5 is on par with 0
[4:39:34] <+SunnyVarietyPack> 5 is just a direct sequel to 4
[4:39:34] <%Irridium> 5's real good
[4:39:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> 3 is more jank than good but it's still worth experiencing
[4:39:37] <@Menitta> 5 is insane
[4:39:38] <madtrixr> 5 is an endurance run
[4:39:39] <jtsoppy137> 5 do you like baseball
[4:39:39] <+condemned_15> 5 has A LOT of side content
[4:39:39] <%TheMoenia> i am playing 3 currently it is very playable
[4:39:40] <rafflespaddock> 5 is reeeally ood
[4:39:42] <+OblivionSword1> 5 is a big game
[4:39:45] <fIashman92> 5 is a buffet you're forced to eat all of
[4:39:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:39:46] <PsychoPearl> 5 is long
[4:39:48] <+Stormiercashew> 3 isnt that bad
[4:39:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 5 is 3 and 4 combined long
[4:39:53] <linSP> very playable doesn‚Äôt sound like a compliment
[4:39:54] <majindusto> PLAY THEM ALL
[4:39:58] <Mahbonk> im personally mixed about 5. But that really depends on people. Otherwise i really enjoyed my ride with the whole series
[4:40:01] <@Menitta> Dunkaccino
[4:40:03] <putnampuppeteer> !uptime
[4:40:03] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 56 minutes
[4:40:12] <%PKSomething> It came out too later
[4:40:12] <Darren716> it won nothing
[4:40:14] <%Irridium> sure did, just like 13 Sentinels
[4:40:14] <+Koover> I've been playing through 3, you can feel its a ps3 game
[4:40:14] <@Menitta> It was nominated for best RPG and lost to FF7R
[4:40:15] <T_Sasquatch> 5 has the most stuff in any yakuza game
[4:40:18] <+Koover> Also no running :(
[4:40:20] <CappuccinoGuil> No awards
[4:40:20] <Jukseri> I feel 5 tries to fit in too many characters and stories into it
[4:40:22] <wibbwobbler> for sure
[4:40:22] <fIashman92> It was never going to beat FFVII :(
[4:40:23] <+Stormiercashew> it got nominated tho which is pretty good
[4:40:26] <$drabberfaun535> the last of us 2 stole their spot
[4:40:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> KIRYU COMING IN FORTNITE
[4:40:29] <Mahbonk> LUL
[4:40:30] <Tardispardis> Still very much a niche series
[4:40:30] <+Jiggisnipe> surprised that people still care about awards
[4:40:33] <dan_g_v> Pat made them popular
[4:40:34] <PsychoPearl> true
[4:40:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Yakuza 7 and 13 Sentinels got NOTHING
[4:40:36] <majindusto> The Fist of the North Star Yakuza game is GREAT TOO
[4:40:37] <+loukemia83> it really did, fuck Last of Us 2
[4:40:41] <xdeathknightx> By the power of Pat
[4:40:44] <@Menitta> I could rant for hours about the problems with the Game Awards
[4:40:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I WISH THAT WAS STILL THE CASE
[4:40:48] <emmmdeekay> It lost NARRATIVE
[4:40:50] <ghoststalker> FUCKING FORK KNIFE
[4:40:55] <madtrixr> god tga just being a tlou2 jerk session was
[4:40:57] <Tracazoid> Wasn't there a point where people feared Yakuza wouldn't even be localized? They've had a rough run at times.
[4:40:57] <%gatorafan> Fortnite didn't win any award either, checkmate Kappa
[4:41:00] <Darren716> It lost narrative to fucking last of us 2
[4:41:00] <huskarl_zap> res, but not loot lake, I would love to, chug jug with you, we can be pro fortnite gamers
[4:41:04] <Darren716> And RPG to FF7R
[4:41:05] <madtrixr> i knew thats how it was gonna be but it was still depressing
[4:41:05] <thatotherguynikolas> Game awards went full on Oscars
[4:41:06] <@Menitta> The fact that this wasn't nominated for narrative is insane
[4:41:08] <Qu1ckyyy> 13S lost against fucking TLoU2...
[4:41:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli IT IS FOR US
[4:41:12] <+Koover> is that name an ace combat reference?
