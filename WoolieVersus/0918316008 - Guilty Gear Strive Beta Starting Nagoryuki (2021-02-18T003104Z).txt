[0:07:21] <QueequegTheater> cheer500 Hey Woolie, loving the Yakuza 0 LP. Just so you're aware, Beast Style is actually primarily a charge style. You can hold the buttons for every attack in a combo, and any attack after the first one gets massive hyper armor. Doing this will more than double Beast's damage output.

[0:15:48] <leith_aziz> RAP
[0:15:49] <primaryfire> octopimp wants to know your location
[0:15:49] <%kyh9> BLEACH MORE THAN SAMSHO

[0:15:55] <%kyh9> GETSUGA TENSHO
[0:15:57] <%kyh9> MOTHERFUCKER
[0:15:57] <metaphase72> His dash is a special command

[0:16:08] <jetjagger222> lmao samsho hitstop
[0:16:11] <+Gamingand808s> how is he in beta already
[0:16:11] <Umbrus> @dianatheascian It's similar to a Beatles song.
[0:16:12] <+RealPT1> looks meaty as hell
[0:16:17] <Darlos9D> now its time to feast
[0:16:17] <andre11dr> So that blood meter is what you want to pay attention to
[0:16:18] <%HeroToxiko> SourPls
[0:16:23] <+GenesisKnight> Opposite

[0:16:31] <Testaterone> try this combo: 5k xxx 214h 2d 5h xx 236k 236s
[0:16:33] <Toni_Master43> it's hunger meter
[0:16:33] <xeros720> then you gotta let it out
[0:16:37] <%X2Eliah> Woolie are you wrong?
[0:16:38] <halcyon_animatic> the giant buddha statue rocket things in the background are wild
[0:16:38] <%Eaglestrike117> Its hunger meter woolie
[0:16:40] <MyNameIsRasus> ISS BLOOOOOOOOOOD
[0:16:40] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Nope, it's the other way around
[0:16:41] <Vaunno> its thirst meter
[0:16:41] <Darren716> Are songs stage or character specific?
[0:16:44] <LoneFonte> @Gamingand808s content creators got a code for a day early
[0:16:47] <+Itselguapo> Fuckin' dark knights
[0:16:48] <+ArsCaelia> i just remembered what this song reminded of: come together
[0:16:50] <DedlokPM> @Afroperonista I like it. Also it is a LOT better than the early ui they showed
[0:16:50] <%Noonoox12> yo this song
[0:16:51] <Finaldragoon> so it's a reverse food gauge from Sin?
[0:16:53] <spawnzie> WASS THAT SMELL
[0:16:55] <+walt_chocolate> @afroperonista yeah I don't like it ethier
[0:16:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:17:21] <devilrnaycry> devilrnaycry is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 5 in the channel!
[0:17:22] <devilrnaycry> devilrnaycry gifted a Tier 1 sub to ZComiX!

[0:17:22] <devilrnaycry> devilrnaycry gifted a Tier 1 sub to benjisonfire!
[0:17:23] <devilrnaycry> devilrnaycry gifted a Tier 1 sub to SoushinSen!
[0:17:27] <sir_nack> i love the command list giving you snippets of how to use the attack well
[0:17:33] <primaryfire> normals on block or hit will reduce blood gauge, when it fills the mask goes off
[0:17:36] <leith_aziz> I'm fine with UI but combo counter NEEDS to be smaller
[0:17:42] <+walt_chocolate> angbatCHAMP
[0:17:42] <velgaduere> @devilrnaycry holy shit, Minh lucking out deerPogoChamp
[0:17:43] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[0:17:44] <halowedy> i wish all fighting games had the sound on the combo panel so you know the rythm of the combo
[0:17:46] <spawnzie> it's kinda confusing to explain that you absorb blood to EMPTY and not fill your meter
[0:17:49] <leith_aziz> The command list is fantastic in helping
[0:17:49] <Vaunno> combo counter ISNT BIG ENOUGH
[0:17:56] <Darlos9D> god I can't wait to blud rage and just press buttons
[0:18:01] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[0:18:04] <leith_aziz> THIS is how you make a move list
[0:18:05] <Picia000123> Blood Rage is apparently something you do NOT want to trigger
[0:18:07] <+RealPT1> why does he get the good gamma blade?
[0:18:10] <devilrnaycry> thanks for all you videos @WoolieVersus Guilty Gear hypeeee <3
[0:18:15] <BlackermanZX> its kinda like a reverse sin

[0:18:23] <Vaunno> blood rage has a hitbox tbf
[0:18:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @leith_aziz Thank GBVS for this
[0:18:23] <+azraith> BR feels like a punishment for too many meaty specials
[0:18:24] <Finaldragoon> yeah he really seems like Sin + Slayer
[0:18:24] <jetjagger222> shades of ukyo close C
[0:18:24] <+mechslayer71> They gonna do anything about the yuck ass UI?
[0:18:27] <MOON__MIST> is there an option to change notations to PKSH instead of PS buttons?
[0:18:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah this is the anti-sin, where with Sin you want your gauge up, with Nago you want your gauge low
[0:18:29] <velgaduere> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ at last... a paycheck
[0:18:30] <MyNameIsRasus> I like the descriptors on the moves
[0:18:36] <Vaunno> fuuukyoooo
[0:18:39] <+b_aleph> Is Nago related to Slayer?
[0:18:39] <Karhax> closer to Hakumen than Sin
[0:18:39] <halfmasks> dang the music is going in
[0:18:41] <DevinMayCry> I mean, you do crazy shit in blood rage you just need to pay attention and deal with it cause you have a big opening when you go into it I belive
[0:18:42] <%kyh9> For when you just NEED to get in there

[0:19:00] <BoxNavy> thats a good ky skin
[0:19:01] <DevinMayCry> I like his blade flipping 180 degrees often

[0:26:10] <leith_aziz> Okay then
[0:26:15] <jetjagger222> yo that's like antiair tamtam jump C
[0:26:16] <ullyzeez> bro its super slow
[0:26:18] <Applecannon63> Special to Special Cancels baby
[0:26:20] <+smevvster> That AA is givin me strong Vaseraga vibes
[0:26:23] <+ArsCaelia> is soundtrack out yet?
[0:26:26] <inkthepeasant> idk how that would be for crossups tho
[0:26:27] <DamnJP> is it fast enough tho?
[0:26:31] <zer0enixx> @mechslayer71 Look up your stick and see if it‚Äôs compatible
[0:26:31] <th3_gaming_dumb> def test his berserk moves
[0:26:31] <Toni_Master43> A lot of people were saying that jumping seemed strong in this game
[0:26:32] <Vaunno> @mechslayer71 greatly depends on your stick, if it's ps4 you could prob get it working
[0:26:35] <Umbrus> What about 6P?
[0:26:37] <Applecannon63> DAT KICK
[0:26:37] <%Holycow8498> I do have a PS4 so i could get it on that

[0:27:06] <solidoutlaw> woolie can you change the button notations to be the actual normal strength instead of PS buttons?
[0:27:09] <TrashLeviathan> is fast RC only for red RC
[0:27:10] <th3_gaming_dumb> btw the downward Slash is An otg hitting move
[0:27:13] <%fozzle_> the double bass drum in this part is godlike
[0:27:17] <xeros720> maybe just the blade combo?
[0:27:17] <%LastHazzerd> going off what i've seen of Gio, there's gonna be a lot of nuance and fine tuned timing for getting combos down. lots to lab for this game despite being simplified
[0:27:19] <Zoggere> Fast rc is for any rc
[0:27:23] <%ggbhtg> You got blood rage taunts too. @WoolieVersus
[0:27:26] <leith_aziz> Thanks
[0:27:30] <andre11dr> He definitely has shades of Kliff in his with the long range slow swings

[0:29:18] <ergheisu> what's he saying
[0:29:18] <%yusefHD> But does Bloodrage roman cancel when you use it all up? Not sure how that'd work tbh
[0:29:20] <+Taglog7> KomodoHype donut
[0:29:20] <Solidnick18> big style
[0:29:23] <jetjagger222> eat your donuts nago

[0:29:56] <jetjagger222> is this his stage, the rocket buddhas are hilarious
[0:29:58] <+kiradusk4200> ahh hell yeah look at all this bullshit BLAZING
[0:29:59] <+SpiceMastah> YOU CAN SET ACTIONS YES
[0:30:03] <raveous> is there not a setting to display frame data?
[0:30:05] <Applecannon63> I apparently Gio got a good Dustloop
[0:30:07] <%X2Eliah> I can't wait to see what is this game's "Big Band taunt"
[0:30:07] <Treuan> That is a sick training mode
[0:30:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Good QoL
[0:30:13] <NotHereToStream> they had this setting in GBVS
[0:30:14] <+SpiceMastah> @raveous no
[0:30:16] <%OldManJEWc> it feels like the game plan would be to get into blood rage mid combo in the corner
[0:30:17] <xeros720> wow, can even lab reactions
[0:30:18] <raveous> damn
[0:30:31] <+colbyninjas> zato has some insane taunts
[0:30:38] <+M08Xrd> So sick Kreygasm
[0:30:41] <+someyounguy1> hey hey hows nago feelin?
[0:30:55] <majindusto> OMG...Is this Nagoryuki's Theme???
[0:30:59] <TheVoltStrike> i guess just hit him now?
[0:31:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:31:03] <+OK__Gamer> yeah, this is a an good soundtrack
[0:31:07] <chromonaut747> goddamn this tune
[0:31:07] <Toottootpants> Counter attack is on once you set it
[0:31:08] <BlackermanZX> record?
[0:31:13] <%yusefHD> I haven't played XRD, but what's going on with Slayer? When can we have Vamp on Vamp crime?
[0:31:13] <Mibeador> I think you just need to hit him now for him to jump after block
[0:31:14] <Vaunno> @majindusto hell ye it is
[0:31:15] <ElPlasa> I think it's already set?
[0:31:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> apparently L3 is a dash macro for easier RC movement, among other stuff
[0:31:17] <%X2Eliah> This music would hve been better with lyrics in japanese
[0:31:24] <Finchit> this is some sonic forces tier music
[0:31:27] <+smevvster> It's "after block", so make him block
[0:31:29] <%yusefHD> Mr. Lore pls help
[0:31:31] <+ForgeTacular14> i think he just does it
[0:31:33] <+SpiceMastah> what do you want him to do?
[0:31:34] <UnfilteredComic> you have to hit him
[0:31:35] <nechronia> This is kinda sad
[0:31:36] <+M08Xrd> Guitar solo goes brrrr Kreygasm
[0:31:38] <+neoexogene> Hey chat and Woolie ! Did I miss a lot ?
[0:31:38] <ruggles322> I just realized Nago‚Äôs selection plate says he is a Vampire
[0:31:41] <+wjones0415> dude, everything about nagoryuki looks so sick! I cant wait to try him!
[0:31:43] <PainterOfMiniatures> More interesting than the SF training stage music
[0:31:44] <@Menitta> Guilty Gear is always engrish lyrics
[0:31:47] <KaironFortressKnight> mmm thats some good music
[0:31:48] <+M08Xrd> WHAT DO YOU FIGHT FOR
[0:31:55] <%X2Eliah> Guitar Solo goes "Help I was recorded on a Cat"
[0:31:56] <%yusefHD> Base SF4 training theme slaps.
[0:32:07] <leith_aziz> ^
[0:32:07] <jetjagger222> unless its the GGX vocal album(s) lol
[0:32:08] <Vaunno> @neoexogene just the minimal tutorial lore and nago moveset lol
[0:32:16] <+Footedive> What sword does Ky use now?
[0:32:19] <Applecannon63> Gulity Gear having Engrish lyrics is a stable
[0:32:21] <randominternetsurfer> @woolieversus can you RC Bloodrage?
[0:32:21] <%Buttface_> woolie you already set it
[0:32:26] <ullyzeez> this is gonna be impossible woolie
[0:32:32] <Vaunno> is it not thunderseal?
[0:32:36] <sir_nack> think its still the thunderseal
[0:32:45] <majindusto> Welp...We now know what song will end the Next Podcast lol
[0:32:54] <Vaunno> i think it just got redesigned
[0:32:56] <+Nat1Nerd> Ky is using a redesigned Thunderseal
[0:32:56] <+neoexogene> Oooh Aight ! I‚Äôve been watching Kizzie‚Äôs stream for that Nago preview, he‚Äôs got some crazy stuff
[0:33:00] <BlackermanZX> just noticed its a bit cropped on the right?
[0:33:03] <xUrbanCarnage> Try it on ur self
[0:33:04] <ullyzeez> bruh pls RC it
[0:33:07] <Toni_Master43> Fixed Thunderseal
[0:33:12] <xUrbanCarnage> Two nago‚Äôs
[0:33:20] <Zoggere> If he blocks it on the ground he can punish
[0:33:20] <Smitteys867> Can you only play online during certain timeslots?
[0:33:27] <leith_aziz> For now
[0:33:34] <juxtest> Goodness
[0:33:48] <Vaunno> @Smitteys867 public beta is unlimited for a couple days it seems
[0:33:48] <Applecannon63> Same reason why Sol redesigned his fireseal with his Junkyard Dog
[0:33:48] <ullyzeez> sickkkkkkk
[0:33:50] <%yusefHD> K K K Kiske
[0:33:50] <@Menitta> god thats so much damage
[0:33:54] <%Buttface_> @smitteys867 you can play online for the entire duration of the beta
[0:33:55] <stormhawk9891> Didn't he break his previous sword in that one scene in Rev2 against Sol?
[0:34:01] <Toni_Master43> @Smitteys867 Nah, they can play right now
[0:34:04] <DianaTheAscian> ooo
[0:34:11] <BourneWarrior> OOOO
[0:34:12] <BlackermanZX> damage is nuts
[0:34:15] <DianaTheAscian> poooooo
[0:34:29] <%Javaa01> @stormhawk9891 He chips the hilt on the Eclair
[0:34:29] <neonarcadia> The double 5K extension is really slick
[0:34:36] <SleeplessArtPunk> triple jab lol
[0:34:38] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie should play matches against Sajam and Kizzie Kappa
[0:34:40] <therealtacopancakes> that character looks sick
[0:34:53] <raveous> can you RC the bloodrage btw
[0:34:56] <+colbyninjas> 2/3 blood gauge from one combo oof
[0:35:01] <%baka_sugoi> 5K
[0:35:03] <+neoexogene> Nago has some crazy potential from all the streams I‚Äôve seen, Bloodrage at the end allows you to chip the opponent to death super easily
[0:35:08] <Kiaayo> damn i didn't know this dude was so big
[0:35:11] <B_O_N_G_O_S> CanCan combo
[0:35:16] <TukeArt> that double boot
[0:35:17] <Vaunno> he's a unit indeed
[0:35:19] <DianaTheAscian> lot of people today
[0:35:20] <ElPlasa> YOO
[0:35:20] <Applecannon63> Nago>Ragna
[0:35:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> HALF HEALTH
[0:35:21] <BoxNavy> :O
[0:35:21] <NotHereToStream> corner carry boi
[0:35:22] <%Ether101_Prime> Any combos that don't work in blood rage mode yet?
[0:35:22] <ullyzeez> yo?!
[0:35:23] <Kiaayo> at least 1.25 kens
[0:35:24] <+azraith> This man hits you and it HURTS
[0:35:30] <Lunalios> Kick
[0:35:35] <+colbyninjas> hit em with da Timbs
[0:35:35] <neonarcadia> You might be able to drop the last 5K after the second teleport
[0:35:38] <sir_nack> lol 5k>5k
[0:35:38] <MBDiana1> Are there any combo trials in the game?
[0:35:42] <BlackermanZX> the kick is pretty good
[0:35:45] <double_zr_tap> what's his grab like I wonder?
[0:35:52] <+neoexogene> And there‚Äôs all kinds of setup where you can use Fukyo during blockstun to set up the command grab
[0:35:54] <xeros720> the combo trials are still in development i believe
[0:35:54] <%kyh9> Try second RC?
[0:35:54] <jetjagger222> its a bite that heals you
[0:35:55] <mr_mister0> akmost
[0:35:55] <Vaunno> @MBDiana1 not in the trial i think
[0:35:56] <%Buttface_> @mbdiana1 there probably will be on release, but not in the beta
[0:36:00] <DianaTheAscian> oooo
[0:36:00] <Smitteys867> Wait, the guilty gear website says the beta was supposed to start Feb 17th, 7pm PT.... im confused
[0:36:01] <%kyh9> Second RC when they're up against the wall
[0:36:04] <+harsimus> his normal throw is sick
[0:36:18] <Applecannon63> I don't there is trials but they're planning some sort of mission style mode
[0:36:18] <NotHereToStream> rc the throw?
[0:36:21] <sir_nack> @Smitteys867 influencers get early codes
[0:36:22] <xeros720> that combo recipe settings thing might let you make your own combo trials i think?
[0:36:22] <Vaunno> @Smitteys867 media codes for ""influencers""
[0:36:24] <ullyzeez> @smitteys867 woolie got that influencer drip
[0:36:25] <neonarcadia> @Smitteys867 Content creators get to take part in an early beta to drum up hype
[0:36:30] <DedlokPM> @Smitteys867 people who preordered get it a day earlier
[0:36:34] <Cosairen> @Smitteys867 influencers used influence points to get a day early
[0:36:36] <double_zr_tap> could the grab be different with full blood?
[0:36:42] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ HYPE
[0:36:48] <%SonxGokuu> SonxGokuu subscribed with Prime.
[0:36:59] <%MooseIsGoose> Yay just got power back at my apartment in Texas.
[0:37:07] <Cosairen> nice
[0:37:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @MooseIsGoose Yaaay
[0:37:20] <Vaunno> so he has both a dust grab and a wild throw type thing, right?
[0:37:21] <+capnshupe> Heck yeah bud @mooseisgoose
[0:37:28] <ullyzeez> @mooseisgoose nice!
[0:37:32] <%X2Eliah> Pretty wild how texas got effed up by a bit of snow
[0:37:35] <+neoexogene> The range on that lad
[0:37:48] <DedlokPM> @Smitteys867 my bad. I remembered the dates wrong. Yeah I guess it is Influencers then pre-orders, then everyone
[0:37:52] <ullyzeez> @vaun0x yup a throw and a command grab
[0:37:55] <%MooseIsGoose> Heating up some Chili as fast as possible.
[0:37:59] <+colbyninjas> feels like half the roster has a. command grab now lol
[0:38:01] <%ashgray2520> ashgray2520 subscribed with Prime.
[0:38:01] <%SonxGokuu> Can his clone be hit like chipp's?
[0:38:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:38:02] <Vaunno> ah, cooool
[0:38:09] <%JD_Lars> JD_Lars subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Hey Woolz. I hope this game is as good as it looks.
[0:38:12] <%Ether101_Prime> Is that the floating nation in the background?
[0:38:18] <+NotaryRotary> !MOTIVATED
[0:38:18] <@Moobot> 2034 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:38:19] <Vaunno> BLOODSUCKING UNIVERSE ain't a bad name
[0:38:27] <%Deft_Thought> @SonxGokuu I think his clone counts as a projectile
[0:38:29] <%MooseIsGoose> I love the way this looks.
[0:38:36] <%Deft_Thought> It's not like Chipp's
[0:38:38] <Irb11> that's what you get when your infrastructure isn't designed for weather this cold
[0:38:47] <+neoexogene> Why the fuck does Ky look like Kirito or whatever the fuck his name is in this color LUL
[0:38:48] <%Gamefriendly> oh shit he got early access? nice, what i'd miss
[0:38:50] <Vaunno> does that mean leo can reflect his clone?
[0:38:51] <+traximus_s> chat how long has he been playing?
[0:38:51] <%SonxGokuu> Oh good! That was something I was worried about
[0:38:53] <+MoistBananaPudd> I can smell it, the game sugoiGuts
[0:38:55] <Bevral> It has momentum yeah
[0:38:56] <lbrownthedestroyer> WOW!
[0:38:56] <%baka_sugoi> what about multiple bites
[0:38:57] <Irb11> I hear their underground gas stores are literally frozen
[0:38:58] <Gloppie> yeah seems acceleration based instead of straight gain and loss
[0:39:09] <%X2Eliah> It has inertia
[0:39:13] <xeros720> and that teleport makes it shoot up the most
[0:39:14] <%Gamefriendly> @hornydino_ looks like he's been on for 45 min
[0:39:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Vaun0x interestingly, Slayer's bite command grab is called the same
[0:39:16] <bv728> Bloodsucking Universe is the same name as Slayer's Throw, nice touch
[0:39:19] <ullyzeez> its like a person's pulse rate
[0:39:22] <Applecannon63> Nagoriyuki is more Sadira combined with Fulgore's engine mechanic
[0:39:25] <+someyounguy1> good to know the bite stops buildup even if its really pumping
[0:39:28] <%Seancicle> ?üëÜüèª
[0:39:30] <Darren716> hornydino_ Bout half an hour, he went through colors and such first
[0:39:30] <%Javaa01> It just resets the timer
[0:39:36] <+traximus_s> @gamefriendly alright cool, thanks
[0:39:42] <Vaunno> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ oh shit, really? didn't know that
[0:39:44] <+transporterthesequel> WAIT if you can use bite to offset build does that mean you can go full monkey for a bit?
[0:39:46] <%Ether101_Prime> Does the bite subtract from what you've earned or does it subtract from where its currently is?
[0:39:51] <+traximus_s> @darren716 thanks
[0:39:58] <+neoexogene> Oh good, the bite is a FULL STOP
[0:39:59] <%Holycow8498> Who is the Japanese VA for Nagoriyuki? he sounds familiar but I can't quite place him
[0:40:06] <xeros720> like Ether said, maybe you can stop it while it's in motion
[0:40:06] <lazyagus> So Nago is kinda a mix between Slayer and A.B.A.?

[0:40:21] <%X2Eliah> CAT
[0:40:21] <Vaunno> nago is Taiten Kusunoki
[0:40:21] <bv728> Bite seems to just add a major drain to the bar for a time, not remove a specific amount
[0:40:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Vaun0x yep, wonder what their relationship is, if they even know of each other that is
[0:40:26] <Mr_Zero5232> Crush40?
[0:40:27] <+b_aleph> Guy be losing blood from backdashing
[0:40:29] <agnetj> Sup guys!
[0:40:39] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> can you prevent a rage when its inevitable with a command grab?
[0:40:40] <Applecannon63> Nago is like ABA and a reverse Sin Kyske
[0:40:42] <gregisonline> you can't call a stream that i mean c'mon
[0:40:44] <+colbyninjas> he's a vampire, he gets bloodthirsty
[0:40:45] <Mr_Rakjo> fuck this music is good
[0:40:48] <%DiscoMatador> DiscoMatador subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 10 month streak! I gotta be real I never cared for guilty gear...till N A G O and a certain Lore series forcibly dragged me into this butt rock hell! time to be bad at yet another good ass fighting game thanks to you woolz keep on keeping on
[0:40:53] <RudeRabbit> @Paranoid_Jumbotron Looks like it
[0:40:58] <BlackermanZX> the insane range LUL
[0:40:58] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> are the big counters only on hs and dust?
[0:40:59] <+wjones0415> @X2Eliah vampire
[0:41:00] <FacetiousAF> when you gonna play a good game Kappa
[0:41:00] <Cosairen> @Aeriqui turns off specials makes normals longer and do more damage and drains hp till you land an exclusive super
[0:41:09] <+transporterthesequel> @paranoid_jumbotron yes but only before it fully builds
[0:41:09] <+neoexogene> C O U N T E R
[0:41:13] <Applecannon63> COUNTER set ups
[0:41:19] <lazyagus> @Applecannon63 I see
[0:41:23] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @transporterthesequel SICK
[0:41:23] <xeros720> ah neat, chaining stuff together keeps the meter gain low
[0:41:23] <LoneFonte> @Aeriqui Kinda like a berserk mode, he starts losing a lot of health but some of his attacks get stronger and reach longer
[0:41:23] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah Naw, the guitar solo was recorded on a cat
[0:41:28] <Vaunno> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ someone said he was an unnamed friend of slayer in the lore? might be one guy spouting bs idk
[0:41:29] <+MoistBananaPudd> Good god sugoiWoah
[0:41:38] <%SouLucha> SAMSHO Damange!
[0:41:40] <+Ardailec> C O U N T E R
[0:41:42] <%Calenrow> can we see the bloodrage super counterdamage
[0:41:45] <+Rivalsz> getting hakumen vibes
[0:41:51] <%X2Eliah> Gunther counters
[0:41:53] <BourneWarrior> COUNTER
[0:41:55] <ullyzeez> try jab man
[0:41:56] <Vaunno> can't tell if counter, need bigger text
[0:41:57] <Cosairen> and we thought crush counters looked ridiculous
[0:41:58] <xUrbanCarnage> Fuck Yo Lifebar the character
[0:42:00] <+konnakol> sweet god this game looks insane
[0:42:11] <+neoexogene> Nago is legit just a Samsho character that got lost in the wrong game, and I fucking love it
[0:42:12] <GravityMilkShake> ky looks like hes from FE3H with those colors
[0:42:20] <%SonxGokuu> Watching Nago walk after all of the teleporting is so jarring
[0:42:24] <$arcielardor> will it be released on PC?
[0:42:26] <Abd0022> is this the new GG?
[0:42:27] <ullyzeez> no its not lmao
[0:42:31] <+MoistBananaPudd> Smash the twink, embrace dreads
[0:42:33] <Vaunno> @arcielardor yep, just no beta
[0:42:37] <+neoexogene> My man went like ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt feudal Japan...‚Äù but still went with it
[0:42:42] <$arcielardor> dang
[0:42:46] <Vaunno> ikr
[0:42:48] <randominternetsurfer> @abd0022 no, this is Partick
[0:42:50] <LoneFonte> @arcielardor steam page is already up for preorder
[0:42:55] <Vaunno> ^^^^
[0:42:55] <DianaTheAscian> oooo
[0:42:56] <%X2Eliah> If this comes out on pc too, will it be crossplay?
[0:42:58] <Applecannon63> PC will happen but no Beta so they don't get Datamined
[0:43:06] <miltoned91> is baiken on this game?
[0:43:07] <Vaunno> @X2Eliah not as far as we know
[0:43:08] <sir_nack> so have we determined exactly what causes big counter vs normal counter text?
[0:43:10] <+tuchpi> no crossplay
[0:43:13] <sparked963> some of Nago's skins give him facial hair too.
[0:43:13] <+MoistBananaPudd> Crossplay?
[0:43:15] <Cosairen> no baiken
[0:43:15] <%X2Eliah> ah k
[0:43:16] <GuiltyYear> @X2Eliah They said that PS4 and PS5 have crossplay, but no PC crossplay
[0:43:16] <bv728> PS4/PS5 is only confirmed Crossplay
[0:43:16] <ullyzeez> @neoexogene i mean baiken and anji are in the game so he isnt so out of place
[0:43:17] <RudeRabbit> @X2Eliah No Crossplay. Makes PC version basically pointless
[0:43:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Vaun0x hm, I've certainly never heard of that but who knows, there's so little we know about GG vampires that it's hard to say either way
[0:43:25] <Equirah> @X2Eliah crossplay only between ps4 and ps5
[0:43:25] <alephalpha> yooooo woolie how fast does nago's command throw seem and how does the frame data look like trying to command dash -> command grab?
[0:43:27] <Applecannon63> No crossplay for PC for now
[0:43:27] <+MoistBananaPudd> Boooo
[0:43:30] <%baka_sugoi> 5K in to RRC
[0:43:30] <randominternetsurfer> @miltoned91 we don't know, but most likely DLC
[0:43:34] <Toni_Master43> Didn't they say that eventually crossplay would be implemented?
[0:43:37] <Vaunno> they said they'd try adding crossplay in one of the dev backyards, I think
[0:43:39] <%Javaa01> @Applecannon63 That and I would imagine the PC port isn't done yet
[0:43:39] <%X2Eliah> Makes sense I guess, pc version is gonna be the first one to get cheated inti oblivion
[0:43:41] <NotHereToStream> slash/hard slash/specials do big counters if i had to guess
[0:43:49] <NotHereToStream> punch/kick do normal counter
[0:44:05] <DianaTheAscian> oooo
[0:44:06] <+0neReeler> to the rage
[0:44:08] <solidoutlaw> can you RC blood rage activation on hit?
[0:44:10] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> can you rc the pop?
[0:44:10] <+neoexogene> @ullyzeez oh no don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs out of place, but his gameplay looks so Samsho-esque that he feels like he‚Äôs from another game
[0:44:11] <%Noonoox12> ArcSys has said they want to add PS-PC crossplay in a later update, but no hard confirms
[0:44:14] <damnyell_> @rameiramaster yea, but it's not confirmed they will add it, they said they will try to implement it
[0:44:16] <Vaunno> @X2Eliah and it'll get datamined to hell and back lmao
[0:44:16] <Finchit> I cant wait for dsp to play this
[0:44:28] <Toni_Master43> @rameiramaster Oh ok
[0:44:30] <ElPlasa> wait, you can mash dp after the clone? SICK
[0:44:37] <TrashLeviathan> thats so siiccckkkk
[0:44:41] <alephalpha> yooooo woolie how fast does nago's command throw seem and how does the frame data look like trying to command dash -> command grab?
[0:44:49] <SynderFGC> he has special to Special cancels yeah
[0:44:54] <ullyzeez> theres auto combos
[0:44:56] <Cosairen> @solidoutlaw someone said you can in chat but woolie hasnt done it yet so idk
[0:45:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> How we feeling about Dust in this game? it feels like the best of both worlds to me idk
[0:45:01] <Vaunno> actually, is there a frame by frame setting?
[0:45:01] <+Davos_Southway> @Noonoox12 do you where they said that?
[0:45:02] <%baka_sugoi> how are jump normels
[0:45:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:45:07] <NotHereToStream> 40% off a dust
[0:45:08] <+LordAngry> I love that Nago is basically the replacement character for A.B.A. Has a boss mode that self damages, situational mobility, and that one special is her dragonpunch dust with the nice lift and dunk strike
[0:45:20] <alephalpha> he seems verys imilar to sin actually
[0:45:23] <%fozzle_> LIKE A FUCKING TRUCK
[0:45:25] <Applecannon63> honestly I'm glad auto combos were implemented in that dust
[0:45:28] <Sudowoodo45> HALF HIS HEALTH OH MY GOD
[0:45:28] <%JaseAdrift> SIIICK
[0:45:34] <BlackermanZX> i think there was a way to make the pop safe with rc or sumthin
[0:45:34] <theredfox930000> woolie jwongMAH lijoeFace ifcHypes ifcWow tstyNoise tstyNoise2 ifcWong lijoeGod atpRtsd tstyNoise2 tstyNoise2
[0:45:35] <%JaseAdrift> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:45:39] <%SonxGokuu> This dude hits like grown ass man holy shit
[0:45:41] <Finaldragoon> @NotHereToStream you have to take guts into account so that's more like 25%
[0:45:42] <alephalpha> same kinda deisgn space that sin, kliff and a.b.a a bit take
[0:45:43] <+noblockking> idk if you've gone over it, but can you see if you can jump cancel his command dash?
[0:45:44] <Vaunno> oh GOD
[0:45:47] <+neoexogene> Raw dust is 50% FUCKING PERCENT
[0:45:48] <MyNameIsRasus> don't let nago dust you
[0:45:53] <MyNameIsRasus> just straight up
[0:45:57] <Toni_Master43> You seem to fall to fast
[0:46:01] <NotHereToStream> @Finaldragoon not for chipp Kappa
[0:46:03] <+Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> it looks so goofy LUL
[0:46:07] <Vaunno> more like 30% because of guts, but still
[0:46:10] <+Arsenic_8> guts is a thing in GG, thats probably more like 25%
[0:46:10] <Applecannon63> Sadly you can't super during Auto Dust
[0:46:10] <+SpaceCapnCrone> do it just to clown on 'em
[0:46:12] <sir_nack> remember guys, the health bar lies in GG because of guts. that's definiely not actually 50%
[0:46:14] <%X2Eliah> dust = ded
[0:46:15] <Dave_VD> The opponent can burst too, which looks cool
[0:46:22] <%JaseAdrift> so close
[0:46:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> DUST EM TO THE MOON
[0:46:35] <ullyzeez> so dumb lmao
[0:46:36] <Mibeador> you could try the fast RC where you input a move to cancel the bubble
[0:46:38] <TrashLeviathan> maybe fast rc it?
[0:46:40] <+harsimus> style points
[0:46:40] <Sapphire_Breeze> THE STYLE THO
[0:46:40] <Zoggere> What happens if you bait a burst in dust animation
[0:46:41] <+LoadingFWANK> red roman?
[0:46:41] <NotHereToStream> if only nago had an aerial special
[0:46:41] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> @LordAngry as an aba fan this character makes me both really happy and super bummed
[0:46:45] <%SonxGokuu> It's worth it for the flex tho
[0:46:45] <+konnakol> guts is the silliest thing
[0:46:46] <sparked963> I thought they took out guts
[0:46:48] <%Ether101_Prime> Is it possible to get more air time or RC them at such a point that they're still stun at the end?
[0:46:48] <OblivionSword1> it's stylish AF tho
[0:46:53] <Vaunno> oh yeah, you can burst the startup of axl time stop
[0:46:53] <%JaseAdrift> YEEEEAH ITS COOL THOUGH
[0:46:56] <+SpaceCapnCrone> take your meter and THROW IT ON THE GROUND
[0:46:59] <Applecannon63> you can input super in dust but it doesn't connect sadly
[0:47:00] <+Rivalsz> guts still alive and well
[0:47:01] <SirDuke26> Guts is still in
[0:47:03] <%gatorafan> It does mental damage Kappa
[0:47:08] <+konnakol> guts is dumb
[0:47:10] <SamHellbent> Its always worth it if it kills
[0:47:12] <%Javaa01> @sparked963 It's less aggressive and only starts kicking in after 50%, but it's very much there
[0:47:21] <Applecannon63> guts is dumb but great
[0:47:26] <+neoexogene> That‚Äôs for the special occasions where you wanna flex on people
[0:47:26] <SynderFGC> Is there frame data?
[0:47:52] <ullyzeez> @synderfgc no that scares the casuals
[0:47:52] <+konnakol> @Applecannon63 why is it great? To me it just makes it harder to tell how much more I need to do to win.
[0:47:57] <+noblockking> it guard breaks
[0:47:59] <+moonxbearx> woolie if youre gonna hop online everyones in japan floor 10
[0:47:59] <Mibeador> maybe because it's a guard break>
[0:48:00] <Zoggere> Is 236k full invincible if you hold it down? Like can you teleport through supers
[0:48:01] <+ForgeTacular14> did that "guard break"?
[0:48:02] <alephalpha> yooooo woolie how fast does nago's command throw seem and how does the frame data look like trying to command dash -> command grab?
[0:48:02] <SynderFGC> @ullyzeez smh
[0:48:03] <sparked963> Ahh okay. ty
[0:48:12] <%FabledGuy> can you rc him going into bloodrage
[0:48:17] <Memitim> no health drain in training mode?
[0:48:28] <sir_nack> guts makes more sense with hellfire mode, not sure if thats still in strive
[0:48:29] <NotHereToStream> hifight has a nago clip
[0:48:30] <ElPlasa> maybe there's counter attack options for guard break? @WoolieVersus
[0:48:32] <Vaunno> @Zoggere I don't think it's hold, isn't each dash a K press?
[0:48:33] <Applecannon63> Guts is better comback mechanic than hellfire
[0:48:34] <elmo_s_friend> msusDamn msusDamn msusDamn
[0:48:41] <MyNameIsRasus> these boots are made for kickin
[0:48:58] <+IZenora> guts isn't a real comback mechanic, it just makes maches feel closer
[0:49:02] <alephalpha> dash into dp maybe?
[0:49:11] <WillofGame> Hey Woolie, how are you doing today/
[0:49:11] <+neoexogene> I see Nago met up with Gran to learn the art of the B O O T
[0:49:12] <+IZenora> ''hides" your real hp is all
[0:49:13] <BaslerJones> can you cancel the second slash into something else to extend ?
[0:49:16] <Zoggere> Guts matters for getting poked out by projectiles
[0:49:23] <SynderFGC> anything interesting off Bloodrage RC? Can you even?
[0:49:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> He got some stompers on him lmaoo
[0:49:28] <%JaseAdrift> Nagos theme is so good
[0:49:38] <sir_nack> i think there are some combo routing decisions based around guts too
[0:49:47] <jamox1> Does this game have negative edges?
[0:49:50] <sir_nack> but not sure how much that is in strive
[0:49:50] <ElPlasa> YOOOOOOOOOO

[0:53:00] <jetjagger222> @stabbityrabbit and the UI
[0:53:01] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[0:53:01] <Applecannon63> good
[0:53:05] <%wibbwobbler> honestly tho
[0:53:07] <+neoexogene> The slide on the stomp makes it super good
[0:53:07] <bv728> Netcode is good
[0:53:10] <leith_aziz> The gattling change or the lobby ?
[0:53:13] <SynderFGC> Woolie, how's the framerate??
[0:53:14] <%jaggstar2020> On a scale from Pat to having Access to the Beta, how much fun is it?
[0:53:14] <+Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> @WoolieVersus Since his clone is a projectile, can you dash cancel it into Cmd grab for potential mix?
[0:53:15] <ElPlasa> OH
[0:53:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Has Johns been summoned. Or we only Lab Time
[0:53:20] <domvito1234> @WoolieVersus you playing on ps4 or ps5? if ps5, there any haptic feedback implemented?
[0:53:21] <bv728> Seen some JPN-USA matches that looked good in the morning session
[0:53:21] <sir_nack> wallbreaks are also a major point of contention
[0:53:21] <stormhawk9891> @MK_Ineptitude Netcodes great, lobby is still ass tho
[0:53:23] <leith_aziz> The netcode is fantastic
[0:53:23] <jokertrick88> JP vs NA matches have appeared quite stable with next to no delay
[0:53:26] <T_Sasquatch> Me and my Nagos pulled up in a white toyota
[0:53:26] <+Suneater_Jerome> got that threating Sbroly stomp
[0:53:28] <%slayabee> BoooOOOOSh
[0:53:29] <%baka_sugoi> S A U C E
[0:53:38] <+transporterthesequel> OOOOKAY
[0:53:39] <+yeknomlive> netcode is very good from what I've seen. japan to Australia, usa to Japan looked solid
[0:53:39] <Minh_Li> This is on ps5 right?
[0:53:43] <+MK_Ineptitude> oh shit. good netcode???? bout damn time lmao
[0:53:43] <Vaunno> fps is even solid on base PS4, based on fps analysis vids
[0:53:43] <%baka_sugoi> RC
[0:53:45] <+Suneater_Jerome> *threatening
[0:53:49] <+neoexogene> @mk_ineptitude Watched multiple streams were there were US vs JP matches with no lag at all
[0:53:52] <leith_aziz> I mean I hate the lobby but the netcode is more important to me
[0:53:53] <Applecannon63> Lobby is sadly bad
[0:53:57] <%JaseAdrift> ps5 ps4 pc
[0:53:58] <leith_aziz> I'm a patient guy
[0:54:00] <jetjagger222> whats the advantage for ps5
[0:54:02] <tacostarvedbeast> i forget is potemkin in this game?
[0:54:04] <bv728> Wifi Warriors are probably not gonna be fixed, but even those will be less important
[0:54:07] <+yeknomlive> yeah lobby still is a problem failing to connect etc
[0:54:13] <Cosairen> @tacostarvedbeast ye
[0:54:14] <%Noonoox12> @tacostarvedbeast yea
[0:54:16] <%MrP33Ps> you can skip the lobby right?
[0:54:17] <%jepupu> Europeans don't get to the beta before Friday :(
[0:54:23] <+MK_Ineptitude> they're including a "just play" button though right? you can avoid lobbies altogether?
[0:54:24] <leith_aziz> If I can play without needing to get IN the lobby then Im fine
[0:54:26] <sparked963> Dash into bite mix?
[0:54:27] <KidKaiser23> Wow, and I thought this Beta was PS5 only
[0:54:31] <T_Sasquatch> open beta ?
[0:54:39] <%jepupu> Open beta... if you preorder.
[0:54:41] <stabbityrabbit> @jetjagger222 That's my actual biggest gripe with this game. I like the idea of a more minimal faded ink style, but then they have the combo counter getting in the way of everything anyway. Feels like two conflicting visions on display.
[0:54:47] <%JaseAdrift> open beta is the 18th
[0:54:47] <Applecannon63> they will include a just play option in the main game
[0:54:48] <leith_aziz> There's an option to matchmake without lobbies so thats great
[0:54:50] <T_Sasquatch> @jepupu -_-
[0:54:51] <+saltpiggu> I think the regular kick combos
[0:54:54] <sir_nack> @jepupu no its open to everyone thursday
[0:54:57] <+Drbear4u> @T_Sasquatch Open Beta Thursday
[0:55:00] <+yeknomlive> the open beta is for everyone but preorder get 1 extra day early

[0:55:07] <%jepupu> Alright, cool
[0:55:11] <animecupz> maybe just one kick
[0:55:14] <KidKaiser23> But will the Beta be on PS4?
[0:55:18] <+Drbear4u> ye
[0:55:21] <jetjagger222> @stabbityrabbit dude the combo counter is so massive; could easily been solved by making it bright orange but a more manageable size
[0:55:21] <Vaunno> yes
[0:55:26] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @domvito1234
[0:55:28] <Cosairen> got that haehyun spin in there
[0:55:28] <%JaseAdrift> why would it not
[0:55:29] <KidKaiser23> Oh FVCK YEAH
[0:55:33] <+saltpiggu> You can get another hit after the double kick I seen it
[0:55:38] <CyrusVGZ> Mom, can we have Red Hot Chili Peppers? We have Red Hot Chili Peppers at home.
[0:55:41] <T_Sasquatch> i find it really interesting how japanese games have alt colors that just change a characters skin color
[0:55:44] <leith_aziz> About the UI the only thing I think is BAD is the combo counter
[0:55:47] <NotHereToStream> command dash cancel
[0:55:49] <%slayabee> Can you dash cancel after the 2nd hit of the DP?
[0:55:51] <KidKaiser23> I thought Strive was PS5 exclusive, I haven‚Äôt been keepin up wit the news that much
[0:55:57] <leith_aziz> It gets too big and lacks flair
[0:56:06] <%JaseAdrift> @kidkaiser23 it never was
[0:56:11] <leith_aziz> Strive is available for PS4 and PC also
[0:56:11] <Frogwash> How long does the beta last?
[0:56:13] <ullyzeez> why would they let 8 people play the beta?@kidkaiser23
[0:56:15] <+yeknomlive> theres a free ps5 upgrade too btw
[0:56:17] <sparked963> Nago gets different facial hair too
[0:56:18] <WillofGame> @CyrusVGZ that's good, I like that.
[0:56:20] <guymontag0> Kizzie says netcode is Mad Good
[0:56:21] <Vaunno> LUL
[0:56:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why Kykiske looks like the average Brazilian male?
[0:56:28] <stabbityrabbit> @jetjagger222 Worse than that is the positive notifier. Why isn't it just a little green faded ink "Positive" above the meter?
[0:56:28] <vstpnv> it announced way before ps5
[0:56:30] <+neoexogene> @cyrusvgz Damn if the homegrown Red Hot Chili Peppers are this good then I‚Äôm happy
[0:56:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @leith_aziz
[0:56:40] <+traximus_s> @t_sasquatch as long as you don't make them lighter. people will get mad
[0:56:45] <wisconsinjoe> Netcode mad good PogChamp
[0:56:56] <KidKaiser23> Ive never been happier to be wrong!

[0:57:27] <%Eaglestrike117> How much time do you have left to lab by the way? or are you not on a time limit?
[0:57:29] <Applecannon63> Gio got some wierd but interesting palette swaps when she is in her full meter mode
[0:57:32] <+MK_Ineptitude> cross play between the platforms?
[0:57:33] <Vaunno> @mechslayer71 I think the nest online block is not for a few hours

[0:57:47] <Ciglossonjr> God Nagoriyuki is fucking massive
[0:57:50] <alephalpha> labbing is important

[0:59:54] <+funya_rinpa> Play what looks cool, don't spend so much time playing what people call easy if you're not interested in it.
[0:59:57] <MKII> any highly populated game is a good option if that's your concern

[1:00:05] <zer0enixx> So is this just gonna be a labbing session, or are you going online ?
[1:00:08] <+neoexogene> Honestly Strive is looking like a good option to start out
[1:00:08] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Strive will be a good starting game

[1:00:22] <leith_aziz> Many will play this for now, so it's a good entry point
[1:00:27] <jetjagger222> its got a good opportunity to snare people who wash out of SFV
[1:00:34] <+traximus_s> @zer0enixx going online later
[1:00:47] <%gatorafan> People are saying that if you become a V-Tuber Jiyuna will come hunt you down with a gorilla Kappa

[1:01:56] <%Deft_Thought> @sonofthedeepsouth Mike was talking about heading over to Kizzie Kay's to play on his stream
[1:01:56] <leith_aziz> That wasn't a bad idea to bring in some general streamers
[1:02:02] <jetjagger222> because they're both boomer vampires
[1:02:03] <%NeonPopT> NeonPopT subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 2 months! wait is this game out already. or is this a beta?

[1:02:28] <Triplicat> this is closed influencer beta, tomorrow is pre-order beta, the day after is open beta
[1:02:31] <CyrusVGZ> Hot Take: Arena fighting games are good and should be in the discussion when people talk about fighting games and fighting games being accessible.

[1:02:58] <+PeaceCentennial> that looks super tight

[1:03:02] <jetjagger222> shades of green hand into SPD
[1:03:06] <+MK_Ineptitude> do you get early access to the beta if you order from amazon? or do you have to order from a specific store?

[1:03:22] <%JaseAdrift> @cyrusvgz and no one agreed... woolieMINHMAX
[1:03:25] <jetjagger222> is the tele invincible
[1:03:34] <KidKaiser23> @cyrusvgz They can‚Äôt be good merely on the basis of style, this is not to say they can‚Äôt be good, but most aren‚Äôt
[1:03:36] <CyrusVGZ> @JaseAdrift That's why it's a hot take.
[1:04:01] <+noblockking> Try going for special moves that build blood meter after since you have negative "blood tension" from bite
[1:04:03] <tacostarvedbeast> who voices nago i wonder, sounds familiar
[1:04:05] <jetjagger222> gundam vs is pretty solid for an arena fighter
[1:04:05] <%wibbwobbler> thats pretty good
[1:04:11] <+neoexogene> Fuuuuck the new RC system looks awesome
[1:04:14] <Vaunno> I'm surprised it's a hot take
[1:04:21] <ElPlasa> admn
[1:04:21] <Mattais88> All these bite combos make me want to go play Mira in KI
[1:04:22] <+PeaceCentennial> that's disgusting
[1:04:25] <jetjagger222> fuckign impenetrable if you play anything else though
[1:04:32] <+LordAngry> could you chain into another command bite? lmao
[1:04:32] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LeRouch_the_Rebel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! "No Baiken, no buy" is coward shit, but not putting in Baiken is also coward shit.
[1:04:45] <Vaunno> @CyrusVGZ what does the FGC think about Pokken?
[1:04:47] <Lavrohas> so is beta actually out out or is this a reviewer and partner early look at beta
[1:04:51] <austinj24> Oh that mix just sold me
[1:04:55] <velgaduere> @LeRouch_the_Rebel coward shit cancels out, therefore, buy game
[1:04:58] <pmmori> @WoolieVersus a tiny bit of the right side of the screen is cut off
[1:04:58] <Triplicat> this is closed influencer beta, tomorrow is pre-order beta, the day after is open beta
[1:05:00] <CyrusVGZ> @Vaun0x No idea. I don't care how the FGC feels anything lol.
[1:05:00] <Darren716> Pokken carries the fgc
[1:05:01] <alephalpha> finally
[1:05:03] <Lavrohas> ah kk
[1:05:10] <leith_aziz> @ullyzeez: She ain't done yet and she actually partook in tournaments

[1:05:12] <%baka_sugoi> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:05:12] <Vaunno> @CyrusVGZ fair lmao
[1:05:13] <Ciglossonjr> I'm so glad to have new music to listen to
[1:05:25] <+RD_nx> I wonder if chaining bites is possible like with slayer
[1:05:25] <Crowroost> ITS BLUD
[1:05:26] <Applecannon63> Arena is only fun when they make combos play like hack'n'slash and not a simple one button
[1:05:28] <tacostarvedbeast> does the jab beat out a neutral jump?
[1:05:30] <raveous> unfortunate thing about the command grab is that it is insaaanely unsafe on whiff
[1:05:34] <NotHereToStream> its a good mix, you can jab or command grab
[1:05:34] <FeedbacK7777> Is it true there's no burst grabs? i've seen a couple people talking about it
[1:05:35] <alephalpha> and the bite will reocver bar
[1:05:37] <+RD_nx> or invincible back jump
[1:05:37] <%JaseAdrift> @lavrohas right now is influencer beta tomorrow preorder and the next day open

[1:06:41] <Applecannon63> blood meter lets him special to special cancel
[1:06:42] <NotHereToStream> yeah its changed
[1:06:44] <Triplicat> @sargewha yes it does, CH 5D or 5[D]
[1:06:46] <raveous> honestly it's so slow, the standard dust should be like 16fr and the hold should be 20fr
[1:06:47] <vingadivo> Nago seems to be one of those Woolie made characters

[1:11:23] <mandjelo> DO NOT ENGAGE WITH BLANKA PLAYERS
[1:11:23] <+Agentoracle> Okay, so, Axl is "I win neutral", and Nago is "You *had* life", so Good is gonna have to be "I'll let you know when my combo ends"

[1:12:14] <Vaunno> gio and rei trash talk the shit outta you on their victory screen
[1:12:14] <+neoexogene> @peacecentennial more like really low entry floor but high skill ceiling because you can get really creative with her

[1:12:16] <+Davos_Southway> Someone posted the difference earlier
[1:12:17] <vingadivo> Woolie her skin collor changes depending on the collor you choose in character select

[1:12:55] <vingadivo> tempestade = storm
[1:12:56] <Zombrocom> 6H has multiple hits
[1:12:57] <+MisleadingEchoes> SEPULTURA = Grave in ptbr
[1:12:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Tombstone, Thunder, Rising Sun, Setting Sun are the translations for her special moves
[1:13:03] <Picia000123> Her win poses are her doggo doing doggo things, it's great
[1:13:06] <Vaunno> preorder beta is tomorrow, no>
[1:13:08] <R0kushi> sepultura is a brazilian metal band
[1:13:09] <solidoutlaw> that super builds meter
[1:13:11] <+RD_nx> I'm debating leaving the grappler master race to join the blood rage clan
[1:13:12] <+egalitarian696969> height restriction?
[1:13:13] <Sniarru> her alt colours change her skin glow colour too i believe
[1:13:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:13:15] <+neoexogene> The mechanics of Strive complement her playstyle super well, she can do crazy stuff with a small but efficient toolkit
[1:13:15] <solidoutlaw> the air super
[1:13:16] <jotabranded> T√Å ME ZOANDO QUE COLOCARAM SEPULTURA kkkkk
[1:13:16] <ullyzeez> woahhh
[1:13:16] <randominternetsurfer> @woolieversus Max says she has Crazy but HARD to execute combos.
[1:13:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Didn't quite catch her Overdrive name to ranslate it
[1:13:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Her Spirit Dog name now confirmed to be Caramelo
[1:13:32] <+MisleadingEchoes> Ventania
[1:13:32] <DianaTheAscian> I adore this stage
[1:13:33] <%LastHazzerd> is gatling even in the game?
[1:13:35] <+MisleadingEchoes> That is Windstorm
[1:13:40] <Vaunno> it's Rei lol
[1:13:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah it is
[1:13:51] <Ciglossonjr> This is literally the best looking and sounding fighting game in existence
[1:13:51] <Applecannon63> she has a gatling but very limitef
[1:13:52] <%Seancicle> gotta jet üõÉ
[1:13:54] <OblivionSword1> nothing would happen
[1:13:56] <KidKaiser23> This is a great stage
[1:13:57] <Triplicat> happen if what
[1:13:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Que legal que os nomes t√£o em br
[1:14:00] <lazyagus> @sonofthedeepsouth great name tbh
[1:14:02] <Triplicat> oh
[1:14:06] <+neoexogene> @lasthazzerd in some form, S and HS chain, P is primarily pokes, K can go into D
[1:14:07] <Applecannon63> sadly it doesn't work
[1:14:12] <Vashido22> thats so jank
[1:14:23] <jetjagger222> RIP bitrate
[1:14:24] <+FaderPotater> yeah saw max earlier as well. he mentioned she has a lot of safe stuff but hard to execute long combos
[1:14:31] <+GrandmasterBFunk> yeah max figured this out, it's a waster
[1:14:32] <Applecannon63> that super can connect but nothing happens after that
[1:14:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is it?
[1:14:33] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[1:14:52] <Applecannon63> it would be sick if it happened
[1:14:55] <+MisleadingEchoes> She is the msot dissapointing character sadly. She looks great but her stuff is pretty straight forward
[1:14:58] <KidKaiser23> ‚ÄúWaste a bar for same time on the clock!!!‚Äù
[1:15:05] <+MisleadingEchoes> Everyone expected naruru from samsho
[1:15:06] <jetjagger222> its like riptor tailflip
[1:15:11] <BlackermanZX> Max figured out some crazy shit
[1:15:11] <Karhax> i think flipkick is safe right?
[1:15:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> How many dog shenanigans do you need?
[1:15:17] <%LastHazzerd> people wanted ZWEI, smh
[1:15:17] <velgaduere> looking forward to the buff patch that makes her as cool as she looks
[1:15:20] <%JaseAdrift> Nothing disappointing about her
[1:15:25] <Irb11> I mean they did say she was for beginners
[1:15:25] <rideroftraps1> Os nomes em pt e invrivel
[1:15:27] <%emperordread> Should we start calling Gio "Woolie Maiden"?
[1:15:30] <+ChildishFrambino> Oh
[1:15:31] <%JaseAdrift> She's literally Beginners character
[1:15:32] <%Javaa01> @FaderPotater Yeah she seems like a very beginner friendly built character, since you get bonuses in case you forget to utilize your bar, not having very long combo structures and having a lot of safe stuff
[1:15:34] <+MisleadingEchoes> Tons of dissapointing stuff, she doesn't use the dog, its just a scarf
[1:15:34] <pitabears> dog is just asethetic
[1:15:34] <%Calenrow> kizzy was workin some folks earlier on gio
[1:15:42] <LinxGG> i expected more specials or interactions with her dog
[1:15:42] <Applecannon63> honestly glad she is not a puppet character
[1:15:43] <KidKaiser23> That Dog really is jus a weapon, nothing more or less
[1:15:44] <+MisleadingEchoes> And her gameplan is straight forward
[1:15:48] <jotabranded> that clock is the roman cancel?
[1:15:49] <David_de_Bergerac> FLIP KICK HITS ON THE FRONTLIP TOO
[1:15:50] <gulthrax> Woolz a May main, bruh?
[1:15:53] <wisconsinjoe> I would just like ONE move that uses the dog on its own for something
[1:15:55] <LinxGG> @jotabranded yes
[1:15:56] <+Agentoracle> I think 75% of her stuff is just *safe*, she doesn't really have any end or startup lag
[1:15:58] <Darren716> SOCIETY
[1:15:59] <+neoexogene> @misleadingechoes I get what you‚Äôre saying but I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs that disappointing honestly, she has crazy potential, but I agree that not using the dog more for her moves is a missed opportunity
[1:15:59] <jetjagger222> SOCIETY
[1:16:02] <Vaunno> the wolf is a scarf LUL

[1:18:02] <%JaseAdrift> @misleadingechoes HA NOT IN THIS GAME
[1:18:07] <BlackermanZX> He goes full anime
[1:18:10] <Applecannon63> Sol will get his DI later in the full game
[1:18:14] <vingadivo> so what's a dragon install?
[1:18:16] <+MisleadingEchoes> @JaseAdrift yeah but, think about it, wouldn't be hype? Galford with Kim?

[1:18:47] <leith_aziz> I think Sol's dragon install might be made in a later revision
[1:18:48] <vingadivo> all stages are incredible
[1:18:56] <%LastHazzerd> "let's time it properly" is the bulk of this game it seems
[1:19:09] <Triplicat> you can absolutely end with RTL
[1:19:11] <+MisleadingEchoes> They said the Dragon Install will come later so probably story/dlc related.
[1:19:11] <+neoexogene> HOLY SHIT
[1:19:14] <Cosairen> i mean its most of fighting games
[1:19:18] <Triplicat> yeah there you go
[1:19:20] <jetjagger222> might be able to do sacred edge after the juggle?
[1:19:20] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:19:21] <Applecannon63> I hope the full game gives Ky a summon sword

[1:29:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> Japan time
[1:29:23] <+PeaceCentennial> I still can't believe that Sol bot just did 3 DPs in a row like it was natural. Truly the advanced AI tech.
[1:29:24] <OkamiDude15> japan time
[1:29:24] <%Eaglestrike117> Floor 6 has people woolie
[1:29:25] <Saltmeisterr> theres someone on the 6th floor

[1:31:42] <+funya_rinpa> This is so strange for no reason
[1:31:43] <Solidnick18> huh
[1:31:44] <%LastHazzerd> The netcode is great, the lobby is the absolute worst
[1:31:44] <ullyzeez> i though you could only play until midnight JP time?
[1:31:48] <+Rafraud> I'm so lost

[1:32:01] <xUrbanCarnage> This thing is pretty crap
[1:32:03] <+PapaGravestone> just got in, whats the consensus so far?
[1:32:03] <Darren716> Why isn't there just one button that says play?
[1:32:04] <Jnkolm> You have to go through a lot of effort to make a lobby system this bad
[1:32:06] <Prevot> why didn't they scrape this whole system when EVERYONE hated it?
[1:32:07] <TehMud> does the Beta not have the Quickmatch thing?
[1:32:09] <cheap_turbo> woolie looking lonly
[1:32:09] <leith_aziz> Guys we're annoyed by the lobby, but you ain't making a difference just venting okay ?
[1:32:11] <Cosairen> just put in a play queue gods sake

[1:32:31] <Triplicat> japan to east canada would be about 200ms I guess?
[1:32:32] <Lavrohas> does the lobby actually suck in terms of mechanics and functionality or is it just not great looking. im trying to get a good feel for public opinion @WoolieVersus
[1:32:32] <gmbt21xd> i think Footsies is Sajam

[1:33:09] <+PeaceCentennial> this looks REALLY GOOD
[1:33:09] <JonnyJonstar> the top of the screen is cut off?
[1:33:10] <guymontag0> @lavrohas From what I saw, it can be a little janky to connect to someone and because you see someone doesn‚Äôt mean they are available.

[1:35:02] <ullyzeez> hot
[1:35:02] <fringespider> The netcode in this game looks sick
[1:35:02] <+PeaceCentennial> He snapped animations just a tiny bit but it was completely playable
[1:35:03] <leith_aziz> Not for the beta
[1:35:03] <+DocsMistake> Nagoriyuki looks sick as hell, cant wait to try him out when I get my hands on the open beta
[1:35:03] <%kewlmyc> No rematch
[1:35:03] <GuardMeShielder> Nice

[1:35:07] <+konnakol> PogChamp
[1:35:08] <Astrophizz> no instant rematch
[1:35:09] <%JaseAdrift> GOOD NETCODE BOYS
[1:35:09] <cheap_turbo> yeah that rollback is pretty good
[1:35:09] <brunoberserk> smooooooooooooth
[1:35:10] <+superchronicc> play until you squash the shoto
[1:35:10] <chaosjoey> Nice this game might make me get into fighting games
[1:35:11] <%gatorafan> Woolie feels NOTHING
[1:35:11] <%Eaglestrike117> Woolie by the way, screen cuts off the top, so we cant see the connection at all
[1:35:11] <%LastHazzerd> "just yet"
[1:35:12] <leith_aziz> Connections need testing
[1:35:12] <fringespider> no rematch for stress testing purposes
[1:35:13] <+MTLxSpider> nah no rematch button. u have to set it up again.
[1:35:14] <TigerClaws12> game is cropped?
[1:35:14] <+Ane_Ng> The Rollback Frames are being cut off
[1:35:15] <OblivionSword1> no rematch in Beta
[1:35:15] <+GrandmasterBFunk> straight up from what i'm seeing, this is better than KI netcode
[1:35:16] <Serge_12> Fighting games are saved!
[1:35:16] <ullyzeez> scrub aint even worth a rematch
[1:35:17] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> No rematch yet
[1:35:18] <+solzan2000> no rematch for beta I guess
[1:35:18] <pixel_river> he was from japan even
[1:35:20] <wolfmanfocus> Nago looks good
[1:35:20] <leith_aziz> Stress testing
[1:35:22] <Triplicat> ping ms number and how it felt is what matters
[1:35:23] <wisconsinjoe> coneyFACT Bad net code? Not a chance
[1:35:26] <BaslerJones> cant you remove the news thing ?
[1:35:31] <%Noonoox12> top of the screen's slightly cut off. We can't see the connection info
[1:35:31] <pajamarammaslamma> God this lobby sucks
[1:35:35] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:35:35] <%kewlmyc> Also we can't see the top of the screen to see the rollback UI
[1:35:35] <jetjagger222> the art on the upper right makes ky look like he man
[1:35:38] <rocket_da_madman> Woah jiyuna's here
[1:35:38] <Prevot> so even though the netcode seems to work, people will hate playing this online because of the lobby system...
[1:35:39] <+Ascethetic> im sure they'll add it on release
[1:35:39] <leith_aziz> It''ll be in the final product
[1:35:42] <GlaceonYo> same ky
[1:35:42] <+EtherwXlf> They're forcing gameplay with new people to test the network
[1:35:42] <nailwind> its probably not here for Beta so more people play each other
[1:35:44] <guymontag0> No rematch since Arc wants everyone to play against each other.
[1:35:44] <brunoberserk> gentlemen , WE GOT IT
[1:35:44] <+makouzer> @WoolieVersus we can't see the top of the screen very well, its cropped out
[1:35:45] <ullyzeez> its a beta woolie
[1:35:46] <%ekodrop> same guy
[1:35:46] <+neoexogene> And that was CA vs JP
[1:35:47] <+Shishi1205> lvl 41
[1:35:54] <%gatorafan> Oh god the Gorilla is roaming.
[1:35:54] <MyooMyoo> @pajamarammaslamma what do not like about it?
[1:35:55] <KidKaiser23> That makes sense, they‚Äôd wanna test it
[1:35:57] <+neoexogene> So that‚Äôs a pretty solid netcode
[1:35:57] <%LionheartedRebel> at least he came back for the rematch regardless?
[1:36:01] <BlackermanZX> on the top and on the right too
[1:36:02] <+konnakol> I think not having a rematch button is intentional. Means there are more unique connections happening, meaning it's more likely for monitors to find problems.
[1:36:04] <pajamarammaslamma> I will take Strive lobbies with Strive netcode over Xrd Lobbies with Xrd netcode
[1:36:06] <Wild_Samurai> checking the opponents underpants
[1:36:09] <pixel_river> i take a bad lobby set up for good connection any day
[1:36:10] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @transporterthesequel
[1:36:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'm getting whiplash cuz you get like 2-3 minutes of smooth ass online play and immediately get thrust back into the Lobby Hell Dimension
[1:36:12] <BaslerJones> GREED SEVER BS IS BACK
[1:36:14] <tacostarvedbeast> does nago have a decent anti air?
[1:36:16] <+Deko_> no more waiting for the intros to sync PogChamp
[1:36:20] <%baka_sugoi> AMERICAN BURST
[1:36:23] <jetjagger222> @BaslerJones yeye we GGX now
[1:36:26] <rocket_da_madman> strive lobby looks so lame tho
[1:36:28] <miltoned91> good combo
[1:36:30] <%possumwalsh1221> Ky flipping all over the place is wild
[1:36:31] <nailwind> god i love that oversized thing
[1:36:31] <vingadivo> dex vs strenght build
[1:36:32] <fluke_LKZ> The Canadian Burst
[1:36:34] <leith_aziz> Max got pissed about the no rematch, but I thougt the stress test was a logical reasoning
[1:36:35] <Cosairen> @FuqBoiSlim yeah man its jarring as hell
[1:36:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yep
[1:36:38] <Triplicat> clone destroys projectiles so yeah
[1:36:40] <DSD24> Is Ky putting a Debuff on Nago?
[1:36:47] <ullyzeez> woolie cant even beat a vtuber smh
[1:36:47] <Triplicat> not just any debuff
[1:36:47] <DSD24> There's that thunder effect on him
[1:36:48] <KidKaiser23> Once Woolie gets that Anti Air down, he‚Äôll be swatting Ky out the sky
[1:36:50] <+TheIntellectional> its his Shock State
[1:36:52] <Triplicat> S H O C K S T A T E
[1:36:54] <+SodiumPatrol> Ky shmoving like ggXX chipp
[1:36:59] <%CptnCampy61> Smooth out the lobbie system and we got a potential gem on our hands
[1:37:00] <Applecannon63> SHOCK STATE
[1:37:01] <apolitenoob> What does shock state do?
[1:37:01] <brunoberserk> boi ,nago needs a anti-air
[1:37:01] <pajamarammaslamma> @myoomyoo Spacially its just really odd. Like what was wrong with having avatars wonder around to cabs like in other Arcsys games?
[1:37:03] <vingadivo> honestly that katana ins't even oversized, there were real swords like that
[1:37:04] <DSD24> Ok shockstate sounds intense
[1:37:05] <%SUTTONSOMEGA> SUTTONSOMEGA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! woolieGASM
[1:37:05] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @pajamarammaslamma If strive kept xrd lobbies though... man that'd be it.
[1:37:06] <pixel_river> yeah the beta is to test how far the rollback can connect
[1:37:06] <WarchiefGoldva> Can you teleport to your clone or can you only launch it?
[1:37:10] <%gatorafan> woolieSHOOK state?
[1:37:16] <TrashLeviathan> shock state make the next lightining hurt more
[1:37:16] <Carlioo> btw, you can set your preferred stage and theme, so you don't get sick of nago's theme
[1:37:18] <nailwind> @vingadivo probably thinking of odachi then
[1:37:18] <MyooMyoo> your getting
[1:37:19] <MOON__MIST> 2H
[1:37:21] <Triplicat> he can not teleport to it he ain't hibiki lol
[1:37:21] <+konnakol> bro you got shmixed
[1:37:22] <jetjagger222> yeah slow-ass buttons

[1:37:31] <%Mrbaconator> shock state
[1:37:34] <+dollarstored> is the beta in 4k?
[1:37:34] <+Deko_> feels like nago is playing another game LUL
[1:37:35] <Cosairen> @WarchiefGoldva its not like chip no its just a fancy projectile
[1:37:35] <elpennacho> so woolz what are your thoughts so far?
[1:37:37] <+smoshow21> You're playing SamSho, their playing Guilty Gear
[1:37:38] <+AngriestAngryArtist> doesnt he have a command dash?
[1:37:40] <guymontag0> @warchiefgoldva Launch. You can follow up with dash special to confuse someone
[1:37:41] <%baka_sugoi> FOOTSIES
[1:37:42] <tacostarvedbeast> a guilty gear character that can't dash, sounds hard
[1:37:43] <OblivionSword1> @WoolieVersus the screen

[1:37:54] <ainda_> i for one am excited to hear a dog girls scream about how cheap Zato is
[1:37:55] <Bedskirts> @tacostarvedbeast but he can teleport like a rabbit
[1:37:55] <+Rafraud> He also overheads every jump
[1:37:56] <leith_aziz> Daigo ?

[1:39:18] <%ZweihanderSteve> that really eats a lot of health
[1:39:25] <WarchiefGoldva> Bloodrage does a LOT of damage if you land your shots.
[1:39:27] <guymontag0> Fun Fact: Japanese people are strong as hell in GG lore. That‚Äôs why May can hold an anchor like it‚Äôs nothing.
[1:39:28] <+0wen2_> nago blood mode seems like it takes him from a top to a bottom tier
[1:39:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> there's too much shit going on in game twitch can't handle it

[1:44:01] <Triplicat> nagori 2H is fucking huge
[1:44:01] <+Kraftium> That doggo + another doggo + burgers is what made ram not evil
[1:44:06] <Carlioo> @ruderabbit hell yeah it is
[1:44:06] <+BottledLineArt> Seeing a decent mix of characters so far.
[1:44:07] <stormhawk9891> Oooooh boy Infil
[1:44:09] <Triplicat> I'm shocked at how huge it is
[1:44:10] <ullyzeez> @kidkaiser23 yes
[1:44:10] <wisconsinjoe> Gio PogChamp
[1:44:12] <+MisleadingEchoes> Its the real Infiltration?
[1:44:12] <Saltmeisterr> COUNTER
[1:44:12] <+neoexogene> Oh hey it‚Äôs the wife beater
[1:44:14] <+Shishi1205> COUNTER
[1:44:15] <+freystreams> infiltration is still alive???
[1:44:19] <Sapphire_Breeze> COUNTER
[1:44:20] <OkamiDude15> C O U N T E R
[1:44:21] <17sevens> wait how is woolie not playing as this character?
[1:44:21] <nailwind> oh hey, it's Wagner Kappa
[1:44:22] <Lunalios> COUNTER
[1:44:23] <+transporterthesequel> Dp everything
[1:44:24] <BoxNavy> counter :)
[1:44:24] <pixel_river> Ram learned everything was unique through the dog
[1:44:27] <LyricalMaki> he has an Undertaker getup animation:o
[1:44:30] <Saltmeisterr> oh hey its literally scum
[1:44:34] <LazyJustice1> He is categorized as a "One Shot" Character. So he might be designed to not have a ton of opportunities to do his think so you HAVE to make them count when you can get them
[1:44:35] <alephalpha> oh is this actually the wfebeater?
[1:44:35] <Afroperonista> "wife beater" nice agenda btw LUL
[1:44:38] <pookam> ooough 256 ms. does it at least feel ok with rollback
[1:44:41] <+BrickwallsGames> C O U N T E R
[1:44:42] <%kewlmyc> That ping....
[1:44:42] <Lunalios> they're both pretty woolie picks
[1:44:44] <+Dorf1> isnt infil the wifebeater?
[1:44:45] <+Shishi1205> shees
[1:44:46] <BaslerJones> he baited that
[1:44:47] <BoxNavy> oof
[1:44:48] <vingadivo> almost
[1:44:56] <@Solidus_113> @TheBigMuddy The puppy was conjured by Bedman to try and break Ram from being an emotionless doll and teach her a meaning of existing
[1:44:59] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Dorf1 yeah from from yeras ago
[1:45:00] <guymontag0> @carlioo Ram did a heel-face turn due to a combination of being treated nice, eating burgers, and giving a dog to care for. One of the bad guys in Xrd killed her dog to teach her a lesson.
[1:45:00] <@Solidus_113> you can tell it worked
[1:45:00] <+0wen2_> nago really is the baiken of this game
[1:45:01] <NotHereToStream> giovanna has alot of advantage on block, especially her overhead special
[1:45:01] <jetjagger222> lab punishes perhaps?
[1:45:01] <alephalpha> infil and infiltration are two different people
[1:45:02] <nailwind> its never your turn against Gio
[1:45:02] <DianaTheAscian> ooooo
[1:45:08] <Triplicat> if 260ms feels good to woolie the netcode is as good as it's gonna get
[1:45:13] <vingadivo> dash gives him blood right?
[1:45:15] <WarchiefGoldva> @WoolieVersus The bloodrage explosion launches the enemy, so it's a good idea to try and get in close as much as possible if you know you're gonna pop.
[1:45:15] <Vaunno> damn
[1:45:15] <brunoberserk> thats a looot of COUNTER
[1:45:19] <pajamarammaslamma> Ignore the high ping he's on good wifi
[1:45:19] <primaryfire> the jumping split-kick is + for her
[1:45:20] <NotHereToStream> her overhead special is advantage for her
[1:45:20] <mr_mister0> pressin pokes
[1:45:20] <drk_sd> cr p?
[1:45:22] <Jetsfantasy> Gio's thing seems to be "this is safe" the character
[1:45:27] <%JaseAdrift> She has some really good buttons
[1:45:28] <guymontag0> @vingadivo Yeah
[1:45:28] <Wild_Samurai> some Tenchu PS1 ass sound effects
[1:45:29] <+colbyninjas> she has that plus on block crossup
[1:45:29] <DianaTheAscian> very nice
[1:45:29] <raveous> oof, that was big delay numbers
[1:45:30] <Vaunno> iguazu PogChamp
[1:45:30] <%jepupu> Nagoriyuki seems pretty bad at anti air

[1:45:32] <inkthepeasant> PogChamp
[1:45:32] <+Patch_TheSquid> That kick is plus
[1:45:32] <KidKaiser23> Nago got hella range on his side
[1:45:32] <%Holycow8498> This game looks so god dam cool
[1:45:32] <leith_aziz> That's ROLLBACK

[1:45:40] <+McSoliace> rollback frames aren't delay
[1:45:41] <Vaunno> ROLLBACK BAYBEE
[1:45:42] <roarofdamnation> Dogos everywhere
[1:45:43] <marvel877> So, how many has Woolie won so far?

[1:45:44] <BlackermanZX> netcode is clean
[1:45:44] <leith_aziz> THANK YOU ZINAC

[1:45:46] <+Rafraud> Do PS4 sticks work?
[1:45:48] <xUrbanCarnage> That move is plus
[1:45:48] <+colbyninjas> magic ‚ú®
[1:45:49] <zer0enixx> Nago feels like a mid screen zoner
[1:45:50] <+MisleadingEchoes> Everything about GIO is safe
[1:45:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> @marvel877 lol
[1:45:51] <ullyzeez> has woolie won a game??
[1:45:56] <+solzan2000> ps4 controllers work
[1:45:56] <NotHereToStream> maybe you can react to the overhead with c.s?
[1:45:57] <Wild_Samurai> fighting all the American anime fans
[1:45:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gotta tighten up the buttons on combo 3 Woolie
[1:45:57] <Mibeador> you can probably 6P a lot of these jump ins on reaction cause upper body invincibility
[1:45:58] <LazyJustice1> Gio answer to "How plus is that?" Is just Yes.
[1:46:00] <pookam> video games are finally playable
[1:46:02] <spawnzie> The dark arts of Rollback Netcode
[1:46:02] <guymontag0> @woolieversus Gio‚Äôs flip can be air throw.
[1:46:05] <TatsuMakuu> how is it so far?
[1:46:07] <+almightychad> you can punish Gio's overhead but you need to stuff it with a button, on block it's plus
[1:46:09] <KidKaiser23> Nago only got one Anti-Air fr, two of you count his fat Golf Swing while in Blood Rage
[1:46:10] <TreeLeafBoi> Gio plus
[1:46:13] <+twohitgood> Montreal to Korea worked out?

[1:46:30] <+TheBigMuddy> @TheBigMuddy feelsgoodman
[1:46:48] <zer0enixx> I hope everyone starts playing this so other devs start taking ggpo seriously
[1:46:53] <BoxNavy> no :)
[1:46:53] <%JaseAdrift> playing a tanky boy gotta keep that mid
[1:46:55] <+CronomaruBlade> @woolieversus the rollback number isn't frame delay. it's the max number of frames the game will rollback
[1:46:56] <Triplicat> I thiiiiink waiting for a match in training mode is available in this beta still?
[1:46:56] <%johnny_gogo> at least its working
[1:46:57] <+MisleadingEchoes> nago is too high risk high reward
[1:47:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You'd probably get more bites on open beta weekend :c
[1:47:02] <juxtest> Other players are also standing around waiting for people to come to them
[1:47:03] <ullyzeez> nah they dont wanna play with a scrub

[1:49:31] <inkthepeasant> goddamn she's got DAMAGE
[1:49:33] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> Is the lobby system in this as bad as other arcsys games?

[1:49:43] <+PeaceCentennial> really small though
[1:49:43] <+someyounguy1> fun fact woolie probably knows, ramlethal speaks esperanto which is a constructed language, because she is a constructed being

[1:50:19] <Mattais88> Needing to pick up the swords manually and not have them as screenwide traps will take some getting used to

[1:50:36] <OblivionSword1> back to the Lab we go
[1:50:37] <KidKaiser23> Return to Lab
[1:50:38] <+mechslayer71> @myoomyoo NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:50:38] <+asgard147> Back to the Lab! limesCorn
[1:50:41] <Zayasu> damn congrats on 2k viewers woolie :)
[1:50:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Heal your wounds Woolie, get strong, then fight
[1:50:45] <Jetsfantasy> @PeaceCentennial So THAT'S how that works, I was wondering!
[1:50:45] <Wild_Samurai> save that online W/L record
[1:50:49] <%kyh9> Does Flash-step give you i-frames? Can you use it to dodge projectiles?
[1:50:49] <+OroOreo> we messed up, back to the lab again
[1:50:50] <%baka_sugoi> LABBING
[1:50:50] <Cosairen> @FairOnFire no rematch in btw
[1:50:51] <+superchronicc> back to the lab again, I messed up, back to the lab again
[1:50:53] <%gatorafan> @carlioo, completelly opposite to the shittalking AI the guys discussed in the podcast
[1:50:55] <+neoexogene> Yeah some lab‚Äôs needed
[1:50:58] <TehMud> Back to the lab again
[1:50:58] <DSD24> What's Ram's colors like
[1:50:59] <guymontag0> @faironfire Yeah, no rematch since Arc wants everyone to play each other.
[1:51:00] <wisconsinjoe> Back to the lab coneyGENIUS
[1:51:01] <@Menitta> heh I feel that every day
[1:51:04] <stevo_scar> @woolieversus checo out Kizzie for some Nago combos
[1:51:04] <+SvenHolgersson> YO THAT GIO COLOR
[1:51:06] <MKII> how'd those other guys get good so fast Kappa
[1:51:08] <+neoexogene> Hone your craft my dude
[1:51:10] <+lumporr> how's it feelin' so far
[1:51:11] <KidKaiser23> Can we see those Nago colors again?
[1:51:12] <kloj00> Need something for all that jumping
[1:51:17] <mr_mister0> you need to be a wall with Nago
[1:51:19] <zer0enixx> Who cares about the character exact race or ethnicity. As long as a variety of people can see themselves in characters, all‚Äôs good.
[1:51:20] <R0kushi> also fighting online its great to see where ur doing badly and try to fix it
[1:51:22] <+lumporr> wins/losses? any yet?
[1:51:22] <nailwind> Nago mains will use the excuse of ''I killed myself in neutral'' when losing
[1:51:29] <T_Sasquatch> Ah me. Spends hours in lab. Instantly forgets everything during the match
[1:51:30] <lazyagus> giovanna woolie
[1:51:33] <Vaunno> online continues to be scuffed
[1:51:34] <+mechslayer71> @lumporr he‚Äôs 0-3 online
[1:51:34] <+almightychad> do you, man, you good
[1:51:40] <guymontag0> No prob Woolie
[1:51:41] <Cosairen> @lumporr he's 0-5 iirc
[1:51:42] <LinxGG> its a process, we understand
[1:51:43] <samiscoolbro> I missed it Woolie got his shit push in online?
[1:51:44] <Garrett1405> Wait is Xrd Music in Strive?
[1:51:46] <+holliesthalo> in the end it has to be this way
[1:51:50] <+PeaceCentennial> @Jetsfantasy Yeah they added that in after the closed beta because people weren't wall breaking at all, since it would push people out of the corner and remove your ability to pressure corner wakeup
[1:51:53] <+lumporr> o no
[1:51:54] <+Davos_Southway> To be fair, Nagoriyuki is brand new, your going against people using their mains.
[1:51:55] <+PeaceCentennial> It's a very good change
[1:51:56] <bramblebird> training arc woolie!!
[1:51:57] <crimsonsaens> You gotta learn those safe blood rage set-ups
[1:51:58] <+saltpiggu> I think using back teleports as jukes is gonna be important for playing Nagori
[1:52:01] <+traximus_s> @samiscoolbro yes lol
[1:52:05] <Vaunno> @Garrett1405 a little bit ye, might be placeholders?
[1:52:05] <Mattais88> Is Gio just green there?
[1:52:06] <Danmaku2hu> wtf is up with giovanna???
[1:52:07] <+colbyninjas> shehulk gio
[1:52:08] <+almightychad> Nago is also super heavy so it's not easy to relieve pressure
[1:52:09] <+lumporr> is he cool tho
[1:52:11] <+awesomeguy423> Does ANYONE know if Sol still has his middle finger taunt?
[1:52:14] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Woolie the netcode looks good, in a guilty gear game, after playing xrd for hundreds of hours its so bloody good to see
[1:52:17] <Triplicat> safe blood rage setup is be next to them when it goes off lol
[1:52:19] <+solzan2000> gio stance doe Kreygasm
[1:52:19] <guymontag0> @garrett1405 There‚Äôs going to be a jukebox in the final game. And for some reason, Sol‚Äôs Xrd theme is the character select
[1:52:20] <stevo_scar> how much block stun?
[1:52:22] <Carlioo> gio's in she-hulk mode
[1:52:22] <zer0enixx> Thats bs they should leave the beta live until sunday
[1:52:23] <+Trimoon333> I thought the beta was tomorrow?
[1:52:25] <Cosairen> gio turns her dog color on full meter
[1:52:29] <LazyJustice1> Almost all of his stuff seems super unsafe. Exact opposite of Gio
[1:52:30] <Royal8383> all I hear is Come Together by the Beatles from this song
[1:52:33] <+Jrockoni> Swamp Gio looks rad
[1:52:35] <Neoxon> @woolieversus Is the English dub available in the beta?
[1:52:41] <Vaunno> broccoli giovanna
[1:52:46] <+awesomeguy423> @Neoxon no
[1:52:57] <+colbyninjas> damn she fast
[1:53:00] <+awesomeguy423> how the fuck does no one know if Sol has his taunt
[1:53:01] <inkthepeasant> i feel like nago's DP is gonna be really important
[1:53:03] <Neoxon> @awesomeguy423 Awww man, thanks for answering
[1:53:03] <zer0enixx> @royal8383 Same here but only at one specific point in the song

[1:53:12] <+NYCrownlessKing> hey woolie have u tried Quick RCing off normal or special during blood Guage delete to see if it cancels the entire mask animation? @woolieversus
[1:53:12] <ultimomouse> Isn't Nago's 5k a good poke?

[1:54:06] <neraren> Ah

[1:55:26] <+Dragon4234> Woolie betrays his own color
[1:55:28] <%ChoculaUltra> oh dope, GG Strive has an actual listing on Steam now. Coulda sworn they didn't have one last weekend.
[1:55:29] <crimsonsaens> @inkthepeasant It increases damage she deals
[1:55:30] <ElPlasa> So you have to almost Rekka the Sweep>DP>TP?
[1:55:31] <Cosairen> @inkthepeasant she get 10% more damage
[1:55:32] <ReadinRambo> Pat would play as soon as possible when there is Johnny
[1:55:36] <+almightychad> @inkthepeasant increases dmaage 10% at max tension, roughly 7% at 50% tension
[1:55:40] <+ScatterCatt> @DedlokPM Whenever I google it, it just gives me dates for the preorder date of the 17th.
[1:55:44] <+mechslayer71> They made Gio THICC Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:55:44] <%GingaNZ> looking good with the K
[1:55:47] <BigNerdSam> Is the Open Ball Testure out?
[1:55:47] <@chesterr01> try experimenting with 1) 214HS xx 623HS (1 hit) xx 236K, 2) f.S f.S xx 623HS, 3) f.S f.S xx 214HS xx 623HS (1 hit) xx 236K. Try to pick them up after with cl. S
[1:55:48] <inkthepeasant> ahhh cool cool
[1:55:52] <nailwind> mad dumpy
[1:56:06] <+lumporr> OOH
[1:56:07] <+Shishi1205> Big tips
[1:56:07] <@chesterr01> pick up with cl S or 5K
[1:56:17] <Crowroost> In Wooliiieee's Laaaaab
[1:56:19] <nailwind> reggie with the tech
[1:56:20] <KidKaiser23> Oooooooo
[1:56:25] <%ezgoldar> this sounds like heavy metal "come together by the beatles"
[1:56:25] <KidKaiser23> That was hot
[1:56:29] <Neoxon> Anything I should know as a prospective Nagoriyuki main? @woolieversus
[1:56:34] <bigshedman> LAB LIKE A TIGER PogChamp
[1:56:40] <juxtest> Put the boots to her
[1:56:42] <mandjelo> I like how the two characters you're labbing with are ZA WORLDO and Stando users.
[1:56:43] <krizzzfish> only 1 kick then 2H ?
[1:56:49] <Applecannon63> I hope maybe they give Gio a Beast Cannon in the next build of the game
[1:56:52] <DedlokPM> @DedlokPM try clicking on the official guilty gear wepage when googling guilty gear open beta rooDerp
[1:57:01] <ainda_> god that animation where he runs his hand along the blade is so cool
[1:57:09] <+konnakol> I hope they just give Gio more specials in general
[1:57:26] <+konnakol> Because that showcase was kinda disappointing ngl
[1:57:31] <%slayabee> Asked earlier, but is it possible to dash cancel the 2nd hit of your DP?
[1:57:35] <%JaseAdrift> but neither character are Za warudo...that's Axl
[1:57:35] <+almightychad> can you follow any of these combos with the command bite?
[1:57:39] <TigerClaws12> gio doesn't need more plus frames LUL
[1:57:42] <%ChoculaUltra> Nago is giving me Hakumen but with a self-destruct gauge vibe
[1:57:43] <guymontag0> Green booba Kreygasm
[1:57:47] <Saltmeisterr> his command grab seems really important for blood control
[1:57:56] <TigerClaws12> she can keep her amount of specials and sit in that corner
[1:57:56] <T_Sasquatch> Most of Woolies picks in a fighting game been super bad LUL
[1:58:00] <Crowroost> Dev on Ky bullying everyone in the videos BibleThump
[1:58:10] <Triplicat> there is no way 2H will work after 5K air juggle without RC
[1:58:12] <Carlioo> have they said if instakills are completely gone btw?
[1:58:14] <Triplicat> it's mad slow
[1:58:15] <%GingaNZ> 5H drops them right in front of you tho
[1:58:18] <%jaggstar2020> Wish every character had a unique tell for full bar.
[1:58:18] <+lumporr> that's tasty
[1:58:24] <Smitteys867> Do kick into that little sword uppercut
[1:58:26] <Saltmeisterr> @Carlioo Ky has DI
[1:58:34] <bigshedman> @T_Sasquatch It is now destined: Nagori will be both the boss character and bottom tier LuL
[1:58:38] <Saltmeisterr> wait i read that wrong lmao
[1:58:52] <Vaunno> @Carlioo we dunno yet
[1:58:54] <krizzzfish> anti air combos aswell
[1:58:59] <Ciglossonjr> @bigshedman so like Ramlethal an xrd?
[1:59:05] <KidKaiser23> @bigshedman But at least he won‚Äôt be Kotal Khan
[1:59:07] <+OroOreo> commmmmand grab
[1:59:11] <alephalpha> ^
[1:59:13] <guymontag0> There has been no confirmation if Instant Kills are in or not
[1:59:17] <+saltpiggu> bloodsucking universe
[1:59:19] <+almightychad> the bite is super
[1:59:21] <travelingwolfapples> yup that's the way
[1:59:21] <%GingaNZ> LETS GO SLAYER
[1:59:31] <vingadivo> man you're already a vampire tf do you need 2 swords for?
[1:59:33] <+wjones0415> or necalli
[1:59:33] <WarchiefGoldva> @WoolieVersus Maybe if you get blocked, dashing back with teleport can give you some space, or warping in can lead to grab mixups?
[1:59:35] <Crowroost> Who else is hype for the 15th character being Literally Akuma Again
[1:59:39] <+someyounguy1> gotta use that mira mindset of gettin your blood
[1:59:43] <+samuraiskitz> roman cancel
[1:59:43] <crimsonsaens> RC
[1:59:45] <+sc0rezer0> RC after command grab?
[1:59:47] <guymontag0> I remember there was a time when Ram was one of the best. Then the 1.1 patch happened.
[1:59:47] <vingadivo> NOT THE HEADBITE
[1:59:48] <travelingwolfapples> can you rc?
[1:59:54] <+saltpiggu> you gotta rc
[1:59:55] <KidKaiser23> Get it out the Mud, Suck the fvckin Blood
[1:59:57] <TrashLeviathan> rc the grab
[1:59:59] <alephalpha> after a command grba you cna spend some blood and still be enagtiv eblood pusle
[2:00:00] <+OroOreo> @Crowroost that would actually be so tight to me
[2:00:02] <damnyell_> did I see that right, you can dash upwards?
[2:00:03] <SolomonMcMan> I‚Äôm really looking forward to what a hyper-aggressive Nago looks like
[2:00:03] <+samuraiskitz> you can rc the command grab
[2:00:07] <+transporterthesequel> He knows chat
[2:00:08] <+almightychad> could probably spam more specials after the bite too
[2:00:15] <T_Sasquatch> How aren't you writing stuff down ?? I have a note pad open whenever i play. LUL
[2:00:18] <+sc0rezer0> What if they see it and jump? What options then?
[2:00:34] <%GingaNZ> this stage is real nice
[2:00:46] <%Solid_Stro> Quickly zipping in for a grab when they‚Äôre blocking seems like a strategy that some people are using.
[2:00:47] <+saltpiggu> can you Bloodsucking Universe into Bloodsucking Universe like slayercould?
[2:00:52] <Vaunno> loving the statue rockets in the back
[2:01:20] <%ChoculaUltra> @T_Sasquatch I always keep a stack of post-it notes and a pen stuck on my hitbox when I start new fighting games LUL
[2:01:25] <+transporterthesequel> Maybe get some back teleports in for 5s bait?
[2:01:26] <+OroOreo> hol up
[2:01:27] <Cosairen> tatami gaeshi
[2:01:30] <velgaduere> Like Baik
[2:01:33] <Crowroost> I paused the latest CSB podcast in the middle of talking bout dognut and now it's weird to look @ Giovanna's pupper
[2:01:55] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Is the PS5 version available at launch? I recently got burned by Little Nightmares
[2:01:55] <%GingaNZ> 5K maybe?
[2:01:57] <stormhawk9891> @Crowroost You can't escape
[2:01:58] <$arcielardor> reminds me of Silver Samurai
[2:02:02] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie already cheating on nago in his mind with his old flame Kappa
[2:02:04] <%johnny_gogo> Clone?
[2:02:05] <+sc0rezer0> Sweep into teleport mix?
[2:02:19] <Equirah> Capcom took too long to do Asura's Wrath 2 so Arcsys just made it the bg of a stage LUL

[2:03:58] <%neroforte177> @saladin1911 i wasnt thinking about it but now that you mention it
[2:03:59] <KidKaiser23> @binaryfireball Same reason why Nago points his sword at the opponent
[2:04:11] <@Solidus_113> if you notice it's on block could you dash again and do the command grab?
[2:04:17] <%saladin1911> I'm gonna have to tread those waters carefully smh
[2:04:20] <%BinaryFireball> @KidKaiser23 is this like that butt battle anime?
[2:04:22] <MKII> @BinaryFireball the butt distracts, while the dog attacks
[2:04:29] <nailwind> Keijo Kreygasm

[2:05:47] <NotHereToStream> can you interrupt giovannas overhead with that anti air
[2:05:51] <TreeLeafBoi> @hojynn I mean...
[2:05:51] <+Sendaar> I feel like you either gotta go real slow samsho shit or full unga bunga fuck the blood meter
[2:05:57] <+LordAngry> microwalking seems really big in catching your combos from what I've seen so far
[2:06:00] <+Sajallday> I've seen kizzie anti air with 5K as well
[2:06:16] <Carlioo> does he just eat dango for his taunt
[2:06:24] <Cosairen> onigiri
[2:06:30] <+neoexogene> Oh nice they got that Linkin Park rapper
[2:06:34] <KidKaiser23> I thought your Anti Air was that Double Slash where you swing up and down
[2:06:38] <Carlioo> ah didn't get a good look
[2:06:40] <CoffeeKaiju> my spine is shattering just looking at giovanna's pose
[2:06:50] <Triplicat> 2H MAD slow
[2:06:54] <+awesomeguy423> my dick is shattering just looking at giovanna's pose
[2:06:54] <+colbyninjas> imagine if they got lotus juice for this game Kreygasm
[2:06:56] <NotHereToStream> c.s?
[2:07:01] <Vaunno> spines are for losers
[2:07:05] <+almightychad> slappy slaps
[2:07:09] <sir_nack> upper body invuln boys
[2:07:09] <nailwind> Giovanna is a gesture drawing come to life
[2:07:13] <jubejube56> I think I saw some kind of Nago palm thrust also beat it out
[2:07:17] <+neoexogene> @colbyninjas don‚Äôt give me this hope
[2:07:18] <Carlioo> who needs spines when you have doggo
[2:07:20] <NotHereToStream> how about close slash?
[2:07:20] <%saladin1911> This man needs to chill out lmfao
[2:07:22] <Vaunno> invertebrate gang
[2:07:24] <%Solid_Stro> coxBut
[2:07:26] <+Jrockoni> man is it me or does daisuke really sound like bootleg shinedown
[2:07:42] <cheap_turbo> RC?
[2:07:49] <+colbyninjas> I don't think he's the singer
[2:07:52] <+neoexogene> @coffeekaiju Get as mad as you want at that spine, you can‚Äôt unfatten that ass tho
[2:07:59] <+awesomeguy423> he's not the singer
[2:08:02] <+awesomeguy423> it's the guy from Xrd too
[2:08:18] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> I just got here, has he left training mode?
[2:08:18] <damnyell_> @cheap_turbo roman cancel
[2:08:22] <+Jrockoni> I thought he still did the music himself
[2:08:24] <Danmaku2hu> I think he's worrying too much about the blood gauge build up
[2:08:29] <+awesomeguy423> @Jrockoni he composes it
[2:08:31] <+awesomeguy423> doesn't sing it
[2:08:36] <+awesomeguy423> idk if he writes the lyrics either
[2:08:38] <%saladin1911> So chat, how was Valentine's for y'all? I slept through most of the day then played Yakuza 4 so was pretty good
[2:08:41] <Vaunno> @A_DEAD_SHOW ye, but online gives connection errors, rollback to japan is solid tho
[2:08:42] <Ciglossonjr> Doesn‚Äôt Daisuke voice Sol?
[2:08:45] <+awesomeguy423> no
[2:08:46] <CoffeeKaiju> @neoexogene to be fair i do wish i too had an absolute DUMP TRUCK...
[2:08:47] <+awesomeguy423> he used to
[2:08:48] <%neroforte177> are people really complaining about Gio's stance. Children please
[2:08:52] <Ciglossonjr> Ah rip
[2:08:53] <+awesomeguy423> he voiced Sol until +R
[2:08:58] <+colbyninjas> he did voice sol in the original games
[2:09:01] <Saltmeisterr> its a weird stance
[2:09:07] <+awesomeguy423> he voices Sol in the best GG game
[2:09:07] <+neoexogene> @saladin1911 was pretty nice for me ! My GF got me 13 Sentinels for valentines !
[2:09:09] <+awesomeguy423> so that's all you need
[2:09:13] <+KillMyPast> Imagine complaining about Giovanna but not Millia
[2:09:19] <Vaunno> 13 PogChamp
[2:09:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:09:21] <+MisleadingEchoes> Woolie is using controller? Wow why
[2:09:25] <Nekros4442> wait why are you using pad woolie?
[2:09:25] <Arek_1> The shame pad.
[2:09:28] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> The plague of big thumbs
[2:09:32] <Applecannon63> Everyone complaining Gio's stance don't have problem with Mai from KoF's stance
[2:09:33] <eldragon_1> Sol‚Äôs voice is the Hellsing Alucard VA
[2:09:35] <CoffeeKaiju> whos mad
[2:09:39] <Cosairen> or you know like pot being a nine foot tall walking tank mad
[2:09:42] <%neroforte177> imagine complaining about anime characters
[2:09:45] <NotHereToStream> Joji nakata
[2:09:51] <Vaunno> imagine complaining
[2:09:52] <Jetsfantasy> Fair nuf
[2:09:54] <%saladin1911> @neoexogene Nice!! You been watching the LP or were you holding off?
[2:09:55] <+colbyninjas> I wonder how the dub will sound
[2:10:03] <+neoexogene> I‚Äôm a stick player but ngl GG is super comfortable on pad as well
[2:10:05] <Triplicat> I played melty blood for like 5 years on pad
[2:10:07] <KidKaiser23> @meta_yoroitoshi Big Thumb Baddies, Stan Up!!!
[2:10:10] <fringespider> Just saying I don't like grabs where its a direction + button. Any advice on how to get used to it?
[2:10:13] <%SirGO0SE> i know that feels
[2:10:13] <bigshedman> Are they even gonna bother with a dub after Xrd?
[2:10:14] <Triplicat> I can't play that game on stick even after learning stick
[2:10:15] <Vaunno> hope its better than Xrd dub, as fun as that was
[2:10:16] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus does nago have any tiger knees or comparitively complex inputs to get used to. that you could find anyway
[2:10:17] <+MisleadingEchoes> Stick on GG makes stuff a lot easier with RC mapped in the third button
[2:10:20] <Bayomycry> Can you test if his command grab takes blood away per time or if its a fixed ammount during a period of time?
[2:10:22] <sir_nack> 4 button fighters work fine on pad
[2:10:27] <%saladin1911> I'm a keyboard warrior woolieF
[2:10:28] <Bazal68k> ArcSys games have pretty great Pad layouts.
[2:10:44] <%zanzibar_junker> I have bad wrists to play stick
[2:10:48] <Octocon> you using BBC dpad? @WoolieVersus
[2:10:54] <Vaunno> GG on 8 button Kreygasm
[2:10:57] <+neoexogene> @saladin1911 I really wanted to continue the LP but I started getting really into it and wanted to experience it for myself, so I got maybe 11 parts-ish into it before dropping the LP
[2:11:01] <damnyell_> Zato on pad sounds like a nightmare
[2:11:05] <TreeLeafBoi> Nago's grab game is nice
[2:11:13] <+MrAtheGreat> Hey @WoolieVersus How's Nagobiyuki treating you?
[2:11:24] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus does nago have any tiger knees or comparitively complex inputs to get used to. that you could find anyway
[2:11:26] <+MisleadingEchoes> I think Faust is unplayable on Pad maybe
[2:11:27] <Vaunno> beautiful
[2:11:27] <Ciglossonjr> I really love Nago‚Äôs little spin
[2:11:27] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @KidKaiser23 lytCIAO I see you lmao

[2:11:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at this point my hands would be too sweaty to play more
[2:12:00] <+MisleadingEchoes> More than anything woolie will need to learn how to deal with projectiles with nago
[2:12:04] <Vaunno> Woolie VS Connection Errors
[2:12:05] <TreeLeafBoi> Now do it
[2:12:12] <TreeLeafBoi> In a real match
[2:12:19] <Applecannon63> Twitch the fuck
[2:12:21] <%saladin1911> @neoexogene Good call tbh. The LP is great, but that game is all about the discovery so if you're gonna play it at all, you've gotta do it fresh. Have fun!
[2:12:21] <+lumporr> is there fun haptic stuff?
[2:12:25] <+lumporr> or will there be?
[2:12:30] <GoldeNOVA> UI design is the best it's ever been, goddamn

[2:12:46] <%jepupu> Oh boy
[2:12:47] <+MisleadingEchoes> @GoldeNOVA people are complaining about the UI yet. I think it looks good.
[2:12:51] <Jetsfantasy> It must feel pretty decent if you can't be bothered to switch out pads
[2:12:53] <%Solid_Stro> How does the game feel on the PS5 controller?
[2:13:00] <OldManDeckardCain> oh hey, it's that ram player

[2:13:17] <+neoexogene> @saladin1911 Thanks buddy ! I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm gonna have a great time having my brain get melted by the twists lmao
[2:13:20] <Applecannon63> The Old Build UI was so bad
[2:13:24] <Saltmeisterr> kinda wish there was more setplay characters often than Zato

[2:13:26] <velgaduere> woolhaus
[2:13:35] <+MisleadingEchoes> @awesomeguy423 I disagree I think the Menus look really good, but I think it's more taste than use

[2:13:48] <Triplicat> if they do a feedback survey again the 2nd thing I'm gonna write in it is to make the RISC meter bigger
[2:13:49] <Vaunno> oh lawd we rollin
[2:13:50] <Triplicat> 100%
[2:14:01] <+colbyninjas> thank God the lobby is optional
[2:14:03] <%Solid_Stro> Damn Ram woolieOMG
[2:14:07] <+neoexogene> I got used to the UI honestly, it think it fits the whole reworked aspect of the game itself
[2:14:13] <%JustToWatch> Is Woolie still in Japan lobby?
[2:14:13] <+MisleadingEchoes> @colbyninjas depends on the mode. In this beta it isn't
[2:14:14] <alephalpha> @Saltmeisterr I feel you I'm an I-no player and rams now a compeltely different character and millias ability to loop oki is far weaker

[2:14:38] <Vaunno> Xrd UI also changed a ton between Sign and Rev 2

[2:14:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> save us rollback

[2:19:10] <+mechslayer71> This is the same guy LI had a rough match with btw @woolieversus this guys an issue, it‚Äôs him
[2:19:11] <+Xero_J> I've seen matches go across US to France with very few hiccups, so this is intriguing, to say the least
[2:19:13] <ImChilliP> I was too distracted by Ram‚Äôs kO pose
[2:19:19] <+asgard147> What if he ACTUALLY is Slayer tho? limesThink
[2:19:20] <wolfmanfocus> oh yeah more combos Woolie
[2:19:21] <+ExceedSC> @WoolieVersus the stream was dropping mad frames during the lag in game, idk if there was an issue on your side

[2:19:51] <mandjelo> Fear the red bars
[2:19:53] <Picia000123> Getting Golden Frieza flashbacks here
[2:19:53] <%slimmixrp> Man that üÖ±lood burst is killer
[2:19:54] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> the stream was going stupid when you were having those rolls
[2:19:54] <Royal8383> Is I-no gonna make it?
[2:19:56] <+McSoliace> the rollback fixed that match
[2:19:56] <+sc0rezer0> Slayer is inside a Nagoriyuki mech like Kum Haehyun
[2:19:57] <Ice_Ventura549> do or do not, there is no try
[2:19:59] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus lilbussyman wants to fight
[2:20:00] <+MrAtheGreat> might want to consider instant zan-ing to kill that blood rage
[2:20:03] <wolfmanfocus> go for it
[2:20:07] <ainda_> damage is so high in this game it seems like the life drain isnt that big a deal unless you're giong from above 50% to bleow 50%
[2:20:07] <mirtosss> stream died for a lil there
[2:20:08] <%jaggstar2020> take my energy

[2:20:19] <%Chatterbox1991> so the Rollback Works?
[2:20:21] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You dropped a shitload of frames on stream, so it wasn't the netcode shitting the bed, it was your entire connection
[2:20:21] <MKII> yeah stream dropped frames do it must have been on your end
[2:20:26] <KidKaiser23> Is your Bullshit Blazing or No? That‚Äôs the game plan
[2:20:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> it was
[2:20:27] <+spardanwarrior> Stream shat the bed for a second when the lag was going crazy
[2:20:29] <Crowroost> anyone else feel that Ram's win animation is half-finished? like hardcore "just a mouth moving" budget anime at teh end of it
[2:20:29] <+neoexogene> Lil Bussy Man LUL

[2:21:56] <+neoexogene> Oh yeah Rams are the new Brazilian Ken
[2:21:56] <+MrAtheGreat> That blood rage is really devestating if t pops at the wrong time
[2:21:59] <floralkami> @thatscricri hopefully they push for more PS4 sales in the meantime, cause that PS5 shit is still ridiculous.

[2:34:42] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> yeah, @WoolieVersus , the matches that have been rough have been you, which is the unfortunate part.
[2:34:43] <floralkami> Woolie, someone's downloading big GG Lores on your connection

[2:47:26] <%Mrbaconator> GARBAGE LOBBY
[2:47:28] <+thackattack00> this lobby is so fucking bad holy shit
[2:47:32] <Picia000123> I cannot wait for a basic ass screen with play game
[2:47:33] <velozity> "GGs @WoolieVersus but you gotta stop trying to get people into fighting games and get back into training mode"
[2:47:34] <nailwind> lets get some Millia
[2:47:34] <BlackermanZX> Fuck this lobby
[2:47:38] <Lancaster_H> this interface is atrocious
[2:47:38] <floralkami> @lavrohas iirc, the lobby is optional
[2:47:39] <yuribo26> Arcsys had the best lobbies, why did they do this
[2:47:40] <+Hayajin_> uh it's thanks obama
[2:47:42] <+MisleadingEchoes> They should just stop with this lobby garbage seriously
[2:47:43] <Triplicat> this is KoreanWrestlingMan

[2:48:24] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Jesus
[2:48:24] <Crowroost> Hypothesis: the CEO's child/wife/etc thought the lobby was a cute idea and not it's hardlocked in
[2:48:29] <enerkaizer> How big does everyone think the chance is for ArcSys to just remove that lobby and and use instead just a "Play ranked-button"? Because this looks like borderline unfiable
[2:48:29] <RocketBarrel> Just have a predetermined area people can stand on where fights initate and it'd be so much better
[2:48:29] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> rare peter griffin

[2:50:14] <Jetsfantasy> @Icer107 "I have it at 5 rollback frames and I felt NOTHING resembling a problem" - Woolie about an hour ago
[2:50:16] <vingadivo> beaten by dex build
[2:50:20] <TigerClaws12> damn he didn't even name drop woolie LUL
[2:50:21] <+mechslayer71> @woolieversus that wasn‚Äôt real, check the Twitter
[2:50:24] <%ChrisBardow> over 200 ping looks rough

[2:50:47] <+b_aleph> and slashy
[2:50:47] <+justacrow84> man they really nailed Millias design in Strive
[2:50:50] <TopTierHarley> 5K 2D Disc isn't real
[2:50:50] <+moonxbearx> fuck it woolie its guity gear week lets get it lol
[2:50:51] <BackwardCap> Nago's teleport doesn't go through characters?
[2:50:56] <nailwind> give bandai the run back
[2:50:56] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Obama going on a rampage on twitter right now
[2:50:56] <+TheBigMuddy> @shmupdogjoe its yrc now
[2:50:57] <sir_nack> @shmupdogjoe no but you can RC during hitstun and it works similarly
[2:50:59] <BigNerdSam> Watching the rollback made me preorder
[2:51:07] <+BillHicks5051> The Ducking is real
[2:51:11] <%shmupdogjoe> during *hitstun*?
[2:51:14] <enerkaizer> The general opinion seems to be "Rollback good, but please burn this pixel-lobby nonsens"
[2:51:16] <%shmupdogjoe> wouldn't that make it more like a burst
[2:51:18] <Arek_1> @Solidus_113 LUL
[2:51:18] <XfourtwoX> Meanwhile Max spended 70% of is stream on Lab Kappa and when he started to play with people online, oops, beta was over
[2:51:19] <Gutsandlove> on brand with namco
[2:51:26] <sir_nack> @shmupdogjoe sorry, blockstun
[2:51:26] <shnorkk> @WoolieVersus Just got here and I'm sure you've been asked a bunch already - but what do you think of the lobbies?
[2:51:28] <ozmon> Obama did just tweet this though: I dont know if it is real or just an urban myth, but they say if influencers turn the lights off, look in the mirror & say "lil bussy man" 3 times fast, an Axl player with incredible footsies, game sense, (somehow) setplay & game vision will appear on the top floor of their tower
[2:51:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:51:29] <dustyjordans> @WoolieVersus "I dont know if it is real or just an urban myth, but they say if influencers turn the lights off, look in the mirror & say "lil bussy man" 3 times fast, an Axl player with incredible footsies, game sense, (somehow) setplay & game vision will appear on the top floor of their tower"
[2:51:30] <%shmupdogjoe> oh okay
[2:51:32] <+moonxbearx> i think hes playing chipp right now
[2:51:35] <%saladin1911> I REALLY hope that the PC version gets full crossplay since that's where I'm grabbing it
[2:51:39] <%phd_in_thuggery> @woolieversus he just dropped it
[2:51:39] <+BillHicks5051> These battle lobbys give me flashbacks of 3rd grade PE where people are picking teams
[2:51:40] <TopTierHarley> @shmupdogjoe it's during blockstun, you do a RC
[2:51:43] <$arcielardor> Get Into Training Mode would be a good name for a segment where Woolie trains Little V into a contender.
[2:51:43] <vingadivo> man this is like the worst lobby ever, the 16bit shit doesn't even fit the rest of the game
[2:51:44] <Triplicat> oh it's Oga!
[2:51:44] <%Mrbaconator> ape together strong
[2:51:46] <Crowroost> Can't justify pre-ordering till I see PC gameplay... I've been hurt before BibleThump
[2:51:47] <Triplicat> this is a vtuber!
[2:51:47] <+o_almighty_1> You can search the lobby for individuals I believe
[2:51:49] <@Solidus_113> @saladin1911 it won't for a while

[2:54:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> don't invoke his wrath
[2:54:09] <enerkaizer> question: I've seen many people play Nago, and by the looks of it he seems either way to slow or he doesn't do enough damage per combos. Did I see this right?

[2:58:15] <puluxor> Hey Woolie, enjoying fightan games? Much love
[2:58:16] <MBDiana1> How's the statshaming working?
[2:58:17] <%baka_sugoi> FOOTSIES like SLAYER
[2:58:18] <Applecannon63> nah thats a power geyser
[2:58:27] <+alphonseisbest> so the trash lobby is the games only problem?
[2:58:32] <countgaculatv> Is the beta open for preorder now or is everyone playing in a closed beta right now?
[2:58:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:58:35] <MassConnect> I totally forgot I could chat
[2:58:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> tbf Woolie is in the Killer server.
[2:58:44] <viewtifulr> Can woolie look at dogs right now after pat came at him?
[2:58:45] <Applecannon63> lobby is impractical
[2:58:46] <+almightychad> animal brain too strong
[2:58:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> !memes
[2:58:47] <+yeknomlive> dmg is a little high too
[2:58:49] <+sargewha> the lobby system still seems obtuse
[2:58:49] <Scyllas> Samsho mode Woolie.
[2:58:52] <rcand9> lmao theres just a dude in a wife beater walking round the lobby
[2:58:52] <TopTierHarley> @countgaculatv this is influencer day, tomorrow is pre order day

[2:59:12] <TopTierHarley> PogChamp
[2:59:13] <WingedBalmung> we are losing Majin to Babidi
[2:59:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Love me Some Cornera
[2:59:14] <Triplicat> whiff 2H get shot
[2:59:14] <+yeknomlive> I'm set on ram
[2:59:16] <countgaculatv> Majin Obama's thumbnails are crazy lmao
[2:59:18] <%HeroToxiko> less unga more Facefisted
[2:59:24] <Crowroost> Every time?
[2:59:27] <MassConnect> what's the recap: woolie picked character for aesthetics or for playstyle?
[2:59:35] <+b_aleph> Man it's so fucking sick when she pins you to the wall
[2:59:35] <+Rafraud> Does the Positive mean next hit will be +?
[2:59:37] <Triplicat> LOL
[2:59:39] <+black_pariah> are the regular lobbies open or no
[2:59:39] <countgaculatv> @MassConnect Looking a bit of both
[2:59:40] <%Afterman_> @MassConnect yes
[2:59:41] <+MrAtheGreat> Full@meter man
[2:59:42] <timorales43> good read LUL
[2:59:43] <sir_nack> it seems like they managed to preserve ram's whole thing of shoving you into the corner, pleasantly surprised after how dull her starter guide looked
[2:59:43] <+Parrish_broadnax> im gonna hate not seeing this till april
[2:59:43] <+almightychad> this ram knows the exact moment to throw you
[2:59:44] <delerim001> that move is the no bro
[2:59:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that Ram super is really good
[2:59:48] <SoromopsDucky> I love how Nago laughs as he dies
[2:59:57] <Man_in_the_Red> aestetics, you can tell from doing nuetral grab instead of the untechable command grab
[2:59:57] <KidKaiser23> He be waitin for you to jump in
[2:59:57] <Applecannon63> Power Geyser
[3:00:00] <junkiedolemite74> Is the beta available already?
[3:00:01] <therealtacopancakes> is my man Reggie playing at home too?
[3:00:07] <+PridetheSaint> she's got those swords
[3:00:08] <TigerClaws12> yea her projectiles are so hard to see
[3:00:09] <+Shishi1205> That seems really good
[3:00:11] <+NYCrownlessKing> can Nago teleport dash to avoid the sword projectiles?
[3:00:12] <Crowroost> Every time.
[3:00:12] <+PridetheSaint> never misses
[3:00:13] <+DisigmaSama> @Rafraud Positive bonus is a tension boost
[3:00:17] <%Afterman_> @junkiedolemite74 atm only for influencers. tomorrow ios ppl who preordered and day affter is for all
[3:00:17] <nailwind> she actually recovers those swords fast
[3:00:18] <+b_aleph> ram is fucking awesome
[3:00:18] <%saladin1911> The most disappointing thing about Ram is that she covers her abs now psaWrong
[3:00:19] <Kyanta_Rojo> Nago seems to struggle with movement so yeah getting out of a corner seems hard
[3:00:20] <Saltmeisterr> are those projectiles unblockable?
[3:00:22] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Can you command dash through them?
[3:00:22] <+moonxbearx> ram good as hell and people were crying :o
[3:00:24] <Thunderhog> Ram's a corner beast if you're just under pressure
[3:00:26] <TopTierHarley> can't burst when you get wall splatted
[3:00:29] <ikantreeed> @WoolieVersus random question! best Internet provider in Mtl? moving soon and planning on streaming
[3:00:31] <+TopTieramisu> is that god damn kotomine's voice
[3:00:34] <Triplicat> they are most definitely blockable
[3:00:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> can Nago teleport dash to avoid the sword projectiles? @WoolieVersus
[3:00:35] <+Joe2187> nothing left to drain
[3:00:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> DENY IT
[3:00:35] <Sulliman34> rammy is kinda nuts
[3:00:36] <countgaculatv> Can't wait to get Strive on PC and mod clothes onto RamLethal
[3:00:36] <+snickers_md> do ram normals have a hitbox?
[3:00:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> throw more Woolz
[3:00:37] <junkiedolemite74> Tyvm afterman
[3:00:38] <Cosairen> wait ram doesnt have sharp teef no more.. terrible redesign
[3:00:43] <%ChrisBardow> Is there a gab between sword projectile hit into explosion?
[3:00:44] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> The startup on that spin goes through projectiles
[3:00:44] <+almightychad> she's grabbing you on that teleport every time
[3:00:45] <+PeaceCentennial> Nago's big advantage is range but she outranges you
[3:00:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> finally Ram is good again
[3:00:47] <%Afterman_> @junkiedolemite74 np :) game looks super fun
[3:00:47] <shurtal> ah, the ancient war of Big Sword vs. Two Big Sword

[3:00:52] <+Parrish_broadnax> I like how weird Nago's Model slides when Ram wins
[3:00:57] <+NYCrownlessKing> can Nago teleport dash to avoid the sword projectiles? @WoolieVersus ?
[3:00:59] <%ChrisBardow> Maybe block the 1st hit then cmd dash through?
[3:01:00] <+Ornightz> Lab then come back
[3:01:03] <+queaks> Where does Nago fit in the lore?

[3:01:20] <Kyanta_Rojo> @Cosairen Ram's sharp teeth were always contextual. She didn't have them in Rev either cause her smile changed due to the personality change.
[3:01:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Cosairen I think she still has them in some story cutscenes they showed in trailers

[3:06:09] <%HotSnake1989> HotSnake1989 subscribed with Prime.
[3:06:10] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, playing lame seems to be really good against bloodsword
[3:06:11] <velgaduere> Return to UNGA
[3:06:11] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus u probably need to corner carry into blood rage pop
[3:06:13] <%drefizz> Wait is Kill supposed to be Bruno from jojo?
[3:06:14] <ikantreeed> Let's go LAB!!!
[3:06:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> ü¶ßü¶ßü¶ß go ape
[3:06:16] <+Drega707> Is Woolie on a stick or pad?
[3:06:16] <Crowroost> Thus starts the "switches to Leo eventually" arc
[3:06:18] <+almightychad> Nago has no degenerate moves, he's too honest
[3:06:18] <mr_sups> MajinObama talking you up on Twitter
[3:06:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you gotta become monke Woolz
[3:06:24] <ikantreeed> Did woolie lab on stream?
[3:06:24] <BlackermanZX> gotta find a good way to get in
[3:06:24] <Omarequiem> Is that a Kiryu Nago avatar? LUL
[3:06:25] <randominternetsurfer> @woolieversus yo Woolie, Max is about to hop on. any chance you might play with him?
[3:06:27] <%baronblank> obviously we don't have much time with him yet but nago seems kinda bad which sucks
[3:06:30] <nailwind> show pure reckless stupidity and it'll shake their morale
[3:06:32] <+Grayhammatter> return to monke woolie
[3:06:41] <Applecannon63> Nago isn't bad he is risky
[3:06:46] <KidKaiser23> Walk it out, Woolie!
[3:06:49] <BourneWarrior> Nago has TOO MUCH Honor
[3:06:52] <ullyzeez> @baronblank there are some players that can make him look scary af
[3:06:55] <ainda_> literally not even day 1 and people already think they know the tier lists lol
[3:06:56] <MBDiana1> they can't predict your moves if you also have no idea what youre doing
[3:07:00] <+Shishi1205> Nago needs time
[3:07:02] <Solidnick18> okay
[3:07:05] <%HitmanBillson> oh teh double throw haha
[3:07:09] <Jetsfantasy> I feel Nago just needs some time to find tech and etc
[3:07:10] <fringespider> @WoolieVersus can you RC the blood rage activation?
[3:07:12] <Picia000123> Nago probably ain't completely bad, but boy he seems like a struggle all around
[3:07:12] <+Parrish_broadnax> the blood demand it
[3:07:12] <rcand9> holy shit theres a counter for rollback frames at the top PogChamp
[3:07:14] <morningmoondude> the johns are real
[3:07:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nagoriyuki is an honest character and that's bad
[3:07:20] <MutedMimic> SourPls
[3:07:26] <%saladin1911> @ainda_ Exactly lmao. I kinda hate that shit
[3:07:36] <fjpara> Did Ky's lightning change color or am I losing my mind?
[3:07:45] <inkthepeasant> goddamn ky is sauced up in this game
[3:07:45] <BoxNavy> sheesh
[3:07:48] <Saltmeisterr> @fjpara it did
[3:07:53] <+sc0rezer0> This is like watching a lion play with a mouse
[3:07:53] <himbearbedtime> no oxygen
[3:07:53] <Sulliman34> weird that ky doesnt have grinders anymore
[3:07:54] <Applecannon63> Honest = Bad from people
[3:07:57] <Saltmeisterr> it used to have an icon too
[3:07:57] <quamdunk> Damn this game looks guuuuud
[3:07:58] <Bluewolf544> Ky is a lot cooler now
[3:07:59] <%HitmanBillson> so much of Nago's buttons are slow too
[3:07:59] <Cosairen> @fjpara nah its definitely blue in xrd
[3:08:01] <velgaduere> BUT SLASH GOOD
[3:08:03] <%SouLucha> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:08:05] <Chimeraelite> boots
[3:08:09] <fringespider> @WoolieVersus can you RC the blood rage activate?
[3:08:10] <ullyzeez> hey woolie i wanna see ky's dragon install bring the health down a bit more bud
[3:08:12] <Rhinoprotoss> 5K
[3:08:12] <+CashewZero> Nago looks so damn slick
[3:08:20] <Applecannon63> don't press the wrong button
[3:08:24] <th3_gaming_dumb> dude needs a slight buff to the gauge
[3:08:29] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> "probably"
[3:08:31] <KidKaiser23> @ullyzeez Lmao
[3:08:38] <Jetsfantasy> That might be just what you need though
[3:08:39] <+Ben_VC> you can't rc blood rage confirmed
[3:08:39] <+NYCrownlessKing> never say never woolie @WoolieVersus could work with quick rc
[3:08:40] <fringespider> imagine if you could tho
[3:08:41] <+zetaplus> @fjpara it was blue a few months ago. wierd it's yellow now
[3:08:42] <fringespider> broken af
[3:08:45] <+NYCrownlessKing> who knows @WoolieVersus
[3:08:47] <+sc0rezer0> Blood rage activation burst seems safe on block
[3:08:47] <NegaFightr> no you can't l
[3:08:47] <%HitmanBillson> well even spending 50 bar to make it faster would be dope
[3:08:48] <+jemeeks> Try more 5K
[3:08:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> are you ready kids?
[3:09:06] <Xelhesia> is the beta available on pc?
[3:09:10] <%Calenrow> can the bloodrage activate midair or midcombo? or does it always wait for next neutral grounded opportunity to go off
[3:09:12] <Crowroost> Nago's a honest lil snapping turtle in a roster full of coked-up wolverines.
[3:09:16] <+Jakev91489> The rushdown is REAL
[3:09:21] <nailwind> Nago is a sitting duck most of the time
[3:09:22] <%Buttface_> kizzie???
[3:09:27] <Jetsfantasy> Rushdown Ky is insane looking
[3:09:27] <%HitmanBillson> yo that crossed!?
[3:09:28] <vingadivo> i imagine this is what a dark souls boss feels like when they fight some twink with a katana
[3:09:37] <ullyzeez> mashing throw lmao
[3:09:40] <sir_nack> god kizzie makes ky look so scary
[3:09:46] <+neoexogene> Kizzie is a fucking BEAST
[3:09:48] <%paladinstarbuster> letting him control the pace
[3:09:53] <Laveyrin> Kiz is playing for keeps
[3:09:53] <Chimeraelite> perhaps throwing out Ks would work better than throwing out Ss?
[3:10:00] <+Shishi1205> 0 Potempkims chips and Fausts huh?
[3:10:01] <morningmoondude> HE DO IT
[3:10:04] <+almightychad> I wonder if you could bait that throw with a back teleport into stab, might be too slow
[3:10:20] <ullyzeez> gg
[3:10:25] <KidKaiser23> Woolie using the slide like that to move out the way was pretty slick
[3:10:28] <TheVoltStrike> wow he recovered really fast from the spin lunge
[3:10:29] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:10:30] <GalacticLatte> @Shishi1205 I saw a few Fausts on Maximillians stream
[3:10:33] <+Parrish_broadnax> Chip~
[3:10:36] <BoxNavy> so mask off auto activates right?
[3:10:41] <himbearbedtime> Ky has so many weapons against that
[3:10:41] <ullyzeez> "oh no my blood!"
[3:10:41] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Was Nago growling just then?
[3:10:41] <+TopTieramisu> weak to chip
[3:10:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> Got some good hits in tho
[3:10:44] <vingadivo> i haven't seen a single Faust
[3:10:47] <Bluewolf544> But the chip tho
[3:10:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> wool is Spain and the S is silent
[3:10:49] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> nago be like "oh im winning? no i'm not"
[3:10:53] <capt_kenn> @WoolieVersus is Nago living up to thhe Black Excellence we expected of him?
[3:10:59] <+TopTieramisu> spain speko
[3:11:05] <Cosairen> yeah lets not forget that kizzy is one of the best gg players in the world

[3:12:22] <Gadlight> @WoolieVersus i wish he was called Darius Rose tho, that would be perfect
[3:12:23] <%urthwind> Personally I want Zappa, Robo-Ky and A.B.A., but there's already a handful of characters I like
[3:12:25] <KidKaiser23> Baiken players buy her jus to fill their roster
[3:12:25] <MrGuy516> Liking the netcode?
[3:12:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> Baiken """"Mains""""
[3:12:27] <Laveyrin> baiken will be in the game like year 2

[3:14:08] <+b_aleph> cant be him
[3:14:09] <winner_92> why are fighting games so opposed to creating a button that says "play" that just matches you up with someone
[3:14:10] <velgaduere> let's GO
[3:14:16] <rcand9> Obviously
[3:14:18] <Jetsfantasy> @drefizz A few, yeah

[3:14:31] <guymontag0> @drefizz Jmcrofts and Majin Obama plays him
[3:14:31] <+TopTieramisu> this lobby design is absolutely perplexing

[3:14:45] <+TopTieramisu> is this some interstellar shenanigans?
[3:14:46] <Jetsfantasy> Persona 4 vibes with KLK
[3:14:47] <MBDiana1> is this faust's gamer cube?
[3:14:47] <Bluewolf544> This stage looks like a reference to jojo part 8 wonder of u

[3:17:03] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Can 6P beat out Grees Sever?
[3:17:04] <nailwind> Nago needs them hard reads
[3:17:06] <Chimeraelite> Boot
[3:17:07] <Gadlight> i think you need to play a bit more patient with Nago, he is like a Samsho char in a GG game
[3:17:08] <+JumboCrunchies> I've never really played GG, why is everyone playing Ky?
[3:17:08] <%paladinstarbuster> and mix it up
[3:17:09] <Ultimatefool> @WoolieVersus Did that match feel good? Over 100 ms lag woof
[3:17:14] <+b_aleph> Man, I can't play this game, if Woolie's getting his ass kicked I won't be able to land a strike

[3:23:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> has he played gio yet?
[3:23:33] <Crowroost> "That's A Lot!"
[3:23:35] <+noajenkk> oh, neat
[3:23:39] <sparked963> Gotta use that meter
[3:23:47] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus Hes fighting Razer computer accessories
[3:23:48] <+mechslayer71> I wanna see some Nago colors
[3:23:50] <NotHereToStream> that neon colour is nice
[3:23:51] <Toni_Master43> @OneThousandTomatoes He tried her for like 15 minutes in the lab
[3:23:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @maku_tree np, seems like Max was labbing her so check his stream if you wanna see it in more detail
[3:23:57] <MKII> he's playing on a Razer stick I bet
[3:23:59] <Sulliman34> that one blockstring created half blood gauge
[3:24:01] <+volkmardeadguy> max is running gio right now
[3:24:03] <Applecannon63> the jokes got overboard to quickly
[3:24:03] <SoromopsDucky> He...He¬¥s applying things he learned in the Lab!! Impossible!!
[3:24:07] <Saltmeisterr> black plus a primary bright color will never not look good
[3:24:08] <BoxNavy> sucks that no one is playing nago so you could learn some shit
[3:24:13] <%SirGO0SE> zato looks hella fun

[3:24:28] <maku_tree> @kosorsomesaykosm_ atpNinja
[3:24:28] <+VVardy> People aren't really using RCs, is there a reason why?
[3:24:29] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> i feel like the blood meter should have grey life because its hard to gauge it mid match
[3:24:30] <+fantaman917> Blazgreen looks like an amazing Zato player
[3:24:31] <%Buttface_> gotta AA with 6A more, not just 2H

[3:26:39] <BoxNavy> everyone in this game is hot
[3:26:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> damn
[3:26:52] <Limes528> @vingadivo Axel is a time traveler in the story
[3:26:54] <jetjagger222> even faust
[3:26:58] <+Birdigalore> THE PRESSURE
[3:27:00] <velgaduere> good shit tho
[3:27:00] <raveous> this looks like a tough matchup lol
[3:27:04] <rocket_da_madman> does this version of zato have the hold the buttons commands
[3:27:05] <pepinillomaton> The damage in blood rage tho, I guess you gotta get with a poke mentality into it
[3:27:06] <vingadivo> oh got it
[3:27:11] <BoxNavy> @jetjagger222 especially faust
[3:27:12] <%unclekulikov> damn zatos and their bluegrass music
[3:27:16] <+MTLxSpider> @rocket_da_madman yes
[3:27:17] <+noajenkk> yo the blood heat oki
[3:27:21] <Cosairen> every matchup agasint zato is hard look at this pressure
[3:27:23] <Vaunno> i-no can also time travel, put her in and give HER time stop
[3:27:24] <%ChiRithy> ChiRithy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! I'm playing 3s with the guys while we're waiting for Strive to come out. You're more than welcome to join us!
[3:27:26] <+noajenkk> revolutionizing the game
[3:27:26] <+Hacerous> wow the stagger tho
[3:27:28] <xUrbanCarnage> 2H is NOT a great anti air
[3:27:29] <+comet_mage_15> @WoolieVersus Hello, I see that the main 3 gatlings in this game seem to be K->D, P->P, and S->HS. If it's not a bother, would you be so kind as to tell me if there are others, perhaps ones that are character dependent? Thank you for your time
[3:27:32] <zk_nails> this blood mechanic seems rough
[3:27:36] <+fantaman917> Zato is a tough character to learn, but once you do, he looks nigh unstoppable
[3:27:36] <+MTLxSpider> Blazgreen is Rynge
[3:27:39] <jetjagger222> zato is the boss character of GG
[3:27:41] <Saltmeisterr> at least the blood rage pop guard crushes
[3:27:41] <Crowroost> L I P S
[3:27:42] <+Hacerous> i wonder if you can meaty using the blood rage..
[3:27:43] <rocket_da_madman> @MTLxSpider i see
[3:27:49] <Raffacakes> I only watched your first GuiltyGear lore vid, is Zato the one who abused his wife, one of the beasts, or was that someone else?
[3:27:52] <Applecannon63> blood mechanic is good but risky
[3:27:54] <+noajenkk> @Hacerous its probably mad minus
[3:28:01] <+mechslayer71> You guys see the way Nago lays down when he loses? LUL
[3:28:07] <Vaunno> he slayer
[3:28:07] <Toni_Master43> Good zatos are always scart
[3:28:08] <DrFuzzyPanda> I can see Woolie loving giovana
[3:28:10] <Toni_Master43> scary*
[3:28:10] <JayEarly> @raffacakes I think Mila was his girlfriend but yeah
[3:28:11] <+Hacerous> i think it staggers on block tho..
[3:28:13] <Vaunno> vampires can't die
[3:28:14] <+Hacerous> hmm
[3:28:15] <Applecannon63> Nag is reverse Sin
[3:28:18] <rocket_da_madman> just like slayer
[3:28:20] <ullyzeez> yo how can max go on training mode and still get matches?
[3:28:20] <+noajenkk> i mean its worth testing
[3:28:21] <Cosairen> vampires just wanna have fun afterall
[3:28:22] <Solidnick18> yoooo blazgreen69 lmao
[3:28:26] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Seems like like the bloodrage stops loosing health once you get low enough, Carmine comparisons?
[3:28:27] <+VladVandal> u know I was lookin mechslayer
[3:28:31] <Toni_Master43> @ullyzeez you can matchmake in training
[3:28:33] <thetopazking> @mechslayer71 he is a vampire so this is him playing around like slayer
[3:28:35] <anuchallengertwitch> I hope to make my own work of fiction with hype shit in it one day
[3:28:40] <GenericSoda> Nago seems like a puzzle. He feels like he shares more DNA with Robo-Ky than with Sin
[3:28:42] <nailwind> eight gates of Nago
[3:28:44] <seycheles> CoolCat
[3:28:45] <BoxNavy> CiGrip

[3:29:02] <Raffacakes> @JayEarly oh right cool
[3:29:02] <DedlokPM> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels it gets slowed when at low hp, but only stops at pixel hp
[3:29:03] <anuchallengertwitch> @GenericSoda Reminds me more of Hakumen to me
[3:29:03] <sir_nack> nice, using command grab
[3:29:08] <Cosairen> overheaded
[3:29:09] <Vaunno> mf jinxed himself
[3:29:23] <jetjagger222> yeah even his helmet kinda looks like hakumen
[3:29:24] <+b_aleph> woolie, remember to stfu
[3:29:26] <sweetestbeefs> i looked away for a second and the match was over lmao
[3:29:29] <GenericSoda> @anuchallengertwitch I don't have any real BB experience so I can't really make that comparison
[3:29:32] <pepinillomaton> Man this pressure
[3:29:35] <+noajenkk> good mash
[3:29:40] <+Hacerous> GOD DAMN THIS GAMES OST IS NICE!
[3:29:46] <Vaunno> SAYONARAAAA
[3:29:47] <KaironFortressKnight> Dont forget that RC while blocking is kinda like an alpha counter
[3:29:47] <+o_almighty_1> I‚Äôm just a scrub but after a bite, I‚Äôd be going iiiiin üòÇ
[3:29:48] <DedlokPM> @OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels or whenever the duration of the buff ends, whichever comes first
[3:29:50] <Bullethead1010> How's it going woolie?
[3:29:51] <+o_almighty_1> It‚Äôs go time
[3:29:56] <+o_almighty_1> Blood in the water
[3:30:08] <rocket_da_madman> nago is a bleach reference???
[3:30:14] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> isnt that 3rd command slash unsafe?
[3:30:16] <jetjagger222> looks like it
[3:30:20] <GenericSoda> Zato's 6H is a problem
[3:30:22] <T_Sasquatch> another thing i considered is , paying 60 bucks for a fighing game as a complete noob is such a big ask
[3:30:23] <+Realignment3> I wonder who the least used character is so far
[3:30:27] <+Hacerous> ty for streaming woolie
[3:30:29] <+noajenkk> LMAO
[3:30:29] <ullyzeez> those colors are hot are fuck

[3:30:34] <anuchallengertwitch> @GenericSoda there both masked samurai characters who are more defenseive and punish based than most of the cast. They can also get stupid damage as compensation. Plus both are some of the strongest characters lorewise

[3:37:02] <JayEarly> anyone finding success with Nago? his disadvantages seem kinda extreme
[3:37:03] <+Hacerous> wtf was that? bitch slap?
[3:37:06] <MichaelOfCainhurst> Fear the Old Blood. By the Gods, Woolie, fear it.
[3:37:08] <townzzzzz> where's the grand vipering
[3:37:15] <Saltmeisterr> needs more boot
[3:37:20] <+ATRodger> Blazing
[3:37:24] <jetjagger222> @JayEarly yeah he seems to suffer from kotal khan-itis
[3:37:25] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie seems like the only person playing Nago
[3:37:27] <TigerClaws12> @townzzzzz Kizzie's not RS Kappa
[3:37:33] <Vynith> god this game looks sick
[3:37:48] <nailwind> I haven't seen many Nago's and they haven't been successful either :(
[3:37:52] <ullyzeez> @jiggy_snipe yea now that you mention it he hasnt found anyone else
[3:37:53] <floralkami> @jayearly if Gio is the beginner friendly character, it feels like Nago was made for the vets to really test themselves.
[3:38:01] <thetopazking> @jetjagger222 hes complex so many are probably not ready
[3:38:02] <Cosairen> surprised theres not been a run up wild throw yet
[3:38:07] <thepardack> it's early in the game. I'm sure Nago will become more popular as people get their hands on the game.
[3:38:12] <rocket_da_madman> blood in blood out
[3:38:16] <%RVMSpeedWagon> fear the old blood
[3:38:17] <+Birdigalore> FEAR THE BLOOD, LAWRENCE

[3:38:24] <+Geograffy> Embrace the blood
[3:38:26] <Crowroost> CHORES: THE CHARACTER
[3:38:26] <MichaelOfCainhurst> FEAR THE OLD BLOOD
[3:38:27] <winner_92> nago looks difficult but you get to do some sick shit if you play it right
[3:38:27] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> FEAR.....THE OLD BLOOD
[3:38:28] <Vaunno> FEAR THE OLD BLOOD
[3:38:28] <sweetestbeefs> can you spend the blood?
[3:38:30] <SoromopsDucky> You¬¥re LITERALLY Nagoriyuki
[3:38:31] <Applecannon63> chat this day 1 are you expecting for woolie to master Nago
[3:38:32] <Scyllas> Fear the Old Blood.
[3:38:33] <Solidnick18> oooh
[3:38:33] <Iphantom99> Nago looks kind of struggle
[3:38:33] <raveous> Fear the old blood Darlington!
[3:38:34] <%SouLucha> Woolie refusing to pick a top tier and going for the content rather than the wins.
[3:38:36] <%TubeMan642> what's that smell?
[3:38:43] <%TubeMan642> ITS BLOOD
[3:38:44] <+Shin_Mando> Blood is such a meta to have to metigate.
[3:38:45] <Vaunno> smells like blood in the water
[3:38:46] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> nago is the most high honor, high risk character
[3:38:47] <Applecannon63> High Risk
[3:38:47] <%CptnCampy61> Fear the old blood
[3:38:50] <raveous> by the gods fear it
[3:38:50] <%fakeburg> The smell of blood....MAKE A MAN GO CRAZY woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG
[3:38:54] <BoxNavy> right now, nago seems more trouble than hes worth.
[3:38:55] <ullyzeez> lmao woolie really wanna play like this huh
[3:38:55] <nailwind> it's enough to drive a man crazy..
[3:39:03] <Cosairen> can you combo into command grab?
[3:39:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Reduce the blood!
[3:39:05] <Chimeraelite> maybe treat the blood and getting in as more of an attack in and of itself?
[3:39:06] <+Grayhammatter> fear the old blood, but also embrace it
[3:39:06] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus blood pop guard crushes so remember that
[3:39:12] <kinggum41> is it up on ps4?
[3:39:12] <Freddy253> nago is a faith based character you have to believe in yourself.
[3:39:13] <Darlos9D> you know if your blood is that high you can probably try and get close on purpose so they get hit by the activation. I'm not sure you're supposed to look at blood mode as a full blown lose condition
[3:39:24] <WakeUpThrow> Reminds me of Arthur losing his armor in MvC3 NotLikeThis
[3:39:24] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Ah....the scent of the blood....its enough to drive a hunter sick
[3:39:26] <+Geograffy> nice
[3:39:26] <Iphantom99> ooh Ram
[3:39:32] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Since getting a PS5 is nigh-impossible still, would you recommend waiting, getting the PC version or the PS4?
[3:39:35] <zhenthrim213> my girl Ram
[3:39:37] <thepardack> gotta combo into that blooooood
[3:39:38] <%SouLucha> Nago is ShamSho, just gotta be patient and control your lust FOR BLUD
[3:39:39] <+mechslayer71> Be it his fighting game character choices or his channel choices, woolie always chooses the path of perpetual torment.
[3:39:40] <nailwind> blood mode is full on kill or be killed
[3:39:41] <Applecannon63> Nago is for those who don't have bitch in their heart
[3:39:43] <TrashLeviathan> ram PogChamp
[3:39:45] <+MrAtheGreat> Yeah, blood fine but you gotta hit those hits imo
[3:39:45] <devilrnaycry> 24 hour nago stream
[3:39:51] <ullyzeez> woolie wants to keep losing lmao
[3:39:51] <sleeskee> Ram-chan bsapriThreat
[3:39:54] <+Jiggisnipe> the blood hits so combo into it is good
[3:40:05] <BoxNavy> fuck
[3:40:09] <Applecannon63> losing is not bad it can be fun
[3:40:10] <MKII> one of the good rams
[3:40:15] <Vaunno> BRUH
[3:40:16] <nailwind> LUL killer
[3:40:17] <countgaculatv> Nago is for people who only listen to one Metallica song
[3:40:17] <BlackermanZX> YUP
[3:40:19] <sweetestbeefs> OH GOD
[3:40:21] <Crowroost> Collecting an alphabet full of Ls before switching off Nago
[3:40:21] <+Grayhammatter> jesus, a kller
[3:40:23] <Picia000123> To be fair, the only way to learn is to lose a lot, so I respect Woolie sticking with Nago
[3:40:26] <ainda_> oh thats a sick winpose
[3:40:27] <%ekodrop> same ram as earlier
[3:40:29] <Darlos9D> heck even on block the blood activation seems to blow back guard
[3:40:29] <xUrbanCarnage> @ullyzeez u probably trash
[3:40:31] <sweetestbeefs> that wasnt even 20 seconds...
[3:40:32] <nailwind> this ones a mass murderer
[3:40:34] <Picia000123> Even though Nago looks real rough
[3:40:36] <JayEarly> i dunno why they put a red hot chili peppers song in this but i dig it
[3:40:42] <jetjagger222> have confidence
[3:40:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[3:40:48] <+Geograffy> Is today early press access?
[3:40:50] <BlackermanZX> This one has a body count doodWat
[3:40:55] <sweetestbeefs> losing makes lessons!
[3:40:55] <Danger_douglas> is it just me or is Woolie's audio way louder than the game?
[3:40:56] <floralkami> @aishman it's a fighting game, so it's more important to play on something you feel you will get the most matches. so PS4 is your best bet (PS5 of you got it, they have crossplay)
[3:40:56] <nailwind> LUL okay th is guy PLAYS guilty gear
[3:40:59] <boros_user> woolieSPICE
[3:41:01] <%SouLucha> Visions of Sonicfox's Ram, yeah she's looks great bois!
[3:41:03] <thepardack> god the negative penalty in this game seems crazy
[3:41:09] <%ken_kuma> @WoolieVersus What's your opinion on Giovanna?
[3:41:09] <+Jiggisnipe> influencer access Kappa
[3:41:12] <sweetestbeefs> remember, take the L also means take the LESSON
[3:41:13] <BoxNavy> no its not :)
[3:41:19] <leto_ii_muadibadder> dinklebeanO7
[3:41:20] <GenericSoda> CorgiDerp
[3:41:20] <Darlos9D> I feel like he jumps in a lot
[3:41:21] <Kokobang> did they remove the big "counter" text when it happens?
[3:41:23] <+unhuggable1> oof
[3:41:25] <Freddy253> dont be afraid
[3:41:28] <Darlos9D> I don't know if you're supposed to jump in a lot
[3:41:32] <+Birdigalore> Damn boi she thicc boi!
[3:41:32] <daddyscumeez> @Kokobang certain counter hits will do BIG COUNTER
[3:41:33] <kinggum41> ramLETHAL
[3:41:33] <ullyzeez> yes his jump ins suck
[3:41:34] <JayEarly> puppy!
[3:41:37] <capt_kenn> you can do sliding RC tho right? @WoolieVersus \
[3:41:40] <BoxNavy> you missed a gigantic AA opportunity that fight
[3:41:41] <lemon_lover28> a bunch of these win quotes seem off?
[3:41:44] <Kokobang> @DaddysCumeez oh, I see
[3:41:47] <+desfore> The big counter hapens occasionally, but most of the time it's much smaller
[3:41:52] <BlackermanZX> i dont think jump ins are the right call
[3:41:54] <floralkami> @woolieversus why not use your pop as a tool to get in? it should be safe on block cause it send your opponent reeling back
[3:42:03] <Darlos9D> like with nago I really feel like my Pot experience will apply, where I just focus on being a grounded slow moving wall
[3:42:05] <+RiceeFTW> fight fenritti
[3:42:07] <pepinillomaton> I guess you have to not be scared of the blood and go all in so the activation counts as a hit too?
[3:42:09] <Iphantom99> Ram seems good, I'm happy
[3:42:13] <stabbityrabbit> What's the point of not going all in at low health? You don't go below one health, and you might equalize the playing field in the meantime. Did I miss something Woolie tested earlier about that?
[3:42:19] <Timothyer> so glad Nago is the cool big button samurai people always seemed to want Baiken to be. Now she can be her best self.
[3:42:23] <MichaelOfCainhurst> nice
[3:42:26] <SunsetJack> Super is unsafe also.
[3:42:38] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> You play him like an actual samurai
[3:42:42] <sweetestbeefs> they need to buff nago
[3:42:44] <nailwind> s o c i e t y
[3:42:46] <+unhuggable1> oh man
[3:42:46] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Learning him will teach you bushido
[3:42:49] <DingusMcBaseball> oh shit
[3:42:51] <pepinillomaton> But the normals tho
[3:42:53] <jetjagger222> haven't fought potemkin yet?
[3:42:57] <sweetestbeefs> give him super armor or some shit
[3:42:57] <%LastHazzerd> you have ONE special move
[3:42:57] <R0kushi> they probably will between the beta and release
[3:42:59] <Vaunno> I feel like they'll tone down the thirst meter a bit
[3:43:03] <bigshedman> Can't you pop that special move you get access to that instantly ends blood-mode?
[3:43:04] <Sulliman34> that shit is unburstable???????? gross
[3:43:07] <nailwind> 60%
[3:43:08] <R0kushi> these player matches will all aqcuire data
[3:43:19] <+Birdigalore> Now she has to get AND SHE GOT THEM
[3:43:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @stabbityrabbit you can only walk and forward jump as far as getting in goes during blood rage, plus you gotta do it when it's actually safe, so can't just unga at will
[3:43:24] <floralkami> I mean if you're already going into Blood rage, there's no point in trying to step back and get space. your opponent is gonna punish it if they have that space
[3:43:27] <+ATRodger> evoPerfect
[3:43:30] <+Jiggisnipe> can you combo off the blood rage?
[3:43:30] <jetjagger222> nago's combo timings seem to be extremely predictable
[3:43:30] <+Radkon> Thursday can't come soon enough NotLikeThis
[3:43:36] <jetjagger222> so you're easy to punish
[3:43:43] <sweetestbeefs> remlethal is fuckin bonkers holy shit
[3:43:44] <capt_kenn> I'm surprised I'm not seeing Ram player do the reversal very often
[3:43:44] <thepardack> @bigshedman It's a super, if you don't have meter you're gonna have to lose all that hp
[3:43:45] <kinggum41> God Ram's design is so much better now
[3:43:53] <+egalitarian696969> Svampen is best jack-o
[3:43:59] <winner_92> woolie has so much more mental fortitude than me dude goddamn
[3:44:01] <RudeRabbit> I mean, this dude is floor 10, so yeah, he's a KILLER
[3:44:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Ram is in the wheelchair no longer
[3:44:04] <+kenyr> How people THIS good this early???
[3:44:04] <BlackermanZX> this ram takes no prisoners
[3:44:04] <Dave_VD> @floralkami I agree. If you're gonna pop then might as well go in
[3:44:05] <MikeyxStyles> you gotta go a lil more unga
[3:44:05] <valentine_cyphre> no vore Intro tho
[3:44:06] <+Birdigalore> Don' fear the blood, Woolie!
[3:44:08] <xUrbanCarnage> Gotta Anti sir these scared jumpers
[3:44:08] <bigshedman> @thepardack Ah, gotcha.
[3:44:12] <Merlander_> Them buttons do be slow
[3:44:13] <Solidnick18> ram kinda nice
[3:44:17] <LokiValentine> She got a cute Dog tho
[3:44:18] <%Rhythmaxed> Rhythmaxed subscribed at Tier 1.
[3:44:21] <nailwind> this man is out for blood
[3:44:22] <MikeyxStyles> embrace the blood sometimes
[3:44:23] <sweetestbeefs> ACT BEFORE THINKING
[3:44:24] <Saltmeisterr> lol what if this is SonicFox
[3:44:26] <+RiceeFTW> FENRICH
[3:44:27] <Merlander_> SonicFox was doing work with Ram earlier
[3:44:33] <nailwind> CAN WE GET THE BOY GENIUS?
[3:44:34] <+PersonifiedTFT> its not sonic lo
[3:44:35] <+Radkon> Afk?
[3:44:38] <+RiceeFTW> pain
[3:44:41] <Saltmeisterr> okey
[3:44:43] <YoTobimoto> "just defend" will make stuff more punishable
[3:44:45] <Triplicat> there's no point in mashing interact on people who aren't in ready (green) state because you can't challenge them if they aren't ready
[3:44:46] <floralkami> @thepardack true, but those pokes become 20% chip on block, so there's little reason to not go all out.
[3:44:46] <ExpressNode> I don't know why the lobby music reminds me of some fire emblem pre-map music
[3:44:48] <JayEarly> Ram traded in her weird gimmicks for being a good character
[3:44:49] <Saltmeisterr> then how is this guy?
[3:44:50] <winner_92> NAGO MIRROR Pog
[3:44:50] <stabbityrabbit> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ I understand, but if you go in pre-rage you should already be in position right? Then you can try and get something started with a jab up close.
[3:44:52] <R0kushi> MIRROR
[3:44:53] <+Jiggisnipe> finally

[3:45:58] <+aishman> @DaddysCumeez I mean the community for one. Can't play a fighting game without people to play with
[3:45:59] <killaholic89> Y‚Äôall can‚Äôt really be telling yourselves Nago is bottom 1 Lol
[3:46:00] <jetjagger222> take it
[3:46:02] <+Radkon> That anti air is nutty
[3:46:03] <Iphantom99> he literally lost because of that
[3:46:04] <+Grayhammatter> we take those
[3:46:05] <floralkami> @aishman PS4. you'll have more matches sooner.
[3:46:06] <Hammatime8> Yeah, CLUTCH that!
[3:46:07] <TrashLeviathan> ps4 would most likely have a bigger pool to play in
[3:46:08] <GenericSoda> I have no idea if you meant to max your blood gauge, but it was a really smart call in the end
[3:46:08] <Man_in_the_Red> PS5 if you can manage to get a friggen console, otherwide just go PC, they'll attempt to add crossplay assuming Sony plays nice for Not Fortnite
[3:46:09] <BlackermanZX> scuffed but we take those
[3:46:09] <rocket_da_madman> why woolie backed away LUL
[3:46:10] <daddyscumeez> @aishman so literally nobody will be on PC then?
[3:46:11] <DDDorsett> PS4 since people actually exist
[3:46:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @stabbityrabbit true yes, but it's easier said than done it seems. You gotta fight two opponents - the opponent and the blood bar at all times, very finnicky
[3:46:12] <+DisigmaSama> Something about that red mask
[3:46:15] <Gadlight> catJAM catJAM SAYONARA
[3:46:22] <%TubeMan642> Black On Black lets Go
[3:46:23] <nailwind> this fucking hibiki shit with clones
[3:46:30] <velgaduere> COU-C-CO-COUN-COUNTER
[3:46:33] <+ATRodger> Is Woolie playing on stick or pad?
[3:46:34] <+aishman> @DaddysCumeez Based on the responses from here, the vast majority will be on console. Since PS4 and PS5 will have crossplay
[3:46:36] <Vaunno> pad
[3:46:36] <sir_nack> oh shit another nago
[3:46:37] <TrashLeviathan> we samsho now
[3:46:37] <Cosairen> pad
[3:46:38] <KidKaiser23> That color is fvckin hot
[3:46:38] <chll0ne> pad
[3:46:39] <+thackattack00> @aishman anime fighters pretty much always have bigger populations on console, playstation eespecially
[3:46:42] <%R4dishh> R4dishh subscribed with Prime.
[3:46:52] <Shinji2015> There's no crossplay with PC, so PS4/5 would be the better choice
[3:46:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Im you but better
[3:47:00] <floralkami> @aishman it won't be coming to PC for a while, so best to get it on Ps4 now if you wanna play *now*
[3:47:01] <GenericSoda> I'm grabbing it on PC, maybe I'm an outlier
[3:47:02] <+aishman> Thanks guys, appreciate ya'll
[3:47:03] <Equirah> @aishman ps4 will have crossplay with ps5 at launch, they're trying to get crossplay with pc but with no promisses
[3:47:06] <thepardack> Nago SPEEN
[3:47:12] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> projectile into command throw seems like a real good option for slow ass characters
[3:47:14] <nailwind> mans punishing a lot
[3:47:15] <Picia000123> I can only grab it on PC, so there is no choice for me
[3:47:18] <Timothyer> I like this Sith costume
[3:47:29] <nailwind> give em that Naoto Kurogane slash
[3:47:31] <pepinillomaton> That was the moment to punish
[3:47:32] <+BillHicks5051> is Arc Sys gonna have patch out all of the Option selects?
[3:47:33] <floralkami> @picia000123 same :(
[3:47:34] <Saltmeisterr> ah no punish
[3:47:36] <Triplicat> PC launch is simultaneous with console; the early access for console deluxe edition does not count
[3:47:37] <+b_aleph> Well, at least Nago won a match...
[3:47:39] <+PersonifiedTFT> woolie he was wiide open you could have killed him right there
[3:47:42] <thepardack> is it possible to combo blood burst hit to zansetsu??
[3:47:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:47:43] <+Birdigalore> So thats what Nago's win screen looks like
[3:47:44] <Reveresao> I'm not going to lie I misread the stream title
[3:47:45] <+CarrowayFashonti> I don't know if anyone else had made the joke yet, but Blood for the Blood God
[3:47:45] <MichaelOfCainhurst> no punish on bloodrage
[3:47:46] <+volkmardeadguy> i thoguht the super had to hit to go out of rage i guess its just use it
[3:47:46] <sweetestbeefs> YO THAT WIN SCREEN
[3:47:47] <countgaculatv> Woolie I see you wasting your bar on defense. You should be saving them for RCing
[3:47:49] <%saladin1911> I'll be on PC too. I'm a keyboard player because pad just feels awful for FGs to me
[3:47:51] <+BillHicks5051> Nago is kinda trash?
[3:47:53] <KidKaiser23> If only Woolie caught him during the Pop
[3:47:53] <shotgang86> Wooooo many views Darlington doing fine tonight
[3:47:54] <sweetestbeefs> thats so vergil shit
[3:47:57] <th3_gaming_dumb> he was balancing very good and using alot of normals
[3:47:57] <pepinillomaton> hey man seems difficult
[3:47:58] <Hammatime8> Damn, I didn't realize his mask was THAT cool!
[3:48:02] <DianaTheAscian> oooo the green eyes
[3:48:05] <Manchips> Hey woolie I just came in from the majin Obama tweet I‚Äôm sorry you were rejected from floor 10
[3:48:06] <Crowroost> Nago's facial hair looks so much better on taht color wtf
[3:48:10] <+mechslayer71> Nago only competitive against Nago BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[3:48:15] <Applecannon63> Nago is not trash he is highrisk
[3:48:15] <+unhuggable1> nope
[3:48:16] <+Jiggisnipe> we don't know yet, it's a beta but he seems hard
[3:48:18] <SpookyMooks> ggs dude
[3:48:19] <nailwind> this is a painstaking character
[3:48:20] <BlackermanZX> def not free at all
[3:48:20] <+Hayajin_> the new baiken
[3:48:20] <+Sajallday> it's a learning process
[3:48:21] <+Jiggisnipe> it's alot of work it seems
[3:48:22] <Saltmeisterr> he's definitely no
[3:48:24] <+Joe2187> Try GIOVANNA
[3:48:24] <Picia000123> Nago is struggle inc.
[3:48:24] <%drefizz> he really isn't, hes pretty dope thou
[3:48:27] <BlackermanZX> also its a new character of course
[3:48:27] <+kenyr> Has he fought a giovanna yet?
[3:48:29] <ullyzeez> best nago in the world lets go
[3:48:31] <+Birdigalore> Give it a month or so into release and I'm sure Nago will be fire once folks know how to play him
[3:48:32] <@Menitta> aw I come back
[3:48:32] <+Sajallday> but it seems worth learning
[3:48:36] <sweetestbeefs> he's way harder than any other character right now
[3:48:38] <BigNerdSam> Nago is $Not-Free.99 USD with tax
[3:48:38] <+b_aleph> Like Potemkin?
[3:48:41] <+unhuggable1> yeah the movement restriction is oooof
[3:48:44] <+mechslayer71> @kenyr yeah, he got washed
[3:48:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nago said no scrubs allowed
[3:48:45] <kinggum41> so it's Darli again
[3:48:49] <%ECRead> I play Pot.
[3:48:49] <@Menitta> oh cool still goin
[3:48:50] <Julbot1> NAgo is playing a different game than everyone else.
[3:48:50] <+BillHicks5051> So Nago is trash
[3:48:50] <pepinillomaton> You gorra be godlike with your spacing and range
[3:48:53] <Triplicat> longpanda is another Korean player IIRC?
[3:48:53] <Iphantom99> I'm tryna press half screen buttons for free tho
[3:48:53] <blackjackskellington> How you likin Nago so far?
[3:48:54] <%jaguarkek318> he takes a good week to get down I feel
[3:49:02] <Shinji2015> Nago has a lot of the same issues as Onimaru in Fantasy Strike, it seems
[3:49:02] <%DaRoosta89> blanka.
[3:49:05] <TrashLeviathan> nago is darli 2.0
[3:49:09] <HeyImBode> That's GG tho, half the cast doesn't belong w/ the rest :P
[3:49:11] <Palmtuna> It doesn't really seem like its something you can lab out either
[3:49:13] <ullyzeez> @kinggum41 and kotal and neccali
[3:49:13] <%jaguarkek318> just cuz his spacing is vital
[3:49:16] <nailwind> nago is the enkidu of this game
[3:49:22] <Timothyer> I mean this is a lot of GG characters: playing their own game.
[3:49:24] <countgaculatv> Woolie you're spending a lot of bar on FDing.
[3:49:26] <Xelhesia> how do we play the beta i cant find it on psn?
[3:49:30] <Vaunno> bro he kinda IS enkidu
[3:49:30] <+Birdigalore> Yeah don't give up on him, Woolz
[3:49:36] <BourneWarrior> Nago= $Free,Nienty Nien
[3:49:36] <+Hayajin_> max doing quick play and no one is showing up
[3:49:39] <mihokspawn> Does Potemkin have an air Dash?
[3:49:41] <el_sloth> when's the revenge against Obama
[3:49:43] <Vaunno> @Xelhesia if you preordered, it starts tomorrow
[3:49:43] <kinggum41> The cool characters are always bad NotLikeThis
[3:49:48] <+b_aleph> Maaaaan, can you imagine if they add Testament to the game? Nago wouldn't win a single match against that
[3:49:55] <+Radkon> Realized I haven't seen nago's dust attack yet
[3:49:57] <+BillHicks5051> Ill just wait for Ephelt
[3:49:59] <Xelhesia> @Vaun0x thanks
[3:50:02] <Vaunno> np
[3:50:05] <ullyzeez> woolie you need to use the super as a DP i see you getting pressured so much
[3:50:09] <AhmCha> Axl is the character that worries me the most in this game
[3:50:09] <Picia000123> Axl things
[3:50:12] <Saltmeisterr> @BillHicks5051 DansGame
[3:50:20] <+CarrowayFashonti> THAT READ
[3:50:22] <th3_gaming_dumb> why
[3:50:24] <JayEarly> so my strategy of starting with unga bunga Sol is the right one, got it
[3:50:25] <nailwind> nice punish
[3:50:26] <%Afterman_> @AhmCha worres how
[3:50:33] <+Grayhammatter> nice nice nice
[3:50:35] <rocket_da_madman> stay on his ass
[3:50:41] <shotgang86> Seems like a hard matchup with Nago
[3:50:44] <nailwind> no respite for this man
[3:50:45] <+Radkon> Damn what is this train parade in the bg
[3:50:47] <th3_gaming_dumb> his timestop van be burst or blocked
[3:50:51] <AhmCha> @Afterman_ I just think he's gonna be the hardest character for me to fight
[3:50:55] <KidKaiser23> No one has said it but that Sliding Sweep is kinda it‚Äôs own movement option
[3:50:57] <BoxNavy> this is a spooky matchup
[3:50:57] <Julbot1> Nago is set to be a boss character if you can git gud with him.
[3:50:58] <%RVMSpeedWagon> have we figured out nago's good matchups yet?
[3:50:59] <Solidnick18> axl...
[3:51:03] <oxbezoar> axl's always hard in every game
[3:51:05] <pepinillomaton> Negative penalty is too much lol
[3:51:11] <+AnthraxJohnson> Ky time?
[3:51:21] <TrashLeviathan> does FD'ing axl even do anything
[3:51:21] <+mechslayer71> @rvmspeedwagon yeah: Nago LUL LUL LUL
[3:51:30] <countgaculatv> Woolie I think your biggest problem is wasting tension on FDing too much. You keep FDing when those resources can be stored better.
[3:51:32] <%RVMSpeedWagon> @mechslayer71 LUL LUL LUL
[3:51:32] <%jaguarkek318> ur not command grabbing axl this early, everybody still mashing alot
[3:51:32] <%LastHazzerd> so is this another Baiken situation?
[3:51:34] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Oh yeah he does have command grabs lol
[3:51:39] <%JustToWatch> if you do quickmatch you'll probably run into Max
[3:51:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Be more aggressive. Go fo blood
[3:51:49] <+volkmardeadguy> should just embrace the meter and rip the super when you get rage
[3:51:56] <Crowroost> Woolie already putting a lotta effort in Nago when he gets so easily clowned by most of the roster BibleThump
[3:51:58] <+o_almighty_1> Bite command throw combos
[3:52:05] <codizle> Where's Reggie at?
[3:52:06] <Applecannon63> Be aggressive not safe
[3:52:14] <+Koopert_> oh so there is quick match?
[3:52:18] <MKII> thank god
[3:52:23] <%ekodrop> i think it's broken atm
[3:52:25] <th3_gaming_dumb> would be neat if comboable
[3:52:27] <TigerClaws12> max is matchmaking if you wanna meet him there
[3:52:30] <%ekodrop> max hasn't played a match
[3:52:31] <TrashLeviathan> you can quick match even in training mode
[3:52:31] <+volkmardeadguy> i looked at max and the first person he played was AWSofficial2
[3:52:43] <Dirksolomon> Have you tested out the netcode part? Like match up with people from across the woooorld
[3:52:43] <%ekodrop> he said it wasn't working
[3:52:56] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @ekodrop I don't think it's broken it's just that there's a small amount of people playing right now
[3:52:57] <sir_nack> stan-
[3:52:57] <+Hayajin_> makes it sound like someone has to find you in the lobby and challenge you
[3:53:00] <+Jiggisnipe> oh is it not working?
[3:53:17] <BoxNavy> red ram is cute
[3:53:27] <TopTierHarley> match making works but no one is doing it cause they are all in lobbies
[3:53:27] <Cosairen> all rams are cute
[3:53:28] <Hessman212> @codizle Woolie was feeling sickish so Reggies at home
[3:53:29] <sweetestbeefs> orange ram is just may lol
[3:53:33] <crazypsico55> Is this the full cast for the game?
[3:53:34] <+BottledLineArt> The gray with the orange for Ram is so sick looking.
[3:53:34] <el_sloth> light skin ram DansGame
[3:53:35] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> sucks that ram
[3:53:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Red and Green are better.
[3:53:39] <Crowroost> Woolie confirming that Grey ram = best Ram
[3:53:41] <%RVMSpeedWagon> @Cosairen i see u are a man of culture
[3:53:44] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> *sucks that ram's skin changes between colors
[3:53:46] <TopTierHarley> @crazypsico55 no Anji or last character
[3:53:47] <+superrhubarbpie> @crazypsico55 Missing 2 characters
[3:53:47] <Timothyer> Grey ram gives me Pinochet vibes
[3:53:53] <+MK_Ineptitude> @WoolieVersus if you want some footage of Nago as reference, check out LI Joe's stream.
[3:53:55] <crazypsico55> thx
[3:53:58] <+Hayajin_> oh he's in japan 7
[3:53:58] <Applecannon63> Ramethal with the Kamen rider Buster palette
[3:54:01] <%JustToWatch> did you have to choose a lobby for quickmatch?
[3:54:08] <fdc434> thank you for being you woolie <3
[3:54:08] <+OrangeMDT> This way Woolie can do training while saying he‚Äôs trying to do online
[3:54:09] <Picia000123> Every char in the game has cool skins, they all are neato
[3:54:09] <%ekodrop> max just quit quickmatch
[3:54:09] <+The_Protagonist> @Paranoid_Jumbotron everyone's skin changes between colors
[3:54:10] <kinggum41> white ram is cursed
[3:54:18] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> @The_Protagonist not nago
[3:54:18] <+Jiggisnipe> Max is in lobbies now
[3:54:20] <%ekodrop> is in lobby now
[3:54:20] <floralkami> @paranoid_jumbotron okay, I'm glad I'm not the only one who has problems with that.
[3:54:21] <%JustToWatch> Max just left quickmatch
[3:54:23] <TopTierHarley> It works @woolieversus it just no one is using it lol
[3:54:28] <BoxNavy> everyone is in lobbies for some reason
[3:54:32] <%ekodrop> 7f
[3:54:32] <+Parrish_broadnax> Max literally just went to lobby lol
[3:54:33] <ReadinRambo> Max is in lobby
[3:54:36] <ullyzeez> nah u gotta wait
[3:54:38] <Applecannon63> max left
[3:54:40] <sweetestbeefs> just use the lab for now
[3:54:40] <inkthepeasant> max is in lobby lmfao
[3:54:40] <Cosairen> lmao
[3:54:42] <Picia000123> time to get back to lobbies LUL
[3:54:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:54:45] <blackjackskellington> Max is lobby now
[3:54:46] <TopTierHarley> @boxnavy cause they can play their friends that way
[3:54:46] <MKII> if quick match is a different player pool than lobby isn't that kinda useless
[3:54:48] <sweetestbeefs> train ur blood samurai
[3:54:49] <+b_aleph> god, just parsec with max! THE PEOPLE WANT IT
[3:54:53] <RudeRabbit> ArcSys like "You're going to use our awful lobby system and you're gonna LIKE it"
[3:54:58] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> My guess is that everyone being in a lobby is why quickmatch doesn't work. No ones using it lol
[3:55:02] <Gadlight> woolieFABRICATION
[3:55:07] <rocket_da_madman> that probably explains why max isnt getting matches
[3:55:16] <+Hayajin_> he`s in japan 10 now
[3:55:16] <inkthepeasant> Max is in 10f
[3:55:17] <+Parrish_broadnax> Max was using it, he just went to lobbies
[3:55:19] <BlackermanZX> well theres only a few people so
[3:55:22] <HamFamJam> are you playing with arcade stick or ps controller?

[3:55:26] <vingadivo> max is using it and he gets matches once in a whiel
[3:55:30] <%JustToWatch> Max went to Japan 10f
[3:55:30] <Picia000123> So the thing is, it didn't work before, so now people are just not risking it, I think
[3:55:30] <The_Ombudsman> tokyo 10 takes no prisoners
[3:55:39] <Triplicat> it would work if it was working-- it explicitly tells you that it places your body in the lobby while you're in training mode
[3:55:43] <floralkami> @mkii lobby is generally for people to find specific people and match with that person consistently. quick match is for random battles without much thought.
[3:55:45] <Triplicat> that's what the dumbbell icon is for
[3:55:46] <nailwind> zeus meditating all by themselves
[3:55:48] <+Hayajin_> there is a button to see the people in there
[3:55:52] <+Radkon> Japan 10 is where it's going down
[3:55:53] <Aramonde_San> Hey Woolie & chat KonCha

[3:56:15] <+Hayajin_> yes
[3:56:23] <%JustToWatch> standby in training mode?
[3:56:30] <TopTierHarley> oh it's the Korean Birdie player
[3:56:31] <HamFamJam> are you playing with arcade stick or playstation controller?
[3:56:31] <overfiend_> oh its xyzzy
[3:56:32] <floralkami> @double_zr_tap the only problems he's had so far was when Minh's editing was eating up bandwidth.
[3:56:42] <+Hayajin_> well if they also do this they won't find you
[3:56:42] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[3:56:43] <double_zr_tap> cool
[3:56:44] <Timothyer> I wish that projectile Nag has had the option to function as a tp
[3:56:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> compared to the last beta there's a ton of matches happening now
[3:56:47] <nailwind> Zeus is secretly the strongest player awaiting the adventurous
[3:56:49] <Picia000123> Just like Fax in Japan :)
[3:56:54] <vertoxz> nago cosplay stream when?
[3:56:56] <TurtlesAndTentacles> but you also get to train inbetween not playing
[3:57:15] <sweetestbeefs> oh man, is chat gonna blow up about brown axel
[3:57:15] <+Hayajin_> oof
[3:57:17] <RudeRabbit> @nailwind "Finally, someone brave enough to appr- wait, where are you going???"
[3:57:17] <DedlokPM> @HamFamJam ps5 controller because he is more used to playing Guilty Gear on Pad

[3:58:44] <WakeUpThrow> Can you block the time stop or is it a free conversion?
[3:58:44] <randominternetsurfer> did Woolie win any matches yet?
[3:58:45] <+mechslayer71> Why does woolie enjoy pain?
[3:58:48] <TopTierHarley> yes @joe2187

[3:58:58] <Darren716> Has Woolie fought a single Potemkin yet?
[3:59:04] <countgaculatv> YES MILLIA BAYBEE
[3:59:05] <sir_nack> ayy millia
[3:59:05] <TopTierHarley> not Wrestling man lol
[3:59:13] <Cosairen> @Darren716 potemkin is a myth
[3:59:14] <+Jiggisnipe> I don't think we have seen Potemkin or Faust
[3:59:15] <%saladin1911> Ayyyy, Millia!
[3:59:16] <+Joe2187> does the launcher require full charge?
[3:59:17] <nailwind> no Faust either
[3:59:20] <el_sloth> yes he was
[3:59:20] <%gatorafan> @Darren716 What's a Potemkin? Kappa
[3:59:22] <floralkami> @wakeupthrow apparently yes cause he blocked it against Obama earlier.
[3:59:23] <+b_aleph> @Darren716 no one's playing potemkin, chipp and faust
[3:59:28] <+b_aleph> and Leo
[3:59:29] <TopTierHarley> yes unless it's counter hit @joe2187
[3:59:29] <%RVMSpeedWagon> i imagine pot vs nago is bad for nago
[3:59:32] <Deadpool2450> no JW was using Potemkin for a bit
[3:59:34] <Merlander_> Hitting quickly doesn't really seem Nago's Style
[3:59:35] <%Mrbaconator> just wait till octopimp is on
[3:59:37] <The_Ombudsman> oh no milia
[3:59:39] <Crowroost> You think Potemkin's rare, ive been watching multiple streams for a while and not seen a single Chipp
[3:59:41] <Afrosamasenpai> Better find James again
[3:59:43] <sir_nack> god damn millia lmao
[3:59:44] <%ChoculaUltra> lack of Chipp is pain
[3:59:46] <WakeUpThrow> @floralkami Ahh, I see. Ty
[3:59:46] <+Joe2187> Thanks for the info
[3:59:48] <Darren716> I think this is the first Millia I've seen
[3:59:48] <Saltmeisterr> octo didn't get a key so rip
[3:59:49] <Pnueddoq> JChensor is using potemkin
[3:59:50] <%JustToWatch> that's weird, Woolie and Max are both in Japan 10F, but there are different numbers of people. Are there multiple instances?
[3:59:51] <+b_aleph> @RVMSpeedWagon every matchup is bad for nago right now
[3:59:53] <TopTierHarley> no problem
[3:59:54] <The_Ombudsman> that damage holy shit
[3:59:55] <nailwind> Chipp might be actually nonexistent, hes a myth
[3:59:59] <mihokspawn> @Merlander_ its about stopping Hammerfall
[4:00:06] <Picia000123> Honestly, I am surprised I've seen a bunch of Axl's already, he never was this popular
[4:00:06] <+VladVandal> oofers
[4:00:08] <Vaunno> W
[4:00:12] <double_zr_tap> Yeah, Go Woolie go!
[4:00:20] <RudeRabbit> MAN, that Slash screen was sick
[4:00:24] <Cosairen> why would you play a character made out of toilet paper in a game with 90% combos on normal health characters
[4:00:25] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[4:00:26] <+Jiggisnipe> Millias all about mixups
[4:00:33] <Merlander_> @mihokspawn Does Nago have a two hitting normal
[4:00:34] <R0kushi> lets go woolie!
[4:00:36] <mihokspawn> @Picia000123 he never lived up to the fantasy of a Time Lord before :)
[4:00:37] <%drefizz> faust theme!
[4:00:40] <countgaculatv> Fast as fuck boi
[4:00:42] <Timothyer> @Picia000123 Axl might not be super popular but Dio is always in.
[4:00:44] <floralkami> @picia000123 he not only got a great redesign, but his toolset is a bit more interesting than it used to be
[4:00:49] <nailwind> Chipp in this game is no hit speedrun
[4:00:54] <MutedMimic> Zoomin
[4:00:58] <%saladin1911> @picia000123 probably because everyone thinks he's top tier and you know how people are
[4:01:00] <MichaelOfCainhurst> @Picia000123 they probably wanted to try the time stop

[4:01:27] <mihokspawn> @Merlander_ not sure, but he might have enough range to hit twice
[4:01:28] <HamFamJam> how does the ps5 d-pad compare to ps4 when it comes to fighting games?
[4:01:28] <%RVMSpeedWagon> okay millia calm down

[4:02:50] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 8 minutes
[4:02:51] <Darren716> Til the 21st i think
[4:03:05] <Aussie_Manny> Oh damn, our man's already been going 4 hours. I'm late lol
[4:03:06] <+discognition> Do we feel like with Nago in cast Baiken is got no chance?
[4:03:18] <+cascadepersona> Oh, this guy is a godlike SF player.
[4:03:20] <+kenyr> so is Blood mode something you are trying to avoid, or get into?
[4:03:30] <KidKaiser23> I like that Nago‚Äôs Projectile tells other Projectiles ‚ÄúNo‚Äù
[4:03:34] <Cosairen> avoid
[4:03:34] <mr_mister0> f
[4:03:36] <+discognition> And Gio takes Jam's spot, right?
[4:03:37] <Crowroost> @kenyr yes.
[4:03:41] <Aussie_Manny> Am I surprised Woolie is Nago? No.
[4:03:42] <Solidnick18> jesus axl
[4:03:47] <The_Ombudsman> how is axl? is the timestop busted?
[4:03:49] <XfourtwoX> uh, like always out of nowhere, today there a Nintendo Direct... new Smahs Chara?
[4:03:49] <+RealThiele> deep breaths
[4:03:49] <BoxNavy> blood seems like more of an inconvenience than anything
[4:03:50] <NotHereToStream> you're learning, you'll get there
[4:03:50] <Cosairen> its got a really punishing start up
[4:03:52] <Darlos9D> avoid... but only if you're clear across the screen
[4:03:54] <stabbityrabbit> @kenyr Generally avoid, but it seems like it might have situational uses.
[4:04:06] <TheChapyGuy> Axl is such an oppressive man
[4:04:06] <+Radkon> Is nago's projectile a low?
[4:04:08] <%saladin1911> @discognition Nah, they're nothing alike and Baiken is popular enough to warrant a DLC spot at least
[4:04:10] <Darlos9D> seems pretty advantageous up close
[4:04:19] <+Radkon> Holy fuck
[4:04:20] <abitfickle> lol

[4:05:21] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Just got back, how many matches has Woolie won?
[4:05:21] <Applecannon63> Ign Korea is a beast
[4:05:27] <+b_aleph> Are you going to lose to IGN, Woolie? ARE YOU?
[4:05:30] <HauserIII> Yo, so what's the verdict, is GG Strive better than SFV so far?
[4:05:37] <Cosairen> @b_aleph he already did once
[4:05:41] <+mechslayer71> @lerouch_the_rebel 1 all day, I think
[4:05:41] <+thegamekirby98> Finally have internet to watch, how's the game and Nago?
[4:05:44] <nailwind> ign Korea reached god floor, they've been on the streets
[4:05:45] <+Parrish_broadnax> IGN Korea Dont Mess around
[4:05:47] <vingadivo> woolie you can't lose to ign
[4:05:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> IGN KOREA?!
[4:05:52] <Saltmeisterr> @HauserIII yes
[4:05:53] <DianaTheAscian> oh its ign Korea again
[4:05:55] <Aussie_Manny> So in this game, the most common number of hits in a combo is about 3-5, I think? I always see "5 HITS" or something flash in the background.
[4:05:56] <AfternoonConcession> who does nago play like?
[4:06:00] <KidKaiser23> Woolie gettin better knockin mfs out the sky
[4:06:00] <+Radkon> IGN Korea's putting in work, respect
[4:06:02] <floralkami> @hauseriii oh, leagues better

[4:06:17] <AfternoonConcession> tight
[4:06:19] <+Parrish_broadnax> I love her theme so much
[4:06:19] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Losing to Korea is acceptable, but IGN? for shame
[4:06:22] <nailwind> super gorilla woman
[4:06:22] <Aussie_Manny> 4/10
[4:06:23] <Idon__> oh my GOD
[4:06:24] <winner_92> why giovanna got a mad hunch
[4:06:24] <DedlokPM> @aishman pretty good except for when Minh was trying to do some remote editing and uploading which messed with the connection
[4:06:25] <%saladin1911> Oh wow yeah, Woolie really does use FD everytime
[4:06:41] <+b_aleph> Goddamn these journalists!!!
[4:06:43] <Idon__> IGN Korea got some skills
[4:06:46] <+Joe2187> G is a pressure monsters
[4:06:47] <InTheNameOfHarman> How you liking it so far?
[4:06:50] <+Cubancommando> how hard is it to get into the game if someone is not great with fighters?
[4:06:51] <+Radkon> That noise in Gio's outro is so weird
[4:06:52] <Giztech> what about using the blood rage activation apart of the juggle combo and then doing the super swing to get you out of it at the same time
[4:06:53] <floralkami> @woolieversus you're using FD Way too often
[4:06:54] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @fdc434
[4:06:56] <RamenRiderZ> Gio's theme gives me Lenny Kravitz vibes
[4:07:00] <Aussie_Manny> 4/10. Too much water on Nago. Kappa
[4:07:02] <+Joe2187> You should definitely give Giovanna a try @WoolieVersus
[4:07:03] <R0kushi> they not gonna be calling gg the souls like fighting game
[4:07:06] <@Menitta> Aw moobot
[4:07:07] <TopTierHarley> this GG is made for new players
[4:07:09] <KidKaiser23> Woolie loves his FDs y‚Äôall
[4:07:10] <tragicjohnson84> Giovanna is so cute
[4:07:10] <+cascadepersona> Game has a lower skill floor than previous Guilty Gear games.
[4:07:12] <BoxNavy> :(
[4:07:12] <rocket_da_madman> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:07:13] <+Chronor655> This feels rough

[4:07:17] <%jaguarkek318> like street fighter with gund
[4:07:20] <Monkeyweed21> Would Gio be more interesting if her dog nutted on her blanket?
[4:07:25] <Applecannon63> Is FD a guilty pleasure?
[4:07:32] <+Joe2187> Understood
[4:07:34] <The_Ombudsman> these lobbies fucking suck lol
[4:07:34] <countgaculatv> FD is an addiction

[4:08:13] <Aussie_Manny> Are the systems in Strive fair? I hope there's nothing cheap, like Vanish in DBFZ.
[4:08:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> Deep Leff? PogChamp
[4:08:17] <AfternoonConcession> @Cubancommando it's about finding people in your skill level and first figuring out what your character does, way later you try to figure out what your opponent can do
[4:08:18] <+nekodelic> EVIDENCE
[4:08:20] <+Joe2187> @pepinillomaton He's not for beginners, he's very high risk, very high reward
[4:08:20] <%deathscythe1287> deathscythe1287 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months!
[4:08:21] <Crowroost> Did Leffen have to shower before being allowed into the beta??
[4:08:24] <+Gamingand808s> milia pawg
[4:08:24] <Triplicat> this millia color is the best
[4:08:30] <bohemianmaadcity> Vanish isn‚Äôt cheap smh
[4:08:38] <TigerClaws12> cali burst
[4:08:39] <Monkeyweed21> oh sick Millia still has the moon
[4:08:41] <pepinillomaton> Aaaaaand the tension is gone
[4:08:45] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> woolie learning the hard way it seems
[4:08:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[4:08:53] <Applecannon63> so bascially stop treating Nago like Baiken?
[4:08:53] <Div_the_Penguin> well that's Milia LUL
[4:08:55] <+ItsSleepyBoi> shower jokes, nice n original KEKW
[4:08:58] <Darren716> If Leffen wins does it prove Smash is a fighting game?
[4:09:00] <+cascadepersona> 5K maybe?
[4:09:00] <$Giothegame> Leffen playing like he had the game for weeks
[4:09:06] <%jaguarkek318> burst no selling dusts is hilarious
[4:09:08] <+Xephonos> 1 brain cell still wins I see
[4:09:10] <+Asuo_> Her cross up seems insane
[4:09:12] <auctober_> No mercy for Leff
[4:09:19] <nailwind> its all about confidence and leff has too much of it
[4:09:21] <+Joe2187> what does purple burst do again?
[4:09:22] <%saladin1911> Millia says, "Let me see the back of your head real quick."
[4:09:24] <countgaculatv> Bruh Majin Obama tweeted about Woolie lmao
[4:09:26] <%jaguarkek318> unga millia is a problem
[4:09:30] <huskarl_zap> NO OKYZEMAYY? NOTPOG
[4:09:31] <thiccshoulders> give her a hair cut
[4:09:39] <bahablastfreeze> is backdash invincible?
[4:09:39] <floralkami> @asuo_ she still needs her pin, tho Kappa
[4:09:40] <RamenRiderZ> Might go Potemkin this time, always played as Ky and could use some change
[4:09:40] <+b_aleph> too much pressure, man
[4:09:43] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Nago seems like a "wait for a top player to figure out how to play them & then copy their playstyle" type of character

[4:10:06] <%paladinstarbuster> back to the lab again
[4:10:07] <Crowroost> Weird to see Leffen play an actual fighting game, he has a knack for it...
[4:10:13] <Saltmeisterr> lol i wonder how angry Leffen is
[4:10:18] <xUrbanCarnage> Still can‚Äôt believe people call Jam gorilla when this characters game plan is throw projectile do mix
[4:10:18] <+Xephonos> anyone know if dizzy will be in the roster?
[4:10:21] <countgaculatv> @beepbeepbopbop Netcode is great from what I hear
[4:10:24] <kinggum41> his buttons have to be really good to justify this blood thing surely
[4:10:26] <+cascadepersona> Leffen's played DBFZ before.
[4:10:28] <+kumaprime> Didnt Leffen play dbfz for a while?
[4:10:28] <TheGodLikeDownTwo> having fun with nago or is he mad annoying
[4:10:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie bonks himself back into the lab
[4:10:30] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos No clue.
[4:10:31] <townzzzzz> yo that red
[4:10:32] <GenericSoda> I've heard nothing but good stuff about the netcode
[4:10:33] <Aussie_Manny> Nooooo, pick something green or purple! D:
[4:10:33] <+cstigerwright> The Red, Black, Blue Nago colors are so clean
[4:10:35] <winner_92> yeah leffen has played other fighters for a while
[4:10:35] <Darren716> Yupp
[4:10:50] <+Radkon> Yep, you couldn't tell from the "HumbleGenius" tag?
[4:10:52] <+ItsSleepyBoi> Leffen was the best EU DBFZ player in 2018, so yeah he has FGC experience
[4:10:52] <GenericSoda> man Nago's theme is a jam
[4:10:52] <ainda_> Candy red two horns
[4:10:53] <+Xephonos> @cascadepersona *sad necro noises*
[4:11:03] <Aussie_Manny> Chat, I can't wait to see Sol Badguy be revealed for Smash tomorrow. Kappa
[4:11:05] <MutedMimic> SourPls
[4:11:15] <GenericSoda> SourPls
[4:11:17] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Is this Beta super closed or something?
[4:11:22] <+dee_zoe> bedman for smash or bust
[4:11:23] <Darlos9D> final, Sol vs Terry
[4:11:23] <Daigrey> This song sounds like it takes from "come together" by The Beatles.
[4:11:24] <+Krando> i find it ironic @Radkon He's anything but humble from what i've seen
[4:11:25] <+ItsSleepyBoi> im super upset that Faust was gutted
[4:11:28] <Zayasu> @ItsSleepyBoi he also played UMVC3 i think
[4:11:32] <+Asuo_> Can we talk about how most of this song is just uptemp of Come Together by the Beatles?
[4:11:33] <raveous> you can assume that 99% of players in the beta right now have fighting game experience
[4:11:33] <%saladin1911> Every colour on Nago is fucking sick
[4:11:34] <GenericSoda> @LeRouch_the_Rebel it opens on Thursday I think
[4:11:36] <prime_name> Public Beta opens up on the 18th, I think
[4:11:42] <%drefizz> @ItsSleepyBoi EU? jaboodyBruh
[4:11:42] <Div_the_Penguin> SourPls
[4:11:47] <Cosairen> cant wait for the leffen tweet saying he is the best person to ever grace the fgc again
[4:11:49] <Hammatime8> I don't think I'd be able to focus on training when a BANGER like this is playing
[4:11:53] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos I'm a degenerate who wants Sin, so I'm in a similar boat of just wanting Ky's entire family in, lol
[4:11:56] <Leebrownie> does anyone know if chipp got any new moves from the last beta
[4:11:59] <+nekodelic> Leffen vs GO1 in CEO 2018 DBFZ is one of the best sets in the FGC history
[4:12:07] <%ChoculaUltra> hoping this is the game that gets Guilty Gear some figmas and merch and shit.
[4:12:11] <+dee_zoe> oh fuck who is the lady and is there fan art
[4:12:14] <Aussie_Manny> !controls
[4:12:16] <+cascadepersona> Majin Obama's tweets have been hilarious on this game.
[4:12:17] <+kumaprime> That's a cool Nago color
[4:12:21] <Aussie_Manny> I'm assuming Woolie's on stick.
[4:12:28] <%ChoculaUltra> he's actually on pad
[4:12:31] <sir_nack> nah, woolie plays guilty gear on pad
[4:12:33] <Aussie_Manny> Oh for real?
[4:12:33] <+ItsSleepyBoi> @drefizz yeah, he's beaten players like Shanks n Wawa.
[4:12:35] <+mechslayer71> Pad @aussie_manny
[4:12:41] <AfternoonConcession> hifight found some cool stuff with nago @WoolieVersus
[4:12:44] <ThrillingTremors> woolie plays guilty gear on his leapfrog
[4:12:45] <GenericSoda> Does Nago have good options to meet Ram in the air or will she just outrange you?
[4:12:46] <+kumaprime> The beta lasts until the 22nd, right?
[4:12:49] <Aussie_Manny> Good! I love fighters that are accessible on pad too!
[4:12:58] <huskarl_zap> Masks off: YOU HAVE BROKEN THE MASQUERADE
[4:13:01] <+mechslayer71> Dark red and black is always a good combo. Same for dark blue and black
[4:13:09] <+EcchiRider> HIT HER WITH THE TIMBS!
[4:13:23] <Finakala> Watching Woolie trying to work out how to deal with Ramlethal makes me hope I never fight him
[4:13:23] <+Xephonos> @cascadepersona always want to learn sin. how is he?
[4:13:38] <+Radkon> SourPls holy shit
[4:13:43] <Aussie_Manny> those aren't timbs, they're giant sneakers lel
[4:13:44] <floralkami> @mechslayer71 * "colour"+ black has always been a good combo
[4:13:52] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> who's this new samurai?
[4:14:14] <floralkami> @aussie_manny jermaMoon
[4:14:18] <+BirdoFan> @WoolieVersus Do you feel like Nago is comparable to Slayer at all? other than visuals/ aesthetics
[4:14:20] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos He does stupid damage and can be ignorant from anything between midscreen and in your opponent's face, lol
[4:14:23] <BoxNavy> jermaMoon
[4:14:33] <+TopTieramisu> C O U N T E R
[4:14:38] <Applecannon63> Nagoriyuki a Vampire cyborg samurai that could be involved with Slayer
[4:14:43] <+VCRUZZO> probably can get a mix-up
[4:14:48] <floralkami> @michaelpleasefortheloveof new character, vampire samurai, possibly the first antagonist of this game
[4:14:50] <Aussie_Manny> Nago is fresh?
[4:14:54] <+Krando> just his command grab
[4:14:56] <R0kushi> they are vampires, thats it
[4:14:57] <%saladin1911> I think Sin is sick, just can't be arsed with his food gauge.
[4:15:00] <+Jiggisnipe> other than being a vampire
[4:15:01] <huskarl_zap> dudes kinda skinny down low needs more leg day
[4:15:03] <+Krando> the command grab is the same
[4:15:08] <thiccshoulders> twist her monster can
[4:15:09] <Applecannon63> Nago an Antagonist?
[4:15:14] <+TopTieramisu> is nagoriyuki a cyborg though? not just wearing a high tech mask?
[4:15:15] <floralkami> they both got vampire drip, but that's it
[4:15:20] <+Xephonos> @cascadepersona sounds as unga bunga as a salty potemkin or axel
[4:15:27] <Aussie_Manny> Fresh new characters are better than characters similar to old ones.
[4:15:29] <floralkami> @applecannon63 cyborg?
[4:15:29] <%ekodrop> mobility
[4:15:34] <BoxNavy> dandy steps :)
[4:15:35] <@chesterr01> @WoolieVersus when you land 2HS, they fall to the ground. if they are close enough you can DELAY 214HS to juggle. then cancel into DP 1-hit, dash in to finish the juggle
[4:15:35] <beatie_g> MASSIVE man
[4:15:39] <+mechslayer71> @toptieramisu just the mask, he‚Äôs a vampy
[4:15:39] <TerrorRISK> Anything from ABA outside of having a blood mechanic?
[4:15:48] <+hahaneat> I feel like tr
[4:15:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:15:56] <+BirdoFan> Okay sick I saw the dash and I was worried Slayer's slot was up lol
[4:15:58] <beatie_g> how u liking the game tho?
[4:15:58] <Applecannon63> I mean the mask is supressing his vamp abilities
[4:15:59] <LorcaNomad> wait what's the downside to nago's blood bar?
[4:16:05] <pepinillomaton> He has damage and range, but i dont know if it compensates
[4:16:12] <Darren716> LorcaNomad It drains your health down to 1
[4:16:13] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos But what if you combined those too? Hence, Sin shutting you down with Beak Driver.
[4:16:14] <%DaRoosta89> drains your health
[4:16:15] <ainda_> His blood mechanic is very diff from ABA. she drains much slower and per hit, can recover lost health, and ones to be transformed all the time. with Nago its not as straightforwrad
[4:16:17] <NotHereToStream> uh can c.S act as an anti-air?
[4:16:17] <double_zr_tap> have you tried any of the other characters yet?
[4:16:18] <%paladinstarbuster> Health go down
[4:16:22] <floralkami> @lorcanomad health melts, and you lose access to most of your specials
[4:16:22] <+kumaprime> It drains health when full
[4:16:22] <shinra_kishi_> I hope that when dlc introduced, sin is one of the characters added
[4:16:24] <TrashLeviathan> @LorcaNomad his health drains and he loses specials
[4:16:26] <+hahaneat> I feel like the transition between nago's and son's meters are so good
[4:16:27] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> is abba in the game?
[4:16:28] <+Xephonos> @cascadepersona yikes
[4:16:29] <sir_nack> @LorcaNomad loses access to his specials and his life drains quickly
[4:16:30] <Applecannon63> Nago is the Sadira
[4:16:33] <RamenRiderZ> Nago needs an undying blood battery wife :)
[4:16:34] <ainda_> he can get health from the grab but its nt much
[4:16:48] <floralkami> @lorcanomad but chip and range goes WAY up.
[4:16:56] <PhantomMaskJr> No Blade color sstGrump
[4:17:06] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos I almost feel bad when I do it, lol.
[4:17:10] <Kusano123> i see james chen is kicking leffen's ass
[4:17:16] <+Rekinsinn> does his blood super seem like a 'free' way to exit rage mode? or is it very punishable?
[4:17:22] <+TopTieramisu> are the tracks stage based?
[4:17:27] <countgaculatv> Maybe RC the punish?
[4:17:56] <floralkami> @rekinsinn wouldn't call it free in the slightest, but it's easier than letting it run out naturally
[4:17:58] <Applecannon63> his blood super cancels out his blood rage
[4:18:03] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> first off. what does his name mean?
[4:18:07] <countgaculatv> AAAAYYY I CALLED IT
[4:18:09] <doriandraws> red nago outfit is sick
[4:18:12] <+Xephonos> @cascadepersona thinking of reinstalling rev 2 to prep for this
[4:18:13] <raveous> what's the downward slash? can it anti-air?
[4:18:22] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhhhh, there's your anti-air?
[4:18:35] <+TopTieramisu> kizzie punished the hell out of woolie's blocked super
[4:18:35] <Aussie_Manny> yeyeye, woolie's found something :O
[4:18:36] <+cascadepersona> @woolieversus You know about the dash macro button? Useful for doing movement during RC.
[4:18:38] <pepinillomaton> K is also a good anti-air i heard
[4:18:41] <+hahaneat> SICK
[4:18:43] <countgaculatv> That was beautiful Woolie
[4:18:45] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> how does the 1st hit of the up slash special juggle?
[4:18:48] <floralkami> @michaelpleasefortheloveof something about the fresh snow before spring, iurc
[4:18:52] <floralkami> *iirc
[4:18:57] <Aussie_Manny> well i'll be damned, he's on pad.
[4:18:58] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos I'll be doing the same, and also playing Melty Blood, lol
[4:19:00] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> odd.
[4:19:02] <+cascadepersona> Ah, I see.
[4:19:11] <+Asuo_> No fight stick?
[4:19:14] <LeafarOz> yeh
[4:19:22] <BlackermanZX> no its directional
[4:19:22] <floralkami> you can drift all RCs
[4:19:23] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> very strange so how does that go in to ... i mean he has slayer's grab but that's about it.
[4:19:27] <Applecannon63> Its control Pad
[4:19:28] <townzzzzz> gotta build that muscle memory
[4:19:30] <+Xephonos> @cascadepersona been on tekken ,unist, and prbg
[4:19:32] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> i only came in recently so.
[4:19:35] <PhantomMaskJr> castleheadDAB castleheadDAB castleheadDAB
[4:19:39] <MikeyxStyles> all RCS are driftable
[4:19:39] <Bayomycry> You drift depending on your input, you just need to do it back or forward
[4:19:45] <Jashter18> Woolie mentioned he played the other GGs on Pad so thats why he's doing it here
[4:19:48] <%SouLucha> Dash Macro?
[4:19:54] <MikeyxStyles> yes
[4:20:10] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos It's been a while since I played Tekken, I'll have to try the netcode update sometime.
[4:20:10] <Aussie_Manny> niiiiice
[4:20:11] <floralkami> all RCs can be drifted, in the 4 cardinal directions @woolieversus
[4:20:15] <BlackermanZX> you can even drift up iirc
[4:20:34] <Aussie_Manny> Flash step! Hayai...!
[4:20:41] <Toni_Master43> "When I do get all my blood all nutty" -Woolie 2021
[4:20:42] <raveous> like the only think you can't RC in this game
[4:20:45] <+cascadepersona> @soulucha L3 is a macro to do a dash command by default in Strive, which is extremely useful for doing airdash as fast as possible on a stick.
[4:20:46] <countgaculatv> Can you RC before popping blood?
[4:20:47] <%saladin1911> He knows about the RC drift dudes
[4:20:50] <+Xephonos> @cascadepersona how's melty blood?
[4:20:55] <PhantomMaskJr> Eww nutty blood sstWTF
[4:21:04] <Aussie_Manny> Combo off the burst? Naaah.
[4:21:08] <floralkami> @saladin1911 seems like he didn't, asking that question, lol
[4:21:11] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> so he's modled after a jpop guy.
[4:21:14] <Davimotion96> I saw on twitter that it's safe on block
[4:21:14] <huskarl_zap> spite nut blood
[4:21:15] <pepinillomaton> so if you know you are going to blood rage, you better do your dash to get into the enemies face
[4:21:19] <RudeRabbit> Can't RC?
[4:21:21] <+emogee_thehomie> 6k to command grab? @WoolieVersus
[4:21:26] <raveous> can you break the wall with the bloodrage trigger?
[4:21:27] <floralkami> @michaelpleasefortheloveof who?
[4:21:29] <countgaculatv> @WoolieVersus What about RCing before popping thirst?
[4:21:30] <+Rekinsinn> can you have the activation hit as a juggle?
[4:21:36] <Xelhesia> if you combo into the blood burst its safe i think
[4:21:45] <Triplicat> no the person who wallbreaks on install is ky dragon install
[4:21:51] <+AnthraxJohnson> Yo those colours are sick!
[4:21:58] <huskarl_zap> Spite nut blood? Thats a happy birthday
[4:22:01] <+cascadepersona> @xephonos Melty Blood is pretty fun, though it's a Discord Fighter, so you have to engage with others through that way. Every character has three styles, and the grand majority of the cast is pretty viable. I like it a lot.
[4:22:10] <Triplicat> I'm honestly a little surprised nagoriyuki's does not
[4:22:13] <PhantomMaskJr> Who‚Äôs theme is playing in the background?
[4:22:22] <floralkami> you should be able to RC before your pop to; that's what I saw in that first Nago vs Sol match on IGN NA
[4:22:24] <+cascadepersona> @phantommaskjr Nagoriyuki's
[4:22:28] <killaholic89> This is nagos theme
[4:22:29] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> now this is just rumor so take it with a grain of salt... or the whole shaker.. but ... @floralkami "Nagoriyuki is modeled after an African-American J-Pop musician named Chris Hart, and named after one of his songs from his 2016 album ‚ÄúHeart Song Tears‚Äù"
[4:22:30] <TerrorRISK> Going to have to combo into it like in the dev match of Nago Vs Sol. He used it to wall combo.
[4:22:48] <BlackermanZX> gotta end the dust though
[4:22:56] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> BRUH
[4:22:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:22:58] <Applecannon63> end the dust combo?
[4:23:06] <+Bamaut> Is Nago a link character like Slayer/Kum?
[4:23:10] <+mechslayer71> So blood rage pops involuntarily?
[4:23:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @michaelpleasefortheloveof I think that got disprooved
[4:23:24] <PhantomMaskJr> @cascadepersona @killaholic89 not the kinda theme I thought he would have larxaHmm
[4:23:34] <sir_nack> main buff is range i guess
[4:23:36] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo you can see his fangs on the camera zoom in
[4:23:37] <Cosairen> oh his fangs look so good with the mask off
[4:23:39] <killaholic89> @mechslayer71 it‚Äôs supposed to be a punishment for using too many specials
[4:23:40] <floralkami> @michaelpleasefortheloveof wow, that's a deep cut if true. frankly, I'm surprised to the most by "African-American Jpop star"
[4:23:41] <BlackermanZX> getting a combo with the blood super would be ideal
[4:23:49] <+cascadepersona> Blood rage pops involuntarily if you don't manage the amount of special move cancels you use, but if you do it close to the opponent, it is safe.
[4:23:53] <Aussie_Manny> Is defense difficult in this game like it is in DBFZ?
[4:23:55] <huskarl_zap> That ms paint grey box lul
[4:23:59] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> that or they can't say it because if they did confirm it ... well that might be a lolsuit... but... hmm.
[4:24:00] <floralkami> *surprised the most
[4:24:04] <+mechslayer71> @killaholic89 but it also gives huge chip right? Interesting
[4:24:05] <doriandraws> when is blood rage worth it? seems like the normals are the only significant buff. so far.
[4:24:06] <0rnan> Big ol samurai
[4:24:07] <ullyzeez> maybe the character sucks?
[4:24:22] <BlackermanZX> the blood rage super hits like a goddamn truck
[4:24:26] <+b1eed_> hes to cool to suck
[4:24:27] <+mechslayer71> @ullyzeez that‚Äôs not gonna stop woolie
[4:24:28] <Applecannon63> the character doesn't suck but hard to master
[4:24:34] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @floralkami then again someone else said that was disproven in the chat.
[4:24:36] <ainda_> that nago you played against did bakwards jump light out of rage at the corner, i think that looked okay?
[4:24:37] <TerrorRISK> @Aussie_Manny That's usually the case for all the games made by this company imo.
[4:24:48] <shonuffkotti_the_shogun> does the blood guage reduce when doing on that dust combo
[4:24:49] <Aussie_Manny> @TerrorRISK dang it
[4:24:49] <killaholic89> @mechslayer71 huge and a unique super but he loses, all his other special moves
[4:25:05] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @TerrorRISK wait it doesn't have that stalwart defense like accent core had?
[4:25:10] <+mechslayer71> @killaholic89 but does he get the chip?
[4:25:16] <floralkami> @doriandraws well yes cause normals are all you can do in that state. if managed correctly, you could essentially kill a person in two hits in the second interaction.
[4:25:24] <BlackermanZX> his chip is insane

[4:25:32] <Applecannon63> Nagoriyuki is designed to be not easy what do you expect something Free?
[4:25:35] <killaholic89> Yeah he gets huge chip on his S and HS @mechslayer71
[4:25:46] <Aussie_Manny> The mix potential in DBFZ was fucking insane to defend. I'm hoping in Strive, it'll be more manageable.
[4:25:47] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> OH THAT'S DISGUSTING DAMAG
[4:25:49] <TerrorRISK> @Aussie_Manny You have more defensive options than DBFz if that means anything. Burst, Fautless Defense, Instant Block, etc.
[4:25:51] <Daigrey> Nago seems to have anti-air problems. anything for that?
[4:25:54] <ainda_> cuz like, it seems like you wanna create space after rage if youre not comboing off it somehow. so just immeadite backwards jump or backdash seems good
[4:25:56] <BlackermanZX> doing that suoer is enough LUL
[4:25:58] <+mechslayer71> @killaholic89 okay that‚Äôs what I thought, thanks
[4:25:59] <Sulliman34> yeah seems like they wanted an easy newcomer and a hard newcomer
[4:26:00] <shinra_kishi_> Oooohhh big boy damage
[4:26:01] <%DaRoosta89> @WoolieVersus is that forward step hit a low?
[4:26:15] <ullyzeez> woolie maybe save meter just for supers?? you arent really doing big combo damage my man
[4:26:17] <sir_nack> dbfz is annoying because of lack of defense options. guilty gear has a ton of defensive options
[4:26:19] <Picia000123> @Daigrey He has options, but they seem to be as commital as Axl's
[4:26:37] <MyooMyoo> @Aussie_Manny what do you mean?
[4:26:42] <stabbityrabbit> I think most of Nago's issues come from the teleport. It costs more than every other special it seems.
[4:26:46] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda wish everyone in DBFZ had the defensive options of UI Goku FeelsBadMan
[4:26:48] <Daigrey> @Picia000123 oof
[4:26:50] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> oh nago has a cute little suit
[4:26:51] <floralkami> @daigrey really? he sees to have excellent anti-airs, from 5K, 2H, and DP S

[4:30:10] <ullyzeez> @aussie_manny rollback frames is different from delay frames
[4:30:10] <SquiglyBattleOpera> Nago's sword normals do chip? Holy shit
[4:30:20] <+cascadepersona> @aussie_manny 107 ping and 3 Rollback frames, not input delay frames. The rollback frames automatically adjust depending on your connection.
[4:30:20] <Radioactivetaco9> @Aussie_Manny no the 3 frames is the max amount of frames itll rollback
[4:30:20] <Thunderhog> @Aussie_Manny You're right on ping, but the frames are rollback frames. COMPLETELY different from delay frames

[4:30:45] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> AC + R has rollback. god bless

[4:31:16] <floralkami> @ramble_time I suggest watching Hi-Fight's recent stream upload; the first 20-30 min are Nago labbing.

[4:36:35] <%ChoculaUltra> you can find Strive on Steam but the Beta is only for PS4/PS5 right meow
[4:36:36] <+b_aleph> @Sir_Dolphinian about 15k viewers on twitch

[4:38:23] <Palmtuna> Woolie is beginning to believe PogChamp
[4:38:29] <%saladin1911> @boxnavy Nobody can, let's be real
[4:38:30] <nailwind> more and more people started labbing after seeing that quickmatch works
[4:38:35] <Aussie_Manny> That's NO GOOD!
[4:38:38] <Slippedbeast> Is this a beta or the full game?
[4:38:43] <Applecannon63> beta
[4:38:43] <pepinillomaton> mashing is death but at the same time, not being on the offensive is also death
[4:38:44] <Timothyer> beta
[4:38:45] <+Parrish_broadnax> this is beta
[4:38:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Nago reminds me a lot of Hakumen minus the insta counters. Meaty ass normals, huge range, etc.
[4:38:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If you exit the game when the beta is offline, you get locked out until the next beta period
[4:39:02] <MyooMyoo> Counter is so sick in this game, the way the fall slowly from it makes me wonder if you can like super jump in to combo like crazy with Gio
[4:39:05] <rcand9> woolie is there a superman outfit for when standing behind a group in a fight?
[4:39:23] <floralkami> @rcand9 LUL
[4:39:26] <ullyzeez> samsho
[4:39:27] <ThrillingTremors> Nago legit a Sam Sho character
[4:39:29] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @WoolieVersus didn't they nerf Chipp's mobility?
[4:39:30] <%phd_in_thuggery> He's like a SamSho character in Guilty Gear.
[4:39:34] <pepinillomaton> they finished now i think
[4:39:38] <%ChoculaUltra> He's very schmeaty.
[4:39:40] <Applecannon63> Honest SamSho
[4:39:40] <+Anonymasque> rollback is still going strong?
[4:39:44] <MyooMyoo> Yay go steve
[4:39:49] <Xelhesia> YEYEEYEEEEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:39:49] <puluxor> My two favorite FGC personas on the same screen! VoHiYo VoHiYo

[4:39:57] <BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[4:40:00] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> If Jack-o comes in they're gonna nerf her ass Kappa
[4:40:00] <PainterOfMiniatures> They're doing one more
[4:40:03] <+Parrish_broadnax> He says he'll do 1 more with steve
[4:40:03] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ
[4:40:03] <TheChapyGuy> he's saying one more with Steve
[4:40:04] <+thackattack00> Max is going one more with Steve
[4:40:05] <+RyGuy182> he said "last one with steve"
[4:40:06] <velgaduere> he says last one with Steve
[4:40:07] <%phd_in_thuggery> ah, shame

[4:40:09] <Aussie_Manny> Ahhh, they're still fighting
[4:40:09] <+b_aleph> he said they'll do a last one
[4:40:10] <+NYCrownlessKing> max said last one last one one more, then ur next @WoolieVersus

[4:40:21] <Deadpool2450> look for JW
[4:40:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie just watching in the closet with the superman costume on
[4:40:22] <MyooMyoo> their just bashing their heads against each other learning their characters XD
[4:40:25] <+Parrish_broadnax> Great loving the game
[4:40:25] <PainterOfMiniatures> Can't wait for this one
[4:40:25] <BaslerJones> sad
[4:40:25] <+BenevolentBeetle> <3
[4:40:27] <extradopeness> He‚Äôs doing ONE MORE lmao
[4:40:27] <+TrapLordHuey> no spectator mode?
[4:40:28] <double_zr_tap> good
[4:40:29] <BoxNavy> :)
[4:40:29] <MOON__MIST> the game genuinely hype
[4:40:31] <+Parrish_broadnax> Nago looks fun
[4:40:32] <%phd_in_thuggery> @woolieversus what's your favorite song so far?
[4:40:32] <Reisadan> Doing as well as can be expected at the present moment in time.
[4:40:32] <+NoMoreChie> what you think of the beta so far?
[4:40:34] <%ChoculaUltra> there's no number counter on salty runbacks, just sayin LUL
[4:40:36] <huskarl_zap> Why is Gedeon good?
[4:40:37] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Any character that is still in your missing spot? or the best redesign yet?
[4:40:37] <rcand9> did max see him on stream chat?
[4:40:39] <ullyzeez> they dont wanna play with a nago main
[4:40:39] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[4:40:42] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Sucks that the PC version's getting the short end of the stick; beta, colors, editions, etc.
[4:40:43] <+Parrish_broadnax> You're doin awesome out there
[4:40:44] <%slimmixrp> Crying I cant play Strive
[4:40:44] <+Jiggisnipe> losing is learning
[4:40:44] <CrmznOgre> So should we not expect Nago in later installments if Akrsys decide to go back to form?
[4:40:45] <bootysteve> The animations in this game are fuckin CRISP
[4:40:47] <GeltonZ> Doin' okay but very worried about this game. Dunno who the heck I'm gonna play.
[4:40:47] <BlackermanZX> You are learning fast
[4:40:48] <lazyagus> Do you plan on trying another character other than Nago?
[4:40:54] <+discognition> Nago a slower character?
[4:40:55] <Merlander_> Does Nago feel weak to you, or just a hard character?
[4:40:55] <+Anonymasque> So what is the tradeoff for mobility? Range/dmg?
[4:40:57] <%SirGO0SE> yeah you're playing some bosses too
[4:40:58] <HeavyManaBeast2> spectate would be nice
[4:40:59] <%slayabee> Nago is seems like a workhorse character
[4:40:59] <concretenj> @WoolieVersus how hard are you gonna grind this game first month? if at all?
[4:41:01] <+b_aleph> I couldn't get into fighting games because of all the losing :(
[4:41:01] <Div_the_Penguin> matchmaking pls
[4:41:01] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Any predictions for the last slot? I'm hopelessly waiting for my boy Raven
[4:41:04] <$drabberfaun535> "out of the way"
[4:41:10] <puluxor> It's 2AM in Yurop and I'm watching fightan game streams. Lets go.
[4:41:10] <%phd_in_thuggery> Build up to the Castle
[4:41:11] <Meltgar> Nago might be like Hakumen? Slow but big damage?
[4:41:13] <PainterOfMiniatures> Dang, Max is rocking Tasty Steve over here.
[4:41:13] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus whats Nagos worst mach up if you were to guess?
[4:41:15] <ullyzeez> oh absolutely man chat is just busting your balls
[4:41:17] <Applecannon63> Lose is the most fun than winning
[4:41:18] <%ChoculaUltra> its gotta be Asuka/That Man
[4:41:19] <+Jiggisnipe> you nailed it Woolie Kappa
[4:41:19] <therealtacopancakes> you been doing better these last games
[4:41:19] <%1000_buffers> 1000_buffers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Kick some ass psaDab
[4:41:21] <%JustToWatch> also, it's a very easy change to make if arcsys wants to buff nago
[4:41:25] <lazyagus> Also is this the first japanese developed fighting game with good netcode?
[4:41:26] <DreTPK> You have a chance to try anyone else yet?
[4:41:27] <+pr_illuminati> I'm gonna practice combos while working from home and no one can stop me
[4:41:27] <nailwind> hakumen with no counter
[4:41:28] <%ekodrop> less counter heavy
[4:41:30] <%phd_in_thuggery> Comic books?
[4:41:32] <BlackermanZX> Well two Ls make a W if you squeeze hard enough doodDerp
[4:41:33] <mihokspawn> Aesthetically too
[4:41:35] <%slimmixrp> Max's gio is skrong
[4:41:37] <Misterjablez> Can Nago RC out of his Blood Rage animation though I wonder
[4:41:39] <ZeeJiggle> This'll be the first Guilty Gear I play, super excited~
[4:41:41] <pepinillomaton> So I guess Nago is all about finding your window and exploding
[4:41:43] <%ChoculaUltra> Hakumen's counter is so damn cool
[4:41:44] <raveous> yup, the cancelling specials thing is a big thing for hakumen
[4:41:45] <+Cactuskris> Does that make him the black void?
[4:41:50] <%Sweetangy021> And Hakumen can still airdash
[4:41:52] <thiccshoulders> seen much of zato?
[4:41:52] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:41:57] <TigerClaws12> parry would be scary af LUL
[4:41:58] <%paladinstarbuster> Giving Nago a counter that would be great
[4:42:06] <Timothyer> Parry would be Baiken no?
[4:42:07] <IncredibleMeh> he seems like Cliff but exciting
[4:42:08] <+Cactuskris> he¬¥s more like sussano
[4:42:09] <stevo_scar> damn still going
[4:42:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> His step is his armor
[4:42:15] <Applecannon63> Nago needs a parry system
[4:42:16] <extradopeness> Max has been making an example of Steve‚Äôs Leo it‚Äôs honestly incredible
[4:42:18] <nailwind> LUL I want Woolie to run into Haitani's Zato. It's impossible
[4:42:25] <rcand9> nago missing something you think?
[4:42:27] <%phd_in_thuggery> if he had a hard defensive option, his tech would absolutely lean on it too hard
[4:42:31] <Davimotion96> You need to be a surgeon to play Nago
[4:42:34] <Applecannon63> that parry could benefit the blood mechanic
[4:42:40] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Any character you feel it's missing something?
[4:42:41] <+DisigmaSama> Armor during blood rage could be on brand?
[4:42:44] <Vaunno> nago counter letting him stay defensive while he's keeping his thirst down? that'd be nice
[4:42:45] <floralkami> they should give some moves armor. not a counter that's Leo's schitick
[4:42:48] <+Anonymasque> Yeah it's still too early
[4:42:51] <TigerClaws12> now we wait for Go1 tech
[4:43:02] <+M08Xrd> Za warudo
[4:43:05] <+Jiggisnipe> yea it's too early to say much
[4:43:06] <rcand9> yeah its not a full picture
[4:43:10] <%1000_buffers> @WoolieVersus how long have you been growing your hair out?
[4:43:12] <+Prest0ff> the lobby system needs major work, otherwise this game is dope
[4:43:17] <+pr_illuminati> Overall I'm feeling super positive about this game now
[4:43:18] <+bustawof> Max has been pioneering crazy shit with Gio
[4:43:20] <FirewallStorm> he seems like he will be one of the nightmare characters to go against when he is piloted well
[4:43:30] <+M08Xrd> Have you tried Gio yet?
[4:43:32] <PurpleSirius> I wonder what the meta will be with the wallbreak
[4:43:34] <BaslerJones> used to be bigger didn't it ?
[4:43:35] <+Parrish_broadnax> He likes her
[4:43:36] <%ekodrop> both
[4:43:39] <Zero_The_Lazy_Pixel> Whats up my Nagos
[4:43:40] <BlackermanZX> Max is loving Gio
[4:43:40] <floralkami> this is second cut too
[4:43:40] <Meltgar> He likes both
[4:43:42] <PainterOfMiniatures> Steve is playing Leo right now
[4:43:42] <+Parrish_broadnax> Her wants to play leo later but hes loving Geo
[4:43:42] <Laveyrin> Steve is Leo
[4:43:42] <GeltonZ> XD I'm probably the only person feeling super negative about this game.
[4:43:43] <Saltmeisterr> he is
[4:43:44] <LorcaNomad> he is but geo is sick
[4:43:44] <+Kitafin> yeah
[4:43:45] <Toni_Master43> he was
[4:43:46] <pepinillomaton> thewy finished
[4:43:46] <%ECRead> he is
[4:43:46] <nailwind> the unga bunga duo
[4:43:47] <+b_aleph> he's fighting against leo rn
[4:43:47] <+discognition> He's been trying Gio
[4:43:49] <%slimmixrp> Yeah he's going on
[4:43:50] <+armor_kuma> I think he's giving Gio a go
[4:43:51] <DianaTheAscian> he is
[4:43:51] <+thackattack00> he played lots of Leo in XRD
[4:43:51] <+ProfessorThorgi> She's got a dog
[4:43:51] <PainterOfMiniatures> He just won
[4:43:51] <ullyzeez> ew
[4:43:53] <+SvenHolgersson> MAX IS READY
[4:43:54] <TheFramedWarlock> Mfw Woolie's hair is older than me
[4:43:54] <QuestionableDes> Max is a leo boy but he's loving the work he has to put into Gio
[4:43:56] <%slimmixrp> He is but he wants to try gio
[4:43:56] <Limes528> He's still a leo main
[4:43:58] <%LastHazzerd> he is and still is but he had to find out what Gio was about
[4:43:59] <TigerClaws12> well she's got a pupper
[4:43:59] <%ekodrop> ready up
[4:44:00] <MyooMyoo> He's fighting Tasty Steves leo XD
[4:44:01] <Aussie_Manny> Max is the storm that is approaching.

[4:44:03] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Leo is still scary man
[4:44:04] <floralkami> @baslerjones yeah, he cut them twice last year
[4:44:04] <MutedMimic> jiyuAzrael_HF jiyuAzrael_HF
[4:44:05] <Ai_FGC> yeah his rekka is gone
[4:44:05] <sir_nack> was he toned down? they gave him a command grab

[4:44:08] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, I absentmindedly thought "GG finals are going to be wild at EVO" and then remembered there is no more EVO FeelsBadMan
[4:44:08] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> The real question is this: Are Ramlethal and Giovanna enough to carry the R34? KappaPride
[4:44:09] <+FaderPotater> Think he said he is going to mess with Leo later this week. Wants to stick with one character today
[4:44:11] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Max plans on playing leo too he just wanted to learn gio first
[4:44:12] <MusouMiko> Leo's still a huge gorilla, Jiyuna was walking all over people last night
[4:44:13] <+CookieCutter007> The unga bunga
[4:44:14] <extradopeness> yeah he‚Äôs WORKING Steve lmao it‚Äôs almost like he knows this matchup already Kappa

[4:50:39] <%Mrbaconator> @Octopimp i can't wait to watch you grab people in pots big meaty claws
[4:50:40] <KogaNoidZX> Nago looks like he has to take a shit ton of risks
[4:50:41] <Crowroost> ASMR stream <3
[4:50:46] <%ChoculaUltra> the blood gauge management is highkey scaring me off
[4:50:49] <Octopimp> also remember that hammerfall is SAFE ON BLOCK now which is like ??????
[4:50:52] <nailwind> @Bluewolf544 my fgc experience in a nutshell
[4:50:53] <Grimsever88> isnt nagos backdash good?
[4:50:54] <%1000_buffers> @notorious_rng lmao thx
[4:50:58] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Just hit him from across the screen

[4:51:01] <+BottledLineArt> octoUnga "I'm coming for y'all."
[4:51:05] <%DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus what did the hakuman vs tager MU in BB look like?
[4:51:06] <+DizzyGunner> i feel like it would be like a street fighter match LUL
[4:51:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:51:10] <Bluewolf544> @nailwind Yeah i hate playing slow characters
[4:51:11] <RodCU> How are the other colros for Nago?
[4:51:16] <RodCU> his alts
[4:51:19] <%phd_in_thuggery> octopimp pointing at the Wrestlemania sign

[4:51:24] <nailwind> preach
[4:51:25] <TigerClaws12> @Octopimp have you seen 3 megafists combo into each other? It looks so goofy LUL
[4:51:27] <PhiZeroOne> bad, it looked bad for everyone
[4:51:34] <+Superbro64> Isnt Tager relatively mid to low in bbcf?
[4:51:35] <KogaNoidZX> Hakumen kinda stole that matchup, only thing Tager got was Spark Bolt
[4:51:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Unstoppable Force vs Immovable Object
[4:51:37] <%1000_buffers> OCTOPIMP is the wrestlemania sign
[4:51:38] <+M08Xrd> Have you tried Gio yet?
[4:51:40] <Smitteys867> Woolie cursed to have bad matchups against octopimp
[4:51:50] <raveous> I think you'll be fine, when you're in bloodrage Pot doesn't really have anything to stop you from swinging away
[4:51:51] <+TheEspada> What do you think of Nago and May MU? Dolphins catch teleports?
[4:51:53] <+MisleadingEchoes> Nago chop did an anti air by a crossup attack on Max match, that sounds like a safe b et
[4:51:55] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> What time does this beta end ?
[4:51:58] <+Jiggisnipe> he tried Gio a bit in training mode at the beginning

[4:52:35] <+Parrish_broadnax> Gio you gotta work for
[4:52:38] <%JustToWatch> Tweet from Pat "got my stick out, literally cleaned it off (caked with dust since my last DBFZ stream I think) plugged it in and loaded up Xrd, did one potemkin buster and set it down for tomorrow"
[4:52:40] <frostyjay3> *baybay
[4:52:41] <Smitteys867> If you teleport in and then bite, does the blood gague even out?
[4:52:47] <pepinillomaton> looks easy to pick but hard to mastrer
[4:52:51] <BlackermanZX> you have to work her combos
[4:52:53] <Wild_Samurai> Is Dante or Vergil in this game?
[4:52:56] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus shes also not very flashy
[4:52:56] <AfternoonConcession> max was saying she needs micro dashes and walks to get the full damage out of her @WoolieVersus
[4:52:57] <TigerClaws12> she has a lot of intricacies according to Max. Links and Micro walking @WoolieVersus
[4:52:58] <%braziliansunshine> you played against any milia?
[4:52:59] <ashuckel> she's very finicky with enemy height and stage position
[4:52:59] <%Mrbaconator> APE TOGETHER STRONG

[4:53:46] <seylumiue> She looks like one lol
[4:53:47] <+MisleadingEchoes> @RodCU shes Kim Hahahhahaha

[4:54:42] <BaslerJones> that was cool
[4:54:42] <+glgzephyr> enough

[4:55:49] <AfternoonConcession> as nago
[4:55:52] <nailwind> its the win screen sound
[4:55:55] <%1000_buffers> can he turn into a bat or something it seems like nago cannot move
[4:55:59] <extradopeness> The KNEE
[4:56:00] <+glgzephyr> wow, she really is like "Yeah my dog's cool, but I'd really rather have a jaguar"
[4:56:02] <floralkami> @michaelpleasefortheloveof all you need is money, honey.
[4:56:05] <The_Ombudsman> max is stuck

[4:56:10] <+mechslayer71> @itsgundamu I think that‚Äôs the puppo
[4:56:11] <%DeaconBluesClues> block more. you need to be learning what the punishes are.
[4:56:14] <+samsarasage> its the wolf making the noise
[4:56:17] <notorious_rng> @1000_buffers he has a dash special but its builds up blood mad fast
[4:56:24] <Sigmas18> Nago looks like he feels a lot like Hakumen.
[4:56:24] <nailwind> everyone gets that sound on win screen but the wolf amplifies it with her animaiton LUL
[4:56:28] <PhiZeroOne> that 70% sol combo in that beta promo gif where the player presses hs 6 times makes me upset
[4:56:32] <+itsgundamu> yea it still sounds like someone spit driectly into the micorphone
[4:56:35] <+glgzephyr> so I just got here. Did the beta open early for influencers or something?
[4:56:36] <RudeRabbit> SeemsGood1000 Thanks for everything you do Woolz! Getting real hyped to pick up my Samurai Vampire on day one get blown the eff out!

[4:56:52] <%Chatterbox1991> is this just London stage from SNK vs Capcom 2?
[4:56:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> I heard some people say that the command dash into kick is pretty good

[4:57:24] <pepinillomaton> Nice read
[4:57:28] <%DeaconBluesClues> how does giovanna open you up if you just block
[4:57:30] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @aikrehn there's way too many people wanting to down down and guilt people for vices . there's always a moral panic about "videogames are too X"
[4:57:32] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Yo being in blood rage with no meter looks rough lol
[4:57:36] <coracor> gettin worked
[4:57:36] <ThrillingTremors> hes plus after the flip kick special, dont challenge there
[4:57:37] <+glgzephyr> London but there are gears everywhere
[4:57:39] <Bullethead1010> Beta opened early for influencers

[4:57:52] <%paladinstarbuster> damn
[4:58:02] <+notori_osu> Bruh I love how Nago just lounges on KO lmaooooooooooo
[4:58:04] <+MisleadingEchoes> More games should have RC, such hype mechanic
[4:58:14] <Skullo_Dream> Paw shoes are questionable
[4:58:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:58:16] <frostyjay3> It is so insane how visually incredible this game looks. Like... the visuals, the effects the way the words pop on the screen and the characters is so damn nuts. I love it!!
[4:58:19] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus Feels that one of the slashes of Naigo actually places him waaay too open
[4:58:19] <Misterjablez> @notori_osu It's a Vampire Tradition
[4:58:21] <+glgzephyr> Max says Thank You
[4:58:22] <pepinillomaton> Yup, the bread and butter
[4:58:23] <Meltgar> I think the 2nd slash??
[4:58:24] <+MisleadingEchoes> @notori_osu he is a vampire, follows Slayer rules
[4:58:24] <+egalitarian696969> how very Darli
[4:58:28] <+Hayajin_> you can just hold square to fight
[4:58:31] <coracor> can you cancel out of the animation for entering rage?
[4:58:35] <+aikrehn> @michaelpleasefortheloveof oh I don't mean it like that, i just meant that literally every character looks crazy good and well designed
[4:58:39] <+notori_osu> god damn thats fantastic
[4:58:41] <+MisleadingEchoes> @coracor You can't
[4:58:44] <+glgzephyr> oh that's not good
[4:58:45] <+Hayajin_> NotLikeThis
[4:58:48] <coracor> oof
[4:59:01] <%MichaelDood> Best stage starpyGASM
[4:59:01] <+Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> rage is safe on block tho
[4:59:02] <pepinillomaton> woolieMIRIN
[4:59:08] <+MisleadingEchoes> Can't wait for people using rage in combos
[4:59:08] <+Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> so its not THAT bad
[4:59:10] <+glgzephyr> the worst part is that this lobby doesn't even have to be this bad. They just chose for it to be that way
[4:59:22] <floralkami> @coracor no, but you can make it safe by either doing it right next to your opponent, or RCing first
[4:59:26] <AfternoonConcession> mix in some grabs then bait it with a neutral jump
[4:59:28] <%MichaelDood> Knuckles?
[4:59:29] <The_Stoned_Otaku> Damn from what im seeing Gio don't need shit LUL
[4:59:32] <%DaRoosta89> holy shit its playable online

[4:59:52] <rocket_da_madman> it made sense
[4:59:53] <FpsRaptor> not samrt LUL
[4:59:53] <+Jiggisnipe> the blood the man lol
[4:59:53] <Div_the_Penguin> gotta literally combo into it
[4:59:56] <%Sweetangy021> That activation is so long
[4:59:56] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[4:59:57] <+RowenCleric> that stun is so loooong
[4:59:58] <AstrodropGaming> HahaThisisfine HahaThisisfine
[4:59:59] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @MisleadingEchoes is rage a new mechanic or are you talkinga bout Millia?
[4:59:59] <+Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> So you can potentially rage into RC then command grab to reduce the blood meter faster?\
[5:00:04] <+shinobi_magi> You gotta suck that blood bud
[5:00:05] <+b_aleph> kick momma gas a date with your ass
[5:00:05] <+Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> im really curious
[5:00:05] <huskarl_zap> BLOOD BUFF : ACTIV- FINAL DEATH
[5:00:07] <%gitgouda> does anyone know when strive comes out? ive been meaning to try out a guilty gear game but wasnt sure if i should play xrd or just wait.
[5:00:15] <+MisleadingEchoes> @michaelpleasefortheloveof Rage is nago blood rage, if the bar fills he explodes
[5:00:19] <Grimsever88> early april
[5:00:25] <KogaNoidZX> Yeah, if you can RC Blood Rage then Nago would be alright but if it's a committment then oof
[5:00:26] <JonnyJonstar> whats the score?
[5:00:28] <floralkami> @ghostfrom3rdstrike_ *RC into rage
[5:00:30] <DedlokPM> @gitgouda april iirc
[5:00:31] <kaine_west> is this the Pre-order Open beta?
[5:00:36] <Meltgar> Damg, does naigo has an anti-air??
[5:00:37] <+AJ_Cherenkov> So blood rage is just never something you want to happen, I gather.
[5:00:38] <+Superbro64> @jonnyjonstar oof and ouch
[5:00:38] <+glgzephyr> Gio's air game is looking NICE
[5:00:39] <+zalonar> gio is a mixup monster

[5:00:50] <+almightychad> to be fair @WoolieVersus , he was fighting almost nothing but Nago's last night
[5:00:52] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Meltgar his best air looks like the "chop" which is really short
[5:00:52] <Sigmas18> @gitgouda Accent Core is usually on sale for super cheap, it's okay for getting you started
[5:00:54] <kaine_west> @dedlokpm thanks!
[5:00:54] <floralkami> @gitgouda April
[5:00:55] <%DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus your damage is coming from throws, antiairs, projectile, and his are all from whiff punishes. you need to press way less buttons and let him do something stupid on oppression
[5:00:57] <extradopeness> THE KNEE OF TRUTH
[5:00:58] <PainterOfMiniatures> He just got up rated
[5:00:58] <+M08Xrd> My blood NotLikeThis

[5:01:49] <+Ghostfrom3rdstrike_> ngl Max has been making Gio look crazy
[5:02:03] <Sigmas18> @gitgouda if there's a price issue yeah. if you already have Xrd it's also good. the Tutorial is way better.
[5:02:03] <floralkami> @misleadingechoes no, people just wanna try certain characters first
[5:02:07] <+tigerarar> hey do you get free special moves after the command grab because the blood is going down
[5:02:07] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Doughnut_Slayer Is Dr Baldman the same character as Faust?
[5:02:15] <Grimsever88> +r over xrd because +r has godlike netcode
[5:02:15] <KogaNoidZX> Yeah he is

[5:11:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ooof it kicked you out
[5:11:20] <ullyzeez> lost too much LUL
[5:11:20] <rcand9> max got the good luck
[5:11:21] <+Parrish_broadnax> its cause it kicked you
[5:11:22] <KericInfinitum> Maybe cause you got fully backed out
[5:11:23] <Bluewolf544> Oh no NotLikeThis
[5:11:24] <huskarl_zap> Shill version privilege
[5:11:25] <+MisleadingEchoes> @WoolieVersus close and open the game, hard close
[5:11:25] <TigerClaws12> Max didn't confirm the exit during the match
[5:11:26] <floralkami> @soushinsen it will choose in 5 minutes for them @woolieversus
[5:11:27] <pepinillomaton> reset?
[5:11:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> Max didnt get kicked so he can lab
[5:11:29] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Arcsys hates Nago players confirmed
[5:11:30] <Cosairen> @Chatterbox1991 he got one match with jwongs may and lost
[5:11:31] <Afroperonista> he has more subs that's why
[5:11:31] <KericInfinitum> Max was still in the menus
[5:11:33] <BlackermanZX> i guess you got fully kicked out
[5:11:34] <+nekodelic> nah, he played your nago
[5:11:36] <el_sloth> lasted longer Kreygasm
[5:11:39] <novak_v> is anyone playing chipp?
[5:11:39] <Aramonde_San> Influencer level isn't high enough
[5:11:40] <+asgard147> maybe cos he was on the menu? limesThink
[5:11:41] <%gatorafan> Obama becoming the super villain he was always meant to be Kappa
[5:11:44] <%Chatterbox1991> wow Racist ass maintenance
[5:11:50] <+freystreams> @WoolieVersus are you thinking of playing GG Strive casually or serious?
[5:11:52] <floralkami> @woolieversus they will get kicked out soon too
[5:11:53] <DianaTheAscian> maybe time zones? @WoolieVersus
[5:11:54] <+thedream_c> woolie rite tho
[5:11:54] <Applecannon63> he is playing the dummy of Woolie's player
[5:11:55] <ullyzeez> not hyper enough
[5:12:00] <+thedream_c> Nago is all about the badtouch
[5:12:02] <Bluewolf544> Hifight was doing a LOT per touch
[5:12:04] <+thedream_c> very calculated
[5:12:14] <rcand9> big deadly touch
[5:12:14] <pepinillomaton> big oof
[5:12:16] <+ArkadeNoah> He's well beyond the dummy of woolie's character. He's in the actual lab now
[5:12:21] <lotharaxe> Max is in the training mode
[5:12:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:12:22] <+thedream_c> and putting your opponent in checkmate situations when u have the life lead
[5:12:23] <mariosonicboss> so nago is the last blade/samsho of GG
[5:12:25] <+thedream_c> at the corner
[5:12:26] <+kidcoheed> the Netcode didn't look like trash
[5:12:27] <huskarl_zap> We now know who has the shill versions
[5:12:28] <Meltgar> When you landed the slashes how much damage you did? Half?
[5:12:30] <extradopeness> damn wtf
[5:12:30] <+Superbro64> if your low on life with nago, is the gameplan then to go "fuck it" dash cancel to blood rage, and yolo batter up? @woolieversus
[5:12:32] <+glgzephyr> I think I will probably end up roiling Potemkin. His grabs are just too satisfying
[5:12:38] <+HibikiYamada> how was the netcode? I missed all of it because Texas is frozen over
[5:12:41] <Klefth> That just means
[5:12:42] <Applecannon63> @lotharaxe Max is playing a dummy of Woolie's main
[5:12:42] <+thedream_c> also the nago DP type super is very versatile
[5:12:45] <%ChoculaUltra> netcode was fantastic looking. 1 frame delay with Max who's out in Cali
[5:12:45] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> You see yourself participating into Strive tourneys when the game comes out?
[5:12:47] <Klefth> We need more real Nago hours boys
[5:12:55] <%jaggstar2020> Release the frame data
[5:12:56] <+ArkadeNoah> @Applecannon63 He's not
[5:12:59] <floralkami> @superbro64 no dashes, but yes
[5:13:01] <Applecannon63> ah
[5:13:04] <+thedream_c> just hope its not stupid good Anji
[5:13:05] <lotharaxe> @Applecannon63 He is in the training mode now, that is old news.
[5:13:07] <Evendrag> the man himself
[5:13:07] <@SoushinSen> Bridget, let's go
[5:13:08] <huskarl_zap> Its gonna be Bridget
[5:13:09] <%gatorafan> I eagerly await tomorrow's Nago hours
[5:13:09] <Afroperonista> Kazama? nice
[5:13:10] <el_sloth> harbThink
[5:13:10] <Grimsever88> Nascar R Cruz
[5:13:11] <Cosairen> @HibikiYamada woolie was playing people from japan with no problems
[5:13:12] <%DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus how generous is the range on his 623 + P command grab? can you use it to punish shit on block?

[5:13:43] <stabbityrabbit> Nah, Ariels. Asuka DLC.
[5:13:44] <floralkami> @superbro64 that's what I meant. no specials besides bite
[5:13:46] <+Cactuskris> another cat boy
[5:13:48] <alephalpha> but the I-no stinger htough
[5:13:50] <+thedream_c> I feel I-No is kinda weird with a smaller sized stage
[5:13:52] <%gatorafan> a Man and That Man duel
[5:13:53] <townzzzzz> nah, it's going to be CHIMAKI
[5:13:56] <extradopeness> It‚Äôs gonna be ZAPPA
[5:13:56] <NegaHarbinger> That man dlc for season pass
[5:13:57] <BlackermanZX> another twink sol has to beat up
[5:13:59] <+thedream_c> so she's gonna change MUCH if she makes it into the game somehow
[5:14:00] <OkamiDude15> woolie spoiling GG lore NotLikeThis
[5:14:01] <+PeaceCentennial> It could be Aria in her true form, which would be super neat considering how many versions of her have been in Guilty Gear
[5:14:07] <GhostRavens> i just realized. what happened to i-no?
[5:14:12] <Vaunno> All my homies hate Ariels
[5:14:12] <+thedream_c> I'd love Robo KY tho
[5:14:12] <caja_de_ojos> that man?
[5:14:14] <ullyzeez> i hope its goku
[5:14:15] <Meltgar> Last character will be LEOPALDON and everyone will respect him Kappa
[5:14:16] <rcand9> if you still had time to get "in" on fighting games still would you see yourself going all in on strive?
[5:14:17] <extradopeness> just kidding pls don‚Äôt put zappa I

[5:14:22] <+Asuo_> I really want Zappa but that's never gonna happen
[5:14:24] <extradopeness> In*
[5:14:24] <+kennneh> @WoolieVersus Who do you think is missing from the base roster?
[5:14:24] <alephalpha> yeah I-no looping note would eb unnaceptable ins tirve
[5:14:27] <+thedream_c> Robo Ky is the kind of gentleman that is worth being in this game
[5:14:38] <+thedream_c> and maybe BedGirl
[5:14:41] <OkamiDude15> yall read for 15 to be kiryu Kappa
[5:14:41] <ketchuo13> Well Max just got kicked out the beta
[5:14:41] <RudeRabbit> Last Character is Bridget and she slaps you with that Alsolfo dick

[5:14:49] <Meltgar> LUL Max finally got "fully" kicked out the beta LUL
[5:14:50] <%JustToWatch> lol Max just got kicked
[5:14:50] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> You see any chances of my boy raven coming back?
[5:14:52] <Applecannon63> isn't Robo KY Converted into something?
[5:14:52] <GnarlyBreadGod> aria in a justice mech
[5:14:53] <+PeaceCentennial> She could be a fucked up mashup of Justice and Jack-O
[5:14:53] <+Superbro64> @woolieversus if your low on life with nago, do you just go "fuck it" build up blood, and yolo batter up?
[5:14:55] <mariosonicboss> or jack-o
[5:14:56] <Radioactivetaco9> Aria with a justice install
[5:14:57] <%drefizz> it would have to be the clone of jacko
[5:14:57] <chll0ne> if its elphet im gonna be so disappointed
[5:14:57] <Grimsever88> Bridget but been on a gym kick
[5:14:57] <+thedream_c> Bedgirl with 8way dash in STRIVE sounds nutty but acceptable
[5:14:58] <%gatorafan> @thedream_c, does Robo-Ky also get ripped like his source?
[5:15:00] <stabbityrabbit> Universal Will, gotta be
[5:15:03] <Unnoble> it gonna be Kirby
[5:15:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> IZUNA
[5:15:04] <BlackermanZX> Aria would be cool
[5:15:10] <Bluewolf544> Sin is just cooler ky
[5:15:12] <cheap_turbo> JUSTICE
[5:15:13] <KogaNoidZX> @WoolieVersus Have you tried RC'ing Nago's Blood Rage? If he could do that it'd be omega cheap but maybe it wouldn't be a full committment
[5:15:13] <mrwarmachine> I'm hoping for Jam ngl
[5:15:14] <%ChoculaUltra> last character is going to be Zombie Kliff Kappa
[5:15:14] <delerim001> She has jack-o body she can do whatever
[5:15:16] <Jashter18> Aria as good Justice would be fire
[5:15:16] <%ggbhtg> woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE woolieLORE
[5:15:17] <Toni_Master43> Sin is DLC yeah
[5:15:19] <Meltgar> IZUNA, JUSTICE, Testament
[5:15:19] <Grimsever88> buff bridget
[5:15:22] <%DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus if that's true, one possible simple thing to try is empty jump in the command grab, and then empty jump into anti air normals once you've landed it once or twice.
[5:15:22] <ullyzeez> literally who woolie
[5:15:25] <caja_de_ojos> she is Technically a gear
[5:15:25] <Applecannon63> Sin will be DLC definitely
[5:15:26] <+Mutraex> some combination of Justice nukes and Jack-O spawns
[5:15:26] <Cosairen> imagine 50% counterhit beat drivers lmao
[5:15:27] <cheap_turbo> GIVE ME JUSTICE
[5:15:29] <NegaHarbinger> Doesnt Aria have Jacko memories
[5:15:29] <%phd_in_thuggery> if it's Jack-O I'm fucking leaving fighting games. And I MAIN her!
[5:15:31] <GhostRavens> what's the name of potemkin's superior? he would be cool
[5:15:35] <%paladinstarbuster> yes
[5:15:38] <+DisigmaSama> Gabriel
[5:15:40] <Toni_Master43> Paradigm should be Tutorial instructor imo
[5:15:40] <lazyagus> Aria will be able to throw misiles from her boobs
[5:15:41] <%keiji_maede> no training? o.o
[5:15:47] <Vaunno> Gabriel is the xepp guy
[5:15:48] <umm_idunno> can you dash cancel in blood rage?
[5:15:49] <Vaunno> zepp
[5:15:51] <+thedream_c> I mean Jack-O can make it in and play VERY differently than her REV counterpart
[5:15:55] <Bluewolf544> You can combo into his pop though so there might be all in tech
[5:15:58] <Meltgar> @keiji_maede Beta kicks him out full, can't even enter the menu
[5:16:02] <+colezone_> is it viable to just get the blood super out ASAP when you pop
[5:16:10] <extradopeness> I love me some jack-o man
[5:16:17] <+thedream_c> like i don't think Ram's 'basic string' play style is present in Strive
[5:16:21] <+thedream_c> so she's sorta reworked a bit
[5:16:21] <+AtomicUdon> Wouldn't Aria as good Justice mirror Blazblue and Noell? o.o
[5:16:22] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, Ram and Leo are p different from their Xrd incarnations
[5:16:32] <+Superbro64> thanks for the answer woolie doodGood
[5:16:37] <+thedream_c> Leo lost rekka, but gained new things and STRIVE favors him it sems
[5:16:43] <%phd_in_thuggery> You gotta have something to hold the Gimmick up with dressing @woolieversus
[5:16:48] <neet98> but like Asuka is not even the bad guy right? Sol hate him but he's not the villain
[5:16:50] <%ashgray2520> @woolieversus Doesn't the command grab TECHNICALLY give you some free/cheaper special moves? Might be worth trying to work it in to blockstrings along with a good jump-catcher for 50/50s.
[5:16:51] <Picia000123> Axl's time stop seems hype without the baggage of being a burden to your kit
[5:16:52] <+thedream_c> imagine Leo cna still do his bakcturn movement stuff, but the stage is smaller
[5:16:56] <Crowroost> @WoolieVersus All Roads Eventually Lead To Darli
[5:16:56] <%ChoculaUltra> it's crazy that Ram can only call her swords back on super but she still looks p fun
[5:16:59] <Applecannon63> Leo from a lion now became a gorilla
[5:17:15] <+Superbro64> so galactica phantom is the only true gimmick move then? @woolieversus
[5:17:17] <ullyzeez> @choculaultra she can pick them up
[5:17:20] <floralkami> @applecannon63 you don't know LEO, then
[5:17:20] <+thedream_c> Pot I think may be a lil more dangerous with the smaller stage
[5:17:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> i've been wondering if we will see Bedman's sister as a character, due to the ending in Xrd Revelation
[5:17:32] <+thedream_c> BedSiblings :p
[5:17:32] <%ChoculaUltra> she can pick them up but not like jedi pull them back to her I mean LUL
[5:17:38] <+thedream_c> Sin's beak driver is BS
[5:17:46] <Applecannon63> I mean Leo having a command grab is gorilla much
[5:17:47] <bobxmaker> what i noticed about nagos transform is that he explodes and pushes the enemy to the other side of the screen if they are close, so maybe plan around that?
[5:17:50] <+b_aleph> you can? How? Staggered foe?
[5:17:50] <+thedream_c> 75% screen cover hurtbox psuedo projectiles :p
[5:17:56] <jorniev> too much of a weakness to be a double edged sword?
[5:17:58] <+AtomicUdon> I imagine Raven will be coming back for absolutely sure.
[5:18:00] <Cosairen> yeah you can do 5 drivers for like 90%
[5:18:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[5:18:04] <floralkami> @applecannon63 Leo is a gorilla in a shoddy lion suit
