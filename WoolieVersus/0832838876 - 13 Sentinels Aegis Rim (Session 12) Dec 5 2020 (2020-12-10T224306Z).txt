[0:17:16] <gulthrax> i was convinced that i was the only human to have played this beast ass pimp dawg of a game, bruh
[0:17:24] <%Weeewer> Woolie youre kicking ass with this LP. Your mind break moments are delicious
[0:17:32] <jorniev> ITS SO NUTS
[0:17:38] <Kghaleon> Looking forward to battle 2-10.
[0:17:57] <jorniev> IM LOSING MY SHIT every session at least 3 times
[0:17:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Plotgun is fun
[0:18:03] <%RyTYoung> Yeah it sets you up to fail in what to expect which is great
[0:18:08] <%Weeewer> I think the game is genious because its so dense that not every plot point explains other stories
[0:18:23] <%Weeewer> Some stuff is totally unrelated to another character in many ways and I think thats cool
[0:18:34] <Zeppelee> This game is basically Pacific Rim meets Automata meets MGS2.
[0:18:35] <gulthrax> Virtue's last reward is like this game with the mind fucks, homie
[0:18:35] <+Amaideus> It's like if Soulsborne Lore actually mattered in gameplay
[0:19:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I love how calm and composed Woolie is rn. The calm before the storm LUL
[0:19:03] <+MetroidPrimeRib> if you read one piece its like that but it takes 30 years
[0:19:03] <%Weeewer> I think this game edges out even VLR in mind fucks since VLR is so back loaded with a lot of that, though theyre both great mysteries
[0:19:12] <T_Sasquatch> I really like Wan
[0:19:12] <phatmac16> The Nen system is also great
[0:19:13] <ColbyBryant> it wasnt the worst part of korra, ill give it that
[0:19:15] <gulthrax> who was your waifu tho!?
[0:19:25] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Has woolie said if he finished Korra or not?
[0:19:28] <%Klefth> Hard magic systems are fun
[0:19:29] <+kattspike> What the explanation is fucking radical and makes so much sense and it totally is magic
[0:19:35] <%Klefth> @ZoltanBMagnus He has, and he did
[0:19:37] <@akuda_bar> yeah most of the mind fucks in vlr are in the end, but the mind fucks are meta ass brain melt mind fucks
[0:19:40] <Zeppelee> I didn't like Korra at all, but to each their own.
[0:19:43] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @Klefth ok thanks
[0:19:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:19:45] <+skyheys> just because its explained doesnt mean the explanation is good Kappa
[0:19:46] <%SkellyVee> waoPog waoPog waoPog
[0:19:52] <%Weeewer> thats wholesome af
[0:20:02] <phatmac16> I also cared more about the charcters in VLR than in this game

[0:20:28] <gulthrax> @phatmac16 fo sho, that game is so crazy
[0:20:28] <+cvp5127> its offensive to blind people
[0:20:29] <quietshun> blind is offensive apparently
[0:20:29] <@akuda_bar> ableisk*
[0:20:29] <%Afterman_> they are saying it is ableist language
[0:20:29] <MyNameIsRasus> ableism
[0:20:29] <%DashXero> It's been ruled as offensive to blind people.
[0:20:30] <tattleworm> the phrase "blind playthrough" is now considered problematic
[0:20:30] <Futurecity10> @WoolieVersus They banned the Blind Playthrough tag
[0:20:30] <%arancet> they think "blind" playthrough is offensive now.... somehow
[0:20:32] <%shaidot> Thanks for the 2020Delivery @wardogleader15
[0:20:33] <mortificent> Maybe Ableist
[0:20:36] <%Afterman_> @wardogleader15 Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:20:36] <T_Sasquatch> Blind playthrough is now offensives LUL
[0:20:36] <@akuda_bar> fucking autocorrect
[0:20:39] <%wibbwobbler> "blind playthroughs" are a no no
[0:20:43] <phatmac16> Blind is offensive now
[0:20:44] <%Klefth> Oh boy
[0:20:46] <+Ez3z> he's talking out his ass, they just changed the term "blind" playthroughs for some reason
[0:20:47] <SomersaultJustice> so what do they call them now?
[0:20:47] <HeroToxiko> What
[0:20:51] <reonome> they won't ban you wooliz
[0:20:52] <quietshun> Big stupid from twitch

[0:21:02] <+MetroidPrimeRib> it's a medical diagnosis I dunno what to tell them

[0:21:10] <reonome> they just removed blind playthrough, they're not gonna ban you
[0:21:12] <%Weeewer> You should use "FIRST TIME" or something if you really have to
[0:21:12] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus they're not banning anybody, they just removed the stream tag
[0:21:14] <bunnicco> probably it's twitch afterall lol
[0:21:17] <SomersaultJustice> MYSTERIOUS PLAYTHROUGH
[0:21:20] <%JoeyStar> hot damn thank you @wardogleader15 for the gift subs!!
[0:21:20] <+BigCoffee> Sadly yes, it's a new thing from literally today
[0:21:20] <@akuda_bar> they only care about you using it in a tag, and it's not a bannable offense @woolieversus
[0:21:20] <HeroToxiko> how would they even see the word to be offended by it?
[0:21:20] <T_Sasquatch> How dare you be reasonable
[0:21:21] <MyNameIsRasus> they want you to replace it with "first playthrough" and so on
[0:21:23] <phatmac16> They removed the option on twitch
[0:21:23] <%Klefth> Why are we turning languages into minefields like this...?
[0:21:29] <reonome> they suspended vinny because of titty
[0:21:29] <andrewofbob> This sounds as stupid as saying “black hole” is a racist term.
