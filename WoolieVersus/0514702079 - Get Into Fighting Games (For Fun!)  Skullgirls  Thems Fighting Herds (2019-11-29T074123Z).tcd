[0:24:10] <arkv01> fuckin love me some big tiddy nurse gf Kreygasm
[0:24:18] <gotanysnacks> no way, Baz Beo
[0:24:36] <pillowwasp> How about that Capcom announcement coming at that jump event
[0:24:49] <%RVMSpeedWagon> The Baz is their hero no one wants or needs, but everyone loves.
[0:24:49] <gotanysnacks> It'll be RE3 or something MonHun
[0:24:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Beo has a lot of good colors
[0:24:57] <arkv01> Jump Force X SF?
[0:25:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> what's call about the Raven skin is that when Eliza does the moves that call out those other gods, they are green like beast boy
[0:25:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont know if it'll be a fighting game I kinda doubt it tbh
[0:25:09] <pillowwasp> Hoping for RE3 or Dragons dogma 2
[0:25:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> cool*
[0:25:15] <kikosmore> are the on steam?
[0:25:18] <%gatorafan> I'm not sure how hyped I should be for that. Considering is at Jump festa I guess it's safe to assume it's related to Jump.
[0:25:20] <preppyposs> i swear to god if jump force wins best fighting game,....
[0:25:30] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @preppyposs lol it will not
[0:25:35] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> There's not even a chance
[0:25:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @preppyposs I will cry big time
[0:25:43] <+spaghetti_shaman> Have sexy time with Eliza. Get HIV.
[0:25:44] <RyuuAoi> Just use SF contols, Reggie...
[0:25:49] <pillowwasp> Smash will probably win
[0:25:54] <ggbhtg> @gatorafan that means nothing, kingdom hearts 3 news was announced every year
[0:25:56] <preppyposs> I don't have hope in the greater gaming community
[0:25:57] <TheBrunoZone> Even tho, it being nominated is already an insult
[0:26:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'll make sure jump force doesnt win just like I made sure doom guy wont get in smash
[0:26:02] <%Polter_ge1st> HP for Lag
[0:26:07] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> MK11 will likely win or Smush
[0:26:11] <Djinnazz> oh shit, you guys are still here
[0:26:16] <Asuterisuku> Jump Force nominated over Kill la Kill: IF
[0:26:17] <Onjani> imagine not voting for jump force LUL
[0:26:17] <preppyposs> Smash winning is not a surprise
[0:26:18] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> As much as I love SamSho, it doesn't have the ridiculous WB money behind it
[0:26:18] <misc_mer> Doomguy for Jumpforce then
[0:26:20] <%Polter_ge1st> Heavy Punch for lag
[0:26:30] <Jack_Onee_san> hey @solidus_113 get the skullheart beginner guide going in chat if you can?

[0:26:40] <moooglins> Imagine thinking jump force isn't the greatest fighting game ever
[0:26:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> A L E X
[0:26:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @onjani that's a joke....right?
[0:26:42] <hamsalad404> I don't get why people ask for doomguy or outlandish characters for smash,and be like really convinced they'll be added

[0:53:40] <ggbhtg> OOP aaaaw
[0:53:41] <Cobalt_ex> he's getting a little better at using movement options to close in on peacock
[0:53:47] <DSD24> This is a test

[0:54:46] <$Kekon3> Point Peacock - Hornet Bomber Assist Double
[0:55:03] <DSD24> @Jontman42 That's Ms Fortune's gimmick
[0:55:05] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:55:10] <fluke_LKZ> @Jontman42 Her head is used for combos, and her normals attack change when you throw/keep it
[0:55:13] <gryffinp> I just opened the stream, which one of them is the monster playing Peacock
[0:55:18] <DSD24> Woolie
[0:55:20] <StarkMaximum> @gryffinp you KNOW it's Woolie
[0:55:20] <himbearbedtime> wools

[0:55:32] <Djinnazz> She's a Looney Toons
[0:55:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOW MANY ATTACKS DOES SHE HAVE?
[0:55:41] <%blaccbird914> I better see peacocks throw super at least once
[0:55:42] <DSD24> Hero's play Peacock
[0:55:43] <Cobalt_ex> so many almost happy birthdays
[0:55:44] <StarkMaximum> To be fair, Reggie ASKED him to pull out Peacock because he wanted to learn how to become fireproof by lighting himself on fire
[0:55:45] <Jontman42> I appreciate using the head as a separate means of attack
[0:55:45] <+Joe2187> Are they playing PC or PS4?

[0:55:59] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> man, Ms. Fortune is my least favorite character among the skullgirls cast, and Robo-fortune is SO much more charming.

[0:56:01] <RyuuAoi> Good team, @woolieversus
[0:56:03] <$Kekon3> the big thing I remember from Skullgirls during its active updates was the Fukua Era and the beginning of the Eliza era
[0:56:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh shit skullgirls is alive?
[0:56:15] <+WhimsiKarren> Skullgirls spoiled me with Peacock because no other fighter has ever given me anyone as fun to play D=

[0:58:10] <animecupz> are these the combo trials or just the character overviews?
[0:58:12] <ggbhtg> she has good head
[0:58:21] <kikosmore> Is there a way to switch the trials combos from showing the move name to actually showing the input?
[0:58:22] <Camail> also if they combo you and your head it HURTS
[0:58:25] <gryffinp> As much as indivisible was not amazing I do hope it succeded well enough to enable lab zero to make a new fighting game and/or skullgirls 2
[0:58:37] <DSD24> Characters only improve when they make puns
[0:58:38] <Mpgame99> There’s combo trials but you have to buy them with the 2nd encore dlc
[0:58:53] <$Kekon3> yeah, ps4 its packed in but 2nd encore is a dlc on steam
[0:58:59] <Camail> or just back the kickstarted years ago and get it all for free LUL

[0:59:09] <+Vestillion> BEST GURL
[0:59:18] <haidanort> YES BEST GIRL
[0:59:19] <mr_miyagucci> @animecupz just character overview trials are on the second encore upgrade which steam sells separately from the game so you have to buy the base then upgrade rather than buying second encore like you can on say switch
[0:59:23] <$Kekon3> Didn't get second encore when I backed FeelsBadMan
[0:59:26] <a_mad_dragon> no, an hour with HEAD SEPERATED
[0:59:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> VALENTINE DID NOTHING WRONG
[0:59:34] <$Kekon3> just base steam version FeelsBadMan
[0:59:34] <Mpgame99> Yeah second encore wasn’t for backers
[0:59:36] <a_mad_dragon> so probably 2-3 hours total
[0:59:43] <Naughta_Noob> That info is a hint for Achievements
[0:59:47] <Mpgame99> You have to pay for it regardless
[0:59:53] <AgentCH> The "1 hour with her head detached" thing is how to get her unique achievement
[1:00:00] <+JMDurden> Base game doesn't have combo trials. 2nd Encore DLC does.
[1:00:01] <BlackermanZX> She kinda has wolverine attacks
[1:00:03] <%hntronium> upgrade is on sale for 70% off right now
[1:00:10] <Solidus0101> it's also a hint for a trophy/achievement
[1:00:12] <$Kekon3> I did appreciate getting fixed skullgirls for already owning Konami Skullgirls tho
[1:00:18] <+Vestillion> headless MF is real hard
[1:00:20] <$Kekon3> that shit was tight, but I was ready to pay again
[1:00:22] <AgentCH> All the base game characters have a hint like that in their character tutorials

[2:38:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> MLP
[2:38:11] <Solidnick18> yep
[2:38:13] <+TungstenViper> them's FIGHTIN' NERDS
[2:38:14] <+Zyquux> RIP Fighting is Magic
[2:38:14] <Coylie3> They got a CnD from Hasbro, I've been following this for a long time
[2:38:17] <+Malaspas> That was some marinating vengeance...
[2:38:19] <Shardlab> This is how you fan game
[2:38:20] <ristos237> Fighting is Magic PepeHands
[2:38:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> damn Hasbro
[2:38:22] <NiktenKing> dynamic leader music is amazing
[2:38:23] <+TheRealHamit> manesi1Velfeelsgood manesi1Velfeelsgood manesi1Velfeelsgood
[2:38:26] <hamsalad404> why so little people play Skullgirls and lethal league blaze
[2:38:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> lauren faust made the characters, the creator of mlpfim
[2:38:32] <NeroInfinite> Yeah they got CnD'd by hasboro
[2:38:33] <Shardlab> ___ with blackjack and hookers
[2:38:36] <%yeknomlive> you can see the paralels to each character
[2:38:44] <artificiallynatural> Faust helped with this game!?
[2:38:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> lauren faust and a bunch of VA's hopped in cause they love it
[2:38:50] <%gatorafan> manesi1Velfeelsgood woolieGASM
[2:38:50] <ggbhtg> It literally stated because some body put some fighting game huds over screenshots years ago
[2:38:53] <RadShiro> The music is BUMPIN so far PogChamp
[2:38:53] <Shardlab> She designed the characters
[2:38:56] <NeroInfinite> Faust did the character designs
[2:38:58] <@Solidus_113> The CnD came from Fighting Is Magic getting into EVO, and Hasbro catching on randomly about the game getting entered for a pot bonus
[2:38:59] <NiktenKing> Faust did the designs and the setting
[2:39:01] <+Zyquux> The Fighting is Magic music is amazing.
[2:39:03] <bazz_tv> like this game has a dyanimc soundtrack that takes on account which characters is fighting who, if characters are active or standing, who is winning and which round is it
[2:39:05] <EspurWick> Heard of this game and it looks cool
[2:39:13] <Pyroco101> I hear those exact same trumpet samples in this background music
[2:39:14] <biomegabear> Is this game finished?
[2:39:15] <+Toa697> this should be fun to watch
[2:39:19] <@Solidus_113> This is not finished
[2:39:20] <ggbhtg> It literally started because some body put some fighting game huds over screenshots years ago @woolieversus
[2:39:21] <bazz_tv> which means each theme has a fuck ton of variations
[2:39:23] <@Solidus_113> it's still EA
[2:39:29] <Asuterisuku> I'm much more comfortable in this game than I am in SG
[2:39:37] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @TheDeadpoolDash
[2:39:44] <biomegabear> @Solidus_113 is it more finished than the last time it was played on FFF
[2:39:48] <CamTSB> It's push to talk, don't worry too much there
[2:39:48] <bazz_tv> even the select screen has dyanmic themes
[2:39:52] <@Solidus_113> The devs are still working on story mode and lvl 3 supers for 1.0 release
[2:40:04] <oscarglez93> This game is pretty much SG but no team bs, only true skill allowed
[2:40:04] <MKII> oleander gud, air jump cancelling gud
[2:40:08] <+R_BChe> whats the date for 1.0 release? or is that tbd

[2:48:10] <%Buttface_> I love how they immediately noticed how the input priority works
[2:48:13] <grovertoast> 4
[2:48:13] <YiffyShonryu> 4.
[2:48:13] <%Buttface_> 4 buttons
[2:48:17] <Yifferboi> nice
[2:48:17] <Asuterisuku> Four button game.
[2:48:23] <YiffyShonryu> L, M, H, S.
[2:48:28] <bazz_tv> and anima notations
[2:48:32] <bazz_tv> anime
[2:48:34] <Junkles> 4 legs, 4 buttons
[2:48:39] <YiffyShonryu> ^nah
[2:48:41] <YiffyShonryu> Lol
[2:48:42] <KeystoneDefiant> More like... moonique. Right? Right?? Right.
[2:48:44] <CamTSB> it's just a buffer thing @WoolieVersus
[2:48:45] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus @camtsb is a dev bros, we gottem
[2:48:51] <bazz_tv> basically you are playing Jojo Heritage for the Future
[2:48:53] <WackyModder84> I still have MLP Fighting is Magic, and I still play it just as much as this game. #NeverForget
[2:48:55] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> "lets call it light and heavy" next sentence " a + b"
[2:49:01] <UnfilteredComic> Youre buffering
[2:49:15] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Cow is based on Rekkas, Reggie
[2:49:19] <CamTSB> ye, just buffering the next normal
[2:49:25] <KyrenGraves> Hell yeah TFH
[2:49:25] <Asuterisuku> B+C is more reliable for throw, I've found.
[2:49:33] <@Solidus_113> The combo system is very freeform. Easiest thing to do L-M-H-Launcher to air L-M-H
[2:49:35] <%Buttface_> that's because B+C is the throw input
[2:49:35] <CamTSB> B+C is throw, yes.
[2:50:00] <CamTSB> GOD I love watching fighting game players just UNDERSTAND stuff
[2:50:01] <Yifferboi> like gattling around the face buttons in BlazBlu
[2:50:02] <ggbhtg> We got Filia stuffs
[2:50:06] <bazz_tv> @Solidus_113 so magic series basically
[2:50:22] <@Solidus_113> yes, but not everyone can use the magic button to combo
[2:50:29] <ggbhtg> we got parasouls
[2:50:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:50:32] <TigerClaws12> quite literally, Mag-fucking-neto
[2:50:35] <Naughta_Noob> I'd reccomend looking up move lists, D button has some odd inputs for a 2d game
[2:50:56] <Finchit> Oh shit this game is my jam
[2:51:16] <@CrankyVT> Oh yo, never thought I'd see poeple playing this again
[2:51:20] <CamTSB> Tianhuo has 8-way magic uses @WoolieVersus
[2:51:32] <DSD24> @Cranky_Construct Hi Cranky!
[2:51:35] <ggbhtg> @cranky_construct we gotta Get In
[2:51:45] <Asuterisuku> Firecracker unfortunately does not combo into itself.
[2:51:49] <@CrankyVT> hey dsd, ggbhtg. I legit forgot this game existed for a moment there
[2:51:49] <CamTSB> haha
[2:51:49] <+PMAvers> The stomp on Arizona is fun to use as well. It's like down down and any of the attacks to determine range.
[2:51:50] <b_ikki> how did he go straight for the character with blanka balls
[2:51:57] <SheefEatsBeef> ^
[2:52:03] <DSD24> Its green
[2:52:04] <+vaporousTippler> He's just naturally attracted to those balls.
[2:52:09] <DSD24> So he knows
[2:52:14] <ggbhtg> he already knew about tian
[2:52:21] <+Zyquux> C R A C K
[2:52:22] <ggbhtg> reggie is the newborn
[2:52:22] <Stichez> You do have unique air throws too
[2:52:30] <+TheRealHamit> Cow-oh-eff
[2:52:34] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> also, they have different movement @WoolieVersus . Only cow has short hops. Tianhuo has air dashes
[2:52:39] <40_bass> short hop only for Arizona and Paprika
[2:52:44] <CamTSB> Movement stuff is character specific.
[2:52:49] <Asuterisuku> Pap has shorthops too, doesn't she?
[2:52:50] <JeoDood> ^
[2:52:50] <Camail> some character dont have jump options
[2:52:51] <oscarglez93> only Arizona and Paprika have short hops
[2:52:52] <YiffyShonryu> Paprika and Arizona both have short hops.
[2:52:55] <Camail> paprika has it too
[2:52:55] <ggbhtg> isnt that Short Jump in KOF?
[2:53:01] <+vaporousTippler> Does that mean some run while others dash?
[2:53:04] <bazz_tv> Tianhuo can fly
[2:53:06] <%Buttface_> yes
[2:53:09] <%Buttface_> most dash
[2:53:12] <YiffyShonryu> Tina has free flight though.
[2:53:15] <Asuterisuku> Ari runs.
[2:53:17] <%Buttface_> cow can run
[2:53:22] <Yifferboi> how's everyone doing?
[2:53:26] <oscarglez93> Tianhuo and Pom have an aerial dash
[2:53:33] <YiffyShonryu> QCF+2 buttons.
[2:53:37] <+zzNamttamzz> the hops on that cow
[2:53:39] <%yeknomlive> oh ok. i was only playing that twilight girl and she could only do short dashes
[2:53:45] <CamTSB> just let them work through stuff.
[2:53:46] <CopperTucker> this looks much nicer than I thought it would
[2:53:48] <bazz_tv> mahvel supers
[2:53:49] <Stichez> Izuna drop
[2:53:49] <TigerClaws12> there are combo trials in the training menu
[2:53:50] <UnfilteredComic> Izuna
[2:53:51] <Cobalt_ex> the hit effects are quite nice
[2:53:59] <DSD24> This game looks nice
[2:54:04] <%Buttface_> yeah they kind of do this for a living
[2:54:05] <Asuterisuku> Just the air grab.
[2:54:08] <Solidnick18> izuna
[2:54:08] <%Buttface_> have faith in them
[2:54:09] <ggbhtg> @camtsb is a dev btw yall
[2:54:19] <ggbhtg> his world is Lawwww
[2:54:20] <bazz_tv> bionic cow
[2:54:23] <CamTSB> lmao
[2:54:31] <b_ikki> clean move list
[2:54:34] <misc_mer> bionic hoof
[2:54:34] <ggbhtg> world, word, whatev
[2:54:37] <YiffyShonryu> Bionic Farm. Kappa
[2:54:38] <b_ikki> that's gotta be the cleanest move list i've seen
[2:54:43] <%Buttface_> it actually recently got buffed too
[2:54:47] <%yeknomlive> oh she got the air dash
[2:54:48] <%Buttface_> the movelist
[2:54:49] <ggbhtg> look at this SPREADSHEET
[2:54:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> the character tutrotials for this game are indepth per character and walk you threw the basic bnb for all characters and each individuals characterists
[2:54:57] <DSD24> Movelists are nice
[2:55:01] <JeoDood> i remember when max was fighting the game devs
[2:55:01] <ggbhtg> THIS ARCADE CABINET photo
[2:55:02] <KeystoneDefiant> The characters are animated really well. I'm really impressed.
[2:55:04] <Stichez> I love how you don't have to scroll down on the move list
[2:55:08] <GrinningOni> that's a pretty robust moves list
[2:55:09] <shevan123> hehehe
[2:55:11] <Liam_FGC> @CamTSB Yo that's a good move list screen, hats off to the UI person there
[2:55:17] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> you have to cancel level 1 to get level 2
[2:55:24] <BackwardCap> Level 2 is QCB during level 2
[2:55:24] <YiffyShonryu> ^
[2:55:29] <CamTSB> The second super is an addition to the first, it spends a second bar
[2:55:40] <%Buttface_> this is true for all characters
[2:55:44] <%Buttface_> not just tian
[2:55:45] <ChrisPlaysThing> it's durign the first one
[2:55:50] <CamTSB> There we go.
[2:55:51] <%yeknomlive> dark pheonix D:
[2:55:51] <NiktenKing> INSTALL
[2:55:53] <ggbhtg> we got power geyser extends?
[2:55:55] <Z3r0Paradox> literal pop off super
[2:55:56] <bazz_tv> all second supers are after the first ones right?
[2:55:57] <+R_BChe> is this dark pheonix monkaS
[2:55:57] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> it's a LITERAL DRAGON INSTALL
[2:55:58] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> dragon install, literally?
[2:56:00] <u_mostlyharmless> man you cancelled that quite early!
[2:56:02] <TigerClaws12> dragon has a dragon install 🤔
[2:56:03] <GrimHeaper323> DRAGON INSTALL lytMOTIVATED
[2:56:04] <NiktenKing> Literally DRAGON INSTALL
[2:56:05] <b_ikki> i cant control it
[2:56:10] <RadShiro> SHE CANT CONTROL IS PogChamp
[2:56:12] <bakazi> ride the fire
[2:56:12] <YiffyShonryu> MY BOI CANCELLED THAT EARLY
[2:56:15] <YiffyShonryu> IM SHOOK
[2:56:18] <CamTSB> Everything gets an install version of it @WoolieVersus
[2:56:19] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> it gives you a lot more air actions
[2:56:19] <Cobalt_ex> let it out
[2:56:20] <Stichez> Special moves
[2:56:22] <CamTSB> nice
[2:56:23] <ggbhtg> Dragon installs herSELF
[2:56:27] <u_mostlyharmless> changes a lot of your attacks, especially your specials
[2:56:28] <bazz_tv> BURNING
[2:56:28] <CamTSB> why do I even bother lol, he's got it
[2:56:34] <Arcanel> lmao Cam
[2:56:35] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> you can air dash like... 5 times
[2:56:38] <%Buttface_> yeah, right?
[2:56:40] <u_mostlyharmless> you fly longer, infinite dash cancels...
[2:56:42] <ggbhtg> @camtsb no kerp it up
[2:56:46] <+Grayhammatter> burnacle
[2:56:49] <ggbhtg> it helps
[2:56:58] <YiffyShonryu> You can air dash cancel your buttons a bit like Mahvel3 Magneto.
[2:56:59] <%Buttface_> I was about to explain all the changes and then realized that's so much more than they need
[2:57:06] <CamTSB> haha
[2:57:07] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> @CamTSB do you usually get clueless people who attempt to learn then give up so quick?
[2:57:08] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Reggie, Arizona is a Rekka character
[2:57:09] <%Buttface_> they're probably gonna try to rotate through the roster anyway
[2:57:14] <CamTSB> ye
[2:57:30] <bazz_tv> roster is small so is not hard to show them
[2:57:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:57:33] <+TheRealHamit> and they'll probably get a lot of it just by playing with it
[2:57:34] <ggbhtg> it's best to say it while they re in training
[2:57:40] <+Toa697> that pins hard
[2:57:41] <grovertoast> lol
[2:57:49] <ggbhtg> so they actually see it
[2:57:50] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> @WoolieVersus actually, it's Juggle Decay meter
[2:57:52] <u_mostlyharmless> yall played Pom yet? o:
[2:57:55] <TigerClaws12> that's juggle metter
[2:57:59] <u_mostlyharmless> bubble43Arieat
[2:58:01] <Asuterisuku> Velvet has the biggest magic reserves.
[2:58:02] <ggbhtg> they just started
[2:58:13] <%badbloodbear> badbloodbear subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! loved your for years dude happy to see you doing well
[2:58:15] <Arcanel> Velvet and Paprika, actually.
[2:58:18] <DensityD> you know what, that naruto stuff earlier was really fun
[2:58:24] <Arcanel> Even if Pap's are expendable.
[2:58:25] <YiffyShonryu> Arizona acquires magic stocks by landing lassos, Tianhuo’s recharges slowly by itself.
[2:58:28] <RadShiro> i remember playing a LITTLE bit of this early on, when Velvet was still mostly cardboard
[2:58:29] <+Toa697> wonder if you can lasso out of counter
[2:58:31] <DensityD> infinite paper works, and then we talked about Read or Die some
[2:58:32] <KeystoneDefiant> @CamTSB Did you build this in a pre-existing engine or something custom? This game looks to be playing remarkably smooth and tight.
[2:58:33] <DensityD> good times
[2:58:37] <ggbhtg> the bar next to their meter ISNT magic?
[2:58:40] <UnfilteredComic> Is it a rekka?
[2:58:44] <%Buttface_> this is the skullgirls engine
[2:58:47] <ristos237> I had a chance to play this game while i was at youmacon and its so sick, really glad to see it getting more attention
[2:58:47] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> @KeystoneDefiant LabZero engine
[2:58:50] <YiffyShonryu> @ggbhtg it is.
[2:58:51] <CamTSB> @UnfilteredComic ding ding ding, it's a rekka
[2:59:12] <YiffyShonryu> You can only rekka Light into the next strengths, I believe.
[2:59:24] <CamTSB> A to B, or A to C
[2:59:29] <KeystoneDefiant> Ahhh... that explains a lot. Thanks for that, @Buttface_ and @WishyWashyofSaddleArabia
[2:59:42] <Asuterisuku> The crescent bar is magic, they just have it set to infinite.
[2:59:50] <Byronic_dreamer> hello all, happy thanksgiving if you celebrate it.
[3:00:26] <Cobalt_ex> that’s a cool combo
[3:00:26] <bazz_tv> Woolie don't do Reggie's homework for him
[3:00:30] <%Buttface_> for not playing the tutorial, they've picked up a lot
[3:00:32] <NiktenKing> haven't done stomps yet
[3:00:33] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> man, I'm SO not used to seeing Launcher strings with Cow
[3:00:41] <YiffyShonryu> I recommend cancelling into Tina’s level 2 when your opponent floats in front of you.
[3:00:50] <YiffyShonryu> Level 2’s activation has a hit.
[3:00:56] <ggbhtg> they've gotten into a fighting game or 30 around here
[3:01:00] <Asuterisuku> Install gets longer flight, faster magic regeneration, improved specials... More airdashes, too.
[3:01:03] <ggbhtg> some things are universal
[3:01:06] <NiktenKing> Look at her supers
[3:01:07] <+TheRealHamit> How now ground cow
[3:01:09] <%Buttface_> I recommend not worrying about it since it's not like they know what it does and are just having fun
[3:01:09] <+Amaro57> Yeeeeeeeeeeeee
[3:01:14] <%Buttface_> apatDab
[3:01:15] <+Toa697> zero air ok
[3:01:28] <LilRamza> yoo this overlay looks clean :O
[3:01:43] <Arek_1> @WishyWashyofSaddleArabia Never seen Amaterasu in MvC3?
[3:01:44] <%yeknomlive> she doesnt get an install on his second?
[3:01:44] <Camail> has reggie gotten into the rope play yet
[3:01:45] <bazz_tv> She hulk follow up
[3:01:49] <ggbhtg> does she still say bionic farm?
[3:01:50] <u_mostlyharmless> you can magic dash after super, or do a dash and then 2D
[3:01:57] <CamTSB> We WILL have level 3's coming, but they aren't in yet @WoolieVersus
[3:01:59] <%yeknomlive> twilight turns into shadow labyrs
[3:02:00] <u_mostlyharmless> I mean level 3s are coming bubble43Arieat
[3:02:01] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Uh, I am
[3:02:05] <+TheRealHamit> SHould we tell them about taunts @CamTSB ?
[3:02:10] <DensityD> how many fonts is too many fonts? but you can also have too few fonts
[3:02:12] <u_mostlyharmless> Do let's tell them
[3:02:16] <CamTSB> In a bit, Hamit lol
[3:02:18] <ggbhtg> aint no complaints in the chat tho
[3:02:19] <dickbuttwoman> I haven't touched this game in too long
[3:02:20] <Byronic_dreamer> labbing is healthy
[3:02:21] <CamTSB> actually yeah nah
[3:02:25] <ShreddingPixels> The labs fun to watch
[3:02:26] <YiffyShonryu> Taunts aren’t in the game. Kappa
[3:02:29] <b_ikki> i really dig the ui in this
[3:02:30] <CamTSB> @WoolieVersus AY YO both of you start teabagging round start
[3:02:31] <%Buttface_> yes they are
[3:02:33] <misc_mer> no, bangerz font
[3:02:33] <%Buttface_> hang on
[3:02:37] <%Buttface_> don't you lie
[3:02:37] <oscarglez93> There are lvl 3, just yesterday happened the stream about them
[3:02:39] <%yeknomlive> dbz stage
[3:02:39] <misc_mer> all bangerz font
[3:02:42] <u_mostlyharmless> hey guys, listen to the music when you pick your characters!
[3:02:47] <+BigCoffee> Hope they will try the other characters, those 2 are kinda boring
[3:02:49] <Asuterisuku> Taunting is teabagging.
[3:02:51] <misc_mer> nothing else
[3:02:51] <%Buttface_> they already did harmless
[3:02:52] <grovertoast> @brynnsoz they did alraeady haha
[3:02:55] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Arizona gets magic when she gets ropes
[3:02:57] <bazz_tv> we should tell them they removed teabagging in this game and replaced it by dancing/headbanging depending of the character
[3:02:58] <YiffyShonryu> Oleander’s stage BGM /SLAPS/ the hardest.
[3:03:00] <%yeknomlive> interesting. twilight had to charge hers up manually
[3:03:01] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Tian gets magic when she's grounded
[3:03:01] <DensityD> steer eye for the cow guy
[3:03:02] <DSD24> Look at that cool guy in the back
[3:03:03] <+TheRealHamit> already in there
[3:03:06] <+TheRealHamit> just like that
[3:03:11] <+Zyquux> Magic is generated differently for each charater
[3:03:11] <Solidnick18> oooo
[3:03:12] <UnfilteredComic> Is magic character specific?
[3:03:13] <Solidus0101> CoolCat
[3:03:13] <dawnks> what
[3:03:14] <+Toa697> everyone has completely different magic mechanics
[3:03:18] <CamTSB> Yes @UnfilteredComic
[3:03:19] <+Zale_H> Magic is character specific
[3:03:20] <YiffyShonryu> The background characters change every now and then too.
[3:03:24] <%gatorafan> DrinkPurple CoolCat
[3:03:26] <DensityD> use the yomi
[3:03:28] <dawnks> so i guess this is super intuitive
[3:03:32] <@Menitta> I like background bull
[3:03:33] <%Buttface_> for example, the cow gets it for landing the lasso, the dragon gets it automatically
[3:03:39] <Camail> even the number of magic bars changes
[3:03:41] <+Zale_H> Oleander has to charge magic manually by reading or throwing
[3:03:43] <+OreoTheWolf> Woolie didn't see that he has an airdash.
[3:03:47] <+Zyquux> @UnfilteredComic yes. everyone has different amounts of magic and gets it different ways
[3:03:52] <Asuterisuku> It borrows a lot of mechanics from other airdashers, so people familiar with those can jump right in.
[3:03:59] <bazz_tv> Magick is the character dependant, is the gimmick button kinda like how passive stand users work in Heritage for the future
[3:04:02] <+RealPT1> lagbbing to learn buttons and feel is fine because learning is happening. combo grinding is hazardous.
[3:04:09] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus magic building is character specific, Arizona has to lasso
[3:04:18] <%Buttface_> we got blue beats
[3:04:21] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> Oh shit yea woolie you have an air dash @WoolieVersus
[3:04:39] <DensityD> welcome to the corner
[3:04:39] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:04:41] <YiffyShonryu> He tried to stuff the ash.
[3:04:42] <ggbhtg> daaang
[3:04:48] <YiffyShonryu> I’m hype PogChamp
[3:04:56] <Fep3> how can woolie choose the edgiest of characters even in a horse fighting game
[3:04:57] <Byronic_dreamer> that was brutal
[3:04:57] <fuji_92> wools here pressing buttons geez
[3:04:57] <ggbhtg> woolie was in the bunker
[3:04:57] <Stichez> Tian's version of the music
[3:04:59] <EspurWick> I thought they just started playing? all these combos 😂
[3:05:00] <%gatorafan> I love the music in this
[3:05:04] <SteinsApprentice> what is this and why am I hearing real fighting sounds from it
[3:05:05] <%yeknomlive> pressing buttons in this game is very satisfying
[3:05:15] <YiffyShonryu> WAIT MY BOI HASNT STOMPED YET
[3:05:19] <YiffyShonryu> 💦💦💦
[3:05:21] <TigerClaws12> throw combos bois
[3:05:24] <CamTSB> He stomped, just not in the match
[3:05:24] <DensityD> losing is fun
[3:05:27] <TigerClaws12> we anime
[3:05:27] <Asuterisuku> @Fep3 Tian is far from the edgiest character. You just haven't seen Oleander yet.
[3:05:28] <+Zyquux> Reminder that Tianhuo's specials are Ash, Bash, and Crash and are used with the A, B, and C buttons.
[3:05:30] <CamTSB> just let him do his thing
[3:05:31] <YiffyShonryu> OhMyDog PowerUpR
[3:05:35] <grovertoast> lol
[3:05:37] <%Buttface_> damn
[3:05:42] <Liam_FGC> If you choose random it actually changes between rounds
[3:05:44] <ggbhtg> to be fair, even Fighting is Magic was like this in beta
[3:05:46] <Z3r0Paradox> "I hate your guts tian" is the right way to feel about tian- I mean, respect ya dragons
[3:05:46] <@CrankyVT> Should probably @ them about the magic differences if they haven't seen it already
[3:05:47] <%Buttface_> Reggie already sounding like he's been playing for years
[3:05:49] <Finchit> Gimmie a new beat
[3:05:51] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus magic building is character specific
[3:06:02] <%Buttface_> Ole stage jiyuDaigasm
[3:06:04] <+KetsuoTaberu> lmao
[3:06:06] <YiffyShonryu> Best stage b
[3:06:09] <Arcanel> Screw you Zero D: Don't bully the longma.

[3:26:29] <MarshMan301> what if the stars are just a looping bg
[3:26:32] <@Menitta> It looks like a loop
[3:26:32] <ggbhtg> parallax bois
[3:26:36] <ChrisPlaysThing> exponential
[3:26:38] <TechDragon_Z> I wanna see what happens when she drops
[3:26:38] <BleedinActionMan> Exponential
[3:26:48] <CamTSB> haha
[3:26:51] <grovertoast> math time
[3:26:51] <+jiggy_snipe> i hope she turns into a fireball when she falls
[3:26:51] <Stichez> Or will it
[3:26:52] <kikosmore> When you drop well know if your actually going any higher .
[3:26:53] <Camail> feels more logarithmic

[3:27:01] <CamTSB> Let her go and wait
[3:27:01] <SheefEatsBeef> what if the background is just a gif?
[3:27:02] <ChrisPlaysThing> OR the background is moving regardless of elevation after a point
[3:27:02] <+Toa697> can devin clear things up
[3:27:06] <@CrankyVT> It could also be a star bg layer that's parallaxing below a gradient to make it seem endless

[3:39:09] <%Buttface_> @Cuddler220 there is one character confirmed for after full release
[3:39:12] <CamTSB> @WoolieVersus bottom left
[3:39:13] <YiffyShonryu> Yo I’m weak

[3:39:16] <Finaldragoon> @Cuddler220 after the 1.0 release
[3:39:16] <%Buttface_> potentially more
[3:39:17] <CamTSB> @WoolieVersus you can't make a pixel lobby
[3:39:17] <%yeknomlive> i hope they add in trixie
[3:39:22] <Stichez> No you can't
[3:39:24] <ggbhtg> Wat do mods?
[3:39:26] <grovertoast> you can't make a lobby
[3:39:29] <40_bass> no salt mines in lobby.
[3:39:30] <Naughta_Noob> @cuddler220 They still need to finish a story mode, first but yes
[3:39:31] <ggbhtg> er devs
[3:39:38] <%Wool> GO TOA DIFFERENT ONE
[3:39:40] <N1netbattler> rip
[3:39:42] <Stichez> You have to port forward to make lobbies
[3:39:46] <%gatorafan> making a lobby requires some setup
[3:39:49] <+Toa697> what about me a different one?
[3:39:49] <DensityD> how I mine for salt?
[3:39:50] <EspurWick> ok cool 👍
[3:39:55] <+Nappyrat> You can make a pixel lobby, but it's a separate program, needs a bit of set up
[3:39:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:39:55] <BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus go to fluffly lab 2
[3:39:57] <%Wool> I'm pretty sure Mane 2 is down

[3:40:13] <Stichez> Different maps btw
[3:40:13] <+Nappyrat> not something to do during a stream if y'don't already know etc.
[3:40:14] <%Buttface_> @DensityD there are salt mines hidden in the lobbies where you can mine salt
[3:40:16] <CamTSB> @WoolieVersus jump down the hole in the middle, just hold down
[3:40:20] <TigerClaws12> just crash all the server sfuck it LUL

[3:50:02] <CamTSB> yeah uh
[3:50:03] <medril07> bar red, get dead
[3:50:04] <CamTSB> we're all kinda here
[3:50:06] <FpsRaptor> how's the netcode ??

[3:50:12] <ggbhtg> DAMN NAPPY too?!
[3:50:12] <CamTSB> @FpsRaptor GGPO
[3:50:19] <ggbhtg> ALL the warriors
[3:50:21] <zenith0111> Oh it's that Oreo LUL
[3:50:22] <@Solidus_113> Only one DLC character coming, but it's not any time soon
[3:50:22] <EspurWick> Devs are in the chat? 👀
[3:50:23] <@Solidus_113> Goat
[3:50:28] <FpsRaptor> I see Kreygasm
[3:50:30] <%Buttface_> lasso can be used for combos as well
[3:50:31] <ltowns> A lot of the bg characters are backer submitted from crowdfund @WoolieVersus
[3:50:31] <Sir_Blitz> Honestly really interesting to see how much of these movesets survived from that alpha forever ago
[3:50:34] <DensityD> nothing after lasso
[3:50:36] <Camail> what lobby are they in
[3:50:37] <%Buttface_> 5D is a combo tool
[3:50:41] <Z3r0Paradox> low lasso is a hard knockdown
[3:50:41] <Ultimatefool> Why does this look like a knockoff My little pony?
[3:50:43] <%Wool> is that how Canadians pronounce lasso???
[3:50:44] <+queaks> lasso gives magic
[3:50:46] <+Nappyrat> A lot of the current background characters were designed by our backers
[3:50:48] <@Solidus_113> Because it is @Ultimatefool
[3:50:50] <Magick_Man> @Ultimatefool It is.
[3:50:52] <40_bass> 5D and 4D can be combed after, 2D is a hard knockdown for oki @WoolieVersus
[3:50:54] <CamTSB> @WoolieVersus normal rope causes stagger, high rope groundbounces. Both can be followed up.
[3:50:55] <BleedinActionMan> @Ultimatefool Because it was, at one point
[3:50:56] <%Buttface_> @Ultimatefool look up the documentary on the game on youtube
[3:50:57] <Potatoidea> @Ultimatefool It was originally a MLP game
[3:51:00] <+jim_heine> @Ultimatefool precisely because it started as a fanmade MLP fighter
[3:51:00] <EspurWick> Well this game looks awesome 👍
[3:51:09] <medril07> sure thing twilight
[3:51:10] <majindusto> Arizona WAS Applejack
[3:51:13] <prime_name> Is Arizona voiced by Tara Strong?
[3:51:14] <Sir_Blitz> @Ultimatefool It's what it was originally, Hasbro pulled the plug, Lauren Faust heard about it, gave them new designs
[3:51:18] <grovertoast> @prime_name yes
[3:51:32] <dickbuttwoman> AH almost the continue
[3:51:38] <medril07> THERE ARE SUPERS!?
[3:51:42] <+supahrob64> Hey Mane6, was there a direct inspiration for the dynamic music system?
[3:51:49] <grovertoast> music change
[3:51:52] <+supahrob64> Or was it a this'll be hella cool
[3:51:54] <CamTSB> @prime_name yes.
[3:52:02] <CamTSB> I think it was mostly a "This'll be hella cool" thing
[3:52:06] <medril07> damage portait
[3:52:09] <TigerClaws12> Loops
[3:52:11] <%Buttface_> and it turns out it was hella cool
[3:52:15] <+Anukan> @supahrob64 some inspiration, but we wanted to push it harder.
[3:52:17] <$Kekon3> I was so worried about the comeback @pika
[3:52:17] <CamTSB> it was in fact hella cool
[3:52:18] <%Buttface_> final round pap stage jiyuDaigasm
[3:52:23] <+Nappyrat> @supahrob64 we wanted to do it even in the previous project, stuff like Diddy Kong Racing's char select screen were heavy inspiration
[3:52:24] <+supahrob64> Cuz ya, it's was mega hella cool
[3:52:26] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus @camtsb is a dev @nappyrat a dev... there are more, all the warriors are here

[4:15:28] <%Buttface_> MADMAN
[4:15:31] <grovertoast> aw nice tho
[4:15:33] <Camail> he whiffed the command htrow!
[4:15:38] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[4:15:38] <%shiokenstar> what happens when that bar below the healthbar fills up?
[4:15:41] <+Jaysky> Pap seems like a pink horse
[4:15:44] <+5_FiveByFive_5> that AA tho
[4:15:51] <+Toa697> this paprika isnt even doing the wack stuff
[4:15:55] <DedlokPM> @shiokenstar that is the juggle decay bar
[4:15:56] <NiktenKing> It's juggle decay meter
[4:15:57] <+OreoTheWolf> @shiokenstar They get heavier until they can't be juggled anymore
[4:16:01] <%shiokenstar> ah
[4:16:02] <%shiokenstar> tyty
[4:16:03] <CamTSB> @shiokenstar gravity starts working harder on them, keeps them from being juggled more and more
[4:16:05] <Sir_Blitz> Pap absolutely started as a certain pink horse, yes
[4:16:06] <%Buttface_> @shiokenstar gravity starts increasing on each hit of the combo, the character getting hit gets much more meter for being hit, and hard knockdowns stop working except for supers
[4:16:07] <YiffyShonryu> @shiokenstar Gravity increases, making you harder to combo.
[4:16:10] <40_bass> @shiokenstar Juggle decay once it fills theres more and more gravity until they hit the ground
[4:16:11] <u_mostlyharmless> @shiokenstar your opponent gets heavier with the next hits when it gets full
[4:16:11] <P0wderedT0astMan> whats the lore with Paprika?
[4:16:12] <TigerClaws12> upforward D first iirc
[4:16:15] <@Solidus_113> Pap is like 95% Pinkie
[4:16:18] <%Buttface_> pap's lore is
[4:16:22] <%Buttface_> chaotic smoochtral
[4:16:22] <u_mostlyharmless> lmao we all jumped in
[4:16:27] <b_ikki> where the items at FeelsBadMan
[4:16:29] <%gatorafan> she crazy. End lore
[4:16:30] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> I hoep DFI shows uss some picnic basket
[4:16:31] <+Jaysky> Are the old themes still in the game? Or are they lost to time and space?
[4:16:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> saw a bit of that classic fourth wall breakage in Pap, so yeah, totally Ponkers.
[4:16:33] <EyeFarted> Is that llama getting naked mid-combo?
[4:16:33] <%Buttface_> she wants to give love even if it puts you in mortal peril
[4:16:34] <+PMAvers> Paprika is going to kill us all.
[4:16:37] <+5_FiveByFive_5> how have I never heard "chaotic smoochtral" before
[4:16:37] <ltowns> Pap's affection is too powerful for the mortal plane
[4:16:42] <SubrosianDimitri> @p0wderedt0astman think Carl from Llamas with Hats, but less intentionally murderous
[4:16:48] <%Buttface_> also there are lore snippets on the official website for each character
[4:16:57] <P0wderedT0astMan> oh wow.
[4:16:59] <stranger59> That was a good one.
[4:17:01] <groovykrovvy> got some good hits in, tho

[4:24:51] <+tymetak> I live in the mines FeelsBadMan
[4:24:52] <%gatorafan> BlessRNG
[4:24:53] <YiffyShonryu> The best part about leveling up the Salt Mines is how hard the music starts to SLAP.
[4:24:55] <ergheisu> but much better
[4:24:58] <ggbhtg> Is Wash a dev?
[4:25:02] <grovertoast> @zenith0111 clothes

[4:25:22] <TimMcGraw> ALRIGHT GAMERS LETS GET THIS SALT
[4:25:27] <ergheisu> destroyed
[4:25:35] <zenith0111> @grovertoast Oh so it's Tekken Treasure Battle but online for some reason
[4:25:46] <Finaldragoon> phase 4
[4:25:51] <mauvecow> something happens when time runs out, something magical
[4:25:52] <+5_FiveByFive_5> there's so many people the salt is going quick lol
[4:25:55] <chthilic> When you kill all the predators all the salt respawns
[4:25:57] <Z3r0Paradox> Salt respawns every round
[4:25:59] <CamTSB> @WoolieVersus salt respawns each wave, once all the predators have been killed
[4:25:59] <invertigo_> the salt respawned, but you gotta get it quick
[4:26:08] <misc_mer> Fight for the Salt
[4:26:17] <misc_mer> Heritage for the Salt
[4:26:19] <invertigo_> race for the salt

[4:26:28] <Z3r0Paradox> Them's Fightin' Herds
[4:26:35] <40_bass> @UrielCobalt Thems Fightin' Herds
[4:26:36] <mauvecow> i have never seen the mines emptied this fast
[4:26:36] <+OkamiDude15> this is them's fightin' herds
[4:26:37] <deafmelone> man this way cooler than the krypt
[4:26:39] <+Toa697> can you challenge players for salt?
[4:26:40] <%Buttface_> right
[4:26:46] <Sir_Blitz> I really like this, it's like a big public event with really smooth fight transitions
[4:26:48] <%Buttface_> full salt mine runs don't happen
[4:26:50] <+Anukan> I might need to buff salt a bit...
[4:26:51] <Z3r0Paradox> You can challenge players for chest, you can throw dynamite at players to stun them
[4:26:56] <+Anukan> for full server runs
[4:26:58] <Finaldragoon> phase 5
[4:27:01] <+TheRealHamit> @Toa697 not directly, but there are hat chests that you can fight over
[4:27:04] <TimMcGraw> @Toa697 salt chests will occasionally spawn in the main lobby, but you cant challenge them for salt in the mines
[4:27:13] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[4:27:15] <u_mostlyharmless> LMAO DALONE
[4:27:19] <+UrielCobalt> @Z3r0Paradox @40_bass thanks

[4:27:51] <YiffyShonryu> Dałone’s my punching bag.
[4:27:52] <CamTSB> So as the levels increase, the difficulty of the CPU does as well.
[4:27:54] <zenith0111> Why does chat know everyone? LUL
[4:28:01] <%Buttface_> because there's a community discord
[4:28:03] <CamTSB> And the health on the Predators increases.
[4:28:04] <%Buttface_> and most of us are in it
[4:28:06] <Z3r0Paradox> TFH players are in here
[4:28:09] <Stichez> No, they're unique
[4:28:10] <ggbhtg> we call that
[4:28:14] <Z3r0Paradox> everyone my dad
[4:28:14] <YiffyShonryu> Because TFH community cares. TPFufun

[4:28:31] <+JMDurden> TFH, the cousins of SG
[4:28:34] <%Buttface_> also that
[4:28:35] <40_bass> you can dynamite people at the end of a fight, but you need to time it really well
[4:28:39] <+5_FiveByFive_5> SG is like big sis
[4:28:40] <%Buttface_> Cam posted the stream in the discord
[4:28:40] <+Toa697> thanks voice dude
