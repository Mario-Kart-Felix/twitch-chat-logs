[0:01:32] <%gatorafan> Woolñie released HALO PogChamp
[0:01:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Melchior_the_Wise
[0:01:41] <%krispen_wa> Woolie is finally playing something on release date?!
[0:01:42] <+Aeoneth> Now is at least the 2nd best time to start
[0:01:43] <+maenos2> took me a moment to realize that's the hokage hat on the wall. was wondering why Woolie just had a giant D on his wall
[0:01:44] <Halospaz117> Remember everyone, the proper way to listen to the ODST OST is with rain soundeffects in the background
[0:01:45] <%RyTYoung> I played this through alooooot
[0:01:49] <%Thraximunday> Thraximunday converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[0:01:51] <TheChucklingOak> Oh hey, the kirby light reminded me about that Kirby fighting game that got announced. How the heck is that gonna play even?
[0:01:53] <Melchior_the_Wise> you ready to jump into hell?
[0:01:54] <%ZeroCruz> All of them are now on PC yup nothing else is coming
[0:01:54] <%RyTYoung> Firefight is a sick horde mode
[0:01:55] <+DesertPenguin> @WoolieVErsus I don't think Halo 5 will be on the collection before you finish ODST so you may have to wait for the next one. Seems you caught up.
[0:01:57] <%Solidnick18> i rented and beat it but it is pretty short
[0:01:57] <tearfuldevil> i look forward to ignoring this stream for like an hour while V yells at chat befoe the game starts
[0:02:00] <+wunp_fxs> Jazzz time
[0:02:02] <+TheShisno> Hell yeah
[0:02:10] <xXButtonMasher69Xx> Hi Woolie and V! Just stopping by. ODST and 5 are the only Halo games I haven't played so I wanna get around to them with my brother before I vibe with you guys. Probably gonna watch the anime for this one. Have a good stream!
[0:02:10] <+Walopoh> oh no
[0:02:10] <%Deadpal> sweet jazz and hellajeff
[0:02:12] <derap41> Yah like Jazz? I
[0:02:12] <+yhom_tork> are we getting the terminals?
[0:02:12] <+DukeAtomic> @DesertPenguin Halo 5 isn't part of the collection
[0:02:13] <%Solid_Stro> Played this back in middle school, shit man
[0:02:14] <%Solidnick18> that sucks
[0:02:17] <+DesertPenguin> oh
[0:02:17] <DeadLemmy666> so no logs then. thats cool
[0:02:18] <+DukeAtomic> It only goes up to Halo 4
[0:02:20] <derrame_> !uptime
[0:02:20] <Sullry> ODST is such a nice compact experience
[0:02:21] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 13 minutes and 43 seconds
[0:02:23] <councilmechanica> ODST is enjoyable because it's the one game in the series to dabble in getting very close to feeling more like a 'tactical' shooter than the other titles
[0:02:25] <Halospaz117> Fucking Jackal Snipers got V's Car this time
[0:02:28] <correctedsun117> Are you ready for a sucking open-world, jazzy noir mystery game?
[0:02:28] <The_Swedish_X> This is the only Halo fps I've never touched before this rerelease.
[0:02:31] <+DesertPenguin> What about Halo 6?
[0:02:32] <%CptnCampy61> Never played ODST, pretty excited to see this
[0:02:34] <+TheShisno> Woolie and The Guy Who Is Wrong But Also Loud So Who Knows Mk. II
[0:02:36] <+DesertPenguin> After this is 5 and then what?
[0:02:37] <chernyk0> are we all doing acid now?
[0:02:41] <+KPlanet__Live> battery cheese
[0:02:42] <$usotaku013666> Probably the best Side story in the franchise
[0:02:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, if the Cole Protocol is bad and we're over the Spartan Program meme, what's gonna be the new Halo joke?
[0:02:43] <DisasterJensen> damn v, that was me last week
[0:02:44] <ghostravens> so little v found cthulhu under his hood?
[0:02:45] <derap41> There are car nerds
[0:02:49] <%liphttam1> liphttam1 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:02:51] <TheChucklingOak> Chat, let's not be shits today, okay?
[0:02:52] <+DesertPenguin> Yea
[0:02:54] <+vaporousTippler> I mean, cars are basically just PCs that move.
[0:02:55] <arkv01> car grease monkey
[0:02:56] <+jiggy_snipe> you can be a nerd for anything
[0:02:57] <+DesertPenguin> We're called Jalopies
[0:03:01] <%liphttam1> :O
[0:03:04] <The_Swedish_X> @TheChucklingOak that's asking a lot
[0:03:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Car Connoiseur
[0:03:05] <chainsaw105> car guy is the male equivalent of a horse girl
[0:03:07] <%Javaa01> Car nerds are a very real thing
[0:03:08] <MayorRev> sloppy jalopy
[0:03:11] <Melchior_the_Wise> @TheChucklingOak is that a real request?
[0:03:11] <DisasterJensen> I'm getting the battery now
[0:03:12] <+KPlanet__Live> the battery on the new escapes takes me an hour to change
[0:03:12] <+DesertPenguin> Ford's are annoying like that
[0:03:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> lol
[0:03:13] <xxshadowxx416> the forrurrer sage
[0:03:15] <%Solid_Stro> Spent a lot of time getting all the achievements for this game back in the day
[0:03:18] <InvisibleMan101> car nerds exist and they are as weird as you expect
[0:03:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:03:19] <+condemned_15> @WoolieVersus **FOR V ONLY** You guys gonna do a terminal run or will the semi pacifist requirement just bog down the LP?
[0:03:20] <raikagelord1> Gear head? Right?
[0:03:21] <%liphttam1> I'm sad that MCC took out my favorite achievement for this game.
[0:03:21] <+chefgearhead> It’s called a Gearhead
[0:03:27] <derap41> Ford cars are generally not made with mantinace conform in mind
[0:03:28] <+DesertPenguin> Do you need a new battery tho?
[0:03:34] <%Solid_Stro> @liphttam1 Which ones?
[0:03:42] <%Setsuna_seiei> could be a buick where the battery is under the passenger seat and you have to dismantle the front bumper yo qccess the headlights
[0:03:42] <+Vijuani> Gearsofwarhead
[0:03:43] <InvisibleMan101> @DesertPenguin it exploded
[0:03:46] <privatecorgi> Understandable
[0:03:46] <derap41> Electrons moves slower in cold
[0:03:49] <+DesertPenguin> That's a bad
[0:03:51] <akman14> Temp difference ruin batteries
[0:03:52] <TheChucklingOak> The struggles of living up north.
[0:03:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> shit sucks
[0:03:57] <+DesertPenguin> Woolie, cold makes everything slow down
[0:04:11] <+DesertPenguin> It's science
[0:04:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> -40C is also -40F
[0:04:20] <+Joestar_SSB> Yo V, you enjoy Bury The Light?
[0:04:21] <+Aeoneth> Fun fact: Cars can also lose charge if they sit around for too long. Source: Me having to boost my battery every month because of how little driving I do these days

[0:05:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Choo Chooo HypeFirst
[0:05:26] <%Javaa01> Was that -40 accounting for windchill or raw -40`?
[0:05:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> the incredibles meme
[0:05:27] <%Mr_Strut> Triple digits sucks but low 100 is doable
[0:05:29] <TheChucklingOak> Fahrenheit is top-tier,

[0:10:28] <+jiggy_snipe> dense is good
[0:10:33] <ghostravens> i love yakuza 0. can't wait to beat it one day
[0:10:34] <%liphttam1> Today I learned ODST's world is mirrored
[0:10:35] <CappuccinoGuil> It's also really easy to do shit, they put sidequests ON THE MAP
[0:10:36] <nobleclonetrooper> Yakuza is fucking incredible.
[0:10:36] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a deep ass lake
[0:10:36] <%Solidnick18> it's just a dense area
[0:10:36] <%kyh9> Has Woolie never played a Yakuza game?
[0:10:37] <Halospaz117> You got like 5 things to do on a single street
[0:10:39] <$kirin_fellwinter> Cheer500 Hey Woolie, hope your enthusiastic about what's in store with ODST. Fun fact about the game: ODST was given only one year of development. Your entire squad is also voiced by the cast of Firefly.
[0:10:40] <TheChucklingOak> Dense is always better than giant. Look at MGS5 for an example of why giant isn't always a great idea
[0:10:40] <%RyTYoung> LUL PogChamp LUL PogChamp
[0:10:41] <Halospaz117> It's great
[0:10:41] <%McSoliace> yakuza has variety
[0:10:41] <Winner_92> yakuza open world is a great size, so many games ruin their open worlds for being too big
[0:10:45] <+condemned_15> Kiwami 2 and Y6 is even more dense
[0:11:01] <+JustToWatch> So if Woolie were to do a weekly Yakuza 0 Stream with V it would take half a year...
[0:11:04] <%TheStarSquid> TheStarSquid subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:11:10] <f0rgeman> YEAH BOIS ODST
[0:11:11] <+TheShisno> Yakuza is good Shenmue
[0:11:12] <@akuda_bar> it's dense and you're never like "i've been doing the same thing for ages" because you'll usually be interrupted with some original shit
[0:11:15] <CappuccinoGuil> It's great for LPing
[0:11:20] <PentagramJ2> Hope yall do some FireFight at some point
[0:11:26] <%Solidnick18> i think yakuza 5 is the longest
[0:11:30] <exnuart> shenmue except its good
[0:11:38] <chainsaw105> just use the slime gun 4head
[0:11:38] <%EdenOfLove> wait did you do Mr. Shakedown?

[0:11:40] <%AMUSERNAME> yeah, about 90hrs for me too
[0:11:40] <%Javaa01> Doing 100% completionism is not worth it in Yakuza games

What better oppotunity to use the last of these bits I have? I hope you both have a blast! Side Note: If ya'll get a good kick out of the "Terminals" in this one, you might wanna pop some optics over towards "I Love Bee", as the Terminals are a reference to the A(lternative) Reality Game used as part of Halo 2's marketting Campaign.

[0:13:59] <+wunp_fxs> LUL
[0:13:59] <+Dova573> it was bad screamo shit
[0:14:00] <%BisoromiBear> just listen to every other combat theme
[0:14:01] <+VCRUZZO> Yeah the difference
[0:14:03] <+jiggy_snipe> it's fine, there are better songs
[0:14:03] <+classical_gomez> I hope they do the terminals in this
[0:14:03] <+DesertPenguin> LUL
[0:14:06] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> subhuman isn't trash (at least the remake), it's just a mediocre song in a game full of bangers
[0:14:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:14:07] <+DesertPenguin> I hate that feeling
[0:14:13] <%hattrick61> also the writer was a pedo
[0:14:17] <%Reaver_Parable> time to watch odst live action trailer
[0:14:18] <TheChucklingOak> Subhuman is good in GAMEPLAY, with the "you cannot kill me", but as a song on its OWN it just doesn't measure up to the others. I do still like the newer version at least.
[0:14:19] <Gamertilltime> sub human i did not like at first but grew on me
[0:14:23] <+VCRUZZO> Between them is crazy
[0:14:23] <DSD24> Put it back in it ain't done yet
[0:14:26] <+AkronymCLT> I actually quite like the instrumentals but the vocals are too much for me
[0:14:32] <+Joestar_SSB> I like Little V's version of Sunhuman tbf
[0:14:35] <armchairmaster_> Tom Cruise scream is the best. hhhwwwwaaaaaaaaah
[0:14:37] <+Walopoh> and also the pedo shit
[0:14:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Also, the vocalist coerced a minor to send him nudes, soooooo
[0:14:41] <styx_highway> So how many times has Kirby there fallen down?
[0:14:48] <+AkronymCLT> Bury the light blows that shit outta the water tho
[0:14:48] <exnuart> subhuman is only good in game at S rank
[0:14:49] <%libra_zero> then they had to redo the song due to unrelated problems with the band
[0:14:51] <+Joestar_SSB> I'm not just sayin' that. That version sounds actually done
[0:14:51] <armchairmaster_> @walopoh n a n i ?
[0:15:07] <thelivingglitch307> Bury the Bias

[0:15:18] <+Walopoh> @armchairmaster_ writer of the song is s fucked up person
[0:15:20] <Depthcharge2030> the first time i listened to subhuman was actually v's cover
[0:15:28] <%ZeroCruz> TASTE THE BLOOD
[0:15:31] <TheChucklingOak> As much as I love Devil Trigger, I'd also say that Crimson Cloud is the best "battle" theme for in-game. The best overall song is definitely Devil Trigger or Bury the Light tho
[0:15:32] <%Mr_Strut> Make EVERYONE feel bad
[0:15:32] <DSD24> Violent Subhuman
[0:15:35] <+kd2jag> YEAHHHHH BEST SOUNDTRACK BEST CAST FITE ME

[0:18:02] <%alpacasintophats> so in short: bury the light is the best DMC 5 track then?

[0:23:12] <+yhom_tork> theyre easy to find
[0:23:12] <+Walopoh> apparently they are easy to find
[0:23:14] <splitmilkttv> You'll probably stumble on most of them
[0:23:16] <Halospaz117> As long as you know what to look for
[0:23:16] <%a_goth_pancake> but they tell an awesome side story.
[0:23:17] <%Javaa01> The game points you in the direction of the collectables
[0:23:17] <marvel877> Its a sidestory really.
[0:23:18] <DeltaD36> @WoolieVersus Did you watch the live action trailer of ODST? It's good.

[0:24:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PAIGE IS THAT YOU?
[0:24:41] <DotDusk> Foolishness V, foolishness.
[0:24:49] <%AMUSERNAME> Yo, the REAL ESTATE sidequest too WAY more time than Cabaret, tbh
[0:24:49] <%PKSomething> Dark Slayer from DMC4
[0:24:53] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> imagine locking SDT behind a 15 hour mini game
[0:24:55] <%slimmixrp> Lock DT
[0:24:56] <roz_en> sadly, I think were just getting started
[0:24:57] <%doomerskeletor13> Cabaret is easy to grind out imo
[0:25:00] <%SilverDevilfish> "Hey bro, want another fucking headband." - Ghost of Sushi Mom
[0:25:02] <+enternius> Wakka's final weapon
[0:25:02] <chainsaw105> incorrect, Breaker FUCKS
[0:25:03] <%PKSomething> Lock Sin DT behind it
[0:25:05] <%McSoliace> you could do most of that offsacreen tbf
[0:25:06] <+classical_gomez> when I played on Xbox, the audio logs saved on further playthroughs, which is a nice change from the original
[0:25:06] <%krispen_wa> cabaret is fun tho
[0:25:09] <mehfromBL> just saw his twitter, did they start yet or is it over?
[0:25:13] <%D00msDayDan> remember when anthem put a grind wall a couple of hours into the story when the game had a free trial? no, i'm the only one in here that played anthem? that's fine
[0:25:17] <SomersaultJustice> set your properties, go play mahjong, collect money later
[0:25:17] <%HollowedIdjit> Cabaret isn't that bad tho
[0:25:22] <%ZeroCruz> MAD DOG
[0:25:23] <TheChucklingOak> Anthem was real?
[0:25:24] <VidulaSaix> Persona is a great example actually. You CAN get amazing Personas but you dont need them to finish the game
[0:25:25] <$usotaku013666> @mehfrombl just started
[0:25:25] <+classical_gomez> haven't started yet
[0:25:27] <thebalticguy1> This is like not getting one of Dantes styles
[0:25:29] <armchairmaster_> Imagine locking GHOST FORM behind a 10 hour fishing side story
[0:25:35] <Jazz_Handler> Hey woolie hope you and V enjoy the game together! I’m watching from my Christian College rn since it’s Halo of course!
[0:25:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Cabaret Club is hella fun, though
[0:25:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Cabaret story is fun at least
[0:25:43] <+einherjarvalk> also V is wrong because Cabaret is great
[0:25:49] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Cabaret sideplot is the worst part of the game
[0:25:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> i would appreciate a fighting game that limited you in the story until you unlocked additional moves, where you be super styling at the end.
[0:26:01] <Joestar1890> Caberet music do be banging tho
[0:26:02] <mehfromBL> woohoo, first time getting on a stream before it starts
[0:26:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Cabaret Club was my favorite part, but it doesn't hit quite the same in Kiwami 2
[0:26:03] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Nice
[0:26:07] <DeltaD36> NAthan Fillion is based.
[0:26:07] <%ozzrabbit> Basically beating Blitzball to get Waka’s Ultimate weapon
[0:26:11] <coreyyotto> isn't there a character modelled after Nathan Fillion?
[0:26:15] <Greedboyz> ODST is such a gem, a GEM of a game
[0:26:16] <Halospaz117> The exception to that is Romeo, Romeo is voiced by Nolan North
[0:26:21] <%AMUSERNAME> Cabaret Club was fantastic, if a bit tedious. REAL ESTATE THOUGH LUL
[0:26:24] <%a_goth_pancake> Nathan Fillion is best UNSC uwu
[0:26:27] <DeltaD36> @coreyyotto Edward Buck
[0:26:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Bungie really likes Firefly
[0:26:32] <JayPastaForce> Waka's Final weapon
[0:26:39] <TheChucklingOak> Also, It TOTALLY RAINED in ODST. I don't care what anyone says. If it sounds like, looks like, and feels like rain, its totally rain.
[0:26:40] <%a_goth_pancake> Sgt Eddie Reynolds.
[0:26:41] <$JamesCorck> Cheer500 Hey Woolie and V, so happy you guys are doing ODST, holyshit this is great. This game has what, at least for me, is the best story in the Halo Universe (and it's hidden in an optional collectible sidequest). I think V knows which I'm talking about (whistles).
[0:26:42] <Joestar1890> Good ol' Nathan Fillion-Alan Tudyk dream combo
[0:26:45] <%threeheadedwalrus> COLE PROTOCOL
[0:26:46] <prime_name> Halo had an AR game?

[0:26:55] <%D00msDayDan> high impact saxual violence
[0:26:56] <+jiggy_snipe> that's big false LUL
[0:26:58] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @thechucklingoak what the fuck is it if not rain???
[0:27:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> wait, Microsoft buying Sega?
[0:27:01] <%kyh9> FORCE THEM TO RELEASE SMT
[0:27:01] <mehfromBL> Are they doing the Mombasa street segments or just the missions?

[0:27:16] <alrobot2014> @kyh9 don't give me that hope
[0:27:19] <Joestar1890> @TheChucklingOak AFAIK, It rains in the first level
[0:27:24] <+Grayhammatter> ODST Kreygasm
[0:27:25] <Halospaz117> @armchairmaster_ I personally feel Wolan West is underrated
[0:27:50] <f0rgeman> The engine couldn't handle actual rain so they faked it with sfx and textures
[0:28:01] <%doomerskeletor13> hands shoulders knees and toes
[0:28:06] <SereneFox> Man, that Rocksmith stream was amazing.
[0:28:09] <hot_take_jake> Jack White?
[0:28:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> you can push yourself, but it'll feel terrible and won't allow you to go to full potential
[0:28:17] <TheLeadingTone> I think Ed Sheeran plays a smaller scale guitar
[0:28:25] <kenny_biff> Paul Gilbert!
[0:28:25] <armchairmaster_> Stretch and do the Macarena in order to get gains.
[0:28:29] <critfumble_> flight of the conchords playibng that tiny piano gets me every time

[0:28:50] <TheChucklingOak> That's what they did for the Gurren Lagann soundtrack. Trust me.
[0:28:50] <+Grayhammatter> like a Thurman
[0:28:51] <Clear_Truth> Tom Morrello on that weird stuff
[0:29:04] <marvel877> Theremin?
[0:29:06] <hot_take_jake> Watch It Might Get Loud for Jack White just being like "yeah I play shitty plastic guitars also lemme just hammer a pick up to a plank w/ a wire
[0:29:13] <@akuda_bar> double neck tho
[0:29:13] <+Grayhammatter> theremin, yes
[0:29:34] <%a_goth_pancake> normalize theremins in modern music.
[0:29:46] <marvel877> got a stew going
[0:29:51] <@akuda_bar> that guy is crazy
[0:29:52] <+DesertPenguin> What about the neckboards that have angled frets?
[0:29:52] <armchairmaster_> The more strings you add, the more Insight you get into the Old Ways.
[0:29:53] <+That1blindkid> I still cant believe V never got his drums back
[0:29:54] <TheChucklingOak> I have a wierd appreciation for snare drums now, after I heard that one track from Half life Opposing Force
[0:29:55] <akman14> At what point does adding strings to a guitar just turns it to a harp?
[0:29:56] <Halospaz117> I love that video
[0:30:11] <critfumble_> the problem with the theremin is you always look like an asshole playing the theremin
[0:30:13] <+DesertPenguin> Fuck yea that guy
[0:30:14] <Melchior_the_Wise> or using a Violin bow on the Guitar like Jimmy Page
[0:30:15] <%Solidnick18> oooh

[0:31:05] <TheChucklingOak> And its a good game too
[0:31:06] <IndoorSitup> The logs are REAL GOOD.
[0:31:06] <DeltaD36> That's fair
[0:31:08] <%D00msDayDan> the audio logs don't really matter unless you collect all of them
[0:31:10] <%Dudealy> Dudealy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[0:31:12] <+yhom_tork> the logs are so good
[0:31:24] <+einherjarvalk> The logs tie the entire game together thematically
[0:31:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:31:25] <%hattrick61> Logs are highlighted so you won't find em all but you'd have to go out of your way to find none

[0:31:28] <+Ml33tninja> ODST is amazing. Easily my favorite halo
[0:31:29] <+einherjarvalk> they also change the ending
[0:31:30] <%a_goth_pancake> wait, so have you never played this V?
[0:31:33] <%Deadpal> oh. the logs only matter if you are 100% getting them.
[0:31:35] <%slimmixrp> Yeah logs have a cool ending if you get them all. In game secret encounter
[0:31:45] <black_pariah> dragon age is a great game that he should absolutely not play on stream
[0:31:47] <+Haildrops> do we say anything about the engineers
[0:31:47] <%D00msDayDan> are audio logs gonna be the goddamn cole protocol cole protocol keyes terminal of this LP
[0:31:48] <+Ne1son> Please don't play Dragon Age
[0:31:48] <TheChucklingOak> So you're saying there's a chance

[0:31:54] <+wunp_fxs> old bioware
[0:31:54] <$usotaku013666> There are (I think) 29 logs. You’re probably not gonna find them all, but they are rad.

[0:32:17] <Depthcharge2030> Jade Empire wen
[0:32:17] <Dave_VD> Mass effect would be way more sick

[0:32:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> fuck 3
[0:32:22] <TheChucklingOak> I think 2 was actually shorter, so I GUESS that might be feasible for an LP?

[0:39:55] <EnderGamma> probably one of the best OST of Halo
[0:39:55] <$usotaku013666> Audio is good now

[0:40:02] <%thechungiestofbois> YOU LIKE JAZZ?
[0:40:03] <+Grayhammatter> ya like jazz?
[0:40:07] <%a_goth_pancake> woolie, drown out your audio with smooth jazz.
[0:40:07] <%libra_zero> TIME4JAZZ
[0:40:08] <correctedsun117> Smoooooth
[0:40:09] <derap41> Some good Jazz
[0:40:09] <+Avossk_> Ya like Jaaaaazz?
[0:40:10] <%Solidnick18> i haven't seen this game in a long time
[0:40:11] <%usetheboost3d> does this game have guns, should I ask my mom permission to watch
[0:40:12] <Joestar1890> Ya like jazz?
[0:40:12] <%Eaglestrike117> Are they doing new mobassa streets? They better b e
[0:40:13] <Louie_Salmon> Wait it's actually called Halo 3 ODST? I forgot it had 3 in the title
[0:40:18] <%StabbityStyle> this game really doesn't have that much jazz. y'all been hyping it up too much.
[0:40:21] <%Solidnick18> That gundam is fucking awesome
[0:40:21] <+Kotyc_> 🎷 woolieGASM
[0:40:22] <+Haildrops> it's in the 3 engine so they kept the number
[0:40:23] <CappuccinoGuil> 🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷
[0:40:24] <%a_goth_pancake> actual best halo soundtrack
[0:40:25] <Ynkubus_> The Real G Project is the shit
[0:40:26] <brachydios777> Thunderbolt so good!
[0:40:29] <sapphire475gs> Man, it's a bummer, though... this game loses a bit of intrigue without the audio logs all collected. There's so much conversation material in it. I could only plead that Woolie watch a video of all the audio logs before getting to the last level string.
[0:40:30] <hot_take_jake> *TOOTING INTENSIFIES* 🎺🎺🎺
[0:40:31] <$JamesCorck> Favourite score of the Halo games, but that's my very super wrong opinion.
[0:40:35] <%a_goth_pancake> 🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷
[0:40:36] <Bespokecloud9> Takes place during 2 but called 3 BTW
[0:40:37] <MayorRev> the gundam robot is being tested
[0:40:45] <derap41> Its a smaller experience so
[0:40:47] <cpt_rezz> The best Halo game
[0:40:47] <CappuccinoGuil> SingsMic SingsMic SingsMic SingsMic 🎷🎷🎷🎷
[0:40:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Oh God...
[0:40:50] <iamtheTwitchghost> i only played it when it came out as well
[0:40:52] <%Javaa01> @Louie_Salmon Yeah they had to call it Halo 3 ODST because the multiplayer in this game is still just the same old Halo 3 multiplayer
[0:40:52] <correctedsun117> D-d-d-double blind
[0:40:55] <+BigBlackBankai> @Louie_Salmon always was...
[0:40:58] <$jake5713> Snake Jazz.
[0:40:59] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I can't wait for the PSO2 boss fight that has a VERY sassy saxaphone in it's boss theme to be added to the global version
[0:41:01] <Joestar1890> @Louie_Salmon Yeah, the weirdest part is that it takes place during 2 and it only has 3 in the title because Microsoft said it would sell more
[0:41:02] <+BoBoGaijin> jiyuGrin jiyuGrin jiyuGrin
[0:41:09] <+Vijuani> I only played this to get the Recon armor
[0:41:13] <AndyAsteroid> Terminals are a MUST
[0:41:14] <TheChucklingOak> The gundam robot will help us fight Elon Musk's Mars colonists in the future
[0:41:15] <+Toshatron> The terminals are big huge in this game comapred to the others
[0:41:16] <+Pop_O_Matic> @Louie_Salmon Yeah, it was originally meant to be DLC for 3, but it kinda grew far past the scope for that and became big enough to warrant a full, stand-alone release
[0:41:16] <+maenos2> Cole protocol tho
[0:41:17] <$JamesCorck> Check the logs afterwards, yeah. Don't get obsessed with them. Prepare the tissues though.
[0:41:19] <%usetheboost3d> woolieLORE
[0:41:21] <VidulaSaix> And hes also not asking for advice
[0:41:22] <%Solidnick18> i liked this one
[0:41:24] <+TheShisno> This is known
[0:41:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> FAKE FAN
[0:41:25] <DemonicHoward> dont do playlist
[0:41:27] <brachydios777> Let’s cool it with the lore this time chat
[0:41:29] <+maffblunge> listening to the collectible audio logs all at once is definitely the way to go anyway
[0:41:30] <hot_take_jake> The terminals are hard in this one, but the way the game directs you to them is real Neat-o
[0:41:31] <Halospaz117> It was a good game
[0:41:32] <tanarath> Terminals are highlighted, so you'll find some.
[0:41:34] <%hattrick61> NO DO IT PERFECT FIRST TRY
[0:41:35] <f0rgeman> phew
[0:41:35] <%gatorafan> you heard that chat?
[0:41:36] <$emptyantics> Lets fucking goooooo
[0:41:38] <%Joe2187> Better than 3 in every way
[0:41:38] <Divryne> No you have to collect all the achievos it’s the law.
[0:41:39] <%libra_zero> has V played any of the 343-made games?
[0:41:43] <%Solidnick18> be cool chat like jazz
[0:41:43] <The_Swedish_X> Big hero
[0:41:44] <%DomunDomunDomun> I'm so glad we have Halo lore and trick expert Little V Mills on this LP.
[0:41:44] <+condemned_15> "I'm not an expert," Little V - Cole Protocol Expert
[0:41:44] <$JamesCorck> There's many tears in those terminals. Tearminals.
[0:41:46] <+enternius> SourPls
[0:41:46] <nxflre> why no playlist chat?
[0:41:47] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> majinoPoint woolieONEGUY
[0:41:47] <TheChucklingOak> All right, Full screen time
[0:41:49] <%slimmixrp> Like none
[0:41:49] <Joestar1890> Haven't beat it yet. But it's pretty high in my tier list so far
[0:41:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'm getting slight Parasite Eve vibes from the very start of that menu theme. Probably just because of rewatching the LP.
[0:41:51] <KapitanOrient> not much
[0:41:51] <marvel877> none
[0:41:51] <%hattrick61> PUCKER UP MARINES

[0:42:10] <%hattrick61> THE DEAD SPEAK
[0:42:10] <+einherjarvalk> Woolie should just go get the logs afterwards and then have a bonus video where he just plays them in order like the Doom LP lore eps

[0:46:48] <TheChucklingOak> Man that intro gives me chills
[0:46:48] <%doomerskeletor13> ODST are like human Spartans. Best of the best without augmentation
[0:46:49] <+vaporousTippler> More like Personfall.
[0:46:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ?
[0:46:53] <+wunp_fxs> yep
[0:46:53] <Halospaz117> Anyone else manage to spot In Amber Clad?

[0:46:59] <%usetheboost3d> Dudefall
[0:47:09] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> ODST are the spartans of regular marines
[0:47:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Just dudes
[0:47:14] <%a_goth_pancake> @linsp well it's essentially a one time use deployment vehicle, so the answer is exorbitantly expensive.
[0:47:14] <+Grayhammatter> dudefall
[0:47:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> probably just roided
[0:47:16] <+Walopoh> Yep just badass people
[0:47:16] <Dynamo_Commando> is there Any halo LORE that explains how g's or force you experience in those drop pods?
[0:47:18] <Halospaz117> Just rad dudes
[0:47:21] <+Kingtut9009> Wasn't Sgt Johnson enhanced?
[0:47:23] <%Javaa01> ODSTs are just regularly juiced dudes
[0:47:23] <froglorn> isn't it mentioned that a big number of odst's die in the fall reather than on the field?
[0:47:24] <privatecorgi> Just dudes bein pals
[0:47:25] <brachydios777> Hmmmmm
[0:47:26] <+MaikuKnight> dude bro energy tho
[0:47:27] <Joestar1890> 6 hours
[0:47:27] <%Solidnick18> rook yeeee
[0:47:28] <%Shardlab> Spartan 3's and Spartan 4's
[0:47:28] <+BlondieFDM> ODST's can still flip vehicles, at least in game
[0:47:28] <mehfromBL> And then there's Sergeant Forge
[0:47:29] <DatAsuna> ODST is top tier normal human
[0:47:29] <+BigBlackBankai> Not yet.
[0:47:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @huskarl_zap
[0:47:35] <InvisibleMan101> if they were any better they would be spartans
[0:47:36] <%Shardlab> ....Woolie.... you're right
[0:47:38] <tomsawyer27> So spartan 3's :p
[0:47:39] <+einherjarvalk> woolie is describing Spartan IIIs
[0:47:39] <Djinnazz> Babies with guns
[0:47:40] <huskarl_zap> Spartan scouts
[0:47:40] <%D00msDayDan> @Kingtut9009 project ORION was a limited scope project with enhancements that weren't worth it
[0:47:42] <kormael> who told woolie about the IIIs????:
[0:47:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Kingtut9009 Johnson was a Spartan I
[0:47:45] <Babbott_Orion> basically spartan 2s were abducted as kids
[0:47:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Spartan Grunts
[0:47:45] <+Raskateer> spartan-9s are just dogs with knives tied to their tails
[0:47:47] <+Toshatron> basically III's LUL
[0:47:47] <%libra_zero> Spartan-I's were pretty much that
[0:47:50] <%Joe2187> ODST are the green berets
[0:47:52] <+MaikuKnight> time for lore
[0:47:53] <%doomerskeletor13> ODSTs actually got some MJLONIR tech on their armor, but it’s super limited
[0:47:54] <+wunp_fxs> night time baby
[0:47:56] <voyagerwitch> the spartan Keith Halo was a real weaksauce
[0:47:56] <DatAsuna> and that's why I like odsts lol
[0:47:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Jesus that's a high FOV
[0:47:58] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @dynamo_commando I can't imagine its any worse than real life reentry
[0:48:01] <%RyTYoung> A lot of bad things
[0:48:02] <Bigyanno> O D S T BAYBEEEE
[0:48:05] <Djinnazz> I do not like this hud
[0:48:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just a normal guy
[0:48:08] <+condemned_15> no shields
[0:48:10] <+Walopoh> The Halo series HATES Africa LUL
[0:48:12] <The_Swedish_X> Health is back
[0:48:13] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> NO SHIELDS BTW
[0:48:16] <subjectg> welcome to the urban jungle
[0:48:17] <huskarl_zap> we droped in boyz
[0:48:17] <%slimmixrp> Why grenade
[0:48:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Youre not a super soldier
[0:48:24] <The_Swedish_X> Button check
[0:48:29] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Fun Fact bungie hid a teaser for Destiny 1 in this game
[0:48:29] <%RyTYoung> You have weak knees
[0:48:32] <%D00msDayDan> you technically still have shields, just no ui for it
[0:48:32] <%usetheboost3d> remember that time John Halo and a bunch of other kids got tortured into doing a thousand push-ups
[0:48:33] <+khalcipher> Why not?
[0:48:36] <thatsocrunchy> So is this before or after reach? I forgot the order of the spinoffs
[0:48:40] <marvel877> toggle to crouch? ewww
[0:48:42] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @walopoh I mean tbf africa gets all the cool stuff, it just gets super fucked because of that
[0:48:45] <The_Swedish_X> Came out before Reach
[0:48:45] <mehfromBL> After.
[0:48:46] <+khalcipher> After
[0:48:47] <%D00msDayDan> @thatsocrunchy this came out a year before reach
[0:48:53] <%krispen_wa> canonically takes place after
[0:48:55] <mehfromBL> oh i meant in story
[0:48:56] <%R0bobot> music distorted for anyone else?
[0:48:57] <fearhurst> africa had the space elevator
[0:48:57] <+Kotyc_> a t m o s p h e r e
[0:48:58] <+Haildrops> hold crouch on controller is a pain i nthe ass @marvel877
[0:49:00] <+BigBlackBankai> Africa is used to invasion from religious zealots...
[0:49:00] <Halospaz117> Takes place after, came out before
[0:49:01] <$GiantPapaDoug> @thatsocrunchy this is in the middle of halo 2. came out a year after halo 3
[0:49:01] <brachydios777> This is during and after 2
[0:49:01] <+Toshatron> canon: everything is after reach, Release: before
[0:49:04] <dinnydanny777> Let's do the ODST# :)
[0:49:04] <Dynamo_Commando> timeline wise odst is after reach
[0:49:04] <+Kotyc_> i m m e r s i o n
[0:49:05] <%krispen_wa> takes place during halo 2
[0:49:08] <%R0bobot> no wait it's fine
[0:49:09] <Djinnazz> You got the baby bitch armor
[0:49:10] <%DomunDomunDomun> BLOODY SCREEN so real
[0:49:13] <ralphfromdk> biggest difference.... you're short as fuck
[0:49:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> STAMINA
[0:49:20] <thatsocrunchy> Got it thanks @d00msdaydan
[0:49:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> so shields
[0:49:22] <subjectg> BLOODY SCREEN
[0:49:23] <viridianowl> s a d j a z z
[0:49:25] <subjectg> SO REAL
[0:49:26] <The_Swedish_X> Press x for night vision
[0:49:27] <%deathscythe122887> deathscythe122887 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[0:49:28] <+MaikuKnight> pretty neat that they don't drop side by side
[0:49:34] <dinnydanny777> So does this qualify as survival horror?
[0:49:36] <%JohnAtDawn> Detective mode
[0:49:39] <sapphire475gs> Press X to see anything.
[0:49:44] <+condemned_15> pistol has scope
[0:49:45] <Bigyanno> I just started playing this again myself and holy hell do I love that pistol
[0:49:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pistol is god here
[0:49:49] <%RyTYoung> @dinnydanny777 somewhat in atmosphere
[0:49:51] <AppleBerryKitty> remember pistols are your friend
[0:49:54] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> woolie immediately going guns blazing in the stealth game
[0:49:57] <%D00msDayDan> odst fun fact: the automag fucks
[0:49:59] <sapphire475gs> Pistol WOULD be god here, but Woolie.
[0:50:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Turn on the VISR
[0:50:03] <subjectg> brutes have actual shields this time
[0:50:07] <mehfromBL> So has Woolie figured out the concept of effective range yet? Namely how short it is on automatics
[0:50:07] <+Toshatron> Automag is bae
[0:50:08] <+MaikuKnight> Why did they play Reach before ODST?
[0:50:08] <+DukeAtomic> ODST came out before Reach
[0:50:10] <marvel877> hated sprint
[0:50:12] <%a_goth_pancake> """"""silenced""""""
[0:50:13] <%Mr_Strut> That pistol doesn't look silenced
[0:50:17] <TheChucklingOak> Makin my way downtown
[0:50:19] <dinnydanny777> Real Halo fans power walk everywhere LUL
[0:50:20] <%StabbityStyle> it's integrated
[0:50:21] <+egalitarian696969> no sprint Kreygasm
[0:50:22] <+ArcanumArcanum> "took them out" lmao they walked away woolie
[0:50:23] <KapitanOrient> DID SOMEBODY SAY SPRINT?! HotPokket HotPokket Kappa
[0:50:23] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @d00msdaydan why would I ever want a full auto weapon in a halo game tho
[0:50:25] <subjectg> it’s a big ass suppressor
[0:50:27] <+Avossk_> Keep in mind, this game came BEFORE Reach
[0:50:28] <AppleBerryKitty> halo normal vehicles are always so weird
[0:50:28] <marvel877> @MaikuKnight because that's how they were released on MCC
[0:50:29] <%DomunDomunDomun> @MaikuKnight Because ODST wasn't out on PC until yesterday.
[0:50:29] <+Walopoh> Halo 3's default walk is faster speed than Sprint in any of the later games
[0:50:34] <sniffy77> Headshots only
[0:50:34] <%Slimshazbot> But DO NOT use the pistol on shields
[0:50:35] <TheChucklingOak> Pistol is internally silenced. That's why its bulky on the front
[0:50:38] <sapphire475gs> Pistol will still alert when firing near enemies.
[0:50:40] <Dynamo_Commando> pistol must be integrated suppresor
[0:50:41] <mehfromBL> Not yet at least
[0:50:41] <+MaikuKnight> ah ok - that makes sense
[0:50:42] <eliudfs1> you can zoom in with pistol
[0:50:43] <%Josef_Stryker> Basically the Falcon to Cap
[0:50:44] <zamzoph> just got here. Are they watching the side story too?
[0:50:48] <+shapeforn> I never minded sprint
[0:50:48] <+RedKazoo> Non-GMO Badasses
[0:50:51] <+MaikuKnight> thanks
[0:50:52] <KapitanOrient> LUL
[0:50:54] <Halospaz117> It's a really cool helmet tho
[0:50:58] <%RyTYoung> I like this pistol design more than the og pistol
[0:51:00] <prime_name> I like the shoulder pads
[0:51:00] <dinnydanny777> Kind of more badass than Master Chief cause you're just some guy dealing with all of this shit
[0:51:03] <%usetheboost3d> looks like Portland
[0:51:08] <+BoBoGaijin> find the destiny easter egg lol
[0:51:09] <voyagerwitch> you're the sokka
[0:51:10] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @redkazoo please tell me thats an in-universe term
[0:51:11] <%a_goth_pancake> you ARE super badasses, you shoot to the surface from orbit in paper thin coffins
[0:51:14] <Djinnazz> Is this Detroit?
[0:51:17] <%Mr_Strut> So shouldn't the problem be solved by now?
[0:51:18] <%Eaglestrike117> No it was a different drop that you were in
[0:51:18] <NeroInfinite> Looks like anormal day in chicago
[0:51:21] <subjectg> destiny easter egg got removed in this version
[0:51:22] <%Eaglestrike117> you came in after chief
[0:51:22] <+condemned_15> the covenant ship that jumped was the one we followed to the 2nd Halo
[0:51:23] <The_Swedish_X> Cant believe Detroit was in Africa all along
[0:51:25] <LiloAndStitchIceCreamGuy> SURVIVE
[0:51:26] <%krispen_wa> SURVIVE
[0:51:26] <%D00msDayDan> @BoBoGaijin 343 cut the destiny easter egg in mcc, it just says "for her" now with a picture of earth
[0:51:27] <+Walopoh> SURVIVE
[0:51:27] <+RedKazoo> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug It SHOULD be
[0:51:30] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @djinnazz it might as well be african halo
[0:51:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Wasnt the town razes by the rupture in 2?
[0:51:30] <mehfromBL> Buck's official character description includes "If he were any better, he'd be a Spartan" iirc
[0:51:32] <%doomerskeletor13> And we already met Buck briefly back in Reach
[0:51:35] <+BigBlackBankai> This is my favorite pistol, even more than CE
[0:51:35] <Bigyanno> ODST is much much slower paced than other games and I hope they don't rush it
[0:51:37] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @redkazoo IT REALLY SHOULD
[0:51:38] <+DesertPenguin> This is during 2 or 3?
[0:51:38] <Idon__> Objective: ????
[0:51:40] <+BoBoGaijin> @D00msDayDan lame...
[0:51:42] <%JohnAtDawn> VIRI
[0:51:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> Need immediate medical assistance?
[0:51:44] <%hattrick61> @desertpenguin 2
[0:51:46] <%doomerskeletor13> @mehfrombl Kappa hmmm
[0:51:46] <%JohnAtDawn> VIRGIL!
[0:51:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Choose Optican
[0:51:52] <DeadLemmy666> VISOR FOREVER
[0:51:53] <mehfromBL> It's what happened back on Earth while Chief was on Delta Halo
[0:51:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> Healthcare on demand, get rekt Europe
[0:51:56] <%usetheboost3d> @desertpenguin pretty sure 2
[0:51:58] <TangoNango> Objective: Survive
[0:52:01] <subjectg> Need medical assistance? Choose Optican
[0:52:03] <+DesertPenguin> thanks
[0:52:05] <Dynamo_Commando> that pistol seems more logicwl for marines and soldiers to use, whereas the ce pistol feels more like something a spartan would use more often
[0:52:09] <sapphire475gs> Objective: kill the CORRECT patrol.
[0:52:14] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @djinnazz I mean african detroit woops
[0:52:15] <The_Swedish_X> Welcome back to Halo 3, basically.
[0:52:22] <brachydios777> I love the silent smg
[0:52:23] <+einherjarvalk> someone tell Woolie he can zoom the new SMG
[0:52:24] <dinnydanny777> That muzzle flash on the smg is beautiful
[0:52:25] <DatAsuna> damn that smg is a laser
[0:52:30] <%slimmixrp> Greata pbservation
[0:52:31] <DatAsuna> no recoil
[0:52:33] <dinnydanny777> Game has nice visual design
[0:52:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> @The_Swedish_X between 2 & 3
[0:52:39] <%slimmixrp> Great
[0:52:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1308260203280949248?s=20
[0:52:40] <%Eaglestrike117> No he's mid jump
[0:52:43] <+IntrepidEye> Nope. Chief won't get there for another two weeks
[0:52:46] <%alpacasintophats> he's mid jump currently
[0:52:51] <+DukeAtomic> Welcome to the Destiny Proto-Alpha
[0:52:53] <%alpacasintophats> Schism has not happened yet
[0:52:54] <The_Swedish_X> @Melchior_the_Wise I know the timeline. I'm talking gameplay.
[0:52:58] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> chat is this before or after the race war
[0:52:59] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You have a map!
[0:53:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Press the D-pad for a guide
[0:53:03] <%Eaglestrike117> It takes 2 weeks to get to halo, this is before the elites got fucked
[0:53:03] <KapitanOrient> use you map
[0:53:05] <%unclekulikov> unclekulikov subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Woo! It's been a great time to finish these fights!
[0:53:05] <ralphfromdk> This music though...
[0:53:13] <Joestar1890> @alpacasintophats Actually, it kinda did?
[0:53:16] <%D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus if you turn off VISR you can actually see the colors on doors
[0:53:17] <sapphire475gs> He doesn't have a map until the game tells him he has a map.
[0:53:17] <chainsaw105> you have to kill all the enemies here before your next objective comes up right?
[0:53:21] <marvel877> this will be a long LP...
[0:53:24] <%Javaa01> It looks better when you turn off the visor
[0:53:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @razieltano123 He doesn't have the map unlocled yet
[0:53:31] <+DukeAtomic> It looks really different with the VISR turned off
[0:53:33] <razieltano123> Shit
[0:53:33] <Bigyanno> This game is much better for Woolie's tendency to perimiter sweep
[0:53:35] <+Toshatron> this makes me wish they actually did something with HUNTtheTRUTH
[0:53:35] <Thepothero> I thought it was during the race war?
[0:53:37] <%unclekulikov> Does the Visor alter the lighting?
[0:53:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> The bloom though
[0:53:40] <mehfromBL> iirc Buck comes across a bunch of dead elites and brutes in a room and notes that it looks like they killed each other. So if nothing else the Brutes have gotten the kill order

[0:54:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I would love another ODST style game!
[0:54:59] <Dynamo_Commando> Brutes are real BIG BOIS in this game.
[0:54:59] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> they playing on heroic?
[0:55:03] <Dave_VD> Woolie still has yet to learn the distinction of precision weapons

[0:56:38] <dinnydanny777> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug Oh I know, it's just funny to think of them doing it against two random Soldiermans
[0:56:43] <sapphire475gs> Gee... WHY IS IT NAMED VERGIL?
[0:56:47] <%a_goth_pancake> pseudo open world
[0:57:02] <marvel877> We will be staring at this map for hours in this LP. I can feel it.
[0:57:11] <+DukeAtomic> Map: The LP
[0:57:13] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sapphire475gs its probably some reference to Dantes inferno or something. still motivated/10
[0:57:15] <Bigyanno> It's a nice map tho
[0:57:16] <prime_name> It's kinda like Metroid Prime
[0:57:20] <TheChucklingOak> Detective Simulator 2552
[0:57:24] <%StabbityStyle> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug hopefully they just watch the full video of them on youtube afterwards, then
[0:57:27] <%LoganWulfric> This game does have heavy Metroid Prime vibes for the rookie sections
[0:57:30] <%D00msDayDan> skyrim compass lol
[0:57:33] <viridianowl> So Halo Infinite before Halo Infinite
[0:57:45] <brachydios777> Detective Rookie
[0:57:46] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @stabbitystyle woolie said he would, but probably not on stream
[0:57:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's so good
[0:57:48] <%Javaa01> Freeform and jazzy, one could say
[0:57:48] <+Avossk_> ODST has a hub world
[0:57:48] <mehfromBL> I remember more than a few fanfics deciding that the "D" in the Rookie's initials stand for Dante because of Vergil existing
[0:57:51] <%RyTYoung> @viridianowl pretty much
[0:57:53] <+tacostarvedbeast> would be an oblivion compass at this point when the game came out right?
[0:57:53] <$emptyantics> If reach didn’t exist this would be the Best Halo next to 2
[0:57:54] <%hattrick61> See that mountain?
[0:57:56] <Bigyanno> ODST is chill as fuck compared to every other halo game
[0:57:57] <sapphire475gs> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Oops. My mistake. "/s" The audio logs talk about what "Vergil" is.
[0:57:58] <Explodincatz> I despise this compass
[0:57:59] <The_Swedish_X> There are some more straightforward missions, I believe.
[0:58:01] <%doomerskeletor13> @viridianowl Ye. Although the original Halo was intended to be open world on the ring too
[0:58:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> boodoobeeboop
[0:58:06] <Dynamo_Commando> How Comedically Divine of Vergil to lead the player.
[0:58:08] <JaceDarkstar> I'm playing through right now. going for the audio logs achievements
[0:58:09] <$RunningNGunning> Microsoft already owns Halo Kappa
[0:58:12] <@Menitta> Helo
[0:58:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The fact that Bungie pulled this out during Reach's development is incredible
[0:58:15] <%StabbityStyle> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug fair enough. as long as he sees it, that's good. it's too cool to not see
[0:58:21] <+kd2jag> I have that superintendent sound for notifications on my phone. Keep checking it instinctively.
[0:58:27] <Jessie_Lockhart> There he is in the upper right
[0:58:30] <mehfromBL> I'm inclined to accept that the D in JD stands for Dante instead of the more obvious Doe
[0:58:32] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sapphire475gs not surprised. halo loves their BIBBLE (and fan cannon bibble AUs)
[0:58:44] <TheChucklingOak> Huh, I never realized the signifigance of the name there. I thought it was just a random one they chose.
[0:58:49] <f0rgeman> game journalist mode
[0:58:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Also, signs in the environment will change to point the way
[0:59:02] <Sullry> i love how the signs tell you where to go
[0:59:04] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @stabbitystyle I'm playing through odst right now and it's REALLY COOL to see how generic, not military people deal with the covenant
[0:59:11] <dinnydanny777> So when do we find a terminal with the password Donte
[0:59:18] <%doomerskeletor13> I love how different this game is. I want another game like this
[0:59:20] <@Menitta> Oh wooow
[0:59:23] <+yhom_tork> HMMMM
[0:59:23] <mehfromBL> no longer John Halo, or John Reach, you are now John Dante

[0:59:28] <+God_Of_Oreos> I realized that too its so cool how the city directs you
[0:59:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Go this way" "HEY LISTEN!"
[0:59:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That's The Superintendent
[0:59:35] <%slimmixrp> I never ever saw that

[1:00:00] <%a_goth_pancake> this game is so cool, the environment points you in the right direction.
[1:00:02] <TheChucklingOak> It's the Arkham game problem
[1:00:02] <The_Swedish_X> Never not have the hud
[1:00:03] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> note: they did, in fact, glass this
[1:00:03] <%D00msDayDan> to enjoy the beautiful lighting
[1:00:05] <+yhom_tork> NEVER TURN IT OFF
[1:00:05] <+TheIntellectional> the carbine slaps so hard in odst for like no reason
[1:00:05] <Halospaz117> For atmoshpere
[1:00:06] <%Javaa01> The game looks nicer without it on
[1:00:06] <Bigyanno> There are reasons to turn it off later

[1:00:29] <%doomerskeletor13> “What are you gonna do, glass us” -Man who was glassed
[1:00:32] <AppleBerryKitty> ITs too dark (way too dark) to not have the hud on anyway...so yeah
[1:00:36] <Halospaz117> Wanna say it came out a bit after?
[1:00:37] <%StabbityStyle> i love how the visor highlights the trees/grass here
[1:00:38] <+RedKazoo> Never asked for this P I S S Filter
[1:00:39] <CappuccinoGuil> For screenshots
[1:00:43] <mehfromBL> I turn it since as we just saw, plasma can get unbearably bright with it on
[1:00:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Chat, shut up about plot
[1:00:45] <derap41> playing this in multiplayer kinda ruins it
[1:00:45] <+DukeAtomic> Gonna be awesome if it's ever sunny out

[1:00:51] <sapphire475gs> @ZeroCruz That's... actually RATHER accurate.
[1:00:52] <+BlondieFDM> The only time you turn the visor off is when you're in a bright area
[1:00:54] <+DukeAtomic> Lemme just uhhh put on this night vision in the sun
[1:00:55] <Halospaz117> Man I love the sounds of these guns
[1:00:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> Night vision during the day = RIP Eyeballs
[1:00:57] <%a_goth_pancake> I like walking around with no hud, it's spooky
[1:00:57] <Bespokecloud9> When its day time youll know why youd turn the visor off
[1:00:58] <+Avossk_> Magnum is reaaaal good
[1:01:01] <+Walopoh> chat just don't say nothin
[1:01:01] <+DazedCookies> odst was 2009
[1:01:01] <%warlockwithapixie> no jazz yet
[1:01:02] <%StabbityStyle> smooth jazz happens for the first time after the first side mission
[1:01:03] <%RioGascar> Originally I believe the visor was gonna have upgrades
[1:01:07] <%Slimshazbot> Why is chat so extra shit when it comes to Halo streams?
[1:01:09] <Jashter18> Look at Woolie hitting his shots our boi is doing it
[1:01:09] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus ODST was 09, HR was 11
[1:01:12] <%RioGascar> and battery capacity

[1:01:16] <+DukeAtomic> there's the destiny poster

[1:01:23] <$GiantPapaDoug> yep
[1:01:25] <+DukeAtomic> Yes at the same time
[1:01:26] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @slimshazbot halo brings out the dumbass lore nuts in all of us
[1:01:27] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> This is making me want to go back and play this again

[1:01:29] <$GiantPapaDoug> there are playlists in halo 3
[1:01:30] <+DukeAtomic> They're in forge and multiplayer
[1:01:31] <%StabbityStyle> yeah, they added odst weapons to halo 3 multi

[1:04:30] <$kirin_fellwinter> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug Spartan IV'ss are literally elite marines and odst's chosen to recieve combat steroids and stims. they're below III's and barley above odst's
[1:04:30] <Nomad94> I don't really associate Nathan Fillion with anything. The name means nothing to me aside from Halo
[1:04:34] <JaceDarkstar> if he were any better he would be a spartan

[1:05:41] <Nomad94> is that supposed to be a slur now or something?
[1:05:42] <JaceDarkstar> context woolz
[1:05:44] <TheChucklingOak> It's a military thing, really
[1:05:45] <+vaporousTippler> Your room was EMPTY, Jack!
[1:05:46] <rowboat_girlyman> always gotta make it about race
[1:05:46] <%unclekulikov> *backstory*

[1:05:48] <+pistachio_the_nut> Is that a slur now?
[1:05:48] <huskarl_zap> GLOWS IN THE DARK
[1:05:50] <dinnydanny777> Well not ready, but they never did them
[1:05:50] <%StabbityStyle> spook has been slang for spy for like 50+ years
[1:05:55] <yusefHD> @pistachio_the_nut always has been lmao
[1:05:55] <Dynamo_Commando> Jack do you remeber what day is today?
[1:05:58] <%RioGascar> Can you tell what writing style they are inspired by?
[1:05:58] <sapphire475gs> "They did bed things, you guys!"
[1:05:58] <Bigyanno> Gorram is actually old west swearing
[1:05:59] <+MessyBristles> @Nomad94 it began as a slur lol
[1:06:00] <MillaMoks> No woolie, its actual military slang
[1:06:00] <subjectg> “Spook” is a term for secret agents for your favorite 3-letter agency
[1:06:01] <PentagramJ2> thats been a thing, I dont think I heard the other alternative until I was in middle school? Its meant spy for a long ass time
[1:06:01] <+tuchpi> why is Spooky racist now? lol
[1:06:02] <ThatGuyThere03> It's not future swearing it's actual slang
[1:06:05] <huskarl_zap> Dark souls calls ninjas spooks
[1:06:07] <+einherjarvalk> "spook" as slang for an intelligence op is a current term
[1:06:09] <%Javaa01> Spook has been a real term since the 2nd world war
[1:06:09] <KapitanOrient> catJAM
[1:06:10] <Nomad94> @MessyBristles well, I've never heard it used as such
[1:06:10] <MichaelDood> Good ol goram
[1:06:12] <+pistachio_the_nut> @yusefHD It always meant a government agent to me
[1:06:14] <%a_goth_pancake> gotta shoot these gorram covies
[1:06:15] <simulationbard> Spook is just a word for spy, it's been a word for spy for a long time
[1:06:16] <@akuda_bar> yeah people use it for that.
[1:06:19] <%DomunDomunDomun> You're both Buck.
[1:06:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so apparently it's both used for spies and as a slur... wtf

[1:13:07] <$nodnerbuil> Thats a bug
[1:13:11] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Turn it off then
[1:13:12] <%D00msDayDan> i really don't get why they moved the great schism up instead of putting enemy elites in this game
[1:13:14] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> why the fuck would a enemy civil war be classified!?
[1:13:15] <%mitchteck> Oh god turn off visor during day
[1:13:18] <+yhom_tork> yeah turn it off better
[1:13:18] <+Kotyc_> WutFace
[1:13:19] <%Reverend_Roscoe> what a waste of ammo at that distance
[1:13:21] <+cursedwithadhd> what shields?
[1:13:21] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:13:23] <mehfromBL> i don't think woolie killed anyone with that turret
[1:13:25] <PentagramJ2> HERE WE GO AGAIN
[1:13:25] <+RahuHordika> MY EYES
[1:13:26] <subjectg> @d00msdaydan Elite AI in Halo 3 is not great
[1:13:27] <razieltano123> EYES!
[1:13:28] <Joestar1890> @unclekulikov ONI. ONI is the reason why
[1:13:28] <Bespokecloud9> BRUH
[1:13:28] <+Grayhammatter> oh god LUL
[1:13:29] <TheChucklingOak> "Hey the Elites might make for good distractions if our troops come upon them due to the schism. Should we inform the troops?" "Nah lol"
[1:13:29] <%RioGascar> God i have to wonfer how many people ONI got killed because of secrecy bullshit
[1:13:31] <pochecito> Goddamnit LUL
[1:13:31] <DatAsuna> ODSTs are weak
[1:13:31] <ArbyW> Howdy folks.
[1:13:33] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You unlocked your framerate while messing with the options, chances are that's fucking it up
[1:13:34] <%Eaglestrike117> Woolie please stop using the visor in broad daylight its blinding
[1:13:35] <%a_goth_pancake> CHIIIIIIIPS!!!
[1:13:35] <+wunp_fxs> really is a blind playthrough
[1:13:35] <DatAsuna> but apes together, strong
[1:13:39] <Paynexkiller> so bright
[1:13:39] <%DomunDomunDomun> It's classified because ONI are dicks.

[1:13:41] <+DukeAtomic> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck because ONI
[1:13:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Xisalex
[1:13:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Xisalex
[1:13:42] <mesamus> WOOLIE you are blinding us
[1:13:45] <+Avossk_> woolie just loves that self-flashbang button LUL
[1:13:48] <armchairmaster_> Let's get BLIND chat
[1:13:51] <+Thesson> woolie my son, please, he is very sick because of visr
[1:13:51] <Gallhint> woolie is not afraid to blind himself, the challenge makes him stronker
[1:13:53] <Sullry> literally unwatchable
[1:13:55] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Use your pistol, dude!
[1:13:55] <+ArcanumArcanum> @D00msDayDan because they just reused halo 3 engine and ai, and there's no enemy elites in that
[1:13:58] <+linSP> More bloom please
[1:14:01] <%Slimshazbot> So, one irksome thing, the fact that there are dead elites here makes no sense. This is literally IMMEDIATELY after the jump, there's no way regret is dead yet, so the schism hasn't happened yet. Unless Truth ordered the brutes to get a head start on things, but that seems like an unnecessarily risky move.
[1:14:02] <$Xisalex> "BLIND" is really accurate.
[1:14:02] <sapphire475gs> This is going to be wonderful... chat will suffer sardonically whenever Woollie forgets it's daytime and uses VISR.
[1:14:03] <ArbyW> Dude this level blinds you even if you don't have the visor on
[1:14:09] <Bespokecloud9> This is going to be painful LMAO
[1:14:09] <+BurkeBigsby> Obviously it doesn't bother him on his end.
[1:14:10] <Paynexkiller> gryffiLATE gryffiLATE gryffiLATE
[1:14:11] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> The headache LP
[1:14:12] <%D00msDayDan> @ArcanumArcanum there are if you teamkill enough during the covenant lol
[1:14:13] <ArbyW> there's so much bloom in this fucking game
[1:14:15] <subjectg> to be fair, not like woolie’s going any blinder from doing it
[1:14:15] <+MagiKestral> y'all please don't backseat. he doesn't read chat so it's just annoying lol
[1:14:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy fuck everyone chill he's getting used to it still
[1:14:19] <Decimated_body> Holy fuck chat
[1:14:20] <sapphire475gs> This is triple blind playthrough.
[1:14:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> this is like watching someone play with the brightness turned all the way up
[1:14:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> "nothing cool"
[1:14:25] <+einherjarvalk> the Brutes always had contempt for the Elites, they just jumped the gun here
[1:14:27] <Dynamo_Commando> note to self: any information in the halo wolrd is on a need to know basis.
[1:14:29] <Bigyanno> Is this whitey vision? Is this how Woolie sees the world
[1:14:33] <Joestar1890> @ArcanumArcanum Which is weird because if you revive the Elites via console, they are designated as enemies
[1:14:36] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Use your pistol
[1:14:37] <dinnydanny777> Weak knees LUL
[1:14:38] <+einherjarvalk> ONI clearly knew about it too
[1:14:39] <chainsaw105> flesh shields
[1:14:41] <Gallhint> its not backseating to say dont use nightvision in the day lmao
[1:14:42] <%Solidnick18> the visor is OP pls nerf LUL
[1:14:49] <@akuda_bar> he'll figure it out
[1:14:51] <AppleBerryKitty> I still don't know how I ran pass all this part on legendary in 1 try. I got stuck on the other side tho.
[1:14:54] <@akuda_bar> there's no need to whinge about it
[1:15:02] <brachydios777> Got noob combo going on
[1:15:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> Red screen
[1:15:04] <Sullry> muh backseating stfu chat
[1:15:06] <%a_goth_pancake> sniper would be a good idea
[1:15:07] <+linSP> Woolie with nightmare vision goggles, for him it’s the same
[1:15:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> and beeping when you take actual damage
[1:15:18] <sapphire475gs> Don't worry, some people are whining creatively. I approve of this whining.
[1:15:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie will indeed figure it out
[1:15:20] <+markypoo4L> V is really bad at explaining things
[1:15:20] <dinnydanny777> Everytime the ODST takes fall damage I want him to scream "my legs"
[1:15:22] <%RioGascar> Health is the top bar across the nav
[1:15:22] <Explodincatz> the UI in this game is terrible
[1:15:23] <+BurkeBigsby> Don't see how it's backseating to say that viewers of his stream cannot see the stream well... it may impact the LP on YT.
[1:15:23] <dinnydanny777> Idk why
[1:15:24] <DatAsuna> woolievs the concept of regenerating health
[1:15:25] <%a_goth_pancake> cod strawberry jelly
[1:15:40] <falconcrunchv2> it's not that's just a reach
[1:15:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Its incredible that accepted paradigms of game design are so foreign for Woolie

[1:16:54] <sapphire475gs> It's okay. The Covenant will turn off the VISR for you guys.
[1:16:56] <IndoorSitup> Only Woolie would think using Night Vision during the day is a good idea.
[1:16:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @tearfuldevil that's what amazing, that a man who's career revolves around games, NEVER PLAYED ANY of such examples
[1:17:05] <a_goth_pancake> le it was bad cover
[1:17:05] <%PirateDad_> I don't get the complaints. The screen looks fine either way
[1:17:05] <Joestar1890> SourPls
[1:17:12] <FunkyWaters> he literally couldn't see the enemies
[1:17:16] <subjectg> @admiral_popnfresh fighting games
[1:17:19] <+condemned_15> YEAH IT IS
[1:17:20] <+BurkeBigsby> I wonder what they could have done within reason to make ODST's feel different in this game. Like more recoil, inertia, new animations?
[1:17:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> 🤔
[1:17:20] <%StabbityStyle> the grenade arc in odst is so weird. i goes further than you think it should
[1:17:27] <%RioGascar> woolie never played splinter cell clearly. Where having night vision on during day BLINDS YOU
[1:17:28] <ragasquid> @woolieversus assault rifle is better at close range. pistol is better for long range
[1:17:30] <+yhom_tork> SourPls
[1:17:38] <tearfuldevil> @Admiral_PopnFresh his career didn't revolve around FPS' though
[1:17:38] <DoctorSpace> He doesn't hit the enemies when he can see them anyway
[1:17:47] <Joestar1890> @ragasquid Pistol doesn't break shields though
[1:17:47] <%a_goth_pancake> short, controlled bursts, woolz
[1:17:51] <dinnydanny777> This night vision making chat so mad is pretty funny ngl :)
[1:17:57] <+Walopoh> sniped
[1:17:58] <+Avossk_> AR is garbo in this game
[1:17:59] <$Xisalex> Yeah, Grenades in 3 and ODST have a weirdly "preemptive" arc, where they are angles above your Reticle. so weird.
[1:17:59] <IndoorSitup> Woolie... NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:18:01] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> This is amazing LUL
[1:18:05] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Woolie....
[1:18:08] <%Slimshazbot> @BurkeBigsby They did some small things. Weaker melee, lower jumps, slower movement when crouching, but I wish they went a bit further
[1:18:13] <tearfuldevil> @Admiral_PopnFresh similarly, i wouldn't expect a big fps man to know about, i dunno, charge partitioning
[1:18:14] <%Theycallmenerf> Chat you have to realize whenever you suggest or say Woolie should do XYZ, he will not. He’s playing this for the first time, relax.
[1:18:14] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> WOOLIE

[1:18:32] <subjectg> @xisalex probably had something to do with changing player height

[1:18:34] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> How does woolie function?
[1:18:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @tearfuldevil which is, again, amazing @subjectg what fighting game uses red vignette to indicate sustained damage?
[1:18:41] <Dynamo_Commando> heart rate monitor concerns me
[1:18:43] <DSD24> The panting threw me off when I first played this game
[1:18:44] <brachydios777> dtchatMartin
[1:18:44] <sapphire475gs> I knew it. The snipers are going to take Woolie out every time.
[1:18:47] <IndoorSitup> Only Woolie would think that using a Shotgun as a sniper is a good idea.
[1:18:49] <%Eaglestrike117> woolie the AR literally does no damage at long range, thats what you have THE PISTOL FOR. LONG RANGE
[1:18:49] <%ZeroCruz> He has played though all the games and still haven’t figured it out LUL
[1:18:51] <+cursedwithadhd> in pitch black no NVG
[1:18:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> The reticle is a good indicator of weapon range, red means close enough
[1:18:57] <jaygee303> Can’t wait for the hunters
[1:18:58] <+condemned_15> there is a health bar
[1:19:01] <+markypoo4L> Idk how people can watch woolie play this. He's played literally every Halo and still plays like this lmfao
[1:19:01] <fearhurst> the beep is each brain wave
[1:19:05] <armchairmaster_> To the people saying "It's not that bad", i tend to view things at a lower brightness that usual, and my eyes don't even have a specific medical condition tied to them. For the people in chat that DO have issues tied to brightness, this will be a HUGE ISSUE.
[1:19:07] <correctedsun117> Woolie will (NOT) figure it out
[1:19:08] <thebalticguy1> Use your pistol on the snipers
[1:19:13] <dinnydanny777> I find these voice clips kinda sound funny
[1:19:13] <sapphire475gs> Woolie will NEVER properly use a precision weapon.
[1:19:18] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Woolie sees a pistol "nah this is useless"
[1:19:24] <IndoorSitup> @markypoo4l Dude has been carried by Little V
[1:19:26] <subjectg> @admiral_popnfresh nah it’s just poking fun at the whole “all he knows is fight gaem” thingg
[1:19:29] <%D00msDayDan> @thebalticguy1 he'd have to use the pistol at all first
[1:19:33] <Striker23332> Bold of you to assume he can aim
[1:19:33] <+Avossk_> Woolie just need to remember that Pistol = BR in this game
[1:19:34] <+linSP> Squishy non super solider human mode

[1:19:53] <Sora9567> Well to be fair, the ODST magnum is below the Halo CE and Reach Magnum but above the Halo 2 Magnum
[1:19:56] <+BurkeBigsby> There's no BR in ODST?
[1:19:56] <NeroInfinite> We don't watch woolie because he's good at Halo we watch woolie because he's experiencing Halo.
[1:19:56] <f0rgeman> omg he's learnding
[1:19:57] <tearfuldevil> yeah its not a "EW PLAYING WRONG" thing, its a "i cnanot actually look at the gameplay becaus eit hurts my eyeballs"

[1:23:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I know where this is going
[1:23:39] <%Slimshazbot> They were in Reachm but V killed them before Woolie got to see them.
[1:23:42] <+Avossk_> is the audio desynched in the cutscene?
[1:23:45] <LordOfThePoultry> WHEEEEE
[1:23:50] <yusefHD> RIP Wildlings
[1:23:51] <%a_goth_pancake> YEEF
[1:23:56] <+MagiKestral> I think audio might be desync'd on woolie's end
[1:23:58] <Sora9567> Audio's always been a little funky in ODST
[1:23:59] <+chunkyfranku> desync in audio?
[1:24:01] <brachydios777> t101YEET
[1:24:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> desync
[1:24:10] <iamtheTwitchghost> not sure if it's the game
[1:24:11] <yusefHD> Little V Sync
[1:24:13] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[1:24:19] <Sora9567> It's the game. It happened to me yesterday.
[1:24:21] <infernalram> not desynced?
[1:24:22] <AppleBerryKitty> i think that was just in game
[1:24:23] <+MaikuKnight> CAYDE
[1:24:24] <Joestar1890> @Avossk_ It was, but I thought it was just my computer
[1:24:27] <+chunkyfranku> nevermind
[1:24:29] <Dynamo_Commando> i don't hear or see the desync, anybody else?
[1:24:34] <mehfromBL> Romeo you ignorant slut
[1:24:35] <sapphire475gs> I have no desync. Try refresh?
[1:24:37] <%Slimshazbot> No desync for me?
[1:24:38] <iamtheTwitchghost> seems good now
[1:24:40] <fearhurst> im fine
[1:24:41] <Explodincatz> its the captions being off
[1:24:41] <MajoraZ> JAZZ TIME
[1:24:41] <+Avossk_> looks like the desync fixed itself
[1:24:42] <subjectg> was it just the sniper shot that was desynched? Cuz that might be intentional
[1:24:42] <%a_goth_pancake> how'd he hear that head shake?
[1:24:42] <phantalime> I refreshed then it was fine
[1:24:43] <Sora9567> It's only like a quarter of a second for some cutscenes.
[1:24:43] <%D00msDayDan> it was desycned when romeo shot the engineer but not anymore
[1:24:44] <iamtheTwitchghost> probably just the cutscene
[1:24:46] <+chunkyfranku> I guess it's when loud noises are happening
[1:24:47] <f0rgeman> here it comes
[1:24:48] <stormhawk9891> HERE IT COMES BOYS

[1:27:07] <%hattrick61> @sora9567 ye
[1:27:08] <+Haildrops> this sounds like the sad song that plays just after Kat dies in Reach
[1:27:09] <%D00msDayDan> @Halospaz117 and then using said shotguns at long range
[1:27:10] <+Avossk_> Shotty kinda got nerfed in thie game
[1:27:12] <+Haildrops> in the glassed ruins
[1:27:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> This isnt jazz

[1:27:29] <dinnydanny777> Yeah this definitely isn't jazz
[1:27:30] <%Solidnick18> 🎷
[1:27:30] <%DomunDomunDomun> The signs lead to the audio logs too.
[1:27:33] <+SpcOpsBear> Just got back from receiving a guest and I missed pretty much the entire beginning area.
[1:27:33] <+Avossk_> Mmmmh that Saxophone
[1:27:35] <Halospaz117> Fuck
[1:27:39] <$Xisalex> FIRST TERMINAL: Mised.
[1:27:39] <TheChucklingOak> The sax is jazz as all heck
[1:27:39] <+SpcOpsBear> Mmmm, yes that sax.
[1:27:41] <dinnydanny777> It's great but it's not jazz
[1:27:43] <%a_goth_pancake> sirens mean secrets
[1:27:45] <Halospaz117> Yep, they missed it
[1:27:45] <%RioGascar> The ai is guiding you, ITS SOOO FUCKING GOOD
[1:27:46] <Sora9567> Shame that the SMG and more or less all automatic bullet weapons are worthless on Heroic and above.
[1:27:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:27:47] <%threeheadedwalrus> this bit is kind of jazz
[1:27:48] <@Menitta> ya like jazz

[1:27:57] <derap41> its not Jazz....yet
[1:27:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie loved the urban stuff in 2, this game is all urban
[1:27:58] <yusefHD> Sexiest instrument is a bissoon.

[1:28:32] <+condemned_15> No
[1:28:32] <$Xisalex> NO
[1:28:32] <Halospaz117> @RioGascar That's cuz the ai guides you to the terminals, not the goals
[1:28:35] <+RedKazoo> a Theremin is super sexy
[1:28:36] <%slimmixrp> NOOOOOO

[1:28:50] <Nomad94> Chat...
[1:28:51] <%D00msDayDan> don't worry guys, the good samaritan achievement isn't in MCC
[1:28:53] <%RioGascar> last i checked at least
[1:28:56] <$Xisalex> Don't shoot the squid-bois!
[1:28:59] <fearhurst> click click, my blaster jammed
[1:29:03] <+classical_gomez> IT STILL HURTS
[1:29:03] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:29:04] <RoldanDgr8> pretty sure the music would be better catogorized as jazz fusion
[1:29:05] <subjectg> urban warfare is a hellish place
[1:29:06] <Sora9567> Also Chat. Shush about the thing
[1:29:08] <Nomad94> it literally doesn't matter, chat
[1:29:12] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus USE PISTOL
[1:29:16] <stormhawk9891> SHUT UP CHAT
[1:29:18] <+BurkeBigsby> Just go around atpTopSpeed
[1:29:19] <Sora9567> He mustn't know yet.
[1:29:21] <Halospaz117> I mean it's still mean
[1:29:23] <brachydios777> t101Oof
[1:29:26] <Joestar1890> Chat seems to be SUPER sympathetic for an alien we know NOTHING ABOUT
[1:29:29] <%mitchteck> NO NOT THE GOOD BOYS
[1:29:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> pew pew
[1:29:33] <+Avossk_> RIP squid buddy
[1:29:34] <$Xisalex> Poor guy...

[1:29:41] <+wunp_fxs> shush chat
[1:29:41] <phantalime> noooo how dare you
[1:29:45] <%TheEpicTree> T_T
[1:29:47] <Sora9567> Stop trying to inadvertantly spoil Woolie on the thing.
[1:29:48] <%a_goth_pancake> maybe if he got the audio logs...
[1:29:53] <$TyroneRugen> haha spiky alien go boom
[1:29:55] <thebalticguy1> woolie pistol fires faster than that
[1:29:56] <razieltano123> Halo did it before doom eternal.
[1:29:56] <%hattrick61> If it's any consolation it explodes when the brutes die anyway
[1:29:58] <+BurkeBigsby> Can;t the pistol be mashed?
[1:30:01] <Sora9567> Correct.
[1:30:08] <+SpcOpsBear> In order to kill the Covenant, you must defeat me, an extremely passive-aggressive Squid-John Romero-Squid.
[1:30:09] <Sora9567> It has a very high fire rate.
[1:30:14] <%a_goth_pancake> so you don't kill the brutes
[1:30:14] <subjectg> you really don’t want to use the pistol on shields anyhow
[1:30:16] <black_pariah> chat blew up the same the last time this happened. Guys its not going to get better LuL
[1:30:18] <%RyTYoung> Good Butcher impersonation LUL
[1:30:19] <+kinmarik> It's semi auto tap it faster
[1:30:20] <%RioGascar> uses a previous reference that took the idea from this game for later use...hurts
[1:30:21] <+LolLoki> audio logs become available now, right?
[1:30:27] <Sora9567> Correct.
[1:30:28] <%D00msDayDan> @lolloki doesn't matter
[1:30:34] <%a_goth_pancake> almost like the street sections encourage stealth gsmeplayt
[1:30:35] <+Avossk_> This game doesnt have weapon bloom like in reach so rapid fire doesnt punish your accuracy
[1:30:35] <%Javaa01> @BurkeBigsby You can spam the pistol, but frankly, that's a waste of ammo
[1:30:35] <+DukeAtomic> @lolloki Yeah but they're not worth collecting this early
[1:30:42] <%D00msDayDan> they're not going to collect all the audio logs during the LP
[1:30:43] <dinnydanny777> You are killing dozens of Covenant who are both twice your size tho, that's still pretty badass
[1:30:46] <%Solidnick18> SourPks
[1:30:47] <sapphire475gs> Audio logs are available for any Mombasa Street episode (except the last one).
[1:30:47] <mehfromBL> i dont hat they're talking about with not feeling as strong as the chief. they are very much the same
[1:30:48] <nintega010> I liked that you need health packs in this game
[1:30:53] <Joestar1890> SourPls
[1:30:54] <+yhom_tork> SourPls
[1:31:04] <+Mondeiya> certain logs give you weapon cache's at least
[1:31:06] <subjectg> I love these covie gank squads they send your way if you keep killing aliens
[1:31:07] <%Cerberus_NV> SourPls
[1:31:07] <Sora9567> A NEW BREED OF STEALTH
[1:31:09] <iamtheTwitchghost> SourPls
[1:31:09] <Ynkubus_> Stealth is optional
[1:31:09] <+TheotherKristian> Oh THAT MUSIC THO
[1:31:11] <fearhurst> short range weapon acquired
[1:31:15] <thebalticguy1> Woolie will never hold a precison weapon
[1:31:17] <+kinmarik> It's the Tekken 4 of halo
[1:31:19] <dinnydanny777> Those drums tho
[1:31:22] <IndoorSitup> Man, why does Woolie hate precision weapons??
[1:31:35] <infernalram> i've never heard these drums?
[1:31:36] <%a_goth_pancake> bye carbine, I'm sure you wouldn't have helped that much...
[1:31:36] <mehfromBL> is woolie an ork?
[1:31:38] <dinnydanny777> The build up to this part sounds like Twister from TWEWY
[1:31:49] <dinnydanny777> I was trying to work out what it sounded like
[1:31:59] <+DukeAtomic> Follow the cars
[1:32:01] <yeildingthought> @indoorsitup the spread is too wide Kappa
[1:32:03] <critfumble_> its a shame because the carbine fucks in this game its super strong
[1:32:06] <DSD24> @dinnydanny777 Oh wow I hear it
[1:32:07] <TheChucklingOak> Parts of this game sound like Jak and Daxter, like the foresty sections I think? Anyone know what I mean?
[1:32:17] <+yhom_tork> SourPls
[1:32:20] <chainsaw105> roughly 2 weeks
[1:32:23] <%RioGascar> At least the city doesn’t feel copy paste
[1:32:23] <Halospaz117> THEY ARE SO CLOSE
[1:32:30] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Use precision weapons against Grunts and Jackals.
[1:32:31] <TheChucklingOak> Right there! that bit sounded like Jak and Daxter
[1:32:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah like a week I think? Im not sure
[1:32:35] <+Pop_O_Matic> ODST is basically the apology for Halo 2 and 3 not being the big "save da earf" games they were initially promoted as.
[1:32:37] <coreyyotto> SingsNote Fighting in the city SingsNote
[1:32:40] <%Isphone555> It's no City of Glass from mirror's edge, but it'll do.
[1:32:42] <Halospaz117> YES YOU CAN
[1:32:51] <Explodincatz> @TheChucklingOak for me it sounds like an Outer Wilds song
[1:32:54] <+DukeAtomic> PLEASE WALK not LOCKED
[1:32:55] <%a_goth_pancake> door
[1:32:57] <Dynamo_Commando> probably the rooftop, those jackal snipers still kick ass
[1:32:59] <+TheotherKristian> Oh geez I think I went through this whole game without ever checking my map that I didn't know existed
[1:33:01] <sapphire475gs> All that noise you are hearing from the street is an audio log location.

[1:57:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:57:13] <sapphire475gs> OH, I just noticed. Ammo counter is bottom right for ODST, so Woolie might have a better time tracking his ammo.

[2:46:00] <derap41> How long until Woolie starts streaming Arma
[2:46:00] <brachydios777> dtchatMartin
[2:46:14] <%RioGascar> arma, litterally never
[2:46:16] <%RioGascar> ever
[2:46:17] <rsg220> we got unhappy park goers in sector 3, HYUCK
[2:46:22] <$serpenttucker> OH shit ha is an elephant
[2:46:26] <%chiluzza> the Moussen SS as my dad calls them
[2:46:26] <FunkyWaters> mickey mouse riot police with the gas masks
[2:46:26] <tearfuldevil> thats a fever dream lol
[2:46:28] <+Walopoh> Disney Shock Troopers
[2:46:39] <DeepSearch27> Orbital Disney Shock Troopers?
[2:46:42] <+IntrepidEye> Arma is about as far from something Woolie would play as you can get
[2:46:46] <Joestar1890> RIP that Elite
[2:46:47] <+Pyroclase> IIRC a space elevator could wrap around the world twice over, according to some designs
[2:46:51] <subjectg> Now imagine security officers going “RESISTANCE IS FUTILE” in the donald duck voice
[2:46:54] <+YabbaTroll> Guys I just remembered, there is a Vergil in this game.
[2:46:58] <+Pyroclase> you REALLY want it to break at the bottom so it just flies off into space
[2:46:59] <Jessie_Lockhart> The Disney riot troops would just be the mascots with body armor underneath the fuzz
[2:46:59] <rsg220> he kept the pistol, praise be to Y
[2:47:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Jessie_Lockhart now we just need George Lucas to Throw disney off into a bottomless pit
[2:47:05] <dinnydanny777> Now how will I replay Kingdom Hearts 2's Mulan world :(
[2:47:07] <derap41> @IntrepidEye Which is why he would ultimate fake out
[2:47:14] <FunkyWaters> tactical fursuits
[2:47:23] <$serpenttucker> this is the first time woolie will get to see the elephant in acion
[2:47:25] <Depthcharge2030> oh wait.....i remember this encounter
[2:47:27] <Jessie_Lockhart> @melchior_the_wise doodGood
[2:47:28] <saddlezilla1> the crazy thing is a space elevator would part way collapse but half would stay in orbit?
[2:47:41] <Jessie_Lockhart> He’d throw Mickey off tho
[2:47:43] <slix3431> Woolie ZOOM!
[2:47:44] <Joestar1890> HUNTERS
[2:47:47] <+smikeye> wouldn't be high enough or have enough speed to maintain an orbit
[2:48:02] <brachydios777> Now he’s getting it
[2:48:05] <thebalticguy1> wasting ammo
[2:48:05] <Joestar1890> I hated this section
[2:48:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> hell yeah
[2:48:16] <$raven_frame> Use them fire grenades.
[2:48:24] <Dynamo_Commando> could a space elevator theoretically work?
[2:48:27] <FunkyWaters> stick em
[2:48:27] <+smikeye> they're hunters, you just keep pumping ammo into the front, right? that's how they die?
[2:48:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> Make hunters scary
[2:48:35] <%RioGascar> theoretically yes
[2:48:37] <Second_Omega> It’s a shame they don’t have any saferooms
[2:48:47] <iamtheTwitchghost> PHYSICS
[2:48:49] <%RioGascar> but we'd need a shit ton of materials
[2:48:50] <%TheEpicTree> LUL
[2:48:51] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Dynamo_Commando they can, we just don't have a material strong enough to handle the tensile forces
[2:48:52] <+gitgouda> that pistol sounds like a plasma pistol.
[2:48:54] <FunkyWaters> use grenadas
[2:48:54] <%DomunDomunDomun> @Dynamo_Commando I think the main problem is finding materials strong enough.
[2:48:54] <+Walopoh> You thought LUL
[2:48:57] <%LordSDB> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:49:00] <CuteFlutterSpy> hunter said fuck that box
[2:49:06] <black_pariah> 4 games and he still cant do the hunter dance
[2:49:06] <sapphire475gs> Imagine Woolie playing alone.
[2:49:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dynamo_commando You need something like carbon nanotubes that have absurd tensile strength, manufactured in bulk.
[2:49:07] <thebalticguy1> shoot them in the bac
[2:49:12] <brachydios777> Gotem
[2:49:20] <+condemned_15> gut shots never hurt the hunters
[2:49:27] <%alpacasintophats> perhaps finding terminals may improve your situation?
[2:49:33] <%Javaa01> They do not have shields, they do not give a single shit about the plasma pistol
[2:49:36] <%RioGascar> we could make a space elevator but also peopel would scream thats its a waste of money
[2:49:40] <+smikeye> how long ago did they start?
[2:49:42] <+mundanelotus> which level is this?
[2:49:51] <Melchior_the_Wise> @Dynamo_Commando and the materials exist, but can't be manufactured in a scale large enough or woven in such a way that would allow the distances necessary (22,000miles)
[2:50:12] <CuteFlutterSpy> @smikeye 3 hours
[2:50:15] <%RioGascar> space travel is nothing but a massive waste of money Kappa
[2:50:16] <$serpenttucker> the balance of halo 2 and 3 has always been Bullets= good against flesh, plasma = good against shields

[2:50:41] <saddlezilla1> anyone see that chimp pic posted on the sub?
[2:50:42] <+MrAtheGreat> Too late, the monkes are already with the Covenant

[2:51:08] <+TheIntellectional> joe rogan, head of ONI's chimp R&D department
[2:51:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> @dinnydanny777 carbon nanotubes are a better contender, but CNTs are a derivitive of graphene.
[2:51:15] <subjectg> what is stealth
[2:51:28] <+Grayhammatter> how do i stealth?
[2:51:35] <FunkyWaters> beep
[2:51:36] <Dynamo_Commando> I appreciate these responses about the space elevator.
[2:51:37] <+Pyroclase> BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
[2:51:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> CNTs are just graphene sheets roled int tubes
[2:51:40] <BlackermanZX> beep doodDerp
[2:51:46] <saddlezilla1> to quote the sub "if chimps trained they'd just do Roundtrip's w/ your severed arm"
[2:51:48] <Melchior_the_Wise> into
[2:51:52] <+smikeye> there isnt' really stealth in this game, soon as you shoot an enemy with your silenced pistol everyone knows where you are

[2:52:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @SirGO0SE I SAW HIM VENT
[2:52:14] <GodlyLuigi> the only real stealth is outright avoiding encounters

[2:58:06] <slix3431> Woolie makes his own difficulty
[2:58:09] <subjectg> @sora9567 not like eyes can just improve naturally, yeah?
[2:58:11] <bearwagon> did that brute kill himself
[2:58:17] <Sora9567> Fair.
[2:58:22] <+condemned_15> But it blows out the screen and makes the LP look like shit
[2:58:32] <%RioGascar> it is just halo 3 reskinned honestly
[2:58:32] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> There will be a new tank if you want to loose damaged one

[3:09:05] <$drabberfaun535> woolie stole V's team kill
[3:09:07] <RealPT1> RIP that guy
[3:09:09] <%marrs_bars> that grunt saw some shit
[3:09:18] <thatsocrunchy> Their sacrifices were for the greater good
[3:09:18] <slix3431> Ditch the tank he says
[3:09:19] <+Buzzkill983> Murdered that man for no reason
[3:09:21] <FunkyWaters> blood sacrifice failed to move the tank
[3:09:32] <slix3431> Woolie is like: "Who the hell do you think I am?"
[3:09:36] <%SirGO0SE> Halo Door Dash edition would be a good sponsorship
[3:09:36] <AsHeadsIsTails> Tank does NOT beat wall
[3:09:37] <$drabberfaun535> time to see 24 wiffs
[3:09:40] <miguel6671> the tank need more blood
[3:09:58] <+TheIntellectional> All the soldiers will look up and shout "GET OUT THE TANK", and I'll look down and whisper "no"
[3:10:03] <lonefirewarrior> The rookie is going to be very confused about that tank in a few hours.
[3:10:07] <ralphfromdk> A tank would be great right about now
[3:10:13] <Wan6Saber> or beat up the Wraith....
[3:10:17] <thebalticguy1> woolie sniping grunts again
[3:10:23] <Sora9567> That's how The Rookie knew Mickey was there.
[3:10:24] <slix3431> Rookie should discover too wraiths fucking and deduce woolie was there

[3:15:21] <CuteFlutterSpy> nice ses
[3:15:21] <Second_Omega> Good sesh
[3:15:22] <%RioGascar> sniper shooting in the background
[3:15:22] <%Lion_kun> short session but it's not a long game
[3:15:23] <$jake5713> Dope.
[3:15:27] <The_Swedish_X> hope this isn't too much of a mess for Mihn
[3:15:29] <Jessie_Lockhart> Tank parkour was easily the highlight
[3:15:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> Good camera shift
[3:15:31] <sapphire475gs> And that's a wrap. It's fun, indeed.
[3:15:34] <%RioGascar> i missed most the start due to class, but good session
[3:15:37] <%SirGO0SE> woolie love halo :)
[3:15:40] <+kinmarik> how ya liking tekken 4
[3:15:45] <Artoo_The_Me> NOOOO I JUST FINISHED MY WORK
[3:15:48] <Artoo_The_Me> NOOOOOOO
[3:15:49] <brachydios777> This game will probably be 2 or 3 sessions
[3:15:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Artoo_The_Me F
[3:16:01] <Halospaz117> Be careful with the donation reads, some asshole did BIG SPOILERS
[3:16:02] <Artoo_The_Me> Eh VOD BOIS TIME
[3:16:07] <%Theycallmenerf> Can’t wait to watch the VOD!
[3:16:09] <DeepSearch27> @Artoo_The_Me F
[3:16:11] <%RioGascar> i feel they didnt do enough to make you feel "weaker"
[3:16:11] <DigitalJoshie> dat was some good ODST-ing
[3:16:16] <%RioGascar> but they cant do too much
[3:16:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Halospaz117 they have been warned
[3:16:18] <Jessie_Lockhart> Also not exactly a named character
[3:16:22] <Halospaz117> ok good
[3:16:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Some Dude is the COOLEST
[3:16:33] <Jessie_Lockhart> Just unnamed soldier man
[3:16:42] <%RioGascar> like okay remove vehcile flipping...now what if the player REQUIRES a vehcile
[3:16:45] <%Theycallmenerf> Rookie is AWESOME
[3:16:55] <brachydios777> The Rookie is the most some dude character in Halo
[3:16:59] <%SirGO0SE> at the time iirc people werent too jazzed to not play as chief, but isnt that always the case
[3:16:59] <omicronalpharius> I feel like Master Chief is more like Sherman burning down Georgia.
[3:17:03] <%RioGascar> you cant remove it but it makes you feel like nothing different
[3:17:20] <Jessie_Lockhart> Imagine if Rookie was Master Chief all along
[3:17:22] <Explodincatz> i miss the motion tracker
[3:17:31] <%RyTYoung> The city areas are fine w/o sprint
[3:17:32] <+Grayhammatter> except for the night vision during the day, it was good
[3:17:33] <@Menitta> Sprint was good
[3:17:35] <$raven_frame> I do not, sprint can get bent.
[3:17:36] <%RioGascar> reach was the project most of bungies staff was working on during odst dev
[3:17:38] <%Theycallmenerf> I’m gonna keep it clean but I’m very interested with Woolie’s thoughts on ODST when we come to the conclusion.
[3:17:40] <+Mondeiya> joe odst is a sax god
[3:17:43] <+Msytic6> He LOVES sprint chat Kappa
[3:17:48] <brachydios777> You are some autobot grunt while Chief is Optimius Prime

[3:18:07] <%SirGO0SE> itd be great if a Spartan came along and NTR'd your gun
[3:18:07] <DigitalJoshie> odst was suppose to be DLC for halo 3, but bungie switch it to be a full release, thats why islts so similar to halo 3

[3:19:31] <+Fenrein> I won't rain on other people liking sprint. I just won't play Halo games with sprint in them
[3:19:39] <dinnydanny777> No, don't put sprint in Halo, Master Chief must arrive everywhere by powerwalking Kappa
[3:19:46] <+Catpurrple> I just wish sprint was a latent thing, I hate having to wegh armor abilities because sprint is never as useful as other shit.

[3:20:30] <Jessie_Lockhart> Fight is finished when you are
[3:20:33] <%D00msDayDan> wish people would shut the fuck up about project orion already
[3:20:34] <+jiggy_snipe> I think they just meant in general after the One Guy
[3:20:35] <tearfuldevil> apperently he was chronic spoily
[3:20:38] <DatAsuna> donos have dropped that before
[3:20:40] <FunkyWaters> you finish one fight and ten others pop up
[3:20:41] <+Catpurrple> @hayasage I never knew that, cool
[3:20:45] <+Stupid121v2> Halo campaign is cool with sprint, online isn’t as cool. There’s not much else to talk about with it honestly lol
[3:20:46] <+Msytic6> D:
[3:20:49] <black_pariah> that was probably a contextual comment
[3:20:50] <MajoraZ> Yes,orion
[3:20:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:20:52] <Joestar1890> RIP Johnson
[3:20:52] <DatAsuna> it wasn't remembered, makes you wonder why chat bothers
[3:21:04] <+mundanelotus> But he is a dude
[3:21:05] <+jiggy_snipe> I agree
[3:21:07] <huskarl_zap> It was added post 343
[3:21:07] <%RioGascar> it was only supplemntal material
[3:21:07] <BlackermanZX> Johnson doodSad
[3:21:10] <chainsaw105> good thing you can ignore it!
[3:21:12] <%StryderStrikesAt> Just rolled in for the last level, are they doing the audio logs?
[3:21:12] <%RioGascar> so in game he actually is just a dude
[3:21:13] <MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus S1's are barely stronger then normal so it's still fine
[3:21:13] <DigitalJoshie> he still is a dude tho
[3:21:15] <+dr1ove> halo gaiden let's start it ItsHappening
[3:21:15] <Sora9567> Me neither. I liked First Strike's explanation.
[3:21:15] <Jessie_Lockhart> Not everyone has to be super
[3:21:17] <+NeonTurnip> iirc johnson also served as an ODST at some point i may be wrong tho
[3:21:19] <Halospaz117> It was retroactively called Spartan 1 after the Spartan 2 project began
[3:21:23] <%MrBrainSlug> I've been waiting for 30 mins to say... You both rock! Keep kicking butt Woolie and LittleV!
[3:21:26] <+mr_drucifer> Hola Woolie and V! Hope you're having a good day today. Both of your shirts are dope!
[3:21:31] <+Fenrein> 343 loves adding unnecessary lore
[3:21:35] <DatAsuna> GMOs :o
[3:21:36] <Jessie_Lockhart> Character is often better established when you’re not super powered
[3:21:38] <dinnydanny777> It means child soldiers Kappa
[3:21:40] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @brachydios777
[3:21:42] <Halospaz117> Yeah I'm mixed on the Johnson is an S1 thing
[3:21:42] <+Stupid121v2> Wasn’t the “it’s classified” info from halo 2 like REALLY goofy for Johnson lol?
[3:21:45] <%doomerskeletor13> @hayasage That wasn’t 343 lmao
[3:21:46] <tearfuldevil> also it jsut hurts our eyes
[3:21:49] <%D00msDayDan> @Hayasage project orion was introduced between halo 1 and 2 lmao
[3:21:49] <+TheIntellectional> the only thing he really does thats pushing dude territory is surviving the flood in CE
[3:21:51] <tearfuldevil> some of us
[3:21:52] <%RioGascar> @Hayasage ...that wasnt 343...that was bungie that added that lore
[3:21:55] <+condemned_15> Use your eyes
[3:21:59] <%RioGascar> in supplemental material
[3:22:03] <Joestar1890> Yeah, but you don't need it during the day
[3:22:06] <+Fenrein> Aight I was proven wrong.
[3:22:08] <BlackermanZX> shoot first and ask questions later
[3:22:10] <+cursedwithadhd> you shot friendlies in broad daylight
[3:22:10] <subjectg> they’re aliens for a reason babe
[3:22:20] <subjectg> they’re meant to be easy to ID
[3:22:23] <huskarl_zap> well its new to me
[3:22:29] <%MrBrainSlug> Will you be playing Halo 4 in the future... you don't need to...
[3:22:31] <+jiggy_snipe> get a bigger TV Woolie Kappa
[3:22:37] <+Fenrein> I'll admit my bias against 343 is pretty unfair lol
[3:22:40] <+jiggy_snipe> big ol 90 inch
[3:22:42] <iheatthis12> get bigger eyes
[3:22:42] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s always funny when I hear people complaining about 343 adding lore that Bungie actually did... it happens way more than you’d think
[3:22:43] <+condemned_15> The footage of the day levels are completely blown out
[3:22:47] <dinnydanny777> Halo 4 isn't bad
[3:22:54] <DatAsuna> oni are bastards, that's all
[3:22:56] <Jessie_Lockhart> Just sit 2 feet from it like we did as kids watching cartoons
[3:22:58] <dinnydanny777> It's not as good, but it isn't bad
[3:23:07] <DPmusique> I disagree
[3:23:08] <prime_name> Dating a government person must suck
[3:23:13] <puluxor> But what about the difference between Spartan IIs and IIIs?
[3:23:28] <%MrBrainSlug> Halo 4 isn't that good either

[3:27:41] <DatAsuna> like bethesda games
[3:27:42] <%Theycallmenerf> What counts as Buttrock
[3:27:44] <Jessie_Lockhart> Most people dont want something complex. They like something they can jump into and understand pretty quickly.
[3:27:49] <+TheIntellectional> most people like pop music and a preferred niche, depends on whether you're in the mood to engage or not
[3:27:51] <%SirGO0SE> @Menitta Kreygasm
[3:27:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:27:52] <SailorJagen> oh no a cough woolly got rona

[3:28:06] <%Mr_Strut> I just want more keygen chiptunes

[3:28:18] <prime_name> What's Acid Jazz?
[3:28:18] <Chatterbox1991> i recently got introduced to Brazilian Funk
[3:28:21] <%Reverend_Roscoe> yeah, whatever the hell Mick Gordon does
[3:28:23] <brachydios777> Acid Jazz?

[3:28:38] <Yummy_Nukes> bluegrass
[3:28:45] <Jessie_Lockhart> They’d never want it, but I wish Machinae Supremacy was a little more well known.
[3:28:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> lil v bumping that d'angelo in the car?
[3:28:48] <$d00med_magus> @black_pariah second question does the d stand for darlington

[3:28:56] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @second_omega i second
[3:28:57] <+DesertPenguin> Yea R&B as in Rhythm and Blues, not "R&B"
[3:29:03] <subjectg> More 90s yugoslavian rock would be nice
[3:29:04] <Explodincatz> Left 4 Halo?
[3:29:12] <+DesertPenguin> Conscious Hip-Hop? You mean lyrically dense Hip-Hop?
[3:29:12] <%doomerskeletor13> I’d love a horror game in the Halo universe
[3:29:12] <+Stupid121v2> Wonder if Woolie would like JPEGmafia lol
[3:29:12] <+Estuko> That'd be a REALLY fun survivor mode if anything
[3:29:14] <prime_name> Flood aren't gear for horror
[3:29:15] <+lazymoon1> !uptime
[3:29:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 40 minutes
[3:29:18] <chainsaw105> they're more gross than scary
[3:29:22] <+mundanelotus> Are they done for today?
[3:29:22] <%MrBrainSlug> Head Crabs are scarier
[3:29:25] <%RioGascar> the flood in game are goofy
[3:29:27] <Joestar1890> Idk, Keyes Terminal was pretty messed up
[3:29:32] <saddlezilla1> Flood are way scarier in the books and lore than the games.
[3:29:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jessie_lockhart I know one of their songs, and it's rad
[3:29:34] <%RioGascar> the flood in fiction tho are terrifying
[3:29:36] <DigitalJoshie> their more horrifying in their lore and implications
[3:29:37] <black_pariah> they meant to engender tension rather than fear
[3:29:43] <SaltyShots> they're aren't scary because you are the most competent soldier ever
[3:29:45] <saddlezilla1> also it was 2001
[3:29:46] <maxpasta> They aren’t scary because how easy they are to kill
[3:29:46] <dinnydanny777> Can we get more pop music that's like whatever Numa Numa was
[3:29:47] <Jessie_Lockhart> Flood are conceptually scary. What they are capable as opposed to the visual shock value.
[3:29:54] <dinnydanny777> Is Numa Numa Eurobeat?
[3:29:55] <%doomerskeletor13> If you wanted to do a horror game in the Halo universe I think you’d need to introduce a new enemy or play as a civilian
[3:29:55] <%RioGascar> like halo 2 flood can drive warhogs
[3:29:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> violins monkaS
[3:29:56] <DigitalJoshie> in terms of the games, not really
[3:29:56] <+TheIntellectional> the flood ambience is kinda spooky
[3:29:59] <+Walopoh> BIG threat
[3:30:00] <%RioGascar> and it looks STUPID
[3:30:15] <%JustYudha> Lol

[3:30:28] <+Catpurrple> I mean as soon as you're used to anything, fear's gone. Dead Space was scary the first time, and never again.

[3:31:48] <alrobot2014> english is a fuck
[3:31:53] <%krispen_wa> Woolie just read an Elder Scroll
[3:32:05] <%Theycallmenerf> World is a Reach
[3:32:08] <%RioGascar> okay: odst the troppers in halo 2. without those 2 we would not have halo 3: odst
[3:32:09] <Halospaz117> We gotta do parentheses now
[3:32:10] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGIRLS
[3:32:17] <Halospaz117> ODSTs are called Helljumpers
[3:32:22] <black_pariah> feet first into hell
[3:32:38] <brachydios777> Bungie was working on Destiny for a while
[3:32:42] <alrobot2014> pretty sure they even had the destiny logos
[3:32:47] <maxpasta> Remember when ODST was called Halo:Recon
[3:32:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> DO IT FOR HER *picture of Earth*
[3:32:53] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ah, did i miss the stream?
[3:32:56] <+condemned_15> Activision a fuck
[3:32:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> Retroactive infringement
[3:32:58] <%RioGascar> in the time we had NO clue it was even destiny
[3:32:59] <+Stupid121v2> Wait is that gone now in ODST?
[3:33:01] <+Stupid121v2> Makes sense
[3:33:02] <+mundanelotus> no one
[3:33:03] <+DukeAtomic> Bungie is with nobody now
[3:33:05] <+jiggy_snipe> no one
[3:33:07] <+jiggy_snipe> self ownedd
[3:33:07] <%RioGascar> bungie is indie now
[3:33:07] <%MrBrainSlug> Halo 3: Recon
[3:33:09] <Visorak6> Bungie is independent now
[3:33:09] <Halospaz117> It's Bungie's game, not 343's
[3:33:09] <thebalticguy1> Recently split with activision
[3:33:09] <brachydios777> Because of Activison probably
[3:33:10] <+Reaviar> theyre independent now
[3:33:10] <prime_name> Not anymore?
[3:33:10] <%afronooch> bungie by themselves
[3:33:11] <Joestar1890> Bungie is independent\
[3:33:12] <$silentblast93> bungie is independent
[3:33:12] <Hammatime8> Bungie is flying solo now
[3:33:16] <+jiggy_snipe> yes
[3:33:16] <Visorak6> Yes
[3:33:17] <+Fenrein> Bungie was with Activision until recently
[3:33:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> They don't take chances
[3:33:17] <thebalticguy1> yes
[3:33:18] <+Stupid121v2> Yeah
[3:33:18] <redrins> they split from actiblizz
[3:33:18] <%afronooch> probably
[3:33:18] <Jessie_Lockhart> They are separate now
[3:33:18] <+JeluxDaCasual> THAT IS TRUE
[3:33:21] <DemonicHoward> activision
[3:33:22] <EldritchNeko> Woolie gave me a hug at pax east once and it was a super good hug love both you guys!!
[3:33:23] <%Tearonex> @WoolieVersus They left activision
[3:33:24] <+Grayhammatter> activision
[3:33:24] <%Theycallmenerf> Bungie got their publishing rights for Destiny
[3:33:25] <+Msytic6> Not anymore
[3:33:26] <subjectg> much of bungie’s old guard is gone though
[3:33:26] <Jessie_Lockhart> They left Activision
[3:33:27] <Hammatime8> V is right
[3:33:27] <brachydios777> well now Bungie is independent
[3:33:31] <DigitalJoshie> their solo
[3:33:31] <+Fenrein> Activision Blizzard
[3:33:34] <huskarl_zap> blizzard still ride activision cock
[3:33:35] <%MrBrainSlug> Bungie is it's own thing now
[3:33:39] <DigitalJoshie> no it was an ugly break up
[3:33:39] <alrobot2014> they were with actiblizz then fucked off and took their games with them
[3:33:39] <phantalime> bungie WAS with Activision back when MCC came out, now they're alone, point is MS doesnt have rights to Destiny
[3:33:40] <+Stupid121v2> TEN YEAR PLAN
[3:33:43] <%alpacasintophats> bungie bought itself back
[3:33:45] <chainsaw105> Bungie was with Activision until January last year
[3:33:50] <+DukeAtomic> You got it about right
[3:33:51] <+mundanelotus> They left on their own I believe
[3:33:51] <%Theycallmenerf> (TEN YEAR PLAN)
[3:33:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> blame bobby
[3:33:55] <+Haildrops> My brother-in-law that worked at Activision said that Activision dropped them because they were too expensive to keep. It 's like a thousand person studio that really wasn't making much money.
[3:33:57] <BearSawed> Bungo bought out the ip
[3:33:57] <%afronooch> thats prety much right yeah
[3:33:58] <Jessie_Lockhart> Fucking Activision
[3:34:00] <%SirGO0SE> its bigger than overwatch but both games suck LUL
[3:34:04] <DigitalJoshie> but bungie who made halo is effectively dead tho
[3:34:05] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> It’s all good V
[3:34:05] <Joestar1890> Yes
[3:34:07] <LiloAndStitchIceCreamGuy> alan tudyk
[3:34:09] <%superc37> probably
[3:34:11] <Joestar1890> Mickey is Wash
[3:34:14] <+condemned_15> Mickey - Alan Tudyk
[3:34:15] <%MrBrainSlug> Dainiel Baldwin
[3:34:15] <thebalticguy1> Wash
[3:34:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Alan Tudyk
[3:34:17] <+cursedwithadhd> all male squad mates
[3:34:19] <+JeluxDaCasual> Mickey
[3:34:21] <thebalticguy1> Mickey
[3:34:21] <subjectg> Mickey is Alan Tudyk
[3:34:23] <DigitalJoshie> most of the halo people don't work at bungie anymore
[3:34:26] <Yummy_Nukes> squad is firefly
[3:34:26] <%Theycallmenerf> Alan Tudyk is Mickey!!?
[3:34:31] <%RioGascar> so better wording: with halo 2 the odst's that showed up in game were originally not going to be in the game. but 2 leads at bungie argued for their inclusion. without those 2 leads we would not have halo 3: odst (most likely)
[3:34:35] <thebalticguy1> Dutch is adam baldwin
[3:34:37] <+JeluxDaCasual> and Dare is Six from Battlestar of Course
[3:34:50] <DemonicHoward> see ya next week V
