[1:01:05] <Belakitu> The board zays the points
[1:01:07] <Club_Sodar> stick or pad are both pretty good, stick might give you better control since the whole game revolves around fireball motions for throws
[1:01:10] <AppleBerryKitty> it shows the points all over the map
[1:01:19] <Club_Sodar> also hurts your hand less
[1:01:30] <RorBoy> this volley tho

[1:11:16] <%RemedyofRevenge> Note about defending dunks, you can grab the disc by jumping but also intercept from the ground.  Which means they can't really throw it OVER your body, only past you on either side.  Useful for positioning so you can catch all angles before it settles on the ground.
[1:12:08] <abbock> dunks are so risky. if it's returned by a slapshot, the dunker won't even get to land and catch it
[1:12:20] <abbock> really tempting on 4 point miss arenas though

[1:16:10] <leith_aziz> pickyPalm
[1:16:23] <+Chronor655> Where was its origin?
[1:16:31] <PFlare> I thought the origin WAS Divekick?
[1:16:41] <%dds333a> A fraud in FGC terms is somebody who doesnt take a single round
[1:16:46] <%RemedyofRevenge> Note about defending dunks, you can grab the disc by jumping but also intercept from the ground.  Which means they can't really throw it OVER your body, only past you on either side.  Useful for positioning so you can catch all angles before it settles on the ground. @WoolieVersus

[1:52:42] <%Naedtgio> Naedtgio subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:52:43] <mrtanaka111> stream over?
[1:52:45] <AppleBerryKitty> mostly only popular ins france if I recall. I don't get why games like this and lethal league die out fast.
[1:52:48] <a_mad_dragon_> so dotemu can't emulate for shit but they can actually make good original stuff
[1:52:52] <Calek> @2thre3 just windjammers 2
[1:52:52] <@Menitta> Disk Jam was the one I remember
[1:52:57] <$ggbhtg> next is mahvel
[1:53:01] <GeltonZ> @alphalejandro Hence why we got a sequel! G-Mode will give out Data East licenses for a song.
[1:53:06] <mrtanaka111> mahvel 3

[1:53:19] <+Byr0nX> you "see" the angles
[1:53:25] <GeltonZ> @AppleBerryKitty And then it was a French dev that made the sequel!
[1:53:27] <fluke_LKZ> For those who just got it, KowtowRobinson on twitter made a tutorial thread that's 100% better than the game's
[1:53:33] <+CAPSLOCKlive> the matches dont drag either, it's easy to get in and get it done.
[1:53:35] <%RyTYoung> @tungstenviper holy shit I’ve never seen that before! Seems pretty cool for the time
[1:53:47] <AppleBerryKitty> oh, well there you go.
[1:53:49] <mrtanaka111> whats up with game devs and bad tutorials
[1:54:09] <@Menitta> ooooh that sounds fun
[1:55:00] <%TungstenViper> @RyTYoung it radiates extreme Edgy sport from the mid 00s and the budget was definitely low, but yeah it was an interesting game

[2:12:12] <skagtheprinceofhell> So is there a reason mods are on certian characters?
[2:12:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> Wait so I kinda missed the intro and no little about MVC3 in general, are these just costume mods or actual different character mods?

[2:13:07] <leith_aziz> pickyVibing pickyVibing pickyVibing
[2:13:21] <%dds333a> For example, Shadow Lady was already a color back in MVC3, but this made it into a separate "EX" character
[2:13:26] <$ggbhtg> I hear Heroes and Heralds is a big resource for character movessets, but I know LITERALLY NOTHING about that mode
[2:13:26] <mrtanaka111> look at all this NFTS

[2:14:32] <357Sneak> this looks sooooooo COOL
[2:14:32] <voodoolawyer> MARVEL 3??
[2:14:35] <%dds333a> Heroes and heralds was a big around the world style mode where you fight several increasingly more difficult teams,,using card to augment your own team
[2:14:41] <ToastyBroDude> MAHVEL IS RIGHT NOW
[2:14:48] <leith_aziz> pickyFocus
[2:15:00] <%dds333a> It's like Gem Fighters in terms of customization, kinda

[2:15:09] <@Menitta> Playing Legends right now, it's awesome Tron Bonne was in MVCI
[2:15:11] <voodoolawyer> Scarlet Spider ... damn how easy would it be to throw Miles into this

[2:15:42] <+TopTieramisu> i wish i could see a proper 3d model for psylocke modeled by capcom
[2:15:44] <leith_aziz> @voodoolawyer Im sure I saw a Miles color
[2:15:50] <$ggbhtg> so did Heroes and Heralds let you customize movesets in some way, or?... @dds333a
[2:15:51] <+ashimpure> There is a mod for daily bugle at the top yeah lol
[2:15:52] <+Chronor655> I saw Thanos and becamse *very confused*
[2:16:00] <%townzzzzz> LUL the sound files
[2:16:03] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> this looks like it feels so amazing
[2:16:11] <leith_aziz> Thanos in MVC3 is weird pickyStare
[2:16:18] <skagtheprinceofhell> @voodoolawyer I mean that would need to be another CViper probably
[2:16:18] <Wofoeh> HIDDEN MISSILES
[2:16:21] <Mach5Mike> I assume the answer is something like input lag, but why did MVC3 tourneys only play on Bonne Wonderland?
[2:16:22] <Super_Voltekka> I can't wait til we get Jedah in this game
[2:16:28] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That snow is a slap on the bitrate though
[2:16:32] <%dds333a> @ggbhtg mostly just properties
[2:16:40] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> snow mokyMadge

[2:17:12] <leith_aziz> @Mach5Mike Least lag
[2:17:17] <Ardisan_> Yeah I would really like Jedah
[2:17:18] <Wofoeh> This looks like SF5 Bison from what I see from the moveset
[2:17:46] <%dds333a> head stomps
[2:17:49] <+TopTieramisu> his cardboard cape is cracking me up LUL
[2:17:57] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> does scarlet spider have a wavedash?
[2:18:00] <gruff_gridof> the work in progress vergil looked cool
[2:18:07] <big_oki> yo marvels gonna get razy
[2:18:08] <voodoolawyer> @TopTieramisu they're simply moving too fast for our eyes to process his cape movement
[2:18:17] <Wofoeh> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke its Mahvel, the answer is most likely yes
[2:18:17] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> rip psylocke
[2:18:17] <Super_Voltekka> I need both Jedah and War Machine in here pronto
[2:18:27] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @Wofoeh moky7

[2:20:30] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz always has
[2:20:42] <voodoolawyer> we need renegade lads like the folks modding MvC3 here to continue their hustle

[2:20:48] <leith_aziz> MAXIMUM SPIDER
[2:20:55] <+TopTieramisu> this is the continuity where psylocke takes over chun's body
[2:21:04] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> we got loops?
[2:21:06] <Super_Voltekka> @voodoolawyer Alternate scenario: We get another one but it's Next Dimension 2
[2:21:08] <leith_aziz> Behold!
[2:21:13] <Wofoeh> An full out marvel fighting game would be cooler (MVC would be cool as well) but like PURE Mahvel roster including punisher daredevil etc

[2:21:39] <voodoolawyer> Monkey Paw Curls: On PS5, we get Rise of the Imperfects 2
[2:21:43] <mrtanaka111> whoever designed that cyclops costume is a genius
[2:21:43] <+TopTieramisu> with marvel's meddling messing with infinite, i'd rather have a marvel only fighter
[2:21:46] <$ggbhtg> optic sweep is the OTG
[2:21:46] <Ardisan_> Thanium is so shiny
[2:21:47] <DeathByPoke7> lol the wesker shades animation
[2:21:58] <%dds333a> he plays like MVC2 LUL
[2:22:04] <+TopTieramisu> i mean capcom only fighter
[2:22:07] <+TopTieramisu> oops
[2:22:08] <Super_Voltekka> THANOS REIGNS
[2:22:14] <%notsoy> mvc2 cyke also had weird magic series
[2:22:17] <DeathByPoke7> like the half launch
[2:22:17] <agustorm123> No bubles thanos?
[2:22:32] <Wofoeh> @Wofoeh nah, give that roster to THESE Dudes, the ones that made UMVC3 (The ones workin on DNF Duel) and they'll do WONDERS
[2:22:42] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> if they made a pure marvel fighter, Frogman would be so great
[2:22:45] <@Menitta> 8ing
[2:22:57] <SaiyanShoto> When it comes to Infinite both Marvel and Capcom are to blame. Capcoms side of the roster was pretty disappointing too
[2:23:01] <%notsoy> btw 2M is 2f startup and launches
[2:23:14] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pretzel motions?
[2:23:20] <%dds333a> @greenherbwhitesmoke Fantomex? Kappa
[2:23:21] <Wofoeh> Also the "God battery" is gone, since whiffing normals dont charge meter
[2:23:28] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @dds333a which one?
[2:23:33] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> Kappa
[2:23:47] <leith_aziz> Rosters discussions arent really my forte coming from someone who's favorite fighter is GG. So the roster is usually Quality > Quantity for me
[2:23:55] <%dds333a> @greenherbwhitesmoke nah, just that Cyclops doesn't go L M H S like everybody else
[2:23:56] <Super_Voltekka> It would be a total bitch to put Blackheart in this game because of all the demons that accompany him
[2:24:12] <%dds333a> @greenherbwhitesmoke but yeah, multiple frogs LUL
[2:24:12] <+ManOfReason> Mo marvel
[2:24:23] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @dds333a think they would add dictator cyclops?
[2:24:26] <Solidnick18> did i miss marvel?
[2:24:35] <leith_aziz> Man?
[2:24:42] <Ardisan_> woMAN
[2:24:47] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @Solidnick18 they are learning the modded characters rn
[2:24:51] <%dds333a> @greenherbwhitesmoke could you imagine? LUL
[2:24:51] <Mach5Mike> YOOO Monster Hunter would be sick
[2:24:55] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> LOL
[2:24:56] <+pupil31> NO SHWEAT
[2:24:58] <%TungstenViper> OPTIC BLAST
[2:24:58] <Solidnick18> Oh alright thanks
[2:25:10] <%dds333a> THE THEME
[2:25:14] <leith_aziz> cohhO
[2:25:14] <%notsoy> you could do two separate MH characters who use completely different weapon loadouts

[3:31:52] <PFlare> That Psylocke theme.
[3:31:53] <$ggbhtg> @Nekros4442 aka, not possible so use DMC 4 Nero over Spencer
[3:32:07] <leith_aziz> ROLLBACK!!
[3:32:09] <Shade075> In fact the next mvc should just replace Spencer with Nero
[3:32:15] <%dds333a> @shad0wtag there are some fighting game characters with precise presses
[3:32:25] <%romulux420> CoolCat CoolCat
[3:32:28] <striderzer0> its cause psylocke is so fast+xfactor
[3:32:36] <metabot64> is shadow lady a modded character?
[3:32:37] <OkamiDude15> @Shad0wTag it would work the same way royal guard works : ) by not existing
[3:32:40] <%dds333a> Blazblue Makoto has holds for her drive moves
[3:32:43] <+strangedome> Spencer should be replace by EVERYONE!!!
[3:32:48] <%dds333a> @metabot64 yep
[3:32:48] <leith_aziz> BIONIC AAAAAAARRRRM
[3:32:49] <Wofoeh> Charge shot could be Wesker's Gat animation wise
[3:32:58] <+Scandal262> Psylocke install is nutty
[3:33:06] <Wofoeh> (For a Nero mod I mean)
[3:33:18] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a But max act changes moves altogether, that'd be a tall order to make normals and specials with different animations based on the precision of a button press from a single modder
[3:33:19] <%dds333a> Shadow Lady was just a color for chun in the game, but they modded her into a more unique character
[3:33:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> anybody else only able to watch in 360p?

[3:36:46] <metabot64> is there a lv1 that even comes close to spiral swords
[3:36:56] <%Shad0wTag> @dds333a Ah fair game. In that case I can imagine maybe making Nero a rekka character? Maybe use meter to get max act special moves and supers as a form of install maybe with his Devil Trigger?
