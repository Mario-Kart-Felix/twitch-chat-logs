[0:19:05] <thoraxe237> does Woolie know about the part in ttyd where you have to save the attitude era?
[0:19:06] <+ShutUpAceyP> woolie is genetically incapable of wielding handhelds
[0:19:06] <%Proxzo> anyone else getting lag stops?
[0:19:08] <Papa_Bearman> Woolie, did you have to spring for a Game Boy Player?
[0:19:10] <megatronsdong96> large hand problems

[0:19:31] <Texascourier> it was to soy for woolie
[0:19:31] <arkv01> the micro was basically a novelty item

[0:34:01] <+baggy3058> It also boosts attack power and HP

[0:34:03] <Taarin> Goombella/[Purple Girl] was my go to
[0:34:06] <+IncredibleMeh> the button also looks like a mouth to everyone else to right?

[0:34:10] <+Grayhammatter> MULTIBONK

[0:34:16] <bbblaketwitching> she is better early with badges than most

[0:34:32] <@Menitta> BOP
[0:34:33] <+Grayhammatter> give em the BOP
[0:34:34] <tusk_act4> Goombella isn't good in the long term, but you get plenty of Shine Sprites later so it's good.
[0:34:36] <+AsinPersuasion> she got attack and defense too
[0:34:37] <kingkeldeo31> Go to the door
[0:34:40] <sunnythedrunk> To be honest you should have saved the sprites
[0:34:42] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus She does 2 damage base now as well.
[0:34:51] <%Monkeyweed21> Goombella stays solid cuz of tattle
[0:34:51] <Dreziv> saved the sprites for fuckin' what? Flurrie?
[0:34:51] <bbblaketwitching> someone used gombella as a tank over B-man?
[0:34:52] <JetpackMcQuack> Imma bonk a bitch
[0:34:55] <Belakitu> Wait, what about Koops?
[0:34:56] <muniea3> Noose-chan
[0:34:57] <Kyphen15> Low key Shine Sprites are hard to find
[0:34:58] <generalve> Chat is he using a Emulator ?
[0:35:00] <+AsinPersuasion> @tusk_act4 her ability to give mario a second turn is dope
[0:35:00] <%snakest3alth> The noose
[0:35:02] <bbblaketwitching> what an odd individual
[0:35:02] <Am_Shigar00> I almost always keep the Goomba party member as my default, having tattle is always useful, and I love having the weakest Mario enemy kicking ass all the time.
[0:35:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Tattle will help woolie alot
[0:35:10] <sunnythedrunk> Saved the sprites for the last 3 partners duh
[0:35:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh hey mouse
[0:35:12] <nin10play> I can't wait until we get to Chapter 3. I wanna see Woolie love it
[0:35:12] <sleepystardewfarmer> have you checked out the split wall next to Luigi?
[0:35:13] <%doomerskeletor13> The Peadow Noose
[0:35:14] <NevikGamina> woolie be thinking of Disgaea LUL
[0:35:14] <+AsinPersuasion> and since mario is hands down the strongest it has the most value
[0:35:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like your tail mouse
[0:35:22] <Drusain> Item World? Woolie playing Disgaea?
[0:35:23] <+nechallenger> Oh hey look at the mouse
[0:35:26] <+CharredChord> who could that be? Kappa
[0:35:27] <+duckmeat_woohoo> WHO DAT MOUSE
[0:35:30] <thoraxe237> keep a noose around in a town where almost nobody has a neck, yea ok
[0:35:34] <+twohitgood> the simplifier is good
[0:35:34] <Dreziv> I imagine Woolie will get all the shines
[0:35:38] <NevikGamina> @Drusain probably LUL
[0:35:41] <+Grayhammatter> who dat mouse
[0:35:42] <bbblaketwitching> damn I missed this man getting aloooot of badges
[0:35:45] <%Proxzo> Does the random badge seller appear after chapter 1?
[0:35:46] <kingkeldeo31> That mouse has a weird lookin tail
[0:35:48] <%mrjojothelion> WHO DAT MOUSE THO
[0:35:48] <+baggy3058> Early badges in the shop suck.
[0:35:49] <grizzleyzack> Do you understand zoro?
[0:35:50] <Am_Shigar00> hm, kind of a weak badge set.
[0:35:51] <+marumariball> cool looking mouse
[0:35:52] <Hyper_charger> check out that mouse tail!
[0:35:54] <qsirius> Last Stand is OP as balls
[0:35:54] <+TheRisingPride> That mouse is real familiar
[0:35:56] <tusk_act4> <3
[0:35:56] <+AsinPersuasion> simplifier nerfs your SP gain though
[0:35:57] <ppbghd> talk to shopkeep
[0:35:58] <ingman112> Shhhhhh
[0:36:01] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Don't forget about about the Star Piece Merchant Dazzy
[0:36:02] <Potatoidea> Yeah, this mouse has a cool hat
[0:36:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> clempsMischief <3
[0:36:10] <@Menitta> I love the mice in Paper Mario
[0:36:11] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus If you talk to the mouse with the cap they have more in stock, the stuff on the shelf is just on sale, if you didn't already know.
[0:36:13] <+AsinPersuasion> hey that mouse looks familiar
[0:36:14] <+linSP> Mario must die style badge
[0:36:14] <Taarin> Super Appeal becomes more valuable later in the late game
[0:36:19] <bbblaketwitching> AND NOT HER FEET
[0:36:20] <Am_Shigar00> hmmmmmmmm
[0:36:21] <%SomersaultJustice> totes adorbz
[0:36:23] <+AbnormalVoid> hmmmm
[0:36:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie figured it out.
[0:36:24] <Solidnick18> hmmmmmm
[0:36:24] <noe_juan_kanobe> Is the Trouble Center even open at this point?
[0:36:28] <+pectusumbra> also talk to the store mouse and he'll offer more
[0:36:33] <+GreenCMD> check the shopkeep for quick change
[0:36:35] <ppbghd> isn't there a badge that lets you swap partners w/o losing a turn
[0:36:37] <+pectusumbra> Phantom Thief!
[0:36:41] <arkv01> what a cutie <3
[0:36:44] <Saltmeisterr> tattle her?
[0:36:45] <rubbishbinge> what a charming stranger
[0:36:45] <+CharredChord> SELLING BADGES BY DAYLIGHT
[0:36:47] <tusk_act4> You need to wait for that
[0:36:51] <%MonsterEnvy> The free swapping badge is underground.
[0:36:52] <Am_Shigar00> Whoooo knooooows?
[0:36:57] <%MonsterEnvy> With the Star Piece Merchant.
[0:36:58] <%p4ntless> I'm a shapeshifter~
[0:36:59] <%Proxzo> whaaddaya buyin?
[0:37:03] <+CharredChord> STEALING BADGES BY MOONLIGHT
[0:37:08] <Taarin> At Poes Masquerade!
[0:37:15] <%Superbro64> considering that ANY partner can be in a cutscene and offer their comments, Mowz would probably not remember
[0:37:18] <GypsyMagi> Has woolie tattled on her?
[0:37:18] <tusk_act4> Happy Flower is real good
[0:37:19] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Happy Flower PogChamp
[0:37:21] <guyman125> You should check the star piece merchant out for the quick change badge
[0:37:22] <%Superbro64> or anyone for that matter
[0:37:23] <megatronsdong96> At Poes Mousequerade
[0:37:24] <%dinnydanny777> Can you check her with Goombella?
[0:37:26] <tusk_act4> But unforuntely it is expensive.
[0:37:30] <Am_Shigar00> oooh, FP badges are pretty nice.
[0:37:31] <Bguy32> it's so you buy back badges you sold
[0:37:31] <bbblaketwitching> ooooh close call
[0:37:40] <redmage216> What about the rat at the docks?
[0:37:49] <Kyphen15> Sometimes theres a guy that sells badges by the noose
[0:37:50] <NevikGamina> time to go grinding LUL
[0:37:55] <bbblaketwitching> 46 down sadly
[0:37:55] <shiny_prinny> YES! YES! YES!
[0:37:56] <%Superbro64> reminder that Koops is lame, and you should switch to goombella for her much cooler and much less lame observations
[0:37:56] <+AsinPersuasion> YAAAAAS
[0:37:58] <+Euphbugg> GET SOME MORE MONIES
[0:37:59] <bbblaketwitching> no it isnt
[0:38:04] <sunnythedrunk> Happy Flower >>>>
[0:38:04] <+EternalJedi> the8bitSellout
[0:38:07] <Calek> that doesn't seem good at all
[0:38:08] <%MonsterEnvy> Happy Flower is the best
[0:38:12] <+HyperCharge_Sam> sell some badges you don't need
[0:38:12] <Solidnick18> happy flower the best
[0:38:13] <%Monkeyweed21> HAPPY FLOWER IS 10/10
[0:38:14] <Am_Shigar00> any badges he doesn't really need that he could sell?
[0:38:15] <$LightningLynx89> That is not better, Happy Flower is the best
[0:38:16] <%Proxzo> Does this badge rotate?
[0:38:16] <%psidefx> Happy flower is the move
[0:38:16] <Bguy32> sell badges for money
[0:38:19] <+baggy3058> FP drain isn't good, you use too much FP later in the game.
[0:38:21] <+CharredChord> Fuck that. Attack power is better
[0:38:23] <zettig> Don't get FP Drain! You only have 1 Attack Power
[0:38:23] <thorn0516> fp drain seems really bad
[0:38:23] <@Solidus_113> Isn't there one that goes in the world?
[0:38:25] <bbblaketwitching> fp drain is hilarious trash
[0:38:26] <+Euphbugg> Happy Flower
[0:38:26] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus The bearded guy near the noose also has some really special badges that might interest you...
[0:38:27] <%bread_assassin> FP drain doesn't seem worth it compared to Happy Flower.
[0:38:33] <tusk_act4> No it isn't. Because this game has low numbers, a single drop in attack power is really bad.
[0:38:33] <Calek> never lower attack
[0:38:34] <%SomersaultJustice> half
[0:38:39] <@Menitta> WHADDYA SELLIN
[0:38:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:38:41] <+QuadraticGravity> YEAH MORE MARIO
[0:38:46] <Taarin> Would FP drain drop his AP to zero?
[0:38:46] <qsirius> Flower Saver from the star piece shop is better
[0:38:49] <%MonsterEnvy> Attack FX R is a good pice
[0:38:52] <sunnythedrunk> Attack FX
[0:38:54] <+AsinPersuasion> @WoolieVersus sell attack fx

[0:38:57] <$LightningLynx89> Attack FX R
[0:38:58] <KatabolicRage> tbh that peril skill is hyper specific
[0:38:59] <+marumariball> duplicates stack
[0:39:01] <Am_Shigar00> Attack FX would be good if you don't care for sound effects.
[0:39:02] <bbblaketwitching> he could use hammer and fp moves
[0:39:02] <%kyh9> ATTACK FX R
[0:39:07] <%psidefx> Attack FX

[0:39:19] <R3c0n31> Duplicates do stack right?
[0:39:27] <thorn0516> duplicates do stack
[0:39:28] <+Grayhammatter> duplicates do stack
[0:39:31] <guyman125> you don't need the hp plus since it is just trading a bp level for a health level up
[0:39:39] <Solidnick18> yay the lottery

[1:08:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game is the ANTI-PAT, you HAVE to use your items.
[1:08:24] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus Talking with the Clerk at shops can have you store items for later. I think you can store a max of 32 items
[1:08:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> THEN USE FFS
[1:08:25] <NotHereToStream> consumables
[1:08:31] <Daveythe6thMoon> Status ailments are surprisingly rare to deal with in this game.
[1:08:31] <Bguy32> Use Your Items!
[1:08:33] <grimshuck> you recover from status ailments when battle ends.
[1:08:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Always be using items
[1:08:38] <%Proxzo> You can use the store to Store stuff.

[1:08:50] <Daveythe6thMoon> Water is bad for paper.
[1:08:57] <%bread_assassin> Does your inventory space ever increase?
[1:08:58] <megatronsdong96> Attache Case Mario Edition
[1:08:58] <%Superbro64> arent there inns with a 10 coin fee or something?
[1:08:59] <bbblaketwitching> but so are sharks
[1:09:10] <Am_Shigar00> @bread_assassin There is an optional upgrade for it.
[1:09:13] <Taarin> I feel that need to hoard items too, but it's not worth it
[1:09:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> As someone with ADHD, this game would punish me so hard for my distractability.
[1:09:23] <%democrazyyy> did they ever find out where the next destination is?
[1:09:24] <Darren716> The other pipe brought you back to town

[1:09:29] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> later
[1:09:29] <Am_Shigar00> This is very much a game that encourages you to use items.
[1:09:30] <bbblaketwitching> this is the ability check area
[1:09:31] <Taarin> later
[1:09:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> hmm

[1:25:56] <IncelFactory> gold bar is money storage
[1:25:58] <+AsinPersuasion> but you can't max all 3
[1:26:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> Capitalism DansGame
[1:26:05] <@Solidus_113> Storing is universal
[1:26:05] <Hyper_charger> the gold bars are for recipe at zess t
[1:26:07] <SixthSun2> Gold bars are so you can have more money than your money cap
[1:26:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> YAAAAAAS
[1:26:07] <nin10play> Gold bars are only for selling. It's if you max out money
[1:26:08] <megatronsdong96> invest in gold Mario
[1:26:09] <%PA_Master> You have a max number of coins, but you can store gold bars instead
[1:26:10] <Papa_Bearman> When you have too many coins, just buy gold bars and store them in a store.
[1:26:10] <eldragon_1> thank you reggie
[1:26:12] <+HyperCharge_Sam> coins stack to 999
[1:26:12] <+Beniial> Money compression
[1:26:14] <Daveythe6thMoon> God bless multi-dimensional shared storage!
[1:26:16] <KasiCrafter> Gold bars are bought and sold for the same price.
[1:26:23] <%SuperKirby24> nice
[1:26:24] <Hyper_charger> you can use them as a recipe ingredient
[1:26:30] <bbblaketwitching> please store other shit tho
[1:26:30] <%Proxzo> You can only hold 999 coins

[1:26:38] <alexandrecau> mario games
[1:26:40] <%Proxzo> So gold is a way to store up gold
[1:26:42] <Darren716> You can also very rarely find/win gold bars to sell
[1:26:43] <Am_Shigar00> @Hyper_charger Wait, seriously? What does it make?
[1:26:48] <Hyper_charger> they are also ingredients
[1:26:50] <Papa_Bearman> May as well store that Inn Coupon - it has more value later in the game.
[1:26:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Time to never use that mystery
[1:27:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Store it, you'll probably always be near an item shop when you're near an inn.
[1:27:09] <bbblaketwitching> at least he can sell it later
[1:27:13] <+clausover> Btw make sure to talk to the guy lumpy at the port to get the big money
[1:27:17] <bbblaketwitching> and get more stuff now
[1:27:21] <Papa_Bearman> Remember, it's a free night at ANY inn, and inns get expensive later.
[1:27:21] <Hyper_charger> gold is a expensive ingredient
[1:27:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> inn coupon
[1:27:22] <%DatAsuna> good point squeaks

[1:36:04] <+duckmeat_woohoo> Reggie has a kid?
[1:36:08] <+TheRisingPride> It resets at midnight, not "check at midnight"
[1:36:08] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus It detects if you change the time on the clock and you'll need to pay like 100 coins for a new one. This lottery is actually super rigged when you'll even win.
[1:36:08] <bbblaketwitching> midnight reset my man
[1:36:12] <+VorpalSlash> Every day, midnight is the turnover
[1:36:15] <RunoEddie> It's a waste of money!

[1:36:39] <+QuadraticGravity> @WoolieVersus it takes a real life year to get a win
[1:36:53] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus You get a ticket which is set numbers. The board has the winning numbers. At midnight the board changes the numbers. You keep the one ticket until you decide to get a new on. So one ticket can be used multiple days

[2:54:01] <%SirGO0SE> Reggie LUL
[2:54:01] <bbblaketwitching> too obvious
[2:54:03] <grimshuck> for fucks sake. tremor ignores defense.

[2:54:04] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Tremor Ignores defense
[2:54:05] <+AsinPersuasion> there was the 3
[2:54:06] <Gallhint> \mooka chakka pacha
[2:54:07] <kingkeldeo31> Tremor can hit air borne if you'r goood enough

[2:54:08] <Daveythe6thMoon> Hopefully this experience teaches this: Bring some syrup with ya!
[2:54:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> @snakest3alth But what if he needs them later?
[2:54:10] <+TheRisingPride> tremor hits flying enemies if you keep the combo going enough to reach them
[2:54:19] <%mrjojothelion> YO THE FLIP THO
[2:54:24] <Hellarussian> whens Rawk?
[2:54:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Maybe you should use it more than once
[2:54:26] <+Cavumentum> If you hit the buttons well enough
[2:54:26] <thetntm> it does if you do it enough
[2:54:26] <+Grayhammatter> it affects them
[2:54:27] <Bguy32> You would know if you actually use it!
[2:54:28] <+pectusumbra> it's really good if you can do combo
[2:54:30] <@Menitta> Oh tremor ignores defense
[2:54:32] <glass_marcus> It depends how well you do
[2:54:32] <bbblaketwitching> it goes high enough
[2:54:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> ALLLLLLLL
[2:54:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> This isn't Pokemon, there's no Typing.
[2:54:34] <$Superdandy96> Tremor is busted good... if you can nail the timing
[2:54:36] <Self_esteampunk> yeah
[2:54:36] <+Euphbugg> need 3 success to hit air
[2:54:37] <rubbishbinge> if you shake it up enough
[2:54:38] <bbblaketwitching> GET GOOD
[2:54:39] <Papa_Bearman> If you keep the combo going long enough, it'll hit air enemies after a few.
[2:54:39] <%Struggleful> If effects people in the air if you DON'T FUCK IT UP
[2:54:40] <%GrassCannon> ALL enemies
[2:54:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> "All"
[2:54:41] <+pectusumbra> and it goes ALOT
[2:54:41] <Solidnick18> It's amazing

[2:54:44] <Solidnick18> ALL
[2:54:44] <%Monkeyweed21> it goes higher if you do good
[2:54:46] <zekana> higher the trimmer level, the higher the damage reaches
[2:54:46] <FoxInABeret> Big enough success hits fliers too.
[2:54:47] <sileo_patronus> It does not say Grounded Enemies
[2:54:50] <+Euphbugg> It maxes at 5 bars, 3 for air
[2:54:51] <shiny_prinny> the more bars you get, the higher the tremor hits
[2:54:51] <bbblaketwitching> THERE ARE MANY MANY BARS
[2:54:56] <+CharredChord> more bars: more damage
[2:54:57] <delta278899> You can hold your fire with sweat treat by Holding left. @WoolieVersus
[2:55:00] <Papa_Bearman> There are six bars, I think.
[2:55:00] <Nyerp> pow block tho

[2:55:50] <grimshuck> why is he using piercing on a downed koopa
[2:55:50] <Bguy32> It's Woolie just completely ignoring the tattles?

[2:57:56] <+Grayhammatter> they have one defense
[2:57:56] <Nyerp> pow block tho
[2:57:58] <%kyh9> Hammer
[2:57:58] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> koops
[2:57:58] <thetntm> normal hammer works
[2:57:58] <Papa_Bearman> Koops can take care of them!
[2:57:58] <%gatorafan> ULTRAAAAAAAA
[2:57:59] <+GreenCMD> they have 1 def
[2:57:59] <Darren716> No woolie
[2:58:00] <%kyh9> No
[2:58:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Use Koops
[2:58:01] <bevyrage> fire or koops
[2:58:02] <%Proxzo> reg hammer is fine
[2:58:02] <SixthSun2> they just have 1 defense
[2:58:02] <+QuadraticGravity> means they take 1 less damage from each instance
[2:58:03] <%kyh9> They have 1 defense
[2:58:04] <%mrjojothelion> normal works
[2:58:05] <frigglefroogle> reg hammer is good
[2:58:05] <+TheRisingPride> 1 definitely, but fire is effective
[2:58:05] <+Euphbugg> Switch partner with enemy and use Koops turn
[2:58:06] <%Jpshum> Nice
[2:58:06] <Bguy32> Woolie had completely forgotten all the information from the tattles NotLikeThis
[2:58:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Just hammer them
[2:58:08] <%mrjojothelion> or that does too
[2:58:10] <+HyperCharge_Sam> yeah!
[2:58:10] <thetntm> normal hammer perirces eneough
[2:58:10] <Am_Shigar00> As long as you do 2 or more damage, you're good.
[2:58:11] <%kyh9> Normal hammer
[2:58:12] <kulmoth> does woolie understand how defense works?
[2:58:12] <bbblaketwitching> yes you have to use the thing you bought yourself woolie
[2:58:12] <Papa_Bearman> Eh, this works, too.
[2:58:13] <Solidnick18> well then
[2:58:14] <shiny_prinny> they have 1 def and your jump does 1 per hit
[2:58:14] <lambishly> that works too
[2:58:15] <Taarin> SeemsGood
[2:58:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> REKT
[2:58:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> That works too
[2:58:16] <+Euphbugg> Fire works
[2:58:16] <guyman125> hammer does 2 damage so it kills them despite them having 1 def
[2:58:17] <Taarin> ez
[2:58:25] <Nyerp> items = good
[2:58:28] <+GreenCMD> Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Slow
[2:58:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> @guyman125 2-1=1 ??????????
[2:58:31] <lambishly> used an item Pat is SCREAMING right now lol
[2:58:33] <bbblaketwitching> basic math is the deal
[2:58:34] <Daveythe6thMoon> Works just fine. Like Paper Mario wants you to do: You use it or you lose it!
[2:58:34] <rubbishbinge> hammer with the action command does 2 damage
[2:58:39] <%MonsterEnvy> Piercing blow is worthless unless the enemy has more then 2 defense. In all other cases Power Smash is better
[2:58:41] <%Superbro64> woolie knows how to use items?? :O
[2:58:45] <bbblaketwitching> no
[2:58:49] <redmage216> back one room then up
[2:58:49] <%Monkeyweed21> the Thousand year LP
[2:58:51] <Bguy32> no
[2:58:51] <thetntm> wooolie
[2:58:52] <kingkeldeo31> Jump does half of hammers damage but twice
[2:58:55] <frigglefroogle> ??
[2:58:55] <thesickestzak> :)
[2:58:56] <Taarin> It's fine I guess
[2:58:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's back a room and upstairs.
[2:58:57] <rubbishbinge> how can this be
[2:58:57] <Papa_Bearman> You're wasting FP on Piercing Blow.
[2:59:02] <jackarrow1> piercing is wasting fp
[2:59:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:59:04] <SiegeJay> S
[2:59:05] <guyman125> @Th3SmartAlec they have 1 life so that is correct
[2:59:07] <stormhawk9891> Enough with the piercing blow
[2:59:10] <bbblaketwitching> SS
[2:59:13] <Kyphen15> I think I remember using an elevator to get to him
[2:59:14] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Stop using Piercing Blow on 1 hp enemies with only 1 defense
[2:59:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @guyman125 Yeah, I was being smarmy about it
[2:59:19] <Bguy32> I swear Paige would be better at this than Woolie
[2:59:22] <glass_marcus> Honestly, Piercing blow is usually not worth it
[2:59:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Bguy32 OOF
[2:59:24] <%MonsterEnvy> It's does nothing
[2:59:29] <%Proxzo> he's doing it
[2:59:32] <bbblaketwitching> @bguy32 let's not get crazy
[2:59:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just a mention, there's a difference between trying to be helpful and bitching everytime Woolie doesn't do everything perfect.
[2:59:37] <%SirGO0SE> we cry

[3:00:23] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[3:00:26] <bbblaketwitching> ya big ol feet lover
[3:00:26] <%Proxzo> Should we tell woolie the answer?
[3:00:26] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:00:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Everyday the Kayfabe gets weaker and weaker.
[3:00:32] <%GrassCannon> Reggie Hyuga
[3:00:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yep
[3:00:38] <Papa_Bearman> No, let's not tell Woolie.
[3:00:39] <SiegeJay> Koops in the room with the green elevator
[3:00:42] <bbblaketwitching> its pretty hard
[3:00:43] <Papa_Bearman> He'll find the guy.
[3:00:43] <gilgatwitcher> I miss Mario's Spindash from Paper Mario 64...
[3:00:48] <GHouseduivel> Woolie being kept AFOOT by Reggie
[3:00:49] <%kyh9> This one is pretty obnoxious
[3:00:52] <zettig> He's near where you met Ms.Mowz.
[3:00:52] <frigglefroogle> yall no spoils
[3:00:54] <bbblaketwitching> or at least I sucked at it

[3:01:02] <%Proxzo> It's a blessing
[3:01:05] <%mrjojothelion> you will figure it out
[3:01:10] <+Grayhammatter> it lasts a long time
[3:01:12] <%Superbro64> use items to regain fp :)
[3:01:14] <Am_Shigar00> This is definetly the worst part of the game, backtracking.
[3:01:15] <kingkeldeo31> It tells whent it runs out
[3:01:18] <CursedNobleman> he appears if you input the IS Code
[3:01:24] <Taarin> It happens more often on higher payments
[3:01:26] <Kyphen15> Happens more often when you pay more
[3:01:27] <SixthSun2> The amount paid determines the length
[3:01:30] <%mrjojothelion> that's why the more expensive stuff is worth it
[3:01:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> For Mitch Digger
[3:01:34] <vaderxyz1970> Pay 50 for Best Buff
[3:01:34] <bbblaketwitching> DrinkPurple

[3:01:43] <+Grayhammatter> GTAB
[3:01:44] <nin10play> I think 5 coin path gives you 5 uses. I don't know if that is 100% accurate
[3:01:56] <bbblaketwitching> I believe it
[3:01:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> She can
[3:01:59] <Am_Shigar00> Oh god, how much do you get from the 50 coin buff if it went off on a Amazee Dazee?
[3:02:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie with the 400 IQ
[3:02:10] <Papa_Bearman> When the Koopa's on its back, it has no defense, so anything will hurt him.
[3:02:10] <nin10play> Reggie is learning the strats
[3:02:11] <shiny_prinny> the strats

[3:02:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:02:55] <time_axis> that part of the play as a horrible stage accident
[3:02:55] <CursedNobleman> @Th3SmartAlec i know, hes surpassing my expectations

[3:03:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @AsinPersuasion Some may view side quests as a waste of stream time

[3:21:25] <KillswitchLikesToPlay> Sup @WoolieVersus
[3:21:26] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus Some Tips to know about Koops as of now. The "Counter" was because Koops has a unique attribute to him where he has a defense of 1 but it goes to 0 if an enemy jumps on him, like other Koopas. And his normal attack has 2 stylish moves, you are just mashing too fast for the second prompt to appear.
[3:21:30] <StuffHunter> They throw cans and hammers for damage, the rest are items.
[3:21:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Not to this extent per chapter
[3:21:36] <Am_Shigar00> It's like those intermission segments from Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
[3:21:36] <%Superbro64> chapter 1.5 doodGood
[3:21:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Alright, eyes forward, don't talk to anyone.

[3:21:50] <SixthSun2> It's about 3 side quests, you had some post-prologue quests that were sitting in there
[3:21:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> What is that child doing there!
[3:21:56] <%Monkeyweed21> I feel bad for the anime viewers suffering through this for like 5 or 6 episodes

[3:22:21] <@Solidus_113> sell the sheep

[3:22:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sell sheep Woolie
[3:22:50] <%mrjojothelion> this is true
[3:22:54] <Am_Shigar00> Basically it's the same logic as the regular Koopas.
[3:22:55] <Cynical_Canadian> Hustle and flow!
[3:22:56] <%doomerskeletor13> I think the rest will go faster after this clean up episode
[3:22:57] <bbblaketwitching> ah, they sell mr softener here... great...
[3:22:57] <rubbishbinge> he is a koopa
[3:22:57] <CursedNobleman> @Cynical_Canadian thats not ripping them off. thats shipping costs

[3:23:03] <+pectusumbra> sell it

[3:23:05] <shiny_prinny> he's like the enemy koopas basically, yes
[3:23:06] <guyman125> natural +1 def, same logic as regular koopas
[3:23:11] <Papa_Bearman> Just like every other koopa, when he's standing he has 1 DEF, but when he's on his back, he has 0 DEF.
[3:23:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Sell the sheep for money
[3:23:12] <Belakitu> respect the hustle
[3:23:15] <thetntm> does your storage keep between stores though?
[3:23:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> That Hoops advice went WOOSH
[3:23:21] <thetntm> because if it does then you can do it all in one trip
[3:23:22] <%MonsterEnvy> Koops is like other Koopas has a def of 1 but can be knocked on his back
[3:23:22] <%Superbro64> more reason koops is lame. Always pick best girl.
[3:23:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> I was smuggling bycicles
[3:23:23] <GodlyLuigi> Reggie if you guard the move that would knock him over he stays up
[3:23:24] <+pectusumbra> yes it's like an item box

[3:23:27] <+AsinPersuasion> but hes selling the sheep for 20
[3:23:29] <GHouseduivel> You turning Welsh Woolie?

[3:23:40] <Drusain> Pat would be doing the sleepy sheep hustle for 6 hours off screen
[3:23:46] <KatabolicRage> he works like a koopa trooper
[3:23:52] <Bguy32> You don't have to fight every enemy you see. these goombas don't give you any exp
[3:23:54] <+QuadraticGravity> He's super tanky but you have to active block any jump attacks

[3:23:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Still mashing that button LUL
[3:23:59] <Am_Shigar00> You can actually put him in the front when fighting Spinias in the sewer and he'll just tank everything.

[3:24:23] <Papa_Bearman> No, because it's too small to get to you.
[3:24:28] <%MonsterEnvy> No just cause it was not near you
[3:24:29] <guyman125> Please skip the fights,they are not give experience to be worth it
[3:24:32] <bbblaketwitching> the battle ended and the stuff wasn't large enough
[3:24:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie sell the sheep for money
[3:24:35] <+Cavumentum> At this point these battles are just for the money
[3:24:36] <Am_Shigar00> It was too tiny to hurt you
[3:24:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> .......
[3:24:48] <%Superbro64> fights DO give the same amount of Star Points though
[3:24:48] <guyman125> Thank you Reggie
[3:24:50] <kingkeldeo31> You're getting 1 exp per fight
[3:24:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie. This is giving you no EXP
[3:24:50] <@Solidus_113> This is Minh-tier grinding
[3:24:51] <%krispen_wa> ...so i was grinding offscreen
[3:24:53] <Zeemod155> You do not need to grind
[3:24:53] <+Cavumentum> which you could get more of via sheep hustle
[3:24:54] <nin10play> Woolie only likes grinding in private
[3:24:54] <lambishly> It's fine dude it's part of why we're here
[3:24:55] <frigglefroogle> fighting enemies is a time loss honestly for the exp you get

[3:24:55] <Papa_Bearman> Eh, it's fine.
[3:24:58] <+Rukabuk> The grind is LEARNING HOW TO STYLE. There's skill involved in this game. KILL THEM ALL!
[3:24:58] <%SvenHolgersson> The music is so endearing
[3:24:59] <bbblaketwitching> If you do want to grind, there are better places

[3:25:03] <+TheRisingPride> 2/100
[3:25:06] <%Monkeyweed21> You dont need to grind Woolie
[3:25:07] <$Superdandy96> Meh, I’m fine with it
[3:25:11] <%SvenHolgersson> Is this what people who liked FF7 felt?
[3:25:11] <bbblaketwitching> far more than one at a time
[3:25:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> 2 EXP LUL
[3:25:16] <Taarin> Every area makes sure you get adequate xp
[3:25:16] <Zeemod155> You can never do any side-quests/back-tracking and STILL be overpowered
[3:25:16] <Am_Shigar00> grinding in this game is mostly just for money and action command practice.
[3:25:17] <Kyphen15> Its cool, its been really fun watching the grind actually
[3:25:19] <%SomersaultJustice> Snailper Mario!
[3:25:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man I really wish the 7th Stand User didn't fall apart.
[3:25:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Only 1 xp
[3:25:27] <%krispen_wa> is 7th stand user one of the only LPs Woolie's never finished?
[3:25:31] <thesickestzak> Remember JoJo?
[3:25:36] <%yeknomlive> sounds like older smt
[3:25:37] <%SomersaultJustice> oh yeah, jojo, that was a thing
[3:25:40] <Daveythe6thMoon> For now, but at some point these old fights will start netting you 1 star point per fight. That's when it's best to just start avoiding them.
[3:25:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @krispen_wa It got really rough
[3:25:49] <%SomersaultJustice> look at that proto luma!
[3:25:50] <%SvenHolgersson> JoJo Siwa?
[3:25:51] <kingkeldeo31> use pow block
[3:25:52] <TeeJabs> yeah grinding aint super helpful
[3:25:52] <%MonsterEnvy> These guys are only giving you 1 xp
[3:25:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> why
[3:25:54] <bbblaketwitching> 5, nice
[3:25:58] <Am_Shigar00> I wonder what happened to that LP, that's sad to hear, I wasn't into Jojo when Woolie started it.
[3:26:00] <$Superdandy96> Jojo was fun, but good the enemy place meant was mean.
[3:26:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> But style at least
[3:26:09] <%emperordread> That JoJo game was the most fun that I didn't understand. Had no idea what was going on
[3:26:13] <%SirGO0SE> i was enjoying jojo lp anyway just for being in that universe
[3:26:14] <BreakersAweigh> yeah its best to start avoiding battles when you're getting 1-2 exp each
[3:26:15] <BlackMage66652> @WoolieVersus You got 1 xp for all of that
[3:26:17] <kingkeldeo31> Literally wasted 5 FP
[3:26:17] <+HyperCharge_Sam> 1exp for 5 enemies
[3:26:17] <NevikGamina> yikes
[3:26:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1 EXP
[3:26:19] <%SirGO0SE> but i get all the reasons you stoppd
[3:26:21] <+Euphbugg> 1 EXP
[3:26:29] <bbblaketwitching> you could have avoided that, just saying
[3:26:29] <%krispen_wa> 7th Stand User has some REALLY hype fanservice, but yeah the gameplay was pretty garbo
[3:26:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Goomba's are not longer worth it pretty much
[3:26:39] <shiny_prinny> enemies give less star points as you level up to
[3:26:39] <+pectusumbra> that's how the game anti-grinds you
[3:26:41] <bbblaketwitching> not the end of the world, but it is an option
[3:26:44] <%iHum4n> 5 for 0, then they give you a pity xp
[3:26:45] <%SvenHolgersson> I never had to grind in this game its one of the reasons its so good
[3:26:45] <+greenfall> mostly practice for action command i guess
[3:26:49] <judgemailman> You get less exp for easier enemies as you level up
[3:26:52] <Solidnick18> ooooh
[3:26:52] <+Euphbugg> the leveling scale in this game makes is so you don't need to farm much at all
[3:26:52] <Am_Shigar00> @krispen_wa Would you say it's better as more of an experience than as an actual game?
[3:26:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:26:54] <nin10play> Actually they didn't give you any EXP, but the game makes it so that you always get 1 EXP after a battle
[3:26:55] <%bread_assassin> Did that LP ever finish?
[3:26:57] <grimshuck> I wonder how long it's going take from him to realise he's mashing Koops' stylish
[3:26:58] <bbblaketwitching> time for the PITTTT
[3:27:02] <%Monkeyweed21> its made for people who dont take 5 minutes per random battle
[3:27:04] <Solidnick18> @bread_assassin nope
[3:27:05] <skyheys> dragon quest isn't anywhere near that grindy
[3:27:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @bbblaketwitching Not yet
[3:27:06] <%Superbro64> reminder that though the enemies ARENT worth it for exp, they ARE worth it for building Star Point pips
[3:27:10] <%kyh9> What game?
[3:27:14] <Taarin> You will eventually stop getting even 1 exp after you level
[3:27:20] <%kyh9> Which game???
[3:27:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:27:37] <jubejube56> I feel like grinding in Octopath Traveler was the worst it ever got for me
[3:27:37] <$Superdandy96> I always thought they should’ve went the earthbound route, but meh, what are you gonna do
[3:27:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> And then right back to the Pedo Meadow
[3:27:41] <BlackMage66652> @Superbro64 Star Points ARE xp
[3:27:42] <bbblaketwitching> its only natural
[3:27:43] <Merlow> I'd happily play through DQ4 and 5 anytime

[3:28:21] <bbblaketwitching> not that its actually viable or anything

[3:31:08] <nin10play> Cooking it isn't that bad. It becomes an item that heals 30 HP and 15 FP I think
[3:31:08] <%DatAsuna> or just throw it away
[3:31:10] <+AsinPersuasion> like tons of incoming damage
[3:31:11] <%Monkeyweed21> then invest and get 300 coins

[3:36:29] <+AsinPersuasion> its a slow hustle
[3:36:31] <jackarrow1> If they do sell the leaf it might be better to cook it first and then sell it
[3:36:32] <Papa_Bearman> When you're not being tasked with being a drug mule and roughing up townspeople, you're being sent to listen to old people bitch for leaves.

[3:38:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> O I L
[3:38:36] <+pectusumbra> get that badge then go to underground badge boy and trade your star pieces
[3:38:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie has already decided to ignore rat forever
[3:38:46] <+AsinPersuasion> storage is 32 items isn't it? so 64
[3:38:48] <CursedNobleman> @bbblaketwitching he reformatted that part of his brain to make room for SICK DMC COMBOS
[3:38:52] <luckysteak> get rid of that multibounce trash! (exaggeration)
[3:38:54] <Egoangell> buy badges NOWWWWW
[3:38:56] <frigglefroogle> soft stomp is sellable, not worth it imo
[3:39:03] <time_axis> those sleepy sheep always looked like an egg to me
[3:39:12] <tttruest> have they tried pit yet?
[3:39:13] <+mikeabbages> def egg sheeps
[3:39:16] <Taarin> 50 coins tho
[3:39:19] <missingangle> I love and hate that in Undertale where it's like "You think we'd buy your fucking STICKS?! Get outta here!"
[3:39:19] <%yeknomlive> 50 hp 50 coins
[3:39:20] <+Grayhammatter> sell the shroom
[3:39:20] <bbblaketwitching> @cursednobleman I believe that so hard, and I'm still oh so sad
[3:39:23] <KatabolicRage> flog the shroom man you won't need it forever
[3:39:24] <thetntm> Woolie you can store infinite sheep and retreive them in the peadows
[3:39:25] <nin10play> @tttruest No they don't even know it exists yet
[3:39:27] <+IceyCone> cook the fire flower c:
[3:39:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> ........
[3:39:34] <stormhawk9891> Cook the leaf?
[3:39:34] <Papa_Bearman> You can cook the Fire Flower, but that turns it into an HP/FP restore instead of an attack.
[3:39:35] <Daveythe6thMoon> If you're gonna sell badges best to wait til later. Really accrue a big collection of badges and make one hecc of a profit.
[3:39:35] <%mrjojothelion> cook the fire flower
[3:39:35] <+TheRisingPride> sell shroom or store it
[3:39:42] <nin10play> Flower makes soup
[3:39:44] <KatabolicRage> by all means sell the thing, it's just a healing item
[3:39:45] <tttruest> @nin10play hype
[3:39:45] <@Solidus_113> nah sell it
[3:39:46] <frigglefroogle> sell the shroom if you want, youre not gonna use it
[3:39:47] <CursedNobleman> @bbblaketwitching if you want to level yourself while gaming, you gotta delete less important things after all
[3:39:48] <time_axis> it wasnt really "everyone"
[3:39:48] <+pectusumbra> I mean you could grind out 20 coins right now
[3:39:50] <redmage216> rat is limited time option
[3:39:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> store it or sell it
[3:39:54] <SideChar> but that oil rat tho?
[3:39:56] <+pectusumbra> 50 isn't worth it
[3:40:00] <kingkeldeo31> Leaf
[3:40:01] <shiny_prinny> even if you sold the ultra, you could always grind money and buy more
[3:40:01] <Taarin> Buy the shroom, cook it and sell the dish
[3:40:01] <%yeknomlive> the cook was so nice in the first game :<
[3:40:05] <Daveythe6thMoon> This toad is PETTY. She will never let that go.

[3:40:48] <GHouseduivel> No.
[3:40:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie, please tell this man that it is not Random. The reason she fucked it up is you need recipe books for later.

[3:41:24] <redmage216> slow and gradual are kinda meh
[3:41:24] <+QuadraticGravity> you can cook a mystery for actual RNG
[3:41:24] <Taarin> I woke up this morning, made cereal and it turned into a mistake Kappa
[3:41:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:41:25] <nin10play> Mystery is like 1 coin
[3:41:26] <Papa_Bearman> I think it's only 2 coins.
[3:41:26] <%yeknomlive> but it's a mystery
[3:41:29] <+AsinPersuasion> invest in rat coin
[3:41:31] <%krispen_wa> Who is this Mister E
[3:41:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> It sells for 1 coin
[3:41:33] <%LeiaSkynoober> Does Woolie HATE old ladies?!
[3:41:37] <@Solidus_113> Mystery could be a super shroom
[3:41:40] <%LuckyLagomorph> @WoolieVersus Apologize or NO BALLS

[3:42:11] <+AsinPersuasion> soft stomp
[3:42:13] <BlackMage66652> MIND GOBLINS RUNNING WILD
[3:42:14] <Taarin> Super shroom is more economical
[3:42:15] <redmage216> you could sell soft stomp
[3:42:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> soft
[3:42:17] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[3:42:18] <+pectusumbra> yes, he's looking at the good one that just gives you FP all the time
[3:42:19] <+AsinPersuasion> also mega rush
[3:42:20] <thetntm> store 32 sheep and make 64 coins
[3:42:22] <shiny_prinny> would the timing tutor seller have new stuff now?

[3:42:24] <bbblaketwitching> good
[3:42:28] <grimshuck> Just sell the fucking ultrashroom
[3:42:29] <sunnythedrunk> Selling Piercing blow or Mega Rush P
[3:42:31] <StuffHunter> I vote sell shroom
[3:42:32] <luckysteak> multibounce gotta go
[3:42:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Peril badges are for challenge runs @WoolieVersus
[3:42:34] <%Superbro64> TIME TO SELL SOME SHEEP
[3:42:35] <myonmyonmyonmyonmyon_> can you cook the mystery?
[3:42:35] <+AsinPersuasion> people were saying not to
[3:42:40] <Am_Shigar00> Is HP Plus worth it? You could just level HP up if you feel you need more.
[3:42:40] <guyman125> you aren't doing a peril run so sell the mega rush
[3:42:41] <+paladinstarbuster> just wait
[3:42:43] <MrRavine> Timing Tutor DansGame
[3:42:44] <@Solidus_113> just sell the shroom
[3:42:44] <Papa_Bearman> I've never, ever used Soft Stomp.
[3:42:45] <%DrStinkers> just sell anything other than ultra shroom
[3:42:46] <alwayschilling > Sell shroom, there are tons of heading items coming up
[3:42:48] <kingkeldeo31> Multibounce sucks
[3:42:51] <%Struggleful> Hustle Hard
[3:42:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> @grimshuck no. I need to keep it clogging up my inventory
[3:42:56] <Warbot40> Piercing really isn't that useful
[3:42:56] <%krispen_wa> Just sell everything
[3:43:05] <%yeknomlive> how many of those super shrooms are in the game
[3:43:06] <+AsinPersuasion> chat with the shit opinions now lmao
[3:43:10] <falyden> I love how we haven't even started chapter 2 yet
[3:43:12] <+AsinPersuasion> pierce is great
[3:43:13] <BlackMage66652> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:43:15] <bbblaketwitching> the people who don't want you to sell the shroom are the ones who have 30 elixirs at the end of their games
[3:43:15] <%GrassCannon> You won't need the Shroom if you just learn to Royal Guard 4Head
[3:43:18] <+AsinPersuasion> multi bounce scales even better
[3:43:19] <%Superbro64> reminder that the badge shop has a another set of badges to sell
[3:43:19] <@Solidus_113> there are more than enough healing items you can collect, you don't need a single 50
[3:43:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching Fucking PROBLEM!?
[3:43:26] <Am_Shigar00> @Warbot40 Pierce can be useful against certain later enemies, but yeah, not too big right now.
[3:43:27] <%DensityD> yes yes
[3:43:28] <+AsinPersuasion> because jump eventually does 4
[3:43:29] <%mrjojothelion> good move
[3:43:31] <nin10play> @Warbot40 There are Clefts in the next 2 chapters. Piercing Blow is amazing
[3:43:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why you calling me out like that?
[3:43:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> correct
[3:43:43] <guyman125> Hp up is just turning a bp level into an hp level
[3:43:44] <%Jetzord> @Warbot40 Pierce is fantastic once you get to the later enemies and the badge taht reduces FP use
[3:43:45] <bbblaketwitching> @commandersqueaks yes, your existence and opinions. they're bad
[3:43:55] <%Monkeyweed21> You aren't good at this game so dont bother with Peril badges
[3:43:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching Next you'll say Pat is neurotic.
[3:44:05] <+pectusumbra> Again, it'd be fine to sell, but there's literally a trick that lets you get 20 coins a run, so 50 isn't that much
[3:44:06] <thetntm> piercing blow is very helpful
[3:44:15] <Taarin> "What if I need my 10 ultra shrooms before the final boss"
[3:44:19] <%SomersaultJustice> I only saw one of those FF6 limits in my entire life
[3:44:21] <+TheRisingPride> isn't peril runs the key in speedruns?
[3:44:23] <BlackMage66652> Woolie's Mind Goblins have activated
[3:44:23] <Calek> oh thankgoodness he didn't buy FP Drain
[3:44:26] <+AsinPersuasion> its 1/8th health and a fight has to last like 3 minutes
[3:44:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> RIP RatCoin
[3:44:32] <%DensityD> is there any way this UI could be better?
[3:44:37] <strifer413> oh shit woolie needs to play ff6 someday maybe
[3:44:41] <kingkeldeo31> F for Rat
[3:44:44] <Am_Shigar00> If there are any skills you don't really use, might as well take them off.
[3:44:44] <nin10play> You mean FF 8?
[3:44:48] <+AsinPersuasion> they're called desperation attacks
[3:44:52] <Rhinoprotoss> FF6 encounter rate is fucked
[3:44:52] <%yeknomlive> no ff6 did have hidden limit breaks
[3:44:53] <+AsinPersuasion> nope
[3:44:57] <%SomersaultJustice> He'll probably play X-2 first
[3:44:58] <glass_marcus> Take of pierce
[3:45:03] <Warbot40> Man I miss good Mario RPGs...
[3:45:03] <Leddy_at_Home> Peril Strats are for people that know this game inside out, so don't feel bad for not using them.
[3:45:03] <%yeknomlive> not practical at all but cool
[3:45:09] <bbblaketwitching> @commandersqueaks na, clearly pat is a very sane role model we should all aspire to <3
[3:45:11] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont use power bounce
[3:45:12] <+ShazBo2000> HOW THE HELL WOOLIE NEVWR PLAYED FFVI Aka FF III on sens
[3:45:15] <%vaporousTippler> You can also play FF6 with two players. Technically.
[3:45:15] <kingkeldeo31> Get rid of pirece
[3:45:17] <+AsinPersuasion> they're insanely hard to trigger
[3:45:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching Clearly!
[3:45:19] <frigglefroogle> multibounce can go off
[3:45:20] <Self_esteampunk> ff6 is so good
[3:45:21] <%Superbro64> ryu's shoryu super has a special animation and does more damage at low health in mvci
[3:45:22] <bbblaketwitching> I love you you crazy gremlin
[3:45:25] <%yeknomlive> ff6 is great
[3:45:25] <%mrjojothelion> that's good
[3:45:25] <frigglefroogle> you only do 1 damage
[3:45:29] <Taarin> Danger mario is for those who are super guarding everything in the game
[3:45:30] <bevyrage> i knew about it because i got into a real bad spot on the first playthrough and the ninja pulled off his low health limit break too
[3:45:31] <Am_Shigar00> I need to beat FF6 at some point.
[3:45:32] <+ShazBo2000> FF6 is only the greatest Final Fantasy
[3:45:35] <%ChoculaUltra> didn't all of Sabin's desperation moves also use fighting game inputs too? So you could fuck up majorly?
[3:45:36] <luckysteak> STONKS
[3:45:42] <jackarrow1> Pierce is more late game
[3:45:44] <+pectusumbra> good choice!

[3:47:09] <%ChoculaUltra> its a sync test for editting/recording
[3:47:11] <%SchwaAkari> I'm going to need to watch every single vod of this thing
[3:47:12] <thetntm> it's to help sync the audio recording
[3:47:15] <bbblaketwitching> That was a chunk of content
[3:47:19] <%Superbro64> is there even an authoritative body to enforce such rules?
[3:47:19] <%SchwaAkari> I can hardly believe this is being played here
[3:47:24] <missingangle> We didn't get to chapter 2 yet, guys? I joined like ten mins ago. Not complaining at all, though, it just means more Woolie streams :3
[3:47:27] <Jaller101514> nice season!
[3:47:27] <Cynical_Canadian> CHapter 2 is quite hefty
[3:47:31] <%SvenHolgersson> This is quite a hearty game
[3:47:33] <Jflaskd13> thx doodBro
[3:47:36] <%ChoculaUltra> @WoolieVersus please tell me you added the invadervie cod montage to the outro
[3:47:39] <+AsinPersuasion> he was side questin
[3:47:43] <Darren716> Well howlong to beat is normal time
[3:47:46] <Darren716> Not lp time
[3:47:47] <ultimatemegahero1> Is this going up on YouTube?
[3:47:47] <+QuadraticGravity> @WoolieVersus this is the biggest single dump of sidequests they hand you at the trouble center, if you're worried about LP
[3:47:49] <%Superbro64> post chapter side plots take a bit for sure
[3:47:52] <Calek> hope het gets quickswap next session
[3:47:53] <%SvenHolgersson> 30 hours at least
[3:47:56] <+GustusWarlock> god I cant wait for the slog that is glitzville
[3:48:04] <%SchwaAkari> Thanks for the awesome stream Woolz and Reggie <3
[3:48:07] <Papa_Bearman> This game is meaty. There's eight chapters.
[3:48:10] <%DatAsuna> @svenholgersson 30 hours is the mainline only time
[3:48:16] <thesickestzak> Just never stop playing. Reggie can't go home :)
[3:48:17] <nin10play> @GustusWarlock You take that back, Glitzville is the best
[3:48:19] <%DatAsuna> this way?
[3:48:20] <bbblaketwitching> this is going up after the kotor anime is over yeah?
[3:48:22] <+QuadraticGravity> After future chapters you only get like 3
[3:48:23] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieTRASH woolieDATTEBAYO_HF

[3:48:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:48:25] <%DatAsuna> probably 50 houra
[3:48:26] <missingangle> seems fair
[3:48:30] <bbblaketwitching> backlog
[3:48:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @QuadraticGravity Fucking hero
[3:48:31] <%Hawk_Rush> someone should let them know about the ??? sidequset
[3:48:33] <+pectusumbra> It's cause you get prologue and chapter 1 quests
[3:48:34] <shiny_prinny> there are longer and more complex sidequests, though
[3:48:36] <%Hawk_Rush> that should be done on stream
[3:48:42] <missingangle> If it helps, we wouldn't mind at all
[3:48:46] <Daveythe6thMoon> "Hit me, Mario!"
[3:48:49] <%SirGO0SE> do em on stream we love it <3
[3:48:56] <+QuadraticGravity> @CommanderSqueaks ive been lookin stuff up this whole time but just keeping it in for post-recording
[3:48:56] <gilgatwitcher> Nah, do em on stream.
[3:48:57] <bbblaketwitching> this has all been pretty great
[3:48:58] <shiny_prinny> either way it'sfun
[3:49:00] <%DukeBlack_> fuck the other guys
[3:49:01] <ashenjuan25> Reggie the consular?
[3:49:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't think anyone here had a problem with the side quests. Can't speak for the Anime audience, but the Manga audience loves it.
[3:49:06] <+Grayhammatter> do what you want my dude
[3:49:07] <%0ctaeder> will there be a lp where reggie will play the game?
[3:49:08] <%SirGO0SE> please us we want it all baby
[3:49:10] <%DatAsuna> i'm the latter
[3:49:10] <+greenfall> im for the side stuff
[3:49:13] <+TheRisingPride> you did 3 dumps worth of quests at once
[3:49:14] <missingangle> To be honest, TTYD fans have no problem because we just love more content
[3:49:14] <%krispen_wa> if all the sidequests are like those, it's fine
[3:49:15] <DragonSpooker> Nah this was a great sess
[3:49:16] <Bguy32> The next chapter is the worst one buts all up hill from there
[3:49:19] <sunnythedrunk> No the sidequests are awesome
[3:49:19] <+Loinclothiclese> SEE IT
[3:49:22] <%SvenHolgersson> DO ALL OF IT
[3:49:25] <%kyh9> Show it to us
[3:49:26] <nin10play> Fuck those other guys who said that wall is easy to notice
[3:49:26] <Solidnick18> it's fun i like it
[3:49:27] <%SvenHolgersson> 100% OR NOTHING
[3:49:29] <+QuadraticGravity> I'm mostly excited for you getting really into the battle system
[3:49:30] <GHouseduivel> We need to learn about CRIME port
[3:49:30] <Darren716> Do it all on stream, maybe cut for the lp?
[3:49:32] <%SvenHolgersson> BUT THAT GAME WAS STINKY
[3:49:32] <nyacoo> Definitely don't mind
[3:49:33] <+pectusumbra> Little Devil!

[3:49:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> this game is NOT Tokyo Mirage session.

[3:49:39] <%Chatterbox1991> NO DO IT THOUGH
[3:49:40] <%prime_name> #130000
[3:49:40] <%DukeBlack_> TMS is entirely different it's a game in Japanese
[3:49:41] <@Solidus_113> Double blind is a dangerous LP game
[3:49:42] <Megafang2145> Side stuff is good if you wanna do it
[3:49:43] <%iHum4n> I don't mind joining the 13000 again
[3:49:44] <skyheys> this game is actually good, so nobody minds
[3:49:44] <%KyoryUtchy> Has Woolie learned about The Pit of Bloody Palace yet?
[3:49:45] <%DatAsuna> yashiro's dad did nothing wrong
[3:49:45] <Solidnick18> as long as everyone like its
[3:49:46] <%SirGO0SE> 13000 gang
[3:49:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> #13000
[3:49:46] <Darren716> This game doesnt drag like TMS
[3:49:47] <Daveythe6thMoon> TTYD fans have been waiting for years for Nintendo to make another fun Paper Mario game. They know how to be patient!
[3:49:47] <phatmac16> #13000 FE

[3:49:49] <nin10play> Ok but I watched all of Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[3:49:51] <+QuadraticGravity> #13000FE
[3:49:53] <Poryizard> It’s fine to do it but your grind is slow in between

[3:50:00] <thesickestzak> The #13000
[3:50:01] <%SuperKirby24> #13000
[3:50:04] <DragonSpooker> Oof
[3:50:04] <Darren716> Woolie this game isnt a hardcore jrpg
[3:50:07] <ashenjuan25> Damn
[3:50:13] <Daveythe6thMoon> But hey Bug Fables exists so I can stop waiting!
[3:50:15] <+GustusWarlock> someone has made a kinda paper mario type game recently
[3:50:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game isn't even close to that much of a slog.
[3:50:19] <%Superbro64> believe me, I doubt ANYTHING in TTYD is as bad as it gets in #FE
[3:50:21] <+paladinstarbuster> MAMORI IS GONNA LOSE HER COOLS
[3:50:21] <Darren716> Like its a paper mario game, it aint too complex
[3:50:23] <sunnythedrunk> This game is nowhere close to that long at all
[3:50:23] <bbblaketwitching> what is #13000?
[3:50:25] <%Superbro64> EXCEPT THAT ONE BIT
[3:50:28] <%SirGO0SE> i real talked LOOOOVED the tms lp
[3:50:30] <+GustusWarlock> yeah what davey said
[3:50:34] <Cynical_Canadian> I agree with Woolie, as funny as the joke is, his channel isn't big enough for that
[3:50:34] <%Superbro64> THAT ONE BIT IN TTYD IS rough
[3:50:35] <CalliegulaStrems> I am a proud member of The 13000 FE
[3:50:35] <bbblaketwitching> also bug fables isn't thaaaat good
[3:50:36] <DatAsuna> #the13000FE
[3:50:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching The average number of views they had for each episode of it.
[3:50:40] <bbblaketwitching> its fiiiiine
[3:50:40] <+天使42199> Yeah thousand year door isnt anywhere near as long
[3:50:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> But Barry though
[3:50:44] <sunnythedrunk> TMS was one of the best LP's #13000
[3:50:44] <%ChoculaUltra> you want sidequests that leave you feeling drained and empty? Try Xenoblade Chronicles.
[3:50:45] <nin10play> Barry Goodman wants the new Mamori doll
[3:50:46] <+天使42199> thats not gonna happen woolie dont worry
[3:50:47] <bbblaketwitching> I see ty
[3:50:57] <@Solidus_113> Yakuza is the same way
[3:51:01] <Darren716> Woolie trust me theres no where near that much in TTYD
[3:51:03] <+pectusumbra> NEver forget The Tunnel Home
[3:51:05] <Cynical_Canadian> @ChoculaUltra Yeah, that one is ALL fetch quests
[3:51:06] <%DatAsuna> TMS has some great sideauest cutscenes
[3:51:15] <%SirGO0SE> this is paper mario though, people love it enough to watch anything it has
[3:51:21] <JetpackMcQuack> SeemsGood
[3:51:21] <vaderxyz1970> This game is not that though
[3:51:27] <%DatAsuna> if only some kind of asuna made an abridged version of the LP
[3:51:29] <Daveythe6thMoon> Either which way Bug Fables scratched an itch that hasn't been satisfied in years, that alone makes me happy.
[3:51:30] <+paladinstarbuster> Never forget "MY Comlex"
[3:51:32] <Rhinoprotoss> Paper Mario is actually a good game
[3:51:33] <ashenjuan25> Is there a best of on the channel?
[3:51:37] <%Disgrea> Basically as long as you dont go out of your way to fight every enemy in previous areas TTYD is not a slog
[3:51:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna If only.
[3:51:51] <Bguy32> No grinding necessary here
[3:51:57] <%ChoculaUltra> @Cynical_Canadian it doesn't help that literally 90% of them are just checklists from literal no-name npcs for the ENTIRE game
[3:51:59] <Daveythe6thMoon> Heck yeah, if Woolie hasn't played Paper Mario N64 that's a big recommend!
[3:52:04] <%DatAsuna> @commandersqueaks lowkey I hate that it got over 13000 views lol
[3:52:09] <GHouseduivel> It's Mario, not some anime bullshit though
[3:52:14] <+pectusumbra> It helps that Paper Mario doesn't need grinding and the battle system is active and fun
[3:52:16] <%SirGO0SE> yall been killing this LP so far it would take active work to scare people away lol
[3:52:26] <thesickestzak> Yeah you really don't need to grind. Just fight the enemies once on your first time through and you will be fine
[3:52:34] <missingangle> If that's what you wanna do, that's all good, Woolie. Your stream, dude!
[3:52:37] <Darren716> Trust me Woolie, you wont need to off screen really anything
[3:52:37] <%DatAsuna> grind is very unneeded
[3:52:57] <%SvenHolgersson> This game RULES
[3:52:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna That's not uncommon. I see a lot of compilation creators get uncomfortable when their compilation gets more than the actual LP.
[3:53:00] <+pectusumbra> Fun indeed
[3:53:01] <DragonSpooker> @woolieversus do you know about the Gundam Vs. Maxi Boost beta?
[3:53:03] <luckysteak> You guys are doing great!

[3:55:16] <%SirGO0SE> !throat at risk!
[3:55:16] <thesickestzak> That is something you could do off screen and if you think it is funny bring it up during the next session
[3:55:25] <SideChar> talk only to your favorite npcs
[3:55:26] <NevikGamina> or just screen cap it LUL

[3:55:53] <%DatAsuna> @illtima there's no need, there's no level grinding in ttyd, he just wants to see every sidequests dialogue

[3:56:04] <%AlphaTauri> it need origin
[3:56:05] <GHouseduivel> Yes.
[3:56:07] <NevikGamina> yeah but more eyeballs are on it since its on Steam
[3:56:08] <+aishman> Yeah you still have to use Origin
[3:56:10] <ashenjuan25> Titanfall 3 when?
[3:56:13] <%DatAsuna> siege is a similar deal

[3:58:13] <+CharredChord> horsetails
[3:58:15] <bbblaketwitching> horsetail
[3:58:15] <+pectusumbra> mushroom always gives stir fry, leaf gives tea, ect
[3:58:20] <+QuadraticGravity> she only ever fails if you give her wrong recipes, or 50% chance if you cook a mystery
[3:58:34] <@Menitta> YES AND ITS SICK AS FUCK
[3:58:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, you need a RECIPE BOOK for other items, like the Horsetail.
[3:58:53] <@Menitta> Its a team fighting game for sure
[3:59:00] <%ChoculaUltra> its still 2 v 2 iirc
[3:59:01] <%YakumoYomi> Extreme VS has been out in the West for a while, though.
[3:59:02] <thesickestzak> Always cook dried shrooms. Turns them into a mistake and that is better
[3:59:04] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Tonight the Titanfall 2 player base was around 10k when I got off 20 minutes ago. Dude it felt so good only having to wait a minute at most for a match.
[3:59:05] <Giothegame> I mean it is a part of Anime EVO
[3:59:15] <Daveythe6thMoon> It's good, he'll figure it out. Besides it's gonna be a while before he gets to the area with the cookbook, let alone the quest that nets him it.
[3:59:18] <%DensityD> I'M STILL SEEING KOOPS BOBBING REFLECTION
[3:59:28] <@Menitta> @YakumoYomi Extreme Vs hasn't been. Just Gundam Vs on PS4 which is a terrible version of the Vs games
