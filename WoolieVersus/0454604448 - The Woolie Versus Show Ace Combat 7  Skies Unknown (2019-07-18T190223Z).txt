[0:16:31] <Slam_Punk> Unless you go into the dragons lair
[0:16:37] <Predatorhahaha23000> emotions is a myth, it is just your brain following a programming to react a way.
[0:16:47] <Laironx3> A ghost pilots the brain
[0:16:48] <reonome> the myth is in the logic/creativity split
[0:16:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> How Can Our Brains Be Real When Our Eyes Arent?

[0:40:49] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus It's poorly defined, but "expert" is Normal mode
[0:40:50] <worldbrand> The difference is that you have to roll in order to make real turns
[0:40:51] <xdeathknightx> Should be playing it on big dick mode, not games journalist mode Kappa
[0:40:52] <Fujiwara_92> LUL

[0:44:14] <%TubeMan642> TubeMan642 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Do a barrel roll!
[0:44:16] <arikk42> big planes - 3 rocks.... jets - 2 rocks
[0:44:21] <Halospaz117> Clouds are absolutely a gameplay mechanic
[0:44:21] <Owkono> they renamed the modes, used to benormal mode and novice mode
[0:44:22] <+mayorrev> does this game have flight stick controls?
[0:44:25] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:44:28] <+mayorrev> sick
[0:44:35] <pshuuu> hold B when shooting a missile, it will look nice
[0:44:36] <Halospaz117> Also if you want to level out your plane, press both bumbpers
[0:44:40] <resloxxx> Become speed incarnate
[0:44:45] <$SWFanatic> clouds are surprise mechanisms
[0:44:48] <jbrooksdev> Woolie, Do a highG when you overshoot and then just roll the target when in range. its that simple.
[0:44:53] <%SilvaChariot0133> SourPls
[0:44:54] <+MechaBaphomet> always fire 2 missles
[0:44:55] <fugnuggets01> Kreygasm the music

[0:45:23] <wulfsbane_jolt> double tap is a good idea
[0:45:30] <FairOnFire> that's not a real barrel roll
[0:45:31] <%wolfofsound> continuous barrel rolls!
[0:45:34] <+mayorrev> PULL UP
[0:45:36] <Halospaz117> There is no eject
[0:45:36] <+Ocorena> mission 14 is going to be rough on woolie
[0:45:37] <+Shaggnar> That's an aileron roll , not a barrel roll Kappa
[0:45:40] <+EndgameContent> You wanna hold back-left/right and yaw
[0:45:46] <Halospaz117> No blacking out
[0:45:54] <@Solidus_113> There isn't a blackout mechanic, but your plane can stall
[0:45:56] <$SWFanatic> ALT = ALTITUDE. When its zero ya dead
[0:45:57] <+EndgameContent> Really handy for dodging missiles without changing direction
[0:46:00] <+Ocorena> you stall if you go too slow/high
[0:46:40] <arkv01> humans were not made for the skies
[0:46:43] <arikk42> Hold the Rocket Button for a long time

[0:46:52] <pan_nochal> don't worry about stalling too much, you can easily recover from it unless you're really close to the ground

[0:47:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED HIGH EXPECTATIONS
[0:47:25] <reonome> you need perfect vision

[0:47:28] <+Shaggnar> 20/20 or correctable to 20/20
[0:47:31] <+Bad1uck> @woolieversus So each aircraft has a normal cruise speed that happens without applying speed or brake. Most of the time you'll want to zoom fast by holding down RT/R2. When you get behind a target and lock on you'll want to hold the brakes a bit with LT/L2 to get more time behind the target
[0:47:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> GOOD
[0:47:39] <Halospaz117> Woolie, if you hold down the Y button, the camera will focus on whatever you are targeting

[0:49:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pretty much ALWAYS hold Y
[0:49:09] <jbrooksdev> @WoolieVersus when that giant circle around the reticel shows up, it means youre in gun range and can press a to rip them up without using missles.

[0:50:07] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:50:14] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Clap
[0:50:20] <Halospaz117> Also general rule of thumb, most planes take 2 standard missles, so it's probably best to fire 2 when you got a shot
[0:50:34] <pan_nochal> @coreybom yeah, I was fucking awesome from the get-go :)
[0:50:34] <laguerrilha> Isnt backseating, is co-piloting :v

[0:51:47] <@Solidus_113> Click the right stick
[0:51:48] <wulfsbane_jolt> NOW DO IT AGAIN
[0:51:49] <Halospaz117> Right stick to swap view, but yeah I prefer third person
[0:51:50] <fugnuggets01> Now do it good
[0:51:53] <jbrooksdev> okay no more tips. hes learned everything he needs to know
[0:51:55] <Haarute> this is CONTENT woolie.
[0:51:56] <+Dull_Fangs> Oh this is going to be good
[0:51:59] <+Shaggnar> You get the sick cockpit view though
[0:52:02] <resloxxx> Click the right stick The view is great
[0:52:03] <SirDogBear> perfect!
[0:52:05] <+Dull_Fangs> Don’t its harder
[0:52:23] <resloxxx> you can always change it back
[0:52:23] <+RoughyID> @WoolieVersus tll woolie that you can fire two shots at once
[0:52:26] <+Dull_Fangs> Also does woolie know about holding triangle
[0:52:31] <Laironx3> muh caah
[0:52:39] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus It's always good to double-tap the missiles. Almost all planes take 2 shots to down
[0:52:39] <Halospaz117> This game also has a VR campaign on PS4 where you play as the Ace Combat 04 protagonist
[0:52:41] <Ion_Laser> @Dull_Fangs yeah
[0:52:47] <+Dull_Fangs> Thank the lord
[0:52:47] <Cool_Guy45> VR mission for AC7 is the best VR experience i've ever had. You HAVE to try them
[0:52:52] <laguerrilha> mah car, the fealiing of tha leather!
[0:52:56] <+Bad1uck> Virtual cockpit is the way to go
[0:53:03] <%wolfofsound> FUCKING luv cahs
[0:53:05] <DatAsuna> Full cockpit view is very nice to look at
[0:53:05] <CurrySauseBandit> @WoolieVersus The first person in this is top notch tbh
[0:53:10] <+Dull_Fangs> Does he know about high g turns
[0:53:13] <+RoughyID> Mobius 1 roo7
[0:53:17] <DatAsuna> Especially the DLC planes with the camera canopy
[0:53:18] <pan_nochal> yeah, first person is the best way to get S
[0:53:18] <SirDogBear> nice guy reggie knowing woolie needed more practice without overtly backseating
[0:53:22] <%Gogogolem> Third person is basically cheating so woolie likes it.
[0:53:25] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @13sin
[0:53:27] <$SWFanatic> ooo
[0:53:38] <+Dull_Fangs> As someone who did the campaign through FP 3rd is waaaay easier
[0:53:44] <millamoks> We cant share clip links? dang
[0:53:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:53:58] <$SWFanatic> easy isn't for woolie
[0:54:00] <+Dull_Fangs> Oh god can you imagine him doing mission 14 in first person
[0:54:20] <wulfsbane_jolt> Wait, Minh is colorblind right? How does this HUD look?
[0:54:21] <pshuuu> which one is 14 again?
[0:54:22] <@Solidus_113> 1st person mode actually has more on-screen information than 3rd person does
[0:54:29] <Halospaz117> You can see how many missles you currently have loaded in the lower right
[0:54:34] <+Bad1uck> @dull_fangs is that the tunnel one?
[0:54:35] <arikk42> if you like Synth Rock music and fast UI play AC2 if you like Ghost in the Shell and Evangelion play AC3 if you like the Plot play AC4 if you like goofy shit play AC5 if you like Gameplay play AC Zero
[0:54:36] <SirDogBear> if he can make it to mission 14, mission 8 might cause woolie to break his controller
[0:54:37] <+Javaa01> Isn't 14 the storm?
[0:54:38] <+Dull_Fangs> Yep
[0:55:03] <%Gogogolem> woolie what the hell are you talking about?
[0:55:08] <+Dull_Fangs> Someone make sure this man gets an A-10 asap
[0:55:09] <resloxxx> This game has cloud physics it can ice your cockpit, in first person its pure beauty
[0:55:23] <$SWFanatic> hes trying to say he likes watching himself
[0:55:30] <+Dull_Fangs> He doesn’t anymore?
[0:55:52] <resloxxx> press A to use the Machine Gun
[0:55:54] <Halospaz117> Guns are the A button
[0:55:55] <@Solidus_113> Guns are on A
[0:56:03] <+Shaggnar> In an arcade game the gauges don't matter. In a proper flight sim you actually need those
[0:56:13] <$SWFanatic> Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
[0:56:13] <+Javaa01> Woolie needs to try going through cloud formations in first person when he's not in active combat
[0:56:17] <Halospaz117> When the reticle pops up on screen is when you are in gun range
[0:56:19] <+Dull_Fangs> The gauges actually work in this one
[0:56:23] <@Solidus_113> now use the right stick to look around the cockpit
[0:56:26] <+TheSaintJohn> Ye Woolie Stream!!!
[0:56:29] <wulfsbane_jolt> HE SAID MY NAME
[0:56:30] <resloxxx> Oof
[0:56:37] <wulfsbane_jolt> big yay
[0:56:38] <reonome> ouch
[0:56:50] <FairOnFire> use the altimeter
[0:57:15] <pshuuu> you mean the altifooter
[0:57:16] <+Dull_Fangs> I wish someone gave him that AC beginners playlist bf this
[0:57:18] <+Shaggnar> You can look around the cockpit for that maximum immersion
[0:57:18] <%wolfofsound> first person view? More like first plane view
[0:57:21] <Halospaz117> Does he need ass balm?
[0:57:26] <$SWFanatic> brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[0:57:30] <Halospaz117> Guns are good at close range
[0:57:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> nah
[0:57:35] <+Dull_Fangs> God the japanisms in this game
[0:57:36] <pan_nochal> I use the right stick to manually look behind the plane during a dogfight instead of relying on triangle, but I dunno
[0:57:37] <%SilvaChariot0133> Guns to apatDab
[0:57:37] <CurrySauseBandit> Nope, just gotta get good and use the guns
[0:57:38] <%steelmorrigan> Guns are also good for "herding"
[0:57:38] <+EndgameContent> Guns are for fighting slippery craft
[0:57:44] <arikk42> Woolie if those planes get to the island this will be Mission Failed
[0:57:46] <@Solidus_113> You'll almost never run out of regular missiles, you get a comical amount
[0:57:59] <+Javaa01> The guns are for strafing targets, and tagging targets that are too fast to lock on
[0:57:59] <Halospaz117> It varies from game to game
[0:58:10] <reonome> yeah you're not the girl
[0:58:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> Trigger is Trigger
[0:58:13] <+Shaggnar> 5 and zero not so much. Both are silent protagonists though
[0:58:13] <Halospaz117> The player is you
[0:58:14] <Bust_ER> You're Trigger
[0:58:14] <reonome> you're you
[0:58:16] <fugnuggets01> You're Trigger
[0:58:16] <+Dull_Fangs> 6 is the WORST bu far
[0:58:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> Trigger is You
[0:58:17] <%steelmorrigan> you are not the girl
[0:58:17] <pan_nochal> just Trigger
[0:58:19] <resloxxx> Trigger is (You)
[0:58:21] <$SWFanatic> apatJpeg
[0:58:21] <%SkaiVibration> You're never the girl
[0:58:23] <%steelmorrigan> You're Trigger
[0:58:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> baba is you

[0:58:29] <wulfsbane_jolt> You are studio TRIGGER
[0:58:33] <TigerClaws12> trigger is you
[0:58:33] <+Dull_Fangs> Trigger the GOAT
[0:58:34] <JanusII> Trigger doesn't like that.
[0:58:35] <laguerrilha> Baba is Trigger
[0:58:36] <arikk42> You Are WOOLIE !
[0:58:38] <worldbrand> You're Trigger and you're the biggest badass on this side of the planet, you cool fucker
[0:58:46] <+tux789> what plane is he flying?
[0:58:47] <$SWFanatic> YOU is MAGE
[0:58:51] <Halospaz117> Guns actually do good damage if you keep em on target
[0:58:55] <%wolfofsound> but if me is trigger.......
[0:58:58] <TigerClaws12> F4
[0:59:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Burn them all
[0:59:02] <+cicatjb> i remember one from the perspective of a kid playing a harmonica in bar listening to pilots, then theres a deathstar level in the end
[0:59:05] <+EndgameContent> Your'e that one guy from Titanfall 2
[0:59:11] <+Shaggnar> Need to wait for the gun sight to appear
[0:59:15] <Halospaz117> You need to wait for the reticle to be on screen to be in gun range
[0:59:22] <resloxxx> GUN is unlimited in easier difficulties
[0:59:22] <Halospaz117> Guns are unlimited on this difficulty
[0:59:23] <pshuuu> Gun is infinite on norma ldifficulty
[0:59:23] <FairOnFire> ramge is very short on the guns
[0:59:23] <+Javaa01> These are very easy targets, it's the Vergil squad you need to watch out for, you will not get lock on them
[0:59:25] <pan_nochal> unlimited ammo for the gun on this difficulty
[0:59:26] <wulfsbane_jolt> Jack Cooper
[0:59:33] <+Shaggnar> Gun is unlimited on this difficulty
[0:59:33] <+Dull_Fangs> Jesus why didn’t we give him the F-16
[0:59:33] <@Solidus_113> That circle is the gun marker
[0:59:33] <%steelmorrigan> MG has ulimited
[0:59:33] <%Solidnick18> Viper
[0:59:38] <wulfsbane_jolt> AKA John Titanfall
[0:59:41] <+Dull_Fangs> Wait is he on easy
[0:59:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> You get a module later that lets the guns auto-track for you
[0:59:48] <SirDogBear> the quickest way for woolie to git gud is to use the a-10 as much as possible especially for dogfighting
[0:59:53] <arikk42> Hurry Woolie

[1:00:09] <wulfsbane_jolt> L3 + R3
[1:00:10] <+Bad1uck> lol chafe
[1:00:12] <+Javaa01> You have Flares
[1:00:12] <arikk42> R3 +L3
[1:00:12] <+Shaggnar> Flr
[1:00:13] <BlueMoonBlues> You dont need it
[1:00:14] <resloxxx> click both sticks
[1:00:14] <reonome> chafe???
[1:00:15] <Cool_Guy45> push down both sticks for flare + chaff
[1:00:15] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus Also, the reticle leads the target for you, so to hit you just need to keep the reticle on them
[1:00:16] <+Bad1uck> L3 and R3
[1:00:16] <%steelmorrigan> both sticks
[1:00:18] <%SockNinja013> Press L3 and R3
[1:00:23] <TigerClaws12> click two sticks
[1:00:23] <fugnuggets01> L3 + R3 for flares
[1:00:25] <+tux789> i see that russian qc is well represented in this game
[1:00:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> yes
[1:00:27] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you have 6 Flares, marked by FLR on your screen
[1:00:28] <Halospaz117> Also, it's chaff, not chafe
[1:00:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> or jsut dodge
[1:00:32] <+MidnightBurst12> nope
[1:00:33] <wulfsbane_jolt> Or DODGE
[1:00:35] <+MechaBaphomet> just dodge
[1:00:36] <pshuuu> click both sticks in
[1:00:36] <arikk42> TIme !
[1:00:36] <FairOnFire> flares not chaff. you've got limited
[1:00:36] <Kongro_> Oh hey, one of my favorite 2019 games
[1:00:36] <BlueMoonBlues> Yeah but you wont always have flares
[1:00:37] <worldbrand> Woolie's right but we're making fun of his pronunciation
[1:00:40] <@Solidus_113> Ace Combat is VERY much an Arcade dogfighting game
[1:00:45] <+EndgameContent> Flares are super limited
[1:00:45] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:00:48] <pan_nochal> there's eighteen thousand Su-27 variations in this
[1:00:52] <wulfsbane_jolt> listen to Mr.Piccolo
[1:00:54] <+Bad1uck> Yes it's for missiles on you, and they are flares in this case
[1:00:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> Flare is if you're hyperfucked and can't dodge in time
[1:01:00] <arikk42> Woolie the bomber is close
[1:01:06] <+Javaa01> Flares is how you deal with them, Chaff is for Metal Gear Solid bullshit future missiles that aren't thermal targetting
[1:01:11] <worldbrand> You currently have 6 flares (FLR)
[1:01:12] <BlueMoonBlues> Learning to dodge is the most important thing
[1:01:16] <+jcenderion> FOR BELKA
[1:01:36] <Halospaz117> This is also the first main game with flares in it, so you were always expected to dodge before
[1:01:50] <+Bad1uck> @javaa01 Chaff is for radar guided missiles, flares are Infra-red guided missles
[1:01:50] <+MechaBaphomet> that camera is going to kill him
[1:01:52] <TigerClaws12> AC6 has flares @halospaz117

[1:02:38] <Prevot> I'm sure they will get past the tutorial someday
[1:02:38] <resloxxx> To finish the missions faster you can just focus on the TGT (Targets)
[1:02:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatBig Fast
[1:02:44] <+Javaa01> @Bad1uck Yeah, but woolie is thinking of MGS future missiles that have optical targetting
[1:02:49] <pshuuu> nah no vtol
[1:02:51] <+Bad1uck> Reggie is the real saboteur in this storyline @woolieversus
[1:02:52] <+korth367> wait a minute, this isnt koihime
[1:02:56] <%Solidnick18> oof
[1:03:07] <$SWFanatic> apatJpeg PJSalt
[1:03:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> Guns takes getting used to
[1:03:13] <arikk42> Drop Bellow 500 mph R3 + L3 and pull up to do Hyper Combo RKO on another plane
[1:03:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> this is the tutorial??? NotLikeThis
[1:03:24] <+Bad1uck> @javaa01 you mean the stinger missile?
[1:03:24] <%wolfofsound> "while you were studying the missile I was studying the wing"
[1:03:28] <wulfsbane_jolt> novice mode won't make this easier
[1:03:30] <%Solidnick18> gonna learn today
[1:03:41] <wulfsbane_jolt> ironically
[1:03:44] <resloxxx> @arikk42 Only with planes that are able to PSM this isn't one of them
[1:03:46] <+EndgameContent> Isn't this the guy who beat the Ace Combat 7 tutorial LIVE ON STREAM?
[1:03:47] <SirDogBear> aiming with missiles become easier once you learn how to quick turn
[1:03:54] <$SWFanatic> lol
[1:04:04] <@Solidus_113> As you learn, you should fire and forget the missiles, their tracking is pretty good if you're tailing right behind the target. Have some faith that they'll hit, you don't need to watch them connect
[1:04:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> Tap Y
[1:04:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> Need to change target
[1:04:13] <Cool_Guy45> you need to change your target guy
[1:04:18] <pan_nochal> slow down when you approach targets
[1:04:20] <Kongro_> This is only as tough as it is because Woolie's only got the starter plane
[1:04:21] <pan_nochal> L1
[1:04:27] <Cool_Guy45> flashing box is your target
[1:04:38] <Kongro_> Number go up, difficulty go down
[1:04:41] <%EustaceDeCroix> i got the flight stick for this and it makes it even more fun I thought. Overall I loved this one.
[1:04:47] <pshuuu> if he continues, magic spear will be podcast outro guaranteed
[1:04:47] <resloxxx> To finish the missions faster you can just focus on the TGT (Targets)
[1:04:56] <Halospaz117> Next is the target you'll lock onto when you press Y
[1:05:00] <TigerClaws12> @halospaz117 oh yeah, you only had ECM in the F18, mb. I was thinking of Hawx
[1:05:00] <+mayorrev> I was away for a bit did he do the big thing
[1:05:11] <arikk42> OMG HE DIDN'T SAID MY name
[1:05:11] <resloxxx> To finish the missions faster you can just focus on the RED TGT (Targets)
[1:05:29] <+Javaa01> @Bad1uck No, the MGS future missiles have cameras integrated in them which means the only way to drop them is via EMP disruption
[1:05:40] <Halospaz117> @TigerClaws12 Yeah I can understand getting that mixed up. Assault Horizon also had flares, but it was Assault Horizon so it doesn't count
[1:05:48] <@Solidus_113> stall
[1:05:50] <SirDogBear> yea most of the time i think i only failed missions by not getting to objective on time or crashing trying to get akward targets not actually getting shot down
[1:06:09] <arikk42> D Storyed
[1:06:09] <+TheSaintJohn> SASM (Smart Air Surface Missle)?
[1:06:19] <Halospaz117> I don't think there is friendly fire, but I've never really tried
[1:06:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> Callsign
[1:06:40] <reiju_22> music Kreygasm
[1:06:43] <Halospaz117> Nah, I think the pilots are the ones that come up with the callsings
[1:06:46] <+EndgameContent> You can friendly fire in certain missions
[1:06:50] <Prevot> he got a verified twitter account, that's why
[1:06:50] <resloxxx> SASM explode near the enemy plane if they manage to dodge
[1:06:52] <Halospaz117> So he likely did something to get the name
[1:06:54] <Cool_Guy45> protip, critical mission info is told in the comms. It's pretty important that you pay attention to them
[1:06:55] <+Shotgundam009> 🤡
[1:06:59] <@Solidus_113> Short-Range Aerial Suppression Air-to-Air Missile (SASM)
[1:07:00] <TigerClaws12> Short-Range Aerial Suppression Air-to-Air Missile
[1:07:00] <pshuuu> real life callsigns are real goofy
[1:07:02] <hassanico1> oh what, this isn't koihime enbu
[1:07:02] <arikk42> does anyone remember Hot Shots ?
[1:07:08] <+TheSaintJohn> neat
[1:07:19] <+mayorrev> CHAPS MY ASS
[1:07:22] <+EndgameContent> You're clown now
[1:07:23] <hassanico1> I only ever saw Hot Shots Part Deux
[1:07:27] <resloxxx> SASM explode near the enemy plane if they manage to dodge
[1:07:39] <pan_nochal> Solo Wing Pixy is the best name
[1:07:48] <+mayorrev> MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
[1:07:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:07:51] <arikk42> Hot Shots is Top Gun and Ace Combat gags
[1:07:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> 2km is range for standard missile
[1:08:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> SO can just floor it until you get to that
[1:08:00] <@Solidus_113> Clouds will mess up your targeting
[1:08:02] <pshuuu> clouds screw with missile tracking
[1:08:08] <Cool_Guy45> clouds mess with radar lock
[1:08:16] <hassanico1> this still the tutorial?
[1:08:20] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:08:20] <TigerClaws12> metric for flying WutFace
[1:08:23] <fugnuggets01> Nice
[1:08:23] <@Solidus_113> attempt #3
[1:08:28] <+mayorrev> nice shot
[1:08:29] <Owkono> ace combat 5 would be a fun one too, your callsign is blaze
[1:08:30] <+Bad1uck> @javaa01 oh, which game was that in? Optical camouflage exists in the MGS universe so that seems like a solid countermeasure
[1:08:33] <wulfsbane_jolt> @hassanico1 yep
[1:08:39] <Alzero83> Yo Woolie alzeroBloodstained
[1:08:45] <+mayorrev> SPACE ELEVATOR
[1:08:46] <hassanico1> Ah seeing Brownie makes me feel bad
[1:08:46] <masterfire23> will you do the vr missions?
[1:08:56] <Halospaz117> Oh yeah locking the camera on the target while in first person is limited by how the pilot would be able to move their head
[1:09:00] <pshuuu> this isnt PS4, so theres no vr
[1:09:05] <+EndgameContent> You actually feel more immersed when you can see your character
[1:09:08] <Halospaz117> So third person is objectively better in that respect
[1:09:10] <hassanico1> the main theme is soooo good
[1:09:18] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus focus on just the red targets, you don't have to down all the planes
[1:09:18] <arikk42> Woolie one Special Rocket is Enough
[1:09:24] <+EndgameContent> Because you have something to project onto that isn't just a floating pair of hands or a wobbling gun
[1:09:29] <hassanico1> First person should be reserved for tunnels and intense tight sections I feel
[1:09:33] <+Javaa01> @Bad1uck MGS4 and MGR, it's why Boris is surprised about the plane in the beginning of MGR having flares, because the technology in that world is beyond thermal targetting
[1:09:36] <TigerClaws12> no access to VR because project Ace are a bunch of shitters LUL
[1:09:42] <resloxxx> @WoolieVersus SASM explode near the enemy plane if they manage to dodge
[1:09:43] <+Tiewolf> Yo woolies I just found out that you can play Super Galdelic Hour on twitch
[1:09:54] <+Bad1uck> Also optical target matching is used by cruise missiles since their original target selection is usually done via recon satellite anyways
[1:10:02] <FairOnFire> clouds can also ice your controls
[1:10:10] <Prevot> monkaS
[1:10:11] <hassanico1> Do Reggie and Minh have experience with this?
[1:10:15] <laguerrilha> Clap
[1:10:19] <+mayorrev> ez
[1:10:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> Now don't slam into the ground this time yeah?
[1:10:25] <pan_nochal> R2 + L2 for auto pilot
[1:10:26] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus If you press both bumpers, you'll engage the autopilot and level out the plane
[1:10:26] <laguerrilha> First try
[1:10:28] <hassanico1> "MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE" we gonna be hearing that a lot
[1:10:31] <+mayorrev> sortie my fortie
[1:10:34] <+TheSaintJohn> bossman
[1:10:35] <arikk42> R2 + L2 is for evading rockets and dog fighting
[1:10:35] <Cool_Guy45> "warning" means enemy is targeting you. Red HUD means they've fired
[1:10:44] <@Solidus_113> click all your buttons while the mission is ending BTW
[1:10:52] <@Solidus_113> learn what they do
[1:10:53] <wulfsbane_jolt> @woolieversus I have to go, but I really hope you come to love this game as I do. Give it your best Woolie!
[1:11:01] <hassanico1> Everything about this game is so good
[1:11:23] <+mayorrev> I love how they're not paying attention to the intricate story
[1:11:23] <+Shaggnar> VR isn't as good for flight games IMO. resolution is bad so it makes finding targets hard. Head tracking is where it's at
[1:11:24] <+Bad1uck> @javaa01 ah that's neat, I always wondered why he was surprised by flares being used
[1:11:35] <hassanico1> aw shit really? The cutscenes are the best part about this
[1:11:35] <@Solidus_113> It's the full mission
[1:11:39] <worldbrand> this little flyby map is fun to watch though

[1:12:56] <pan_nochal> but mission 3 is cooler

[1:13:22] <%Solidnick18> YE
[1:13:22] <+Bad1uck> @solidus_113 Only way that's happening is not following Reggie's advice >.<

[1:14:51] <Halospaz117> Honestly, most of the contries on the Usean continent are kinda their own thing and not really based off of real countries, that more started in AC5 where they went beyond the Usean continent
[1:14:54] <+mayorrev> and Erusia = EU

[1:24:05] <Angry_Ev1L> at least do 4
[1:24:06] <pshuuu> 3 is the one with drone plane, right?

[1:29:25] <reonome> or 80s
[1:29:32] <arikk42> 30s

[1:34:48] <arikk42> Woolie play Jagged Alliance 2 maybe
[1:34:55] <Ion_Laser> A Quiet Place is really good
[1:35:00] <MatTrix77> I don't know what Docotr Sleep is
[1:35:03] <DatAsuna> Yeah but using an old name makes people talk about your bad thing
[1:35:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> American History X-2
[1:35:10] <Dr_Mooose> creativity is scary
[1:35:11] <Dovakhin573> But theres is a shining sequel
[1:35:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dont create original thing, make more nostalgia wanks
[1:35:26] <+cvp5127> but brand recognition
[1:35:32] <Ion_Laser> @MatTrix77 That's the name of The Shining sequel
[1:35:34] <+zaxitor> Space Invaders the Movie
[1:35:41] <Ion_Laser> Tetris the Movie
[1:35:45] <Justin_Wood> Don't create original thing, just consume nostalgia and get excited for next nostalgia
[1:35:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Back to the Future Reboot is going to happen and you all refuse to face taht truth
[1:35:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:36:04] <$SWFanatic> Rampage 2: Revenge of the CGI

[1:36:36] <@Menitta> Speaking of, new Top Gun looks p good
[1:36:51] <DatAsuna> >quality aside lol
[1:36:57] <+Nomicro4u> >writing aside
[1:36:58] <+Rodzzila> I don't think they don't have faith or won't take a risk. Is the fact that they really don't need to when just making a live action of a old movie make you millions
[1:37:01] <Justin_Wood> @Menitta o/
[1:37:08] <%SkaiVibration> facts
[1:37:09] <+Bad1uck> Studios look at movies as financial risks. Shit like Justice League made money despite being terrible due to star power and overseas markets that didn't know any better
[1:37:12] <laguerrilha> After Last Jedi i stopped caring about Star Wars
[1:37:30] <Justin_Wood> Are we finally doing Backstroke of the West cast?
[1:37:32] <+Nomicro4u> It could have worked if they actually had a good script
[1:37:41] <@Menitta> Everyone watch Backstroke of the west
[1:37:43] <$SWFanatic> yeah, but they still threw in mark hamill and harrison ford and billy dee williams
[1:37:58] <MatTrix77> Carpenter
[1:38:01] <UnknownGerm> He was carpenter
[1:38:02] <%wolfofsound> prop builder
[1:38:06] <$SWFanatic> american graffitti, star wars, raiders
[1:38:06] <+Nomicro4u> I honestly wish they didn't throw Hamill in just to ruin his character
[1:38:06] <Justin_Wood> Game time started
[1:38:09] <DatAsuna> just like the jesus
[1:38:11] <+Bad1uck> Star Wars were unknowns at the time of filming
[1:38:15] <@Menitta> Oh I feel far from good
[1:38:46] <Ion_Laser> I think Peter Cushing was the only established actor for the original trilogy
[1:38:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> !wipeouts
[1:39:01] <Justin_Wood> Mr. Speaker, we can never compromise to black.
[1:39:02] <%SkaiVibration> liam neeson
[1:39:03] <UnknownGerm> He had gotten an oscar nomination before he was in star wars, no?
[1:39:03] <%Shishi1205> Ewan

[1:39:05] <katocrimson> liam nesson
[1:39:07] <+Bad1uck> @nomicro4u Hamill hated the storyline and script but was obligated to be part of it
[1:39:21] <+cvp5127> taken man
[1:39:29] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus John Wayne started as a prop boy then extra
[1:39:29] <+Nomicro4u> BUT IT SUBVERTED MY EXPECTATIONS

[1:43:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> already being scrubbed LUL
[1:43:20] <Ion_Laser> Start the Counter!!!
[1:43:22] <+Bad1uck> F
[1:43:28] <%FeelinNifty> It's ALWAYS Beef Chungus
[1:43:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Big Chungus always wins
[1:43:30] <worldbrand> Both
[1:43:31] <+Dull_Fangs> Why do this
[1:43:33] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Both
[1:43:34] <+Bad1uck> Speed is life
[1:43:35] <%SkaiVibration> either
[1:43:36] <%FeelinNifty> It has always BEEN Beef Chungus
[1:43:37] <Halospaz117> Kinda varies depending on the situation
[1:43:37] <+Nomicro4u> BARREL ROLL
[1:43:40] <@Solidus_113> you want to use the high-g turn
[1:43:43] <pshuuu> you need to slow down to turn, but speed up when you're perpendicular
[1:43:45] <reiju_22> did woolie even get to play LUL
[1:43:48] <$SWFanatic> faster you go the bigger the circle
[1:43:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Gonna die in 3 2 1
[1:43:53] <+Nomicro4u> EVADE WOOLIE
[1:43:53] <fugnuggets01> MISSILE
[1:44:09] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> smaller
[1:44:13] <arkv01> log off
[1:44:14] <%FeelinNifty> You duck
[1:44:14] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus I'll try spinning, that's a good trick!
[1:44:14] <@Solidus_113> L2 R2 high-g turn
[1:44:15] <arikk42> R3 + L3
[1:44:15] <Halospaz117> Sharp turns
[1:44:15] <+Dull_Fangs> If your doing a loop turn in both the y and z axises
[1:44:19] <worldbrand> Pick a god and pray
[1:44:29] <+Javaa01> The answer is to slow down for a tight turn, and immediately accelerate out of the turn
[1:44:30] <IntrepidEye> high g turns but need to keep speed up
[1:44:32] <arikk42> R2 + L2
[1:45:02] <arkv01> do it for the empire, woolie
[1:45:13] <arkv01> the emperor will sing your praises
[1:45:16] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:45:17] <$SWFanatic> caution ground
[1:45:24] <Ion_Laser> Oh boy...
[1:45:31] <@Solidus_113> no more flares
[1:45:32] <+Nomicro4u> missle. missle. missle.
[1:45:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Missile Missile Missile Missile
[1:45:34] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus if you move in a serpentine pattern the person aiming at you will be traveling a shorter line and will overtake you, dumping you straight into your sights
[1:45:44] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus Just so you know, since you set the cost limit to unlimited, you are going up against guys in endgame planes while you are in a starter
[1:45:44] <pshuuu> go into the clouds
[1:45:50] <+AmanDotZip> ^^^ @Halospaz117
[1:45:53] <fugnuggets01> Run into the clouds
[1:45:58] <Prevot> who's the best dog in gaming? "missile. missile. missile."
[1:46:03] <+Nomicro4u> Hey you're not last!
[1:46:08] <$SWFanatic> you're not just evading missles, you're evading the pilot shooting them
[1:46:09] <arkv01> yeah I figured woolie is outplaned right now
[1:46:35] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:46:35] <@Menitta> This game is actually hard to play in multiplayer
[1:46:35] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> yeah
[1:46:36] <+Dull_Fangs> Bruh I wish he’d play goast trick
[1:46:41] <Halospaz117> They are just better in pretty much every way
[1:46:42] <pmtriox> they don't take more hits, they' can just turn on a dime
[1:46:43] <pshuuu> they have slightly more health, about 1 missile worth
[1:46:49] <+Javaa01> They're faster, stronger and better steering compared to your basic bitch plane
[1:46:50] <+Nomicro4u> Everything you can do they can do better
[1:46:52] <fugnuggets01> salty johns
[1:46:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Accepted johns
[1:47:07] <+Nomicro4u> Plane johns
[1:47:14] <$SWFanatic> apatJpeg PJSalt
[1:47:16] <pmtriox> no it's inherently the planes
[1:47:16] <@Solidus_113> There's a whole custom parts aspect to the game where you can change stats and improve beyond what the plane can normally do
[1:47:22] <%SkaiVibration> The only ppl that play ac online are rlly good..
[1:47:42] <arkv01> @Solidnick18 that sounds like MAGIC cheating PJSalt
[1:47:43] <+Nomicro4u> basically airplane nerds
[1:47:45] <%wolfofsound> oh man I love that Kanye West song
[1:47:47] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> They're objectively better in every way.
[1:47:58] <laguerrilha> i never touched the multiplayer in any Ace Combat.
[1:48:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 8TH
[1:48:03] <$SWFanatic> You didn't kill the ground. Thats a win in my book.
[1:48:04] <fugnuggets01> 8th lul
[1:48:06] <pmtriox> get an F22 is the lesson
[1:48:07] <+Nomicro4u> You can only go up from here!

[1:51:20] <Ion_Laser> @drabberfaun535 yeah
[1:51:21] <@Menitta> Oooooh thats why
[1:51:23] <@Menitta> lmao
[1:51:26] <Halospaz117> So yeah right now you have the most basic plane with absolutely no parts equiped
[1:51:32] <pmtriox> you can customize in hangar
[1:51:37] <CatsEyeBlind> It was greyed out because he had readied
[1:51:39] <%badmr7> Hangar
[1:51:39] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> In the hanger
[1:51:40] <Justin_Wood> @WoolieVersus Hangar
[1:51:41] <Halospaz117> You can customize in the hanger
[1:51:41] <IntrepidEye> You can but you haven't unlocked anything yet.
[1:51:43] <$SWFanatic> beef chungus mvp
[1:51:44] <worldbrand> oh they're on the same team
[1:51:57] <pmtriox> chungus is your homeboy

[1:52:04] <Dr_Mooose> time to hard carry
[1:52:04] <rockethed1> RAZGRIZ
[1:52:06] <Halospaz117> YEAH RAZGRIZ
[1:52:07] <SirDogBear> yea 2000 limit doesnt necessarily mean it will be easier, in fact you might face people with more optimized customs for their cheap planes like a-10s
[1:52:07] <%heyitsbrian> YEYEYEY
[1:52:08] <pmtriox> phantom jeez
[1:52:12] <worldbrand> carrying makes us stronger
[1:52:14] <@Solidus_113> To the clouds!
[1:52:17] <worldbrand> i bet beef chungus can lift
[1:52:17] <@Menitta> this is the best map
[1:52:17] <Halospaz117> Health varies
[1:52:19] <@Solidus_113> 2 should be good
[1:52:23] <Ion_Laser> Ride the lightning!
[1:52:43] <worldbrand> PogChamp chungus
[1:52:48] <pmtriox> if you're at a right angle to the missle you won't need flares
[1:52:51] <$SWFanatic> oh god
[1:52:54] <+Dull_Fangs> Lmao
[1:52:59] <@Menitta> Woolie knows that pressing decelerate and accelerate allows for shorter turns right?
[1:53:00] <worldbrand> YEAAAAAH

[1:53:31] <Halospaz117> Is this operation bunker shot playing in the background?
[1:53:39] <Halospaz117> High-Gs do make you stall faster
[1:53:41] <pmtriox> certain planes cannot do it, keep in mind
[1:53:41] <@Solidus_113> You don't want to hold you goof. it's 2 second taps
[1:53:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> cant even last 30 seconds LUL
[1:53:42] <pshuuu> you can't hold it, the high-g turn only works for a couple seconds
[1:53:46] <+Nomicro4u> If you hold the G turn you slow your speed down making you an easier target
[1:53:50] <worldbrand> much like armored core, this is one of those games you can play without really looking at what's onscreen. everything you're tracking is offscreen
[1:54:02] <+Javaa01> This mans really doing backflips
[1:54:16] <pmtriox> the sweet spot is 600 speed
[1:54:22] <+Dull_Fangs> ^
[1:54:22] <Halospaz117> Also, the music playing during multiplayer is songs from other ace combat games
[1:54:25] <+ElectricFoxLex> Remember look at your map to see where the missles are going to g turn
[1:54:32] <@Menitta> Yeye

[1:54:38] <$SWFanatic> woo
[1:54:39] <+Dull_Fangs> When’s Zero
[1:54:39] <Halospaz117> HE GOT ONE
[1:54:39] <%wolfofsound> not carried!
[1:54:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PRO
[1:54:41] <Kriss1827> NICE
[1:54:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HES PRO NOW
[1:54:43] <%SkaiVibration> YEE
[1:54:44] <+spindash77> Did he run into the first "boss" yet
[1:54:45] <$SWFanatic> oh god
[1:54:46] <EuropantLamprey> He got a kill! MORAL VICTORY
[1:54:49] <SirDogBear> just turn at full speed and you should be okay for a while its lame going in a circile but its safe
[1:54:52] <@Menitta> I want him to get hit by lightning so bad
[1:54:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:54:55] <worldbrand> JUST DO IT PERFECT
[1:54:57] <Ion_Laser> :D
[1:54:57] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[1:54:58] <reonome> he's in multiplayer
[1:55:00] <$SWFanatic> do everything better
[1:55:03] <arkv01> try to become A GOD
[1:55:05] <@Solidus_113> Also, you don't always need to hold down acceleration
[1:55:16] <pshuuu> now i want afull LP of this
[1:55:19] <pmtriox> get used to switching targets rapidly, you'll need to
[1:55:25] <IntrepidEye> being in the clouds screws up missile locks
[1:55:29] <%wolfofsound> incoming
[1:55:30] <@Solidus_113> Justin's doing the flips LUL
[1:55:33] <Halospaz117> Don't forget you can lock the camera on the target
[1:55:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "im trying to not die" - man who died
[1:55:44] <pmtriox> if you hold the target button i'tll look at it
[1:55:50] <SirDogBear> for his first time in multiplayer with barely any playing time woolie doing well though
[1:55:53] <reonome> holy shit
[1:55:54] <rosemon5001> your allways at deaths door when your dog fighting
[1:55:58] <$SWFanatic> eject
[1:56:00] <%wolfofsound> F
[1:56:07] <CatsEyeBlind> Yeah he survived for a pretty long time there
[1:56:08] <pmtriox> brake war is how
[1:56:10] <@Solidus_113> slow down and high-G
[1:56:11] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Do turns better
[1:56:20] <Halospaz117> Honestly, it's sorta a thing you get a feel for, so it's hard to really explain
[1:56:22] <SomersaultJustice> use the Wii U gamepad Kappa
[1:56:26] <pshuuu> go into clouds, go around obstacles, rely on teammate
[1:56:31] <OverlordEgg> If you hold down the change target button the camera will follow who you're targetting
[1:57:02] <SirDogBear> it also depends on your customs too some people have so much tracking and lock on they have normal missiles and qaams flying around enemies for hours
[1:57:11] <%gatorafan> missile missile NotLikeThis
[1:57:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:57:13] <Halospaz117> This is pretty much how I feel when I play fighting games
[1:57:15] <@Menitta> YOU WON
[1:57:16] <pmtriox> ignore the missile warning noice and pay more attention to the angle it's coming at you
[1:57:16] <%wolfofsound> just parry the missiles
[1:57:18] <IntrepidEye> its something that comes with experience. probably should've played through part of the campaign to get a feel for it
[1:57:20] <%johnny_gogo> Im beef i tryed im sorry woole @WoolieVersus
[1:57:25] <Cool_Guy45> good fight woolie!
[1:57:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Beef Chungus wors for no one but himself
[1:57:33] <$SWFanatic> beef chungus did great
[1:57:35] <+Nomicro4u> Chungus more like Smallgus
[1:57:39] <worldbrand> @johnny_gogo you did your best i'm still proud of you
[1:57:43] <@Menitta> good job @Justin_Wood
[1:57:44] <ValidVenasaur> WOW Woolie even my unborn kid could do this blindfolded in his sleep
[1:57:49] <Justin_Wood> Thanks :D
[1:57:55] <Prevot> big hard
[1:57:55] <@Solidus_113> Let's see the Space Elevator stage
[1:57:57] <+Nomicro4u> YOU GONNA LEARN TODAY
[1:57:59] <Halospaz117> Might wanna go into the hanger and see what you can do
[1:58:04] <DatAsuna> Difficulty very not good
[1:58:04] <arkv01> @johnny_gogo good beef, good beef
[1:58:05] <$SWFanatic> Today was a reminder
[1:58:05] <pmtriox> you really shouldn't be going multiplayer first
[1:58:10] <TriadOrion> It's like stepping into a new fighting game, isn't it?
[1:58:12] <rosemon5001> have you actually done the story mode to atleast learn the ropes?
[1:58:12] <%steelmorrigan> yeah MP is brutal
[1:58:13] <worldbrand> that's what you get for playing with killers
[1:58:16] <HUNTERX2X> Ace Combat 7 multiplayer is one of the hardest multiplayers u can ever play. no time for rest
[1:58:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> this is how fighting games feel for most people, Woolie
[1:58:21] <Halospaz117> Yeah even as someone who has played these games forever, multiplayer can still kick my ass
[1:58:24] <stevo_scar> how's it going?
[1:58:25] <%SkaiVibration> doodOne doodOne doodOne
[1:58:25] <SirDogBear> use the a-10 woolie show people you have no fear!
[1:58:29] <Kyrill_PSN> Is he on eggbog?
[1:58:29] <Halospaz117> Mostly because the other guys have ALSO been playing forever
[1:58:32] <Strider222> you also have the f4
[1:58:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:58:35] <%gatorafan> Woolie's road to Ace Combat EVO champion begins Kappa
[1:58:46] <rockethed1> Go hangar
[1:58:46] <Halospaz117> YEP, THAT'S THE FEELING
[1:58:53] <MetroAndroid> I've given up on ever being good at fighting games, everyone else is 30 years ahead of me
[1:58:55] <+Shaggnar> How do I turn is like how do I combo
[1:58:55] <+Nomicro4u> Feels like some pro player spamming 1 attack on you while telling you that you gonna learn today
[1:58:56] <pmtriox> fog
[1:59:17] <+Dull_Fangs> Low rocks now
[1:59:19] <Justin_Wood> _I'm bad too Woolie, that's the secret_
[1:59:29] <Prevot> PogChamp
[1:59:32] <+Shotgundam009> Here we go
[1:59:37] <$SWFanatic> the Hero arrives
[1:59:38] <pmtriox> f16 is solid
[1:59:38] <worldbrand> The campaign makes you feel like a badass but the AI just really never measures up to other players
[1:59:39] <Halospaz117> F-16
[1:59:50] <%gatorafan> comfy arcade feeling of being surrounded by metaphorical and literal killers Kappa
[1:59:57] <CatsEyeBlind> Inb4 Minh prefers to play without inverting controls
[2:00:02] <@Solidus_113> Click the right stick to change camera
[2:00:03] <+Dull_Fangs> Ace mode enemies aren’t shit compared to multiplayer
[2:00:10] <pmtriox> cockpit camera superior camera
[2:00:14] <$SWFanatic> That time when Minh took the controls and saved the stream. I can't believe he shot everyone out of the sky so easily. Amazing.
[2:00:16] <DatAsuna> feel free to blame me if u lose xD
[2:00:17] <CAPSLOCKlive> be bold be fast, Ace Combat 7 is great! Very fun story campaing too
[2:00:20] <IntrepidEye> they are actually going easy on him. I don't think anyone used lasers railguns or QAAM on him yet
[2:00:26] <Halospaz117> YEAH YOU GOT RAZGRIZ WITH YA
[2:00:40] <CAPSLOCKlive> Also, Ace Combat 7 in Vr is pretty damn fun
[2:00:40] <worldbrand> he set a cost limit as well so they probably dont get access to the lasers
[2:00:51] <HUNTERX2X> was that a hit?
[2:00:53] <rockethed1> Breaking Arrows is that you?
[2:00:57] <%gatorafan> I still can't believe Minh murdered everyone like a hero.
[2:00:58] <Strider222> you can
[2:00:59] <@Solidus_113> you can
[2:01:03] <%SkaiVibration> CAN
[2:01:03] <Kyrill_PSN> Too bad they arent on PS4. Would join their squad 8)
[2:01:05] <pmtriox> you can see on radar as a line
[2:01:06] <Halospaz117> Missles are absolutely on the map
[2:01:06] <@Solidus_113> it's a very small white marker
[2:01:07] <worldbrand> PogChamp
[2:01:10] <+Nomicro4u> DESTROY THE CHUNGUS
[2:01:12] <HUNTERX2X> oh damn woolie good hit
[2:01:17] <rosemon5001> you can its just a little gray ish line
[2:01:20] <+Dull_Fangs> Man if woolie knew about AC4 he’d prob think an event in the later half of the game was the hypest shit
[2:01:25] <pshuuu> jousted
[2:01:26] <SirDogBear> I think there is a cheap mig with lasers under 2000 but thats only if you want to style
[2:01:31] <%badmr7> you can change how far away the minimap zooms out
[2:01:36] <worldbrand> GET THE KILL MINH
[2:01:39] <HUNTERX2X> disengage
[2:01:40] <Strider222> the white line on the radar thats following you is the missle
[2:01:41] <+Nomicro4u> WHERES THE BEEF
[2:01:43] <$SWFanatic> get the dick
[2:01:44] <+Dull_Fangs> Btw anyone know what game this song is from
[2:01:53] <pmtriox> if missiles are coming at you on a right angle, you won't need flares
[2:01:56] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus There is actually a good reason to go after better people, because people who are higher on the leaderboard give more points if you shoot them down
[2:02:08] <Halospaz117> You can tell by how many stars are by their name
[2:02:10] <%gatorafan> wow Minh totally carried his team to victory like a champ PogChamp
[2:02:15] <+Nomicro4u> Chungus destroyed
[2:02:19] <worldbrand> means someone else killed your target and you got a hit on him
[2:02:20] <SirDogBear> ^ even a hit against a 3 star would get you mondo points
[2:02:27] <pshuuu> everyone just circling LUL
[2:02:39] <CAPSLOCKlive> Slow down to turn, pick up speed to chase. Break fast to dodge
[2:02:40] <+PapermanXD> I think he’s in an F14 the folding wings look like one
[2:02:41] <+Dull_Fangs> H I G H. L E V E L. P L A Y.
[2:02:57] <pshuuu> someone guide minh into a the tunnels
[2:03:02] <pmtriox> clouds will throw off missiles too
[2:03:21] <+Nomicro4u> He doin it
[2:03:24] <worldbrand> It's probably a different value though?
[2:03:26] <Halospaz117> Mihn's doing pretty good actually
[2:03:43] <rosemon5001> do it for JPEG dog
[2:03:48] <worldbrand> he got a very clean shot on chungus earlier
[2:03:48] <SirDogBear> hes doing what he needs to, stay in a circle
[2:03:54] <$SWFanatic> apatBig apatJpeg
[2:04:00] <%gatorafan> all that practice on the 3rd birthday is paying off PogChamp
[2:04:02] <CAPSLOCKlive> You have 58 missiles and 1 minute on the match... use them. Pop 1, count to 2, pop 2
[2:04:03] <%EustaceDeCroix> EustaceDeCroix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Woolz! Thanks for 7 months of awesomeness & thanks for always making tough days easier man.
[2:04:03] <@Solidus_113> get that spacing
[2:04:12] <Halospaz117> Yeah it is very much a game of trying to find the perfect moment
[2:04:12] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:04:21] <+Dull_Fangs> Tbf spacing is a thing here
[2:04:23] <worldbrand> if you're circling each other you can break the cycle by helping your allies and hopefully they'll help you too
[2:04:25] <pmtriox> best fighting analogy i can give you is that everything you're doing at all times is offense, it just doesn't look it
[2:04:29] <pshuuu> chun vs chun, 2 supers
[2:04:36] <arikk42> Woolie play the whole series using your Qanba Obsidian like i did, YOU COWARD !!!
[2:04:45] <her0_89> Oh shit, Im finally able to make it to a live woolievs
[2:04:45] <+Dull_Fangs> You gotta put your self out there for offense to happen
[2:04:46] <SirDogBear> going around in a circle is the basic form of ace combat footsies
[2:04:55] <reonome> LUL
[2:05:04] <+Nomicro4u> Showing belly BM
[2:05:04] <pshuuu> LAAM, sniped from outside

[2:05:06] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:05:08] <%gatorafan> rip the survivor streak FeelsBadMan
[2:05:12] <Kyrill_PSN> You also can fly like an infinity symbol and rotate to get behind them, but so far pretty good :)
[2:05:17] <Belutima> what you can do is, go in a straight line, bait it out, then turn back when you can see the entire battle field of planes
[2:05:23] <%GlewmanIII> GlewmanIII subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! howdy folks

[2:05:42] <Halospaz117> Of course the guy in the Razgriz skin was the MVP
[2:05:43] <Justin_Wood> Ye
[2:05:44] <Justin_Wood> First place
[2:05:44] <her0_89> Yo, I played this in VR mode at a con once. Let me tell you, that was an experience.

[2:05:46] <linklol321> hes fucking good
[2:05:50] <DatAsuna> I'll take it

[2:06:27] <reonome> @ozzrabbit you're a little late on that
[2:06:27] <+Nomicro4u> Minh did pretty good
[2:06:28] <Kyrill_PSN> Damn im late... too bad
[2:06:32] <+Shaggnar> It's like the baby mdoe of sims too LUL
[2:06:33] <Halospaz117> Yeah I can imagine it can be pretty hard if you are not experience in the genre
[2:06:34] <HUNTERX2X> the VR Woolie, the VR Kreygasm
[2:06:37] <pmtriox> just do campaign it's the best tutorial
[2:06:37] <worldbrand> i'd say it's a good split of sim and arcade
[2:06:39] <CAPSLOCKlive> Feels good to drown on ace combat man
[2:06:45] <+Javaa01> Nah, this ain't even seen the deep end, the deep end is past a 5k$ flight sim rig
[2:06:47] <+theturtlebar> I kind of want to see Woolie drown in an old school Janes Combat Sim game
[2:07:01] <%ozzrabbit> @reonome I know. I’ve been at work all day and just checked my news feed.
[2:07:05] <Halospaz117> Like, I've been playing ever since I was a kid with Ace Combat 6, so most of this stuff is just second nature to me
[2:07:08] <+Nomicro4u> suuuuuuuuuuure
[2:07:10] <rockethed1> You oughta play AC Zero Buddy

[2:07:36] <HUNTERX2X> did woolie play the campaign?
[2:07:39] <+Nomicro4u> Everyone knows you get stronger if you have something to protect
[2:07:50] <worldbrand> @HUNTERX2X he got to mission 2 and the game crashed

[2:07:54] <Halospaz117> IT'S SO COOL
[2:07:56] <Kyrill_PSN> Hope he plays it again
[2:08:00] <%johnny_gogo> I havent gottem to play like any Multiplayer that was really fun playing against players after beating the story on hard
[2:08:04] <CrimsonGargoyle> ace combat is metal gear in the sky, don't @ me
[2:08:04] <HUNTERX2X> @worldbrand ace combat can crash? wow didn't know

[2:08:17] <Cool_Guy45> if you every need tips about this game, let me know
[2:08:18] <pmtriox> dude, you have no idea. Ace Combat is the shallow end of flight games
[2:08:18] <HUNTERX2X> @CrimsonGargoyle story-wise, u ain't lyin
[2:08:23] <+cvp5127> like fighting games
[2:08:24] <rosemon5001> basically the first time anyone knew plays CTR
[2:08:30] <worldbrand> Getting shot at is just a symptom of you not shooting your enemy
[2:08:30] <rosemon5001> new*
[2:08:31] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus that's an actual special missile you can get
[2:08:42] <stevo_scar> gotta find your medium punch

[2:08:58] <Kyrill_PSN> its all about spacing man
[2:09:04] <Justin_Wood> Like anyone who thinks I'm any good based on my score, _I am very much not the example of the best aces in multiplayer_
[2:09:04] <HUNTERX2X> SeemsGood

[2:17:16] <arkv01> jojo killed woolie vs D:
[2:17:17] <+Parrish_broadnax> 3rd Birthday had everyone leave
[2:17:22] <DatAsuna> That's unfortunately real, don't let it set in.
[2:17:23] <JDebss> I still love seeing woolie's fear face in the sbf logo
[2:17:34] <ManlyMcBeefington> @woolieversus are you going to upload a highlight for the Teppen discussion from the podcast?
[2:17:35] <@Menitta> Its either 3rd Birthday or 18 DMC5 episodes
[2:17:37] <MetroAndroid> Wait, was that video about that JoJo fighting game a joke? I assumed it was terrible for years, never played it.
[2:17:39] <+karldeck> Existential nightmare Woolie
[2:17:40] <Nina96> iam still subed to channels that have been dead for years
[2:17:42] <reonome> sbfpScared
[2:17:49] <Belutima> he said, no and unsubbed evoMindBlown
[2:17:51] <+StrawberryPantsu> The best who's?
[2:18:03] <Nina96> best what?
[2:18:04] <arkv01> requires you to... put out a bit more...
[2:18:14] <+RowenCleric> how it used to be BibleThump BibleThump
[2:18:17] <arkv01> show a lil more skin, woolie... and minh...
[2:18:18] <Kyrill_PSN> *cough DMC2
[2:18:23] <JDebss> @reonome True fear
[2:18:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:18:27] <+karldeck> @Nina96 I was subbed to a channel that didn't upload in 6 years and then came out back doing regular video
[2:18:47] <ScarletCyclone> Yeah but DMC2 was a good joke tho.
[2:18:54] <+Parrish_broadnax> Im glad that youpicked up Streaming
[2:18:55] <+Nomicro4u> Diversify platforms
[2:19:00] <Kyrill_PSN> it was -perfection- :D
[2:19:01] <+cvp5127> rip jojo
[2:19:02] <%Gogogolem> Woolie i'll remain subed forever so i can throw puns at you
[2:19:16] <Nina96> 3rd birthday was a mistake
[2:19:33] <DatAsuna> A choice with no regrets
[2:19:38] <Belutima> one suggestion is, if it ends up not popular, instead of just ending it. make a highlight of the end, instead of posting full playtroughs, just to end it.
[2:19:43] <+shivhappy22> AC7? That new top gun trailer get you that hard?
[2:19:50] <JDebss> Judge eyeslp?
[2:19:59] <Kyrill_PSN> I'm still subbed to everyone... just not on twitch cuz im a pleb
[2:20:07] <ScarletCyclone> Mystical Ninja was a fun LP.
[2:20:08] <+Nomicro4u> IMHO just keep consistent, even if an LP is doing poorly it can always do a 180 and do a face turn.
[2:20:18] <MetroAndroid> This is my first time watching/listening to any of the SBF again since the breakup after I had watched for many years
[2:20:22] <Haarute> @Belutima that would mean spending all the time of recording for like no content.
[2:20:23] <wummzy> Reggie/Wools is the new TBF. I will be with you guys to the end. Like every video even if I don't watch it.
[2:20:27] <DatAsuna> Then people get angry about missing stuff
[2:20:32] <DatAsuna> also it takes more time in editing
[2:20:39] <DatAsuna> so the highlight reel comes out later
[2:20:47] <%rytyoung> I tried making it through FF Sessions, but at the time I wasnt into any smt or FE games
[2:20:48] <cherrycottontail> When a game becomes dead, why not stream the remainder?
[2:20:48] <+cvp5127> just youtube it Kappa
[2:20:50] <+Nomicro4u> Most LPers hire editors to put together a "best of/higlights" of LP series
[2:21:08] <%wolfofsound> nothing wastes time like trying to save time
[2:21:22] <reonome> UNSUBBED
[2:21:32] <arikk42> MVC 1
[2:21:37] <$SWFanatic> poor super bunny hop
[2:21:38] <DatAsuna> This is why we don't unsub from bunnyhop anymore
[2:21:40] <Nina96> unsubbed from super bunny hop
[2:21:46] <+Baekon01> I really love going back and watching compilation videos of the lps. Helps make the whole lp way more digestable
[2:21:59] <wummzy> I unsubbed after Marvel but Bayo brought me back
[2:22:03] <wummzy> XD
[2:22:10] <DatAsuna> I should really just standardize my usernames
[2:22:21] <worldbrand> nice
[2:22:23] <Kyrill_PSN> The Demon's Souls stream was pure bliss. Had so much fun watching that
[2:22:29] <ScarletCyclone> Unsubbed from Exceptional Rodent Acrobatics.
[2:22:29] <DatAsuna> It's dumb that I have a different name between Twitch/Steam/Discord/Twitter
[2:22:30] <%rytyoung> Bunny needs all the subs since he's a one man band
[2:22:59] <+Parrish_broadnax> I really wanna see you play more judgement
[2:23:01] <DatAsuna> Souls games in general are better for stream than LP
[2:23:04] <JDebss> 3/2!
[2:23:08] <MetroAndroid> LP Highlights are the jumpcuts of Let's Plays
[2:23:11] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus when will you play Monster Girl Island: Prologue. it's free
[2:23:17] <MetroAndroid> ^
[2:23:20] <DatAsuna> Resident evil is goo for stream too, despite the chat spoilers
