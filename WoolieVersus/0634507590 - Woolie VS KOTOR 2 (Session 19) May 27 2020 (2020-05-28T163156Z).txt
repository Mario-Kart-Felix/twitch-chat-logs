[0:27:13] <%RioGascar> i wonder if V is sweating from the heat in that robe. its getting hot this week
[0:27:14] <%Valask> started 80s and ended 90s
[0:27:15] <+wunp_fxs> Its on VRV!
[0:27:20] <muniea3> p... places
[0:27:21] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> yar
[0:27:22] <+BigDumBeak> ITS ON VRV NOW
[0:27:26] <%jiggy_snipe> the anime started late 80s I mean
[0:27:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ah yes...ACQUIRE yohohoho
[0:27:44] <Joestar1890> I'm sure Woolie's apartment is cool enough
[0:27:53] <+kewlmyc> They Canadian, I'm pretty sure they don't have vrv
[0:28:00] <$Invlux> nobody knows how to torrent things any more NotLikeThis
[0:28:19] <%RioGascar> i think people just dont want to
[0:28:28] <%RioGascar> if you make it easy to get product
[0:28:32] <Djinnazz> it's super essy
[0:28:32] <+dragonzord12> i have the same issue with over hype with xenoblade 1, it's a good game but they seriously over hyped by calling it a masterpiece
[0:28:32] <%jiggy_snipe> yea I don't really want to download stuff
[0:28:37] <%RioGascar> why go through the hassle of torrents
[0:28:40] <%Irridium> so fun fact there's actually a YouTube playlist with every episode. or there was a month ago. think it's still around
[0:28:44] <KaitlynnHere> And viruses
[0:28:48] <DatAsuna> Not just original designs though, they'll even trace over fanart of movie designs
[0:29:20] <+wunp_fxs> Lucas had good art directing suprisingly.....and good designers
[0:29:43] <%RioGascar> they also look very cool
[0:29:47] <%chll0ne> agreed
[0:30:02] <KaitlynnHere> People are free to talk shit about George Lucas but you have to agree how amazing Lucas Arts was
[0:30:30] <penitentpentwitch> Star Wars, a Cosmic Horror Story where both sides are manipulated by self-serving bacteria that spreads itself across the galaxy via their hosts conflict, ensuring that civilization never advances past its current point.
[0:30:36] <%RioGascar> I think my favorite ship in the original movies is the return of the jedi giant long piercing ship
[0:30:46] <nothuzad> thats much more Ralph McQuarrie work than lucas' wunp_fxs
[0:30:52] <%RioGascar> that blows up on the 2nd death star by like ramming into it
[0:31:01] <%Ashenik1> Star wars is fantasy, not sci fi
[0:31:10] <%jiggy_snipe> yea
[0:31:12] <+SolidusRex> You could argue the prequel era ships are those flashy looking cars from the 50s
[0:31:16] <penitentpentwitch> Space Fantasy
[0:31:25] <nothuzad> it is
[0:31:28] <lotharrio> Well they wanted to just make a slight prequel to the prequel trilogy. But were told to throw back a thousand years to not mess with Lucas.
[0:31:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> Sci Fan
[0:31:29] <$Fortunato5678> It's both
[0:31:31] <%CyanDeadEye> Pre-KoTOR Old Republic era asthetic was very different
[0:31:31] <abelincoln_catpuncher> it totally is
[0:31:32] <StarlitStunner> The Kotor comics are very different from the aesthetic of the games
[0:31:32] <%royb2> space fantasy
[0:31:36] <abelincoln_catpuncher> space fantasy
[0:31:37] <%jiggy_snipe> it's space fantasy
[0:31:40] <+Xalgar> It's Fantasy, WHEN JEDI ARE INVOVLED
[0:31:42] <kwilanna> space opera
[0:31:45] <KaitlynnHere> Where’s the science Woolie?
[0:31:46] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:32:00] <+ZoltanBMagnus> The jedi totally operate on scientific terms
[0:32:00] <notenoughgirls> in kotor 1 carth talks about swords making a comeback bc of energy shields
[0:32:01] <Joestar1890> I think the OT ship designs and such look less refined, because the planets we visit in the movies are in outer rim, remote, or unpopulated
[0:32:04] <shincadad> !uptime
[0:32:04] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 43 minutes and 29 seconds
[0:32:06] <+Feralspirit41> its fantasy with scifi elements
[0:32:07] <Djinnazz> Space Western.
[0:32:09] <%RioGascar> star wars doesnt have to get technical with all of its ships and technology
[0:32:10] <Doodle_Taco> Soft Sci-Fi if you want to get techinichal
[0:32:11] <+SolidusRex> A fantasy based on spacality
[0:32:11] <%illicitdonut> Its a fantasy story with sci-fi trappings
[0:32:13] <abelincoln_catpuncher> LMAO not new star trek
[0:32:15] <+kewlmyc> there's no science involved with Star Wars
[0:32:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> Star trek is fantasy as well
[0:32:17] <Joestar1890> Also the rebellion isn't exactly the richest military
[0:32:18] <lotharrio> I dunno man, there's a lot of gods in Star Trek.
[0:32:22] <%caffienatedjedi> Soft Sci-Fi with Fantasy
[0:32:29] <%Ashenik1> Its fantasy with that takes place in space
[0:32:30] <%chll0ne> it’s mostly fantasy
[0:32:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> Star trek and star wars is SOFT sci fi
[0:32:33] <%kyh9> Future Fantasy: Fantasy with space aesthetic
[0:32:45] <+serpenttucker> It would be like a fantasy setting where a wizard is explaining how his magical ritual works
[0:32:50] <+RJay80> man i love the bada bah PogChamp
[0:32:50] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Its a science-fiction about "what if" religion mattered more than a metaphysical level
[0:32:52] <+serpenttucker> and how it would make sense within the setting
[0:33:01] <lotharrio> Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica..
[0:33:05] <%RioGascar> however
[0:33:09] <penitentpentwitch> Midiclorians
[0:33:09] <%hoenhime344> exactly!!!!
[0:33:10] <%jiggy_snipe> ...lol
[0:33:10] <notenoughgirls> did they watch the replay of kreia attacking t3 during the break
[0:33:11] <+kewlmyc> THE WISPS
[0:33:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> MIDICHLORIANS
[0:33:18] <%jiggy_snipe> never explain anything
[0:33:22] <KaitlynnHere> It breaks apart
[0:33:23] <%jillpilled> It was ALL the Wills!
[0:33:28] <%RioGascar> i have a phantom menance book that I remember does explain the hyperdrive AND TAKE THE THING APART
[0:33:28] <%hoenhime344> "movw by faith not by sight"
[0:33:35] <%hoenhime344> move**
[0:33:37] <+kewlmyc> Oh, Wills, my bad
[0:33:38] <+SolidusRex> Are the Whispers actually the Whills?
[0:33:41] <%RioGascar> Like a mechanical illustration
[0:33:44] <%correctedsun117> IT JUST WORKS
[0:33:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> When Starwars did the Hyperspace kamakaze they fucked themselves because that is the best manuver
[0:33:51] <+MidnightBurst12> And most of them are trash
[0:33:52] <KaitlynnHere> It started with no explanation, so it’s really hard to slip it in after the fact
[0:33:54] <lotharrio> You can have a unicorn. That's fine. Don't need to explain it.
[0:33:58] <+SolidusRex> Time jannies = Midichlorians?
[0:33:59] <%hoenhime344> aboot
[0:34:03] <%hoenhime344> heh heg
[0:34:06] <Doodle_Taco> KOTOR is the one that does it best imo
[0:34:10] <%RioGascar> i think the only thing you have to explain is something that is new to the world
[0:34:17] <lotharrio> The kamikaze was the biggest, coolest looking mistake, they ever did.
[0:34:21] <+serpenttucker> I mean is a series like this gonna go on as long without SOMEONE trying to explain the force?
[0:34:24] <%chll0ne> dont explain the magic
[0:34:25] <%RioGascar> like hey the death star, just show how it works and what it does
[0:34:27] <debrv> And THAT is why I love Warhammer 40K.
[0:34:30] <StarlitStunner> I prefer the force with Zayne Carrick where it has a personality and goals
[0:34:31] <%Gruhunchously> One in a million chance
[0:34:38] <+Urgoslav> The guiding omnipotent factor and the whatever it's just energy in matter

[0:43:14] <%gatorafan> T3 carried that meditation
[0:43:18] <Dangerzone979> Maybe the Exile taught it to her?
[0:43:35] <Deadbulky> Late to the party
[0:43:35] <DatAsuna> It's older than bastilla, but she was just a prodigy that could do it inherently without practice
[0:43:44] <%HostilePoundcakes> wow what a hero
[0:43:50] <%jillpilled> Kavar being a dirty glory stealer
[0:43:57] <+SolidusRex> Battle Meditation was not that obscenely rare, it's just that Bastila's skill at using it to influence with entire armies that made her special
[0:43:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> To be fair, Battle Meditation seems like a natural offshoot of your Influencer power.
[0:44:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Bastilla's master taught her and she was the only one trained in such in the order. but Kreia had the technique as well
[0:44:05] <+BlockingDisabled> I think it's more that she is just REALLY good at that particular ability

[0:51:15] <Dangerzone979> Why is the game letting you try and bend over backwards to save this guy?
[0:51:18] <$Fortunato5678> I mean, there are trials for real life war criminals. That seems the most logical.
[0:51:21] <+AsinPersuasion> 0 belief in greater things

[0:51:52] <%RioGascar> what does it matter what a bystander jedi is wanting to do in a situation they should not have authority in
[0:51:54] <%kyh9> "It's the queen's decision""I want to kill her""Okay" Game: Wait no
[0:51:55] <%jiggy_snipe> but giving someone a 2nd change is asinine

[1:00:19] <KaitlynnHere> I have witnesses, men
[1:00:22] <DatAsuna> And she's still objectively wrong
[1:00:25] <%Ashenik1> like witcher
[1:00:25] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> oops lol
[1:00:30] <%CursedNobleman> the neutral path huh, tell my wife. Hello
[1:00:33] <sekainoowaride> Shout outs to Alpha Protocol
[1:00:33] <$TheFabledAble> ala legend of the galactic heroes OBERSTEIN. THE OG. OBERSTEIN DID NOTHING WROOOONG
[1:00:45] <%RioGascar> Politics get messy and often have super unforeseen consequences that are widespread
[1:00:46] <+AjaxFoamingCleanser> @dorpork also, the lack of a trial undermines the queen's legal authority
[1:00:47] <sekainoowaride> Amazing politics in that game
[1:00:56] <AnacondaVirtue> That's not how that works, Woolie
[1:00:57] <+AjaxFoamingCleanser> that's all that line was trying to urge
[1:00:58] <+AsinPersuasion> I truly think Woolie will miss the point of the conclave
[1:01:02] <DatAsuna> the one where he blew up the courthouse
[1:01:03] <%therabbles> he surrendered when weapons went down
[1:01:05] <DatAsuna> and killed cops
[1:01:09] <derap41> The Guy said he would do it again
[1:01:10] <Thepothero> she tottally won

[1:01:12] <KaitlynnHere> No guys
[1:01:12] <+evbites> i hate heroes that go every life is sacred
[1:01:21] <Deadbulky> Totally won
[1:01:23] <KaitlynnHere> He was scared
[1:01:28] <derap41> This is like that Goofy Court sketch
[1:01:31] <notenoughgirls> im pretty sure they mean nuremberg type trial
[1:01:34] <derap41> I'll fucking do it again
[1:01:34] <debrv> You mean the weapons that were STILL SMOKING.
[1:01:34] <%jiggy_snipe> I mean like I said terrorists, mass murderers and war criminals do get trials if they don't die
[1:01:35] <KaiserMario> Maybe when he started to call out that if he got arrested he would escape because he has too many allies
[1:01:38] <%CEGold> Woolie did nothing wrong cmonBruh
[1:01:41] <%RioGascar> he challenged her to an agni kai and lost soooooo
[1:01:42] <+AsinPersuasion> Be the bigger man
[1:01:50] <%jinking79> sounds fair
[1:01:51] <%jiggy_snipe> that doesn't mean redemption tho
[1:01:52] <megamonmon123> man woolie is pulling a griffith right now
[1:01:52] <+deviljhojho_> He was the bigger man, he won because of that
[1:01:53] <Djinnazz> Or you can die in the room.
[1:02:01] <Deadbulky> Plus you are an outsider on this planet, why would you be trying to tell them how to resolve their confilict
[1:02:02] <megamonmon123> lol
[1:02:03] <$Fortunato5678> You saw Kreia, he could have been

[1:02:34] <derap41> He said he would do it again
[1:02:38] <megamonmon123> The real light side choice would have been to kill everyone

[1:02:46] <Space_Pagan> we did the jedi thing
[1:02:46] <+hotleaf_juice> That seems like the Jedi way
[1:02:50] <%correctedsun117> @startstoprepeat Good point
[1:02:50] <%jiggy_snipe> yea if that's the Queen's thing, whatever, you're not from there

[1:03:17] <+miyoles> my people like eatin babys
[1:03:19] <notenoughgirls> i think that person was sarcastically saying the jedi stay out of shit
[1:03:22] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie you are litterally arguing what the Jedi argued during the Mandalorean Wars
[1:03:22] <%BinaryFireball> converstation with fists
[1:03:30] <tattleworm> oh, i love your decisions, i just find it interesting
[1:03:30] <%RioGascar> Is iziz a monarchy? if so “right to fair trial” is not exactly common in a monarchy. Coup attempts END WITH THE COUPER BEING KILLED FOR TREASON

[1:03:38] <megamonmon123> genocide is the true light side path
[1:03:38] <+hotleaf_juice> What they mean is that the Jedi thing is not to interfere
[1:03:39] <notenoughgirls> council in the mandalorian wars type shit
[1:03:44] <Halospaz117> Oh yeah Kavar's alright
[1:03:47] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think he realizes the Mandalorian Wars thing
[1:03:54] <zocano> Kavar is good
[1:04:01] <KaitlynnHere> Oie!
[1:04:06] <+AsinPersuasion> of course he doesnt

[1:05:17] <+Urgoslav> Kavar gives a good name to guardians
[1:05:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Kavar was an advicate for war but couldn't leave the console
[1:05:28] <DatAsuna> nope
[1:05:30] <zocano> Kavar was going to be in Revan’s position
[1:05:44] <+MidnightBurst12> She plans to
[1:05:48] <DatAsuna> Atris was meant to be at atar but she didn't go
[1:05:53] <+evbites> It was me Pakk
[1:05:53] <DatAsuna> *katar
[1:05:57] <%RioGascar> I remember even as a kid this jedi master was someone i could agree with...tho 10 year old me vs kotor 2 was probably unable to contemplate whats going on
[1:06:01] <DatAsuna> ah he just said it
[1:06:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kavar was going to lead the army but revan took over
[1:06:10] <$TheFabledAble> ATris was supposed to go to katar?!?!?!?!?
[1:06:27] <Djinnazz> Why is it that when Jedi scatter they never train to get better/stronger?
[1:06:31] <$TheFabledAble> Wait wait wait, Atris was supposed to go to Katar, she didnt, and now she's claiming to be the last jedi
[1:06:37] <KaitlynnHere> Hawt damn!
[1:06:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> Oh shit!

[1:08:19] <%DensityD> literally literally literally k
[1:08:34] <%Irridium> millions were being killed by mandalorians. this is a civil war on a single planet
[1:08:37] <+oda_flobunaga> !uptime
[1:08:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 20 minutes
[1:08:46] <%StaceMcGate> has Woolie been to Korriban already?
[1:08:50] <+AsinPersuasion> scale doesnt matter
[1:08:50] <notenoughgirls> no
[1:08:52] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> no
[1:08:55] <Doodle_Taco> @stacemcgate no
[1:09:09] <%StaceMcGate> ok, so we still got tens of hours left
[1:09:11] <+AsinPersuasion> do you have to do korriban before the conclave?
[1:09:12] <KaitlynnHere> ....wait what were we talking about?
[1:09:27] <+AsinPersuasion> i thought the civil war happens aftwr all planets
[1:09:28] <megamonmon123> how long is the finale of this game?
[1:09:38] <+evbites> what if a jedi doesn't intervene but wants a people to die
[1:09:40] <lotharrio> Only reason Fann even bothered with these politics, is that one side shot at him, on sight.
[1:09:41] <%Gruhunchously> Dark Later
[1:09:42] <+oda_flobunaga> Jedi are negotiators though
[1:09:50] <Halospaz117> @AsinPersuasion Nah Onderon part 2 happens after you do another planet after the first visit
[1:09:52] <tattleworm> killing bin laden solved terrorism, after all
[1:09:54] <zocano> Onderon Part 2 happens after one planet after doing Dxun
[1:10:05] <Thepothero> Yeyeyeeyye
[1:10:05] <zocano> Or immediately if it’s the last thing you do
[1:10:08] <MasterDecoder> Kavar is great
[1:10:09] <%DensityD> credits will do fine
[1:10:11] <KaitlynnHere> @evbites they should just stop thinking about it then. At least that’s what the Jedi council would say
[1:10:12] <%BisoromiBear> Kavar is a real one
[1:10:14] <%HostilePoundcakes> This guy is great PogChamp
[1:10:14] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus btw this guy was YOUR master when you were a jedi, so that's partly why
[1:10:15] <Halospaz117> The Anti-Vrook
[1:10:18] <+SolidusRex> It was mostly just Vrook Woolie
[1:10:20] <Deadbulky> He said he would after the war was over, he legit
[1:10:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> THIS was the master that was supposed to lead the war against the mandalorians
[1:10:25] <%jiggy_snipe> I wonder if Vrook and Kavar get along
[1:10:29] <penitentpentwitch> "I like you more than Vrook." "A lot of people keep saying that after they meet Vrook."
[1:10:32] <Joestar1890> The jedi range from TOTAL ASSHOLES to cool guys
[1:10:35] <%Redblood801> Who are you and what have you done with the Jedi?
[1:10:41] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Its almost Vrook is everything wrong with the Jedi Council
[1:10:42] <%DensityD> woolie with more Rap references
[1:10:44] <%chll0ne> LUL LUL
[1:10:46] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Kevar is your closest mentor and agreed with you leaving, but couldn't support you due to council nonsense @WoolieVersus
[1:10:53] <KaitlynnHere> Lol
[1:10:57] <%DensityD> y'see, he listens to the rap, which gives him the brain damage
[1:10:58] <%therabbles> Jedi that actually lives in the world and not in a temple all hours
[1:11:17] <%DensityD> good god look at that crotch buldge
[1:11:17] <%Redblood801> Is Vrook a Mad Hoe?
[1:11:20] <christopherwpoindexter> Ducks-on
[1:11:22] <%Redblood801> Yes
[1:11:28] <Halospaz117> "I was actually doing my job, surprising I know"
[1:11:31] <+SolidusRex> Ducks on, ducks off
[1:11:41] <KaitlynnHere> Go ducks go!
[1:11:45] <DatAsuna> You can say sion btw kreia told you his name like 40 anime episodes ago
[1:12:02] <%Redblood801> Here come the Mighty Dxun
[1:12:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> crusty boy doesn't seem like he is smart enough to manipulate
[1:12:06] <notenoughgirls> they know both of their names
[1:12:09] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @DatAsuna wasn't that an accident due to mods tho??
[1:12:12] <christopherwpoindexter> @solidusrex @kaitlynnhere @redblood801 👊🏻
[1:12:13] <+evbites> @KaitlynnHere no i mean innocent people dying asking for help and the jedi is watching on the sidelines with popcorn
[1:12:19] <notenoughgirls> neither of which are ever spoken in game
[1:12:30] <+Munrowon> Crusty boy doesn't seem like the friend making sort, but neither does hungry boy
[1:12:34] <KaitlynnHere> @evbites but... they usually do that
[1:12:35] <DatAsuna> @abelincoln_catpuncher no? She just says his nme once you have can pass the first influence check
[1:12:41] <+Freeborg1997> @notenoughgirls Sion's is, one time on Korriban
[1:12:42] <+evbites> ok
[1:13:04] <+Urgoslav> crusty burger or hungry burger? who has more employees?
[1:13:11] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @DatAsuna hmmm, id have to look at it again. from what i recall, there isn't any context that specifies who it is
[1:13:12] <notenoughgirls> who says it?
[1:13:20] <+Freeborg1997> @notenoughgirls Kreia
[1:13:30] <notenoughgirls> ah
[1:13:35] <notenoughgirls> that makes sense
[1:13:37] <KaitlynnHere> @urgoslav crusty boy, hungry boy keeps eating his
[1:13:50] <DatAsuna> @abelincoln_catpuncher As someone who has kotor 2 open right now and did that convo this afternoon, it's just an influence check and it just says the word darth sion right there
[1:13:53] <+MidnightBurst12> Crusty boy seems like he can hold a normal conversation though
[1:14:00] <penitentpentwitch> Kreia: "I was tired of listening to you complain about Atris. So I'm solving the problem."
[1:14:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @penitentpentwitch thank you grandma
[1:14:29] <zocano> oops, wrong line
[1:14:29] <%CyanDeadEye> Crusty is more stealth, Hungry is still subtle but his actions are more... large scale.
[1:14:35] <zocano> said "he" and not "she"
[1:14:37] <DatAsuna> @abelincoln_catpuncher She'll tell you about the triumvirte way before she'll tell she was one.
[1:14:49] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @DatAsuna I believe ya dude, i just said I don't know if Kreia specifies if Sion is crusty boi
[1:14:50] <+eanscrale> The council had to function somehow
[1:14:52] <DatAsuna> He was YOUR master
[1:15:00] <%correctedsun117> Atris and Vrook are just extreme
[1:15:00] <zocano> There are gender goofs like that here and there
[1:15:02] <%jiggy_snipe> the council members are made up of different mindsets
[1:15:03] <+Urgoslav> He was a bit more woried about the ramifications of the decision.
[1:15:04] <notenoughgirls> you can ask t3 to replay it i think
[1:15:10] <Joestar1890> So is he the Obi-wan of the council?
[1:15:10] <christopherwpoindexter> just got here, ye, I caught up all the way until the stream today that I literally haven't seen at all until now, happy to be here, brb in a half hour or so @woolieversus also, notice when Kavar mentions that he wanted you to be a Guardian class, and if we were actually that class, he would have pointed out how you 'became a Guardian after all,' or some quote like that.
[1:15:19] <brachydios777> The council usually has its bright spots
[1:15:23] <zocano> Kavar was also going to lead the effort instead of Revan at one point
[1:15:32] <zocano> Learned this... last week?
[1:15:35] <zocano> Maybe the week before
[1:15:39] <lotharrio> It's saying something that this is the only Jedi Master that actively went out to hunt/seek out the Sith. The others are all hiding.
[1:15:56] <Halospaz117> Yeah Candalore said something about how the Mandos expected to go against Kavar instead of Revan
[1:16:19] <+oda_flobunaga> Normandy
[1:16:22] <%RioGascar> Theres usually one guy that’s genuinely trying to be good and do good, shame their work usually gets downplayed by the idiots above them
[1:16:28] <abelincoln_catpuncher> New Korriban
[1:16:37] <stayinthepocket> Kavar was definitely getting some of that royal ass. Did wonders to help him relax.
[1:16:38] <DatAsuna> It's more about it's location than it's resources
[1:17:14] <DatAsuna> Korriban is a rim world with no infrastructure
[1:17:16] <%Gruhunchously> !uptime
[1:17:17] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 28 minutes
[1:17:19] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Its prolly more advantageous as a trade world
[1:17:19] <lotharrio> Kavar's got a drawer in the Queen's bedroom. Might as well have a used condom on the floor.
[1:17:27] <%Ashenik1> lets say this planet is Cuba for USSR
[1:17:38] <%correctedsun117> Galaxies can be conquered with goods and services
[1:17:41] <penitentpentwitch> "By the way, the Royal Line is descended from Sith." "Well it exists, so it couldn't have been Jedi."
[1:17:49] <%RioGascar> korriban has nothing for anyone: infrastructure, agriculture, resources. Anything
[1:18:01] <+oda_flobunaga> Sith artifacts
[1:18:02] <%RioGascar> its a volcanic ash planet of nothing
[1:18:02] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> ate itself to death
[1:18:04] <%Ashenik1> Korriban in Madagascar
[1:18:06] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Korriban is a dead world basically
[1:18:09] <DatAsuna> It's just ruins now
[1:18:12] <lotharrio> It's not the center of a Sith Empire now... somehow.
[1:18:13] <notenoughgirls> we're going there soon anyway
[1:18:19] <%Gruhunchously> They deserved it for being bitches
[1:18:48] <brachydios777> The Sith need an emperor
[1:19:01] <+Urgoslav> Revan killed everyone at school in a fugue state of memory loss, not even a big brain play.
[1:19:04] <%RioGascar> Its like dagobah. that planet offers nothing to anyone but its strong in the force. Thats it
[1:19:10] <muniea3> Carths sons skeleton is still there for pissing on
[1:19:11] <lotharrio> It's also politically unstable, so it's ripe to be taken over and used as a puppet state.

[1:21:33] <Space_Pagan> Echo!
[1:21:58] <brachydios777> Because you’re a badass
[1:22:03] <DSD24> But they didn't learn
[1:22:12] <abelincoln_catpuncher> there's something thats similar between what happened to you and whats goin on with hungry boi
[1:22:18] <muniea3> big dick galaxy wide energy
[1:22:35] <+evbites> jedi council: your a weirdo help fight other weirdo
[1:22:44] <Deadbulky> Kappa
[1:22:44] <+Urgoslav> Kreia lies :O
[1:22:51] <DatAsuna> Yeah kreia is playing into your potential knowledge of the comics to think they did it again
[1:22:59] <Joestar1890> Whaaat? Kreia would NEVER lie to you!
[1:23:01] <%therabbles> Granny is a fibber
[1:23:02] <%RioGascar> its a bad plan but when it’s something you’ve never encountered and have no way to actually understand it without SOME frame of reference they need you for that frame
[1:23:11] <%Irridium> BETRAYAL
[1:23:11] <%Malik1002> IN FACT HK 47 CONFIRMED THAT REVAN SENT YOU THERE TO INSTALL FEAR
[1:23:11] <DatAsuna> and also playing on your knoledge of the kotor 1 twist
[1:23:15] <zocano> Best part is Kreia explicility tells you not to trust her
[1:23:17] <heartlesshealer> Kreia's comic-baiting you with BETRAYAL
[1:23:23] <zocano> That she *is* lying to you
[1:23:25] <zocano> And to deal with it
[1:23:34] <penitentpentwitch> Kreia: "I told you not to trust people. I am people."
[1:23:47] <DatAsuna> A lot of badasses died
[1:23:48] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I know Kreia is such a well-written character
[1:23:58] <%Redblood801> Are we drunk yet
[1:24:10] <+Urgoslav> Lot of pain in these echos
[1:24:13] <%Gruhunchously> Me being a badass was a plus
[1:24:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Redblood801 sir your liver has filed a workplace harassment lawsuit
[1:24:29] <lotharrio> He was here for booty.
[1:24:36] <%Gruhunchously> Pretty much
[1:24:38] <+Urgoslav> I'm deep in the echo drinks
[1:24:42] <+MidnightBurst12> Malachor is fucked
[1:24:43] <Deadbulky> Were about to get in some sht soon
[1:24:48] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Malacore is hell
[1:24:49] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Its like tapping into pure mental trauma
[1:24:50] <DatAsuna> A smaller scale of that happeneed to Revan with juhani's peple
[1:24:54] <%Redblood801> @doc_ock_rokc Aw man, I can't afford another one.
[1:24:56] <%chase959> I am all about that devils lettuce

[1:25:17] <Parapattern> Kind of like real war
[1:25:21] <+MidnightBurst12> That's for the localization
[1:25:23] <%Gruhunchously> Force djent
[1:25:32] <KatabolicRage> ah yes the reverse reverb story
[1:25:35] <%chll0ne> yamero!!
[1:25:53] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @Gruhunchously thats what you hear when you meditate at Malachor V
[1:26:12] <Doodle_Taco> T3: looking at Atris:"Okay masta! Let's kill the Ho!"
[1:26:31] <abelincoln_catpuncher> but ACTUALLY
[1:26:39] <heartlesshealer> thanks for explaining how to make the cool sounds to the star wars audience
[1:26:46] <+evbites> so koichi had 6 stands
[1:26:52] <%BisoromiBear> S H I T
[1:26:55] <%Redblood801> Do we drink every time Woolie and V say echo, or only in the game?
[1:27:02] <%RioGascar> music and audio composition gets super interesting with computers and the tech for audio
[1:27:04] <zocano> You asked it already I think
[1:27:05] <+Freeborg1997> So cool
[1:27:10] <Deadbulky> ...
[1:27:12] <%Gruhunchously> Oh god we're gonna die of alchohol poisoning
[1:27:17] <%Malik1002> this is such a refreshing person to talk to .
[1:27:28] <notenoughgirls> love how nuking a planet in this game actually has like. ramifications. remember when they just blew up a planet in episode 9 and it was never spoken of again?
[1:27:37] <%Gruhunchously> The queen was hot, what can I say?
[1:27:45] <DSD24> I thought it as multiple planets?
[1:27:49] <%RioGascar> i mean new hope blew up dantoine
[1:27:53] <SixthSun2> All this alcohol that's being drank is going to cause echoes of pain in of itself
[1:27:59] <%Irridium> In 7 they blew up that new planet they never named
[1:28:02] <%RioGascar> and all we get is ben going super shocked
[1:28:05] <%Irridium> that was the capital of the republic I guess
[1:28:07] <$TheFabledAble> kraia said you were dead to the force though
[1:28:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus There are people "dead" to the force its just rare
[1:28:09] <%Redblood801> @RioGascar They blew up Alderaan
[1:28:16] <%Gruhunchously> The Force exists in all life forms
[1:28:17] <$TheFabledAble> which is why your presence wasnt known to the sith for so long
[1:28:20] <Tuna_Can_0> D:
[1:28:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:28:23] <DatAsuna> It was hosnian prime
[1:28:25] <%RioGascar> I thought they blew up dantoine
[1:28:25] <Doodle_Taco> That's Nar Shada basically, just a sea of noise
[1:28:26] <DatAsuna> and named in the movie
[1:28:28] <penitentpentwitch> So a place without life would be 'Forceless'?
[1:28:29] <DatAsuna> it just never mattered
[1:28:31] <+Urgoslav> A voice said the E-word, and a thousand livers cried out in pain.
[1:28:34] <muniea3> it's nature chakra Woolie
[1:28:46] <+Freeborg1997> The Force only exists in the Star Wars galaxy. Once you leave the galaxy the force leaves you.
[1:28:56] <heartlesshealer> Forced Vacation?
[1:28:58] <%Redblood801> @RioGascar Dantooine is where Leia lied about the rebel base. They sent troops to investigate and found an old one
[1:29:01] <notenoughgirls> in 7 they blew up hosnian prime and its nearby planets but in 9 they blew up the planet where they got 3po's sith translated
[1:29:04] <DatAsuna> For context more harm was done because revan and malak also genocided planets, malak was "virus bombing" whole ecosystems
[1:29:11] <+Urgoslav> drink
[1:29:18] <%mitchteck> Oh fuck off
[1:29:20] <Joestar1890> Battle of Malachor was FUCKED, man
[1:29:42] <$TheFabledAble> Your choice to crush an entire planet, with enemies and allies all, fucked you up. whatever reasons you had, that choice effects you.
[1:29:42] <DSD24> That wasn't a good explanation
[1:29:45] <+UberWolfman> Vietnam but 100x worse
[1:29:52] <%alpacasintophats> oh so it's like how the warp got so bad in 40k
[1:29:57] <Djinnazz> like WW2
[1:29:58] <%Irridium> basically Shin Stalingrad
[1:30:03] <%alpacasintophats> i.e. way way too much death
[1:30:09] <%Irridium> just a super meat-grinder
[1:30:13] <%alpacasintophats> like an excessive amouint
[1:30:34] <heartlesshealer> force oracle thought train
[1:30:34] <zocano> Note his explanation was more around *you* not going to war
[1:30:34] <%jiggy_snipe> remember a bunch of jedi, citizens mandolorians died when something happened
[1:30:38] <Parapattern> The air was suffuse with the blood mist of both foe and ally
[1:30:52] <subjectg> malachor v was an extremely pivotal moment, and that’s all you know for now
[1:31:06] <Deadbulky> Cus hpyocritical jedi
[1:31:10] <+rider_megalon> JEDI CAN SEE THE FUTURE
[1:31:10] <%Redblood801> Just a reminder that when Jedi look into the future, you get the Taris Padawan MAssacre
[1:31:19] <penitentpentwitch> Jedi: "We don't know enough, for the greater good we'll watch and think about it."
[1:31:24] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> mah teachings
[1:31:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> Jedi can feel the future when they have enough time to do so
[1:31:36] <KatabolicRage> Benefit of hindsight aint it?
[1:31:39] <Joestar1890> But how much time do they NEED?
[1:31:42] <derap41> Jedi are Hypocrits who knew
[1:31:43] <notenoughgirls> actually now that i think of it i think in legends something similar happened with alderaan and it seriously affected the guy that activates the death star laser who was actually force sensitive
[1:31:52] <%chll0ne> thats the jedi way
[1:31:55] <Joestar1890> Because doing nothing only increases the death toll
[1:31:56] <%RioGascar> thing with “a place without life” in star wars is kinda impossible. since unless its a dead planet or planet that is unable to be inhabited you’ll have the force cause there’s animals, trees, plants, etc all flowing through the force and so on
[1:32:00] <KatabolicRage> eh, they didn't see the turn or they wouldn't have gotten so btfo by it
[1:32:00] <Parapattern> If you wait long enough anyone can see into the future
[1:32:06] <subjectg> it’s understandable that for the council, perhaps they were trying to prevent malachor v, even if it meant letting the mandalorians win
[1:32:20] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @TheFabledAble
[1:32:23] <Prince_Robot> kotor 1 is the jedi civil war
[1:32:23] <MarkUriah> These Jedi have a problem of Analysis Paralysis
[1:32:33] <%Gruhunchously> Mandalorian>Civil>Now
[1:32:35] <+MidnightBurst12> No?
[1:32:39] <notenoughgirls> jedi civil is also pre brainwash
[1:32:46] <%jiggy_snipe> wasn't that in the middle?
[1:32:47] <%Irridium> brainwash was mid-civil war
[1:32:48] <heartlesshealer> During, not after
[1:32:51] <%Gruhunchously> Techinally Revan was brainwashed during the Jedi Civil War
[1:32:53] <Djinnazz> yeah like that day.
[1:32:57] <%bigmacjack12> Now is the dark wars
[1:33:07] <+ntfth> @WoolieVersus Brainwashing was halfway through the civil war.
[1:33:10] <%RioGascar> that is the issue with jedi council since they over analyze everything at times and just...sometimes ya gotta do something
[1:33:15] <Doodle_Taco> Revan was brainwashed halfway
[1:33:21] <taomega20> they were split because half of them thought that the republic should be able to stand on it's own without jedi help and half of them thought they should fight to preserve more life
[1:33:24] <$TheFabledAble> In many ways their choice was a selfish one, because anything that would potentially corrupt them as jedi they simply AVOID. The war left a scar on you as well as everyone else who survived. They fear that temptation more than they care for the lives of those lost.
[1:33:30] <+MidnightBurst12> Mandalorian> Civil War Start > Brainwash > Civil war end (Kotor 1)
[1:33:34] <+Freeborg1997> "He"?
[1:33:38] <brachydios777> The same conflict was when Revan attacked the Republic and post memory loss
[1:33:59] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus it was halfway through the Civil war when she was brainwashed
[1:34:07] <+oda_flobunaga> Peace
[1:34:13] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:34:16] <taomega20> @zanco23 revan in canon is Male, exile in canon is female
[1:34:19] <%jiggy_snipe> the Calm Kappa
[1:34:29] <+oda_flobunaga> Meetra Surick
[1:34:32] <%bigmacjack12> This is the dark wars
[1:34:35] <%chll0ne> @taomega20 oh thats interesting
[1:34:37] <%Gruhunchously> I hate that name
[1:34:39] <Djinnazz> @taomega20 I think you got thatbackwards
[1:34:43] <+ojesus1289> hungry boi got swole for 5yrs
[1:34:44] <%RioGascar> The jedi echo a bit of America pre entering ww2 where we wanted to stay out of the war cause we just got our economy together and just didnt want to get involed...then well december 1942 happened
[1:34:48] <+oda_flobunaga> its the canon name though
[1:34:49] <KatabolicRage> I don't think the council saw the turn coming, they got surprise attacked quiet successfully by Revan
[1:34:56] <+AsinPersuasion> No hes right
[1:34:57] <Interestedsc00t> @Djinnazz no, exile is canon female and revan male.
[1:34:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Djinnazz No that is how it was
[1:35:06] <+oda_flobunaga> Whic name is worse, Freedon Nadd or Meetra Surick
[1:35:07] <+AsinPersuasion> In the book
[1:35:23] <Interestedsc00t> old republic acts as the canon in this scenario
[1:35:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:35:25] <heartlesshealer> Freedon Nadd is a worse name
[1:35:35] <DSD24> Meetra sounds cool at least
[1:35:40] <taomega20> revan canonicaly is Male and ends up in a relationship with bastila in the book
[1:35:44] <penitentpentwitch> Whatever looks good for the narrative you want.
[1:35:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> THEY WERE DEBATING THAT
[1:35:59] <%Ashenik1> Its like Easter Roman Empire War- Persian War weakend them so much made arabs able to conquer all of them
[1:36:06] <DatAsuna> the newer comics also get into this
[1:36:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kavar
[1:36:16] <+r3al_human_b3an> Love how there is no good answer just everyone doing what they think is right there are pros and cons to each decision
[1:36:16] <+prime_name> Malek?
[1:36:19] <%BinaryFireball> Depends on the amount of time it takes to process all those dominos
[1:36:38] <%jiggy_snipe> you can stop 9/11 but WW3 happens
[1:36:40] <DSD24> The poor Kitty
[1:36:43] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus It makes way less sense if Reven finishes KOTOR 1 lightside
[1:36:45] <Joestar1890> No trust in the force tho
[1:36:53] <+Solutha> Is this the result of woolies dokapon turns
[1:36:55] <taomega20> @woolieversus they wanted to show the universe that the republic could stand on their own without jedi help
[1:36:56] <MarkUriah> It helps to think that the Jedi Council was having this conversation before the Mandalorian War
[1:37:00] <Doodle_Taco> There's a Harlan Ellison book like that I think
[1:37:03] <+eanscrale> The problem is elaborating possibly makes all the dominoes fall anyway
[1:37:04] <+Freeborg1997> Are the kittens the Cathar?
[1:37:06] <%RioGascar> you stopped hitler but now japan beat us to the nuke and the world got destroyed
[1:37:09] <subjectg> no one gives you an answer because they only have instinct and gut instinct
[1:37:09] <%RioGascar> whoops
[1:37:11] <+ojesus1289> it's a evil kitten
[1:37:13] <dereks0n> Literally everybody has said that it led to another war
[1:37:14] <%Redblood801> Man, don't you hate when you save a kitten and the planet blows up?
[1:37:15] <MasterDecoder> @Zanco23 Damn
[1:37:17] <+hotleaf_juice> That one deleted scene from last Jedi with Luke and Rey is somewhat related to this
[1:37:22] <+Arthasgnome> @WoolieVersus The council was debating how many dominoes when Revan went off to war.
[1:37:22] <+Urgoslav> Revan did some fuckin' work, to the point were people trust him if he kills the kitten or not.
[1:37:22] <derap41> So Nuking Japan so you don' have to invade Japan
[1:37:23] <%bigmacjack12> Theres a good answer, kotor comics has it
[1:37:23] <Doki__Doki> are we talking about the movie looper?
[1:37:24] <+Buzzkill983> You saved Kid Hitler. How was I supposed to know
[1:37:27] <+oda_flobunaga> metamorphed Hitler kitten
[1:37:29] <Doki__Doki> or kitties?
[1:37:46] <%jiggy_snipe> this is fun
[1:37:49] <%Gruhunchously> When artists go bad
[1:37:51] <SixthSun2> Hitler's art was ass, though, he deserved the criticism
[1:37:57] <%Gruhunchously> Intrusive thots
[1:37:57] <$Invlux> All women are QUEENS
[1:38:01] <derap41> These Tangents are what people come here for
[1:38:01] <penitentpentwitch> It makes the playthrough four times longer and six times better. Keep talking!
[1:38:04] <%HostilePoundcakes> IF SHE BREATHS
[1:38:05] <+UberWolfman> Hitler just wanted to sell his Doujins in peace BibleThump
[1:38:10] <Narukamiiii> Also saving the kitten kinda breaks you a little bit
[1:38:14] <+MidnightBurst12> The horrors of war?
[1:38:17] <SpecterHDMC> Remember hitler was saved by a priest in fire when he was a child
[1:38:17] <DatAsuna> Revan fell fighting
[1:38:18] <+Urgoslav> Isn't saving kid Hitler the plot of Monster?
[1:38:19] <MasterDecoder> @SixthSun2 The ones I've seen weren't that bad
[1:38:21] <%RioGascar> what if’s are interesting but at some point action needs to be taken
[1:38:24] <%Ashenik1> Kitten was adopted by Adolf, then Adolf lost it by not being able to feed it cause economical depression, who cause that, who made me me kitten starve... oooh these jews
[1:38:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus The council was debating going to war kavar was all about going to war fuck the future
[1:38:29] <DatAsuna> What you're asking about is stuff that happened after the fall
[1:38:30] <+r3al_human_b3an> I dunno the war was brutal whether the council backed it or not
[1:38:39] <%bigmacjack12> Theres a whole jedi subsect during the mando war that theyre dealing with
[1:38:39] <Doodle_Taco> Mayve they could've kept her in check, or they would all have fallen
[1:38:40] <DatAsuna> fighting itself was the fall
[1:38:41] <subjectg> It’s implied that revan would’ve sought out the knowledge beyond the council anyway
[1:38:42] <%RioGascar> If you just continue and continue to fear the what ifs ANXIETY WILL JUST SHUT YOU DOWN AND YOU DO NOTHING
[1:38:45] <+oda_flobunaga> Deadpool saved baby Hitler TBH
[1:38:49] <DatAsuna> And it was like their third sith problem
[1:38:59] <%jiggy_snipe> oops all Sith
[1:39:00] <derap41> Its like the force is trying to balance or something
[1:39:04] <penitentpentwitch> Portal opens: Revan Must Fall!
[1:39:07] <taomega20> okay, but are they taking into account the sith emperor in the unknown reigions?
[1:39:13] <DatAsuna> Ulic and Exar were war heroes like Revan too
[1:39:13] <trinityxlv> WW2 doesnt happen, WW2 happens later between USA and Russia with full nuke stockpiles
[1:39:26] <%Gruhunchously> THE SACRED TEXTS
[1:39:30] <%Redblood801> THE SACRED TEXTS!
[1:39:31] <Darkrenai> Theres always that one asshole on the jedi council who doesnt waver in the jedi code
[1:39:37] <abelincoln_catpuncher> but the bible said!
[1:39:44] <%Ashenik1> If you let mandalorian (romans) conqer you you may be enslaved but the satbility and miltary power would make every Sith your bitch
[1:39:47] <%Redblood801> cough cough Windu cough cough
[1:39:54] <%Gruhunchously> I'd like to see Vrook fight in the war
[1:40:40] <+Urgoslav> rip kotor yoda
[1:40:41] <brachydios777> Remember Obi-Wan lost everything and still didn’t turned
[1:40:42] <taomega20> they also felt the sith emperors force signature on revan and malak
[1:40:42] <%Gruhunchously> And all the people on the planet were killed as well.
[1:40:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> And all that is left is Karen

[1:41:35] <Joestar1890> KOTOR Jedi-Sith Politics is the BEST
[1:41:35] <CSeriesJTYPE> the entire point is that the council believed it wasnt their problem, that going to war, even if it meant saving lives, was nothing more than an act of aggression which was a slippery slope to the dark side as far as they were concerned
[1:41:36] <muniea3> how did he know about my porn tab?!

[1:42:23] <bearalin> Hmm
[1:42:23] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:42:24] <+oda_flobunaga> Good writers will do that

[1:42:31] <Joestar1890> This is that one Star Wars movie but done BETTER
[1:42:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> Now you know why people hated the LAST JEDI
[1:42:36] <CSeriesJTYPE> because the movies dont grapple with this idea of values-neutral governance on the part of the jedi
[1:42:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @datasuna -Heavy sigh-
[1:42:44] <zocano> huh? What woman?
[1:42:48] <zocano> There's just you and T3
[1:42:52] <derap41> -_- Granny
[1:42:52] <+r3al_human_b3an> This game ruined star wars for me. I hold it to this games standard
[1:42:56] <Darkrenai> Granny is never wrong
[1:42:56] <%jiggy_snipe> what woman
[1:42:56] <notenoughgirls> what woman?
[1:43:01] <%Gruhunchously> Who?
[1:43:02] <%HostilePoundcakes> who?
[1:43:05] <+oda_flobunaga> TGOT
[1:43:05] <%Redblood801> Last Jedi is the diet, off brand, out of date version of this game
[1:43:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Literally who?
[1:43:08] <penitentpentwitch> Granny is starring super hard at the dialogue options to make sure it doesn't pop up.
[1:43:08] <+Billyfig1> Doesn't look like anyone to me
[1:43:09] <Joestar1890> @doc_ock_rokc I always say to my cousins and friends, this movie was just a worse Kotor 2
[1:43:10] <+ntfth> Who's Kreia?
[1:43:16] <CSeriesJTYPE> the jedi believe anything other than self restraint will cause them to fall even if it meant enacting justice, and never considered using the dark side as a tool of justice
[1:43:17] <+oda_flobunaga> That GRANNY OVER THERE
[1:43:20] <DatAsuna> You can literally ask her why the masters never look at her or talk to her
[1:43:24] <Doodle_Taco> @redblood801 That's correct
[1:43:26] <Deadbulky> Granny Ninja
[1:43:36] <Joestar1890> What the hell is a Kreia?
[1:43:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Its almost like if you give good writers the room to play with the concepts and themes of the universe, you'll get a good story out of it
[1:43:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's Grieving Mother.
[1:43:41] <%gatorafan> @deadbulky Graninja if you would
[1:43:41] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you CAN ask her about that though
[1:43:55] <subjectg> I really love the idea of hiding yourself from people using the force
[1:43:56] <+oda_flobunaga> Black Gift?
[1:43:57] <Ravenian96> Did they ever ask Kreia how she knows about Revan?
[1:43:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Joestar1890 My brother is like "This is the first time the jedi have been deconstructed" and I told him did he even try to play kotor 2 and he got angry with me
[1:44:09] <DatAsuna> @Ravenian96 yeah it's in the naime
[1:44:11] <DatAsuna> *anime
[1:44:11] <%Dtb_baron> Cheer555 Thank you woolie this is the part of star wars I have missed the most enjoy your journey
[1:44:21] <StarlitStunner> @commandersqueaks yo Pillars of Eternity is great, I miss Grieving Mother in the second game
[1:44:23] <blackskulldragon18> he at least more kinder then that old man
[1:44:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @starlitstunner Did you see what happens if you sacrifice her to the blood pool?
[1:44:44] <derap41> That corpse just laying there you'd think they would clean up the throne room
[1:44:46] <%jiggy_snipe> I mean you're part of the council tho?
[1:44:51] <Darkrenai> Padawan PogChamp
[1:44:55] <penitentpentwitch> Jedi: "We cant talk until we've gathered all the pieces of eight into one council chamber."
[1:44:55] <%Gruhunchously> YOu get slightly different dialogue if you're a Guardian
[1:44:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @starlitstunner Isn't Grieving Mother another potential branch of Ravel?
[1:44:59] <heartlesshealer> The would be godfather jedi
[1:45:04] <+evbites> who was pakk's master
[1:45:05] <Doodle_Taco> This guy is great
[1:45:06] <+oda_flobunaga> @StarlitStunner Grieving Mother was written by Avellone
[1:45:11] <Joestar1890> @doc_ock_rokc Luckily, my cousins were at least somewhat interested in checking it out
[1:45:24] <%Reaper102388> Reaper102388 subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:45:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus The masters teach younglings then they select a padawan
[1:45:33] <notenoughgirls> he likes you and trusts you but he isnt able to answer you question due to the council oath
[1:45:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Squire.
[1:45:35] <StarlitStunner> I’m too big a coward to sacrifice my crew, I’ll check it out though @commandersqueaks
[1:45:35] <lotharrio> Difference between teacher and mentor.
[1:45:35] <DSD24> Grieving Mom was so cool
[1:45:39] <%Redblood801> A padawan is just being an intern
[1:45:40] <KaiserMario> A padawan is like a wakashu
[1:45:40] <%Gruhunchously> Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan
[1:45:43] <DSD24> Ciphers are a rad class
[1:45:48] <derap41> You were in his class
[1:45:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @starlitstunner It's the most morbidly hilarious shit.
[1:45:52] <%Redblood801> A Squire even
[1:45:52] <+ntfth> A Padawan is like a squire.
[1:45:53] <+oda_flobunaga> He ran a class with you in it
[1:45:59] <Darkrenai> Hey if you become my padawan you will get a lot of experience and exposure
[1:46:00] <heartlesshealer> student-teacher relationship, but more family
[1:46:01] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> All the masters are university professors
[1:46:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> They were all your teachers, but your master is your home room teacher @woolieversus
[1:46:10] <%CEGold> Ahsoka was trained by both Obi Wan and Anakin, but she was Anakin's Padawan
[1:46:13] <+oda_flobunaga> TGOT
[1:46:14] <+AsinPersuasion> He taught English not homeroom
[1:46:18] <+Urgoslav> She's doing shady shit in the corner atm
[1:46:28] <KaitlynnHere> She already lost a hand
[1:46:40] <KaitlynnHere> And her eye sight
[1:46:45] <KaitlynnHere> What’s next?
[1:46:53] <penitentpentwitch> Kreia: "You can't see me flipping you off right now. It's on the hand that's floating in space."
[1:46:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's a Guardian, his job is to hit things.
[1:46:56] <+prime_name> Her teeth?
[1:46:58] <%Redblood801> @KaitlynnHere My respect
[1:47:06] <%RioGascar> Hes a battle man
[1:47:16] <Deadbulky> Real good sht soon
[1:47:16] <DSD24> Vrook came in late that one time
[1:47:19] <KaitlynnHere> @redblood801 lol, exactly
[1:47:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @penitentpentwitch Oh come now, we both know she would be fliping both birds
[1:47:24] <%therabbles> Vrook: "Im gonna cause problems on purpose"
[1:47:28] <%RioGascar> Hes wanting to get action but he’s slightly wiser in a way of having restraint
[1:47:30] <+Urgoslav> he would woop those mandalorian duelists asses
[1:47:31] <%Gruhunchously> Mical was a Jedi student once
[1:47:33] <lotharrio> Mikal is doing spywork.
[1:47:34] <%gatorafan> haha lightsaber goes bwoooon - Jedi Guardian
[1:47:39] <%jiggy_snipe> admitting you don't know is a skill surprisingly
[1:47:46] <DatAsuna> Mastter of the blue balls
[1:47:56] <+MidnightBurst12> He also isn't dragged down by decades of dogma
[1:47:59] <KaitlynnHere> She just force push her food into pulp and slurp it up
[1:48:09] <MarkUriah> But still Kevar would've been the one to keep saying "I don't know" in times where action is needed.
[1:48:18] <Darkrenai> Wouldnt it be real convenient if the jedi council met up on dantooine 👀
[1:48:29] <+oda_flobunaga> USELESS
[1:48:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> AUDIO MIXING
[1:48:35] <KaitlynnHere> That force power was loud
[1:48:42] <penitentpentwitch> So the cooler the Jedi the worse abilities they can teach?
[1:48:43] <%Zohare> With careful concertration I'll make the audio mixing terrible
[1:48:44] <lotharrio> Went for caster, Woolie. What doy ou want?
[1:48:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> So it makes buffs last longer? lame
[1:48:54] <+Urgoslav> Woolie isn't light side at all
[1:48:56] <%Redblood801> You did this to yourself Woolie
[1:48:58] <%chll0ne> thats loud as hell
[1:49:00] <heartlesshealer> what is that form for? Rapid-fire Force Heal????
[1:49:02] <zocano> Hey look it's Kre- wait no one was there
[1:49:03] <DSD24> Hey its the Queen
[1:49:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> Shudda ben a guardian
[1:49:11] <KaitlynnHere> Now kiss
[1:49:15] <%gatorafan> The Audio Mix side of the force has many abilities some would consider.... unnatural
[1:49:15] <%jiggy_snipe> she's gonna thank you personally Kappa
[1:49:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie decides to be a caster, complains about lack of aggressiveness in forms.

[1:51:11] <+evbites> i won end of discussion
[1:51:15] <derap41> Mira is an idiot remember
[1:51:22] <DatAsuna> nice and choice agnostic
[1:51:24] <%Gruhunchously> Come on, it's not like Fann doens't constantly ask questions he already knows the answer to
[1:51:28] <DSD24> @StarlitStunner Yep Casters are my favorite class
[1:51:29] <notenoughgirls> i love atton's response when you say that
[1:51:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> THE SECOND WAR
[1:51:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> He has ended single-handedly.
[1:51:45] <The_Nerd_Supreme> it does this regardless of who you choose as leader
[1:51:54] <%Gruhunchously> Guys, it's too late for Mira, let it go

[1:52:13] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Please tell me we aren't ending it here
[1:52:13] <+evbites> imagine a starwars without a war
[1:52:19] <The_Nerd_Supreme> they always ask that question
[1:52:23] <notenoughgirls> youre gonna need to force console command for mira and goto
[1:52:25] <+Freeborg1997> Ewwww, Mira
[1:52:33] <StarlitStunner> finoBorger Gotta go avengers man, Jalter demands it @dsd24
[1:52:34] <+evbites> Starpeace
[1:52:37] <+AsinPersuasion> Not making her a jedi?
[1:52:39] <%Redblood801> So if Mira doesn't have enough influence, you'll need a save editor to remedy that
[1:52:44] <%timbob> woolieS woolieT

[1:52:56] <%Gruhunchously> Auto-pilot
[1:52:56] <lotharrio> They found another one.
[1:52:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man, perception filters in fiction are so fucking cool.
[1:52:57] <penitentpentwitch> Mandalore: "Of course we have backup ships."
[1:53:03] <%dorpork> goto's secret and mira's turning are some of the best parts of the game.
[1:53:04] <zocano> Looks kinda like Ikaruga
[1:53:06] <%Irridium> they called the space tow-truck
[1:53:08] <+Freeborg1997> @AsinPersuasion Yeah, no way to make her a jedi at this point. They missed all the points on Dantooine.
[1:53:10] <notenoughgirls> there are no more influence opportunities for mira or goto
[1:53:11] <%dorpork> it would be a shame if they missed those
[1:53:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> 14 MONTHS
[1:53:14] <DSD24> @StarlitStunner Berserkers too since Jalter summer is this year!
[1:53:17] <%correctedsun117> Landing gear is for coward Jedi
[1:53:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> They had another
[1:53:21] <+AsinPersuasion> Oh damn
[1:53:22] <DatAsuna> I still think it's silly to make a "droid mount" into a starfighter
[1:53:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> They had another ship
[1:53:25] <subjectg> Now that we’ve finished Onderon, that means the THING on Nar Shaddaa should be there

[1:53:53] <zocano> Kinda the best
[1:54:12] <heartlesshealer> people who like shmups should give ikaruga a try if they haven't
[1:54:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> oh so its like tohhou /s
[1:54:14] <Tucker0603> Ikaruga is in my top 20 games I FUCKING LOVE it
[1:54:14] <+charmquarke> zero ranger I feel is almost up to that level
[1:54:15] <%RioGascar> disagree, TYRIAN 2000 is the best schmup
[1:54:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Since Fann'Y can basically huff chlorine gas like its oxygen, what would he have to huff to get high?
[1:54:24] <+oda_flobunaga> Nier Automata?
[1:54:31] <zocano> I wasn't a fan of Radiant Silvergun

[1:55:17] <+AsinPersuasion> Have they found out goto's deal?
[1:55:19] <heartlesshealer> they were made that way
[1:55:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> GOTO uses FAT as his memory
[1:55:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> He wants his chassis to provide a luxurious ride for his CPU
[1:55:31] <%Redblood801> Did we ever finish Visas?
[1:55:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh my god GOTO is going to his manager, GOTO is a fucking KAREN
[1:55:34] <AMaidIndeed> FAT is stored in the balls

[1:55:53] <+vaporousTippler> Is this even a face to face conversation?
[1:55:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @oda_flobunaga Since when has Pat actually been upset about being called an Orb?
[1:56:17] <+oda_flobunaga> IDK
[1:56:18] <heartlesshealer> Woolie was able to teach Visas force powers if I remember correctly, so they're probably finished on her stuff???
[1:56:19] <DatAsuna> You don't but backing out would let you know
[1:56:21] <+Urgoslav> can they see through the lava-lamp face masks?
[1:56:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> I want to imagine that T3 is still upset about his bitch weak shock lazer during that fight, just roaming around the ship going "Doooo......"

[1:57:43] <lotharrio> Ask her about Dxun?
[1:57:51] <%mitchteck> Is it fucked?
[1:57:52] <%Irridium> @lotharrio already did that. nothing.

[1:58:00] <notenoughgirls> force console command
[1:58:06] <DatAsuna> You messed up by not boosting her on dantooine when you brought atton out for an inf point, even though you already maxed him out.

[2:02:47] <DSD24> He got the Fann Y' Pak crystal
[2:02:52] <+Urgoslav> ok

[2:03:56] <DatAsuna> That's a lot of save slots
[2:03:56] <snakemuho> do KSE
[2:03:56] <%Gruhunchously> @THERE'S ONE MORE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET G0T0
[2:04:04] <+CatastropheCorvid> Set it with the console!
[2:04:07] <%hzflank> KSE save file editor
[2:04:08] <snakemuho> just get KSE
[2:04:09] <penitentpentwitch> I guess we're stopping here?
[2:04:13] <derap41> Is Mira really worth it tho?
[2:04:14] <+CatastropheCorvid> Just use KSE!
[2:04:14] <DatAsuna> It's easy enough on windows but you have to launch a browser
[2:04:17] <dinnydanny777> _/AddLightSidePoints
[2:04:18] <Deadbulky> Cheat then, try not to break the game
[2:04:19] <%therabbles> to the ini
[2:04:19] <MarkUriah> KSE
[2:04:19] <%HostilePoundcakes> Force cheat codes
[2:04:20] <+Freeborg1997> swkotor.ini
[2:04:20] <notenoughgirls> goto is
[2:04:20] <DatAsuna> no cheat codes needed for save edit
[2:04:21] <%Redblood801> KSE
[2:04:21] <lotharrio> It's in the .ini
[2:04:25] <DatAsuna> save edit is easier
[2:04:25] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> save editor is easier imo
[2:04:27] <Space_Pagan> ini
[2:04:27] <%Redblood801> SAve editor
[2:04:31] <abelincoln_catpuncher> KSE
[2:04:32] <+AsinPersuasion> 1 more isnt enough for goto
[2:04:33] <+CatastropheCorvid> Save editor is easiest!
[2:04:34] <ingman112> Just use the save editor
[2:04:35] <%hzflank> Once the editor is installed, ity takes 10 seconds
[2:04:38] <xiccy> KSE
[2:04:48] <MarkUriah> No Achievements
[2:04:50] <DSD24> That's dumb
[2:04:52] <%Redblood801> Call outas
[2:04:53] <subjectg> while you’re at it might as well get mandalore some influence
[2:04:53] <Space_Pagan> Save editor
[2:04:55] <snakemuho> it's fast
[2:04:58] <derap41> There's also cheat engine
[2:05:01] <+AjaxFoamingCleanser> Kotor might not know, but we will
[2:05:02] <DatAsuna> you can do it between sessions
[2:05:08] <$xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @WoolieVersus Super simple
[2:05:08] <MarkUriah> Nope
[2:05:08] <%Irridium> it's not too difficult
[2:05:13] <lotharrio> It's like two steps.
[2:05:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's easy but BACKUP THE SAVES
[2:05:16] <snakemuho> you open the save, open a tab and edit the number
[2:05:16] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> backup your stuff first
[2:05:18] <%Redblood801> It's on Steam Workshop
[2:05:22] <%Redblood801> Super easy
[2:05:25] <%Irridium> yes back up saves just in case
[2:05:28] <+CatastropheCorvid> I've done it,KSA is super easy/
[2:05:29] <notenoughgirls> there's no point to getting mandalore influence
[2:05:30] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Might as well save it for next time
[2:05:35] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you can do it under 30 seconds if you know what to do. If you're not comfortable, you can just throw me your save and I'll shoot it back at you within a minute or two
[2:05:36] <Monkeyweed21> its basically editing an ini file
[2:05:42] <Deadbulky> Yh be sure to backup
[2:05:50] <%Redblood801> I don't think cheats work for influence
[2:05:54] <DougintheTrench> @WoolieVersus Console commands don't do influence, just dark and light side! Been playing with you can been cheating.
[2:05:55] <DatAsuna> the ini should be swkotor2.ini
[2:05:57] <subjectg> @notenoughgirls i thought he had some flavor dialogue, would be neat to see
[2:06:01] <snakemuho> it's not
[2:06:06] <+Freeborg1997> Yeah, I remember there isn't a cheat for influence.
[2:06:08] <shincadad> There’s a community mod that unlocks all influence checks
[2:06:11] <Monkeyweed21> its just changing a number in like an ini file
[2:06:15] <+CatastropheCorvid> The save editor is a GUI interface, super easy.
[2:06:17] <+Arthasgnome> @WoolieVersus The save editor is the easiest thing ever done my man or god
[2:06:18] <endarren> The save editor is pretty easy to use
[2:06:19] <MarkUriah> Save editing through KSE is not dangerous
[2:06:35] <DatAsuna> Yeah KSE's gui just lets you go "__ influence = 100"
[2:06:39] <+Freeborg1997> @Arthasgnome THIS
[2:06:41] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus There's one more place you can get G0T0 influence
[2:06:59] <%Redblood801> Console has no influence cheats
[2:07:02] <%themanski_90> themanski_90 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Redblood801! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel!
[2:07:02] <Space_Pagan> no influence cheat
[2:07:10] <%Irridium> I don't think one more will be enough for GOTO but worth a shot
[2:07:23] <DatAsuna> You don't wanna persona it
[2:07:35] <%Redblood801> Here we go gang
[2:07:59] <%chll0ne> are we in the endgame now?
[2:08:07] <jnaynnay> What about mandalore
[2:08:09] <%StaceMcGate> @CozyGUNNA not even close
[2:08:10] <%RioGascar> Not yet
[2:08:15] <snakemuho> 1 more planet before pre-endgame
[2:08:19] <zocano> That's weird cause I absolutely got enough Goto influence with just talking to him basically
[2:08:21] <+Freeborg1997> @CozyGUNNA Not quite, we still have 1 more planet
[2:08:22] <%chll0ne> jesus christ
[2:08:29] <zocano> Maybe it's cause dark side answers in convo

[2:09:47] <%chll0ne> yeah the mystery is killing me tbh, but i love it

[2:11:07] <DSD24> @AMaidIndeed I hate that guy, what was his name Nazeem?
[2:11:07] <%mitchteck> Maybe this will give influence
[2:11:10] <+prime_name> These games a rife with things not triggering because of bugs or somesuch

[2:20:44] <%CursedNobleman> FannYPak teaches HK Empathy; Tags: Robots, Mindbreak
[2:20:47] <DatAsuna> There is one step to configure it first
[2:20:56] <DatAsuna> but that's pretty simple too
[2:20:59] <snakemuho> there are guides for 100% influences for both light and dark
[2:21:25] <Darkrenai> Min Max every day
[2:21:29] <Joestar1890> @CursedNobleman Corruption (?)
[2:21:31] <lotharrio> Negative influence is also a thing. You can play to your character... mostly.
[2:21:32] <+SlappyMeats> Sociopathy required
[2:21:36] <%RioGascar> roleplay is more fun than gameplay at times i find
[2:21:46] <snakemuho> yeah you can go full negative influence and it's the same as full positive influence
[2:21:46] <Safarihat> i do both lul
[2:21:48] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus I checked, and the thing on Nar Shaddaa is dependent on something you did on Telos,, so that's why it didn't work.
[2:21:48] <%Redblood801> There is a Steam Workshop mod that turns ALL negative influence options to positive influence
[2:21:50] <a_mad_dragon> getting the SMT4 neutral ending Kappa
[2:21:51] <%Irridium> those people are crazy
[2:21:51] <KaitlynnHere> No buttons pressed
[2:21:53] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah their name is MInh lol @WoolieVersus
[2:21:56] <DatAsuna> Pat?
[2:21:57] <%CEGold> It's why I dont really like how morality systems are implemented in some of these types of games
[2:22:02] <derap41> isn't that what you're doing?
[2:22:10] <%RioGascar> like how would my character i make handle the situation. Problem i find is sometimes the role play is quite limited
[2:22:14] <%CursedNobleman> please, i do that outside of roleplay. i lie to people to make them feel better
[2:22:14] <+AsinPersuasion> Lot more leeway in p5r
[2:22:17] <%Zebroneath> Did we get everything from HK?
[2:22:21] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but then you roleplay and get the shit ending
[2:22:27] <%CEGold> Youre only rewarded for being 100% good or evil *stares at inFAMOUS*
[2:22:35] <+oda_flobunaga> But how can you have fun without playing optimally? Kappa
[2:22:36] <%chll0ne> i play like that for 2nd or 3rd walkthroughs
[2:22:36] <%HostilePoundcakes> Big Brain V
[2:22:37] <ChinMusicTwo> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:22:41] <%Struggleful> I got the neutral ending on SMT IV because law and chaos were too dumb
[2:22:43] <%jiggy_snipe> you have played this alot then
[2:22:44] <%mitchteck> I did that for my 2nd playthrough Of p5r
[2:22:46] <%ChoculaUltra> V Mills, the true No Life King
[2:22:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> My 1st run was max influence on everyone, but Bao Dur.
[2:22:58] <DatAsuna> SMH damashi
[2:23:00] <%chll0ne> i didnt care about p5’s characters that much anyway LUL
[2:23:12] <notenoughgirls> in my first playthrough i antagonized handmaiden by accident
[2:23:15] <%chll0ne> @struggleful neutral feels most fulfilling
[2:23:19] <+Urgoslav> Hey, the game isn't blind lightside or dark. thas da point
[2:23:19] <KaitlynnHere> At least you don’t know how to speed run KOTOR
[2:23:25] <KaitlynnHere> Oh.... wait
[2:23:44] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Its fucking hard to max out Bao Dur
[2:23:46] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus you should take the consequences you are due for the choices you make
[2:23:50] <DatAsuna> onestly no, but hey, another force user
[2:23:54] <+oda_flobunaga> honestly
[2:23:58] <%RioGascar> In my first play through as a kid I remember being super light sided except in acts of revenge or aggressive action
[2:24:02] <snakemuho> but it does have a cool scene at one point
[2:24:06] <lotharrio> Oh yeah, I'd say you probably want to just skip Mira and watch GOTO's stuff.
[2:24:21] <DatAsuna> Only if you don't touch the boolenas/numerics
[2:24:33] <snakemuho> just change influence numbers and you're good
[2:24:39] <DatAsuna> Well just g back in game, make anew save and name it "edit"
[2:24:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:24:42] <derap41> Don't think these influence events overlap
[2:25:01] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, that's understandable
[2:25:04] <+oda_flobunaga> 1 pt change is basically nothing soooooo
[2:25:04] <derap41> Of course it would be Mira fucking things up
[2:25:13] <%Gruhunchously> We're also missing one point with G0T0
[2:25:20] <notenoughgirls> they also fucked up when goto first joined
[2:25:25] <%Redblood801> I didn't do anything
[2:25:25] <ingman112> B/c you said he was useless

[2:25:40] <%BisoromiBear> UNO GUEY
[2:25:43] <%DensityD> 'mores
[2:25:45] <derap41> Mira is lame
[2:25:45] <%Irridium> they were probably playing with a mod or something that adds a bunch more triggers
[2:25:46] <+Freeborg1997> I picked Handmaiden as party leader, and she got pissed at me.
[2:25:46] <Space_Pagan> BETRAYAL
[2:25:47] <%Gruhunchously> WE WERE THE CHOSEN ONES
[2:25:49] <subjectg> i didn’t do nuffin!
[2:25:53] <snakemuho> Visas leader every time
[2:26:15] <%Gruhunchously> Guilty as charged
[2:26:17] <%Irridium> oh yeah my first playthrough I missed so much LUL
[2:26:21] <lotharrio> I mean, I don't really care about Mira. I'm more of a Visas guy.
[2:26:22] <+AsinPersuasion> Thats true for me re reactions lol
[2:26:24] <subjectg> same here
[2:26:24] <zocano> Ya my first playthrough I missed making ppl Jedi
[2:26:29] <KaitlynnHere> Buh-tway-al!
[2:26:32] <+oda_flobunaga> On my first DS3 playthrough I played a mage build but missed the mage trainer...
[2:26:37] <Deadbulky> Making mira Sith makes her a much better character Kreygasm
[2:26:40] <zocano> Only Handmaiden became a Jedi for me
[2:26:40] <%RioGascar> Thing also is HOW MANY PEOPLE actually replay these games
[2:26:40] <DatAsuna> Most of the time yes
[2:26:51] <+oda_flobunaga> soo, I didn't get new spells until Karla
[2:26:53] <subjectg> This is a game that requires a LOT of guidance to get content
[2:26:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Lies V, we've seen and played everything. How dare you imply we're not omnipotent!
[2:27:04] <%RioGascar> i have not replayed kotor 1 &2 since i beat them as a kid. Its just too long
[2:27:04] <DatAsuna> That guy you killed for the saber part actually has a bunch of special unique party dialogue tied to him
[2:27:04] <%hzflank> I've played this game a dozen times, I still cannot max every single thing on a single playthrough (xp, influence and alignment)
[2:27:10] <%Gruhunchously> Especially when there are companions who are gender and alignment based
[2:27:26] <+oda_flobunaga> boring way t play
[2:27:27] <Halospaz117> Yeah, like, I wanna play a game not a checklist
[2:27:32] <derap41> I did that for Dark Souls it was pretty fun
[2:27:38] <DatAsuna> You can also get the saber part from him by emotionally manipulating him to depend on you and kreia is way into it
[2:27:48] <+prime_name> I just don't want to miss stuff.
[2:27:52] <%Redblood801> With mods, you can max influence AND play the way you want
[2:27:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> FOMA is powerful
[2:27:55] <+Solutha> Not everyone has time to go through games multiple times especially persona
[2:27:57] <%DaPurpleSharpie> WHAT TIME IS SKULLGIRLS TOMORROW, WOOLIE
[2:28:01] <%RioGascar> its the boring part i find when i played d&d with min maxers and dont role play at all
[2:28:07] <%DaPurpleSharpie> DaPurpleSharpie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! play skullgirls~
[2:28:07] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus TOO MINMAXY Kappa
[2:28:09] <Djinnazz> yeah
[2:28:12] <%mitchteck> I only looked up stuff for 2nd playthroughs
[2:28:18] <%chll0ne> ^
[2:28:19] <%HostilePoundcakes> reminds me of the guy that has every trophy in the ps4 library
[2:28:20] <snakemuho> this blind is fighting final boss for 30 minutes because your build is shit
[2:28:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> MinhMax
[2:28:23] <derap41> Most likely Woolie would have borked that character and would be able to progress
[2:28:35] <%Redblood801> Skullgirls Launch Party NEVER ENDS!
[2:28:36] <%DaPurpleSharpie> bet
[2:28:38] <derap41> Wouldn't
[2:28:42] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus if you want your save fixed in under 5 mins, just check twitter DMs
[2:28:43] <donstylo> Woolie is a sexual Tyrannosaurus!
[2:28:47] <%DaPurpleSharpie> BETTTTT
[2:28:56] <+Estuko> @WoolieVersus ...playing Blind my first time with no knowledge of what anything meant = I literally crawled through most of this by the skin of my teeth with the cheapest tactics in existence
[2:28:57] <DatAsuna> get into lab time
[2:29:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> We've seen this channel do a similar game blind, nobody wants that.
[2:29:05] <%Irridium> so y'all playing skullgirls on Vita right Kappa
[2:29:08] <%DaPurpleSharpie> i have a character specialist i wanna bring too if that's okay. ik you like big band so he's got somettech for you
[2:29:11] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Woolie's style of LP and rpgs doesn't really mesh with rpgs blind, so I am happy Lil V is here to guide his hips
[2:29:19] <+oda_flobunaga> that's how its supposed to go
[2:29:19] <%chll0ne> the sad thing about persona 3,4 n 5 is that you HAVE to say certain things to really progress
[2:29:24] <derap41> Or even to figure out all the character mechanics
[2:29:30] <%chll0ne> 3 is especially brutal with social links
[2:29:30] <%gatorafan> Atton would still be Barth
[2:29:41] <%krispen_wa> Just got here, how far did they get?
[2:29:41] <DatAsuna> I'm compiling all of them. lol
[2:29:45] <%CEGold> I started playing this recently blind. I went to Korriban first. Mistakes were made. Oh god were mistakes made.
[2:29:48] <+prime_name> Atton would be slept on
[2:29:49] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus I'm pretty sure you have enough lightside points to do the thing
[2:29:51] <%Zohare> You are forced to miss two party characters too
[2:29:53] <%RioGascar> Problem is the time comittment i find with these games
[2:29:57] <zocano> I was all in on Kreia and Handmaiden my first playthrough
[2:30:04] <+oda_flobunaga> Playing Torment with low INT and WIS
[2:30:04] <%RioGascar> i beat them once and then just never replay em
[2:30:06] <%DensityD> "for those of you watching the anime, this is in a different tab and your focus is divided somewhere else" goddamn what a hot callout to the audience StinkyCheese
[2:30:07] <zocano> Bao-dur I missed cause his influence points are rare
[2:30:15] <notenoughgirls> good lord i cant even imagine korriban first
[2:30:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god, V knows Woolie too well.
[2:30:19] <+Urgoslav> Also don't full kiss her ass
[2:30:24] <%Redblood801> I hope Woolie gets styled on by Big Band again
[2:30:26] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It happens without him too, the twileks approach you anyway
[2:30:26] <KaitlynnHere> @gatorafan the only thing that carth and Atton have in common is that they’re child murders
[2:30:33] <subjectg> i got that one on accident i admit
[2:30:35] <+MidnightBurst12> I had a guide when I was a kid
[2:30:37] <DatAsuna> They just say something different before they talk to you
[2:30:41] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Its a good thing I love Atton, and I went to Narshada first
[2:30:41] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You don't actually have to have Atton in your party for that to work.
[2:30:44] <%DensityD> I'm suspicious that V has too much knowledge of all things
[2:30:45] <subjectg> but yeah they approach you no matter what
[2:30:53] <+Urgoslav> only if Atton is your boy
[2:31:07] <%Gruhunchously> But it works better the way you did it.
[2:31:31] <DatAsuna> just to change up the aesthetic
[2:31:39] <%krispen_wa> The Great Filter
[2:31:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:31:42] <penitentpentwitch> Star Wars, a Cosmic Horror Story where both sides are manipulated by self-serving bacteria that spreads itself across the galaxy via their hosts conflict, ensuring that civilization never advances past its current point.
[2:31:42] <dinnydanny777> Why is the Empire less technologically advanced than the Republic
[2:31:54] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus Bao Dur's pod and the Training droids used in the movies
[2:32:00] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus It's that the game devs wanted to make a Star Wars game, not a weird space game with magic samurai guys that is just called Star Wars.
[2:32:03] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus except when ep 9 makes all the books and cmics leding up to itmake no sense lol
[2:32:05] <+prime_name> It's even crazier in Fire Emblem's case. 2000 years have passed in one setting between games and it's still medvil sword fights
[2:32:22] <+oda_flobunaga> Its about the iconography, not the continuity
[2:32:25] <DatAsuna> There's a bunch of books that specifically set up the revvorow episode 9 instead of the abrams ep 9
[2:32:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Considering they murdered the EU, they BETTER be at least doing that.
[2:32:42] <%RioGascar> You could argue for the empire the galactic economy collapsed and thus tech regressed?
[2:32:46] <DatAsuna> *trevorrow
[2:32:54] <%krispen_wa> FFX already had technology, big idol concerts, and airships, and yet thousands of years pass to FF7 and it only just got slightly more advanced and steampunk
[2:32:59] <%Ipsenscastle> @prime_name Japan itself stayed medieval sword fighty for over 1000 years
[2:33:16] <%RioGascar> And then theres weird stuff
[2:33:17] <lotharrio> Yo here's a question: Where do all the humans come from?
[2:33:27] <+oda_flobunaga> Nomi SunDERE
[2:33:29] <%RioGascar> Like kaber crystals that deflect lightsabers
[2:33:31] <+oda_flobunaga> yep
[2:33:36] <+MidnightBurst12> ye
[2:33:37] <+SolidusRex> Luke also uses battle meditation in the Thrawn trilogy
[2:33:38] <dinnydanny777> Nomi means reading the mind of your opponent
[2:33:41] <%Redblood801> I believe that "new tech" is purely cosmetic and is literally the same tech as 1,000 years ago
[2:33:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ipsenscastle But a huge part of that was self-imposed isolation. So unless warp travel was LOST and thus planets were isolated for eons, it wouldn't be the same.
[2:33:55] <DatAsuna> It's what kreia told you happened to you
[2:34:02] <DatAsuna> but didn't actually
[2:34:04] <%RioGascar> why do they first exist back in god damn jedi outcast when theres barely any jedi or sith to really make worth an investment
[2:34:07] <donstylo> i don't know if it was in the old or new canon. But around 25k before the prequels there was humanoid like cat race that found some sort of arks giving them advanced technology.
[2:34:11] <$Fortunato5678> Don't worry about it
[2:34:11] <DatAsuna> It's the red herring of kotor 2
[2:34:12] <%Ipsenscastle> @CommanderSqueaks that was in reply to a thing about Fire Emblem, i agree re SW
[2:34:13] <lotharrio> That's what Kreia manipulated you into thinking.
[2:34:19] <+oda_flobunaga> Nomi SunDERE was the one to defeat Exar CHAN

[2:35:22] <%CEGold> SWTOR is aight
[2:35:23] <DatAsuna> Malak's the only one who actually has that
[2:35:36] <dinnydanny777> I want Mickey Mouse to get a lightsaber and become a Sith in Kingdom Hearts 4
[2:35:45] <dinnydanny777> He's already worn a black robe
[2:35:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 If Jedi aren't in Kingdom Hearts 4, what the fuck is even the point of Kingdom Hearts 4?
[2:36:03] <+prime_name> KOTOR
[2:36:08] <+oda_flobunaga> Pong
[2:36:09] <lotharrio> Xenogears, man.
[2:36:09] <DatAsuna> No games come to mind, but ghost in the shell as a kid was a wash for me
[2:36:11] <notenoughgirls> i want mickey to embrace sion's pain abilities
[2:36:12] <%Irridium> Planescape Torment for me LUL
[2:36:13] <%krispen_wa> Oh god

[2:36:30] <%Redblood801> OOF
[2:36:31] <%HostilePoundcakes> oof
[2:36:32] <%krispen_wa> AYN RANDIAN V
[2:36:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ghost in the shell.
[2:36:45] <+oda_flobunaga> 1st Torment Run Definately
[2:36:49] <penitentpentwitch> Yeah, that is a bad lesson that Min Maxing can teach
[2:36:57] <+SolidusRex> Ayyyn Randlmao
[2:37:01] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[2:37:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Little V "Man, Kreia's on point!"
[2:37:23] <%gatorafan> Littlest V
[2:37:33] <+Zouledge> LUL
[2:37:35] <+Arthasgnome> Actual human Sith Lord
[2:37:39] <penitentpentwitch> Kreia: "Good work Littlest V."
[2:37:39] <%krispen_wa> Little Zack Synder V
[2:37:41] <%SomersaultJustice> kotor corrupts the youth, got it
[2:37:42] <%RioGascar> i think the lesson i got from kotor 2 was black and white is not a way to think about situations
[2:37:47] <DatAsuna> Yeah just movies and tv for me
[2:37:47] <%RioGascar> as a kid
[2:37:50] <tonfirean> Yeah, maybe I have people-pleaser habits because of RPGs.
[2:37:54] <+oda_flobunaga> DMC 2?
[2:38:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Littlest V wearing a Kreia T-shirt.
[2:38:16] <astro_yojimbo> Omikron?
[2:38:17] <%Irridium> "wow titties!" - me young watching ghost in the shell
[2:38:17] <+SolidusRex> Cowboy Bebop was way over my level when I first saw it as a kid
[2:38:25] <%krispen_wa> Everyone misunderstood MGS2
[2:38:33] <dinnydanny777> Omikron is truly an eye opening experience when you think about it
[2:38:40] <tonfirean> ("what is the right thing to say in this situation?" rather than "what do I want to say in this situation?")
[2:38:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[2:38:44] <%RioGascar> I watched akira last year and i don’t understand that shit. But it looked cool at least
[2:38:47] <%chll0ne> gta v for me
[2:38:55] <dinnydanny777> Omikron is kind of harrowing, really
[2:39:09] <%krispen_wa> Night Mode Activated
[2:39:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @riogascar If you're not familiar with the economic crash of Japan in the 80's, Akira loses a lot of its context.
[2:39:40] <DatAsuna> If you're doing release order you have to skip season 7 then and do rebels lol
[2:39:43] <%RioGascar> Im aware now of the bubble thanks to yakuza 0 but not the crash
[2:39:46] <notenoughgirls> later episodes are intended to be prequels
[2:39:50] <lotharrio> Hellboy in chronological order is a hell of a trip.
[2:39:53] <%Irridium> @CommanderSqueaks and also the movie leaves out a LOT of stuff from the manga
[2:39:53] <%krispen_wa> So much Japanese media is a direct result of that bubble popping
[2:39:54] <%gatorafan> Little me only watched Evangelion for the girls daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:40:00] <a_mad_dragon> black jack's tankobon chapter orders WutFace
[2:40:16] <%Ipsenscastle> @lotharrio I feel like that would kind of ruin Hellboy
[2:40:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Ep 4,5,6, 1,2,3,7,8,9? though
[2:40:26] <%chll0ne> like BTAS
[2:40:26] <+absentpal> when is the skull girls lab episode? I don't wanna miss it
[2:40:31] <Psyramics> what about charts that tell you waht to skip cause they're garbage filler *cough*naruto*cough*bleach
[2:40:32] <Doodle_Taco> Madoka was probably that series that challenged me as a wee lad
[2:40:34] <DatAsuna> TCW fans are very defensive about it
[2:40:35] <dinnydanny777> I hate vague spoilers, they create impossible expectations
[2:40:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @irridium Akira is one of those anime that made me realize that WHEN something was made can provide a lot of context to WHY it's made the way it is.
[2:40:48] <%chll0ne> @raygekage 6-7pm tmw
[2:40:51] <DatAsuna> Yeah that's not it
[2:40:53] <dinnydanny777> Vague spoilers set people up for disappointment more than actual spoilers do
[2:40:54] <%RioGascar> i was happy i watched and played media that did teach me things that were above my level at times but helped me learn lessons
[2:41:00] <DatAsuna> It's more biblical
[2:41:11] <+absentpal> @cozygunna thank you!
[2:41:13] <%krispen_wa> Jacob styled on the Angel using sick force powers to get his blessing
[2:41:13] <+oda_flobunaga> YIN YANG
[2:41:21] <%Ipsenscastle> personifying the force misses the whole fucking point
[2:41:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Jacob "Gimma that force power!"
[2:41:27] <+oda_flobunaga> AGYO UNGYO
[2:41:27] <lotharrio> @Ipsenscastle Not really? It's a different read, but instead of being given questions that don't get answered for decades, you get premises and foreshadowing.
[2:41:30] <notenoughgirls> thanks george
[2:41:32] <%Zohare> Did Kishimoto write that part?
[2:41:34] <dinnydanny777> I can't stand knowing that some event is going to happen soon
[2:41:34] <DatAsuna> whiteblackgray
[2:41:34] <+HollowMan190> they do some RAD shit tho
[2:41:39] <%chll0ne> LUL LUL
[2:41:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> SO IT'S NARUTO!?
[2:41:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @lotharrio hmm interesting, i might give it a try!
[2:41:50] <+oda_flobunaga> Its just Kaguya
[2:41:53] <lotharrio> But what if you want to yell at it, @WoolieVersus ?
[2:41:55] <tonfirean> @WoolieVersus My impression was that Clone Wars was aired out of order and the chronological order is more or less the production-intended one, but I admit I haven't done the research.
[2:41:57] <DatAsuna> How do you feel about persona Q stories where everyone forgets at the end?
[2:41:59] <$Fortunato5678> Yes
[2:42:01] <%krispen_wa> For some reason I thought they were talking about Blackface George
[2:42:01] <+oda_flobunaga> the Whills
[2:42:04] <dinnydanny777> Like, imagine your watching a TV show and someone's like "hey this really cool thing is about to happen" and then it happens, and it's not as cool
[2:42:04] <%chll0ne> theyre not gods?
[2:42:11] <%HostilePoundcakes> yes Kappa
[2:42:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT'S LITTLE GODS IN YOUR CELLS
[2:42:13] <penitentpentwitch> Bacteria in the cells pretending to be Gods and the dead!
[2:42:16] <%jiggy_snipe> it's almost like the force should just be a force Kappa
[2:42:24] <%Ipsenscastle> it's a cute hilarious new character called Bar Bar Jinks, everyone's gonna love it
[2:42:26] <+absentpal> question for the chat, is skull girls mobile worth getting into until I can get it on PC?
[2:42:32] <Quiet__Viking> "It's Jar Jar"
[2:42:35] <dinnydanny777> The force is mitochondria so it's basically just blood magic
[2:42:39] <%chll0ne> should be neither!
[2:42:39] <notenoughgirls> jar jar is the key to everything
[2:42:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nanomachines
[2:42:46] <DatAsuna> Yeah check out skullgirls mobile
[2:42:49] <dinnydanny777> Can you use the force to boil people's blood?
[2:42:57] <Doodle_Taco> @woolieversus "Jar Jar is the key to all of this"
[2:42:59] <%karmahoudini_guitar> !uptime
[2:43:00] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 54 minutes
[2:43:00] <%RioGascar> i think theres should be less explanation of how thing works BUT you should create rules on what the thing can and can not do
[2:43:05] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus there is a really fun book series called Deathstalker, where they play with that concept
[2:43:08] <dinnydanny777> Force Reduce White Cell Count
[2:43:17] <%RioGascar> Like what can the force actually not do
[2:43:17] <%krispen_wa> Woolie is completely neutral, Goddamn gray jedi
[2:43:27] <%gatorafan> I don't know what this Force thing is, but it sounds disappointing.
[2:43:39] <DatAsuna> Planets were dying when malak took over
[2:43:43] <DatAsuna> Mandos only killed people
[2:43:45] <DatAsuna> malak killed planets
[2:43:52] <dinnydanny777> Force Cell Seperation
[2:44:04] <lotharrio> Malak was a planet glasser.
[2:44:06] <DatAsuna> Yeah, but that's just them saying it's worse after the fact
[2:44:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Revan had a plan. Malak was just a shit.
[2:44:17] <DatAsuna> I didn't say they're right, just that's how they weigh it.
[2:44:25] <dinnydanny777> Malak actively stabbed Revan in the back
[2:44:30] <+prime_name> Best master
[2:44:33] <dinnydanny777> Malak was a huge cowardly traitor
[2:44:35] <%krispen_wa> Malak put all his stat points into dumbass
[2:44:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 And bitch couldn't even do that right LUL
[2:44:40] <%Gruhunchously> She's definitely up there
[2:44:42] <+oda_flobunaga> Malak was a Meatbag
[2:44:48] <DatAsuna> YOu won't get a straight answer
[2:44:53] <%Gruhunchously> Malak was THE Meatbag
[2:44:59] <DatAsuna> ^
[2:45:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> ^
[2:45:08] <%BisoromiBear> I told you so!
[2:45:10] <Gorshum> ^
[2:45:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> "I told you so."
[2:45:26] <+BubbaRands> PREACH
[2:45:36] <%Gruhunchously> Because Jedi got to be cryptic and mysterious and shit

[2:46:02] <dinnydanny777> Malak really was just a bitch
[2:46:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> That book
[2:46:13] <+oda_flobunaga> @DatAsuna TBH both are Fucks
[2:46:21] <DatAsuna> pretty much
[2:46:27] <DatAsuna> visions are always bad
[2:46:29] <+vaporousTippler> It's what the children would have wanted.
[2:46:29] <dinnydanny777> Very heroic
[2:46:33] <DatAsuna> and always self fuffilling
[2:46:33] <dinnydanny777> Light Side
[2:46:35] <+prime_name> Proactive Murder Monks
[2:46:35] <+Arthasgnome> V that line of logic is stupid, you knowing and not preventing a tragedy does not make you as bad as the ones perpetrating it.
[2:46:37] <%alpacasintophats> thats a baby hitler thing right there
[2:46:43] <%gatorafan> He MUST win daedra1DrunkTibs
[2:47:05] <dinnydanny777> Anakin was destined to bring peace to the galaxy
[2:47:09] <R3c0n31> relying on future sight will always lead to bad end
[2:47:12] <DatAsuna> Oh no i made the vision happen by trying to stop it
[2:47:14] <benjehuda> 🌔
[2:47:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kalamari?
[2:47:24] <+SinisterBroccoli> V why are you looking at woolie like Palpatine? LUL
[2:47:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Do it"
[2:47:33] <dinnydanny777> Anakin was destined to bring peace to the galaxy and he did
[2:47:33] <notenoughgirls> palpatine after vader finds out padme died: thats rough buddy
[2:47:40] <%RioGascar> And anakin did bring peace...it was just light side SUPER LATER
[2:47:44] <R3c0n31> 10/10 pun, get out
[2:47:47] <%SomersaultJustice> oh no I super forgot how to play skullgirls
[2:47:54] <%krispen_wa> is there a piece of media where a dude just ignores a vision and it fails to come through?
[2:47:54] <+oda_flobunaga> Truff
[2:47:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[2:47:58] <%jiggy_snipe> kyh9 is right
[2:48:12] <tonfirean> Gives "Persona" a whole new meaning.
[2:48:35] <lotharrio> Loved in Dragon Age, where you could just shovel cakes into the face of your party members to improve their influence.
[2:48:48] <penitentpentwitch> How to Win at Life, Volume 1
