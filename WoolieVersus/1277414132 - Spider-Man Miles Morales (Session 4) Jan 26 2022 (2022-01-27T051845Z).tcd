Jamil Neate was a cool character though, what if Amuro failed to prevent the colony drop, he just becomes a cooler Quattro Bajeena. Turn A Gundam next on the list.

[0:33:31] <%golforo> At least he isn't as evil as Spiderverse
[0:33:33] <casualshinji> This game really improved on the Boss fights compared to the previous game.

[0:37:44] <DSD24> @ToastyBroDude Exactly man! its always looks so silly when the man on the floor starts talking shit
[0:37:44] <casualshinji> Miles' Prowler suit looks better than the actual Prowler suit.
[0:37:58] <%Shad0wTag> I will be a mark for the STRIKE suit but this works too
[0:38:03] <+DatAsuna> the pants are hilarious to me

[0:50:43] <%dds333a> @sirjames079 not every game can be Arkham Asylum Kappa
[0:50:44] <%notsoy> NEVER KILLED A MAN IN HIS LIFE
[0:50:48] <casualshinji> @sirjames079 Straight-up fighting is WAY more fun anyway.
[0:50:52] <mar_krow> Zipping around just seems fun
[0:50:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> big whiffs
[0:50:59] <Aussie_Manny> It's clobberin' time.
[0:51:05] <+Deosier> it was a warning boulder
[0:51:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> just throwin trash for fun
[0:51:12] <deviljhojho_> from soft to hard in .000001 seconds
[0:51:22] <%BlondieFDM> Miles's aim was really trash there
[0:51:36] <%X2Eliah> Hes also dead
[0:51:39] <%X2Eliah> drowned
[0:51:41] <+Jiggisnipe> um
[0:51:46] <+Grayhammatter> drowned that guy
[0:51:47] <Aussie_Manny> Take a dip!
[0:51:54] <%golforo> Nasty Manhattan water
[0:51:56] <+Jiggisnipe> was he conscious cuz if not...
[0:51:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Henchman Dipping
[0:52:01] <+Grayhammatter> that guy got monk dipped
[0:52:06] <+Juriasu> it's alright, miles made a breahting apparatus out of the webs before he pnched them into the water
[0:52:38] <+Jiggisnipe> SCIENCE
[0:52:43] <Aussie_Manny> They look like GLaDOS.
[0:52:52] <+Rafraud> oh god this
[0:52:58] <+condemned_15> look at the yellow cables
[0:53:01] <DSD24> Some kind of Web Ball maybe?
[0:53:10] <+Rafraud> This puzzle sucks lol
[0:53:14] <%emptyantics> Web is a convinient problem solver lol
[0:53:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie WILL figure it out
[0:53:49] <DSD24> The spin!
[0:53:54] <+condemned_15> Think like Gyro
[0:54:03] <leomuratore> doodBigBrain
[0:54:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> gyromancy
[0:54:29] <+Rafraud> Woolie almost spoiling
[0:54:38] <%Shad0wTag> GYROMANCY HAS FORETOLD
[0:54:42] <IvanMistwalker> Miles have mastered the art of HAMON
[0:54:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis no spoil
[0:55:03] <skewerstar> Aren't web supposed to insulate though? Or do Miles' webs specifically conduct electricity?
[0:55:04] <DSD24> I always thought that was so lame

[0:55:05] <+condemned_15> No Way Home gonna hit digital in February
[0:55:15] <DSD24> Make the mask cool then and people would be into it
[0:55:16] <sirjames079> Which sucks tbh. If you're playing a hero with a mask then keep the mask on!
[0:55:20] <+Rafraud> Gotta have your actor hero moment Kappa
[0:55:24] <+TheMilkiestShake> Do you thinmk it's the actors thinking that or the producers who spent a lot of money on them want to show their faces?
[0:55:36] <fluke_LKZ> That's why Karl Urban's Dredd is sick.
[0:55:41] <%jonblnt> Dafoe doesn’t need a mask to make him menacing
[0:55:41] <fluke_LKZ> Mask on at all time.
[0:55:53] <+Rafraud> Simply release the movie you cowards
[0:55:57] <%dds333a> @fluke_lkz never takes it off, with the scowl to match LUL
[0:56:00] <alphalejandro> Yes, December's now Spidey month...for some reason
[0:56:06] <brachydios777> Mandalorian also GOAT
[0:56:12] <+Rafraud> Previous record: 1 dollar
[0:56:19] <+condemned_15> Scream 5 almost beat SpiderMan for a weekend
[0:56:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> broke records for most sweaty dorks in one enclosed room during a pandemic
[0:56:28] <leomuratore> When you're at zero, everything is a record.
[0:56:28] <IvanMistwalker> LUL
[0:56:29] <%hereiam407> LUL
[0:56:39] <%X2Eliah> just link the cables
[0:56:41] <DSD24> is Scream 5 any good
[0:56:47] <+Rafraud> this puzzle SUCKS
[0:56:47] <%Shad0wTag> @themilkiestshake Considering how in the past this didn't seem to be an issue or bother actors as much. S
[0:56:50] <%Lion_kun> Dafoe was fantastic in NWH
[0:56:53] <+Rafraud> Its such a slowdown lol
[0:56:59] <+S3xGAZEBO> done recording? that was a short stream lol
[0:56:59] <+condemned_15> @DSD24 eh. It's ok. Better than 4 in my opinion

[0:57:39] <%X2Eliah> why
[0:57:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> miles hates scaffolding
[0:58:03] <$thotbane> @ReallyBigRocks he saw the John Wilson episode so he knows its a scam
[0:58:04] <alphalejandro> Nice
[0:58:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you did it
[0:58:33] <HawkGoggles2> It looks nice
[0:58:35] <brachydios777> There we go
[0:58:37] <%elderpunch> this puzzle was a pain in the ass
[0:58:41] <NeonBleu> Scientist like the view
[0:58:43] <+condemned_15> if something explodes, just push it into the water
[0:58:43] <%X2Eliah> Oceanography was really popular in the 60s
[0:58:49] <MadBaller123> and Montreal's architecture museum too!
[0:58:51] <LeeOhX> gotta have that vista
[0:58:57] <leomuratore> "Time for the final mission, but hey here's a slow puzzle for you first"
[0:59:01] <%emptyantics> Just gotta talk it out

[1:00:18] <MadBaller123> Nice arena
[1:00:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @samuraiknack fought prowler then big puzzle
[1:00:22] <%Shad0wTag> @samuraiknack The Prowler boss fight
[1:00:25] <+condemned_15> tech parts during missions don't count towards completion
[1:00:33] <Aussie_Manny> Maaaaaybe.
[1:00:34] <brachydios777> hmmmmmm
[1:00:35] <Aussie_Manny> I hope so.
[1:00:40] <%Shad0wTag> Isn't the Symbiote in this world man made like the Ultimate Universe?
[1:00:41] <+samuraiknack> Thanks guys
[1:00:42] <leomuratore> Absolutely.
[1:00:49] <+Juriasu> space shuttles are so fucking cool
[1:00:58] <MadBaller123> venom abilities are going to get confusing in the sequel...
[1:01:02] <+JonathLP> Normal trip? Wasn't it in an alien space station during secret war?
[1:01:03] <+SuperUnhappyman> OLD MAN MILES OUTFIT
[1:01:06] <leith_aziz> Hi chat. Made sure to catch up on rest of stream cohhNotes
[1:01:07] <alphalejandro> @Shad0wTag We don't know yet, wait to Spidey 2
[1:01:07] <sirjames079> Man the actual character won't be in the sequel but I hope we at least get an Agent Venom costume there, I love that design
[1:01:10] <zerointelligence000> I mean the original Pete picked it up from battle world but I doubt we're getting that
[1:01:22] <+dekkitout> Original Venom was basically space flex tape
[1:01:24] <casualshinji> Get ready for the biggest buzzkill.
[1:01:30] <leith_aziz> Agent Venom cohhPog
[1:01:30] <brachydios777> We don't know 100 % if the symbiote is man made
[1:01:32] <Aussie_Manny> That sounds insane.
[1:01:39] <%Shad0wTag> @alphalejandro I thought the post credit scenes implied it was man made?
[1:01:42] <%dds333a> back when it was just the black suit LUL
[1:01:45] <+Juriasu> Norman Osborn wants to build rapture huh
[1:01:48] <leomuratore> They might just do that again

[1:01:50] <%dds333a> and then Sarah Carpenter got it
[1:01:51] <+JonathLP> OLD HAIR

[1:02:32] <%X2Eliah> feesh
[1:02:35] <zerointelligence000> Lee?
[1:02:36] <DSD24> Eww no
[1:02:37] <Aussie_Manny> In many origin stories, JJJ's astronaut son John is the one who accidentally picks up a bit of the symbiote on his ship. I'm wondering how Venom got here in the game-verse for the sequel. 🤔
[1:02:38] <Futurecity10> Is that Lee?
[1:02:38] <+SolidusRex> Hey Lee
[1:02:39] <%hereiam407> Lee
[1:02:41] <+TheMilkiestShake> I want more superheros that are just thick as shit

[1:02:53] <casualshinji> 'Let's put a slow-walking flashback sequence right before the big final Boss climax.' Genius!

[1:04:07] <casualshinji> That's because you never ate it with mashed potatoes Miles.
[1:04:08] <%golforo> Norman with the waves

[1:04:40] <%dds333a> harry had Skelton waves
[1:04:41] <+dekkitout> Sadly, Harry's son Normie aint got a wave cap

[1:05:50] <fluke_LKZ> Spider-Man underwater, just like a Marvel Team Up with Namor.
[1:05:52] <MadBaller123> there's a reason why eldritch creatures look like sea creatures
[1:05:53] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> deep sea just crushes you into nothing, at least space gives you a minute to gtf back in lol

[1:20:59] <casualshinji> I don't mind game segments like this, but don't make it a flashback, and DON'T put it at the very end of the game right before the final Boss fight.
[1:21:02] <KeiganOfAstora> I feel bad for the people that wrote the fluff dialogue knowing most people won't hear it or skip it
[1:21:06] <%Shad0wTag> @keiganofastora I think this is intersting personally
[1:21:10] <+Hollow_Mirage> Why does Oscorp have a NASA rocket?
[1:21:10] <+CrimKangaroo> yes, sexy "cannibalism"

[1:22:46] <%X2Eliah> Nuclear? PFFFFT just burn coal
[1:22:48] <Darkdrill> space is overhyped there is not much going on there
[1:22:50] <casualshinji> I've seen Gravity, I know what happens up there.
[1:22:54] <%jepupu> Artificial gravity/centrifugal stuff sounds important judging by how the blood of current astronauts starts thinning a lot in the ISS.
[1:22:58] <+CrimKangaroo> the ISS has serious funk, apparently
[1:23:00] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhhh shit..
[1:23:01] <leith_aziz> Pfffft, tell the millitary that

[1:24:43] <zerointelligence000> "Give me the Yamato"
[1:24:45] <Treasure_Vault> Say it faster, dumbass
[1:24:45] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:24:49] <casualshinji> @emptyantics Also, Phin should've just been a way better written.
[1:24:51] <LeeOhX> more super heroes need a hoodie
[1:24:52] <leomuratore> @emptyantics Right? It could've been anytime in the game
[1:24:52] <Darkdrill> get that lady
[1:24:56] <KeiganOfAstora> Fuck, I missed the Prowler fight
[1:25:00] <deviljhojho_> we're taking the christmas brawl from family members to close friends
[1:25:01] <sirjames079> Phin sucks
[1:25:03] <KeiganOfAstora> Was the Prowler fight on this stream or last stream?
[1:25:03] <GHouseduivel> Isn't that a jacket though
[1:25:04] <%elderpunch> this could all be avoided if phin just listened
[1:25:06] <sandwhichpeddler> Why is her reaction time better than Miles shes literally just a person
[1:25:08] <leith_aziz> @KeiganOfAstora Here, here pickyO7
[1:25:11] <deviljhojho_> it happened like an hour ago
[1:25:16] <kulmoth> phin is a bad person and a bad friend
[1:25:16] <+Rafraud> Idk what they could have done to make Phin more understandable cause like, she's not lol
[1:25:17] <+vaderxyz1970> Tinkerer more like gaslighter
[1:25:18] <+condemned_15> I feel like Phin's writing just drops after the Rhino fight
[1:25:18] <KeiganOfAstora> @leith_aziz Fuck, that musta been while I was driving home and I didn't realize lol
[1:25:27] <%Shad0wTag> @keiganofastora This strea.
[1:25:29] <leith_aziz> @KeiganOfAstora It's this stream. Not that far off
[1:25:29] <%elderpunch> @condemned_15 TEP
[1:25:35] <%elderpunch> YEP
[1:25:37] <%dds333a> YER DONE
[1:25:40] <Treasure_Vault> "My brother would hate that his work will kill people, so I must kill people to stop it"
[1:25:44] <sirjames079> I feel like it might be a result of the game's shorter length more than anything but Phin really comes across badly
[1:25:44] <+UmbraMuninn> hello everyone :)
[1:25:45] <deviljhojho_> the only way to make phin seem omre understandable woulda been to make miles way more of a fuck up i think
[1:25:51] <KeiganOfAstora> I was driving home from work and he was doing some mission at this island area outside of Manhattan. Was that it?
[1:25:51] <Martinet111> I hope Doc Ock says it in this
[1:25:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> dead
[1:26:18] <+Grayhammatter> Dead
[1:26:18] <%dds333a> we got free fall kombat Kappa

[1:26:23] <%Shad0wTag> @keiganofastora He went straight to the boss fight
[1:26:34] <deviljhojho_> sacrifice your thumbs for the culture
[1:26:45] <%elderpunch> I also never understood how phin could keep up w miles physically
[1:26:46] <GHouseduivel> Fist to the top of the head, they dead dawg
[1:27:00] <deviljhojho_> she does cardio
[1:27:00] <sandwhichpeddler> "You dont understand, you lied to me Miles" *blows up the city*

[1:28:28] <VincentGraves> christ the ragdolls
[1:28:29] <alphalejandro> For enemies that block, hold square to uppercut
[1:28:30] <+Hollow_Mirage> I’m pretty sure eco fighters shouldn’t be saying “we’re the strongest”
[1:28:32] <Zezinizzle> yo has woolie reacted to bomb rush cyberfunk??

[1:28:52] <@Solidus_113> final mission
[1:28:58] <+Rafraud> this part is BASED
[1:28:59] <%Shad0wTag> WORLD CHANGE
[1:29:02] <%dds333a> @datasuna at least one could say it's Prowler's full suit
[1:29:03] <DSD24> Aren't all the Underground members puppy kickers?
[1:29:16] <Aussie_Manny> This really is feeling like endgame.
[1:29:18] <+Rafraud> Hypest world state
[1:29:18] <leith_aziz> I like when the setting changes for the finale
[1:29:25] <leith_aziz> SPider-Man did that for the whole 3rd act
[1:29:25] <%BlondieFDM> "How are you doing tonight, Spider-man" a civilian asks while a warzone is happening
[1:29:30] <leith_aziz> *Spider
[1:29:35] <%Shad0wTag> Its a shame Woolie didn't go with the green and purple suit for maximum colours
[1:29:40] <%dds333a> CHAOS
[1:29:46] <sirjames079> The state change in Spidey PS4 was so cool, the city felt totally different in the second half
[1:29:48] <+BDazl> Miles Prower Fursuit?
[1:29:52] <alphalejandro> Criminals just raid the city all lead by Otto and his sinister group
[1:29:52] <%elderpunch> i havent replayed the first spiderman ps4 in a min
[1:29:55] <leith_aziz> Huh, we havent gotten much of JJ here. Shame
[1:29:57] <%dds333a> he does talk about it, a lot LUL
[1:29:58] <+UmbraMuninn> Masked vigilante mayhem!
[1:29:59] <crazy_riggs> At the game even jamison was like "alright, that was a horrible situation, I'll give Spiderman a pass this ONE TIME!"
[1:30:00] <Darkdrill> look at how's he swings it's way different compared to the start of the game
[1:30:04] <DSD24> I should replay Spiderman PS4
[1:30:08] <DSD24> Its been awhile
[1:30:28] <%elderpunch> @DSD24 i enjoy the swinging in this game so much more
[1:30:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:30:32] <leith_aziz> I dont play on PS4 anymore, so I'll have to hope for a PC port GOW style
[1:30:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> "Stop the war"
[1:30:35] <+condemned_15> watch out for Pyramid Head
[1:30:43] <coreybom> Jameson in the finale was actually subdued. Even he knew shit was bad.
[1:30:45] <Zezinizzle> @elderpunch it's pretty identical apart from new animations
[1:30:46] <GHouseduivel> The snake, the cat, the rat, the dog, how you gonna seem them, when you livin in the fog.
[1:30:46] <NeonBleu> spine defeated
[1:30:53] <%Shad0wTag> @crazy_riggs I mean after a plague breaks out nearly killing everyone you can't NOT give him a break
[1:31:03] <deviljhojho_> Kill them all miles
[1:31:15] <DSD24> @elderpunch I never actually played Miles so that'd be a first playthrough for me
[1:31:15] <%elderpunch> @Zezinizzle the tricks are much more easier to pull off
[1:31:17] <%mr_sups> THE CRISIS
[1:31:18] <sirjames079> @leith_aziz I have the same issue, I keep meaning to finish Trails of Cold Steel 4 but I got it on PS4 and I'm too lazy to set that up again lol
[1:31:27] <BlackermanZX> Blaster Master what a great game
[1:31:30] <leith_aziz> I was thinking of Infinite Earths for a sec
[1:31:33] <%elderpunch> using square feels way better than using circle n trisaangle
[1:31:47] <+dekkitout> Aw man, not another Crisis. People just got used to having their old parents
[1:31:55] <Zezinizzle> I just wish we could do loops while swinging like the old games
[1:32:02] <Zezinizzle> instead of being forced to let go of your web
[1:32:04] <DSD24> Shield Bash!
[1:32:07] <+Juriasu> BLOCKED

[1:33:16] <coreybom> I honestly can’t wait for Spider-Man 2. Just from that teaser showing some new peter stuff and this is making so hype.

[2:02:19] <%elderpunch> @WoolieVersus https://twitter.com/thechaseconley/status/1169089308558409728
[2:02:20] <+JonathLP> Playable Next-Gen Venom? *drools*
[2:02:22] <Aussie_Manny> Aaron turned himself in. Aaron was able to make a plea deal and reduce his sentence to two years in exchange for Krieger's arrest.
[2:02:24] <+theoldone001> A lot of context is missed by not playing Spider-Man 2018
[2:02:26] <+CrimKangaroo> wait out for mecha-phin in the miles sequel
[2:02:30] <%Prevot> like... giving Peter a symbiote? LUL
[2:02:30] <alphalejandro> Reggie, Harry is Venom in this universe
[2:02:33] <leith_aziz> I feel like Coop is something you see less and less of in this day and age
[2:02:34] <+Axellogic> right now miles is just better
[2:02:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Yoooo what if in Spider-man 2 you defeat Harry Venom and the symbiote finds Eddie and you get to play as Peter, Miles and Eddie????
[2:02:36] <+kewlmyc> Problem is that MIles is just better Spiderman. They're going to have to give Peter a lot of shit.
[2:02:37] <nintega010> I hope you can  play as venom
[2:02:39] <GHouseduivel> @elderpunch LUL
[2:02:42] <+DatAsuna> Fristom and GengLee have the 2 best swinging systems out there
[2:02:45] <+samuraiknack> MODERN DAY???
[2:02:46] <Aussie_Manny> @elderpunch lytKEK
[2:02:46] <leith_aziz> Give me a Arkham Knight tag team mechanic at least
[2:02:48] <%mr_sups> Miles gets venom, Peter gets Tech, VENOM gets Symbiote powers
[2:02:49] <garcia64> Have they watched the Spider-Man 2 teaser ?
[2:02:51] <casualshinji> How are they going to make Peter's combat as satisfying as Miles' though?
[2:02:51] <%jinking79> r they even gonna do cletus in this game
[2:03:01] <Daxalog> good luck doing that shit now
[2:03:02] <Darkdrill> point to point swinging is hella dope. ( he made to game a gem )
[2:03:04] <%dds333a> @kewlmyc he gets Iron Spider
[2:03:06] <willyfreshness> And made the most iconic Spiderman movement for 20 years
[2:03:07] <+S3xGAZEBO> what a gangsta
[2:03:08] <+DrFacilier> imagine having developers like that nowadays
[2:03:09] <+FuqBoiSlim> hey guys I got in late. wtf the game's over???
[2:03:10] <coreybom> @kewlmyc Judging by the teaser, they are. It seems he has his arms as extra for combat.
[2:03:10] <Dr_Mooose> saved a franchise
[2:03:10] <+Juriasu> better than the pizza music????
[2:03:11] <alphalejandro> @mr_sups Venom get Venom LUL
[2:03:11] <%Bread_Assassin> They should add in SpiderGwen while they’re at it.
[2:03:15] <leith_aziz> @FuqBoiSlim Sorry
[2:03:19] <BlackermanZX> what a chad
[2:03:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> The fact that your webs wrapped around corners in SpiderMan 2 was insane
[2:03:22] <+DatAsuna> He got paid in exposure, says woolie xD
[2:03:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> He's basically spiderman
[2:03:26] <%baka_sugoi> He saved Spider-Man
[2:03:30] <%Prevot> I want Venom to get his own small game like this after 2
[2:03:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> and then botched a Kickstarter didnt he?
[2:03:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> oh no
[2:03:44] <Zezinizzle> @reallybigrocks yeah stuff like that is missing from these new games
[2:03:46] <+DatAsuna> Yeah energy hook didn't make much money
[2:03:46] <+ElDragon_1> I'd love to see what Venom gameplay would be like
[2:03:48] <Darkdrill> sky swinging is lame
[2:03:52] <@Solidus_113> ultimate spiderman is good
[2:03:55] <+DatAsuna> So that name cred didn't go far
[2:03:56] <DSD24> Swinging off clouds
[2:03:57] <GHouseduivel> SpiderMan on the PS1/N64
[2:03:58] <+Grayhammatter> sky swining is lame
[2:04:04] <sirjames079> Sky swinging is lame but those games can still be pretty fun
[2:04:05] <+FuqBoiSlim> @leith_aziz I knew we were kinda at the end last stream but I didn't it'd be over so soon lmao
[2:04:07] <%foxrock8> fun movement makes every inbetween moment potentially cool
[2:04:07] <masterfire23> they should have gotten that guy for marvels avengers
[2:04:09] <+DatAsuna> Lotta respect, not a lot of money
[2:04:09] <%elderpunch> @ElDragon_1 ultimate spider-man for gamecube
[2:04:13] <%Prevot> @eldragon_1 every normal punch is like miles venom punches LUL
[2:04:13] <leith_aziz> Web of Shadows, Ultimate Spiderman, PS4. Great swinging
[2:04:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, but can you get dumb big electrified web punching gloves like in SM2: Enter Electro????
[2:04:15] <alphalejandro> The first really good Spider-Man game was the first one on the PS1
[2:04:17] <Aussie_Manny> Oh hell yeah!
[2:04:19] <+JonathLP> Miles, Peter and Venom?
[2:04:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Thats a real one
[2:04:24] <casualshinji> Tony Todd is going to be Venom by the way. Candyman himself.
[2:04:24] <sirjames079> Miles and Peter, Double Kamen Riders- Spider-Men lets go !
[2:04:25] <fluke_LKZ> Co-Op Spider-Maning would be sick.
[2:04:25] <Zezinizzle> I just hope loops and webs wrapping around buildings returns

[2:59:54] <tentavision> then speedball made a self torture suit
[2:59:55] <%dds333a> most of Stamford up in dust
[2:59:57] <+DatAsuna> those kids were crisis actors
[2:59:57] <crazy_riggs> Guy would serve time in prison, and while being asked to support the new hero bill, was shot

[2:59:58] <Aussie_Manny> Peter should definitely take a teaching job by next game.
[2:59:58] <CappuccinoGuil> "Found him dumpster diving"
[3:00:01] <+FennecZephyr> IIRC when Otto was in Peter's body he punched Scorpion's jaw off
[3:00:02] <Nmiser> Yeah a bit better of a catalyst for civil war than the movie's
[3:00:04] <Aussie_Manny> I WANNA SEE THAT
[3:00:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Also Speedball became Penance
[3:00:09] <%jinking79> they don't blame the Villain they blame the heroes

[3:00:52] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, the movie ver of Civil War doesn't hit anywhere near as hard
[3:01:01] <@Solidus_113> And so begins the Hero Association in One Punch Man
[3:01:03] <ohno58> I though Nitro was the one who blew up?
[3:01:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Also, Tony originally HATED the registration act!
[3:01:04] <willyfreshness> Iron Man mightve been right
[3:01:08] <%elderpunch> @Aussie_Manny xmen were super right for staying away
[3:01:10] <TigerClaws12> Hero Association? Keepo
[3:01:16] <Dhamilt> That's why Speedball is a interesting character backstory
[3:01:19] <Nmiser> Literally just the Hero Association for OPM
[3:01:21] <mrtanaka111> marvel shit the bed after that
[3:01:27] <+ItsSleepyBoi> it would have been fine if you didnt have to unmask yourself
[3:01:27] <brachydios777> Carol Danvers character assasination
[3:01:31] <fluke_LKZ> Iron Man had a point, but they had to make him out as a bad guy for the whole Taking Sides thing.
[3:01:35] <%dds333a> @nmiser just before, obviously LUL
[3:01:35] <+Jiggisnipe> the logic is there. it's like a citizen's arrest which is just false imprisonment if you're wrong
[3:01:35] <+OroOreo> Venture bros level of aggression
[3:01:41] <%elderpunch> @Dhamilt did u see the yt video about him
[3:01:41] <+FadingEmber> Cap was wrong don't @ me
[3:01:48] <%MajorCrasher> works for Batman lol
[3:01:51] <alphalejandro> No, the problem was that the New Warriors were filming the whole thing, everyone in the world watch that school get blew up
[3:01:54] <coreybom> @willyfreshness Ehhh, Tony did some FUCKED up shit in the comics. Some real facist shit.
[3:01:59] <+ItsSleepyBoi> would batman be pro-ironman?
[3:01:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:02:00] <CeJaxon> Civil war 2 is just about a kid whos power was minority report and captain marvel was totally fine using it to run the world like a totalitarian regime
[3:02:00] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:02:00] <%Pillagius> So Batwoman from Batwoman show is out?
[3:02:00] <+DatAsuna> Honestly it feels like the sides shoulda been switch, Cap ont he side of institutional reform and Tony on the side of all the power in the hands of a privledged few. lol
[3:02:01] <%debrv> and spiderman got dumped on the HARDEST.
[3:02:02] <willyfreshness> Nah The Punisher can handle Galactus
[3:02:03] <Aussie_Manny> Fucking John Walker...
[3:02:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Also Tony had to speak for the bill, because if he didn't someone worse would
[3:02:04] <+condemned_15> uuhhhh
[3:02:05] <GHouseduivel> Yeah but the Guild and OSI were the regulation that normies didn't see

[3:02:30] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Didn't some reporter "Ok Boomer" Cap at some point during Civil War
[3:02:30] <+OzdotTV> although comics Civil War had an interesting premise, it kinda sucked and made both Steve & Tony very unlikeable
[3:02:35] <%Prevot> better dead than auth
[3:02:35] <Daxalog> Unless its Warhammer cause thats over the top
[3:02:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> "Hey, who's the main supporter for the bill?" "Frank Castle." "Fuuuuuuck."
[3:02:52] <%hereiam407> What is peace? There is no peace.
[3:02:52] <+badhaye> civil War 2 was a fun read
[3:02:56] <+DatAsuna> But it's also good not to go into the other end of "This one private interest should control it all instead" which a lot of billionaire hero characters end up as
[3:03:04] <brachydios777> The identity shoul be known by SHEILD or something not the public
[3:03:09] <%emptyantics> Only part of Civil War that was good was the Captain speach to Peter
[3:03:12] <willyfreshness> civil war 2 was asss
[3:03:14] <Dakuu75> @alteisenreisez Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck lol
[3:03:30] <alphalejandro> The New idiots (Warriors) were doing some kind of reality super hero show at that time
[3:03:31] <%hereiam407> Politics, economics, the arms race - they're all just arenas for meaningless competition.
[3:03:31] <ohno58> marvel comics have been ass since like 2015
[3:03:33] <+DatAsuna> cause ultimately the avengers are just one billionaire bankrolling him and his buddies to do whatever they want
[3:03:34] <+condemned_15> giant lobster

[3:03:37] <%dds333a> Cap isn't exactly for power in the hands of some, just freedom to self-regulate. issue is. the irony of cap being against registration is funny because he got his start as THE registered superhero
[3:03:37] <%emptyantics> Civil War 2 was garbagio
[3:03:38] <Burdenslo> @brachydios777 but hydra would just leak all the names

[3:04:23] <+badhaye> Civil War 2 was fun because it was just Minority Report
[3:04:25] <%dds333a> Hill
[3:04:26] <Aussie_Manny> Nick is off-world, and Maria Hill ain't Nick.
[3:04:32] <+DatAsuna> You can see how the super hero power fantasy ends up appealing to guys like snyder in the end with his randian lens on shit.
[3:04:32] <masterfire23> what about secret invasion
[3:04:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Mom and her ladder strike again!
[3:04:33] <alphalejandro> Giant Enemy...Lobster?

[3:04:49] <HawkGoggles2> Most shell fish is great
[3:04:49] <coreybom> @jinking79 Cap didn’t beat up the punisher for that. He beat franks ass cause frank murdered two villains who saw the error of their ways and wanted to help the heroes.
[3:04:51] <%elderpunch> @DatAsuna its embarrassing lol
[3:04:52] <TigerClaws12> too much work
[3:04:58] <+capybruhArt> need more horizontal and community based superhero structures
