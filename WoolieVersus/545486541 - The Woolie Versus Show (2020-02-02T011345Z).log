[0:00:00] <$burgersama_dlx> pretty relaxing saturday tbh, played some dragon quest, had some funyuns...good times
[0:00:11] <MojoKingIzakku> i hear no crackle
[0:00:12] <NeroInfinite> smoof now
[0:00:13] <%CJett92> audio is better!
[0:00:14] <rumblebunni> Fkxed!
[0:00:16] <doggieo> smooooth
[0:00:18] <some_sunflowers> is good.
[0:00:19] <+Ryu_R> saved?
[0:00:22] <zayasu> @WoolieVersus it sounds better just the camera choppy
[0:00:23] <%Solidnick18> now it sounds nice
[0:00:24] <$burgersama_dlx> perfect now PokPikachu
[0:00:25] <%optimasmaximas> @velestionhammer is that a board game?
[0:00:27] <PsideFxX> It's good
[0:00:27] <redrins> camera is choppy still
[0:00:30] <+steelmorrigan> Perfectu
[0:00:33] <+MrProw> YOU DID IT WOOLIE
[0:00:34] <velestionhammer> like dungeons and dragons
[0:00:34] <+Javaa01> Audio is good, the webcam is a bit choppy still
[0:00:38] <DracaenaLeaf> Camera shouldn
[0:00:42] <velestionhammer> Sound is good, guys. Thank you.
[0:00:48] <%CJett92> now camera is smooth?
[0:00:49] <VJdarkworld> audio fixed, but camera choppy
[0:00:49] <DracaenaLeaf> 't matter for now because we can hear y'all fine
[0:00:50] <+Carquar> I think it's frozen
[0:00:50] <@Solidus_113> Wouldn't it be better for the overall resolution to be lower, and the bitrate higher? Twitch's dynamic bitrate makes it so fast-moving images drop the stream's quality in favor of a smooth framerate
[0:00:56] <+botchdogg> @burgersama_dlx which dragon quest did you play?
[0:01:08] <MojoKingIzakku> yeah once reggie started moving the camera started acting up
[0:01:13] <soycristian31> sbfpYeyeye
[0:01:18] <+steelmorrigan> it's not consistent chop
[0:01:20] <NeroInfinite> the frames are skippin on Reggie
[0:01:25] <Sedrelic> +bitrate - resolution
[0:01:33] <$burgersama_dlx> @botchdogg going through XI S - just hit post game and can't believe theres so much more
[0:01:47] <$burgersama_dlx> just dont move
[0:01:48] <+Ryu_R> reggie on that king crimson drip
[0:01:51] <MojoKingIzakku> okay that's just how it is for right now
[0:01:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> Just don't move LUL
[0:01:59] <mankeyfigh> This is fine
[0:02:00] <@Solidus_113> we need... more power
[0:02:04] <zayasu> not that big of a deal honestly
[0:02:04] <london_flexing> New Camera?
[0:02:05] <NJigglypuff> if it wont show up in the recording then it's mostly fine
[0:02:06] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @burgersama_dlx It's less so a postgame, more of an Act 3.
[0:02:18] <mankeyfigh> Lets leave it
[0:02:25] <DracaenaLeaf> it's not, yeah
[0:02:26] <soycristian31> its fine like this
[0:02:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> Is the higher resolution really worth it?
[0:02:31] <$burgersama_dlx> @TitaniumDragoonNeo that's what I've been told, I'm glad it's not over tbh
[0:02:34] <MojoKingIzakku> yeah we can hear fine, and that's the important part
[0:02:34] <$burgersama_dlx> LOL
[0:02:35] <%Binary_Fireball> it's fine
[0:02:36] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:02:42] <london_flexing> It looks good, don't worry about it
[0:02:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[0:02:50] <CrimsonCore90> Get that man some shades!
[0:02:52] <zayasu> yes :)
[0:02:54] <%Prevot> I can't believe minh is fucking dead
[0:02:54] <%Irridium> I mean you are looking pretty crispt
[0:02:55] <%wolfofsound> I love woolie pores Kreygasm
[0:02:58] <+Javaa01> It does look great though
[0:02:58] <Arrior_Septem> very crisp
[0:02:59] <DracaenaLeaf> I like it for now, idk
[0:03:00] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpGood 720p
[0:03:04] <+cvp5127> kinda choppy
[0:03:06] <mankeyfigh> CRISP
[0:03:08] <%Binary_Fireball> it looks nice
[0:03:14] <@Solidus_113> you could try for 900p
[0:03:17] <NeroInfinite> cwisp
[0:03:18] <+Ryu_R> as long as the VODs on youtube are 1080 that seems fine?
[0:03:20] <Futurecity10> holy shit thats crisp as fuck
[0:03:23] <kuningaz45> Audio is still crunchy like nestle
[0:03:26] <+MrAtheGreat> Camera fps seems fine to me.
[0:03:27] <dapperskeleton69> cwispy
[0:03:34] <+steelmorrigan> yeah in movment but yes alittle choppy, I've seen worse
[0:03:35] <NeroInfinite> I can see thepores
[0:03:39] <%Prevot> camera looks really nice, but moves like a shitty webcam
[0:03:40] <$burgersama_dlx> i dont know nothin about streaming but can you switch it to less high quality when the cam on you guys is smaller?
[0:03:41] <MojoKingIzakku> yeah you can see the hairs in woolie's dreads
[0:03:42] <soycristian31> its not horribel
[0:03:42] <+MrAtheGreat> Audio is fine to me
[0:03:51] <%Binary_Fireball> elgato makes me sad
[0:04:03] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @MrAtheGreat Game audio is choppy, not mic audio.
[0:04:07] <dapperskeleton69> you can see the individual eyebrows
[0:04:12] <CrimsonCore90> 6 hours?
[0:04:13] <TigerClaws12> it's low but that's to be expected when they don't have a compressor?
[0:04:21] <MojoKingIzakku> @TitaniumDragoonNeo they just fixxed the game tho
[0:04:27] <$burgersama_dlx> its better than it was
[0:04:28] <%CJett92> Video being just mildly choppy aint that bad, the audio fix was the big one
[0:04:31] <@Solidus_113> Could ask Pat or Max for some tips if needed
[0:04:40] <CrimsonCore90> Open the Game!
[0:04:44] <+MrAtheGreat> @titaniumdragoonneo yeah, but now it’s fine.
[0:04:48] <%Solidnick18> for now it's fine
[0:04:51] <MojoKingIzakku> probably camera dependent
[0:04:55] <Aussie_Manny> WII DO IT
[0:04:56] <WG101> CLEAN AUDIO

[0:05:04] <+steelmorrigan> so clean
[0:05:05] <kuningaz45> CWEAN
[0:05:06] <+Javaa01> Max probably has a lot more experience overall with high end cam gear and getting it to not crap the bed constantly
[0:05:07] <Asuxley> fixed
[0:05:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE FIGURED IT OUT

[0:05:45] <TigerClaws12> @Solidus_113 they need a compressor bad, always have to bump this stream's tab with an extension because it's low relative to others :(
[0:05:47] <dapperskeleton69> i can see the individual hairs on everyones balls!
[0:05:53] <DaKnightWarrior> Let the saltfest begin HahaLean
