[0:02:10] <akman14> Like sweets in a closet
[0:02:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Secret consumption.

[0:02:24] <+UberWolfman> Society ruins everything Kappa
[0:02:27] <xxshadowxx416> so Asami eat chocolate
[0:02:30] <DatAsuna> But gimme a full size game
[0:02:33] <%Malik1002> I fill that there is a rush to it watching something secret
[0:02:34] <+ggbhtg> Social acceptance?
[0:02:35] <+Lizard0TM> validation
[0:02:35] <%gatorafan> While I understand what's being said, I'm honestly shocked at how people keep doing the same thing over and over.
[0:02:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is the worst
[0:02:45] <available_line> Woolie is secretly watching HxH you heard it here first.
[0:02:45] <%correctedsun117> Like false validation
[0:03:19] <%Ashenik1> But dont watch Korra though
[0:03:26] <DatAsuna> It's echoes
[0:03:41] <+Lavrohas> Without john? sacrilige, we need that gon in 60 seconds content pristine
[0:04:00] <lotharrio> It's a huge waste of time.
[0:04:06] <DatAsuna> You have actually used homestuck memes without knowing
[0:04:09] <Ravingpyro> do not bring up the Forbidden Webcomic
[0:04:11] <memejima> BOY That's a bag of worms, not a can, a whole bag
[0:04:12] <+Lavrohas> read it but dont even touch the fandom lol

[0:04:28] <Halospaz117> I am completely neutral on Homestuck
[0:04:28] <%andrex2311> Homestuck is ok
[0:04:30] <Ravingpyro> i lost years of my life to Homestuck
[0:04:33] <DasFreekman> @woolieversus just ask octo about it
[0:04:33] <muniea3> homestuck suck (probably, I haven't read it)
[0:04:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Never watched it, don't know what it is. Is it a cartoon?
[0:04:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> I have no strong feelings one way or the other!
[0:04:40] <%afronooch> Homestuck is okay.
[0:04:41] <$Invlux> nobody likes Homestuck, most of all people who like Homestuck
[0:04:45] <+oda_flobunaga> Homestuck is just Homestar Runner right?

[0:06:05] <DatAsuna> I love the episode of breaking bad where sephiroth teams up with Elsa
[0:06:06] <+ChronoaZ> i read SBaHJ before homestuck and didnt know they were connected at all
[0:06:10] <@Menitta> I use one called UnDistracted

[0:06:49] <huskarl_zap> narks
[0:06:56] <TheVerySeriousLewis> I can't play Persona 5. I own it, wish I didn't though.
[0:06:57] <@Menitta> the Woolie Versus fanbase ruined Woolie for me.
[0:06:57] <+ggbhtg> Toxic _____ Community, which is EVERY community sooner or later
[0:07:00] <SereneFox> Yeah, like I enjoyed Kingdom Hearts 3, but seeing SO MANY people whine and complain about it made me stop and think "Wait, did I really enjoy the game?" same thing with Pokemon Sword and Shield
[0:07:11] <Doodle_Taco> Hey everyone KonCha
[0:07:11] <muniea3> fanbases are emblematic of the content, though
[0:07:13] <Roboticist> Yoooooo, first time catching the SWTOR stream life. I miss any gameplay or is this just the pregame?
[0:07:16] <huskarl_zap> toxic is a fake ass word
[0:07:19] <%WanderingSwordsman> *cough* Undertale*cough*
[0:07:29] <huskarl_zap> double speak
[0:07:29] <%correctedsun117> Jesus stans damaging the fandom
[0:07:30] <Ravingpyro> sadly, V, the nasty people tend to be the loudest
[0:07:34] <Mayachacha> @Irridium I was the same, until last year, when I finally decided to give it a shot, and it was great.

[0:08:30] <+Lizard0TM> Linkin Park is a pretty good example
[0:08:38] <%Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus what if Reggie liked the ending of Game of Thrones?

[0:08:39] <%jiggy_snipe> exactly
[0:08:48] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Woolie, speaking of Eminem, people use the term Stan in unironic fashion. We've fallen that far.
[0:08:49] <%DashXero> Sometimes, things are objectively bad, though.
[0:08:51] <muniea3> Music is the most emotionally invested in by nature
[0:08:59] <%Chatterbox1991> "Crucify Him" said Cleveland about Lebron
[0:09:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> There are some rap songs I LOVE but I'm not a fan of rap
[0:09:07] <+ChronoaZ> Viper is good
[0:09:11] <%Camail> we just like using the words good and bad waaaay too much
[0:09:13] <%andrex2311> just say "Fuck off asshole" to toxic fan and ignore them. SeemsGood
[0:09:18] <@Menitta> that is so ironic.
[0:09:18] <+ggbhtg> MY TASTE IS CORRECT nuuuuu
[0:09:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Trapped in the Closet is the Shit
[0:09:24] <+ggbhtg> reeee
[0:09:30] <%Chatterbox1991> i was that person for a while
[0:09:31] <%jiggy_snipe> this is getting a little deep

[0:09:58] <Doodle_Taco> Cognitive dissonance nooooooo
[0:10:05] <lotharrio> Some... BODY once told me the world is gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
[0:10:06] <huskarl_zap> There is no bad. consume poison.
[0:10:06] <%JohnAtDawn> The fuck is wrong with liking Sum 41?
[0:10:10] <IIChampagne> what's poppin butter milk Jesus
[0:10:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> its like the people that feel the need to shit on snyder cut people. I didn't care about the snyder cut but i don't lose anything from them getting it Like whatever don't be a dick about it.
[0:10:22] <Mayachacha> someone tweet this to Pat
[0:10:25] <+ggbhtg> it's ok to not like things
[0:10:29] <a_mad_dragon> be excellent to each other
[0:10:31] <%jiggy_snipe> NO V you can't like what I don't LIKE
[0:10:32] <%andrex2311> what? fake? LUL
[0:10:35] <+oda_flobunaga> Waifu Wars are the worst
[0:10:36] <%optimasmaximas> that person sounds dumb
[0:10:36] <+ggbhtg> it's ok, but don't be a dick about it
[0:10:38] <%Chatterbox1991> ! T O X I C !
[0:10:39] <%eyezehuhh> I think they mean cringe
[0:10:47] <muniea3> it's vague on purpose
[0:10:48] <huskarl_zap> But there is no bad so nothing can be toxic.
[0:10:53] <therat_giant> @huskarl_zap way to miss the point. reviewers exist to determine their own opinion of things and you read their review to gauge what your own might be
[0:10:54] <Hopit> I find your dislike of the word toxic, toxic Kappa
[0:10:58] <%krispen_wa> Toxic is a REALLY STRONG pokemon attack
[0:11:04] <%Irridium> you know when you get the Toxic ailment in Dark Souls? it feels like that but in real life
[0:11:06] <+oda_flobunaga> Mac Vs PC
[0:11:07] <%Camail> anti-social behaviors
[0:11:10] <%Ashenik1> The thing you like and I dont is objectively bad, plus your white
[0:11:12] <%eyezehuhh> everything is cringe. like what you like
[0:11:13] <%OldManDeckardCain> toxic is pretty overused nowadays tbf
[0:11:17] <Mayachacha> Toxic was a Britney Spears song
[0:11:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> Overwatch people that want to ban you for using a skin they don't like
[0:11:35] <stayinthepocket> Of course also the people that want to throw around "you're being toxic" when something is really just a valid criticism.
[0:11:39] <+ggbhtg> but don't be a dick about the things you don't like
[0:11:42] <%GoldeNOVA> cringe toxic Kappa
[0:11:43] <%eyezehuhh> @doc_ock_rokc is that a thing? that's incredible
[0:11:47] <the__empire_strikes__ass> Vous êtes très talentueux, tout ce que vous faites est génial melparTy Grand succès! SeemsGood Boi-oi-oing!
[0:11:54] <%andrex2311> Toxic is the best Pokemon move tbh
[0:11:57] <%Camail> toxic is a meme as well as a useful word, depending on who you talk to
[0:11:58] <%Chatterbox1991> Was the P5 Fandum really that bad?
[0:12:05] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus but what if it ends up being terrible ?
[0:12:09] <@Menitta> Toxic is a real good pokemon move.
[0:12:11] <Doodle_Taco> @chatterbox1991 It has its parts
[0:12:12] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak!
[0:12:15] <+Ancopro> i don't care the ultimate power move
[0:12:21] <muniea3> just use icky pooie, it's more classic
[0:12:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> @eyezehuhh before the entire hong kong thing I was using the police skin and some asshats told me to remove it or they'll report me
[0:12:35] <%jiggy_snipe> was it Reggie?
[0:12:43] <%Chatterbox1991> Really? Woolie likes Jojo?
[0:12:47] <%Chatterbox1991> i hadnt noticed
[0:12:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> @eyezehuhh I screenshot the interaction and sent it in and thankfully i didn't get into trouble
[0:13:06] <+ggbhtg> Sounds like FGC ers
[0:13:07] <%Lion_kun> Part 1
[0:13:08] <%Ashenik1> witcher 3 kappa
[0:13:09] <@Menitta> That doesn't work
[0:13:11] <+ggbhtg> that I know
[0:13:12] <%jiggy_snipe> that is interesting
[0:13:13] <+treynrek> what are they talkin about
[0:13:14] <lotharrio> I don't understand that.
[0:13:14] <+wunp_fxs> weird
[0:13:15] <megamirk> nice legs, sith lord
[0:13:21] <+Ancopro> i think thats fair, i dont think you NEED to start at part 1
[0:13:29] <%mitchteck> Yyyyyyyyyyyy
[0:13:30] <%andrex2311> start with chapter 1, page 1
[0:13:36] <+Feralspirit41> I have become sheeple
[0:13:43] <%Lion_kun> Bandwagon jumping
[0:13:44] <%jiggy_snipe> Sheeple Kappa
[0:13:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's OOF, but to be fair I saw the All Might Vs Noumu fight without context to lure me in.
[0:13:49] <ralphfromdk> Those people are called followers :D
[0:13:49] <stayinthepocket> "Hey where start with thing?" The beginning is usually a good place to start.
[0:13:50] <%andrex2311> LUL
[0:13:55] <lotharrio> Cultivated consumption?
[0:13:57] <%barkon345> the issue is becasue of how long anime can get
[0:14:00] <%Camail> that's not entirely what this person is doing tho, they ultimately decide if they like it and continue watching
[0:14:10] <%jiggy_snipe> reverse hipster
[0:14:11] <$Invlux> performative enjoyment
[0:14:13] <Doodle_Taco> I want to be "based"
[0:14:18] <lotharrio> I can get that for One Piece. Cause that's how I got my friends to like it.
[0:14:18] <%Irridium> looking for validation
[0:14:18] <+ggbhtg> Will I fall out of my clique for liking this thing?
[0:14:28] <%andrex2311> so Game of Thrones?
[0:14:29] <%krispen_wa> SECONDARIES
[0:14:38] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> gandalfsmagicgaydick subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:14:42] <%gatorafan> I've started watching Sajam's streams? What did I think about it? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:14:43] <@Menitta> Solving that problem with FOMO is more rewarding than liking the thing
[0:14:51] <%spacehouse> I just like not wasting my time with awful media
[0:14:52] <@Menitta> In that case
[0:14:53] <stayinthepocket> The hell is fomo?
[0:14:54] <%barkon345> when you here about a cool part but realize you have to watch 300 episode to get to that part and find out the context of it, it might not seem worth it to watch the whole thing
[0:14:55] <Hopit> Anime was/is the biggest thing of that here, in my teenage years, if you openly said you watch anime, you were considered to be a freak and basically shunned
[0:14:59] <%Lion_kun> How many people only watched End Game?
[0:15:00] <%afronooch> Fear Of Missing Out
[0:15:01] <@Menitta> "Fear of Missing Out"
[0:15:10] <+ggbhtg> It aint a good look
[0:15:10] <stayinthepocket> ty ty
[0:15:14] <+Kyma1020> Sounds like a poser
[0:15:15] <%andrex2311> FOMO = Fear of Missing Out
[0:15:21] <%jiggy_snipe> sounds like a need for validation
[0:15:23] <@Menitta> Personally I've stopped taking recommendations.

[0:25:09] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 Wooliem if you want to talk about weird and baffling religious practices endorsed Christianity, there one aspect to the Church of Latter Day Saints that i am shocked no one ever talks about; in addition to the traditions of Jesus Coming to America and other less printable beliefs, one of the more esoteric facets of the Mormon Church is there ability to, somehow, convert dead people to Mormonism, makes one wonder why they have evangelical ads on Youtube at all.

[1:17:18] <+Stupid121v2> Darth Nadds
[1:17:21] <derap41> Darth Woolz?
[1:17:22] <penitentpentwitch> Don't Jedi 'technically' allow breeding as long as there are no emotions for the offspring?

[1:17:52] <+ItsRatman> Darthington
[1:17:52] <%krispen_wa> Marka Ragnos was sick as fuck and didn't have a Darth in his name tho
[1:17:54] <lotharrio> Had sex. Bad at his job.
[1:17:56] <DatAsuna> He was a sith though, he studied from naga sadow and killed him
[1:17:58] <Sedrelic> so...satan
[1:18:07] <%Atomik456> i mean if you go crazy and evil enough as a jedi that you just go right to murdering and ignoring history you'd skip the sithy and darth part
[1:18:17] <%krispen_wa> Actually when was the "Darth" title instituted? Because the ancient Sith Lords didn't have "Darth"
[1:18:21] <blackskulldragon18> Darth Narshida would sound cool
[1:18:22] <+jake5713> so wrong
[1:18:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Sith that are bad at they’re job die off pretty quick

[1:18:52] <%Atomik456> cant be a darth if you kill sith for shits and giggles
[1:18:53] <Halospaz117> The Genocide was just a bonus
[1:18:54] <JaceIsEpic> isnt nadd the dude who controlled stars?
[1:18:59] <Manjove> Genocide was just a bonus
[1:19:01] <dinnydanny777> If the Sith are evil is eradicating them good?
[1:19:02] <SiegeJay> Are you really a Sith if Mira kills you?
[1:19:04] <lotharrio> "From Freedon's perspective, Woolie is a stupid name!"
[1:19:12] <ralphfromdk> But hey, the king, he lived long enough to take over a planet and have offspring. Most jedi / sith just die never having done anything of worth ever.
[1:19:26] <+Feralspirit41> Basically the empires mentality "we genocided this group while doing this evil shit"

[1:19:53] <lotharrio> "Combat Enhancement Rapid Shot"
[1:19:56] <%Atomik456> yeah i feel like the implication here is he kinda just went right off and ignored the sith and just decided to be a evil force user on his oown terms
[1:20:07] <SiegeJay> Remember the old Gendy Clone War Cartoon when Dooku told Atris, "If you were Sith, this fight would be over already"
[1:20:14] <gerakiv> Rey is technically a princess, she just needs an empire to rule Kappa

[1:38:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @feralspirit41 Once you get super good at math, it basically becomes a form of True Sight. If you have it, you love it.
[1:38:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you're not in engineering/programming probably not.
[1:38:42] <audibleellipsis> @dinnydanny777 trick question, you never said how many people were on it in the first place
[1:38:44] <%Redblood801> I wish Remote would play those sick beats
[1:38:44] <%Chatterbox1991> How many of us ran into that one Matg Puzzles in the Bank Vault in P5?
[1:38:44] <%Irridium> trains big and go woo woo
[1:38:46] <gerakiv> That would depend on how many passangers were on the train before 7:15am
[1:38:49] <muniea3> V lookin at the wave forms and getting off on it
[1:38:51] <%Chatterbox1991> And couldnt do it?
[1:38:52] <Doodle_Taco> @subjectg nice
[1:38:53] <JetpackMcQuack> Guitars are surprisingly math heavy
[1:38:56] <akman14> What about when the whole world turns into stone and you are awaken into a stone world?
[1:39:00] <DatAsuna> Math was the worst part of computer sicence for me
[1:39:05] <+cmdrmobium> You need math to get the big number
[1:39:05] <dinnydanny777> Really though screw those rambling maths questions where the question is more confusing than the actual maths is
[1:39:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> What the fuck is "Math 30 Pure?"
[1:39:08] <%ChoculaUltra> you guys don't have to find the hypotenuse in everyday life???
[1:39:09] <%Ashenik1> algebra Kreygasm
[1:39:09] <MattHughh> “We know our players are wondering what’s next for Street Fighter V, so we have some exciting news to share,” reads the developer blog. “Due to the positive reception to Season 4 and Champion Edition, we are planning to do a final Season ‘V,’ which will add ‘V’ more fighters to the roster. Three new stages are also being planned.”
[1:39:11] <DatAsuna> I actually was okay at LEARNING math but terrible at retaining it
[1:39:16] <cobalt_phoenix_> also hello to future me who will be watching this later
[1:39:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not what it is, but that name.
[1:39:25] <MattHughh> pretty hype
[1:39:31] <T_Sasquatch> As an engineering undergraduate fuck math until its time for math
[1:39:32] <treacherously_> He got to where math stops being fun for most
[1:39:49] <+Feralspirit41> Math stopped being fun at algebra
[1:40:01] <%chll0ne> @feralspirit41 on god
[1:40:01] <SiegeJay> Is the V in LittleVMills is for Vectors? because math? PogChamps
[1:40:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> @MattHughh So are you saying we are getting V?
[1:40:09] <+Feralspirit41> Although most of that was cause my teacher didnt actually teach anything
[1:40:16] <T_Sasquatch> Math is only fun when you're getting it right
[1:40:19] <treacherously_> I entered uni engineering left neuro cus fuck physics too
[1:40:21] <DSD24> Crit Defensive Blade souds awesome
[1:40:22] <DatAsuna> gdi stream is lagging tf out
[1:40:23] <MattHughh> math stopped being fun at what we started not needing in everyday life
[1:40:23] <+Feralspirit41> she gave us worksheets and said "do this" without actually showing us how to do it
[1:40:32] <MattHughh> @doc_ock_rokc sounds like it rihgt?
[1:40:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:40:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @feralspirit41 But that's when math starts to reveal the metaphysical truths of existence.
[1:40:37] <%Irridium> I'll be real I dropped right the fuck off math when we started talking about imaginary numbers
[1:40:37] <DSD24> That sounds terrible @Feralspirit41
[1:40:41] <SiegeJay> Math is fun when the methods make sense for you
[1:40:41] <treacherously_> Calculus is kinda fun if you have infinite time to practice it
[1:40:53] <JetpackMcQuack> Math gang gameattackWutang
[1:40:57] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @feralspirit41 you're literally describing my geometry teacher from high school lol
[1:40:59] <+Feralspirit41> @generalscpatton if i wanted to learn about the truth of existence id have gone into philosophy
[1:41:05] <T_Sasquatch> Ironically the level of math required for living a normal life is really surprisingly low
[1:41:07] <DSD24> Fractions is the real shit
[1:41:18] <Doodle_Taco> @feralspirit41 Why are most math teachers like this?
[1:41:19] <audibleellipsis> match stopped being fun at calculus, where things stop making sense and you just have to remember laws without any kinda obvious logic.
[1:41:21] <%chll0ne> fractions fun
[1:41:26] <+grim_alex95> I never understood algebra because every teacher I had was unable to teach it atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:41:26] <sagemodeanon> Ive honestly never used math after highschool besides MDAS and rarely percentages
[1:41:33] <cobalt_phoenix_> math was always fun for me but since it never gets used irl i forgot most of it :(
[1:41:33] <treacherously_> Applied math stuff is good
[1:41:34] <DatAsuna> I liked trigonometry I just could never remember it
[1:41:41] <subjectg> ever considered how to apply integration by parts in normal living situations
[1:41:46] <treacherously_> I use a lot of graphs at work in lab
[1:41:47] <liriallirial> sup people
[1:41:51] <+Feralspirit41> ironically my best math is statistics
[1:41:55] <cobalt_phoenix_> socatoa
[1:41:57] <DSD24> Hiya! @liriallirial
[1:41:59] <dinnydanny777> Maths is fun to prove a point tho
[1:42:09] <JetpackMcQuack> Math makes you better at video games
[1:42:09] <+Feralspirit41> i was good at binomials
[1:42:17] <+MillerLowlife> math sucks eat my shorts
[1:42:18] <audibleellipsis> fuck proofs
[1:42:19] <%MattDemers> I gotta admire the dedication of V always wearing his robes
[1:42:20] <DSD24> I liked PEMDAS
[1:42:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> I got up to discreet mathmatics and then couldnt' get it
[1:42:25] <dinnydanny777> Can we get "force catch a star destroyer"?
[1:42:28] <Manjove> SUCH A BIG FORCE
[1:42:38] <megamirk> Mace Windu was untouchable too
[1:42:43] <DatAsuna> btw for vias, finese melee does affect sabers and her high dex makes it useful
[1:42:44] <megamirk> until he wasn't
[1:42:45] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @dinnydanny777 you can if youte starkiller lol
[1:42:52] <cobalt_phoenix_> do you guys think jedi were taught physics?
[1:43:16] <DSD24> People got so hype at that first trailer with Starkiller bringing down the destroyer
[1:43:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @CobaltPhoenix27 some jedi repair hyperdrives I think they know more about physics then we do
[1:43:50] <+CezrDaPleazr> How you liking the game?
[1:43:55] <dinnydanny777> Wow
[1:44:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DSD24 It was pretty damn cool
[1:44:03] <DatAsuna> maybe turn the gameup to hard if you haven't lol
[1:44:04] <+Feralspirit41> you know if real math actually let me loot ancient evil tombs id be more inclined to do it
[1:44:06] <abelincoln_catpuncher> oof
[1:44:07] <cobalt_phoenix_> wait now that i think about it couldn't force users just crush people's brain with the force or something? that has to have been done at some point right?
[1:44:09] <%Redblood801> Did we ever change the difficulty back to normal?
