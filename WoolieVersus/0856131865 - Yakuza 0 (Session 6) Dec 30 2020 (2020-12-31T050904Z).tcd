[0:01:22] <Ciriliko> No spoilerinos please, i didnt watch it
[0:01:23] <blue6sub6remnant6> Like Cowboy Bebop?

[0:01:38] <Darren716> Pls no spoils
[0:01:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Didn't watch it yet
[0:01:44] <akman14> I CLAPED
[0:01:44] <huskarl_zap> the 8 minutes of actual plot
[0:01:47] <+Bailey__gaming> had like 1 bad episode
[0:01:47] <PrideOfFiddles> Better than season 1?
[0:01:52] <%BisoromiBear> @andre11dr the manga super is
[0:01:53] <SomersaultJustice> when that thing happened, I felt stuff about it
[0:01:57] <gigamaid> I was afk in Yakuza 0 and Mr shakedown walked into me, rip
[0:02:07] <%ChoculaUltra> I actually have a few friends who have never watched any of the Star Wars flicks but loved both seasons of Mando so far.
[0:02:09] <%Javaa01> @gigamaid Oof
[0:02:10] <AngryAsian5> Yeah, that shit was solid
[0:02:13] <%gatorafan> MONEY ON!
[0:02:13] <+Bailey__gaming> BIG money
[0:02:14] <andre11dr> @bisoromibear yea, i only know the anime
[0:02:19] <+TheBigMak> As far as I know, this is the first Star Wars production where Harrison Ford didn't let the craft services spread get cold.
[0:02:22] <%ZweihanderSteve> lol i watched the OT for the first time this year just to watch mando LUL
[0:02:26] <+Bailey__gaming> I like the references to things!
[0:02:27] <MyNameIsRasus> After GOT I will watch it only after it ends
[0:02:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Those space chase scenes are rad
[0:02:38] <+JustToWatch> @LVL1_Scumbag I did not expect to see someone else mention Lexx today
[0:02:43] <emeraldskrull> SOMEHOW mandolorian has returned
[0:02:46] <%BlueJoneleth> Mandalorian is an RPG campaign
[0:02:50] <@Solidus_113> "we gotta be a taxi service"
[0:02:59] <%BlueJoneleth> Do adventure, get loot
[0:03:09] <FuumetsuKuroi> Meesa back?

[0:03:23] <gigamaid> mr shakedown kicked my ass, now he has about a billion yen
[0:03:24] <andre11dr> So Star Wars Outlaw Star ,ok I'll watch this
[0:03:25] <+Omegaanimus> the scale of production is smaller, but uses more complex technology than standard productions.
[0:03:26] <%ZweihanderSteve> nice, sounds like galaxy express 999
[0:03:34] <weatherrapport> t
[0:03:38] <gameshark45> Mando is definitely disguising it's power level.
[0:03:38] <%Feralspirit41> "Oh no we landed on the planet of infinite hitlers"
[0:03:43] <+Omegaanimus> Mandalorian uses Unreal engine iirc
[0:03:49] <iswearimjustdandy> These uncultured swine in chat who dont know what lone wolf and cub it smdh
[0:03:52] <blue6sub6remnant6> @akman14 Kids these days don't know about murder Samurai and his kid in the baby carriage made of spears.
[0:03:52] <%FiniteMonster> +1 light side points
[0:04:07] <%Reverend_Roscoe> There's literally a mission from KOTOR 1 in the Mandalorian

[0:06:02] <kenny_biff> it will go that way. they always do
[0:06:05] <andre11dr> "We can do it"
[0:06:09] <%BlueJoneleth> well they announced tons of new TV shows
[0:06:10] <+Tucker0603> just bring EU back
[0:06:11] <+Bailey__gaming> it can retcon the bad films
[0:06:12] <NaturalGear> ! DISNEY!
[0:06:26] <%BlueJoneleth> I mean we got like 3 spin offs already
[0:06:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> that's rad
[0:06:28] <%NopeBadguy> What are they talking about? Mando?
[0:06:32] <andre11dr> As Plague would say "MMMMMMM MEEEEEEE"
[0:06:33] <Lieutenant_America> I have faith in Filoni and Favreau to pull it off whatever direction it goes.
[0:06:42] <+lugraylucid> @NopeBadguy yeah
[0:07:06] <%NopeBadguy> I've always heard Rebels was bad?
[0:07:07] <@Commando_Joe> Resistance is much more 'for kids'
[0:07:23] <brunoberserk> they announced 10 new series
[0:07:28] <xanerts> for clone wars you really need a viewing guide I think
[0:07:30] <%BisoromiBear> They give a shit, but not about making interesting Star Wars content.
[0:07:31] <Halospaz117> Rebels is still good, i think it's just generally agreed that clone wars is better
[0:07:31] <+JustToWatch> @NopeBadguy rebels started bad but got better
[0:07:33] <%BlueJoneleth> I mean, Mark Hamill doesn't like the sequels.
[0:07:36] <gameshark45> Starwars the Hutt demands it gets talked about more in their small-time story
[0:07:39] <%BlueJoneleth> So you know they fucked up
[0:07:40] <PrideOfFiddles> I hope we get more helicopter lightsabers
[0:07:44] <Lancaster_H> @NopeBadguy it's not bad but it's much more kid friendly than the Clone Wars show
[0:07:50] <@Solidus_113> The movies may have more company meddling in it, because they're the most "official"
[0:08:01] <%FiniteMonster> Rebels starts off a bit kiddy, same as Clone Wars. but it gets real good especially after the time skip
[0:08:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1343849215710142464?s=19
[0:08:07] <%eyezehuhh> @PrideOfFiddles FUCK I forgot about that

[0:08:22] <Lieutenant_America> You mean Filoni?

[0:08:40] <Darren716> Shit

[0:10:34] <grouchio> Does Punch mom simp for Bill Burr?
[0:10:42] <turbofolk> Shes not tho
[0:10:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ROSARIO DAWSON MF
[0:10:47] <Lieutenant_America> She's at the end of her character arc
[0:10:56] <%eyezehuhh> "Jedi"
[0:11:03] <Nekros4442> Yeah, she's at the very end of the character arc
[0:11:04] <Lieutenant_America> That said, you literally missed all of her arc
[0:11:17] <grouchio> T
[0:11:20] <%DatAsuna> She's still boring but yeah there's missing context
[0:11:21] <%NopeBadguy> Thrawn is more of a Rebels arc than a Clone Wars arc
[0:11:31] <turbofolk> Technically she is not a jedi, they did not give her certificate
[0:11:45] <Lieutenant_America> She grows up
[0:11:46] <grouchio> Thrawn, or what Disney should've started with to begin with
[0:12:00] <%eyezehuhh> Not enough credits on her Jedi college course
[0:12:04] <%DatAsuna> Also the show ruins bariss offee for that terrible arc
[0:12:16] <brunoberserk> NOT MY PROBLEM ANYMORE
[0:12:16] <%NopeBadguy> In a sense, she's kinda like how Qui Gonn was
[0:12:26] <%DatAsuna> Yeah that's a big waste of tython
[0:12:31] <+Tucker0603> yeah the Tython shit was kinda bullshit
[0:12:31] <%ChoculaUltra> wouldn't mind an absolutely batshit take on the whole Yuuzhan Vong war tbh
[0:12:47] <%wibbwobbler> this all works if 7 8 9 just doesn't happen
[0:12:56] <%DatAsuna> Also going to tython, like through space is meant to be super dangerous
[0:12:57] <%Feralspirit41> It was cool that they acknowledged tython though
[0:12:57] <grouchio> Mauler did NOT like episode 6
[0:13:00] <Lieutenant_America> she's doing her own thing
[0:13:12] <%DatAsuna> The deep core is meant to be full of dangerous space shit, so no travel time was disappointing
[0:13:14] <%Feralspirit41> Not what they did there but that they at least acknowledged that it existed
[0:13:17] <%ChoculaUltra> lol literally anything in Star Wars would've worked till Disney said "rip EU"
[0:13:55] <+Tucker0603> SO FUCKING CRAPPY DROIDS
[0:13:56] <%DatAsuna> That's every time canon namedrops something
[0:13:58] <AngryAsian5> Man, I got so hype for them too LUL
[0:14:01] <halfmasks> pain
[0:14:08] <%NopeBadguy> To be fair, HK would be very out of place in the Wild West mood
[0:14:15] <grouchio> They ain't wrong
[0:14:20] <%DatAsuna> they don't speak period
[0:14:30] <%BisoromiBear> Speaking of Kotor holes, I wonder if those guys are still falling.
[0:14:32] <%NopeBadguy> Bubba Fett
[0:14:36] <%DatAsuna> that episode wasn't wild west
[0:14:40] <akman14> I CLAPED FOR BOBA FATT
[0:14:42] <gameshark45> BOBA FETT IS LITERALLY THE HYPEST SHIT
[0:14:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @gameshark45
[0:14:46] <Lieutenant_America> probably
[0:14:47] <turbofolk> he survived
[0:14:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> AND HE'S ALL FUCKED UP
[0:14:50] <Jonny_Uppercut> I love Temura Morrison as Boba too ayaSHY
[0:14:51] <%BestTeaMaker> mulan and boba fett together at last
[0:14:54] <%DatAsuna> Their own thing
[0:14:56] <@Solidus_113> More like bubba fat. He's real wide in that outfit
[0:15:01] <+Sendrak70> lol now that the twisted tea meme is in full force, all I get are adds for twisted tea.
[0:15:02] <8bitdana> WorfPls
[0:15:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:15:06] <+Tucker0603> he's got some fucked up scars
[0:15:09] <%DatAsuna> Every time someone comes back the answer is never that the legends story is canon
[0:15:15] <%DatAsuna> even if the new story is similar
[0:15:19] <+DGenerator> boba shaming D:
[0:15:21] <%nevermorecake> Temeura was busy getting thick while singing kiwi country
[0:15:24] <%nevermorecake> Be nice
[0:15:25] <brunoberserk> chunli and boba feet being cool
[0:15:26] <%NopeBadguy> Also, does Mando Season 2 confirm Jango was part of Death Watch since Mandalore proper denied Jango was a mando in Clone Wars?
[0:15:27] <Lieutenant_America> He's just a simple man
[0:15:28] <andre11dr> Ok ,now i understand why Woolie keeps saying Star Wars TM ,they throw a bunch of " look the thing, clap"
[0:15:40] <Lieutenant_America> Do remember he knows the pain of losing his father
[0:15:42] <emeraldskrull> boba fett is the roman reigns of star wars
[0:15:43] <%BlueJoneleth> Lawful Evil?
[0:15:47] <8bitdana> NO honor
[0:15:48] <turbofolk> Hes a mercenary, mandalorians are mercenarys
[0:15:49] <%ChoculaUltra> "we said/showed the thing, now clap!"

[0:15:59] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Jango was not born mandalorian, he was inducted
[0:16:09] <Lieutenant_America> Bo-Katan is a prick
[0:16:20] <emeraldskrull> bo katan, the well known terrorist
[0:16:21] <%DatAsuna> bo katan is a terrorist basically
[0:16:24] <@Commando_Joe> He's not 'fuck the code', his father was honored by Mandalore so he respects it...sort of...but he doesn't put up with political bullshit @WoolieVersus
[0:16:25] <+yusefHD> did anyone talk about how the Mandalorian is essentially a monster of the week anime
[0:16:25] <%jinking79> pay me
[0:16:26] <%aram909> little V where is the tux?
[0:16:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> NOT ANYMORE SHE AIN'T
[0:16:27] <%nevermorecake> Woolie watching Clone Wars when

[0:16:51] <%Livelinne> indiea3BathroomGlock indiea3Pog Yakuzzis... in space?
[0:16:59] <MAX116030> Yeah thats one is weird
[0:17:00] <%ATRodger> ATRodger subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 7
[0:17:00] <Lieutenant_America> I think there's something going on there
[0:17:01] <%DatAsuna> retcons abound
[0:17:04] <@Commando_Joe> There was probably a bunch of old traditionalists that told her she was a fake leader
[0:17:05] <Diablo169> Yeah but the point is, they didn't respect her because she didnt earn it
[0:17:10] <Lieutenant_America> I doubt Filoni forgot
[0:17:13] <AngryAsian5> I'm assuming they'll probably fill that gap
[0:17:14] <akman14> NO HONOR
[0:17:15] <+Ether101_Prime> The thing is Bo is a massive traitor.
[0:17:21] <turbofolk> THE WAY THO
[0:17:26] <@Solidus_113> part of the crazy group
[0:17:29] <%wibbwobbler> this is the way :(
[0:17:33] <+Tucker0603> it is nice that he's part of a fanatically group
[0:17:37] <brunoberserk> NO HONOR *jetpacks away*
[0:17:40] <Diablo169> She wanted to earn it properly this time, and Mando beat her to it
[0:17:41] <Lieutenant_America> Like Tyler Durden?
[0:17:44] <grouchio> FOR MANDALOOOOORE
[0:17:45] <%BlueJoneleth> This is the Way

[0:18:53] <Diablo169> No
[0:18:53] <%kyh9> "DIE ON THE ALTER FOR SNOKE BULLSHIT"
[0:18:57] <+Tucker0603> HE CAN'T BE JUSTIFIED!!!
[0:18:59] <AngryAsian5> M-count bitches LUL
[0:19:00] <gameshark45> that's the point of the bodies in those lab tanks
[0:19:00] <grouchio> NO ONE'S EVER REALLY GONE
[0:19:03] <%aram909> oh justify palpatine's existence in episode 9?
[0:19:06] <therealtacopancakes> noooo :(
[0:19:06] <%DatAsuna> also one of those shows is using the time travel iconography
[0:19:06] <+shootbang_exe> either that or justify the snoke pickle jar
[0:19:08] <%kyh9> "USE YOUR CLOUT TO JUSTIFY RISE OF THE SKYWALKER"
[0:19:08] <%Feralspirit41> Fuck i really hope they dont do that
[0:19:09] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> NOOOOO
[0:19:11] <Lieutenant_America> Filoni made the Prequels work
[0:19:19] <brunoberserk> NOOOOOOOOOO
[0:19:25] <+Ether101_Prime> They're planing to retcon it all with the Asoka show.
[0:19:34] <%aram909> im just going to ignore episode 9 ever happened
[0:19:35] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Is Starguments just a fixer-upper?
[0:19:36] <MAX116030> Yeah thats one is obvious. But wasnt that obvious from the beginning?
[0:19:39] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:19:52] <%BlueJoneleth> Well theyr're making a Luke Spinoff so who knows lol
[0:19:52] <andre11dr> They should probably just dodge everything from the new movies, but they won't, because Disney will force them
[0:19:55] <%wibbwobbler> at least they might actually commit to something
[0:19:56] <+MajorCrasher> are they discussing every episode? damn
[0:20:00] <%robo_trunk> Why can't they just recast Luke?
[0:20:00] <heartlesshealer> Can't one thing just not be about Palpatine? >:
[0:20:09] <AngryAsian5> Esposito went ham during that fight scene
[0:20:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I really wanted Sebastien Stan as Luke
[0:20:16] <+Tucker0603> FUUCK PALPATINE
[0:20:18] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> I mean there is like 10 new Star Wars shows coming
[0:20:20] <+yusefHD> I want to see a cameo of finn I don't give a shit
[0:20:22] <gameshark45> Space Gus, Gust to Gust
[0:20:25] <+tigerfang86> Yes
[0:20:27] <+eanscrale> It's the Neo-Zeta thing
[0:20:30] <Lieutenant_America> I mean, SHOULDN'T they set it up more?
[0:20:32] <+Tucker0603> his bullshit in aE.u
[0:20:34] <%ChoculaUltra> nah, John Boyega wants NOTHING to do with SW now
[0:20:34] <%eyezehuhh> Star Wars is just about ONE person
[0:20:35] <+tigerfang86> yeah but the sequels are REALY egrigious
[0:20:36] <andre11dr> Also i didn't knew that this was between 6 and 7 ,i thought it was like pre 1
[0:20:42] <%ChoculaUltra> but a Finn cameo as a trooper or kid would be neat
[0:20:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus The house of Star Wars is a fixer-upper
[0:21:01] <+tigerfang86> BUT HES SO COOLTHO
[0:21:04] <Lieutenant_America> Hey if it's good, it's good
[0:21:06] <+tigerfang86> hes COOL THO
[0:21:10] <@Commando_Joe> If it's good, it's good
[0:21:11] <%wibbwobbler> so many tho
[0:21:12] <%Grimlockfly> @tigerfang86 BUT HES COOLTHO
[0:21:13] <@Commando_Joe> If it's bad, it's bad
[0:21:19] <@Commando_Joe> let it happen and see what happens
[0:21:25] <%BestTeaMaker> i want to believe it'll be good cause it'll star mulan
[0:21:25] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:21:28] <%osaka_daioh> Good call Woolie XD
[0:21:29] <%BisoromiBear> oh yeah, those happened
[0:21:30] <%BlueJoneleth> They're basically making SW version of MCU
[0:21:30] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Yeyeyeye
[0:21:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:21:36] <%BestTeaMaker> i want mulan and boba fett to be an awesome duo please
[0:21:36] <andre11dr> Boba Fett is kinda of a loser tho
[0:21:41] <%DatAsuna> I do, but not canon boba
[0:21:43] <%ChoculaUltra> I heard the dude who played Daredevil on the Netflix show got signed onto Spider-Man 3
[0:21:47] <%kyh9> BOBA FETT WAS NEVER THAT IMPORTANT THOUGH
[0:21:48] <%AbsoluteUppercut> But at least Daredevil Season 3 is really good
[0:21:48] <hkgamingtv> I can't watch CSB anymore, too many Hot Takes
[0:21:54] <Lieutenant_America> Ye of little faith
[0:21:56] <%kyh9> BOBA FETT WAS JUST SOME JACKASS THEY HIRED
[0:21:58] <+tigerfang86> who needs importance HE'S COOL THO
[0:22:00] <+tigerfang86> BUT HES COOL
[0:22:04] <@Commando_Joe> @andre11dr so was Anakin, but look what clone wars did
[0:22:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:07] <Diablo169> If they tell a good story and make his character interesting it's fine?
[0:22:09] <wruce__billis> @hkgamingtv Rare is totally overrated tho
[0:22:13] <%DatAsuna> If clone wars has to be canon a boba fett show needs heavy retcons
[0:22:15] <+jiggy_snipe> over saturation is a thing studios, ip owners need to learn about
[0:22:25] <MAX116030> They can make Boba Fett series more about black market and criminal world since Boba is the head
[0:22:31] <%kyh9> Filoni is good
[0:22:32] <8bitdana> it's a little concerning how they're milking it so much though :(
[0:22:40] <grouchio> Reminder: Disney now has multiple Murdoch failsons directing/producing MCU/SW films
[0:22:42] <@Solidus_113> Anakin is still a loser, he's just now a well written loser
[0:22:47] <%DatAsuna> Filoni also wrote a lot of bad filler
[0:22:47] <%ChoculaUltra> call me crazy - they could even throw Dash Rendarr into the Boba Fett show. I'm JUST sayin.
[0:22:48] <%kyh9> WHY DID IT NEED TO BE THE GUY WE KNOW
[0:22:51] <%kyh9> WHY COULDNT IT BE A NEW GUY
[0:22:53] <%NopeBadguy> Also does that mean Grogu dies to Ben Solo?
[0:22:55] <akman14> What was worse , Harkin or Luke CGI?
[0:22:58] <Lieutenant_America> I just think it's neat
[0:22:58] <OldManDeckardCain> the rest of rogue one was meh tho
[0:23:00] <+tigerfang86> CAUSE ITS COOLLLLL
[0:23:03] <%DatAsuna> And a lot of good episodes Filoni didn't write got credited to him by fans who don't read credits
[0:23:04] <%kyh9> Let's go focus on Mandalore
[0:23:05] <@Commando_Joe> @kyh9 because too many characters make shit dumb
[0:23:05] <cosmov06> Should of been Kyle!!!!
[0:23:10] <Diablo169> We got to see Luke in his prime kick some ass. I don't care
[0:23:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Tarkin was worse
[0:23:17] <MAX116030> I dont know it did make sense for it to be Luke
[0:23:17] <+yusefHD> Boba fettuccine Collab w East side Mario's when
[0:23:18] <cosmov06> Kyle Katan!
[0:23:20] <+tigerfang86> Luke doing real jedi master shit is great
[0:23:20] <+Ether101_Prime> They're planing on retconing the sequels.
[0:23:22] <%eyezehuhh> It also bookends Grogu
[0:23:29] <+BachOClock> Luke Xwing Machina
[0:23:30] <@Solidus_113> Why couldn't it be Kyle Katarn
[0:23:31] <grouchio> @Ether101_Prime Source?
[0:23:31] <turbofolk> Deep fake are awful give new young actors
[0:23:33] <Lieutenant_America> It gave us something the goddamn sequels never did
[0:23:33] <Louie_Salmon> @commando_joe But then you just never link to the main thing. So there aren't too many.
[0:23:35] <turbofolk> a chance
[0:23:42] <%ChoculaUltra> they could easily go out and say 7-9 was a "what if" situation but they prob won't.
[0:23:43] <+memequisition> luke showed up in his tight pants bc he wanted to meet mr mando
[0:23:46] <%kyh9> @Commando_Joe True, but then don't have a jedi show up at all
[0:23:46] <@Commando_Joe> @Louie_Salmon But people like the main thing
[0:23:46] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus Luke shoulda been Sebastien Stan
[0:23:48] <Lieutenant_America> Also everyone just shut up about Kyle Katarn
[0:23:50] <Saltmeisterr> yall talking bout Glup Shitto?
[0:23:51] <%eyezehuhh> Why wasn't he Sebastian Stan tho?
[0:23:51] <@Commando_Joe> I literally saw people crying for Luke
[0:23:52] <heartlesshealer> the trope is "Big Damn Heroes"
[0:24:01] <@Commando_Joe> Woolie and James are not average fans
[0:24:02] <%NopeBadguy> Heads up, Dark Troopers are a Dark Forces reference
[0:24:03] <+BachOClock> Grogu is short for Grogury
[0:24:03] <agustorm123> It was like hey a jedi can do what you did but in like 5 seconds LUL
[0:24:04] <Louie_Salmon> @commando_joe No, they think they do, but they hate star wars.
[0:24:07] <%wibbwobbler> mando vs tie fighter was cool
[0:24:07] <+OmegaWeltall> Baby Yoda and his chickey nuggies
[0:24:11] <%kyh9> LETS SEE THE MANDALORIAN CONTEST
[0:24:12] <%DatAsuna> Also it's the luke who decided to change nothing about jedi, unlike legends luke
[0:24:12] <+DGenerator> stop deadnaming Grogu
[0:24:15] <+lizard_the_wiz> @eyezehuhh hes probably stuck filming shit for marvel
[0:24:20] <+BachOClock> i started calling him Space Greg
[0:24:27] <brunoberserk> i intestered in the kenobi show , just because ewan mc gregor and the possible memes
[0:24:30] <%eyezehuhh> @eyezehuhh Damn you Disney
[0:24:31] <@Commando_Joe> @Louie_Salmon I dunno man, people crying and saying 'I love Luke' was a thing
[0:24:34] <+Ether101_Prime> @grouchio All the people leaking shit form the Lucasfilm?
[0:24:36] <%Afterman_> mando is 5 years after rots
[0:24:46] <%Afterman_> baby yoda was born around TPM
[0:24:55] <+vaderxyz1970> Yaddle
[0:24:55] <MAX116030> It did work well to make Jedi special. Like 1 dark trooper was a terminator but Jedi went though whole platoon like nothing. I like it for that aspect
[0:24:55] <@Commando_Joe> Also Luke saving everyone was what people were pissed didn't happen in the movies @WoolieVersus So the director gave them what the movie didn't
[0:25:04] <%Afterman_> rotj* not rots*
[0:25:14] <grouchio> ***Lucasfilm Leaks indicate that the Sequels are getting Retconned***
[0:25:21] <%Afterman_> plus there was yaddle, so at least 2 at a time
[0:25:23] <%robo_trunk> Baby Yoda's was Palpatine's first attempt at making Anakin confirmed.
[0:25:24] <+DGenerator> *poop*
[0:25:29] <%wibbwobbler> he is older than luke
[0:25:43] <+Idziman> long five minutes lol
[0:25:43] <%DatAsuna> The problem with canon luke is that he doesn't do anything different with the new order where he makes all of the rules
[0:25:46] <%Asuterisuku> I've been out of SW since TLJ.
[0:25:48] <$Invlux> oh good we back
[0:25:50] <agustorm123> A jedi can do what like 4 mandalorian can and better that’s what we get in that last minute luke part
[0:25:53] <Lieutenant_America> No faith in the man carrying the franchise since 2008
[0:26:03] <@Menitta> Code Vein is alright
[0:26:08] <%Reverend_Roscoe> did Code Vein end up being good?
[0:26:09] <andre11dr> If only Star Wars wasn't owned by EA what could be
[0:26:10] <OblivionSword1> I like code vein
[0:26:12] <gameshark45> Joe Mama
[0:26:13] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Code vein is cool
[0:26:15] <%DatAsuna> Code Vein is decent
[0:26:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I played some but it kinda fell flat for me
[0:26:20] <Louie_Salmon> I wish it was less anime
[0:26:21] <@Menitta> Its just fine really
[0:26:23] <ayexp4254> i played the demo for 5 min and said nope
[0:26:23] <@Commando_Joe> @Lieutenant_America outside of some of the games, yeah. Some of the games were great without his help
[0:26:25] <hkgamingtv> Can't wait for Scarlett Nexus
[0:26:25] <+vaderxyz1970> Hot spring for somereason
[0:26:29] <%Razputin217> Anime Souls is pretty good
[0:26:30] <Saltmeisterr> the character creator is good
[0:26:32] <%zanzibar_junker> Nioh 2 has kung fu
[0:26:32] <+jiggy_snipe> we need more blank Souls
[0:26:36] <@Menitta> Scarlett Nexus looks fire
[0:26:39] <%ChoculaUltra> did EA renew their deal with Disney for Star Wars video game rights?
[0:26:40] <%Terrarp> Code Vein or The Surge?
[0:26:41] <Zayasu> is that the jo mama game?
[0:26:41] <%Javaa01> @Reverend_Roscoe Ironic considering the character designs
[0:26:43] <%DatAsuna> God eater remains their best thing
[0:26:43] <grouchio> Heard Code Vein's gameplay was bad
[0:26:49] <%DatAsuna> we'll see how scarlet nexus is
[0:27:00] <halfmasks> @grouchio I felt it lacked heft or weight
[0:27:02] <heartlesshealer> code vein's gameplay is just not for everyone
[0:27:06] <%zanzibar_junker> Code Vein is easy
[0:27:07] <%illtima> DLCs are not good, you didn't miss on much V
[0:27:08] <@Solidus_113> Iron Pineapple
[0:27:09] <@Menitta> Scarlett Nexus doesnt look anything like Code Vein though so It'll probably be good
[0:27:09] <%Feralspirit41> theres always chinese knock offs
[0:27:10] <%enZymeth> Iron pineapple
[0:27:11] <+jiggy_snipe> oh yea
[0:27:11] <+JustToWatch> Nioh is just samurai souls
[0:27:13] <Louie_Salmon> Japan doesn't really like 3rd person things, right?
[0:27:13] <huskarl_zap> iron pineapple
[0:27:13] <+Ether101_Prime> @grouchio More over, WDT(?) Pro a known and proven Disney Insider talked about it.
[0:27:16] <+jiggy_snipe> all of those steam games
[0:27:16] <gameshark45> iron pineapple
[0:27:17] <%ChoculaUltra> cuz I'd love to see the Star Wars ip in different hands all around. Like a Old Republic character action game by like Platinum or some insane shit
[0:27:17] <andre11dr> Uhhhh Nioh
[0:27:18] <notsoy> yoooooooooo
[0:27:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WE GOT ELDEN RING NEWS TODAY
[0:27:24] <%wanderingdain90> code view gameplay is poo poo and lacks any real impact
[0:27:28] <MyNameIsRasus> I liked that game's solution to the "why not run to the boss" problem Souls have
[0:27:30] <%Terrarp> Nioh is my go to for Japanese souls
[0:27:30] <heartlesshealer> I only dropped off because the environment got super uninteresting at the government building
[0:27:33] <@Menitta> Surge 2 is awesome
[0:27:35] <%DatAsuna> @JustToWatch nah Nioh has plenty of Diablo and NinjaGaiden in it too
[0:27:41] <Louie_Salmon> That's why all their 3rd person games control the camera with buttons, they don't play them often over there
[0:27:45] <%zanzibar_junker> Nioh is like Raidou now
[0:27:46] <exnuart> iron pineapple
[0:27:57] <%DatAsuna> Endgame Nioh gearing is fantastic
[0:27:58] <grouchio> !! ELDEN RING CONCEPT ART !!

[0:43:58] <grouchio> GORO-CHAAAAAAN :D
[0:44:01] <heartlesshealer> Goro-chan <3
[0:44:02] <Solidnick18> ehhhh
[0:44:02] <+Koover> hmmm...Kiryu-chan
[0:44:04] <%BisoromiBear> Fine. I locked eyes with you, so I am honor bound to follow through with this ridiculous set of circumstances.
[0:44:07] <brachydios777> Japan is weird
[0:44:10] <AngryAsian5> KIRYU CHAN
[0:44:15] <WG101> a thought forms in his head
[0:44:18] <+DGenerator> when she puts on your sweater
[0:44:20] <+MrAtheGreat> And thus Majima was inspired
[0:44:20] <Lancaster_H> sasuga Madden-kun
[0:44:27] <%X2Eliah> .... closest thing.. like.. "Honey"?
[0:44:30] <Halospaz117> The vocal dick grab
[0:44:31] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> pet names?
[0:44:31] <%wibbwobbler> nick name
[0:44:37] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, it would be slightly weird if a total stranger said your first name, I guess
[0:44:40] <xUrbanCarnage> Military?
[0:44:40] <+MrAtheGreat> KIRRRRYUUUU-CHAN
[0:44:41] <%wanderingdain90> calling someone you barely know "babe"
[0:44:42] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> madden-kun... dame...
[0:44:49] <%X2Eliah> Woolie dearest
[0:44:49] <%Klefth> It's like referromg to someone by "tu" in spanish in certain regions
[0:44:49] <laguerrilha> Yeah a lot of asian countries calling the first name of physical touch is is too personal
[0:44:54] <%Klefth> referring even
[0:44:54] <%DatAsuna> but also the japanese have no personal space
[0:44:55] <Halospaz117> Business-like
[0:44:56] <8bitdana> finnish is a little bit the same, it's fascinating
[0:44:57] <+jiggy_snipe> yea pet names are a thing here kinda
[0:44:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> Even Kansai?
[0:44:59] <heartlesshealer> english doesn't have that aside from appending cutesy nickname that takes up the end of the person's name
[0:45:02] <Lancaster_H> and german is as literal as possible
[0:45:10] <%DatAsuna> so physically they will be right up in your face but not saying your first name
[0:45:12] <akman14> Ranked relationships
[0:45:12] <xUrbanCarnage> Military address each other by last name
[0:45:28] <%Seancicle> TPFufun
[0:45:37] <%X2Eliah> You know, Majima is really on the straight-and-narrow for a crazed ex-yakuza.

[1:12:23] <exnuart> HEAT
[1:12:23] <8bitdana> perfect time for heat moves
[1:12:24] <%gnarly_memes_bro> shakedown is better late game grinding for kiryu but you need to feed him money to multiply it
[1:12:24] <tsunderecactus0> We can use heat moves PogChamp
[1:12:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> not really just an enemy that hits hard
[1:12:32] <Kohei_kyouji> @metabot64 mini boss who roams the streets and he gives tonnes of cash

[1:12:55] <%aram909> god this was the worst shakedown fight yet
[1:12:56] <Crowmanhunter> No heat run!!!
[1:12:57] <+DzyZ_> ez

[1:13:00] <8bitdana> @Mr_Pylon FeelsBadMan
[1:13:03] <brachydios777> YOU DID IT
[1:13:04] <xUrbanCarnage> I went in the store, bought a beer, and Woolie is still fighting shakedown Kappa
[1:13:05] <357Sneak> lytFIRSTTRY 1st try
[1:13:06] <shadowcrisis> Eh Woolie beat Japanese Gun Jack
[1:13:10] <RyuuAoi> Money money money money! Money!
[1:13:18] <%gnarly_memes_bro> guys that would require woolie being ok with chugging tauriner's for heat, which is the same as dmc items
[1:13:26] <$BallerSwagBro9k> there's 4 SHAKEDOWNs
[1:13:26] <+Ether101_Prime> Aren't some of the skill make having full bars of heat increase strength and speed.
[1:13:26] <KeiPrime> lodsemone
[1:13:27] <%aram909> yeah but this isnt dmc
[1:13:27] <%gatorafan> Make Chat Heat Moves a channel points thing
[1:13:29] <hkgamingtv> He'll figure it out eventually I hope
[1:13:33] <DSD24> My fight moneyyyyy
[1:13:37] <%Spydurman> @WoolieVersus Slugger heat move knocks down a Shakedown giving you free hits. Can be super useful. Also using heat moves gives you way more money from him
[1:13:38] <Kohei_kyouji> yes @Ether101_Prime
[1:13:44] <exnuart> i thought there was 3 shakedowns for each
[1:13:48] <ALIN135> Whats rong with dmc items? Kappa
[1:13:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 2 for each
[1:14:01] <%GarouFGC> God damn it, WOOLIE, Use the Slugger Style Heat move against Shakedown. Its Free.
[1:14:01] <Kohei_kyouji> ^
[1:14:04] <flame_of_udun_> This is NOT DMC lol
[1:14:06] <+Ether101_Prime> @Kohei_kyouji That's what I thought.
[1:14:10] <%gnarly_memes_bro> for some people, nothing. but thats not woolie
[1:14:20] <RyuuAoi> The girth is real
[1:14:20] <WG101> EGASHIRA EVERYWHERE
[1:14:22] <tubit> Egashira Kreygasm
[1:14:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Instant transmission!
[1:14:26] <%Spydurman> ^^ Slugger Heat Move vs Shakedown is super strong
[1:14:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> APEX PREDATOR
[1:14:29] <brunoberserk> just making him akuma
[1:14:31] <%X2Eliah> true
[1:14:34] <%doomerskeletor13> APEX PREDATOR
[1:14:38] <%aram909> woolie, the slugger style has heat moves you can pull on shakedowns without needing to knock them down and it takes out like 1/4-1/5 of their health bar each time, its free real-estate
[1:14:42] <hkgamingtv> HEAT MOVES!?
[1:14:42] <PanicSwytch> This Substory is so wholesome
[1:14:49] <exnuart> stock tauriner and spam heat
[1:14:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Egashira is easily the best Shakedown.
[1:14:52] <SomersaultJustice> did the bullet train exist back then?
[1:14:53] <%CaptCynical> HEAT MOVES? NEVER HEARD OF EM
[1:14:57] <flame_of_udun_> Doesn’t he know about slugger heat moves by now?
[1:14:59] <shadowcrisis> I gotta 99 side stories but a stitch aint one ....also you just whooped Japanese Gun Jack
[1:15:01] <RyuuAoi> S links!
[1:15:04] <thetrashman_sc> good sub story
[1:15:05] <alvaroeltz> do you guys think woolie will try "that" fight?
[1:15:06] <hkgamingtv> get those toys
[1:15:07] <Prevot> I dunno about friendship with little girls...
[1:15:07] <+Ether101_Prime> But heat moves have demintioning returns.
[1:15:13] <%gnarly_memes_bro> woolie will not pause and use items for resources, thats just how he is. he's only going to do it to heal
[1:15:14] <Spoofy16> bullet train in the 80s...
[1:15:18] <plushysceptile> So beating Shakedown without getting hit gives a big bonus to money earned and finishing him with a heat move is another bonus

[1:15:38] <+canseesea> She doesn't have nearly enough cigarettes to be in a japanese arcade in the 80s
[1:15:39] <%Spydurman> @Ether101_Prime it also knocks Shakedown down and gives you free heavy hits, super good
[1:15:43] <+talkingrain3139> Did Woolie send any scouts to get weapons for the weapon shop?
[1:15:52] <tubit> Your pockets are too small for arcade games little girl
[1:15:54] <RyuuAoi> Woolie knows arcades ain't for kids.

[1:52:09] <+bearwagon> They were being manipulated by Madara this whole time, and Majima beat the mind control out of them
[1:52:10] <WG101> @penitentpendant customer is king, and majima's the french revolution
[1:52:15] <R3c0n31> Never killed no one
[1:52:20] <%gatorafan> this franchise be like that some times
[1:52:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[1:52:40] <hkgamingtv> That's why the franchise is beloved
[1:52:40] <ZComiX> they really missed an opprotunity when majima would probably be the most likely to kill someone
[1:52:43] <%gnarly_memes_bro> thats a fair criticism
[1:52:48] <%jinking79> this happens in all the Games
[1:52:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YAKUZA IS A WHOLESOME CRIME DRAMA
[1:52:49] <+SeedTabulous> the only maps they need are the maps to the nearest prison
[1:52:51] <velgaduere> yeah they deserve it, but Majima isn't fully aware of the actual evil tho
[1:52:52] <SunsetJack> Dood, can't they just buy their freedom lol

[1:53:10] <$Invlux> Majima will do BIG MURDERS
[1:53:12] <%jetjagger222> oh boy that one other sidestory...

[1:53:17] <%Afterman_> majima would rip their asshole apart literally with his bare hands
[1:53:18] <RyuuAoi> Majima should murder
[1:53:20] <%wibbwobbler> the fact that they get away should be tragic or something
[1:53:27] <Qsmash_> Majima is a civilian right now though
[1:53:30] <velgaduere> @DSD24 did Majima hear that? I don't remember if that was at the tail end or not

[2:06:45] <%ggbhtg> V Special into Special Cancelled, EX Style Kappa
[2:06:51] <hkgamingtv> this thing sucked
[2:06:57] <%doomerskeletor13> This becomes pretty trivial when you have a bunch of money
[2:06:58] <%Aldesso> do this boring thing to worsen your experience
[2:07:00] <velgaduere> @somedude1013 it's like multiplying by a negative... it just switches polarity every time it happens. he's currently uncanceled
[2:07:01] <+talkingrain3139> This is how you get weapons for Kiryu
[2:07:02] <turbofolk> look at these mid-00 photos of japan just think its the 80's tho
[2:07:06] <agustorm123> is it necesary to 100% tho
[2:07:08] <TheHoodedTeddy13> I want to play a character in a TTRPG once who is a big burly fighter, who him speak like hulk, but he is actually very intelligent and english isn't his first language
[2:07:14] <$Superdandy96> It’s very “oh neat”
[2:07:17] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Its worth spending a bit of time to unlock some good weapons and gear but totally not necessary
[2:07:21] <flame_of_udun_> You really don’t have to do this
[2:07:23] <PanicSwytch> U will need to do this later to get a rare sword for a substory
[2:07:24] <President_valentine> you can just ignore this
[2:07:32] <%jetjagger222> @TheHoodedTeddy13 you mean like the heavy from team fortress 2?
[2:07:33] <tubit> Money sink
[2:07:36] <@Menitta> this is pretty ignorable
[2:07:40] <%Aldesso> never in this game will it be necessary to equip a weapon
[2:07:42] <notsoy> you do need to futz with this for 100% completion
[2:07:44] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @velgaduere i say cancel the cancelers. ... jokes are fine. the new people wantto be moral crusaders.
[2:07:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:08:02] <R3c0n31> yea this is super ignroable till end game area time
[2:08:24] <turbofolk> You are just reading the words as they are, sure you are V sure you are
[2:08:31] <WG101> oh it was long hua expedition, my bad
[2:08:36] <notsoy> you don't even need it for end-game either - the stuff you get from sub-stories and bob will be more than enough
[2:08:40] <%gnarly_memes_bro> he dropped a couple of words but I don't think he even realizes it

[2:12:50] <majindusto> US WACKY CANADIANS
[2:12:56] <majima666> we still use miles here in the uk. its kinda like a mish mash of metric and imperial
[2:12:58] <superslacker> @WoolieVersus The game will let you know when he's back,just go do stuff
[2:13:00] <President_valentine> Remember pagers
[2:13:09] <TheHoodedTeddy13> I remember I made my dad feel so old when I first played this, I had to ask him what a pager was and how it worked
[2:13:14] <velgaduere> pager codes are weird
[2:13:14] <R3c0n31> Pager Talk?
[2:13:19] <Exodusprime1256> pagers are fucking cool
[2:13:19] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @WoolieVersus yeah reading numbers.

[2:13:20] <+Grayhammatter> what...
[2:13:21] <@akuda_bar> pager codes

[2:13:21] <OblivionSword1> japanese pager code maybe
[2:13:23] <Prevot> who the fuck knows
[2:13:23] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> pager codes
[2:13:27] <notsoy> read the numbers out loud in japanese
[2:13:28] <hkgamingtv> don't drive 170kph, it's pretty easy to get caught
[2:13:32] <alyss988> Japanese number code
[2:13:35] <TheHoodedTeddy13> Usually people set up codes with eachother beforehand
[2:13:36] <dukenux> theres a whole subgenre of japanese puns based around numbers @WoolieVersus
[2:13:38] <Exodusprime1256> it's like texting morse code
[2:13:41] <TheVoltStrike> yeah i imagine the initial of the numbers
[2:13:43] <+FuqBoiSlim> I'm too zoomer to know what a pager is
[2:13:45] <TheVoltStrike> one after the other

[2:14:36] <+talkingrain3139> Keep doing it to get the zap gun
[2:14:39] <+SeedTabulous> I know we're off the topic but I think the fastest I've been in was around 225kmh cause I rode in a stock car during some county fair
[2:14:39] <+kewlmyc> Craft weapons
[2:14:50] <+b_aleph> get tonfas!
[2:14:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:14:52] <alvaroeltz> crafting is just itens but not costing money
[2:14:54] <Kohei_kyouji> @WoolieVersus dispatch is how you get all the best stuff
[2:14:55] <tubit> I like the kabuki art on that screen in the back
[2:14:56] <%Javaa01> Craft weapons to do big damage heat moves on Shakedown
[2:15:04] <+FuqBoiSlim> I only know what a pager is cuz of that one king of the hill episode where Peggy starts hanging out with a hooker
[2:15:04] <%Javaa01> That's pretty much the point
[2:15:06] <coreyyotto> Grind through like a hundred garbage weapons in order to get one or two good weapons that let you cheese fights
[2:15:12] <dukenux> It's the same thing
[2:15:19] <andre11dr> To Nunchuks and totally not kill people with them
[2:15:23] <dukenux> Just go to a hardware store
[2:15:30] <masterfire23> black flag ship mini game
[2:15:42] <%gnarly_memes_bro> It took me all of 20 minutes to get a zap gun, people are overexaggerating how long it takes to get good gear
[2:15:45] <+Mendin> Fei Hu going semi-local is raiding shops, yeah, but going further could hit up ancient ruins etc
[2:15:47] <@Solidus_113> take a train to Hakone for crafting materials
[2:15:53] <%Javaa01> @andre11dr Especially since it literally plays a melon crushing sound on the heat move, so definitely not killing anyone

[2:21:25] <mister___doctor> Icy cold tale
[2:21:26] <fIashman92> Can't do heat move?

[2:21:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:21:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Kung fu, meet BAT
[2:21:52] <dukenux> FUCK YOU OLD MEN
[2:22:03] <+b_aleph> tonf
[2:22:07] <Darren716> Thank you V for trying to speed this along
[2:22:10] <dukenux> can you polejump
[2:22:10] <+Grayhammatter> POLE
[2:22:13] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> TONFA?
[2:22:17] <+Grayhammatter> tonfa?
[2:22:20] <%gnarly_memes_bro> crowbar is "tonfa" @woolieversus
[2:22:21] <fIashman92> Crowbars are tonfas fyi
[2:22:27] <%FiniteMonster> KAPOW
[2:22:27] <MyNameIsRasus> GONNA NEED A MONTAGEE
[2:22:29] <Exodusprime1256> training montage
[2:22:32] <exnuart> after fights gives weapon lore
[2:22:32] <$Superdandy96> Imagine how quick Kung fu movies would end if someone just brought a bat?
[2:22:33] <TheHoodedTeddy13> MONTAGE!!
[2:22:37] <DSD24> We doing Talim combos now!
[2:22:40] <+Mendin> HYPE DOG?
[2:22:45] <jamesthebrave> Montaaaaaaaaaage~!
[2:22:48] <hkgamingtv> thankfully this trainer is pretty straightforward
[2:22:52] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> the weapon history is cool tho
[2:22:55] <Solidnick18> SourPls SourPls
[2:23:06] <$Superdandy96> You know, that’s a good point. Crow bar Tonfa.
[2:23:08] <DSD24> Yay we get to listen to more good music
[2:23:11] <Dhurkst> bruh, way to skip cool stuff
[2:23:12] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> and he has one tonfa... because it's more portable... and fei hu is a bad ass
[2:23:12] <Darren716> Woolie there's nothing really interesting in training, you can skip past dialouge
[2:23:12] <+Mendin> That's a good combo he did, there
[2:23:13] <+Stupid121v2> This song also has slight Gintama vibes lol
[2:23:15] <+MugenSandan> no V if the LP isn't slow how will I complain about Woolie on reddit
[2:23:16] <+SeedTabulous> On the topic of soundtracks I think my favorite is 0 or 5, 5 mostly because of how much of a banger Shinada's theme is.
[2:23:19] <exnuart> b to break guard
[2:23:43] <WG101> it's cool, though
[2:23:44] <%gnarly_memes_bro> its so great tho
[2:23:45] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s a guard break, it’s also part of the Essence of Slugger heat move
[2:23:45] <Blank9> Destiny from 6 is an incredible song.
[2:23:47] <+Mendin> Just pour that muted trumpet jam into my VEINS
[2:23:50] <%X2Eliah> Crowbar style looks cool
[2:23:55] <%shadowsofpain> I personally loved learning about the weapons but I also was playing by myself with out having to worry about streaming
[2:24:02] <R3c0n31> i like how the Tonfa is actually going through your block
[2:24:02] <SunsetJack> Trumpet really brings it
[2:24:03] <+SeedTabulous> @Blank9 6's soundtrack is just depressing (in a good way)
[2:24:03] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> boss but BIG
[2:24:11] <Dhurkst> @darren716 weapon history is cool, so that's wrong. Bacchus also has great dialog
[2:24:11] <TheHoodedTeddy13> I feel like Shinada from five would want to kick Majima's ass for using a baseball bat in a fight
[2:24:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> NARUHODO
[2:24:13] <Qsmash_> Song sounds like Silver Thrust from Megas XLR
[2:24:13] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> oh man, i just realized that woolie hasn't gotten the third majima style yet. Im hyped for that
[2:24:15] <+TheAmazingNick> Japan's fascination with Baseball is weird
[2:24:17] <penitentpendant> Good use of Super Armor
[2:24:24] <spikyhyena> Recieve and Slash You is a pretty banger track
[2:24:29] <hkgamingtv> Do Baseball
[2:24:31] <exnuart> i finished kiwami 2 today, cant wait for 3-6 on steam
[2:24:34] <stormhawk9891> @SeedTabulous Yo Battle for the Dream and Collision of Our Souls are fucking bangers
[2:24:37] <+Mendin> @The_EasilyBoredGamer Remember when he saw Majima's first style was Thug, and he joked, "When's Hustle and Flow?"
[2:24:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Japan loves baseball so much that one of the games just completely revolves around it
[2:24:40] <flame_of_udun_> Receive You is always good
[2:24:42] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> boss... but BIG... big boss... OOOOOOOH.
[2:24:47] <TheHoodedTeddy13> @TheAmazingNick spoken like someone who isn't a baseball fan
[2:24:47] <R3c0n31> Technique is better then money, it grows your strength
[2:24:51] <majima666> @TheAmazingNick i think it has something to do with post ww2, or so i was told
[2:24:52] <+bearwagon> they give you cool heat moves
[2:24:54] <TheHoodedTeddy13> Baseball is awesome
[2:25:00] <TheHoodedTeddy13> go Cubs!
[2:25:02] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> @Mendin nah, only seen the videos uploaded so far, and this stream
[2:25:04] <Solidnick18> kalik sticks
[2:25:05] <+Idziman> the kali sticks are dope
[2:25:07] <Josef_Stryker> Yeah Kali!
[2:25:10] <AngryAsian5> Yeah Kali!
[2:25:13] <$Superdandy96> Each weapon also has unique heat moves
[2:25:15] <%gnarly_memes_bro> IDK Japan and baseball seems like a perfect fit for me, its a sport that involves a lot of suspense and deliberate stances
[2:25:15] <exnuart> escrima
[2:25:19] <DSD24> In terms of Yakuza music like Fly in Yakuza 3
[2:25:22] <+Mendin> @The_EasilyBoredGamer Well, I mean, the third style is pretty flow
[2:25:24] <Dhurkst> @darren716 stuff also goes down with rush training, too.
[2:25:25] <penitentpendant> The power of California Sticks!
[2:25:27] <%Javaa01> Yeah all weapon types have their unique heat moves
[2:25:28] <+Mendin> So his joke resonated with the Universe
[2:25:33] <Gates623> Kali sticks hurt
[2:25:33] <%thesickestzak> Kali sticks like Steve Blackman
[2:25:35] <Josef_Stryker> Also called Escrima or Arnis
[2:25:37] <TheHoodedTeddy13> Like, as a baseball fan myself, Shinada's part in 5 was a *treat*
[2:25:37] <redrins> escrima
[2:25:43] <redrins> les go
[2:25:44] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I can easily imagine old school samurai playing baseball
[2:25:47] <majindusto> TAIKO DRUM TIME!!!
[2:25:50] <Darren716> Still time is better spent on sub stories or main stuff
[2:25:50] <hkgamingtv> unbreakable Kali sticks were my go to
[2:25:52] <%Irridium> hacksaw jim
[2:25:54] <WG101> DON DON
[2:26:05] <+tigerfang86> the QUICK DUAL WIELD
[2:26:05] <8bitdana> @TheHoodedTeddy13 it was very fun :D shinada is very lovable, too!
[2:26:06] <DSD24> Fei Hu has cool combos
[2:26:08] <dukenux> oh i like these
[2:26:14] <%Javaa01> Yeah can't heal during the lightgun segment
[2:26:19] <Josef_Stryker> One of the reasons I love Nightwing is that he usually uses Kali sticks
[2:26:19] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> and that it's a big staff. two smalelr sticks more portable. more versitle
[2:26:21] <%gnarly_memes_bro> kali sticks are fuckin rad
[2:26:22] <%Javaa01> Otherwise you're good
[2:26:29] <+Mendin> That's some big dex dualwield
[2:26:36] <exnuart> no heat during these fights
[2:26:52] <%doomerskeletor13> These fights won’t let you do heat moves
[2:26:55] <+Mendin> He prefaced by saying "This is training, so let's not use our strongest moves"
[2:26:56] <jacksonomar> Cant use hear now
[2:26:56] <%gnarly_memes_bro> all the fun of bonk with all the style of dual wielding
[2:27:00] <+Mendin> == no Heat
[2:27:03] <exnuart> he says no heat allowed
[2:27:05] <Dhurkst> kinda weirded out that they haven't skipped any dialog in this playthrough up to now, but now they're skipping everything here. wtf?
[2:27:10] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> these games are weird about whether or not people can see heat auras
[2:27:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Xu Xiaodong
[2:27:19] <+Lazy_Vagabond> the weapons have a high 3 bar heat move and a lower 1/2 bar heat move
[2:27:19] <%doomerskeletor13> @dhurkst They just want the moves
[2:27:21] <+Stupid121v2> no heat moves here because american history X'ing your sensei would be rude
[2:27:24] <8bitdana> @Dhurkst it's almost the same everytime
[2:27:24] <jacksonomar> Cant use heat now*
[2:27:28] <penitentpendant> Homerun!
[2:27:28] <+Mendin> That synth jam reminds me of some Emerson Lake and Palmer if they got funky
[2:27:29] <@Solidus_113> big swing
[2:27:30] <Darren716> Dhurkst V knows this stuff isn't as interesting for the text
[2:27:34] <exnuart> skipping dialog here cause outside weapon facts theres not much here
[2:27:38] <TheHoodedTeddy13> Shame Shinada kinda fell off the face of the earth though after 5. Didn't even show up in the baseball management minigame in 6!
[2:27:40] <DSD24> Taishi Ci in Dynasty Warriors had cool stick moves
[2:27:53] <+MugenSandan> I do hope that in Y8, Ichiban gets Majima as a Bat tutor or something because his Bat in Y7 doesn't get enough cool moves
[2:27:58] <+Mendin> I want to pour this soundtrack through Alex Moukala's ears and see what he comes up with
[2:28:03] <President_valentine> Shinada is wack so I'm fine with him not returning
[2:28:05] <8bitdana> @TheHoodedTeddy13 true FeelsBadMan still hoping they bring him back in some later game
[2:28:09] <velgaduere> @Dhurkst it's just going through the motions, he already knows it's minimally interesting
[2:28:09] <+Grayhammatter> nunchaku PogChamp
[2:28:14] <AhmCha> poles=keepout, kali=rushdown
[2:28:18] <%Javaa01> Nunchuks are the big murder heat move weapons
[2:28:19] <hkgamingtv> Grind it out woolz
[2:28:29] <majindusto> AH, A FELLOW CHUCKER EH?
[2:28:34] <+tigerfang86> He's a chuckster
[2:28:34] <8bitdana> @Mendin has he not listened to the yakuzie osts??
[2:28:39] <+Mendin> I don't know
[2:28:39] <DasFreekman> I'll be sad if akiyama doesnt come back
[2:28:40] <exnuart> nunchuks are the muder now and murder your future children
[2:28:45] <%gnarly_memes_bro> CHUCKSTERS RISE UP
[2:28:47] <@Solidus_113> stick on chain
[2:28:48] <dukenux> do nuchucks come from a japan?
[2:28:51] <Dhurkst> @doomerskeletor13 they paid attention to other trainer dialog, and this even has cool historical info they're skipping. it's honestly obnoxious.
[2:28:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1343849215710142464?s=19
[2:28:52] <DSD24> Maxi combos
[2:28:57] <Nekros4442> guys talk about Yakuza 0...stop being stupid
[2:29:01] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s so tragic that this theme only appears here
[2:29:10] <+Mendin> stop being stupid? This is a Yakuza game friend
[2:29:13] <%X2Eliah> Nunchuks, more like "hit yourself in the groin sticks"
[2:29:15] <8bitdana> lul
[2:29:15] <%Javaa01> And you really only get infinite durability melee weapons in the post game
[2:29:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Majima's final Nunchaku weapon is just King Cerberus
[2:29:17] <+Tucker0603> it hits fast and all around you
[2:29:17] <+MugenSandan> are nunchucks vs nunchaku the original ITS PRONOUNCED SAIYA-JIN
[2:29:18] <Fkain23> best weapon is gold shot gun or normal gun
[2:29:20] <hkgamingtv> You can definately get infinite Kali sticks tho
[2:29:20] <+Idziman> does V not know about the infinite durability weapons?
[2:29:22] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I can't stop being myself dude
[2:29:33] <+SeedTabulous> Demonfire Dagger PogChamp
[2:29:36] <jacksonomar> If you can get a sturdy version of a weapon it can fuction like the default bat
[2:29:48] <President_valentine> no you can use it in thug
[2:29:49] <+SeedTabulous> The weapon movesets work with slugger actually
[2:29:52] <coreyyotto> It's from the fight in front of the arcade. If you steal a weapon and switch styles, it pockets the weapon
[2:29:55] <Dhurkst> @nekros4442 seriously. it's ridiculous how loose chat has been with series spoilers throughout this LP
[2:30:01] <dukenux> would be rude to just stab your sensei
[2:30:06] <majindusto> GO ALL BRUCE LEE WITH NUNCHUCKS
[2:30:06] <andre11dr> I don't know the scimitar to me is still the craziest murder heat move, where he fucking kicks it threw their body
[2:30:07] <WG101> wallbounced
[2:30:08] <+Mendin> @coreyyotto No he got it from the tutorial equipment supply run
[2:30:14] <+Mendin> The disarm gives you it for that fight only
[2:30:15] <+tigerfang86> it really is Swordmaster style
[2:30:20] <8bitdana> @Dhurkst a lot of it is just overall discussion, minimal spoilers
[2:30:20] <+botchdogg> Weapons are stronger in slugger
[2:30:24] <exnuart> it doesn't matter
[2:30:27] <+Stupid121v2> back chucked
[2:30:31] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:30:33] <@Solidus_113> backswing
[2:30:34] <+Ether101_Prime> Does equip a bat while in Slugger do you get to the moves with it?
[2:30:34] <WG101> DONK
[2:30:34] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> the arc for that one slugger swing is wild
[2:30:37] <DasFreekman> Yeah I'm not gonna wait ten years for woolie to get to the later games, I'm gonna talk about whatever
[2:30:37] <+Mendin> DEAD ANGLE'D
[2:30:50] <%doomerskeletor13> There is an ability that makes weapons stronger in slugger style iirc
[2:31:02] <%Reverend_Roscoe> It's not just about Woolie, you dicks
[2:31:09] <@akuda_bar> @Dhurkst wish i could be more helpful, i've only played 0 so i can't tell if i'm looking at a spoiler
[2:31:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> other people are playing and watching this
[2:31:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @dasfreekman Yakuza 7 LP coming 2031
[2:31:15] <+Mendin> Ah, it's the Shotel
[2:31:16] <DSD24> @DasFreekman I get what you are saying man, but you don't know who else is watching the stream
[2:31:25] <%Javaa01> Guard Break and big damage Heat moves
[2:31:26] <+Mendin> I think he also just said it generates more Heta
[2:31:28] <Darren716> I mean 0 assumed you played 1-4
[2:31:28] <+Mendin> *Heat
[2:31:30] <OblivionSword1> pee break
[2:31:36] <8bitdana> chat was just discussing characters from later games, that appear on the cover art
[2:31:36] <Darren716> So those should be free to discuss
[2:31:40] <DasFreekman> Yeah and most of the info is useless without context
[2:31:41] <+Stupid121v2> V looks like hes about to give an apple presentation lol
[2:31:48] <8bitdana> lmao
[2:31:49] <exnuart> @Darren716 no it doesnt
[2:31:50] <hkgamingtv> lol
[2:31:53] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> @Darren716 it references them sure, but a LOT of people use 0 as a starting point
[2:31:56] <@akuda_bar> @Stupid121v2 he's about to announce the iLittleV
[2:32:00] <akman14> Nani?
[2:32:01] <Darren716> It literally references what happens in 4
[2:32:02] <SunsetJack> Wut?

[2:32:10] <RyuuAoi> Wha happen
[2:32:11] <Dhurkst> @velgaduere It's still inconsistent, and people would appreciate the historical info they're carelessly skipping.
[2:32:11] <+jiggy_snipe> here comes baby jail morons
[2:32:11] <Josef_Stryker> ?
[2:32:12] <+Grayhammatter> D:

[2:36:51] <+Liquid_Dio> It's a gun
[2:36:51] <+runegod20> the katana technically isn't the last one you learn, you just needed to do the nunchucks first for some reason

[2:37:53] <+DGenerator> DOG BUTT AGAIN
[2:37:55] <OldManDeckardCain> it's actually 1000 folds if anything, if you avtually did it 1000 timers it'd break like a million times by that point LUL

[2:38:50] <VidulaSaix> This is ESSENCE OF BAT in its true form
[2:38:54] <%doomerskeletor13> For some reason it felt like the katana was easier to beat than the others
[2:38:57] <velgaduere> @turbofolk are you serious? did you not hear anything Woolie was just talking about?
[2:39:03] <+ondri21> yo as i watch this game, why the hell did anyone ask for shenmue back
[2:39:04] <+Stupid121v2> Ishin localization when :(
[2:39:07] <bakkatohri> The whole wall hitting thing with the bat is so annoying. Like why did they do this?
[2:39:09] <OblivionSword1> keep that corner game tight
[2:39:11] <misterbarkley> superior american steel (slugger)
[2:39:16] <andre11dr> Nah ,I'll point out the best battle theme when we get there, bur we're like 80 hours away from that

[2:39:26] <+Liquid_Dio> KAPOW
[2:39:26] <The_EasilyBoredGamer> @bakkatohri bat too strong otherwise i guess
[2:39:26] <penitentpendant> That'd be an interesting mechanic in a fighting game, if whiffing in a corner caused knockback on the attacker
[2:39:29] <%Animatic_> home run
[2:39:31] <velgaduere> bat good. big bonk.
[2:39:32] <Blank9> Ishin might be the best Yakuza, it's incredible. Played through it and 5 in japanese.
[2:39:32] <TheHoodedTeddy13> A Polish Saber is just better on all aspects. It's the same weapon, but made of better steel and actually with a guard that's worth a damn
[2:39:35] <+Grayhammatter> home run!
[2:39:41] <WhereIsWill> bested? it was a SLAUGHTER LUL

[2:41:33] <TheHoodedTeddy13> Aw man, does Woolie know about Hellish Quart?
[2:41:39] <dukenux> @jiggy_snipe i imagine showing up with a claymore could be pretty menacing
[2:41:40] <exnuart> theres equipment to keep you from raising heat
[2:41:45] <%gnarly_memes_bro> there is an accessory that prevents heat gain

[2:41:56] <BlackermanZX> Give them the Jason Todd treatment

[2:44:18] <Brunty023> @AhmCha Soooo... a normal Yakuza playthrough LUL
[2:44:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Whatever style you were in when you pull out the weapon is the style you’ll have
[2:44:19] <+runegod20> pressing down pulls out a weapon but changing to slugger auto pulls out the bat, but you can still change to the equipped weapon in slugger
[2:44:23] <flame_of_udun_> Yeah there’s a list of heat moves
[2:44:27] <%FiniteMonster> @ahmcha Substories are life
[2:44:27] <OblivionSword1> do the knife heat moves basically
[2:44:30] <+Stupid121v2> Better knife later
[2:44:30] <flame_of_udun_> It tells you how to do them
[2:44:30] <hkgamingtv> can be worth it but not now

[2:44:46] <OblivionSword1> slugger heat moves work pretty well
[2:44:46] <%RadicalWeegee> HMMM noooo Thug better
[2:44:48] <DasFreekman> point of note, losing to shakedown is annoying but never a detriment, it will only add to his total
[2:44:49] <notsoy> no, only use the weapons for heat moves
[2:44:50] <hkgamingtv> heat moves & tauriners
[2:44:51] <+botchdogg> Not until you get the spicy knife
[2:44:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SLIME GUN
[2:44:56] <%Javaa01> You use the weapons for heat moves, not regular attacks
[2:44:57] <kingstupidthethird> You also have an extra heat move if you do it the moment you take out the dagger
[2:44:57] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s only a few weapons that are good against him
[2:44:58] <exnuart> shakedown meta is heat spam not souls play

[2:48:19] <hkgamingtv> you'll figure it out woolie, the style switching isn;t necessary
[2:48:25] <DasFreekman> once you get some heat retention skill it'll be a lot easier to spam heat moves
[2:48:30] <primaryfire> it's far less risky to do massive heat move damage than to go for 2 hits a hundred times on an enemy with super armour
[2:48:33] <%big_laser_boss> Oh, he’s using the heavy attack for finishers. That’s good
[2:48:37] <%M3djedx> veiS veiS

[2:49:18] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I think its technically a club?? not really sure, it works like the slapstick does
[2:49:19] <+runegod20> aren't most basic heatmoves at least 1 bar?
[2:49:19] <primaryfire> @andre11dr it doesn't
[2:49:19] <notsoy> majima gets different heat moves at different heat levels
[2:49:28] <whirly25> dont let him shooreh your pippi

[2:50:34] <Vashido22> woolie you're thinking about this too hard
[2:50:43] <+runegod20> pulling out the bat is apart of his animation to changing into that style
[2:50:44] <%FiniteMonster> that is true
[2:50:45] <hkgamingtv> the weapons are less important, it's more about the heat moves

[2:50:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Slugger makes them more powerful I think

[2:51:00] <flame_of_udun_> @brunoberserk I...don’t know lol
[2:51:02] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m having flashbacks to DMC 5 and Dr Faust
[2:51:09] <user_naim> But what does it do in GUNSLINGER
[2:51:09] <DasFreekman> think of it like Weapon is a forth stance
[2:51:11] <+botchdogg> It's a gun woolie
[2:51:12] <Solidnick18> YEAH
[2:51:13] <+runegod20> slugger is better for using weapons in the same way that beast is better than rush and brawler for using weapons
[2:51:15] <panic_rabbit> weapon is like an unlabeled style of its own

[2:59:53] <+Stupid121v2> Sagawa is such a slimy fuck I love em
[2:59:58] <heylookitswex> i am just waiting for a heatmove that literally decapitates someone
[2:59:59] <velgaduere> they're giving Sagawa a relatable American persona
[3:00:00] <+aram909> sagawa is both cool and a total asshole at the same time
[3:00:01] <%gnarly_memes_bro> he's a great antagonist
[3:00:02] <damienlunas> oh yeah motherfucking ODEN
[3:00:02] <MyNameIsRasus> Localization is pretty free, and I love it

[3:00:09] <President_valentine> Sagawa is awful i love him
[3:00:11] <iswearimjustdandy> Its the tone

[3:00:40] <majindusto> Delicious Sake
[3:00:42] <+runegod20> says the man making us get another 500 mil for him
[3:00:43] <@akuda_bar> in this case he might have said "sit down" but super informally so they needed a way of telling an english reader that he's being condescending
[3:00:45] <+0neReeler> oden
[3:00:45] <%SilverDevilfish> Mmmm delicious steamed children toy blocks
[3:00:49] <MyNameIsRasus> good pour
[3:00:50] <%Asuterisuku> With some hot sake
[3:00:50] <%X2Eliah> How are people so chill with eating street food? Like... y'all aren't afraid of food poisoning?
[3:00:51] <damienlunas> Can confirm Daikon in oden broth is delicious

[3:01:03] <DasFreekman> WOW
[3:01:04] <+Ether101_Prime> Look at that liquid.
[3:01:07] <penitentpendant> Considering all the money Majima has given, he'd definetly more than paid for this already
[3:01:07] <BlackermanZX> is there a drug in there doodWat
[3:01:08] <Kaito_Cam> The disrespect
[3:01:08] <dukenux> i keep forgetting sake's supposed to be drank hot
[3:01:09] <MyNameIsRasus> C H U G
[3:01:10] <%aram909> @X2Eliah ive gotten food poisoning more from restaurants than street food/tiny hole in the wall places
[3:01:10] <TheHoodedTeddy13> I have a theory in Yakuza games, that how laid back a character is is directly tied to how unbuttoned their suit is
[3:01:11] <Ultimatefool> @X2Eliah It tastes like 3x better
[3:01:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Liquid tech

[3:02:14] <+runegod20> i feel like a cart like this would be safer than something like hotdog cart but the fear never leaves
[3:02:20] <heylookitswex> can majima even see that he wanted to clink glasses?
[3:02:25] <hkgamingtv> Shogogecki No Soma?
[3:02:28] <+MagiKestral> why would they pay to animate a conversation

[3:05:55] <+runegod20> isn't both murder and crimes with a gun extra bad in japan too?
[3:05:56] <penitentpendant> @flame_of_udun_ Taiga Genocide, if you would
[3:05:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Has to be on separate occasions to count as serial killer....think its just spree as is
[3:06:10] <reonome> woolie should have watched the y4 lp Kappa
[3:06:10] <flame_of_udun_> @penitentpendant nice
[3:06:15] <hkgamingtv> GROWN ASS MAN
[3:06:16] <RyuuAoi> It's because people think they are funny, but in all actuality, it's pretty pathetic.
[3:06:19] <Blank9> In japan, owning a gun will get you at least 5 years in jail, not even using or threatening to use it.
[3:06:21] <PerfidiousSinn> you can't have a gun in Japan...that's illegal
[3:06:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie will get to Yakuza 4 in 2028
[3:06:24] <alvaroeltz> oh shit, just noticed about what sagawa said
[3:06:34] <hkgamingtv> shiiiit

[3:06:41] <+AbnormalVoid> Riker Question
[3:06:42] <+runegod20> a serial killer only kills 1 person at a time, if they kill multiple people at a time than it should technically be a spree killer, fun fact

[3:06:43] <WG101> "motherfucker, i saw you kill those goons before"

[3:07:05] <DasFreekman> Flash back 5 min to the neck snap
[3:07:07] <@Menitta> Could you imagine how unstoppable serial killers would be if they had killstreaks
[3:07:08] <MyNameIsRasus> HE WAS NAPPING
[3:07:09] <+cloudman_exe> I mean the dude who took a crobar to the face
[3:07:11] <+runegod20> eh, a shakedown can handle it
[3:07:12] <TheHoodedTeddy13> I feel like there's a disconnect in what the definition of spoiler is. Some people say literally any detail about a future game is a spoiler, some say that it's just important plot reveals that are spoilers
[3:07:18] <brachydios777> It’s fine
[3:07:18] <+0neReeler> nobody dies
[3:07:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sagawas such a scum I love him
[3:07:20] <PerfidiousSinn> you can snap someone's neck without killing them, just be really careful it's fine
[3:07:20] <R3c0n31> Nah, he walking with like 2 foot deep knife wounds

[3:07:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @andre11dr Akiyama?
[3:07:35] <+Deano8817> @TheHoodedTeddy13 woolie has established he's of the 1st camp, so yeah
[3:07:36] <notsoy> akiyama isn't actually yakuza
[3:07:38] <President_valentine> Akiyama ain't got one
[3:07:39] <+MagiKestral> we already know that the saejima cutscenes came from 4, cause V said they were from 4. that's as far as I'm willing to say
[3:07:39] <Equirah> @0neReeler sht. the fuck. up
[3:07:40] <penitentpendant> Not looking up, not looking up
[3:07:45] <President_valentine> he's a civilian
[3:07:47] <MyNameIsRasus> How do you think he kept in business woolie? He knows what to ignore
[3:07:49] <brachydios777> @andre11dr He doesn’t have a tattoo, he ain’t Yakuza
[3:07:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Chef is there like monkaS
[3:07:55] <DasFreekman> he just does SKY CRIMES
[3:08:00] <%Asuterisuku> Oh the chef is definitely Omi.
[3:08:00] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @thehoodedteddy13 i think after woolie's direct address to chat earlier its better just to avoid talking about the later games here
[3:08:00] <8bitdana> dude gotta go
[3:08:03] <andre11dr> Oh iea that's right
[3:08:04] <%gatorafan> wow, what a docuhe
[3:08:06] <PerfidiousSinn> oh yeah k*ll dat dude
[3:08:07] <jorniev> cheff is probably IN on it, or konws when to mind his buisness
[3:08:10] <TheHoodedTeddy13> got it
[3:08:13] <+cloudman_exe> He. Gotta. Go.
[3:08:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Hmmm
[3:08:18] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah pretty murderable
[3:08:21] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL
[3:08:23] <Dhurkst> IIRC, there's a very small range of legal guns in Japan, that you probably have to apply for licenses to own, like single-shot hunting rifles or something.
[3:08:24] <flame_of_udun_> Time to kill him
[3:08:28] <%BlueJoneleth> You know, they probably shouldn't plan a murder in front of the store owner :D
[3:08:29] <dayspring815> Akiyama got SUPER CHUNK on his back
[3:08:31] <PerfidiousSinn> is the telephone club minigame in this game?
[3:08:33] <%Asuterisuku> And there's the name
[3:08:34] <+runegod20> didn't he say that he liked to go to this cart? Probably isn't the first time he did something like this here
[3:08:34] <andre11dr> It's been like 4 years since since i played 5 i don't remember everything
[3:08:36] <Ookamiden02> Oh yeah, the telephone club
[3:08:38] <hkgamingtv> if ur not sure if it's a spoiler then you should prolly not say
[3:08:39] <alvaroeltz> no, ill stab him multiple time, but i refuse to kill him
[3:08:40] <%Grimlockfly> telephone cluuuuub
[3:08:43] <MonstarGrrrl> talk to GIRLS???
[3:08:45] <notsoy> that store owner ain't saying SHIT, lmao
[3:08:47] <R3c0n31> Oh yea the telephone club
[3:08:47] <+jiggy_snipe> are they just planning a murder in front of this chef?!
[3:08:49] <TheHoodedTeddy13> god, Sagawa's face is so familiar to me for some reason, but I can't figure out from where
[3:08:50] <MyNameIsRasus> Telephone Clubs, aka DEF NOT PROSTITUTION GUYS
[3:08:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Telephone clubs babyyy
[3:08:55] <Ultimatefool> Honestly feels like Majima has the main story in this game and Kiryu is an addon LUL
[3:08:58] <+talkingrain3139> @PerfidiousSinn yes
[3:09:00] <@Menitta> The chef is working SUPER HARD to hear it
[3:09:01] <notsoy> you KNOW this chef is gonna keep his mouth shut
[3:09:02] <+cloudman_exe> The cook is just minding his own business while two guys are conspiring a murder
[3:09:02] <hkgamingtv> cooks aren't ppl
[3:09:09] <%RadicalWeegee> WHA- Gg-g-g-g-g-GIRLS?1 *Gulp*
[3:09:11] <@Menitta> to not hear it*
[3:09:13] <hkgamingtv> I should know
[3:09:14] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s an Android clearly
[3:09:15] <flame_of_udun_> @ultimatefool they’re both equally important
[3:09:23] <%FiniteMonster> Segawa probably picked this place for a reason
[3:09:24] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> the store owner is johny tight lips
[3:09:25] <agustorm123> He telling that but why? LUL
[3:09:26] <%UberWolfman> Cook is totally not on Sagawa's tab
[3:09:29] <%gnarly_memes_bro> that chef hears shitnlike this all the time, discretion is part of the job for food service people always
[3:09:29] <+runegod20> but what if it was self defense, or killing a shitty person, or defending someone else?
[3:09:29] <DasFreekman> Yakuza 0 IS Majimas story
[3:09:33] <Dhurkst> @ultimatefool right?
[3:09:33] <OldManDeckardCain> those telephone clubs were shut down by government because they tied it to prostitution btw LUL
[3:09:35] <%FiniteMonster> cook didn't see shit
[3:09:35] <%osaka_daioh> it's true
[3:09:40] <+runegod20> killing is always bad stuff always bothers me
[3:09:43] <PerfidiousSinn> if I saw 2 yakuza plotting murder in front of me, I would simply mind my business
[3:09:45] <President_valentine> unless the chef wants to be disappeared he knows to keep his mouth shut
[3:09:49] <+Grayhammatter> cook ain't saying shit
[3:09:50] <R3c0n31> got deep for a bit there
[3:09:55] <Thebrobro911> well too late for that
[3:09:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Sagawa is surprisingly considerate
[3:10:08] <%gnarly_memes_bro> He still runs that cart because he knows how to stay quiet
[3:10:08] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe he's a yakuza chef
[3:10:09] <%Asuterisuku> Something of note; Makoto is a unisex name used by both men and women.
[3:10:11] <Byr0nX> Chef, you heard nothing
[3:10:14] <digitalslime> cook still just being a cook.
[3:10:14] <Byr0nX> ORA
[3:10:16] <MyNameIsRasus> God making Daikon sure is LOUD
[3:10:17] <TheHoodedTeddy13> I imagine Sagawa and that chef have an understanding
[3:10:18] <%gatorafan> What a feisty bunch :)
[3:10:18] <Josef_Stryker> Sagawa is an asshole but he's got a point
[3:10:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the chef is the Ramen Guy in Naruto
[3:10:20] <penitentpendant> Didn't hear nothing about screaming about Yakuza
[3:10:22] <hkgamingtv> YES CHEF
[3:10:24] <flame_of_udun_> Chef doesn’t get paid enough for this
[3:10:24] <Monkeyweed21> WHO WANTS TASTY ODEN?
[3:10:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Yakuza Chef
[3:10:29] <%NaLLex9> turn your brain off
[3:10:29] <agustorm123> The cheff probably killed more people with that fugu poison
[3:10:32] <%FiniteMonster> Japan has tons of unisex names
[3:10:32] <@Solidus_113> I prefer Minato Aristato
[3:10:38] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> like makoto yuki and makoto niijima
[3:10:39] <%FiniteMonster> Tsukasa
[3:10:41] <$Invlux> That dude's on the take
[3:10:42] <TheHoodedTeddy13> Chef knows what would happen if he blabs
[3:10:43] <+runegod20> god minato is such a better name
