[0:01:45] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> @woolieversus would it help to buy a docking station with more usb hubs?
[0:01:45] <heartlesshealer> every time I pause or refresh I get the damn 30 second ad that desyncs the stream. Twitch why
[0:01:49] <%korth367> when was the last time you just turned the laptop off
[0:02:13] <NireFuster> what's the difference between regular obs and streamlabs?

[0:02:54] <DesertPenguin> That place is for cheapos
[0:02:57] <+CptBritches> Golden Corral haha
[0:02:59] <%emperordread> Golden Coral kicks ass
[0:03:03] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:03:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[0:03:06] <ELFucilaNeroIV> LUL
[0:03:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's so good yet so bad
[0:03:08] <DesertPenguin> It's the cheap place for low income families
[0:03:09] <Jrocy247> Yea but Golden Corral is fucking stale and boring
[0:03:11] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Golden Coral is struggle tier food
[0:03:11] <dinnydanny777> Chinese buffet is delicious
[0:03:14] <%CptnCampy61> Golden Corral is awful
[0:03:16] <%BisoromiBear> it's where you go if you want to be american sized
[0:03:18] <+speaks2much> for peasants
[0:03:22] <+tealplague> golden coral is a terrible and i love it

[0:03:34] <DesertPenguin> But Denny's is great right?
[0:03:34] <dinnydanny777> Although when you find a nice pub/restaurant in the UK Roast Buffet is delicious
[0:03:35] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> when I lived in washington DC, WaWa was the shitttt
[0:03:35] <Jrocy247> WAFFLE HOUSE IS THE SHIT
[0:03:36] <+CptBritches> Cracker Barrel is my shit
[0:03:39] <Parapattern> Golden Corral is the bottom tier like the Cracker Barrel
[0:03:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they're ok
[0:03:40] <DesertPenguin> Can we agree that Denny's is good?
[0:03:41] <masterfire23> oh yeah Golden corral i forgot that existed
[0:03:42] <socratetris> My local Golden Corral has a few lights out, so at night it reads, " GOLD ORAL"
[0:03:43] <+tealplague> WAFFLE HOUSE ALL DAY
[0:03:48] <Djinnazz> AND a gift shop.

[0:05:30] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Every aspect of our country is about wallowing in excess
[0:05:31] <+evbites> our child size is roughly the size of a child
[0:05:31] <socratetris> @upsman Donuts can be a dirty word all on its own

[0:09:46] <DesertPenguin> Game audio is low
[0:10:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok so it's not just me
[0:10:13] <NireFuster> So I suppose this entire game you'll be recruiting people to help you save your uncle like BOTW and the champions?
[0:10:15] <dinnydanny777> Violence breeds violence
[0:10:17] <DesertPenguin> It's low compared to the guys
[0:10:36] <DesertPenguin> Maybe it's just voice volume
[0:10:36] <+Solutha> they killed them tho?
[0:10:41] <Archmortal> Woolie, was the territory empty two days ago
[0:10:43] <+EternalJedi> dinnydanny777 limesD Magic must defeat Magic

[0:10:45] <Pyrrhus90> its literaly free real state
[0:10:49] <DianaTheAscian> they killed the can that was woolie
[0:10:50] <alexandrecau> @NireFuster no that's just first act
[0:10:51] <jubejube56> Pretty sure it is implied the rival clan is the one who killed Clan Adachi
[0:10:51] <%gnoame> It's free real estate now that they're all dead.
[0:10:54] <DianaTheAscian> here*
[0:10:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> Considering they orchestrated their deaths, yes it's par for the course

[0:12:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Is he doing the Mythic quest?
[0:12:46] <NireFuster> NO HONOR
[0:12:48] <DesertPenguin> Use kung fu
[0:12:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> Calling for help is a pat move
[0:12:48] <+CptBritches> The dude would just die
[0:12:49] <alexandrecau> Die with honor
[0:12:50] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus WOOLIE
[0:12:50] <%Josef_Stryker> "My youthful soul is filled with bitch"
[0:12:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> the art direction sold me
[0:12:51] <%thechungiestofbois> most metal intro card
[0:12:52] <%jiggy_snipe> big punches
[0:12:52] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> @cyoctane Whatever he decides to do will be great. =) I'm loving this commentary.
[0:12:54] <BisoromiBear> no sword style
[0:12:59] <+evbites> enter sadness
[0:12:59] <T_Sasquatch> Not leave your family like a bitch
[0:12:59] <DesertPenguin> Tail?
[0:13:02] <+Doc1790> O
[0:13:02] <DesertPenguin> You get a tail?
[0:13:07] <NireFuster> 'I'll save your wife later'
[0:13:08] <TioXyco> it's because you began Masako's sidequest
[0:13:10] <+Caped_Eggy> Die like a bitch
[0:13:15] <%stormhawk9891> Yo fuck your family
[0:13:18] <alexandrecau> Honor Woolie
[0:13:19] <DesertPenguin> NO FUCK IT JUST DIE WITH HONOR
[0:13:20] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus that one is short btw
[0:13:27] <%BisoromiBear> family should have run faster
[0:13:34] <Reizie_Etherealm> Fist VS swords and arrows? Not good odds
[0:13:35] <NireFuster> Fuck your wife and kids I'll deal with it later gotta get a sick new upgrade
[0:13:36] <+CptBritches> If he didn't leave to find someone to help then he would've just been slaughtered and not even have the possibility of actually helping them
[0:13:39] <theCoolChild> You just said fuck this man's family too
[0:13:40] <DesertPenguin> Family should have ran away with him
[0:13:42] <+evbites> family should have made traps
[0:13:42] <DesertPenguin> They're dead now
[0:13:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> Family should've ran with him tbh
[0:13:45] <dinnydanny777> But die with honour or live like a coward
[0:13:48] <Pyrrhus90> my wife and kinds will leave in my heart LUL
[0:13:48] <alexandrecau> You die with your family or you run with them
[0:13:50] <DianaTheAscian> ABANDON YOUR FAMILY TO DIE SAYs WOOLIE
[0:13:50] <%gnoame> Use your body to slow down your enemies
[0:13:50] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly id rather die fighting than literally running away from my wife and kids LUL
[0:13:52] <JetpackMcQuack> You do you
[0:13:54] <Pyrrhus90> kids*
[0:13:55] <DesertPenguin> They're probably dead already
[0:14:16] <+evbites> i'm running those ain't my kids shelia
[0:14:17] <%BisoromiBear> you can find another family, there's only one you
[0:14:24] <%ChoculaUltra> A lot of the side quests deal with “what is honor, really?” and I love it
[0:14:27] <Djinnazz> or they run away
[0:14:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> Die together or survive together, no one left behind
[0:14:33] <dinnydanny777> Imagine blocking an attack so impressively that someone becomes petrified
[0:14:41] <%doomerskeletor13> They already had his family, he was running to get help. If he stayed and died it would’ve solved nothing, at least this way he can get help
[0:14:43] <%chiazam> Terrified enemies either fall to the ground or RUN LIKE A BITCH
[0:14:43] <+evbites> alot of side quests end with dead kids
[0:14:44] <dinnydanny777> "AIYEEEE HE BLOCKED AN ATTACK"
[0:14:47] <DesertPenguin> Honor is not being a coward
[0:14:54] <%CptnCampy61> Missed an outfit at the springs
[0:14:57] <+CptBritches> The two options are just die which is a 0% chance of your family surviving, or try to find an armed person nearby which at least a small chance to get them help
[0:15:01] <+Arkfyre> you can just hold block
[0:15:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> "Yo we can't get a single hit in! This guy's untouchable! RUN!"
[0:15:27] <+JM_FUNK> yup just hold block and Jin will deflect arrows
[0:15:27] <NireFuster> It's probably because you were in the grandma's quest
[0:15:28] <alexandrecau> Yo he zeroed to death a guy with a shield
[0:15:29] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> everybody says they would do this or that but lets be honest, very few people in the world are able to face violence headon. Its a skill
[0:15:32] <%thechungiestofbois> FUCK YO FAMILY
[0:15:36] <T_Sasquatch> @cptbritches assuming they don't kill , rape or enslave them by the time you get help
[0:15:37] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Wait... so there is a whole skill tree dedicated to parries!?
[0:15:40] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> I know i would not be able too
[0:15:49] <dinnydanny777> It's SICK though
[0:15:50] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> shits scary and there is nothing wrong with that
[0:15:56] <%ChoculaUltra> Yep, 1 parry tree and 1 dodge tree
[0:15:59] <alexandrecau> one tree for parries one for evasion and four for stances
[0:16:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> To be fair you'd run too if you're many versus 1 guy and he starts daigo parrying all your collective attacks
[0:16:11] <DianaTheAscian> is this blue flower thing?
[0:16:13] <+CptBritches> @T_Sasquatch They would just do that right after they killed you anyways. If you stayed then you wouldn't change anything
[0:16:20] <alexandrecau> ITachi
[0:16:22] <NireFuster> SUSANOO

[0:16:55] <NeoCre> @nanaki_ff14 I’m hoping for the bow
[0:16:56] <TioXyco> this is good to make thumbnails
[0:16:57] <T_Sasquatch> @cptbritches true but running away is oof
[0:16:59] <NireFuster> How far away can you move the camera? Would it let you see through walls?
[0:17:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> Make him ahegao
[0:17:03] <dinnydanny777> Can you make him say CHEESE?
[0:17:11] <dinnydanny777> Can you make him stick his tongue out?

[0:17:47] <+CptBritches> @T_Sasquatch Doing nothing to possibly help your family is probably a larger oof. It would still feel terrible, but it's a horrifying situation with no good outcome

[0:19:27] <+evbites> no anime shit
[0:19:38] <Archmortal> I had no idea lightning beasts were real creatures in history
[0:19:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's called a legend. Those things real people believed even though they weren't true.
[0:19:40] <NireFuster> It's just a story Woolie
[0:19:40] <VidulaSaix> "Accurate"
[0:19:42] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:19:44] <Nekros4442> It's a myth for a reason Woolie
[0:19:46] <jorniev> IZANAGI
[0:19:50] <%YakumoYomi> "Historical Accurate"
[0:19:50] <%chiazam> "HISTORICALLY ACCURATE"
[0:19:50] <T_Sasquatch> (honestly it kinda sucks as an ability imo)
[0:19:53] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s a myth quest
[0:19:55] <VidulaSaix> There ya go
[0:19:58] <alexandrecau> "realistic"
[0:19:59] <Prevot> people believe dumber shit IRL
[0:20:03] <jorniev> HYPER REALISM
[0:20:09] <+evbites> they were just rabies filled albino wolves
[0:20:12] <london_flexing> "historical accurate" "historical realistic"
[0:20:27] <thesickestzak> You weren't there Woolie! Maybe the thunder puppies were real! nliCry
[0:20:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> historical fiction ;)
[0:20:29] <morningmoondude> "historically appropriate bankais"
[0:20:29] <jorniev> THIS IS NO TIGER KING

[0:20:53] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> I am a historian so I can say Who gives a shit lol its a video game
[0:20:53] <alexandrecau> You just started give it time
[0:21:03] <%YakumoYomi> You don't know. YOU WEREN'T THERE, WOOLIE.
[0:21:38] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> Granted my area of east asian history expertise is 18th through 20th century
[0:21:39] <+Jasuchin> You can call your horse, she'll get one too
[0:21:45] <alexandrecau> Jin does not want anyone to live after what they do
[0:22:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> Everyone in this game gets a horse like it's a rental
[0:22:13] <%BisoromiBear> didn't put the toilet seat down? he will pay with his life.
[0:22:16] <+evbites> fight the electric wolves gow 4
[0:22:19] <+solzan2000> I like to just run
[0:22:19] <NireFuster> I wonder if it's *that* easy to follow footprints on eral life
[0:22:24] <morningmoondude> use the rasengan
[0:22:25] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> or some parts of the path are more senistive than others

[0:22:47] <+callowbrodie> barbPAIN
[0:22:56] <+evbites> look slaves
[0:23:00] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> switch stances by dude wooly
[0:23:01] <NireFuster> Casually approach the mongols
[0:23:03] <+Jasuchin> Wrong stance
[0:23:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[0:23:07] <alexandrecau> Stance matter when you break guard woolie
[0:23:13] <+CptBritches> Nice honor you have there
[0:23:15] <morningmoondude> back up and eat potions, with honor
[0:23:19] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> STANCES
[0:23:21] <+TheDandyGuy> those are some loud arrows
[0:23:21] <+Cyoctane> I can't wait until Wolie gets to enemies that fakeout in standoffs
[0:23:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Stone stance is more effective against swordsman
[0:23:23] <+linSP> do combo yeye
[0:23:24] <+evbites> stone
[0:23:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> monkaS
[0:23:29] <+seduwu> Stance switch
[0:23:36] <theCoolChild> But where's my Hanauta Sancho: Yahazu Giri
[0:23:38] <%EdenOfLove> Is this game souls difficulty cuz i wanna get it but if it's that hard i wont
[0:23:51] <doomerskeletor13> It’s not as punishing as a souls game
[0:23:51] <+CptBritches> Trading blows
[0:23:55] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Man the combat looks so good! Has there ever been a game with such great sword clashes besides Zoe 2?
[0:23:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> Suffer for now LUL
[0:23:56] <+TheDandyGuy> its easier
[0:23:56] <+Arkfyre> It snot that hard
[0:24:00] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @EdenOfLove its hard but not nearly that hard
[0:24:01] <%thechungiestofbois> STONWATESTONEMOONWIND
[0:24:05] <@Menitta> Its not that hard but its not a cakewalk
[0:24:06] <alexandrecau> @EdenOfLove T's assassins creed difficulty
[0:24:10] <xbb1024> Woolie keeps getting hit
[0:24:12] <jorniev> JIN KICK
[0:24:15] <NireFuster> Is ending their suffering the asian equivalent to finish them rightly?
[0:24:15] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> harding than assassins creed
[0:24:17] <+CptBritches> It's really not that hard, still feels rewarding tho
[0:24:19] <%EdenOfLove> so easier than sekiro cuz i bounced off that SUPER hard
[0:24:21] <NeoCre> It’s close to it on Hard.
[0:24:22] <%EdenOfLove> cuz i couldnt do it
[0:24:25] <@Menitta> Id say its harder than AC
[0:24:26] <%EdenOfLove> i couldn't beat lady butterfly
[0:24:27] <morningmoondude> this mongol stew has no honor
[0:24:38] <%doomerskeletor13> @edenoflove Much easier, but still challenging at times
[0:24:46] <%SirGO0SE> worf mod would rule in this game
[0:24:48] <alexandrecau> Harder but not by much your ghost weapon and stealth is busted
[0:24:53] <jorniev> JIN KICK
[0:24:54] <+Jasuchin> DIVE KICK
[0:24:56] <+Arkfyre> As long as you're stance switching to the right enemy type, it's easy mode
[0:25:14] <+Arkfyre> Also you can soften up enemy camps with stealth first unlike woolie is doing
[0:25:18] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> its like a movie
[0:25:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Damn race traitor
[0:25:29] <+evbites> shhhh plot for later
[0:25:34] <+phantomcheez> Play the flute to change the weather
[0:25:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:25:37] <+TheDandyGuy> such is a samurais skill
[0:25:39] <+phantomcheez> Do it
[0:25:50] <+Caped_Eggy> Tsushima is florida
[0:25:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh wow I didn’t know that actually
[0:25:53] <NireFuster> Does the camera mode weather change affect the ingame weather?
[0:25:54] <alexandrecau> You need cricket for your flute to change wether
[0:25:54] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Liberate AIR
[0:25:54] <%chiazam> You can't kill NPCs
[0:25:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> behold my demons
[0:26:08] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> Its chinese
[0:26:09] <+phantomcheez> The first song is like the clear sky weather song
[0:26:09] <theCoolChild> a little
[0:26:12] <+evbites> he had to read art of war
[0:26:13] <dinnydanny777> Maybe they wrote it in Japanese?
[0:26:15] <%thechungiestofbois> he knows a little
[0:26:17] <+ladomania> Chinese
[0:26:18] <%chiazam> He can read some Chinese
[0:26:20] <%doomerskeletor13> He can read some Chinese
[0:26:22] <Nekros4442> It's likely chinese
[0:26:23] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> oh wait no its a japanese guy
[0:26:24] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus Jin read sun tzu as long as the mongolian use chinese he can figure it out
[0:26:24] <+Cyoctane> I mean you can literally change the weather with the flute, they went for style over realism
[0:26:30] <+Jasuchin> There's an actual explanation. He can read Chinese
[0:26:31] <thesickestzak> He explains later
[0:26:32] <NeoCre> He can read Chinese remember?
[0:26:35] <%vVAstrAVv> its actually explained later
[0:26:35] <%chiazam> He talks about it later
[0:26:49] <jorniev> fire
[0:26:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah he mentions that he’s read Sun Tzu
[0:26:54] <NeoCre> Isn’t that talked about in the first archer quest?
[0:26:59] <T_Sasquatch> Can you guys NOT ANSWER everything woolie asks
[0:27:03] <T_Sasquatch> LUL

[0:27:15] <xbb1024> I thought Woolie was going to jump into the heystack
[0:27:21] <%chiazam> I can't not answer questions
[0:27:23] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I like how the weather is tied to gameplay, do dishonorable stuff and it gets stormier.
[0:27:25] <NeoCre> @t_sasquatch no
[0:27:33] <+CptBritches> No, we love our Woolie too much :)

This in addition to their separate localizations for the Japanese and English tracks., and subtitles appearing as words are spoken.
[0:29:06] <theCoolChild> Kikiyo?
[0:29:10] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> the COMMIES protection
[0:29:13] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> damn reds

[0:30:09] <Djinnazz> blind
[0:30:12] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> wait no you missed it!!!
[0:30:13] <+evbites> nooo woolz
[0:30:26] <jorniev> were is the glider when you need it
[0:30:28] <T_Sasquatch> Some are pretty complex to find how to get in
[0:30:32] <Reizie_Etherealm> Climb to the top of the mountain, your quest is there
[0:30:51] <NeoCre> This is unrelated
[0:30:52] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> @jorniev the glider is at the air bender nomad temple
[0:31:00] <+seduwu> The gate is required for this one
[0:31:09] <DesertPenguin> Now you're just "generic action man"
[0:31:11] <%jiggy_snipe> sbfpSandbag
[0:31:11] <Reizie_Etherealm> No, the heavenly strike quest is up that mountain too
[0:31:15] <T_Sasquatch> Sandbag No Jutsu
[0:31:16] <+pedrothecruel> car crash
[0:31:26] <NeoCre> Huh, interesting
[0:31:37] <theCoolChild> FF7r load squeeze says hello
[0:31:39] <+Jasuchin> They actually slowed the loading apparently so you could read the tips
[0:31:44] <ELFucilaNeroIV> This game is so well optimized that they slowed the loading yeah
[0:31:51] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> BAMBOO BBY
[0:32:02] <alexandrecau> Hell you can'T even read the tip because they load too fast
[0:32:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> I didn't think loading too fast would be a problem until this game LUL
[0:32:13] <%WutangchickeN> Assassins creed
[0:32:26] <dinnydanny777> You mean the jumping actually feels like jumping?
[0:32:33] <Reizie_Etherealm> A lot of pain
[0:32:34] <dinnydanny777> And not holding down a jump button?
[0:32:42] <theCoolChild> Wait they did? I thought it was interesting i could read tips now
[0:32:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[0:32:44] <jorniev> feels more like uncharted jumps
[0:32:47] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> when i see characters climbing the pure FINGER strength they must have
[0:32:53] <+evbites> go right
[0:32:54] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> its insane
[0:33:02] <+Caped_Eggy> Dam, was the miko trying to do these jumps?
[0:33:04] <alexandrecau> white flowers
[0:33:07] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> oooooo
[0:33:21] <Reizie_Etherealm> And the scratches they must endure on the fingers alone due to the body weight crushing down on them against the ledges, yikes
[0:33:23] <jorniev> so there were watch towers from FAR CRY 4
[0:33:29] <+TheDandyGuy> isnt kagutshi the name of a magatama in SMT3 Nocturne
[0:33:32] <+Cyoctane> Fast travel in this game on PS5 is basically going to be teleporting
[0:33:35] <%doomerskeletor13> And you can just pop over to the tree breebuPog
[0:33:38] <@Menitta> Mission Impossible 2 style
[0:33:43] <DSD24> @TheDandyGuy Yes it is!
[0:34:16] <NeoCre> All player characters have indestructible joints and godlike climbing endurance. It’s the law
[0:34:17] <+TheDandyGuy> interesting
[0:34:43] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> I tried mountain climbing training, I made like it halfway up and gave up
[0:35:01] <alexandrecau> you can fast tavel down
[0:35:01] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> it works on muscles that you barely ever strain
[0:35:06] <%chiazam> There's an auto down
[0:35:07] <T_Sasquatch> Is there any game with good climbing honestly
[0:35:14] <+thackattack00> BOTW
[0:35:18] <DesertPenguin> NOT POSSIBLE
[0:35:23] <DesertPenguin> Broken wrists lol
[0:35:23] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> BOTW has good climbing
[0:35:24] <+TheDandyGuy> if mountain climbing was an olympic sport nathan drake would be the words #1 gold medalist
[0:35:42] <DesertPenguin> Nathan Drake, Lara Croft, etfc.
[0:35:43] <DSD24> All the flowers
[0:35:50] <alexandrecau> Everything is connected
[0:35:52] <dinnydanny777> BOTW climbing is kind of dumb, Link can climb sheer cliffs backwards
[0:36:01] <+thackattack00> yeah thats what makes it good
[0:36:07] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> alleast he gets tired doing it
[0:36:09] <DesertPenguin> What do you mean by backwards?
[0:36:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> The duality of man with those two comments LUL
[0:36:23] <%chiazam> HORSE
[0:36:25] <alexandrecau> call aggro
[0:36:28] <dinnydanny777> That he can climb cliffs diagonally

[0:46:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> Fun fact: before you honor the shrine there is one fox on the right side of the shrine, after you honor it there'll be one more on the left side
[0:46:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> If a wild fox ever gets close to you, it is probably rabid, unless it's a longterm taming thing where they get used to you.

[0:50:32] <alexandrecau> @KR_Black he is on water stance
[0:50:32] <%CptnCampy61> Woolie’s footwork is incredible

[0:58:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> NOOOOOOOOO YOU MUST KILL THEM HONORABLY. Haha invaders go boom
[0:58:26] <Brutalyte616> @woolieversus So you can actually do this to the Mongol warlords; if you watch them training, you can actually earn a pip towards your next stance, in addition to the one you get for killing them. So stealth and observation is encouraged for min-maxing.

[1:03:52] <SatoruMasamune> It is literally a hat made of straw, Woolie.
[1:03:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> will the Kamikaze be in this game
[1:03:56] <+Cyoctane> The straw hats with moss on them are the best
[1:04:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> JEBAITED
[1:04:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Jebaited
[1:04:09] <T_Sasquatch> The game really makes strawhats the biggest badasses

[1:04:27] <+seduwu> Yohoho he took a bite of gum gum
[1:04:27] <%gnoame> He turned the markers on
[1:04:30] <%doomerskeletor13> @sjay449 It’s in options
[1:04:30] <Bakefowl> Watch the feet to never get feinted
[1:04:32] <VidulaSaix> Is.... Woolie playing on easy? Ive never seen those markers
[1:04:35] <ZippyPsycho> @sjay449 Accessibility menu
[1:04:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> The straw hat ronins are the slickest swordsmen in this game
[1:04:41] <Djinnazz> you got got!
[1:04:41] <+SinisterBroccoli> didn't know that was an option
[1:04:48] <flame_of_udun_> I think this is normal
[1:04:49] <Zehdre> There's an option in acessibility to see where arrows will come from.
[1:04:51] <%doomerskeletor13> The arrow indicators are in the options menu
[1:04:53] <T_Sasquatch> @vidulasaix optional projectile indicator
[1:04:54] <+evbites> straw hats are bitches
[1:04:55] <Monkeyweed21> is Woolie playing journalist mode?
[1:04:56] <+hotrockcandy> I may need that. I have trouble seeing. but i love the game.
[1:05:03] <%thechungiestofbois> I guess it works, since he is focusing on LPing and Minh and Reggie.
[1:05:05] <thesickestzak> Woolie caught ResidentSleeper
[1:05:18] <SatoruMasamune> I want to say that I'm surprised over Woolie jumping the gun in a way that can only be called Liam-esque, but I'm super not surprised.
[1:05:20] <DesertPenguin> It's harder because the timing is shit
[1:05:36] <DSD24> @SatoruMasamune To be fair this game encourages gun jumping
[1:05:49] <jorniev> its like walking slow with weights
[1:05:51] <+Razputin217> Breakneck Speed
[1:05:58] <alexandrecau> gun jump is honorable
[1:06:07] <%M3djedx> what did he name his horse ?
[1:06:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Kage
[1:06:17] <flame_of_udun_> Uncle approves of gun jumping
[1:06:19] <%M3djedx> love it
[1:06:19] <%chiazam> It's so strange that he hasn't run into a single merchant

[1:06:32] <jorniev> he RE 4s it
[1:06:43] <medril07> when I see this game all I hear is Hanzo's voice
[1:06:47] <PettyFunk> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh I got annoyed when I first started because I couldn't find an armorer for the life of me, I put off getting to Golden Temple
[1:06:50] <%BisoromiBear> he wanted to write ASS on the leaderboard
[1:06:53] <SatoruMasamune> @DSD24 Which is why Woolie os perfect for streaming this game more than any other.
[1:06:55] <jorniev> jump out a window!?

[1:07:21] <%chiazam> DEER ARE SACRED
[1:07:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the phrase it's just a game...
[1:07:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> In fact it's not just ok you're SUPPOSED to be mad
[1:07:37] <%chiazam> NOOOOOOOOOO\
[1:07:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Don’t kill magic animals, Freya will be upset
[1:07:39] <PettyFunk> There's literally a tutorial prompt saying deer are precious and you shouldn't kill them :(
[1:07:41] <Midnight188> that deer is all of Disney. KILL IT.
[1:07:45] <%BisoromiBear> "if you don't rage at games you're a loser" - Ninja
[1:07:49] <Reizie_Etherealm> If you're not mad then you're a loser

[1:07:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:08:02] <%Irridium> just the sweet satisfaction of slaughtering a sacred animal
[1:08:05] <flame_of_udun_> Killing deer gives you nothing but regret
[1:08:05] <%thechungiestofbois> commit as many hate crimes on pigs and bears though
[1:08:08] <jorniev> LP FUNSIES
[1:08:11] <TheSaltminer> I just had a ghastly realisation. Woolie, you're not a filthy HABS fan are you?

[1:08:48] <PettyFunk> @SinisterBroccoli I don't mind the falcon one, but the Tiger King scabbard is pretty goofy
[1:08:51] <TheSaltminer> @SinisterBroccoli "silly" is a strange way of spelling BOSS AS FUCK
[1:08:59] <%chiazam> This quest is sick

[1:13:29] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s trying out the English because he misses subtitles while playing sometimes
[1:13:31] <LeBlanc233> Clap
[1:13:31] <%Irridium> this game never stops being fucking gorgeous
[1:13:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> SICK
[1:13:37] <MonsieurHonHon> Makes sense
[1:13:45] <flame_of_udun_> POG
[1:13:47] <%chiazam> STANCE
[1:13:48] <T_Sasquatch> Loooooool
[1:13:48] <DesertPenguin> Game is serisouly having to tell you lol
[1:13:51] <PettyFunk> It'll keep doing that
[1:13:59] <DesertPenguin> Wow so many tips
[1:14:00] <Zehdre> Backseaty game LUL
[1:14:09] <T_Sasquatch> Hope you enjoy the game literally forcing you to change stance
[1:14:12] <flame_of_udun_> Yeah I hope they patch that out
[1:14:13] <KidKaiser23> Jin: I’m Finna Stance On these hoes
[1:14:15] <PettyFunk> I still got stance reminders well into act 2
[1:14:15] <+Arkfyre> learn to stance switch to not get those messages
[1:14:17] <%doomerskeletor13> The heavenly strike will scare enemies sometimes, it’s hilarious when they try to run
[1:14:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Game thinks people playing it are dumb wow
[1:14:18] <jorniev> SICK DOGE
[1:14:26] <+Cyoctane> Woolie is going to get that stance tip a lot I fear
[1:14:44] <T_Sasquatch> @arkfyre fuck that, i play how i want
[1:14:47] <dinnydanny777> Yeah don't hold it, you need a quick release
[1:14:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> That twirling swing is the hardest to dodge for me
[1:14:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:14:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Less of a tip and more forcing you to switch
[1:15:05] <medril07> ha
[1:15:06] <T_Sasquatch> I beat most duels in the game with water stance only
[1:15:12] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s weird I hardly ever got those tips
[1:15:16] <+SinisterBroccoli> water is the best
[1:15:24] <medril07> too busy finding the one piec
[1:15:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah I usually default to water stance
[1:15:30] <alexandrecau> we"ll eat you
[1:15:31] <%chiazam> fooooooood
[1:15:31] <+SinisterBroccoli> those tips can get annoying
[1:15:31] <Overloard> top 10 moments before disaster in Anime
[1:15:34] <PettyFunk> Water is definitely the most fun, doing the charge move into the flurry is really satisfying
[1:15:42] <Hammatime8> Loot them corpses!
[1:15:44] <flame_of_udun_> Water stance combo game strong
[1:15:45] <+seduwu> Stance switching is good pls dont forget it
[1:15:45] <%chiazam> Yeah I wish you could turn tips off
[1:15:49] <DSD24> I like Wind cause of the charge attack
[1:15:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> NO GAMER
[1:15:51] <Monkeyweed21> Jin only eats honor
[1:15:51] <T_Sasquatch> Flurry works on EVERYONE
[1:15:51] <%Foopoof> @pettyfunk It really is
[1:15:51] <alexandrecau> wind is my favorite because of tje kick
[1:15:52] <%doomerskeletor13> @pettyfunk It’s my favorite move, it’s cleans house
[1:15:57] <+Arkfyre> @T_Sasquatch ifyou want to play shittily and badly that's up to you, but that's not the intended way to play the game
[1:16:05] <%BisoromiBear> you sonuvabitch
[1:16:05] <medril07> mean then nice
[1:16:13] <jorniev> DYLON
[1:16:20] <DSD24> That it is in Jupiter Ascending
[1:16:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's THE BEST

[1:16:30] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s the Han/Lando dynamic
[1:16:32] <%Double_Tap_That> Don't forget communication via muscles.
[1:16:32] <+JustToWatch> that compilation would be 50 hours long
[1:16:35] <+SinisterBroccoli> Oh yeah wind stance seems the most universally useful
[1:16:38] <+Jasuchin> I love those moments

[1:16:48] <%chiazam> You're the only person that can call me fat and live
[1:16:53] <Ner234> Tournament Acr?
[1:16:57] <Pyrrhus90> Bobby B BibleThump
[1:17:02] <Rixstarian> Water stance is great for overwhelming
[1:17:02] <PettyFunk> For the harder duels, the appropriate stance is pretty necessary because you'll hardly get the chance to do many long attack strings.
[1:17:02] <Midnight188> the ol ride n talk. very aaa.
[1:17:19] <flame_of_udun_> @midnight188 you can go as fast as you want in this
[1:17:23] <%chiazam> You CAN gallop
[1:17:25] <T_Sasquatch> @arkfyre ok and ? I dont give a damn. Why should the game force me to change stance. You literally cannot progress without changing your stance
[1:17:30] <%jiggy_snipe> ride and talk, walk and talk, talk and talk Kappa

[1:18:13] <DeebzNutz100> no man's sky it's true. except for the sun
[1:18:13] <Rixstarian> @t_sasquatch BabyRage How dare I adapt to game mechanics?
[1:18:17] <KidKaiser23> God C-
[1:18:17] <%chiazam> They weren't lying in BOTW holy shit
[1:18:21] <jorniev> what was that movie with the thief that looks like the shogun?
[1:18:26] <%doomerskeletor13> They said that for RDR2 and it turned out to be true in that case though
[1:18:33] <%Irridium> jump onto him balls-first
[1:18:34] <Ner234> Not the Rice!
[1:18:38] <Prevot> oh no not the rice
[1:18:41] <KidKaiser23> Maaannn it’s less fun when it’s true
[1:18:43] <SpaceGuntank> not the rice! D:
[1:18:44] <+Arkfyre> @T_Sasquatch because that's the way the game is designed? You're supposed to cantantly stance switch to counter the enemy you're fighting. I don't know what else to tell you, my guy.
[1:18:50] <DSD24> I mean its so pretty though
[1:18:56] <+TheDandyGuy> is that a... rising sun?
[1:19:01] <flame_of_udun_> Rice thieves have no honor
[1:19:02] <KidKaiser23> Nah losing Rice in this period is pretty fuckin rough
[1:19:10] <T_Sasquatch> @rixstarian dude are you stupid ? You can beat the entire game with any STANCE . It should not force you to switch
[1:19:12] <Rixstarian> @arkfyre He's being a DSP. No need to take him seriously
[1:19:15] <DeebzNutz100> in The Crew it's true
[1:19:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Don’t steal my rice you bitches breebuGun
[1:19:22] <jorniev> UNLIMITED SAKE
[1:19:35] <PettyFunk> Rice was literally currency when people were hungry
[1:19:36] <medril07> uhoh
[1:19:57] <Rixstarian> @t_sasquatch Dude are you stupid? Way to project what I said. You're just whining about dumb shit
[1:19:57] <T_Sasquatch> @arkfyre dude. There's nothing defendable about forcing players to switch stances or they can't progress
[1:20:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> STRAW HATS FOR LYFE
[1:20:13] <DSD24> Straw Hat bois
[1:20:14] <medril07> the samurai is food

[1:21:40] <T_Sasquatch> @rixstarian you're saying i can't adapt when I'm saying it shouldn't completely freeze the game to force you to switch but whatever man I'm done talking about it
[1:21:42] <flame_of_udun_> He gives you the shittiest hat possible it’s amazing

[1:22:36] <%BisoromiBear> Mandalore's Straw Hat
[1:22:37] <Dakuu75> You HAVE to look shitier than the boss, that's how it workd

[1:22:42] <+seduwu> look at the upgrades
[1:22:43] <%Double_Tap_That> Upgrade your hat to flex on your friend.

[1:22:44] <%jinking79> Till u upgrade it
[1:22:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> Wandering swordsmen
[1:22:50] <dinnydanny777> Live and die by the bow and the blade
[1:22:50] <alexandrecau> Ronin armor and samurai helmet is great
[1:22:50] <DeebzNutz100> Ronin Warriors
[1:22:53] <+Jasuchin> It is a pretty nice outfit tho
[1:22:54] <%Irridium> no one to mamoru

[1:23:11] <T_Sasquatch> Can you imagine a samurai jack game like ghost of tsuhima ??
[1:23:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Remember when Tom Cruise was the Last Samurai
[1:23:13] <flame_of_udun_> Samurai Jack PogChamp
[1:23:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus upgraded ronin is FUCKING RAD
[1:23:20] <flame_of_udun_> Just need white dye
[1:23:21] <T_Sasquatch> Kreygasm
[1:23:23] <VidulaSaix> Gotta be at shop
[1:23:26] <alexandrecau> Fun fact Ryuzo is actually a kenshin but ronoin sounds cooler
[1:23:29] <DeebzNutz100> When's Highlander BR?
[1:23:30] <PettyFunk> All of the other armor changes in appearance, but the Ronin armor doesn't, Woolie
[1:23:42] <PettyFunk> You can unlock rad dyes for it though
[1:23:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this is like the only armor that only upgrades the hat, and idk why hats never appear
[1:23:49] <Afterman_> @pettyfunk that is false
[1:23:55] <%chiazam> 2
[1:24:06] <alexandrecau> you can have both
[1:24:07] <%chiazam> SPEAR AND SWORD
[1:24:08] <+thackattack00> you can buy both
[1:24:10] <Afterman_> Ronin does change, the hat
[1:24:10] <+seduwu> Woolie pls get the roll it helps a lot
[1:24:12] <%Irridium> I mean, you could buy both
[1:24:14] <Archmortal> regen is totally overrated in that tree
[1:24:18] <flame_of_udun_> All the parry moves are BIG useful
[1:24:20] <DSD24> Man all the no evasion moves are killing me
[1:24:26] <KidKaiser23> Por que No Dos
[1:24:26] <Djinnazz> yes you do.
[1:24:29] <VidulaSaix> You will eventuially
[1:24:29] <+Jasuchin> Wind of Vanity is very good
[1:24:31] <%Irridium> it turns the red ones blue
[1:24:31] <VidulaSaix> A LOT
[1:24:34] <+thackattack00> it turns the red attacks blue
[1:24:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> Because you don't have it, that's why it's red
[1:24:38] <DeebzNutz100> that changes
[1:24:38] <+arancet> this skill makes spear red glints blue
[1:24:39] <Monkeyweed21> it turns red attacks into blue
[1:24:41] <+nanaki_ff14> It turns from Red to Blue!
[1:24:42] <PettyFunk> @Afterman_ Ah. right. Well it unlocks different hats, but the armor itself doesn't change
[1:24:43] <0nett> Changes red to blue
[1:24:44] <%vVAstrAVv> reds become blue
[1:24:45] <DSD24> The Shoulder Tackle is such a good move
[1:24:46] <%chiazam> YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK IT
[1:24:47] <+DarkNerdShawny> You dont see blue until you get that
[1:24:47] <alexandrecau> Yes that'S the thing it turns the spear in all red
[1:24:47] <+thackattack00> @WoolieVersus the skill turns the red attacks blue
[1:24:48] <Equirah> you don't see them cause they're all red
[1:24:50] <+nanaki_ff14> Changes once you unlock it
[1:24:51] <Hammatime8> They're only red because you don't have the upgrade, maybe?
[1:24:53] <T_Sasquatch> Personally the perfect dodge is lame. Not enough damage
[1:24:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> all spear attacks become parryable
[1:24:56] <%Double_Tap_That> You have to unlock the skill to get blue indicators
[1:24:56] <Afterman_> roll is good
[1:24:58] <+TheDandyGuy> I mean rolling seems important
[1:24:58] <Railgun5> @WoolieVersus Buying the spear/sword parry abilities turns the red attacks blue
[1:24:59] <dots4eyes> Do it...you like parries
[1:25:00] <%chiazam> BLUE IS AN UNLOCK
[1:25:07] <VidulaSaix> That turns them blue
[1:25:12] <%vVAstrAVv> red bexomes blue please god get the parry
[1:25:13] <Monkeyweed21> it makes them blue instead of red
[1:25:14] <+arancet> skill makes the reds turn blue
[1:25:14] <+nanaki_ff14> It turns them blue!
[1:25:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it lets you parry spears in general
[1:25:15] <VidulaSaix> It turns RED into BLUE
[1:25:16] <PettyFunk> You'll be able to parry em all !
[1:25:18] <flame_of_udun_> Chats freakin out LUL
[1:25:18] <+Jasuchin> This turns red to blue
[1:25:18] <Equirah> It *makes* them blue @WoolieVersus

[1:25:45] <%Solidnick18> yeah the right side is very good
[1:25:49] <PettyFunk> Spearmen are now targetabel
[1:26:03] <Archmortal> the sword one is much less useful than the spear one
[1:26:04] <+seduwu> woolie will never roll :(
[1:26:13] <%Double_Tap_That> You got the Nakiri counter
[1:26:14] <%Solidnick18> it's parry all unblockable
[1:26:18] <%Solidnick18> yes
[1:26:21] <KidKaiser23> “Spearmen across the Land feel a bone-chilling shift in the Meta”
[1:26:23] <+Jasuchin> Brutes and shield bashes STAY red tho
[1:26:29] <alexandrecau> roll get your clothes covered in mud and SHAME

[1:26:55] <+seduwu> Mud is epic
[1:27:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> The mythic tales musician guy sounds amazing in JP
[1:27:48] <+Jasuchin> Jape
[1:27:49] <+thackattack00> He doesnt have another hat yet
[1:27:50] <DSD24> You gotta upgrade it Minh

[1:29:16] <alexandrecau> 10 hour minh
[1:29:17] <+seduwu> Merchants don’t upgrade lol
[1:29:20] <Afterman_> every armor changes in appearance as you upgrade them. there is an armorer at Golden temple
[1:29:27] <Reizie_Etherealm> Not a merchant, you need an armorer to upgrade
[1:29:28] <alexandrecau> no it won'T
[1:29:30] <HeavyC4> you need armourers and swordsmith to upgrade
[1:29:34] <T_Sasquatch> Armorer at golden temple
[1:29:37] <+arancet> folden temple has every upgrade npc
[1:29:39] <tattleworm> ??????
[1:29:39] <TheSaltminer> The Merchant sells seperate extra hats

[1:29:55] <KidKaiser23> Golden Temple for Better Drip
[1:29:57] <Reizie_Etherealm> See the biggest inconvenience in the early game is that the merchant and the armorer is not in the same area
[1:30:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Your first survivor camp will give a new armor set that is clothes with exploration bonuses.
[1:30:07] <NeoCre> Golden temple for better hat
[1:30:11] <PettyFunk> Has Woolie experienced the joy of the instant transmission fast travel loading times yet?

[1:31:10] <DSD24> Shinsengumi DAH
[1:31:16] <HeavyC4> mushashi killed over 80 people with no armour
[1:31:19] <Afterman_> ronin dye has a style like that I think
[1:31:21] <PettyFunk> Woolie the shinsengumi didn't exist until six centuries after this time period
[1:31:22] <Hammatime8> These streams are making me think about this game
[1:31:32] <Reizie_Etherealm> Shinsengumi sounds way later than this time period
[1:31:41] <+seduwu> Reggie predicts the future
[1:31:48] <TheSaltminer> Reggie predicting th future
[1:31:53] <Hammatime8> You unironically give us a sly cooper skin
[1:31:58] <VidulaSaix> Dont worry you'll get there
[1:31:59] <%SirGO0SE> dang woolie got the guns out ladies keep it together
[1:32:04] <Hammatime8> *yo
[1:32:05] <+seduwu> sly cooper sword
[1:32:13] <+seduwu> second son headband
[1:32:24] <DSD24> Its a good look
[1:32:26] <flame_of_udun_> I wish there was a Cooper cane skin for your katana lol
[1:32:35] <+Jasuchin> That long moon Masamune Date helmet, or Takeda mask?
[1:32:36] <DatAsuna> The yukimura look
[1:32:39] <+seduwu> that would be sick
[1:32:42] <Hammatime8> Please sucker punch, give us the BIGGEST, DUMBEST crossover stuff you got
[1:32:55] <jorniev> the Yojimbo suit
[1:32:59] <VidulaSaix> Theres a TON you can go off stream but you dont NEED to unlike Death Stranding
[1:33:08] <VidulaSaix> You can mainline fairly hard
[1:33:10] <SomersaultJustice> gotta get that vtuber merch ready for the debut
[1:33:14] <Hammatime8> I want that Delsin beanie in my samurai game
[1:33:31] <%koolaid_kevster> I LLOVE YOU WOOLIE!
[1:33:40] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s a lot you can do offscreen
[1:34:06] <Afterman_> just save all named npc quests for stream!
[1:34:12] <+thackattack00> This game doesn't require the Death Stranding grind fortunately
[1:34:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> honestly all the collectibles and stuff isn't super important
[1:34:14] <+Cyoctane> You get a headband based off Delsin's beanie
[1:34:27] <Hammatime8> It's a live hose Kappa
[1:34:31] <Hammatime8> *horse
[1:34:37] <VidulaSaix> I didnt even know there was a slide till just now
[1:34:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The collectibles are straight fun to collect and there is no farming
[1:34:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> @Hammatime8 Sorry to disappoint you but they did implement an easter egg to infamous, it's not a beanie but a Delsin style headband
[1:34:39] <VidulaSaix> Thanks random chatter
[1:34:51] <%Solidnick18> yeah their is a slide
[1:34:53] <Hammatime8> @Reizie_Etherealm Ehhhh, close enough
[1:34:57] <%eyezehuhh> techhhhhhh
[1:34:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Omg, that random slow run was invisible stamina
[1:34:59] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s a good tip
[1:35:34] <DatAsuna> In yakuza the mikiri counter equiv is juts a knee to the stomach
[1:35:36] <+Arkfyre> you can also just press dodge once when you're winded and it will reset your stamina
[1:35:56] <+seduwu> The roll helps with stamina cancels
[1:35:58] <VidulaSaix> WHY
[1:35:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> If you roll once your run stamina also resets, but woolie hasn't unlocked the roll yet
[1:36:00] <%jiggy_snipe> Kappa

[1:36:10] <Hammatime8> HOW
[1:36:15] <%Solidnick18> this is cursed
[1:36:16] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @DesertPenguin
[1:36:17] <+DarkNerdShawny> The comment gets worst as you read it
[1:36:19] <Prevot> MGS4 played you
[1:36:21] <@Menitta> you did not play the video game.
[1:36:22] <thesickestzak> LUL
[1:36:26] <@Menitta> that is accurate
[1:36:35] <dinnydanny777> Hey, listen MSG 4, has some nice butts in it
[1:36:38] <T_Sasquatch> You thought you did. But you didn't
[1:36:44] <Drusain> Imagine seeing Meryl in MGS4 and going "who?"
[1:36:54] <Javipuff> The game plays you
[1:36:56] <@Menitta> yeah that was a flex
[1:37:21] <%Solidnick18> can't wait to see what ichiban is about
[1:37:28] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly i dont think it's a big deal imo
[1:37:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I'm too busy reading to look at their lips lol
[1:37:34] <+FackinCrazy> Honestly even the english lip sync is pretty bad
[1:37:35] <DSD24> I like hearing things in English
[1:37:42] <VidulaSaix> Its because theres a lot of dialogue at all times so you will constantly miss things becuase you need to focus on the game
[1:37:53] <%jiggy_snipe> the lip sync would be a problem if it was in English
[1:37:53] <+seduwu> speed racer dub levels
[1:37:56] <+Cyoctane> But if I'm reading subtitles why do I care about lip sync?
[1:37:57] <+Solutha> its the biggest weeb game and yet they made the lip sync english is what bother me
[1:38:00] <%jiggy_snipe> cuz you would notice it more
[1:38:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm looking at the back of the guys head during the dialog for gods sake
[1:38:10] <xbb1024> watching passively requires more of that visual detail
[1:38:11] <%Solidnick18> i'm mostly reading the subs most the time
[1:38:12] <DesertPenguin> Wow, I got timed out for using all caps twice in the course of an hour and it said "excessive use of caps" LUL
[1:38:12] <dinnydanny777> I like the anime where they have Japanese actors pretending to be English
[1:38:16] <dinnydanny777> It's so bad
[1:38:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Japan loves the game anyways so it doesn’t really matter
[1:38:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> AND I HAVE A MASK ON
[1:38:33] <+seduwu> @solutha it was mocapped in english
[1:38:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> @DesertPenguin Replace the capital I with a small case l
[1:39:02] <+Solutha> So? they could do both as stated other games do
[1:39:26] <PettyFunk> Yeah no need to sweep the map, you get a poof and see undiscovered ? marks
[1:39:33] <%Solidnick18> also if you dicover a question mark you can just warp back to it and do it later.
[1:39:38] <+seduwu> but english tho
[1:39:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Spider Man had the towers yeah
[1:39:49] <DesertPenguin> That confirms Woolie has already played Spider-Man PS4 so he's not gonna LP it
[1:40:07] <%doomerskeletor13> I asked if they would LP it once and he said he’d already played it
[1:40:13] <uncledoodsauce> mingh you're wrong
[1:40:13] <DesertPenguin> Werd
[1:40:15] <PettyFunk> There are a TON
[1:40:20] <%Solidnick18> you wanna do the mythics and the sidequests
[1:40:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there isn't that many
[1:40:20] <VidulaSaix> Theres a LOOOOOOT
[1:40:26] <DesertPenguin> One day we'll get the Arkham games
[1:40:26] <VidulaSaix> This game is decepitvely huge
[1:40:27] <Afterman_> save all named npc quests for stream
[1:40:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they're short too
[1:40:34] <%Solidnick18> There's a fuckton
[1:40:37] <%vVAstrAVv> let him do thw white diamond ones
[1:40:38] <%doomerskeletor13> There are a lot but most are short
[1:40:39] <%Solidnick18> alot alot alot
[1:40:39] <+arancet> yes do those off screen
[1:40:47] <VidulaSaix> The only ones you need to focus on on screen are the ones with faces, blue quests and goold quests @WoolieVersus
[1:40:54] <%doomerskeletor13> The white ones are for offscreen yeah
[1:40:54] <+seduwu> do those off screen and do all the other ones on stream
[1:41:00] <%bread_assassin> Mihn's wrong. As long as they're not attached to a major character, ya can off-screen them.
[1:41:02] <PettyFunk> Save your companion quests for streams but there are DOZENS AND DOZENS of the unnamed NPC quests
[1:41:04] <%Solidnick18> yeah do those on screen
[1:41:06] <Afterman_> @woolieversus any quest from a named character should be done on stream. all random npc quests are fine to do off
[1:41:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They put a lot of effort into the side content, most of it is just about as good as the main progression
[1:41:23] <VidulaSaix> The faceless ones are worth doing is what Minh means, and he's right, but you can do those off screen
[1:41:25] <%vVAstrAVv> record them cus a few are good but dont bother saving them for the lp
[1:41:25] <%Solidnick18> the faceless ones are mostly the same
[1:41:31] <+DarkNerdShawny> They kinda are brainless missions tbh
[1:41:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's ok for Woolie to enjoy by himself, we don't need to see it
[1:41:32] <PettyFunk> They're tiny little sidestories, they can be interesting but they would take a huge amount of time
[1:41:35] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> those are unamed quests are usually GO here investigate, kill mongols, finish mission
[1:41:37] <+Cyoctane> Do the ghost forest one onscreen
[1:41:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> well let's see how he feels once he does a few so he gets a feel for how major or minor they are
[1:41:46] <%doomerskeletor13> The smaller white ones are for off stream yeah
[1:41:48] <%Solidnick18> they are just side stories you can do later
[1:42:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They're super not filler trash
[1:42:13] <%FenixSeraph> LUIGI 24/01
