[0:05:58] <%QueequegTheater> @woolieversus The actual answer is the sections of your brain that govern feet and sex organs are located directly next to each other, so confusion occurs for some people
[0:06:00] <simulationbard> I've heard it's because the part of the brain that recognizes genitals is right next to the part that recognizes feet and sometimes wires get crossed

[0:23:37] <socratetris> lol
[0:23:39] <+dukenux> sbfpWelcome sbfpKoopy
[0:23:39] <marvel877> Did Woolie play catch up to remember what was going on in the game?
[0:23:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> cool. I'm 40 mins late and still on time. sweet
[0:23:40] <$trueherobappo> Yo
[0:23:41] <happyface699> The story is a incoherent mess
[0:23:43] <socratetris> TY! Will do!
[0:23:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> I hope the modders get on it
[0:23:45] <%wumpa45> wumpa45 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[0:23:53] <happyface699> but the gameplay is a plus
[0:23:55] <+kiiiirsten> @Sphincter_Spelunker LUL Go ahead and pee, grab a snack, no rush
[0:23:55] <%GraceTBM> I was so fake hyped for Lady that I'm pretty bummed about DMC now
[0:23:56] <thepiefoot> I believe them if they say that there is no dlc coming, REmake didn't even got that much dlc
[0:24:01] <hassanico> "Randomizer mode though"
[0:24:06] <Dragon_Batman> That makes sense
[0:24:08] <+thesw1tch> @sidboytm you fool. run!
[0:24:09] <%QueequegTheater> Poor Lucia
[0:24:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dragon's Dogma 2, baby!
[0:24:10] <gustavozxd> yeah capcom said the first row of re2 dlc and nothing yet
[0:24:13] <+bread_assassin> Give me Dragon's Dogma 2.
[0:24:16] <+nharliecash> hopefully the RE2 team has moved onto RE3 make
[0:24:18] <radregice> i prefer new (good) content
[0:24:18] <+ThatGuyfromMars> golly the one time I want Capcom to milk the fuck out REmake 2 and they deny me
[0:24:18] <zecht89> yea that's preferable too
[0:24:20] <insaneintentionsyo> yo
[0:24:20] <bigbradish> Thats so odd to me considering all the money those games made
[0:24:23] <moogle_dood> It was canceled because they‚Äôre making DmC 2 instead.
[0:24:24] <jorgeniev> DRAGONS DOG MA IS COMIN
[0:24:27] <thetruenicster> didnt okabe say in an interview in February that there would be more dlc?
[0:24:28] <%Raiden_Breaker> compared to re7 they didn't do much but it was great that it was free
[0:24:28] <$trueherobappo> @thesw1tch WHERE TO?!
[0:24:32] <rytisone> RE2 dlc is RE3. DMC 5 will have SE in a couple of years
[0:24:32] <Joestar1890> DMC Revengance!
[0:24:34] <%TheNewJapanGuy> DMCV Special Edition is "probably happen" eventually anyway, maybe
[0:24:34] <+ThatGuyfromMars> that isn't my fetish capcom
[0:24:39] <gustavozxd> @Valentinius_Anodyne that MIGHT be announced next year maybe, but it's not coming in a while for sure
[0:24:40] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus You think that news means anything about a Special edition coming out much later?
[0:24:40] <@Menitta> The Ladies Night of Devil May Cry
[0:24:40] <Dragon_Batman> Yea would be dope
[0:24:42] <%TheNewJapanGuy> will*
[0:24:42] <happyface699> Remake code Veronica so we get campy wesker again
[0:24:44] <Dragon_Batman> either way
[0:24:46] <gustavozxd> GOOD FIGHTING GAME!?
[0:24:47] <alcors_wisdom> i mean lady vergil and trish all have move sets already in the game so modders just need to assign buttons to them and youre pretty much set
[0:24:48] <42nfl19> Would you rather it be a DLC, Expansion, or own thing?
[0:24:50] <@Menitta> Vergil NEEDS to be in 5
[0:24:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> @rytisone Yeah that's probably right
[0:24:58] <%QueequegTheater> DMC6 is a Lady/Lucia/Trish buddy cop adventure
[0:25:02] <gustavozxd> I need a capcom vs capcom like come on
[0:25:03] <+thesw1tch> @sidboytm it's too late! the bus is getting fucked by a dinosaur now... you missed some dumb shit lol
[0:25:04] <%GraceTBM> I think I can respect a special edition
[0:25:04] <thepiefoot> @nharliecash I've read that it's not going to be the same team
[0:25:09] <Archmortal> I would hope capcom has learned how to expand games instead of constant rereleases by now
[0:25:10] <jorgeniev> I BELIVE IN THEM
[0:25:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @QueequegTheater god i want that so bad

[0:28:09] <DrkJP520> thank fuck. i thought we were starting from the beginning
[0:28:11] <$trueherobappo> Correct
[0:28:12] <big_chugnus> Pat is a tyrant
[0:28:14] <+DocFish> pat can you talk about the re novels
[0:28:15] <Dragon_Batman> I imagine he meant the game
[0:28:16] <%TheNewJapanGuy> X GON GIVE IT TO YA (again)
[0:28:16] <%wolfofsound> Listen to this nerd
[0:28:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> x is gonna give it to you.
[0:28:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Mr X is homer
[0:28:20] <$trueherobappo> What was the official name again?
[0:28:20] <thepiefoot> Calling him "the tyrant" would make confusion, i beleive
[0:28:23] <BlkFlameKami> I hear buzzing
[0:28:24] <%QueequegTheater> Is this Crazy Talk Requiem
[0:28:26] <%garbocardboardington> Eh, Whatever
[0:28:27] <$trueherobappo> I know it was like T something
[0:28:30] <marvel877> We can read, Woolie.
[0:28:33] <Brother_Coduss> @nharliecash that's literally all of the 103 series of tyrants though
[0:28:33] <%GraceTBM> t103?
[0:28:35] <+D00msDayDan> the REAL mr x is in ace combat 7
[0:28:35] <thepiefoot> @SidBoyTM IIRC T-100
[0:28:35] <%KineKithZen> You Wa Shot
[0:28:35] <laguerrilha> Callouts PogChamp
[0:28:36] <Joestar1890> Isn't he canonically Mr.X now though?
[0:28:38] <+dawsfloss> does Mr.X have a website?
[0:28:38] <ElenaManetta> what month is it
[0:28:38] <PortableBoredom> Still not in any of the games. Mr. X is a toy.
[0:28:39] <siamzero94> there's like a hundred tyrants though
[0:28:40] <%Mr_Plate_Of_Soup> showlove100 aww beans, are my favorite boys gonna play my favorite game so far of 2019? color me excited! (and maybe green and purple) showlove100
[0:28:43] <ElenaManetta> we're still doing RE2!
[0:28:43] <+mans51> is there a neckbeard mod for mr x yet? ü§î
[0:28:46] <$trueherobappo> @thepiefoot Thanks brother
[0:28:46] <radregice> woolie don't forget to use consumables
[0:28:48] <Greywolf47> when will leon ever get that ada booty?
[0:28:49] <%garbocardboardington> Zoinks, my arm hurts
[0:28:50] <hollowxbear> NOW we continue the bloodline of redfield
[0:28:52] <thetruenicster> ah, the sewers, containing my least favorite enemy
[0:28:53] <SomeDwarf> The original Leon costume has the bandages over his clothes, which I deeply appreciate
[0:28:53] <big_chugnus> That's TIME
[0:28:55] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[0:28:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> ......
[0:29:00] <stabbityrabbit> I can't wait for Mr. X to come to MvC:I with 'X Gon' Give It To Ya' as his theme.
[0:29:00] <Prevot> LUL
[0:29:01] <MarylandJutsu> ADA WAIT
[0:29:03] <%wolfofsound> oh boy chat
[0:29:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> Off to a rollicking good stary
[0:29:05] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> thats a lot of afk time
[0:29:06] <theGhastlyVisage> ayyyyy
[0:29:06] <b1gboss007> LUL
[0:29:09] <FALCONxPAWNCH> Are we past the Ada section?
[0:29:10] <$trueherobappo> I'm about to get big stoned and watch woolie bumble through this game
[0:29:14] <thepiefoot> @SidBoyTM The 100 series is the ones that were succesful, thus were mass produced
[0:29:14] <rytisone> Ada wait
[0:29:15] <crazy_laughter> It's even more terrifying that MR X is juat a jobber with a serial number.
[0:29:20] <b1gboss007> MADE IN HEAVEN -Woolie probably
[0:29:20] <%GraceTBM> I think I missed it, woolie "replayed it up to here" What does that mean?
[0:29:22] <marvel877> 9 and a half hours, we only half way in the sewers.
[0:29:32] <+Th3SmartAlec> Nothing!
[0:29:32] <Dragon_Batman> Yea like an hour of that is like leaving it in the inventory on break
[0:29:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> WHAT'S IN THE BOX?
[0:29:35] <alcors_wisdom> dongle
[0:29:41] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @TeraMercier made a new save file and played up to the point in his original save
[0:29:42] <snakemuho> no healing PogChamp
[0:29:43] <+Fantion> I haven't caught up is this A or B?
[0:29:47] <hypecactuar> Dongles
[0:29:52] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus whats on your shirt?
[0:29:53] <%garbocardboardington> isn't gold time like 7:30:00?
[0:29:53] <thepiefoot> @Fantion Leon A
[0:29:59] <+nharliecash> fun fact: the MAG in MAG ammo stands for maggie simpson
[0:30:02] <+Fantion> @thepiefoot Thanks!
[0:30:03] <happyface699> As Leon will not fuck Clair. Chris now relies on the ustanak from re 6 to tell Jake to fuck chris sister and impregnate her with his superpower wesker seed.
[0:30:05] <DianaTheAscian> @AngriestPat whats on woolies shirt?
[0:30:06] <%GraceTBM> Thanks, Spelunker!
[0:30:08] <@mothmandraws> going for world record
[0:30:08] <Dragon_Batman> Yeaa doood
[0:30:11] <rytisone> rip S+ rank
[0:30:11] <+smuggleruncle> wow not even S+ DansGame
[0:30:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> almost 3 months
[0:30:15] <big_chugnus> Just dont speak at all
[0:30:19] <%topendbuzza> s rank high
[0:30:21] <%wolfofsound> Pat does that anyways
[0:30:22] <$trueherobappo> @thepiefoot So wait, if the 100 series were the successful ones, why aren't there more than one? I feel like a lot of shit would have been done if they just mass dropped like, 50 of them in a given city.
[0:30:23] <crazy_laughter> We love you regardles
[0:30:24] <Gigigear21 > don't use any of that stuff woolie you might need it later
[0:30:26] <dimensaur> I actually just got to the end of the youtube videos last night
[0:30:32] <ElenaManetta> Is there a reason why PAUSE MENU doesn't pause the time? Are the developers like, "Item management should count towards the total"
[0:30:33] <gustavozxd> "eeh i can see that" looks back at the detroit LP LUL
[0:30:39] <valanway_slash> I hate fake pause screens
[0:30:41] <$trueherobappo> Unless they're super hard to control, which I would assume would be a major issue.
[0:30:43] <%QueequegTheater> sucksed
[0:30:48] <MarylandJutsu> LAST TIME, on ADA WAIT
[0:30:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sucks...es...ted
[0:30:51] <SomeDwarf> @SidBoyTM There's an island where they mass produce Mr. X, but I don't think it's canon
[0:30:53] <devanmuse> Does anyone else hear a purring in the background? Did Woolie get a particularly affectionate cat?
[0:30:55] <CalderGaming> @SidBoyTM the thing about the stuff that really works is that it can be expensive and time-consuming to make
[0:31:01] <takokasa> boxzDerp boxzDerp boxzUwU boxzDerp
[0:31:06] <Dragon_Batman> You technically haven't entered the sewers yet
[0:31:09] <simulationbard> I just saw an endgame ad on TV that contacted clips from the CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE. Why do people make trailers like this
[0:31:10] <thepiefoot> @SidBoyTM There IS more "Mr Xsseses". I believe the canon goes that only one Mr X was dropped in the police station
[0:31:12] <+Fantion> Might as well call this whole game an homage
[0:31:14] <%GraceTBM> I got so neurotic for all my first 4 plays of this game to make sure to only ever pause with start, now that I've gotten my speeds down it's still a weird tick I can't remember to stop
[0:31:16] <%garbocardboardington> Leon makes it to the end of the game and comes across a muscular skeleton, a camera, binoculars, and a box of assorted condoms.
[0:31:16] <$trueherobappo> @CalderGaming But umbrella has all the monies
[0:31:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> leon and ada had sex in a sewer?
[0:31:18] <SomeDwarf> In the original RE2 a helicopter with 6 tubes drops one and that's where Mr. X comes from so there ARE more
[0:31:21] <rytisone> oh man, framerate on ps4 is so much worse than on pc
[0:31:21] <gustavozxd> @ElenaManetta yeah that's exactly it actually
[0:31:23] <alcors_wisdom> lol did you guys see that david cage just tweeted that detroit become human changed his life it was so good :omegalul:
[0:31:34] <MarylandJutsu> freakig Cage
[0:31:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> fucking how you get pink eye
[0:31:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh boy
[0:31:38] <HitchhikingThrough> Wait what
[0:31:38] <thepiefoot> @SidBoyTM REUC (? has more Mr. Xeses too
[0:31:42] <$cureneckbeard> oops i made the bad game
[0:31:42] <insaneintentionsyo> terrifying
[0:31:42] <%topendbuzza> oh boy
[0:31:44] <+SolidusRex> Both RE2 and FFVII have some of my favorite pre-rendered backgrounds ever
[0:31:45] <big_chugnus> Poop
[0:31:47] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh COME ON I THOUGHT WE WERE STARTING AT 8
[0:31:48] <SailingSaturn> @simulationbard Because Marketing people are dumb and think people are dumb
[0:31:56] <marvel877> BACK TO WALL HUGGING.
[0:31:57] <$trueherobappo> @thepiefoot That makes sense
[0:32:01] <thepiefoot> @SomeDwarf I beleive that was a RE3 cutscene
[0:32:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> I would rather it be thots
[0:32:04] <%topendbuzza> nah it's fine
[0:32:06] <snakemuho> THOTS
[0:32:10] <CalderGaming> god i still need to play hellblade
[0:32:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> oh fuck, playing pokemon at the same time and ran into a shiny. gonna be a good night, boys
[0:32:12] <+rdark_ksu> .....I talk to myself constantly
[0:32:14] <%GraceTBM> I fucking fucking love expressed personality from my characters instead of generic player
[0:32:14] <DianaTheAscian> @Youwereeatenbyalid dont worry we just started
[0:32:16] <bomi1995> normal people talk to themselves
[0:32:17] <rytisone> thought bubbles appearing
[0:32:17] <MarylandJutsu> @SailingSaturn i mean I only saw earlier trailers and they didn't spoil me at all
[0:32:18] <@Menitta> I would not play Days Gone then lol
[0:32:19] <+mans51> people talk when they're scared
[0:32:21] <alexandrecau> Horror characters should be like cursing or weeping under their breath
[0:32:21] <Dragon_Batman> Remember map screen shows if you collected items or finished puzzles
[0:32:23] <gustavozxd> out loud? yeah it's dumb, would be better if it were like ace attorney
[0:32:23] <NotHereToStream> sometimes its a coping mechanism
[0:32:25] <MarylandJutsu> oh god Days Gone
[0:32:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I talk to myself, sometimes, but I getcha
[0:32:26] <marvel877> LOGIC RUINS NARRATIVES.
[0:32:27] <%garbocardboardington> im fine, as long as its a short thing, not like a damn monolauge
[0:32:31] <Aydarkzero> it happens sometimes
[0:32:31] <insaneintentionsyo> G it sure is quiet
[0:32:31] <Brother_Coduss> @WoolieVersus because some people talk to themselves during times of stress as an attempt at self reassurance
[0:32:31] <%Mighty_observer> BEGONE THOUGHT
[0:32:32] <%GraceTBM> Hearing that echo voice is way more immersion shattering to me
[0:32:33] <crimsonharvest> I talk to myself out loud to manage my panic disorder if im in private
[0:32:34] <morthieus> is the game alittle quite for anyone?
[0:32:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> I narrate to myself all the time.
[0:32:38] <%vexingsruzz> vexingsruzz subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:32:39] <SourceHorse> Woolie wants THOTS only!
[0:32:41] <alcors_wisdom> i mean... is noise really a problem most of the time in RE
[0:32:43] <Dragon_Batman> I do as well
[0:32:43] <snakemuho> just make a Heavy Rain
[0:32:43] <+templar010> Same
[0:32:43] <ItsaMeFlood> I jus finished the true ending (claire as 2nd playthrough) for the first time ever and wow, this isnt the kind of game i normally like, but this is a frigging masterpiece!! Sp glad i decided to get it after all
[0:32:44] <Aydarkzero> same
[0:32:44] <%topendbuzza> all the time
[0:32:45] <DianaTheAscian> same
[0:32:45] <%wolfofsound> I do that alot

[0:32:48] <prime_name> Same
[0:32:48] <CptBritches> Me too
[0:32:48] <%topendbuzza> same
[0:32:48] <%ProfessorDetective052996> As do I.
[0:32:49] <+in_spaaace> Same
[0:32:49] <$trueherobappo> ?
[0:32:49] <thelonechris> Internal thots
[0:32:51] <+TopTieramisu> he's right
[0:32:51] <%topendbuzza> yes
[0:32:52] <SomeDwarf> Also making Mr. X is hard because you need like.. Child brains to make them?
[0:32:52] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[0:32:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> Actually Pat, we;re tricking you
[0:32:53] <%yeknomlive> im doing it right now
[0:32:53] <big_chugnus> Cause of the cholesterol
[0:32:53] <@Menitta> I talk to myself 24/7. Are you saying I am a poor narrative device? Kappa
[0:32:54] <@Solidus_113> I do that
[0:32:54] <thepiefoot> I have vid in the background so i don't need to talk to myself
[0:32:55] <+Mothman742> same
[0:32:55] <%Dr00_PhD> Denger>
[0:32:55] <gkingsausagelink> yea
[0:32:55] <%TheOneUpWarrior> same
[0:32:55] <SailingSaturn> @MarylandJutsu there are new ones, the old ones were careful
[0:32:57] <%ProfessorDetective052996> Reality is Unrealistic.
[0:32:57] <+dukenux> you underestimate the numbers of us crazies, Woolie
[0:32:58] <gustavozxd> denger?
[0:32:58] <CalderGaming> ! LIFE IN DENGER !
[0:32:58] <happyface699> Same woolie
[0:33:00] <CryptusMaximus> That's why I love taking breaks between RE games. Its like a factory reset on your knowledge of the game.
[0:33:00] <alcors_wisdom> its mostly just when lickers are around that talking is an issue
[0:33:00] <+templar010> If I didnt talk to myself I would go crazy
[0:33:01] <$cureneckbeard> WHO'S TALKING
[0:33:02] <+Omegaanimus> Ever narrate someone else's life? Just narrate everything they do
[0:33:03] <%GraceTBM> Well this isn't really a noise intensive situation, Woolie
[0:33:03] <rytisone> its so weird when you get caught
[0:33:04] <ScreamLord> I'm such a dick, and I have to let myself know that.
[0:33:05] <MarylandJutsu> @SailingSaturn ahhh damn for reals? that bites
[0:33:06] <+StooEsq> Pat always lives on the edge
[0:33:06] <+RJay80> PAT AT RISK
[0:33:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> We are never safe from the threat of bodily fluids
[0:33:06] <@mothmandraws> id talk more
[0:33:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> At any moment, Paige will steal his skeleton. He's always in danger.
[0:33:08] <knyttstories> Who DOESN'T talk to themselves?
[0:33:09] <alexandrecau> If your life is in danger SHOUT FOR HELP WOOLIE
[0:33:09] <ElenaManetta> Human reaction is unpredictable. Laughing while in life-threatening situations isn't abnormal.
[0:33:09] <mesamus> RELOAD WOOLIE
[0:33:09] <Dingo_Eejit> !RlSK AT RlSK!
[0:33:11] <@mothmandraws> intimidate the enemy
[0:33:11] <Greywolf47> it's weirder if you don't talk to yourself.
[0:33:13] <$trueherobappo> People who talk to themselves on a daily basis are super smart
[0:33:15] <%Aussie_Manny> CAAAAAAAARL
[0:33:16] <+SolidusRex> CORAL
[0:33:16] <+Justlaxy> I don't know how audio mixing works but inner dialogue, with monsters, and explosions all at once seems hard.
[0:33:17] <%Aussie_Manny> D:
[0:33:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they go, "Metal gear, metal gear."
[0:33:19] <+CJett92> COOOOOORAL!
[0:33:20] <+PenmanLupine> Woolie's doing the thing where he doesn't understand human behavior
[0:33:20] <+dukenux> CORAL
[0:33:21] <uncle_christian> What keeps Leon from puking from the stench?
[0:33:21] <%wolfofsound> CORRAL
[0:33:21] <MarylandJutsu> CARRLLLLLLLL THAT KILLS PEOPLE
[0:33:21] <+Reisadan> oh my god you absolute puff muffin please reload
[0:33:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> CORAL
[0:33:22] <+smuggleruncle> caaaaaaaarl
[0:33:23] <thepiefoot> Carol ?
[0:33:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> why they sneak, sneak, sneak.
[0:33:27] <+Th3SmartAlec> I notice Woolie's improved his room searching skills at the moment
[0:33:27] <BusterRepukken> got is also bad
[0:33:27] <happyface699> CARLLlLlLllLllLllLlllllll
[0:33:28] <ScreamLord> Whisper screaming is the worst
[0:33:29] <dimensaur> I dunno I liked this last season
[0:33:31] <EuropanLamprey> Carl: Yo, what you want Wool-man?
[0:33:31] <CptBritches> We thought you was a toad!
[0:33:31] <%garbocardboardington> Coral@
[0:33:33] <stabbityrabbit> So Woolie never wants to be hiding next to Ryuji, got it.
[0:33:33] <valanway_slash> Leon has to keep himself company
[0:33:33] <%topendbuzza> is woolie human???
[0:33:33] <%zeroarturia> COOOOOOOORRRRRRAAAAALLLLL
[0:33:34] <$trueherobappo> CORAL!!!!!!
[0:33:34] <happyface699> CORALLllllll
[0:33:34] <@Menitta> Again, dont play Days Gone
[0:33:36] <%doomerskeletor13> CARLLLL
[0:33:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's an outer monologue
[0:33:38] <%GraceTBM> What about him talking shit to the zombies? I love them both
[0:33:39] <%yeknomlive> I talk to myself to calm myself too
[0:33:40] <gustavozxd> "a keycard, NICE!"
[0:33:41] <thelonechris> CORAL
[0:33:42] <+CourtInjustice> This last season was actually really good
[0:33:44] <thepiefoot> Fuck off, Woolie. Leon taliing to himself is really cool
[0:33:48] <SomeDwarf> Days Gone has one cool thing
[0:33:48] <CalderGaming> degunk your map, kids
[0:33:50] <crazy_laughter> Stress brings out nervous habits, like talking to yourself
[0:33:50] <zeroraider> are you narrating or is your skeleton flesh pilot narrating...?
[0:33:51] <KZN02> That's so coral
[0:33:54] <R3c0n31> Wolfeinstein version?
[0:33:56] <uncle_christian> Let Woolie learn from his mistakes.
[0:33:56] <+dukenux> The one narrative device in video games i;m tired off is goddamn voicetapes.
[0:33:59] <BusterRepukken> Has anyone read that Games Biz Star Citizen article
[0:34:03] <DianaTheAscian> did days gone come out already?
[0:34:05] <%wolfofsound> He would really like HXH then, all the context and feelings are explained by the narrator
[0:34:06] <@Menitta> Walking Dead is a repeating plot like a fuckin shonen
[0:34:07] <Dragon_Batman> The knoife is back
[0:34:07] <happyface699> It‚Äôs a starfish coral
[0:34:07] <%garbocardboardington> @Menitta its only the first 5 hours that suck, after that its pretty gud
[0:34:08] <MarylandJutsu> @Menitta all i had to see was the protag wearing a backwards cap to his wedding and the line "I want you to ride me like you do you motorcycle"
[0:34:10] <%Itselguapo> The stupid kid in walking dead when they are all walking around and acting like zombies and the one kid says super loudly, "mooooommmmmyyyyyy....."
[0:34:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh god, voice taper recordings
[0:34:11] <+smuggleruncle> also leon has to talk as a king of cringe
[0:34:16] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @dukenux detective vision for me, chief
[0:34:19] <+smuggleruncle> it's his duty
[0:34:22] <alcors_wisdom> @CerberusDriver the one about the game never going to get finished? yea
[0:34:23] <CalderGaming> nice
[0:34:24] <HitchhikingThrough> birken?
[0:34:26] <%ProfessorDetective052996> Nice.
[0:34:29] <%GraceTBM> Yeah, as much as voice tapes are technologically consistent, who the fuck EVER leaves a voice memo. Prolly not that many people
[0:34:29] <Aydarkzero> lucky shot!
[0:34:30] <@Menitta> @MarylandJutsu Shut up, thats not a line
[0:34:30] <Greywolf47> nice
[0:34:32] <@Menitta> No way
[0:34:33] <+RJay80> zombo jukes
[0:34:33] <+dukenux> @Sphincter_Spelunker that atleast serves gameplay
[0:34:34] <thepiefoot> Rucky Shotto
[0:34:35] <BusterRepukken> "Star Citizen development reportedly troubled by mishandled money, micromanagement"
[0:34:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Nice
[0:34:37] <uncle_christian> VHS Tape?
[0:34:37] <Dragon_Batman> Nice first kill of the stream
[0:34:39] <+nharliecash> I prefer audio logs to "echos" and "Ghost memories"
[0:34:40] <hotleaf_juice> Are pat and Woolie aware that the second half of attack on titan season 3 has started
[0:34:40] <MarylandJutsu> @Menitta ITS HER WEEDING VOWS
[0:34:44] <MarylandJutsu> *Wedding

[0:36:26] <HitchhikingThrough> what's an AWP Whore?
[0:36:27] <mastermidget23> It's the youtube rewind so you wont feel bad about the apocalypse.
[0:36:27] <+Fantion> Also leads to some problems with the upkeep. like a door was propped up with a fucking crowbar
[0:36:28] <+TheAutisticCowboy> I'm 23, and still have LOTS of VHS Tapes. I love VHS tapes. Nostalgia is powerful, man. Also, the first HD Home content was produced on VHS, which is NUTS!

[0:36:34] <%Itselguapo> "When it's all over play this" and it's captain america flipping a chair sitting on the chair like, "Soo.... the world has ended, you messed up, but that's ok...."
[0:36:35] <wydamn> Fun fact: 30% of people today who purchase vinyl records don't actually have a record player. We live in a weird time.
[0:36:37] <+ThatGuyfromMars> during the cold war, it's wasn't creepy to think about, it was something that could happen

[0:36:50] <simulationbard> It's CNN and it's a crappy video of a band playing "Nearing My God to Me" aka the song that was reportedly played as the Titanic went down
[0:36:50] <%yeknomlive> what makes that pizza time video the best is the heart thumps
[0:36:50] <uncle_christian> PJSalt Leon
[0:36:51] <Dingo_Eejit> just Chris Morris not saying goodnight, just sayin...

[0:36:54] <+Taglog7> up tit?
[0:36:55] <CalderGaming> @stabbityrabbit i can chime in here and say that one of the more annoying things was adjusting the tracking
[0:36:56] <%topendbuzza> take that w=wall
[0:36:56] <happyface699> People have forgotten ghetto blasters surely
[0:36:56] <gustavozxd> the fact that someone genuinely has safety precautions to THE END OF THE WORLD is pretty scary
[0:36:57] <%GraceTBM> I like that patient confident controlling
[0:36:57] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie became a big boi shoote
[0:36:57] <mastermidget23> @MarylandJutsu You jinxed it immediately!

[0:37:03] <MarylandJutsu> @mastermidget23 IM SORRy
[0:37:03] <$trueherobappo> The woolz gained a level in firearms
[0:37:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> Woolie's been grinding off screen
[0:37:04] <%IDTheftVictim> apatCrazy
[0:37:05] <alcors_wisdom> "in case of end of the world break glass" and its just a microphish with dante saying "whoohoo pizza" for 10 minutes
[0:37:06] <+SolidusRex> I think CNN once said that they planned on broadcasting Nearer My God To Thee" should the world begin to end
[0:37:07] <thepiefoot> @StampyKnowsGaming When i found out that 4:3 VHS tapes were cutting off part of the sides i was bamboozled
[0:37:08] <Zayasu> LUL
[0:37:08] <zajoestar> all that apex practice
[0:37:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> JINX
[0:37:09] <+smuggleruncle> jinxed it
[0:37:10] <%GraceTBM> Seems like Woolie was a lot more comfortable practicing off screen
[0:37:10] <HitchhikingThrough> She talks crazy talk
[0:37:11] <@mothmandraws> its because clearly the delay in this LP was them hiring someone to play the game and they are just talking over
[0:37:12] <%garbocardboardington> "Sheeeeeit" Leon s. Kenedy -1998
[0:37:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't worry, Woolie's just gaming that dynamic difficulty by missing shots
[0:37:14] <+dukenux> Must be all that TF|2
[0:37:14] <%Aussie_Manny> Pat, you ruined it

[0:37:20] <%GraceTBM> Crazy Talk, Pat, that's what he's complaining about
[0:37:21] <crazy_laughter> immediately fucked it up
[0:37:21] <Dragon_Batman> Despite the misses it is better than the first stream
[0:37:21] <+smuggleruncle> crazy talk ON
[0:37:22] <HitchhikingThrough> a calculated ruse
[0:37:22] <+solzan2000> lol

[0:37:50] <zajoestar> tons of knives
[0:37:50] <thepiefoot> I can't believe Woolie is going at a REASONABLE pace PogChamp
[0:37:50] <%GraceTBM> I always killed with the knife on the floor and never got tagged if I was attacking the legs
[0:37:50] <+dukenux> Gotta save that ammo
[0:37:51] <alcors_wisdom> crazy talk is essential the same as doppios power its just pat doesnt have hair to see into the future with
[0:37:53] <MarylandJutsu> @Dingo_Eejit antique bullets
[0:37:54] <gustavozxd> knifing downed zombies has a chance of getting them up
[0:37:59] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus but woolie, you're supposed to USE consumables!
[0:38:01] <%QueequegTheater> you might need this knife later
[0:38:04] <uncle_christian> #Pattalkscrazy

[0:38:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> know where all the knives are at so you don't have to use ammo you'll "need" for later
[0:38:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good old chess puzzle
[0:38:24] <gigacanuck> gee I wonder where that thing gets used
[0:38:26] <%QueequegTheater> That makes NO SENSE
[0:38:27] <+dukenux> WHAT THE-
[0:38:29] <thepiefoot> It was barely a puzzle in the original

[0:39:01] <uncle_christian> Drink a shot,every time Woolie misses
[0:39:03] <%QueequegTheater> It's still fucking dumb
[0:39:04] <%GraceTBM> Isn't Rook a Siege operator?

[0:39:19] <alexandrecau> rook is in rainbow six
[0:39:20] <gustavozxd> ive been playing dead rising lately and looking at this game now is pretty funny how frank punches a zombie 3 times and the zombie just dies
[0:39:21] <%topendbuzza> so when do the zombie become an idol group?
[0:39:22] <Bagelborn> does anyone else think the zombies sometimes sound like Donkey Kong?
[0:39:24] <TeamAMFer> Schie√ü dem fenster
[0:39:31] <uncle_christian> DK Zed
[0:39:34] <thepiefoot> @nharliecash How so? SMG knee caps every zombie in 3 shots and you can fire nade the G creatures
[0:39:43] <%Aussie_Manny> @WoolieVersus So... you should play Leon and then Claire?
[0:39:48] <%garbocardboardington> I keep forgetting that this is STILL Woolies first playthrough
[0:39:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Disappointed in the lack of r34 for this game. Where's Annette? üò°
[0:39:56] <+nharliecash> this one room is annoying because theres like 6 zombies on the other side of one door
[0:40:00] <%GraceTBM> Gustav, Capcom puts out a gameplay diverse roster, isn't it nuts
[0:40:04] <uncle_christian> K-BAR
[0:40:04] <happyface699> I kinda hate how much of a mess the story is
[0:40:07] <thepiefoot> There IS a manual flashlight mod
[0:40:09] <gustavozxd> I HATE auto flashlights
[0:40:10] <hypecactuar> IS THiS THE CULT OF WOOLIE
[0:40:10] <%LymanAl> Now that's a knife
[0:40:13] <insaneintentionsyo> big gross
[0:40:15] <%wolfofsound> that's not a knife~
[0:40:16] <EuropanLamprey> Delicious delicious knife
[0:40:20] <Greywolf47> better learn to draw if you want more r34
[0:40:22] <rytisone> dual wield
[0:40:22] <%garbocardboardington> Krauser be like "this is a knoife"
[0:40:22] <alcors_wisdom> k-bars are fucking expensive
[0:40:24] <%zenkiro_> zenkiro_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[0:40:26] <ElenaManetta> You ever get in that mentality of, "Oh, game from three months ago? THAT'S SO OLD"
[0:40:29] <Dragon_Batman> It was a good call really
[0:40:32] <%GraceTBM> Yeah, you're right, there haven't been a nearly legit amount of SFM videos
[0:40:34] <SirKamBam> Kombat Time
[0:40:34] <+SolidusRex> There was also a stun gun.
[0:40:36] <thetruenicster> well, Jill got a taser instead
[0:40:36] <PurePlatinumKyo> Jill also got a tazer
[0:40:36] <%ProfessorDetective052996> And a tazer.
[0:40:38] <gustavozxd> If my character has a flashlight i want to use it when I want
[0:40:44] <happyface699> pat people have a lot of problems with this game
[0:40:44] <uncle_christian> Gretta Garbo
[0:40:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's Knife-chan. knife-chan is the best waifu.
[0:40:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> R34 is an integral process of any person learning to draw after all
[0:40:54] <+nharliecash> SPLOOSH
[0:40:54] <+dukenux> wee
[0:40:54] <$cureneckbeard> hi knife

[0:41:08] <$laphyrion> "IT SMELLS LIKE POO GAS DOWN HERE!"
[0:41:08] <+Fantion> Doing Claire first in my first playthrough. Only 3 hours in and got Mr X on my ass. Thought he would come in later
[0:41:12] <+RJay80> urgh shit
[0:41:13] <thepiefoot> Stop talking to yourself, Leon ! Woolie HATES that
[0:41:14] <alcors_wisdom> @rumtumtugnutz much like sawblade-chan but not quite as edgy
[0:41:21] <uncle_christian> Whens Clementine?
[0:41:21] <insaneintentionsyo> oh boy
[0:41:24] <spacecatstreams> leon do a flip
[0:41:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> leon would have big pinkeye
[0:41:33] <+smuggleruncle> REmake scared me more than this but jump scares in RE2 were top
[0:41:34] <%Lion_kun> i'd say woolie could possibly beat the game today but then I remember it's woolie
[0:41:36] <Dragon_Batman> One was a hallway with spiders you just run by right?
[0:41:41] <uncle_christian> Pats mom?
[0:41:46] <%GraceTBM> Frankly, I don't like sewer levels, cause the palette and content are gross. It's just a bummer of a locale
[0:41:49] <thetruenicster> GOD I hate these things
[0:41:51] <rytisone> Woolie once again descending into trash
[0:41:51] <+nharliecash> i forgot how good woolie as at controlling the camera

[0:42:05] <@mothmandraws> wow they made it to blight town already
[0:42:06] <%GraceTBM> @nharliecash You've got it backwards
[0:42:06] <%garbocardboardington> Leon would smeel like dookie from this point forward, including when he meets ada again
[0:42:08] <thepiefoot> You can ran past the G creatures
[0:42:10] <uncle_christian> CrazyTalk
[0:42:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> @thetruenicster Yeah, they're resource sponges
[0:42:14] <+starkandstag> Kappa

[0:42:19] <MajorCrasher> CRAZY TALK
[0:42:19] <%Tangolikeoak> Is this anor londo?
[0:42:21] <%Aussie_Manny> This sewer's better lit than the Battle of Winterfell, to be fair.
[0:42:25] <%Lion_kun> i could do it in 2 but it's woolie so it'll take 8
[0:42:26] <happyface699> Crazy talk
[0:42:28] <valriot> Arya gonna one shot Mr.X
[0:42:29] <%GraceTBM> Does that mean that if you pop the leg of the zombie in the sewer water it'll auto die?
[0:42:34] <happyface699> DAWN OF THE DEAD
[0:42:37] <SomeDwarf> Yes @TeraMercier
[0:42:37] <%garbocardboardington> the new londo waterpark opens TODAY!

[0:42:39] <crazy_laughter> Wouldn't zombies float
[0:42:39] <thepiefoot> The sewer is better lit than the last episode of GOT
[0:42:42] <Prevot> why would zombies on the ocean floor not just get eaten by fish?
[0:42:42] <Dragon_Batman> LUL

[0:43:03] <%GraceTBM> Wow, that's like, the tiniest reward for a very specific degree of obscured accuracy
[0:43:04] <snakemuho> and then the dead didn't even leave the North Keepo
[0:43:04] <Greywolf47> we need more zombie fishes.

[0:44:36] <+Fantion> basically
[0:44:38] <%LymanAl> They make a big noise
[0:44:39] <worldbrand> Moneybags required
[0:44:41] <%Aussie_Manny> Bruh, that was an EXPENSIVE blob.
[0:44:44] <+Tearonex> big boys with big poise
[0:44:44] <MarylandJutsu> OR run past them?
[0:44:46] <$cureneckbeard> bye knife

[0:44:50] <+Judeknight> I still struggle with dodging them
[0:44:50] <thetruenicster> im glad we all agree the G Adults are The Worst
[0:44:55] <%garbocardboardington> A disgusting Bleub
[0:44:56] <+FloorBurger> Shoot colostomy bags for BIG damage
[0:44:56] <@mothmandraws> grenade parry
[0:44:56] <happyface699> @parapattern You shoot zombies in there so there heads explode
[0:44:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> Best way to fight these guys? Don't
[0:44:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Much like real life, eyeballs are always a weak-point
[0:45:01] <siamzero94> just ignore them woolie
[0:45:03] <%doomerskeletor13> lewdskeletor13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Howdy Pat and Woolie! Love you guys! Gearbox really needs to drop Randy. He's like Rhonda in MK11, everytime he talks I want him to shut up. Also Woolie tell pat to stream Tales from the Borderlands!
[0:45:05] <%GraceTBM> Does it do more tangible damage to throw one at them instead of defend?
[0:45:07] <+nharliecash> i think that doctors once found an eye inside a tumor and shinji mikami must have thought that was the tightest shit
[0:45:09] <uncle_christian> LB
[0:45:17] <%garbocardboardington> I wouldnt want MY colostomy bag getting shot
[0:45:18] <thepiefoot> @TeraMercier Throwing does more damage
[0:45:23] <+C24U> 2 flame rounds kills them for Claire easy
[0:45:23] <+Fantion> RB
[0:45:27] <%GraceTBM> Hit the colostomy bag with a grenade for maximum shame
[0:45:27] <%Lion_kun> what if you need it later
[0:45:29] <MajorCrasher> just toss it
[0:45:31] <Dragon_Batman> Throwing it is better yea
[0:45:34] <Parapattern> @happyface699 That thing clearly didn't have a head
[0:45:37] <snakemuho> colostomy eye
[0:45:37] <%GraceTBM> Excellent, I'm glad it was adressed

[0:45:52] <Shini6arcane> ive seen enough hentai to know where this is going
[0:45:52] <alcors_wisdom> grenades do more damage thrown than they do as a defensive move
[0:45:54] <HitchhikingThrough> oh god damn it i missed the g-creatures
[0:45:55] <Greywolf47> G spot

[0:55:11] <Graxe_> Than back when Outbreak came out
[0:55:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> And think think think
[0:55:15] <%GraceTBM> The Leon in the CG movies was so conservatively different than RE4, it felt super restrained
[0:55:16] <%Solidnick18> and pluging
[0:55:17] <Junkfist> Everyone in RE should have a mustache.

[0:55:38] <%Solidnick18> it's pretty confusing
[0:55:43] <%GraceTBM> This is just a note that tells you that this is the stupidest puzzle ever
[0:55:47] <dreu81> I wonder if Woolie still has the prince Charles pic under the toilet tank lid
[0:55:53] <Junkfist> Big strong burly cowboy mustaches.

[0:56:03] <garbageheaphound> such shitty discussions
[0:56:04] <devanmuse> it's one of THESE puzzles
[0:56:04] <SomeDwarf> Okay if I had to work in a sewer like this and we lost the code to THIS SHIT my note would be 10,000% more disgruntled
[0:56:04] <wydamn> @PlainSimpleTailor they made a song during FFX during a puzzle level and it went viral
[0:56:06] <CptBritches> I like this puzzle :)
[0:56:08] <marvel877> get the cheat sheet
[0:56:08] <gigacanuck> what hell is this
[0:56:10] <$laphyrion> FUCK the 2nd run's version of this puzzle.
[0:56:12] <%GraceTBM> Could they not just afford two sets of plugs so that you can work efficiently?
[0:56:13] <ZephynM> Oh yeah, this was so fun to solve the first time around. Good luck, have fun.
[0:56:14] <overlordkog> Anyone else hear the rumor of a possible Remake 3 being handed off to another company?

[0:56:47] <%doomerskeletor13> @skitsoguy Heyo
[0:56:52] <garbageheaphound> imagine someone giving these kind of instructions
[0:56:54] <jorgeniev> @WoolieVersus should RE outbreak get a remake?
[0:57:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Calek I guess you can consider it a logic puzzle, maybe? I used to do a lot of those when I was younger
[0:57:03] <thepiefoot> @overlordkog I've read it too, i am not 100% worried since a lot of the assets already exist and OG RE3 was also handled by a different team
[0:57:03] <MarylandJutsu> @akuda_bar i mean the same could be said of the Statue in the police station
[0:57:07] <DrDialUp> Woolie still hasnt finished this game?
[0:57:11] <MarylandJutsu> no
[0:57:14] <happyface699> @jorgeniev Absolutely
[0:57:14] <DjTrev42> i had to look up what chess piece was which when i played this lol
[0:57:15] <Graxe_> Man, if the pawn placement was a lie.

[0:57:17] <+Th3SmartAlec> why would you ____ in Resident Evil

[0:57:35] <london_flexing> !uptime
[0:57:36] <%GraceTBM> If an Outbreak remake would require co op, it would probably be a really big endeavor, for something that didn't get an enormous amount of backing in the first place
[0:57:41] <wydamn> actually, this is the better edit of the FFX Puzzle song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lb5Jl0mCRI
[0:57:46] <%doomerskeletor13> RE story is literally just them coming up with excuses for gameplay
[0:57:47] <Graxe_> Yeah, looks like Moobot is defeated.
[0:57:56] <+ananzisour> they've been going for a bit over an hour
[0:57:56] <happyface699> @teramercier It could break ground
[0:57:57] <@akuda_bar> lol yeah, looks like it
[0:58:03] <@akuda_bar> everyone behave
[0:58:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Graxe_ The evil has been defeated!

[1:04:06] <garbageheaphound> which you had none of
[1:04:07] <+Th3SmartAlec> observation? On this stream?
[1:04:08] <MatTrix77> With SOME observation
[1:04:08] <alexandrecau> woolie is so out of his element
[1:04:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> We must continue the redfield bloodline
[1:04:10] <siamzero94> guess what chat was doing woolie
[1:04:12] <Froyuken> wonder if that note wss added late in development.
[1:04:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @kryedge Oh shit, Part 8 has a main villain now? Neat
[1:04:13] <%GraceTBM> Woolie the non reader confirmed
[1:04:13] <thepiefoot> @kryedge Huh, weird. I am 4 chapter away
[1:04:20] <$trueherobappo> Yes you did..
[1:04:20] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @thepiefoot I was unable to do that but I did it enough times to get tired of playing it hahaha
[1:04:21] <@Menitta> He does have America's Ass
[1:04:21] <uncle_christian> STOCK
[1:04:22] <+thebonebard> no one sees it the first time
[1:04:22] <%Solidnick18> stock aye
[1:04:27] <+dukenux> LOCK STOCK
[1:04:28] <wydamn> Thinking and spheres, and pushing, and deciphering
[1:04:31] <$laphyrion> BAM.
[1:04:31] <Th3rd3> Remington
[1:04:33] <+dukenux> and two smoking barrels
[1:04:34] <technicstars> the fact that leon talks to himself is what made me purchase this game literally just now
[1:04:35] <Graxe_> And it's a great shotgun
[1:04:37] <Tampaoster> Super shotgun
[1:04:38] <siamzero94> i did
[1:04:38] <SirKamBam> You did it.
[1:04:38] <gigacanuck> unlocked: bestest shotgun
[1:04:39] <TungstenViper> guys is it only me or Twitch lags as fuck tonight?
[1:04:41] <Greywolf47> PogChamp
[1:04:41] <+CJett92> s p e e d
[1:04:43] <DrkJP520> unless you know and you focus, it just looks like scrachmarks
[1:04:44] <rytisone> maximum boomstick
[1:04:44] <%topendbuzza> SPEED
[1:04:47] <gigacanuck> the fastest shotgun
[1:04:48] <thepiefoot> @ThatGuyfromMars G4 was a nightmare, the fucker didn't go down fast enough and he ruined my S+ run
[1:04:49] <Dragon_Batman> Now it's headshot everytime
[1:04:52] <%Solidnick18> Speed is life
[1:04:52] <%GraceTBM> Just open up on a motherfucker
[1:04:54] <+ThatGuyfromMars> seems like it's just you @tungstenviper
[1:05:00] <+mans51> stocks the name, speeds my game
[1:05:04] <uncle_christian> Pat is a Gun nut?
[1:05:04] <$laphyrion> Use that badboy for a high chance of head-pops.
[1:05:05] <StarkAvKnark> maximum boomstick
[1:05:06] <Graxe_> The classic RE2 upgraded shotgun had the better boom sound, though.
[1:05:10] <+smuggleruncle> no shut up
[1:05:10] <kryedge> Pat, do you plan to read JoJo soon? Part 8 is turning out to be an insane bizarre adventure
[1:05:11] <CryptusMaximus> Fun tip: Safe directions don't matter, just as long as you alternate them.
[1:05:11] <CptBritches> It's a vidya game
[1:05:13] <ZephynM> Speed because the stock helps keep the gun steady after firing.
[1:05:16] <KgKid51> S P. E. E. D
[1:05:21] <natebud> Managing recoil makes it easier to fire faster.
[1:05:21] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @thepiefoot and that's why I won't do it, that and the 2 hr max
[1:05:23] <Ahack13> No guys, thats how that gun works IN REAL LIFE
[1:05:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus You stablize your shot faster so you can headshot the zombies
[1:05:26] <%Mr_Plate_Of_Soup> bday100 Leon isn‚Äôt just a snacc, boi‚Äôs a whole ass dessert! bday100
[1:05:28] <uncle_christian> NO THEY ARE NOT
[1:05:28] <defaultname3887> Testing
[1:05:30] <gigacanuck> I mean, it's no DOOM Super Shotgun
[1:05:32] <$trueherobappo> spEEd
[1:05:34] <Reverend_Roscoe> REDUCED RECOIL MEANS YOU ARE ON TARGET FASTER
[1:05:36] <Graxe_> Guns are a controlled explosion in your hands
[1:05:37] <+countgaculatv> It's faster aiming
[1:05:38] <+chaumiester> Guns... in real life or guns in this game?
[1:05:38] <%GraceTBM> It means you can put more directed force into your pump instead of using inefficient hand pumping
[1:05:39] <SomeDwarf> They did, but I think there's another one you can do.
[1:05:40] <TungstenViper> @ThatGuyfromMars cool... always happy to know that interent problems are only my side :(
[1:05:40] <alexandrecau> it's a gun woolie
[1:05:44] <MajorCrasher> the pistol stock gives it burst fire
[1:05:45] <alexandrecau> the gun is weird
[1:05:46] <%GraceTBM> Pistol grip pumping that is
[1:05:46] <Brother_Coduss> @WoolieVersus how are guns weird pat? you point, pull trigger, make boom and someone dies
[1:05:47] <Dragon_Batman> Going through the floor while grabbed?
[1:05:48] <uncle_christian> He's happy to see Leon
[1:05:49] <%TheNewJapanGuy> weout weout weout
[1:05:49] <siamzero94> it's called physics
[1:05:50] <shadowcat6lives> sup chat sup woolie sup pat
[1:05:51] <Graxe_> And that explosion is used to propel a piece of metal
[1:05:51] <+Th3SmartAlec> POP
[1:05:51] <%Solidnick18> Nice

[1:06:02] <+TheImmortal70> Man shit must be DIRE if that many crits are happening

[1:06:05] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Plus Wollie have you tried to pump a shotgun without a stock? Kind of a bitch to do.

[1:13:02] <DrkJP520> "film? what's that?" -the new generation
[1:13:02] <thepiefoot> @Froyuken Right? I got used to the little amount that Hardcore gives you
[1:13:09] <+countgaculatv> Yeah, I only ever played Hardcore so I was baffled when I see people with large inventories.
[1:13:12] <Laecerelius> Yaaay!

[1:13:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DrkJP520 Film? Like a movie?
[1:13:27] <Froyuken> You only get two on hardcore.
[1:13:31] <+TheImmortal70> Inventory gets halved
[1:13:39] <SomeDwarf> You get like, 4, I think
[1:13:43] <%khalcipher> TRU
[1:13:44] <+TheImmortal70> Nah it's 3
[1:13:46] <technicstars> that's brutal

[1:13:55] <waterstealer> THANK YOU
[1:13:56] <GameXful2> I think you don't get the one in the lab
[1:13:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Better difficulty than bullet sponges
[1:14:01] <+TheImmortal70> The only inventory things you get are the ones you have to work for
[1:14:06] <waterstealer> >stares at this war of mine
[1:14:10] <%GraceTBM> Means you can't hoard shit you gotta use it
[1:14:13] <+Nomicro4u> Agreed Bullet sponging is lazy difficulty slider
[1:14:13] <waterstealer> >stares at darkest dungeon
[1:14:14] <CptBritches> Well, just turning up enemies health numbers is a boring difficulty increase
[1:14:16] <%GraceTBM> Unless you're pat
[1:14:16] <ZephynM> :P If you think Hardcore inventory is bad, try going through the game never using the item box
[1:14:18] <+countgaculatv> Yeah, but the shot gun didn't take like two slots back in old RE right? or am I just crazy?
[1:14:20] <@Menitta> !uptime
[1:14:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> There is more items to get in this one
[1:14:23] <TungstenViper> people that don't enjoy it are straight up WRONG
[1:14:23] <technicstars> pat's worst nightmare: a game where you can't hoard.
[1:14:29] <+TheImmortal70> So the one from the two keypad keys, the one from the lab, and the one from the RPD safe
[1:14:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @TeraMercier tell that to Pat's run through of Hardcore
[1:14:30] <Froyuken> oh, it's been a minute since I played. How many do you get on Hardcore?
[1:14:30] <@Menitta> shit
[1:14:33] <+SolidusRex> It was a key item, not a weapon

[2:15:06] <happyface699> for the people
[2:15:06] <dickbuttwoman> Pat, if he's in there, you need to read the comics.
[2:15:07] <+Nomicro4u> that is DA WEY TO DO IT
[2:15:08] <+Shotgundam009> Sonic was filmed in Uganda
[2:15:10] <sir_nack> I really don't expect anyone who worked on writing that movie would even know what ugandan knuckles is
[2:15:10] <siamzero94> that would make slighty more tolerable
[2:15:12] <+pkmamsters> AFTER CREDITS: "Sir, there's a disturbance in Uganda." "Show me..."
[2:15:13] <$Louie_Salmon> @teramercier Sanic is a shirt in Sonic forces and the guy who animated tails gets tricked did the Mania intro, there is no distinction anymore.
[2:15:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Start the clock

[2:15:18] <HitchhikingThrough> holy shit that movie is going to be such a trashfire
[2:15:20] <GundamF91> Uganda Knuckles is alot less popular of a meme than u think
[2:15:20] <godzookylives> It's not gay in Zimbabwe
[2:15:23] <+CJett92> I hope Sonic has a love triangle
[2:15:25] <KaironFortressKnight> How can this be
[2:15:26] <+thesw1tch> @dementedpenguin it cost 20 million for him to be in kickass 2, and he wasnt even in the full movie
[2:15:28] <drewslo> Ugandan knuckles will be some shitty drawing in an elementary school

[2:19:10] <%QueequegTheater> It's only good in the lab tbh
[2:19:12] <hassanico> It's probably one of the better game flamethrowers
[2:19:14] <Froyuken> This puzzle took me about 10 minutes.
[2:19:15] <HitchhikingThrough> "TELL HIM ABOUT HIMSELF"
[2:19:17] <hassanico> It actually kills shit
[2:19:18] <Huntercd> We Ripley now

[2:19:24] <+mans51> @hassanico not saying much but okay
[2:19:27] <+duskrush> Overthinking it
[2:19:28] <+dukenux> God, Dead Space flamethrower was so shit
[2:19:28] <Junkfist> I always thought it was weird that one time in the cartoon Sonic looked directly at the audience and said "liberalism is moral degeneracy" before spindashing
[2:19:28] <uncle_christian> Woolie will screw up the flame
[2:19:31] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie no Logic isn't as strong here
[2:19:31] <siamzero94> g-monsters and plants are best
[2:19:32] <Graxe_> Fire only hurts you when it is shot at you
[2:19:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fill those zombies with your burning love
[2:19:33] <alexandrecau> gun woolie
[2:19:35] <+thebonebard> burned brain
[2:19:36] <+dukenux> only good for one type of enemies
[2:19:38] <Graxe_> Or when it explodes
[2:19:43] <+Jessie_Lockhart> ‚ÄúFlaming hobos‚Äù - Cloverfield
[2:19:43] <RiceeFTW> the longer you hold it, the more damage tho
[2:19:45] <JustTossedMyCoin999> but what about trickster tho
[2:19:46] <Froyuken> Yeah, they Nerfed this weapon hard.
[2:19:46] <+lordfunkyfist> But what do the burning zombies do on Gunslinger mode
[2:19:48] <%GraceTBM> So maybe use it on more complicated enemies
[2:19:49] <$laphyrion> YOU PUT THAT FLAMETHROWER AWAY RIGHT NOW!
[2:19:51] <uncle_christian> YEA
[2:19:52] <eldragon_1> It's a GUN
[2:19:55] <RiceeFTW> oh but yeah it was nerfed
[2:19:56] <%khalcipher> YEa
[2:19:57] <majindusto> YES
[2:19:59] <+TruSanKyuu> Yes
[2:20:00] <Hiro01231> yes
[2:20:01] <+shiplord13> In this game yeah
[2:20:02] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> don't spoil, chat
[2:20:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie's Weakness is his own Galaxy Brain
[2:20:02] <JustTossedMyCoin999> YES
[2:20:03] <CptBritches> It's a video game, not real life
[2:20:03] <KazMkII> Yes
[2:20:04] <+duskrush> yep
[2:20:04] <DeadNinja1> No
[2:20:05] <subSenpai> yes
[2:20:07] <Dragon_Batman> No but this game is wacky
[2:20:07] <Froyuken> You'll definitely need it later.
[2:20:07] <HitchhikingThrough> Not really but it didn't happen
[2:20:08] <%TeethMuncher> yeah
[2:20:08] <insaneintentionsyo> weed
[2:20:09] <%doomerskeletor13> What does it do in Trickster?
[2:20:13] <Sloavon> no smoilers SHH
[2:20:14] <siamzero94> woolie why
[2:20:16] <$Louie_Salmon> You really have to hold it for it to be useful
[2:20:17] <+thebonebard> i feel like a flamethrower would actually be dangerous as fuck to real zombies, pretty sure flamethrowers shoot flaming liquids that would go right through flesh
[2:20:17] <thepiefoot> Doesn't it do DOT ?
[2:20:19] <+thesw1tch> lol
[2:20:22] <uncle_christian> Woolie tunes out PAT
[2:20:22] <%Mr_Plate_Of_Soup> Woolie never overthinks anything in Resident Evil.
[2:20:24] <Graxe_> So when does Dante get a flamethrower?
[2:20:25] <+dukenux> @lewdskeletor13 It's a gun
[2:20:27] <hassanico> AKA bosses
[2:20:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> Like G beasts
[2:20:31] <majindusto> ITS A GUN, WOOLIE
[2:20:32] <DiegoLeaoBR> Zombies is the literally the Worts
[2:20:38] <%doomerskeletor13> But what does it do in Royal Guard?
[2:20:39] <hassanico> and SPOILER ENEMY
[2:20:40] <natebud> It's decent when zombies are bunched up and you don't really have to aim.
[2:20:41] <DiegoLeaoBR> Target I mean
[2:20:41] <%QueequegTheater> WHAT DOES IT DO IN TRICKSTER THO
[2:20:44] <%GraceTBM> Using a flamethrower in any of the hallways of this game would be a massive clusterfuck
[2:20:45] <JustTossedMyCoin999> What about Swordmaster tho?
[2:20:47] <$cureneckbeard> THIS IS A FLAMMENWERFER it WERFS FLAMMEN
[2:20:49] <lloyddboy> UNGH
[2:20:50] <Sloavon> flamethrower in DMC should be an arm
[2:20:51] <InugamiTheHound> but what does sword master and trickers do for the flamethrower

[2:24:56] <%GraceTBM> Dante certainly is the coolest virgin
[2:24:56] <MajorCrasher> man I hope RE3 Remake is next
[2:24:57] <TungstenViper> DMC5 Gubslinger still feels awkward tho... twosome time could have been reworked a little...

[2:26:15] <KaironFortressKnight> Wesker and Vergil are the only characters allowed to fuck.
[2:26:16] <Dragon_Batman> You just practice it
[2:26:19] <+duskrush> Hesitance is nature's input lag
[2:26:20] <ospreyworks> This area is the coolest, nastiest thing they added to the game.
[2:26:24] <Junkfist> Wesker only wanted those photos of Rebecca because he's really into basketball.

[2:27:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus darksouls
[2:27:43] <Froyuken> This one.
[2:27:43] <%doomerskeletor13> The spark gun is really good against them
[2:27:43] <MattySkull> The Flamethrower is also STUPIDLY good against Lab enemies

[2:27:53] <happyface699> Dead island
[2:27:54] <natebud> Oh no. What will Woolie do without all his magnum ammo!? Kappa
[2:28:07] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Spark is also awesome, but best when the eye is exposed
[2:28:14] <siamzero94> Flame should be used primarily in the next section anyways
[2:28:21] <+duskrush> The irony is that I'm overprotective of my magnum ammo and nothing else
[2:28:25] <Prevot> but what if I need it laaaaater
[2:28:25] <ospreyworks> Leon with the short-sleeved shirt < the long-sleeved uniform. It looks just a little too dorky to me.

[2:30:15] <lloyddboy> HOW CAN THIS BE

[2:32:40] <corepercentlives> Given how much resi characters can resist wounds and fatal shots umbrella should research them and screw the viruses
[2:32:44] <wydamn> Woolie, you should get attacked more to maximize your healing potential.
[2:32:44] <rytisone> unless you get combo'd
[2:32:45] <%GraceTBM> But Woolie's aim has improved so much that it's almost like he's playing on assisted

[3:03:10] <+thebonebard> @RiceeFTW what how?
[3:03:10] <$Louie_Salmon> @answer_moose And every time you open it, the items re-randomize, and only 5 items fit on screen at a time so you have to scroll
[3:03:11] <corepercentlives> Never carry more than 3 handgun bullets and empty shotgun Kappa
[3:03:12] <InugamiTheHound> MUF? "material unaccounted for"
[3:03:15] <insaneintentionsyo> remind him to go back there eventually

[3:04:09] <251am> maybe
[3:04:10] <DiegoLeaoBR> Pat is just jealous of the Woolie powerhouse I say
[3:04:10] <+thesw1tch> put the grenade away
[3:04:12] <+Shotgundam009> both
[3:04:18] <+duskrush> You probably don't need the magnum for the time being
[3:04:20] <$Louie_Salmon> If you big fuck-up THAT bad, you may as well die.
[3:04:25] <Dragon_Batman> you can make some Shottys
[3:04:28] <+thesw1tch> why
[3:04:37] <Dragon_Batman> or save for Mugnums
[3:04:37] <DiegoLeaoBR> Now Pat, send him to the licker room

[3:04:43] <%Dr00_PhD> @Sloavon If you like the characters and want more social link type stuff without any real plot relevance than yeah
[3:04:46] <Thunderhog> @Sloavon It's pretty meh if you really like music games, but if you dont play them too much is a nice starter
[3:04:48] <%QueequegTheater> Put away at least two of those guns
[3:04:54] <gustavozxd> use the magnum ONLY FOR THE FINAL BOSS Kappa
[3:04:55] <+TalBZ> @Sloavon Only if you REALLY REALLY like P5 and its music
[3:04:57] <ZeroCruz> Oh boy
[3:05:06] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie, I don't think you need the magnum cause you don't need to fight a boss during map exploration
[3:05:09] <+SolidusRex> Stuff the Magnum
[3:05:10] <RiceeFTW> pat looks disgusted
[3:05:21] <+TalBZ> @Sloavon I got maybe 10 hours in it before I got bored, so I'd say wait for a sale
[3:05:21] <Dragon_Batman> He should stuff the Mugnum
[3:05:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> ...all of them?
[3:05:30] <%QueequegTheater> PUT AWAY SOME GUNS
[3:05:31] <+korth367> this is actively killing pat
[3:05:35] <Froyuken> shh. Let him figure it out.

[3:05:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> put the lotion in the basket
[3:05:59] <$Louie_Salmon> In my first playthrough ever I took Pat's advice to not carry healing ever and it was great, I never had inventory problems
[3:06:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> Woolie what do you need the weapons for when you're backtracking to get items
[3:06:12] <wydamn> Can Woolie figure THIS out?
[3:06:16] <Sloavon> thanks for the advice guys!

[3:07:45] <$Louie_Salmon> Wait. Is Carrying 4 guns and 2 full heals the inverse of the "What if I need it Later" mentality, I.E. "What if I need it now"? Is that even a goblin?

[3:18:00] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Hey Pat, since you've been conquering your gobelins recently, would you consider taking another crack at Subnautica?

[3:18:19] <+lazysaiyajin> √âlaboration!
[3:18:20] <Mrsupergen> You cant just say that and not elaborate woolie
[3:18:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> one drug is legal
[3:18:22] <@Menitta> Vergil: Give that to me Dante: Youve already got one
[3:18:22] <Press_X_ToJASON> your money is drugs now
[3:18:23] <HitchhikingThrough> How the FUCK ARE WE STILL GETTING MORE WOOLIE LORE AFTER 6 YEARS
[3:18:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie sister stole his kideny

[3:18:26] <RiceeFTW> but one is taxed LUL
[3:18:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> WEED LMAL
[3:18:31] <+thesw1tch> vaping is worse than weed though
[3:18:32] <@akuda_bar> @Mrsupergen he definitely can
[3:18:32] <thelonechris> Vape contains nickel
[3:18:36] <GalacticaPhanto> beyblades are bad
[3:18:38] <jubejube56> Marijuana is not ‚Äúall drugs‚Äù woolie
[3:18:41] <%QueequegTheater> Weed is much less unhealthy than tobacco
[3:18:42] <Johno_san> weel is so much healthier that tabacco
[3:18:43] <wydamn> @Youwereeatenbyalid he has very good writers
[3:18:48] <+krispen_wa> vaping makes you look like a douche, which is far worse than anything
[3:18:50] <InugamiTheHound> vape cigs you have to buy and tax them
[3:18:55] <PSI_Guy95> FUCK OFF
[3:18:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> DUDE WEED WEED DUDE
[3:19:01] <PSI_Guy95> that's bullshit
[3:19:04] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus vaping is like concentrated cigarette smoking
[3:19:08] <@Menitta> Those anti smoking adds should really just give everyone who doesnt smoke $20 so they dont smoke
[3:19:08] <%Padridis> like 50% of recycling ends up in the ocean anyway =/ Sad shit
[3:19:09] <+dukenux> the problem with vaping is that they can put whatever there
[3:19:10] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Hey Pat, since you've been conquering your gobelins recently, would you consider taking another crack at Subnautica?
[3:19:16] <+duskrush> I only MADE the poison, but if you put it on the ground, it's 100% your fault
[3:19:17] <Tucker0603> any smoke inhilation type anything is fucking stupid

[3:25:41] <InugamiTheHound> ebola is really bad and its worst because 3rd world countries don't have infrastructure to have clean water

[3:35:47] <CptBritches> How can this be?
[3:35:50] <@PeachSaliva> Pat has the drip? I knew it
[3:35:50] <SilentGaming49> Is the code, "Leon's a cuck"?
[3:35:51] <%Mighty_observer> @PeachSaliva becauce everything is a lie
[3:35:52] <%Solidnick18> fake zombo
[3:35:54] <@PeachSaliva> It explains so much
[3:35:58] <+krispen_wa> IS that a yellow version of the Hemwick Witches?

[3:36:10] <+DocFish> watch out for the crimson heads
[3:36:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat doesn't have the Drip, that would require sauce, and for him to have sauce he needs flava
[3:36:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Mr. X was here. Leon is a loser
[3:36:15] <%ProfessorDetective052996> I just realized: that shotgun on Leon's back is like a full meter long. You'd expect that thing to fire ten gauge shells.
[3:36:16] <Jakev91489> Now is when the game DROWNS you in gunpowder
