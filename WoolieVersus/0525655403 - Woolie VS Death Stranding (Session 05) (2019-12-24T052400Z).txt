[0:16:00] <Haarute> to be fair the "mid or feed" thing is more of a joke nowadays.
[0:16:01] <dabeaminator> Is DMC 5 even nominated for Game of the Year?
[0:16:08] <CuteDad69> nah
[0:16:11] <+linSP> i thought people played mobas for the vore
[0:16:11] <%Lion_kun> It got best action game.
[0:16:11] <SunPraiser> no
[0:16:12] <sparkly_yoyo> For music at least
[0:16:17] <CuteDad69> its up for best action and OST
[0:16:18] <sparkly_yoyo> and action
[0:16:24] <@Solidus_113> There is a character who literally gets bigger as he eats enemies. Name's Cho'Gath
[0:16:29] <+ggbhtg> TOP FED TOP KEK
[0:16:32] <@Menitta> Jedi Fallen Order is fucking rad
[0:16:39] <dabeaminator> That's awful. The game awards are a joke though, so I guess it doesn't matter.
[0:16:47] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Theres actually a character in League that literally vores you and spits you out
[0:16:54] <CuteDad69> its still nice to see DMC 5 get ANY attention
[0:16:55] <%Lion_kun> Jedi Fallen Order is a good game that could be great if not for EA bullshit.
[0:17:16] <@Menitta> It is great tho
[0:17:22] <hntronium> Plague host

[0:17:28] <duathadruid> plague raid
[0:17:29] <darkbotle> Hello from Plagues stream :)
[0:17:30] <dabeaminator> Hi plague
[0:17:31] <%Lion_kun> I got the PS4 version and I had to suffer my fair share of bugs, stuttering and even the game having to load assets.
[0:17:42] <%karldeck> I miss the guys animations
[0:17:46] <@Solidus_113> Old Joseph
[0:17:49] <sparkly_yoyo> The VGA are a joke, everyone just cares about the announcements. Pretending to be the Oscars is pathetic. The thuggery and childishness of games are the spiciness that give them life.
[0:17:52] <%Lion_kun> Also bad loading times and unresponsive controls.
[0:17:53] <redwilt> Iggy
[0:17:54] <KingHyperbole> Josuke wouldn't even realize
[0:17:57] <Prevot> Joseph would use hamon on the liquid diarrhea
[0:17:58] <%karldeck> They did amazing animation of it
[0:17:58] <KingHyperbole> Okuyasu*
[0:17:58] <CuteDad69> joseph
[0:18:00] <KingHyperbole> brain fart
[0:18:00] <sparkly_yoyo> SHIT IS NOT CRASH
[0:18:01] <T_Sasquatch> That is pure power and I'd love a low stakes highschool level villain like that
[0:18:03] <Haarute> yeyeye part 5
[0:18:03] <+ggbhtg> Buurown NOTTO
[0:18:04] <duathadruid> Jotaro would definitely shit his pants if it was to spite his enemy
[0:18:05] <dabeaminator> Jotaro can stop time and just take it out.
[0:18:08] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Part 5 is the BEST
[0:18:13] <Jathspuh> KappaPride
[0:18:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Josuke would unshit himself with Crazy Diamond
[0:18:16] <Haarute> part 5 is so much fun.
[0:18:17] <T_Sasquatch> Italian Twinks
[0:18:20] <%Lion_kun> I want Part 6. Gimme my queen.
[0:18:26] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Melone is husbando
[0:18:27] <sparkly_yoyo> 15 year olds dude
[0:18:27] <CuteDad69> waiting for part 7
[0:18:30] <hntronium> I fucking hate those clothers
[0:18:31] <MSN04_Sazabi> Gappy would probably not give a single shred of a fuck about shitting his pants
[0:18:37] <+linSP> part 5 best twinks
[0:18:37] <UmjackTah> Giorno would just ignore it, he drinks piss no problem
[0:18:38] <hntronium> They give me a massive headache
[0:18:44] <Jathspuh> @GeneralSCPatton he can't use crazy diamond on himself D:
[0:18:47] <hntronium> Too many holes
[0:18:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> WAIT WHAT!
[0:18:50] <SocialMisfitGamer> Get ready for Everything to be taken out of context
[0:18:50] <T_Sasquatch> @lion_kun are you speaking of the correct Queen tho
[0:18:50] <CuteDad69> giorno would turn it into a snake
[0:18:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> I WAS JUST JOKING!
[0:18:59] <dabeaminator> @MSN04_Sazabi Joshu would be into it.
[0:19:04] <%Lion_kun> Jolyne is my Queen.

[0:37:36] <SunPraiser> The vocal cord parasites are behind this
[0:37:41] <+Cymen90> But even when you listen to your own voice on playback, you are not hearing yourself because you perceive it differently as well

[1:12:31] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Have you ever considered an editor for bumble-compilations?
[1:12:34] <CuteDad69> Chat*
[1:12:42] <+Grayhammatter> chat got fed
[1:12:46] <SunPraiser> so this is DIO's World...
[1:12:47] <+AbnormalVoid> Just make sure the bumbling is interesting and funny and there's no problem, have fun with it, do the big joke
[1:12:47] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> is this was the world feels like
[1:12:55] <DatAsuna> Maybe call it a "Side-Op" episode?
[1:12:58] <+tuchpi> good :)
[1:12:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Chat isn't just fed, chat is full
[1:13:16] <smugjorgen98> what chapter hes in
[1:13:17] <sparkly_yoyo> I'd say cut it and put it up in a way it feels like an extra
[1:13:17] <gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Why the LP kayfabe and not just cut the stream up and upload stream parts with chat and talks and all
[1:13:18] <Milo_Oda> Sausage DansGame im vegetarian
[1:13:21] <SunPraiser> top is fed
[1:13:24] <Cajjunb> hey whats up woolie, good to see ya streaming!
[1:13:38] <+D00msDayDan> BTs are fed as fuck
[1:13:53] <gunsrlove> They refuse the future
[1:14:01] <+Cymen90> They deny the future
[1:14:05] <CuteDad69> wait has woolie FED the BTs yet??
[1:14:05] <Jathspuh> Yeah. That makes sense
[1:14:13] <SunPraiser> but the future refused to change...
[1:14:14] <favadem> put chat o screen
[1:14:19] <vVAstrAVv> yeah i et that
[1:14:22] <Zayasu> LP boomers cmonBruh
[1:14:28] <+tuchpi> chat on screen is a terrible idea
[1:14:30] <+Cymen90> Big boomer opinions
[1:14:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Put a time stamp at the start of the video saying "This is where the bumbling stops guys"
[1:14:50] <+paladinstarbuster> Chat on screen would be cool if people could be cool
[1:15:03] <+Cymen90> Yeah, then people would know why you are suddenly turning around to pick up missed items LUL
[1:15:07] <Milo_Oda> itll be an entire episode of bumbles
[1:15:08] <SunPraiser> I'm saying keep it but if it's poorly recieved I said to cut it and nobody listened
[1:15:08] <%ECRead> so we starting a Crusade against the YouTube crowd? ...cause I'm down for a Crusade or two doodDoom
[1:15:17] <+tuchpi> no one wants to see randos talking during, especially if its a slow chat
[1:15:17] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus I think cutting it up as 16.5 would make people feel like extra content instead of timewasting
[1:15:23] <gunsrlove> CONTENT RACE WAR
[1:15:29] <SunPraiser> finally
[1:15:32] <+Cymen90> Alright, so we start a war with your YT base now?

[1:22:28] <%Ancopro> have you seen elder in a shelter?
[1:22:38] <CuteDad69> hasnt been long enough to establish deep lore yet
[1:22:55] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus focus on the engineer, just trust me
[1:22:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[1:23:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> Definitely start with the engineer
[1:24:23] <+Cymen90> Because you are not using them at all.....which you should.
[1:24:32] <+D00msDayDan> PCCs can't ever build vehicles
[1:24:35] <%Ancopro> i mean they're useless until the chiral network is up
[1:24:35] <+tuchpi> finally ditching pccs PogChamp
[1:24:37] <vVAstrAVv> pccs will become incredibly useful soon
[1:24:38] <sparkly_yoyo> vehicles are fabricated
[1:25:10] <honeyman18> You'll know when you get buildings that are worth making
[1:25:15] <derap41> You're not building shit yet?
[1:25:38] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus you can only build vehicles at garages, PCCs cannot
[1:25:45] <vVAstrAVv> once you unlock timefall shelters youll want at least 2 on you
[1:25:46] <DasFreekman> soon Willie Nelson soon we'll be truckin
[1:25:52] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Think of the other players. Learn how to recognize places in need of structures.
[1:26:02] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> YEAH TRUCKIN'
[1:26:08] <+linSP> pccs get more structures unlocked as you go
[1:26:12] <derap41> Crazy mailmen stealing carho
[1:26:13] <+tuchpi> forsenHobo addiction?
[1:26:16] <Djinnazz> No we RUCKIN'
[1:26:19] <Psyramics> mm yeah, deliveraholics

[1:26:55] <RamenRiderZ> I bet they carry around rocks when theyre really desperate
[1:27:02] <sparkly_yoyo> @RamenRiderZ you might think it's a joke, but some people won't use the social features because they don't want to entruste deliveries to others. Mules are real.
[1:27:18] <+frozenwaifu> lmfao
[1:27:23] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Example: Build post-boxes in areas that people lose their shit a lot.
[1:27:47] <NotHereToStream> the weight shifting issue will be resolved soon, dw
[1:27:52] <%Lion_kun> Delivering yoyr own shit gives you more likes which upgrades your character.
[1:28:01] <SunPraiser> keep on keeping on :)
[1:28:03] <Djinnazz> Helping yourself is helping other ppl.
[1:28:10] <Zayasu> keep on keeping on \ o /
[1:28:11] <%jinking79> kombat time
[1:28:21] <JetpackMcQuack> Jeff Bezos is dissapointed in you Kappa
[1:28:22] <vVAstrAVv> dont worry. big upgrade soon
[1:28:35] <chronoxgp> if you deliver lost cargo to the right person you get cosmetic upgrades otherwise it is just likes and standard orders are pretty much just likes
[1:28:36] <DasFreekman> Yeah i always leave a po box near mule territory
[1:28:37] <sparkly_yoyo> Helping to help helps you, that's the essence of the STRAND
[1:28:49] <+frozenwaifu> was this road made by players? if so, thats fuckin cool
[1:28:59] <+tuchpi> helping yourself ends up helping other people anyways
[1:29:05] <%Lion_kun> I built a road from Port Knot to South Knot.
[1:29:05] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Did you try out Strand Parries yet?
[1:29:12] <vVAstrAVv> going there for the first time usually gets across what needs you want to fill lol
[1:29:15] <%Lion_kun> Let me have my likes.

[1:31:10] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Death Stranding: Social Strand Action
[1:31:11] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> So yeah
[1:31:24] <sparkly_yoyo> you can see all cargo tags
[1:31:26] <honeyman18> combo Pcc's for bullshit, like a storage and watchtower so you can plot and put up your shit before raiding mules
[1:31:36] <%Ancopro> yes good pan
[1:31:36] <ovan20> i just remember that Woolie thinks it's a good idea to puke on your own shirt LUL
[1:31:37] <+tuchpi> detection imminent LUL
[1:31:41] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Read what the STRAND CAN DO

[1:32:12] <+frozenwaifu> have faith
[1:32:22] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Have some faith, Chat.
[1:32:29] <Djinnazz> @Swedish_Expert % min later: "Oh GOD how did this happen?!"

[1:32:51] <Djinnazz> We got it Cymen...
[1:32:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Disoriented is Woolie's entire state of being
[1:32:55] <Swedish_Expert> lets hope strand is going to get some use
[1:33:05] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Just a tip, if for whatever reason you decide not to eat lunch, do not chew an entire pack of gum
[1:33:08] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Woolie will figure it out. Kappa
[1:33:09] <+Cymen90> There we go
[1:33:10] <RamenRiderZ> Strando powa

[1:34:08] <Heartless_01> LUL
[1:34:09] <+D00msDayDan> i like how since woolie doesn't stop moving he doesn't notice how the scans actually work
[1:34:11] <Djinnazz> @Swedish_Expert XD
[1:34:11] <%supersugoisenpai1> This is a bad time to learn
[1:34:13] <vVAstrAVv> not the time to lab the parry wool
[1:34:15] <+berserker_103> spam square
[1:34:22] <ovan20> it's just like a fighting game Woolie rooSmug
[1:34:22] <StarlitStunner> Don’t forget the basics of CQC
[1:34:30] <derap41> Learn to parry fast
[1:34:30] <+experimental_jet> square punch
[1:34:31] <honeyman18> Hold then counter with rt
[1:34:32] <red_blaster> Press L2 with the rope, facing the enemy, then parry with R2
[1:34:33] <jack_s1n> it's a parry
[1:34:35] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Info on Weapon Wheel
[1:34:36] <vVAstrAVv> just mash square
[1:34:36] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Have some faith in Woolie screwing it up.
[1:34:36] <+AbnormalVoid> wait for the R2 Prompt, Woolie
[1:34:37] <+paladinstarbuster> THERE IS A BUTTON PRESS
[1:34:40] <+linSP> the yellow bar over health is your consciousness
[1:34:40] <+experimental_jet> hold L2 and R2 to counter
[1:34:40] <+modelofrags> @WoolieVersus soooo hows it going just finished listening to you talk about vomit for 45 minutes
[1:34:43] <+heyitsdenzel_> hold l2 and r2 and push square to break guard
[1:34:43] <%Ancopro> strand only works after parry or from behind
[1:35:01] <Prevot> always with the left and right
[1:35:21] <Graxe_> Fight time
[1:35:22] <Cajjunb> run
[1:35:24] <+Grayhammatter> oh boy
[1:35:25] <zamzoph> punch the shit out of them

[1:35:39] <Haarute> TAKE HIS SHIT
[1:35:42] <red_blaster> Press R2 twice in a tow to tie them up
[1:35:43] <+berserker_103> I guess Woolie will be playing this game for the rest of the year
[1:36:00] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> LUL
[1:36:01] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus you can parry and bind by pressing R2 twice
[1:36:03] <RamenRiderZ> PKers bullying chaos rune runner
[1:36:05] <honeyman18> The bars overlap each other, so yellow is like a first health bar over another
[1:36:08] <%LordSDB> THE REAL GAME STARTS NOW!
[1:36:08] <Jathspuh> hit them with cargo
[1:36:09] <NotHereToStream> use the cargo to fuck em
[1:36:10] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackWutang woolieYE
[1:36:26] <%Ancopro> BEEF punch
[1:36:28] <chronoxgp> instead of knives broken bottles you have cargo
[1:36:32] <vVAstrAVv> gg
[1:36:41] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[1:36:43] <Graxe_> Mid-combat cargo sorting
[1:36:44] <NotHereToStream> also your first attack in the string has a invincibility start up, so if both attack, you win the exchange
[1:36:44] <+linSP> you can also steamroll by sprinting, holding r2 + l2 and hitting square
[1:36:46] <Tuna_Can_0> saved!
[1:37:10] <Graxe_> It's like RE4 attache case sorting during a fight
[1:37:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:37:12] <Swedish_Expert> PogChamp not bad
[1:37:17] <+Grayhammatter> super full
[1:37:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can do the choke knockout after a parry
[1:37:21] <%Ancopro> you gotta mash R2 for the follow up
[1:37:25] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus you can tie them up after parry, and you can use the cargo to hit them
[1:37:25] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Throwing the cargo is fun.
[1:37:28] <+Grayhammatter> woolie got fed PogChamp
[1:37:28] <%LordSDB> Why tie them up when you can give them a good 1-2.
[1:37:29] <Cajjunb> this is kinda dumb, i love it
[1:37:29] <i_heart_gaming> its good to see him enhoying the gameplay
[1:37:31] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus after parry there is a follow up
[1:37:36] <+linSP> who fed woolie
[1:37:37] <+Cymen90> Mash R2 for instant takedown after sidestep
[1:37:38] <i_heart_gaming> *enjoying
[1:37:39] <zamzoph> they wanted to take your shit, but you took THEIR shit, instead
[1:37:41] <Haarute> no lunch for you today
[1:37:49] <+paladinstarbuster> @WoolieVersus You can parry and choke them out
[1:37:52] <i_heart_gaming> sam is plus 5
[1:38:09] <%Ancopro> yup

[1:38:23] <+DarksideBluez> late to the party here... what happened to his vehicles?
[1:38:27] <vVAstrAVv> you can also use cargo to hit people and throw it
[1:38:36] <+Cymen90> Your stand SMASHMOUTH
[1:38:37] <+tuchpi> @DarksideBluez new zone, can't make them yet
[1:38:42] <+DarksideBluez> oh
[1:38:47] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I am woolie's stand too :)
[1:38:48] <TheNewJapanGuy> !uptime
[1:38:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 48 minutes
[1:38:51] <i_heart_gaming> he has mastered the royal guard
[1:38:52] <Daljac> its like skyrim but youre always overenccumbered
[1:39:00] <%Ancopro> ALSO instead of putting cargo on back, you can grab the cargo mid air and smack boys with it for instant ko
[1:39:01] <+DarksideBluez> @tuchpi thabk you
[1:39:05] <tattleworm> you can also dodge with nothing equipped by holding l2 or r2 and jumping. it's usually easier do that if cargo's obscuring your vision.
[1:39:10] <+DarksideBluez> thank*
[1:39:21] <RamenRiderZ> Kojima should use this tech to make a 3D Oregon Trail
[1:39:21] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus another tactic is to pick up the mule cargo and swing it like a club at them
[1:39:31] <+paladinstarbuster> you also have to kick them to knock them out once youve tied them up.
[1:39:41] <sparkly_yoyo> mules run away from bt and won't bother you if you are empty-handed
[1:39:52] <%Ancopro> its DOPE
[1:39:53] <Tuna_Can_0> eat ladder mules LUL
[1:39:58] <+DarksideBluez> Oregon trail 3d would be sick/ I'd buy
[1:40:01] <honeyman18> It's a one hit ko but it wrecks the cargo
[1:40:15] <chronoxgp> rd2 is pretty much oregon trail
[1:40:22] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[1:40:28] <ovan20> rooPog
[1:40:31] <Cajjunb> kick mules asses with people's lunch box
[1:40:41] <+DarksideBluez> but RD@ doesn't have enough traveling.
[1:40:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> For real?
[1:40:47] <Enyoyable> Hitting them with HIGH PERFORMANCE undewear
[1:40:50] <@SoushinSen> it doesn't sound real....
[1:40:58] <sparkly_yoyo> Junji Ito!
[1:40:59] <%Ancopro> who DAT
[1:40:59] <+Cymen90> JINJO ITO
[1:41:04] <+solzan2000> gets better from here
[1:41:05] <JetpackMcQuack> I saw that too
[1:41:10] <@SoushinSen> i think the footage was someone counter-scan to negate the enemy's scan (real thing in death stranding)
[1:41:12] <CuteDad69> yeah its Junji Ito VOICED BY YURI LOWENTHAL
[1:41:15] <Zayasu> yeah it is Kappa
[1:41:20] <Swedish_Expert> yuri ito
[1:41:20] <gryffinp> hot take kojima's celebrity obsession actively harms his games
[1:41:20] <+tuchpi> thanks yuri :)
[1:41:21] <OldManDeckardCain> NOW IT IS
[1:41:21] <Tuna_Can_0> he might have been jumping out of scan range
[1:41:22] <zamzoph> That's Junji Ito?!
[1:41:27] <Cajjunb> i beat someone with it
[1:41:28] <+solzan2000> yes
[1:41:29] <+TheOlMitcheroo> HEY YURI
[1:41:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheyCallMeVawn
[1:41:30] <+D00msDayDan> deadman isn't voiced by guillermo either
[1:41:31] <i_heart_gaming> thats his IRL dub
[1:41:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Most of Kojima's friends aren't voice actors
[1:41:36] <RamenRiderZ> It's his dub double
[1:41:42] <sparkly_yoyo> drr drr drr
[1:41:43] <+linSP> sorry junji, PT wouldve been great
[1:41:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> DRR DRR DRR

[1:41:57] <honeyman18> Those end monsters killed me
[1:42:09] <gryffinp> Junji Ito's best manga is his Cat Manga.
[1:42:11] <Jathspuh> It didn't work to cure his fear LUL
[1:42:15] <+Cymen90> Except he never got over it as he discovered new things to be scared of lol
[1:42:17] <NotHereToStream> cowards make the best horror?
[1:42:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> she was a true patriot
[1:42:49] <+Cymen90> I will NEVER have to leave this house to see the world!
[1:43:06] <zamzoph> I like that one story where the dad somehow gets stuck under the house foundation. And his family's like, "How did you get there?!" and he's like "Don't worry about it!" It's super short
[1:43:25] <+Cymen90> THEY TOTALLY CAN

[1:47:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> What does FNaF have to do with exoskeletons?
[1:47:37] <+berserker_103> might want to raid that mule camp eventually
[1:47:40] <@Solidus_113> Getting more stars for the Engineer will get you higher level power skeletons
[1:47:47] <NotHereToStream> ^
[1:48:01] <RyuuAoi> Woolie not zip lining it yet? He hasn't found Pat's lines or what?! Keepo
[1:48:07] <sparkly_yoyo> The weight's not the problem, the Jenga is the real Dark Souls
[1:48:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> Ziplines aren't for a while
[1:48:19] <+D00msDayDan> @RyuuAoi at his pace he's about 50 hours away from unlocking ziplines
[1:48:26] <%Lion_kun> Do Elder first

[1:50:08] <RyuuAoi> You a mech now!
[1:50:11] <bupkisoffthechain> the boost is just the sprint
[1:50:28] <+JacknZack27> You can run. Thats it
[1:50:32] <%Ancopro> spring chicken
[1:51:03] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> So hey chat, what are you people doing right now?

[1:51:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:51:16] <+Grayhammatter> that's a huge mountain
[1:51:32] <tattleworm> actually the power skeleton has nothing to do with the double jump, sam can just do it for some reason
[1:51:36] <@Solidus_113> gonna use those ladders in a second
[1:51:36] <i_heart_gaming> I hate this mountain
[1:51:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lion_kun You can do that as long as your weight is low enough. No skeleton needed.
[1:51:37] <+paladinstarbuster> thicc reedus
[1:51:41] <Haarute> sam looking like a thicc boy
[1:51:42] <Djinnazz> Nah, your batery is fine.
[1:51:42] <%supersugoisenpai1> Batteries are not an issue unless you sprint constantly
[1:51:53] <+Cymen90> Why not BUILD or USE a postbox for all that lost cargo? @WoolieVersus
[1:52:04] <i_heart_gaming> ladder bro

[1:52:21] <@Solidus_113> check that cave on the left for a memory chip
[1:52:25] <Tucker0603> Battery is only an issue if you constantly boost
[1:52:26] <%Lion_kun> Must be because I always overburden myself.
[1:52:42] <i_heart_gaming> yes
[1:52:43] <%Lion_kun> I never knew I could do it naturally.

[2:17:23] <+puffinup> @AlcoholicBlackGuy You can absolutely murder people, but then you have to dispose of the body in an incinerator and it's a whooooole thing
[2:17:50] <+PleasantLeech> if you hold cargo in your hands and go to the back of the truck you can load it without using the menu
[2:17:55] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> oh yea completely forgot about that extremely important part of death in this game, damn murder really aint worth it

[2:24:59] <Jimbo0000> jesus
[2:25:00] <+Yagerme> Have you built all them roads.
[2:25:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOW THE SHIT ON YOUR BACK WON'T FIT
[2:25:04] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> use the postbox
[2:25:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> Have BB drive the other one
[2:25:08] <vVAstrAVv> all your back gear goes into the truck when you get in too. so you cant fill it completely

[2:25:33] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus If you got a PCC you can load up the extra into a postbox
[2:25:37] <Kghaleon> If you go too far you might despawn stuff
[2:25:38] <i_heart_gaming> then introduce a fourth truck to fast travel in between the trucks
[2:25:42] <Jathspuh> Things might despawn if you get out of range. idk
[2:25:43] <+CptBritches> Just get a big ole convoy truckin through the night
[2:25:48] <%Ancopro> mission materials getting to far away
[2:26:02] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> The truck master
[2:26:05] <+JacknZack27> Put the excess in a mailbox. If you get too far away it’ll despawn otherwise
[2:26:12] <i_heart_gaming> he is essentially using the trucks as a post box
[2:26:33] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He has to leaern the hard way
[2:26:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[2:26:36] <+PleasantLeech> the extra loot will just disappear in the truck
[2:26:48] <+linSP> stuff on vehicles is not protected from vanishing if you get really far away
[2:26:48] <red_blaster> Yeah, postbox is better for this
[2:26:51] <+CptBritches> Yeah being in a truck won't save it from despawning
[2:26:53] <sparkly_yoyo> There's something straight up PRIMAL about hoarding materials from a camp
[2:27:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> let him figure it out, better now than later in the game
[2:27:27] <i_heart_gaming> honestly he should just deposit the materials into a highway terminal. There is literally one right there by the craftsman
[2:27:43] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus Things in trucks despawn, you should use postboxes
[2:27:53] <+linSP> ceramics are my gold standard
[2:28:04] <red_blaster> Put everything in a postbox, not a truck
[2:28:06] <+D00msDayDan> i'm looking forward to the flood of too far from cargo messages
[2:28:06] <+Cymen90> "So it looks like you got enough materials here to make a whole highway......10 bucks is the best I can do for you and that's a favor!"
[2:28:20] <+therabbles> just drive both trucks tomatoBrain
[2:28:21] <Jimbo0000> TWO FULL TRUCKS
[2:28:22] <Haarute> is there a third truck?
[2:28:31] <+puffinup> i
[2:28:32] <bupkisoffthechain> Smart
[2:28:33] <red_blaster> yeyeye
[2:28:34] <+CptBritches> Just make a limo truck with both of them
[2:28:36] <Jathspuh> more greed than Pat
[2:28:44] <Jimbo0000> a v a r i c e
[2:28:49] <+puffinup> naw pat just did this offscreen lmao
[2:28:50] <Jathspuh> D:
[2:28:56] <darkbotle> drive the truck a bit, walk back to the second and drive that one and vice versa
[2:28:57] <ABigPinkLion> Oh thank god FeelsGoodMan
[2:29:04] <+puffinup> like literally this is how pat got the materials for all the highways
[2:29:16] <Jathspuh> i thought so lol
[2:29:21] <CursedNobleman> ahh, nothing like watching a game about porting junk to relax from my first playthrough of RE4
[2:29:28] <i_heart_gaming> he should also build a generator to charge the truck and his legs
[2:29:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> chat crisis averted
[2:29:35] <@SoushinSen> Yo dawg, i herd you liek trucks so i put a truck in your truck so you can truck while you truck
[2:29:55] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Yo wtf are these buildings lol
[2:29:57] <%Ancopro> you basically can
[2:30:02] <vVAstrAVv> trucks are soon dw
[2:30:02] <+Cymen90> You can just use the Postbox I think
[2:30:06] <+puffinup> oh god
[2:30:08] <+solzan2000> you can
[2:30:09] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> put it on the ground
[2:30:09] <Jathspuh> just use the post box
[2:30:10] <+berserker_103> go straight to the postbox, you can access the truck inside it
[2:30:12] <+solzan2000> he will find out
[2:30:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can direct transfer from vehicle to box
[2:30:16] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus use postbox menu
[2:30:18] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I thought it was just "small bridge" and "ladder"
[2:30:24] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Tranfer menu skips these steps
[2:30:38] <CursedNobleman> like a little box samurai making a little box flagstaff LUL
[2:30:52] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus you can access the truck from the postbox's private locker menu
[2:30:57] <+solzan2000> LUL
[2:30:58] <%Ancopro> ypu yup
[2:31:01] <+linSP> if a vehicle is close to a terminal itll show up with its cargo in its menu
[2:31:02] <+puffinup> yeyeyeeeeee
[2:31:10] <NotHereToStream> its proximity, you should pretty be in the middle to transfer items

[2:34:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> water the oldest foe of man
[2:35:02] <NotHereToStream> that area has no chiral network, so a bridge isn't feasable yet

[2:48:52] <Jathspuh> i'm a dingus
[2:49:02] <Kghaleon> The crater has a shit ton of loot as well, so he won't be able to take any of it.
[2:49:08] <Djinnazz> yup
[2:49:16] <+PleasantLeech> it's probably more than one pen
[2:49:22] <vVAstrAVv> back back back it up
[2:49:22] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going? hiw manu gallons of cum have we delivered today?

[2:49:54] <+PleasantLeech> @dan_g_v we talking real life or?
[2:49:55] <@SoushinSen> the preper's locker.
[2:49:56] <+Cymen90> The SHELTER has a private locker.
[2:50:01] <Kghaleon> Woolie isn't listening lol
[2:50:02] <+teamjflight> TRUCK LIVES MATTER
[2:50:06] <dan_g_v> both is ok!
[2:50:06] <red_blaster> The private locker in the shelter
[2:50:08] <+tuchpi> LUL
[2:50:08] <+GTCknight> The truck IS taking damage in the timefall
[2:50:42] <+heyitsdenzel_> @WoolieVersus Mortal Kombat is testing Krossplay on PS4 and Xbox
[2:50:43] <Aussie_Manny> So how far is Woolie into the game? 20%? 40%?
[2:50:51] <sparkly_yoyo> Like 10
[2:50:51] <NotHereToStream> chapter 3
[2:50:54] <vVAstrAVv> cheers for reggie
[2:51:04] <Aussie_Manny> @sparkly_yoyo Jeezus fuck.
[2:51:05] <i_heart_gaming> take some blood, piss, and cum with you too
[2:51:08] <Kghaleon> Woolie isn't out of tutorial until chapter 4.
[2:51:09] <tomdwarf> Chapter 3, so maybe about 20%?
[2:51:09] <dan_g_v> woolie is probably in the tutorial part
[2:51:13] <%Ancopro> you cant make one
[2:51:17] <sparkly_yoyo> it won't degrade
[2:51:19] <NotHereToStream> no despawn + protection out of timefall
[2:51:19] <%Ancopro> the netwrok
[2:51:20] <Djinnazz> Closer
[2:51:21] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can't build one, no network
[2:51:24] <i_heart_gaming> you can't make a locker right now because he is not on the chiral network
[2:51:27] <+D00msDayDan> postboxes are degraded by timefall
[2:51:28] <tomdwarf> Well, putting it in his means you dont need to make one.
[2:51:28] <red_blaster> Won't degrade
[2:51:29] <sparkly_yoyo> also no network
[2:51:41] <vVAstrAVv> saves a pcc lol
[2:51:43] <Djinnazz> CLOSER
[2:51:48] <red_blaster> Too far, you need to shove the truck in the door
[2:51:49] <+JacknZack27> You cant make a mailbox not on the network
[2:51:49] <Mothman742> is woolie gonna watch the game awards?
[2:51:50] <%supersugoisenpai1> Yes
[2:51:59] <%Ancopro> pcc's only work on the network
[2:51:59] <vVAstrAVv> he is
[2:52:11] <DagetStreams> Truck's gotta be facef*cking the shelter to pick up on the terminal, s' not great
[2:52:11] <+GTCknight> Need network to build
[2:52:12] <+solzan2000> everyone is watching it
[2:52:13] <tomdwarf> The network needs to be up to make any structure, including mailboxes.
[2:52:16] <Mothman742> sick thx for answering
[2:52:18] <%Ancopro> yup
[2:52:20] <i_heart_gaming> lol
[2:52:36] <+DarksideBluez> gonna need that truck for pizza
[2:52:37] <+JacknZack27> You have to be close enough
[2:52:41] <+PleasantLeech> still too far
[2:52:45] <i_heart_gaming> when your partner tell you inches don't matter point them to death stranding
[2:52:51] <red_blaster> Shelter private lockers won't degrade, so this stuff will always be avaiable to you on this shelter
[2:52:57] <%supersugoisenpai1> Place materials in locker too
[2:53:06] <i_heart_gaming> take grenades, ladders, and ropes
[2:53:10] <StrikingEarth> AW YEAH WE TRUCKIN
[2:53:21] <tomdwarf> Gee, could never tell :P
[2:53:24] <sparkly_yoyo> Attache Case HD
[2:53:35] <i_heart_gaming> dont ever work for UPS woolie
[2:54:10] <sparkly_yoyo> You're ready for this Woolie
[2:54:14] <gryffinp> Walk halfway across the country on foot and then hurl the crate at the shelter floor when you get there
[2:54:15] <chronoxgp> need cdl a
[2:54:16] <Aussie_Manny> As long as we're having fun, that's what matters. woolieCHAN
[2:54:34] <i_heart_gaming> lol
[2:54:37] <+DarksideBluez> this is not the darkest timeline
[2:54:43] <+GTCknight> Just wait for a fighting game where you have to do item management mid match
[2:54:45] <@SoushinSen> a fragile dystopia, but not that fragile
[2:54:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:54:48] <+teamjflight> LUL
[2:54:52] <Aussie_Manny> It's not awful and threatening, but it's not totally chill either. woolieHM
[2:54:52] <+solzan2000> oh this
[2:55:04] <+AbnormalVoid> jermaMoon
[2:55:10] <i_heart_gaming> its not the darkest timeline, its just an inconvenient timeline
[2:55:14] <tomdwarf> Yeah, containers take damage by hitting them. Ive broken stuff doing that :)
[2:55:18] <vVAstrAVv> not exciting? some tar monsters seem to disagree with that lol
[2:55:20] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, I remember this crater.
[2:55:23] <gryffinp> I don't know man, a world where you stay in your shelter all day, a man delivers the things you can't 3d print to your doorstep for no money, and you have chiral network access to get on the chiralnet? Sounds utopic to me.
[2:55:31] <Aussie_Manny> I snuck in. I didn't fucking truck in. LUL
[2:55:41] <%Ancopro> no truck for you
[2:55:51] <tomdwarf> Well, this'll be fun. Cant wait to see it.
[2:55:52] <+Grayhammatter> anti-truck walls
[2:55:55] <+PleasantLeech> the dead walking the earth and rain that kills you is a slow burn?
[2:55:56] <Aussie_Manny> We've got company~!
[2:56:01] <Kghaleon> Build a bunch of ladders so you can climb over the wall with your truck
[2:56:05] <+AbnormalVoid> this place is rough, I fought my first BT boss here
[2:56:07] <Psyramics> its a timeline where a person who dies in their apartment and doesn't get discovered could nuke the whole city
[2:56:11] <@SoushinSen> lol seven.
[2:56:16] <i_heart_gaming> this place is a bit rough
[2:56:17] <@SoushinSen> eight.
[2:56:19] <+Grayhammatter> eight
[2:56:23] <i_heart_gaming> save your heamitcs as a last resort
[2:56:32] <Aussie_Manny> @Kghaleon Does that work, like with two ladders for the wheels? PLEASE tell me that works! LUL
[2:56:36] <Kghaleon> @Psyramics That's why everyone has wrist monitors.
[2:56:41] <%Ancopro> you got this, just dont breathe ever
[2:56:43] <+DarksideBluez> rain can be avoided and so can the dead. The darkest timeline would be a place with no breathable oxygen and no drinkable water. This game has PIZZA.
[2:56:44] <tomdwarf> Honestly, I NEVER bothered with any of the EX grenades. I always just went with blood, kill them outright.
[2:56:44] <+shutup_meg> This is where I stopped when I last played. This place is rough.
[2:56:53] <bupkisoffthechain> @Psyramics no death doesnt cause an explosion, a live human has to be eaten by a BT to cause the voidout
[2:56:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> there is a good data collectible here
[2:57:03] <+PleasantLeech> @aussie_manny a truck will destroy ladders
[2:57:08] <i_heart_gaming> just ladder over
[2:57:14] <Aussie_Manny> You can't pee now! Don't take your dick out NOW! D:
[2:57:19] <+Cymen90> ?????????
[2:57:21] <+heyitsdenzel_> darkness imprisoning me
[2:57:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeee
[2:57:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> that one is good!
[2:57:42] <Psyramics> @bupkisoffthechain A BT in a population center is a guaranteed voidout. Every city on the eastern seaboard is a crater
[2:57:43] <Aussie_Manny> sneeki fucc
[2:57:47] <Kghaleon> Hope you brought lots of grenades
[2:57:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> Grenade time
[2:57:50] <worldbrand> pssssss
[2:57:55] <Solidnick18> throw blood
[2:57:55] <+Saltyjub> Mark your territory
[2:57:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> I only ever really used Bloodnades
[2:58:02] <bupkisoffthechain> Ya true @Psyramics
[2:58:23] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> okay rkells
[2:58:24] <+Cymen90> ???????
[2:58:32] <+shutup_meg> uh oh
[2:58:35] <+D00msDayDan> i see woolie forgot how to throw grenades
[2:58:38] <%supersugoisenpai1> It makes them move away
[2:58:38] <marvel877> Just got in, where is he at now?
[2:58:39] <+PleasantLeech> if you hold your breath you can walk right next to them
[2:58:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Literal waste of time. Non-blood is pointless
[2:58:50] <%Ancopro> oooooooh boy
[2:59:00] <tomdwarf> @GeneralSCPatton Eh, they
[2:59:03] <+Cymen90> just scan
[2:59:07] <Solidnick18> BT's ain't shit
[2:59:17] <tomdwarf> may find that out on their own. I stopped at about chapter 5 with anything other than blood.
[2:59:18] <Aussie_Manny> @marvel877 The crater where Fragile blew up a small city.
[2:59:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> think this is gonna win the VGA?
[2:59:23] <Jathspuh> who needs a ladder 4Head
[2:59:30] <i_heart_gaming> ghost: " bro, is this fucking piss, are you literally throwing fucking piss at me? NOT COOL"

[2:59:57] <vVAstrAVv> you only need to hold your breath when they find you or if youre going right under them
[2:59:58] <+JacknZack27> Drink some monster
[3:00:00] <Aussie_Manny> Switch out balls...
[3:00:07] <chronoxgp> sekiro should win

[3:01:33] <Aussie_Manny> HE CAN'T! IT'S RAINING!
[3:01:35] <NotHereToStream> pissing your pants would probably save your life at that point

[3:02:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> KILL GHOSTS, CLEAR PATH
[3:02:23] <+Cymen90> Just get used to eliminating threats
[3:02:39] <NotHereToStream> @PleasantLeech oh yeah, good point
[3:02:41] <+D00msDayDan> that one's lighter because it has 3 grenades left
[3:03:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> Anything equipped goes to tool rack
[3:03:11] <tomdwarf> Degredation doesnt reduce the weight of an item. Its lighter because each "Hermatic Grenade" is a pack. Each pack has 5 grenades, so the lighter one has less grenades.
[3:03:29] <Solidnick18> now get out
[3:03:43] <sparkly_yoyo> GREEED
[3:03:45] <vVAstrAVv> good luck carrying THAT

[3:04:25] <sparkly_yoyo> okay maybe grab one or two
[3:04:36] <i_heart_gaming> grab some metals and ceramics
[3:04:37] <+Grayhammatter> could take at least some
[3:04:41] <%Ancopro> greed is the name of the game
[3:04:44] <+CptBritches> Ceramics are worth taking
[3:04:48] <sparkly_yoyo> the smell of the game
[3:04:54] <tomdwarf> I also stopped bringing container repair spray later in the game, as I never tripped or fell on my missions.
[3:05:00] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:05:00] <i_heart_gaming> hahaha
[3:05:01] <+PleasantLeech> yeah
[3:05:01] <sparkly_yoyo> haha you were WEAK

[3:05:10] <+shutup_meg> LUL
[3:05:12] <+CptBritches> Hell yeahhhh
[3:05:15] <vVAstrAVv> GREED lol
[3:05:16] <Kghaleon> @tomdwarf It's for timefall damage
[3:05:20] <+CptBritches> Get the ceramics for sure
[3:05:27] <%Ancopro> ceramic and metal VERY important for road
[3:05:30] <+solzan2000> ^
[3:05:34] <+CptBritches> We doing it bros
[3:05:35] <Solidnick18> oof
[3:05:35] <i_heart_gaming> haha
[3:05:36] <worldbrand> he was not fine
[3:05:41] <gryffinp> GRAB IT AAAAAAAAAAALL
[3:05:42] <Solidnick18> you stacked
[3:05:43] <+CptBritches> Lmao
[3:05:49] <chronoxgp> woolie eyes
[3:05:53] <%supersugoisenpai1> You get gear later that lets you take EVERYTHING
[3:05:54] <+teamjflight> take it all tbh
[3:05:55] <tomdwarf> I know, but Timefall only damages a container, not the actual health of anything. If you dont trip or fall, you get perfect score for the delivery.
[3:05:57] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:06:06] <+CptBritches> Maybe hold one of them in your hands
[3:06:12] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Consider shortscuts
[3:06:19] <tomdwarf> Contrainer repair spray also doesnt repair tools such as grenades, ladders, etc. So yeah, I stopped using them.
[3:06:20] <%Ancopro> you can do it
[3:06:23] <i_heart_gaming> you can put up ladders and ropes in this area if needed
[3:06:31] <Solidnick18> just avoid all dem bt's
[3:06:50] <+Cymen90> @Solidnick18 Nah. Kill and take materials
[3:06:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> Throw it, they'll be destroyed soon anyway
[3:07:09] <Kghaleon> @tomdwarf Pretty sure timefall damages both, and there's no way to avoid timefall except with vehicles or timefall shelters.
[3:07:21] <Solidnick18> @Cymen90 i would just get caught and fight them so they all go away
[3:07:32] <sparkly_yoyo> You must have literal tons of cargo
[3:07:34] <%Ancopro> i love this heel turn into greed
[3:07:34] <sparkly_yoyo> Feel good
[3:07:38] <+PleasantLeech> you can always recycle them
[3:08:00] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[3:08:01] <Solidnick18> oh no that drop

[3:09:08] <tomdwarf> @Kghaleon. When I played, it ONLY damaged container health, not material health. Unless it was patched, you dont explicitly need it. container spray is if your worried about mistakes.

[3:12:27] <+linSP> "fuck your internet. is that my screwdriver? im in"
[3:12:28] <%Ancopro> YES
[3:12:30] <%supersugoisenpai1> Bola rules
[3:12:33] <+AbnormalVoid> bola gun is the shit
[3:12:36] <i_heart_gaming> Canada: Land of the living, and the still living
[3:12:38] <Solidnick18> that's a good thing to have
[3:12:38] <ShmowzowKapow> GUN
[3:12:39] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[3:12:52] <Dementedpenguin> The best weapon in the game, in my opinion.
[3:12:54] <vVAstrAVv> mules are now completely trivial
[3:13:03] <+tuchpi> wtf cmonBruh
[3:13:04] <i_heart_gaming> this is the best weapon in the game
[3:13:11] <gryffinp> ALL PORTERS ARE BASTARDS
[3:13:12] <+CptBritches> Yeah the bola gun is ridiculous
[3:13:14] <+Cymen90> WTF cmonBruh
[3:13:16] <Graxe_> SOP?
[3:13:19] <+AbnormalVoid> do you even run into regular porters who are terrorists?
[3:13:19] <i_heart_gaming> ebola gun too good
[3:13:23] <+GTCknight> No currency in the apocalypse is the best thing about a apocalypse
[3:13:28] <%Ancopro> why did he look at himself he can't see the hologram
[3:13:35] <%redrins> ebola gun GET
[3:13:44] <tomdwarf> Yeah, bolas weapons are great. I stuck with Non-lethal assault rifles, just because you can headshot knock out targets, without having to run up and kick the target.
[3:13:47] <+D00msDayDan> incoming ebola jokes
[3:13:50] <+DarksideBluez> currency is a Cain concept. dude killed his bro
[3:13:56] <Graxe_> Sons of the Patriots?
[3:14:04] <itesket> A bola deez nuts
[3:14:07] <NotHereToStream> only lvl 2 bola
[3:14:07] <+Grayhammatter> what!
[3:14:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> You could kill someone with a bola gun I'm sure
[3:14:09] <+Proxzo> Headshots with Bola Gun is like head shots with Tranq dart @WoolieVersus
[3:14:10] <Dementedpenguin> The BEST gun.
[3:14:20] <chronoxgp> embibe with YOUR BLOOD
[3:14:24] <zil_nine> I know it's off topic but opinion on Leroy Smith? @WoolieVersus
[3:14:38] <Prevot> PogChamp
[3:14:38] <+linSP> bola gun doesnt knock out mules if you hit them below the neck, gotta kick em
[3:14:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Headshot is knockout. Bodyshot ties them up, but they can be kicked for knockout.
[3:14:56] <i_heart_gaming> make sure you knowck out people that get hit by ebola or else they will get back up
[3:14:58] <+Grayhammatter> god, that's so tiny
[3:14:59] <tomdwarf> Ah, thanks. I legit didnt realize that.
[3:15:06] <%Ancopro> so make sure you get a clear shot
[3:15:15] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Ammo for it refills in safehouse
[3:15:20] <NotHereToStream> lvl 2, just level this guy up
[3:15:24] <%Ancopro> na its just automatic
[3:15:31] <Solidnick18> lvl 2 bola gun is great
[3:15:34] <tomdwarf> No, the blood ammo is automatic. No need to make the ammo
[3:15:40] <%Ancopro> do it
[3:15:43] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus bola gun has blood ammo built in
[3:15:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> Go raid a MULE camp
[3:15:54] <+Proxzo> You can do head shots with it
[3:15:54] <i_heart_gaming> use it on mules
[3:15:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:16:04] <vVAstrAVv> time to bulli the muleys
[3:16:11] <+Proxzo> it's a fun aiming style too
[3:16:12] <Solidnick18> Find a mule and test it
[3:16:43] <i_heart_gaming> he should spend the next 30 minutes building rodes with the materials he got
[3:16:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> If you don't headshot, then you have to kick them afterwards
[3:16:56] <%supersugoisenpai1> It aims like the plasma cutter in Dead Space
[3:16:57] <worldbrand> you getp lenty of rounds
[3:17:02] <NotHereToStream> well thankfully you don't have to wait too long to test it out
[3:17:04] <chronoxgp> hang on rool rack

[3:18:29] <gryffinp> wow
[3:18:29] <+Grayhammatter> he needs a better skeleton though
[3:18:42] <Solidnick18> you gotta upgrade the station
[3:18:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> USE HOT SPRING
[3:18:45] <Kghaleon> Get the level 3 skeleton...it's like 310kg
[3:18:45] <NotHereToStream> hot spring close to replenish your shit
[3:18:46] <%supersugoisenpai1> Deliver to the Engineer for better skeleton
[3:18:50] <i_heart_gaming> to upgrade the skeleton just do a couple of deliveries for the engineer, the manga guy
[3:18:58] <+tuchpi> do more shit for Engineer
[3:19:07] <+linSP> get junji up to four stars at least
[3:19:11] <NotHereToStream> you get better equipment if you deliver more to the preppers that initially provided you with the level 1 item
[3:19:11] <vVAstrAVv> get upgrades by leveling up whoever gave you the item
[3:19:16] <gamewarden92> hot spring?
[3:19:17] <+JacknZack27> You have to do extra deliveries to get upgrades
[3:19:19] <+PleasantLeech> get more stars with Junji ito
[3:19:26] <i_heart_gaming> the same thing with ebola gun, do more stuff for this guy
[3:19:34] <worldbrand> nah it's further east

[3:30:10] <sparkly_yoyo> I'd say it's time to store the truck
[3:30:18] <+tuchpi> or store it
[3:30:19] <@Solidus_113> go to Mule Camp and steal back their stuff
[3:30:22] <i_heart_gaming> you have to go the mule camp, take the system server and deliver it back
[3:30:28] <sparkly_yoyo> ?
[3:30:29] <+DarksideBluez> if you throw sperm grenade in enemy's face is that considered a MONEY SHOT?
[3:30:31] <sparkly_yoyo> wait you can't?
[3:30:36] <i_heart_gaming> backup truck is there remember
[3:30:40] <sparkly_yoyo> Oh well
[3:30:42] <Solidnick18> i don't think you can store trucks
[3:30:50] <+tuchpi> you can only store bridges trucks
[3:30:55] <Chaoko99> So as we know, JUMP FORCE is on the nominations for best fighting game.
[3:31:09] <Chaoko99> Is this because of the few fighting games that came out this year or is it actually secretly good
[3:31:14] <NotHereToStream> few
[3:31:17] <sparkly_yoyo> Jump Force doesn't even have Arale, what a scam
[3:31:18] <+DarksideBluez> veyr few
[3:31:20] <+tuchpi> meme nominations
[3:31:30] <NotHereToStream> next year is gonna be good since GBVS and GG Strive
[3:31:33] <%Ancopro> the kill la kill one would be better than jumpforce
[3:31:55] <i_heart_gaming> doesnt kill la kill only have like 10 playable characters?
[3:32:10] <sparkly_yoyo> the game awards lack thuggery
[3:32:11] <vVAstrAVv> hope outer wilds wins something. it deserves a bumb or ten
[3:32:16] <Chaoko99> almost heaven
[3:32:18] <+tuchpi> WHY
[3:32:25] <+Bob_Tom> tactical void outs
[3:32:29] <laguerrilha> we trucking PogChamp
[3:32:29] <Solidnick18> not the water
[3:32:30] <chaos2frozen> No Woolie, that causes Voidouts

[3:42:40] <sparkly_yoyo> Sam Porter Bridges has never killed anyone
[3:42:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> There's a limit of how much actual stuff you can have on you.
[3:42:48] <+ShanaEchidna> use the truck @woolieversus
[3:42:48] <%Ancopro> that will be VERY interesting later
[3:42:51] <Chaoko99> It's a shame there's a height limit
[3:42:54] <Chaoko99> Because imagine like

[3:43:02] <Chaoko99> a big wobbly Astral Chain tower of boxes
[3:43:06] <+Proxzo> can you get a new truck?
[3:43:07] <i_heart_gaming> there is a volume and weight limit
[3:43:11] <+ShanaEchidna> you can load stuff in the back of the truck
[3:43:11] <Chaoko99> did anyone actually manage to get the fuckin' icecream thing done
[3:43:12] <i_heart_gaming> you just hit the volume limit
[3:43:17] <D3rrtyD4n> its working

[3:45:56] <Chaoko99> I don't name things but I like to refer to inanimate objects as friends. It's really weird because people catch me talking to the computers while I fix them at work.
[3:45:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @namillus My work is 20 miles away, either I drive for half an hour or take an hour to an hour and a half with public transit.
[3:46:06] <i_heart_gaming> oh look, its good ol not rusty truck, superior to good ol rusty
[3:46:19] <sparkly_yoyo> Greed
[3:46:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> That truck looks like a Frank to me.
[3:46:20] <+Bob_Tom> if you're close enough you can scan them with the odradecck
[3:46:23] <+Yagerme> doogNo doogNo doogNo
[3:46:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm gonna call Woolie's truck Frank from now on.
[3:46:31] <Chaoko99> Man, that truck is so much nicer than my current car
[3:46:47] <sparkly_yoyo> You can use that shit to build roads, yo!
[3:46:49] <@Solidus_113> Put all these ceramics into the roads
[3:46:54] <+solzan2000> ^
[3:46:58] <renegadorade> Those trucks dont't hold as much as bridges Trucks
[3:47:00] <Kghaleon> By end game I realized I had collected tons of loot and never used any of it. Elixirs man.
[3:47:00] <NotHereToStream> metals and ceremics and chiral crystals
[3:47:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ceramics and Metals = Roads.
[3:47:11] <sparkly_yoyo> Also chiral crystals
[3:47:15] <i_heart_gaming> PRO TIPS: if you drive 1 truck up to another truck, you can transfer stuff in between truck A and truck B
[3:47:28] <sparkly_yoyo> Roads need a little chiral for the evil effect
[3:47:48] <+Yagerme> I been warned for to many emotes. I never heard of such a thing.
[3:48:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Thank you everyone to Woolie learns logistics.
[3:48:06] <imabooterfly> we TRUCKIN now
[3:48:06] <+Grayhammatter> and then just truck
[3:48:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wow that was english, me.
[3:48:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Rusty Frank.
[3:48:23] <RyuuAoi> @yagerme MOOBOT is a bitch... SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[3:48:33] <i_heart_gaming> can we call this next truck UMVC 3? the new hotness?

[3:48:55] <Kghaleon> Thank god Woolie is streaming this, rip youtube people
[3:48:56] <taptapmuhgap> WAAAAAAAAAAGH!
[3:48:59] <+Yagerme> Watch out you might get a warning ⚠️
[3:49:04] <Chaoko99> SUPER. TRUCK.
[3:49:09] <Neathergrasp> Who else is exited about torotoro sfm?
[3:49:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> I really just want Woolie to bump a rock and the truck to be disabled.
[3:49:12] <+heyitsdenzel_> Monster Truck
[3:49:19] <RyuuAoi> Fuck trucks
[3:49:20] <vVAstrAVv> woolie just drive the NEW truck closer lol
[3:49:29] <sparkly_yoyo> DS has made a lot of QOL stuff that everyone should copy
[3:49:35] <Chaoko99> Anyone else wish there was another superhot
[3:49:38] <+Yagerme> Hit it from behind
[3:49:44] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[3:49:48] <Chaoko99> It's sure a shame that superhot has pretty much just become a powerup in other games
[3:49:51] <RyuuAoi> Quality of life
[3:49:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> At least ONE person will get into logistical engineering because of this game.
[3:49:56] <NotHereToStream> alright lets get this out on to a tra
[3:49:57] <sparkly_yoyo> you can drive it off a ramp
[3:49:58] <$laphyrion> How much inventory can YOU sort within the stopped time?
[3:50:00] <omid97> deathstranding very good sund trak
[3:50:03] <i_heart_gaming> leave the old shitty truck there for the mules to use later.
[3:50:03] <Chaoko99> super
[3:50:08] <Crashfan01> hot

[3:51:05] <+Proxzo> Woolie YOUTUBE
[3:51:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[3:51:08] <sparkly_yoyo> The way from the wind farm's called Jake Wind
[3:51:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Subtlety is for cowards = Kojima
[3:51:12] <sparkly_yoyo> guy*
[3:51:28] <NotHereToStream> i believe the yellow lines are the built high way
[3:51:31] <+Bob_Tom> you got the server
[3:51:33] <sparkly_yoyo> To be fair, that's how name works: Smith, Miller, Farmer, etc
[3:51:45] <+Proxzo> Your System Server item is on your truck, so you good
[3:52:01] <+Yagerme> It took me two days to build every part of them dang roads. But it made my life easier.
[3:52:07] <vVAstrAVv> stop looking at the map and truck already
[3:52:12] <omid97> how is Emily
[3:52:12] <+heyitsdenzel_> roll out
[3:52:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yagerme I literally spent a whole day just building every single road on this map.
[3:52:22] <+D00msDayDan> is his plan to jump off the end of the road?
[3:52:23] <D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[3:52:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yagerme I also built out a zipline circuit to every single drop-off point
[3:52:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:52:56] <+Cymen90> IF ONLY there was a way to complete the bridge
[3:53:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Cymen90 No, it's impossible.
[3:53:08] <D3rrtyD4n> you can cross that small stream
[3:53:21] <%Ancopro> no no thats a good road
[3:53:33] <NotHereToStream> that road is safe
[3:53:37] <DedlokPM> yeah a LOT of last names are from when they decided that the right to a last name was not just a thing for nobles. So a lot of them were just adapted versions of their job titles
[3:53:55] <D3rrtyD4n> oh boy
[3:53:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get on that road dammit.
[3:53:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> AAAAGH
[3:54:04] <+linSP> cursed roads
[3:54:08] <DedlokPM> So if your last name is Cooper, at some point someone in your family line was a barrel maker
[3:54:12] <D3rrtyD4n> you can use that highway
[3:54:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie don't be like this, okay phew.
[3:54:21] <mdkcde> Trukkin'
[3:54:22] <+Grayhammatter> that road is complete
[3:54:32] <+Proxzo> BUS
[3:54:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie the Canadian confused by roads.
[3:54:39] <sparkly_yoyo> In Spanish there's the name Verdugo, which means Executioner. Heavy family history I guess.
[3:54:41] <D3rrtyD4n> its complete
[3:54:42] <+Bob_Tom> bridges and trucks are kinda janky
[3:54:43] <i_heart_gaming> now boost!
[3:54:44] <D3rrtyD4n> yup
[3:54:47] <%Ancopro> yea
[3:54:50] <@Solidus_113> chiral asphalt
[3:54:51] <+Bob_Tom> yep
[3:54:51] <+future_ry> yeah roads are evil as fuck
[3:54:53] <sparkly_yoyo> yeah its the chirals
[3:54:57] <+Cymen90> BOOST
[3:54:57] <taptapmuhgap> If you have the last name smith there is a large chance you had a military person in yo family line who didn't have a last name
[3:54:58] <NotHereToStream> looks cool to me
[3:55:00] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Chiral roads bro
[3:55:01] <DedlokPM> Yes they all have that floating particle stuff
[3:55:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus These are LITERALLY 3D Printer ROads.
[3:55:06] <Chaoko99> The roads are like that because Chiralium has antigravity things.
[3:55:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> **Printed
[3:55:09] <+JacknZack27> You can click in the stick to go faster
[3:55:11] <vVAstrAVv> just the overpasses
[3:55:15] <@Solidus_113> now build this first stretch of road
[3:55:15] <DedlokPM> It's a side effect from being made with Chiral shit
[3:55:16] <mdkcde> trukkin'
[3:55:17] <+Yagerme> I wasn’t walking with mama. I drove her ass and she still (no spoilers) lol.
[3:55:23] <%Ancopro> yea boost only on road
[3:55:25] <+linSP> you can L3 gun it on roads for free
[3:55:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Yagerme I used that Zipline network I was talking about.
[3:55:32] <+Bob_Tom> also, only the light grey center strip is the energy zone
[3:55:35] <i_heart_gaming> boosting is good on roads because it doesn't use batteries
[3:55:35] <RyuuAoi> Get yo kicks on route 23!
[3:55:36] <D3rrtyD4n> row adds
[3:55:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> The whole trip took me 7 minutes.

[3:56:14] <$laphyrion> Maaaaaan, not looking forward to when I have to rework my zipline network.
[3:56:22] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Why'd he get out?
[3:56:23] <i_heart_gaming> the convoy song was too powerful for mortal gears
[3:56:32] <%Ancopro> can;t store mule trucks
[3:56:32] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cause he's a good christian boy
[3:56:33] <RyuuAoi> Woolie is high......
[3:56:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> I actually used to listen to that song on old casette tapes with my grandpa, it tripped me out when Futurama played it.
[3:56:35] <@Solidus_113> Just means you can't store Mule Trucks
[3:56:39] <+solzan2000> ^
[3:56:43] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> ^^
[3:56:44] <NotHereToStream> you can deliver to the terminal, don't have to grab it
[3:56:45] <+GarbageNirvana> Can't stash mule trucks
[3:56:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mule trucks are verbotem.
[3:56:47] <vVAstrAVv> closer to terminal
[3:56:54] <RyuuAoi> Truckin' high again!
[3:57:02] <+heyitsdenzel_> black and yellow is evil
[3:57:07] <%Ancopro> they're like SAM not in MY house
[3:57:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> That truck was used by Magic Johnson, no one wants to touch it
[3:57:13] <i_heart_gaming> that truck has the bad likes, you need the trucks with the good likes
[3:57:31] <renegadorade> Nah MAn thats OJ's Truck
[3:57:41] <+tuchpi> HONDA LUL
[3:57:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @renegadorade It has the combined blood of OJ's wife and Magic Johnson.
[3:58:16] <+kukadin> last week I had a truck with three yellow lit up crucifixes attached to the grill behind me on the freeway at night
[3:58:17] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:58:54] <+kukadin> @CommanderSqueaks no I was too overcome by the fear of god
[3:59:02] <+Bob_Tom> FITNESS GRAM PACER TEST
[3:59:05] <+GarbageNirvana> Elon Musk demonstrating his timefall-proof cybertruck by driving it in the rain and it falls apart around him
[3:59:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> I just imagine a firmware update bricking your cyber truck's bios and having to reformat your truck OS.
[3:59:33] <worldbrand> puzzle! bois!
[3:59:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait what I said made no sense.

[4:01:34] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Look at all that bandwith to BUILD SHIT WITH :D
[4:01:44] <vVAstrAVv> now BUILD THOSE ROAADS
[4:01:45] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus you can paint your gear and vehicles in private room, at least some of them
[4:01:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> There is a very special vehicle which is why you want to get every Memory Chip you can find. It's VERY special.
[4:02:04] <NotHereToStream> it makes you feel cool
[4:02:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> Damn robots, they took our jerbs
[4:02:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> So cool.
[4:02:32] <Holgast> @CommanderSqueaks LuL
[4:02:39] <vVAstrAVv> does it make you as cool as if you were on ride with norman reeus?
[4:02:49] <+JingKaisean> oh shit
[4:02:58] <+JingKaisean> the thing is here
[4:02:58] <vVAstrAVv> i honestly dont know
[4:02:59] <MichaelDood> @vvastravv I certainly hope so.
[4:02:59] <i_heart_gaming> but she gon cry
[4:03:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> Jumping does tire her out a bit
[4:03:12] <+Grayhammatter> are we gonna be on ride with norman reedus?
[4:03:16] <Kghaleon> but cutscenes tho
[4:03:17] <vVAstrAVv> i found like 2 memory chips total lpl
[4:03:18] <langdonalgar> It literally takes effort
[4:03:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @WoolieVersus Also, just so you haven't figured it out, you can totally pee on the BT's and it has the same effect of a piss grenade.
[4:03:45] <+Jasek7> caht what chapter we at?
[4:03:56] <vVAstrAVv> pat told him dw
[4:03:56] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus And the crater
[4:03:59] <@Solidus_113> Take those Metals and Ceramics and build the first road with it
[4:04:02] <+tuchpi> NotLikeThis
[4:04:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie has no discovered what the true anxiety of this game is.
[4:04:05] <sparkly_yoyo> yeah but you have roads
[4:04:05] <%Ancopro> itll stay there whenever you're good to get it
[4:04:05] <Louie_Salmon> Lotta TRUCKIN' to do.
[4:04:08] <+JingKaisean> is the pee actually effective? I've never killed a BT with the piss or shit grenades
[4:04:08] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can grab it on the way to the next distro center
[4:04:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> **Has now discovered
[4:04:12] <+Grayhammatter> the crater had so much stuff too
[4:04:13] <worldbrand> the mules wont have respawned that quickly, i dont think
[4:04:14] <Prevot> NotLikeThis
[4:04:22] <D3rrtyD4n> they dont respawn that fast
[4:04:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @JingKaisean you can't kill them with it, but it disorients and dissuades them.
[4:04:28] <%Ancopro> crater is easy now that you got the chiral going on though
[4:04:29] <vVAstrAVv> woolie thats too much greed pump the breaks lol
[4:04:33] <Dementedpenguin> @Jasek7 3
[4:04:43] <NotHereToStream> don't forget to deliver to upgrade your equipment
[4:04:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jingkaisean Only blood-based weapons can actually kill them.
[4:04:47] <Louie_Salmon> Also the mules stay defeated for a good while, so it shouldn't be too bad.
[4:04:51] <i_heart_gaming> building roads makes greed easier
[4:04:51] <+Jasek7> @Dementedpenguin oooooof
[4:05:01] <+linSP> hit those mules with a sturdy case of CERAMICS

[4:15:39] <+saltpiggu> @WoolieVersus streaming on Thursday nights is already a death sentence because critical role streams on thursdays
[4:15:44] <peachy996> So JUMP FORCE got nominated but Battle for The Grid didn't
[4:15:45] <smugjorgen98> does game awards use GGPO

[4:16:16] <MahoganyWoods> @Cymen90 Don't need it with GGPO. Without it that 10k player base may as well be 10.
[4:16:17] <Louie_Salmon> I'm so worried about the "games come alive" theme. Crash bandicoot is gonna walk out of the screen and do a fortnite

[4:18:48] <$laphyrion> Watch it be Frisk.
[4:19:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @laphyrion Naw eat shit (not really), make it Chara.
[4:19:09] <EnvyLeviathan_> goku for smash
[4:19:09] <Louie_Salmon> I really hope they fake us out with the smash reveal. Have like 10 characters almost get the invite like the Terry trailer
[4:19:10] <MichaelDood> Or Andores lies.
[4:19:11] <worldbrand> yknow im kinda surprised they never added any items as dlc
[4:19:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> No! Frisk and their final smash is they're taken over by Chara and just do a single stab.
[4:19:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:19:53] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> You know what.I hope there isn't a SINGLE smash announcement during the awards just out of pure spite.
[4:20:05] <+wardenofwinter> @WoolieVersus i mean Babylon falls looks like aster chains was meant to be
[4:20:08] <gunsrlove> WAIT....Astral CHAIN?
[4:20:12] <gunsrlove> Chains connect us
[4:20:14] <gunsrlove> like strands
[4:20:28] <gunsrlove> Is Astral Chain THE FIRST STRAND GAME?
[4:20:39] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> What did Kojimbo mean by this?
[4:20:41] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Apparently Astral Chain was supposed to be Babylon's Fall
[4:20:42] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus New FF7 Trailer dyring Preshow at 5:30 PM PT
[4:20:49] <DXLelouch24> during*
[4:20:51] <Ipsenscastle> Knuckles Chaotix was the first strand game
[4:20:55] <worldbrand> i kinda wish the map was larger and more varied in automata
[4:20:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Astral Chain says Slavery is GREAT" - Woolie Madden probably.
[4:20:58] <vicious_rage> If XQC still lived in Canada I'd push him for the podcast.
[4:21:02] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Yo word @DXLelouch24
[4:21:12] <worldbrand> but at the same time im glad it mostly stuck to doin its action rpg stuff
[4:21:13] <+saladin1911> I still have not played Automata. I should probably do that soon
[4:21:18] <+JingKaisean> woolie, are you gonna eat on stream?
[4:21:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can understand why, Automata is a beast.
[4:21:25] <$laphyrion> If you think about it, Legions are just really big armored Bridge Babies.
[4:21:26] <smugjorgen98> @gunsrlove no astral chain is the first austrailia related game
[4:21:29] <%supersugoisenpai1> supersugoisenpai1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! The text in DS is kind of small, but nothing can be as bad as playing Dead Rising before I owned an HD TV. The text was so small and blurry, it actually could not be read.
[4:21:31] <%supersugoisenpai1> supersugoisenpai1's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat!

[4:22:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie gets paid in exposure for the Naruto videos.
[4:22:24] <+Cymen90> Smash should win BEST FIGHTING GAME. At least it has more features than Multiplayer and Arcade.
