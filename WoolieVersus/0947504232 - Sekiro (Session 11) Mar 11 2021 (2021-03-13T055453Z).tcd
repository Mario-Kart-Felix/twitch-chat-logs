[0:01:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> to Minh yeah
[0:01:09] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Yeah getting aggressive is actually a viable tactic
[0:01:12] <huskarl_zap> woolieVS_RB
[0:01:17] <420mangojuice> !uptime
[0:01:23] <%buff_shiba> I think you should just flail wildly.
[0:01:25] <ullyzeez> aggressive is the way to play this game tho
[0:01:28] <HelghastTroop> best strategy swing once deflect repeat Kappa
[0:01:32] <@akuda_bar> @CanadianAnimatorGuy to vergil
[0:01:40] <%MooseIsGoose> @BurncoatRapscallion That was my most used tactic in my playthrough
[0:01:41] <420mangojuice> deflect is the new roll
[0:01:43] <vVAstrAVv> best strat is jump :3
[0:02:01] <%buff_shiba> buff_shiba subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Looking forward to the stream dude
[0:02:14] <ullyzeez> i mean it worked :)
[0:02:17] <HelghastTroop> i had no idea that you can deflect thrust attacks on my fisrt play of this game
[0:02:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You back off quite a bit compared to most people, but it worked out
[0:02:24] <HelghastTroop> i thought the counter was only way
[0:02:33] <%krispen_wa> Thats your answer, but Chipp's Answer is a ninja
[0:02:38] <%kullumanati> Cringe jumping incoming
[0:02:41] <420mangojuice> it took a while to get used to sekiro for me too
[0:02:51] <@Menitta> If it works it works
[0:03:02] <%0rond> @HelghastTroop one fault sekiro has is inconsistancy, some can be, some can't same for soem grabs and sweeps
[0:03:07] <%ECRead> I used the feather tool. feather tool rules
[0:03:07] <+bunchaghosts> ani-johns?

[0:05:37] <dizimous> That's a lotta emblems
[0:05:41] <+Zaedum> broke my elite controller playing this game. not anger just wear and tear.
[0:05:45] <@Solidus_113> 503 emblems
[0:05:51] <%0rond> thankfully sekiro doesn't really have stats to grind
[0:05:51] <Nyckelus> Woolie has become the Pat.
[0:05:52] <HelghastTroop> woolie grinded off screen like a coward Kappa

[0:08:45] <+bunchaghosts> area is beautiful
[0:09:13] <+Sperbus> Hahahaha the underwater here is... yeah
[0:09:14] <HelghastTroop> i like how bandai is too embaressed to saying anything on the elden ring leak
[0:09:23] <%RyTYoung> I always forget this game has underwater sword fighting, it's so fucking RAW
[0:09:23] <NHTreace> elden ring looks so good
[0:09:25] <convo445> can't imagine trying to make a blind Elden Ring playthrough without everyone going crazy on missing stuff
[0:09:35] <+Sperbus> They're more snake than monkey
[0:09:43] <NHTreace> cominghomeWhoa monkeys
[0:09:45] <%krispen_wa> Alright chat, best soulsbourne that isn't a Fromsoft game or Nioh
[0:09:47] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Yeah they're like snakes or catfish
[0:09:48] <huskarl_zap> MONKY GANG
[0:09:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @convo445 so basically every lp
[0:09:51] <+Zaedum> i thought they were fish people
[0:09:56] <ullyzeez> hollow knight@krispen_wa
[0:09:57] <%hax_metatron> Woolie knows he can block arrows right?
[0:09:58] <HelghastTroop> @convo445 its fromsoft game why wouldnt you expect major handholding in chat
[0:10:03] <NHTreace> robat aliens from venus
[0:10:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> someone will always go crazy about missing stuff
[0:10:12] <DSD24> @krispen_wa Surge 2 was pretty fun actually
[0:10:13] <Nyckelus> Code: Vein is one that I particularly like.
[0:10:22] <@Menitta> Surge 2 is fire
[0:10:23] <convo445> some dudes are more chill on missing stuff on their first playthrough
[0:10:28] <samazam94> just because its expected doesnt mean its okay
[0:10:49] <NHTreace> im so fuckin hyped from KH3 on PC witha uncapped FPS
[0:10:50] <HelghastTroop> how is mortal shell btw dont know nothing about that game
[0:10:55] <NHTreace> for*
[0:11:02] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Oh shit he's going for this guy
[0:11:06] <DSD24> Code Vein certainly has the best character creator
[0:11:19] <%krispen_wa> Bro, imagine modded KH3 where you get to play as the best character Roxas for the whole game on PC Kreygasm
[0:11:23] <%sporeian94> Fuck these enemies what the actual fuck where they thinking
[0:11:27] <convo445> but CSB is squarly mounted on one done deal playthroughs
[0:11:31] <+BurncoatRapscallion> This guy is actually pretty easy I think
[0:11:42] <ullyzeez> sick
[0:11:45] <Aydarkzero> Fear going up monkaS
[0:11:55] <NHTreace> @krispen_wa You know people are gonna snap with the kingdom hearts mods
[0:11:58] <+almightychad> Woolie got spooked
[0:12:01] <DSD24> Wow that is so much damage
[0:12:02] <@Menitta> I really hope that new game by the Code Vein team is good. Scarlet Nexus
[0:12:05] <+Mendin> The Spookum Beam
[0:12:07] <+b_aleph> use the umbrella
[0:12:07] <ullyzeez> rip
[0:12:09] <+Zaedum> you can deflect the terror beam
[0:12:19] <Aydarkzero> d e t h
[0:12:22] <HelghastTroop> mortal shell is ashort game from what ive been told
[0:12:23] <+bunchaghosts> Bunchaghost balls
[0:12:27] <%ZweihanderSteve> damn was a laser
[0:12:27] <artoflec> scarlet nexus is the vesperia team not code vein team i thought
[0:12:27] <DSD24> Scarlet Nexus is that Xbox Exclusive right?
[0:12:33] <Nyckelus> @menitta Yeah. I just need to see more gameplay before I get invested any further.
[0:12:35] <%krispen_wa> i keep forgetting, is scarlet nexus actually by the god eater team or are you memeing
[0:12:38] <@Menitta> @DSD24 naw its on everything
[0:12:38] <ExpressNode> Just played Final Fantasy 13 on my Xbox SX. That game looked like it could have came out on PS4 or XBone a few years ago instead of ten
[0:12:42] <%sirisvirus> ya strangely enough you can parry it as well
[0:12:43] <ullyzeez> ninja tools bro the feather thing helps
[0:12:48] <quamdunk> Umbrella with the upgrade really evens grounds
[0:12:51] <@Menitta> Its by the Code Vein/God Eater/Tales Of team
[0:12:57] <DSD24> @Menitta Oh cool thanks for clarifying!
[0:13:04] <+Mendin> You need Androids 17 and 18
[0:13:05] <the_extra_> No you don't need the Lapis Lazuli
[0:13:10] <+Zaedum> deflect with your sword, terror beam is no problem for your sword deflect
[0:13:10] <HelghastTroop> lapis lazuli best girl of steven universe
[0:13:11] <NHTreace> KH3 will looks like jusus at 144+ fps I just hope it runs ohkay and doesnt come with some forced on TAA or other post processing
[0:13:17] <420mangojuice> is sekiro is the hardest souls game this is the only one i havent finished
[0:13:20] <%krispen_wa> I cant believe they made an amazing character creator but then madr Scarlet Nexus the game where you play as bland fuccboi
[0:13:23] <Aydarkzero> @ExpressNode it's really did look great
[0:13:37] <quamdunk> @mendin *badumtsss*
[0:13:37] <%sporeian94> Woolie you just go ham on him and he gets stunned
[0:13:40] <@Menitta> you play as two characters in Scarlet
[0:13:45] <convo445> there's usually some tool or technique that helps out but we don't got the time to experiment
[0:13:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:13:46] <%Lion_kun> Spam the terror gourd
[0:13:55] <artoflec> i only ever find information that's it by former Tales studios developers that branched off
[0:13:56] <%krispen_wa> @420mangojuice the hardest game is your first. but yeah sekiro is hardest
[0:13:57] <DSD24> @krispen_wa There's no way that game won't have a character creator or at least some form of customization
[0:13:59] <Equirah> @DSD24 @Menitta not that team, it's the Sword Art team
[0:14:01] <%sporeian94> What ending is Woolie going for?
[0:14:04] <Nyckelus> @420mangojuice It‚Äôs considered one of the toughest.
[0:14:10] <convo445> the true one
[0:14:19] <@Menitta> Ah ok. Well whoever's making it, it looks cool
[0:14:22] <vVAstrAVv> if he has the ceremonial tanto he at least killed 1
[0:14:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> There's only like two in the whole game
[0:14:42] <%sporeian94> There's 2 of the Schimen and 4 headless
[0:14:47] <artoflec> being from tales developers is one of the main reasons im interested in scarlet nexus because they get how to make some interesting combat stuff.
[0:14:50] <Aydarkzero> round two
[0:15:13] <NHTreace> Did u guys see the Ninja Gidden collection is gonna be on PC
[0:15:29] <HelghastTroop> oh is it really
[0:15:34] <HelghastTroop> thats cool
[0:15:35] <Nyckelus> @fruit_pie_the_magician I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs 3. One here, in the pit, and in another boss arena.
[0:15:39] <NHTreace> so many good releases in the next few months
[0:15:41] <HelghastTroop> glad its not only on consoles
[0:15:42] <%sporeian94> Woolie just go ham on him
[0:15:43] <NHTreace> biomutant
[0:15:58] <+bunchaghosts> and dogs also
[0:16:01] <%RyTYoung> Go full balls blazing
[0:16:02] <Kghaleon> rekt
[0:16:04] <@Menitta> man theres a lot going on with this boss
[0:16:06] <%Josef_Stryker> I know Ichimonji is a good skill, but wouldn't it be easier to just wail on him?
[0:16:07] <convo445> running away is pretty passive for Sekiro
[0:16:12] <%sporeian94> Woolie if you go in and just spam he gets stunn locked
[0:16:13] <+Zaedum> deflect that terror beam with your sword
[0:16:21] <quamdunk> When he charges for the beam run behind him
[0:16:26] <%Lion_kun> Woolie drinking the purple gourd removes terror
[0:16:28] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> u can parry the laser beam
[0:16:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Probablt the hardest non boss in the game. Harder than a lot of bosses, I'd say
[0:16:29] <+almightychad> become as Leo, no fear
[0:16:29] <%krispen_wa> I accidentally read his name as Skeleton Warrior and got far too hyped
[0:16:49] <+bunchaghosts> yea yea in there
[0:16:51] <+b_aleph> Air deathblow?
[0:17:05] <primaryfire> this is the only enemy where I've managed to use the air deathblow
[0:17:11] <+Killyko> there is a tool that lets you eat his attacks, but that may make it too easy
[0:17:26] <%sporeian94> Woolie pop your confetti and just go ham in and stun lock him
[0:17:34] <Nyckelus> @killyko They already talked about the umbrella if that‚Äôs what you mean.
[0:17:35] <ullyzeez> just hit him dude
[0:17:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[0:17:42] <Aydarkzero> lightning strikes coming in

[0:17:48] <+almightychad> never say die!

[0:19:43] <%krispen_wa> Become Sasuke, use them Shuriken
[0:19:51] <HelghastTroop> if only you can get ishin's six shooter in this
[0:19:52] <+BurncoatRapscallion> The underwater one is a paaaaain
[0:20:06] <samazam94> shuriken and flame pretty good combo
[0:20:16] <%sporeian94> He's in the double monke cave
[0:20:19] <ullyzeez> he in a cave with the big drop
[0:20:20] <convo445> think he'll do boss rushes? Doesn't waste resources and it's just bosses, but we'd be here all year
[0:20:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Puppers: sniped
[0:20:33] <%sporeian94> you get a run required for a upgrade to some prosthetic
[0:20:38] <HelghastTroop> donest that one dude in the jar sell you a lazuli?
[0:20:49] <%sporeian94> Yeah he sells 2 for like 7 scales a peice

[0:21:10] <samazam94> if only bloodborne guns were as strong as the shurikens here
[0:21:12] <primaryfire> water headless are a lot easier for sure
[0:21:13] <%sporeian94> go for the fake one first
[0:21:20] <Kghaleon> I think the headless just give you those infinite candy
[0:21:35] <HelghastTroop> @samazam94 just use the repater pistol with max bloodtinge Kappa
[0:21:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Other Shichimen Warrior isn't worth the time tbh

[0:22:03] <+bunchaghosts> oh yeah haha zero heals lets go
[0:22:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> refresh yo gourd
[0:22:11] <%sporeian94> Reminder jar man is Miyazaki's favorite character
[0:22:13] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Is this the first From game that has swimming?
[0:22:25] <HelghastTroop> its actually easier to fight these dudes underwater than on land
[0:22:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> whoa there swimming in this game?! woolieSHOOK
[0:22:38] <huskarl_zap> SUPERDUPER SUMOS
[0:22:42] <+almightychad> water footsies
[0:22:43] <+Mendin> Underwater Repuuken
[0:22:54] <%KiwamiKiryu> man, this looks bad
[0:23:01] <HelghastTroop> @sporeian94 is that real
[0:23:09] <HelghastTroop> cant even see their feet Kappa
[0:23:19] <HelghastTroop> espected maiden in black
[0:23:27] <%sporeian94> Yeah he mentioned in some interview that's his favorite character
[0:23:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's not good
[0:23:29] <%sirisvirus> its not even worth it
[0:23:29] <huskarl_zap> did he kill the bull here?
[0:23:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie will probably never use the item it gives
[0:23:51] <HelghastTroop> @sporeian94 i do like how they a real big weirdos who just want to be fish
[0:23:59] <+IronChefWookie> which yakuza side quest is this?
[0:23:59] <samuelfisk> He did kill the bull
[0:24:04] <Nyckelus> Yeah, it‚Äôs essentially that one Bloodborne mechanic in item form.
[0:24:06] <huskarl_zap> yee
[0:24:08] <convo445> you got more movement options under water but i don't think there's much to gain unless you want every advantage for the final bosses
[0:24:08] <ullyzeez> you get an indian man?
[0:24:13] <+Mendin> Minh no
[0:24:21] <primaryfire> it's up on the dpad in bloodbornem you get spirit emblems for health
[0:24:22] <shorololo> it gives you talismans for health
[0:24:22] <AShinyVagikarp> spirit emblems right?
[0:24:23] <%0rond> it's bloodborne blood bullets
[0:24:24] <+almightychad> Tanto cuts you for emblem
[0:24:25] <+Mendin> It turns HP into spirit emblems
[0:24:26] <crimsonsaens> It's not bite down, it gives you spirit emblems
[0:24:27] <dizimous> No, it gives you Emblems for health
[0:24:30] <Deasmeister> No it's for emblems
[0:24:42] <ullyzeez> fake news
[0:24:47] <quamdunk> It gives spirit emblems for HP dammit
[0:24:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no minh its blood bullets
[0:24:52] <+Mendin> Minh has stolen the One Guy power from us
[0:24:53] <Nyckelus> The item you‚Äôre talking about Minh is from somewhere else.
[0:24:54] <HelghastTroop> minh with the brain worms notsquishY
[0:25:06] <the_extra_> You can also get the Umbrella without Lapis Lazuli
[0:25:11] <FrostedZaibatsu> No, he was explaining the bite down mechanic
[0:25:11] <@Menitta> I should give this game another shot
[0:25:25] <crimsonsaens> I believe the Bottomless Hole was closer
[0:25:36] <HelghastTroop> @Menitta this game is good, it just takes alot of you to master it
[0:25:37] <%sporeian94> it's monke cave
[0:25:42] <dizimous> It's right next to the Bottomless hole idol
[0:25:43] <+RD_nx> the environments alone make me wanna go back, I never beat the final boss either
[0:25:45] <%sporeian94> go back i need to be monke
[0:26:02] <HelghastTroop> reject the dragons heir become monke
[0:26:07] <convo445> or you can watch cool guys play the game instead, also traversel is always cool as heck
[0:26:09] <@Menitta> Yeah its real tough to master. I just never found it satisfying to progress in general
[0:26:41] <HelghastTroop> the one crtique i have of this gaem is im not real into the side quests from npcs
[0:26:49] <HelghastTroop> wernet very memroable
[0:26:51] <primaryfire> you can get an air to air deathblow when he jumps up
[0:26:58] <Equirah> Sekiro is a game where if you don't have the curiosity to see where it leads it becomes really unsatisfying really fast
[0:26:59] <+BurncoatRapscallion> That was cool
[0:27:04] <convo445> i mean i never mastered the arcade games in Yakuza, some things require more effort than you're willing to invest on your own time
[0:27:45] <Realzameer> betusCas
[0:27:45] <@Menitta> I never got the feeling like in Nioh or other Fromsoft games of "YES I finally beat that boss"
[0:27:45] <+patel347> the purple umbrella is really useful for this guy
[0:28:10] <+MacDatAss> you can parry the laser but its really risky if you miss
[0:28:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:28:11] <+Mendin> I was out of confetti once and I think I took a pip off one of these or the headless solely with the purple parries, it was silly
[0:28:15] <%RyTYoung> @menitta I got that feeling big time from this game and DS 3
[0:28:16] <HelghastTroop> another gripe is how they repeat alot of the same mid bosses alot in this
[0:28:27] <@Solidus_113> crazy how this was game of the year
[0:28:29] <$arcielardor> this looks like bullshit
[0:28:33] <convo445> Pat had a good enough time, just tell yourself you were worse than him and maybe spite will give you wings
[0:28:36] <@Menitta> I felt it the strongest with Nioh 2
[0:28:42] <Coystick> Bonk
[0:28:48] <+almightychad> ohhhh
[0:28:53] <+almightychad> yeeeee
[0:28:55] <@Menitta> LUL Spite gives you wings
[0:28:58] <+b_aleph> gg
[0:29:02] <%DegenCat> ONE SHOT
[0:29:05] <%RyTYoung> @menitta started Nioh 2 a couple nights ago, and I have definitely felt that already with the snake boss NotLikeThis
[0:29:08] <Nyckelus> First try!
[0:29:19] <+MacDatAss> ceremonial tanto POGGERS
[0:29:20] <%itzzaPIZZA> woolieFUN woolieFUN
[0:29:37] <convo445> sacrfice your health for some spirit emblems
[0:29:39] <%RyTYoung> doodGood
[0:29:43] <%sporeian94> There's also one in monke cave
[0:29:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Blood bullets like bloodborne
[0:29:48] <@Menitta> @RyTYoung yeah that boss was roooough for me at first. I beat it initially by cheesing it with throwing hatchets lol
[0:29:48] <HelghastTroop> devoted souls sounds like it would be a spell in a dark souls game
[0:30:04] <crimsonsaens> Probably the most useful item behind the gourd.
[0:30:11] <%RyTYoung> @menitta I should've done that, I'm using dual hatchets NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:30:19] <@Menitta> oh no LUL
[0:30:37] <$arcielardor> in nioh 2, you eventually reach a point where your stats make up for any ineptitude on your part
[0:30:44] <+MacDatAss> you only have 3 uses on the tanto
[0:30:44] <shorololo> you heal by doing deathblows
[0:30:52] <Nyckelus> Same as in Bloodborne.
[0:30:53] <primaryfire> I think they're temporary like in bloodborne
[0:30:59] <convo445> people get stuck on these games for years sometimes, no need to beat yourself up on things
[0:31:06] <crimsonsaens> They're temporary
[0:31:12] <%sporeian94> There's no point woolie 500 is more than enough
[0:31:15] <Equirah> @arcielardor if you stay at default difficulty yeah, otherwise the game reminds you of your place
[0:31:16] <ullyzeez> i have pat brain so i never used it
[0:31:20] <convo445> what would permament even mean?
[0:31:23] <Futurecity10> @woolieversus it‚Äôs blood bullets
[0:31:24] <DatAsuna> i miss anything big?
[0:31:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> basically, if you run out, you can have more
[0:31:37] <%RyTYoung> @arcielardor I noticed that in Nioh 1 a lot, number go up helps my ineptitude big time
[0:31:48] <convo445> so long as you heal you can get 5 emblems i think
[0:31:51] <$arcielardor> @equirah there's a difficulty selector?
[0:32:16] <convo445> 5 blood emblems for whatever
[0:32:18] <ullyzeez> for half your life tho???
[0:32:24] <Klefth> There kinda is a hard mode with the bell
[0:32:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> actually pretty useful if theres a tool you like using
[0:32:29] <convo445> is it half?
[0:32:38] <%0rond> just don't get hit lmao
[0:32:43] <+Mendin> Since they're underwater, they take normal damage and you don't need confetti
[0:32:43] <+MacDatAss> oh god not the headless
[0:32:44] <ullyzeez> @klefth and kuro's charm too
[0:32:47] <convo445> or deflect every hit
[0:32:51] <+RD_nx> damn, imagine a yoahimitsu style stab tho, turn around and maybe take the enemies life instead by stabbing through yourself to hit them
[0:32:51] <Nyckelus> @klefth That and the new game + mechanic is a pain.
[0:32:53] <crimsonsaens> Health comes easily in this game
[0:33:03] <Equirah> @arcielardor beat the base game and it'll introduce you a new difficulty, dlcs assume you're playing on the 2nd and don't downscale that muchfor base
[0:33:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Isnt there an ability to get health back on deathblows or something?
[0:33:46] <primaryfire> @fruit_pie_the_magician yes and it's very good
[0:33:48] <$arcielardor> I love some of the environmental interaction in Nioh 2. like if you hit the big bells with the hand cannon, it will temporarily turn off dark zones
[0:33:48] <Nyckelus> @fruit_pie_the_magician Yeah. There‚Äôs 2 of them and they stack I believe.
[0:33:49] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:33:54] <+b_aleph> LUL
[0:33:55] <DatAsuna> oh this fight
[0:33:55] <+almightychad> dick has been ripped
[0:33:56] <+askalta> still shocked that the swimming is good in this game
[0:33:57] <ullyzeez> bodied
[0:34:00] <crimsonsaens> LUL
[0:34:02] <Klefth> The headless fucking suck
[0:34:08] <brunoberserk> defend your asshole , woolie
[0:34:19] <+MacDatAss> i think its better to kill the clone first
[0:34:24] <%RyTYoung> oh no
[0:34:26] <GeoffGeofreed> Woolie hole got violated
[0:34:31] <%BinaryFireball> shave your balls so you are more hydrodanmic
[0:34:31] <OldManDeckardCain> I guess fromsoft didn't play that mh game with the underwater fights to learn that they suck balls LUL
[0:34:33] <gunsrlove> I feel like this makes up for all of Woolie's smug in the Demon's playthrough with Reggie LUL
[0:34:43] <convo445> i don't think any bosses will require any more upgrades to beat
[0:34:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> yeah so just use the tanto right before stealth murdering someone. all health back
[0:34:57] <%BinaryFireball> sekiro is a very different beast than DS
[0:35:01] <%sporeian94> woolie kill the fake headless first
[0:35:02] <%RyTYoung> @gunsrlove it does LUL
[0:35:03] <+almightychad> mortis
[0:35:03] <%TopTieramisu> everyone's favorite enemy
[0:35:05] <LunarRemix> This one is a fuck
[0:35:06] <%Bluwizard21> @WoolieVersus The underwater headless are the easier headless, but they are still the worst enemies in the game. They are bloodborne enemies in a game that can't function on bloodborne mechanics. There's also a boss coming that is a dark souls boss that you have to try and fight without dark souls mechanics
[0:35:12] <+BurncoatRapscallion> This guy took me a while. The fake one makes it a shit
[0:35:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[0:35:20] <jamox1> I had no idea this was a fight
[0:35:21] <jamox1> Holy fuck
[0:35:33] <%RyTYoung> think this is the only headless I killed when I played LUL
[0:35:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SNIPED
[0:35:36] <Aydarkzero> gonna snipe you monkaS
[0:35:38] <ExpressNode> Is Woolie playing this on his PS5?
[0:35:45] <Aydarkzero> i believe so yes
[0:36:02] <armchairmaster_> This underwater part freaks me the FUCK OUT
[0:36:04] <%RyTYoung> what a shot LUL
[0:36:09] <Aydarkzero> these ghost enemies are so annoying
[0:36:18] <Lobster_Lord> that dead fish corpse is lore important
[0:36:23] <%TopTieramisu> it's a good thing ninjas don't have to breathe
[0:36:29] <%KiwamiKiryu> I wanted to play this game after beating all other Soul games but I don't think I want to now, this seems rough :/
[0:36:33] <ExpressNode> This feels like the Atlantis part of Kingdom Hearts
[0:36:38] <convo445> i must be seeing double, four headless
[0:36:41] <ullyzeez> why not kill him too??
[0:36:52] <bear_breaker20> looks cool
[0:36:56] <+JingKaisean> man, this dodging
[0:37:03] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It's rough but when you get the combat down it gets great
[0:37:07] <benjiFG> oh this fight
[0:37:10] <%RyTYoung> BEEG FEESH
[0:37:26] <+BurncoatRapscallion> The problem I have with this game is it's easy to just ignore every enemy you see
[0:37:27] <%TopTieramisu> yep
[0:37:27] <+chiazam> Hit and run
[0:37:30] <Aydarkzero> yeah it's not the worst underwater combat
[0:37:35] <+TheyCallMeVawn> Greed
[0:37:42] <%TopTieramisu> "he's almost done" -man talking about himself
[0:37:43] <ullyzeez> @burncoatrapscallion thats every Soulsborne game tho
[0:37:44] <convo445> the two for one combo certainly hits
[0:38:01] <+almightychad> prey slaughtered
[0:38:01] <Aydarkzero> the good buff
[0:38:04] <ExpressNode> I'm surprised you can't drown but the game is already hard enough
[0:38:09] <Nyckelus> Niceu!
[0:38:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It will absolutely stomp you until you get good at it. I feel the initial face stomping process while you still suck is harsher in this
[0:38:11] <+JingKaisean> nice
[0:38:15] <%BinaryFireball> this game makes me want candy
[0:38:17] <convo445> it's magic breathing dude
[0:38:21] <DSD24> Power Within?
[0:38:24] <+JingKaisean> these spiritfalls are really not worth the effort of fighting these guys
[0:38:43] <convo445> at least you won't have to buy them anymore
[0:38:46] <jamox1> Is that all you get for fighting them? @jingkaisean
[0:38:47] <Nyckelus> @jingkaisean Yeah, it wastes emblems and you can easily buy the candies later.
[0:38:50] <+Grayhammatter> beeg feesh
[0:39:00] <dizimous> Centipede Larvae I believe
[0:39:05] <ullyzeez> it eats health
[0:39:05] <+JingKaisean> i think the candies are better (last longer)
[0:39:08] <Lobster_Lord> PATHS
[0:39:37] <+MacDatAss> only three more headless to go
[0:39:40] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:39:48] <+JingKaisean> are you able to get more confetti or is it capped like before?
[0:40:16] <%TopTieramisu> man, this game would be so much more replayable if the majority of the loot wasn't candy
[0:40:34] <%TopTieramisu> but it's a great first playthrough
[0:40:35] <+almightychad> @JingKaisean I think if you do the merchant sidequest you can unlock the infinite buying ones
[0:40:40] <The_Grand_J> i thought woolie already played this game on stream?
[0:40:43] <convo445> there isn't loot just item drops
[0:40:49] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Maximum Armor
[0:40:53] <+Mendin> The final paragraph is lore unique per necklace, I think
[0:40:54] <+chiazam> Bottom paragraph is different every time
[0:40:55] <samuelfisk> ‚ÄúMy specialty is hounds‚Äù
[0:41:08] <Nyckelus> @jingkaisean It can be farmed and there is an infinite source in a shop later on.
[0:41:12] <%TopTieramisu> woolie stopped his playthrough a while back. this is the return
[0:41:12] <@Solidus_113> you're back to start of game HP
[0:41:17] <convo445> beads are the few lore descriptions in this game
[0:41:34] <samazam94> the lore in this game sucks anyways unfortunately
[0:41:37] <+almightychad> to the lab!
[0:41:45] <+MacDatAss> this is the speedrun item
[0:41:50] <samuelfisk> Large
[0:42:01] <convo445> it doesn't suck for me, but you have to make stuff up to have enough to be angry about
[0:42:04] <+chiazam> ITS 25%
[0:42:04] <Nyckelus> Damage is buffed quite significantly but I can‚Äôt remember by how much. It does shave off a lot of posture though.
[0:42:09] <LunarRemix> It boosts 25% damage to vitality and 50% to posture @WoolieVersus
[0:42:19] <jamox1> ‚ÄúJust Don‚Äôt get hit‚Äù - Jonathan Fighting Games
[0:42:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:42:23] <convo445> not gonna fall for the Pat meme
[0:42:47] <+BurncoatRapscallion> amongus
[0:42:47] <DSD24> We need to deeper
[0:43:04] <GeoffGeofreed> it seems like he already finished the game off stream but he is streaming it where he last left off. Does anyone know if he beat it off stream?
[0:43:21] <+chiazam> Scrap is good too
[0:43:26] <rosemon5001> ayo whut i missed from the start of the stream
[0:43:29] <%TopTieramisu> i like the water areas. definitely not something you'll see in souls
[0:43:34] <+BurncoatRapscallion> He didn't beat the game, he beat Owl on top of the castle. He stopped streaming this game because he wasn't enjoying it
[0:43:34] <+almightychad> Minh strats
[0:43:44] <DSD24> Minhpedia?
[0:43:45] <samazam94> he has yet to finish the game, so no spoilers
[0:43:52] <%Jiggisnipe> Minh also has Crazy Talk
[0:43:53] <artoflec> mm tuna steak
[0:43:53] <Nyckelus> @geoffgeofreed Woolie hasn‚Äôt finished the game yet. He‚Äôs only farmed a little off screen. Minh has finished this awhile ago.
[0:44:09] <%Invlux> LUL
[0:44:09] <%Javaa01> Just hit the buttons good
[0:44:10] <%Bluwizard21> @WoolieVersus Are yall going to get more of the pink carp?
[0:44:11] <asakura_ayase> Crazy Talk act 2
[0:44:17] <@Menitta> Banging your head against a wall until it breaks is a legitimate strategy.
[0:44:23] <@Menitta> Thats how I beat Nioh 2
[0:44:24] <GeoffGeofreed> Nice, I guess to see his reaction on those cool bosses
[0:44:40] <%TopTieramisu> nioh 2's combat is so good
[0:44:41] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Yeah some of the coolest fights are after Owl
[0:44:44] <Chorkly> Darlington "I'm somewhats of a souls player myself" Madden
[0:44:46] <%RyTYoung> Gotta get into the right headset Kappa
[0:44:54] <jamox1> My entire Dark Souls 3 strategy was ‚Äúget abyss watchers set and sword and kill things in style‚Äù
[0:44:57] <+b_aleph> Only Guilty Gear has true lore!
[0:44:57] <DSD24> Brute Counter that progression in Nioh 2
[0:45:08] <+b_aleph> @jamox1 yes
[0:45:10] <@Menitta> tonfa gang
[0:45:15] <%TopTieramisu> fist gang
[0:45:20] <dizimous> It's all about beating your head against a way hut sometimes through in a shurikan to see if it creates an opportunity
[0:45:20] <@Menitta> fist gang too
[0:45:21] <DSD24> Spear Bois
[0:45:25] <+b_aleph> Tonfa gang for the win
[0:45:33] <GeoffGeofreed> if you want lore just listen to Vaati tell it to you or some other know lore tuber
[0:45:33] <+b_aleph> ONLY TONFA
[0:45:34] <+chiazam> Isn't the idol RIGHT THERE?
[0:45:39] <%RyTYoung> Everyone seems to rock the Tonfas in Nioh 1, is that because it's the closest thing to fists?
[0:45:43] <T_Sasquatch> I remember dropping nioh 1 because of the ki mechanic to clear up demon circles in the first boss
[0:45:54] <%TopTieramisu> i was a kusarigama boi in nioh 1
[0:45:54] <samazam94> tonfas because im a huge suikoden fanboy
[0:46:02] <+Sharmanyx> Best looking area in all souls with painted world in DS1 or ash lake a close second
[0:46:03] <DSD24> @RyTYoung Oh definitely
[0:46:05] <jamox1> Tonfas are my secondary but Switchglaive let me use Scythe
[0:46:05] <+samsarasage> Minh is back? Cool
[0:46:08] <linSP> hey guys did woolie do past owl yet
[0:46:12] <@Menitta> idk what spoilers are what
[0:46:14] <%Zanzibar_Junker> I'm a Dragon Ninja Build in Nioh 2 at Dream if the Wise difficulty
[0:46:18] <%Bluwizard21> @T_Sasquatch Nioh 2 is quite enjoyable. the problem being its still a lootershooter/slasher
[0:46:19] <%TopTieramisu> the ki mechanic is great
[0:46:20] <+b_aleph> @T_Sasquatch Oof, Onryoki took me a good 40 tries. It was my first soulslike boss tho
[0:46:23] <+samsarasage> Hi minh
[0:46:29] <%RyTYoung> @dsd24 they seems very OP I'm not gonna lie
[0:46:35] <%RyTYoung> seemed*
[0:46:36] <Exyoh> Tonfas get ridiculous in Nioh 2 once you get Mystic Dyad. I'm still maining them in Dream of the Nioh
[0:46:40] <%TopTieramisu> and being able to see your opponent's stamina is so nice
[0:46:43] <Nyckelus> @linsp He‚Äôs here so yeah he‚Äôs already beat Owl and Monk.
[0:46:47] <GeoffGeofreed> I want to play Nioh 2 someday but I'm afraid on how my computer can handle it, seems not very optimize
[0:47:00] <T_Sasquatch> @b_aleph üëÄ well damn....
[0:47:04] <%TopTieramisu> you can play it on lower settings
[0:47:04] <DSD24> Switchglaive has some good stuff too
[0:47:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dual sword mark of the cross spam is super fucked
[0:47:11] <%RyTYoung> @toptieramisu great addition 100%!
[0:47:11] <+BurncoatRapscallion> The guardian to this area I think is one of my favorite fights
[0:47:16] <@Menitta> Switchglaive is sick
[0:47:17] <jamox1> @exyoh what does mystic dyad do?
[0:47:19] <+JingKaisean> did he kill the shichinin warrior yet?
[0:47:30] <Nyckelus> @burncoatrapscallion Same here. The boss is so cool!
[0:47:31] <samazam94> yeah the pc release is rough
[0:47:33] <linSP> @nyckelus oh I mean if he did the optional owl fight that takes place in memory
[0:47:38] <Exyoh> @jamox1 Pops both mystic skills for that weapon at once
[0:47:40] <GeoffGeofreed> yeah he killed the curse bastards
[0:47:46] <jamox1> Oh that‚Äôs sick as fuck
[0:47:54] <%TopTieramisu> damn one shot
[0:48:02] <Nyckelus> @linsp Ah, in which case no. They said they would come back to that later.
[0:48:03] <T_Sasquatch> @bluwizard21 i can see nioh 1 and 2 games but team ninja make games that feel like they want to punch the player. I can't justify getting Nioh 2 at full price to piss myself off
[0:48:06] <+b_aleph> There'll never be a sicker weapon than sarutobi gunsticks
[0:48:10] <DSD24> Kill em harder
[0:48:29] <samazam94> gunsticks amen
[0:48:30] <jamox1> Gun sticks?!
[0:48:37] <@Menitta> my problem with the gunsticks is that I prefer the skill that doesnt use that perk
[0:48:40] <jamox1> Are those from the dlc?
[0:48:45] <thetrashman_sc> sekiro was sick
[0:48:46] <%TopTieramisu> i feel like nioh 2 added mechanics that make it less frustrating than 1
[0:48:47] <samazam94> his tonfasbare special
[0:48:57] <+b_aleph> @T_Sasquatch just use the slowdowns on bosses
[0:49:06] <jamox1> @toptieramisu the Yokai stuff is so good
[0:49:09] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu The counters are a realyl good addition
[0:49:10] <%TopTieramisu> yep
[0:49:12] <T_Sasquatch> Moshi moshi ?
[0:49:12] <jamox1> I love my summons
[0:49:13] <%Josef_Stryker> Nioh 1 is pretty much "melt or be melted"
[0:49:16] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Nioh 2 added MVC2 assists
[0:49:19] <%Josef_Stryker> Nioh 2 is way more fair by comparison
[0:49:22] <Exyoh> My #1 tip for getting into Nioh 2 is to ram against Gozuki till you get it
[0:49:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:49:24] <GeoffGeofreed> The character creator of Nioh 2 seems to soul caliber levels of fun
[0:49:30] <Aydarkzero> SourPls
[0:49:32] <brunoberserk> wha happun ?
[0:49:36] <%Josef_Stryker> Phone call
[0:49:36] <Equirah> @T_Sasquatch you can get it half price on pc
[0:49:37] <jamox1> Phone call
[0:49:38] <DSD24> Phone Call
[0:49:39] <+bunchaghosts> Artesian better have his money!

[0:49:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> aw yeah silvergun ost
[0:49:45] <%RyTYoung> @zanzibar_junker they did do that huh
[0:49:48] <Realzameer> betusCas
[0:49:48] <Kghaleon> Woolie's mom calling. She knows he's been messin' with ghosts.
[0:49:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @T_Sasquatch the difference is if you're built well things in nioh literally melt
[0:49:51] <+nabs2099> Is everything alright?
[0:49:51] <%TopTieramisu> nioh 2's character creator craps all over souls character creator
[0:49:54] <+b_aleph> The beta for Nioh 2 was fucking brutal tho. Practically no ki regen on dark realms
[0:50:07] <jamox1> Nioh 2 character creator is so good
[0:50:11] <%Josef_Stryker> The thing with Dark Realms is that u gain anima faster tho
[0:50:20] <%Josef_Stryker> So ur encouraged to go nuts with your Yokai Abilities
[0:50:21] <jamox1> Makes me actually try and transmog so I can see my face
[0:50:22] <andre11dr> Maybe it's because "THE DEVIL GAME, DARLINGTON"
[0:50:23] <DSD24> Plus stuff like Divine Water helps out
[0:50:24] <Exyoh> It was only when I saw a couple friends play that I really got in with Nioh 2. It became my fave game of 2020
[0:50:45] <@Menitta> Nioh 2 wouldve been my goty last year if it weren;t for Yakuza 7
[0:50:54] <%Josef_Stryker> There's only like two bosses in Nioh 2 I consider poorly designed bosses
[0:51:02] <andre11dr> Also Hades was pretty sick
[0:51:03] <artoflec> if i buy the dlc on ps4 version of nioh 2 will i have it downloadable on PS5 artofl1Hm
[0:51:04] <%Bluwizard21> whahappun?
[0:51:07] <%Josef_Stryker> Compare this to Nioh 1 where there were alot of stinkers
[0:51:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I feel like no one knows you can just pop amrita things to get your super with no delay
[0:51:14] <@Menitta> @artoflec yes
[0:51:19] <artoflec> nice
[0:51:20] <T_Sasquatch> @equirah only have a ps4 :(
[0:51:22] <Exyoh> Everything you have on the PS4 version makes the jump to PS5
[0:51:28] <DSD24> Plus the DLC bosses for Nioh 2 were good
[0:51:32] <+b_aleph> @artoflec yeah, you need all of them tho. And the same does not apply to Nioh 1
[0:51:42] <samazam94> it moved! ghosts!

[0:51:43] <%TopTieramisu> nioh 1's biggest flaw was its lack of variety. thankfully nioh 2 just built on top of what was in 1 so you get a much more full experience
[0:51:43] <%Josef_Stryker> The Nioh 2 DLC bosses were fucking sick
[0:51:45] <artoflec> yeh i ended up getting nioh 1 on pc with all the dlc anyway
[0:51:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> I keep forgetting radiant silver gun was Hitoshi Sakimoto. another reason why woollie liked the 13 sentinels ost woolieSPICE
[0:51:46] <@Menitta> I only finished the first DLC of Nioh 2
[0:51:53] <jamox1> I feel like I had more enemies I hated than bosses
[0:51:53] <Kghaleon> Suck it youtubers
[0:52:01] <jamox1> Fuck those Ippon Darata
[0:52:04] <DSD24> Yoshitsune was a rad boss
[0:52:09] <Exyoh> The second DLC in particular is wild, but all 3 add a ton
[0:52:11] <%Josef_Stryker> You'll really enjoy the DLC2 bosses
[0:52:12] <andre11dr> I didn't get to far in Nioh 2 because by the time i finished Nioh 1 and all it's fucking DLC i was burned out on it
[0:52:31] <+nabs2099> How to make Nioh 2 ez?
[0:52:32] <Exyoh> The final set of tonfas you can get in DLC 3 are fully worth it
[0:52:32] <%Josef_Stryker> Playing them back to back will do that
[0:52:39] <%TopTieramisu> i would like to play a less mission based iteration of nioh
[0:52:40] <crimsonsaens> I just played Nioh 2 dlc2, I couldn't stand the lightning boss
[0:52:43] <T_Sasquatch> Shout out to the surge 2 tho. It deserves more attention
[0:52:45] <GeoffGeofreed> I love that Nioh really did become it's own thing that makes it different enough to warrant its existence.
[0:52:50] <%TopTieramisu> that combat with an interconnected world? heaven
[0:52:57] <DSD24> @crimsonsaens Oh yeah that boss was rough
[0:53:01] <%Josef_Stryker> @crimsonsaens Lightning Stop Talismans help a ton
[0:53:14] <Kghaleon> Minh didn't tell him about the secret cave nearby?
[0:53:23] <@Menitta> I'd like to try to go back to Nioh 1 at some point
[0:53:26] <%Bluwizard21> @Josef_Stryker Sloth talismans are god
[0:53:27] <andre11dr> Im pretty burnt out on Ancient Japan in general,with Nioh, Sekiro, and Ghost coming out so closely
[0:53:32] <@Menitta> But I love all of 2's changes
[0:53:34] <samazam94> dall famage
[0:53:36] <ullyzeez> i got lost at this part for a while
[0:53:37] <usurper_sos> Secret Tunnel!
[0:53:37] <Exyoh> I skipped Nioh 1 entirely, & I'm tempted
[0:53:39] <jamox1> I feel like I‚Äôd just be upset playing 1 after 2
[0:53:47] <DSD24> Co Op in Nioh 2 is way better
[0:53:49] <@Menitta> yeah thats my worry
[0:53:49] <T_Sasquatch> Nioh combat is definitely the most in-depth and varied souls like combat
[0:53:52] <jamox1> Especially cause the Yokai system is so good
[0:53:53] <%Josef_Stryker> I don't think I can go back to Nioh 1 because of how much QOL is in Nioh 2
[0:53:56] <Kghaleon> There's the secret tunnel for the guy in the jar.
[0:54:01] <%Josef_Stryker> Plus I'll greatly miss my Yokai powers
[0:54:02] <DSD24> In 1 if both of you die the mission gets restarted
[0:54:03] <samazam94> nioh 1 is not bad
[0:54:10] <deviljhojho_> looks like some sort of stupid fish
[0:54:10] <jamox1> Yeah
[0:54:14] <%Josef_Stryker> Nioh 1 is still hella great
[0:54:16] <%TopTieramisu> well, it's more like a character action game in terms of combat
[0:54:19] <jamox1> Co op is so much nicer in 2
[0:54:22] <+bunchaghosts> precious...bait? like a yummy worm
[0:54:23] <VidulaSaix> He said underwater and Woolie still tries to go on land LUL
[0:54:23] <%Josef_Stryker> But Nioh 2 did so much to improve it
[0:54:30] <%TopTieramisu> souls really does feel barren combat-wise compared to nioh
[0:54:51] <VidulaSaix> Well Souls has never really tried to be character actiony
[0:54:56] <@Menitta> If there was a game with Fromsoft level design and Nioh combat, it would be one of the best games ever made
[0:54:58] <jamox1> True but souls does have a lot more weapons
[0:55:01] <+b_aleph> I remember playing bloodborne and thinking it was slow as fuck thanks to Nioh
[0:55:07] <andre11dr> Damn water got nice in games, i remember when it used to look like shit
[0:55:10] <%TopTieramisu> nioh has parries, tons of combo strings, enemy weakpoints, etc etc
[0:55:10] <jamox1> Nioh 2 has like 12 really good ones
[0:55:14] <GeoffGeofreed> Nioh 2 is the better souls game than Sekiro, but Sekiro is more of Tenchu game than souls
[0:55:15] <Equirah> @T_Sasquatch by.... not being having souls-like combat at all?
[0:55:18] <andre11dr> Still can't do hair tho
[0:55:22] <%Bluwizard21> @samazam94 nioh 1 problems were the convuluted upgrade system and the insane lootershooter shit
[0:55:27] <%Afterman_> Afterman_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Probably already known, but the actress for ash kecthum was okino in 13 sentinels
[0:55:35] <samazam94> now if only elden rings have sekiro combat but with more than justbone weapon
[0:55:40] <%Bluwizard21> @samazam94 nioh 2 isnt much different they just explain it better
[0:55:45] <Exyoh> I'm running a build with Ultimate Stamina for AA-tier agility, & it sure feels like character action
[0:55:49] <@Menitta> 4kids Ash Ketchum or current Ash Ketchum
[0:55:53] <jamox1> I‚Äôm honestly sorta worried about elden ring
[0:55:56] <%ZweihanderSteve> 4kids
[0:56:00] <GeoffGeofreed> I just want more Elden Ring news tbh
[0:56:01] <@Menitta> Sick
[0:56:02] <jamox1> The term open world scares me nowadays
[0:56:18] <Kghaleon> GG
[0:56:23] <artoflec> i only played 13 sentinels in japanese
[0:56:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:26] <+nabs2099> I've actually given up on ER news tbh
[0:56:40] <andre11dr> I think it's gonna be Witcher with Souls combat
[0:56:47] <+JingKaisean> elden ring has gotten away from me and i don't know anything about it
[0:56:54] <@Menitta> could you imagine thinking Elden Ring exists Kappa
[0:57:00] <jamox1> What if elden ring is a strand type game
[0:57:02] <andre11dr> Or maybe more something like Dragons Dogma
[0:57:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what's an elden ring
[0:57:11] <DSD24> Dev's gotta stop announcing games with nothing
[0:57:15] <%Afterman_> @Menitta that was my response to when I found out lmao
[0:57:17] <samazam94> ooooohhhhhh
[0:57:21] <Equirah> thatthing's not coming out for 4-6 years
[0:57:27] <mortalmanbaby> @JingKaisean theres not really anything to now at this point
[0:57:34] <+nabs2099> @andre11dr So it'll be a good game
[0:57:38] <jamox1> @dsd24 6-months to a year before release
[0:57:41] <%Solarint> mannn underwater scares the SHIT out of me
[0:57:45] <+b_aleph> Elden Ring will still come out before Winds of Winter
[0:57:45] <%ZweihanderSteve> LMAO
[0:57:47] <jamox1> That should be the announcement time frame
[0:57:50] <+nabs2099> How dare you Woolie
[0:57:50] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:57:53] <+JingKaisean> does anyone actually care about the real story ending for game of thrones anymore? apparently books are being worked on, but I don't hear anything about the plot
[0:57:54] <@Menitta> beach
[0:57:55] <%TopTieramisu> i hope elden ring really brings some new mechanics to the table because the roll-and-attack combat is so played out
[0:57:56] <%RyTYoung> Pool
[0:57:56] <%Afterman_> @Solarint yep. ill take a pool over beach any day.
[0:57:58] <ullyzeez> who doesnt like swimming??
[0:57:59] <VidulaSaix> Beaches suck
[0:58:00] <DSD24> @jamox1 That's the best timeframe
[0:58:02] <%Solarint> subnautica is one of the only games to legitimately terrify me
[0:58:04] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck beaches
[0:58:05] <OldManDeckardCain> HA
[0:58:08] <wqorst> sand DansGame
[0:58:08] <%ZweihanderSteve> Woolie, known holder of STRONG opinions about swimming
[0:58:08] <@Menitta> Pools are the worst
[0:58:10] <%Afterman_> too much underwater at the beaches
[0:58:11] <DSD24> I like pools
[0:58:11] <lbrownthedestroyer> salt water pool exist
[0:58:11] <+nabs2099> Swimming is my favourite sport I can't believe you've done this
[0:58:11] <+klooswep> "swimming is swimming" from the makers of "destiny is destiny" Kappa
[0:58:12] <%Solarint> oceans are fucking scary
[0:58:14] <%RyTYoung> I'd rather swim in a pool, chill at the beach
[0:58:16] <mortalmanbaby> wave pools hella fun thop
[0:58:17] <Kghaleon> Hot tubs are better
[0:58:20] <ullyzeez> yea cuz saltwater is way better
[0:58:21] <balthazar758> woolie loves the salt
[0:58:22] <%RyTYoung> @mortalmanbaby agreed
[0:58:23] <usurper_sos> LUL
[0:58:26] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie gre up with bitches huh
[0:58:26] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:58:28] <+b_aleph> He grew up with bitches LUL
[0:58:30] <Sapphire_Breeze> fuck -garbage- beaches
[0:58:30] <%SainEdge> LUL
[0:58:31] <%Afterman_> BEACHES are NICE. The sea is not.
[0:58:32] <VidulaSaix> I am indeed talking about North American garbage beaches
[0:58:33] <+JingKaisean> east coast beaches trash
[0:58:34] <T_Sasquatch> LUL

[0:58:47] <+thecosmicfly> Nah fuck all beaches. Hate sand, see Anakin quote for why
[0:58:47] <+ja07sj> seriously please go to a jamaican beach
[0:58:47] <Indigo_Automaton> The ocean is full of fish piss
[0:58:48] <primaryfire> how alive is the water on the beaches you're familiar with?
[0:58:48] <%Invlux> "fuck beaches" >only been to Myrtle Beach
[0:58:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but nice in their own way
[0:58:50] <%RyTYoung> Scotland beaches are a hit and miss
[0:58:51] <DSD24> I don't like overcrowded beaches
[0:58:52] <%Solarint> The ocean is scary as fuck though
[0:58:52] <Spoofy16> beaches are too salty and sandy
[0:58:53] <brunoberserk> DAMN
[0:58:54] <mortalmanbaby> Hawaii beaches must be nice
[0:58:55] <%KiwamiKiryu> Beaches in Mexico are cool
[0:58:56] <redrins> I live in portugal, we have great beaches, I still hate them
[0:58:56] <@Menitta> Even then, they're still better than pools
[0:58:57] <samazam94> i just want more games to have weapons clashes and clangs like this game
[0:58:57] <andre11dr> Beaches are pretty nice around here
[0:58:59] <+JingKaisean> they're all on the west coast
[0:59:01] <twoah> Caribbean beaches are top tier

[0:59:08] <+JingKaisean> maybe florida... but fuck florida
[0:59:09] <+nabs2099> Bondi Beach in Sydney was pretty good admittedly. went there back when I lived in Oz.
[0:59:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> everything north of LA on the west coast is cold af
[0:59:10] <Kghaleon> Living in LA, swimming in the ocean is a bad idea.
[0:59:17] <420mangojuice> y'all dont know whats good
[0:59:17] <%ZweihanderSteve> PEI is fun cuz there's a red sand half and a white sand half
[0:59:22] <andre11dr> I like Turkey and Greece beaches, those are pretty nice
[0:59:23] <%Afterman_> @Kghaleon came out with 2 more hands?
[0:59:24] <DatAsuna> the further from the equater, the worse the beaches get
[0:59:26] <%Javaa01> Now the question is, freshwater beach or seaside beach
[0:59:30] <%RyTYoung> A beach next to the Red Sea, THATS what you WANT
[0:59:36] <Kghaleon> @Afterman_ and probably some diseases
[0:59:36] <T_Sasquatch> I've been to a bunch of beaches in African countries ..... Yea.... Not great
[0:59:39] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Tropical beaches are the best, you'd need to put effort on finding bad ones
[0:59:40] <+bunchaghosts> Sandcastle Superbeach

[1:00:13] <T_Sasquatch> I've never seen blue water at a beach LUL
[1:00:14] <+bunchaghosts> so course and rough....

[1:02:08] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Magicarp is immortal
[1:02:08] <+JingKaisean> and its body is in the headless ape dungeon or something?
[1:02:10] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Gotta love Fromsoft making fish with mouths that resemble skulls.

[1:02:21] <%SainEdge> true LUL
[1:02:21] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:02:22] <samazam94> if only carps tastes good
[1:02:24] <%Afterman_> woolie water hits like concrete after a certain height
[1:02:24] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[1:02:24] <+nabs2099> WATER FALL DAMAGE IS REAL THO
[1:02:30] <OkamiDude15> ITS SUPER REAL
[1:02:30] <+bunchaghosts> worst
[1:02:31] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> everything will kill you!
[1:02:32] <DSD24> Sekiro Water Damages Twice
[1:02:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie water hurts if you fall from high
[1:02:33] <+PharosOfLight> The surface tension of water is no joke
[1:02:35] <Equirah> water hurts
[1:02:38] <crimsonsaens> It does hurt to fall into water
[1:02:39] <Indigo_Automaton> Fall from high enough and water might as well be concrete
[1:02:41] <%Jiggisnipe> it's real but this is a video game so fuck that
[1:02:42] <KaiserMario> Ever did a belly flop?
[1:02:42] <+askalta> yeah jump off the bridge it water sucks
[1:02:43] <Kghaleon> I forgot about that foreshadowing with the one at the bottom of the lake
[1:02:45] <+klooswep> water fall damage makes sense for normal people, but you're a ninja tho
[1:02:46] <andre11dr> Don't go Jason Waterfalls
[1:02:47] <+nabs2099> NO SHUT UP THO
[1:02:57] <%Solarint> i miss that hl2 no fall damage as long as you land in some kind of water, even a puddle
[1:02:57] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Metal gear time!
[1:02:57] <%Afterman_> he forget to level his dex high enough to negate fall dmg
[1:03:00] <dizimous> I see no reason to care either way
[1:03:11] <jamox1> metal gear fish
[1:03:13] <%SainEdge> monkaS

[1:03:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> carped
[1:03:29] <%Josef_Stryker> What was your plan Woolie?

[1:03:46] <%Afterman_> carpe diem'd
[1:03:47] <%Solarint> man fuck fishes
[1:03:48] <%Josef_Stryker> WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?
[1:03:53] <@Menitta> Woolie is really...fishing for a solution
[1:03:53] <+b_aleph> REEL BIG FISH
[1:03:55] <%Solarint> fishes can eat a dick
[1:03:57] <samazam94> minh with the vore fetish
[1:03:57] <Mr_Zero5232> Grounded flashbacks hitting me hard
[1:03:58] <andre11dr> Some enemies in Souls do actually eat you
[1:03:59] <balthazar758> chomped
[1:04:00] <420mangojuice> hint hint wink wink*
[1:04:03] <asakura_ayase> Carpe denied
[1:04:03] <velgaduere> @Josef_Stryker to go up to the surface that was clearly right there? lmao
[1:04:05] <+bunchaghosts> surface was plan A and B
[1:04:07] <jamox1> Woolie hanging out in the ‚Äúcannot see‚Äù zone
[1:04:08] <DSD24> Wood blocked
[1:04:09] <%Afterman_> vishuallll details
[1:04:16] <+JingKaisean> oh he never killed the boss of this area
[1:04:17] <crimsonsaens> The fish monsters in BB dlc eat you
[1:04:22] <MoistHeinous> cutting things underwater is pretty difficult
[1:04:24] <KaiserMario> Man, Woolie salty...
[1:04:37] <Kghaleon> Woolie and his brute forcing every situation
[1:04:39] <OkamiDude15> listen, sekiro man has bad form when diving into the water
[1:04:40] <VidulaSaix> I love how Woolie is completely ignoring the path and trying to brute force it LUL
[1:04:47] <%Solarint> ds2
[1:04:51] <+b_aleph> gg
[1:05:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you did it you beat the carp
[1:05:03] <T_Sasquatch> Ds2 LUL
[1:05:05] <ullyzeez> damn spreedrun strats
[1:05:06] <%Afterman_> woolie dont miss. except at fps
[1:05:09] <%Josef_Stryker> I love DS2 but that shit was stupid
[1:05:11] <+klooswep> you could climb over this rock pile, or you could absorb the souls of four powerful bosses.
[1:05:13] <andre11dr> "DS 2 had great level design" said nobody
[1:05:18] <DSD24> Kill those 4 gods to go over that rubble
[1:05:18] <VidulaSaix> I'll take poorly textured Jebaited over invisible walls
[1:05:21] <samazam94> do it smart at least
[1:05:25] <+bunchaghosts> had to have a reason for the light?
[1:05:30] <+Mendin> The undead curse of hollows is their Dark Soul Being Weighed Down By [Gravity]
[1:05:33] <Nyckelus> They really should have just made a giant impassable wall.
[1:05:44] <T_Sasquatch> If souls characters could mantle they'd be Gods
[1:05:55] <DSD24> Invincible Walls that block your shots when trying to aim at a enemy is the worst
[1:06:00] <%Bluwizard21> Nioh 2 has that problem. Your character can jump 7 feet straight up and destroy rock monsters, but a 4 foot high plywood gate bars passage
[1:06:02] <%ChoculaUltra> quick! put a pile of unbreakable boxes!
[1:06:02] <%Afterman_> @T_Sasquatch demon souls character too strong. he could climb up.
[1:06:04] <balthazar758> unjumpable fence
[1:06:08] <@Menitta> Could you imagine if you could jump in Bloodborne
[1:06:10] <velgaduere> a fuckin Family Guy game had more clever boundaries than most 3D games of its time ffs
[1:06:14] <@Menitta> climb the fence
[1:06:22] <andre11dr> Well you kinda can
[1:06:24] <jamox1> Bloodborne man jump terrifies me
[1:06:29] <andre11dr> But it's trash
[1:06:35] <+bunchaghosts> Slugmen
[1:06:38] <@Menitta> you can "jump" true
[1:06:42] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> unfallable cliffs in early action games
[1:06:45] <Kghaleon> Go talk to the old lady
[1:06:46] <NDenizen> FWEEE

[1:07:03] <+b_aleph> @Menitta Could you imagine if you could face the Orphan of Kos is Super Mario World?
[1:07:05] <%sirisvirus> not these ones
[1:07:06] <thebalticguy1> go talk to that old woman
[1:07:09] <samuelfisk> No you can‚Äôt
[1:07:11] <%Bluwizard21> Search for the woman in there
[1:07:14] <ullyzeez> nope
[1:07:16] <+b_aleph> in*
[1:07:18] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Talk to a ugly minster???
[1:07:18] <velgaduere> ayyyyy
[1:07:21] <samuelfisk> What is Minh smoking?
[1:07:27] <+Grayhammatter> ayyyy, gourd juice
[1:07:37] <420mangojuice> sex juice
[1:07:37] <samazam94> not these one minh
[1:07:38] <+b_aleph> @samuelfisk sesame seeds
[1:07:38] <%sirisvirus> the old woman thanks you for killing them. they are the nobles and they eat people
[1:07:50] <%ChoculaUltra> gone off the gourd goo
[1:07:53] <crimsonsaens> Feed to Emma
[1:07:59] <Kghaleon> The old lady on the lake, I think you can talk to her now
[1:08:01] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I'm glad they brought back level up on bonefire screen
[1:08:03] <ullyzeez> cute girl
[1:08:04] <+bunchaghosts> Fishmen: "Kill...us..." Other Fishmen: "Hey, shut up!"
[1:08:15] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Elden ring better have some Sekiro crazy shinanigans whit multiplayer.
[1:08:26] <DSD24> The cool ending
[1:08:28] <+penjaza> You're running out of time to do the other endings IIRC
[1:08:36] <jamox1> Elden ring better have multiplayer
[1:08:43] <+askalta> it does make ng+ harder if it's the first ending you do
[1:08:54] <+Mitchellsocks> Shura ending is like if you end DS3 at Dancer
[1:08:56] <NDenizen> Is Woolie fighting secret boss man on this run through or is that a different time?
[1:08:56] <%RyTYoung> MY MAN
[1:08:59] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Bad ending is just to get that badass skill
[1:08:59] <samazam94> the waifu
[1:09:05] <primaryfire> I dig the sculptor's talks
[1:09:06] <ullyzeez> get crunk with a cute girl
[1:09:20] <+Mendin> Three different kinds of booze, each one once per person
[1:09:20] <sundizzle> each drink is a different story
[1:09:20] <+patel347> its like one of each booze right?
[1:09:29] <primaryfire> it depends on the type of booze you give them, and you sometimes get multiple of the same kind
[1:09:37] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Good ending is the real continuation of the game.
[1:09:39] <brunoberserk> you misses the last 1/4 of the game in the shura ending
[1:09:53] <andre11dr> I always fight Dancer early, i like having Eldritch the last one
[1:09:55] <DSD24> Ah yes the black one
[1:10:07] <+Mitchellsocks> I've played this game 6 times in the last month and never knew about this eavesdrop
[1:10:08] <ullyzeez> B L A C K
[1:10:11] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[1:10:14] <%Afterman_> uh
[1:10:15] <%SainEdge> Sculpor, Emma and Isshin are possible. But i dont think you can get all dialogue in one playthrough
[1:10:15] <+b_aleph> lul
[1:10:21] <+bunchaghosts> Pacific rim
[1:10:23] <brunoberserk> woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX
[1:10:35] <Nyckelus> Missed a chest on the balcony!
[1:10:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:10:50] <%Bluwizard21> god isshin is such a baddas
[1:10:55] <ullyzeez> is game audio low to you guys?
[1:11:01] <%krispen_wa> Isshin is seriously the coolest
[1:11:12] <samuelfisk> Not me
[1:11:13] <jamox1> Isshin was the coolest guy
[1:11:15] <%krispen_wa> might be in my top 5 Souls characters
[1:11:19] <%RyTYoung> not really
[1:11:22] <%Afterman_> isshin da goat
[1:11:23] <%ChoculaUltra> my smoothbrain ass didn't realize he was the fucking Tengu till NG+ LUL
[1:11:24] <Nyckelus> Definitely grab the chest when you can.
[1:11:27] <%RyTYoung> @krispen_wa same
[1:11:30] <%Afterman_> @ChoculaUltra lmaoooo
[1:11:30] <+nabs2099> grandpa
[1:11:33] <+Dgwyr> urusai just means noisy, yeah
[1:11:37] <NDenizen> Isshin is dangerously based
[1:11:38] <Kghaleon> It would've been cool to see Isshin in his youth, what a badass.
[1:11:39] <ullyzeez> kk thanks might be just me
[1:11:48] <%krispen_wa> @kghaleon if only, right?
[1:11:53] <+Dgwyr> it's just always translated to "shut up" because of the context
[1:11:56] <+nabs2099> @kghaleon or even in his prime...
[1:11:56] <ullyzeez> @kghaleon the intro shows it yeah?
[1:12:00] <%SainEdge> @ChoculaUltra wow. The basically tells you in the first dialogue LUL
[1:12:13] <%Afterman_> half finished eh
[1:12:21] <samazam94> okay guys cool it with the winking
[1:12:21] <%ChoculaUltra> the whole time I must've missed it cuz I was going "you know, these 2 dudes sound awfully familiar"
[1:12:26] <%Afterman_> lmaooo
[1:12:27] <primaryfire> papa is a lightweightr
[1:12:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> baaaaaka
[1:12:34] <%RyTYoung> I'm now getting Sekiro's intro and Ghost of Tsushima opening mixed up...
[1:12:41] <jamox1> Oh man
[1:12:42] <samuelfisk> Lady Butterfly stealing the man‚Äôs booze
[1:12:46] <jamox1> Ghost of Tsushima
[1:12:47] <velgaduere> *wink* our double-speak is so clever *wink wink*
[1:12:52] <%Afterman_> he is too pure he cannot drink!
[1:12:57] <jamox1> That was my 2020 goty
[1:13:02] <%Afterman_> that is the way of war.
[1:13:03] <+askalta> wolf doesn't drink, he's catholic and it's sunday
[1:13:04] <Kghaleon> Maybe it's a small glass of sake
[1:13:06] <Aydarkzero> hesitation monkaS
[1:13:07] <+nabs2099> @velgaduere we are so intelligent and handsome!
[1:13:10] <%krispen_wa> Sekiro drinking would actually force him to have a personality
[1:13:10] <+Conzanagi> Drinking would hinder a Shinboi's abilities
[1:13:17] <sundizzle> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[1:13:18] <ullyzeez> sekiro is a straight edge. only candy for him
[1:13:21] <%SainEdge> never hesitate monkaS
[1:13:21] <primaryfire> got any sake left for emma or the sculptor?
[1:13:29] <Nyckelus> Wait, the chest!
[1:13:32] <%Afterman_> @SainEdge never
[1:13:34] <%RyTYoung> Can a half dead man get shit faced!
[1:13:36] <%RyTYoung> ?*
[1:13:44] <+bunchaghosts> Who was that guy?
[1:13:51] <%krispen_wa> He was That Man
[1:14:00] <samuelfisk> Genichiro‚Äôs grandfather and ultimate badass
[1:14:14] <+bunchaghosts> Old bad badass got it
[1:14:24] <Nyckelus> Only shows up late in the game.
[1:14:24] <+askalta> open gate looks awesome
[1:14:27] <+Mendin> Minh has stolen ]Crazy Talk[
[1:14:32] <%krispen_wa> THE EIGHT GATES?
[1:14:43] <%Javaa01> It IS the Death Gate
[1:14:43] <jamox1> SEKIRO GUY
[1:14:44] <KaiserMario> Mihn is ONE GUY made flesh
[1:14:44] <samazam94> Expect The Unexpexted!
[1:14:45] <+nabs2099> @samuelfisk You mean OUR grandfather
[1:14:49] <%SainEdge> monkaS
[1:14:50] <dizimous> Oh, I didn't realize this was here. That actually fixes a sizeable problem I had with the story
[1:14:53] <+patel347> its lore
[1:14:58] <sundizzle> it's just lore
[1:15:00] <primaryfire> it's just a scroll
[1:15:02] <Kghaleon> You wish you could get it.
[1:15:04] <T_Sasquatch> Rekt
[1:15:05] <ullyzeez> its flavor text
[1:15:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you didn't get the black blade, you got lore on it
[1:15:10] <+penjaza> You gotta do the ending prep soon
[1:15:22] <samazam94> tlavour fext
[1:15:29] <sundizzle> it's not a combat art, just a scroll with lore
[1:15:29] <Nyckelus> @dizimous It‚Äôs because it shows up late in the game. It isn‚Äôt there beforehand.
[1:15:34] <Aydarkzero> whoops all flavor text
[1:15:34] <Kghaleon> Not black enough
[1:15:37] <convo445> What universe is the page Minh is on
[1:15:42] <ullyzeez> @kghaleon LUL
[1:15:57] <+patel347> yeah its lore
[1:16:00] <Nyckelus> Correct answer is lore.
[1:16:13] <samazam94> lol minh dont be too hardbon yourself
[1:16:15] <+Mendin> Once you get the capstone of -any- one tree
[1:16:21] <dizimous> @nyckelus Oooh, that's weird. I wish they presented it earlier, but ya
[1:16:24] <sundizzle> you have to complete one skill tree to unlock the last tree
[1:16:34] <primaryfire> and then talk to the tengu
[1:16:42] <Nyckelus> Definitely try to unlock the last scroll. There‚Äôs cool stuff in it.
[1:17:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[1:17:05] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[1:17:09] <%SainEdge> monkaS
[1:17:11] <sundizzle> monkaS
[1:17:12] <420mangojuice> monkaS
[1:17:13] <+askalta> I never saw this
[1:17:14] <Nyckelus> @dizimous Yeah, it‚Äôs supposed to clue you in on later stuff.
[1:17:16] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[1:17:20] <%RyTYoung> WutFace
[1:17:23] <samazam94> minh strikes again!
[1:17:27] <CoffeeSlice> :c
[1:17:30] <%SainEdge> dad BibleThump
[1:17:32] <sundizzle> she killed ALL of those fish men
[1:17:35] <DatAsuna> fromsoft storytelling strikes again
[1:17:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:17:39] <+chiazam> But why?
[1:17:49] <+patel347> I cant remember if its possile to keep this one alive?
[1:18:01] <%krispen_wa> SUCCC
[1:18:09] <%RyTYoung> Succu
[1:18:09] <+nabs2099> One time I had a pet goldfish and I accidentally overfed it and it died. So anyway about that giant goldfish
[1:18:10] <convo445> i think talking sooner is
[1:18:14] <ullyzeez> SUCC
[1:18:22] <%SainEdge> the fish lady is a different one. This is the one from the roof in the water, the fish lady was in the courtyard
[1:18:25] <Nyckelus> @patel347 I believe opening the door is what kills her so technically you can but the quest will never progress.
[1:18:27] <NDenizen> PLAY BALL
[1:18:34] <%krispen_wa> Fuck, this is a good looking game
[1:18:37] <+Conzanagi> Did Woolie get the fish bait?
[1:18:45] <Kghaleon> Oh I forgot about the next zone, it sucks
[1:18:45] <%krispen_wa> just wish this area wasn't so sickly blue
[1:18:46] <convo445> he got one fish bait
[1:18:49] <ullyzeez> best From area for sure
[1:19:01] <%RyTYoung> I would definitely put Sekiro and Tsushima on the same level for aesthetic, one outshines the other in different ways
[1:19:05] <samazam94> shinto heaven
[1:19:06] <+Conzanagi> @convo445 thanks
[1:19:08] <andre11dr> This is the best looking Souls game probably
[1:19:15] <NDenizen> Sekiro has that verticality down
[1:19:19] <sundizzle> have they fed the giant fish?
[1:19:23] <Indigo_Automaton> This and Ashina Castle are some of From's best work
[1:19:27] <%krispen_wa> Demon Souls remake is probably best in terms of actual graphics, but this has best artstyle
[1:19:35] <+BurncoatRapscallion> We could have gotten something cool like this sooner if Ubisoft weren't cowards and actually made Assassin's Creed: Japan
[1:19:46] <T_Sasquatch> We really had a massive year of games set in Japan
[1:19:52] <Nyckelus> Oh, use the blood sword technique on the white lizards!
[1:19:52] <Indigo_Automaton> PogChamp
[1:19:53] <%RyTYoung> @krispen_wa For sure, Des remake is insanely gorgeous
[1:19:55] <+BurncoatRapscallion> We could have more
[1:19:55] <NDenizen> Yeah and its happening again
[1:19:57] <brunoberserk> LUL LUL LUL
[1:19:57] <andre11dr> It definitely looks better than Bloodborne graphically, that game is hard carried by its art
[1:19:57] <%hax_metatron> Bestowal on the lizard cum is a great offensive boost
[1:19:58] <%SainEdge> PogChamp
[1:19:59] <NDenizen> Japanese MH, Japanese Pokemon
[1:20:01] <Nyckelus> Something cool happens!
[1:20:02] <jamox1> @burncoatrapscallion at this point I really don‚Äôt want that, not after what AC has become
[1:20:24] <%RyTYoung> "WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?" Woolie said to the waterfall LUL
[1:20:32] <Kghaleon> Did he miss the sidequest with the guys in the jars?
[1:20:33] <%krispen_wa> Ghost of Tsushima is AC Japan anyways
[1:20:36] <T_Sasquatch> Ac can die in a fire. After origins just throw away the franchise
[1:20:49] <Indigo_Automaton> YO I just noticed the waterfalls stop flowing when you aren't looking at them
[1:20:54] <+nabs2099> @jamox1 Completely agree. Ubisoft games are ass
[1:20:58] <samazam94> tbh i dont even want ninja AC. feudal/medieval japan has been waaay overused in videogames
[1:21:09] <samazam94> and media in general
[1:21:15] <andre11dr> Man imagine if they did Bloodborne 2 and it was on par with Remake Latria
[1:21:23] <jamox1> The peak of AC for me was when they forgot how to AC and just made a really solid pirate game
[1:21:24] <crimsonsaens> IDK what Minh is referring to
[1:21:33] <+Conzanagi> I think India was an idea being thrown around for AC
[1:21:34] <Fareflight_> Agreed, they should do it in the Fall of the Samurai era. 1854 Japan games.
[1:21:39] <primaryfire> did he unlock the ending that leads to another boss?
[1:21:42] <%krispen_wa> Give me ancient era China game

[1:21:44] <%Lion_kun> The Carp Bell
[1:21:55] <jamox1> @andre11dr for Bloodborne 2 my purchase of a PS5 would be instant
[1:21:55] <%RyTYoung> Ever since listening to the Kojima Frequency all I can think about is a Feudal Metal Gear Solid game, that would be insane
[1:21:56] <NDenizen> tbh I would want something more like the era that Kimetsu no Yaiba is set in
[1:22:03] <%LCLSmoothie> carp me up
[1:22:04] <NDenizen> the clash of new technology and traditional lifestyles
[1:22:07] <%krispen_wa> But not Three Kingdoms China, thats been overdone. some other era of china game
[1:22:07] <%Jiggisnipe> but will people be as excited for it?
[1:22:16] <huskarl_zap> coomer palace
[1:22:35] <deviljhojho_> a new stealth game would be good regardless
[1:22:40] <convo445> wanna do some sick skate tricks on these roofs
[1:22:45] <samazam94> Bakumatsu period is the shit
[1:22:45] <huskarl_zap> Chotomatai.
[1:22:46] <%SainEdge> yeah im also not sure what minh is refering to. But Woolie has do to some cleaning up to do, if he wants to do it before the last part of the game
[1:22:51] <%RyTYoung> @convo445 HERE I AM
[1:22:55] <Nyckelus> There‚Äôs a leap of faith you gotta take.
[1:22:57] <deviljhojho_> nice one
[1:22:58] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't there like a Tenchu reboot going on or was that a fever dream

[1:24:20] <+Mendin> Time to ring the bell
[1:24:27] <andre11dr> After Black Flag they gave up ,then they ungave up with Origins and then gave up again
[1:24:28] <%krispen_wa> Sekiro is the tenchu reboot but you cant play as hot japanese girl so its worse

[1:30:07] <convo445> it doesn't require a phd
[1:30:08] <+Pinkiefan> Seeing Woolie come back to this gives me hope for a return to Outer Wilds.
[1:30:13] <+penjaza> Talk to big guy
[1:30:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> talk to the guy?
[1:30:21] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Just Talk no Jutsu

[1:30:49] <%LCLSmoothie> give the fish a burger, everyone loves burgers
[1:30:58] <andre11dr> It was fine
[1:31:17] <andre11dr> It was definitely better than Fallout 4 that's for sure
[1:31:21] <+nabs2099> @mortalmanbaby Overhyped for sure but it was a really good game. 8/10 ez. why didn't u like it?
[1:31:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This guy rules
[1:31:22] <convo445> feed him that shit
[1:31:23] <mortalmanbaby> @andre11dr not true

[1:31:27] <redrins> thats outer worlds
[1:31:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Ori Voice
[1:31:30] <sundizzle> you can actually overfeed him and not get rewards
[1:31:33] <CoffeeSlice> @krispen_wa that's outer worlds, outer wilds is a masterpiece
[1:31:34] <+Conzanagi> I forget how big he is
[1:31:45] <%krispen_wa> Fallout 4 is a shittier game but I've come back to it far more than Outer Worlds
[1:31:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19

[1:32:03] <DatAsuna> then 2
[1:32:05] <DatAsuna> then 1
[1:32:08] <DatAsuna> then 0
[1:32:08] <%Solarint> thats a lot of fish
[1:32:09] <mortalmanbaby> @nabs2099 lack of anything of interest. fall out 4 was much more intersting with the synths and build paths for compat.
[1:32:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> oh this shit lol
[1:32:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> AND THEY ALL VANISHED
[1:32:15] <@Menitta> oh nooo

[1:32:21] <Ultimatefool> BATTLE ROYALE
[1:32:23] <vVAstrAVv> yurt the goldfish
[1:32:23] <@Solidus_113> Highlander Goldfish
[1:32:26] <+Pinkiefan> Outer Wilds is one of the best games ever made. Outer Worlds is the crappy one.
[1:32:29] <+nabs2099> The goldfish were EATING EACH OTHER??
[1:32:29] <%krispen_wa> STANDING HERE
[1:32:30] <velgaduere> AND THEY SWIM WHEN BIG ONE COMES

[1:32:42] <ullyzeez> LUL
[1:32:45] <Nyckelus> Fish are always in a battle royale.
[1:32:51] <jamox1> Fish knew they could not change society
[1:33:13] <+bunchaghosts> growing larger from the fallen souls
[1:33:14] <huskarl_zap> Beta fish that doesnt kill is a Sigma fish
[1:33:16] <+nabs2099> @mortalmanbaby Won't disagree that Fallout 4 had a much better main story. I also wish we had third person in OW. But it not being as good as FO4 doesn't make it a garbage game tbf
[1:33:16] <@Menitta> oh noooo
[1:33:32] <%RyTYoung> fish are friends not food
[1:33:33] <ghoulspan> fish battle royale
[1:33:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Fish Fortnite
[1:33:40] <%Lion_kun> If Woolie beats the boss, he won't be able to unlock the secret boss.
[1:33:42] <%krispen_wa> The other fish sacrificed themselves in hope that the survivor would be strong enough to break free
[1:33:48] <+bunchaghosts> King of Iron Fish fuck...thats not bad
[1:33:49] <huskarl_zap> Winner of the madden town death game
[1:33:54] <ullyzeez> king of iron fish is godlike
[1:33:55] <+Dorf1> #1 victory royale yeah goldfish were bout to get down
[1:33:57] <andre11dr> parents buy kids fish to teach them that death exists
[1:34:07] <huskarl_zap> That fish did a chug jug
[1:34:07] <samazam94> King of the Iron Fish is pretty good ngl
[1:34:30] <Klefth> Other way?
[1:34:33] <Majiinbooh> i think it was the other side
[1:34:36] <huskarl_zap> coomer house
[1:34:42] <sundizzle> there's something else on the other side of the rooftop
[1:34:42] <Indigo_Automaton> Jump off that edge by the waterfall you were just at
[1:34:48] <%SainEdge> its down there, you can see the grapple point from the roof. Its a bit tricky
[1:34:54] <huskarl_zap> That house was also a death game
[1:35:09] <sundizzle> its on the right side
[1:35:14] <Majiinbooh> keep going left
[1:35:18] <Klefth> Left
[1:35:20] <Indigo_Automaton> Right side not left
[1:35:32] <Nyckelus> Nah, it‚Äôs to the right. It‚Äôs a finicky grapple point.
[1:35:36] <sundizzle> there's a cave in the wall
[1:35:38] <StarlessAH> it's the complete opposite direction
[1:35:39] <sundizzle> on the right
[1:35:42] <samazam94> chat is being real helpful lol
[1:35:48] <%krispen_wa> Its on the Diagonal up bottom
[1:35:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dig up!
[1:35:53] <Klefth> Keep going in that direction
[1:35:59] <Indigo_Automaton> No we're all saying right
[1:36:01] <Kghaleon> This ain't the right way, it's behind the waterfall
[1:36:05] <+Mendin> The Universe Is Confused
[1:36:08] <sundizzle> if we're talking about the pot guy, it's 100% on the right
[1:36:11] <xXVeggiePLusXx> Its onthe downback upper bottom
[1:36:17] <convo445> that's why you use guides with pictures in them
[1:36:25] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It's hidden around the corner of that spot you've been on. that's what he meant about leap of faith
[1:36:26] <andre11dr> go starboard
[1:36:34] <Klefth> It is
[1:36:48] <%krispen_wa> no, go larboard
[1:36:50] <Indigo_Automaton> On the right from that central rooftop
[1:37:02] <%SainEdge> yeah its on the right. You can see the grapplepoint from the roof but i think you can only reach it from the cliff under the roof (not 100 % sure about the last part).
[1:37:18] <sundizzle> that waterfall on the right
[1:37:39] <Indigo_Automaton> Jump off the cliff by the waterfall
[1:37:43] <Kghaleon> Missed it
[1:38:16] <Indigo_Automaton> HERE
[1:38:22] <%SainEdge> past the tree
[1:38:27] <Indigo_Automaton> Off the cliff along the wall
[1:38:29] <+BurncoatRapscallion> You have to go along the wall
[1:38:29] <Klefth> Keep going
[1:38:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> here, stick to the cliff and jump
[1:38:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> keep going
[1:38:34] <%SainEdge> above the tree on the cliff
[1:38:40] <%RyTYoung> Are we trying to progress?
[1:38:43] <Indigo_Automaton> Directly in front of you above
[1:38:48] <sundizzle> at the edge of the cliff
[1:38:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:38:52] <sundizzle> its slightly above
[1:38:54] <Indigo_Automaton> UP
[1:38:59] <%krispen_wa> Just use Time Stop
[1:38:59] <Klefth> Look up
[1:39:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ye
[1:39:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> huzzah!
[1:39:15] <Indigo_Automaton> WOO
[1:39:16] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Gotta check your corners
[1:39:29] <sundizzle> so where are the people saying left now?
[1:39:43] <huskarl_zap> coom salamanders
[1:39:44] <+Grayhammatter> that's wha happun
[1:39:47] <%paladinstarbuster> poor lizer
[1:39:57] <%SainEdge> @sundizzle welcome to twitch chat LUL
[1:40:13] <OldManDeckardCain> @sundizzle they are definitely not right Kappa
[1:40:22] <balthazar758> sick
[1:40:25] <+tigerfang86> when twitch chat is wrong they just retreat into the shadows of the internet
[1:40:34] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ^^
[1:40:42] <samazam94> turns out we are the only ones thats left
[1:40:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Ahhh... familiar foe...
[1:41:00] <NDenizen> Miyazaki influence this character I believe
[1:41:00] <sundizzle> there's actually another one of these ALL the way at the beginning of the game
[1:41:01] <huskarl_zap> Jerk off oni
[1:41:06] <sundizzle> easy to miss
[1:41:06] <+tigerfang86> this guy ALSO vibin in a jar
[1:41:17] <Indigo_Automaton> LAPIS
[1:41:18] <Nyckelus> @sundizzle Woolie knows.
[1:41:35] <+penjaza> Mask important to get
[1:41:40] <sundizzle> Nyckelus ah I haven't caught up with the whole playthrough
[1:41:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's basically a slab in this game
[1:41:47] <%sirisvirus> mask is new game plus
[1:41:47] <sundizzle> not sure if he remembers though
[1:41:54] <NDenizen> Mask Fragment kinda sucks
[1:41:56] <+BurncoatRapscallion> God I can't remember the mask fragment thing. I remember it being bullshit or something
[1:41:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but end game stuffs require multiple slabs

[2:04:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> this glowing red eye fish with fucking teeth is good btw
[2:04:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That dude was a dick, the other dude just wanted to be a fish
[2:04:22] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> I'm currently going through a book of Chinese mythology and folklore, and like this side quest, the moral of the stories is often lost on me
[2:04:27] <convo445> beating bosses
[2:04:29] <Th3rd3> you can befriend the big fish
[2:04:31] <+b_aleph> oh yeah it's monke time

[2:04:57] <+Pinkiefan> At least the other dude is honest about wanting immortality. This guy‚Äôs a religious extremist.

[2:06:41] <sundizzle> actually important, has woolie eavesdropped on emma? it might lock him out of the secret boss
[2:06:42] <%Jiggisnipe> even with 13 Sentinels, people still used emotes to give info

[2:07:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:07:29] <ullyzeez> jump
[2:07:29] <+penjaza> No seriously though, you can't do the other endings after the next boss
[2:07:42] <huskarl_zap> BIGE ROPES = BIGE SPIRITS
[2:07:47] <dizimous> Wouldn't he get locked out of the other endings here potentially?
[2:07:48] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Yeah you do get locked out of certain content if it's not opened before this boss
[2:07:54] <NDenizen> If you want to do other endings, stop here
[2:07:58] <andre11dr> Yeah, this one is little ridiculous
[2:07:59] <sundizzle> you get locked out of the secret boss if you beat this boss
[2:08:08] <+penjaza> STOP HERE FOR OTHER ENDINGS
[2:08:09] <huskarl_zap> Tree big SPIRIT gib BIG belt
[2:08:10] <%sirisvirus> ya he needs to have done all requirements for all endings before this boss
[2:08:12] <%TopTieramisu> WHAT
[2:08:12] <%Lion_kun> If he beats the boss of this area, he won't be able to unlock the secret boss.
[2:08:13] <AShinyVagikarp> FeelsGoodMan
[2:08:13] <Kghaleon> Here we go
[2:08:15] <primaryfire> this is your cutoff for accessing the other endings

[2:09:05] <+penjaza> If you win, then it is
[2:09:05] <convo445> Minh isn't the sharpest tool in the shed
[2:09:06] <Klefth> This was the cutoff
[2:09:06] <arussoltzm> That means yes
[2:09:11] <vVAstrAVv> best from gimmick boss
[2:09:13] <+tigerfang86> FEAR THE OLD BLOOD
[2:09:14] <Nyckelus> It‚Äôs alright either way. All of the final bosses are cool.
[2:09:14] <shorololo> minh is responsible then
[2:09:16] <T_Sasquatch> Uh oh
[2:09:17] <ullyzeez> uhhh yes?
[2:09:20] <AnActualHermitCrab> Oooh this boss is sick.
[2:09:24] <%Lion_kun> You won't be able to fight the secret boss.
[2:09:27] <+Mendin> ELI?
[2:09:29] <T_Sasquatch> Hope Woolie backed up his save
[2:09:38] <NDenizen> You need to stop here and backup your save
[2:09:40] <+Mendin> It's Plague of Gripes
[2:09:43] <+tigerfang86> byeeeeeeeeee
[2:09:47] <samazam94> everyone point your fingers at minh after this
[2:09:48] <+Pinkiefan> Oh shoot, he hasn‚Äôt eavesdropped? Wasn‚Äôt that the whole point of doing this again? He can‚Äôt get the other boss now.
[2:09:50] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> monkaS cvHazmat
[2:09:51] <huskarl_zap> YOU RUNNIN?
[2:09:53] <convo445> back up your save
[2:09:55] <andre11dr> Byeeere bitch
[2:10:01] <Klefth> GOOD
[2:10:01] <CoffeeSlice> "WHY U RUNNIN"
[2:10:02] <sundizzle> you have to eavesdrop on emma
[2:10:03] <huskarl_zap> Just go

[2:10:04] <%AyotoCorp> Minh is wrong
[2:10:06] <NDenizen> ???
[2:10:06] <dizimous> Minh.
[2:10:07] <primaryfire> lmao
[2:10:08] <+JingKaisean> minh is wrong
[2:10:10] <+b_aleph> LUL
[2:10:11] <NDenizen> "i disagree with facts"
[2:10:11] <Klefth> Minh....
[2:10:11] <T_Sasquatch> Looooooooooooool
[2:10:11] <convo445> proof
[2:10:14] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> minh is so wrong lol
[2:10:15] <crimsonsaens> What is Minh's record today?
[2:10:17] <@akuda_bar> get right with the universe
[2:10:18] <shorololo> minh is super wrong
[2:10:18] <convo445> sure
[2:10:18] <sundizzle> you cannot eavesdrop on emma after you beat this boss @WoolieVersus
[2:10:18] <%SainEdge> jsut check the internet
[2:10:18] <ullyzeez> you need to die right now woolie
[2:10:21] <+klooswep> what other ending would he even be going for?
[2:10:25] <samazam94> time for save manipulation
[2:10:28] <%paladinstarbuster> ShowOfHands ShowOfHands ShowOfHands
[2:10:32] <+doe3879> I hate this showcase
[2:10:37] <vVAstrAVv> i feel like minks trollin and love it
[2:10:38] <CoffeeSlice> ah, so it's a stand similar to Crazy Talk huh
[2:10:38] <%AyotoCorp> Beating the boss is the point of no return
[2:10:39] <primaryfire> you gotta do the eavesdropping now or get locked out of the memory with the purification ending item
[2:10:40] <+JingKaisean> it triggers the invasion
[2:10:41] <%sirisvirus> no but it locks people out
[2:10:42] <ullyzeez> what?????
[2:10:42] <Indigo_Automaton> You get locked out of eavesdropping that is required for the true ending
[2:10:43] <jamox1> Wait how many endings does this game have???
[2:10:43] <sundizzle> no, but you have to unlock the hirata estate first
[2:10:44] <convo445> that's not what we're talking about
[2:10:47] <+penjaza> Killing the Dragon, moves characters so you can't do the talking needed for the endings
[2:10:48] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Emma is gone after this boss
[2:10:48] <ullyzeez> how do you disagree with a fact???
[2:10:52] <Klefth> It triggers the samurai
[2:10:52] <dizimous> Beating the dragon will trigger the invasion of ashina, and prevent him from talking to Sculptor, Ishinn and Emma
[2:10:55] <sundizzle> you can't talk to emma after this boss
[2:10:57] <%RyTYoung> Oh SHIT
[2:10:57] <%astrofizzix> I learned about the optional area immediately after finishing this boss, and was locked out
[2:10:58] <primaryfire> you can't eavesdrop on emma during the invasion
[2:10:59] <+JingKaisean> and if he hasn't unlocked the 2 other endings then he can't do that after this point
[2:11:00] <huskarl_zap> Did he do the monkeies and dream?
[2:11:01] <%Lion_kun> It's for the third ending. You gotta eavesdrop the sculptor.
[2:11:05] <%SainEdge> yeah but NPCs will not be available like before
[2:11:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he doesn't have the requirements for the dragon tears right? so once you finish the fight, you can't do what's needed to get the tears
[2:11:10] <+JingKaisean> he didn't kill owl (father)
[2:11:12] <%ChoculaUltra> if the invasion starts, he can't talk to the key NPCs, bruv
[2:11:14] <+legendofthom> you need the bell before beating this boss
[2:11:14] <convo445> npcs are gone after this
[2:11:14] <sundizzle> she's gone
[2:11:14] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Need to easedrop
[2:11:15] <Kghaleon> Did Woolie fight the secret boss?
[2:11:16] <+Conzanagi> The invasion locks out Harada Estate 2
[2:11:16] <%Lion_kun> Owl Father
[2:11:18] <+0BM0Z> after killing this boss the world changes
[2:11:19] <EX_shuffle> the eavesdrop you need will disappear
[2:11:21] <%Skullgod> you're locking him out of young owl
[2:11:21] <ullyzeez> bruh.....
[2:11:22] <+JingKaisean> and he didn't do the emma and divine child stuff
[2:11:24] <NDenizen> triggering this boss moves the game into the final phase which means certain paths get blocked off
[2:11:24] <+Das_Prints> Killing the dragon changes the world state.
[2:11:27] <primaryfire> emma is the one who suggests going to the memory
[2:11:28] <+b_aleph> you need to eat the rice and shit
[2:11:30] <+Pinkiefan> Can‚Äôt fight Owl if you miss the eavesdrop.
[2:11:32] <convo445> memory fight
[2:11:33] <+Mendin> You need to unlock/do Owl 2 now
[2:11:33] <andre11dr> Dis you?
[2:11:35] <sundizzle> you have to eat the rice and talk to kuro
[2:11:38] <%guyalex> hate this stupid shit in from games - why it gotta be like this? need 10 wikis for the story that'll be disappointing anyway
[2:11:39] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[2:11:40] <samazam94> Owl 2
[2:11:40] <+klooswep> you hear about the other path to immortal severance from emma
[2:11:41] <sundizzle> you have to eat the rice and talk to kuro @WoolieVersus
[2:11:42] <%SainEdge> LUL
[2:11:44] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:11:45] <AShinyVagikarp> LUL
[2:11:47] <%ChoculaUltra> good call Minh
[2:11:49] <Klefth> Memory owl, Minh
[2:11:50] <@Menitta> Oh no
[2:11:51] <LordOfThePoultry> you don't say LUL
[2:11:55] <convo445> Minh when werer you ever right?
[2:11:57] <andre11dr> So now what
[2:11:57] <%RyTYoung> Sekiro is a wild ride to keep track of its endings, I don't fault you Mihn doodbenny
[2:11:58] <sundizzle> @WoolieVersus you need to get kuro to eat the rice
[2:12:00] <+JingKaisean> If we're wrong, you can tell chat to eat shit
[2:12:00] <Th3rd3> trust the Universal Will
[2:12:06] <brunoberserk> SARCASM MODE
[2:12:08] <samazam94> thank you for being real, minh
[2:12:09] <+doe3879> just play the damn game
[2:12:14] <Prevot> fucking from soft
[2:12:17] <+penjaza> Yeah, you only get one area's worth of time to get the other endings
[2:12:17] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> No this is the best, I love having to look up all the obscure bullshit
[2:12:18] <Kghaleon> Might be too soon for that
[2:12:19] <Nyckelus> It‚Äôs alright Minh. Everybody gets things wrong.
[2:12:28] <Klefth> Yeah, I have no idea why they had to make this SO obtuse...
[2:12:31] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Except me :)
[2:12:33] <dizimous> FromSoft can not be stopped, I wish they wouldn't structure all their games like this
[2:12:34] <ullyzeez> i mean we can look at the fucking wiki minh
[2:12:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> What you want a Cyberpunk ending where you just choose a prompt??
[2:12:48] <sundizzle> @WoolieVersus you need to get the rice for kuro also
[2:12:49] <Kghaleon> I got all the endings in one go, because you can save immediately after beating the final boss.
[2:12:50] <+JingKaisean> don't listen to that g uy
[2:12:52] <+JingKaisean> listen to us
[2:12:54] <jamox1> Yooo
[2:12:55] <andre11dr> Just do whatever, this game came out 2 years ago, nobody carea
[2:12:58] <convo445> Sekiro, never play twice
[2:12:58] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> jermaOneguy
[2:13:01] <420mangojuice> just do it pepege
[2:13:01] <Klefth> Mr. OG
[2:13:01] <%RyTYoung> I thought I had the best ending, until I realised I hadn't eavesdropped in on ONE conversation
[2:13:02] <T_Sasquatch> Ignore one guy just do it
[2:13:04] <%astrofizzix> I missed an optional area and boss because of this exact situation (and I didn't have the Universe to stop me). Yeah, I kinda hate Sekiro for that.
[2:13:04] <+Pinkiefan> This is still my favorite Fromsoft game, but man they just have to put bs like this in every game.
[2:13:06] <jamox1> Imagine if this shit came out 18 years ago
[2:13:07] <%ChoculaUltra> don't be mad at us that From Soft loves being vague and obscure for flavor LUL
[2:13:08] <+yukichocomilk> mr. ONE GUY. please shut up LUL
[2:13:14] <%paladinstarbuster> woolieONEGUY woolieGIRLS
[2:13:15] <jamox1> Gotta check fucking game informer for this shit
[2:13:16] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> Sekiro: Can't Save Twice
[2:13:19] <NDenizen> To be fair the Old Lady gives you all the clues
[2:13:28] <convo445> content creators can not play the game twice guys
[2:13:31] <ullyzeez> get shot shia
[2:13:33] <primaryfire> :)
[2:13:34] <sundizzle> @WoolieVersus minh, he has to eat the rice and give the special rice to kuro
[2:13:35] <balthazar758> many one guy
[2:13:38] <dizimous> I'm glad it's actually just one boss that's locked like this but fuck
[2:13:38] <%RyTYoung> We are all woolieONEGUY at one point in our lives
[2:13:41] <Nyckelus> Legitimately though. Any ending is fine in the long run. You‚Äôll just miss out on one or two bosses.
[2:13:47] <%SainEdge> i mean two of the endings are easy to get, one is a bit tricky and one is stupidly convoluted LUL
[2:13:53] <dizimous> er, and a slightly new mini boss
[2:13:54] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> BabyRage Mr Streamer play the game like I want
[2:13:54] <Nyckelus> Depending on which one.
[2:13:58] <+nabs2099> To be fair I got hella respect for how you can actually deal with One Guy so Damn well.
[2:13:59] <thaprinnydood> doesnt most fromsoft games have multiple endings?
[2:14:07] <convo445> do now or find out later
[2:14:07] <ullyzeez> one guy is right next to you
[2:14:10] <+Pinkiefan> That one boss is considered one of the best fights in the game, though.
[2:14:13] <NDenizen> This game only has two actual ending paths
[2:14:16] <+penjaza> Get ready for the most obtuse shit yet
[2:14:18] <convo445> fuck around and find out
[2:14:18] <samazam94> hes doing it for the bossfights
[2:14:25] <dizimous> YUP
[2:14:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> it better have the bullshit cranked up to Infinity
[2:14:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:14:33] <andre11dr> You know it will
[2:14:33] <DatAsuna> well most of the endings have the same fight
[2:14:34] <sundizzle> chat, have they done the rice for kuro part?
[2:14:35] <+JingKaisean> elden ring will probably not let you replay the game
[2:14:36] <Indigo_Automaton> It definitely will LUL
[2:14:36] <+JingKaisean> no NG+
[2:14:42] <Th3rd3> you're gonna get a bad ending if your horse gets killed in Elden Ring
[2:14:44] <+Grayhammatter> it definitely will
[2:14:51] <convo445> some people have done it legit but not streamers
[2:14:52] <ChoculaUltra> bosses that can only be fought at specific times on certain days of the month, under certain lunar cycles LUL
[2:14:57] <T_Sasquatch> Souls games are best played a year after everyone's found the good shit Kappa
[2:15:04] <NDenizen> It's true that the DS3 NPC situation is godawful
[2:15:07] <420mangojuice> 4k elden ring FeelsGoodMan
[2:15:08] <convo445> this is a hell of your own making
[2:15:10] <%RyTYoung> Oh my god Elden Ring is going to have a secret code on the back of the box that is a different code for each game copy, and it reveals a secret boss for the best ending, digital only buyers have no access to it LUL
[2:15:26] <andre11dr> But this is the only game with multiple final bosses so it is more BS in that sense
[2:15:32] <NDenizen> walk into a doorway and NPCs magically die
[2:15:35] <GeoffGeofreed> Elden Ring will have endings lock behind an NPC that will die when you take two steps further away from them
[2:15:38] <Afroperonista> @JingKaisean nor play it because it's never coming out LUL
[2:15:41] <jamox1> @woolieversus Elden Ring is gonna make you post a positive comment about GRR taking so long to make the next book.
[2:15:46] <samazam94> @rytyoung thats not fromsoft. thats kojima
[2:15:48] <balthazar758> save file defeated
[2:15:50] <ullyzeez> unless they let GRMM write the ending and all we get is a non ending
[2:15:51] <jamox1> To get the secret sending
[2:15:52] <convo445> y'all are so mad to play a game more than once, it's understandable for youtubers or whatnot
[2:15:53] <brunoberserk> they REALLY want to people to replay the game multiples and multiples time
[2:16:04] <%RyTYoung> @samazam94 shit your right I'm thinking way too obtuse LUL
[2:16:04] <+JingKaisean> casual that you are, elden ring has already come out and you've beaten it, but you just don't know which game you played
[2:16:04] <DatAsuna> fromsoft is the boss
[2:16:04] <sundizzle> have they given the rice to kuro and talked to the divine child?
[2:16:13] <Kghaleon> Undertale literally has a boss like that
[2:16:20] <Flare3500> Finish the game
[2:16:22] <%Bluwizard21> you didnt beat this guy in the first 30 minutes of the game? Bad End
[2:16:24] <DatAsuna> gimme that boktai shit
[2:16:26] <+b_aleph> eat rice and shit
[2:16:26] <420mangojuice> from always had convoluted endings for ng+
[2:16:28] <brunoberserk> probably eavesdrop emma ?
[2:16:31] <primaryfire> eavesdrop on kuro, rest, speak to emma iirc
[2:16:33] <Indigo_Automaton> Are you holding your controller upside down? No? BAD END
[2:16:39] <+legendofthom> have you the bell from owl?
[2:16:41] <%RyTYoung> @indigo_automaton LUL
[2:16:42] <sundizzle> you need the rice for kuro from the divine child
[2:16:44] <@Menitta> universe doesnt even know LUL
[2:16:44] <+JingKaisean> do the memory first, it's the cooler ending
[2:16:46] <dizimous> More eavesdroping I believe
[2:16:50] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Keep resting at Ashina Castle until you eavesdrop on Kuro, then talk to Emma about it iirc
[2:16:50] <%ChoculaUltra> I miss shouting taiyo while holding my gameboy in sunspots FeelsBadMan
[2:16:51] <speximillian> Go fight the Toilet Goblins
[2:16:54] <AShinyVagikarp> Eat a rice ball Kappa
[2:16:56] <+Grayhammatter> universe doesn'r know LUL
[2:17:01] <thebalticguy1> The problems with not playing a game for months
[2:17:02] <dizimous> Y'all might wanna guide, it's o specific
[2:17:02] <+b_aleph> EAT RICE AND SHIT
[2:17:05] <+bunchaghosts> not finishing on the final boss is odd?
[2:17:06] <ullyzeez> damn i was expecting chat to not type for a while like last time
[2:17:07] <crimsonsaens> Which ending does he want?
[2:17:15] <+shootbang_exe> is there not an endings guide we can link minh to?
[2:17:16] <+Pinkiefan> I used a guide
[2:17:17] <unrelenting0> Just check your inventory for a particular Bell. If you have it, you don't have to mess around with more eavesdropping.
[2:17:18] <%LCLSmoothie> eat a jelly donut
[2:17:20] <%SainEdge> maybe just do the normal ending first?
[2:17:21] <%KiwamiKiryu> We don't know why would you ask?
[2:17:21] <sundizzle> YES
[2:17:21] <andre11dr> There's multiple things you can do so you gotta choose one
[2:17:23] <Kghaleon> but you'd have to fight the boss again, instead of just checking
[2:17:25] <crimsonsaens> no
[2:17:27] <%jinking79> wat has Woolie finished?
[2:17:27] <+penjaza> Get all the endings prior and you can choose which one you want at the ened
[2:17:28] <vVAstrAVv> i think you have to give the devine child stuff
[2:17:28] <brunoberserk> kinda
[2:17:29] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Sorta?
[2:17:30] <andre11dr> 2 are
[2:17:32] <sundizzle> the return ending is incredibly different
[2:17:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> i keep forgetting minh also has to this shit woolieGLORY
[2:17:34] <dizimous> Content wise no, story wise yes
[2:17:37] <samazam94> different boss fights
[2:17:38] <thebalticguy1> gmaeplay wise no, but story wise yes
[2:17:39] <DatAsuna> nah
[2:17:39] <+yukichocomilk> I just wanna see him fight all the bosse stbh
[2:17:41] <%SainEdge> yes, but not the gameplay/content
[2:17:47] <Indigo_Automaton> He could always just watch the endings
[2:17:48] <DatAsuna> thematically different
[2:17:49] <convo445> there will be different endings
[2:17:50] <samazam94> *no
[2:17:52] <KaiserMario> You guys forget that in Dark Souls, you can't talk to the Fair Lady unless you chose the Old Witch's Ring as a starting gift OR if you trade it with Snuggly, and you have to know it's a Sunlight Maggot trade
[2:17:53] <samuelfisk> You just need to unlock the one area.
[2:17:53] <DatAsuna> substantively similar
[2:17:59] <convo445> like muramasa endings#
[2:18:02] <%Lion_kun> One ending has a secret boss.
[2:18:04] <ullyzeez> no you get a diff cutscene
[2:18:09] <+Pinkiefan> Now that you have the save it‚Äôs all good.
[2:18:23] <primaryfire> the endings are not mutually exclusive except the bad one
[2:18:30] <andre11dr> So where doing this first, ok
[2:18:32] <Flare3500> here's your reward 5 spirit emblems
[2:18:34] <%KiwamiKiryu> Someone ask Vaati
[2:18:43] <ullyzeez> "do you wanna pray"
[2:18:49] <convo445> if we stop here it will be enough
[2:18:49] <crimsonsaens> I hate this boss
[2:18:54] <miltoned91> miyazaki and his feet fetish
[2:18:55] <vVAstrAVv> the tute reward was the carps we made along the way
[2:18:58] <convo445> it's like 5 minutes
[2:18:59] <NDenizen> This boss is great
[2:19:09] <huskarl_zap> COOF COOF
[2:19:13] <Zayasu> my favorite boss! :)
[2:19:19] <huskarl_zap> BALICIOUS BUSH MEAT
[2:19:25] <convo445> grapple
[2:19:28] <thebalticguy1> GRAPPLE
[2:19:31] <+tigerfang86> YEAH
[2:19:32] <miltoned91> this is the most art√≠stic and beautiful boss fight.
[2:19:33] <andre11dr> For a set piece boss, it's one of the better ones
[2:19:38] <dizimous> WHAT, I NEVER DID THAT
[2:19:38] <Indigo_Automaton> PogChamp
[2:19:39] <+BurncoatRapscallion> So good
[2:19:39] <+Mendin> DANCE WATER DANCE
[2:19:44] <+NocturnePsycho> i didnt know you could do that lmao
[2:19:45] <crimsonsaens> That's poison
[2:19:51] <%SainEdge> love that move Kreygasm
[2:19:54] <%baronblank> this boss always creeped me out super hard and I don't know why
[2:19:57] <convo445> pinwheel 2
[2:20:00] <sundizzle> I don't think you guys have done the rice part, you need to get it from the divine child and give it to kuro before this boss @WoolieVersus
[2:20:20] <+Grayhammatter> dance water dance!
[2:20:23] <CoffeeSlice> LETS GOOOO
[2:20:29] <NDenizen> yeyeyeye
[2:20:33] <Nyckelus> Alright, cool part go!
[2:20:34] <@Solidus_113> @sundizzle they made a backup save before this
[2:20:37] <Indigo_Automaton> @baronblank For me it's Megalophobia
[2:20:44] <Kghaleon> Screw it, Woolie can see the other endings on youtube.
[2:20:46] <%RyTYoung> yeyeyeye
[2:20:47] <+0BM0Z> music here is gorgeous
[2:20:48] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Excised the rot, get revived tree

[2:21:21] <huskarl_zap> yes
[2:21:23] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:21:24] <%SainEdge> AngelThump
[2:21:24] <OldManDeckardCain> filler blade
[2:21:25] <redrins> you mean bishamontens blade?
[2:21:25] <%Jiggisnipe> Woolie always references Naruto Kappa
[2:21:27] <Prevot> the ace attorney sword
[2:21:27] <@Solidus_113> That sword is also in Okami, the 9 Tails uses it
[2:21:29] <NDenizen> this track is a banger
[2:21:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:21:36] <KaiserMario> Does Woolie not know what that sword is?
[2:21:37] <andre11dr> It's based on a real sword Woolie
[2:21:37] <glass_marcus> 7 path sword isn't naruto specific at all tho
[2:21:38] <%ZweihanderSteve> seven pronged sword. its a mythology thing
[2:21:38] <+bunchaghosts> based on a mythic sword in rl lore?
[2:21:39] <ullyzeez> @convo445 its hard to type man
[2:21:40] <%RyTYoung> Favourite fight in the game for me
[2:21:41] <convo445> nah that sacred treasure sword that's totally a real treasure from the king of korea

[2:21:52] <%RyTYoung> @b_aleph WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT
[2:21:55] <+Pinkiefan> Lol, I just looked up the steps and it‚Äôs even worse than I remembered. So many steps in a specific order at multiple different places. It‚Äôs basically a trading quest.
[2:21:56] <Ner234> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:21:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Parry this
[2:22:01] <+BurncoatRapscallion> This is a gimick boss done right

[2:22:22] <%SainEdge> best gimmick fight
[2:22:24] <AnActualHermitCrab> nice n rad
[2:22:29] <Flare3500> You can deflect those wind slashes
[2:22:30] <+Mendin> Throw lightning at a god dragon
[2:22:31] <NDenizen> no confirmation but a fan theory is that this sword is the stand-in for the MLGS
[2:22:32] <tattleworm> the first good bed of chaos type boss
[2:22:36] <%paladinstarbuster> Its like skyward sword
[2:22:39] <+JingKaisean> so I see they're just gonna watch the other endings on youtube?
[2:22:45] <agustorm123> loosing to gimick boss LUL
[2:22:51] <ullyzeez> best From gimmick boss
[2:22:52] <convo445> nah the sword is modeled after a real national treasure that an old korean king gave to japan
[2:22:56] <andre11dr> That sword is totally based on a real sword
[2:23:08] <samazam94> one of the better gimmick boss in the series
[2:23:14] <andre11dr> The Susano sword or whatever
[2:23:16] <agustorm123> KEKW
[2:23:18] <+BurncoatRapscallion> @convo445 Oh word? That's super cool
[2:23:20] <+Pinkiefan> So chat, I liked Sekiro and DS1, but haven‚Äôt played any of the other soulsborne games. Which should I play next?
[2:23:25] <huskarl_zap> WHEN YOU DIE WHEN YOU DIE
[2:23:31] <+JingKaisean> @Pinkiefan Bloodborne
[2:23:33] <%ChoculaUltra> Bloodborne or DS3
[2:23:42] <NoireRequiem> Minh is INH
[2:23:44] <NDenizen> best part
[2:23:46] <+Mendin> @Pinkiefan Bloodborne
[2:23:49] <andre11dr> @pinkiefan I'd say DS3
[2:23:51] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:23:54] <Sparda_blizzard> getting ichimonged by a dragon
[2:23:58] <Draco_Renegade> Bloodborne > DS3
[2:24:01] <Flare3500> Posture is life GG those with Scoliosis
[2:24:08] <NDenizen> this music is gorgeous right here
[2:24:08] <%SainEdge> monkaS
[2:24:09] <glass_marcus> bb
[2:24:14] <samazam94> DS2 is also good and dont let other people tell you otherwise
[2:24:22] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Can't you parry this?
[2:24:23] <+Mendin> Repuuken
[2:24:23] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is the better game but DS3 haa so much more in it
[2:24:25] <%SainEdge> music AngelThump
[2:24:25] <ullyzeez> bro just fucking grapple wtf
[2:24:26] <vVAstrAVv> woolie...
[2:24:26] <+Mendin> Double Repuuken
[2:24:29] <Flare3500> Deflecting will help tho
[2:24:30] <KaiserMario> Dragon pulling the Storm ruler on you
[2:24:32] <convo445> for a weeb you guys know very little about japan
[2:24:36] <moeartifact> you can deflect
[2:24:42] <Kghaleon> laaame
[2:24:43] <AShinyVagikarp> F
[2:24:45] <+b_aleph> LUL
[2:24:47] <+Grayhammatter> F
[2:24:50] <%paladinstarbuster> actually this sorta reminds me of muramasa the demon blade. Ninja's fighting gods and shut
[2:24:52] <thebalticguy1> ive never seen someone die to that boss
[2:24:55] <%SainEdge> LUL
[2:24:58] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:25:01] <ullyzeez> woolie forgot about the L1 button
[2:25:03] <+Pinkiefan> Ok cool. Sound like everyone‚Äôs in agreement either BB or DS3. Thanks. If I don‚Äôt get burnt out from those I‚Äôll do DS2. Bed of Chaos was not fun and I almost quit.
[2:25:09] <+BurncoatRapscallion> At least try. I've never seen anyone go through the game not mashing the block/deflect button
[2:25:11] <Chester_goes_Berserk> It's secretly a metal gear rising sequel: parry everything
[2:25:13] <vVAstrAVv> my dissapointment is immesurable... and my day is ruined
[2:25:14] <+b_aleph> @thebalticguy1 me neither
[2:25:20] <convo445> for pinwheel 2 this sure is a taking one more try
[2:25:24] <ullyzeez> died to a gimmick boss LUL
[2:25:27] <%hax_metatron> Woolie doesn't even defend against arrows bruh
[2:25:28] <%nintenbren> if you go to the secret area before the boss you won't have to reload the save. you can get all the good endings at once
[2:25:29] <@Solidus_113> would mortal blade big swings help here?
[2:25:31] <huskarl_zap> coof coof
[2:25:47] <worldbrand> lmao
[2:25:49] <%Lion_kun> Can you mikiri him?
[2:25:49] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:25:50] <convo445> come on
[2:25:50] <%RyTYoung> YE
[2:25:51] <Flare3500> Why would you need mortal blade just kingdom hearts 2 reaction command that shit
[2:25:55] <jamox1> I think Woolie would explode if he could parry god
[2:25:57] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:26:05] <convo445> like ice skating on marbles
[2:26:10] <andre11dr> Bed of Chaos is actually unfinished, easily the worst Souls boss
[2:26:16] <@Menitta> Like Zone of the Enders 2
[2:26:19] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Pigg1yJuffs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! I need to catch up on the channel with this playthrough, but wishing you luck. Hopefully once I'm fully moved into my new place, I'll have the time.
[2:26:28] <+tigerfang86> it really is all the fromsoft games that bring the worst chatters
[2:26:49] <%RyTYoung> I'm so glad Woolie continued this playthrough BibleThump
[2:26:50] <andre11dr> Well that and that one DS2 boss that's just a bunch of guys
[2:26:55] <huskarl_zap> SHENRON WITH A CACTUS SWORD
[2:26:55] <+NoHopeForMyCuirass> Beautiful music
[2:27:04] <convo445> woolie isn't trying to be optimistic either
[2:27:07] <worldbrand> im glad woolie got to see this
[2:27:14] <ullyzeez> okay lets goooo
[2:27:34] <LoreKeeper_Thal> this boss is super sick
[2:27:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dragon God: but good
[2:27:37] <dds333a> Dragon got the Kusanagi on deck

[2:45:58] <+0BM0Z> you have to parry it
[2:45:58] <Indigo_Automaton> Or parry
[2:45:59] <sundizzle> if you perfect parry, he doesn't do any chip damage
[2:45:59] <+JingKaisean> look at the spark
[2:46:00] <+BurncoatRapscallion> You have to parry
[2:46:00] <Klefth> lol
[2:46:01] <%TopTieramisu> "don't get caught" -man who got caught
[2:46:02] <brunoberserk> ashina cross is the shit
[2:46:03] <Klefth> Parry
[2:46:04] <+Qexec> sidestep LUL
[2:46:05] <%ZweihanderSteve> wow. very cool swings
[2:46:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it becomes a rhythm game
[2:46:07] <%Lion_kun> Block at flash
[2:46:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> *Piccolo:* D O D G E
[2:46:10] <convo445> what's parries?
[2:46:10] <kulmoth> just perfect parry 4Head
[2:46:10] <dds333a> @0bm0z too an extent, anyway. there are things that are strong despite working as they're supposed to
[2:46:11] <Flare3500> Parry do not be scurred
[2:46:11] <plaguedoctor_syan> Or use fire
[2:46:12] <samazam94> Cut you down!
[2:46:14] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Does woolie hate parrying?
[2:46:16] <moeartifact> it was enemies like this that made me realize that you really can't rely on dodging
[2:46:18] <Nyckelus> Can‚Äôt afford to not party against this guy.
[2:46:21] <$horse_oil> that's half the bosses in this game tbh
[2:46:22] <%jinking79> watch the hand still take time
[2:46:22] <+JingKaisean> block everything
[2:46:24] <thefranchise00> Reacting to this guy is tough
[2:46:27] <ullyzeez> PARRY IT WTF
[2:46:28] <+JingKaisean> just literally block everything in this game
[2:46:32] <+MacDatAss> you have to perfect parry
[2:46:34] <$horse_oil> there's a little spark visual cue before he draws
[2:46:36] <+0BM0Z> dds333a you're playing on bitch mode if you're playing with umbrella anyway, remove charm and ring demon bell
[2:46:42] <plaguedoctor_syan> every one that has red eyes is week against fire
[2:46:46] <Robot_Nixon_> just perfect parry 4Head
[2:46:47] <Flare3500> Sunhi Legends is Cool and there is also Ongbal who's basically Donguri of Sekiro
[2:46:48] <$horse_oil> nice
[2:46:57] <huskarl_zap> damn jab masher
[2:46:57] <+b_aleph> just git gud
[2:47:03] <huskarl_zap> interuppted your turn
[2:47:06] <dds333a> Just short
[2:47:10] <+JingKaisean> stop jumping
[2:47:13] <+JingKaisean> jumping worthless
[2:47:14] <wqorst> he said no
[2:47:15] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:47:16] <%Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:47:17] <%TopTieramisu> don't trade with this dude
[2:47:17] <Who_lio42> the Ashina Cross...beware the 2nd swallow
[2:47:17] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:47:17] <+AdlerDynamic> woolie does love to jump
[2:47:18] <dds333a> Damn
[2:47:20] <Klefth> F O O T S I E S
[2:47:22] <%ZweihanderSteve> no sell woolieFUN
[2:47:22] <+b_aleph> become daigo umehara
[2:47:23] <Ner234> Sit DOWN
[2:47:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Nunavut
[2:47:26] <%baronblank> yup, gotta learn the parry there
[2:47:26] <andre11dr> Wolf vs Ukyo is 9-1 matchup confirmed
[2:47:27] <%paladinstarbuster> He's real you cant play hi,
[2:47:31] <sundizzle> JingKaisean not worthless, he does a sweep attack that you have to attack over
[2:47:37] <sundizzle> jump over*
[2:47:42] <ullyzeez> LUL
[2:47:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> Just wake up lvl 3
[2:47:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> equip gun
[2:48:04] <convo445> obviously this a battle of not clashing swords
[2:48:04] <+JingKaisean> he has to trigger it for him to do it, but he's getting hit on the ashina cross
[2:48:08] <+JingKaisean> so it'll never happen
[2:48:09] <Who_lio42> i LOVE nightjar
[2:48:10] <eiyuusyndrome> use yokai shift and burst counter him obviously
[2:48:10] <danknugglit> Double ichi is king
[2:48:10] <ullyzeez> the last boss is gonna take a while if this keeps up
[2:48:13] <huskarl_zap> We don;t smoke nightjar
[2:48:16] <Flare3500> Constantly jumping in this game, is basically jumping backwards in Street Fighter
[2:48:20] <huskarl_zap> straight edge
[2:48:30] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Jumping in this game is wake up-dp
[2:48:35] <Nyckelus> Nightjar Reverse is okay for hit and run strats but pretty bad on attack.
[2:48:45] <andre11dr> Use your Roman Cancels, duh
[2:48:45] <Th3rd3> YeYe YeYe
[2:48:55] <$horse_oil> woolie going sicko mode
[2:49:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yes! Be aggressive!
[2:49:10] <splinter1619> dayum that damage
[2:49:11] <+tigerfang86> shifitin into SICKO MODE
[2:49:11] <samazam94> i dont know why but woolie's random jumps cracks me up man
[2:49:13] <sundizzle> you don't actually even need to do damage on this guy
[2:49:14] <CoffeeSlice> YEYEYE AGGRESIVE
[2:49:23] <%ChoculaUltra> the feint!
[2:49:23] <splinter1619> F
[2:49:24] <danknugglit> Jebaited
[2:49:24] <%ZweihanderSteve> COOL
[2:49:24] <dds333a> FEINTED
[2:49:24] <convo445> Pat was very perceptive of these dudes, he could fare better than most of chat
[2:49:25] <kulmoth> aited
[2:49:25] <Th3rd3> that pretty good tho
[2:49:25] <+b_aleph> use the fire barrell
[2:49:27] <+JingKaisean> that was good
[2:49:27] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Think deemon soulz: fights are puzzles.
[2:49:33] <%jinking79> Footize
[2:49:36] <Kghaleon> You can also lure him away from the room, and when he turns around backstab him
[2:49:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:49:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> Hesitation is defete
[2:49:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> that was so cool woolieYE
[2:49:49] <brunoberserk> COF COF
[2:49:52] <Flare3500> He has cancer , am cured
[2:49:54] <ullyzeez> flinched
[2:49:56] <420mangojuice> oh shit here we go again
[2:49:58] <Nyckelus> I love the small jab he does. The weakest attack but can combo into the strongest.
[2:50:02] <sundizzle> from software are cowards
[2:50:07] <+0BM0Z> ye everyone feels that way
[2:50:15] <Indigo_Automaton> That's probably the case
[2:50:15] <%TopTieramisu> yeah
[2:50:16] <splinter1619> just like the death arm in senuas sacrifice
[2:50:17] <NDenizen> pretty sure rot was meant to be for revives, not actual deaths
[2:50:19] <%jinking79> thanks Activision
[2:50:19] <convo445> and they did die, it's on the cutting room floor, there's no speculation needed
[2:50:21] <Flare3500> I literally was too cruel , Original Dark Souls would delete your save if you die
[2:50:21] <huskarl_zap> Theres plenty of tears too
[2:50:26] <NDenizen> they definitely changed it at the last moment
[2:50:29] <DatAsuna> They did have to be told be activision to put in tutorials lol
[2:50:37] <Kghaleon> Watch his hands, you'll see the timing when you parry
[2:50:37] <samazam94> its too cruel to the player
[2:50:48] <danknugglit> Hesitation is defeat
[2:50:51] <+askalta> poison and flame
[2:50:57] <Indigo_Automaton> To be fair the NPC's don't deserve to die for your fuckups
[2:50:59] <convo445> npcs did for real die, there's code and dialogue for it all
[2:51:01] <%TopTieramisu> @Flare3500 eh... that was an idea miyazaki considered in demon's souls but abandoned early in production
[2:51:07] <+MacDatAss> that ashina boy doesnt mess around
[2:51:11] <Nyckelus> I believe poison also hinders posture, right?
[2:51:21] <ullyzeez> just do it
[2:51:24] <andre11dr> It does
[2:51:25] <sundizzle> its another one of those things like making your own bonfire that was just a lie
[2:51:26] <+askalta> cool
[2:51:27] <Th3rd3> Ohhhhhh
[2:51:29] <@Solidus_113> clean
[2:51:30] <splinter1619> Chad woolie
[2:51:31] <GeoffGeofreed> they could have just made it so the vendors sell less stuff as a punishment for the dragon aids
[2:51:31] <%ChoculaUltra> that was sick
[2:51:33] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[2:51:34] <dds333a> WOOLIE
[2:51:35] <+b_aleph> subarashi

[2:51:59] <Kghaleon> greedy
[2:52:00] <huskarl_zap> Grabbing bodies is in the DS3 files so it wasnt a total lie
[2:52:01] <Flare3500> Woolie finally getting confident instead of constantly jumping backwards
[2:52:01] <danknugglit> Close
[2:52:01] <%baronblank> so close
[2:52:01] <%ZweihanderSteve> so close woolieGLORY
[2:52:02] <%jinking79> Don't get to greedy

[2:52:07] <T_Sasquatch> You hate to see it
[2:52:08] <Who_lio42> i woulda done the same
[2:52:11] <Nyckelus> GREED
[2:52:11] <pjbuster> I mean that was a pretty good try
[2:52:12] <convo445> there's commiting

[2:52:17] <%Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[2:52:23] <NDenizen> Yeah NOT for that enemy rofl
[2:52:24] <@Menitta> "just do it" "no not like that"
[2:52:25] <+NocturnePsycho> in sekiro you kinda gotta be greedy lol
[2:52:26] <DatAsuna> be greedy but be good
[2:52:26] <%paladinstarbuster> only be greedy when you got it
[2:52:26] <%Jiggisnipe> WOOLIE JUST BE PERFECT
[2:52:27] <420mangojuice> just be perfect
[2:52:27] <+askalta> the mortal draw outrages his ashina cross
[2:52:30] <Chester_goes_Berserk> just do it perfect
[2:52:31] <thefranchise00> Don't lose your aggressive "flow state"!
[2:52:32] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Being aggressive isn't being greedy. You don't drop all defense when you go in
[2:52:33] <convo445> you need to expand your definition of greed
[2:52:34] <+tigerfang86> "Do this!" "no NOT LIKE THAT REEEEE"
[2:52:34] <splinter1619> WOOLIE JUST DONT DIE
[2:52:36] <%ZweihanderSteve> greedy but not do greedy i guess LUL
[2:52:37] <Jashter18> Just do it fourhead
[2:52:42] <sundizzle> this is the one guy where you actually can't be greedy
[2:52:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> This game is super seat of your pants
[2:52:50] <%TopTieramisu> hyper armor
[2:52:51] <TonberryLives> YEP
[2:52:53] <pjbuster> Bloodborne and this game are definitely the "Go in." type of games.
[2:52:53] <splinter1619> This feels like the advice I get when i try to play bloodborne
[2:52:56] <realfiction> This is the greediest FromSoft game
[2:52:57] <andre11dr> just be godlike at the game, you know ,like me Kappa
[2:53:04] <ullyzeez> you got this
[2:53:06] <T_Sasquatch> Be greedy except when you're not meant to be
[2:53:14] <splinter1619> Bruh moment
[2:53:17] <Indigo_Automaton> He fast
[2:53:17] <Ravenrooke> Pressing buttons
[2:53:17] <danknugglit> Oof
[2:53:18] <%paladinstarbuster> COUNTER
[2:53:19] <sundizzle> so how about that greediness
[2:53:20] <%TopTieramisu> footsies
[2:53:21] <+yukichocomilk> this mini boss is such a god
[2:53:23] <%jinking79> Smells the greed
[2:53:25] <+JonathLP> JUMP
[2:53:26] <ullyzeez> sweep
[2:53:29] <Majiinbooh> this is the, "can you parry?" skill check
[2:53:30] <+b_aleph> do the same thing you're doing now but well
[2:53:31] <$horse_oil> enemies can actually parry you as well (when there's a spark) which gives them more frames to attack you
[2:53:33] <+NerevaRising> Has Woolie tried gettin good yet??
[2:53:37] <+AdlerDynamic> dude is just training you
[2:53:39] <huskarl_zap> you have to perfect him so healing is a waste really
[2:53:43] <dds333a> he's getting in Woolie's head
[2:53:46] <andre11dr> He feels bitch in your hart
[2:53:52] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:53:55] <TonberryLives> You can dodge to the side right before his quick draw
[2:53:56] <NDenizen> Honestly this is all good practice
[2:54:08] <+RJay80> do you fear the man who has practice 1000 slashes once or the man who has praticed 1 slash 1000 times woolie
[2:54:10] <+JonathLP> tighten up the graphics on level 3
[2:54:13] <convo445> middle of the room is perfect neutral
[2:54:18] <+MacDatAss> LUL sneak preview of charmless run
[2:54:22] <splinter1619> big punish
[2:54:25] <huskarl_zap> he doesnt flinch ever
[2:54:35] <+AdlerDynamic> footsies
[2:54:36] <danknugglit> Tekken?
[2:54:38] <Flare3500> Climb up the stairs to heal
[2:54:44] <Who_lio42> you have a whole nother room to maneuever the fight into
[2:54:44] <OblivionSword1> we Tekken now
[2:54:47] <moeartifact> woolie really thought he was gonna psyche him out lmao
[2:54:49] <Who_lio42> for more space
[2:54:50] <wqorst> losing to guy who only knows two moves
[2:54:53] <pjbuster> the other guy is playing samsho fr
[2:54:53] <Nyckelus> Only footsies against this guy.
[2:54:54] <huskarl_zap> Playing tekken on steam with all these cheats he gets
[2:55:01] <sundizzle> its ALL footsies
[2:55:03] <+b_aleph> become daigo
[2:55:06] <%jinking79> boss with the Korean backdash
[2:55:07] <$horse_oil> honestly this dude is probably the hardest miniboss in the game
[2:55:08] <%paladinstarbuster> Gotta teat it like that one match of sam sho
[2:55:11] <usurper_sos> He only has the best two moves though
[2:55:18] <NDenizen> Woolie use your heat moves
[2:55:35] <sundizzle> he's going to reset
[2:55:38] <Flare3500> Yeah yeah up the stairs
[2:55:39] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:55:40] <%Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:55:43] <TonberryLives> There's also the thing with the red eyes
[2:55:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:55:45] <%dreadedcthulhu> the havel strategy
[2:55:48] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:55:49] <$horse_oil> also if you parry, you don't take posture damage even if you're maxed out
[2:55:52] <Majiinbooh> if u can react, this miniboss is really just 3/4 parries in a row, twice
[2:55:54] <+b_aleph> USE FIRE
[2:55:57] <%ryogeo> @WoolieVersus let go woolie
[2:56:01] <sundizzle> GREED
[2:56:03] <danknugglit> Must have been the wind
[2:56:04] <%ZweihanderSteve> mizuo, known for his fear of stairs LUL
[2:56:07] <%paladinstarbuster> "bring dat ass here"
[2:56:10] <+b_aleph> BURN HIS ASS
[2:56:12] <dds333a> Death in two steps, this guy
[2:56:15] <brunoberserk> woolieOMG AAAAAAAA
[2:56:23] <%Zanzibar_Junker> STFU Chat
[2:56:28] <usurper_sos> Never let go
[2:56:31] <Kghaleon> technically if Woolie was taking a pip off with ambush, he'd have won several times by now. He's doing it legit.
[2:56:33] <Flare3500> Don't let it go as per Elsa
[2:56:33] <+b_aleph> Red eys mean he's afraid of fire
[2:56:34] <T_Sasquatch> Let's go LUL
[2:56:37] <+Grayhammatter> never let go
[2:56:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19

[2:56:41] <+MacDatAss> imo i think the punish is to risky
[2:56:44] <+Kevorkm> umbrella strong here
[2:56:44] <+NerevaRising> He meant "Lets go Woolie"
[2:56:47] <+JonathLP> he ain't worth it
[2:56:49] <+FuqBoiSlim> Say the line chat!

[2:57:03] <sundizzle> woolie you don't even need to do damage
[2:57:11] <+Gloom_Tangerine> He has red eyes, try fire
[2:57:12] <GeoffGeofreed> The best way in my opinion is to just keep baiting his Ia Slash attack everytime
[2:57:15] <bengali_bhai> Woolie will figure it out
[2:57:31] <ullyzeez> woolie you need to move on man
[2:57:36] <CoffeeSlice> if he has red eyes, isnt fire gonna deal more damage onto him?
[2:57:37] <sundizzle> woolie stop using firebombs
[2:57:38] <dds333a> Woolie WILL figure it out

[3:02:27] <sundizzle> Kghaleon let him discover it naturally
[3:02:43] <+BurncoatRapscallion> We have to reload for other endings so he'll get to everything before he's done forever
[3:02:51] <+yukichocomilk> it's easy to miss the demon

[3:03:29] <sundizzle> BurncoatRapscallion technically, he could've unlocked all 3 of the other endings already, but he just didn't do the last bit

[3:07:35] <ullyzeez> LUL
[3:07:38] <CoffeeSlice> that difficulty spike is great
[3:07:39] <huskarl_zap> mother fuckers are nailing mid air shots with smoothbore muzzle loaders
[3:07:41] <andre11dr> I do like how fire works in this game, i hope they keep it like this in Elden Ring
[3:07:51] <brunoberserk> dont fuck with the ministry gang
[3:07:54] <Nyckelus> It‚Äôs almost like these guys are way better funded!
[3:08:18] <+tigerfang86> who would win, some hick small province in the mountains
[3:08:32] <+tigerfang86> or the actual japanese empire (?)
[3:08:45] <andre11dr> It would be cool if you could stack poison and fire on an enemy for mega dot ,that's some Darkest Dungeon shit
[3:08:59] <+Mendin> Well the province did until their lynchpin grandpa ate shit and some random shinobi murked half their good soldiers
[3:09:00] <+JingKaisean> @tigerfang86 neither, 1 man with a revolver
[3:09:18] <%jinking79> good time saver idol
[3:09:21] <dds333a> Yeah, it would be awesome if they could mega stack
[3:09:26] <+tigerfang86> LARGE

[3:09:42] <+DragonArt07> guy on bridge

[3:09:43] <T_Sasquatch> Woof
[3:09:43] <420mangojuice> F
[3:09:45] <+Grayhammatter> F
[3:09:48] <+Breaknoon> HUGH DRUGS
[3:09:50] <@Solidus_113> Murakumo is such a cool sword
[3:09:54] <Huntercd> Oh snap is that Minh?
[3:09:59] <%jinking79> RUN
[3:10:00] <Flare3500> Will Smith : That's Hot , That's Hot
[3:10:04] <Nyckelus> This guys the same as ever but fire!
[3:10:21] <splinter1619> only the biggest heroes run
[3:10:47] <Nyckelus> Here‚Äôs the best farming spot in the game.
[3:10:50] <Draco_Renegade> This is my favorite place to farm
[3:11:01] <crimsonsaens> Same, you need that powder
[3:11:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:11:06] <+JingKaisean> no it works, it's just not the best
[3:11:17] <Nyckelus> And you‚Äôll want to get there item drops as well.
[3:11:28] <+Mendin> Isn't this guy one of like the five ones in the game that A Certain Gimmick works on?
[3:11:28] <Nyckelus> Their*
[3:11:38] <bear_breaker20> hows that soldier and his mom doin
[3:11:38] <huskarl_zap> Oh the spear can rip off his armor
[3:11:42] <sundizzle> does woolie have the fire umbrella? if not, I have no idea how he's going to do this next part
[3:12:05] <splinter1619> toasty
[3:12:06] <T_Sasquatch> God damn
[3:12:08] <Flare3500> Base Umbrella is useless against Fire
[3:12:10] <danknugglit> You might be able to get a free healthbar on him from above
[3:12:10] <brunoberserk> MY BURNING BLADE
[3:12:10] <+AdlerDynamic> you don't need the fire umbrella, but it would help
[3:12:13] <+b_aleph> get his first orb from above
[3:12:13] <Nyckelus> @sundizzle I mean, he doesn‚Äôt need it but it‚Äôll be way tougher to block certain attacks.
[3:12:17] <convo445> burning
[3:12:23] <Kghaleon> Yeah, this guy has a gimmick that makes him a chump to kill
[3:12:26] <Flare3500> Fire Umbrella is in the upgrade tree
[3:12:29] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, i forgot you can break enemy armour with the spear
[3:12:44] <+JingKaisean> this guy can also get stealth killed
[3:12:45] <sundizzle> Nyckelus yeah I've never even tried without it
[3:12:59] <crimsonsaens> Spear is pretty niche
[3:13:08] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I like the Axe a whole lot
[3:13:09] <Nyckelus> Man, I love the Spear in this game! It has so many options.
[3:13:12] <420mangojuice> woolie this isnt bloodborne stop rolling start deflecting
[3:13:12] <Kghaleon> Spear makes the monke easy.
[3:13:14] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Axe and Firecrackers are my go to
[3:13:46] <Flare3500> At this point might as well go back to old reliable pocket sand or Firecrackers
[3:13:51] <Nyckelus> Spear and Shuriken are my most used tools.
[3:14:05] <andre11dr> I like the feathers but they aren't always the best idea
[3:14:08] <$horse_oil> yeah deflect is the most important tool in your kit for sure
[3:14:25] <$horse_oil> its really hard to play this game like a traditional soulslike most of the time
[3:14:35] <Kghaleon> Kill the small guys first
[3:14:48] <Nyckelus> Gong boy is beet boy don‚Äôt kill him!
[3:14:52] <+JingKaisean> unfortunately, spamming L1 is usually the best option
[3:15:05] <+b_aleph> get the orb from above
[3:15:06] <Nyckelus> best*
[3:15:07] <$horse_oil> you also can't go ham 100% of the time because hitstun isn't perfect, you need a rhythm
[3:15:25] <Kghaleon> Hide in the grass to lose aggro
[3:15:39] <T_Sasquatch> Game just falls apart once more than one enemy appears
[3:15:44] <andre11dr> @jingkaisean That's just Souls games in general
[3:16:00] <TonberryLives> Woolie is the best ninja guys
[3:16:06] <andre11dr> If you have the right build that is
[3:16:08] <+tigerfang86> magic katana shit, IT DONT MATTER
[3:16:17] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Nah, I find it easy to get away or deal with the situation when I'm swarmed in this game than the other games
[3:16:44] <Flare3500> Use your ears Woolie to find the sound
[3:16:47] <sundizzle> its the same enemy ringing as in the beginning of the game, they're hiding in the grass
[3:17:03] <Chester_goes_Berserk> oh he a coming
[3:17:08] <danknugglit> F
[3:17:21] <andre11dr> oh LAWD HE ,COMING
[3:17:22] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I love that the bell guy just straight up changes clothing and switches sides
[3:17:28] <+MacDatAss> too late everyone aggro'd already
[3:17:29] <LaughingCatt> Party Ledge
[3:17:32] <+tigerfang86> bell assholes have no loyalty
[3:17:34] <+tigerfang86> only bell ring
[3:17:34] <T_Sasquatch> Sekiroooo
[3:17:45] <+tigerfang86> THT WAS SICK
[3:17:49] <kenny_biff> <3 LUL
[3:17:50] <Flare3500> There goes the framerate
[3:17:52] <T_Sasquatch> THAT WAS SICK
[3:17:57] <Klefth> I never saw that shit...
[3:18:03] <brunoberserk> time for joestar secret techinque
[3:18:03] <+tigerfang86> my mans literally just rose from the flames

[3:19:21] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:19:25] <+b_aleph> they're too slim to be pat
[3:19:25] <Flare3500> Just A party going on here
[3:19:29] <%jinking79> Cloning Pat really did fuck up
[3:19:30] <T_Sasquatch> I clipped the moment
[3:19:32] <+b_aleph> and too tall!
[3:19:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah yes this spot was my grind spot
[3:19:58] <andre11dr> Use tactics
[3:20:23] <+Pinkiefan> Did he level up with memories?
[3:20:37] <Nyckelus> @pinkiefan Yeah
[3:20:41] <andre11dr> Yes
[3:21:23] <Nyckelus> Now Woolie has the farming strat.
[3:21:38] <andre11dr> Man ,i fucking hate how picking items up pauses the game EVERY TIME

[3:22:15] <+AdlerDynamic> why is woolie farming? is he working towards a specific item?
[3:22:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you wait just a bit longer you can get a stealth kill on one or both i believe
[3:22:38] <Nyckelus> @adlerdynamic Probably to unlock the last scroll.
[3:23:10] <+b_aleph> yaaay
[3:23:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[3:23:13] <T_Sasquatch> I swear this game as a few weird things that fromsoft wouldn't normally do but its clearer for players
[3:23:27] <+Mendin> Can this guy get the Spear?
[3:23:38] <+b_aleph> kill the fat man
[3:23:56] <andre11dr> Man, Pat got taller huh
[3:24:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that damage tho
[3:24:13] <+Mendin> Buff Pat from the alternate dimension where he didn't stop working out
[3:24:16] <RaidenRising> fat evil
[3:24:25] <huskarl_zap> fat politic
[3:24:27] <+b_aleph> That guy ia at least 3 pats tall
[3:24:28] <TonberryLives> This guy an indeed get the spear
[3:24:42] <samazam94> Fat Ministry
[3:25:06] <@Solidus_113> it's DS2 all over again
[3:25:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[3:25:08] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Cheese him at the house entrance
[3:25:10] <+Mendin> FromSoft putting in an overly-tracking overhead, you say
[3:25:26] <+AdlerDynamic> everyone tracks like crazy in this game because it's designed for parries versus dodges
[3:25:31] <Spoofy16> use spear to remove his armor
[3:26:04] <Chester_goes_Berserk> dodge attacks to get his health down are the basic goto for this dude
[3:26:29] <RaidenRising> you can do it woolie ! beat the fat evil
[3:26:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> oof
[3:26:33] <danknugglit> Oh no
[3:26:36] <huskarl_zap> bullshit hitbox
[3:26:38] <brunoberserk> R A N G E
[3:26:39] <NumbF4ke> Almost
[3:26:41] <Flare3500> You can still block him if his sword is not on fire
[3:26:43] <+0BM0Z> you can parry everytthing except the grab
[3:26:44] <@Solidus_113> not on fire
[3:26:45] <sundizzle> you can parry anything that you can't parry
[3:26:45] <%jinking79> thay just painful
[3:26:49] <andre11dr> Murakumo to op
[3:26:52] <Nyckelus> You can.
[3:26:57] <Indigo_Automaton> You can parry, also he is weak to the spear prosthetic
[3:27:09] <Nyckelus> If you block it though you get a little fire chip damage.
[3:27:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> remember, Pat hates needles Woolie
[3:27:18] <sundizzle> you get fire chip damage when its on fire, but also you can parry just like everything else in the game
[3:27:51] <huskarl_zap> Tags: Mind break
[3:28:20] <+AdlerDynamic> specifically the thrust type spear prosthetic
[3:28:25] <Flare3500> There you go Woolie remembered to use L1
[3:28:40] <Klefth> Man, Jusou the Reused is tough
[3:28:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> woolie please parry instead of jumping lol
[3:29:03] <sundizzle> gourd doesn't heal burn, only reduces buildup
[3:29:18] <%sporeian94> Firecrackers
[3:29:26] <sundizzle> dousing powder heals
[3:29:32] <huskarl_zap> no selling that true death sword
[3:29:38] <huskarl_zap> chad
[3:29:48] <+yukichocomilk> i like side stepping the vertical ones
[3:29:52] <andre11dr> Looking at this dudes sword, im getting unpatched Farron Curved Great Sword PTSD
[3:30:05] <Flare3500> It's kinda funny that Woolie will do anything except parry as the last resort
[3:30:19] <+AdlerDynamic> man jumps like the floor is lava
[3:30:30] <Ecliptic_Origins> ouch
[3:30:32] <iwa5h4ck3d> ! BURN !
[3:30:34] <NumbF4ke> Dang
[3:30:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> close
[3:30:47] <brunoberserk> cof cof
[3:30:51] <TonberryLives> You can only jump perilous sweeps
[3:31:03] <Flare3500> I only jump when there is a red sign that's it everything else is parry
[3:31:06] <Kghaleon> You can also beat this guy off camera, I don't think anyone really cares about seeing the mini bosses.
[3:31:13] <sundizzle> jumping is only for the unblockables, you can't rely on them
[3:31:29] <speximillian> Cowards live
[3:31:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> c l e a n
[3:31:32] <Indigo_Automaton> Spear strips his armor
[3:31:33] <NDenizen> jumping back and deflecting in mid-air is a good thing
[3:31:40] <Nyckelus> It‚Äôs aight Woolie. Jumps do have a little bit of i-frames but it‚Äôs way less reliable than other methods.
[3:31:44] <NDenizen> regular jumping is meh
[3:31:57] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Cheese at door
[3:32:26] <Ecliptic_Origins> backbreaker
[3:32:26] <CoffeeSlice> oof
[3:32:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:32:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ouch
[3:32:38] <sundizzle> woolie stop using firebombs
[3:32:39] <amritadyne> damn backseating gets taken to the extreme with these games huh
[3:32:42] <amritadyne> let him learn
[3:32:44] <andre11dr> There was a game where jumping has mega I-frames, im trying to remember
[3:32:50] <CoffeeSlice> YO
[3:32:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @amritadyne lol yea
[3:33:26] <+yukichocomilk> yeah man just let him fight, he'll beat it on his own time
[3:33:31] <velgaduere> @amritadyne no play, ONLY BEAT benbriLUCY
[3:33:35] <+tigerfang86> NO TIME FOR FIRE
[3:33:38] <MikeSmashLeo> That was badass
[3:33:38] <+tigerfang86> ONLY DEATH
[3:33:51] <Nyckelus> I-frame through the fire!
[3:33:51] <brunoberserk> through the fire and the flames

[3:37:34] <NumbF4ke> Nice job!
[3:37:38] <Nyckelus> @theotherkristian It‚Äôs fine. He‚Äôll learn via brute force if necessary.
[3:37:39] <%SilverDevilfish> A gift of tears
[3:37:42] <velgaduere> gg
[3:37:43] <laguerrilha> An in those tears there would be salt
[3:37:46] <andre11dr> GG EZ
[3:37:47] <Nyckelus> Nicely done!
[3:37:47] <speximillian> "We trained his wrong, as a prank."
[3:37:51] <Indigo_Automaton> Nice
[3:37:55] <%jinking79> FatEvil defeated
[3:37:59] <Flare3500> LOL we're still learning were at the end of the game
[3:38:06] <+Grayhammatter> gracious gift of tears
[3:38:19] <+0BM0Z> you guys aren't even thinking about the demon of hatred
[3:38:25] <Nyckelus> @flare3500 I mean, he‚Äôs gonna have to learn a lot on these next two fights.
[3:38:28] <+0BM0Z> if this guy took this long just imagine doh
[3:38:32] <amritadyne> @Flare3500 if you want to play the game go play it with a controller rather than woolie's twitch chat
[3:38:43] <+tigerfang86> chat really really lame again lets goooo
[3:38:44] <thefranchise00> The DOH just breaks every rule thats been established
[3:38:57] <+0BM0Z> gotta play doh like its bloodborne
[3:39:20] <+AdlerDynamic> yeah DOH isn't something the game prepares you for very well tbh
[3:39:32] <Flare3500> @amritadyne LOL I'm jsut describing his playstyle I'm not even suggesting what he should do
[3:39:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:39:35] <Kghaleon> Cool, my new computer arrived. Feel bad that I forgot about Woolie's sponsor.
[3:39:36] <andre11dr> DoH feels like a rejected Bloodborne boss
[3:39:41] <sundizzle> woolie you should probably check out the dilapitated temple too
[3:39:46] <convo445> you could rewatch Pat's stream for better gameplay
[3:39:49] <NDenizen> delicious centipede eggs
[3:39:50] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Hot take: DOH is worse than Bed of Chaos. It's awful
[3:39:50] <%sporeian94> "Rice"
[3:39:54] <OblivionSword1> delicious delicious rice
[3:40:00] <Ecliptic_Origins> mmmm
[3:40:02] <thefranchise00> It's cool story boss tho
[3:40:03] <Ecliptic_Origins> tasty rice
[3:40:04] <Nyckelus> Yeah, go and upgrade some prosthetics!
[3:40:21] <Who_lio42> i would eat that rice for her
[3:40:24] <brunoberserk> woolieMINHMAX
[3:40:25] <TonberryLives> @Chester_goes_Berserk That's a spicy take
[3:40:28] <andre11dr> @chester_goes_berserk NO WAY, BoC is actually unfinished
[3:40:34] <Kghaleon> ooohhhhh
[3:40:43] <T_Sasquatch> @chester_goes_berserk doh ?
[3:40:46] <+yukichocomilk> he gotta fight the demon
[3:40:48] <Flare3500> Oh Oh spaghettis oh do it yourself
[3:40:50] <OblivionSword1> gotta do it yourself
[3:40:51] <thefranchise00> BoC didn't take me 5 hours personally
[3:40:53] <Nyckelus> @chester_goes_berserk That is a hot take.
[3:40:57] <velgaduere> @Flare3500 you should still be learning at the end of every game, otherwise the game is too easy
[3:40:57] <T_Sasquatch> Ohhhh doh

[3:41:04] <brunoberserk> sculptor : DO IT YOURSELF, FUCKER
[3:41:06] <thefranchise00> I was so OP at that point it took much less time
[3:41:07] <laguerrilha> You are japanese, you leave the money on the table

[3:41:12] <andre11dr> PAY YOURSELF
[3:41:15] <Ecliptic_Origins> invest in yourself Yakuza 0 style
[3:41:17] <Flare3500> pay for the tools to use
[3:41:17] <+penjaza> FIRE UMBRELLA
[3:41:20] <+MacDatAss> SELF CHECKOUT
[3:41:21] <Nyckelus> EAT the money!
[3:41:23] <sundizzle> FIRE UMBRELLA
[3:41:27] <Flare3500> there's also fire umbrella which is sweet
[3:41:27] <thefranchise00> yo the lazulite shuriken tho
[3:41:32] <stormhawk9891> FIRE UMBRELLA PLEASE
[3:41:33] <brunoberserk> fire umbrella
[3:41:36] <primaryfire> fire umbrella fucks
[3:41:48] <sundizzle> you can't get all the final ones in NG
[3:41:53] <Nyckelus> Highly recommend the fire umbrella.
[3:41:54] <thefranchise00> oh yeah you legit NEED the fire umbrella for DoH
[3:42:06] <Pandora_Prime> Shuriken for sure
[3:42:07] <+penjaza> Good
[3:42:14] <andre11dr> I like the final flame upgrade, it looks cool
[3:42:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is it only 4 per playthrough? thought it was more
[3:42:21] <Nyckelus> @thefranchise00 Nah, I beat that without it. Just gotta time your dodges well.
[3:42:25] <TonberryLives> I believe you can get 12 lapis in one playthrough
[3:42:28] <NumbF4ke> Were the lazulite upgrades any good? Never upgraded to them myself.
[3:42:29] <Indigo_Automaton> Sacred Flame is the most useful for killing Headless
[3:42:30] <+MacDatAss> you only get 6 lapis per playthrough and you need 10 total
[3:42:30] <sundizzle> cobalt_phoenix_ nope, there's just not enough
[3:42:32] <danknugglit> Shuriken is great
[3:42:36] <primaryfire> they all have their uses
[3:42:40] <NDenizen> Shuriken
[3:42:47] <%Irridium> Axe is GOAT
[3:42:50] <Pandora_Prime> Shuriken best
[3:42:51] <%Irridium> also Shuriken
[3:42:55] <sundizzle> the axe has a special ability to dispel illusions, good against certain enemies @WoolieVersus
[3:42:55] <danknugglit> Its a gun
[3:42:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @sundizzle oh I know, but I thought there was more to get in a run still
[3:42:59] <Nyckelus> Shuriken is legitimately one of the most useful tools.
[3:43:01] <Flare3500> Coin toss if you're rich
[3:43:28] <DatAsuna> I used the butterfly ones just cause aesthetic
[3:43:31] <Ecliptic_Origins> thats hella important
[3:43:34] <Pandora_Prime> Shuriken is a ranged chainsaw
[3:43:37] <Indigo_Automaton> 1
[3:43:38] <primaryfire> spoken to the merchant?
[3:43:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it should say no?
[3:43:54] <andre11dr> He dose have the Lady Butterfly nails so there is that
[3:43:54] <thefranchise00> @Nyckelus props to you, I could never get my movement down to dodge the long arm slams
[3:43:54] <+b_aleph> under my flame umbrella ella ella eh eh eh under my flame umbrellaaa
[3:44:00] <+MacDatAss> all and shuriken/shields take 1
[3:44:01] <NDenizen> This umbrella is incredible
[3:44:02] <Ecliptic_Origins> ella ella ella
[3:44:02] <NDenizen> use it
[3:44:04] <+bunchaghosts> cool.
[3:44:11] <thefranchise00> the umbrella hard tanks shit
[3:44:22] <Nyckelus> Love that followup even though I never use it.
[3:44:39] <+bunchaghosts> do ending final at the end
[3:44:48] <TonberryLives> Last ingredient COME ON
[3:44:48] <convo445> you can at least look and then die
[3:44:49] <armchairmaster_> Final bosses tho
[3:44:50] <Flare3500> How long did the fat guy take ?
[3:44:53] <samazam94> call it a day?
[3:44:56] <VidulaSaix> Maybe not enough in a session today to finish it
[3:45:02] <brunoberserk> but flame demon monke tho
[3:45:02] <VidulaSaix> 1 more session and you can finish it all off
[3:45:04] <sundizzle> one of them is a whole area
[3:45:05] <Nyckelus> Try out the secret boss?
[3:45:07] <convo445> it won't take long to look#
[3:45:11] <andre11dr> Well he should do THAT boss, the fire one
[3:45:17] <+b_aleph> @VidulaSaix that's a wild assumption
[3:45:19] <Ecliptic_Origins> its one fight
[3:45:19] <+DragonArt07> secret boss
[3:45:20] <primaryfire> oh yeah it's hard
[3:45:20] <XeroSigmaPrime> I dont think theres enough time to beat
[3:45:21] <laguerrilha> last ingredient and finishing secret+ last boss next stream sounds better
[3:45:25] <DatAsuna> for 2 of the endings iirc
[3:45:26] <TonberryLives> OH YEAH
[3:45:27] <sundizzle> you still need to get to the final boss
[3:45:28] <primaryfire> all 3 options are hard bosses
[3:45:29] <+b_aleph> A minute and a week
[3:45:34] <Ecliptic_Origins> superboss is insane tbh
[3:45:34] <+yukichocomilk> secret boss!
[3:45:38] <%Jiggisnipe> go look at the optional boss. give it one shot and call it for the day
[3:45:41] <convo445> all bosses are too hard
[3:45:58] <Kghaleon> No no no, you can get all the endings at once. You can save after killing the final boss before the ending
[3:45:59] <samazam94> i say call it a day, all the bosses are no joke
[3:45:59] <+MacDatAss> you can only do one ending
[3:46:00] <Indigo_Automaton> No
[3:46:04] <+b_aleph> thrice
[3:46:09] <andre11dr> He should just go do DoH now
[3:46:10] <%AyotoCorp> You can save right after the final boss and reload to get a different ending
[3:46:11] <brunoberserk> the important is fighting all the bosses , fuck the endings
[3:46:17] <%nintenbren> You can back up your save right before choosing endings
[3:46:20] <Kghaleon> You can save backup before the choice
[3:46:22] <%jinking79> like Pat did Save Scum it
[3:46:22] <velgaduere> @brunoberserk correct take
[3:46:28] <Kghaleon> Wrong Minh
[3:46:30] <TonberryLives> You literally have to walk to a prompt
[3:46:30] <+penjaza> You can save before choice as long as you're careful
[3:46:31] <danknugglit> Upload save to cloud
[3:46:31] <+b_aleph> you already made the choice
[3:46:32] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus Minh is wrong, you can save after the final boss
[3:46:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:46:38] <brunoberserk> @velgaduere thanks
[3:46:43] <%nintenbren> you dont have to fight him three times
[3:46:44] <NDenizen> Minh is wrong, your save you have uploaded now is the correct one
[3:46:50] <Flare3500> That fat guy really took a lot on Woolie
[3:46:50] <primaryfire> lmao
[3:46:52] <+yukichocomilk> there's a secret boss too
[3:46:53] <DatAsuna> backup anyways
[3:46:57] <sundizzle> there is an option after the boss, but you can't go back to the other bosses
[3:46:59] <armchairmaster_> Don't risk it, fight the optional bosses when you come back @woolieversus
[3:47:00] <VidulaSaix> Just back up anyway
[3:47:03] <XeroSigmaPrime> Youre already locked out
[3:47:08] <DatAsuna> better safe than sorry
[3:47:14] <Kghaleon> Yes Woolie
[3:47:18] <andre11dr> It's already to late
[3:47:18] <+b_aleph> YOU DIDNT EAT ENOUGH RICE!!!
[3:47:20] <Draco_Renegade> I did that
[3:47:22] <velgaduere> that was kinda poorly explained, but yeah
[3:47:22] <+0BM0Z> why dont you just beat him three times lol
[3:47:23] <vVAstrAVv> that sounds like one guy to me
[3:47:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[3:47:30] <realfiction> This is so confusing
[3:47:30] <brunoberserk> god , fuck this game bullshit , is so obtuse
[3:47:31] <primaryfire> love this
[3:47:31] <wqorst> NotLikeThis
[3:47:32] <Spoofy16> get the ingredients first
[3:47:34] <Ecliptic_Origins> but you need the ingredient first
[3:47:38] <NDenizen> it's really not that confusing
[3:47:39] <+Carquar> One. Guy.
[3:47:44] <NDenizen> people just find a way to make it confusing
[3:47:46] <Kghaleon> Minh is that one guy
[3:47:46] <CoffeeSlice> NotLikeThis
[3:47:54] <+Carquar> Is Minh the one guy?
[3:47:54] <Flare3500> Just youtube the other endings
[3:47:57] <convo445> we just want to see the boss and say goodnight
[3:48:01] <samazam94> @woolieversus do you even care about the muktiple endingsbif they all have the same boss fight?
[3:48:05] <+robosqueeb> Oh my god
[3:48:10] <%ChoculaUltra> its like watching 2 people who've been on a roadtrip for far too long
[3:48:14] <vVAstrAVv> im glad i never have to play this game again
[3:48:16] <VidulaSaix> This obtuse shit LUL
[3:48:20] <NDenizen> No you wouldnt good lord
[3:48:21] <%Jiggisnipe> you guys are agreeing btw
[3:48:25] <NDenizen> DONT CHANGE YOUR SAVE
[3:48:29] <%Jiggisnipe> thank you LUL
[3:48:32] <convo445> i wouldn't want these dudes as my advisors
[3:48:33] <andre11dr> Minh is definitely making this way more complicated than it actually is LUL
[3:48:35] <Kghaleon> It's not obtuse, it's straight up not how you're supposed to do it. It's just convenient.
[3:48:35] <primaryfire> load the save LUL
[3:48:37] <%ChoculaUltra> you guys are aggressively agreeing
[3:48:42] <%RyTYoung> Just found a dark mode setting on my phone and now my notifications and keyboard are a darker tone, why have I been torturing myself for this long
[3:48:44] <convo445> it makes any game worse if you ask me
[3:48:48] <velgaduere> [AGGRESSIVE AGREEMENT]
[3:48:48] <OblivionSword1> which optional boss minh ?
[3:48:51] <sundizzle> just saying, you didn't eat enough rice so one ending is locked out
[3:48:52] <convo445> being a streamer
[3:48:52] <laguerrilha> Minh probably researched this before this sessions so lets trust him
[3:48:55] <+MrMegaJackpots> were they just arguing the same point?
[3:48:59] <%jinking79> Enma give u the Item
[3:49:00] <RaidenRising> samurai jack
[3:49:01] <NDenizen> The save uploaded before the Dragon is the one you need for the secret boss
[3:49:04] <%AyotoCorp> Audience chamber
[3:49:04] <TonberryLives> Do you have Owl's bell? Cuz that's shit's locked out now
[3:49:05] <danknugglit> The one in the horse arena?
[3:49:07] <+penjaza> Needed to do extra stuff to get access to new Memory bell
[3:49:09] <Flare3500> Oh God I forgot we haven't fought past dad
[3:49:09] <sundizzle> you need the bell
[3:49:11] <@Menitta> lmao why is Fromsoft like this
[3:49:15] <Indigo_Automaton> Audience Chamber
[3:49:17] <+MacDatAss> you can do the past anymore its locked
[3:49:24] <Deasmeister> didn't get bell before dragon
[3:49:26] <+GingerStrawhat> Did you get the bell?
[3:49:29] <Spoofy16> you have to beat red demon first
[3:49:32] <+legendofthom> you need to reenter through de buddha idol with owls bell
[3:49:36] <+GingerStrawhat> After you beat Owl?
[3:49:43] <@Solidus_113> GOTY 2019 everyone
[3:49:46] <%sirisvirus> you do not have to beat the demon
[3:49:48] <convo445> @Menitta it doesn't take a phd, some people know to look everywhere before hand, but content creators can not afford the time
[3:49:48] <TonberryLives> Yep they don't have it
[3:49:54] <andre11dr> Yeah, it's not unlocked
[3:49:56] <DatAsuna> so is he going for the flower or the viscera?
[3:49:59] <TonberryLives> Locked out
[3:50:01] <DatAsuna> I've been distracted
[3:50:03] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[3:50:05] <VidulaSaix> GOTY BTW LUL
[3:50:05] <Flare3500> I mean it is GOTY material
[3:50:09] <+GingerStrawhat> Like it should have been on Owls body I think
[3:50:13] <sundizzle> did you get the bell from emma at the grave?
[3:50:15] <%Lion_kun> Good thing Woolie saved before.
[3:50:15] <primaryfire> locked out as of the divine dragon, but there is still another boss
[3:50:16] <%SainEdge> the stuff for the optional boss in the past has to be obtained before the dragon fight
[3:50:19] <+robosqueeb> This isn't a problem when you're playing it on you're own, but when trying to create content or stream god damn does this fall to pieces
[3:50:22] <Flare3500> lul 5 million sales more than Nioh 1 and 2 combined
[3:50:28] <andre11dr> They said they spayed on Emma, remember LUL
[3:50:33] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:50:38] <samazam94> lol
[3:50:39] <Nyckelus> Yes, that is why we made that save.
[3:50:39] <andre11dr> I GUESS THEY FUCKING DON'T
[3:50:41] <+penjaza> Check for bell in key items
[3:50:43] <laguerrilha> Kind of his fromsoft allowed 3 save files so people dont cheese yet can save in this cases
[3:50:47] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah you have to talk to emma to get the bell of Owl
[3:50:49] <redrins> was chat right? LUL
[3:50:50] <laguerrilha> wish*
[3:50:51] <+penjaza> Need 2 bells
[3:50:52] <sundizzle> @WoolieVersus also, you need to eat more rice to unlock the other ending
[3:50:53] <convo445> guess who knew better than one head
[3:50:57] <TheQuadrupleS> LUL
[3:50:57] <OblivionSword1> Boy get hype for Elden Ring guys Kappa
[3:51:01] <sundizzle> its from the grave near the bottom of ashina castle
[3:51:02] <+GingerStrawhat> Gotta talk to Emma
[3:51:04] <Indigo_Automaton> You guys didn't do the eavesdropping?
[3:51:07] <+GingerStrawhat> after killing Owl
[3:51:08] <TonberryLives> Before shit's on fire
[3:51:08] <Kghaleon> Didn't he miss the other Owl fight?
[3:51:10] <Canadian_Suit> can't believe Minh honestly, get a laptop dude
[3:51:11] <%jinking79> before the Dragon fight
[3:51:12] <%SainEdge> before the dragon
[3:51:12] <andre11dr> This is tototally Minhs fault
[3:51:14] <laguerrilha> Better to wiki than to get from us
[3:51:14] <danknugglit> Gamedesign is convoluted in lordran
[3:51:15] <convo445> more like you thought you were right
[3:51:17] <TonberryLives> NOPE
[3:51:18] <VidulaSaix> catJam
[3:51:22] <sundizzle> I think you can check, but she might not be there
[3:51:29] <Canadian_Suit> GET A LAPTOP
[3:51:38] <+MacDatAss> you can get the owl bell after the first owl fight
[3:51:39] <+penjaza> You can unlock it but I don't think she'll be there
[3:51:43] <+GingerStrawhat> I don't think she can go there anymore
[3:51:44] <+Sovspot> Im surprised woolie is playing this game again when it seemed like he wasn't too impressed by it when it was released.
[3:51:50] <%jinking79> it mite be to late now
[3:51:51] <+GingerStrawhat> Cause the castle is under seige
[3:51:57] <thefranchise00> I don't think she's there because the attack has started
[3:51:58] <sundizzle> it's convoluted, I don't blame you guys LUL
[3:51:58] <NDenizen> Cant blame Fromsoft for this tbh
[3:51:59] <samazam94> playthrough ruined yay!

[3:52:15] <andre11dr> Just fight DoH and suffer LUL
[3:52:15] <+Pinkiefan> You have to eavesdrop on the kid, then talk to Emma, then go to the graveyard. I believe it all has to be done before killing the dragon.
[3:52:16] <Kghaleon> Just youtube it
[3:52:21] <primaryfire> that's why people were saying the dragon would lock you out, man
[3:52:30] <laguerrilha> @Sovspot after playing Nioh it makes sense he would be up to try this again
[3:52:33] <+0BM0Z> its nowhere near this complicated
[3:52:36] <convo445> it would be less convoluted if they were at the right time
[3:52:48] <+legendofthom> earsdrop emma and kubo, talk with emma , talk with emma at the grave, earsdrop emma and sculptor, talk to emma. she gives you than a bell
[3:52:51] <convo445> you were too late
[3:52:53] <OblivionSword1> too late i guess
[3:52:53] <+0BM0Z> you missed it
[3:52:54] <sundizzle> yeah emma's not here, have to do it before dragon
[3:52:56] <%AyotoCorp> You missed it
[3:53:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Emma should be there right?
[3:53:01] <Deasmeister> before dragon
[3:53:05] <%jinking79> have to do it before the Dragon
[3:53:08] <Kghaleon> Just fuck it, youtube it.
[3:53:08] <%RyTYoung> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:53:09] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Hahahaha
[3:53:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[3:53:10] <+MacDatAss> youre locked out of that ending
[3:53:10] <NDenizen> That's why you check before the dragon
[3:53:12] <Indigo_Automaton> Locked out
[3:53:12] <velgaduere> lmfao
[3:53:13] <+0BM0Z> woolies eyes lul
[3:53:13] <Ecliptic_Origins> key was that you needed to do this before dragon
[3:53:14] <NDenizen> which is what everyone was saying
[3:53:15] <+penjaza> @legendofthom is right
[3:53:18] <velgaduere> LAWD
[3:53:20] <primaryfire> it's not just eavesdropping, there's more to it
[3:53:21] <convo445> but that is your responsiblity to remember
[3:53:25] <+b_aleph> who cares, just keep playing
[3:53:25] <%RyTYoung> KEEP IT IN LUL
[3:53:30] <samazam94> i dont think this one is on FS. its a combination of leaving the game for too long and misremembering things and not enough research
[3:53:32] <sundizzle> you have to get emma to give you the bell, but now she's stuck here
[3:53:35] <thefranchise00> 4Head

[3:53:41] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Sekiro>Nion 2
[3:53:48] <laguerrilha> Its ok, perfect ending and regular are good enough
[3:53:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> eavesdrop dead people
[3:53:52] <@Solidus_113> you can't do anything different now, the dragon locks you in completely
[3:53:54] <sundizzle> @WoolieVersus also, you need to eat more rice for the 3rd ending
[3:53:56] <samazam94> dont blame FS on this one
[3:53:56] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:53:59] <+b_aleph> yaaaay
[3:54:00] <+Pinkiefan> Too late to do it now. Gotta reload the save if you want the secret boss.
[3:54:00] <Kghaleon> Youtube the endings and forget about all that
[3:54:01] <%wibbwobbler> fight dragon?
[3:54:02] <%RyTYoung> Just show us a path chart in game showing what ending path we are on and what we have missed please FROM SOFT
[3:54:04] <TonberryLives> Shit's locked. Emma is involved and so is the sculptor. They're locked in place now.
[3:54:06] <Canadian_Suit> JUST TALK TO EMMA @WoolieVersus
[3:54:09] <+b_aleph> GOOD FOR YOU!!!
[3:54:11] <%Irridium> gotta love FromSoftware games
[3:54:14] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:54:16] <Indigo_Automaton> There's still one optional boss
[3:54:18] <sundizzle> you can still do the other fights
[3:54:19] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> LUL
[3:54:20] <convo445> when were you under the impression than Minh was under the impression that he was right
[3:54:20] <velgaduere> the story isn't even good enough to justify these ending shenanigans lobosKek
[3:54:21] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Good
[3:54:21] <+penjaza> @Canadian_Suit It's too late
[3:54:24] <stormhawk9891> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:54:25] <vnzuelandude> Yeah just play, doesnt matter
[3:54:26] <+legendofthom> just look in your main items if you have the bell from owl
[3:54:26] <Spoofy16> do owl fight
[3:54:27] <Bl4kDynamite> You shouldn't have beaten the divine dragon
[3:54:28] <DatAsuna> Yeah I remember the divine child stuff in this game was the last dtraw for me with miyazaki style quest scripting
[3:54:31] <redrins> chat warned you guys, yall didnt listen. when streamers become one guy
[3:54:31] <sundizzle> you can still do the other fights, just won't get the best ending
[3:54:33] <Nyckelus> Just get the other 2 endings it‚Äôs fine. Don‚Äôt forget the other boss though.
[3:54:33] <convo445> just take a look
[3:54:40] <%SainEdge> thats why you made the save before the dragon, i dont know why you are so confused LUL
[3:54:43] <+Pinkiefan> There‚Äôs also the other side-boss.
[3:54:45] <NDenizen> rofl
[3:54:47] <Canadian_Suit> @penjaza AHHH kuro isn't there to have the convo
[3:54:50] <samazam94> yeah this one is on you guys
[3:54:51] <+AdlerDynamic> just do the regular ending and then go back later if you feel so inclined

[3:55:31] <convo445> personally i am done with the adive from minh and chat
[3:55:35] <laguerrilha> Woolie did give a honest shoot to the game. this Criptic ending stuff is the worst part of Fromsoft games
[3:55:45] <NDenizen> It's not cryptic ending shit
[3:55:47] <Indigo_Automaton> Why skip the DoH? It's not attached to the locked out ending
[3:55:47] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:55:50] <TonberryLives> what
[3:55:57] <convo445> @laguerrilha Minh got it wrong though, his guide sucks

[3:57:56] <sundizzle> woolie can still do the DoH fight, it's not required for any ending
[3:57:56] <convo445> are you sure it's the game and not just who you choose to believe
[3:57:59] <VidulaSaix> No shot this game has a 3rd session LUL
[3:58:03] <Nyckelus> Honestly, this is great. Look at the fire and say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù
[3:58:08] <TonberryLives> It is totally your fault tho
[3:58:08] <velgaduere> ????????????
[3:58:11] <%Jiggisnipe> LUL

[3:58:17] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus at least get the bonfire for the final boss
[3:58:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[3:58:19] <TonberryLives> LUL
[3:58:20] <NumbF4ke> LUL
[3:58:22] <laguerrilha> But it is Fromsoft fault for making the endings so criptic and easy to miss
[3:58:22] <samazam94> exactly
[3:58:23] <convo445> Pat did it himself and yet here it's too many cooks
[3:58:25] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:58:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BASED MINH
[3:58:29] <Zayasu> LUL
[3:58:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That would be RUDE
[3:58:31] <Kghaleon> lol nice Mihn
[3:58:32] <primaryfire> LUL
[3:58:34] <Indigo_Automaton> Just in case there was confusion, there were two optional bosses before the final boss. One is locked out, the Superboss is not and is a rad fight
[3:58:37] <NDenizen> No TV and No Beer make Minh something something
[3:58:41] <+robosqueeb> FINAL
[3:58:42] <+Dorf1> that rules mihn is so fucking based

[3:58:51] <Nyckelus> Keep it going! Rock the boat!
[3:58:51] <convo445> @laguerrilha why did Pat have an easier time? because minh fucked more than neccesary
[3:59:23] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus LEFT
[3:59:25] <NDenizen> Pat managed this alone despite his Stand ability
[3:59:26] <laguerrilha> @convo445 because he and the mods read guides or just beat the game after reading one
[3:59:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> NO it's just two fucks
[3:59:28] <+MacDatAss> its back where you got your arm cut off
[3:59:32] <andre11dr> Man,this is making me appreciate Pat a lot more, holy shit you guys, it's not THIS HARD

[4:00:09] <%Jiggisnipe> who cares
[4:00:09] <Indigo_Automaton> It's SICK
[4:00:11] <Kghaleon> You already skipped the secret bosses
[4:00:12] <sundizzle> you don't have time for the final boss
[4:00:12] <%jinking79> cause Pat spoil himself in FromSoftware games

[4:01:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> minh, just get a guide lol
[4:01:25] <andre11dr> And i was on MINH TEAM in Dokapon
[4:01:25] <Ecliptic_Origins> the endings in this game are obtsue as hell
[4:01:26] <%RyTYoung> Every game is gonna be hard to pick back up to try and finish off, ESPECIALLY SEKIRO
[4:01:30] <convo445> @jinking79 yeah they do if you don't zoom at the speed of content
[4:01:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im skimming the wiki right now and still can't remember half of this

[4:01:55] <Ecliptic_Origins> the endings here are dumb as hell
[4:01:58] <NumbF4ke> Shit happens
[4:01:58] <VidulaSaix> If it was just story fine whatever but its cool bosses
[4:02:00] <Ecliptic_Origins> (has gotten them)
[4:02:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> All the resources are online if you needed them, it's not on FromSoft
[4:02:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @zanzibar_junker no shit its an optional ending, you can just finish the game normally
[4:02:09] <convo445> i like them to balance the dumbassery
[4:02:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> this is extra content
[4:02:11] <samazam94> its not even that obtuse
[4:02:15] <Kghaleon> You could just youtube the endings, who cares.
[4:02:18] <sundizzle> the fextra life page is enough to help minh guide the hips
[4:02:19] <DatAsuna> it is hella jank tho
[4:02:19] <%kullumanati> John‚Äôs incoming
[4:02:21] <VidulaSaix> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Ah yes just spoil yourself Makes sense
[4:02:24] <vVAstrAVv> the most obtuse nioh ever gets is letting you bow to the mimics lol
[4:02:29] <%jinking79> @convo445 yeah tell that to everyone else
[4:02:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus just make Minh have the guide since he's already spoiled
[4:02:30] <convo445> some people can do this but not you
[4:02:31] <wqorst> i like it :)
[4:02:31] <Spoofy16> guides are spoiler free
[4:02:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Have you stopped buying the games?
[4:02:35] <Jashter18> @canadiananimatorguy FromSoft shouldn't make it this obtuse my guy
[4:02:35] <DatAsuna> Like "talk to npc, teleport away and back 5 times"
[4:02:38] <%SainEdge> i mean two endings are super easy to get, one is a bit tricky and one is convoluted. Its not that bad
[4:02:40] <Ecliptic_Origins> if you need to google how to get the endings, then there's a problem with how to get em
[4:02:46] <convo445> why is there a feeling of hurry
[4:02:48] <+DaBigVitus> haven't been watching this LP but got the feeling woolie hasn't been enjoying it? is that accurate?
[4:02:50] <@Menitta> idk, I'm not a fan of obtuse stuff that relies on online communities/other people figuring it out
[4:02:55] <TonberryLives> Ah yes, the salt
[4:02:55] <andre11dr> Fuck the endings, do the optional boss that you're just ignoring
[4:03:02] <%jinking79> just NG+ It ppl always tell others
[4:03:02] <danknugglit> Its fine
[4:03:05] <convo445> @Menitta that's litteraly souls games
[4:03:08] <vVAstrAVv> sucks that sekiros such a PoS game when its world is awesome
[4:03:08] <Canadian_Suit> you can't really miss the eavesdrop unless you rush @WoolieVersus , i blame minh for not doing any prep at all
[4:03:11] <Jashter18> @convo445 The covid is starting to wake up so they gotta jet
[4:03:14] <vnzuelandude> this is nothing new Woolie, you're just not meant to know how to do everything on your first run
[4:03:18] <samazam94> this is arguebly the least obtuse of all the FS games
[4:03:22] <%Zanzibar_Junker> It is obtuse
[4:03:22] <primaryfire> I agree but it has been exacerbated here
[4:03:26] <@Menitta> tis my point
[4:03:30] <dizimous> I agree that the obtuse shit is dumb, but it's really not covering that much content ay least
[4:03:46] <dizimous> @samazam94 Agreed
[4:03:48] <%wibbwobbler> it's definitely not straight forward lol
[4:03:49] <%Zanzibar_Junker> The ending
[4:03:50] <%kullumanati> Here‚Äôs what obtuse means? annoyingly insensitive or slow to understand. ‚Äúhe wondered if the doctor was being deliberately obtuse‚Äù
[4:03:54] <convo445> more stupid people had a better time getting the endings blind than this situation
[4:03:58] <+JingKaisean> did they realize that they didn't do the extra endings?
[4:04:02] <+MacDatAss> just get it in new game+
[4:04:11] <sundizzle> @WoolieVersus minh, you need to do the rice for kuro part too for the return ending
[4:04:11] <%Zanzibar_Junker> Requirements
[4:04:14] <@Menitta> no, obtuse means greater than 90 degrees Kappa
[4:04:26] <andre11dr> I'm not mad about his opinions, im mad because when we asked "did you do the Emma thing?" THE JUST SAID YES LUL
[4:04:27] <Ecliptic_Origins> obtuse angles Kappa
[4:04:31] <danknugglit> Youre acute chat :)
[4:04:32] <vVAstrAVv> just get the bad end woolie its fiiine lol
[4:04:39] <Indigo_Automaton> That's totally fair
[4:04:44] <vVAstrAVv> you saw fountainhead good enough
[4:04:53] <Canadian_Suit> what a shit show :D
[4:04:53] <+JingKaisean> lol oh man
[4:04:54] <convo445> so you thought
[4:04:54] <%Jiggisnipe> hell no
[4:04:57] <samazam94> lol
[4:04:57] <+JingKaisean> there's a lot of shit ya'll didn't do
[4:05:04] <T_Sasquatch> BRING OUT THE WIKIIIII
[4:05:06] <OblivionSword1> it was 2 years ago
[4:05:10] <T_Sasquatch> W i k i t i m e
[4:05:11] <%Zanzibar_Junker> The extra ending is also creepy
[4:05:12] <TonberryLives> This makes me appreciate Peeve's attitudes on this
[4:05:13] <+JingKaisean> bloodborne
[4:05:15] <Indigo_Automaton> It's unfortunate that From is as insistent on obtuse quest design as they are
[4:05:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> MANY GAMES DO THAT
[4:05:17] <@Solidus_113> Rewatching the LP probably wouldn't have helped, it's only highlights
[4:05:17] <Ecliptic_Origins> bloodborne to a degree
[4:05:19] <convo445> Woolie you have been guided all this time
[4:05:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bloodborne but not as much
[4:05:20] <NumbF4ke> Ds3
[4:05:22] <dizimous> All the from soft games lol
[4:05:22] <+JingKaisean> ds3
[4:05:29] <Ecliptic_Origins> with the umbillical cords, and one line that even hints at it
[4:05:30] <samazam94> holy shit i cant stop laughing
[4:05:31] <+robosqueeb> Don't beat yourself up Minh, you're really trying your best, same goes for you Woolz
[4:05:33] <VidulaSaix> Umbilical Cords just reward exploration though. Very easy all things considered
[4:05:34] <dizimous> ds1 and 3 so it super hard
[4:05:34] <NumbF4ke> With the darksign
[4:05:34] <Johannen> Obsidian Games all do that
[4:05:38] <convo445> some people were not guided like all the other games LPs you did
[4:05:39] <andre11dr> Bloodborne is the only other one
[4:05:40] <Johannen> All RPGs do that
[4:05:41] <+JingKaisean> persona 5 sorta
[4:05:43] <samazam94> this is so absurd
[4:05:44] <%kullumanati> I think you should do a different game. You don‚Äôt really seem to enjoy this game at all. It‚Äôs very obvious.
[4:05:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> getting secret endings are supposed to be secret
[4:05:49] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Code Vien
[4:05:57] <%kullumanati> Mental gymnastics podcast
[4:05:57] <DatAsuna> nah obsidian games are mostly obviously choices/quests
[4:06:01] <convo445> your history with the franchise is steeped in people guiding you
[4:06:10] <%SainEdge> i mean they know that their community mostly loves this stuff LUL
[4:06:13] <%jinking79> Demon Soul had the easiest endings attack or walk
[4:06:14] <Ecliptic_Origins> P4 with the certain dialogue tree scene
[4:06:20] <+DaBigVitus> why is this an issue? it's a first time playthrough. it's meant to be played several times.
[4:06:20] <ullyzeez> stream over? i finished up work
[4:06:27] <%ChoculaUltra> my favorite secret ending to this day is talking to the bucket too early in Chrono Trigger :)
[4:06:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theyre not supposed to be played with a guide
[4:06:34] <Johannen> @DatAsuna How about New Vegas with secret quests that you unlock by traveling with NPCs along certain landmarks?
[4:06:37] <DatAsuna> The only other game that comes to mind is PT and that's a pseudo ARG game
[4:06:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> youre supposed to stumble upon this, theyre not some mandatory requirement
[4:06:46] <brunoberserk> remember thE bullshit you have to do suikoden 2 TRUE ENDING
[4:06:47] <%Jiggisnipe> they also expect you to play it multiple times
[4:06:48] <convo445> @ullyzeez exactly but Woolie doesn't play games more than once
[4:06:52] <@Solidus_113> Does NieR do it better than FromSoft games?
[4:06:54] <VidulaSaix> @DaBigVitus Its called being a content creator. You dont have the time to spend forever figuring out obtuse things in a game
[4:06:57] <vVAstrAVv> waiting for a fs game with 900 korok seeds lol
[4:07:00] <convo445> no
[4:07:04] <primaryfire> fromsoft truly doesn't give a shit
[4:07:04] <Ecliptic_Origins> absolutely not
[4:07:16] <%Lion_kun> ELDEN RING LET'S GO
[4:07:24] <convo445> @Solidus_113 all weapons all upgraded sucked for the first game
[4:07:25] <@Menitta> cutoff points are bullshit
[4:07:29] <DatAsuna> @Johannen Those just raise their affection points and trigger when the threshhold is met. Above the threshold they just tell you where they wanna go.
[4:07:30] <Klefth> It's literally a "Guide dangit!" moment
[4:07:31] <sundizzle> they make more sense after the fact
[4:07:32] <Ecliptic_Origins> cutoff points suck
[4:07:38] <andre11dr> DS3 has multiple areas just hidden behind secret walls, which i kinda admire
[4:07:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:07:42] <TonberryLives> The Divine Dragon is a pretty clear cutoff LUL
[4:07:42] <DatAsuna> Is it even harder?
[4:07:43] <+DaBigVitus> unreal wooliegoblins
[4:07:45] <urkleturtle> getting red hot flashbacks to ffx-2
[4:07:46] <DatAsuna> It's just slower
[4:07:48] <convo445> for one and done people it's specific to you
[4:07:51] <%SainEdge> yeah I'm also not the biggest fan of some of this stuff, but a lot of fans enjoy trying stuff out and talking about it with other players. And fromsoft knows this
[4:07:55] <samazam94> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli sure, but this is an LP which is a different thing entirely
[4:08:03] <ullyzeez> send GRRM your ideas for ASOIAF to get the true ending for Elden Ring
[4:08:08] <@Solidus_113> For character sidequests it's mostly fine, but not for the main game
[4:08:10] <Johannen> On my first playthrou of Sekiro i got 90% of all the stuff i could do, missed one Headless and the second memory, got the secret ending just by revisiting characters which is not that obtuse
[4:08:16] <OblivionSword1> yeah there's should be a big warning
[4:08:18] <convo445> People play witcher for 100 hours twice for different endings
[4:08:20] <DatAsuna> again the part I lost all tolerance for this was reloading the same NPC 5 times until the right dialogue triggered
[4:08:22] <JotaroStar> !uptime
[4:08:38] <TonberryLives> Fromsoft doesn't care about being nice man
[4:08:40] <ullyzeez> @convo445 yeah but most people also never beat witcher once. game's long man
[4:08:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the thing about the endings is that with save manipulation, you can get all but one ending right at the end if you have all the items
[4:08:50] <+robosqueeb> Those point of no returns are supposed to encourage replayability, but really it just annoys people who play games
[4:08:56] <convo445> @DatAsuna Epicnamebro and souls content creators are crazy enough
[4:08:57] <%LordSDB> SAGA FRONTIER 2 IS SO GOOD!
[4:09:12] <dizimous> I don't like the cut off, but I super don't want them to get rid of the Ministry invading and the ashina levels changing, that shit is rad af
[4:09:13] <primaryfire> wouldn't hurt with a notification before the dragon fight telling you to wrap up your business
[4:09:18] <DatAsuna> I don't care about souls content creators
[4:09:38] <JotaroStar> ericba2Left ericba2Right
[4:09:43] <convo445> Woolie's time with these games were guided like for all of them.
[4:09:52] <andre11dr> DS3 and Bloodborne have HOLE AREAS you can miss ,multiple of them
[4:10:02] <convo445> One can learn how these things work
[4:10:06] <vVAstrAVv> leftraiser is the best remake ever made STILL
[4:10:14] <andre11dr> But makes them cool to me tho
[4:10:34] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god thats miserable
[4:10:45] <vVAstrAVv> thats not true
[4:10:52] <+DaBigVitus> why say you were ready then
[4:10:54] <@Menitta> "Solving" a fromsoft game is not meant to be done solo
[4:10:59] <@Solidus_113> that was your fault
[4:11:01] <Johannen> Hell Yeah, i missed like multiple areas in BB on my first playthrou, i didnt know that they existed so i had no feelings on the matter...end of thought
[4:11:06] <TonberryLives> That's literally not true
[4:11:11] <convo445> but if you get fed the answers instead of spending the time to slurp up every detail you will understand the steps less
[4:11:12] <@Menitta> That's why the messaging system exists
[4:11:16] <vVAstrAVv> i remember grinding elixers for leventhan during ragnarok you just have to use their books
[4:11:45] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I hate how Dragon's Crown has you beat every map once before you can do online multiplayer
[4:11:49] <convo445> @Johannen and then the fans either never go in blind or just play more
[4:11:50] <vVAstrAVv> not fixed youre incorrect lol
[4:11:51] <speximillian> Odin Sphere playthrough when
[4:11:55] <sundizzle> convo445 or you can misread one sentence out of like 50 and completely miss the point because the game didn't make it clear enough
[4:12:14] <ullyzeez> @menitta yup you can totally convey obtuse directions through a fixed set of words
[4:12:23] <TonberryLives> On PS2 you are able to go back into the epilogue sections and stock up (Odin Sphere)
[4:12:29] <convo445> @sundizzle 50 steps are the overexageration you all fall for
[4:12:29] <+DaBigVitus> wooliesplaining
[4:12:40] <NDenizen> Sekiro is pretty much designed for four NG+s on the same save file, admittedly it doesn't make that too clear
[4:12:43] <DatAsuna> I only do another full run when there's only 2-3 ways it can change
[4:12:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolies FOMO energy
[4:12:59] <VidulaSaix> And yet at the same time Sekiro has poor replayability due to lack of build variety
[4:13:02] <urkleturtle> that type of design sensibility comes from a time when a game you bought had to stretch for several months
[4:13:03] <@Solidus_113> The game has to be made around replays, like Gungeon or Noita
[4:13:03] <dds333a> Makes sense. I only replay games I love
[4:13:07] <+Pinkiefan> I %100 agree with Woolie.
[4:13:09] <andre11dr> Well DeS is the WORST with this, considering the Tendency system
[4:13:12] <%wibbwobbler> plenty of that in sekiro
[4:13:24] <andre11dr> It's so hard to get everything in DeS
[4:13:33] <+JingKaisean> the worst part about this is that the ending cutscenes don't even matter
[4:13:36] <+JingKaisean> they're all bad
[4:13:41] <DatAsuna> RIP Automata ending Y
[4:13:43] <dds333a> Not direct
[4:13:44] <+JingKaisean> the real endings are the experiences of the sequences
[4:13:48] <convo445> More balanced people to pay attention to, this is you Woolie and that's ok#
[4:13:50] <DatAsuna> windy
[4:13:50] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus deceitful for the sake of deceit
[4:13:51] <sundizzle> convo445 I'm not saying 50 steps, I'm saying 50 lines of dialogue or text that you can't go back to read and the game is just not helping you figure out what to do. you're ignoring that it actually happens to people
[4:13:53] <DatAsuna> unnatural
[4:14:00] <OblivionSword1> What angle is obtuse again ?
[4:14:11] <DatAsuna> more than 90
[4:14:16] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> More than 90 less than 180
[4:14:20] <Tracazoid> Oh yeah, you gotta do NG+ to complete X-2
[4:14:20] <dds333a> @oblivionsword1 anything higher than 90
[4:14:28] <OblivionSword1> ah alright
[4:14:32] <ullyzeez> woolie doesn't like Yoko Taro games confirmed
[4:14:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Klefth
[4:14:43] <vVAstrAVv> this is why you look up endings lol
[4:14:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:47] <dds333a> @ullyzeez KEKW
[4:14:53] <convo445> @sundizzle it does and then they have to play another game which is the part that pisses people of, then going in blind was the mistake i guess since you always wanted one playthrough
[4:14:54] <Klefth> If you press X while a certain character talks you miss out on percentage in X-2
[4:14:56] <+JingKaisean> lol nier automata was not like this
[4:14:56] <DatAsuna> TBF taro is less obtuse, more grindy
[4:14:59] <VidulaSaix> Nier SPECIFCIALLY tells you
[4:15:03] <andre11dr> I mean yeah, just look it up
[4:15:07] <%ChoculaUltra> idk man, that weapon grinding in Drakengard can eat all of the cocks.
[4:15:10] <@Menitta> Automata is incredibly straight forward
[4:15:12] <+JingKaisean> nier automata was as clear as could fucking be
[4:15:17] <@Menitta> It is sooooo clear
[4:15:19] <@Solidus_113> Still didn't get ending Y though FeelsBadMan
[4:15:20] <DatAsuna> Except Ending Y
[4:15:23] <convo445> it's acts not endings with Nier
[4:15:24] <dds333a> It's more of the game, not NG
[4:15:27] <TonberryLives> It's a straight line
[4:15:27] <%kullumanati> Nier is actually obtuse. Lol
[4:15:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ending Y never LUL
[4:15:34] <@Solidus_113> Max level every weapon in the game
[4:15:36] <Ecliptic_Origins> Nier is crazy
[4:15:37] <+Epic_Fubar> WUT
[4:15:38] <speximillian> Woolie loves liars confirmed
[4:15:40] <DatAsuna> Emil Ending/ OG Ending D is just max level all items
[4:15:41] <convo445> you'd have hated unlocking shit in Nier OHa
[4:15:41] <urkleturtle> he's been doing that shit since drakengard
[4:15:42] <T_Sasquatch> I wish it didn't call it endings
[4:15:53] <Johannen> Yeah some of those endings are super Obtuse
[4:16:07] <convo445> you watched the playthrough of Nier, you'd have been pissed
[4:16:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @T_Sasquatch but they are technically endings
[4:16:11] <DatAsuna> honestly just watch that on video or spend 30 hours grinding materials
[4:16:13] <%jinking79> fuck this I'm going Fishing
[4:16:16] <dds333a> @t_sasquatch technically, they ARE endings, but yeah
[4:16:25] <VidulaSaix> I'd love to see a Reggie Plays Nier Replicant
[4:16:26] <+DaBigVitus> thought the yellow cable was a tube going into minh LUL
[4:16:33] <DatAsuna> You don't wanna deal with automata drop rate BS
[4:16:50] <convo445> The remake of Nier og will be better hopefully
[4:17:12] <dds333a> Woolie only does one route in SMT
[4:17:15] <TonberryLives> This makes me appreciate my absurd memory
[4:17:18] <andre11dr> I like how Woolie made this big statement about Nier and then someone just says "ending Y" and he's like " sure ,whatever" LUL
[4:17:29] <dds333a> Which is fine
[4:17:35] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[4:17:46] <Johannen> You can never win
[4:17:48] <convo445> there's a huge difference in reading about thing and doing it yourself, but also doing it wrong goes nowhere
[4:17:49] <ullyzeez> LUL
[4:17:50] <OblivionSword1> LUL
[4:18:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[4:18:07] <DatAsuna> It's kinda 2 things
[4:18:11] <DatAsuna> Besides the obvious
[4:18:11] <vVAstrAVv> ohhhh
[4:18:20] <speximillian> Would love to see reggie play Nier though
[4:18:20] <VidulaSaix> Liam's a busy boi these days
[4:18:22] <DatAsuna> It will also just take forever on ps4 to get those upgrades
[4:18:29] <andre11dr> I haven't even watched the Nier LP
[4:18:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Lets Watch Nier Auto endings Kappa
[4:18:40] <%Jiggisnipe> what game does that?
[4:18:41] <andre11dr> Also i never got ending Y
[4:18:43] <NDenizen> Golden Sun does that kinda
[4:18:43] <+JingKaisean> God of War?
[4:18:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> sounds like Legend of Zelda
[4:18:54] <%AyotoCorp> MMBN2 did it iirc
[4:18:59] <DatAsuna> technically ending Y is you failing that sidequest
[4:19:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I HAVE ONE
[4:19:09] <+JingKaisean> I thought Woolie got everything in Nier Automata.
[4:19:10] <DatAsuna> was that GS1 or 2?
[4:19:12] <%jinking79> hair color spoil the game
[4:19:19] <convo445> The content matters to Woolie, Nier Content is exhaustive
[4:19:28] <dds333a> It's good when all the NPC's have endgame dialogue which never changes
[4:19:32] <xbb1024> I don't rotate saves, I just create a new one
[4:19:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> noooooo
[4:19:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SHADOW OF DESTINY ON THE PS2
[4:19:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the pain
[4:19:37] <VidulaSaix> Your.... WOOLINGNESS
[4:19:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Shadow of Destiny on PS2 has like 6 endings
[4:19:46] <Klefth> Fucking BOO
[4:19:48] <@Solidus_113> Death Stranding kinda does that, but you get the "2 weeks earlier" note
[4:19:51] <+Pinkiefan> Any chance of you returning to Outer Wilds?
[4:19:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and theyre all different from one another
[4:19:56] <%SainEdge> Dragons Dogma monkaS
[4:19:58] <dds333a> That happened to me in Top Gun on GBA SP
[4:20:12] <convo445> what content is there to miss? endings? there isn't much to souls except killing npcs
[4:20:16] <HorribleHog> you can (not) reload
[4:20:21] <andre11dr> Dude i never beat Tactics Advanced because of a bugged save
[4:20:25] <convo445> motherfucking consequences Minh
[4:20:31] <vVAstrAVv> idk why but even with autosaves i WILL manual save at the end of every sess
[4:20:36] <+JingKaisean> Sekiro (Final)
[4:20:37] <TonberryLives> MELT MAN
[4:20:38] <dds333a> THE SLOUCH
[4:20:38] <%jonblnt> it was a stream
[4:20:42] <%SainEdge> poor Woolie LUL
[4:20:47] <VidulaSaix> MELT HARDMAN
[4:20:47] <urkleturtle> never finished baldur's gate 1 because a quest flag wasn't triggered properly and the game let me continue for 10 hours before it became obvious I couldn't finish it anymore
[4:20:51] <DatAsuna> well a poll won't update in real time
[4:20:54] <vVAstrAVv> we love you minh and your fuck ups
[4:20:56] <convo445> just ask Pat
[4:21:00] <%jonblnt> it's all love guys all love
