[0:02:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> The only thing that could the All-stars Brawl game even better is crossplay
[0:02:41] <@Menitta> I feel tricked
[0:03:15] <@Menitta> now which version of Type Lumina should I get so I can get a total of 20 minutes of lab time in before getting bodied
[0:03:16] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, All Star Brawl is so good.
[0:03:58] <+CaptainPyron> What console are most people playing Nick on?
[0:04:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ah yes, the YouTube to mp3 edition
[0:04:32] <treacherously_> Hey chat! Hope everyone’s good!

[0:04:42] <Mikeymanguy> nick and melty on pc
[0:04:45] <+Inknail> I figure Nick is mostly PC or switch
[0:04:54] <+CaptainPyron> Okie doke.
[0:05:01] <DaKnightWarrior> @captainpyron if you are planing to play this game fir a while you shouls get it on PC
[0:05:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> Are they playing Nick on PC?
[0:05:19] <%ChoculaUltra> its a shame its not crossplay, but I understand the budget restraints. NIckelodeon kneecapped themselves FeelsBadMan
[0:05:54] <+Inknail> Melty has a few hiccups on PC I've heard, compared to PS4/PS5, but the community is probably bigger there on PC

[0:14:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> @iacus_ now we're gonna have to argue pronunciation. Is it "nassbee" or "nassb" with no "-ee" sound at the end?

[0:16:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ChoculaUltra if it's basically Melee but not as heavy with the gravity, I'm 100% in
[0:16:43] <leith_aziz> @taothekoraenchanter Doesnt seem to be. Though it could really use voices

[0:17:00] <@Moobot> @NarcolKuma WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 17 minutes and 8 seconds
[0:17:02] <%ChoculaUltra> @CappuccinoGuil I might be crazy but it legit feels faster than melee at times, often actually
[0:17:04] <BackwardCap> Couldn't really get into Nasb since none of the characters felt fun to use except maybe Reptar.
[0:17:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie is probably gonna go ham, he was a Fox main after all
[0:17:27] <dapperskeleton69> my friend bounced off the game super hard bc of how jank and busted it is
[0:17:34] <leith_aziz> I need to replay a DMC game again. Maybe I can get DMC3 on steam at one point (already played it on PS4, but I play on PC mainly now)
[0:17:42] <%JustYudha> JustYudha subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Yo Woolie, I recently adopted a dog and she gets separation anxiety. But I guess because I put you and Pat's stream so often, whenever I leave I put on your old VODs and it helps calm her down. So that's cool, thanks for the dog ASMR lol
[0:17:46] <taothekoraenchanter> @leith_aziz anything you can compare it to so I have a point of reference?
[0:18:03] <%ChoculaUltra> it really just needs some polish and love - a lot of the animations could use in-between frames and of course voice overs would be great
[0:18:11] <leith_aziz> @taothekoraenchanter I've NEVER played a platform fighter (never owned a Nintendo console either)
[0:18:19] <leith_aziz> So I cant really tell you how they play
[0:18:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ChoculaUltra it's hard for me to describe, but like, going from Smash64 to Melee, I just didn't like how quick you fell down after jumping. I liked the floatiness. Which is why I was happy Brawl was floaty again.
[0:18:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:19:12] <taothekoraenchanter> @leith_aziz ok. thanks anyway
[0:19:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> How many cookies y'all got on Cookie Clicker now? Don't like, you know you're playing it.
[0:19:23] <Deasmeister> Man looking at this reminds me of how much I wanted an avatar fighting game
[0:19:54] <leith_aziz> The fighting games I've spent the most time on is Guilty Gear, Tekken 7 and like 3 hours on SFV. GG I've invested most into, T7 used to be fun at low level, but had enough after red ranks. Never played a platform fighter sadly
[0:20:05] <taothekoraenchanter> @CappuccinoGuil melees still my favorite smash but there are issues with. The floatiness and the  oversensitivity
[0:20:29] <dapperskeleton69> @CappuccinoGuil 10.936 billion per second, prestige 15
[0:20:47] <%ChoculaUltra> I always wanted like a CyberConnect2-style Avatar spectacle fighter
[0:21:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dapperskeleton69 GET THOSE COOKIES, MY GUY!
[0:21:21] <dapperskeleton69> @CappuccinoGuil oh im gettin, im gettin hard. post yo numbers son
[0:21:40] <dapperskeleton69> what's them stocks at
[0:21:52] <leith_aziz> What's the appeal of Cookie Clicker? Just clicking? nicobShrug
[0:21:58] <leith_aziz> Never played it
[0:21:59] <dapperskeleton69> @leith_aziz number go up
[0:22:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dapperskeleton69 56.12 quintillion, 1064 ascencion, waiting on a +18238 ascension now.
[0:22:09] <dapperskeleton69> and also the game still gets updates and just released on steam
[0:22:19] <dapperskeleton69> @CappuccinoGuil niiiiiice
[0:22:29] <taeko_ohnuki> I love this song
[0:22:38] <Shad0wTag> Ah this song takes me back
[0:22:39] <dapperskeleton69> im hoping the halloween season will help boost my numbers a bit
[0:22:41] <stormhawk9891> Yoooo I love this song
[0:22:57] <taothekoraenchanter> name? i like this
[0:23:14] <%CappuccinoGuil> @leith_aziz so, it's about optimization. It's setting something up to get the biggest returns possible. Also, Cookie Clicker has mini-games you can unlock to spice it up a bit more. And, if you like cute things turning into horror, it has that too.

[0:36:55] <%WeepyDevil> that would involve buying a ubisoft game
[0:36:58] <%WeepyDevil> ew gross
[0:36:59] <Shad0wTag> @dapperskeleton69 i hope your ready to hear athena says kaito ball at you nonstop
[0:37:05] <+mattiabh> it depends on the breed tho right? some need more company
[0:37:08] <+Inknail> Outdoors animals only really works in the rural countryside imo
[0:37:11] <Shad0wTag> @brandon__brando based cat dog
[0:37:40] <+Inknail> My parents are lucky enough to live 30min from anywhere, so having outdoors animals is ok. Anywhere near the city is too dangerous imo
[0:37:44] <+Aeoneth> @sonofthedeepsouth does it?  They all looks the same to me
[0:37:45] <%CAPSLOCKlive> Your kid starts wagging like that cat with shaq on that one meme

[0:39:01] <+Inknail> @WeepyDevil yeah, that could definitely be an issue
[0:39:05] <%WeepyDevil> my dog isn't tiny, but i wouldn't trust him to win a fight
[0:39:10] <dapperskeleton69> ever since our dog Whiskey, i don't trust just letting the dog out without a fence because every dog we had could *run*
[0:39:16] <+sonofthedeepsouth> My dog was huge
[0:39:16] <%WeepyDevil> nah its Canada, we got them here too
[0:39:20] <dapperskeleton69> @Shad0wTag his kite takes up the entire screen
[0:39:37] <andre11dr> Even bigger dogs will get jacked up by coyotes

[0:41:34] <%WeepyDevil> oh also not nunavut
[0:41:37] <%Ir0nAgr0> Always good to have new stuff to come back to
[0:41:40] <+Inknail> Old Melty Blood Act Cadenza is what got me back into fighting games in college, and I love French Bread and the games so much
[0:41:44] <leith_aziz> That's how fighters work. I do wonder if MB will use revisions or release DLC characters like the modern model?
[0:41:52] <+PokeysCrypt> roa went from nearly unplayable to the toppest tier over the patches of actress
[0:42:16] <%WeepyDevil> @Inknail there isn't any dlc announced for TL so ???

[0:43:01] <%Prevot> who even owns that
[0:43:07] <leith_aziz> Konami
[0:43:13] <%ggbhtg> IIRC, the boyfriend of one of the voice actor's spearheaded the dub project, and they just asked friends if they wanted to lay some tracks
[0:43:16] <+Inknail> @Inknail not announced yet, but I feel there's no way they're not gonna have at least one set of dlc characters, including sacchin
[0:43:19] <%Prevot> oh so it's never coming back then
[0:43:25] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Invest for the LULZ
[0:43:28] <Deko_> maybe a collection at least?
[0:43:30] <+Exicuren> And on top that the publisher's name is poisoned as heck

[2:08:14] <%mr_sups> This Smash 64 as fuck
[2:08:19] <+froduck42> data hackers have found code for garfield in the game as well
[2:08:20] <+FutaSnek> I'm a proud zim main even tho he sucks
[2:08:22] <sunnythedrunk> Korra is like ganondorf

[2:09:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> There's no charge smash attacks, BTW
[2:09:06] <bazz_tv> I wonder if there is no FOP characters because of Frederator
[2:09:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I need El Tigre in this game
[2:09:14] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:09:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> @menitta Nah Uncle Iroh DLC
[2:09:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Jorge Gutierrez the goat
[2:09:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Think about it
[2:09:24] <Dave_VD> Aang is rightfully top tier. I think he’s objectively the strongest character in lore like how smash 4 bayonetta was justifiably the best
[2:09:36] <%patriotrenegade> The horse from “Hey Dude”
[2:09:37] <bazz_tv> this game is missing a lot of representation

[2:09:47] <+mczarklesby> Did we just start on this one?
[2:09:50] <captain_kirkhammer> @Dave_VD He'll be highest tier when they nerf Tohp, Sandy, and Michelangelo's iunfinites
[2:09:50] <Shad0wTag> she plays her own game
[2:09:53] <GeltonZ> @mczarklesby Yes
[2:09:54] <dds333a> @dave_vd is "lore" the reason LUL
[2:09:55] <Shad0wTag> @mczarklesby yes
[2:10:03] <+mczarklesby> Yay, thanks!
[2:10:06] <+AnActualHermitCrab> The music is so phoned in, lol.
[2:10:12] <Lancaster_H> @bazz_tv there is no way they won't sell the incredibly popular chars as DLC
[2:10:26] <Dave_VD> @dds333a of course not, but it’s nice when things line up like that
[2:10:29] <bazz_tv> no FOP, no Jimmy Neutron, no Rocko, no Angry Beavers and so on
[2:10:33] <captain_kirkhammer> @AnActualHermitCrab apparently there was some kinda rights issue that woulda been *way* outta budget to address
[2:10:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Toph Taunt should be her moving her hamd in front of her face. Cause of the meme
[2:10:39] <%patriotrenegade> Hopefully some insane person will mod in voice lines.

[2:10:50] <dds333a> @dave_vd right
[2:10:52] <GeltonZ> @sonofthedeepsouth It is
[2:10:53] <bazz_tv> the missing reps are going to require a lot of dlc
[2:11:07] <%patriotrenegade> And you marks will pay for them
[2:11:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> PLease, PLEASE tell me Toph's taunt is her doing 'you can't see me'
[2:11:11] <%SirGO0SE> game probably sold better than they expected tbh
[2:11:13] <+Inknail> @sonofthedeepsouth SoonerLater
[2:11:13] <@Solidus_113> sport battle returns from Slap City
[2:11:17] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Hugo Neutron special should be him throwing ducks

[2:11:20] <%SirGO0SE> wouldnt be surprised if it got good support down the line
[2:11:27] <GeltonZ> HA! Football has Arnold's hat.
[2:11:30] <%baka_sugoi> MASH
[2:11:46] <iroh20> what platform
[2:11:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> pc for this
[2:11:54] <+Inknail> I want to pick up that game. Probably on PC, so long as it isn't buggy
[2:11:55] <Shad0wTag> Toph is busted
[2:12:03] <Shad0wTag> Like TOXIC
[2:12:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Boss character Woolie
[2:12:09] <%patriotrenegade> Uh oh

[2:12:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:12:13] <passserby> toph staring straight into the camera is unnerving
[2:12:21] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah nobody looks too great really
[2:12:26] <@Solidus_113> Korra has the FD stage
[2:12:30] <+froduck42> :|
[2:12:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Final Destination is Korra's stage LUL
[2:12:38] <%WeepyDevil> god this game looks cheap
[2:12:42] <dds333a> early ass first episode toph to illustrate how much of a badass she was LUL
[2:12:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WeepyDevil i mean, this was made with like, 0 budget
[2:13:01] <%WeepyDevil> i know
[2:13:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh
[2:13:09] <+yuribo26> That costs money Woolie
[2:13:10] <captain_kirkhammer> NIckelodeon gave Ludocity a button and a shoestring as budget and it shows
[2:13:13] <nmaten> theres a mod i think
[2:13:17] <%Wool> A PC mod came out earlier with full VA
[2:13:18] <%baka_sugoi> a very Budget game
[2:13:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> There's mods
[2:13:19] <Louie_Salmon> Yup, gotta mod that in ASAP
[2:13:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> again, like, 0 budget but they said they plan on getting to get some
[2:13:26] <%WeepyDevil> yeah its rights and money
[2:13:28] <Parapattern> I mean, yeah, but that'd be a pretty  tall order
[2:13:29] <yukichocomilk> that's why you do pc mods
[2:13:29] <+choopercabra> They should have used voice clips from the shows.
[2:13:31] <%rasamune> That makes sense though, logistics-wise
[2:13:33] <bazz_tv> they apparently left the space for audio files in the pc version
[2:13:34] <fuji_n2> Money ye
[2:13:34] <ruggles322> I mean how many voices would return logically?
[2:13:35] <+Inknail> Nick never gives budget to their franchise games
[2:13:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Loud Hoise mains with the incest.
[2:13:38] <%patriotrenegade> That’d be a lot of money and rights haggling
[2:13:40] <CappuccinoGuil> You can change buttons there.
[2:13:42] <%WeepyDevil> @Wool pc master race but for real though
[2:13:42] <+Inknail> see the Korra game as evidence
[2:13:43] <%mr_sups> This gives me Season 0 Power Rangers Vibe
[2:13:52] <%baka_sugoi> PC MODs THO woolieSMUG
[2:13:53] <%WeepyDevil> a fighting game with no voice acting is just...no
[2:13:54] <Th3rd3> modders already taking care of that TPFufun
[2:13:57] <+Kenidashi> Yeah there are already mods to add sounds apparently, so GameBanana is gonna get filled pretty quickly with them.
[2:13:57] <%BisoromiBear> unvoiced Oblina? 0/10
[2:13:58] <CappuccinoGuil> No alt colors, sadly.
[2:14:04] <%WeepyDevil> as much as i'll complan abotu certain characters voices
[2:14:13] <+Kenidashi> There's even a mod manager already up for the game apparently.
[2:14:14] <%WeepyDevil> PSYCHO BALL
[2:14:22] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil aww, so just Leo? okay
[2:14:25] <yukichocomilk> it's funny how this game has no voices and melty has almost too much LUL
[2:14:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's FD
[2:14:30] <@Solidus_113> yep
[2:14:35] <MKII> getting good devs with no budget is better than another shit licenced games that's all flash no substance and no rollback
[2:14:42] <sunnythedrunk> This is def a poverty game wish Nick had given it more love
[2:14:43] <Rionxgarland> playdough fighters
[2:14:45] <iamdonhi> no
[2:14:47] <%WeepyDevil> ooof reggie has shit taste rip
[2:14:48] <mothdude> Melon Lord!
[2:14:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> You shouldnt
[2:14:54] <%WeepyDevil> god this arc of korra sucks
[2:14:56] <@Solidus_113> blind
[2:14:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Korra Book 2 sucks
[2:15:02] <Shad0wTag> Toph just use up special jump on platform and throw rocks
[2:15:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> wait whut did REggie just say LUL
[2:15:09] <+Kenidashi> @Th3SmartAlec and there ya go :D
[2:15:14] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Book 3 is nice I have little to complain about book 3
[2:15:19] <%SirGO0SE> YOO those would make some rad KITES in the background
[2:15:21] <Potatoidea> Yeah, this game isn't the best it could've been, but it's still miles better than most licensed games
[2:15:21] <OldManDeckardCain> *Korra sucks
[2:15:21] <bazz_tv> isn't Tim Curry retired though, even if they could get the voices they might need to use past audio files
[2:15:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a what do you mean? Like, there's a 2nd ninja turtle there, raphael, I think?
[2:15:34] <bear_breaker20> reggie's gonna be haunted by that opinion for a while
[2:15:46] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Why is there time in a smash game?
[2:15:51] <%WeepyDevil> book 3 is just some cool bad guys, which was fine...although book 4 being like "all our villains had deep motivations" is like...fuck no lol
[2:15:54] <Potatoidea> Er, licensed party fighters, that is
[2:15:56] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil I might've missed him, I can be blind at times LUL
[2:16:06] <%WeepyDevil> the red lotus were babies first anarkiddies
[2:16:12] <%brandt_connors> does he have mains yet?
[2:16:13] <dds333a> Still, I doubt donnie is here, which still blows
[2:16:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @sonofthedeepsouth there's always been time in smash. They probably forgot to toggle it off
[2:16:17] <Josef_Stryker> Only thing missing is voice acting. Let's hope this game manages to find success after a rough start like Power Rangers did
[2:16:19] <%WeepyDevil> @sonofthedeepsouth smash normal has time though?
[2:16:22] <bazz_tv> Reggie do up special with Leo, I feel Woolie is going to recognize it
[2:16:24] <DedlokPM> @sonofthedeepsouth Because Timers have always been an option in the Smash games? rooBlank
[2:16:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Why they didnt toggle of tho
[2:16:47] <+Kenidashi> Would HIGHLY recommend changing buttons. 2 matches in, switched buttons, I still had muscle memory from the bad config messing me up for another 3 after.
[2:16:49] <sunnythedrunk> They already have pretty good voice mods
[2:16:52] <dds333a> first touch
[2:16:54] <+Flunkorg> mechanicly this game is amazing... just wish nick didn't just give them a fiver to make to the game.
[2:16:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Do the donkey kong sacrifice
[2:17:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @Josef_Stryker so far, they've probably sold on PC about as many copies as Slap City, so for their history, off to a good start.
[2:17:14] <Josef_Stryker> Does this game have items?
[2:17:26] <bazz_tv> can't believe bot Leo and Mikey hace Tournament fighters references
[2:17:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @Josef_Stryker no items, but it does have stages with hazards
[2:17:33] <sunnythedrunk> Does Reggie know this game has wavedashing?
[2:17:44] <dds333a> @sonofthedeepsouth who does it best, overall, DK, Bowser, or Kirby LUL
[2:17:46] <+Flunkorg> @sunnythedrunk I don't think they know about most mechanics tbh
[2:17:47] <+Inknail> I like the touch of the avatar spirits fighting in the bg
[2:18:12] <bazz_tv> he found it
[2:18:14] <+yuribo26> Toph looks very weird
[2:18:23] <Potatoidea> LUL
[2:18:26] <+Inknail> toph CAN JUST MAKE HER OWN PLATFORMS
[2:18:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Oh no t9ph is minecraft steve
[2:18:33] <Xeno351> tophs wavedash is INSANE
[2:18:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Feels like the bigger, more prominent characters got more love in the animation department, like Spongebob
[2:18:55] <Josef_Stryker> Let's hope this game gets DLC
[2:18:57] <Shad0wTag> @inknail she can indeed and if done right its toxic as all hell
[2:19:01] <+Inknail> toph looks like edge guarding hell
[2:19:07] <CappuccinoGuil> I did one fight and IMMEDIATELY swapped the buttons, it's too weird
[2:19:14] <Josef_Stryker> I want playable Zuko and/or Azula
[2:19:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:19:18] <GeltonZ> @Josef_Stryker At least two confirmed. Datamines indicate Garfield and Shredder are next.
[2:19:19] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:19:25] <Josef_Stryker> Garfield?
[2:19:30] <+Flunkorg> Whats up with woolie always picking boss characters?
[2:19:32] <Josef_Stryker> Nick owns them?
[2:19:32] <+Inknail> garfield is in nick?
[2:19:35] <@Solidus_113> No XJ9 no buy
[2:19:43] <Potatoidea> Viacom, I guess
[2:19:45] <GeltonZ> @Josef_Stryker Garfield. His stage is in. And yes Nick owns Garfield now.
[2:19:46] <captain_kirkhammer> Nick owns the rmedia rights to Garfield, yes
[2:19:53] <sunnythedrunk> Oh yeah everyone has DK cargo throw
[2:19:56] <Josef_Stryker> Would Avatar be the Fire Emblem of NickBrawl?
[2:20:08] <+Flunkorg> You can also grab and counter grab projectiles
[2:20:09] <dds333a> it could get there LUL
[2:20:15] <sunnythedrunk> Someone working on the game apparently implied xj9 is very likely
[2:20:18] <sunnythedrunk> which is PogChamp
[2:20:20] <bazz_tv> Leo is so far the only sword guy
[2:20:22] <+Flunkorg> I've had that lead to amazing shenanigans
[2:20:33] <sunnythedrunk> likely dlc i mea
[2:20:34] <+Inknail> dude, just grabbing toph's rocks and throwing them back sounds right
[2:20:41] <GeltonZ> @sunnythedrunk Really? That's good. I was worried the whole Frderator thing was getting in the way.
[2:20:57] <Xeno351> nah spongebob will probably be the fire emblem of this game
[2:20:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Leonardo now top tuer
[2:20:59] <Josef_Stryker> I wonder if they could add unique throw animations next time. It'd help to give the characters more personality
[2:21:05] <%baka_sugoi> who would be DLC for this game?
[2:21:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Toph moved to mid tier Kappa
[2:21:10] <@Solidus_113> Crimson Chin
[2:21:17] <+Flunkorg> @Josef_Stryker If theirs a next time...
[2:21:17] <Josef_Stryker> Donnie and Raph should be an eventuality
[2:21:20] <sunnythedrunk> @GeltonZ Nah apparently that's not an issue. The reason FAirly Oddparents has issues may be because it airs on disney in some other countries
[2:21:21] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus just FYI, the camera is blocking the damage numbers, if that matters.
[2:21:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> What abot N-Chin?
[2:21:29] <Lancaster_H> @baka_sugoi the entire rest of the avatar franchise
[2:21:32] <Xeno351> Garfield and shredder, rocko maybe?
[2:21:36] <GeltonZ> @sunnythedrunk HUH. Weird.
[2:21:44] <bazz_tv> I hope for a Glitch Tech rep but is really unlikely because Nick outright killed that shoe
[2:21:48] <GeltonZ> I want Rocko pretty bad, yeah.
[2:21:50] <bazz_tv> show*
[2:21:52] <%baka_sugoi> @Lancaster_H LUL
[2:21:53] <KeiPrime> the grumble is already on the options screen where is he in the roster
[2:21:53] <+yuribo26> Hits feel very light, almost no impact
[2:21:54] <%RyuuAoi> Keenan and Kel DLC when?
[2:21:59] <%SirGO0SE> a little bass
[2:22:04] <dds333a> @ryuuaoi LUL LUL
[2:22:06] <+yuribo26> Zim is a fucked up show
[2:22:07] <+Inknail> Zuko would be good, but the avatar roster is already big
[2:22:08] <captain_kirkhammer> It's the BEST
[2:22:14] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Drake&Josh DLC Kappa
[2:22:20] <sunnythedrunk> Invade Zim is goated
[2:22:20] <+AnActualHermitCrab> Apparently Zim is low-tier af. LUL
[2:22:24] <+R0kushi> breakfast stage though
[2:22:26] <+Taglog7> is nick a thing in Canada?
[2:22:30] <+AnActualHermitCrab> The CHARACTER, not the show.
[2:22:32] <captain_kirkhammer> @AnActualHermitCrab Only F tier in game
[2:22:32] <+Inknail> I'd love a dedicated Avatar fighting game
[2:22:33] <+Flunkorg> @Taglog7 yes
[2:22:33] <KeiPrime> the milk is dangerous
[2:22:36] <GeltonZ> @Inknail They have an announcer clip for Zuko so he's on the menu...and TMNT is getting a 4th character so...
[2:22:37] <dds333a> LUL
[2:22:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> "I know better now"
[2:22:37] <DedlokPM> @CappuccinoGuil I was going to comment on it, but we can see the 10s and hundreds digit of woolie's life so we can still see all of the pertient info
[2:22:38] <Potatoidea> LUL
[2:22:44] <+yuribo26> Milk death monkaS
[2:22:51] <passserby> oh god, Gir's dead
[2:22:51] <DaKnightWarrior> Aang is shiek with kill power. It's so good.
[2:22:52] <Xeno351> zim is the zoner, and the designers made the game to be interactive so
[2:23:00] <+Inknail> @GeltonZ RyuChamp
[2:23:06] <%baka_sugoi> Shrek when?
[2:23:12] <Potatoidea> Gottem
[2:23:14] <Shardlab> Hahahahaha
[2:23:15] <+Taglog7> meltman wen?
[2:23:18] <Kristoffers> haha
[2:23:19] <+Flunkorg> Milk is DEATH
[2:23:21] <bazz_tv> Shrek isn nickelodeon
[2:23:21] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Excuse me
[2:23:21] <Shardlab> The Milk Is Deadly!!!
[2:23:24] <dds333a> woah aang has tech
[2:23:27] <Xeno351> game is JANK tho don't get it twisted
[2:23:32] <GeltonZ> @GeltonZ @Inknail To be fair they have like...30 announcer voice clips for potential characters so they wouldn't have to rehire the announcer XD
[2:23:41] <KeiPrime> wheres the hidden temple stage
[2:23:45] <zenith0111> Does this game have items and other game modes?
[2:23:52] <thunka10> Nope
[2:23:54] <KeiPrime> there sport mode but no items
[2:23:56] <+Inknail> @GeltonZ lol, I guess that figures
[2:23:59] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 Its got other modes, but no items.
[2:24:03] <dds333a> @keiprime I hear that LUL SeemsGood
[2:24:03] <+Das_Prints> No voice acting really hurts for some characters like Zim.
[2:24:04] <GeltonZ> @KeiPrime Good idea! Datamines found a Double Dare stage so...YEAH! Hidden Temple!
[2:24:05] <CappuccinoGuil> Death pit right in the middle, let's goooooo
[2:24:07] <bazz_tv> Harvey Beaks would  be an obscure pit
[2:24:07] <%MutedMimic> jadezzSussy
[2:24:11] <DaKnightWarrior> No items.
[2:24:11] <zenith0111> Stages kind of boand
[2:24:15] <zenith0111> bland*
[2:24:16] <+Inknail> FINAL DESTINATION
[2:24:18] <bazz_tv> pick*
[2:24:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> And the final destination begins
[2:24:30] <+Taglog7> WutFace the cheese
[2:24:38] <Xeno351> good thing about pc is people are already getting voice packs made
[2:24:38] <DedlokPM> The other ren and stimpy stage is like poke floats but worse
[2:24:45] <KeiPrime> yall dont wanna go to the video zone and fight mongo?
[2:24:58] <KeiPrime> tHAT TURKEY IS HAIry
[2:24:58] <+Flunkorg> @DedlokPM pretty impressive to make a worst poke float
[2:24:58] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LeRouch_the_Rebel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Since Comedy Central and Nickelodeon are both under Viacom, Cartman, Bender, and Captain Hero are all technically possible DLC KappaHD.
[2:25:05] <Shardlab> The game is barely out a week and everyone is already making lottery tickets for "Who Gets In". Yeesh
[2:25:16] <zenith0111> @xeno351 Free labors the best
[2:25:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Stage shenanigans
[2:25:33] <T_Sasquatch> @shardlab welcome to smash obsession
[2:25:38] <+Flunkorg> @Shardlab This game will have made it if they start having money matchs in EVO's toilets.
[2:25:46] <sunnythedrunk> Avatar state aka the worst move in the game LUL
[2:26:05] <zenith0111> Weird stage
[2:26:06] <dds333a> @flunkorg exactly. melty will inspire then
[2:26:07] <+R0kushi> gotta love it
[2:26:09] <T_Sasquatch> The fact this game exists is insane to me
[2:26:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Poke Floats?
[2:26:17] <Potatoidea> This gets to take up Smash's mantle as far as people clamoring for characters goes

[2:26:20] <Shardlab> Only the lip of the plate
[2:26:21] <@Solidus_113> not really
[2:26:22] <DedlokPM> @DedlokPM auto scroll and all the platforms sink while someone stands on them. rooSuffer
[2:26:27] <T_Sasquatch> T o a s t y
[2:26:34] <@Solidus_113> there's been a bunch of other nick smash clones
[2:26:34] <zenith0111> @t_sasquatch How. Nick has done tons of other games just like this
[2:26:34] <Zuzu_Pachulia> mmm, sugar frosted milk...
[2:26:43] <KeiPrime> oh the space madness stage is really bad
[2:26:51] <+Flunkorg> @Solidus_113 I think he means a *good* one
[2:26:56] <Xeno351> @zenith0111 what are you talking about, this is a good game
[2:26:59] <T_Sasquatch> @zenith0111 yea but actually decent looking
[2:27:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @DedlokPM @DedlokPM don't forget the one platform that is jelly/jam so you slowly fall through it.
[2:27:00] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Okay but put in Ultra Lord tho
[2:27:00] <%ggbhtg> there's no tap jump
[2:27:02] <DaKnightWarrior> This games jank in all the right ways.
[2:27:07] <sunnythedrunk> I think they are adding tap jump in an update
[2:27:13] <vodska> bro this stage looks so cool fr
[2:27:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Will the guy who took a huge shit in Ren Stimpy make it?
[2:27:25] <JayEarly> It’s strange how little money Nick put into this vs the dev effort
[2:27:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I forgot his name
[2:27:48] <Potatoidea> Jellyfish Fields is basically Smashville, iirc, so that could be a good pick
[2:27:54] <+Flunkorg> Its like the devs said "We're gonna make an awesome game!" and nick was like "yeah yeah yeah get out of my office"
[2:27:59] <sunnythedrunk> That was a clash
[2:28:03] <CappuccinoGuil> @sonofthedeepsouth They should add final smashes and Ren and Stimpy's is just that one scene where they are "sawing wood" Kreygasm
[2:28:24] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil vigorously LUL
[2:28:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Death everywhere
[2:28:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> @cappuccinoguil L
[2:28:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Bro, I'm pretty sure everyone in this game has SPIKES
[2:28:31] <GenmaKido> majinoGameplay dont like that
[2:28:32] <zenith0111> @xeno351 Lmao good onr
[2:28:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:28:33] <KeiPrime> the less said about ren and stimpy adult party the better
[2:28:55] <+Flunkorg> @KeiPrime Gotta educate the masses on it somehow though
[2:28:59] <DaKnightWarrior> Zim's spikes are nasty.
[2:29:00] <Qsmash_> this stage is huge lol
[2:29:02] <Shardlab> @JayEarly The devs care. Nick just wants some money
[2:29:16] <KeiPrime> in an archival/educational sense i guess
[2:29:23] <zenith0111> Too bad Rend and Stimpys creators an asshole
[2:29:34] <Xeno351> devs are the slap city crew so they saw an opportunity and took the hell out of it
[2:29:35] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> @zenith0111 and possible a sex pest
[2:29:35] <sunnythedrunk> yeah the devs care but Nick is cheap af
[2:29:46] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 Sadly, thats true about a lot of cartoons.
[2:29:47] <+Inknail> what is this music?
[2:29:54] <KeiPrime> john k has been a known groomer for a WHiLe
[2:29:59] <zenith0111> @lerouch_the_rebel and abused his animation staff
[2:30:05] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> facts
[2:30:12] <CappuccinoGuil> The animation LUL
[2:30:18] <+Flunkorg> I think the airbender writter was cool though? I hope so anyway
[2:30:36] <Shardlab> April OP
[2:30:38] <dds333a> @flunkorg as far as we know LUL
[2:30:45] <JetpackMcQuack> All that… personality
[2:30:45] <missingangle> Could they not just take audio from the shows themselves? How odd
[2:30:47] <+pupil31> My name is not Rick
[2:30:47] <@Solidus_113> Max would mute the game music and play stuff like Marvel 2
[2:30:52] <+pectusumbra> @WoolieVersus there are apparently voice mods for PC already, and the devs did say if the game did well getting the VA work done is on the table
[2:30:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Games to play at night when your parents tell you to go too sleep Kappa
[2:30:55] <KeiPrime> patrick has a REAL 360
[2:30:57] <captain_kirkhammer> lmao second worst character, even with command grabs
[2:30:59] <%baka_sugoi> P A T R I C K STAAARRR woolieGASM
[2:31:00] <+itsjayrome> didnt know there was no voice acting and now i dont think i can buy this
[2:31:03] <KeiPrime> end on his down special
[2:31:05] <JayEarly> Mute Nigel is like a fucking SCP
[2:31:06] <KeiPrime> for big damage
[2:31:09] <+Inknail> is airbender writer working on Dragon Prince now?
[2:31:11] <Solidnick18> this is patrick!
[2:31:15] <DaKnightWarrior> Toxic Patrick mains baby!
[2:31:19] <Shardlab> The Avatar folks were alright. Ambitious, but they're okay
[2:31:19] <sunnythedrunk> @itsjayrome you can mod voices in pretty easily
[2:31:23] <+itsjayrome> oh neat
[2:31:27] <Xeno351> @itsjayrome just get it on pc lots of mods already
[2:31:27] <+dakarplaugas> Patrick can Gannon people off the edge
[2:31:32] <+Flunkorg> @itsjayrome Unfortunetly, the game will only recieve more budget if it sells well enough for nick to care.
[2:31:32] <+OzdotTV> Lythero plays a mean fucking Patrick
[2:31:36] <%ggbhtg> there's no tap jump option yet
[2:31:45] <zenith0111> Who did this games music? its like iconic and stock at the same time?
[2:31:48] <+dakarplaugas> Patricide that man
[2:31:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> NO, THIS IS PATRICK KEKW
[2:31:51] <Potatoidea> LUL
[2:31:55] <dds333a> LUL
[2:31:56] <Solidnick18> nice
[2:31:59] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:32:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:32:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> amazin
[2:32:08] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 One of the devs AFAIK
[2:32:12] <CappuccinoGuil> This stage has some BANGERS
[2:32:12] <dds333a> No pity stock LUL
[2:32:28] <DaKnightWarrior> no homie stock :(
[2:32:29] <dds333a> what
[2:32:34] <zenith0111> I wish Zims stage was the meat factory
[2:32:36] <Xeno351> @itsjayrome like its the smash community doing mod support for this game and they REFUSE to let their games die
[2:32:45] <+itsjayrome> dope
[2:32:46] <Shad0wTag> COMMAND GRAB THAT TOAST
[2:32:53] <Xeno351> they'll probably make better rollback too LUL
[2:33:02] <+itsjayrome> yeah ive followed melee for a long ass time i know how that crowd is
[2:33:05] <Solidnick18> do it
[2:33:07] <+Flunkorg> oh right this game has rollback I forgot
[2:33:11] <nastybagl> is this on steam?
[2:33:15] <CappuccinoGuil> yes
[2:33:18] <KeiPrime> yes its on steam
[2:33:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:33:18] <+Flunkorg> @nastybagl yes
[2:33:23] <Xeno351> it's bad rollback tho, like real bad
[2:33:24] <JayEarly> Isn’t this games rollback already good
[2:33:28] <nastybagl> oh
[2:33:31] <Solidnick18> a very good move
[2:33:36] <+Flunkorg> @Xeno351 Like, is it still better then no rollback?
[2:33:39] <zenith0111> I heard its bad netcode
[2:33:51] <@Solidus_113> it's only really bad on more that 2 players
[2:33:52] <CappuccinoGuil> I heard the netcode was good, though?
[2:33:58] <@Solidus_113> than*
[2:34:03] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah this game and melty's rollback (at least on PC) are pretty bad
[2:34:05] <@Menitta> oh wow that win pose is gteat
[2:34:06] <zenith0111> No fighting games with 4 players can have rollback.
[2:34:12] <Xeno351> better than no rollback for sure but it only really works if your close, like same few states
[2:34:15] <dds333a> woolz is a fuck for that LUL
[2:34:20] <+Flunkorg> Thats fine, 4 players is more for fun (IMO)
[2:34:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @sunnythedrunk wait melty has bad rollback? aw man...
[2:34:33] <zenith0111> @flunkorg No duh
[2:34:38] <Xeno351> otherwise oh boy......
[2:34:38] <@Menitta> So how's Korra in this
[2:34:46] <zenith0111> And its a shame playing it a max capacity is the worst way
[2:34:54] <sunnythedrunk> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ don't know about the console port but PC is bad
[2:34:54] <JayEarly> Melty’s rollback is mostly fine as long as you don’t skip the intro
[2:34:57] <Shad0wTag> @menitta She's fine but not crazy
[2:35:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah I see
[2:35:19] <@Menitta> I heard shes the Captain Falcon
[2:35:19] <+Flunkorg> @sunnythedrunk Concidering how most people play melty, it could probably come out with local only and most of the fanbase wouldn't care. (lol)
[2:35:28] <CappuccinoGuil> Korra's taunt should've just been her kissing Asami, best moment in the series
[2:35:35] <zenith0111> No voice clips is so cursed. Idk why they allowed that
[2:35:46] <+Inknail> @CappuccinoGuil did they ever kiss?
[2:35:48] <+Flunkorg> @CappuccinoGuil Did you hear about how hard they had to fight for that scene?
[2:35:52] <DaKnightWarrior> Toastman is Captain Falcon
[2:35:54] <+pectusumbra> the devs did talk about it, would have been over half the budget for va work
[2:36:01] <Shad0wTag> command grab this toast
[2:36:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @zenith0111 I don't think they had a choice. It's not easy getting all the rights and VAs together, nor cheap
[2:36:05] <+Inknail> I thought they just held hands
[2:36:17] <CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil @Inknail it's literally the show's finally
[2:36:21] <CappuccinoGuil> finale*
[2:36:23] <zenith0111> @cappuccinoguil Yeah shame Nickelodeon doesnt own them
[2:36:25] <JayEarly> Melty really should have disabled intro skipping online
[2:36:29] <zenith0111> ifcHm
[2:36:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @Flunkorg uuuuuurgh don't remind me how hard it was to get that queer rep in there
[2:36:45] <@Menitta> Dont worry theres gonna be Melty Type Lumina community edition that launches through dos later
[2:36:49] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:36:51] <%TubeMan642> Catdog
[2:36:59] <+Flunkorg> @Menitta As it should
[2:36:59] <Xeno351> the built this game in a cave with scraps. also zenith0111 is a troll incase anyone hasn't noticed
[2:37:04] <Potatoidea> Don't worry about it
[2:37:11] <%baka_sugoi> BUT DO SHE GOT THAT LOUD?
[2:37:15] <%RyuuAoi> Where's Jenny the teenage robot?
[2:37:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Fuck Lucy Loud, she wrecks my shit up LUL
[2:37:20] <dds333a> @menitta DOS LUL
[2:37:38] <+Flunkorg> Tony Stark making the Mk.I but its these devs making this game
[2:37:38] <DaKnightWarrior> Lucy is strong as hell so far.
[2:37:38] <zenith0111> @flunkorg What have I said to get insulted? Fuck you
[2:37:49] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 ....what
[2:38:07] <+Inknail> @CappuccinoGuil I watched it not long ago with my sister. I could have sworn the finale was them holding hands as they went into the spirit realm
[2:38:08] <Potatoidea> Is this Brinstar/Zebes?
[2:38:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Spongebob's special is being the most marketable character on the roster
[2:38:20] <zenith0111> @flunkorg Oops wrong dude lmao
[2:38:24] <dds333a> in smash it's the edge recovery, yeah
[2:38:26] <JayEarly> Loud House characters weirdly favored in terms of visual quality
[2:38:31] <KeiPrime> do spongebobs taunt
[2:38:40] <+Inknail> Lucy notso Loud
[2:38:42] <dds333a> at varying heights
[2:38:46] <fuji_n2> She has 3 modes that change her moves btw woolie
[2:38:55] <+Flunkorg> Wait, is it all projectiles you can grab right?
[2:39:06] <CappuccinoGuil> @zenith0111 you do know that they'd have to pay the VAs again to do the work for this, right? It's not about the devs getting the rights, it's really costly. And I' don't think the budget was that big in this, which is a shame.
[2:39:08] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus Lucy is a stance character, the aura she has can change the properties of her moves
[2:39:21] <zenith0111> @cappuccinoguil Shame Nickelodeons broke
[2:39:27] <DaKnightWarrior> You can cancel anything out of Dash Attack.
[2:39:28] <dds333a> reg throwing LUL
[2:39:31] <zenith0111> Its not like they own hotels
[2:39:49] <KeiPrime> nick is owned by viacom so theres money
[2:39:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @zenith0111 are you ignoring literally every argument I'm making? Just because they have the money, doesn't mean they are gonna give it, dude.
[2:39:58] <KeiPrime> which is paramount now?
[2:40:00] <zenith0111> Spaongebob must be doing so poorly then
[2:40:29] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 tbf, nick can do backdoor deals. Its definitly NOT beneath them.
[2:40:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:41:03] <+Inknail> Nickolodeon simply never gives any budget to the devs they hire for games
[2:41:14] <@Menitta> Nick does so little for games
[2:41:28] <passserby> licorice monster
[2:41:30] <dds333a> it's a real monster LUL
[2:41:36] <TheFinalHazard> didnt a nick kart racer come out within the past year or so that also had no budget
[2:41:39] <+pectusumbra> I think she's Lydia? Ahh! Real Monsters!
[2:41:40] <%BisoromiBear> Oblina Kreygasm
[2:41:46] <dds333a> Oblina LUL
[2:41:48] <passserby> what is that clay person in the house
[2:41:50] <captain_kirkhammer> Ickis was the main guy weird they chose Oblina
[2:41:52] <+Inknail> They hired PLATINUM games to do the Korra game. And it's good for its budget, but you can tell they were constrained
[2:41:58] <passserby> that's kinda scary looking
[2:41:58] <TigerClaws12> booba
[2:41:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> are there any licensed Nick games that aren't janky and low budget?
[2:41:59] <KeiPrime> krumm got shafted
[2:42:03] <%RyuuAoi> No Nickelodeon in Canada?
[2:42:04] <KumaTorey> it might have been a miracle for this game to exist, feel like the dev team was like "yo nick can we do like a smash game?" and nick/viacom is like: "yea sure whatever"
[2:42:09] <+pectusumbra> ah, got ya. It's been a LONG stime since I've seen ahh real monsters
[2:42:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> like what is the best one
[2:42:10] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going? Do they already have their mains?
[2:42:11] <zenith0111> @cappuccinoguil Im not saying your wrong im just not going to lie and say its good
[2:42:14] <%RyuuAoi> Watch some American tv, Reggie!
[2:42:18] <+Flunkorg> @Inknail You can tell they tried there best with what they had there
[2:42:22] <zenith0111> Or even acceptable
[2:42:25] <dds333a> @dan_g_v getting there LUL
[2:42:30] <%baka_sugoi> LOG DLC WHN
[2:42:36] <dan_g_v> ah, the nostalgia XD
[2:42:44] <GenmaKido> ren n stimpy really just sits in our brains, rotting
[2:42:45] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie watched it, Reggie!
[2:42:46] <dan_g_v> @dds333a nice!
[2:42:49] <DaKnightWarrior> Oblina is so fun.
[2:42:54] <zenith0111> Its bullshit they didnt even pull clips from the show or even grunts
[2:42:57] <Xeno351> @ReallyBigRocks battle for bikini bottom remake? but that doesn't count because if you look at original dev notes, my god
[2:43:02] <Shardlab> We already have Log. What we need as this game's crossover boss character is PLANK
[2:43:14] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 Liscensing extends to that unfortunetly.
[2:43:15] <dan_g_v> have they seen the fair stage with the sad clown shoes music? Did they love it like everybody else?
[2:43:16] <+Inknail> @zenith0111 wouldn't they still have to credit/pay the VAs to do that?
[2:43:30] <dds333a> @shardlab get of the century LUL
[2:43:32] <VJdarkworld> @zenith0111 it does suck how nickelodeon only gave devs bare minimum
[2:43:34] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 Yep, and other people to
[2:43:41] <zenith0111> I know that but you guys saying it everytime isnt changing my mind it sucks
[2:43:48] <zenith0111> Wake up
[2:43:58] <VJdarkworld> @zenith0111 wake up sheeple !
[2:44:06] <sunnythedrunk> There was a Sandy infinite
[2:44:06] <GeltonZ> Oh it absolutely sucks, just watcha gonna do?
[2:44:10] <sunnythedrunk> it got patched out
[2:44:13] <zenith0111> Not play
[2:44:14] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean they could just cut up voice clips from the shows - no VA work necessary
[2:44:16] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 Oh, I'm not disagreeing with you, its just like... what can you do? lol
[2:44:30] <KeiPrime> nature of the beast, esp with licensed games
[2:44:31] <zenith0111> Goodbye Nick brawlers
[2:44:33] <+Inknail> oh yeah, it def sucks, but they put Toph in, so how can I just NOT play?
[2:44:37] <GeltonZ> @ChoculaUltra Still gotta deal with contract nonsense
[2:44:41] <sunnythedrunk> @ChoculaUltra Still requires you to pay the voice actors royalties
[2:44:43] <+ARedBard> @zenith0111 Are you okay?
[2:44:46] <+pectusumbra> Think of it as Early Access I suppose. Buy with intent of improvements but no promise you'll get them
[2:44:49] <%ChoculaUltra> ah true true, royalties
[2:44:50] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:45:00] <zenith0111> @aredbard Are you ok?
[2:45:02] <+Flunkorg> @zenith0111 As long as big streamer like max support it, it can crawl out from the muck.
[2:45:07] <KumaTorey> the dev team did say they hope to add in stuff moving forward, i think they were pressured to just get it OUT fast
[2:45:22] <zenith0111> This doesnt look rushed
[2:45:27] <KeiPrime> so this is the sf5 of smash clones? Kappa
[2:45:28] <dds333a> log danmaku out here LUL
[2:45:35] <sunnythedrunk> This game was originally supposed to be delayed two months but they went ahead and released it with the intent to add a bunch of stuff along the way
[2:45:36] <rusell4> @Woolie Any Melty Blood today?
[2:45:44] <dds333a> after this
[2:45:47] <+Flunkorg> @KeiPrime nah, this games actually got some solid tech
[2:45:50] <Shardlab> It's been a week. All we can do is tell it through the grapevine that the game is fun and that might get enough people to buy and play it to warrant more interest and money from the rights holders to improve it
[2:45:51] <+pectusumbra> Yeah, it's the last game of the day
[2:46:10] <rusell4> okay thanks.
[2:46:24] <+Inknail> Maybe it having sales numbers will make some Nick execs realize that this is worth investing in
[2:46:42] <sunnythedrunk> It sold 100k copies on day 1, hopefully this will convince Nick to invest more money
[2:46:42] <@Menitta> I'd like to try the game at some point
[2:46:43] <zenith0111> @aredbard I just dont like having no voice clips. Is that so crazy?
[2:46:50] <+Flunkorg> @Inknail Or, at the very least, advertise it a little more./
[2:46:52] <zenith0111> I guess that makes me crazy
[2:46:56] <+Crazyjack1> ive been addicted to this game id love a chance to introduce my helga
[2:47:03] <VJdarkworld> videogame fun :)
[2:47:08] <%BisoromiBear> when's the live action version? I want to main Kel damn it.
[2:47:12] <yukichocomilk> there are pc mods to add voices anyway
[2:47:25] <Xeno351> pc mods to add better music too
[2:47:34] <@Menitta> Those pc mods came out immediately
[2:47:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:47:37] <sunnythedrunk> I just downloaded a She hulk mod for Korra LUL
[2:47:37] <%ggbhtg> no tap jump yet
[2:47:42] <zenith0111> Mods =/= Fixing it yourself
[2:47:51] <+Flunkorg> @Menitta Suspecious if you think about it lol
[2:47:53] <%ggbhtg> So there WERE Day 1 jab reset infinites, but it was due to a bug, which got patched already LUL @WoolieVersus
[2:47:55] <zenith0111> Fix it for them chat
[2:47:59] <KeiPrime> everyone dropping that master volume to 10, cause its too flippin loud
[2:47:59] <dds333a> Reporting from Channel 6
[2:48:01] <Shardlab> @BisoromiBear When you make it with SFM like a certain other game that was shown on this stream and featured "bonus characters"
[2:48:05] <yukichocomilk> @zenith0111 what is even your point?
[2:48:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> reptar has chain grabs with nis normal grab
[2:48:17] <sunnythedrunk> Reptar is nuts
[2:48:20] <DaKnightWarrior> Reptar baby!
[2:48:20] <zenith0111> @yukichocomilk Its lazy they didnt
[2:48:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> reptar can chain his normal grab into itself

[2:48:32] <Josef_Stryker> inb4 they add All Grown Up versions of the Rugrats
[2:48:33] <%iHum4n> What about rugrats all grown up?
[2:48:34] <zenith0111> "But zenith the money"
[2:48:37] <+pectusumbra> STOP! I am Reptar! Stop! I am Reptar!
[2:48:38] <VJdarkworld> @zenith0111 yeh nickelodeon is lazy not supporting the devs
[2:48:47] <+Inknail> Teach those babies to wavedash
[2:48:49] <Shardlab> I'm being so facetious, it's not even actually worth it
[2:48:49] <dds333a> if they wanted to, they could pull from all grown up, shitty as it was LUL
[2:48:50] <+ARedBard> @zenith0111 Are you just here to whine the entire time?
[2:48:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Tommy's final smash: Attempted Fratricide
[2:48:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> charge the fireball
[2:48:55] <@Menitta> @zenith0111 please chill.
[2:48:57] <yukichocomilk> calling the devs lazy for not having budget or support is insane
[2:49:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> it becomes a falcon punch beam
[2:49:11] <+pectusumbra> Get the ghost kid, Bean, from the tv movie of all grown up
[2:49:12] <dds333a> but Rep is the in universe mascot anyway LUL
[2:49:16] <Xeno351> i did say they were a troll way early, you choosing to intract with it is on yu
[2:49:16] <Josef_Stryker> Is Reptar the Bowser of the game?
[2:49:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @Josef_Stryker Patrick seems to be the bowser
[2:49:25] <+Boner_Girl> Where's Doug?
[2:49:29] <+AugustRei> april's moves charge up her neutral special
[2:49:30] <@Menitta> Reptar being the Bowser is sick
[2:49:31] <zenith0111> @aredbard Yes actually
[2:49:35] <sunnythedrunk> Never forget Nick cut short last airbender and then literally ruined Korra by telling them the show was ending every season
[2:49:36] <StarMechV> Charge Reptar's Specials
[2:49:44] <zenith0111> I guess I need to spell it out x.x
[2:49:46] <StarMechV> THERE WE GO
[2:49:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> reptar can charge is neutral special and his down special
[2:49:51] <KeiPrime> doug is disney now? but nick still shows the old dougs
[2:49:52] <dds333a> @boner_girl there was something about that I think
[2:49:53] <KumaTorey> what this game lacks all i can say is "welp zombie41Shrug thats just how it is". i dont get hung up on what is Ought to be. is the game fun and playable?
[2:49:53] <DaKnightWarrior> Bowser and incineroar but fast as hell
[2:50:01] <+OzdotTV> there's been some data mine leaks for this game with info on potential characters. Y'all can find them on this game's subreddit if you want.

[2:50:40] <%eyezehuhh> eyezehuhh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Happy strum everyone! Does this game have anything to rival crumpet dashing? Much love. be good to yourselves everyone!
[2:50:45] <sunnythedrunk> @Inknail Seriously, one of the most influential shows ever and they tried to short change it
[2:50:45] <+Parrish_broadnax> April is kinda snapped
[2:50:49] <Shardlab> @sunnythedrunk Yup, during that era, if it wasn't Spongebob or a live action show, Nick wanted it gone
[2:50:56] <@Menitta> ngl I've been thinking about reinstalling Korra Platinum
[2:50:59] <StarMechV> Press the jump button while down to jump off platforms
[2:51:04] <sunnythedrunk> @Shardlab yep so backwards
[2:51:10] <KeiPrime> that datamine feels like a wishlist more than a real list but id love the proven wrong on that
[2:51:11] <KumaTorey> @Parrish_broadnax lizzWAVES
[2:51:17] <+Parrish_broadnax> Aye Kuma!
[2:51:19] <DaKnightWarrior> Reptar best boi
[2:51:23] <+Parrish_broadnax> eogHey
[2:51:24] <dds333a> do that again LULagain
[2:51:51] <sunnythedrunk> Reptar's flame breath does 30 it's insane
[2:51:51] <+OzdotTV> @keiprime Hopefully it's successful enough that the becomes a solid reality
[2:51:54] <+Inknail> @Menitta It wasn't long ago that I last played it. The game holds up as far as action games go
[2:51:58] <Shardlab> @KeiPrime Doug's latter seasons and it's current rights holder is Disney. The old seasons that were first shown on Nick can probably be shown by them in perpetuity
[2:52:00] <+OzdotTV> *list
[2:52:10] <dds333a> @sunnythedrunk to an extent, yeah
[2:52:15] <StarMechV> @WoolieVersus Heavy attacks work as rock paper scissors mechanic: Up attacks beat down attacks; Down attacks beat mids, and mids beat up.s That weird state you guys go in is when you're beating at these clashes it causes stagger
[2:52:26] <@Menitta> @inknail some of the bosses arent great but Korra felt really good to control
[2:52:26] <KumaTorey> this game basically is just a fan game but actually endorsed by Nickelodeon LUL
[2:52:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @Shardlab Doug is gonna be the Sora of thsi game LUL
[2:52:49] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:53:02] <sunnythedrunk> @dds333a It's crazy for tech chases and on the edge, although he's still not like S tier or anything
[2:53:04] <Pt_Kamen> will he have a DOUG button?
[2:53:22] <+Parrish_broadnax> look at that star meter
[2:53:22] <CappuccinoGuil> April has traaash vertical recovery, the AI killed itself twice on Aang's stage when I was doing Arcade, it's hilarious
[2:53:28] <sunnythedrunk> I really want a Rocket Power rep but I feel like there not much of an audience for it
[2:53:30] <Shardlab> @CappuccinoGuil Look. I find Quailman and Silver Skeeter as amusing as the next guy, but I want Krill and XJ9 to be in a sequel or DLC before we ever seen them
[2:53:40] <KeiPrime> like a real tutorial explaining how that RPS on the heavies would be nice
[2:53:53] <+Parrish_broadnax> If we can have powedered toasst man, I see no reason why we cant have a rocket power rep
[2:53:55] <KeiPrime> nerf silver skeeter he';s too strong
[2:53:59] <inorwise> no wave dashes... BibleThump
[2:54:02] <zenith0111> Does this have combo trials?
[2:54:08] <zenith0111> Mission modes?
[2:54:19] <KumaTorey> angry beavers are the True Ice Climbers choice
[2:54:26] <Gunnehsan> danny phantom is umvc3 nova-like lol
[2:54:27] <Shardlab> @KeiPrime He's just Mr Game & Watch
[2:54:30] <dds333a> @kumatorey SeemsGood
[2:54:31] <CappuccinoGuil> @Shardlab I meant more of the difficulty of licensing and getting him in because Disney, but for sure, XJ9 needs to be in here
[2:54:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the tech
[2:54:42] <DaKnightWarrior> @kumatorey yeyeye
[2:54:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[2:54:43] <MamokZalku> na game is barebones
[2:54:54] <+Parrish_broadnax> I want the Aggro crag. Not as a stage. as a playable Character
[2:55:10] <dds333a> the wall LUL
[2:55:16] <%Afterman_> go with nigel
[2:55:18] <sunnythedrunk> Olmec would be sick
[2:55:18] <%Afterman_> hes got some good tech
[2:55:19] <MamokZalku> no xj9 is bs
[2:55:20] <mariosonicboss> danny is raw show
[2:55:21] <zenith0111> Danny is the zoomer cartoon
[2:55:21] <Moondoggie25> mark summers or no buy
[2:55:21] <@Menitta> Aw yeah Korra
[2:55:25] <@Solidus_113> you were like 5 years too late for Danny
[2:55:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> Danny Phantom was mid 2000s
[2:55:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if I remember danny phantom was pretty good, his evil version was cool
[2:55:37] <%RyuuAoi> Danny Phantom was legit.
[2:55:37] <zenith0111> Danny was literally the start of zoomer toons
[2:55:39] <Shardlab> @CappuccinoGuil Yeah, I'm just not sure how many folks are clamoring for Doug. I mean... I just watched it when nothing else was on
[2:55:41] <%baka_sugoi> American Anime NotLikeThis
[2:55:43] <+OzdotTV> @parrish_broadnax aggro crag would be the most toxic ledge hogger
[2:55:48] <DaKnightWarrior> Danny was solid
[2:55:48] <+Inknail> Dony da best
[2:55:48] <dds333a> same
[2:55:52] <CappuccinoGuil> Danny Phantom introduced young milennials to great goth girls
[2:55:52] <quietshun> Yeah Dany phantom was pretty good
[2:55:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's the boring one
[2:55:56] <xabyrn1> Doug was a top tier show but it’s fully owned by Disney
[2:55:57] <Zeif00> Pizza
[2:56:02] <%Afterman_> @zenith0111 nah. danny was like 3 or 4 years before zoomer
[2:56:04] <%RyuuAoi> @cappuccinoguil TRU
[2:56:05] <+pectusumbra> Mikey's the zany one, what?
[2:56:09] <JetpackMcQuack> someone has to hold the shit together
[2:56:11] <MamokZalku> vektroLFG xj9 better be dlc
[2:56:14] <+Boner_Girl> atpIzza atpNinja atpIzza atpNinja atpIzza atpNinja
[2:56:14] <Gunnehsan> just keep nair-ing with mikey
[2:56:16] <+Parrish_broadnax> this songs pretty great
[2:56:18] <eriksdrums> Aesthetic until we die with Donatello
[2:56:26] <Moondoggie25> the fact there is no fairly oddparents reps is confusing
[2:56:27] <+OzdotTV> @cappuccinoguil the holy truth
[2:56:29] <Charlie_Xmas> Best song is the Bus stage
[2:56:30] <fuji_n2> Woolie likes the purple turtle? Wha Kappa
[2:56:36] <DaKnightWarrior> Korra feels like the ryu of this game.
[2:56:40] <KumaTorey> Danny Phantom: the show Butch Hartman has ownership over even tho he did like 10% of the work. basically being That kid in school who doesnt do the report in a group but does the presentation part so "he totally did it"
[2:56:49] <zenith0111> @afterman_ Theres a actually gen chart. All millennials are at 95' everything past that is the next gen
[2:56:56] <Shardlab> Woolie.... No. We had better animated series that were doing cool stuff. Butch Hartman's stuff was derivative of Powerpuff Girls
[2:57:03] <KeiPrime> real question is helga a shoto
[2:57:06] <+Boner_Girl> Shouldnt Korra be doing more cool stuff with water
[2:57:08] <@Menitta> Danny Phantom was alright
[2:57:24] <@Menitta> I was the age for it at least lol
[2:57:24] <xabyrn1> Helga is not a shoto but she’s good as hell in this game
[2:57:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @KumaTorey oh yeah, thank you for the reminder. Daily "Fuck Butch Hartman" post. *ahem* Fuck Butch Hartman
[2:57:30] <+pectusumbra> Whatever else, danny phantom was a cool show
[2:57:31] <%Sparkseid> sajamJam
[2:57:33] <KumaTorey> @KeiPrime Helga is Yamazaki LUL
[2:57:44] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil wasn't her act being boring? something like that.
[2:57:55] <@Solidus_113> Jimmy, Odd Parents, Danny, Teenage Robot, and Zim are tail end of Millennial TV
[2:57:59] <fuji_n2> Nah Korra is all elements from the get go
[2:57:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a who?
[2:58:02] <%mighty_max_t> mighty_max_t subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Thanks for all you do in showcasing fighting games. Before you & Best Friends, I played like 5 of them. Now I have a 3 page document of different games & mains, even though I barely play them. Just dabbling and supporting the genre is enough. Much respect
[2:58:03] <%Afterman_> @zenith0111 yeah but during its air time zoomers would have been like actual babies. I grew up w/ danny and im not a zoomer
[2:58:04] <sunnythedrunk> I mean butch hartman ended up making good shows, he's just an asshole as a person
[2:58:10] <+Inknail> @Boner_Girl water's harder to animate probably
[2:58:18] <+Parrish_broadnax> You get hit by the Korra punch, you just die
[2:58:19] <+Crazyjack1> mickey is the best character he has 0 to death combos and infinite stalling/recovery
[2:58:22] <Shardlab> @Boner_Girl The Avatar more known for fighting with all her elements being like Aang? Naw
[2:58:33] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil the goth vegan, or whatever
[2:58:35] <@Menitta> Nah Zoomers would be like 6 or 7
[2:58:40] <KumaTorey> @CappuccinoGuil yep. part of me wants to see danny phantom get rebooted and be like totally separated from Butch
[2:58:48] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:58:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a oh my friend, but you're forgetting: there were multiple goth girls in Danny Phantom.
[2:59:05] <KeiPrime> danny phantom always felt like budget ben10 is all im sayin
[2:59:08] <Moondoggie25> kinda upsetting that Aang is probably the worst animated character in the game
[2:59:12] <+pectusumbra> @Boner_Girl I mean not for nothing I can see them focusing on specific elements for avatar characters to not step on other possible characters.
[2:59:13] <Josef_Stryker> Playable Ember when?
[2:59:16] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[2:59:27] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil wait, are you counting the ghosts too LUL
[2:59:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> @KeiPrime gettin a lotta boss baby vibes from this
[2:59:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KeiPrime nah nah nah nah other way around fam
[2:59:34] <KumaTorey> Oh my god. I know who needs to get in simS TAK from Tak & the Power of JuJu
[2:59:35] <chippybippers> it's time.
[2:59:38] <Gunnehsan> catdog has INSANE DP
[2:59:39] <CappuccinoGuil> I loved Hey Arnold, except for Helga. Did not enjoy that someone who bullies him for YEARS eventually canonically marries him, because "girls bully you because they have feelings for you"
[2:59:43] <passserby> best stage theme SourPls
[2:59:48] <DaKnightWarrior> Catdog and those nasty hitboxes
[2:59:48] <RedPlasticCup> le catdoge
[2:59:51] <+pectusumbra> I mean for Avatar we could still get Zuko, Azula, and Asami as options
[2:59:51] <%baka_sugoi> He ain't LOUD tho
[2:59:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a Abso-fucking-lutely.
[2:59:54] <JetpackMcQuack> my favorite abomination
[2:59:56] <Moondoggie25> the scream lol
[2:59:57] <Shardlab> For those of us who grew up without cable, how much of this do ya'll know about from osmosis?
[2:59:57] <passserby> screaming really pulls it all together
[3:00:02] <Pt_Kamen> when they get in the Rock Paper Scissors mechanic of the attacks then we'll get mind games
[3:00:03] <@Solidus_113> the one good song
[3:00:05] <+Inknail> that stock scream mix
[3:00:06] <KeiPrime> the danny phantom stage tho
[3:00:11] <%townzzzzz> catdog a tale brothers
[3:00:11] <MamokZalku> loser get bullied
[3:00:16] <Hammatime8> One of CatDog's moves is seriously Cat trying to Murder dog LUL
[3:00:18] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> majinoPokimane
[3:00:20] <sunnythedrunk> Lincoln loud aka budget cartoon Ness
[3:00:20] <Gunnehsan> you could probably RB your bone ?
[3:00:22] <%mighty_max_t> Danny Phantom definitely felt weak, animation wise, but it had some KILLER character designs
[3:00:23] <%baka_sugoi> stance
[3:00:23] <%RyuuAoi> They could use Tommy and Chucky from "All Grown Up"
[3:00:26] <yukichocomilk> it's actually the scream from ahh monsters
[3:00:26] <+pectusumbra> Always loved Catdog. The halloween episode is a lot of fun
[3:00:27] <+OzdotTV> I'm honestly surprised that Tak wasn't already a base-game inclusion to the roster
[3:00:33] <Shardlab> Because if you grew up with just broadcast TV, this game is filled with unfamiliar nonsense
[3:00:42] <Josef_Stryker> I forget if those Tak games were good or not
[3:00:46] <%baka_sugoi> cat dog was hella weird
[3:00:54] <Josef_Stryker> Or if it's one of those series that somehow got more games
[3:00:54] <Louie_Salmon> Cadog has different moves if you switch sides btw
[3:00:55] <Cobaltor_252> has Woolie figured out the side switch yet
[3:00:58] <dds333a> @josef_stryker they're not
[3:00:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, is catdog's down b swapping the sides so he has a new moveset?
[3:01:05] <zenith0111> Cat Dog shows premise went fucking nowhere
[3:01:06] <KeiPrime> swole dog
[3:01:06] <+pectusumbra> The Catdog Christmas episode was also a really good christmas bit
[3:01:09] <MamokZalku> xj9 not in the game makes my blood
[3:01:10] <Moondoggie25> i think nick is just trying to keep tak and the power of juju locked away
[3:01:18] <+Inknail> AH REAL MONSTERS BEAT DROP

[3:01:30] <+OzdotTV> @moondoggie25 those cowards
[3:01:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Moondoggie25 probably for the best
[3:01:33] <Electro96> i don't know why this track is so much better than anything else in the game
[3:01:34] <+ChrisAlgoo> 100% here for triplet woolie

[3:05:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @DaKnightWarrior that's... that's 3 characters too many
[3:06:01] <KeiPrime> when you gonna pass stoop kid
[3:06:10] <KeiPrime> i got my eyes peeled for him
[3:06:27] <+Kenidashi> @ReallyBigRocks ...this is as close as this game will get to MvC2 music, huh.

[3:07:06] <Shad0wTag> @inknail retired
[3:07:08] <CappuccinoGuil> This stage is really cool. The BGM is spot on for Hey Arnold
[3:07:15] <+OzdotTV> @inknail I thought he just doesn't really do acting anymore because of his current health condition, but I could be wrong
[3:07:23] <FlowLethal> driver is real final boss

[3:09:05] <passserby> no sir, I don't like it
[3:09:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> I mean, this is technically BS since Danny has full flight in the canon, but yeah he's Mewtwo here.
[3:09:14] <+silvery_cricket> No fighting has even occured

[3:09:50] <KeiPrime> you thought it was banned this is double banned
[3:09:53] <MrSkerpentine> If you think this stage is super-banned, wait till they play on the other Ren & Stimpy stage...
[3:09:54] <CappuccinoGuil> We never knew how good we had with Pokefloats NotLikeThis
[3:09:55] <DaKnightWarrior> This is so toxic i love it lol
[3:10:06] <%Sunriser41> worse pokefloats, they did it somehow
[3:10:15] <+silvery_cricket> 3rd opponent is the goddamn stage omg
[3:10:18] <zenith0111> Devs clearly loved pokefloats
[3:10:20] <+OzdotTV> @inknail yeah he had a stroke in 2012 & is bound to a wheel chair. he still does voice acting & some singing apparently so maybe he's just expensive to get for their budget.
[3:10:40] <alphalejandro> I never understan the hype for this games, it's because the Nickelodeon characters?

[3:11:03] <DaKnightWarrior> This stage banned too
[3:11:07] <+Inknail> @OzdotTV dang, and I love that guy's work
[3:11:11] <KeiPrime> grandpa in the back just taking a nap
[3:11:14] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[3:11:15] <KeiPrime> thats real rugrats
[3:11:15] <zenith0111> Whos stage is this
[3:11:16] <GeltonZ> @alphalejandro Nah it's because the devs are huge Smash fans that made a solid Smash clone called Slap City. Also rollback.
[3:11:17] <+OzdotTV> @inknail same
[3:11:19] <BoxNavy> its nice that smash has some quality kusoge now
[3:11:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> head first
[3:11:22] <+pectusumbra> @alphalejandro That and being made by small but proven devs of Slap City
[3:11:22] <zenith0111> Is this Sandys stage?
[3:11:22] <Paragon_of_Laziness> @alphalejandro people just want someone other than nintendo to make smash
[3:11:25] <MrSkerpentine> @alphalejandro that plus them appealing super hard to the competitive community
[3:11:32] <KreuzDrache> @zenith0111 rugrats stage
[3:11:34] <BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[3:11:35] <DaKnightWarrior> Reptars stage.
[3:11:42] <zenith0111> Gotcha
[3:11:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> twice lol
[3:11:45] <%MacMog> so this is a rival to Rivals of Aether
[3:11:49] <BoxNavy> gg :)
[3:11:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ggs shake my hand
[3:11:51] <+Parrish_broadnax> Ah Gottem GGs shake my hand
[3:11:51] <zenith0111> I never got into Rugrats
[3:11:51] <+silvery_cricket> BANNED STAGE
[3:11:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> DO IT
[3:11:57] <Jp_DrZaius> gg
[3:11:57] <+Inknail> @alphalejandro what others said. Good devs, popular characters, and potentially better netcode than smash
[3:11:59] <iroh20> Reggie you bad bro
[3:11:59] <BoxNavy> there are some KILLERS online
[3:12:03] <MrSkerpentine> I’m sad Reptar’s stage isn’t a destructible model city ala that one level in Psychonauts
[3:12:07] <alphalejandro> Ok
[3:12:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> people are in fact here
[3:12:18] <dds333a> killers waiting in the wings
[3:12:20] <MrSkerpentine> @inknail IT USES ROLLBACK NOT EVEN JOKING
[3:12:22] <zenith0111> Was Rugrats good? Tommys design freaked me oit too much to watch
[3:12:29] <@Solidus_113> create
[3:12:38] <+pectusumbra> you're searching rather than creating
[3:12:41] <DedlokPM> @alphalejandro nick characters + smash is the reason for the hype. That and the dev proved themselves for he smash formula thanks to one of their other games, Slap City, which used characters from their other games
[3:12:56] <KreuzDrache> It was okay cartoon I feel
[3:12:57] <+Inknail> @MrSkerpentine I heard the rollback on consoles is limited to 1v1 though
[3:13:08] <KreuzDrache> I was not the biggest fan of it, but there were some good moments
[3:13:11] <Qu1ckyyy> Why not 2vs2?
[3:13:14] <%SirGO0SE> oh man we gonna see some shit today
[3:13:40] <sunnythedrunk> It might lag
[3:13:41] <captain_kirkhammer> @MrSkerpentine only on the switch iirc
[3:13:41] <zenith0111> Team Woolz and Reggie
[3:13:41] <Gunnehsan> it'd be whacky
[3:13:43] <KeiPrime> yeah the way lobbies work, you can just keep one room going and multiple matches is really cool
[3:13:43] <MamokZalku> Ludosity should be thanked for even entertaining this
[3:13:46] <JetpackMcQuack> 4D rollback
[3:13:51] <BoxNavy> the rollbacks a bit crusty sometimes just be warned
[3:13:54] <%Gamefriendly> oh shit for once theres a game where the PC version is better?
[3:13:58] <+Inknail> Yeah, PC sounds like the good system here
[3:14:13] <+Inknail> Hopefully, everyone has their ethernets
[3:14:20] <OldManDeckardCain> "for once" people forgetting strive already LUL
[3:14:20] <dds333a> @mamokzalku more for making it better than the ones that came before
[3:14:25] <CappuccinoGuil> you can spectate? cool
[3:14:31] <+silvery_cricket> REN AND STIMPY LETS GO
[3:14:32] <DaKnightWarrior> Join us Woolie.
[3:14:41] <%ggbhtg> teams was in a separate menu
[3:14:43] <Memitim> FFA
[3:14:44] <Jp_DrZaius> Ffa
[3:14:48] <zenith0111> For for all is the purest
[3:14:55] <+Inknail> oh, you can see connections live
[3:15:05] <dds333a> every man for himself
[3:15:07] <%Gamefriendly> @OldManDeckardCain true, i mixed up the console perfomance shenanigans for the Pc version
[3:15:16] <KreuzDrache> this sounds like metroid music
[3:15:27] <MamokZalku> the shockwave games from ages ago?
[3:15:32] <zenith0111> THE TECHNODROME
[3:15:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Spectating is DOPE
[3:16:10] <KreuzDrache> also it seems like all the tmnt references are from the 80s cartoon? not early 2000 and mid 2000s?
[3:16:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:16:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @KreuzDrache the designs are from the 80s cartoon, right?
[3:16:29] <dds333a> @kreuzdrache seems like
[3:16:37] <zenith0111> @kreuzdrache Technically theyre all canonically connected so its fine
[3:16:42] <dds333a> classic Krang, so on
[3:16:43] <KeiPrime> i thought i saw one of the models change to the 2000s era style during one attack but i could be just losing my mind
[3:16:48] <KreuzDrache> yeah, I was expecting them to mix them up in this game
[3:17:16] <zenith0111> It would have been cool if each color change was a different gen of TMNT
[3:17:31] <KreuzDrache> NOW THAT would be great!
[3:17:42] <Josef_Stryker> IIRC the devs said they plan to implement alt colours in a later update
[3:17:45] <zenith0111> I need my Noir Turtles
[3:17:46] <+Inknail> like power rangers  bftg
[3:17:48] <JetpackMcQuack> what a match
[3:17:55] <Gunnehsan> so i guess you could bring two local players online in the same lobby?
[3:17:57] <KingSpunf> Is there any way this game is different from Smash? Not to be mean
[3:17:58] <KreuzDrache> YEAH GIVE US THE COMIC TURTLES
[3:18:01] <DaKnightWarrior> Oblina is so fast.
[3:18:03] <%ggbhtg> Team Setup: highlight New Match > select Custom > Max Players 4 > scroll down to Additional Rules > turn Teams On and Friendly Fire On
[3:18:08] <+Inknail> nice match
[3:18:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> give us the chain grabs
[3:18:24] <FlowLethal> Piranha plant
[3:18:27] <dds333a> get the 80s version, 2000s reboot, and then 2012 (?) reboot, hmm
[3:18:36] <zenith0111> This UI is not kid friendly
[3:18:36] <+OzdotTV> It would be so dope to see the gritty comic turtles as alt skins
[3:18:59] <KreuzDrache> also, looks like Dani is character in the future? Seems odd for him to be in the mune
[3:19:01] <BoxNavy> friendly fire on would be funny
[3:19:01] <KreuzDrache> menu*
[3:19:03] <dds333a> @ozdottv all red? les go LUL
[3:19:11] <ExpressNode> Those rocks look like potatoes
[3:19:40] <%Wool> I'm shocked a 4 player match felt that smooth
[3:19:52] <KingSpunf> As if anyone under 25 cares about TMNT and Aaah Real Monsters lol
[3:19:53] <zenith0111> It doesnt look bad
[3:19:58] <GeltonZ> @Wool Same! And very happy about that.
[3:20:04] <LinxGG> the game def needs voice acting, it would make the game feel whole
[3:20:21] <+Story_Ark> @kingspunf bro they literally have a tmnt reboot every few years
[3:20:26] <+OzdotTV> I think I saw someone say 100k on day 1
[3:20:34] <Heyestus> The characters seem weird without the voices
[3:20:36] <+Brownsugar579> voice acting already modded in
[3:20:38] <+OzdotTV> *100k sales
[3:20:41] <ExpressNode> Is he on PC?
[3:20:48] <+Parrish_broadnax> he is
[3:21:11] <+Brownsugar579> also you can get the sound track for mvc2 for the game
[3:21:22] <KreuzDrache> YOOOOOO
[3:21:39] <zenith0111> The music tracks flows nicely into each othee
[3:22:01] <aaron600greenknight> Hi Woolie

[3:26:06] <KeiPrime> they need like a purple leo, or a red mikey Kappa
[3:26:07] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus how did the match feel with me playing with you from Brazil?
[3:26:15] <MrSkerpentine> @damnyell_ it’s being added in the near future. The files for alts are already in the game, it’s just weird they aren’t already in

[3:29:22] <$Kingnencha> I think the competitive  mode only uses some of the stages due to laggy ones like that
[3:29:23] <DaKnightWarrior> Gen 4 got the best legendaries
[3:29:25] <dds333a> LUL
[3:29:25] <algi80> noone makes games with PhysX anymore, right?

[3:31:59] <DedlokPM> Like if it was named Viacom All Stars, sure
[3:32:15] <phatmac16> It’s funny that melty has the most shield for tonight’s fighting games

[3:34:57] <+Inknail> great combos, but ethernet required
[3:34:58] <eriksdrums> cool*
[3:35:04] <%DashXero> @CappuccinoGuil Oh. I knew about that. I was wondering what was going on with the connection stuff.
[3:35:11] <%Gamefriendly> anyone else think the sound effects area really flat and underwhelming
[3:35:14] <zepelinnn1> *CABLE AT RISK*
[3:35:28] <zenith0111> @gamefriendly Yes
[3:35:39] <+Inknail> @Gamefriendly they are, but I think even more is missing due to no voice
[3:35:44] <Overloard> patricks dash is lulsy
[3:35:46] <%Gamefriendly> that too for sure
[3:35:48] <brunoberserk> man  , this game REALLY need some voices or more sound effects
[3:35:53] <+skylerpilot> yeah, everything about the games sound design is WEAK
[3:35:55] <Qu1ckyyy> @Gamefriendly I don't think it's the sound effects, the lack of voices is probably causing this akwardness
[3:36:00] <zenith0111> If the sound effects had more oomf I wouldnt notice the lack of VA

[3:39:35] <KeiPrime> thats that worms 2 sound pack energy w/r/t sound mods  already existing

[3:43:18] <+Brownsugar579> once again you nailed it reggie

[3:50:11] <StarMechV> ooooh they were making a joke
[3:50:19] <StarMechV> too bad i'm an idiot lol
[3:50:19] <%probably_facetious> @chief_chongo Yes
[3:50:22] <badguy8312> @chief_chongo no, just broken
[3:50:23] <zenith0111> CatDog is Zelda/Sheik
[3:50:28] <StarMechV> Are they playing on PC?
[3:50:29] <+chief_chongo> i dont know what to believe
[3:50:33] <dds333a> ye
[3:50:40] <GeltonZ> @StarMechV Yup
[3:50:46] <%probably_facetious> You can swap which one's active.
[3:50:51] <+chief_chongo> goptcha
[3:50:55] <+Inknail> catdog looks like such a cursed character lol
[3:51:10] <metabot64> despite the sorta jank animation and lack of voice overs,  I have a pretty good feeling about this game.
[3:51:13] <@Menitta> yknow this game just makes me more pissed at Playstation All Stars
[3:51:18] <Paragon_of_Laziness> why is catdog?
[3:51:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[3:51:25] <+Inknail> @Menitta agreed
[3:51:30] <+tuchpi> yep LUL
[3:51:38] <metabot64> iirc hbox put catdog at the top
[3:51:38] <%kinetikpaws> catdog and reptar are top tier apparently
[3:51:43] <+Inknail> why couldn't they have just settled with ripping off smash harder
[3:51:45] <DaKnightWarrior> Catdog is very strong so far.
[3:51:51] <zenith0111> @menitta In what ways
[3:52:03] <%ggbhtg> In lobbies, there's no queue. All fights are simultaneous. When you select a match (with rules you didn't create), you're joining someone else's fight. @WoolieVersus
[3:52:05] <badguy8312> down air
[3:52:08] <badguy8312> or dair
[3:52:12] <alphalejandro> Die Bob
[3:52:14] <%Gamefriendly> "you guys"
[3:52:14] <%probably_facetious> @kinetikpaws Toph is literally better brawl metaknight
[3:52:16] <black_mages_matter_> woolie was about to say moon drive
[3:52:17] <Dreary_Sun> what about tilts?
[3:52:17] <+cavefishes> any chance you could move your cams to the corner so we can see the health/stock bars better?
[3:52:21] <badguy8312> spike or meteor
[3:52:22] <DaKnightWarrior> Reptar seems mid/high tier.
[3:52:32] <BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:52:44] <%ggbhtg> I get ya
[3:52:45] <@Menitta> PSASBR has no game to it because all you gotta do is have a super and then thats how you kill. All it had to do is rip off smash
[3:52:48] <metabot64> the secret to ripping of smash apparently is not to try to make your own spin but to rip off of it harder
[3:52:52] <dds333a> @cavefishes or just at the top of the screen
[3:53:04] <%ggbhtg> it's fine it's fine
[3:53:04] <lonosis47> What
[3:53:06] <captain_kirkhammer> @DaKnightWarrior he's the line of playability in this game like ganondorf is in melee
[3:53:08] <GeltonZ> @Menitta Or even just have regular ass HP!
[3:53:09] <zenith0111> @menitta Yeah the gameplay freaking sucked
[3:53:18] <+Inknail> @metabot64 commit to the plagiarism
[3:53:26] <DaKnightWarrior> @captain_kirkhammer indeed
[3:53:30] <metabot64> cuz this looks alot better than the cartoon network ripoff and the playstation
[3:53:58] <dds333a> @metabot64 much
[3:54:13] <zenith0111> SPIKED
[3:54:14] <%kinetikpaws> yoooo
[3:54:17] <alphalejandro> Airbending spike
[3:54:17] <+Inknail> I agree, it'd be nice if they could move the camera to a corner, at least for this game
[3:54:45] <%Sunriser41> @metabot64 yea, this game is very fun, even if it needs more polish
[3:54:47] <zenith0111> The last air bender still got some tricks
[3:54:59] <sunnythedrunk> Damn Reggie kinda nice with it
[3:55:00] <+Inknail> Reggie is killing it today
[3:55:22] <DaKnightWarrior> Reggie and that Melee blood

[3:58:21] <@Menitta> Leo is in fact a turtle to be fair LUL
[3:58:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:58:30] <MeyB_7> you guys mentioned he non inclution of voice acting. but lest we forget no openinig themes.
[3:58:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @badguy8312 hold LT and you can strafe
[3:58:36] <StarMechV> This and the Hey Arnold's stage have the best songs
[3:58:36] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:58:38] <%probably_facetious> @zenith0111 Definitely not tournament legal
[3:58:41] <@Menitta> oh yo
[3:58:57] <%Gamefriendly> maybe woolie's accidentally strafing?
[3:58:57] <black_mages_matter_> theres a thing in smash called B reverse, are you doing that by accident? that can turn you around

[3:59:02] <eriksdrums> Hey, sound tech!  Loving the music!  "Thanks, I worked really hard to make it great!"  Yeah man!  I can't wait to hear the voices!  ".....voicies?"
[3:59:04] <sunnythedrunk> SourPls
[3:59:09] <badguy8312> @cappuccinoguil it sounds like a replacement for the c stick to do retreating aerials, probably takes a while to get used to i imagine
[3:59:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ludosity's music team with the BANGERS
[3:59:15] <zenith0111> Danny Phantom always had banger tracks
[3:59:16] <TigerClaws12> is this danny's stage?
[3:59:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TigerClaws12 yes
[3:59:28] <DedlokPM> @TigerClaws12 yes

[3:59:52] <%ggbhtg> ggs LUL
[3:59:55] <badguy8312> we tech those?
[4:00:07] <WinstonFromUndertale> @choculaultra they did have reptar on ice so 😂
[4:00:24] <popuhatto> Man, I won't be surprised if they released a voice pack of this game as paid DLC
[4:00:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> Umashu's hazard spiked an opponent for me once, it was awesome
[4:00:42] <zenith0111> Happy happy joy joy
[4:00:47] <+Inknail> oh man, this stage has carts?
[4:00:58] <%ChoculaUltra> @WinstonFromUndertale his schmovement HAS to be a reference to that LUL
[4:01:05] <zenith0111> Carts drag you to the bottm right?
[4:01:31] <TheDr0t> cabbage easter egg?
[4:01:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh yeah its the cabbage guy
[4:02:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TheDr0t devs said there's something with the cabbage guy that sounded like a possible hazard, but not sure
[4:02:17] <badguy8312> @zenith0111 I think these ones just hit you, you might be thinking about great cave offensive carts
[4:02:23] <%kinetikpaws> Zelda temple big
[4:02:45] <TheDr0t> is there a point of buying this game if i never played any stage fighters and have no friends to play this with?
[4:03:06] <%ChoculaUltra> there's matchmaking iirc
[4:03:11] <DaKnightWarrior> It is but you makes your fart stronger.
[4:03:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TheDr0t I mean, do you like the idea of the stage fighter and would you like to play with strangers online?
[4:03:15] <zenith0111> You can lose to strangers online and get hatemail for winning
[4:03:16] <badguy8312> @thedr0t true, but have you considered *PEER PRESSURE*
[4:03:19] <DedlokPM> It's a absorb counter that you hit special again to unleash when filled
[4:03:43] <badguy8312> sounds like game and watch down b
[4:03:48] <TigerClaws12> they fixed the frame rate issue on big stages?
[4:03:55] <Gunnehsan> it's basically G&W bucket but wario waft
[4:04:03] <Gunnehsan> 3 times iirc
[4:04:17] <black_mages_matter_> IT USED THE MEME SOUND EFFECT?
[4:04:28] <TheDr0t> @badguy8312 only friend out of the group who have income only playes anime gachas and shit like warthunder
[4:04:30] <+Rada150> i needs more reverb
[4:04:31] <zenith0111> The stock sound effect yes
[4:04:34] <+Rada150> it*
[4:04:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> that's a good strat with April's camera drop
[4:04:37] <TigerClaws12> 200% LUL

[4:04:41] <badguy8312> it's a fartprank!!!
[4:04:45] <zenith0111> Everything uses that fart sound
[4:05:18] <%ggbhtg> reminder that Capp is in Brazil
[4:05:26] <%ggbhtg> so let's see how this gooooeos
[4:05:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:05:29] <%ggbhtg> *goes
[4:05:44] <@Solidus_113> oh boy, jungle japes
[4:05:46] <%ChoculaUltra> its smoove so far
[4:06:12] <+Rada150> supposedly they datamining aside from the 2 characters had the announcer say a ton of names of characters that weren't included like Rocko so apparently the devs have future releases planned out
[4:06:49] <zenith0111> Do you guys remember the song at the end of the rugrats movie?
[4:07:03] <GeltonZ> More like "Oh man lets get this guy to say every name we can think of so we don't have to hire him again" XD
[4:07:03] <DaKnightWarrior> not enough space on this stage.
[4:07:09] <captain_kirkhammer> @Rada150 that just sounds like future-proofing
[4:07:13] <DaKnightWarrior> alot of small platforms
[4:07:16] <@Menitta> Its not Al anymore. its DUNK
[4:07:21] <dds333a> geddan
[4:07:24] <Gunnehsan> can someone show woolie how nasty nigel is
[4:07:31] <DedlokPM> @Rada150 that or putting in all the possibilities that could happen so they don't have to hire the announcer again
[4:07:32] <zenith0111> Ledge Teeter
[4:07:41] <+Rekinsinn> which platform?

[4:08:06] <%ggbhtg> L I V I N
[4:08:06] <zenith0111> Surprised no Dib
[4:08:11] <+Rada150> also according to Hungrybox interview with the devs Goku is on the table though they don't have an announcer file for him, so they are trying to get rights from all over
[4:08:18] <Gunnehsan> don't forget you can grab most projectiles
[4:08:33] <alphalejandro> This looks like a DK stage
[4:08:54] <TheDr0t> who's that dino character?

[4:22:27] <BackwardCap> gildedVibe
[4:22:28] <+Inknail> calling it, Reggie will main Noel because of her throw
[4:22:32] <DaKnightWarrior> Love this game so far. Can't stop fighting.
[4:22:32] <Deko_> 3-4 bars works fine but game really needs to show ping
[4:22:40] <%snausages_> i don't think its just wifi warriors, the netcode just seems weirdly brittle and fucked up
[4:22:46] <%chief_chongo> i would say that you froze the blood and melted it, but the ice guy is brand new so
[4:22:48] <+Inknail> I've played TL on ps4, had only 2 or 3 hiccupy matches

[4:23:31] <phatmac16> @BubbaRands Miyako came first no?
[4:23:31] <zenith0111> Short Hair

[4:25:22] <black_mages_matter_> im guessing aoko or satsuki is first dlc personally, but i want ryougi most
[4:25:22] <%ChoculaUltra> we prob might not get neco-arc as a character, but a neco-arc announcer dlc would be dope
[4:25:36] <nailwind> PogChamp
[4:25:38] <black_mages_matter_> i would totally buy neco arc announcer

[4:30:12] <+Inknail> this game is great
[4:30:16] <black_mages_matter_> yeah i was lukewarm on it because i kept getting rapid beat, but i cleaned my inputs and its pretty great
[4:30:20] <dds333a> DP fishing Kappa
[4:30:25] <zenith0111> I wish they had a bath house stage
[4:30:32] <DedlokPM> @badguy8312 it's from that show he hosted where they would have story vignettes and then you would have to guess whether it was a true story or one their writers made up. woolieFABRICATION

[4:30:41] <badguy8312> ahh, was kinda hoping it was about how he gets into chairs but that's cool too @choculaultra
[4:30:44] <black_mages_matter_> actually made me better at combos in current code because my inputs got so much cleaner avoiding rapid beat
[4:30:58] <phatmac16> DUNKU
[4:31:19] <+Inknail> @black_mages_matter_ yeah, I'm starting to clean up, but I'm still pretty bad tbh
[4:31:23] <badguy8312> @probably_facetious this is a CANADIAN broadcast, thank you

[4:32:18] <+Inknail> Reggie's been doing missions for sure lol
[4:32:25] <+Reverend_Roscoe> yo that was rad
[4:32:34] <black_mages_matter_> @black_mages_matter_ just takes practice, i used to double hit everything in UNI, BBCF and strive. ciel's recommended combo in the melty discord helped me a ton especially, its just hard enough to make me really think about my inputs but not insurmountable
[4:32:49] <lancerofgram> still relatively new to fighting games, but huge TM fan so been trying to learn Shiki
[4:32:57] <dds333a> about to spend
[4:33:09] <%ChoculaUltra> as a sloppy inputter/shameless panic masher the rapid beat helps turn fuck ups into magic LUL
[4:33:09] <zenith0111> Secret Discord Tech
[4:33:22] <phatmac16> @dds333a Shiki is a good character to start with
[4:33:26] <+Inknail> Ciel's 236C is one of the best EXs, period
[4:33:37] <dds333a> LUL
[4:33:40] <%ggbhtg> Universal Level 3s are fireball plus B and C, & Level 4s are all 4 attack buttons.
[4:33:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:33:43] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @choculaultra sounds like a game for me LUL
[4:33:55] <beatie_g> so does this game have drip? VoteYea VoteNay
[4:33:56] <alphalejandro> Well, Shiki's the "Ryu" of the game after all, so
[4:34:04] <+dankdirtydan> any kouma mains in chat?
[4:34:07] <+leviting> can you chip kill in this game?
[4:34:08] <zenith0111> @beatie_g Custom Colors so Yes
[4:34:09] <dds333a> @beatie_g the previous ones did so yeah
[4:34:16] <+dankdirtydan> @leviting i don't think so
[4:34:16] <Laliloluhla> Shiki's the Nanaya of this game
[4:34:20] <dds333a> @dankdirtydan yessir, shit as he was
[4:34:22] <phatmac16> @beatie_g you can make your own drip
[4:34:24] <%probably_facetious> @beatie_g Custom colors are sick, yea.
[4:34:43] <lancerofgram> I wanna learn Ciel, since she's tied with Arc as my favorite Tsukihime girl, but my monkey brain shuts off at her gameplay. lol
[4:34:43] <phatmac16> lol
[4:34:43] <beatie_g> customs are cheating I'm talkin' default colors
[4:34:45] <+dankdirtydan> @dds333a oh no is he bad? KEKW guess i picked the wrong person to learn lmao
[4:34:45] <black_mages_matter_> LUL
[4:34:47] <+Inknail> grab that shit
[4:34:49] <%ggbhtg> TAKEN
[4:34:51] <DaKnightWarrior> YOU THOUGHT
[4:34:51] <nailwind> stare into his eyes
[4:34:54] <zenith0111> LUL
[4:34:58] <Twistedoldham> Thats a good ass throw animation
[4:34:58] <dds333a> Kouma was LEGENDARILY bad, yeah LUL
[4:34:58] <%probably_facetious> @beatie_g You're wrong
[4:34:58] <%snakemanmcgoo> thts tht shit
[4:35:00] <zenith0111> Reggie please
[4:35:14] <+captain_history> I find Kouma pretty decent in this game
[4:35:20] <dds333a> I don't know what he's like here, I'm curious
[4:35:22] <+Inknail> Kouma got crazy buffed for this game
[4:35:36] <+dankdirtydan> @dds333a is he still bad in the new game as far as you can tell?
[4:35:48] <dds333a> this is my first look at the game, I dunni
[4:35:54] <nailwind> no one feels bad in this game
[4:35:59] <phatmac16> he's a grappling monster
[4:36:02] <+Inknail> @dds333a I feel like he's been waaaay improved with how much armor he has on some moves
[4:36:03] <+dankdirtydan> I hope so, pot got so much love in strive i was hoping grapplers were back on the rise
[4:36:06] <zenith0111> Called out the air fireball
[4:36:26] <TacoBomber> Kouma's armor helps a lot, as does being able to parry -> B teleport behind anyone trying to zone you out excessively
[4:36:31] <Laliloluhla> Kouma is definitely a good character now, people are also just discovering his new grab combos
[4:36:33] <dds333a> @inknail okay, okay I'm starting to like what I'm hearing LUL
[4:36:36] <+captain_history> Kouma is much better in this game yeah
[4:36:41] <Laliloluhla> which will up his damage even more
[4:36:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, have you looked at Ciel's custom colors at all?
[4:36:52] <+Inknail> @dankdirtydan he's not the same of Pot, but for this game's cast, he's totally the grappler main
[4:37:00] <+Inknail> as*
[4:37:14] <TacoBomber> Kouma can also use his grabs in the middle combos to get a hard knockdown and start the mixups
[4:37:29] <+Inknail> Hoping they eventually put Sacchin in this game so we have more grappler threats
[4:37:39] <+dankdirtydan> @dankdirtydan oh for sure, his grabs do waaaay less damage, but his rekka is cool and i like how you can end his combos in his grab kinda like heat knuckle
[4:37:54] <Laliloluhla> he can also combo off of some grabs
[4:37:55] <black_mages_matter_> @dankdirtydan hes more like a sol type grappler, he plays similarly to everyone else but has command grabs
[4:38:01] <+captain_history> I think I saw a datamine picture that had 4 spaces for new characters?
[4:38:05] <%aloofpenguin> Cheer1000 It has been absolutely bizarre watching this series evolve from a couple of light novels people would chat about on forms to having theatrically released movies and a gatcha empire.
[4:38:22] <+Inknail> @captain_history RyuChamp
[4:38:29] <%ChoculaUltra> we need a Notes remake
[4:38:29] <phatmac16> @Inknail gotta wait a long time for her since she's got a route now for the next tsukihime game
[4:38:30] <+KillerFlow> KillerFlow subscribed with Prime. 
[4:38:30] <black_mages_matter_> @dankdirtydan i think he cant gatling air moves into each other too, so he ends all combos in jc air throw
[4:38:46] <alphalejandro> @Inknail Punchy vamp girl?, yeah, that would be cool, alongside Aoko too
[4:38:54] <dds333a> @black_mages_matter_ is it better than not having air combos at all LUL
[4:38:59] <phatmac16> Nasu said red garden will come out for the next olympics so 4-5 years from now for sacchin
[4:39:06] <Laliloluhla> He can do air combos thanks to moon skills
[4:39:12] <Laliloluhla> they're not long but it's something
[4:39:20] <black_mages_matter_> @dds333a heavenly potempkin buster is the best air combo
[4:39:22] <+Inknail> they can let French Bread get her early surely
[4:39:26] <dds333a> Great. H Kouma had no air game whatsoever
[4:39:30] <+Inknail> THE PILE BUNKER
[4:39:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYEYE

[4:39:49] <black_mages_matter_> LUL
[4:39:52] <nailwind> THERE WE GO
[4:39:52] <%ChoculaUltra> he did it!
[4:39:52] <Laliloluhla> Oooooooo
[4:39:53] <black_mages_matter_> OUR BOY
[4:39:54] <+Inknail> Reggie does the thing
[4:39:55] <phatmac16> YEYEYEYE
[4:39:55] <dds333a> OH SHIT
[4:39:56] <alphalejandro> OH LAST ARC!
[4:40:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie does it pog
[4:40:03] <phatmac16> MARBLE PHANTASM
[4:40:10] <+Inknail> he blocked that EX
[4:40:13] <+Inknail> wow
[4:40:14] <+leviting> the cube
[4:40:17] <+stepsicola> is this game related to fate? i know literally nothing abt melty blood/type moon
[4:40:18] <phatmac16> no?
[4:40:21] <Laliloluhla> what?
[4:40:21] <+chase959> who is who?
[4:40:22] <phatmac16> it's only 4 bars
[4:40:23] <black_mages_matter_> no he had 4, you drop to 3 after you use it
[4:40:28] <+chase959> right side left side
[4:40:28] <TheFinalHazard> does last arc eat a bar?
[4:40:31] <+Inknail> he had to have 4
[4:40:31] <+leviting> @stepsicola its also typemoon
[4:40:32] <+captain_history> @stepsicola same universe
[4:40:33] <whirly25> wow, they really only have 2 faces
[4:40:34] <dds333a> @stepsicola think of it like its predecessor
[4:40:39] <%ChoculaUltra> you lose the bar after ye cast it
[4:40:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @stepsicola it's a seperate thing, but kinda the same universe
[4:40:53] <zenith0111> @stepsicola SMT/Persona kind of thing

[4:41:04] <+Inknail> They even have the Fate poster-child in this game
[4:41:06] <nailwind> biggest yomi

[4:41:14] <phatmac16> @stepsicola you can play as saber so its related to fate in that way
[4:41:15] <+demystify_fist> tsukihime and fate are not canon to each other but they each follow the same rules
[4:41:19] <+leviting> @stepsicola well, precursor I think
[4:41:24] <+captain_history> @stepsicola it's actually from before fate was a thing
[4:41:30] <+Inknail> So many Saber Alter pallettes online
[4:41:35] <%ChoculaUltra> not surprised it was Saber, but I totally could've seen them putting Emiya in.
[4:41:49] <phatmac16> they used to be together but Nasu split them up for lore reasons
[4:41:50] <+Inknail> Archer would be great (but Lancer would be best imo)
[4:42:01] <dds333a> @choculaultra totally would've expected EMIYA too
[4:42:03] <alphalejandro> @ChoculaUltra Emiya as Shirou or as Archer Emiya?
[4:42:11] <phatmac16> they probably have an archer prototype for the fate game they were making
[4:42:21] <+leviting> nah, put in the dad as the least tolerable zoner
[4:42:21] <+captain_history> @phatmac16 same universe still, just another timeline
[4:42:23] <%ChoculaUltra> oh I meant Emiya as Shirou lol, Nine Lives Bladeworks and allat cool shit
[4:42:23] <phatmac16> EMIYA, archer
[4:42:35] <%ChoculaUltra> but Archer Emiya would've been awesome too
[4:42:38] <+Inknail> @phatmac16 was French Bread making a fate game?
[4:42:51] <phatmac16> yeah they were or a type moon game
[4:42:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Is this gake bathroom tournament worthy?
[4:43:06] <phatmac16> that's where saber comes from but TM told them to make a melty game instead
[4:43:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> *game
[4:43:23] <zenith0111> Isnt there like only 2 good pieces of media from this franchise?
[4:43:27] <%WeepyDevil> tsukihime game you mean
[4:43:29] <+Inknail> I mean, I'd be down for more French Bread games period
[4:43:43] <dds333a> @sonofthedeepsouth from what I've heard and seen, they've gotten OUT of the bathroom
[4:43:44] <phatmac16> @zenith0111 nah melty games are generally good
[4:43:48] <phatmac16> besides the first one
[4:44:01] <%ChoculaUltra> hoping the Melty sales are enough of a push for an official Western release of the Tsukihime remake FeelsBadMan
[4:44:04] <+Inknail> almost, woolie
[4:44:04] <+captain_history> it's funny because Under Night In-Birth exists because Nasu told French Bread to create their own franchise
[4:44:12] <+TopTieramisu> they'd make mad bank just make a fate version of melty blood
[4:44:12] <%WeepyDevil> @zenith0111 i mean if you like f/go or fate/extra or whatever than i'll judge, but there's worse shit out there
[4:44:36] <phatmac16> @ChoculaUltra it sold around 100-200k on steam which is higher than FB's other games
[4:44:40] <+TopTieramisu> making*
[4:44:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @zenith0111 fgo is legit good though, story wise, but the damn gacha...
[4:44:52] <PenGia> f/go is fine past the first few chapters
[4:44:59] <phatmac16> you don't have to care about FGO for this game
[4:45:01] <+captain_history> @zenith0111 not really? it's super popular for a reason
[4:45:03] <dds333a> damn
[4:45:03] <Laliloluhla> Command grab!
[4:45:09] <phatmac16> just play the fihting game none of that other fate stuff matters
[4:45:11] <%WeepyDevil> @zenith0111 f/sn and tsukihime were made as h-games because Nasu needed the money, but you can bassically ignore that
[4:45:13] <phatmac16> fighting*
[4:45:20] <+Inknail> Ciel's 6C is a hitgrab in this game
[4:45:25] <beatie_g> that's a pretty nice reversal you guys got on your characters
[4:45:28] <phatmac16> and the new remake Tsukihime game doesn't have H scenes
[4:45:31] <zenith0111> @weepydevil tbf what manga artist hasn't
[4:45:33] <+captain_history> Tsukihime isn't even a h-game anymore, the remake got rid of all of that
[4:45:34] <%WeepyDevil> if you can enjoy VNs and anime shit than they're pretty good
[4:45:39] <black_mages_matter_> @phatmac16 i know :(
[4:45:43] <beatie_g> would be a shame if one of you got cocky on wake up and you happen to have it ready Kappa
[4:45:57] <dds333a> @zenith0111 Araki, as far as we know Kappa
[4:45:58] <zenith0111> Seems like most mangakas start in H novels
[4:46:01] <+Inknail> OOOO
[4:46:01] <beatie_g> BRUH
[4:46:02] <phatmac16> you can teleport with shield and B
[4:46:04] <%WeepyDevil> and there's the uftable anime adaptations for people who don't want to read a VN
[4:46:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man, more games should let you make custom color palettes that shit's fire
[4:46:05] <+Inknail> ballsy
[4:46:09] <beatie_g> DOUBLE BRUH
[4:46:30] <%ChoculaUltra> Boichi started off doing some dank h-manga, now Dr. Stone is like in the top 10 in Shounen Jump LUL
[4:46:38] <dds333a> damn, that shield stuff is intense
[4:46:43] <@SoushinSen> melty blood still got good music
[4:46:43] <+Inknail> there's that shield counter chain
[4:46:47] <phatmac16> shieldy blood
[4:46:49] <%WeepyDevil> now you can just watch ubw and heaven's feel, then f/z, and tsukihime
[4:46:58] <nailwind> we need a map change for a new beat
[4:46:58] <phatmac16> yeah hope they change stages for more music
[4:46:59] <+Inknail> @SoushinSen Raito don't miss
[4:47:09] <phatmac16> @WeepyDevil there is no tsukihime anime
[4:47:12] <LilRamza> @ChoculaUltra Sun-ken rock shibuy4Darkness
[4:47:13] <+captain_history> raito is great
[4:47:18] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> majinoNeko majinoPokimane
[4:47:19] <+Inknail> French Bread+Raito's music is great
[4:47:19] <beatie_g> run up grab? NOT respect
[4:47:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ft 100 let's gooooooo
[4:47:34] <SirDogBear> there is a tsukihime anime, it was canned Carnival Phantasm LUL
[4:47:36] <%WeepyDevil> i thought a ufotable version of nu tsukihime was coming out
[4:47:47] <phatmac16> hasn't been confirmed yet
[4:47:52] <phatmac16> they just made the intro for the VN
[4:47:54] <+Inknail> @WeepyDevil they made some animations for the new game, I think
[4:47:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[4:48:06] <%WeepyDevil> and kara no kyoukai was always good, even if its is the most up its own ass of any nasu shit...and has the dubious honour of the worst male protag
[4:48:07] <nailwind> PogChamp
[4:48:12] <%ChoculaUltra> I think ufotable is doing Demon Slayer for the rest of their lives
[4:48:13] <dds333a> the reset
[4:48:17] <black_mages_matter_> that was pretty awesome lmao
[4:48:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo i got a room until we hunt woolie and reggie
[4:48:24] <phatmac16> ufo will be busy with KNY so it will take a while
[4:48:26] <+Inknail> @WeepyDevil the dumbest of dumb male protags
[4:48:30] <zenith0111> Expose this man!
[4:48:31] <%WeepyDevil> even if you;re like me, and don't really care for shiki or shiro, at least they have cool powers n shit
[4:48:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ChoculaUltra that said, they did do a tales of zestiria anime once, so a tales of arise anime would be nice
[4:48:51] <lancerofgram> i like Mikiya though
[4:48:53] <+captain_history> kny is not that long though
[4:48:58] <%WeepyDevil> whatshisface from kara no kyoukai is just an idiot nice guy
[4:49:01] <shotgang86> burn your WHAT?
[4:49:11] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo a Tales of Arise anime would be kiiiiinda dope
[4:49:16] <dds333a> @shotgang86 learn the lore Kappa
[4:49:25] <lancerofgram> He's kinda meant to be normal, given his origin is normalcy/pacifism
[4:49:30] <%BisoromiBear> I just want Touko and her suitcase UMA
[4:49:34] <phatmac16> PILBUNKERRR
[4:49:37] <Laliloluhla> can't block ground moves in the air
[4:49:41] <Laliloluhla> including supers
[4:49:48] <+Inknail> no blocking grounded moves in air
[4:49:53] <black_mages_matter_> have to shield ground hits in the air
[4:49:56] <+Inknail> what Lali said
[4:49:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie loves the butter
[4:49:59] <black_mages_matter_> i think you can block projectiles in the air though
[4:50:07] <lancerofgram> Shirou and Kirei are still my favorite Nasuverse protag/antag dynamic though
[4:50:12] <zenith0111> Reggie is a meter horder
[4:50:12] <Laliloluhla> yeah you can block projectiles
[4:50:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @lancerofgram I like him for being the weirdly normal guy in a really weird scenario (and I guess being into girls that'll kill him). Also, props for him avoiding his brocon sister
[4:50:48] <%ChoculaUltra> I totally bought the Vlov announcer dlc cuz of the Kaiba vibes
[4:50:57] <+Inknail> man I'm learning stuff about Arc that I never noticed about her moves before
[4:51:25] <dds333a> woah
[4:51:27] <+leviting> kokutou works well as a baseline to show how deranged the rest of the gang is
[4:51:35] <zenith0111> These Reggie Resets
[4:51:44] <lancerofgram> @th3smartalec Yeah, he's just sorta meant to be the everyman who gets pulled into the weird world of KnK
[4:52:06] <shotgang86> man this game is pretty
[4:52:09] <beatie_g> cleeeaaaan shield overhead
[4:52:10] <+Inknail> shield chains are nuts here
[4:52:13] <dds333a> yo, that shield shit is hyps
[4:52:16] <shotgang86> animations are on point, hit feedback too
[4:52:17] <+captain_history> kokuto whole thing is being the normal guy who is attracted to the abnormal thing
[4:52:18] <%ChoculaUltra> shield chains are so damn hype
[4:52:24] <shotgang86> sfx, everything looks and sounds nice
[4:52:40] <+Inknail> I'm surprised Reggie doesn't throw out more ballsy charged Cs
[4:52:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> deffo excited for the future of this game
[4:53:00] <%WeepyDevil> yeah idgaf about that he's a NICE GUY and bassically an outright stalker
[4:53:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOO
[4:53:14] <nailwind> wish we had red sprouted memories on SourPls
[4:53:24] <dds333a> wow still caught him
[4:53:43] <brunoberserk> you cant shield the POWER OF JESUS
[4:53:43] <dds333a> this is all learning for me LUL
[4:53:48] <%WeepyDevil> yeah my big easy to fix complaint about type lumina
[4:53:59] <+Inknail> woolie burns that meter hard
[4:54:07] <%WeepyDevil> seperate music selection from stage selection
[4:54:20] <%WeepyDevil> not even asking for them to put old songs in
[4:54:26] <dds333a> PowerUpR
[4:54:28] <+Inknail> that move is so coool
[4:54:30] <phatmac16> PILEEEBUNKERRRR
[4:54:35] <phatmac16> but no more tats
[4:54:35] <+captain_history> powered ciel when?
[4:54:37] <alphalejandro> the game have 14 characters, are they gonna stick only to Ciel and Arcueid?
[4:54:40] <Laliloluhla> AKA Use your meter Reggie
[4:54:41] <nailwind> the angry arc pose gets me everytime
[4:54:53] <phatmac16> powerd Ciel would be crazy for the next game
[4:54:54] <zenith0111> Burn that meter reg
[4:54:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:54:55] <+Inknail> @alphalejandro when it became FOR GLORY, maybe
[4:55:16] <Laliloluhla> Yo invincible dp beats heat
[4:55:16] <phatmac16> she's got her monster hunter sword and guns
[4:55:21] <SirDogBear> Raw PogChamp
[4:55:22] <%Darmanimon> CappuccinoGuil thanks for the gift sub!
[4:55:24] <VideoEdditor> HypeRIP
[4:55:31] <+Inknail> you can also shield-counter heat burst
[4:55:34] <dds333a> @alphalejandro they're PLAYING playing LUL
[4:55:47] <+captain_history> yeah after remake, powered ciel would be even crazier in this game
[4:55:55] <alphalejandro> @dds333a Yeah i know, but still
[4:56:06] <lancerofgram> I kinda hope if we get dlc, we get a music pack with Shiki's new theme from the VN remake.
[4:56:09] <nailwind> PogChamp
[4:56:12] <SirDogBear> That was nice exchange PogChamp
[4:56:13] <+Inknail> Ciel's Last Arc is also crazy in this game
[4:56:20] <zepelinnn1> i was alt tabbed, is the audio scuffed?
[4:56:26] <zepelinnn1> game audio i mean
[4:56:32] <+Inknail> sounds good to me?
[4:56:35] <%ChoculaUltra> define scuffed
[4:56:35] <phatmac16> @lancerofgram that'd be sick, like with Ryougji getting an arragnement of her theme in melty
[4:56:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I've been playing so much strive that a game with normal damage feels weird now, oof
[4:56:46] <%ekodrop> nah sudio is good
[4:56:50] <zepelinnn1> prob me then, sounds muffled on my end
[4:56:53] <+Inknail> @lancerofgram I want a return of that stage tbh
[4:57:02] <dds333a> dunked
[4:57:07] <+kamig92> sounds muffled for me too
[4:57:08] <%ChoculaUltra> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ dude I freak out that matches aren't over in 15 seconds LUL
[4:57:10] <black_mages_matter_> nah i noticed it sounded underwater at first too, but my ears got used to it
[4:57:15] <+kamig92> just game sound
[4:57:23] <black_mages_matter_> yeah woolie and reggie sound fine
[4:57:30] <phatmac16> yeah sound isn't great for me but whatever
[4:57:39] <TheFinalHazard> woolie and reggie sound fine but the game sounds like it's coming through their mics instead of direct audio
[4:57:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ChoculaUltra man, woolie does the pilebunker and every time I'm like "wait...this didn't do 70% health" it's wild
[4:57:44] <phatmac16> the game is pretty loud for them so whatever makes theme comfortable
[4:57:54] <+itsmonktastic> reggie's looking clean
[4:57:55] <zenith0111> Whats the lore on Arc
[4:57:58] <nailwind> i actually dont mind the muffle, separates the audio better
[4:58:12] <black_mages_matter_> @zenith0111 shes an 800 year old virgin
[4:58:15] <+leviting> @zenith0111 she's the tsuki hime. vampire princess stuff
[4:58:19] <lancerofgram> I was also entertaining the idea of what if we get a dlc rep from the main TM works. Like for Mahoyo we could get Soujourou, Ryougi from KnK, etc
[4:58:19] <phatmac16> @zenith0111 original vampire girl that's cute
[4:58:22] <%SlangPunk> Is this that new restroom game?
[4:58:25] <+captain_history> @zenith0111 ultimate being fairy vampire
[4:58:36] <%ChoculaUltra> get in, we're doing first to 20s in the back stall
[4:58:39] <+Inknail> @zenith0111 she's a vampire princess from the moon. Vampires in Nasu canon are also a lot crazier than you'd think
[4:58:50] <OldManDeckardCain> arc is the true ancestor, in other words she is from Africa Kappa
[4:58:52] <%WeepyDevil> @zenith0111 the first vampire was the moon cau, she's the first vampires kid
[4:58:57] <phatmac16> it's just like Vampire Hunter D
[4:58:58] <TacoBomber> arc is an old vampire with the power to be a fighting game character utilizing the power of Proper Nouns
[4:59:00] <zenith0111> I was also about to ask about the lack of fangs
[4:59:09] <zenith0111> but the moon amswers that and more
[4:59:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @OldManDeckardCain she has the ancestral crown to proove it
[4:59:20] <nailwind> @zenith0111 hunts other ridiculously powerful vampires
[4:59:24] <Zeif00> SourPls
[4:59:27] <%WeepyDevil> vlov and roa are also "vampires"
[4:59:33] <+captain_history> @zenith0111 she actually has fangs if she wants
[4:59:34] <%WeepyDevil> so was nero
[4:59:36] <+Inknail> Ciel's lore is even nuttier imo
[4:59:36] <SirDogBear> she also has a weakness against knives LUL
[4:59:39] <+leviting> something something dead apostles
[4:59:40] <phatmac16> well Vlov is a classic vampire
[4:59:43] <phatmac16> gothic and all
[4:59:44] <dds333a> not to mention that the other notable Tsukihime vamp, Wallachia, isn't even a vampire, he's just a metaphysical entity
[4:59:44] <%ChoculaUltra> Nero FeelsBadMan
[4:59:47] <alphalejandro> Ask for lore to only get jokes & memes
[4:59:49] <zenith0111> @sirdogbear why
[4:59:51] <phatmac16> F to Nero
[4:59:52] <beatie_g> I can't believe Arc really is just a granny who looks young and has super powers
[4:59:52] <+Inknail> @WeepyDevil oh, do you mean NrvnqsrotwidhanddaggfgsfH?
[5:00:01] <lancerofgram> Ciel also got a huge glow up to her route in the remake
[5:00:01] <black_mages_matter_> @alphalejandro hey what i said was true
[5:00:02] <zenith0111> @dds333a I see
[5:00:06] <SirDogBear> well its not knives alone, knives with mystic eyes of death perception LUL
[5:00:09] <%ChoculaUltra> Nero Cows
[5:00:16] <phatmac16> yeah Ciel is amazing in the remake
[5:00:19] <%WeepyDevil> the knives thing is a joke lol
[5:00:24] <zenith0111> @sirdogbear what
[5:00:32] <+Inknail> That super never gets old lol
[5:00:46] <phatmac16> I want Woolie to do her level 4
[5:00:51] <dds333a> yo, the staredown LUL
[5:00:52] <black_mages_matter_> yeah shiki can kill anyone with his finger nails
[5:00:55] <shotgang86> LUL
[5:00:55] <+Inknail> Reggie fishing for that last arc
[5:00:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie pls Kappa
[5:01:01] <beatie_g> you get NO butter for your popcorn
[5:01:02] <zenith0111> LUL
[5:01:04] <TheFinalHazard> magic circuit = unburnt
[5:01:05] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie wants to be flashy with it
[5:01:06] <+itsmonktastic> if reggie starts usin that meter omg
[5:01:09] <%WeepyDevil> its more like "weak to eyes that let you see and apply the death to all things" and shiki just happened to do it with a knife
[5:01:22] <+BubbaRands> all butter no bread
[5:01:26] <+Inknail> reggie needs to release the limiters on that meter
[5:01:26] <SirDogBear> shiki got the power of the mystic eyes of death perception which is why he wears the glasses @zenith0111 ... lets say thats how he and Arc meet LUL
[5:01:29] <KreuzDrache> how do you decide when to use meter vs when to use it?
[5:01:35] <phatmac16> well Shiki just sees the truth of the world and that its dying all the time
[5:01:35] <lancerofgram> I mean, Shiki can only kill things he can perceive the death of tbf, his eyes also fry his brain if he overuses them
[5:01:36] <KreuzDrache> vs when to save it*
[5:01:48] <+BottledLineArt> @WeepyDevil ....what....
[5:01:50] <Laliloluhla> yeah that's a little annoying
[5:01:52] <%BisoromiBear> Shiki > Shiki
[5:01:52] <zenith0111> @sirdogbear Kreygasm or WutFace ?
[5:01:53] <%WeepyDevil> since you can cut with bassically anything, like, say, a book, or a headbutt, shiki could presumabley go maximum kill with them
[5:01:55] <phatmac16> and that the world is fragile like glass...a glass moon
[5:01:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:02:12] <%ChoculaUltra> oh I get it, glass moon
[5:02:13] <%WeepyDevil> its not like "essence of murder" is that wierd a power
[5:02:18] <%ChoculaUltra> they said the thing
[5:02:18] <SirDogBear> tsukhime worth playing so when the remake VN comes out I would say its worth a play @zenith0111 if it werent for that I would totally spoil everything right now LUL
[5:02:19] <Laliloluhla> Shiki can cut anything as long as he has a sharp object, even paper
[5:02:25] <zenith0111> @weepydevil Wtf lol
[5:02:26] <Laliloluhla> he can paper cut things to death
[5:02:26] <%WeepyDevil> its relatively common as far as conceptual powers in fiction go
[5:02:46] <dds333a> LUL
[5:02:47] <lancerofgram> Ryougi from KnK is stronger than Tohno in Tsukihime for a couple reasons, a big one being her eyes don't turn her brain to mush
[5:02:49] <+Inknail> eyes of death perception can be extrapolated out to some crazy stuff. So long as you can "perceive" something, you can kill it. Without limits.
[5:02:52] <phatmac16> Sheildy Blood
[5:02:55] <brunoberserk> i like that in the lore , shiki is biggest glass cannon ever
[5:03:01] <%WeepyDevil> he is
[5:03:02] <zenith0111> So he has like a the ultimate kill knife
[5:03:15] <+Inknail> Ryougi shiki killed a bacterial infection with her knife
[5:03:16] <2deep5u> shield tech is like 4D chess
[5:03:17] <SirDogBear> and don't worry because its nasu there gonna be like pages of pages of character talking about world building lore and background LUL
[5:03:18] <dds333a> @brunoberserk indeed LUL
[5:03:19] <Laliloluhla> It's just a regular switchblade but he makes it a kill knife
[5:03:20] <phatmac16> nah it's just a normal knife
[5:03:27] <%WeepyDevil> he's just a normal human (well, he's from a special clan, but whatever)
[5:03:33] <zenith0111> So he super kills you
[5:03:40] <phatmac16> yup
[5:03:40] <black_mages_matter_> @Inknail she killed an apartment building with her finger nail
[5:03:41] <SirDogBear> thats why Fate Stay Night got the whole stats thing, good old Nasu LUL
[5:03:41] <dds333a> Shiki can get instantly misted by a stray hit
[5:03:41] <%WeepyDevil> he can kill anything but anything could kill him
[5:03:47] <Laliloluhla> he can erase you from existence
[5:03:48] <lancerofgram> eh, regular knife thats also a family heirloom tbf
[5:03:52] <Laliloluhla> he can cut concepts
[5:03:53] <alphalejandro> This Reggie's fault, we could have a FOR FUN play session and have them play the other characters, but no, Reggie had to start with his BS don't him
[5:03:53] <zenith0111> @weepydevil Fair?
[5:03:55] <alephalpha> notable things meodp have killed the future, vampirism, space, a thought, localised nature. a soul
[5:04:04] <phatmac16> he super kills the infinite reincarnator Roa
[5:04:11] <2deep5u> shiki doesn't even need a sharp object, he literally destroys his bed in the prologue by tracing the lines of his hospital bed with his fingers
[5:04:14] <brunoberserk> dont even  need to be a knife , he cant do with the hands too
[5:04:17] <nailwind> the Reggie FOR GLORY sabotage, first in history
[5:04:29] <dds333a> @nailwind LUL
[5:04:31] <zenith0111> The knifes there to be extra gotcha
[5:04:33] <+leviting> cut to ryougi killing in apendicitis off camera
[5:04:34] <alephalpha> shiki ryougu killing afuture is sitll the msot bastract thing we've sene kille
[5:04:35] <TacoBomber> if you want to get into Nasustuff, keep in mind that they're generally kind of stupid about Proper Noun Primacy
[5:04:37] <phatmac16> @alphalejandro just let them have fun with the game
[5:04:44] <black_mages_matter_> @zenith0111 its his family's knife
[5:04:47] <lancerofgram> "Its time I showed you what real death feels like, vampire" - Shiki Tohno to Roa when he's tired of Roa's BS
[5:04:53] <zenith0111> My familys switchblade?
[5:04:55] <+Inknail> we could have had a friendly game of melty, but Reggie had to break out the real shit
[5:04:59] <TacoBomber> The stories can be really good (or really bad), but the fandom can get really up its own ass about Proper Noun Wars
[5:05:00] <%WeepyDevil> shiki gets hyped up for being a protag, but there's plenty of stupid insane nonsense powers in nasushit
[5:05:16] <phatmac16> @lancerofgram that moment in the remake is so good
[5:05:20] <SirDogBear> yea shiki comes from a family of demon slayers i believe which also explains his first encounter with arc
[5:05:28] <Laliloluhla> Also his powers literally kill him too
[5:05:31] <+Inknail> Reggie needs to burn his magic circuit
[5:05:33] <Laliloluhla> and make him crazy
[5:05:42] <alphalejandro> @alphalejandro And that's fine, i just wanted to see them try the other characters, that's all
[5:05:45] <%WeepyDevil> like the vampire wizard whose power is "nebulous amount of free access to the entire multiverse", who killed the moon
[5:05:48] <phatmac16> yeah his Nanaya/demon hunting blood
[5:05:58] <zenith0111> I see the H-Novel elements @laliloluhla
[5:06:01] <nailwind> Nanaya fucking slaps, doesnt need death eyes to mincemeat anything
[5:06:01] <lancerofgram> I mean, one of the cool things about TM protags is they're usually not the strongest in their respective stories barring Ryougi in KnK
[5:06:05] <dds333a> @sirdogbear not to mention said family is all but extinct
[5:06:16] <alephalpha> zeltretch also dcides which timelines is real in fate strage/fake
[5:06:19] <Laliloluhla> oh yeah, the moon is a vampire
[5:06:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> so can you use shield as many times as you want in a match?
[5:06:26] <zenith0111> @laliloluhla stfu
[5:06:30] <phatmac16> the crimson moon who is a sentient celestial being that is also a vampire
[5:06:31] <SirDogBear> yea that prologue with the music @dds333a BibleThump
[5:06:31] <alephalpha> the greek gods were also alien mechas
[5:06:38] <+Inknail> Ciel's is pretty much unkillable due to a programming error in the rules of the universe, so she's pretty busted in a way too
[5:06:38] <brunoberserk> and Kishima Kouma is basically Akuma in the lore
[5:06:43] <zenith0111> what does that mean
[5:06:53] <alephalpha> which thing zenith?
[5:06:59] <zenith0111> Moon vampire
[5:07:01] <phatmac16> that's why we don't talk about the moon
[5:07:02] <+demystify_fist> @CaptainPileDriver shield is unlimited. however, using it drains your moon meter, and if your moon is low enough it gets worse
[5:07:08] <+MTLxSpider> in game audio kinda scuffed or just me
[5:07:12] <+leviting> wait is ciel just slayer's wife from guilty gear
[5:07:14] <+MTLxSpider> sorry jsut got here
[5:07:15] <Laliloluhla> Basically the moon is a vampire and vampires came to earth to punish humans for being anti-environmental
[5:07:22] <Laliloluhla> the moon is a dick
[5:07:23] <KreuzDrache> it seems just an issue on your end?
[5:07:25] <zenith0111> Yo what
[5:07:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @MTLxSpider try reloading the site
[5:07:27] <lancerofgram> Ciel I think according to remake is the strongest "human" in the Nasuverse too
[5:07:30] <nailwind> LUL moon protesting humanity
[5:07:30] <+MTLxSpider> kk
[5:07:31] <dds333a> @leviting Sharon? LUL
[5:07:31] <KreuzDrache> music seems to be pllaying fine on my end
[5:07:43] <alephalpha> ok so you see typ-moon/crimson moon is the proto vampire and is basically the world soulr epresntation fo the moon and gaea created a rce of proctetors absed on it which are the true ancestors like arc
[5:07:43] <+Inknail> @Laliloluhla The Earth called the moon over to fuck up humans though too
[5:07:45] <%WeepyDevil> all planets have incarnations/sentience in nasu
[5:07:51] <alphalejandro> @lancerofgram and Inmortal
[5:07:54] <@Menitta> remember when the moon got cursed a while back
[5:07:57] <+leviting> @dds333a yeah with the whole not ever actually dying thing
[5:07:59] <Laliloluhla> oh the earth asked for it? My mistake then
[5:08:04] <%WeepyDevil> gaia hates humans and wants us to die
[5:08:06] <zenith0111> Whats the Earth got to say about? @weepydevil
[5:08:08] <brunoberserk> we dont talk about the MOON
[5:08:10] <zenith0111> oh
[5:08:12] <alephalpha> then modern day dead apostles and dead apostle ancestors are the result of mages and othe rfuckers finding ways to become immortal and their soultrotting
[5:08:17] <+MTLxSpider> probably not me. their voice sound fine. but the game sounds underwater lol
[5:08:20] <dds333a> @leviting to an extent, yeah,
[5:08:22] <alephalpha> and then ghouls are basicallyt hir familairs
[5:08:24] <zenith0111> So humans are the villians
[5:08:26] <+Inknail> The Earth hates humans, but also has a failsafe to prevent their annihilation
[5:08:28] <phatmac16> yeah the game sounds underwater
[5:08:34] <ZippyPsycho> @MTLxSpider Having that same issue too
[5:08:40] <%WeepyDevil> yeah she has split personality disorder or soemthing
[5:08:44] <nailwind> Notes is a story where humanity literally battles planets
[5:08:50] <alphalejandro> Really Reggie, really?!
[5:08:55] <Laliloluhla> yeah there are basically 2 kinds of vampires, moon vampires and traditional vampires
[5:08:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:09:01] <+Inknail> Sound's fine on my end, I think?
[5:09:02] <+captain_history> @zenith0111 not really?
[5:09:05] <alephalpha> the thing is the teu ancesotr s got crazy bloodlust from crimson moon that was not a part of the paln and horrifically killed each toher and humans
[5:09:06] <lancerofgram> tldr: Gaia (earth) percieves humanity as a virus and asked Type-Moon (An Amcient one/vampire) to help get rid of us
[5:09:10] <alephalpha> arc is the onyl one lef
[5:09:15] <+itsmonktastic> nice
[5:09:15] <beatie_g> wow that punished?
[5:09:19] <alephalpha> tand the earth kidna of acts through her
[5:09:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> "what a scumbag" as he walked forward, used the power up, then tried to raw level 4
[5:09:30] <%WeepyDevil> and "vampires" which is like...half the so called Dead Apostle (vampire) Ancestors lol
[5:09:42] <+Inknail> just don't die with meter, reggie lol
[5:09:43] <lancerofgram> humanity's will created the counterforce to fight back basically
[5:09:52] <alephalpha> incidentally after the earth dies out in notes it's detah cries cause the other planets to send out their ultimate oens to kill tus
[5:09:53] <dds333a> I hope chat doesn't start getting further in to the Archetype debacle LUL
[5:10:00] <Laliloluhla> Yeah there's a big Humanity Fuck yeah them going on too
[5:10:01] <%WeepyDevil> they eat blood and are kind of undead, and are ridiculously powerful, so we shove them in the vampire ancestor box
[5:10:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NotLikeThis all this lore talk is gonna summon a wendigo into my room
[5:10:12] <alephalpha> but cause they are fucky typer mercury arrives hundreds of years in the apst an exists in the mdoern ansuvers
[5:10:15] <nailwind> LUL this chatroom is a fever dream
[5:10:26] <%BisoromiBear> and then there's ORT
[5:10:26] <@Menitta> All this lore and I'm just like "haha Arima go punch"
[5:10:30] <SirDogBear> the only lore you need to know is isn't it sad Sacchin BibleThump
[5:10:31] <%WeepyDevil> i can talk about i dunno, World of Darkness vampire lore if you prefer
[5:10:32] <phatmac16> that's what happens when woolie plays type moon games
[5:10:33] <alephalpha> eand it a giant crsytal spider that exists in south america waiting till human kill the erath toe radicate them all
[5:10:37] <nailwind> less lore and more TETSUZANKOU
[5:10:44] <phatmac16> arc is cute
[5:10:49] <alephalpha> sacchin is so sad :(
[5:10:51] <+Inknail> @SirDogBear it's sad that her dumb hitboxes aren't in this game yet!
[5:10:57] <+captain_history> this is cute, but if you want crazy lore that's D&D lore
[5:10:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the lore is roa does war crimes
[5:10:59] <phatmac16> miyako is a problem
[5:11:05] <%WeepyDevil> the Sabbat were right, fuck Cain, fuck the antideluvians, fuck the methusalahs
[5:11:10] <SirDogBear> damn strait, @Inknail  sacchin robbed again BibleThump
[5:11:11] <lancerofgram> I mean, as long as no one gets obnoxious I don't see the harm. TM lore is cool
[5:11:12] <@Menitta> I want a game where you gotta learn lore before looking at frame datas

[5:11:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Menitta LUL d&D
[5:11:43] <+MTLxSpider> probably a capture card thing
[5:11:43] <Laliloluhla> Roa is a fucking body snatcher
[5:11:45] <zenith0111> @menitta Gotta answer with a 95% accuracy on a 100 question quiz for training mode
[5:11:45] <+Inknail> REGGIE METER HIM
[5:11:47] <%WeepyDevil> dnd lore is really not that wild tbh
[5:11:54] <@Menitta> Actually that's Warhammer
[5:11:54] <StarkMaximum> "Am I alive? Yeah, I'm alive." -Reggie, last words.
[5:11:56] <+MTLxSpider> they just need to unplug replug maybe
[5:12:00] <%WeepyDevil> like, there's a lot of it, especially for forgotten realms
[5:12:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah, warhammer
[5:12:04] <@Menitta> Thats 100% warhammer LUL
[5:12:04] <+Inknail> NOT LIKE THAT
[5:12:12] <phatmac16> WOOLIE GAME SOUNDS BAD
[5:12:17] <+itsmonktastic> well he used the meter I guess XD
[5:12:20] <SirDogBear> reggie throwing out DPs like halloween candy PogChamp
[5:12:28] <+captain_history> @WeepyDevil Planescape and Spelljammer are quite wild though
[5:12:32] <dds333a> @weepydevil exactly, Forgotten Realms is where they go for it
[5:12:35] <+leviting> so now he starts spending the meter
[5:12:37] <nailwind> DP with wild abandon
[5:12:39] <+Inknail> damn they good
[5:12:42] <+itsmonktastic> ggs
[5:12:48] <zenith0111> warhammer lore sounds so dense because no even bothers even trying
[5:12:49] <%WeepyDevil> eh, not really
[5:12:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> for glory over? that's where for glory starts
[5:12:57] <nailwind> ciels movelist in mbaacc is a whole manual
[5:13:01] <SirDogBear> lore result between these two chars PogChamp
[5:13:05] <%WeepyDevil> afterlife shit and the fugue plane is fucked
[5:13:12] <%WeepyDevil> but its the fucking alignment frid lol
[5:13:13] <phatmac16> the game sound bad to anyone else?
[5:13:16] <lancerofgram> I do find it funny that Reggie and Woolie are playing Arc and Ciel given the rivalry and memes about it
[5:13:19] <Laliloluhla> you get more meter while you're in moon drive state too
[5:13:20] <dds333a> @sirdogbear LUL LUL
[5:13:20] <phatmac16> or stream?
[5:13:21] <%WeepyDevil> spelljammer is neat but there just isn't that much o it
[5:13:23] <alphalejandro> The planet Earth of the Nasuverse is like any comic book planet Earth, it's always in danger and it's always saved at the last second
[5:13:30] <SirDogBear> ciel always seems super powerful but i keep hearing ciel players saying her normals are more limiting than you would think LUL
[5:13:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> legit game sounds fine to me though
[5:13:38] <+itsmonktastic> game sounds fine to me
[5:13:47] <%WeepyDevil> i don't notice it myself yeah
[5:13:49] <beatie_g> this PS5?
[5:13:53] <+TECHNO_OUTLAW> TECHNO_OUTLAW subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! how many kites do you now own mister I'm not going to collect kites
[5:14:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Dang, I'm on PC guys, can't join :(
[5:14:07] <+Inknail> if I enter here, I'll get bodied.....
[5:14:11] <beatie_g> or ps4
[5:14:14] <phatmac16> alright I'll reset my stream
[5:14:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that ciel avatar is cute
[5:14:28] <TheFinalHazard> ps4 :(
[5:14:28] <alphalejandro> Oh Ciel avatar
[5:14:28] <phatmac16> oh boy miyako
[5:14:32] <brunoberserk> so still haven't read the remake ,that weapon Ciel uses in the last arc , is a new form of the Seventh Holy Scripture or is a new weapon?
[5:14:34] <dds333a> Arima time
[5:14:36] <zenith0111> Body him chat
[5:14:40] <badguy8312> so Pat just realized how long the party part of the Citadel DLC is...
[5:14:48] <nailwind> i was just about to pray for a Miyako player to appear
[5:14:48] <beatie_g> okay kill this guy
[5:14:48] <lancerofgram> Just a reminder: Roa and the Maids are cancer to fight
[5:14:52] <Laliloluhla> Kill this child
[5:14:53] <dds333a> @badguy8312 oh fukc LUL
[5:14:53] <+Inknail> k, time to get myself whooped
[5:14:57] <Garrison27> I got in for once!
[5:14:59] <beatie_g> keep him out cuz Miyako is a little monkey
[5:15:00] <@Menitta> there are 3 Miyako's in this lobby already
[5:15:05] <nailwind> smack his ass, wool
[5:15:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @badguy8312 we kept telling him but he didn't comprehend how big the dlc is lmao
[5:15:10] <zenith0111> Degen hours
[5:15:14] <zenith0111> AYAYAA
[5:15:15] <+Inknail> @Menitta I'm one, but I'm bad :(
[5:15:15] <Laliloluhla> wait you can do that?
[5:15:17] <lancerofgram> Miyako walks like a damn goblin
[5:15:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I really like miyako's playstyle but I don't vibe with the character sadly
[5:15:34] <nailwind> generations of miyako being low tier have come back to haunt us (except that one version she was busted)
[5:15:34] <badguy8312> @cobalt_phoenix_ worth every second tho
[5:15:37] <@Menitta> I have less than an hour on this game so I'm just gonna vibe lmao
[5:15:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @badguy8312 oh for sure
[5:15:43] <+captain_history> miyako the atom ant
[5:15:47] <dds333a> okay, so, Miyako is still pretty similar LUL
[5:15:55] <+Inknail> BOP
[5:15:57] <@Menitta> LUL This room has all the usual suspects of GIFG

[5:16:18] <+Inknail> @SirDogBear yeah, but rounds are fast
[5:16:21] <@Menitta> I already liked Miyako in the older MB
[5:16:22] <DedlokPM> rooAYAYA
[5:16:35] <alphalejandro> The Power of I WANT MY ONICHAN BACK is real
[5:16:41] <badguy8312> clean
[5:16:43] <nailwind> I wish we had mbaacc Miyako combos
[5:16:47] <zenith0111> Learn the MU scrub
[5:16:51] <+Reverend_Roscoe> miyakos punch is super cool
[5:16:53] <dds333a> Oh, shit almost got the kick
[5:17:04] <%WeepyDevil> yeah not worth it
[5:17:05] <+Inknail> bajiquan shit
[5:17:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LOOK AT THOSE MIYAKOS
[5:17:12] <SirDogBear> @Inknail k got it, maybe i get a chance to sneak in and be exposed LUL
[5:17:15] <phatmac16> Miyako is a problem
[5:17:16] <nailwind> green-haired miyako, great taste
[5:17:18] <+dakarplaugas> There is three of them
[5:17:21] <@Menitta> LISTEN ITS FINE
[5:17:21] <lancerofgram> Maybe its just me and being a noob, but isn't Miyako's throw kinda terrible?
[5:17:27] <badguy8312> time for BEEF BOY
[5:17:28] <+Inknail> @nailwind thank
[5:17:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> you will learn this matchup tonight
[5:17:34] <dds333a> okay  time for homework
[5:17:35] <nailwind> @lancerofgram she comboes from throw and everyone in this game spams shield, so its super good
[5:17:43] <brunoberserk> somebody is get DUUUUNKED
[5:17:43] <@Menitta> I tried making a Miyako color thats like Makoto
[5:17:46] <dds333a> I WANNA know everything about Kouma now
[5:17:47] <alphalejandro> @lancerofgram She's ToP Tier i think
[5:17:48] <Laliloluhla> wait that's a problem on PS too?
[5:17:51] <%ekodrop> i thought that was a pc issues
[5:17:51] <Laliloluhla> I thought it was only PC
[5:17:55] <Captbutt> not on console
[5:17:58] <+Inknail> I think the skip intro issues are mostly a pc thing
[5:18:00] <@Menitta> the color customization isnt as in depth as Id like
[5:18:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> true, that is a pc issue only it seems
[5:18:08] <Garrison27> Skipping intros is fine on console
[5:18:10] <badguy8312> is this guy like Enkidu from UNIST?
[5:18:12] <+Inknail> but best not to fuck around lol
[5:18:18] <@Menitta> Oh this dude is cool
[5:18:18] <+Inknail> @badguy8312 he's more grabby
[5:18:26] <+dakarplaugas> Yo
[5:18:27] <SirDogBear> oh wait, is this on steam or ps4?
[5:18:28] <dds333a> @badguy8312 he precedes him, and he plays differently
[5:18:32] <+dakarplaugas> Holy shit he cool
[5:18:33] <nailwind> Miyakos closer to Enkidu than Kouma tbh
[5:18:33] <DedlokPM> @SirDogBear ps4
[5:18:38] <dds333a> at least in previous games
[5:18:38] <+Inknail> oh man, in spectator, we can look at input history
[5:18:48] <+captain_history> kouma is rekka grab flame man
[5:18:52] <@Menitta> oh great everyone will see me mashing furiously
[5:18:57] <lancerofgram> tldr for Kouma: Demon Blood clan, branch family of Tohno, killed Shiki's og clan of demon hunters by himself
[5:19:00] <SirDogBear> @DedlokPM got it, oh okay i'll keep refreshing that room list then LUL
[5:19:04] <Laliloluhla> Oooof
[5:19:08] <zenith0111> @lancerofgram But why
[5:19:10] <+Inknail> @SirDogBear they're playing ps4
[5:19:22] <+Inknail> but the game is also on pc
[5:19:23] <badguy8312> @lancerofgram those are certainly a string of words
[5:19:23] <phatmac16> he's a damage gorilla
[5:19:24] <nailwind> @Menitta LUL this game will quickly discourage you from mashing with its autocombos
[5:19:29] <brunoberserk> UNGA
[5:19:30] <SirDogBear> got it thanks @Inknail
[5:19:33] <%Irridium> gg's
[5:19:33] <%WeepyDevil> kouma's fun
[5:19:43] <dds333a> @zenith0111 A member of the Tohno themselves ordered the slaughter LUL
[5:19:53] <SunsetJack> I think the last of the rekka (where he does the hop kick) is unsafe?
[5:20:00] <+dankdirtydan> i found that kouma's down Ex move works really well for an idiot like me haha
[5:20:03] <%ekodrop> don't worry bout skipping intro
[5:20:09] <+Inknail> @dankdirtydan BIG ARMOR
[5:20:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh no
[5:20:19] <@Menitta> Yeah I noticed that. I wish autocombos werent a thing anymore.
[5:20:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> everyone in the lobby, pass
[5:20:21] <@Menitta> Oh what
[5:20:35] <lancerofgram> @zenith0111 Shiki's adopted dad, original head of the Tohno clan had demon blood and wanted to get rid of the Nanaya clan who were demon hunters so he asked Kouma to kill them, which he did
[5:20:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> it auto rotates when you sit there
[5:20:38] <@Menitta> Didnt know how to pass
[5:20:44] <lancerofgram> the Tohno then adopted Shiki
[5:20:47] <nailwind> LUL
[5:20:50] <%Irridium> @SunsetJack super unsafe
[5:20:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[5:20:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hmmmm
[5:20:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> there we go
[5:20:56] <@Menitta> that was weird
[5:20:59] <nailwind> thatsa a lot of kites already
[5:21:02] <SunsetJack> Yeee
[5:21:08] <DedlokPM> SEVEN!?!
[5:21:12] <alphalejandro> Oh, cousins fight
[5:21:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta it's a lobby thing you can chenge
[5:21:14] <badguy8312> have to be good at backpedaling of you're into kites to be fair
[5:21:20] <phatmac16> canon match
[5:21:20] <Zeif00> The transformation is happening
[5:21:28] <nailwind> LUL the only thing i want in this game are better player banners like in UNIEL
[5:21:29] <phatmac16> onion rings
[5:21:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah, the raven
[5:21:38] <phatmac16> this song is so good
[5:21:41] <DaKnightWarrior> Jedah blades
[5:21:43] <badguy8312> carmine?
[5:21:46] <lancerofgram> The battle for oni-chan's attention, the match
[5:21:52] <@Menitta> man....now I kinda wanna change characters lmao
[5:21:54] <zenith0111> Whats Demon blood
[5:21:55] <Laliloluhla> Is that a joker miyako?
[5:21:57] <phatmac16> the battle for oni-chan
[5:21:58] <nailwind> oh wait it was uniclr now
[5:22:02] <+leviting> the real onion rings belong to red arc
[5:22:12] <@Menitta> I just liked the rush punches LUL
[5:22:15] <lancerofgram> the blood... of a demon
[5:22:16] <%WeepyDevil> @WoolieVersus reggie wants to be using the BC4 i think
[5:22:26] <nailwind> ELBOW
[5:22:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> watching this in the lobby i can see all the buttons being pressed
[5:22:30] <%WeepyDevil> uh, 4BC
[5:22:39] <nailwind> seeing someones input history is very intimate
[5:22:47] <%WeepyDevil> if he doesn't want to do perfect cancels
[5:22:49] <%Wool> oh yeah, spectators can see input history and see who mashes
[5:22:53] <zenith0111> @lancerofgram Do they just get stronger or like something?
[5:23:08] <+Inknail> and there I go lol
[5:23:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:23:20] <+Inknail> gg
[5:23:22] <dds333a> @inknail LUL
[5:23:24] <lancerofgram> Longevity, increased physical abilities,etc
[5:23:32] <lancerofgram> super human basically
[5:23:46] <beatie_g> ttbh just hold the button and be ready because people drop things semi often since we're all new
[5:23:48] <Laliloluhla> also forward tech has recovery
[5:23:53] <dds333a> @lancerofgram to an insane degree, as you said
[5:23:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> how did they hop in front of me?
[5:23:55] <Laliloluhla> it's not full invincible basically
[5:23:56] <nailwind> @Inknail majinoSeshun contributed to the cause
[5:24:05] <alphalejandro> Warc incoming
[5:24:09] <SirDogBear> akiha is cool, but i miss vakiha she was my main in older games BibleThump
[5:24:10] <brunoberserk> no saber yet , huh , is she low-tier ?
[5:24:12] <phatmac16> old akiha is way better
[5:24:16] <KalmVibrations> Rings vs Rings
[5:24:19] <OldManDeckardCain> cucked arc time LUL
[5:24:20] <Laliloluhla> Repub Arc?
[5:24:21] <phatmac16> long skirt best skirt
[5:24:23] <black_mages_matter_> shes the only person thats not mean to other girls for no reason in tsukihime
[5:24:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> that dash grab is ex only so
[5:24:31] <dds333a> @oldmandeckardcain LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:24:50] <Laliloluhla> jesus
[5:24:56] <phatmac16> she's sick
[5:24:57] <+Strahlenwaffeln> There is only so much HKD. 2C when the Enemy is on the Ground, EXes (not all), Supers,Throw and Airthorw. everything else is techable
[5:24:58] <brunoberserk> triple reppuken
[5:25:02] <phatmac16> yeah she's real good
[5:25:06] <nailwind> i expected to see a lot more sabers
[5:25:07] <+Inknail> after we've played, we should probably leave the lobby to make room for others, right?
[5:25:08] <DaKnightWarrior> Been playing Akiha for years and i still don't know why her hair turns red LUL
[5:25:09] <phatmac16> top tier
[5:25:11] <Laliloluhla> no DP tho
[5:25:13] <+Arnschen> She's fun ye
[5:25:13] <+ATentacleMonster> I wouldn't go that far LUL
[5:25:14] <+SerialSins> She seems crazy
[5:25:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> feel like it was like that in previous melty as well
[5:25:15] <TheSaltminer> Geesecueid
[5:25:15] <+dakarplaugas> Also the dress is fucking great
[5:25:17] <%WeepyDevil> she isn't lol
[5:25:21] <badguy8312> trade wife Arc
[5:25:22] <Dlent_> I wonder when Reggie will realize that just isn’t a combo
[5:25:23] <+dakarplaugas> Better than the skirt
[5:25:24] <phatmac16> @DaKnightWarrior demon blood
[5:25:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> the maids are fucking super good
[5:25:30] <black_mages_matter_> @DaKnightWarrior she absorbs heat and turns her hair into fire
[5:25:33] <SirDogBear> red arc good, regular arc got all the tools you would need though
[5:25:33] <OldManDeckardCain> maids can literally ignore md bs LUL
[5:25:33] <+ratbotic> maid has assist
[5:25:35] <phatmac16> the maids are op too
[5:25:35] <nailwind> the maids are the like the only ones that kept their mbaacc strength LUL its busted
[5:25:37] <dds333a> Hisui was always great LUL
[5:25:39] <lancerofgram> @brunoberserk Saber is by no means low tier, she's bullshit and easy to learn.
[5:25:42] <BackwardCap> Melty Lore chatters, what makes Arc turn into Red Arc? gildedThink
[5:25:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> one of them just puts out items that are invincible
[5:25:51] <+Inknail> @BackwardCap bloodlust
[5:25:52] <brunoberserk> @DaKnightWarrior demon's blood
[5:25:53] <phatmac16> @BackwardCap evil ryu basically
[5:25:54] <+ATentacleMonster> bluud
[5:25:56] <beatie_g> this song is bangin' I aint gonna lie
[5:25:56] <TacoBomber> Regular Arc is more about stagger and throw pressure with a lot of corner carry because so many moves move her and the opponent forward, Red Arc has a somewhat more balanced moveset with projectiles, armor, and mixups instead of going forward a lot
[5:25:58] <DaKnightWarrior> @black_mages_matter_ that's cool as hell.
[5:26:01] <badguy8312> @backwardcap strong family values
[5:26:06] <+Inknail> after we've played, we should probably leave the lobby to make room for others, right?
[5:26:07] <alphalejandro> Old Arcueid was like more of a "monster in human flesh" character, this "new" one if more of a sociopath with powers
[5:26:15] <alphalejandro> *Red
[5:26:19] <lancerofgram> @backwardcap basically her going berserk
[5:26:19] <black_mages_matter_> @DaKnightWarrior yeah its pretty metal
[5:26:19] <Laliloluhla> It's just Arc after she got cucked
[5:26:24] <Laliloluhla> in the vn
[5:26:24] <Leud_De_Grace> RIP meter
[5:26:26] <+Genericname54321> maids right now have unblockable loops
[5:26:30] <+captain_history> @BackwardCap In this game it's basically Arc serious and unhinged
[5:26:33] <nailwind> @Inknail stay a while get some more games in
[5:26:34] <Wundae> "Conservative skirt"...with the huge slit up the side
[5:26:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Does this have rolback?
[5:26:40] <+ATentacleMonster> tfw no qt brown regular Arc anymore :(
[5:26:43] <black_mages_matter_> @DaKnightWarrior and to piggy back off what other people said, its because her family's bloodline was tainted by demons at some point
[5:26:46] <+alphonseisbest> @BallerSwagBro9k YUP
[5:26:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> noic3
[5:26:53] <OldManDeckardCain> well, tbf shiki also tried to kill her on top of chucking her
[5:26:56] <Garrison27> Where my combos cool?
[5:26:56] <dds333a> right
[5:27:00] <OldManDeckardCain> cucking*
[5:27:06] <TheSaltminer> @BackwardCap I think it may have changed with the remake. It used to be that Red Arc was a creation of the old big bad, Night of Wallachia, that's where the nickname W-Arc came from. In the new lore, I think it's just that Regular Arc is her repressing her vampire instincts and Red Arc is her embracing them
[5:27:06] <phatmac16> Nanaya install

[5:27:28] <+dakarplaugas> That is a good color
[5:27:33] <lancerofgram> Oh, Emiya colors
[5:27:35] <+dakarplaugas> Dante color
[5:27:44] <xerioes> oh its dmc4 nero
[5:27:44] <+Inknail> surprised not to see any saber mains in there
[5:27:44] <+dakarplaugas> Or Emiya I guess...
[5:27:45] <+leviting> needs more melanin for archer
[5:27:52] <DaKnightWarrior> I've only played the Melty Blood games.
[5:27:53] <nailwind> wonder if we have any killers in the lobby
[5:27:53] <Laliloluhla> This man just swangin
[5:27:58] <black_mages_matter_> @DaKnightWarrior theres a fan translation of the old tsukihime vn you can find in all sorts of places. i found the link from a youtube video
[5:27:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Oh look its Not Gudao Kappa
[5:27:59] <phatmac16> nah you can make a good shirou with his white and black jacket
[5:28:03] <dds333a> @laliloluhla for real
[5:28:16] <black_mages_matter_> @DaKnightWarrior its 60 hours, but who knows when the remake is gonna get a translation
[5:28:20] <BackwardCap> Am I the only one who thought that was a Helltaker palette? gildedDerp
[5:28:24] <phatmac16> @BallerSwagBro9k Gudao wishes he was half as cool as Shiki
[5:28:25] <badguy8312> He looks like a genderbent Hellraiser character
[5:28:33] <+kamig92> That shiki color looks like Archer
[5:28:35] <phatmac16> NANAYA MODE
[5:28:36] <DaKnightWarrior> @black_mages_matter_ Ah ok. Thanks!
[5:28:37] <+alphonseisbest> @BallerSwagBro9k ahem u mean Guduko
[5:28:39] <nailwind> @BackwardCap yo thats actually a great thought LUL
[5:28:41] <Laliloluhla> Bananaya time
[5:28:46] <lancerofgram> I mean, Remake has an automated translation out, its just kinda rough
[5:28:49] <TheSaltminer> Yeah the Nanaya mode
[5:28:51] <@Menitta> oh yeah those are like Helltaker colors
[5:28:55] <+Inknail> I've seen moon DPs get stuffed by some weird stuff sometimes
[5:28:56] <dds333a> @badguy8312 Hellraiser let's go
[5:28:58] <@Menitta> fun
[5:29:04] <@Menitta> Hellraiser

[5:29:16] <+Arnschen> Bait it
[5:29:19] <TopTierHarley> that was the worst Heat bait I've seen
[5:29:25] <dds333a> @badguy8312 nah, you meant Hellraiser Kappa
[5:29:35] <infernobluefire> GG sorry im bad
[5:29:47] <%Wool> I'm A on PC lol
[5:29:47] <phatmac16> B is a good ranking
[5:29:49] <Leud_De_Grace> LUL
[5:29:50] <dds333a> So this guy is new to me
[5:29:54] <Aussie_Manny> Here comes a new animu!
[5:29:54] <phatmac16> KIABA
[5:29:58] <Garrison27> Is it cool if we get in the lobby more than once?
[5:30:01] <phatmac16> KAIBA TIME
[5:30:03] <%Wool> Vlov's voice is so sexy
[5:30:03] <%Irridium> Vlov's a fuckin' rough fight man
[5:30:06] <alphalejandro> Vlov...the new Nero Chaos
[5:30:10] <Garrison27> Theres an open space.
[5:30:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:30:11] <%ekodrop> aite capt you got this
[5:30:15] <nailwind> vlovs a crime
[5:30:15] <lancerofgram> he's also Sigurd in FGO
[5:30:16] <TopTierHarley> RTSD Vlov
[5:30:28] <phatmac16> he's a traditional vampire
[5:30:31] <lancerofgram> I also hate fighting Vlov lol
[5:30:33] <dds333a> right LUL
[5:30:43] <OldManDeckardCain> he;s just older soma
[5:30:45] <+Inknail> @Garrison27 I'd like to know too. I've already played once (was the green hair Miyako)
[5:30:45] <+Arnschen> Ice time
[5:30:46] <TheSaltminer> they might call this guy New Nero, but he ain't worth half a Nero
[5:30:46] <nailwind> thankfully people havent mastered his projectiles yet LUL you can switch their trajectory o the fly
[5:31:02] <phatmac16> he also gets his ice when he loses
[5:31:02] <badguy8312> hoo boy this guy is getting MOPPED
[5:31:04] <Laliloluhla> Roa is more rushdown than vlov
[5:31:07] <dds333a> @nailwind oh neat, they can curve, or hard switch?
[5:31:08] <+Inknail> I'm in again as Ciel Blanco, but there's even another slot open
[5:31:10] <TheSaltminer> Vlov, aka this boring bitch we got instead of Nrvqsr
[5:31:19] <%AmuserName> How Axl-like does Vlov feel?
[5:31:21] <Mattais88> Vlov is the closest this game has to a zoner
[5:31:28] <TopTierHarley> not at all @amusername
[5:31:28] <phatmac16> so close
[5:31:32] <lancerofgram> I believe they changed Nero out for Vlov for lore reasons, given Nasu said Nero Chaos is too strong to work as a midboss in Tsuki
[5:31:33] <+captain_history> Vlov has more character to him than Nrvnqsr ever had though
[5:31:34] <nailwind> @dds333a you get 2 shots, can decide anytime which ones will go up or down
[5:31:37] <+alphonseisbest> @TheSaltminer blame Nasu for the remake
[5:31:40] <Laliloluhla> Man does not know his anti-shield OS
[5:31:43] <%AmuserName> @TopTierHarley ahhh, ok.
[5:31:44] <TheSaltminer> @Mattais88 dude, Hisui
[5:31:49] <phatmac16> yeah Nero is too strong to be beaten so easily
[5:31:51] <BackwardCap> Nobody is really using Moon Drive on wake-up. Its like the best option in the game gildedThink
[5:31:53] <@Menitta> oh boy
[5:31:54] <zenith0111> Axls a Dhalsim zoner
[5:31:58] <lancerofgram> Vlov actually kinda works as a neat foil for Shiki too
[5:31:59] <badguy8312> ezpz
[5:32:04] <dds333a> @nailwind hmmmmm, would love to see more of him
[5:32:06] <phatmac16> Vlov is a better guy to job to Shiki to early on
[5:32:14] <Leud_De_Grace> Nice juke on the blood heat
[5:32:18] <nailwind> @dds333a its very underused but extremely powerful, you can stuff any approach
[5:32:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ganbatte menitta
[5:32:21] <Laliloluhla> Yeah Nero was made to Job
[5:32:22] <+Inknail> still surprised no saber
[5:32:23] <zenith0111> Vlolvs a more projectile zoner
[5:32:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Hello Not Rin
[5:32:33] <phatmac16> she's the most popular online stats wise
[5:32:35] <+captain_history> Vlov is actually harder to Shiki than Nrvnqsr, even if the latter is stronger
[5:32:36] <Aussie_Manny> Smol Rin
[5:32:37] <+ATentacleMonster> You can't get Jamaica colors with her anymore :(
[5:32:39] <nailwind> miyako chads wilding online
[5:32:46] <Mattais88> @TheSaltminer I dunno, she feels more like a trap character. Like Naoto in p4g
[5:32:54] <badguy8312> wooliebait in a previous evolution LUL
[5:32:59] <dds333a> @atentaclemonster oh no, shit LUL

[5:33:16] <nailwind> safely approach the child
[5:33:18] <+ATentacleMonster> @dds333a Yeah.. I hope they release more skin palettes
[5:33:19] <+Inknail> KNIFE THE CHILD
[5:33:21] <Aussie_Manny> LAME IT OUT
[5:33:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> scummy LUL
[5:33:31] <%WeepyDevil> yeah original melty was a wierd meta sequel to og tsukihime, sold as a limited release at fucking comiket iirc, while type lumina is a prequel to the fancy new tsukihime, and thats why Nero, Sion, Streisbyfe, and Wallachia are gone
[5:33:44] <%WeepyDevil> cause they were original melty characters
[5:33:57] <dds333a> @weepydevil uh huh, interesting
[5:33:58] <nailwind> i will miss Warachia laughs
[5:34:08] <nailwind> wara wara
[5:34:09] <+Inknail> anyone know if it's cool to get back in line after playing a round if there are open lobby slots?
[5:34:10] <TheSaltminer> @WeepyDevil What? Nero was OG Tsukihime
[5:34:15] <@Menitta> Ah GG

[5:38:08] <nailwind> @Inknail LUL legit the only one that can 2-touch you
[5:38:20] <phatmac16> yeah they're using GGPO
[5:38:47] <+PMAvers> Maybe people's wifi is getting disrupted by something in their bathroom?
[5:38:48] <TigerClaws12> they're not clock syncing right, causing 1 sided rollback
[5:38:54] <JetpackMcQuack> call the engineers
[5:39:02] <nailwind> sweep em
[5:39:05] <%Irridium> wish this game was able to get a beta out to test it all
[5:39:06] <Laliloluhla> on pc it's just an issue of de syncs
[5:39:09] <Laliloluhla> yeah
[5:39:18] <phatmac16> yeah a beta would've been great
[5:39:21] <Laliloluhla> one player has priority
[5:39:37] <+CherteuseKapibara> literally " Fine on my end :) "
[5:39:37] <JetpackMcQuack> good connections are good
[5:39:38] <+Inknail> aaand there I go lol
[5:39:42] <Aussie_Manny> so they have rollback, but it's not implemented correctly?
[5:39:43] <phatmac16> good job Reggie

[5:40:58] <%Irridium> I mean I'll be real this is still better than Street Fighter V at launch
[5:41:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> music Kreygasm
[5:41:11] <Laliloluhla> If it's just a desync issue it should be fixed soon
[5:41:13] <+captain_history> kamone from french bread takes updating stuff seriously so  it will probably end up fixed
[5:41:15] <Laliloluhla> fans did it for SF5

[5:47:25] <DaKnightWarrior> No Mercy in Melty
[5:47:29] <nailwind> @Th3SmartAlec every iteration of saber each in her own car sitting in drive-thru
[5:47:46] <phatmac16> Oh man these frames
[5:48:05] <lancerofgram> but why would Saber want McDonalds when she can make Shirou cook for her?
[5:48:06] <badguy8312> @nailwind saber is also behind the drive thru window serving
[5:48:11] <Laliloluhla> oh it's chugging
[5:48:22] <nailwind> the saber is also the one frying the fries
[5:48:23] <phatmac16> Canonically regular saber doesn’t like burgers
[5:48:26] <+leviting> what's going on under the timer?
[5:48:32] <+Inknail> @phatmac16 booooooo
[5:48:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @lancerofgram Well, Saber Alter to be more specific, is a much more picky eater
[5:48:36] <%slimmixrp> slimmixrp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[5:48:40] <phatmac16> Saber alter is the one that likes burgers

[5:50:04] <nailwind> spicy hot cheetos
[5:50:06] <phatmac16> Surprised they let some of them through
[5:50:09] <Shad0wTag> !uptime
[5:50:09] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 50 minutes

[5:50:43] <xThomasWellertonx> Ohhh, that whiff cost him
[5:50:54] <phatmac16> Nice
[5:51:01] <phatmac16> Kouma does lots of damage
[5:51:02] <OldManDeckardCain> kohaku in maids has an unblockable
[5:51:09] <nailwind> very trigger happy shielding
[5:51:10] <+Inknail> no way they patch out the unblockables, they're charged and intended
[5:51:26] <Aussie_Manny> OUCH
[5:51:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:51:27] <BackwardCap> Its his charged 5C, he doesn't have an unblockable set-up.
[5:51:36] <lancerofgram> anytime I go against Kouma I question where my life bar went and how it went so fast
[5:51:41] <Sleepsie_> Hisui's charged watering can is unblockable, but it can still be shielded
[5:51:44] <phatmac16> Shieldy blood
[5:51:48] <phatmac16> Nice woolie
[5:52:01] <+Inknail> OOOOOOHHHHHH

[5:53:02] <SirDogBear> to be fair old melty blood had shiki as a guest char so its not totally left field LUL
[5:53:05] <Leud_De_Grace> Seibaaaaaa!
[5:53:11] <phatmac16> First saber of the night
[5:53:13] <TheSaltminer> Nero died for this
[5:53:14] <charrchord> Same universe
[5:53:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> THE QUESTION  STILL STANDS CHAT: CAN SHIKI KILL SERVANTS
[5:53:17] <xThomasWellertonx> If you are in the Carnival verse anything is possible
[5:53:18] <Laliloluhla> Saber has the best reversal super in the game
[5:53:21] <Laliloluhla> it beats throws
[5:53:27] <@Menitta> they should put Dante in this
[5:53:28] <Laliloluhla> and projectiles
[5:53:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> she does
[5:53:31] <phatmac16> Shiki kills his maids all the time
[5:53:36] <badguy8312> god these designs are such ass lmao
[5:53:38] <Shad0wTag> @alteisenreisez yes
[5:53:40] <nailwind> Satsujinki DLC when

[5:53:50] <ThatOtherBrother> hello
[5:53:55] <brunoberserk> i love that saber movelist is  almost the same from unlimited codes
[5:53:55] <+n33t_1337> @badguy8312 nah they're good
[5:53:56] <phatmac16> Yeah she has Avalon and Excalibur
[5:53:56] <TheSaltminer> @AlteisenReiseZ He can. His line when he supers Saber is the famous "This is what it means to kill people". He killin her
[5:54:00] <quietshun> @badguy8312 They're nice :)
[5:54:03] <SirDogBear> Shiki can kill anything, in kara no kyokai that shiki was able to kill words that were spoken LUL
[5:54:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @AlteisenReiseZ YES
[5:54:16] <lancerofgram> @bisoromibear Yes
[5:54:17] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Is Woolie playing it on PS4 Switch or PC
[5:54:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ps4
[5:54:32] <DaKnightWarrior> @sirdogbear LUL
[5:54:40] <nailwind> @SirDogBear this is getting out of hand LUL
[5:54:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big butter too
[5:54:50] <@Menitta> melty fans when Gacha McMoneymaker is announced for type lumina instead of Shu Scrimblusawa the loveable side characteer from the fan translated VN they played 20 years ago
[5:54:52] <+Inknail> I tried lol
[5:54:54] <nintega010> this saber seems new
[5:54:55] <Laliloluhla> little early there
[5:54:58] <TheSaltminer> @SirDogBear Ryougi is different from Tohno. Ryougi kills conceptual (words, souls, dimensions), Tohno kills the physical (people, objects, planets)
[5:55:02] <phatmac16> Gotta use heat more
[5:55:08] <Mattais88> Zone her out like you're an Archer
[5:55:12] <+Inknail> gg dude
[5:55:16] <+captain_history> it does yeah
[5:55:16] <brunoberserk> no excalibuuuuuuur ?
[5:55:20] <phatmac16> It does
[5:55:22] <+sou1less_> it does
[5:55:24] <SirDogBear> good point @TheSaltminer Tohno gotta up his game PogChamp
[5:55:25] <phatmac16> Avalon triggers
[5:55:29] <+Inknail> @brunoberserk I'm not that good lol
[5:55:43] <brunoberserk> @Menitta LUL
[5:55:45] <+alphonseisbest> @Menitta that a fucking scrimblo bilmbo joke? LUL
[5:55:47] <Leud_De_Grace> KOHAKU gaming continues!
[5:55:55] <dds333a> just Ryu for reg LUL
[5:55:56] <phatmac16> Someone needs to play Hisui and we got the whole cast
[5:55:57] <+Hacerous> Reg aint never loyal.. BibleThump
[5:55:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> the problem is i like most of the cast
[5:56:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause god daaaamn they all feel great
[5:56:07] <@Menitta> I have literally never touched this char
[5:56:08] <TheSaltminer> @SirDogBear Dude still kills PLANETS. His game's plenty up already
[5:56:08] <yukichocomilk> I like so many characters too
[5:56:09] <Sleepsie_> I'm glad Woolie knows Ciel is a badass naroEhehe
[5:56:12] <yukichocomilk> can't choose a main LUL
[5:56:14] <phatmac16> Ciel is badass
[5:56:17] <nailwind> Melty itself feels good to play so that by extension makes every character fun to use
[5:56:19] <SirDogBear> lol fair enough @TheSaltminer LUL
[5:56:24] <black_mages_matter_> kohaku has milia tier setplay, this might be a good match
[5:56:26] <+Inknail> I really like Miyako, but I'm objectively better at using Ciel
[5:56:37] <Leud_De_Grace> "Daaashu!"
[5:56:46] <lancerofgram> I want to main Shiki because he's my favorite member of the cast (I like all of them tho)
[5:56:51] <blackkanye> I understand that
[5:57:03] <blackkanye> That is why I feel afraid to play other characters
[5:57:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah that's understandable
[5:57:15] <dds333a> I feel the same, feel like an amateur if I'm not maining
[5:57:16] <phatmac16> That’s fair
[5:57:21] <SirDogBear> yea this game in particular also, it feels like they really want clean inputs BibleThump
[5:57:26] <nailwind> will we see plant watering
[5:57:31] <%Irridium> On the other hand people who just pick random and can make it work are gods
[5:57:34] <+Inknail> yeah, that makes sense. I'll main a character until I feel at least adequate with them
[5:57:35] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm that same way - if I don't know at least 2-3 bnbs with a character I don't use them online FeelsBadMan
[5:57:35] <@Menitta> Ah my god lmao
[5:57:36] <@Menitta> GG
[5:57:39] <Leud_De_Grace> Hey! Johnny!
[5:57:39] <xThomasWellertonx> The plants with the save
[5:57:42] <@Menitta> It was never my turn LUL
[5:57:43] <Mattais88> Plant that flower on her grave
[5:57:44] <nailwind> @Irridium there are people who choose their main by who they first got on random
[5:57:46] <phatmac16> Gg
[5:57:50] <DaKnightWarrior> Best maid.
[5:57:50] <dds333a> double threat LUL
[5:57:51] <+Inknail> oh boy, Reggie's goin maid
[5:57:52] <lancerofgram> why maids so busted lol
[5:57:54] <yukichocomilk> kohaku with hisui assist is objectively better
[5:58:00] <TheSaltminer> and if you take a round off her, that just lets Kohaku summon the SWORD TROGDOR
[5:58:02] <+Hacerous> plus frames are an illusion!
[5:58:02] <phatmac16> Her crazy plants
[5:58:06] <Leud_De_Grace> Nero Palette
[5:58:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh no reggie is gonna become toxic

[5:58:39] <+Maleicus> why does he get two fighters
[5:58:43] <+Maleicus> unfair
[5:58:43] <+Inknail> wasn't there another saber in the queue?
[5:58:44] <Teras_ode> Umu maids?
[5:58:44] <%ZweihanderSteve> YOU ✓

[5:59:27] <Leud_De_Grace> You can switch before the match starts
[5:59:28] <yukichocomilk> yeah you can swap before the round actually starts
[5:59:30] <TheSaltminer> you can tag in pre fight
[5:59:38] <nailwind> tag in your sister for a double lariat
[5:59:43] <Leud_De_Grace> Hisui with THE CHAIR

[6:04:38] <lancerofgram> Aoko
[6:04:38] <brunoberserk> Michael ''WARCRIMES'' Roa
[6:04:38] <blackkanye> We all want Aoko back
[6:04:43] <+Inknail> I think she'll come back if there's dlc
[6:04:44] <@Menitta> I want the girl scout with gun back
[6:04:45] <TheSaltminer> MAXIMUM SUGOI SUGOI
[6:04:46] <dds333a> Aoko isn't here, fuck
[6:04:47] <phatmac16> Aoko
[6:04:48] <@Menitta> Whats her name
[6:04:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Aoko... still waiting on Mahoyo to be translated
[6:04:54] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Hey Arcurin lol
[6:04:54] <Zebroneath> Aoko fucking rules
[6:04:55] <TheSaltminer> @Menitta Sion
[6:04:56] <brunoberserk> she will probably gonna be a DLC
[6:04:56] <alphalejandro> Aoko's a witch
[6:04:58] <@Menitta> Sion yeah
[6:04:59] <dds333a> big punches really fun
[6:05:00] <@Menitta> Sion is cool
[6:05:01] <blackkanye> Aoko being a fucking strong mother fucker in a t-shirt and jeans makes her cooler
[6:05:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> HOMEGIRL IS IN WRANGLERS AND A WHITE-T AND STILL KICKS ASS
[6:05:04] <+Inknail> I think Aoko and Sacchin (the grappler schoolgirl) will get in
[6:05:06] <lancerofgram> Also legit canonically one of the strongest mages in the Nasuverse
[6:05:09] <Sleepsie_> All they have to do to flair Aoko up is give her a light coat or kimono like Yuzuriha from UNI
[6:05:10] <BimboBagging> Eltnum Kappa
[6:05:10] <+Strahlenwaffeln> well she should have Quad jump and 3 Airdashes in moondrive^^
[6:05:10] <%Irridium> Rockin' that Hank Hill look
[6:05:11] <+KENTASHIRO> That character has the same VA as Misato too. So, you know, bonus
[6:05:11] <nailwind> Aokos drip is to transcendent that it loops back around to being sick
[6:05:14] <Twistedoldham> Shes like the strongest mage ever or some shit so she just dresses however she wants cuz fuck it. Thats lore
[6:05:17] <dds333a> @lancerofgram truth
[6:05:29] <Leud_De_Grace> Oh yeah, I like Hisui's projectiles where she just chucks vases, lamps, and trays at you LUL
[6:05:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:05:30] <dds333a> Circuits EXPLODING
[6:05:35] <TheSaltminer> I don't mind the dripless designs, reminds me of Tekken 3 casual outfits, fuckin loved those
[6:05:35] <+Inknail> Is that a Rin pallette on that Arc?
[6:05:38] <brunoberserk> tohasaka colors
[6:05:45] <phatmac16> Yeah Aoko can cause the heat death of the universe but dresses casually
[6:05:46] <%fetrigon> @inknail ye
[6:05:53] <+Inknail> noice
[6:05:55] <+MTLxSpider> theres a lot of fate color reference
[6:05:56] <+MTLxSpider> so yea
[6:05:57] <Leud_De_Grace> HEADBUTT
[6:05:59] <black_mages_matter_> @Inknail they got a linne palette too, complete with spats
[6:06:01] <lancerofgram> yeah, you can make Ciel look like Mashu too
[6:06:06] <TheSaltminer> Hisui's throw is GODLIKE
[6:06:11] <+Hacerous> always choose violence!
[6:06:15] <+Inknail> wakeup grab is legit
[6:06:17] <+ATentacleMonster> it's nice and mean LUL
[6:06:25] <brunoberserk> Aoko is a Walking NUKE
[6:06:27] <SirDogBear> yea i totally shield for oki LUL
[6:06:31] <nailwind> oki shield catches mashers LUL
[6:06:33] <+dakarplaugas> Huh Rin colors
[6:06:41] <Aussie_Manny> But wait, if Woolie's here, then who uploaded the Deltarune video 50 seconds ago?? D:
[6:06:50] <+Inknail> everyon'e scared to shield counter now
[6:06:51] <Mattais88> Arc always sounds like she's saying DUNK on her air grabs
[6:06:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm a stud, I'm ballsy. I don't shield on oki, like YOU. OHOHOHOHOHO
[6:06:59] <+Inknail> @Mattais88 she is lol
[6:07:04] <BimboBagging> Yeah that's a good ass point. people out there saying dripless but then fangasm all over Jin's schoolboy outfit LUL
[6:07:09] <Leud_De_Grace> LETS GOOOOO!
[6:07:09] <SirDuke26> MURDER
[6:07:12] <+ATentacleMonster> @Aussie_Manny This is pre-recorded :)
[6:07:13] <Leud_De_Grace> Slay all
[6:07:13] <irfan_> last arc finish let's go
[6:07:13] <%Irridium> PogChamp
[6:07:14] <nailwind> god that face i love it
[6:07:14] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Now i'm a little motivated
[6:07:16] <dds333a> @kosorsomesaykosm_ LUL
[6:07:16] <+Inknail> that murder super is great
[6:07:25] <Mattais88> @Inknail Really, I thought it was just me mishearing some japanese
[6:07:27] <Aussie_Manny> Fake stream?!
[6:07:30] <%iHum4n> 👏
[6:07:38] <xThomasWellertonx> Life always finds a way
[6:07:40] <RatedShadowRiasXrd> Hisui: My Power shall be absoulte
[6:07:41] <alphalejandro> Akiha: "Snap out it!"
[6:07:43] <brunoberserk> that akiha kick is the best part LUL
[6:07:45] <phatmac16> Controlled by the sword
[6:07:46] <+KBGuilty> Hey Reggie, with hisui after the air throw in the air if you havent double jumped you can jump after the throw in the air. you can neutral jump and drift left/right for a nasty mix
[6:07:48] <TacoBomber> Moon drive canceling after some stuff will let you confirm into Last Arc
[6:07:50] <Leud_De_Grace> Hisui's a blade nut, so she has to be bonked by her sister/akiha in order to regain her senses
[6:07:50] <phatmac16> And kicked by Akiha
[6:07:51] <+Strahlenwaffeln> some checracters have combos to last arc but its not worth it
[6:07:55] <phatmac16> One of the best arcs
[6:07:57] <SirDuke26> seeing that Nero pfp just reminded me how we've never had him in a fighting game before and now im mad
[6:08:04] <xThomasWellertonx> @Aussie_Manny His afterimage
[6:08:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's a good color, glad it's back
[6:08:11] <phatmac16> Noel
[6:08:17] <phatmac16> Haven’t played Noel or seen one
[6:08:26] <+KBGuilty> hisui is especially good about that because she falls with the enemy
[6:08:30] <+ParzAno> remeber, you can alays frame cancel a loss into a salty moment for free
[6:08:34] <+ParzAno> always
[6:08:38] <phatmac16> Someone pick Noel please
[6:08:57] <+Strahlenwaffeln> Pretty much everyone can do it you sometimes have to superjump like with kohaku
[6:09:01] <lancerofgram> @phatmac16 you mean the Seagull right?
[6:09:05] <phatmac16> Yup
[6:09:08] <+Hacerous> throwing swords for the Lawd!
[6:09:09] <nailwind> the double jump gives you better oki too
[6:09:13] <phatmac16> The seagull teacher
[6:09:17] <%fetrigon> kensouClap SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[6:09:24] <TacoBomber> Noel's got a lot of good built in stuff like her 236 for baiting/countering wakeup Heat, and her buttons are easy to combo into at whatever range
[6:09:28] <+Inknail> @phatmac16 Someone else can take the fall this time. I picked Saber for a quick death earlier lol. I also don't know Noel at all, but she's a beast in good hands
[6:09:36] <blackkanye> I gotta stop playing Warc and play someone else. I am not too sure warc is for me. Or I gotta get used to this game better.
[6:09:52] <mothdude> The Cacturn!
[6:09:55] <lancerofgram> Noel's range is disgusting ngl
[6:09:55] <phatmac16> Hopefully Reggie picks Noel
[6:09:56] <+Inknail> DASHED THROUGH THE SWORDS
[6:10:05] <blackkanye> Johnny COMON
[6:10:21] <+Inknail> use that meter Sins
[6:10:32] <phatmac16> HEY JOHNNY
[6:10:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> confess your sins to nubian queen ciel
[6:10:42] <Aussie_Manny> 16t
[6:10:51] <mrtrillballins> had no idea this game was out
[6:10:52] <Leud_De_Grace> Amazing that this guy's still holding on to his moon icons and meter
[6:10:56] <nailwind> they built pyramids for this ciel
[6:10:58] <Leud_De_Grace> Better make use of it this round
[6:10:59] <TheSaltminer> cmon Kohjaku give us the trogdor

[6:11:59] <dds333a> fuck
[6:12:00] <Leud_De_Grace> But it didnt matter lol
[6:12:04] <+Inknail> blood heat is always the better option
[6:12:08] <nailwind> LUL how did they live
[6:12:11] <TheSaltminer> misses the Trogdor but wins anyway
[6:12:18] <Leud_De_Grace> the whiff was the biggest juke all along
[6:12:24] <phatmac16> Yo that comeback
[6:12:25] <TacoBomber> moon drive on wakeup and moon drive (not roman) cancel to make stuff safe
[6:12:26] <lancerofgram> this is Kohaku's world and we're just living in it
[6:12:29] <phatmac16> Nice Kohaku

[6:14:39] <yukichocomilk> the guitar is so good
[6:14:39] <TacoBomber> You can set pause to hold instead of press in the options menu
[6:14:45] <+Inknail> ahh
[6:15:10] <yukichocomilk> @TacoBomber that's really good to know LUL i'll change mine immediately
[6:15:14] <dds333a> wut is happening

[6:15:41] <+dakarplaugas> God WHY IS THERE NO FGO FIGHTING GAME THAT CHARACTER ROSTER IS FREE!!
[6:15:42] <Aussie_Manny> Return to monke, and fight me again.
[6:15:47] <DSD24> Yeah its Miyakyo time!
[6:15:57] <nailwind> clap clap
[6:15:58] <+Hacerous> MIYAKO!!!
[6:16:02] <+Hacerous> lets go!
[6:16:03] <DSD24> @dakarplaugas Make it all Saberfaces that would sell
[6:16:13] <nailwind> @dakarplaugas id kill to have Karna
[6:16:14] <dds333a> @dakarplaugas release roster how many are you thinking?
[6:16:23] <%BisoromiBear> Saber X Saber All Stars
[6:16:24] <%WeepyDevil> @dakarplaugas possibly a rights issue? since like every 3rd character has a different artist?
[6:16:25] <Mattais88> Is that a CC colour?
[6:16:43] <+dakarplaugas> @DSD24 No I need my Hassan Waifu or no but
[6:16:45] <DSD24> In a FGO fighting game all I want is Penthesilea
[6:16:49] <dds333a> @dsd24 she was around before too LUL
[6:17:01] <+MTLxSpider> @dakarplaugas just pay typemoon 10million dollar. maybe they can do it
[6:17:10] <lancerofgram> I mean, French Bread said they were working in a different TM fighter before this, and its why Saber got in because they had her model and moves already done
[6:17:21] <phatmac16> A little gremlin
[6:17:22] <DSD24> First Hassan grappler lets go
[6:17:25] <lancerofgram> So a Fate fighter isn't impossible
[6:17:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Ivan the Terrible grappler thooo
[6:17:44] <+Kenidashi> chuck this child
[6:17:44] <TheSaltminer> @lancerofgram Fate fighter already happened, it was on PS2
[6:17:50] <Leud_De_Grace> Grounded the child
[6:17:53] <+Inknail> gg woolie, wish I was a better challnege lol
[6:17:54] <Twistedoldham> Body slam the child into the dirt
[6:17:56] <dds333a> @lancerofyeah, but he wants an fgo fighter Kappa
[6:17:57] <DSD24> @TheSaltminer Fate Unlimited Codes to be exact
[6:17:59] <phatmac16> Surprised they haven’t gotten arc sys to make a fighting game
[6:18:00] <alphalejandro> Throw the child
[6:18:03] <lancerofgram> I know, Unlimited Codes lol
[6:18:07] <+Hacerous> @Inknail GG
[6:18:10] <lancerofgram> meant a more modern ine by FB
[6:18:11] <Mattais88> Tiger collisuem too
[6:18:11] <yukichocomilk> proper combos are so hard in this game
[6:18:14] <Leud_De_Grace> Kohaku Challenger!
[6:18:15] <DSD24> Hey its Okita
[6:18:18] <+Inknail> @Hacerous thank
[6:18:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Neko Arc lul
[6:18:25] <Aussie_Manny> Uhoh, back to the lab again! Oh no, back to the lab again!
[6:18:41] <Leud_De_Grace> Hanzo STEEL
[6:18:42] <TheSaltminer> @DSD24 Okita can't summon Trogdor, that's Ryoma
[6:18:44] <brunoberserk> @Aussie_Manny LUL LUL LUL
[6:18:54] <+Inknail> @lancerofgram so they definitely didn't mean this game when they said 'type-moon fighter'?
[6:18:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh  yeah, High Low mixups are TRUE in this game, you can't block em
[6:18:57] <+dakarplaugas> @dds333a I was thinking a like 7 initialcharacters for all the classes ad more for the extras
[6:19:00] <DSD24> @TheSaltminer Oryu and Ryoma are real cute together
[6:19:33] <Leud_De_Grace> yeah, kohaku's charged 236B can knock back
[6:19:49] <+dakarplaugas> @dds333a I am split between Serenity or Gramps for assassin
[6:20:07] <DSD24> @dakarplaugas Go for the obscure pick and go for Hundred Personas
[6:20:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:20:08] <dds333a> @dakarplaugas not bad. conservative, but definitely a roster for every character to get enough time
[6:20:11] <+dakarplaugas> On one hand I love Serenity but on the other GRAMPS IS THE COOLEST
[6:20:18] <Leud_De_Grace> yeah wasnt buying that blood heat
[6:20:21] <alphalejandro> Woolie the coward
[6:20:22] <lancerofgram> @inknail there's an interview somewhere that they mention working in a different IP of fighter and Saber was one of many models they had finished for said fighter before deciding to make a new Melty in collab with the Tsuki remake
[6:20:22] <Mattais88> plit the difference and go with Cleopatra
[6:20:37] <+pectusumbra> You'd have to make it Gramps for being popular and breaking up the waifus
[6:20:41] <+Inknail> Yan Qing or Ryougi for assassin rep imo
[6:20:48] <Leud_De_Grace> dang, no spinning plant pressure suprisingly
[6:20:49] <TheSaltminer> @lancerofgram I know when Ono took over he mentioned an unrevealed project, and that was after Type Lumina's announcement
[6:20:54] <DSD24> Put in Nitocris or Scheherazade for Casters
[6:21:05] <TheSaltminer> sif not Sanzang for Casters
[6:21:07] <+dakarplaugas> @dds333a Hundred or arm aren't obscure since they BOTH WERE IN A MAINLINE ANIME
[6:21:13] <+Ikaruga_> ggs
[6:21:14] <nailwind> shiny a+
[6:21:17] <Aussie_Manny> I hope this game is a step towards an FGO fighting game. There are some cool looking characters and fighting styles in that cast.
[6:21:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> war crimes time?
[6:21:24] <DSD24> Oh god its Roa
[6:21:29] <+Inknail> here we go lol
[6:21:32] <alphalejandro> No Noel players huh?
[6:21:38] <Leud_De_Grace> time for more Honest Mids
[6:21:40] <dds333a> @kosorsomesaykosm_ unfortunately not LUL
[6:21:40] <TigerClaws12> honest mids
[6:21:59] <Leud_De_Grace> got that DP
[6:22:00] <+pectusumbra> I'm surprised that chaos guy isn't in this
[6:22:04] <+Inknail> the conversions on this guy
[6:22:04] <Qu1ckyyy> His face portrait looks like an even crazier Okabe Rintaro
[6:22:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @dds333a spiritually I'm there though
[6:22:08] <%probably_facetious> @alphalejandro Nahx Sajam dropped Melty a couple of days ago
[6:22:12] <VritraReiRei> So is this supposed to be a younger version of Roa?
[6:22:18] <dds333a> @kosorsomesaykosm_ LUL LUL LUL
[6:22:22] <mothdude> I miss Chaos's Jump C so much ;_;
[6:22:25] <DSD24> I think its a Roa redesign
[6:22:31] <%BisoromiBear> @Qu1ckyyy from the Sigma world line
[6:22:32] <+Inknail> @probably_facetious wasn't it because he was having setup issues because he was on PC?
[6:22:33] <Leud_De_Grace> damn, got that blood heat
[6:22:38] <nailwind> THE WALK UOP
[6:22:56] <+Hacerous> "Your bar is mine.. it belongs to me!"
[6:22:56] <23rald> you probably want to give fate fighting game project to established fighting game devs, but everyone seems to have their own project right now.
[6:22:56] <Mattais88> I just noticed, Is Roa wearing a tube top?
[6:22:58] <%probably_facetious> @inknail That's what I heard
[6:23:13] <phatmac16> Canon match
[6:23:20] <phatmac16> Yeah tube top
[6:23:22] <Leud_De_Grace> The real Honest Mids
[6:23:31] <TigerClaws12> and wake up
[6:23:41] <Aussie_Manny> doodMash
[6:23:43] <+Inknail> @probably_facetious unfortunate. PC would be the right place if not for the setup issues
[6:23:50] <nailwind> show us the sauce and achieve that S
[6:23:52] <+MTLxSpider> jiyuEye honest mids jiyuEye
[6:23:54] <TigerClaws12> doodMash always moon drive if oki is coming
[6:23:55] <TacoBomber> Moon drive is really good on wakeup and can also be used like a roman cancel
[6:23:57] <lancerofgram> I mean, if we go based on popularity: Saber: Artoria, Archer: Emiya or Gil, Lancer: Cu or Karna, Caster: Merlin, Assassin: King Hassan, Rider: Iskandar, Drake, or Ozy, Berserker: Herc, Avenger: Jalter, Alter Ego: Melt, Foreigner: Abigail, Ruler: Jeanne, Shielder: Mashu are who I see for reps of each class for a fate fighter
[6:23:58] <dds333a> So after this march and the last match, I gotta say I prefer his long hair over the mullet he has now
[6:24:00] <cheapdoc> SHU JIN KO
[6:24:02] <%Charronia> limesKnife
[6:24:07] <%probably_facetious> Moon Drive sajamMash sajamMash sajamMash
[6:24:07] <nailwind> hold this fruit knife
[6:24:10] <phatmac16> Nanaya time
[6:24:15] <TigerClaws12> there it is LUL
[6:24:16] <Aussie_Manny> he's all white
[6:24:26] <+itsdalfo> Michael's mids only got more honest
[6:24:26] <+Inknail> I always choose consoles for my fighting games these days, because I worry about hardware/software-specific issues
[6:24:35] <Twistedoldham> Sauced
[6:24:36] <nailwind> yeah this guys a killer
[6:24:37] <Aussie_Manny> He's either a ghost, or he just got covered in flour by Kevin McAllister.
[6:24:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Stop him quick, He'll go Nanaya and unplug his router
[6:24:44] <+Inknail> the shiki players are back
[6:24:48] <Leud_De_Grace> Banana Shiki but white palette
[6:24:54] <phatmac16> He heard you talking shit
[6:24:58] <nailwind> its always the damn shiki players that pull up with real plays
[6:25:00] <+Inknail> same-side mixups
[6:25:04] <yukichocomilk> actual mr. arc system works
[6:25:08] <TigerClaws12> cause he is cool reggie
