[0:11:00] <%Chatterbox1991> Dragon Age Inquisition
[0:11:04] <%SirGO0SE> YO THATS REAL
[0:11:04] <Zebroneath> LA Noire is an example
[0:11:07] <+Graem> I have that problem with Pat
[0:11:14] <%CursedNobleman> WHA HAPPUN?
[0:11:20] <@Menitta> hah
[0:11:20] <TheMrRental> Metroid Prime 2 is the best one fight me
[0:11:21] <@Menitta> yeah
[0:11:23] <milhousego> how far are we in the game?
[0:11:24] <Papa_Bearman> Question for everybody: does 'The Last of Us, Part II' have a rape scene in it? I've heard things about that and it makes me not excited.
[0:11:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MOBAMON
[0:11:36] <%SirGO0SE> ya man high level pokemon is legit
[0:11:36] <Rhinoprotoss> But swim in the toxic like Pat tho
[0:11:37] <%CursedNobleman> @Papa_Bearman no rape
[0:11:38] <armchairmaster_> Wha Happun: Every game to come out in the last few years.
[0:11:39] <+bigchuck> la noire is an excellent example @zebroneath
[0:11:43] <%R3Roundabout> Too many games have launched as broken pieces of shot to not feel concerned
[0:11:43] <Esparsenior> @milhousego starting 3rd chapter
[0:11:44] <Papa_Bearman> @CursedNobleman OK, thanks.
[0:11:48] <%SirGO0SE> its a shame the best pokemon player in the world is barely paid LUL
[0:11:49] <%Mczutioni> MP2 was annoying
[0:11:52] <squidpeanut> @milhousego right before chp 3
[0:11:53] <@Menitta> Pokemon PVP is so nuts that I want to ignore its existence lol
[0:11:57] <%gatorafan> PvP Pokemon is crazy daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:11:57] <Solidnick18> that was a crazy nuzlocke
[0:12:01] <DopeyDragon> Pokemon is all mind games
[0:12:03] <+GreenCMD> pokemon fans complain about paper cuts while the yugiohchads silently suffer deep wounds.
[0:12:04] <scorpionoutcast> Has a sex scene, don’t think there’s a rape scene
[0:12:07] <+terry_quest> bring back megas
[0:12:08] <Prevot> which is why everyone who wants the battle system to change is dumb
[0:12:09] <Papa_Bearman> I think MP2 is the best, and that's a high bar that MP1 made. MP3 was solid, too.
[0:12:10] <PhantomMaskJr> Hardcore Pokémon bronzeDED
[0:12:14] <+terry_quest> kill dynamax
[0:12:18] <JetpackMcQuack> It has an identity crises
[0:12:28] <rubbishbinge> i just want mega back
[0:12:29] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Boy they sure don't anymore
[0:12:32] <%SirGO0SE> Nintendo LOVES stumbling into great competitive enviornments and then ignoring them
[0:12:32] <shiny_prinny> i can't handle some of the rng in pokemon with paralysis, freeze, confusion, and attract status
[0:12:32] <Equirah> you should care how the factory operates tho
[0:12:32] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Yeah, the Youtube channel False Swipe Gaming does great break downs of Pokemon and how they deal with competitive matches.
[0:12:34] <armchairmaster_> Just play Third Strike forever chat Kappa you'll never be dissapointed in other video games
[0:12:35] <Iam_Dead> why would you take PvP Pokemon seriously when you can have a team of 6 metronomers? LUL
[0:12:35] <Solidnick18> yeah it's not great
[0:12:35] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @rubbishbinge Me too, man
[0:12:37] <DopeyDragon> More SOUO
[0:12:40] <+AbnormalVoid> nobody finds out about the meta in pokemon cause unit customization is tedious garbage
[0:12:40] <DopeyDragon> soul
[0:12:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> Man competitive Pokemon is some fucking shit. I went into it back in Black and White and my IQ rose by 20 points anytime I sent out my Tyranitar
[0:12:47] <+Estuko> I don't really play pokemon with others, last I did was moon lol
[0:12:48] <slimey0> not really lmao
[0:12:52] <GenericSoda> Digimon has that banger opening theme
[0:12:53] <andrex2311> Pokemon lose it's love at Gen 5
[0:12:56] <+worldbrand> They need to restructure their whole team man
[0:12:57] <andrex2311> lost*
[0:13:06] <%heartlesshealer> "we hate money"
[0:13:07] <DopeyDragon> It's really just Pokemon Company
[0:13:10] <Prevot> one thing with digimon recently is they're trying to make different types of games
[0:13:10] <%wibbwobbler> it's a cash cow, they can't help themselves
[0:13:11] <%Hawk_Rush> pokemon :(
[0:13:19] <%ConAirOnDVD> Pokemon is just straight up boring and lazy now
[0:13:19] <%SirGO0SE> sword shield sucks a lot of ass b ut the online vs is not part of that ass sucking its real good
[0:13:21] <$alwaysneedcaffiene> cyberslueth was pretty good.
[0:13:21] <+Mondeiya> fire emblem goes all over the place in contrast
[0:13:23] <TheMrRental> I still replay MP2 every year but I can't stomach replaying MP1 and spending another 4 hours going between magmoor caverns and every other area...
[0:13:25] <andrex2311> Gen 5 was the last that felt had love put into it
[0:13:28] <MattDemers> Nintendo relies too much on the "Nintendo Magic" now.
[0:13:28] <+worldbrand> No other projects stand out as badly as pokemon does really
[0:13:29] <+Dr_DangerPhD> pokemon's ownership split def affects its dev focus
[0:13:31] <%ekodrop> lies reggie
[0:13:33] <GenericSoda> like Valve stuff as of late
[0:13:33] <Solidnick18> last one i ever play was x and y
[0:13:34] <dizimous> Nintendo can water down things at times, but with pokemon it's been constant for like 8 years now
[0:13:36] <%prime_name> Always the bare minimum with some flare sparkled in
[0:13:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Too simplistic
[0:13:38] <%Ancopro> so far switch zelda and mario showed a lot of real effort, but pokemon...
[0:13:38] <%gatorafan> it's still selling that means it's good - One Guy
[0:13:40] <cipher758> low effort big gains. they get away with it too
[0:13:40] <+AJiiij> oh mobamon
[0:13:43] <shiny_prinny> it kinda feels like a greed thing, but idk
[0:13:43] <PhantomMaskJr> Who needs love when you have sacks of money 💰💰💰💰 thuluHEY 💰💰💰💰
[0:13:46] <pixel_river> pokemon changes very slowly
[0:13:46] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> They don't want to re-structure their work environment or put in more investment unfortunately
[0:13:47] <+AJiiij> mobamon gonna fail hard
[0:13:49] <+JoeCoolMaverick> I feel like Game Freak and the Pokemon Company try to introduce quality of life improvements to the main line games, even to it's detriment.
[0:13:54] <squidpeanut> Nintendo waters itself down for years than releases a genre defining entry. Pokémon hasn’t really done that
[0:13:55] <%arkv01> iphone is that premium cocaine
[0:13:55] <+terry_quest> minimum effort
[0:13:58] <%Hawk_Rush> it's watered down when it doesn't need to be
[0:13:59] <%SirGO0SE> ATTACK AND DETHRONE Pokemon
[0:14:00] <%ekodrop> you can mess up an apple the hell you talking about reggie
[0:14:00] <Rhinoprotoss> Quality of life changes in new Pokemon games are really nice
[0:14:06] <GamecubesGiganticAButton> Nintendos all about doing more with less
[0:14:06] <derap41> There wasn't any animation
[0:14:07] <Prevot> if pokemon was made by Nintendo themselves if would be WAY better
[0:14:08] <Darren716> Mobamon is going to be the most profitable pokemon game ever
[0:14:10] <%Lion_kun> Pokemon is a massive IP handled by an underfunded indie company
[0:14:14] <Darren716> Just you watch
[0:14:14] <+baggy3058> SwSh was the first game I didn't get.
[0:14:18] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Gens 6 and 7 were kinda jank
[0:14:26] <%HitchhikingThrough> HitchhikingThrough subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Channel's been getting better and better recently. Still working on my DMC modding. Had an idea to give Nero a "just color up"-release the gun button just after the reload finishes to do an EX charge shot. Interested?
[0:14:30] <%DappercatEsquire> Literally the most profitable media franchise in the world
[0:14:30] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Yeah, Game Freak always had a low budget feel to every game they made, even their more independent stuff.
[0:14:30] <MattDemers> The first time I got to an Open Field zone it was snowstorming, and it lagged to hell and back, even in dock mode.
[0:14:30] <DopeyDragon> @darren716 It's China money. Of course it will.
[0:14:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Gen 4 was the last decent Gen
[0:14:33] <+AJiiij> gen 6 was the last gen it felt like they stopped caring
[0:14:33] <DeRedBaron> I kinda like that everyone says *Nintendo* and Woolie says *The Pokemon Company* meaning most dont have as much perspective
[0:14:34] <pixel_river> and want a completely New battle system
[0:14:37] <%kyh9> compare pokemon to Monolith SOFT and the xenoblade games
[0:14:39] <%SirGO0SE> @Darren716 that statement is crazy not because of how well the moba will do but because of how well pokemon has done already lol
[0:14:42] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Gen 8, which was the *first generation on a real console*, was massively underwhelming
[0:14:47] <%ConAirOnDVD> @lion_kun bruh is that sarcasm
[0:14:49] <Potatoidea> Pokemon MOBA instead
[0:14:52] <GenericSoda> why didn't Game Freak go all in on Tembo
[0:14:53] <Prevot> drop Pokemon in the hands of Nintendo's main teams or Monolith Soft and we'd get what we actually want
[0:14:56] <Rhinoprotoss> Why would you make a game when there's merch
[0:14:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:14:59] <%supersugoisenpai1> Whoever designs the characters at least does a great job
[0:15:04] <+AJiiij> mobamon is gonna be aweful xD
[0:15:16] <noobpsyboticus> game freak is trash. this has been long aknowledged
[0:15:16] <PhantomMaskJr> There isn’t enough internet for a Pokémon MMO
[0:15:16] <%wibbwobbler> i think they are scared to set the bar too high
[0:15:18] <shiny_prinny> pokemon needs to feel like it's actually an rpg
[0:15:20] <Darren716> Put Woolie why should they put in effort when they are already making a shit ton of money putting this effort in? Like SwSh were the best selling games in the franchise
[0:15:20] <%SirGO0SE> facts
[0:15:24] <DeRedBaron> cus game freak is owned by the pokemon company and game greak doesn't have the actual power to do that
[0:15:25] <+linSP> I don’t mind a Pokémon moba, but it looks so shitty
[0:15:26] <%arkv01> the writers and art design guys at pokemon seem pretty competent, maybe their devs are technically stunted?
[0:15:26] <%HitchhikingThrough> Yeah, that's correct
[0:15:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Messy development cycle? You mean Halo? The campaign itself was completed in about five months and approximately 80% of the script wasn't done until after mid-2001 (the game released in November 2001).
[0:15:28] <TheMrRental> Yeah gen 7 character designs onwards have been particularly great
[0:15:30] <Potatoidea> That's a good analogy
[0:15:31] <derap41> its clearly been working
[0:15:31] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Like, the new Isle of Armor expansion for Sword and Shield feels like the game as it should have been, to me anyway.
[0:15:32] <%Ancopro> i remember when Colosseum came out i thought that was the direction they were gonna go
[0:15:33] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Here's the thing though, if it was "the same thing every time" we'd be happy, but they keep cutting features!
[0:15:36] <%kyh9> Pokemon has progressed less than mario
[0:15:37] <%FusRoDom> Wow he did Skyward Sword dirty
[0:15:38] <glass_marcus> were paying 20 extra dollars for a lateral move
[0:15:40] <JetpackMcQuack> FeelsBadMan
[0:15:42] <%Lion_kun> Gamefreak is a nothing company that gets pokemon because theyre cheap
[0:15:46] <Prevot> they were coasting on the fact it was only on handhelds
[0:15:46] <%Pinkiefan> That's an excellent analogy.
[0:15:48] <armchairmaster_> Nintendo is slowly drying up their mainstays. Pokemon's bad, Starfox, Kid Icarus, and F-Zero haven't really got huge sequels in ages, and Metroid Prime 4 and Breath of the Wild 2 are still a long time away.
[0:15:50] <DopeyDragon> Pokemon became soulless after Gen 2.
[0:15:50] <Darren716> If LttP sold millions of copies each time why would they bother changing?
[0:15:51] <Solidnick18> now you get botw2
[0:15:52] <pixel_river> game doesnt seem giant as a company
[0:15:53] <DeRedBaron> as i said game freak isn't the compnay
[0:15:54] <%Mczutioni> Wasnt BoWs world made by Monolith?
[0:15:54] <%Hawk_Rush> mainline pokemon games have never had a "what a breath of fresh air" moment... only their spinoffs
[0:15:54] <andrex2311> the only good thing about SwSh is the character design and Marnie's character
[0:15:55] <%HitchhikingThrough> It's kind of surprising given how nintendo is innovative to a fault with their other projects.
[0:15:56] <%CursedNobleman> haha money printer goes BRRRRRRRRRRR
[0:15:56] <CrypticMochi> I would like to see a pokemon action rpg
[0:15:58] <%PadreHail> Pokemon is more like it's been stuck at Link to the Past and went back to Zelda 2 somewhere along the way
[0:15:59] <MasterMushin> Well good news. Seems like they're gonna go with the BOTW format for a while now.
[0:16:02] <GamecubesGiganticAButton> yeah I thought Colosseum was the future FeelsBadMan
[0:16:02] <+Dimfish> LTTP2 is god tier
[0:16:05] <DeRedBaron> its the studio owned by the pokemon company
[0:16:07] <derap41> Becaues you'll buy it
[0:16:07] <+worldbrand> He was right to exclude skyward, I know this isn't a hot take, but God
[0:16:09] <PhantomMaskJr> Well people keep buying them at that’s why the series is the why it is
[0:16:17] <%ekodrop> podcasting?
[0:16:18] <dizimous> Yea, ALBW fucks, but it wouldn't feel the same if it was the 8th if it's kind
[0:16:18] <@Solidus_113> Pokemon Colosseum changed a lot, but not enough
[0:16:20] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> a Pokemon game with every good feature from Gens 1 through 8 would be amazing
[0:16:26] <GenericSoda> Pokemon Stadium's animations still look good to this day
[0:16:31] <axelkaspar> Almost as if Nintendo believes in getting more for less and never tries to attract people with investment
[0:16:32] <Zannablu_ke> woolie is absolutely right, too bad basic ass consumers don't give a fuck too given sword and shield's incredible sales
[0:16:32] <+AJiiij> they dont
[0:16:35] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> but no, some features are "regional"
[0:16:37] <DopeyDragon> Colosseum should be what modern Pokemon games look like
[0:16:38] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Like if Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra was part of the base Sword and Shield experience, I feel like we wouldn't have half the discussions. They should have delayed Sword and Shield.
[0:16:42] <%PadreHail> Pokemon's Link Between Worlds was basically either the Black and Whites or the Gold and Silver remakes
[0:16:42] <%Mczutioni> How about a Pokemon game with any good features
[0:16:45] <%CursedNobleman> people continue to buy the same damn game! including me! LUL
[0:16:47] <cipher758> the profits don't lie. it's a shame the fans who want change have to go along with it
[0:16:48] <%Lion_kun> Fans fork out money regardless of bad game design so we keep getting trash games. Its the fans fault.
[0:16:51] <%blaze__drag> mhm I think that the thing is that they've made so much money from a formula, that they're afraid to stray from that formula and risk losing money
[0:16:53] <%SirGO0SE> @GenericSoda not compared to other franchises tbh, but compared to current pokemon games ya
[0:16:54] <%notgarza> In a way, Skyward Sword was a stepping stone in art direction for BOTW
[0:16:57] <Rhinoprotoss> Tem Tem is sorta shite
[0:16:57] <pixel_river> they should make a New drill dozer
[0:16:58] <edward11231> I just don’t like devs being called lazy :/
[0:17:08] <+AJiiij> damnit gotta go now, ENJOY THE PAPER MARIO
[0:17:10] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> The best news out of Pokemon in like a Year: Pokemon Snap 2
[0:17:10] <%Hawk_Rush> literally 20 years, jesus christ
[0:17:12] <+worldbrand> a stepping stone sure
[0:17:14] <$NoWayRyanTatum> shout outs to Kindred Spirits
[0:17:15] <%PadreHail> Pokemon Colosseum and Gale of Darkness was the farthest the series went into the right direction
[0:17:15] <glass_marcus> Skyward sword introduced stamina too
[0:17:18] <andrex2311> the Pokemon fan games and ROMs are so good it's amazing!
[0:17:19] <derap41> Why did it not come out of the gamecube
[0:17:19] <%DatAsuna> Or on the WiiU?
[0:17:20] <%arkv01> I think there's something fucked up about game freak's company structure
[0:17:21] <%Hawk_Rush> why was it never on the DS???
[0:17:21] <+JoeCoolMaverick> The thing with Pokemon Snap 2, at least they have 893 Pokemon to work with now...
[0:17:23] <%Hawk_Rush> 3DS???
[0:17:24] <DopeyDragon> Why wasn't it on Wii U?
[0:17:25] <%jinking79> it more sad that Pokken has better online than Smash
[0:17:25] <rosemon5001> thats why its easier to be a digimon fan the games are almost allways great
[0:17:25] <%arkv01> like they are way too understaffed
[0:17:29] <Potatoidea> The original didn't do well, right?
[0:17:29] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:17:32] <+TQuick101> oh no he gone

[0:17:44] <rubbishbinge> Gotta push Pokemon Channel
[0:17:44] <%YakumoYomi> To be fair: the people at the top don't care, because Pokemon sells on brand alone. The bulk of the money comes from merchandising, and most of the money goes back into merchandising. The games are just vehicles for the merchandise at this point.

[0:18:10] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth Collection is an AMAZING game, on Switch now, and everyone who is disappointed about Pokemon should try it.
[0:18:10] <+GreenCMD> woolie says Nintendo should release games sooner just after saying he doesn't care when a game comes out?
[0:18:10] <antyriku2> the 3ds wouldve been prime pokemon snap material
[0:18:10] <+linSP> PSP 3?
[0:18:13] <+terraspan> would have saved it
[0:18:14] <leroypi> Woolie they just didn’t have the right controller
[0:18:15] <%YakumoYomi> Fatal Frame 5 worked well with the Wii U, so I feel Pokemon Snap would have as well.
[0:18:17] <%ividboy> I love how he just chucked it
[0:18:21] <%arkv01> yeah gamefreak's got weirdass execs probably
[0:18:25] <%Pinkiefan> Truth
[0:18:26] <%wibbwobbler> too little too late. nothing different from the last one
[0:18:27] <+Grayhammatter> cybersleuth is amazing
[0:18:27] <%Ancopro> nintendo: yea pokemon snap 2 whatever BUT UNITE THO
[0:18:29] <%SirGO0SE> GOTTA HAVE A CAFE GAME
[0:18:29] <@Menitta> My take is the 1% is ruining Pokemon
[0:18:30] <@Solidus_113> there were Snap minigames in Sun and Moon
[0:18:31] <+worldbrand> The wii, 3DS, wii u and switch are all perfect platforms for snap 2
[0:18:32] <nyacoo> Pokemon's going to sell despite that attitude
[0:18:32] <+thunka10> probably
[0:18:33] <Gawayne2> League of Legendaries
[0:18:39] <Prevot> remember the Pokemon Company president was the dude who thought the Switch would fail
[0:18:40] <edward11231> That’s the issue.
[0:18:43] <Zayasu> and it shouldnt have been made by tencent LUL
[0:18:45] <+OUTheTeam> i think the staff actually cares. the game directors have been holding it back going by the interviews they have
[0:18:46] <+JBW00dward> Based off of Japanese Corporate Culture, I would assume it's the big heads that just want to print money and the development team are stuck doing the scraps
[0:18:48] <jjcrow21> pokemon league
[0:18:52] <+feign___> they care, but they care about the region world-building over the game itself. And that's why I still enjoy the games, but for very different reasons than early games, which were actually focused on gameplay. The DLC is promising, though, since it's a new director
[0:18:55] <%blaze__drag> the spinoffs are always the best
[0:18:56] <Potatoidea> Does this mean there'll be a Pokemon BR eventually?
[0:18:58] <bluebubblegum88> omg my bf has Woolies shirt 😂😂
[0:19:00] <%FadingEmber> I'm too burned out to care LUL
[0:19:01] <GenericSoda> Wooluigi
[0:19:03] <%jiggy_snipe> well Nintendo is notoriously late with stuff, they just now are allowing other people to mess with their ips
[0:19:03] <JetpackMcQuack> Seems the gates finally opened after pokemon go took off
[0:19:05] <archnme> countdown to pokemon auto-chess
[0:19:05] <%HitchhikingThrough> yeah that's alright
[0:19:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> I've been asking that since 2013 man
[0:19:08] <%Wool> CORGI NAMED DIO
[0:19:09] <%PadreHail> "WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS FRANCHISE TO PUSH IT FORWARD" "WE GOT TOO MANY POKEMON CUT SOME OUT AND PUT EM BACK IN VIA DLC"
[0:19:10] <%Hawk_Rush> DIO PogChamp
[0:19:10] <%SirGO0SE> Twins dating? OH NO

[0:19:15] <+Loinclothiclese> Twincest?
[0:19:16] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Somebody at Namco Bandai fought for Pokken Tournament. Namco Bandai cared more about Pokken than the Pokemon Company ever did...
[0:19:17] <jjcrow21> Ho ho
[0:19:17] <$BallerSwagBro9k> KONO DIO DA
[0:19:18] <Prevot> twincest?
[0:19:21] <%Lion_kun> Digimon has the bad tri moves but now we have cybersleuth and the amazing reboot
[0:19:21] <+Grayhammatter> kono dio da
[0:19:22] <Solidnick18> happy birthday
[0:19:28] <edward11231> I hope. Because there’s no doubt that there’s developers in the team want to do cool thing but can’t cuz of the higher ups wanting to keep things safe
[0:19:28] <%YakumoYomi> KONO CORGI DA!
[0:19:29] <%HitchhikingThrough> Hi I'm Pat

[0:19:36] <Papa_Bearman> The trick is you get married on your birthday so you never forget your anniversary.
[0:19:39] <dizimous> Atlus hates money, but gamefreak hates money and cool ideas
[0:19:40] <%PadreHail> "DO WE ADD ANY MORE MECHANICS?" "THE POKEMON GO BIG NOW" "HELL YEAH SHIP IT"
[0:19:41] <%jinking79> ppl still waitin on mother

[0:20:25] <PhantomMaskJr> majinoHorror_HF dats crazy
[0:20:33] <glass_marcus> Half your age times two + seven seconds

[0:20:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> I was born a Sunday at 2:26 PM
[0:20:47] <%YakumoYomi> @dizimous I don;t know about the cool ideas part, considering GameFreak made stuff like Giga Breaker Alt and Little Town Hero (not great, but still full of cool ideas)
[0:20:47] <Chimeraelite> oh jesus
[0:20:52] <Solidnick18> @PhantomMaskJr butts
[0:20:55] <%zamzoph> because FMA is good
[0:20:55] <Chimeraelite> I mean FMA is quality
[0:21:00] <+Dimfish> its been coming up a lot because FMA is good shit
[0:21:00] <armchairmaster_> Solomon Grundy, born on a Mundy.
[0:21:07] <+worldbrand> despite the clear quality drops, there are hundreds of thousands of people who don't care
[0:21:12] <+GreenCMD> why is FMA brought up every stream??
[0:21:13] <%SirGO0SE> same
[0:21:18] <glass_marcus> Berserk is that anime
[0:21:22] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh right woolie still hasn't read FMA:B
[0:21:25] <%ekodrop> ippo is trash now
[0:21:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @greencmd ALL IS ONE, AND ONE IS ALL
[0:21:28] <%HitchhikingThrough> *watched FMA:B
[0:21:28] <%SirGO0SE> right to the hawk fight
[0:21:28] <%Lion_kun> Fire Force
[0:21:32] <%Aruist> Hey chat, what chapter are we going into?
[0:21:33] <rubbishbinge> LET'S GO SENDO
[0:21:34] <%krispen_wa> The biggest mistake i made was reading the HxH manga after the anime
[0:21:38] <Chimeraelite> Don't worry about Berserk. You'll catch up eventually
[0:21:38] <%gatorafan> @greencmd equivalent exchange
[0:21:39] <%GrassCannon> I did that with Kaguya-sama
[0:21:42] <%Jonny_Uppercut> That's how I felt with Baki
[0:21:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> @aruist 3 hopefully
[0:21:43] <Solidnick18> i started with the old anime berserk
[0:21:44] <%wibbwobbler> TPcrunchyroll
[0:21:47] <jjcrow21> Beastars
[0:21:48] <%zamzoph> every LN-based anime ever
[0:21:53] <+Baekon01> Akira
[0:21:54] <shameimarusen> Trigun Kreygasm
[0:21:54] <TheMrRental> The wait on HxH manga now that I'm caught up is killer
[0:21:56] <DopeyDragon> You read the One Piece manga then ignore the anime except for the music LUL
[0:21:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:57] <Run44forrest> @aruist inbetween 2 and 3 i think
[0:21:58] <andrex2311> Airgear
[0:22:03] <PhantomMaskJr> Get on the boat Woolie thuluENG
[0:22:08] <rosemon5001> TRIGUN uhnGun uhnGun uhnGun
[0:22:10] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Yeah, the Trigun anime went a completely different direction than the manga.
[0:22:11] <%SirGO0SE> boomer weeb gang
[0:22:16] <dreamfillah> Hellsing Ultimate so much better
[0:22:17] <+Cavumentum> I did it with Dorohedoro, I feel like I had the rare experience of starting with the manga for Berserk
[0:22:17] <shameimarusen> Back when anime was badass
[0:22:18] <+JBW00dward> Trigun for me as well!
[0:22:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hellsing Ultimate Abridged is great
[0:22:20] <%jepupu> jepupu subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! woolieACCIDENT
[0:22:20] <armchairmaster_> Hajime no Ippo fucking burned out, Berserk will be done just SLIGHTLY before Game of Thrones gets wrapped up, followed by HxH: Final.
[0:22:21] <dreamfillah> it's so well produced
[0:22:22] <+Loinclothiclese> woolie wtf man Brotherhood is the shit
[0:22:22] <@Solidus_113> just watch Abridged
[0:22:22] <%jinking79> bunch of Jump mangas
[0:22:26] <Iam_Dead> when will we get the shaman king hype we deserve
[0:22:30] <eldragon_1> Hellsing Ultimate is pretty great
[0:22:32] <%wibbwobbler> im very picky with anime, trigun is dope
[0:22:33] <%notgarza> Boat flashbacks
[0:22:36] <%Aruist> Oh damn we going into the best chapter
[0:22:36] <+Dimfish> hellsing ultimate is fucking incredible
[0:22:37] <+spinalwizard> Surprise! Nazis!
[0:22:39] <%DatAsuna> and then we don't
[0:22:41] <+Dimfish> it blows FMAB out of the water
[0:22:42] <VHGS> @TheMrRental those 10 chapter drops are dope when they happen though
[0:22:43] <DopeyDragon> @iam_dead new anime soon bro
[0:22:43] <%heartlesshealer> That reminds me, how was Blood Trinity after the new author took over?
[0:22:45] <%DatAsuna> One day I will finish UQ holder
[0:22:46] <derap41> Just watch Team 4 stars version its better
[0:22:46] <TheMrRental> Also any Berserk fans in chat, do yourself a favor and buy the deluxe volumes. They are great.
[0:22:55] <%HitchhikingThrough> Didn't the original Hellsing not have the Nazi's?
[0:23:05] <Prevot> these days I always find out about the manga before it gets adapted
[0:23:07] <+JBW00dward> Bleach, Trigun, and Rurouni Kenshin were all Animes that I went to read the Manga afterwards
[0:23:19] <%krispen_wa> how can you have hellsing without nazis? murdering nazid is like half the appeal
[0:23:20] <glass_marcus> Anime is just a 23 minute ad for the manga
[0:23:22] <BearSawed> og hellsing had mechanically made vampires
[0:23:26] <Run44forrest> berserk ended when shierk got introduced hggFeelspiccoloman
[0:23:31] <%jinking79> Jojo up their for some
[0:23:40] <dundunsun> That “oh shit there’s actually more” feeling is so good
[0:23:41] <Byr0nX> waazup chunky boyz
[0:23:42] <Iam_Dead> @dopeydragon ye. but we gotta get more people hype about it.
[0:23:42] <%YakumoYomi> I shudder to think what would have happened if I didn't jump into the Shaman King manga after watching the anime. The anime ending was really underwhelming.
[0:23:44] <muniea3> you NEED double glazing
[0:23:44] <%MTLer> as a basement dweller I know my of these windows you speak
[0:23:48] <%zamzoph> my apartment has bad sound insulation that makes me concerned about TV volume monkaS I got a warning for watching Redline after quiet hours
[0:23:51] <%MTLer> know not*
[0:23:57] <BearSawed> like micro chips turned people into vampires
[0:23:57] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:24:00] <+spinalwizard> The nazi reveal hadn't happened yet
[0:24:52] <armchairmaster_> Oh
[0:25:00] <extradopeness> Yeah I just kinda use headphones all the time because sound issues at my apartment
[0:25:00] <%kyh9> ARMS does a lot of work to make it so attacks take up a HUGE amount of screen space comparable to anime fighters or the like
[0:25:04] <%wibbwobbler> KappaHD
[0:25:05] <milhousego> what color do ya'll think the partner in chapter 3 will be once it hatches?
[0:25:17] <BearSawed> do you remember my favorite things Ive killed? 3rd is the turks, 2nd is the nazis
[0:25:19] <GenericSoda> hey keep it down will ya
[0:25:19] <%zamzoph> @spinalwizard it's weird to think that the original anime didn't have them at all when they're such a big part of the story
[0:25:22] <baconifier> do not
[0:25:29] <Mandrake9000> First Woolie stream after the end of the best friends. Took me long enough but I'm here now for that chill Woolie energ
[0:25:30] <Prevot> LUL
[0:25:33] <%Druuplays_> @milhousego spoils DansGame
[0:25:34] <andrex2311> LUL
[0:25:35] <Run44forrest> @milhousego black
[0:26:01] <%Druuplays_> @milhousego but I’m calling pink
[0:26:03] <%SirGO0SE> GET GOOD
[0:26:05] <%jiggy_snipe> Dark Souls 2 mainly I think
[0:26:07] <Prevot> dark souls has so much auto tracking, it's fucking garbo
[0:26:08] <andrex2311> LUL
[0:26:11] <%krispen_wa> DS2 enemy tracking WutFace
[0:26:14] <@Solidus_113> fuck those turtle knights
[0:26:15] <%starzo0> i love the spin
[0:26:18] <hunterqrow> Yo
[0:26:19] <eldragon_1> yeah thats DkS2
[0:26:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Flowcharting has obvious counters in tekken too
[0:26:25] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:26:31] <%PadreHail> I've been playing Jedi Fallen Order and the tracking in that is SO FUCKING AGGRESSIVE
[0:26:36] <Daniel_Is_I> Tracking overheads bruh
[0:26:39] <Run44forrest> better yet what will its name be chat?
[0:26:46] <Prevot> one thing I loved about Monster Hunter was how there wasn't too much tracking and your positioning matters SO MUCH
[0:26:46] <hunterqrow> how is everyone
[0:26:47] <andrex2311> in real life, you spin in place?
[0:26:47] <+worldbrand> ive kinda never minded that, it's the delays the fuck me
[0:26:56] <%MTLer> so I can't hadouken IRL if I do qcf motion?
[0:26:56] <%wibbwobbler> ultra combo irl
[0:27:00] <+spinalwizard> @zamzoph Right? and their answer was..."Incognito?" The first anime had a real problem with people not finishing sentences.
[0:27:07] <%DappercatEsquire> squared circle*
[0:27:08] <%SirGO0SE> video game fighting would be more realistic if after 1 hit your screen started blacking out and you cant breath irl
[0:27:09] <TheMrRental> USFIV is really fun to watch because of footsies, at least for me. Rewatching Bonchan vs Alex Valle never fails to generate hype.
[0:27:15] <glass_marcus> Earth Bending
[0:27:15] <%PadreHail> Do KoF inputs irl to find the clitoris
[0:27:18] <andrex2311> real life tracking overheads
[0:27:19] <hunterqrow> what are we talking about
[0:27:21] <milhousego> so how far are we in the game?
[0:27:21] <%Proxzo> uni500 Hey Woolie, hope you're enjoying your time as the Plumber of Dojima. This LP is the highlight of my week. Wanted to give you a tip: Invest in the mouse early (3 x100g).

[0:39:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @nocturne_reverie
[0:39:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Seems like loading the next area's textures causes a lot of lag.
[0:39:41] <+Hobojo153> Textures?
[0:39:42] <%Ancopro> Hd button off?
[0:39:42] <@akuda_bar> Just turn down the settings on the Gamecube...

[0:40:06] <%Ancopro> that sound was only fucked when it slowed down
[0:40:07] <Daniel_Is_I> The audio was fine when it wasn't loading textures.
[0:40:07] <%prime_name> I think its just the pipes causing the chonky audio.
[0:40:09] <%SomersaultJustice> we hardly knew ye, HD Gamecube
[0:40:13] <darkmaster2001> Fraud detection averted
[0:40:15] <muniea3> blow on the disc

[0:40:25] <+nocturne_reverie> it seemed to just be during screen loading
