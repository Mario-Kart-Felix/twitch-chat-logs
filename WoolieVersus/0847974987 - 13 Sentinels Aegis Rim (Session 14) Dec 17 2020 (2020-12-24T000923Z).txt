[0:21:05] <Blank9> wait for that switch pro
[0:21:07] <%JustYudha> Moneys?
[0:21:17] <Bluewolf544> What game chat ?
[0:21:20] <corinv> It's an autorunner
[0:21:24] <%X2Eliah> cyberpunk
[0:21:24] <tortiqua> it's a runner
[0:21:26] <%SkellyVee> waoPog waoPog waoPog waoPog waoPog
[0:21:29] <tortiqua> looks like shit
[0:21:30] <+call_me_rock> its suppose to be a on rails platformer
[0:21:31] <%JustYudha> It's a traditional Meatboy game
[0:21:35] <%Theycallmenerf> @writebroalpha Which part? I’m only on Part 3 currently.
[0:21:37] <+call_me_rock> its not traditional
[0:21:40] <+call_me_rock> its a runner
[0:21:40] <%JustYudha> I's like Mario Mobile
[0:21:44] <+call_me_rock> button press
[0:21:52] <theredfox930000> is wollie sitting next to nathan drake
[0:22:01] <%X2Eliah> Ah, n+, from the era of newgrounds and flash games...
[0:22:02] <tortiqua> the graphics somehow looks worse than the original
[0:22:11] <%d1stantutopia> @Theycallmenerf mid-way through a fight in part 6, the antagonist stops the fight with the non-sequitur "I respect the first person to have eaten a mushroom."
[0:22:24] <%thedankestmeeme> Thats Compton Unchartered
[0:22:32] <%Theycallmenerf> Ah I can’t wait to get there! @writebroalpha
[0:22:35] <+CreggaMonsta> you all get the snow storm in canada. we gettin in New England
[0:22:39] <%osaka_daioh> yeah that's pretty true
[0:22:44] <+cvp5127> fuck the ocean
[0:22:44] <pjbuster> goblin sharks are enough
[0:22:45] <%linSP> play end is nigh for that OG super meatboy platforming action
[0:22:47] <%jiggy_snipe> that's why humans are going to space cuz we fear the deep sea
[0:22:47] <%d1stantutopia> @Theycallmenerf Also, I hope you're enjoying JoJo, Part 3 is good but Part 4 is for me where it really elevates to something truly great
[0:22:53] <Pyrrhus90> DO NOT WAKE UP CTHULU
[0:22:59] <Bluewolf544> subnautica represents tthat
[0:23:02] <%X2Eliah> Dude 95% of the ocean is a lifeless desert
[0:23:02] <%CavemanInCave> wake our lord
[0:23:04] <%kyh9> YOU THINK SPACE ISNT SCARY
[0:23:06] <%kyh9> SPACE IS MORE SCARY
[0:23:10] <MyNameIsRasus> MOST JUSTIFIED BITCH MOVE EVER
[0:23:12] <+MetroidPrimeRib> how is space not terrifying
[0:23:12] <Zeif00> we don't want to know the truth
[0:23:16] <pjbuster> look we have learned enough reggie
[0:23:17] <%Asuterisuku> Part 3 is the most boring.
[0:23:23] <Bluewolf544> Space is pretty spoopy as well
[0:23:28] <%d1stantutopia> Do we know what caused The Bloop yet? No? Still guessing Cthulhu then
[0:23:28] <%kyh9> NOTHINGS MORE SCARY THAN BEING ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE
[0:23:28] <+MetroidPrimeRib> just like deep ocean you're surrounded by instant inescapable death
[0:23:30] <theredfox930000> fuck the ocean
[0:23:31] <MyNameIsRasus> OH YEAH?
[0:23:31] <%osaka_daioh> OUT THERE, OUT WHERE THE SKY IS OCEAN BLUE
[0:23:32] <alrobot2014> @kyh9 yeah but the ocean is closer so scariness by proximity
[0:23:33] <%kyh9> EXISTENTIAL DREAD
[0:23:34] <+chiazam> We dont know whats at the bottom of the ocean
[0:23:34] <+ManOfReason> "there's some weird shirt down here, fuck that" -some scientist probably
[0:23:44] <%CavemanInCave> cant see a black hole coming
[0:23:45] <OblivionSword1> not yet anyway
[0:23:45] <%jiggy_snipe> space is completely unknown, deep ocean is kinda known and we don't like it
[0:23:49] <%d1stantutopia> @Asuterisuku There's no such thing as a boring JoJo part. Part 5 is my least favourite and I still love it dearly.
[0:23:50] <%Theycallmenerf> @writebroalpha The Progression of Hampn in Part 1 to Part 2 was probably my favorite part but Part 3 introducing Stands is super interesting too, my favorite fight so far was Hanged Man.
[0:23:52] <%ChoculaUltra> man, there are irl raid bosses lurking in the Mariana's Trench
[0:24:11] <MyNameIsRasus> Literal Kraken looking motherfuckers
[0:24:12] <%JustYudha> It's cooler to say you died in space than on Earth
[0:24:13] <%Theycallmenerf> @writebroalpha Sorry, Hamon*
[0:24:15] <Equirah> time is the final frontier
[0:24:16] <%X2Eliah> So, you know how we only see most asteroids when they fail to hit the earth?
[0:24:18] <%kyh9> @alrobot2014 I might rise back to the surface if I'm in the ocean, I'm not falling back to earth and surviving
[0:24:21] <Bluewolf544> Youtube clip time PogChamp
[0:24:29] <MyNameIsRasus> We think we do at least
[0:24:30] <+CreggaMonsta> yooo that mug reggie
[0:24:37] <%Asuterisuku> J. Guile is a pretty good fight, yeah.
[0:24:46] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[0:24:46] <+MetroidPrimeRib> counterpoint- solar flares, black holes, radiation poisoning, the deimos
[0:24:47] <%linSP> ocean has fog of war but you KNOW things are in there
[0:24:48] <+TheLastStar> LUL
[0:24:50] <DXLelouch24> You are a dumbass and arrogant as fuck if you think no one else is out there
[0:24:50] <%d1stantutopia> @Theycallmenerf Ayy, Hanged Man is great. Dropping Hamon for Stands was where it stopped being a campy Fist of the North Star clone and started coming into its own, but Parts 1 and 2 are still banging
[0:24:52] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:24:55] <pjbuster> I can't wait to pilot our gundams in space
[0:24:55] <%emperordread> There's a skull above everything's head
[0:24:57] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:24:57] <%osaka_daioh> that's true! IF we attack we will LOSE

[0:25:00] <Tuna_Can_0> emerald weapon monkaS
[0:25:03] <%ChoculaUltra> Skulls instead of their level over their heads monkaS
[0:25:06] <MyNameIsRasus> The Mariana Trench is the Ultima Dungeon
[0:25:07] <Bluewolf544> High level shit
[0:25:20] <%SkellyVee> waoPog waoPog
[0:25:27] <%kyh9> WHAT
[0:25:28] <%Asuterisuku> Part 2 Joseph remains my favorite JoJo.
[0:25:31] <%X2Eliah> No but everything in the deep ocean can be defeated with GUN. Space hazards, not a chance
[0:25:33] <mortificent> fucking Emerald Weapon down there
[0:25:34] <HollowMan190> it might be worse
[0:25:35] <%kyh9> WHY WOULD SPACE MONSTERS BE CLOSER TO YOUR LEVEL?!
[0:25:36] <%d1stantutopia> Atlantis is the multiplayer-only raid dungeon, and humanity doesn't have any allies for player 2 yet
[0:25:39] <%Klefth> Or it's just way too much fucking pressure, period...
[0:25:40] <%osaka_daioh> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:25:41] <+CreggaMonsta> omg chat your not going to believe this
[0:25:42] <%ChoculaUltra> end dungeon is the starting dungeon the whole time
[0:25:42] <MyNameIsRasus> FARM ALIENS FOR OCEAN EXP
[0:25:44] <%kyh9> SPACE MONSTERS ARE GOING OT BE WAY HIGHER LEVEL
[0:25:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:25:46] <Bluewolf544> USE MECHA TO FIGHT THE SHARKS
[0:25:47] <%emperordread> I am satisfied with this response, thank you
[0:25:47] <smyld> Deep blue sea is the real bloody palace
[0:25:47] <SomersaultJustice> it's the hidden optional boss
[0:25:49] <+MetroidPrimeRib> giants deep in outer wilds is both terrifying space and scary ocean at the same.time
[0:25:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's when we find the great ones
[0:25:55] <mass1997> just like x com
[0:25:55] <+TheLastStar> the ocean is a fog door LUL
[0:26:00] <+CreggaMonsta> the hate avenger twitch adds
[0:26:00] <%Stormzcales_Lair> because at that point, we would be space level
[0:26:07] <Pyrrhus90> farm exp in space
[0:26:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Water is just liquid fog
[0:26:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Deep Ocean is the super dungeon in JRPGs that you avoid until you're at the final boss, then you go back to it and get floored by the first mini-boss LUL
[0:26:12] <alrobot2014> the ocean is gouto waiting at 14%
[0:26:18] <Tuna_Can_0> I hope in the remake, emerald weapon chases you :)
[0:26:24] <%osaka_daioh> shit man
[0:26:25] <+MetroidPrimeRib> dsp wins again
[0:26:27] <%jiggy_snipe> DarkSydePhil isn't dumb
[0:26:29] <%ChoculaUltra> Deep Ocean is the bonus dungeon that comes out in the re-release
[0:26:30] <Solidnick18> huh
[0:26:39] <%BlueJoneleth> he made a video back then
[0:26:39] <Zeif00> DSP does it again
[0:26:40] <mortificent> Emerald Weapon always scared the shit out of me
[0:26:41] <%SjoeB89> A broken clock is right twice a day
[0:26:42] <corinv> I def do not remember that lol
[0:26:44] <@akuda_bar> dsp tries it
[0:26:47] <SomersaultJustice> we need a picture of DSP in congress
[0:26:47] <drk_sd> dsp is a 4 time professional figthting gamer
[0:26:55] <OblivionSword1> I wouldn't be surprised
[0:26:57] <%Asuterisuku> Wouldn't know it from watching him, Jiggy.
[0:27:01] <%Theycallmenerf> @writebroalpha I thought Part 1 was super campy then I decided to watch the dub and was very happy seeing Johnny Yong Bosch as Jonathan Joestar. Part 2 Joseph Joestar is still my favorite and Part 3 Joseph Joestar is still up there too. Polanerf is cool.
[0:27:02] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus it was for me i signed a petition for it to get filibuster because he was talking about it
[0:27:05] <OneSassyMoogle> They recently put Emerald Weapon into FF14 and it's rad as hell kupo
[0:27:11] <goroke> ITS SENTINEL TIME BABY
[0:27:17] <%X2Eliah> Damn, called out hard
[0:27:19] <@akuda_bar> can't tell you if it's true because you couldnt pay me to watch dsp
[0:27:21] <Bluewolf544> Reminder that dsp defeated sbfp
[0:27:34] <+MetroidPrimeRib> dsp will be president in 2032
[0:27:35] <T_Sasquatch> ( X ) DOUBT
[0:27:38] <%Spydurman> @WoolieVersus during Twitch Town Hall they said that law isn't for Streamers but for sites. You won't get a felony
[0:27:43] <MyNameIsRasus> OBJECTIVE TRUTHS TIME
[0:27:44] <@akuda_bar> d o u b t
[0:27:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Why the hat and scarf guys? XD
[0:27:46] <+MetroidPrimeRib> the man cant lose
[0:27:47] <Bluewolf544> Big doubt
[0:27:56] <%SjoeB89> THE EFF and FSF is what got a lot of people into that
[0:28:00] <coldhyacinth> Y'all are rad excited to see you continue this game
[0:28:01] <%ChoculaUltra> its a hat and scarf kinda day
[0:28:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Canada winters are cold man
[0:28:15] <%d1stantutopia> @Theycallmenerf Part 1 is rough going for some; I've had to sit and watch it with friends to get them through it, but watching Part 1 provides a lot of context for a BIG payoff in Part 3
[0:28:18] <%X2Eliah> Woolie no stop overcomplicating, real life is never complicated or context dependent
[0:28:23] <goroke> it's so weird Emerald Weapon was based off Quelby from Zeta and then Emerald weapon influenced Kshatriya
[0:28:26] <%d1stantutopia> @Theycallmenerf And yeah, Part 2 Joseph is glorious
[0:28:29] <%Livelinne> Yeah sign Fight for Future's petition
[0:28:30] <%ChoculaUltra> did Canada get hit by that Northeastern snow storm that just passed through? NY is covered in like a decent foot of snow
[0:28:44] <%Chatterbox1991> there was a documentery series about Sopa and Pipa that wanted to reach out to him to get his take on it because apparently he was a huge influence on combating it, however much that means
[0:28:48] <%SkellyVee> part 6 <3
[0:28:51] <%Chatterbox1991> apprentlym
[0:28:57] <%d1stantutopia> Part 8 best Part!
[0:29:01] <Bluewolf544> Part 7 is where its at lets be honest
[0:29:04] <T_Sasquatch> Part 7 tho
[0:29:05] <%CavemanInCave> iron nut roll
[0:29:10] <%TubeMan642> FF is best Jo girl
[0:29:16] <%d1stantutopia> New chapter this week, VERY HYPED
[0:29:20] <%Asuterisuku> Can't wait to see the objectively best part, Steel Ball Run.
[0:29:28] <%jinking79> Part 8 not done yet hold your horses
[0:29:29] <mortificent> Part 6 news on March, wasn't it??
[0:29:31] <ColbyBryant> Part 6 never

[0:30:03] <+Asuterisuku> LUL
[0:30:03] <%d1stantutopia> Part 8 has been in a constant state of popping off for like 14 months straight now
[0:30:05] <%osaka_daioh> OR MAYBE
[0:30:06] <%d1stantutopia> barring hiatuses
[0:30:07] <%jiggy_snipe> insert Charlie from IASIP gif
[0:30:12] <%Livelinne> woolieSMUG_SA woolieSMUG_SA woolieSMUG_SA
[0:30:13] <+MetroidPrimeRib> heed the words of the woolie of 2188
[0:30:17] <jubejube56> Okay but what if hippos
[0:30:18] <%X2Eliah> What even is a year
[0:30:19] <Tuna_Can_0> BUT PEPE SILVA
[0:30:24] <%osaka_daioh> Okay BUT WHAT. IF.
[0:30:28] <Bluewolf544> Part 6 is totally already confirmed isnt it ?
[0:30:32] <%Asuterisuku> Wooloe's speculation is the best.
[0:30:42] <%Theycallmenerf> I have a friend who sends me Part 8 memes and I laugh because I don’t understand the context.
[0:30:47] <%TubeMan642> @Bluewolf544 Yasuho is good but FF is the hill I die on
[0:30:56] <extradopeness> I got the monkeys paw, lemme get part 7 anime but lose part 6
[0:31:04] <+cvp5127> the one with hat kid
[0:31:14] <Bluewolf544> @TubeMan642 Just like she did NotLikeThis
[0:31:16] <%d1stantutopia> @Bluewolf544 "No." *wink* There's a big JoJo conference in April where they will most likely announce Part 6 and introduce Jolyne's VA. I'm hoping for Miyuki Sawashiro
[0:31:29] <%ChoculaUltra> I know its pandery as hell, but I'd love a quick Giorno cameo in Part 6. Yes, I'm lame.
[0:31:34] <%Asuterisuku> We can't lose Part 6, Jolyne is so good.
[0:31:43] <%d1stantutopia> Part 6 is so underrated
[0:31:50] <Bluewolf544> Giorno cameo would fuck with the story too much
[0:31:51] <%kyh9> Sent it
[0:31:52] <%ChoculaUltra> (in the anime I mean)
[0:32:05] <%kyh9> https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1338893744213532674
[0:32:11] <%kyh9> Here it is too
[0:32:17] <%d1stantutopia> Giorno and Mista chilling in Disney World for 2 frames would sustain me, but more than that is too much, no thank you
[0:32:24] <%kyh9> Also has the hat-in-time kid
[0:32:25] <+MetroidPrimeRib> sawashiro voiced jolyne in the games
[0:32:27] <%Asuterisuku> He has a text cameo in the manga though.
[0:32:29] <+MetroidPrimeRib> shes a perfect pick
[0:32:32] <@Menitta> that fighting game you retweeted yesterday was the coolest shit
[0:32:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Yo mah boi Woolie looking FLY with that jacket wow
