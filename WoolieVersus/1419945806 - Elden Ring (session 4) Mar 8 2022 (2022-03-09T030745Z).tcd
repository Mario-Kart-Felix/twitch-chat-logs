[0:03:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> "yo it takes two keys and I HAVE TWO KEYS"
[0:03:37] <penitentpendant> That dungeon feels like a developers revenge for DS1 'always take the key starting gift' meta

[0:04:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Snoop is completing life's sidequests
[0:04:43] <MyNameIsRasus> he'll hit the other team with the boof smoke to sabotage their play
[0:04:45] <%Shad0wTag> @Irridium Okay but only because you asked nicely
[0:04:48] <+anoldtoilet> snoop streamed for like 3 weeks without audio playing games because he didnt read chat or have a guy reading it

[0:06:04] <%Shad0wTag> CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SELF BAN
[0:06:05] <+Buttlo> It's amazing how this game costs sixty bucks US and there are other games with nowhere near the amount of game that cost the same price.
[0:06:15] <leith_aziz> Your english is pretty good. Just replace "how" with "how's" pickyEZ
[0:06:17] <+Reverend_Roscoe> YOU CAN SORT?!
[0:06:21] <+Mrbaconator> they made it so the stream is in kikongo only

[0:06:42] <+feaxel> the cheats
[0:06:49] <badugidugi> While help menu is open, game is really paused
[0:06:50] <dralakbadusk> yes you can sort @akw4rd_buff4lo
[0:06:55] <@Menitta> oooh yeah if you look at the tips in the menu
[0:06:58] <+patel347> its a bug ofc but yeah
[0:07:00] <%X2Eliah> its just some exploiting of tutorial menus
[0:07:02] <@Menitta> it acts as a pause
[0:07:02] <ashenjuan25> That amount of illusory walls I‚Äôve come across give me genuine emotional damage
[0:07:04] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta WE CAN FIGHT OUT IN THE BANNED ZONE
[0:07:08] <%sewermonk> sewermonk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Elden Ring has literally made me bust out pencil and paper and start taking notes on quests and places I need to check. Really is the Morrowind of Dark Souls
[0:07:11] <MyNameIsRasus> You can pause via a bug LUL
[0:07:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[0:07:13] <%MajorCrasher> actual pause? PogChamp
[0:07:13] <leith_aziz> QA powers on standby
[0:07:15] <SainEdge> yeah, saw that tip about sorting  on reddit, didnt know until yesterday, after 70 hours of playing LUL
[0:07:23] <BlackermanZX> exploits baby
[0:07:27] <+Dakuu75> OOOHH, that was a tweet I just saw. If you hit the "help" button. on the menu and it bringes up the "explanation" window. which pauses the game
[0:07:29] <%andre11dr> It's just some exploits  it's not game altering or anything like that
[0:07:30] <+seylumie> Wow actual pause lol
[0:07:30] <dds333a> In the liminal space that is the ban zone LUL
[0:07:32] <leith_aziz> pickyLurk
[0:07:33] <+HairyWario> Elden Ring is what I wanted to mod my Skyrim to play like
[0:07:35] <%MajorCrasher> finally a qol bug
[0:07:36] <dralakbadusk> @ashenjuan25 that dungeon that is just illusion walls is some brain damage type of deal, i was done for the day lol
[0:07:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> also you can apparently check off graces on your map? idk I haven't looked into it
[0:07:48] <leith_aziz> pickyCozy
[0:07:52] <@Menitta> I'm liking ER so much, I really wanna go back and give DS3 another shot. Hell it honestly feels like retroactively, I appreciate the RPG genre more
[0:07:56] <roadwarior2> Holy crap, I went to that little area south of starting WAY too late in the game. At SL 90 it was like swatting flies.
[0:07:57] <kaydvill> i need to good luck with game  and good day
[0:07:59] <ashenjuan25> There‚Äôs a cave that‚Äôs like three walls back to back
[0:08:06] <%Artoo__The_Me> Artoo__The_Me subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Woolie, it‚Äôs been a bit for an update but I recently came back from London and am now engaged! Just wanna say thank y‚Äôall for years of content and keeping the entertainment rolling! Hope y‚Äôall keep lovin Elden Ring like I am!
[0:08:13] <MyNameIsRasus> @dralakbadusk i found two of those. i was inflicted with real life ! FRENZY !
[0:08:19] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @Artoo__The_Me  Congrats!
[0:08:21] <+Dakuu75> sometimes I have to sort by New because I forget wtf I picked up 2 seconds ago
[0:08:35] <+volitzern> I'm 120 hours in and did not know that you could sort xD
[0:08:41] <BlackermanZX> @Artoo__The_Me congrats good sir
[0:08:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wish Elden Ring had a photo mode tho NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:08:50] <+Jiggisnipe> yea you can't look at the map when aggro
[0:08:55] <@DashXero> If you're shopping too.
[0:08:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Map should've been pause fr
[0:09:01] <%Artoo__The_Me> Thank you chat!
[0:09:07] <%FugitiveJay> woolieSMUG first time in the stream and i already have a hype train conductor badge. life is good
[0:09:08] <badugidugi> It's to stop you from fast traveling out of fights
[0:09:10] <%andre11dr> Video starts "so I've grinded offscreen a little"  LEVEL 70
[0:09:11] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I've been considering maybe starting with DS1 as my 1st and then going in order. That or start with ER. The only issue is that the latter might make going backwards problematic cohhHmm
[0:09:11] <+mechslayer71> just bought the Xbox elite series 2, paddles are great for switch my gear without moving my main fingers
[0:09:14] <iacus_> souls games are technically always multiplayer, so pause shouldn't apply
[0:09:16] <OneSassyMoogle> Can't map in fights, so that makes sense kupo
[0:09:18] <%CavemanInCave> QOL
[0:09:19] <+Jiggisnipe> @badugidugi that too
[0:09:23] <LaserRamon> Wolf demands your attention
[0:09:28] <+Jiggisnipe> can't fast travel to safety LUL
[0:09:32] <%Deasmeister> They did let us pause in Sekiro
[0:09:34] <%Reveresao> Selecting help in the inventory then selecting menu explanation pauses the game. Sorry about the dono had to cut characters.
[0:09:36] <MyNameIsRasus> pupper needs snuffin
[0:09:37] <depressioncherrie> It's also super annoying when you ride around and can't check where you want to go because some guy behind a bush is aggroed
[0:09:42] <BlackermanZX> Audacity still shittin the bed huh
[0:09:47] <+feaxel> is it still dark audacity?
[0:09:48] <dds333a> @leith_aziz it won't LUL
[0:09:53] <+terry_quest> @Reveresao they are aware
[0:10:10] <dralakbadusk> my biggest sad is that i two shoted Patches ;_;
[0:10:14] <@Menitta> I've dipped into every Fromsoft game and the only one I really clicked with was Bloodborne. I think I'll like DS3 in particular because there's a lot more overlap with that one specifically
[0:10:23] <+Dakuu75> technology is jank
[0:10:34] <%andre11dr> That's AUDACIOUS
[0:10:34] <leith_aziz> I'm trying to avoid as much footage of the game as possible untill I get my hands on the game. Allthough since im waiting for improvement on PC version, my hands are tied cohhNotes
[0:10:39] <ashenjuan25> I think patches steals half your runes in stormveil
[0:10:47] <ashenjuan25> When you die
[0:10:58] <@Menitta> oh yeah I've been doing that but I only did it once lol
[0:10:59] <iacus_> Good way to put it...
[0:11:01] <%TheHateFish> @ashenjuan25 It's like 20%, and it's not Patches
[0:11:05] <+Jiggisnipe> gotta get your R.E.G. system
[0:11:05] <bamith23> Oh Woolie is here. Did anyone tell Woolie that in the inventory screen you can press L3 to sort it differently? Including by item acquisition, so you don't have to go searching through as much.
[0:11:07] <%RyTYoung> I respect all you pen and paper dudes
[0:11:09] <badugidugi> @ashenjuan25 yeah took me a while to figure out why I was losing runes
[0:11:19] <leith_aziz> I actually did try Bloodborne once, but I feel like I didnt give it a proper shot. The lack of handholding made me go in circles, not knowing how to progress
[0:11:23] <%andre11dr> Yeah, it's basically Skyrim with good combat at this point
[0:11:28] <%RyTYoung> I have went to the wiki for my npc check ups
[0:11:33] <%Shad0wTag> ENGAGEMENT POG
[0:11:36] <Afrosamasenpai> ayy you do it
[0:11:37] <Blank9> It‚Äôs so big that I kinda want to just take a break with triangle strategy
[0:11:38] <@Solidus_113> there are currently quests in the game that on one can figure out how to move them forward, it's wild
[0:11:38] <%illtima> illtima subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! What's up Woolz! Glad that you're enjoying the game. I'm 100 hours in and I THINK I finished exploring everything underground and below Atlas Plateau. I'm just now goign into the mountains. This game's scale is absurd!
[0:11:40] <leith_aziz> Congrats!  pickyYay pickyYay pickyYay pickyYay pickyYay
[0:11:43] <dralakbadusk> Elden Ring is the best game of this generation
[0:11:44] <ashenjuan25> Also you can summon patches for a boss but he just runs around and then despawns
[0:11:46] <MyNameIsRasus> put an elden ring on it
[0:11:49] <%Reveresao> @terry_quest I know. Just wanted to clear up my dono msg.
[0:11:49] <oda_flobunaga> It took me 140 hours to get the last map fragment
[0:11:52] <%CavemanInCave> wholesome woolie chibidokiPeepohappy
[0:11:53] <roadwarior2> I wish the crouch button had to be held a couple seconds before initiating. 20% of the problems I have in this game come from accidently launching myself off my horse because of it.

[0:30:59] <luftraumm1> WoolieReacts is a great format y'all could explore more
[0:30:59] <7c_nickel> I was REALLY down on elden ring at first because I bounced between like 4 of the most bullshit bosses in the entire game.

[0:31:08] <dds333a> I wonder what Woolz' thoughts were at this moment LUL
[0:31:09] <bamith23> I'm at 26 vigor now and bosses in Caelid at least take 2 shots to kill me now.

[0:31:43] <0078thunder> @bamith23 40 vigor is recommended for west caelid and later zones

[0:31:54] <%xerotwo> ALL OR NOTHING!!!!
[0:31:56] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> If only this boss was found in the open world instead of a dungeon. I think that would have made it at least a little better.
[0:32:02] <%oneimportantthing> I'm glad the health bar isn't crazy long like in DS3
[0:32:02] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:32:02] <+Amaideus> It might even be 80, I don't quite remember

[0:32:42] <MurseJOCO> Determined that it was a lie LMAO
[0:32:44] <stuffamiriteyea> it could at least have been a double KO
[0:32:46] <+Tuffty> Here I thought Reggie's choke against Manus was bad lol
[0:32:46] <mar_krow> Just got here wats going on

[0:32:48] <%xerotwo> B O T C H M A N I A
[0:32:48] <KingOfTheGeats> at least it didn't happen on a certain boss

[0:32:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> Game‚Äôs an asshole
[0:32:50] <+eanscrale> it happens, in fact it happens A LOT
[0:32:54] <Texeu> Moral damage - 1
[0:32:59] <+Amaideus> @Moguuera I traded with one of the shardbearers and their death speech fucked me out of it
[0:33:00] <jacknerik> Do the greases add more damage to a weapon or just switch the weapon's damage type?
[0:33:02] <dds333a> @tuffty "Now, you're doomed"
[0:33:12] <+Amaideus> @jacknerik Damage on top
[0:33:13] <KyberNasse> Woolie you need a heimlich maneuver for that big choke?

[0:33:22] <%FugitiveJay> @jacknerik stacks on top of physical dmg
[0:33:28] <%cubbywolf> LUL so underleveled
[0:33:40] <%RyTYoung> woolieYIKES
[0:33:46] <+Amaideus> @jacknerik Stacks on top of any damage, it's just most split weapons can't be buffed
[0:33:47] <Moguuera> no such thing as underleveled there is only undereducated
[0:33:47] <Aussie_Manny> So you can imbue your weapon with two elements? Sick.
[0:33:48] <masterofskillz1> Yeah this damage is painfully low
[0:33:49] <stuffamiriteyea> can trees even bleed?
[0:33:51] <luftraumm1> pat did it almost out the gate
[0:33:53] <+Amaideus> I found an int spear that CAN be buffed though
[0:33:54] <bamith23> Hehe, Woolie will get a rematch later anyways.
[0:34:03] <%RyTYoung> @aussie_manny yeah bleed+rot is amazing
[0:34:04] <%andre11dr> Oh someone should remind Woolie that he has the dude in the gail too
[0:34:08] <agustorm123> You can speed up a little Woolie
[0:34:14] <iacus_> it's invisible
[0:34:21] <Aussie_Manny> Scarlet Bleed. HahaThink
[0:34:25] <jacknerik> @jacknerik split?
[0:34:29] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @tuffty Except the Manus choke was deserved and was fair. This choke happened because of the super janky critical point system
[0:34:34] <%TheHateFish> @jacknerik They're a non-scaling version of the weapon buffs. Extra damage, but magic grease is flat whilst the magic buffs and infusions scale with INT. Any buff can only be applied to a weapon that just deals physical - any split damage weapon can't be buffed.
[0:34:37] <@Irridium> when I did this fight the boss bugged out and stopped moving. I absolutely take those
[0:34:38] <%andre11dr> Actually no wait he has his weapon, never mind I'm drunk

[0:38:02] <%shakespearo> I encountered suprisingly few bugs so far, except that it crashes while it loads coop sometimes (ps4)
[0:38:08] <+eanscrale> speaking of Gotz
[0:38:09] <bamith23> Its too bad Woolie already killed the boss associated with Balidd... Cause I did too, so I wanted to know what happen.
[0:38:11] <%ozzrabbit> YESSS! Best NPC I‚Äôve met so far!
[0:38:12] <+HefestoForges> too bad he has the evergaol guy down already tho

[0:38:15] <+Nyanlathotep> @WoolieVersus I broke a super lategame bosses HP by riposting to end the first phase and proccing bleed, the boss has 0 HP after the cutscene and died instantly, skipping phase 2

[0:42:22] <%shakespearo> hardcore gamer over here
[0:42:23] <velgaduere> @modsformeandyou ah, you're one of those people
[0:42:27] <+Captain_sevatar> It's a built in game mechanic. its not cheese

[0:43:17] <%shakespearo> Souls fans be like these games HAVE easy mode, it's called summons and then still act like you're wrong for using them LUL
[0:43:17] <+Mrbaconator> OK REAL TALK smoked gouda is legit the greatest cheese don't even fucking at me

[0:44:01] <bamith23> I found Pumpkin Head summon, for the lols
[0:44:03] <@Solidus_113> I'm more of a havarti guy
[0:44:07] <Frazbeee> @FrostedZaibatsu you just missed  him then lol
[0:44:08] <+ArmoredDeath> I'm a sharp cheddar kinda guy romollaPulchra
[0:44:10] <luftraumm1> PArm is the basis for top tier caccio e peppe AND carbonara

[0:44:33] <0078thunder> its still in limgrave
[0:44:33] <+Vigonept> whats the best cheese and meat for a quesadilla
[0:44:34] <jacknerik> Use a mix of American cheese for creaminess and cheddar for the flavor
[0:44:34] <+Byr0nX> crying continent
[0:44:38] <velgaduere> @modsformeandyou you might wanna go back to Dark Souls. this baby game with its focus on NPC summons is too easy for you
[0:44:45] <MyNameIsRasus> white balls
[0:44:45] <+Mrbaconator> @Menitta YO SAME it's SO GOOD
[0:44:54] <+Amaideus> Sacred Blade is so busted
[0:44:56] <luftraumm1> all cheese is good cheese, each has its apication
[0:45:00] <bamith23> Oh yeah, Woolie ever find the hidden warp pipe near the Marika church?
[0:45:01] <Moguuera> @pauperofthesouth smoked gouda gang we move

[0:45:17] <%FugitiveJay> walmart sells smoked gouda mac n cheese and lowkey its SO GOOD
[0:45:17] <+Vigonept> HOLY DIVER
[0:45:17] <modsformeandyou> Well I have beaten most bosses first try when in the other games the average was 3-5 so you are correct. Elden Ring is definitely easier. And that's WITHOUT summons.
[0:45:18] <velgaduere> @shakespearo oh no, Dark Souls is too easy for him too!!
[0:45:18] <shadowcrisis> The gouda shall set you free
[0:45:20] <DSD24> and I'm a faith build
[0:45:20] <%pauperofthesouth> @pauperofthesouth FeelsBirthdayMan
[0:45:21] <+Amaideus> It gives more AR to my weapons than my int build can put onto weapons
[0:45:22] <%cubbywolf> you got the map?
[0:45:31] <%FugitiveJay> Gouda Gang
[0:45:37] <+LaughingNaked> Yoooo, Spotify and Discord are down
[0:45:38] <+Ravenian96> Do ya'll think summons should increase boss stats like with other npcs/players?
[0:45:41] <+HefestoForges> I'm doing dex/int/fth and it's been a blast, griffith build
[0:45:42] <+Amaideus> Holy + Buff WA > my spellblade build T_T

[0:46:25] <@Irridium> yo FUCK those bears
[0:46:29] <%pauperofthesouth> help wolves
[0:46:31] <bamith23> Too bad the bear trounces the wolves.
[0:46:31] <@Menitta> those bears ain't slouches
[0:46:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> bear, every time
[0:46:36] <iacus_> Another GRRM nod
[0:46:38] <DSD24> Give you these Bear Necessities
[0:46:39] <velgaduere> @modsformeandyou just noticed you've been following for 3 days. allow me and everyone else to never take you and your elitism seriously lobosKek

[0:47:01] <%FugitiveJay> LMAO @jacknerik you  bodied em
[0:47:01] <KyberNasse> Those wind wolves are weird, only happens in starter zone
[0:47:04] <modsformeandyou> Just my opinion
[0:47:04] <+HefestoForges> blaidd like "yo stop killing my cousins"
[0:47:07] <KingKumaVT> vicekiAngy
[0:47:10] <shadowcrisis> stab it in the arse
[0:47:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Who would win? A bear-sized duck or a dozen wolf-sized horses?
[0:47:14] <%CisealNine> The wolf guy is cool. I like him.
[0:47:16] <@DashXero> Ursaring
[0:47:17] <%mr_sups> Ursaring
[0:47:18] <Afrosamasenpai> Ursaring
[0:47:18] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:47:18] <velgaduere> @modsformeandyou like jacknerik said, no one asked
[0:47:19] <+Grayhammatter> ursaring
[0:47:22] <+Vigonept> ursaluna
[0:47:24] <%okuriskyles> nailed it first try congrats
[0:47:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this thing is a sigma
[0:47:28] <@Irridium> Teddiursa into Urserang
[0:47:30] <modsformeandyou> You keep messaging me though
[0:47:31] <%shakespearo> @CanadianAnimatorGuy no matter who wins, we lose
[0:47:32] <Sopapiglobo100> cocaine bear!
[0:47:33] <@Irridium> i botched that spelling hard
[0:47:40] <velgaduere> @modsformeandyou because it's fun to make fun of elitists :)
[0:47:41] <+Byr0nX> that thing is a ligma
[0:47:42] <+cursedwithadhd> just go with the very real short-faced bear that went extinct and thank God it did
[0:47:42] <%pauperofthesouth> FeelsBadMan poor doggos
[0:47:44] <%CisealNine> This looks more like a better Dynamax for Ursaring.
[0:47:44] <glass_marcus> They actually made an evo of ursaring that is literally jus thtis bear
[0:47:44] <bamith23> I figure they're either Megalodon Bears or could be called Major and Minor Ursas.
[0:47:47] <+Das_Prints> Ursaluna now for an even bigger bear.
[0:47:49] <@Menitta> @velgaduere enough
[0:47:51] <T_Sasquatch> That's not a bear. That's a gorilla with a bear skin
[0:47:52] <@Irridium> @velgaduere relax y'all
[0:48:04] <+HefestoForges> rip last wolf
[0:48:11] <%holydeviant1> There's a lot of "factions" in this game, I've noticed
[0:48:13] <bamith23> @T_Sasquatch Apparently it might actually be Vordt from Dark Souls 3.
[0:48:19] <@Menitta> What's that new gen 7 wolf Pokemon
[0:48:20] <%cubbywolf> in the wild, wolves will harass bears and try and steal their food, but they cant beat a bear
[0:48:22] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can hop off the Torrent while moving for faster dismount
[0:48:25] <+Amaideus> It's definitely the Ape from Sekiro
[0:48:34] <+HairyWario> has woolie found the lego dimension?
[0:48:34] <DSD24> You can bear this attack
[0:48:35] <%shakespearo> nah the giants are the ape
[0:48:36] <+Amaideus> Vordt's moveset is too tied to his hammer
[0:48:37] <%FugitiveJay> Elden ring is more forgiving build wise which makes it easier than its predecessors by far
[0:48:40] <%okuriskyles> nooo the hell tunnel
[0:48:50] <@Menitta> I like how the PS5 has like several hours of capture
[0:48:51] <+Vigonept> BIG BUGS
[0:48:51] <%pauperofthesouth> üòÜ
[0:48:52] <%cubbywolf> magic ghosts
[0:48:54] <shadowcrisis> bear makes for good eats. I mean if Yogi and boo boo plan on eating me, imma eat them first
[0:48:54] <DSD24> That's BS
[0:48:55] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:48:58] <+tempestzephyr> LUL
[0:48:58] <%pauperofthesouth> you THOUGHT
[0:49:00] <%cubbywolf> he ghost teliported
[0:49:01] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[0:49:01] <Treasure_Vault> Hard confirm
[0:49:01] <+HefestoForges> they teleport, woolie
[0:49:03] <velgaduere> @Menitta @Irridium you got it hotsamO7
[0:49:04] <iacus_> "souls games are hard but fair" my ass
[0:49:05] <%holydeviant1> Yeah, these guys do have a ghosty port, but that was just a glitch
[0:49:06] <%notsoy> even not in front of an audience, QA powers
[0:49:08] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's not the teleport he's supposed to do
[0:49:09] <%IronOhki> Woolie the Tester.
[0:49:11] <+Vigonept> THAT WAS NOT A TELEPORT
[0:49:12] <Treasure_Vault> The teleport ignores y axis
[0:49:13] <+Captain_sevatar> yeah those fuckers can teleport
[0:49:13] <T_Sasquatch> Nothing personnel kid
[0:49:13] <%shakespearo> he teleported, like Whesker does
[0:49:14] <bamith23> The ghosts can indeed teleport, but they shouldn't from a fall.
[0:49:15] <luftraumm1> i'm impressed more of this shit isn't in the game
[0:49:15] <%livlinn> QA shiaHypers
[0:49:15] <+Amaideus> He zipclipped like a MM runner
[0:49:17] <Treasure_Vault> Or they just walk
[0:49:22] <SethYuikora> misty step go brrrr
[0:49:24] <+HairyWario> this dungeon is BANANAS as a first level
[0:49:27] <%wunp_fxs> eyyyyyyyyyyy
[0:49:31] <%mr_sups> I love that snap
[0:49:31] <%cubbywolf> how was that not a teleport? you can hear the teleport sound
[0:49:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:49:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> Ive died to some bugs in this game too. Like enemies climbing ladders i havent dropped
[0:49:33] <%pauperofthesouth> wolf guy so cool
[0:49:34] <leomuratore> Woolie's QA Powers are always sharp

[0:50:31] <%TheHateFish> @froduck42 Doctor Who taught me this and I'm not ashamed that meeting this dude took me on a rewatch of nuWho
[0:50:31] <%pauperofthesouth> he could have helped the battle
[0:50:39] <bamith23> Awoo
[0:50:45] <%andre11dr> I wish he had a better voice, he kinda just sounds like some dude
[0:50:49] <luftraumm1> OwO?

[0:50:55] <Ravioli_Ronin> Daryl is broken af
[0:50:56] <Frazbeee> he sounds classy
[0:50:56] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> When I saw this guy I immediately thought of the Great Shinobu Owl
[0:50:59] <+Fefe41> @Menitta I've probably said that line like 5 times because I kept hearing things I missed
[0:51:00] <MyNameIsRasus> @andre11dr that's the best part
[0:51:00] <%holydeviant1> I actually really like this "last week in Limgrave" status report
[0:51:01] <bamith23> @andre11dr I mean I like that better since the generic one is snarls some.
[0:51:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeyeyeye
[0:51:11] <%cubbywolf> looks like woolie missed the npc
[0:51:11] <+Byr0nX> spooky

[0:51:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Limgrave Yacht Club
[0:51:20] <@Menitta> its no wonder this game took so long from reveal to release
[0:51:27] <MyNameIsRasus> you need to break their bones fairly quickly
[0:51:33] <%IronOhki> Crack their bones!
[0:51:34] <DSD24> Boney boys
[0:51:36] <+Amaideus> I love the name "Those Who Live In Death" as a flowery way of saying "Undead"
[0:51:38] <@Menitta> it's MASSIVE and still just as good as all their other stuff
[0:51:42] <+Vigonept> Break their bones
[0:51:54] <+Captain_sevatar> there is a spell that puts em down for good the first time but I think its faith based
[0:51:56] <@Solidus_113> tibia mariner!
[0:51:59] <+CrystalTree07> holy damage one taps the skellys

[0:52:22] <MyNameIsRasus> BOATMAN
[0:52:22] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> In fact I'm convinced that they've just reused that same character model and given it a new aesthetic. It wouldnt be surprising at all.

[0:55:32] <+Amaideus> Your base stamina regen is pretty fast in this
[0:55:32] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ironohki That horse combat is going to be ESSENTIAL for a certain huge boi later
[0:55:33] <+HefestoForges> no fap
[0:55:34] <MyNameIsRasus> We like the FAP
[0:55:35] <+Amaideus> But it's not bad
[0:55:35] <leomuratore> That's the item you wnated in Ds1, Reggie
[0:55:35] <bamith23> @masterofskillz1 Its primarily because stamina regen is STUPID fast in this game
[0:55:41] <Aussie_Manny> mean dog talisman
[0:55:44] <TheMadDemoknight> @zenith0111 ah, because I didn't get him yet so I didn't get all of the bits he said to avoid any late stuff
[0:55:58] <FrostedZaibatsu> So discord and spotify are down
[0:56:03] <%cubbywolf> does he find it
[0:56:04] <%cubbywolf> no
[0:56:05] <+sceptic62> Is woolie on ps5 or what
[0:56:07] <%cubbywolf> he doesnt find it
[0:56:10] <@Solidus_113> I never found this one...
[0:56:13] <velgaduere> @sceptic62 ye
[0:56:15] <%IronOhki> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Oh yes, I have used horse combat for larg bois quite effectively.
[0:56:25] <+sceptic62> I want to invade him with my cosplay vergil build but im on pc:(
[0:56:27] <masterofskillz1> @masterofskillz1 Honestly, I feel like the stamina management in this game is actually pretty easy since the harder bosses rarely let you get more than 2 swings in on any opening, so you rarely get greedy
[0:56:37] <+HairyWario> Game of Thrones violin
[0:56:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:56:47] <bamith23> Yeah horse is primarily for dragons and maybe some other people on horse who prefer hit and run attacks.

[0:57:42] <%X2Eliah> Thats super the long way to do it
[0:57:42] <exnuart> 2 heavies on the beak is instant stagger
[0:57:44] <iacus_> or just bleed them
[0:57:45] <%Reveresao> nope,  jump atk the face
[0:57:45] <iacus_> yeah
[0:57:48] <+HefestoForges> you can also cut the tentacussies
[0:57:50] <MyNameIsRasus> once you get a posture break, you can basically stunlock them
[0:57:50] <+badhaye> just jump attack the head and you're fine
[0:57:52] <%X2Eliah> faster to just run up to face and hit the beak
[0:57:55] <%MajorCrasher> magic makes these things a joke
[0:57:56] <+Captain_sevatar> bleed is super strong
[0:57:57] <bamith23> Or just hit them, lol

[1:01:59] <KaijuUltimax> She can't handle guard counters or jump attacks it's funny as hell
[1:02:02] <%TheHateFish> It's technically a greataxe
[1:02:06] <valriot> Its actually regarded as a Greataxe LUL

[1:03:00] <%cubbywolf> must get purple item
[1:03:01] <%holydeviant1> Mildred went pan, no longer just after men
[1:03:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sometimes the "important" items are just crafting garbo
[1:03:13] <%shakespearo> I have been avoiding caelid for like 60 hours now because it's so awful lmao
[1:03:16] <DancesWitBalrog> Caelid is terrifying and I love it
[1:03:19] <+Captain_sevatar> theres a story there
[1:03:24] <iacus_> Glad that woolie learned to love the crafting
[1:03:27] <bamith23> Woolie getting his chef hat

[1:03:40] <emmyD8> easy greasy
[1:03:46] <iacus_> it solves a big design issue with other Souls
[1:03:47] <%andre11dr> He never went to the side
[1:03:49] <%cubbywolf> i died trying to get to the bottom of this beach more times than a boss
[1:03:59] <KaiserMario> Woolie and Reggie, let's watch LUL
[1:04:05] <+HefestoForges> oh boi, gravity time
[1:04:10] <%cubbywolf> I FOUND OUT YOU TAKE LESS FALL DAMAGE OFF THE HORSE!
[1:04:13] <user_naim> Nothing sick down there at all
[1:04:17] <%cubbywolf> you take more fall damage on torrent than off
[1:04:22] <velgaduere> dog
[1:04:23] <%shakespearo> @user_naim yup, total snoozefest
[1:04:29] <+Perceptivecomet> I NEED the book for preserving bolluses, that area is PAIN and so are some enemies
[1:04:35] <@Irridium> cotton also just solves the fall damage problem
[1:04:42] <+Perceptivecomet> scarlet rot is awful
[1:04:45] <bamith23> @Perceptivecomet Oh I found that... somewhere.
[1:04:45] <%holydeviant1> That last-second double jump is a bad habit and does nothing for fall damage
[1:04:46] <@Menitta> Dog
[1:04:52] <velgaduere> doge
[1:04:55] <+HefestoForges> strong dog
[1:04:57] <%livlinn> kyoryuPet

[1:04:59] <%Indigo_Automaton> LUL
[1:05:00] <djblue_shift> ya like dags
[1:05:05] <+Grayhammatter> strong dog
[1:05:07] <%andre11dr> There's a spell that gives you scarlet rot btw
[1:05:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can also just jump into the wind things and take zero fall damage
[1:05:13] <+CrystalTree07> the faith spell to cure scarlet rot is invaluable
[1:05:21] <DSD24> Ah yes Naked Man
[1:05:22] <+FackinCrazy> noise does matter but you were to far
[1:05:22] <DancesWitBalrog> this guy is a chump
[1:05:23] <velgaduere> ah
[1:05:26] <velgaduere> one of these boys
[1:05:27] <%cubbywolf> he's still strong with his magic
[1:05:28] <KeiganOfAstora> Yo where we at?
[1:05:28] <%andre11dr> Gravity boy

[1:05:38] <KaiserMario> GRAVITY SQUEEZE

[1:05:38] <+mundanelotus> gravity magic looks cool
[1:05:39] <@Menitta> Is this still footage? had to step away
[1:05:40] <KingOfTheGeats> didn't know you could fight him early in limgrave
[1:05:40] <+Amaideus> Implying you aren't still at the beginning of the game :^)
[1:05:40] <%shakespearo> "at the beginning of the game" he says, as if he has seen even 5% of it LUL
[1:05:41] <bamith23> Fuckin' Woolie and his goat lol
[1:05:43] <spaghettiweaver> blood hunter sword is the new drake sword
[1:05:44] <@Irridium> that gravity move FUCKS in PvP

[1:05:54] <velgaduere> GRAVITY MAGIC YEYEYE

[1:05:56] <+Captain_sevatar> I need to go kill that guy
[1:05:58] <@DashXero> Oh my gosh. That's where we can get that!
[1:05:58] <KeiganOfAstora> I'm on episode 3 of the anime, where isi Woolie in terms of story bosses?
[1:06:01] <+mechslayer71> horseback combat just don't the samw

[1:06:07] <spaghettiweaver> @KeiganOfAstora 0
[1:06:11] <+Amaideus> @cubbywolf You can still use it without making the weapon magic
[1:06:11] <%MajorCrasher> 0
[1:06:13] <%holydeviant1> @cubbywolf good news, ashes scale differently than spells
[1:06:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> @KeiganOfAstora big fat 0
[1:06:13] <%andre11dr> Gravity spells are awesome, the meteors are rad

[1:06:42] <KeiganOfAstora> You didn't find the other torch yet?
[1:06:47] <derap41> This is a bit like watching  grandmas photo album
[1:06:48] <+Amaideus> You'll still have the WA do good damage too

[1:08:09] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> runescrape
[1:08:27] <+Captain_sevatar> the balls on this man
[1:08:36] <yukichocomilk> jumping down the spiritspring doesn't seem to work at the endgame areas
[1:08:42] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[1:08:44] <bamith23> whee
[1:08:45] <iacus_> ah i didn't find that spot
[1:08:51] <%holydeviant1> fucking neato
[1:08:53] <+Amaideus> Didn't need the double jump btw, the air swirl means you won't take fall damage
[1:08:56] <Frazbeee> can you go into the waterfall?
[1:08:58] <%holydeviant1> Torrent all like "FUUUUUUCK"
[1:08:59] <djblue_shift> oh yeah i completely misse the pad for this drop but i still got the safe land on the beach somehow lol
[1:09:00] <%cubbywolf> what an odd way to get here
[1:09:00] <%illtima> I swear to god I died a few times after jumping from those
[1:09:06] <%cubbywolf> going backwards LUL
[1:09:10] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yep, those springs also negate all fall damage if you drop onto them
[1:09:13] <bamith23> Its weird Woolie doesn't remember the slimes from other games.
[1:09:13] <%plsunbanmyacc> bro i missed so much
[1:09:16] <%andre11dr> They are weak to fire
[1:09:19] <yukichocomilk> @Indigo_Automaton not always
[1:09:29] <+Amaideus> They're weak to all elemental damage
[1:09:33] <%holydeviant1> always good to mark merchants - they all have unique stuff
[1:09:41] <+Byr0nX> seen some shit
[1:09:47] <%mr_sups> Luerentiaus
[1:09:50] <+undersea_magic> DS pyromancy trainer
[1:09:53] <+Captain_sevatar> poor guy just knows whats up
[1:10:00] <SainEdge> the dude in DS2 is like this, atleast in the begining
[1:10:07] <+Amaideus> Ya'll are thinking of the DS2 one
[1:10:10] <+Amaideus> Falkin
[1:10:13] <+Amaideus> Same VA
[1:10:14] <SainEdge> the dude in majula
[1:10:16] <%shakespearo> what exactly isa "bolus" anyway
[1:10:17] <%cubbywolf> I forget which one is stuttering
[1:10:21] <iacus_> crafting is cheaper
[1:10:28] <luftraumm1> holydeviant has some great advice, always mark your merchants
[1:10:28] <+lightbringrrrr> He sees a tarnished decked out this this on a magical steed‚Ä¶.i‚Äôd shit my pants too
[1:10:34] <iacus_> lol the book to craft them is literally there
[1:10:51] <+Amaideus> Mumbles in Sen's that sells the catarina stuff also stutters sometimes
[1:10:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:10:51] <iacus_> ah the castal cave!
[1:10:52] <%okuriskyles> a bolus is a small rounded mass of a substance, especially of chewed food at the moment of swallowing
[1:10:54] <iacus_> coastal
[1:10:54] <%holydeviant1> @shakespearo A ball-shaped medicine. Used to hae to be made before pills and such
[1:11:05] <%cubbywolf> you should mark the caves... oh
[1:11:06] <@Solidus_113> there's so much
[1:11:07] <jacknerik> @iacus_ yeah he brought it
[1:11:14] <+Amaideus> So are meatballs bolus's by definition?
[1:11:23] <bamith23> Marking off via that menu instead of a map icon is... a unique method... >_>
[1:11:32] <%okuriskyles> @Amaideus i don't see why not
[1:11:36] <ShepherdShang> Strike damage is very useful everyone
[1:11:45] <Omenaire_> fart eggs
[1:11:47] <linSP> Eat your bolus
[1:11:52] <%holydeviant1> @ShepherdShang Strike, bleed, and rot, all very useful
[1:11:54] <%shakespearo> @Amaideus they certainly cure all my ailments
[1:11:54] <bamith23> Strike damage is ncessary for some bosses/enemies in the north.
[1:12:03] <%cubbywolf> something gunna find you
[1:12:17] <%ozzrabbit> If he gets stomped, I‚Äôm going to laugh
[1:12:19] <+Byr0nX> do die in the bayou

[1:13:28] <%IronOhki> OH
[1:13:30] <Frazbeee> :)
[1:13:31] <@Irridium> twinblade's pretty good
[1:13:32] <%holydeviant1> Two chests in the Ruins, remember flks
[1:13:33] <%youngking_kush> It's a very good spell tho
[1:13:42] <%pauperofthesouth> i wants that
[1:13:44] <%livlinn> Bless
[1:13:44] <%ozzrabbit> Oh, he found the real chest
[1:13:45] <+Amaideus> I've found like, 25 spells
[1:13:50] <iacus_> i need that
[1:13:50] <yukichocomilk> twinblades are so cool
[1:13:52] <@Solidus_113> power stance twinblades let's go
[1:13:59] <%holydeviant1> @Amaideus God there's so many
[1:13:59] <+Amaideus> And of the 15ish I can use, only 2 aren't worthwhile
[1:14:01] <%youngking_kush> I never found the Twinblade, big sad
[1:14:01] <djblue_shift> coolest weapon class i'll never use
[1:14:02] <DSD24> This is the good shit
[1:14:03] <%cubbywolf> I like it but it doesn't do enough dmg
[1:14:04] <KaiserMario> At last we'll kill the Jedi, at last we will have revenge
[1:14:08] <luftraumm1> twin blades are one of the stupidest designs to come out of media, along with battle scythes
[1:14:08] <%CisealNine> The few cool things that DSII did were *really* cool.
[1:14:09] <DSD24> I've got at at Plus 13
[1:14:13] <ashenjuan25> Full helicopter man and let‚Äôs get real dumb
[1:14:14] <maskedmustelid> twin twinblades?
[1:14:15] <zenith0111> Whats twinblades advantages over other dex weapons
[1:14:22] <%FugitiveJay> btw, new prime gaming loot for lost ark as of 10mins ago
[1:14:22] <+Amaideus> Though some are VERY specific in the cases where they're good
[1:14:25] <%pauperofthesouth> @zenith0111 it looks cooler
[1:14:25] <%andre11dr> I haven't used much, i wonder if it's still kinda wack
[1:14:27] <@Irridium> @zenith0111 it looks cool
[1:14:29] <DSD24> @zenith0111 It looks cooler
[1:14:30] <justcallmebobplease> @maskedmustelid You can do that, and it works pretty well!
[1:14:30] <%holydeviant1> @maskedmustelid possible, but underwhelming

[1:14:47] <Treasure_Vault> Is the double lightsaber the coolest part of the trilogy? Or is it the only cool part?
[1:14:49] <bamith23> Game has a lot of stuff from Dark Souls 2. in fact, poison swamp ground works like in Dark Souls 2 where it sticks to your character and gradually ticks up over time.
[1:14:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> good stick
[1:14:50] <Omenaire_> magic buff

[1:18:18] <+vaderxyz1970> How long is today's stream?
[1:18:20] <zenith0111> @andre11dr You kill the chariot this way
[1:18:20] <%ozzrabbit> I can‚Äôt wait until we get around to the point where Reggie tries out DS2
[1:18:20] <+RocketBarrel> monkaS
[1:18:27] <stuffamiriteyea> i can't believe i gotta go back here a 3rd time
[1:18:28] <+Amaideus> I wonder how many weeks in a row of Elden Ring talk in the podcast will be the breaking point for people to start bitching
[1:18:30] <+Exicuren> They still are so beefy
[1:18:31] <+Amaideus> I'm thinking 2
[1:18:32] <bamith23> You can blow up the chariot in the hallways and get a Greatbow out of it.
[1:18:38] <derap41> god day sir
[1:18:39] <+solzan2000> lol
[1:18:43] <%holydeviant1> @Amaideus Two more, I bet
[1:18:46] <+twohitgood> the reward for killing them is a sense of accomplishment.
[1:18:46] <luftraumm1> does this game make prior souls games obsolete?
[1:18:46] <%cubbywolf> the feeling of a job well done
[1:18:47] <+Exicuren> Yeaj, just get the trinket and bust out
[1:18:51] <%mr_sups> Where is this?
[1:18:51] <%andre11dr> @zenith0111 I meant killing the arm dudes
[1:18:51] <%holydeviant1> The spoilercast still has to happen naturally
[1:18:53] <+Amaideus> I think it'll be this one
[1:18:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> only a lunatic would do this
[1:18:58] <%Gamefriendly> did he at least get the tallisman?
[1:19:10] <+solzan2000> @luftraumm1 no imo
[1:19:11] <KaiserMario> I killed them, with parries
[1:19:15] <+Amaideus> He got the talisman at least one session ago
[1:19:17] <%ozzrabbit> @bamith23 how? How do you destroy the chariot?
[1:19:17] <%IronOhki> @JetpackMcQuack FromSoft, I tell ya.
[1:19:21] <+Amaideus> He's had it equipped the whole time
[1:19:24] <+Jiggisnipe> @Amaideus well it qualifies as their weeks so maybe a month once alot of people beat it
[1:19:29] <bamith23> @ozzrabbit Shoot the giant jars above the path with a bow
[1:19:31] <luftraumm1> @solzan2000 probbly not for most ppl true
[1:19:36] <Treasure_Vault> This is like skyrim except the combat is good and also the point of everything you do
[1:19:46] <%cubbywolf> they aren't a boss anymore, just a regular enemy
[1:19:47] <%Gamefriendly> ah alright. im an anime watcher. popping in to see how far he got
[1:19:47] <%mr_sups> Oh there
[1:19:54] <%pauperofthesouth> big dic overhere
[1:20:10] <+Dakuu75> question: does anyone know exactl what that fire spell is, this guy uses?
[1:20:22] <luftraumm1> Cod Piece Armor lets gooo
[1:20:24] <%holydeviant1> Dragonhearted are nuts
[1:20:30] <+Nyanlathotep> @Dakuu75 I think it's Surge, O Flame?
[1:20:39] <%pauperofthesouth> dang
[1:20:42] <zenith0111> OOF
[1:20:45] <%cubbywolf> yeyeye
[1:20:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> guys I just loaded the game and died instantly :(
[1:20:47] <djblue_shift> could you imagine getting the stonesword key gift and coming here first thing
[1:20:48] <bamith23> He just a ghost, so he teleports. There is an ash of war that is like advanced quickstep that lets you turn invisible mid dash though
[1:20:48] <%andre11dr> Skyrim - dialogue + good combat = Elden Ring
[1:20:52] <+Javaa01> The strat at the beginning of the game would be to just backstab him off the ledge into the chariot
[1:20:53] <%holydeviant1> @Dakuu75 It is, you meet another one of these in the dragon cathedral
[1:20:53] <%IronOhki> That's a good halberd.
[1:21:13] <DSD24> Seong Mina's the best
[1:21:15] <%cubbywolf> so not skyrim at all but am actual good game
[1:21:16] <+Dakuu75> @Nyanlathotep  @holydeviant1 ah ok. thanks
[1:21:31] <DSD24> Plus she had a cute design in SC6
[1:21:35] <NoYOUREtheSillyGoose> Why no backstab?
[1:21:39] <%IronOhki> I've been pronouncing it "Fiz-eek" but everyone else I know says "Fiz-ick"
[1:21:39] <+orochiblood> skyrims UI/UX is so bad it requires a mod, hmmmm
[1:21:53] <%pauperofthesouth> nice
[1:21:55] <+Amaideus> Tracking in this is nuts
[1:22:02] <bamith23> I'd just pronounce it physic, physics.
[1:22:06] <+Javaa01> @orochiblood Oh absolutely, SkyUI is mandatory QoL
[1:22:08] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[1:22:14] <+Amaideus> I've had enemies leap into the air, go past me, then turn around midair without landing to still hit me
[1:22:18] <+orochiblood> @Javaa01 damn wonder why no one ever talks about it..
[1:22:44] <Aussie_Manny> Jumping heavy seems like such a good move. Always staggers.
[1:22:44] <+Nyanlathotep> @IronOhki The second is correct, but honestly who cares
[1:22:51] <+twohitgood> nice. that guy is rough.
[1:22:52] <bamith23> Now does Woolie figure out what to do...
[1:22:54] <FrostedZaibatsu> Clap
[1:23:01] <%andre11dr> It's the same sound as DS3 tho
[1:23:05] <+Amaideus> I just say Fiz-sick
[1:23:06] <zenith0111> Oh?
[1:23:06] <velgaduere> Stonesword Keys are ultra value this early in the game
[1:23:11] <Aussie_Manny> Try up
[1:23:12] <ashenjuan25> I like how in elden ring at a point you don‚Äôt need to farm upgrade material just go find the bell bearing for it
[1:23:27] <+twohitgood> the timing on this is tight. not easy to get this.
[1:23:30] <+Javaa01> @orochiblood Because it's assumed by this point, tons of other mods more or less mandate it as a prereq
[1:23:35] <@Solidus_113> I never got the timing on this
[1:23:47] <linSP> Killing that thing was so satisfying
[1:23:47] <%pauperofthesouth> the aim
[1:23:48] <velgaduere> YO
[1:23:48] <%IronOhki> @twohitgood I got the tip to do it when he crashes into your wall.

[1:25:06] <BrownMcgee> Nice welsh wolfman
[1:25:14] <PepperJam_Art> He would have
[1:25:17] <%holydeviant1> Somber stones are super good in this game, you only need one of each grade
[1:25:19] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 It would be nice if at least the first bell bearing was in fuckin Limgrave. U know, THE STARTING AREA!
[1:25:19] <+Amaideus> He even gives you an upgrade material for it

[1:26:28] <%Pillagius> Oh! Patches :D
[1:26:30] <%IronOhki> He's in this early?
[1:26:30] <+mundanelotus> Patches dipped after letting me open the chest
[1:26:33] <Aussie_Manny> chairSus
[1:26:35] <bamith23> Damn Patches and his technical correction.

[1:26:46] <+vaderxyz1970> Patches is going his own way
[1:26:48] <%youngking_kush> Blaidd is the best lol
[1:26:52] <+Brassnarwhal> his name is welsh it's pronounced Blythe
[1:26:54] <%whyskeywolfe> You're not allowed not to like him
[1:26:57] <@Solidus_113> I wonder what his moveset is Kappa
[1:26:58] <%shakespearo> @velgaduere actually it's pronounced gaskwang
[1:27:01] <%BestTeaMaker> good wolf boi
[1:27:02] <TheMadDemoknight> PROTECT my boi!
[1:27:03] <%funya_rinpa> He goes so hard when he's fighting, I love him
[1:27:05] <Arqartur0> Is Elden Ring good for a Souls noob?
[1:27:11] <FrostedZaibatsu> He aight
[1:27:15] <Gin_SXL> yes
[1:27:15] <emptyantics> HES THE GOAT
[1:27:17] <+sceptic62> Blaidd‚Äôs a simp tho
[1:27:21] <%funya_rinpa> Me too
[1:27:22] <%pauperofthesouth> @Arqartur0 def
[1:27:22] <modsformeandyou> @Arqartur0 Yes it's the easiest by far
[1:27:23] <+Amaideus> It's the easiest to recommend
[1:27:26] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 Ive been watching Plague's playthrough and he is having a nightmare trying to upgrade his gear.
[1:27:28] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Arqartur0 yes
[1:27:29] <@DashXero> Somewhat @Arqartur0
[1:27:37] <megaman_sentinel> yo later guys catch up when I get home
[1:27:39] <Aussie_Manny> To the shack! 2020Forward
[1:27:40] <+Amaideus> The hardest part is going back to old games after playing it
[1:27:40] <%townzzzzz> he doesn't know Kappa
[1:27:41] <FrostedZaibatsu> The Deviantart Shack
[1:27:42] <Johannen> Are you sure bout that painting thou
[1:27:45] <Aussie_Manny> The Mystery Shack?
[1:27:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Arqartur0 It can be the easiest or the hardest depending on how much you explore around
[1:27:47] <%okuriskyles> a painting huh woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:27:50] <LuckyTerry> What! The paintings mean something!?
[1:27:50] <@Menitta> I think it's the best game for a souls noob.
[1:27:51] <%ozzrabbit> I can‚Äôt wait till Woolie meets the other cool guy (who starts with an ‚ÄúA‚Äù)
[1:27:54] <Aussie_Manny> khadComfy
[1:27:55] <velgaduere> @shakespearo oh I thought it was "gateboss girllight gaskeep"
[1:27:57] <zenith0111> Elden Ring Kreygasm
[1:27:58] <+Amaideus> The paintings are puzzles
[1:28:00] <Deko_> that was a cool recap episode
[1:28:00] <yukichocomilk> time for painted world PogChamp
[1:28:06] <stuffamiriteyea> go back to the fog chest
[1:28:07] <%AngryAsian5> Time to ring in some eldens
[1:28:09] <%funya_rinpa> I think the game tells you to find where it was painted when you first pick it up
[1:28:09] <@Menitta> it honestly made me appreciate RPGs as a whole a hell of a lot more
[1:28:10] <Treasure_Vault> Woolie knows what paintings mean, he's played a souls dark before
[1:28:15] <+Byr0nX> last time on dbz
[1:28:26] <mihokspawn> Oh cool, I only missed the recap.
[1:28:29] <Arqartur0> Nice, it's probably gonna be my first foray, and I really want to make a melee character, I really like Sword & Board.
[1:28:30] <%notsoy> BROLEG
[1:28:32] <ashenjuan25> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy they‚Äôre mostly in mines as rewards for clearing them but some appear in some ruins but the bell bearing makes farming not needed which i‚Äôm thankful for
[1:28:34] <BlackermanZX> BROLEG!
[1:28:35] <%okuriskyles> let the salt flow
[1:28:38] <Frazbeee> did they ever finish kenneths quest
[1:28:38] <%AngryAsian5> BROLEG
[1:28:42] <zenith0111> Dual Greatswords
[1:28:43] <@Menitta> Board is good in this
[1:28:46] <modsformeandyou> Oleg = Vey easy mode
[1:28:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oleg is BIG good I love him I married him yesterday
[1:28:46] <%sherlockkat> @Arqartur0 Yes and no. THe player character is a lot more stronger and has more tools and options. But, the bosses and the mob design has also improved. You can get hardstuck at some bosses, but you can just go explore some place else. But, it's a lot more accesible than the previous games.
[1:28:49] <%AngryAsian5> BROLEG! BROLEG! BROLEG!
[1:28:49] <7c_nickel> This is the Ash Pat was talking about.
[1:28:50] <+Mrbaconator> BROLEG
[1:28:50] <justcallmebobplease> @ozzrabbit It'll be a while but I wanna see his reaction to cool guy 'R', specifically the thing.
[1:28:51] <DSD24> What a cool boy
[1:28:52] <+Grayhammatter> this guy fucks
[1:28:53] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> He is the strom that approches
[1:28:53] <velgaduere> redemption arc, the character

[1:29:00] <@Moobot> @andre11dr WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 40 minutes
[1:29:00] <LuckyTerry> THE ONE
[1:29:02] <+Javaa01> The one for most of the game, yeah
[1:29:02] <+GilroyGoldBlood> There is one that is better
[1:29:03] <%Lion_kun> Nah there is a better summon
[1:29:04] <AnthroMetal> this is the BOI
[1:29:06] <%shakespearo> @Arqartur0 always viable and especially in this I think
[1:29:07] <zzNamttamzz> The one until the other one
[1:29:11] <+Byr0nX> 100
[1:29:14] <+Amaideus> @Arqartur0 The best tip I have for you is to dump points into HP once you find a weapon with a moveset you like and you have the stats to use it
[1:29:16] <velgaduere> big spend
[1:29:16] <ashenjuan25> woolieCHAN
[1:29:19] <@Irridium> he's good, but he's no [redacted]
[1:29:19] <+vaderxyz1970> He is #2
[1:29:19] <zenith0111> 100 ALL THAT FP BOI
[1:29:20] <+mundanelotus> yeah crazy spend
[1:29:21] <%holydeviant1> All of the legend/notorious ashes are really good and can carry boss battles.
[1:29:21] <Deko_> LUL
[1:29:22] <%Reveresao> need 4 levels in mind for OLEG
[1:29:25] <iacus_> late game bro
[1:29:26] <%pauperofthesouth> Jellyfish is still the best
[1:29:30] <Treasure_Vault> Getting 100 is your current goal. Nothing else matters.
[1:29:30] <@Irridium> though I'll be honest a lot of the summons are real good. Got 4 I really like
[1:29:31] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you're pulling in a boss
[1:29:31] <SoaringTrumpet> not gonna level up all my MInd for that
[1:29:31] <+devonoel> gotta go megamind
[1:29:32] <BlackermanZX> he is totally worth it
[1:29:32] <+charp35> Oleg is pretty cool
[1:29:32] <+Captain_sevatar> Oleg build
[1:29:33] <+Amaideus> Your weapons get more damage from upgrading than stat investment until you're high level
[1:29:35] <+thillygooth85> Time to hit the hyperbolic time chamber
[1:29:37] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> expand mind
[1:29:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> You'll get 100 at Mind level 20
[1:29:43] <iacus_> haha same as me, although I have a different renown ashes
[1:29:44] <badugidugi> LUL
[1:29:45] <%pauperofthesouth> LUL
[1:29:46] <+Amaideus> WE'VE GOTTA GET BIG BRAINNN
[1:29:46] <+FullMetalMonkey> The best summon is‚Ä¶. Beautiful
[1:29:51] <+Mrbaconator> @Irridium there's a defacto best one but a lot of them are cool
[1:29:52] <velgaduere> @Irridium [redacted] will absolutely be Woolie's go to if he wants to be Vergil
[1:29:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:29:53] <%holydeviant1> Besides, woolie is playing as a caster anyway
[1:29:54] <AnthroMetal> it's like a cerulean IV
[1:29:58] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Even if nobody got me, I know Oleg got me
[1:30:00] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 Oh I know, but I said before, the 1st bell bearing should have been in Limgrave, the MASSIVE starting area.
[1:30:01] <bamith23> By 20 Mind your FP starts going up by 6 instead of like 4 or something.
[1:30:01] <KyberNasse> Oleg uses a codpiece so that he can fit into the armor with the huge cock of his
[1:30:05] <rReizs> jellyfish aurelia supremacy
[1:30:07] <Aussie_Manny> doodBigBrain
[1:30:11] <KasiCrafter> You can use the Rune Arc to gain the levels to summon him, right?
[1:30:16] <iacus_> @Irridium well that's disappointing
[1:30:23] <+Nyanlathotep> @Freakin_Wolfy Even if nobody got me, I know that I got myself.
[1:30:26] <%AngryAsian5> When you summon Oleg, HE becomes the protagonist LUL
[1:30:36] <%pauperofthesouth> @AngryAsian5 LUL
[1:30:40] <%holydeviant1> @KasiCrafter With the first rune, yeah
[1:30:40] <Iniudan> @KasiCrafter Rune arc is just health without a greater rune.
[1:30:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> Sweet sweet turtle neck
[1:30:44] <@Solidus_113> twinkling path
[1:30:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> twink rocks
[1:30:49] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @Nyanlathotep nah, I suck at Elden Ring, Oleg is gonna be the Elden Lord in my game
[1:30:50] <velgaduere> YOU are OLEG'S summon
[1:30:52] <%ozzrabbit> Why am I picturing a Horned Viking helmet where the horns have been rotated and turned into mugs?
[1:31:04] <+volitzern> They are not rare at all Woolie, go for it lol
[1:31:06] <zenith0111> Crafting is so big in this
[1:31:07] <+patel347> its basically this games equivalent to twinkiling
[1:31:08] <+Amaideus> @WoolieVersus You get TONS of the twinkling equivalent and each weapon only needs 1 per level
[1:31:08] <yukichocomilk> those are going into moonveil
[1:31:09] <KasiCrafter> Ah I see
[1:31:10] <bamith23> @WoolieVersus By the way, hidden tip the game doesn't tell you. If you press L3 in your inventory you can sort your items differently, including by item acquisition if you want to read what you just picked up. Could save you a headache, I found it by accident.
[1:31:11] <+Nyanlathotep> @Freakin_Wolfy This was an allusion, you will understand someday

[1:31:38] <@Menitta> you can't stack holy damage with the incantations and ashes of war unfortunately
[1:31:39] <%youngking_kush> Its nuts
[1:31:43] <+twohitgood> bleed is great in this game.
[1:31:48] <+Freakin_Wolfy> @Nyanlathotep nah, I already beat the game. I know what you were referring to. Just in the beginning of the game Oleg carried me through the tough fights
[1:31:49] <FrostedZaibatsu> @bamith23 I mean if you read its there
[1:31:50] <velgaduere> @bamith23 oh he's definitely gonna want to see that
[1:31:56] <+Amaideus> @Menitta You can, but your buff has to come from the weapon art and not a spell or item
[1:31:59] <linSP> bleeding my own blood sword
[1:32:00] <%andre11dr> Bleeding is REALLY good
[1:32:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[1:32:02] <bamith23> I accidentally pressed L3 in the inventory and that came up. I looked at the bottom and L3 just isn't listed
[1:32:05] <%youngking_kush> @twohitgood Pretty much all status effects were massively buffed
[1:32:10] <+OniOniOniiii> this ones dece
[1:32:11] <AnthroMetal> gravitas is a good ash
[1:32:13] <%pauperofthesouth> cool
[1:32:14] <+Amaideus> Or find a weapon that can be enchanted baseline but also comes sith split damage
[1:32:25] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's great
[1:32:26] <Aussie_Manny> doodLUL GRAVITY SQUEEZDE
[1:32:31] <%Indigo_Automaton> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[1:32:34] <zenith0111> Gravity is Elden Rings big unique spell types that are kinda busted
[1:32:39] <FrostedZaibatsu> I swear L3 is on the menu
[1:32:48] <+Byr0nX> grabbity squezzz
[1:32:55] <@Menitta> @amaideus Yeah, I wanted to use both the weapon art and an incantations. If you have a weapon art that adds holy or magic damage equipped, you can't use a spell that does the same thing
[1:32:55] <7c_nickel> beetle
[1:32:56] <%andre11dr> There's multiple new types of spells
[1:32:56] <%ozzrabbit> SQUEEZE THAT BIATCH!
[1:32:57] <kadjah> death stranding vibe
[1:32:58] <%crybirb> There is a lot of them in the map woolie, don't worry youll see more
[1:33:00] <+devonoel> invisible beetle
[1:33:01] <Johannen> scarabs
[1:33:01] <Aussie_Manny> oh the invisible ghost things
[1:33:03] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You killed Jesus on the beach
[1:33:04] <+Byr0nX> da ball
[1:33:05] <velgaduere> the footsteps of the dung bettle
[1:33:05] <%youngking_kush> Rock Sling is still OP 110 hours in
[1:33:06] <bamith23> So I know holding down and up d-pad resets to your first slot, so that's also hidden, but Woolie does know that I think.
[1:33:06] <7c_nickel> its not a ball, its a dung beetle
[1:33:07] <velgaduere> *beetle
[1:33:07] <%Pillagius> Scarabs?
[1:33:11] <+Javaa01> Invisible ball
[1:33:18] <+Nyanlathotep> @Freakin_Wolfy That's fair. My main man really likes to jump bonk with his warhammer and it makes stagger locking some bosses trivially easy by alternating with him.
[1:33:19] <%pauperofthesouth> when there was only one pair of footsteps it was ball
[1:33:26] <+Amaideus> Not if you enchant the weapon with the elemental damage, yeah
[1:33:26] <FrostedZaibatsu> Is that what it is.... I missed hitting it all this time.. fuck
[1:33:27] <linSP> Yup not on the wiki
[1:33:33] <%andre11dr> There's gravity spells, blood spells, and the forbidden spells that give you madness
[1:33:34] <+Byr0nX> eh its just filler like dbz
[1:33:39] <+Moodbone> @pauperofthesouth LOL
[1:33:40] <+Amaideus> But some split weapons CAN be buffed
[1:33:44] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 Overall I just feel bad for the players who are getting absolutely decimated in the late game areas within their 1st hours into the game.
[1:33:45] <FrostedZaibatsu> This game sucks
[1:33:48] <bamith23> Everyone can just tell Woolie to press L3 in inventory lol
[1:33:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @FrostedZaibatsu yeah, gotta hit it at the front
[1:34:04] <+Byr0nX> a bat
[1:34:14] <FrostedZaibatsu> @FrostedZaibatsu I was swinging a good 5mins
[1:34:16] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Halberd gang rise up
[1:34:23] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus apparently L3 in inventory allows you to sort, which you can apparently do by "most recent"
[1:34:24] <+Byr0nX> ok ness
[1:34:27] <+JustToWatch> oh no, I can't believe Woolie killed Scrimblo and locked himself out of the "Lord of the Blimbo" ending

[1:36:02] <bamith23> How many times does mentioning the L3 in inventory allows sorting options turns into spam though? lol
[1:36:06] <%holydeviant1> For later
[1:36:07] <iacus_> oh another warmachine
[1:36:09] <luftraumm1> will make sense eventually]
[1:36:12] <iacus_> man those tips are useful
[1:36:15] <zenith0111> Wow thats like a mid-late game tip
[1:36:15] <velgaduere> @bamith23 it's not if multiple people do it
[1:36:21] <%andre11dr> That's for way later
[1:36:30] <linSP> I never tried the chimney
[1:36:30] <%okuriskyles> I have yet to take advantage of this hint for Fire Chariots 40 hours in, so they're right about the rare opportunity.
[1:36:40] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @ashenjuan25 Cos Ive heard that those difficuly spikes in the second half are ridiculous to the point of being blatantly unfair unless u have a ridiculous amount of health and damage.
[1:36:50] <%Gamefriendly> @okuriskyles are you still in limgrave?
[1:36:59] <AnthroMetal> @okuriskyles I'm at 115 hours in. Tried twice and said nvm I'll just backstab lol
[1:37:12] <DSD24> Bandit Mask is the good shit
[1:37:15] <%holydeviant1> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Last area is fuck-off leves of damage, but everything becomes manageable eventually
[1:37:17] <linSP> just so y‚Äôall know, vit 40 is the new vit 20
[1:37:20] <DSD24> Fits so well with so many armors
[1:37:27] <%youngking_kush> @linsp This
[1:37:28] <stuffamiriteyea> eat the trap
[1:37:32] <bamith23> I had a chance to jump attack a flame chariot, it heard me jump and turned around fucking it up.
[1:37:39] <+Amaideus> @linSP This, unironically
[1:37:39] <%pauperofthesouth> trap pls
[1:37:40] <+volitzern> Mmm, tasty trap~ lol
[1:37:48] <CatsDrunkonCopper> huff the chest gas

[1:37:58] <+Amaideus> WAIT
[1:38:08] <galko_chan1> I completed Caelid with 20 vit
[1:38:09] <%DapperCadavr> Caelid kiendiMonka
[1:38:09] <+Amaideus> I forgot we can mark ones
[1:38:12] <iacus_> if you eat that trap, spend your runes beforehand
[1:38:16] <@Irridium> ...you can mark sites of grace?!
[1:38:18] <+Amaideus> I need to do that to keep track of the ones I haven't done yet
[1:38:21] <+Captain_sevatar> DJ Caelid
[1:38:24] <+volitzern> Vit soft cap is up to 60, and the damage stats are up to 80 xD
[1:38:28] <berasite> Trap first, for the content Kappa
[1:38:28] <+Nyanlathotep> @Irridium You can mark whatever you want
[1:38:40] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus someone said that L3 in the inventory menu allows you to sort, which you can apparently do by "most recent"
[1:38:43] <AnthroMetal> @linSP I had no idea about the soft caps and was getting super made about dying in 1 hit to nearly everything after lurnia/caelid
[1:38:45] <Trace_Bovier> lake is cool
[1:38:47] <@Irridium> @Irridium I didn't think they'd be in a list like that
[1:38:50] <DSD24> Oh man that trap is the worst
[1:38:50] <bamith23> I did avoid the artist's shack for a bit cause a painting in a Fromsoft game gives off MAJOR ominous vibes.

[1:41:34] <@Irridium> I haven't found any of these locations
[1:41:34] <ShepherdShang> The painting is basically a treasure map

[1:41:55] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @holydeviant1 I've seen Caelids main boss and I think he's surprisingly manageable apart from his two already infamous meteorite-themed attacks. So I'm actually looking forward to fighting him. That skinny skin skin wearing duo however, Fuck that. That looks like the worst boss in the game this far.
[1:41:58] <%sewermonk> these paitings are hard as fuck to track
[1:41:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I liked those in breath of the wild
[1:42:00] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[1:42:02] <+Amaideus> It's the BoTW memory system
[1:42:18] <bamith23> @sewermonk Mostly cause the pictures are tiny
[1:42:19] <velgaduere> the BOTW memory mechanic was pretty cool, to be fair
[1:42:23] <+El_Rabbit> It's the map treasure hunt in black flag

[1:42:41] <AnthroMetal> @ShepherdShang oh my god
[1:42:52] <Johannen> I am still using the reward from this fort's boss, getting one shots in pvp
[1:42:54] <penitentpendant> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy They're the second most reviled fight in the game, to my knowledge
[1:43:02] <%pauperofthesouth> try stealth
[1:43:06] <Frazbeee> this one has cool reward
[1:43:14] <bamith23> Really? Wasn't that hard of a boss I remember

[1:48:57] <@Irridium> well at least this time the platinum game they're releasing near wasn't good. Last time it was Breath of the Wild and Nier Automata it was released near
[1:49:00] <%townzzzzz> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:49:02] <SmortyPuffin> whatever their motivations, they're not wrong about some of the UX stuff in this game
[1:49:04] <+MosesUnspoken> Horizon is fine but Elden Ring is special.
[1:49:05] <+Amaideus> Publishers are a dick sometimes
[1:49:08] <Frazbeee> Alloy looks like Nikocado
[1:49:08] <Johannen> Wasnt it the Quest design diss that came from Horizon?
[1:49:09] <%holydeviant1> The Battlefield guy going at it when he made one of the worst UIs ever is HILARIOUS
[1:49:13] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> ‚ÄúMaybe I should explore the fort‚Äù
[1:49:22] <Aussie_Manny> And yet the Horizon series still sees great success and accolades. So they should really chill.
[1:49:24] <+Jiggisnipe> welcome to Souls
[1:49:25] <iacus_> this UI isn't the pretties but it's perfectly functional? and suited to a non-handholdy game like this one
[1:49:26] <oda_flobunaga> There are people Review Bombing ER on Metacritic because of it
[1:49:26] <%Prevot> talking shit about elden ring UX is code for thr usual gamedev racism against japan
[1:49:29] <bamith23> Boy, Woolie is gonna love that Magic Greatbow that actually has the range he wants.
[1:49:31] <+0neReeler> Horizon is just a fancy AC
[1:49:33] <zenith0111> @irridium Omg and theyre all about exploring lost advanced civilizations LUL
[1:49:35] <%pauperofthesouth> LUL woolie went in guns blazing
[1:49:36] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Did Woolie talk to the owner of this fort yet?
[1:49:36] <+Jiggisnipe> obfuscation is the name of the game
[1:49:40] <AnthroMetal> @holydeviant1 It's almost unbelievable
[1:49:42] <%FugitiveJay> if the barrels are red, they explode
[1:49:46] <+Exicuren> Sony really underestimated Elden Ring
[1:49:48] <+orochiblood> The Battlefield 2042 guy doesnt get to talk about UI, thats the comical part.
[1:50:01] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Valid criticisms are fine but why were being saltier than movie popcorn
[1:50:04] <+Captain_sevatar> blood rat
[1:50:05] <penitentpendant> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy That fight has some mechanics that breaks 'boss design 101'
[1:50:07] <+orochiblood> BF 2042's UI is atrocious and it just got a scoreboard  lmaoo
[1:50:08] <+Vigonept> oh i never finished this place cause fuck this
[1:50:11] <AnthroMetal> @orochiblood what do you mean you want a scoreboard? this is clearly halo's fault
[1:50:12] <TigerClaws12> the only 100% valid criticism in that thread was the PC issues
[1:50:14] <nintega010> @0nereeler a better ac
[1:50:14] <%Reveresao> Oh the ashes here woolie gonna like

[1:50:54] <emptyantics> He‚Äôs fucking REAL
[1:50:58] <penitentpendant> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Very much so, however so is 85% of boss fights in the game.
[1:51:12] <%shakespearo> it's bullshit I can't put that on my naginata, even though that's just a sword on a stick
[1:51:12] <iacus_> he's just in between mid-boss and regular enemy

[1:51:48] <Gin_SXL> goated ash of war
[1:51:56] <%holydeviant1> @shakespearo I wish I could ash of war my Coded Sword, but hey
[1:52:08] <gryffinp> Mount and Blade style
[1:52:12] <Jerp> I want more than one ash that I can put on a staff
[1:52:15] <luftraumm1> luftraumm1 gifted a Tier 1 sub to oda_flobunaga! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[1:52:16] <%livlinn> woolieYE summons
[1:52:18] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[1:52:20] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @penitentpendant Thank fucking God
[1:52:23] <+Akizea> @holydeviant1 atleast the ash of war on that one is super good
[1:52:31] <bamith23> Kinda wish I could ash of war my meteor katana, I like the look with my other katana, but prefer other stats on it.
[1:52:36] <Jerp> I'm expecting there to be others, but damn finding random spells and spellcaster-friendly ashes seems few and far between
[1:52:37] <%holydeviant1> @Akizea Oh yeah, it's fantastic
[1:52:42] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:52:47] <gryffinp> !UNHORSED!

[1:52:54] <+Jiggisnipe> does Woolie not know war history? Kappa
[1:52:54] <%holydeviant1> horse is probably almost ded
[1:52:55] <bamith23> @Jerp A lot of them are up north around the academy I found.
[1:52:57] <Aussie_Manny> Never mind that shit. HERE COMES MONGO! D:
[1:53:01] <emptyantics> Auuuu
[1:53:02] <bamith23> Which makes sense
[1:53:18] <%pauperofthesouth> with shield guys a late swing works for me
[1:53:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:53:22] <kinkade_77> That scream sounds like it‚Äôs from Lego Star Wars
[1:53:24] <%shakespearo> @Jerp I think everyone just finds tons of stuff they don't need for their build. I have a bazillion spells,but only like one armor set that is better than the one I started in
[1:53:32] <Jerp> bamith23 ashes of war you can put on staffs? or just spells? It least found a bunch of spells over there
[1:53:52] <FourLeafLover> does the dragging hitbox of the strong attack bounce off shields?
[1:53:54] <+MosesUnspoken> Watching someone else's approach is always interesting because I took these guys out one by one with stealth.
[1:53:55] <+Amaideus> I haven't found any WA's for staffs other than the one you can buy off Rog
[1:54:00] <bamith23> @Jerp I think staves have like generally 1, maybe 2 ash of wars in total, but there are a number of ones for other weapons.
[1:54:03] <Jerp> @Jerp so far it really looks like the way items drop is like, if your build is good in that area, you'll find stuff that isn't for your build
[1:54:18] <Aussie_Manny> i'm spinning around
[1:54:19] <%TheHateFish> YO
[1:54:19] <+Amaideus> Man
[1:54:20] <%MajorCrasher> where are all these spells I keep hearing about? I've found almost none as an astrologer lol
[1:54:20] <%Xelhesia> YOOOO RARE DROP
[1:54:21] <+MosesUnspoken> BEST SHIELD
[1:54:21] <%holydeviant1> Brass shield is pretty good!
[1:54:21] <Lieutori> The GOAT shield
[1:54:21] <%shakespearo> GOATED shield right there
[1:54:21] <zenith0111> Good Shield
[1:54:22] <Aussie_Manny> move out of my waaay
[1:54:22] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Good shit
[1:54:22] <luftraumm1> brass shield POG
[1:54:24] <SoaringTrumpet> oh nice
[1:54:25] <BlackermanZX> NICE
[1:54:25] <%TheHateFish> That one's GOAT
[1:54:25] <+Amaideus> I've been trying to get that for ages
[1:54:27] <AnthroMetal> @FourLeafLover it doesn't deflect but it gets blocked. I wonder if the status build up gets through though
[1:54:29] <BlackermanZX> thats a good one
[1:54:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now that shield, it's pretty nice
[1:54:31] <Aussie_Manny> Good shield, chat says. wifiThink
[1:54:36] <gryffinp> I rocked the brass shield for a while, good early metal shield but it's heavy
[1:54:37] <perfectSoma> yeah you can
[1:54:40] <+sambws> You can two hand your staff in your left hand to use it
[1:54:40] <bamith23> You can swap weapons on horseback
[1:54:41] <BlackermanZX> PRAISE THE DORITO
[1:54:42] <@Solidus_113> switch hands
[1:54:42] <wandelmilch> yeah you can
[1:54:42] <+Akizea> you can cast from horseback
[1:54:42] <+Jiggisnipe> OH shir
[1:54:43] <%BestTeaMaker> you can switch hands
[1:54:43] <dralakbadusk> yes you can
[1:54:44] <+Amaideus> You can, you have to swap to it like 2 handing
[1:54:44] <%funya_rinpa> I've been using that shield for the whole game
[1:54:45] <TigerClaws12> you can switch on horse back
[1:54:45] <%Prevot> you gotta 2 hand it
[1:54:47] <%Deasmeister> You can if you two hand it
[1:54:47] <+CrystalTree07> but it is heavy
[1:54:47] <rReizs> you gotta 2 hand on horseback
[1:54:47] <%sewermonk> press Y + Left Bumper on horse
[1:54:47] <zenith0111> POG
[1:54:48] <velgaduere> we've done it
[1:54:48] <%Lightwolfe> you can if you input two hand on horseback
[1:54:48] <+Dragon4234> You can swap hands lol
[1:54:49] <%holydeviant1> NO SKILL
[1:54:51] <Aussie_Manny> It's a golden dorito! LUL DoritosChip
[1:54:53] <+Captain_sevatar> is a gud shield
[1:54:53] <+Amaideus> And its stability is awesome
[1:54:54] <luftraumm1> iirc you can double hand the staff on horseback
[1:54:56] <emptyantics> NOICE
[1:54:56] <yukichocomilk> YOU... DID IT
[1:54:56] <Lieutori> 2 hand input switches weapon side
[1:54:57] <SoaringTrumpet> very good stability on that too
[1:54:57] <agustorm123> Well have it
[1:54:58] <%Reveresao> take off gloves
[1:54:59] <+tnomads> used that my whole playthru
[1:55:01] <%itstreylar> you can use two handing input to switch weapon hands on horseback
[1:55:01] <+sceptic62> Its as good as black knight shield
[1:55:02] <AllenDeadman> 100 phys no skill
[1:55:03] <DTGL_Bhagavan> You can dual wield your staff to shoot from horseback
[1:55:05] <Sparda_blizzard> This is the one im using currently
[1:55:05] <QueequegTheater> Where we at boys
[1:55:06] <+Amaideus> It's better than everything I've found
[1:55:07] <BlackermanZX> the dorito is pretty good
[1:55:08] <Aussie_Manny> SirMad DoritosChip
[1:55:13] <+Dakuu75> if you do the "2 hand" button on horse, it switchs between the left and right weapon
[1:55:14] <bamith23> Best shield that doesn't look like a dumb turtle.
[1:55:15] <dralakbadusk> Press r1 plus triangle to wield the left hand on horse back
[1:55:17] <emptyantics> DoritosChip
[1:55:17] <+sceptic62> It‚Äôs BK SHIELD 2.0 lol
[1:55:17] <%shakespearo> I've been using this for 60 hours since it dropped, it's good as fuck
[1:55:17] <AnthroMetal> dorito tiiiiiiiiime
[1:55:21] <MyNameIsRasus> The war from which no lord arose
[1:55:22] <QueequegTheater> It's good but it's super heavy
[1:55:27] <SoaringTrumpet> it's got as strong a block as some great shields
[1:55:37] <zenith0111> Omg it is a Dorito you ruined it for me LUL
[1:55:39] <Jerp> interesting thing about horseback: since you're not really two-handing anything per-se, you can use either two-hand input (Y+LB, Y+RB) to just use your left-hand weapon
[1:55:42] <%holydeviant1> It's a real nice one
[1:55:43] <luftraumm1> reconsider narmour?
[1:55:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> get the scale
[1:55:47] <QueequegTheater> It's basically the Black Knight shield from DS1
[1:55:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> or I guess taking the bow off
[1:55:50] <+Amaideus> Does anyone know if there's a damage penalty for not having an armor slot filled?
[1:55:51] <+tempestzephyr> take yer pants off!
[1:55:56] <SarcFa> much better guard stat tho so less stamina loss on block
[1:56:04] <+Captain_sevatar> protection doesnt matter in this game
[1:56:04] <agustorm123> Armor is important now
[1:56:06] <funnyfunnykid> When your scrub quoting friends tell you you got no skill, they meant your shield's skill requirements
[1:56:13] <+Amaideus> Protection absolutely matters
[1:56:18] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @penitentpendant Cos aside from Margits bullshit second phase, I've been enjoying these boss fights so far. Though I've noticed a pattern of bosses (as well as enemies) often having these 1 or 2 moves that as Plague has described them: are "free hits". I hate that as a trend in these modern Fromsoft games.
[1:56:19] <+tnomads> If you buff that shield with magic shield spell it's OP
[1:56:25] <Lazywabbit> It does an anime dash n slice on the second l2 right?
[1:56:27] <+Amaideus> I've been playing with low HP and it's made the difference between being 1 shot or being 2 shot
[1:56:29] <%pi_in_the_sci> isn't there a second part to that flippy move?
[1:56:30] <%Cozy90> Hi everyone! :)
[1:56:31] <bamith23> This might actually be the first game since Dark Souls 1 where using a huge ass shield is completely viable too, i'll have to try that one playthrough.
[1:56:31] <+Captain_sevatar> really? it hasnt seemed to make a difference to me @Amaideus
[1:56:33] <jacknerik> Does grace reswpawn harvest spots too?
[1:56:35] <%holydeviant1> @Captain_sevatar Shield seems to be accurate percentages, poise seems to work right, but yeah, otherwise it's iffy
[1:56:36] <+CrystalTree07> triangle + R!
[1:56:37] <+devonoel> two hnad left hand
[1:56:41] <+Jiggisnipe> someone 2 hand
[1:56:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Y + L
[1:56:45] <@Solidus_113> no
[1:56:45] <+Jiggisnipe> said*
[1:56:46] <%Lightwolfe> input two hand
[1:56:47] <rReizs> you have to 2 hand input
[1:56:47] <%itstreylar> 2 hand woolie
[1:56:48] <RedBlossomail> two hand it LUL
[1:56:48] <+Dragon4234> no
[1:56:48] <%Deasmeister> 2 hand
[1:56:49] <bamith23> Goodness Woolie, you scrub
[1:56:51] <+daemonazaezal> 2-hand left woolie
[1:56:53] <TigerClaws12> triangle + R1
[1:56:53] <perfectSoma> triangle and r1
[1:56:54] <+pectusumbra> seems to be 2handing
[1:56:54] <dralakbadusk> two hand it
[1:56:56] <+Amaideus> I cast all the time
[1:56:57] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:56:58] <%pi_in_the_sci> Two-hand the left hand with triangle
[1:56:58] <%MajorCrasher> right hand or 2 hand it
[1:56:58] <bobxmaker> hold triangle then L!
[1:56:58] <zenith0111> Its weeeeird
[1:56:59] <agustorm123> You can‚Äôt cast with left hand
[1:57:01] <%holydeviant1> no worries wools
[1:57:01] <+Vigonept> it aint though
[1:57:02] <+0neReeler> not 2hand it's switching hands
[1:57:03] <+Captain_sevatar> @holydeviant1 for shields I agree I meant for armor specifically
[1:57:05] <+Amaideus> You can only cast on the right side
[1:57:06] <bamith23> Silly Woolie lol
[1:57:07] <gryffinp> Yeah I don't like it either
[1:57:08] <zenith0111> Its not very intuitive
[1:57:10] <AnthroMetal> yeah it 's a little clunky
[1:57:11] <+Dakuu75> Don't sweat it. it's really weird.
[1:57:14] <+devonoel> you get used to it
[1:57:15] <+Jiggisnipe> idk it's weird
[1:57:20] <agustorm123> Is not great
[1:57:20] <+0neReeler> switch hand
[1:57:21] <perfectSoma> it's not great but you CAN do it
[1:57:22] <gryffinp> but I just don't cast on the horse, it slows you to a walk anyway
[1:57:27] <%sewermonk> its nt technically 2 handing, its more like just a swap
[1:57:27] <+Jiggisnipe> but maybe you hold the horse with the left
[1:57:28] <+CrystalTree07> its a weird input top switch but you swing in on both sides
[1:57:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> loophole
[1:57:30] <%holydeviant1> @Captain_sevatar There's like one set that's made a difference to me and it's basically Havels'
[1:57:31] <+0neReeler> since you can swing left or right side
[1:57:32] <luftraumm1> the whole y modifier is weird
[1:57:33] <rReizs> its basically so you can attack from both directions unfortunately
[1:57:35] <+MightyDuckShoes> Been playing this game for over thirty hours and still haven't even seen Margit. The world is so dense and explorable from the jump. It's nuts. Reminds me of my first time playing Morrowind
[1:57:39] <+robertoszek> it is what it is
[1:57:39] <+tnomads> it's for balance
[1:57:41] <+Vigonept> hold the horee
[1:57:42] <bamith23> So I have my staff in the right hand because I have spell sword stuff on it, so I might as well have a block with it
[1:57:45] <+volitzern> Your L1 becomes an attack on the left side with it weapon.
[1:57:52] <Jerp> @WoolieVersus you can use either two-hand input (Y+LB, Y+RB) to switch to your left-hand weapon while on horse
[1:57:55] <%hax_metatron> Casting on horse rules, you're basically God and untouchable, I used meteors and summon swords while riding and it rocsk
[1:57:57] <+volitzern> your weapon*
[1:58:08] <%sewermonk> Fort, Night
[1:58:15] <gryffinp> maybe you should wait until night to assault that fort
[1:58:16] <crackedhappiness> wolf pack vs rat pack
[1:58:17] <$narthwatt> @woolieversus PRESS TRIANGLE AND L1 ON HORSEBACK AND IT SWAPS TO YOUR STAFF ON YOUR LEFT HAND
[1:58:22] <+Amaideus> Bruh
[1:58:24] <@Solidus_113> he knows dude
[1:58:25] <+Amaideus> We just saw him do it
[1:58:26] <gryffinp> little slow bud
[1:58:28] <%oda_flobunaga> BTW, I think I figured out why all the Status AOEs do real damage as well as Status buildup.
[1:58:29] <+Captain_sevatar> @holydeviant1 I think I know the one youre talking about and yeah it does have some beefy stats so it might help you out but against the end game bosses they shred most armor like paper

[1:58:31] <@Solidus_113> refresh your stream
[1:58:34] <%funya_rinpa> Y'all are so delayed, lol
[1:58:40] <+aspirationdeath> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy you can roll out of any hit. sometimes distance and positioning need to be considered, but at over 100 hours i havent found that even the most bullshit aoes with lingering hitboxes cant be out rolled if timed and positioned properly
[1:58:41] <velgaduere> how did moobot not catch that message lmao
[1:58:43] <+Jiggisnipe> mobile users Kappa
[1:58:43] <bamith23> Kinda sad I have like 40 spells and only like 5 of them I would consider actually kinda good to use. A lot of them I see potential for PvP though.

[2:00:15] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Don't feel bad. Millions have died because of rats.
[2:00:18] <%sherlockkat> I found that fighting on foot is easier in general. Better footsie control.

[2:00:19] <yukichocomilk> cue the jerma rat song
[2:00:21] <%livlinn> Mau5 woolieGLORY
[2:00:22] <bamith23> @Jerp I would say Glintstone pebble, Glintstone Arc, Ice shot thing , Cannon of Haima is fantastic for groups when you get it, magic Greatbow is legit for long range... And Carian Slicer is pretty great for DPS. Most others I see for PvP crowd control.
[2:00:23] <%sherlockkat> Horse combat is very wonky.
[2:00:24] <+Emperor_Machinus> Elden That King
[2:00:24] <%Pillagius> magic pixel FTW
[2:00:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> they want the fort
[2:00:36] <+volitzern> On horseback your attacks become L1 to swing left, R1 to swing right and same for heavy attacks. So you can't use your left hand armaments.
[2:00:39] <perfect_disaster> woolie pls change her voice
[2:00:39] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie's character cries out like a baby LUL
[2:00:45] <+Amaideus> There's a mist spell I found that absolutely cheeses tough enemies
[2:00:47] <+sambws> Has he used the golden seed he got
[2:00:49] <+Byr0nX> lol woolie's toon sounds like Aloy or that one Dragon's Dogma voice
[2:00:52] <zzNamttamzz> I use the beast repeling torch now, no dieing to rats for me
[2:00:55] <masterofskillz1> 2 hand your left handed armament to use it on horseback folks
[2:00:57] <+Jiggisnipe> ikr his damage wail is so weird LUL
[2:01:02] <%holydeviant1> @sherlockkat It really depends. Some larger enemies and some bosses are piss on horseback (looking at you, Asshole In The Rot Swamp)
[2:01:06] <bamith23> I tried frozen mist and the hitbox seemed broken, wouldn't do anything lol
[2:01:17] <Frazbeee> sounds like charlie day
[2:01:19] <+Amaideus> The enemy would have to sit in the mist I think
[2:01:23] <iacus_> you can just bypass the outside fight tho?
[2:01:24] <+Amaideus> Because it'd be a build up over time
[2:01:26] <agustorm123> That‚Äôs why sorcery is better you one shot this soldiers
[2:01:37] <bamith23> Might as well use Hoarfrost Stomp instead though
[2:01:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> one zone I guess
[2:01:44] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @penitentpendant It sucks that u have no choice whatsoever but to take damage in this game because of how lighting fast those "free hits" are. It doesn't ruin the game for me, but it's a huge issue that Fromsoftware just LOVES to keep amplifying.
[2:01:46] <Aussie_Manny> woolieEVIL khadKEK khadKEK khadKEK
[2:01:46] <Dotados> Its an old fashioned dungeon
[2:01:49] <perfect_disaster> I like that shield. very shinny
[2:01:51] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Dungeons and Forts dont count as overworld
[2:02:00] <%livlinn> kyoryuPet kyoryuPet kyoryuPet
[2:02:09] <tolloponik> I broke down the front door, Where are my sips
[2:02:09] <+Vigonept> dungeon crawl mode
[2:02:10] <+tempestzephyr> apparently 2-handing your sword before riding you horse makes it do more damage even though you swing with 1 hand on horse
[2:02:14] <%pauperofthesouth> try luring out
[2:02:19] <bamith23> fleeeee
[2:02:21] <niffinbox> pan piper their ass
[2:02:25] <badugidugi> behold, dog!
[2:02:30] <bamith23> Flee like a hero Woolie!
[2:02:33] <slix3431> So, we've committed to the style blade?
[2:02:39] <MrMoonGoose> Thankfully there aren't that many mobs here. This is a small dungeon.
[2:02:47] <dralakbadusk> Rats are fucking scary
[2:02:54] <+Amaideus> Have you upgraded your weapon?
[2:02:56] <+Das_Prints> This rat neutral is wild
[2:02:56] <+volitzern> I use shield on left hand and staff on the right. Barely use my sword until I got my Moonlight GS lol
[2:02:58] <dralakbadusk> they never not become a real treat
[2:03:01] <MrMoonGoose> Rats never stop being scary.
[2:03:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> rats hit the gym
[2:03:03] <bamith23> Rat beats wolves
[2:03:03] <%pauperofthesouth> wolf no
[2:03:04] <+0neReeler> rat power
[2:03:06] <+MosesUnspoken> Rat > Dog
[2:03:07] <emptyantics> Rats lvl99
[2:03:09] <@Irridium> sometimes the greatsword just whiffs over rats and dogs and man is it annoying
[2:03:09] <penitentpendant> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Dogs and rats in particular have 'active startup' which punishes any melee build that doesn't use shields. It's what makes them dangerous in groups because they can overlap attacks and stunlock you to death.
[2:03:09] <%holydeviant1> To be fair, the goblins are explitly made of rock
[2:03:10] <zenith0111> If you hold off on upgrading early game its going to get real rough
[2:03:10] <agustorm123> Rats are known to take 3 or 4 hits in real life LUL
[2:03:16] <niffinbox> king of the rats!
[2:03:17] <+ShadowRFox> rats do a lot of damage in this game, especially for early levels.
[2:03:17] <AnthroMetal> those imps in dungeys are made of stone tho
[2:03:18] <+saintd263> remember the biggest one makes all of the rules
[2:03:21] <%crybirb> wait till woolie go to the city sewers hahahah rats in there, the medievalk new york are crazy
[2:03:22] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:03:24] <perfect_disaster> I hate those globins or wherever they are
[2:03:25] <Happy_D_> You ever see a rat that big? Yeah, I thought not
[2:03:26] <%hax_metatron> Wait till Woolie meets the madness rat LUL
[2:03:30] <+Fetrigon> woolie is playing so safe LUL
[2:03:39] <+Byr0nX> you know you dont have to kill everything? you can zoom past
[2:03:39] <dralakbadusk> Rats are only weak to hoarfrost stomp and THATS IT
[2:03:39] <+theoldone001> Rats have always been weirdly strong in these games, they specially don't give a fuck about your poise too
[2:03:40] <+Fetrigon> against a rat LUL LUL LUL
[2:03:41] <bamith23> Surprised Fromsoft hasn't done an actual Ratking abomination enemy.
[2:04:02] <bamith23> I guess the snakes from Bloodborne are closest thing.
[2:04:06] <%funya_rinpa> I don't think the charge on that affect damage
[2:04:06] <reasonance> getting in a fight with a badass-looking knight and 2 shitdogs, and the DOGS being the more scary part is so stupid LUL
[2:04:13] <+Amaideus> The charge does affect damage
[2:04:17] <%crybirb> @funya_rinpa It does affect damage
[2:04:19] <%funya_rinpa> Ah, okay
[2:04:25] <NeonBleu> RAT
[2:04:26] <perfect_disaster> RAT!
[2:04:30] <penitentpendant> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy In most boss fights though, there are ways to safely roll and i-frame through attacks. Takes practice for them though.
[2:04:31] <emptyantics> RAT!
[2:04:32] <@DashXero> Rats are tough!
[2:04:34] <%pauperofthesouth> lets gooo
[2:04:36] <+ShadowRFox> did wollie see the room on the first floor?
[2:04:37] <zenith0111> "Okay you have to kill a mob of Rats" "Ah easy" "Theyre Miyazaki Rats" "Fuck that"
[2:04:42] <+theoldone001> @reasonance They know too, because they've barely changed the dog movesets over the years lol
[2:04:51] <bamith23> I am actually disappointed you can't use ballistas and stuff
[2:04:56] <+Amaideus> At least the dogs don't teleport any more
[2:04:57] <+oAznoUta> the hidden rat is the most dangerous rat
[2:04:59] <+Fetrigon> destroy it
[2:05:01] <+MosesUnspoken> lol
[2:05:02] <+Dakuu75> you can break those ballista mounts but, I don't think there's much point
[2:05:04] <+aspirationdeath> salty scrubs in chat need to git gud. dont run shieldless if you dont have to resolve to learn patterns and safe distances/positions. enemies dont have "free" hits, you just havent got the sauce
[2:05:04] <niffinbox> crouching tiger hidden rat
[2:05:05] <penitentpendant> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy It's why I like faith builds, health regen covers a plenitude of sins
[2:05:05] <%MajorCrasher> this whole area plays so much different as a full magic build. I kinda steamrolled it
[2:05:07] <%crybirb> dogs were changed to bloodborne I think, and then it stuck
[2:05:09] <Aussie_Manny> stfu, message
[2:05:18] <agustorm123> Dogs are faster
[2:05:24] <+theoldone001> I found one rat in a box like the Depths. It was hilarious watching him break out lol
[2:05:25] <iacus_> LUL
[2:05:38] <perfect_disaster> welp...
[2:05:44] <%Reveresao> ...
[2:05:47] <%crybirb> wait till woolie sees that this quest nobody knows how to finish it hahahaha
[2:05:51] <Dopamien> @reasonance I still more afraid of the flailing torch hollow over a knight LUL

[2:05:58] <perfect_disaster> he is not that bad
[2:05:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that guy is kind of a dumbass
[2:06:02] <%andre11dr> Don't worry, I'm sure he will
[2:06:05] <@Irridium> tfw no pickle :(
[2:06:06] <%holydeviant1> I actually really like the guy associated with this quest, even if he is a bit dumb
[2:06:10] <+Fetrigon> he won't. it's a souls game LUL
[2:06:16] <%crybirb> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ the datamined dialogue makes him good
[2:06:18] <+HeadAsianInCharge> HeadAsianInCharge subscribed with Prime. 
[2:06:25] <+Amaideus> @Dopamien Big winged knight? NBD. Hollow with a torch? REAL SHIT
[2:06:31] <ImSincerelySorry> he said the knight was bedeviled by blood
[2:06:31] <+Das_Prints> I remember killing that blood knight once and a rat rolled in from behind his corpse a tagged me for the kill. They are crafty.
[2:06:33] <kadjah> what's the frequency Kenneth
[2:06:38] <TigerClaws12> GRAND ME SUCCOR
[2:06:40] <agustorm123> Is the guy a lannister tho?

[2:08:44] <crackedhappiness> you can also get a new drink to make it more i think
[2:08:45] <iacus_> that's not even a spoiler

[2:10:16] <+aspirationdeath> @iacus_ the joy of this game is in large part discovery. gotta preserve those dopamine hits in a souls game no matter how meagre. you want us to go hollow?
[2:10:21] <+TopTieramisu> pls tell me that was pasta
[2:10:25] <Aussie_Manny> The dorito shield is plenty. DoritosChip
[2:10:31] <QueequegTheater> @holydeviant1 "HEY DID YOU FIND OUT THAT AERITH DIES YET? WHAT DO YOU MEAN i'M SPOILING?"
[2:10:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @crybirb What was said yesterday? I missed the podcast
[2:10:50] <Aussie_Manny> Is the dorito shield dropping from Mongo there guaranteed? Or luck based?
[2:11:01] <zenith0111> Luck
[2:11:02] <agustorm123> Toxic applied  to chat
[2:11:06] <Iza_kku> guy says obvious spoiler "WHY ARE YOU BOOING ME, I'M RIGHT"
[2:11:08] <QueequegTheater> @Aussie_Manny I've gotten multiple so I'm pretty sure it's random
[2:11:11] <%crybirb> @crybirb its about the skills but i'll refer from going on because people insist this is a spoiler
[2:11:12] <+Das_Prints> @aussie_manny Brass shield is random from foot soldiers.
[2:11:21] <iacus_> gotta invest in a glintstone pebble
[2:11:22] <Pubstar_LTD> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy read your paragraph, you can still do that in ds2, ds3 and this one too
[2:11:23] <%crybirb> @Aussie_Manny I god 3 all random
[2:11:23] <Aussie_Manny> Ah gahd, not luck! NotLikeThis
[2:11:24] <penitentpendant> @Aussie_Manny Dorito shield is mainly luck based. Which gives some people some trouble.
[2:11:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @andre11dr Woolie's sword might do bleed, but chat does scarlet rot
[2:11:28] <zenith0111> Theres a slightly better lighter shield later
[2:11:34] <+0neReeler> try rear
[2:11:34] <justcallmebobplease> Yeah, because where to pick up a move is the same sort of spoiler as major plot beats.
[2:11:36] <Aussie_Manny> Fucking gacha.
[2:11:59] <BreakfastSampler> @justcallmebobplease lead poisoning doesn't care about details like that
[2:12:09] <bamith23> Gear is nerfed in this game by looking silly lol
[2:12:10] <+Jiggisnipe> @justcallmebobplease discovering things on your own is part of joy of this game, don't ruin it for people
[2:12:16] <QueequegTheater> @justcallmebobplease yes, unironically
[2:12:21] <agustorm123> Finger butt
[2:12:24] <bamith23> Like sure a helmet gives me +6 int, but it also looks dumb
[2:12:27] <T_Sasquatch> L + Ratio + Maidenless + Touch Grace
[2:12:30] <+TopTieramisu> there's always someone that has their arbitrary cutoff of difficulty with these games
[2:12:30] <+0neReeler> ! danger !
[2:12:33] <dralakbadusk> just don't talk about items locations and that it
[2:12:34] <%crybirb> @Jiggisnipe nobody spoiled where, just said things can be got.
[2:12:44] <%Juriasu> Reggie gotta compliment the guy with the fire mombs
[2:12:45] <%holydeviant1> @justcallmebobplease Perhaps it is time to simply close the chat.
[2:12:46] <+TopTieramisu> even though this game gives you so many options
[2:12:46] <zenith0111> @breakfastsampler Some of the Moves are huge spoilers on their own
[2:12:47] <%Juriasu> bombs*
[2:12:51] <+Jiggisnipe> @crybirb don't give clues, it's not hard lol
[2:12:55] <justcallmebobplease> @QueeguegTheater Equally unironically I appreciate the consistency of hill-to-die-on, there.
[2:12:56] <Aussie_Manny> Man, those Gate of Babylon swords hit hard.
[2:13:02] <%crybirb> @Jiggisnipe nobody gave clues, people said "you getskills"
[2:13:04] <%oda_flobunaga> Man, I sure hope Snape doesn't kill trinity with Rosebud
[2:13:06] <bamith23> Where did he go...
[2:13:09] <zenith0111> @breakfastsampler Oops wrong reply lol
[2:13:14] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @pubstar_ltd How far are u into the game? And what build are u using?
[2:13:19] <Aussie_Manny> Out of a hole in the wall. Duh.
[2:13:31] <%holydeviant1> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy No, don't, item names are spoilers
[2:13:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that headband can be pretty style
[2:13:35] <bamith23> Woolie is never gonna find rat-boi, I know I wouldn't have if I didn't watch Pat lol
[2:13:44] <+TopTieramisu> it's like wearing nothing
[2:13:52] <dralakbadusk> oh yeah i still haven't foud Rat boi
[2:13:56] <yukichocomilk> fashion souls if you look pretty
[2:13:58] <agustorm123> Elden ring fractured but whole
[2:14:00] <%Indigo_Automaton> I love that headband
[2:14:02] <%MajorCrasher> discovery is cool and all, but it's not the end all be all for me personally in games. I get how you guys feel because I'm the same, I wanna just know everything that'll help from the jump lol. But please be respectful to those who do love discovery and hold back a bit.
[2:14:16] <QueequegTheater> @MajorCrasher But it is for the person who is streaming
[2:14:18] <%crybirb> I dunno who asked if fromsoft ever made a rat monstrosity, but the thing in the ground at the entrance of this fort is a rat monstrosity
[2:14:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:14:30] <Aussie_Manny> Trap, my ass. it's probably Milhouse.
[2:14:39] <+Reverend_Roscoe> theres a ratboi here?
[2:14:42] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @holydeviant1 Alright fine. Just the build then.
[2:14:44] <+Jiggisnipe> @MajorCrasher yea it's that simple lol, I don
[2:14:46] <bamith23> I should use the glowing stones more.
[2:14:49] <%MajorCrasher> @queequegtheater I know, that's why I asked them to hold back lol
[2:14:50] <+ShadowRFox> the rats come from that room, I'm surprise they triggered on wollie so quickly
[2:14:51] <Aussie_Manny> It wasn't a trap? Goddamn you, Miyazaki.
[2:14:51] <zenith0111> What new recipes have we found?
[2:14:54] <%crybirb> @Reverend_Roscoe he is dead in the floor at the entrance
[2:14:56] <%okuriskyles> @crybirb royal ray authority
[2:14:57] <Pubstar_LTD> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy final area, strength build with some int in there

[2:15:18] <Dopamien> what a shitty cookbook DansGame who eats this
[2:15:18] <dralakbadusk> B L O O D
[2:15:18] <QueequegTheater> @MajorCrasher I actually didn't finish reading your comment until after I typed my response
[2:15:20] <QueequegTheater> Whoops
[2:15:25] <BreakfastSampler> @MajorCrasher woolie has been streaming for a long time and knows what to expect of chat - he wouldn't be streaming at all if it meant that much
[2:15:27] <%Juriasu> bloodbone is only one letter off from bloodborne PogChamp
[2:15:28] <%MajorCrasher> it's cool man lol
[2:15:30] <%crybirb> I finished 100% on sunday, game's good
[2:15:31] <agustorm123> Double blood
[2:15:34] <Aussie_Manny> Fuck yo' shit
[2:15:34] <bamith23> Yay, I helped. Maybe. He may end up hating the need to do that later lol
[2:15:34] <velgaduere> @Dopamien what, never had blood pudding before? doodSmug
[2:15:35] <%okuriskyles> is there anything more gross than blood grease
[2:15:37] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:15:50] <Aussie_Manny> Dead eotan.
[2:15:57] <QueequegTheater> He's the big rat that makes all of the rules
[2:16:01] <agustorm123> Are we getting bloodbourne 2 tomorrow tho?
[2:16:03] <+Amaideus> @okuriskyles I'm shocked you can't use shit to make poison weapons
[2:16:11] <+Thatghostpepper> @Theycallmenerf why yes, he's beaten manu enemies
[2:16:12] <bamith23> kek kek kek
[2:16:14] <iacus_> root resin is valuable
[2:16:17] <QueequegTheater> Kappa
[2:16:18] <iacus_> found in forests
[2:16:19] <+Jiggisnipe> and then it bugged Kappa
[2:16:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at least the resin is easily found
[2:16:25] <%holydeviant1> That shit can be found in forests, and in certain catacombs.
[2:16:27] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus I think that might be a beastmen mother the questgiver was talking about
[2:16:28] <TheMadDemoknight> @okuriskyles what even is blood grease?
[2:16:30] <zenith0111> Root Resin is found... near trees... Helpful Kappa
[2:16:34] <%sewermonk> They spawn around Normal trees on the ground
[2:16:35] <%holydeviant1> Its hard to find sometimes
[2:16:36] <Dopamien> @andre11dr that snipe was undesereved KKona 7
[2:16:37] <xDartuzax> Limgrave
[2:16:39] <%crybirb> finished the entire game without using a single resin, i have the goblins about using resources
[2:16:39] <Jerp> huh, I found a bunch
[2:16:39] <bamith23> They're just on the ground, they actually look like the gold tinged poop
[2:16:43] <%andre11dr> Just look for trees lol
[2:16:43] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus There is a good farm stop next to "Warmaster's Shack"
[2:16:48] <QueequegTheater> *spot
[2:16:50] <Aussie_Manny> Okay, THIS is a part that annoys be with its vagueness.
[2:16:51] <+aspirationdeath> @breakfastsampler preparing for the absolute worst of presumably adult chatters doesnt preclude hoping for a modecum of decency
[2:16:57] <%Juriasu> mostly see them in the catacombs
[2:16:57] <T_Sasquatch> Elden Snail
[2:17:00] <TheMadDemoknight> Like blood mixed with grease fat?
[2:17:01] <Aussie_Manny> Don't die this time, hopefully.
[2:17:04] <%holydeviant1> @QueequegTheater SPOILERS, SPOILERS, HE SHOULD BE FREE TOMDISCOVER THAT SPOILERS
[2:17:06] <dralakbadusk> LETS GOOOO
[2:17:10] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @pubstar_ltd I find that take of u still being able to take no damage very hard to believe. But fine. We'll just have to wait for those "No damage" runs in the future.
[2:17:12] <%andre11dr> @dopamien Yeah, still kinda funny tho
[2:17:17] <%funya_rinpa> Bro, shut up already, everyone else has moved on, lol
[2:17:20] <iacus_> why fight on the stairs tho, way less area
[2:17:24] <Johannen> Most of my root resin comes from underground dungeons
[2:17:26] <Aussie_Manny> HE DID THE COUNTER?!
[2:17:30] <%oda_flobunaga> Man, Woolie should really use this thing's move more
[2:17:32] <dralakbadusk> yep
[2:17:33] <+Jiggisnipe> will Woolie lose again? Kappa
[2:17:34] <+Amaideus> Enemies don't have pluge attacks do they
[2:17:36] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater You have to be 13 years old to use this website
[2:17:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that somehowe missed
[2:17:39] <%JetpackMcQuack> he studied
[2:17:42] <+TopTieramisu> oh shit, it's this ash of war
[2:17:42] <%pauperofthesouth> you got em
[2:17:43] <Aussie_Manny> Tricky bitch!
[2:17:45] <bamith23> Does the Bloody Slash move actually have a stab like he does? I only remember finding the slash.
[2:17:46] <slix3431> @Jiggisnipe Woolie will figure it out
[2:17:47] <velgaduere> let's GOOOOOOO
[2:17:47] <Jerp> I still have yet to try doing a guard counter on a guard counter

[2:18:09] <Dopamien> @andre11dr shitposting of all kinds is always welcome peepoHappy
[2:18:10] <perfect_disaster> that move is amazing I use it all the time
[2:18:14] <bamith23> It actually works like Mortal Blade in Sekiro, but not as crazy lol
[2:18:14] <Pubstar_LTD> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy I dont understand how thats hard to believe ngl, no boss I have fought was unreadable
[2:18:17] <%holydeviant1> @QueequegTheater BY YOUR OWN LOGIC IT IS STOP IT
[2:18:31] <Aussie_Manny> A worthy prize.
[2:18:33] <emptyantics> @holydeviant1 Calm down bro
[2:18:34] <%Juriasu> bloody slash carried me for a while lol
[2:18:36] <@Solidus_113> POWER
[2:18:37] <%MajorCrasher> bruh chill
[2:18:37] <wandelmilch> become ANIME
[2:18:40] <%crybirb> @QueequegTheater chat is unhinged today
[2:18:40] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater No it isn't.  He knows they exist already.
[2:18:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> blood everywhere
[2:18:42] <MyNameIsRasus> That's the good one
[2:18:42] <%HollowedIdjit> SEKIROOOO
[2:18:45] <%oda_flobunaga> And knifes
[2:18:46] <Aussie_Manny> I'mma guess it drains your HP.
[2:18:48] <%parazoa42> Cainhurst shit
[2:18:49] <+Blue256> thats the good shit
[2:18:49] <+Dakuu75> best ash
[2:18:49] <+solzan2000> sounds like that bloodborne move
[2:18:51] <%holydeviant1> @QueequegTheater He knew this art exists
[2:18:52] <bamith23> RIP Bloody Zweihander
[2:18:54] <emptyantics> SEKIRO SLASH BABY
[2:18:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> BLUD
[2:18:55] <athuramn> whoa whoa whoa, you can organize by acquisition?? I'm dumb
[2:18:56] <%okuriskyles> what happened to the bot that told people to stop yelling, i miss that guy
[2:18:57] <MrMoonGoose> @Aussie_Manny You'd be right
[2:18:59] <%sirisvirus> very good ash
[2:18:59] <+0neReeler> test it
[2:19:02] <%HollowedIdjit> It does
[2:19:02] <+CrystalTree07> it does
[2:19:02] <+pectusumbra> I assume blood affinity it bleed
[2:19:03] <MyNameIsRasus> It super does
[2:19:03] <+TopTieramisu> it's very very good
[2:19:03] <Dannzzyy> Bloody slash soo good.
[2:19:04] <+Nyanlathotep> It bleeds like crazy
[2:19:04] <agustorm123> Is good
[2:19:06] <+Amaideus> It should if you make it Bleed
[2:19:12] <user_naim> also went on my twinblade
[2:19:12] <%sirisvirus> a little life
[2:19:13] <%crybirb> takes almost nothing of life
[2:19:14] <MrMoonGoose> @WoolieVersus It does not add to blood buildup and does take a small amount of HP
[2:19:14] <stormhawk9891> It takes a small bit
[2:19:16] <+Jiggisnipe> @okuriskyles moobot is still here
[2:19:17] <Aussie_Manny> What's that smell? That sweet stench... Hooo, it sings to me... Enough to make a man sick...
[2:19:19] <+DrFacilier> Video game complete, this is all u need
[2:19:19] <+Amaideus> Though I'm not sure if you can change the WA on this weapon
[2:19:21] <yukichocomilk> that ash is SO STRONG
[2:19:26] <%CisealNine> Into the lab we go... later!
[2:19:29] <emptyantics> What‚Äôs that smell? That sweet stench... Hooo, it sings to me... Enough to make a man sick...
[2:19:30] <%okuriskyles> well moobot needs to keep up
[2:19:32] <+Proxzo> Cant put it on Blood Hound right?
[2:19:36] <%okuriskyles> no
[2:19:36] <dralakbadusk> @amaideus  you cant
[2:19:38] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The blood has to come from somewhere
[2:19:38] <%Juriasu> ash of war on bloodhound is good oo though
[2:19:48] <+0neReeler> blood vials?
[2:19:48] <zenith0111> @drfacilier Just ignore that trio boss immune to cut and status
[2:19:48] <+Dakuu75> So, the actual ash-attack doesn't cause bleed. But it'll give your weapon more bleed if you go that way
[2:19:51] <Dopamien> No üò°
[2:19:57] <%Theycallmenerf> Has Woolie beaten a boss?
[2:19:57] <+volitzern> It refunds on hit according to my friend, but it does take health lol
[2:19:58] <stuffamiriteyea> no help from friend
[2:20:07] <perfect_disaster> just walk away LUL
[2:20:10] <%okuriskyles> woolie has beaten several bosses
[2:20:11] <%sewermonk> its a cheater message
[2:20:12] <user_naim> cold as ice
[2:20:15] <+Byr0nX> a pity message
[2:20:15] <bamith23> Did Woolie actually find the NPC associated with the fort last session?
[2:20:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> Vote message cheese
[2:20:16] <%MajorCrasher> nah, he's just farming appraisals lol
[2:20:17] <%okuriskyles> just not any of the "big" ones
[2:20:19] <%andre11dr> I love how chat i soo heated about spoilers in a stream where the streamers aren't looking at the chat for like  80% of the time LUL
[2:20:19] <badugidugi> peeping tom
[2:20:25] <+Amaideus> @Theycallmenerf Not on stream live, he did off stream and showed us earlier
[2:20:26] <%funya_rinpa> There's so much nonsense with max appraisals
[2:20:27] <QueequegTheater> Yeah I'm done dealing with this, blocked
[2:20:27] <%shakespearo> @Theycallmenerf a bunch of non-major ones, but no big'uns iirc
[2:20:30] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[2:20:30] <+Das_Prints> @bamith23 he did.
[2:20:31] <+0neReeler> looks in slit
[2:20:32] <+Vigonept> he begged for it
[2:20:33] <%crybirb> @andre11dr exactly
[2:20:34] <emptyantics> When you have 60 VIT that life for the blooslash isn‚Äôt even noticeable
[2:20:35] <velgaduere> damn chat gets all fucked up whenever there's a new From game huh lmfao
[2:20:46] <+Amaideus> I don't think there's a way to cheat the upvote system
[2:20:48] <%livlinn> woolieONEGUY
[2:20:48] <bamith23> Can't even start the damn game with mods on sad pepe
[2:20:54] <zenith0111> I was legit on Ps4 playing against a guy on 2 accounts as he invaded himself
[2:20:58] <Aussie_Manny> what a thrill
[2:21:00] <+Jiggisnipe> ?
[2:21:03] <iacus_> lmao
[2:21:05] <@Menitta> I love the messages people put by finagling jumping on stuff
[2:21:08] <%shakespearo> @zenith0111 don't trust anybody, not even yourself
[2:21:08] <+0neReeler> no torches?
[2:21:10] <FrostedZaibatsu> I do miss the icons for messages, instead of numbers
[2:21:12] <Aussie_Manny> with darkness and silence through the ni- oh we're here.
[2:21:15] <emptyantics> @zenith0111 How does that even work LUL
[2:21:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:21:26] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @pubstar_ltd I've already said a few minutes ago that it's not necessarily the entire boss fight thats the problem, but the problematic "free hits" which said bosses have that have no clear tells or windups that are lightning-fast
[2:21:27] <%andre11dr> Get em high
[2:21:31] <%shakespearo> Dicktus Medal acquired
[2:21:32] <dralakbadusk> The First part! yay
[2:21:34] <+orochiblood> dicktgus
[2:21:35] <+Amaideus> The icon does change, but not as much
[2:21:35] <%pauperofthesouth> precious item
[2:21:36] <zenith0111> @emptyantics He was forcing pvp. One account to summon co-op signs and the other to fight
[2:21:36] <%oda_flobunaga> Now, get the Right one LUL
[2:21:37] <iacus_> key item
[2:21:38] <%crybirb> i got two messages 2k+ upvotes and my game was f'up, it was triggering in bulks
[2:21:41] <emptyantics> Ayyy
[2:21:41] <QueequegTheater> @emptyantics 1 copy gets you both PS4 and PS5 versions
[2:21:42] <+Byr0nX> deez medalion
[2:21:48] <Aussie_Manny> (Left) Yes, well we know it was left. Question is by who? ü§î
[2:21:51] <emptyantics> @queequegtheater Ohhh ok
[2:21:51] <+El_Rabbit> Bigus Dickus Medallion
[2:21:51] <KingOfTheGeats> good luck getting the other half
[2:21:54] <%JetpackMcQuack> there's a lot of bullshit
[2:21:55] <+GilroyGoldBlood> 100 hours in and I still haven't found the right half
[2:22:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> visions of necessary item
[2:22:08] <FrostedZaibatsu> Newest ones are at the bottom @WoolieVersus
[2:22:13] <%RemedyofRevenge> when you pick up an item, it tells you want section it can be found in
[2:22:17] <+aspirationdeath> @queequegtheater dont you think that an adult who manages his own content as a business would be capable of asking his followers or people in the know himself for farming spots should he need them? no one asked to hear from you no one wants to hear from you.
[2:22:21] <bamith23> Yaaaaaay, my tip is sorta saving time
[2:22:23] <Aussie_Manny> Wait, is Woolie NOT using the Skeleton Warriors this whole time??
[2:22:28] <Pubstar_LTD> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy I mean people will just bait out favorable attacks and only react on those, jump attacks for example
[2:22:29] <%shakespearo> Access to the persona plateau
[2:22:37] <emptyantics> Can‚Äôt wait for him to make it to [REDACTED] area!
[2:22:49] <+Grayhammatter> access to atlus PogChamp
[2:23:01] <Frazbeee> farum azula i guess
[2:23:06] <agustorm123> Redacted is a great boss in the redacted area that‚Äôs unlock redacted weapon
[2:23:07] <%andre11dr> Access to the deckus
[2:23:08] <SoaringTrumpet> I recently found the other half of this medallion but already forgot where lol
[2:23:13] <%shakespearo> if you are in europe, you have top wait for 14 months after getting both halves, because Atlus hates us
[2:23:15] <%oda_flobunaga> Just wait till Q and Jon Snow show up
[2:23:19] <QueequegTheater> @aspirationdeath Obvious sockpuppet, bye bye
[2:23:22] <+Amaideus> Just wait, within a year we'll have people doing no-hit all boss runs
[2:23:23] <%andre11dr> The ancient deckus of the bafmodads
[2:23:25] <Mitchellsocks> 8 LP episodes and they're still in Limgrave good god this game is massive
[2:23:26] <athuramn> @aspirationdeath excuse you?
[2:23:26] <emptyantics> @shakespearo LUL NotLikeThis
[2:23:29] <Dopamien> @aspirationdeath calm down dude
[2:23:35] <velgaduere> so if you take that lift, you get to see Persona 6? nice, can't wait for another game in the series to invent a new genre of music PogBones
[2:23:53] <agustorm123> Big toxic today ehh chat
[2:24:00] <+TopTieramisu> limgrave is very big
[2:24:02] <+aspirationdeath> meant the tone to be more matter of fact than vicious lol my bad
[2:24:07] <zenith0111> I love that P5 invented Jazz @velgaduere
[2:24:09] <crimsonharvest> try horse?
[2:24:11] <+Fetrigon> "full continent" OMEGALUL
[2:24:13] <QueequegTheater> @agustorm123 It's a Fromsoft day, so yes
[2:24:22] <%shakespearo> @agustorm123 I mean it's really only a handful of people slinging shit at each other
[2:24:27] <velgaduere> @zenith0111 what's jazz? are you talking about "Persona 5 music"?
[2:24:27] <KasiCrafter> When in doubt, Rainbow Gem
[2:24:32] <yukichocomilk> a snake eater if you will
[2:24:38] <bamith23> The Surge 2 had a banner system where you could hide them in the environment for.... reasons. Be sorta nice to be able to do the same with special messages lol
[2:24:42] <KingOfTheGeats> fall damage is inconsistent in this game
[2:24:48] <%shakespearo> favourite message is when anyone leaves "visions of snake" in front of a long ladder
[2:24:54] <bamith23> Then I could make proper use of my sick parkour skillz
[2:25:06] <+Amaideus> @shakespearo I climbed a long one and at the top there was a message saying "good job, snake"
[2:25:09] <%pauperofthesouth> risky
[2:25:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> shorty Kappa
[2:25:17] <%andre11dr> Nah just do a flip ,it will be fine
[2:25:17] <agustorm123> Ohh someone remind him to be back tho
[2:25:18] <MrMoonGoose> Rainbow stones are essential
[2:25:22] <%funya_rinpa> snake?, snake!
[2:25:26] <MovieHipster> 160 hours deep and I still have like 5 areas left undiscovered
[2:25:33] <bamith23> @shakespearo The one that is maybe 3x as long as the ladder in Darkroot garden?
[2:25:40] <athuramn> 160, woof
[2:25:41] <luftraumm1> parkour?
[2:25:46] <%andre11dr> @moviehipster Just 5? You wish
[2:25:49] <%shakespearo> @shakespearo I dunno, I have seen it in front of several ladders
[2:25:53] <masterofskillz1> I just can't wait for Woolie to get more comfortable using the weapon arts, so much cool stuff in that system this time around
[2:25:57] <agustorm123> That‚Äôs not even snail pace
[2:26:03] <zenith0111> @moviehipster Just wait till you get to the third planet in the second galaxy Kappa
[2:26:10] <MovieHipster> NotLikeThis
[2:26:16] <athuramn> LUL
[2:26:21] <+benbag13> theres a missing item
[2:26:25] <dralakbadusk> 80 hour in and i just discovered that i have a remove cape option  :v
[2:26:39] <%shakespearo> @zenith0111 when you beat the Elden Four, you can go to Kanto and beat the gym leaders there, too LUL
[2:26:40] <%hax_metatron> This a baby tutorial castle with the blood stuff as reward, and Kenneth‚Äôs small quest. That‚Äôs about it. The blood guy is the one that took over his castle.
[2:26:40] <@Solidus_113> Trusting Souls Kappa
[2:26:40] <Aussie_Manny> The Pickle that was Promised... doodSad
[2:26:41] <+Captain_sevatar> but capes though
[2:26:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> did that say Licky pickle? LUL
[2:26:47] <+badhaye> areas clean ur good
[2:26:48] <+theoldone001> If you change your world Tendency you will find Solaire on there.
[2:26:53] <yukichocomilk> why would you ever remove the cape
[2:27:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> Like 80% of messages are fake
[2:27:05] <martinhadameme> I beat the game at 80 and did every optional boss and still felt burnt out by the end. idk how some people can do 200 hours in 3 weeks and not feel burnt out
[2:27:05] <emptyantics> Tfw no pickle PoroSad
[2:27:09] <athuramn> lol elden baby's first castle
[2:27:10] <%pi_in_the_sci> can you jump on that stone lip out there?
[2:27:12] <%pauperofthesouth> He doesn't know LUL
[2:27:15] <%funya_rinpa> I didn't get into the habit of using skills much until I picked up Moonveil, and now I know how sick they are
[2:27:18] <+ShadowRFox> so to get over there, I believe you got to hop on the wall then run along it I believe. Been a while
[2:27:20] <%andre11dr> I mean i first saw Stormveil castle after 35 hours, it was not as challenging as it was probably supposed to be LUL
[2:27:26] <Aussie_Manny> I assume so.
[2:27:28] <+Jiggisnipe> I mean he killed you Kappa
[2:27:29] <@Solidus_113> he's the boss of this gym
[2:27:29] <Aussie_Manny> He was a tough mofo.
[2:27:30] <agustorm123> Kinda
[2:27:32] <%X2Eliah> just a sidequest woolie
[2:27:37] <%akajaybay> I miss being able to ignore all the hidden path messages now that I've actually run into some illusion walls
[2:27:37] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @pubstar_ltd But that shits tedious and unfun man. I shouldnt have to completely rely on luck and hope that they don't do the bullshit moves that cannot be avoided. If u want a clearer explanation of this problem, I recommend watching PlagueOfGripes latest video. Cos he puts it into words that I cannot.
[2:27:38] <perfect_disaster> pretty much
[2:27:39] <%hax_metatron> It‚Äôs one of the tutorial bosses
[2:27:39] <agustorm123> Just a dude
[2:27:40] <+Amaideus> Little pond
[2:27:40] <KingOfTheGeats> he was pretty tough though
[2:27:41] <emptyantics> Tutorial castle üè∞
[2:27:41] <+Dakuu75> No boss? hmmm? No boss?
[2:27:43] <+benbag13> there's a missing item
[2:27:43] <tentavision> No bosses?
[2:27:43] <Aussie_Manny> No Bosses? wifiSad
[2:27:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no boss? :eyes:
[2:27:52] <Hirumm> one guy
[2:27:55] <emptyantics> No bosses? x1dnslYES
[2:27:58] <%crybirb> @andre11dr I was kinda like that, weeping peninsula full and then I went to godrick. Calid the same, only level 80+ besides Radahn fight which I did at level 20 lol.
[2:28:03] <+orochiblood> boatfuckers
[2:28:04] <+0neReeler> nice boat, boss
[2:28:04] <+robertoszek> boss-less behaviour
[2:28:07] <agustorm123> It doesn‚Äôt count as a boss tho
[2:28:07] <%therustystream> wait you fought a boat guy already?
[2:28:09] <+ShadowRFox> there was a BIG reason for a boat boss
[2:28:10] <apostateCourier> woolie you missed a drop down
[2:28:11] <zenith0111> Mariner is there to help the souls :)
[2:28:12] <Jerp> what if he just liked the tranquility of the lake though?
[2:28:12] <%Prevot> that aint fot no reason
[2:28:13] <apostateCourier> on the fort
[2:28:14] <Aussie_Manny> I like this fort. It's a good kinda tutorial area, if you run into it early.
[2:28:15] <+ShadowRFox> you just haven't seen it yet
[2:28:22] <%pauperofthesouth> boat guy is a quest. you missed meeting D there
[2:28:24] <%shakespearo> @ShadowRFox it was part of the recap off between-session stuff, ye
[2:28:24] <+benbag13> on the top floor there's a missing item
[2:28:34] <+tempestzephyr> weapon ash of war
[2:28:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[2:28:37] <%therustystream> Did fort haight already happen?
[2:28:39] <apostateCourier> er wait not fort morne nm
[2:28:44] <+TopTieramisu> let's goooo
[2:28:45] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can find root resin in gargoyle dungeons near roots
[2:28:48] <@Menitta> Fort....night
[2:28:48] <athuramn> @woolieversus the symbol that shows you that you can summon is almost always an indicator for boss or large mobs. when it's not present, it's safer to assume you've cleared the present threat
[2:28:48] <%crybirb> @therustystream ye just happened
[2:28:49] <+Amaideus> We just spent like 40 minutes there
[2:28:53] <%shakespearo> @therustystream he just finished it and is leaving it
[2:28:57] <%crybirb> @Menitta fort, afternoon?
[2:28:59] <Frazbeee> @therustystream just now did it
[2:29:00] <%therustystream> word ty guys
[2:29:06] <emptyantics> What‚Äôs that smell‚Ä¶
[2:29:07] <viciousgrim> did he try talking to the beast again?
[2:29:09] <SpurtFire> fort... evening?
[2:29:10] <+TopTieramisu> you can't put it on your current sword
[2:29:14] <+Amaideus> @WoolieVersus This weapon can't change its weapon art
[2:29:23] <apostateCourier> @athuramn that's the shrine of merika, which is a respawn point not a summon pool
[2:29:23] <%andre11dr> @emptyantics Is it crack?
[2:29:36] <agustorm123> Ohh so we are going full blood?
[2:29:46] <%crybirb> the funniest sequence of messages I had was in a place where it was "fort, morning?" "fort, evening..." and then "fort, night!" by 3 different players in sequence
[2:29:48] <%therustystream> damn that's some good impact on the heavy
[2:29:52] <+aspirationdeath> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy you keep bringing up plague, but he himself has admitted several times that hes not a skilled player and he has disdain for the design philosophy of slowly learning fights to overcome them. why would you take criticisms from that guy seriously on a souls game?
[2:29:52] <+0neReeler> embue power
[2:29:53] <joyfulbastion> Drive
[2:29:54] <MyNameIsRasus> chat, is there enough shit in the game for a dex arc build?
[2:29:58] <$oFlooofy> DRIVE
[2:30:00] <%mr_sups> Goldlight Greatsword
[2:30:00] <Jerp> and leaves the sword buffed, it looks like?
[2:30:09] <%crybirb> @MyNameIsRasus yes theres a katana just for that
[2:30:11] <+ShadowRFox> no lie, that ash have taken me through a good chunk of the game
[2:30:12] <+Amaideus> @MyNameIsRasus one of the first invaders drops a arcane dagger
[2:30:13] <MrMoonGoose> HOLY DRIVER
[2:30:13] <%holydeviant1> Really handy for undead, also for bypassing phys damage reduction
[2:30:14] <athuramn> @apostatecourier I'm talking about the purple icon on the left that only comes up when you haven't cleared a boss or large mob
[2:30:17] <zenith0111> @mynameisrasus Dex and Arc are very common to see together
[2:30:18] <%Majkir> @MyNameIsRasus Dex Arc works well for bleed builds
[2:30:18] <athuramn> not the same
[2:30:18] <%mr_sups> Mortally Challenged
[2:30:21] <QueequegTheater> TWLODs
[2:30:25] <MyNameIsRasus> fucking sick
[2:30:26] <+Nyanlathotep> @MyNameIsRasus ARC scales like shit into the late game, but if you have a weapion with bleed, it'
[2:30:26] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> mortally challenged
[2:30:27] <luftraumm1> pat commented that weapon arts scale with weapon quality right?
[2:30:28] <+0neReeler> alive impaired
[2:30:28] <%Bread_Assassin> People of dead
[2:30:34] <%andre11dr> Damn ,people writing novels in chat today
[2:30:37] <+Nyanlathotep> @MyNameIsRasus s pretty good
[2:30:42] <+Amaideus> But apparently all the weapons with arcane scaling and split damage have the scaling bugged
[2:30:46] <Cymen90> Have they found a purpose for deathbloom yet?
[2:30:46] <+Jiggisnipe> neat
[2:30:47] <%pauperofthesouth> yo
[2:30:48] <QueequegTheater> @MyNameIsRasus ARC is bugged right now, scaling is all fucked up
[2:30:49] <zenith0111> GRAVITY
[2:30:55] <%mr_sups> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[2:30:55] <+TopTieramisu> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[2:30:57] <%Pillagius> "get over here!"
[2:31:00] <%shakespearo> I hope they nerf some shit mid playthrough again, that was really funny in the DS2 LP
[2:31:00] <%crybirb> sadly gravity is str, I wanted to use but I was dex/int
[2:31:01] <MyNameIsRasus> @MyNameIsRasus oof, a shame
[2:31:02] <+0neReeler> try on bird
[2:31:06] <Dopamien> @QueequegTheater how so?
[2:31:06] <NBUsagi> Woolie begins the Gravity arc
[2:31:06] <luftraumm1> [redacted] build
[2:31:06] <perfect_disaster> is reaaaally good
[2:31:07] <agustorm123> Magnetic pulse
[2:31:07] <frickenmoron> Hello Elders, hows the ring
[2:31:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, that looks way bigger in comparison with that guy doing it
[2:31:12] <+Amaideus> The sword also does damage if you plant it on someone @WoolieVersus
[2:31:13] <jacknerik> @Cymen90 Yeah they found the recipe book for blood grease and need sap now
[2:31:15] <agustorm123> Gravity squeeze
[2:31:17] <%shakespearo> @frickenmoron bleeding, right now
[2:31:18] <%holydeviant1> Reggie is correct, first pulse is a stagger, the second yanks
[2:31:21] <+Amaideus> So if you're right in their face it'll get an extra hit in
[2:31:23] <%oda_flobunaga> There have always been weapons that don't scale in these games.  Are dragon weapons in DS1 bugged?
[2:31:24] <+daemonazaezal> isnt that just almighty pull from the rinnegan?
[2:31:26] <Dopamien> @QueequegTheater with arc being bugged
[2:31:26] <+Jiggisnipe> nice

[2:31:44] <+Emperor_Machinus> rice
[2:31:48] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> ITS WORTH IT THO
[2:31:51] <Dannzzyy> Bloody slash with blood scaling is nutty.
[2:31:51] <crimsonharvest> hit a sheep or something with it
[2:31:52] <+0neReeler> now see how much on a guy
[2:31:54] <SmortyPuffin> boy is it
[2:31:55] <perfect_disaster> it is
[2:31:55] <NBUsagi> Woolie skipped Virgil and went straight to Nagoryuki
[2:31:55] <+TopTieramisu> it's very strong
[2:31:56] <%therustystream> BLOODY SLASH IS BROKE ON DEX
[2:31:57] <%oda_flobunaga> IT FRACKIN IS
[2:31:57] <wandelmilch> It's worthy
[2:31:57] <+Grayhammatter> apparently it's worth it
[2:31:57] <+Nyanlathotep> The damage on that is bonkers
[2:31:58] <KingOfTheGeats> its broken
[2:31:58] <+DrFacilier> IT SUPER IS
[2:31:58] <zenith0111> Its beyond worth
[2:31:58] <%Xelhesia> damage is real good
[2:31:59] <Dopamien> @QueequegTheater oh right I noticed that
[2:31:59] <%Majkir> That 69 can increase with weapon upgrade and Arcane. I got this sword to over 120 bleed buildup by endgame.
[2:32:01] <agustorm123> It damage itself
[2:32:03] <reasonance> there's so many BUSTED weapon arts in this game
[2:32:08] <%holydeviant1> ...Can you kill yourself with it?
[2:32:09] <Frazbeee> SO much damage tho
[2:32:11] <%crybirb> I miss CHIKAGE so MUUUUCH
[2:32:12] <+Iamdenril> it does kill you.... i found out
[2:32:13] <+DrFacilier> This saved my fuckin life in the early game
[2:32:13] <%Bread_Assassin> It that a set amount of life or does it scale with vigor?
[2:32:16] <%andre11dr> I decided going str arc , i basically ended up with a warlock type caracter
[2:32:17] <MrMoonGoose> @holydeviant1 Yeh
[2:32:18] <QueequegTheater> It's fine, Woolsworth is O-
[2:32:18] <martinhadameme> Arc scaling will surely be patched, after all it's not like From has a history of leaving gamebreaking scaling bugs in their games :tf:
[2:32:20] <+solzan2000> the weps in this game <3
[2:32:20] <Iza_kku> @holydeviant1 hell yeah you can
[2:32:21] <NBUsagi> Can we get this man a katana
[2:32:21] <%therustystream> @holydeviant1 probably lol
[2:32:23] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @aspirationdeath If that's the case then how the fuck is DS1 one of his favourite games?! Cos many bosses (especially artorias and Manus) require you do exactly that!
[2:32:23] <+Captain_sevatar> this game has a lot of cool shit
[2:32:25] <%crybirb> @holydeviant1 yes every self inflicted damage in the game is suicidable
[2:32:25] <@Menitta> yes. yes you can YOU VERY MUCH CAN
[2:32:26] <%NopeBadguy> yo is that the fucking mortal slash animation

[2:37:39] <%andre11dr> Yeah i decided to not worry about the ending, I'll get what i get
[2:37:40] <agustorm123> Is this a motherfucking GOT reference?
[2:37:46] <velgaduere> >chat assuming Woolie and Reggie don't read chat again
[2:37:47] <+eanscrale> don't be absurd, lips aren't real
[2:37:51] <velgaduere> how many times do you have to be told
[2:37:54] <Dopamien> lmao if npcs walk or do anything in real time I get worried
[2:37:55] <+HairyWario> are people speed running this game? How are people looking for a 7th ending? I'm barely out of the first castle after 30 hours.
[2:37:56] <dralakbadusk> I haven't even finished my first playthrough and THERES SEVEN ENDINGS!?
[2:37:57] <athuramn> @velgaduere ikr lmao
[2:37:59] <zero2700> the elden ring is the friends we made along the way
[2:38:05] <+theoldone001> Characters lips moving is like a huge big deal in these games lol
[2:38:06] <+Tuffty> Yeah a guy at work playing it was stunned when I told him how you had to talk to NPC's multiple times first.
[2:38:10] <%pauperofthesouth> I didn't understand this
[2:38:13] <%shakespearo> the elden ring is the one piece
[2:38:22] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The dead giant in the court yard
[2:38:25] <+Jiggisnipe> @velgaduere so the highlight is so other chat members see it?
[2:38:29] <krampus2> i dont think ghost change
[2:38:30] <Johannen> They dont update
[2:38:32] <AwesomeInABox> i feel like the ghosts in this game are all frozen in time
[2:38:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> God imagine if this game had full on NPC schedules on top of everything else you had to keep track of
[2:38:38] <stuffamiriteyea> he's in the fort
[2:38:38] <MyNameIsRasus> ghosts are constant
[2:38:40] <%therustystream> @shakespearo I thought it was when you raise your hands above your head and make a circle
[2:38:40] <%hax_metatron> These ghosts are flavor text for the area that‚Äôs it.
[2:38:43] <%andre11dr> @shakespearo Which is the friends we made along the way
[2:38:50] <velgaduere> @Jiggisnipe sorry, I'm not sure I understand what you're asking exactly
[2:38:59] <%pauperofthesouth> hostility gone LUL
[2:39:03] <%holydeviant1> Well, woolie, most horses can't double jump

[2:39:21] <iacus_> gentrified
[2:39:21] <emptyantics> Torrent is best boi
[2:39:22] <%holydeviant1> So about those demihumans
[2:39:25] <+aspirationdeath> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy this game with the addition of stakes that make runbacks instantaneous and summons that make fights easier they clearly felt liberated to make bosses demand way more precision. thats plague poison. he has no patience for that shit.
[2:39:26] <MyNameIsRasus> chest high walls op
[2:39:27] <agustorm123> Woolie need to see that video LUL
[2:39:28] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Wrong neighborhood MF!!!
[2:39:30] <%shakespearo> @velgaduere Ackchually, Luffy makes nakama, not friends, which is not the same thing at all LUL
[2:39:30] <Cymen90> He wanted to negotiate wit hthe demi-humans. Negotiations were SHORT! LUL
[2:39:36] <%Deasmeister> demi humans
[2:39:37] <Aussie_Manny> SKELETON WARRIORS
[2:39:38] <dralakbadusk> REALLY SHORT

[2:39:46] <+Grayhammatter> skeleton WARRIORS!
[2:39:47] <zenith0111> The skeletons are so good
[2:39:47] <velgaduere> @velgaduere I am... even more confused lmao
[2:39:49] <%hax_metatron> The demi humans CANNOT be negotiated with LUL
[2:39:52] <+Amaideus> Love me some zomboids
[2:39:53] <agustorm123> Good ol change of administration
[2:39:54] <+Jiggisnipe> @velgaduere LUL sorry I was asking a sarcastic question. I feel like people highlight specifically so Woolie or Reggie will see
[2:39:54] <linSP> SAVED
[2:39:59] <%hax_metatron> They‚Äôve suffered far too long under the humans
[2:40:02] <MyNameIsRasus> @Cymen90 "Hello, my name is Kenne-" "RWHAAAAAAAAAARGH"
[2:40:07] <stuffamiriteyea> no more rats so it's easy now
[2:40:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> wtf kenneth
[2:40:14] <TheMadDemoknight> So much for Diplomacy
[2:40:15] <%Deosier> diplomacy has failed
[2:40:30] <%andre11dr> As usual
[2:40:33] <%Gruhunchously> Diplomacy was never an option
[2:40:33] <+Amaideus> Dude my brain is so weird that when the enemies swapped I didn't even realize it was a different set
[2:40:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:40:45] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, uh... did I just kill your guys?
[2:40:47] <+Amaideus> My brain was just like "oh yeah, shitters are still here"
[2:40:51] <MyNameIsRasus> fort, night
[2:40:52] <@Menitta> oooh shoot I need to go back here
[2:40:56] <Aussie_Manny> The sta'e of it
[2:40:57] <velgaduere> @Jiggisnipe well, it did seem to me like they were asking chat directly, but highlighting a spoiler question meant for chat is foolish and will inevitably attract the streamers' eyes
[2:40:59] <SoaringTrumpet> yeah it's not looking so great
[2:41:04] <%pauperofthesouth> I don't want to be King anymore
[2:41:07] <emptyantics> Fort, Night

[2:41:25] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @aspirationdeath Is it poison though? Have you even been watching his playthrough of this game?
[2:41:28] <@Solidus_113> so no one can figure out how to get his quest past this point. It's weird.
[2:41:30] <xXFlyingBrickXx> Jebaited

[2:41:36] <perfect_disaster> see? he is not that bad

[2:41:41] <SoaringTrumpet> Jebaited
[2:41:42] <@Irridium> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy take it to PM's if you want to keep talking about this
[2:41:44] <Aussie_Manny> I guess that's it?
[2:41:44] <MyNameIsRasus> community is legit stumped at his quest
[2:41:46] <+Jiggisnipe> @velgaduere ok yea I can see that. Just people not unaware of their actions again
[2:41:46] <+Kyma1020> ah another disappointing rich guy
[2:41:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this guy would say "Ore sama" in a JP dub LUL LUL
[2:41:53] <TheMadDemoknight> Woolie. keep an eye on that
[2:41:54] <%Prevot> he talked shit and immediately backed down
[2:41:56] <zenith0111> I like how the world is in chaos and hes like "Limgrave tho"
[2:41:58] <Aussie_Manny> Maybe they came in afterward?
[2:42:00] <valriot> Yeah, noone has a single idea what to do with this guy now LUL
[2:42:05] <AllenDeadman> we have no idea how this questline continues if it does at all
[2:42:07] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gotta find a new true ruler
[2:42:07] <QueequegTheater> He used "Throw Coin" to distract them
[2:42:07] <SoaringTrumpet> you got fooled post-haste
[2:42:09] <velgaduere> @Jiggisnipe exactly, it's not hard to be mindful or conscientious
[2:42:11] <%pauperofthesouth> you can go
[2:42:11] <Aussie_Manny> I wish we could high-five summonses.

[2:42:40] <Frostilk> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ oh shit, it has a JP dub? neat
[2:42:43] <@Solidus_113> that's a good one
[2:42:44] <%MajorCrasher> just speculating because I know nothing here but maybe you come back after beating Godrick?
[2:42:44] <user_naim> I would like this dude to be played by Neal McDonough in a lovie
[2:42:44] <iacus_> YE YE YE
[2:42:45] <%DkLordG> hey all, I just woke up, what's happened so far?
[2:42:47] <zenith0111> Do you guys think we need to summon someone by him? Im legit curious how to prog it
[2:42:55] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater Fuck, that's genius
[2:42:58] <%shakespearo> @DkLordG recap and fort haight
[2:43:02] <+sambws> Some ppl think the quest is glitched
[2:43:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Frostilk oh no, no, I was moreso saying an imagined JP dub
[2:43:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> im at the end-game and i still dont know how to get Kenneth off his ass
[2:43:11] <velgaduere> @user_naim that's a very specific desire that I resonate with
[2:43:22] <%Hfranccc> Hfranccc subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:43:26] <+HairyWario> so crazy nobody knows where else Kenneth is
[2:43:40] <agustorm123> Probably you need a gesture of some kind
[2:43:42] <Frostilk> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ aw ok LUL
[2:43:43] <+aspirationdeath> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy ive been playing through it myself with dex/int spellword no blocking no parrying pure rolling.
[2:43:48] <%shakespearo> I assumed that was just all there is to kenneth, but appearantly not??
[2:43:55] <w_khan> ah the shitty shield returns
[2:43:57] <Aussie_Manny> That shield looks like a piece of shit.
[2:44:10] <stuffamiriteyea> use something else lmao
[2:44:11] <velgaduere> LUL
[2:44:12] <@DashXero> Dang.
[2:44:17] <%Pillagius> lol
[2:44:18] <zenith0111> "Shit Shield"
[2:44:21] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:44:24] <MyNameIsRasus> @shakespearo apparently dataminers found more shit to this quest. it's just no one knows how to get there
[2:44:25] <%alloVera> it's just like me fr
[2:44:26] <xXFlyingBrickXx> "This be trash."
[2:44:27] <+Proxzo> is there a way to check in-game what the status effects are on your character? I only know through the wiki.
[2:44:27] <+Amaideus> "Bro this sucks, why are you even looking at it"
[2:44:34] <emptyantics> ‚ÄúCaca shield‚Äù
[2:44:35] <velgaduere> "if you need to equip this shield, you're already dead"
[2:44:35] <Aussie_Manny> Engenders being a weak little bitch.
[2:44:47] <%shakespearo> @Proxzo I don't think there is a description beyond the icons under your stamina
[2:44:57] <+Proxzo> that's really ...obtuse
[2:45:02] <%shakespearo> yeah, it's great
[2:45:05] <%Pillagius> a lot of newbies died here...
[2:45:10] <Aussie_Manny> Surely all these bloodstains are from weak ass noobs.
[2:45:18] <velgaduere> lmao that message
[2:45:21] <%pauperofthesouth> oh this is a battle
[2:45:22] <+Amaideus> You can tell what's on you from the icons, but not what the actual effect is without testing
[2:45:26] <stuffamiriteyea> friend
[2:45:27] <@Solidus_113> that's an NPC
[2:45:29] <Aussie_Manny> Time for pair
[2:45:30] <velgaduere> sick
[2:45:30] <+Proxzo> like it'd make sense if we could check our status to see what these buffs n debuffs are
[2:45:31] <%shakespearo> oh? I missed this NPC
[2:45:34] <%whyskeywolfe> Jolly Cooperation!
[2:45:35] <%Prevot> what I never saw that
[2:45:38] <athuramn> you're gonna go through half the game before you figure out what some of those status symbols mean lol @proxzo
[2:45:38] <%Reveresao> Hey, mods where are the channel points bets?
[2:45:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> I just found a massive underground area in limgrave I had no idea existed NotLikeThis
[2:45:38] <AllenDeadman> oh... I never saw this NPC summon
[2:45:39] <QueequegTheater> 40k PogChap
[2:45:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Wow, you can summon him here?
[2:45:41] <berasite> Did woolie check the weapon he got?
[2:45:44] <QueequegTheater> 40k PogChamp
[2:45:44] <Aussie_Manny> Free summon! No cost! khadPog
[2:45:44] <zenith0111> Wait you dont think?
[2:45:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> totally missed this npc wow
[2:45:52] <zenith0111> Talk to kenny after this
[2:45:54] <%pauperofthesouth> @Prevot because people put their own msgs on top prolly
[2:45:57] <%shakespearo> @Proxzo it would make sense, but it also makes sense not to tell you
[2:45:58] <velgaduere> you know it's not a player, because "Knight" isn't censored lobosKek
[2:45:58] <iacus_> and you can do ash summons too
[2:45:59] <w_khan> oh this boss
[2:46:07] <Aussie_Manny> BOSS ROOM
[2:46:16] <+Proxzo> Blood damage!
[2:46:16] <%holydeviant1> Yeah, when you just have NPC summons, you can do Ashes
[2:46:18] <+Amaideus> K***ght X is my favorite name meme in souls
[2:46:20] <emptyantics> @velgaduere Knight is censored?!
[2:46:27] <stuffamiriteyea> he's using the gravity art
[2:46:30] <+Amaideus> K***ht*
[2:46:34] <w_khan> walked too close to the second one
[2:46:35] <AllenDeadman> I have his armor, it{s pretty tanky
[2:46:36] <Aussie_Manny> üò©AUGH
[2:46:38] <%holydeviant1> WOO
[2:46:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @MyNameIsRasus
[2:46:41] <velgaduere> @emptyantics some letters in the middle of it historically get censored to hilarious effect
[2:46:42] <%shakespearo> @Amaideus yeah the DS2 word filter was pretty dumb
[2:46:43] <perfect_disaster> he know the secret moves!
[2:46:44] <%SainEdge> this was the first thing i did when i left the tutorial LUL
[2:46:44] <zenith0111> I never seen this dude who is this badass
[2:46:45] <+HairyWario> Woolie moving like artorias over here
[2:46:45] <Aussie_Manny> Hey don't yell
[2:46:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> csbeastYeyeye
[2:46:54] <Blank9> Dark Souls 2 name censors were wild
[2:46:56] <stuffamiriteyea> that's so cool
[2:46:58] <Aussie_Manny> woolieEVIL khadKEK khadKEK khadKEK
[2:46:59] <karawra> i love the weapon woolie uses it's so cool
[2:47:01] <+Jiggisnipe> oh LUL K***ht
[2:47:05] <Hirumm> he hasn't found Boc yet right?
[2:47:05] <T_Sasquatch> This is a cluster fuck
[2:47:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> huge dmg
[2:47:09] <+Vigonept> what a badass
[2:47:12] <+aspirationdeath> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy there are definitely some tedious bosses, especially the duos, with this playstyle. but at no point was there a guaranteed hit against me. it was always subtle spaving mistakes or stamina mismanagement that had waaay higher penalties than in previous games

[2:47:45] <emptyantics> STUNLOCKED
[2:47:45] <zenith0111> Is that the knight kenny is talking about?
[2:47:46] <%hax_metatron> ELDEN RING: BE GOD
[2:47:47] <Frostilk> YO did the old knight use gravitas?
[2:47:52] <%holydeviant1> Do you hate capes? well here is the solution.
[2:47:53] <agustorm123> Is too much bro
[2:47:57] <athuramn> time to sew some shit?
[2:47:57] <%Pillagius> now you can sew holes on your pants yourself!
[2:47:57] <+HairyWario> missed the NPC summon, game's crazy yo
[2:48:05] <%TheHateFish> @shakespearo This is what I was talking about - sorry about that, by the way mods, I honestly wasn't thinking - and if anyone wants to discuss it more, drop me a DM
[2:48:06] <Frazbeee> boc?
[2:48:08] <w_khan> huh i wonder what will hapen now
[2:48:12] <%RyTYoung> What have I missed in the last hour chat? csbeastSetIn

[2:48:17] <velgaduere> dress-up time
[2:48:17] <+Proxzo> Oh is this cosmetics?
[2:48:19] <%MajorCrasher> I had no idea that you could use summons and spirits at the same time
[2:48:20] <Frazbeee> sucks
[2:48:21] <karawra> fashion time
[2:48:21] <athuramn> imagine if you had to repair your clothes NotLikeThis
[2:48:22] <+Order_of_Mystery> Istvan is you in another 15 hours

[2:48:24] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gotta find boc
[2:48:25] <agustorm123> Try once yourself alone always tho
[2:48:29] <+HairyWario> From Software just gave us official Fashion Souls
[2:48:30] <+aspirationdeath> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy i mean you die in one or two hits unless you have like a million vit or heavy ass armor
[2:48:32] <%hax_metatron> No matter what build you play, you can be a high fantasy superhero in this game. From Soft pulling the bait and switch with one of the most fun games to play ever, while also making it difficult
[2:48:33] <+Grayhammatter> gotta find boc i guess
[2:48:34] <%holydeviant1> @MajorCrasher Only NPC summons
[2:48:37] <w_khan> wonder what happens now that you foun the needle before him
[2:48:38] <%Prevot> so woolie hasn't met rat boy yet?
[2:48:40] <linSP> where boc
[2:48:40] <%pauperofthesouth> can we tell him where Boc is?? It's so hard to find otherwise
[2:48:46] <%Lion_kun> Did Woolie mess up the npc quest?
[2:48:47] <@Solidus_113> no
[2:48:58] <+Javaa01> @Prevot Rode past him plenty of times, but no, cause he doesn't know what he'd be looking for
[2:49:15] <%MajorCrasher> @holydeviant1 if I knew that I would have made godrick's life a living hell
[2:49:16] <Aussie_Manny> Try ahead
[2:49:16] <%SveriSageAdvice> if he asks for help, should be fine to tell him then, as for now just leave it lol
[2:49:19] <+Amaideus> I spent 20 hours looking for a greatsword
[2:49:21] <athuramn> guys, this game has lots of failsafes in the event you miss an npc, it's aaaalll good
[2:49:34] <+Amaideus> And it turns out there was one in a chest I'd just missed even though I'd walked by it like 6 times
[2:49:35] <bamith23> Game doesn't evenn have Ray Tracing yet
[2:49:36] <luftraumm1> torch play sounds like a kink
[2:49:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:49:37] <%Prevot> torches are cool
[2:49:38] <zenith0111> These caves are hella dark
[2:49:39] <%JetpackMcQuack> And he‚Äôs right goddammit
[2:49:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, my chat got disabled for a while
[2:49:57] <luftraumm1> torch play sounds like a kink you do ONCE
[2:49:59] <%shakespearo> @athuramn they have improved a lot vis a vis bricking quest lines by doing things out of order since DS1, ye
[2:50:04] <yukichocomilk> lantern is my jam, i activate it everytime

[2:53:30] <agustorm123> Friendo
[2:53:31] <bamith23> I didn't get an option to use another alter elsewhere, I assumed it was cause I didn't have enough dragon skillz
[2:53:34] <Aussie_Manny> This is a cool island.
[2:53:35] <+aspirationdeath> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy but thr compensation for that is the freedom of approach. you can overlevel sooo easy in this game if you really want to. summons are busted.  the hardest bosses are completely off the beaten path and guard late game shit... etc etc.
[2:53:35] <%hax_metatron> DUDE HE cannot use that altar now. Everyone chill
[2:53:41] <MrMoonGoose> peepo
[2:53:41] <@DashXero> Chill, Chat. It's not the end of the world.
[2:53:43] <Aussie_Manny> What was that?
[2:53:46] <+Nyanlathotep> @hax_metatron He absolutely can
[2:53:51] <+Captain_sevatar> He can hax
[2:53:51] <Aussie_Manny> Beneath the ground?
[2:53:51] <@Solidus_113> he hasn't seen a dragon yet
[2:53:52] <agustorm123> He can
[2:53:56] <kinkade_77> Wyverns are dragons change my mind
[2:53:58] <+Order_of_Mystery> the messages are so horny lol
[2:54:04] <w_khan> and then Kratos
[2:54:05] <+JT_Jag> you can use the temple without dragon hearts, it tells you what you need to do
[2:54:06] <ImSincerelySorry> It doesn't matter, if he gets a heart it will tell him to come back
[2:54:07] <Aussie_Manny> Wyverns are bitch-dragons.
[2:54:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Do a flip!
[2:54:08] <@Menitta> Do a flip
[2:54:09] <%TheHateFish> @kinkade_77 Why? You're right
[2:54:13] <bamith23> Dogs are just wingless dragons.
[2:54:17] <%andre11dr> I think you can get it after fighting da thing
[2:54:17] <+Javaa01> @hax_metatron Nope, you can only touch it when you have one to spend, before that, it just does a blank animation
[2:54:17] <+HairyWario> zaddy woolie
[2:54:18] <perfect_disaster> wait has woolie killed the dragon?
[2:54:19] <brunoberserk> DO A FLIP
[2:54:20] <%TheHateFish> They're scrub-tier dragons, but dragons none-the-less
[2:54:23] <athuramn> man who appraised that 5 times so late into the game
[2:54:24] <emptyantics> Wyverns>Wyrms>Drakes>Dragons
[2:54:28] <velgaduere> assumen't
[2:54:28] <agustorm123> Wing rat LUL
[2:54:29] <+Jakeofalco> @WoolieVersus its bugged reload
[2:54:33] <crimsonharvest> yeah do a sit zone reset to use the altar
[2:54:33] <+Ynkubus_> @kinkade_77 wyverns being considered not dragons is a weird modern fiction thing that needs to die
[2:54:34] <@DashXero> @aspirationdeath @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy Could you gents take that discussion to PMs? Thanks.
[2:54:41] <+Captain_sevatar> woolie pls sit at the grace and try again
[2:54:42] <bamith23> I do figure its just cause he hasn't killed a dragon yet.
[2:54:48] <+HairyWario> @perfect_disaster i came here before killing dragon and I could see the shop
[2:54:56] <%TheHateFish> No capes?
[2:54:57] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus so this will usually remove capes from armour
[2:54:58] <%andre11dr> Touch Gracehole
[2:55:05] <iacus_> remove the cape
[2:55:06] <+Amaideus> It makes it lighter too
[2:55:06] <%MajorCrasher> guys chill, it's not that serious to do right now
[2:55:07] <+Vigonept> nah its just bugged
[2:55:08] <velgaduere> @DashXero they were already asked by mods to do so and completely ignored them. I had to block em ResidentSleeper
[2:55:10] <+Amaideus> How nice
[2:55:11] <perfect_disaster> @perfect_disaster oh ok
[2:55:13] <stuffamiriteyea> it just removes the cape

[2:55:21] <+Captain_sevatar> @bamith23 nah you can totally sit there without killing a dragon its just bugged
[2:55:24] <AllenDeadman> you can see it on the preview
[2:55:25] <w_khan> just fashion

[2:55:27] <athuramn> @solidus_113 that took me like, 30 hours to notice csbeastSetIn
[2:55:28] <+HairyWario> stats do change though
[2:55:29] <+Javaa01> This is a Fashion Souls feature
[2:55:30] <MyNameIsRasus> it changes stats
[2:55:30] <%pauperofthesouth> save your runes
[2:55:32] <Dotados> dumbest item in the whole game, capes are rad
[2:55:33] <Dopamien> alter garments, more like make worse üò°
[2:55:33] <+askalta> no it slightly lowers stats including poise.
[2:55:35] <+Kyma1020> no stats just a cap toggle for 500 runes
[2:55:36] <kinkade_77> Wait you can do that?
[2:55:38] <karawra> oh yea stats are different
[2:55:39] <%Pillagius> add/remove cape
[2:55:40] <%Double_Tap_That> @iacus_ It's not, there are slight changes to the stats.
[2:55:44] <+HairyWario> its fashion souls
[2:55:47] <user_naim> The Edna Mode button
[2:55:53] <+Order_of_Mystery> fashion souls ascended
[2:55:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> Certain hoods you find will add their own cloaks if you remove the cloak that comes with the torso piece
[2:55:57] <+Amaideus> "Oh no, I take half a % more damage"
[2:55:57] <emptyantics> It‚Äôs removes 10% of armour and reduces poice by 30%
[2:55:59] <+Kyma1020> like by a few points
[2:56:06] <+badhaye> fashion souls is free. think bloodborne!

[2:56:14] <iacus_> capes are cool
[2:56:14] <MyNameIsRasus> capes rule
[2:56:22] <emptyantics> Capes are fucking sick
[2:56:22] <yukichocomilk> cape is objectively superior
[2:56:23] <+Captain_sevatar> fuck yeah capes are rad
[2:56:23] <AllenDeadman> if you're a little above weight, you can just reduce it by altering it
[2:56:24] <%holydeviant1> If this makes the difference between life and death, it was a razors edge anyway lol
[2:56:27] <athuramn> @indigo_automaton not a spoiler and excellent neat info, much approve üëç
[2:56:27] <MyNameIsRasus> like imagine blaidd with no cape. weak

[2:59:26] <+Amaideus> Technically you never landed, so it thinks you were falling the whole time
[2:59:26] <%Archmortal> it's not even fall damage, the game just decides you've been stuck falling too long so that MUST mean you're going to die
[2:59:26] <Willowight> amazing
[2:59:27] <%pauperofthesouth> Didn't expect tree
[2:59:28] <emptyantics> ELDEN RING

[3:08:01] <%radiorosewater> teaowlBlank
[3:08:04] <%okuriskyles> give torrent a hat you cowards
[3:08:09] <%shakespearo> horse armor could be neat
[3:08:09] <athuramn> nah he's cool as weird goat horse
[3:08:09] <MrMoonGoose> @Amaideus Yes/
[3:08:09] <@Solidus_113> horse armour
[3:08:13] <QueequegTheater> Big ones always drop an ovary
[3:08:14] <shibarks> torrent customization would be tight
[3:08:15] <bamith23> Torrent cosmetics seem like it'll be saved for DLC.
[3:08:20] <+Amaideus> Truly
[3:08:22] <+Amaideus> Full circle
[3:08:25] <+Amaideus> DLC started with horse armor
[3:08:27] <bamith23> Hidden in some cave
[3:08:29] <+Amaideus> And it'll end with horse armor
[3:08:33] <athuramn> Kreygasm
[3:08:40] <bamith23> Through a teleporter that maybe goes to the moon.
[3:08:41] <%okuriskyles> it's like poetry etc etc
[3:08:54] <%MajorCrasher> I love how people were pissed about horse armor when it first appeared but now are unironically asking for it lol
[3:08:57] <+blue_grave> I just wanna be able to pet torrent
[3:09:14] <+Jiggisnipe> @MajorCrasher crazy how times change lol
[3:09:15] <%shakespearo> @MajorCrasher I mean, I don't want it to cost 20 fuckin dollars like the oblivion one
[3:09:19] <+Amaideus> ^
[3:09:19] <bamith23> If it comes free with Shivering Isles style expansion, sure, do horse armour.
[3:09:23] <%shakespearo> I just want horse dressup
[3:09:24] <%TheHateFish> B R O L E G
[3:09:28] <+Amaideus> It was always a price to content ratio
[3:09:31] <stuffamiriteyea> exactly 20
[3:09:34] <athuramn> why peepo pissed at horse armor, that seems rad as a concept
[3:09:34] <+HairyWario> how much would you pay for horse armor in Elden Ring
[3:09:35] <MrMoonGoose> 21 should be enough
[3:09:35] <%okuriskyles> it's not the same as petting but you can feed torrent trail mix and it looks real cute
[3:09:39] <+Amaideus> Like a dollar
[3:09:40] <+abrupt_abe> Fully upgraded Oleg can solo bosses LUL
[3:09:42] <ashenjuan25> Fucking hell
[3:09:50] <+Jiggisnipe> wasn't horse armor $5?
[3:09:50] <+Amaideus> Maybe 2 if it's something really cool
[3:09:53] <@Solidus_113> I ended the game at lvl 146
[3:10:02] <+HairyWario> I'd pay 3.99 at most
[3:10:02] <%TheHateFish> @MrMoonGoose 20 gives exactly 100 FP, which is how much Oleg costs
[3:10:04] <DigiDom> im almost finished and only have  22
[3:10:07] <@DashXero> @athuramn It was the cookie that made way for a request for milk.
[3:10:09] <+eanscrale> You don't want to be Chipp Zanuff in a game full of Potemkins.
[3:10:11] <MyNameIsRasus> i just left the 4th area and i'm at level 110
[3:10:12] <SomeAsianDood> you fold like a house of cards if you don't up vigor for mid late game areas
[3:10:15] <bamith23> @Jiggisnipe $5 the year Oblivion came out is like $20 now, which is accurate to a lot of cosmetic DLCs these days.
[3:10:19] <w_khan> He should Mihn it and lvl 99 before doing the boss
[3:10:22] <%townzzzzz> the woolie hole
[3:10:22] <MyNameIsRasus> try finger
[3:10:27] <ashenjuan25> I just stumbled on a teleporter that took me to some late game sky temple shit and this game is legit giving me anxiety with the scope of the fucking map
[3:10:28] <velgaduere> I love how the phrasing has to work with these messages LUL
[3:10:31] <DelgotHansto> I 20 Vig every souls game and it was unviable for this one, way too many one shots, ended at like 40
[3:10:34] <@Solidus_113> do you?
[3:10:35] <%okuriskyles> @Jiggisnipe is inflation really that bad
[3:10:36] <MrMoonGoose> NOPE!
[3:10:38] <athuramn> @dashxero LUL
[3:10:39] <+Amaideus> @ashenjuan25 Bro I feel you

[3:10:49] <+Amaideus> @Jiggisnipe Relative to how much the games cost
[3:10:51] <+Javaa01> Fast travel status: disabled
[3:10:55] <+Amaideus> Back then games were like 40 bucks
[3:10:55] <w_khan> You can tp from inside caves?
[3:10:57] <Frazbeee> this one sucks HAIRY BALLS
[3:10:59] <+Jiggisnipe> @bamith23 I get what your saying but inflation doesn't work like that in 16 years
[3:11:00] <+Vigonept> are those gears
[3:11:02] <Aussie_Manny> that's a good message
[3:11:05] <%MajorCrasher> I'm at like 15 big currently at lvl 50 something
[3:11:06] <MrMoonGoose> @w_khan Not this one ;)
[3:11:08] <+Amaideus> So 5 then is 1/8th
[3:11:09] <%okuriskyles> that's definitely not true, oblivion was $60 on launch
[3:11:25] <+Amaideus> I thought the price jump happened after oblivion?
[3:11:25] <%MajorCrasher> 15 vig*
[3:11:26] <Aussie_Manny> you people and your goddamn finger messages
[3:11:28] <MrMoonGoose> SO GOOD
[3:11:30] <+Jiggisnipe> also oblivion was a 360 ps3 game LUL
[3:11:32] <bamith23> @Jiggisnipe Then why is Bethesda constantly charging $20 for some simple colour cosmetics in Fallout 76? They ain't the only ones doing that price point either.

[3:11:45] <athuramn> finger but hole ?
[3:11:45] <+vaderxyz1970> @Aussie_Manny The game has Finger Maidens so its fair game

[3:11:46] <+onanimasu> doge
[3:11:46] <ashenjuan25> Where did he get the summon he wants to buff mind for again? I might wanna pick that up
[3:11:53] <emptyantics> Borked his last bork

[3:13:21] <Dopamien> are there sigma wolves?

[3:13:30] <bamith23> @Dopamien *Sweat*
[3:13:33] <+Amaideus> I hate this game so much, I can't tell if I've done this one or not
[3:13:37] <MyNameIsRasus> reminder that "alpha wolves" are just mother wolves
[3:13:40] <Aussie_Manny> Good message
[3:13:47] <wqorst> drop distance in this game goes from no damage to death in the span of like 3 feet
[3:13:52] <athuramn> @amaideus that's me with the whole game
[3:13:56] <%Prevot> I don't remember going through this place...
[3:13:57] <Frazbeee> and daddy eolves
[3:14:12] <+Amaideus> I'm pretty sure I haven't, I don't remember that hallway he just left

[3:14:20] <haitakaa> woolie hates dogs Kappa
[3:14:21] <rReizs> drops in ER are basically "will it kill"

[3:14:27] <@Irridium> @ashenjuan25 yep lol
[3:14:27] <DerpioParty> All this pup snuffing
[3:14:34] <+Vigonept> alpha omega shit is COMPLETE bs
[3:14:51] <+theoldone001> Most "Alpha" redpill bullshit is just idiots mistaking angry animal moms telling you to stay the fuck away
[3:14:56] <%shakespearo> @ashenjuan25 it's based on a single study on wolves in captivity that the author has spent his entire career trying to undo from public conciousness because it was flawed and gets completely misunderstoof
[3:14:57] <MyNameIsRasus> @ashenjuan25 sure is. the researcher that proposed the theory later debunked it himself
[3:14:59] <Frazbeee> blaidd is a sigma wolf
[3:15:04] <@Solidus_113> damn
[3:15:05] <athuramn> real ones know tarikDance tarikDance
[3:15:08] <+Brazuka91> are the poochies making the bonfires they are sleeping by?
[3:15:10] <user_naim> @vigonept except in the lands between, where enemies get damage bonuses
[3:15:15] <emptyantics> Blaidd is a simp but a Sigma as well
[3:15:16] <Dopamien> @Frazbeee lmao true
[3:15:21] <DerpioParty> Those rag doll dog feet are kinda creepy
[3:15:31] <+Vigonept> sigma tarnished takes more hits than alpha tarnished
[3:15:31] <ashenjuan25> Nah Blaidd is just a simp
[3:15:31] <%Gruhunchously> @ashenjuan25 That's hilarious
[3:15:46] <olaksi> @ashenjuan25 yeah total bs, so ofc internet weirdos think it applies to humans too
[3:15:49] <%Prevot> definitely never came here
[3:15:50] <wqorst> where the fuck is this cave I totally missed this
[3:15:51] <+theoldone001> ohhh this place, I 'member now
[3:15:54] <%holydeviant1> woah what I missed this entirely
[3:15:54] <QueequegTheater> So apparently ER runs flawlessy...on the Steam Deck :/
[3:16:00] <Aussie_Manny> i hope the left path goes to an even BIGGER area LUL
[3:16:04] <ashenjuan25> That one fight you can summon Blaidd in he does like no damage
[3:16:07] <user_naim> wait what the fuck i missed this whole place
[3:16:10] <athuramn> the first time I saw blaidd I'm thinking "that shit in the loading screens isn't concept art?"
[3:16:13] <%illicitdonut> Wait, where is this?!? I've been playing for almost 40 hours and I haven't seen this place.
[3:16:14] <user_naim> god damn it
[3:16:15] <ashenjuan25> Tho tbf that could be because that fight is bull shit
[3:16:30] <athuramn> @queequegtheater fr?
[3:16:34] <+theoldone001> Blaidd and Ranni's questline is so easy to miss
[3:16:37] <Pappajimbo> wolves are weak to fire arisen

[3:16:47] <athuramn> <3
[3:16:56] <bamith23> I have no idea where Blaidd ends up yet, I assume he's just somewhere I can't reach yet.
[3:17:10] <rReizs> the fire grease cookbook was like number 1 but i didnt find it for a long ass time
[3:17:14] <QueequegTheater> Could be fake though
[3:17:27] <Aussie_Manny> nah
[3:17:28] <velgaduere> might as well, there's no weapon durability
[3:17:30] <+theoldone001> @bamith23 What was the last thing you did? He goes multiple places, one being at Caelid
[3:17:39] <@Solidus_113> no spoilers
[3:17:44] <@Solidus_113> take it to PMs
[3:17:45] <ashenjuan25> So wait I‚Äôm confused how do you stack two different effects on one weapon again?
[3:17:51] <athuramn> it was gabes plan all along, he just wanted to play elden ring on the go @queequegtheater

[3:18:14] <%shakespearo> @w_khan missed time-stop right behind that wall
[3:18:19] <%Tearonex> goddammit I totally forgot to come back to this cave on my playthrough LUL
[3:18:19] <kadjah> Do you have to kill the wolves? is there a befriend mechanic in this dark souls game?
[3:18:22] <rReizs> you can give an art of war to a bleed weapon and by doing so also give it poison for example
[3:18:26] <%okuriskyles> guys you missed witch time
[3:18:51] <bamith23> Oh yeah, this cave is where I got lucky and got a land octopus helmet.
[3:18:51] <ashenjuan25> You know what‚Äôs next level trolling with the messages besides the baiting for fake fog walls? Putting a message near an npc summon sign or a ladder
[3:18:54] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[3:18:56] <athuramn> anyone else think he was gonna swing himself off the ledge there
[3:18:58] <ashenjuan25> Those people can go to hell

[3:19:17] <+theoldone001> I found my first illusory floor last night and lost my mind
[3:19:18] <%okuriskyles> @ashenjuan25 man there's a fight later on that makes messages REALLY annoying
[3:19:23] <+vaderxyz1970> I want a mod where they replace daggers with 1 dmg foam noodles
[3:19:24] <w_khan> Found the Wayne basement
[3:19:25] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie, what do your elf eyes see?
[3:19:29] <%holydeviant1> good for status arrows
[3:19:31] <+Amaideus> @ashenjuan25 I almost died to a message that said "message, then death" at the bottom of a ladder
[3:19:37] <emptyantics> Bat‚Ä¶cave
[3:19:46] <ashenjuan25> @okuriskyles I think I know the one
[3:19:47] <rReizs> people who put messages at the base of ladders are scum
[3:19:49] <+darkfoxxs> Where is this cave?
[3:19:50] <+Amaideus> I was as pissed as I was entertained
[3:19:56] <ashenjuan25> Honestly idk if I like that fight
[3:20:01] <QueequegTheater> They heard you were comin
[3:20:02] <%oda_flobunaga> I found my first invisible floor yesterday.  I'm not Okay
[3:20:04] <bamith23> Would figure the ladder would take priority over the message prompt
[3:20:07] <ashenjuan25> Has probably one of the funniest visual gags tho
[3:20:14] <%holydeviant1> the number of times messages have made me miss a swap to my shield
[3:20:17] <Aussie_Manny> give it a go
[3:20:24] <ImSincerelySorry> This game has some bull platforming
[3:20:24] <Aussie_Manny> ez

[3:33:37] <%shakespearo> I hope from never stops obfuscating shit like this. I love that this game doesn't tell me everything
[3:33:38] <Dopamien> are there any enemies good for testing damage?
[3:33:40] <%TheHateFish> For you, it's basically nothing. +15% at or below 5 load, +10% at or below 15, basically nothing over 15.
[3:33:40] <Aussie_Manny> Good cave, try fun
[3:33:42] <+Dakuu75> "highroad cave" ok
[3:33:49] <%parazoa42> I love the idea that the Elden Ring would be a regular ring just sitting in a chest somewhere.
[3:33:50] <stuffamiriteyea> love short tight caves
[3:33:54] <MyNameIsRasus> mini caves to train new level designers

[3:34:28] <bamith23> There's a couple of spots in the game that has large groups of enemies that can be fun to test stuff out. Haven't found a spot that has a group of 10+ enemies within 5-10 second walking distance though.

[3:46:14] <zenith0111> If you have phobia of insects this game is going to get you hard
[3:46:14] <+Amaideus> I know that staff
[3:46:15] <stuffamiriteyea> smithing stone [5] should tell you the expected level of this zone
[3:46:18] <+Exicuren> I got trapped here as a lv 1 Wretch, it was pain to escape
[3:46:20] <@Solidus_113> crafting mat
[3:46:26] <bamith23> They're reasonable when you can quickly take them down... They get more poise when skittering that makes them real jank though.
[3:46:27] <Blank9> big upgrades
[3:46:30] <+Order_of_Mystery> @reveresao üëç
[3:46:33] <%Archmortal> it came from the wall, not the corpse

[3:47:13] <%shakespearo> @KBGuilty sure did
[3:47:13] <James_Quivers> It's an humaniember
[3:47:20] <artoflec> this area really reminds me of the poison nioh 1 mines LUL
[3:47:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @oda_flobunaga stop you're giving me flashbacks LUL
[3:47:41] <+mechslayer71> clear the area LUL
[3:47:49] <zenith0111> People getting clapped in chat
[3:47:56] <+eanscrale> You can get a ton if you invade, but good luck in a 1 vs 3
[3:47:56] <%shakespearo> this is your new home, woolie, you live here now
[3:48:00] <+mechslayer71> not worth it to use
[3:48:04] <%Archmortal> fun fact, Rune Arcs are almost never worth it
[3:48:07] <+darkfoxxs> Didn‚Äôt even know there was kids here lmao
[3:48:08] <+theoldone001> This is like Humanity
[3:48:09] <+Dakuu75> Oh, I didn't know it did anything without the rune
[3:48:13] <%shakespearo> I'm sitting on 50 of these from multiplayer
[3:48:14] <tubit> Banished to the crystal mines
[3:48:15] <%oda_flobunaga> @Th3SmartAlec I mean it won't be too bad if he comes back in like 100 levels but still, right now...
[3:48:18] <+Amaideus> They're trash without a rune
[3:48:18] <sendart> rune arcs are great
[3:48:25] <+theoldone001> Great Rune effects are only activated when a Rune Arc is used
[3:48:27] <+twohitgood> save using it until after you have the great rune. it's an ember but not quite the drop rate of an ember.
[3:48:30] <haitakaa> you can always get more by doing multiplayer
[3:48:33] <perfect_disaster> katanas are no good here
[3:48:34] <emptyantics> You need a rune first for them to be worth it
[3:48:40] <+theoldone001> But you have to unlock the effects of a Great Rune first
[3:48:45] <haitakaa> they're like sunlight medals
[3:48:48] <w_khan> those guys were just there mining their business...
[3:49:06] <Riyokuno> if you wanna know, rats can actually drop those rune arcs
[3:49:08] <+Dakuu75> @w_khan fucking, booooooo! lol
[3:49:08] <kes009900> what a mf gotta do to get some crack in this place?
[3:49:08] <+theoldone001> Your favorite enemies the rats drop them too, like humanity lol
[3:49:09] <@DashXero> Chat, please. If Woolie wants your help, he'll ask for it. And he likely won't.
[3:49:18] <+AyupaPupa> their mining magic even makes drilling noises lmao
[3:49:23] <VJdarkworld> !backseat
[3:49:25] <Blank9> good amount of runes early on
[3:49:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> hi ho, hi ho
[3:49:26] <iacus_> oh woolie going deeper huh
[3:49:33] <bamith23> Eh, my comment was mainly for sarcasm.

[4:06:29] <%Cherokia666> @mrtanaka111 Check out the other Souls games playthrough.  He's been going through the series
[4:06:41] <+DrFacilier> Alright now that they're gone lets start arguing over spoilers again Kappa
[4:07:04] <%Solarint> Solarint subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Watching the Black Mesa playthrough again. It was so interesting seeing someone who is so experienced with video games play through the story of Half-life for the first time. Really unique perspective that I appreciate. Lots of stuff I took for granted in the story because half-life 1 was one of the first games I remember playing as a kid. Keep up the great work ya'll.
[4:07:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:07:08] <+Nicholas0123> spoilers, I beat the game
[4:07:27] <zenith0111> I think [Redacted] was too harsh on [Redacted] and shoulve [Redacted] instead
[4:07:42] <stevenellis386> coxNod
[4:08:02] <%Double_Tap_That> Was Cerebrawl ever officially canceled?
[4:08:13] <@DashXero> Not that I'm aware of.
[4:08:13] <T_Sasquatch> Do you hear that brasssss
[4:08:24] <ThatsCriCri> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[4:08:28] <kazadaz> i COMPLETELY missed the jumping part of this dungeon til just now, need to go back now
[4:08:32] <DSD24> Cerebrawl was that game with the buff witch right?
[4:08:38] <zhenthrim213> COMP COMP COMP
[4:08:41] <stevenellis386> nope.Dev is still making it as we speak. @Double_Tap_That
[4:08:42] <%Double_Tap_That> @DSD24 Yes
[4:08:56] <AnimuStewshine> still in active development, they make posts on Twitter from time to time
[4:09:06] <bamith23> I should just get back to my own game, I can just watch all these streams i'm missing during the summer while playing Monster Hunter or something lol
[4:09:09] <%Solarint> god I hate all the tracking overheads in ER. its like DS2 level
[4:09:10] <MrMoonGoose> That wasn't a real spoiler mods, but I salute you XD
[4:09:14] <DSD24> @Double_Tap_That Thank you for clarifying!
[4:09:23] <+mechslayer71> woolies gonna have a fit when he hits the end of the dungeon
[4:09:27] <+TopTieramisu> i wonder where fromsoft goes after elden ring
[4:09:35] <+theoldone001> @Solarint Yeah they're pretty bad this time around
[4:09:43] <%shakespearo> turbo poop
[4:09:44] <+Amaideus> Oh yeah, because tracking overheads hasn't been a problem in BB or DS3
[4:09:47] <+TopTieramisu> will they work on their other neglected franchises now until the next big miyazaki project?
[4:09:47] <MurseJOCO> Hope y‚Äôall doin well! Anyone else gonna play FF Stranger of Paradise??
[4:09:48] <bamith23> @TopTieramisu Technically wherever the hell they want, they could go back to King's Field now if they want.
[4:09:49] <+Amaideus> Or Sekiro
[4:09:53] <stevenellis386> @cerebrawlin is streaming right now
[4:10:07] <DSD24> I hate this place I wanna go home
[4:10:12] <stuffamiriteyea> check the spell too
[4:10:22] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu i think that's the smart path. work on their other franchises while also working on the next big thing. fromsoft + time can create absolute gold
[4:10:23] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i hate them prawns
[4:10:27] <DSD24> Being here as a level 1 Wretch was terrible
[4:10:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're here forever :)
[4:10:44] <DSD24> Repuken?
[4:10:47] <%Solarint> @Amaideus I never played BB because I don't have a ps4, but I don't remember it being so annoying in ds3, but its been a while and I've only played ds3 once
[4:10:50] <emptyantics> @mursejoco Playing it rn, it‚Äôs great but the story is terrible
[4:10:50] <ashenjuan25> Woolie and Reggie just got done recreating that scene from it‚Äôs always sunny where Dennis and Mac take a shit on Charlie and Frank
[4:10:55] <+theoldone001> These dudes use Crystal Geomancy lol
[4:10:56] <DSD24> Or a Raging Storm?
[4:10:57] <zenith0111> Not a ground wave
[4:10:58] <BlackermanZX> RAGINGG STOOOORMM
[4:11:07] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I see Woolie found the ‚Äúmimic‚Äù chest
[4:11:07] <%X2Eliah> how much int?
[4:11:12] <DSD24> 24
[4:11:12] <emptyantics> Raging Storm!
[4:11:19] <%X2Eliah> ok thats far away
[4:11:20] <+Reverend_Roscoe> reverse flash kick
[4:11:30] <MrMoonGoose> @Jessie_Lockhart Purposefully
[4:11:36] <CatsDrunkonCopper> get your runes
[4:11:36] <bamith23> Only reason Elden Ring exists is because of all the other games Fromsoft has made anyways, its their best interest to keep that trend going, they can make a game like Elden Ring every 5-6 years using whatever assets they make from other games along the way.
[4:11:39] <DigiDom> nope it
[4:11:42] <+Amaideus> @Solarint It depends on the attack in question, there are some you can't strafe and there are others where strafing is 100% safe
[4:11:46] <moonbearbacon> they're gone
[4:11:58] <DigiDom> just run past
[4:12:08] <zenith0111> Poor Bug Eyesight
[4:12:15] <MrMoonGoose> Freebe
[4:12:32] <%shakespearo> enemies are hella blind in this, until they spot you, at which point they chase you far as fuck
[4:12:33] <tubit> ruuun
[4:12:34] <+Reverend_Roscoe> be wary of left
[4:12:36] <%townzzzzz> disregard tarnished get rocks
[4:12:39] <bamith23> Woolie once again proves his TV might be too big.
[4:12:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> the next 100 hours of the game actually takes place entirely in this one cave

[4:29:26] <bamith23> Yeah after killing the first major boss the guy tells you about other dudes, tells you where the academy is, which is where I went first for magic. I assume Woolie will have a similar route I did.
[4:29:27] <+theoldone001> I kind of hate that Holy doesn't one shot skeletons, they get back up regardless

[4:30:30] <bamith23> He should go back down to the Weeping Peninsula before going too far though, I went back way later thinking the area was bigger and decimated the area far too well lol

[4:32:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah that homing drop can be fucky
[4:32:15] <+Jessie_Lockhart> One shot stomp
[4:32:16] <bamith23> The dragon does have feathers though, so dragons are birds.
[4:32:17] <iacus_> the games way of telling you nope
[4:32:18] <@Solidus_113> I use the horse invlun to dodge those
[4:32:19] <kazadaz> No mistakes allowed
[4:32:20] <%funya_rinpa> the dismount iframes are great for that
[4:32:22] <%shakespearo> @emptyantics I don't see it texting teenagers, so I don't think it's Drake
[4:32:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> this isn't Dark Souls, different rules for dragons
[4:32:25] <Crimson_Aether> IT'S A MEE!!!
[4:32:29] <0078thunder> fromsoft has the same dragon model ready to go and theyl be damned if they dont use it
[4:32:29] <%illicitdonut> Guess that's a good time for people who are scalies and into feet?
[4:32:36] <emptyantics> @shakespearo LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:32:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Solidus_113 shit, that's smart
[4:32:44] <bamith23> @Solidus_113 I found its actually better to run towards them if you have the space for it.
[4:33:12] <+theoldone001> @illicitdonut Oh trust me Scalies eat good later on
[4:33:15] <ppangboi> I respect this game's sense of humor for putting both an evil teleporting chest and a big dog in the very starting area
[4:33:18] <kazadaz> Woof
[4:33:19] <+TopTieramisu> dragon fights are dope in this game
[4:33:22] <+Grayhammatter> pups are snufffed
[4:33:26] <%BestTeaMaker> borks busted
[4:33:27] <RyuuAoi> Hell yeah, Woolie! Bob and weave!
[4:33:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> good times watching Pat kill this thing with an exacto knife LUL
[4:33:40] <bamith23> The most fucked up thing on that pounce the dragon does is the chest has a hitbox, which is bullshit lol
[4:33:42] <+Stormiercashew> get out of me swamp!
[4:33:47] <+OrangeMDT> Maybe Agheel is easier on ps4?? I just attacked the legs and rode away whenever it flew
[4:33:49] <%shakespearo> these dragon fights are really good
[4:33:51] <emptyantics> This game has some of the best Dragon fights next to Dragon‚Äôs Dogma
[4:33:55] <iacus_> I killed agheel very easily once I got some more powerful sorceries
[4:33:58] <+TopTieramisu> round 2
[4:34:03] <@Solidus_113> deaggro'd LUL

[4:36:28] <%holydeviant1> @Lion_kun Absolutely
[4:36:28] <tubit> good fight
[4:36:28] <+pectusumbra> use your magic?
[4:36:29] <VJdarkworld> tail SMACK
[4:36:30] <%BestTeaMaker> @Lion_kun yes, but you have to keep attacking
[4:36:31] <fat_burtreynolds> Danger Butt
[4:36:34] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Strong sweep
[4:36:35] <%BestTeaMaker> or else blood buildup drops
[4:36:37] <+theoldone001> Close, it's doable tho. You jumped right on the thicc part of its tail
[4:36:45] <%holydeviant1> You... do have a grease for it
[4:36:47] <%hax_metatron> GREASE UP
[4:36:51] <geekpatientzero> @emptyantics No they don't you manchild fnanboy
[4:36:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> just hit him more and also get hit less :)
[4:36:57] <geekpatientzero> *fanboy
[4:37:02] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Skellebros
[4:37:05] <user_naim> Not a big deal, we can just learn it
[4:37:12] <emptyantics> @geekpatientzero Someone‚Äôs triggered Kappa
[4:37:14] <kazadaz> Game-warriors are the new console-warriors
[4:37:17] <+JT_Jag> this thing does way too much AOE, the skeletons are gonna get pulped
[4:37:27] <+Fetrigon> mind goblins
[4:37:29] <bamith23> Eh, use them twice and then you're out and won't have to worry about it anymore
[4:37:38] <@Menitta> @emptyantics @geekpatientzero stop
[4:37:41] <bamith23> Burn all your shit
[4:37:44] <%X2Eliah> they slow
[4:37:46] <Dopamien> doing their best lmao
[4:37:47] <%sherlockkat> I don't think youj can apply grease to the weapon you are currently using.
[4:37:52] <VJdarkworld> skellies have no horsies Sadge
[4:37:55] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Dont give up skeletons
[4:37:56] <%Reveresao> Did woolie remember to do the two hand horse cheat?
[4:37:56] <primarch_lupercal> poor skelly boys
[4:37:57] <+pectusumbra> could try your new dog
[4:38:00] <Aussie_Manny> Skeleton Warriors!
[4:38:06] <bamith23> @sherlockkat He could use fire grease somehow, so might work
[4:38:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> we livin
[4:38:11] <%Xelhesia> TATAKAE
[4:38:15] <+theoldone001> Man that ONE point in Vit has been saving you
[4:38:19] <Frazbeee> flamedrake talisman
[4:38:26] <+kraajkase> oh they dead
[4:38:31] <@Menitta> Jeez whenever that knockdown noise happens to you I get so scared
[4:38:33] <ppangboi> I am very dumb and beat this guy without the horse
[4:38:35] <crimsonharvest> yeah if you can bring a large or strike weapon down on that snoot its naptime
[4:38:35] <NBUsagi> Yooo see if you can break its wings
[4:38:42] <KingDrPimp> Thats how I feel about most consumables generally, either it'll get wasted or I don't need it
[4:38:46] <%sherlockkat> @sherlockkat No I meant, you can't apply buffs to special weapons. This is the one he got from beating darawil, right?
[4:38:51] <emptyantics> You got this WOOLIE
[4:38:56] <+TopTieramisu> to a crisp
[4:38:57] <agustorm123> Dame dane dameyooow
[4:38:59] <%RyTYoung> Unlucky
[4:39:04] <bamith23> Nah, ain't monster hunter. Be interesting if you could, but don't usually happen.
[4:39:04] <%Xelhesia> u can do it woolz
[4:39:04] <Aussie_Manny> Fire indeed hot. doodBait
[4:39:06] <+Jessie_Lockhart> This gonna be tough. But very doable.
[4:39:09] <+keiji_maede> COOKED!!
[4:39:09] <+pectusumbra> @sherlockkat you can buff special weapons in this
[4:39:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> that one is really tricky to dodge
[4:39:12] <+theoldone001> The being knocked down of Torrent sound is scary shit, its a literal death sentence everytime it happens
[4:39:12] <Jontman42> I find those easier not locked on
[4:39:26] <+Reverend_Roscoe> DUCKIN HIM
[4:39:31] <fat_burtreynolds> Airfried
[4:39:35] <Frazbeee> @sherlockkat you cant apply to boss weapons, but can on soecial
[4:39:37] <%akajaybay> curious to see the new spirit, never found that
[4:39:37] <%hax_metatron> On foot is good too honestly. Don‚Äôt forget laming it out and Dark Souls it
[4:39:41] <+Jiggisnipe> @sherlockkat think he applied it during the tree spirit boss
[4:39:41] <+Fetrigon> bro those things are dead LUL
[4:39:42] <+JT_Jag> I do find it funny that the group of NPCs the dragon flew in and roasted seem to have despawned forever
[4:39:49] <%sherlockkat> gotcha
[4:39:49] <%akajaybay> but theyll likely all get cooked
[4:39:49] <agustorm123> Pat bugged this dragon
[4:39:51] <bamith23> If you burn all your consumables you won't have to worry about whether or not you should use them :)
[4:39:55] <emptyantics> Nothing‚Äôs quite as sick as jumping over the fire and running towards him to heavy slash him
[4:39:56] <@Solidus_113> you can get a lot of stomps from just being off the horse
[4:39:57] <+volitzern> He has already buffed this one, so no argument to be made l ol
[4:40:10] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:40:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Imagine not having Torrent for this
[4:40:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> how's the horse-fu
[4:40:28] <iacus_> head = lots of posture dmg
[4:40:41] <%RyTYoung> @jessie_lockhart there‚Äôs another boss later on that made me think the exact same thing
[4:40:42] <iacus_> wow
[4:40:44] <iacus_> magic pixl
[4:40:45] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Thanks wall
[4:40:49] <Dopamien> its true, if I get hit in the face I lose my balance too

[4:40:59] <@Irridium> back to his spawn LUL
[4:40:59] <fat_burtreynolds> Somehow not cooked
[4:41:00] <Neo_Kyon> too far
[4:41:00] <Aussie_Manny> You went too far.
[4:41:00] <penitentpendant> Leashed
[4:41:01] <KingDrPimp> I knew that was gonna happen ;-;
[4:41:02] <%VladVandal> thats hapoened to me before
[4:41:02] <kazadaz> Oh, FROM
[4:41:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL less epic
[4:41:03] <OblivionSword1> that can happen ?
[4:41:04] <%funya_rinpa> lol
[4:41:04] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Oh shit
[4:41:08] <%TheHateFish> He keeps the HP he was on
[4:41:09] <%Lion_kun> health stays down
[4:41:09] <scarletgameshow> yeah it happens
[4:41:10] <user_naim> peace out
[4:41:10] <@Irridium> I think his health still stays
[4:41:11] <Frazbeee> yeah hapoens
[4:41:11] <@Solidus_113> happens a lot with dragons
[4:41:12] <Evendrag> VIDEOGAMES
[4:41:12] <+JT_Jag> hasn't regained health at least
[4:41:13] <+mechslayer71> yup, it ain't that open. health still down tho
[4:41:13] <Blank9> health is fine
[4:41:13] <crimsonharvest> at least he keeps his hp
[4:41:13] <+0neReeler> RING OUT
[4:41:15] <emptyantics> Out of zone LUL
[4:41:15] <tubit> never seen that before
[4:41:16] <BlackermanZX> woolz the QA god
[4:41:17] <artoflec> the Miyazaki touch tm elaKek
[4:41:18] <invader_rin> It happen to me a lot with them
[4:41:21] <+Jiggisnipe> oh but hp stays so that's cool
[4:41:21] <+orochiblood> not like your summons were doing anything to be fair
[4:41:22] <%Cherokia666> This fight is very jank
[4:41:22] <penitentpendant> @OblivionSword1 Dragon's have a bad habit of leashing in this game
[4:41:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the edges of the fight zone for Agheel are kinda weird tbh
[4:41:24] <T_Sasquatch> He kept hp tho
[4:41:25] <Aussie_Manny> At least his health's still down.
[4:41:26] <VJdarkworld> actually helped for some free hits LUL
[4:41:28] <%VladVandal> that happened to me later and i have yet to re-find that dragon
[4:41:30] <@Menitta> oh god that'd be the worst if you had to restart the fight
[4:41:32] <+volitzern> I've killed like 6 and never had that happen üòÇ
[4:41:36] <artoflec> there's some cool spectacle here but the dragon fights are super lame really lol
[4:41:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> now that's a stomp
[4:41:46] <iacus_> perfect spot to snipe w sorc, over here
[4:41:50] <DelgotHansto> not really QA moment if it's working as intended LUL
[4:41:51] <+theoldone001> They could have just made him fly back to his spawn, instead of teleporting. It's really jarring and immersion breaking when they do that.
[4:42:05] <+mechslayer71> @artoflec the basic ones are, there's a couple late in that are cool
[4:42:15] <+orochiblood> people really overreacting over a teleport
[4:42:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:42:18] <VJdarkworld> bleeed
[4:42:19] <tubit> he's doing it
[4:42:19] <agustorm123> Is super easy with sorcery
[4:42:20] <@Menitta> OH WOW

[4:43:06] <BlackermanZX> i thought it said dragon communism for a sec
[4:43:08] <%AngryAsian5> It's got a few kinks to work out. But this fight is super fun. LUL
[4:43:08] <+Proxzo> Sean Connery
[4:43:11] <+mechslayer71> @0078thunder there's 2 in particular I'm thinking of
[4:43:14] <+TopTieramisu> miyazaki doesn't f around
[4:43:14] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Ubi Seething LUL
[4:43:15] <+volitzern> To the shriiiiine! xD
[4:43:17] <emptyantics> 10/10 fight
[4:43:19] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Dats a boss fight right dere
[4:43:24] <emptyantics> UBI SEETHING LUL
[4:43:31] <scarletgameshow> Did they beat any major boss yet?
[4:43:34] <Jewoodsforreal> Congrats!
[4:43:38] <+mechslayer71> @scarletgameshow nope
[4:43:40] <+theoldone001> It's funny how dragons are just some side bosses but they're really fun and interesting.
[4:43:46] <%Xelhesia> pat broke this boss like 10 times LUL
[4:43:50] <%jonblnt> Is this woolie‚Äôs first great enemy felled?
[4:43:56] <%akajaybay> well bleed worked
[4:43:58] <scarletgameshow> they are kinda behind, I was afraid I lost morst of it at this point
[4:44:10] <bamith23> Well actually Reggie ignore that
[4:44:22] <Dopamien> boss arena is like 1/3 of the lake, not bad but would be cool if it was the whole lake
[4:44:28] <+volitzern> I think 5 is 3200
[4:44:34] <bamith23> No delete the other message if any dang it lol
[4:44:54] <+0neReeler> think you can also see rune amounts by selling to merchant?
[4:45:01] <Aussie_Manny> It's still beating? monkaS
[4:45:01] <%insomniacCoder> @bamith23 there is a black knight that comes out at night in places
[4:45:02] <+volitzern> You can
[4:45:02] <scarletgameshow> @Dopamien I think is a technical limitation, the boss arena is not tailored to a single boss fight, is likely a fixed area for all bosses
[4:45:09] <@Solidus_113> still do it
[4:45:15] <bamith23> @insomniacCoder yeah, i've somehow lucked out in finding those.
[4:45:19] <linSP> Mmm persimmon
[4:45:21] <emptyantics> Eat the heart
[4:45:29] <Frazbeee> sorcery sucks go faith
[4:45:38] <Aussie_Manny> God, those load times are phenomenal. woolieEVIL
[4:45:39] <scarletgameshow> yeah faith is amazing
[4:45:40] <+theoldone001> I went Int some Arcane cause some dragon spells are actually pretty good
[4:45:42] <%X2Eliah> yeah unfortunately all are faith
[4:45:43] <+volitzern> Can always use em for ng+ or reroll lol
[4:45:45] <%hax_metatron> Nah wait until Woolie gets to the cool spells
[4:45:50] <SilverFaustX> nooo
[4:45:58] <+0neReeler> fai/arc builds
[4:46:02] <DelgotHansto> Doesn't matter how good it is, only how cool it is
[4:46:03] <scarletgameshow> sorcery is cool, but not as cool as faith
[4:46:05] <bamith23> My next playthrough will probably be int/faith/arcane build.
[4:46:05] <@Solidus_113> there are plenty of dragon hearts to get everything, relax chat
[4:46:07] <SilverFaustX> dont buy these
[4:46:09] <+Order_of_Mystery> it is!
[4:46:10] <Aussie_Manny> If you want to be a dragon build
[4:46:15] <Dopamien> @scarletgameshow Yea I dont blame devs because programming it sounds like a nightmare. some boss arenas feel nice if the design is fit for it
[4:46:17] <%X2Eliah> @bamith23 skip the int
[4:46:18] <Blank9> I like claw, it looks cool
[4:46:19] <%BestTeaMaker> claw is great
[4:46:22] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Become as durgan
[4:46:25] <%BestTeaMaker> it's a fantastic melee move
[4:46:26] <stinkbuggy01> you dont need many att points tho
[4:46:28] <bamith23> @bamith23 Int is to see any hexes I might find
[4:46:31] <emptyantics> Claw is giod
[4:46:36] <%X2Eliah> maybe
[4:46:40] <%BestTeaMaker> YES
[4:46:40] <+0neReeler> too bad they didn't know, beast build
[4:46:42] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[4:46:42] <scarletgameshow> yeah but there are plenty of hearts
[4:46:46] <yomario876> yes but later
[4:46:47] <OblivionSword1> are there any int dragon things ?
[4:46:51] <crimsonharvest> more things to do than get powers? not that i've seen
[4:46:57] <%BestTeaMaker> @OblivionSword1 not to my knowledge, it's largely faith/arcane
[4:46:59] <+volitzern> You get several more, and they're all Faith/Arcane
[4:47:06] <+theoldone001> There is plenty to do with the hearts. there are way more spells
[4:47:08] <+vaderxyz1970> @OblivionSword1 Glintstone breath I think?
[4:47:12] <scarletgameshow> there is one dragon that alone gives 5 hearts
[4:47:18] <bamith23> One thing is you can get magic damage from it despite faith.
[4:47:21] <%BestTeaMaker> @OblivionSword1 that's still faith/arcane
[4:47:30] <Malikwest11> There is other spells but they use the same stats
[4:47:32] <+StryderStrikesAt> I‚Äôve seen at least 10 dragons in game
[4:47:37] <abyssalgrief> Dorgon Incants are all int faith without exception afaik
[4:47:44] <yomario876> there are couple later no worries
[4:47:46] <+0neReeler> needs phrases to be highlighted
[4:47:55] <zenith0111> BIG IMPORTANT ITEM
[4:48:08] <emptyantics> IMPORTANT ITEM
[4:48:12] <+JT_Jag> So the Rune of Death was used to kill... Godwin was it?
[4:48:23] <bamith23> Did Woolie find the warp pipe to beast buddy?
[4:48:25] <+theoldone001> Godfrey seems to be called the God of Death not because he has domain over death, but because he was the first immortal to die.
[4:48:25] <yomario876> Got to talk to D at roundtable
[4:48:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Probably tastes like Truffles
[4:48:39] <yomario876> D
[4:48:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> humu humu

[4:51:15] <bamith23> Beast stuff is interesting cause of low requirements, so definitely meant to find it early.
[4:51:16] <+volitzern> Key items
[4:51:17] <crimsonharvest> clawmark is a ranged/magic implemnt
[4:51:18] <+pectusumbra> a talisman and a key I believe
[4:51:40] <Dopamien> @Bread_Assassin beast spells scale slightly differently, but you can use both
[4:51:42] <iacus_> the cleric beast
[4:51:47] <kazadaz> Yeah it's just a popup on the screen like when someone ratess your message
[4:51:50] <+OniOniOniiii> the beast eye trembles monkaS

[4:53:01] <+OniOniOniiii> faith gets a LOT
[4:53:02] <huskarl_zap> 6 faith
[4:53:02] <%holydeviant1> As a weird side effect, two-handing THIS SEAL ALONE empowers your incants harder!

[4:53:19] <%BestTeaMaker> Faith is eating good this game
[4:53:19] <+anoldtoilet> i now have more sorcery stuff than i know what to do with
[4:53:20] <%funya_rinpa> Takes a minute for sorcery to get hot if you don't know where to go
[4:53:21] <crimsonharvest> no its like the black eye in DS1
[4:53:21] <kazadaz> No it's just a popup, totally automatic
[4:53:22] <%hax_metatron> JUST WAIT WOOLIE
[4:53:22] <Jontman42> THESE MUSCLES ARE MY FAITH
[4:53:22] <zenith0111> Im running Faith and thats how I feel when I see sorceries
[4:53:23] <%Xelhesia> dont worry woolz u'll get yours soon
[4:53:25] <%hax_metatron> WAIT TILL GRAVITY
[4:53:28] <%Tearonex> the eye is automatic
[4:53:29] <RyuuAoi> Believe in Jesus, Woolie.
[4:53:30] <KingDrPimp> You'll get your time to shine
[4:53:31] <+JT_Jag> The Eyeball is like the cracked red eye in Dark Souls 1, it tells you when you're nearby
[4:53:32] <%TheHateFish> Nah, it'll just throw pop-ups when stuff happens
[4:53:33] <%X2Eliah> naw you just have it on you
[4:53:33] <linSP> Front ended faith
[4:53:33] <@Solidus_113> it'll just work
[4:53:35] <+volitzern> It's like the item for invading in ds1
[4:53:37] <+anoldtoilet> cannon of haima bro
[4:53:37] <scarletgameshow> @Order_of_Mystery really? I do the opposite, get a Faith weapon. go all faith
[4:53:42] <+anoldtoilet> cannon of fuckin haima
[4:53:44] <bamith23> It'll just say which dungeons you enter have it
[4:53:45] <die_hardman> Eyeball is a key item, so no worries @woolieversus
[4:53:49] <jam_chamoy> wait till he gets sling rocks
[4:53:51] <Dopamien> buff jesus will have no shits to give
[4:53:53] <+Zxander93> Fate and int get more stuff than any souls game I think. Can't tell you how many times my quality build was disappointed by reqs
[4:53:53] <Malikwest11> Have he talked with the guy in the round table hold?
[4:53:59] <+GilroyGoldBlood> It's all cheap faith stuff
[4:54:08] <+GilroyGoldBlood> requires very little faith
[4:54:09] <+Order_of_Mystery> also valid, ashes of war let your weapons cast cool incantations!
[4:54:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Need for Seed
[4:54:21] <yukichocomilk> playing quality in this game sounds boring af. gotta be int or faith or both
[4:54:21] <die_hardman> @jam_chamoy eh, I didn‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm building towards the tail spin you get from crucible knight
[4:54:24] <%jonblnt> Golden seed nearby
[4:54:37] <%Gruhunchously> Seed Kills
[4:54:43] <+vaderxyz1970> I got it to 5 seeds needed
[4:54:44] <+theoldone001> @yukichocomilk You get plenty of Respec items so no big deal tbh
[4:54:44] <+volitzern> It goes up to 4 at 10+ lol
[4:54:47] <+shabop> it does gom up, but theres more seeds in the game than you need for max flasks
[4:54:49] <+anoldtoilet> @yukichocomilk quality is strong and theres a ton of good weapon arts so at least youre not really suffering
[4:54:50] <@Solidus_113> I think it's every 2nd or 3rd upgrade it increases by 1
[4:54:51] <scarletgameshow> @yukichocomilk naah you can be anything, and you also gain the ability to full respec later in the game
[4:54:52] <kes009900> hot single seeds nearby?
[4:54:52] <+0neReeler> first play dex/int.. next str/fai..
[4:54:54] <%X2Eliah> @jonblnt dude, why
[4:55:00] <yukichocomilk> @theoldone001 for sure, but still means you're respecing into those fun things
[4:55:15] <%MajorCrasher> I wanted to go both int and faith but it's not really viable imo when there's scorceries that need like 70 int
[4:55:19] <+anoldtoilet> having at least one of int, faith, or arcane, and sometimes two of these or all three is cool if ytoure a caster though
[4:55:25] <Iniudan> @yukichocomilk Quality does fine, plenty of ash of war and don't need a whole lot of int or faith for a basic set of utility spell.
[4:55:26] <+anoldtoilet> there are a lot of cross school spells
[4:55:43] <+pectusumbra> @MajorCrasher But you do get the huge reward of that one crazy sword that needs int and faith specific
[4:55:52] <+OniOniOniiii> go kill the guy outside real quick for extra runes Kappa
[4:55:59] <+0neReeler> pretty nice that they mixed stats vs having to minmax 1
[4:56:00] <%MajorCrasher> true @pectusumbra
[4:56:02] <scarletgameshow> Also you literally don't need any spell at all, you can go full martial and end the game.
[4:56:03] <yukichocomilk> @Iniudan i mean that it's boring, not underpowered
[4:56:08] <@Menitta> just don't die later
[4:56:17] <+theoldone001> I wanted to go full Arcane but I am unsure of how the scaling on it works, if weapons that originally scale with Arcane are better and if scaling even affects weapons that use Ashes to get scaling with it.
[4:56:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:56:18] <bamith23> You'll find plenty of runes
[4:56:18] <RyuuAoi> It's fine. Buy firebombs Kappa
[4:56:28] <scarletgameshow> I woldn't call anything in this game boring
[4:56:28] <+pectusumbra> If I ever get the chance to play this myself I want to try the arch-mage style with faith and int
[4:56:32] <jam_chamoy> been trying out str / int since getting the ruin greatsword
[4:56:32] <+vaderxyz1970> You can go upgrade your sword
[4:56:39] <zenith0111> @theoldone001 Ashes scale off weapon level only
[4:56:50] <Iniudan> @yukichocomilk Like is said plenty of ash of war, plenty of cool stuff for melee build on that side.
[4:57:04] <emptyantics> Once you get 80 int, you‚Äôre set
[4:57:16] <+theoldone001> @zenith0111 Yeah that's what I was feeling was happening, there is a massive damage disparity that was very noticeable.
[4:57:39] <+Order_of_Mystery> I hate that D's spells require int too psaGoblin
[4:57:42] <scarletgameshow> I guess no spoilers allowed by the mods, good to know
[4:57:45] <emptyantics> People be redeeming points only to be deleted LUL
[4:57:59] <Hirumm> woolie is bound to find spells eventually
[4:58:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Is it ok to say North be magic East be faith spells?
[4:58:30] <+theoldone001> Surprised he hasn't Woolie stumbled into Moonveil tbh
[4:58:45] <scarletgameshow> east be magic too, especially gravity stuff
[4:58:45] <+pectusumbra> did woolie look at the new spell he picked up?
[4:58:46] <+0neReeler> grrm said to mix them up
[4:58:56] <crimsonharvest> mace is like hatchet right?
[4:59:00] <T_Sasquatch> I'm surprised he's not just beeling the vergil setup
[4:59:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's all kinds of shit all over the place
[4:59:12] <jam_chamoy> i wish meteorite spell tracked BibleThump

[4:59:22] <+robertoszek> holy crap
[4:59:23] <@Solidus_113> you won't get a new good staff until after stormveil, unless you run through a specific zone
[4:59:28] <jacknerik> Progress DansGame
[4:59:34] <velgaduere> this game was designed for that
[4:59:47] <RyuuAoi> Part 169 when? Ha
[4:59:47] <crimsonharvest> played a whole video games worth of game before i was forced to progress
[4:59:57] <%G_Thunders> It‚Äôs jarring whenever I get a cutscene with how little crit path stuff there is compared to optional stuff
[5:00:01] <Aussie_Manny> THE BABY
[5:00:04] <+volitzern> I did stormveil third you can do whatever lol

[5:00:30] <karawra> yay
[5:00:31] <%akajaybay> i think sometimes he's under a curved ruin in earlyish limgrave also.
[5:00:32] <iacus_> yup

[5:00:36] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:00:37] <scarletgameshow> Stormvail doesn't do much in term of gating content. one could explore half the game without going to stormveil
[5:00:37] <+0neReeler> game said go here so i did...
[5:00:37] <Aussie_Manny> They do. LUL
[5:00:39] <velgaduere> STORM THE GATE
[5:00:40] <T_Sasquatch> You're playing correctly
[5:00:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh shit, MArgit might not die of old age after all LUL
[5:00:43] <+OniOniOniiii> i was like 30 in tbh lol
[5:00:44] <zenith0111> @g_thunders Thats actually the subtle genius about ER i found out. Its all kind of required
[5:00:45] <%VladVandal> man, i walkes through stormgates like 20 hours in

[5:00:57] <+dearghostss> LUL
[5:00:57] <Iniudan> I think it took me like 30-40 hours to walk through that gate.
[5:01:03] <+cgkonnor> The Shriveled Titan
[5:01:07] <+vaderxyz1970> I JUST NOTICE THE TAINT JIGGLE
[5:01:09] <Partial_Recall_> are they giants in this, or trolls
[5:01:11] <+0neReeler> people probably just run by
[5:01:13] <%akajaybay> this is definitely a you dont need to kill everything roadblock for folks who just come on in right away
[5:01:14] <KyberNasse> ATTACK (on) TITAN
[5:01:18] <Happy_D_> Has he done weeping peninsula yet? I feel he should do that first?
[5:01:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> next-gen grundle physics
[5:01:27] <%VladVandal> trolls @partial_recall_
[5:01:28] <mothdude> They're referred to as both trolls and giants iirc
[5:01:34] <Aussie_Manny> Switch to your 3DM Gear! D:
[5:01:46] <%Gruhunchously> Why are these crossbowmen helping him?
[5:01:46] <RyuuAoi> Reconsider?
[5:01:48] <+robertoszek> @vaderxyz1970 why must you inflict me with this forbidden knowledge
[5:01:48] <xXFlyingBrickXx> tatakae tatakae
[5:01:49] <kazadaz> Eh, I did most of Stormveil before the peninsula, it's tough but it's not bullshit-hard
[5:01:52] <0078thunder> locking on horse only leads to bad results ive found
[5:01:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> they're Giant Trolls, just like chat Kappa
[5:02:05] <+theoldone001> It was disappointing to hear ENB complain that he could just run past all these guys in an open world game where you have to choice to engage or not. Its like the dude forgot what fun is.
[5:02:09] <zenith0111> Giants is the faction race Trolls is the common Giants
[5:02:23] <RyuuAoi> Woof
[5:02:25] <%JetpackMcQuack> problem solved
[5:02:41] <KyberNasse> I mean I could just run past enemies in Dark Souls too
[5:02:44] <Aussie_Manny> gottem
[5:02:45] <Iniudan> @0078thunder There is some mob where locking work better, but indeed most fight end up better been unlocked.
[5:02:48] <%akajaybay> I fought this guy early on and was so annoyed when I realized it just comes back
[5:02:48] <r00d1m3n7> buddy you are FLYING through this shit
[5:02:52] <Wolfwood315> he is
[5:02:54] <Aussie_Manny> Didn't even need to aim for the neck.
[5:02:55] <@Menitta> Yes
[5:02:56] <+0neReeler> @theoldone001 'souls can only be played this way'
[5:02:56] <%Xelhesia> yup
[5:02:57] <scarletgameshow> @0078thunder locking on horse is good when needed, it's situational
[5:03:00] <+OniOniOniiii> lurkin
[5:03:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[5:03:24] <kazadaz> "See that giant in the distance?  You can climb it"
[5:03:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:03:30] <%hax_metatron> Yea just one :)
[5:03:37] <+robertoszek> @theoldone001 did he not run past the drakes on the valley of drakes as everyone else? it's not an issue of elden ring being open-world
[5:03:41] <+theoldone001> @0neReeler It was also eye opening of the shit takes on his streams when people said music after Demon's Souls was not very good and he agreed with it.
[5:03:44] <Happy_D_> lol
[5:03:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> be wary of the dootsman
[5:03:59] <+Snazzy_Tomato> oh is he gonna fight him?

[5:04:40] <@Menitta> RATTLE EM BOYS
[5:04:43] <+Sir_Louis> SKELETON WARRIORS
[5:04:52] <+JT_Jag> honestly the lone wolves are the worst summon in the game imo
[5:04:56] <+theoldone001> Skeletons and Jellyfish carried me through early game
[5:04:59] <zenith0111> All summons have their purpose I feel
[5:05:00] <+JT_Jag> they're made of paper and do no damage
[5:05:08] <@Menitta> but they're so cool tho...
[5:05:11] <%akajaybay> the speed on the wolves works real well for interruptable folks
[5:05:17] <+JT_Jag> there's way cooler
[5:05:17] <KyberNasse> Goblin Gang Summon is hilarious

[5:05:58] <Aussie_Manny> Then they do the Skeleton Dance as they trottle off
[5:06:01] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I wonder why they call it Storm Hill pieThink
[5:06:01] <+Order_of_Mystery> fuckin WIMDY
[5:06:02] <%JetpackMcQuack> very stormy
[5:06:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> hey what's that over there :)
[5:06:08] <FaxineiroDePosto> unless...
[5:06:09] <Wolfwood315> this dude is tough stuff
[5:06:10] <+Stormiercashew> here we go
[5:06:11] <%insomniacCoder> @zenith0111 yeah, depends on the enemies
[5:06:12] <Iniudan> @JT_Jag The worst summon is the noble, wolves are good depending on what you fight, as they are pretty nimble, thus avoid a lot of hit, but indeed don't have a whole lot of health.
[5:06:14] <crimsonharvest> gowl
[5:06:18] <kazadaz> They should call it Sheepveil hill

[5:07:04] <Wolfwood315> you just have to be close to the gaol for the stake, no need to find it
[5:07:05] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Which one did Woolie fight last time?
[5:07:07] <@Solidus_113> you don't have to personally find the statue, it'll just be active

[5:07:15] <+KBGuilty> @RyuuAoi hes using the weapon from it, yes
[5:07:20] <crimsonharvest> the statue just works you dont need to know about it beforehand
[5:07:26] <NBUsagi> Well i see why they call it Stromveil
[5:07:29] <+0neReeler> weird how the first gaol he was at has a statue right next, but not all?
[5:07:34] <RyuuAoi> @kbguilty Good on ya mate!

[5:17:08] <+theoldone001> There is a proximity, I learned that the hard way
[5:17:13] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus stake icon is under your bars as a buff
[5:17:16] <+justianxix> you can check in your buff tab if you're near one
[5:17:17] <linSP> hit triangle and see if the icon is active

[5:17:32] <lbCyber> crucible knight finds your magic cute
[5:17:44] <+OniOniOniiii> oh yea i keep forgetting that
[5:17:50] <velgaduere> Darknut says "lol"

[5:18:33] <+Fetrigon> oh boi
[5:18:34] <Wolfwood315> I'm stoked for when he really gets into this fight
[5:18:34] <+zepherl> For me Crucible Knight just glitched out and started walking into a wall doing nothing the entire time, so I shot him down with arrows and he died and I won
[5:18:35] <+Sir_Louis> Crucible Knight is REAL
[5:18:39] <perfect_disaster> this guy is crazy
[5:18:39] <lbCyber> no capri suns allowed
[5:18:39] <emptyantics> Input reading

[5:18:49] <linSP> The stomp instakills me
[5:18:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> sick of getting backstabbed
[5:18:54] <+theoldone001> Do you ever learn the regular earth stomp? I know Hoarfrost Stomp is a thing
[5:18:58] <%oneimportantthing> You ain't seen moves yet Reg
[5:19:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @zepherl bummer, you missed out on some cool shit, but a w is a w
[5:19:03] <zenith0111> His shield is the part that gets me heated
[5:19:09] <user_naim> Lothric Castle would be proud
[5:19:10] <Wolfwood315> RT after you do the backflip
[5:19:11] <+yungkame> the whole squad got poise
[5:19:14] <%Prevot> Crucible Knight is the 2nd hardest thing I've fought in the game so far
[5:19:19] <+anoldtoilet> it SUPER DOES
[5:19:20] <Wolfwood315> it dodges twice!
[5:19:22] <%RyTYoung> Ohh you‚Äôll see
[5:19:24] <+anoldtoilet> the 2nd dash in has iframes
[5:19:27] <+Proxzo> it has iframes on special
[5:19:29] <+fizzguy47> CK converts from the stomp 100% of the time
[5:19:37] <+Proxzo> iframes on r2 follow up
[5:19:40] <Uncle_Christian> @WoolieVersus tell me you are using this time to level up before attacking the 1st big boss
[5:19:41] <+anoldtoilet> not the first move, but the followup step has like, actually a lot of iframes
[5:19:47] <Aussie_Manny> üò©
[5:19:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> crucible knight needs to relax
[5:19:54] <%RyTYoung> HES RUNNING

[5:20:23] <+0neReeler> i like bosses where you only get a sip when you dodge an attack
[5:20:25] <stevenellis386> that cry of pain
[5:20:29] <Uncle_Christian> Woolie upon your Horse
[5:20:34] <%p4ntless> crucible knight asks one question and it is not "would you like a sippy?"
[5:20:41] <%VladVandal> this guy is an absolute chad on the battlefield
[5:20:43] <%RyTYoung> The female‚Äôs pain cry makes me feel like I‚Äôm getting winded

[5:22:14] <DigiDom> its readable
[5:22:16] <%Prevot> the reach of his sword is dishonest as fuck
[5:22:18] <@Solidus_113> I forget if you can jump that stomp
[5:22:18] <Uncle_Christian> Time for summoning Roger
[5:22:19] <+0neReeler> instead of kicking the sheidl, stomp the yard
[5:22:20] <perfect_disaster> but honest
[5:22:21] <velgaduere> runes
[5:22:21] <tidesplitter27> If you time your rolls right the shield charge and the forward stab are your best chances to attack
[5:22:22] <PERCYMaybach> how far does the stomp go?
[5:22:22] <RyuuAoi> How's that shield?
[5:22:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> He's very much parryable
[5:22:26] <%RyTYoung> He‚Äôs a ruthless bastard when you‚Äôre under levelled/on level
[5:22:26] <%Majkir> I never managed to break one of these guys' posture.
[5:22:28] <Wolfwood315> yeah, his reach is insane
[5:22:28] <BigPapatheFirst> parries are the goat for this fight
[5:22:29] <%Side_Character101> @Wolfwood315 nice! can't wait for them to see that SNK honesty!
[5:22:34] <+anoldtoilet> he has super insanely high posture yeah
[5:22:36] <Kaji04> Crucible sucks
[5:22:36] <%ekodrop> @Solidus_113 yes
[5:22:36] <%akajaybay> no summon in the gaols
[5:22:39] <lesserkarl> yeah these knights are total bullshit to fight
[5:22:40] <Jewoodsforreal> This guy is really strong, you might be here for a while
[5:22:45] <+anoldtoilet> you CAN do it if you have a great hammer or something youre more likely to see it
[5:22:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> honestly over your shit
[5:22:48] <Hoot_Patoots> parries or barricade if you wanna be tanky to
[5:22:52] <+scarman125> imagine having the balls to try and parry this dude
[5:22:52] <jam_chamoy> its takes like 4 or 5 sling rocks to break posture
[5:22:52] <user_naim> This is good training though
[5:22:53] <Aussie_Manny> these caterpillars are big fans of this guy, I guess
[5:22:54] <Uncle_Christian> R!
[5:22:55] <DelgotHansto> does CK even have a stagger animation LUL
[5:23:01] <+0neReeler> horrible trade
[5:23:01] <Uncle_Christian> oops I meant R1
[5:23:03] <user_naim> Good info, good practice
[5:23:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> @scarman125 It's how I had to beat him
[5:23:08] <%sherlockkat> I just poisoned him towards the end of phase 1 with poison armament
[5:23:09] <velgaduere> @DelgotHansto not from being hit normally
[5:23:10] <perfect_disaster> L2 did it for me
[5:23:10] <+zepherl> if you inflict sleep on him he staggers
[5:23:11] <huskarl_zap> poise break needs two plus 10 warhammers
[5:23:12] <+theoldone001> This guy is good training for Margit and Godrick
[5:23:18] <RyuuAoi> Okay so you CAN block his swings. That is promising.
[5:23:21] <agustorm123> That wet noodle attack LUL
[5:23:21] <thaprinnydood> interesting tidbit chat gaols is pronounced as jail
[5:23:25] <Uncle_Christian> Margit is too tough
[5:23:26] <linSP> yup I had to perfect parry him with my squishy mage
[5:23:27] <+MosesUnspoken> Ahh, my nemesis.
[5:23:35] <KyberNasse> Guh oooooool
[5:23:37] <+Order_of_Mystery> you can sleep CK?!
[5:23:42] <rReizs> its very satisfying once you get the parries right
[5:23:48] <Wolfwood315> yeah I found godrick way easier than margit which is a shame since margit is first
[5:23:50] <+zepherl> @Order_of_Mystery ye
[5:23:51] <%JetpackMcQuack> engenders passivity
[5:23:53] <%Indigo_Automaton> @linSP Same, I wasn't doing enough damage or stagger so I had to get as many parries in as I could
[5:23:55] <%radiorosewater> getting in the crucible
[5:23:57] <Aussie_Manny> omg that thrust is deceptively long
[5:24:02] <+Order_of_Mystery> omg
[5:24:02] <%sherlockkat> You just kinda have to dark souls it. 1 swing at a time everytimne he gives an opening
[5:24:03] <NBUsagi> This dude has mad follow ups
[5:24:03] <+jolezef> HE'S STARTING TO BELIEVE
[5:24:03] <user_naim> I need to fuck with sleep at some point, I haven‚Äôt even touched it
[5:24:07] <perfect_disaster> he missed!
[5:24:13] <+JT_Jag> This guy seems incredibly guard counterable
[5:24:20] <+theoldone001> The stomp is deceptive too, you think you're out of range and still get clipped by it
[5:24:24] <stevenellis386> that stomp is so cool
[5:24:25] <crimsonharvest> i hate getting stabbed in the mouth like that
[5:24:29] <Aussie_Manny> give me a THRUST ü§∫
[5:24:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:24:34] <agustorm123> Crucible Knight is a bully
[5:24:35] <%Prevot> @jt_jag good luck having enough stamina for that
[5:24:38] <%JetpackMcQuack> there's always another move
[5:24:39] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The stomp combo is a long string
[5:24:40] <NBUsagi> \o/
[5:24:40] <+Fetrigon> keepin it real
[5:24:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> such a badass tho
[5:24:42] <KyberNasse> Caught you sippin
[5:24:43] <%DiscoMatador> We makin PROGRESS tho
[5:24:44] <%radiorosewater> teaowlGrimace
[5:24:46] <%plsunbanmyacc> shielding is a bait
[5:24:47] <%sherlockkat> The stomp is very active too.
[5:24:48] <perfect_disaster> yeah that attack got me many times
[5:24:48] <+yeknomlive> crucible knights doing strings
[5:24:50] <jam_chamoy> 2 spins
[5:24:51] <RyuuAoi> You can do this, Woolie. We chippin but we do it!
[5:24:52] <rReizs> stomp overhead double spin
[5:24:53] <zhenthrim213> i got fucked by these guys so much i now wear their armor and use their moves
[5:24:54] <%RyTYoung> Rolling is the way
[5:24:55] <CommandantKobold> teaowlArrive
[5:24:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Inch resting
[5:24:57] <%Reveresao> when he two hands just get away from him
[5:24:58] <+Fetrigon> no let's stall out
[5:24:59] <Someguy893> you will get hit before guard counters come out
[5:25:03] <yomario876> main road
[5:25:09] <+Sir_Louis> no yeah thats the right idea
[5:25:10] <Wolfwood315> rolling in is indeed the way
[5:25:11] <+Fetrigon> kick his ass woolie
[5:25:13] <Aussie_Manny> There is overworld progress, and boss progress.
[5:25:14] <lesserkarl> he'll mix up his timings just to fuck with your parries though
[5:25:15] <user_naim> I mean whatever you wanna do
[5:25:22] <TigerClaws12> he input reads like a mf'er
[5:25:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> TWIST HIS DICK
[5:25:29] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk
[5:25:34] <user_naim> @kosorsomesaykosm_ true
[5:25:35] <MrMoonGoose> THE OL DICK TWIST
[5:25:35] <RyuuAoi> Face fuck and back stab? He seems pretty straight forward.
[5:25:48] <Frazbeee> just whittle him donw
[5:25:53] <bamith23> Game is gonna be like 120 hours regardless Woolie
[5:25:53] <+theoldone001> I love how being able to say I'll come back is a viable thing and I never feel bad that the game wants me to come back. Just more content to do later, it's great.
[5:25:56] <oatmeal10> Parry
[5:25:58] <TigerClaws12> give em the ol dick twist
[5:25:58] <iacus_> not just late but massive hitbox holy shit
[5:26:07] <BreakersAweigh> this one humbles you, man
[5:26:10] <zhenthrim213> welcome to the crucible
[5:26:17] <PERCYMaybach> stab hitbox is like around him lol
[5:26:21] <@Solidus_113> unrelenting
[5:26:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> my turn
[5:26:26] <Frazbeee> SMACKED
[5:26:26] <TigerClaws12> what's the lowest hp has woolie gotten it chat?
[5:26:29] <+Jiggisnipe> so cool
[5:26:30] <Happy_D_> I just hope he finds the artist shack nearby
[5:26:30] <BreakersAweigh> SUSUME
[5:26:30] <Kaji04> THE CAN OPENER
[5:26:33] <RyuuAoi> Coach, Reggie! Coach!
[5:26:34] <%AngryAsian5> He sensed weakness LUL
[5:26:35] <+zepherl> gotta try magic
[5:26:36] <+0neReeler> offense
[5:26:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Crucible knight puts the fear in you like a grappler
[5:26:36] <+CherteuseKapibara> I hope they like fighting this guy :)
[5:26:39] <BreakersAweigh> ADVANCE
[5:26:41] <emptyantics> He‚Äôs got OTG‚Äôs!
[5:26:42] <PERCYMaybach> crucible knight has to keep moving forward liek the attack titan
[5:26:44] <bamith23> @Happy_D_ Already did and got the treasure
[5:26:46] <+JT_Jag> I find that just as a rule, in this game dodging backwards is death
[5:26:47] <+RegularCore> Crucible knight is a masher
[5:26:48] <user_naim> That stomp is fun
[5:26:49] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Someone mentioned a Pursuer? This guy pursues like you owe him money.
[5:26:49] <SilverFaustX> i imagine a full choir following u around and start singing at boss fights
[5:26:52] <%ChillaxingJay> crumpSuffer
[5:26:55] <+bluedude153> Found out today that upgrading your shield upgrades the stanima you lose when blocking, and nothing in games shows this
[5:27:05] <%sherlockkat> He keeps moving forward until all his enemies are destroyed.
[5:27:07] <Hirumm> @TigerClaws12 not very low, he just started
[5:27:09] <velgaduere> does it correspond to where you died?
[5:27:13] <TigerClaws12> @Hirumm gotcha
[5:27:14] <%Xelhesia> yes
[5:27:14] <stevenellis386> fuck seems like you gotta parry him
[5:27:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @bluedude153 Holy shit for real?
[5:27:18] <+0neReeler> its where you died in other dimension
[5:27:18] <+OniOniOniiii> he kicked it after you died lol
[5:27:19] <+Proxzo> it's where you died in the evergaol. in the other dimension.
[5:27:20] <Aussie_Manny> GET this shit outta my ring!
[5:27:26] <iacus_> they are where you died plus/minus some sync lag
[5:27:36] <+Jiggisnipe> damn
[5:27:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> P E R F E C T
[5:27:38] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, I robbed you. Of your dignity. wifiPathetic
[5:27:39] <%Prevot> LUL
[5:27:40] <%hax_metatron> It‚Äôs where you die in the Evergaol
[5:27:42] <+bluedude153> For real, upgrades the block by 3 per level. My discord lost its mind when we found out
[5:27:42] <SilverFaustX> free
[5:27:42] <+Fetrigon> goddamn
[5:27:43] <TigerClaws12> ggs, it was close tho
[5:27:43] <stevenellis386> god those cries of pain
[5:27:44] <%BestTeaMaker> close
[5:27:45] <primarch_lupercal> he's in solitary. what does he need the money for
[5:27:45] <RyuuAoi> Textbook combo
[5:27:46] <+Jiggisnipe> I respect it tho
[5:27:48] <agustorm123> This guy is hype tho
[5:27:53] <bamith23> @bluedude153 That's a thing in other games, its just less obvious since you need multiple levels here I think
[5:27:54] <KyberNasse> Jesus
[5:27:54] <%plsunbanmyacc> can only parry on handed horizontal strikes i think
[5:27:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> This guy is actually the main character
[5:27:55] <zhenthrim213> @CanadianAnimatorGuy yea i think its gaurd boost stat
[5:27:55] <+theoldone001> that's his BnB
[5:28:04] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah that makes sense
[5:28:06] <Wolfwood315> all it does is face you up the hill
[5:28:09] <+OrangeMDT> Yo he‚Äôs pretty honest
[5:28:10] <Wolfwood315> it's not anywhere different
[5:28:11] <+CherteuseKapibara> he can be staggered :)
[5:28:14] <Wolfwood315> it just turns you around
[5:28:23] <emptyantics> The most honest Souls character
[5:28:25] <+0neReeler> damn that dude got launched
[5:28:29] <agustorm123> Dont cheese him
[5:28:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> spells are doing some nice damage tho
[5:28:42] <user_naim> @agustorm123 we can take the edge off
[5:28:48] <Hirumm> jump attack is strong tech against him
[5:28:48] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> beating CK with dual greatswords was SOOOOOOO worth
[5:28:49] <huskarl_zap> game is not honest everyone knows the ai cheats it's been tested
[5:28:49] <Uncle_Christian> Learn those attacks to counter em
[5:28:50] <RyuuAoi> Naw. Cheese it the fuck out!
[5:28:54] <user_naim> give ‚Äôem a couple of these
[5:29:03] <%Intersceptre> eff this guy
[5:29:05] <agustorm123> Is a fair fight
[5:29:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> tickled your nose with that one
[5:29:13] <%Side_Character101> I hear this guy started the Honest Company
[5:29:13] <Uncle_Christian> Dam
[5:29:14] <+Jiggisnipe> wow
[5:29:17] <%plsunbanmyacc> shielding is a bait woolie
[5:29:18] <+JT_Jag> woolie really needs to learn to roll forward
[5:29:18] <stevenellis386> damn
[5:29:19] <TigerClaws12> yo it's release Strive Sol Keepo
[5:29:19] <Kaji04> the good ol dick twist
[5:29:19] <lbCyber> eff your poise
[5:29:23] <RyuuAoi> Fair my ass LUL
[5:29:26] <Uncle_Christian> you are not ready
[5:29:26] <Someguy893> do not block the stomp
[5:29:30] <perfect_disaster> that spin WutFace
[5:29:31] <+CherteuseKapibara> Honest mids
[5:29:35] <zhenthrim213> yea the stomp is my bane
[5:29:37] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Stomp is shield break
[5:29:38] <OblivionSword1> oh right jump
[5:29:38] <bamith23> Jump the stomp would be pretty wicked
[5:29:38] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> rolls. also can jump over stomp
[5:29:46] <Hoot_Patoots> you can jump over the stomp too
[5:29:48] <DigiDom> you can jump or use i frames on a roll
[5:29:52] <Hoot_Patoots> anything seismic thing really
[5:29:57] <+JT_Jag> yeah every ground effect attack can be jumped
[5:29:58] <%plsunbanmyacc> @intersceptre let him find shit instead of spoiling friend
[5:30:02] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Try jumping on his head like Mario
[5:30:06] <bamith23> I need to try jumping over more moves for style.
[5:30:09] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> rolls 4 days
[5:30:35] <perfect_disaster> off camera?
[5:30:37] <+Xeno351> the hitboxes in this game are sooooooooooo good
[5:30:39] <jacknerik> I love how you can see the phantoms of other players getting their shit rocked
[5:30:40] <Aussie_Manny> This dude hits HARD.
[5:30:40] <Dotados> I hope he gets to half hp
[5:30:40] <Pyrrhus90> the mount & blade player in me wonders if you can use bow and arrow on horseback
[5:30:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[5:30:49] <%Intersceptre> @plsunbanmyacc i just got here idk what he's seen
[5:30:54] <%Intersceptre> my bad
[5:30:55] <+Jiggisnipe> I love how imposing they are
[5:30:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> Most of his swings are parryable
[5:30:57] <stevenellis386> did pat beat this guy?
[5:30:57] <Blank9> you can use bow and arrow horseback
[5:30:59] <Frazbeee> apply blood grease woolie
[5:31:00] <+Jessie_Lockhart> We labbing?
[5:31:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Pyrrhus90 you can, as well as magic
[5:31:03] <%Indigo_Automaton> Just precise timing
[5:31:04] <+anoldtoilet> woolie making good reads
[5:31:04] <RyuuAoi> Dudes got like 200 lbs on you
[5:31:09] <Kaji04> i thought all the swings were parriable
[5:31:12] <emptyantics> Blood grease would melt this man Kreygasm
[5:31:20] <Pyrrhus90> cool thx guys
[5:31:26] <+anoldtoilet> ive been doing invasions for like 2 hours this game is fun
[5:31:37] <RyuuAoi> That stinger tho
[5:31:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:31:49] <+CalderGaming> @pyrrhus90 you can but unfortunately you can't aim 360 degrees, just a ~180 degree arc in front of you
[5:31:52] <%Intersceptre> Crucible is the embodiment of 99 END
[5:31:56] <truegreed> oh shit it's Crucible knight i've been trying to find him for such a long time
[5:32:05] <lbCyber> He's absolutely committed to keeping your stamina at 0
[5:32:06] <+zepherl> one neat thing i only learned recently is that jumping has i-frames like rolling does
[5:32:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> there's the window
[5:32:08] <Uncle_Christian> he's in no hurry,why are you?
[5:32:13] <RyuuAoi> He comin
[5:32:18] <+Jiggisnipe> so aggressive
[5:32:22] <emptyantics> Crucible knight is such a great boss
[5:32:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> just win
[5:32:31] <Aussie_Manny> Can you parry any time with any shield, as long as the move's parry-able?
[5:32:33] <truegreed> He dont care about no parry monkaS
[5:32:39] <user_naim> His shield sure doesn‚Äôt engender passivity huh
[5:32:40] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> gotta watch the hand
[5:32:42] <%Intersceptre> @truegreed there's this one, but he's by no emans a one-off
[5:32:45] <+mechslayer71> Wonder if woolies gonna get to see the REALLY fun part
[5:32:46] <iacus_> the parry has a certain timing window
[5:32:57] <+zepherl> @Aussie_Manny parry only works on shields with the parry art of war
[5:33:02] <RyuuAoi> He's slow. Just a bunch of stamina
[5:33:03] <@Irridium> this dude was a wall for me.
[5:33:06] <%Deosier> @Aussie_Manny if the move is parryable and the shield got parry weapon skill
[5:33:07] <emptyantics> Parry has a 2 frame window
[5:33:20] <Aussie_Manny> It's only on a specific art of war? Aww man... doodSad
[5:33:23] <truegreed> @Intersceptre I've just been trying to find this encounter again, I know of the other one. This fight got cycled out for me so i'm just trying to find it again
[5:33:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's a narrow parry window, but even that drag swing he does on the ground is parryable
[5:33:27] <Uncle_Christian> 1 hit is worth it
[5:33:33] <+robertoszek> we need the LED sign "LAB OPEN"
[5:33:36] <%Intersceptre> @Irridium I think this is what Pat alluded to when he said the Evergaol's are not zone-level specific
[5:33:45] <agustorm123> he is two shooting you that means your HP sucks bro
[5:33:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> the timing is more generous with light shields right?
[5:33:48] <%plsunbanmyacc> its not worth parrying
[5:33:49] <Someguy893> most of his moves can be parried
[5:33:49] <RyuuAoi> Couple ,ore, Woolie
[5:33:51] <RyuuAoi> More
[5:33:53] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> roll into him. aggressiveness is rewarded
[5:33:53] <+vaderxyz1970> The animation on these guys is amazing
[5:34:03] <%Indigo_Automaton> The easiest swing to parry for me was the overhead he does after his shield bash
[5:34:09] <Someguy893> just needs the timing
[5:34:21] <+yeknomlive> can anyone confirm does this game has ds3 parry rules with 2 handing colossal weps?
[5:34:32] <rReizs> point blank is also easier to parry than the tip
[5:34:37] <+yeknomlive> where they cant be parried like at all unless it's a rolling more or w/e
[5:34:43] <%Intersceptre> @yeknomlive as in, you can't parry certain stuff? yes.
[5:34:44] <emptyantics> He‚Äôs tough but when I powerstancehe became alot easier
[5:34:52] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> You got this Woolie!!! VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[5:34:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think it's doable, not having many flasks means you gota be very careful though
[5:34:52] <+Jiggisnipe> it's cool that this boss is a wall but not a wall to progress
[5:34:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> he loves his sheild
[5:35:03] <dralakbadusk> Guys i found it, our guiding moonlight DBstyle
[5:35:26] <+BishopBain> Oh boy, this guy ruined my whole day. Good luck Woolie.
[5:35:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> tire him out with a few laps
[5:35:39] <+RegularCore> this guy is real
[5:35:52] <+OniOniOniiii> he loves that stomp jeez lol
[5:35:56] <dralakbadusk> this is honestly the best arena to fight him, and that sucks so much lol
[5:35:58] <stevenellis386> its scary to parry this guy
[5:36:02] <+KillinYaDreamz> did he get to the wings yet?
[5:36:02] <RyuuAoi> Everything minus that stomp and stinger seems to be blockable. You can do this, Woolie
[5:36:06] <Kaji04> no shrimp or he die
[5:36:07] <%ekodrop> this strat is great until it ain't
[5:36:09] <Uncle_Christian> strafe?
[5:36:21] <+Peterbyte_> I honestly found this guy harder than Margit
[5:36:26] <RyuuAoi> Get that ass!
[5:36:31] <Aussie_Manny> JEEZ
[5:36:31] <dralakbadusk> RESPECT THAT SHILD BASH
[5:36:31] <mothdude> Best arena to fight him is one where you can get him to go off a ledge
[5:36:33] <Hirumm> good attempt!
[5:36:41] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> progress VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[5:36:46] <depressioncherrie> Has Woolie even upgraded his weapon yet? I feel like this becomes a lot more doable with a +2/+3 weapon
[5:36:46] <truegreed> His one two just catches GingerPower
[5:36:46] <huskarl_zap> unblockable trackable overheads
[5:36:50] <+FadingEmber> @WoolieVersus you can get a hit or 2 in when he walks into the arena
[5:36:54] <RyuuAoi> Just keep going
[5:36:56] <moonbearbacon> you keep from him from him
[5:36:58] <%BlakkCat538> Have they fought Margit yet?
[5:37:00] <+0neReeler> how it goes
[5:37:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm down to watch
[5:37:03] <Aussie_Manny> hahah, fair enough
[5:37:05] <%Reveresao> no
[5:37:09] <user_naim> I‚Äôm down for whatever
[5:37:17] <confusedpig11> I've done around 6 evergoals and that ones still the hardest i've seen.
[5:37:18] <Uncle_Christian> !tacos
[5:37:18] <RyuuAoi> Anime will skip this fight  and go straight to the V ha
[5:37:18] <+vaderxyz1970> "So I didn't get him next session...."
[5:37:24] <Hirumm> we want this content
[5:37:32] <RyuuAoi> @hirumm Yes
[5:37:33] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> I'm here with support for training
[5:37:44] <+Jiggisnipe> content means different things and progress means different things, watching Woolie learn this is dope
[5:37:45] <dralakbadusk> @confusedpig11 i just found one where i survived for exacty 5 seconds :3
[5:37:48] <Uncle_Christian> and cut
[5:37:49] <buerdo> I didn't beat the guy till lol 50 with +5 weapon
[5:37:50] <%Indigo_Automaton> You can get a full charged swing in before he spawns
[5:37:51] <+theoldone001> Hey, Lab is content to me.
[5:37:54] <RyuuAoi> It's a manga, Woolie. Filler arch is needed.
[5:37:56] <+Xeno351> the real one was the biggest wall for me
[5:38:09] <+Jiggisnipe> turns out the lab was progress and content
[5:38:13] <+FadingEmber> @WoolieVersus it was probably better for me cause I ran strength sorry
[5:38:21] <+Amaideus> I magic'd him to death from afar so I don't even remember this fight
[5:38:28] <+Grayhammatter> this was a one i had to come back to, but you can do that grind
[5:38:29] <dralakbadusk> @xeno351  do you now how little that narrows it down? lol
[5:38:30] <user_naim> The scary delays get you caught in the quick stomp. What a fun dude to fight
[5:38:39] <%Faultlined> I appreciate the tenacity I would of walked away by now to another area
[5:38:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:38:40] <%CaptainBeird> you do you woolie!
[5:38:41] <+zepherl> @Amaideus LUL
[5:38:42] <Aussie_Manny> I appreciate the cut-off, and showing the success next time. I think it's a good idea.
[5:38:44] <+theoldone001> git gud is good content in Soulsborne. Watching people learn is hype.
[5:38:46] <Uncle_Christian> Woolie needs Ghiza's Wheel Secret Weapon
[5:38:47] <Blank9> thisguyisrough
[5:38:50] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu KEEP creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu GRINDING creepy49Porporu creepy49Porporu
[5:38:51] <+Xeno351> @dralakbadusk I mean do you see who we fighting
[5:38:54] <+vaderxyz1970> I just dragon fired him from affar till he died
[5:38:54] <+pectusumbra> why not use your magic slicer?
[5:39:00] <$Dreigun> love seeing all the random white phantoms just getting launched around in the background
[5:39:06] <@Menitta> oh jeez close
[5:39:07] <Uncle_Christian> lsmarkSpin tallshaLUL
[5:39:14] <+KillinYaDreamz> the hardest fight is the enemy that cant fight back. so many tears lol
[5:39:19] <+Jiggisnipe> @Aussie_Manny yea it works really well and it let's him enjoy the game off stream
[5:39:19] <@Menitta> OOH
[5:39:20] <AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Adventure calls! He'll be here waiting stoic as a mf SeemsGood
[5:39:20] <Hirumm> how long did this take Max?
[5:39:23] <+JT_Jag> woolie's never going to win this fight if he keeps running backwards
[5:39:24] <dralakbadusk> @xeno351 yep lmao, at least this one theres an actual arena i guess
[5:39:32] <Uncle_Christian> rip
[5:39:33] <stevenellis386> deadly
[5:39:34] <moonbearbacon> dare you to run and spam spells
[5:39:45] <Uncle_Christian> spam spells? XD
[5:40:01] <+vaderxyz1970> become a stabbi boi?
[5:40:05] <dralakbadusk> all hail the dash ashen of war !
[5:40:09] <lymund> Try the weapon art lol
[5:40:25] <@Solidus_113> sounds like you want a katana Kappa
[5:40:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> can't get hit anyway
[5:40:33] <Hirumm> if you're gonna just try to roll it might be better to 2-hand
[5:40:36] <%Side_Character101> all spells, just run away and do spells
[5:40:36] <Uncle_Christian> There needs to be a Mod where the big boss is Homer Simpson
[5:40:37] <Someguy893> sounds like a STR problem
[5:40:39] <+CalderGaming> hit and run wants a faster weapon yeah
[5:40:39] <confusedpig11> I had to beat him with spell spam but even then you have to be patient and be descent at dodging his stuff.
[5:40:43] <+KillinYaDreamz> does he know you press l2 then 2r for the art
[5:40:44] <+zepherl> jumping instead of rolling would help stay on him and get swings in. and jumping r2 breaks posture well
[5:40:50] <+vaderxyz1970> dual bleed daggers are nice
[5:40:54] <+0neReeler> big str have to wait for specific opening
[5:41:03] <TigerClaws12> yea str weapons require more work
[5:41:07] <+Peterbyte_> i don't think he can bleed can he?
[5:41:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> can't even bleed him
[5:41:18] <+zepherl> the weapon art is also great and has a TON of poise, but that means taking hits as well
[5:41:20] <Uncle_Christian> two sword
[5:41:23] <OblivionSword1> worth labbing other weapons
[5:41:24] <dralakbadusk> you can frost him tho
[5:41:24] <+Chimeraelite> tbh that's what GS users excel in. Spacing and prediction. LS users like me get an easier time of it for sure
[5:41:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> can't hit him fast enough
[5:41:27] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Max found a good strat on this guy. Hope you check it out after you beat him.
[5:41:30] <%sherlockkat> Also, he has followups with varous degrees of delay, so a roll that covers some of his options will result in you get caught in other options.
[5:41:31] <+JT_Jag> Jump attacks?
[5:41:32] <+Peterbyte_> couldn't poison him either, its just an empty suit
[5:41:33] <%sherlockkat> Especially the stomp
[5:41:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Assuming you dont discover it yourself
[5:41:49] <@Solidus_113> crouching attack would be slightly faster than normal R1
[5:41:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> big man
[5:42:03] <%AngryAsian5> THICC man
[5:42:04] <%sherlockkat> @Peterbyte_ I did poison him
[5:42:07] <+Xeno351> I found it way easier to never use a shield. the 50 percent is big
[5:42:10] <+Jiggisnipe> Kappa
[5:42:12] <Hirumm> you can break him with like 4-5 jump attacks
[5:42:12] <Uncle_Christian> oh god
[5:42:17] <Uncle_Christian> femmef16Uhhok
[5:42:20] <+0neReeler> antiaired
[5:42:21] <+OniOniOniiii> i think you can get a backstab too if you clear the step to the side
[5:42:26] <jam_chamoy> i walked out for a sec. did woolz get to 2nd phase
[5:42:27] <+Jiggisnipe> frame perfect dodges PogChamp
[5:42:31] <+OniOniOniiii> hard to be ready for it tho
[5:42:33] <Uncle_Christian> backstab is barely there
[5:42:36] <DueSquash> Feels like a DS2 boss
[5:42:38] <Hirumm> @jam_chamoy nope
[5:42:38] <softbirby> does woolie know about using heavy attack after the war ash attack for a virgil dash?
[5:42:47] <jam_chamoy> ok thank you
[5:42:52] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Just do it perfect. Easy. pieSmug
[5:43:06] <Wolfwood315> @softbirby yeah, I've seen him use it. but not on this guy
[5:43:10] <RyuuAoi> @jessie_lockhart Yoshi ha cute
[5:43:17] <+theoldone001> What about guard counters? He seems primed for them
[5:43:30] <Uncle_Christian> lsmarkBrian  - you tried
[5:43:47] <clapbeatt> guard counters might not stagger him
[5:43:53] <+JT_Jag> I bet he's super parryable
[5:43:55] <Someguy893> they won't
[5:43:57] <clapbeatt> so you eat a fat hit
[5:44:05] <clapbeatt> and might even get interrupted
[5:44:07] <%sherlockkat> @theoldone001 I did try that against him for a bit. But blocking attacks takes away so much stamina and guard counter in itself is stamina intensive. He doesn't get staggered either. So he just swings afterwards and you just die.
[5:44:17] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @ryuuaoi edobeaRIP
[5:44:23] <Someguy893> you will get hit trying to guard counter
[5:44:27] <RyuuAoi> Does low key feel like you may have fought this same moveset in a DS game.
[5:44:27] <+Amaideus> You can GC a couple of attacks
[5:44:30] <+Amaideus> But not many
[5:44:34] <confusedpig11> Guard counter is too dangerous if it's not the last hit of his combo.
[5:44:36] <zenith0111> His shield is the worst part feels like no openings most the time
[5:44:39] <%akajaybay> he's got a quick turn
[5:44:42] <+OniOniOniiii> my only real advice is to fight these guys near elevators if possible lol
[5:44:50] <+Jiggisnipe> @RyuuAoi Mirror Knight maybe?
[5:44:52] <Uncle_Christian> stay away from the nutt
[5:44:55] <Aussie_Manny> hoooo
[5:44:55] <@Solidus_113> knowledge getting checked
[5:44:57] <+Xeno351> no you do
[5:44:58] <%Tadashi047> carian slicer?
[5:45:09] <DueSquash> Can this boss be parried?
[5:45:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, with big weapons rolling attacks are the name of the game with these guys
[5:45:14] <%RyTYoung> Yes
[5:45:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Post shield-bash is a very very slight window for an attack + roll, but not super worth it
[5:45:17] <+Peterbyte_> pretty sure it can
[5:45:19] <+Amaideus> You can punish the shield upper with a rolling attack if you recognize it early
[5:45:19] <+Chimeraelite> like a duck
[5:45:19] <%BestTeaMaker> @DueSquash yes
[5:45:20] <%RyTYoung> He can be parried
[5:45:21] <Wolfwood315> @OniOniOniiii this one is an evergaol. no landscape cheese available
[5:45:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> he brought tricks
[5:45:26] <+Amaideus> At least with a greatsword
[5:45:32] <+anoldtoilet> your crouching attack with big weapons is often very fast as well
[5:45:42] <+anoldtoilet> you can do quick crouch while standing attacks like tekken
[5:45:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1501085489138442243?t=tbwY9SrWPklCjWPsHZ_rOQ&s=19
[5:45:48] <user_naim> Like woolie said, it‚Äôs a pretty honest dodge/swing kind of thing
[5:45:54] <user_naim> just learnin‚Äô
[5:45:56] <Frazbeee> apply a grease to your weapon man
[5:45:58] <%JetpackMcQuack> he's studying you too I swear
[5:45:58] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I‚Äôd love to see global stats on which bosses had the most kills to their names
[5:46:03] <+Jiggisnipe> that combo
[5:46:15] <%BestTeaMaker> that combo is serious business
[5:46:22] <+vaderxyz1970> Look at that pose
[5:46:28] <clapbeatt> you can landscape cheese this one
[5:46:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Jessie_Lockhart the big R: "heh"
[5:46:33] <danknugglit> I was using a colossal sword for this guy and the only safe hit i could get was a parry
[5:46:33] <lbCyber> CK doesn't forgive mistakes
[5:46:35] <clapbeatt> but idk if its consistent
[5:46:39] <Sircloud2> Comeback later
[5:46:43] <+Chimeraelite> I adore watching people lab out bosses
[5:46:49] <Aussie_Manny> Recognize. GlitchCat
[5:46:54] <+JT_Jag> At the moment Woolie is maybe a bit too spread out on stats and is maybe not as strong as some other level 40-ish characters, which could be contributing here
[5:46:58] <+Chimeraelite> Considering I did the same with Elmer just earlier today for like a freaking hour
[5:47:03] <zenith0111> I love how like their wizarda, dragons, and demi-gods but just a badass with a sword will be the real struggle
[5:47:06] <+Peterbyte_> watching the pieces come together is always satisfying
[5:47:07] <%akajaybay> I'm feeling much better about my cowardly run away at all time and throw fireballs approach
[5:47:10] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Hmm that's the labbin shit I love to hear
[5:47:18] <+jaguarkek318> the one at stormveil took me 3 hrs
[5:47:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, getting stunned by the stomp is big bad
[5:47:24] <+jaguarkek318> glhf boiz
[5:47:26] <RyuuAoi> Strafe back stabs?
[5:47:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Also, Guard Counters are a thing as well
[5:47:32] <%BestTeaMaker> @zenith0111 all rooms where it's 1v1 a single person is always the most intimidating thing
[5:47:32] <RyuuAoi> Havel him up
[5:47:52] <Sircloud2> I don‚Äôt think he had enough stamina to tank a guard to counter
[5:47:53] <@Menitta> that did some damage
[5:47:55] <+Chimeraelite> Guard counters are only really good against dudes that can actually staggered Alex
[5:48:02] <+Chimeraelite> Plus slow weapon
[5:48:05] <+Jiggisnipe> @BestTeaMaker 1 dude who walks towards you too
[5:48:06] <+Chimeraelite> Alec*
[5:48:06] <Someguy893> I just applied magic weapon to my greatsword and 2handed the entire time, still took awhile.
[5:48:09] <%phd_in_thuggery> phd_in_thuggery subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Elden Ring has been my current addiction so I'm not gonna be here for most of the streams, but just know I love you guys and your work keeps me joyously laughing
[5:48:10] <RyuuAoi> That's evil
[5:48:17] <+Xeno351> yes
[5:48:21] <+Xeno351> literally yes
[5:48:32] <Sircloud2> Unless he uses the poise buff with the waifu
[5:48:32] <%phd_in_thuggery> twist his dick!
[5:48:34] <TigerClaws12> we do a little input reading
[5:48:39] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[5:48:41] <RyuuAoi> There we go! In and out on that ass
[5:48:44] <%ekodrop> caaaawwww
[5:48:44] <okamiizero> What equipment is giving him the max stamina up?
[5:48:51] <+vaderxyz1970> That foot shuffle animation
[5:48:54] <Aussie_Manny> That shield is horny af.
[5:48:58] <lbCyber> it feels like there's a much bigger time delay in this game between dropping your shield and being able to backstab
[5:48:59] <user_naim> iiiiaaaaahhh
[5:49:04] <%AngryAsian5> Gotta stay glued to the butt
[5:49:06] <RyuuAoi> He confused!
[5:49:18] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[5:49:52] <%AngryAsian5> LUL
[5:49:54] <agustorm123> He sure be like thanos
[5:49:55] <Aussie_Manny> lol
[5:50:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Funny enough the Stomp to 2 swings is the safest when you learn it
[5:50:09] <Aussie_Manny> Mr. Reggie, I don't feel so good... khadSnap
[5:50:10] <%akajaybay> i wonder if some quick status daggers would kick in enough
[5:50:11] <%Side_Character101> I hope they remember you
[5:50:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no more jiice
[5:50:18] <Wolfwood315> physick?
[5:50:20] <+Xeno351> the shield bash is so safe to go in on it's insane
[5:50:28] <agustorm123> Are you trying to backstab him?
[5:50:28] <+vaderxyz1970> I love that little hop he does for his launcher
[5:50:29] <confusedpig11> I thing when he scrapes the sword that's the delayed upswing
[5:50:46] <lbCyber> his delays are the worst
[5:50:49] <Hirumm> you got this woolie!
[5:50:49] <+JT_Jag> fishing for backstabs on this guy might be the strat
[5:51:04] <user_naim> can you even backstab this dude?
[5:51:07] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, its downloaded. You've got this.
[5:51:12] <user_naim> i never managed that
[5:51:13] <+chefframza> Man I have not caught up with the anime, Woolie got some drip
[5:51:15] <+Jiggisnipe> man
[5:51:33] <+andGalactus1> shovel knights big brother
[5:51:35] <Wolfwood315> I don't think you can backstab this guy at all
[5:51:42] <RyuuAoi> Yeah we chippin
[5:51:48] <knight_of_the_edge> hey woolie have you tried upgrading your weapons...you should have the stones for it.
[5:51:50] <%akajaybay> damage shift out of physical?
[5:51:55] <zzNamttamzz> has woolie upgraded the sword yet?
[5:51:57] <confusedpig11> practicing the parry timings for this dude might be an ok investment
[5:52:00] <+vaderxyz1970> Try carian slicer on this guy
[5:52:02] <AwesomeInABox> weapons scale so much being upgraded. makes doing stuff like this take so much less time.
[5:52:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> This guy reminds me of the Black/Silver Knights from DS1 but leveled up
[5:52:19] <+Jiggisnipe> oh man
[5:52:25] <+CalderGaming> *NPC summon
[5:52:25] <lbCyber> He might not be able to be backstabbed
[5:52:26] <bobxmaker> dude is relentless
[5:52:33] <Hirumm> he's learning PogChamp
[5:52:37] <+Zinri_Luck> this dude for real
[5:52:40] <%CaptainBeird> damn the clutch dodge there
[5:52:52] <+0neReeler> honest fight, no ashes or weapon elementals
[5:52:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:52:59] <RyuuAoi> Fuck that stomp
[5:53:02] <+Peterbyte_> hehe knights tail
[5:53:11] <+0neReeler> PogChamp
[5:53:20] <+Jiggisnipe> damn
[5:53:21] <emptyantics> Whatd I miss?!
[5:53:30] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Labbin
[5:53:30] <+keiji_maede> Get those heath points
[5:53:31] <clapbeatt> yeah this fight is mad annoying
[5:53:34] <confusedpig11> Ugh the followup after the power upswing is dirty
[5:53:36] <velgaduere> dude is super intense
[5:53:38] <TheSmerdis> that was a real good attempt overall
[5:53:42] <NBUsagi> Yeah no everyone i have seen fight this guy struggles
[5:53:44] <%plsunbanmyacc> doooo it
[5:53:46] <NBUsagi> he is just aggressive and brutal
[5:53:47] <+CalderGaming> time to hit the bricks
[5:53:48] <+Proxzo> GetSerious
[5:53:50] <%akajaybay> I left this guy for later and cheaped him, so respect
[5:53:50] <+vaderxyz1970> You got this Woolie!
[5:53:51] <%edgeroth> this is the game baby
[5:53:52] <+Zinri_Luck> he has a 2nd phase
[5:53:52] <Sircloud2> Dudes a wall come back k later
[5:53:56] <+JT_Jag> I'd just go somewhere else
[5:53:57] <moonbearbacon> have you explored other options?
[5:53:57] <+tnomads> yeah this is a strict fight
[5:54:00] <shadowboss89> Crucible Knight is sick
[5:54:01] <+Fetrigon> DO IIIIIITTTTT creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk creepy49Bonk
[5:54:01] <%Xelhesia> were behind u woolz
[5:54:02] <x2Twistedx> this dude took me 4 hours
[5:54:03] <+fizzguy47> What level is your weapon at?
[5:54:03] <+Amaideus> I say no, purely because you have limits to how far you can explore on your off time
[5:54:04] <%RemedyofRevenge> Woolie totally has this, but needs just a bit more damage on that sword
[5:54:06] <+0neReeler> harder than most regular bosses
[5:54:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he's real
[5:54:07] <lymund> Were here for it
[5:54:08] <%plsunbanmyacc> @zinri_luck let him discover shit bro
[5:54:08] <%sherlockkat> I beat him around level 50
[5:54:14] <%ekodrop> ngl i would come back
[5:54:14] <%jonblnt> Is this a come back latter fight?
[5:54:14] <+Amaideus> So I think you should expand your borders then come back later
[5:54:17] <%SirGO0SE> gamba? :)
[5:54:18] <+invalid_robin> @WoolieVersus have you upgraded any weapons?
[5:54:26] <+JT_Jag> it's wild to me that woolie never bought pebble
[5:54:32] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I dont think you‚Äôre ready for phase 2
[5:54:33] <+Peterbyte_> anyone know what level he is?
[5:54:33] <lbCyber> A bit more defense and vit could help down the road here too
[5:54:39] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> Hey Chat, has Woolie fought Margit yet?
[5:54:43] <+Amaideus> No
[5:54:46] <+Jiggisnipe> naw
[5:54:48] <+0neReeler> about to...
[5:54:53] <+vaderxyz1970> 2nd phase becomes part 3
[5:54:53] <%Cherokia666> is he?
[5:54:55] <user_naim> oh yeah we‚Äôre underleveled, but this is still cool
[5:54:56] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Margit is gonna be a treat
[5:54:57] <+Proxzo> This is a battle among blades
[5:55:00] <%MajorCrasher> this guy somehow blocks magic from behind, that's what made him such a massive pain to me
[5:55:03] <Gelphaze> woolieACCIDENT Half way then he becomes a problem!
[5:55:16] <+Amaideus> You seem to have an omnidirectional block sometimes in this game
[5:55:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[5:55:22] <+fizzguy47> he can't be stabbed in the back
[5:55:24] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Like he‚Äôs not a problem now?
[5:55:24] <%illtima> Executed
[5:55:30] <+Amaideus> I've blocked attacks from bosses that clearly hit me in the back
[5:55:32] <%edgeroth> i think you could roll the stomp attack
[5:55:40] <user_naim> That‚Äôs a good 1-2-3
[5:55:43] <+0neReeler> its fine just spend the time learning the margit matchup instead
[5:55:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> woolie is blocking a lot of stuff I notice
[5:55:45] <Sparda_blizzard> You can roll the stomp if you mash
[5:55:47] <Pistofficer> this dude beat me into dust so many times
[5:55:52] <%RemedyofRevenge> Can you parry the C Knight?
[5:55:59] <%BestTeaMaker> @RemedyofRevenge yes
[5:56:00] <%Pillagius> yes
[5:56:05] <@Irridium> @RemedyofRevenge yeah
[5:56:05] <x2Twistedx> yeah you can parry him
[5:56:14] <+fizzguy47> @sparda_blizzard mashing roll is a bad idea against him
[5:56:14] <Aussie_Manny> Gate of Babylon! üî™üî™üî™
[5:56:15] <%CaptainBeird> i've been hit in the back while blocking it's based off where you're locked on a certain night boss is an example of this
[5:56:25] <%edgeroth> nice roll
[5:56:38] <%Pillagius> Awesomely you can jump to dodge the stomp attack :D
[5:56:39] <+BananaSlammuh> That glintblade is pretty effective hitting him with the prper setup tho that's easier said than done
[5:56:48] <RyuuAoi> Risky business there
[5:56:56] <%jonblnt> Backstab?
[5:56:59] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> I one-shotted the Bloodhound Knight. But this dude.... this dude took me 2 days to beat
[5:57:09] <RyuuAoi> @jonblnt Doesn't seem like it
[5:57:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The environment is a problem
[5:57:14] <+vaderxyz1970> Turtle charm would help a lot for stamina regen
[5:57:21] <+JT_Jag> I think the problem here is there are a number of systems woolie has access to that he isn't using for this fight. weapon upgrades, other spells, parries, etc
[5:57:38] <lbCyber> pretty confident now he can't be backstabbed
[5:57:40] <zenith0111> I saw someone got stuck on him for almost 6 full days
[5:57:45] <+Jessie_Lockhart> He tried parries, just couldnt get it to work
[5:57:50] <Frazbeee> i think your underleveled for this one
[5:57:56] <+0neReeler> timing might be too tight
[5:58:00] <+JT_Jag> underlevelled and underspecialized
[5:58:02] <%edgeroth> its def doable
[5:58:05] <+Peterbyte_> im not ashamed to say it took me 3 days to kill this guy
[5:58:06] <+JT_Jag> he has no attack stats at 20 yet
[5:58:12] <RyuuAoi> One and done, Woolie. No rush.
[5:58:14] <Someguy893> got the pattern down
[5:58:15] <danknugglit> You can parry his 1h attacks
[5:58:16] <+pectusumbra> @JT_Jag To put it another way: Woolie's being way too honest for a Blanka player
[5:58:17] <+BananaSlammuh> That's not really a "problem" the great part is that it can be done
[5:58:18] <%edgeroth> you gotta believe
[5:58:18] <+robertoszek> better leave some homework to keep you entertained
[5:58:21] <+fizzguy47> @jt_jag the problem is CK is just a hard bastard, let him play how he wants
[5:58:21] <+Jiggisnipe> strafe strats tho
[5:58:24] <+HairyWario> keep going Woolie! Just beat this fight and it gets so cool after the second half.
[5:58:24] <+Jessie_Lockhart> This fight is possible, just requires patience
[5:58:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, blocking the stomp is a bad idea
[5:58:28] <DueSquash> Humanoid like bosses can be parried usually daquan2DaquanSamuels
[5:58:37] <Frazbeee> he hasnt even got him to 2/3 oh his hp
[5:58:38] <+HolyMANperor> NEVER block the stomp
[5:58:41] <DelgotHansto> Hesitation is...?
[5:58:42] <Dotados> in the shield bash you can too but you have to dodge inmediatly
[5:58:44] <+HairyWario> once you're done you feel like the matrix just installed a new program in your brain
[5:58:44] <lbCyber> there's going to be some dude who beats this game at level 1 with no rolling
[5:58:44] <+CrystalTree07> foot raised = dodge
[5:58:45] <%sherlockkat> He is very plus on block
[5:58:47] <+andGalactus1> the aprry time in this game is wacky though
[5:58:49] <+Zinri_Luck> double spin for sure the biggest opening
[5:58:51] <Aussie_Manny> So many attack patterns to memorise. NotLikeThis
[5:58:58] <+Jessie_Lockhart> There are few openings
[5:59:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> And even then you get one swing and thats it
[5:59:20] <+0neReeler> we only in the the training phase
[5:59:39] <DothMyNugsBequeathMe> Kappa
[5:59:42] <lbCyber> this has all been CK's introductory greeting
[5:59:55] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I love how hard this fight is and his name is CRUCIBLE Knight
[5:59:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:59:57] <%edgeroth> you can double roll the stomp into swing
[6:00:04] <Frazbeee> has he upgraded his weapon at all?
[6:00:05] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Trial by fire
[6:00:11] <moonbearbacon> that's the easy parry
[6:00:14] <+fizzguy47> he is difficult, but a fun fight overall
[6:00:14] <RyuuAoi> @edgeroth That's tight though. Real tight
[6:00:29] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Up to you Woolz
[6:00:34] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:00:46] <lbCyber> You've got the skills, woolz
[6:00:47] <RyuuAoi> This game WANTS you to tap out so hard.
[6:00:48] <+Jiggisnipe> that is true
[6:00:50] <+Jessie_Lockhart> This is still good content tho
[6:00:50] <%BestTeaMaker> at least try getting to half
[6:01:01] <+Jiggisnipe> but it's so fun tho
[6:01:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair, your options are this boss, and the boss that is the castle
[6:01:08] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @jessie_lockhart That Butt thing he does is pretty cheap though
[6:01:14] <@Irridium> As he's spawning in if you run up and swing you can get a hit in and back off before he starts
[6:01:32] <%MajorCrasher> honestly this guy makes everything in the castle look like a joke
[6:01:32] <emptyantics> You can always do these bosses offscreen and show us the replays later KPOPheart
[6:01:34] <Aussie_Manny> Fluorescent Knight
[6:01:41] <%Pillagius> One thing Woolie is forgetting about is the sword skill. It's beastly.
[6:01:47] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> I say butt because I don't wanna spoil it
[6:01:58] <+KBGuilty> Hey chat, question. Did Woolie get the hug‚Ñ¢ ?
[6:02:04] <+0neReeler> don't think i've seen him use it.. it's not that rolling thing is it
[6:02:04] <%Cherokia666> @emptyantics Yeah, he mentioned that about 15 tries ago. He do him
[6:02:06] <HystericalCH> ah the totally fair and balanced crucible knight
[6:02:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I think Woolie is jaut getting familiar with all the attacks and strings and timing
[6:02:11] <%CaptainBeird> eh he doesn't have to go to the castle weeping penisula is a possibility
[6:02:15] <%Anidem1714> just got done beating him, had to use parries, which, I m not a fan of
[6:02:17] <NBUsagi> He closes so damn quick
[6:02:19] <iacus_> what's different from the combat of other souls games is that it's less about finding openings and more about getting the crumple
[6:02:23] <rat__baby> these guys dont play around
[6:02:23] <+CrystalTree07> rolling into swing instead of into it
[6:02:36] <Uncle_Christian> I lost count of the times he said "Last try".
[6:02:38] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie knows he can do this off screen but he's having fun with this
[6:02:38] <moonbearbacon> I'm getting dizzy
[6:02:38] <+HairyWario> bloodhound is kinda the best skill for this guy
[6:02:38] <+Jessie_Lockhart> doodOne
[6:02:45] <Aussie_Manny> More training is required.
[6:02:45] <lbCyber> he takes out your stamina and you're done
[6:02:45] <emptyantics> He‚Äôs relentless in his pursuit
[6:02:48] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @iacus_ Whats the "crumple"?
[6:02:49] <user_naim> one more once more
[6:02:50] <Afroperonista> a test of your reflexes
[6:02:51] <primarch_lupercal> doodOne doodOne doodOne
[6:02:55] <+0neReeler> sekiro? don't remember but yeah very bloodorne like where you stay in and it is easier
[6:02:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @CaptainBeird fair, but that's also big content
[6:02:58] <+fizzguy47> they are pretty balanced relative to some of the shit in later game
[6:02:58] <Frazbeee> use the weapon art woolie
[6:03:01] <DelgotHansto> it hurts getting you having to get your souls which are right next to just one more attempt LUL
[6:03:06] <+pectusumbra> You just gotta play dirty more. use your stamina free slice spell. Summon. Use some items. You got options
[6:03:07] <Uncle_Christian> tomamoNoTalent -NO TALNET..
[6:03:08] <+JT_Jag> there are a bunch of evergaols around and Crucible Knight is arguably the hardest one you can encounter in the first few areas
[6:03:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Phase two = never stop
[6:03:12] <Frazbeee> AND BLOOD GREASE
[6:03:12] <+scarman125> this fight definitely feels great once you get into the flow of it.
[6:03:15] <+jaguarkek318> not even phase 2 fam
[6:03:25] <iacus_> @cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy breaking their posture/stance and getting a critical. usually signed by a yellow glowing spot in the enemy
[6:03:29] <Aussie_Manny> What're you doing? Get back, get back! M-Mr. Crucible Knight NOOOOOOO! chairNooooo
[6:03:32] <Dotados> This is not a try
[6:03:34] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Little to eager on the rolling lol
[6:03:37] <+Jiggisnipe> just one more time
[6:03:37] <huskarl_zap> kinda sound like crash bandicoot
[6:03:47] <DelgotHansto> DIDNT COUNT
[6:03:52] <Uncle_Christian> Woolie you rock because you tried.  <3
[6:03:55] <HystericalCH> what are we gonna do on the ground, oni-chan?
[6:03:55] <Uncle_Christian> OMG A PONY
[6:03:57] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @iacus_ I see. Thanks for clearing that up.
[6:03:58] <+scarman125> I'm sad that we probably won't see his reaction to phase 2 if he does this off screen.
[6:04:00] <+0neReeler> one boss to the next
[6:04:00] <%CaptainBeird> 10 more tries cmon woolie!
[6:04:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe you can befriend him
[6:04:09] <%Pillagius> @Frazbeee I'm pretty sure this one doesn't bleed. after a whole bunch of attacks and parries - never got him to...
[6:04:13] <RyuuAoi> ONE MORE, WOOLIE
[6:04:16] <+justianxix> this part of the LP is just gonna be named CRUSIBLE KNIGHT
[6:04:17] <lbCyber> respect
[6:04:19] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Good attempts Woolz. You‚Äôll get him next time. doodGood
[6:04:26] <zenith0111> Theres other map icons you can mark with
[6:04:27] <danknugglit> You can set a marker with square
[6:04:28] <%edgeroth> i had to just ditch my shield and do this fight because he breaks your guard open real quick
[6:04:33] <+jaguarkek318> yeah Crucible is right
[6:04:34] <+JT_Jag> If Shit Sucks, Hit Da Bricks
[6:04:36] <user_naim> you have those green markers too
[6:04:39] <RyuuAoi> Made respectable, Woolie
[6:04:42] <emptyantics> You‚Äôll get him Woolz x1dnslCheers
[6:04:44] <lbCyber> awooooo
[6:04:44] <RyuuAoi> Mad

[6:14:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah the arc is amazing for corridors
[6:14:06] <perfect_disaster> nice
[6:14:14] <+JT_Jag> honestly I think arc might do more damage for less MP than glintsword, even to a single target
[6:14:20] <lbCyber> it's super satisfying to take out groups with it
[6:14:22] <kazadaz> I'm like 30 hours in and I'm still wearing the same red+green armour
[6:14:26] <%CaptainBeird> arc is great for groups the penetration of it is awesome

[6:26:08] <stevenellis386> could've been a first try
[6:26:09] <Lazywabbit> Put this wooly ambitions to rest
[6:26:10] <kazadaz> Important FYI: the anti-Margit item only works in phase 1
[6:26:12] <%CaptainBeird> @shad0wtag i prefer Japanese version as ut fixes a few issues with the us version but i like the raw energy of the us version
[6:26:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Good run, but HELL YEAH POINTS
[6:26:13] <bleugh> foolish ambitions
[6:26:14] <+scarman125> yo I was sweating there for a second. almost lost my money
[6:26:17] <Savior127> Oh my that endurance!
[6:26:18] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> That was an INCREDIBLE first attempt!
[6:26:20] <perfect_disaster> I never use the item
[6:26:22] <+Aldra_E> This boss is a wall that makes people quit the game
[6:26:28] <user_naim> Got my cash in the end
[6:26:28] <Treasure_Vault> I think Woolie might have played a souls game before
[6:26:30] <iacus_> ez operation
[6:26:31] <+0neReeler> oh this LUL
[6:26:32] <Sparda_blizzard> Chackle + npc summon + 3 wolves
[6:26:33] <LaserRamon> Gonna get him this time
[6:26:34] <lbCyber> He's Capra demon
[6:26:34] <@Menitta> OH YEAH
[6:26:35] <CapCasual> Aurelia is itching to go.
[6:26:35] <+Aldra_E> Thats cheating
[6:26:36] <Aussie_Manny> Warrior blood must truly run in thy veins... Tarnished. wifiPathetic
[6:26:38] <+Peterbyte_> WAIT THAT WAS FIRST ATTEMPT?!
[6:26:38] <user_naim> Now will I take the same bet again
[6:26:38] <%Anidem1714> what talisman is he using i dont recognize it
[6:26:41] <SaiyanShoto> I forgot I bought the item LUL
[6:26:42] <yomario876> jelly
[6:26:45] <+RexSurname> its unlimited use Wollie
[6:26:47] <+0neReeler> get him dogs
[6:26:47] <batspiderfish> lateral sucker punch + hammer
[6:26:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> oh yeah that other item LUL
[6:26:50] <@Solidus_113> did you see the spells he had?
[6:26:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Jelly this time?
[6:26:56] <yomario876> jelly is tank
[6:26:56] <+orochiblood> shackle + rogier + wolves + u fell off+ ratio
[6:26:58] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> @peterbyte_ YEP
[6:26:58] <lbCyber> Rogier earned respect
[6:26:58] <+fizzguy47> woolie is the appropriate level for this fight
[6:26:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> time to bully the old man
[6:27:01] <%Shad0wTag> @CaptainBeird Nah man I feel you, very valid reasons! I prefer the US version cuz the lyrics are alot clearer if that makes sense
[6:27:02] <user_naim> second try debuff let‚Äôs go
[6:27:03] <+theoldone001> He's got like 1 or two attacks that are problematic but overall he seems straightforward. Good intro boss into the first legacy dungeon.
[6:27:04] <Omenaire_> i use a smaller bleed weapon in the left hand with the bloodhound sword, bleed builds up way faster
[6:27:05] <emptyantics> @orochiblood LUL LUL LUL
[6:27:06] <@Menitta> Oh yeah watch Rogier
[6:27:06] <%cubbywolf> I go for a walk and your here already?
[6:27:06] <+Peterbyte_> goddamn that was hype
[6:27:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jelly?
[6:27:10] <Gelphaze> Jelly fish is strong.
[6:27:15] <Uncle_Christian> WOLVES
[6:27:16] <iacus_> hes' too fast for jelly imo
[6:27:18] <+RexSurname> do it - cheese it all the way atpRtsd
[6:27:19] <emptyantics> Rogier is a real one
[6:27:23] <kazadaz> BTW summoning Rogier gives Marge x2 health I think
[6:27:25] <Uncle_Christian> lsmarkBark lsmarkBark lsmarkBark WE COMING
[6:27:27] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Les go! Round 2! FIGHT!
[6:27:30] <%Side_Character101> Jelly fish is super tanky though!
[6:27:37] <%cubbywolf> oh you're at Margit, I thought it was the end
[6:27:41] <emptyantics> HypeYum HypeYum HypeYum

[6:27:59] <@Menitta> careful of the chip
[6:27:59] <+Das_Prints> @iacus_ the jellyfish tanks better than the wolves. He can aoe down the wolves pretty quick sometimes.
[6:28:00] <depressioncherrie> the disrespect
[6:28:01] <Dopamien> that was dope
[6:28:02] <%cubbywolf> aaaaaaand dead

[6:28:51] <Aussie_Manny> Canadian blood must truly run in thy veins... Quebecer. wifiPathetic
[6:28:51] <%Reveresao> :)
[6:28:52] <+Vigonept> OH NOOOO
[6:28:54] <+JT_Jag> first phase only
[6:28:54] <%cubbywolf> look at all the buffs
[6:28:57] <+justianxix> LUL
[6:28:58] <%cubbywolf> too bad he can be 2 shot
[6:29:00] <PERCYMaybach> rogier went out like a chad
[6:29:02] <Uncle_Christian> not good
[6:29:04] <emptyantics> @aussie_manny LUL LUL LUL
[6:29:07] <yomario876> does not work on 2 stage
[6:29:10] <+HairyWario> shackles only work twice before big hammer phase
[6:29:11] <+RowenCleric> that scream hahaha
[6:29:11] <OrdinaryAverageGuys> I love that NPC don‚Äôt have to survive a fight to advance quests
[6:29:12] <+orochiblood> doesnt work on stage 2
[6:29:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jt_jag oh so it's worthless LUL
[6:29:15] <+sevorai> let him figure that out chat
[6:29:15] <SilverFaustX> i never found that shackle
[6:29:15] <+0neReeler> very disappointed i couldn't use it when he was jumping
[6:29:15] <+Aldra_E> Its only for first phase
[6:29:15] <huskarl_zap> the voice for the player is so lol
[6:29:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @Aussie_Manny LUL
[6:29:20] <+Zinri_Luck> phase 1 only i think
[6:29:21] <lbCyber> Only works on phase 1
[6:29:28] <%Reveresao> @WoolieVersus Shackle is 1st phase only
[6:29:29] <iacus_> ah i didn't know that. so it's not that ez mode
[6:29:32] <Dotados> wow, so it was trash all along
[6:29:34] <ramzyrizzles> Shackle only works at the start
[6:29:34] <perfect_disaster> it only works on phase 1?
[6:29:36] <user_naim> fucking patches
[6:29:41] <+Zinri_Luck> same thing happened to me
[6:29:42] <+Nero_Cross> @Th3SmartAlec I mean, it lets you pretty much skip phase 1 without summons or spirits taking damage
[6:29:44] <Gelphaze> first phase only
[6:29:45] <linSP> Scammed
[6:29:46] <%cubbywolf> lul damnit patches
[6:29:46] <+HairyWario> yep phase 1 and only 2 times
[6:29:47] <Uncle_Christian> Mar git
[6:29:48] <kazadaz> This isn't Outer Wilds, IMO it's fair to explain weird bullshit mechanics like the shackle
[6:29:50] <+JT_Jag> Using it phase 1 lets you conserve resources for phase 2 though
[6:29:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nero_cross true
[6:29:53] <+JT_Jag> not entirely useless
[6:29:55] <+Das_Prints> @dotados at the very least it keeps his summons a bit longer into phase 2.
[6:29:59] <perfect_disaster> I didnt know
[6:30:00] <%okuriskyles> I looked away, did he not use any summons?
[6:30:03] <+fizzguy47> he is parryable, too
[6:30:07] <+mechslayer71> every advantage and this is how we doin'? damn
[6:30:07] <%cubbywolf> all that help just for one punch
[6:30:08] <+JT_Jag> he used wolves. they're dead now
[6:30:10] <%cubbywolf> was it worth it?
[6:30:10] <+Vigonept> MY MONEY
[6:30:11] <+Rose_Silvers> he used but they all died
[6:30:11] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> That move with the double wielded holy greatswords was always what killed me
[6:30:12] <Wordless1412> does summoning reduce your overall dmg?
[6:30:14] <%okuriskyles> aww :(
[6:30:14] <bleugh> dam
[6:30:15] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @robertoszek
[6:30:15] <Aussie_Manny> This old man's stick is the most powerful old man stick ever.
[6:30:16] <yomario876> jellyfish is tank
[6:30:16] <+Figleafplays> F
[6:30:17] <Sparda_blizzard> lol
[6:30:18] <agustorm123> LETS GOO
[6:30:19] <%cubbywolf> my fight moneeeeeey
[6:30:20] <@Irridium> YEAH
[6:30:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I was sure
[6:30:22] <lbCyber> shackle + jelly is a good combo to whittle him down first phase
[6:30:23] <emptyantics> YEAHHH
[6:30:24] <%akajaybay> keeps the summons in play longer
[6:30:25] <%TheHateFish> Lets you utterly delete phase 1, though
[6:30:27] <perfect_disaster> thanks for the money
[6:30:28] <+justianxix> put those foolish ambitions to rest
[6:30:30] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It would at least let your summons last longer
[6:30:32] <@Irridium> thanks I needed some new shoes
[6:30:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> time for jelly?
[6:30:38] <yomario876> jelly
[6:30:38] <+Das_Prints> Keeps your summons alive for phase 2.
[6:30:38] <+HairyWario> jelly haha
[6:30:40] <user_naim> Knew it
[6:30:41] <agustorm123> Even with summons this is a test fight
[6:30:42] <%TheHateFish> Call 'em in immediately, they have no time and it lets phase 1 vanish
[6:30:49] <user_naim> Now try 3 or 4 might do it
[6:30:50] <%cubbywolf> its on your bar
[6:30:50] <+theoldone001> It really helps you get to phase basically
[6:30:54] <%Ashenik1> what lvl  woolie has?
[6:30:57] <%cubbywolf> boo-urns
[6:31:01] <+HairyWario> 36?
[6:31:02] <+theoldone001> jellyfish has a lot of health
[6:31:02] <KingOfTheGeats> I believe
[6:31:03] <%cubbywolf> it says 37 there
[6:31:05] <@Solidus_113> no faith in jelly FeelsBadMan
[6:31:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> damn the jellyfish hate smh
[6:31:12] <@Menitta> LUL now people going Yeah

[6:31:19] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Jelly is new. Soon Jelly will have a chance.
[6:31:20] <%cubbywolf> people hate jellyfish pfff
[6:31:21] <dralakbadusk> yo no dising the Jelly shes a real sister :c
[6:31:22] <iacus_> i didn't have the skeletons in this fight, but they could be useful since they come back
[6:31:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> muh gamba Kreygasm
[6:31:29] <+jaguarkek318> we stan Aurelia
[6:31:42] <OrdinaryAverageGuys> I wish woolie luck but I bet nah for that PAPER
[6:31:42] <lbCyber> anti-jelly bias
[6:31:45] <+Das_Prints> Jellyfish is quite good if the fight drags out if they get that poison proc. Jelly is no slouch.
[6:31:46] <%cubbywolf> go rogier
[6:31:53] <%cubbywolf> use your speels
[6:31:57] <agustorm123> Jelly was my friend this fight

[6:32:07] <+theoldone001> I missed summoning Rogier, didn't think he was this much of a badass wtf

[6:38:43] <perfect_disaster> it was fun guys
[6:38:51] <%cubbywolf> the starting boss of an area LUL
[6:38:52] <RyuuAoi> Good stream!
[6:38:54] <+Aldra_E> Hes the first boss and it makes most people quit the game
[6:39:05] <Aussie_Manny> Margret is the Papa G of this game, no?
[6:39:07] <+Amaideus> Took me like 23 hours to go find him, kek
[6:39:07] <+theoldone001> He's a gatekeeper, which is sad reading his lore later on.
[6:39:08] <viciousgrim> just to say. you can unlock the map without killing bosses.
[6:39:11] <@Solidus_113> imagine getting filtered by that Kappa
[6:39:11] <RyuuAoi> Thank you, NEW Super Beast Friends Play!
[6:39:13] <%CaptainBeird> i honestly expected margit at stormgate.
[6:39:15] <emptyantics> I saw Kirbo on the SS Ishimura
[6:39:29] <Blank9> faith is so much cooler
[6:39:29] <kazadaz> I chose faith randomly and it RULES
[6:39:30] <%cubbywolf> no faith only strength
[6:39:31] <emptyantics> @ryuuaoi :(
[6:39:39] <truegreed> Faith Int and Arcane have been just teasing so hard
[6:39:39] <Treasure_Vault> Faith is just a little front-loaded, it seems
[6:39:40] <+theoldone001> You put one toe into Sellia and left lol
[6:39:43] <RyuuAoi> @emptyantics I know....I KNOW
[6:39:44] <+Amaideus> Wait til you get more gravity magic
[6:39:45] <%CaptainBeird> be patient woolie, it's coming
[6:39:48] <+Amaideus> And sword magic
[6:39:50] <rat__baby> this game is so overwhelming at first as someone not already a lord at DS games
[6:39:55] <+HairyWario> granted if you go FAITH and INTELLIGENCE you can access the dragon and dark pyros
[6:39:55] <rat__baby> but defo worth the time
[6:39:57] <KingOfTheGeats> the next area you might like as an int character
[6:39:57] <+Amaideus> What a beautiful phrase, "sword magic"
[6:40:04] <emptyantics> Faith is so frontloaded
[6:40:10] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, when's Kirby?
[6:40:12] <%cubbywolf> i gotta go watch the evo see ya guys
[6:40:25] <%sherlockkat> crucible knight was my benchmark for how strong my build was getting. I killed him around level 50 but I came back to him at several points in the game.
[6:40:29] <kazadaz> Never too late to consider the good word of the Lord, or whatever it is we worship in eldenringland
[6:40:34] <+Peterbyte_> This game starts screaming at you to respec later on so nothing is permanent
