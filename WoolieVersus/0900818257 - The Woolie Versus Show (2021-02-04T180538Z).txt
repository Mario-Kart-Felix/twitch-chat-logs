[0:11:22] <%Livelinne> 2020Shhh 2020Shhh 2020Shhh 2020Shhh
[0:11:24] <+ekodrop> if it happens
[0:11:27] <%holydeviant1> It's Vanillaware! The artbook is almost as good as the game!
[0:11:29] <taken_lul> just got here whats he talking about?
[0:11:35] <%cvp5127> the doujins LUL
[0:11:41] <CappuccinoGuil> A man of quality!
[0:11:47] <%Livelinne> OhMyDog
[0:11:48] <%Lion_kun> Does the art book have more nudes?
[0:11:51] <+Tyonidus> What show are we talking about?
[0:12:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YO
[0:12:10] <taken_lul> oh
[0:12:13] <%Livelinne> shiaSing
[0:12:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it better
[0:12:37] <Belakitu> I gotta catch up, I'm on episode 5
[0:12:38] <%cvp5127> lol no it wont
[0:12:46] <Johannen> It will not catch on
[0:12:55] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm telling everyone who even thinks about buying this to get it
[0:12:58] <%ChoculaUltra> A Steam and Switch port would boost the game to insane heights
[0:13:02] <%holydeviant1> It's sitting on my PS4 menu right now
[0:13:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This is still a very niche game
[0:13:04] <%Seancicle> KPOPfan OSFrog
[0:13:05] <%Livelinne> have fun in pixiv shiaHypers
[0:13:10] <BlackermanZX> i hope it comes to pc someday
[0:13:10] <@Solidus_113> It's gotta go dirt cheap
[0:13:13] <%kewlmyc> I love it, but it's going to be niche as fuck forever
[0:13:23] <BlackermanZX> like its a crime its not in other platforms
[0:13:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Some of those missions would melt the Switch lol
[0:13:24] <%cvp5127> 300k worldwide
[0:13:26] <%holydeviant1> Just like Odin Sphere
[0:13:29] <Belakitu> Psychonauts
[0:13:31] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, for 13 Sentinels to catch on, the West has to overcome their views on Visual Novels
[0:13:33] <bacon_209> yyyeesss I've been so excited for this
[0:13:34] <%Zero_Jacks> Zero_Jacks subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! back in the lab again
[0:13:39] <%Irridium> some of the later missions cause the PS4 pro to chug lol
[0:13:43] <Johannen> Hades is on everything
[0:13:50] <%kewlmyc> Hades won shit tons of GOTY though
[0:13:56] <%ChoculaUltra> okay so maybe just a Steam port LUL
[0:13:57] <%cache_22> I hope that 13 Sentinels releases on more platforms. A game like that would really benefit from a wider playerbase.
[0:13:58] <%Valask> rah you're playing what used to be some seriously obscure PS3 jank
[0:14:03] <%holydeviant1> @Irridium missile rain spam lol
[0:14:11] <%hax_metatron> hax_metatron subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Do you think the Maiden in Black's Feet smell like fresh jasmine flowers, or wet overflowing trash on beach sand?
[0:14:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the final mission kept making my frames drop so much i thought that was part of the game and THAT was the plan LUL
[0:14:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I can't wait for 13 Sentinels to catch on and we get TERRIBLE Twitter takes
[0:14:25] <%ChoculaUltra> I noticed chugs but I was playing on the base PS4 so I chalked it up to that
[0:14:25] <%Valask> don't underestimate the cult following
[0:14:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cache_22 Honestly if it came to the Switch it would definitely pop off more
[0:14:32] <%JD_Lars> JD_Lars subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey Woolie. Did you hear about the bakery that burnt down? Their whole business went toast. Thank you, Money. woolieCHAN

[0:15:05] <Blank9> are you saying a longer one than death stranding?
[0:15:05] <Belakitu> Just y'all facecams? LUL
[0:15:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I really wanna watch the lp, but I also don't wanna because what if there's a pc release in 8 years? I don't want a repeat of how I spoiled P4 for myself...
[0:15:06] <%cvp5127> do each scene in order Kappa
[0:15:07] <BlackermanZX> Ugh... my head doodOuch
[0:15:12] <+Bigg_Tezz> is there a discord for this channel?
[0:15:27] <%ekodrop> pc is never gonna happen though
[0:15:29] <BigManLugan> just compile whenever Megumi shoots someone @woolieversus
[0:15:29] <%ChoculaUltra> the Best of Cut for the LP better have a mind break compilation
[0:15:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nope @Bigg_Tezz wollz stil uses typewriters
[0:15:35] <%ekodrop> don't think any of their games have come out on pc
[0:15:37] <brunoberserk> the LP is too powerful for a compilation
[0:15:38] <%holydeviant1> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ I'm working my way through P4 and loving it even tho I know The Big Spoiler
[0:15:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, what are the chances of a Darkest Dungeon 2 LP when it comes out?
[0:15:48] <%dreadedcthulhu> dragon's crown?
[0:15:56] <+Bigg_Tezz> 10 4
[0:15:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> I may have gotten spoiled by accidental art post and I'm kind of mad because I don't know if it's true or not and if may kill my interest of finishing the game
[0:16:00] <PrideOfFiddles> Aww VoteYea it's Reggie Time
[0:16:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> didn't that get ported?
[0:16:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @CappuccinoGuil Bruh do u know who youre asking? OF COURSE HE WILL LUL
[0:16:07] <%cvp5127> pc or switch ver
[0:16:09] <%Irridium> Dragon's Crown never came out on PC. Got a PS4 port though

[0:16:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Persona 5 isn't even on PC lol
[0:16:26] <%Javaa01> @Irridium But the PC just became a better PS3, so it balances out in the end
[0:16:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @holydeviant1 oh yeah it's still great, but that reveal will never hit which is a bit of a shame
[0:16:31] <bacon_209> is Renee going to all the souls borne?
[0:16:32] <d_man303> is this demon souls?
[0:16:35] <StencilOST> Odin sphere got a rerelease but no pc version, i dont think theres any hope for a 13 Centinels PC edition
[0:16:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cobalt_phoenix_ Honestly that's probably the best thing to do
[0:16:37] <bacon_209> yes
[0:16:43] <%dreadedcthulhu> @irridium wack, idk where I heard it
[0:16:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k don't know, man, DD is a massive grind and a lot of it boil down to just doing runs to level up characters. DD2 might hit the same stride

[0:40:11] <Johannen> @CappuccinoGuil That's 4-2...5-2 is a swamp
[0:40:12] <%Lion_kun> 4-2
[0:40:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> honestly Reggie isn't parrying a whole lot
[0:40:39] <%Lion_kun> I have more fun farming stingrays in 4-3
[0:40:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @Johannen right, I keep counting the broken archstone as the 4th area, every time
[0:40:41] <brunoberserk> BFS - Big Fucking Sword
[0:40:51] <dundore77> spear is good for 2-2 as well
[0:41:16] <X2Eliah> So, reggie is not going to do magic?
[0:41:17] <+discognition> If Reggie hasn't been parrying, Steel Shield
[0:41:18] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> scraping spear build? Kappa
[0:41:57] <%patriotrenegade> what rings u got bicth
[0:42:00] <Belakitu> Parryed if you will
[0:42:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> jesus take the fun route down why don't you lol
[0:42:13] <%Juriasu> sticky Kreygasm
[0:42:17] <%seniormeatbox> s t i c k y
[0:42:28] <Belakitu> Sticky lytCANDY
[0:42:33] <Storm_Samurai> This guy really likes ore
[0:42:35] <linSP> sticky CHUNKS
[0:42:36] <jackelzxaa> if reggie finds the dragon long sword i bet that becomes a weapon he wants to use
[0:42:36] <%kewlmyc> Upgrading in this game is so goddamn overly convoluted.
[0:42:58] <jackelzxaa> it's so good of a found weapon
[0:43:55] <Johannen> Would going normal upgrade path allow for more future branches?
[0:44:08] <+discognition> You can farm a second winged spear in 1-1 as well
[0:44:11] <jackelzxaa> has woolie explained that the downside to quality is it takes twice as many points to get anything good out of it?
[0:44:43] <%hax_metatron> When will they invent Soul-based credit cards?
[0:44:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:45:00] <@akuda_bar> @hax_metatron what happens when you're in soul debt
[0:45:09] <Belakitu> One sip of wine don't hurt nobody
[0:45:14] <%hax_metatron> @akuda_bar We'll find out in Elden Ring
[0:45:16] <+Grim1952> Hey, winged spear, nice
[0:45:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @akuda_bar your hair turns red
[0:45:38] <jackelzxaa> oh winged spear is good for this area. lots of boys vulnerable to pokie poke
[0:45:42] <jackelzxaa> good pick
[0:45:49] <X2Eliah> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ tru dat
[0:45:51] <Equirah> @akuda you go hollow
[0:46:05] <VoraciousKain> oh boy more reggie
[0:46:08] <Equirah> @akuda_bar you go hollow
[0:46:11] <BaslerJones> what happened to woolie's cam there for a second
[0:46:12] <linSP> bloooood
[0:46:23] <+discognition> Winged spear is the build I want to try when I get a PS5
[0:46:24] <+Grim1952> Trying out a lot of things is fun
[0:46:35] <penitentpendant> Souls = Time, they can be worked for
[0:46:38] <%TrafficCohen> You get the Soul Loan Sharks coming to break your Soul knees
[0:46:39] <roarofdamnation> Why are they still trying to go dex when Reggie said last episode he wanted to go magical?
[0:46:48] <%Lion_kun> Just farm world 2
[0:46:51] <X2Eliah> I think they forgot about magic
[0:46:52] <VoraciousKain> scraping spear
[0:46:54] <+Grim1952> 3-2 is fast 6000 souls anyways
[0:47:02] <+Grim1952> 4-2*
[0:47:28] <roarofdamnation> Did they really forgot about magic, or is it Woolie trying to push Reggie towards a dex built and away from the magic?
[0:47:39] <VoraciousKain> they forgot
[0:47:40] <%cache_22> Doesn't he have to attune the spell?
[0:47:41] <jackelzxaa> soul ray is the boss version
[0:47:50] <+Grim1952> Still not getting Freke's magics?
[0:47:56] <jackelzxaa> i think the spear is enchantable now
[0:48:01] <Belakitu> Have all of them as options, but not all at once
[0:48:14] <VoraciousKain> wasn't +6 to enchant weapons
[0:48:59] <OblivionSword1> good damage
[0:49:11] <%seniormeatbox> RIGHT
[0:49:12] <VoraciousKain> they're super weak to thrust attacks yeah
[0:49:12] <OblivionSword1> boom
[0:49:12] <%Lion_kun> weak to pierce
[0:49:12] <%seniormeatbox> OUT OF THE WAY
[0:49:16] <Belakitu> monkaS
[0:49:22] <%cache_22> woolieSMUG Woolie is enjoying this
[0:49:32] <knight_of_the_edge> get ready to run boi!!!
[0:49:39] <jackelzxaa> i hope reggie finds the cave of the
[0:49:42] <X2Eliah> Remember how the game just gave a free Fool's Idol to Reg?
[0:49:48] <+Grim1952> The other monsters in the area are weak to blunt though
[0:49:53] <+paladinstarbuster> it will be
[0:50:02] <%patriotrenegade> drop ur shield
[0:50:08] <%Terrarp> Spear is the way woolieSMUG
[0:50:14] <%Juriasu> two-hand though
[0:50:16] <MagicalBiscuit> do you guys watch the woolie versus anime Sub or dub
[0:50:27] <VoraciousKain> a pickaxe isn't an optimal weapon but boy will it hurt if you get hit with one
[0:50:30] <linSP> shield coward strats!
[0:50:30] <prime_name> I watch it in brail
[0:50:34] <+Mendin> big chonky
[0:50:34] <penitentpendant> Set the vertical alignment of your defensive device to horizontal
[0:50:38] <jackelzxaa> spear gets so much out of a big fat endurance bar
[0:50:44] <orochisdayoff> sound effect on that spear ]is so satisfying
[0:51:18] <jackelzxaa> 40 end in ds1 makes a tower shield + spear overpowered to the point where artorias and manus are trivial (the plague of gripes build)
[0:51:21] <%cache_22> Those workers are unionizing.
[0:51:28] <+Grim1952> Not fire lol
[0:51:28] <%kewlmyc> Ohh, they're doing this level. Boss fight is going to be fun.

[0:52:36] <VoraciousKain> spear is alright but ti depends on which one

[0:53:18] <roarofdamnation> I agree a different approach, a different weapon
[0:53:21] <Storm_Samurai> BONK
[0:53:23] <+paladinstarbuster> dont be a coward
[0:53:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie, this game does not expect you to suceed at anything the first time you try it.
[0:53:30] <+paladinstarbuster> you can do it reg
[0:53:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you were underestimating the MINECRAFT BOYS
[0:53:32] <VoraciousKain> do the lizards permanently disappear in this remake?
[0:53:35] <%cache_22> I don't think Reggie has even acknowledged the mine carts yet.
[0:53:44] <segychan> @WoolieVersus yo this stream layout is LIT
[0:53:58] <Storm_Samurai> LUL LUL LUL

[0:54:23] <Belakitu> The same 5 minutes many times over
[0:54:26] <%patriotrenegade> bop him with ur spear
[0:54:27] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> perhaps switching from magic falchion here ain't the business
[0:54:33] <X2Eliah> So why is he not stabbing for like 5 seconds?
[0:54:34] <MyNameIsRasus> BOW DOWN
[0:54:48] <VoraciousKain> nice
[0:54:57] <segychan> niiiiiiiiiice
[0:54:57] <Belakitu> Noice
[0:55:00] <X2Eliah> Hmm
[0:55:00] <%patriotrenegade> MUH DICK
[0:55:03] <orochisdayoff> YOOOOOO thats sick
[0:55:07] <rcand9> you can 2 hand after the parry
[0:55:11] <X2Eliah> Maybe Reggie wants to be a parry Boi
[0:55:12] <Belakitu> Love the parry animations
[0:55:23] <VoraciousKain> he will never be a parry boi
[0:55:24] <MadBaller123> man this game has many more tight corridors than the later souls
[0:55:27] <jackelzxaa> i think these guys are weaker to magic than fire, since they live in the fire zone
[0:55:32] <user_naim> Good Ol‚Äô Woolie Twohands
[0:55:48] <jackelzxaa> top tier stuck tech
[0:55:48] <AnneSQF> lame it out

[0:56:12] <MadBaller123> for some reason kiting always makes me think of DS2
[0:56:20] <X2Eliah> Imagine if he could accidentaly back into the respawned spider boss
[0:56:22] <MadBaller123> I think I kited half of the enemies in the late game
[0:56:23] <mr_killed_instantly> Toastyyyyyyyy
[0:56:37] <Equirah> it's also about the falchion
[0:56:40] <PrideOfFiddles> VoteYea Reggie it does work
[0:56:44] <penitentpendant> Parry practice in one on one
[0:56:45] <+paladinstarbuster> you have to hit them
[0:56:52] <jorniev> POKE
[0:56:57] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus if reggie needs to get to his first inventory slot quickly, you can hold down on the dpad like in
[0:57:03] <jackelzxaa> later games
[0:57:07] <jorniev> VLADISLAV THE POKER
[0:57:20] <penitentpendant> We've gone over blunt damage with SKELETON WARRIORS, has the value of pierce been explained?
[0:57:33] <VoraciousKain> yes
[0:57:48] <penitentpendant> k
[0:57:51] <VoraciousKain> but whether they listen is a different topic

[0:58:26] <Ninjalettuce> DO IT
[0:58:28] <Equirah> it's much too early for him to be trying to parry, he still doesn't have the basic feeling of the game down. walk before you run

[1:37:40] <Grev_stalmon> >Toothpick 2: Electric Boogaloo
[1:37:41] <%JobbedBone> do they accumulate respawns without limit or do you need to clear them out?

[1:43:16] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus best to not read outloud because he hasn't reached it yet, but something alot of people don't know with Patches...if you give him a hard time in dialog he bribes you. letting him off the hook like pat said to do back in the LP doesn't let you get the bribe items that he gives you in EVERY game.

[1:46:30] <resloxxx> a little piece of wood
[1:46:41] <jackelzxaa> man i hope bluepoint remakes dark1. they can stop there but dark 1 would really benefit from good graphics in the areas that have bad graphics
[1:46:44] <roarofdamnation> a magic sword would make this faster
[1:46:46] <+TopTieramisu> being able to send to storage in a level is such a game changer
[1:46:49] <user_naim> Man fuck these really good games
[1:46:55] <Belakitu> Theres a sound
[1:47:08] <whiteblacklight74> that pickaxe man got fucking exploded in the back and just kept mining
[1:47:15] <lotusdagoat> nah there's no need for ds1 remake
[1:47:23] <jackelzxaa> an enchanted spear would have two type advantages. if he swapped fireball for enchant weapon he'd lose a ranged option, but his spear would do poke and magic damage which this zone is especially weak to on both counts
[1:47:23] <lotusdagoat> its on every platform already
[1:47:26] <+TopTieramisu> ds1 remake? i'll take the bloodborne remake, thanks
[1:47:26] <X2Eliah> yeah ok

[1:47:47] <+Grayhammatter> expertly done
[1:47:48] <BlackermanZX> reg is speedrunning
[1:47:51] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> can we get a bloodborne that just runs at a stable 30
[1:47:57] <jackelzxaa> ds3 and bloodborne don't really need a remake tho
[1:47:58] <+TopTieramisu> @VoraciousKain lol just like the 6th archstone in this remake?

[1:48:55] <Equirah> @lotusdagoat everyone that doesn't know about the ini fix would agree LUL
[1:48:56] <+TopTieramisu> @VoraciousKain my point is this remake made absolutely no changes to the base game
[1:48:58] <jackelzxaa> a purple fairy with green wings appears above reggie's head and says "EVERY TIME!"
[1:49:06] <whiteblacklight74> GREED
[1:49:15] <lotusdagoat> @jackelzxaa yeah and even if bluepoint remakes it it'll still be left unfinished because theyre cowards and scared of making fans angry by changing anything
[1:49:19] <VoraciousKain> ahhhhh
[1:49:37] <penitentpendant> I forget, does two handing the spear give more range in this?
[1:49:42] <whiteblacklight74> eat your spices reginald
[1:49:47] <VoraciousKain> yeah having the actual 4th world would have been a game changer
[1:49:48] <whiteblacklight74> mem
[1:49:49] <jackelzxaa> @lotusdagoat i mean, if izalith looked good and crystal caves had better hitboxing on the invisible walkways it'd fix so much right there
[1:49:56] <PrideOfFiddles> VoteYea @penitentpendant It sure does :)
[1:50:00] <jackelzxaa> izalith with better graphics and better monster animations would make it not look embarassing
[1:50:01] <linSP> Reggie getting tub girled
[1:50:20] <whiteblacklight74> big quality
[1:50:21] <penitentpendant> @PrideOfFiddles Noted
[1:50:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> stabbing weapons aren't the greatest for the twinklies, but it's doable
[1:50:29] <+jiggy_snipe> yes fighting games
[1:50:29] <slix3431> Just hard kick
[1:50:30] <VoraciousKain> any effort would make izalith better
[1:50:35] <roarofdamnation> he should go and get the other lizards
[1:50:36] <slix3431> Hard kick forever
[1:50:36] <jackelzxaa> dark 3 graphicswise is still a good ps4 game, mind
[1:50:43] <jackelzxaa> it doesnt have anything that looks BAD.

[1:52:25] <whiteblacklight74> just pirate it
[1:52:34] <jackelzxaa> the big problem with ds3 is people don't realise is that endurance is a stat sink you don't ACTUALLY need, and that Vit is more important than just equip load

[1:52:35] <VoraciousKain> hate yourself more by buy us keys as well

[2:28:54] <+TopTieramisu> doing the forward moving backstep in ds1 was cool
[2:28:54] <+PulleylubeTW> backsteps will only come out if you dont use a directional input
[2:29:05] <%RaziWraith> with dark souls series "ghost" hit lag in pvp, it's hard to use backsteps effectively
[2:29:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @keiganofastora it's great with the Great Scythe in DS1

[2:32:04] <Fapbsi> i suddenly feel motivated, thank you
[2:32:17] <roarofdamnation> Yeah he should have gone to soul arrow an hour ago
[2:32:27] <seydaq> dual rapiers doodGood @lerouch_the_rebel
[2:32:31] <+PulleylubeTW> curved swords def take the best dps weapon type alot of the time for sure
[2:32:44] <+QueequegTheater> Curved. Swords.
[2:33:17] <+TopTieramisu> this is gonna be a loooooong level
[2:33:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> How close is he to THE CHAMP?
[2:33:42] <X2Eliah> Oh he saw the champ
[2:33:42] <+PulleylubeTW> pretty close baller
[2:33:48] <+PulleylubeTW> most of the level is looted
[2:33:50] <%RyTYoung> Soon.
[2:33:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cool
[2:33:56] <+PulleylubeTW> soon it will only be the champ
[2:34:01] <+TopTieramisu> @BallerSwagBro9k since he's taking the not-shortcut, a while
[2:34:02] <roarofdamnation> You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
[2:34:03] <VoraciousKain> tower of Latria be long
[2:34:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @roarofdamnation Haha thats for damn sure
[2:34:35] <whiteblacklight74> plus two
[2:34:45] <+QueequegTheater> THEY FLY NOW
[2:34:46] <penitentpendant> Correct choice
[2:34:53] <%RyTYoung> Soon as I found that short-cut I felt like I was actually playing a souls-game, except it's such a weird shortcut since there's nothing to unlock to use it
[2:35:17] <whiteblacklight74> do a haohmaru
[2:35:41] <jackelzxaa> I like how much easier it is to get pure white quests earlier in a zone, because when you have that done you can be human all you want in that level and use it like an ember in ds3
[2:35:44] <%RyTYoung> I don't think they ever attacked me when I played LUL
[2:35:45] <+QueequegTheater> He's just floating there. MENACINGLY
[2:35:49] <%RaziWraith> Everything that flies in this game gets stuck on stuff LUL
[2:35:58] <seydaq> would you prefer megaman bats @woolieversus
[2:36:04] <jackelzxaa> World 3 is the only one that doesnt let you get pure white early enough
[2:36:15] <%RyTYoung> @seydaq Yeah because they drop E tanks Kappa
[2:36:18] <+TopTieramisu> is demon's souls the only souls game that has enemies that truly fly and don't just fall to their deaths on a pit?
[2:36:21] <%Dapper_Cactuar> just because they can fly doesn't mean they aren't stupid
[2:36:23] <roarofdamnation> this is just animal bullying.
[2:36:24] <CalusRaccoon> I love the weird horse noises they make on death
[2:36:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now THIS is souls combat
[2:36:31] <+TopTieramisu> in*
[2:36:50] <seydaq> touche @rytyoung
[2:37:17] <OblivionSword1> FILTHY
[2:37:22] <slix3431> So dirty
[2:37:28] <whiteblacklight74> filthy mon
[2:37:37] <BerryliciousDefinition> Just a dirty boy
[2:37:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:37:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Everyone is Scottish in this game lol
[2:37:49] <%RyTYoung> You're too LATE
[2:37:49] <+QueequegTheater> Scirvir, the most trustworthy name I've ever heard KappaHD
[2:37:51] <mark_collins45> Kill him!
[2:37:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Been there lol
[2:38:04] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "oh... you already found it? Oh..."
[2:38:07] <penitentpendant> Hobo Vendor
[2:38:10] <+PulleylubeTW> scirvir and his quest for the dragon bone Kreygasm
[2:38:17] <slix3431> @A_German_spy Ty for explaining
[2:38:22] <%RyTYoung> @ballerswagbro9k Gotta represent that FREEDOM somehow
[2:38:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats right
[2:38:35] <%Frazzyfraznor> He's got some sweet mats
[2:38:37] <%A_German_spy> @slix3431 It's why I'm here
[2:38:44] <%A_German_spy> Well... one reason
[2:39:18] <Dannzzyy> I forgot he sold dragon stone
[2:39:24] <au_d3n> woolieLORE
[2:39:32] <au_d3n> Damnit Daniel!
[2:41:07] <+PulleylubeTW> if im not mistaken the shade upgrade path gives more magic reduction but lower guard strength
[2:41:17] <+PulleylubeTW> for any normal shield
[2:41:27] <%Javaa01> It has 4 less guard break but otherwise a raw upgrade
[2:41:41] <KellBeII> heater shield weighs less which is super important to some builds
[2:41:43] <+PulleylubeTW> "better"
[2:42:23] <%Frazzyfraznor> All the best shields are so fugly unfortunately
[2:42:46] <blastazoid00> Sandge
[2:42:53] <%patriotrenegade> hurty sand
[2:43:15] <+TopTieramisu> not too many attractive shields in this game
[2:43:50] <+PulleylubeTW> sounds like yall have high standards of shield beauty to me
[2:43:57] <roarofdamnation> You can beat the game with just that weapon
[2:44:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Immediately looks right
[2:44:19] <blastazoid00> Boom
[2:44:30] <+Stormzcales_Lair> is there a viable Crescent + another sword dual wield build ?
[2:44:59] <+TopTieramisu> dual wielding in demon's souls... hmmm
[2:45:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:45:11] <LunarRemix> I don't think so, duel wielding isn't really a thing outside DS2
[2:45:15] <+PulleylubeTW> duel weilding in this game with some weapon classes can be good, some even let you inifnite combo things, like duel katannas
[2:45:20] <LunarRemix> You can try it but it really doesn't do anything
[2:45:32] <seydaq> not bitch out, strategic flank
[2:46:14] <+paladinstarbuster> what happened to spear?
[2:46:43] <roarofdamnation> It was not magical
[2:46:52] <+paladinstarbuster> ahh
[2:46:56] <uncle_christian> Woolie n Reggie <3
[2:46:56] <+PulleylubeTW> yeah reggie switched off spear to fight the bugbears
[2:47:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Seriously, stop telling him to stop. Let him struggle and make mistakes and internalize them himself
[2:47:44] <VoraciousKain> never
[2:47:45] <+TopTieramisu> wog is necessary here
[2:47:53] <dundore77> so the spear is clearly the better way here
[2:47:58] <+PulleylubeTW> id ay woolie is balancing reggie learning things himself and keeping things going for the stream pretty well keigan
[2:48:02] <+PulleylubeTW> *say
[2:48:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh okay then
[2:48:15] <+paladinstarbuster> @KeiganOfAstora He probably wont
[2:48:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, this coaching is odd. I'm sure you get that
[2:48:23] <peachy996> It'll all play out
[2:48:32] <+PulleylubeTW> reggie needs the confidence coaching
[2:48:38] <peachy996> Everything will come up Reggarth
[2:48:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[2:48:50] <bacon_209> don't listen woolie!
[2:48:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> He'll fall off that cliff all he wants LUL
[2:48:57] <dundore77> he's doing fine. thats area where a few mistakes ruins the area since you can't redo lizards that often
[2:49:00] <LunarRemix> Yeah Woolie is doing fine as a coach.
[2:49:07] <mark_collins45> Reggie goes in blasting!
[2:49:08] <@akuda_bar> meanwhile reggie is ascending into the sun
[2:49:11] <%Juriasu> Reggie will keep moving forward until all his enemies are destroyed
[2:49:14] <slix3431> As a fellow stop and think person I feel Woolie's anxiety watching this
[2:49:15] <roarofdamnation> Except when you take his control to send his bombs away...
[2:49:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> "So I was glassin' and..."
[2:49:18] <+kevlarkoala> Reggie is DRIVEN. The path of a man moves ever forward!
[2:49:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie is apparently not worried about the unknown Kappa
[2:49:35] <mark_collins45> Reggie is like a shark, he can't stop moving or he will die.
[2:49:37] <bacon_209> Reggie is doing great
[2:49:40] <%cache_22> Woolie just needs a "Honk" like Pat and Paige. Or maybe that's a bad idea.
[2:49:42] <slix3431> Stop and think
[2:49:45] <uncle_christian> Just keep swimming
[2:49:52] <user_naim> Nobody bring up the Snailborne video for jokes
[2:50:01] <uncle_christian> woolieOMG_TK
[2:50:08] <bacon_209> it's like cookie monster, stop and think it through
[2:50:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> I got here late, did Reggie already beat a boss today?
[2:50:12] <seydaq> and welcome
[2:50:14] <@akuda_bar> reggie doesn't need help because he's clearly exerting solar power

[2:50:33] <+kevlarkoala> Stopping is too close to quitting in Reggie's heart. If his heart can not stop, how can he?
[2:50:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> "One Bloodborne, sir"
[2:50:34] <+Grayhammatter> fancy
[2:50:36] <bacon_209> I would love to see Reggie play bloodborne
[2:50:47] <whiteblacklight74> swinganda forever
[2:50:48] <bacon_209> all the back down
[2:50:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Snailsborne x100
[2:50:53] <+TopTieramisu> bloodborne is probably more reggie's speed
[2:50:53] <+kullumanati> Press F for Reggie

[2:51:03] <+TopTieramisu> plus it's fromsoft's magnum opus

[2:52:51] <%Pillagius> So... Deep in the rocky butthole, huh?
[2:52:55] <%baronblank> to be fair, a secret back entrance into a boss room doesn't sound impossible in a souls game, to me at least
[2:52:58] <@akuda_bar> could be demon.
[2:53:03] <whiteblacklight74> i know you can see me woolie talking about those pies you stole
[2:53:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Could be

[3:22:37] <+PulleylubeTW> honestly shoutouts to the name bugbear, what a good fantasy creature name
[3:22:59] <restingbones> It seems like a poke weapon might be very nice in these tight areas

[3:27:14] <whiteblacklight74> it has no scaling tho
[3:27:14] <penitentpendant> Megaman tool: Fire Sword!
[3:27:16] <pennykettle_> The fire sword in ds2 carried me through the game
[3:27:18] <Grev_stalmon> Nay, gotta be a BADGUY
[3:27:20] <MyNameIsRasus> News flash: A lot of things don't like fire
[3:27:28] <peachy996> Who doesn't like Fire? What's not to like???

[3:27:48] <+PulleylubeTW> world 5 gets aced by this thing
[3:27:51] <PrideOfFiddles> Use the dragon long sword to opress to poor of the valley
[3:28:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> it's a good moveset
[3:28:21] <mark_collins45> Fight fire with fire.
[3:28:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's the thing about this game. You find stuff in one world that's good somewhere else
[3:28:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo number go up? üëÄ üëÄ
[3:28:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> @mark_collins45 *insert metallica riff*

[3:29:11] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 29 minutes
[3:29:44] <ainda_> this area rules check out those vent feeder worms. souls ecology is good
[3:29:55] <seydaq> no better defence than not getting hit
[3:30:06] <$arcielardor> just got back from a bad allergy attack. did Reggie beat the dude?
[3:30:27] <VoraciousKain> no
[3:30:27] <dmtjinni> LUL
[3:30:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think pat tried it and the fire resistance wasn't that good
[3:30:28] <OblivionSword1> nope
[3:30:29] <whiteblacklight74> no
[3:30:30] <+PulleylubeTW> by dude i assume you mean the boss, and not yet if thats the case
[3:30:34] <user_naim> no second attempt at boss yet
[3:30:38] <roarofdamnation> he got a fire sword
[3:30:46] <roarofdamnation> and solved the tunels
[3:30:54] <%A_German_spy> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ It doesn't totally negate lava damage like you could in DS2, but it does slow it
[3:30:54] <VoraciousKain> reggie gets trolled webcomic
[3:31:00] <%Rajion_1> To get on that fire, you need that water shawl spell
[3:31:06] <+PulleylubeTW> and yeah KosOr, the flame ring barely makes a difference on its own
[3:31:40] <+PulleylubeTW> water veil is that beefy flame res you want for lava walking for sure
[3:31:41] <seydaq> homeward SeemsGood

[3:32:24] <jackelzxaa> reggie disrespecting foot waifu smdh
[3:32:26] <VoraciousKain> if you kill her your level up soul cost is reduced out of fear
[3:32:26] <whiteblacklight74> respect the waifu
[3:32:26] <+QueequegTheater> Hey, have we met golden boy yet
[3:32:31] <+TopTieramisu> how could reggie disprespect feet waifu?
[3:32:34] <$arcielardor> small feet
[3:32:34] <penitentpendant> Keepin' the home well lit. She's already barefoot, you want her pregnant too?
[3:32:36] <+TopTieramisu> disrespect*
[3:32:39] <+LordCasante> well we know what ending reggie is choosing...
[3:32:41] <%Frazzyfraznor> Wash those feet
[3:32:41] <roarofdamnation> At least call her waxy face so it sounds cuter
[3:32:49] <crimsonsaens> Did Woolie forget to point out she's barefoot?
[3:32:53] <whiteblacklight74> wax-chan
[3:33:15] <dmtjinni> same
[3:33:18] <+QueequegTheater> Zero the odd number
[3:33:20] <LordOfThePoultry> same
[3:33:20] <penitentpendant> Zero, the oddest number!
[3:33:26] <%ekodrop> god pat goblins
[3:33:26] <%Double_Tap_That> goblins
[3:33:26] <+RealPT1> reggie doesn't like getting soul levels
[3:33:30] <+PulleylubeTW> next spell slot unlocks at 14 int i think
[3:33:34] <+jiggy_snipe> what an odd goblin
[3:33:47] <+PulleylubeTW> 18 int for the 3rd
[3:33:51] <%cvp5127> yes
[3:33:52] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Might want to repair your stuff with whatever souls are left. Not just the weapons, but everything. Maybe also ditch the Greataxe if you're not using it since it weighs a ton.
[3:33:55] <%Juriasu> yeah...
[3:33:56] <penitentpendant> Easy divisors
[3:33:56] <roarofdamnation> If it ends in 0 is not an even number - Woolie
[3:33:56] <%ekodrop> woolie will never get to 99 str etc
[3:33:57] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Kinda
[3:33:59] <%Amaideus> Nah
[3:33:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> Yeah
[3:34:07] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin
[3:34:10] <brunoberserk> nah
[3:34:10] <dundore77> evens or 5 is the only acceptable numbers
[3:34:16] <+zaitje> nope
[3:34:17] <Aydarkzero> *sets at 17* huh what happened?
[3:34:20] <%Amaideus> I set it to the number it needs to be and ignore it otherwise
[3:34:23] <+jiggy_snipe> yea but I think people would prefer 0 or 5 and every other number is bad
[3:34:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it has to be either at 0 or 5 no inbetween
[3:34:27] <VoraciousKain> pocket sand
[3:34:31] <+Bucklord96> Awfully low on healing items üëÄ
[3:34:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:34:33] <Tuna_Can_0> idk I can only set my tv <10 because its loud as fuck
[3:35:04] <%Amaideus> What bothers me is when softcaps/hardcaps are numbers that aren't a multiple of 10 or something like 99(9999) etc
[3:35:07] <roarofdamnation> you lack the muscle
[3:35:19] <VoraciousKain> you need to chuckle
[3:35:33] <+QueequegTheater> why
[3:35:53] <OblivionSword1> you can but why tho
[3:36:10] <roarofdamnation> What happened to becoming a magical boye tho?
[3:36:24] <dundore77> if he's going quality i'd save those +0 (great) clubs for the one weapon
[3:36:38] <%Juriasu> woolieONEGUY ?
[3:36:42] <@Solidus_113> woolieONEGUY
[3:36:47] <+wolf34736> wolf34736 subscribed with Prime. 
[3:36:57] <Explodincatz> getting hit
[3:36:57] <LunarRemix> lol
[3:36:58] <%baka_sugoi> one magic GUY
[3:37:07] <scrublordsamurai> woolieSHOOK
[3:37:25] <Josef_Stryker> Did Reggie ever rematch Flamelurker or is he training?
[3:37:31] <LunarRemix> I bet that guy's a wizard
[3:37:32] <VoraciousKain> training
[3:37:36] <PrideOfFiddles> Only 1 attampt so far
[3:37:37] <+jiggy_snipe> training/exploring
[3:37:42] <%ekodrop> reggie looks like he's tired of woolie's voice
[3:37:44] <%A_German_spy> @Josef_Stryker This will be round 2
[3:37:45] <roarofdamnation> Hey man fire ball solves everything
[3:37:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> I missed the first two hours, has he been in 2-2 the entire stream?
[3:37:55] <VoraciousKain> its fine
[3:38:08] <%ekodrop> hoping he doesn't start crying
[3:38:12] <VoraciousKain> yes hes been here all of the time
[3:38:17] <Solidnick18> hitting things also works
[3:38:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Jeeeeez
[3:38:23] <VoraciousKain> its fine
[3:38:25] <%ekodrop> only 2 heals for lurker now
[3:38:41] <PrideOfFiddles> 2-2 is probably the largest level in the game :D
[3:39:06] <roarofdamnation> Yeah he is low on healing items, and he should change his equipment to max his fire resistance
[3:39:08] <%ekodrop> does he have the strength for the purple flame shield?
[3:39:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> I think 3-2 is largest
[3:39:11] <roarofdamnation> that shield is made wood
[3:39:11] <VoraciousKain> 3-2 is largest i think
[3:39:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> with the top and botom
[3:39:25] <VoraciousKain> unless you count the size of the swamp
[3:39:27] <%krispen_wa> what about 5-2's endless swamp
[3:39:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> oh yea
[3:39:53] <PrideOfFiddles> @KeiganOfAstora I hear ya. And i think you are right, but at the same time the bugs 2-2 are soooo tanky :)
[3:39:56] <VoraciousKain> idk about that shield
[3:40:00] <+PulleylubeTW> 5-2 might also take two streams tbh
[3:40:09] <+QueequegTheater> do a flip
[3:40:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Once you get the 2-2 shortcut you're fine. I believe he's trying it now
[3:40:28] <LunarRemix> Fall damage's so low on Demon's
[3:40:29] <%krispen_wa> I'm assuming he didnt kill Hot Ones man yet
[3:41:20] <roarofdamnation> nope he will go for his second attempt
[3:41:24] <uncle_christian> gentle commentary is getting to me.
[3:41:25] <+PulleylubeTW> dude just chillin pit
[3:41:44] <nailwind> Reggie lulling me with his sweet whispers

[3:41:50] <bacon_209> if he has the lizard with the axe it'll flip right?
[3:41:54] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Demon's Souls ASMR playthrough
[3:42:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> last drop
[3:42:36] <%RyTYoung> free souls!
[3:42:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> yu
[3:42:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> yup
[3:42:49] <PrideOfFiddles> +10 PogVhamp
[3:42:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> nope
[3:43:06] <+PulleylubeTW> there should be a rolling drop to that ledge
[3:43:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> The main way down is gravity
[3:43:20] <+PulleylubeTW> ^
[3:43:27] <roarofdamnation> ^
[3:43:33] <MyNameIsRasus> *Pucci intensifies*
[3:43:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> nice, one hit
[3:44:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can just run past them
[3:44:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Running away is not only an option, it is often the best option
[3:44:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> dang them some big ol bones
[3:44:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Good luck. You'll need it
[3:44:55] <%GingaNZ> GingaNZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Damn reggie is doing well on the demons souls, and cheers for playing it because lol at the idea of getting a PS5 in New Zealand
[3:45:02] <PrideOfFiddles> Good Luck Reggie, we believe in you!
[3:45:04] <+TreeeFOX> praying for you reggie
[3:45:14] <Aydarkzero> the runback
[3:45:15] <+PulleylubeTW> i bet reggie will beat flamelurker within 3 attempts at this point
[3:45:17] <pmda2126> let's go Reggarth
[3:45:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> back off
[3:45:28] <nailwind> thats some good ass dps
[3:45:30] <MyNameIsRasus> FLAME HARAMBE
[3:45:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> time for fire gorilla...so basically Sol Badguy

[3:45:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Use the shield too
[3:46:00] <Josef_Stryker> Honestly Reggie is doing pretty well
[3:46:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wow he staggers
[3:46:01] <+PulleylubeTW> flame ring will barely make a difference, maybe one more hit at certain hp levels
[3:46:06] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT ROLL THO
[3:46:06] <%Juriasu> KomodoHype
[3:46:09] <Belakitu> THAT ROLL
[3:46:11] <BerryliciousDefinition> NICE
[3:46:17] <%Lion_kun> Flamelurker and Maneater are the hardest walls in the game
[3:46:22] <roarofdamnation> all he is missing is more grass, and to equip his fire resistence ring and sets
[3:46:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> the item back there could be heals
[3:46:32] <MadBaller123> Did they keep the cheese pillar?
[3:46:38] <VoraciousKain> no
[3:46:42] <Josef_Stryker> Holy shit Reggie is doing it
[3:46:42] <%Juriasu> yeyeye fuck him up
[3:46:46] <%Amaideus> Honestly I find this fight to be way easier with unlocked sprinting instead of locked on rolling
[3:46:49] <MyNameIsRasus> THOSE ROLLS
[3:46:49] <uncle_christian> Did Anyone make a Hot joke?
[3:46:55] <whiteblacklight74> habben?

[3:48:24] <BerryliciousDefinition> Reggie know how to roll
[3:48:25] <pmda2126> did good
[3:48:25] <Explodincatz> Reggie just quit now your done
[3:48:25] <roarofdamnation> we can do it in 3, get those fire resistence set
[3:48:25] <%Frazzyfraznor> Nooooo
[3:48:26] <%Lion_kun> would have done it if he equipped mroe grass
[3:48:27] <%jonblnt> FANTASTIC
[3:48:28] <Afrosamasenpai> GANBATTE REGGIE! GANBATTE!
[3:48:28] <DonatelloJose> Run it back son!
[3:48:28] <Josef_Stryker> THIS IS ONE OF THE HARDEST BOSSES
[3:48:28] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT GUY IS SUPER HARD
[3:48:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Your roll timing was really good dude
[3:48:30] <peachy996> But the next shot will be great, just remember ring
[3:48:31] <Josef_Stryker> AND YOU ALMOST DID IT
[3:48:31] <mark_collins45> Scrublord Reginald
[3:48:36] <glass_marcus> Reggie to dude took me like 2 hours
[3:48:37] <+TreeeFOX> YUP
[3:48:40] <+eanscrale> This is like where people stop
[3:48:44] <Kohei_kyouji> people say hes the 2nd or 3rd hardest reggie
[3:48:44] <$arcielardor> Reggie is doing real good
[3:48:45] <%BisoromiBear> Flamefilter
[3:48:45] <MyNameIsRasus> If you do in 5 it's still impressive
[3:48:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19
[3:48:45] <%Frazzyfraznor> Good try man
[3:48:46] <MadBaller123> He's probably the fastest boss in the game
[3:48:46] <VoraciousKain> he was, looks easier now
[3:48:47] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I've seen people quit the game over this guy
[3:48:50] <%nintega010> Really he looks easy
[3:48:50] <%jonblnt> flame lurker downloaded Reggie
[3:48:51] <Johannen> Is it me or he seems easier than OG DeS? Less AoE combos?
[3:48:51] <+TreeeFOX> HARD YUP
[3:48:51] <%Rajion_1> Ok, but really, I couldn't beat him when i first played DES and had my friend beat him
[3:48:52] <DeathByPoke7> yeah
[3:48:53] <%Javaa01> Well, one of the harder ones to do legit, but also one of the easiest to break, because the AI blows
[3:48:54] <%ClericOfSparda> woolieCHAN psaDab woolieCHAN psaDab woolieCHAN psaDab woolieCHAN psaDab
[3:48:55] <%jonblnt> GG
[3:48:59] <Pnutz409> fking boss.
[3:48:59] <%Solid_Stro> The Flame Fucker Wall doodOK
[3:48:59] <%BinaryFireball> i did that shit with magic
[3:49:01] <shinichizio> thejewDab
[3:49:02] <pmda2126> no items really too, good job
[3:49:05] <+BinaryFireball> and a friend
[3:49:06] <nailwind> that was brilliant
[3:49:06] <uncle_christian> Reggie Soak in the love from Woolie.
[3:49:08] <Belakitu> LETS DO IT IN 3 REGGIE!
[3:49:09] <+QueequegTheater> REGGIE IS BASED AND FLAMEPILLED
[3:49:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gotta get heals tho
[3:49:10] <%ClericOfSparda> GG woolieCHAN psaDab woolieYE woolieCHAN psaDab woolieYE
[3:49:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Also maybe more grass
[3:49:11] <restingbones> Dont jinx it
[3:49:17] <Explodincatz> now that Reggie knows this hes gunna do worse very time now
[3:49:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if this is how reggie handles dodge rolling without shield use then the rest of the series should not pose too much threat
[3:49:24] <roarofdamnation> He should buy some grass tho, that's all he is missing
[3:49:27] <lukespencer98> @WoolieVersus Go buy heals maybe?
[3:49:29] <DonatelloJose> Positive reinforcement mode
[3:49:29] <PrideOfFiddles> Should we pick up some grass before Flamelurker? I mean not that he needs them anymore :D
[3:49:30] <MyNameIsRasus> If you do it in 3 it's still incredible
[3:49:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> You know what they say about third times and all that
[3:49:37] <%ekodrop> no health
[3:49:37] <resloxxx> It wasnt the greed that got him, he ran out of stamina just for a last hit or roll
[3:49:39] <nailwind> Reggarth achieves ultra instinct when 2-handin
[3:49:41] <glass_marcus> If he had like 2 more grass, that would it a wrap
[3:49:44] <Pnutz409> i wanna see him play bloodborne.
[3:49:51] <uncle_christian> Legendary
[3:49:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie is gonna crush BB beneath his fucking heels
[3:50:07] <+QueequegTheater> Reggie not using his shield means he learned how to dodge properly
[3:50:09] <%Juriasu> saying "not to jinx it" is always a big jinx
[3:50:09] <Explodincatz> @Pnutz409 that SHOULD be his next game
[3:50:10] <uncle_christian> With his pinky Toe
[3:50:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bloodborne next playthrough after DeS?
[3:50:13] <PrideOfFiddles> I bet the next time, Reggie can do it with only 1 healing item
[3:50:19] <+PulleylubeTW> some bosses get 200% more intimidating when they are at 1hp
[3:50:19] <%BisoromiBear> Yeah, BB would be a breeze with his playstyle
[3:50:20] <%ekodrop> staggers
[3:50:25] <pmda2126> aggressive
[3:50:26] <jackelzxaa> if reggie bought flash sweat (or the equivalent) and put on the flame ring this boss would be ez mode
[3:50:28] <%krispen_wa> reggie vs Paige in a "unexpectedly strong at Souls" battle
[3:50:32] <%Frazzyfraznor> Get grass
[3:50:38] <roarofdamnation> oh? is this happening? Flamelurker on 3, no grass, no fire res, magic sword only!? LETS GO!
[3:50:48] <glass_marcus> The first Blood Borne boss
[3:51:01] <+QueequegTheater> He is straight up a Bloodborne Boss
[3:51:16] <VoraciousKain> flamelurker?
[3:51:20] <+PulleylubeTW> yo this weapon slaps
[3:51:30] <MadBaller123> its one of the funnest melee fights when you get used to it
[3:51:31] <+Etherealizer> polearms are bestarms
[3:51:41] <roarofdamnation> The umbassa guys
[3:51:42] <jackelzxaa> reggie might be in a "that was the run and now i'm messing up" if unlucky
[3:51:46] <jackelzxaa> mirdan hammer is good
[3:51:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's Plagues waifu
[3:51:52] <jackelzxaa> i used it alot in DS1
[3:51:57] <jackelzxaa> it's plauge's fav yeah
[3:52:01] <Johannen> DS Glaive is Bae
[3:52:06] <resloxxx> Polearms three weapons in one
[3:52:08] <jackelzxaa> reggie is going to lose his mind when he gets to bloodborne
[3:52:13] <+Kev1n36> MH is a noob killer in pvp too
[3:52:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> Proto-Lucerne
[3:52:16] <jackelzxaa> also he might actaully be a DS3 stan because of the speed of that game
[3:52:21] <siamzero94> A lucerne from the mythical land of "Switzerland"
[3:52:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> whoa
[3:52:23] <roarofdamnation> Hard core
[3:52:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> no healing
[3:52:29] <+PulleylubeTW> no healing Kreygasm
[3:52:29] <+TreeeFOX> why?
[3:52:33] <jackelzxaa> i wonder if he ends up not liking ds2 as much? paige didnt like ds2 because of the speed
[3:52:34] <+PulleylubeTW> hell yes
[3:52:37] <BerryliciousDefinition> Theres no time
[3:52:45] <+PulleylubeTW> rip it up reggie
[3:52:45] <jackelzxaa> also because ds2 is the longest videogame
[3:52:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gotta remember to stay back and not attack every chance you get. Use some of that time to regen
[3:52:50] <MadBaller123> I almost couldn't beleive flamelurker had the same speed in the OG
[3:52:54] <jackelzxaa> ds2 is basically as long as the other games put together
[3:52:55] <%krispen_wa> tbf most people dont like ds2 because of the speed
[3:52:55] <Belakitu> Bloodborne-y
[3:52:57] <roarofdamnation> No healing, no fire res, magic sword only, 3 tries! LETS GO!!!
[3:53:03] <+Etherealizer> got the flame resist ring too if things get too hot
[3:53:25] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Amen!
[3:53:45] <roarofdamnation> I tell you that weapon is everything
[3:54:00] <roarofdamnation> So on that topic, about dat magic build...
[3:54:03] <%Amaideus> DS2 isn't even that much slower than DS1
[3:54:08] <Belakitu> Oh snap WITHOUT THE RING
[3:54:18] <dundore77> and if you suck like i did my first playthrough in the OG version you get frustrated by as many arrows you can carry and cheese it.
[3:54:21] <%Amaideus> It's the recovery on attacks and rolls being shifted that makes it feel weird
[3:54:40] <%krispen_wa> also ADP
[3:54:42] <peachy996> "I hate magic in my butthole" says Flame Lurker
[3:54:46] <nailwind> fuck having to level adp just to play the game
[3:54:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> is reggie is gonna just come in one day like "hey, I felt the itch and it needed scratching. I went through all of bloodborne"
[3:54:58] <nailwind> i finished 2 runs of that game before i realized u had to level adp
[3:54:59] <jackelzxaa> if reggie wants to bitch out he can just soul arrow flamelurker
[3:54:59] <%Amaideus> ADP sucks, but DS2 also showers you in souls
[3:55:00] <peachy996> Flame Lurker would NOT like a magical bidet
[3:55:10] <jackelzxaa> flamelurker does bad if you mage him
[3:55:12] <%Amaideus> So it balances itself out most of the time unless you're constantly losing your souls
[3:55:22] <jackelzxaa> gandalf has a type advantage against the balrog
[3:55:24] <%Amaideus> Also ADP isn't actually explained at all and the breakpoints make 0 sense
[3:55:35] <Explodincatz> crunch
[3:55:38] <jackelzxaa> adp basically you just want 105 agi
[3:55:38] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:55:38] <nailwind> slam
[3:55:39] <@Menitta> too much momentum
[3:55:40] <Belakitu> Cruncha
[3:55:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cronch
[3:55:42] <Solidnick18> nice rol
[3:55:42] <peachy996> OOF
[3:55:44] <%Amaideus> 105 is overkill
[3:55:45] <MadBaller123> oof
[3:55:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:55:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> g e o m e t r y
[3:55:46] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[3:55:46] <%ekodrop> yeah it's a bit harder to make that roll
[3:55:48] <%kewlmyc> CRUNCH
[3:55:51] <roarofdamnation> Oof
[3:55:51] <PrideOfFiddles> "Hello Gravity my old friend~"
[3:55:52] <jackelzxaa> about 30 adp if you don't want to think about it will put you at the required agility with almost any build
[3:55:56] <MadBaller123> its part of the souls experience
[3:55:56] <%Amaideus> 100 is equivalent to DS1 rolls
[3:56:02] <Johannen> Fat Minister drops grass
[3:56:03] <Belakitu> Could farm fat boi
[3:56:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> 99
[3:56:07] <%Amaideus> 105 is like 1i frame under ninja flips
[3:56:07] <+krispen_wa> ADP is dumb because it means you spend the entire early game leveling ADP and not the actual fun stats
[3:56:08] <peachy996> Fuck Flamelurker, The True Demon Souls boss to beat is Gravity
[3:56:26] <+Grayhammatter> the Fat evil
[3:56:35] <Belakitu> It would take time, but its free
[3:56:38] <VoraciousKain> the true boss is that one npc that kills npcs
[3:56:39] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus If you have consumable souls, the merchant in 3-1 sells Full Moon at a good price
[3:56:46] <%Amaideus> You can literally get the souls to get ADP to 100 (13i frames last I checked) off the first 2 bosses IIRC
[3:56:47] <%Frazzyfraznor> Did he beat tower knight yet?
[3:56:51] <jackelzxaa> because shields suck in ds3 you don't want to pump end like you do in other games, and you twohand so much that you only need 27 str. (and 27 vig is the soft cap on hp) people don't realise how much defense ds3 gives you for 30 or 50 vit tho
[3:56:54] <Solidnick18> the real boss is yourself
[3:56:55] <jackelzxaa> that stat never stops scaling
[3:56:57] <%Double_Tap_That> @Frazzyfraznor Yes
[3:56:58] <%Amaideus> And that'll still leave you with points to put elsewhere
[3:57:02] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Blige in 4-2 sells Late Moon for a good price too, and he's right near the entrance
[3:57:05] <jackelzxaa> vit is the only stat in the series with no soft or hard cap
[3:57:07] <%krispen_wa> yeah, but that infreases my soul memoru
[3:57:08] <PrideOfFiddles> Wait is Patches available yet?
[3:57:14] <%krispen_wa> increases my soul memoru
[3:57:14] <+QueequegTheater> WAIF
[3:57:17] <%krispen_wa> memory
[3:57:21] <%Amaideus> Your soul memory goes up anyway
[3:57:23] <jackelzxaa> and defense DOES matter but most people don't put more into vit than they need for thier equipload so they end up as glass cannons
[3:57:23] <+Grayhammatter> the waif
[3:57:37] <+LordCasante> mai waif
[3:57:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie hasn't even touched 4-2 yet?
[3:57:44] <%Rajion_1> no
[3:57:46] <%Amaideus> Where you invest the souls has no effect on what your SM is
[3:57:46] <%krispen_wa> Yeah, but what if you use that early SM for your good stats and not ADP
[3:57:50] <+QueequegTheater> no waifu, friend!
[3:57:53] <%Frazzyfraznor> Go backwards from tower knight for grass farm
[3:58:01] <%Amaideus> Depends on how well you can roll
[3:58:14] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:58:16] <%krispen_wa> ADP is dumb. no further discussion
[3:58:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> And if you'd rather use shields instead of rolling
[3:58:18] <%Amaideus> I made a twink in DS2, I'm well aware of how to min-max that shit
[3:58:44] <+QueequegTheater> ADP is dumb but it's also mitigated by how cheap levels are in DS2
[3:58:46] <%Amaideus> ADP is dumb yes, but the soul gain is increased enough compared to DS1 to compensate for the extra levels you "need" to invest
[3:58:51] <MadBaller123> what bugged me more was the hitboxes in DS2
[3:58:55] <%krispen_wa> imagine defending ADP
[3:59:01] <%Amaideus> Like the average endgame level in DS1 is 60
[3:59:04] <VoraciousKain> farming souls is best in 4-2
[3:59:04] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Dont use "twink" as a slur
[3:59:06] <+QueequegTheater> You can get to 60 before you're done with FoFG
[3:59:06] <%Amaideus> In DS2 it's like, 150
[3:59:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> DS1 is 80
[3:59:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> If you want to reach soft caps
[3:59:23] <%Amaideus> I didn't use Twink as a slur, i used it in the MMO usage
[3:59:32] <glass_marcus> ADP wouldn't be so bad if the game had a giant sign saying "pump adp first newbies"
[3:59:33] <%krispen_wa> HE DO IT
[3:59:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wow
[3:59:49] <%krispen_wa> ADP would be so bad if it didnt exist
[3:59:56] <glass_marcus> also tru
[4:00:06] <+QueequegTheater> But it's far from gamebreaking
[4:00:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I'm lost what's ADP
[4:00:10] <nailwind> i bet half the people that played ds2 finished it without knowing about adp
[4:00:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> adaptability or i-frames
[4:00:18] <VoraciousKain> correct
[4:00:18] <%Amaideus> I like detaching roll i-frames from roll%
[4:00:20] <nailwind> you just never know unless you read guides
[4:00:23] <%Amaideus> It's a good idea
[4:00:27] <+QueequegTheater> @cobalt_phoenix_ stat in DS2 that determines your dodge iframes
[4:00:27] <BearSawed> @glass_marcus yeah, but doesnt that kinda imply that everything would be better if it was gone?
[4:00:30] <MadBaller123> yup I finished ds2 with poison arrows
[4:00:30] <%krispen_wa> @cobalt_phoenix_ basically you have to level it to like 30 to get DS1 mid roll iframes
[4:00:31] <%Amaideus> But it's not signposted properly at all
[4:01:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh ok thanks, my only souldborne experience is bloodborne
[4:01:16] <+QueequegTheater> F
[4:01:20] <%krispen_wa> F
[4:01:20] <%Amaideus> It's like 20-25 levels investment depending on starting class
[4:01:21] <+PulleylubeTW> foolish ladder user
[4:01:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not gone forever like before tho
[4:01:34] <BearSawed> I mean signposting has always been hit and miss in souls
[4:01:37] <%krispen_wa> yeah, but imagine if you DIDNT have to invest levels into it
[4:01:49] <%Amaideus> Then you'd hit the softcaps about 20 levels sooner
[4:01:50] <@Menitta> That's my secret, Reggie
[4:01:53] <+Juriasu> don't worry about us Reggie
[4:01:54] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Round 3 let's go
[4:01:57] <nailwind> stay cool, reggie
[4:02:00] <MadBaller123> DS1 at least had the opposite brolem, an obviously useless stat
[4:02:03] <VoraciousKain> imagine if ds2 was good
[4:02:05] <BerryliciousDefinition> Good luck!
[4:02:06] <MadBaller123> problem*
[4:02:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> I was gonna say go human, just this once. The extra HP would help
[4:02:14] <%krispen_wa> and thats good since you get straight to the builds instead of doing filler levels
[4:02:14] <penitentpendant> Cry me a river Shinji
[4:02:18] <%Bluwizard21> flamelurker is a sekiro boss

[4:02:19] <+QueequegTheater> @VoraciousKain Don't have to, it is
[4:02:22] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus Reggie should bring firebombs to his next Flamelurker fight, I think it'll give him the edge he needs to win.
[4:02:25] <+Grayhammatter> nice damage
[4:02:28] <%Juriasu> flamelurker is shook look at those backdashes
[4:02:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> throwback!
[4:02:29] <%Amaideus> Man, remember when END+Vit was just one stat so it was an absolute god stat?
[4:02:29] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Return to Monke
[4:02:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> let's go reggie!
[4:02:32] <%Amaideus> Good design that
[4:02:41] <nailwind> i at first assumed adp was the same as ds1 useless stat
[4:02:49] <+Jaysky> Wait, the way we were talking before made me think Reggie had beaten this guy
[4:02:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:02:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> need heals
[4:02:54] <BerryliciousDefinition> F
[4:02:56] <%baka_sugoi> dang
[4:02:59] <%Lion_kun> reggie, get grass
[4:03:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> !grass
[4:03:01] <%krispen_wa> buy some heals
[4:03:02] <BearSawed> Man, remember when you just leveled at checkpoints?
[4:03:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> stall for time
[4:03:18] <BearSawed> bonfire chan best level up lady
[4:03:25] <peachy996> You will need to either not make mistakes or get grass, it's better you go get some grass
[4:03:36] <nailwind> @BearSawed dude, infuriates me. if you got a shit pc it meant you had to spend so much time loading just to level up
[4:03:44] <+QueequegTheater> BB>DS2>DS1>DeS>DS3, but Bonfire-chan >>>> all level-up waifus
[4:03:48] <dundore77> i enjoy reggies self imposed difficulties
[4:03:51] <jackelzxaa> i'm feeling like reggie would want to try without grass because of the thrill.
[4:03:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> No need to be a badass without heals. Go back to the Nexus and burn some soul items @WoolieVersus
[4:03:52] <uncle_christian> Woolie uses the bathroom,I assumed he was like Kim Jong Un?
[4:04:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So the Flame Resistance Ring will be most useful if you have heals. Without them, you're better off with Regenerator
[4:04:00] <%krispen_wa> imagine putting Maiden so low on the list
[4:04:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is he using the bathroom right now?
[4:04:08] <jackelzxaa> i kinda wish DS1 had level up waifus because it could add some interesting restrictions with how you get cut off from locations
[4:04:20] <%Amaideus> God no, that'd be awful
[4:04:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> True
[4:04:33] <Johannen> Would swaping out cling ring for fire res be better?
[4:04:35] <jackelzxaa> there are bonfire maidens in several parts of lordran so it could have worked alright
[4:04:35] <VoraciousKain> emerald harlod is the worst
[4:04:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> yes
[4:04:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wait, idk
[4:04:42] <%Amaideus> Adding in loadscreens and shit for leveling sucks ass
[4:04:47] <+PulleylubeTW> slinging souls left and right
[4:04:50] <+QueequegTheater> @VoraciousKain lies and slander
[4:04:53] <%krispen_wa> I wish Priscilla was the level up waifu like she was intended to be at first
[4:04:54] <%Amaideus> Especially when you can't warp
[4:04:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cling Ring seems better
[4:04:58] <peachy996> The Doll is high tier because Maria
[4:05:03] <VoraciousKain> its true
[4:05:07] <%Amaideus> So the doll is bottom tier
[4:05:07] <jackelzxaa> theres the firekeeper in anor londo, the fair lady in the demon ruins, anastasia in firelink, and they thought about making priscilla be the level up waifu of the painted world
[4:05:08] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Because with no heals, you'll be relying solely on passive regen to keep you alive, and the Ring of Flame Resistance won't block more damage than stacked regen will heal over time
[4:05:11] <BearSawed> @jackelzxaa You got 3 games with waifus, dont try and put them in the one that doesnt man. besides you still have the shrine maiden at firelink
[4:05:14] <pennykettle_> @BearSawed It makes a bit more sense lorewise in DeS. But man does warping back to your safe space hub in everything after DS1 kill the immersion. You never feel stuck in some scary place like Blighttown on your journey when you can literally teleport away whenever you want
[4:05:24] <KeiganOfAstora> Franz is so smart
[4:05:26] <%krispen_wa> imagine not wanting waifus
[4:05:30] <VoraciousKain> only one that doesn't revive
[4:05:42] <jackelzxaa> @BearSawed ds1 literally has the waifus, you pick one of the 3 to keep so you can get +6 estus before a newgameplus cycle, they just didnt get to do other stuff
[4:05:49] <VoraciousKain> well she "does" but you gotta pay to use her again
[4:05:50] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Nah. I'm just an idiot who learned the hard way.
[4:06:03] <jackelzxaa> I think restrictions can create more interesting gameplay and full freedom can sometimes lead to less variety because you always pick the easy way out
[4:06:03] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:06:03] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:06:06] <+QueequegTheater> I LIVED BITCH
[4:06:07] <nailwind> reggarth strats
[4:06:08] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[4:06:22] <%Amaideus> I agree @jackelzxaa but don't tie that shit to leveling up
[4:06:25] <jackelzxaa> DS1 having so many waifus would have made the level up waifu dynamic REALLY interesting
[4:06:26] <+QueequegTheater> ironmouseSHRUG
[4:06:31] <%Amaideus> It's not the fun kind of tedium or route planning
[4:06:33] <jackelzxaa> no tie it to leveling up because ds1 is so easy that you overlevel anywaysa
[4:06:33] <roarofdamnation> spicy drops
[4:06:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> But didn't you help write the guide for this?
[4:06:38] <%A_German_spy> @jackelzxaa That's why I'm a fan of SL1 runs
[4:06:43] <%krispen_wa> So you wanted a DS1 dating sim VN?
[4:07:00] <+QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa did you not? That's a dumb thing to ask
[4:07:02] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora Not for Demon's, no. There is no official guide for this game right now.
[4:07:07] <%Amaideus> Wasn't Priscilla gonna be the level up Waifu for DS1 at some point?
[4:07:11] <%krispen_wa> yes
[4:07:12] <+cherryceecee> @jackelzxaa i think demons is easier to break but yea
[4:07:16] <+PulleylubeTW> afaik spy worked on either the dks2 or the bb guide
[4:07:21] <jackelzxaa> @A_German_spy i've never done SL1 because i do like giving myself options and just making different decisions each time, but i do see the appeal, since it's what you do in megaman zero games to get S ranks
[4:07:22] <+PulleylubeTW> i forget which
[4:07:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Which brand guide did you help with for DS1? Prima?
[4:07:28] <%Amaideus> Hey @A_German_spy do you know if the DS1 remastered guide has maps in it?
[4:07:33] <%A_German_spy> @KeiganOfAstora I just have 5000+ hours logged in the original Demon's Souls
[4:07:34] <jackelzxaa> if you don't level up in Megaman Zero you can get the stronger forms of bosses easier
[4:07:35] <BearSawed> @jackelzxaa And I think you vastly underestimate the power of players to find the path of least resistance
[4:07:36] <%Amaideus> No one I ask ever seems to know
[4:07:41] <+QueequegTheater> Lucatiel > Solaire because she has a cool hat
[4:07:44] <+QueequegTheater> checkmate atheists
[4:07:52] <%RyTYoung> THIS IS THE ONE, I FEEL IT
[4:08:08] <%A_German_spy> @Amaideus All of Future Press' Souls guides have maps. We have a couple of dedicated team members who draw them by hand.
[4:08:11] <jackelzxaa> @BearSawed i mean, i am gonna prioritize my own ability because as i see it "if i learned it, all it takes is someone being taught" and then it just comes down to the base mechanic itself
[4:08:15] <+Bucklord96> How many attempts we at?
[4:08:18] <roarofdamnation> Yeah yeah 4th try is the on-
[4:08:18] <%krispen_wa> Vileblood Queen has a cute mask. checkmate flat earthers
[4:08:21] <%Amaideus> Sick, thanks a ton
[4:08:22] <%Frazzyfraznor> I have the des collectors edition with a small guide
[4:08:23] <%RyTYoung> I spoke too soon NotLikeThis
[4:08:26] <BerryliciousDefinition> F
[4:08:26] <BlackermanZX> ouch
[4:08:27] <%baka_sugoi> AOE
[4:08:28] <Aydarkzero> haha
[4:08:31] <%krispen_wa> F
[4:08:36] <+PulleylubeTW> time for regression before the progression
[4:08:39] <jackelzxaa> because ds1 doesn't have bonfire warping a level up restriction could do a ton for the tone of that adventure
[4:08:40] <+QueequegTheater> roll as the arm comes across the torso
[4:08:42] <brianthe12th> did someone say ground pound
[4:08:48] <jackelzxaa> *doesn't have warping for the first half
[4:08:51] <%krispen_wa> Gacha timing u say?
[4:08:58] <%A_German_spy> @Amaideus No problem
[4:09:22] <%krispen_wa> throw Reggie into the FGO pits
[4:09:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the polar opposite of pat

[4:09:57] <+jiggy_snipe> lul
[4:10:02] <BearSawed> @jackelzxaa I dont understand what youre saying there. Like I dont see the connection you seem to be drawing
[4:10:21] <+QueequegTheater> I can kill Birkin with this knife for sure
[4:10:24] <BlackermanZX> well people do knife only runs doodDerp
[4:10:31] <dundore77> thats why silent hill has a trick where if you go to the final boss without bullets the boss just dies because it knows you can't win.

[4:10:43] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[4:10:49] <jackelzxaa> @BearSawed because you would have to walk over to the level up person out in the world in DS1, instead of warping back to the hub, it would add a huge mechanical aspect to leveling up that would give people a ton of really useful anxiety
[4:10:50] <%cvp5127> peace
[4:10:51] <%BisoromiBear> F
[4:10:52] <%RyTYoung> WAIT WHAT
[4:10:54] <peachy996> Time to deal with the Chimera Hallways with a Knife
[4:10:57] <%krispen_wa> @dundore77 and it's the canon end too
[4:10:59] <BlackermanZX> well that was easy
[4:11:04] <jackelzxaa> and then when you find a new level up waifu it'd be like finding an angel on earth
[4:11:05] <%Juriasu> alright this is the run
[4:11:08] <%baka_sugoi> reggie stinky
[4:11:23] <roarofdamnation> Alright 5th one is THE ONE! LETS GO!!!
[4:11:32] <+Grayhammatter> every time? every time
[4:11:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> wokeED
[4:11:39] <Josef_Stryker> There's nothing more shitty than having one *really* good attempt and then later attempts make you look like crap
[4:11:42] <%Juriasu> every time?
[4:11:42] <%krispen_wa> the AoE on that is way more visible in the original
[4:11:44] <nailwind> REEgie, get it boy
[4:11:49] <Josef_Stryker> Every time
[4:11:55] <%RyTYoung> QUICK MESSAGE READ

[4:12:03] <%krispen_wa> umbasa
[4:12:03] <+QueequegTheater> Man that makes me think of a SoulsBorne fighting game
[4:12:03] <roarofdamnation> maybe not
[4:12:06] <LordOfThePoultry> umbasa
[4:12:08] <%A_German_spy> Good ol' Fromsoft camera
[4:12:10] <jackelzxaa> man that first run was the best run
[4:12:14] <+QueequegTheater> I would probably main Lucatiel
[4:12:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Like a Titan
[4:12:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> nape of the neck
[4:12:23] <nailwind> Reggies getting the worst treatment, prodigy start into depression with the strongest boss
[4:12:26] <peachy996> Oh yeah don't fall into that mindset: where you almost beat it first/second try but now it's starting to eat at you
[4:12:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> got killed so good the screen turned monochrome
[4:12:34] <BearSawed> @jackelzxaa Ima say that maybe youre tastes arent indicative of the majority of players, but hey man You can play that way if you want I guess
[4:12:36] <jackelzxaa> Reggie might need to buy some firebombs for this one, i think there's no other way
[4:12:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> @jackelzxaa LUL
[4:13:13] <jackelzxaa> @bearsawed no one is going to opt into making the game more difficult, even if they would enjoy that other version of the game more if it was what they had. that's why you never let your game testers offer design ideas, you just study their habits and reactions
[4:13:18] <%JD_Lars> Did they left curfew in Montreal?
[4:13:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait you mean i'm NOT supposed to be mad at myself for being able to almost do it once then not get anywhere close to that point after 5 tries?
[4:13:22] <+PulleylubeTW> ad payed for by firebomb squad
[4:13:25] <+QueequegTheater> Man I can't wait for Reggie VS BB so we can see Woolie get salty as Reggie skullfucks that game
[4:13:25] <%JD_Lars> Lift*
[4:13:45] <%krispen_wa> Reggie vs BB-Chan
[4:13:52] <+jiggy_snipe> is Reggie still wearing the flame resist ring?
[4:13:59] <nailwind> be positive, if you did it once you can do it again
[4:14:00] <peachy996> You're allowed but it's totally something that screws with you every attemp onwards
[4:14:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @krispen_wa I understood that reference
[4:14:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's a nice circle
[4:14:33] <+Jaysky> I too enjoy circles
[4:14:36] <+QueequegTheater> This would be a dope Soul Calibur stage
[4:14:46] <+Grayhammatter> love that circle, it's a nice circle
[4:14:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> back off
[4:14:53] <+QueequegTheater> Commence cowarding out
[4:14:56] <Augus7717> is it just me or is the bgm fucked?
[4:15:04] <nailwind> Alright, we got patience
[4:15:09] <%baka_sugoi> F O O T S I E S
[4:15:13] <BearSawed> @jackelzxaa Maybe you wanna ask Agermanspy about challenge runs of DeS. People do opt to make things more difficult, its just that they are a small %, I dont know man. I just wish DS1 was better optimized
[4:15:23] <VoraciousKain> fucked in what way
[4:15:25] <%RyTYoung> @queequegtheater I thought you meant BB from Death Stranding I was like "WHY?!"
[4:15:35] <+QueequegTheater> @RyTYoung KappaHD
[4:15:46] <+QueequegTheater> EXTREME GREED
[4:15:47] <+Grayhammatter> the greed
[4:15:53] <peachy996> Bruh go get some grass
[4:15:54] <Augus7717> like the orchestra
[4:15:58] <Augus7717> only half it it is audible
[4:16:02] <Augus7717> and out of tune too
[4:16:11] <roarofdamnation> Maybe more cheese around the pillars when waiting out the regen
[4:16:15] <jackelzxaa> @BearSawed i meant on average. most players will want the "i want it to be easier for me" option, without realising what that could trade
[4:16:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> Please get some grass
[4:16:18] <OblivionSword1> gotta play that footies
[4:16:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's really bad
[4:16:23] <%krispen_wa> krispen_wa subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Heed my words, Reggarth. If thou wishest to win, thou must gather thy courage and doeth combo...eth
[4:16:31] <dundore77> gotta the respect the no bitch in his heart
[4:16:43] <jackelzxaa> if bonfire leveling never existed it wouldn't be something that would occur to players to suggest
[4:16:54] <jackelzxaa> theyd think "oh you need the special person to level up because that makes sense for the story and mechanics"
[4:16:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1356481946692558849?s=19

[4:18:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus It sounds like a long time in a boss fight, but 30 seconds is all you need to get most if not all of your health back
[4:18:22] <+jiggy_snipe> ok
[4:18:27] <jackelzxaa> when flamelurker staggers, it might be the time to use R2
[4:18:30] <BlackermanZX> damn countered
[4:18:34] <nailwind> the paw swipe
[4:18:35] <jackelzxaa> that, or firebombs
[4:18:38] <%nintega010> You're playing Maxs hard mode

[4:19:21] <DeathByPoke7> dat boi
[4:19:22] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This grass is overpriced, from Patches

[4:19:40] <%RyTYoung> The biggest of Hustle Lords
[4:19:43] <jackelzxaa> they can stop at DS1 but a DS1 bluepoint would be so killer
[4:19:45] <Josef_Stryker> I didn't even know he met Patches
[4:19:45] <+hukurowl> man it's a hell of a thing to finally see Patches' face move after all this time
[4:19:54] <jackelzxaa> imagine if lost izalith was the most beautiful location in the game
[4:19:56] <+Jaysky> I'm proud of him :)
[4:19:57] <jackelzxaa> what world that would be
[4:19:59] <Khotgor> Patches the Hyena huh? I bet he has a raunchy tomboy as an Ex
[4:20:01] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:20:01] <%krispen_wa> DAMN CLERICS

[4:20:18] <drk_sd> vs god
[4:20:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> heh, even here he shittalks everyone in the area
[4:20:19] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:20:21] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[4:20:21] <jackelzxaa> it gives me anxiety that reggie doesn't put his weapon away in the hub because i always do that or i two hand something that can't attack for shit

[4:20:36] <%ekodrop> easy there woolie
[4:20:39] <au_d3n> He slapped his sister
[4:20:40] <%Chatterbox1991> i wonder why
[4:20:42] <+Grayhammatter> overpriced as heck
[4:20:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Like my high school dealer LUL
[4:20:44] <roarofdamnation> He is preaching it, wait...
[4:20:45] <Cykron> Reggie
[4:20:46] <jackelzxaa> i almost used wrath of gods on my umbral ash lady in DS3 in my last run but i just barely walked away from her
[4:20:47] <+Etherealizer> he's got that dank
[4:20:49] <jackelzxaa> it woulda been a bad time
[4:20:50] <%FrostedZaibatsu> FUCK Patches. Kill that bitch on sight
[4:20:50] <uncle_christian> yolo
[4:20:52] <OblivionSword1> this is highway robbery price
[4:20:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Gotta get a better grass dealer dudes
[4:21:03] <jackelzxaa> don't hurt patches
[4:21:12] <Cykron> HE'S SHORTING YOU
[4:21:12] <jackelzxaa> be harsh on patches so he BRIBES you
[4:21:14] <Josef_Stryker> When did Reggie meet Patches?
[4:21:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> I never used those ever
[4:21:24] <jackelzxaa> tell him you dont forgive him in every game and he gifts you rare items
[4:21:27] <Josef_Stryker> Did I miss a stream?
[4:21:30] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Wait, these prices are lower than in the original
[4:21:31] <+jiggy_snipe> @Josef_Stryker earlier in stream, he blew him up too Kappa
[4:21:34] <%ekodrop> he has 5 it's fine
[4:21:40] <%ekodrop> err 4 now
[4:21:40] <%Frazzyfraznor> I only would put away firestorm so i didnt kill anyone
[4:21:42] <jackelzxaa> pat thinks youre supposed to forgive patches but that is actually the worse choice
[4:21:53] <jackelzxaa> you get forgiveness after the bribe anyways
[4:21:54] <%FrostedZaibatsu> @jackelzxaa Ill stick a claymoredown his throat everytime
[4:22:04] <jackelzxaa> you lose so much by hurting patches
[4:22:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus They lowered Patches' prices in the remake. Full Moon at 1000 is what you'd get from Waifu.
[4:22:08] <jackelzxaa> he's useful in every game
[4:22:29] <OblivionSword1> is it full white ?
[4:22:37] <jackelzxaa> fuck yeah the executioners grounds
[4:22:39] <peachy996> I don't even remember if he drops anything usefull if you kill him in BB
[4:22:43] <jackelzxaa> i dont know if miralda will be there yet
[4:22:44] <Equirah> @OblivionSword1 no
[4:22:50] <%ekodrop> he's not pure white though
[4:22:51] <jackelzxaa> miralda doesn't talk unless youre human, unfortunately
[4:22:53] <peachy996> I know he goes nuts if you use the Rosmarinus on him
[4:22:59] <jackelzxaa> you dont need pure white to get through the gate
[4:23:03] <+Jaysky> His shop is a bit patchy
[4:23:04] <%ekodrop> oh he is
[4:23:12] <jackelzxaa> the ladder in world 5 and the gate in world 1 open before the npc quest becomes available
[4:23:28] <jackelzxaa> sadly the same doesn't happen in world 3
[4:23:34] <%Amaideus> Cov-itch-is returns from its many year slumber!
[4:23:35] <+Grayhammatter> quickly, to BOLETARIA
[4:23:41] <brunoberserk> reggie already killed flamelurker ?
[4:23:44] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[4:23:50] <%Amaideus> I remember that debate in the DS2 LP, man that was a good LP
[4:23:56] <jackelzxaa> you have to either play online or beat maneaters to get the world 3 white quest
[4:23:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:23:57] <%Frazzyfraznor> Farm backwards from tower knight
[4:24:12] <jackelzxaa> @woolie if reggie kills the red dragon it'll open the gate, but he would need to load up on poison arrows
[4:24:13] <%ekodrop> no need to worry about the world tendency reset
[4:24:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> waif
[4:24:30] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus it takes 3.....
[4:24:32] <+Grayhammatter> the waif
[4:24:36] <jackelzxaa> @woolieversus if reggie kills the red dragon it'll open the gate, but he would need to load up on poison arrows and that'd take a while so it might not be good to do now
[4:24:41] <Khotgor> Did you know that Strength is superior to Dex, due to Strength being the chad way?
[4:24:43] <OblivionSword1> no waif friends
[4:25:16] <%Lion_kun> why is reggie cowarding out
[4:25:27] <%Lion_kun> he almost beat flamelurker
[4:25:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> That 1-1 gate was open when Reggie beat Phalanx
[4:25:37] <%BisoromiBear> real sigma males choose dex
[4:25:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Patches' prices seem to have been lowered in the remake. You can just buy from him from now on, I guess
[4:25:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's not cowarding out, he's going to a merchant for grass
[4:25:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's buyin grass right?
[4:25:49] <%Amaideus> Real sigmas choose Hex
[4:25:51] <%Amaideus> :^)
[4:25:52] <OblivionSword1> @Lion_kun grass
[4:25:55] <%Lion_kun> ah sorry
[4:26:02] <Khotgor> Real Omegas choose Strength
[4:26:06] <%Lion_kun> I saw him in 3-1 and thougt he gave up
[4:26:08] <Khotgor> The ender of all enders
[4:26:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you not have audio?
[4:26:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> imagine not going full luck
[4:26:25] <%Lion_kun> if he wants to farm grass, 1-2 is better
[4:26:31] <%Lion_kun> I was away from the PC
[4:26:31] <%Amaideus> Real Kappa's chose Faith :^)
[4:26:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's not farming, he's buying
[4:26:36] <+jiggy_snipe> not farm, buy
[4:26:38] <jackelzxaa> reggie loses alot of damage because he keeps doing the step back move, unless he's intending to do it to get away from the enemy.
[4:26:41] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus She's on this level
[4:27:05] <%Lion_kun> Best place for souls would be beginning of 4-2
[4:27:08] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Right near where you killed the Mindflayer
[4:27:18] <Equirah> @jackelzxaa he does not and wastes stamina too
[4:27:23] <jackelzxaa> he hasn't started 4-2 yet so that'd be like starting a new zone
[4:27:41] <Darren716> He beat flame lurker?
[4:27:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> Patches was 5000

[4:28:39] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Gonna need to pop some consumables, though. And I'm not sure you caught it, but it looks like Patches' prices were reduced in the remake. He used to overcharge for stuff. I guess you can buy stuff from him from now on, I guess.

[4:33:30] <%LordSDB> Nice Reggie, getting real smooth woolieCHAN
[4:33:30] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus if Reggie gets a pure white world quest out of the way, he can start using THAT world to suicide in, instead of the nexus, to start getting it ready for the pure black world quest
[4:33:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> You guys need to pay attention lol
[4:33:49] <+Rafraud> I was getting a drink lol
[4:34:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @jackelzxaa this boi playing 5D chess with his world tendency

[4:34:47] <+jiggy_snipe> I was hoping he would just go in and beat it lol
[4:34:48] <peachy996> Give the ginger the fire ring, great idea Gaia
[4:34:48] <OblivionSword1> reggie why
[4:34:50] <jackelzxaa> if youre big pro you can use pure black quests at the right moment in progression to push you to white world later and have a harder stage
[4:34:53] <%Frazzyfraznor> Oh oh
[4:34:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gremlins intensify
[4:35:12] <Josef_Stryker> FUCK HIM UP
[4:35:14] <jackelzxaa> reggie doesn't have his regen shield up
[4:35:15] <+PulleylubeTW> soul arrow works for a while
[4:35:20] <+PulleylubeTW> but he will chase
[4:35:22] <+MisleadingEchoes> "It is a different fight, but it is a fight" Poetry

[4:35:25] <OblivionSword1> THE BALLS
[4:35:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> shield
[4:35:34] <+Grayhammatter> also shield
[4:35:41] <slix3431> Look at that demon gate!
[4:35:45] <roarofdamnation> The disrespect
[4:35:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> how?
[4:35:54] <jackelzxaa> imagine how much more vicious this fight could have been
[4:35:55] <nailwind> what a roll
[4:35:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[4:35:57] <+Grayhammatter> WHOA
[4:36:02] <Tooniearcade> Come on reggie
[4:36:03] <roarofdamnation> I believe tho the luck is with him
[4:36:08] <roarofdamnation> and luck is a skill
[4:36:18] <roarofdamnation> BIRD GANG
[4:36:30] <+Rafraud> This how I did the fight its a valid strat switching between both
[4:36:33] <%Irridium> PogChamp
[4:36:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> He doesn't necessarily have to two-hand
[4:36:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's taking too much concentration and one-handed is still damage
[4:37:02] <+alphonseisbest> is two hand, riggie's drop ur shield
[4:37:04] <+jiggy_snipe> sword is good
[4:37:10] <%RyTYoung> birb
[4:37:16] <slix3431> woolieSMUG
[4:37:17] <jackelzxaa> that was some wasted grass....
[4:37:18] <+Grayhammatter> oof, nice try though
[4:37:19] <+Rafraud> Wand gang
[4:37:19] <roarofdamnation> ok but he has the idea
[4:37:23] <Rixstarian> Respect the arena, Reggie
[4:37:28] <Tooniearcade> brysuSwet
[4:37:32] <jackelzxaa> he's face fucking him
[4:37:38] <roarofdamnation> the pillars are fucking him tho
[4:37:46] <jackelzxaa> flamelurker is vulnerable from behind
[4:37:52] <+Rafraud> Try rolling away instead of through
[4:37:57] <+jiggy_snipe> yea those pillars are fucking him
[4:38:01] <%RyTYoung> You're doing great Reggie, I was part of the wand gang when I fought him my first time sbfpRichard
[4:38:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:38:24] <jackelzxaa> hahaha
[4:38:26] <jackelzxaa> that pickaxe
[4:38:34] <OblivionSword1> he ded
[4:38:39] <%Frazzyfraznor> His rolls were on point first attempt
[4:39:04] <nailwind> first attempts always have more audacity
[4:39:18] <jackelzxaa> i've never actually made a boss weapon in DeS, i have always prioritized spells. i should try to focus more on weapons the next time i play
[4:39:47] <+PulleylubeTW> the boss spells are so good tho
[4:39:56] <jackelzxaa> it's suboptimal but i wonder if reggie's playstyle would feel more comfortable with a catalyst in his left hand and one handing his scimitar.
[4:39:56] <+PulleylubeTW> its understandable why you chose to use them
[4:40:11] <%notsoy> no, the regen from the shield
[4:40:13] <jackelzxaa> because it would allow him to do everything without thinking about switching
[4:40:20] <jackelzxaa> he would lose the regen tho
[4:40:29] <%RyTYoung> yes
[4:40:32] <+PulleylubeTW> lefthand catalyst takes awhile to get used to for alot of newer players i feel jackel
[4:40:42] <%Struggleful> EZ
[4:40:45] <roarofdamnation> That was fast
[4:40:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PulleylubeTW Yea, it's not easy
[4:40:51] <slix3431> You rolled, he lul'd
[4:40:55] <jackelzxaa> left hand catalyst is what he was using earlier is the thing
[4:41:01] <MyNameIsRasus> damn this and bb make me appreciate estus
[4:41:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> I finally did it in DS3 with a pyro-melee build. Ends up being more pyro than melee
[4:41:09] <+PulleylubeTW> for the weapon buff sure
[4:41:27] <+PulleylubeTW> but i mean just thinking about soul arrow and also using the blade might be 2 much for reggie atm
[4:41:49] <jackelzxaa> i was watching that hobbit movie and i saw gandalf with a staff in one hand and a longsword in the other and i was like "oh i want to try that in souls next time i play"
[4:42:15] <jackelzxaa> i've never done magic in the dark souls games, i've only ever brought some pyro or miracles, but never just gone for spells
[4:42:59] <jackelzxaa> theres ALOT of dark souls influence in tolken, more than i thought. Bilbo puts on the one ring and it lets him hear what the spiders are saying, which was a thing in DS1 and 2 (kinda)
[4:43:06] <jackelzxaa> (it was scorpion in 2)

[4:45:09] <jackelzxaa> the purple fire shield
[4:45:12] <jackelzxaa> if he didnt get it already
[4:45:20] <jackelzxaa> it lets you take flamelurker attacks if you have the str
[4:45:21] <Rixstarian> He's here now
[4:45:29] <jackelzxaa> you just put the shield up and he hits your shield and then you're fine
[4:45:30] <Rixstarian> Skill vs crutch
[4:45:33] <jackelzxaa> but only that shield, really
[4:45:34] <+jiggy_snipe> eh he's just gonna beat him this way
[4:45:37] <+Jaysky> Chat how would the flamelurker smell? Charred skin? Ash? Uhoh stinky?
[4:45:40] <%A_German_spy> @jackelzxaa He doesn't have enough strength for it. It's a 22 req.

[4:48:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Honestly, it might be better to beat some other areas and level up your weapons so do you more damage

[4:50:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Literally a single guy, me. It was me, Dio!!
[4:50:23] <nailwind> it's a tradition
[4:50:25] <%RyTYoung> @keiganofastora You've awoken the mentor who has been bean dadding Reggie for 5 hours LUL
[4:50:28] <roarofdamnation> No shield wand only 2 tries lets go Reggie!
[4:50:32] <roarofdamnation> ok 3 tries
[4:50:36] <+paladinstarbuster> better every time
[4:50:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> wokeCool
[4:50:42] <Estwilde> still not 2 handing
[4:50:51] <+jiggy_snipe> I wouldn't bother with the magic, just go 2 hand from the beginning
[4:50:55] <user_naim> KeiganOfReversePsychology
[4:50:56] <mark_collins45> Has Reggie tried not dying?
[4:51:01] <Explodincatz> remember the first attempt? that was fun
[4:51:09] <%RyTYoung> @mark_collins45 LUL
[4:51:12] <roarofdamnation> Anyway since we have the time, about that magic build we never got to talk about...
[4:51:12] <%Lion_kun> why is reggie getting worse?
[4:51:18] <jackelzxaa> @WoolieVersus the switching seems to trip reggie up enough that i wonder if he might be able to do good with just the fire defense ring and the catalyst in his left, even though it's suboptimal? (less to focus on in the fight)
[4:51:31] <slix3431> @Lion_kun Cause he's learning
[4:51:48] <OldManDeckardCain> @Lion_kun he is getting possesed by the salt god Havria Kappa
[4:51:56] <nailwind> attaining knowledge unlocks more ways to eat shit, its a double edged sword
[4:52:06] <+jiggy_snipe> 2 hand and no magic
[4:52:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:52:09] <+jiggy_snipe> let's go
[4:52:17] <+paladinstarbuster> or get better at switchng
[4:52:22] <jackelzxaa> "stop using magic" switches to his wand oops
[4:52:26] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> just focus on 2 handed sword swings, Reggie was kicking ass doing it
[4:52:27] <jackelzxaa> oh ok that was intentional
[4:52:42] <Aydarkzero> here we go
[4:52:44] <roarofdamnation> @Lion_kun Learning has spikes and valleys, he started with a spike, and entered a valley, and will enter a spike again
[4:52:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> perfect
[4:52:51] <%p4ntless> take it easy, but TAKE IT
[4:52:53] <+Grayhammatter> perfect
[4:53:00] <nailwind> Reggarth will never be the same after the boss falls
[4:53:00] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, are we fighting Pat?
[4:53:07] <user_naim> P e r f e c t
[4:53:14] <roarofdamnation> Also we are never letting go of magic lets go magical Reggarth!
[4:53:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is good
[4:53:22] <%Lion_kun> this looks like a peak
[4:53:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> The magic wand was throwing him off
[4:53:31] <nailwind> the boss is getting shy
[4:53:32] <Khotgor> The Fire Demon is weak to Bitchic
[4:53:33] <slix3431> Try some other areas then come back tho

[5:00:42] <nailwind> flamelurker has made people quit
[5:01:01] <dundore77> What about the Orgiinal version where there was a piece of debris that he would get reliably stuck on allowing you to safely plunk away at him.
[5:01:03] <%bread_assassin> Flamelurker is a Dark Souls boss put into Demon's Souls.
[5:01:05] <+jiggy_snipe> he's the most non puzzle like boss
[5:01:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> And the low HP relative to other games meaning you don't get many chances before death
[5:01:16] <%Amaideus> I dunked Flamelurker on my first run, but I also did DeS fourth (DS3 wasn't out yet)
[5:01:16] <+Jaysky> Reminds me of Barioth in Monster Hunter Tri
[5:01:23] <jackelzxaa> flamelurker, maneaters, false king, and depending on how you handle it, penetrator is that tier too.
[5:01:23] <Josef_Stryker> Flamelurker is a motherfucker
[5:01:23] <Aussie_Manny> those people are COWARDS

[5:02:23] <%JobbedBone> can't a strong word, I always say "not yet"
[5:02:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> hahahaha
[5:02:24] <pkthepipes> more like double-decker backseat BITCHES
[5:02:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Woolie getting rekt
[5:02:29] <%Lion_kun> THE SALT
[5:02:38] <nailwind> few men can reach levels of bitch Woolie did during Black Mesa
[5:02:42] <Tooniearcade> kmaHmm1 kmaHmm1 kmaHmm1
[5:03:03] <+jiggy_snipe> I'm learning the matchup tho >:[
[5:03:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wan?
[5:03:07] <+Fnir> fighting games !
[5:03:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> it's won, not wan LUL
[5:03:12] <Slim_Lipid> there's progress being made even if the level isn't beaten
[5:03:21] <SomersaultJustice> IT'S GROWING
[5:03:22] <dundore77> @WoolieVersus which is a bigger bitch that or the people who cheesed him by getting him stuck on the debris?
[5:03:25] <%Irridium> the personal experience bar is growing
[5:03:42] <Estwilde> I think 1/4 of all players stopped Dark Souls before ringing the first bell
[5:03:49] <pmda2126> a win is a win
[5:03:55] <%BinaryFireball> believe in the chat that believes in chode power
[5:03:59] <roarofdamnation> Now lets talk about that magic lvl up
[5:03:59] <+Jaysky> Getting better and better with each turn, that's how a DRILL works
[5:04:04] <%ekodrop> it's time to change areas
[5:04:12] <roarofdamnation> Na not dex get that magic man!
[5:04:19] <+paladinstarbuster> GET MAGIC
[5:04:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> More damage if you upgrade the weapon
[5:04:29] <%Lion_kun> 5 hours for one zone lol
[5:04:38] <+PulleylubeTW> leveling dex and str equally will let you get alot of damage from quality eapons
[5:04:39] <%Lion_kun> well 2-2 is tricky
[5:04:44] <%BinaryFireball> magic makes this game pretty easy... to quote everyone ever
[5:04:47] <+paladinstarbuster> There is cool shit
[5:04:48] <+PulleylubeTW> and again, 14 int for another spell slot
[5:04:53] <+jiggy_snipe> he spent most the time exploring 2-2 and getting lost Kappa
[5:04:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> But that means more stats being spread thin. Arrows would be better since you're going with Dex
[5:05:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair bows in souls games are kinda fucked as far as ease of use goes
[5:05:18] <roarofdamnation> Magic means a better crescent falchion too
[5:05:24] <+PulleylubeTW> ^
[5:05:38] <%Amaideus> Bows are fine from DS2 onward
[5:05:40] <+PulleylubeTW> magic will increase those crescent weapons for sure
[5:05:44] <%Amaideus> Before that they're only good for cheesing
[5:05:53] <greytiziocaio> Honestly at this point go fo Quality with 20 Strength and 30 Dexterity
[5:05:54] <%Frazzyfraznor> The lava bow kicks ass
[5:05:56] <wunderkindest> Bows don't even start getting mechanically useful until DS3 when shortbows get that roll shot
[5:06:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> Different weapons for different areas
[5:06:14] <@Menitta> Or do, water is healthy
[5:06:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:06:19] <gunsrlove> ...isn't falchion broken af in general?
[5:06:20] <+paladinstarbuster> 14 magic
[5:06:23] <+NeonLight> Hydration reminder everyone
[5:06:28] <@Menitta> Drink water
[5:06:37] <roarofdamnation> 14 int
[5:06:40] <+PulleylubeTW> 14 for 2, 18 for 3
[5:06:43] <BerryliciousDefinition> Hydrate or diedrate
[5:07:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @wunderkindest that feel when the best souls bow mechanics are in nioh
[5:07:22] <+discognition> Don't forget Endurance!
[5:07:23] <+PulleylubeTW> also keep in mind that the strongest spells will take more than one spell slot
[5:07:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> You sure?
[5:08:03] <roarofdamnation> You have pocket souls tho
[5:08:06] <%ekodrop> sup ed

[5:14:46] <%ekodrop> good
[5:14:55] <jackelzxaa> i was panicking that that was a "you got one shot" thing
[5:15:00] <+collin_delorean3610> he will bonk you with the Ban Hammer.
[5:15:11] <%Irridium> I mean this game as a few "you only get one shot" so it's understandable
[5:15:27] <redrins> talk?
[5:15:50] <%Lion_kun> doesn't reggie have to go home?
[5:16:01] <jackelzxaa> i wish flamelurker didnt have good spells because i always hate turning it over
[5:16:06] <%kyh9> it is the same
[5:16:06] <%ekodrop> same line
[5:16:21] <%kyh9> Reggie has more RAM than woolie
[5:17:08] <Slim_Lipid> how come not even the wikis have a weapon tree üòê
[5:17:25] <+TopTieramisu> wikis are convoluted in boletaria
[5:17:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wikidot is really good
[5:18:17] <+TopTieramisu> yeah. screw fextra
[5:18:29] <roarofdamnation> Oh man the grinding or we could go full magic + crescent falchion
[5:18:44] <jackelzxaa> are we gonna do some big dragon man
[5:18:57] <redrins> @jackelzxaa I dont remember the flamelurker soul giving any spells
[5:19:05] <jackelzxaa> it does flame surge i believe
[5:19:10] <+TopTieramisu> there's only one boss weapon that matters in des
[5:19:25] <%Amaideus> Scraping spear!
[5:19:32] <%Amaideus> Most certainly not a Brandt
[5:19:33] <+TopTieramisu> ok, 2
[5:19:35] <%Amaideus> Definitely
[5:19:42] <%Amaideus> Kek
[5:20:10] <+TopTieramisu> did they ever patch the luck glitch?
[5:20:45] <jackelzxaa> aw no 2-3?
[5:20:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:20:52] <redrins> I'm pretty sure the flamelurker soul only exists for the blacksmith
[5:20:53] <%Amaideus> Curfew
[5:20:58] <+TopTieramisu> crap, i missed the flamelurker fight
[5:21:06] <jackelzxaa> oh yeah, flamelurker isnt fire surge
[5:21:08] <jackelzxaa> thats armor spider
[5:21:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @redrins you also make it into fireball
[5:21:21] <+paladinstarbuster> DRAGON
[5:21:33] <+Grayhammatter> DRAGON
[5:21:36] <redrins> @abelincoln_catpuncher thats from 2-3 with freke
[5:21:36] <%Amaideus> I miss the old DeS load screens
[5:21:56] <nailwind> flight attained
[5:21:58] <+TopTieramisu> you can see the load screen art in the main menu
[5:22:35] <+TopTieramisu> after experiencing this game's load times, i don't think i can ever go back LUL
[5:22:48] <ChungusQuest> gotta love the weighty feel of those swings...there's some meat in that sword
[5:23:02] <+PulleylubeTW> freke is the homie
[5:23:11] <%Irridium> FoF - Friend of Freke
[5:23:12] <+paladinstarbuster> SAGE FREAK
[5:23:17] <+TopTieramisu> freke is big hat logan before he went mad
[5:23:21] <+Grayhammatter> sage FREAK
[5:23:34] <+TopTieramisu> not literally, but he's definitely on the same path
[5:23:53] <%Amaideus> Huh, didn't know that they still had them
[5:24:01] <%Amaideus> I prefer most of the old arts though, awk
[5:24:20] <+TopTieramisu> i don't like some of the remake redesigns
[5:24:21] <+PulleylubeTW> soul RAY
[5:24:24] <+TopTieramisu> particularly a certain npc
[5:24:30] <+TopTieramisu> and their armor
[5:24:33] <knight_of_the_edge> fire spray!!!!!!
[5:24:34] <jackelzxaa> warding is HEARTY
[5:24:48] <+PulleylubeTW> warding is like 70% physical reduction for 30 seconds
[5:24:55] <+PulleylubeTW> nutty spell
[5:24:58] <jackelzxaa> its the best defense buff spell in the series without saccrificing weight
[5:25:02] <+Grayhammatter> Foolishness dante
[5:25:12] <jackelzxaa> searing demon soul doesnt make anything, it's only for the handoff or for 18k souls
[5:25:16] <roarofdamnation> Fire Spray is da way
[5:25:31] <jackelzxaa> soul ray is ridiculous
[5:25:53] <roarofdamnation> Is a bow he is not using bow
[5:25:54] <+PulleylubeTW> ah yes the spider soul weapon is sick
[5:26:17] <jackelzxaa> reggies eyebrows when woolie said lava bow
[5:26:32] <stardustcrusad3r> woobie
[5:26:48] <%ekodrop> spray and ray are dope
[5:26:49] <roarofdamnation> but fire spray
[5:26:56] <%Rajion_1> Of course reggie would love the lava bow, its a consumable :D
[5:27:09] <jackelzxaa> theres a certain red dragon that you can only kill with a bow and arrow that is worth 30% of white world tendency
[5:28:19] <+TopTieramisu> 2-2 is probably the longest level in the game
[5:28:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:28:31] <%kyh9> Just like my English Tolkien books
[5:28:32] <Rixstarian> @jackelzxaa You can melee kill him
[5:28:41] <dundore77> Its just final fantasy Ifrit
[5:28:51] <+PulleylubeTW> flamelurker is actually the demon form of one of the smithing brothers
[5:28:52] <+TopTieramisu> flamelurker stands out in demon's souls as a boss without some big gimmick
[5:29:10] <jackelzxaa> I REALLY wish you could do the 1-3 npc quest without ruining the boss fight of the zone
[5:29:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I KNEW it was a milisecond out of sync
[5:29:19] <jackelzxaa> bjorh
[5:29:32] <jackelzxaa> he is too strong but you lose dialog if you save him later, right?
[5:29:46] <%Lion_kun> the salt in this one was real
[5:29:53] <jackelzxaa> it wasn't until my third run that i fought penetrator for real and it was a blast
[5:30:14] <roarofdamnation> Ok people brace up next episode will be the episode in which Wooloe convinces Reggie to forget about magic and go full into a full sex build, this is practically a spoiler comment.
[5:30:27] <+TopTieramisu> save creativity for subsequent playthroughs
[5:30:29] <%ekodrop> you can be naked in real life too
[5:31:03] <roarofdamnation> dex*
[5:31:20] <+PulleylubeTW> Kippa

[5:37:10] <+Proxzo> I mean, NZ got other good stuff going on though.
[5:37:12] <+mauricefaurron> Oceania is the continent, Australia is a Country
[5:37:18] <@akuda_bar> i'm not interested in getting one for ages yet anyway
[5:37:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can't wait for bots to take them all again
[5:37:25] <+Proxzo> If not getting a ps5 is the most of your worries, I call that a win.
[5:37:34] <Belakitu> Is the session done for today?
[5:37:37] <+DJ_Omen> Australia IS continent dumbass
[5:37:41] <Rixstarian> @mauricefaurron Oceania is the region. Australia is island, country & continent
[5:37:50] <%Lion_kun> well maybe not Maneater
[5:37:50] <+alphonseisbest> man i don't even have the cash for one even i got get ahold of one FeelsBadMan T-T
[5:38:03] <+Grayhammatter> yep @Belakitu
[5:38:06] <Ciriliko> are we sure Australia is even real?
[5:38:14] <jackelzxaa> theres 3 other really hard bosses but one of them you can miss out on because of how the quests work
[5:38:22] <Belakitu> Oh right, the curfew
[5:38:26] <Rixstarian> @ciriliko It's real only while my anti-gravity belt is secured
