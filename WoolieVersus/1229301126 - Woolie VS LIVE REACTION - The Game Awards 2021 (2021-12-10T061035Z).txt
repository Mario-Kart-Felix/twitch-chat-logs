[0:45:44] <%livlinn> We need Deere to cleanse Cage joofbBless
[0:45:44] <amcq99> Detroit was good but only the parts Cage didn't write

[0:46:17] <amcq99> Is Eastward short
[0:46:17] <goblinaccountant> This is cope
[0:46:18] <AngryAsian5> Detroit would've been better if they completely cut out Kara's story and just focused on the other two.
[0:46:20] <+SPARTAN_KD21> As someone from Detroit I found that game endlessly amusing with how much QD and Cage got wrong
[0:46:20] <+meloshav> they might claim this
[0:46:21] <Jaysky> Detroit is a buddy cop movie with an android
[0:46:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> at least Disney would be in DIRECT CONTROL of the writing and story of thatgame and David Cage would have ALL THE REINS ON HIS NECK

[1:15:57] <+Jack8274> I've read a few Wuxia manwa's
[1:15:57] <Nocturnment> Too much like Wakanda
[1:15:59] <Aussie_Manny> Minh doesn't like it 'cause it's not accurate to Asian culture?
[1:16:03] <Dio_TR> THAT MAKES SENSE
[1:16:03] <BreakersAweigh> I see where he's coming from now
[1:16:04] <KuroPhantomX> so  basically Hollywood being hollwood
[1:16:04] <jorniev> destiny?
[1:16:05] <amcq99> So Minh wanted american wuxia and not just wuxia wuxia. I respect that take
[1:16:05] <fuji_n2> yeah thats actually a good point from minh
[1:16:06] <%Sparkseid> 100% valid minh
[1:16:06] <Parapattern> Not just Asia, but ASIA Asia
[1:16:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Minh was a hero, I just couldn't see it
[1:16:07] <knight_verse> Chinese Wakanda...
[1:16:07] <Johannen> Nah, its whack Mihn right
[1:16:08] <+impressionistcowboy> it would have been so hype
[1:16:08] <emptyantics> I AGREE
[1:16:08] <Louie_Salmon> Okay yeah that adds up
[1:16:09] <haitakaa> oof
[1:16:09] <pet_purple_panda> @dai_tonight an ok Shooter looter so long as you have friends who play it

[1:16:10] <TonutWasTaken> team minh on this one tbh
[1:16:11] <caramel_coffin> how was it Wakanda lol it was a small village
[1:16:13] <MyNameIsRasus> I have Asian friends who have echoed Minh's opinion, he's right
[1:16:14] <%DensityD> PHENOMENAL TAKE
[1:16:14] <Hydrapissed> ITS A TUESDAY for min
[1:16:14] <AnnoyedApricot> I get it
[1:16:15] <youngking_kush> But like, that's what we wanna see lol
[1:16:15] <Tham1k> Thats fair
[1:16:15] <+eddi401> BASED
[1:16:15] <Aussie_Manny> Oohhhhhh, I see.
[1:16:16] <+Jiggisnipe> @Aussie_Manny he doesn't like it cause it isn't novel
[1:16:17] <dai_tonight> @Aussie_Manny No, he doesn't like it because it's just yet another asian kungfu movie in the last act
[1:16:17] <%Vigonept> ive seen wuxia before yeah
[1:16:19] <Dio_TR> BASED
[1:16:21] <+robertoszek> understandable
[1:16:21] <dds333a> Minh actually makes sense
[1:16:21] <+mechslayer71> okay that makes sense

[1:16:21] <%ekodrop> yea
[1:16:21] <+DatAsuna> I want that curse of the golden flower shit
[1:16:22] <Dotados> it was mindless action.
[1:16:22] <+ttvp> Destiny 4
[1:16:22] <kirbykyodai> that makes sense yeah
[1:16:24] <+falliblecannibal> I get it Minh
[1:16:24] <+Jaromero435> Based Mihn
[1:16:25] <%DensityD> it was tuesday
[1:16:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I have actually hearrd this opinion
[1:16:25] <%Bread_Assassin> You know what, fair
[1:16:26] <+blink289> IMO there isnt a lot of marvel money wuxia shit out there
[1:16:27] <+pkmamsters> also choreography was better in the first half
[1:16:28] <@Solidus_113> Minh is valid
[1:16:29] <blue6sub6remnant6> Minh makes a salient point that validates his opinion wholly.
[1:16:29] <andre11dr> That's a valid take
[1:16:31] <dai_tonight> I don't agree with minh btw
[1:16:31] <%kewlmyc> Is this Destiny?
[1:16:35] <kazadaz> It gestured at doing something new, then segued into an imitation of something that exists
[1:16:35] <%DensityD> Old Asia
[1:16:36] <+CrmznOgre> SPEAK MHIN SPEAK
[1:16:37] <%patriotrenegade> destiny 6

[1:16:41] <Aussie_Manny> Okay, I get where Minh is coming from now.
[1:16:41] <+samuraiknack> Yo do you guys like Kung Fu? Well we are putting shitty Cgi and stupid mystic shit all over it
[1:16:41] <%DensityD> correct, this is Destiny 2
[1:16:41] <+jaguarkek318> they really had a training arc tho, it was like 10 min but dammit it was a training arc
[1:16:42] <pet_purple_panda> @kewlmyc yeah new dlc
[1:16:42] <Drunkengen> Minh's right
[1:16:42] <dds333a> LUL
[1:16:43] <Louie_Salmon> So is this somehow not Destiny 2?
[1:16:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this looks like Outriders again
[1:16:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> go minh go
[1:16:45] <DaKnightWarrior> Same shit, different day.
[1:16:45] <Arqartur0> Yeah, I can see and respect Minh's point of View; same thing I felt with Coco, and Coco is a good movie.
[1:16:47] <knight_verse> @caramel_coffin It's  an entire alternate dimension...
[1:16:48] <kikoeru_san> Minh's spittin'
[1:16:51] <jorniev> it's Destiny
[1:16:52] <pet_purple_panda> @Louie_Salmon it is
[1:16:52] <fuji_n2> destiny ResidentSleeper
[1:16:52] <+MightyDuckShoes> It's the difference between the Wakanda experience and the Miles Morales experience
[1:16:54] <emptyantics> TALK YA SHIT KING LET YA NUTS HANG
[1:16:54] <Dio_TR> MINH SPITTING
[1:16:58] <alphalejandro> the stream is dying
[1:17:02] <notadeasterisk> yes macau
[1:17:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but I guess its Destiny
[1:17:06] <andre11dr> Damn , the stream is dying
[1:17:07] <+The_Devil_Breaker> That's interesting because the opposite happened with Black Panther. We as black people got to see a grand representation of black people in a positive light. We got to see cultural elements of PROGRESS that are scarce in media/fiction.
[1:17:09] <caramel_coffin> @knight_verse yeah but its not like the heaven for Chinese people, it was just a village that is overlooking the dark gate
[1:17:09] <%debrv> Alright Minh. I see what your are talkin' about.
[1:17:10] <+Jiggisnipe> @MightyDuckShoes apt point
[1:17:12] <%wolfofsound> "we want urban"
[1:17:13] <dds333a> PJSalt
[1:17:13] <+vaderxyz1970> This race talk is more interesting than the award show
[1:17:14] <Hammatime8> Why does this trailer feel so long
[1:17:16] <dai_tonight> stream is stuttering
[1:17:17] <+jaguarkek318> Wong stays the best JoBro in marvel
[1:17:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i see what he means
[1:17:20] <Hydrapissed> ITS A TUESDAY for min
[1:17:21] <%kewlmyc> 100% Valid
[1:17:23] <%Vigonept> thats a fine take
[1:17:24] <amcq99> Minh didn't want Wuxia, he wanted Kamen Rider
[1:17:26] <dds333a> on his shoulder
[1:17:29] <%patriotrenegade> this is way too long for a Destiny DLC
[1:17:30] <+The_Devil_Breaker> @WoolieVersus That's interesting because the opposite happened with Black Panther. We as black people got to see a grand representation of black people in a positive light. We got to see cultural elements of PROGRESS that are scarce in media/fiction.
[1:17:31] <FrostedZaibatsu> Thats like the opposite of Wakanda
[1:17:31] <Dio_TR> 100 Valid
[1:17:31] <MyNameIsRasus> Great take
[1:17:37] <emptyantics> @amcq99 Hell yeah
[1:17:38] <BreakersAweigh> yeah that's valid
[1:17:38] <Darmanimon> it's like how Forza Horizon 5 is a super innacurate version of Mexico
[1:17:40] <Arqartur0> Warframe?
[1:17:40] <%hax_metatron> Minh shutting it down with a valid reason LUL
[1:17:40] <+flipsilog> this is the most recycled game ever..
[1:17:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BRUUHHHHH
[1:17:42] <%kewlmyc> The subway fight is still the best thing in the movie imo
[1:17:42] <+uncle_emoji> I just thought the end should have cool kung fu instead of so much CGI
[1:17:43] <jorniev> MORE KAMEN RIDER
[1:17:45] <dai_tonight> I didn't feel any of the parts to be "cringe" tbh
[1:17:45] <pet_purple_panda> Valid take Minh
[1:17:45] <%Lancaster_H> or was it based
[1:17:46] <Parapattern> Destiny is still going?
[1:17:46] <Aussie_Manny> How DARE
[1:17:47] <Darmanimon> the map doesn't exist geographically in the real world
[1:17:48] <youngking_kush> Damn I like Destiny but this is long af
[1:17:48] <+shradke> Nice more content that won‚Äôt be available in a year
[1:17:49] <+commoncurium> @The_Devil_Breaker 100% agreed. Changed my damn life. I grew my damn hair out to match King Killmonger.
[1:17:49] <+aClicheHipster> the bus scene makes the first half imo
[1:17:52] <CaptainBright> Ben Kingsley slightly lifts up those asian sections
[1:18:03] <+0neReeler> just watch battle in the bronx again
[1:18:04] <TrigunSTAR26> lmao
[1:18:06] <+eddi401> I concur
[1:18:07] <knight_verse> @caramel_coffin Also the mural where they point out the whole futuristic magical city they had before the big bad destroyed their civilization... but sure...

[1:56:23] <%ennui_on_me> yooo web swinging
[1:56:23] <wawila> @WoolieVersus That is Arkham Knights not this one
[1:56:24] <Johannen> Looks nothing like Arkham games)
[1:56:25] <shooziii> How many banes tho?
[1:56:28] <dds333a> they did that woolie LUL
[1:56:28] <+profanityincluded> poruka oruka

[1:56:29] <+allups> give me more hero games
[1:56:29] <theinfamousq> woolie was a master at Arkham
[1:56:30] <%Prevot> that may be the worst harley design Ive ever seen
[1:56:30] <+fizzguy47> Avengers is a low bar, to be fair
[1:56:31] <%DensityD> you may be over simplifiing woolie
[1:56:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:56:33] <+Tennochief> looks like Saint's Row
[1:56:34] <Nano4211> RIP Superman game that was canceled

[1:56:37] <kikoeru_san> this too fun to be Arkham
[1:56:37] <DaKnightWarrior> BANE WILL RETURN
[1:56:39] <+mecha_11> I dont think that's a fair comparison
[1:56:39] <NinjaGentleman> Valorant LUL
[1:56:39] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus No that's Arkham Knights not this
[1:56:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> harley's design aside, this actually looks decent
[1:56:40] <+allups> i wouldnt say that
[1:56:41] <emptyantics> It‚Äôs a 3rd person shooter?!
[1:56:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @glassesaregod
[1:56:42] <fatlystackedmac> it ain't suicide squad if there ain't no fuckin polka
[1:56:43] <haitakaa> I think that's wrong
[1:56:44] <raknikmik> its a shlooter tho
[1:56:45] <+Tevvy> this is not the arkham game
[1:56:45] <Johannen> Woolie HOT TAKES
[1:56:45] <%DensityD> I disagree, not arkham, just like 2 arkham elements
[1:56:47] <@Solidus_113> there's also Gotham Knights
[1:56:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Sunset Overdrive meets Batman
[1:56:49] <+dekkitout> Kinda reminds me of Sunset Overdrive
[1:56:49] <+mecha_11> thus gameplay seems way different
[1:56:50] <Darmanimon> 3rd person is at least cool
[1:56:51] <kazadaz> Knight was in 2015
[1:56:51] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus no its not thats a different Harley
[1:56:51] <$SilverRoddo> Gotham city imposters?!
[1:56:53] <Shardlab> Arkham Knight
[1:56:53] <amcq99> Everyone but Harley looks super hype
[1:56:54] <jorniev> MAKE A LOBO GAME
[1:56:54] <BreakersAweigh> this looks nothing like the Arkham games though

[1:56:58] <Aussie_Manny> NOM NOM
[1:56:58] <+robertoszek> Arkham? it looks an awful lot like that Avengers game
[1:56:58] <%Qsmash_> was that Vanquish style knee sliding?
[1:56:58] <FunkyWaters> STREET SHARKS
[1:56:58] <+KilogramHours> HULK JUMP
[1:56:59] <+starlorb3> theres a lot fo shooting for arkham
[1:56:59] <pet_purple_panda> looks more like Sunset Overdrive than Arkham
[1:57:00] <raymeats> this looks more like sunset overdrive than arkham.
[1:57:00] <knight_verse> No... no it isn't, it's  just set in the same world.
[1:57:01] <%debrv> Could you imagine like a full Suicide Squad Roster.
[1:57:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> This doesn't really seem very Arkham
[1:57:03] <+Weeewer> Woolie X Arkham
[1:57:03] <%DensityD> thank you @SilverRoddo
[1:57:04] <wawila> @WoolieVersus Arkaham Knights is the one you are thinking about. Another game
[1:57:05] <Arqartur0> I really hate it now that they use the bullets in the soundtrack to accentuate it.
[1:57:06] <+dekkitout> This IS Arkham canon
[1:57:06] <+Jrocy247> This seems more like Infamous/Prototype
[1:57:07] <%FreshSquozeBreastMilk> sharkman makes out with zombie
[1:57:07] <Twon_From_Wakanda> woolie just stop

[1:57:36] <GhoulishCripple> they announced a Court of Owls game AT THE SAME TIME as this one

[1:57:43] <TheMadDemoknight> Gotham Knights is a REBOOT
[1:57:43] <thatoneguy066> No this is Suicide Squad.
[1:57:44] <+Jack8274> Gotham Knights was WB Games Montr√©al, not Rocksteady chat
[1:57:45] <Aussie_Manny> 4spoken
[1:57:45] <+KaguraRaion> Youre thinking of gotham knights
[1:57:46] <amcq99> with the isekai lady
[1:57:46] <+Deasmeister> Not arkham gameplay though
[1:57:47] <+KilogramHours> GOTHAM KNIGHTS WOOLIE
[1:57:47] <%patriotrenegade> Gotham City Imposters
[1:57:48] <CrazyJake007> There are two Batman games coming out and one is the continuation
[1:57:49] <+itspequod1> Oof is getting hot in here?
[1:57:52] <pet_purple_panda> This is Arkham universe, but the guns make that look WAY different
[1:57:52] <+allups> its canon but there is a new Arkham game too
[1:57:52] <@Solidus_113> WHERE'S FF16
[1:57:53] <+Standard_Enemy> Forspoken looks cool
[1:57:54] <+Jack8274> That was WB Games Montr√©al
[1:57:54] <+survivalone> oh god this cringy game
[1:57:54] <emptyantics> GOTHAM KNIGHTS WOOLIE
[1:57:55] <bearwagon> im pretty sure woolie was referring to the fact that its set in the same universe as the Arkham games, and that Gotham Knights is a different game
[1:57:55] <raknikmik> woolie is thinking of gotham knights
[1:57:55] <nintega010> The isekai that max didn't know about
[1:57:55] <raymeats> ff16
[1:57:56] <youngking_kush> ITS GOTHAM KNIGHTS WOOLIE
[1:57:56] <%wolfofsound> Kreygasm oh boy
[1:57:56] <kazadaz> WB Montreal is making Gotham Knights, Rocksteady is making this thing
[1:57:57] <dds333a> neither game is really Exactly Like the arkham games
[1:57:57] <+robertoszek> Forsaken looked rough last time
[1:57:57] <+mecha_11> The gameplay looks very different though.
[1:57:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> why is Forspoken basically Infamous 4
[1:57:59] <raymeats> pls
[1:58:00] <KaiserMario> Fartsinpocket
[1:58:00] <+boomstarprime> this is Arkham lore that's why there's no batman or joker
[1:58:02] <+survivalone> This game is the one with the cringy as fuck dialogue
[1:58:02] <rainthelingeringwind> I'm actually curious about this game.
[1:58:02] <+00ichi00> lol there two games
[1:58:04] <fuji_n2> no
[1:58:05] <+TheScorpionEater> still makes you wrong LUL

[1:58:05] <+CaptainPyron> @WoolieVersus Don't worry. You're right. Chat's not paying attention.
[1:58:06] <emptyantics> @solidus_113 I cant wait for them to show it
[1:58:10] <KidKaiser23> Gotham Knights is the next Arkham but NOT canon to Arkham, whilst Suicide Squad is NOT like Arkham but is Canon
[1:58:11] <kazadaz> NO-ONE KNOWS
[1:58:12] <+samuraiknack> This is Arkham, Gotham Knights is its own thing

[2:04:21] <%Prevot> god, this cringe fest
[2:04:22] <+DatAsuna> GitS arise had a good take on that
[2:04:23] <mortalmanbaby> SOMA IS SOOOO GOOD
[2:04:24] <el_biribon> Woolie vs SOMA needs to happen now
[2:04:26] <KaiserMario> It's pretty much how Praying Mantis' have kids
[2:04:26] <+saltpiggu> I mean, your gonna die anyway
[2:04:27] <Arqartur0> Que jodas es esto!?
[2:04:27] <QueequegTheater> THE BRAIN IS FLESH AND HLESH IS THE ENEMY
[2:04:27] <%neraren> Woolie of Thesius
[2:04:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus is the ship of Theseus, Reggie is a new boat
[2:04:28] <kikoeru_san> no Woolie is Hakumen
[2:04:30] <%Vigonept> DONT TOUCH MY BRAIN
[2:04:30] <w_khan> I am ok with just my brain
[2:04:30] <%khalcipher> Same, Woolie
[2:04:30] <Rein_Paladin> as long as the brain exist then we exist so its ok
[2:04:32] <kinkade_77> will this end have as big of a pop as elden ring reveal?
[2:04:33] <+robertoszek> Reggie VS SOMA

[2:04:34] <+coldsama> Saints Row give me the same vibe Back 4 Blood gives me,that's aint it
[2:04:35] <+terry_quest> did woolie play soma?
[2:04:36] <dfs_k> a better trailer for SR, how hard was it to do the first time
[2:04:36] <Darren716> Why does all of this look the same as Saints 3?
[2:04:36] <+Tevvy> old man's war
[2:04:36] <linxonia> Posthumanism
[2:04:36] <amcq99> None of these people look like gang members
[2:04:36] <$BioStormX> @WoolieVersus What if every time you go to sleep your consciousness "ends" (dies) and when you wake up a new one is produced from your memories
[2:04:37] <+deiulamb> Saints Trigger Racists
[2:04:38] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Every time you go to sleep you die
[2:04:39] <+Infeirno23> this just looks like saints row to me
[2:04:42] <kazadaz> Woolie if you could get a body mod so you would never need to sleep, would you?
[2:04:42] <+boomstarprime> this looks bad
[2:04:45] <FeXd> If you melt a spoon then make a fork with it, is it a spoon or a fork?
[2:04:47] <+jaguarkek318> Soma is upsetting
[2:04:48] <FunkyWaters> Has Woolie played SOMA?
[2:04:48] <+DatAsuna> Woolie doesn't want a brain case? weak
[2:04:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> woolie should really play SOMA
[2:04:49] <blue6sub6remnant6> "A new Woolie replaces the sleeping one every night."
[2:04:50] <%Prevot> this game is zoomers acting gangsta

[2:16:30] <w_khan> yeah
[2:16:31] <Overloard> wasnt this supposed to be Borderlands 3 DLC?
[2:16:31] <FrostedZaibatsu> Borderlands 3 just ruined the Telltale characters. I just couldnt get into it
[2:16:31] <amcq99> that's sad
[2:16:33] <anthropomorphictempest> is this a guardians
[2:16:34] <Captbutt> fucking love tales of the borderlands
[2:16:34] <Solidnick18> it was i guess
[2:16:36] <+robertoszek> rip telltale
[2:16:36] <jorniev> THE BEST ONE
[2:16:37] <tenshi_q> just play BL2 dragonkeep
[2:16:37] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> wanda could be good i guess LUL
[2:16:40] <%ennui_on_me> you got a bit of a... hollow-y, thing, goin on, just around the eyes there
[2:16:41] <+boomstarprime> so just more borderlands ok I guess
[2:16:42] <+saltpiggu> yeah but tails of the borderlands wasn't written by gearbox
[2:16:43] <MyNameIsRasus> THEY FLY NOW???
[2:16:43] <w_khan> When Wolf Among Us 2?
[2:16:44] <%patriotrenegade> IS that GORTYS
[2:16:44] <%diegobandzz> This looks pretty bad
[2:16:44] <+Mutraex> I hate how Borderlands is genuinely really fun, but also cringe as hell
[2:16:45] <alphalejandro> Max's probably spinning his chairs right now
[2:16:46] <Aussie_Manny> Tales of the Borderlands was incredible. Woolie and Matt's LP of it was the best.
[2:16:46] <nomos42> yeh is that Sandburg?
[2:16:48] <emptyantics> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:16:48] <fatlystackedmac> I like the song tho

[2:16:57] <%neraren> I liked Wolf a lot
[2:16:57] <mantistheone> still cant believe telltale is back
[2:16:58] <+impressionistcowboy> I just wish they went back to the subtle bleak stuff from borderlands 1
[2:16:59] <+BillHicks5051> Tiny Tina still voiced by Ashe?
[2:17:00] <+KaguraRaion> Wolf
[2:17:02] <+DatAsuna> for me it's wolf among us
[2:17:02] <%kewlmyc> TWD S1 is still the best
[2:17:02] <studleydoorite> is this music fake or real Sleigh Bells?
[2:17:02] <anthropomorphictempest> MC is living Joss Whedon dialogue
[2:17:03] <Aussie_Manny> Batman was good.
[2:17:04] <kazadaz> It's crazy that six-year-olds can write games now
[2:17:04] <Drunkengen> GLASS HIM
[2:17:05] <youngking_kush> Borderlands is great they just have shit writers
[2:17:05] <plumpshiny> And togue oh baby
[2:17:06] <+TheScorpionEater> Wolf Amogus tho
[2:17:06] <raknikmik> Wolf
[2:17:07] <w_khan> Batman Season 2 was amazing
[2:17:07] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Wasnt Batman good tooZ?
[2:17:07] <kikoeru_san> Borderlands be like: y'all like DnD? We can do a DnD thing, we like DnD
[2:17:08] <+profanityincluded> wolf > borderlands > walking dead

[2:17:17] <+Grapple_R> I'm Glad Roland isn't alive to see this
[2:17:18] <%Lancaster_H> TWD S1 is still number 1
[2:17:18] <Kghaleon> Borderlands 3 was the only bad game.
[2:17:19] <Ninjafury227> man i miss when i liked borderlands

[2:17:26] <%FreshSquozeBreastMilk> @dai_tonight well shes an animated child so
[2:17:26] <jorniev> this looks passable
[2:17:27] <Captbutt> im sure the game is gonna be fun but this trailer is...not it
[2:17:28] <Arqartur0> so it's you playing D&D in Borderlands
[2:17:29] <Darmanimon> wolf among us gave us the Glass Him sequence
[2:17:29] <blue6sub6remnant6> "Glass 'em"
[2:17:30] <rasamune> shark dance
[2:17:33] <+profanityincluded> it needed a second season
[2:17:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:17:34] <%Suneater_Jerome> didn't they say the sequel is cancelled?
[2:17:35] <+JFKRobot> "glass him"
[2:17:36] <tenshi_q> Borderlands 3 was a good game with AWFUL writing
[2:17:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Wolf looking kinda sus

[2:17:44] <jorniev> GLASS HIM
[2:17:46] <@Menitta> Tiny Tina's Balan Wonderland
[2:17:48] <+SeanConnery94> expanse is my favorite thing ever made

[2:17:53] <Ashenik1> GLASS HIM
[2:17:53] <+mechslayer71> @tenshi_q i agree 100x
[2:17:54] <QueequegTheater> @Arqartur0 It was much less cringe when it was just its own DLC in Borderlands 2 NotLikeThis

[2:52:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:52:41] <dai_tonight> forza horizon 5 is really good
[2:52:42] <%kewlmyc> Well, When is the last time Turismo released a fucking game?
[2:52:42] <dds333a> (I don't want chat to know I actually love racing games)
[2:52:42] <%livlinn> woolieMINHMAX woolieVS HypeCar HyperHex
[2:52:43] <+Infeirno23> Midnight Club was the best driving game
[2:52:46] <Nocturnment> they need F1 cars in forza
[2:52:46] <Frostydough1> Forza has literally perfected the sound and the movement  and visuals of cars. personally i dont give a single fuck but props to them for honing their craft
[2:52:47] <w_khan> its fun to  drive around
[2:52:48] <dai_tonight> forza 5 is good game
[2:52:49] <+samuraiknack> BRING BACK DRIVE CLUB YOU Cowards
[2:52:49] <@Solidus_113> Project Cars?
[2:52:49] <jorniev> this is important
[2:52:51] <%KennyKRool> @youngking_kush Okay cool. I dont keep up on labels so it makes sense Im out of the loop.
[2:52:53] <tenshi_q> Dirt is a cool car game
[2:52:53] <+0neReeler> this forza is like casual openworld
[2:52:53] <shooziii> Gran Turismo has VR
[2:52:56] <%JetpackMcQuack> cars are cars
[2:52:58] <%fat_burtreynolds> driving a real car is more fun
[2:52:58] <TonutWasTaken> forza is arcade grant turismo is sim
[2:53:01] <pi_in_the_sci> YES
[2:53:07] <Darmanimon> some are sim some are arcade
[2:53:09] <pi_in_the_sci> THAT'S PURE WRONG
[2:53:11] <+dekkitout> Simulation vs arcade
[2:53:12] <dai_tonight> @TonutWasTaken No, Forza is both. Forza HORIZON is arcade.
[2:53:13] <%zephyboi> Rocket Leage is the most realistic, woolie
[2:53:13] <dds333a> Gran Turismo was mindblowing on ps2
[2:53:14] <+eddi401> What is the rally drifting game called?
[2:53:14] <+impressionistcowboy> arcade vs sim
[2:53:15] <T_Sasquatch> Racing games are cool but im not paying 60 bucks for them
[2:53:15] <TonutWasTaken> forza is arcade racing game
[2:53:15] <%Lancaster_H> @dds333a you're not alone mate i see you
[2:53:16] <%JetpackMcQuack> game feel changes
[2:53:16] <%cubbywolf> forza isnt very realistic
[2:53:16] <raymeats> in fairness gran turismo hasn't had a main line game in 8 years.
[2:53:16] <Darmanimon> just play Cruisin Blast
[2:53:17] <+zangetsu_114> Need for Speed Carbon was my fav
[2:53:18] <pet_purple_panda> Forza is arcadey
[2:53:19] <Equirah> no, there's sim and arcade racing
[2:53:19] <+dekkitout> Forza skirts the line
[2:53:20] <raknikmik> Forza has no VR
[2:53:20] <+Logan_Jennings1> I wish I liked driving/racing games.
[2:53:22] <MikeyxStyles> @moobot what if we all shout?
[2:53:22] <+Posh_Cat> Forza horizon is very arcady compared to tge rest of the series
[2:53:24] <Arqartur0> @TonutWasTaken I read that as Simp XD
[2:53:25] <+KilogramHours> who dat
[2:53:25] <studleydoorite> I feel like if you play a lot of them the difference would be pretty obvious
[2:53:25] <+0neReeler> GT is the only one used by racers since it's a sim
[2:53:27] <+RiverKing13> Forza is arcade
[2:53:27] <+impressionistcowboy> if arcade very very different games
[2:53:31] <+kyun_dere> forza horizon is arcadey
[2:53:31] <dai_tonight> Forza has realistic driving which is my least favorite part of it tbh
[2:53:32] <+KilogramHours> Oh this guy
[2:53:39] <+kyun_dere> motorsport is more sim
[2:53:40] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you micromanage all aspects of the car in gran turismo
[2:53:41] <plumpshiny> Forza is just arcadey enough to be fun
[2:53:41] <Captbutt> whomst
[2:53:41] <dai_tonight> forza motorsport is realistic af
[2:53:42] <LoudmicRPG> @WoolieVersus Gran Turismo always been the realistic one
[2:53:42] <+KilogramHours> 10 Chambers
[2:53:43] <BigAsterisk> Horizon is arcading but you can easily make it a sim
[2:53:45] <jorniev> Yeyeyee
[2:53:46] <+robertoszek> Forza "Motosport" is the sim one
[2:53:46] <%fat_burtreynolds> CAAAW
[2:53:46] <Nocturnment> GT sport is racing sim esport
[2:53:47] <+azure_rivers> He makes music no ?
[2:53:48] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:53:49] <mortalmanbaby> @dai_tonight its extremly not realistic
[2:53:50] <Solidnick18> OH
[2:53:50] <+WarDogOnTheBeat> Forza is arcade but it can be very realistic if you want it to be it has a nice variance
[2:53:50] <%NeedlesD> Forza Horizon is a far more arcadey game, open world
[2:53:50] <%fozzle_> guy who plays zero games in a genre comments on entire genre
[2:53:51] <+Jiggisnipe> he did the 3rd Strike Online too
[2:53:52] <%cubbywolf> youu
[2:53:52] <youngking_kush> They need 5o bring Burnout back fuck the BS lol
[2:53:56] <%Lancaster_H> payday 2 ost also fucks
[2:53:56] <Aussie_Manny> There is a market for both arcadey and and realistic racers.
[2:53:56] <+vaderxyz1970> This guy looks like washed up cliff blizinksy
[2:53:57] <+nial_evol> his music is dope
[2:53:59] <+runegod20> he does the payday soundtrack, at least most of the songs from the series
[2:53:59] <dai_tonight> @mortalmanbaby The driving?
[2:54:00] <thatoneguy066> did they give an accessability award to SIGN LANGUAGE IN A RACING GAME!?
[2:54:03] <jorniev> THAT SONG
[2:54:03] <%kewlmyc> Dude seems nervous
[2:54:03] <Ashenik1> If you want realistic driving experience get  BeaNG
[2:54:04] <dds333a> Killt's chambers
[2:54:06] <Kungfuski> Keep gatekeeping in videogames
[2:54:07] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Payday 3?
[2:54:08] <%cubbywolf> even with the options you can pick it still is arcade
[2:54:10] <+samuraiknack> Seriously can someone just absolutely wedgie Geoff live
[2:54:11] <jorniev> ALSO PAYDAY 2
[2:54:13] <+0neReeler> yes
[2:54:13] <CrazyJake007> He made most of the songs in Payday 2

[2:54:18] <pet_purple_panda> Payday 2 Music
[2:54:24] <emptyantics> Gatekeeping Videogames for everyone

[2:54:38] <dai_tonight> @mortalmanbaby Admitedly I wouldn't be able to tell you, since i haven't played a sim, but it does feel more "realistic" than other car games.
[2:54:40] <BwdYeti> when minh is out robbing banks

[3:33:42] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> xenoblade in the first direct of 2022 right? FeelsBadMan
[3:33:43] <DedlokPM> I'm telling ya. the entire hub-bub about the chrono cross thing was the Another Eden game crossover.
[3:33:47] <%ennui_on_me> Invent your own expectations to get disappointed at
[3:33:50] <agadejobi> Maybe they should have made Chrono Cross good next time
[3:33:51] <dds333a> Guillermo was best guest LUL
[3:33:51] <%specters_art88> The reveals where really boring this year.
[3:33:53] <+Logan_Jennings1> BOOO FUCK CROSS
[3:33:54] <%Irridium> real hope P4U has rollback
[3:33:55] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> not even cross remaster showed up what waste of time
[3:33:57] <pricklypissant> You guys ready for David Cage to save Star Wars?
[3:33:57] <+Jiggisnipe> @DedlokPM ikr
[3:33:58] <%neraren> So Woolie, are you glad you streamed? Was Reggie right?
[3:34:02] <@Solidus_113> Show Reggie the elden ring gameplay trailer
[3:34:03] <+xii_ACE_iix> I'll believe it when I se it
[3:34:04] <astrofalcon1> it was actually chrono trigger
[3:34:04] <blue6sub6remnant6> XENOGEARS remake for my birthday next year, right Woolz?
[3:34:06] <mothdude> So glad about Persona 4 Ultimax coming back
[3:34:11] <Kghaleon> What a joke show
[3:34:15] <@Solidus_113> ULTIMAX THO
[3:34:16] <jorniev> GUILLERMO Was the best guest
[3:34:17] <Overloard> how about that sonic trailer tho
[3:34:18] <youngking_kush> David Cage gonna save Star Wars with Omikron
[3:34:20] <miucsa51> CHRO CROSS SUCK LMAO
[3:34:22] <alrobot2014> but tokyo game show is september?
[3:34:23] <$mattynezz> The mobile game cross-over announcement literally says "the Chrono Cross remaster"
[3:34:25] <ghostofkombatjunkee> no cap
[3:34:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus can we watch the devil trigger performance
[3:34:26] <jorniev> OH YEAH ULTIMAX
[3:34:28] <%JetpackMcQuack> still in my head
[3:34:30] <Arqartur0> Woolz, you may not have gotten Chorno, but, you got Persona 4
[3:34:31] <Hammatime8> No Bomb Rush trailer? 0/10
[3:34:32] <kazadaz> I mean there was SOME good stuff in there, I've seen way worse shows
[3:34:32] <linxonia> Chrono Cross announcement more likely than Silksong
[3:34:33] <+Jiggisnipe> I don't think it would get a big announcement
[3:34:34] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> and fuck atlus smt v isn't even a month out and they went back to milking persona
[3:34:35] <dai_tonight> so who's gonna watch the kanye concert stream?
[3:34:37] <MKII> definitely not
[3:34:37] <%notsoy> NO ROLLBACK THOUGH
[3:34:39] <+wmeldrum> 0 mention of rollback on the website
[3:34:39] <w_khan> it was under "games that will never be done: Chrono Trigger/Cross"
[3:34:40] <dds333a> LUL
[3:34:40] <$mattynezz> No rollback
[3:34:40] <%Irridium> hope it's got rollback

[3:34:42] <Mrthefro> i had agood time
[3:34:44] <Saltmeisterr> no rollback

[3:34:48] <Broand> It's got Denuvo though
[3:34:49] <turtlespence> DAMNIT IT BETTER HAVE ROLLBACK
[3:34:50] <%cubbywolf> we do t know means no
[3:34:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm willing to bet money there's no rollback
[3:34:50] <anthropomorphictempest> monkey's paw LUL
[3:34:53] <+GlennFroggington> That show sucked.  When Alan Wake 2 and a niche Warhammer 40K game are the two most newsworthy trailers that's a terrible show
[3:34:53] <DaKnightWarrior> TELL US ATLUS
[3:34:54] <%JetpackMcQuack> still better than death, but
[3:34:55] <SofterCrash> they'll have to talk about it RIGHT?

[3:34:56] <odd_slater> I HIGHLY doubt it's not gonna have rollback lol
[3:35:00] <alphalejandro> K9999 X Nameless tho
[3:35:02] <+vaderxyz1970> We have Parsec
[3:35:03] <astrofalcon1> buy ultimax so that we can have p5 ultimax
[3:35:06] <youngking_kush> BLITZ NETCODE OR BUST
[3:35:06] <%brisk_dacat> I‚Äôm hype space marines 2
[3:35:07] <@Menitta> the steam page doesnt mentiion rollback
[3:35:08] <rd_sp> arc sys
[3:35:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> Have you learned
[3:35:08] <T_Sasquatch> I should stop watching events
[3:35:09] <@Solidus_113> Ultimax confirmed for Parsec
[3:35:14] <amiavamp> you could apply that logic to all the CG-only trailers as well
[3:35:15] <Aussie_Manny> So my biggest pop tonight was for the Sonic 2 movie trailer, and Woolie's soul leaving his body at Quantic Dream's logo.
[3:35:16] <+KirbyAutomata> SO MANY GUNS
[3:35:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> maybe they don't know
[3:35:19] <+saltpiggu> theres no chance it doesn't ave rollback

[3:35:57] <+AaronR0d> Woolie you do know about the Chrono Cross mobile crossover with Another Eden?
[3:35:57] <Solidnick18> haven't seen it
[3:35:58] <@Menitta> Like...why wouldnt it have it now
[3:36:02] <mothdude> Oh right, Ultimax had a balance patch in Arcades that never made it to consoles.
[3:36:05] <%JetpackMcQuack> i trust it to work if they try
[3:36:05] <shooziii> BLITZNETCODE $ LIFE!
[3:36:07] <Solidnick18> They ported it
[3:36:12] <Solidnick18> and said fuck off

[3:48:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> There is no coming back from it. How it should be
[3:48:13] <Aussie_Manny> Nier: Automata does it right.
[3:48:14] <dds333a> It has consequences
[3:48:15] <w_khan> But the writters for Nier actually care for the story
[3:48:17] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> UGH Ending E destroyed me

[3:48:29] <amiavamp> Nier actually has a message and a theme and sticks with it
[3:48:29] <roboyuji> Yeah you can undo it tho
[3:48:30] <astrofalcon1> freedom is just dlc
[3:48:31] <Papa_Bearman> The Matrix Awakens tech demo is kind of nuts in its scope.

[3:48:33] <%cubbywolf> Max is playing that matrix experience game LUL
[3:48:33] <Darmanimon> yeah but that same person wanted to delete your character in FFXIV

[3:48:34] <T_Sasquatch> @hammatime8 yes but you have to go out of your way to do that
[3:48:35] <+starlorb3> @WoolieVersus  Yoko Taro wanted to make his FF XIV raid deleter your character
[3:48:38] <youngking_kush> The enemies are so boring tho
[3:48:40] <+ttvp> I wouldn't call it "exactly the same" in scope lol, but I understand
[3:48:45] <+dekkitout> @Goku01899 David confronts the legacy of the Zygerrian Empire

[3:49:03] <T_Sasquatch> @darmanimon id let a person die IRL before i do that
[3:49:04] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Minh saying he felt that heartfelt moment hurts how much he likes Detroit LUL
[3:49:11] <%Irridium> oh god the gunguns are going to be the black-people stand-ins aren't they
[3:49:13] <Darmanimon> @T_Sasquatch I know right LUL
[3:49:14] <Hydrapissed> HE watched ghost in the shell for 5 seconds and went I CAN DO THAT and my god its sooo hacky lol
[3:49:14] <FrostedZaibatsu> Whats better this robot game about race or Robot game with fat asses??
[3:49:14] <Hammatime8> @T_Sasquatch Yeah, and it's kinda not official and way better than "LOL U WANT A NEW ROBOT?"
[3:49:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> You know... They could have had the DLC be her posting selfies to your title screen or recorded messages of her seeing different sites. So she's around but because she wants to stay in contact with you?
[3:49:16] <+cermo55> every good thing in a cage game is in spite of him, not because
[3:49:19] <cosmicgoatee> David Maclunky Cage
[3:49:24] <+kaz_questing> Enlightened centrist David Cage
[3:49:32] <youngking_kush> @dds333a Shades? I meant the toy robot guys from Automata
[3:49:32] <+Jiggisnipe> the halfway point of Indigo Prophecy is the hypest shit and you have to see Woolie on the LP, he makes it hyper
[3:49:32] <LeLatte> I hate David Cage so much lol
[3:49:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> DAYUM
[3:49:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
