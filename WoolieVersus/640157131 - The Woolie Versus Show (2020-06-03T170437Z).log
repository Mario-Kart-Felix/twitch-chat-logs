[0:33:36] <$legacy0117> Authority is pretty sh*te to be honest, they are just overgrown children with papers with numbers and words that only exist because no one has burned or destroyed them yet.

[0:34:20] <InfiniteSwagbito> Big V sounds like a cool guy
[0:34:26] <andrei11dr> I had a dude in my highschool that would just go up to cops and smack them, he got expelled later on
[0:34:29] <OldOnyx> problem is that "good cops" are usually ex-cops in training because the system doesn't want them
[0:34:29] <+Xalgar> My best friend is in Law Enforcement and he can't fucking believe what all these cops are doing LUL
[0:34:30] <%Theycallmenerf> V is Dante, V’s dad is Sparda

[0:50:31] <abelincoln_catpuncher> but the feds classified it as a schedule 1 in the US so getting it actually legalized is so hard @woolieversus
[0:50:32] <%Chatterbox1991> THIS is why Legalization is mportant
[0:50:36] <%krispen_wa> legalize crystal weed
