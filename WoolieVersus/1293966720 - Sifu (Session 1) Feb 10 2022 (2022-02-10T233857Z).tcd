[0:00:47] <ToxInjection> I'm so amped baby, get your Kung Fu revenge on, bois
[0:00:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> It looks real good

[0:01:00] <triangularblasphemy> You'll be fine?
[0:01:01] <+Bitscreed> Woolie: "Challenge accepted"
[0:01:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's good, but it ain't easy
[0:01:01] <@Menitta> eh you'll be fine
[0:01:01] <leith_aziz> Shame this game isnt on Steam (EGS). Guess I'll save my money
[0:01:02] <Mr_216> Woolie's gonna Woolie this game
[0:01:03] <%SainEdge> sounds both good LUL
[0:01:04] <Treasure_Vault> woolie will be love destroyed
[0:01:05] <+mechslayer71> I mean, those aren't mutually exclusive
[0:01:09] <a_bald_bro> Its hard as fuck
[0:01:10] <tenshi_q> YEP
[0:01:16] <+TheOlMitcheroo> I think literally both is going to be true
[0:01:20] <Oxybe> Woolie's gonna love getting destroyed by this game.
[0:01:22] <ToxInjection> Yep
[0:01:24] <velgaduere> I think Woolie will in fact have An Experience :)
[0:01:26] <kes009900> after underhood, i think woolie can handle this
[0:01:27] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Its all in the rythem
[0:01:28] <%Prevot> I guess it mean you'll like it but suck ass at it
[0:01:28] <ToxInjection> this shit will humble you LUL
[0:01:31] <%dds333a> Watch Woolie go Zen Mode LUL
[0:01:32] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus you are NOT READY bring your not A game SSS game
[0:01:32] <leith_aziz> pickyFight
[0:01:34] <brunoberserk> BRING ON THE FIGHTS
[0:01:38] <+mechslayer71> not gonna be a button masher like DMC and Bayo. it's smarter than that Kappa
[0:01:41] <majindusto> Arkham  tho lol
[0:01:42] <asakura_ayase> Good ol button basher
[0:01:43] <%dds333a> If he doesn't fail horribly like usual
[0:01:44] <RD_NX> pat did a 3-4 hour stream of it and only got to level 3 and he was old af, games tough
[0:01:45] <Blank9> You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre signing up for (tm)
[0:01:45] <a_bald_bro> It has amazing combat but the camera is ROUGH sometimes
[0:01:47] <exnuart> LITERALLY GODHAND
[0:01:52] <+TreeeFOX> you'll be fine
[0:01:52] <+deadredeyez> that kirby is makeing me uneasy
[0:01:55] <%pugszerosugar> ü•º üß™ for the first half. Then actually gameplay second half.
[0:01:55] <ToxInjection> In-depth beat em ups, lessgoooooo
[0:01:57] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> you'll like this game Woolie
[0:01:58] <%dds333a> no you did not LUL
[0:01:59] <leith_aziz> Well, let's hope you learn on the fly
[0:01:59] <@Menitta> y'know after Tuesday's stream, I think it's foolish to think anything other than Woolie will be fine
[0:02:00] <slipdog> WutFace
[0:02:03] <DXLelouch24> This game puts Arkham to shame
[0:02:04] <@Menitta> lmao
[0:02:08] <zerointelligence000> I really don't see the arkham comparison aside from triangle+circle
[0:02:11] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie liked Absolver
[0:02:13] <tenshi_q> this game straight up Sekiro x Godhand
[0:02:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> @deadredeyez He's watching. Always.
[0:02:13] <spiderously> just FYI, this is NOT ARKHAM COMBAT
[0:02:15] <+TheOlMitcheroo> YOU haven't played Arkham Asylum?? YOUU!?
[0:02:15] <DXLelouch24> It aint Arkham
[0:02:16] <velgaduere> in the end, Woolie will learn, and he will be fine
[0:02:16] <ToxInjection> Not as relevant in this game, luckily LUL
[0:02:20] <niffinbox> arkham is baby stuff compared to this
[0:02:20] <+TheFrancix> it's like if the batman combat and godhand combat had a child
[0:02:24] <velgaduere> this game is closer to Godhand than Arkham
[0:02:27] <+Jiggisnipe> if fact he was one of the few people who was like Absolver tho
[0:02:30] <+deadredeyez> BibleThump
[0:02:30] <demonborntwice> I kinda wish we had a GIFG for Absolver.
[0:02:31] <leith_aziz> @WoolieVersus What was Absolver? Fill me in
[0:02:32] <mihokspawn> Did Woolie play Absolver?
[0:02:33] <slipdog> i loved absolver too, but they straight up abandoned it.
[0:02:40] <masterfire23> punish on whiff
[0:02:46] <brunoberserk> max also streamed it
[0:02:46] <Jerp> absolver's combat was SO good. shame the community imploded and got toxic
[0:02:48] <DSD24> Kahlit Method!
[0:02:56] <+vaderxyz1970> But it doesnt have the Godhand run animation
[0:02:57] <ToxInjection> Oh, it definitely feels that way. I personally love this way more than Absolver.
[0:03:01] <+ResignedBC27> absolver was understand
[0:03:02] <+slidshockingkrow> kahlt gang
[0:03:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:03:02] <demonborntwice> I mean, that's kind of a risk for any martial arts thing.
[0:03:04] <exnuart> absolver suffered from being too ambitious of a social game and having a small playerbase
[0:03:05] <letshavecakes> Oh man, woolie hasn't seen the DLC bruce lee style it got
[0:03:08] <niffinbox> you can see some similarities in move animations they took from absolver and they fused the styles from absolver together basically
[0:03:12] <ToxInjection> but I'm also not a multiplayer guy
[0:03:14] <%dds333a> @vaderxyz1970 the Gene Hustle LUL
[0:03:22] <demonborntwice> Like most of the people who are really vocally into martial arts also think Joe Rogan is the cat's pajamas.
[0:03:28] <Jerp> if I were a big streamer I'd want to try to organize some community matches so everyone can learn and enjoy it without dealing with the toxic people
[0:03:29] <DSD24> Not too mention Stagger style
[0:03:29] <%Zero_Jacks> God Hand?
[0:03:34] <tenshi_q> all thats gone LUL
[0:03:38] <zerointelligence000> this really feels like the devs are getting closer and closer to just making a fighting game with this system
[0:03:39] <DSD24> Drunken Style
[0:03:45] <+brightman42> Sifu doesn't have move list editing though does it?
[0:03:48] <velgaduere> it's almost like it's meant to emulate real martial arts
[0:03:52] <niffinbox> @brightman42 nope
[0:03:57] <+brightman42> dang
[0:03:58] <%dds333a> @zero_jacks the legendary single player action game GodHand
[0:03:58] <slipdog> Absolver had no content, they clearly expected you to mostly do PvP but they refused to balance the pvp in favor of adding paid DLC
[0:04:00] <ToxInjection> @brightman42 no, but you can unlock new moves/combos
[0:04:02] <%dds333a> by Capcom
[0:04:05] <+ResignedBC27> sifu does not have list of moves. different approach
[0:04:07] <Jerp> @DSD24 stagger style was awesome. I got really, really good with it at one point
[0:04:07] <slipdog> was anybody surprised their community was unhappy with them lol
[0:04:12] <+Ornightz> absolver was fun.
[0:04:16] <+ResignedBC27> just a skill tree. its great
[0:04:17] <@Menitta> lol
[0:04:18] <+TreeeFOX> have they confirmed invasions in Elden Ring?
[0:04:20] <+mechslayer71> @resignedbc27 it does, under comboes
[0:04:21] <+Mendin> has Reggie played God Hand?
[0:04:24] <brunoberserk> cool , customizing your moves ... like ''remember me '' , remember THAT game Kappa
[0:04:24] <a_bald_bro> @zerointelligence000 honestly i don't want it, i love the idea of these games like sifu. like the evlution of a beat em up
[0:04:24] <ToxInjection> Windfall all the way ü§ôüèº
[0:04:30] <%dds333a> GodHand is also balls to the wall hard
[0:04:39] <+valiard> Absolved should have been martial arts dark souls with optional pvp
[0:04:40] <ToxInjection> it makes for good practice with the weave dodging in Sifu
[0:04:40] <slipdog> dangOneMore dangOneMore dangOneMore
[0:04:42] <tenshi_q> my one complaint about this game is the skill tree doesnt have many appealing moves to buy
[0:04:48] <Jerp> I actually ended up writing a "move finder" tool for Absolver to make deck editing way easier. The last deck I was using was really well tuned due to that
[0:04:49] <demonborntwice> Kahlt Gang represent!
[0:05:04] <%dds333a> Like Tasky Kappa
[0:05:18] <niffinbox> faejin baby !!
[0:05:20] <DSD24> Kahlit was big strong style
[0:05:23] <+rowegd> That's Rad!
[0:05:24] <%DkLordG> DkLordG subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Excited to see y'all get into Sifu! I was excited the other day to check it out on GamePass, only to find that it isn't on GamePass much less the Xbox. I think I got it mixed up with Trek to Yomi.Have you ever mixed up two upcoming games in your head?
[0:05:26] <letshavecakes> Absolver really was not helped by the dark souls inspirations, the world was so empty and boring, this game has far better environments and aesthetics
[0:05:27] <+brightman42> I loved Godhand and absolver, hybrid heaven also had move editing but it was really fucking weird too
[0:05:33] <brunoberserk> good idea on paper
[0:05:34] <KyberNasse> Imagine a Taskmaster game
[0:05:36] <ToxInjection> Absolver had some rad ideas
[0:05:37] <leith_aziz> I know people like to call Arkham games a babies game, but the appeal of the combat for me was always building a rythm between different enemy types, mixing in special moves and building high combos in quick succession. It's far from my favorite combat type, but for those that make that comparison, that's what they like about it cohhHmm
[0:05:37] <a_bald_bro> it was too niche
[0:05:38] <Louie_Salmon> Is Absolver still around with a community? That seems like a game that doesn't really work without other people
[0:05:47] <%dds333a> Indeed it was
[0:05:50] <scrumbotime> Yeahhhhhh, I actually got the limited run mask bundle when it came out, but just, couldn't get into the online
[0:05:52] <+eanscrale> Oh this is from the absolver devs
[0:05:53] <leith_aziz> Anyway, im way late on the comment, apologies
[0:05:54] <demonborntwice> There are some diehard fans, but like...eh?
[0:05:55] <niffinbox> @Louie_Salmon yeah its still alive
[0:05:55] <slipdog> Sifu shouldve came first, then Absolver would've been less of an ordeal for them from the ground up
[0:06:01] <ToxInjection> Arkham combat is still a ton of fun and looks fantastic. Just different combat from Sifu
[0:06:03] <%emptyantics> Absolver felt too empty for what it was trying to do
[0:06:08] <+ResignedBC27> absolver focused on what was important. combat.
[0:06:19] <%dds333a> It was the main draw, and it showed LUL
[0:06:23] <brunoberserk> @KyberNasse Marvel HIRE this man
[0:06:23] <+ResignedBC27> sifu is amazing
[0:06:27] <%dds333a> to its detriment, in fact
[0:06:27] <+deadredeyez> im high play green hill zone on the kirby sax
[0:06:28] <%X2Eliah> you dont need content and stuff if you have a good fight mechanic.
[0:06:29] <Jerp> @Louie_Salmon community got really small and toxic though. Couldn't really recommend trying it unless you bring a friend and get on your feet w/them. such a shame with how good Absolver's combat system was
[0:06:31] <%andrewofbob> From what I've seen in competitive games, people really struggle to swallow their Ls, which is was a big hurdle for Absolver
[0:06:31] <exnuart> godhand and sekiro are good comparisons
[0:06:32] <demonborntwice> I mean, Absolver laid the foundations for this game.  Imagine if they'd done this game without having a combat base to tune.
[0:06:42] <%X2Eliah> toxic community in a pvp competitive game? noooooooo
[0:06:46] <+slidshockingkrow> as good as the combat is, I think I like the style even more
[0:06:48] <DSD24> Plus I like making cool looking characters in Absolver
[0:06:52] <+Karamsky> yooo!
[0:06:52] <ToxInjection> With Sifu out, now I just need Midnight Fight Express to come out and I'll be good for games for the year VoHiYo
[0:06:56] <demonborntwice> Fabsolver is underrated.
[0:07:00] <%Noonoox12> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[0:07:03] <+mechslayer71> what was that Reggie?
[0:07:06] <demonborntwice> There were so many rad outfits to make.
[0:07:08] <%dds333a> F has two arms Kappa
[0:07:09] <casualshinji> I'd say this is more kung-fu Hotline Miami.
[0:07:11] <Nmiser> Good morning!
[0:07:13] <+Keiyum> Love this game and I hope you both do too
[0:07:13] <leith_aziz> @slidshockingkrow Sifu's artdirection doodOK You know EXACTLY which level im talking about
[0:07:14] <%Reveresao> Good, that way to play was horrible.
[0:07:20] <KeiganOfAstora> Such a weird order you did
[0:07:24] <%dds333a> Woolz did the GOOD order LUL
[0:07:26] <KeiganOfAstora> That was a good idea
[0:07:28] <KeiganOfAstora> I like death passes
[0:07:31] <+brightman42> the turn taking on Bloodborne was what got me into the channel oddly enough
[0:07:33] <%X2Eliah> Gonna be hoenst that controller passof didnt really make for good watching
[0:07:33] <%dds333a> until they stopped doing that LUL
[0:07:37] <%itsrandynewman> itsrandynewman subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:07:37] <KeiganOfAstora> Reggie isn't reayd
[0:07:39] <KeiganOfAstora> ready*
[0:07:40] <%X2Eliah> its beeter to have one person maining
[0:07:42] <+mechslayer71> Reggie doesn't have the build up of skills
[0:07:43] <Deko_> PogChamp
[0:07:44] <+Jiggisnipe> passing the controller was cool
[0:07:48] <thaprinnydood> any quick thoughts on the Nintendo Direct?
[0:07:52] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Jerp
[0:07:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Reggie doesn't have enough XP
[0:07:55] <letshavecakes> Absolver's idea of learning moves by either grinding parries on enemies that use them or grinding the preset loadouts from online player groups was also horrendous
[0:07:56] <0cash> will elden ring be played at launch?
[0:07:58] <Blank9> It‚Äôs less fun for yourself on first play
[0:07:59] <brunoberserk> REggie still a padawan in souls LUL
[0:08:00] <%Bread_Assassin> Death passes really hurt. Led both of them to play obnoxiously.
[0:08:05] <+mechslayer71> that'd a spoil
[0:08:07] <ToxInjection> Reggie just gets to watch a radical Kung Fu flick now LUL
[0:08:14] <+TossuDa> pass the controller sounds cool
[0:08:16] <%emptyantics> Time to punch real hard and real good
[0:08:17] <scrumbotime> Woof
[0:08:19] <Jerp> @X2Eliah eh, it was more than that. Like they got upset if you didn't play how they wanted, use the moves they wanted, and learned how they wanted you to learn.
[0:08:20] <%Lion_kun> Reggie will play when he beats the other games
[0:08:21] <Deko_> LUL
[0:08:22] <Louie_Salmon> Gut-punch death for more time on the clock
[0:08:23] <%Zero_Jacks> Z-target
[0:08:23] <lvl_mania> i don't think it tell you in game but you taunt by pressing right dpad im pretty sure
[0:08:29] <Jerp> @X2Eliah  If you were a streamer especially, you'd get a lot of flak for not "showing off the game in a way that satisfies them". Also their discord wasn't well moderated - even had some people saying some nasty transphobic stuff, questioning peoples' gender identity, etc.

[0:09:04] <veryepicwizard> bro you gotta listen to the podcast
[0:09:07] <velgaduere> no the best part is Reggie not getting it
[0:09:08] <zhenthrim213> nah
[0:09:12] <leith_aziz> @X2Eliah That sounds a lot like if you had a fighting game chat made up of only pros, and of the salty type
[0:09:16] <Linkdude777> Nah, it‚Äôs ok
[0:09:16] <+brightman42> but sharing jokes is nice
[0:09:17] <%dds333a> Patswitchz is still great
[0:09:18] <scrumbotime> We need to form a new form of bit, bits specifically made to confuse Reggie. Imaginary bits.
[0:09:18] <+vaderxyz1970> This is the Podcast part 2 as far as im conserned

[0:09:39] <+kewlmyc> Reggie isn't in the "Cool Kids Club".
[0:09:40] <+Mendin> the observer was able to better see and explain tells and combo timings
[0:09:44] <ToxInjection> Sloclap, give me my Focus Colostomy Bag Attack
[0:09:45] <%Kriss1827> Reggie for podcast
[0:09:46] <Jerp> @X2Eliah that was exactly what it was - the people who no-lifed the game pushed out everyone else
[0:09:46] <leith_aziz> No Steam version pickyPalm
[0:09:51] <Yomamma1337> outer wilds + worlds was tough for me
[0:09:57] <%RyTYoung> Sometimes we are like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need to remember that podcast but here we are ‚Äú Kappa
[0:09:58] <+Catpurnicus> yeah those were pretty bad
[0:09:59] <KeiganOfAstora> I wanna watch this stream but I just got home from work and there are so many things tow atch
[0:10:01] <yukichocomilk> @Yomamma1337 those are the same game to me
[0:10:01] <%dds333a> they sure did

[0:10:05] <leith_aziz> Pls say you played Infamous pickyDrool
[0:10:11] <Deko_> i member alex mercer
[0:10:12] <demonborntwice> Sifu finisher DLC with messed-up names like "Colostomy Bag" and "It's Cloaca Time"
[0:10:12] <letshavecakes> One thing about Sifu that I can never get used to is the lack of a lock-on, which is annoying when combined with directional move inputs
[0:10:14] <%dds333a> And Prototype SUCKED
[0:10:20] <ToxInjection> Outer Worlds/Wilds NotLikeThis
[0:10:21] <+Mendin> the outer w**lds
[0:10:22] <%emptyantics> Outer Wilds or Outer Worlds?
[0:10:24] <+vaderxyz1970> Yah but prototype lets you elbow drop old people form a skyscraper
[0:10:26] <leith_aziz> Allthough, if we're talking Prototype 1, either versions are fine by me
[0:10:27] <BlackermanZX> i liked man surfing in prototype
[0:10:32] <Jerp> @X2Eliah lots of smaller niche games get into that state - "you could hold the world in the palm of your hand if you'd only unclench your fist"
[0:10:35] <+Orbit_Boy> it had a real Bug's Life/Antz energy.
[0:10:36] <exnuart> prototype became bad
[0:10:36] <%dds333a> With movies, we had White House Down and Olympus has Fallen
[0:10:42] <leith_aziz> Oh yeah, Outer Wilds and Outer Worlds

[0:10:44] <+SargentToughie> InFamous 2 is a banger game

[0:10:46] <leith_aziz> Easy to mix up
[0:10:48] <KeiganOfAstora> Outer Wilds is so fucking good
[0:10:51] <%debrv> @dds333a Yeah, but enabled you to FUCKING ELBOW DROP TANKS.

[0:10:57] <+Catpurnicus> "The good space game and the mid space game"
[0:10:59] <ToxInjection> Wish we could have gotten a Prototype 3...I miss it
[0:11:00] <zerointelligence000> oh that one fucked me up
[0:11:02] <+mechslayer71> two rather different movies
[0:11:10] <exnuart> antz was an ex pixar guy though wasnt it?
[0:11:15] <brunoberserk> Antz is cooler , FIGHT ME
[0:11:16] <+protomous> the day woolie plays outer wilds I will cry
[0:11:18] <Louie_Salmon> @keiganofastora He did, technically
[0:11:18] <letshavecakes> I maintain that Antz is the better movie
[0:11:20] <leith_aziz> @ToxInjection Try with Microsoft. you never know
[0:11:22] <casualshinji> Deep Impact - Armageddon
[0:11:23] <+vaderxyz1970> both tonally differnet
[0:11:23] <drunken_lemur> We talking Nidgogg?
[0:11:26] <iacus_> It's usually more common in movies due to how movie scripts circulate in Hollywood
[0:11:28] <+mechslayer71> @protomous he did
[0:11:31] <leith_aziz> Let's consider that in the future cohhNotes
[0:11:33] <yukichocomilk> @letshavecakes it really is
[0:11:34] <slipdog> im gonna play the shit out of those games.. eventually
[0:11:35] <+mechslayer71> only a bit, but he did
[0:11:35] <+Akizea> theres way too much shit coming out rn lol
[0:11:36] <%Prevot> reminder that there's 4 pinocchio movies coming out this year, plus that game too
[0:11:39] <+brightman42> the Paulie shore Pinocchio movie this year and also the Guillermo del Toro one later on, that'll be hilarious
[0:11:43] <Louie_Salmon> That's a big commitment, two long-ass games
[0:11:45] <a_bald_bro> zero dawn is ok
[0:11:48] <+protomous> @mechslayer71 oh shit where
[0:11:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Horizon good games
[0:11:53] <ToxInjection> mood. Never beat the original.
[0:11:53] <VincentGraves> I recommend the first one, you'd like the background lore lol
[0:11:53] <@Menitta> Forbidden West looks like it's gonna be a pain to go back to ZD
[0:11:54] <a_bald_bro> very much so
[0:11:54] <leith_aziz> Open World element
[0:11:55] <slipdog> ubiadjacency
[0:11:55] <+Orbit_Boy> Ubistank
[0:11:57] <WanderingYoren> The Ubi gloss
[0:11:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah...yeah
[0:11:58] <@Menitta> no it's a Far Cry game
[0:12:01] <+mechslayer71> @protomous it's on the channel
[0:12:02] <KeiganOfAstora> What game?
[0:12:03] <%dds333a> The Spirit of Ubi LUL
[0:12:04] <+kewlmyc> You gotta climb towers.
[0:12:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That's exactly why I don't care about it
[0:12:08] <+Zalapski> i'm only just now playing zero dawn and it has a much better feel than ubi games (IMO)
[0:12:08] <@Menitta> it's straight up a Far Cry game
[0:12:08] <KeiganOfAstora> Far Cry Primal?
[0:12:08] <karawra> Yeah you're right
[0:12:10] <%X2Eliah> Horizon is better than an ubi game
[0:12:11] <ToxInjection> It sure LOOKS beautiful.
[0:12:12] <KeiganOfAstora> What game?
[0:12:12] <%Prevot> I tried Horizon and fuckig hated the melee combat in it, bounced off super hard
[0:12:13] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah every episode wouldn't be super engaging
[0:12:14] <+AnIrishPapaya> Ubistank is a GREAT way to put it
[0:12:15] <slipdog> go through the beautiful first are that clearly was from the trailer,
[0:12:16] <%TreeeFOX> yeah. it's a little more interesting than that but I get it
[0:12:21] <KeiganOfAstora> It's not THAT big
[0:12:23] <%Indigo_Automaton> The towers are alive and walk around in HZD LUL
[0:12:24] <@Solidus_113> far cry is still Ubi
[0:12:25] <%cache_22> I did Horizon Zero Dawn and the DLC in like 50 hours. It would make for a long LP.
[0:12:25] <exnuart> its really easy to break the progression
[0:12:27] <urkleturtle> it's a meandering open world game. it's a genuinely great game, but really bad for streaming i'd say
[0:12:30] <brunoberserk> blood dragon is cool
[0:12:30] <@Menitta> It's better than Far Cry but it's open world is the most standard thing you'll ever see
[0:12:31] <Louie_Salmon> Far cry is also Ubi-style basically
[0:12:33] <zerointelligence000> I'm still upset the sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn isn't called One Dawn
[0:12:36] <ToxInjection> I'm just burnt out on open world. I want to avoid open world for a while. I'm burnt out.
[0:12:37] <casualshinji> It all depends on how much you like fighting giant robots.
[0:12:38] <leith_aziz> I'd recommend FC3 and 2 if you want that. Blood Dragon if you love 80 games
[0:12:40] <exnuart> cause all the best stuff is in the shop to buy at the start
[0:12:41] <spiderously> it follows the Ubi Formula
[0:12:43] <@Menitta> I beat it 2 weeks ago lol
[0:12:46] <+kewlmyc> I'd give it a shot if not for KOFXV and Elden Ring coming the same fucking month
[0:12:52] <%Prevot> Far Cry and modern AssCreed are the same game, just one is 3rd person and the other 1st
[0:12:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh man u gotta play FC3 at least
[0:12:58] <jeflakvastskaft> i wouldn't say better
[0:13:00] <a_bald_bro> they definitely did not
[0:13:01] <CrimsonGargoyle> not really they haven't LUL
[0:13:03] <iacus_> Odyssey is basically bootleg Witcher 3
[0:13:08] <StebTheVee> Different but not better
[0:13:10] <sirrice77> Actually some people would say it's gotten worse since the egypt one
[0:13:10] <leith_aziz> I kinda stopped with AC games after Unity and Rogue. ACIV is still my favorite
[0:13:12] <yukichocomilk> but ubisoft is big gross though
[0:13:12] <xerotwo> but ubisoft tho DansGame
[0:13:15] <+mechslayer71> the egypt one was the best one of the open world ones LUL
[0:13:17] <ToxInjection> Don't blame you.
[0:13:18] <%TreeeFOX> for sure. understood.
[0:13:19] <+Bitscreed> Last one I played was Origins and that was enough for me. The Egyptian setting was the main draw for me
[0:13:20] <spiderously> I wouldn't say "improved"
[0:13:22] <+mechslayer71> black flag was the peak tho
[0:13:24] <+DarkNerdShawny> tbh, Elden Ring seems like a ubi game
[0:13:27] <+gatdragon> Why do i hear asscreed NotLikeThis
[0:13:27] <iacus_> Asscreed is STILL not good, but they have got better. A smidge better, gotta admit
[0:13:28] <leith_aziz> Black Flag was great
[0:13:28] <+Karamsky> origins is honestly the only good new age asssasins creed game
[0:13:29] <%X2Eliah> 60
[0:13:31] <Deko_> longer
[0:13:32] <%X2Eliah> minimum
[0:13:34] <+brightman42> 60
[0:13:36] <@Menitta> Zero Dawn took me around 45
[0:13:37] <+eanscrale> Not to even mention the news related to the ubeez
[0:13:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> out of the last 3 I kinda liked the egypt one the most tbh
[0:13:38] <%emptyantics> Cheer500 woolie check out STARFETCHERS, it‚Äôs a 3 hour game that is really neat and has fantastic music and sick artstyle
[0:13:39] <leith_aziz> Ezio trilogy I also love because Ezio
[0:13:42] <%dds333a> Full my dude
[0:13:43] <+mechslayer71> HZD is way longer than 20 yeah
[0:13:44] <AnnoyedApricot> LuL
[0:13:45] <xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[0:13:49] <tenshi_q> after playing odyssey like a week ago‚Ä¶ not really
[0:13:50] <+brightman42> it surprised me
[0:13:50] <CrimsonGargoyle> it's a slog for sure Woolie, not worth it
[0:13:50] <@Menitta> Not quite 60 but yeah
[0:13:51] <ToxInjection> I don't want any more maps that are thousands of kilometers big..
[0:13:54] <exnuart> world is big
[0:13:56] <KeiganOfAstora> 60 hour game is really 120 when LPing
[0:13:56] <karawra> It is quite long
[0:13:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The Horizon monster combat is sick
[0:13:58] <%TreeeFOX> 45 plus the DLC, which feels like Horizon 1.5
[0:13:59] <+anoldtoilet> i just dont like any ass creed games
[0:14:04] <WanderingYoren> time to beat says 30 hours if you main story
[0:14:09] <+kableb> I wanna see you experience FPS eurojank next with stalker
[0:14:09] <dmysta3000> I loved Horizon but I really need to be in a certain mood for those type of game
[0:14:09] <%X2Eliah> horizon is a great game, BUT not good for streaming tbh
[0:14:10] <Luizabd> its not 60 at all
[0:14:13] <+FackuIkari> There's no way it's 60 if you do the story
[0:14:13] <+anoldtoilet> theyre very repetitive and if youve played any of them for 5 minutes youve played all of them for 200 hours
[0:14:14] <+Orbit_Boy> I can totally understand being burned out on Horizon. I fell off because it started to get that "UbiStank"
[0:14:19] <velgaduere> LMAO
[0:14:20] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:14:21] <Deko_> LUL
[0:14:23] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[0:14:24] <ToxInjection> That's a Persona playthrough
[0:14:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> I got about halfway through HZD and lost interest in favour of playing AssCreed Origins
[0:14:26] <%SainEdge> LUL
[0:14:26] <Treasure_Vault> 3 hour game
[0:14:31] <slipdog> Siri play Pledge of Demon
[0:14:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:14:32] <@Menitta> Forbidden West looks to be improving on all the issues I had with ZD which is nice

[0:18:28] <bassoontyphoon> Hi everyone!
[0:18:36] <slipdog> genuine question, is prebuilt companies buying up GPUs en masse during the shortage and upcharging wildly not scalping?
[0:18:39] <leith_aziz> @bassoontyphoon Hi! pickyWave
[0:18:46] <velgaduere> @Demoli_PT no his cohost is this Artesian Builds graphic
[0:18:47] <+brightman42> I went from working at a movie theater to a sandwich shop, accidentally said "enjoy your movie" and they were all "how did you know we were going to the movies after this?!"
[0:18:51] <%sporeian94> SIFU looks cool, can't wait to play it in 2 years after it comes to steam at an affordable price
[0:19:04] <iacus_> @slipdog fits the definition of scalping, so yeah?
[0:19:05] <+Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus are you playing kof15 next week? if so what platform?
[0:19:11] <leith_aziz> It not being on Steam is already the issue for me pickyPalm
[0:19:13] <%RyTYoung> So‚Ä¶chat have @woolieversus and Reggie finished Everhood? Didn‚Äôt catch the streams of them playing it

[0:22:28] <user_naim> can‚Äôt wait for the cable to dc
[0:22:32] <+Jiggisnipe> @Menitta lol
[0:22:33] <%andrewofbob> I've not observed controller lag; should I go wired too?
[0:22:33] <KeiganOfAstora> You guys, bluetooth and USB are close enouogh
[0:22:34] <masterfire23> eliminating johns
[0:22:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> also when Pat streamed it there was controller audio so might look into that
[0:22:41] <KeiganOfAstora> USB isn't gonna be that different
[0:22:43] <+sundayafternoon1> Doesn‚Äôt it have more lag wired on ps4?
[0:22:43] <leith_aziz> Me who plays wired all the time because of PC and not knowing how to use Bluetooth, im 10 steps ahead of you pickySmug
[0:22:45] <+jaayro> i found that punishing is a better descriptor for this game than hard what yall think
[0:22:47] <+mechslayer71> I LLAAAGGGEEEDDD
[0:22:48] <iacus_> input lag?
[0:22:52] <+JayCWayC> The No Johns Universe

[0:23:03] <Estuko> @andre11dr yes
[0:23:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> all kinds of waves and frequencies
[0:23:03] <KeiganOfAstora> I've never had input lag with bluetooth on the PS4 or PS5. This is a HUGE misconception
[0:23:04] <%andrewofbob> So, Woolie is too gamer?
[0:23:07] <+ResignedBC27> theres no lag the responsiveness is so good.
[0:23:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> freqin and vibin
[0:23:08] <@Menitta> it has more lag on PS4 via wired. dunno about PS5
[0:23:11] <KeiganOfAstora> There's no lag dude
[0:23:11] <linSP> I love me some sifu on rice
[0:23:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT THE CONTENT WOOLIE
[0:23:17] <+agnetj> It is. Timing can be tight sometimes with dodging attacks
[0:23:19] <zerointelligence000> "I slow clapped when I saw it"
[0:23:20] <KeiganOfAstora> Wired is usually more lag on PS4
[0:23:21] <leith_aziz> I hear it as Si-foo. Si as in yes
[0:23:21] <bentobeatdown> it's less timing/lag and more directional awareness
[0:23:24] <+valiard> Sifu? more like Jobber Kappa

[0:53:56] <+TheFrancix> ROUGE LITE
[0:53:57] <+toastybites> think of it as saving your best run
[0:53:57] <+ghostfaceninja_> yep, runs
[0:54:02] <drunken_lemur> Rouge lite?
[0:54:08] <OblivionSword1> guess what it's a lite rogue lite
[0:54:09] <thebalticguy1> RUN OF A LEVEL
[0:54:10] <tenshi_q> Runs of a *level*
[0:54:10] <PKHTjim> Rogue-lite.
[0:54:19] <Colby_DJ> Non-random RougeLITE
[0:54:20] <%crybirb> no there isnt
[0:54:21] <scempriss> You have to spend more xp to permaunlock skills
[0:54:21] <+brightman42> that's what it is so yeah
[0:54:22] <kes009900> @WoolieVersus you can Taunt to raise your score multiplayer, this is important.
[0:54:22] <Treasure_Vault> You ain't gonna do it in one
[0:54:24] <bentobeatdown> rogue lite yeah
[0:54:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yuuuuuup
[0:54:27] <tenshi_q> YEP
[0:54:28] <pepinillomaton> "Perfect the run" the game
[0:54:29] <demonborntwice> Perfect your fighting style.  Go.  Begin.
[0:54:29] <+Javaa01> You will not clear all 5 levels in one run on your first go
[0:54:31] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @thebalticguy1
[0:54:31] <+Fabpsi_> it is not rogue like when it comes to the random part. So no random stuff there - but boy is it fun
[0:54:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Runs Per Level
[0:54:32] <%notsoy> it's only on game over
[0:54:32] <%crybirb> theres no generative elements or drops
[0:54:33] <+CrimKangaroo> do a run and 90% of your questions will be answered.
[0:54:36] <%dds333a> @drunken_lemur yeah, this parlance is used for lesser rogulikes
[0:54:38] <%elderpunch> maybe its a bit more like katana zero??
[0:54:39] <+Javaa01> It's just Sekiro
[0:54:40] <+rafaelba93> you learn from repetition
[0:54:44] <ToxInjection> Indeed
[0:54:45] <casualshinji> You should see runs as training. Cuz your gonna need it.
[0:54:49] <%Prevot> ah yes, the Rogue'em up genre
[0:54:50] <hermit427> so is like the overall goal to do a run without aging as much?
[0:54:51] <%dds333a> They don't have the elements of a full Roguelike
[0:54:51] <%Deasmeister> sekiro
[0:54:54] <+rafaelba93> its posture
[0:54:54] <%X2Eliah> so basically, try each mission with least amounts of deaths / years-aged
[0:54:56] <ToxInjection> The levels are meant to be replayed to get them perfect
[0:54:58] <raikagelord1> Avoid is really helpful.
[0:55:05] <thebalticguy1> SEKIRO POSTURE
[0:55:12] <SheepGetGud> the stages dont change between runs but you can go different routes after you get items
[0:55:15] <%crybirb> its beat n up with upgrades
[0:55:16] <+ResignedBC27> @toxinjection yes
[0:55:16] <+RahkshiLord> It's not really a roguelike run, your upgrades from previous levels carry over, you don't really lose progress like it implies outside of not fully unlocked skills
[0:55:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @hermit427 yeah, to get to a new stage at the lowest age possible
[0:55:18] <pepinillomaton> You also recover structure by staying still
[0:55:24] <%X2Eliah> yknow this is a lot like Hitman
[0:55:26] <ToxInjection> I've still yet to do the first level deathless... shit's hard.
[0:55:40] <hermit427> ok thanks @KosOrSomeSayKosm_
[0:55:41] <thebalticguy1> buy skill 5x to permunlock
[0:55:45] <%crybirb> @ToxInjection the boss low hit is kinda bs tbh
[0:55:46] <niffinbox> buy it once then buy it 5 times for perma
[0:55:46] <+ResignedBC27> i got the platinum already
[0:56:03] <+puffinup> there are some skills that are just worth getting immediately for cheap
[0:56:04] <Djazo7> @ToxInjection  i got 3 levels deathless game to addicting
[0:56:09] <ToxInjection> @crybirb oh, every fucking time. That, and his push/side kick always gets me
[0:56:09] <HotSauceFiend> @resignedbc27 how many hours did that tske t
[0:56:14] <scempriss> You can parry Gaurdbreaks
[0:56:14] <pepinillomaton> Sekiro red kanji
[0:56:17] <HotSauceFiend> take to get*m
[0:56:17] <+CookieCutter007> throws are fucked up in this game
[0:56:20] <Awesome_Leaf> guardbreak is haki
[0:56:22] <%X2Eliah> limb glow -> dodge the f... out
[0:56:24] <+Javaa01> MGR orange attacks, so no blocks, only parry or dodge
[0:56:29] <Djazo7> @HotSauceFiend it take like 20 hours or less
[0:56:32] <HotSauceFiend> typing with rubber gloves om is hard
[0:56:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:56:39] <%crybirb> @ToxInjection me too, its what kills for me, i dont know how people can react to that consistently
[0:56:42] <%emptyantics> This game is just Melee Sekiro
[0:56:54] <+RahkshiLord> you CAN block guardbreak attacks you just take a ton of posture damage
[0:56:54] <raikagelord1> @emptyantics yes
[0:56:56] <Darkdrill> The game wants you to be a master GlitchNRG PowerUpR
[0:56:58] <DXLelouch24> i got to 21 at level 1,23 at level 2, currently almost done with level 3(nearly beat boss before watching stream)
[0:57:03] <TigerClaws12> the spot dodge
[0:57:04] <%dds333a> @hotsaucefiend I concur. I know exactly how that feels
[0:57:12] <spiderously> SIFU TIME
[0:57:19] <+ResignedBC27> to platinum maybe 5hrs i took my time just fighting at first. becoming a beast at it. it doesnt take long. i can see someone platinum it within a day.
[0:57:22] <Hammatime8> It's like the avoid thing in absolver
[0:57:24] <ToxInjection> I love that in Sifu, parrying isn't the answer to everything
[0:57:33] <%dds333a> Get Dizzy
[0:57:33] <WanderingYoren> the question is....how hype does this game look when suhni legend plays
[0:57:33] <ToxInjection> use your whole move list!
[0:57:36] <tenshi_q> it slows down the enemy specially, its kinda misleading
[0:57:49] <%hax_metatron> I mean it's just Sekiro with Absolver
[0:57:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Internalize that you Can Give up instead of Aging
[0:57:52] <spiderously> interact with the training dummy
[0:57:57] <+ResignedBC27> windfall style in sifu
[0:58:01] <%Namillus> Ohhhh, keys on the intel board? That's sick, open shortcuts for later attempts
[0:58:12] <tenshi_q> 90% of this game is GIT GUD
[0:58:14] <pepinillomaton> hey, bets on how old will he get after the first level?
[0:58:23] <+Kavtech> @pepinillomaton 30
[0:58:25] <%CasualSpud> CasualSpud subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:58:25] <WanderingYoren> 40
[0:58:27] <+toastybites> 30
[0:58:29] <ImPrettyBadAtTheGame> woolie will be mid 30s
[0:58:30] <+Mendin> 27
[0:58:31] <Djazo7> the only thing this game needs is more levels
[0:58:32] <zhenthrim213> 26
[0:58:37] <Pookiedaexzile> 23
[0:58:37] <%elderpunch> @pepinillomaton 60
[0:58:38] <pepinillomaton> 30
[0:58:39] <ToxInjection> and all these boss characters have sick designs, music is rad, environments are sick to fight in. Sloclap done good.
[0:58:41] <%Bread_Assassin> Early 30s
[0:58:41] <kes009900> where's the taunt button?
[0:58:45] <+Bitscreed> 28.
[0:58:47] <tenshi_q> yall got too much confidence in woolie LUL
[0:58:48] <DXLelouch24> ideal age for level 1 and 2 is in your 20s cause the boss is the main problem in level 3
[0:58:53] <Awesome_Leaf> 28
[0:58:55] <Plughead_> 3
[0:58:55] <Grave_Titan_D> is this a God Hand?
[0:58:56] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Focus is Godhand Roulette moves
[0:58:57] <+Mendin> @kes009900 I think it's select
[0:58:57] <DXLelouch24> cause you can skip ALOT of stuff in 3
[0:58:59] <FrozenPockets> Taunt Button is D Pad Right
[0:58:59] <+ResignedBC27> certain combos can start with a light hit then heavy
[0:58:59] <niffinbox> @kes009900 right on d pad
[0:59:02] <+mechslayer71> just so all you guys know, it's not as simple as one death equals 1 year
[0:59:12] <tenshi_q> @Grave_Titan_D SEKIRO GODHAND
[0:59:12] <user_naim> 28
[0:59:13] <DXLelouch24> yes it goes up
[0:59:17] <OblivionSword1> he'll get atleast 40 years
[0:59:23] <%Namillus> @mechslayer71 Yeah it's exponential
[0:59:24] <FrozenPockets> Taunt Button most important Wollie button
[0:59:26] <Awesome_Leaf> 1 death = your current death counter of years
[0:59:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:59:27] <Madinki> I predict he‚Äôll get to his 40‚Äôs by the end of the first level
[0:59:30] <+Fabpsi_> 2, 4 ,8, 16
[0:59:30] <Djazo7> @tenshi_q i got to much confidence in any one who can play godhand LUL
[0:59:31] <pepinillomaton> yeah, if you keep dying to the same enemy, it grows
[0:59:33] <iacus_> death teaches you skills
[0:59:34] <Shygster> Female Gohan
[0:59:35] <SheepGetGud> the training dummy behind you is a training room
[0:59:37] <kes009900> @kes009900 weird how they dont mention it there. its super important.
[0:59:41] <+toastybites> glass bottles in this game are lifesavers sometimes
[0:59:42] <tenshi_q> @tenshi_q fair fair
[0:59:46] <Pookiedaexzile> TRAINING DUMMY
[0:59:49] <bentobeatdown> the lab is behind you
[0:59:50] <moonbearbacon> window for levels
[1:00:00] <+Bailey__Gaming> Dummy is LAB
[1:00:01] <%andrewofbob> The lab is in your head
[1:00:02] <DXLelouch24> the game encourages you to fight as dirty as possible, NO HONOR in this dojo
[1:00:03] <OblivionSword1> TIME TO LAB
[1:00:03] <pepinillomaton> Red void!
[1:00:04] <DXLelouch24> fuck honor
[1:00:09] <ToxInjection> time to check the skill tree! or DO LAB
[1:00:12] <%dds333a> He'll figure it out
[1:00:16] <iacus_> ok so you definitely can't use the dpad... saed
[1:00:19] <+Javaa01> Weapon rack at the back
[1:00:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> hey what's that over there
[1:00:23] <Djazo7> i wish i could change the guy you fight in the lab
[1:00:26] <ToxInjection> here we go
[1:00:27] <+mechslayer71> the lab looks good but unfortunately is slightly eye searing
[1:00:36] <raikagelord1> Weapon rack??? Didn‚Äôt know that was their
[1:00:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> Roulette wheel
[1:00:47] <+Zalapski> nyuk nyuk nyuk
[1:00:48] <+Bailey__Gaming> Dirtyest Player in the game
[1:00:49] <ToxInjection> I dunno, I love the red personally
[1:00:53] <+AWKWARDL0SER> S/O Woolie for playing as a woman always like when people play off of their IRL selves in games
[1:00:59] <ToxInjection> so dynamic and eye-catching
[1:01:02] <%dds333a> @mechslayer71 yeah. the Bayo one had the sense to not be so bright
[1:01:13] <%legacy0117> Eye searing but all you can see is red when you have this much revenge built up inside.
[1:01:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @HentaiIsloveAH
[1:01:27] <+rafaelba93> try your defences, they are VERY important
[1:01:32] <pepinillomaton> You can sweep again for funsies lol
[1:01:33] <%dds333a> @legacy0117 LUL LUL
[1:01:47] <demonborntwice> Yeah, defense is more important when you're surrounded.
[1:01:51] <DXLelouch24> abuse those otgs, abuse the fuck outta those togs
[1:01:55] <+Bitscreed> We're going to be here a while aren't we? :P
[1:01:56] <DXLelouch24> otgs*
[1:02:00] <demonborntwice> Two punches!
[1:02:02] <+ResignedBC27> first hit avoid
[1:02:03] <+AngelYoumou> LAB IS OPEN
[1:02:07] <HotSauceFiend> is that a womans voice or a young boy?
[1:02:08] <+AngelYoumou> !lab
[1:02:09] <%dds333a> @bitscreed AS HE SHOULD
[1:02:10] <demonborntwice> Yes! Spot dodges.
[1:02:12] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> you can parry/dodge during most actions
[1:02:13] <OblivionSword1> there's also a dedicated chase moves after the push that you can unlock
[1:02:14] <niffinbox> did he spot the weapons here?
[1:02:20] <+Bitscreed> @dds333a I would expect nothing less.
[1:02:26] <+mechslayer71> all of this for woolie to get faded in the first level LUL
[1:02:34] <Darkdrill> parry
[1:02:35] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:02:39] <TigerClaws12> EYES
[1:02:40] <pepinillomaton> my eyes!
[1:02:40] <Better__Days> Schoolie
[1:02:41] <Plughead_> avoid is lows and highs
[1:02:42] <ToxInjection> weave-dodging will come clutch if you can get a hang of 8t
[1:02:43] <%emptyantics> MY EYES
[1:02:43] <Djazo7> @OblivionSword1 i can never get the chasing move right
[1:02:45] <yukichocomilk> DARK MODE PLEASE WutFace
[1:02:46] <ovejart> my eyes WutFace
[1:02:47] <Pookiedaexzile> High Low Dodges
[1:02:48] <+TheBitingIrish> Just parry the flashbang
[1:02:48] <%elderpunch> WHITE
[1:02:55] <+Jiggisnipe> light mode users D:
[1:02:55] <AstrodropGaming> GlitchLit GlitchLit
[1:02:57] <KaseKaizer> stripBlind
[1:03:00] <Darkdrill> BatChest  flash bang
[1:03:00] <brunoberserk> SOLAR FLARE
[1:03:04] <%Explodincatz> options maybe?
[1:03:05] <a_bald_bro> idk why they thought white was a good idea
[1:03:05] <majindusto> BLINDED  BY THE LIGHT!!!
[1:03:05] <Grave_Titan_D> eye strike = pocket sand
[1:03:06] <KeiganOfAstora> Imagine pat's TV
[1:03:06] <defaultname3887> every game need nier automata soft browns for menus
[1:03:06] <tenshi_q> Not a real dodge
[1:03:09] <Hammatime8> My eyes jolliBurn
[1:03:10] <user_naim> throwable after certain avoids too
[1:03:11] <%dds333a> FINAL FLASH
[1:03:12] <+rafaelba93> the slow down is after the avoids you were doing
[1:03:18] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Burn that movelist into your retinas
[1:03:20] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> this is like the Ghost of Tsushima menu lol
[1:03:24] <OblivionSword1> @OblivionSword1 yeah the timing is real tight for it
[1:03:28] <Djazo7> low attack is a nightmare for any beginner
[1:03:29] <Darkdrill> im going to put some sand in your eyes
[1:03:29] <letshavecakes> Down avoid will dodge literally every attack other than lows and throws, up avoid is exclusively for lows
[1:03:31] <%legacy0117> Dark mode I neeed! BibleThump
[1:03:38] <cocobody> Imagine going to fight some and watching them WAVE DASH at you like that
[1:03:45] <%dds333a> I'm thankful I'm sitting in a well lit room right now
[1:03:46] <ToxInjection> Huh. Brightness never bothered me that much.
[1:03:47] <Tydemore> wray44EZ
[1:03:52] <demonborntwice> I'd be intimidated as hell.
[1:03:52] <%Indigo_Automaton> @TheBitingIrish The idea of parrying an attack with your eyelids makes me uncomfortable
[1:04:03] <demonborntwice> That means they know something I don't.
[1:04:04] <internetskeletonn> no
[1:04:05] <OblivionSword1> your hp in in the top left
[1:04:08] <TigerClaws12> you lose and it resets
[1:04:09] <OblivionSword1> the white bar
[1:04:10] <a_bald_bro> no that just means you're stagered
[1:04:10] <%dds333a> @toxinjection me neither, but I imagine it could depending on the conditions LUL
[1:04:13] <+rafaelba93> health is upper left
[1:04:13] <BenGarcia8995> If you are surrounded, getting your guard break means death
[1:04:14] <Awesome_Leaf> no its just posture break
[1:04:16] <+Javaa01> Coins are deaths
[1:04:20] <Grave_Titan_D> do I see weapons?
[1:04:21] <+mechslayer71> playing the gam explai s
[1:04:22] <internetskeletonn> you can take damage even when your bar is empty
[1:04:24] <%andrewofbob> Everything has a healthbar, structure is different, like a guard break
[1:04:24] <Pookiedaexzile> It Opens you up for more strikes
[1:04:26] <+puffinup> in the game proper it'll lead to you getting munted
[1:04:27] <+mechslayer71> game*
[1:04:27] <sperium3000> Why do people have so much trouble identifying the health bar in this game?
[1:04:29] <raikagelord1> Just posture break
[1:04:37] <sperium3000> Like I know it's just a plain white bar but context clues man
[1:04:44] <ToxInjection> when the structure breaks, they can just go in and get good hits ib
[1:04:44] <spiderously> parry Woolie, parry
[1:04:58] <sauce_boss_88> It‚Äôs an Avoid game
[1:05:06] <Awesome_Leaf> red parries?
[1:05:06] <+TaifuDragon> you should never have to backdash
[1:05:11] <%X2Eliah> just buy and use a gun
[1:05:12] <+mechslayer71> partying is good against certain enemies
[1:05:12] <ToxInjection> parrying is useful, but it's not the solution to everything
[1:05:12] <TigerClaws12> yea parry isn't as strong as sekiro
[1:05:14] <%dds333a> @sperium3000 it needs a dragon wrapping around it, obviously Kappa
[1:05:15] <internetskeletonn> structure breaking is just like a stun to you all attacks deal damage to you
[1:05:18] <+TaifuDragon> if you're doing it right
[1:05:21] <+mechslayer71> parrying*
[1:05:27] <Yomamma1337> you can square + x after a parry for the throw
[1:05:30] <Djazo7> @sperium3000 i think because yang at the beginning doesn't have a health bar
[1:05:36] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> R2 is more for positioning than evading attacks
[1:05:40] <+JustSoji> what does aging do to you
[1:05:43] <demonborntwice> "I mean, these days you can't go around kicking and punching people because...::mimes taking out a gun::...that's it.  I don't care how good you are!" - Bruce Lee
[1:05:43] <+rafaelba93> you can chain specials mid combo iirc
[1:05:48] <sperium3000> @dds333a And when it gets low it does the pokemon beeping, but it's a gong
[1:05:48] <+toastybites> @JustSoji lower health, higher damage
[1:05:51] <Awesome_Leaf> red parry PogChamp
[1:05:57] <Djazo7> @ElusiveBaikenPlayer or to do a running attack
[1:06:04] <niffinbox> use ya dodges woolie
[1:06:05] <spiderously> there are weapons BTW
[1:06:07] <+Javaa01> @JustSoji And learning new skills get locked out as you age
[1:06:14] <mrtanaka111> 1 hour in still playing the tutorial
[1:06:18] <mrtanaka111> never change woolie
[1:06:26] <%dds333a> the RAGE
[1:06:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[1:06:34] <ToxInjection> to be fair, they gave him a lab. We lost him then.
[1:06:36] <spiderously> you have to parry each hit
[1:06:36] <+KisukeOboro> but blocking increases the structure damage it seems
[1:06:36] <pepinillomaton> @mrtanaka111 "This is the way" - Woolie
[1:06:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Dodge Twice
[1:06:37] <demonborntwice> I mean, this is the meat of it.  You're learning kung fu.
[1:06:41] <%IronOhki> IronOhki subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! Just wanna say thanks for introducing me to Absolver and Sifu. I unironically loved Absolver, but it sure was rough. Happy to see that team grow and make something more people can enjoy.
[1:06:41] <+CheyMix> better they learn now or get their ass beat
[1:06:43] <iacus_> is it like godhand dodge?
[1:06:44] <+CheyMix> this games hard
[1:06:45] <Yomamma1337> parry does more damage but is harder
[1:06:46] <Darkdrill> we labbing :3
[1:06:50] <+toastybites> im surprised he still didnt touch weapons yet
[1:06:52] <LoneFonte> Lab Status: Open
[1:06:52] <mrtanaka111> is one hour enought o learn kung fu?
[1:07:03] <user_naim> the kung fu dimension is where we grow our hearts strong
[1:07:04] <+JustSoji> average fgc streamer
[1:07:06] <spiderously> r1 to throw
[1:07:06] <Hammatime8> Knife? SirSword
[1:07:09] <+mechslayer71> @cheymix he's gonna get minced anyway, this is one guy he's fighting, the game loves jumping you
[1:07:11] <tenshi_q> you can just hold block while dodging right?
[1:07:14] <+TaifuDragon> parry functions like Instant Block you can do it to every hit
[1:07:16] <%legacy0117> BRB. Have fun.
[1:07:17] <+rafaelba93> weapon keeps your moveset
[1:07:22] <Djazo7> knife does more heath dmg then meter dmg
[1:07:24] <SheepGetGud> heavy heavy sweep or palm is really good on most enemies (also worth saying that ive beaten the game with both endings already if you anything explained from someone whos played alot)

[1:12:51] <thebalticguy1> if you get knocked down
[1:12:52] <edward0286> Weapon catch is essential for third boss

[1:16:52] <+Mendin> 3 bars is a TON
[1:16:52] <tenshi_q> tbh alot of these focus moves aren't worth
[1:16:56] <+Catpurnicus> cutting the femoral artery is basically instant death

[1:31:09] <thebalticguy1> not worth giving up yet
[1:31:10] <user_naim> resident pipe respector
[1:31:10] <ToxInjection> yeah like that LUL
[1:31:16] <ohno58> need crowd control
[1:31:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> run ends
[1:31:17] <DXLelouch24> you restart the level
[1:31:17] <+mechslayer71> @elderpunch it stacks
[1:31:17] <exnuart> death is reset
[1:31:18] <+ScottishMadJacko> you go back to the start
[1:31:18] <TheyCallMeVawn> Restart whole level
[1:31:20] <Djazo7> yep
[1:31:22] <+puffinup> skills lock out every decade starting from the bottom
[1:31:22] <thebalticguy1> restart the level at 20
[1:31:23] <DXLelouch24> yes
[1:31:23] <+aishman> You start from the beginning. Also no XP carries over
[1:31:25] <tenshi_q> accepting death is pretty pointless unless you are farming
[1:31:25] <exnuart> run back
[1:31:25] <bentobeatdown> start from zero yeah
[1:31:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ye
[1:31:29] <LoneFonte> no XP too
[1:31:31] <+cubbywolf> you restart with nothing
[1:31:33] <Nohorse> Being old is not so bad LUL
[1:31:33] <leith_aziz> There's an age limit. Once you reach it, game over
[1:31:34] <+Javaa01> Giving up means you go back to 20 and go back to level select
[1:31:35] <+Lord0Mugen> @WoolieVersus EXACTLY as you just said it
[1:31:37] <+rafaelba93> it will be clearer after finishing this lvl
[1:31:37] <+brightman42> keep going
[1:31:38] <DXLelouch24> the goal is to be as young as possible before each stage
[1:31:40] <PKHTjim> That's restarting the level, yea. No point when just starting, yea?
[1:31:41] <+ReefTheWizard> is it a roguelite?
[1:31:41] <Kaji04> finish the level for a practice run
[1:31:44] <bigboy3d> It's your first run ,just keep going
[1:31:47] <thebalticguy1> give up is this run wasnt good enough
[1:31:48] <+Lord0Mugen> @ReefTheWizard no
[1:31:50] <+Crippl3> this is not a roguelike/lite
[1:31:57] <+rafaelba93> STINGER
[1:31:59] <edward0286> You can but you lose all xp
[1:32:01] <+RahkshiLord> you restart the level, not the run, calling it a run is misleading
[1:32:04] <penitentpendant> Shortcut Unlocks are permanent though
[1:32:07] <SheepGetGud> the sweep isnt that great
[1:32:07] <+chiazam> Unlock something
[1:32:07] <thebalticguy1> not worth giving up on your first run
[1:32:10] <tenshi_q> going as far as possible is always the best option
[1:32:10] <ToxInjection> Keep going if you want. Play how you want to.
[1:32:10] <@Menitta> are these skills permanent
[1:32:12] <slix3431> This game is sick
[1:32:13] <SheepGetGud> you can eye poke then manually sweep
[1:32:14] <letshavecakes> It's always worth it to unlock shortcuts and farm xp until you age into dust
[1:32:15] <%andrewofbob> @Crippl3 It's totally a roguelite
[1:32:16] <leith_aziz> Is there a benefit to playing a level with as little deaths as possible? Does you age continue between levels?
[1:32:19] <lanhub14> This game is assssss
[1:32:20] <DXLelouch24> like if you hit 40 this run, but in a rerun you hit 44 you restart cause its a worse run
[1:32:23] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta only if you spend enough EXP.
[1:32:25] <leith_aziz> Or does your age reset between levels?
[1:32:25] <darkodargon> regie looks handsome with his hair slicked back
[1:32:26] <+cubbywolf> offense over defense eh
[1:32:27] <+ReefTheWizard> @Crippl3 more of a hitman mastery type system then?
[1:32:30] <DXLelouch24> @leith_aziz yes
[1:32:33] <+mechslayer71> @leith_aziz continues
[1:32:34] <7c_nickel> you gotta unlock and then invest 5 permanent things to get it permanently
[1:32:36] <@Menitta> Ah cool
[1:32:37] <+tsundingus> it's probably worth it to just keep going until you die
[1:32:39] <a_bald_bro> @leith_aziz you can only start levels at the lowest age you reach them so yes
[1:32:40] <leith_aziz> Good to know
[1:32:52] <%hax_metatron> Age 30 = ACID REFLUX UNLOCKED
[1:32:56] <%dds333a> Took two years to get back here

[1:33:33] <pepinillomaton> He was the coolest guy
[1:33:33] <+rafaelba93> dodge is not as good as parries and avoids
[1:33:35] <+brightman42> but the controller is plugged in!
[1:33:36] <sperium3000> Don't be afraid to attack enemies around you, the combo keeps going even if you switch targets

[1:33:59] <DXLelouch24> @rafaelba93 it is for my build, focus on dodge, otg the fuck outta everyone
[1:34:00] <+aishman> Parrying and hitting
[1:34:00] <pepinillomaton> yes
[1:34:01] <iacus_> whaat
[1:34:01] <a_bald_bro> yes
[1:34:02] <Yomamma1337> yes
[1:34:02] <+cubbywolf> yeah
[1:34:03] <zanzibarian_hamster> Tiger Joe
[1:34:03] <+toastybites> yes
[1:34:04] <LoneFonte> ys
[1:34:04] <tenshi_q> yes
[1:34:04] <pepinillomaton> no
[1:34:05] <thebalticguy1> HES A SPECIAL ENEMY
[1:34:06] <+Catpurnicus> your death counter is how many years you age, right?
[1:34:06] <penitentpendant> Miniboss reduces death combo by one
[1:34:06] <%Zero_Jacks> ye
[1:34:06] <Nohorse> Now you will age a little less if you die
[1:34:06] <Xelhesia> yes
[1:34:06] <+PrefectusCorgi> yes
[1:34:07] <Yomamma1337> no it went down
[1:34:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[1:34:07] <+Kyma1020> no
[1:34:07] <+cubbywolf> it was reduced
[1:34:07] <HeckItsZed> No, it went down
[1:34:08] <+puffinup> yeah
[1:34:08] <a_bald_bro> it went down
[1:34:08] <%Juriasu> no it went down
[1:34:09] <iacus_> you can reduce deathcount ah
[1:34:09] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[1:34:10] <+Crippl3> WOOLIE?
[1:34:12] <sushahana> ?
[1:34:12] <scempriss> special enemies reduce
[1:34:12] <LoneFonte> went down
[1:34:13] <casualshinji> Certain enemies reduce your death counter.
[1:34:13] <+mechslayer71> no it went down to 1
[1:34:13] <exnuart> went down to 1
[1:34:13] <BackflipCharm> You beat a mini boss, which lowers the death counter
[1:34:13] <OblivionSword1> reduced by 1 when you deafeat a bad ass
[1:34:13] <niffinbox> its dodges for structure
[1:34:14] <Xelhesia> down 1
[1:34:16] <+Crippl3> 1 is 1 more than 2 :)
[1:34:16] <+Kyma1020> it means I'd you die only one year is added
[1:34:16] <PKHTjim> The death count penalty went down by one.
[1:34:17] <spiderously> yes, kill a miniboss reduce counter
[1:34:17] <Darkdrill> no every dead ads the number top right
[1:34:17] <user_naim> yes
[1:34:18] <SheepGetGud> when you beat strong enemies it goes down 1
[1:34:18] <iacus_> yo this is very godhand
[1:34:18] <sperium3000> LP TAX IS REAL
[1:34:19] <edward0286> Every death adds to the counter until you kill special enemies to reduce it
[1:34:20] <ToxInjection> and avoiding
[1:34:21] <+brightman42> it go down but age only goes up
[1:34:22] <TigerClaws12> everytime you rise it's current age + death counter
[1:34:23] <a_bald_bro> making progress lowers it
[1:34:23] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus mini bosses reduce the death counter by 1
[1:34:23] <leith_aziz> I assume with more deaths we go 1>2>3 etc...
[1:34:24] <sushahana> it goes down?
[1:34:26] <+chiazam> Successful parries and avoids
[1:34:26] <+Javaa01> Boss enemy takedowns reduce it
[1:34:26] <linSP> no :)
[1:34:27] <DuoScratch> beating bosses and elites reduce it. ;p
[1:34:28] <+El_Rabbit> Killing strong enemies reduces
[1:34:29] <+rafaelba93> use parries and avoids before the dodge
[1:34:30] <+Lord0Mugen> @WoolieVersus Elite deaths make you year counter go down by one.
[1:34:30] <tenshi_q> so you dont age as much when you die
[1:34:30] <JacknZack27> No it went down
[1:34:31] <exnuart> fight your minibosses
[1:34:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[1:34:32] <%andrewofbob> Unsuccessful parry reduces structure AKA a block
[1:34:33] <+Damie904> Your death counter is how many years you'll age when you die. Strong enemies lower the counter when you beat them.
[1:34:33] <CelestialCage> @WoolieVersus the higher the death counter, the more you age. It tells you how much you age after death
[1:34:33] <ToxInjection> so now when you die  you'll only age by 1
[1:34:33] <%SerialSins> No it reduced
[1:34:34] <T_Sasquatch> @iacus_ its really not. It tries tho
[1:34:39] <+cubbywolf> block dodging is a must
[1:34:41] <pepinillomaton> when you kill some badasses, the counter go down
[1:34:44] <SheepGetGud> any time you dodge an attack with l1 and directionals it goes down
[1:34:44] <iacus_> low key godhand spiritual successor
[1:34:45] <Plughead_> not dodging, spot dodging, specifically
[1:34:48] <+aishman> Parrying damages THEIR structure
[1:34:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That pipe looks so bent lol
[1:34:52] <+mechslayer71> parry8ng fucks their structure, like in sekiro
[1:34:53] <+cubbywolf> spot dodging yeah
[1:34:54] <iacus_> @T_Sasquatch let's say "heavily inspired by" then
[1:34:58] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> parrying deals structure dmg to the enemy
[1:34:59] <CelestialCage> It's actually a LOT like the God Hand Demons cuz you do a kill move on a normal dude but the reverse it full heal and turn into a miniboss
[1:35:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Whats Wrong Woolie thought you loved Defensive Maneuvers
[1:35:03] <%livlinn> Hullo woolieCRAB
[1:35:09] <@Menitta> smh the sequel to God Hand is Remember Me Kappa
[1:35:10] <DXLelouch24> OH YEA
[1:35:10] <letshavecakes> Death counter management is the difference between hitting 60 and having one death left before your last, and having 10 deaths left before your last
[1:35:13] <+cubbywolf> look at the glowing message or the fist note
[1:35:13] <LunarRemix> It's just like Sekiro Woolie
[1:35:14] <SheepGetGud> parrying then also makes it your turn to hit
[1:35:14] <%livlinn> !uptime
[1:35:14] <DXLelouch24> your not ready
[1:35:14] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 54 minutes
[1:35:17] <pepinillomaton> oh yes
[1:35:18] <ToxInjection> I believe so. Avoiding is better for lowering the meter
[1:35:20] <%dds333a> @celestialcage indeed
[1:35:20] <HotSauceFiend> isnt that parry structure damage basically like sekiro?
[1:35:20] <Hammatime8> "Avoiding" is different from dodging
[1:35:23] <+rafaelba93> avoid and parry, dodge is not very good
[1:35:23] <DXLelouch24> this feels harder than Sekiro imo
[1:35:26] <+devilmaykyle> you can be a girl?
[1:35:27] <exnuart> more than a couple of times
[1:35:28] <NeonBleu> Gonna be a shit diet
[1:35:29] <%SerialSins> Not dodging, avoiding
[1:35:31] <@Menitta> @dxlelouch24 you're*
[1:35:36] <Wahrow> Time to try courage woolieFROG
[1:35:38] <+Lord0Mugen> @devilmaykyle apparently
[1:35:39] <TopLeftCenter> heavier attacks still make you lose structure even when you get the timing right on the parry, but even if it fills it won't break on a parry
[1:35:39] <T_Sasquatch> @dxlelouch24 ......
[1:35:42] <leith_aziz> Animations on point
[1:35:42] <CelestialCage> @devilmaykyle yeah. you choose after the tutorial
[1:35:42] <ToxInjection> indeed
[1:35:43] <pepinillomaton> avoiding seems the way to go in most cases, parry I think is to do heavy damage
[1:35:44] <+Solid_Stro> Shit will be served and eaten
[1:35:45] <@Menitta> woolieSMUG
[1:35:46] <%emptyantics> but Woolie you said this was a no death/no hit run!
[1:35:51] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> best way to learn is to get your ass kicked
[1:35:53] <+cubbywolf> 2 types of doge
[1:35:54] <SheepGetGud> heavy heavy then push or sweep is great damage and stun
[1:35:56] <leith_aziz> pickyFight
[1:35:57] <%dds333a> @emptyantics woolieSMUG
[1:35:59] <CelestialCage> The male protag gets a cool ass bearrd when he gets older but I like kung fu grandma
[1:36:02] <+devilmaykyle> @devilmaykyle that's cool
[1:36:02] <ToxInjection> but learning from your mistakes is what turns you into a Sifu, young grasshopper
[1:36:04] <exnuart> no hit expert mode
[1:36:04] <mrtanaka111> i love a game that can kick my ass
[1:36:09] <casualshinji> Don't fuck with Lady Patrick Swayze.
[1:36:17] <a_bald_bro> Is sifu a name or a title
[1:36:22] <%dds333a> Don't fuck with Roadhouse LUL
[1:36:22] <leith_aziz> Dont fuck with this Sifu!
[1:36:22] <Yomamma1337> @pepinillomaton parrying is better for most enemies, but for stronger enemies avoiding is better
[1:36:28] <exnuart> @a_bald_bro title
[1:36:28] <mrtanaka111> 2 old
[1:36:28] <ToxInjection> @a_bald_bro Chinese for Master

[1:36:34] <iacus_> oh I like this

[1:36:37] <SheepGetGud> the red ones dont take away score but the xp ones cost xp
[1:36:39] <mrtanaka111> sifu means japanese sword
[1:36:39] <Nohorse> Tier listed rewards LUL
[1:36:41] <DXLelouch24> HP restore IMO is essential
[1:36:42] <CelestialCage> oooh a YOUNG ONLY buff
[1:36:42] <leith_aziz> pickyLurk
[1:36:45] <DXLelouch24> max that asap
[1:36:47] <7c_nickel> @WoolieVersus Important Note, you have 1 bar of focus and it goes up in 1/2 increments
[1:36:51] <kenny_biff> your 20s are vanishing before your very eyes
[1:36:53] <HotSauceFiend> past your prime age
[1:36:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> are these per run or permanenet
[1:36:55] <+aishman> The shrines also heal you
[1:36:56] <T_Sasquatch> Make Sifu simply looks cooler with the addition of a beard as he ages. Female sifu doesn't change much sadly
[1:36:56] <ToxInjection> age restricted upgrades baybee
[1:36:57] <+Javaa01> Too old to use weapons
[1:36:57] <AvroEltz> You cant get this old man
[1:37:00] <TigerClaws12> too old FeelsBadMan
[1:37:00] <leith_aziz> Zoomer privellage
[1:37:02] <Hammatime8> Too old to boost weapon durability :(
[1:37:02] <haitakaa> ok noomer Kappa
[1:37:02] <tenshi_q> already peaking
[1:37:03] <%dds333a> This is how it feels
[1:37:04] <T_Sasquatch> Male sifu*
[1:37:05] <edward0286> Rewards are not permanent unless you keep going
[1:37:06] <+AngelYoumou> HP GAINED ON TAKEDOWN YO
[1:37:06] <CelestialCage> oH YEAH i also need to repeat the first level to choose better statue upgrades cuz i didnt realise how this worked at first
[1:37:06] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @HentaiIsloveAH
[1:37:10] <letshavecakes> only young bucks can learn how to not break things by beating people with them
[1:37:10] <leith_aziz> pickyOld
[1:37:13] <SheepGetGud> the red ones dont take away score but the xp ones cost xp
[1:37:13] <+Lord0Mugen> @WoolieVersus you lost the ability to buy Weapon Durability
[1:37:20] <Yomamma1337> @Lord0Mugen yes he knows
[1:37:20] <+johnnychopsocky> each decade also changes the taunt
[1:37:23] <%dds333a> Times pass you by, and you can't do the things you used to anymore
[1:37:25] <+aishman> @woolieversus Just FYI. That's the only way to increase your focus bar
[1:37:29] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you got too old and cant get durability now
[1:37:30] <ToxInjection> @johnnychopsocky WAIT WHAT
[1:37:34] <+cubbywolf> gotta master avoid before you can master dodging
[1:37:37] <+johnnychopsocky> YEP
[1:37:37] <+rafaelba93> age ones
[1:37:38] <%legacy0117> Basically the game encourages you to get guud, rather than just yell it at your face.
[1:37:39] <pepinillomaton> That is pretty baller
[1:37:47] <%legacy0117> woolieGASM
[1:37:50] <SheepGetGud> health gained is really good
[1:37:51] <DXLelouch24> essential
[1:37:52] <+rafaelba93> heath
[1:37:53] <iacus_> go for survival
[1:37:53] <ToxInjection> I never knew this. Oh man, I love this game dude
[1:37:55] <PKHTjim> HP recovery feels important.
[1:37:56] <Nohorse> Long term
[1:37:57] <tenshi_q> probably the best one
[1:37:58] <DXLelouch24> max it stage 1
[1:38:00] <+Lord0Mugen> restart run! LUL
[1:38:07] <tenshi_q> that and the third score one
[1:38:08] <SheepGetGud> the chasing sweep is also really good
[1:38:08] <+chiazam> HP recovery is important
[1:38:10] <+johnnychopsocky> Right on d-pad is taunt.  Taunts boost your multiplier
[1:38:10] <%dds333a> Chosen
[1:38:15] <SheepGetGud> it lets you combo push into a knockdown
[1:38:28] <a_bald_bro> the dark dots = can afford and are the age to unlock
[1:38:28] <@Menitta> It encourages you to die less than actually bang your head against a wall with "git gud"
[1:38:28] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> i wish health regain wasn't the only option that makes sense
[1:38:29] <%jepupu> This game better be in the next SGDQ
[1:38:29] <7c_nickel> You might want to invest the perm unlock
[1:38:35] <letshavecakes> When you're young, you taunt by intimidating or challenging enemies- when you're old, you taunt by patronizing your enemies
[1:38:36] <7c_nickel> they carry over
[1:38:36] <user_naim> i think we‚Äôre getting A BIT backseaty here guys
[1:38:39] <+johnnychopsocky> To get big score, you must first clown on fools
[1:38:39] <SolidusA> remove amount of nose bleed upon successful avoid
[1:38:42] <+aishman> Just FYI Woolie. The shrine is the only way to increase your focus bar. So if you wanna do any of those big focus attacks you have to hit multiple shrines and increase the bar
[1:38:46] <leith_aziz> This game makes me miss Sleeping Dogs.
[1:38:48] <ToxInjection> It's good to check at every Shrine if you have enough XP for a move. Better than waiting to die to upgrade stuff.
[1:38:51] <leith_aziz> Yoooo
[1:38:54] <+Mendin> going to refil MORE on takedowns
[1:38:55] <DXLelouch24> shrines fully heal you too
[1:38:57] <slix3431> Women do and take less damage but live longer mechanic
[1:38:57] <+mechslayer71> it already did, you just increased it
[1:38:58] <%Th3rd3> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[1:39:00] <CelestialCage> YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL
[1:39:11] <HotSauceFiend> you can be super backseaty but if the driver doesnt pay attention its all good
[1:39:16] <leith_aziz> EY EY EY BIG SMOKE
[1:39:18] <tenshi_q> @HotSauceFiend This LUL
[1:39:18] <+ZENKENmaster> 0 prisoners
[1:39:19] <SheepGetGud> you heal on takedowns by default but it makes it a bit higher, you only really notice it on multiple takedowns but it piles up
[1:39:22] <leith_aziz> IT'S ME CARL. CHILL CHILL
[1:39:23] <+Commander_Warthog> Bent that pipe on his face

[1:46:44] <kenny_biff> Now you're older than chat!
[1:46:44] <user_naim> but i think first succesful run of this level will be 28 years old
[1:46:45] <ElusiveBaikenPlayer> R2 is more like a fighting game dash than a dodge
[1:46:46] <Boegame> hes gonna die of old age before reaching the first boss xD
[1:46:49] <+CookieCutter007> Ben Askren the boxer
[1:46:49] <+Solid_Stro> You ain‚Äôt Vergil sabert14Tsk
[1:46:52] <AnnoyedApricot> the spot dodges are so cool
[1:46:52] <jorniev> maybe use dodge to reposition to a better place mid combo?
[1:46:54] <ToxInjection> These guys suck at first when you're figuring the game out
[1:46:58] <%dds333a> @cookiecutter007 LUL LUL
[1:47:00] <casualshinji> Hair's getting longer.
[1:47:03] <fengxii> ohohoh
[1:47:04] <%legacy0117> Sheesh this game takes 2 or 3 years at a time? Brutal.
[1:47:12] <penitentpendant> Shortcut Unlocked

[1:47:15] <%dds333a> nice updo
[1:47:15] <CelestialCage> I kinda clowned  on thse guys the first time because i had a pipe. Then the next rooms and boss fucked me up
[1:47:20] <+mechslayer71> @legacy0117 it's goes higher. to like 8
[1:47:20] <+johnnychopsocky> Dodging is good to get you away from groups
[1:47:24] <user_naim> @legacy0117 death counter is amount of years lost
[1:47:24] <+AngelYoumou> @legacy0117 It can get up to like, 6 or 7
[1:47:25] <+ScottishMadJacko> stacks
[1:47:26] <demonborntwice> @legacy0117 It takes however many deaths' worth of years you have.
[1:47:28] <+kraajkase> I love that pipe sound
[1:47:34] <SheepGetGud> you can dodge pretty much every combo in the game if you time it right, same with just guarding to do posture damage
[1:47:34] <%DashXero> Starting the Confucian braid...
[1:47:36] <demonborntwice> So like if you keep dying several times in a row, you age much faster.
[1:47:37] <leith_aziz> Black must be the first upgrade you got
[1:47:41] <ToxInjection> @legacy0117 it's based on the death counter. Counter is at 2, you age up by 2. 4, you age by 4 etc
[1:47:42] <%legacy0117> Yoooooo. LUL
[1:47:49] <DXLelouch24> max hp first or your gonna have a bad time
[1:47:54] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz specifically the regen
[1:47:56] <%jepupu> Does Woolie even use focus attacks?
[1:47:57] <edward0286> First time is rough on most, makes you feel badass when you go back and replay levels with more unlocks and items on your board
[1:48:08] <%andrewofbob> @mechslayer71 If the maths is there, it could go up to 10
[1:48:11] <CelestialCage> @jepupu i saw him use eye strike on the fat mini boss
[1:48:16] <ToxInjection> If you let deaths stack up in a row, you'll get fucked real fast
[1:48:19] <BlackermanZX> he has to use focus more often
[1:48:26] <kes009900> gotta taunt more for that 4k score.

[1:52:42] <Nohorse> PHASE 2
[1:52:42] <T_Sasquatch> One thing ive noticed is that alot of people playing this game are super stationary and they hard focus one enemy LUL arkham games have ruined us
[1:52:43] <Madinki> So here I am‚Ä¶..doing everything I can‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
[1:52:44] <+cubbywolf> LEVEL UP

[1:52:55] <CelestialCage> yeeee. He did way better than me
[1:52:57] <RickyRelucent> i though of it and it happpened
[1:52:57] <SheepGetGud> its random
[1:52:58] <TigerClaws12> it's random
[1:52:59] <+Grayhammatter> eyyyy nice
[1:53:01] <Yomamma1337> you were just lucky
[1:53:02] <+JayCWayC> Secrect Badass
[1:53:03] <cosettetape96> you beat em up and then they go strong and get a new moveset
[1:53:10] <+Javaa01> It's a random guy in the group
[1:53:10] <SheepGetGud> certain rooms have one in them but its random who
[1:53:11] <letshavecakes> The lab dummy trained woolie wrong on purpose, as a joke
[1:53:12] <T_Sasquatch> Nah. If you overude takedowns a random enemy gets it
[1:53:16] <edward0286> Randoms can become empowered
[1:53:17] <ToxInjection> NIIIICE
[1:53:20] <blackbaron98> W
[1:53:24] <Pookiedaexzile> So How Old is Woolie gonna be after Mad Dog
[1:53:25] <CelestialCage> Apparently the dev's just thought that "realistically sometime the random guy just turns out to be a complete badass"
[1:53:26] <RickyRelucent> baddie  on baddie violence
[1:53:27] <%Deft_Thought> Dudes who resists the finisher have a tell though
[1:53:28] <Nohorse> Getting piped by a group Kappa
[1:53:30] <pepinillomaton> it's random, you can tell who it is by the  "grey smoke" they emanate
[1:53:36] <+johnnychopsocky> laying pipe is a strong tactic
[1:53:38] <thebalticguy1> THROW
[1:53:40] <Meme_La_Meme> @t_sasquatch I found focusing one guy works better since they die faster, just disrupt the group
[1:53:47] <+puffinup> the devs' idea was basically you don't know who is a badass on sight most of the time
[1:53:50] <%dds333a> he got his gloves, how cordial
[1:53:51] <+puffinup> until you fuck around

[1:54:12] <SheepGetGud> learning parry timing will save your soul
[1:54:12] <ToxInjection> @deft_thought they actually do kinda have tells. The toughie enemy's health bars kinda glow even before trying a takedown on them
[1:54:16] <jimgimp> SONO-BAKANA

[1:54:23] <WanderingYoren> Woolie
[1:54:28] <iacus_> leaves
[1:54:30] <letshavecakes> The idea is that this is like kung fu movies, and every fight has that one goon that puts up a good fight to enable longer setpieces

[1:54:55] <%Deft_Thought> @ToxInjection Yup, and they have a wispy gray aura that you can faintly see if you look closely at them. It's basically the pre-powered up state

[1:55:13] <RabbitsFoot101> I'm pretty sure if you catch them by surprise or get a hit in first, it gives you extra posture damage @WoolieVersus

[1:55:55] <CelestialCage> Spooky
[1:55:55] <leith_aziz> Imagine modern day God Hand
[1:55:57] <%dds333a> @sverisageadvice what do you mean, you can throw shit and it's about revenge Kappa
[1:55:58] <Djazo7> the club

[1:56:05] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I got wooped at the club already
[1:56:09] <ToxInjection> you'll always have a chance to replay the level later to do it better anyway
[1:56:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Gonna be 40+ at the club LUL
[1:56:18] <yukichocomilk> it's a TLOU-like. just like project L is a tekken-like
[1:56:18] <T_Sasquatch> Ironically this game agrees with tlou on revenge LUL
[1:56:23] <+johnnychopsocky> Dudes do not wait their turn in Sifu.  They are rude as hell
[1:56:28] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I got to like 78 and then died

[1:56:39] <leith_aziz> @Reverend_Roscoe pickyO7
[1:56:39] <CelestialCage> Yeah it's like if they took certain modern gameplay mechanics and mixed it with God Hand ones. Even mashing the high dodge reminds me of God Hand dodging
[1:56:44] <+ScottishMadJacko> @t_sasquatch bro did you really just spoil the end
[1:56:44] <Xelhesia> shits locked
[1:56:44] <SheepGetGud> theres two endings, the first you get is revenge, the other i wont spoil

[2:02:54] <gunstars20> it's reactable Kappa
[2:02:55] <+Kavtech> @Awesome_Leaf Over 70

[2:03:59] <a_bald_bro> yes
[2:03:59] <letshavecakes> Woolie took a walk for one afternoon and came back in a midlife crisis

[2:04:02] <+toastybites> the magic is flawed
[2:04:04] <+AWKWARDL0SER> HELLO Grandma!
[2:04:04] <+Bitscreed> "I waited at least 8 years for this"
[2:04:05] <CelestialCage> The magic talisman brings you back to life by aging you

[2:04:07] <+Javaa01> No, it's monkey's paw immortality
[2:04:07] <SheepGetGud> im tellin ya man heavy then sweep combo
[2:04:08] <%dds333a> @a_bald_bro the game says it, Woolz is not THAT blind LUL
[2:04:09] <KyberNasse> It only counts when the runback succeeds
[2:04:10] <gunstars20> Actual magic
[2:04:10] <DSD24> Look how cool you look
[2:04:11] <wqorst> i don't think he's gonna make it all the way guys
[2:04:12] <+Felhad> Always has been
[2:04:13] <onirusha> You're magic woolie
[2:04:13] <mrtanaka111> age is magic
[2:04:14] <Wahrow> It's a kind of magic!
[2:04:14] <cosettetape96> yeah you're aging in real-time as you get back up from death
[2:04:14] <DSD24> I love the jacket
[2:04:15] <%legacy0117> And only way to end an immortal is taking the head off.
[2:04:16] <casualshinji> ...and gives you new clothes.
[2:04:16] <KyberNasse> Kappa
[2:04:17] <leith_aziz> Grandma Run pickyFocus
[2:04:18] <ToxInjection> Now... not to backseat... but you might wanna give that level a few more runs before going to the club LUL
[2:04:21] <%emptyantics> We're all magic
[2:04:22] <+aishman> Go to the tree
[2:04:25] <%hax_metatron> LUL chat thinking 50+ = Grandma are in for a rude shock about how fast you age.
[2:04:26] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> not the most useful of magics but oh well
[2:04:27] <linSP> the power of GETTING OLD
[2:04:28] <niddron> combo menopause
[2:04:28] <CelestialCage> And get new clothes
[2:04:28] <pepinillomaton> it is the realest
[2:04:28] <ToxInjection> 51 is gonna hurt going into the club
[2:04:29] <+Commander_Warthog> Uses up lifetime to resurect
[2:04:29] <+PrefectusCorgi> Go to Tree
[2:04:31] <+johnnychopsocky> How effed would that be if it was real time?  Every year, you come back to beat dudes up
[2:04:33] <exnuart> time for the runback
[2:04:33] <brunoberserk> the game is BRUTAL
[2:04:34] <Xelhesia> now for the club
[2:04:34] <CelestialCage> I like the braid
[2:04:37] <thebalticguy1> You gotta replay that level
[2:04:38] <user_naim> Nah get in the club, fuck age just a number
[2:04:38] <Nohorse> @WoolieVersus Oh no you haven't watered your plants for 30 years
[2:04:40] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie is about to find out soon
[2:04:41] <mrtanaka111> imagine if this game went to 100 age maximun
[2:04:41] <Yomamma1337> now do it again lol
[2:04:42] <NeonBleu> Sacrifice your age for time on the clock
[2:04:42] <velgaduere> @ToxInjection nah let him die and find out
[2:04:42] <SheepGetGud> you can try again and unlock that locked door for a shortcut
[2:04:43] <%nichos7> She looks good for 56
[2:04:47] <+ReefTheWizard> oh dude did you get the menopause buff?
[2:04:48] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Woolie just don‚Äôt didn‚Äôt die 3x you can do this!
[2:04:49] <%hax_metatron> Can't wait for chat to blink and realize they will age 20 years in real life
[2:04:49] <%DashXero> She still looks good for 50-something.
[2:04:50] <niffinbox> spend your boss xp
[2:04:50] <TigerClaws12> RUN IT BACK
[2:04:51] <+JayCWayC> REDO
[2:04:52] <leith_aziz> Fate was much kinder on Fem Sifu compared to male Sifu
[2:04:53] <veryepicwizard> anyone with a 50 year old grandma has a young grandma
[2:04:53] <gunstars20> LUL
[2:04:53] <puse9> literal skill tree
[2:04:54] <RabbitsFoot101> @WoolieVersus So you gotta try and finish the level as young as possible?
[2:04:56] <user_naim> Age is a (big) number
[2:04:56] <mrtanaka111> coward
[2:04:56] <iacus_> yes
[2:04:56] <InspectorWobble> RUN IT BACK
[2:04:57] <ToxInjection> Yeah, Sifu is some SHIT. Oh man.
[2:04:57] <+Javaa01> Hey try to unlock some of those lower skills
[2:05:00] <+Grayhammatter> RUN IT BACK
[2:05:00] <+mechslayer71> you died way more than 5 times
[2:05:04] <+rbakervv> @RabbitsFoot101 that is correct
[2:05:05] <CelestialCage> @nichos7 well so does masahiro sakurai at 51
[2:05:06] <%legacy0117> So, you need to replay to get young. But I gotta see old grandma going in with the fists.
[2:05:08] <Yomamma1337> might wanna reset until you get to 25ish
[2:05:09] <+brightman42> keep going
[2:05:10] <+Mendin> Nah you go through the club to see what the start is
[2:05:13] <+tsundingus> yeah just keep going and see what happens
[2:05:14] <%jepupu> Did Woolie get a permanent unlock at least?
[2:05:15] <%andrewofbob> Or, go and download The Club at 56
[2:05:16] <onirusha> push it to the limit!!
[2:05:17] <TigerClaws12> ye see what else is there
[2:05:17] <spiderously> keep going
[2:05:18] <Yomamma1337> you can keep going if ya want
[2:05:18] <+rafaelba93> or just go, the important thing is YOU learning
[2:05:18] <zhenthrim213> just finished first stage at 29 this game is brutal
[2:05:19] <Nikbottom> Push it
[2:05:19] <thebalticguy1> no downside yet
[2:05:21] <user_naim> just keep going
[2:05:22] <SrHassan> ya died more than 5, remember that strong enemies make it go down by 1
[2:05:23] <niffinbox> died way more than 5
[2:05:25] <gunstars20> gotta see what's next bois
[2:05:27] <ToxInjection> Let's RUN. IT. BACK üëä
[2:05:27] <bentobeatdown> make sure you spend that xp though
[2:05:28] <scrumbotime> worst comes to worst you do some permanent unlocks
[2:05:28] <SheepGetGud> id say goto the next one, get that download, then try again
[2:05:29] <thebalticguy1> 70s
[2:05:31] <+johnnychopsocky> Nah, push forward.  Unlock shit
[2:05:33] <mrtanaka111> 10 years each coin
[2:05:33] <leith_aziz> Around 75
[2:05:36] <+Mendin> 70+ is the final death
[2:05:36] <+puffinup> 75
[2:05:39] <+brightman42> you might be able to unlock something permanently if you keep on
[2:05:39] <ToxInjection> or that. That's cool too.
[2:05:39] <LunarRemix> 75 is dead
[2:05:40] <puse9> 75
[2:05:40] <mrtanaka111> 70
[2:05:41] <CelestialCage> At least check the new level
[2:05:42] <DeliveryPig> heads up, you can HOLD L1 and just tap directionals to DODGE. Works well on bosses
[2:05:45] <@Solidus_113> every coin seems to be 10 years
[2:05:46] <+tsundingus> each coin is 10 years
[2:05:47] <%legacy0117> Aw.
[2:05:47] <kulmoth> 70 is  max
[2:05:57] <iacus_> no shun di  here
[2:05:57] <edward0286> 70 anything after is death
[2:05:57] <leith_aziz> Would be cool if it went up to 90
[2:05:58] <tenshi_q> if you die at any point at 70+ its a game over
[2:05:59] <%legacy0117> I was hoping it went to 90.
[2:06:01] <niffinbox> each coin is 10 years
[2:06:01] <leith_aziz> pickyOld
[2:06:01] <mrtanaka111> 70 the limit,you get to 75 by sucjing
[2:06:01] <SheepGetGud> heavy heavy sweeeep
[2:06:05] <CelestialCage> Hold B to mount downed enemies
[2:06:05] <%andrewofbob> If you line it up, you could time your final death at 79
[2:06:08] <%dds333a> Nah, 100, fight forever Kappa
[2:06:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> notice how your clothes change with age too
[2:06:11] <Nikbottom> "Boss! This 90 year old is beating the crap out of us!"
[2:06:14] <%legacy0117> woolieYE
[2:06:15] <letshavecakes> This is the oldest I think I've seen anyone come out of the first level, goddamn
[2:06:20] <+johnnychopsocky> Sweep hits prone dudes
[2:06:21] <T_Sasquatch> A death after 70 is death. Oldest you can be is 78 i think
[2:06:28] <+Aeriqui> gotta hold circle to ground pound
[2:06:30] <mrtanaka111> @letshavecakes 1 hour of lab
[2:06:31] <Boegame> What we learned so far is that old people do more damage :V
[2:06:33] <leith_aziz> Tonfa
[2:06:38] <%dds333a> @letshavecakes expect nothing less LUL
[2:06:41] <casualshinji> Get the Green Destiny.
[2:06:43] <%Th3rd3> Bonk
[2:06:43] <Skulhuntr> does woolie know about the otg?
[2:06:48] <+puffinup> oh right 10 death count is also instant death
[2:06:54] <veryepicwizard> i'm so excited to turn 30 and lose health in exchange for damage
[2:06:54] <%andrewofbob> Get to 24, clear your death counter, then die 10 times to hit 79
[2:06:58] <a_bald_bro> @letshavecakes its woolie, i'm surprised he didn't game over twice
[2:07:01] <SheepGetGud> those are the weapon types, should be the same moveset
[2:07:11] <+Babooboomin> !uptime
[2:07:11] <@Moobot> @Babooboomin WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 26 minutes

[2:07:24] <ToxInjection> Machetes are fun
[2:07:24] <jorniev> can you taunt in this game?
[2:07:26] <CelestialCage> PEPE SILVIA
[2:07:26] <user_naim> we‚Äôre doing a vintage run right now
[2:07:27] <@Moobot> @veryepicwizard 2510 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:07:27] <veryepicwizard> !motivated
[2:07:27] <+johnnychopsocky> Throwing is sometimes the right move
[2:07:30] <leith_aziz> @jorniev Yes
[2:07:30] <+Mendin> Time for granny to hit up the club
[2:07:31] <+puffinup> @TigerClaws12 it's more equally fucked up :p
[2:07:32] <LoneFonte> @jorniev yep
[2:07:33] <%dds333a> @user_naim I always take the piss out of Woolz in jest
[2:07:39] <mrtanaka111> we just killed a gardner,ad were aiming for a filantrphis and an artist
[2:07:42] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 56 year old grandma clubbin
[2:07:42] <mrtanaka111> are we the baddies
[2:07:45] <CelestialCage> Some keys open shortcuts i think
[2:07:46] <SheepGetGud> its a shortcut/different path
[2:07:47] <+johnnychopsocky> Taunt is right on dpad
[2:07:53] <nintega010> we she hit 60 she gone be looking old
[2:07:55] <%dds333a> @user_naim vintage LUL woolieYE
[2:07:58] <Colby_DJ> Key connects to two doors
[2:08:09] <CelestialCage> pepe silvia
[2:08:10] <+rafaelba93> you get keys in later levels
[2:08:10] <ToxInjection> Shortcuts üëç
[2:08:12] <drunken_lemur> Pepe Silvia
[2:08:14] <+Babooboomin> Hell yeah the triple S bois playing sifu
[2:08:15] <brunoberserk> PEPE SILVA
[2:08:17] <puse9> pepe silva
[2:08:17] <user_naim> @dds333a yeah it IS fun to make fun
[2:08:20] <+tsundingus> CAAAAROOOOOOLL
[2:08:23] <+Javaa01> Yeah you missed two things in that stage, but one you need a key for which you don't have yet
[2:08:26] <zashrin777> I GOT BOXES FULL OF PEPE!
[2:08:26] <Voidvas> I got Boxes full of Pepe
[2:08:30] <WanderingYoren> I got BOXES full of PEPE SIFU!!!
[2:08:31] <edward0286> More keys give shortcuts or missed items, game also encourages time travel in a sense
[2:08:32] <TigerClaws12> sweep disarms too
[2:08:34] <DaBelovedUnderdog> You can go back through now and use the shortcuts
[2:08:37] <Yomamma1337> sweep is broke for most enemies
[2:08:39] <+puffinup> but yeah it's more uhh you don't have the moral high ground, but also they were willing to murder a child so
[2:08:40] <leith_aziz> The Luigi memes introduced me to the Pepe Silvia joke
[2:08:41] <pepinillomaton> after a couple tried im at 23 at the museum and having a blast
[2:08:44] <+Aeriqui> they have to be staggered to sweep
[2:08:46] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:08:49] <+tsundingus> you can cancel into sweep off a lot of things
[2:08:54] <+johnnychopsocky> You can chain sweep into your combo
[2:08:58] <Yomamma1337> pretty sure thats right
[2:08:59] <SheepGetGud> it should be based on who you are hitting
[2:08:59] <Colby_DJ> You can full circle + triangle for sweep
[2:09:01] <bentobeatdown> it's supposed to be that way actually
[2:09:02] <ToxInjection> it takes some getting used to
[2:09:04] <OblivionSword1> enemy can also a void sweep
[2:09:07] <orangerainbow> made it to the end at 21
[2:09:09] <+Babooboomin> yeah thats the right way
[2:09:15] <OblivionSword1> badasses especially
[2:09:17] <letshavecakes> Shortcuts are literally only good for age, you end up losing a lot of shrine upgrades, score, and xp
[2:09:21] <CelestialCage> I like sweeps so my first permanent upgrade was the super sweep
[2:09:23] <LoneFonte> 2 bars tho
[2:09:24] <TigerClaws12> directional is correct woolz, you're doing it right
[2:09:27] <leith_aziz> D:
[2:09:30] <Nohorse> AGE RESTRICTED
[2:09:30] <%dds333a> @oblivionsword1 I know what you're saying, but "void sweep" sounds rad
[2:09:30] <Voidvas> RESET
[2:09:32] <pepinillomaton> too old to learn

[2:15:11] <%OldManJEWc> OldManJEWc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Recently finished Arcane and I had to laugh at the reveal of Ekko because it's blatant that he's a black character. He's got a different intro and everything. I've started to call this Blacktivation. Do you have any favorite moments of Blacktivation?
[2:15:11] <+mechslayer71> come on, let's hit the club
[2:15:13] <+Grayhammatter> it does look good
[2:15:18] <edward0286> Absolver was rough due to pvp I‚Äôd say
[2:15:21] <leith_aziz> @Menitta I would just point him to GG music ngl. They do a lot of simillar stuff with the lyrics and them tying to the themes of the game pickyVibing
[2:15:32] <%elderpunch> @edward0286 true
[2:15:44] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Thats not true
[2:15:46] <DXLelouch24> one guy
[2:15:46] <+toastybites> it saves your best "run"
[2:15:48] <LoneFonte> that is Goblin fuel
[2:15:49] <Colby_DJ> If you beat level 1 at age 20, you are locked into those upgrades
[2:15:51] <+mechslayer71> that doesn't sound right
[2:15:51] <FloatYourGoat> no
[2:15:53] <user_naim> That‚Äôs mad lies
[2:15:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it saves the lowest age
[2:15:56] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz the mark of any soundtrack worth its salt. it's the bare minimum LUL
[2:15:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is this a woolieONEGUY moment?
[2:15:58] <+mechslayer71> oh okay
[2:15:59] <ProjektRF> Like you can't do better than age 20
[2:16:00] <%DaRoosta89> @edward0286 PVE Absolver was pretty cool
[2:16:01] <exnuart> best run is age based
[2:16:02] <Estuko> That sounds super confusing
[2:16:06] <edward0286> You can change your age
[2:16:07] <DaBelovedUnderdog> Yes
[2:16:12] <Colby_DJ> It saves your first perfect run
[2:16:16] <%RyTYoung> You‚Äôre better to get old then start again with perma upgrades
[2:16:16] <pepinillomaton> saves the youngest one
[2:16:30] <%pi_in_the_sci> Remember, shortcuts are double-edged swords, lower age, but fewer upgrades
[2:16:38] <TheSaltminer> your save only updates if you manage to clear at a lower age. If you finish Squats at 20, your age can't lower from there
[2:16:38] <%Kaito_Cam> Kaito_Cam subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Crap did I miss everything for sifu?
[2:16:45] <edward0286> Yes if you do a perfect or better run age wise, that run is saved
[2:16:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:16:48] <niffinbox> best run is saved
[2:16:49] <leith_aziz> Got to Bloody Palace last stage with Dante then died right at the end against Vergil
[2:16:50] <+shivhappy22> it resets all shrines
[2:16:55] <Estuko> @Kaito_Cam just the first level run then restroom right right after
[2:16:56] <exnuart> you missed the squats
[2:16:57] <+DrFacilier> would love a Daredevil game like Sifu
[2:16:59] <leith_aziz> Anyway, Kudos to the player that finished it
[2:17:01] <+Krasmeyts> No way, Pardner @Kaito_Cam woolieFROG
[2:17:03] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Saves the Youngest run and whatever skills you bought in that run, not the shrine rewards
[2:17:12] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:17:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Did he already die?
[2:17:23] <Pookiedaexzile> I went to the bathroom for 2 seconds
[2:17:26] <+capybruhArt> blacktivation lmao
[2:17:29] <TigerClaws12> if you use shortcuts for your young/perfect runs, you get less shrines sometimes and the game saves it for next stage so be wary @WoolieVersus
[2:17:33] <Neptious> POWERRANGERS BLACKTIVATE
[2:17:34] <spokensun> lol
[2:17:34] <zashrin777> The exaggerated swagger

[2:17:41] <+TheFrancix> Blacktivation lmaooo
[2:17:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I feel its kinda racist to give Black characters hip hop background music like that
[2:17:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH ROFLLL
[2:17:50] <+JayCWayC> It was cool, but it really was this is the black
[2:17:54] <Darkdrill> LUL so true

[2:17:58] <leith_aziz> @dds333a I dont know, sir. What those games do are HIGH standards to me. That's why I respect em
[2:18:00] <Voidvas> Marc Ekko
[2:18:11] <+Grayhammatter> the exaggerated blacktivation
[2:18:28] <pepinillomaton> He popped his black trigger
[2:18:29] <cosettetape96> whoa, we talkin about racism? wha happen
[2:18:31] <leith_aziz> Im not well educated enough on this topic to add anything to the conversation
[2:18:38] <+mechslayer71> it's not racist if it's not a negative connotation
[2:18:44] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz even bottom of the barrel Hollywood movies have their soundtracks match to the theme of the film or scene LUL
[2:18:45] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> i've noticed that many black women in videogames have an afro
[2:18:46] <+JayCWayC> Its how its handled / executed that matters.
[2:18:47] <zashrin777> Feels more like a culture thing than racism
[2:18:50] <FrostedZaibatsu> Long as he's not chucking and jiving
[2:18:51] <leith_aziz> When Miles listens to Sunflower in Into the Spiderverse, I dig that character moment
[2:18:58] <%dds333a> @mechslayer71 it can be stereotypical
[2:19:11] <cosettetape96> it's a stock archetype not a racist stereotype
[2:19:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I guess it just because I've never listened to hip hop despite being black
[2:19:13] <%emptyantics> Moonlight is a film about black people but it uses classical music to represent their emotions and capture moments in time
[2:19:14] <Voidvas> They made a Modern Day AMV moment
[2:19:18] <+Mendin> Sifu was briefly paused for Sipu
[2:19:21] <+mechslayer71> @dds333a yeah, but those aren't necessarily the same thing all the way
[2:19:22] <+TossuDa> would certainly nice to see something else once in a while

[2:22:43] <+aram909> its a little tiny bit metroidvania
[2:22:45] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz and I'm saying a basic requirement for a soundtrack is to have it match the theme and tone for the scene or character it pertains to. most soundtracks do this LUL
[2:22:46] <SheepGetGud> yup, whole new place that connects later
[2:22:46] <ImPrettyBadAtTheGame> fuck yo hat
[2:22:47] <ToxInjection> fuck that, I'll be the elderly dude at a Skrillex show. I don't give a fuck

[2:22:54] <+Krasmeyts> What's wrong with the club at 55? woolieFROG
[2:22:56] <%DashXero> That's what he gets for wearing that stupid hat!
[2:23:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Dodge
[2:23:06] <mrtanaka111> holy shit
[2:23:13] <%RyTYoung> I struggle to know if I‚Äôve successfully parried or not in this too
[2:23:30] <ToxInjection> thanks for hitting your homie LUL
[2:23:33] <%crybirb> Life and posture always
[2:23:41] <%DaRoosta89> have they found the joy of throwing shit at people?
[2:23:42] <demonborntwice> Weapon durability works.
[2:23:45] <%legacy0117> Heyyy you got a bat this time. ^^
[2:23:48] <iacus_> why would the durability of weapons be tied to your age lol
[2:23:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:23:52] <$SilverRoddo> Pat‚Äôs murder bat
[2:23:56] <+RahkshiLord> weapon durability is very good
[2:23:59] <%DashXero> Was that guy takin' a piss?
[2:24:02] <+RahkshiLord> clear entire rooms
[2:24:04] <%dds333a> @iacus_ LUL LUL
[2:24:06] <pepinillomaton> big shortcut
[2:24:06] <SheepGetGud> the orange attacks do alot of poise damage but are blockable, dodgable, and parryable
[2:24:09] <%crybirb> @iacus_ old poeple don't play baseball
[2:24:09] <$SilverRoddo> Under gripping a bat?
[2:24:11] <ToxInjection> @daroosta89 hs hasn't really done it much yet
[2:24:21] <jorniev> baseball guy from the raid 2
[2:24:22] <%Kaito_Cam> @iacus_ when you get older as a martial artist maybe you lose control of your strength and start smashing bats
[2:24:22] <357Sneak> KSHRRRE
[2:24:24] <+leviting> get those junpei pings
[2:24:25] <%Charronia> Boss run
[2:24:25] <+mechslayer71> way less experience tho
[2:24:30] <ToxInjection> abusing bottles when you can really comes in clutch though
[2:24:33] <DXLelouch24> but you miss a shrine
[2:24:34] <TigerClaws12> art of war LUL
[2:24:34] <Yomamma1337> shorcuts mean less statues, so it hurts you in the long run
[2:24:36] <cosettetape96> still mad that they removed the SCHKREEEEE from Brawl and Ult
[2:24:36] <+ValHollaYoloson> You also skip an upgrade statue
[2:24:37] <DXLelouch24> risk reward
[2:24:39] <pepinillomaton> you clear fast but you miss 1 shrine with this route
[2:24:42] <%andrewofbob> Helps to bank a lower age for the next level
[2:24:42] <RabbitsFoot101> Find shortcuts, to shorten the run yeah
[2:24:56] <+rafaelba93> also less enemies for XP and score
[2:24:59] <+RahkshiLord> shortcut only gives you 2 shines so you get less upgrades, and you won't get enough points to unlock the parry buff
[2:24:59] <DXLelouch24> other shortcuts so far for me seem less trappish
[2:25:01] <%dds333a> @cosettetape96 I missed it too :(
[2:25:03] <+RahkshiLord> not worth it
[2:25:06] <demonborntwice> Oof.
[2:25:08] <iacus_> almost
[2:25:11] <+theoldone001> Sweep to disarm
[2:25:12] <+Grayhammatter> damn
[2:25:13] <%crybirb> I guess shes not armed anymore
[2:25:15] <edward0286> Museum has the quickest shortcut I think
[2:25:19] <+Bitscreed> Not even the ancient Joestar family technique could help you there.
[2:25:20] <ToxInjection> I love how much this game emphasizes situational awareness and using your environment. So easy to get surrounded...
[2:25:22] <mrtanaka111> HES ALREADY 21?
[2:25:23] <BaslerJones> can you do the jackie chan thing where you put a trash can over a guy's head
[2:25:23] <Awesome_Leaf> mfw shes armed üò†
[2:25:29] <$SilverRoddo> I like the Captain Marvel hip sash.
[2:25:33] <%crybirb> Museum is just the entry and then elevator directly to boss right?
[2:25:45] <%SomeAsianDood> yeah museum short cut was very useful. mainly cuz I sucked at the boss
[2:25:52] <DXLelouch24> level 3 shortcuts are fantastic cause you at most only have to fight 3-4 encounters then boss with shortcuts used wisely
[2:25:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Running and funneling opponents is the way
[2:25:58] <%crybirb> Museum boss was the ahrdest for me, first phase is a b
[2:26:07] <%DreamCancel01> That lady became a superhero
[2:26:20] <$SilverRoddo> C-c-c-c-combo burekaa
[2:26:24] <AnnoyedApricot> YO
[2:26:25] <%DaRoosta89> that elevator is kinda cheap tho
[2:26:26] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[2:26:27] <Awesome_Leaf> paper towel roll sound LUL
[2:26:28] <DXLelouch24> AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[2:26:28] <+Jiggisnipe> OH SHIT
[2:26:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> some sound designer had a lot of fun hitting things with a bamboo stick, god bless

[2:26:31] <+puffinup> YEEEEEEEE
[2:26:31] <+Grayhammatter> YOOOOO
[2:26:33] <%crybirb> I was hit with a dry bamboo once and it didn't hit, just made funny noise
[2:26:33] <DXLelouch24> YOU THOUGH

[2:26:40] <Deko_> SHIT
[2:26:40] <cosettetape96> Bosses that can pull the SAME SHIT you can!
[2:26:42] <cosettetape96> THE BEST!
[2:26:42] <+Grayhammatter> she's REAL
[2:26:43] <+Catpurnicus> "Thanks"
[2:26:44] <%andrewofbob> I'm dangerous, take this
[2:26:46] <DXLelouch24> you thought you were the only one
[2:26:46] <BaslerJones> what is the yellow bar under the health
[2:26:48] <user_naim> you fucking thought
[2:26:49] <+zyberion626> the real protag
[2:26:50] <iacus_> that was so good
[2:26:51] <+Javaa01> They will catch ALL weapons
[2:26:52] <velgaduere> BANG BANG BANG
[2:26:56] <ToxInjection> I LOVE that animation for crossing the table the long way. So fucking cool.
[2:26:57] <velgaduere> PULL MY KUNG FU TRIGGER
[2:26:59] <Onamar> sweeps and pushes disarm
[2:26:59] <+Babooboomin> that fighting spirit
[2:27:00] <pepinillomaton> Im hulking up!
[2:27:04] <iacus_> kinda crap that they caths all but eh
[2:27:05] <%Namillus> That's gotta be a Strong Enemy property
[2:27:06] <+Catpurnicus> that dudes hand is through his crotch
[2:27:08] <cosettetape96> @BaslerJones a Sekiro stagger bar
[2:27:09] <+AngelYoumou> @BaslerJones Poise
[2:27:15] <Nikbottom> the guy in a kungfu movie that will NOT be fucked with
[2:27:16] <DXLelouch24> no its bad
[2:27:17] <BaslerJones> coool
[2:27:19] <DXLelouch24> you miss a shrine
[2:27:20] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus shortcuts miss shrines meaning you dont want to use them
[2:27:22] <$SilverRoddo> This is pretty rad
[2:27:23] <TheSaltminer> someone call Maximilian, these dudes have Boss Rage
[2:27:23] <Parapattern> Magenta Cocaine
[2:27:23] <%andrewofbob> But only 2 shrines
[2:27:25] <+aram909> yoiu get way less xp
[2:27:28] <+aram909> and less shrines
[2:27:28] <+mechslayer71> but you get less experience and abilities
[2:27:29] <hasansviewcountbot> this game looks so good to bad it's on Epic Game store
[2:27:30] <DXLelouch24> @Yomamma1337 not all shortcuts
[2:27:31] <%dds333a> That Skooma
[2:27:33] <TigerClaws12> you lose 1 shrine with this route
[2:27:36] <+aram909> you also cant go back and do the oldboy scene
[2:27:38] <jorniev> RESPECT
[2:27:39] <ToxInjection> Just snort grounded up flower petals
[2:27:40] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus this levels shortcut is a trap
[2:27:52] <Yomamma1337> shrines also carry over into new levels, so you want them
[2:27:56] <demonborntwice> My guess is the last collectible is behind that private door.
[2:27:57] <+theoldone001> This and Absolver's artstyle is so cool.
[2:28:06] <+Mendin> This level's shortcut is for labbing the first boss
[2:28:18] <%Kaito_Cam> I found out you can skip the big man by just bum rushing him and you get an insta kil
[2:28:19] <tolloponik> Potimkin!!!
[2:28:24] <RabbitsFoot101> @WoolieVersus Rush the big guy first to get quick takedown
[2:28:24] <ToxInjection> yeah, it's mainly just so you enter the next level at as young an age as you can manage.
[2:28:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The Spinebuster is dope though
[2:28:28] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you can one shot fat guy if you attack him mid convo, game never tells you this
[2:28:36] <+itspequod1> worship the cult of pipe
[2:28:40] <+Shotgundam009> This kinda makes me wanna play For honor
[2:28:42] <niffinbox> other collectible is locked until later
[2:28:43] <+Grayhammatter> wow, really fucked them up
[2:28:43] <+mechslayer71> through the pipe mid convo, run in for flying knee
[2:28:44] <jv5_guy> woolie lost weight gj
[2:28:44] <cosettetape96> @DXLelouch24 EJEJEJE SPOILERS
[2:28:55] <DXLelouch24> not really spoilers if you are never told
[2:28:58] <Awesome_Leaf> MORE DURIBILITY
[2:28:58] <+mechslayer71> throw*
[2:28:59] <%andrewofbob> @DXLelouch24 Trouble is, the convo picked was pretty short
[2:29:06] <cosettetape96> you're supposed to figure it out yourself!~
[2:29:11] <Pookiedaexzile> YOu have untill 60 to ge that tho
[2:29:22] <%SomeAsianDood> if I had a nickle for each game with purple cocaine I've played, I'd have 2 nickles. not much but it's weird that it's happened twice.
[2:29:25] <+AngelYoumou> IIRC, Taunt gives you a score multiplier?
[2:29:29] <DXLelouch24> yes
[2:29:30] <+Javaa01> @cosettetape96 He already figured out that surprise hits instantly break posture
[2:29:31] <ToxInjection> Better structure is never a bad idea
[2:29:33] <DXLelouch24> up to x5
[2:29:39] <demonborntwice> So basically, you wanna get through and do everything, and then later do a shortcut run to just bring the age down?
[2:29:46] <DXLelouch24> no
[2:29:53] <+rafaelba93> behind the door
[2:29:55] <DXLelouch24> you want to get all shrines and be as young as possible
[2:29:55] <+aram909> you get the key much later, no spoilers
[2:30:01] <DXLelouch24> THAT is the ideal run
[2:30:02] <demonborntwice> Ah, so just Git Gud.
[2:30:03] <SheepGetGud> reminder that L1 parries and doges give you attack priority so its your turn, but R2 doesnt since your far away
[2:30:03] <ImPrettyBadAtTheGame> young lady
[2:30:05] <+Mendin> Your agedown run also carries the shrine unlocks so you want to do a full clear good run
[2:30:06] <edward0286> You can‚Äôt unlock that door till you get an item from the last level
[2:30:07] <demonborntwice> Makes sense.
[2:30:08] <%DashXero> Eh, they'll figure it out.
[2:30:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah and you can animation cancel the taunt with dodge after you get the multiplier
[2:30:11] <DaBelovedUnderdog> No some collectibles are in other levels
[2:30:12] <mrtanaka111> mago
[2:30:14] <+rafaelba93> you can skip
[2:30:16] <+Javaa01> You can skip these btw
[2:30:17] <$SilverRoddo> Boss arena
[2:30:18] <jorniev> actual super powers
[2:30:19] <BaslerJones> keanu reeves ?
[2:30:21] <mrtanaka111> mago del verde
[2:30:22] <Parapattern> Coming in HOT
[2:30:23] <LunarRemix> That was like a 20 minutes shortcut
[2:30:27] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus hold X you can skip these cutscenes
[2:30:40] <%Kaito_Cam> Anyone else think this dudes grunt sound dumb.
[2:30:42] <ToxInjection> Let's try not aging to 54 now üëç

[2:31:10] <zhenthrim213> TRACKED
[2:31:11] <+mechslayer71> @leith_aziz he shortcuts through like 79 percent of the level
[2:31:11] <Onamar> gotta sidestep overheads
[2:31:12] <ToxInjection> good so far
[2:31:14] <+El_Rabbit> That's cheap
[2:31:14] <+Grayhammatter> homing KICK

[2:31:18] <SheepGetGud> you can spotdodge the jump attacks
[2:31:19] <velgaduere> if this boss says "nya~" ONE more time...
[2:31:22] <+theoldone001> That's some Dark Souls 2 tracking lol
[2:31:29] <$SilverRoddo> Prototype divekicks?!
[2:31:29] <jorniev> dodging forward seemed too work super well when he does the jump kick
[2:31:30] <triangularblasphemy> Her ankles!
[2:31:33] <+Grayhammatter> OWCH
[2:31:33] <ImPrettyBadAtTheGame> broken ankles
[2:31:37] <+puffinup> he's weak to spot dodgeeeessss
[2:31:37] <ToxInjection> that fucking kick TRACKED
[2:31:38] <%DaRoosta89> wtf i didnt know he could slide under the plants
[2:31:39] <+Jiggisnipe> Like VF Kappa
[2:31:40] <DXLelouch24> use your focus, smoke em if you gottem as Liam says
[2:31:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Dodge
[2:31:46] <velgaduere> sure is
[2:31:49] <%Charronia> Gotta spend those bars
[2:31:50] <triangularblasphemy> This homeless gardener has a ROCKET PACK
[2:31:52] <SheepGetGud> you dont have two bars
[2:31:54] <+puffinup> you don't even have two bars unlocked
[2:31:56] <%Kaito_Cam> Plus you don't have 2 bars of focus
[2:32:01] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You don't even have 2 bars yet, you only have 1 bar
[2:32:01] <velgaduere> strong sweep is pretty good
[2:32:04] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you have ONE bar of focus, you have to get more via shrines
[2:32:05] <SheepGetGud> lol
[2:32:06] <%SomeAsianDood> environmental mastery is good
[2:32:07] <$SilverRoddo> Hit em high hit em high hit em high hit em high üé∂
[2:32:16] <SheepGetGud> i dont like focus sweep
[2:32:18] <tenshi_q> the sweep is pretty much the only focus attack worth getting
[2:32:26] <SheepGetGud> if you eye poke you can manually sweep after for free
[2:32:29] <SheepGetGud> more damage
[2:32:31] <DXLelouch24> otgs are godlike in Sifu
[2:32:35] <+Grayhammatter> not bad, age 22
[2:32:41] <DXLelouch24> get em in a pattern
[2:32:41] <tenshi_q> @SheepGetGud true but sometimes the sweep just murders a dude for free
[2:32:42] <Zooperton> 22 üßì
[2:32:43] <+TheMilkiestShake> @DXLelouch24 otgs?
[2:32:49] <DXLelouch24> on the groundf
[2:32:53] <DXLelouch24> on the ground*
[2:33:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You can continue to sweep grounded opponents to soccer kick them otg
[2:33:08] <SheepGetGud> not bosses lol
[2:33:09] <jorniev> are focus attacks like the roulette wheel from god hand?

[2:34:25] <+aram909> man i really wish you could disarm him and take his knife
[2:34:28] <demonborntwice> Bamboo-assisted jump is so rad.
[2:34:30] <Aussie_Manny> Ahh, I see Woolie chose the female Sifu.
[2:34:34] <Aussie_Manny> markel6Fighton
[2:34:37] <jorniev> he grows bamboo to do super jumps what a mad lad
[2:34:41] <leith_aziz> Hello Aussie
[2:34:46] <leith_aziz> pickyWave

[2:34:48] <Awesome_Leaf> this stage lowkey looks easier
[2:34:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He's become the archnemesis of HoboCop: HoboCriminal
[2:34:55] <Yomamma1337> you can spot dodge basically all his shit
[2:34:57] <tenshi_q> R2 dodge really messin woolie up
[2:35:06] <%legacy0117> woolieSHOOKREG You got Woolie!

[2:35:12] <FrozenPockets> let the man work
[2:35:14] <%legacy0117> This*
[2:35:16] <+puffinup> R2 dodge is really only for like group fights
[2:35:20] <+aram909> the audio cue for the focus meter is so fucking good
[2:35:21] <+puffinup> to get out of the middle of bois
[2:35:36] <+Grayhammatter> yoooo it's going better
[2:35:41] <mrtanaka111> youre almost too old to go to the club
[2:35:43] <Yomamma1337> you can spot dodge that too
[2:35:44] <+aram909> biting and instant and you hear it above everything else, and short enough to be a little reminder of your focus bar, such good sound design
[2:35:44] <gothmanmothman> ok Woolie's improving really well tho
[2:35:45] <velgaduere> @legacy0117 aw, I thought I finally caught him... doodSad
[2:35:50] <+RahkshiLord> mash that L1 dodge like you're god hand

[2:36:06] <SheepGetGud> theres no side dodge with L1 it just looks like it
[2:36:07] <FrozenPockets> savage
[2:36:07] <Pookiedaexzile> 26 is a good Age
[2:36:08] <Yomamma1337> you can spot dodge it
[2:36:08] <velgaduere> this stage ain't too hard to deathless, though
[2:36:08] <tenshi_q> 26 pretty alright
[2:36:09] <iacus_> gotem
[2:36:11] <SheepGetGud> its just up and down
[2:36:14] <niffinbox> 26 is good
[2:36:16] <AngryAsian5> Well done
[2:36:17] <Jontman42> 8 long years and only 6 short ones this time
[2:36:17] <+Tajy_Venom> that L1 dodge slow down is really helpful
[2:36:22] <+mechslayer71> I finished the whole level at 23 suprCHAD
[2:36:23] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus theres weapons in the 2nd phase arena fyi, something to use in perfecting your runs
[2:36:28] <user_naim> no longer old
[2:36:30] <Yomamma1337> weapons can be parried and spot dodged
[2:36:32] <%legacy0117> Got eeeeemmm. woolieGASM
[2:36:33] <+puffinup> L1 dodge is the most important thing
[2:36:36] <UnrealStyrofoam> You have the option to spare bosses in this game
[2:36:40] <niffinbox> that slash attack just run away
[2:36:44] <+Grayhammatter> no longer old SeemsGood
[2:36:46] <SheepGetGud> spoilers
[2:36:47] <+puffinup> @UnrealStyrofoam not until ng+

[2:37:04] <%legacy0117> Kinda late to mention that?‚Äô!
[2:37:08] <DXLelouch24> locked door is an ENDGAME door
[2:37:11] <FrozenPockets> Club about to get lit

[2:37:17] <+theoldone001> Boomer Sifu looks way cooler though
[2:37:17] <Iza_kku> why don't you just write out the entire plot word for word while you're at it chat
[2:37:19] <+Javaa01> @UnrealStyrofoam Nah you can do it from the start, but the game only tells you about it once you hit NG+
[2:37:35] <Pookiedaexzile> You see in the first level you acutally play as the Last Boss
[2:37:45] <DXLelouch24> dummy wont help you at all imo, too limited
[2:37:46] <iacus_> let's goo
[2:37:50] <UnrealStyrofoam> @javaa01 Just giving the headsup because I don't think they're gonna run the game again
[2:37:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:37:51] <+Grayhammatter> da club!
[2:37:52] <a_bald_bro> That's a very solid age

[2:37:54] <+Grayhammatter> lets go!
[2:37:57] <Nikbottom> allowed to club
[2:37:57] <fairore> why did woolie  choose the female avatar?
[2:37:57] <DaBelovedUnderdog> The club is going to be rough. Woolie needs to get dodging down
[2:37:57] <+Zalapski> if the game doesn't tell you about it yet, maybe don't spoil it for everyone...?
[2:37:58] <GHouseduivel> But how do you know the moves are good unless you try them out
[2:37:59] <DXLelouch24> real training is experience

[2:55:13] <+Babooboomin> the Sweeps are tough
[2:55:15] <SheepGetGud> parrying the third hit opens him up but its hard to time
[2:55:20] <Wofoeh> Imagine chat, you stance up and your opponent fucking River dances
[2:55:23] <+Mendin> @cosettetape96 His swagger is slghtly exaggerated

[3:06:24] <%crybirb> @iacus_ Literally doesn't make sense what you just said. Besides aging better or worse is more an opinion than a science bro
[3:06:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 58
[3:06:31] <+Grayhammatter> got opened up LUL
[3:06:32] <DSD24> Bodies
[3:06:34] <%andrewofbob> @Boegame To be fair, this game really rewards dirty fighting

[3:07:29] <Judgeanon> Woolie demanding to speak to the Club's manager.
[3:07:34] <iacus_> @crybirb I never claimed to give a scientific definition. Use social context cues to know what people usually mean by "age better"
[3:07:35] <spokensun> @mechslayer71 shut up

[3:11:36] <stevenellis386> i would love to be 69 and this fit
[3:11:36] <Arqartur0> So when's Daredevil showing up!?
[3:11:38] <%andrewofbob> Parry is 3 frames, I feel

[3:11:41] <+mechslayer71> there's a weapon here btw
[3:11:44] <SheepGetGud> the shrine will heal
[3:11:44] <brexdq> nice again
[3:11:44] <T_Sasquatch> Remember woolie, this game has unlocks and requires some grinding to lessen the pain
[3:11:45] <%crybirb> It heals in the boss room
[3:11:45] <+sevorai> wall bounces do a lotta stability damage to these folks
[3:11:46] <+mechslayer71> too late I guess
[3:11:47] <ToxInjection> oh boy, this is gonna be fun
[3:11:51] <mrtanaka111> death is practice
[3:11:57] <TigerClaws12> too old FeelsBadMan
[3:11:58] <velgaduere> n-nice...
[3:12:02] <velgaduere> doodSad
[3:12:02] <%legacy0117> You better back off the boss though, if Druid Hobo was anything to go by. woolieSHOOKREG
[3:12:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @stevenellis386 i would love to be any age and be that fit LUL
[3:12:09] <Wofoeh> @WoolieVersus There should be an realistic aging mode, where if you try to throw a roundhouse at 60+ your character falls to the floor after hearing a  crack and he/she yells "AH MY FUCKEN BACK"
[3:12:12] <rReizs> exercise regularly and this may still be achievable
[3:12:15] <%crybirb> it heals between phases too
[3:12:17] <%legacy0117> Gameovers man.
[3:12:28] <stevenellis386> @cobalt_phoenix_ lol
[3:12:31] <stevenellis386> true
[3:12:34] <tenshi_q> time to learn
[3:12:34] <ToxInjection> Imagine he actually beats him first try though
[3:12:36] <TigerClaws12> the drip
[3:12:42] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[3:12:44] <%crybirb> The strongest dude I've met was 54, so I'm not surprised if I find a 60+ that can pull some punches.
[3:12:45] <%SomeAsianDood> it's fucking SEAN
[3:12:46] <velgaduere> HE SAID THE THING
[3:12:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> roll credits

[3:13:46] <Xeno351> this guy has to have two phases
[3:13:48] <tenshi_q> pretty sure this fight is impossible if you dont learn to evade LUL
[3:13:48] <+Grayhammatter> fucking owch
[3:13:49] <+mechslayer71> yeah this boss isn't as good as the first one TBH
[3:13:51] <+Commander_Warthog> Somebody please take their ganny home
[3:13:52] <SheepGetGud> orange hits are parriable
[3:13:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> @3d_pbandj thats his name I forgot but thought of him instantly
[3:13:54] <Awesome_Leaf> some were flashing
[3:13:57] <+TheFrancix> last chance
[3:13:59] <T_Sasquatch> @damie904 oh ... I never saw it that way tbh
[3:14:00] <penitentpendant> Final Fightu
[3:14:02] <a_bald_bro> easiest boss tbh just gotta learn the moves a bit
[3:14:03] <+Grayhammatter> the last chance
[3:14:04] <SheepGetGud> even if you are red parries prevent guard break
[3:14:04] <ToxInjection> God this music is sick
[3:14:05] <Judgeanon> Last shot baybeeeeeh
[3:14:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lat hit
[3:14:05] <FrozenPockets> you had a good run
[3:14:08] <edward0286> Doge more than parry with him
[3:14:11] <Pookiedaexzile> You can't Parry Everything
[3:14:15] <TigerClaws12> weapon just does heavy posture damage
[3:14:21] <+AWKWARDL0SER> This is the fight I‚Äôve been hearing was roof stoof
[3:14:22] <Wofoeh> Download all you can
[3:14:23] <%DaRoosta89> calling woolie got this phase 1 in 2 runs
[3:14:26] <PunishedFurby> i hope my hair goes totally white like that
[3:14:29] <+3d_pbandj> @3d_pbandj I know right? Bandages and burning hands is right on the nose!
[3:14:31] <Wofoeh> Oooooo that combo was neat
[3:14:36] <SheepGetGud> you can parry pretty much everything he has
[3:14:36] <Boegame> those old BONES deal more damage
[3:14:37] <ToxInjection> Parrying is still not the solution to all parryable attacks
[3:14:38] <+TheBitingIrish> Gramma pepehands
[3:14:39] <a_bald_bro> Max Dood described it as a punchout boss and he's totally right lol
[3:14:40] <SheepGetGud> every staff strike at least
[3:14:41] <%RyTYoung> It‚Äôs not over until a head hits the mat Kappa
[3:14:45] <SheepGetGud> it just doesnt stagger him

[3:20:28] <FrozenPockets> he's doing science
[3:20:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Avoid?
[3:20:34] <%andrewofbob> I think you can press block any time
[3:20:34] <+chiazam> Woolie gets hits in the back of the head all the time instead of parrying
[3:20:35] <%pi_in_the_sci> Sweep for crowd control
[3:20:41] <+mechslayer71> @user_naim usually works best when they're athletic
[3:20:43] <Yomamma1337> you can also just keep parrying until you break their posture
[3:20:46] <%RyTYoung> Either avoid or dodge
[3:21:07] <tenshi_q> just having good avoid and parry game takes you real far
[3:21:11] <Yomamma1337> @RyTYoung avoid or parry, you still get hit if you ddoge
[3:21:25] <%crybirb> Is there any martial arts movie with a strong club vibe like this section? I would be up for that
[3:21:27] <+mechslayer71> go upstairs first
[3:21:28] <+chiazam> You could play this whole game on only parrying and avoiding
[3:21:56] <%RyTYoung> @yomamma1337 I mean dodging to get out of groups, I know it‚Äôs not a reliable way to get out wo talking a hit over parrying and avoiding

[3:25:39] <Judgeanon> Yeah, that other door has one board item but isn't really important... for now.
[3:25:44] <%crybirb> The game needs to unload the level somewhere =P
[3:25:48] <+mechslayer71> FIGHT THEM THIS TIME COWARD
[3:25:51] <+sevorai> i think best bet is to assume any door that requires like a key could be hard prog

[3:30:59] <demonborntwice> No honor.  Only fists.
[3:30:59] <%andrewofbob> Throwing your weapon is a weapon duel... are we Nighogg?
[3:31:05] <FrozenPockets> this is that kowloon style street kung fu

[3:31:36] <a_bald_bro> i cant figure out how to open that box and i beat the level

[3:32:02] <niffinbox> @a_bald_bro look for key in another level
[3:32:04] <Pookiedaexzile> It will save your life
[3:32:05] <user_naim> she does if you leave the weapon altogether
[3:32:06] <a_bald_bro> this duo is hard
[3:32:14] <%SomeAsianDood> @a_bald_bro key is not in that level
[3:32:14] <a_bald_bro> @a_bald_bro ohhh another level ok
[3:32:24] <%jaco_checkbox> aw
[3:32:33] <Yomamma1337> parry or avoid, dodging sucks ass
[3:32:37] <iacus_> 49 huh. just a bit better
[3:32:50] <Onamar> Spot dodge
[3:32:58] <DSD24> Dodging is good but miss timing it can lead to more mistakes
[3:33:02] <+Tajy_Venom> avoid is the key. dodging isn't as good
[3:33:06] <a_bald_bro> it takes pracice man all good
[3:33:08] <+Grayhammatter> gah damn, some meaty punches
[3:33:12] <+chiazam> Woolie hasn't realized that dodging backwards means he can't punish
[3:33:13] <DSD24> The stairs
[3:33:14] <+Xelig> the fight with these two is seriously one of the hardest in the game
[3:33:18] <%baka_sugoi> oof
[3:33:19] <+sevorai> dodging does seem to leave you more open compared to blocking/parry when  youre surrounded
[3:33:23] <penitentpendant> We warned you 'bout those stairs, bro!
[3:33:24] <%Explodincatz> I didnt warn u but still man
[3:33:24] <Boegame> stairs, old peoples greatest enemy
[3:33:24] <+Commander_Warthog> Muh hip"
[3:33:25] <Pookiedaexzile> See how he Avoided you
[3:33:25] <DSD24> I told you about the stairs
[3:33:26] <majindusto> SO BRITTLE
[3:33:34] <%andrewofbob> Early dodging is back, just-dodging gets you an opening
[3:33:34] <mrtanaka111> im disappointed
[3:33:37] <+3d_pbandj> grandma status get
[3:33:39] <%andrewofbob> bad*
[3:33:44] <Yomamma1337> you can hitconfirm into a throw after a parry
[3:33:49] <DancesWitBalrog> Brittle Bones
[3:33:51] <%RyTYoung> It‚Äôs kinda hard to get it midstring
[3:33:53] <Yomamma1337> dont have to throw right away
[3:33:58] <FassieFons> osteoporosis up, health down
[3:34:00] <Xeno351> doesn't woolie not read chat so this is everyone backseating to themselves?
[3:34:03] <SheepGetGud> with the three punch combo the first and third should disrupt it
[3:34:08] <FrozenPockets> @SheepGetGud I hope so
[3:34:10] <Yomamma1337> @Xeno351 he reads chat occasionally
[3:34:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:34:11] <user_naim> @yomamma1337 this is the real shit right here
[3:34:16] <+chiazam> @Xeno351 Pretty much yeah
[3:34:17] <DSD24> We looking good
[3:34:24] <OblivionSword1> @Xeno351 occasionally he reads chat
[3:34:34] <PunkZedB> I like that hey have little dining tables in their fire palace
[3:34:34] <+sevorai> Reggie does occasionally too
[3:34:39] <%RyTYoung> @xeno351 he will glance at chat sometimes
[3:34:43] <%pi_in_the_sci> it's a different skill
[3:34:44] <velgaduere> it is, but you gotta have the skill for it
[3:34:46] <penitentpendant> Stick Acquired
[3:34:47] <Sakom_Muwin> The dev's previous game absolver is very similar to this game, but this seems more refined
[3:34:50] <tenshi_q> if he doesn't see chat telling him he
[3:34:51] <+chiazam> I think the reason he gets hit so often is because he's experimenting a lot
[3:34:53] <+Mendin> Gotta learn that Environment Kick No Jutsu
[3:34:57] <+balkonas1> Is this Woolies first run?
[3:34:59] <velgaduere> check your skill tree for environmental something or other
[3:35:01] <demonborntwice> @PunkZedB I mean, hey, gotta eat.
[3:35:04] <tenshi_q> he'll figure it out on his own*
[3:35:05] <HomebaseRED> oof that's bright after those rooms
[3:35:06] <%KillerFlow> so you can literally be Jackie Chan LUL
[3:35:08] <+sevorai> i think second run?
[3:35:11] <%RyTYoung> @balkonas1 second run at the club
[3:35:19] <%andrewofbob> @balkonas1 2nd club run; had 2 runs on slums
[3:35:20] <DSD24> Staff Stinger
[3:35:24] <+Grayhammatter> yes, 2nd club run
[3:35:26] <+chiazam> @balkonas1 This is like the third or fourth time he's attempted this level
[3:35:26] <%Lion_kun> Hey chat, once you beat a boss, do you have to refight him if you die
[3:35:32] <tenshi_q> yes you do
[3:35:34] <DSD24> Watch Sean do a Torande
[3:35:36] <+balkonas1> Cheers
[3:35:43] <RAH001> Sifu muddafucker who you
[3:35:53] <mrtanaka111> is sweep aways better than eye poke?
[3:35:55] <+chiazam> You only have to refight a boss if you want to finish the level again
[3:35:55] <DSD24> Is that a staff on the wall?
[3:35:58] <%RyTYoung> @lion_kun if you finish the level no, but if you finished the level at an old age you will want to so you can be younger
[3:36:04] <Yomamma1337> @mrtanaka111 eye poke is generally better imo
[3:36:08] <MidnightPacif1c> Kilik mains smh
[3:36:21] <%Lion_kun> So once you finish a level, you never have to do it again?
[3:36:23] <user_naim> @rah001 nice
[3:36:23] <penitentpendant> @mrtanaka111 Depends. Sweep gaurantees a weapon drop on minibosses and minions, at least
[3:36:28] <Yomamma1337> @Lion_kun you do
[3:36:32] <+sevorai> main idea is to get a run thorugh where you stay fairly young to beat all the bosses
[3:36:33] <tenshi_q> oh shit he's learning!
[3:36:33] <+Grayhammatter> these dodges... wow
[3:36:40] <a_bald_bro> @Lion_kun if you don't want to but you'll want to
[3:36:46] <FrozenPockets> he might win this one
[3:36:54] <%RyTYoung> @lion_kun you do because you get keys etc from later stages which you can use to access new areas/shortcuts
[3:36:56] <penitentpendant> Get to see that phase 2?
[3:37:03] <%andrewofbob> @Lion_kun You could try never going back, or you can repeat for more permanent skills or lower finishing age
[3:37:12] <+chiazam> It's funny to me that Woolie's gotten good at avoiding Sean's attacks but not other enemies
[3:37:12] <Aussie_Manny> markel6Fighton
[3:37:16] <Aussie_Manny> khadBonk

[3:38:07] <velgaduere> Woolie REALLY wants to punch
[3:38:12] <mrtanaka111> bonk
[3:38:14] <user_naim> and here comes the mix
[3:38:14] <demonborntwice> I know that feeling well.
[3:38:14] <PunkZedB> luckily you're probably gonna have to do another run
[3:38:14] <%jaco_checkbox> the male version's rising sun top knot is better than her her old age hairstyle imo
[3:38:18] <a_bald_bro> you're so close man!!!
[3:38:19] <demonborntwice> Lizard want warm rock.
[3:38:20] <+Bosni9> this is the duck duck duck fight

[3:38:34] <a_bald_bro> damn
[3:38:37] <velgaduere> mute, except "nya~"

[3:38:57] <%RyTYoung> @jaco_checkbox I agree, do still like the ponytail on the lady tho
[3:39:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> getting better
[3:39:01] <nintega010> that did one shot
[3:39:05] <a_bald_bro> just gotta get better on that final duo and you have it
[3:39:05] <T_Sasquatch> @jaco_checkbox male sifu is simply a better design overall , like it feels like they added the female later in development
[3:39:16] <+mechslayer71> yeah you would just re do it anyway
[3:39:16] <jorniev> wow this is really arcadey
[3:39:19] <DXLelouch24> yea you got 3 more levels, 80s no good
[3:39:20] <penitentpendant> Gettin' better (with experience and permanent upgrades)
[3:39:21] <tenshi_q> D:

[3:39:24] <MaybeFalco> D:
[3:39:25] <%Explodincatz> fear the stairs
[3:39:29] <a_bald_bro> you don't HAVE to... but...
[3:39:31] <+sevorai> not the civvies woolie omggg
[3:39:38] <SolidusA> Im too old for this shit
[3:39:39] <demonborntwice> Sean knocked all the goodness out of Woolie's heart in a single strike.
[3:39:43] <tenshi_q> unless you think you get beat the rest of the game at 70 or whatever
[3:39:45] <T_Sasquatch> Don't forget permanent unlocks , you can farm
[3:39:53] <user_naim> what a sick bouncer tho
[3:39:55] <+Mendin> Those wall slams do a healthy chunk of life/poise
[3:39:55] <+chiazam> The civvies don't even give you XP
[3:39:55] <+thewisewolf> the hit sound effects sound so weak
[3:40:19] <niffinbox> you get less shrines with the shortcut too tho
[3:40:25] <SilverFaustX> SourPls
[3:40:25] <a_bald_bro> i wonder if getting to 70 right at the beginning will be the speedrun strat since you do more damage
[3:40:30] <rReizs> peeve doin runs starting at age 75
[3:40:32] <+chiazam> Someday Woolie will try avoiding regular enemy attacks. Someday
[3:40:34] <Aussie_Manny> time for khadBonk
[3:40:36] <%andrewofbob> Woolie's beaten up the cloakroom guy 3 out of 3 times
[3:40:39] <Cyan_Dream> Is this Yakuza 8?
[3:40:42] <+Javaa01> It's almost NEVER worth throwing weapons that aren't bottles or bricks
[3:40:42] <tenshi_q> this stage you can take the shortcut and still get the 3 shrines
[3:40:45] <jorniev> BRUTAL
[3:40:47] <andre11dr> @a_bald_bro People are already doing that
[3:40:47] <%Explodincatz> went straight for the woman I see
[3:40:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FIYA

[3:41:49] <Awesome_Leaf> SourPls
[3:41:51] <+mechslayer71> the number of punch girls in this game is PRECISELY AS HIGH AS IT NEEDS TO BE
[3:41:52] <a_bald_bro> she's at all the emo nights in the club
[3:41:55] <triangularblasphemy> OOOOO THE GLASS
[3:41:56] <lazysaiyajin> getting disco elysium vibe
[3:42:05] <%townzzzzz> regain your youth
[3:42:10] <T_Sasquatch> @andre11dr technically its the dojos club
[3:42:12] <Aussie_Manny> STONE COLD STONE COLD
[3:42:14] <iacus_> do you keep statue upgrades between runs?
[3:42:17] <jorniev> can you get where the DJ is?
[3:42:24] <%SomeAsianDood> no @iacus_
[3:42:26] <+toastybites> @andre11dr cuz its a martial arts trial disguised as a party
[3:42:30] <%andrewofbob> @iacus_ No, only what you carried from previous levels
[3:42:31] <%pi_in_the_sci> no, statue upgrades are lost
[3:42:31] <triangularblasphemy> @mechslayer71 They are such AWESOME designs too!
[3:42:38] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @iacus_ if you restart from the beginning you lose every shrine collected
[3:42:46] <iacus_> ok, better. so you can't grind upgrades
[3:42:53] <Retinolgaming> Just got here, how do they like the game so far?
[3:42:56] <Yomamma1337> @iacus_ if your best clear has a statue you keep it for further levels
[3:43:02] <andre11dr> @t_sasquatch I guess, still actually fighters wouldn't be that skinny
[3:43:03] <+mechslayer71> @triangularblasphemy tats, business casual and suspenders Kreygasm
[3:43:03] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> catJAM
[3:43:12] <DueSquash> Ahhh finally playing Sea Food @WoolieVersus
[3:43:27] <WanderingYoren> focus moves to escape, tight tight tight
[3:43:38] <a_bald_bro> too hyperfocused on people with low posture, you're getting greedy
[3:43:41] <Boegame> this is cool, but it gets minus points for no noodle combos
[3:43:47] <Cymen90> R I S E
[3:43:54] <%KillerFlow> this is the best run yet
[3:44:03] <+Javaa01> Yeah doing this bonus fight doesn't even get him anything, cause he hasn't seen the locked thing this can give a key for
[3:44:14] <triangularblasphemy> @mechslayer71 Long gals, dismissive as shit, wisps of bangs, low platform shoes Kreygasm
[3:44:18] <+chiazam> Fun Fact: the stronger enemies have a glow on their models and health bars, if you don't do a Takedown they don't activate
[3:44:25] <Yomamma1337> parry is the best way of dealing with fodder
[3:44:27] <andre11dr> First death took a while, this might be the one
[3:44:44] <DueSquash> !uptime
[3:44:44] <@Moobot> @DueSquash WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 4 minutes
[3:44:48] <penitentpendant> I laugh that every fight starts with a weapon toss now
[3:44:58] <tenshi_q> i think woolie's biggest problem is he's trying to dodge away from enemies instead of just fighting them head on
[3:45:15] <demonborntwice> It's alright, he'll work it out.
[3:45:20] <wqorst> PUNCH
[3:45:22] <+toastybites> beat him anyways
[3:45:29] <iacus_> the sound control booth
[3:45:32] <WanderingYoren> *sniffing* I smell.....structure
[3:45:35] <tenshi_q> @demonborntwice of course, just an observation
[3:45:46] <demonborntwice> Yep.
[3:45:49] <Aussie_Manny> Replayability.
[3:45:52] <%kyh9> KILL HIM
[3:45:54] <Claw_Iori> one of the lines matters
[3:45:59] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus This NPC becomes relevant after getting to a later level in the game
[3:46:03] <DueSquash> Bonfire Ahead
[3:46:07] <soflicar> check the board?
[3:46:07] <andre11dr> Smack the shit out of him
[3:46:14] <velgaduere> he looked like he was making a kung fu gesture for a moment... are you SURE he doesn't have structure.........
[3:46:17] <Aussie_Manny> Tell him to start playing some Anderson Paak., and leave him be.
[3:46:25] <Tojan89> "where is my elephant"
[3:46:31] <+sevorai> without a doubt the dodge will get you hit more often than not when youre in a group fight
[3:47:07] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm sure this other door will be worth it
[3:47:27] <velgaduere> throws are a godsend in crowds
[3:47:42] <BaslerJones> bonk
[3:47:46] <+sevorai> no I-frames on the dodge
[3:47:47] <user_naim> coney also did really well with this game
[3:47:51] <+chiazam> he dodges way too much
[3:47:55] <%andrewofbob> Don't forget your command normals, @WoolieVersus
[3:47:55] <+Grayhammatter> bonked in the back of the head
[3:48:00] <user_naim> @aussie_manny hell yeah
[3:48:03] <tenshi_q> is he dodging back everytime he parries? or am i crazy
[3:48:14] <Trigon_Trey> Sweep is good
[3:48:18] <+superchronicc> WE MUST KUNG FU FIGHT!
[3:48:21] <+sevorai> he's dodging back instead of parrying and that's what's getting him it
[3:48:28] <+sevorai> but he'll figure it out
[3:48:28] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:49:07] <+superchronicc> he didnt like your style
[3:49:20] <+CrimKangaroo> other door is next to the dance floor
[3:49:36] <Aussie_Manny> üíÄ | 0
[3:49:44] <Pookiedaexzile> So this isn't even the right way
[3:49:56] <penitentpendant> "Gonna look busy for that paycheck."
[3:49:57] <Aussie_Manny> Leave flannel man alone.

[3:50:44] <penitentpendant> Don't swing first... THROW FIRST
[3:50:46] <+Deosier> yeah even the reception guy can back down
[3:50:54] <Yomamma1337> avoid counters them hard
[3:50:57] <+Deosier> it's amazing when they back down
[3:50:58] <Aussie_Manny> Please do not mind Wimp Lo. We purposely trained him wrong, as a joke.
[3:51:02] <Pookiedaexzile> He's Starting to Avoid
[3:51:06] <Kaji04> YOU'RE NOT ALEXANDER
[3:51:07] <%nichos7> He said

[3:54:24] <%Kaito_Cam> donkey punch!
[3:54:25] <jetstreamlove_R> it's like fighting games, it's all about footsies!
[3:54:29] <jetjagger222> getting punched in the back of the head is real bad
[3:54:31] <andre11dr> In the back of the head, you can lose sight from that shit
[3:54:48] <OblivionSword1> L1 back

[3:55:18] <jetstreamlove_R> This game ask nothing but perfection out of ya
[3:55:33] <jetjagger222> oh this motherfucker
[3:55:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[3:55:34] <+superchronicc> @jetstreamlove_R that can be a good thing
[3:55:35] <+Grayhammatter> the one guy
[3:55:35] <andre11dr> How to beat Woolie in Strive; play Potemkin
[3:55:36] <+sevorai> @chiazam he has to dodge those grabs, he just dodged back instead of down
[3:55:44] <penitentpendant> Elbow
[3:55:48] <+superchronicc> now this guy is no joke
[3:55:52] <iacus_> oh this dude
[3:55:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie full of bloodrage
[3:56:00] <+mechslayer71> @andre11dr well, did you see how pat bodied him that one time
[3:56:01] <Captain_Clench> this muthafucka
[3:56:04] <Boegame> hahaha
[3:56:07] <penitentpendant> Violence BREEDS VIOLENCE
[3:56:12] <+Fetrigon> down bad
[3:56:13] <+chiazam> @sevorai I say Avoid instead of Dodge since that's what the game calls it
[3:56:16] <tenshi_q> woolie really getting into the whole revenge thing
[3:56:17] <jetjagger222> walmart liu kang
[3:56:17] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Hopefully ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be friends and not fight‚Äù is a dialogue option
[3:56:31] <iacus_> awise
[3:56:35] <lazysaiyajin> Woolie is immersed in the revenge plot
[3:56:37] <FloatYourGoat> parrying isn't reliable enough, though I even have trouble weaving these guys
[3:56:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Will he Press L1 this time
[3:56:38] <+AWKWARDL0SER> This guy is a whole ordeal he outta challenge the boss himself
[3:56:57] <andre11dr> @mechslayer71 What if Pat was actually way better than Woolie at fighting games this whole time? he was just hiding it
[3:56:59] <jetstreamlove_R> @superchronicc Whit how difficult this game is it is justified whit the length of the game. Really hope it gets dlc expansions
[3:57:01] <stevenellis386> @AWKWARDL0SER something jackie chan would say
[3:57:03] <%jaco_checkbox> gottem
[3:57:03] <Yomamma1337> after a parry you can hit him before you throw
[3:57:03] <+superchronicc> this guy is a pain if you dont have the parry down yet
[3:57:07] <%legacy0117> Good luck bois. Got chores to do. I‚Äôll be back later maybe. SeemsGood
[3:57:09] <Captain_Clench> sick parry

[3:57:14] <+DrDenorax> How is this game?
[3:57:16] <+DrDenorax> It been looking good?
[3:57:23] <iacus_> puched him so hard the room turned blue
[3:57:28] <Yomamma1337> parry=damage,avoid=regain posture,dodge=garbage
[3:57:34] <jetjagger222> is awright, especially if you liked absolver
[3:57:35] <jetstreamlove_R> yeah this game demands you to learn your parries
[3:57:36] <+superchronicc> @jetstreamlove_R how fast to beat this depends on your skills
[3:57:48] <+DrDenorax> Never played Absolver.
[3:58:00] <+superchronicc> @jetstreamlove_R cause its either 8 hours or 30+
[3:58:12] <+sevorai> you could restart to save yourself time
[3:58:24] <jetjagger222> DEAD
[3:58:24] <SoaringTrumpet> LuL

[4:00:04] <andre11dr> And thats how kung fu vs chick boxing actually works kids
[4:00:21] <FloatYourGoat> put whoever is doing a no hit run of this on suicide watch
[4:00:37] <jetstreamlove_R> @superchronicc There's already 20 year (no death0 speedruns and it's something
[4:00:47] <+superchronicc> @FloatYourGoat the only one i know is squillakilla and he does dark souls
[4:00:48] <RabbitsFoot101> @WoolieVersus Gotta try and remember what spots are best to fight people in each room, and where the weapons are.
[4:00:50] <tenshi_q> punching a bag with your bare hands is a terrible idea LUL
[4:00:51] <jetjagger222> so bascally the entirety of the ip man series

[4:04:49] <restingbones> Sorry I though you said to Kick your weapon
[4:05:06] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Enjoy that newfound arrogance while you have it Woolie sheesh üòÖ
[4:05:11] <andre11dr> You know what's better than honor, winning
[4:05:24] <+theoldone001> All I can think of when honor comes up is Bronn in GoT fighting the Moon door knight guy.
[4:05:30] <ZE_Count> so just got here woolie like game?
[4:05:32] <+mechslayer71> @awkwardl0ser that museum is gonna blow that bussy up

[4:06:21] <+MiraLangsuir> Oh, some Hung Gar in here?
[4:06:26] <+das_sensentier> das_sensentier subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[4:06:32] <zenith0111> Losing to normal jobbers smh
[4:06:37] <bywayIdler> Yeah, this pair is a FRUSTRATING fight.
[4:06:38] <Captain_Clench> Yoooooooo
[4:06:38] <jetstreamlove_R> https://clips.twitch.tv/HungryResilientRadicchioCoolStoryBob-N5i4zEkeWT9mpD8r
[4:06:49] <%RyTYoung> You gotta know when you need to start avoiding
[4:06:56] <+sevorai> You could go from parry into a throw to stop his combo too i think
[4:07:00] <+theoldone001> Damn, right in the Uvula
[4:07:01] <+superchronicc> dude is one shot too, it stings
[4:07:02] <jetjagger222> JUNEN HAIYAINDAYO
[4:07:03] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Less game is fire but I could never play it
[4:07:07] <+Grayhammatter> jeez, these guys are the real deal
[4:07:08] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> bicycle kick
[4:07:10] <zenith0111> OMG WHAT
[4:07:16] <%RyTYoung> I always forget to use my focus
[4:07:25] <jetjagger222> oof
[4:07:27] <jetjagger222> good run
[4:07:30] <andre11dr> That looked wierd but ok
[4:07:32] <zenith0111> Game dont fuck around
[4:07:39] <Pookiedaexzile> L1 will save your life
[4:07:40] <%RyTYoung> This game is ruthless
[4:07:45] <zenith0111> Im not used to AI that properly defends
[4:07:47] <tenshi_q> if you block the orange attack
[4:07:57] <demonborntwice> I think spot dodge/avoid might be better, actually.
[4:08:00] <Onamar> L1 Evade is better
[4:08:01] <Captain_Clench> i always side dodge the last punch
[4:08:03] <OblivionSword1> how about swaying all 3 attacks
[4:08:09] <+kwameflame> kwameflame subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:08:11] <%RyTYoung> L1 evade is 100% better than dodging
[4:08:14] <+sevorai> side dodge would be safer because of the reach that last 3rd hit has
[4:08:16] <%RyTYoung> If you want space sprint
[4:08:22] <+superchronicc> i like to try to parry the first blow on muay thai fighters, then dodge the third jab on the end for focus gain
[4:08:23] <+Jasek7> i found leg sweep extra good
[4:08:25] <tenshi_q> also yeah R2 dodge is trash
[4:08:31] <Aussie_Manny> Parrying is cooler, but sadly dodging must be done.
[4:08:37] <Boegame> immediatly boddied :V
[4:08:39] <jetstreamlove_R> The skillcheck boss fight
[4:08:42] <+theoldone001> Might need to Steve Fox side dodge that shit
[4:08:48] <PunishedFurby> look at these dodges!!! noice!
[4:09:07] <+mdhopper> When you parry enemies, you have to parry on like, their last hit to be able to do the little "block and quick punch animation" Use L1 and Mashing Down on the left stick to bob and weave like god hand against those dudes, builds up your structure
[4:09:07] <+valiard> that was slick
[4:09:16] <zenith0111> WHAT WOOLIE
[4:09:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA

[4:11:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolies too brave to evade
[4:11:14] <Boegame> i feel like woolie is pressing them buttons too fast and paniced, this feels like a more of a slower, rythmic game, like sekiro
[4:11:17] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> Crain kick that dude
[4:11:20] <user_naim> @jetstreamlove_r they‚Äôre good combos though
[4:11:23] <+QuestJefferson> What if you were kicking someone's ass and they just Became Old in front of you
[4:11:26] <zenith0111> MAGIC IS REAL
[4:11:29] <+ghostfaceninja_> Shishio vibes with the fire and the bandages
[4:11:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolies Bravery will not allow for a Dodge
[4:11:31] <+sniffy77> i see woolie is a man of culture
[4:11:33] <genmypoweralready> Oh hey I've never seen anyone pick the female
[4:11:34] <+Ornightz> you can hold X to skip @WoolieVersus
[4:11:35] <+TheMilkiestShake> Game feels really frustrating at times for me
[4:11:35] <RickyRelucent> the netherrealm
[4:11:37] <Boegame> at least from observation, haven't played it myself

[4:12:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FINISH HIM
[4:12:07] <Sapphire_Breeze> you picked the wrong club fool
[4:12:09] <+superchronicc> woolie's character is starting to look like lady butterfly
[4:12:10] <+theoldone001> Same fight just firestick?
[4:12:14] <+sevorai> shofuNODDERS shofuNODDERS shofuNODDERS
[4:12:15] <+ghostfaceninja_> those floor textures change when he walks
[4:12:24] <+sevorai> he adds some feints now
[4:12:29] <jetjagger222> that fast low is super tricky
[4:12:30] <RickyRelucent> *sticky fingas.mp 3*
[4:12:33] <%RyTYoung> Avoid everything
[4:12:33] <%emptyantics> Sweep the leg
[4:12:37] <%RyTYoung> Then stun
[4:12:39] <BaslerJones> this age mechanic is pretty weird
[4:12:40] <andre11dr> One more death
[4:12:42] <user_naim> that poke is fucked good
[4:12:42] <velgaduere> @theoldone001 he has a phase 2, plus there are no more weapons in the arena iirc
[4:12:44] <+superchronicc> can you dodge the sweep, i could never do it
[4:12:45] <+Deekman> how far in to the game is this?
[4:12:48] <penitentpendant> @theoldone001 More punishment for getting hit
[4:12:48] <Pookiedaexzile> If only there was a way to AVOID damage
[4:12:51] <zenith0111> Dont let defeat seep into your heart
[4:12:55] <+chiazam> Let him set the pace
[4:12:55] <jetstreamlove_R> Looks like you gotta wait for him to finish his combo before you retaliate
[4:12:57] <%RyTYoung> @superchronicc yeah
[4:12:59] <bywayIdler> @superchronicc Yep.
[4:13:00] <FloatYourGoat> legit never got that God damn low attack down
[4:13:01] <BlackermanZX> dont forget focus
[4:13:01] <user_naim> @deekman second boss
[4:13:04] <jetjagger222> @BaslerJones its basically a fancier continues mechanic
[4:13:06] <velgaduere> @theoldone001 or an enrage, I should say. man gets crazy with backdashes at a point
[4:13:06] <%erod_> use meter
[4:13:07] <OblivionSword1> that low is a killer
[4:13:08] <tenshi_q> @Deekman stage 2 of 5
[4:13:10] <Boegame> grinding that granma into the floor :V
[4:13:13] <+chiazam> Bug?
[4:13:18] <+NobuuNobuu> the floor is going wonky where he steps weird
[4:13:27] <xxHungryxx> Monk class is overrated, just play a Barbarian üòè
[4:13:28] <+ghostfaceninja_> this boss, and this phase in particular, is a wall. I've seen several streamers give up here
[4:13:30] <penitentpendant> @Boegame Phrasing!

[4:14:29] <pepinillomaton> ground counter helps a lot
[4:14:30] <andre11dr> TOASTIE
[4:14:34] <jetstreamlove_R> We got data on him now!
[4:14:34] <velgaduere> phase 2 is all about building focus with spot dodge
[4:14:34] <Captain_Clench> good run
[4:14:35] <%pi_in_the_sci> sweeps work good on him
[4:14:39] <%CoffeeSlice> LUL
[4:14:41] <DeathByPoke7> yeah he is much more defensive phase 3
[4:14:42] <+sevorai> phase 2 it looked liek he was getting more and more on fire as tiem progressed
[4:14:47] <RickyRelucent> damn hip replacement messing me up
[4:14:50] <gunstars20> No LUL
[4:14:52] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> he also Fe
[4:14:53] <user_naim> he hit that Giovanna 2D on you
[4:14:54] <+chiazam> This might be a good time to go back to the Squats and get a better start on this level
[4:14:55] <+andGalactus1> I find it so hard to do sweeps in actual battle
[4:14:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Lets try Avoidance
[4:14:58] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:15:03] <SheepGetGud> to me he was actually the easiest boss in the game
[4:15:05] <Aussie_Manny> Your precious youth! Gratefully accepted!
[4:15:05] <tenshi_q> all that confidence... where'd it go?
[4:15:06] <zenith0111> Bad Bouncers btw
[4:15:10] <andre11dr> Not with that attitude
[4:15:13] <jetjagger222> have confidence
[4:15:13] <jetstreamlove_R> These hands are my list
[4:15:21] <+Ornightz> You can use the Shortcuts to skip most fights and some areas in the club you don't need to engage combat
[4:15:21] <Parapattern> Wouldn't your bouncer be the toughest guy?
[4:15:22] <%andrewofbob> 4 out of 4
[4:15:22] <xxHungryxx> All this over some Dim Sum smh
[4:15:23] <velgaduere> damn, what happened to Just Talk? doodSad
[4:15:26] <+Gorgonzolini> @SheepGetGud Kuroki really messed me up for a while
[4:15:32] <penitentpendant> I like how speedruns of this are just going to look like you're a villain with all the running SMASHES you do on folks
[4:15:32] <zenith0111> @parapattern Apparently not lmaooo
[4:15:36] <tenshi_q> ye, stage 2 boss is trivial when you learn his pattern and git gud at evading
[4:15:36] <LittleSiberianBear> i see, so peace is not an option anymore?
[4:15:37] <+mechslayer71> @chiazam he's 26, it doesn't get way better than that. the exponential nature of aging kinda makes that many levels of difference not matter much

[4:16:12] <user_naim> i‚Äôm here for it
[4:16:14] <+Fetrigon> just like the player character LUL
[4:16:16] <+chiazam> @mechslayer71 I've gotten here at 23 with a death counter of 0, so there's definitely much better
[4:16:20] <jetjagger222> no talk, just punch
[4:16:29] <+theoldone001> Need environmental weapon attacks, that shit is game changing tbh
[4:16:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:16:43] <RickyRelucent> wonder if the game comes with a boss rush
[4:16:44] <zenith0111> Woolie is getting fucking jumped
[4:16:49] <demonborntwice> Oof!
[4:16:51] <penitentpendant> Supahman
[4:16:52] <genmypoweralready> Superman punched
[4:16:53] <+chiazam> Keeping your death counter at 0 is an attainable goal
[4:16:56] <jetjagger222> @theoldone001 yakuza spoils so much in that department
[4:16:57] <+Deekman> god this reminds me of jackie chan stuntmaster on ps1
[4:16:57] <xxHungryxx> Superman punch
[4:17:00] <xxHungryxx> lol
[4:17:12] <velgaduere> LMAO
[4:17:14] <+mechslayer71> @chiazam no, I'm saying if he dies enough times in a row and they stack up, 3 years of difference and the lower death counter may give him like, one extra life

[4:17:57] <Estwilde> good beats in this game
[4:17:59] <+TheMeromex> music really reminds me of hotline miami
[4:18:02] <jetjagger222> this is streets of rage
[4:18:19] <+chiazam> @mechslayer71 To me every year counts, since you get locked out of rewards and skills the higher you are in age
[4:18:30] <+mechslayer71> thats fair
[4:18:38] <RickyRelucent> absolver teampolished this to fuck apparantly
[4:18:45] <+oAznoUta> yo I just picked up the soundtrack for this.  shit slaps hard
[4:18:50] <%RyTYoung> Remember Jade statues heal you fully too @woolieversus
[4:18:53] <jetstreamlove_R> There's no shame in running, divide and conquer
[4:18:56] <Parapattern> FIGHT ME COWARD
[4:18:56] <RickyRelucent> is it that team? i forget
[4:19:03] <jetjagger222> nice fight skip
[4:19:07] <+ghostfaceninja_> so what's the consensus, is this a beat-em-up or no?
[4:19:12] <WanderingYoren> @RickyRelucent slowclap is the dev iirc
[4:19:13] <user_naim> if sloclap just keeps making fight games i‚Äôll buy their whole catalogue
[4:19:23] <zenith0111> I appreciate the number of punch girls in this
[4:19:29] <tenshi_q> define beat em up
[4:19:39] <RickyRelucent> cheers my good man
[4:19:41] <DueSquash> Just saw someone do a no hit 75yr old speedrun... My goodness
[4:19:47] <WanderingYoren> np
[4:19:47] <%RyTYoung> OMG THE GANG
[4:19:55] <zenith0111> BRIDGE FIGHT
[4:20:04] <+theoldone001> A martial arts Souls like would be fun, just kung fu hollows and shit.
[4:20:07] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Woolie with the Galaxy brain!
[4:20:08] <xxHungryxx> don't need skill if you have numbers
[4:20:13] <Captain_Clench> kung fu department of Team Magma
[4:20:18] <Boegame> for speedruning purpouses, its probably good to put yourself in 75 for max damage
[4:20:20] <+mechslayer71> where's the taunts, woolie? get that multiplier up Kappa
[4:20:26] <WanderingYoren> it'll never not fuck with me how people solve these games on day 1
[4:20:28] <+ghostfaceninja_> double dragon, streets of rage, river city girls, castle crashers, battletoads,etc
[4:20:33] <+Deekman> do you keep your perks every run or start fresh every time you go back to the start?
[4:20:51] <LittleSiberianBear> @Deekman both
[4:20:56] <zenith0111> Thats sicks
[4:21:08] <genmypoweralready> The health absorb on KO upgrade makes these big group fights more of a resource than a danger
[4:21:11] <LittleSiberianBear> @Deekman some things you have to need to unlock permanantly. they are MUCH more expensive to do that
[4:21:22] <leomuratore> Shmoovin
[4:21:22] <RickyRelucent> if taunts dont change context due to combo countrr imma feel acertain way
[4:21:23] <%RyTYoung> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:21:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Its not worth the fight here
[4:21:27] <jetstreamlove_R> grunt thought he was a protag LUL
[4:22:07] <+SiegmundCG> just use a focus move and throw her off the edge easy
[4:22:20] <+Gorgonzolini> @RickyRelucent they change based on your age
[4:22:26] <jetstreamlove_R> optional fight is just for extra xp
[4:22:35] <RickyRelucent> oOoO
[4:22:35] <zhenthrim213> the damn disrespect
[4:22:38] <jetstreamlove_R> No respect on her name LUL
[4:22:41] <zenith0111> Club into Mystical Hidden Dojo
[4:22:44] <niffinbox> you cant interact with doors in a fight
[4:23:13] <zenith0111> I bet the game has cool lore
[4:23:24] <+ghostfaceninja_> has Woolie made it past Sean yet?
[4:23:30] <Futurecity10> cheer500 I cant say I'm skilled that I got to bloody palace 100 since Vergil is the most powerful character in the game if you know how to cheese. For example you can pop SDT at level 2 concentration you can pull off 3-4 End of the worlds or Judgment cuts which will usually instant kill all bosses. Or that you can use Beowolf to parry every thing just by jumping around the area and mashing summon swords to build concentration and DT. The only hard counter to this is artemis and chevalier angelo.
[4:23:30] <+mechslayer71> nope
[4:23:41] <+mechslayer71> 3 deaths I believe @ghostfaceninja_
[4:23:47] <ElPlasa> *Laughs in Tekken*
[4:23:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[4:23:48] <+mechslayer71> and I mean game overs
[4:23:59] <@Menitta> was gonna say, Tekken is weird
[4:23:59] <Awesome_Leaf> tekken logic
[4:24:08] <%andrewofbob> This sounds very Namco
[4:24:10] <Boegame> the REAL boss fight :V
[4:24:10] <xbb1024> hello
[4:24:11] <xxHungryxx> Image having to have to have a staff fight with Billy from KoF? @woolieversus
[4:24:22] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[4:24:30] <pepinillomaton> 33 is good
[4:24:33] <%andrewofbob> Soul Calibur has that thing where crouching eats mids but avoids highs
[4:24:38] <Onamar> Evaaaade
[4:24:44] <Cozy90> huuuua!
[4:25:05] <Pookiedaexzile> EVADE
[4:25:07] <+sevorai> back dash gives absolutely no i-frames for attacks with reach
[4:25:12] <+aishman> Something that helps me in some big fights is if you do the focus attack to grab and push them into a wall and then go for a combo
[4:25:31] <Boegame> the walls seem to do a lot of damage
[4:25:31] <+bo_dangus> bo_dangus subscribed with Prime. 
[4:25:37] <Pookiedaexzile> L1
[4:25:40] <RickyRelucent> @aish like vatman! c:
[4:25:40] <tenshi_q> i always found the best way to deal with these guys is 2 parries and an evade
[4:25:50] <SaiyanShoto> This is the toughest fight of this level
[4:25:53] <Yomamma1337> you can parry the first couple hits
[4:25:55] <%working4theknife> working4theknife subscribed with Prime. 
[4:26:04] <Gadagast> these palm strike fucks are so annoying
[4:26:08] <user_naim> i love these fuckers
[4:26:14] <spaghettiweaver> this guy is sifu
[4:26:17] <xbb1024> is Woolie doing good?
[4:26:27] <Picosunloaded> get that parry in boi
[4:26:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Define "Good"
[4:26:35] <LittleSiberianBear> @spaghettiweaver this guy are sick
[4:26:41] <user_naim> woolie is learning
[4:26:54] <user_naim> learning is the greatest good of all
[4:26:57] <%DashXero> How does evasion feel/work in this game?
[4:26:58] <%RyTYoung> It takes practice @woolieversus time to lab Kappa
[4:27:03] <alroy909> those two are tough
[4:27:11] <tenshi_q> evade is R1+Left Stick and R2 is dodge, dodge is trash
[4:27:17] <Yomamma1337> @tenshi_q l1
[4:27:21] <Awesome_Leaf> total
[4:27:25] <%RyTYoung> @tenshi_q L1
[4:27:26] <tenshi_q> ye mb
[4:27:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Just Spam L1
[4:27:39] <user_naim> they are scarier than they are tough. 3 palm strike is free damage
[4:27:41] <+aishman> @woolieversus Don't forget when you use your focus attack they are in a staggered state which means you can do ANYTHING from knock down to grab and push
[4:27:45] <%DashXero> Ah. thanks, guys!
[4:27:46] <exclamatia> woolay
[4:28:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> The wall splat
[4:28:22] <user_naim> people usually evade too early (me included)
[4:28:29] <RickyRelucent> ehhh, not too hard getting to this pont
[4:28:31] <RickyRelucent> point
[4:28:32] <+AWKWARDL0SER> He‚Äôs like a MK sub boss
[4:28:50] <orangerainbow> you gotta do the head weave rather than the full backdash
[4:28:53] <mrtanaka111> easy fight
[4:28:54] <aawnlvado> the game is pretty lenient with mashing the bob and weave like in godhand against those guys
[4:29:00] <Pookiedaexzile> See how they are doing it you
[4:29:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> just win
[4:29:07] <TigerClaws12> parry window is tighter than sekiro, it's like 6 frames LUL
[4:29:08] <%RyTYoung> @rickyrelucent it‚Äôs not really, it‚Äôs just about keeping your deaths to a minimum each run you do
[4:29:09] <mrtanaka111> git gud
[4:29:11] <Yomamma1337> r2 is garbage fyi
[4:29:12] <FloatYourGoat> is he too slow on the follow up parry?
[4:29:18] <zygomurf> you're doing great woolie!
[4:29:23] <SaiyanShoto> She‚Äôs looking fine at 58
[4:29:26] <mrtanaka111> youre doing ok woolie

[4:32:12] <AngryAsian5> DAMN
[4:32:18] <AngryAsian5> I felt that hit, Jesus LUL
[4:32:19] <andre11dr> Cleansing those flames
[4:32:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOOR
[4:32:21] <+invader_rin> The sweep and the overhead always gets me
[4:32:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[4:32:28] <andre11dr> Unless
[4:32:30] <gunstars20> ow
[4:32:38] <tenshi_q> the low
[4:32:38] <demonborntwice> Just gotta learn his patterns.
[4:32:39] <%mr_sups> That dude's VO work is so Dull
[4:32:39] <%working4theknife> OUCH
[4:32:42] <andre11dr> !uptime
[4:32:42] <@Moobot> @andre11dr WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 52 minutes
[4:32:53] <Vertlos> Vertlos subscribed with Prime. 
[4:33:03] <+aishman> Remember you CAN parry the overhead if you parry it just right
[4:33:08] <Superblooms> honestly all the VO is pretty dull, weakest part of the game
[4:33:09] <%RyTYoung> There is no horizontal avoiding
[4:33:14] <aawnlvado> he's only got one low, but it's a combo opener in phase 2
[4:33:30] <+aishman> No.
[4:33:32] <henshin2289> You your passive buffs reset
[4:33:37] <RickyRelucent> no jump avoid?
[4:33:41] <RickyRelucent> sadge
[4:33:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> what's the highest age you can possibly hit? anyone done the math?
[4:33:48] <tenshi_q> the warning is real weird
[4:33:51] <+aishman> It's just dodge
[4:33:54] <%sporeian94> I just learned there's a Age of Empire II multiplayer match that's streaming for 60+ hours now with no end in site
[4:34:02] <%Namillus> 79 absolute highest I think?
[4:34:03] <Cymen90> Labbing in a single player game.
[4:34:10] <henshin2289> @rickyrelucent there‚Äôs a jump avoid
[4:34:16] <%RyTYoung> Practice avoiding on this dude will help you get a feel for it
[4:34:18] <+aishman> @reallybigrocks I hit 79 once. Probably the highest.
[4:34:18] <spaghettiweaver> @sporeian94 are you an ad
[4:34:20] <demonborntwice> @Cymen90 That's what you do for this game.
[4:34:31] <demonborntwice> Gotta learn kung fu.
[4:34:33] <+chiazam> The DLC should let you change the type of enemy available for training
[4:34:34] <%sporeian94> no I'm just letting chat know and woolie cause that's INSANE to me
[4:34:35] <%slayabee> You can dodge and/or block into a parry as well
[4:34:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Wait He might have seen it
[4:34:44] <user_naim> @sporeian94 that is pretty cool
[4:34:49] <%andrewofbob> @sporeian94 That would surely mean the map is mined out; are they just trading gold for increasingly inflated costs?
[4:34:51] <DeathByPoke7> option selects
[4:35:00] <gunstars20> ah we doing OS
[4:35:05] <SILENTBOB22> He's  beginning to believe
[4:35:15] <SILENTBOB22> He's beginning to believe
[4:35:16] <+sevorai> it's just that the golden hits will hurt for more composure
[4:35:18] <RickyRelucent> @spore shit i need to preorder total warhammer 3 for ogres ty for jogging my memory
[4:35:22] <+aishman> You need to in some fights
[4:35:22] <+chiazam> Oh my god has he been tapping block and the stick
[4:35:22] <CommandantKobold> !motivated
[4:35:23] <@Moobot> @CommandantKobold 2511 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:35:24] <mrtanaka111> oh no,hes begginign to lab
[4:35:24] <+chiazam> OOF
[4:35:34] <niffinbox> the direction is just back for high forward for sweeps
[4:35:35] <user_naim> @chiazam oh my god he has
[4:35:42] <tenshi_q> you can interrupt if you get the slowdown
[4:35:45] <%slayabee> After a dodge he is able to be hit and thrown iirc
[4:35:46] <%sporeian94> From what I've heard the dodge is way more useful than the parry in this game
[4:35:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie went to the lab fucked around learned something
[4:35:47] <+Babooboomin> unless it's a sweep
[4:35:48] <user_naim> well that explains it
[4:35:52] <%slayabee> once you get a slo mo
[4:35:58] <%andrewofbob> It looks like you can't change lab-man's moveset
[4:36:02] <DeathByPoke7> not enough tools on the lab
[4:36:02] <%Kaito_Cam> This isn't a great lab
[4:36:04] <mrtanaka111> labing is his drug
[4:36:05] <Yomamma1337> hitting after a dodge should interrupt
[4:36:07] <%pi_in_the_sci> first level is better lab
[4:36:09] <henshin2289> Unblockable doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúnot parryable‚Äù
[4:36:14] <Aussie_Manny> In Ghost of Tsushima, blue shines on enemy attacks are parryable, and red shines are not.
[4:36:17] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Restart from a different profile and do the dream sequence opening against him again?
[4:36:24] <+invader_rin> I wish you can pick bosses as your AI
[4:36:37] <%slayabee> Some attacks can't be parried tho
[4:36:39] <%andrewofbob> Seems not all parries stop the chain
[4:36:46] <Yomamma1337> @slayabee grabs cant be parried
[4:36:47] <niffinbox> soft parry is a thing too
[4:37:06] <+chiazam> @slayabee It's rough because I have parried some red attacks
[4:37:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> your parries are too soft
[4:37:14] <%andrewofbob> Game's starting to flicker the screen
[4:37:22] <+mechslayer71> the best way to learn is by doing
[4:37:22] <@Menitta> it's a bit lacking in a lab yeah
[4:37:27] <+chiazam> I think it's just not worth it to try parrying them
[4:37:27] <%slayabee> Its trial and error to figure out which is which
[4:37:28] <@Menitta> still really good
[4:37:29] <stevenellis386> I gotta get this game
[4:37:36] <Afrosamasenpai> yeeee they do it
[4:37:36] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Is this the run?
[4:37:37] <andre11dr> Clap
[4:37:37] <Aussie_Manny> lytCLAP
[4:37:42] <stevenellis386> gotta try this myself
[4:37:44] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:37:46] <+mechslayer71> is this a whole playthrough?
[4:37:47] <SaiyanShoto> üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
[4:37:47] <@Menitta> i bought this game because of this stream and it's REAL GOOD
[4:37:48] <%slayabee> I legit didn't know you could parry the sweep until I saw woolie do it today
[4:37:49] <AngryAsian5> Clap
[4:37:49] <BlackermanZX> clap woolieFROG
[4:37:50] <+storkeylope> lytCLAP
[4:37:54] <%emperordread> Have I been influenced into a purchase?

[4:38:05] <SaiyanShoto> Those twins are the true boss of the club
[4:38:05] <Aussie_Manny> Give this studio an IP to adapt!
[4:38:05] <niffinbox> clap clap
[4:38:08] <andre11dr> woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB
[4:38:10] <Cymen90> Coward lol
[4:38:13] <Yomamma1337> @slayabee you can parry everything but grabs iirc
[4:38:13] <TigerClaws12> he's addicted
[4:38:16] <Aussie_Manny> I'd love a John Wick or Shang-chi of this.
[4:38:18] <+Jiggisnipe> so I did some grinding off screen Kappa
[4:38:20] <tenshi_q> make a second save?
[4:38:20] <demonborntwice> "So I did some runs offscreen..."
[4:38:23] <+invader_rin> Grind for exp
[4:38:28] <+valiard> that's the sigh of a good game right there
[4:38:29] <+Kyma1020> doesn't have to be an lp
[4:38:32] <%RyTYoung> So I lied there is horizontal avoiding I just felt like I was mashing back L1 and it was dodging to the left half the time
[4:38:34] <Yomamma1337> get that age 20 3 shrine win
[4:38:35] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus get your best runs, backdown when bout to beat boss
[4:38:36] <raikagelord1> Yes that is smart.
[4:38:36] <PunishedFurby> it's within your grasp!
[4:38:37] <penitentpendant> Redo the first stage until finish it at 20?
[4:38:38] <NeonBleu> No hit run coming soon
[4:38:39] <Cymen90> A yes, the transformation into PAT has begun
[4:38:40] <AngryAsian5> Gonna grind off-screen LUL
[4:38:44] <niffinbox> grind for xp do it
[4:38:48] <+aishman> @woolieversus A tip: You can focus attack into a grab and push the enemies into a wall and then do combo. It helps A LOT
[4:38:49] <RickyRelucent> show us the fruits of your labor
[4:38:52] <andre11dr> Oh i thought this was a one off
[4:38:53] <raikagelord1> Get that age down + XP
[4:38:57] <andre11dr> LUL
[4:38:58] <@Menitta> a John Wick game would actually work with this kind of close combat gameplay
[4:39:00] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus grind for permanent unlocks offscreen
[4:39:04] <+storkeylope> This reminds me a whole lot like God Hand
[4:39:07] <%RyTYoung> Ofc not
[4:39:12] <+Jiggisnipe> would a 2nd save work?
[4:39:14] <%Prevot> is this a full LP?
[4:39:21] <%Bread_Assassin> Are we gonna come back with Woolie starting the club at 20?
[4:39:21] <RickyRelucent> menitta, there is a john wick game
[4:39:22] <velgaduere> sure
[4:39:23] <+Babooboomin> yes
[4:39:24] <DXLelouch24> that works
[4:39:25] <velgaduere> sounds good
[4:39:28] <+mechslayer71> okay Pat :)
[4:39:28] <DeathByPoke7> lab the tough guys
[4:39:29] <DXLelouch24> NO 3rd level tho
[4:39:29] <%RyTYoung> You could‚Ä¶
[4:39:30] <DXLelouch24> NO
[4:39:32] <DXLelouch24> bad
[4:39:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> fair enough
[4:39:33] <@Menitta> Play it absolutely
[4:39:38] <+theoldone001> So what's the consensus on woolieFROG ??
[4:39:39] <T_Sasquatch> @menitta I've heard people say this but i feel like john wick is more gunplay than hand to hand
[4:39:39] <+Babooboomin> you have to learn in the pit Lol
[4:39:40] <DXLelouch24> chat gonna wanna see that
[4:39:40] <+aishman> Yeah just get some permanent unlocks
[4:39:40] <%RyTYoung> Or just grind offscreen for skills? LUL
[4:39:45] <penitentpendant> Woolie got that CRAVIN'
[4:39:47] <+aishman> Increase that list
[4:39:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Become Lab Rat
[4:40:04] <T_Sasquatch> "practice" he's gonna beat the game from sheer hype
[4:40:11] <%RyTYoung> Grind that first stage into the dust
[4:40:16] <BlackermanZX> Get Into Sifu on saturday soon woolieFROG
[4:40:16] <andre11dr> So how long is this game?
[4:40:24] <@Menitta> @t_sasquatch of course but I mean mechanically, it should be the feel and core design of this but at a range with guns
[4:40:27] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie is influencing Reggie
[4:40:34] <niffinbox> use the shrine before the boss to spend your xp then restart
[4:40:37] <RickyRelucent> just a little, dont ruin all the fun
[4:40:37] <tenshi_q> Reggie gonna come back the master
[4:40:40] <%RyTYoung> Can we expect a PvP mode coming soon? gigaboOtsMJowMAX
[4:40:44] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus if you think about it Sifu IS a fighting game? just play it again this Saturday
[4:40:44] <SaiyanShoto> Practicing helps a lot, I kept going back and doing the squats until I could no death it and it helped
[4:40:46] <RickyRelucent> PowerUpL FUNgineer PowerUpR
[4:41:01] <%Double_Tap_That> @rytyoung That would just be Absolcer again.
[4:41:07] <%Namillus> GET INTO SIFU
[4:41:22] <DeathByPoke7> I feel like this is the first 3d game that feels like an old 2d beatemup

[4:41:48] <Aussie_Manny> It's that complicated? Jeez.
[4:41:56] <RickyRelucent> maybe they do but the bot will or will not so
[4:42:06] <T_Sasquatch> @menitta that would be hot , have you heard of "my friend Pedro", apart from vanquish there's not many stylish shooters
[4:42:08] <RickyRelucent> no time wasted thinkibg
[4:42:11] <Yomamma1337> I dont see anyone referencing that issue online
[4:42:31] <@Menitta> I need to play that it looked cool @t_sasquatch
[4:43:29] <DeathByPoke7> oh that's crazy
[4:43:30] <+Jiggisnipe> oh
[4:43:37] <Trigon_Trey> Woooow
[4:43:43] <DXLelouch24> oh so never do Squats again till im a god
[4:43:44] <T_Sasquatch> Yikes
[4:43:48] <DXLelouch24> cause i beat it at 21
[4:43:49] <Aussie_Manny> Ooohhhh.
[4:44:06] <RickyRelucent> cmonBruh
[4:44:09] <Colby_DJ> @DXLelouch24 or just die once intentionally
[4:44:12] <tenshi_q> basically if you beat a level at 20 you are stuck with that run
[4:44:16] <zenith0111> Wtf?!
[4:44:28] <T_Sasquatch> My head
[4:44:29] <%working4theknife> DAMN
[4:44:31] <Yomamma1337> @WoolieVersus theyre just saying that your latest run is whats kept for future levels
[4:44:34] <BlackermanZX> damn thats an oversight
[4:44:36] <zenith0111> Someone got that written down?
[4:44:40] <%Prevot> NotLikeThis
[4:44:48] <%DashXero> So... When will they patch it?
[4:44:52] <T_Sasquatch> Good message tho !
[4:44:52] <Darren716> Uhh what'd I miss?
[4:44:56] <+Exicuren> I got it
[4:45:03] <@Menitta> I think I follow
[4:45:07] <Aussie_Manny> Whoa. No death? Well played.
[4:45:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:45:27] <@Menitta> there's no doubt an achievement for doing a perfect run lol
[4:45:42] <tenshi_q> theres an achievement for beating the game at 25 or lower
[4:45:44] <+theoldone001> Sounds like a more hardcore SL1 run LUL
[4:46:13] <niffinbox> itll get patched to sort that out
[4:46:47] <@Menitta> Returnal got a suspend
[4:46:51] <%Bread_Assassin> So you DON‚ÄôT want to use shortcuts when you‚Äôre going for your perfect run?
[4:46:54] <sandwhichpeddler> That Returnal patch came out, just 6 months later
[4:46:55] <Arancet> returnal got patched
[4:46:58] <tenshi_q> i got some upgrades i got stuck with on the squats that i didn't like by the time i got to the final boss but fuck me i guess
[4:47:00] <Jspeed8th> Returnal did get patched
[4:47:07] <@Menitta> a little too late but still lol
[4:47:13] <vstpnv> yeah returnal did get patched a few months ago @WoolieVersus
[4:47:27] <Jspeed8th> You can suspend in Returnal now like Demon‚Äôs Souls thanks to a patxh
[4:47:28] <Aussie_Manny> !MOTIVATED lytMOTIVATED
[4:47:28] <@Moobot> @Aussie_Manny 2512 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:47:31] <andre11dr> Well you can also cheese it with Dante
[4:47:38] <zenith0111> Everyone has 1 super over powered attack yeah even V
[4:47:41] <%dds333a> Red Hot
[4:47:44] <tenshi_q> @Bread_Assassin depends on the level, like on stage 2 you can get all the upgrades and still use the shortcut
[4:47:44] <zenith0111> V and his Laser
[4:47:50] <andre11dr> STD pretty much can clear whole floors
[4:47:57] <RickyRelucent> royal release
[4:48:01] <RickyRelucent> c:

[4:48:31] <RickyRelucent> i miss dreadnaught dt
[4:48:39] <@Menitta> What's interesting is at the end of BP, I found the Vergil mirror match much harder than Dante and Nero
[4:48:51] <+superchronicc> vergil seems more snappy than the other charcters
[4:48:57] <jetstreamlove_R> Except Vergil does the quadruple S whitout the need of being in SSS whit his SIn DT LUL
[4:49:00] <andre11dr> To me ,BP is the easiest with Dante
[4:49:20] <BreakfastSampler> it's in the blood, it's IN the blood
[4:49:29] <andre11dr> He just has so many crowd control tools
[4:49:36] <@Menitta> I need to train
