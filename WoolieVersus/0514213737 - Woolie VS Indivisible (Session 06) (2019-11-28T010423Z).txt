[2:13:02] <BreakersAweigh> one of my biggest issues with this game was the lack of fast travel in between locations. so traveling back to baozhai's ship from mara's den takes forever

[2:29:56] <@Solidus_113> And don't forget to get that defense upgrade now
[2:29:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:30:00] <prime_name> Where we at?
[2:30:15] <fist_wizard_jay> The Baz Hole
[2:30:24] <+tankusmaximus7> @prime_name Gonna teach Kala a “lesson”
[2:30:32] <prime_name> Oh good, he found Yan and Zarah.
[2:30:34] <Thunderhog> Well technically 17 of those are all in your head so...
[2:30:41] <Thunderhog> It's basicly just a really heavy package
[2:30:47] <Thunderhog> ....woolie calling me out ISTANTLY
[2:30:54] <fist_wizard_jay> When your son turns you into a jobber
[2:31:02] <Mendin> Thorani actually left peacefully when Baz asked, everyone else got chucked out
[2:31:30] <fist_wizard_jay> instant jobber on camera
[2:31:36] <Graxe_> So if you give Baz a Raging Demon, he's at his most powerful?
[2:31:40] <Novillion> So he has stage fright?
[2:31:41] <+Ancopro> sure you want to
[2:31:44] <+Ancopro> its really not
[2:31:46] <@Solidus_113> now we get the good shit on defense
[2:31:52] <+JingKaisean> what's more divisive, this or DS?
[2:32:03] <fist_wizard_jay> this
[2:32:25] <fist_wizard_jay> the argument on the podcast between Pat and Woolie was substantially larger
[2:32:50] <oAznoUta> The Baz is Orange Cassidy
[2:32:56] <axelkaspar> equally divided, much larger variance for DS
[2:33:03] <Thunderhog> Yeah cause pat'll take 5 years to say why he hates a thing
[2:33:04] <rosabellamelantha> DS is also really high quality even if you dislike it
[2:33:12] <rosabellamelantha> This however.....
[2:33:17] <rosabellamelantha> it LOOKS nice
[2:33:39] <fist_wizard_jay> @woolieversus Ypu excited to see if Baz is in the new King Knight story coming Dec 10th?
[2:33:45] <fist_wizard_jay> you*
[2:33:58] <+LucidProtean> Just got here, better make a good first impression. uh... Fuck Dhar?
[2:34:03] <@Solidus_113> do it
[2:34:20] <rosabellamelantha> Dhar did nothing wrong
[2:34:25] <rosabellamelantha> he caused less misery than ajna
[2:34:45] <KZN02> Carrying a bundle of sticks
[2:34:46] <DedlokPM> @fist_wizard_jay thing is, this was divisive for Pat and Woolie, but Death Stranding is something that ould definitely be up both of their allies. I would say that for most people, Death Stranding would be more divisive as it is more likely to be on people's radars than this.
[2:35:03] <prime_name> BEST BOY
[2:35:06] <@Solidus_113> PUPPER

[2:52:25] <Thunderhog> God damn woolie with the TODS
[2:52:27] <%toomuchsnarfsnarf> “ That’s what we like to call big damage “
[2:52:38] <@Solidus_113> remember that now you have your megaman dash
[2:52:44] <@Solidus_113> everything will be faster
[2:52:54] <+KawaiiJetty> Do mixup do combo do big number
[2:53:18] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus you can skip half the trek back up if you stick yo the outside
[2:53:19] <fist_wizard_jay> the goat told ya to fuck off Woolz
[2:54:32] <@Solidus_113> Arceus?
[2:54:55] <BreakersAweigh> wow he pronounced it correctly
[2:55:19] <BreakersAweigh> i was saying "ar-see-us" for YEARS
[2:56:39] <fist_wizard_jay> English is wierd
[2:56:54] <fist_wizard_jay> and its my main language
[2:57:15] <scoopyoopydoo> the tgc commercial always said PLATINUM AR-SEE-US tho
[2:57:16] <$MarvelousMaladroit> Long story short it was the inspiration for Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks
[2:57:25] <prime_name> Are you trying to say that Wu Tang ain't nothing to fuck with?
[2:57:31] <AMaidIndeed> is that why they got the Two Hands?
[2:57:52] <ManlyMcBeefington> map?
[2:58:20] <rosabellamelantha> Leilani is so good
[2:58:26] <rosabellamelantha> I literally never swapped her out
[2:58:28] <+steelmorrigan> You mean the man with te hiron fists right?
[2:58:41] <+steelmorrigan> Man with the iron MAsk is a Musketeers novel >.> <.<
[2:58:41] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:58:48] <Mendin> Oh hey Woolie got the airdash
[2:58:49] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> monkaS
[2:58:50] <+Ancopro> uHm
[2:58:51] <bevyrage> 0:
[2:58:54] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> HE WANTS DUFFS
[2:58:59] <Novillion> yo that looks badass
[2:59:05] <CharlesRobinJr> new to the indivisible stream how does combat work
[2:59:08] <rosabellamelantha> Double?
[2:59:23] <fist_wizard_jay> SATAN LOVES MAGIC
[2:59:25] <KZN02> Not hentai enough
[2:59:33] <+JacktheMan18> Who's the cutie with the chainsaw sword?
[2:59:35] <rosabellamelantha> He's weak as hell though
[2:59:41] <fist_wizard_jay> Or wait
[2:59:42] <@Solidus_113> You could probably do Razmi's down attack if nothing else
[2:59:44] <Mendin> Each character is a button, they get action points that fill up ATB style, each button can be neutral, up+button, or down+Button
[2:59:46] <rosabellamelantha> that's Leilani, an optional party member
[2:59:48] <fist_wizard_jay> is that Janemba?
[2:59:50] <@Solidus_113> SHIT
[2:59:50] <DedlokPM> HERE'S DA BIG WAN
[2:59:56] <Mendin> You got super meter shared, and you got combo bonuses
[3:00:07] <CMZ3> her down attack
[3:00:14] <KZN02> Her down attack heals the boss too
[3:00:24] <+JacktheMan18> @rosabellamelantha thanks
[3:00:30] <bevyrage> likely because you're too close to a wall
[3:00:37] <fist_wizard_jay> ANY magic heals this guy
[3:00:42] <DedlokPM> Leilani is such a cute
[3:00:47] <fist_wizard_jay> truth
[3:00:56] <@Solidus_113> I think your air dash is any direction
[3:01:02] <Mendin> Any further questions about the combat @CharlesRobinJr ?
[3:01:14] <UnfilteredComic> @Solidus_113 shhh, not yet it isnt
[3:01:15] <CatmanIX> @WoolieVersus razmi's down attack is a status curse, not a physical hit if that's what you're thinking
[3:01:24] <CMZ3> ^
[3:01:24] <CharlesRobinJr> nope thanks @Mendin
[3:01:25] <Mendin> It does a little damage, Catman
[3:01:36] <Mendin> Cheers
[3:01:38] <fuzz9369> I really need to get this game
[3:02:02] <Mendin> Take your time, fuzz, we're waiting on a content patch that'll add some stuff missing from several characters
[3:02:03] <MindlessMonks> Chesterr with the strats
[3:02:07] <Mendin> But do get it eventually
[3:02:22] <KZN02> Go right
[3:03:00] <+Ancopro> wait what's missing that they're adding
[3:03:01] <MindlessMonks> 4
[3:03:06] <MegaQuint> 4 was the hover
[3:03:10] <KZN02> You should probably switch Razmi to Ginseng and Honey in case you fight another magic absorbing enemy'
[3:03:49] <fist_wizard_jay> tbh for me Ginseng was a staple choice
[3:03:51] <Nested_Dreams> That was a sick one-round fight
[3:03:59] <Mendin> Leilani, Phoebe, and Yan all are missing supers, for one
[3:04:02] <prime_name> Tiger!
[3:04:11] <fist_wizard_jay> never swapped em out, except to try out Thorani for a smidge
[3:04:28] <spardanwarrior> Adding the guest characters, the backer characters, and the two characters from the standard roster who are still in the oven.
[3:04:30] <CMZ3> her grab into lvl 3 does more damage
[3:04:39] <Mendin> And Montreal Summer is construction mafia time
[3:04:45] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[3:05:30] <+Ancopro> oh yea i remember hearing about the guest characters, I thought i missed them
[3:05:38] <prime_name> It's been a second
[3:05:51] <fist_wizard_jay> I know the feeling Woolie, Chicago gets fucking plastered in snow sometimes
[3:05:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:06:03] <Tempmael> we live? nice
[3:06:21] <prime_name> Digging Woolie's keyboard
[3:06:25] <DedlokPM> also some characters are missing supers that they are going to add later
[3:06:42] <fist_wizard_jay> Not as much as Montreal, but enough that the city spends a shitload of money for plows and salt
[3:06:46] <+chesterr01> @mindlessmonks HeyGuys
[3:07:04] <MindlessMonks> @chesterr01 lol im dead

[3:10:47] <Mendin> "Furious Dumbass" is a phrase from K6BD that describes Ajna

[3:13:23] <Zayasu> WutFace
[3:13:23] <@Solidus_113> He plays League because they have better more consistent online, and he doesn't feel as bad when he loses because it's a team game

[3:15:47] <knyttstories> calebKek
[3:15:56] <Psyramics> at the end of the day, every moba plays out the same, even if the controls are different
[3:16:00] <DedlokPM> Mefense of Beh Ancients
[3:16:02] <MSN04_Sazabi> You wouldn't compain about a fighting game being bad on mouse & key and I played some that way LUL
