[0:06:11] <ashenjuan25> I’m sorry can someone explain the appeal of Swtor? Not trying to condescend I’m genuinely trying to find out if there’s some shit in there to check out.
[0:06:11] <%VCRUZZO> it waas not

[0:06:25] <GoldeNOVA> Atris is Jester
[0:06:34] <xBUBBA1995x> I had a dialogue boss battle with my D&D party last week. It was aginst the other players, and it made for an epic moment. I had to tell them off for being idiots and trying to kill themselves.
[0:06:36] <andrei11dr> Asuna is the was the Star Wars nerd GOAT ,Little V needs to retire
[0:06:36] <Matermind0> @ashenjuan25 Some of the class stories are pretty good

[0:08:32] <derap41> Korra is good but not better
[0:08:32] <%jinking79> last episode is just the greatest in Avatar
[0:08:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @fandomgod Why swing laser sword when you can do BIG HUNGRY?

[0:08:58] <ashenjuan25> Munchies > saber
[0:09:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> People who say Korra sucks haven't seen that part I s2g
[0:09:05] <tolloponik> wait he got to season 2?!
[0:09:13] <+Feralspirit41> Korra was alright
[0:09:20] <%DatAsuna> i don't like that part but it's visually nice
[0:09:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> It was so Ghibli
[0:09:34] <$Invlux> Nickelodeon, apologize for what you did to Korra
[0:09:45] <+SarcFa> The part is visually nice, but I personally don't like what it did to the world lore imho
[0:09:47] <tolloponik> @CanadianAnimatorGuy that ruined a bunch of lore though
[0:09:48] <ashenjuan25> Never saw Korra loved the OG series is it worth it?
[0:09:48] <%VCRUZZO> it is visually nice...that follow up though...
[0:09:50] <+Feralspirit41> Nickelodeon has alot to apologize for
[0:09:53] <%brachydios777> Korra feels like it should of ended at season 1
[0:09:55] <%MrMoonGoose> Korra was fucking great.
[0:10:01] <andrei11dr> A faithful Remake of this game would be just Kreygasm
[0:10:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> I binged Korra in the last 2 weeks. It was perfectly fine.
[0:10:11] <%Theycallmenerf> I’m not a fan of Korra.
[0:10:12] <+Feralspirit41> Korra wasnt avatar level but it was still alright
[0:10:22] <$StaceMcGate> should of cut Robot Planet too Kappa
[0:10:24] <andrei11dr> But it will never happen because EA
[0:10:27] <%krispen_wa> THAT PADAWAN
[0:10:27] <%MrMoonGoose> Korra was fucking great *especially after season one*
[0:10:30] <%DatAsuna> some stuff also just added continuity errors
[0:10:31] <time_axis> did we need padawan girl under Dantooine?
[0:10:32] <ashenjuan25> That’s a bummer but if it’s ok I really don’t get the hate
[0:10:32] <%vextalyst> LOVE KORRA except season 2
[0:10:34] <werunos> hey, I can't stick around to watch things live due to it being like 3 AM here but I was wondering, have you ever had any discussions about how like the entire cast is informed by trauma even outside the Interesting Force Philosophy stuff? I'd be super interested in heraing what you guys think about that
[0:10:38] <+Feralspirit41> Oh god that padawan on dantooine
[0:10:41] <huskarl_zap> My restored content mod isn't capable of being finished because a model is missing and it crashes when the enemy attacks me. Might happen to you aswell.
[0:10:42] <surik_at> Genoharadan is just plain sad
[0:10:46] <shutupandjam3465> droid planet was deliberatly taken out. They didnt like what they had done and wanted to wipe it
[0:11:03] <Halospaz117> Where's my wipes!
[0:11:04] <Doodle_Taco> I personally really dislike Korra but I can see why people like it
[0:11:05] <GoldeNOVA> Hard to do in the engine maybe

[0:12:21] <+mars_driver> If Woolie does end up playing Mass Effect, no matter what path his character takes, I hope he decks that reporter right in the jaw.
[0:12:25] <HeavyNorse> Oh yes, play all the Mass Effect games! Would be awesome!
[0:12:32] <%Ghostbody> lol
[0:12:36] <%Theycallmenerf> @mars_driver same
[0:12:40] <+Feralspirit41> I forgot about the reporter in mass effect
[0:12:41] <ashenjuan25> Mass effect one is still a gem
[0:12:43] <%jillpilled> Mass Effect with you two would be amazing
[0:12:45] <+Feralspirit41> always punch the reporter
[0:12:46] <%catmam116> awesome playthrough guys. Cant wait to see how it ends!
[0:12:48] <petwisk> the Power of Corruption
[0:12:51] <andrei11dr> For being like 70 ,Kreia is holding all right
[0:12:51] <ashenjuan25> Mira sucks ass still
[0:13:14] <+mars_driver> It's the ONLY renegade option I take, even on full Paragon playthroughs. Just to make her the one person in the galaxy that hates me, while everyone else loves me.
[0:13:27] <andrei11dr> But you know Shit never shave
[0:13:29] <%brachydios777> @mrmoongoose I get that, but it kinda feels like the stakes lower a bit with a new world changing threat every other month
[0:13:30] <shutupandjam3465> literally didnt know how to live without the force but yeah its prety open for interpretation
[0:13:49] <%VCRUZZO> mmm
[0:14:09] <derap41> Man MK 11 is so good
[0:14:10] <memejima> "Your force is MINE"
[0:14:18] <huskarl_zap> force vampires
[0:14:27] <%Javaa01> Dark Side is spirit bomb charging from DBZ:Abridged
[0:14:33] <stealthfart> Mass Effect 1 had that space opera feel, that the sequels lost. BioWare games in a series kept getting worse the longer they went on and if not worse then they lost something that made it work in the first game.
[0:14:36] <%SmoothEnigma> her planet was all force sensitives though
[0:14:37] <petwisk> Force Genki Dama
[0:14:46] <MyNameIsRasus> many many wounds
[0:15:01] <ashenjuan25> Mass effect 2 still has some great character writing tho
[0:15:02] <+cowardman93> 1 person survived, BIG SUSPICION
[0:15:03] <%brachydios777> @stealthfart Bioware in general
[0:15:03] <%DatAsuna> Synthesis
[0:15:06] <%VCRUZZO> @SmoothEnigma so it was super fucked then
[0:15:17] <+Feralspirit41> Mass effect two was super linear compared to one
[0:15:20] <ashenjuan25> And even though mass effect 3 fumbled a lot there was still some greatly written moments
[0:15:24] <zeow31> her whole specie relied on the force
[0:15:25] <$jake5713> Darth Wools and Master V! Can't watch the stream atm. Just wanted to say thanks for making Wednesday's something to look forward to. You guys are one of the only good parts of this quarantine and I've been getting back into Star Wars. Between the end of Clone Wars, The Mandalorian and you guys, remembering why I love the franchise in the first place.

[0:17:17] <%SmoothEnigma> @invlux I believe in some cut content offscreen he jumps into a reactor somewhere to shut down another droid Factory offscreen and that kills him? could be wrong but that's what I remember from looking into it way back so dont take it as gospel

[0:18:42] <@Commando_Joe> Raccoon based economy
[0:18:46] <xBUBBA1995x> My craving for dialogue boss battles is driving me mad.
[0:18:57] <+Feralspirit41> My families had more outback lately, we hadnt gone to the restaurant nearby in years because the service was so garbage
[0:19:00] <%OldManJEWc> Diet and exercise y'all

[0:19:02] <+cowardman93> I'm only ordering from local places instead of the big chains
[0:19:05] <GHouseduivel> Cutting sugar is a bitch
[0:19:07] <+charmquarke> I work at a GameStop, so we're still open, and I just order food from the pizza place next door
[0:19:10] <%DemonOfSalt> Keto Diet V is the hero we don't deserve but we need in these times.
[0:19:10] <andrei11dr> Actually got i got my Cthulu lore wrong ,Nihilus is definitely Yug-Siturath
[0:19:12] <derap41> Then it taste fucking terrible
[0:19:15] <ashenjuan25> Saren is a great version of the dialogue boss battle

[0:20:42] <ashenjuan25> Universe
[0:20:43] <xBUBBA1995x> The concept of top-down works for many things. KOTOR, cleaning window blinds, learning your car, and gazing at women.
[0:20:44] <%Ghostbody> @vextalyst that's why it's called "Going up the Gary Glitter"
[0:20:44] <derap41> Its a very safe game
[0:20:44] <ashenjuan25> Chill
[0:20:52] <shutupandjam3465> what game? fallen order?
[0:20:57] <%brachydios777> It’s sekiro souls wars
[0:20:57] <Halospaz117> To be fair, what competition does it have in the last decade?
[0:20:59] <GHouseduivel> It's the closest thing to Jedi Academy
[0:21:00] <available_line> Isn't it just SW dark souls?
[0:21:01] <+cowardman93> there hasn't been many Star Wars games in the past decade
[0:21:03] <%DatAsuna> So it's that and BF2/TFO? lol
[0:21:19] <KnightofNights2> There's some easter eggs that you won't get unless you're caught up with the CGI series.
[0:21:19] <%vaporousTippler> Best game since Jedi Academy.
[0:21:20] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[0:21:22] <+mars_driver> Maaaan, that new Squadrons game is gonna be loaded with lootboxes, and all I want is another round with my Rogue Boys.
[0:21:22] <ashenjuan25> Last Jedi’s poise system makes animations for bosses kind of lie to you

[0:23:08] <%brachydios777> WOW shocked
[0:23:08] <time_axis> Overpriced DLC is why I dropped Dragon Age Inquisition.
[0:23:10] <%alrobot2014> its been a goddamn decade since those games released
[0:23:12] <ashenjuan25> I’m not holding my breath for squadrons given the leaks kinda paint a Dire picture
[0:23:14] <ShiningAxis> Almost all the DLC is crap anyway
[0:23:15] <+Feralspirit41> You mean EA forced you to go through some bullshit designed to make a ton of money for things that arent worth the price they wanted? Noooooooooo not EA
[0:23:22] <Halospaz117> I don't think 1 was even on PS3
[0:23:24] <andrei11dr> Boy, im sure happy EA might purchase NRS ,why would you not be Kappa
[0:23:24] <%Irridium> It is BC with Xbone
[0:23:31] <%brachydios777> Black ops 2 is still $60
[0:23:31] <%DatAsuna> It came to PS3 years later

[0:23:38] <ralphfromdk> Looks kinda meh, it's 360 graphics, and runs kinda ass even by console standards
[0:23:41] <JetpackMcQuack> DLC is actually good, very short though for that price.

[0:27:05] <sANfouR44> I'm ready to feel vindicated when it will turn out they really got the worst ending because of HK factory. And i'm ready to eat my words if they won't.
[0:27:07] <ashenjuan25> Where is Mahvel?
[0:27:16] <leomuratore> LUL
[0:27:16] <%krispen_wa> they won't get the worst ending

[0:27:43] <liljojofett> If Squadrons isn't Ace Combat in space, I will be disappointed
[0:27:43] <%VCRUZZO> that is an improvement from the ones I remember last time I went
[0:27:43] <ashenjuan25> Finn should have been the fucking Jedi
[0:27:44] <huskarl_zap> NO, Kill the past.
[0:27:47] <endarren> They should just call it the Skywalker Lightsaber
[0:27:51] <JetpackMcQuack> They obviously named that before ep 9
[0:27:54] <andrei11dr> Anakin, ho that? Kappa
[0:28:00] <+cowardman93> @brachydios777 HOTAS full flight stick, it's nuts they're supporting stuff. Makes me more and more hopeful
[0:28:00] <Huntercd> why didn't Finn get one?
[0:28:02] <memejima> Slap a green gummy bear in that shit
[0:28:04] <AnneSQF> wouldn't Rey's be the yellow one from the end of RoS?
[0:28:06] <%VCRUZZO> @endarren thats spot on my dude
[0:28:09] <huskarl_zap> WRONG THE PAST IS KILL

[0:28:10] <+09havocworm> cool
[0:28:11] <%brachydios777> I blame paul marketing for that
[0:28:16] <%DatAsuna> ultrasabers too
[0:28:17] <%vextalyst> Hey V would u reccomend Kyber Brand?
[0:28:23] <SereneFox> House of mouse says fuck your canon.

[0:28:26] <%brachydios777> @cowardman93 Crossing fingers
[0:28:27] <+funnyfunnykid> Expensive stick
[0:28:32] <time_axis> I will never be okay with those lightsabers until they figure out how to do it without the big goofy plastic part.
[0:28:33] <surik_at> sure it's not crimson or smth, V& Kappa
[0:28:34] <%krispen_wa> So did Luke go from Guardian->Master?

[0:29:03] <+Deano8817> Influence lost: Kreia
[0:29:07] <andrei11dr> That's gilf quality right there
[0:29:07] <%ACrystalSage> Betrayal
[0:29:09] <ashenjuan25> Finn should have been protag tbh it’s a similar but different set up for Luke too given Luke’s arc and how Luke rejected the dark of his lineage
[0:29:09] <%Ace_Clef> V listens to Tyler the Creator CONFIRMED
[0:29:11] <$JonnyCue> Holy lordy that starkiller saber on Vader's Vault is $2,600???

[0:29:41] <%brachydios777> @ashenjuan25 Should have been a equal character with Rey
[0:29:42] <%Lightwolfe> And guess what happens if you go dark side?
[0:29:43] <available_line> It is such a quiet thing to change the main menu.
[0:29:43] <%VCRUZZO> @DatAsuna damn I forgot about that entirely
[0:29:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MALACHOR V: BECOME CRUST

[0:30:48] <%lotharrio> The Dark Souls of KotOR 2
[0:30:51] <+greatgetter> Don't you have nearly 200 saves?
[0:30:51] <SereneFox> The game has fallen to the grasp of the dark side.
[0:30:54] <blackskulldragon18> she has turned heel
[0:30:55] <+logoth_> Boooourns
[0:30:55] <werunos> LUL

[0:31:33] <+maenos2> yes
[0:31:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Atris sith name was Darth Karen
[0:31:36] <$NoWayRyanTatum> Lightside Sith storylines are SO GOOD
[0:31:39] <+09havocworm> I love SWTOR
[0:31:44] <time_axis> non-crazy sith
[0:31:49] <Mayachacha> 800+ viewers damn
[0:31:56] <+maenos2> lightside sith is SO FUN
[0:31:57] <available_line> Darth Antihero?
[0:31:58] <$NoWayRyanTatum> They legit try to destroy the empire from within
[0:32:01] <ashenjuan25> Be-Treia-al
[0:32:05] <+kapcommunist> i came for the finale!
[0:32:07] <+serpenttucker> So lawful evil where as pure sith is chaotic evil
[0:32:07] <Halospaz117> Yeah like, you're still a sith, but you're not a fucking psycho
[0:32:13] <Knight972> Lightside sith warrior is SO good
[0:32:21] <+09havocworm> I always play a light side Sith
[0:32:26] <%lotharrio> "I'm not angry. I'm disappointed."
[0:32:27] <+Aldesso> imperial Agent is the best Star wars Story i ever played
[0:32:30] <huskarl_zap> Sith warrior doing more Inquisiting than the Inquisitor.
[0:32:32] <%HiTierLyla> lighside sith is also not racist lol
[0:32:33] <+Feralspirit41> I still prefer the bounty hunter
[0:32:34] <Halospaz117> There are still some straight up good options tho
[0:32:45] <+kapcommunist> i was anime but fuck it, i wanna be here for the finale
[0:32:49] <%chaoticknuckles0> Join the dark sides we have cookies
[0:32:50] <time_axis> seems like a crash
[0:32:55] <%lotharrio> But we need to make it OBVIOUS!
[0:32:55] <+RowenCleric> is swtor free now or still subscription?
[0:32:59] <andrei11dr> RIP the game
[0:33:01] <+wunp_fxs> Voice acting adds a lot but takes away loads of choices
[0:33:01] <Halospaz117> @Feralspirit41 Female Bounty Hunter gets to be voiced by Azula and fuck a Johnny Yong Bosch Mandalorian, how can you not live it?
[0:33:02] <%mitchteck> Agent is so good
[0:33:02] <time_axis> oh
[0:33:03] <%alrobot2014> PogChamp
[0:33:03] <$Invlux> uhoh that computer thinkin

[0:33:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @gigas_trains But the Jedis have Pozza
[0:33:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> pizza
[0:33:13] <SereneFox> He does have like all the saves in the world, so it takes a while it seems.
[0:33:17] <+toastybites> yeah honestly
[0:33:17] <+greatgetter> Fallout 4 with its 4 options
[0:33:18] <ashenjuan25> A light side sith warrior sounds like a cool concept but like actually showing how the sith code could do good
[0:33:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> pozza
[0:33:21] <+DakotaMacDoodle> god damn fallout 4
[0:33:25] <memejima> Either make it linear or DONT make it look like theres a choice
[0:33:26] <+Feralspirit41> @halospaz117 wait azula does the female hunter?
[0:33:26] <%brachydios777> Fallout 4
[0:33:31] <+Aldesso> imperial Agent ist just a great James bond game
[0:33:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:33:33] <%vaporousTippler> SWTOR is free, but you have to pay to hide your helmet. So yeah.
[0:33:34] <Halospaz117> @Feralspirit41 yup
[0:33:36] <%alrobot2014> is there in game sound?
[0:33:36] <RantingRavager> question: is there supposed to be music?
[0:33:38] <$Invlux> ooh there's a battle going on outside
[0:33:40] <KiddKame> No Game Audio?
[0:33:42] <available_line> HOW IS THE SHIP NOT FALLING APART?

[0:33:47] <GHouseduivel> half-dead
[0:33:48] <time_axis> is there supposed to be game audio here? Maybe its just quiet
[0:33:50] <%lotharrio> Fallout 4 is the worst at that. Your options are: "Yes, Yes but I'm funny, Yes but I'm angry, tell more more but Yes."
[0:33:50] <%crumpetninja> No audio
