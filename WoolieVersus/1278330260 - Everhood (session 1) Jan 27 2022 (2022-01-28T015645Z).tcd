[1:02:18] <%dds333a> @arqartur0 I KILLED PAUL ALLEN
[1:02:18] <%Charronia> First enemy is a haunted ATM, this is gonna be good esaGood
[1:02:19] <Champstice> Yeah kinda hard to appreciate the visuals when actually playing the game LMAO
[1:02:25] <+Hollow_Mirage> I see that the strat for the game is “woolie the coward”
[1:02:27] <dukenux> what could that mean?
[1:02:33] <+samuraiknack> Woolie laming it out
[1:02:35] <%Deekman> i don't understand the difficulty when you don't need to move with the beat or anything
[1:02:39] <dukenux> u_o
[1:02:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> It's the Cuphead Paradox, animations so pretty but no time to look and admire them
[1:02:50] <Rafoki> ";P DIE" sounds like my usual ATM
[1:02:59] <DSD24> Na this is pretty nice actually
[1:03:02] <%ozzrabbit> … is Woolie playing on “Normal” mode, or “Hard” mode like a crazy person?
[1:03:05] <%espanishcanamurciana> What is this lol
[1:03:07] <rasamune> @deekman you’ll see
[1:03:08] <HotSauceFiend> the difficulty is your health
[1:03:11] <DSD24> @ozzrabbit Hard
[1:03:12] <verscoll> @ozzrabbit Hard
[1:03:13] <Champstice> @Ricky_Rexx honestly that's a pretty apt comparison too, yeah
[1:03:16] <greatspaceadventure> Failed soundcloud rapper battle
[1:03:20] <+Synthose_> Hard, but not impossible
[1:03:21] <%dds333a> nice
[1:03:23] <HotSauceFiend> the higher difficulty the lowrt your health bar is
[1:03:24] <leith_aziz> Capitalism. The hardest of fights
[1:03:25] <DXLelouch24> oh god he has Flowey face
[1:03:25] <%espanishcanamurciana> Hahaha
[1:03:27] <jimgimp> "This machine just called me an asshole!"
[1:03:30] <%SainEdge> i have no sense of rythm, so this would be hell for me LUL
[1:03:40] <dukenux> can i withraw in Kromer? \
[1:03:47] <+Byr0nX> bison dolla?
[1:03:49] <+theoldone001> I like the game but I feel like you're fighting against the beat than along with it
[1:03:51] <greatspaceadventure> Mmmmy boobies cost me 20 schmuckles!
[1:03:51] <JonnyZeFox> it's weird that the enemy is playing a rhythm game but you're not
[1:04:00] <PKSomething> LUL
[1:04:02] <+NeonFishFace> fuck you, says the atm
[1:04:03] <+horsesaredumb> @SainEdge you dont play to the rhythm in this game
[1:04:04] <jayunderscorez> @SainEdge It's less of a rhythm game than platforming to the music lol
[1:04:22] <BreakfastSampler> yeah it's like you're fighting a beatmania stage, not playing it
[1:04:25] <%dds333a> nice LUL
[1:04:27] <+Maxo_Stream> @SainEdge I actually have a pretty good sense of rhythm but the jumping and movement isnt necessarily tied to it, which is extra frustrating
[1:04:28] <jimgimp> Subverted ryhtm game
[1:04:29] <Arqartur0> @NeonFishFace which is polite for an ATM
[1:04:31] <jimgimp> *ryhtm

[1:04:38] <dukenux> no?

[1:04:40] <+horsesaredumb> no fight skipped
[1:04:41] <DSD24> Oh man are we already getting club music?
[1:04:41] <+Hollow_Mirage> Yep
[1:04:49] <DSD24> Unce Unce
[1:04:51] <greatspaceadventure> it's the same principle that Undertale uses TOuhou's gameplay for
[1:04:51] <+HereComestheChief> lytJIVE
[1:04:55] <%Indigo_Automaton> You didn't miss a fight with him, no
[1:04:56] <greatspaceadventure> but instead of that it's a rhythm game
[1:04:56] <Champstice> Yeah no fight skipped, just "hey get schmuckle to enter club"
[1:04:57] <rasamune> It’s fine who cares
[1:05:01] <slimey0> it's like audiosurf

[1:36:58] <leith_aziz> I cant be part of cohhHmm
[1:36:59] <%Shad0wTag> Absolute Church of Truth time??
[1:37:00] <%dds333a> @jaxnos LUL LUL indeed
[1:37:05] <DudeDern> an smt rhythm game would be cool
[1:37:10] <%Lion_kun> Equivalent Exchange
[1:37:11] <%Juriasu> did Woolie create this game
[1:37:12] <Aussie_Manny> Seven seconds, Cloud...
[1:37:24] <%dds333a> back here
[1:37:30] <leith_aziz> Rebirth x2?
[1:37:32] <kingra> This game is great but I hate the ending (or atleast the true ending)
[1:37:32] <+AceNugget> Yo when do we go after the people who got Absolute Truth No. 3?
[1:37:37] <Aussie_Manny> Red Geno has arisen!
[1:37:38] <+Synthose_> Welcome back. You're a mess.
[1:37:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:37:41] <$tkuwari> LUL
[1:37:42] <%Renzaku69> Death is pain
[1:37:42] <zzNamttamzz> The broken grates csbeastSetIn
[1:37:45] <jimgimp> Everyone goes to heaven, my favorite real life ending
[1:37:48] <%Indigo_Automaton> Shit's fucked
[1:37:51] <leith_aziz> This game's got balls. Gotta give it that
[1:37:51] <+ArdentGamerIC> After we get the secret Absolute Truth
[1:37:54] <%Charronia> Went to heaven and God tells you you're too early
[1:37:54] <greatspaceadventure> trust, it was NOT more complicated
[1:37:56] <+casy_fair> had to figure back from hell
[1:37:56] <%dds333a> Donnie darko also dealt with mortality, and I rewatched it recently, what a coincidence
[1:37:56] <%CisealNine> I was expecting the Absolute Truth to be something like "a banana is a banana."
[1:37:57] <leith_aziz> pickyDerp
[1:38:07] <kulmoth> @jimgimp yeah but that person you hate is there too
[1:38:08] <a_mad_dragon_> is it though SoonerLater
[1:38:14] <greatspaceadventure> trying to do the metal boss fight without dying is close to impossible lol
[1:38:17] <Jaxnos> ok, video game. ok.
[1:38:19] <Darmanimon> this is the morning after going to the club where you wake up next to a dumpster covered in your own saliva
[1:38:33] <%Renzaku69> oh shit what happened? 0w 0
[1:38:39] <jimgimp> @kulmoth Nah man I learned a while ago that love is the way
[1:38:40] <Aussie_Manny> Another gnome?
[1:38:45] <Jaxnos> what is that lost soul ish over there
[1:38:46] <+projectmanatees> i'd say more earthbound
[1:38:49] <%Renzaku69> people are ash piles yo
[1:38:50] <Darmanimon> show him gnome mercy
[1:38:55] <+projectmanatees> like the coffee segments
[1:38:55] <kulmoth> @jimgimp oh yeah the thing you like SUCKS
[1:38:58] <+ArdentGamerIC> Poor blue
[1:39:00] <%dds333a> welp
[1:39:02] <dukenux> How about i slap YOUR shit
[1:39:09] <%dds333a> not entirely LUL
[1:39:14] <dukenux> THEY TOOK MY SHINS
[1:39:16] <+toastybites> just steal his arms LUL
[1:39:20] <jimgimp> @kulmoth Like literally loving your enemies to death is endgame to me now
[1:39:20] <$tkuwari> aw :(
[1:39:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> fuck him
[1:39:23] <Champstice> Gonna be real for a second: It will be mighty disappointing if the yt upload doesn't include "molly water" anywhere in the title(s)
[1:39:24] <+Synthose_> So Red Mage, Blue Thief, Gold Pig, Purple mage
[1:39:27] <+Fefe41> Grapple away
[1:39:27] <Aussie_Manny> This ISN'T a Toby Fox game... I guess this is gonna be a trending style choice then.
[1:39:28] <leith_aziz> Why not pickyProud
[1:39:28] <FrostedZaibatsu> Become ONE
[1:39:31] <Shwepie> @projectmanatees To be fair, Undertale is just Earthbound in disguise.
[1:39:37] <+Synthose_> Are we playing Gauntlet Legend?
[1:39:44] <+capybruhArt> Problem Hero
[1:39:45] <Jaxnos> gather the super sentai
[1:39:49] <leith_aziz> We've become an Aniki
[1:39:50] <%dds333a> form up like voltron
[1:39:51] <%CisealNine> I would just take his arm.
[1:39:54] <+projectmanatees> @Shwepie thats an absolute turth
[1:39:58] <JonnyZeFox> LUL
[1:40:00] <Tisaric> They wear the Undertale inspiration on their chest but this game has it's own quirks
[1:40:01] <Champstice> @Shwepie So are Yume Nikki and Lisa to a degree lol
[1:40:11] <+Synthose_> Blue Thief is about to die. Blue thief needs food, badly!
[1:40:15] <DSD24> Lets hope Lancer doesn't die
[1:40:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> was expecting a part member, got a item
[1:40:20] <%Shad0wTag> GATTAI
[1:40:21] <Aussie_Manny> You already tookie a cookie!
[1:40:22] <+choopercabra> I'm beginning to think no one has actually played Earthbound.
[1:40:28] <%dds333a> he's like Juliet's boyfriend in Lollipop Chainsaw
[1:40:31] <Tisaric> no woolie
[1:40:33] <Jnkolm> same chooper
[1:40:35] <+projectmanatees> @Champstice i hope woolie shows reggie lisa that'd be a fun stream
[1:40:36] <Speckster42> every post-snes rpg is earthbound
[1:40:43] <%dds333a> or Grimoire Weiss
[1:40:50] <Darmanimon> or Momir
[1:40:53] <AntiGulp> The question is, will it throw you into a boss fight every time you die?
[1:40:55] <JonnyZeFox> is this earthbound? 🦋
[1:40:57] <Champstice> @projectmanatees Eh, the SBFP reference might make it a smidge awkward ig
[1:40:57] <FrostedZaibatsu> That shouldve happen on like the 5th death or something..
[1:40:58] <dukenux> 90% of people who played Undertale didn't play EB, and that's an optimistic estimate
[1:41:00] <HotSauceFiend> sure woolie you "won"
[1:41:03] <leith_aziz> Hi, Door-kun
[1:41:13] <+Hollow_Mirage> I never ever want to see that sequence again my eyes were tearing up
[1:41:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn Grey Door Quit Hatin
[1:41:35] <%dds333a> @darmanimon mimir, too
[1:41:37] <%townzzzzz> da no arm man
[1:41:39] <%dds333a> like you said
[1:42:07] <dukenux> Punishe Puppet
[1:42:10] <+Synthose_> I'm pretty sure the Incinerator fight just goes on, and gets harder until you lose. I don't think you can "Win" it.
[1:42:18] <dukenux> holy Yume Nikki
[1:42:20] <AntiGulp> Ok THIS room is Yume Nikki.
[1:42:22] <a_mad_dragon_> yume nikki hub world
[1:42:28] <Ramasama13> run it back?
[1:42:34] <Darmanimon> oh you're playing on Hard? No wonder
[1:42:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> Dream save rotation
[1:42:38] <+ArdentGamerIC> You CAN win the incinerator, it's just asinine
[1:42:39] <Tisaric> oh no the QA brain is in action
[1:42:45] <Champstice> Wow just like underbound amirite

[1:43:11] <%dds333a> LET'S GO
[1:43:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> Is the incinerator like the first Urizen fight in DMC5? You can beat it but you're kind of not meant to?
[1:43:17] <dukenux> plus those lanterns..\
[1:43:19] <%Renzaku69> Woolie's Iron Will is freaking calling out
[1:43:22] <+ArdentGamerIC> If you need to know, just watch a video of the no hit incinerator

[1:45:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WOW
[1:45:14] <+Synthose_> Its a real fight
[1:45:16] <Tisaric> it's not something you're meant to do
[1:45:21] <Bonebagmel> Is this doable?
[1:45:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> "have you tried not getting hit?"
[1:45:24] <leith_aziz> Interestingly, Raven was present in some of the art, but he wasn't playable untill Xrd. taht's because they couldnt figure out the technology that could animate his limbs untill then cohhNotes
[1:45:24] <defaultname3887> wait we retrying the incinerator?
[1:45:25] <SaintBeau> it's a 0.1% achievement
[1:45:25] <Tisaric> it's doable
[1:45:29] <+Celarious> It's the hardest cheevo in the game
[1:45:31] <defaultname3887> man got here just in time
[1:45:32] <$tkuwari> The incinerator is impossible for a reason
[1:45:33] <Tisaric> but it's not something you're supposed to do
[1:45:33] <DudeDern> you gotta take notes for this
[1:45:34] <%riffsofdylheim> it impossible
[1:45:34] <Pookiedaexzile> No Beat Drop for you
[1:45:35] <leith_aziz> He was a boss in Overture though
[1:45:35] <+ArdentGamerIC> You could do it, but don't
[1:45:36] <dukenux> vargMRKILL
[1:45:37] <+Synthose_> You gotta earn that beat
[1:45:39] <+Ricky_Rexx> You gotta EARN that drop woolie
[1:45:40] <EVOriginal> Let it drop Woolie. That's your responsibility. lol
[1:45:41] <xUrbanCarnage> Welcome to the incinerator
[1:45:43] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz he also used to look WAY different LUL
[1:45:44] <Aussie_Manny> Nah, you have to EARN the drop.
[1:45:46] <%brisk_dacat> Wow that’s ruff
[1:45:48] <SaintBeau> not impossible, nearly impossible tho
[1:45:53] <Pookiedaexzile> No Beat Drop till you take out BPeppa Pig

[1:46:00] <xUrbanCarnage> We guarantee a warm welcome
[1:46:05] <Bonebagmel> yeah that's a "take notes on each death"
[1:46:06] <+Mr_Pylon> Gotta earn that drop
[1:46:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Like the DMC5 reviewers who complained the music wasn't good when it's based on skill
[1:46:10] <%Lion_kun> YOU GOTTA EARN THAT BEAT
[1:46:14] <ChoculaUltra> in-battle jumps ONLY
[1:46:17] <GHouseduivel> THRASH
[1:46:24] <Bonebagmel> @Ricky_Rexx Holy crap I didn't know about this
[1:46:28] <leith_aziz> @dds333a You mean before Overture? Yeah, he had a blind eye I remember. I think his Overture getup is the coolest pickyEZ
[1:46:33] <HotSauceFiend> so beating this is competely optional and completing requires HOURS of learning patterns

[1:48:48] <leith_aziz> Dont blame you for that one
[1:48:49] <Champstice> FlRST TRY
[1:48:49] <@Solidus_113> it's the final boss of helltaker
[1:48:53] <%Renzaku69> Woolies need to take the path of most resistance is always something that will baffle me, truly a will of iron.
[1:48:55] <Darmanimon> maybe a couple hours'
[1:48:55] <+Fetrigon> look with yo ears majinoSkiip
[1:49:01] <%brisk_dacat> Alt or die
[1:49:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Renzaku69 Man was a game tester, it's in his training
[1:49:15] <%dds333a> Is this gonna be like beating Vanguard, and the guy dies anyway?
[1:49:18] <%Juriasu> he already is the hero
[1:49:21] <+Fetrigon> @renzaku69 LUL
[1:49:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BUT WHAT IF THO
[1:49:28] <+BigBruthaThunda> God-King Reg
[1:49:29] <%dds333a> woolieKICKDAD is the Hero
[1:49:32] <Tisaric> Oh there's a part 2 to the incinerator as well
[1:49:34] <Champstice> @dds333a Mayhaps
[1:49:34] <+Ricky_Rexx> but if you do it it'll be SOOOOO COOL
[1:49:38] <SomeOtherNeb> this game would rule at AGDQ
[1:49:52] <Champstice> @SomeOtherNeb Yo haven't even thought about that
[1:49:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:49:53] <GoblinPinkWizard> ^^^
[1:49:57] <Tisaric> It's not a rhythm game Woolie
[1:49:59] <%Renzaku69> Super Beast Woolie and Regi are on it
[1:50:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> sheeeeeesh
[1:50:10] <Jaxnos> LUL

[1:50:22] <+Fetrigon> LUL
[1:50:28] <%Juriasu> it's audiosurf basically
[1:50:29] <Tisaric> but it's off beat
[1:50:30] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[1:50:33] <Aussie_Manny> Everhood: Bitch You Thought Edition.
[1:50:34] <LunarRemix> It's not as tight as you're making it to be.
[1:50:37] <Champstice> It's bullet-hell, in the form of a rhythm game
[1:50:41] <%dds333a> it is basically Audiosurf
[1:50:43] <+Ricky_Rexx> Have you tried just feeling it in your heart?
[1:50:44] <GoblinPinkWizard> it's a rhythem
[1:50:44] <SomeOtherNeb> the rhythm is useful to recognise the patterns, but they're not 1-to-1
[1:50:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Mosher of the Deathmetal Valley
[1:50:56] <GoblinPinkWizard> it's a rhythm-asterisk game
[1:50:57] <LunarRemix> In Crypt you have to do action on the beat. On this game it's whatever as long as you don't get hit
[1:50:58] <Deimos002> You're the guitar solo as the rhythm plays
[1:51:01] <dukenux> it's rhytm game - the rhytm is the enemy
[1:51:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, the fact that rhythm is half utilized but half not would mess me the HELL up
[1:51:02] <Darmanimon> it's a rhythm-like LUL
[1:51:08] <%Juriasu> SourPls

[1:54:59] <Aussie_Manny> There's no jump, right?
[1:55:00] <HotSauceFiend> you have to dash a bunch
[1:55:03] <+Ricky_Rexx> Do you need to keep moving non stop?
[1:55:06] <Darmanimon> @Aussie_Manny correct
[1:55:14] <+mace210> YEP
[1:55:32] <+mace210> tap tap tap tap tap taap
[1:55:33] <HotSauceFiend> @ricky_rexx you dont have to move All the time. there are points where stating still helps.
[1:55:39] <+Kitrane> 1357986421357 pattern. not too hard
[1:55:47] <HotSauceFiend> but mostly running around
[1:56:02] <HotSauceFiend> memorizing the pattern here is gonna take hours
[1:56:03] <Darmanimon> Clone Hero is what it's all about nowadays
[1:56:30] <%Renzaku69> damn i miss my dreads, head banging isnt the same
[1:56:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Toki Wartooth is Not a Bumblebee
[1:56:39] <HotSauceFiend> woolie double tap to run
[1:56:47] <Darmanimon> he knows
[1:57:08] <Champstice> @HotSauceFiend Doesn't help its a surprisingly long sequence
[1:57:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:57:08] <%riffsofdylheim> stop he's already deaaad
[1:57:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> if Toki Wartooth was here he would have beaten it already

[1:57:30] <%dds333a> the absolute bullshit
[1:57:33] <+Lionkevinson> Too hard
[1:57:46] <HotSauceFiend> @champstice yeah woolie and teggie are underestimating how long this fight is
[1:57:53] <HotSauceFiend> reggie*
[1:58:02] <Darmanimon> 2020Shred 2020Shred 2020Shred 2020Shred 2020Shred
[1:58:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> @HotSauceFiend if 5 minutes a good guess?
[1:58:21] <+Kitrane> is woolie waiting to move until the highlighted panels hit him?
[1:58:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Stop reacting and just think
[1:58:24] <+MeyB_7> these patterns are crazy
[1:58:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> Maybe just keep walking
[1:58:33] <Darmanimon> @Pookiedaexzile stop thinking and just react
[1:58:41] <+Lionkevinson> Big give up
[1:58:43] <%Giothegame> Did the guys warn about flashing lights and what not with this game?
[1:58:45] <HotSauceFiend> @ricky_rexx the full fight lasts for 10minutes. and gets much much harder
[1:58:49] <+Lionkevinson> Guys it’s okay
[1:58:51] <Champstice> @HotSauceFiend yeah
[1:58:57] <Darmanimon> @Giothegame yeah the start of the game has a warning about it
[1:59:06] <%Giothegame> Ok cool
[1:59:11] <%ozzrabbit> Well, again, they could just swallow their pride and turn down the difficulty… but these two can be as stubborn as mules at times.
[1:59:14] <%Lion_kun> How about we just watch it on YouTube?
[1:59:18] <+AceNugget> close ur eyes and feel the beat :)
[1:59:31] <SomeOtherNeb> @ozzrabbit this bit is just as hard on normal, I believe
[1:59:34] <%dds333a> @ozzrabbit I dont feek,this is tied to difficulty
[1:59:34] <%Renzaku69> @ozzrabbit you realize thats like expecting pigs to fly right?
[1:59:35] <Champstice> @ozzrabbit I don't think the difficulty changing helps much with this particular fight
[1:59:42] <+thesw1tch> lol hes dying on beat
[1:59:43] <Gelphaze> Its time to BURN!
[1:59:50] <+horsesaredumb> there's an achievement to do this without getting hit

[2:00:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> Can you call LittleV? He might be good at this
[2:00:03] <+Mr_Pylon> it's real tough
[2:00:04] <Champstice> @horsesaredumb oh that's sadistic
[2:00:10] <Darmanimon> this section seems like it would be the only thing not toned down by lowering the difficulty
[2:00:13] <%dds333a> @ricky_rexx LUL LUL
[2:00:17] <+Mr_Pylon> this section is for real
[2:00:31] <Zeneeba> @HotSauceFiend I listen to it while i play other games like Unite or Isaac. :D
[2:00:34] <Blank9> Dancing dangerously in the middle
[2:00:35] <SomeOtherNeb> if you manage to beat this first try you deserve an award LUL
[2:00:38] <HotSauceFiend> remember. the difficulty is only to increase or decrease your health and regen
[2:00:49] <%dds333a> I tend to coniseer my self an "extreme minority" Kappa
[2:01:02] <Champstice> @HotSauceFiend Doesn't it affect patterns with Some fights?

[2:02:44] <+Kitrane> though I guess this game grabbing them like this might be good news for a continued playthrough
[2:02:45] <HotSauceFiend> until woolie hits the point in this fight were rng patterns occur
[2:02:46] <%riffsofdylheim> did we already check out on the game eh?

[2:03:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> EDGE
[2:03:40] <+Synthose_> Get out with that coward talk
[2:03:49] <Darmanimon> @Giothegame apparently the difficulty only changes how many hits you can take and how fast you regen health

[2:11:36] <%Renzaku69> \o/ so close
[2:11:37] <+Fetrigon> fuck this
[2:11:42] <GoblinPinkWizard> IT BETTER ONLY BE ONE
[2:11:43] <+Ricky_Rexx> Sorry I'm back did they do it of course not
[2:11:46] <Blank9> 2 of them
[2:11:48] <kadjah> hahah your whole allowance blown
[2:11:49] <HotSauceFiend> reggie dropping off his allowance at the arcade
[2:11:49] <%Proxzo> This is megalovania
[2:11:50] <%AceNugget> god they know where you want to feel safe
[2:11:52] <+Kitrane> just hit the tip of the hard guitar lol
[2:11:58] <+ArdentGamerIC> It goes on for like another two minutes or so even
[2:11:59] <Shwepie> 25¢ down the drain.
[2:12:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Just a dip of it
[2:12:10] <Zeneeba> nah. megalovania is easier than incinerator to me.
[2:12:11] <+ArdentGamerIC> it's too much
[2:12:22] <Champstice> @GoblinPinkWizard It's one quarter, but its got a string tied around it to pull it out and put it back in again
[2:12:24] <combustalemon_> fun fact: changing the difficulty does nothing in the Furnace
[2:12:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It would be Helltaker
[2:12:42] <+Jiggisnipe> ain't nothing wrong with a little burn Kappa
[2:12:43] <Darmanimon> I understand this feeling, it took me like $20 worth of quarters to beat TMNT Turtles in Time Arcade, but goddamn it I did beat it
[2:12:51] <%riffsofdylheim> q
[2:13:17] <Blank9> He’s believing

[2:13:42] <Darmanimon> got some good hits in
[2:13:47] <+ArdentGamerIC> Yeah, just watch a video
[2:13:47] <HotSauceFiend> no
[2:13:48] <combustalemon_> Nope
[2:13:52] <GoblinPinkWizard> i doubt it
[2:13:52] <BreakfastSampler> not for that one
[2:13:52] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Its sounds like a good ass song
[2:13:52] <unluckymarsbar> Some of that stuff ain't reactable, I think.
[2:13:53] <Fatty_Agoo> difficulty only changes health
[2:13:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> Someone said it doesnt change
[2:13:55] <combustalemon_> Gotta do Furnace the hard way
[2:13:59] <Zeneeba> difficulty changes your health and regen, it doesn't change the pattern
[2:14:10] <Shwepie> @Darmanimon Are arcades pay to win? rooThink
[2:14:20] <Darmanimon> @Darmanimon most definitely
[2:14:26] <+ArdentGamerIC> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[2:14:27] <Zeneeba> absolutely
[2:14:28] <BreakfastSampler> @Darmanimon there's no thought there. they are, literally the point
[2:14:29] <+Synthose_> They're pay to play
[2:14:32] <HotSauceFiend> did you at yourself
[2:14:42] <dukenux> okay, but life regen should still help
[2:14:47] <ZeeJiggle> This is the last quarter from Mom
[2:14:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> gotta get some rounds of Street fighter in with that last dollar
[2:15:00] <Aussie_Manny> BUT MOM, I KNOW I CAN WIN! D:
[2:15:09] <Zeneeba> @dukenux  we'll see
[2:15:23] <+Ricky_Rexx> die
[2:15:24] <combustalemon_> The furnace isn't a "Battle" so changing difficulty doesn't work
[2:15:26] <Darmanimon> xcalYamcha
[2:15:37] <+Byr0nX> @Aussie_Manny Its time for dinner!!
[2:15:38] <Shwepie> Mom! I need more quarters!

[2:16:24] <Champstice> @ArdentGamerIC I think maybe 30 minutes?
[2:16:25] <zzNamttamzz> The no hit video just discourages you from trying LUL
[2:16:34] <Darmanimon> yeah like 30 minutes max
[2:16:47] <+Ricky_Rexx> HALF USED?
[2:16:48] <ZeeJiggle> In what way, half used

[2:23:06] <Champstice> I will say: Borrowing the kinda nexus layout from yume nikki is kinda misleading since it's not quite as open as YN was
[2:23:07] <Zeneeba> they gave up XD
[2:23:21] <greatspaceadventure> @SharktheNerd my headcanon is that this is Geno's journey before arriving in SMRPG

[3:10:29] <jimgimp> This more like Ryosuke vs Hojo actually
[3:10:31] <a_bald_bro> oh yooooo this game rules, glad you're playing this!
[3:10:38] <+theoldone001> Seems like you have to perfect the run
[3:10:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> Gotta hit the booster
[3:10:47] <Asuterisuku> You're closer this time though.
[3:10:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> You basically have to never let go of the throttle
[3:10:51] <+CrownlessKitty> @HotSauceFiend all the characters use they/them actually
[3:10:55] <Champstice> I know saying "this track slaps" is kinda meaningless when the whole ost is filled with bops, but yo this track slaps

[3:11:08] <%jepupu> Three hydrant hits are too much
[3:11:08] <Asuterisuku> @Indigo_Automaton It seems like OutRun in that if you don't let go of the throttle you crash.

[3:12:56] <%andrewofbob> Out-in-out
[3:13:04] <SomeOtherNeb> oh, his tip was to play well
[3:13:05] <jimgimp> Racing games are more strategy than I realized until the last few years
[3:13:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> learning how to take corners is a good skill
[3:13:06] <%baka_sugoi> RACING LINES Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:13:11] <+Jiggisnipe> @Champstice yep
[3:13:14] <jimgimp> Ultra Lines
[3:13:14] <nyacoo> rip
[3:13:20] <Darmanimon> @Champstice yes, he's actually the reason Contra 4 is so hard cuz he tested the difficulty on it LUL
[3:13:29] <Champstice> Huh. Didn't know he worked in that too
[3:13:31] <tranquilturnip> for MK its all about the boost and none of my friends can do it right
[3:13:33] <FrostedZaibatsu> Zeek doesnt fuck up tho
[3:13:36] <+BuckySmalls> Takumi memorizing the line of Mt. Akina

[3:13:49] <TigerClaws12> rip
[3:13:58] <%Indigo_Automaton> I think you can fuck up and still win. I got first on my first attempt and I crashed once
[3:14:08] <+S3xGAZEBO> the racing line is not the inside line
[3:14:09] <jimgimp> In Mayro Krat you have to drift even if going straight is faster
[3:14:11] <Champstice> It is mostly remembering those damn hydrants
[3:14:16] <tranquilturnip> @jimgimp exactly
[3:14:32] <jimgimp> Only way to get constant boost

[3:15:03] <+S3xGAZEBO> The crazy part is that when racing other people who know the racing line, you don't always follow the racing line to win
[3:15:04] <Rav3Games> looks like you gotta get sub 3

[4:32:11] <Champstice> What? It's a lip piercing guys
[4:32:15] <greatspaceadventure> hot take: foam adventure is only hateful to you because you WISH you had that level of brazen, blind self-confidence
[4:32:21] <BlackermanZX> thats a good stick
[4:32:40] <Asuterisuku> Maybe the shopkeep?
[4:32:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1486261185653657607?t=TY33I0sz3hRhHS78nrxA2g&s=19
[4:32:50] <DSD24> @greatspaceadventure I mean my main issue is that I didn't know why they need foam to begin with
[4:33:09] <Uselesswhitenoise> I've watched this game several times and I just had a thought just now. Is the stick a small reference to the starting weapon of undertale?
[4:33:22] <LittleSiberianBear> I heard you Leik mudkips
[4:33:29] <cj_art> humor was so innocent back then
[4:33:30] <DSD24> Theme of cute bunnies
[4:33:36] <Hammatime8> Bun? Bun!
[4:33:36] <+Kitrane> sticks are a staple jrpg starter weapon
[4:33:39] <greatspaceadventure> @Uselesswhitenoise maybe! i will say, Lucas' starting weapon in Mother 3 is a stick
[4:33:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> There's some very cool stuff in the mushroom forest left to see. You may get locked out of it if you go through the broken frame

[4:34:45] <Asuterisuku> You've already missed it.
[4:35:01] <coziestbank> I don't know why they don't make the green door the forest lol.
[4:35:04] <ArcaneMusic> Eyy it's fine, this game has tons of NG+ content
[4:35:10] <Asuterisuku> Fixing the door was the PoNR.
[4:35:10] <$ArCielArDor> the rabbit is not skippable
[4:35:15] <greatspaceadventure> the gen after Z is going to SUPER HARD latch onto penguin of d00m and every generation before them will absolutely rue them for it, mark my words
[4:35:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> The Mushroom door on the top left of the hub

[4:36:25] <MadBaller123> I can't beleive they've been playing for so long, my eyes are tired from the buddha boss
[4:36:33] <Champstice> oh thank goodness
[4:36:45] <greatspaceadventure> the Buddha boss is basically there to tell you "be ready for LITERALLY anything"
[4:36:50] <%Indigo_Automaton> Hide & Seek was a hint you were given earlier in the game

[4:38:12] <Champstice> Only Shroomin after all
[4:38:14] <Tisaric> I mean the full title itself has like 5 different Shpongle references LUL
[4:38:16] <+Jiggisnipe> fart gas shroom
[4:38:19] <%Prevot> sure would he a shame if they changed the mushroom footwear right before being hit by a child slavery lawsuit
[4:38:23] <devanmuse> One of the mushrooms is going to be blocked from view by the foreground, I'll bet
[4:38:25] <SomeOtherNeb> SourPls
[4:38:27] <DSD24> They gave the Green M n M some shoes rather then her heels

[4:38:53] <DSD24> I like how chill Brown is
[4:39:03] <Uselesswhitenoise> @DSD24 fun fact: the shoue thing is getting push to cover up the company getting sued for child salvery
[4:39:07] <coziestbank> I love the blue one's wiggle
[4:39:13] <JayCue_yt> Man this seems like a very fun and nice game. it would be a shame if somebody were to shit themselves while playing it
[4:39:22] <DSD24> @Uselesswhitenoise That I didn't know so that's extra screwed up
[4:39:29] <greatspaceadventure> @DSD24 in reality it had quite the opposite effect
[4:39:31] <+Toficque> what's up with RPGs and hide and seekl
[4:39:36] <Champstice> @JayCue_yt yeah, sounds like spreading jerms

[4:40:24] <LittleSiberianBear> @WoolieVersus oh that? it's also censorship of the green M&M.   hmm.

[4:40:35] <teefpal> super super cool
[4:40:35] <zettig> Nestle, Mars, and Hershey fwiw

[4:40:54] <Spagheddies> @S3xGAZEBO M&Ms
[4:40:58] <kingra> Spending too much time in the forest will make you BASED
[4:41:00] <LittleSiberianBear> @SomeOtherNeb honestly. both are bad. it's still corporate censorship and "changing tastes"  it's control of bodies and minds.
[4:41:04] <greatspaceadventure> just enslave the M&Ms to make more M&Ms Kappa
[4:41:05] <SomeOtherNeb> @S3xGAZEBO M&Ms redesigning their mascots to distract people from their child labour scnadal
[4:41:10] <%Orcapugs> Pull ‘‘em back Reggie

[4:41:46] <DarknessHS> LUL
[4:41:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> I'm a big fan of mushrooms and also people with big hats, so that guy is pretty cool
[4:41:53] <SomeOtherNeb> @SomeOtherNeb a meaningless design change isn't "controlling bodies and minds" dude
[4:41:56] <vedajuno> they can sniff them out like pigs
[4:41:59] <SomeOtherNeb> it's just vapid PR
[4:41:59] <MadBaller123> but do these guys pack a punch
[4:42:01] <LittleSiberianBear> and censorship and slavery and other shit go hand in hand, remember when Activision blizzard also censored WoW ... while sex harassments was going on?
[4:42:04] <alroy909> well SOME people are feeling very strongly about the fact that they don't feel like they want to fuck the green mm anymore it seems... child slavery is ok tho it seems
[4:42:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Dude
[4:42:21] <LittleSiberianBear> @SomeOtherNeb if it's meaningless, then why change it? enough of that apologia
[4:42:26] <greatspaceadventure> @JayCue_yt ask it nicely and you might get an Elizabeth mushroom
[4:42:35] <LittleSiberianBear> @alroy909 BOTH ARE BAD.
[4:42:41] <coziestbank> I think the last one was left of save point
[4:42:41] <LittleSiberianBear> the slavery more so but god dang
[4:42:48] <SomeOtherNeb> @SomeOtherNeb because it's a distraction, stop acting like it's on the same level as child slavery wtf
[4:42:51] <+Synthose_> Seems unlikely
[4:42:55] <teefpal> @SomeOtherNeb This message is giving me Petersonian vibes
[4:42:56] <coziestbank> like a little half-path
[4:43:09] <KyberNasse> The children are small so you can save on sleeping space. Think sardines
[4:43:09] <Ides42> can you turn while running on water?
[4:43:10] <+Jiggisnipe> are you actually arguing that changing designs is a big deal?
[4:43:12] <Lagseene_> @alroy909 But the green mm tho
[4:43:14] <LittleSiberianBear> @SomeOtherNeb i'm not i'm not saying it's on the same level. but every time.
[4:43:28] <SomeOtherNeb> @SomeOtherNeb Hershey's is trying to elevate a new sexual archetype (hottest M&M)
[4:43:31] <LittleSiberianBear> @SomeOtherNeb what does that even mean?
[4:43:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> wholesome
[4:43:50] <rasamune> After careful consideration, I have decided that I would fuck the green M&M, because she looks like a girl. I would not fuck the red or yellow M&M
[4:44:03] <SomeOtherNeb> @SomeOtherNeb it means I replied to the wrong comment LUL
[4:44:17] <Lagseene_> @rasamune Understandable and respectable
[4:44:22] <alroy909> yeah yeah child slavery bad and all, but the shoes tho XD
[4:44:28] <coziestbank> nah its all in this zone
[4:44:45] <%Prevot> real talk though, I hate the brown m&m character, cause it just looks naked
[4:44:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> The End's fight is so cool
[4:44:47] <Champstice> did he check up by the save point?
[4:44:52] <LittleSiberianBear> @SomeOtherNeb a mascot being changed to stop harm... while the company causes real harm.
[4:44:57] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[4:45:04] <+Kitrane> I always did the time trick where you set the console time to 5 years later to kill him of old age
[4:45:06] <Asuterisuku> Just turn off your system and  move your system's time ahead about a year LUL
[4:45:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[4:45:38] <LittleSiberianBear> @alroy909 wel yeah. some how they think a cartoon m&m being a woman is "harmful" and more important than fixing slavery
[4:45:42] <GarbageNirvana> You know you can kill the End the moment you see him in the wheelchair right
[4:45:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> waynerGoChimp
[4:46:12] <%DashXero> Mushrooms in the forest having a party... There MUST be drugs involved.
[4:46:13] <+Kitrane> I think if you kill him there you cant tranq his parrot to eat though
[4:46:14] <BlackermanZX> the wheelchair kill is amazing

[4:46:44] <LittleSiberianBear> @SomeOtherNeb ... it is changed because people want to "stop harm" from a fictional character. while they cause harm.  via child slavery. it's shit.

[4:48:37] <SomeOtherNeb> I want to enjoy mushroom time
[4:48:42] <Tisaric> I love how much you can tell the devs loved Shpongle from this game
[4:48:44] <LittleSiberianBear> @SomeOtherNeb ah. thanks because yeah. censorship sucks.  and it's always done by those who do really bad stuff. i notice a trend or twenty
[4:48:52] <Tisaric> also it's time for HARD DRUGS
[4:48:58] <alroy909> @LittleSiberianBear look i see you are feeling very strongly about this but i kinda don't understand why the company trying to win supposed brownie points with mascots changes is like... something that deserves really mentioning when there's child slavery

[4:58:18] <devanmuse> I hope you come back to this game. The back half is a fucking TRIP.
[4:58:19] <+swymbiote> the game definitely has more to show so i'm excited to see it
[4:58:28] <Uselesswhitenoise> so hows musical undertale?
[4:58:31] <+S3xGAZEBO> I'm ashamed to admit I have totally been "that guy" on shrooms
[4:58:31] <Champstice> would be a shame to get this far and not finish, even if the rest was off-stream

[5:00:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit that was fast
[5:00:56] <CaptainInvictus> @WoolieVersus there's a few tracks that aren't in the OST like Gunnar Olson's Barge. The game gets wild past here so I hope you continue the game on stream at another time!
[5:00:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1486261185653657607?t=TY33I0sz3hRhHS78nrxA2g&s=19

[5:01:24] <Zeneeba> hell yeah!
[5:01:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> YEAH DRUGS
[5:01:29] <%baka_sugoi> Trip Simulator
[5:01:29] <+JustToWatch> Woolie you've only been playing for 4 minutes
[5:01:34] <+Grayhammatter> undertale: drugs
[5:01:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Heck yeah!
[5:01:35] <Zeneeba> i'll be back to watch it too!
[5:01:38] <BlackermanZX> Music & drugs
[5:01:41] <+Saggitori> weed goat
[5:01:42] <CaptainInvictus> it's so much more than drugs lol
[5:01:42] <Tisaric> the subtitle is literally just like 4 Shpongle songs tied together LUL
[5:01:43] <+BadassCyborg3000> Undertale Drugs is just Earthbound Mr. Saturn section
[5:01:46] <@Solidus_113> Everhood has custom battle support too
[5:01:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> UnderDrugs
[5:01:59] <%baka_sugoi> the light show
[5:02:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I’m here for more undertale/earthbound things with hella bops
[5:02:16] <+Akizea> this game is so goddamn cool
[5:02:22] <Champstice> Shout-out to one of the devs going "okay, Someone is gonna make a megalovania custom battle, MIGHT AS WELL BE ME"
[5:02:27] <%mr_sups> Drugger Tale
[5:03:22] <FrostedZaibatsu> Still best looking game on PS5
[5:03:31] <%Irridium> I like how you can make actual humans in the character creator
[5:03:39] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> still no 60fps update for PS5 Bloodborne 😔😔
[5:03:55] <%AyotoCorp> That exists
[5:03:55] <%RaziWraith> It's almost like if they did a remaster/remake of Bloodborne, it would be a hit! :)
[5:04:09] <%mr_sups> Unless you are talking to Alvina
[5:04:11] <+JustToWatch> Pick one of these communist or fascist responses of fuck off
[5:04:16] <kulmoth> "No" Okay fuck you *uninstalls itself*
[5:04:26] <%mr_sups> Jake the Dog
[5:04:27] <%mr_sups> !
[5:04:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> BAIKEN TOMORROW UUUOOOOOO
[5:04:46] <%AyotoCorp> 3 specifically
[5:04:51] <%Prevot> I guess
[5:04:51] <Asuterisuku> I disagree.
[5:05:34] <%Prevot> 1 > 3 > 2
[5:05:36] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> all Primes had their good shit
[5:05:37] <Asuterisuku> 2 is the best.
[5:05:59] <+TheOlMitcheroo> What game are they talking about?
[5:06:04] <Asuterisuku> With the exception of the Key Hunt.
[5:06:04] <%Prevot> I hate so much of 2
[5:06:27] <Asuterisuku> At least in 1 you could get a few of the keys in advance.
[5:06:33] <KyberNasse> Scanning and exploring is the bread and butter of Primes so I dont know how rail shooter would work
[5:06:41] <Asuterisuku> And in 3 you only need a few of the keys to beat the game.
[5:07:17] <%mr_sups> Granted a Metroid Prime rail shooter spin-off would kick ass.
[5:07:24] <%mr_sups> Light Suit is GOAT tho.
[5:07:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The controls of 3 were the biggest change
[5:07:58] <%mr_sups> Link's Crossbow training Metroid edditon
[5:07:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:08:07] <Asuterisuku> I still say Prime 4 needs a new subtitle. Prime is done.
[5:08:20] <%Prevot> honestly don't know if I would've gotten into the prime games without the wiimote aiming
[5:08:32] <%AyotoCorp> I really am
[5:08:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> lmao
[5:08:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie-kun...
[5:08:43] <Asuterisuku> Oh that's a mistake.
[5:08:51] <@Solidus_113> they're all the same movie
[5:08:59] <%Prevot> lol I did that with Mission Impossible
[5:09:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Jesus Christ that's Jason Bourne again!"
[5:09:46] <Asuterisuku> And don't forget the shakycam fighting that you can't actually follow.
[5:09:54] <+BadassCyborg3000> That's the one with Jeremy Renner
[5:09:55] <Asuterisuku> The Bourne Legacy.
[5:09:57] <%mr_sups> Yes with Hawkeye-man
[5:10:01] <+Jiggisnipe> yea with Jeremy Renner
[5:10:18] <Asuterisuku> Written by Eric Van Lustbader rather than Eric Ludlum.
[5:10:23] <%baka_sugoi> OMG it's JASON BOURNE
[5:10:37] <%mr_sups> Same with Persona
[5:10:49] <Asuterisuku> I run through the Trilogy every couple of years, it's a good time.
[5:10:53] <%AyotoCorp> There's a game called "GLITCHED" where an NPC will literally permanently remove part of the game's UI if you tell him "no" too much
[5:11:04] <%Prevot> I went into Prime playing all 3 back to back and 2 suffered the most from it
[5:11:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I had more burnout from Persona 5 on it's own than the Prime trilogy lol
[5:11:22] <%mr_sups> new LP?
[5:11:27] <%Prevot> 1 and 3 are different enough, but 2 felt like a immediate setpdown
[5:11:42] <GHouseduivel> Clap
[5:11:44] <Asuterisuku> 2 was 1's mechanics polished for the most part. I like it more.
[5:12:07] <BlackermanZX> good ol Bacon
[5:12:13] <+theoldone001> What's after Miles Morales?
[5:12:14] <+EySoyCoco> booba stream

[5:12:30] <+BadassCyborg3000> Going from DS2 into DS3 left me a bit burnt out. Nioh has been a good change of pace.
