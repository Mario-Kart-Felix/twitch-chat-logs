[0:01:43] <deafmelone> ive been waiting for this
[0:02:20] <+Hanooodle> wanna say before i lurk , love the content , you're keeping me going woolie <3
[0:02:24] <fernanda_ps2> WELCOME TO THE FFS
[0:02:36] <Super_Voltekka> Only Capcom can make a phrase like "bootleg MUGEN" not an oxymoron
[0:03:47] <highscorebros> yo
[0:04:21] <deafmelone> if this game had like 4 more characters per series represented, it would be decent
[0:04:37] <SoromopsDucky> Why are there so many MUGEN Screenpacks for this game
[0:04:52] <lazerscraper> OH NO
[0:05:10] <Applecannon63> A game what everyone wanted but it is made by Ono‚Ä¶
[0:05:14] <%Grimlockfly> Cheer500 in theory I love what‚Äôs goin on here with ‚ÄòCapcom Mugen‚Äô but there‚Äôs waaaaay too few fighters given all the reused assets. More fighters and a better UI woulda been a good time. Capcom KOF now plz.
[0:05:27] <HelluvaNohbody> Oh boy, time for the best fighting game evar
[0:05:37] <%Grimlockfly> @deafmelone that‚Äôs right
[0:06:15] <DaKnightWarrior> oh no. INGRID.
[0:06:15] <deafmelone> I actually like the hit sound effects in this game
[0:06:17] <ndcoten> oh boy it's Capcom Fumble Jumble

[0:07:08] <DaKnightWarrior> I don't really mind Ingrid. I just find it funny that so many people hate her.
[0:07:17] <HelluvaNohbody> Ingrid is basically an KoF character
[0:07:18] <Applecannon63> Hell there was that planned 3D capcom fighter that got canned
[0:07:23] <%patriotrenegade> ‚ÄúAll warfare is based‚Äù -Sun Tzu

[0:15:36] <%patriotrenegade> I expect nothing.
[0:15:47] <pmda2126> all we are is dust in the wind - Smash online
[0:15:47] <%patriotrenegade> And yet, I am still disappointed
[0:16:02] <TigerClaws12> Koreans aren't dumping their PCs

[0:17:56] <MrBaconJam> The only way for them to get better is to give them a SEGA-tier humbling. Basically, go 3rd party.

[0:27:29] <ThatDamnTyrant> Proto Dante?
[0:27:31] <+mechatengu21> is this from before KOF Maximum Impact?
[0:27:35] <Hessman212> So K' mixed with Benimaru
[0:27:35] <+Darky04> Dante. Devil.
[0:27:37] <blackkanye> Watching this makes me think Bloody Roar
[0:27:40] <+GalacticaPhanto> @mordexai0 I know it isn't, I was making a dumb joke

[0:28:00] <Qsmash_> weird round system
[0:28:01] <%ChoculaUltra> wait like a break break
[0:28:04] <+Mordexai0> This was being made by ARIKA by the way
[0:28:08] <%ChoculaUltra> as in everyone take 5 and grab some snacks break?
[0:28:15] <lazerscraper> thats just ewgf
[0:28:17] <+mechatengu21> atpCap
[0:28:18] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> Like real anime
[0:28:20] <horsesaredumb> like an anime scene?
[0:28:25] <cj_art> proto wager system
[0:28:27] <pmda2126> story stuff perhaps
[0:28:30] <%ZeeJiggle> Wipe the sweat off your palms maybe.
[0:28:34] <deafmelone> @woolieversus are you going show the trailer?
[0:28:37] <pixel_river> i want marvel gameplay with capcom pnly
[0:28:39] <+Pugweight> oh man id die for that
[0:28:41] <+emeraldsplasher> ARIKA was developing this btw
[0:28:43] <+Ultimate_Edge> A great idea that they can't seem to execute right for whatever reason
[0:28:44] <%ChoculaUltra> there were probably dramatic breaks with lore characters. At least I hope there were
[0:28:44] <Applecannon63> its looks a like a glorified pause?
[0:28:49] <%KetsuoTaberu> Take that!
[0:28:50] <Hessman212> SFV has sort become that
[0:28:54] <Adwark> Forced reset back to neutral with bit of flair.
[0:29:09] <+b_aleph> SEGA!!!
[0:29:21] <%kewlmyc> Eh, I'd say 3rd best at this point
[0:29:22] <fIashman92> Sega and Square Enix
[0:29:22] <+mechatengu21> atpJuntao
[0:29:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Capcom fatalities monkaS
[0:29:25] <+b_aleph> Capcom is an easy thrid tho
[0:29:25] <+thedream_c> fightan Jamz?
[0:29:25] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> yo more 3d ryu
[0:29:28] <RaidenRising> teppen is capcom all stars in tcg form
[0:29:30] <Solidnick18> oh
[0:29:30] <+Demahu8029> Demahu8029 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[0:29:32] <+thedream_c> oh wait
[0:29:33] <brexdq> jump Force but a 2d fighter would be cool
[0:29:39] <Applecannon63> the problem because Ono issues of prioritizing the budget
[0:29:40] <%ChoculaUltra> Dramatic Mortal Fatal Finish Kappa
[0:29:46] <+Mordexai0> @brexdq That's just Infinite Versus
[0:29:49] <deafmelone> There is a trailer
[0:29:51] <MrBaconJam> "2nd Best" Nah, bump it up to 1st. EleGiggle
[0:29:51] <+thedream_c> damn this ingrid 3d model

[0:30:37] <Tochma> Wonder what happened to the arcade cabinets

[0:31:09] <+thedream_c> but yeah Final Fight has been kneedeep in SF lore to some degree with the alpha series
[0:31:09] <+Mordexai0> This was being made by ARIKA @woolieversus
[0:31:11] <+fredan31> I used to scour The gamespot website when I first heard about this game
[0:31:13] <%ChoculaUltra> and then they took the idea and made Teppen Kappa
[0:31:15] <+thedream_c> ohhh Arika
[0:31:17] <deafmelone> Yuuup
[0:31:28] <armchairmaster_> W H A T?

[0:32:00] <+thedream_c> POison POison
[0:32:02] <+fredan31> I miss early 2000 Gamespot
[0:32:04] <fIashman92> Sega was able to make a crossover fighting game based off of just ONE division's IPs alone
[0:32:05] <Solidnick18> potato PogChamp
[0:32:12] <+xerotwo> O O F
[0:32:16] <%saladin1911> D.D
[0:32:17] <+thedream_c> conceptually looks good
[0:32:20] <blackkanye> Justt a dude strider looks cool
[0:32:24] <lazerscraper> DANGER
[0:32:26] <+thedream_c> and 3 new cummers
[0:32:26] <+mechatengu21> do we have hi-res for the art that just appeared?!
[0:32:26] <Darren716> This is so 2003 it hurts
[0:32:27] <BlackermanZX> MAN its a shame they didnt release it
[0:32:28] <+thedream_c> coomers I mean
[0:32:29] <lazerscraper> HIGH VOLTAGE
[0:32:30] <pixel_river> Jebaited
[0:32:32] <pmda2126> this looks cool
[0:32:34] <Divum_muviD> nice font
[0:32:36] <BlackermanZX> not even a demo or something
[0:32:36] <Super_Voltekka> I really hope the prototype gets dumped one day so we can play it on MAME
[0:32:36] <%ChoculaUltra> and then Capcom said back to the pits with you LUL
[0:32:38] <Hessman212> was his name Code:Rage?
[0:32:40] <alphalejandro> In Winter...NEVER
[0:32:41] <%saladin1911> D.D. just seems like an inverted K' with electricity instead of fire lmao. I dig it
[0:32:41] <DaKnightWarrior> In arcades this never.
[0:32:42] <DrunkenDice> lock it up away in the vault
[0:32:46] <%Jiggisnipe> that's Teppen
[0:32:48] <Darren716> Teppen?
[0:32:48] <%ChoculaUltra> holy quality jump
[0:32:49] <diontmack> we have teppen Kappa
[0:32:54] <pixel_river> other fgs than SF
[0:32:56] <+thedream_c> Capcom VS 4 but actualy treat it right
[0:32:59] <$Dungeon00X> Cool with Streetwise? DarkMode
[0:33:03] <+thedream_c> yeah exactly
[0:33:09] <+thedream_c> Capcom Versus Infinite Z
[0:33:09] <Qsmash_> "Streetwise was shit" -Mikami
[0:33:23] <%LastHazzerd> Capcom Maximum Forces
[0:33:24] <+fredan31> is Capcom the worst at managing their IPs?
[0:33:25] <feralknights> I actually enjoyed CFE/CFJ but I understand the layers of it not being a good game.  I was kind of starved for access to games back then.
[0:33:27] <+thedream_c> oh yeah Akira is tryign to make it to SFV
[0:33:28] <curryweek> I very much dig bomber jacket Alex
[0:33:29] <liishuwen> akira!
[0:33:29] <RaidenRising> leon
[0:33:31] <lazerscraper> DRAMATIC COUNTER
[0:33:31] <%Jiggisnipe> Breath of Fire :)
[0:33:32] <Solidnick18> sick
[0:33:44] <brexdq> make a capcom All-Star fighting and then make another Marvel Superheroes done and done
[0:33:44] <%ChoculaUltra> Leon Kennedy will never be an RE rep in a versus style game FeelsBadMan
[0:33:45] <+thedream_c> TvC vibes with this too
[0:33:48] <MrBaconJam> @fredan31 Nah. Nintendo
[0:33:52] <+mechatengu21> Batsu just did the Asuka Kazamer rage art
[0:33:54] <Super_Voltekka> Ragnarok Pog
[0:33:55] <DaKnightWarrior> That's cool.
[0:33:56] <%jinking79> bring back RUBY HEART
[0:34:03] <+thedream_c> TvC was the last time we saw a mid tier Alex
[0:34:09] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> BIG
[0:34:09] <+logoth_> BIGINNING
[0:34:10] <Darren716> LUL
[0:34:12] <+Pugweight> biginning
[0:34:12] <anarchistPastry> BIGINNING
[0:34:13] <mrpandabear437> yo that was ryus v trigger 2?!!!!!
[0:34:13] <+thedream_c> and Ryu was actually swag as fuckin TvC as well
[0:34:14] <Solidnick18> biginning
[0:34:15] <ajmgamesdev> That reminds me of Chipp from Strive
[0:34:16] <deafmelone> Ryu had a TETSUZANKO
[0:34:16] <alphalejandro> Capcom was afraid of the game receiving the reception as KOF Maximum Impact
[0:34:19] <AstrodropGaming> zyzxLmao zyzxLmao zyzxLmao
[0:34:20] <+fredan31> @mrbaconjam I mean they have the biggest IPS but at least they made Smash Brothers
[0:34:21] <Adwark> It feels kind of funny to see that this Strider thing is kinda alike to GG Strive Chipp super
[0:34:22] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:34:24] <%X2Eliah> Honestly who needs fighting games when you have Sekiro Owl (Father) fight
[0:34:31] <+thedream_c> CANNdcelled
[0:34:36] <Applecannon63> Ryu's Final Punch
[0:34:37] <Solidnick18> classic capcpom
[0:34:38] <Darren716> I neve had a chance to bigin
[0:34:39] <+mechatengu21> the art....
[0:34:42] <iamtheTwitchghost> dat ryu
[0:34:45] <+thedream_c> WOW 16 chars so little for 2020 :p
[0:34:46] <+The_Death_Owl> I wonder if the ROM still exists somewhere
[0:34:46] <+Mordexai0> GUILTY GEAR VIBES
[0:34:47] <$Dungeon00X> Yep, that looks like Shinkiro's artwork
[0:34:48] <%emptyantics> WHY IS STRIDER SO SICK
[0:34:50] <%ChoculaUltra> surely the source code has to exist on some random dev kit lying around in some locker or something, right?!
[0:34:51] <DedlokPM> DAN?
[0:34:54] <+thedream_c> but CFN portal has them tho LMAO
[0:34:55] <DedlokPM> doodSurvive
[0:34:58] <Mathochism> K' was also supposed to be a guest character in this.
[0:35:00] <Qsmash_> people hated it apparently
[0:35:07] <+thedream_c> CFN portal got the most obscure chars in the database
[0:35:07] <alphalejandro> Maximum Impact happen
[0:35:20] <+emeraldsplasher> K' was supposed to be a guest character @woolieversus
[0:35:21] <OOPScrublord> I came in looking at hype, and get told it got canceled. WHY
[0:35:29] <JayEarly> if Leon gets in a VS game he better have a suplex command grab
[0:35:29] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't blame them - Capcom and 3D fighters have been hit or miss since the EX series
[0:35:30] <%Jiggisnipe> CvS2?
[0:35:34] <deafmelone> The finishers apparently had nonsense input to do them
[0:35:34] <Applecannon63> same people that didn't appreciate New Generation
[0:35:35] <+thedream_c> the wading pool of 3d FGs
[0:35:40] <+xerotwo> INCLUDING GG ISUKA
[0:35:41] <brunoberserk> maybe because was too similar to maximum impact
[0:35:49] <BlackermanZX> yo screw those arcade people wooliePOYO

[0:37:37] <+thedream_c> mhw is nepotism that saved Capcom to some degree financially
[0:37:37] <Skeletonmanners> @WoolieVersus actually Ono's first game as a director was fucking CHAOS LEGION
[0:37:46] <+thedream_c> ah the forgotten Chaos Legion

[0:38:01] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Super_Voltekka
[0:38:06] <brunoberserk> JUST FUCK IT ! DO A MUGEN !!
[0:38:10] <BlackermanZX> worse mugen really
[0:38:11] <+BuckizcoBeet> It does sound like a MUGEN project.
[0:38:12] <alphalejandro> We got instead a worse MVC2
[0:38:13] <DingusMcBaseball> dont talk shit about mugen tho
[0:38:14] <Klefth> @thedream_c TBF, Ryozo has been doing a great job with MH
[0:38:16] <deafmelone> I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall played red earth before this
[0:38:18] <+fredan31> if they're going to use Morgan they should use the old 2D Sprite I don't care if it's a 3D game
[0:38:19] <%Jiggisnipe> clash is the correct term in more ways than one
[0:38:20] <DomonTrigger> This version has a way better roster on paper though
[0:38:20] <+emeraldsplasher> MUGEN is better than this
[0:38:21] <+xerotwo> This came around the near same timeframe as SVC CHAOS doodStare
[0:38:26] <JayEarly> @thedream_c yeah somehow that worked
[0:38:30] <michaelpolandwatcher> Hello Woolie can i interest you in a Witcher 2?
[0:38:31] <Qsmash_> they literally just threw all that shit away and went back to sprites
[0:38:37] <DingusMcBaseball> MUGEN is as good as the guy making the project is willing to make it
[0:38:40] <TigerClaws12> don't play your main

[0:38:48] <@Solidus_113> Persona was the worst with it
[0:38:50] <+thedream_c> @Klefth yeah. The bottom line and quality worked out so until it stops, then the strategy is legit. MHW and RE team carrying the company for now.

[1:06:29] <+BuckizcoBeet> *Me neither
[1:06:30] <dds333a> At all. that's why it's the FIGHTING EVOLUTION
[1:06:31] <%ggbhtg> A great introduction for fighting game newbies :)
[1:06:32] <%patriotrenegade> No power steering
[1:06:33] <SilentStarPlatinum> LUL
[1:06:34] <Applecannon63> Do You UNDERSTAND?
[1:06:34] <b_ikki> s kill pedals
[1:06:40] <Ragezorx> so its just like bbtag then? people really despise when characters are modified / gimped
[1:06:41] <Solidnick18> oh shit wrong car
[1:06:41] <+vaporousTippler> Capcom Fighting Evolution. The fighting game that belongs in the damn shop.
[1:06:44] <Thunderhog> It's like driving a american car after living in europe
[1:06:47] <%KetsuoTaberu> SourPls
[1:06:50] <+MrGooseberryVT> We really got this instead of the other ingrid game
[1:06:56] <+GreyFox86> YES!!!
[1:06:59] <TheKazuma410> And we get a GREAT character select theme
[1:07:00] <VladDamien> LMAO
[1:07:00] <Blank9> it's 10 horses tied together
[1:07:02] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL

[1:07:08] <VladDamien> Reggie plz
[1:07:08] <SableS139a> @MrGooseberryVT Sadly...
[1:07:10] <+thedream_c> lmaooo fake bacon
[1:07:14] <goztboy> this character select bgm sucks lol
[1:07:15] <dds333a> It's as if the stick had all it's labels moved
[1:07:17] <+thedream_c> turkey faked bacon
[1:07:18] <Solidnick18> Facon hmmm
[1:07:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Adapt Reggie
[1:07:20] <%patriotrenegade> I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not Street Fighter!
[1:07:21] <BlackermanZX> the speedometer is missing some numbers
[1:07:24] <leith_aziz> I now see why I loved Strive so much despite some changes. It doesnt get to this point of feeling stripped down while also adding new moves and mechanics
[1:07:26] <+Mordexai0> Fun Fact: Ingrid has Egyptian Goddess references in her clothes and street fighter alpha 3 max lore.
[1:07:28] <+thedream_c> hahah Hauzer
[1:07:30] <%Jiggisnipe> naw
[1:07:32] <+thedream_c> big DINO energy
[1:07:33] <Super_Voltekka> There's a statue of Ravange in the background
[1:07:34] <tragicjohnson84> What is Hauzer from?
[1:07:34] <JdotSweapA> suddenly Dinosaurs...
[1:07:36] <nicversus> That's exactly what Marvel vs Capcom Infinite feels like. It's the facon bits version of MvC
[1:07:36] <%emptyantics> IMAGINE FAKE BACON ConcernDoge
[1:07:36] <SableS139a> The OG project looked super promising too...
[1:07:37] <dds333a> Possibly, yeah
[1:07:38] <%ggbhtg> THAT'S WHAT ONO SAID THO
[1:07:38] <+eanscrale> can you blame them?
[1:07:40] <leith_aziz> Well..... this is weird
[1:07:43] <Solidnick18> it will eventually
[1:07:43] <+Mcmoblin> This game really doesn't count.
[1:07:45] <+Shmario> suddenly well animated characters
[1:07:47] <+GreyFox86> riptors mom
[1:07:47] <Ragezorx> well ono is gone so ingrid will never come back
[1:07:48] <%Jiggisnipe> they're like we already did Capcom vs Capcom Kappa
[1:07:48] <leith_aziz> WHAT KILLED THE DINOSAURS ?
[1:07:50] <pmda2126> this is a cool matchup though
[1:07:50] <SableS139a> @tragicjohnson84 Red Earth/Warzard
[1:07:50] <+MrGooseberryVT> This game is the reason all we get is street fighter costumes for crossovers now
[1:07:52] <%ThatGuyThere03> I feel like this game failing has more to do with the fact that this looks about as polished as some random mugen pack
[1:07:55] <armchairmaster_> what the fuck is that sprite
[1:07:55] <DaKnightWarrior> I love Red Earth so much.
[1:07:57] <%Irridium> with Ono gone maybe they'll try again... hopefully
[1:07:58] <+thedream_c> ho that sweep tho
[1:07:59] <Applecannon63> Ono the CG trailer whore
[1:07:59] <leith_aziz> THE ICE AAAAGGGGEEEE
[1:08:00] <dds333a> Red Earth has always looked amazing
[1:08:00] <%emptyantics> SourPls
[1:08:06] <pmda2126> dino vs star space god
[1:08:07] <+thedream_c> this is like TvC giants but were REALLY unfair
[1:08:14] <+Mordexai0> @ragezorx Nah Bring her Back. Better than ever.
[1:08:14] <Solidnick18> what is that noise?
[1:08:16] <MrBaconJam> DINOSAURS VS ALIENS PogChamp
[1:08:16] <+GalacticaPhanto> Ok so real talk this theme is a odd guilty pleasure because I actually like this one
[1:08:21] <RealDurdyDan> This looks like a boss battle

[1:09:11] <Darren716> Reggie they didn't have time to think
[1:09:20] <+thedream_c> shitty alex? Not until u play TvC really
[1:09:21] <mr_sups> @oni_exe this game is that statement as a fighting game
[1:09:23] <+Willdog1993> Light as a feather, STIFF AS A BOARD!
[1:09:26] <nicversus> This is like somebody handed ono a copy of mugen
[1:09:27] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> why aare the cutframes so RANDOM
[1:09:30] <+Mordexai0> the Goddess is lsls by the way
[1:09:30] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Alex forgot all his frames at home

[1:09:46] <+logoth_> Slow as hell fucking EX
[1:09:52] <Solidnick18> at ease ... loser
[1:09:55] <Adwark> This must have been some kind of competition "How fast you can push out seemingly complete game" LUL
[1:10:02] <dds333a> HE DOESN'T LOSE
[1:10:12] <+MrGooseberryVT> I swear Ingrid was in Tekken and Maximum Impact just the same character 3 times
[1:10:12] <LocalELizard> begone mollusk
[1:10:12] <leith_aziz> I wish Alex was played more in games. I find him a pretty cool character
[1:10:12] <+NopeBadguy> That was Bison levels of EX stomp floatiness
[1:10:23] <+thedream_c> game design? Nah lets put out a big crossover game
[1:10:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> This feels like a 9 month project
[1:10:24] <DedlokPM> https://clips.twitch.tv/ConsiderateFurryCamelSMOrc-JGRaha3-nr_YMNJf
[1:10:25] <goztboy> poor Reggie lol
[1:10:27] <deafmelone> You gotta do midnight bliss
[1:10:27] <%thespacerunaway> Gracious. I haven't thought about red earth in years
[1:10:30] <%ggbhtg> Are we really forcing Reggie to play this for the rest of the stream?
[1:10:32] <anarchistPastry> my day just keeps getting better  LUL
[1:10:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is an anger DECADES in the making
[1:10:35] <%Jiggisnipe> does Demitri have Midnight Bliss?
[1:10:38] <dds333a> Reggie taking damage from this game
[1:10:43] <nicversus> I'm dismayed at the lack of Mega Man 2 The Power Fighters representation in this game
[1:10:43] <leith_aziz> @MrGooseberryVT You're thinking of Lily for Tekken
[1:10:43] <+thedream_c> there are some 2020 fgs that look half baked but still are more complete than this game
[1:10:46] <deafmelone> @jiggisnipe Yes
[1:10:57] <DaKnightWarrior> This stage gets me everytime LUL
[1:11:01] <+Mordexai0> @applecannon63 The reason she's Mary sue is because she's a reference to Egyptian Goddess lsls. Also probably because she  is likely made by Ono
[1:11:01] <blackkanye> Reggie is week to white damage. Gonna panic in a second
[1:11:11] <JdotSweapA> to capcom it was just a product. like sfv now
[1:11:15] <dds333a> @nicversus dude, you're telling me
[1:11:22] <+thedream_c> yeah Ingrid def feels like an Ono creation
[1:11:36] <%ggbhtg> @MrGooseberryVT and Mignon Beret or whoever from Max Impact 2
[1:11:42] <+thedream_c> as she was only highlighted as Ono's influence grew withint he company
[1:11:44] <leith_aziz> ?
[1:11:47] <leith_aziz> WTF........
[1:11:49] <Solidnick18> wtf is that

[1:12:02] <Zero_Fayth> ‚ÄúCome on, baby..!‚Äù
[1:12:04] <Super_Voltekka> They removed Jedah's boob inflation move
[1:12:06] <nicversus> Hydron't act like y'all don't know
[1:12:07] <JdotSweapA> So heres a giant enemy crab
[1:12:07] <DomonTrigger> Does he have Midnight Bliss
[1:12:15] <oni_exe> I've seen enough content to know where this is going
[1:12:23] <+Xero_J> ...I beg your pardon, where did squid man come from?
[1:12:27] <mr_sups> Ou, la la
[1:12:30] <leith_aziz> Red Earth

[1:12:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:12:38] <+thedream_c> even noobs should know the raging demon input :)
[1:12:40] <%Grimlockfly> plenty of new Midnight Bliss sprites doe
[1:12:45] <%ThisIsLloyd> whats up with the cephalopod
[1:12:48] <deafmelone> Try like mashing dp with punches
[1:12:53] <Solidnick18> fried squid
[1:12:53] <Th3rd3> grill squid
[1:12:58] <dds333a> hydron is a boss from red earth
[1:13:02] <%ggbhtg> @thedream_c but IS that the input tho
[1:13:05] <%ThisIsLloyd> a h
[1:13:08] <pmda2126> what does the tiny squid do?
[1:13:09] <+BuckizcoBeet> To think that Demitri shares the same voice as Link...
[1:13:11] <+lumporr> ROUND START: JUMP IN!
[1:13:14] <anarchistPastry> so Hydron is from Red Earth, but Pyron is from Darkstalkers.... Kappa
[1:13:26] <Evendrag> CVS had the coolest sakura by far
[1:13:28] <JdotSweapA> knee press nightmare~
[1:13:29] <Evendrag> she sounds sick
[1:13:30] <leith_aziz> I'll give the game one credit. The hit impact
[1:13:50] <DomonTrigger> The hit noises are fun but so many animations got the weight sucked out of them
[1:13:53] <%ggbhtg> @leith_aziz ripped from CvS, tbh
[1:13:54] <KaiserMario> That's a super from the SF EX series, it's super cool
[1:13:57] <+Xero_J> I just noticed Sagat and Adon chilling in the background
[1:14:01] <+MrGooseberryVT> cool bison super
[1:14:09] <+lumporr> oh there's a dinosaur
[1:14:13] <+MrGooseberryVT> Imagine if they threw rival schools in but kept the 3d models
[1:14:14] <+thedream_c> more ShinAkuma666
[1:14:15] <leith_aziz> @ggbhtg Oh I know (kinda). So its not even original
[1:14:16] <Th3rd3> Sagat standing there thinking "Thanks god I'm not part of this weird thing"
[1:14:22] <nicversus> Shin Akuma? Where's Metsu Akuma?
[1:14:24] <Evendrag> and what the fuck is a warzard
[1:14:27] <+thedream_c> @MrGooseberryVT they didn't wanna go full mugen there
[1:14:30] <%Jiggisnipe> @MrGooseberryVT they should have
[1:14:31] <Solidnick18> oh anakaris
[1:14:33] <+thedream_c> and this game is already in big mugen territory
[1:14:41] <+MrGooseberryVT> Just go hog-wild full mugen
[1:14:42] <+thedream_c> fax. SFV Karin is her own char
[1:14:44] <jinjun1738> This music mind numbing

[1:14:49] <JdotSweapA> hi oro..
[1:14:50] <anarchistPastry> @nicversus LUL
[1:14:54] <+thedream_c> SFV Karin is get into VT to get into her fun shit
[1:15:03] <Ragezorx> 15 fps oro
[1:15:11] <Evendrag> and her vtrigger doesnt even last that long
[1:15:12] <Super_Voltekka> The curiously attractive fishman is swimming in the water
[1:15:14] <+thedream_c> ewww that 3fps Oro
[1:15:14] <+MrBreckenridge> Karin in sf alpha 3 is a beast

[1:15:31] <KaiserMario> @thedream_c I think you mean, "SFV is get into VT to get fun shit"
[1:15:47] <prime_name> Would it be accurate to say that BBCTB is what this game was trying to be?
[1:15:47] <+thedream_c> @KaiserMario damn. U gotta do Ed players like that too huh? And they only press 4 buttons
[1:15:48] <nicversus> BREAKING: schoolgirl beaten to death in the dark by aging karate weirdo
[1:15:51] <Applecannon63> SFV Karin is just her Alpha ver limited by the SFV gimmick
[1:16:04] <dds333a> Oh man, love those sounds
[1:16:15] <+thedream_c> RIP mummy Sim
[1:16:21] <leith_aziz> @KaiserMario: To be fair, the game can give you access to fun shit, which is more that can be said than MK11 in general
[1:16:23] <Super_Voltekka> Anakaris doesn't have the backdash so he's totally worthless
[1:16:24] <nicversus> You can see Oro's sack in this game
[1:16:32] <JdotSweapA> 160p
[1:16:34] <dds333a> Shin shoryuken'd
[1:16:34] <TheKazuma410> Nah that's 240p
[1:16:42] <TheKazuma410> Or yeah 160
[1:16:53] <%ggbhtg> Ingrid mirror, then throw this game in the furnace
[1:16:53] <Klefth> This character select theme is horrible :|
[1:17:10] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Ingrid's what happens when you hit the upgrade button, and then you immediately hit the "Fuck, Go back" button
[1:17:11] <nicversus> It's fire guile
[1:17:16] <%Jiggisnipe> it's Fei Long
[1:17:16] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz truly 2010's fg design. Teach noobs that the fun is in footsies/neutral and u truly get really fun when u save up resources.
[1:17:16] <+lumporr> mother fuck that makes me think my phone is vibrating
[1:17:24] <JdotSweapA> is that frigin Fei Long in the back?
[1:17:24] <mr_sups> Same!
[1:17:25] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:17:30] <+thedream_c> Fishboat Fei :p

[1:17:33] <+Mordexai0> Play Alpha 3 Max YOU COWARDS
[1:17:38] <Heefnoff> Why does his attack sound like a phone is vibriting
[1:17:40] <dds333a> Almost into everything
[1:17:42] <Heefnoff> vibrating
[1:17:42] <%guyalex> oh god I actually thought that was someone's phone earlier, buzzing on a hard surface haha
[1:17:43] <+thedream_c> wow this bg is depressing
[1:17:46] <Super_Voltekka> Fei Long Lei Lei and Yang make cameos
[1:17:50] <+thedream_c> Hsien Ko lounging
[1:17:55] <deafmelone> @applecannon63 Yeah
[1:17:55] <Gatolatte_PaPoPe> not atena
[1:17:56] <+Xero_J> Hsien-Ko in the background is a mood
[1:17:57] <+lumporr> it's so the opponent checks their phone during the match
[1:18:06] <+lumporr> wow but for real every time\
[1:18:11] <Klefth> That teleport sound effect is vile
[1:18:11] <+Mordexai0> @applecannon63 Yes. She is actually pretty funny in that game as someone who has played PXZ2
[1:18:14] <JdotSweapA> they ripped the background sprite of Tsien-ko in cvs2 and pasted it here..
[1:18:15] <Th3rd3> Fei Long, where are you going?
[1:18:17] <%Jiggisnipe> that really is a vibrate sound LUL
[1:18:17] <KaiserMario> Oh Woolie picked up that Gill alt costume
[1:18:18] <Heefnoff> That really sounds like a phone vibrating when he teleports lol
[1:18:18] <leith_aziz> @thedream_c I don't know if thats a positive. At least Strive is very fun even BEFORE you use RC. Its been a ride so far
[1:18:24] <prime_name> Is that Fei long's alpha art in the background?
[1:18:24] <%ggbhtg> YEETED
[1:18:27] <JdotSweapA> Yangs face looks like mud

[1:19:16] <Applecannon63> Man Feilong should come back in the next SF
[1:19:21] <+Xero_J> "I have a big head and little arms, I'm just not sure how well this plan was thought through."
[1:19:22] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz StrIVe  is def a different approach despite trying to be 'simpler'.

[1:19:51] <%ggbhtg> Ingrid was devoured by a T-Rex, AND ALL WAS GOOD
[1:19:56] <%krispen_wa> is this mugen?
[1:19:57] <leith_aziz> @thedream_c: And thank goodness for that.
[1:19:59] <DDDorsett> Y'all playing the BAD Capcom vs game  lytWINCE lytWINCE lytWINCE
[1:20:00] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> hoo boy
[1:20:02] <%Axle13j> Jedah's ending is the fuckin best
[1:20:02] <Solidnick18> sure
[1:20:03] <DaKnightWarrior> YEYEYE
[1:20:04] <prime_name> YES
[1:20:04] <Super_Voltekka> Hauzer is supposed to walk towards the corpse, then stomp on you
[1:20:08] <%ggbhtg> Check out some Midnight Blisses too? @WoolieVersus
[1:20:08] <PKSomething> I've never played or seen this game, who is ingrid and why does everyone hate her?
[1:20:09] <dds333a> Hoimei and Shaomei, I think
[1:20:14] <+thedream_c> lmaoo what did they NOT do
[1:20:16] <+Mordexai0> This game is good SHUT UP
[1:20:18] <cj_art> you should show off those midnight bliss sprites
[1:20:19] <pixel_river> LUL
[1:20:20] <vodska> a proper art direction wouldve done a lot for this game
[1:20:20] <SableS139a> The missing frames still hurt me
[1:20:22] <DomonTrigger> I only know the Jedah one that gets a callback in MvCI story mode
[1:20:26] <GothicLolitaAngel> I don‚Äôt hate her I love her design @pksomething
[1:20:29] <+thedream_c> lmao the game is good. meanwhile people gon dismiss NGBC
[1:20:33] <+Mordexai0> zyzxLmao zyzxLmao
[1:20:36] <%ggbhtg> Check out some Midnight Blisses too tho?? @WoolieVersus
[1:20:40] <Ragezorx> @PKSomething most of the hate is because she comes from a failed game, the rest of it is because shes anime and SF fans are insecure
[1:20:42] <deafmelone> @woolieversus can we some stuff midnight bliss and pharaoh curse stuff?
[1:20:48] <PKSomething> @GothicLolitaAngel all I know is people see her and go OH GOD NO
[1:20:50] <leith_aziz> My biggest issue of this game from what i've seen is that it just feels like a MUGEN
[1:20:51] <+thedream_c> MVC2 may look bad, but it def don't look THAT stiff
[1:20:57] <PKSomething> @Ragezorx Ah, ok, I see
[1:20:57] <DDDorsett> This game isn't good LUL
[1:21:01] <+eanscrale> So this is just Guilty Gear Isuka.
[1:21:06] <+thedream_c> and MVC2 has times where it def looks like a Mugen game
[1:21:08] <PKSomething> thank you
[1:21:11] <Applecannon63> Ingrid feels out of place
[1:21:14] <dds333a> And they are nothing like they are in those in this
[1:21:14] <SableS139a> Ingrid's not that bad if you turn to PXZ2. For everything else though, after her original title fell through, everything went downhill outside of maybe Alpha 3 Double Upper.
[1:21:16] <Ragezorx> they dont like a little girl beating their ryus and sagats
[1:21:16] <diontmack> lol my first exposure to ingrid was PxZ2
[1:21:18] <leith_aziz> I just wish new moves were at least added to make it feel different
[1:21:24] <brunoberserk> you dont understand ... but you brain does dnoSMUG
[1:21:31] <aura_00> @Ragezorx so why don't the hate Sakura?
[1:21:34] <dds333a> They feel incomplete
[1:21:43] <oni_exe> in short: THIS IS NOT MY ALEX
[1:21:47] <%zanzibar_junker> Are you guys gonna play something else?
[1:21:49] <Ragezorx> @aura_00 good question, make sure to ask that to ingrid haters
[1:21:51] <leith_aziz> New moves can change perspective in a good awy, but they dont even get that
[1:21:53] <Klefth> It's like being served veggie loaf and them telling you it's steak
[1:21:54] <%ggbhtg> What is Pharaoh's Curse? @deafmelone
[1:21:55] <+thedream_c> as I wrote before, Alex players are masochists unless they played TvC alex
[1:21:58] <+Xero_J> I dig Ingrid's design and I liked her in SFA3 Max, at least
[1:22:04] <dds333a> Sure is
[1:22:07] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:22:09] <+Mordexai0> @diontmack She was fine in PXZ2
[1:22:11] <SableS139a> @diontmack Congrats my dude. You got the best interpretation of the character (and a legit good one too). PXZ does a lot of characters justice.
[1:22:27] <leith_aziz> Will Alex ever get buffed to top tier for once ?
[1:22:39] <+thedream_c> @leith_aziz nope but his most fun version is probably TvC
[1:22:40] <%ggbhtg> and some Pharaoh's Curses, apparently @WoolieVersus
[1:22:43] <leith_aziz> Give the man a break
[1:22:45] <%ggbhtg> whatever those are
[1:22:46] <VladDamien> It's the Batman and Robin of the Capcom games LUL
[1:22:47] <Ragezorx> oh another reason why people hate ingrid is because she appeared in SFA3 Max, saying that dictator's power was originally hers. that was wack.
[1:22:48] <+thedream_c> and watching Alex in TvC is pretty fun too
[1:22:51] <dds333a> Demitri has always been a creature of Supreme taste
[1:22:54] <DaKnightWarrior> Bad timeline.
[1:22:54] <%Jiggisnipe> it was probably bad too
[1:22:55] <JdotSweapA> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:22:59] <Applecannon63> @leith_aziz he did got buffed in 5 but fairly in B Tier
[1:23:00] <%saladin1911> Wow, a bunch of people were all like, "Boo! Yuk! Ingrid is the worst." When asked why nobody has a reply LUL
[1:23:04] <DDDorsett> Capcom didd this while SNK did NGBC

[1:41:34] <%ggbhtg> Did Ono actually say "we already made a Capcom Vs already, so no dice"? I've heard it from Max multiple times over the years, so he probably had inside info on it. @WoolieVersus
[1:41:38] <feralknights> @brunoberserk i love that game unironically because i've played that whole compendium of games LOL
[1:41:44] <brunoberserk> BIOFREAKS ?

[1:42:01] <balthazar758> what is this lol
[1:42:01] <Applecannon63> @678saintglock If it was based on 8-ing's I'd be hype
[1:42:09] <%ggbhtg> 8-ing made it too
[1:42:10] <+thedream_c> it already exists
[1:42:11] <+Mordexai0> @woolieversus Have you ever thought to play Sonic Battle on the channel? You mentioned Handheld games before and I thought that was a good game.
[1:42:11] <leith_aziz> I remember my pal playing MVC2 when I was young. It'll be missed
[1:42:11] <+thedream_c> been existed
[1:42:14] <ManaSpurt> @Ragezorx Whya re you so upset over people not liking Ingrid? She's bad, thats just how life is.
[1:42:15] <+thedream_c> since PS2 days
[1:42:15] <Solidnick18> i only seen abit of it
[1:42:16] <+b_aleph> Do you think we'll get a P5A?
[1:42:17] <%concretenj> It's kusoge
[1:42:19] <Ragezorx> @ManaSpurt im still laughing HAHAHAHA
[1:42:22] <+CryptusMaximus> Y'all gonna play that Override 2?
[1:42:25] <%ggbhtg> 8-ing made a KR game for the Wii
[1:42:26] <%678saintglock> yeah there's plenty of kamen rider fighters but they suck
[1:42:28] <Applecannon63> 8-ing is good
[1:42:30] <snowmanie> Could use that ratio ruleset some online tourneys for MvC2 has been using
[1:42:31] <brunoberserk> PIT FIGHTER ?
[1:42:31] <Super_Voltekka> Did you know that Ingrid calls you a whippersnapper in some of her CFE win quotes? I'm not joking
[1:42:33] <Ragezorx> EleGiggle
[1:42:39] <+thedream_c> 8ing I give credit too
[1:42:42] <%678saintglock> oh shit i didn't catch that one tho
[1:42:50] <stephyesterday> yea climax scramble, it's uhhh. not the best but it's fun to press buttons with friends
[1:42:51] <sunnythedrunk> FeelsBadMan
[1:42:57] <leith_aziz> About ASW rollback, im fairly certain BBCF will be that game since the modders that ASW hired were already working on that
[1:42:58] <+tuchpi> Basement king LUL
[1:43:08] <alphalejandro> Woolie have Daigo fights
[1:43:11] <%Kriss1827> @WoolieVersus if Persona 5 Arena comes out should it be sprite art or 3d like strive?
[1:43:13] <dds333a> Reggie played Melee at some places, or whatever
[1:43:13] <Applecannon63> climax scramble is sadly meh
[1:43:14] <Ragezorx> @leith_aziz wait, arcsys hired the modders? source?
[1:43:16] <DaKnightWarrior> Almost took down Daigo tho Kappa
[1:43:18] <+PerfectDare> Basement King~
[1:43:19] <joshua_42> THE DAIGO FIGHT
[1:43:22] <%ChoculaUltra> LORE
[1:43:22] <brunoberserk> Reggie , the CHAMPION
[1:43:26] <%Lion_kun> But Woolie, you almost outfootsied Daigo
[1:43:26] <+tuchpi> @alphalejandro losing in pools isn't placing anything LUL
[1:43:30] <oni_exe> You guys should check out Rev 0, its a mod of Rev 2 that seems really cool
[1:43:36] <%Grimlockfly> Daigo was most hype
[1:43:38] <SubliminaIMessages> You managed to piss off Daigo tho LUL
[1:43:40] <+b_aleph> Wishlist for P5A? Let's talk about P5A!
[1:43:41] <leith_aziz> @Ragezorx They did! I dont have a source unfortunately. But you can just ask people
[1:43:45] <+thedream_c> @Kriss1827 IMO maybe 3d. Whatever is easier to create assets for andflip them
[1:43:47] <%ggbhtg> Did Ono actually say "we already made a Capcom Vs already, so no dice"? I've heard it from Max multiple times over the years, so he probably had inside info on it. @WoolieVersus
[1:43:52] <dds333a> Woolie is NO PRO
[1:43:53] <%ThatGuyThere03> ay but you played daigo tho
[1:43:56] <+thedream_c> lmaooo this show isn't about how to get to GFs indeed
[1:43:57] <%emperordread> I'm just shit stirrin <3
[1:44:01] <sunnythedrunk> Woolie did take games off Octo in Strive
[1:44:04] <Allenou> you need to understand that Woolie is not good at fighting games LUL
[1:44:04] <leith_aziz> I'll be fine with either artstyles for P5 Arena
[1:44:11] <+thedream_c> this is Saturday Morning Scrublords
[1:44:12] <Ragezorx> @leith_aziz if thats recent then thats good news for bbcf fans
[1:44:19] <SomersaultJustice> woolie is despair in that one smash video

[1:44:29] <%Lion_kun> Can we forget Kasumi ever existed and put Sophia instead?
[1:44:33] <+thedream_c> if you arelooking for ways to get to Grand Finals, u gotta do more soul searching than watching influencers :)
[1:44:38] <+GerryOmega> i want "play to learn" tatted
[1:44:40] <%ggbhtg> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN
[1:44:41] <Murdercles> i think they just meant matches won in tourney, not winning a tourney
[1:44:43] <Applecannon63> Honestly Winning is overrated
[1:44:45] <+Mcmoblin> Not just win a tournament but to win and top 8 consistently? You are a legend
[1:45:01] <+PerfectDare> Turns out Woolie secretly the best in the world... at a game he hasn't played yet.
[1:45:15] <balthazar758> woolie fights for fun. and salt.
[1:45:17] <leith_aziz> @Ragezorx They were hired the moment ASW helped with the mode and made it an official patch (+R) The modders were already working on BBCF so now it should only be easier
[1:45:19] <Allenou> Wins are temporary, fun is eternal
[1:45:31] <Ragezorx> oh i see
[1:45:31] <+lumporr> what the fuck

[1:46:33] <+someyounguy1> was that lee from tekken?
[1:46:35] <leith_aziz> @geistuser There's the old Guilty Gears. Xrd Rev 2 is the closest, but it doesnt use Rollback. +R does, but I would recommend you just wait for Strive
[1:46:35] <SomersaultJustice> heyyyy it' lee
[1:46:38] <357Sneak> SourPls
[1:46:38] <+thedream_c> WONG FEI HUNG

[1:47:25] <+PerfectDare> This game is really a hidden gem.
[1:47:27] <blackkanye> Yo the sprite work is nice
[1:47:27] <+thedream_c> IGS used their own specific chipset
[1:47:34] <nicversus> The IGS is like a higher powered Neo Geo
[1:47:35] <%ggbhtg> @Thunderhog just like my Chinese anime Kappa
[1:47:36] <+thedream_c> but what they accompolished with it with this game is SOMETHING else
[1:47:39] <+duskrush> Her arms are reminding me of Kung Pow when he pretends he's a bird
[1:47:45] <HelluvaNohbody> Why the animation so fluid
[1:47:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:49:13] <+DaBigVitus> my god it's beautiful
[1:49:16] <deafmelone> Good shit, I popped off when I saw it for the first time
[1:49:16] <Super_Voltekka> Martial Masters and Dong Dong are two of the best Chinese video games ever made period
[1:49:21] <Arek_1> Either A B C D one row or
[1:49:28] <Arek_1> A C B D
[1:49:39] <%ggbhtg> LIGHT PUNCH sajamInfinite
[1:49:39] <%ChoculaUltra> the human race took the 2d sprite era for granted dammit FeelsBadMan
[1:49:45] <Arek_1> Damn, A C top row, B D bottom row.
[1:49:52] <+PerfectDare> Oh snap, it's Shun Di
[1:50:09] <+thedream_c> China made another one which was like a USF4 rip off but its hilarious as it has various different engines in game
[1:50:10] <%ggbhtg> @ChoculaUltra Blame the CGI beasts
[1:50:33] <stephyesterday> these animations are INSANE
[1:50:33] <+Mordexai0> @thedream_c Wait, what game?
[1:50:49] <dds333a> Yeah, kinda
[1:50:53] <+thedream_c> @Mordexai0 something 3 kingdoms related. I forgot the full name.
[1:50:54] <leith_aziz> I mean 3D was ground breaking, but we should have still left a spot for 2D games as well in the industry
[1:51:02] <%ggbhtg> it ain't
[1:51:05] <%TopTieramisu> thirst
[1:51:06] <+GalacticaPhanto> yooo this looks so smooth

[1:51:17] <alphalejandro> El escorpion
[1:51:18] <+someyounguy1> literally zafina has that same stance
[1:51:18] <ManaSpurt> The animations in this game. Cray-Zee!
[1:51:20] <Arek_1> Since B+C is commonly used here, maybe A B C D one row would be more comfortable.
[1:51:22] <+Mcmoblin> Zafina could never
[1:51:25] <oni_exe> why does this game look so COOL?!?
[1:51:26] <leith_aziz> Oh. Zafina uses those styles
[1:51:28] <+Xero_J> If Skullgirls is any indication, 2D ain't done just yet
[1:51:30] <+GalacticaPhanto> what happened to IGS? I'm guessing this was expensive to make for arcade cabs?
[1:51:32] <Applecannon63> Straight up a scorpion
[1:51:37] <oni_exe> AND WHY AM I LEARNING ABT IT NOW??
[1:51:37] <Gatolatte_PaPoPe> ive seen scorpion on mugen

[1:51:44] <%ggbhtg> @Mcmoblin she literally has a Scorpion stance, wym?
[1:51:46] <Super_Voltekka> The final boss of the game is literally called White Lotus
[1:51:52] <+Mordexai0> @galacticaphanto they made Spectral vs Generation

[1:55:02] <+thedream_c> I believe this game came out around late 90s or early 2000s?
[1:55:02] <Thunderhog> No one is safe from THE POT
[1:55:03] <%saladin1911> It's slightly too quiet still tbf

[1:58:11] <leith_aziz> Sun Wokung type kid
[1:58:12] <nicversus> Scorpion (but not THAT scorpion)
[1:58:14] <+thedream_c> this game is normally 1v1

[1:58:32] <+thedream_c> its kinda like those old games that offered 1v1 but gave you a 3v3 or multi team option
[1:58:33] <leith_aziz> I think its written as "Son Wukong" ?
[1:58:34] <%ggbhtg> Maximum monke
[1:58:37] <Super_Voltekka> Fun Fact: There's a legit naked boob in Scorpion's ending

[1:59:24] <%ggbhtg> I member
[1:59:27] <ManaSpurt> Terry killed that thing.

[2:09:01] <+Reverend_Roscoe> RESPECTABO
[2:09:04] <DaKnightWarrior> This games so cool.

[2:09:21] <+thedream_c> the knockdown is still there. Get dat OKI
[2:09:26] <goztboy> that throw feels disrespectful lol
[2:09:28] <$Dungeon00X> Ah, Nasty Badger style
[2:09:45] <dds333a> @kewpaarts it's a real practical throw too
[2:09:46] <+thedream_c> i wonder if Drunken Masters hitbox adjusts in his idle animation

[2:10:05] <yuribo26> Is this a street fighter 3 bootleg?
[2:10:12] <+thedream_c> i forgot the last time I've seen played in an offline tourney
[2:10:15] <+thedream_c> was it Combo Breaker?
[2:10:21] <+Renkaru> this game is so sick
[2:10:26] <Applecannon63> @yuribo26 it is a far from that
[2:10:37] <yuribo26> @Applecannon63 I'm so confused
[2:10:39] <$Dungeon00X> This should be at EVO, damn.
[2:10:45] <+thedream_c> cuz Combo Breaker will play/stream some lil known FGs as long as there is a community for it
[2:10:52] <+Renkaru> its wushu 3rd strike
[2:11:02] <Applecannon63> it is more like Snk
[2:11:05] <JdotSweapA> Scorpion style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon When it's properly used it is almost invincible~
[2:11:06] <+thedream_c> nah even ANIMEVO never touched this
[2:11:23] <+thedream_c> and ANIMEVO was a big community at EVO who did side game tourneys
[2:11:38] <+thedream_c> oh yeah thats nasty
[2:11:43] <+thedream_c> send out a moving shadow
[2:11:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> reinstalling fightcade now lul
[2:11:58] <%ggbhtg> I mean, I could
[2:11:59] <dds333a> Martial Masters has a fair amount of knowledge, but yeah, it's virtually unknown
[2:12:00] <+thedream_c> FC2
[2:12:12] <DaKnightWarrior> Ready to see some killers.
[2:12:16] <+thedream_c> yeah it has a base knowledge board if you look around
[2:12:16] <+Renkaru> the sprite work is really nice
[2:12:25] <+thedream_c> i think JWONG played this game on stream awhile back too
[2:12:31] <+thedream_c> like 2 years ago or something
[2:12:41] <dds333a> I wish I was at home right about now.
[2:12:46] <%ggbhtg> did you mean, a couple months ago? @thedream_c
[2:12:49] <%ggbhtg> cuz it was
[2:12:52] <GarbageNirvana> Folks really gotta get out of the mindset that Chinese = knockoff
[2:12:53] <+thedream_c> maybe it was a couple months
[2:13:03] <+thedream_c> it maybe be a knockoff, but don't knock the effort
[2:13:14] <+thedream_c> this is HIGH tier effort for a animtions in an FG
[2:13:15] <jactuscack83> lol I actually saw this game in Taiwan in arcades in the early 2000s
[2:13:15] <dds333a> Oh well, not like I'm particularly all that good anyway, KEKW
[2:13:20] <Super_Voltekka> You can pick the same character in the same team? WutFace
[2:13:22] <+cloudman_exe> I'm late as hell but goddamn this game has amazing sprites
[2:13:25] <+Renkaru> itsn ot really a knockoff its pretty unique
[2:13:35] <+thedream_c> yeah the team fight version is not robust. Its a 1v1 fighter at the end
[2:13:46] <+cloudman_exe> I wouldn't be surprised if 3rd Strike animators we're behind this.
[2:13:53] <+thedream_c> nah defnot 3S animators
[2:13:58] <+thedream_c> IGS def got their own talents
[2:14:06] <+thedream_c> peep some of their other high effort titles
[2:14:22] <+thedream_c> wow the cheeks peekin
[2:14:36] <dds333a> Like I said, spicy Reggie out here
[2:14:39] <%ggbhtg> midler
[2:14:42] <deafmelone> IGS made the killing blade right?
[2:14:42] <@Solidus_113> MIdler
[2:14:44] <+thedream_c> oooh red snake got a sneaky backdash strike move
[2:14:44] <CalderGaming> "red snake! red snake!" reggie insists as he slowly shrinks and turns into a corn cob
[2:14:46] <anarchistPastry> Midler
[2:14:46] <%ggbhtg> I thought so too
[2:14:47] <yuribo26> @GarbageNirvana I'm not saying that its a knockoff because its chinese, just because it REALLY looks like 3rd strike
[2:15:03] <+thedream_c> lookslike 3s? Makes me think more like Garou
[2:15:07] <+thedream_c> with pixel detail
[2:15:10] <alphalejandro> But Jojo Heritage Midler
[2:15:13] <+thedream_c> 3S got the rotoscope deal goin
[2:15:13] <stonestring93> is this snk?
[2:15:21] <+thedream_c> IGS own hardware
[2:15:23] <dds333a> Just kinda in aesthetics, especially since Midler didn't have anything but a dress in the manga
[2:15:31] <+thedream_c> but someone did say IGS hardware is like amped up neo geo
[2:15:36] <yuribo26> Watermelon tech PogChamp
[2:15:43] <yuribo26> Pineappel?
[2:15:46] <GarbageNirvana> And Fatal Fury looked like SFII but it clearly wasn't
[2:15:48] <+loukemia83> the damage on that Watermelon was HUGE
[2:15:48] <Super_Voltekka> Someone tell them about the secret characters
[2:15:50] <+Mordexai0> You guys should unlock Saojin
[2:15:56] <pmda2126> I've never heard of it until today
[2:15:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:58] <+thedream_c> never took off? I mean its hard to promote own IPs even back then too
[2:16:00] <jactuscack83> Saojin and True Lotus Master
[2:16:07] <Murdercles> can you fix the framing so we can see the player names?
[2:16:09] <DaKnightWarrior> When did this game come out?
[2:16:14] <dds333a> As DP would say, Pineapple Surprise
[2:16:18] <tacostarvedbeast> was this game after third strike? feeling like someone took shaun's gimmick and expanded on it
[2:16:21] <jactuscack83> 99, in Taiwan
[2:16:22] <ainda_> its for the developers propritary hardware which was only really popular in Taiwan iirc
[2:16:31] <+thedream_c> oh operation scorpio
[2:16:40] <%678saintglock> yeah i definitely need to hop on here and press buttons
[2:16:42] <dds333a> '99
[2:16:43] <GarbageNirvana> This was around the same time as 3S
[2:16:54] <+thedream_c> oh Operation Scorpio be that movie
[2:17:01] <Super_Voltekka> They also made some really great beatemups too
[2:17:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reika is kinda smug
[2:17:07] <XfourtwoX> The studio behind this game usec tgo do great pixel art, today they make mosou mmo for the asian market FailFish
[2:17:11] <balthazar758> this company also made a metal slug clone called "demon front". it's honestly impressive how similar it was.
[2:17:13] <+thedream_c> xie xie
[2:17:14] <puluxor> Seriously, this is going right in my "cool fighting games that I'll never play because I can't even master the ones I'm already on" pile tyrantPain
[2:17:17] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus player names are cut off a smidge
[2:17:23] <dds333a> Some really fun beat em ups, none of which i have beaten
[2:17:32] <jactuscack83> mei guanxi
[2:17:34] <+thedream_c> oooh spectral vs generation is a PSP one too
[2:17:47] <deafmelone> That‚Äôs really cool
[2:17:54] <+thedream_c> eyah IGS made their money off that duanyst warriors style beat em up
[2:17:57] <@akuda_bar> stupid finnicky streaming software
[2:17:58] <theyblamedthebeasts> I love how uninterested some of the background characters are.
[2:17:58] <+FuqBoiSlim> @xfourtwox seeing good studios getting sent into mobile or MMO hell is a special type of sad
[2:18:00] <+thedream_c> Legends of Valor
[2:18:07] <Murdercles> ABG in the house LUL
[2:18:09] <+cloudman_exe> I can already see this game being remade with a cool, lo-fi hiphop aesthetic
[2:18:15] <+thedream_c> one of the Legens of Valour is pretty tight tho. I play it on my emus.
[2:18:17] <Arek_1> This game's resolution is 448x224. Nice. That means that they squeeze in extra detail horizontally and then correct for aspect ratio. Just like Capcom fighters.
[2:18:38] <+thedream_c> yeah these taiwan devs knew the curve
[2:18:43] <dds333a> everywhere else in 0
[2:19:02] <anarchistPastry> yo we switched languages?
[2:19:04] <dds333a> *01,yeah in US
[2:19:13] <+thedream_c> IGS hardware probably was expensive too ship out too
[2:19:19] <Super_Voltekka> Spooky should stream this
[2:19:21] <nicversus> Everything on the IGS is relatively obscure
[2:19:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah that sounds early 2000s/late 90s
[2:19:27] <+thedream_c> remember how South America got less capcom hardware but more bootleg SNK hardware? ALl logistics and economics
[2:19:31] <theyblamedthebeasts> is this the same drunken master guy who appears in the GIFG intro?
[2:19:38] <%678saintglock> yep
[2:19:39] <nicversus> Demon Front, which is basically just a bootleg Metal Slug is also pretty rad
[2:19:39] <+thedream_c> so IGS hardware stuff only really moved around Asia
[2:19:56] <+thedream_c> yeah Demon Front is VERY well done for a MS rip off
[2:20:12] <+thedream_c> yeee shadow moves be nutty in this game
[2:20:35] <%678saintglock> how do you do shadow moves again
[2:20:36] <puluxor> Sick animation
[2:20:46] <nicversus> yeah calling it a metal slug bootleg is a bit reductive on my part, there's a lot of unique ideas. It does steal some visual design from wargraft a little bit but honestly it's pretty unique
[2:20:48] <+thedream_c> monkey faust huh
[2:20:49] <yuribo26> Those animations are really cool
[2:20:50] <KUYAmoPESh> Duuurian!
[2:20:55] <nicversus> *warcraft
[2:20:55] <Murdercles> @678saintglock qcf or qcb and BC
[2:20:59] <jactuscack83> durians in there
[2:21:02] <+thedream_c> HAHAHA
[2:21:04] <+thedream_c> OHs
[2:21:11] <+thedream_c> htrow fruit, do overheads
[2:21:18] <+thedream_c> give zero fux
[2:21:20] <XfourtwoX> DURIAN PROJECTILES!!!! WutFace
[2:21:24] <SomersaultJustice> bonk
[2:21:28] <jactuscack83> projectile druians
[2:21:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> That apple chipped her out.
[2:21:32] <nicversus> Fruity KO
[2:21:34] <+thedream_c> oooh chip damage
[2:21:35] <+thedream_c> hold dat
[2:21:43] <nicversus> Fruit Fighter
[2:21:50] <+loukemia83> This is really cool, but 1v1 or tagging in would be better
[2:21:56] <Meltgar> So this is a "hidden" fighting game?
[2:21:58] <dds333a> Melon Masters
[2:22:05] <+thedream_c> yeah horizontal shadow moves look nice for extenders. But the real nasty one is shit that covers space
[2:22:08] <Meltgar> Banana slammers the arcade game Kappa
[2:22:13] <+thedream_c> LMAOO crossup?
[2:22:14] <jactuscack83> get a jackfruit in there
[2:22:19] <deafmelone> There is 1v1 mode, that‚Äôs what it is normally
[2:22:26] <+thedream_c> yeah this is a 1v1 game normally
[2:22:35] <+thedream_c> but as I wrote games back then would offer team battle modes
[2:22:37] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> HOLD THAT SHIT
[2:22:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:22:41] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:22:42] <dds333a> @meltgar it's a legit fighting game
[2:22:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:22:45] <oni_exe> LUL
[2:22:47] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> <3
[2:22:48] <+FuqBoiSlim> monkey boy got the gon freecs shape up I'm realizing
[2:22:57] <oni_exe> yo is there a tierlist for this game?
[2:22:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:23:09] <Meltgar> @dds333a Oh i meant by, those games that get overshadowed by KoF, SF in their time, thanks for info tho!
[2:23:13] <Arek_1> INodWhenILose. LUL
[2:23:29] <+PerfectDare> Yo, did you unlock true lotus master?
[2:23:38] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus top of the screen is cropped off
[2:23:44] <jactuscack83> you need True Lotus
[2:23:45] <dds333a> @meltgar Oh, I gotcha, like "obscure". yeah, it's mostly unknown.
[2:23:59] <dds333a> It has a player base, but it's rather small
[2:24:03] <DSD24> I like Scorpions oufit
[2:24:22] <+thedream_c> its inspired from a movie
[2:24:22] <+loukemia83> imagine you're about to get in a street fight with a dude and he starts crawling around like this guy
[2:24:32] <+thedream_c> this game is a homage to kung fu films of old
[2:24:41] <+thedream_c> so if you area watcher, these references be hittin
[2:24:45] <nicversus> Drunken Ghost attack
[2:24:50] <oni_exe> @loukemia83 LUL
[2:24:57] <dds333a> @thedream_c Yessir
[2:25:01] <XfourtwoX> @dds333a game is broken with tons of easy infinite combos, there was a update version but is still broken sadly
[2:25:15] <KUYAmoPESh> That un holy amount of alcohol consumption. lul
[2:25:18] <+thedream_c> yeah this game is fleshed out but balance wise, forget it
[2:25:25] <jactuscack83> Scott Hall consumes more
[2:25:30] <+thedream_c> still game looks fun for wht it is
[2:25:45] <GarbageNirvana> Why don't we have more games about kung fu anyway?
[2:25:48] <nicversus> looka t this jojo stand
[2:25:49] <DSD24> Wow is Lotus Master the final boss?
[2:25:53] <pmda2126> heroes of wrestling amount of alcohol
[2:25:57] <+thedream_c> back in the old days when hardware was outand its hard to make balancing unless its another iteration
[2:25:57] <jactuscack83> True Lotus Master is the fi nal boss
[2:26:09] <+PerfectDare> no @DSD24, True lotus master is final
[2:26:13] <DaKnightWarrior> That SNK super!
[2:26:22] <DSD24> @GarbageNirvana We do got that New Kung Fu game from Slocap called Sifu on the horizon
[2:26:38] <Meltgar> NOICE
[2:26:41] <dds333a> @garbagenirvana there are some that are trash
[2:26:44] <+thedream_c> yeahthere is also thatshaolin vs wutang game. But this game does it so much better.
[2:26:53] <+panlakes> Is there a drunken master character in this?
[2:26:59] <+thedream_c> but of course
[2:27:03] <DSD24> Ooo Red Snake looks cool
[2:27:06] <dds333a> @panlakes you just missed him
[2:27:08] <Meltgar> @panlakes You missed him in the 1st match, old man fighter
[2:27:12] <+panlakes> dangit
[2:27:14] <+FuqBoiSlim> nah this red snake color got me feeling strange
[2:27:23] <jactuscack83> a very drunk old man
[2:27:26] <+thedream_c> melanated Red Skin Kreygasm
[2:27:30] <+thedream_c> Snake I mean
[2:27:44] <alexsumac> This certainly is one of the best 2D fighting games, when it comes to animation. And I've never heard about this existence.
[2:28:00] <DSD24> Yeah she looks great
[2:28:04] <nicversus> hahaha thedream_c that coulda got you in trouble
[2:28:07] <+thedream_c> yeah I've only heard about this game like a decade ago
[2:28:17] <%678saintglock> that was so fun omg
[2:28:22] <DSD24> Sonic the Fighters?
[2:28:27] <+thedream_c> backwhen I was talking with others about underrated and obscure FGs
[2:28:27] <%ggbhtg> GBA game
[2:28:34] <fIashman92> GBA game
[2:28:35] <+cloudman_exe> Sonic Battle is a GBA game
[2:28:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> Sonic Battle isnt really a fighter, its a Powerstone at best
[2:28:40] <+thedream_c> Sega figthing all stars
[2:28:43] <dds333a> the one with Emerl
[2:28:43] <anarchistPastry> its a GBA sonic arena brawler, think Custom Robo
[2:28:43] <%LastHazzerd> sonic battle is like an arena brawler with cards
[2:28:45] <Thunderhog> It's not a traditional fighter. Sonic battle's a gba arena fighter
[2:28:49] <Blank9> sonic battle is cool
[2:28:50] <nicversus> Sonic the Fighters rules you take that back woolie
[2:28:58] <%LastHazzerd> we'd have to have a debate over if it's a fighter or not
[2:28:59] <dds333a> Or Gemerl, fuck, I forget
[2:29:01] <$Dungeon00X> Sonic Battle is so broken it's funny.
[2:29:08] <fIashman92> It's where half the Sonic Mugen sprites come from
[2:29:19] <+Mordexai0> @lasthazzerd The cards thing only applies to Emerl
[2:29:27] <dds333a> Sonic Battle is no good, but the sprites are sick
[2:29:31] <%LastHazzerd> wait, is Sonic an anime arena fighter?
[2:29:36] <nicversus> Thaaaat's no good
[2:29:39] <%ggbhtg> Is Sonic Battle good? I dunno. Should we look at it? Yes.
[2:29:45] <jactuscack83> True Lotus Master
[2:29:46] <%Sparkseid> Sparkseid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[2:29:47] <+thedream_c> saojin yeah
[2:29:47] <jactuscack83> you need him
[2:29:49] <+FuqBoiSlim> I remember Gamma being super busted in that game. idk if he actually was
[2:29:49] <GarbageNirvana> Was that the one with Blue Mary Sally
[2:29:53] <dds333a> He's here
[2:29:53] <XfourtwoX> she a joke character
[2:29:53] <+thedream_c> i forgot Saojins lore but she's a reporter or something
[2:29:54] <%ggbhtg> You already had SaoJin up there, I think

[2:31:21] <+Systmdfect> That special from Crane has some chip damage on it.
[2:31:22] <BUDderzIllA> they're practicing their shots on the background
[2:31:27] <dds333a> TESTIFY with these claws
[2:31:38] <+thedream_c> did TIGER just say moogoo gai pan?
[2:31:39] <jactuscack83> the power of Christ
[2:31:39] <+loukemia83> These British Colonial soldiers ready to put down some opium riots
[2:31:42] <+FuqBoiSlim> @floralkami never got a console port.
[2:31:50] <%TopTieramisu> chizuru vs cody
[2:31:52] <nicversus> look at that guy jerkin his musket
[2:32:01] <+thedream_c> yeah IGS focused more on their Legend of Valour title that ACTUALLY got ports in the future
[2:32:03] <nicversus> I guess it's a rifle but still
[2:32:06] <floralkami> @lasthazzerd he IS a christian preacher
[2:32:06] <jactuscack83> that guy certainly is cleaning his rifle
[2:32:09] <+thedream_c> so I guess Martial Masters def didn't hit financially
[2:32:13] <%TopTieramisu> TIGER CLOW
[2:32:24] <jactuscack83> can't stop cleaning his rifle back there
[2:32:24] <+thedream_c> AMEN

[2:32:38] <nicversus> what do you mean @thedream_c Marshall Mathers is a platinum selling rapper
[2:32:44] <dds333a> yeah, it's a roundhouse alright
[2:32:50] <DSD24> Berserker Barrage!
[2:32:52] <Super_Voltekka> You can tell he's not voiced by a real Westerner
[2:32:56] <weapon000> it Tiger like an English Missionary?
[2:33:01] <+thedream_c> yes he is
[2:33:02] <floralkami> @fuqboislim I know, but like... no one has talked about it --well come to think of it, this may be the first time she's been shown on a prominent show.
[2:33:09] <+thedream_c> spreading the good of Gawd in a foreign land
[2:33:13] <snowmanie> can't let any foreigners into the British zone
[2:33:25] <floralkami> I don't remember James Chen unlocking Saojin
[2:33:28] <jactuscack83> they are having crumpets
[2:33:36] <+thedream_c> SToner Scorpion
[2:33:40] <dds333a> He was doing it, yeah
[2:33:41] <ainda_> i like that the british level is imperialsm and racism + some poor guy begging a rich guy for something and him saying no
[2:33:43] <DSD24> The Rock?
[2:34:09] <floralkami> @ainda_ ... yeah?
[2:34:13] <+thedream_c> FATALITY
[2:34:17] <%TopTieramisu> Home with you!
[2:34:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ggs wools
[2:34:22] <DSD24> I mean I can appreciate the Mom
[2:34:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> TBH, i was super winging it with Crane
[2:34:30] <DSD24> She was throwing hands
[2:34:32] <dds333a> She's a reporter, iirc
[2:34:32] <+loukemia83> don't pick sean unless you want to style on some fools
[2:34:32] <+thedream_c> Mom i think requires technique
[2:34:33] <floralkami> I want more mom
[2:34:38] <+FuqBoiSlim> Moms can have fun too
[2:34:50] <nicversus> I feel like this game wouldn't be all that well remembered even if it did live on through home ports
[2:34:52] <+thedream_c> yeah i thought the lore isthat she's a reporter
[2:34:52] <ainda_> @floralkami yeah historically accurate

[2:35:27] <+thedream_c> @nicversus true. But Idunno if IGS was about tha tlife until they had a game worth selling as a port
[2:35:27] <dds333a> They didn't notice before, KEKW
[2:35:33] <anarchistPastry> oh shit stage ROCKS
[2:35:33] <DSD24> Be your own team

[2:35:48] <+BarbosaEdit> get back to monke boy
[2:35:48] <floralkami> ... did y'all not realize the picker never switched off after picking a charter?
[2:35:53] <+thedream_c> nice contrast tot he color
[2:35:55] <dds333a> Woolie picked Drunken Master twice before
[2:35:57] <Arek_1> How do you setup dipswitches for matches? Is that allowed?
[2:35:57] <+vaporousTippler> For a second, I thought they were fighting in the zoo.
[2:36:01] <+thedream_c> RETURN 2 MONKE
[2:36:09] <+thedream_c> WOW what a punish
[2:36:09] <%TopTieramisu> chimichurri
[2:36:15] <jactuscack83> cufizn

[2:36:51] <nicversus> I really like this stage bg
[2:36:55] <+thedream_c> ooh crane got a karin low
[2:36:59] <nicversus> chupachuuuup
[2:37:05] <+thedream_c> does that knockdown tho
[2:37:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:37:13] <floralkami> does anyone else feel like this music would bang with just a little drum rework?
[2:37:17] <dds333a> Not all of them, anyway
[2:37:20] <+thedream_c> run up throw
[2:37:27] <alexsumac> There is a secret (joke?) character called Saojin.
[2:37:27] <nicversus> fighting game backgrounds are a lost art
[2:37:28] <ManaSpurt> @Boner_Girl It's more racist that that was the first thing your mind put together.
[2:37:28] <+thedream_c> that looks like some cheap throw bait
[2:37:33] <neraren> Jimmy Chooooos
[2:37:44] <jactuscack83> Durians!!
[2:37:53] <%TopTieramisu> CHIMICHUUU
[2:37:55] <floralkami> @boner_girl yeah, no... nice reach
[2:38:00] <dds333a> @nicversus you are so right, dude. Although there are still great ones today
[2:38:04] <pmda2126> fruit  zoning
[2:38:07] <+thedream_c> Crane got CHEEKS
[2:38:13] <nicversus> oh yeah there are still people keeping the art alive for sure
[2:38:29] <weapon000> break open the Durian for a poison dot  crendorSkittles
[2:38:33] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> monkey man does it all
[2:38:44] <DaKnightWarrior> Monkey boys good.
[2:38:59] <+FuqBoiSlim> imagine if watermelon set ups were real
[2:39:01] <+thedream_c> andthe whiff punish
[2:39:01] <floralkami> @manaspurt man, the more I think about it, the more I hate it LUL
[2:39:07] <%rasamune> Durians are tasty though
[2:39:11] <DSD24> I like Monkey Boy's running animation
[2:39:13] <MichaelOfCainhurst> monke
[2:39:16] <%ggbhtg> LUL ggs
[2:39:17] <ManaSpurt> @floralkami lmao I know right
[2:39:20] <+loukemia83> monke top tier
[2:39:21] <+SenorCounter> SNL Mango
[2:39:24] <Super_Voltekka> MonkiFlip
[2:39:24] <jactuscack83> Durian is the only move he calls by its name
[2:39:32] <+NopeBadguy> DURIAN
[2:39:41] <KUYAmoPESh> Knuckledu
[2:39:47] <balthazar758> monke rules
[2:39:55] <dds333a> well...
[2:39:58] <ManaSpurt> I feel like the Durian should add a debuff on it.
[2:40:14] <pmda2126> durian goes over
[2:40:19] <+BarbosaEdit> that was a JACA, not a durian
[2:40:21] <+thedream_c> ducklenu?
[2:40:28] <weapon000> @ManaSpurt like I said break it open for a poison dot
[2:40:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> haha game go brrrrr
[2:40:49] <+FuqBoiSlim> durian adds input lag to all your moves like that Valentine special
[2:40:56] <jactuscack83> Sexual Harassment..Panda
[2:40:58] <ManaSpurt> @ManaSpurt Yesss! Genius.
[2:41:15] <dds333a> I always thought it was kinda limiting
[2:41:25] <+thedream_c> its def toomuch conceptually since they never balanced around team mode
[2:41:28] <dds333a> But I like it still.
[2:41:41] <+thedream_c> remember old games did team battle mode despite balacning it around specifically for 1v1
[2:41:47] <+BarbosaEdit> no ratio system
[2:42:04] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> In a kof kinda way I still love this
[2:42:06] <nicversus> Is Nuckledu doing ok? He was in an accident awhile back right
[2:42:16] <+thedream_c> that accident was awhile back
[2:42:42] <nicversus> yeah I never really heard much after the initial thing
[2:43:00] <+thedream_c> i mean... check his twitter?
[2:43:02] <nicversus> I think the drunken master design is the best one in the game for sure
[2:43:05] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> yo the setup
[2:43:07] <snowmanie> MvC2 tourneys using a set ratio system for characters are pretty interesting
[2:43:33] <+thedream_c> the neutral
[2:43:40] <+thedream_c> HIDDEN fireballz
[2:43:41] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> LITTLE?
[2:43:46] <DaKnightWarrior> Ryu & Ken helping.
[2:43:50] <pmda2126> throws it before getting in the room
[2:43:51] <dds333a> Yep, they hitting too
