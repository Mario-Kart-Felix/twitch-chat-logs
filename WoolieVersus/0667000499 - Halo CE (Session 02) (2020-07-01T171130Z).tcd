[0:06:46] <%PadreHail> Not all of em but Halo 3 has a couple levels that are deadass A to B compared to the others in the same game
[0:06:49] <armchairmaster_> You forgot the cookies?!
[0:06:49] <+TheShisno> If any game has filler, it's 5
[0:06:49] <thesoldierofjoy> The Ark and The Covenant are some of the best Halo levels, dont change my mind.
[0:06:55] <BioticEmu> groose? this is the theme of Tetra's pirates in windwaker
[0:07:16] <armchairmaster_> @theshisno Halo 5 is the Dragonball GT of Halo; it doesn't matter.
[0:07:23] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> Halo 2 definitely has no filler
[0:07:34] <%Wouldz> username checks out

[0:07:40] <%Irridium> all the games have their ups and downs but at least we never get to the pure garbage that is The Library in any game after 1
[0:07:42] <%PadreHail> Halo 5 is more like the Dragon Ball Heroes woolieTRASH
[0:07:45] <%krispen_wa> the rumors that halo infinite is just gonna ignore halo 5 are funny as hell
[0:07:54] <%emperordread> I just heard Woolie on the podcast say "Muttz-ah-rhel" and I am upset
[0:07:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:56] <BioticEmu> was the library that bad?
[0:07:58] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> dats duh name
[0:08:15] <+JingKaisean> yeah but gabbagol
[0:08:15] <%Irridium> replayed it last week with a friend. the library is just awful
[0:08:19] <%PadreHail> The Library is fun but it's very much a shooting gallery
[0:08:32] <thesoldierofjoy> Halo 5 is the Dark Souls 2 of Halo. Good game; less than astounding Halo. Post-launch support was excellent though.
[0:08:33] <Ynkubus18> The Library is bad, just a nightmare to behold on legendary
[0:08:34] <%Irridium> literally the same two corridors stapled together for thirty minutes

[0:08:52] <%SableS139a> Honestly, The Library only seems fun in SPV3. Playing it otherwise solo is a trainwreck and a nightmare.

[0:09:03] <razieltano123> The Ark levels of Halo 3 has the best skyboxes in the series.
[0:09:05] <%Irridium> as you endlessly fight [REDACTED] while [REDACTED] just sings at you and laughs
[0:09:06] <%ringabal> Italian here. [MOOT=ZHA-DEL-LAH] is the pronunciation used.
[0:09:14] <%PadreHail> Halo 5 is the Lords of the Fallen of Halo
[0:09:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Thid MISTAPE IS FIRE
[0:09:19] <%SableS139a> @Irridium >feelsbadman
[0:09:21] <Solidnick18> i guess i made the right choice stopping at reach lol
[0:09:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Library sets the tone for how overwhelming of an infestation it is.
[0:09:30] <cipher758> ohh shittt. hello
[0:09:30] <%the1whoknocs> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[0:09:37] <%PadreHail> I shit on Halo 4 a lot but it's an alright game overall
[0:09:42] <andrex2311> made it in time!
[0:09:42] <%krispen_wa> Halo 5 is the Pacific Rim 2 of Halo
[0:09:42] <%lewdskeletor13> Time to finish this fight
[0:09:45] <%PadreHail> But it's a fucking mega corridor
[0:09:48] <OverlordLuna> More John Halos? PogChamp
[0:09:53] <armchairmaster_> @thesoldierofjoy except Dark Souls 2 is actually a good game at its' core, and Halo 5 is not.
[0:09:55] <time_axis> anyone know what this track is from?
[0:10:00] <+TheShisno> Infinite is 343's last chance
[0:10:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Halo 5 is the only Halo I don’t like, hoping Infinite will be better
[0:10:03] <andrei11dr> Ite very clear that Woolie has only played Symphony of The Night LUL
[0:10:05] <%PadreHail> Castlevania Symphony of the Night
[0:10:06] <MyNameIsRasus> Halo 5 is the Psycho Pass Season 2 of Halo
[0:10:10] <%PadreHail> Issa remix
[0:10:15] <mike0dude> happy canada day
[0:10:16] <%krispen_wa> Halo 5 is the Halo 5 of Halo
[0:10:21] <+TheShisno> ^
[0:10:32] <armchairmaster_> Halo 5 is the Got Season 8 of Halo.
[0:10:33] <time_axis> @PadreHail Thanks
[0:10:38] <%PadreHail> Halo Wars full lp
[0:10:43] <%PadreHail> Kappa
[0:10:47] <lewdskeletor13> I would be shocked if they don’t finish the game today
[0:10:51] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> Halo 4 is a great story and deserves that praise
[0:10:55] <mike0dude> finally an FPS woolie can play with a controller
[0:10:59] <%ringabal> Clearly, time travel will be involved
[0:10:59] <time_axis> @PadreHail I thought I heard it before, but it must have been here.
[0:11:00] <OldManDeckardCain> halo 5 was the lame people we met along the way
[0:11:02] <knackirontarkus> Halo 5 is the 3rd Birthday of Halo
[0:11:12] <razieltano123> Halo 5 was trying to be Star Wars Republic Commando and failed.
[0:11:12] <%lewdskeletor13> Didact was a cool villain, should’ve kept him for 6
[0:11:13] <%krispen_wa> Halo 4 deserves to exist simply because of thicc cortana
[0:11:16] <%lewdskeletor13> *5
[0:11:18] <%PadreHail> The story with the two main leads in 4 is pretty good but everything else about the story in 4 is atrocious
[0:11:19] <sage2001> what song is this
[0:11:21] <sniffy77> Reminder that the Didact got cucked by a 13 year old kid.
[0:11:23] <sage2001> !currentsong
[0:11:27] <armchairmaster_> Halo could have honestly ended at 4, and I'd be okay with it just for the Cortana story wrapping up.
[0:11:27] <%Irridium> Halo 4's story and what they tried to do was at least decent. A shame the levels just weren't very interesting to go through. And the multiplayer wasn't that great.
[0:11:30] <+yeeter_baelish> john halo PogChamp
[0:11:49] <+TheShisno> We will get into all that in due time
[0:11:53] <%lewdskeletor13> And his name... is John Halo
[0:11:55] <HeavyC4> what song is this chat?
[0:11:59] <+yeeter_baelish> forerunner designs are cool tho
[0:12:04] <%Theycallmenerf> Can we agree mommy cortana was the right direction for her design?
[0:12:10] <%krispen_wa> I just wish they didn't swerve in halo 4 and make the forerunner a separste race from humans
[0:12:11] <%PadreHail> It's from Symphony of the Night
[0:12:18] <%PadreHail> I forget the song name
[0:12:20] <armchairmaster_> Halo 5 is the Resident Evil: Gun Survivor of Halo.
[0:12:28] <DomunDomunDomun> Mommy cortana to make the oedipus complex more obvious.
[0:12:28] <%Asuterisuku> Oi no spoilers.
[0:12:29] <+TheShisno> I like Cortana's weird hard light "clothes"
[0:12:30] <eldragon_1> Which Halo are they on right now?
[0:12:32] <%lewdskeletor13> @krispen_wa That was already the case in 3

[0:27:52] <Solidnick18> almost like you need to avoid comments
[0:27:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Halsey isn’t mentioned or even seen till Reach
[0:27:55] <splitmilkttv> 5ish games and books will do that
[0:28:00] <Joestar1890> BIIG SPOILERS
[0:28:01] <StarlitStunner> lytBADMAN Lotus loves crime @d00msdaydan
[0:28:02] <stayinthepocket> Is it spoilers if Woolie has no context of reference?
[0:28:02] <cipher758> that side of the fanbase is annoying
[0:28:03] <andrex2311> Chill = None
[0:28:04] <+TheShisno> MISSION 1 HAS MID-GAME SPOILERS
[0:28:05] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean people shouldn't send Woolie spoilers, but guys are allowed to discuss stuff on the subreddit right?
[0:28:06] <Dean_Inbetween> WE TOO EXCITE
[0:28:06] <armchairmaster_> Woolie is gonna be hyped for Halo 1 Kappa
[0:28:06] <%Theycallmenerf> Real question, are we doing it chat? Are we doing it this session?
[0:28:08] <Ion_Laser> The terminals are BIG Spoilers
[0:28:10] <marvel877> Then stay off the subreddit.
[0:28:10] <taquito_blade> i can't wait til he meets "them"
[0:28:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dat 1st prequel book is great tho
[0:28:17] <derap41> The Sexual Energy between Cortana and John HALO
[0:28:19] <Mike_Mc> as long as you have played all the games and read all the books the terminals don't spoil anything /s
[0:28:23] <+TheShisno> Today will be fun
[0:28:24] <%dekkitout> Is the shock absorbing gel in the suits of armor spoils?
[0:28:27] <IntrepidEye> Halsey isn't relevant in the games until Reach
[0:28:28] <%Irridium> I read them!
[0:28:31] <%Tearonex> You're not getting there for while
[0:28:31] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> a lot of the good lore in halo isn't even in the game, it's in the books and stuff
[0:28:33] <+wunp_fxs> oh yeah iremember that
[0:28:33] <$jake5713> She da worst-ish.
[0:28:35] <FacetiousAF> das a good name for an armor tho
[0:28:36] <DigitalJoshie> even if they don't spoil, woolie doesn't have context for them. V's got this
[0:28:38] <+TheShisno> Yeah normies will kill themselves by moving
[0:28:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> I READ THAT TRILOGY LIKE 5 TIMES
[0:28:39] <marvel877> Like the one bit in Iron Man 2.
[0:28:40] <andrex2311> I didn't read them T_T
[0:28:41] <derap41> It will tug too hard
[0:28:42] <Halospaz117> God I fucking love this story about the armor
[0:28:45] <SubjectX07x> It will literally kill you if you are not genetically modified. @WoolieVersus
[0:28:45] <Ion_Laser> Fall of Reach is a good book
[0:28:45] <%Theycallmenerf> Hey chat make sure you got some specific home insurance.
[0:28:46] <OldOnyx> is Halsey even mentioned in the first game?
[0:28:46] <DigitalJoshie> trust V
[0:28:47] <KeiPrime> but can it fuck you tho
[0:28:50] <%Irridium> yeah a normal person's bones would just fucking break
[0:28:53] <andrei11dr> I can't wait until blank does the blank, it's going to be so coooolll Kappa
[0:28:53] <armchairmaster_> Is it a spoiler to say that Cortana gets THICCER as time goes on?
[0:28:57] <Ion_Laser> @OldOnyx Nope

[0:29:05] <%dekkitout> I forgot about that being the reason why spoilers are spoilers
[0:29:07] <Halospaz117> @OldOnyx No, but she was a major character in the Fall of Reach book which actually came out before CE
[0:29:14] <alexandrecau> look at them working on canada day
[0:29:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> TRAINING DOESN'T MATTER. YOU NEED SKELETAL AUGMENTS.
[0:29:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Halsey was only in the Fall of Reach book, not in the games till Reach
[0:29:18] <+Ether101_Prime> She isn't evil.
[0:29:22] <baki_morris> YO!!! Woolie did you know about the amour's ability to recycle piss?
[0:29:23] <+D00msDayDan> that's not halsey being evil, that's just R&D
[0:29:24] <%emperordread> Who is Dr Disrespect and what did he do?
[0:29:25] <taquito_blade> holy fuck lol I didn't know that

[0:29:39] <startstoprepeat> mjollinir armor will jack you off to death unless you're properly trained in its usage
[0:29:41] <SubjectX07x> She does not show up until Reach.

[0:30:40] <%Pinkiefan> I only played 1-3 and ODST. The lore isn't why I enjoy Halo.
[0:30:42] <%Irridium> yeah it's funny LUL

[0:30:56] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 2 did tho
[0:30:57] <%dekkitout> Is a ragdoll not proper if it spazzez tf out?
[0:30:58] <Ion_Laser> Ragdoll physics wasn't a thing until Max Payne 2 and Halo 2
[0:31:02] <HeavyC4> @Pinkiefan what an genius. nice job getting out of the ship before it blew up
[0:31:02] <%DSD24> Then here comes Demon's Souls!
[0:31:06] <DigitalJoshie> Halo3 has some hilarious rag doll in MP
[0:31:09] <+Graem> oh it's John Halo time
[0:31:09] <%Irridium> so they would not appreciate tea-bagging then, I take it
[0:31:11] <Calek> and then Demon's Souls was like "lol no"
[0:31:17] <%DSD24> Demon's Souls with all the ragdoll
[0:31:25] <CastellanVon> Valkyria Chronicles has some hilarious ragdolling
[0:31:25] <+How2BEpic> Reminds me of Hayao Miyzaki seeing that animated body moving super unnaturally and being very displeased.
[0:31:32] <+Graem> oh wow Woolie actually has TFH merch that's awesome
[0:31:34] <%SQUASH_5> SQUASH_5 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:31:34] <DomunDomunDomun> Good ol' halo 2/3 ragdolls where you backflip from being headshot.
[0:31:40] <%Theycallmenerf> If you rag dolled too hard in CE would it snap the physics in half? AKA hard crash game?
[0:31:41] <niddron> spin that corpse!
[0:31:44] <andrei11dr> Dark Souls 1 had even crazier ragdoll
[0:31:49] <FacetiousAF> that souls body? that's not a human, fuck it
[0:31:52] <Halospaz117> PRAISE THAT MAN
[0:31:54] <fmbboaventura> I wonder if this had something to do with bodies disappearing in DS2
[0:31:57] <%lewdskeletor13> My earliest memory of halo is being blasted high into the sky while rag dolling
[0:32:00] <%SirGO0SE> one guy found :)
[0:32:01] <+How2BEpic> I never get sick of DS ragdoll
[0:32:02] <huskarl_zap> the first
[0:32:02] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy
[0:32:11] <%PadreHail> Valkyria Chronicles ragdoll is amazing
[0:32:13] <%Irridium> https://clips.twitch.tv/TransparentAgitatedBottleDendiFace
[0:32:15] <%Irridium> there you go
[0:32:17] <CastellanVon> I remember modding TF2 to have ragdolls on like 300% shit was fucking hilarious. You shoot a dude and they ragdoll into the horizon.
[0:32:19] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Demon's Souls remake better still have the crazy ragdolls
[0:32:21] <%DSD24> "What's that over there?"
[0:32:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Two For Flinching
[0:32:22] <Halospaz117> HE'S GOT THE CLIP

[0:33:02] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 1 had a weird thing where if a dead body hanged off a ledge, the limbs would stretch to simulate gravity and it looks weeeird @woolieversus
[0:33:04] <vaderxyz1970> It's a shame Joel went crazy
[0:33:05] <StarlitStunner> Doc
[0:33:07] <armchairmaster_> The right answer is NOT CHURCH
[0:33:08] <DigitalJoshie> Caboose is great

[0:33:18] <%SirGO0SE> @MrMoonGoose brucegGoose brucegGoosewing sipsipHonk

[0:36:51] <%SomersaultJustice> GENOCIDE RUN FIRST
[0:36:53] <Dean_Inbetween> Little v is the only thing keeping this playthrough in check
[0:36:53] <danielmorn> Don't know how it works on pc but on X1 the terminals kick you out of the game to another app. Such trash
[0:36:55] <%eanscrale> Well it's more like Heaven or Hell mode
[0:36:55] <+SilverDevilfish> A 2nd playthrough of TTYD should be Thousands of Doors Kappa
[0:36:57] <+jiggy_snipe> naw man play it LIKE I WANT
[0:36:57] <fuji_92> speedrun this game you're playing for the first time woolie Kappa
[0:37:02] <%Pinkiefan> Are you going to do grenade chain warthog jumps?
[0:37:02] <Iam_Dead> woolyot why u play schute game? y u no play babby games?
[0:37:02] <Graxe_> Play DMC3 on DMD
[0:37:02] <HeavyC4> danger mario is crazy unless you got those royal guard skills and we know woolie dontgo' t those skills
[0:37:03] <%dinnydanny777> Woolie is the John Haloman, I am just the Dinnydanny sittingonacouchman
[0:37:05] <+brickwall35> yes
[0:37:06] <%prime_name> Those are the guys who only play on the super hard modes.
[0:37:06] <Graxe_> Do it
[0:37:06] <%KityLinn> yes
[0:37:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Peril Mario is great because some Badges give massive buffs but you have to Royal Guard everything.
[0:37:08] <%dekkitout> I mean...
[0:37:09] <+Blucarot> Like imagine you buy a brand new game and someone appears behind you shouting what to do like please chill
[0:37:09] <%Javaa01> You probably shouldn't play it on Legendary, in general
[0:37:09] <zaitje> Yes
[0:37:09] <%ringabal> There's guiding your hips, and then there's BDSM.
[0:37:09] <+tuchpi> @jessie_lockhart no clue on that
[0:37:10] <HeavyC4> play DMC3 on DMD on NG
[0:37:10] <KeiPrime> yes
[0:37:11] <fuji_92> yes
[0:37:13] <+TheShisno> Do you want Woolie to hate Halo?
[0:37:13] <Solidnick18> assholes
[0:37:17] <ThaSparren> The most I could see an argument for is heroic since thats what the game was balanced for
[0:37:17] <%DSD24> Woolie's struggle is nothing short of divine
[0:37:19] <a_mad_dragon> yes we do SoonerLater
[0:37:19] <armchairmaster_> Resident Evil Knife only NO ITEM BOX Chris Run
[0:37:23] <%Superbro64> yes :)
[0:37:24] <%SirGO0SE> @dinnydanny777 john sittingoncouchman for smash
[0:37:24] <HeavyC4> Halo 2 legendary WutFace
[0:37:27] <doinkofmankind> first time playing halo? BETTER DO A LASO PLAYTHROUGH
[0:37:30] <%dekkitout> Thought that was in Halo 3
[0:37:30] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @woolieversus peril mario is a legit build because some badges let you do insane damage or dodge attacks if you're on 1 health
[0:37:31] <%Invlux> lol uhoh
[0:37:32] <KeiPrime> at least heroic
[0:37:32] <%lewdskeletor13> pls play dee em cee two, is gud gaem

[0:37:49] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Legendary is brutal
[0:37:50] <Kougsss> me realizing channel point emotes expire after 24hours woolieTRASH
[0:37:50] <+FlubbedPig> I think Bungie's always said that Halo was usually balanced for Heroic. But yeah, Woolie being a shooter baby, Normal is perfectly fine.
[0:37:50] <maria_luke> Wait, Woolie has never played Halo?? (I mean, I played 3 before I played 1 so I get it but whoa)
[0:37:50] <OverlordLuna> Thanks Universe LuL

[0:47:38] <%DSD24> OOo lillypads
[0:47:42] <%dinnydanny777> This music is so atmospheric
[0:47:45] <%SirGO0SE> pew pew pew
[0:47:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> damn
[0:47:50] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I love how they retcon Avery Johnson herr
[0:47:51] <%Irridium> plasma pistol is legit good in this game
[0:47:56] <%gatorafan> Woolie is John, V is Halo
[0:48:02] <Halospaz117> @HeavyC4 Don't think there are subs for incidental dialogue like that, Cutscenes and other major dialogue should have subs
[0:48:04] <%Pinkiefan> So cool getting to see someone play this for the first time.
[0:48:04] <Jolly_Adventurer> He's putting ON the limiters PogChamp
[0:48:06] <%SirGO0SE> plasma pistol go brrrrrrrrrrr pow
[0:48:09] <+yeeter_baelish> plasma pistol + pistol = EZ clap
[0:48:10] <%eanscrale> ah projectile speed
[0:48:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Projectile vs hitscan
[0:48:14] <%DSD24> Hitscan right?
[0:48:15] <%Asuterisuku> Hitscan vs. Projectile.
[0:48:21] <jorniev> DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER HALOID?
[0:48:28] <armchairmaster_> So V decides to play Halo on ULTRA NIGHTMARE?!
[0:48:30] <%DSD24> I do
[0:48:32] <$Rumbutt> I once played on Easy with the rule of No Shooting. Got all the way to the 3rd mission with only melee and grenades before I got bored
[0:48:35] <thesoldierofjoy> plasma is also better for shields and bullets are better for flesh.
[0:48:37] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Just think Overwatch Woolie
[0:48:39] <zocano> Plasma pistol for this mission tho is WutFace
[0:48:51] <+yeeter_baelish> monkaS
[0:48:56] <zocano> Gonna have some problems
[0:49:00] <Solidnick18> hmm
[0:49:02] <Dean_Inbetween> OH BOY
[0:49:08] <Halospaz117> Man I lvoe how that turret is just a chair
[0:49:08] <%dinnydanny777> Shoot gun make the things go boom
[0:49:12] <+eiightbiitt> John Halo here to save the day
[0:49:13] <DomunDomunDomun> Plasma also has a strong hitstun in CE.
[0:49:16] <darkrogue7776> Wasn't there an easter egg with the marines in this mission? or an i confusing things?
[0:49:18] <Catpurrple> They still never fixed that plasma pistol rapidfire audio bug huh?
[0:49:20] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yes, Depends
[0:49:21] <jorniev> prepare for unforseen consequenses
[0:49:21] <%Irridium> fun fact plasma pistol auto-tracks the [REDACTED] so it's honestly really good for this
[0:49:23] <%Asuterisuku> Halo 2 fucked it up.
[0:49:24] <%DSD24> Halo 2 Pistol was so lame
[0:49:25] <%SirGO0SE> games with weak pistols are cowards
[0:49:25] <baki_morris> normal is for scrubs plasma pistol only is EZ
[0:49:28] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> The Halo 1 pistol was a bug in the damage value
[0:49:29] <RahuHordika> halo 3 pistol is TRASH
[0:49:32] <RunningNGunning> Halo 3 is complete garbo, Reach is pretty good
[0:49:36] <+D00msDayDan> halo 2 and 3 have garbage pistols, they've been good to great ever since
[0:49:41] <%Irridium> halo 2 pistol meant to be dual-wielded with plasma pistol. alone it's garbage
[0:49:44] <%dinnydanny777> Armored Core had a ridiculously good pistol
[0:49:44] <CastellanVon> Wait was Halo 1 pistol actually bugged lol?
[0:49:53] <+primax104> Deagle from CS!
[0:49:54] <huskarl_zap> BUT halo 2 has DUAL WIELD
[0:49:56] <%SableS139a> Halo 2's pistol was serious cheeks
[0:49:56] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Nice
[0:49:59] <HeavyC4> fan the hammer
[0:50:00] <+yeeter_baelish> sick
[0:50:01] <%DSD24> Fan the Hammer
[0:50:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:04] <Shardlab> I love plasma pistol
[0:50:04] <%Irridium> yeah plasma pistol in halo 1 is real good. can fire faster, overheats slower, and uses less charge overall if you don't charge it
[0:50:05] <+worldbrand> like when you'd bind fire to mouse wheel with the berettas!
[0:50:05] <%Gruhunchously> Fan the hammer
[0:50:08] <Halospaz117> Fan that plasma hammer
[0:50:10] <%SirGO0SE> haha plasma go plap plap plap
[0:50:12] <Shardlab> It's like a megabuster
[0:50:12] <jorniev> ITS HIIIIGH NOOOON IN HALOOOO
[0:50:14] <%dinnydanny777> Han the fammer
[0:50:15] <drewslo> halo 2 gun design was to make weapons that fit the traditional role better
[0:50:16] <%Pinkiefan> Yup, doing that it's one of the best in the game.
[0:50:20] <%SableS139a> Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
[0:50:20] <+eiightbiitt> does the plasma pistol over heat in rapid fire in this game?
[0:50:21] <RyuuAoi> Can't go wrong with Bond's pistol. Ever.
[0:50:24] <%Theycallmenerf> Halo pistol go brrrrr
[0:50:24] <andrei11dr> Dead Space has that ,it's not really a pistol, but it's the first weapon and it's the best weapon
[0:50:27] <%Javaa01> Too bad that just ends up jamming the weapon, unlike in the movies
[0:50:31] <Dean_Inbetween> Hmm i wonder why
[0:50:34] <+JoeCoolMaverick> I usually end up using plasma weapons in these games because they usually take out the Elite's shields faster. At least I think that's how that works?
[0:50:39] <+budyd> Is this the library? Or just before it?
[0:50:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> I was playing ion fury the other day and the pistol is my favorite in that cuz of the alt fire
[0:50:42] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Well mistake in the damage value, the H1 pistol was supposed to be a LOT weaker, but the mistake went unnoticed for a while, and when it was found, people liked it so much it was left as is.
[0:50:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Is this still Halo 1 or is it something different?
[0:50:44] <HeavyC4> @eiightbiitt no overheating here. this isn't mass effect. there venting heat so yay
[0:50:46] <%DSD24> @andrei11dr Plasma Cutter was so good
[0:50:46] <Ion_Laser> @budyd This is before it
[0:50:49] <Bronks_NYX> whoa is this woolie's first playthrough?
[0:50:50] <+phatmac16> Plasma charge shot + BR = Heaven
[0:50:51] <armchairmaster_> Plasma Cutter best gun
[0:50:56] <+budyd> just before the misery then.
[0:50:57] <Shardlab> Just Jackals and Grunts
[0:50:58] <FacetiousAF> back to the anime for me HeyGuys chat you play nice
[0:51:02] <DomunDomunDomun> Unggoy
[0:51:03] <jamesthebrave> Yeah the pistol equivalent in Dead Space is SUPER GOOD, doing a one gun run with it is really fun
[0:51:04] <+eiightbiitt> nice I forgot thanks
[0:51:09] <Ion_Laser> @Jessie_Lockhart Halo 1 with remastered graphics turned on
[0:51:11] <%Gruhunchously> Gruntin' Jackals
[0:51:11] <%Pinkiefan> @eiightbiitt if you get the hang of it, you can maintain a steady rate without overheating.
[0:51:12] <+Slimshazbot> They all have actual alien names too
[0:51:12] <%Irridium> think the race name is ungoy or something
[0:51:14] <%Asuterisuku> Grunts are not to be fucked with, as humorous as they are.
[0:51:17] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:51:17] <Halospaz117> Note, those are all the names given to them by Humans, their actual species have different names
[0:51:18] <doinkofmankind> the only adjustment I would make is too add IWHBYD skull.
[0:51:19] <+D00msDayDan> LUL
[0:51:19] <Dean_Inbetween> Hmm i wonder why we haven’t seen any elites...
[0:51:20] <jorniev> OUCH
[0:51:20] <%Asuterisuku> RIP Woolie.
[0:51:21] <%SuperKirby24> dam
[0:51:25] <+yeeter_baelish> couldnt stand being an anime pleb so I started reading the manga LuL
[0:51:30] <+Jessie_Lockhart> They have official names based on their race, but the Humans simplified it
[0:51:37] <andrei11dr> 13-15
[0:51:40] <%dinnydanny777> Always remember to pew pew
[0:51:40] <%Asuterisuku> I believe that's 9-8?
[0:51:41] <%subjectg> Unggoy is monkey in tagalog, they can’t catch a break
[0:51:43] <+treborant> what level are we in?
[0:51:46] <%Asuterisuku> Ah, I missed a few.

[0:51:55] <Ion_Laser> @treborant 343 Guilty Spark
[0:51:59] <+YabbaTroll> ?
[0:51:59] <+yeeter_baelish> yeah like the elites are called sangheli or something like that in their language
[0:52:01] <+D00msDayDan> i have literally never heard someone call it the peeler
[0:52:04] <+treborant> Thank you guys
[0:52:06] <thesoldierofjoy> a good thing to know is also the flashlight button on this level.
[0:52:07] <jorniev> what were the bug guys in 2 called?
[0:52:08] <%SableS139a> @yeeter_baelish You got it
[0:52:17] <+Skyebaker> havent heard the peeler since halo 2 lol
[0:52:18] <Halospaz117> Good ol Noob Combo
[0:52:28] <stayinthepocket> @jorniev Drones
[0:52:29] <+eiightbiitt> halo 2 plasma pistol combo br noob combo
[0:52:29] <HeavyC4> if only you can dual wield in halo 1
[0:52:31] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah, just John Wick it
[0:52:36] <%DSD24> I really liked the SMG in Halo 2
[0:52:38] <DigitalJoshie> I really like how the assault rifle looks
[0:52:39] <%PadreHail> Man the new graphics really bug out the atmosphere way harder than I remember
[0:52:41] <Halospaz117> Now that was a good stick
[0:52:41] <+Slimshazbot> I know, let Woolie play how he wants, but MAN I forgot how badly the remake changes the tone of this level
[0:52:48] <thesoldierofjoy> yuuuuup.
[0:52:48] <%optimasmaximas> we at flood yet?
[0:52:53] <thesoldierofjoy> shhh

[0:53:01] <HeavyC4> >you can use glitch >yay >enemy uses glitch >NOOOOOOOOOO
[0:53:01] <+lioan515> CHILL CHAT
[0:53:03] <sniffy77> more halo toys for infinite got revealed today. Has some spoilers about a character from H5
[0:53:03] <Decimated_body> STOP SPOILING ASSHOLE
[0:53:04] <%dinnydanny777> So Legendary is basically the enemy using human tech
[0:53:05] <TriadOrion> Shhhhhhhhhhhhh
[0:53:05] <armchairmaster_> @optimasmaximas SHUT we waint there yet
[0:53:06] <Shardlab> All the Sangehlli are dead already
[0:53:07] <%Asuterisuku> Same way I don't care about people using the auto-sniper in Counter-Strike.
[0:53:08] <Joestar1890> The what?
[0:53:09] <+D00msDayDan> look at that blood in classic graphics
[0:53:14] <%heartlesshealer> Question for chat, after Halo 2, was being able to dual-wield Needlers ever brought back? I vaguely remember my cousin always getting mad at me for doing that in VS matches because of post-humous kills
[0:53:17] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Shits fucked
[0:53:18] <%ringabal> Grey Fox? Sephiroth?
[0:53:19] <startstoprepeat> fair play, i know there's a lot of auto-aim in this game but woolie's gotten so much better at aiming these days
[0:53:19] <+Slimshazbot> Not a lot of water in here?
[0:53:19] <RahuHordika> wah happun
[0:53:20] <%Gruhunchously> Wha happun
[0:53:25] <andrei11dr> I forgot they actually fire differently on legendary
[0:53:27] <derap41> needlers are the best ones
[0:53:28] <%PadreHail> Nope they killed dual needlers after 2
[0:53:28] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:53:28] <%Asuterisuku> Dual wielding is OUT after 2.
[0:53:29] <Joestar1890> Rare Needler crystals!
[0:53:32] <Solidnick18> good choice
[0:53:35] <%heartlesshealer> Thanks guys
[0:53:35] <%SableS139a> Only time in the series we see Needler ammo, I think.
[0:53:36] <%dinnydanny777> Game : Would you like a Needler?
[0:53:36] <%Irridium> @heartlesshealer nope
[0:53:36] <%Asuterisuku> Thank god.
[0:53:37] <sniffy77> ovals make needles
[0:53:38] <%DSD24> I miss dual wielding
[0:53:39] <+eiightbiitt> Halo 1 needler is op
[0:53:39] <%optimasmaximas> @Decimated_body imagine thinking im spoiling and callin me an asshole, he was clearly occupied, fuck off
[0:53:41] <DomunDomunDomun> Only place needler ammo pickups shows up, I think.
[0:53:43] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> precious warpstone, yes-yes
[0:53:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Isn't this the only spot with needler ammo?
[0:53:46] <%subjectg> The only time we see needler ammo
[0:53:46] <+yeeter_baelish> dual wielding was hype
[0:53:49] <huskarl_zap> Fire gems at them
[0:53:50] <Joestar1890> Doesn't Halo 3 have dual-wielding?
[0:53:52] <baki_morris> would be a good time to change to classic graphics
[0:53:53] <thesoldierofjoy> yes
[0:53:58] <%Javaa01> Or Half Life, more specifically
[0:53:59] <%SableS139a> @Joestar1890 Yep
[0:53:59] <startstoprepeat> halo is the dark souls of video games
[0:54:00] <%PadreHail> Halo 3 has dual wielding just not with Needlers
[0:54:01] <+D00msDayDan> i thought dark souls came out in 1998
[0:54:01] <stayinthepocket> @joestar1890 Yep
[0:54:02] <%DSD24> Dual Needlers every time
[0:54:03] <huskarl_zap> But it doesnt predate kingsfield
[0:54:06] <armchairmaster_> V is mega cheese rn Kappa
[0:54:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Pick up a needler and get the whole planetary history
[0:54:10] <Atomic_Blowfish> Halo is the dark souls of environmental storytelling
[0:54:12] <%krispen_wa> Halo was the Dark Souls of shooters

[0:54:19] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:54:21] <thesoldierofjoy> 3 did, odst did not. neither did reach, but some elites could dual weild plasma rifles.
[0:54:24] <Solidnick18> um
[0:54:26] <andrei11dr> We have to get Plague to stare at these bricks Kappa

[1:04:21] <%PadreHail> Dude playing this level on og Xbox at midnight in a dark ass house at like 5 years old
[1:04:23] <%optimasmaximas> "peace yo, have fun"
[1:04:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dangerzone979 i had to turn this level off for a bit and work up the nerve to keep going. It wasnt really the flood so much as the music? like that flood attack music just ....feels "gross" and grimy
[1:04:30] <%PadreHail> Fucking sketch
[1:04:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Why dont they infect Jackals and Grunts?
[1:04:31] <%Gruhunchously> Ehoops
[1:04:38] <+Ether101_Prime> Rather have the Zerg then the Tyranids.
[1:04:48] <Halospaz117> @BallerSwagBro9k I think they're too weak to infect
[1:04:49] <Catpurrple> They become your friend
[1:04:49] <+Slimshazbot> @BallerSwagBro9k Too little biomass, they game made into carriers
[1:04:49] <DomunDomunDomun> @BallerSwagBro9k they suck and get made into carrier forms instead
[1:04:49] <%Asuterisuku> They're impervious to the whole melee to the back thing, too.
[1:04:49] <OverlordLuna> LUL
[1:04:51] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Yeah, the Flood reminds so much of Bungie's other game, like Marathon and Myth 1 and 2.
[1:04:52] <deadpoolking16> WHAT
[1:04:52] <+twohitgood> disarmed LUL
[1:04:53] <+YabbaTroll> @BallerSwagBro9k too small to turn em into a combat form
[1:04:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ballerswagbro9k Not enough biomass. They become something else.
[1:04:54] <+TheShisno> @ballerswagbro9k not big enough to be tasty. They do in Wars tho
[1:04:55] <cipher758> bug people
[1:04:55] <dankvonmemelord> flood buddies

[1:04:59] <CalderGaming> @BallerSwagBro9k some kind of genetic immunity? i forget
[1:05:00] <%Will9099> hes friend shaped now
[1:05:00] <BioticEmu> FLOOD BUDDY
[1:05:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BallerSwagBro9k gameplay limitations? Also its implied they still pile the corpses up to mush up into general biomass to make the tumor blobs
[1:05:02] <+Troispoint> ''Hello''
[1:05:02] <+pedrothecruel> dont forget the OG Tyranids
[1:05:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> FLOOD BUDDY
[1:05:06] <%Javaa01> @BallerSwagBro9k Grunts and Jackals suck at melee, so they don't bother grabbing them
[1:05:06] <+MidnightBurst12> eww
[1:05:07] <+theKingRamses> find the old head
[1:05:08] <StarlitStunner> Flood Buddy
[1:05:09] <%prime_name> The head is backwards!
[1:05:11] <drewslo> too little biomass for the combat forms
[1:05:12] <malcobraaklynny> @BallerSwagBro9k if I remember correctly Grunts and Jackals get turned into carrier forms
[1:05:14] <%optimasmaximas> LUL yup
[1:05:15] <%krispen_wa> IT'S SHAPED LIKE A FRIEND
[1:05:16] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The head in the back
[1:05:16] <%dinnydanny777> Weird flower stalk men
[1:05:17] <Dangerzone979> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah, the music just stresses you out in conjunction with the rest of all the crazy that is going on in this level
[1:05:26] <Shardlab> The head is just lulling backward
[1:05:27] <+Ether101_Prime> Tumors.
[1:05:29] <Joestar1890> That's a BIIIG bad
[1:05:30] <%SableS139a> Melee attacks and sniper rounds pretty much do nothing the the Flood combat forms. Get used to mid and close ranged combat.
[1:05:32] <%ringabal> Frikkin space plants, man
[1:05:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> you're hitting spongy fungal mass of course melee is useless
[1:05:46] <%dekkitout> This reminds me again of how the Infested in Warframe are just these poor wretches
[1:05:48] <Dangerzone979> Hate how the head and neck are just flung over the back on the infected elites
[1:05:51] <drewslo> more or less the only sentient life they can't effect are the hunters
[1:05:52] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @huskarl_zap (warning)
[1:05:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> FUN FACT: THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE GAME YOU SEE NEEDLER AMMO ON THE FLOOR. IT'S PURPLE CRYSTALS.
[1:06:05] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Like, if anybody played Myth 2: Soulblighter, the Flood remind me of the Myrkridia.
[1:06:05] <+D00msDayDan> @dekkitout i love it because it looks FUCKED
[1:06:05] <malcobraaklynny> what difficult is this on? Usually the armless guys try to headbutt you
[1:06:07] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur oh nice
[1:06:11] <Nomad94> @LiquidDinosaur okay, but why you gotta scream that at us
[1:06:13] <%SirGO0SE> didnt know that @LiquidDinosaur
[1:06:14] <+Jessie_Lockhart> “Why dont you put her in charge!”
[1:06:16] <Shardlab> He got gobbled
[1:06:17] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Like, the Myrkridia in Myth 2 are terrifying.
[1:06:18] <%Asuterisuku> Find Keyes!
[1:06:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> see?!
[1:06:22] <%optimasmaximas> @malcobraaklynny normal cause coward
[1:06:25] <Nomad94> @malcobraaklynny first off, Normal. And they can't headbutt in Halo 1.
[1:06:29] <trackles_64> Halo 3 is ocming soon
[1:06:31] <mdkcde> Fun fact in HEroic the spores will Blowup the fuck outta your shields
[1:06:37] <OldOnyx> All the bungie fps games barrow heavily from an old sci-fi novel series that started with Starhammer.
[1:06:40] <doinkofmankind> @malcobraaklynny they don't headbutt on any difficulty in 1
[1:06:44] <+jahansoundsystem> I swear i keep getting lost on this exact moment of the level
[1:06:45] <mdkcde> or at least they did in the fucked up Gearbox port
[1:06:49] <leroyslammin> Halo 3 was great.
[1:06:51] <malcobraaklynny> @Nomad94 after all these years I never realized that
[1:06:52] <mdkcde> another fun fact
[1:06:55] <%Pinkiefan> I remember trying to gather as many armless flood as possible.
[1:06:56] <omegadarknes> i work at amazon, they had a case of covid in my department so i left for home early
[1:07:03] <omegadarknes> glad to catch the stream
[1:07:05] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:07:05] <%Gruhunchously> oof
[1:07:06] <armchairmaster_> Go find crazy marine
[1:07:06] <+eiightbiitt> lol
[1:07:06] <+yeeter_baelish> those little guys annihilate your shields in legendary
[1:07:10] <mdkcde> If you ran forward and used the Flamethrower in the PC port, it will set YOU on fire
[1:07:15] <Solidnick18> grunts are a bunch of goofs
[1:07:15] <+Troispoint> Grunts are the most loveable cowards
[1:07:18] <drewslo> I thing it's an achievement to get out in less than 7 minutes
[1:07:22] <%Asuterisuku> I have to go to work in an hour or so but at least I can watch until then.
[1:07:24] <+Jessie_Lockhart> No one said Grunts were smart
[1:07:28] <leroyslammin> I still remember playing Custom Edition, and the map Huge Ass.
[1:07:29] <%PadreHail> DOWN IN FRONT
[1:07:30] <+sleepingwarrior2> These guys are the reason that the Halo series was M-rated. Becasue of the parasitic zmobies and blowing them to pieces.
[1:07:30] <+sunsetserenity1> It was either going toward you or the floor, it chose the flood
[1:07:31] <%optimasmaximas> @Troispoint just like pat
[1:07:37] <%dinnydanny777> If you can find a shotgun it's useful
[1:07:41] <%Gruhunchously> Grunts do that in later games don't they?
[1:07:46] <+Troispoint> @optimasmaximas of course
[1:07:47] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Shottie is hottie
[1:07:53] <malcobraaklynny> did he show Woolie the Hunter one-shot trick?
[1:07:56] <sniffy77> if you shoot their arms off you can get a cute flood buddy :3
[1:07:56] <%Asuterisuku> Oh hey, living Covenant.
[1:07:58] <+Slimshazbot> Bungie shotguns are always sooo goooooood
[1:07:59] <%subjectg> @gruhunchously shush, that’ll be a fun surprise
[1:07:59] <+yeeter_baelish> do grunts commit suicide in this one?
[1:08:00] <%RioGascar> i think later in halo 3 we have the flood actually transform people and aliens mid gameplay right?
[1:08:00] <marvel877> Also since they pop the stickies just make the explosion way worse.
[1:08:00] <%MrMoonGoose> DOOM rules
[1:08:00] <%a_goth_pancake> did woolie notice the heads dangling off their backs?
[1:08:04] <FeralRageGaming> little boys, bigger guns
[1:08:09] <%PadreHail> ENEMYYYY
[1:08:09] <%krispen_wa> When you think of it, John Halo really was the Last of Us
[1:08:19] <Nomad94> Kamikaze Grunts aren't a thing in Halo 1 yet, I THINK
[1:08:21] <maskedmustelid> Dark souls: Drop your shield! Halo: Don't drop your shield!
[1:08:28] <%PadreHail> I'm pretty sure The Flood is the reason why this game got an M rating
[1:08:29] <+yeeter_baelish> PogChamp
[1:08:30] <OverlordLuna> High Ground OP
[1:08:32] <marisot_lemonade> no grunts dont suicide in halo ce

And like its deleting his memory but it cant delete his brain-implanted dogtag so he can just remember his name, rank and serial number despite not even knowing what they mean other than "this is me"
[1:10:43] <+TheShisno> The only reason I know it's on Easy is because of a trivia section about the 2nd book, the novelization of this book, mentioning that the shotgun is only here on Easy
[1:10:43] <Shardlab> The frsher ones can use weapons

[1:12:07] <%DSD24> This looks so different from the OG shotgun
[1:12:09] <%alpacasintophats> the best combo in this game is shotgun and pistol
[1:12:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> My fav weapon! jessie2Heart
[1:12:09] <DigitalJoshie> I like it
[1:12:12] <%alpacasintophats> imo at least

[1:12:19] <%ringabal> TODAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE
[1:12:20] <+TheShisno> Oh no wait, there's a shotgun at the START of the mission on Easy
[1:12:21] <%Javaa01> It's like a 6.5/10 shotgun
[1:12:23] <%Will9099> mmmmmm oh yeah
[1:12:23] <Joestar1890> Best Girl that's not Cortana is here!
[1:12:25] <+yeeter_baelish> primary function right there LUL
[1:12:26] <thesoldierofjoy> the halo shotguns effective range is "up their nose"
[1:12:26] <maglebeast> ah the shotgun. The problem solver.
[1:12:28] <huskarl_zap> they fucked up the model
[1:12:30] <RahuHordika> "But what does it do in trickster?"
[1:12:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> ....coulnt you not go into these rooms in the original
[1:12:35] <%a_goth_pancake> @woolieversus there is a comic you should check out that details how... A CHARACTER, I DON'T KNOW WHO escapes from the floor in this level. It's called 'Breaking Quarantine' and it is gorgeous art wise.
[1:12:36] <RahuHordika> "Woolie it's a shotgun"
[1:12:36] <%optimasmaximas> @TheShisno true
[1:12:37] <SubjectX07x> 8 gauge is bigger than 12 gauge for anyone not knowledgable in guns, and this is an 8 Gauge with magnum loads. ;3
[1:12:38] <%Gruhunchously> It's not about NEEDING it
[1:12:39] <huskarl_zap> thats the halo 4 or 5 model
[1:12:44] <+TheShisno> The Halo 1 shotgun is a sniper
[1:12:45] <armchairmaster_> Switch to classic to see TRUE shotgun
[1:12:50] <%DSD24> Wasn't the shotgun more silver in the classic?
[1:12:51] <%Irridium> it's the Reach model
[1:12:53] <%Asuterisuku> Who said anything about NEEDING it?
[1:12:53] <+MidnightBurst12> one and done
[1:12:54] <+D00msDayDan> show woolie the range on the shotgun
[1:12:54] <maglebeast> @RahuHordika ....it's a gun. dude...
[1:12:57] <sniffy77> i used the meathook more than the flamethrower
[1:12:57] <huskarl_zap> it was all black
[1:13:01] <%anita_dickin> its reach shotgun but blue
[1:13:01] <+worldbrand> nah just use grenades until you find another one
[1:13:02] <jamesthebrave> The Super Shotgun in 2016 was horrifically overpowered once you got the fire two shots upgrade
[1:13:03] <+yeeter_baelish> yeah the remastered shotgun looks weird
[1:13:14] <+Rolandknight> I can say I don’t like how the remaster looks
[1:13:16] <%Irridium> anniversary uses the reach model for most weapons
[1:13:18] <jorniev> what gauge is the halo shotgun?
[1:13:18] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I have a name for this weapon. I call it the “Flood Killer”
[1:13:19] <+eiightbiitt> I think it looks awesome
[1:13:20] <+Slimshazbot> Its fairly hefty
[1:13:21] <Sauceboss15> shotgun SHREDS the flood
[1:13:24] <+TheShisno> It's the Reach model
[1:13:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait i fond an excuse for no grunt flood: Even as a zombie the grunt biomass might need methane to live and the gas tanks would be too fucked up to work
[1:13:32] <SubjectX07x> In Halo 1 the fall off ain't terrible honestly.
[1:13:33] <+yeeter_baelish> it looks like a clone trooper gun LuL
[1:13:38] <%dinnydanny777> The reach'll come to you anyway
[1:13:41] <SubjectX07x> In 2 on they really fucked it's reach.
[1:13:42] <+Slimshazbot> I remember the shotgun sued to clip through the camera when you fired at alunch
[1:13:42] <leroyslammin> The remaster is definitely too bright on this level.
[1:13:43] <%DSD24> Reload is so nice
[1:13:43] <DomunDomunDomun> Best shotgun in halo.
[1:13:44] <DigitalJoshie> dat some good range
[1:13:44] <%dinnydanny777> flood* wooos
[1:13:45] <+Slimshazbot> launch*
[1:13:45] <trackles_64> The old version looks better
[1:13:47] <%Asuterisuku> Another gun that 2 fucked up.
[1:13:47] <Joestar1890> @Jessie_Lockhart Call it: "The Dam"
[1:13:49] <sniffy77> I actually kinda hate how good the CE pistol is because it pretty much outclasses every other weapon in multiplayer
[1:13:50] <thesoldierofjoy> the falloff is from "all of the damage" to "tickle gun" when you're out of range
[1:13:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Chad Range
[1:13:51] <%a_goth_pancake> v, what was that mister Krabs noise?
[1:13:52] <thebestestkevin> I always thought carrier forms were infected grunts and jackals
[1:14:00] <malcobraaklynny> the classic model is the M90 shotgun while the Anniversary model is the M45 shotgun from Halo Reach
[1:14:02] <%Asuterisuku> This is the only Halo game I've played where the guns feel good to use.
[1:14:03] <huskarl_zap> fucking breach over the barrel but the tube needs to be pumped to chamber
[1:14:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur They become carrier forms
[1:14:11] <+Jessie_Lockhart> @joestar1890 doodGood
[1:14:17] <maglebeast> whoa what the hell was that?
[1:14:17] <%subjectg> @thebestestkevin they’re more like aggregates than one species
[1:14:17] <slatersev> no that was a human
[1:14:17] <+Slimshazbot> No that's a human
[1:14:20] <%ChoculaUltra> was
[1:14:22] <Joestar1890> Chad Shotty vs Virgin Assault Rifle
[1:14:23] <marvel877> It had pants, Woolie.
[1:14:23] <doinkofmankind> remastered CE is fine people are just nostalgia dinks
[1:14:24] <maglebeast> why did it flicker like that?
[1:14:24] <Joestar1890> WAS
[1:14:26] <+thegreenbenis> Look at the fatigues
[1:14:27] <Nomad94> that was a human
[1:14:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton arent carrier forms just combat forms that get old, or like, when the hive doesnt need more combat forms some just change?
[1:14:31] <%a_goth_pancake> yes
[1:14:31] <%dinnydanny777> In Classiv he actually looka like a skeleton
[1:14:32] <+TheShisno> That is an Ex-Human
[1:14:33] <leroyslammin> They're only human after all
[1:14:34] <jorniev> what was the gauge of this shotgun? was it 20?
[1:14:37] <armchairmaster_> Woolie check out the classic model, it's even BETTER
[1:14:42] <huskarl_zap> dont know
[1:14:44] <cipher758> plantheads
[1:14:46] <%optimasmaximas> name's out gang
[1:14:51] <Halospaz117> ITS SUCH A GOOD NAME
[1:14:53] <+worldbrand> like fighting water huh
[1:14:55] <+budyd> this isn't even the "best" flood level...
[1:14:56] <+Masamune195> whoops spoiled a lil lol
[1:14:56] <%zamzoph> wow, Woolie really know anything about Halo huh?
[1:14:59] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Like water
[1:15:00] <DomunDomunDomun> Remember when some people thought they were called flug?
[1:15:03] <%dinnydanny777> Oh I find them scary
[1:15:05] <malcobraaklynny> get it? Because it's like the Flood from the Bible
[1:15:05] <%Asuterisuku> The game dropped it earlier as the chapter name and Woolie didn't notice.
[1:15:05] <Sauceboss15> not scary YET
[1:15:06] <+yeeter_baelish> oh theyre scary
[1:15:06] <Solidnick18> yep just annoying
[1:15:13] <dankvonmemelord> scary if you're a child
[1:15:14] <%Will9099> and there will be billions
[1:15:14] <Shardlab> They don't get scary until Halo 3....
[1:15:17] <IntrepidEye> they were scary as hell when you are 12 first seeing them
[1:15:18] <%a_goth_pancake> nope, pretty scary.
[1:15:19] <+GreenCMD> just wait till *****mind
[1:15:21] <ZeZheZe> they may be scary soon...
[1:15:23] <bearalin> It’s raining a lot. It may flood.
[1:15:25] <%Taglog7> mama woolie: Flood you say
[1:15:26] <+thegreenbenis> They are super scary if you aren't a 9 foot superman with a forcefield. @WoolieVersus
[1:15:26] <%subjectg> they were pretty scary as a wee lad
[1:15:27] <maglebeast> What's that smell? IT'S FLOOOD!
[1:15:28] <%RioGascar> as a child these were terrifying
[1:15:29] <+Jessie_Lockhart> In story context they are very scary
[1:15:29] <+yeeter_baelish> *****mind monkaS
[1:15:30] <guenbooty> Bungie is always top tier at naming things
[1:15:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DomunDomunDomun Fug im a monument to ur sins :DDDDDDDD
[1:15:32] <DesertPenguin> Shooty McBangBang
[1:15:33] <+Slimshazbot> Lil baby me going from shooting brightly colored aliens with silly voices TO THIS fucking traumatized me
[1:15:33] <malcobraaklynny> the explosions in CE were fucking insane
[1:15:39] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> not scary when you're 7 foot tall, heavily armed, and have an energy shield to protect you from the drones
[1:15:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Now listen. I have no pity for infected Covenant Aliens. If I was in the bargaining table the sangheli wouldnt even have a homworld. There I said it
[1:15:40] <+Jessie_Lockhart> In game they’re annoying or just cute
[1:15:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> The M90 Close Assault Weapon System uses 8-Gauge Magnum ammo.
[1:15:43] <%DSD24> Also more blood in the OG version
[1:15:43] <Decimated_body> Would've been scarier if you weren't a super soldier
[1:15:45] <+phatmac16> As a kid these things gave me nightmares
[1:15:45] <%Asuterisuku> Man, seeing the physics objects like that shattered glass locked to 30fps is painful.
[1:15:48] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> they're scarier on classic
[1:15:48] <%a_goth_pancake> now I will speak, and you will listen
[1:15:52] <+worldbrand> Did V say plasma weapons or plasma pistol?
[1:15:54] <turbofolk> Until they say thingd
[1:15:54] <+yeeter_baelish> imagine how scary this is to normal marines tho
[1:15:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Burn Covenant species world to the atom
[1:15:57] <huskarl_zap> lol 8 gauge
[1:16:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot oh god, remember early in h level where your radar just FREAK OUT WITH RED DOTS
[1:16:04] <%Asuterisuku> This game has too many copy pasta rooms.
[1:16:04] <leroyslammin> The reason it ain't scary is mostly because you're playing anniversary. Classic graphics made it scarier.
[1:16:06] <+phatmac16> My brother and I used to call them popcorn
[1:16:08] <%heartlesshealer> It's fine, V
[1:16:09] <Joestar1890> @worldbrand Plasma Pistol
[1:16:11] <huskarl_zap> cool but 10 and below is basically a mortor
[1:16:12] <%Asuterisuku> As the guns get worse, the map design gets better.
[1:16:15] <Dangerzone979> SMG bullets are rectangles in Halo
[1:16:18] <Halospaz117> But the bit V!
[1:16:18] <Joestar1890> Do what you need to, V
[1:16:20] <huskarl_zap> mortar
[1:16:25] <Halospaz117> THE BIT
[1:16:26] <malcobraaklynny> is it true that the super op pistol in this game was a result of a coding mistake?
[1:16:28] <DesertPenguin> Fuck 12-gauge, get a 2-bore
[1:16:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Here lies the bit
[1:16:31] <+Slimshazbot> @LiquidDinosaur Or see that flood elite in the fog at the start
[1:16:33] <%heartlesshealer> early game isn't the best place for that particular bit
[1:16:33] <%lewdskeletor13> THE BIT breebuPls
[1:16:37] <%dinnydanny777> Pistol is both a shotgun and a sniper rifle
[1:16:39] <+budyd> good shot
[1:16:39] <Solidnick18> nice
[1:16:43] <+TheShisno> Good ol Soellkraft 8 gauge shells
[1:16:43] <andrei11dr> Halo has some great fucking names, like i think one of the grenades are called Cleansing Flame
[1:16:44] <huskarl_zap> USE CANISTER SHOT
[1:16:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @malcobraaklynny allegedly yes
[1:17:06] <drewslo> if I remember right it's 8 gauge magnum rounds so extra powder
[1:17:07] <+D00msDayDan> the doom climb and the resident evil spin
[1:17:09] <%dinnydanny777> Halo only has bunny hops
[1:17:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Also Brutes deserve no pity.
[1:17:16] <a_mad_dragon> there was a problem here, it's gone now
[1:17:17] <ThaSparren> It is the Chiefs stand [Problem Solver]
[1:17:21] <+TheShisno> Revolutionary for 2001 on consoles
[1:17:21] <+yeeter_baelish> god this was 2001? its setting in monkaS
[1:17:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Brutes are the worse
[1:17:24] <CursedNobleman> LUL Ladders. what will those crazy scientists come up with next?
[1:17:25] <+TheShisno> Deep pockets
[1:17:28] <Nomad94> hell yeah you can
[1:17:30] <+Jessie_Lockhart> It took years for Samus to get a ledge grab
[1:17:31] <leroyslammin> Elites are just Alien Space Marines when it comes to naming conventions.
[1:17:31] <%Asuterisuku> And you will use them all.
[1:17:32] <jorniev> my favorite shotgun ever is the one DESSERT PUNK uses
[1:17:33] <%black_pariah> How has woolie never heard of the flood? I've never touched Killzone but I know who the Helghast are
[1:17:34] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> halo shotguns are the best shotguns in any fps IMO
[1:17:39] <+TheShisno> Almost 20 year old franchise oh god
[1:17:44] <malcobraaklynny> the magnum fires 12.7mm/ .50 cal
[1:17:46] <jamesthebrave> I've been playing a lot of Doom 3 recently and it's nice to see a shotgun that can hit from further than point blank range
[1:17:46] <%lewdskeletor13> Look Gordon, ropes! We can use these to traverse big pits
[1:17:46] <FunkyStreams> an amount that doesn;t actually makes sense. Halo shotgun is master of impossible space.

[1:18:04] <+yeeter_baelish> shotgun is so OP LUL
[1:18:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pistop range is crazy. Me and my friend would have no-shield pistol duels from across Blood Gulch while screen-looking. I could consistently nail headshots in half a clip, or 1 clip without zoom.
[1:18:08] <%ChoculaUltra> whoa 3D!

[1:18:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:18:14] <MajoraZ> @jorniev 8 guage, most human weapons in the halo universe used oversized ammo by modern standards due to advancedments in materials tech for body armor and advanced recoil mitigation systems
[1:18:22] <DigitalJoshie> dat was a BIG boom
[1:18:22] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, you missed some Shotgun ammo.
[1:18:23] <+kewlmyc> I LIVED BITCH
[1:18:27] <drewslo> the sniper fires 14.9 so bigger than a 50. cal
[1:18:36] <Nomad94> there it is
[1:18:40] <%DSD24> Classic Shotgun
[1:18:44] <%dinnydanny777> Is it big spoilers?

[1:19:09] <%dinnydanny777> Oh good, lots and lots of symbiotes
[1:19:10] <+thegreenbenis> Holy crap good music
[1:19:11] <+TheShisno> Good ol Foehammer!
[1:19:12] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Buddies!
[1:19:13] <Nomad94> @Slimshazbot You're asking why a lit hallway actually needs a ligthsource?
[1:19:13] <%a_goth_pancake> foehammar!
[1:19:15] <SainEdge> SourPls
[1:19:17] <%dinnydanny777> Perfect, lots of symbiotes for the flood
[1:19:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> Okay dis hard SourPls
[1:19:29] <%RioGascar> Oh can you not swap weapons with marines yet?
[1:19:30] <%optimasmaximas> fog
[1:19:32] <%a_goth_pancake> now keep everyone alove
[1:19:32] <%Gruhunchously> You can't even use them as meat shields anymore, they just turn into more eneimes
[1:19:32] <+Slimshazbot> @Nomad94 No, why do they need to make the entire WALL out of pretty lights in a spooky level
[1:19:45] <Nomad94> @Slimshazbot Forerunner shenanigans
[1:19:47] <%RioGascar> Thats halo 3 i think where you can swap weapons with marines
[1:19:48] <Nomad94> LUL
[1:19:48] <%dinnydanny777> They're dead
[1:19:52] <+TheShisno> Yo that marine just got brained by his buddy
[1:19:55] <+D00msDayDan> @RioGascar halo 2 onward
[1:19:57] <+Bailey__gaming> Hi Woolie <3 hi chat, am feelin p low so imma chill and hpfly get a smile
[1:20:03] <%Asuterisuku> They're Headcrabs just in huge numbers.
[1:20:03] <+yeeter_baelish> I always tried to get all the marines through the level as a kid LuL
[1:20:05] <Joestar1890> @RioGascar Halo 2 has that too
[1:20:05] <+Slimshazbot> @Nomad94 I get that, but it makes the level so much less creepy if it's super well lit, y'know?
[1:20:07] <DigitalJoshie> that one dud straight upshot gunned that dudes head
[1:20:11] <%DSD24> @Bailey__gaming I hope you feel better!
[1:20:14] <malcobraaklynny> if you look closely at the reload of the shotgun, the shell isn't actually being loaded into the gun; it's fixed to his hand as the animation loops back and forth
[1:20:16] <DigitalJoshie> dude*
[1:20:18] <%Gruhunchously> Man, if only YOU were child super-soldiers with state of the art armor
[1:20:19] <%dinnydanny777> Spartans are the bourgeoisie soldiers
[1:20:21] <%heartlesshealer> only 1 human
[1:20:27] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:20:35] <drewslo> battle rifle doesn't have a real world equivalent but the closest is the 9x39mm so basically subsonic rounds that hit like a truck
[1:20:36] <%Invlux> PogChamp
[1:20:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur In the book, one punches through the armor when his shields are down, touches his spine, and he is instantly paralyzed. Cortana had to do some bullshit with overcharging the shield capacitors to zap it and shocked his nervous system a bit.
[1:20:41] <SainEdge> Kreygasm
[1:20:42] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Thats why Chief is “The Demon” like some Covenant boogieman
[1:20:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> Pog
[1:20:44] <%RioGascar> Also our shield is rechargable while the covenant does not have them
[1:20:46] <%subjectg> Bulltrue
[1:20:47] <Joestar1890> SHOTGUN BESTO
[1:20:52] <%heartlesshealer> sounds like 0 humans left now
[1:20:55] <%DSD24> FEAR Shotgun is the best
[1:20:55] <%Asuterisuku> Shotgun is no use against shields though.
[1:20:55] <%ChoculaUltra> Getting infected by some bio-organic mass/body horror has always been in my top 5 nopes.
[1:20:59] <Halospaz117> Oh no there are some shit ones
[1:21:00] <+Double_Tap_That> I dunno, I've seen some bad shotguns
[1:21:01] <%a_goth_pancake> Squid1 Kreygasm Squid4
[1:21:02] <yoru899> BUCKSHOT
[1:21:03] <+greatgetter> Doom 3
[1:21:03] <%SomersaultJustice> Perfect Dark's shotgun is super weak
[1:21:04] <%RioGascar> its the one bit of tech humanity has that WE DO NOT WANT THE COVENANT GETTING
[1:21:04] <+the22cstomp> MW3 shotguns sucked
[1:21:05] <NotHereToStream> model 1887
[1:21:07] <IntrepidEye> rather surprise a shotgun is good against space zombies
[1:21:08] <+yeeter_baelish> pistols are bad in a lot of games
[1:21:09] <Teh10sorrow> There is nothing more sad and telling if your shotgun is bad in a game
[1:21:11] <%optimasmaximas> hmm
[1:21:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Shotty too hotty
[1:21:12] <+yeeter_baelish> monkaS
[1:21:13] <MasterMushin> The Darkness has a terrible shotgun
[1:21:13] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Yeah CoD has some shit shotguns
[1:21:13] <+TheShisno> Robits!
[1:21:13] <DigitalJoshie> laters CoD have some lame shotguns
[1:21:13] <%Asuterisuku> Counter-Strike shotguns Kreygasm
[1:21:15] <+MidnightBurst12> shotgun being good against zombies. who knew?
[1:21:16] <sniffy77> in the novelization of this game a infection form grabs chief when he has his shields down and in a second it sends a tentacle through his body suit and tries to wrap around his spine.
[1:21:17] <%Gruhunchously> New faction
[1:21:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton yeah i remember,
[1:21:18] <ThaSparren> Bad Company 2 has sniper rifle shotguns
[1:21:20] <+yeeter_baelish> 4 FACTION
[1:21:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> hey does anyone know about the reprint of Fall of Reach? did they change the ridiculous idea in that book that Chief never fought an Elite until the battle of Reach? Even as a kid i just ignored that because it was patently stupid
[1:21:20] <drewslo> I miss mw2 spas 12
[1:21:22] <PanicSwytch> The M10 in Battlefield 1 is godlike
[1:21:23] <resloxxx> SLUG Kreygasm
[1:21:23] <Dean_Inbetween> oh here we go
[1:21:24] <%subjectg> good ol model 1887s
[1:21:24] <ThatGuyThere03> Even detractors of the series acknowledge the superiority of the Halo shotgun
[1:21:26] <+TheShisno> Hm
[1:21:26] <Mr_Taters > *stares at model 1887 before nerf*
[1:21:27] <Shardlab> Say hi to the Sentinels
[1:21:28] <DomunDomunDomun> You thought you were getting a third faction, you're getting a fourth.
[1:21:29] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Spas was like a sniper
[1:21:30] <Joestar1890> Robots to the recsue?
[1:21:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Pancor Jackhammer in every game is in
[1:21:31] <CursedNobleman> sharks with laser beams PogChamp
[1:21:32] <armchairmaster_> VLK Rogue is the fucking WORST shotgun
[1:21:33] <huskarl_zap> Slugs are a thing
[1:21:33] <%dinnydanny777> Shotgun is especially good against any form of infectious being
[1:21:39] <%zamzoph> Kappa
[1:21:39] <thesoldierofjoy> because thats how actual shotguns work, but video games need to be balanced to be fun.
[1:21:40] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I was always an AA12 fan
[1:21:40] <+TheShisno> Nice change of pace
[1:21:42] <%DSD24> Model 1887 was so good
[1:21:42] <%Asuterisuku> Kappa
[1:21:44] <%a_goth_pancake> fucking mindless ambition, amirite chat?
[1:21:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> GREEN LANTERN HELP ME I HAVE NO ARMS
[1:21:45] <sniffy77> FLOOD BUDDY!
[1:21:50] <malcobraaklynny> The reason regular humans can’t use spartan armor is because the suit will literally kill them
[1:21:51] <doinkofmankind> plasma pistols are super important coming up.
[1:21:55] <donstylo> Oh boy the next level...

[1:23:09] <%dinnydanny777> Halo is a survival horror game masquerading as a fps space opera
[1:23:10] <%Frubblord> the absolute worst level
[1:23:10] <%Asuterisuku> one of the worst levels in the game.
[1:23:11] <Shardlab> This is the mission I got shanghaied into playing Halo by my best friend

[1:23:45] <+Jessie_Lockhart> BOOOMER!
[1:23:47] <DigitalJoshie> they are aren't they
[1:23:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> Whatever you say Boomer
[1:23:48] <drewslo> that's bat what grunts become
[1:23:49] <%PadreHail> ONE SHOT ON LEGENDARY
[1:23:51] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur exuberant witness and guilty spark are cool as fuck
[1:23:52] <+yeeter_baelish> SHOTGUN PogChamp
[1:23:57] <doinkofmankind> I love their squiggly little arms
[1:23:58] <drewslo> basically*
[1:24:05] <+phatmac16> POPCORN
[1:24:06] <+MeatBomb> Are they playing co-op?
[1:24:06] <%r0chelimit> my dad used to call them Jiffy men
[1:24:09] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Imagine a Smoker or Hunter in this
[1:24:10] <jorniev> I would call more action horror before calling it survival horror
[1:24:11] <+Ether101_Prime> @LiquidDinosaur I thought the name of the type of drone is Guilty Spark.
[1:24:12] <TheGunrunner91> Man, I love The Flood as an enemy force.
[1:24:14] <dankvonmemelord> wrong way
[1:24:15] <huskarl_zap> classic is sho much darker
[1:24:17] <Xiangchang> If you look at their legs, you can see that they're stubby Grunt legs.
[1:24:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> @meatbomb yea yea
[1:24:21] <%krispen_wa> wow it is way spookier in classic
[1:24:23] <Joestar1890> @MeatBomb Yeah, they're playing co op
[1:24:26] <%Asuterisuku> Keep your AR, plasma rifle bad here.
[1:24:26] <+MeatBomb> Nice.
[1:24:30] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, classic's got worse lighting
[1:24:30] <huskarl_zap> hmm
[1:24:35] <%DSD24> Always liked the plasma rifle
[1:24:36] <%RioGascar> keep the AR
[1:24:37] <marisot_lemonade> when they explode they also make dropped weapons fly
[1:24:38] <%alpacasintophats> I'd keep on remastered for sight reasons
[1:24:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas Bungie is THE BEST at making cool names for ancient alien magic technology. Nobody is better at pseudomystical technobabble either
[1:24:42] <%RioGascar> its better and sounds cooler
[1:24:45] <huskarl_zap> Did they change the old model aswell?
[1:24:46] <kulmoth> classic has better mood
[1:24:49] <@akuda_bar> "I missed you babe" woolieGASM
[1:24:49] <Nomad94> 049 Abject Testament
[1:24:49] <RunningNGunning> Get the Valve Index
[1:24:58] <guenbooty> Plasma vs the flood not great
[1:24:59] <donstylo> Flood with Rocketlauncher.
[1:24:59] <%alpacasintophats> otherwise you're going to need that flashlight alot
[1:25:00] <drewslo> or a flood with a rocket launcher
[1:25:00] <leroyslammin> Classic's lighting is better for Flood Levels to be honest. Fits the mood better.
[1:25:03] <%dinnydanny777> The Flood basically play like you
[1:25:05] <TheGunrunner91> classic is more a e s th e t ic
[1:25:06] <%RioGascar> The passive way woolie is playing is driving me crazy
[1:25:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Ether101_Prime no the Monitor for Installation 05 (the one in Halo 2) is named 2401 Penitent Tangent
[1:25:08] <%ChoculaUltra> "Ah, you were at my side all along" - Woolie, to his Moonlight Shotgun
[1:25:10] <jorniev> ZOMBIES USING SHOTGUN S
[1:25:11] <%Asuterisuku> They explode into more flood too.
[1:25:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1277817541960876033?s=20
[1:25:12] <malcobraaklynny> For an og Xbox game there sure are a lot of enemies on screen
[1:25:13] <DigitalJoshie> body horror with a shot gun
[1:25:16] <%dinnydanny777> What's classic look like btw
[1:25:19] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur was exuberant named by bungie before they stopped halo stuff?
[1:25:23] <FunkyStreams> I just wonder what Woolie was busy playing when this came out, originally. And I wonder what Im busy playing while this is out.
[1:25:28] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Omg flood with a shotgun would be the worst if not for a flood with something else
[1:25:29] <leroyslammin> I've rarely, if ever needed the flashlight un anniversary.

[1:26:03] <%Asuterisuku> There's a skull at the very start of 343 Guilty Spark, hidden among the trees near the chopper.
[1:26:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas the point is, Bungie names things [number] [adjective] [noun]
[1:26:07] <malcobraaklynny> It’s nice that 343 couldn’t just teleport Chief to the top floor

[1:27:06] <GameOver_Here> Worst level in the game
[1:27:06] <%DSD24> "I am a genius!" "OH NO"
[1:27:09] <%lewdskeletor13> He sure did
[1:27:09] <%Asuterisuku> This level is so bad. Too many identical rooms.
[1:27:09] <jorniev> SO THAT IS WHAT IT WAS
[1:27:09] <RunningNGunning> Welcome to fuck
[1:27:16] <+phatmac16> WELCOME TO HELL
[1:27:16] <+D00msDayDan> "yeah, and i'm rear admiral"
[1:27:23] <%dinnydanny777> That looks nice in the original
[1:27:24] <%Gruhunchously> What are you talking about this mission's great
[1:27:27] <%Irridium> sure is
[1:27:31] <%dinnydanny777> I actually prefer the lighting
[1:27:33] <+Slimshazbot> You shoulda seen the last level in classic
[1:27:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 Yes. he hasnt been defragged in 100,000 years he's a bit buggy
[1:27:38] <armchairmaster_> The V i b e s
[1:27:39] <Sauceboss15> yeah still prefer og graphics
[1:27:42] <iamtheTwitchghost> OG xbox version looks better than the MCC version
[1:27:45] <Nomad94> I like the new Library, even though I hate it
[1:27:47] <Explodincatz> less lighting
[1:27:51] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie keeps not picking up his shotgun ammo.
[1:28:07] <startstoprepeat> old library looks like a tech cathedral
[1:28:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> it is
[1:28:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> IIRC it is
[1:28:21] <%heartlesshealer> ENJOY THE LIBRARY
[1:28:21] <Nomad94> It sure is
[1:28:24] <%alpacasintophats> no it isn't
[1:28:28] <+yeeter_baelish> just get through
[1:28:29] <marvel877> Shooting gallery, the stage.
[1:28:29] <%alpacasintophats> they do stop after a bit
[1:28:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> is that why people got upset over the demon's souls remake
[1:28:30] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> halo is basically the predator of fps games, where it starts as a big actiony macho story and hard swings into a survival horror half way through
[1:28:32] <%optimasmaximas> you mean...halo infinite Kappa
[1:28:32] <malcobraaklynny> it's great that they let you toggle between classic and Anniversary graphics in real time
[1:28:35] <%Irridium> it isn't but it's a fucking lot of them
[1:28:38] <%Greytechsy> Greytechsy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:28:41] <drewslo> no but it feels infinite
[1:28:41] <%Gruhunchously> THe Destiny Model
[1:28:43] <marvel877> I'm the weird person that actually like this stage.
[1:28:45] <%Javaa01> And it will be for the next 25 minutes
[1:28:46] <unclekulikov> I like the assault rifle for this level
[1:28:49] <smuggleruncle> never played the og so the old just looks dated and I don't any of those feels
[1:28:51] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Follow R2
[1:28:55] <%subjectg> Just wait until we get to the hell room
[1:29:00] <+yeeter_baelish> guilty spark is basically the ghost from destiny
[1:29:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'm almost positive that there is a never ending trickle of enemies even after you clear all the scheduled waves.
[1:29:09] <$jake5713> CURRENT OBJECTIVE: SURVIVE
[1:29:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> also right now your armor is 1/6 forerunner armor protection
[1:29:11] <leroyslammin> @marvel877 You're not alone. Getting lost in it felt immersive as hell
[1:29:12] <Nomad94> @marvel877 but why tho? it's the same repetitive hallway for half an hour
[1:29:16] <%Javaa01> Well, enjoyable
[1:29:17] <%Asuterisuku> "First of ten."
[1:29:17] <zocano> Ya the Library isn’t a bad level, it’s run like hell and never stop moving except for the small moments where you have to hunker and survive
[1:29:19] <Sauceboss15> this brings back memories of legendary co-op with my big bro
[1:29:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> OH MY GOD THAT IS AN AMAZING FIX
[1:29:30] <+Slimshazbot> There's a reason this is a widely hated level
[1:29:31] <iamtheTwitchghost> @smuggleruncle a big problem with the OG graphics in Halo Anniversary is that it's based in the Gearbox pc port, which fucks up a lot of textures and shaders
[1:29:32] <Nomad94> that makes it so much better
[1:29:33] <%Asuterisuku> @zocano Except when it forces you to stop moving.
[1:29:34] <zocano> It’s endless on the edge survival on the higher difficulties
[1:29:35] <Joestar1890> Ghosts
[1:29:35] <%DSD24> Ghost
[1:29:37] <%optimasmaximas> good redesign
[1:29:37] <%Gruhunchously> The Dinkledge bot
[1:29:38] <FunkyStreams> which is a change that doesn;t really make sense.
[1:29:40] <CursedNobleman> floating ball peter dicklage

[1:29:52] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> well Nolan bot
[1:29:53] <%Asuterisuku> Guilty Spark also appears in KI as the Fractured Ward guardian spirit.
[1:29:54] <zocano> @asuterisuku literally the second part of my sentence
[1:29:55] <smuggleruncle> @iamtheTwitchghost I see
[1:29:56] <%RyTYoung> There's a witch on da MOON
[1:30:00] <+Bailey__gaming> SHOOT ZE GLASS

[1:30:07] <%Gruhunchously> It's also an escape elevator!
[1:30:08] <+yeeter_baelish> that wizard came from the moon LuL
[1:30:18] <OldManDeckardCain> that's where anor londo is
[1:30:31] <%ringabal> The Last of Us 2 sure took a narrative swerve here.
[1:30:40] <+yeeter_baelish> low ammo monkaS
[1:30:50] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, he had a shotgun grab it.
[1:30:54] <%Will9099> the flood deliver the ammo to you
[1:30:56] <Joestar1890> @OldManDeckardCain No, that's definitely blighttown
[1:30:58] <time_axis> this part of the game just annihilates my OCD
[1:31:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ringabal Half-Jaw clubs cortana to death
[1:31:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I guess we really are the Master Chief Collection."
[1:31:02] <DigitalJoshie> "floating ball thing, I'm a bit busy for lore right now"
[1:31:04] <%subjectg> he’ll be alright
[1:31:06] <iamtheTwitchghost> If people wanna know about the graphical downgrade that Halo 1 suffered with the PC port and the anniversary OG graphics mode, here's a link, kinda: ?v=M6nZPrMSu0w
[1:31:23] <iamtheTwitchghost> just add youtube before and yadada
[1:31:25] <%Gruhunchously> @time_axis What OCD?
[1:31:26] <Dean_Inbetween> OH I CANT WAIT TILL THEY FIND
[1:31:31] <Dean_Inbetween> rocket flood
[1:31:31] <Mr_Taters > @ringabal It was nice that the protagonists were able to resolve there differences with nice round of Halo 1 co-op
[1:31:32] <%dinnydanny777> Human weapons are built for killing zambambos
[1:31:35] <leroyslammin> I hope there's a mod that fixes the graphics in the port.
[1:31:37] <ThatGuyThere03> rip marvin
[1:31:40] <FunkyStreams> because of their simpliciity
[1:31:49] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Overchargu!
[1:31:50] <+Slimshazbot> I always prefer ballistic weapons over energy weapons
[1:31:50] <time_axis> @Gruhunchously Just not being able to kill everything, wasting ammo on enemies that just explode anyway. The whole thing just feels bad to me.
[1:31:52] <%Asuterisuku> 343 notes specifically that Human weapons work better than covenant ones.
[1:31:54] <jorniev> remember how silent Hill 3 did the same thing lastofus2 tried to do but better?
[1:31:58] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur that one scene but it’s tartarus decking the arbiter
[1:32:00] <FunkyStreams> think repricators in SG!
[1:32:01] <+yeeter_baelish> hes yuckin it up

[1:35:53] <%nosubstancex> nosubstancex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Much love from Brandon and Maribel. I told Pat this as well. But I was the lead designer on the Kena game during the prototype and pitching for a year and half. Working for free at times. They decided to fire me right as they were about to sign.
[1:35:54] <CurrySauseBandit> @yeeter_baelish It's KEEP MOVONG the level on Legendary, it's great LUL
[1:35:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @a_goth_pancake It doesn't even use Neural Physics

[1:36:59] <+yeeter_baelish> yup LuL
[1:36:59] <%dinnydanny777> That really does sound fun

[1:37:02] <jorniev> frag em don't sticky them
[1:37:05] <%dinnydanny777> :)
[1:37:09] <%Asuterisuku> V just described Legendary.
[1:37:17] <+yeeter_baelish> I always walk over enemies to scoop up ammo
[1:37:19] <DigitalJoshie> thats just CBT
[1:37:26] <drewslo> just remembered the forunner better weapon is the suppressor, the worst weapon in all of halo
[1:37:26] <+yeeter_baelish> its a great time
[1:37:26] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Flood do drop weapons Woolz
[1:37:31] <Nomad94> Halo 2 Legendary Coop is the worst
[1:37:35] <+TheDankDemon> then add all skulls PogChamp
[1:37:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Asuterisuku oh god i remember my friends at school saying i was a pussy for not playing on Legendary and i was like iT ISNT FUN, AND HEROIC SAYS "THIS IS HOW HALO IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED"
[1:37:54] <FunkyStreams> I wonder what makes the Sentinels so good at killing Flood, hmmm
[1:37:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> "HEROIC IS THE INTENDED DIFFICULTY"
[1:37:58] <%Asuterisuku> Legendary really isn't fun.
[1:38:03] <%alpacasintophats> stopping the carrier forms dispersing the small dudes only can be done in halo 3 with grenades. Specifically the spike one. You can get lucky with grenades cleaning up the small ones though.
[1:38:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> it turns the game into a pop n shoot cover shooter
[1:38:11] <+TheShisno> Heroic canon
[1:38:13] <jorniev> what do you get from beating legendary? gamer cred?
[1:38:13] <ThatGuyThere03> @LiquidDinosaur but play on legendary tho dork
[1:38:13] <Medevalman> one thing to note, infection forms die to 1 hit from any weapon
[1:38:17] <Nomad94> @LiquidDinosaur To be fair, Legendary for me has always been an exercise in "can I safely run past these guys and get away with it"
[1:38:18] <%subjectg> legendary is fun in it’s own way
[1:38:20] <MyNameIsRasus> He turned his pistol into a pickle
[1:38:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> i mean yeah i DID it
[1:38:24] <Nomad94> and it works remarkably often
[1:38:24] <%ekodrop> pew pew
[1:38:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> to prove i did, it sucked and was just a challenge
[1:38:45] <zocano> Legendary is fun on most of them, Halo 2 is the only one where it’s skewed too hard into fuck you
[1:38:46] <+yeeter_baelish> monkaS
[1:38:53] <Catpurrple> Rocket launcher flood are the worst
[1:38:53] <%Asuterisuku> Rocket Launcher down!
[1:38:56] <+yeeter_baelish> the flashbacks NotLikeThis
[1:38:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ThatGuyThere03 also in halo 1 i didnt realize it was a picture of an elite skull because i didnt pick up that they have 4 jaws and i was like "what the fuck is this"
[1:38:57] <FunkyStreams> that's right Woolie, pick that weapon.
[1:38:59] <+D00msDayDan> time until woolie blows himself up with the rocket launcher
[1:39:01] <Nomad94> Halo 2 final boss is straight Fuck You territory
[1:39:03] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Fuck Rocket Flood

[1:39:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Flood with a rocket launcher is the true Vergil of this game.
[1:39:15] <+Slimshazbot> Still gotta say Halo 2's my favorite Halo campaign
[1:39:15] <%ringabal> Woolie does not discriminate in the space war
[1:39:16] <Floofiie> Just finished Jackal Alley and Jackal Valley in Halo 2 Legendary last night @zocano monkaS

[1:39:17] <%optimasmaximas> lawnchair LUL
[1:39:19] <+EMFole> weirdly enough, this level was super easy for me on legendary I had way more trouble with truth and reconciliation
[1:39:20] <%Gruhunchously> Lawn chair
[1:39:22] <%subjectg> i play legendary mostly because i feel heroic is too easy these days
[1:39:22] <%lotharrio> Rawket Lawnchair!
[1:39:23] <Catpurrple> It sploded away somewhere
[1:39:23] <Camail> you threw a nade at it

[1:39:37] <+TheShisno> Good ol Rawket Lawn chair
[1:39:40] <Shardlab> The guns have physics too
[1:39:44] <dankvonmemelord> flashlight
[1:39:47] <Shardlab> So it's pretty much gone

[1:40:05] <rosemon5001> the gun went full redbull
[1:40:20] <AppleBerryKitty> Ffffffffffffffffffffffff I missed a lot
[1:40:21] <%Asuterisuku> Legitimately the worst level in the game.
[1:40:25] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:40:25] <%dinnydanny777> They're with Bao Dur now
[1:40:27] <+D00msDayDan> the way with enemies shooting at you
[1:40:27] <%subjectg> a neat trick is that picking up a weapon and dropping it means it won’t despawn
[1:40:27] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:40:33] <+TheShisno> Yeah it's a bad
[1:40:38] <Mr_Taters > The Library is one of the best love-hate levels
[1:40:39] <+Slimshazbot> This level is infamous for a reason
[1:40:45] <+MidnightBurst12> blorb has abandoned you
[1:40:47] <%dinnydanny777> Bao Dur is tinkering with the Sentinels on their home planet
[1:40:48] <+TheShisno> There's an achievement specifically to speedrun this
[1:41:01] <FunkyStreams> It's a fuckin Synthetic library, what would you expect?
[1:41:10] <andrei11dr> Iea ,it's easily the worst level in the game
[1:41:11] <%dinnydanny777> teamkilling? :)
[1:41:13] <+GTCknight> I did that Achievement
[1:41:19] <%subjectg> Less than 30 minutes, on legendary no less
[1:41:22] <+GTCknight> I hated it
[1:41:23] <+EMFole> halo 1 is fairly buggy and fairly rough but man what a game
[1:41:27] <+yeeter_baelish> the way they just drop in
[1:41:29] <+How2BEpic> I believe there's an achievement for beating this level under 25 minutes on Legendary and MAYBE Heroic..
[1:41:31] <Ynkubus18> All levels have partime achievments, this level has a dont die on heroic onwards one tho
[1:41:32] <+yeeter_baelish> LMAO

[1:41:56] <%Pinkiefan> The way to do it on legendary is kite them into a group and grenade.
[1:41:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> Remember in Ghosts of Onyx where it turns out the entire planet is just a latticework of literally trillions of sentinels, with a thin layer of dirt on top?
[1:42:01] <Solidnick18> um
[1:42:01] <andrei11dr> 14-17 Explosions go bom
[1:42:03] <+TheShisno> Weapon clipping
[1:42:04] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> monkaS
[1:42:05] <%Irridium> oh, weapon stuck in the wall!
[1:42:05] <trackles_64> is this heroic?
[1:42:08] <+yeeter_baelish> yeah halo 1 is a little janky but it still goes hard
[1:42:09] <jorniev> halo was the one game I can think of we're team killing is a legitimate tactic
[1:42:11] <+D00msDayDan> @trackles_64 normal
[1:42:12] <%Chatterbox1991> fapping
[1:42:15] <%Pinkiefan> It's normal.
[1:42:17] <Nomad94> *where
[1:42:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @jorniev more games need to have trivial teamkilling, like Halo and Portal 2
[1:42:31] <Robot_Nixon_> its intended GabeN
[1:42:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Infection Forms are just the inverse of a charged shot. Minimal effect on shields but devastating to health.
[1:42:40] <+TheShisno> I like how Halo 1, a game made in 2001, has weapon floor collision sounds, and that continues when it goes into the wall
[1:42:51] <AppleBerryKitty> im pretty sure its that dead body on top in half the wall making that glitch sound
[1:43:06] <+Slimshazbot> Not having subtitles in the orignal was such a bummer because he has some interesting things to say in this level
[1:43:15] <+JingKaisean> man, this level is so monotonous
[1:43:31] <%Asuterisuku> Bungie got better at map design as the series went on.
[1:43:34] <%MrMoonGoose> Shotgun/AR is best combo
[1:43:36] <+yeeter_baelish> this level is so chill on normal LuL

[1:44:21] <+yeeter_baelish> just melee the jellyfish
[1:44:21] <AppleBerryKitty> doing this on legendary was not fun, even with shortcuts and hiding. actually them shortcuts bungie knew people would take and spawned mobs there...I hate them..
[1:44:21] <%Irridium> @LiquidDinosaur they did not
[1:44:23] <%a_goth_pancake> @asuterisuku and yet they never designed a map better than blood gulch

[1:45:46] <Nomad94> @Joestar1890 so are we
[1:45:46] <%brachydios777> The flood are necromorphs before necromorphs
[1:45:46] <Joestar1890> Vasquez is in 2, unfortunately
[1:45:46] <FunkyStreams> The Flood is wayyy different than Aliens
[1:45:46] <Griffin1171> that's cortana
[1:45:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> THEY PUT VAZQUEZ IN HALO 2
[1:45:48] <DomunDomunDomun> ".50 cal. Rockets. Didn't do a thing."
[1:45:48] <andrei11dr> And Starship Troopers

[1:45:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> YOU GET HISPANIC LADY MARINE IN HALO 2
[1:45:58] <+TheShisno> Vasquez is literally in halo 2 but we'll get to that
[1:45:58] <UnlimitedBick> SHUT THE FUCK UP GUYS
[1:45:59] <+Jessie_Lockhart> We dont even have Ripley

[1:46:44] <bleugh> yeah i never played this far mehdiCRINGE
[1:46:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> God, i still want an open world game set on a Halo. Like, imagine for a second an Arma/Battle Royale style thing just the map is a huge ring
[1:46:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> any game that could have a huge fucking map
[1:47:04] <Halospaz117> @LiquidDinosaur I mean, there is a Halo mod for Arma 3
[1:47:09] <Curtis_64> are they going to play all of them?
[1:47:11] <+D00msDayDan> it's a godsend when an elite roars at you on legendary because they're holding still for you to stick them
[1:47:17] <%tyler274> blaze it
[1:47:21] <%Tearonex> "they're not going to stop" *stops moving* LUL
[1:47:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Halospaz117 does it make the ring? i feel like that would be really hard to pull off technically

[1:52:03] <Solidnick18> @brachydios777 that is correct
[1:52:19] <%Asuterisuku> Don't click on it, Woolie.
[1:52:22] <mdkcde> They released COVID 343
[1:52:30] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Talking about old, I saw a tweet of a pepsi machine that still had the Star Wars Episode 1 facing
[1:52:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 fair enough. (oh also t would need to be smaller. Like, this ring in Halo has the surface area of Canada. )
[1:52:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Covid 343 is strong
[1:52:40] <%Will9099> did V die there?
[1:52:51] <%Gruhunchously> Look don't touch
[1:52:58] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur Agreed, it would need to be way smaller
[1:53:01] <%lotharrio> Humans in power armor, gross bug monsters and then advanced smooth looking aliens. A classic setup.
[1:53:03] <Griffin1171> make sure to watch the Keyes terminal, it's rad
[1:53:04] <%alpacasintophats> what about the 9th level terminal? that one isn't spoilers and honestly should be watched?
[1:53:04] <ThatGuyThere03> the android bus?
[1:53:05] <%dinnydanny777> I wouldn't go on a boss right now
[1:53:08] <Halospaz117> Nah, not after the incident
[1:53:10] <%dinnydanny777> bus*
[1:53:13] <eldercat> Noy here.
[1:53:14] <+EMFole> you can cancel out of the terminals if you collect them I believe
[1:53:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1277817541960876033?s=20
[1:53:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> what is in the terminals? is it even spoilers that would mean anything to Woolie? Like is it talking aout DIdact and Librarian and all that obscure shit?
[1:53:22] <%Asuterisuku> I think Bungie might have played Starcraft a few times.
[1:53:24] <%dinnydanny777> I'm dumb lol
[1:53:25] <eldercat> *not
[1:53:27] <%optimasmaximas> oh yeah
[1:53:28] <%brachydios777> Are wr gonna watch the terminals after the play through?
[1:53:30] <Solidnick18> he is a bit of strange boy

[1:54:21] <+EMFole> @liquiddinosaur no it's all about 343 GS and about the installation and stuff

[1:54:25] <marvel877> "I'm not saying it was aliens. But it was aliens."

[1:54:43] <OldOnyx> hehehehehe
[1:54:44] <+EMFole> the one on Keyes is about Keyes and what happens to him on that level
[1:54:45] <duskrush> Space popcorn were a HUGE problem
[1:54:54] <%brachydios777> @floofiie At the very least it was just him narrating
[1:54:57] <Solidnick18> when is a halo
[1:54:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @alpacasintophats but what i DO remember is that i am Keyes, Jacob, Captain, 01928-19912-JK"
[1:54:59] <MonstarGrrrl> its a wedding ring :)
[1:55:01] <Joestar1890> The halo is SOMETHING
[1:55:02] <%alpacasintophats> @LiquidDinosaur that's the one
[1:55:08] <%lotharrio> And there's plants.
[1:55:12] <Joestar1890> It's big
[1:55:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Halo is the friends we made along the way
[1:55:15] <Dean_Inbetween> Oh its soo much more..
[1:55:19] <+yeeter_baelish> the halo is...a thing
[1:55:20] <%dinnydanny777> The halo is a Halo
[1:55:26] <duskrush> It's Galactus' cockring. The flood are his STDs
[1:55:26] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp timeshares
[1:55:27] <IntrepidEye> because the creators were all up their own asses
[1:55:28] <%ringabal> Does the Halo work on Spiral Energy?
[1:55:29] <%Asuterisuku> Winter is actually a bug in the environmental maintenance.
[1:55:30] <andrei11dr> It's the thing angels got on their heads, duhh
[1:55:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> (i mean isnt there no real reason for the environment except it looks cool?)
[1:55:35] <Halospaz117> Hey, why not go on Vaction and do War Crimes at the same time?
[1:55:35] <+phatmac16> The halo is the one piece
[1:55:37] <%subjectg> this here is the hell room in legendary

[1:55:55] <+JingKaisean> man, I remember just walking in circles at this part
[1:55:56] <+Sernious> what if the halo was a giant space wedding ring
[1:56:01] <+yeeter_baelish> man I fuckin love halo
[1:56:07] <+JingKaisean> like, just wait until the boomers collect
[1:56:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ringabal the virgin Spiral Energy vs the Chad 13 year old magic girl angst energy
[1:56:14] <%brachydios777> This level is not exactly the most loved by the Halo community
[1:56:18] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> Now Thats What I Call Hold Your Position Til The Monitor Returns Vol 12
[1:56:21] <IntrepidEye> shotty has a lot more range than I remember
[1:56:25] <Solidnick18> WutFace
[1:56:26] <%Chatterbox1991> the halo truly is the final fantasy 13
[1:56:26] <%Asuterisuku> @Shinny1338 Episode 2 of the anime only just game out. You'll be waiting a while.
[1:56:28] <%dinnydanny777> I remember those guys
[1:56:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ringabal (like from madoka when tween girl drama is the ultimate power source capable of reversing entropy)
[1:56:33] <%Asuterisuku> WAtch it for V's perspective anyway.
[1:56:40] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Those are former humans
[1:56:48] <%brachydios777> It’s crazy the range on the CE shotgun
[1:56:54] <%KityLinn> the fighting is fun, in this level. It's just everything around the fighting that's bad
[1:56:56] <andrei11dr> Ewwww, you nasty!
[1:56:57] <%dinnydanny777> I appreciate the displaced nexks
[1:56:59] <%alpacasintophats> meh your life is fine
[1:57:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 its OP becausee it actually approaches realism
[1:57:03] <%DappercatEsquire> Oh we in the Library now?
[1:57:05] <AppleBerryKitty> still dont understand why snipers dont work on the floods, it that wouldn't work neither should any normal gun.
[1:57:09] <+Slimshazbot> I love the detail that the flood infection literally pushed the hosts head off to the side and grows its on sensory organs in its place because it doesn't need that shitty non-flood stuff
[1:57:10] <%alpacasintophats> try crossing any of the bridges with 1 plip on heroic or legendary
[1:57:17] <%Asuterisuku> You're playing DOOM now, Woolie.
[1:57:23] <marisot_lemonade> run and gun
[1:57:24] <+eiightbiitt> ah the mini nuke frags
[1:57:28] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Chatterbox1991 jokes on you I like final fantasy 13
[1:57:32] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur Yeah that’s the thing, actually shotguns have way more range
[1:57:45] <%alpacasintophats> @AppleBerryKitty yeah it's dumb that they don't this game but they do in other ones I think
[1:57:49] <%DappercatEsquire> Flood doin parkour and shit
[1:57:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot the first time i played 343 Guilty Spark it took me a while to realize those were elites. like i thoguth there were human flood and "pure" flood and then i happened to see a severed head with the jaw and was like "oohhhhhhh"
[1:57:51] <%JaceDarkstar> you need to use explosives to break the combat form
[1:57:52] <%dinnydanny777> The Flood are using Trickster

[2:00:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> @LiquidDinosaur i don't think so? it's been a while so i don't remember. all i know is that they built it up only to retcon it in the later games LUL
[2:00:35] <+JingKaisean> it looks like they've been going through the same thing for 30 mins
[2:00:39] <%dinnydanny777> Rocket Jumps are best Halo tech

[2:00:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheOneCalledRock wait sorry this is going fast what are you replying to?
[2:00:59] <Dean_Inbetween> That is essentially this level and why it’s considered the worst level in the franchise
[2:01:03] <OldOnyx> plasma pistal is the best overall weapon if you can twitchfire
[2:01:07] <%DappercatEsquire> I liked the pistol in Halo 2 since it just fuckin went if you were quick
[2:01:19] <Nomad94> @Dean_Inbetween Gravemind and Cortana are close runner-ups
[2:01:23] <danielmorn> Halo 1s Peeler is actually good against non shielded enemies too
[2:01:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> The time is yes
[2:01:24] <+yeeter_baelish> imagine being the first person to discover rocket jumping, "Yo I gotta tell my friends PogChamp " LuL
[2:01:24] <akman14> Time o'clock

[2:01:31] <$NitronStreams> the time is yes
[2:01:31] <Dangerzone979> The last few levels of Halo 4 really sucked
[2:01:35] <%optimasmaximas> they nerfed it cause of how good it was in this game
[2:01:36] <FunkyStreams> Dpends on you position as a hand on a clock.
[2:01:39] <drewslo> depends which way it rotates
[2:01:39] <%brachydios777> That’s a good point

[2:02:56] <Nomad94> oh right
[2:03:04] <Solidnick18> so many floods
[2:03:20] <Dean_Inbetween> They are basically an organic super computer in the form of a virus
[2:03:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @HeavyC4 well it seems for complex tasks they find people with specialized knowledge and put them into the flesh-blobs to mindrape them and harves their memories, like with Keyes, jhoping they'd find some meory of his that has Earth's coordinates
[2:03:39] <Dean_Inbetween> Quantum ai i mean
[2:03:41] <%dinnydanny777> Explaining how the Flood know things would be big spoilers

[2:13:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT CURES COVID
[2:13:41] <Explodincatz> sell shirts of it

[2:13:47] <rubbishbinge> if i don't then spiders will crawl into my mouth when i sleep
[2:13:48] <$arcielardor> Don't listen to the president
[2:13:49] <NeonBleu> what about if it's a little pesticide?
[2:13:51] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I hear pesticide stops the corona virus PogChamp
[2:13:51] <Dean_Inbetween> They specifically said sentient life so life could re evolve after a wipe @woolieversus
[2:13:51] <%VvTacoSaladvV> @liquiddinosaur ooooooohh
[2:13:52] <%alpacasintophats> @illtima because of how the flood propagates. The flood changes it's DNA signature to the host body inorder to corrupt and change it to the flood. The flood don't have a specific DNA signature and thus could not be targeted by the rings.
[2:13:52] <andrei11dr> Should've told that to Trump
[2:13:53] <%a_goth_pancake> eat plasma to immunity the fludd
[2:13:53] <+toastybites> The president told me to shoot light up my bum tho
[2:13:53] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Put it in a needle then stick the needle in your ass
[2:13:56] <startstoprepeat> not spraying pesticide in your mouth can lower your o2 saturation
[2:13:59] <%eanscrale> FYI a lot of the residue from those pesticides are still bad for you

[2:14:11] <thelonechris> I was instructed to inject bleach into my retinas
[2:14:12] <+sunsetserenity1> Did they say if they were going to play the series, or just this game?
[2:14:13] <+TheShisno> Inject Halo into your body to stop the Flood
[2:14:13] <+eiightbiitt> lol some people are so stupid many have died during this quarantine due to swallowing bottles of hand sanitizer
[2:14:15] <+paladinstarbuster> ITS OVER 8000
[2:14:15] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> it is MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to spray pesticides in my mouth
[2:14:16] <%ChoculaUltra> I really hope astronauts listen to the Halo soundtrack while they're in space
[2:14:22] <%subjectg> @halospaz117 i’m always on the lookout for funny belkan char clone

[2:14:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas ok fine, i played a fucklload of halo 1-3 growing up but i'll never pretend the story is good. the aesthetics are perfect tho
[2:14:35] <Shardlab> Welcome to the ultimate backtrack
[2:14:38] <%KityLinn> good way to recycle levels
[2:14:39] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Hey drink bleach and shoot uv light into your lungs to protect against covid-19, hey, wouldnt it be crazy if an elected official said that? wouldnt that be nuts?
[2:14:41] <Nomad94> Halo does the "same level but in reverse" thing a bunch
[2:14:42] <+TheShisno> It's the same... but not?

[2:14:47] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I prefer the Mass Effect OST for space
[2:14:47] <Solidnick18> well then
[2:14:47] <%dinnydanny777> Anyone ever seen that clip of the guy who claimed his weed killer was so safe you could drink it and the host asked him to drink it
[2:14:48] <%krispen_wa> But if we destroy Halo, what happens to Halo 2?!
[2:14:51] <zocano> Technically you weren’t *here*, you skipped passed it
[2:14:52] <IntrepidEye> Just get a new Halo
[2:14:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie you must activate Halo to defeat COVID 19
[2:14:55] <%Asuterisuku> Hey, remember what 343 said about OTHER INSTALLATIONS?
[2:14:57] <%dinnydanny777> He wouldn't drink it
[2:15:01] <huskarl_zap> da won ring
[2:15:01] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur no it makes since, im just iffed that i never noticed lol

[2:15:06] <duskrush> not everything
[2:15:07] <CursedNobleman> my condo in blood gulch! NotLikeThis
[2:15:09] <%lewdskeletor13> I think the fact that the Forerunners were willing to kill everything in the galaxy is supposed to show you what a powerful threat the Flood was
[2:15:22] <%ChoculaUltra> what if it was designed to go on a giant finger on a giant hand monkaS
[2:15:23] <Woodstock_hobbs_> ace, any takers that want to talk
[2:15:24] <FunkyStreams> It serves its purpose either way, I guess.
[2:15:25] <%krispen_wa> WAAAAAAAAGH
[2:15:26] <Teh10sorrow> Is it weird that i can't really unconnect RVB with Halo

[2:25:36] <+yeeter_baelish> halo 2 legendary is fucked up
[2:25:39] <%dinnydanny777> The boost really improves a lot of the vehicles
[2:25:41] <+RealPT1> don't really have enough buttons for all that on a controller

[2:26:23] <%black_pariah> this is one of the best songs om the OST

[2:29:24] <FunkyStreams> Shotgun Flood, the most insidious killer
[2:29:27] <+TheShisno> Terminals are gonna have to be after a while
[2:29:32] <+yeeter_baelish> they should play halo 2 on heroic
[2:29:34] <Mr_Taters > @IntrepidEye Yeah something I'm excited for with Infinite is that there's a lot of potential for a variety of factions/factions interacting
[2:29:35] <%Pinkiefan> Last level rockets are the worst.
[2:29:42] <Darth_Mama> What if flood could infect dead John bodies?
[2:29:44] <duskrush> Exploration isn't as required in Halo games. You get the guns you like and then haul ass

[2:31:58] <duskrush> I don't think Halo 1 has lock on
[2:32:00] <spacebowie749> yayap didnt die for this
[2:32:03] <%Pinkiefan> What's the score?
[2:32:03] <+yeeter_baelish> yeah the rockets are slow LuL
[2:32:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg fucking, just riding out to the desert with his lunchbox and waiting for the end of the world
[2:32:07] <Catpurrple> Where they'll be, not where they are
[2:32:12] <%PadreHail> YOU HAD ONE SHOT WOOLS
[2:32:14] <Ion_Laser> @duskrush Lock-on wasn't added until Halo 2
[2:32:17] <%Will9099> that was close
[2:32:18] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur remember that time yayap threatened zuka with a gun
[2:32:22] <Jashter18> Always two banshees
[2:32:26] <%subjectg> and succeeded?
[2:32:28] <duskrush> no more
[2:32:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> That 2nd shot was bullshit. Why would you take it?
[2:32:29] <duskrush> no less

[2:32:36] <%SuperKirby24> woolie rockets Kappa
[2:32:37] <%brachydios777> Don’t you hold down left trigger for lock on?
[2:32:43] <andrei11dr> 19-24
[2:32:45] <Ynkubus18> no lock in ce
[2:32:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg yeah, i had to remind myself its a book and a plasma pistol could concievably be a threat to an elite. like, in-game he would only get one shot and the most it could do is kill his shield
[2:32:50] <Saffry_Ruzin> Zuka boi is attacking Alpha base right about now
[2:32:51] <Ion_Laser> @brachydios777 Yeah. In Halo 2 and up
[2:32:53] <%PadreHail> Nah there's no lock on till 2
[2:32:54] <DomunDomunDomun> lock in is h2 only
[2:33:00] <%dinnydanny777> Dramatic violins
[2:33:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg at which point Zuka would tear his spine out.

[2:33:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> Except Breaking Benjamin
[2:33:43] <%PadreHail> Wha Halo 2's soundtrack is incredible
[2:33:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @jorniev he doent like the halo OST?
[2:33:49] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur yeah plasma gets toned down for the sake of gameplay balance, it’s rough in the boojs

[2:46:55] <%subjectg> @jorniev reach as an easter egg and 4
[2:46:56] <+TheOneCalledRock> how IS halo 4
[2:46:58] <%brachydios777> @jorniev Reach first technically
[2:46:58] <stayinthepocket> Who cares?
[2:47:00] <Ynkubus18> @jorniev reach does via easter eggs
[2:47:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Can’t you fly pelicans in Reaxh?
[2:47:04] <+eiightbiitt> hunters
[2:47:10] <+cowardman93> checkpointing is halo is kinda finnicky
[2:47:11] <%subjectg> halo 4 is ok, not the best, but ok
[2:47:12] <Unimpressions> Reach has the Falcons
[2:47:18] <+TheOneCalledRock> i know it isn't the quality of the bungie games but i wonder if 4 is still good
[2:47:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh yeah
[2:47:25] <andrei11dr> I like 4
[2:47:28] <UnlimitedBick> @TheOneCalledRock bad, final boss is a cutscene
[2:47:28] <%lewdskeletor13> I like 4
[2:47:32] <%brachydios777> 4 gets too much shit
[2:47:33] <jorniev> I heard halo 4 was just ok
[2:47:40] <+cowardman93> 4 is the worst of the halo games but it's still a good time
[2:47:42] <%subjectg> the story of 4 is what you’re gonna stick around for, MP is so-so
[2:47:42] <%KityLinn> it was alright
[2:47:43] <%lewdskeletor13> 5 is the real bad one
[2:47:45] <Sauceboss15> 4 was.. interesting
[2:47:45] <+GTCknight> 4 was trash for me
[2:47:45] <%prime_name> 4's campaign was the best part.
[2:47:46] <+the22cstomp> 5 is the bad one, 4 is still okay
[2:47:46] <Unimpressions> 4 is ok but its ending sequence does it no favors
[2:47:46] <%KityLinn> some good performances
[2:47:47] <%superc37> in terms of story, 4 is probably my favorite.
[2:47:47] <Zereaux> 4 desrves all the shit it gets
[2:47:48] <DFireCreations> 4 has some dumb stuff but it stands on its own
[2:47:52] <+cowardman93> I prefer 5 to 4
[2:47:52] <+attackofthesage> 5 is the worst. 4 is just bad.
[2:47:54] <ThatGuyThere03> 4 would be just kinda mediocre, but it's coming right after Reach
[2:47:57] <andrei11dr> It wasn't anything mind blowing, looked really good though
[2:48:01] <T_Sasquatch> Didn't realize people gave a fuck about halos campaigns LUL
[2:48:01] <zocano> 5 is still fine
[2:48:05] <jorniev> don't now how the multiplayer was in halo 4
[2:48:06] <marvel877> 4 was okay, but then 5 shits the bed.
[2:48:07] <IntrepidEye> 4 was good for one playthrough but doesn't have any replay value
[2:48:09] <bleugh> i remember the levels in halo4 feeling more video-game-levely, less open
[2:48:11] <%brachydios777> 5 is the black sheep in terms of story quality
[2:48:15] <FunkyStreams> and pretty soon master Chiefs!
[2:48:17] <+eiightbiitt> I think halo 5 sucked only because you have to play with Locke
[2:48:21] <Halospaz117> Hunters no way can get infected, cuz they're just worms
[2:48:22] <leroyslammin> Halo's campaigns were some of the biggest parts of Halo.
[2:48:24] <+Slimshazbot> Grunts and Jackals get made into carriers because they're to weak to make into effective combat forms
[2:48:24] <+D00msDayDan> 5's story is ass but plays SO good
[2:48:26] <duskrush> if he shoots ya, IT'S GONNA HURT
[2:48:28] <%pkdragoon> 4 was alright 5 was straight dookie
[2:48:28] <UnlimitedBick> @T_Sasquatch multiplayer was ass too
[2:48:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Little guys become exploders
[2:48:30] <stayinthepocket> H4 campaign > H5 campaign. H5 multiplayer > H4 multiplayer
[2:48:30] <Zereaux> was it 4 or 5 that had that horrible hand to hand fight?
[2:48:30] <ThatGuyThere03> 5 is probably the worst the games ever got in terms of writing
[2:48:32] <zocano> Ya story wise 5 is a hot mess but it’s still fun gameplay
[2:48:32] <AppleBerryKitty> im pretty sure the flood carriers are the grunts
[2:48:33] <+attackofthesage> Campaigns absolutely sold these games
[2:48:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> i remember 4 also having the weird weapons with the floaty orange bits and being "Oh that's dumb but also cool?"
[2:48:38] <Saffry_Ruzin> Hunters are a colony of worms, and thus aren't easily infected
[2:48:41] <%brachydios777> @zereaux 5
[2:48:44] <%superc37> @t_sasquatch ... yeah, theyre kinda the reason why chief and cortana became so popular
[2:48:45] <%SirGO0SE> BURY ME
[2:48:52] <jorniev> halo 5 sucked cause the devs did not now who master chief was
[2:48:54] <Dean_Inbetween> 5 has an awful campaign but its multiplayer is good
[2:48:54] <%krispen_wa> can't flood spores infect each individual worm?
[2:48:57] <Zereaux> 5 deserves all the shit it get 4 is fine

[2:50:10] <%superc37> yeah it was 5
[2:50:11] <FunkyStreams> Just use your BR or DMR... oh wait.
[2:50:22] <+attackofthesage> Warden fight is fun the first time
[2:50:23] <FunkyStreams> kinda baad game desing
[2:50:25] <%krispen_wa> Man, I totally forgot how much of this game was endless combat in large canyons
[2:50:28] <%DSD24> @attackofthesage @D00msDayDan Ok I remember thinking those trailers were super cool
[2:50:28] <+attackofthesage> but then he keeps coming back
[2:50:31] <%brachydios777> 5 ads wete straight lies
[2:50:31] <DFireCreations> 5 is a stinker but i enjoyed the mp
[2:50:38] <Solidnick18> gahhh
[2:50:38] <%brachydios777> *were
[2:50:39] <stayinthepocket> The problem with 5 is that literally nothing happens. It ends in the same place you start more or less.

[2:50:59] <ThatGuyThere03> 5 somehow manages to do nothing yet alienate everybody
[2:51:02] <+attackofthesage> Those ads weren't lies
[2:51:06] <+attackofthesage> Halo 3's I mean
[2:51:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Zereaux
[2:51:07] <+phatmac16> I haven’t even played 5 lol
[2:51:07] <+TheOneCalledRock> i remember the biggest complaint with 4 and 5 is that the combat was getting more COD like
[2:51:08] <Mr_Taters > 5 plays really well and is a lot fun but yeah the marketing gave it a very different impressions as to what the final story's main focus turned out to be.
[2:51:09] <Decimated_body> SourPls
[2:51:09] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 3 had the greatest advertising campaign EVER
[2:51:09] <Griffin1171> the turrets aren't actually that strong
[2:51:16] <FunkyStreams> 500 years in the future, Humanity has completely disgarded all its deiginated marksman and support roles.
[2:51:16] <Dean_Inbetween> it actually made me tear up
[2:51:21] <DFireCreations> 5 has like 12 plots going on at the same time and none of them were executed well
[2:51:25] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur But the people did think chief died in the end
[2:51:26] <Zereaux> the plot of halo 5 cortana want to bang the chef
[2:51:31] <+TheOneCalledRock> 3's ad was the one with the figurines ya?
[2:51:33] <leroyslammin> Halo 3's campaign might be the best, second to Halo 2 maybe.
[2:51:35] <%Gruhunchously> @DFireCreations Just like TLoU 2?
[2:51:37] <Catpurrple> Believe absolutely gets a pass because it was a masterpiece of an advertisement. Panned Halo 5, however, does not.
[2:51:43] <zocano> Combat and level design wise 5 is still damn good, but the story is a hot mess which is the main issue
[2:51:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 not in a fistfight with a chieftain on earth
[2:52:05] <+Slimshazbot> I prefer Halo 2's campaign
[2:52:07] <+attackofthesage> Halo 2 campaign is the most ambitious this series ever gort
[2:52:10] <+attackofthesage> got*
[2:52:13] <Sauceboss15> Halo 5 is Halo in name only. Doesnt play, act, sound, or feel like Halo what so ever
[2:52:15] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur The live action ad?
[2:52:16] <Dean_Inbetween> It was the one with the figurines and interviewing old war veterans and them having memorials to the fallen
[2:52:17] <%KityLinn> 3 is pretty great, a bit too heavy on the fan service and melodrama though
[2:52:18] <%lewdskeletor13> gort gort gort
[2:52:23] <stayinthepocket> @attackofthesage Wort
[2:52:31] <+phatmac16> Arbiter is the best
[2:52:34] <IntrepidEye> Believe was great flavor. Hunt the Truth campaign was a massive lead up to a story that didn't happen
[2:52:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> IIRC 5's sound design was pretty tight
[2:52:38] <%krispen_wa> Halo 2's story would be looked upon more fondly if it didn't end on "FINISHING THIS FIGHT"
[2:52:42] <leroyslammin> Halo 2 had my favorite player character in it, so I'm kinda biased. Wort Wort Wort forever.

[2:53:41] <+casualbaloth> little bit of come over here

[2:53:52] <+eiightbiitt> 107.1 k-hlo
[2:53:55] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s funny that Halo 2 is a great gam despite being functionally incomplete due to budget
[2:53:56] <+TheOneCalledRock> nother dumb halo question chat. when does ODST take place in the TL
[2:53:56] <+Slimshazbot> ambiguity is good.
[2:53:57] <Danny11229> remember kids, Halo 1's OST is a god damn banger
[2:53:58] <ThatGuyThere03> @Sauceboss15 If the player has to pick up a book or comic to know what's going on, you probably fucked up
[2:54:00] <%krispen_wa> Did those spartan-iis ever end up escaping that shield planet thing from the novels?
[2:54:03] <%dinnydanny777> This is such a classic snow level
[2:54:06] <alrobot2014> @TheOneCalledRock during halo 2
[2:54:09] <+Slimshazbot> @TheOneCalledRock between 2 and 3
[2:54:09] <+D00msDayDan> he didn't successfully reload either of his weapons
[2:54:09] <Dean_Inbetween> Thats also because halo 4 was rushed in 2 years and they had no concrete plan for the game except they wanted forerunner enemies until a year into development
[2:54:10] <stayinthepocket> @theonecalledrock During H2
[2:54:12] <+yeeter_baelish> halo 1s OST is god tier
[2:54:15] <%brachydios777> @lewdskeletor13 Like KOTOR 2?

[2:54:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dean_Inbetween what do you even fight
[2:54:23] <$NitronStreams> I wish halo 3 didnt have the "slowdown to a crawl and listen to cortana's diary" sections
[2:54:28] <leroyslammin> They shouldn't have explained the Forerunners at all. The lore from the Multiplayer Maps was good enough.

[2:55:12] <Sauceboss15> SEE YAH LATER FUCKERS
[2:55:13] <%heartlesshealer> Faye Valentine over here
[2:55:13] <ralphfromdk> aaaaand, DMCA'd hard
[2:55:13] <Unimpressions> One of Halo 4 and Halo 5's big errors is that they feel like sequels to a version of the original trilogy of halo games that we never got.
[2:55:15] <spacebowie749> see you later fuckers!
[2:55:16] <+Slimshazbot> Like I wanna hammer it into story writers heads, if you have a mysterious ambiguous ancient powerful race DON'T TRY TO EXPLAIN THEM
[2:55:16] <rubbishbinge> 3 2 1 let's jam
[2:55:18] <%krispen_wa> Did John Halo end up fucking Kasumi?
[2:55:20] <+TheOneCalledRock> maaan i need to watch cowboy beebop one of these days
[2:55:25] <%krispen_wa> because i'd watch that
[2:55:25] <leroyslammin> I hate Halo Legends because of what they made the female Elites look like.
[2:55:28] <vulkan_vibes> okay 3 2 1
[2:55:32] <Dean_Inbetween> @liquiddinosaur uh..sort of.. but yes basically but there origin is a bit more complicated than that
[2:55:34] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Bebop is like the realest classic
[2:55:37] <+einherjarvalk> slow down in mid air and air spawn Woolie lmao
[2:55:42] <+TheOneCalledRock> not much of a anime watcher so i keep putting it off
[2:55:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> but i keep here great things bout it
[2:55:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot is Halo 4 when they decided humans used to be equal to the forerunners
[2:55:56] <DomunDomunDomun> Truth and reconcilliation is awful for that, you keep hitting ledges during the first sniper section.
[2:56:03] <%brachydios777> Promeathian origins are halo 4 spoilers
[2:56:07] <%black_pariah> the idea that you have to read a book to understand halo 4 have been proven to be bullshit for years, every single thing about the villains origin and motive was in the cutscene dialogue
[2:56:08] <Zereaux> didnt female elites only have hair and beefers?
[2:56:09] <+wunp_fxs> ah it was soo good
[2:56:14] <AppleBerryKitty> why cant you move the camera when your dead again?
[2:56:17] <Decimated_body> Jmusic
[2:56:19] <IntrepidEye> Explaining the Forerunner was fine. Having Forerunner become major enemies was 343's big mistake
[2:56:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 who the fuck even cares about spoiling Halo 4
[2:56:24] <%StaceMcGate> The Pillows? You mean the Seatbelts?
[2:56:25] <+attackofthesage> The Pillows covered Tank?
[2:56:27] <+D00msDayDan> @LiquidDinosaur woolie definitely
[2:56:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> i'm sorry the live rendition by WHO??? I NEED TO LISTEN TO THAT
[2:56:31] <FunkyStreams> Don't worr, the uh Forerunners? give you more Banchees on the way out.
[2:56:33] <Dean_Inbetween> @liquiddinosaur they are led by a rogue forunner general who said why dont we just turn ourselves into machines to defeat the flood and the forerunners exiled him and sealed him away
[2:56:34] <+yeeter_baelish> I hate when they make female aliens look like human women
[2:56:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:56:45] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur I don’t know who cares or not
[2:56:48] <Dean_Inbetween> @liquiddinosaur because he was fucking crazy
[2:56:48] <dankvonmemelord> !uptime
[2:56:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 56 minutes
[2:56:48] <FunkyStreams> Sorry, the Guardians.
[2:56:48] <ScandalousSam262> wuss poppin
[2:56:51] <+Slimshazbot> Explaining the Forerunners is like explaining the Reapers, a shit fuking idea
[2:56:53] <+JingKaisean> @yeeter_baelish ok yes, but ass and titties tho
[2:56:59] <%krispen_wa> We're like 2 missions away from the end right?
[2:57:00] <%heartlesshealer> Woolie, PLEASE tell us when The Pillows covered Tank?!
[2:57:01] <leroyslammin> They're supposed to just be smaller more slender Elites @zereaux Kinda like the difference between lizards in Divinity Original Sin 2.
[2:57:08] <+cowardman93> you're not supposed to solve this problem
[2:57:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dean_Inbetween i assume you mean Didact? that sounds like a great plan. Can't eat what you cant digest (except the Flood can eventually learn to hack technology)
[2:57:10] <Zereaux> ah
[2:57:12] <+therabbles> the pillows @TheOneCalledRock
[2:57:14] <%KityLinn> and then the teleportation grid is never used again
[2:57:19] <+cowardman93> the halo IS the problem solver
[2:57:20] <%KityLinn> because fuck you
[2:57:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @KityLinn look she got it upsidedown, next time could be inside out
[2:57:28] <+kewlmyc> DEW IT
[2:57:29] <%a_goth_pancake> so if you want a good read, go check out 'Soma the Painter'. It's about a Forerunner artist just before the firing of Halo. Big spooky.
[2:57:32] <Halospaz117> Best mission opening time
[2:57:32] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> DEWIT
[2:57:37] <+D00msDayDan> we ran out of time, just teleport chief to the next level
[2:57:39] <bleugh> blip
[2:57:39] <%KityLinn> lol
[2:57:41] <%brachydios777> DO IT
[2:57:44] <Joestar1890> JOHN HALO IS DED

[2:57:50] <Decimated_body> SourPls
[2:57:51] <+therabbles> woolie might have confused the pillows with the seatbelt
[2:57:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> @therabbles oh i know, i was being over dramatic because that sounds like the hypest shit
[2:57:54] <leroyslammin> TEABAG THE RING
[2:57:55] <Zereaux> that bit in halo legends with spartan 1337 was cool
[2:57:55] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @jorniev
[2:57:57] <aluddss> lost the coin flip FeelsBadMan
[2:58:00] <Dean_Inbetween> @liquiddinosaur yes the didact and activision the flood still find a way to fuck with his tech which is why he becomes even more evil and kidnaps people and robotisizes them
[2:58:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> STOP THAT. YOU DON'T EVEN PHILOSOPHY
[2:58:11] <DomunDomunDomun> The thing in this level is fucking horrifying in anniversary graphics.
[2:58:12] <%krispen_wa> Look at this INFODUMP
[2:58:13] <Dean_Inbetween> @liquiddinosaur actually*
[2:58:17] <%DSD24> I remember this level
[2:58:23] <Magoloso> The concept of teleportation that kills you and copies you fills me with the biggest dread
[2:58:24] <%alpacasintophats> you MUST watch this level's terminal
[2:58:24] <Isord> FeelsBadMan this level
[2:58:24] <derap41> Ah ancient star trek debate
[2:58:27] <+yeeter_baelish> this level is cool as hell
[2:58:29] <Joestar1890> 2001 for ya
[2:58:30] <%KityLinn> lol
[2:58:31] <HyperBomb21> This is very 2000s
[2:58:33] <Unimpressions> oh god wait I've never see the Thing in this level with the anniversary graphics
[2:58:34] <Halospaz117> God I love that scene
[2:58:34] <%brachydios777> Also that thing with female elites having hair was Japan being Japan
[2:58:35] <%alpacasintophats> seriously you will regret not doing it
[2:58:36] <%zamzoph> good thing he didn't teleport into something solid
[2:58:37] <prince_johnny_> love this lvl
[2:58:38] <%KityLinn> pretty good exchange
[2:58:38] <%kyh9> The Thing
[2:58:42] <derap41> @Magoloso Yeah Wormholes are better
[2:58:46] <andrei11dr> Well, it was made in 2001
[2:58:47] <%KityLinn> also this level is totally pointless
[2:58:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> halo 2?
[2:58:49] <+yeeter_baelish> uh oh
[2:58:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> NICE
[2:58:51] <ThatGuyThere03> I'm pretty sure they just need the propulsion to work
[2:58:54] <%Chatterbox1991> watch this levels terminal
[2:58:57] <$NitronStreams> Have to get the Keys

[2:59:42] <mesamus> woolie
[2:59:42] <%krispen_wa> Termminal Watch the
[2:59:45] <Dean_Inbetween> The game had a troubled development so they had to use a shit ton of assets, THEY KEPT CHANGING THIS GAME EVERY OTHER YEAR
[2:59:47] <+TheOneCalledRock> but is the terminal THAT important?
[2:59:47] <%brachydios777> You know what’s a good way to save money? Asset reuse
[2:59:49] <+cowardman93> it always bugs me how the covenant don't stop fighting humans when the flood are around
[2:59:49] <%Chatterbox1991> term nal
[2:59:54] <mesamus> you need to jump, infinite flood spawn if you don't
[2:59:54] <%Gruhunchously> What is this Blade Runner music?
[2:59:54] <%Pinkiefan> Grenade jump across.
[2:59:58] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re not going to watch the terminals don’t even ask
[2:59:58] <+yeeter_baelish> monkaS
[2:59:59] <Saffry_Ruzin> It's an emotional Terminal
[3:00:00] <%KityLinn> don't watch the terminal! chat is full of lies
[3:00:01] <Zereaux> hey chat you think a human ever banged an elite?
[3:00:06] <derap41> @Dean_Inbetween Therefore its a terrible game 0/10
[3:00:08] <%krispen_wa> Don't need to watch the Terminal. Just tell him to read the entire novel
[3:00:13] <%KityLinn> Zereaux yes
[3:00:14] <+Slimshazbot> Dont you have to go down the hole?
[3:00:18] <+cowardman93> @Zereaux after the war ended, almost certainly
[3:00:18] <%Gruhunchously> @Zereaux Absolutely. Not a question
[3:00:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> isnt Keyes in the next room over from the entrance?
[3:00:27] <alrobot2014> QA powers activate
[3:00:32] <Darth_Mama> QAAAAAA
[3:00:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> like this is a Dark Souls level
[3:00:37] <Dean_Inbetween> @zereaux the elites are overly conservative in culture they’d probably find it disgusting
[3:00:41] <andrei11dr> @zereaux If there's a hole, USE IT
[3:00:41] <%dollarstored> shotgun has some distance on it
[3:00:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> and you're RIGHT BY THE BRIDGE
[3:00:42] <$NitronStreams> BAH DUM TSH
[3:00:44] <derap41> @Zereaux if Xcom Chimera is anything to go by yeah
[3:00:47] <Dean_Inbetween> Kinda like japan :v
[3:00:47] <%dinnydanny777> What's this level look like in Classic
[3:00:54] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The hole is the goal
[3:00:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dean_Inbetween fucking humans to own the libs
[3:00:59] <%DappercatEsquire> get in the hole shinji
[3:01:02] <%krispen_wa> What's this level look like in Gunslinger?
[3:01:02] <%KityLinn> Dean_Inbetween that implies it has to be consensual
[3:01:11] <%krispen_wa> What's this level look like in Swordmaster?
[3:01:12] <Zereaux> you but you know thered be that one degenerate tho @derap41
[3:01:15] <%dinnydanny777> Sassy Bae
[3:01:19] <Goraka91> Reminder that infection forms are fucking massive
[3:01:23] <Solidnick18> ew green goo
[3:01:27] <AppleBerryKitty> you know it's a medkit on the left of that whole which is impossible to grab.
[3:01:36] <AppleBerryKitty> hole*
[3:01:37] <+Aheg0d> Can you drink it
[3:01:37] <%lewdskeletor13> Time to grab a Doom radiation suit
[3:01:41] <iamtheTwitchghost> i've legit never heard that dialogue, i've always jumped before
[3:01:43] <%KityLinn> it's serviceable
[3:01:44] <derap41> @Zereaux Wonder if Female Brutes look nice
[3:01:45] <+How2BEpic> There was an achievement for killing all of the elites, some of which are on the other side of the hole.
[3:01:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> @dollarstored a more accurate depiction of shot guns than most game OpieOP
[3:01:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh also remember how in the novelization, the elites are like "the humans putting a glass window on their ship's bridge is so stupid and impractical it _has_ to be an intentional weakness, daring us to hit it and actually that is extremely badass and honorable
[3:01:50] <+cowardman93> considering it's 2001 the game looked insane
[3:01:50] <SirDogBear> the shotgun cure
[3:01:51] <Dean_Inbetween> Im sure someone would but it would probably be controversial in universe considering sanghelli culture and the stigma of the genocide
[3:01:53] <alrobot2014> silencer on a shotgun is the most heretical thing i've ever heard
[3:01:55] <+YabbaTroll> anton chigurgh that bitch
[3:01:56] <%Gruhunchously> Doesn't Metro 2033 has a slienced revolver
[3:02:00] <Solidnick18> it's alright
[3:02:02] <Joestar1890> Guns are loud as FUCK
[3:02:03] <ThatGuyThere03> it's mostly to lessen hearing damage
[3:02:03] <%lotharrio> It's like throwing a phonebook down on the ground.
[3:02:04] <+How2BEpic> Could be misremembering but I think so.
[3:02:07] <%KityLinn> quiet relative to regular
[3:02:08] <+YabbaTroll> very correct
[3:02:09] <huskarl_zap> It stops the echo over miles
[3:02:10] <+serpenttucker> No coutry for old men features a shotgun with a suppressor
[3:02:10] <%brachydios777> Aren’t flood spores like 4 feet tall?
[3:02:11] <%dinnydanny777> The point of a silencer is that you can't tell where it's coming from or something
[3:02:13] <%DSD24> @Gruhunchously Yes it was a good weapon
[3:02:15] <%Will9099> @LiquidDinosaur thats sick
[3:02:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah you can still hear a silencer
[3:02:24] <%VvTacoSaladvV> "And this here's the loudener!"
[3:02:26] <leroyslammin> It's a fact of biology @zereaux If it exists somebody has attempted to screw it. That tension will always snap.
[3:02:26] <FunkyStreams> kinda just highlights the sceond sound, acutally.
[3:02:26] <%Ancopro> its not goldeneye??
[3:02:26] <+The_Butterfly_Man> me and my friends start for flood level was shotgun and walk backwards
[3:02:29] <ThatGuyThere03> CUTTING IT CLOSE THERE
[3:02:30] <%SirGO0SE> V love to schut
[3:02:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dean_Inbetween wait what genocide
[3:02:32] <Zereaux> subsonic ammo for the win bois
[3:02:34] <tanarath> @woolieversus check out the welrod
[3:02:35] <huskarl_zap> Its a Suppressor
[3:02:36] <+D00msDayDan> @brachydios777 grunts are 5 feet tall, infection forms are about the size of your chest cavity
[3:02:37] <%Gruhunchously> Isn't a suppressor primarily to conceal where the shooter is firing from?
[3:02:39] <derap41> @Zereaux If you've seen it you've seen it
[3:02:39] <%TubeMan642> in Splinter Cell there was a silent shot gun
[3:02:44] <tanarath> That gun is silent
[3:02:45] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> you're actually silencing the first explosion, and if you have both a silencer and sub-sonic bullets you can get it pretty darn quiet
[3:02:46] <Joestar1890> Ah Florida
[3:02:47] <$NitronStreams> thats why its called a "Suppressor" isnt it?
[3:02:48] <%dinnydanny777> Some guns are actually silent though
[3:02:52] <Jolly_Adventurer> Oh Florida
[3:02:53] <Solidnick18> Ah florida
[3:02:53] <+EternalFire9> Subsonic rounds are a thing
[3:02:55] <+TheOneCalledRock> silencers are ment for long distance weapons?
[3:02:57] <niddron> silencer isn't a real thing, it's called a suppressor which makes sense
[3:02:59] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think>
[3:03:02] <Solidnick18> makes sense
[3:03:04] <Medevalman> suppressors bring gunfire from earspliting to tolerable, but not quiet
[3:03:06] <%heartlesshealer> florida...
[3:03:08] <+JingKaisean> what about a loudener?
[3:03:09] <%Gruhunchously> The Compensator
[3:03:10] <%KityLinn> toksheLewd
[3:03:11] <huskarl_zap> The Gau 8
[3:03:13] <%dinnydanny777> Very small guns designed in a specific way can be almost silent
[3:03:16] <%brachydios777> @d00msdaydan Thanks
[3:03:17] <%KityLinn> the penis extender
[3:03:19] <penitentpentwitch> The Compensator MUST be a two hander
[3:03:22] <legion0047> There actually is a gun that is movie silence
[3:03:22] <+serpenttucker> There is a gun literally called the "Yeet cannon"
[3:03:23] <+boomer059> compensators are attachments for guns
[3:03:26] <FunkyStreams> Basically, guns that shoot projectiles at >310m/s is the magic number for 'silenced'
[3:03:27] <+cowardman93> firing guns is super fun to do
[3:03:29] <%snakest3alth> Isn’t the
[3:03:30] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> and this attachment is for taking down police helicopters!
[3:03:33] <%brachydios777> You mean the Masamune?
[3:03:34] <DigitalJoshie> there probably is
[3:03:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:03:35] <%lotharrio> "You got your silencer, your loudener, and of course this is for shooting down police helicopters." "Oh I don't need that. ...yet."
[3:03:36] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The fecelator
[3:03:36] <andrei11dr> Just call it Big Fucking Gun
[3:03:38] <ThatGuyThere03> there are actually pieces called compensators
[3:03:40] <legion0047> It has a range of no and is about as lethal as a deringer
[3:03:40] <+boomer059> compensator's are the opposite of supressors. They make guns louder.
[3:03:43] <%Gruhunchously> The Compensator must be at least as large as the Chaingun from Doom.
[3:03:44] <Woronov> The compensator is a gun in Tales from the Bordlerands
[3:03:50] <%snakest3alth> Isn’t that the name of a gun in Sunset Overdrive?
[3:03:51] <SirDogBear> why use silencers when you can use loudeners
[3:03:52] <duskrush> compensators reduce recoil barrel jerk iirc
[3:03:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> the best borderlands gun is Bane
[3:03:55] <OldOnyx> does the the compensator have a compensator?
[3:03:58] <huskarl_zap> INHALE MTN DEW
[3:03:59] <Fang_of_Yeenoghu> What's the gun equivalent of hydraulics on a car?
[3:04:04] <%TubeMan642> In Sunset Overdrive there is a gun called the Flaming Compensater
[3:04:07] <derap41> Suppressors will be standard issue soon the reduced noise improves combat performance
[3:04:07] <tanarath> just shotgun
[3:04:09] <andrei11dr> 23-31
[3:04:11] <AppleBerryKitty> this is the part where the floor carriers spawn endless till you jump down
[3:04:13] <+TheOneCalledRock> sunset overdrive as a weapon called the compensator, it's a flamethrower with two canisters at the handle that makes it look like a giant dick
[3:04:14] <%brachydios777> DEW THE DEW
[3:04:18] <%KityLinn> very powerful
[3:04:20] <%Gruhunchously> Man, they've got Hunters figured out
[3:04:25] <+Aheg0d> Very Stronk
[3:04:26] <%brachydios777> EZ
[3:04:29] <ThatGuyThere03> shotgun beats everything
[3:04:30] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus You can interrupt the shotgun's reload btw
[3:04:34] <Rawklobstah88> shotgun = problem solver
[3:04:34] <ralphfromdk> mmm... dual smg's
[3:04:37] <%KityLinn> there's also not that many long range engagements
[3:04:40] <Floofiie> I just came back from Halo 5 Hunters and they are ridiculously hard...
[3:04:40] <%brachydios777> They fix this later
[3:04:41] <%KityLinn> like there are in halo 2
[3:04:46] <+cowardman93> hey guess what, shotguns are pretty OP
[3:04:48] <Divryne> Snipers do nothing against Flood cause the bullet just goes through the flesh.
[3:04:54] <+D00msDayDan> also, they're playing on normal which might as well be easy
[3:05:00] <OldOnyx> little V calling one of the better weapons a bad gun
[3:05:00] <SirDogBear> best gun is obviously needler CorgiDerp
[3:05:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> i miss Halo 2 hunters being on the elite side of the civil war
[3:05:01] <AmericanaRed> THE DEW !! mwkGasm
[3:05:05] <derap41> @Fang_of_Yeenoghu Look up Mosin Bubba
[3:05:12] <+cowardman93> they balanced the pistol so much in Halo 2 it became the worst
[3:05:13] <tanarath> rifle is better the san the pistol at point blank
[3:05:26] <CurrySauseBandit> AR is fine as a bullet hose. Ran tbrough Leg with AR
[3:05:26] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur Some still are but you don’t see them in 3
[3:05:26] <Mr_Taters > @LiquidDinosaur That's definitely one of my favorite moments in the series
[3:05:27] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> just don't die lol

[3:05:41] <AmericanaRed> lmao
[3:05:42] <Joestar1890> @AmericanaRed So THIS is where the Mountain Dew Halo sponsorship comes from!
[3:05:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @cowardman93 i mean the reason is they said "Halo 1 has a rifle that acts like an SMG and a pistol that acts like a rifle, so lets just make a smg and a rifle"
[3:05:44] <+yeeter_baelish> monkaS
[3:05:49] <+Aheg0d> monkaS
[3:05:50] <Solidnick18> hold me monkaS
[3:05:51] <tanarath> otherwise, it's shotgun/pistol or plasma/pistol
[3:05:52] <SailingSaturn> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug cirSmug cirBox
[3:05:57] <+GTCknight> There are no bad guns in CE
[3:05:59] <derap41> Ah Spooky music
[3:06:01] <JetpackMcQuack> Strings monkaS
[3:06:02] <+serpenttucker> halo 4 assault rifle is the best variant of the assault rifle, in that you could reasonably use it for legendary
[3:06:03] <AppleBerryKitty> wow that music got loud
[3:06:08] <+The_Butterfly_Man> I mean shotgun and plasma on legendary is strong
[3:06:09] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sailingsaturn cirHi
[3:06:10] <Zereaux> elites are from a reptilian genus right?
[3:06:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> Also i think Halo 2 is being a COWARD when it doesnt make you fight humans as the arbiter
[3:06:15] <duskrush> the inmates are running the asylum
[3:06:19] <derap41> Dual Needler is still best weapon
[3:06:20] <%Gruhunchously> Wait, where's all this coolant coming from?
[3:06:22] <Joestar1890> I'm not having fun anymooore, mom please pick me up I'm scared
[3:06:31] <+yeeter_baelish> dual needler is disgusting
[3:06:32] <thelivingglitch307> Argonians
[3:06:33] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur Lil bit
[3:06:50] <+cowardman93> @LiquidDinosaur never heard that before but it makes sense. I just hope we see the silenced SMG from ODST come back again
[3:06:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> Also can we agree the best elite uniform is the Heretics? Because they arent even wearing "armor" they're basically just blue collar mine operators in work uniforms,?
[3:06:50] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @gruhunchously the giant crashed ship right above them
[3:06:51] <derap41> @yeeter_baelish You take that back! Or I'll Needle you
[3:06:58] <stayinthepocket> @gruhunchously Probably the extremely large ship hovering above them
[3:06:59] <Joestar1890> @Gruhunchously It's coming from the Truth and Reconciliation, which is right above them
[3:07:03] <%SirGO0SE> remember, red = ded
[3:07:07] <%DSD24> Didn
[3:07:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> wait never mind i was wrong. the compensator in sunset overdrive is just a big shotgun what can set people on fire and it looks like a dick
[3:07:10] <alrobot2014> isn't this the truth and reconciliation?
[3:07:13] <%Gruhunchously> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Oh
[3:07:17] <Ynkubus18> @LiquidDinosaur its certainly up there in the coller designs
[3:07:18] <Joestar1890> @alrobot2014 Yes
[3:07:19] <%DSD24> Didn't the Heretics have cool goggles?
[3:07:20] <%brachydios777> @alrobot2014 Yep
[3:07:33] <%brachydios777> Yep

[3:07:52] <+Buzzkill983> Good Tech, Good Tech
[3:07:52] <%SirGO0SE> you did it tho!
[3:07:53] <Joestar1890> The flood would be infected by THE WAY

[3:08:09] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @generalscpatton the flood can't kill you if you immolate yourself
[3:08:10] <+cowardman93> biomass
[3:08:11] <Zereaux> rip and tear
[3:08:14] <%lewdskeletor13> This is the way
[3:08:15] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur This is true
[3:08:18] <HyperBomb21> monkaS
[3:08:24] <Dean_Inbetween> Oh boy
[3:08:32] <derap41> You'd think the Flood Would figure out animal husbandry
[3:08:33] <Dangerzone979> I would hope that Cando would get the Stukov from starcraft treatment
[3:08:37] <Joestar1890> Same level but everything is FUCKED
[3:08:44] <AppleBerryKitty> dood me and my friend still havent got off truth on laso.
[3:08:45] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @lotharrio less "war crime" and more "galaxy scale extinction event"
[3:08:52] <+yeeter_baelish> yeah but its works in this case
[3:08:53] <%Gruhunchously> 14 months
[3:08:55] <duskrush> halo reverse rebirth
[3:08:55] <%Gruhunchously> Wait...
[3:08:56] <HyperBomb21> but now its spoopy
[3:09:01] <%KityLinn> "guys we ran out of money and we need to release this game in 4 months.."
[3:09:02] <%lotharrio> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Right, so the BIGGEST war crime?
[3:09:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug technically still a war crime OpieOP
[3:09:09] <stayinthepocket> lionBlind
[3:09:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Halo 2 is very DMC4 also

[3:09:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 but i was just playing Kotor 1 the other day and in Dantooine when the farmer is like "mandos attacked my farm and killed (and implicitly raped) my daughter" Canderous is like "You should have protected her better. And you call yourself her father" (you know, 1 farmer protecting her from a squad of heavily armed mandos in full plate armor)
[3:09:37] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:09:37] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @lotharrio I mean its only a war crime if it happens during a war

[3:10:04] <+Freeborg23> Woolie's got this
[3:10:07] <%SirGO0SE> oh i guess i heard that wrong LUL @dinnydanny777
[3:10:07] <%Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur Really, Cando and Kreia have more in common than either would care to admit.
[3:10:12] <%krispen_wa> Is the Arbiter just the Vergil of Halo?
[3:10:12] <stayinthepocket> @yeeter_baelish Who's the more blind Canadian? Woolie or the Egg?
[3:10:14] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Gotta keep an eye on the motion tracker. lol
[3:10:18] <derap41> Man these grunts are just having the worst luck aren't they
[3:10:19] <+yeeter_baelish> yes
[3:10:21] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur Oof
[3:10:23] <Joestar1890> I would say those poor covvies, but then I remember Reach
[3:10:24] <StarlitStunner> Demi fiend for DMC 6 @dsd24
[3:10:25] <Shardlab> Oh I remember the novel detailing this. The rest of the marines hijacked a Covenant ship and almost took it back to Earth. But one guy noticed Flood hiding in the walls and self-destructed the ship.
[3:10:34] <Ignorableartist> No Arbiter is the Lady of Halo
[3:10:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:10:37] <twieetcha> Ryan Gary is much more blind
[3:10:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Cando and Kriea are both well written but it doesn’t stop me from hating both of them lmao
[3:10:40] <%DSD24> @StarlitStunner Oh man that would be so hype
[3:10:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously yeah if she'd she'd get over her sense of smug superiority towards everyone, (and hypocritically, especially to non-force users) they'd be straight up friends
[3:10:53] <Woodstock_hobbs_> alien invasion
[3:10:54] <Solidnick18> Just goooo
[3:10:57] <%Calek> at least Normal mode isn't free
[3:10:57] <Solidnick18> get out
[3:10:57] <AppleBerryKitty> i love the funny dialogue in this game, its all funny more so the grunts
[3:10:59] <vaderxyz1970> I hear "Rowdy Strike!"
[3:11:00] <Joestar1890> @Ignorableartist Who's Vergil, then?
[3:11:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur But the only moral imperative is that you should be able to win against impossible odds and if you can't then fuck you. Shoulda fought harder.
[3:11:16] <niddron> pull out chief!
[3:11:17] <%Gruhunchously> Never Pull oUt
[3:11:18] <+TheOneCalledRock> I am just waiting for the day we get Devil Sword Virgil
[3:11:19] <Joestar1890> NEVER
[3:11:22] <Mechazoic_Era> Kupo
[3:11:22] <+yeeter_baelish> pulling out is for cowards
[3:11:22] <%SirGO0SE> the never pullout king

[3:11:25] <%krispen_wa> Yo that Elite armor is sick
[3:11:28] <HyperBomb21> The Flood really changes the feel of the game compared to the covenant
[3:11:28] <niddron> Pull out king 117
[3:11:30] <+Aheg0d> only cowards pullout
[3:11:30] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> all internal here cap!
[3:11:30] <Solidnick18> i can't pull out SIR
[3:11:30] <%DSD24> We pull in
[3:11:31] <%Will9099> pulling out is a cowards game
[3:11:31] <%KityLinn> once he's inside he never pulls out
[3:11:32] <FunkyStreams> John needed a coop buddy
[3:11:35] <Woodstock_hobbs_> just a hurt that dosn't heal
[3:11:53] <Woodstock_hobbs_> can't hear a thing and could say all the cursed words
[3:11:54] <%lewdskeletor13> @generalscpatton Yeah that’s just justification for a squad of heavily armed guys to raid a lone farmer lmao. It’s stupid
[3:12:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton I think that aspect of Kriea's philosophy is the most important part. Because at first you're like "ok you might have a point" but then "wait no fuck you you're going way too far, its ok to help someone if they'll literally die and not be able to learn from an experience"
[3:12:04] <+D00msDayDan> wait, is this a different ship? i always thought this was the truth and reconciliation still
[3:12:07] <huskarl_zap> This is the second last level isn't it?

[3:16:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> i thought in this you can use fuel rod guns
[3:16:35] <+attackofthesage> In multiplayer you can use them
[3:16:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> gun

[3:16:52] <+casualbaloth> wet meat slap .exe
[3:16:54] <%raven_frame> Keyes gets laid in the terminal.
[3:16:55] <+attackofthesage> Fuel rod cannons kinda suck anyways
[3:16:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @liquiddinosaur Just snack on all the memories until you find where planets are.
[3:16:57] <%lotharrio> Right, the Covenant have anti OSA.
[3:16:57] <derap41> @sonofthedeepsouth You like em?
[3:17:02] <%subjectg> so the best part of the spec op bois is that they drop a shitton of grenades, making some hilarious chain reactions
[3:17:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> I love Em
[3:17:07] <+JeluxDaCasual> The Voice talks to Keys is [Redacted] from a game he HASN't PLAYED, Terminal is NOT safe.
[3:17:09] <Woodstock_hobbs_> yeah em is good
[3:17:11] <%prime_name> Oh boi Duknukum

[3:17:38] <%Gruhunchously> Wasn't an earlier version of the game literally ripping Keyes' skull out his head, and that's where the skull item in multiplayer comes from?
[3:17:51] <BurdRightsActivist> @Gruhunchously Nah
[3:17:55] <Djinnazz> no
[3:17:57] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @huskarl_zap
[3:17:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton i mean, the entire point of Assassins Creed 1 was they were trying to get to the memory of Altair looking at the hologram globe

[3:18:36] <+RealPT1> Woolie would be so free to TF2 Spies
[3:18:39] <+JeluxDaCasual> None of these Ternimals are meant for anyone playing their first time through the series
[3:18:41] <Lemonbop> !uptime
[3:18:41] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 18 minutes
[3:18:57] <%krispen_wa> CAMERA GLITCH
[3:19:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> What happens when you look at a terminal? is i tjust text or video
[3:19:05] <alrobot2014> video
[3:19:07] <%KityLinn> it's video
[3:19:08] <%anita_dickin> The Maw is next right?
[3:19:08] <%krispen_wa> You die because of spoilers
[3:19:11] <+JeluxDaCasual> These in this game are videos
[3:19:11] <+Wootwi> fun fact early design of halo were 3rd person
[3:19:14] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur Video
[3:19:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh and in co-op does it pause for the other person?
[3:19:20] <zocano> Yes @anita_dickin
[3:19:27] <Shardlab> Fuel rod guns
[3:19:33] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Grunts: Dangerous little men
[3:19:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Wootwi Originally it was gonna be an RTS, but they decided to scrap it and just make a game where you were a power armored unit they made fo rit
[3:19:36] <+JeluxDaCasual> yes, everyone watches the video
[3:19:37] <%PadreHail> I'd love a third person Halo spinoff
[3:19:38] <tanarath> @liquiddinosaur They need the captain's auth codes to blow the pillar off autumn
[3:19:38] <Woodstock_hobbs_> still. maybe i should explore simply because the weapon is in my teeth
[3:19:41] <+Solutha> grunts are expendable
[3:19:46] <%raven_frame> It may be odd, however I find that this turns into a rock, paper, scissors situation. Where Flood beats Covenant, and Chief beats Flood.
[3:19:46] <%brachydios777> @liquiddinosaur I assume it plays for them also
[3:19:47] <%KityLinn> GG
[3:19:47] <derap41> 10/10
[3:19:55] <%KityLinn> totally what happened
[3:19:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> 4 PLAYER PLAY THROUGH
[3:20:02] <%Will9099> YEYEYE
[3:20:04] <FunkyStreams> All the stuttering and glitches is caused from the players getting further and further away from the start of the level. It's something modders of the OG Halo engines have struggled dealing with.
[3:20:06] <+TheShisno> YO WE ALREADY HERE

[3:20:14] <Woodstock_hobbs_> stupid internet
[3:20:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> I just realized that what Keyes does with the implant is basically just a mental Royal Guard while he's on the magic pixel.

[3:29:04] <Joestar1890> Tsun is the opposite of sass
[3:29:06] <+greatgetter> Aren't tsuns just abusive
[3:29:10] <%zamzoph> Cortana's sass was really in vogue in 2001
[3:29:11] <Woodstock_hobbs_> i was at the race track. betting on horses carving shot guns
[3:29:13] <whatatkins> tsun is just mean
[3:29:16] <SirDogBear> floating AI orbs are the worst in Halo BibleThump

[3:29:27] <+attackofthesage> Bayo sass is good
[3:29:27] <$NitronStreams> Cortana has sitcom sass
[3:29:27] <ThatGuyThere03> That has more to do with her brain "donor" being a massive asshole
[3:29:27] <%a_goth_pancake> no she doesn't.
[3:29:28] <Joestar1890> Bayo is REAL GOOD sass
[3:29:28] <+Bluemanzee> Tsun is a personality disorder
[3:29:29] <+TheShisno> That's a fat nade

[3:31:13] <%krispen_wa> I can't believe Woolie went from casually murdering Hunters last session to this
[3:31:15] <Vex_Machina> PogChamp
[3:31:16] <OldOnyx> Marty O'Johnell
[3:31:25] <%raven_frame> Oh that's right, this is a 343 remaster of a Gear Box port of a Bungie Xbox Original game.
[3:31:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh also fun fact: on that mirror'd room by the cryo-bay in New Graphics it reveals that the other room indeed has Linda in it
[3:31:34] <penitentpentwitch> The Rust Factor is strong in The Woolie Hole
[3:31:37] <saltysmyth> NibbaBruh
[3:31:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:31:44] <+ElectricFoxLex> Woolie doesn't actually know the weakpoint on Hunters, does he?
[3:31:50] <%Gruhunchously> Maybe the true Halo: Combat Evolved, The Master Chief Collection was inside us all along.
[3:31:57] <+TheOneCalledRock> so does HAlo 2 also have the classic/remastered graphics or is it just 1
[3:32:03] <+Slimshazbot> He knows
[3:32:03] <+attackofthesage> He was hitting it consistently last session
[3:32:04] <%anita_dickin> hes just aiming a little too low
[3:32:05] <%KityLinn> halo 2 also
[3:32:05] <FunkyStreams> If the covenant didn't weigh down the Hunters with all the armor and weapons, they'd be amuch more formiddable threat.
[3:32:07] <%PadreHail> 2 has it too
[3:32:07] <%krispen_wa> Halo 2 has even BETTER remastered grpahics
[3:32:10] <slatersev> Woolie shoots Hunters in the leg like he thinks its there face
[3:32:10] <+jahansoundsystem> Halo 2 has it also
[3:32:14] <%brachydios777> @theonecalledrock Yes
[3:32:15] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 2 has both
[3:32:16] <%PadreHail> They might do it for 3 but I'm not sure
[3:32:16] <Unimpressions> 2's remaster is better
[3:32:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @FunkyStreams and then they'd also be shot more easily
[3:32:23] <%anita_dickin> shooting them in the ass/thighs
[3:32:24] <FunkyStreams> At least in more open enviroments
[3:32:25] <slatersev> Halo 2 has Breaking Benjamin
[3:32:29] <slatersev> the best
[3:32:30] <DomunDomunDomun> Halo 2's remastered graphics are my favourite in the franchise.
[3:32:31] <+Slimshazbot> Halo 2 Anniversay does the orginal art style much more justice
[3:32:31] <stayinthepocket> H2A is fucking gorgeous
[3:32:39] <%krispen_wa> Fuck, Breaking Benjamin is the epitome of mid 2000s
[3:32:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> damn these mfs got hops
[3:32:45] <FunkyStreams> Where they were taught to disperse, then reassimilate.
[3:32:46] <slatersev> H2A doesnt have Benjamin
[3:32:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot yeah i think this changes a bit too much. Like, at least keep the same color palette and lighting levels?

[3:39:27] <Dean_Inbetween> @subjectg that probably makes it EVEN WORSE, i wonder if it would be enough to crash the game
[3:39:27] <%raven_frame> They want to build that style meter though.
[3:39:29] <+SashaStarshine> @LiquidDinosaur Ah fair enough

[3:40:09] <%brachydios777> Choose GUN
[3:40:14] <%Gruhunchously> WTF
[3:40:14] <+TheOneCalledRock> @arcielardor contains plot points and context for events that happen later in the game related to the current level
[3:40:14] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:40:15] <+SashaStarshine> MonkaS
[3:40:15] <marisot_lemonade> invisible flood
[3:40:19] <+D00msDayDan> woolie and a half-loaded needler, name a more iconic duo
[3:40:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> And this is about where that infection form gets Chief I think.
[3:40:26] <+TheOneCalledRock> later in the series*
[3:40:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> I WOULD ALWAYS SKIP THIS ROOM BECAUSE I COULD NOT DEAL WITH THE CONCEPT OF INVISIBLE FLOOD
[3:40:37] <%KityLinn> flood is smort
[3:40:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> they learned the secret moves
[3:40:41] <AppleBerryKitty> sad this is the only part of the game you only see this flood..
[3:40:41] <%DappercatEsquire> @WoolieVersus They're not dumb
[3:40:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus you're semi-there. or, sometimes
[3:40:49] <DigitalJoshie> maybe they pressed the button by accident
[3:40:50] <+SashaStarshine> They found a strategy guide
[3:40:50] <duskrush> they learn the abilities of their host. That's why some of them can use guns
[3:40:52] <%tyler274> YOU ARE AWARE
[3:40:52] <stayinthepocket> smrt flud
[3:40:52] <slatersev> Ask Jenkins
[3:40:53] <+Freeborg23> Pretty sure the Flood are sentient
[3:40:53] <Ynkubus18> Im never in that room long enough
[3:40:54] <%black_pariah> FLOOD ARE SMART
[3:40:55] <slatersev> it sucks
[3:40:57] <%prime_name> Shotguns behind you
[3:41:00] <%JaceDarkstar> no you are aware
[3:41:01] <%anita_dickin> Rocket
[3:41:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Woolie just NOT SEEING THE WEAPONS
[3:41:02] <AppleBerryKitty> @LiquidDinosaur I can safly say we've all done this for said reason
[3:41:03] <+Slimshazbot> Remember, they said the flood were REPAIRING THIS SHIP, they're not totally brainless.
[3:41:03] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I'm like 90% sure they're all there
[3:41:05] <+yeeter_baelish> they absorb whatever the host knows
[3:41:05] <Dean_Inbetween> No they are completely sentient
[3:41:05] <diegoleaobr> Rocket launcher rejected
[3:41:07] <%tyler274> your personality gets wiped except when it doesnt
[3:41:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> "See, your friend is only halfway dead."
[3:41:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG AWARE
[3:41:11] <Nomad94> Flood are sentient, their hosts are dead
[3:41:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @AppleBerryKitty like whatever grenades work too
[3:41:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Is the flood being aware spoilers?
[3:41:14] <Saffry_Ruzin> UNLESS YOU'RE JENKINS, then shit's fucked
[3:41:14] <ThaSparren> Flood steal all your knowledge
[3:41:14] <%raven_frame> Halo 2 is going to be sick.
[3:41:21] <%ozzrabbit> They’re all still there, and they’re aware.
[3:41:23] <angriestman> THERE'S SHOT GUNS ON THE WALL
[3:41:25] <%black_pariah> the game has been telling you flood are intelligent for 4 levels
[3:41:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tyler274 it was implied Jenkins had a weaker infection form that couldnt completely overwrite his brain
[3:41:28] <Nomad94> @MyNameIsRasus no, because the Guilty Spark mentioned it
[3:41:30] <Dean_Inbetween> No you are actually entirely alive
[3:41:30] <Saffry_Ruzin> they're not always aware
[3:41:32] <Who_lio42> never realized how many shells that shotgun actually holds
[3:41:32] <%Gruhunchously> Light Fuse
[3:41:34] <+Aheg0d> Weapon racks on the walls LUL
[3:41:34] <Who_lio42> its kinda silly
[3:41:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tyler274 so hopefully for most they're dead
[3:41:35] <%tyler274> I read all the books
[3:41:36] <%tyler274> I know
[3:41:38] <%Gruhunchously> Run Away
[3:41:39] <MyNameIsRasus> oh yeah he super did
[3:41:40] <Hellarussian> I always thought the Needler was the coolest weapon design
[3:41:41] <%alpacasintophats> there was shotgun ammo on the wall but that hardly matters now
[3:41:44] <+ygernesfeld> I cannot wait for Woolie to reach that one particular character in Halo 2.
[3:41:46] <+whiskeybuisness> halo's chapter titles were so good
[3:41:48] <Dean_Inbetween> They keep you alive so they have your memories
[3:41:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Aware until memories are all eaten?
[3:41:58] <Saffry_Ruzin> Most of the time they're dead, sometimes their alive if their unlucky
[3:42:03] <+TheOneCalledRock> wow that it s DIFFERENCE
[3:42:04] <+Killyko> In 'the halo: the flood novel, Jenkins is conscious the whole time he's infected.
[3:42:05] <Nomad94> *they're
[3:42:08] <%Gruhunchously> Hey, it's VEGA all over again
[3:42:08] <FunkyStreams> pretty simple task here. Just blow up a multi quadrillion dollar starship.
[3:42:10] <$roguemerc69> "the flood are gonna fill this starship with food and fly away" woolie when they use covenant cloaks: "They can use technology?" dicLUL
[3:42:14] <@Menitta> jeez the needler was ugly
[3:42:14] <BurdRightsActivist> hMMM Wouldn't it be cool if we could shoot him? 4Head 4Head
[3:42:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton for Jenkins it wasnt eating his memory he was just dealing with being a horrible monster but could mostly control his body
[3:42:21] <%tyler274> flood uses a "high frequency sound" like thing that drains the host's mind and tunes them out
[3:42:23] <BurdRightsActivist> @Menitta like u
[3:42:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:42:25] <%subjectg> you can shoot 343 and he has funny things to say
[3:42:29] <%KityLinn> too much cheek
[3:42:30] <%tyler274> sometimes it doesnt take and they stay totally aware
[3:42:32] <@Menitta> wow rude
[3:42:32] <OverlordLuna> Exposed Shaft Kreygasm
[3:42:33] <tanarath> The Flood was a bad book, though

[3:42:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton the marines capture him and he manages to convince the marines to blow up the Truth and Rec because its not worth escaping the ring on an infested ship

[3:44:02] <dellis80> is this the Collection edition or the stand alone reboot?
[3:44:04] <+einherjarvalk> who was it that Jen accused of putting "Wildcat" in the script? she said it in the outtakes
[3:44:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 3 is coming in july/august
[3:44:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously some classification of reactor meltdown i guess
[3:44:05] <%subjectg> it’s like some sort of puma
[3:44:07] <Jolly_Adventurer> Woolie's greatest enemy: platforming
[3:44:08] <stayinthepocket> @gruhunchously The worst football offense
[3:44:09] <%raven_frame> Grenades are the cutscene Master Chief eay.
[3:44:09] <+einherjarvalk> I think it was Joe Staten
[3:44:12] <%R3Roundabout> This is Game Grumps levels of incompetence

[3:44:23] <dankvonmemelord> crouch jump
[3:44:29] <marvel877> Is Woolie still using his... "unique" control setup?

[3:44:31] <Djinnazz> lol Wooliegrumos
[3:44:33] <+yeeter_baelish> please woolie is never that bad

[3:44:36] <%black_pariah> woolie go up the other stairs youre not good at jumping
[3:44:37] <penitentpentwitch> "Hey I'm jump!" "I'm not so jump!"
[3:44:40] <%anita_dickin> No just controller
[3:44:41] <diegoleaobr> This must be the work of an enemy stand
[3:44:42] <Profmcstevie> This is rather finicky your first time
[3:44:42] <gabrielqwerty020> Use the door
[3:44:57] <+TheOneCalledRock> i am actually curious about ODST because i never hear anyone talk about it
[3:44:57] <KityLinn> got em!
[3:45:06] <marvel877> Frogblast the vent core, Woolie.
[3:45:09] <Saffry_Ruzin> ODST is good
[3:45:10] <%brachydios777> Nice
[3:45:11] <+MidnightBurst12> ODST is great
[3:45:11] <Mr_Taters > Yeah the platforming/jumping in 1 is definitely not as responsive feeling as 2 or 3
[3:45:12] <%raven_frame> ODST is great.
[3:45:15] <XeroSigmaPrime> ODST is fuckin great
[3:45:16] <DFireCreations> ODST is the jazz game
[3:45:19] <Profmcstevie> God do I have strong memories of this sequence on Legendary
[3:45:20] <+tealplague> ODST is great 👍
[3:45:21] <Xiangchang> ODST's got the most unique Bungie soundtrack.
[3:45:21] <diegoleaobr> Love ODST
[3:45:21] <Ion_Laser> ODST is really good with a great soundtrack
[3:45:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[3:45:23] <Ynkubus18> @TheOneCalledRock its a great spin on the formula
[3:45:23] <+D00msDayDan> there's a custom edition map that's this room with marines on one side and flood on the other spawning endlessly, it's a pretty good time
[3:45:24] <marvel877> What about Mirror's Edge?
[3:45:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheOneCalledRock it was the first one with horde mode. And of course you have no shields and are weaker since you're just a normal human
[3:45:26] <DigitalJoshie> ODST it awesome
[3:45:26] <%raven_frame> It may even be my favourite.
[3:45:27] <Kain5707> LUL
[3:45:27] <stayinthepocket> *jazz intensifies*
[3:45:30] <skyheys> Metroid Prime lp when
[3:45:30] <%Gruhunchously> The only things I know about ODST is That Trailer, Nathan Fillion, and Jazz.
[3:45:32] <%Kazuhira_Boat> ODST best Halo
[3:45:33] <%Firststrike_OW> ODST is great 🎷
[3:45:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> SAME
[3:45:34] <Nomad94> @TheOneCalledRock you are much more of a glass cannon there and the campaign's not all that exciting, but I like it
[3:45:35] <DigitalJoshie> is awesome*
[3:45:36] <Unimpressions> ODST is interesting because its gameplay loop feels like a prototype to Destiny's open world format
[3:45:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> I CANT DEAL WITH MARIO.
[3:45:38] <Explodincatz> same, Mario is overatted
[3:45:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:45:39] <iamtheTwitchghost> i have the same problem with mario
[3:45:40] <SirDogBear> what about Mirrors Edge?
[3:45:42] <+Freeborg23> Most people are bad at fps platforming
[3:45:42] <%brachydios777> ODST is short but great
[3:45:43] <%SirGO0SE> mario hard :(
[3:45:44] <+D00msDayDan> fun fact, the song playing right now is called "the gun pointed at the head of the universe"
[3:45:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HERESY V
[3:45:52] <%alpacasintophats> ODST is my second favorite halo game preceded by Halo 2. Although that's primarily because 2 was my first

[4:06:12] <Hammatime8> Okay, what is this architecture?
[4:06:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @krispen_wa i dunno. someone dumb enough to put a glass window on the bridge. instead of putting the bridge in the deepest part of the ship

[4:08:01] <alrobot2014> you can't be gentle with the warthog
[4:08:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously they interpret the glass window and putting the bridge on the nose as humans going "well, what is it?!" with their ship design

[4:20:47] <Halospaz117> Fall of Reach actually came out before CE
[4:20:47] <slatersev> 2
[4:20:48] <prince_johnny_> Same
[4:20:49] <+D00msDayDan> fall of reach came out like a week before ce, the flood and first strike were after
[4:20:49] <%Javaa01> It came out 2000
[4:20:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @black_pariah i mean to be fair it was fucking STUPID to think "nah well just try our best to clean out this ship and every possible crevice of species-destroying parasites, it's safe to fly off in this
[4:20:51] <Goraka91> I got in with 3 so I have no idea
[4:20:51] <%RioGascar> Bungie actually did think halo 1 would bomb cause man they had went through hell for halo 1
[4:20:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fall of Reach came out 2 weeks before Halo 1.
[4:20:57] <+DACH33ZMAN> My mom wouldnt let me play halo when it came out :(
[4:20:59] <IntrepidEye> Book game like a month before CE
[4:20:59] <zocano> Fall of Reach released before Halo 1
[4:21:00] <Saffry_Ruzin> Fall of Reach came out before CE
[4:21:01] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Fall of Reach was right before the game, then the books followed
[4:21:02] <+TheShisno> Fall of Reach in October 2001, Halo CE in November, First Strike, Halo 2
[4:21:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @black_pariah wait why were the humans trying to fix the covenant ship and the covenant trying to fix the human ship
[4:21:04] <Shardlab> Fall of Reach was a damned good book
[4:21:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Fall of Reach came out before the first game
[4:21:10] <Melchior_the_Wise> Fall of Reach was great
[4:21:11] <+brutushypocriticus> books fall of reach, the flood, first strijke in that order
[4:21:12] <%brachydios777> Books before 2
[4:21:13] <+TheOneCalledRock> FUN FACT CHAT. the guest character that appears in DOA4 is not actually John Halo but a different spartan!
[4:21:14] <marvel877> 1, first three books, 2 and then those books got big retcons because of 2.
[4:21:15] <Ion_Laser> The Fall of Reach book came out October 2001. Halo CE came out November 2001
[4:21:16] <+D00msDayDan> fact checking will ruin this stream
[4:21:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Halo First Strike came out like right before 2
[4:21:22] <alrobot2014> Halo 2 had the I Love Bees ARG
[4:21:29] <Melchior_the_Wise> and Contact Harvest gives johnson some backstory

[4:22:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheOneCalledRock yeah and she's sent back in time by a slipspace anomaly, and the excuse for her melee fighting is she needs to protect UNSC technology but she doesnt want to kill anyone who winds up being someone's great great great great great grandfather

[4:22:43] <%subjectg> Oh if you like the aliens...
[4:22:49] <+Slimshazbot> 2's a big step up IMO
[4:22:52] <thealientrilogy> Halo 2, next week?
[4:22:53] <%subjectg> Just you wait
[4:22:54] <%Will9099> THE MAW
[4:22:55] <+TheOneCalledRock> @LiquidDinosaur isn't she 100% not canon?
[4:22:56] <HereComestheChief> I was there for the shutdown! BibleThump
[4:22:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieOMG woolieVS Halo Multiplayer when??
[4:22:57] <%lewdskeletor13> 2 is real good
[4:22:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> @krispen_wa I wish. Haloid yuri will have to do.
[4:23:02] <%LozsCat> Ill still say Halo 5 is like DMC2
[4:23:03] <+DACH33ZMAN> Halo Music Kreygasm
[4:23:06] <Snakes_dk> also epic feeling for its time
[4:23:06] <%optimasmaximas> ONLINE??? PogChamp
[4:23:09] <%RioGascar> Halo 2 single player is alright and good step up
[4:23:09] <%krispen_wa> Are we gonna eat some Halo-Halo next week?
[4:23:10] <prince_johnny_> Best soundtrack
[4:23:12] <DigitalJoshie> she's 50% cannon
[4:23:12] <%RioGascar> But the multiplayer
[4:23:16] <%lewdskeletor13> A Salt Party halo death match would be fun
[4:23:17] <%superc37> just wait until they do it again like 2 more times
[4:23:17] <%RioGascar> Holy shit halo 2 mp
[4:23:17] <RunningNGunning> You can tell which levels Bungie cared about and which they really didn't
[4:23:20] <unclekulikov> MMMM Red Faction.
[4:23:20] <+wunp_fxs> its a nice punctuation
[4:23:22] <mdkcde> back when games had ACTUAL music
[4:23:32] <Halospaz117> I kinda miss those quiet moments, made the music hit harder
[4:23:35] <%brachydios777> @lozscat On a game play level I disagree, but on story yeah
[4:23:37] <+That_Marcus_Dude> @mdkcde lmao games have actual music now
[4:23:39] <+CptnCampy61> I remember the promo screenshot of chief holding a sword in 2 being one of the biggest things in high school
[4:23:41] <andrei11dr> Not as much open scapes in Halo 1 huh, I guess Halo 2 was when they went hard on that
[4:23:44] <Goraka91> Oh the original xbox could do that?
[4:23:45] <+GalacticaPhanto> It's weird that I like Halo 4, not as much as the others obviously but everything except the ending was good to me
[4:23:48] <xxshadowxx416> lozscat 100 right
[4:23:48] <%jinking79> better than mk 11 background music
[4:23:52] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Halo was the first game I got the soundtrack to. Then the Vinyls once Woolie opened my eyes to how cool Vinyls are. lol
[4:23:53] <%optimasmaximas> @lozscat hell no 5 is enjoyable despite it being garbage, exiberant witness is the only shining light in it, there is no shining light in dmc2, lucia was a dim light
[4:23:53] <%subjectg> Music is supposed to be in moments that need them, silence is underrated
[4:23:55] <%RioGascar> Half life and halo let quiet in and allow you to reflect
[4:23:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> @TheOneCalledRock of course she isnt canon. or like, i think they made sure she has a unique serial number but no she isnt canon she's a guest. It was a trade, they put a Spartan in Doa And itagaki made a ninja-helmet for halo 3 MP
[4:23:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ever watch Haloid, Woolie?
[4:24:02] <slatersev> Halo 2 rocks the Guitar
[4:24:04] <@Menitta> oh man I can't imagine that
[4:24:04] <AppleBerryKitty> and I hated that!
[4:24:09] <%optimasmaximas> @jinking79 mk11 bg music is fine tho
[4:24:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus WATCH HALOID
[4:24:13] <%superc37> PLEASE WATCH HALOID
[4:24:14] <Snakes_dk> really?

[4:24:21] <%SirGO0SE> i used to play other game audio over the current audio of what i was playing
[4:24:22] <Halospaz117> I liked that the big lore was in outside material
[4:24:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> LIL V PLEASE MAKE WOOLIE WATCH HALOID

[4:24:30] <+DACH33ZMAN> JOHN = CHILD SOLDIER = RAIDEN

[4:25:34] <%a_goth_pancake> hey Woolz, go check out Breaking Quarantine. it's a comic about Johnson surviving the flood in the quarantine zone and it's gorgeous.
[4:25:37] <huskarl_zap> forerunner terminals from 3?
[4:25:41] <Halospaz117> Well not for long
[4:25:41] <marvel877> in the book yeah.
[4:25:43] <DomunDomunDomun> Keyes terminal spoils less than what V spoiled by saying Johnson comes back.
[4:25:44] <%dinnydanny777> He was still breathing when you left him
[4:25:45] <LeBlanc233> it's some real big body horror
[4:25:46] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Halo 3 terminals are safe. But recommend completing Halo 3 before watching the terminals
[4:25:48] <derap41> They Made lore from the smallest shit in HALO 1
[4:25:53] <+einherjarvalk> it's Johnson
[4:25:54] <%dinnydanny777> He was moving he wasn't dead
[4:25:54] <%a_goth_pancake> thank... you...
[4:25:54] <%alpacasintophats> Keyes
[4:25:55] <+YabbaTroll> johnson
[4:25:55] <%lotharrio> That's Johnson
[4:25:56] <%JohnAtDawn> Johnson
[4:25:57] <Halospaz117> Its Johnson
[4:25:58] <+cowardman93> Johnson
[4:25:59] <%krispen_wa> Johnson
[4:25:59] <BurdRightsActivist> Johnson wasn't juicy enough
[4:25:59] <%LozsCat> Jognson
[4:26:01] <marvel877> Johnson, and it was retconned.
[4:26:02] <Divryne> Johnson.
[4:26:02] <AppleBerryKitty> its john
[4:26:03] <%DappercatEsquire> Johnson also had all that exposure to plasma grenades
[4:26:03] <kaminaribirii> it was radiation exposure
[4:26:04] <xxshadowxx416> not heart
[4:26:05] <ThatGuyThere03> not what that is, and it's Johnson
[4:26:05] <Saffry_Ruzin> Zuka 'Zamamee and Yayap are my favorite characters in the book
[4:26:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> That's johnson and it got retconned to be he's immune because he's a Spartan 1
[4:26:06] <%krispen_wa> His Legendary johnson
[4:26:07] <Jmann9218> Its Johnson and its a brain problem
[4:26:08] <+Slimshazbot> Johnson has a wird radiation poisoning thing, but I think it was retconned
[4:26:09] <%black_pariah> his infection form messed up and he was still conscious
[4:26:10] <Ynkubus18> Johnsons just busted up enough
[4:26:10] <+YabbaTroll> Though its acutally kinda strange
[4:26:11] <UncannyMatt> World War Z logic
[4:26:12] <%alpacasintophats> Johnson has a radiative disease
[4:26:14] <%Javaa01> Yeah the Flood doesn't go for weak hosts
[4:26:14] <arbeh> The ONE marine that fought his way in the library when even chief got winded was the SHIT
[4:26:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> its not even spoilers its Book-only spoilers
[4:26:15] <@Menitta> huh
[4:26:15] <Fang_of_Yeenoghu> Good ole Spartan 1 heart issues
[4:26:16] <%brachydios777> Johnson
[4:26:16] <%SirGO0SE> its Cortana :)
[4:26:16] <+eiightbiitt> @woolieversus will you play Halo 2 next?
[4:26:17] <+TheShisno> Johnson was yucky food
[4:26:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:26:21] <+Killyko> Project Orion
[4:26:25] <%a_goth_pancake> Johnson has a neurological issue because of a plasma nade.
[4:26:25] <%black_pariah> thats from the anthologies
[4:26:26] <%alpacasintophats> it is never brought up in game ever
[4:26:27] <jorniev> LEGENDARY JOHNSON
[4:26:28] <+phatmac16> it was retconned so it's fine
[4:26:28] <+cowardman93> game good
[4:26:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Its John Haloid Kappa
[4:26:30] <%brachydios777> That isn’t really spoilers
[4:26:31] <%superc37> i thought johnson didnt get infected cuz of the radation or whatever fron being a spartan 1?
[4:26:31] <+JeluxDaCasual> @BurdRightsActivist Not Miranda, The mind
[4:26:36] <mdkcde> in two years
[4:26:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[4:26:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Johnson's nervous system was fried by some kind of radiation poisoning from using a whole crate of stolen plasma grenades.
[4:26:43] <ThaSparren> Its like half spoilers
[4:26:45] <%optimasmaximas> @superc37 he’s not a spartan
[4:26:47] <thealientrilogy> Flood, easy.
[4:26:48] <thesoldierofjoy> Johnson also has background lore never talked about in-game.
[4:26:51] <+Freeborg23> Headcrab for sure
[4:26:52] <%Chatterbox1991> headcrab
[4:26:52] <+attackofthesage> You don't know the flood fully yet
[4:26:52] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought Johnson was immune because of his sexual proclivities with the Covenant
[4:26:53] <+MeatBomb> There's a story in Halo? :P
[4:26:55] <+DACH33ZMAN> HALO 2 FLOOD SPOILERSSSS
[4:26:56] <+TheShisno> Flood has yet to be fully lore'd
[4:26:57] <cipher758> chest open
[4:26:58] <%a_goth_pancake> mmmmm... neither.
[4:26:58] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> both are pretty bad
[4:26:59] <Goraka91> Far as I can tell Flood people cease to exist after a bit
