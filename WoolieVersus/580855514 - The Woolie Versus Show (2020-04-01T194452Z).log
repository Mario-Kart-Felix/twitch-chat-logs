[0:39:41] <YakumoYomi> That dance wasn't as safe as they said it was...
[0:39:42] <jorniev> HE DID THE THING
[0:39:44] <%arkv01> the harem grows
[0:39:49] <%ironohki> On Reddit's whowouldwin board, we discussed if Jedi were generally on par with Avatar benders. Both have big power godpersons and basic low level scrubs.
[0:40:12] <Gruhunchously> It's just chemicals, man
[0:40:34] <derap41> Those were all trash mobs woolie
[0:40:44] <%lotharrio> Oh what's his Master class?
[0:40:54] <+Superspider51> Jedi Master
[0:41:00] <%lotharrio> That's the caster, right?
[0:41:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:41:10] <Gruhunchously> This guy is actually a James Bond villain
[0:41:18] <YakumoYomi> The upper limit of what benders/the Avatar could do seems to higher than what we've seen Jedi/Sith masters do.
[0:41:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> FAT PEOPLE ALWAYS LIE—Revan
[0:41:36] <+gutlesscoward> does the smell of hate come off in the shower
[0:41:39] <DSD24> The Fat Evil

[0:42:46] <NeakGX> Hanharr knows the score
[0:42:49] <Gruhunchously> Hey, there's a section coming up where Stealth would be very handy
[0:42:52] <DSD24> God Fann looks so cool here
[0:42:52] <WanderingSwordsman> like when god and satan placed a bet on Jobb
[0:42:55] <Redblood801> No map
[0:43:04] <+mankeyfigh> There's always one character that is ASSURED of victory and is SUPER WRONG

[0:51:04] <%Pillagius> Well, she can use mines
[0:51:05] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:51:08] <gunsrlove> Fuck wookies, they suck
[0:51:09] <+Superspider51> use levels to heal
[0:51:16] <+kekkerscrew> OH
[0:51:17] <Badgerconda_> Beating hanharr isn't hard... it's the part -after- that, which is hard.
[0:51:26] <dorpork> @subjectg you need hanharr to learn the true lesson of strength
[0:51:31] <%lotharrio> Why are there humans named Hugh?
[0:51:33] <supuhmagikarp> Don't be a bitch use mines to kill
[0:51:39] <DSD24> Mira is a normal name though
[0:51:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lotharrio Exactly!
[0:51:43] <indig0bird> Miralukans exist since the second Dark Forces game
[0:51:45] <atema128> I actually quite like Mira!
[0:51:45] <%ironohki> @supuhmagikarp may be on to something.
[0:51:47] <%Irridium> look the lines were recorded, there's like 5 months to launch... fuck it
[0:51:49] <indig0bird> That's like late 90s
[0:51:52] <Redblood801> OH HE COMIN'!
[0:51:57] <YakumoYomi> Oh lawd...he comin!
[0:51:58] <Zathas> oh lawd he comin
[0:51:59] <%ironohki> BATHE HIM IN MINES.
[0:52:08] <%optimasmaximas> pump in her
[0:52:11] <Badgerconda_> PUMP SOME INTO HER
[0:52:15] <Chisas_Dead_Body> OH LAWD
[0:52:18] <%Irridium> I just pumped her stealth and snuck out
[0:52:19] <YakumoYomi> Giggity
[0:52:27] <%lotharrio> Wasting points in Stealth makes sense for this.
[0:52:30] <Zathas> HEFTY chonk
[0:52:34] <subjectg> @dorpork eh, sure, but too much effort for an ls playthrough
[0:52:35] <SinnerBeta> STOP only level her if she's about to die for the free heal!
[0:52:38] <%Irridium> stealth is REAL GOOD HERE
[0:52:38] <giga_bit> KOTOR 2 companions are like 60% sentinel skill monkies
[0:52:41] <%lotharrio> For this section alone, stealth is useful.
[0:52:44] <Gruhunchously> Stealth is actually really helpful here
[0:52:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> What is hanharr's classs
[0:52:56] <Gruhunchously> He's a scout as well
[0:52:59] <supuhmagikarp> Ran a recent playthrough when woolie started. you can totaly get away with not leveling here
[0:53:04] <SinnerBeta> !STOP only level her if she's about to die for the free heal!
[0:53:07] <supuhmagikarp> just use mines
[0:53:13] <SinnerBeta> @WoolieVersus !STOP only level her if she's about to die for the free heal!
[0:53:14] <%lotharrio> Hanharr is a scout but he's got a toe in a D&D berserker.
[0:53:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's so wierd that this game is just neverwinter with star wars
[0:53:17] <subjectg> mines are always the best solution
[0:53:21] <Goodvibes99508> also.damage of mines
[0:53:25] <+kekkerscrew> Remember, Leveling heals you
[0:53:32] <ralphfromdk> WoolieVersus Like others say, save the levels for free heals
[0:53:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> @WoolieVersus Levels heal
[0:53:48] <ZeeJiggle> I think it'll be fine.
[0:53:54] <SinnerBeta> STOP only level her if she's about to die for the free heal!
[0:53:58] <%VCRUZZO> you can, and use her rockests but its a rough fight
[0:53:59] <Goodvibes99508> save levels for heal
[0:54:01] <Gruhunchously> ah
[0:54:10] <+Superspider51> that way you might not have to waste levels and can level later
[0:54:27] <+mighty_max_t> Level up to heal is also a strong tactic in Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3
[0:54:29] <+kekkerscrew> ok now he remembered we can stop.
[0:54:54] <Gruhunchously> Why is everyone so stuck up about wasting levels? We already lost most of Bao-Dur's skill points because he wouldn't level him before he changed classes.
[0:55:04] <%Irridium> kite him into the mines
[0:55:31] <%lotharrio> Take that you walking carpet!
[0:55:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:55:32] <Gruhunchously> That didn't work
[0:55:37] <TheVoltStrike> funny how the mines drop into the floor
[0:56:11] <dorpork> animation cancelling
[0:56:14] <dorpork> lol
[0:56:15] <NeakGX> oh boy canceling tech
[0:56:30] <derap41> Wooh boy she running
[0:56:34] <+wunp_fxs> welcome to old school game logic
[0:56:37] <%lotharrio> Proper ranged tactics.
[0:56:38] <%optimasmaximas> lame it out LUL
[0:56:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE CANCELS
[0:56:45] <Redblood801> This is just like my fighting games
[0:56:46] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:56:46] <Gruhunchously> D&D logic
[0:56:48] <AllTheZibas> ZONER PogChamp
[0:56:49] <%TheOneCalledRock> LAME IT OUT
[0:56:51] <ZeeJiggle> Ye the adrenal is making it so he cant catch up too
[0:56:52] <Explodincatz> kite for ev er
[0:56:53] <LeeOhX> Big hero moves
[0:56:53] <+kekkerscrew> Use terms woolie can unders tand
[0:56:53] <MayorRev> pew pew
[0:56:56] <Graxe_> Can't get hit if they never get in range
[0:56:57] <R0dn3y> also known as "kiting"
[0:56:57] <Space_Pagan> pew pew pew
[0:57:00] <ralphfromdk> I mean... it makes sense in real life too. Don't bring a knife to a gunfight
[0:57:01] <WanderingSwordsman> Lame it out like X Tekken
[0:57:03] <derap41> Kite like a pro
[0:57:05] <MayorRev> SCHUT
[0:57:07] <%siamzero94> ARE YOU ENTERTAINED VISQUIS?
[0:57:09] <+theKingRamses> run and gun
[0:57:13] <grandark_z317> @Gruhunchously dnd logic would have the ranged character close the distance very quickly.
[0:57:24] <grandark_z317> or just use a ranged weapon themself.
[0:57:28] <+Superspider51> after this would be a great use of grenades
[0:57:29] <%rubbishbinge> yeah that makes sense
[0:57:29] <+kekkerscrew> I have a gun. So I Run
[0:57:31] <SinnerBeta> just stealth with her for the rest of the location
[0:57:39] <DSD24> Look at him limping
[0:57:41] <grandark_z317> close-ranged character*
[0:57:43] <Gruhunchously> @grandark_z317 What if they don't have a ranged weapon
[0:57:47] <supuhmagikarp> Yay!
[0:57:49] <+wunp_fxs> bye bye boring chracter
[0:57:49] <derap41> And she even has the worst mask
[0:57:51] <LeeOhX> "STOP RUNNING" - Hanharr
[0:57:53] <%Irridium> you got a stealth field and an enhancer. Should be more than enough to sneak through the whole thing
[0:57:56] <%Pillagius> I'm pretty sure you can find the console you need really fast, so you don't suffer long
[0:57:57] <grandark_z317> @Gruhunchously close the distance.
[0:57:58] <+jiggy_snipe> my use of GUN
[0:57:59] <%mitchteck> Just run to the door
[0:58:01] <royb2> !uptime
[0:58:02] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 40 minutes
[0:58:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This guy isn't that smart.
[0:58:03] <giga_bit> Hanharr is your sibling who doesn't think to climb over the couch when you're playing tag in the house
[0:58:07] <DSD24> The dogs
[0:58:08] <derap41> Didn't expect you to be such a bitch
[0:58:14] <%lotharrio> Squidface, "Why didn't she just hold still and enter melee with the Wookie?"
[0:58:16] <%siamzero94> whatever he's a bitch
[0:58:17] <+mankeyfigh> THIS IDIOT
[0:58:18] <%arkv01> these doggos are cuuuute
[0:58:20] <akman14> Aw lord it's comming!
[0:58:25] <+kekkerscrew> This is legitimate You've got a gun
[0:58:28] <ralphfromdk> Release the hounds
[0:58:34] <%arkv01> D:
[0:58:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> one inept guard
[0:58:49] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Hanharr is so much better than her it’s not even funny
[0:58:50] <dorpork> her jacket negates damage IIRC
[0:58:51] <derap41> Welp messed that up
[0:58:51] <+wunp_fxs> wait
[0:58:56] <dorpork> use her rocket launcher
[0:58:57] <+wunp_fxs> your not taking damage
[0:59:07] <DSD24> Those dodges
[0:59:07] <%Eaglestrike117> does uhh
[0:59:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> is her throwing grenades with her rocket is it somehow bette than normal grenade tossing
[0:59:11] <dereks0n> Hanharr could kill Vader 1v1 and I stand by that
[0:59:15] <%Eaglestrike117> does he accidentaly have god mod on
[0:59:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> her wrist launcher*
[0:59:22] <%lotharrio> Adhesive grenades are great.
[0:59:22] <+Superspider51> plasma is the nuke
[0:59:23] <dorpork> her jacket has damage resistance
[0:59:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> she....cant die
[0:59:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> SHE'S FUCKING INVINCIBLE
[0:59:35] <%VCRUZZO> adhesive works great
[0:59:40] <%Irridium> snuff those puppers
[0:59:40] <LeeOhX> shes not even taking damage
[0:59:45] <DSD24> Dog noises
[0:59:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> PUPPER SNUFFER
[0:59:56] <therakishsage> You should have a look at her jacket.
[1:00:01] <+conradical> how no dmg
[1:00:06] <giga_bit> pit nothing
[1:00:10] <Gruhunchously> You're not going to get through the next section without leveling.
[1:00:14] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Well she did say shes the best
[1:00:16] <ZeeJiggle> Han Car
[1:00:16] <+mankeyfigh> DAMN SHE STRUNG
[1:00:25] <DSD24> I like Mira more
[1:00:33] <%ironohki> Stonk
[1:00:36] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I like Mira's rocket launcher more tho
[1:00:37] <DatAsuna> I wouldn't call him deep
[1:00:37] <+Fortunato5678> He's pretty boring when you get him
[1:00:39] <DatAsuna> he is cool
[1:00:39] <%Eaglestrike117> So. you said this was a hard fight, but you havent taken a single point of damage, did you accidentally turn god mod on?
[1:00:41] <WanderingSwordsman> But that ass though
[1:00:42] <+Superspider51> Mira has some interesting things going on, like a wrist rocket
[1:00:42] <+jiggy_snipe> he's a psycho Wookie
[1:00:44] <brondeef> Wookie Malcolm X
[1:00:45] <DatAsuna> but he's a walking plot device
[1:00:52] <+jiggy_snipe> you have HK for the psycho lulz
[1:00:55] <@Commando_Joe> You...met evil wookies in the first game
[1:01:00] <%lotharrio> You saw one in the previous game. Big Z's brother was a lying slaver.
[1:01:01] <DSD24> Wait you saw that shitty Woolie in KOTOR1
[1:01:01] <therakishsage> Basically her jacket is lined with some kind of space-age armor weave that makes her ignore physical attacks.
[1:01:02] <%Prevot> wookies are just wookies, boring
[1:01:14] <Safarihat> eagle his defense with the stim on nullified the damage
[1:01:16] <Gruhunchously> The Ewoks were about to f*ckin eat the heroes.
[1:01:17] <@Commando_Joe> Zalbaar's brother was evil as fuck
[1:01:18] <BallerSwagBro9k> Nah man Ewoks eat people
[1:01:19] <+theKingRamses> wookies are stereotyped into angry arm rippers, how is that light side
[1:01:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @therakishsage im sure that would be awesome if she ZIPPED IT UP
[1:01:23] <DSD24> Remember that Shitty Wookie that was selling his own people into slavery in Kashyyk
[1:01:23] <carlosmiyamoto> Quick on the dismissal button ):
[1:01:31] <time_axis> Hanharr is pretty hardcore
[1:01:34] <%siamzero94> @DSD24 I know typo and all, but "OOF"
[1:01:37] <dereks0n> I feel like Mira's first impression ruins her in the long run
[1:01:43] <DSD24> @siamzero94 Oh man I am so sorry
[1:01:45] <Gruhunchously> Hanharr is a dark DARK character
[1:01:46] <therakishsage> Hey, she knows to pivot so the blows hit the jacket! @LiquidDinosaur
[1:01:54] <DSD24> That wasn't my intention @siamzero94
[1:01:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> also it doesnt even cover her stomach
[1:02:10] <derap41> XP is from the same pool
[1:02:19] <therakishsage> She PIVOTS, believe me.
[1:02:46] <%siamzero94> @DSD24 Ey, still better than "Jewie"
[1:02:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:02:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> 1000+2000+3000+etc
[1:02:48] <Badgerconda_> mmm. beast tenders. delicious.
[1:03:07] <SinnerBeta> STEALTH
[1:03:16] <Redblood801> Oh now she takes damage
[1:03:16] <giga_bit> he took damage PogChamp
[1:03:21] <Zathas> Finally.
[1:03:25] <LeeOhX> So what the heck was that before
[1:03:29] <Safarihat> the stim
[1:03:31] <%siamzero94> FAT GUYS HIT HARD
[1:03:33] <giga_bit> extreme luck?
[1:03:35] <Gruhunchously> Their damage was too low
[1:03:37] <dorpork> her jacket negates a small amount of damage
[1:03:43] <Zathas> Those dogs did not spec into finesse.
[1:03:49] <therakishsage> Not luck, it's just that her jacket negates damage, and the dogs are kind of weeny.
[1:03:53] <%Irridium> you could just stealth the whole thing
[1:03:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> REDHEAD POUNDED WITH LONG SHAFTS BY OBESE MEN IN GIMP SUITS
[1:04:00] <therakishsage> These guys are just really good at cutting things.
[1:04:04] <%lotharrio> Do drugs and shoot dudes!
[1:04:04] <ZeeJiggle> Lame it out like it's Cross Tekken
[1:04:11] <+Superspider51> turn on the melee shield
[1:04:14] <megamirk> this section gave me PTSD
[1:04:19] <megamirk> when I first played it
[1:04:20] <giga_bit> 3rd edition has never looked better
[1:04:32] <%siamzero94> confirmed hanharr was a bitch. the ubese are for real
[1:04:32] <DSD24> She is still cool Woolie
[1:04:41] <LeeOhX> Not to Woolie shes not
[1:04:47] <+mankeyfigh> I mean give her a chance
[1:04:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> Do you think woolie will be more interested in her when she reveals she's a Foundling?
[1:04:52] <therakishsage> Honestly, Woolie is building up Hanharr way more in his own head than the actual thing.
[1:04:53] <+SilverDevilfish> stahp
[1:04:57] <+kekkerscrew> You're not wrong V
[1:04:58] <dereks0n> I don't think Woolie's gonna ever give her a chance from this moment on lmao
[1:05:02] <+Superspider51> don't max her out
[1:05:06] <%Pillagius> Maybe use levelups to heal?
[1:05:16] <+Suplexsenpai> She’s really not that bad
[1:05:20] <Goodvibes99508> Coward
[1:05:21] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> This section is so easy as Hanharr. Just rip and tear through everyone
[1:05:31] <privatesargent> i mean, Hanharr is not that interesting, its just a wookie that absolutely hates being in debt to anybody and is murder happy
[1:05:37] <privatesargent> he is just a predator
[1:05:39] <LeeOhX> Shes as boring as Atton....was Kappa
[1:05:45] <+Llewelln> Stormtrooper aim
[1:05:48] <dereks0n> Style over substances
[1:05:56] <+klholland92> Think about what this looks like: you shoot her and she’s like IM EVEN MORE POWERFUL NOW
[1:06:01] <%lotharrio> Could activate her shield, do some stims, throw down adhesives... you got options here.
[1:06:05] <privatesargent> i didn't realize till now, Hanharr is just a goddamn predator
[1:06:11] <Gruhunchously> THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM
[1:06:34] <+klholland92> IM BETTER WITH DEMOLITIONS NOW
[1:06:42] <ZeeJiggle> Wow, suddenly this gun is shooting harder
[1:06:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> "shooting these gimps is making me better at arming bombs"
[1:06:54] <giga_bit> mira is just popping a kaioken
[1:07:02] <Gruhunchously> just use a stealth generator guys
[1:07:03] <ralphfromdk> senzu bean!!!
[1:07:03] <Starkiller_1999_> I usually make use of mines in this section with mira, she just struggles here
[1:07:11] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I eventually just start loading my grenades in the wrist launcher and kill everything
[1:07:16] <%lotharrio> Yeah, I went stealth and dropped a lot of mines.
[1:07:18] <+Suplexsenpai> “Let’s see what you got” LUL
[1:07:21] <+mankeyfigh> I mean this is obviously harder if you don't pop ALL the levels
[1:07:22] <closetgremlin12> so what happens if you play hanhar?
[1:07:22] <Redblood801> Why are these blaster bolts hotter?
[1:07:34] <Starkiller_1999_> its actually the only time demolitions came into real use LUL
[1:07:35] <FlashFrame> I usually catch the vod's on youtube, but hey... good to finally catch a live stream.
[1:07:38] <%lotharrio> Is there better armor for her?
[1:07:40] <+Gabryguedes> Gabryguedes subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:07:45] <Gruhunchously> Not the side doors
[1:07:47] <%siamzero94> @closetgremlin12 hanharr can't prestige so just level him up all the way
[1:07:52] <%VCRUZZO> yes
[1:07:59] <closetgremlin12> I meant for the duel
[1:08:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @closetgremlin12 i believe the mindflayer just betrays hanharr and you do this same section as him after killing mira
[1:08:17] <Gruhunchously> Just go left
[1:08:21] <derap41> You know that Girl With Red Dreads in Jak 3? They share the same ass
[1:08:36] <Sarevic> @closetgremlin12 You kill Mira and do what they're now doing
[1:08:43] <LeeOhX> This isworking Woolis this is jus the first 2 guys
[1:08:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> Does any actual action you perform as an evil guy make it so hanharr is your partyy mmber or is it just "your evil so the game gives you control of him and not mira"
[1:09:01] <ZeeJiggle> It's just "You evil"
[1:09:04] <%optimasmaximas> alright guys, im braving the corona world for p5r, and im takin you with me to keep you updated BlessRNG
[1:09:06] <giga_bit> just "you evil"
[1:09:09] <DSD24> Dark Side or Light Side
[1:09:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> that's dumb. It shoudl be "you're evil therefore X happened therefore Hanharr"
[1:09:38] <DSD24> Oh you mean a Reason why you would play as Hanharr
[1:09:39] <Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur You know when Mira meets you before you go into the bar? IF you're dark side it's Hannharr who meets you instead because 'You seem really evil, we could get along.'
[1:09:50] <ZeeJiggle> There might be a little more subtext but ultimately it is just a check if you're evil or not
[1:09:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[1:10:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously okay, that's reasonable. He'd be able to smell a fellow tortured soul.
[1:10:17] <LeeOhX> this part kinda sucks holy
[1:10:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> or like, tortured soul who decides to be a dick. this whole game is about broken people.
[1:10:29] <Gruhunchously> Yeah it's not great
[1:10:40] <%lotharrio> Adhesive grenades are really strong against melee characters.
[1:10:41] <ZeeJiggle> Quick make a crawler to rebuild
[1:10:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> No im okay with Hanharr approaching you if you're a dick just like Mira approaches you if you're not a dick
[1:10:52] <LeeOhX> but hey 14 months or w.e so i cant complain
[1:10:55] <%Irridium> I never fought through this part always stealthed
[1:11:01] <+Superspider51> these levels hurt my soul
[1:11:03] <Gruhunchously> The easiest thing to do is to just stealth out, honestly.
[1:11:04] <%Irridium> just hug the walls and you good
[1:11:04] <SinnerBeta> @WoolieVersus you could always just stealth her through this location
[1:11:10] <giga_bit> "guys revive me i've got ray gun"
[1:11:11] <Starkiller_1999_> its much easier if you make use of mines you have saved up
[1:11:15] <privatesargent> truthfully, BOTH Hanharr and Mira are weaker characters then the rest of the cast
[1:11:20] <%lotharrio> @Superspider51 For Mira, these levels are probably ideal, regardless.
[1:11:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> there's like a cheat thing in this area. if you clip through one wall there's an ubese who can let you do console commands? its on the xbox version
[1:11:26] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I mean if you could make a better kotor game in 14 months be my guest lol
[1:11:27] <%Djinnazz> @SinnerBeta XP tho
[1:11:28] <+Suplexsenpai> NO HE MUST BIG FIGHT
[1:11:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[1:11:28] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 53 minutes
[1:11:35] <+Superspider51> depends on how you want to spec her @lotharrio
[1:11:37] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The best thing about Hanharr is all the Kriea dialouge for me, which you miss if you're light side
[1:11:42] <Lancaster_H> @privatesargent Disciple kinda sucks too
[1:11:47] <+Superspider51> now she's kinda locked into blaster
[1:11:50] <Gruhunchously> I could absolutley not make a better KOTOR game in 14 months
[1:11:54] <+mankeyfigh> STEALTH?
[1:12:00] <derap41> You get good and Parry
[1:12:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> souls aint turn based
[1:12:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Damashi_The_Kaotic why woudnt light side hanhar mod have those dialogues
[1:12:49] <kulmoth> i mean neither hanhar or mira are that interesting so it doesn't really matter
[1:12:50] <abelincoln_catpuncher> you did it!
[1:12:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[1:12:51] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I said that statement under the assumption you aren't using the choose btween Hamharr and Mira mod
[1:12:54] <DSD24> The problems
[1:13:06] <+cinder_chan> man the ubese suits are so cool
[1:13:09] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Hamharr*
[1:13:16] <+mankeyfigh> problem?
[1:13:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> best option would be to get them both in your party and have Kreia torture Hanharr into not killing Mira
[1:13:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> miiiyyyrrah
[1:13:34] <Lancaster_H> @LiquidDinosaur keep watching.
[1:13:36] <Gruhunchously> He's literally a Bond villain
[1:13:37] <%lotharrio> Almost like he should have had all his Ubese in that one room that could ruin his plans.
[1:13:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> anything involving Kreia fucking with peeps has my vote
[1:13:41] <%rubbishbinge> BAKANA
[1:13:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Lancaster_H o no i remember. She wants him to kill mira right?
[1:14:01] <GarbageNirvana> There's no problem I will not save wave after wave of men into
[1:14:11] <+jiggy_snipe> Fann "The Boy" Y'Pak
[1:14:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> OHHHH you mean, if you get hanharr in your party you never get Kreia breaks Hanharr
[1:14:19] <jnaynnay> kzxSON woolieVS wooliePOYO fight
[1:14:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> >miss
[1:14:25] <Redblood801> How tragic
[1:14:29] <%ironohki> I imagine people in universe shouting "EE-POK!"
[1:14:32] <Gruhunchously> Kreia breaks Hanharr regardless
[1:14:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> General Y'Pakk
[1:14:38] <ZeeJiggle> Like you just hear a door open behind you, and suddenly you cannot move.
[1:14:42] <+kekkerscrew> Fann YY's Back Alright!
[1:14:47] <Gruhunchously> Just, if you're dark side, she breaks him into following you.
[1:14:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> you werea general and a war hero your face is on some kids educational holovids
[1:14:50] <+mankeyfigh> Their saving throws ARE SHIT
[1:14:50] <%ironohki> "Fawn Ee-pok"
[1:14:52] <DSD24> Man these guys are dying hard
[1:15:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> you're the guy who authorized the Manhattan project
[1:15:29] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kriea has a lesson for you to learn, but you only get that quest line if you have him as a party member instead of Mira. "The TRUE lesson of strength"
[1:15:34] <Redblood801> POWER!
[1:15:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> I like how the aliens talk jibberish but they specifically pronounce jedi wrong in subtitles
[1:15:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> U N L I M I T E D
[1:16:03] <Space_Pagan> Big Light Side later lightning
[1:16:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Damashi_The_Kaotic is that where you make Hanharr's Str go up 2 and his Int go down 2, and if you do it 5 times he has 256 intelligence because the bit overflows
[1:16:18] <%lotharrio> Only Hanharr pronounces it wrong, and only because he doesn't really know what he's talking about.
[1:16:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> and the squid
[1:16:25] <+kekkerscrew> Powers are just powers, not good, not evil.
[1:16:26] <+mankeyfigh> You know... Fallen Order was a pretty good game

[1:22:48] <WanderingSwordsman> This is just the DS lp all over again
[1:22:50] <%lotharrio> I guess that Ubese killed Exar-kun
[1:22:53] <%jinking79> that is some Dark Souls RNG luck
[1:22:55] <subjectg> it’s not too rare, but who am i to spoil the fun?
[1:22:55] <NeakGX> Thanks Ted
[1:22:56] <indig0bird> It restricts force powers
[1:22:57] <SinnerBeta> found like 4 malak armors in my last playthrough, all of them in those plastic barrels lol
[1:23:02] <BearSawed> hey thats a baller swag sword right there
[1:23:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> "YOU FOUND TOJO'S GLASSES"

[1:23:17] <derap41> Look at it its sexy
[1:23:18] <indig0bird> BAO FUCKING DUR
[1:23:21] <Gruhunchously> Exar Chan
[1:23:22] <DatAsuna> sadly it's just a generic look
[1:23:29] <privatesargent> why would Exar Kun's armor not allow force powers, he is a Jedi turned Sith?
[1:23:32] <derap41> Shut up Woolie
[1:23:34] <+MidnightBurst12> don't worry about it
[1:23:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> Exar Kun i so kawaii
[1:23:35] <LeeOhX> SAVE
[1:23:38] <SinnerBeta> why the fuck exar chan armor doesn't have the ability to use armor
[1:23:39] <%JohnAtDawn> !uptime
[1:23:40] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 6 minutes
[1:23:41] <SinnerBeta> use force*
[1:23:46] <%VCRUZZO> yes
[1:23:51] <DatAsuna> that lore video told you so :P
[1:23:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> Nya Exar Kun sama
[1:23:54] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:23:55] <%yendoria> Thats not very long ago a all
[1:23:56] <Space_Pagan> Save the game!
[1:23:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he could ave himself with force powers because he was wearing it LUL
[1:24:00] <%lotharrio> I think the Sith armor is the best one for people who don't wear robes?
[1:24:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> you're proably like, mid 40s?
[1:24:04] <%siamzero94> wow so hard confirm they don't read chat
[1:24:04] <DatAsuna> Jolee was AROUND during that
[1:24:08] <%caffienatedjedi> !uptime
[1:24:09] <@Commando_Joe> @jorniev simmer the fuck down
[1:24:11] <DatAsuna> He tells you
[1:24:11] <+MidnightBurst12> jolee talked about it like he was there
[1:24:17] <+SolidusRex> The "force limitations based on armor" thing is just hold-over DnD mechanics about spellcasting
[1:24:20] <Halospaz117> I think the exile is supposed to be like early to mid thirties
[1:24:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> you're a very healthy and youthful 35-40
[1:24:32] <grandark_z317> what a fucking idiot.
[1:24:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> OLD MAN BOOMER
[1:24:41] <%jepupu> Exar-senpai
[1:24:44] <%lotharrio> Exar-kun is a boomer.
[1:24:51] <%RioGascar> space boomer
[1:24:53] <DSD24> I hope it looks cool
[1:24:59] <DatAsuna> Exar kun also just didn't wear that
[1:24:59] <%VCRUZZO> Mando war happens after the Sith War when Exar loses
[1:25:03] <DatAsuna> and did have multiple looks
[1:25:04] <%siamzero94> maybe, the mando wars were 10 years ago
[1:25:08] <+DesertPenguin> Fuck V is only 28
[1:25:10] <subjectg> think about it, you have, in the span of 40 years, 3 very devastating wars, rather bleak
[1:25:14] <DatAsuna> It's just a fun description on a generic set
[1:25:26] <%RioGascar> 3 galactic scale wars
[1:25:28] <%arkv01> exar-chan wasn't a fashionista
[1:25:30] <derap41> Not that fancy for legendary armor
[1:25:32] <DatAsuna> comics have more freedom than games yeah
[1:25:34] <LeeOhX> Aw it looks lame af
[1:25:35] <giga_bit> why must 90% of armor in this game come with a pair of sweatpants
[1:25:38] <%VCRUZZO> Exar really loved his black robe outfit
[1:25:43] <%RioGascar> so people gotta be FUCKING tired of wars by now
[1:25:44] <%lotharrio> They comfy
[1:25:46] <subjectg> It’s no wonder the republic is on the verge of collapse
[1:25:47] <yeildingthought> Jolee had loose knowledge of exar
[1:25:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @giga_bit if you're going to fight might as wel be comfortable
[1:25:55] <%VCRUZZO> yeah it sucks
[1:25:58] <time_axis> Darth Malak's spare armor that he never wore maybe
[1:26:00] <DatAsuna> asset reuse
[1:26:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> :_:
[1:26:02] <akman14> Darth Malaks
[1:26:02] <%caffienatedjedi> Its his evening wear
[1:26:02] <%arkv01> that is ABSOLUTELY yurusenai
[1:26:06] <DatAsuna> that's not just an old game thing
[1:26:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh god remember that SITH CEREMONIAL ARMOR and its like a fucking beige vest with pockets?
[1:26:10] <DatAsuna> new games do that shit too
[1:26:14] <grandark_z317> 14 months
[1:26:16] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> time probably
[1:26:19] <+Superspider51> there is a mod for this game that gives all the unique armor unique models
[1:26:21] <akman14> More like Darth Malakas
[1:26:25] <DSD24> Man these Obese guy's aren't doing much
[1:26:31] <%VCRUZZO> @LiquidDinosaur YEAH, that was shit
[1:26:33] <%lotharrio> Just give it a cape!
[1:26:42] <+ShadowArcangel> Exar Kun being only 40 years ago give a lot of context to the mental state of the council and older people of the order, the KOTOR comics touch on it
[1:26:49] <+MrMoonGoose> There's gotta be an armor mod
[1:26:57] <%RioGascar> Its already have an existing model too
[1:26:57] <%lotharrio> It also explains why everyone is so done with the Jedi.
[1:26:58] <R0dn3y> That dancer's outfit was more important to add
[1:27:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> @VCRUZZO like pick one of the fancier generic armors. not the the like, something i could pick up at Cabellas
[1:27:08] <+ShadowArcangel> exactly
[1:27:11] <%RioGascar> just take maleks armor model and modify it
[1:27:14] <Gruhunchously> Sleeping on the job
[1:27:17] <giga_bit> they're just having a little water cooler chat
[1:27:18] <%RioGascar> its not like the model DOESNT exist
[1:27:22] <%lotharrio> It's been like 100 years of on again, off again wars between Jedi and other space cultures.
[1:27:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> what "class" would malak have been. Marauder/
[1:27:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> ?
[1:27:35] <%arkv01> yeah this part of the plot kinda poops itself
[1:27:41] <subjectg> He’s a Guardian in kotor 1
[1:27:44] <BisoromiBear> "What are you gonna do, stab me?"
[1:27:44] <BlueMoonBlues> "This is fine"
[1:27:47] <%RioGascar> This is fine
[1:27:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he just wanted to be a rowdy boi
[1:28:01] <+ShadowArcangel> "Can we go like 50 years without these assclowns bringing the about the end of all things?"
[1:28:08] <indig0bird> Oh, that one is the ridiculously hard one
[1:28:09] <Redblood801> Booo, no lightsaber
[1:28:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> you know what my favorite plan is in this game? Lets do an evil ritual on this ancient sith temple.....In order to control a giant lizard that is bashing down a door on the neighboring planet"
[1:28:22] <NeakGX> "Did the gas get em yet?"
[1:28:26] <indig0bird> I remember there's like 2 in that base that just have ridiculous Security checks
[1:28:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> ....why does the sith even care about general valku?
[1:28:42] <subjectg> proxy ruler is gud
[1:28:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> i thought Nihilus just wants to om nom everyone
[1:28:54] <DSD24> This is silly
[1:29:03] <Starkiller_1999_> I think those lockers are actually bugged, I remember having a high security and still being locked out of them.
[1:29:10] <subjectg> but i suppose nihilus wanted slave first
[1:29:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[1:29:24] <Redblood801> Oh god the horror
[1:29:26] <Graxe_> But they're powered by hate
[1:29:32] <Graxe_> Surely, that's enough to stop you
[1:29:33] <%lotharrio> It's like Jedi do wars in this galaxy like it's the Olympics. "Hm? Four years already? Time to tear the galaxy apart with some dark side shenanigans."
[1:29:35] <DSD24> For as cool as these guys look they are jobbing so hard right now
[1:29:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> they're just ODSTs
[1:29:52] <Starkiller_1999_> just bash those lockers you can't security through, bashing doesn't actually break the items in those specific lockers @WoolieVersus
[1:29:55] <Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur I guess they wanted Master Kavar so that Nihilus could om nom him.
[1:30:01] <tolloponik> ah-HA, ...hey.
[1:30:08] <NeakGX> Iron MAn
[1:30:15] <Redblood801> Looks like Carth's
[1:30:20] <subjectg> too bad they didn’t go doublebladed master flurry, the animation is cool
[1:30:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously Vaklu's plan was "feed the mindless gaping void monster to appease him so he'll leave us alone" right?
[1:30:20] <Klefth> That looks super dumb
[1:30:23] <%arkv01> the absolute POMP
[1:30:24] <DSD24> You can't escape!
[1:30:25] <%lotharrio> Don't mock the Shocker.

[1:31:46] <Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur I don't think Vaklu knew what Nihilus even was. In the dark side playthrough, you find out that he planned to betray the Sith right back once he didn't need them anymore.
[1:31:46] <subjectg> remember that there is a dialog window for checking all these dnd mechanics going on behind the scenes, something sorely missing from dragon age
[1:31:46] <LeeOhX> its his cousin
[1:31:55] <%lotharrio> ...Disappointed!
[1:32:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @giga_bit G0t0 is my favorite companion i never ever use. Except in that one part in Dantooine that's like "ok we saved your life. that'll be 500 credits, because acording to an obscure subclause of the Dantooine planetary charter, if you save someone from giant spiders you can legally enslave them. And you're worth 500 credits, so pay up or its off to the Nar Shadaa auction block"

[1:35:47] <indig0bird> Trygiving him passives
[1:35:48] <+Superspider51> gotta give him a lightsaber for that
[1:35:57] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Force choke and Kill are useful even if saved

[1:39:38] <Augus7717> dex so good he can juggle double bladed lightsabers
[1:39:43] <+SolidusRex> Armor doesn't effect attack rolls with DEX weapons
[1:39:48] <%siamzero94> give him a sword and lightsaber and put him on ranged
[1:39:56] <+SolidusRex> Only effects DEX mod for AC
[1:40:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> @supuhmagikarp why would he LOSE a feat? in DnD you can take new class levels but you still have the old ones
[1:40:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> flippy bois
[1:40:09] <DSD24> Damn Atton is kicking ass
[1:40:11] <giga_bit> Atton putting in the work

[1:40:50] <Redblood801> Best Bounty Hunters on Nar SHadaa!
[1:40:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, Max Dex Bonus is a cap on how dodgy you can be
[1:40:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> legendary bounty hunters beaten to death by a tomboy and 2 war criminals
[1:41:10] <DSD24> Yellow lightsaber fits Atton pretty well
[1:41:22] <308caliber> damn you made Atton a beast
[1:41:29] <flagi64> did we make him gun jedi?
[1:41:30] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur it’s just a weird system thing, since unarmed specialist is based on level, and since you start at lvl 1 on a prestige class...
[1:41:38] <DSD24> She looks better with the hood
[1:41:40] <giga_bit> wow yeah, she's making it work
[1:41:44] <supuhmagikarp> @LiquidDinosaur so you get an unarmed feat upgrade every four levels. Lest say he was at unarmed 2 when they got the prestige class. so for some reason when you get the
[1:41:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> Also why is she wearing a robe? does the game automatically put her in the robes so she isnt nude in cutscenes?
[1:41:50] <%lotharrio> Since she's a Soldier, she can rock heavy armor.
[1:41:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @subjectg Sounds like something a fan patch would fix
[1:42:00] <%siamzero94> oh it pronounces her ass nicely
[1:42:19] <DatAsuna> you don't know the half of it
[1:42:19] <supuhmagikarp> @LiquidDinosaur prestige class it takes back to unarmed one and starts from there
[1:42:21] <DSD24> @siamzero94 A lot of armors do that
[1:42:25] <+Superspider51> if you had HK47 here it'd help with the sidequest
[1:42:25] <Scrub_Seeker> throw lightsaber on punch bao should give him a rocket punch
[1:42:25] <%NWannabe> atton bein best boi
[1:42:25] <%alpacasintophats> right I'm coming in late
[1:42:28] <%alpacasintophats> what'd I miss
[1:42:29] <giga_bit> What happens if 47 is here?
[1:42:43] <subjectg> @generalscpatton maybe, but i played console
[1:42:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @supuhmagikarp well of all the things to skip testing in 14 months, i can understand niche meme builds like punching
[1:42:53] <%lotharrio> I think you need to trigger them talking about killing you, to continue HK's quest.
[1:43:08] <%lotharrio> Someone has Heal, right?
[1:43:11] <supuhmagikarp> @LiquidDinosaur your still have unarmed 2 but you won't be getting upgrade until 12 levels later
[1:43:13] <NeakGX> didn't restored content increase the HK encounters anyway?
[1:43:13] <%jinking79> be better than him just being a head
[1:43:18] <308caliber> @giga_bit HK47 can't fight other HK units, he'd be temporarily removed from the party
[1:43:23] <subjectg> On the bright side, blaster jedi still got lots of love in 2, so it balances out

[1:54:12] <tolloponik> plot sword the one think that can take out plot armor
[1:54:18] <DSD24> That's how player characters work
[1:54:25] <grandark_z317> because you are an amateur, Mira. fuck off.
[1:54:37] <+RJay80> you have omikron into atton
[1:54:43] <+RJay80> now he is silent
[1:54:45] <cowcow6> is that atton gaining the points?
[1:54:50] <%VCRUZZO> lol
[1:54:50] <DSD24> Why?
[1:54:52] <megamirk> welcome in Omikron (in Atton)
[1:54:53] <+wunp_fxs> you dont know her tho....
[1:54:53] <+prime_name> Juhani 2.0
[1:54:55] <+Fortunato5678> What is there to not like yet?
[1:54:57] <astrofalcon1> uh oh
[1:54:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> shes pretty meh
[1:54:59] <@Commando_Joe> He's barely had any interactions with her and is already locked in chat, don't fight it
[1:55:01] <%Irridium> She's fine
[1:55:02] <+jiggy_snipe> i think Fann got points for letting murder happening
[1:55:08] <%Prevot> woolie the racist
[1:55:09] <DatAsuna> I like her jacket
[1:55:09] <+ShadowArcangel> You had like one interaction with her? Sounds pretty harsh
[1:55:10] <HeroSolaire> I barely remember her in the game
[1:55:12] <+jiggy_snipe> happen*
[1:55:14] <@Commando_Joe> She's not even a romance option, she's not part of the harem @WoolieVersus
[1:55:16] <Badgerconda_> I liked Mira a lot more when I played this game for the first time 16 years ago.
[1:55:18] <grandark_z317> We have let it set it.
[1:55:18] <StarlitStunner> She is only like sixteen or seventeen right?
[1:55:20] <ZeeJiggle> First impressions not high
[1:55:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> TUMMY
[1:55:23] <grandark_z317> Set in*
[1:55:23] <carlosmiyamoto> Too soon...
[1:55:24] <privatesargent> Hanharr isn
[1:55:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> you literally cant fuck her. you try and shes like "nah you're too old bro"
[1:55:25] <%BubbaRands> If she were a punch girl tho?
[1:55:30] <privatesargent> Hanharr isn't much better
[1:55:33] <alrobot2014> she's not disciple
[1:55:35] <%lotharrio> In that you don't get the female only character, yes.
[1:55:36] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> y'know what, she woulda been awesome in KotoR 1
[1:55:37] <wahilliham> mira is the kotor 2 juhani
[1:55:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> THAT IS A SICK BURN LIL V
[1:55:41] <StarlitStunner> Disciple is worse
[1:55:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> THAT IS TOO FAR
[1:55:48] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> but in KotoR 2 she is just kinda, normal
[1:55:48] <GarbageNirvana> She's got whiffs of a Mary Sue
[1:55:48] <Badgerconda_> There's like an atton-lite.
[1:55:49] <carlosmiyamoto> You don’t know her
[1:55:49] <%siamzero94> so you get bored with hanharr
[1:55:52] <supuhmagikarp> They aren't using gun Jedi Atton, it's so good
[1:55:55] <astrofalcon1> LUL
[1:55:56] <Zathas> She isn't close to an Atton.
[1:55:57] <+MidnightBurst12> nah, disciple is juhani for this game
[1:55:58] <%mitchteck> No that’s deciphering
[1:56:03] <+ktothec99> Mira and Hanharr are both forgettable but they are fine
[1:56:04] <%VCRUZZO> she doesn't really have much going for her in this, and at least Hanharr has a bit going
[1:56:05] <time_axis> I think Hanharr's backstory is interesting
[1:56:06] <DSD24> Eh
[1:56:06] <dorpork> her backstory is pretty cool
[1:56:09] <%mitchteck> No that’s deciple
[1:56:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> and Carth is the Juhani of Kotor 1
[1:56:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Kreia dialogue about Hanharr is great
[1:56:16] <+wunp_fxs> disciple is the most boring in this game.....mira is ok
[1:56:18] <%bread_assassin> Hanharr isn't deep, but he's much more interesting than Mira on the surface level.
[1:56:21] <indig0bird> Mira literally says no
[1:56:23] <%BubbaRands> Penis: Disinterested
[1:56:24] <@Commando_Joe> Mira says your dick is too old if you try to bang her and shoots you down.
[1:56:27] <grandark_z317> fly back to Atris' dry cooter
[1:56:29] <+jiggy_snipe> aren't Wookies stereotyped as violent anyway?
[1:56:29] <Space_Pagan> DO NOT charge up her loading ramp!
[1:56:29] <DatAsuna> Atris has a better aesthetic
[1:56:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton well e're getting it
[1:56:36] <%siamzero94> well she doesn't want your dirty dick to begin with
[1:56:36] <%Madbearv> wait so woolie is not into handmaiden
[1:56:36] <wowowinsane> disciple isn't even bad
[1:56:41] <+RJay80> control your lust Mr. Y'pakk
[1:56:42] <DatAsuna> let's rebuild the cube
[1:56:45] <+Grayhammatter> did woolz buy the gamer cube?
[1:56:52] <%Madbearv> yes
[1:56:54] <@Squdnate> @Commando_Joe Let him discover that himself
[1:56:54] <DSD24> Dang it I wanted to make a Bloodborne joke
[1:56:56] <giga_bit> Disciple is really cool to talk with about space politics, and about nothing else past that.
[1:57:01] <Zathas> Mira is a stronger companion, but Hanharr is a more interesting character, if only by a little.
[1:57:02] <ThalosTheSoviet> SHOW US THE CUBE
[1:57:09] <Kiraklene> USE THE FORCE
[1:57:14] <Yaddabluh> woolie you aren't speced for dual wielding
[1:57:14] <KaiserMario> Hey Woolie! did you hear the latest Randy news?
[1:57:15] <KnivesEve> USE THE CUBE
[1:57:23] <R0dn3y> Battery dead?

[1:57:31] <ThalosTheSoviet> MORE CUBE
[1:57:36] <%lotharrio> @Madbearv No he is. He's just got several flavors of Wooliebait already, so the one that comes along and is sassing him as a, "I'm so capable and smart and clever" rubs him wrong.

[1:59:11] <Sedrelic> so hk counts
[1:59:13] <+jiggy_snipe> HK
[1:59:17] <alrobot2014> no, 4 because HK
[1:59:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hk is waifu
[1:59:24] <DSD24> Mira doesn't count
[1:59:29] <+RJay80> WoolieVS Cube
[1:59:36] <DatAsuna> HK is just a bro
[1:59:41] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Mira is not in the harem
[1:59:43] <KnivesEve> i thought mira wasnt part of the harem
[1:59:43] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
