[0:53:47] <%shadownightavery> Blaze is amazing yo. And she's next up, and I'm excited
[0:53:49] <+Hitorio> They say you can see Sonic's panties if you pause while he does spinning bird kick.
[0:53:51] <zenith0111> Woolie played with a Dev LUL no wonder he's a god
[0:53:53] <+TopTieramisu> it's too neon
[0:53:54] <+Gordon_Chow> @StreakThunderstorm are you guys going to implement throws soon?
[0:54:00] <BwdYeti> yes
[0:54:03] <arcforged> We'll get those in. Techs too.
[0:54:03] <+ilpeggiore_> this looks like a legit game
[0:54:08] <+Gordon_Chow> cool
[0:54:18] <+Hitorio> Marvel players, DBFZ players, BBTAG players, Skullgirls players
[0:54:18] <TigerClaws12> so send a copy to Maximilian Dood LUL
[0:54:19] <dickbuttwoman> Yo, imagine this game with 3 on 3
[0:54:26] <Starotter70> I heard sonic fighting game, the fuck is this?
[0:54:26] <Doc1790> Yo where can I download this game? I wanna show this shit to my friends.
[0:54:28] <+Hitorio> Skullgirls gave SonicFox his champion-caliber DBFZ skills
[0:54:30] <arcforged> Max said he wants to play, yeah
[0:54:33] <+TopTieramisu> go1 vs sanford kelly
[0:54:39] <TigerClaws12> oh my god
[0:54:40] <%gatorafan> I feel this is coming to YoVG soon
[0:54:42] <arcforged> You can get the game on our twitter. @ArcForged
[0:54:50] <Brofarian> Sonic Fox was literally made for this game
[0:54:52] <Doc1790> Alrighty thanks
[0:55:02] <Smileyhat> Not to kill the hype, but what are the odds this game is gonna catch a C&D?
[0:55:02] <Doc1790> I'll give you a follow too
[0:55:06] <arcforged> Thanks!
[0:55:13] <EuropanLamprey> why is woolies playing mugen?
[0:55:15] <arcforged> 214 L
[0:55:16] <Sphincter_Spelunker> but is Sonichu in this
[0:55:16] <BwdYeti> Sega is generally good about fangames, so we're not too worried about it
[0:55:17] <arcforged> M or H
[0:55:18] <heckengine> 100 % but just dont tell sega
[0:55:22] <dickbuttwoman> The breakdance he just did as a taunt
[0:55:32] <arkv01> @Smileyhat no c and d, segas cool
[0:55:33] <arcforged> @WoolieVersus 214 L M or H, L is the fastest
[0:55:36] <+Hitorio> I can just hear SonicFox's laugh while he's smothering you with disgusting mixups in this game
[0:55:38] <thebeatsandrhymes> this isn't a Mugen
[0:55:40] <Smileyhat> Oh that's cool
[0:55:44] <+DrunkenDice> what did I walk into lytALRIGHT
[0:55:52] <heckengine> pressing a buitton? in this fighting game? pfft
[0:56:06] <MainManJonadiah> Handin' out supers like candy!
[0:56:06] <%gatorafan> @smileyhat always present but not 100% since SEGA sometimes is a pretty cool dude
[0:56:32] <arcforged> SEGA likes fangames. We made this for the annual Sonic Fan Games Expo that has been going on for 20 years
[0:56:46] <+Hitorio> Somehow GO1 would find a way to block everything for 5 minutes straight
[0:56:51] <+Hitorio> and block unblockables
[0:56:52] <tacostarvedbeast> How can people make such good sonic games and Sega stuck in the Stone Age
[0:56:52] <Smileyhat> Yeah. I hope they stay cool with this, 'cause this game looks like a lot of fun.
[0:56:56] <+Gordon_Chow> considering the fact there are sonic fan game contests their probably fine
[0:56:59] <raveous> yeah sega's pretty damn good with fangames. I mean look at christian whitehead
