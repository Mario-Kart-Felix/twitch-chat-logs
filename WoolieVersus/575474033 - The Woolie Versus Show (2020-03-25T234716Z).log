[0:00:00] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Are they ok?
[0:00:01] <Deadmanslegacy> @stacemcgate yes
[0:00:04] <BYAKURENLOVER763> oh there we go
[0:00:11] <FluffyChicken74> EYYYYYYYY
[0:00:14] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Theyre ok
[0:00:16] <Jonny_Uppercut> WOOO! Kotor 2 is back ayaHYPE
[0:00:18] <heartlesshealer> !
[0:00:22] <%Pillagius> WOOOOO! Lie
[0:00:24] <%thebrotherhoodofnod> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie, do you think that both KOTORs deserve a remaster?
[0:00:31] <heartlesshealer> 👏👏
[0:00:37] <+dezimaly> That darth ate the stream, his hunger knows no bounds
[0:00:51] <+krispen_wa> If Woolie says that they deserve a remaster, will that automatically mean we get a remaster?
[0:00:52] <Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus There's a section of the main area you haven't checked out yet.
[0:00:56] <terminallyCapriciousz> Woo! Quarantine cast K2
[0:01:05] <heartlesshealer> it's great
[0:01:08] <GarbageNirvana> Thaaat's Star Wars
[0:01:12] <Deadmanslegacy> I look forward to watching this stream for hopefully the next 3 hours while I remod my skyrim.
[0:01:31] <+dezimaly> i just finished remodding my skryim actually
[0:01:31] <heartlesshealer> works with that grungy, half-assed future tech thing classic star wars has going on
[0:01:33] <+krispen_wa> Install the Devious mods and Sexlab
[0:01:47] <%Irridium> install clean faces
[0:01:48] <%siamzero94> aren't stormtrooper guns remodeled ww2 guns?
[0:01:52] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Dooku?
[0:01:53] <+krispen_wa> And especially the Bloodborne ported armor sets
[0:02:03] <StarlitStunner> vargDio_HF Its time
[0:02:07] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Dooku has the best Lightsaber IMO
[0:02:11] <StaceMcGate> I don't feel comfortable with Ahsoka in Mandalorian
[0:02:17] <+dezimaly> you a CBBE or a UNP king of person
[0:02:27] <+mankeyfigh> We good?
[0:02:29] <heartlesshealer> I've just been flat out ignoring Mandalorian
[0:02:31] <+krispen_wa> Get that BakaFactory UNP
[0:02:33] <heartlesshealer> is it any good?
[0:02:34] <+mankeyfigh> We good
[0:02:35] <Dangerzone979> For everything I hate about Kylo Ren his lightsaber is great
[0:02:37] <%CEGold> @StaceMcGate Same. I LOVE Ahsoka, but it just feels...weird
[0:02:50] <+krispen_wa> But it's Rosario Dawson thooooo
[0:02:59] <+mankeyfigh> What’s that about Ashoka?
[0:03:04] <+mankeyfigh> Just got here
[0:03:11] <mike_wate> Wollie verses needs more minorities not less! Bring back Reggie!
[0:03:17] <StaceMcGate> What I liked about Mandalorian was the lack of Jedi and Sith, but now its lost its individuality
[0:03:31] <%Irridium> KOTOR 1 also backwards compatible on xbone
[0:03:36] <zenith0111> Oh we back calebPog
[0:03:47] <+krispen_wa> Just give KOTOR III to Chris Avellone
[0:03:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Imagine if these games got the FF7 treatment
[0:04:03] <+mankeyfigh> @heartlesshealer I’ve only heard good things so it must be
[0:04:04] <TheVoltStrike> the saber is glued to the pal or something
[0:04:08] <heartlesshealer> holding object with open palm always looks weird
[0:04:14] <StaceMcGate> KOTOR 3 best case scenario would be Larian Studios
[0:04:26] <Visorak6> Larian kotor 3 would be NUT
[0:04:27] <Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Do a circle around the central pit
[0:04:27] <+Superspider51> as much as I'd love a remake or remaster they'd probably fuck it up, especially if they make a Kotor 3
[0:04:30] <+mankeyfigh> I refuse to get Disney+ till the Marvel shows roll in
[0:04:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thatd be sick
[0:04:32] <arkv01> kotor is on the PHONE?
[0:04:32] <startstoprepeat> if bioware makes a kotor 3, they'll pretend kotor 2 never happened
[0:04:34] <mike_wate> Star Wars but the Witcher
[0:04:34] <%Mindtrick_Matt> @BallerSwagBro9k That would be dope, but that doesn't fix that the originals are hard for people to access easily
[0:04:35] <arkv01> Wowee
[0:04:43] <+krispen_wa> Larian Kotor III would just be Divinity in Space
[0:04:44] <mike_wate> The Witcher but star wars
[0:04:46] <Gruhunchously> Go forward
[0:04:47] <jorniev> what did larian make?
[0:04:50] <heartlesshealer> But I mean like, is Mandalorian good good, or fan bait good?
[0:04:52] <StaceMcGate> @krispen_wa and the problem is?
[0:04:55] <Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Go forward just a bit
[0:04:55] <%siamzero94> lovely isn't it?
[0:04:57] <%Binary_Fireball> anyone else have isolation blues? WFH has demolished my relax environment. Woolie's audible velvet is the only solace left inside this crypt of an apartment
[0:04:58] <fangovafang> lil weezy kinda look like lil Wayne.I got some food at subway,it taste nothin like da train
[0:04:59] <+democrazyyy> swtor makes a lot right now off of whales
[0:05:12] <+dezimaly> i thought the mandalorian was a genuinly good show
[0:05:13] <Ignorableartist> When's SWOTOR Classic?
[0:05:17] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah but SWToR deserves to die
[0:05:18] <StaceMcGate> @heartlesshealer its decent enough, episodic adventures that people crave after that mess of the new sequels
[0:05:20] <Ifrit_13> Disney can eat my Ass
[0:05:23] <%siamzero94> why the fuck are they shoving jedi and sith everywhere?
[0:05:29] <+toastybites> WHAT
[0:05:30] <+krispen_wa> @StaceMcGate Because Baldur's Gate III doesn't look like Baldur's Gate at all
[0:05:35] <StaceMcGate> Because Jedi is part of the brand
[0:05:36] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Thats gross
[0:05:36] <+Superspider51> not even the movies call it her lightsaber
[0:05:41] <+libra_zero> how about that High Republic tho
[0:05:41] <%xcompleasedad> What bullshit
[0:05:41] <heartlesshealer> I'll take that into consideration next time I get a chance to watch
[0:05:46] <ralphfromdk> As long as there is SWtor, KotoR 3 is not happening :l
[0:05:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:05:49] <%Pillagius> Yea... Episode X - No Hope
[0:05:52] <%JohnAtDawn> UM EXCUSE ME JEDI ACADEMY
[0:05:54] <jorniev> wait larian what did they make
[0:05:55] <StaceMcGate> @krispen_wa agreed, even if it the combat resembles DND more
[0:05:56] <+mankeyfigh> Just file an OFFICIAL COMPLAINT
[0:05:57] <+toastybites> Could have just called it the Skywalker lightsaver
[0:05:59] <+Kriptin> High Republic would sound cool if it weren't disney
[0:06:00] <%siamzero94> OH BITCH PLEASE
[0:06:06] <heartlesshealer> I'm usually down for episodic shenanigans
[0:06:06] <ScreamLord> A New Hope died in the womb

[0:08:15] <SixthSun2> Revan: Shit, I wish I knew about those hatches
[0:08:21] <Gruhunchously> 2 is the Kreia answer

[0:08:44] <Ifrit_13> Killing him would be the biggest lightest side
[0:08:44] <PlainSimpleTailor> POCKETS
[0:08:51] <%siamzero94> Who cares?
[0:08:53] <olaksi> space salvage, you own it now
[0:08:53] <heartlesshealer> one is flat refusal, one is an insult
[0:08:54] <+dezimaly> the legacy is the ship keeps getting stolen
[0:08:56] <oyyzzo> at least you
[0:08:59] <Halospaz117> So this conversation is even better if you have both Atton AND Handmaiden
[0:09:00] <oyyzzo> 're giving a reason
[0:09:20] <Gruhunchously> Hmmm
[0:09:21] <+Superspider51> slight spoiler maybe but there's a bit more to the side quest if you give it to him
[0:09:26] <%Mindtrick_Matt> It's pretty funny what happens if you give it to him
[0:09:30] <+jiggy_snipe> that npc lol
[0:09:34] <%Pillagius> I bet there's persuasion somewhere involving telling him "there're assissins after me, and if you take the ship... They just might visit you by accident"
[0:09:38] <+mankeyfigh> Huh
[0:09:43] <zenith0111> Awe there's no Red Submarine? :(

[0:12:44] <Major_monotone> Midichlorians are stored in the breasts
[0:12:48] <%siamzero94> They are exchange, killing them is a kindness
[0:12:48] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:12:50] <+dezimaly> sarcastic query: Does any meatbag on this ship mind if I completely reverse this intruder's organ sytem.

[0:19:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:20:00] <%siamzero94> this will become relevant later
[0:20:04] <+Superspider51> Malachor is a moon
[0:20:06] <+jiggy_snipe> Sol 3 baby
[0:20:08] <Halospaz117> It varies I guess
[0:20:09] <+Deadpal> yavin is different
[0:20:13] <+Deadpal> Yavin has 4 moons
[0:20:14] <ThalosTheSoviet> BOTH ARE CORRECT
[0:20:14] <%siamzero94> the moon is sol3a
[0:20:15] <+GeneralHysterics> It could probably be used for both
[0:20:17] <AMWACloak> THE FIFTH MOON OF MALACHOR is a pretty sick name for something.
[0:20:17] <zenith0111> Never stop giving him the 3rd degree
[0:20:18] <+Manjove> good old Sol 3
[0:20:18] <+Deadpal> if you say a system it's different
[0:20:24] <heartlesshealer> moons have letters after the number
[0:20:24] <+Deadpal> within STAR WARS
[0:20:25] <SixthSun2> It can be, but not always, like Yavin 5 for instance
[0:20:25] <DocMadfox> It varies
[0:20:26] <+Deadpal> that's different.
[0:20:28] <subjectg> both designations are used in star wars
[0:20:30] <mistersups> Number is the Satellite of a named
[0:20:31] <+libra_zero> frankly it's all made up; there's no real standard as far as I'm aware
[0:20:37] <+Superspider51> it actually is the fifth moon of malachor though
[0:20:40] <+GeneralHysterics> Lil V Mills: SPACEBOI
[0:20:47] <heartlesshealer> Earth's moon would be Sol3a
[0:20:56] <usurper_sos> MY POWER
[0:20:57] <+dezimaly> !motivated
[0:20:57] <@Moobot> 748 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:20:57] <%Irridium> agni and rudra gettin' a free show
[0:20:58] <+Deadpal> Within star wars it's numbered moons not stars, within STAR TREK it's numbered based off suns, also irl that as well.
[0:20:58] <Ifrit_13> Might is RIGHT!
[0:21:04] <heartlesshealer> but yeah, no 'actual' standard
[0:21:06] <+krispen_wa> GODDAMN ATTON
[0:21:09] <tolloponik> how many planets you need to find before you start using name -#
[0:21:11] <+GeneralHysterics> easy there atton
[0:21:12] <%Pillagius> go on!
[0:21:20] <%siamzero94> Get it out there atton
[0:21:33] <+GeneralHysterics> DAMN DUDE
[0:21:34] <+Nomicro4u> Hate those space wizards
[0:21:35] <+krispen_wa> HOLY SHIT ATTON
[0:21:36] <hellkhat> what made him so pissed
[0:21:38] <Kirlrik> don't get me started on cargo ramps
[0:21:39] <+toastybites> stab him
[0:21:39] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Atton actually scares me a bit during this talk
[0:21:42] <Ifrit_13> Even the Younglings
[0:21:49] <SixthSun2> Those dirty Al Jhedi deserved it, bruddah
[0:21:49] <lotharrio> What about the young- dammit
[0:21:51] <%Pillagius> Go dr. Phil on him with option 2!
[0:21:53] <custoadian> meanwhile those two twi'leks are just standing there watching all this
[0:21:53] <usurper_sos> Especially the younglings
[0:21:54] <+WeirdKuSoge> They did deserve it tho lmao
[0:21:55] <zenith0111> Too be fair I also hate religious warriors
[0:21:55] <Halospaz117> MANY graves
[0:21:59] <zenith0111> Fuck the Jedi
[0:22:09] <+prime_name> I'm glad they died and I hope they burned in hell
[0:22:15] <prince_johnny_> Damn
[0:22:22] <zenith0111> Oh so Jedi are Soldiers
[0:22:24] <+vaporousTippler> Your brother was a bitch and so are you.
[0:22:28] <bigmacjack12> Atton posting some cringe here
[0:22:29] <arkv01> just talk
[0:22:30] <+krispen_wa> "Rational" Woolie option
[0:22:38] <Major_monotone> Just talk
[0:22:39] <GarbageNirvana> Woolie the Therapist
[0:22:41] <%siamzero94> he isn't, he was there
[0:22:43] <+WeirdKuSoge> 4 is the Edgy kid answer lel
[0:22:44] <+Deano8817> My character totally was a4
[0:22:44] <+Nomicro4u> R1
[0:22:45] <subjectg> WoolieVS and the Methods of Rationality
[0:22:48] <lotharrio> Someone tells a veteran of the Battle of Iwa Jima that everyone deserved death there and your only regret was more didn't die.
[0:22:51] <+Nomicro4u> R1 GLASS HIM
[0:22:57] <trickquestionz> No the Woolie option would be to drop trough and join in the shitting
[0:22:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AsinPersuasion
[0:23:06] <+GeneralHysterics> what the hell is that boomer wisdom, lol
[0:23:07] <heartlesshealer> hey Kreia
[0:23:10] <%Irridium> like that time someone told buzz aldrin he never landed on the moon and buzz just punched him LUL
[0:23:10] <subjectg> honestly 1 or 3 is my choice, for drama
[0:23:12] <Kirlrik> big truths
[0:23:12] <Jaku2011> Actual veteran won't take that shit
[0:23:13] <+AsinPersuasion> hell yeah
[0:23:16] <Gruhunchously> Ver4
[0:23:16] <OldManDeckardCain> atton is pretty woke on the jedi question
[0:23:17] <GarbageNirvana> Jedi are the 1%
[0:23:18] <Gruhunchously> 4
[0:23:18] <@SoushinSen> He looks like movie cyclops.
[0:23:19] <+krispen_wa> 4
[0:23:19] <RedAhoge> "I mean yeah, but-"
[0:23:20] <TheVoltStrike> HARD AGREE
[0:23:20] <+jiggy_snipe> Enlightened Woolie
[0:23:21] <Gruhunchously> Look at 4
[0:23:23] <%Pillagius> I agree with both Woolie and V. "Lets hear why you think like that... If I don't like it - you ded"
[0:23:25] <Redblood801> FROM MY POINT
[0:23:27] <CookieDoughFK> Eat the Jedi
[0:23:27] <+AsinPersuasion> pretzals lie. pretzals manipulate
[0:23:28] <prince_johnny_> LOL
[0:23:31] <+AsinPersuasion> revan knew snacks
[0:23:32] <DocMadfox> From MYYYYY
[0:23:40] <PlainSimpleTailor> Both Jedi and sith suck
[0:23:43] <+Bluemanzee> FROM MY
[0:23:44] <zenith0111> Fann is trying to argue a losing battle LUL
[0:23:45] <+mankeyfigh> 4
[0:23:46] <Ifrit_13> The Jedi are EVIL!
[0:23:56] <+AsinPersuasion> @WoolieVersus but woolie do jedi lie and manipulate?
[0:24:06] <zenith0111> "Guardians of peace"
[0:24:06] <+libra_zero> I wonder how much of Episode 3's story leaked into Obsidian offices
[0:24:09] <heartlesshealer> 4 seems the most natural, but not sure how much that affects the route
[0:24:12] <MichaelDood> .....I'd like to phone a friend!
[0:24:13] <+jiggy_snipe> he's not wrong *shrugs*
[0:24:17] <+GeneralHysterics> Bao Dur pretending to do maintenance on his droid
[0:24:17] <+Bluemanzee> Ur mom tho
[0:24:17] <CookieDoughFK> Redistribute the means to the force
[0:24:25] <+GeneralHysterics> "What're you guys talking about"
[0:24:27] <mistersups> *Grapple Away*
[0:24:28] <lotharrio> Woolie, electro-lariat is just Naruto again.
[0:24:32] <Djinnazz> Hellish Rebeuk!
[0:24:42] <+krispen_wa> Go 4
[0:24:43] <subjectg> meanwhile those two twileks have front row seats to the fireworks
[0:24:45] <GarbageNirvana> And how does that make you feel?
[0:24:56] <olaksi> Yeah, but there's a LOT anger to it
[0:24:58] <+krispen_wa> It's not evil tho
[0:25:00] <+jiggy_snipe> neutral
[0:25:00] <tolloponik> Quarrel BOMBER
[0:25:01] <Halospaz117> No it's fine
[0:25:04] <RedAhoge> *Glass him*
[0:25:04] <%siamzero94> it ain't
[0:25:08] <+krispen_wa> JUST DO 4
[0:25:08] <+mankeyfigh> 4
[0:25:08] <Halospaz117> Like it's actually fine, not even a joke
[0:25:09] <+WeirdKuSoge> That the whole point of the game, GREY SHIT
[0:25:09] <heartlesshealer> People saying it's neutral
[0:25:11] <CookieDoughFK> Its not eveil
[0:25:12] <+Deano8817> do it anyways
[0:25:13] <+MidnightBurst12> we can try
[0:25:13] <+WeirdKuSoge> not all EVIL and MUIH GOOD
[0:25:15] <+WeirdKuSoge> cmon now
[0:25:16] <Gruhunchously> Do it
[0:25:17] <usurper_sos> It is fine
[0:25:19] <%Pillagius> Well, a little red won't hurt your light complection, Woolie!
[0:25:20] <+jiggy_snipe> just do 2 then
[0:25:22] <DocMadfox> Not evil, but might end the convo
[0:25:22] <%alpharius88> those two guy's in the back dont know what to do like "should we leave or better to stay still and hope he doesnt see us"
[0:25:23] <zenith0111> Nit evil
[0:25:24] <Halospaz117> Don't rely on the placing of the phrase all the time
[0:25:24] <mistersups> John's gearing up that Baton!
[0:25:27] <trickquestionz> You've already lost a ton
[0:25:27] <+mankeyfigh> Nahh
[0:25:31] <Chisas_Dead_Body> What are the commands again?
[0:25:31] <+AsinPersuasion> god atton is so good
[0:25:33] <atema128> Not evil.
[0:25:33] <DocMadfox> Ok it's fine he keeps going
[0:25:35] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Atton
[0:25:36] <+krispen_wa> He didn't listen to what you said tho
[0:25:44] <heartlesshealer> shitty space cultists
[0:25:48] <+GeneralHysterics> damn son
[0:25:49] <+krispen_wa> JESUS
[0:25:53] <Ifrit_13> Preach it Atton!
[0:25:54] <indig0bird> Yeah, they're extemely dogmatic
[0:25:56] <%JohnAtDawn> BECUASE ATON TOTALLY REPRESENTS THE NORMAL GALACTIC PERSON
[0:25:57] <+Ell1ot> Jedi are peaceful except for when they're not
[0:26:00] <prince_johnny_> TALK YO SHIT
[0:26:07] <%JohnAtDawn> NOT BIASED AT ALL
[0:26:08] <Jaku2011> Oh shit
[0:26:16] <%Intersceptre> Intersceptre subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Cannot thank you, V, Pat etc enough for the content lately. Having to breach containment for work sucks right now, stuck between a deadly virus or no money, stress is high - Kotor session is the perfect tonic. Shine on doods.
[0:26:23] <heartlesshealer> but thou must
[0:26:24] <%JohnAtDawn> Pat was totally not taking this quote out of context
[0:26:26] <%siamzero94> let him ramble, he'll get there
[0:26:27] <indig0bird> To be fair, Atton is way overboard about this
[0:26:28] <zenith0111> Logic check : Sith = Not Jedi but Not Jedi doesn't equal sith
[0:26:29] <+KityLinn> so edge
[0:26:38] <indig0bird> Jedi = Sith is just fucking nuts
[0:26:50] <%JohnAtDawn> Yes, it is
[0:26:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:26:50] <%Pillagius> I'm pretty sure that's one of the moments where you get an extra option if you finish game twice: one for dark and one for light side
[0:26:53] <Djinnazz> OOoooo!
[0:26:54] <+KityLinn> this is the both sides meme
[0:26:56] <olaksi> @JohnAtDawn I think he was talking about a different scene
[0:26:57] <+Deadpal> lost reputation with atton
[0:26:57] <+GeneralHysterics> "best entertainment I've seen in weeks"
[0:27:19] <DocMadfox> So is murdering people for fun
[0:27:19] <CastellanVon> This is so both sides
[0:27:30] <+jiggy_snipe> he's a piece of shit but at least he doesn't hide it
[0:27:33] <+zetrexx> lol attons right tho
[0:27:38] <GarbageNirvana> Snidely Whiplash at least lets you know what he's about
[0:28:11] <RedAhoge> You can just see Rudra head peenai just pre-gooping
[0:28:16] <%JohnAtDawn> And to say taht normal people think Jedi=Sith is to be extremely out of touch or to have such a low opinion of people that you are one step above a misanthropist.
[0:28:49] <Chisas_Dead_Body> How long have we been styling for?
[0:28:53] <reonome> uhhhhhh
[0:28:54] <+GeneralHysterics> those people are sociopaths
[0:28:57] <+Deadpal> yes.
[0:28:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wonderful people
[0:29:00] <+Bluemanzee> Oof
[0:29:01] <+Deadpal> That's what people think of the sith.
[0:29:02] <+krispen_wa> AYN RAND INTENSIFIES
[0:29:02] <%JohnAtDawn> Wow you found a conservitive.
[0:29:02] <zenith0111> Tbf this whole conflict is over how to use their space wizard magic
[0:29:05] <+WeirdKuSoge> Logic = sociopath
[0:29:07] <+WeirdKuSoge> okay boomer
[0:29:08] <+mankeyfigh> No but people in this world really don’t know the difference
[0:29:08] <DocMadfox> Buying homeless dudes food is good
[0:29:12] <indig0bird> Why the fuck wouldn't you give charity?
[0:29:16] <atema128> Atton’s got a lot of baggage behind his worldview too that is coloring his rhetoric.
[0:29:18] <zenith0111> Their conflict is super stupid
[0:29:19] <Visorak6> except when they throw the food at you
[0:29:19] <+jiggy_snipe> i don't care what the homeless guy uses my money on
[0:29:20] <indig0bird> THAT'S SUPER TRUE
[0:29:23] <+wunp_fxs> be smaet about yoru charity and its fine
[0:29:24] <Badgerconda_> You know what man, if someone's fucking homeless, let them enjoy some fucking drugs.
[0:29:25] <+mankeyfigh> That’s why it’s called the “Jedi” Civil War
[0:29:26] <%Pillagius> yea... True
[0:29:26] <startstoprepeat> those people are idiots, your life's so shit on the streets that you can't judge whatever they've gotta do to get through the day
[0:29:33] <indig0bird> The high and mighty are the shittiest dipshits that there are
[0:29:35] <ThalosTheSoviet> theres also SCUMMY charities
[0:29:39] <+AsinPersuasion> i mean theres also the times where you go hey lemme buy you food and they flip out at you
[0:29:42] <fangovafang> 💯💯💯💯
[0:29:43] <Shardlab> The ego of wanting to feel right rather than doing something
[0:29:43] <GarbageNirvana> Kreia be on Twitter like
[0:29:47] <+ktothec99> That's often borne out of paranoia or a bad experience
[0:29:52] <%JohnAtDawn> @mankeyfigh It's called that because of actual ignorance.
[0:29:53] <ScareLampert> My big problem with the whole "Jedi are just as bad as Sith," is the fact that, at worst, the Jedi are scummy bastards. The Sith... blow up planets, on the regular.
[0:29:53] <heartlesshealer> good now vs scum later
[0:29:55] <DocMadfox> You can give a homeless dude food and fucking politic for social change
[0:29:55] <Otatoptohami> cant save up to get out of that situation with big macs
[0:29:56] <%alpacasintophats> alpacasintophats subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:29:57] <indig0bird> Epstein Charity for Youth Develompent
[0:29:58] <+WeirdKuSoge> From a man that never worked with the homeless, HILARIOUS
[0:30:04] <+WeirdKuSoge> you dont know nothing mate
[0:30:06] <Ifrit_13> My money will go where i want it to go and if i want to give it to a homeless man then i want to give it to a homeless man
[0:30:12] <+krispen_wa> Braun Strowman has entered the chat
[0:30:13] <+zetrexx> god fuck bootstrappers
[0:30:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Gundarium Bootsraps
[0:30:20] <Retinolgaming> BOOTSTRAP YOURSELF POORS
[0:30:20] <arkv01> B Gundam IKIMASU
[0:30:30] <+Deadpal> Yes.
[0:30:31] <+KityLinn> isn't that the kreia argument
[0:30:33] <reonome> i don't even like boots :(
[0:30:35] <ScareLampert> Is Dio worse than Funny Valentine?
[0:30:35] <+Deadpal> It's worse.
[0:30:37] <Gruhunchously> @ScareLampert But the Sith blowing up planets used to call themselves Jedi.
[0:30:39] <+kaiju7544> Forget KOTOR2 I’m here for the philosophy class
[0:30:41] <indig0bird> The clouded person can become unclouded
[0:30:43] <GarbageNirvana> @WeirdKuSoge I know that there's scumfucks out there just looking to take advantage, and I also know I got too much going on in my own life to scrutinize everyone
[0:30:43] <usurper_sos> 00 Bootstraps
[0:30:44] <+Deadpal> It is worse to be clear eyed and do wrong.
[0:30:44] <Matermind0> My bootstraps are not bound by gravity
[0:30:44] <Djinnazz> Sensui or Yusuke
[0:30:46] <Monkeyweed21> There is the caveat that most homeless sleeping in the streets are not in shelters due to being hardcore addicts/fucking crazy. And by giving them food you are enabling them to continue refusing help from shelters and soup kitchens
[0:30:47] <zenith0111> Then are they even clouded???
[0:30:54] <zenith0111> I don't get the question
[0:30:55] <OldManDeckardCain> I hate how people on either side of this argument just make it seems simple when it's complicated as fuck
[0:30:56] <+Deadpal> ????
[0:31:01] <97thJackle> Do wrong
[0:31:02] <CastellanVon> Is it worse to torture that homeless guy that asks for money or to act high and might? Cuz that's the sith thing.
[0:31:08] <SixthSun2> Murder 1 ?
[0:31:09] <Shardlab> It's mad complicated
[0:31:10] <indig0bird> The "bootstraps" guy can fuck a shotgun and pull the trigger
[0:31:14] <+zetrexx> monkeyweed thats such a shit ass take lol tf r u talking about
[0:31:15] <CastellanVon> Sith is stupid evil
[0:31:25] <CookieDoughFK> First degree Murder, not Murder 1
[0:31:29] <lotharrio> Doing wrong with full intention is worse than someone who is trying to help and doesn't know what they're doing. The first guy is less annoying, but he's definitely a worse person.
[0:31:33] <+mankeyfigh> @monkeyweed21 Is that a statistic, cause that don’t sound right
[0:31:44] <+taggerung403> i feel like a persons actions should mean the most
[0:31:44] <TheVoltStrike> bootstraps?
[0:31:48] <+ktothec99> hypocrisy and ignorance are different things
[0:31:50] <+GeneralHysterics> this game is creating some of the best lp content I've seen in a long time.
[0:31:52] <+AsinPersuasion> the generalization is wrong, but you can't say thats an uncommon possibility
[0:31:57] <Shardlab> Ambitious evil has logic behind it, stupid evil is just being absorbed in passionate smugness
[0:32:00] <+TomDanksEGOT> the overwhelming majority of the time you do not go to a psych ward isntead of jail for a crime of passion
[0:32:03] <Ignorableartist> Woolie go on CHAPO
[0:32:03] <+jiggy_snipe> the Sith are worse than the Jedi but the Jedi are annoying
[0:32:06] <+mankeyfigh> The Jedi are assholes and not evil, and the Sith are assholes AND EVIL
[0:32:09] <+TomDanksEGOT> theres just lower maximums
[0:32:10] <+dezimaly> welcome to the podcast everyone
[0:32:14] <indig0bird> You can improve on Jedi philosophy by telling them they're full of shit, Sith are literally stupid evil
[0:32:15] <reonome> is this still about star wars
[0:32:27] <%Pillagius> Mind flexing so good
[0:32:31] <indig0bird> But Sith also have full confidence on themselves tho
[0:32:33] <Darth_Mama> Yoda is a good person
[0:32:41] <+zetrexx> yoda is a war criminal
[0:32:42] <zenith0111> It's far too nuanced to have a hard answer.
[0:32:44] <Kirlrik> sith are nice
[0:32:45] <time_axis> this entire discussion is just the plot of UBW
[0:32:46] <reonome> yoda is a dumb bitch
[0:32:46] <trickquestionz> If someone knows they're bad you can just shoot them
[0:32:47] <zenith0111> Depends on context.
[0:32:50] <fangovafang> Real psychology thing
[0:32:53] <+ktothec99> Isnt' Jedi vs Sith just Moralism vs Egotism?
[0:32:58] <indig0bird> Yoda is definitely not. He was the leader of the Order while they allowed the worst war crimes possible happen
[0:33:07] <@SoushinSen> fuck the priests in castlevania anime.
[0:33:08] <Monkeyweed21> @mankeyfigh Shelters require you to get clean to use them so that crackheads dont steal everything for crack money, and there are multiple shelters in my city that are significantly under capacity as a result, in addition to the mentally ill who refuse help
[0:33:09] <+AsinPersuasion> saying this is UBW is a stretch
[0:33:10] <GarbageNirvana> You can always trust a dishonest person to be dishonest
[0:33:13] <resloxxx> It's always harder to deal with a traitor than an enemy
[0:33:15] <%jinking79> i have to do this evil act to save the world
[0:33:19] <royb2> This is coming from the guys with the "light side later" policy
[0:33:24] <RedAhoge> Example of bad thinking they good: Justice bitch from Akame ga kill
[0:33:24] <+mankeyfigh> What did Yoda actually do? In the movies, he’s kinda useless isn’t he?
[0:33:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I disagree V, someone who is honest about their self interest is less willing to change because they have no incentive to change their bad behavior
[0:33:28] <Shardlab> Fuck those priests for real
[0:33:29] <+dezimaly> why is yoda a war criminal
[0:33:35] <+Bluemanzee> AT-ATton
[0:33:36] <ScareLampert> "I have to keep this slave to dance for my money, for the greater good."
[0:33:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> An ingorant do-gooder can be educated to do better
[0:33:50] <+AsinPersuasion> he led the jedi philosophy of the prequels
[0:33:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:33:52] <ScareLampert> Oh, sorry, not slave dancer. ATM.
[0:34:00] <Kirlrik> but MAYBE hitler was right
[0:34:01] <+AsinPersuasion> and then spent time trying to figure out what went wrong in the swamp
[0:34:02] <Monkeyweed21> @mankeyfigh I agree with giving homeless people food/money/help individually but there is a counter arguement that you are enabling them to not get clean and continue refusing help
[0:34:06] <royb2> YOu're saying this while having a slave ATM for the greater good
[0:34:06] <%siamzero94> Yoda is too rooted in the jedi philosophy of letting the force guide them, when the force in the end doesn't really care
[0:34:07] <+AsinPersuasion> in the og trilogy
[0:34:17] <zenith0111> Is this even about the sith and jedi anymore?
[0:34:18] <GKannel> would Jedis be Lawful Neutral
[0:34:19] <GKannel> ?
[0:34:20] <Darth_Mama> He broke his ways and thinking to train Luke
[0:34:29] <+krispen_wa> I want to get attached to Atton
[0:34:29] <+mankeyfigh> And then he OHKOs the sacred texts
[0:34:46] <%Binary_Fireball> EATS CAKE
[0:34:50] <indig0bird> Jedi would be either Lawful Neutral or True neutral with a tendency to theirown code
[0:34:51] <%Binary_Fireball> and has it too
[0:34:51] <+GeneralHysterics> bof
[0:34:54] <%siamzero94> both
[0:34:54] <+mankeyfigh> @darth_mama Did he?
[0:34:55] <+dezimaly> but WHY is he a war criminal? being a bad leader is not a war crime
[0:34:56] <GarbageNirvana> Nobody knows what it's like, to be the baaad maaan
[0:35:01] <+KityLinn> pfff feelings
[0:35:17] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie don't you own a slave
[0:35:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @GKannel there is no mandated in the Jedi, all are individuals and are given enough freedom to develop their own ideologies
[0:35:28] <jnaynnay> mrfeel1Monokumafloss mrfeel1Monokumafloss mrfeel1Monokumafloss
[0:35:31] <Overloard> he seent the whole thing
[0:35:33] <OldManDeckardCain> yoda is less of a war criminal than obama LUL
[0:35:40] <ScareLampert> @Monkeyweed21 It's fine, though. Greater Good.
[0:35:42] <+taggerung403> the best jedi would be lawful good, the worst would be lawful stupid
[0:35:42] <tolloponik> how old is Atton
[0:36:01] <+AsinPersuasion> how long is it going to take woolie to figure out atton was sith
[0:36:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[0:36:02] <%siamzero94> about mid 30s i would guess
[0:36:02] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 7 minutes
[0:36:05] <+mankeyfigh> How old is Atton?
[0:36:10] <+libra_zero> Malachor V was the BIG LOSS for the Mandos
[0:36:23] <lotharrio> Revan, presumably, fell before Malachor but his objective was still to beat on the Mandalorians.
[0:36:26] <%Pillagius> So... Apparently Malachor V was clustercluck
[0:36:27] <Make_me_mad> Woolie's brain weak
[0:36:29] <zenith0111> I'm on the side that all force users are just prententious and involving everyone in a religious war..
[0:36:37] <+AsinPersuasion> woolie's brain is hella weak
[0:36:39] <Darth_Mama> Would Baby Yoda authorize drone strikes?
[0:36:53] <trickquestionz> All that slavery has weakened his brain
[0:37:00] <+AsinPersuasion> have they done the "why did revan fall" talk with kreia?
[0:37:02] <%JohnAtDawn> Except ToR retconned that
[0:37:05] <indig0bird> Jesus fuck, trick
[0:37:13] <jorniev> does malachor V give revan the biggest kill count?
[0:37:13] <indig0bird> Oh, nevermind
[0:37:15] <+krispen_wa> Fuck ToR
[0:37:16] <+libra_zero> Revan was like "so now that I've beaten these guys..."
[0:37:16] <Jaku2011> @asinpersuasion ya
[0:37:26] <+zetrexx> god fuck tor
[0:37:27] <+MrRabbles> Revan: ight imma head out
[0:37:28] <jorniev> no
[0:37:33] <jorniev> YOU DID TOOO
[0:37:33] <zenith0111> But if there's already war... what else do you do?
[0:37:36] <olaksi> It kind of is
[0:37:38] <Make_me_mad> Those first two are the biggest hypcritical things to say.
[0:37:40] <zenith0111> Not do the war?
[0:37:50] <+pectusumbra> Like JETPACKS WOOLIE?
[0:37:59] <+jiggy_snipe> gotta feed the war economy with more war Kappa
[0:38:01] <%Binary_Fireball> Betrayal for the right reasons isn't betrayal at all
[0:38:02] <trickquestionz> Wait, what did the Republic do wrong? They were just defending themselves from the Mandos and asked the Jedi for help
[0:38:04] <damienlunas> Where's the "You did what you thought was right" option
[0:38:04] <bigmacjack12> What right reasons?
[0:38:05] <%bread_assassin> But that's what YOU did.
[0:38:11] <GarbageNirvana> I feel like all of these are gonna be hit with "NO U"
[0:38:12] <%Binary_Fireball> hierarchy of values and all that
[0:38:13] <Visorak6> 2 is super hypocritical because its the same argument Atris used against you
[0:38:28] <zenith0111> @damienlunas Simple answer with a lot of nuance
[0:38:31] <lotharrio> The Jedi civil war was a grudge, for most people.
[0:38:32] <%CEGold> AND MILLIONS!!!
[0:38:32] <+krispen_wa> 2 isn't hypocritical because there was no reason to go to war at the end of the Mando wars tho
[0:38:37] <Kirlrik> and it was SICK
[0:38:39] <+krispen_wa> well other than SPOIELRS
[0:38:39] <+slunkymcgee> I feel bad for these two twilek who've been made a captive audience to this outburst
[0:38:43] <subjectg> 2 can be reasoned that you saw good intentions going to war with the mandos
[0:38:57] <subjectg> however atton and revan’s war was for revenge
[0:39:02] <%CEGold> LUL
[0:39:03] <DocMadfox> I love "SHIT'S STILL ON FIRE!"
[0:39:04] <trickquestionz> "So then we all turned around and killed the Republic.
[0:39:11] <indig0bird> Serrocco was nuked, with actual nuclear weapons, until the planet got wasted
[0:39:17] <+libra_zero> It's like a coal mine fire, or an oil rig fire
[0:39:18] <fangovafang> deep
[0:39:21] <OldManDeckardCain> it can't be cool if it's on fire tho Kappa
[0:39:25] <+PaladinDupre> Like that coal mine
[0:39:26] <mistersups> There's that one Pennsylvania town
[0:39:29] <%siamzero94> "yeah it was sick and we didn't want the party to end"
[0:39:35] <zenith0111> 1 is just saying " You're evil"
[0:39:35] <+MidnightBurst12> like that one town in Pennsylvania
[0:39:37] <subjectg> Centralia’s still burning
[0:39:40] <bigmacjack12> Woolie, i need you to go read the KOTOR comic book where the bombing of serrocco happens
[0:39:41] <%CEGold> @OldManDeckardCain big brain thinking right there PogChamp
[0:39:45] <+mankeyfigh> 2
[0:39:47] <subjectg> and that big hole somewhere in russia
[0:40:03] <lotharrio> Revan was paying them right out of her POCKETS
[0:40:05] <olaksi> Being loyal to a general isn't really a good reason to turn on the republic
[0:40:15] <indig0bird> Russia is a huge crater in Steven Universe lol
[0:40:17] <+GeneralHysterics> Charismatic generals are terribly dangerous. See: Caesar
[0:40:28] <+GeneralHysterics> Also Washington
[0:40:31] <indig0bird> @GeneralHysterics TRUUUUUEE
[0:40:35] <lotharrio> Illegal orders are a thing, Atton.
[0:40:36] <Amardeux> !uptime
[0:40:36] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 12 minutes
[0:40:37] <+krispen_wa> Also Senator Armstrong
[0:40:40] <%CEGold> @indig0bird "Youre gonna censor us? Then we'll censor YOU!" Rebecca Sugar, probably
[0:40:45] <zenith0111> The problem I have with the world building is that besides blowing up planets I don't get the empires end goal.
[0:40:51] <trickquestionz> Why did you want to kill the Republic though? THEY didn't abandon you!
[0:40:51] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:40:52] <CastellanVon> See Napoleon
[0:41:13] <indig0bird> @CEGold "Cancelled" Becky Sucrose, probably
[0:41:35] <subjectg> @zenith0111 you could say that their goals are the same as the republic: galactic peace, with a side of xenophobia and authoritarian rule
[0:41:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> V: "Propoganda is powerfull" Woolie: "Yeah, but...." Woolie casually dismissing propoganda
[0:41:41] <+mankeyfigh> I feel like this conversation would be more interesting if they made the Canon light side Revan
[0:41:45] <trickquestionz> I mean if Revan wants to kill the Jedi, fine, but why does Revan suddenly want to make herself queen of the galaxy.
[0:41:46] <%siamzero94> The Republic didn't beat the mandalorians, it was Revan. And they swore loyalty to hime/her alone
[0:41:55] <+AsinPersuasion> woolie brainlet
[0:41:58] <indig0bird> Revan Hime
[0:42:10] <+GeneralHysterics> Damn son
[0:42:14] <%CEGold> @Admiral_PopnFresh Are we really shocked that Woolie "What does the Hat get in Swordmaster?" Madden brushed pass that LUL
[0:42:16] <reonome> metal
[0:42:16] <zenith0111> @subjectg Yeah like that time they hired all those Alien Bounty Hunters?

[0:43:05] <+mankeyfigh> WHOA
[0:43:05] <DocMadfox> Big Barth
[0:43:05] <%JohnAtDawn> He is literally saying "we had good reasons" in one second, and then gleefuly talking about torture the next.
[0:43:07] <+zabando> This man has a hard-on for jedi murder.
[0:43:08] <Halospaz117> IS HE STILL BARTH NOW?
[0:43:09] <subjectg> Atton is a great subversion of the Solo-type
[0:43:13] <trickquestionz> Atton was a fucking black ops, hardcore Sith Empire SS torture marine, hot damn
[0:43:13] <%siamzero94> So Atton's class is actually Sith Assassin
[0:43:15] <tolloponik> From Simp to Boss!
[0:43:18] <arkv01> attons seen a lot of ahegao in his day...
[0:43:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Echani battle stance Kappa
[0:43:22] <Retinolgaming> @WoolieVersus Now Compare him to Carth LUL
[0:43:24] <%jinking79> u sure your not still on that hate boner
[0:43:26] <Graywolf_the_45th> This boy ain't a Carth, He ain't a Barth, He's an Aarth.
[0:43:27] <+Superspider51> so john is having a fucking symphony in Atton's head right now
[0:43:31] <atema128> Really love Atton being a secret psychopath.
[0:43:32] <+AsinPersuasion> woolie.exe has stopped working
[0:43:35] <+krispen_wa> Atton was just straight up Unit 731

[0:43:38] <SixthSun2> Uh, excuse you NPC guy
[0:43:42] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Does he look like a bitch?

[0:43:47] <RedAhoge> Fk the jjedi
[0:43:50] <GarbageNirvana> Order 66 said no the fuck they ain't
[0:43:52] <+libra_zero> The kicker? He's LIGHT SIDE NOW
[0:43:53] <Overloard> barth bragging about gasing the jedi is hilarious
[0:43:54] <pan_nochal> what if you just keep pumping in the gas
[0:43:56] <trickquestionz> Atton is a fucking hardcore space nazi gestapo.
[0:43:56] <a_mad_dragon> don't forget all the jedi that got hard fucked when the clones turned on them
[0:43:57] <jorniev> atton el matón
[0:43:58] <lotharrio> Kill their friends to make them distracted, which makes it REAL easy for them to lose control of their powers.
[0:44:00] <subjectg> “And if Jedi can be fooled... then they can be killed.”
[0:44:03] <Redblood801> Mentally abuse them until they turn
[0:44:03] <pan_nochal> you want to use Raid, the green can works best
[0:44:04] <jorniev> order 66
[0:44:09] <DocMadfox> Shoot them A LOT
[0:44:09] <Djinnazz> Yo, we're discussing something here, do you mind sir!?
[0:44:12] <ScareLampert> A Jedi is invincible... in a fair fight. So you don't fight fair.
[0:44:12] <%Pillagius> Well, yunglings certainly didn't have plot armor! cohhBot cohhBot
[0:44:17] <zenith0111> Turns out the Republic was the Empire
[0:44:19] <jorniev> hk nows about that shit
[0:44:20] <+taggerung403> order 66 was like 10000 vs 1
[0:44:23] <DocMadfox> You aren't deflecting a wall of blaster fire
[0:44:23] <Redblood801> You cant dodge everything
[0:44:27] <arkv01> jedi gotta sleep too
[0:44:29] <+mankeyfigh> In da back
[0:44:34] <trickquestionz> It's like how stand users can totally get recked by regular damage
[0:44:35] <+jiggy_snipe> you can outnumber them
[0:44:37] <SixthSun2> well, the thing with Order 66 is that the clones fought alongside the Jedi for awhile and understood how the Jedi fight,
[0:44:39] <zenith0111> So if you were with the Republic you are helping palpitine
[0:44:44] <%Pillagius> Just place a bunch of mines! :D
[0:44:46] <astrofalcon1> ok but what if you were a sith
[0:44:47] <pan_nochal> what if you wait for them until they get back on the ship... and then blow up the ship
[0:44:47] <+cvp5127> lie cheat steal
[0:44:49] <+KityLinn> lol
[0:44:53] <heartlesshealer> "Hey Atton, maybe you should buddy up with this droid we just repaired."
[0:44:54] <Halospaz117> OOOO GOSSIP
[0:44:57] <+BionoidLCR> @WoolieVersus you have a conversation like that with HK in the first game not sure if you got it cant remember
[0:44:57] <DocMadfox> HK has a whole thing on killing Jedi and says outnumbering them with blaster fire works
[0:44:57] <lotharrio> Order 66 is all about a sudden turn from people who genuinely trusted and liked the Jedi, which is why they all looked so confused.
[0:44:58] <arkv01> yo that npc wants some PAZAAK
[0:45:01] <subjectg> You can also make the argument that the Jedi during the clone wars were weaker and more complacent than their older counterparts
[0:45:01] <trickquestionz> And sometimes they just blow up their ships or fire artillery at them.
[0:45:01] <+PaladinDupre> Jedi hard countered by a shotgun
[0:45:03] <%siamzero94> He's getting hyped about it
[0:45:06] <%CEGold> I kind of want to see Woolie and V play Fallen Order
[0:45:08] <%jinking79> Darth Vader can walk around without breathing machine on
[0:45:08] <vaderxyz1970> Woolie look up the Rebellions plan to kill Darth Vader
[0:45:09] <lotharrio> SITH is a hell of a drug.
[0:45:10] <R3c0n31> Now he is super Red side over the line
[0:45:11] <+AsinPersuasion> pure pazaak bby
[0:45:12] <jorniev> to be fair those people fought along side each other for YEAARS
[0:45:13] <CastellanVon> This game came out before Revenge of the Sith. And HK47 has a talk that basically predicted Order 66.
[0:45:15] <mihokspawn> Imagine someone strolling in and killing Bao, Atton and Handmaiden
[0:45:15] <+krispen_wa> You ENJOY all the killing!
[0:45:19] <arkv01> evillak!
[0:45:20] <astrofalcon1> sith is pretty op
[0:45:22] <heartlesshealer> yeah, the pit
[0:45:24] <%gatorafan> So, wanna play Pazaak?
[0:45:33] <ouijabirdz> I once beat a Jedi so bad in pazaak that he died
[0:45:42] <Jaku2011> Jumped all the way past the cliff
[0:45:44] <+jiggy_snipe> i dont read 1 that way
[0:45:47] <fangovafang> silly
[0:45:49] <zenith0111> 1 is more like " HOW COULD YOU?!"
[0:45:52] <Djinnazz> 'Blue Bird'!
[0:45:53] <+AsinPersuasion> i think 1 is more "i can't believe you would do something so horrible"
[0:45:59] <+krispen_wa> Stone Cold
[0:46:00] <%JohnAtDawn> JohnAtDawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Anton is literally saying "we had good reasons to betray the Republic" in one second, and then gleefully talking about torturing Jedi the next. Hey, can you tell the guy that wrote this game hates Star Wars yet?
[0:46:01] <+GeneralHysterics> Cold blooded
[0:46:08] <+ejn127> wow ok

[0:46:41] <Major_monotone> The most dangerous game of all: JEDI
[0:46:44] <pan_nochal> pure pazaak
[0:46:45] <AMWACloak> So we're all aware that Atton knows exactly what happened on Peragus when Kreia lost her arm and you felt it?
[0:46:47] <+CycloneEternalJoker> Atton is one with the edge
[0:46:47] <%Irridium> god I fucking love this game
[0:46:48] <+cvp5127> break their spirit first
[0:46:49] <zenith0111> Shoot that child Soldier!
[0:46:49] <usurper_sos> WAR CRIME BOIS
[0:46:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @trickquestionz
[0:46:50] <+mankeyfigh> The younglings....
[0:46:50] <Ifrit_13> Revolver Atton Ocelot
[0:46:51] <+GeneralHysterics> The child was the target the whole time
[0:46:53] <+GeneralHysterics> damn
[0:46:53] <+libra_zero> yeah just break the child soldier's arm to mess up the grownup child soldier
[0:46:53] <+Ell1ot> hey, you're killing three birds with one stone
[0:46:54] <astrofalcon1> kill the child
[0:46:55] <lotharrio> Carth=Republic soldier. Barth=Sith raised Jedi assassin.
[0:46:56] <ScareLampert> Spoilers for MHA. If you've seen it, you know what I'm referencing.
[0:46:57] <%Pillagius> So brutal! Love it!
[0:47:00] <heartlesshealer> Atton prefers the "Horsechopper" weapon in tabletop rpgs
[0:47:01] <zenith0111> Kill that religious child Soldier!
[0:47:08] <ScareLampert> I don't even have to SAY the spoiler.
[0:47:08] <zenith0111> Wtf jedi
[0:47:16] <+BionoidLCR> GO ON
[0:47:16] <+pectusumbra> catching this live was so worth. I showed up RIGHT ON TIME
[0:47:17] <+krispen_wa> "TELL ME MORE ABOUT MURDER"
[0:47:17] <%siamzero94> @AMWACloak Well a force bond like that is very unique
[0:47:17] <Overloard> barth "just stab the youngling"
[0:47:18] <Make_me_mad> 2!
[0:47:18] <RedAhoge> boooo
[0:47:20] <trickquestionz> Atton confirmed worse than Stroheim
[0:47:21] <+Superspider51> the way his voice actor says this shit makes him sound extra sadistic
[0:47:25] <damienlunas> 3: But why male models?
[0:47:26] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> plot
[0:47:26] <startstoprepeat> 2's a good
[0:47:26] <+toastybites> 1
[0:47:27] <+mankeyfigh> @scarelampert I’ve read all of MHA AND I have no idea
[0:47:28] <astrofalcon1> alright but if it were someone cool?
[0:47:31] <+jiggy_snipe> 3 is shock btw
[0:47:33] <heartlesshealer> the route probably needs 2
[0:47:36] <%Pillagius> well this answer is probably "How could you do it!?"
[0:47:39] <olaksi> LUL
[0:47:41] <zenith0111> Tbf the jedi put the younglings on the front lines LUL sooooo..
[0:47:42] <Redblood801> Anakin would
[0:47:45] <+zetrexx> jdfkjsdfkjdf yeah thats the anakin answer
[0:47:49] <+cvp5127> easily
[0:47:52] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[0:47:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:47:53] <astrofalcon1> anakin would totally and did
[0:47:56] <ScareLampert> @mankeyfigh Overhaul did it. Does that help?
[0:48:04] <+Bluemanzee> From MY
[0:48:05] <%CEGold> "From my perspective..."
[0:48:06] <Make_me_mad> 2 for more sick anti-jedi strats.
[0:48:07] <%gatorafan> But why? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:48:07] <+mankeyfigh> Oh yeah
[0:48:07] <+GeneralHysterics> What a heel turn THAT was
[0:48:08] <usurper_sos> What have I done?
[0:48:10] <olaksi> Lawful Dumb
[0:48:12] <+RICE02> Natalie Portman though
[0:48:16] <pan_nochal> pledging my loyality to the graveyard smash
[0:48:24] <Djinnazz> Evening? like an hour!
[0:48:24] <%Pillagius> yeap
[0:48:26] <%siamzero94> yeah it's kinda super rushed
[0:48:27] <subjectg> They did have good intentions, but their teachings were flawed
[0:48:33] <GarbageNirvana> THE SUN IS DOWN
[0:48:33] <Redblood801> The Clone Wars retroactively make the prequels a bit better.
[0:48:34] <+taggerung403> the novelisation sells it pretty good
[0:48:38] <zenith0111> That's why the Clone Wars tv was so great. They fixed Anakin
[0:48:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie's hatred of stuffy shirts has put him in the company of some shady people
[0:48:40] <+Starlight_Gamer> LUL
[0:48:43] <SinnerBeta> big dick Sheev charisma
[0:48:47] <Overloard> in the span of a montage anakin heel turned
[0:48:47] <Graywolf_the_45th> Mace through the Windu
[0:48:49] <zenith0111> They gave more context to his change
[0:48:51] <%CEGold> Clone Wars!Anakin is great
[0:48:53] <+Zyquux> Am I the baddie? - Anakin
[0:48:53] <pan_nochal> Kit Fisto's dead... time to leave it all behind
[0:48:55] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Anakin doesn't commit halfway okay. IF he is gonna be sith he is gonna go all in
[0:48:56] <atema128> The Clone Wars and the RotS novelization are great.
[0:48:57] <+BionoidLCR> @Graywolf_the_45th gold LUL
[0:48:58] <+libra_zero> TBF Palps was working him for a good long while before that
[0:49:00] <Razeino> I never bought Anakins fall which made the prequels fall completely apart for me.
[0:49:01] <RedAhoge> MeatCanyon Anakin is canon
[0:49:03] <usurper_sos> All too easy
[0:49:04] <Bruno_Tropical> ANANKIN KILLED CHILDREN SANDPEOPLE
[0:49:13] <arkv01> BIG HORNY
[0:49:16] <subjectg> I always saw it as sunk cost fallacy, since he killed windu there’s no going back
[0:49:16] <+mankeyfigh> The books did a better job too
[0:49:20] <%siamzero94> UNLIMITED PAZAAK!
[0:49:28] <+zetrexx> impossible to mindfuck
[0:49:28] <damienlunas> Throw up a WALL OF DICKS IN YOUR MIND.
[0:49:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> If you are screaming how horny you are, the Jedi can't read your mind Kappa
[0:49:30] <Scrub_Seeker> ...lust?
[0:49:32] <arkv01> just hide all the tech with anime TIDDY
[0:49:33] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Anakin kills super hard in The Clone Wars too
[0:49:39] <Bruno_Tropical> Anakin slaughtered the sandpeople
[0:49:40] <trickquestionz> "Atton murders children and monks while sporting a massive boner."
[0:49:42] <usurper_sos> Just be horny all the time
[0:49:42] <%Pillagius> So Atton has a large star wars twilekhub library in his head huh?
[0:49:44] <+jiggy_snipe> lots of lust LUL
[0:49:52] <RedAhoge> play Sonic 06 in the brains
[0:49:54] <+taggerung403> permachub
[0:49:57] <damienlunas> Just picture every Jedi you meet naked
[0:49:58] <+MrRabbles> being horny on main is the only way to defeat jedi
[0:49:58] <arkv01> jedi fuckers
[0:50:03] <+GeneralHysterics> Murder boner Atton is my FAVORITE
[0:50:04] <+mankeyfigh> So Atton’s personality is a LIE
[0:50:05] <Overloard> jedi fuckers
[0:50:06] <heartlesshealer> 3 just to slap him in the face with memories of Kreia
[0:50:13] <+cvp5127> thuggery
[0:50:20] <Redblood801> Designed to kill space wizard samurai
[0:50:21] <subjectg> He ain’t a soldier anymore, that’s an assassin
[0:50:22] <pan_nochal> shoot Voldemort with a 50. cal
[0:50:23] <atema128> “Indignities” as Kreia would put it
[0:50:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie, canonically, you've been fighting little Attons the entire game
[0:50:26] <+SolidusRex> Atton has a pretty big boner for the female PC
[0:50:29] <olaksi> But you just need a stun rod to fight jedi 1-on-1?
[0:50:31] <TheMostAverageGamer4> how far are they in the game?
[0:50:31] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's so interesting that he just drops the han soloesque persona here, like the persona itself is the shield he's describing
[0:50:31] <+zetrexx> the inquisitors have nothing on atton
[0:50:32] <Overloard> star wars equivalent of men who stare at goats
[0:50:42] <mistersups> I like to think Woolie and Little V's commentary are from the red and blue Twi'lekks in the back right now.
[0:50:53] <astrofalcon1> *unsheathes katana* heh nothing personal
[0:50:57] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Don't forget Teras Kasi @WoolieVersus its canon now
[0:50:58] <+AsinPersuasion> female exile and atton pseudo romance with atton dying is absolute kino
[0:51:03] <%CEGold> @mistersups Bruh PogChamp
[0:51:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @zanzibarian_hamster @mistersups I love both those comments
[0:51:08] <heartlesshealer> That blue on the menu screen was a smokescreen
[0:51:14] <ScareLampert> ... Stupid question, but do we get anybody who kills SITH like this? It feels like we only get edgelords who wanna "put those goody-goody Jedi their place".
[0:51:14] <subjectg> as it’s always been, the only thing that mattered in Star Wars was between Jedi
[0:51:25] <zenith0111> So as the Jedi were fighting the sith and the mandos they were also in a civil war?
[0:51:27] <olaksi> @AsinPersuasion The better reylo
[0:51:28] <arkv01> lucky ted was a sith lord all along...
[0:51:29] <+GeneralHysterics> Crouching moron, hidden badass
[0:51:55] <+Comradeiota> Hell yes
[0:51:56] <+AsinPersuasion> @olaksi oh god you ruined it for me
[0:51:56] <Halospaz117> HELL YEAH
[0:51:57] <astrofalcon1> yes
[0:51:58] <arkv01> atton has our erection
[0:51:58] <DocMadfox> Upgrade!
[0:51:59] <Graywolf_the_45th> He's Aarth
[0:52:00] <subjectg> @zenith0111 canderous in the first game mentions that the sith goaded them into fighting, so in a sense it was a proxy war
[0:52:00] <pan_nochal> so much better than Carth, holy shit
[0:52:01] <+memequisition> yeyeyeyeye
[0:52:03] <Retinolgaming> PogChamp Upgrade
[0:52:09] <+Comradeiota> You're fooled into thinking he's in the carth chart
[0:52:10] <usurper_sos> big woolieFABRICATION
[0:52:10] <+zetrexx> FINALYL WE'RE PAST BARTH PogChamp
[0:52:12] <+Comradeiota> and then this convo
[0:52:14] <Halospaz117> Doing wrong VERY COOLY
[0:52:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> BARTH IS DEAD! Long Live Atton!
[0:52:16] <tolloponik> and my erection
[0:52:24] <Jaku2011> No longer Barth
[0:52:29] <+mankeyfigh> Erect
[0:52:30] <GarbageNirvana> Lightsaber noises are the MKULTRA activation codes
[0:52:32] <atema128> Heck yeah, Atton earned his name!
[0:52:35] <+AsinPersuasion> no carths in obsidian games
[0:52:38] <RedAhoge> anyone else thought he was a MIA Jedi trainee?
[0:52:39] <+AsinPersuasion> only aatons
[0:52:47] <heartlesshealer> "Barth died a long time ago. My name is Atton now"
[0:52:48] <subjectg> this is why i’m always disappointed about atton being on the carth chart
[0:53:01] <Bruno_Tropical> I WAS A THE PUNISHER ALL ALONG
[0:53:01] <+AsinPersuasion> @RedAhoge theres a character exclusive to the female exile like that
[0:53:03] <DocMadfox> Fun fact: the demons can hear the Fourth Wall music
[0:53:04] <olaksi> He just seems like the usual boring Bioware male sidekick, then this shit kicks off
[0:53:05] <+Kitafin> too cool to be a side character
[0:53:06] <zenith0111> @subjectg Goading only works if they have an internet displeasure with one another. It's just revealing what's there
[0:53:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Want proof that only the Jedi matter Woolie? You ever play Rogue Squadron or Battlefront? Kappa
[0:53:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @subjectg Yeah I was too but its worth it for this
[0:53:13] <Overloard> moved on from barth to VARTH
[0:53:20] <+krispen_wa> BIG STRONG JEDI
[0:53:30] <RedAhoge> Big number good
[0:53:31] <+Deadpal> like *HK* droids.
[0:53:33] <subjectg> oh yeah, woolie’s popoff is worth it
[0:53:34] <+krispen_wa> SS Squads
[0:53:36] <GarbageNirvana> Alright we're gonna get you ready for these Jedi, listen up: Longing, rusted, furnace, daybreak, seventeen, benign, nine, homecoming, one, freight car.
[0:53:37] <lotharrio> A big part of KotOR1 was getting Bastilla and keeping her on your side.
[0:53:40] <astrofalcon1> LUL
[0:53:44] <+taggerung403> doing refugee tai chi
[0:53:50] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:53:50] <usurper_sos> those npcs are vibing
[0:53:51] <%gatorafan> THEY LOVE IT
[0:53:52] <zenith0111> "Oh those damn Jedi right?" "Right?! Fuck em"
[0:53:52] <+AsinPersuasion> thats why you do this scene on the ship
[0:53:55] <+GeneralHysterics> From MYYY
[0:53:55] <startstoprepeat> ha, they keep saying "revan" so they don't have to record lines for "he" and "she"
[0:53:57] <subjectg> SithSchtaffel
[0:53:58] <Redblood801> FROM MY
[0:54:06] <astrofalcon1> i still can not believe this
[0:54:12] <%siamzero94> *Staffel
[0:54:14] <hard_bop_sax_solo> "saber swingers" sounds like a slur
[0:54:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @startstoprepeat they do

[0:54:42] <startstoprepeat> yup
[0:54:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @hard_bop_sax_solo you think that's bad? People in my Star Wars RP called them Force Ch*ckers
[0:54:54] <hard_bop_sax_solo> LOL
[0:54:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:55:00] <zenith0111> I hate these replies
[0:55:01] <TDAWS_MP132> 2 works too
[0:55:06] <+jiggy_snipe> 2 is b etter lol
[0:55:11] <heartlesshealer> these both suck, but 2 is better
[0:55:15] <+GeneralHysterics> called out
[0:55:19] <astrofalcon1> LUL
[0:55:26] <lotharrio> War criminal Fann Y'Pak!
[0:55:36] <astrofalcon1> I'm anakin but you're vader
[0:55:37] <+pectusumbra> damn indeed
[0:55:41] <+logoth_> Mooka shaka paka
[0:55:45] <subjectg> This might be a plothole actually, since the Exile wasn’t in the Jedi Civil War, no?
[0:55:48] <+krispen_wa> Here we go
[0:55:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> THE LUST BACKFIRED
[0:55:55] <%siamzero94> Ok time for big FORCE
[0:55:57] <RedAhoge> Atton was part of the sith?
[0:55:57] <usurper_sos> Really, just a girl?
[0:56:00] <subjectg> So why’s Atton saying we killed Jedi?
[0:56:09] <+krispen_wa> FemPC makes a lot more sense after this conversation
[0:56:10] <+AsinPersuasion> malachor 5
[0:56:15] <+AsinPersuasion> nuked a bunch of jedi too
[0:56:19] <%siamzero94> @subjectg Malachor 5
[0:56:26] <RedAhoge> "Sparda woke up to dat ass"
[0:56:27] <Maleicus> and she was hot
[0:56:29] <arkv01> tinder be like "hey stop being a sith and come over to my place"
[0:56:32] <subjectg> unless of course, he’s talking about malachor, but that’s a bit of a stretch
[0:56:33] <astrofalcon1> but she was hot tho
[0:56:34] <zenith0111> "Jedi just started hitting on me"
[0:56:40] <jorniev> atto woke up to the ASS
[0:56:42] <zenith0111> "She was hot so I listened"
[0:56:44] <usurper_sos> He woke up to ASS
[0:56:45] <Kirlrik> we call it recycling cmon now
[0:56:45] <+zetrexx> hehehehehe here we go
[0:56:45] <+MidnightBurst12> malachor 5 was fucked
[0:56:52] <SinnerBeta> there's a lot of "love" in kotor 2, but it's the melodramatic tragic type, falling in love with someone you shouldn't and watching from afar or trying to kill them
[0:56:53] <+libra_zero> Just like the Inquisitorius
[0:56:54] <+PerfectDare> Break them... With the force... nnnggg, you have it inside you.
[0:56:58] <%siamzero94> @subjectg the exile gave the order
[0:57:02] <arkv01> hes force sensitive?
[0:57:05] <Djinnazz> : )
[0:57:10] <+mankeyfigh> Like Bastila
[0:57:15] <lotharrio> @arkv01 He's GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS
[0:57:19] <Ids560> look sometimes you gotta just train super-assassins to fill your Pocketsssss
[0:57:19] <heartlesshealer> =)
[0:57:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nothing breaks moral like missing squadmates
[0:57:24] <Bruno_Tropical> Everone can use to Force actually
[0:57:32] <+GeneralHysterics> latent force being an excuse for good luck or uncanny ability is one of my FAVORITES
[0:57:32] <DocMadfox> Production lines!
[0:57:34] <astrofalcon1> maybe don't worry about it
[0:57:35] <hard_bop_sax_solo> Sithdustrial complex
[0:57:36] <+SolidusRex> Woolie gets it
[0:57:36] <+wunp_fxs> LUL pretty much
[0:57:37] <+Superspider51> Revan pretty much did
[0:57:41] <pan_nochal> wasn't that meant to be the Star Forge
[0:57:41] <trickquestionz> Basically yes
[0:57:41] <indig0bird> Seized the Means of Sith production!
[0:57:41] <zenith0111> YE YE YE
[0:57:42] <+PerfectDare> yeah, that's about right
[0:57:42] <+zetrexx> yeah the star forge kicks ass
[0:57:42] <Bruno_Tropical> Everyone can sense the force and use
[0:57:44] <CastellanVon> pretty much
[0:57:44] <heartlesshealer> Yup
[0:57:47] <subjectg> @siamzero94 i know how bad it was, but i did think that atton was implicating a more direct form of killing, which flows from his earlier “techniques” dialogue
[0:57:47] <+mankeyfigh> Yup
[0:57:48] <Redblood801> Insert the dark side anally for maximum results
[0:57:49] <SixthSun2> The Empire ended up having that, see: Jedi Fallen Order
[0:57:50] <alrobot2014> revan had that shit going efficient
[0:57:51] <Jaku2011> Yes
[0:57:52] <Major_monotone> Revan patented it
[0:57:52] <+taggerung403> no rule of 2 in those days
[0:57:54] <Gruhunchously> She brute force'd it
[0:57:54] <+libra_zero> Well, sometimes a corpse pops out instead, but yeah that's about what happened
[0:57:55] <+GeneralHysterics> Oh yeah, revan has a WAY bigger dick than sheev could ever hope to have
[0:57:56] <jorniev> A GRAY GUY
[0:58:02] <+GeneralHysterics> especially fem revan
[0:58:04] <randominternetsurfer> JEDI GOTH GIRL BIMBOFICATION
[0:58:05] <fangovafang> damn..
[0:58:06] <heartlesshealer> Creator
[0:58:08] <+Bear_Mane> Make Darth Talon Canon
[0:58:08] <atema128> Basically yeah
[0:58:08] <arkv01> the sith meat grinder
[0:58:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ultimately Id argue Sheev was more successful though
[0:58:10] <lotharrio> I don't Pockets was that sweet about it, @WoolieVersus
[0:58:10] <+zetrexx> revan has what sheev wants
[0:58:12] <AMWACloak> Fun Fact: this is how Exalted works with Abyssal Exalted. Stick good guy in box, simmer, produce bad guy.
[0:58:12] <RedAhoge> Revan is successful Disembodied head Dio
[0:58:17] <SoaringLettuce> Pockets was a fucking pro
[0:58:19] <hard_bop_sax_solo> Think Charlie Chaplin modern times gears
[0:58:22] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Thats what happened to Bastilla!
[0:58:26] <Kirlrik> truly a JRPG
[0:58:31] <ralphfromdk> The Emperor kinda did this too, but they just turned out to all be Inqusitors, not full Sith
[0:58:35] <+mankeyfigh> Yup yup yup
[0:58:37] <%Mindtrick_Matt> She gets tortured in one scene and is suddenly dark
[0:58:39] <+Deadpal> yeah, cause revan had that super machine
[0:58:41] <+krispen_wa> Sheev probably could create an army of evil dudes, but that would violate the idea of the Rule of Two
[0:58:44] <allenatterax> Battle Realms unit training
[0:58:45] <%JohnAtDawn> @AMWACloak And then they steal their soul back and create a Solar Exalt without the great curse.
[0:58:48] <trickquestionz> Nah Revan just runs torture camps run by death squads

[1:02:06] <RedAhoge> Hard Kight
[1:02:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It's almost like you remembered the empathy that made you fight to protect the Republic in the first place
[1:02:07] <lotharrio> They repeatedly say, "A Jedi's life is sacrifice."
[1:02:08] <+AsinPersuasion> its what it means to be an exile style jedi
[1:02:08] <+krispen_wa> FemPC makes a lot more sense but you don't get to bang biggy titty goth gf so it's hard to decide
[1:02:08] <RedAhoge> light

[1:02:17] <+Deadpal> yeah
[1:02:18] <+GeneralHysterics> "I'm just curious to see where it goes" says the man guiding woolie's hips
[1:02:18] <+zetrexx> no im not tired of it this rules
[1:02:20] <+Deadpal> it's the evil side.
[1:02:22] <arkv01> this npc just BACKED UP to eavesdrop some mo
[1:02:26] <Djinnazz> Can you move sir?
[1:02:28] <bigmacjack12> No yeah, thats what it means to be a Jedi lol
[1:02:30] <TheMostAverageGamer4> is pockcts going bad or good?
[1:02:31] <Halospaz117> I think it's more referring to the IDEAL jedi rather than how they are
[1:02:32] <+taggerung403> jedi are allowed to feel compassion sir
[1:02:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> "but"
[1:02:39] <+jiggy_snipe> the dark side is boring because it's just dumb evil
[1:02:39] <cowcow6> it IS funny though
[1:02:41] <%siamzero94> it's self-destructing, so yeah it's bad
[1:02:44] <%Irridium> if you gotta mentally break someone to see your side it might not be that good LUL
[1:02:44] <+lag2993> to be fair the bad side is personal while the good side is utilitarian which is very dumb as your two binaries
[1:02:46] <+BionoidLCR> @Djinnazz its like when the news channel is live on the street and fuckers see the camera LUL
[1:02:46] <%gatorafan> BUT!
[1:02:51] <trickquestionz> "Woolie hates love."
[1:02:51] <+AsinPersuasion> kotor 2 only makes sense if you play it as a person trying to redefine jedi
[1:03:00] <Akett> It's also what Anikin said in episode 2.
[1:03:04] <RedAhoge> Jedi are not allowed carnal shit
[1:03:05] <jorniev> WHAT IS LOVE
[1:03:11] <OldManDeckardCain> jedis are just a bunch of weird celibate monks wiht super powers
[1:03:11] <cowcow6> man on the channel theres gonna be a whole episode of talking to atton LMAO
[1:03:13] <rubbishbinge> love is just chemicals after all
[1:03:17] <+taggerung403> DIO would make a sick Sith lord
[1:03:23] <subjectg> Just remember how Luke in the original trilogy is how a jedi is supposed to be ideally, contrast to yoda and obiwan as the oldtype jedi
[1:03:26] <RevolverBobkat> The Crab Cycle, but Sith
[1:03:30] <+dezimaly> this convo is going to be its own episode
[1:03:30] <+AsinPersuasion> pats been fucking waiting for that episode too lol
[1:03:33] <indig0bird> It's easy to dunk on an 8 years old but critisism of Jedi is so much more interesting
[1:03:44] <RedAhoge> Just gotta find Devil arm Sith
[1:03:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> There is no such thing as a Grey Jedi, because all Jedi are "grey"
[1:03:58] <subjectg> and yeah, ultimately kotor 2 is looking to rebuild the jedi
[1:04:02] <jorniev> what do you call that thing that makes you help others in need without anything in return?

[1:07:47] <+AsinPersuasion> the power is cool tho
[1:07:54] <lotharrio> Jesus arrives, wearing a black robe and a katana.
[1:07:55] <+Superspider51> @olaksi the game goes out of it's way to make you look like an asshole for going lol-evil and that's one of the best parts of the games plot
[1:07:56] <Bruno_Tropical> Grandpa has no fucks
[1:07:59] <+lag2993> grandpa had a drank a bit too much
[1:08:02] <Maleicus> and he's back

[1:08:28] <subjectg> That’s dark side juice for ya
[1:08:33] <%jinking79> I'm hearing nothing bad about the Grey Jedis
[1:08:36] <Jaku2011> Grandpa: Am I interrupting your character development?
[1:09:01] <trickquestionz> Option 3 straight up turns him into an empty shell
[1:09:02] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:09:07] <%siamzero94> He was manipulated to hate jedi and suddenly one of them showed him the truth about himself. Pretty darn confusing
[1:09:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> "I welcome your help" is say "I agree to give you the chance to redeem yourself"
[1:09:21] <+taggerung403> She sacrificed herself to him
[1:09:40] <Graywolf_the_45th> Kreia herserlf calls him murderer
[1:09:41] <+GeneralHysterics> capital M Murderer
[1:09:44] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> WAR CRIMES
[1:09:45] <Kirlrik> high score
[1:09:47] <+lag2993> wow are you saying all jedi look alike
[1:09:49] <+dezimaly> Atton cause some wipeouts
[1:09:50] <+Proxzo> Big Murder
[1:09:51] <atema128> He got shown a mirror of himself and it broke him.
[1:09:52] <%mccf> he's got some wipeouts
[1:09:53] <Bruno_Tropical> Vader was redeemed tho
[1:09:54] <lotharrio> You can argue almost anything else as orders or duty or war. But Atton murdered that woman.
[1:09:56] <zenith0111> "You didn't kill them you're just guilty..." -Woolie
[1:09:57] <+jiggy_snipe> this is a common thing in fiction when you're enemy is portrayed as inhuman or really evil and you meet one who isn't so it messes a person up
[1:09:58] <trickquestionz> Big capital G space gestappo
[1:10:00] <asurite_warrior> noooo 2
[1:10:08] <olaksi> 2 seems reasonable too
[1:10:15] <arkv01> eat the jedi
[1:10:16] <+GeneralHysterics> "So like...how'd you torture her?"
[1:10:21] <Damie904> 2 sounds like leave the party
[1:10:22] <+mankeyfigh> I’d go for 1
[1:10:25] <Damie904> So I wouldnt pick it
[1:10:25] <asurite_warrior> follow your heart woolie
[1:10:25] <+GeneralHysterics> "Cut some toes off?
[1:10:26] <+Flambage> many many war crimes
[1:10:29] <jorniev> DO YOU REALLY!?
[1:10:30] <asurite_warrior> NO 2
[1:10:35] <+krispen_wa> 2
[1:10:35] <heartlesshealer> 1 for the route
[1:10:35] <+taggerung403> Fann is a good guy
[1:10:37] <CookieDoughFK> 2
[1:10:38] <+Superspider51> he won't leave the party
[1:10:40] <+SolidusRex> 1
[1:10:40] <heartlesshealer> maybe
[1:10:40] <bigmacjack12> 1
[1:10:45] <+logoth_> 1
[1:10:46] <Jaku2011> Atton the type to torture dance
[1:10:49] <+AsinPersuasion> fann is a really half assed good guy tho
[1:10:49] <SinnerBeta> they met, and as he was killing her she mind fucked him, and it was over in a few seconds
[1:10:53] <Bruno_Tropical> if Vader was redeemed surely Atton too?
[1:10:53] <asurite_warrior> He stays with 2
[1:10:59] <lotharrio> Don't throw away her sacrifice.
[1:11:03] <+lag2993> is it sinister or confusing
[1:11:03] <%siamzero94> he's required for the endgame, he won't leave
[1:11:03] <MasterDecoder> I think you can ask him a bit more about it later? Maybe?
[1:11:05] <+krispen_wa> 2 isn't sinister
[1:11:09] <CookieDoughFK> How is that worse then killing Children?
[1:11:11] <%Irridium> Well, think of it like this. He wants to at least try even if it doesn't work out so, hey
[1:11:11] <+Superspider51> 2 is neutral as fuck
[1:11:12] <Ifrit_13> the Dark side is a hell of a drug
[1:11:12] <arkv01> it feels like we're being the same manipulative jedi assholes with option 1
[1:11:14] <+lag2993> cause this all happened in one event
[1:11:15] <usurper_sos> He won't leave with 2
[1:11:17] <Gruhunchously> He killed her because she made him feel things that made him uncomfortable.
[1:11:23] <DocMadfox> You're overthinking it
[1:11:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie's desire to punish is, blinding him to concept that 1 is saying "I'll give you the chance", not "I forgive you unconditionally"
[1:11:25] <trickquestionz> big rapey undertones
[1:11:26] <lotharrio> "Homicidal ass-" A Sith you mean?
[1:11:26] <asurite_warrior> 1 feels manipulative, 2 feels real
[1:11:28] <+mankeyfigh> He won’t leave at all
[1:11:29] <+Bear_Mane> pick number 3 mylord
[1:11:34] <+AsinPersuasion> i mean you are manipulating him
[1:11:36] <%eanscrale> Hey, at least he's not Carth.
[1:11:36] <+jiggy_snipe> it was my job so w/e
[1:11:38] <+AsinPersuasion> with his consent in this case
[1:11:39] <Gruhunchously> You can pick 2
[1:11:42] <+itrobthebot> Did for the rock
[1:11:47] <+Superspider51> 2 is you being the most honest with him and that's what he really needs
[1:11:49] <mihokspawn> I wanted to kill her because I loved her. <=> Mercy kill?
[1:11:50] <jorniev> ATTON ...did your dick get hard?
[1:11:51] <%Irridium> 1 is not absolving him of everyhing, it's just giving him the chance to try
[1:11:52] <+krispen_wa> 2 makes you seem more than just Space Jesus
[1:11:52] <+AsinPersuasion> manipulation doesn't have to be negative
[1:11:53] <GarbageNirvana> Looks like it's time for Jack...to LET ER RIP
[1:11:53] <Jaku2011> Maybe just pick the dialogue you want here Woolz
[1:11:53] <subjectg> 1 just feels compassionate
[1:11:58] <Goodvibes99508> ok wait, the options are kill her or she goes to the torture factory around the clock
[1:12:00] <Bruno_Tropical> what a fetish
[1:12:12] <lotharrio> Her death restored his humanity.
[1:12:14] <+mankeyfigh> I’m pretty forgiving honestly
[1:12:16] <asurite_warrior> It was also kill or torture room
[1:12:24] <+AsinPersuasion> @Goodvibes99508 the first option also leads to atton getting shipped off to the torture factory
[1:12:30] <+lag2993> npc : " so you gonna forgive him or what?"
[1:12:34] <+Zyquux> Corrupt him!
[1:12:35] <cowcow6> YO REALLY
[1:12:39] <Damie904> Don't forget, if he didnt kill her, it was torture room and brainwashing.
[1:12:41] <heartlesshealer> seeing the dark party roll is always fun
[1:12:41] <trickquestionz> They all get monster mash faces
[1:12:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 2 is the choice of "we can't be friends, but we can still work together"
[1:12:48] <+GeneralHysterics> he was turned into that monster because of his sense of duty and loyalty to Revan. By the time the jedi opened his eyes to what he'd become he felt like he was in too deep and couldn't escape it. So he killed her. But those feelings didn't go away and festered until he couldn't bear it anymore and he left.
[1:12:51] <Halospaz117> I think parts of his hair also starts graying
[1:12:53] <subjectg> People comment on your fucked up face too!
[1:12:54] <+AsinPersuasion> the idea is that she knew that and let him kill her anyway
[1:13:01] <asurite_warrior> Please 2
[1:13:06] <+krispen_wa> COWARD
[1:13:12] <trickquestionz> "You fucked up my face." -Atton
[1:13:15] <asurite_warrior> Manipulator
[1:13:19] <%bread_assassin> @Damie904 You're right, but I don't think that's why he did it.
[1:13:19] <heartlesshealer> probably 3
[1:13:21] <GarbageNirvana> something something kill the past
[1:13:36] <+krispen_wa> 1 is good
[1:13:37] <+Zyquux> Light side Exile with corrupted companions would have been fun
[1:13:44] <+AsinPersuasion> 3 be attons friend
[1:13:54] <asurite_warrior> last one was the big one this one doesnt matter as much

[1:16:59] <+balouie> visas
[1:16:59] <+mankeyfigh> And now Atton’s your Padawan
[1:17:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The entire theme of this game is to break the conventions of Force-User structure
[1:17:08] <%Pillagius> I want to see Aton explode with power Dragon Ballz style!!!
[1:17:11] <Bruno_Tropical> Jedi Fallen Order vibes
[1:17:14] <arkv01> beCOmE a JEdi foR dumMIEs
[1:17:15] <asurite_warrior> FORCE USER
[1:17:16] <Halospaz117> You're your own jedi
[1:17:16] <+Superspider51> the stats don't lie Woolie
[1:17:17] <usurper_sos> Just look at the script
[1:17:18] <Amardeux> LUL
[1:17:21] <heartlesshealer> MYSTIC ATTON
[1:17:23] <Zebroneath> My character sheet CLEARLY SAYS it has force points.
[1:17:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoAscend JEDIIIII
[1:17:25] <jorniev> the S in STAR WARS , stands for force bondS
[1:17:28] <Razeino> Mass Murder more like special ops
[1:17:30] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean I know more than you so sure I guess?
[1:17:31] <+mankeyfigh> This is as ridiculous as when Anakin got Ahsoka as HIS PADAWAN
[1:17:31] <%xcompleasedad> ALL HAIL THE SCRIPT- Goerge Lucas
[1:17:33] <+balouie> Visas might be the best example and she is a sith
[1:17:33] <+AsinPersuasion> you're a new kind of jedi
[1:17:36] <+mankeyfigh> IT WAS STUPID
[1:17:37] <+GeneralHysterics> @jorniev pls no
[1:17:38] <SinnerBeta> AWEKEN, MY STUDENTS!
[1:17:40] <+Superspider51> LEVEL HIM THE FUCK UP
[1:17:47] <DocMadfox> John suddenly cares
[1:17:52] <asurite_warrior> Anyone can be a jedi it always felt like they started young in the order so they could indoctrinate them.
[1:17:53] <+PaladinDupre> RISE
[1:17:55] <prince_johnny_> Wow
[1:17:57] <Halospaz117> God how long was that conversation?
[1:17:58] <mitochondriahousepower> INFLUENCER
[1:18:00] <+AsinPersuasion> wait how far are they from bao-dur training?
[1:18:00] <%siamzero94> Red & Blue: What the fuck just happened?!?
[1:18:00] <+lag2993> new jedi and the npc gives no shiz
[1:18:05] <+zetrexx> lmfao
[1:18:07] <Gruhunchously> Funny that
[1:18:07] <usurper_sos> High level influencer
[1:18:08] <+SolidusRex> He has no idea
[1:18:09] <Graywolf_the_45th> hmmmmmm
[1:18:09] <ZeeJiggle> Yep
[1:18:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Rise, Knight of the Republic
[1:18:10] <olaksi> Nope, super force sensitive
[1:18:11] <+AsinPersuasion> well woolie took half hour breaks between each dialogue choice kek
[1:18:11] <Make_me_mad> V trying to keep a straight face super hard right now
[1:18:12] <+taggerung403> His force has been awaken
[1:18:12] <+GeneralHysterics> waiting for the turn where she can become a jedi, too
[1:18:14] <DocMadfox> HMMMMMM. We dismissed it with Handmaiden did we?
[1:18:14] <+MidnightBurst12> ...
[1:18:14] <ralphfromdk> Man... Gun Jedi... full John Wick :o
[1:18:18] <a_mad_dragon> dash rendar did it
[1:18:20] <jorniev> the true power of an influencer
[1:18:21] <+MidnightBurst12> no
[1:18:22] <CrabSlacks> nah it's easy
[1:18:22] <+jiggy_snipe> no
[1:18:22] <arkv01> I mean luke
[1:18:22] <+GeneralHysterics> That's jedi propaganda
[1:18:24] <+Bear_Mane> REY can do it tho
[1:18:24] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Is it though?
[1:18:26] <+jiggy_snipe> Luke
[1:18:26] <+Zyquux> PepeLaugh He lacks critical information
[1:18:27] <+Deadpal> that's just bullshit for the prequels.
[1:18:28] <%alpharius88> nah
[1:18:29] <trickquestionz> Yes, but you don't have to be a Jedi
[1:18:30] <%Pillagius> Luke learned, didn't he?
[1:18:30] <+PaladinDupre> that rule only exists so Anakin can kill children
[1:18:30] <lotharrio> That's total bullshit based on them indoctrinating kids.
[1:18:31] <+MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> He lacks the critical information
[1:18:31] <+AsinPersuasion> luke and rey?
[1:18:31] <+SolidusRex> Jedi propaganda
[1:18:32] <prince_johnny_> Luke
[1:18:33] <Graywolf_the_45th> it's much harder to brainwash an adult
[1:18:33] <subjectg> Is it?
[1:18:33] <Gruhunchously> He's not *really* a Jedi, just a Force user
[1:18:35] <Bruno_Tropical> nah, its just for nrainwashing
[1:18:35] <heartlesshealer> The age thing is HARD PROPAGANDA
[1:18:36] <jorniev> being a jedi is super easy
[1:18:36] <+taggerung403> No, its just easier for children to buy into the jedi philosphy
[1:18:37] <CrabSlacks> jedi just want to brainwash kids
[1:18:38] <+AsinPersuasion> and leia
[1:18:39] <+GeneralHysterics> which is ironic since he's like 900
[1:18:39] <+jiggy_snipe> also technically Leia too
[1:18:40] <+MidnightBurst12> the jedi just have that as a rule
[1:18:42] <DocMadfox> It's hard to indoctrinate you as an adult
[1:18:42] <+AsinPersuasion> leia was even older than luke
[1:18:43] <jorniev> EASY BREZY
[1:18:43] <+mankeyfigh> PULL HIS JEDI TRIGGER
[1:18:45] <Halospaz117> I think it's harder to drill in the jedi doctrine as an adult. You are not drilling in the doctrine
[1:18:46] <+Superspider51> the "we don't train adults" line is because by then the people would have already made bonds
[1:18:46] <Kivros> that's because of emotions
[1:18:46] <+Bear_Mane> brainwash them
[1:18:51] <usurper_sos> It's easy to indoctrinate children
[1:18:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the age thing is because older people are more likely of falling to the dark
[1:18:52] <time_axis> its not that it's harder to learn as an adult, it's that they're harder to indoctrinate as an adult
[1:18:54] <ralphfromdk> It's mostly because kids are easier to "brainwash" them into space monks.
[1:18:55] <Bruno_Tropical> yeah, its for brainwashing
[1:18:56] <%siamzero94> the age thing is about their mind being closed off from learning new things, or read, brainwashing
[1:18:57] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Cant brainwash them if theyre not impressionable
[1:19:00] <lotharrio> Obi-Wan was Luke's age when he started to learn.
[1:19:02] <heartlesshealer> literal churchy brainwashing
[1:19:08] <startstoprepeat> it makes sense to indoctrinate them when they're young
[1:19:08] <zenith0111> RELIGIOUS CHILD SOLDIERS
[1:19:09] <arkv01> orphans confirmed the superior class of children
[1:19:10] <%Pillagius> @DocMadfox bingo! ohnYes
[1:19:12] <+jiggy_snipe> this is just brainwashing
[1:19:15] <+zetrexx> like learning a second language
[1:19:19] <Major_monotone> More and more like a religious cult
[1:19:19] <+MidnightBurst12> gotta train those child soldiers for the force
[1:19:25] <%Irridium> muh fambly
[1:19:27] <zenith0111> My family....
[1:19:29] <+Zyquux> "fucking bonds" Good word choice
[1:19:32] <ZeeJiggle> family..
[1:19:34] <+taggerung403> A lot of lukes new jedi order had adults in the EU
[1:19:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> You recruited KYP DURRON
[1:19:37] <GarbageNirvana> You ever get the sense that all the EU writers are way smarter than any of the film writers ever were
[1:19:38] <Halospaz117> No M'family, only M'Fann
[1:19:44] <zekana> ya ive kind of known for years that jedi is just a religous cult. just a few steps away from drinking the koolaid man
[1:19:45] <+mankeyfigh> My fambily...
[1:19:52] <+taggerung403> Corran Horn was the absolute shit
[1:19:57] <%siamzero94> Though considering how easy it seems to be to fall to the dark side, yeah, they better be brainwashed to remain jedis
[1:19:58] <arkv01> not anymore, he has to give up on anime tiddy now
[1:19:59] <olaksi> Has family: huge liability. Has murdered people: welcome to the order!
[1:20:02] <heartlesshealer> Now level up your new Mystic Atton and enjoy!
[1:20:02] <jorniev> the S In bondS stands for STRAND
[1:20:04] <lotharrio> Think of it like this, Atton's got his character sheet full up on scoundrel levels, so he'll probably never hit the same Jedi heights as Fann.
[1:20:05] <+SolidusRex> I wonder how long it'll take Woolie to guess why he isn't leveling Handmaiden and Bao Dur
[1:20:25] <+mankeyfigh> Oh my god
[1:20:26] <+AsinPersuasion> its everyone but bao-dur i believe
[1:20:26] <%Pillagius> Oh, right! you totally can do that!
[1:20:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @taggerung403 he was cool, I preferred Face and Piggy
[1:20:34] <subjectg> I think it’s far easier to parse kotor 2’s story if you separate the term jedi from the actual jedi order
[1:20:36] <+mankeyfigh> Really?
[1:20:40] <+AsinPersuasion> yeah
[1:20:42] <+AsinPersuasion> its handy
[1:20:44] <lotharrio> @SolidusRex HM is so that the duels are easier.
[1:20:45] <%siamzero94> but only the ones he can't learn by himself, i believe
[1:20:46] <+mankeyfigh> Jedi army?
[1:21:00] <+GeneralHysterics> DON'T TEACH ATTON DOMINATE MIND. Given his backstory that is SUS as fuck
[1:21:03] <OldManDeckardCain> unless they're Rey LUL
[1:21:04] <+mankeyfigh> Personal Jedi crew?
[1:21:06] <+Starlight_Gamer> 12 levels for jedi sentinel?
[1:21:16] <+AsinPersuasion> theres no level cap in kotor 2
[1:21:20] <+AsinPersuasion> you usually end up around 30ish
[1:21:24] <Amardeux> LUL
[1:21:26] <Jaku2011> Took Rey a few minutes
[1:21:30] <%Pillagius> @Starlight_Gamer level cap doesn't exist here.
[1:21:35] <tolloponik> atton now knows hydro Pump
[1:21:36] <+Superspider51> level cap was 40 or 50 but it's a pain to actually reach it
[1:21:37] <asurite_warrior> I like making atton a blaster jedi
[1:21:38] <+Starlight_Gamer> thought it did
[1:21:39] <arkv01> edge that wartortle
[1:21:41] <subjectg> technically the level cap is 50, but that’s realistically impossible
[1:21:44] <%siamzero94> @AsinPersuasion Lvl cap is 50, but yeah, good luck getting there
[1:21:47] <ralphfromdk> Atton being "awakened" by a Force user fucking with his head is kinda what happened to Rey in The Force Awakens.
[1:21:50] <+mankeyfigh> Rey started using that Force FAST
[1:21:50] <mistersups> Not a Wartortle. But a Mudkip.
[1:21:51] <startstoprepeat> i mean, there are reasons your party members can be fast-tracked a little
[1:21:52] <Gruhunchously> RIP Sneak Attack
[1:21:59] <+liquidzr0> PokBlastoise
[1:22:10] <+jiggy_snipe> sneaky jedi
[1:22:18] <heartlesshealer> continue, as opposed to swerving
[1:22:20] <+AsinPersuasion> yeah thats why i don't store levels on atton
[1:22:21] <+zetrexx> stealth is very lore friendly
[1:22:25] <%Pillagius> @Starlight_Gamer well, realistically, you can get to level 34-35 tops, maaaaybe higher with some tricks but that's how much xp is floating in the game
[1:22:25] <subjectg> Gun Jedi is an underrated build
[1:22:26] <+AsinPersuasion> sneak attack is huuuuuuuuge in kotor2
[1:22:28] <+AsinPersuasion> so much damage
[1:22:43] <+SolidusRex> Those three are all you need
[1:22:48] <+Starlight_Gamer> hmmmm.... okay
[1:22:54] <subjectg> sneak attack is the shit, always
[1:23:07] <%siamzero94> so what's it gonna be? gun or sword
[1:23:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:23:10] <lotharrio> Probably want that Finesse feat.
[1:23:12] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Gun Jedi doe
[1:23:14] <BestTeaMaker> gun gun gun gun
[1:23:16] <+GeneralHysterics> I need more gun jedi stories in Star Wars
[1:23:20] <OldManDeckardCain> gun jedi build defeated grievous tbf Kappa
[1:23:24] <lotharrio> There's a better gun Jedi option.
[1:23:27] <+jiggy_snipe> yea gun jedi
[1:23:30] <+AsinPersuasion> gun kata
[1:23:32] <+taggerung403> double gun wielding jedi is sick
[1:23:33] <+GeneralHysterics> Honestly kinda tired of lightsabers.
[1:23:35] <Visorak6> Build him a gun that fires lightsabers
[1:23:43] <asurite_warrior> force deflect is really good on him
[1:23:47] <heartlesshealer> Hmm
[1:23:50] <CrabSlacks> rapid fire and duel wield
[1:23:50] <Halospaz117> @Visorak6 What about a lightsaber that swings guns?
[1:23:50] <+Bluemanzee> Build him a lightsaber that fires guns
[1:23:51] <+AsinPersuasion> meh mira's flat damage thing is okay at best
[1:23:52] <Dangerzone979> Kanan Jarus was a gun jedi
[1:23:55] <jorniev> ATTON WICK
[1:23:56] <%Pillagius> one issue though - he has only 2 levels of blaster mastery...
[1:24:06] <heartlesshealer> Is there a way to make him a gun jedi who can block blaster fire without a saber?
[1:24:15] <+AsinPersuasion> id say you HAVE to make mira a gun jedi but atton can do either
[1:24:16] <subjectg> Yes actually
[1:24:16] <Visorak6> what
[1:24:17] <arkv01> a blaster?
[1:24:17] <Amardeux> LUL
[1:24:17] <+SolidusRex> Ezra
[1:24:18] <+jiggy_snipe> huh
[1:24:19] <subjectg> Force deflection
[1:24:20] <+GeneralHysterics> fucking. stop
[1:24:23] <%siamzero94> WHAT?
[1:24:26] <+Superspider51> it's a shitty stun gun
[1:24:29] <%Mindtrick_Matt> If your gonna make him a gun jedi get close combat
[1:24:29] <+KENTASHIRO> That hurt me
[1:24:29] <+taggerung403> That was lame it only stunned
[1:24:31] <BlackOrchidKI> Gunblade Saber
[1:24:32] <KaiserMario> YOU MEAN... A GUNBLADE????
[1:24:32] <%Madbearv> it has a gun built into the hilt
[1:24:32] <anita_dickin> CERVWNTES
[1:24:32] <Gruhunchously> There's also a flying whirlwind saber
[1:24:33] <+zetrexx> god i love the gun saber
[1:24:35] <+Kitafin> rifle saber
[1:24:36] <%Madbearv> its not bad
[1:24:36] <zenith0111> Is that the same series with the Helicopter Lightsaber?
[1:24:37] <BlueMoonBlues> Gunblade lightsaber?
[1:24:37] <ZeeJiggle> That's not as cool as dual weilding a saber and a gun
[1:24:38] <tolloponik> oh rebels...
[1:24:40] <lotharrio> There were so many gun-swords in real life.
[1:24:43] <+SolidusRex> It's the main character of Rebel's lightsaber
[1:24:44] <+Qits> Dr,Aphra found it in the comics. It fires a short burst of a lightsaber blade.
[1:24:46] <+AsinPersuasion> @heartlesshealer theres a force power for it yeah
[1:24:49] <+lag2993> isnt there also an arabian gun sword
[1:24:50] <arkv01> weapon porn
[1:24:53] <+GeneralHysterics> gun swords are real just not the best
[1:24:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus There are LITERAL gunblades
[1:24:56] <Dangerzone979> It shoots short range pulse blasts guys, it's not a real gun
[1:24:56] <subjectg> are you thinking of the sword nambu?
[1:24:56] <+jiggy_snipe> gun swords lol
[1:24:58] <heartlesshealer> cool, when I get a chance to play this then that is exactly what I will do with Atton
[1:24:59] <olaksi> There were some european gunswords too - they sucked
[1:25:02] <+mankeyfigh> i forgot about that
[1:25:05] <heartlesshealer> <3
[1:25:06] <SinnerBeta> lightsabers for everyone, no jokes
[1:25:06] <+GeneralHysterics> bayonets technically make your gun into a spear, too. Much better
[1:25:11] <%Irridium> I just gave him lightsabers because fuck it
[1:25:12] <AMWACloak> A lightsaber is just a laser that stays still, all blasters shoot lightsabers.
[1:25:13] <Major_monotone> Rifle spear best design
[1:25:13] <+taggerung403> give him force speed and master rapid shot
[1:25:14] <+mankeyfigh> Bayonets?
[1:25:17] <bigmacjack12> Lightsaber
[1:25:20] <Razeino> Robots for guns
[1:25:20] <SoaringLettuce> there were tons of gunblades in history
[1:25:23] <+jiggy_snipe> bayonets are gunspears
[1:25:28] <%bread_assassin> T3 is more for skills than range.
[1:25:31] <+zetrexx> gunjediiii
[1:25:32] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Always need some range bois
[1:25:33] <+RICE02> i heard there was once a guy in asia called Squall who fought with a Gunsword
[1:25:33] <subjectg> because that nambu is the only one where the sword is perpendicular to the gun
[1:25:37] <+Bear_Mane> are there Axe sabers?
[1:25:41] <zenith0111> Next you'll tell me there's a Greatsword Lightsaber
[1:25:47] <olaksi> I mean on paper a gunsword probably looked like a super good idea in the early days
[1:25:55] <lotharrio> If he's gun, then give him that deflect power.
[1:25:59] <%Mindtrick_Matt> @zenith0111 Kylo's is pretty close
[1:26:00] <%siamzero94> Force deflect if he goes with gun
[1:26:02] <SoaringLettuce> theres a polish (?) rifle that you could take the barrel out and the barrel was a sword
[1:26:03] <+taggerung403> force deflect
[1:26:19] <zenith0111> @mindtrick_matt It didn't seem any bigger than Reys
[1:26:23] <Goodvibes99508> revive; he comes up then raises someone else
[1:26:24] <%Irridium> probably give him the deflecting ability with his hands
[1:26:49] <ralphfromdk> Throw lightsaber, but throw gun instead and have it shoot people from odd angles :o
[1:26:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Light Dragon Slayer
[1:26:51] <+GeneralHysterics> Greatsword as a weapon is used very differently than a saber or longsword. Against smaller weapons, great swords are actually so big you use them like spears.
[1:27:07] <Major_monotone> @jiggy_snipe Rancor Slayer?
[1:27:14] <+lag2993> lol force throw spinning gun with trigger locked
[1:27:30] <heartlesshealer> Full on Enzo?
[1:27:45] <+jiggy_snipe> @Major_monotone lol yea
[1:27:49] <heartlesshealer> or whatever his name turned into
[1:27:50] <olaksi> @lag2993 or just use the force to hold the gun mid air and never have to get out of cover
[1:27:56] <subjectg> there’s a bollywood gif that perfectly encapsulates force throwing a gun
[1:28:08] <%Mindtrick_Matt> @zenith0111 I think it's slightly bigger but you are right, but he two hands it and it has the crossguard so its pretty close.
[1:28:24] <+lag2993> @olaksi lol might as well have the guns just chase people down shooting at them
[1:28:35] <%emeraldskrull> woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[1:28:36] <+GeneralHysterics> real talk, why don't jedi use guns like the detachable gun things that are used in Gundam? Shown to be busted as fuck.
[1:29:07] <+AsinPersuasion> cause star wars is a technologically stagnant setting
[1:29:13] <olaksi> @lag2993 Why does anyone even fight in SW when battle drones are a thing, really
[1:29:14] <+Superspider51> the force
[1:29:16] <%siamzero94> the force
[1:29:17] <lotharrio> The first one lets you bounce lasers with your hands. The second one gives you a bonus to the check.
[1:29:23] <jorniev> use the force to predict where your enemiaes are gonna move before you shoot there
[1:29:25] <Ifrit_13> their family
[1:29:28] <Dangerzone979> @GeneralHysterics If Obi Wan is anything to go by it's because they're deemed "Ineligant" and "Barbaric"
[1:29:31] <time_axis> the icon just shows their hand doing it
[1:29:32] <DSD24> Oh man I missed KOTOR today
[1:29:33] <%Pillagius> Either Kylo Catch, or Vader Palk
[1:29:34] <CrabSlacks> their hands are very calloused
[1:29:40] <+SolidusRex> Vader did Force Deflect in Empire Strikes Back
[1:29:41] <+lag2993> @olaksi cause they have a personality and would feel sad if they are the only ones fighting
[1:29:43] <subjectg> they just deflect with their minds
[1:29:47] <+GeneralHysterics> Obi's a crusty boomer by that time goddamn
[1:29:48] <+Zyquux> Interestingly, the deflection bonus in Force Redirection still applies when you have a lightsaber
[1:29:50] <a_mad_dragon> yeah but darth vader had ROBOT HANDS
[1:30:02] <+Superspider51> it is implied to be force deflect
[1:30:11] <townzzzzz> robo hands
[1:30:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:30:12] <zenith0111> Consistency caleb51
[1:30:12] <Gruhunchously> Blaster proof robot hands?
[1:30:14] <%Pillagius> Well, Force is an energy, and blaster shots is an energy, maybe they just disperce energy with the force?
[1:30:14] <+Superspider51> as blasters tear through the robotics like Luke's in ROTJ
[1:30:23] <SoaringLettuce> he does it again in Rogue One
[1:30:25] <Visorak6> To be fair SFX have come a long way
[1:30:26] <zenith0111> So robots are laser proof??
[1:30:27] <+jiggy_snipe> I imagine with skin wouldn't work
[1:30:33] <+taggerung403> Hes a high tier sith lord
[1:30:36] <+AsinPersuasion> woolie you dont internalize much in the first place lol
[1:30:43] <%siamzero94> oh yeah a blaster shot did get through luke robot arm
[1:30:48] <startstoprepeat> WOODOO HIDE
[1:30:52] <jorniev> man luke shoud have grabed that lightsaber
[1:30:55] <zenith0111> Wait his suit is considered "armor"?
[1:30:57] <arkv01> wizards with magic swords
[1:30:58] <+Bear_Mane> Yoda sucks force lighting in attack of the clones also
[1:30:59] <heartlesshealer> so damn smug
[1:30:59] <olaksi> LUL
[1:31:00] <zenith0111> I never realised
[1:31:02] <Gruhunchously> Waxed with Woodoo hide
[1:31:05] <CrabSlacks> wizard gas
[1:31:08] <+MidnightBurst12> stackin those credits
[1:31:10] <arkv01> BIG sniff
[1:31:11] <+GeneralHysterics> o no
[1:31:12] <+Superspider51> yeah it's a life support suit covered in armor
[1:31:19] <lotharrio> Good thing your farts smell like wintergreen mint!
[1:31:20] <olaksi> shit go dark more, the PC is getting insufferable
[1:31:22] <mistersups> Fann 'My Farts smell like Blue' Y'Pak
[1:31:26] <SoaringLettuce> heh, luke chopped vaders hand off, not that strong
[1:31:32] <+bokutachi_san> I'm really glad Woolie is digging this game
[1:31:34] <DSD24> I hope Woolie gets a purple lightsaber
[1:31:46] <heartlesshealer> uh oh
[1:31:48] <Gruhunchously> HOT TAKE INCOMING
[1:31:50] <+mankeyfigh> How much longer do we have on the clock?
[1:31:50] <zenith0111> @superspider51 How rare is his armor? That would seem standard for like everyone in this universe
[1:31:51] <nikoloas_> oh boy
[1:31:53] <heartlesshealer> oh
[1:31:54] <+Superspider51> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
[1:31:54] <arkv01> revans OK, I guess
[1:31:55] <CrabSlacks> *gasp*
[1:31:56] <%xcompleasedad> OH FUCK
[1:31:57] <+krispen_wa> OOOOOOH
[1:31:58] <asurite_warrior> #yeah
[1:31:59] <+MidnightBurst12> facts
[1:31:59] <FirewallStorm> true
[1:32:00] <Halospaz117> Exile is better
[1:32:00] <TDAWS_MP132> FACTS
[1:32:01] <+GeneralHysterics> damn
[1:32:01] <+KENTASHIRO> The things that make Revan interesting are all in KOTOR 2
[1:32:01] <+jiggy_snipe> Im so mad right now
[1:32:01] <%yendoria> Correct
[1:32:02] <starwars90001> Yes
[1:32:02] <+krispen_wa> but tru tho
[1:32:02] <Gruhunchously> I mean...
[1:32:03] <+wunp_fxs> daaaamn
[1:32:03] <+AsinPersuasion> oh he meant like that
[1:32:03] <oyyzzo> dun dun duuuuun
[1:32:03] <nikoloas_> not wrong
[1:32:04] <%Irridium> spittin' FACTS
[1:32:04] <+Bluemanzee> Playthrough RUINED
[1:32:04] <+Superspider51> THAT IS FALSE
[1:32:04] <+AsinPersuasion> yeah sure
[1:32:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> agreed. Revin is a bit mary sue ish
[1:32:05] <Gruhunchously> Yeah
[1:32:05] <Graywolf_the_45th> oooooo boy
[1:32:06] <+zetrexx> fuck you the revan in my head is the fucking best
[1:32:06] <usurper_sos> Not even wrong
[1:32:07] <arkv01> I mean I wouldn't suck revans dick or anything
[1:32:07] <JaceIsEpic> tru facts
[1:32:07] <redlanternreviews> Correct
[1:32:10] <+vaporousTippler> He's right, but I'm still mad.
[1:32:10] <startstoprepeat> this game retroactively makes revan way more interesting
[1:32:11] <lotharrio> Revan only gets interesting in this game.
[1:32:12] <ZeeJiggle> Maybe but Revan looks the coolest.
[1:32:12] <+GeneralHysterics> truth hurts. But you're super right
[1:32:12] <olaksi> Revan is barely a character
[1:32:13] <%xcompleasedad> Exile>>>>>Revan
[1:32:13] <+jiggy_snipe> im seething with anger with this take
[1:32:13] <%bread_assassin> I don't disagree.
[1:32:13] <+Zyquux> Not wrong
[1:32:13] <a_mad_dragon> ssjYEAH
[1:32:13] <+Bear_Mane> REVAN THo
[1:32:14] <Ids560> I mean Revan's more interesting in this game than revan in 1
[1:32:14] <+lag2993> but thats cause obsidian is a far more interesting developer than bioware
[1:32:14] <subjectg> As long as we retcon SWTOR
[1:32:15] <Razeino> True
[1:32:16] <Sarl109> it's the old Bioware vs Obsidian, BioWare has never been the good RPG Writers
[1:32:16] <%siamzero94> oh jeez, but yeah, exile is so much more interesting
[1:32:19] <Maleicus> yeah true
[1:32:19] <LordGoodrick> KOTOR 2 makes him more interesting
[1:32:20] <+krispen_wa> I like Exile waaaay more than Revan tbh
[1:32:21] <Djinnazz> BLASPHEMY
[1:32:21] <%CEGold> It's true and he should say it
[1:32:22] <zenith0111> Oh wow cool down that hot take Kappa
[1:32:25] <+AsinPersuasion> exile is WAY cooler
[1:32:27] <heartlesshealer> Interesting, yes. Cool...? *wiggly hand of doubt*
[1:32:28] <%Irridium> this game works overtime to make Revan interesting/cool
[1:32:28] <+zetrexx> revans incredibly cool bc of this game specifically
[1:32:30] <Gruhunchously> This game retcons him into being more interesting .
[1:32:31] <custoadian> Revan became more interesting because of kotor 2's additions to their backstor
[1:32:31] <TDAWS_MP132> EXILE
[1:32:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kreia>Exile>Revin
[1:32:34] <time_axis> most of Revan's characterization comes from this game anyway
[1:32:36] <+taggerung403> Exile was allowed to have a better story than Revan
[1:32:37] <+balouie> kreia is one of my favorite video game characters period
[1:32:38] <subjectg> and yeah, Revan is made better BECAUSE of this game
[1:32:39] <arkv01> MASH MASH MASH
[1:32:41] <xthomaswellertonx> Super Hot
[1:32:41] <liljojofett> I blame Bioware
[1:32:41] <mihokspawn> Revan is GOOD, all the characters here are BETTER]
[1:32:42] <nikoloas_> malak is so fucking lame
[1:32:42] <%Quiet__Viking> characters in this gane are hetter than any other character in starwars
[1:32:45] <CrabSlacks> all the characters are the cooler version of the last games
[1:32:46] <SoaringLettuce> a lot of revans coolness is in your head rather than the text
[1:32:48] <+AsinPersuasion> if only they read the chat
[1:32:49] <+Zyquux> The universal truth is that Carth is the least interesting character in both games
[1:32:50] <%alpharius88> juhani top tier tho....
[1:32:51] <+GeneralHysterics> Revan is the cornerstone of this era so OF COURSE they get the spotlight
[1:32:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I prefer Darth Revan to Sion and Nihilus though
[1:32:53] <lotharrio> Little V, the entire chat is agreeing with you.
[1:32:54] <Goodvibes99508> he is a self insert character
[1:32:55] <+lag2993> tbf all the characters in 2 play off what revan did so without him/her they wouldnt be as interesting
[1:32:56] <+AsinPersuasion> to see that it mostly agrees kek
[1:32:56] <asurite_warrior> Revan is a face though
[1:32:56] <Oak_bogle> I mean. Where’s the lie lol
[1:32:57] <+Superspider51> @zenith0111 it's not rare, it's actually somewhat cheap and was made on a budget. Vader just has a lightsaber and the force
[1:32:57] <jorniev> the exile is pretty fuking cool
[1:33:00] <%siamzero94> ok malak is pretty darn low on the tier list, compared to the triumvirate
[1:33:01] <ralphfromdk> Coolest thing about Revan is the helmet. It's so sleek
[1:33:03] <bigmacjack12> WROOOOOOOONG
[1:33:06] <Gruhunchously> Anyway, about them refugees
[1:33:07] <+GeneralHysterics> ETERNAL IS WAAAAAY BETTER
[1:33:11] <arkv01> noooo you can't just dunk on revan like that! BRRRRrrr haha revan stinky Wowee
[1:33:12] <olaksi> Yeah, Revan is mostly your self insert, less an actual written character
[1:33:20] <lotharrio> Little V, the entire chat agrees with you.
[1:33:22] <jorniev> the exile DOES some shit in this game
[1:33:24] <%siamzero94> YEAH GET FUCKED WOMAN
[1:33:27] <Major_monotone> Hungry boy is so freaking strong as a design
[1:33:29] <Gruhunchously> Space Fucker
[1:33:33] <arkv01> these spaggos
[1:33:34] <+Superspider51> NO THE CHAT DOESN'T
[1:33:38] <%siamzero94> That quest is fucked
[1:33:41] <Scrub_Seeker> spacer with a full throated R
[1:33:49] <CrabSlacks> it;s not the best choice, it's fucker's choice
[1:33:54] <jorniev> in expanse
[1:33:55] <+AsinPersuasion> dummy
[1:33:55] <Jaku2011> Space off!
[1:34:08] <usurper_sos> Chat is a many faced beast
[1:34:10] <+GeneralHysterics> punk'd
[1:34:14] <+Zyquux> Seems legit
[1:34:15] <heartlesshealer> weelllll...
[1:34:16] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:34:22] <olaksi> We are chat, we are many
[1:34:30] <+Superspider51> we are all
[1:34:35] <CookieDoughFK> 50 credits
[1:34:38] <+lag2993> Little V, are you saying that a stupid computer program is more interesting of a character than I the player
[1:34:45] <%siamzero94> Isn't the ithorian the only one who could help her?
[1:34:46] <%alpharius88> aa that guy....
[1:34:50] <Gruhunchously> Is she the same voice actress as the Czerka lady?
[1:34:54] <+Bear_Mane> Republic credits are no good here
[1:35:07] <+krispen_wa> KAWANABOTA
[1:35:10] <arkv01> shukka pakka lakka
[1:35:13] <+Superspider51> HIS NAME IS KEVIN
[1:35:14] <Redblood801> @lag2993 I mean, it's more interesting than me.
[1:35:15] <+AsinPersuasion> yo how mind fucked is woolie gonna be about go-to
[1:35:19] <Gruhunchously> I had no idea about this exchange
[1:35:19] <ZeeJiggle> His name is literally Kevin
[1:35:32] <GarbageNirvana> Lines like that are where the generic alien speak kinda falls apart huh
[1:35:32] <+AsinPersuasion> it might be restored content
[1:35:32] <Major_monotone> Hiiiii Kevin
[1:35:34] <+GeneralHysterics> DA GENERAL
[1:35:34] <usurper_sos> Fancy Kevin
[1:35:37] <ZeeJiggle> New planet, who dat
[1:35:42] <CrabSlacks> kevin the space man
[1:35:44] <%Pillagius> Oh the magical kolto stuff
[1:35:48] <redlanternreviews> Taking regular names and turning them into Star Wars names is the best
[1:35:51] <+taggerung403> why are male twi leks so slimy
[1:35:51] <mistersups> I WAS the War!
[1:35:54] <+mankeyfigh> that kolto is some good shit
[1:35:54] <Gruhunchously> I like how Atton spilled his entire backstory infront of Bao-Dur, and Bao-Dur is just okay with it.
[1:36:00] <+krispen_wa> "I don't want to talk about it" - Carth Onasi

[1:45:11] <%Irridium> I thought you could
[1:45:13] <heartlesshealer> so it's RNG time?
[1:45:15] <Maleicus> nope
[1:45:23] <arkv01> nooo dont touch his hand!
[1:45:26] <Gruhunchously> I'm pretty sure Atton always supercedes Bao Dur in this instance.
[1:45:29] <+Zyquux> Oooh crystal
[1:45:35] <asurite_warrior> just take atton out
[1:45:39] <%siamzero94> just try to change them

[1:46:14] <Gruhunchously> It's always Atton first.
[1:46:20] <+Zyquux> They're not in an area to change party
[1:46:21] <subjectg> one other party member is straight up glitched and you can’t get influenced
[1:46:22] <Graywolf_the_45th> can't you do it from here?
[1:46:22] <%Pillagius> Can't you just switch atton out?
[1:46:28] <ZeeJiggle> Humor chat and see if we can switch them out here.
[1:46:31] <Ki_Memento> try talking to bao after the deed?
[1:46:34] <asurite_warrior> is it to do with the ship thing?
[1:46:35] <+thatotherblackkid> Can you Solo Atton on the other side of the area and keep Bao close to you?
[1:46:37] <alrobot2014> bao is fuck off hard
[1:46:39] <%Pillagius> Or make Atton stand way further away?
[1:46:40] <Gruhunchously> Go find the speeder first
[1:46:40] <pizzadeliveryman> cant they leave the area then do it
[1:46:41] <usurper_sos> Try talking to Bao
[1:46:42] <heartlesshealer> Can you send Atton away and just roll with one member?
[1:46:54] <LunarRemix> Mandalore is way harder
[1:46:56] <Redblood801> can you put Atton in Solo mode
[1:46:58] <+AsinPersuasion> i swear both trigger

[1:47:40] <pizzadeliveryman> save b4 you do it
[1:47:42] <heartlesshealer> Woolie did the mystic dance on Atton
[1:47:42] <fauxfeels> !uptime
[1:47:43] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 47 minutes
[1:47:46] <Halospaz117> Yeah Nar Shadaa has a lot of event triggers
[1:47:58] <+nairdde> OH PLEASE DO, because i just finished and I how no idea how anything works here
[1:48:12] <ZeeJiggle> The sound of John Williams getting up from his chair
[1:48:27] <Halospaz117> God imagine if Atton just teleported back in
[1:48:29] <+AsinPersuasion> i think hes just talking about the "rep" you have to earn to get the exchange to approach you
[1:48:31] <usurper_sos> OLD MAN
[1:48:35] <%siamzero94> BETRAYAL!

[1:50:01] <Halospaz117> Oh jeez she's kinda red
[1:50:02] <%siamzero94> You can totally talk to best girl
[1:50:10] <+Zyquux> Handmaiden > Visas prove me wrong
[1:50:12] <+GeneralHysterics> so tempted by big tiddy sith gf
[1:50:22] <Halospaz117> Yeah but won't good stuff make HK sad?
[1:50:23] <heartlesshealer> Handmaiden's not finished yet, so Visas is at risk
[1:50:32] <Kirlrik> patiently waiting for visas in the dancer's outfit
[1:50:36] <$eco419> LUL
[1:50:37] <+AsinPersuasion> handmaiden is a jealous bitch who turns murderous if you don't notice her
[1:50:39] <pizzadeliveryman> but visas doesn't have short hair
[1:50:42] <%siamzero94> better fashion sense
[1:50:47] <+taggerung403> @Zyquux Visas says My life for yours in a real hot voice
[1:50:54] <Halospaz117> Yeah if Visa's influence goes higher than HM, than HM won't talk to you anymore, so you wanna max HM first
[1:51:00] <+AsinPersuasion> visas just wants to force see you
[1:51:27] <+Zyquux> @taggerung403 Handmaiden fights in her underwear
[1:51:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:51:42] <+Zyquux> Did I miss the pacifist package?
[1:51:54] <+AsinPersuasion> don't think they did it
[1:51:58] <Gruhunchously> But if you get equivocal influence with Visas and Handmaiden, it will trigger their confrontation, and THAT will trigger HK's explanation of love.
[1:52:10] <+taggerung403> Its goth vs tomboy
[1:52:19] <+Superspider51> goth tomboys though
[1:52:24] <%Pillagius> Woolie Retro gaming streams?
[1:52:24] <subjectg> @zyquux that’s way later, don’t worry
[1:52:25] <+taggerung403> A question for the greatest of minds to debate
[1:52:27] <usurper_sos> Bao has a level
[1:52:30] <+AsinPersuasion> visas isn't that goth
[1:52:32] <Halospaz117> @Superspider51 wise
[1:52:34] <%Irridium> big tiddy goth tomboy gf Kreygasm
[1:52:38] <+Zyquux> Corrupted Handmaiden portrait is great
[1:52:39] <+Superspider51> damn straight
[1:52:48] <pizzadeliveryman> blind goth tomboy
[1:52:49] <heartlesshealer> Are they sitting on Bao levels too for the moment?
[1:52:50] <Redblood801> @superspider51 that's some big brain shit right there
[1:52:50] <+Manjove> but Visas is hot tho
[1:52:51] <+Zyquux> @subjectg Really? I thought they can do it right now.
[1:52:54] <+mankeyfigh> @usurper_sos We’re saving this Bao levels
[1:52:58] <DSD24> @Zyquux Doesn't she get a black hood?
[1:53:01] <heartlesshealer> okay cool
[1:53:02] <usurper_sos> Ah okT
[1:53:10] <Gruhunchously> And the refugees are caught in the middle
[1:53:11] <redlanternreviews> Bao's levels are being saved for his prestige class like Atton
[1:53:17] <subjectg> @zyquux nope, need to do 3 planets iirc
[1:53:28] <waffleandman> its bert and ernie LUL
[1:53:29] <+Zyquux> @DSD24 yep and black makeup. You can have best girl AND big tiddy goth gf
[1:53:37] <Gruhunchously> Just like the Sand People

[1:53:56] <DSD24> @Zyquux Man I forgot about the black makeup
[1:53:59] <+Zyquux> @subjectg damn I don't remember this game as much as I thought I did and I've beaten it like 4 times
[1:54:15] <+MidnightBurst12> smells like a dungeon
[1:54:19] <alrobot2014> this base smells like roast pork
[1:54:22] <usurper_sos> Squidward
[1:54:30] <Goodvibes99508> kill them...kill them now.
[1:54:31] <Gruhunchously> Piss off
[1:54:32] <CrabSlacks> this part is great because you get lightside points for picking the "do it or I'll kill you" option
[1:54:37] <+Zyquux> The best dungeons are the ones you fight your way out instead of in
[1:54:42] <FeralRageGaming> censor that head

[2:10:10] <%xcompleasedad> @DSD24 The problem is, is that the Exchange is SO EVIL in this context
[2:10:15] <CrabSlacks> this place probably smells terrible, all these pig men and no toilets
[2:10:16] <rwg3> light side later
[2:10:20] <OldManDeckardCain> funny thing, the whole corona virus thinghy might result ion a baby boom comparable to boomer era LUL

[2:13:41] <jorniev> imagine your insides melting and evaporating as a blue light comes out of your belly
[2:13:41] <Redblood801> This is getting out of hand
[2:13:46] <arkv01> and this is to go even FURTHER
[2:14:33] <%whitey_shamgar> whitey_shamgar subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[2:15:17] <+GeneralHysterics> the KILLdren
[2:15:18] <Maleicus> because items are in there
[2:15:18] <arkv01> thats why they call em zoomers

[2:16:17] <arkv01> ples
[2:16:20] <CrabSlacks> his feet are made of fists
[2:16:41] <CrabSlacks> each toe is a tiny fist for maximum punch power
[2:17:00] <%siamzero94> Now the Space Asians
[2:17:07] <Gruhunchously> The Exchange bosses are not going to like this
[2:17:15] <Graywolf_the_45th> You have exchanged their lives for XP
[2:17:18] <bassoontyphoon> hope everyone is doing well tonight
[2:17:44] <arkv01> they cut back on the budget for security cameras
[2:18:12] <Gruhunchously> Fann should basically be on the Exchange's 'shoot on sight' list. No that is would do them any good.
[2:18:12] <usurper_sos> one guy
[2:18:29] <Gruhunchously> Hooray, you bought us an extra corridor.
[2:18:35] <%siamzero94> Depends what you do next

[2:18:50] <arkv01> free real estate
[2:18:56] <usurper_sos> monkaS
[2:18:58] <%siamzero94> established
[2:19:05] <Gruhunchously> All the Serroco have Asian face models. It's unusual.
[2:19:09] <%gatorafan> thank the force you murdered all those people, we didn't know where to put that one guy.
[2:19:10] <DSD24> The only thing the Exchange needs is a funeral

[2:19:54] <GarbageNirvana> Is it just me or are the Serroco Actual Space Italians
[2:19:55] <Gruhunchously> Because he's a player model
[2:20:03] <bassoontyphoon> such luscious locks of hair
[2:20:06] <+Superspider51> it's Attons hair

[2:32:45] <alrobot2014> john has no qualms with this
[2:32:53] <%gatorafan> such a waste of good hair
[2:33:09] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie's character is just a space communist, private ownership is a foreign concept to him Kappa

[2:36:53] <Gruhunchously> 15-20 guards=1 child
[2:37:02] <olaksi> @Confused_Nina Spreading slavery awareness #lightside
[2:37:05] <heartlesshealer> Did Woolie leave unspent skill points?

They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! hey woolie pro-tip for doom eternal whenever you get to it. you can quit a mission mid-way, go back to older missions with mission select in the main menu, and still come back to where you left off originally. Game's good with mid-mission checkpoints.
[2:39:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> HOES OF FATE LUL

[2:40:09] <dontlookatmestop> hey Little V what do you think of Coheed and Cambria it seems like something youd dig
[2:40:10] <%gatorafan> I see the new collab song is going along nicely
[2:40:16] <Snookasaurus> well you got it now!
[2:40:22] <heartlesshealer> extreme progress

[2:41:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kaiden is for players that thought Carth wasn't boring ENOUGH
[2:41:11] <Goraka91> Wait no it was Carth, welp
[2:41:14] <olaksi> @Goldenwolf98 Thirsty for the Force
[2:41:21] <LeafarOznolam> what happened to Atton? I missed a lot and just tuned in the last hour
[2:41:42] <%Irridium> I love that line. Instead of giving him a clean out they straight up make him awful and you just have to deal with that
[2:41:52] <Goldenwolf98> @olaksi yeah thats the thirst he got Kappa
[2:41:55] <KnivesEve> woah what
[2:41:56] <Goodvibes99508> torture chamber or death?
[2:42:07] <GarbageNirvana> Gotta have that in for the Dark Side somewhere
[2:42:08] <asurite_warrior> you never needed to forgive
[2:42:18] <damienlunas> Atton out there like "AJAB. All Jedi Are Bastards."
[2:42:31] <asurite_warrior> hell it wasnt your forgiveness to give in my opinion
[2:42:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nar Shadaa's the absolute best. Best part's yet to come
[2:43:00] <Goldenwolf98> Onderon is the best how dare you
[2:43:08] <asurite_warrior> Im just some jackoff. The person you need forgiveness from are the ones you killed and yourself

[2:43:33] <mercenaryextraordinary> hey woolie how about you stfu Kappa
[2:43:48] <cowcow6> to ask why we must fight is to ask why the leaves fall
[2:43:54] <Gruhunchously> The worst part about this LP is the wait for the next part.
[2:44:13] <+krispen_wa> exar kun was literally just before KOTOR
[2:44:15] <arkv01> exar kun pog
[2:44:21] <%siamzero94> exar kun was like 40 years before kotor 1
[2:44:23] <Goldenwolf98> Back when everyone was the old busted
[2:44:26] <heartlesshealer> space romans
[2:44:28] <%Irridium> Think Exar Kun was like 40 years before KOTOR 1.
[2:44:31] <subjectg> earliest is tython shit
[2:44:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh, Exar-Kun, you so SUGOI
[2:44:37] <+MidnightBurst12> exar kus was jolee's generation
[2:44:40] <jorniev> that is some gurren lagan shit
[2:44:40] <subjectg> when everybody had katanas
[2:44:42] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Exar Kun is 40 years before Kotor 1 i believe
[2:44:44] <dontlookatmestop> If yall are doing questions then I was wondering if V was into coheed and cambria. They play around with a lot of star wars inspired prog concept album stuff etc
[2:44:52] <heartlesshealer> may or may not bump into something
[2:45:16] <subjectg> Great hyperspace war might be the second split? The first happened way before the sith were a thing?

[2:48:20] <chromdad> avellone loved stat wars but hates the force's will i think
[2:48:44] <Goraka91> Avellone: What if RPG mechanics were real though?
[2:48:47] <Halospaz117> Yeah I'm fairly sure Avellone likes Star Wars, he lust has A LOT of issues with it
[2:48:49] <subjectg> When you get to see more of what happened in the mandalorian wars, you see the kind of things that the jedi and republic had to experience
[2:48:54] <prince_johnny_> Yup
[2:48:58] <ScareLampert> Tell, don't show, can work SOMETIMES, if you know you will never be able to top that.
[2:49:01] <MasterDecoder> KOTOR 2 IS 2006
[2:49:02] <startstoprepeat> there's a really good presentation avellone gave years back where he outright says he hates it iirc
[2:49:04] <olaksi> Dialogue is an acceptable way to tell, as long as it's not too expository

[2:49:31] <jorniev> WHAT IS THE NATURE OF MAN
[2:49:32] <terminallyCapriciousz> DMC3 was 2005, a few months after
[2:49:33] <+mrcooperblack> not gonna lie. until now i didn't know KOTOR was a star wars game. my brain glazed over it all. 10/10 shia surprise
[2:49:36] <chromdad> "give that light saber to me"
[2:49:48] <chromdad> "no way you got your own"
[2:49:57] <Safarihat> legend of heroes: trails in the sky also 2004
[2:50:09] <NaturalGear> Torment and Bloodlines are both superior in terms of writing imho

[2:50:32] <jorniev> PLAY DISCO ELYSIUM
[2:50:35] <+krispen_wa> bloodlines has good dialogue, but player dialogue feels fairly limited
[2:50:56] <alrobot2014> FC's back half got me to buy the sequel almost immediately @Safarihat
[2:51:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Sacrifice Carth at Virmire so you can bork Racist Juhani.

[2:51:29] <+krispen_wa> V has been to the alternate realities
[2:51:33] <+MidnightBurst12> Have we fallen into the right timeline?
[2:51:35] <Safarihat> @alrobot2014 fc and sc are probably the best games ive ever played
[2:51:55] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Chris Avellone was lead writer on Kotor 2 and he helped write for Fallen Order and you can feel his writing when it shows
[2:51:56] <alrobot2014> @Safarihat i put sc up there until i played zero and ao
[2:52:00] <+krispen_wa> Morrowind's Vivec is cool and huge, but also fuck you in terms of traversal
[2:52:03] <olaksi> @Goldenwolf98 to be honest if could timetravel I would also just get games early most of the time LUL
[2:52:20] <RonnyEclipse> i wish i xould of played kotor 3
[2:52:21] <Safarihat> i cant play zero or ao until they come out on pc T_T
[2:52:24] <+ktothec99> It also helped that supplemental stuff like the KOTOR comic are REAL GOOD
[2:52:24] <Goldenwolf98> Taris is a better starting planet than Paragus tho
[2:52:43] <alrobot2014> @Safarihat the fan localisation of zero pc came out a couple weeks back
[2:52:55] <heartlesshealer> Let Woolie experience game and lore
[2:52:55] <+krispen_wa> DOOM ETERNAL SPOILERS - it's good
[2:52:55] <resloxxx> That fast travel was useful to enjoy the game and not worry about the secrets
[2:52:56] <%Pillagius> Let Woolie DOOM it!
[2:53:19] <+Superbro64> People go stupid with excitement in fact
[2:53:21] <Safarihat> @alrobot2014 i dont want to play it until i can support the devs
[2:53:26] <+krispen_wa> Gwent?
[2:53:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> There's a lot of fun goopy goop in Doom Eternal. Good Fun
[2:53:35] <+Superbro64> Hype turns people into 12 year olds sometimes
