[0:08:31] <+TheotherKristian> I am doing ok! 6/10
[0:09:32] <+AngelYoumou> And this is one of the most interesting SMT spinoffs too
[0:09:59] <Blank9> it's surprising atlus was even this good at one of their first arpg attempts
[0:10:27] <+AngelYoumou> I still need to go back and properly play this one someday
[0:10:29] <zenith0111> This is basically proto-P5 Strikers
[0:10:30] <Qu1ckyyy> How many Action RPGs have they made? like 3-4?
[0:11:04] <Blank9> maken x might count, but it's even weirder
[0:11:28] <+AngelYoumou> Oh man, Maken Shao is.....
[0:11:37] <Blank9> first person action with some rpg to it, and kaneko art
[0:11:46] <+AngelYoumou> REALLY bizarre, depending on which version you play
[0:12:06] <+AngelYoumou> The PS2 remake was Third PErson iirc?
[0:12:28] <Blank9> dunno, I only played the dreamcast one that was first person
[0:12:38] <%KiwamiKiryu> KiwamiKiryu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Just wanted to thank you for everything guys and congrats on your future wedding Woolie! Mucho amor desde México!

[1:51:18] <turboyabo> he put too much in str his bullets will just kill it
[1:51:23] <%dds333a> @alphalejandro Tae has gone missing in Kasumidai, and now we have to head for the dark realm to find her. but first, Woolz is taking a detour to find a Raiju in order to get a hidden item in Kasumidai proper
[1:51:50] <Murdercles> i'd just summon from the codex
[1:52:05] <johei_mctaro> can't summon from the compendium, too expensive
[1:52:14] <%dds333a> @turboyabo elemental bullets always do less damage as is. if he just does a single swing, it'll be fine

[1:55:01] <%dds333a> weaker demons can fuse into dramatically stronger demons yeah
[1:55:34] <brunoberserk> provoke is the ''FIGHT ME '' button
[1:55:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can you get rid of provoke manually or does it go away on its own
[1:55:56] <+haitakaa> and you can load them up with good skills and then register them as fusion fodder
[1:56:09] <johei_mctaro> who did they fight previous session?
[1:56:20] <turboyabo> loyalty
[1:56:25] <%dds333a> @johei_mctaro as in bosses?

[2:43:07] <lol_red_ranger> not the car oh god
[2:43:23] <%pupil31> not the honda
[2:43:50] <CosmicBard> big props for taking the bullet and playing this so we don't have to
[2:43:53] <%dds333a> it's more the specific move that can be spammed
[2:44:14] <%dds333a> @cosmicbard as if we haven't already played it LUL
[2:44:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:44:45] <andre11dr> Ive played it a while ago and like twice
[2:44:53] <andre11dr> 2 was definitely better
[2:45:09] <%dds333a> nice spin
[2:45:13] <blackskulldragon18> ok.. did i miss something, why is there a car following Raido?
[2:45:19] <CosmicBard> Synchonicity is my idea of an ARPG SMT game, this just never felt right
[2:45:23] <andre11dr> But compared to the other really fucked up SMTs ,this is fine
[2:45:41] <CosmicBard> I mean this IS one of the fucked up SMTs unless you mean like... shit, Ronde?
[2:45:48] <%dds333a> and it's usually inefficient LUL
[2:46:13] <%dds333a> @blackskulldragon18 sir, this is Raidou, not Raido Kappa
[2:46:21] <andre11dr> @cosmicbard If you think this is fucked up go play P1 or P2
[2:46:45] <blackskulldragon18> @dds333a typo
[2:46:55] <%dds333a> @cosmicbard nah, not even close. P2 itself is great. too, with issues
[2:46:57] <CosmicBard> I like P1/P2
[2:47:00] <plushysceptile> This is really light in the whole of the SMT-verse honestly. Small scope too
[2:47:05] <CosmicBard> P1 was my first SMT game
[2:47:19] <turboyabo> gouto holding your debt over your head
[2:47:32] <andre11dr> Yeah but they're objectively more fucked up than this
[2:47:39] <%dds333a> @blackskulldragon18 don't worry, I was joking LUL it might make more sense later Kappa
[2:47:44] <lol_red_ranger> SET ME FREE
[2:47:44] <+vaderxyz1970> Aim gun at Gouto
[2:47:46] <teefpal> "Raidou, did you get the body down from the tree?"
[2:47:50] <CosmicBard> I definitely don't agree with 'objectively' lol
[2:47:51] <andre11dr> This you can beat by yourself relatively easily
[2:47:55] <%livlinn> shiaLUL
[2:48:20] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:48:27] <andre11dr> The biggest problem with this game is the encounter rate
[2:48:29] <turboyabo> that zombie came in swing in
[2:48:30] <%dds333a> about to get his wig split
[2:48:50] <%dds333a> @andre11dr this, with a bullet
[2:49:06] <andre11dr> And there's some questionable dungeons but that's just SMT in general
[2:49:11] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[2:49:23] <alphalejandro> What about Nocturne, isn't that game like one of the hardest ones?
[2:49:32] <johei_mctaro> can you catch a zombo
[2:49:45] <%dds333a> yes, but some overrate its difficulty
[2:50:00] <%dds333a> it is still an overall great challenge
[2:50:22] <andre11dr> Regular Nocturne is not that bad
[2:50:24] <stormhawk9891> @alphalejandro In the same way Dark Souls is hard in that people overblow the difficulty
[2:50:33] <CosmicBard> Nocturne is fine
[2:50:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Report spells out S E N D N U D S
[2:50:39] <CosmicBard> Pretty middle of the road
[2:50:41] <DSD24> Snake Lady
[2:50:48] <andre11dr> But Hard TDE Nocturne is sure one hell of a challenge
[2:50:50] <CosmicBard> Go play Majin Tensei and get back to me
[2:51:11] <johei_mctaro> most "hard" rpg are very manageable once you get into it
[2:51:19] <%dds333a> oftentimes they throw in demons thay synergize . the game keeps you guessing from time to time

[2:51:28] <teefpal> Strange Journey Neutral is hard as balls
[2:51:28] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:51:46] <CosmicBard> SJ Neutral is hard, yeah
[2:51:52] <CosmicBard> But not that crazy
[2:52:02] <andre11dr> Yeah SJ Neutral is pretty hard
[2:52:38] <andre11dr> That's wierd you'd think it'll be the other way but no
[2:52:48] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:52:49] <andre11dr> Chaos and Law are easier
[2:52:50] <teefpal> That sitcom sting that plays all the time is so annoying
[2:53:07] <Sapphire_Breeze> DxCat
[2:53:11] <teefpal> Its hard to get the good ending in SJ
[2:53:15] <CosmicBard> I would go out on a limb and say neutral is always the hard path
[2:53:16] <%dds333a> @teefpal how dare you Kappa
[2:53:18] <CosmicBard> Well almost always
[2:53:39] <johei_mctaro> makes sense, path of most resistance
[2:53:54] <andre11dr> The true ending path is usually the hardest if there is one
[2:54:20] <DSD24> Vile Storm sounds cool
[2:54:37] <%dds333a> @andre11dr yes, although the overwhelming majority of SMT games don't have "true endings" LUL
[2:54:46] <+Grayhammatter> some spicy battles in this place
[2:55:23] <Sonicdy> Buster wolf?
[2:55:26] <%dds333a> let's go
[2:55:32] <DSD24> Oh shit
[2:55:38] <andre11dr> @dds333a Yeah but you know which ones i mean, SMT 3 and 4 ,Persona ,shit like that
[2:55:46] <alphalejandro> The YAMATO?
[2:55:57] <DSD24> Theree's the title!
[2:55:58] <%arkv01> he said THE THING
[2:56:04] <+Grayhammatter> he said the thing
[2:56:05] <andre11dr> TITLE DROOOP
[2:56:08] <+akikyou> YATA YAMATO
[2:56:48] <rustybuckethead21> gentlemen, we have a title
[2:56:51] <DSD24> Nebiros is cool
[2:56:54] <turboyabo> yooooo uncle nebiros
[2:56:55] <andre11dr> Oh boy these two
[2:57:11] <%arkv01> mmm yes I'll take one makkinations
[2:57:16] <+Grayhammatter> woof, that's a big boi
[2:57:17] <andre11dr> Oh wait it's just Nebiros here
[2:57:32] <%dds333a> @andre11dr somewhat, yeah. but Nocturne doesn't have a true ending, and neither does IV. True Demon is only called "True" because it's the complete "Demon" ending. and IV has a canon ending, somewhat, but not a true ending. Apocalypse takes place while neutral is taking place.
[2:57:42] <Sonicdy> Sword? But gun?
[2:57:48] <%meniscate> Uncle Nebiros
[2:57:56] <+Grayhammatter> wow LUL
[2:58:03] <%dds333a> @andre11dr also yeah, Red Count comes later LUL
[2:58:04] <%pupil31> The Equalizer
[2:58:05] <DSD24> Nebiros's weakness is getting shot

[2:58:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:58:24] <andre11dr> @dds333a to me true endings are the ones that give you the most content
[2:58:24] <%meniscate> Just realized Nebiros is barefoot Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:58:28] <+Grayhammatter> that... certainly was a boss
[2:58:30] <%dds333a> @alphalejandro yup, they're GUN

[2:59:22] <turboyabo> yes
[2:59:22] <johei_mctaro> still alive, and pursued by supernatural abominations for the rest of his life
[2:59:28] <brunoberserk> NOT AGAIN
[2:59:39] <%dds333a> @andre11dr I suppose, but that's not what's understood within the Japanese lexicon, where "True" refers to the actual, legitimate ending
[2:59:42] <johei_mctaro> I want to wake up from this Quantic Dream
[2:59:44] <+DragonArt07> first china now japan

[3:00:40] <%meniscate> Underwater Japanese Yakuza Battleship
[3:00:41] <DSD24> Bruce Willis kills Jack Black in that movie

[3:00:50] <alphalejandro> Tae*
[3:01:04] <%dds333a> @tearonex Chinese but i thought this was Japanese LUL
[3:01:23] <andre11dr> I'm pretty sure Tae is fucking dead
[3:01:58] <andre11dr> She's been there  for like a couple of hours
[3:02:01] <johei_mctaro> If Tae dies you can catch her in a tube
[3:02:05] <DSD24> "I need you to run"
[3:02:32] <DSD24> Then Jack Black's arm gets blown off
[3:02:46] <alphalejandro> Raidou's menacing
[3:03:02] <johei_mctaro> I remember when Sora told Riku he can smell his Darkness
[3:03:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Put a cat in a blender?
[3:03:37] <%dds333a> I bet Raidou actually does sleep upstairs LUL

[3:24:11] <fuji_n2> are you ready to find out sir?
[3:24:13] <rustybuckethead21> pyro Gdon is MOTIVATED!
[3:24:14] <%DashXero> Sounds like you need fifteen seconds of finding out...
[3:24:26] <+Grayhammatter> seems about time to find out
[3:24:31] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:24:36] <%dds333a> never got taken in
[3:25:19] <johei_mctaro> every time I saw one I just waited for someone to get fucked up, I knew it was gonna happen
[3:25:20] <Qu1ckyyy> they are also hungry
[3:25:22] <Idon__> "It is my nature."
[3:25:26] <xeros720> i hope those chipmunks in new zealand get their revenge one day
[3:25:30] <%RigmaroleHM> But you're also yummy
[3:25:30] <andre11dr> Negative sympathy, isn't that empathy
[3:25:34] <lol_red_ranger> maybe I'm a lion
[3:25:38] <fuji_n2> bring that monkey a gun
[3:25:41] <DSD24> But why did the scorpion sting the frog
[3:25:42] <%DashXero> That was a fucking accident.
[3:25:44] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:25:46] <%pupil31> Damn
[3:25:46] <Treasure_Vault> I still remember finding out on the runescape forums
[3:25:46] <%dds333a> you shouldn't have trusted me for. I was a scorpion Kappa
[3:25:48] <DSD24> Lol he said lmao
[3:25:51] <teefpal> "Yeah, I'm a wild animal, I feel kinda crushed by your expectations, bruh"
[3:26:04] <xeros720> was surprised it was a stingray really
[3:26:16] <xeros720> it's like achilles heel
[3:26:24] <%meniscate> based stingray
[3:26:24] <%DashXero> He didn't check for stingrays...
[3:26:35] <%dds333a> mostly inasmuch as because I didn't know him. but yeah
[3:26:35] <%pupil31> He knew the risks
[3:26:40] <+mczarklesby> I remember reading that the tiger was acting protectively / set off by the audience & crowd. That was a FRIENDLY tiger injury.
[3:26:40] <%baka_sugoi> Cold Blooded
[3:26:40] <teefpal> Steve Irwin wouldn't have been mad, though, he understood the risks
[3:26:44] <johei_mctaro> you roll the dice and shit happens, what else to expect
[3:26:50] <+Kyma1020> It sucks that's all.
[3:26:50] <%meniscate> yes he deserved to die and I hope he burns in hell
[3:26:51] <fuji_n2> "but that way both of us will die" "lol... lmao. .."
[3:26:51] <Idon__> Mankind knew they could not change beasts, so they blamed society.
[3:26:56] <%RigmaroleHM> As much as he messed around with crocodiles I remember thinking it was only a matter of time
[3:27:10] <%dds333a> there it is LUL
[3:27:13] <andre11dr> "let me put my arm around this bear and take a selfie, what could possibly happen" said guy that got his face eaten
[3:27:26] <xeros720> okikumushis are cheap though
[3:27:29] <%DashXero> Guy known for fucking with crocodiles dies because he forgot to check for stingrays...
[3:27:40] <%DashXero> Can't write that shit.
[3:27:45] <skagtheprinceofhell> @RigmaroleHM That's the thing, it wasn't even a croc or something. It was a random stingray that got close. That could happen to any diver.
[3:27:49] <teefpal> @meniscate Steve Irwin?
[3:27:50] <%dds333a> I had a feeling this is how calcs eould work, like the feature in devil survivor
[3:27:58] <skagtheprinceofhell> Like that one Jackass dude who died in a car accident randomly.
[3:28:09] <Treasure_Vault> Irwin's mistletoe

[3:28:14] <%dds333a> although I haven't actually used a fusion calc. can you also input values too?
[3:28:26] <@Solidus_113> also Paul Walker
[3:28:36] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Ryan was a alcholic
[3:28:54] <teefpal> The stingray thing was borderline freak accident, usually they get the limbs
[3:29:01] <skagtheprinceofhell> But he got clean was the sad part I thought?
[3:29:09] <xeros720> i arrived late, what are they trying to get?
[3:29:20] <Twon_From_Wakanda> And paul wasnt even driving the car thats the sad part
[3:29:20] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:29:37] <%dds333a> @xeros720 they're setting up for an Ichimokuren currently

[3:30:04] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Ryan was in and out wiyh being clean.

[3:36:52] <RyuuAoi> THIS IS SMT.

[3:37:46] <rustybuckethead21> this reminds of spending 60% of the time I played Persona 3 on the velvet room, fusing demons/personas.
[3:38:33] <andre11dr> Ok i looked it ,i was thinking of Shesha
[3:38:33] <xeros720> and booze
[3:38:43] <%DashXero> Everything has an expiration date.
[3:38:46] <fuji_n2> na he 100% loyal now
[3:38:48] <%dds333a> he was a bit cross eyed too
[3:38:53] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Anyone with switch knowledge? Should i get the new one or just get a regular switch? I feel like smt5 and nmh3 could use new hardware
[3:39:17] <xeros720> the new one is just an oled screen, so it'll look better in handheld
[3:39:18] <andre11dr> Also Shesha is soometimes Ananta so that's confusing
[3:39:25] <DSD24> I see Yoshitsune!
[3:39:27] <%DashXero> @Twon_From_Wakanda Either or, really.
[3:39:30] <xeros720> if you plan on just playing them on your tv, then just get the older cheaper one
[3:39:34] <%dds333a> @andre11dr right that's what was throwing me
[3:40:00] <alphalejandro> It's Zero
[3:40:07] <%dds333a> Japan loves giant eyeballs. peiord
[3:40:14] <%dds333a> even before Zero
[3:40:34] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Ah i gotcha. Probably will get a used one then Silverhand
[3:40:35] <%dds333a> LUL
[3:40:37] <brunoberserk> looks like the final villain of fullmetal alchemist
[3:41:04] <skagtheprinceofhell> Was that a fucking car?
[3:41:10] <DSD24> yes
[3:41:10] <xeros720> yes
[3:41:13] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[3:41:13] <%dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell yes
[3:41:14] <rustybuckethead21> yes
[3:41:14] <+vaderxyz1970> yes
[3:41:20] <andre11dr> Why does Japan love eyeball spheres?
[3:41:31] <skagtheprinceofhell> Gazers are cool.
[3:41:49] <ImChilliP> I just finished playing through P4 Golden, i completely understand
[3:41:50] <skagtheprinceofhell> Also I think this was when DnD got popular.
[3:41:51] <andre11dr> I just remembered if the Radiou 2 final boss
[3:41:55] <xeros720> are beholders the same thing with a different name or something else?
[3:42:01] <andre11dr> That thing is shit
[3:42:16] <%dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell I think that was considerably earlier than this
[3:42:17] <skagtheprinceofhell> Same genus I believe.
[3:42:31] <%dds333a> @xeros720 they're not related at all, in fact.
[3:42:56] <skagtheprinceofhell> No, I watched a video on this. Japan liked Call of Cuthulu more during the time DnD was popular in the US
[3:43:19] <%dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell crazy LUL
[3:43:35] <skagtheprinceofhell> Also for some reason a lot of women were in to it.
[3:43:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:43:52] <+vaderxyz1970> Go to the Island
[3:44:10] <andre11dr> You'd think Japan would be into Lovecraft, so much tentacle potential
[3:44:40] <+vaderxyz1970> sorry backseating
[3:44:40] <skagtheprinceofhell> Like I said, a lot of women liked Call of Cuthulu to.
[3:44:42] <xeros720> i was gonna suggest saving, but even the game is like, "get out of here, you're gonna die"
[3:44:44] <%dds333a> ONLY floor, in fact LUL
[3:45:17] <+Grayhammatter> too scrubby
[3:45:30] <brunoberserk> '' you smell like BITCH , Raidou ''

[3:47:40] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:47:43] <%heartlesshealer> this car just going up and down stairs
[3:47:45] <%dds333a> @xeros720 unfortunately sneak is for tight spaces
[3:48:05] <%dds333a> also, I'm all but certain it did work LUL
[3:48:05] <xeros720> isn't there an ability to reduce encounter rate?
[3:48:13] <KahnWick> Why did a car go through a door?
[3:48:25] <andre11dr> Damn they're dying to fast, we don't get to hear Nue

[3:51:19] <brunoberserk> '' you didnt win ''
[3:51:26] <%dds333a> @skagtheprinceofhell also, the code isn't long, but you getkey cards, and the password is written on the back of one, which you wouldn't realize unless you  checked it LUL there's an npc you go back to to ask for the password, and he also just tell you it's written on the card LUL
[3:51:27] <skagtheprinceofhell> Well, guess we felt sorry for them not to cut them down

[4:07:30] <turboyabo> oh yeah he used provek back in the city
[4:07:58] <%dds333a> generally, the encounter rate is standard within towns, in the Dark Realm and special dungeons it's marginally higher, and is gone in other zones
[4:08:07] <RyuuAoi> Thank you for playing this, @woolieversus. HONESTLY. Finally. Somebody DO IT.
[4:08:25] <RyuuAoi> Only took...ten years? Ha
[4:08:26] <%dds333a> @turboyabo yeah, but you're still correct in that it's higher in this specific zone, by some degree
[4:09:02] <Buddha0991> are they gonna play the sequel
[4:09:22] <andre11dr> Not for a long time
[4:09:29] <%dds333a> @buddha0991 he hasn't mentioned it as of yet, but who knows

[4:11:03] <%dds333a> the raidou swag confers passive buffs Kappa
[4:11:20] <RyuuAoi> @skagtheprinceofhell GO RESEARCH SMT NOW. Stay off of eBay...
[4:11:27] <andre11dr> Honestly if they're gonna play another SMT after this i would rather see DDS than the sequel to this
[4:11:35] <Buddha0991> tho technically this is devil summoner 3 and the sequel is 4 but 1 and 2 are so different its basically a difftent series but the same lore
[4:12:00] <jetstreamlove_R> it imagine the sequel more dmc combat oriented
[4:12:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:12:11] <%dds333a> @andre11dr dude, I wish, but judging by what Woolz has mentioned before, it seems like he's played them before
[4:12:17] <RyuuAoi> I want Survivor but Digital Devil Saga could be dope too
[4:12:28] <%dds333a> maybe we could get a ReggieVs
[4:12:38] <alphalejandro> ...Ok
[4:12:40] <andre11dr> Woolie has said he only played SMT 4
[4:12:48] <Buddha0991> also 1 and 2 take place in the modern day/near future, these two take place in the 20's
[4:12:50] <fuji_n2> LUL
[4:12:53] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:12:56] <%pupil31> KKona
[4:13:13] <%dds333a> @andre11dr has he? in a saltybet episode on the channel, he referenced DDS2
[4:13:23] <RyuuAoi> Woolie is a COWARD and will NEVER play PERSONA
[4:13:26] <alphalejandro> Oh no
[4:13:26] <lol_red_ranger> was he about to say maga
[4:13:27] <%dds333a> that's piddly LUL
[4:13:31] <Buddha0991> eaaaat you whooole
[4:13:47] <%dds333a> @andre11dr but yeah, I could be wrong, maybe he just knows about it
[4:14:01] <andre11dr> @dds333a Probably somebody told him something, cause he said only played 4
[4:14:05] <jetstreamlove_R> hey classic smt negotiation
[4:14:07] <Murdercles> the mag is actually nothing
[4:14:23] <kingra> HORNY DEMON
[4:14:31] <andre11dr> And obviously he played P3 4 and 5 but everyone has played those
[4:14:37] <RyuuAoi> He touched
[4:14:38] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:14:38] <Buddha0991> the sequel to this actually has classic smt negotiation over the weakness tube system button mashing
[4:14:48] <andre11dr> Where not impressed by those around here
[4:14:51] <turboyabo> no woolie mag mag might be nothing
[4:14:59] <RyuuAoi> He touched Persona 2. Wish he would finish on his own time!
[4:15:12] <%dds333a> @andre11dr yeah, he has mentioned that shmup pat. has put him on to stuff, so maybe that's where
[4:15:33] <Buddha0991> persona 2, some of the best stories in the entire series, but the gameplay is baaaaad, I actually kind of like persona 1 gameplay too lmao

[4:16:44] <Blank9> because they just say you're a wimp for doing that
[4:16:53] <RyuuAoi> @buddha0991 LOVED Persona 1 on the PSP! Fucked around and got the bad end. Played that bitch from the beginning all over again. I LOVE that shit!
[4:17:18] <Buddha0991> If I remember right in smtiv you want to give them 2things and then turn them down
[4:17:20] <andre11dr> @dds333a Ah yes, that makes more sense

[4:18:03] <turboyabo> bosss fight
[4:18:04] <andre11dr> I don't know how people finish P1 ,i touched that shit and was like NOPE
[4:18:15] <Buddha0991> also persona 1 has like an entire hidden campaign that changes the entire story, it would be so weird to imagine p5 with something like that
[4:18:22] <andre11dr> Finished 2 tho ,that has a ras endgame
[4:18:38] <andre11dr> It's really jank tho and kinda bad LUL

[4:19:38] <RyuuAoi> @buddha0991 Morgana?
[4:19:47] <jetstreamlove_R> road kill!
[4:19:48] <+Grayhammatter> big strong car

[4:20:10] <Buddha0991> yea it would be chris the car over this car demon
[4:20:16] <turboyabo> the warriors of death are nothing compared to car

[4:21:54] <Buddha0991> I know everyone wants terminator to come back but in smt2 terminator is not a demon but a human enemy
[4:21:57] <%dds333a> @ryuuaoi he could at least get close, yeah
[4:22:12] <Buddha0991> those tend to never carry over
[4:22:33] <RyuuAoi> @dds333a Always a fucking hassle BibleThump
[4:22:41] <Kira2993> SourPls
[4:22:46] <andre11dr> There's a bunch of wierd pop culture demons in SMT 2 that are never returning
[4:22:53] <%dds333a> @buddha0991 yeah, I never got that. although those foul and haunt dudes at least do carry over, like Patriot or Rastaman
[4:22:53] <+Grayhammatter> wow, gdon killing it
[4:23:09] <Buddha0991> they also had audrey from little shop of horrors
[4:23:19] <%dds333a> it would be neat if Terminator returned, but yeah
[4:23:22] <Buddha0991> patriot is a demon so he was able to carry over
[4:23:28] <jetstreamlove_R> Fire 🐯 Fire 🐅
[4:23:47] <Buddha0991> kinda view that guy as the compromise for terminator but it's not exactly the same
[4:23:49] <%dds333a> @buddha0991 yeah, I suppose, but does tattoo man count as a demon?
[4:23:50] <turboyabo> dont wory gdon will do all the work
[4:24:11] <jetstreamlove_R> Kill it Seajima!
[4:24:12] <Buddha0991> yea for some reason @dds333a
