[0:00:46] <%X2Eliah> @derap41 its just Woolie being proud
[0:00:47] <MrPedrovsky> Damn Reggie’s cut looking hella fresh @woolieversus
[0:00:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why can't it be winter already
[0:00:53] <%servicesuspension> humid>moist>wet
[0:00:59] <%derap41> @derap41 Woolie wanting to be big
[0:01:08] <Demoliboy2> which character do you play woolie?
[0:01:16] <%Afterman_> @derap41 I think its camera zoom lol
[0:01:30] <%derap41> @Afterman_ Well yeah of course it is
[0:01:48] <%DkLordG> DkLordG subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Lieutenant Double Yefreitor Kirby looks at Meta Knight and says, "You're black."
[0:02:01] <%X2Eliah> @Afterman_ mmmm no I'm pretty sure it is IRL inflation
[0:02:07] <%Afterman_> tru
[0:02:27] <%Juriasu> I'm hard stuck on 9, Millia struggle is real sometimes
[0:02:32] <Brandon__Brando> stuck on floor 8 this is my first fighting game im taking seriously
[0:02:41] <%nintega010> I'm on floor 8
[0:02:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol im on 4 i am big scrub
[0:02:54] <%DkLordG> floor 4 lol
[0:02:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> You can de-rank pretty easily right? I bet a lot of people are floating just on the edge
[0:02:59] <+Stormiercashew> sounds reminiscent of ELO hell in MOBAs
[0:03:13] <DianaTheAscian> I've been living on floor 8 and 7 since launch
[0:03:18] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'm on 8 right now, taking it easy before I go hard to Celestial. Got tournaments to think about soon.
[0:03:19] <Brandon__Brando> I love the floor system
[0:03:24] <@Solidus_113> yeah this'll likely end up elo hell
[0:03:27] <Johannen> Is it any different from normal ranked system like LoL or Starcraft?
[0:03:28] <@Solidus_113> after long enough
[0:03:35] <+whoami777> yo you see bill cosbys out of jail on a technicality
[0:03:55] <laserbeaming> it takes so many consecutive wins to rank up!
[0:03:57] <%TheotherKristian> Guilty Gear Strive is some good fighting game shit!
[0:04:01] <%X2Eliah> yeah avoiding terrible first impressions is crucial
[0:04:09] <elmo_s_friend> hggGuapo_HF majinoSession_HF
[0:04:10] <%X2Eliah> @whoami777 ye
[0:04:14] <stormhawk9891> I'm on floor 8, till I get cocky and get kicked down to 7 trying to fight people on floor 9
[0:04:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> idk why against bots i can kiiinda do some semi competent shit but the second i go against a player my brain shuts off and i can only manage to mash
[0:04:27] <%TheotherKristian> Yeah, losing to someone 8 to 1 can be pretty demoralizing
[0:04:41] <%X2Eliah> #CosbyIsLoose
[0:04:58] <notadeasterisk> but what if you are the killer
[0:04:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:05:10] <Brandon__Brando> @cobalt_phoenix_ just give it time irl people presser more then cpu you'll get use to it
[0:05:10] <zeekayart> it's so bright in the rooms you're in now LOL
[0:05:20] <+PkSilent01> Did I miss anything
[0:05:27] <@Solidus_113> the never ending pools that are floors 1-6
[0:05:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ bit by bit yeah
[0:05:29] <T_Sasquatch> thats fair tho
[0:05:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah fuck those people
[0:05:37] <%derap41> Now you know how PC gamers feel
[0:05:38] <%Dakuu75> I dunno if that's true...
[0:05:43] <asdief_> no one has a ps5
[0:05:43] <Brandon__Brando> ya but no one has a ps5
[0:05:45] <srv4254> ps5 owners being mad huh boo fucking hoo
[0:05:47] <linSP> They let Cosby out of prison?
[0:05:48] <zeekayart> they don't even have enough PS5s lolol
[0:05:51] <%servicesuspension> to be fair, consoles always waste like 99% of their potential
[0:05:57] <%Seancicle> ⬇️↙️⬅️
[0:05:58] <T_Sasquatch> both things can be true
[0:06:02] <%kyh9> "WHAT ABOUT US, THE PEOPLE WITH $400-500+ TO SPARE FOR A NEW CONSOLE AT LAUNCH?! WHY WONT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT US?"
[0:06:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> This semiconductor shortage is hella fucked
[0:06:05] <%MrAtheGreat> I mean if ps5s were available to everyone then
[0:06:18] <%servicesuspension> we need new ps2 games
[0:06:19] <%Lion_kun> Got my PS5 hahahaha
[0:06:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> or I guess it's a microchip shortage rather
[0:06:25] <T_Sasquatch> @kyh9 they paid good money for a product, they have a right to be upset
[0:06:26] <+fetrigon> majinoSkiip fuck em
[0:06:28] <%jinking79> the amount of luck getting a ps5
[0:06:29] <Johannen> Even if PS5 were widely availible Strive was in dev porb before the platfrom was a thing
[0:06:32] <%X2Eliah> You know if Stadia was functioning, this would not be a problem
[0:06:32] <@Solidus_113> HOW THOUGH
[0:06:36] <%LCLSmoothie> i got mine hehehe
[0:06:44] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Then all those studios also lose money because they don't sell as many units
[0:06:46] <@Solidus_113> How does development change because of PS4
[0:06:47] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[0:06:48] <notadeasterisk> it's cyberpunk
[0:06:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE SPITTIN
[0:06:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BUT MMMMMMEEEEEEE THO
[0:06:52] <%kyh9> @T_Sasquatch They still have the console, it still works doesn't it? It still runs PS5 versions of games
[0:06:53] <%Juriasu> eehhhh, they can adjust the visuals and framerate and that kind of thing for different hardware
[0:06:54] <themrslimeguy> Preach Woolie
[0:07:00] <RushUnplugged> literally fuck off, rich kid. You just want your toy to be more exclusive to feel superior.
[0:07:02] <%the_Punktuation> we've just seen the worst case scenario, look at Cyberpunk.
[0:07:03] <%LCLSmoothie> real shit
[0:07:07] <%MrAtheGreat> It’s business. They can’t sell a product if there’s no demand.
[0:07:07] <%Lion_kun> Just optimize it for PS4 and PS5.
[0:07:19] <%X2Eliah> Also, how shitty of a take is "booo I want mah graphix"
[0:07:20] <%Lion_kun> PS4 Alloy takes forever to open a door.
[0:07:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> I just got here, what is the conversation?
[0:07:29] <T_Sasquatch> im not defending them , but i can understand them, thats all
[0:07:30] <%kyh9> Also, people talking about "taking advantage of the PS5's capabilities" like it has a secret 4K60fps button that devs don't use because they have to make a PS4 version. The biggest change from PS5-only games to cross-gen games is the presence of loading hallways. That's literally going to be it
[0:07:34] <@Menitta> See I'm okay with games being made for ps4 because that means they will be 60fps on ps5
[0:07:36] <@Solidus_113> Stadia?
[0:07:39] <%Lion_kun> PS5 Alloy does it in a second because she works out.
[0:07:42] <JetpackMcQuack> R&C is your litmus test
[0:07:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Menitta smart
[0:07:49] <%MrAtheGreat> YO YOU THINK PEOPLE BOUGHT VIRTUA BOY GAMES
[0:07:50] <%eanscrale> isn't that already happening?
[0:07:50] <%jinking79> i wish Rift Apart was on the ps4 for my friends
[0:08:03] <linSP> I guess people don’t like games!
[0:08:05] <zeekayart> games are hard
[0:08:19] <+fetrigon> @kyh9 adaptive triggers and hd rumble are pretty sick my dude.
[0:08:20] <notadeasterisk> exclusives are temporary now a days.
[0:08:23] <T_Sasquatch> remember when they said godfall was a ps5 exclusive and it will never run on previous gen LUL
[0:08:29] <@Menitta> it is a shame that theres not a lot of use of the tech in ps5 but eh
[0:08:32] <Johannen> PC players looking at PS5 superior system: First time eh?
[0:08:38] <die_hardman> Yoo
[0:08:43] <%kyh9> @fetrigon Yeah but the PS5 version of a cross-gen game can use them. They don't require the game to not be on PS4 as well
[0:08:50] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:08:52] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:08:53] <+gitgouda> its super weird
[0:09:03] <%X2Eliah> It kills off their romance
[0:09:06] <DianaTheAscian> ITS WEIRD
[0:09:10] <+JustBlubs> Imagine if Ryu and M. Bison learned they were siblings. Talk about awkward
[0:09:14] <%eanscrale> Now the rivalry is "SCREW YOU DAD"
[0:09:16] <%BisoromiBear> Every part of that family dynamic is super weird.
[0:09:25] <@Menitta> "Fuck you Hope boy"
[0:09:29] <@Solidus_113> back from the holy order days
[0:09:31] <%MrAtheGreat> Ky boned my daughter, omg Sol’s my dad
[0:09:31] <%jinking79> Ky calling Sol Dad sbfpSetIn
[0:09:38] <%TheotherKristian> Sup y'all, watching that lore series really helped in encouraging me to buy GG Strive!
[0:09:39] <+gitgouda> sol dad of all guy
[0:09:41] <%kyh9> SUGAR WATER
[0:09:42] <Lefteron> boys i got the vaccine yesterday. today I've been struggling with 39 c fever.
[0:09:43] <Eger007> Hi, Dad
[0:09:53] <+fetrigon> @kyh9 wait, is that what's actually being argued?? bruh fuck whoever says it shouldn't be on the ps4 LUL
[0:09:55] <%eanscrale> "Thanks SON" - Freddie Badguy.
[0:09:58] <DianaTheAscian> I still want that GG thanksgiving special
[0:09:59] <@Menitta> is Sol homeless
[0:10:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lefteron hang in there, hope it passes soon
[0:10:04] <die_hardman> Toxic masculinity Kappa
[0:10:11] <twoto858> @DianaTheAscian For real, all I ask for is one dinner scene
[0:10:13] <MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus That Stripping lore watch-along was hilarious. Thanks for shouting him out
[0:10:13] <+KillerCrocomire> Is woolie doing lore for strive or nah?
[0:10:20] <@Solidus_113> Sol is pretty homeless yeah LUL
[0:10:23] <%X2Eliah> @KillerCrocomire nah
[0:10:24] <spaceitaly> @lefteron power through it, drink plenty
[0:10:27] <BlackermanZX> Sol Dadguy
[0:10:27] <%MrAtheGreat> Father’s day is fun at the Badguy house.
[0:10:28] <RushUnplugged> @Lefteron lots of water, get tylenol or any flu med,and it should be gone in a day
[0:10:29] <DonatelloJose> @KillerCrocomire not unless they pay him again
[0:10:38] <+mechslayer71> we gonna see woolley bait today PogChamp
[0:10:39] <Eger007> SOl best Dad
[0:10:43] <%kewlmyc> Good ol sugar water
[0:10:48] <%Lion_kun> Too gay bro
[0:10:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:11:02] <Armosis> @WoolieVersus is blazblue lore worth getting into?
[0:11:05] <+whoami777> Strive story mode felt like watching mgs cutscenes through an anime filter
[0:11:06] <+fetrigon> majinoWeebey
[0:11:06] <themrslimeguy> LUL
[0:11:06] <%kyh9> @fetrigon Yeah, a handful of PS5 devs (see: Colin Moriarty) are angry that SOME new PS5 exclusives are also available on PS4 until at least until next year. It's dumb
[0:11:15] <Lefteron> @cobalt_phoenix_ supposedly it lasts one day. I've been taking painkillers to get through
[0:11:15] <%X2Eliah> @Lefteron that sucks man. hydrate and try to stay cool. frequent showers might help a lot
[0:11:16] <%Juriasu> Ice cream yes that is a good idea
[0:11:19] <@Menitta> I like that lmao. Ky looks at Homeless Sol and says "it's better for you to raise him"
[0:11:22] <%kewlmyc> Blazblue Lore manages to be more confusing than GG and KH
[0:11:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Armosis NO NO NO STAY AWAY......
[0:11:28] <user_naim> H E A T Z O N E
[0:11:37] <MrPedrovsky> WOOLIE BACK IN THE HOTZONE
[0:11:40] <+RowenCleric> fathers day special when
[0:11:41] <leith_aziz> Im a bit late for the stream sorry
[0:11:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lefteron yea for me the day after was extra rough, then the next day still felt kinda out of it but not nearly as bad
[0:11:56] <$eco419> LuvSign

[0:12:24] <Indigo_Automaton> MGS3 was my entrypoint
[0:12:27] <user_naim> Deja Vu
[0:12:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ive only played MGR
[0:12:28] <%servicesuspension> mgs4 had the ipod, thus the best one
[0:12:30] <spaceitaly> the spine still rebels, it must be put in its place
[0:12:31] <%MrAtheGreat> MGS3 was mine
[0:12:31] <Blank9> I got in on 2 too
[0:12:35] <leith_aziz> Also I know we all joke about the insanity of GG lore, and yeah its insane. Despite that, I do like the story and characters and think its great. Am I alone on that?

[0:12:44] <+Slimperton> Mgs4 was my first, still loved it lol
[0:12:44] <%Mathochism> MGS1, baby!
[0:12:45] <Johannen> I only played MGSV
[0:12:46] <DianaTheAscian> I remember the tv adds for mgs4
[0:12:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> haven't touched the others yet
[0:12:50] <exnuart> i didn't understand anything but i found the game fun
[0:12:52] <Eger007> i got in on MGS5
[0:12:55] <%MrAtheGreat> I got in ff with x-2
[0:12:59] <asdief_> I got into FF through Dissidia, didn't know who cloud is. not as bad as mgs4 though
[0:13:01] <user_naim> I got in on Ground Zeroes when it was free. Then played release order
[0:13:04] <%servicesuspension> well, even starting on 1 I was like WHO THE FUCK IS MILLER
[0:13:17] <%DkLordG> the Xbox 360 didn't have 1 or 4 so I haven't played those yet
[0:13:19] <leith_aziz> I always try to give something the best attention I can give it to give it a fair shot
[0:13:22] <%MrAtheGreat> my dad got in with MGSV
[0:13:29] <T_Sasquatch> i got in on mgsv and mgs2, i dont care LUL
[0:13:29] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[0:13:30] <@Solidus_113> THAT character
[0:13:31] <%Seancicle> woolieKICKDAD ExtraLife
[0:13:32] <Johannen> People dont have time to play from "METAL GEAR" onwards ^_^
[0:13:39] <leith_aziz> If I NEED to learn the lore to keep up, I'll do it for the chance of enjoying the plot
[0:13:41] <+frickenmoron> Welcome to Revachol, Snake
[0:13:42] <Prevot> imagine the cemetery scene with no context
[0:13:53] <leith_aziz> I wanna give it a fair shot
[0:13:56] <zeekayart> to be the very best that no one ever was
[0:14:01] <%the_Punktuation> the_Punktuation subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hi guys. I imagine for Making a ps4 port of PS5 exclusives developers are afraid of accidently making a Cyberpunk-like port to the PS4. I find that understandable, and why there's drought rn. I cannot imagine Rachet Rift Apart working at all on ps4.
[0:14:08] <BlackermanZX> dirty part skipper
[0:14:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> buy why would you do that
[0:14:09] <+ALazo> had a similar thing going with falcom trails games
[0:14:11] <leith_aziz> I made sure to watch Part 1 and 2
[0:14:12] <Prevot> dumbasses skip parts
[0:14:13] <%Juriasu> part skippers DansGame
[0:14:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> And skipping parts is fine :)
[0:14:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PART 2 IS RAD GUYS
[0:14:20] <leith_aziz> Also man, dont skip Part 2. Very good part
[0:14:21] <Afrosamasenpai> YOU CAN'T STOP US
[0:14:21] <zeekayart> i hate skipping parts my brain hurts lol
[0:14:22] <Prevot> filthy subhuman skip parts
[0:14:26] <linSP> I skipped 3 lmao
[0:14:27] <%Arnoldoaad1> in this house WE DONT SKIP PARTS
[0:14:28] <Eger007> I love Part 1 and I am not ashamed!
[0:14:29] <SSScholar> Koichi listen girls don't like people who skips parts
[0:14:33] <leith_aziz> You wanna skip out on Joseph?
[0:14:34] <Johannen> skipped Golden Wind, shit was goofy af
[0:14:34] <%jinking79> we were forced to skip part 1 and 2
[0:14:35] <Brandon__Brando> I just want to see stands
[0:14:36] <BlackermanZX> dont shake a part skipper's hand
[0:14:36] <dmtjinni> media dont matter that much
[0:14:37] <@Menitta> Also its entertainment and getting irrationally angry at that is dumb
[0:14:37] <%OblivionSword1> I blame glass reflection for part skipping
[0:14:38] <+TitanGigante> god Battle Tendency is so GOOD though
[0:14:43] <Prevot> if anything you should skip 3 LUL
[0:14:47] <notadeasterisk> Jojo?
[0:14:53] <zeekayart> i loooooove vampire dio he's a sexy man
[0:14:55] <%Lion_kun> Skip Part 8. It fucking sucks.
[0:14:55] <T_Sasquatch> video game sequels are hit or miss because the 1st one can be 20 years old and the new sequel is 2 years old
[0:14:55] <user_naim> I guess those losers don’t get to hear Overdrive
[0:14:56] <Brandon__Brando> I hate Harmon energy
[0:14:59] <@Menitta> I skipped most of part 3 tbh
[0:15:03] <guiltyboya> JJBA is for refined people
[0:15:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> Each part is a whole different genre, man.
[0:15:08] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> just start with SBR Kappa
[0:15:10] <%MrAtheGreat> Woolie, you greatly overestimate people's expecetations for getting earlier titles
[0:15:12] <%servicesuspension> IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS MAN
[0:15:14] <%jinking79> loving part 8
[0:15:15] <+Slimperton> Do not skip part 8. It's the best part.
[0:15:16] <DonatelloJose> I went 1, fell off because meh, started back at 4- 5- 2- 3. I regret nothing
[0:15:18] <JetpackMcQuack> just DIO things
[0:15:19] <user_naim> @menitta !
[0:15:19] <Indigo_Automaton> Parts of part 1 and 2 are a little slow
[0:15:23] <+drakthebest> Personally the only jojo part I actually liked was part 5, and I watched all of them
[0:15:23] <%Lion_kun> Jojolion is almost over and it's easily the worst part by far.
[0:15:31] <leith_aziz> We joke about GG lore, and as batshit crazy as it is, I do like the plot and characters a lot. Am I alone on that?
[0:15:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @guiltyboya *Sips Tea* quite so old chum
[0:15:39] <%eanscrale> A lot of people actually did start with SBR since it was the first one that was available in english.
[0:15:44] <%MrAtheGreat> hey if it's important they'll explain it in the sequal
[0:15:47] <+JustBlubs> The problem with Cyberpunk was just it having to be Cross Gen I feel
[0:15:50] <@Menitta> ratchet wouldnt really work on ps4
[0:15:51] <+JustBlubs> wasn't*
[0:15:51] <%the_Punktuation> Fair point.
[0:15:56] <leith_aziz> I think Part 3 is the one I like the least. The monster of the week formula doesnt work for me
[0:15:57] <guiltyboya> @Lion_kun but my gilf mezame potatoes, tho!
[0:15:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol imagine thinking cyberpunk flopped because it was made for ps4 in mind
[0:15:58] <RushUnplugged> R&C Rift Apart is also entirely funded by Sony to be a Ps5 promo, it basically sold nothing by default
[0:16:13] <@Solidus_113> Rift Apart is a SSD showcase
[0:16:22] <die_hardman> lmao cyberpunk didn’t work on the ps5 either
[0:16:33] <@Menitta> it did work on ps5
[0:16:34] <leith_aziz> Cyberpunk should have focused on 2 platforms only at the start
[0:16:35] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus wait, that was a cool mug. what is it?
[0:16:37] <@Menitta> but w/e
[0:16:39] <%kyh9> Tech Showcase
[0:16:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> And they are doing ONE port, the PS5
[0:16:40] <Brandon__Brando> cyberpunk just didnt work
[0:16:48] <%jinking79> got that full refund
[0:16:49] <+mechslayer71> just got the samsung s21 ultra, hoo boy I'm never going back to apple
[0:16:55] <+fetrigon> rachet and clank is a damn good system seller too
[0:16:57] <%servicesuspension> every gen has a few games to show off features no one else will ever use
[0:16:57] <zeekayart> i just don't care about the PS5 idk my PS4 still has games on it i need to play
[0:17:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> Porting games is hard and takes money.
[0:17:10] <die_hardman> @menitta not from the anecdotal footage I’ve seen. It works now tho, supposedly
[0:17:19] <Johannen> CD Project Red was lying thru thier teeth, thier promo videos always shown "Playstion gameplay" and never mentioned which one it was
[0:17:20] <zeekayart> i feel like you need a real good tv in order to appreciate the PS5 lolol
[0:17:21] <notadeasterisk> cyberpunk got spread between like 7 different systems
[0:17:22] <%kyh9> Like, I doubt Forbidden West or Ragnarok were designed explicitly to use an SSD, most games aren't really dependent on that sort of instant loading like Rift Apart is
[0:17:25] <%MrAtheGreat> cyberpunk was rushed and crunched and shot too widely.
[0:17:27] <Indigo_Automaton> I'm so sad with how Cyberpunk turned out. I was really looking forward to a AAA rpg in that setting :(
[0:17:33] <%servicesuspension> hand, market, yadda yadda
[0:17:38] <%MrAtheGreat> Keanu Reeves is sad
[0:17:40] <+Dreday543> Whats up Woolie, Reggie. How goes the stream?
[0:17:44] <%kyh9> People thinking PS5 exclusives are going to be anything but the same as what we got now but with faster loading
[0:18:01] <@Menitta> oh god my build is in the cart. I'm afraid of pulling the trigger
[0:18:02] <Lieutenant_Joe> I don’t remember hardly any loading screens in H:ZD
[0:18:05] <%Juriasu> og baby a triple PogChamp
[0:18:06] <DevilHands_> PogChamp
[0:18:07] <+fetrigon> I don't like discounts PunOko PunOko PunOko

[0:21:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYYEYE

[0:21:39] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:21:43] <die_hardman> ULTRALIBERAL
[0:21:44] <+drakthebest> No you don't it's just whatever is highest
[0:21:44] <%MrAtheGreat> Fascist is fun apparently
[0:21:45] <+Slimperton> I got the communist quest without internlizing any commie thoughts
[0:21:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> *LITERALLY* I LOVE IT
[0:21:48] <primaryfire> one of 4: communism, fascism, capitalism (ultraliberal) or centrism (moralism)
[0:21:49] <+drakthebest> I never picked one and got hte vision quest
[0:21:51] <%dds333a> A FAILURE of Rhetoric
[0:21:51] <%Vigonept> nah you found them all
[0:21:53] <T_Sasquatch> @X2Eliah aiyanyBonk
[0:21:53] <Prevot> pick one of these fascist or communist paths or fuck off
[0:21:56] <JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis options
[0:21:58] <guiltyboya> I went commie, didn't regret it
[0:22:00] <Miklosher> Fascist and Moralist are fun, the other two are dissapointing
[0:22:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> Mazovian is objectively the best
[0:22:06] <Lieutenant_Joe> I also went commie
[0:22:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BECOME FASCHIT SEE HOW BAD IT GET LUL
[0:22:08] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Yeah you don't get a "politics is good" choice because that would be stupid
[0:22:13] <+drakthebest> You DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE ONE INTERNALIZED
[0:22:14] <%MrAtheGreat> WAIT, WE GONNA DO THEM ALL
[0:22:14] <%servicesuspension> the moralist has worldbuilding, nationalist is the saddest, commie is a little of both and ultraliberal is funniest I hear
[0:22:15] <%Lion_kun> Which one is the one where you do the phone call?
[0:22:17] <notadeasterisk> please save before starting them
[0:22:17] <%MrAtheGreat> ??????
[0:22:18] <Miseryfell> you don't need one interalized
[0:22:18] <%hax_metatron> Go ultralib it's fun stuff
[0:22:20] <Lieutenant_Joe> I really enjoyed reading about infra-materialist theory
[0:22:24] <%krispen_wa> HUSTLE AND GRIND
[0:22:28] <%Vigonept> careful what you choose to forget, once you do its gone gone
[0:22:30] <Lieutenant_Joe> It was so dumb, I loved it
[0:22:32] <%Seancicle> sommes-nous
[0:22:33] <%krispen_wa> GO BEYOND, PLUS ULTRALIBERAL
[0:22:33] <Chatterbox1991> nationalism is a lot of fun
[0:22:34] <+airchrysalis> after the fash quest you say hm, measureheads not so bad
[0:22:35] <jorniev> DO MORALISM
[0:22:36] <Blank9> nationalism is hilarious and no one will ever see it in their playthrough
[0:22:40] <primaryfire> you might need multime days
[0:22:41] <+Sir_Louis> You've got a point
[0:22:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> Kingdom of Conscience is one, right?
[0:22:46] <%dds333a> I haven't done these, so this should be interesting
[0:22:46] <%X2Eliah> Do anything thats not communist because everyone picked communist already
[0:22:48] <DonatelloJose> Have we had the homosexual underground conversation yet
[0:22:50] <skyenoz> moralism is actually the most interesting in a lore perspective
[0:22:50] <%vaderxyz1970> Traditionalism woolie
[0:22:50] <DonatelloJose> ?
[0:22:53] <%Juriasu> they are all short right?
[0:22:55] <primaryfire> @DonatelloJose yeah last time
[0:22:55] <die_hardman> @cappuccinoguil objectively, I think moralist is the best. The ending is PogChamp
[0:22:57] <%krispen_wa> @donatellojose yes
[0:22:59] <%servicesuspension> moralism is good for lore
[0:22:59] <%X2Eliah> @DonatelloJose ye, last stream
[0:23:00] <+Vivaciousx3> i'd be interested to see moralism
[0:23:01] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can sit on the bench before you go to sleep for a hwile
[0:23:02] <+projectmanatees> communism sucks
[0:23:03] <%eanscrale> You can apparently internalize all of them, not sure how that works out though.
[0:23:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> @die_hardman extra XP tho
[0:23:04] <+Sir_Louis> you can internalise one now
[0:23:08] <%chandlerofearth> i hear the moralism one is p cool and plot relevant
[0:23:09] <DonatelloJose> Thanks guys! I'll watch the anime
[0:23:09] <%MrAtheGreat> @WoolieVersus you can cheese out hours rapidfly by reading books
[0:23:09] <JetpackMcQuack> Sit and think about facism for an hour or two
[0:23:09] <Miseryfell> you don't need any internalized
[0:23:10] <user_naim> bout to be a long, political day
[0:23:13] <+mczarklesby> I think moralism fits the playthrough tbh
[0:23:18] <tattleworm> if it comes to it, i can talk you through editing the save file to decrease the time it takes to internalise a thought @WoolieVersus
[0:23:20] <Esparsenior> Honestly ….. ALL of them re really good. Ultra liberal is probably the weakest but it’s still good
[0:23:20] <%bread_assassin> Literally anything but communism, Woolie.
[0:23:21] <%Vigonept> commie tho
[0:23:25] <Eger007> ULTRALIBERAL
[0:23:26] <Lieutenant_Joe> Go with what you want, Woolie. They’re all great,
[0:23:33] <+drakthebest> I did it without being internalized
[0:23:33] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus put it to a vote?
[0:23:35] <%X2Eliah> Safer to do internalization
[0:23:36] <%Juriasu> internalize to be safe imo
[0:23:36] <+drakthebest> It's just whatever is highest
[0:23:37] <%MrAtheGreat> Choose the one that suits you
[0:23:38] <%Seancicle> 🤞🏻❔
[0:23:39] <+Sir_Louis> leaning into one is still worth it
[0:23:43] <notadeasterisk> I did
[0:23:46] <+whoami777> moralism fits the playthrough. woolie is trying to be a reasonable person aka coward
[0:23:47] <guiltyboya> communism is real fun, in a very leftie and "remember the worst of USSR" kind of way
[0:23:50] <Prevot> LUL
[0:23:50] <T_Sasquatch> some say kos, some say kosm
[0:23:52] <die_hardman> INTERNALIZE ONE AAH

[0:23:55] <BlackermanZX> go full commie
[0:23:55] <nukle0nik> none of them are correct from the perspective of HBD
[0:23:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> I don't think you can vote on thoughts LUL
[0:23:56] <Lieutenant_Joe> The game is better if you do internalize one
[0:23:56] <%Juriasu> but the commune Woolie
[0:24:04] <%diegobandzz> You don’t know
[0:24:05] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE IS BOURGEOIS SCUM
[0:24:10] <%Vigonept> THE GLORY OF THE COMMUNE
[0:24:13] <JetpackMcQuack> No right answers here
[0:24:14] <DrStinkers> Democracy isn't one of the ideologies
[0:24:16] <%alpharius88> woolie is 1000% the one he picks
[0:24:17] <%servicesuspension> the fucking wiki is so barren

[0:51:59] <Lefteron> kinkok1Smile
[0:52:01] <%kyh9> Rustic is a scam to get people to pay more for shittier places
[0:52:05] <aiutare47> I grew up "rustic", its cheap, its simple, its because thats the bare minimum you need to survive
[0:52:06] <jorniev> oh you mean that wall style
[0:52:22] <dukenux> Honestly depends on material used
[0:52:23] <%derpy_platypus> level 7 dumpster
[0:52:25] <drunken_lemur> Reject Modernity, Embrace Tradition
[0:52:30] <%derap41> Turns out all humans desire is transience
[0:52:32] <+allups> i like it
[0:52:40] <%kyh9> Rustic is what Landlords tell you to convince you to pay $3000 for an unfinished factory apartment
[0:52:40] <%X2Eliah> Give it 40 years, four white walls (or a shitty wallpaper) will be the new age rustic
[0:52:43] <Indigo_Automaton> POCKETS
[0:53:00] <%heysamuel> that's a look

[0:53:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> E3 uniform
[0:53:05] <+Jeshk0> wow i dont remember ever getting this jacket
[0:53:05] <%derap41> Its so ugly it almost looks good
[0:53:07] <aiutare47> oh wait woolie isnt wearing the tie
[0:53:08] <gunsrlove> People in the old country don't get your First World bullshit "iT's RusTIc" Kappa
[0:53:11] <dukenux> Herlock Sholmes ass looking jacket
[0:53:11] <tattleworm> look at this fuckin hipster
[0:53:13] <%X2Eliah> That is art
[0:53:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> not with that t-shirt OR the pants
[0:53:14] <Chatterbox1991> you look like a game develuper
[0:53:19] <%X2Eliah> That is art cop
[0:53:21] <%hax_metatron> But the teacher that sells you weed
[0:53:26] <%Juriasu> it has the same pattern as reggies shirt LUL
[0:53:36] <dukenux> so hipster, youd blend perfectly with a brick wall Kappa
[0:53:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> blazer and a t-shirt like Phil Spencer
[0:53:39] <+airchrysalis> kevin smith ass
[0:53:46] <%servicesuspension> the drug hands
[0:53:47] <aiutare47> the tie has special dialogue Woolie, without it on you wont get it
[0:53:49] <keviniscool> damn for a police officer you commit a lot of crimes against fashion in this game
[0:53:55] <linSP> When the teacher smells like weed but has tenure
[0:53:57] <elshadow7> Poor Horrific Necktie, so neglected...
[0:53:59] <%OblivionSword1> chat it's too late for the tie
[0:54:03] <+dalmek> @aiutare47 too late for that
[0:54:09] <aiutare47> Theres still some notable dialogue no?
[0:54:11] <muXPerience> Did a half light bad end playthrough, it was great
[0:54:11] <+mechslayer71> 2 authority NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:54:12] <%X2Eliah> @aiutare47 he failed the 1st check in game, tie is forever silent on woolie
[0:54:14] <+Slimperton> High half-light is super fun but its probably too late to pump it now
[0:54:15] <Johannen> Too low of a score to come up
[0:54:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @aiutare47 tie never started to begin with, it won't do anything at this point
[0:54:18] <aiutare47> ohhhhhhh shit
[0:54:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> But it comes up rarely BECAUSE your half light is low
[0:54:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:14:12] <%alpharius88> phone line internet sounds
[1:14:12] <foxname96> @woolieversus my 4 year old nephews don't know what a CD is. They used to streaming direct content
[1:14:13] <aiutare47> People give way too little credit to kids, my nephews no all that shit from tv
[1:14:14] <%servicesuspension> from Bendy and the Ink Machine I guess
[1:14:22] <%aogman> the call is coming from inside the house

[1:14:25] <+NocturnePsycho> its more under 12
[1:14:25] <+mczarklesby> How many of them would know what a phone hook was?!
[1:14:26] <DSD24> Is this the same thing like Floppy discs?
[1:14:29] <%servicesuspension> I dunno, kids seem to like twentieth centry stuff sometimes

[1:14:50] <Johannen> Did Woolie had a Television with a remote?

[1:15:13] <heemwizard> oh wow
[1:15:17] <%AugiJr> Really isnt a better symbol for saving
[1:15:33] <$ArCielArDor> I didn't have a remote till my teens

[1:22:04] <guiltyboya> TRUE
[1:22:08] <heemwizard> street food is tax free baby
[1:22:10] <@Solidus_113> kebabs are like jerky, really expensive and not enough food
[1:22:14] <RyuuAoi> Cone to ThaiKota!

[1:22:37] <heemwizard> @soundcloud_raptor that isnt capitalism lol
[1:22:41] <muXPerience> of course you have to be approved by the Oyabun if you want to start doing business
[1:22:44] <BerryliciousDefinition> This sounds like a Yakuza substory

[1:22:53] <zanzibarian_hamster> The more I hear about Canada the more fucking mobbed up it starts to sound
[1:22:55] <T_Sasquatch> but to be fair, letting just anyone sell food on the street can lead to bad shit
[1:22:56] <%Vigonept> fhats hustle woolie
[1:23:00] <RyuuAoi> Sounds like PRIVILEGE
[1:23:04] <exnuart> why is montreal so corrupt
[1:23:18] <Johannen> They are looking for the Cocaine Skull O_o
[1:23:19] <DSD24> That's the point I feel
[1:23:20] <+pupil31> LUL
[1:23:20] <iacus_> I mean it is capitalism in the sense that the ones that already have the money are curtailing competition against their interests
[1:23:22] <%X2Eliah> Man, down with the regulation, let everyone use gutter oil
[1:23:22] <wibbwobbler> A startup sounds pretty rough
[1:23:22] <%krispen_wa> I never got what that was supposed to imply?
[1:23:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> Shivers and Inland

[1:24:04] <+Jeshk0> shivers provides the aura of information, but never anything straight

[2:10:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Not the science pants
[2:10:08] <Miklosher> Heal up a bit I say
[2:10:10] <%LCLSmoothie> superstar cop btw
[2:10:11] <%servicesuspension> is it tho
[2:10:15] <%Takreth> heal to restore volition
[2:10:17] <Indigo_Automaton> Back to the ice
[2:10:29] <%servicesuspension> oh right, damage also hurts your skills
[2:10:29] <iacus_> healing ahead of time is only necessary for rolls
[2:10:29] <theyseemerowling> It does affect volition though, so heal up
[2:10:42] <+Sir_Louis> Low health means low volition
[2:10:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> debuffs tho
[2:10:44] <%servicesuspension> vol and end get nerfed
[2:10:47] <dukenux> this somehow felt worse than body disection
[2:10:48] <Indigo_Automaton> But your endurance stat is lowered for checks
[2:10:49] <Miklosher> but lower volition and endurance for checks tho...
[2:10:49] <%MrAtheGreat> It's almost bed time chill chat
[2:10:50] <ingman112> Don't forget that volition will be lower
[2:10:55] <+PMAvers> Although being way low *does* give you a massive stat penalty.
[2:10:56] <skyenoz> but it damages the stat

[2:11:09] <die_hardman> YOUR VOLITION IS LOW @woolieversus
[2:11:09] <%Irridium> I mean it's how I played
[2:11:10] <%SomeAsianDood> Volition checks are the only time he'll need to buff it up
[2:11:18] <Narbarec> People who whined at Woolie not to heal up are dum dum liars
[2:11:26] <Frostilk> passive checks should still be ok, no?
[2:11:26] <Chogex> not like volition checks are raining from the sky
[2:11:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> @SomeAsianDood Volition has a lot of good passive checks
[2:11:45] <iacus_> not healing is the best tactical choice for 99% of the game
[2:11:54] <%SomeAsianDood> Fair, but if he doesn't want to listen to volition hes fine @ReallyBigRocks

[2:29:53] <%derap41> Death by misadventure is a good way to say it
[2:30:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> only sometimes though
[2:30:09] <iacus_> committed misadventure
[2:30:15] <+Fedhas> logic quoting freud, huh
[2:30:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> misadventure sounds grander than it is
[2:30:27] <dukenux> yea
[2:30:29] <+Jiggisnipe> yea...
[2:30:32] <%X2Eliah> kinda
[2:30:38] <meatman_noplan> Its incredibly unfortunate
[2:30:40] <spaceitaly> the ice water might have sobered him up just enough to swim to shore
[2:30:41] <ingman112> He might have frozen to death then
[2:30:42] <%derap41> Just shit happening
[2:30:43] <%X2Eliah> just a bad fall
[2:30:44] <%servicesuspension> yup, might have awakened the ol half-light
[2:30:45] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe both are 50/50
[2:30:45] <Picia000123> it's a freak accident yeah
[2:30:46] <Indigo_Automaton> While drunk? The shock from the cold water would sieze you up and you'd drown
[2:30:49] <treblesom> its an amazing fun
[2:30:51] <DianaTheAscian> might have just froze to death but maybe
[2:30:56] <JetpackMcQuack> Tear it all down
[2:31:00] <MinersLoveGames> Slipped through the boards and hit his head against the bench. It's always scary how something so simple can be lights out forever.
[2:31:01] <linSP> Accident!
[2:31:18] <%X2Eliah> @Indigo_Automaton or get washed ashore, depending on current
[2:31:25] <%livlinn> woolieACCIDENT woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:31:39] <Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton Or taken by an undertow
[2:31:59] <dukenux> Kim would preffer the report
[2:32:03] <%OblivionSword1> he would at least has a chance to be alive if he fell in the waterr
[2:32:05] <dukenux> wouldn't he?
[2:32:09] <%derap41> 4 is the worst ever
[2:32:14] <%derap41> just leaving him there
[2:32:21] <ingman112> You also don't know either of their names, so that's the identification part
[2:32:23] <a_bald_bro> i found him before i ever talked to her
[2:32:26] <UndeadManatee> thats what i had to do
[2:32:33] <MinersLoveGames> @Indigo_Automaton Boardwalks are usually built in the shallowwer parts of water. If he fell through, he might have been able to just stand up and wade back to shore.
[2:32:59] <JetpackMcQuack> check his throat for bullets
[2:33:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:43:29] <%derap41> @skyenoz tbf so was most of Japan for their atrocities
[2:43:32] <ingman112> Maybe ditch that ledger for now
[2:43:36] <%servicesuspension> polo probably means something different

[2:43:50] <%servicesuspension> don't let Cuno see you
[2:43:59] <DianaTheAscian> as a treat

[2:44:12] <+dalmek> yep
[2:44:19] <Miklosher> are you going to abandond coach physical instrument
[2:44:20] <ingman112> Rhetoric is high enough though
[2:44:20] <+dalmek> now water polo? I don't know anything about that
[2:44:20] <%servicesuspension> polo is just a lame version of waterpolo
[2:44:22] <ingman112> Empathy needs a boost
[2:44:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> BOOTS ON, SHOW YOUR AUTHORITY SwiftRage
[2:44:35] <DianaTheAscian> wait water polo?
[2:44:36] <%derap41> yep and its not even the cool Arabian polo where they fight each other on horseback
[2:44:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> doesn't the tank top boost PI without tanking authority?
[2:44:41] <%servicesuspension> you have enough pieces for a human being disguise
[2:44:59] <%derap41> Polo with a dead goat is best polo
[2:45:06] <tequi1asunset> Has that anything to do with Marco Polo?
[2:45:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Put the crowbar on?
[2:45:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> Crowbar shows openable crates
[2:45:31] <%X2Eliah> crowbar or flashlight
[2:45:36] <ingman112> I'd actually bring the ledger back now to counteract the empathy drop
[2:45:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> drop a fat hit of LSD
[2:45:51] <%diegobandzz> @woolieversus you saw bill Cosby is gonna be released?
[2:46:20] <huskarl_zap> wait

[2:46:23] <ingman112> Empathy looking rough
[2:46:24] <+Jeshk0> hes already out
[2:46:32] <Miklosher> maybe composure / pain threshold?
[2:46:35] <%MrAtheGreat> concept will give you gains
[2:46:40] <Fuji808> Might as well sit on the point.
[2:46:40] <huskarl_zap> 2 composure LUL
[2:46:46] <Project205> random question, has woolies read the case files in the ledger?
[2:46:52] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus hand eye coordination would benefit you a LOT

[2:46:55] <+icekept> why'd they let him out
[2:46:56] <asdief_> inland?
[2:46:57] <ingman112> He has a thought for it
[2:46:59] <%servicesuspension> every 2 points gets you more passives, I think
[2:47:01] <%derap41> @Project205 yeah he's done all of the ledger

[3:13:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> they are below blanka players
[3:13:54] <Deasmeister> He was great in rumble in the bronx the fact that his foot was broken and everything
[3:14:01] <meatman_noplan> True true, yeah.
[3:14:04] <zanzibarian_hamster> @die_hardman that Taekwando guy though, fuuuuck
[3:14:15] <zhenthrim213> @CaptainPileDriver how dare you
[3:14:22] <%derap41> The 70s near 80s stuff that started the karate craze in the US

[3:15:07] <%derap41> Its martial Arts
[3:15:16] <Asperger_Mode> top MMA fighters do it and swear by it for some reason
[3:15:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:15:27] <%derap41> not Martial Practical's
[3:15:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> @zhenthrim213 fair enough, i'd shake a blanka players hand, i would refuse to even sit next to a ram player
[3:15:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> I KNOW THAT DUDE
[3:15:38] <Seraphim9> xu xiaodong!
[3:15:38] <WakeUpThrow> "kinda"
[3:15:39] <StaticEntry> he exposes frauds
[3:15:46] <%SirGO0SE> thats an anime waiting to happen
[3:15:47] <Pt_Kamen> Zero Social Credit
[3:15:49] <%krispen_wa> the eyepatch wolf video essay
[3:15:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> that dude kicks the shit out of chinese masters and china doesn't like it
[3:15:51] <meatman_noplan> That poor guy has more or less had his entire life destroyed.
[3:15:55] <iacus_> those masters are fraud fighters though
[3:15:58] <%SirGO0SE> oh THOSE videos
[3:15:59] <%SomeAsianDood> wait why would you shake hands with a blanka player? That's like touching jellyfish skins
[3:16:01] <%SirGO0SE> those are frauds for sure though
[3:16:02] <%diegobandzz> Fighting masters n washing them
[3:16:03] <%illusiveSaint> I've seen that doc it's upsetting
[3:16:04] <user_naim> You mean the guy who had his whole life ruined, lost his gym and all
[3:16:05] <StaticEntry> He calls out ancient chinese master bullshit
[3:16:11] <iacus_> the mma dude is amateur level, even
[3:16:11] <+mechslayer71> and the dude isn't even good. he's past his prime and fat. he's just competent and that's WAY more than enough
[3:16:12] <%SirGO0SE> the kind of martial arts that are closer to cults
[3:16:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's been ostracized by everyone and everything
[3:16:20] <%derap41> Martial arts is like dancing its performative first
[3:16:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's been kicked out of his own dojo/gym
[3:16:24] <%kyh9> I cheer for it. Down with this superstitious martial arts nonsense
[3:16:34] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus seen the news about the 7-year old kid taking Judo classes in taiwan? he died from getting judoslammed 27 times by the school's teacher. So all these martial arts svchools atrent that great.
[3:16:39] <%fentry> basically everyone in martial arts before like the turn of the century was a grifter
[3:16:41] <die_hardman> @user_naim pretty much. Martial arts are great for exercise and discipline, but not for a straight fight :(
[3:16:42] <%derap41> The State went after him
[3:16:44] <%diegobandzz> They made him wear clown makeup
[3:16:46] <iacus_> well, in fighting skill beats athleticism 90% of the time. But he's not even that pro at martial arts
[3:16:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> he has to wear chinese clown makeup to fight masters
[3:16:53] <%SirGO0SE> that is a very blanket statement that is not true in a lot of cases @derap41
[3:17:08] <%illusiveSaint> he says that real Chinese martial art culture is dead and exposes how the govt exploits it
[3:17:11] <%SirGO0SE> and for anyone serious about learning training theyll do the research so it isnt true at all
[3:17:12] <%servicesuspension> just get a taser
[3:17:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> they force him to literally dress up as a clown and they hate that he keeps beating the shit out of the "masters"
[3:17:26] <+NopeBadguy> chinese government does a hell of a job with propaganda
[3:17:29] <StaticEntry> The state doesnt like the mythos being messed with
[3:17:30] <user_naim> @x2eliah that guy didn’t even have a license right? Just an ex cop that kept throwing the kid after he threw up
[3:17:31] <die_hardman> @servicesuspension just get a gun. Depending on your country
[3:17:39] <%diegobandzz> Don’t forget they make him find his own way to these fights
[3:17:40] <+mechslayer71> it's not even learning other things, most of those rigid pattern based martial arts in China are just straight bullshit
[3:17:45] <%alpharius88> it's is over?
[3:17:49] <+justianxix> what do you need to search on YouTube?
[3:17:52] <%X2Eliah> @user_naim something like that, yeah.
[3:17:52] <MinersLoveGames> @NopeBadguy I personally take any information that comes out of China with a grain of salt.
[3:17:54] <+toastybites> its super complicated
[3:17:56] <pi_in_the_sci> There's also the Chinese Nationalism, with the government just promoting bullshit
[3:17:57] <%derap41> @SirGO0SE I'm not saying you can't hurt people but its performative for the most part
[3:18:01] <Pt_Kamen> it's for Social Credit Score
[3:18:09] <Deasmeister> He has too low social credit to use the bus right?
[3:18:09] <%derap41> His social credit score is negative
[3:18:09] <%servicesuspension> @die_hardman that's why I said taser, gun's difficult to get in some places, also not very safe if you are ... in a bad place
[3:18:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> he got kicked out of THE GYM HE TAUGHT AT for over 10+ years
[3:18:15] <WakeUpThrow> I still think the clown make-up kind of backfired. Like, your martial arts grandmasters are getting their ass whooped by a clown
[3:18:16] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE and the good martial arts are NOT about hurting people LUL
[3:18:26] <meatman_noplan> Right on
[3:18:32] <%krispen_wa> Japanese Priest men who know Bajiquan are pretty dangerous though
[3:18:37] <JetpackMcQuack> MMMonks
[3:18:45] <dukenux> It's an emergency excersize
[3:18:47] <+NopeBadguy> good guy shaolin
[3:18:57] <+NopeBadguy> is it shaolin or xiaolin?
[3:18:57] <meatman_noplan> I would've kicked your ass but you were flexing your toe and that's the only reason you won.
[3:19:01] <die_hardman> @servicesuspension agreed. Self defense is super messy
[3:19:06] <%servicesuspension> turns out movies were a lie
[3:19:06] <dukenux> If he has approval of the fucking Xiaolin
[3:19:11] <%diegobandzz> Didn’t it start because the government wanted to teach ancient martial arts as self defense in schools?
[3:19:14] <%SirGO0SE> the first thing any good fighting style will teach you is how to get out of situations without hurting people
[3:19:15] <%illusiveSaint> there is real martial arts but it's been watered down and bastardized so much for entertainment in China
[3:19:21] <justcallmebobplease> @meatman_noplan No, his tongue was in the wrong position, that's it - no wait, it WAS the toe thing, it was - justification continues]
[3:19:23] <meatman_noplan> @illusiveSaint That's a part of it too, yes.
[3:19:23] <Robot_Nixon_> -takes notes-
[3:19:23] <%SirGO0SE> including yourself
[3:19:28] <+PMAvers> They're willing to do the time in training mode to figure out the new tech instead of wanting to just ban it.
[3:19:35] <srv4254> monks love new fighting tech
[3:19:46] <%derap41> @NopeBadguy Western spelling varies
[3:19:50] <dukenux> i mean movie martial arts were always exagerrated and thats not a aecret
[3:19:55] <%kyh9> 52 Blocks!
[3:19:58] <%derap41> the 80s Karate craze
[3:20:08] <%townzzzzz> got to have some ego in da fighting games
[3:20:09] <Deasmeister> They go to the fighting game dojo and lab it
[3:20:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> back in the 70's
[3:20:16] <%servicesuspension> About to demistify martial arts when suddenly... TOTSUGEKI!
[3:20:19] <%krispen_wa> That sounds sick
[3:20:22] <%X2Eliah> The 80s were 40 years ago

[3:34:06] <aiutare47> Take this thoughts man. It keeps on giving.
[3:34:18] <%mariothemaio> time to sacrifice a thought
[3:34:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so so worth it
[3:34:20] <primaryfire> it's not very good tbh
[3:34:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not worth it
[3:34:23] <DianaTheAscian> I don't think so
[3:34:24] <%Vigonept> Hes a legend!
[3:34:25] <%derap41> So this was all thanks to Encyclopedia
[3:34:28] <%heysamuel> honestly yeah it's not worth it
[3:34:32] <+Vivaciousx3> shit compressor isn't good
[3:34:32] <laserbeaming> it's not great, but it's a fun thought
[3:34:35] <+Sir_Louis> yeah it's not that good
[3:34:36] <DianaTheAscian> its to reset white checks I think
[3:34:38] <candidateplays> no points
[3:34:42] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Volumetric Shit Compression isn't useful any more
[3:34:45] <%Vigonept> go talk to him then
[3:34:48] <%servicesuspension> you don't do much with superstar
[3:34:50] <%hax_metatron> There's no more use to having that thought
[3:34:50] <aiutare47> It pops up with unique dialogue all the way to the end of the game if I remember correctly
[3:34:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> All it's for is discovering Kim is part of the underground
[3:34:56] <%hax_metatron> You can discard that thought
[3:34:56] <%illusiveSaint> it just gives you dialogue
[3:35:00] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus dump volumetric
[3:35:02] <%OblivionSword1> volumetric is not that useful anymore
[3:35:04] <primaryfire> don't need to internalise the thought for the dialogues
[3:35:09] <%hax_metatron> You discovered that Kim is gay, you can get rid of the thought
[3:35:09] <diddlerriddler> just checking in to make sure woolie knows that time stops after 2am, and you get infinite time to retry white checks, explore, read case files
[3:35:15] <%fentry> shit compressor is mainly to help with getting the body down
[3:35:16] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus If you are not planning on pumping Endurance anymore you can forget Compressor
[3:35:18] <+Vivaciousx3> its for getting the body down
[3:35:18] <%krispen_wa> it unlocked it once
[3:35:20] <%derap41> Its a 1 time thing
[3:35:25] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's a one time thing
[3:35:25] <%X2Eliah> one time unlock
[3:35:26] <%hax_metatron> It's a 1 time thing
[3:35:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> unlocks once at the time of completion
[3:35:29] <%Irridium> they reset I think
[3:35:30] <%hax_metatron> You can discard it
[3:35:30] <%OblivionSword1> unlocked when you get the thought it's a one time thing
[3:35:30] <%X2Eliah> already passed
[3:35:36] <heemwizard> discard homosexual underground
[3:35:38] <%derap41> and makes taking the corpse guaranteed
[3:35:53] <%OblivionSword1> it's just for the corpse
[3:36:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @derap41 no not guaranteed
[3:36:13] <Johannen> Forgeting that thought will remove the ability to put any more points into Endurance
[3:36:17] <%derap41> @derap41 Don't you get like +10 or something
[3:36:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @derap41 idk but you can still fail

[4:28:01] <%OblivionSword1> fortunately it's white
[4:28:02] <meatman_noplan> White, so popping a level into logic opens it again.
[4:28:03] <Josef_Stryker> I think we're all agreed that we should just let Reggie do like all the rolls from now on?

[4:28:29] <ingman112> One of those things you can wait on and come back to
[4:28:30] <penitentpendant> For what it's worth, proceeding with this storyline will unlock this check again

[4:28:41] <+Fedhas> i wonder if acele will open the check up again, no idea tho
[4:28:41] <%servicesuspension> let reggie roll the next one
[4:28:42] <%illusiveSaint> explore the church and come back
[4:28:43] <ainda_> you wouldn't take a 13% chance of getting shot

[5:07:23] <Hoanui> Sad core is probably just shoegaze
[5:07:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> it's an alternative rock style, apparnetly

[5:09:03] <%kewlmyc> Kim: "WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING IN THERE?"
[5:09:06] <+MightyDuckShoes> Authority is heavily reliant on the clothes. More so than other stats. Authority is super reliant on other's perception
