[0:11:07] <Alzero83> a Fresh setup can be worlds different as you may now
[0:11:08] <%BlueJoneleth> It's weird when Reggie appears half on the left
[0:11:08] <@Solidus_113> In the middle of the Broken Bond LP
[0:11:09] <OfficerMods> very weird
[0:11:10] <%BlueJoneleth> lol
[0:11:12] <%Livelinne> we'll get use to it woolieSMUG
[0:11:13] <%ekodrop> might be a bit too zoomed in, might kill visual gags
[0:11:13] <%Dirtamus01> double mint looking ass
[0:11:17] <%IzazaOzihaha> @odd_slater Catsuit or labcoat?
[0:11:18] <Harro8> Itll be fine if its flipped...
[0:11:19] <+zaitje> the woolie camera does seem brighter than the reggie cam
[0:11:19] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! Since you're rapidly closing in on the ending, are you going to rewatch some of the earlier LP parts over again once it's done to just see how your theories/perspective changed over time?
[0:11:19] <aiwass8> Good luck figuring it out
[0:11:20] <+paladinstarbuster> Morimura has less "art" than baby chihiro and thats sad
[0:11:20] <+chiazam> I remember that
[0:11:20] <%kewlmyc> It's cool, just flip the camera feeds so you're not looking in the opposite directions when looking at each other.
[0:11:29] <brachydios777> Also I have beaten Yakuza 0, kiwami, and I am currently playing Kiwami 2. Fantastic games
[0:11:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Just flip cams and I'm fine
[0:11:34] <%Amaideus> Man I can't find "art" for this at all
[0:11:35] <OfficerMods> just flip
[0:11:36] <%RyTYoung> CHANGE IS GREAT
[0:11:38] <%Amaideus> Big disappoint
[0:11:38] <%SkellyVee> waoFufufu waoFufufu
[0:11:38] <Harro8> Even if we get used to it doesn't mean it isn't weird...

[0:11:42] <jorniev> JUST FOLLOW THE THIRDS RULE
[0:11:43] <X2Eliah> Yeah no actually it's just the camera flip thing

[0:11:56] <odd_slater> @izazaozihaha Both but I prefer catsuit especially her aiming that phaser all the time lmaoo
[0:11:59] <Alzero83> I have a Question for Reggie: Megumi or Miwako, Who do you choose? @WoolieVersus
[0:12:04] <%ZweihanderSteve> but its not from our perspective. makes sense
[0:12:06] <@akuda_bar> but are you looking at you or are we looking at you tho
[0:12:11] <jorniev> reggie keeps looking at me
[0:12:12] <%IzazaOzihaha> Honestly, this looks better to me.

[4:30:20] <%doombawkzvs> :O
[4:30:26] <Takfloyd> gonna go expert mode for the remaining battles? they seem to have gotten too easy on normal
[4:30:26] <dohrge> SeemsGood
[4:30:30] <FancyRamenTV> @WoolieVersus Much Love! I for one am appreciating someone running through this with as little spoilers as possible.
[4:30:30] <%Livelinne> NotLikeThis = Ryoko
[4:30:30] <%mousesorcerer> <3 <3 <3
[4:30:31] <SomersaultJustice> did they talk about this week's gifg yet?
[4:30:36] <%SkellyVee> stalalaHeart stalalaHeart stalalaHeart
[4:30:36] <reonome> i like facecams
[4:30:40] <heartlesshealer> it's cool
[4:30:40] <+paladinstarbuster> ITS FINE WOOLIE
[4:30:43] <%AyotoCorp> Can my computer from Artesian Builds run Mighty Kaiju Deimos
[4:30:45] <+animatedartiist> Proper Ryoko My head emote when
[4:30:46] <mgotacon> It does look great.
[4:30:49] <%feign___> it worked fine in practice
[4:30:49] <%d1stantutopia> The expert shill
[4:30:52] <OblivionSword1> might want to mirror it
[4:30:57] <Arancet> i kinda miss the couch view, but this is fine, but bit hard if you have 3 or more people
[4:30:58] <Harro8> It's better flipped for the audience but do whatever you want
[4:30:59] <%SkellyVee> ryoko emote omg
[4:30:59] <Victory_Boss> mirror woolie cam, so when you look at Reggie you look at him
[4:31:04] <%CreggaMonsta> yea mirror it
[4:31:04] <heartlesshealer> mics from center is a good display look
[4:31:07] <Blank9> the only part that's weird is if you both get up at the same time and merge into one another
[4:31:09] <%cvp5127> what happens for 3 ppl LUL
[4:31:11] <+vaderxyz1970> What if you have more than 2 people?
[4:31:15] <%mousesorcerer> LUL
[4:31:15] <%feign___> was weird at first but it wasn't an issue
[4:31:18] <rosemon5001> whats the background sound?
[4:31:19] <CaptainBright> Woolie, how does it feel to know that 13 sentinels is just Reboot in SPACE
[4:31:24] <%Seancicle> ‚úåüèªcontexte manque
[4:31:25] <+StryderStrikesAt> Should do a final episode that‚Äôs just watching all the scenes in chronological order
[4:31:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> they want it mirrored cuz of their OCD @WoolieVersus so troll em
[4:31:28] <X2Eliah> Yeahexcept youre always pointing to the opposite side
[4:31:30] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[4:31:31] <+JacknZack27> Its kinda weird in full screen, but I didn‚Äôt care when it was in the corner
[4:31:31] <Harro8> Pretty much
[4:31:32] <$Spydurman> YES
[4:31:33] <SomersaultJustice> just set up a 3rd camera in the bathroom
[4:31:33] <%cvp5127> yes flip it
[4:31:34] <Lancaster_H> yes woolie, it's fucking weird
[4:31:34] <Harro8> Head turning
[4:31:35] <+zaitje> Yes
[4:31:36] <%WutangchickeN> @WoolieVersus crop reggie and yourself down about 15% in the window when the stream is up, his head's getting cut off by the angle of the game window frame
[4:31:38] <%ZweihanderSteve> it should be mirrored so it's more conducive to the viewer seeing you
[4:31:40] <heartlesshealer> probably only for head turning
[4:31:40] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL LUL
[4:31:41] <%wibbwobbler> yes
[4:31:41] <%SkellyVee> looool
[4:31:41] <reonome> maybe put woolie on the right
[4:31:44] <+devilishleader> yes
[4:31:46] <%CreggaMonsta> its kinda both
[4:31:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it will take some getting used to, but mostly the headturn
[4:31:48] <%Irridium> pretty much yeah
[4:31:48] <AnneSQF> yes, it's the headturn
[4:31:49] <+RowenCleric> yea its just the head turning thats kinda jarring
[4:31:49] <%cvp5127> yes
[4:31:49] <Harro8> Just the head turning
[4:31:52] <Blank9> just the head turn
[4:31:52] <%Livelinne> tbh I miss the Kirby lamp woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:31:53] <%Irridium> also that
[4:31:53] <$Spydurman> head turn
[4:31:54] <+zaitje> just head turn
[4:31:55] <X2Eliah> Yes
[4:31:55] <pjbuster> woolie just be p1
[4:31:56] <Arancet> its the head turn
[4:31:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the head turn
[4:31:57] <%za7az> yes
[4:31:58] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I dunno. I feel like I'd have to see if both ways to compare
[4:31:58] <el_biribon> the head turning
[4:31:58] <heartlesshealer> It is the head turning
[4:31:59] <DedlokPM> I think it is fine
[4:31:59] <+MetroidPrimeRib> it's the head turn
[4:32:01] <X2Eliah> No its the head turn
[4:32:02] <CaptainBright> I too miss that Kirby
[4:32:03] <OblivionSword1> it's the headt urn
[4:32:05] <%za7az> head turn
[4:32:07] <%mousesorcerer> PrideShrug
[4:32:08] <%d1stantutopia> Good guy Reggie
[4:32:08] <+NYCrownlessKing> talk to reggie right now woolie and tell me if u like that
[4:32:12] <%SkellyVee> totCry
[4:32:13] <rReizs> just turn away to talk LUL
[4:32:13] <%cvp5127> LUL
[4:32:16] <OblivionSword1> it looks weird
[4:32:16] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:32:17] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[4:32:17] <AnneSQF> sorry
[4:32:17] <aiwass8> Mind goblins, just a head turn
[4:32:19] <X2Eliah> WOOLIE ITS THE HEAD TURN
[4:32:20] <+animatedartiist> Turn
[4:32:23] <%d1stantutopia> Honestly it's the head turn but it's not a big deal
[4:32:23] <+NYCrownlessKing> just turn away to talk coward Kappa
[4:32:23] <mgotacon> Still either way, looks good.
[4:32:25] <rosemon5001> background bgm?
[4:32:25] <X2Eliah> AND ARM POINTING
[4:32:26] <reonome> why not woolie on the right?
[4:32:30] <Fefe41> Just pretend and turn the other way
[4:32:30] <+RowenCleric> cant you just swap them? or is it harder than that
[4:32:30] <X2Eliah> AND BODY SHIFTING
[4:32:31] <%AyotoCorp> Back to back might also give more room to move stuff around
[4:32:32] <heartlesshealer> this is fine, just gotta train yourselves on keeping eyes camera-proper
[4:32:33] <X2Eliah> AND ALL THAT
[4:32:35] <%SilverDevilfish> From our POV it looks like Reggie is looking for you in chat whenever he turns his head
[4:32:36] <Lancaster_H> YES
[4:32:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:32:38] <$Spydurman> yes
[4:32:39] <pjbuster> It really isn't
[4:32:40] <+animatedartiist> Yes
[4:32:40] <%Livelinne> nah
[4:32:41] <OblivionSword1> maybe try mirroring it but keep the same side if you can
[4:32:41] <%cvp5127> or just swap seats LUL
[4:32:41] <mgotacon> As mirroring would mess with text on shirts ect. So6 of one half a dozen of the other.
[4:32:42] <%wibbwobbler> no
[4:32:42] <DedlokPM> It is not a big deal
[4:32:43] <el_biribon> not a big deal but it does look weird
[4:32:43] <+vaderxyz1970> Who's watching the stream you or us
[4:32:44] <+jiggy_snipe> it's goofy dude
[4:32:44] <+MetroidPrimeRib> mind goblins
[4:32:46] <X2Eliah> YEWS
[4:32:46] <Harro8> Everyone is saying that dude
[4:32:46] <rosemon5001> yo say fuck it and put yourself SIDE WAYS
[4:32:47] <%Irridium> no but goblin brain demands it
[4:32:48] <+DinnerCalzone> What if you invert just one of the camera displays so that you both are looking the same direction when you look at eachother
[4:32:53] <rReizs> this really is the manga stream
[4:32:53] <stevenellis386> do your thing woolie
[4:32:53] <X2Eliah> Everyone is saying it
[4:32:55] <Harro8> If you don't want to JUST SAY SO
[4:32:55] <+zaitje> Yes woolie it is
[4:32:55] <%Livelinne> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:32:57] <reonome> don't think that matter tbh
[4:32:58] <+jiggy_snipe> but Japan tho Kappa
[4:33:00] <%d1stantutopia> NOT A BIG DEAL
[4:33:00] <Blank9> but we're the manga
[4:33:01] <%za7az> psaBig deal
[4:33:06] <%ZweihanderSteve> wrong mirroring
[4:33:06] <X2Eliah> wtf
[4:33:07] <%cvp5127> reverse woolie
[4:33:09] <+MetroidPrimeRib> isnt this the manga though
[4:33:10] <Lancaster_H> Woolie just put Reggie on portside
[4:33:11] <KaiserMario> It will be better for Reggie's head not to be under the layout
[4:33:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no not mirror
[4:33:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> just SWAP the camera positions lol
[4:33:15] <SomersaultJustice> guess you'll have to buy inverted shirts
[4:33:15] <Arancet> cant swap which side youre on without mirroring?
[4:33:15] <%SilverDevilfish> Sv Eiloow
[4:33:16] <stevenellis386> don't worry about it bro
[4:33:20] <+mauricefaurron> Woolie pls swap em
[4:33:22] <xbb1024> Woolie wants to be first
[4:33:23] <X2Eliah> No ude just swap the camera positions
[4:33:24] <+Nephitamine> swap seats?
[4:33:25] <+NYCrownlessKing> dont flip it, just reverse where the camera's are
[4:33:27] <%CreggaMonsta> he dosent want to swap
[4:33:33] <%cvp5127> swap seats
[4:33:33] <pjbuster> I think it looks fine
[4:33:36] <RyuuAoi> Big deal
[4:33:37] <heartlesshealer> woolie on the P1 side makes sense for channel name
[4:33:38] <+animatedartiist> lol woolie wants to be player 1
[4:33:45] <+NYCrownlessKing> woolie i bet if you switched to reggie's seat and tried it. you'd hate it Kappa
[4:33:48] <$Spydurman> flip it, twist it and reverse it. Lemme see you twerk it
[4:33:48] <SomersaultJustice> woolie hates luigi confirmed
[4:33:51] <rReizs> go top down
[4:33:52] <OblivionSword1> well just try things out and see if it looks good
[4:33:52] <AnneSQF> live OBS tinkering is the best!
[4:33:53] <%IzazaOzihaha> I'm reminded by nationwide Karens asking for cropping fixes on their students.
[4:33:54] <%cvp5127> breaks everything
[4:34:11] <pjbuster> when is it's reggie versus reggie is on the left
[4:34:13] <EndgameContent> That wouldn't even fix the problem
[4:34:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> i mean it just for a test reggie just to see if what he see's on streams makes him annoyed.
[4:34:16] <mgotacon> Yeah, mizing deck ect.
[4:34:17] <rosemon5001> put it sideways to mess whit everyone
[4:34:20] <mgotacon> mixing*
[4:34:20] <RyuuAoi> What talk show puts guest on the right!?
[4:34:21] <+animatedartiist> That will mess up ass groves
[4:34:22] <el_biribon> woolie vs chat mind goblins
[4:34:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @X2Eliah
[4:34:28] <ven_neet> chat is wrong, everything looks fine woolie
[4:34:36] <X2Eliah> Oh for godssakes
[4:34:40] <RyuuAoi> Change seats!
[4:34:41] <%AyotoCorp> Change cameras so Woolie's on the right and Reggie's in Pat's dungeon
[4:34:42] <heartlesshealer> Just put whoever's got controller on the left display and keep it that way
[4:34:44] <%jinking79> they got 2hour ppl
[4:34:45] <mgotacon> I didn't notice till chat pointed it out tbh.
[4:34:47] <X2Eliah> its literally just swapping where the camera picture is in the overlay
[4:34:54] <%CreggaMonsta> honeslty Reggie looks like he host in that seat
[4:34:55] <rReizs> imperfect diagonal cut just like a manga page
[4:34:58] <+RowenCleric> Reggie why are you the greatest?
[4:34:59] <pjbuster> reggie why do you like feet?
[4:35:08] <RyuuAoi> WOOLIE SHOULD BE ON RIGHT
[4:35:10] <Harro8> Just swap the overlays...
[4:35:12] <el_biribon> reggie no
[4:35:12] <%kewlmyc> LUL
[4:35:13] <mgotacon> Good title...
[4:35:15] <%astrofizzix> Woolie, as a "math guy" I'm going to crunch some numbers to see if you could actually determine that the planet's mass is different than Earth's.
[4:35:15] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Do the swap and look at the game layout, I bet it won't cut your head too because of how you're sitting
[4:35:19] <+jiggy_snipe> ask the devs lol
[4:35:20] <heartlesshealer> Oh Reggie doesn't know LUL
[4:35:22] <%dangitJM> People in chat have no rights and no dignity.
[4:35:27] <%IzazaOzihaha> It'll make sense.
[4:35:28] <%d1stantutopia> https://clips.twitch.tv/DeadExcitedPlumberMVGame
[4:35:33] <%d1stantutopia> https://clips.twitch.tv/OptimisticInventiveMilkDatBoi
[4:35:37] <mgotacon> Change is scary.
[4:35:48] <Blank9> woolie and reggie should be staring longingly into each other's eyes
[4:35:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1348891911097110529?s=19
[4:35:49] <%WutangchickeN> Greenscreen Woolie into Reggies Eyes and Mouth
[4:35:50] <%d1stantutopia> The only reason to switch would be the head turning, but it's not a big deal.
[4:35:51] <%CreggaMonsta> talks shows have guest on the left in dfense
[4:35:52] <+Mundkipz> Isn't Woolie's right our left?
[4:35:52] <mgotacon> Lol
[4:35:53] <X2Eliah> Woolie for godssakes its the head turn
[4:35:55] <Harro8> No he's saying it because the headswitch would make sense then
[4:35:57] <reonome> maybe swap your seating positions?
[4:35:58] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie should be on the right cuz this is the manga. Right to left reading Kappa
[4:35:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie should be on the right because of the head tilt, gotta be specific
[4:36:00] <%wibbwobbler> DIFFERENT
[4:36:00] <+JacknZack27> I didnt even notice they were on different sides
[4:36:00] <X2Eliah> how many hundred times do we need to say it
[4:36:04] <$Spydurman> the head turn away from each other feels weird
[4:36:10] <%dangitJM> who's "we"?
[4:36:13] <Lancaster_H> woolie for fucks sake both of you looking outside the camera borders to look at each other looks weird this aint that hard to understand
[4:36:13] <heartlesshealer> controller person in the P1 slot works, the only problem is "look at each other" habits
[4:36:14] <%kewlmyc> You turning to look at Reggie makes it so that you're looking offscreen for us. We can get used to it, just just a weird decidsion.
[4:36:15] <+NYCrownlessKing> woolie if reggie was floating above you, would you put his camera position below you? Kappa
[4:36:16] <Harro8> If you're on the right the head turn would make sense
[4:36:17] <Kulix76> In yugioh the winner is always on the right so reggie wins
[4:36:21] <%IzazaOzihaha> QoL taking this from a 5 to a 9
[4:36:28] <mgotacon> My sides are in orbit atm.
[4:36:28] <xbb1024> Get that tech that digitally makes it look like you have eye contact all the time
[4:36:31] <rosemon5001> what about upside down? LUL dicLit
[4:36:31] <AnneSQF> at least it not several hours of audio mixing
[4:36:41] <$CrowbarFacelift> Enhance
[4:36:43] <pjbuster> LUL
[4:36:43] <%doombawkzvs> Perfect

[4:37:18] <+dr1ove> PokGengar
[4:37:21] <RyuuAoi> YES
[4:37:23] <X2Eliah> Seems about right
[4:37:24] <EndgameContent> Where it's just completely distorted
[4:37:25] <$CrowbarFacelift> SeemsGood
[4:37:30] <%doombawkzvs> WOAH

[4:37:52] <%Livelinne> yoo nice screen
[4:37:53] <X2Eliah> Eeeeeeyyyy
[4:37:58] <%feign___> *ding*
[4:38:01] <rReizs> imagine an anime standoff with a split screen but the people talking are on the other side of where they are supposed to be
[4:38:04] <el_biribon> hair preserved
[4:38:05] <%za7az> @kapcommunist We need this as a t-shirt :)
[4:38:12] <SomersaultJustice> you need that fro clearance range
[4:38:14] <RyuuAoi> Brady Bunch dat bitch!
[4:38:15] <rosemon5001> hair saved

[4:38:19] <OblivionSword1> hair stays in frame
[4:38:30] <+paladinstarbuster> kirby
[4:38:31] <el_biribon> kirby in frame
[4:38:32] <$Spydurman> too much
[4:38:32] <dundunsun> Feature the hair
[4:38:38] <$Spydurman> VS needs to be in frame
[4:38:39] <Harro8> NOW SWAP SEATS LUL
[4:38:45] <RyuuAoi> Gotta keep the fro
[4:38:47] <BlackermanZX> eeyy kirby
[4:38:56] <OblivionSword1> woolie is a bit offcenter
[4:38:59] <%cvp5127> Kreygasm
[4:39:01] <OblivionSword1> there we go
[4:39:02] <+jiggy_snipe> good
[4:39:03] <%feign___> I like this less.
[4:39:04] <%Klefth> That looks good
[4:39:07] <+Kyma1020> Much Better
[4:39:07] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[4:39:09] <X2Eliah> Aight. That's super good now
[4:39:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about it don't you like
[4:39:10] <+NYCrownlessKing> now LOOK at eachother
[4:39:12] <%d1stantutopia> LUL
[4:39:12] <KaiserMario> Keep Woolie at the left corner so his head doesn't clip on the layout
[4:39:13] <SomersaultJustice> woolie is patting right now
[4:39:13] <heartlesshealer> lighting weirdness
[4:39:13] <%sodamin1> y e a h
[4:39:13] <$Spydurman> much better
[4:39:15] <+mauricefaurron> Woolie for fuck's sake LUL
[4:39:17] <%WutangchickeN> tell us to fuck off
[4:39:18] <reonome> i love it
[4:39:19] <X2Eliah> wtf
[4:39:19] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> No. This is wrong
[4:39:19] <xbb1024> lens flare
[4:39:19] <%sodamin1> m u c h b e t t e r
[4:39:20] <%doombawkzvs> Why is the lighting always making Woolie like the blazing hero we all need, and Reggie look like the anti-hero who submitted to darkness to save those he wanted to protect
[4:39:20] <%bread_assassin> It looks weird now, because Woolie is looking away from Reggie.
[4:39:20] <+zaitje> So much better
[4:39:20] <Lancaster_H> its literally the same but better
[4:39:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> BUT TALK TO EACHOTHER
[4:39:23] <$CrowbarFacelift> Can you mirror yourselves?
[4:39:23] <dundunsun> News network style
[4:39:24] <+jiggy_snipe> now look at each other
[4:39:26] <stevenellis386> do you woolie
[4:39:26] <+animatedartiist> its the bg perspective lmao
[4:39:28] <AnneSQF> yea, that IS weird :S
[4:39:28] <$Spydurman> change is hard Woolie, you'll get use to it LUL
[4:39:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> ur gonna flip ur shoulders to talk to him tho
[4:39:29] <BlackermanZX> looks weird LUL
[4:39:30] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus I also liked it better the other way
[4:39:30] <Harro8> It's because of your camera position
[4:39:31] <+paladinstarbuster> BACK TO BACK
[4:39:32] <RyuuAoi> THIS IS WOOLIE VS
[4:39:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> look at each other
[4:39:36] <%Klefth> LUL
[4:39:36] <%sodamin1> change is hard woolie
[4:39:36] <heartlesshealer> Looks like Guarding
[4:39:37] <Harro8> But it's fine
[4:39:37] <%kewlmyc> Look at each other
[4:39:38] <%feign___> woolie is angled in a weird way, the way it was makes more sense except when looking at each other
[4:39:38] <X2Eliah> jesus christ
[4:39:40] <%sodamin1> you'll get used to it
[4:39:41] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:39:41] <ardbart> Nah, This is wierd
[4:39:43] <pjbuster> But you are back to back cool guys though
[4:39:43] <SomersaultJustice> it takes two
[4:39:45] <%illtima> Keep it like that but mirror individual screens?
[4:39:46] <X2Eliah> Reggie is literally looking at you
[4:39:46] <Lancaster_H> You turn to each other to talk to constantly woolie @WoolieVersus
[4:39:46] <reonome> why not move the camera
[4:39:48] <odd_slater> BALLS TO BALLS
[4:39:48] <TreeLeafBoi> IT'S ASS
[4:39:48] <%doombawkzvs> The lighting behind reggie on the right side hurts my eyes
[4:39:48] <el_biribon> Woolie make the left camera face you and the right one face reggie
[4:39:48] <+jiggy_snipe> manga tho
[4:39:49] <BlackermanZX> this is weird
[4:39:50] <%d1stantutopia> You look like P1 and P2 character select.
[4:39:50] <%CreggaMonsta> both ways aren't perfect to be honestr
[4:39:51] <$CrowbarFacelift> now kith
[4:39:51] <+mauricefaurron> yeah but when you look at each other it's perfect
[4:39:52] <+zaitje> But it looks like you and reggie are making a pose
[4:39:55] <%wibbwobbler> hrrmmm
[4:39:57] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Go back
[4:39:59] <RyuuAoi> This is the WAY
[4:40:02] <%jinking79> Now It looks like your behind Reggie now
[4:40:03] <OblivionSword1> ah ok I see the problem
[4:40:04] <%feign___> you spendore time looking at the game than each other
[4:40:05] <Blank9> yeah other way was better
[4:40:08] <rosemon5001> when camera location is more important than the games smh
[4:40:09] <AnneSQF> go back
[4:40:09] <+paladinstarbuster> "you'll get used to it"
[4:40:13] <%d1stantutopia> Side note, loving the beard Woolie, looks good.
[4:40:13] <OblivionSword1> now I see the problem
[4:40:13] <%astrofizzix> Yeah, I liked it better the other way
[4:40:14] <+PkSilent01> Go back the other way is better
[4:40:14] <younou24> I'm with you there woolie
[4:40:14] <mgotacon> Either way, up to you man. Follow the cinematographer within you.
[4:40:15] <heartlesshealer> the double angle has lighting problems
[4:40:15] <%doombawkzvs> I dont like it
[4:40:15] <%feign___> spend more*
[4:40:16] <%sodamin1> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[4:40:16] <X2Eliah> Ok, how about not crossing the camera views?
[4:40:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok well at least you gave it a shot
[4:40:16] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL
[4:40:17] <Victory_Boss> vetoed
[4:40:20] <Harro8> It's because of your camera placement
[4:40:20] <%CreggaMonsta> Reggie is just too charismatic,
[4:40:22] <+JacknZack27> I dont see the problem but whatever
[4:40:22] <%doombawkzvs> This does not spark joy
[4:40:23] <reonome> i like it BibleThump
[4:40:25] <ManlyMcBeefington> I like it
[4:40:27] <+MetroidPrimeRib> troubleshooting is good
[4:40:27] <SomersaultJustice> what we can see is you are a coward
[4:40:28] <el_biribon> swap camera placements
[4:40:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> woolie you're having like fighting game OCD where you want the characters facing eachother in classic games, but it's cooler with you two facing away and actually able to look at eachother when talking
[4:40:30] <%cvp5127> looks fine
[4:40:30] <+animatedartiist> @paladinstarbuster lool
[4:40:30] <AnneSQF> we must learn to trust Woolie
[4:40:31] <BlackermanZX> fuck it go back doodBait
[4:40:31] <%feign___> yeah, the other way is better
[4:40:32] <Mikey2dope> You do you Woolie
[4:40:32] <SomersaultJustice> Kappa
[4:40:32] <%Livelinne> Kirby lamp! PridePog
[4:40:32] <$CrowbarFacelift> Yup
[4:40:33] <+mauricefaurron> I like it :)
[4:40:33] <pjbuster> tbh reggie is better on both sides
[4:40:34] <Lancaster_H> it really isnt weird, you're being weird
[4:40:37] <TreeLeafBoi> go back
[4:40:37] <+dr1ove> you'll get used to it
[4:40:37] <KaiserMario> Meh, they're both fine imo
[4:40:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> its not weird, its better lol
[4:40:38] <Arancet> disagree, i see your points but prrefer this, but your choice
[4:40:39] <+DWAC379> nah the only thing that matters is you look at each other
[4:40:41] <heartlesshealer> yeah, go back to earlier idea
[4:40:44] <Harro8> Move your cameras off stream
[4:40:49] <OblivionSword1> yeah ok I can see it being weird
[4:40:49] <sketchpixels> Woolie back to the origimal setup (the one you like) but switch the camera on the stream only
[4:40:51] <+justianxix> live Gov Corruption
[4:40:51] <rReizs> just look away from each other when talking LUL
[4:40:51] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @heartlesshealer
[4:40:52] <X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Why are your cameras crossing diagonally?
[4:40:52] <%kewlmyc> I just expected you to take the same camera feed but swap them on the overlay. You do you.
[4:40:53] <%SkellyVee> lol
[4:40:55] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe
[4:40:57] <heartlesshealer> sorry Moobot
[4:41:01] <gfbagel> just flip the images with software
[4:41:02] <%AyotoCorp> Put one camera upside down and then stack the views vertically
[4:41:02] <+NYCrownlessKing> just have reg
[4:41:02] <%Livelinne> shiaLUL
[4:41:08] <%Kriss1827> just ignore chat ez
[4:41:10] <+Mundkipz> put a mirror on either side so you can turn to a reflection!!!
[4:41:11] <%sodamin1> just only have reggie on screen
[4:41:12] <$Spydurman> you'll get comments on the head turn every stream from everyone unaware of the setup
[4:41:13] <RyuuAoi> 2021 is WEIRD WOOLIE
[4:41:14] <%sodamin1> obviously the bet
[4:41:15] <Harro8> He's actually right tho
[4:41:16] <BlackermanZX> Or go back like usual camera LUL
[4:41:16] <+RowenCleric> it honestly doesnt matter, we watching the game when you are playing anyways
[4:41:16] <%Irridium> what if you flipped one of you upside-down
[4:41:18] <Harro8> Just do it offstream
[4:41:19] <%doombawkzvs> Get reggie a vtuber avatar and then you can just sell the cameras
[4:41:19] <%CreggaMonsta> put Reggie on both sides
[4:41:23] <%Livelinne> woolieSPICE woolieVS woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY

[4:41:30] <SomersaultJustice> what if you throw a filter on it
[4:41:30] <DedlokPM> @gfbagel then the shirt text and the woolieVS will be backwards
[4:41:32] <Project205> fair enough
[4:41:33] <KaiserMario> Top and Bottom?
[4:41:36] <+b_aleph> put Reggie on both sides!
[4:41:38] <X2Eliah> fair

[4:42:32] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[4:42:32] <SomersaultJustice> I'm waiting for the camera to fall down and break
[4:42:32] <Lancaster_H> why is reggies hand cel-shaded
[4:42:33] <%jinking79> watch this be the reason y the GGLore videos gets delayed
[4:42:33] <%Livelinne> joofbWave
[4:42:34] <BlackermanZX> also the light on the back looks weird
[4:42:36] <pjbuster> I hope woolie clips all of this and puts it on the youtube channel
[4:42:37] <%feign___> the D hand
[4:42:37] <%ChoculaUltra> make a dog head with your hand Reggie!

[4:43:26] <mgotacon> Reggie in Heat mode rn.
[4:43:27] <%Livelinne> woolieKICKDAD woolieSPICE
[4:43:29] <pjbuster> big woolie
[4:43:29] <$Spydurman> Angel Reggie
[4:43:30] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie looks absolutely incandescent rn
[4:43:32] <+b_aleph> cool cool cool
[4:43:35] <%mousesorcerer> LUL
[4:43:37] <heartlesshealer> even bigger light problem
[4:43:42] <+b_aleph> now frame reggie in both cams
[4:43:44] <reonome> the head turn is better though
[4:43:45] <Harro8> at this point just do whatever you want
[4:43:46] <+DWAC379> nah its perfect
[4:43:47] <%za7az> Looks really zoomed in
[4:43:48] <+mauricefaurron> no it's not
[4:43:48] <heartlesshealer> Go original config
[4:43:48] <BlackermanZX> nah screw it
[4:43:53] <Lancaster_H> woolie literally the only issue is the head turn
[4:43:56] <Lancaster_H> nothing else
[4:43:59] <el_biribon> tbf all of these are better than the old setup
[4:44:00] <BlackermanZX> og was better
[4:44:00] <heartlesshealer> what you did during today stream was perfect
[4:44:00] <+jiggy_snipe> the cops are coming soon
[4:44:00] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus I liked it best the 1st way
[4:44:01] <RyuuAoi> Woolie WILL figure it out
[4:44:02] <%sodamin1> put reggie in both cameras, he deserves it
[4:44:03] <%wibbwobbler> this is it
[4:44:10] <el_biribon> old one was too zoomed out
[4:44:11] <reonome> DOUBLE WOOLIE
[4:44:13] <KaiserMario> Gold Reggie and Silver Woolie
[4:44:13] <Harro8> No
[4:44:16] <sketchpixels> THIS IS HORIBLE
[4:44:16] <rReizs> just buy mechsuit pilot pods with custom cameras
[4:44:20] <aiwass8> Oh well
[4:44:20] <$Spydurman> no
[4:44:22] <+b_aleph> DOUBLE REGGIE LETS GO
[4:44:24] <+RowenCleric> we can hear the helicopters and drones in the distance
[4:44:29] <RyuuAoi> Now its worser!
[4:44:30] <masterfire23> you can keep it the first way and mirror the cameras
[4:44:33] <Takfloyd> first way was the best, but ideally you want it to be so you look at eachother on the screen when you do in real life
[4:44:33] <SomersaultJustice> just sit naked in robots with your own cameras pointing at you
[4:44:35] <Victory_Boss> two-face camera setup, half woolie half Reggie
[4:44:40] <alrobot2014> we gotta go before reggie has to put on the fursuit to get extra time to run from the curfew cops LUL
[4:44:44] <%astrofizzix> The lesson from this is, like always, to ignore chat.
[4:44:48] <+animatedartiist> Pure content this is great way better than anime
[4:44:54] <Arancet> yoou guys still got curfew?
[4:44:56] <heartlesshealer> the problem with mirror is shirt logos and the VS emblem
[4:44:58] <RyuuAoi> I like 2nd gig
[4:44:59] <Lancaster_H> just wear go-pros at this rate and look at each other while talking
[4:44:59] <+mauricefaurron> nah this one is the best it's just kinda scuffed because of light and focal lengths
[4:45:07] <%Livelinne> just do couch shot at chatting time, and switch to close up when gaming
[4:45:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i wonder if this will be in the anime as a bonus
[4:45:16] <%sodamin1> this is more fun than the gameplay
[4:45:19] <%sodamin1> lol
[4:45:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck thanks for reminding me
[4:45:35] <%Klefth> Grossly incandescent Reg

[4:45:45] <%feign___> I liked the way the lighting looked on woolie there best but yeah, the first way was best for everything else except the turn
[4:45:47] <%sodamin1> THERE HE IS
[4:45:47] <reonome> katamari
[4:45:48] <mgotacon> It was great tho.
[4:45:50] <Harro8> THE PRINCE

[4:46:41] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Hey I know you're done with this conversation, but what do you think of having two separate cameras on the layout? With you on the left and Reggie on the right ends of the screen? Too much?
[4:46:43] <BlackermanZX> Reggie and half Reg
[4:46:44] <Lancaster_H> WOOLIE IS GONE
[4:46:44] <+RowenCleric> YES this is what we were asking for
