[0:18:20] <Nekros4442> @akuda_bar It'd be Keqing or Female Traveler if anyone unfortunately
[0:18:22] <%ggbhtg> A Fate character will get into a fighting game, and Pat WILL be forced to watch Fate

[0:19:10] <andrewofbob> Robin Hood betrayed the poor
[0:19:19] <MyNameIsRasus> FUCKED AROUND AND FOUND OUT
[0:19:21] <%kyh9> HOW DO YOU SHORT MORE THAN EXISTS?!
[0:19:21] <@akuda_bar> leopards ate my face
[0:19:22] <%ggbhtg> "But ME didn't do it, how dare THEY!!!"
[0:19:25] <haisho> I'm a genius....OH NO!
[0:19:26] <%cvp5127> but think of the billonaires :(
[0:19:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ggbhtg as a guy who don't play fighting games, I really want there to be a Fate fighting game with 40 characters
[0:19:29] <%wibbwobbler> kinda rulez
[0:19:37] <haisho> Big LONG pause
[0:19:37] <CaptainBright> Gods, the Chris Cuomo interview with the CEO of Robinhood was OOOFFFF
[0:19:57] <%wardogleader15> Looking forward to hopefully the 13 Sentinel Final. Excited tp be here for it.
[0:20:00] <%ggbhtg> @Th3SmartAlec Well, if DFO has one.....
[0:20:05] <brachydios777> Don’t spend your entire bank, please!
[0:20:06] <%ChoculaUltra> the CEO of RH looks like such a fucking tool bag. Cuomo shat on the kid.
[0:20:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ggbhtg DTF you mean?
[0:20:21] <+Jaromero435> The dude straight up said on TV he wanted to protect themselves
[0:20:22] <2bnieroperator69z> ceo of robinhood in trouble
[0:20:29] <%ZweihanderSteve> "this is an attack on the wealthy"
[0:20:39] <%kyh9> Cyberpunk is thousands of people screaming about a line on a screen and screaming at each other to put more faith in the line
[0:20:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @zweihandersteve oh nooooooo
[0:20:40] <EndgameContent> The camera setup here is nice, feels really conversational.
[0:20:50] <Nekros4442> They got the media telling straight up lies lol
[0:20:53] <+loukemia83> Robinhood Ceo was trying to protect his customers. However his customer is Citron and trading companies, not the users
[0:20:54] <haisho> speaking of something relevant, I can't believe I heard my brother go in the direction of "Not All Hedge Fund Managers"
[0:20:56] <alrobot2014> Pretend?
[0:20:57] <%ChoculaUltra> that's why I'm afraid for DeepFuckingValue :( These rich assholes will stop at nothing to keep the bag open
[0:21:05] <@akuda_bar> what's the most you ever lost on a coin toss
[0:21:08] <andrewofbob> Not invest it in some stock market gamble?
[0:21:08] <Harro8> You mean 10 billion?
[0:21:16] <%Mrbaconator> they absolutely would
[0:21:19] <%wibbwobbler> cry on camera
[0:21:28] <%cvp5127> if they could they would
[0:21:29] <%ChoculaUltra> and he just showed his face in that recent WSJ interview too :(
[0:21:29] <brachydios777> Sociopaths run the stock market
[0:21:33] <+moink1234> i just got here and woolie is already talking about murder
[0:21:35] <MyNameIsRasus> dress like an ace attorney character
[0:21:41] <%cvp5127> isnt it 70 billion?
[0:21:45] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus How many of these billionaires do you think just have a legitimate Hoarder problem?
[0:21:48] <brachydios777> 70 billion
[0:21:55] <Nekros4442> All I know is I aint selling till I get an offer for 3k per stock
[0:21:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:21:56] <+loukemia83> *so far
[0:21:57] <%kyh9> My favorite quote from the WSB guys: “WE CAN REMAIN STUPID LONGER THAN THEY COULD REMAIN SOLVENT”
[0:22:01] <Blank9> how do you spend a billion dollars though
[0:22:05] <%ChoculaUltra> like what tf do you even do with that much money
[0:22:12] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus How many of these billionaires do you think just have a legitimate Hoarder problem?.
[0:22:16] <brunoberserk> YOU DIDN'T WIN x11
[0:22:27] <%kyh9> WHY WOULD THEY SHORT MORE STOCK THAN EXISTED
[0:22:27] <%ChoculaUltra> its not like these billionaires are doing anything cool with either - I'd be building mecha kaiju to fight in some stupid mecha kaiju theme park
[0:22:34] <brachydios777> I imagine investing now isn’t the most stable plan
[0:22:42] <%SouLucha> And then we eat the rich.
[0:22:43] <%ThisIsLloyd> laterSlime
[0:22:50] <+Jaromero435> too bad WE WILL NEVER SELL
[0:22:55] <+Razor4145> hold the line @WoolieVersus

[0:25:05] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus How many of these billionaires do you think just have a legitimate Hoarder problem?
[0:25:07] <lucky_icarus> Blazblue use to be that
[0:25:07] <Qu1ckyyy> Wasn't Persona 4 arena somewhat like that?
[0:25:11] <Arancet> but gotta make damn sure story is good enough to be worth its own seperate section
[0:25:15] <Takfloyd> Sonic Battle was a fighting game/VN combination with many interconnected character stories... silly example but it's there
[0:25:16] <%ChoculaUltra> there's also a brightside to jumping into the AMC game rn - people are gonna want to go to the movies when this covid shit is over with
[0:25:24] <Equirah> @funny2allways they'll still be getting money from the settlements cause there's already several violations by several trading apps, it's just cheaper for the hedgefunds to pay whatever they're fined with than what they owe at this point
[0:25:24] <brachydios777> I never thought r/wallstreetbets would be the ones saying “The revolution will be televised”
