[0:20:09] <+ExceedSC> It's easy, make workers, don't get supply blocked, by making depots/overlords/pylons, make more production to spend money
[0:20:10] <dds333a> Please Understand ThankEgg
[0:20:13] <%alpharius88> ok why there is kerringan(zerg) marine and another zerg where is the protos?
[0:20:13] <+jayayanami> no, no, no. the frames or lack thereof adds to the aesthetic.

[0:23:03] <leith_aziz> Jesus, the new Castle Super Beast video came out and the comment section is fucking depressing. I get not liking it, but the reaction is redicillous. You might not like some changes, but people are harping on it like it's a trash heap of a game. It's actually scaring off newcomers who liked it cause of the negativity.

[1:39:27] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:39:32] <FullMetalSnorlax> I didn't imagine this game's multiplayer would be taking turns
[1:39:54] <crimsonsaens> Only 1 challenge per floor actually
[1:40:14] <someyounguy1> @FullMetalSnorlax its less like turns and more like team switching. everyones always playing, just not for the same team
[1:40:20] <MrPandastic> @FullMetalSnorlax Yup, but you only get your turn IF your goood enough.
[1:40:44] <JetpackMcQuack> fire bad
[1:40:53] <+GenesisKnight> Fire indeed hot

[1:41:27] <someyounguy1> minh definitely already had the same thing
[1:41:35] <bevyrage> minh just bought the roll he already had, and didn't pick up any of his loot
[1:41:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:41:36] <Louie_Salmon> Mm
[1:41:41] <crimsonsaens> It would be stupid, wouldn't it
[1:41:41] <%d1stantutopia> bought the advanced roll to replace the advanced roll
[1:41:54] <+OblivionSword1> no time to read
[1:42:00] <crimsonsaens> Look at it this way, it denies the others from getting advanced roll
[1:42:01] <WG101> THE GRAPPLER RETURNS
[1:42:28] <bevyrage> everyone already has advanced roll though?
[1:42:33] <pacibuddy> the dokage is here
[1:42:49] <dubstep_paladin> DO COMBO
[1:43:05] <crimsonsaens> Someone has the magic bow shot
[1:43:24] <Louie_Salmon> Was that a bonfire just now
[1:43:34] <crimsonsaens> Yeah, that was a bonfire
[1:44:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Do combo
[1:44:32] <%d1stantutopia> It really bothers me that they all keep messing up on the mimics
[1:44:43] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:44:47] <%d1stantutopia> Just charging at them with their slow movement instead of being an ambush predator
[1:44:50] <Louie_Salmon> Shoulda read that ring
[1:44:58] <crimsonsaens> He can't see the healing either
[1:45:06] <bevyrage> minh not noticing the guy dropping healing orbs
[1:45:10] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:45:13] <bevyrage> oh god right
[1:45:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> yeyeye i love crawl
[1:45:40] <slix3431> Throwin hands
[1:45:49] <crimsonsaens> This game might be the most disadvantaged Minh has ever had
[1:45:54] <%d1stantutopia> >taking the portal when the shop door is RIGHT THERE
[1:45:56] <%d1stantutopia> AHHHHHHH
[1:46:36] <Hydrapissed> LOl
[1:46:43] <MrPandastic> PFFFFFFT
[1:46:51] <Louie_Salmon> Buying both of those potions would be a strict upgrade lol
[1:47:26] <%d1stantutopia> @Louie_Salmon Yeah, buying multiple potions is always a good strat as long as you keep the stat increases roughly equal
[1:47:29] <crimsonsaens> Potions are always positive stat bonuses
[1:47:44] <dds333a> hmmmmmm
[1:48:08] <WG101> ALL AT LEVEL 10
[1:48:42] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL

[1:48:56] <%d1stantutopia> This game IS cool
[1:48:59] <%Josef_Stryker> So what kind of game is this?
[1:49:16] <+chiazam> Is this the return of Salt Party?
[1:49:31] <+GearheadGoof> It's basically like a PvP roguelike where the other players control the monsters
[1:49:32] <dds333a> Co-op dungeon crawler, somewhat
[1:49:33] <crimsonsaens> It's a party game, but it's pretty fun solo too as an arcadey dungeon crawler
[1:49:33] <%d1stantutopia> @Josef_Stryker roguelite dungeon crawling betrayal sim
[1:49:40] <IzanagiNoOokami> Check how hard I can pee.
[1:49:40] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I see woolie does the same ghost start i do LUL
[1:49:42] <%Josef_Stryker> So are they taking turns?
[1:49:46] <Hydrapissed> PvP roguelite
[1:49:48] <dds333a> @chiazam sure is
[1:49:50] <%Josef_Stryker> Seeing how gets farthest?
[1:49:52] <%Josef_Stryker> *who
[1:50:05] <+GearheadGoof> Whenever you kill the hero you get to play as them, they're trying to beat the boss first
[1:50:09] <%hologram_sam> givm the shimmy
[1:50:11] <Hydrapissed> all playing same time to either kill each other or the guy alive fights the final boss
[1:50:12] <dds333a> That, and who wins, since there is a definite end
[1:50:27] <%Josef_Stryker> I see
[1:50:32] <dds333a> More easily reachable, at least, end
[1:50:49] <%Josef_Stryker> Is this a PC game or is it on consoles too?
[1:50:56] <Hydrapissed> consoles and pc yeh

[1:51:13] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH LUL
[1:51:22] <crimsonsaens> I love how many of the monsters are designed to be as annoying as possible
[1:51:51] <Louie_Salmon> Wh- b- literally every stat go up
[1:52:42] <crimsonsaens> It does take some getting used to the systems in this game, especially since there's pressure to keep the pace high
[1:52:53] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[1:53:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Woah, we're back to a full couch. That's hype

[1:53:48] <+xerotwo> ONE SHALL BE THE DOKAGE

[1:54:07] <%perfectsalami> if woolie looses the other two win
[1:54:18] <Equirah> Nope LUL
[1:54:21] <crimsonsaens> I hope Woolie loses so they can see the consequences

[1:55:17] <WG101> OH THAT'S WHAT IT IS

[1:55:47] <%hologram_sam> I love this ol gamey ass game
[1:55:49] <%d1stantutopia> And character stats like total kills and wins and whatnot carry over until they die
[1:56:00] <+ripperdip> Depression
[1:56:01] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Damn. My friends couldn't keep interest long enough in this game for us to make it to the final boss
[1:56:05] <crimsonsaens> It's keeps your win counts, until you're consumed
[1:56:08] <FullMetalSnorlax> play zerg soccer :P
[1:56:10] <%andrewofbob> So, it's a bit of a Yoko Taro roguelike?
[1:56:22] <raikagelord1> Great game
[1:56:30] <%d1stantutopia> @andrewofbob never thought of it like that but yes, exactly
[1:56:36] <MrPandastic> There are some solid footsies in this game.
[1:56:37] <theredfox930000> crawling in my skin
[1:56:48] <Solidnick18> that was fun
[1:56:48] <crimsonsaens> Triple spite god Crawl in the future?
[1:56:50] <WeepyDevil> we done for the day?
[1:56:59] <+pickledundead> @WoolieVersus the monster levels reset each game, progression is unlocking new monsters and weapons to use
[1:57:03] <WakeUpThrow> We take those
[1:57:11] <%hologram_sam> tight game
[1:57:21] <dds333a> Reggie knows a thing or two about that philosophy LUL
[1:57:39] <FullMetalSnorlax> If you really wanted to redeem starcraft 64 play the minigames like zergling soccer
[1:57:59] <%JessterBoozebag> prdrummer3 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:58:49] <+DreyfussFrost> Let's play the real Starcraft for a bit then!
[1:58:52] <%KoopaPrez> ROFL
[1:58:56] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:59:12] <FullMetalSnorlax> starcraft remaster full LP lets go
[1:59:52] <+DreyfussFrost> Remaster's great for modern OS compatability but the actual changes aren't great.  The full game is free now though, you really don't miss anything with the free version.
[2:00:05] <%LittleCinders> @woolieversus  Woolie Vs StarCraft PC full let's play
[2:00:14] <slix3431> Remember the Woolie Cameo in Brood War intro?
[2:00:15] <+DreyfussFrost> SC1 was a huge part of my life during the 2000's
[2:00:24] <%ja07sj> Spawn Copy\
[2:00:28] <+DreyfussFrost> Spawn copy, yeah
[2:00:31] <%ja07sj> You can multiplayer only with it
[2:00:37] <%ja07sj> What a concept
[2:00:40] <+DreyfussFrost> Now SC1 is just completely free.
[2:00:52] <%dreadedcthulhu> it's occurred to me that I would have been less confused by my twitch notif if i had looked at the schedule
[2:01:17] <+Boner_Girl> Black people don't play starcraft. Let's be real.
[2:01:43] <+DreyfussFrost> The Jackbox games are also like that.

[2:01:47] <+xerotwo> oh? PogChamp
[2:02:21] <dds333a> Yeah, it would be complicated around now, but it could work, maybe, kinda
[2:02:26] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Starcraft CD key also was super simple so only the last number mattered, meaning you could put stuff like 1234567891234 and it would validate
[2:02:27] <%ja07sj> Steam actually stopped doing multipacks a few years back, when they started enforcing the regional gifting barriers
[2:03:07] <FullMetalSnorlax> no
[2:03:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
