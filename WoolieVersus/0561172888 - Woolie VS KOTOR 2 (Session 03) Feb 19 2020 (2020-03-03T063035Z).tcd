[0:06:10] <%Baxterj7> cheer500 Woolie I LOVE that Bounty Hunter series, excellent choice. This is why you're my favorite. Also those Obi Wan books are good YA stuff!
[0:06:14] <allenpie04> back it up
[0:06:17] <@Squdnate> @Manderson1998 I would recommend it, as KOTOR2 spoils 1 quite hard, because they go back to the events at times
[0:06:27] <+gustavozxd> well I gotta go watch that cause i gotta follow the playthrough lol
[0:06:27] <allenpie04> baaaAAAck it uo
[0:06:33] <+firmlygraspi1> it needs to be a plot device
[0:06:34] <fuji_92> but it is just dragon ball tho LUL

[0:07:50] <%alrobot2014> not gonna disney+ that man
[0:07:50] <+Manbearpigbear> yo, don't shit on fanfic, i've seen better fanfic than disney's
[0:07:51] <joylent_blue> i'm sure there are fanfics that are better written
[0:07:58] <Mvrdok_> If that one reddit leak was true, fuck Disney
[0:07:58] <OldManDeckardCain> sequel writing is so bad it rivals light novel writing LUL
[0:07:58] <+firmlygraspi1> you're not getting the full experience unless you read Twitter in the theater
[0:08:00] <%augusm> What were the tweets?
[0:08:00] <%bread_assassin> Hey, Force Awakens is one of the better Star Wars movies.
[0:08:01] <+Eightesu> Boyega should of been the main character
[0:08:02] <GarbageNirvana> My favorite part of the sequel trilogy is how they don't explain anything
[0:08:02] <clack14> joylent_blue most likely.
[0:08:04] <+glgzephyr> I mean we got some decent soundtracks out of it, so it wasn't a complete loss
[0:08:16] <Windermelon> disney literally said that "The expanded universe isn't canon to our films" which can *totally* be interpreted as....
[0:08:17] <+captainpodock> 7 had promise
[0:08:19] <+Ozymandias555> I love the new Trilogy. Really weird how it’s episodic on Disney+ and called the Mandalorian tho.
[0:08:33] <allenpie04> POCKETS
[0:08:33] <Djinnazz> lol
[0:08:35] <clack14> LUL
[0:08:36] <%JJCheeker> really only like 2 songs from the new trilogy that I like

[0:08:38] <GamerRider93> Honestly I don't hate the sequel trilogy, but I don't like it either. I'm more disappointed.
[0:08:39] <+glgzephyr> Before POCKETS
[0:08:41] <Ahk_90> BIG SLAMS
[0:08:41] <+Manbearpigbear> i'm so angry Boyega wasn't the main character

[0:08:55] <+firmlygraspi1> we are in DEEP bbt
[0:09:06] <theKingRamses> what about before and after maclunkey
[0:09:06] <joylent_blue> that space wizard is holding a fucking battleaxe
[0:09:12] <%augusm> @windermelon Remember that Disney fucked up and realised a lot of the extended universe stuff is better than anything they can come up with
[0:09:17] <+MasterGeneralVic> like Liam neason hunting people
[0:09:18] <allenpie04> are we the bad guys?
[0:09:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No it's just art :)
[0:09:26] <NZolozabal> @Windermelon "We'll cherry pick certain aspects of the EU and pass it off as our own."
[0:09:29] <%DatAsuna> They're not evil, they just want to "balance the budget"
[0:09:34] <Redblood801> FUCK CZERKA
[0:09:35] <fuji_92> we them light side bois making some noise LUL
[0:09:42] <Psyramics> Reminder that the Exec Producer for Stars Wars movies said it was so much harder not having anything to draw from like the Marvel does

[0:09:47] <Joestar1890> BTFO Corpos!
[0:09:58] <+thebonebard> looks like fanny is lining his pack with morality
[0:10:03] <Maleicus> its not even that good of a money
[0:10:04] <joylent_blue> never trust anyone who says it "ama-tours"
[0:10:08] <Windermelon> @augusm @NZolozabal Passion always outweighs moni
[0:10:10] <%bread_assassin> Those statues are bowing to the minimum wage front desk clerk.
[0:10:10] <%tearfuldevil> i kind of wish woolie wasn't going in planning one way or another
[0:10:15] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @psyramics *stupidity intensifies*
[0:10:15] <KaitlynnHere> Can you turn up the game a little? @woolieversus
[0:10:16] <muniea3> fill your pockets by looting their corpses
[0:10:24] <Mordexai0> awww. We're doing dark side? Light side is kinda better here
[0:10:24] <@Commando_Joe> Damn filthy Mirialans rooGun
[0:10:30] <abelincoln_catpuncher> game audio is a tad low
[0:10:36] <Joestar1890> Fann Y' fills his pack with good boy points
[0:10:49] <fuji_92> Kreia just hanging out with an axe LUL
[0:10:58] <%augusm> @windermelon What? Are you implying that Disney cares more about passion than money?
[0:11:15] <allenpie04> oh the poor rich
[0:11:22] <Djinnazz> that's still the option
[0:11:31] <clack14> never help the poor, they will die anyways.
[0:11:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Objectively, the best option is to fill those pockets
[0:11:43] <Windermelon> @augusm no i'm rationalizing how a company with infinite resources and a private military can possibly produce garbage from the most popular ip in the world
[0:11:44] <%bread_assassin> Apparently the outcasts survive and find their promised land.
[0:11:44] <Tucker0603> it's in SWTOR
[0:11:44] <%DatAsuna> It doesn't go that way, but they suffer a way worse fate
[0:11:45] <@Commando_Joe> A bunch of them survived
[0:11:47] <NZolozabal> Reading through the Thrawn trilogy myself. Starting book two.
[0:11:53] <%JJCheeker> Tax the poor
[0:12:00] <%DatAsuna> It's a bad place to live
[0:12:02] <Tucker0603> the cities got FUCKING RUINED THOUGH
[0:12:03] <Psyramics> Woolie, you literally saw it happen. Telos is the tutorial planet from KOTOR1
[0:12:13] <%DatAsuna> The planet survives
[0:12:14] <manwithaxe> it got fucked in a way more efficient way than a death star
[0:12:15] <%augusm> @windermelon Ah right, I misunderstood my bad
[0:12:16] <theKingRamses> it is still melting
[0:12:17] <fuji_92> Fidan Gilfa
[0:12:17] <+glgzephyr> @NZolozabal Enjoy. Thrawn is the best Star Wars villain
[0:12:19] <+thebonebard> the rock is actually teeming with life
[0:12:23] <Windermelon> no prob dude
[0:12:28] <+thebonebard> the place is super overgrown
[0:12:32] <+SolidusRex> @Psyramics Taris =/= Telos
[0:12:33] <+blastazoid00> I havent been keeping up with this. Is woolie good or bad on this run?
[0:12:39] <+glgzephyr> we good guys
[0:12:40] <siamzero94> @Psyramics no it isn't. telos is carth's homeplanet
[0:12:41] <%tearfuldevil> "good"
[0:12:42] <%MrMoonGoose> good
[0:12:46] <@Commando_Joe> He's good-ish @blastazoid26
[0:12:46] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @psyramics no the tutorial is on Taris
[0:12:46] <+Ozymandias555> Space Jesus
[0:12:47] <Naey_Naey> The poor actually escaped the destruction of the planet. Though they ended up pretty unlucky all the same.
[0:12:49] <%DatAsuna> @manwithaxe literally tho, every star destroyer can do that harder than malak's ship
[0:12:49] <muniea3> it's still good
[0:12:53] <%JJCheeker> This place was only mentioned in the first game
[0:12:54] <DSD24> Good with some dark side outcomes here or there
[0:12:54] <KnivesEve> we light boys now'
[0:12:55] <%DatAsuna> The death star is so redundant
[0:12:57] <+Rolandknight> Who is his co host today?
[0:12:59] <clack14> Space jesus for space jam
[0:13:04] <+blastazoid00> Cool, thanks guys
[0:13:06] <%MrMoonGoose> chaotic good, I'd say
[0:13:08] <tacostarvedbeast> Don’t they glass half the planet and if u help the exiled move to the other half?
[0:13:09] <%DatAsuna> Also there was no explosion when you flew away
[0:13:13] <%tearfuldevil> @blastazoid26 allegedly good, but a dm would have already marked him down as evil cause he currently owns a slave
[0:13:16] <@Commando_Joe> His co-host is Little V Mills https://www.youtube.com/user/LittleVMills
[0:13:26] <Windermelon> @DatAsuna can it even move? or do they just pend forever building a space station for a single star system
[0:13:30] <%DatAsuna> Also also Malak implies he's using a whole fleet to bomb it, but the FMV only shows one ship
[0:13:31] <%tearfuldevil> @MrMoonGoose chaotic good...........he owns a slave
[0:13:34] <+blastazoid00> "Good" is relative
[0:13:42] <%DatAsuna> @Windermelon The death star moves
[0:13:42] <%tearfuldevil> not in star wars
[0:13:46] <clack14> how many does woolie have?
[0:13:51] <Redblood801> Chump change
[0:13:54] <allenpie04> for my pockets?

[0:24:58] <Maleicus> yes
[0:24:58] <%RioGascar> cause PURE PAZAAK when he “hacks” in implies that pazaak is easy to him
[0:25:09] <%RioGascar> Or am thinking this is deeper than it is
[0:25:13] <%krispen_wa> Eww dex
[0:25:23] <%DatAsuna> he does play pazaak nonstop in his head
[0:25:24] <%SirGO0SE> @abelincoln_catpuncher deep toy story cuts
[0:25:26] <fuji_92> HECK YEAH DEX PogChamp
[0:25:29] <clack14> half warrior / half Diplomat
[0:25:30] <%DatAsuna> ONe joke that's not in the game but I would love
[0:25:34] <%krispen_wa> Don't tell anyone you leveled it
[0:25:41] <%DatAsuna> would be if you read atton's mind and it was just the sound effects for pazaak
[0:25:42] <GreyRavyn15> What ever happened to Darth Pockets?!
[0:25:53] <jorniev> I MISSED THE MASTERS TEACHINGS
[0:25:58] <%RioGascar> Oh yeah doesnt he think about pazaak constantly
[0:26:00] <RyuuAoi> FUCKING RICH PPL
[0:26:00] <Tucker0603> SWTOR has SOOOO much fasion
[0:26:15] <jorniev> little V is that outfit confy?
[0:26:18] <%krispen_wa> Too bad the market prices are inflated as fuck for fashion
[0:26:20] <+SolidusRex> More like Lopak Slut
[0:26:25] <%DatAsuna> I spend a lot of time on SWTOR just doing fashion stuff lol
[0:26:50] <%RioGascar> I spent decent time in star wars galaxy doing fashion
[0:26:54] <%RioGascar> then it died
[0:27:05] <%DatAsuna> The ther thing I would give swtor tho, it has fun stories in it's own right. People just overly fixate on references to kotor instead of giving it's original stuff a chance.
[0:27:21] <%DatAsuna> tbf fashion is easier on private servers now than when it was live
[0:27:22] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR would be amazing if it wasn't a sequel to KOTOR
[0:27:22] <Maleicus> i dont know whats so illegal about it
[0:27:26] <manwithaxe> what could you do to a blaster to make it illegal?
[0:27:29] <Maleicus> its not even a strong gun
[0:27:30] <SlappyMeats> it's been outfitted with a BABY DISINTEGRATOR
[0:27:31] <%krispen_wa> and if KOTFE and KOTET didn't exist
[0:27:34] <manwithaxe> make it too good
[0:27:38] <%RioGascar> oh no a gun that kills
[0:27:43] <%RioGascar> We made it kill better
[0:27:48] <%RioGascar> oh god
[0:27:49] <%ChoculaUltra> speaking of swtor, this mask Woolie is wearing is giving huge Arcann vibes
[0:27:56] <%DatAsuna> I like the potential of KotFE, KotET flushes the chances it had to pull it off
[0:27:57] <%RioGascar> The tsf is just a tsa parody arent they
[0:27:58] <manwithaxe> are lightsabers illegal to these people
[0:28:08] <%DatAsuna> Ideally KotFE would have been ME2 x 40
[0:28:16] <%DatAsuna> Building a huge team, doing loyalty missions
[0:28:19] <%RioGascar> lightsabers are classified as self defense
[0:28:21] <AdmiralCheeseburger> Wacky waving inflatable arm flailing CRIME man
[0:28:35] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:28:38] <%RioGascar> and what if a gang of people with babyskulls is running around
[0:28:38] <%krispen_wa> The only thing good in KOTFE was getting to kill that bitch Kaliyo

[0:28:58] <siamzero94> Ok big guy

[0:29:01] <stormhawk9891> KILL

[0:29:36] <%DatAsuna> note: when I say great character I do not mean good person
[0:29:52] <%RioGascar> look if a video game really wants to win
[0:29:58] <%RioGascar> just kill you when your sleeping
[0:30:00] <%krispen_wa> Kaliyo is a great way to write a murderous psychopath.
[0:30:02] <%RioGascar> or in menus
[0:30:09] <%krispen_wa> Which is why I wanted to kill her the minute she joined my agent

[1:55:09] <%DatLatinoGuy> lmao
[1:55:11] <lotharrio> 200 credits. That's enough for like... 5 cards.
[1:55:15] <%medinaj1990> you're doing evil wrong.
[1:55:16] <DXLelouch24> my PS4s worth more than that bribe
[1:55:16] <+glgzephyr> speaking of dancing we should go see how our ATM is doing
[1:55:17] <Mr__Jebus> One handshake and one pat on the back
[1:55:17] <jamesthebrave> Remember kids, evil doesn't pay
[1:55:18] <Redblood801> Dancing make more money than working for Czerka
[1:55:21] <siamzero94> YOUR NOT MAKING A PITCH LADY
[1:55:22] <alexandrecau> pazak
[1:55:25] <cacophanes> IIRC before the TSLRCM you could scam the FUCK out of both sides in Telos by taking the reward and betraying them

[1:55:45] <jorniev> you can also get a kyber kristal
[1:55:51] <%DatAsuna> The value of credits is hilariously inconsistent
[1:55:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Remember kids, slavery makes more money and is technically less evil than cooperating with Czerka
[1:55:58] <theKingRamses> she mentioned the ithorians
[1:56:05] <%SirGO0SE> @darkrenai LUL
[1:56:06] <+ultimafullmetal> Pockets took all the money with her when she split so there's not much left.
[1:56:08] <shadowsofpain> how long has the stream been going?
[1:56:20] <angriestman> her goons armor is more then 200 credits
[1:56:21] <jorniev> you can also steal a red kyber krystal from the czerka path
[1:56:26] <fuji_92> * J I N G L E *
[1:56:28] <damienlunas> When I played KOTOR 2 I played it as if Revan was canonically Pockets, and I ended up being Light Side because they give you better personal rewards.
[1:56:33] <siamzero94> PAID IN EXPOSURE
[1:56:36] <notenoughgirls> at least pockets left all the slaves ripe for y

[1:57:27] <%DatAsuna> Selkath don't have hammerheads
[1:57:29] <AKA_Caillou> Pockets used the skyforge to make credits which ruined the space economy

[1:58:10] <%RioGascar> The exchange’s receptionist is still there
[1:58:12] <WattieWasTaken> Is this Ithorian the guy who made the mod? Restoration Project?
[1:58:16] <%RioGascar> not sure whos paying her anymore
[1:58:18] <+Flambage> Fann is going to convince the enemies to unionize after learning how much they are paid
[1:58:19] <lotharrio> Lie, cheal, steat.
[1:58:28] <privatesargent> so in other words, its a big corporation

[2:07:50] <Zayasu> @generalve they took a break
[2:07:54] <WattieWasTaken> lmao Kreia with an axe is so fucking funny

[2:08:59] <snakemuho> "untruth" is a nice term
[2:08:59] <+glgzephyr> Geralt is gray as it gets
[2:09:00] <ZeeJiggle> I like that. Untruth.
[2:09:00] <ScreamLord> @wydamn And the Switch version will be the default best version because it's portable AND has DMC4/5 style switching
[2:09:18] <+glgzephyr> Yennefer is closer to a dark jedi than Geralt is
[2:09:30] <troubled_ginger> I love the [Lie] in this game

[2:11:24] <+Troispoint> poison worms omg

[2:18:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hmmm
[2:19:02] <cacophanes> give us some hype tunes V
[2:19:02] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus there was also a BOOK called the last jedi, and force heal was already a thing
[2:19:03] <+kyh9> Also, Bioware stole Kreia, made her young and hot and called her Morrigan in Dragon Age ORigins
[2:19:03] <+glgzephyr> force heal has been around since Jedi Knight II
[2:19:09] <Redblood801> The Last Jedi movie is just Off brand Diet KOTOR 2
[2:19:15] <AKA_Caillou> Disney loves Kotor
[2:19:15] <lotharrio> And Obi Wan maybe did it to Luke in episode 4.
[2:19:19] <%krispen_wa> @kyh9 nah thats flemeth
[2:19:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> And that meaning is slavery
[2:19:35] <TimetodiveLTX> tbh force teleport-objects is the hypest force ability
[2:19:35] <%RioGascar> so how is it being basically space walter white justifying your evil with pragmatic responses? @woolieversus
[2:19:37] <+MrSammichMan> force heal was not a real thing. because all of this shit is made up.
[2:19:39] <%DensityD> THE GREATER GOODs [and services]
[2:19:40] <BurdRightsActivist> Force Heal doesn't cure mortal wounds 4Head
[2:19:47] <Ser_Randal> its the free market

[2:20:43] <ZeeJiggle> The Half half
[2:20:48] <+FrenchTact1cs> Nar Shadaa Baybee
[2:20:50] <+MrSammichMan> Rey could shoot force lasers from her eyes and it would be just as real as any other force power. Because they're all fake.
