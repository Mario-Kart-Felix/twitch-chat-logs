[0:01:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL horray laziness
[0:01:45] <%Double_Tap_That> Zoom is impressive, but when do we get a dedicated Reggie Salt Cam?
[0:02:04] <Psyramics> Get a robot mech arm to hold the camera
[0:02:06] <%Exiliator> Now put the game in the tiny corner box LUL
[0:02:10] <%Solidnick18> hi
[0:02:10] <Dingo_Eejit> Did you set da camera to 24fps or 2.4?
[0:02:13] <%Solidnick18> no
[0:02:16] <%Superbro64> HeyGuys
[0:02:21] <+l33t_j4gu4r> we need to add ai to the mics

[0:02:37] <peachy996> Manual LUL
[0:02:38] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie vs the camera
[0:02:43] <TheSphereHunter> do you have an encyclopedia there???
[0:02:43] <felix_xb> its 1080 / 60
[0:02:45] <%mrhandsss> yeah do it later. not the biggest deal for game streaming
[0:02:49] <%Solidnick18> test stream PogChamp
[0:02:53] <+Gamefriendly> a different kind of Woolie will figure it out
[0:02:54] <+Maldoree> They still havent gotten past the hiccup?
[0:02:54] <+Dragoneye77> greats8Bunji greats8Bunji greats8Bunji
[0:03:08] <+l33t_j4gu4r> net test the stream
[0:03:09] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you need the whole shebang going to see the problems happen
[0:03:11] <krabsan> Sometimes its choppier but its fine honestlx
[0:03:13] <%Superbro64> he used it a bunch during the sfv launch days I think
[0:03:20] <@Solidus_113> Okay, I found the clear point to stop. @WoolieVersus It's when you get back to the first map and have the order to deliver Cryptobiotes. Stopping at this point will give you a clear path right to the end of the game next session.
[0:03:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:03:29] <%mrhandsss> ONWARDS
[0:03:29] <heroicspiritavenger> Your source is still outputting 1080/60 for some reason @woolieversus
[0:03:34] <Dingo_Eejit> @Maldoree - yes & no, there were audio problems local to the couch
[0:03:35] <%Exiliator> @Cykron It'll be like that one anime running currently
[0:03:42] <derap41> Cherry blossom shirt and Canada leaf pants
[0:03:45] <%wydamn> how can our stream be real if our eyes aren't real?
[0:03:58] <%ECRead> yo if my great-great-great-grandfather Deitich Valter knew I could summon a near infinite amount of information from a piece of metal and glass he'd shit his lederhosen
[0:04:00] <peachy996> Yeah that's a good stop point
[0:04:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> also remember to do the very last pizza mission
[0:04:10] <+linSP> thats good
[0:04:13] <+bread_assassin> That's a solid endpoint without giving a flaccid ending to the stream.
[0:04:15] <MyNameIsRasus> ACTUALLY CORRECT
[0:04:16] <+Maldoree> @Dingo_Eejit So was it located near Reggies fet?
[0:04:17] <peachy996> Yes you are not free from Pizza
[0:04:19] <Graxe_> So I guess there's an Evo thing happening tonight? Line up announcement?
[0:04:28] <Graxe_> For Evo 2020?
[0:04:28] <derap41> Pizza must be delivered
[0:04:29] <MyNameIsRasus> TODAY THERE WILL BE PIZZA
[0:04:32] <%mrhandsss> i woulda said the part before that, but if we get to see the transition from middle back to east region in this stream, im cool with it
[0:04:32] <krabsan> Oh man, can't wait for their reaction to THAT conversation
[0:04:33] <Shishi1205> last pizza mission is european extreme
[0:04:35] <samuraijakanddaxter> yh end with pizza
[0:04:35] <felix_xb> reflection tech
[0:04:36] <ManlyMcBeefington> Pizza Pizza
