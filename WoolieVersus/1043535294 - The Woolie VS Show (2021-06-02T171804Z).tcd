[0:07:53] <+Zanzibar_Junker> that works, just pace yourself
[0:07:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie failed a physical check

[0:08:22] <BenLubar> @BallerSwagBro9k it was a white check though
[0:08:25] <dylheim93> Going  for walks was the most i could do once my back inflamation dissapated
[0:08:25] <+neoexogene> Did Woolie injure his back ? Just got here
[0:08:43] <%Necnill> @dylheim93 same. Walks are the way
[0:08:48] <dds333a> @neoexogene it was the cause for his brief disappearance
[0:08:54] <MrPedrovsky> @neoexogene for a week now

[0:08:58] <%Seancicle> woolieLORE_FF
[0:09:00] <%holydeviant1> Oda Nobunaga's portrayal throughout japanese media is really interesting
[0:09:09] <%OldManJEWc> I can't wait for Woolie vs WATER PUZZLE
[0:09:14] <Cymen90> Do NOT let it set in
[0:09:16] <dds333a> According to how he described it, he just got up one day, and his back started murdering him
[0:09:17] <am_omega> this game feels great when you know how to Issen really well.

[0:09:29] <%holydeviant1> "Here is the man who revolutionized warfare and united Japan also HE IS LITERALLY A DEMON LORD"
[0:09:29] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Nobunaga hates churches not paying taxes.
[0:09:33] <laughinjester> yeah that's a lot
[0:09:34] <+neoexogene> @dds333a oooh I see ! Back injuries really suck, those are debilitating, hope he gets better quickly
[0:09:37] <+megaman_sentinel> this game has tank controls right
[0:09:48] <%OldManJEWc> I wish it was Onimusha 3 issen chaining though @am_omega
[0:10:02] <am_omega> @megaman_sentinel yes, it does and a lock on of sorts
[0:10:03] <dds333a> I'm still running on the theory that he faked a back injury so he could finish GG Lore Kappa
[0:10:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> onimusha 3 is the goat

[0:16:49] <%Afterman_> Choo Chooo HypeDerp
[0:16:51] <%Juriasu> I also have basically no idea what this even is
[0:16:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Play Blade Warriors, it's got Megaman.EXE and Zero in it
[0:16:54] <%zeroarturia> Choo Chooo HypeDerp
[0:17:00] <+monsieurfantastic> this game is the sickest shit!!!!
[0:17:05] <+carmillatype> This game rules
[0:17:05] <tzuin21> Soki, Oni of the Ash Kappa
[0:17:08] <%holydeviant1> @Juriasu Samurais Versus Zambies
[0:17:10] <fre3_reign> @juriasu it‚Äôs feudal Japan version of resident evil
[0:17:13] <Blank9> @neoexogene They change almost each game too, right? I think at some point you could do it after all last second dodges, after a good timed guard, or attacking just as you're about to be hit.
[0:17:17] <%Juriasu> whoa
[0:17:18] <%SirGO0SE> if i remember correctly, the puzzles in this game will ruin you and im here for it
[0:17:20] <+Prevot> oh no another recycled best friends idea
[0:17:37] <Blank9> oh thank god
[0:17:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, that is really good
[0:17:42] <leith_aziz> ah
[0:17:43] <%holydeviant1> woah what
[0:17:44] <%zeroarturia> @am_omega That was the only thing that disappointed me about the HD port.
[0:17:46] <%holydeviant1> seriously
[0:17:50] <dds333a> Ah, interesting. is there that for other media, like books, or movies?
[0:17:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh wow, that's awesome
[0:17:59] <leith_aziz> No spoilers? Nice
[0:18:02] <+cubbywolf> mmm herbs
[0:18:04] <am_omega> oh nice
[0:18:05] <dds333a> A good way to get others into things
[0:18:11] <fre3_reign> Isn‚Äôt that kinda cheating ?
[0:18:16] <+megaman_sentinel> wait there's a no spoiler sight on the internet
[0:18:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I,also know absolutely nothing about this series
[0:18:17] <brunoberserk> so people in the chat , i have a question : how bad is the Onimusha 3 pc port ?
[0:18:19] <+neoexogene> @blank9 I definitely remember Onimusha 2 having all of the above, Oni 1 I think was a tad more restricted
[0:18:21] <dds333a> @fre3_reign somewhat, yeah
[0:18:22] <+carmillatype> if you've played onimusha you know
[0:18:28] <+Juriasu> before you play: do combo
[0:18:31] <dds333a> But I think of it more like tips
[0:18:32] <+cubbywolf> is warlords the remakes combined?
[0:18:33] <Blank9> 2 even had the charge attacks too
[0:18:37] <+carmillatype> those herbs are important
[0:18:45] <SonofMelonHead> Won't the game itself have a tutorial?
[0:18:49] <fre3_reign> @dds333a like in resident evil if you knew where the key was and when the boss pops up it takes away
[0:18:50] <CappuccinoGuil> @cubbywolf It's just the 1st game, I believe
[0:18:52] <Blank9> nope
[0:18:56] <pirateofpie> I wasted WAY too much herbs when I played and now I regret it s it lol
[0:19:01] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:19:05] <%SirGO0SE> oh my god the orbs
[0:19:07] <%X2Eliah> @SonofMelonHead Some games are really not great at explaining stuff in their tutorials
[0:19:08] <+cubbywolf> well i like the 1st thr most

[0:30:55] <+cubbywolf> this game was so much fun as a young lad
[0:31:05] <wasdknife> will this be a full play through?
[0:31:05] <%Seancicle> „Çè„Åü„Åó„ÇèÊ≠ªÁ•û‰æç üíØ
[0:31:05] <+athuramn> here's the game manual basically
[0:31:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> Nioh .5
[0:31:12] <Memitim> I remember my parents renting like the 4th one of these for me at a blockbuster and I was so confused
[0:31:14] <%CptnCampy61> Souls come unto me
[0:31:14] <%X2Eliah> So this is Dark Souls 0
[0:31:25] <+Captbutt> @wasdknife hey said he might finish it in 2 sessions, so probably, game's short
[0:31:35] <+cubbywolf> give me your souuul
[0:31:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> Sekiro Shadows almost dead
[0:31:41] <+jamaicanbarber> It‚Äôs DMC upgrade mechanics?
[0:31:51] <%SirGO0SE> @Captbutt I think it's more likely they get stuck on a puzzle for 3 hours straight
[0:31:55] <+cubbywolf> pretty much almoat
[0:31:57] <+FuqBoiSlim> This isn't a very long game isn't it? I feel most capcom games aren't unless they're RPGs
[0:31:58] <GilliamYaeger> use rorbs to upgrade your stuff
[0:32:01] <%Seancicle> üèê
[0:32:09] <+neoexogene> Sekiro: Shadows gotta heal
[0:32:12] <%X2Eliah> Samurai's gotta have a more potent "herb"
[0:32:18] <dds333a> @gilliamyaeger better than Proud Souls
[0:32:19] <KaseKaizer> this game is the missing link between Resident Evil and Devil May Cry
[0:32:22] <+cubbywolf> dont hurt uour back on the way woolie

[0:34:20] <+cubbywolf> if you miss you miss
[0:34:47] <+StrikeTheErf> primary color and black is aesthetic speedrunning
[0:34:49] <+neoexogene> Red/Black just works, look at Dante
[0:34:52] <arkv01> nioh is basically the spiritual succ to onimusha
[0:35:01] <Indigo_Automaton> (Prerendered Corpse Nothing)
[0:35:02] <%X2Eliah> "corpse: nothing"
[0:35:04] <@Solidus_113> Corpse [Nothing]
[0:35:07] <marcdyllan> At least be a Corpse nothing
[0:35:11] <brunoberserk> at least be a corpse ( NOTHING )
[0:35:13] <pirateofpie> The solution is to use tank controls...
[0:35:15] <asakura_ayase> Corpse:nothing
[0:35:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> Nioh.5
[0:35:18] <+allups> this should've been the peak of graphics
[0:35:21] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> @WoolieVersus Do it in your PS5's settings
[0:35:28] <laserbeaming> Are you on Tank Controls or free movement?
[0:35:30] <%townzzzzz> LUL
[0:35:31] <BlueDragonBot> ReggieVs Nioh, when?
[0:35:32] <%Seancicle> mens sana in corpore sano
[0:35:36] <+Prevot> why y'all squeeze your sticks so much
[0:35:38] <KeiPrime> how do you accidentally L3
[0:35:44] <@Solidus_113> death grip
[0:35:50] <+Prevot> I almost never accidentally press L3 and R3
[0:35:51] <%Vigonept> combos
[0:35:51] <odd_slater> @laserbeaming It should be free movement by default
[0:35:56] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> @WoolieVersus you can do it in your PS5's system settings
[0:36:04] <+Reverend_Roscoe> change it at the "system level"
[0:36:08] <brunoberserk> this version still tank controls right ?
[0:36:10] <jazzcuzzi> noice
[0:36:22] <KeiPrime> ithink you can do both in this release of it
[0:36:33] <+neoexogene> YEYEYE ISSEN
[0:36:36] <jv5_guy> i played the og xbox version before my og xbox died , best decision i ever made

[0:37:01] <%Lightwolfe> that pok√©mon hidden item shit yeyeye
[0:37:01] <+neoexogene> Oh yeah this game has obscure shit
[0:37:18] <Equirah> "well, i0m not saving him"
[0:37:22] <KeiPrime> theres ps1 footage of like early onimusha it looks cool
[0:37:23] <wasdknife> have your thumb at the side of the stick instead of on the top to avoided clicking it
[0:37:45] <+somenum_bers> he killed...
[0:37:47] <%Juriasu> wow damn
[0:37:48] <%illtima> Look at those three stooges
[0:37:59] <dds333a> I'd be cautious, too
[0:37:59] <%holydeviant1> The bar is mostly to show "wow you got a lot of souls", as far as I know there's no real reason to hold 1 or more bars
[0:38:00] <FriendlyPatches> The should
[0:38:03] <Lionkevinson> #is this a one-off or an Lp?
[0:38:11] <@Solidus_113> full LP
[0:38:13] <deviljhojho_> i mean it was a really ugly hairstyle
[0:38:14] <+neoexogene> ‚ÄúSorry bruh‚Äù
[0:38:16] <FriendlyPatches> That hais is awesome dude
[0:38:23] <wasdknife> bowl cut bad ass
[0:38:24] <pixel_river> true
[0:38:26] <Lionkevinson> Cool
[0:38:27] <dds333a> For real, give them whatever, it's the character
[0:38:32] <%barkon345> Pats Comander Shepard is bald
[0:38:32] <+678saintglock> sometimes you gotta be a coward
[0:38:35] <KeiPrime> coward with your full head of hair
[0:38:35] <%Vigonept> he jobbed tho
[0:38:43] <Indigo_Automaton> Any kind of top knot or ponytail is a weakness in a fight
[0:38:51] <+TopTieramisu> if you don't have a 6head in ancient japan, you ain't seen shit
[0:39:02] <TonberryLives> I love some good ol' pre-rendered backgrounds
[0:39:02] <Equirah> Also, they just went bald LUL
[0:39:02] <+cubbywolf> helped
[0:39:12] <%dreadedcthulhu> "please help me!" *leaves*
[0:39:15] <JayEarly> why did samurai shave their head like that?
[0:39:15] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:39:16] <+eldragon_1> Most characters in Kurosawa films have that hair. EXCEPT the protagonist.
[0:39:19] <%X2Eliah> So was ancient japan really hyped for skinheads, or did you need to have the behind-the-ears hair?
[0:39:22] <%barkon345> I remember being completely mind blown by these graphics when this game first came out
[0:39:23] <+cubbywolf> customes
[0:39:25] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> @WoolieVersus change it at the system level
[0:39:29] <+neoexogene> @indigo_automaton any kind of longer hair really, I learned it the hard way
[0:39:30] <%SirGO0SE> my haircut :)
[0:39:30] <pirateofpie> Nice
[0:39:34] <brunoberserk> oooo
[0:39:35] <%robosqueeb> i think you can do finishers on them when they're on the ground, right?
[0:39:41] <+TopTieramisu> RE camera at work
[0:39:45] <Deasmeister> Compressed as shit audio ftw
[0:39:45] <%Kriss1827> the F E A R
[0:39:47] <+StrikeTheErf> bat dot gif
[0:39:51] <%X2Eliah> random bat explosions xD
[0:39:51] <Indigo_Automaton> @barkon345 I think the artstyle helps it look nice despite the age
[0:39:53] <+cubbywolf> the topnot was seen to help keep a helmit on but idk if thats the reason
[0:39:58] <pirateofpie> The tank controls are on the d pad
[0:40:02] <+mexicandetective> This game also has "deflect" issens when you block before an attack and then attack during the spark I believe.
[0:40:02] <%X2Eliah> Woolie has entered the Hole
[0:40:05] <+Fnir> It was tank control
[0:40:05] <Th3rd3> Hololive hole
[0:40:08] <jazzcuzzi> yeah you can execute downed enemies
[0:40:09] <superchunk121> Tank controls on d pad
[0:40:10] <arkv01> the original was tank
[0:40:13] <CappuccinoGuil> d-pad for tank controls
[0:40:17] <+Joe2187> Samonosuke go down the hooooollllee
[0:40:18] <Brothermanhyll> Nioh looks weird
[0:40:19] <arkv01> I think they added the analog directional controls for this
[0:40:24] <FriendlyPatches> dmc1 movement?
[0:40:29] <%X2Eliah> ... what
[0:40:42] <dds333a> yeah, so he'd walk in directions
[0:40:47] <%SirGO0SE> I rock the top knot because barbers are expensive and the ladies seem to like long hair :)
[0:40:48] <%X2Eliah> So it's not tank, but also not fully camera relative.. oh god
[0:41:15] <+athuramn> it's fast tank control
[0:41:16] <%wibbwobbler> Re remake
[0:41:27] <%SirGO0SE> yeah it's hybrid IIRC
[0:41:28] <%X2Eliah> what
[0:41:28] <JayEarly> most of the titular Seven Samurai have that ugly ass, haircut, even the young guy.
[0:41:29] <KNYGHT87> pffffffffffff LUL
[0:41:31] <%X2Eliah> OH god
[0:41:31] <Zeif00> LUL LUL
[0:41:31] <brunoberserk> RE BABY
[0:41:43] <TonberryLives> LOVE IT
[0:41:47] <KeiPrime> onimusha 3 had the best of both worlds, tank controls on d-pad, camera relative on the left stick
[0:41:49] <pixel_river> this is so RE
[0:41:50] <NewbiePov> was thinking of playing this but this re camera kind of a deal breaker
[0:42:12] <+Fnir> Not a mask LUL
[0:42:16] <%X2Eliah> The background art of these notes is nice
[0:42:17] <GilliamYaeger> Megabuster!
[0:42:26] <%SirGO0SE> @newbiepov don't let it stop you. the game is a unique experience
[0:42:32] <%X2Eliah> wait Ogres?
[0:42:34] <rekinom> God what a beautiful mistranslation
[0:42:39] <+froduck42> Oni
[0:42:39] <+athuramn> I could've sworn they added a different movement style in the remaster
[0:42:40] <%X2Eliah> .. is ... are Ogres a japan thing?
[0:42:40] <CappuccinoGuil> AHHHHH Firefox just changed its UI WutFace
[0:42:40] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> Without the Swamp, you are no match for the Demoines
[0:42:46] <rekinom> Oni means Ogre, which is the only real word in Japanese for demon, too
[0:42:48] <+Fnir> Ogres = Oni
[0:42:49] <pixel_river> the real nioh
[0:42:50] <+neoexogene> Without the Oni powers you‚Äôs a bitch
[0:42:51] <+captain_history> yeah, in 1 they translate Oni as Ogre
[0:42:54] <huskarl_zap> that seems like oni propaganda to me
[0:43:11] <+StrikeTheErf> demon souls, come unto me
[0:43:13] <rekinom> "You need the power of the Oni/Ogre?demons to beat the Oni/Ogre/Demons"
[0:43:15] <GilliamYaeger> I expect the original words were Ogre=Oni and Demon=Akuma
[0:43:21] <Equirah> Gotta use those Ogre Tactics
[0:43:23] <%SirGO0SE> in Japan Shrek is a demon
[0:43:23] <Brothermanhyll> Ogremusha
[0:43:25] <GilliamYaeger> Or Majin
[0:43:28] <asakura_ayase> Demons souls is the onimusha of dark souls
[0:43:39] <+Reverend_Roscoe> delay based onimusha
[0:43:40] <%X2Eliah> Yeah, OgreMusha. What does "musha" mean?
[0:43:44] <laserbeaming> I think the enemies are called Genma in the following ghames
[0:43:44] <Indigo_Automaton> Wait that box was wider than the vase
[0:43:46] <%Vigonept> i thought majin was demon , or that anime lying
[0:43:49] <SonofMelonHead> @SirGO0SE You telling me Shrek isn't already a demon here?
[0:43:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @Indigo_Automaton shut up, tho
[0:43:53] <Equirah> look, they wanted to keep the difference between types and so chose not to have "demon" twice
[0:44:04] <pixel_river> So oni in sf4 is shrek ?
[0:44:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:44:14] <chll0ne> u mean yokai?
[0:44:21] <rekinom> @X2Eliah Musha means Samurai
[0:44:23] <GilliamYaeger> Ah
[0:44:25] <KeiPrime> i thought musha is warrior so literally it'd be ogre warrior?
[0:44:27] <Indigo_Automaton> I guess they got that ancient non euclidian pottery
[0:44:28] <GilliamYaeger> The demons are the Genma clan
[0:44:31] <+captain_history> @X2Eliah Musha is warrior/samurai, so Oni Warrior
[0:44:33] <+athuramn> the cave seems to be a nest for demons. they call themselves "demons" Kappa
[0:44:34] <brunoberserk> Sougen's Bizarre Adventures
[0:44:34] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah ah ok, thanks
[0:44:35] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> @KeiPrime it's all ogre now
[0:44:38] <disflipmat> Oh hell yes, this is an awesome choice to LP
[0:44:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Normal Sword IMMEDIATELY outclassed
[0:44:52] <+Captbutt> oh alastor
[0:44:55] <+StrikeTheErf> got that oni back pain still
[0:44:55] <GilliamYaeger> Hence the original name of this release: Genma Onimusha
[0:44:56] <disflipmat> Playtime is ogre
[0:44:56] <+athuramn> it comes aggressive,  the upgrades
[0:44:58] <Equirah> @rekinom smaurai is literaly samurai LUL
[0:44:58] <Indigo_Automaton> He doesn't deserve these cool powers he's getting
[0:45:01] <+neoexogene> YEYEYE ALASTOR
[0:45:05] <%SirGO0SE> yeah this game gives you new shit pretty hard and fast
[0:45:09] <KeiPrime> it means japanese sword

[0:45:18] <Torgue_1> Yes
[0:45:18] <+Zanzibar_Junker> noooooo
[0:45:21] <rekinom> @Equirah Yes, they're interchangable
[0:45:34] <+neoexogene> Oh no fuck those
[0:45:45] <%X2Eliah> Man these puzzles are horrible
[0:45:47] <CappuccinoGuil> Really?
[0:45:50] <FriendlyPatches> Clap
[0:45:54] <%SirGO0SE> those puzzles get so extremely difficult youll pull your hair out
[0:45:54] <+athuramn> nailed it. can't wait for the later puzzles
[0:45:55] <Torgue_1> Oh Reggie LUL
[0:45:56] <%robosqueeb> thats not a key item is it?
[0:45:56] <Brothermanhyll> This really is RE
[0:45:58] <@Menitta> Reminds me of that one puzzle in Sonic Adventure
[0:46:01] <%robosqueeb> because if it is thats fucked
[0:46:03] <+athuramn> OH DO THEY EVER
[0:46:03] <pirateofpie> Hopefully.... Kappa
[0:46:08] <pi_in_the_sci> It open s a secret area
[0:46:20] <+paulomega7> Is this a first playthrough for the both of them?
[0:46:22] <laserbeaming> The puzzles got relatively better on later games
[0:46:26] <majindusto> Look at this Resident  Evil-ass game
[0:46:26] <CappuccinoGuil> You gotta use the jewels
[0:46:29] <Indigo_Automaton> Or the wind
[0:46:30] <disflipmat> owl.wav
[0:46:40] <%X2Eliah> So I legit have problems seeing what parts are "wall" and what parts are "area transition"
[0:46:42] <Solidnick18> that and the pot smashing sound
[0:46:46] <+IxDomxI> totsugeki
[0:46:46] <%illtima> There's also one stock Wolf dying sound
[0:46:48] <jazzcuzzi> this game has directional moves like forward plus slash iirc, but I don't know if they can be pulled off with the analog stick
[0:46:50] <%livlinn> shandOwl shandOwl shandOwl
[0:46:52] <+StrikeTheErf> breaking pottery is the worst
[0:46:53] <%illtima> I heard it in Warcraft 3 and Nier Replicant lol
[0:46:54] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:46:54] <+athuramn> those are rare candies, use eeemmmm
[0:46:59] <brunoberserk> OH BOY THIS ONE IS HARD
[0:47:05] <+Zanzibar_Junker> try to change the controls through system?
[0:47:07] <%robosqueeb> theres a very certain point in this game where puzzle skills matter and im so dumb that it blocked me for so long
[0:47:15] <+carmillatype> you can read these right?
[0:47:18] <+captain_history> this like DMC, it's a RE based game before RE4 was even a thing and went through some many iterations
[0:47:21] <Brothermanhyll> Woolievs bird
[0:47:21] <majindusto> Royalty-free Pot Smash SFX

[0:49:44] <SuplexSammiches> make a poll
[0:49:44] <IzanagiNoOokami> Cheating is lit.
[0:49:45] <+neoexogene> @sirgo0se Honor is for dumbasses look at the beginning cinematic in Ghost of Tsushima
[0:49:48] <majindusto> NO CHEAT
[0:49:55] <tattleworm> cheating'd be some ronin shit
[0:49:55] <pi_in_the_sci> There is literally no reason to sit on a magic jewel
[0:49:59] <@Menitta> do it
[0:50:05] <tzuin21> it's basically a purple orb, use it SeemsGood
[0:50:09] <%EdenOfSecondAccount> Spinny boys!
[0:50:12] <%Seancicle> üî§
[0:50:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Jewels are permanent upgrades. Use them freely
[0:50:17] <Brothermanhyll> No cheat unless stuck
[0:50:20] <dredgyboi> those spinny boys kinda make you learn to parry
[0:50:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> have we gotten an issen yet?
[0:50:25] <+LokimenD> also blocking is free
[0:50:30] <leith_aziz> @neoexogene: Honor died on the beach!
[0:50:32] <shinryu1331> use lock and d pad to strafe
[0:50:32] <+athuramn> twice @iamthetwitchghost
[0:50:33] <majindusto> Only Cowards Cheat
[0:50:39] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice @athuramn
[0:50:45] <+captain_history> Bushido is kind of like chivalry, it was a thing for books but nobody was dumb enough to actually follow it to the book
[0:50:52] <%Vigonept> we're Ll cl
[0:50:58] <jazzcuzzi> you got a parry there. you can issen after that
[0:51:06] <+athuramn> welcome to the police statio-...
[0:51:07] <+Captbutt> das a big boi
[0:51:07] <%X2Eliah> Isn't Bushido largely just revisionism of history?
[0:51:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @captain_history also, it was basically propaganda.
[0:51:13] <+neoexogene> @captain_history appropriate name given the fact you just gave
[0:51:19] <robosqueeb> most talented samurai in the world who unfortunately also can never remember where he is LUL
[0:51:24] <jazzcuzzi> YE
[0:51:32] <Brothermanhyll> The true samurai execution is to break an oar over someones skull
[0:51:37] <pirateofpie> Haven't figured out how to win those clashes yet
[0:51:53] <pirateofpie> Though I did once on accident. Mashing maybe?
[0:51:53] <+captain_history> @X2Eliah Yeah, basically it's Edo and Meiji historical reviosionism to give a national identity to Japan.
[0:52:00] <Equirah> UI offscreen?
[0:52:03] <shinryu1331> if you use r1/L1 for lock on u can strafe dodge
[0:52:18] <Indigo_Automaton> Right in the dick
[0:52:20] <Torgue_1> Chat, I missed it; is this Woolie'f first playthrough?
[0:52:20] <%X2Eliah> So is there any kind of dodge or roll?
[0:52:28] <%X2Eliah> @Torgue_1 seems like it, yes
[0:52:31] <+neoexogene> @torgue_1 yep !
[0:52:31] <+athuramn> you know, this might be the most well suited playthrough for people who enjoy fighting games because there's a pretty big counter and footsie game in this
[0:52:44] <+athuramn> *well suited game
[0:52:49] <shinryu1331> @x2eliah theres a lock on and u use d pad tank controls to dash in 4 directions
[0:53:03] <%SirGO0SE> @athuramn good observation tbh. wish this franchise got a reboot
[0:53:08] <+neoexogene> This is a good early game souls farming spot
[0:53:17] <+captain_history> there is a parry and evade yeah
[0:53:25] <%X2Eliah> Is this one of those games where you *have* to farm?
[0:53:38] <pirateofpie> @X2Eliah Kinda yeah
[0:53:45] <shinryu1331> a bit...if u invest in weapons instead of orbs then yes
[0:53:48] <+mexicandetective> for certain doors yeah
[0:53:50] <+athuramn> Instead we got a slow burning art piece that ends up in doodoo @sirgo0se
[0:53:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @X2Eliah not really. There are "level" locked spots, but you get plenty of souls naturally
[0:54:10] <+athuramn> and no, I don't think so. @x2eliah @cappuccinoguil puts it nicely
[0:54:11] <%Seancicle> üîñ
[0:54:30] <CappuccinoGuil> But you can farm, and there is a cap to upgrades
[0:54:33] <pirateofpie> I had to farm since I focused on weapons first lol
[0:54:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @pirateofpie lol fair, that can happen
[0:54:52] <brunoberserk> this game plays more like a Resident Evil
[0:55:09] <shinryu1331> they combine the orbs and weapons in later games...oni 2 doesn't even have level locks
[0:55:09] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Green Herbs LUL
[0:55:13] <+athuramn> this is you're resident evil police station. by back tracking through that courtyard often you end up accruing a lot of experience

[0:55:28] <+vexion_smh> YOOOOOOO???
[0:55:29] <shinryu1331> woolie no!
[0:55:33] <MaddyCaddy> haha...
[0:55:35] <+neoexogene> I really wish Capcom acknowledges Onimusha at all in some way
[0:55:36] <%X2Eliah> Uhm.
[0:55:41] <brunoberserk> save the game
[0:55:45] <+athuramn> eh, it's not the worst choice
[0:55:46] <%X2Eliah> Idk man, usually the starting gear is the worst
[0:55:47] <CappuccinoGuil> Saaaaaave
[0:55:58] <+neoexogene> Like at least port the other two games
[0:56:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Bold move, let's see if pays off

[1:04:41] <+vexion_smh> oooo
[1:04:41] <IzanagiNoOokami> That's a fuckin Red Ranger Sword.
[1:04:42] <%robosqueeb> womp womp
[1:04:43] <Puhff> LESGOOO
[1:04:45] <%X2Eliah> So swords are also door unlockers?
[1:04:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Honestly, it's good to upgrade ALL weapons in this, Woolz
[1:04:54] <+captain_history> this is the heavy sword and the other is the quick one, both are good
[1:05:00] <CappuccinoGuil> WOOLIE, LOOK AT THE FLOOR
[1:05:03] <+athuramn> this is probably the weapon that gets most vastly improved through upgrades
[1:05:05] <CappuccinoGuil> LOOK AT THAT BERSERK

[1:05:32] <shinryu1331> raizan is a grab. enryu is an aor
[1:05:35] <shinryu1331> aoe
[1:05:39] <CappuccinoGuil> LOOK AT THAT BERSERK LUL
[1:05:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The Brand!
[1:05:45] <Solidnick18> i see
[1:05:46] <%X2Eliah> Woolie just use the floor
[1:05:48] <+patel347> he was just saying it was berserk reference
[1:05:49] <brunoberserk> BERSERK REFERENCE
[1:05:52] <Gorshum> Berserk!
[1:05:55] <stormhawk9891> Oh that's just a Brand
[1:05:59] <%robosqueeb> my braand

[1:06:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh god, EVERYTHING got influenced
[1:06:13] <+royscreen> @fre3_reign I see you are also a person with good taste
[1:06:16] <BlackermanZX> oh literally a brand LUL
[1:06:16] <Solidnick18> yeah
[1:06:20] <Daxalog> Oh really?
[1:06:25] <Zeif00> Berserk Secondaries
[1:06:27] <prime_name> yuppers
[1:06:32] <@Menitta> I believe it
[1:06:35] <fre3_reign> @royscreen I am cultured
[1:06:43] <GilliamYaeger> All the swords are good to upgrade because they don't share magic bars - you can burn through meter on one sword then swap to another and have a full meter again.
[1:06:46] <%X2Eliah> .... sci-fi?
[1:06:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, also, each weapon has an individual magic bar. Keep that in mind.
[1:06:49] <TonberryLives> Que Theme of Guts
[1:06:50] <%robosqueeb> nickelodeon guts? yep. thats guts

[1:07:05] <%SirGO0SE> these guys are a problem without the bow
[1:07:10] <SonofMelonHead> Berserk was wildly influential. rightfully so
[1:07:11] <FalseKingAki> dont let them get away with it
[1:07:15] <+patel347> use thrust
[1:07:16] <%SirGO0SE> and theyre kind of problem with the bow too
[1:07:16] <Indigo_Automaton> SKELETON BALLS
[1:07:19] <+Arek_1> They steal souls and multiply them.
[1:07:21] <%robosqueeb> these guys give butt tons of souls
[1:07:40] <odd_slater> Flying buttholes
[1:07:51] <+Hawksworthers> This song though!
[1:07:55] <shinryu1331> absorbing multiple souls gives a bonus
[1:07:58] <%wibbwobbler> Every villain wants to be Griffith
[1:08:01] <FalseKingAki> dont they multiply the souls they eat
[1:08:04] <CappuccinoGuil> If you know the meta, those guys are good for farming
[1:08:22] <shinryu1331> ORB
[1:08:33] <GilliamYaeger> ENHANCE ORB
[1:08:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, each weapon has a magic bar.
[1:08:35] <+Captbutt> yeyeye

[1:09:01] <brunoberserk> orbs are keys
[1:09:02] <+patel347> the orb is for doors only
[1:09:05] <pi_in_the_sci> Enhancing the orb makes it a better key
[1:09:07] <+patel347> weapon is for damage
[1:09:16] <shinryu1331> now do lightning orb
[1:09:22] <stormhawk9891> Yep

[1:09:39] <+captain_history> there is a quick switch i think?
[1:09:41] <shinryu1331> L2 for quick change
[1:09:45] <fre3_reign> Yes
[1:09:45] <GilliamYaeger> Yes, they do NOT share magic meters so you have triple magic bars

[1:10:39] <shinryu1331> quick switch is new for rerelease
[1:10:39] <+patel347> the remaster added the analouge
[1:10:54] <Toni_Master43> Anything else for RE would not fit
[1:10:55] <paaadaawan> HELL YEAH WOOLIE TIME
[1:10:59] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Tank controls actually work better when locked on

[1:11:10] <whatatkins> Tank controls work better with fixed camera angles
[1:11:13] <shinryu1331> woolie learned about issen before tank controls I'm done man

[1:11:19] <+megaman_sentinel> bye-bye
[1:11:19] <CappuccinoGuil> LUL
[1:11:19] <dds333a> And boy were there a significant amount of games that had them too

[1:11:24] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[1:11:24] <%holydeviant1> Soul suck them in!
[1:11:27] <%dreadedcthulhu> riparino?

[1:11:36] <%X2Eliah> So how do you get at them?
[1:11:37] <HoldBtoRun> shit's gone
[1:11:37] <+Arek_1> The fire sword has better vertical range.
[1:11:38] <+patel347> you can use thrust I think to get them easier
[1:11:39] <CappuccinoGuil> That was a 3rd one that popped in
[1:11:42] <Torgue_1> Jebaited
[1:11:43] <%holydeviant1> If you keep soulsucking I think they get drawn in?
[1:11:48] <AnacondaVirtue> Apparently the flying balls multiply the orbs they absorb, if you manage to kill them
[1:11:49] <zentzen> dont you have the bow yet
[1:11:58] <dds333a> Get robbed
[1:12:01] <+athuramn> @x2eliah bows

[1:12:05] <%X2Eliah> woolie has nobow
[1:12:06] <shinryu1331> I think either turning ur back or absorbing is a trick to get them closer...not entirely sure though
[1:12:10] <pi_in_the_sci> Soul sucking should drag those guys to you
[1:12:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:14:11] <shinryu1331> it did have a 180 turn
[1:14:17] <CappuccinoGuil> We got strafing, babyyyyy
[1:14:19] <BlackermanZX> damn they actually say tank controls
[1:14:20] <shinryu1331> I think its gone though
[1:14:33] <+athuramn> hell yeah they do @blackermanzx
[1:14:35] <Puhff> @SirGO0SE to surpass metal gear?! :O
[1:14:36] <+captain_history> you can issen multiple enemies in 1 chat?
[1:14:40] <shinryu1331> door to the left
[1:14:46] <dds333a> @blackermanzx yeah, it's not really a colloquialism
[1:14:56] <+penguinlords> @captain_history no that's 2 and beyond
[1:14:58] <+patel347> lockon gives you a stab too
[1:14:59] <%OblivionSword1> is it DMC 1 lock on ?
[1:15:05] <+patel347> its really good for the blue guys
[1:15:09] <BlackermanZX> that strafe seems good
[1:15:24] <shinryu1331> I dont like lock on in future games cause it auto charges weapons when I dont want to
[1:15:27] <brunoberserk> yes
[1:15:28] <%SirGO0SE> @Puhff I wish, she a cutie
[1:15:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Please tell me you're playing 2 after this, it feels like a demo to 2 for me
[1:15:38] <Orfington> so it's like... blue keycard lvl 1, red keycard lvl 2, sort of thing?
[1:15:41] <Orfington> for the orbs?
[1:15:43] <pi_in_the_sci> you have to eventually level every orb to the end
[1:15:49] <+patel347> you will basically max everything in the end anyways
[1:15:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @Orfington basically
[1:15:54] <+patel347> especially with the bloodypalace thing
[1:15:59] <%robosqueeb> youll get enough souls eventually to just pump everything i reckon
[1:16:00] <MaddyCaddy> There's plenty of orbs throughout the game to max everything out
[1:16:02] <+athuramn> sword first *cough*
[1:16:12] <laserbeaming> Maybe level up the orbs as you encounter the locks?
[1:16:16] <CappuccinoGuil> This is an okay map, I like it
[1:16:22] <shinryu1331> prioritise locks
[1:16:31] <pi_in_the_sci> there's a bloody palace you unlock to pump everything to the end
[1:16:36] <fre3_reign> You can always find a door again
[1:16:37] <CappuccinoGuil> I basically went "level everything up equally"
[1:16:40] <shinryu1331> oni 2 had such a weird story mode with the item trading
[1:16:40] <%OblivionSword1> BIG DAMAFE vs DO COMBO
[1:16:41] <%robosqueeb> does red sword need more magic?
[1:16:42] <fre3_reign> You need stronger weapons
[1:16:48] <%robosqueeb> or did sucking those in fill both?
[1:16:59] <shinryu1331> sucking blue fills all magic
[1:17:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @robosqueeb sucking blue orbs fills all magic bars
[1:17:09] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus upgrading orbs also improves your magic attacks so there's damage reasons there too
[1:17:21] <%robosqueeb> oh groovy
[1:17:24] <%holydeviant1> Oh, this fucker.
[1:17:24] <%X2Eliah> oh nooo
[1:17:27] <Solidnick18> quiet!
[1:17:30] <%holydeviant1> (referring to BOTH)
[1:17:47] <+LokimenD> monke!
[1:17:49] <dds333a> the very same
[1:17:54] <%livlinn> STAHP
[1:17:56] <shinryu1331> this entire game is a level in nioh 2 btw (historically)
[1:17:58] <KeiPrime> nioh 2
[1:18:01] <%Necnill> The accent... the pronunciation.... kanpeki
[1:18:02] <Indigo_Automaton> WHAT?
[1:18:03] <Solidnick18> ooooh
[1:18:03] <KeiPrime> hell yeah dude
[1:18:03] <%OblivionSword1> oh hey MONKE
[1:18:04] <srv4254> it is just nioh 2 now
[1:18:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATS HIDEYOSHI?
[1:18:10] <AnacondaVirtue> Man this is a far ass way from Nioh 2's
[1:18:10] <Solidnick18> hideyoshi!
[1:18:18] <dds333a> this guy should be a big help
[1:18:19] <%OblivionSword1> yes that's hideyoshi
[1:18:19] <+Dova573> Thats just Yoshi
[1:18:20] <shinryu1331> but with the good evil roles flipped
[1:18:22] <+eldragon_1> Holy crap. Toyotomi.
[1:18:26] <+Dova573> Without the hide
[1:18:33] <%OblivionSword1> hidwyoshi started out as a jobber to nobunaga
[1:18:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Samanosuke is only commanded by the coochie
[1:18:35] <%robosqueeb> hehe :)
[1:18:37] <Teyaric> "I am a HYPERRADICAL, you CLANNIST."
[1:18:37] <%holydeviant1> (just walks right through a sealed door)
[1:18:39] <dds333a> If you said THAT at the time, people will put that to the test
[1:18:42] <Torgue_1> Wait, Woolie's not playing in Japanese?!
[1:18:44] <Sternieliscious> Hell of a prequel to Resident Evil 0. I wonder if Wesker shows up.
[1:19:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is this game historically accurate? Kappa
[1:19:03] <+athuramn> you tell him, you cardboard weirdo
[1:19:04] <%Seancicle> au revoir. cul8r
[1:19:34] <%robosqueeb> @BallerSwagBro9k it takes place during the Zombo period
[1:19:34] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:37] <CappuccinoGuil> "you fuck young boys, Hideyoshi?"
[1:19:42] <KeiPrime> classic RE, get the ammo before the weapon
[1:19:43] <KeiPrime> as a tease
[1:19:55] <Teyaric> Hideyoshi was origionally a peasant who worked his way up, so being a pedo is... Unlikely.
[1:20:05] <+Arek_1> @CappuccinoGuil LUL
[1:20:22] <+captain_history> it was 3 the one that basically had a Bloody Palace?
[1:20:27] <%X2Eliah> wait there are bows on that wall
[1:20:28] <%Vigonept> monster hunter does that, the arrow stabs
[1:20:34] <%X2Eliah> behind the chest
[1:20:45] <%holydeviant1> @Vigonept monster hunter uses spears for arrows, come on
[1:20:46] <dds333a> I wonder if his master is actually dead.....
[1:20:48] <+athuramn> dawn of dreams I think @captain_history

[1:22:53] <MaddyCaddy> It was the original controls
[1:22:53] <+patel347> d pad was the original
[1:22:56] <KeiPrime> yeah thats kinda the real way to play, dpad for locking on
[1:22:57] <CappuccinoGuil> The tank control is teh original
[1:22:59] <dds333a> I dunno, I feel it works

[1:26:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1399615868909334535
[1:26:37] <shinryu1331> each onimusha game had its own unique puzzle
[1:26:38] <keankong85> now you can shoot
[1:26:38] <brunoberserk> CUT THE ROPE
[1:26:41] <%X2Eliah> 10 arrows
[1:26:56] <EvolNom> Woolie love your podcast man, you get me through the work day
[1:26:57] <%robosqueeb> it should be like shooting a re gun
[1:26:58] <yuribo26> Onimusha? What year is it PogChamp
[1:26:59] <shinryu1331> I remember in 3 there was a special mode where it had all 3 puzzle types from 3 oni games
[1:27:03] <%robosqueeb> r1 to aim and attack to shoot
[1:27:04] <%holydeviant1> you have to cut the rope . exe
[1:27:14] <stardustno1r> Puzzles are the weakest part of this game tbh, kinda like the first Fatal Frame
[1:27:16] <%X2Eliah> R3
[1:27:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Is there something in the back there?
[1:27:27] <+captain_history> @X2Eliah Samanosuke kunoichi attendant. This game was from an era that assumed you read the character profiles in the game manual.
[1:27:33] <brunoberserk> NICE
[1:27:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ShinobiPhoenix subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Happy Pride Month, have some BezoBucks.  They are at least worth more than BisonBucks.
[1:27:38] <+Arek_1> Threaded the needle.
[1:27:39] <GilliamYaeger> nice
[1:27:40] <%robosqueeb> there we go!

[1:28:07] <laserbeaming> Have Fun!
[1:28:12] <dds333a> Shoutouts to instruction manuals with a notes section
[1:28:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ah yes, when gamers had to backtrack endlessly
[1:28:34] <shinryu1331> go down a floor
[1:28:44] <%robosqueeb> it fell down da hole
[1:28:46] <%X2Eliah> no
[1:28:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @dds333a Except now everyone has phones they can write notes in and take pictures of puzzle clues.
[1:28:53] <shinryu1331> cause u cut the rope
[1:28:57] <+xerotwo> doodWat
[1:29:04] <+carmillatype> I had a notebook specifically for la mulana 2 ready when that came out
[1:29:07] <+carmillatype> good times
[1:29:46] <dds333a> @shinobiphoenix indeed, which is just an extension of that. when I didn't have those things, I would write down things to remember in the notes section, hence the shoutout
[1:29:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I still have notes in my Google Keep just for tracking loot I needed in Breath of the Wild to keep track of hunting
[1:30:00] <TonberryLives> @WoolieVersus There's a parry in the game by the way
[1:30:05] <+Arek_1> LUL
[1:30:22] <%robosqueeb> i think its attack when the enemy does
[1:30:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or to me, shout out to New 3DS have a a built in notepad that you could draw in and take screenshots based on what you were looking at in game
[1:30:31] <CappuccinoGuil> You get free refills, but your magic is full
[1:30:33] <shinryu1331> the issen can be done off a block or an attack if u time it right
[1:30:33] <%robosqueeb> i could be wrong
[1:30:58] <Sternieliscious> I'm super thinking of a stream of adventure games and seeing brains explode over obtuse logic.

[1:37:02] <dds333a> Woolie running from this guy LUL
[1:37:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I just know I was good at it when I slashed something as theyh were coming at me
[1:37:09] <KUYAmoPESh> Roller got combos
[1:37:09] <brunoberserk> map button = P A N I C WutFace
[1:37:16] <pi_in_the_sci> the second one is by the first boss
[1:37:20] <%holydeviant1> Woolie shaking his fist at the soul stealers
[1:37:26] <shinryu1331> down the ladder
[1:37:27] <%robosqueeb> yes
[1:37:32] <shinryu1331> near boss
[1:37:35] <+The_Death_Owl> is this Resident Samurai May Cry?
[1:37:35] <+Arek_1> M A P . B U T T O N LUL
[1:37:45] <%SirGO0SE> @The_Death_Owl yes :)
[1:37:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> last second slash tech was strong in this game
[1:38:04] <%SirGO0SE> only had 10
[1:38:05] <CappuccinoGuil> You can just hit them if they are at level
[1:38:20] <Asuterisuku> Resident Samurai
[1:38:22] <shinryu1331> i remember in later games the black necklace that auto issens every strike but it drains health
[1:38:37] <+Arek_1> How do you do the kick again?
[1:38:38] <shinryu1331> and the BS trading that u needed to do
[1:38:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> what would a PS5/SeriesX Onimusha even look like?  Ghost of T with way more magic and corridors?
[1:39:00] <%SirGO0SE> :)
[1:39:05] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:39:09] <%Afterman_> the gauntlet
[1:39:12] <%robosqueeb> you could answer this one partially at least, neat idea for a puzzle
[1:39:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Listen, we said you CAN go back to these later LUL
[1:39:37] <Sternieliscious> @ShinobiPhoenix Nioh, at times.
[1:39:38] <KeiPrime> back + attack while locking on is the kick
[1:39:41] <shinryu1331> @shinobiphoenix a mix of dmc and nioh...weapon switching and hack and slash but with some defensive tactics for dodging and parrying
[1:39:45] <tanarath> NO HONOUR
[1:40:03] <blackkanye> Man this makes me think of Kwaidan -Azure Manor Story-. Which is weird since I have played this. But I guess I don't need to think about this game since I'm watching it LUL
[1:40:09] <%Tarhish> There was some bs co-op in Onimusha Dawn of Dreams.  But it still had fixed camera, so P2 could literally be fighting offscreen
[1:40:10] <%holydeviant1> I love that the swords look cooler as you upgrade them
[1:40:17] <blackkanye> Yeah I upgraded things evenly too
[1:40:20] <%robosqueeb> man the next weapon is so fucking sick
[1:40:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like Nioh is too fast versus Onimusha being more slow and delibrate
[1:40:31] <Asuterisuku> Orbs are keys. You want them levelled.
[1:40:36] <+Arek_1> @KeiPrime Ah, thanks.
[1:40:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @robosqueeb I don't like it, but its design is sick and the magic attack is super good
[1:40:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:40:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it is supposed to be Resident Evil with swords and demons
[1:40:53] <+patel347> did woolie find the green bean dude?
[1:40:57] <blackkanye> Oh yeah. That is why I prioritized orbs
[1:41:01] <fre3_reign> @patel347 yup
[1:41:17] <CappuccinoGuil> YEYEYEYEYE that's the true Onimusha experience LUL
[1:41:18] <blackkanye> Well there were other tank controls hack and slash action games
[1:41:19] <%paladinstarbuster> IS ONIMUSHA THE NEW LP? Pogchamp
[1:41:19] <+patel347> ah ok, had to leave for a bit, ill catch up later with the anime release I guess
[1:41:22] <blackkanye> like T.R.A.G.
[1:41:23] <KeiPrime> man games about samurais and ninjas fighting monsters are pretty cool
[1:41:23] <Asuterisuku> There is a shadow though, Reggie.
[1:41:23] <brunoberserk> oh man remember that awful onimusha fighting game that is a smash clone ??
[1:41:34] <+carmillatype> onimusha blade warriors
[1:41:47] <%robosqueeb> they multiply
[1:41:49] <+patel347> yeah thats right
[1:41:50] <+Fnir> you killed it
[1:41:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> blade warriors sucked, but it was fun
[1:41:55] <CappuccinoGuil> They don't have any orbs, but they MULTIPLY orbs they absorb
[1:41:56] <%X2Eliah> sounds right
[1:41:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @brunoberserk The Devil is a lie, Blade Warriors was hot and Zero from Mega Man X was unlockable
[1:42:00] <dds333a> They absorb only from enemies, it seems
[1:42:03] <shinryu1331> @brunoberserk blade warriors did have some interesting stuff in it... like orbs and issen counters
[1:42:05] <+Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Yeah, you can kick by doing essentially High Time. Knocks down weaker enemies to allow for a finishing stab.
[1:42:29] <blackkanye> Can't you stab downed enemies?
[1:42:31] <%robosqueeb> blade warriors at least had that one megaman exe guy
[1:42:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Massive risk/reward: let them absorb everything for maximum gains, but risk them running away.
[1:42:37] <+patel347> yeah you can down stab
[1:43:02] <KeiPrime> easier to kill those absorb guys with the third weapon
[1:43:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Get Into Fighting Games: Onimusha: Blade Warriors
[1:43:07] <%robosqueeb> thats frampt, you have to feed him poops.
[1:43:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That's just Pat
[1:43:10] <dds333a> Gross
[1:43:11] <iacus_> feed him a knuckle sandwich
[1:43:17] <CappuccinoGuil> It's just green Pat
[1:43:19] <+Arek_1> @robosqueeb MegaMan. EXE and Zero from the MMZ series.
[1:43:21] <+xerotwo> PAT LUL
[1:43:21] <fre3_reign> @patel347 there he goes
[1:43:21] <+patel347> it is just pat LUL
[1:43:27] <shinryu1331> its upside down pat
[1:43:55] <%robosqueeb> anytime you mention tank controls he comes down from offscreen
[1:44:05] <+BappoTheMighty> omg it's onimusha
[1:44:05] <$Kaiser_Loar> are they playing in Japanese or English?
[1:44:06] <%robosqueeb> or the zapping system
[1:44:13] <KeiPrime> english
[1:44:17] <fre3_reign> English
[1:44:27] <dds333a> @kaiser_loar the latter
[1:44:30] <CappuccinoGuil> @Kaiser_Loar we only suffer here, so English LUL
[1:44:41] <shinryu1331> what is the zapping system...I've only seen the clip of woolie triggering pat about it
[1:44:52] <CappuccinoGuil> YO
[1:44:52] <$Kaiser_Loar> good old capcom 2000 dubs
[1:44:57] <TigerClaws12> OOS
[1:44:58] <Asuterisuku> Nice!
[1:45:05] <%robosqueeb> @shinryu1331 if you leave an item behind, other characters can later pick them up instead
[1:45:11] <CappuccinoGuil> Orb absorption has a combo system, BTW
[1:45:17] <%robosqueeb> i think at least
[1:45:30] <GilliamYaeger> @shinryu1331 It's the scenario system from Resident Evil 2 where doing stuff in one campaign changes stuff when you play the other character's campaign on the same save.
[1:45:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> even the music is more Resident Evil
[1:45:31] <+BappoTheMighty> Who made Onimusha again? cause this feels capcom af
[1:45:35] <shinryu1331> @robosqueeb wait so nods steal items
[1:45:40] <shinryu1331> npcs
[1:45:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @BappoTheMighty capcom
[1:45:51] <+Arek_1> @shinryu1331 Doing one thing in a scenario will affect a later linked scenario.
[1:45:55] <%holydeviant1> Japanese castles were built for defense in wild ways
[1:45:56] <+BappoTheMighty> @CappuccinoGuil Awesome. Thank you friend.
[1:46:04] <%holydeviant1> Like, floors were made INTENTIONALLY creaky
[1:46:20] <%paladinstarbuster> onimusha is samurai RE
[1:46:24] <@Menitta> Yeah the nails in the floor thing is super cool
[1:46:27] <KeiPrime> i think this is flagship which is internal capcom sorta
[1:46:32] <shinryu1331> this is squid guys journal
[1:46:38] <+royscreen> I can't believe DMC1 is 20 years old. I feel like I should go buy some dentures and a walker now.
[1:46:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Onimusha and Resident Evil might as well be the same universe, but it would be closer if Onlmusha and Ghost N Goblins arer teh same universe
[1:46:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @shinryu1331 just left it in a random room for reasons LUL
[1:46:50] <$Kaiser_Loar> you could not quick change weapons on the ps2. you had to chang them in the menu
[1:46:52] <+Arek_1> "You're not Alexander!" LUL
[1:47:03] <+InvisiblessedReptile> Onimusha is so good
[1:47:05] <%SirGO0SE> its true, they do be sayin that
[1:47:07] <+Prevot> everyone is in bed with the demons huh
[1:47:23] <@Solidus_113> sometimes they turn into mechs too
[1:47:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> "Even Lucifer has a copy of the bible, it just has more books in it'
[1:47:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Smart
[1:47:26] <iacus_> the nightingale floor
[1:47:27] <shinryu1331> @cappuccinoguil what's also weird is if u dont read the books u dont learn guildensterns name till oni 3
[1:47:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @shinryu1331 that's the name of the Berserk looking guy, right?
[1:47:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:48:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is this Capcom btw
[1:48:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> speaking of LOST games, there's no way to play Onlmusha 2 or 3 now
[1:48:06] <CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k yep
[1:48:08] <%holydeviant1> There;s tons of them, some castles had bad rafter 'floors', which would just straight up collapse, some had nails that were JUST too long in sensitive areas, etc etc
[1:48:18] <@Solidus_113> every time? every time
[1:48:24] <KeiPrime> is gogandantess in this one or 2
[1:48:25] <shinryu1331> @shinobiphoenix not even through emulation?
[1:48:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @ShinobiPhoenix whaaaaat? No PC port? That's craaaaaaaazy Kappa
[1:48:29] <PMda2nd> a bit
[1:48:41] <+Arek_1> @ShinobiPhoenix What do you mean? Disc rot?
[1:48:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or Dawn of Dreams
[1:48:44] <+patel347> use bow
[1:48:47] <+patel347> if you have it
[1:48:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Bow time?
[1:48:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> no LEGAL way
[1:48:54] <shinryu1331> @cappuccinoguil ive never  seen berserk...but the liver guy
[1:48:55] <Asuterisuku> Out of ammo.
[1:48:55] <CzeekyTV> damn i love onimusha 3. i should emulate it again soon
[1:48:56] <+patel347> ah rip
[1:48:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ok this series need to come back. Im super sold on it from what I've seen so far
[1:48:57] <%SirGO0SE> you have no arrows and they must die
[1:49:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Capcom hasn't re-released it ever
[1:49:16] <+patel347> rip
[1:49:17] <TigerClaws12> oops
[1:49:20] <%holydeviant1> And now we see why the demons are winning
[1:49:24] <+patel347> I love this room
[1:49:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now that we know companies lose and discard code for their old games, I wonder how many of these games not getting re-released is directly because of discarded code
[1:50:12] <shinryu1331> red guys power through your hits
[1:50:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Healing orbs have higher drop rates when your health is flashing
[1:50:27] <%holydeviant1> @ShinobiPhoenix probably a significant number. Whole ass library of alexandria's worth of code has been tossed
[1:50:34] <stormhawk9891> Healing orbs are guaranteed on Issen
[1:50:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'd say its way more a result of them not giving a shit
[1:50:44] <dds333a> @shinobiphoenix many of us knew for years. now if only we knew which games specifically
[1:50:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> all the DMCs ahve been re-released and continue to be, but no Onlmusha's but 1?  No Viewitful Joe?
[1:50:55] <shinryu1331> click the bow
[1:50:55] <+patel347> should be in your inventory somehwere
[1:51:05] <AzureHawk_Streams> Dammit, I'm late! How much did I miss?
[1:51:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I JUST SAW THAT JEAN RENO IS IN ONIMUSHA 3. WHAAAT LUL
[1:51:19] <shinryu1331> @azurehawk_streams ooh a liver...so basically everything
[1:51:20] <KeiPrime> onimusha 3 is a trip
[1:51:33] <shinryu1331> @ballerswagbro9k yep he does French voice too
[1:51:33] <Asuterisuku> They don't re-release Dino Crisis either.
[1:51:36] <CzeekyTV> @BallerSwagBro9k YEAH oni 3 is awwesome
[1:51:38] <%ThisIsLloyd> ThisIsLloyd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:51:38] <brunoberserk> Onimusha 3 : Jean Reno'S ZAPPING SYSTEM
[1:51:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @BallerSwagBro9k Yes, it was a big deal back then.  there's a whole episode of Unskippable about Onimusha 3
[1:51:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @BallerSwagBro9k  that was literally the only defining feature of that game aside from being worse than 2
[1:51:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k but they couldn't afford his voice likeness, so they dub him in English with a different guy LUL
[1:51:54] <%robosqueeb> ooh fire arrows
[1:52:24] <shinryu1331> @fruit_pie_the_magician oni3 is the best... oni 2 is the one that has only two new weapons (even though I like oni 2)
[1:52:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so since playing Dawn of Dreams is stupid legally now, why did people hate on it back then?  does the hate hold up now?
[1:52:30] <shinryu1331> oni 3 has snatch
[1:52:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They fight Nobunagas Demon Armies in Paris. I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS REAL
[1:52:32] <KeiPrime> he does voice his own lines in french which is like two scenes?
[1:52:36] <+Arek_1> I think that's the total amount of souls you've ever gained.
[1:52:44] <%paladinstarbuster> scmoovin

[1:53:25] <%SirGO0SE> Kaede Kreygasm

[1:53:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the pre rendered shit in 2 is fucking amazing
[1:53:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I found Kaede to be the better fighter when I last played this

[1:53:50] <+patel347> oh
[1:53:51] <%paladinstarbuster> resident evil

[1:54:19] <PMda2nd> yeah, hold that
[1:54:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> and 2 might have only had a few new weapons, but it had like 5 characters

[2:08:07] <Th3rd3> now imagine Onimusha in RE engine TPFufun
[2:08:11] <+ar4ndomblackguy> i hope yall play oni 2. Its my fav out of the trilogy

[2:08:21] <%livlinn> So Woolie REALLY never touched RE huh
[2:08:24] <zanzibarian_hamster> It has that one french actor in it
[2:08:28] <+mexicandetective> @ar4ndomblackguy same
[2:08:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> And remember: There was never an Onimusha 3 on PC Kappa
[2:08:38] <Blank9> yeah 1 is fast and good, 2 is experimental and great, 3 is perfect
[2:08:38] <dds333a> I've heard that 3 is the pits
[2:08:39] <stardustno1r> yeah, pretty much
[2:08:39] <brunoberserk> yes , the gameplay evolves a lot
[2:08:41] <Teyaric> Oni3's intro was like, the HEIGHT of "FMV Hype" back in the day. It's an extreme example.
[2:08:43] <+vexion_smh> 3 is super fun tho
[2:08:45] <KeiPrime> oh yeah oni1 is pretty good but 2 and 3 just improve in it
[2:08:46] <shinryu1331> oni has weird creative direction
[2:08:47] <%CptnCampy61> That intro is the hottest shit to this day
[2:08:48] <+patel347> haha was the 3 port bad?

[2:09:04] <brunoberserk> JEAN RENO SAMURAI
[2:09:07] <%SirGO0SE> i only played the 1st but this LP might be a good a spring point to get the 2nd and 3rd running
[2:09:08] <KeiPrime> oh yeah that was the era of ubisoft capcom pc ports
[2:09:08] <pirateofpie> How is Dawn of Dreams, anyway?
[2:09:09] <+Mkingston> Onimusha 2 had a roadblock for me - Gogandantess
[2:09:14] <%livlinn> !motivated

[2:09:26] <+mexicandetective> I love dawn of dreams
[2:09:27] <Blank9> dawn of dreams is ok, but weird
[2:09:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oni 2 looks bonkers and jubei is better than samanosuke
[2:09:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> He has like 3 lines in the entire thing, it's really obvious when you notice it
[2:09:34] <Blank9> it's way more of an rpg
[2:09:34] <dds333a> Are they
[2:09:34] <+patel347> btw you can do an issen after a parry too
[2:09:45] <Sternieliscious> Want wacky hack and slash from the PS2 era? Eve of Extinction is worthy of riffing on. Your girlfriend is a lightsaber.

[2:10:31] <shinryu1331> whip
[2:10:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, for those of you that didn't play it, YES, you have to do the lever and trapdoor puzzles again if you fail the water puzzle NotLikeThis
[2:10:33] <+Arek_1> Whip.
[2:10:37] <+ar4ndomblackguy> Jubei is fucking amazing
[2:10:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HE HAS NUNCHUKS? I HAVE TO PLAY THAT
[2:10:54] <shinryu1331> @mkingston play it for the hilarity of samonosuke in modern times
[2:10:57] <Blank9> reno has a whip and grapple mechanics
[2:10:59] <Blank9> he rules
[2:11:03] <shinryu1331> @ballerswagbro9k whip not nunchucks
[2:11:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> @BallerSwagBro9k he gets a whip first and then a sword whip. Don't remember the rest.

[2:11:36] <+Mkingston> @shinryu1331  I was playing through the trilogy but then Gorgandantess fight on the beach stopped me.
[2:11:47] <stormhawk9891> They get more demonic looking as you upgrade them too
[2:11:51] <prime_name> SC has some great weapon designs
[2:11:53] <Blank9> gotta learn your charged issens
[2:11:54] <brunoberserk> yes
[2:11:55] <shinryu1331> @mkingston the rigged fight?
[2:12:21] <+Mkingston> @shinryu1331  yeah, you have to survive for so long (I think) and I couldn't do it.
[2:12:41] <shinryu1331> @mkingston it's not surviclving u hit his shield until cutscene
[2:12:41] <Blank9> it's a shame samanosuke never got into crossover games because actor shenanigans

[2:16:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ngl the dub isnt half bad. RE1 was way worse
[2:16:31] <+Mkingston> I'd buy a car off him
[2:16:35] <%paladinstarbuster> in real life too
[2:16:41] <%X2Eliah> @Asuterisuku Eh it's like 10% at most
[2:16:51] <%X2Eliah> and there's such a thing as blood/brain barrier
[2:16:56] <shinryu1331> @ballerswagbro9k its worse in oni 2
[2:17:15] <Blank9> 2 has gogandantess though
[2:17:18] <Blank9> his dub is the best
[2:17:24] <Equirah> it's not that there's nothing in it, just nothing helpful
[2:17:28] <Teyaric> Oh, man. GOGANDANTES.
[2:17:38] <shinryu1331> @blank9 it also has ekei.  the worst
[2:17:42] <Asuterisuku> I feel like those are actual kanji in the JP release, why change them to glyphs overseas?
[2:17:48] <dds333a> Totally LUL
[2:18:05] <+Mkingston> Woolie needs Gogandantess
[2:18:06] <KeiPrime> folding screens are also for getting cut in half
[2:18:29] <shinryu1331> I dont wanna watch woolie try to figure out how to beat gogandantess
[2:18:32] <Blank9> this might be more of a classic survival horror game than re2make
[2:18:44] <Teyaric> Real talk - On the Top 10 Vergils of all time, where do we put Gogandantes?

[2:22:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> EVERY SAMURAI GAME NEEDS A FIGHT ON THE ROOF OF THE CASTLE. Bonus points if it's on fire.
[2:22:21] <shinryu1331> that's a nice looking watch this demon has

[2:23:20] <shinryu1331> unload magic!!!
[2:23:26] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The camera was the final boss of so many games of this early 3D era
[2:23:27] <GilliamYaeger> Use your magic!
[2:23:28] <+Standard_Enemy> Imagine if fixed cameras were how we saw things in real life

[2:24:14] <Asuterisuku> Shield is gone
[2:24:14] <+carmillatype> let's get a shaky cam on this
[2:24:25] <Blank9> SUCC also doubles as a taunt to force enemies attack you, to make it faster to issen them
[2:24:26] <%X2Eliah> phase 2?
[2:24:33] <dds333a> Like that one bathroom fight in the Bourne movies
[2:24:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> yeyeyeyeye

[2:25:00] <%X2Eliah> oh it was dolph lundgren!
[2:25:01] <shinryu1331> new weapon!!!
[2:25:06] <Asuterisuku> STORM
[2:25:08] <taro_m> Where Jean Reno though :D
[2:25:10] <KingOfTheGeats> I love this weapon

[2:25:21] <KeiPrime> darth maul it up
[2:25:21] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp sure
[2:25:24] <Blank9> I was too into fire for big damage
[2:25:31] <%X2Eliah> that is nithing like the enemy's sword
[2:25:32] <+Mkingston> best weapon in 1&2 for me
[2:25:36] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> classic re cameras position mixed whit dmc action style.
[2:25:37] <dds333a> Twister in the house
[2:25:55] <shinryu1331> bitches
[2:25:57] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> yes i'm aware this came before dmc!
[2:25:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @X2Eliah it's not the weapon, it's the orb, it takes shape differently for people.
[2:26:00] <dds333a> Before it, in fact
[2:26:29] <taro_m> Is Onimusha another one of those Resident Evil 4 prototypes, like DMC was?
[2:26:29] <+Mkingston> This weapon at top level though
[2:26:44] <+Mkingston> @taro_m  I think so
[2:26:51] <dds333a> Why is wind in games green, anyway
[2:27:02] <Blank9> no, onimusha was actually a ps1 resident evil game initially
[2:27:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a green can be a refreshing color
[2:27:08] <taro_m> @dds333a leaves on the wind
[2:27:08] <Asuterisuku> Because it blows leaves around?
[2:27:15] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> camera gives it a classic feel but it just doesn't work for an action focused game
[2:27:17] <GilliamYaeger> @dds333a Because red is fire, blue is water, yellow is lightning. Green is the last primary color left unused.
[2:27:21] <shinryu1331> wind power is green energy
[2:27:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> @taro_m was about to say, that too
[2:27:28] <GilliamYaeger> Also the color of leaves blowing in the wind
[2:27:31] <%X2Eliah> @dds333a Because blue is taken by water
[2:27:33] <taro_m> Now punch that child
[2:27:34] <Blank9> it did inspire DMC1 specifically because one of the bugs in Onimusha's testing was enemy juggles that they then added intentionally to DMC1 for air combos
[2:27:40] <%Tearonex> You're safe with my big dumb hand

[2:30:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT
[2:30:27] <shinryu1331> but samonosuke does the work
[2:30:31] <bonebagMEL> Just got here, he's not using tank controls right?
[2:30:34] <pirateofpie> @Asuterisuku That's true
[2:30:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> @bonebagMEL nope
[2:30:41] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> Nobunaga was the more progressive guy despite being a ruthless conqueror
[2:30:55] <dds333a> Yep, Tom Cruise
[2:30:55] <%jepupu> Looking at this game, I'm just getting more confused why people disliked Dawn of Dreams.
[2:30:56] <shinryu1331> william comes later....this is nioh 2
[2:30:57] <+Mkingston> I'm currently wearing the Hollow Knight CSB shirt.

[2:31:14] <KeiPrime> yeah william is when tokugawa is in power?
[2:31:27] <brunoberserk> EVIL GIGER DOOR
[2:31:29] <shinryu1331> william is tokugawa vs ishida
[2:31:37] <Asuterisuku> Not heavy enough to make the big guys stagger.
[2:31:39] <shinryu1331> and nioh 2 is nobunaga up to hideyoshi
[2:31:50] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> that whirlwind aoe is really good
[2:32:16] <%X2Eliah> Man, imagine a game set in the nobunaga time that has *all* the storylines of other games set around nobunaga going on in the background
[2:32:22] <%X2Eliah> A big shared nobunaga metaverse
[2:32:34] <Blank9> including pokemon conquest?
[2:32:35] <+Prevot> so when did this franchise die?
[2:32:43] <KeiPrime> if it were koei tecmo yeah the shared nobunga-verse is plausible
[2:32:43] <pirateofpie> Their grabs suck
[2:32:44] <Asuterisuku> Add anime into the list. Nobunagun is cannon.
[2:32:45] <%thesw1tch> the tech
[2:32:49] <Blank9> died at Dawn of Dreams
[2:32:55] <KeiPrime> this franchise died with dawn of dreams? so like 06?
[2:32:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Prevot 2004ish
[2:32:59] <shinryu1331> @x2eliah all the games have different views of nobunaga and the history...nioh probably has the most kind depiction of nobunaga
[2:33:16] <shinryu1331> whereas in oni nobunaga drinks blood and shit
[2:33:16] <+Prevot> wow didn't last long huh
[2:33:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Prevot it had 3 games
[2:33:28] <+Arek_1> I lost the name of the guy. I think people didn't like Dawn of Dreams 'cause of its more anime theme.
[2:33:33] <%X2Eliah> @Prevot that soon? this one is from 01
[2:33:35] <bonebagMEL> @shinryu1331 Yep, In Nioh Nobunaga was legit portrayed as the coolest guy
[2:33:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> also oni 2 is like 3 times as long
[2:33:45] <@Menitta> Nioh's nobunaga is the coolest guy
[2:33:49] <brunoberserk> LOOKS IS PAT
[2:33:57] <KeiPrime> yasuke even shows up in both niohs
[2:34:17] <shinryu1331> in nioh there are no "bad guys " or good guys just misguided warlords who are all bad
[2:34:27] <TigerClaws12> @Menitta "Cooles Guy" huh Kappa
[2:34:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> Isn't there something important in the room the boy was in?

[2:36:17] <SuperFightinRobot> Royal Guard!
[2:36:17] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus It's easier to Issen the rolling attack
[2:36:26] <pirateofpie> @patel347 Ahhh, I get what you mean lol
[2:37:21] <Asuterisuku> I think enemies are colour coded based on what weapon you should be using but I could be wrong about that.
[2:37:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:37:28] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> They should bring back environmental puzzles into modern gaming. Old RE style games understood that

[2:39:15] <%X2Eliah> nobunaga was kind of like ghengis khan without the reach
[2:39:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh most "heroes" from that period made many atrociti
[2:39:25] <+RowenCleric> I dunno he seems kinda cool and hot tho
[2:39:27] <DatAsuna> media does tend to paper over tokugawa tho
[2:39:57] <Asuterisuku> Charming.
[2:40:14] <+StrikeTheErf> nobunaga actually translates to "morally grey"
[2:40:14] <+Prevot> what's the love element weapon? a whip?
[2:40:32] <Asuterisuku> Pathfinder would say yes.
[2:40:35] <%holydeviant1> Oh hey it's Carmak area
[2:40:38] <brunoberserk> EVIL
[2:40:39] <KeiPrime> according to sailor moon, yeah its a chain or a whip

[3:01:00] <+RowenCleric> thats what Max calls "The Fear!"
[3:01:06] <+Arek_1> @cinless Usually legs are way more protected. By the idea back then is that to angle your cuts that low, you have to be closer to the enemy than you should be. Leaving your head and chest exposed.

[3:02:17] <+kiiingdorr> @CptnCampy61 That would've be fly af.
[3:02:17] <Killhooligan> there's like 2 or 3 fluorite in the bloody palace section
[3:02:17] <jetjagger222> @CptnCampy61 because he's based off a real actor and got licensing shit i suppose
[3:02:20] <+RowenCleric> most likely because his face is based on a real actor, and so it costs money to recreate him
[3:02:28] <1000_buffers> wow this is what games were like before dark souls

[3:12:14] <dds333a> So, going by the RE eventual influence, she has a "gun" then?
[3:12:23] <dds333a> heavy air quotes, by the way
[3:12:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I wish I could play it in Japanese because the english is a little fucked
[3:12:41] <+patel347> her issen is super difficult
[3:12:42] <Asuterisuku> Reminder that Kappas suck out peoples souls through their butts.
[3:12:54] <AthenaAegis> @CptnCampy61 Just came back in. What yokai? You talkin bout the one with an eye in its butthole? Kappa
[3:12:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:12:56] <brunoberserk> NOPE
[3:12:58] <%X2Eliah> wow
[3:12:59] <+megaman_sentinel> you can do stuff LOL
[3:13:21] <+neoexogene> @asuterisuku like the headless demons in Sekiro, their grab is just shoving a hand up your ass to pull out the soul
[3:13:25] <cinless> this is making me want to play kunimitsu
[3:13:29] <%holydeviant1> Hahahaha every time
[3:13:29] <+mexicandetective> I love her neck slice move
[3:13:38] <+pupil31> SourPls
[3:13:43] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> fun moves yet game says, what you doing? NO EXP!
[3:13:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The Hajiji issen is easier, you just time it after a block. way less potentially costly
[3:14:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hajiki issen i mean
[3:14:14] <%X2Eliah> you have a red key
[3:14:18] <+kiiingdorr> Oh. I think I remember how this segment ends.
[3:14:41] <Asuterisuku> Woolie vs. Maps
[3:14:45] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> this game turns into cheese mode once you learn how to perfect parry everything
[3:14:45] <Killhooligan> west prison in the plaza
[3:15:01] <seriousink> curious if woolie will ever figure out her gimmick
[3:15:31] <+neoexogene> @jetstreamlover_ryocan even more so in Oni 2 and 3 where you chain issen
[3:15:41] <%alpharius88> so how its sakura (naruto)?
[3:16:04] <dds333a> Taki who LUL
[3:16:04] <+megaman_sentinel> lock on
[3:16:07] <%X2Eliah> better than sakura (boruto)
[3:16:29] <cinless> gun?
[3:16:39] <KeiPrime> whats to run? action? forward and action while locking?
[3:16:42] <jetjagger222> wow the bgm is super dramatic for this section
[3:17:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> It must be enemy specific, right?
[3:17:08] <%X2Eliah> a game from2001 has achievements? cool!
[3:17:08] <dds333a> @cinless apparently there's a bowgun that can be acquired later
[3:17:30] <Killhooligan> you can get a rifle
[3:17:34] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a there's a bow AND a gun
[3:17:40] <dds333a> I've never played this, so I was just going off by what chat said
[3:17:45] <cinless> i was about to say something about ancient japanese guns, but actually yeah they did have those
[3:17:50] <+mexicandetective> I think it's down up and attack or something similar with lock on
[3:17:55] <KeiPrime> yeah matchlock rifles are a thing
[3:17:59] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil gotcha, thanks
[3:18:06] <seriousink> nobunaga famously loved guns
[3:18:14] <+neoexogene> Matchlock rifles are so cool
[3:18:21] <dds333a> @killhooligan Also thanks
[3:18:26] <jetjagger222> anyone saw kagemusha
[3:18:46] <+megaman_sentinel> just go
[3:18:57] <+neoexogene> @seriousink and wielded double sawed-off shotguns according to Devil Kings/Sengoku Basara
[3:18:58] <Asuterisuku> Stopping to fight everything when fights have no benefit.
[3:19:00] <+xerotwo> O W
[3:19:02] <dds333a> Like the cloud, Like the Wind and golden kamuy jad their fair share of guns too, although the former took place decades before the latter
[3:19:04] <+carmillatype> just do issen
[3:19:19] <%paladinstarbuster> shes a normal person with np super gauntlets
[3:19:20] <Sternieliscious> I'm getting flashbacks to The Girl sections in Chaos Legion.
[3:19:35] <Killhooligan> kaede gets a demon knife I think
[3:19:47] <Asuterisuku> And so that guy was killed by the archers.
[3:19:48] <KeiPrime> towards enemy and x while locked on

[3:21:33] <jetjagger222> also don't the treasure chests look very similar to the ones from ninja gaiden
[3:22:30] <funwashere> I wonder, does Onimusha have a speedrunning scene?
[3:22:41] <+Prevot> you know with there being no benefit to killing enemies this basically becomes RE, just run past everything
[3:22:55] <Senor_Monty> yooo onimusha so lit
[3:22:56] <verscoll> tree tech
[3:23:09] <+athuramn> tree physics on point
[3:23:15] <+captain_history> 2001 tree tech
[3:23:19] <+croxeye> on the left
[3:23:25] <Asuterisuku> Oh no he found a thing in one of them and now he has to check ALL of them.
[3:23:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> it's just for funsies
[3:23:48] <brunoberserk> CHEAT TIME
[3:24:26] <dds333a> Reggie looking for ANY REASON
[3:24:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS SHE SAKURA?
[3:24:30] <AnacondaVirtue> USELESS
[3:24:32] <Blank9> kaede rules you get good at the jumps and she does throat cuts
[3:24:42] <Asuterisuku> At least Sakura does heals.
[3:24:43] <AthenaAegis> Kaede is Onimusha's Ada Wong Kappa
[3:24:45] <s1rcuit> tbf a stealth build isn't that useful against a demon invasion
[3:24:55] <rekinom> She does have that absolute territory going on though
[3:24:56] <%paladinstarbuster> shes just a normal ninja girl in orange
[3:24:58] <KeiPrime> thigh tattoo tho
[3:25:07] <prime_name> Atleast she isn't Natsu
[3:25:08] <brunoberserk> at least the girls in onimusha 2 and 3 are cool
[3:25:14] <LoreKeeper_Thal> she gotta compete with Ayame from TEnch who's WAY COOLER
[3:25:21] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Tenchu*
[3:25:25] <jetjagger222> yeah ayame got the sass
[3:25:35] <dds333a> @prime_name thank GOD she isn't
[3:25:45] <+captain_history> i think the whole point in Onimusha 1 is that everyone would be kind of fucked without the oni gauntlet being a thing
[3:25:55] <dds333a> SoulCal thankfully has cooled it with the ninjas
[3:26:27] <cinless> soulcal's still got two ninjas
[3:26:51] <KeiPrime> yeah taki, yoshimitsu, and NO OTHEr Ninjas

[3:32:47] <dds333a> @thetunnelhomer to be honest, it's Onimusha, although I've never played it myself. it's a Capcom PS2 game
[3:32:49] <+dustiler> Nah ill jump in neutral
[3:32:51] <shinryu1331> has he learned kaede is useless yet?

[3:50:19] <CalderGaming> Bloody Palace woooo
[3:50:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> NO
[3:50:21] <drunken_lemur> Work that thing like a speed bag.
[3:50:22] <%holydeviant1> bLOODY mINI pALACE
[3:50:33] <stardustno1r> You can do it
[3:50:33] <shinryu1331> best weapon in the game if u do this
[3:50:33] <armchairmaster_> N o
[3:50:39] <Applecannon63> Pat?
[3:50:41] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It's how you unlock the ultimate weapon
[3:50:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hi Pat
[3:50:45] <+picante_papi> It's easy, just make sure you've got parrying down
[3:50:46] <+Captbutt> it gives you stuff, doesn't it?
[3:50:52] <PlanetNixia> And the amazing 'Gale' theme that plays during it
[3:50:53] <stardustno1r> It's worth it tbh
[3:50:58] <Sonny_Firestorm> Gauntlet Lv1 and 2 are so ugly compared to Lv3.
[3:51:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> @shinryu1331 what did the gauntlet upgrade do?
[3:51:04] <+snausages_> the music is different tho isnt it
[3:51:05] <pi_in_the_sci> switch you weapons to suck up all the magic
[3:51:05] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus  dark realm is basically the bloody palace , if you finish you get the best weapon in the game
[3:51:07] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> so close
[3:51:09] <+picante_papi> @Captbutt Yes
[3:51:15] <%holydeviant1> @CappuccinoGuil more souls more succ
[3:51:17] <shinryu1331> @cappuccinoguil I think it improves the speed of absorption
[3:51:26] <+picante_papi> Gives you better succ power
[3:51:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> oh alright then
[3:51:27] <Asuterisuku> Bloody Palace time?
[3:51:31] <shinryu1331> or the range
[3:51:45] <Sonny_Firestorm> @CappuccinoGuil Strengthens soul sucking, making it faster and at lv3 it destabilizes those suck-sucking Genma.
[3:52:12] <shinryu1331> in later games the gauntlet becomes it's own item to manually upgrade same as the weapons
[3:52:14] <Jetstreamlover_ryocan> better suck should just been from the beginning
[3:52:38] <thatpurplefunk> this music is pretty creepy
[3:52:43] <cinless> how's the battery life on those headphones?
[3:53:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> Past that demon door it's the end
[3:53:08] <shinryu1331> before we go can we see reggie react to the oni 3 intro?
[3:53:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> Nah, because Lv3 Gauntlet comes with the rather busted ability to pull the Soul-sucking Orbs towards you.
[3:53:32] <brunoberserk> this game is kinda short compared to the other onimusha games
[3:53:42] <pirateofpie> Yeah
[3:53:45] <shinryu1331> every level u get an xit
[3:53:49] <brunoberserk> yes
[3:53:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, "bloody palace" is a part of the game in Onimusha.
[3:54:00] <Sonny_Firestorm> It's not a separate mode.
[3:54:01] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Just get to level 20 to unlock the weapon
[3:54:25] <Sonny_Firestorm> Outro Time?
[3:54:28] <arkv01> SQUEEEEZE
