[0:02:26] <@Moobot> @Menitta Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg

[0:02:34] <+0neReeler> OOOO elden ring
[0:02:38] <kadjah> Reggie clocking overtime
[0:02:38] <rommlll> elden t's
[0:02:38] <xUrbanCarnage> @orochiblood probably not but that thing is sick
[0:02:41] <iacus_> Elden deserves a double shift, it's a big game
[0:02:49] <@Menitta> THE STORM
[0:02:49] <%thesickestzak> Elden Ring x 24
[0:02:52] <%holydeviant1> My advice is to scrape the map before touching Stormviel approach
[0:02:54] <leith_aziz> It's Modding Baby!
[0:02:55] <Blank9> Huh, found out stats scale a bit different than usual, they actually grow most between 20-40 for a lot.
[0:02:55] <orochiblood> is woolie scaling INT?
[0:03:09] <@Menitta> I am SUPER excited to see busted Vergil
[0:03:10] <WUFFLEBEAM_PRIME> OMG i just realised we might get a GiFG: Cyberbots
[0:03:14] <CappuccinoGuil> When was the last time they were playing 2 RPGs at once? Like, damn
[0:03:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> game's big
[0:03:27] <secret_npc> playing this as my first From game I've concluded that fans of these games have the worst fucking senses of humour
[0:03:50] <+trackles_64> elden ring is nothing but new things
[0:03:54] <leomuratore> woolieFROG
[0:03:55] <@Menitta> dog?
[0:03:57] <%notsoy> worst? the game with the loathsome dung eater is the worst sense of humor?
[0:04:03] <+Nekros4442> @secret_npc but finger
[0:04:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> @secret_npc I think it's extra bad because SO MANY people are playing rn
[0:04:06] <stormhawk9891> @WUFFLEBEAM_PRIME We already did that
[0:04:15] <CappuccinoGuil> @secret_npc you don't find it hilarious when you run past a fire trap to get pounced on by an enemy on the ceiling? LUL

[0:04:25] <%Lion_kun> Woolie you are gonna bite the bullet and play 5 months of this at least
[0:04:26] <@Menitta> idc, I think turtle = dog is the funniest thing ever LUL
[0:04:27] <Pubstar_LTD> Elden Ring?! Kreygasm
[0:04:27] <leomuratore> PotFriend
[0:04:27] <+WanderTasogare> remembers DMC 5 lmaoo
[0:04:29] <%holydeviant1> @WoolieVersus  I have a near-complete map of the first area and some knowhow of sidequests - how much direction do you want?
[0:04:32] <WUFFLEBEAM_PRIME> @stormhawk9891 ooooooh myyy gaawwwd
[0:04:34] <%Lion_kun> Episode 100 easy
[0:04:36] <Blank9> Yeah game is too big to show everything and keep interest the whole time.
[0:04:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @Menitta I found dog heaven
[0:04:42] <+Jaromero435> maybe, each time you find a mini dungeon ask the chat if it would be fine to leave it for offscreen?
[0:04:46] <+DatAsuna> fans copy paste memes, as always
[0:04:48] <@Menitta> I SAW IT TOO
[0:04:52] <rommlll> game
[0:04:54] <+kewlmyc> 40 hours in, and I just finished the first zone. It's a 150 hour game.
[0:04:54] <rommlll> big
[0:04:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> how many streams until Woolie finds T***** P***?
[0:04:59] <+trackles_64> easily more than 500 hours
[0:05:07] <velgaduere> okay but episode 2000 might be real tho
[0:05:09] <+Nekros4442> @jaromero435 i mean...probably none? They mostly all have unique bosses
[0:05:10] <FrostedZaibatsu> Im like 37 hours in. Boy there is a shit ton more
[0:05:23] <@Menitta> This game is...maaaassive
[0:05:24] <leith_aziz> You can try making it an Elden Ring only month. Likely the best time for the compared to pushing it to later
[0:05:30] <toulon_somberjade> That's Plague's goal
[0:05:36] <Anidem1714> I missed the wolf cave in the first zone!
[0:05:36] <+abrupt_abe> All those hours are very good
[0:05:39] <%Indigo_Automaton> BIG SOULS
[0:05:40] <majindusto> Lets go 5000  episodes!!! lol
[0:05:42] <karawra> wow
[0:05:45] <+Javaa01> Even when you see beyond the horizon, there's still three more horizons to see
[0:05:45] <megaman_sentinel> this game is massive
[0:05:46] <%Lion_kun> And that is Pat
[0:05:46] <leith_aziz> But there's also the risk of audience fatigue cohhHmm
[0:05:47] <+slimefancypants> Theres just alot to do lol
[0:05:50] <BlackermanZX> oh this thing is massive
[0:05:53] <%Lion_kun> Woolie is 5 times slower
[0:05:58] <total_overkill> Forever Ring!
[0:06:00] <+theoldone001> I feel like I've barely touched the game and I only have 2 Elden Runes. Half the map is still undiscovered lol. 60 hours in.
[0:06:04] <+trackles_64> limits of human time
[0:06:05] <$burgersama_dlx> do the thing that is fun
[0:06:06] <+Dova573> What I realize from this is that after this game From CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT
[0:06:15] <+DatAsuna> this is just an issue of the channel format vs any big open world game, same as death stranding and tsushima
[0:06:25] <Blank9> It‚Äôs more game than hollow knight
[0:06:25] <+Dova573> Go makes armored core or something completelly diffferent
[0:06:36] <leith_aziz> @Dova573 I thought Sekiro and Bloodborne made that clear already? cohhHmm
[0:06:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> take your time to soak this shit in
[0:06:45] <@Menitta> that's super doable
[0:07:01] <+Grayhammatter> oh, that sounds nice
[0:07:02] <%Lion_kun> Those clips will be hours long
[0:07:03] <%thesickestzak> That sounds like a good plan
[0:07:07] <+trackles_64> THERES LOTS OF MOMEMENTS
[0:07:10] <+Dova573> @leith_aziz I meant in the sense I cant ask them for anything anymore
[0:07:11] <%khalcipher> everything is pogress
[0:07:13] <secret_npc> I'm more looking forward to the podcast talk anyway
[0:07:15] <Blank9> Good plan
[0:07:16] <+vaderxyz1970> Scrape Area 1 then farm area 1 for skill
[0:07:18] <kadjah> Which has the bigger world/map Death Stranding or  Elden Ring?
[0:07:18] <+slimefancypants> Eh more than fine tbh
[0:07:21] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpGood
[0:07:27] <+Dova573> I wont be asking for BB2 or sekiro 2 etc
[0:07:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> "so I played for 4 hours off stream and was bombarded with bullshit the entire time"
[0:07:28] <majindusto> SNAILBORNE LIVES ON!
[0:07:31] <%Lion_kun> Elden Ring easily
[0:07:32] <+trackles_64> it just never ends
[0:07:35] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[0:07:36] <%livlinn> forgottenLiger
[0:07:43] <+DatAsuna> It's less progress so much as just stuff you missed but yeah
[0:07:44] <+theoldone001> Limgrave is still full of shit I missed, never mind the other areas
[0:07:54] <%Exiliator> Why not stream it when you play it by youself as well then?
[0:08:02] <%Tadashi047> progress offline and talk about cool stuff you found
[0:08:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[0:08:07] <@Menitta> nah Death Stranding is bigger. There's just more noteworthy stuff in Elden Ring
[0:08:08] <leith_aziz> I think that's maybe the first I've ever heard of something like that in an open world setting. cohhNotes
[0:08:12] <%Lion_kun> I am following 7 different play throughs and still find stuff I missed
[0:08:20] <+Nekros4442> Woolie....there are so many fucking bosses that you can just walk into
[0:08:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's a good way to go about it
[0:08:25] <%khalcipher> Try it ad feel how is it going, it could work
[0:08:25] <+trackles_64> Stormveil castles has an entire underground section i dont know how to get to its fuckd
[0:08:31] <+Nekros4442> its insane how dense the game is
[0:08:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yea
[0:08:34] <Blank9> I‚Äôve had friends who played for 3 hours show me more than 4 major things I missed in the starter zone, it‚Äôs insane.
[0:08:38] <deviljhojho_> this game is fucking beefy
[0:08:40] <karawra> it sounds good the game is just huge
[0:08:46] <+dearghostss> i think it's a good compromise
[0:08:51] <%ArtemisCroc> it's the only way to LP the game the way you record
[0:08:54] <alroy909> its the best you can do i think
[0:08:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> just stream non stop for the next month
[0:08:55] <%Reveresao> Yeah, that's fine focus on dungeon, bosses, etc on cam and do open-world stuff off cam
[0:08:56] <listopat> satisfying compromise imo
[0:08:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's the best you can do with a game like this
[0:09:04] <sirrice77> To be honest the majority of side content is a little repetitive so its no big deal to not show it
[0:09:04] <%Shad0wTag> Woolz, I trust your judgement, you have always tired your best to be reasonable so I'm with you
[0:09:08] <deviljhojho_> it goes from open sandbox to quick sand box
[0:09:08] <%holydeviant1> Like, I could give you a list of places to avoid until streams but that sorta beats the point, dont it
[0:09:10] <%therustystream> gotta do what you gotta do
[0:09:12] <+trackles_64> THis game is better than ocarina of time
[0:09:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> I'd say that Caves/Mines/Catacombs are fine for offline play. Most of them are somewhat similar. Sorta like the BB chalice dungeons
[0:09:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I found an area last night that I just was overwhelmed with how big i thought this game was
[0:09:14] <%Lion_kun> New zones will be first time reaction though right?
[0:09:19] <toulon_somberjade> One thing I love about ER's ashes of war system: freely switching between weapon affinity types without having to grind their +s again
[0:09:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:09:23] <%Shad0wTag> Its your channel and at the end of the day I think this is super reasonable
[0:09:26] <+theoldone001> @trackles_64 from Godrick's grace point there's a spot you can jump off from after the courtyard with all the enemies. Look around there for somewhere to drop down from.
[0:09:27] <+Nekros4442> I hope it helps. But i feel itll be like running through a minefield. But i understand you dont want to be super behind on this one
[0:09:29] <@Menitta> It's....massive. I really hope people don't go insane with "NO YOU MISSED A THING" because there's A LOT OF STUFF
[0:09:31] <iacus_> yeah do it at your pace. if people wanted to follow other playthroughs they would anyway
[0:09:36] <+WanderTasogare> yeye, this game is a whole different sorta beast for uploading
[0:09:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Menitta judging by Pat's streams, they will
[0:09:57] <%therustystream> or you can stream 100 hours a week for a month
[0:09:58] <+trackles_64> @theoldone001 iam not talking about the crypt, theres a place further down from that under the castle
[0:10:00] <%therustystream> what could go wrong
[0:10:01] <kadjah> @reallybigrocks lol
[0:10:08] <%Shad0wTag> Super understandable!
[0:10:11] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sounds good woolieFUN
[0:10:16] <%Collieburr> what'd i miss?
[0:10:18] <leomuratore> Absolutely! Do your thing, woolie
[0:10:19] <%thesickestzak> It‚Äôll be fun to hear the stories and then try to find the stuff for myself
[0:10:21] <%therustystream> lol godspeed woolie
[0:10:32] <jvilly96> 60 hours in and keep finding new shit lol 3 cutscenes bosses
[0:10:32] <+sewermonk> woolden ring
[0:10:34] <defaultname3887> just do a 20 hours elden stream /s
[0:10:38] <Wahrow> 24h stream let's go Woolie, haha
[0:10:42] <Gelphaze> How about NO!
[0:10:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> "Did you fight Scrimblo, Father of Scrunko. he's an optional boss that only spawns if you jump on 8 turtles within 30 seconds"
[0:10:50] <+barrakuta371> Pat's trying to do that, but it's pushing it
[0:10:53] <velgaduere> Get Into Elden Ring
[0:10:56] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:10:59] <%DkLordG> Elden Ring subathon
[0:11:01] <%DkLordG> jk
[0:11:03] <%thesickestzak> Simply always be streaming Woolie 4Head
[0:11:05] <+WanderTasogare> haha
[0:11:05] <FrostedZaibatsu> Just run to the final boss like BOTW
[0:11:10] <crackedhappiness> also rollback in P5U was conferme
[0:11:13] <%plsunbanmyacc> is sidequest stuff gonna be avoided?
[0:11:14] <toulon_somberjade> Yeah the Mandatory bosses I think should be treated like Genichro: you're expected to explore and fight though the optional areas first to gain strength and learn the system before trying the ones that don't pull punches
[0:11:15] <+theoldone001> So the Woolie anime has no filler??
[0:11:16] <leith_aziz> Asking Woolie not to miss a single boss in ER is like asking me to do every single Witcher 3 sidequest. They're great, but I will end up missing some. There's so many cohhO
[0:11:22] <Blank9> You dod kirby lore, now is the time to be pigeonholed into elden ring lore forever
[0:11:30] <ToxInjection> Just become a fuckIng Vtuber, bro. Vtubers are the future apparently
[0:11:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> and so it begins LUL
[0:11:43] <+Nekros4442> probably want to make it clear h9w much direction if any you want from chat. I know theres people just edging trying to get you to a weapon
[0:11:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> if you wanna see something cool, play the game and go literally anywhere
[0:11:54] <%thesickestzak> thesickestzak is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 16 in the channel!

[0:11:57] <%Ashen__> Ashen__ subscribed with Prime. 
[0:12:03] <+kewlmyc> Not sure if Woolie wants any actual hints at stuff, but whatever
[0:12:21] <ToxInjection> hype pog VoHiYo
[0:12:29] <%GrandpaJaji> I just assume most people dont want em unless stated otherwise, much easier
[0:12:35] <+trackles_64> Summoning sucks right now
[0:12:38] <+JustToWatch> as long as someone explains the 48 step process of finding Scrimblo we're good
[0:12:47] <%therustystream> the KOF XV PC stuff is so bizzare
[0:12:47] <@Menitta> it's pointless for hints. for every one thing you see there's probably like 4
[0:12:52] <Blank9> A gameplay mechanic tip that‚Äôd be good to pass on is crouching and r1 gives you roll attack without having to roll.
[0:12:55] <@Menitta> things you miss
[0:12:56] <%therustystream> I had to fuck with Nvida control panel shit to get mine to work
[0:12:57] <%thesickestzak> Yeah, I‚Äôd only give advice if the person asks
[0:13:01] <%townzzzzz> we are settings fighers
[0:13:04] <Astrophizz> worse than Mortal Kombat X?
[0:13:16] <leith_aziz> If Woolie knows anything about WB games on PC at launch, then no
[0:13:16] <%specters_art88> specters_art88 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! The game is grindy as hell so doing that off screen is the best. I think you‚Äôll be pretty safe if you stick to that plan.
[0:13:29] <toulon_somberjade> I've played PC  ER last night still suttering frame rates but I'm used to them
[0:13:31] <leith_aziz> WB games on PC somehow almost start unplayable
[0:13:37] <+Brassnarwhal> elden ring ad on the elden ring stream I'm watching while playing elden ring, sick
[0:13:46] <+mechslayer71> elden ring on PC is fine for me, not many issues
[0:13:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> it works fine for me Kappa
[0:13:49] <@Menitta> I got Elden Ring on PC and fortunately I have had very little issues but I never wanna get games on PC for the foreseeable future
[0:13:52] <leith_aziz> Cool cohhPog
[0:13:55] <%BigBruthaThunda> chat advice should be restricted to typing in the same format as the in-game messages LUL

[0:14:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O mobile lab
[0:14:48] <leith_aziz> Im not really suprised about P4AU rollback because BB Tag already has some characters from P4AU, so some work on the rollback would already have been worked on cohhNotes
[0:14:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's high tech
[0:14:52] <%therustystream> @AlteisenReiseZ that shit is so depressing
[0:14:52] <ToxInjection> vita means life BibleThump

[0:15:37] <leith_aziz> Uni fans: wait, you guys are getting support? cohhM

[0:15:59] <Blank9> Yahaha, you‚Äôve found another gold rune 1
[0:16:02] <%BigBruthaThunda> :(
[0:16:03] <skagtheprinceofhell> They have illusionary floors! Physically he won't be able to turn every leaf hard enough!
[0:16:08] <+Arnoldoaad1> I have a magic build and it took me 25-30h to find the magic teacher BibleThump, this game is huge
[0:16:08] <+DatAsuna> It's not a unique problem to be fair, overthinking is something a lot of players do
[0:16:15] <+mechslayer71> do they know how to see the location of maps in the unrevealed portions of the map?
[0:16:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:16:30] <@Solidus_113> i don't think so
[0:16:33] <%livlinn> psaGoblin
[0:16:42] <leith_aziz> I can relate with that
[0:16:42] <megaman_sentinel> I found the magic teacher then forgot where I found her
[0:16:45] <xxHungryxx> Sup chat, how long have they been streaming?
[0:16:47] <leith_aziz> cohhNotes cohhNotes cohhNotes
[0:16:52] <emptyantics> I had to unsub from alot of youtubers because they would post spoilers in their thumbnails
[0:16:53] <iacus_> !uptime
[0:16:53] <@Moobot> @iacus_ WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 32 minutes
[0:16:54] <%hax_metatron> TBH THIS GAME rewards meandering
[0:16:59] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:17:01] <leith_aziz> @megaman_sentinel 10 minutes
[0:17:03] <+ScatFace> that type of playstyle is actually a joy to watch in this game
[0:17:05] <kadjah> Snail
[0:17:05] <+sewermonk> honestly one of my favorite things to do in the game so far is literally just slow walk along paths looking at scenery
[0:17:07] <emptyantics> SNAIL DOWN
[0:17:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> this game is all about meandering tbh, but it's tough with the time slot
[0:17:13] <%thesickestzak> Dog
[0:17:14] <+kewlmyc> To be fair, this is a game that WANTS you to explore everything
[0:17:14] <+Jaromero435> tbf I did find a snail in Elden Ring
[0:17:15] <%slipdog> FGC/souls overlap people, i just found out dodge rolls have negative edge and im pogged up
[0:17:17] <majindusto> S N A I L
[0:17:21] <crackedhappiness> least your not maidenless
[0:17:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> also, though, no matter how thorough you are you WILL miss stuff so just do what's most comfortable
[0:17:22] <%livlinn> woolieFROG
[0:17:24] <@Menitta> I used to overthink a ton and worry about the consequences of my own actions. Now that I got into TTRPGs, I learned to just let the dominoes fall.
[0:17:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> @emptyantics I mean, that doesn't really help any when the data is already in your Youtube
[0:17:29] <majindusto> lol
[0:17:39] <ToxInjection> progress harder Woolie. The Vutubers are faster than you Kappa
[0:17:45] <@Solidus_113> accept in your heart
[0:17:46] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> most of us are here to watch you genuinely just explore and enjoy the game as you, woolie
[0:17:57] <emptyantics> @skagtheprinceofhell Yeah but any bit of avoiding spoilers will help
[0:17:59] <+Chimeraelite> I like escargot
[0:18:03] <deviljhojho_> its amazing how so many people missed essential stuff by getting just a bit distracted. Like me tomatoPunished
[0:18:03] <xxHungryxx> There's a lot in this game to say the least
[0:18:03] <+Jiggisnipe> just have 2 save files Kappa
[0:18:04] <%slipdog> +2 for Meandering WoolieVersus
[0:18:05] <Blank9> I‚Äôve wandered too much and have no idea what progress even is, it‚Äôs great
[0:18:05] <megaman_sentinel> I have a stroll I have to give to her but I can't remember where she's at
[0:18:06] <%thesickestzak> This game is made for S N A I L. But I get how that makes for a less enjoyable watch for people
[0:18:12] <%ozzrabbit> Just wait until Woolie sees the snails in this game‚Ä¶
[0:18:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> just remember, in any area there's a lot of stuff that's probably 20-30 levels higher than you
[0:18:13] <%Shad0wTag> OG's here will respect you respecting our time @WoolieVersus
[0:18:16] <majindusto> Become  as Snail
[0:18:17] <%plsunbanmyacc> so i did a little farming
[0:18:17] <leith_aziz> Me who wanders around all the time in Hollow Knight trying to figure out what I missed: cohhM

[0:18:21] <BlackermanZX> gotta Minh Max
[0:18:21] <%crybirb> You can't powelevel or break the build, believe me I'm 50 hours in

[0:18:46] <+Chimeraelite> Can confirm, power leveling will not save you from some of these fucks
[0:18:46] <+OrangeMDT> Sorry bout that Woolie. I like the snail jokes, but I didn‚Äôt think it was anything more than a lighthearted comment
[0:18:47] <%Indigo_Automaton> Honestly, just exploring the world will level you up, I've done very little grinding but have just been thorough with exploring and I end up too strong for some enocunters
[0:18:47] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> theres so many streams out there, just play the way that feels fun for you

[0:22:51] <leith_aziz> First step for me to get into Anime is to get back into JoJo pickyYareYare
[0:22:52] <hdroark134> the original makers of shingeki no kyojin
[0:22:53] <+TheMilkiestShake> It's sad when you realise half an anime episode ends up being unfunny bullshit most of the time

[0:23:22] <%MajorCrasher> God of high school was bas
[0:23:23] <%baka_sugoi> its okay
[0:23:25] <+pupil31> LUL
[0:23:25] <%Archmortal> God of Highschool is exactly as well-animated as the Webtoon is coherent.
[0:23:25] <%Shad0wTag> Bombed
[0:23:26] <+Akizea> bad adaptation
[0:23:28] <Afrosamasenpai> Animates super hell
[0:23:29] <@Menitta> noooo
[0:23:29] <BlackermanZX> God of highscool was a while ago and it bombed LUL
[0:23:29] <+Kyma1020> Rushed
[0:23:30] <+Jaromero435> Cool fights, wack story
[0:23:30] <%Deasmeister> cool fights that's it
[0:23:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:23:31] <+kewlmyc> First few episodes were great, but fighting was all it had
[0:23:32] <Ramasama13> the fights look cool apparently
[0:23:34] <%Shad0wTag> Great animation tho
[0:23:34] <%jinking79> to many fucking characters
[0:23:36] <majindusto> BOMBA
[0:23:36] <+barrakuta371> God of High School? It Started good, but started to go downhill midway
[0:23:38] <Afrosamasenpai> animations go brr
[0:23:40] <deviljhojho_> they cant all be winners
[0:23:41] <+Arnoldoaad1> fights were good
[0:23:42] <%Shad0wTag> Super sick animation
[0:23:42] <BlackermanZX> rushed as fuck
[0:23:43] <%Exiliator> Looked good at first, had the depth of a puddle
[0:23:44] <+rusell4> Watch Jujutsu Kaisen
[0:23:44] <skagtheprinceofhell> Based on popular Korean Manwha and bombed cause shit just happened.
[0:23:45] <$burgersama_dlx> that is all it was lmao
[0:23:46] <+slimefancypants> VERY stylish but very bad adaptation
[0:23:48] <Shiibbae> Good animation and choreo kinda rushed story
[0:23:48] <%Shad0wTag> All the money went to the animation
[0:23:48] <+Jaromero435> Good if you want to see some fights
[0:23:48] <%Bread_Assassin> Fell off hard in the second half.
[0:23:49] <+TheMilkiestShake> Perfect Blues anniversary the other day
[0:23:50] <%thesickestzak> God of High School was nuts. But they rushed it so much. They did like 115 chapters in like 13 episodes right?
[0:23:51] <NoirEvans> It looked nice but nothing besides that
[0:23:53] <ToxInjection> I stopped caring about God of High School when the magic came in. I just want some fighting shit bro
[0:23:53] <jvilly96> a webtoon manwha just read it its better
[0:23:57] <Shiibbae> Watch jujutsu Kaisen for a better experience
[0:23:59] <xxHungryxx> @woolieversus Ranking of Kings It looks almost like Studio Ghibli
[0:23:59] <BlackermanZX> watch Jujutsu Kaisen instead
[0:23:59] <hdroark134> Osama ranjing is from the original makers of Shingeki no kyojin !!
[0:24:03] <leith_aziz> Woolie's Battle Royale interests were not met
[0:24:05] <secret_npc> "students fighting, could have been interesting"
[0:24:07] <+slimefancypants> AoT anime 1-3
[0:24:09] <$burgersama_dlx> get in that Mob Psycho 100
[0:24:11] <+rusell4> JUJUTSU KAISEN WOOLIE.
[0:24:12] <%jinking79> Shenmue ok
[0:24:13] <%Archmortal> Tower of God has some super interesting animation but it's not what you're looking for, probably
[0:24:13] <+Brassnarwhal> @woolieversus did you watch jujutsu kaisen? it has some of the most beautifully animated fights I've ever seen
[0:24:13] <funny_valintine> So did th first 4 eps
[0:24:14] <NoirEvans> Gotta recomend Chainsaw man
[0:24:14] <thaprinnydood> ranking of kings is GOAT'd
[0:24:14] <+Kyma1020> Witt used to do Aot
[0:24:15] <skagtheprinceofhell> @ToxInjection That was literally in the first episode though
[0:24:17] <%holydeviant1> Fucking MAPPA getting overworked
[0:24:17] <+kewlmyc> WIT Studio did Attack on Titan Season 1-3
[0:24:18] <emptyantics> Demon Slayer is good but it's a shounen so expect ALL the tropes
[0:24:19] <+DatAsuna> WIT is attack on titan 1-3
[0:24:19] <+IAMinJured> guilty crown
[0:24:20] <+abrupt_abe> I'm thst guy just waiting for Chainsaw Man
[0:24:22] <nintega010> @thesickestzak hate when that happens
[0:24:22] <%Deasmeister> Zenitsu by himself made me stop watching demon slayer
[0:24:28] <masterfire23> WIT did AOT early seasons
[0:24:30] <%Shad0wTag> TAX EVASION MONEY BAYBEEE
[0:24:30] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> bomb a head!
[0:24:32] <@Solidus_113> boilerplate shounen
[0:24:34] <%Reveresao> Cool fights, and that's really all it has. I read the comic version years ago, so was not surprised.
[0:24:34] <%Lion_kun> Looks cool, story is meh
[0:24:35] <+slimefancypants> Demon slayer is so pretty for a mid ass shonen
[0:24:41] <+robertoszek> WIT also did Vinland Saga
[0:24:42] <$burgersama_dlx> season 1 demon slayer is a SLOW burn
[0:24:44] <DingusMcBaseball> are you still watching AoT woolie? @WoolieVersus
[0:24:45] <+Kyma1020> Zenitsu?
[0:24:47] <%Archmortal> @Deasmeister yeah he's absolute dogshit just like that grape motherfucker in My Hero
[0:24:48] <leith_aziz> There's so much Anime to get into. I have so many options cohhNotes
[0:24:51] <deviljhojho_> just mute it and watch the animation
[0:24:52] <+kewlmyc> Demon Slayer has some pretty big Shonen ass tropes and asspulls
[0:24:53] <+OrangeMDT> Nah, get into Mushoku Tensei
[0:24:56] <+Nekros4442> theres no Sakura at least
[0:24:56] <xxHungryxx> Vinland saga is pretty good too
[0:24:58] <NoirEvans> Next Season theres gonna be something goated called Chainsaw Man its insane look at it
[0:25:00] <%Lion_kun> DS is super mid but with S rank animation
[0:25:04] <ToxInjection> @skagtheprinceofhell fair. I guess I wasn't as in when we got the dragon stuff. I just prefer to be light on the fantasy stuff
[0:25:05] <BlackermanZX> i got bored with Demon Slayer a lil bir
[0:25:06] <%thesickestzak> Simply move your organs bro
[0:25:07] <@Solidus_113> the formula works sometimes
[0:25:09] <CappuccinoGuil> @Archmortal nah, grape dude is FAR worse. Zenitsu turns around at least
[0:25:13] <Shiibbae> Yknow what chat anime was a mistake
[0:25:15] <%Vextalyst> Inosuke balances out Zenitsu IMO
[0:25:17] <%townzzzzz> daily life of highschool boys still da best
[0:25:19] <$burgersama_dlx> Demon Slayer actually has an ending so that's nice
[0:25:20] <masterfire23> Zenitsu huh?
[0:25:21] <%Lion_kun> Honestly my favorite running anime right now is Princess connect
[0:25:23] <+slimefancypants> Shonen isnt inherently bad, idk why that's such a prevalent thought online
[0:25:25] <+DatAsuna> The only thing I know of demon slayer is gifs and other things referencing it. lol
[0:25:28] <+kewlmyc> @OrangeMDT You really expect Woolie of all people to get into Mushoku Tensei, with it's protaganist? LUL
[0:25:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> @ToxInjection It was normal martial arts magic stuff for a Chinese kung fu movie.
[0:25:33] <DSD24> Reset the clock!
[0:25:36] <@Solidus_113> how many power ups does your MC get
[0:25:38] <DSD24> Naruto talk
[0:25:39] <BlackermanZX> JJK season 2 can't come faster
[0:25:39] <emptyantics> NEVER READ Oyasumi Pun Pun, shit will due soul damage NotLikeThis
[0:25:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Just finished Haikkyuu a few weeks ago.  What a good show.
[0:25:44] <+Arnoldoaad1> I want to say that next season will be much much better and season 8 will probably be the end
[0:25:48] <%Archmortal> @CappuccinoGuil true, but I wish his personality turned around as hard as his inferiority complex did
[0:25:48] <+Brassnarwhal> if you want demon slayer as a high tier anime watch jujutsu, similar feel but much more interesting imo
[0:25:49] <+DatAsuna> multiple things have done naruto vs sasuke better now
[0:25:54] <+ScatFace> ranking of kings is the only anime I'm watching right now
[0:25:55] <emptyantics> CANT WAIT FOR CHAINSAW MAN BABY
[0:25:55] <%Deasmeister> @archmortal at least mineta isn't around for most of it when Zenitsu was creeping on young girls I was like aight I'm out
[0:26:01] <PlumpPotatoRump> @emptyantics its really fucking good xD but hella stressful and bittersweet
[0:26:01] <agustorm123> Shingeki thooo
[0:26:05] <+ScatFace> it's real good, Reggie made a good decision
[0:26:06] <%Plesin> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:26:06] <NoirEvans> Did yall ever hear of Chainsawman @WoolieVersus ?
[0:26:07] <+TheMilkiestShake> So much anime just ends up being annoying I find. So often just the same character types acting the same.
[0:26:09] <+rusell4> When is season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen?
[0:26:09] <@Menitta> Boruto's Dad
[0:26:11] <xxHungryxx> Burrito
[0:26:20] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Solidus_113 Naruto didn't really get all that many upgrades honestly. He knows like... 3 things and used new version of those things pretty much
[0:26:20] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:26:23] <leith_aziz> I dont know much about Naruto, but what people seem to dislike about the show was that it basically went 180 on its themes and message as it went on. cohhHmm
[0:26:25] <+vaderxyz1970> Does Boruto have another son?
[0:26:30] <BlackermanZX> the only saving grace of Burrito is Kawaki tbh
[0:26:32] <%Lion_kun> Boruto went to shit since Kishimoto took over
[0:26:33] <+Brassnarwhal> @rusell4 i think they are doing the prequel movie first
[0:26:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @Archmortal what do you mean? It does. The fact he fought against a demon not just to protect, but to stand up for a girl who was hurt shows he had growth in personality.
[0:26:41] <%baka_sugoi> They did that for Inital d
[0:26:51] <+RegularCore> Boruto's dad
[0:26:54] <+slimefancypants> Initial D story is actually good though lol
[0:26:56] <+Dubstepgamerx> hey everyone
[0:26:57] <emptyantics> I'm calling it now that Chainsaw Man will be as big as EVA
[0:27:03] <@Solidus_113> @skagtheprinceofhell what are you talking about every tail is a new power up, plus sage, plus every rasengan type
[0:27:04] <+Dova573> I cant care for the cool fights
[0:27:10] <@Menitta> you watch initial D for the drama tho
[0:27:10] <+RegularCore> Sasuke with a badman shirt LUL
[0:27:15] <%Archmortal> @CappuccinoGuil if we're only talking about the anime then I guess it hasn't gotten to the part where he never stops creeping
[0:27:16] <+DatAsuna> chainsaw man will never be that big, but it is good
[0:27:21] <+Kyma1020> Man who'd thought Boruto's dad would be such a deadbeat
[0:27:22] <Shiibbae> MOON NINJAS?????????
[0:27:25] <deviljhojho_> holy shit he did a reverse ransenguko mastersan with an implicit sage twist
[0:27:35] <deviljhojho_> using his conquerors mega haki? damn
[0:27:37] <BlackermanZX> more like Moon Aliens
[0:27:38] <nintega010> Why I watch/read One Piece
[0:27:40] <+vaderxyz1970> What are the Geopolitical ramifications of space travel in Naruto
[0:27:45] <+slimefancypants> Powerups are totally fine if the progression is believable.
[0:27:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @Archmortal I'm super lost, as far as I know from the anime, he has totally stopped creeping.
[0:27:50] <@Menitta> I haven't watched anime in a while. think the last thing I watched was MHA 2nd movie.
[0:27:50] <%Mathochism> @datasuna I think ChainsawMan might just blow up Jojo-style. It has the right energy.
[0:27:55] <+ScatFace> woolie's weebness leveled down since his peak Naruto days
[0:27:55] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Solidus_113 Sage was just upgrade to frog stuff, Tail stuff was... always there which is where shadow clones came from and then rasangan. They combine that shit
[0:28:01] <leith_aziz> I'm not the type of guy who tries to adjust to focus on one aspect of something if that's how I'm suppoused to enjoy it. I try to see if I can enjoy what it's going for cohhHmm
[0:28:02] <+RegularCore> How does naruto work why are there ninjas?
[0:28:04] <@Menitta> need to catch up on JoJo
[0:28:17] <+legendofswagda> 131 IIRC
[0:28:18] <iacus_> drop the budget is immediately understandable
[0:28:23] <%andre11dr> It is budget tho
[0:28:23] <+RegularCore> @menitta  wait till march for part 6
[0:28:25] <deviljhojho_> in naruto lore ninjas killed all the samurai and became the dominant species
[0:28:26] <%Shad0wTag> 135
[0:28:29] <deviljhojho_> its in the wiki
[0:28:32] <leith_aziz> If teh mindset is like: "Ignore the character and story, stay for the action and animation", then I can't do that. cohhNotes
[0:28:35] <%jinking79> shit when is Part 6 season 2 coming out
[0:28:39] <Kofvscapcom> new Teppen set out today too
[0:28:41] <skagtheprinceofhell> Well no, the samurai are still there.
[0:28:44] <+RegularCore> @deviljhojho_  what?
[0:28:47] <+Kyma1020> The fight where Sauske got punched in the teeth
[0:28:50] <%Archmortal> @CappuccinoGuil they tone it down significantly, in the manga it goes from constant orbiter begging to like, a quick cut version where he gets shut down instantly
[0:28:51] <deviljhojho_> @RegularCore yeah man like
[0:28:53] <%Vextalyst> ooooohhhh
[0:28:56] <iacus_> oh lol momty oum
[0:28:56] <%Shad0wTag> OH YEAH
[0:28:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @leith_aziz sometimes the story just isn't worth it tbh
[0:29:00] <+TheLastStar> RIP
[0:29:00] <skagtheprinceofhell> Just they are in there own place chilling
[0:29:01] <DSD24> Dead Fantasy too
[0:29:01] <%Vextalyst> I loved Dead Fantasy
[0:29:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Man, RIP Monty
[0:29:03] <deviljhojho_> ninjas and samurai were like rival species
[0:29:03] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[0:29:04] <BlackermanZX> and thats why ya watch One Piece instead kolOPWA

[0:29:08] <+sewermonk> RvB fights were fuckin sick
[0:29:08] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @DSD24
[0:29:09] <+DatAsuna> The best fight scenes are also story at the same time, without stopping to pause for monologuing
[0:29:11] <mr_saturday93> RIP Monty
[0:29:11] <%townzzzzz> gametrailers.....
[0:29:12] <skagtheprinceofhell> Dead Fantasy was with Rooster Teeth wasn't it?
[0:29:12] <+robertoszek> @Mathochism I don't know about that but Kobeni's car definitely will
[0:29:15] <deviljhojho_> and ninjas won because they had actual magic and samurai just had shitty swords
[0:29:16] <majindusto> Monty  :(
[0:29:21] <DSD24> Woops that was my bad
[0:29:21] <+DatAsuna> dead fantasy was pre RT
[0:29:26] <+ScatFace> MasterChef is a girl
[0:29:30] <ToxInjection> BibleThump
[0:29:37] <mr_saturday93> I wouldn't recommend RWBY
[0:29:38] <iacus_> videogame girls falling off VERY tall towers
[0:29:39] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> BibleThump
[0:29:42] <emptyantics> DONT FORGET ABOUT ROAD
[0:29:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Honestly Seasons 1-3 of RWBY was shlock, but damn the fights
[0:29:45] <+rusell4> Super Mario Bros
[0:29:47] <+Dova573> I get what you mean, I kinda like being invested in the characters that have cool fights
[0:29:47] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> dead fantasy was awesome
[0:29:51] <skagtheprinceofhell> @deviljhojho_ Well, they could do shit with the swords, it's just not as advance
[0:29:56] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz I can't do that man. I'll adjust my taste if I gotta, but I cant just ignore an entire "section" if it's a focus doodOuch
[0:30:00] <+Akizea> SMBZ
[0:30:00] <emptyantics> YEAH
[0:30:01] <skagtheprinceofhell> Road?
[0:30:02] <+Kyma1020> Have you seen Megalobox Nomad?
[0:30:06] <NoirEvans> @WoolieVersus Ever heard of Chainsawman?
[0:30:06] <+slimefancypants> Just read manga, its way better in general tbh lol
[0:30:06] <deviljhojho_> @skagtheprinceofhell shoulda gone for the meta build
[0:30:14] <%TheHateFish> @mr_saturday93 RWBY is good if you watch the trailers and the fights.
[0:30:19] <%TheHateFish> And nothing else
[0:30:21] <emptyantics> RIP Monty
[0:30:23] <ToxInjection> wait stop I'm actually sad now
[0:30:30] <%Archmortal> if you want some drama with your eye-catching animation definitely check out Tower of God.  Its style is completely different than other stuff these days
[0:30:32] <deviljhojho_> megaloblox
[0:30:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg

[0:30:37] <+TheLastStar> OMG WATCH IT
[0:30:38] <%CisealNine> MegaRoblox.
[0:30:39] <skagtheprinceofhell> @deviljhojho_ That WAS the meta build. Then the new update came out to shake up the meta
[0:30:42] <ct_2> Nomad megalo box is so much better
[0:30:42] <+slimefancypants> Megalobox season 2 was real good!!!
[0:30:43] <+kewlmyc> Woolie is growing up
[0:30:43] <+sewermonk> theres too much good stuff now
[0:30:45] <CappuccinoGuil> @Archmortal ah gotcha. Yeah, basically after the spider clan fight, he basically just whines, but doesn't creep on girls, even during the Entertainment District Arc
[0:30:46] <+rusell4> JJK DAMMIT
[0:30:46] <+RushUnplugged> MB Nomad is even better
[0:30:48] <+zanz_san> no has time
[0:30:51] <+TheLastStar> Megalo Box season 2 is good
[0:30:54] <%DkLordG> Woolie and the Anime Man have the same watch volume currently lol
[0:30:54] <%Shad0wTag> Woolie has seen Megalobox boys
[0:30:55] <skagtheprinceofhell> He probably won't liek Chainsaw Man at all
[0:30:57] <+Dova573> Chainssawman is not out yet
[0:31:00] <+tsamxxx> baki is the only anime that exists
[0:31:02] <+DatAsuna> many good things not enough time
[0:31:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Woolie have you seen DEATH NOTE
[0:31:07] <+RegularCore> Chainsaw man is a romantic comedy
[0:31:11] <masterfire23> odd taxi and mushoku tensei
[0:31:14] <xxHungryxx> Megalobox is that boxing anime, yeah?
[0:31:15] <deviljhojho_> @skagtheprinceofhell the real meta is always 5 seconds old at all times tomatoCool
[0:31:18] <%xerotwo> Chainsaw man is soo good lol
[0:31:19] <+DatAsuna> don't go back to clone wars it ain't worth 7 seasons. lol
[0:31:19] <emptyantics> People are assholes
[0:31:23] <%thesickestzak> Roblox?!
[0:31:28] <+TheLastStar> @xxHungryxx yup
[0:31:29] <agustorm123> Don‚Äôt do it
[0:31:30] <+rusell4> SAMURAI FLAMENCO
[0:31:31] <+kewlmyc> People suck ass
[0:31:33] <copametic> steam forums are filled with dipshits
[0:31:35] <+RushUnplugged> lol steam forums, the most 13yo of forums
[0:31:37] <+pupil31> JUST SAY IT
[0:31:41] <%Collieburr> Woolsworth needs to get rid of that yee yee ass helmet asap
[0:31:43] <emptyantics> @xerotwo Can't wait to see it animated and when we get to THE SCENE it'll be incredible
[0:31:45] <skagtheprinceofhell> You mean literally all forums?
[0:31:46] <%townzzzzz> where's teh pompadour hair
[0:31:47] <Afrosamasenpai> JUST SAY YOU RACIST
[0:31:48] <+tsamxxx> im just a historical race realist
[0:31:51] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah, ive been trying to talk about having black representation in video games for like 10 years. Its all the fucking same
[0:31:53] <%Archmortal> Lost Ark, a game from fucking 2014 or whatever, has better options for that than brand new games now
[0:31:55] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atp0in20
[0:31:55] <skagtheprinceofhell> It isn't.
[0:31:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> There's literally samurais
[0:31:56] <+mechslayer71> is that the argument they used tho?
[0:31:57] <Astrophizz> with samurais lol
[0:31:57] <%andre11dr> It's a simple mindset "what is not me is scary, and i must defend against it"
[0:31:58] <+DatAsuna> nordic samurai real
[0:31:58] <DSD24> Oh god...
[0:31:58] <ToxInjection> it was immediate
[0:32:00] <+toomuchsnarf> @rusell4  that's a name I haven't heard in a long time man that shit was awesome
[0:32:00] <+slimefancypants> yeah thats such stupid justification
[0:32:02] <deviljhojho_> nordic inspired fantasy but there are straight up japanese people
[0:32:03] <+robertoszek> and samurais
[0:32:04] <+RegularCore> Being black on the internet:  expect racism from nerds
[0:32:04] <+kewlmyc> Samurai are cool though
[0:32:05] <iacus_> hmm, I don't think that argument really applies in this case
[0:32:05] <+pectusumbra> there's also souls fans who just refuse to criticize the games in any way.
[0:32:07] <%TheHateFish> @DatAsuna Three seasons of meh for four of good and the sickest Star Wars fight scene ever is pretty worth it in my book
[0:32:08] <TheotherKristian> For a free Ireland
[0:32:10] <+vaderxyz1970> The good old Disco Elysium name plate
[0:32:11] <emptyantics> Say you're a racist without saying you're a racist
[0:32:13] <xxHungryxx> @thelaststar I'll need to check out season 2 then. I enjoyed the first one
[0:32:13] <BlackermanZX> what an elaborate way to say you are racist kolKataLUL
[0:32:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:32:19] <+tsamxxx> now let me tell you about this interesting book called the bell curve
[0:32:21] <%notsoy> lmfaoo
[0:32:21] <leith_aziz> As long as it's rationale, I'll listen. People get defensive for a reason. They happen to love something you critisize cohhHmm
[0:32:22] <%DiscoMatador> lol
[0:32:23] <+trackles_64> Yikes
[0:32:23] <CappuccinoGuil> I am holding out hope they'll add more styles to Elden Ring though. Because you can change mid-game
[0:32:28] <%holydeviant1> look, they put black hair in Animal Crossing and someone got death threats for using them while being white, man, so fuck it
[0:32:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> Because the l;ast time a Japanese dev made a Black hair option Twitter spurgged out at it being racist.
[0:32:32] <xUrbanCarnage> I hope they deleted the game when they met that lady
[0:32:37] <+DatAsuna> @DatAsuna That ahsoka maul fight isn't even a top 5 and those 4 seasons are still 60-70% bad. lol
[0:32:44] <+tsamxxx> alas there are 2 races white and political
[0:32:44] <+TheMilkiestShake> @skagtheprinceofhell Then make it better?
[0:32:45] <%MajorCrasher> @blackermanzx where tf did you get that emote? PogChamp
[0:32:47] <XelanArdel> realism in a fantasy setting will always be the weakest argument
[0:32:48] <iacus_> @BlackermanZX It's a legit argument, just don't feel it applies to Elden Ring in any valid way
[0:32:51] <DSD24> Man that animal crossing shit was awful
[0:32:53] <+DatAsuna> Even season 7 is more than half garbage
[0:32:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Nioh 2 character creator is still goated fr
[0:33:01] <%TheHateFish> @DatAsuna Agree to disagree, then
[0:33:02] <emptyantics> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ amen
[0:33:08] <+0neReeler> that was bamco
[0:33:11] <xxHungryxx> I chose the bowl cut üòè
[0:33:14] <BlackermanZX> @MajorCrasher KingOfLighting kolWESCI kolSLURP kolMagma
[0:33:15] <+Kyma1020> Did Demon Souls remake have better black hair style options?
[0:33:16] <DSD24> Nioh 2 had a amazing character creator, plus Yasuke was cool in it
[0:33:24] <%Vextalyst> but....but the LORE
[0:33:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> @TheMilkiestShake The dev LITERALLY made it based on his friends hairstyle. Actual black people liked it, then others called it racist.
[0:33:34] <+RegularCore> monster hunter black hair
[0:33:35] <jvilly96> A fade would be nice at lease
[0:33:36] <+furtive0ne> People can shoot lightning and fight dragons and come back from death‚Ä¶ but dreadlocks and Afros‚Ä¶ not realistic?
[0:33:37] <%CisealNine> Mods will sort it out... I hope.
[0:33:39] <iacus_> yes
[0:33:41] <+RegularCore> yes
[0:33:43] <leith_aziz> I cant keep up with the fire in chat's discussions, but I dont think I wanna read some takes here cohhM
[0:33:45] <%Archmortal> Can we get Woolie's hair style RIGHT NOW, bandana included
[0:33:45] <emptyantics> Yes
[0:33:46] <+DatAsuna> In esos yes
[0:33:47] <+vaderxyz1970> Yes
[0:33:48] <%thesickestzak> Lots of GAMERS out there
[0:33:49] <+mechslayer71> summerset isles
[0:33:50] <+RegularCore> in the books are
[0:33:51] <+0neReeler> only deebo
[0:33:54] <%holydeviant1> They exist, but they never went to the place.
[0:33:55] <Astrophizz> there's an Africa equivalent
[0:33:58] <%TheHateFish> Not loads outside of Esos, but there's a good few
[0:34:01] <+robertoszek> zerrikania, was it?
[0:34:04] <+RegularCore> there are*
[0:34:09] <+trackles_64> Grey worm?
[0:34:11] <%andre11dr> There is a Africa in GoT

[0:34:28] <+tsamxxx> Was there any black male characters who didnt have their dicks cut off in GoT besides the one merchant who played sampson?
[0:34:33] <%andre11dr> It's just that the story basically takes place in Norway
[0:34:40] <+Marco1877> Aye brothas, how are u guys doing? Yo chat.
[0:34:43] <%Vextalyst> It's against the lore tho. it's fine you can create shrek in elden ring BUT A BLACK GUY? nah
[0:34:58] <deviljhojho_> not even viking dreads
[0:34:59] <%NordiqueJer> NordiqueJer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! NGL guys, watching ER just made we want to play Bloodborne again. Now I'm just racing to finish it alongside the OG LP.
[0:34:59] <leith_aziz> pickyFight
[0:34:59] <%Archmortal> @tsamxxx It's almost like GRRM isn't an exception
[0:35:05] <%thesickestzak> Muh immersion >:(
[0:35:06] <+Kyma1020> Fantasy is fantasy. Everyone should be included
[0:35:06] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> ear options woulda been neat too
[0:35:07] <%townzzzzz> from the lands of reeds
[0:35:08] <%Dcapit8ed> LUL
[0:35:08] <BlackermanZX> you can be literally purple man with a thong in this game
[0:35:11] <skagtheprinceofhell> And then people will call it racist.
[0:35:11] <+0neReeler> but asia tho
[0:35:16] <deviljhojho_> like it straight up has samurai AND three fantasy ethnicities
[0:35:18] <+RegularCore> Also people walk around
[0:35:26] <DSD24> Oh man I remember being so bummed in Soul Calibur 3 where you couldn't even make a black character
[0:35:32] <+pupil31> SPIKE LEE
[0:35:33] <NoirEvans> GoT has a extremely different setting than Elden Ring its really hard to compare
[0:35:35] <+0neReeler> as long as we can make shrek it's ok
[0:35:35] <+vaderxyz1970> Japan is culturally appropriating Japan
[0:35:36] <deviljhojho_> livin da dream
[0:35:38] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> finally got the skin luster right for a dark elf and had to hide the ears under hair
[0:35:38] <karawra> livin da dream a classic
[0:35:39] <+tsamxxx> a spike lee joint
[0:35:39] <%MajorCrasher> does a lack of representation in eldin ring suck, yes. but I don't care that much as someone black personally because fromsoft always phones it in with the character creator. it is the lowest of effort on their part as a whole because it's just not that important to them.
[0:35:40] <iacus_> frequency vibrations
[0:35:41] <+Nekros4442> VIC VAN LIER IN THE DIRT
[0:35:43] <+slimefancypants> like top 3 LP ever
[0:35:44] <%thesickestzak> That was awesome
[0:35:45] <%plsunbanmyacc> i miss freq
[0:35:46] <+TheLastStar> "STORY"
[0:35:50] <DSD24> Vic Van Lier was a punk
[0:35:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat being shocked at the sneaker customization was hilarious
[0:35:53] <+furtive0ne> Remember when Monster Hunter had Black hairstyles?
[0:35:54] <%RyTYoung> Probably my favourite LP LUL
[0:35:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> Thank god that PSO2 has a good CC creator
[0:35:55] <+toomuchsnarf> LIVIN DA DREAM
[0:35:56] <$hattrick61> default name was A-Train
[0:35:57] <xxHungryxx> You can play a Samurai, get the Hook Claws, and be Bushido Wolverine. Let ppl play what they want
[0:36:01] <BlueEagle2395> could have been a oversight, hope they get the message and make more next time
[0:36:02] <%Archmortal> @MajorCrasher This is an interesting take cuz the character creator has improved with every single game
[0:36:07] <leith_aziz> Why was I thinking about Def Jam when Woolie said NBA?
[0:36:08] <megaman_sentinel> nope not at all nope
[0:36:09] <rommlll> good joint
[0:36:12] <%jinking79> Basketball player titled Of Africa
[0:36:13] <+slimefancypants> John Rigatoni! Tony Spaghetti!
[0:36:21] <+TheLastStar> omg its the rage of africa
[0:36:22] <jam_chamoy> ghosts in nba
[0:36:22] <+Arnoldoaad1> remember rage of africa
[0:36:23] <+RegularCore> I saw people making waluigi
[0:36:34] <rommlll> #blackgift
[0:36:35] <%andre11dr> Looking at you Demon's Souls
[0:36:36] <%NordiqueJer> All you really need to be "decent" is three variations on the Afro, the fade and dreads.
[0:36:37] <2deep5u> NBA even had a create-a-sneaker option
[0:36:38] <+EdgySalad> I still remember Woolie & Plague creating a black older woman on Black Desert Online
[0:36:41] <%Shad0wTag> THE DARKEST OF AFRICA
[0:36:52] <JoshuaSXM> after Nagoriuki they ain't got an excuse anymore
[0:36:56] <skagtheprinceofhell> That was with Plauge @EdgySalad ?
[0:36:58] <ToxInjection> it's like proper representation matters or something
[0:37:01] <%Archmortal> this is why RAGE is still necessary
[0:37:03] <%jinking79> game defaulted to black names too LUL
[0:37:05] <%MajorCrasher> @archmortal it has improved visually but it's still not better on a mechanical level. it's still really easy to make abominations and they're still using hairstyles from old games and didn't bother putting in a new one
[0:37:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Straw Fella
[0:37:11] <deviljhojho_> is it really a strawman when its an actual person
[0:37:17] <+DatAsuna> strawman real
[0:37:22] <+EdgySalad> @skagtheprinceofhell I'm pretty sure it was with PlagueofGripes
[0:37:23] <skagtheprinceofhell> @deviljhojho_ Yes. EVEN MORE SO
[0:37:24] <BlueEagle2395> the keyboard warriors
[0:37:25] <leith_aziz> How did we steer this conversation into this? cohhStare
[0:37:30] <iacus_> real life strawmen only exist to make good arguments look bad

[0:38:18] <+kewlmyc> @skagtheprinceofhell Manchildren
[0:38:24] <OblivionSword1> Welcome to me white kids
[0:38:28] <FrostedZaibatsu> Remember when Adam Sessler said he didnt like GTA San Andres, because the main character wasnt white
[0:38:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> Kids can relate easily.
[0:38:29] <%Indigo_Automaton> Man, I really relate to killing demigods and being undead
[0:38:30] <+RegularCore> yup
[0:38:30] <+theoldone001> Is it because they didn't want to, or because black hair is harder to develop?
[0:38:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I wasn't around at the time, but boy it must have been wild with GTA San Andreas
[0:38:39] <ToxInjection> I still struggle sometimes making an Asian character. Situation's not as dire though
[0:38:43] <+DatAsuna> I don't need a character to be me to relate to them, but when it's a custom create a character,, the option is nice.
[0:38:44] <+0neReeler> some people have to self insert
[0:38:46] <tetrabrick1lt> !MOTIVATED
[0:38:47] <@Moobot> @tetrabrick1lt 2525 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:38:47] <%NordiqueJer> Imagine needing to look like someone to relate with them though.
[0:38:50] <skagtheprinceofhell> @theoldone001 All those hair physics.
[0:38:54] <leomuratore> Good stuff, Woolie!
[0:39:00] <skagtheprinceofhell> @NordiqueJer *looks at Twitter*
[0:39:06] <iacus_> People who absolutely NEED to be represented in media in order to enjoy it lack some sort of empathy imo
[0:39:10] <+TheMilkiestShake> Berserk deluxe edition volume 4 says "Guts the fearsome black". It keeps swordsman for the next line and is the only part non capital and not in bold
[0:39:13] <+DatAsuna> honest
[0:39:13] <+mechslayer71> people who self insert are the same lovers who can't appreciate NTR with good art. why do you automatically identify with the guy GETTING chucked? huh, weakling?!
[0:39:16] <%Lion_kun> I am following a bunch of playthroughs and still discovering new things
[0:39:16] <+vaderxyz1970> I don't need to self insert in a story i'm reading / watching / playing for imersion
[0:39:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> once you're like 30-40 hours in the wiki might actually be useful
[0:39:19] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> i live as a middle aged white guy, why would i wanna play one too..
[0:39:20] <skagtheprinceofhell> No, they lack empathy in general.
[0:39:21] <%townzzzzz> play it like MEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:39:24] <Astrophizz> @theoldone001 From has hard a hard time even getting skin color right
[0:39:24] <+mechslayer71> cucked*
[0:39:33] <Shwepie> I honestly don't understand not being able to relate or self-insert just because the avatar looks different.
[0:39:41] <%Lion_kun> I have to keep a mental checklist of shit I missed
[0:39:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're gonna get a lot of people saying "wtf I never saw that and I've played 800 hours"
[0:39:57] <jvilly96> My most annoying gripe with the game is when you attempt to teleport and you put a marker now lol woolieEVIL

[0:40:06] <+DatAsuna> @Shwepie exactly, if anything it just sends a worrying message about that person's capability for empathy lol

[0:41:01] <leomuratore> That's insane
[0:41:04] <%andre11dr> Yeah you can use Excel to edit levels
[0:41:05] <Puhff> Excel?!
[0:41:10] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Characters don‚Äôt need to look like anything like me in order to relate to them
[0:41:11] <+0neReeler> you can code in excel
[0:41:18] <ToxInjection> witchcraft
[0:41:20] <+sewermonk> is Excel Turing complete?

[0:47:07] <skagtheprinceofhell> People literally bought Code Vein just for character creation. So like, just steal that, and put it in everything with a character creator. And boom, fix everything.

[0:47:34] <Shwepie> Is Woolie or Reggie in control?
[0:47:38] <DSD24> I made some great character creators in Code Vein
[0:47:41] <%Lion_kun> This is my favorite Fromsoft theme song
[0:47:41] <%Collieburr> Time to return to the Cheeks Between
[0:47:43] <BlueEagle2395> I wait til the song hits this part to start the game
[0:47:47] <+kirkieCanada> Looks like woolie is assuming direct control
[0:47:48] <+slimefancypants> This theme HITS
[0:47:51] <FrostedZaibatsu> @skagtheprinceofhell Like 3 stories
[0:47:51] <TubbsNK> So do you think Genshin Impact 2 will be like BotW again or will the copy Elden Ring this time?
[0:47:54] <+Dakuu75> This chat is gonna get bitch-slapped with emote-mode so fast. (prove me wrong, chat.)
[0:47:58] <BlackermanZX> man this theme goes hard as fuck for no reason LUL
[0:48:07] <%andre11dr> God, i hate that i decided to restart work right when it started snowing, now I'll have to shovel that shit :(
[0:48:11] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> nah fuck it, go emote mode right out the gate

[0:48:22] <+thedream_c> pc postponed

[0:48:35] <DSD24> Oooo Woolsworth looking different
[0:48:37] <%MajorCrasher> why would there be a Genshin 2? gachas don't do sequels
[0:48:44] <%DkLordG> WAIFU SPOTTED
[0:48:44] <xxHungryxx> Oh, we tossed the Griffith helmet
[0:48:47] <%asakura_ayase> Wife o wife

[0:48:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now who's that sassy lost child sitting on the wall Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:48:56] <+thedream_c> touchin graces
[0:49:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> there are many graces to be touched
[0:49:09] <+thedream_c> seeking maidens
[0:49:09] <+Grayhammatter> touch the graceholes
[0:49:11] <%khalcipher> I dont hace one of those!!!
[0:49:13] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @MajorCrasher id imagine way way later down the line there might be a genshin 2, but maybe it could just be a big update.
[0:49:14] <%andre11dr> Ah yes, the "grace holes"
[0:49:16] <%khalcipher> have*
[0:49:19] <DSD24> Gracehole is a terrible name
[0:49:24] <+benbag13> yo it's zulie the witch!
[0:49:25] <+OrangeMDT> Can‚Äôt wait for Woolie to find the skrimblo gate
[0:49:26] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> grace hooooles
[0:49:32] <megaman_sentinel> I'm using that sword instead of the claymore
[0:49:33] <+Dakuu75> woah, rly?
[0:49:33] <@Solidus_113> that armour is good
[0:49:40] <+thedream_c> heh Godrick aka Megatron
[0:49:40] <BlackermanZX> Age of Empires lookin mf
[0:49:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Godrick the Grafted Kreygasm
[0:49:54] <xxHungryxx> That Brass shield they drop is üëå
[0:49:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I farmed the large knight in that outpost FOR HOURS and he didn't drop his armor WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
[0:49:57] <%khalcipher> ugh I want that armor
[0:50:13] <skagtheprinceofhell> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Desire Sensor.
[0:50:14] <defaultname3887> is there any way to let woolie know reggie is low?
[0:50:14] <+Grayhammatter> damn, got some great poise armor
[0:50:20] <%thesickestzak> Starting to get that Reggie luck
[0:50:31] <iacus_> Still prisoner class?
[0:50:32] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> looks rad
[0:50:38] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ it took me long as fuck too. I think I probably added at least 5-10 extra hours to my playthrough just farming armor and weapon drops so far lol
[0:50:42] <%MajorCrasher> @angel42199 seems doubtful. gachas milk a game until it's dry then make something completely different. I'd be shocked if genshin was any different
[0:50:44] <%khalcipher> What?
[0:50:46] <+thedream_c> lore lore
[0:50:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @skagtheprinceofhell I straight up thought you simply couldn't get that armor and gave up wth
[0:50:47] <+GilroyGoldBlood> They only do it occasionally
[0:50:49] <NoirEvans> Ya gotta explore and re-explore the game
[0:50:49] <Necnill> monkaS
[0:50:52] <%RyTYoung> Uhhh WHAT
[0:50:52] <+Dakuu75> they were alive still???? wut???
[0:50:53] <+GilroyGoldBlood> they're usually quiet for me
[0:50:54] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus All merchants can buy duplicate bits of armor off of you, so if you get stuff like those duplicate greaves, consider those as pocket souls
[0:50:57] <DSD24> They got crossed up?
[0:50:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> take some photos for the collage
[0:51:03] <+Sleepy_Puma> I saw that crucifix shit lmao
[0:51:05] <kes009900> "chilling" yeah, right
[0:51:10] <zhenthrim213> just the scenic crucifications
[0:51:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Can you get those enemies in other areas? Might have better luck that way.
[0:51:14] <thaprinnydood> this game is packed with content
[0:51:17] <xxHungryxx> Degenerates like you belong on a cross
[0:51:20] <+GilroyGoldBlood> other way, you cam from south of the church
[0:51:20] <+dearghostss> i think they only do it at night, but i might be wrong... it's spooky tho
[0:51:24] <%slipdog> Wrong! Sad!
[0:51:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @skagtheprinceofhell yeah, guess I'll try that
[0:51:37] <%andre11dr> I think i played the game in a weird way because I'm 25 hours in and still haven't done Stormveil Castle LUL
[0:51:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:51:38] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @MajorCrasher I mean the thing is some gachas get kinda dated. for example FGO's gameplay and graphics feel pretty dated now. so for that reason alone there would be incentive to make an FGO 2. Again though it could just be made as a big update instead of a new game
[0:51:41] <+Dakuu75> this game is literally "content in ANY direction"
[0:51:43] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Yep, Melina
[0:51:49] <+thedream_c> yeah milena
[0:51:49] <+PatchTheSquid> @WoolieVersus You're upside, you started at the First Step
[0:51:54] <+Javaa01> Not the mortal kombat character
[0:51:54] <TubbsNK> Those giants don't mess around.
[0:52:11] <+GilroyGoldBlood> huh, really
[0:52:12] <agustorm123> Ohh woolie is snailing
[0:52:13] <CappuccinoGuil> That happened to me too
[0:52:19] <+twohitgood> did redoing the character give you FOMO for what else might be missed?
[0:52:20] <+OrangeMDT> Oh no, Woolie is lost with the map
[0:52:23] <tetrabrick1lt> ye ye ye
[0:52:25] <NoirEvans> So its the number of Graces?
[0:52:25] <BlackermanZX> isnt it like the 3rd bonfire or sumthin
[0:52:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Find 3 Graces and sit and she appears
[0:52:37] <%Lion_kun> I have no idea what the requirement for the hub is.
[0:52:39] <%MajorCrasher> @angel42199 it's definitely dated but it still makes money like nobody's business. that's why there is no fgo2 or an update. there's no point to them if it's still making money
[0:52:39] <LoneFonte> 3rd grace found in the overworld
[0:52:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> surprise, it's kinda vague :)
[0:52:49] <fragdar> yo.. whos playing?
[0:52:54] <fragdar> just got here
[0:52:57] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> obtuse souls game is obtuse
[0:52:58] <user_naim> woolz
[0:52:59] <+Grayhammatter> woolz is
[0:52:59] <TubbsNK> Woolie is
[0:53:00] <NoirEvans> @fragdar Woolie
[0:53:02] <skagtheprinceofhell> They got less vague and more vague in the same game.
[0:53:03] <fragdar> thanks
[0:53:03] <BlackermanZX> E-girl cant stay with you tier 3 forevr
[0:53:04] <%Deasmeister> so I did some grinding

[0:53:14] <%hax_metatron> Regular enemies are for maintenance
[0:53:15] <+toomuchsnarf> a bit of grinding off screen
[0:53:15] <thaprinnydood> what class did woolie go?
[0:53:16] <%Lion_kun> People say it is fighting Margit but I never fought him and got invited to the hub
[0:53:19] <%Shad0wTag> @WoolieVersus We trust you
[0:53:20] <%andre11dr> Souls games being vague ?What a shock
[0:53:22] <+GilroyGoldBlood> lmao
[0:53:24] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd

[0:53:36] <+WanderTasogare> oh that character very clearly in berserk
[0:53:36] <%Reveresao> I NEED A ADULT
[0:53:40] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @MajorCrasher Eventually they will lose the revenue stream or notice declines which they were when I was checking. Not the case for genshin just yet. But if there is still potential to make money off the franchise, like Fate, then there is potential for a sequel to revitalize interest. Whether that will happen for genshin is unknown too early to tell
[0:53:44] <+OrangeMDT> Nah, lvl 99 vs margit
[0:53:50] <+benbag13> the prisoner

[0:56:02] <%MutedMimic> sugoiSadguts
[0:56:03] <xxHungryxx> Wolves & Jellyfish are the best starting summon
[0:56:03] <%MajorCrasher> @angel42199 I get what you mean by mobile and gachas in general are a different beast altogether from other games. similarly to mmos, if they're successful they never die no matter how long it's been. until it's not successful and does completely and utterly without possibility of a sequel. they just make a new thing instead. just like Mihoyo made Genshin instead of Honkai Impact 2
[0:56:05] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> aw
[0:56:07] <+sewermonk> thats such a cool design too
[0:56:10] <+0neReeler> this happens every time!

[0:56:21] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:56:25] <+Sleepy_Puma> I love how the animations work in this game when you interact in interactions
[0:56:26] <+sevorai> @CappuccinoGuil I like the dogs for the aggro they pull that lets me bleed the hell outta some bosses
[0:56:29] <+Sleepy_Puma> holding the maidens hand
[0:56:29] <+Grayhammatter> just take this stand, bye
[0:56:32] <+Sleepy_Puma> seeing this witch go

[0:56:48] <+thedream_c> woof woof
[0:56:51] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Yeah, the item sorting is super helpful
[0:56:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> @iacus_ Oh, even fast bosses to.
[0:56:59] <skagtheprinceofhell> Just beef her up.
[0:57:00] <DSD24> @iacus_ I was making jokes I don't know if we actually meet her
[0:57:04] <CappuccinoGuil> @sevorai that's a good thought there. I just found them to be too low on health and die too fast. But they cause WAY more chaos than the imps for sure.
[0:57:05] <emptyantics> best summon
[0:57:09] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @MajorCrasher I do wonder however, if there would be a lot of interest in a genshin 2, when it gets to that point - simply because of people really liking the world and characters. After all, its a very lore focused game.
[0:57:11] <BlackermanZX> thats some JJK shit
[0:57:13] <+Grayhammatter> summon wolves
[0:57:20] <+pectusumbra> It's stand power
[0:57:21] <skagtheprinceofhell> @DSD24 He didn't get the ashes at least. He went to the hub right?
[0:57:26] <+thedream_c> yep draw aggro
[0:57:27] <%hax_metatron> You can level them up too!
[0:57:29] <+thedream_c> big use there
[0:57:29] <+sevorai> @CappuccinoGuil If you upgrade em they are a bit tankier
[0:57:30] <emptyantics> Someone modded it so you can pet them
[0:57:32] <majindusto> HOUND WOLF SQUAD
[0:57:34] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> three wolves within us all
[0:57:37] <+thedream_c> because this games aggro don't  mess around
[0:57:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> ...This game has all of the different sequences.
[0:57:37] <%townzzzzz> wolves hunt packs arisen
[0:57:37] <+Akizea> no there's also npc summons
[0:57:38] <%andre11dr> It's like picking your stand
[0:57:40] <deviljhojho_> WOLFPACK
[0:57:41] <+Akizea> theres both
[0:57:43] <%akajaybay> the gatefront ruins is a good spot to test them out
[0:57:47] <DSD24> @skagtheprinceofhell I'm not sure if he got to the hub yet
[0:57:54] <%Archmortal> Wolfpack best summon, you *cannot* change my mind
[0:57:56] <%MajorCrasher> @angel42199 I won't say it's impossible for it to happen, I just find it very unlikely given my experience with it and the genre in general
[0:57:56] <+Exicuren> Wandering Noble FTW
[0:57:58] <+Dakuu75> grandpa's ashes
[0:57:58] <CappuccinoGuil> @sevorai oh I know, I just didn't really care that much, but I suppose I'm drowning in the mats to upgrade them, so I might do that
[0:57:59] <LoneFonte> I'm still using the starting gift summon
[0:57:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> summon One Guy
[0:58:00] <@Solidus_113> once per fight
[0:58:01] <%RyTYoung> That one dude ROCKS
[0:58:05] <%hax_metatron> His description is HILARIOUS BTW
[0:58:05] <exnuart> only in specific areas too
[0:58:06] <thaprinnydood> theres tons of cool summons
[0:58:07] <+Chimeraelite> Ay don't knock the solo dudes
[0:58:09] <xxHungryxx> @archmortal Oleg
[0:58:18] <NoirEvans> the game is straight up telling you to not play alone lol
[0:58:18] <+thedream_c> ye of lil faith
[0:58:18] <%Archmortal> @xxHungryxx I said you can't!
[0:58:20] <CappuccinoGuil> I found a dude that costs 100 FP LMAO
[0:58:23] <+Dakuu75> are some ashes just, drops from random enemies?
[0:58:27] <skagtheprinceofhell> Level your MIND!
[0:58:29] <+Grayhammatter> my miiiiiiind!
[0:58:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> They can only be used in certain environments as well. You'll see a purple sigil on the left side of the screen when you are able to summon
[0:58:37] <+mechslayer71> do they stay for longer?
[0:58:38] <+thedream_c> Mmmmm
[0:58:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[0:58:40] <deviljhojho_> on god?
[0:58:42] <skagtheprinceofhell> Mind = 0
[0:58:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dakuu75 Bosses yes
[0:58:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @Dakuu75 not as far as I know, they are specific, you find them in the world
[0:58:47] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @MajorCrasher yeah a lot of gachas and money making mmos tend to fall by the wayside when it comes to story and characters, so people just kinda lose attachment when they die, but what about for the ones that are actually strong in the character/story department
[0:58:51] <+GallowsDrop> I can't wait til (or if) Woolie finds Oleg
[0:58:52] <+Akizea> @mechslayer71 summons all last untill they die
[0:58:53] <AmazingBlanket> @Dakuu75 from what i've found only from notable enemies or in notable areas
[0:58:53] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL lazy noble
[0:58:53] <+thedream_c> strong mind , strong stand
[0:59:04] <@Solidus_113> banished homie oleg
[0:59:05] <+Dakuu75> ah ok. thanks chat.
[0:59:05] <%akajaybay> they'll stay till killed or you "finish" the objective of the spot like beat the boss or clear the whole ruins
[0:59:08] <%slipdog> You can heal them and buff them too!
[0:59:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @GallowsDrop gonna take a bit to summon Oleg, he has 74 FP
[0:59:12] <+donmagicjuann> art of war scaling is dope as well
[0:59:14] <%jinking79> stand powers V
[0:59:15] <%ChoculaUltra> Mimic Tear ashes completely trivializes the game
[0:59:16] <%Dcapit8ed> Lhutel and Oleg have insane survivability
[0:59:17] <+pectusumbra> You can just say Stand User
[0:59:17] <+mechslayer71> @akizea thnx
[0:59:27] <skagtheprinceofhell> Hello Santa
[0:59:27] <%Collieburr> Santa!
[0:59:28] <BlackermanZX> hi santa
[0:59:30] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Also, buffs can be applied to them just like regular players via miracles and such
[0:59:32] <+Grayhammatter> hi santa
[0:59:33] <%MajorCrasher> @angel42199 I guess we'll have to see once genshin gets a bit older
[0:59:33] <deviljhojho_> what race is that guy supposed to be?
[0:59:34] <+twohitgood> aye siwmae
[0:59:36] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> think they have similar restrictions to player summoning
[0:59:41] <deviljhojho_> Nightfolk or something?
[0:59:43] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Javaa01 Wait, you can fucking buff them?
[0:59:46] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @MajorCrasher yeah it should be pretty intresting
[0:59:53] <+0neReeler> one of these times he's going to say "ho"
[1:00:01] <%holydeviant1> cookbooks are always a good idea, even if you don't craft, options are good
[1:00:04] <+Javaa01> @skagtheprinceofhell Yeah, get something that buffs in an AOE and they'll get the buff
[1:00:09] <CappuccinoGuil> Cookbooks are great
[1:00:11] <+Dakuu75> I recomend the cookbooks and jars.
[1:00:26] <DSD24> Oh ye of 6 faith
[1:00:27] <+Javaa01> They can even take healing and health regeneration buffs
[1:00:29] <+Grayhammatter> cookbooks and cracked pots, and notes are pretty good
[1:00:34] <%hax_metatron> My advie is just play and buy whatever, levelups come from bosses
[1:01:09] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @hax_metatron yeah, my level ups come solely from bosses and from through clusters on tombs full of Gold Runes
[1:01:12] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> whats the threshold on fat rolls? 70?
[1:01:15] <emptyantics> Casca Griffith gf
[1:01:25] <+Dakuu75> get the "no skill", skill. lol yeah.
[1:01:29] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's really good for torches
[1:01:32] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> you can mess around so much in this game it feels like its easy to over level, Im worried about meeting a cool boss at too high a level and then making it ez and boring lol
[1:01:38] <+mechslayer71> 70 percent yeah
[1:01:47] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> @mechslayer71 thanks

[1:06:57] <%MajorCrasher> I'm guessing the magic build is dead now?

[1:07:14] <wandelmilch> Flask of absolute baffonery
[1:07:18] <%hax_metatron> I'm so sorry everyone, I spent 65+ hours in Elden Ring, and just learned you can "unequip" weapon arts. I only thought you can swap between them. I'm so sorry Woolie :(
[1:07:21] <+Javaa01> @mrtanaka111 He's 20 hours away
[1:07:24] <jvilly96> @Ebonyglow omg its not it sounds so much like her
[1:07:26] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @hax_metatron No worries
[1:07:32] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd3
[1:07:32] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yep
[1:07:35] <DSD24> AOE stomp
[1:07:36] <+theoldone001> Make sure to equip berries to heal Torrent, you'll need them
[1:07:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh wow, that was very little mana cost
[1:07:40] <orochiblood> so woolie is going STR/INT?
[1:07:41] <%Ebonyglow> @jvilly96 i did double take when i first heard it
[1:07:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> Knockback
[1:07:45] <%slipdog> one way to find out
[1:07:46] <mothdude> @hax_metatron I learned something today.
[1:07:46] <+OrangeMDT> @velgaduere nah, no mistakes allowed
[1:07:47] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie likes BIG STOMP
[1:07:48] <BlackermanZX> that dead space chunky stamp
[1:07:49] <%holydeviant1> weapon arts tend to be cheaper than spells
[1:07:52] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Go try on an enemy I gues
[1:07:53] <+sevorai> INTO THE LAB
[1:07:53] <+Tuffty> @hax_metatron All good man, it's fun to know even at 65hrs we can still learn stuff.
[1:07:56] <skagtheprinceofhell> Better question DOES IT STAGGER BIG ENEMIES
[1:07:57] <toulon_somberjade> Also gives you some super armot
[1:07:58] <Tryhardblackguy> AOE, and it‚Äôs way faster than the one I have
[1:08:03] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @hax_metatron no mistakes allowed your on the list now buddy
[1:08:03] <%slipdog> On-the-Fly Labbing ahead
[1:08:04] <+Javaa01> Weapon arts have been made generally much cheaper compared to DS3
[1:08:06] <fragdar> yo, this armor is awesome.. where did they get that? its a drop?
[1:08:07] <CappuccinoGuil> It's not about damage... IT'S ABOUT HUNGER
[1:08:09] <velgaduere> @OrangeMDT damn, hate to see you go so soon then woolieEVIL
[1:08:11] <Shiibbae> Charge?
[1:08:19] <orochiblood> @fragdar kill these soldiers until it drops
[1:08:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> It's Super Armor/AoE dmage/stagger
[1:08:26] <mothdude> Shield killer
[1:08:28] <BlackermanZX> oh thats good
[1:08:29] <%slipdog> AOE stagger might be a really good oh shit button
[1:08:29] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @fragdar yeah a drop from the big halbared and shield knight in the camp
[1:08:31] <megaman_sentinel> it's a good opener
[1:08:32] <+OrangeMDT> @velgaduere LUL
[1:08:37] <Tryhardblackguy> That‚Äôs sick
[1:08:37] <+pectusumbra> An AoE stagger is not bad for getting out of trouble
[1:08:37] <+sewermonk> Visions of wind
[1:08:37] <+0neReeler> stomp the yard
[1:08:39] <skagtheprinceofhell> Can you upgrade the ashes of war?
[1:08:39] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @WoolieVersus Can you charge it? Some arts can be charged up
[1:08:44] <@Solidus_113> some ashes of war are chargable
[1:08:45] <%Indigo_Automaton> You can charge some weapon arts, I don't know if the stomp can though
[1:08:45] <+MooseIsGoose> If you stomp and hit R2 what happens.
[1:08:50] <+Dova573> I think it can stagger break too
[1:08:54] <enerkaizer> stab stab stab, that is my estoc life
[1:08:58] <+Jiggisnipe> wait
[1:09:02] <toulon_somberjade> Good for setting up charged attacks
[1:09:03] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[1:09:03] <%hax_metatron> Am I right? Ash of war damage scales with weapon scaling? Does anyone know?
[1:09:07] <+Javaa01> Yeah some arts can be charged, but not this one
[1:09:11] <%slipdog> can you combo into it?
[1:09:19] <%diegobandzz> Damn woolie got that wind sword shit
[1:09:20] <orochiblood> some arts have combos if you press more
[1:09:20] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @hax_metatron I think so
[1:09:22] <+Tuffty> SO GOOD
[1:09:30] <total_overkill> @hax_metatron scaling and weapon lvl
[1:09:31] <%diegobandzz> Those guys been fucking me up üòÖ
[1:09:37] <+Tuffty> I uppercutted a big knight last night, felt amazing
[1:09:37] <+0neReeler> launch and jump helmbreaker
[1:09:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> free Kreygasm
[1:09:48] <%khalcipher> woolieONEGUY  was woolieONEGUY
[1:09:49] <%hax_metatron> Yeah my bad
[1:09:52] <CappuccinoGuil> You can 100% just try out Ashes of War guilt-free
[1:09:52] <+mechslayer71> that was one of the biggest one guys in a while
[1:09:58] <orochiblood> im INT/DEX, with my Vergil cosplay
[1:09:59] <%hax_metatron> I just learned something today :(
[1:10:05] <Tryhardblackguy> What‚Äôs the difference between quality and standard?
[1:10:13] <+GilroyGoldBlood> That's a sexy sword
[1:10:19] <%khalcipher> @hax_metatron no worries
[1:10:20] <%DkLordG> Quality boosts strengh scaling
[1:10:22] <DSD24> @Tryhardblackguy Quality is scaling for strength and dex
[1:10:22] <+gitgouda> @Tryhardblackguy it changes the scaling
[1:10:25] <+GilroyGoldBlood> SQUARE UP
[1:10:27] <Dabrikishaw> I think quality scaling increases the amount of points you get from strength and Dex specifically
[1:10:28] <+Nekros4442> @tryhardblackguy quality is better scaling but less base dmg
[1:10:30] <+mechslayer71> @tryhardblackguy scaling and base damage
[1:10:32] <KnightAsteran> quality is scaling with both dex and strength evenly
[1:10:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @Tryhardblackguy standard is the basic scaling the weapon has. Quality evens out STR and DEX, I believe
[1:10:40] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @Tryhardblackguy standard is just the weapons regular scaling, quality changes it to dex and str scaling with less base damage ?
[1:10:41] <Someguy893> that greatsword carried me all the way to level 60
[1:10:42] <Dabrikishaw> What has standard scaling assist a general increase in base damage
[1:10:46] <+Grayhammatter> DS3 move
[1:10:54] <@Solidus_113> stance
[1:11:01] <resloxxx> THATS THE STANCE
[1:11:02] <%Reveresao> thats good shit there
[1:11:02] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's really good for pvp
[1:11:04] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Yeah DS3 stance hell yeayh
[1:11:07] <Tryhardblackguy> I‚Äôm kinda new to the souls build stuff. I just play if you know what I mean. What do you all mean by scaling?
[1:11:08] <OblivionSword1> classic longsword stance from DS3
[1:11:08] <wandelmilch> just stance
[1:11:19] <+mechslayer71> katanas have that too
[1:11:22] <Exeerdna> THIS THE STANCE
[1:11:27] <velgaduere> this is The Stance‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
[1:11:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and it doesn't use much fp which is nice
[1:11:31] <orochiblood> Katanas got the vergil sheathe animation
[1:11:36] <mrtanaka111> is woolie labing again?
[1:11:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Tryhardblackguy weapon damage scales based on certain stats, different weapons scale off different stats
[1:11:40] <Psyramics> was that Square Off? I had no idea what that did so never used it
[1:11:41] <DSD24> @Tryhardblackguy If you have a high stat lets say Strength and the weapon has a A in scaling then that means you get more damage off your stat
[1:11:42] <%diegobandzz> Anyone know how far woolie got?
[1:11:44] <orochiblood> well, more like Jetstream Sam really
[1:11:46] <+GilroyGoldBlood> LAUNCH
[1:11:49] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @Tryhardblackguy scaling means the weapon gets bonus stats according to what stats you level up. So a weapon with S in strength scaling will get a lot of points if you level up strength all the way
[1:11:52] <+mechslayer71> that ain't a greatsword chief. trust me suprCHAD
[1:11:59] <+Grayhammatter> that was also in DS3 LUL
[1:12:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's just a goodsword
[1:12:06] <Monkeyweed21> guard break stance
[1:12:10] <PanicSwytch> I saw that the weapon dex scale went from D to B,  what does that scaling do?
[1:12:14] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> the letter grade on the scaling affects how much bonus points you get. S is the best E is the worse
[1:12:18] <Tryhardblackguy> @angel42199 ah, thanks friend
[1:12:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> I love that even the returning skills and weapon arts have been polished up and feel even better than they did back then
[1:12:30] <toulon_somberjade> Best part of ER's Affinties is that they're no longer tied to refinement +'s
[1:12:30] <orochiblood> The framerate tanker
[1:12:36] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:12:40] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Double jump doesn't break fall FYI
[1:12:40] <+froduck42> both
[1:12:41] <iacus_> horse damage too
[1:12:41] <skagtheprinceofhell> Both damage
[1:12:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> both
[1:12:43] <+Jiggisnipe> now you know Woolie
[1:12:43] <%khalcipher> both
[1:12:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:12:44] <Iriyia> Double jump does not stop fall momentum
[1:12:45] <%notsoy> double jumping does not reduce fall damage
[1:12:46] <+Grayhammatter> both damage
[1:12:47] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> @Tryhardblackguy no problem man
[1:12:48] <+Jiggisnipe> there is fall damage
[1:12:48] <BlackermanZX> both actually
[1:12:49] <+mechslayer71> fall damage is worse on horseback
[1:12:49] <Shwepie> Horse and You damage.
[1:12:49] <velgaduere> both
[1:12:50] <styptysat> Double jump doesn't reset fall damage
[1:12:54] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Other way around
[1:12:55] <megaman_sentinel> yeah that was just bad timing on a double jump
[1:12:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Has anyone found a weapon or skill that does the Black knight Great Sword/ Axe that sparks on the ground launcher?
[1:12:56] <toulon_somberjade> As in changing affinity will no longer reset your +'s
[1:12:59] <+Grayhammatter> double jump does not reset your falling
[1:13:00] <+GilroyGoldBlood> exit point is below church
[1:13:01] <Monkeyweed21> @PanicSwytch scaling affects how much bonus damage you get from that particular stat as you level it up
[1:13:01] <+sevorai> Fall damage is based off fall time if I remember right @WoolieVersus
[1:13:02] <%hax_metatron> No
[1:13:03] <skagtheprinceofhell> Horse and you have seperate health bars that you can heal together with an item upgrade or berry you can craft for him
[1:13:08] <iacus_> you can feed raisins to the horse to refill their HP
[1:13:15] <%hax_metatron> South: First step
[1:13:16] <+Javaa01> Double jumping won't mitigate falls
[1:13:20] <+GilroyGoldBlood> South of church
[1:13:27] <%hax_metatron> South of Church: First step
[1:13:28] <+GilroyGoldBlood> it's called First Step
[1:13:30] <Shiibbae> You can‚Äôt break your fall, jump is OOONLY for movement
[1:13:35] <%Collieburr> somtimes the best way forward is to go backwards
[1:13:37] <+froduck42> Dragon nards
[1:13:40] <iacus_> twitch compression hates all this grass
[1:13:44] <%Indigo_Automaton> Are you looking for the spawn? It's south of the Church of Elleh
[1:13:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> they're gross
[1:13:54] <+mechslayer71> oh you got no idea reggie
[1:13:56] <+RegularCore> what is this supposed to be?
[1:14:04] <iacus_> dragon testicles
[1:14:11] <+GilroyGoldBlood> The spawn is south of the Church of Elleh
[1:14:12] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh, you CAN get these things in a critical stab animation
[1:14:12] <+froduck42> somrthing like a sea slug i guess
[1:14:16] <+vaporousTippler> Got up and fell back down like it's Injustice.
[1:14:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dragonfly got hands

[1:18:53] <+GilroyGoldBlood> You just put em in your item bar in your inventory
[1:18:55] <@Solidus_113> just items
[1:18:56] <%Indigo_Automaton> You just put them in your item bar or the quick menu
[1:18:57] <%hax_metatron> Equippable items
[1:18:58] <%Archmortal> equip them like any other useable item
[1:18:59] <+Grayhammatter> just put em in your equipment bar, they're items
[1:18:59] <%Deasmeister> items
[1:19:00] <SarcFa> useable item
[1:19:00] <+Dakuu75> summons are, use item.
[1:19:02] <%diegobandzz> Equip it to items
[1:19:04] <@Solidus_113> you can use the quick pouch too
[1:19:05] <%OdeToKale> like any item
[1:19:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> I stick em in my pouch
[1:19:09] <%Reveresao> left
[1:19:09] <+RushUnplugged> just put the item on the pouch or item slots
[1:19:11] <thefranchise00> the bell isn't equipable you just put the spell on your item slot
[1:19:12] <superchunk121> There an item like te flask or bombs
[1:19:14] <+GilroyGoldBlood> The quick pouch is so useful
[1:19:21] <%pi_in_the_sci> The summons are just a usable item, I generally put them in the other pouch slots with Torrent
[1:19:28] <toulon_somberjade> You can only summon if you see a tombstone icon on the left side of the screen
[1:19:29] <%Reveresao> keft

[1:20:20] <+0neReeler> why you walking into my hitbox
[1:20:22] <thefranchise00> here we goooooo
[1:20:24] <Monkeyweed21> Horse has 0 poise
[1:20:35] <Exeerdna> gotta respect the fire hitbox
[1:20:37] <+Fetrigon> antihorse move
[1:20:48] <toulon_somberjade> horse gets nuked by guy who's lower on the pole then the most basic hollows
[1:20:50] <user_naim> Okay so torch guys are fucking yari ashigaru of elden ring
[1:20:52] <thefranchise00> yeee wolf time
[1:20:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> pouch is a good spot for em, makes it harder to accidentally use it
[1:20:57] <%hax_metatron> Wolves wolves
[1:21:00] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Only in certain areas
[1:21:03] <%diegobandzz> Where my jellyfish gang at???
[1:21:04] <nintega010> alright time to choose a direction woolie go
[1:21:06] <%plsunbanmyacc> summons have different utilities more than just do more dmg i think
[1:21:06] <agustorm123> Is woolie afraid of stormwind casttle?
[1:21:09] <%DkLordG> I'm rocking 6+ wolves atm
[1:21:10] <%slipdog> yeah choose the right tool for the job
[1:21:15] <iacus_> yes but you can only summon one per encounter
[1:21:17] <%radiorosewater> hey guys
[1:21:19] <%hax_metatron> One per encounter
[1:21:19] <user_naim> @agustorm123 probably just explorin‚Äô
[1:21:19] <+nolawg> u can only summon in fights
[1:21:19] <+Arnoldoaad1> 2 at a time
[1:21:21] <%radiorosewater> !uptime
[1:21:21] <@Moobot> @radiorosewater WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 36 minutes
[1:21:24] <Monkeyweed21> I found a fukin hunting hawk
[1:21:27] <+Arnoldoaad1> 1 at a time
[1:21:29] <toulon_somberjade> One summon Per Encounter
[1:21:36] <+duskrush> less about strength, more about behavior. Wolves are squishy and few but they're fast and aggressive. There are more noblemen but they're slow, weak, and scare easily
[1:21:41] <%RyTYoung> @monkeyweed21 no fucking way
[1:21:43] <%Indigo_Automaton> @Monkeyweed21 The stormhawk? He's fantastic
[1:22:04] <+pupil31> This is gonna be super long
[1:22:07] <%radiorosewater> this is gonna be a long one
[1:22:15] <Monkeyweed21> @RyTYoung he's at the mind gobliniest place in the game i've found
[1:22:15] <+duskrush> Close your heart to being thorough. There is no hope
[1:22:18] <user_naim> This is going to be like 200 episodes
[1:22:21] <+froduck42> you can skip the gates
[1:22:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's some big shit everywhere
[1:22:29] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yep
[1:22:33] <PanicSwytch> Im still i. the opening area for the past 3 days
[1:22:36] <%RyTYoung> @monkeyweed21 oh no guess I‚Äôll never find him NotLikeThis
[1:22:37] <%slipdog> take your sweet time man because as long as i stay ahead of you in the game i can watch :D
[1:22:44] <+Akizea> not on jumping off, just on regular dismount
[1:22:50] <%radiorosewater> can the horse shit
[1:22:54] <+duskrush> There's straight up no hope in getting everything
[1:22:56] <agustorm123> Hope he gets to stormwind today tho
[1:22:56] <+duskrush> Not for a while
[1:22:59] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus If the horse poise gets broken tho, that's instant death, enemies get a free riposte on you
[1:23:02] <toulon_somberjade> just don't crouch
[1:23:02] <%hax_metatron> Read the swords
[1:23:03] <Monkeyweed21> @RyTYoung no its easy to find but the primary mechanic almost gave me a panic attack out of FOMO

[1:28:58] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> lotta horse naps today
[1:28:59] <%akajaybay> good place to summon
[1:29:02] <toulon_somberjade> L1 while on horseback will swing your weapon to your left
[1:29:04] <%Lion_kun> Summoning only costs a sip if the horse dies
[1:29:04] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh sick you got more sips back
[1:29:04] <%hax_metatron> Thank GOd for Reggie
[1:29:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Clearing a group of enemies in the open areas will do that, not in dungeons, though
[1:29:06] <%akajaybay> let them do some lifting
[1:29:15] <%khalcipher> summoning cost a sip if torrent is dead
[1:29:16] <+RegularCore> The horse only costs a sip if it dies
[1:29:21] <%Indigo_Automaton> It happens to me all the time
[1:29:24] <+gitgouda> even if its just the dude and his horse on their own it counts as a group.
[1:29:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> also when you see those white sparks on enemies upon death that means they dropped shit
[1:29:27] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie be gripping the stick Kappa
[1:29:38] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> iron grip woolz at it again
[1:29:38] <%hax_metatron> Summon wolves
[1:29:39] <+Akizea> if you see white wisps when you kill something, that means it dropped an item
[1:29:41] <agustorm123> L3?
[1:29:41] <%radiorosewater> that LA noire LP was legendary
[1:29:42] <toulon_somberjade> You can summon here

[1:29:51] <MaybeFalco> @RyTYoung even with them not even approaching it, limgrave is so chunky and there's like 80 different things they could have done
[1:30:06] <+Fetrigon> what is that bitch yelp? OMEGALUL
[1:30:06] <%hiswill98> Horse only costs a flask if it dies, if you get knocked off horse but it doesn‚Äôt die it‚Äôs still free to summon
[1:30:09] <agustorm123> That parry didn‚Äôt work
[1:30:12] <%Reveresao> summon?
[1:30:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> they've been studying the blade
[1:30:22] <%Indigo_Automaton> Ice magic?
[1:30:23] <+Jaromero435> Magic :)
[1:30:27] <+RegularCore> magic
[1:30:28] <+Dakuu75> literally MAGIC
[1:30:28] <%akajaybay> call the wolf pack
[1:30:29] <agustorm123> He tried to fusrodah
[1:30:49] <%Indigo_Automaton> He's got a mini fridge on his horse saddle
[1:30:55] <user_naim> stick them in a cellar?
[1:31:00] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> arctic expedition for ice
[1:31:07] <NoirEvans> did you do the guy on the Evergaeol
[1:31:13] <CappuccinoGuil> Crafting is godlike in this
[1:31:27] <%Ashenik1> how is he doin?
[1:31:27] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Using your regular estus also heals the horse, so you don't need to worry about the raisins much
[1:31:38] <%slipdog> raisin is for when the horse gets hit but you dont
[1:31:40] <+Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus whenever you pick anything up. it shows the category icon, of what type of item it is.
[1:31:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> unless it's dead
[1:31:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO SIPS?
[1:31:42] <user_naim> @javaa01 oh it does?
[1:31:43] <agustorm123> Torren tanked for me sometimes
[1:31:44] <%hax_metatron> You don't use FP to get horse
[1:31:45] <+Akizea> he never takes a sip to summon unless he's deaf
[1:31:48] <+0neReeler> sippy sip
[1:31:50] <SarcFa> It only costs a sip if torrent died
[1:31:50] <+Javaa01> @user_naim Yes
[1:31:52] <+Jaromero435> Sipless FeelsBadMan
[1:31:52] <@Solidus_113> if torrent dies it'll take a health sip to respawn him
[1:31:58] <%JetpackMcQuack> c'est la vie
[1:31:59] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> the man wants his sips!
[1:31:59] <+duskrush> Damn, no sips, no maidens, ain't got shit
[1:32:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh boy that grass sure loaded
[1:32:01] <BepBepAmShep> Torrent has way more health than you think he does.  I don't think I've had him die without me dieing as well
[1:32:13] <Louie_Salmon> I believe Torrent also passively regens health
[1:32:17] <Psyramics> Horse does not cost sips to summon, it costs sips to rez if it dies
[1:32:20] <%radiorosewater> *hop*
[1:32:26] <%radiorosewater> ‚òª
[1:32:29] <+0neReeler> bloodborne, dying just go in
[1:32:34] <klooswep> Wait, Woolie refuses to go in?
[1:32:40] <Iriyia> Being knocked off Torrent does not mean Torrent died
[1:32:46] <user_naim> ‚ÄùUnfortunately, thou art sipless‚Äù
[1:32:54] <ToxInjection> maiden give me sips BibleThump
[1:33:10] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> sips exposed on stream

[1:37:03] <+RegularCore> map markers are your friends

[1:38:37] <+GilroyGoldBlood> dude said MOUNT UP

[1:39:11] <%bumpynavel> bumpynavel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! When I first started the game, I was skeptical on how huge is thinking people were exaggerating.  They wernt.  Other than Outer Wilds, I've never had this much fun exploring and discovering.
[1:39:12] <emptyantics> *gime*
[1:39:12] <Ner234> Can you imagine you're just chilling in your camp and some asshole mage just starts shooting you from his weird horse?
[1:39:15] <%xerotwo> D:
[1:39:15] <velgaduere> sounds like that "nyyyyyom" meme
[1:39:15] <user_naim> Aaaaeeeehh
[1:39:17] <%MrP33Ps> D:
[1:39:24] <+GilroyGoldBlood> That was sips coming back, just not all of them

[1:39:30] <%Deasmeister> yes it was
[1:39:31] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's like the scream you make in on a rollercoaster
[1:39:34] <brunoberserk> ''fuck you .... AND your horse too ''
[1:39:42] <klooswep> Woolie, slayer of horses, butcher of ponies, bane to all that is equestrian

[1:40:34] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I'm 45 hours in and completing forgot about counter attacking lmfao
[1:40:37] <%holydeviant1> What's funny is how rare enemies actually capitalize on a blown-open guard.
[1:40:50] <majindusto> IT'S  A COOKBOOK
[1:40:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:40:51] <iacus_> summon your own wolves
[1:41:03] <%holydeviant1> THe number of times Ive had a guy finish his combo, bust me open, and then... stand there...
[1:41:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> welp, i found summoned swords
[1:41:15] <user_naim> border anxienty
[1:41:21] <+GilroyGoldBlood> The amount restored depends on the size of group of difficulty of enemy
[1:41:25] <iacus_> next time
[1:41:25] <+pectusumbra> I believe the number and type of sips is based on the camp
[1:41:40] <+Nekros4442> @holydeviant1 i mean...if he did his full combo hes probably outa stamina too
[1:41:52] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @WoolieVersus try placing an actual marker on the map instead of a beacon. They are different things.
[1:41:59] <agustorm123> Use torren to take those skulls is faster

[1:47:05] <@Menitta> How does night happen?
[1:47:06] <+slimefancypants> Im too scared to explore at night and havent seen this dude
[1:47:07] <iacus_> TIP: holding down for 2 seconds resets your item to the first slot
[1:47:08] <%Archmortal> so I'm pretty sure the jump does not have invincibility, the game is just good about hitboxes and elevation
[1:47:09] <agustorm123> Use summons Woolie
[1:47:09] <BepBepAmShep> I've put the FP flask on the pocket slots just to avoid that.
[1:47:09] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe Torrent took the hit?
[1:47:13] <@Menitta> it's been day all of my game so far
[1:47:15] <+Arnoldoaad1> @Javaa01 ok, going back to lindell

[1:49:15] <%slipdog> hits different when you've been to all those places
[1:49:18] <CatsDrunkonCopper> tree!
[1:49:25] <+pectusumbra> The idea of undead coming back the next night or dawn is a thing as well. works well

[2:09:13] <+Jiggisnipe> what's the worst that could happen?
[2:09:18] <AzureSynesthesia> double jumping doesnt negate fall damage
[2:09:19] <koolkid1208> @woolieversus you got to go to the swamp to get down there
[2:09:22] <+dandywaffles> Bounce pad is safe landing with horse

[2:09:25] <$Slimshazbot> Double jump doesn't protect from fall damage chat
[2:09:28] <tubit> i learned about the double jump so late and it's so op
[2:09:29] <iacus_> or you can platform
[2:09:29] <nip_nips> double jumping makes you more likely to die, fall damage is based on time falling

[2:13:59] <%radiorosewater> just... hit them...
[2:13:59] <Blank9> Dead people in souls games are incredibly talk, based on skeletons
[2:14:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:14:00] <%pi_in_the_sci> Nope
[2:14:01] <@Solidus_113> not quite
[2:14:02] <+sevorai> let the man figure it out please chat

[2:14:16] <%GrandpaJaji> guys, hes playing the game, let him FIGURE it out
[2:14:17] <+Grayhammatter> :)
[2:14:17] <+RemedyofRevenge> Chat dont backseat
[2:14:18] <+Aeoneth> :)
[2:14:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> Landing on those Spirit Springs also negates fall damage
[2:14:21] <yukichocomilk> @Javaa01 stop
[2:14:24] <Iza_kku> no sack beaters
[2:14:26] <%notsoy> it'll be more funny when he doesn't figure it out for two sessions, stop helping him
[2:14:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> chat if you ever feel like backseating, just post a happy little smiley :)
[2:14:40] <%radiorosewater> :(
[2:14:42] <grouchomarxy> I get into the habit of backseating, but forget that learning this stuff is half the fun of playing
[2:14:43] <emptyantics> :(
[2:14:45] <+dandywaffles> This is your chance to experiment with the skeletons
[2:14:46] <+Jiggisnipe> @ReallyBigRocks saying nothing also works
[2:14:50] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> bottle it all up
[2:14:56] <NYCrownlessKing> jumping off a horse includes hitting the crouch button, yes.
[2:14:57] <Iza_kku> if you ever feel like backseating, simply don't type the thing
[2:15:01] <+SneakyBeaver102> what you have to do is sacrifice chat to unlock the mystery
[2:15:02] <+solzan2000> ^
[2:15:02] <xxHungryxx> üíÄ
[2:15:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Jiggisnipe very true :)
[2:15:08] <agustorm123> :) smile
[2:15:09] <HelghastTroop> make the dodge roll L3 Kappa
[2:15:11] <%notsoy> woolie will gladly sacrifice chat lmao
[2:15:13] <emptyantics> @iza_kku Amen
[2:15:17] <%notsoy> nothing lost, and i can't blame him for thinking that way
[2:15:24] <+Javaa01> @yukichocomilk I only confirmed it cause Reggie did make the correct call on intuition
[2:15:25] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Change it to triangle
[2:15:32] <@Menitta> relax
[2:15:36] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> coming from mon hun, i kept trying to hold r1 to sprint in this
[2:15:43] <Louie_Salmon> Just gotta stop strangling the controller
[2:15:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> There‚Äôs an item you can map to triangle
[2:15:47] <agustorm123> Crouch is good
[2:15:49] <%Lion_kun> You have to switch something
[2:15:59] <+HefestoForges> because of jump I had to use left ctrl while playing on keyboard
[2:16:02] <HelghastTroop> woolie cant handle the new and confusing controls
[2:16:05] <emptyantics> Crouch with L1 and attack with circle
[2:16:09] <+AnIrishPapaya> NotLikeThis
[2:16:09] <NeonBleu> Does the mount shortcut also dismount?
[2:16:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> I map the whistle to triangle+right
[2:16:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:16:21] <thaprinnydood> @„Çª„Éì„Éº i change all my dark souls controls to MH when playing them XD
[2:16:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> gamepad struggles
[2:16:22] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> tbf, triangle to interact is rough
[2:16:27] <%pi_in_the_sci> That is a terrible choice, since it's also the two hand and pouch button
[2:16:28] <+RegularCore> up arrow?
[2:16:29] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:16:30] <+solzan2000> I just learned the new control scheme
[2:16:31] <agustorm123> The controls are kinda strange tho
[2:16:36] <HelghastTroop> attack should be cross button
[2:16:36] <+Dakuu75> best thing is to get use to the default, unfortunately
[2:16:36] <lockhead45> Hows Snail Ring been going today?
[2:16:37] <+solzan2000> sucked it up
[2:16:37] <+noticemepaisen> I have jumped at so many npc's LUL
[2:16:38] <%Lion_kun> Just keep it as is and learn Woolie
[2:16:40] <@Solidus_113> just deathgrip less Kappa
[2:16:40] <BreakfastSampler> the controls are fine, people are just really bad at adjusting
[2:16:44] <agustorm123> Triangule for taking items is strange
[2:16:46] <KaiserMario> LUL
[2:16:46] <koolkid1208> @woolieversus hey I wouldn‚Äôt swap triangle as I heard it Biggs out certain actions
[2:16:51] <+softdeadline> woolie inventing new messed up control scheme before our eyes
[2:16:53] <Psyramics> woolie got a lead thumb
[2:16:53] <+Aeoneth> Woolie just be gentle with the controller lol
[2:16:54] <Louie_Salmon> That's a weird habit
[2:16:55] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> cross or ecks button, duke it out chat!
[2:16:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> deathgrip johns Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:16:56] <KaiserMario> L3 to two hand
[2:16:57] <+Babooboomin> that's kinda fucky LUL
[2:17:02] <stormhawk9891> Just how hard are you gripping that controller?
[2:17:03] <+AnIrishPapaya> man swapping triangle removes so much funcyionality
[2:17:04] <+Jiggisnipe> chat the issue is he's getting off the horse by mistake
[2:17:04] <agustorm123> Is cross
[2:17:05] <HelghastTroop> oh woolie one of those fuckers that squeeze the controller
[2:17:05] <%JetpackMcQuack> Can‚Äôt have that here
[2:17:07] <+slimefancypants> Its the answer you get lol
[2:17:08] <AzureSynesthesia> this is going to make other control intereactions weird
[2:17:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> just don't Kappa
[2:17:17] <Louie_Salmon> Damn how hard do you hold a controller?
[2:17:17] <SmortyPuffin> i can hear the plastic creaking
[2:17:18] <Psyramics> Woolie's training for the Thumb War has come to bite him in the ass
[2:17:20] <%Lion_kun> Woolie you play fighting games, where is your delicacy
[2:17:26] <+HefestoForges> yeah the menu mapping, at least on pc, is fixed now
[2:17:26] <+pupil31> YOLO
[2:17:26] <+Javaa01> @koolkid1208 Yeah unfortunately right now there's a bug where swapping jump and interact makes it skip the first line of every dialogue
[2:17:35] <+OrangeMDT> Yo Reggie spittin
[2:17:35] <%Reveresao> magic?
[2:17:36] <+PatchTheSquid> Inb4 "WoolieVS compilation; saved by accidental horse frames"
[2:17:37] <+THEmetallicfloyd> A power pressure on those sticks
[2:17:40] <yukichocomilk> I noticed today that they fixed bloodstains (on pc at least)
[2:17:41] <Nmiser> F I R E
[2:17:42] <%notsoy> lmao
[2:17:47] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Classic souls slimes
[2:17:48] <agustorm123> Is a big jumpad
[2:17:49] <HelghastTroop> yup slimes are bullshit
[2:17:53] <VJdarkworld> @javaa01 oh shit thats why thats been happening monkaS
[2:17:53] <+Jaromero435> Jellyfish :D
[2:17:54] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> @javaa01 oof
[2:17:54] <VincentGraves> I guess he forgot slimes are weak to fire
[2:17:54] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:17:55] <HelghastTroop> always have been
[2:17:55] <TigerClaws12> uh oh

[2:18:04] <tubit> danger zooone
[2:18:12] <HelghastTroop> KING COMBO
[2:18:15] <yukichocomilk> such an odd problem LUL i've never accidentally L3
[2:18:17] <%Lion_kun> Just don't use the horse except for travel lol
[2:18:24] <+TheEvilOmega> One time I got stuck in a corner and got combo'd to death by a dog and rat. Those fuckers are no joke.
[2:18:30] <koolkid1208> @javaa01 right which sucks since I know going from X to triangle is really confusing for a lot of people sadly
[2:18:32] <+Fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:18:32] <+noticemepaisen> Oh, I think he did it by accident
[2:18:33] <+OniOniOniiii> i have the same issue, but more with crouching when i dont want to
[2:18:36] <+HefestoForges> oh boy
[2:18:40] <%oneimportantthing> LUL LUL
[2:18:42] <iacus_> yeah run past
[2:18:44] <johnjohnmajima> hit the light after they die
[2:18:45] <lockhead45> The Backdown
[2:18:48] <user_naim> @theevilomega dogs and rats are the hardest enemies in souls games
[2:18:48] <Iza_kku> can confirm rats have combo'd me to death
[2:18:50] <KaiserMario> great
[2:18:52] <agustorm123> :)
[2:18:54] <%imthewisejanitor> It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only person who repeatedly L3 and R3s by accident in games. It happens.
[2:18:54] <+HefestoForges> time for the hole
[2:18:57] <%notsoy> i mean, being outnumbered 5 to 1 is a good reason to backdown in souls games
[2:18:59] <%oneimportantthing> What a hero
[2:19:03] <HelghastTroop> welcome to scrub souls
[2:19:05] <%radiorosewater> :(
[2:19:08] <dan_g_v> Think Zelda, Woolie
[2:19:09] <%DkLordG> try magic
[2:19:09] <+OctaivianRex> Sick cape. That plume spear fucker in the first village dropped that huh?
[2:19:09] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> skeles keeping the tradition alive since Des
[2:19:10] <iacus_> these are the typical souls slugs. use fire
[2:19:11] <+TheEvilOmega> If there are multiple dogs/ rats you just get fucked or get lucky.
[2:19:12] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Souls slimes just resist everything
[2:19:14] <+pectusumbra> try fire?
[2:19:17] <%Ashenik1> oh boy this place...
[2:19:21] <%slipdog> oh geez
[2:19:23] <+pectusumbra> they feel like the DS1 slimes
[2:19:25] <HelghastTroop> so chat, whats the time it takes for woolie to figure it out ?
[2:19:29] <+AnIrishPapaya> they existed in DS3. they are just annoyingly tough
[2:19:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @pectusumbra they feel like DeS slimes
[2:19:36] <agustorm123> Strong for no reason
[2:19:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> point to the back of that thing please
[2:19:39] <+solzan2000> lol
[2:19:43] <%pi_in_the_sci> They follow the same rule oozes always do in these games
[2:19:46] <%townzzzzz> it's just the slimes from the other souls LUL
[2:19:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> where is it?
[2:19:49] <iacus_> these aren't worth killing btw
[2:19:53] <dan_g_v> you need to flip these things over to get to the "back"
[2:19:54] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> sewer slimes in ds1 too
[2:19:54] <%akajaybay> theyre pretty slow to threaten
[2:19:54] <tubit> the delay effect on the spells look pretty cool
[2:20:01] <+HefestoForges> 16 whole souls
[2:20:01] <+Catpurnicus> ds1 Depths slime boys
[2:20:05] <HelghastTroop> 16 runes
[2:20:07] <HelghastTroop> amazing
[2:20:07] <+OctaivianRex> @GilroyGoldBlood Well, except fire.
[2:20:08] <xxHungryxx> Dungeon Time
[2:20:08] <%akajaybay> just a enviornment hazard
[2:20:11] <dan_g_v> just burn them with your cheap torch
[2:20:18] <agustorm123> Like Woolie those are not bosses they are not worth it LUL
[2:20:19] <HelghastTroop> so did woolie find that cave
[2:20:22] <%townzzzzz> finally some meat
[2:20:23] <+HefestoForges> time for pain
[2:20:24] <HelghastTroop> with important guy?
[2:20:28] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Don't think you are
[2:20:28] <%Lion_kun> You are not.
[2:20:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nah, it's just slimes
[2:20:31] <%hax_metatron> NO
[2:20:32] <Iza_kku> only one way to find out
[2:20:32] <yukichocomilk> @HelghastTroop not yet
[2:20:35] <%Cherokia666> You're probably fine. Just look
[2:20:35] <%Reveresao> sit
[2:20:35] <+AnIrishPapaya> not under leveled. just classic slimes my dude
[2:20:36] <%hax_metatron> Those slimes are just tanky
[2:20:36] <HelghastTroop> oh
[2:20:37] <%radiorosewater> you are not
[2:20:39] <+tempestzephyr> you're fine
[2:20:40] <+Sir_Louis> slimes good against swords
[2:20:40] <iacus_> I forgot what was in here
[2:20:41] <HelghastTroop> im excited now
[2:20:41] <KaiserMario> sit
[2:20:41] <%Jakeofalco> your not
[2:20:42] <%plsunbanmyacc> time for some offscreen grinding hmm
[2:20:43] <%slipdog> You are DEF not underleveled for  just about anything in Limgrave
[2:20:43] <TheyCallMeVawn> Youre fine
[2:20:44] <KaiserMario> LUL
[2:20:44] <mrtanaka111> youre not underlveveld,just playing bad
[2:20:45] <agustorm123> Nah
[2:20:49] <HelghastTroop> so fuckin hyped for that cave
[2:20:49] <user_naim> slimes have always been tough in these games
[2:20:51] <+Javaa01> Slimes as is souls tradition are tanky as hell
[2:20:52] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[2:20:54] <+dandywaffles> Slimes just don‚Äôt take much phys damage
[2:20:56] <Timarkot> All that blood
[2:21:03] <%pi_in_the_sci> Yeah, slimes are strong against everything but pierce and fire
[2:21:05] <%slipdog> Damage types are a bigger deal than they've been before i think
[2:21:07] <mrtanaka111> woolie waaay too scared of normal things
[2:21:08] <KaiserMario> You'll figure it out
[2:21:12] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @WoolieVersus everything in Limgrave is around your level. Those are just classic souls slimes being super resistant to most things
[2:21:16] <HelghastTroop> cant remeber if this catacomb was skeletons or imps
[2:21:26] <SubjectX07x> It's skeletons, you have to double tap them once down. @woolieversus
[2:21:27] <tubit> tough in the sense of high phys resist, otherwise, they're pretty weak
[2:21:31] <%radiorosewater> this is going to be a long LP. cant wait for the supercut
[2:21:33] <agustorm123> Remember the summons tho
[2:21:34] <+OctaivianRex> @pi_in_the_sci Didn't know they were weak to piece. I thought it was just fire.
[2:21:41] <resloxxx> @SubjectX07x dont backseat let him figure it out

[2:22:02] <xxHungryxx> @subjectx07x Don't be a Dung Eater
[2:22:05] <iacus_> that weapon swings too slow for these guys
[2:22:10] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> this is some nice lighting
[2:22:20] <Iza_kku> this game is great
[2:22:21] <%radiorosewater> @radiorosewater pain
[2:22:22] <tubit> the lighting looks great
[2:22:27] <user_naim> ‚ÄùThe Loathsome Backseater!‚Äù
[2:22:28] <+HefestoForges> he was just taking a break
[2:22:29] <%oneimportantthing> I love all these tiny mines, some of them are really unique
[2:22:29] <HelghastTroop> welcome to asset flips the game LuL
[2:22:37] <KaiserMario> Man, clicking to pick up stuff is a trip LUL
[2:22:48] <OneSassyMoogle> "It's never the one you see that gets you." kupo
[2:22:53] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> hard to top the asset flipped dungeons in dragonage 2
[2:23:01] <HelghastTroop> good to see woolie embracing the bullshit jump attacks
[2:23:11] <HelghastTroop> @„Çª„Éì„Éº your not wrong actually
[2:23:27] <+HefestoForges> :)
[2:23:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[2:23:29] <%slipdog> Better than chalice dungeons but very similar
[2:23:33] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> i remember getting real confused at filled in doors from reused assers
[2:23:40] <%hax_metatron> Except NOT randomized
[2:23:43] <%oneimportantthing> I've seen some people say this is in fact more similar to DS2 than DS3. Thoughts?
[2:23:43] <%hax_metatron> They're all hand crafted
[2:23:45] <mrtanaka111> also kknow as,just dungeons
[2:23:45] <+OctaivianRex> That's is basically exactly what they are. But the reward they have at the end is actually good sometimes.
[2:23:46] <%slipdog> These are all handcrafted at least
[2:23:56] <+pectusumbra> big tile
[2:23:58] <+theoldone001> One criticism to the game was that these little dungeons got repetitive, but I've gone through a lot of them and have yet to get bored of them.
[2:24:01] <%Cherokia666> The big obvious button might be a trap
[2:24:03] <xxHungryxx> Those lil' goons
[2:24:04] <wandelmilch> Kinda prefered the aesthetic of the chalice dungeons to these lil caves ngl
[2:24:09] <iacus_> you avoided it
[2:24:12] <+pectusumbra> you walked around
[2:24:12] <agustorm123> These dungeons are just chalice repurpose
[2:24:14] <tubit> he went around it
[2:24:15] <%andre11dr> Luckily, they get more interesting later on
[2:24:17] <iacus_> i thiught it was on purpose lol
[2:24:25] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> i felt nothing but misery in chalice dungeons
[2:24:27] <HelghastTroop> @theoldone001 catacombs are dull but aves can have some real neat layouts

[2:25:42] <+solzan2000> I got their wep, pretty decent
[2:25:42] <%radiorosewater> seeth
[2:25:44] <iacus_> these imps are so freaking annoying
[2:25:45] <HelghastTroop> we in madden town now
[2:25:51] <user_naim> right, bleed damage
[2:25:52] <+HefestoForges> look at that bleeding *bleeds out*
[2:25:54] <+Javaa01> Yeah they buffed bleed a lot in this game
[2:25:57] <%akajaybay> I think I must have had an easier time with these because of fast sword swings, they interrupt easy
[2:25:59] <user_naim> forgot about bleed damage
[2:26:07] <+slimefancypants> no matter how many hours in these imps are still hard to read sometimes
[2:26:17] <agustorm123> Do snail bleed?
[2:26:18] <HelghastTroop> ooh oneshots em
[2:26:22] <%MajorCrasher> Yo
[2:26:22] <HelghastTroop> thats nice
[2:26:28] <%oneimportantthing> I often struggle to actually land hits on the imps because they have a very weird and awkward height, so my sword goes over them
[2:26:33] <%GrandpaJaji> still cool tho
[2:26:35] <+GilroyGoldBlood> YEET
[2:26:37] <+HefestoForges> imp space program tho
[2:26:41] <HelghastTroop> @MajorCrasher PotFriend
[2:26:42] <xxHungryxx> Get Launched
[2:26:44] <+Javaa01> @Stupid121v2 Yeah they're just fast enough that you can never truly autopilot through them
[2:26:48] <yukichocomilk> try finger
[2:26:50] <+Javaa01> And just mash R1
[2:26:54] <%Lion_kun> Why fight them again
[2:26:55] <BlueEagle2395> PotFriend
[2:26:57] <+0neReeler> looks you get recover grey life for counter?
[2:27:00] <+Brassnarwhal> @oneimportantthing weapons with slam attacks make them easier because of this, basically any vertical strike
[2:27:02] <+Chimeraelite> Oneimportantthing just don't lock on and swing that camera down. Your sword will follow somewhat
[2:27:08] <iacus_> wait till theyre in front of the trap
[2:27:12] <+HefestoForges> woolie and a death wish
[2:27:14] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Javaa01 the twinblades do a good job of canceling them out
[2:27:24] <agustorm123> I kill them with their own trap LUL
[2:27:31] <user_naim> PotFriend
[2:27:42] <ytwitchmeng> USE TRAP
[2:27:50] <BlueEagle2395> i hate these guys
[2:28:01] <Timarkot> their weapon is so good
[2:28:04] <HelghastTroop> pick em off is only way to go
[2:28:13] <HelghastTroop> they swarm in no time
[2:28:21] <+Brassnarwhal> depends on the dungeon
[2:28:21] <xxHungryxx> Everything hurts
[2:28:25] <+GilroyGoldBlood> either that or get a 100 physical shield
[2:28:36] <shadepman> did you guys become the elden lord yet
[2:28:38] <user_naim> so does he see
[2:28:40] <+pectusumbra> yeah really need a full shield
[2:28:44] <agustorm123> Get good and don‚Äôt take damage Kappa
[2:28:45] <+Chimeraelite> Legit I started as a wretch and I barely touched faith past 13 until my Hp was like 20
[2:28:51] <+Javaa01> @GilroyGoldBlood Unfortunately that's still a little bit off cause he doesn't have the starting gear shop unlocked yet
[2:28:54] <HelghastTroop> @shadepman i became a scrublord
[2:28:57] <+solzan2000> sneaky imps
[2:29:09] <+HefestoForges> nice
[2:29:10] <+noticemepaisen> That's a lot of blood
[2:29:11] <xxHungryxx> Needs to from that Brass shield or by the heater shield
[2:29:11] <AzureSynesthesia> catacombs in general seem to be rough
[2:29:11] <+0neReeler> 'here's sips' to lower your guard
[2:29:21] <xxHungryxx> farm*
[2:29:22] <Carlioo> dedication
[2:29:23] <+AnIrishPapaya> new weapon time :)
[2:29:24] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Javaa01 I think some the brass shield some guys drop in 100 phys
[2:29:27] <%Deasmeister> hi strength weapone
[2:29:29] <Grunkle_Dan_> see what i mean? ;)
[2:29:29] <agustorm123> This place is full of blood
[2:29:31] <HelghastTroop> yeah the delay real is dogshit
[2:29:33] <+nolawg> delay is bad
[2:29:36] <+Chimeraelite> Don't forget charged strong attacks are hilariously good
[2:29:39] <HelghastTroop> not feeling great
[2:29:39] <+Brassnarwhal> i just always guard counter these guys to be safe
[2:29:40] <+0neReeler> STR builds
[2:29:45] <+nolawg> even on pc delay is badd
[2:29:46] <HelghastTroop> makes parrying feel like ass
[2:29:51] <roamgarage> Grenada in the house!
[2:29:53] <+OctaivianRex> You get fast verticals on R1 if you two hand. Kinda nice.
[2:29:54] <+Javaa01> @GilroyGoldBlood Yeah problem is, Woolie's starting class has like no Arcane, so his drop rates are really low
[2:29:57] <+AnIrishPapaya> lol its just slow sword not delay
[2:30:04] <%Reveresao> Don't forget to summon
[2:30:09] <xxHungryxx> Has he used his summons
[2:30:09] <%hax_metatron> FOR NOW
[2:30:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> This ambush room sucks
[2:30:13] <%Lion_kun> They get more complex
[2:30:14] <tubit> here we gooo
[2:30:15] <%oneimportantthing> Elden has a bit slower gameplay than DS3 which I really appreciate
[2:30:16] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Javaa01 didn't consider that
[2:30:17] <%AngryAsian5> OH SHIT
[2:30:18] <Carlioo> dude cast off his cape

[2:30:46] <agustorm123> He kratos
[2:30:47] <%akajaybay> oh yeah really need a 100 phys shield for blocks to be viable
[2:30:49] <skagtheprinceofhell> Oh it just does damage if they walk into the spell forming
[2:30:52] <%townzzzzz> bring out the pack
[2:30:53] <+OctaivianRex> @agustorm123 Let him play the game man.
[2:30:57] <stormhawk9891> This guy is a joke if you just oarry him

[2:31:01] <Afroperonista> summons LUL
[2:31:04] <+theoldone001> His Gladiator helmet is so cool, I've yet to find it if it's even in the game

[2:31:30] <+HefestoForges> is just game
[2:31:31] <agustorm123> Kratos kill this fool
[2:31:31] <shadepman> wow woolies good at spacing
[2:31:34] <user_naim> we have like 200 episodes to use summons, it‚Äôs fine
[2:31:40] <OblivionSword1> Summons might help
[2:31:43] <%notsoy> with that much damage, blocking not gonna work
[2:31:44] <%MajorCrasher> why not heal LUL
[2:31:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> This guy beat my ass in the beta
[2:31:45] <+RemedyofRevenge> yo he got that Ryu SF6 chest
[2:31:45] <+Dova573> that was a Q comand grab
[2:31:46] <+HefestoForges> myrmidon helmet just in case anyone's curious
[2:31:47] <HelghastTroop> bloodlust boiling
[2:31:48] <MadBaller123> are you not entertained
[2:31:56] <BlueEagle2395> you can do it woolie lets gooo
[2:31:57] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:31:57] <%pi_in_the_sci> yes
[2:31:59] <+GilroyGoldBlood> You can
[2:31:59] <+0neReeler> installed grab = death
[2:32:00] <iacus_> yeah but if you can see their usefulness sooner rather than later, all the best
[2:32:00] <%bruuzer12> Classic gladiator design
[2:32:01] <skagtheprinceofhell> You can sprint
[2:32:03] <Timarkot> no :)
[2:32:06] <+GilroyGoldBlood> You definitely can sprint
[2:32:06] <+SneakyBeaver102> That pose at the end was great
[2:32:11] <+nolawg> u can sprint
[2:32:14] <HelghastTroop> hes mad he hasnt killed woolsworth yet
[2:32:19] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Give it a shot
[2:32:20] <+pectusumbra> yo they dropped
[2:32:22] <+OctaivianRex> Sprinting almost always works.
[2:32:23] <SmortyPuffin> got nothing to lose
[2:32:23] <+Javaa01> These imps are fast, but not quite fast enough to keep up with you running
[2:32:25] <+kewlmyc> Bleed is a bitch
[2:32:25] <%pi_in_the_sci> no reason to speculate, just try it
[2:32:29] <%shakespearo> Praise the Woolen Ring \o/
[2:32:31] <rommlll> mind the goblins
[2:32:33] <%andre11dr> Just try it ,you dropped nothing
[2:32:33] <+pectusumbra> well damn, lost whatever that was
[2:32:34] <%bruuzer12> Sprinting never not works
[2:32:35] <NoirEvans> summoned ashes?
[2:32:35] <+HefestoForges> murmillo* dammit
[2:32:38] <+nolawg> its not that bad to sprint really
[2:32:41] <+Dakuu75> guys, he's not asking "how to sprint" he's thinking "should I sprint" LUL
[2:32:45] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Yeah, sprinting works just fine
[2:32:47] <agustorm123> Wolfs are like the easiest enemies
[2:32:48] <Grunkle_Dan_> @bruuzer12 too true
[2:32:53] <%hax_metatron> You have to try shit without fear of losing stuff in this game otherwise it can take actually forever
[2:32:54] <+0neReeler> Featuring Goblin from Goblin Slayer
[2:33:00] <%akajaybay> too slow for lil guys
[2:33:06] <+MachoMadnesss94> Just run it
[2:33:09] <+tempestzephyr> sprinting is always an option
[2:33:09] <%shakespearo> lil nasty men
[2:33:14] <+MachoMadnesss94> It‚Äôs possible
[2:33:16] <+AnIrishPapaya> he desperately needs a faster weapon/ 100 physical shield
[2:33:21] <%radiorosewater> lil goober dudes
[2:33:23] <zenith0111> This game is so damn addicting
[2:33:25] <+OrangeMDT> Could always just try running, but this is fine
[2:33:33] <HelghastTroop> @zenith0111 oh yeah it is
[2:33:41] <agustorm123> Spells oblitarate them but is better to save them for the boss
[2:33:43] <%MajorCrasher> yeah slow weapons kinda suck against these guys
[2:33:46] <%notsoy> is blocking with a non-100 shield ever a good idea in this genre?
[2:33:50] <iacus_> the imps are made of stone so you should be using the flail
[2:33:50] <NoirEvans> dog summon?
[2:33:52] <AnthroMetal> they made of rock, use a hammer
[2:33:53] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> considering how hype he was about ash, he hasnt used any yet
[2:33:57] <%akajaybay> might have enough smith stone for an upgrade now
[2:33:59] <tubit> lesgooo
[2:34:04] <+OctaivianRex> @AnIrishPapaya Sword is fine. Shield is not.
[2:34:07] <+Nekros4442> summon wolves?
[2:34:14] <+0neReeler> 100 sheild depends on starting class
[2:34:14] <%radiorosewater> sword is slash dmg, bad for rock guys

[2:34:24] <+nolawg> wow who knew sprinting works
[2:34:25] <zenith0111> @notsoy Sometimes they have better blocking like stamina, pose etc. but usually hardly worth it in the end
[2:34:30] <%akajaybay> magic damage is good
[2:34:34] <zenith0111> poise*

[2:35:31] <+0neReeler> wanna see the counter that will also stagger
[2:35:40] <+Babooboomin> need to find a better shield man
[2:35:43] <agustorm123> It kinda was the right one
[2:35:44] <+Javaa01> Yeah guard countering against bosses is a rough deal, cause they always have one more follow up then you'd initially think
[2:35:46] <%slipdog> @TheotherKristian north end of the river that leads from the lake
[2:35:47] <%oneimportantthing> Pat in the distance: "...fiiight laaaame"
[2:35:47] <%shakespearo> Summons are real good against bosses for getting some breathing room
[2:35:47] <iacus_> blocked
[2:35:52] <+AnIrishPapaya> since he has a shitty shield. I would just go all in on cerulean flasks and magic his ass
[2:35:53] <tubit> unlucky with those spells
[2:35:56] <+pupil31> SourPls
[2:35:57] <Omenaire_> what class did woolie pick?

[2:36:11] <%akajaybay> close
[2:36:11] <%townzzzzz> ass blast
[2:36:11] <+pupil31> He knows his range
[2:36:17] <+anoldtoilet> i just stopped playing elden ring. time to watch elkden ring
[2:36:17] <skagtheprinceofhell> Big shockwave
[2:36:17] <penitentpendant> @Omenaire_ Griffith (Prisoner)
[2:36:19] <Omenaire_> sick i also chose prisoner
[2:36:21] <+Nekros4442> remember you have summons woolie
[2:36:23] <agustorm123> Almost there
[2:36:25] <KaiserMario> Looks at that God of War enemy
[2:36:27] <+kewlmyc> I made the mistake of coming here 40 hours in, and 3 shot him LUL.

[2:36:34] <+Ryaotz> don't forget summons
[2:36:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember your wolf boys, they crave blood!
[2:36:38] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:36:39] <+MachoMadnesss94> You could always try the summons
[2:36:40] <%holydeviant1> Fuckin Hammer Bros
[2:36:41] <+RowenCleric> this game man
[2:36:42] <+Jiggisnipe> he noticed
[2:36:43] <%shakespearo> Can't wait to see their reaction to some later stuff. Legit had my jaw drop
[2:36:43] <zenith0111> Summons are always free
[2:36:44] <+anoldtoilet> prisoner spell is really good. i started as a samurai and went quality/int and i STILL dont have a spell as good as that
[2:36:45] <+Javaa01> @Omenaire_ Prisoner is definitely one of the better starters overall
[2:36:45] <%radiorosewater> there are no summons in ba sing sei
[2:36:50] <+OctaivianRex> Oh he was actually trying to remember.
[2:36:50] <%jonblnt> Just got here. Can woolie summon yet?
[2:36:53] <+Jiggisnipe> but will he remember when he gets to the door Kappa
[2:36:53] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Always for get to use your summons
[2:36:53] <HelghastTroop> well summons cost fp
[2:36:55] <MadBaller123> take a shot every time chat says summons
[2:36:56] <Iza_kku> @anoldtoilet i just beat elden ring, and I've already seen a few things in woolie's play through i didn't encounter
[2:36:56] <agustorm123> I gave up long ago telling him about them
[2:37:02] <+Javaa01> @jonblnt Yeah he just keeps forgetting about it
[2:37:03] <%oneimportantthing> @kewlmyc Same, there were tons of early bosses i didn't find until late in the game
[2:37:06] <%Giothegame> I guess no luck on finding a better shield for now
[2:37:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> see

[2:38:54] <+RemedyofRevenge> GGs no re shake my paw
[2:38:55] <+dandywaffles> Wolves hunt in packs
[2:38:56] <penitentpendant> Summon Swords, Summon Wolves
[2:38:57] <%jonblnt> Don‚Äôt forget about jumping attack. Summons and two handed jumping attacks fucks up bosses
[2:38:57] <HelghastTroop> protect us from urban violence
[2:39:00] <%oneimportantthing> Cryptobros yelling about shiba inu
[2:39:04] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie & Sifs VS Kratos
[2:39:05] <%whyskeywolfe> Once again Woolie and a Wolf work well together
[2:39:05] <Pappajimbo> wollie and his three wolf shirt never loses
[2:39:06] <%TubeMan642> Don'f turn your back on the wolf pack
[2:39:13] <+pectusumbra> what's that other shiny?
[2:39:14] <%slipdog> praise the tree (o)
[2:39:15] <SubjectX07x> Summon cheese is strong
[2:39:16] <+anoldtoilet> !uptime
[2:39:16] <user_naim> wolves and guns
[2:39:16] <@Moobot> @anoldtoilet WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 54 minutes
[2:39:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> Its too dangerous to go alone
[2:39:17] <iacus_> they are situational
[2:39:18] <agustorm123> And people shit on me for remembering him
[2:39:19] <%radiorosewater> can i cum
[2:39:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Not quite
[2:39:22] <%holydeviant1> Less aggressive, mstly
[2:39:24] <+GilroyGoldBlood> not really
[2:39:27] <zenith0111> No all summons are wildly different
[2:39:32] <iacus_> e.g. the sorcerer dude casts magic so he's good at a distance
[2:39:32] <AzureSynesthesia> you can upgrade summons later to make them more reliable
[2:39:37] <%akajaybay> theyre fast and strong but soft, some are hardy and many but dont do much dmg
[2:39:37] <+anoldtoilet> yeah the summons are really interesting
[2:39:39] <HelghastTroop> bigger guys always have more health
[2:39:42] <HelghastTroop> thats the rules
[2:39:45] <Wakerpl> You know what hurts? Dying with 40k runes and your blood pool spawning in the wall... Had to take a break after this
[2:39:46] <+anoldtoilet> thrre are also unique summons who are named characters
[2:39:47] <+anoldtoilet> its epic
[2:39:52] <+pectusumbra> Could 2-hand that I think?
[2:39:53] <+dandywaffles> They have low up, but there are three and they‚Äôre aggressive
[2:39:56] <user_naim> @wakerpl rip
[2:39:57] <%notsoy> oh that's a skill, not a phase transition
[2:39:59] <MadBaller123> taunt button?
[2:39:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> go through the armor
[2:40:00] <agustorm123> How do you level them up?
[2:40:09] <HelghastTroop> XD demos his moves
[2:40:12] <+dandywaffles> Low poise bosses will get stunlocked
[2:40:16] <SubjectX07x> There is one summon real late that practically voids the worth of all others
[2:40:17] <%shakespearo> @agustorm123 there is a character you meet who acts as a merchant for it
[2:40:19] <%RemedyofRevenge> RemedyofRevenge subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! The true magic of ER is that the game doesn't saddle you with a billion quest logs, way points, and a map you can't see cause its drowning in icons. Best game since DS1 imo.
[2:40:23] <HelghastTroop> unfortnate you dont swing it on a chain
[2:40:25] <%slipdog> Roars are a whole category now
[2:40:28] <tubit> it does stunlock pretty well
[2:40:32] <HelghastTroop> but cant have everything be amazing
[2:40:35] <+Dakuu75> there's a shout that buffs attack, and a sholut that does a knock back/dmg
[2:40:39] <skagtheprinceofhell> @agustorm123 Go find a lady or go to the hub and she be their and after awhile she will become the person who levels it up
[2:40:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> hell yeah
[2:40:46] <%slipdog> There's even a shout that buffs shouts SeriousSloth
[2:40:51] <+anoldtoilet> agreed yeah. its as open as ds1 it feels, but its much much bigger
[2:41:00] <skagtheprinceofhell> @slipdog You bullshit? Truly?
[2:41:00] <Wakerpl> you meant Bloodborne right? :D
[2:41:09] <LeeOhX> is the stamina meter off outside of combat?
[2:41:09] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Roll attack
[2:41:10] <+SneakyBeaver102> That‚Äôs a good meat mallet right there
[2:41:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> it needs to explode when swung
[2:41:16] <+pectusumbra> what's the shiny next to the warp?
[2:41:16] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Roll attack and backstep
[2:41:18] <%Cherokia666> I've been using that Hammer for the past couple of days now. It's really good
[2:41:19] <shadepman> we monster hunter in here
[2:41:23] <HelghastTroop> you actually go pretty far in areas that would kick your ass in this game
[2:41:26] <zenith0111> DS1 wasnt that open tbh because of the Orange Fog Doors
[2:41:28] <%slipdog> No dung detected
[2:41:29] <agustorm123> He used two of them
[2:41:30] <OblivionSword1> 2 handed moveset ?
[2:41:33] <Blank9> Crouch R1 gives you roll attack without moving
[2:42:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> they're all different LUL
[2:42:09] <%MutedMimic> woolieSMUG My main wep right now
[2:42:13] <Louie_Salmon> I think the past, running and backstabbing were the same attack.
[2:42:18] <+GilroyGoldBlood> yeah, there's an attack out of crouch as well
[2:42:21] <+Grayhammatter> oh snap, woolie got the hammer
[2:42:22] <TheyCallMeVawn> Wrong
[2:42:22] <HelghastTroop> some moves are just more elaborate on some weapons
[2:42:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> there are many many moves
[2:42:25] <agustorm123> Baratheon weapon
[2:42:32] <%slipdog> Jumping light and heavy can be different too
[2:42:33] <+anoldtoilet> yeah it seems like they made movesets pretty expansive
[2:42:41] <+anoldtoilet> a lot of stuff has unique r2 vs charge r2 as well
[2:42:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> stealth mode
[2:42:44] <HelghastTroop> its like ultra greatswords didnt have much of anymoves
[2:42:44] <%akajaybay> swing seems a little faster than sword which is surprising
[2:42:49] <+anoldtoilet> like charging will give you an additional hit or different move
[2:42:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> BOP
[2:42:50] <tubit> roll attack
[2:42:53] <%RemedyofRevenge> iirc in DS1 neutral backstep and sprinting R1 typically had the same attack animation
[2:42:54] <HelghastTroop> mostly all downward swings
[2:43:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> heavy and charged heavy
[2:43:00] <HelghastTroop> with sweeps sometimes
[2:43:06] <+Chimeraelite> Yessir. Every weapon a playthrough it's so fucking great
[2:43:19] <+Grayhammatter> you don't have another hammer
[2:43:20] <skagtheprinceofhell> Start up is slower but the actual full swing is faster because momentum
[2:43:22] <HelghastTroop> ehh daggers kinda suck still
[2:43:30] <HelghastTroop> but i havent seen them much
[2:43:32] <Blank9> Power stance is great in this
[2:43:34] <%slipdog> try it on those Stone Imps
[2:43:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Time to TENDERIZE SOME MEAT
[2:43:38] <%AllenDeadman> hit things with it and they die
[2:43:41] <+Jiggisnipe> eww gross
[2:43:46] <skagtheprinceofhell> Wait, what about the grace?
[2:43:47] <HelghastTroop> yeah cool that theres power stance with all the weapon types
[2:43:53] <+anoldtoilet> this game seems to get a little extreme with strike/pierce/slash resist
[2:43:57] <%akajaybay> oh they might take more crush dmg huh
[2:43:57] <%slipdog> some enemies are a puzzle
[2:44:00] <emptyantics> Jump attacks with dual stancing are broken as fuck
[2:44:03] <+anoldtoilet> like its actually valuable to have a weapon with a stab, and maybe a pocket hammer
[2:44:16] <%Jakeofalco> spend souls plz
[2:44:17] <%hax_metatron> They're all different
[2:44:18] <HelghastTroop> @anoldtoilet dark souls always goes crazy with armor bros
[2:44:23] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> what determines if a weapon duplicates itself  in your offhand, or whether it gets 2-handed?
[2:44:24] <stormhawk9891> Those fuckers are annoying even way later in the game
[2:44:27] <%hax_metatron> The dungeons here are all almost always unique
[2:44:29] <%radiorosewater> send souls plz\
[2:44:29] <%slipdog> Yes, but actually no :)
[2:44:31] <HelghastTroop> and stone is jsut natures armor
[2:44:38] <+pectusumbra> hammer might be good vs those oozes?
[2:44:40] <resloxxx> will he find the boy I wonder
[2:44:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> I haven't seen anyone go through here from this end
[2:44:46] <+Jaromero435> D:
[2:44:49] <+Jiggisnipe> monkaS
[2:44:53] <+Grayhammatter> D:
[2:44:53] <%slipdog> NOO theyre friendly!
[2:44:53] <agustorm123> I would have loved this kind of dungeons in BOTW
[2:44:53] <+solzan2000> uh oh
[2:44:55] <@Menitta> nooo
[2:44:56] <+Catpurnicus> Metroids!
[2:44:57] <emptyantics> What is the best armor set and why is it the one D has Kreygasm
[2:44:58] <%shakespearo> NO, they are shaped like a friend
[2:44:59] <+Jaromero435> they did nothing wrong D:
[2:45:00] <%radiorosewater> uhhh
[2:45:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> 14 runes LUL
[2:45:06] <HelghastTroop> @„Çª„Éì„Éº you jsut ahve to ahve same weapon type to dual stance it
[2:45:06] <+kewlmyc> Big red squirts? Might need to go see a doctor.
[2:45:06] <%shakespearo> YOU'RE HOSTILE
[2:45:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> monkaS

[2:47:52] <+Jiggisnipe> oh it's a script?
[2:47:52] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> im convinced
[2:47:53] <+0neReeler> he coming
[2:47:58] <penitentpendant> Every time I see him run up I think of that Monty Python scene
[2:48:02] <HelghastTroop> EXACTLY
[2:48:04] <%holydeviant1> @nolawg "These jellyfish? EVIL. This ally and friend? READY TO KILL ME"
[2:48:05] <CappuccinoGuil> It's real cool they flip the spawn point for Nerijus depending on which angle you come into the area
[2:48:07] <+Grayhammatter> oh lawd he comin
[2:48:07] <zenith0111> OH LORD HE COMIN

[2:48:48] <majindusto> YURA, YURA, YURA
[2:48:49] <%shakespearo> I feel asleep last stream, have they even been to the hold yet?
[2:48:51] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> oh yeah, that helper is rad
[2:48:53] <%holydeviant1> BLEED IS BIG in  this game
[2:48:53] <+Chimeraelite> It's lit if you want to use it
[2:48:54] <@Solidus_113> THIS IS DARK SOULS
[2:49:02] <+0neReeler> that spell is far but he runs all the way upto first how nice

[2:50:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> Was that a Warframe weapon?
[2:50:03] <+GallowsDrop> Pat had that Dagger!!!! it's super strong!
[2:50:07] <emptyantics> Yura Kreygasm
[2:50:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> Reduvia is some dangerous shit in pvp
[2:50:10] <%agianttornado> they are so close to the cave
[2:50:12] <+pectusumbra> Craftable
[2:50:14] <+TheEvilOmega> You can craft those.
[2:50:21] <+Maleicus> its not that strong
[2:50:22] <Blank9> Love me some reduvia
[2:50:22] <+Grayhammatter> easily craftable
[2:50:24] <+GilroyGoldBlood> cave :)
[2:50:29] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> oh so thats where reduvia is from, i see it mentioned a bunch
[2:50:29] <+anoldtoilet> yeah. npc invaders will always trigger though
[2:50:32] <%agianttornado> cave
[2:50:35] <Wakerpl> there's a cave nearby if I remember correctly
[2:50:36] <centuronstar> Those are pretty easily craftable too.
[2:50:45] <%holydeviant1> There IS a resource that empowers you until you die, but that's for later.
[2:50:45] <+devonoel> reduvia my mvp <3
[2:50:46] <%shakespearo> this game really needs a thing to show you new items in your inventory because I constantly search for the shit I just picked up
[2:50:47] <HelghastTroop> ypu its the important cave
[2:50:48] <+Jiggisnipe> blud
[2:50:51] <%RemedyofRevenge> I get why they did that, but part of me wishes you could turn on invasions always
[2:50:53] <centuronstar> They used some pretty common flowers
[2:50:54] <%CavemanInCave> WOOL LEE  woolieVS RED G woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB woolieCRAB
[2:50:56] <+theoldone001> Code Vein Sword
[2:51:01] <+GallowsDrop> this thing is great
[2:51:05] <HelghastTroop> yeah the bloodborne dagger
[2:51:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DATS A GOOD KNIFE
[2:51:13] <+pectusumbra> Blades of BLOOD
[2:51:13] <CappuccinoGuil> You can't use the Weapon Art until you meet the requirements. Real good knife, though
[2:51:13] <huskarl_zap> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[2:51:14] <+Chimeraelite> Weapon arts are LIT
[2:51:15] <%shakespearo> EDGE
[2:51:16] <+pupil31> Fear The Blood
[2:51:16] <LeeOhX> never drying is so fucking cool
[2:51:17] <KaiserMario> Dats the good shit
[2:51:18] <+Kawaso> that's sick
[2:51:18] <+anoldtoilet> that weapon art inflicts bleed mad fast
[2:51:19] <Wobuzhidao> This knife is Pat approved
[2:51:21] <%holydeviant1> IT'S A DAMN GOOD KNIFE
[2:51:22] <+GilroyGoldBlood> :) cave
[2:51:28] <orochiblood> theres a Katana that does this kinda but its FTH based
[2:51:30] <%notsoy> blood waves, some BB shit
[2:51:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Pat killed a dragon with this very exacto knife
[2:51:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[2:51:31] <%agianttornado> cave
[2:51:32] <+devonoel> bandit chads rise up
[2:51:33] <orochiblood> i mean ARC
[2:51:35] <+sevorai> Bleed is so broken in this game
[2:51:40] <+pectusumbra> hey, arcane isn't bad to boost anyway
[2:51:53] <zenith0111> Arcane is item discovery, health and stuff
[2:51:55] <+Javaa01> Yeah if you wanna use the edgy blood stuff, you gotta build Arcane
[2:51:59] <HelghastTroop> theres like a million weapon in this game that use intelligence/ faith
[2:52:02] <Voidvas> BLEED  is fucking Broken
[2:52:05] <%holydeviant1> "I need a reason" WOOLIE. THIS DAGGER BE A REASON. BLEED IS BIG
[2:52:06] <HelghastTroop> its kinda annoying
[2:52:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Do you want to shoot blood waves like Nerijus did?
[2:52:12] <Sopapiglobo100> bleed is a legit option against some enemies
[2:52:17] <%MajorCrasher> use L2
[2:52:17] <%Indigo_Automaton> Arcane is basically Bloodtinge + Luck
[2:52:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> but think of all the loot
[2:52:21] <huskarl_zap> Arcane is for bleed and almost magics
[2:52:21] <+TheEvilOmega> Bleed will body certain enemies.
[2:52:22] <+pectusumbra> but is it COOL to woolie
[2:52:23] <KaiserMario> If it bleeds you can kill it
[2:52:24] <+anoldtoilet> arcane is less item discovery and more status effect proc, and also CERTAIN spells
[2:52:25] <%agianttornado> cave
[2:52:26] <linSP> Just got here, did woolie aquire the blood knife
[2:52:29] <+GilroyGoldBlood> cave :)
[2:52:29] <%holydeviant1> @Sopapiglobo100 Bleed works on anything with blood.
[2:52:30] <+anoldtoilet> theres some faith spells that need arcane
[2:52:33] <%shakespearo> gear isreally important in this tho, so item discovery ain't a waste either
[2:52:33] <%CavemanInCave> cave
[2:52:33] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> yup
[2:52:33] <+anoldtoilet> and maybe others
[2:52:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> @MajorCrasher doesn't have the stats
[2:52:36] <BreakfastSampler> @linSP literally just got it
[2:52:36] <%andre11dr> Arcane also effects certain spells
[2:52:38] <centuronstar> That's a weird attribute to assign that to. I would've figured it would've been just Dex based
[2:52:38] <linSP> nice
[2:52:41] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie says no to Lucky Ted
[2:52:42] <%Reveresao> @WoolieVersus teleport back to the cave and go to jellyfish area
[2:52:43] <@Menitta> I'm not putting much into arcane.
[2:52:51] <HelghastTroop> we almost there
[2:52:53] <HelghastTroop> so excited
[2:52:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Don't know about sorcery, but going Miracles means you REALLY need Arcane for the dope shit
[2:53:03] <+pectusumbra> @Reveresao it's right behind him he can just go back
[2:53:10] <%Jakeofalco> @WoolieVersus head back under the arch
[2:53:17] <+GilroyGoldBlood> AWWW
[2:53:17] <+anoldtoilet> i have 8 arcane and 8 faith and im doing sorcery and dex mostly, but 18 str for a specific weapon

[3:18:59] <%sirisvirus> Voodoo Fetish is an item for rituals
[3:19:00] <+Jiggisnipe> juju
[3:19:02] <penitentpendant> Grace Fetish, people perving on their save points
[3:19:05] <Puhff> Like a Vergil figurine Keepo
[3:19:07] <some_brave_apollo> a fetish is like a worship object, a sexual fetish is an object you find sexually attractive eg high heeled shoe
[3:19:10] <%kewlmyc> So the Cross is a fetish Kappa
[3:19:10] <mihokspawn> Eidolon, fetish, totem...
[3:19:10] <CoffeeSlice> bad juju
[3:19:11] <+pectusumbra> a talisman, totem, so on. It's the original meaning of the word.
[3:19:12] <%slipdog> woolieSHOOKREG woolieSHOOKREG woolieSHOOKREG
[3:19:14] <+RigmaroleHM> How that turned into sexy time I don't know
[3:19:15] <%Irridium> a lucky foot, one could say
[3:19:16] <skagtheprinceofhell> @penitentpendant I mean, Rule 34.
[3:19:16] <+dandywaffles> Like a talisman
[3:19:16] <+lightbringrrrr> like a kirby doll
[3:19:18] <nip_nips> grace mimic is a joke item
[3:19:20] <+Jiggisnipe> false idols Kappa
[3:19:20] <%BigBruthaThunda> I prefer to call it a poop totem
[3:19:24] <SulfurousAcid> üë†
[3:19:26] <HelghastTroop> Fertility Fetish Kappa
[3:19:27] <penitentpendant> @skagtheprinceofhell Exactly
[3:19:27] <Louie_Salmon> So it's an item that you're horny for, you have a fetish about that specific item
[3:19:28] <+dandywaffles> A rabbits foot
[3:19:30] <%holydeviant1> Points at Points of Interest, IIRC
[3:19:31] <Puhff> but wut do it do tho
[3:19:32] <+Clievile> pretty sure it just shows you the nearest grace
[3:19:34] <+Kyma1020> mimic bonfire
[3:19:40] <+Shoosler> what class did Woolie start as?
[3:19:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1498566821108228097?s=20&t=pXnUDOSgpoKV-ebdFPvSIg
[3:19:41] <+Clievile> like if you
[3:19:42] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Undiscovered grace then?
[3:19:43] <Louie_Salmon> @nip_nips It's super useful though
[3:19:43] <Monkeyweed21> Invaders can put it down to screw with you
[3:19:46] <+tempestzephyr> is it a trap for invaders?
[3:19:48] <+Clievile> are exploring and need to find a new one asap
[3:19:49] <Puhff> Does it just give you a ray to point you to a nearby grace?
[3:19:50] <skagtheprinceofhell> @RigmaroleHM Coveting and wanting another or a specific thing with another. Not that hard of a stretch really.
[3:19:51] <Wakerpl> @Shoosler prisoner
[3:19:54] <HelghastTroop> @Shoosler prisoner
[3:19:55] <+AnIrishPapaya> no
[3:19:57] <+pectusumbra> Noooo wayyyyy
[3:19:57] <+Kyma1020> oh
[3:19:57] <@Solidus_113> no
[3:19:58] <+Jaromero435> no
[3:19:58] <+Shoosler> thx
[3:19:58] <%Indigo_Automaton> They're fake bonfires for pvp traps
[3:20:00] <TheyCallMeVawn> No
[3:20:01] <%Deasmeister> no
[3:20:01] <OblivionSword1> no it is not
[3:20:01] <%notsoy> no, they wouldn't make portable bonfires for 100
[3:20:02] <Louie_Salmon> No
[3:20:04] <MyNameIsRasus> that's not true
[3:20:05] <%notsoy> HELL no they wouldn't
[3:20:05] <HelghastTroop> nope
[3:20:05] <+lightbringrrrr> no
[3:20:08] <HelghastTroop> false
[3:20:08] <+Dakuu75> I still don't know what a grace mimic does, I assume it turns your into a grace for PVP
[3:20:10] <kazadaz> Only $100
[3:20:11] <+GilroyGoldBlood> lmao
[3:20:11] <%slipdog> Pvp troll items
[3:20:11] <+Kyma1020> fake bonfire for pvp
[3:20:12] <+Grayhammatter> doesn't seem like it, no
[3:20:14] <CappuccinoGuil> You should probably get 10k for those big items there, ti's good shit
[3:20:14] <Monkeyweed21> its a fake bonfire for pvp
[3:20:15] <+anoldtoilet> @Indigo_Automaton lol i was wondering if they worked like that
[3:20:17] <+anoldtoilet> thats epic
[3:20:23] <xxHungryxx> Prisoner. Sentenced to life for stealing pies
[3:20:25] <+dandywaffles> It‚Äôs a fancy thing that points you in the general direction of progress
[3:20:38] <+AnIrishPapaya> just guides you to the nearest grace site
[3:20:39] <+Clievile> now THAT is a good item ot get
[3:20:39] <HelghastTroop> that finger evil as shit just look at it
[3:20:41] <+anoldtoilet> pvp guarantees the odds arent on your side in elden ring but its cool how many ways you have to prank people
[3:20:42] <+Clievile> to*
[3:20:42] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus The Stonesword Keys you can think like Pharros Lockstones in DS2. Always try to have some on hand.
[3:20:45] <linSP> Red eye psaOrb
[3:20:58] <SubjectX07x> Apparently you can completely miss patches if you visit the cave too late. :/
[3:21:00] <+Dakuu75> @dandywaffles oh fuck, really. (I need to buy some of those)
[3:21:03] <RickyRelucent> fake bonfires will go out if style, should be fun though and domething to ve wary of
[3:21:05] <+Clievile> now they're rare but not obscenely rare.
[3:21:05] <+pectusumbra> you could get one as a starting gift
[3:21:10] <+segmentedfool> Also don't be afraid to use them, there are a massive amount of them all over the world
[3:21:11] <Wakerpl> I've never regretted using one, so having them is worth it
[3:21:14] <KaiserMario> Good old Pharos still up to his shennanigans
[3:21:15] <exnuart> its a fun little run that place
[3:21:15] <w_khan> Stoneswords are good to have
[3:21:20] <+Clievile> male maiden?
[3:21:23] <+theoldone001> One thing people barely noticed is how Durability is straight up gone lol
[3:21:26] <Afroperonista> KappaPride
[3:21:29] <HelghastTroop> Pickled foot!!!
[3:21:30] <+invader_rin> progressive
[3:21:32] <+Clievile> trans rights
[3:21:39] <RickyRelucent> incentivises pvp
[3:21:39] <%JetpackMcQuack> or, anxiously aquire as many as they'll give
[3:21:53] <CappuccinoGuil> @theoldone001 even when I figured that out, I STILL would go "oh no, I hit a wall, my durability! wait..."
[3:21:59] <%notsoy> do parrying daggers have different timing than shields?
[3:22:07] <+Clievile> the hand ballista FUCKS thing is insane
[3:22:09] <%slipdog> invasion rewards are pretty bad at the moment, although its a lot of fun with the free teleports
[3:22:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @theoldone001 I guess the latest souls memory for people is DS3 in which bonfires healed weapons, so you'd have to really try to break them
[3:22:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Might be better than your current shield?
[3:22:19] <+Javaa01> Unfortunately the parrying dagger has pretty bad crit damage scaling, even among daggers
[3:22:19] <%Irridium> yo the hand ballista FUCKS
[3:22:26] <chimeraxmachina> @clievile hell yeah bunnnTR
[3:22:27] <+Clievile> no skill is great
[3:22:27] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Square
[3:22:31] <KaiserMario> LUL
[3:22:34] <okramv> Good passive yo
[3:22:35] <Puhff> booo not 100 physical
[3:22:37] <%akajaybay> the no skill is nice so you can have your sword special on LT without two handing
[3:22:38] <+Clievile> you want it for that weapon art alone
[3:22:44] <kazadaz> 100% shields are weirdly rare
[3:22:47] <tanarath> Is woolie looking for a 100% phys shield?
[3:22:48] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Ring of sacrifice woo
[3:22:48] <+pectusumbra> ring
[3:22:49] <CappuccinoGuil> There's a free 100% shield you can get on the way to the castle.
[3:22:53] <+BananaSlammuh> Are they on PS5?
[3:23:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @BananaSlammuh yes
[3:23:01] <%radiorosewater> @BananaSlammuh yes
[3:23:03] <linSP> I found two 100% shields 30 hours in
[3:23:05] <+Clievile> @kazadaz they arent really in my experience
[3:23:05] <+BananaSlammuh> thanks
[3:23:07] <RickyRelucent> maybe its also meant like a red soapstone/gravelord
[3:23:10] <tanarath> The turtle shield is 100% too, it's on the map, not a drop
[3:23:19] <+pectusumbra> OH. You can SELL in this game. That's something
[3:23:21] <Puhff> yeah turle shield is great
[3:23:23] <+segmentedfool> I have only found 3 100% shields after like 35 hours
[3:23:29] <+dandywaffles> Ring of sacrifice
[3:23:33] <+segmentedfool> medium shields I mean
[3:23:36] <megaman_sentinel> that's to be expected that's a Perry buckler
[3:23:37] <HelghastTroop> also some merchants sell shields so its no problem
[3:23:39] <kazadaz> Yah I've found 1 in 18 hours
[3:23:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @pectusumbra it ain't bad prices either. But it's not like in BB where you'd get thousands for a single item
[3:23:43] <+Javaa01> Yeah the crafting manuals are worth grabbing
[3:23:43] <+segmentedfool> great shields are everywhere
[3:23:44] <HelghastTroop> liek patches here of courrse
[3:23:45] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Also, look under the name, it says "No skill"
[3:23:48] <+Clievile> oh yeah, notice you can SELL for runes in this game, it's handy, you get a lot of duplicate drops
[3:23:51] <%MajorCrasher> @pectusumbra you can sell in Bloodborne and to certain npcs in DS2 forward
[3:23:53] <+Dakuu75> duel wield shields
[3:24:05] <linSP> So glad you can actually sell in this game
[3:24:11] <%RemedyofRevenge> no skill huh Kappa
[3:24:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sell some pocket souls I guess
[3:24:15] <+Clievile> @Dakuu75 hell yeah double shield lets goooo
[3:24:17] <+Exicuren> Hmmm the description implies that it shows you the main quest marque or somethng?
[3:24:17] <HelghastTroop> unfortunate there is no power stance shields
[3:24:23] <+dandywaffles> Try one, it‚Äôs only 100
[3:24:29] <kazadaz> I never noticed that cookbooks tell you exactly what they give
[3:24:30] <@Solidus_113> that's what you grind off screen for
[3:24:32] <%Reveresao> The knights golden shield is 100% and no skill
[3:24:37] <+GilroyGoldBlood> looks nice too
[3:24:39] <HelghastTroop> i just want to wack dudes with planks of wood
[3:24:44] <niddron> ashes if war is doing some kind goblins with me
[3:24:46] <+pectusumbra> correct
[3:24:47] <%slipdog> spectacular item ahead
[3:24:47] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Yes 800
[3:24:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Reveresao well...if they drop it
[3:24:52] <+Brassnarwhal> i believe the grace thing points you towards the nearest site of grace, i only did a little bit of testing cause one of the mats doesnt seem to drop very often
[3:24:57] <CappuccinoGuil> You can see how much a Rune gives by looking in the Sell menu.
[3:25:00] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Selling is the same as consuming those
[3:25:05] <AwesomeInABox> you can sell the runes
[3:25:05] <w_khan> i like how this game is more "get item and them level up for it" than the others
[3:25:11] <BreakfastSampler> @KaiserMario yeah but then you don't get a neat sound
[3:25:12] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I love anything with horses on it. Big Rohan vibes
[3:25:12] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> im always a fan of those teardrop shields
[3:25:18] <niddron> can you remove ashes of war from a weapon?
[3:25:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think viking shields were like that
[3:25:27] <%Lion_kun> you can sell souls instead of popping them for the same value
[3:25:31] <KaiserMario> @BreakfastSampler Just to save some time in some situations
[3:25:33] <%Lion_kun> saves time
[3:25:37] <nip_nips> reggie pls
[3:25:37] <BreakfastSampler> @KaiserMario mr strummer
[3:25:38] <some_brave_apollo> from doesn't understand how shields are held
[3:25:39] <@Solidus_113> you can also just sell the gold runes for their full worth, no need to menu pop them
[3:25:41] <+0neReeler> when he blocks it it will show
[3:25:43] <KaiserMario> Also dont have to do math
[3:25:50] <kazadaz> No you gotta put the round part at the front of the plane, it's more aerodynamic
[3:25:52] <%Lion_kun> I remember Matt having that exact same conversation in the ds3 lp
[3:25:53] <+GilroyGoldBlood> try blocking as an example
[3:25:54] <+Shoosler> that's for larger shields
[3:26:03] <+Nekros4442> woolie jist block andnshow
[3:26:10] <HelghastTroop> less stability if you have shield horizontal
[3:26:10] <Timarkot> @solidus_113 but the animation tho
[3:26:14] <+vaporousTippler> Woolie still on that kite kick, huh?
[3:26:16] <+GilroyGoldBlood> yeah, it's just faster
[3:26:17] <%Lion_kun> you welcome buddy
[3:26:18] <+Jiggisnipe> that's cool
[3:26:19] <+Clievile> yeah that reminds me of the DS3 Cinders mod
[3:26:19] <+Dakuu75> oh, I didn't know that
[3:26:20] <AzureSynesthesia> that's how it was in ds3
[3:26:27] <%holydeviant1> It also tells yu what they're worth!
[3:26:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> also a nice way to see how much they're worth
[3:26:31] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh we doing this?

[3:36:48] <+anoldtoilet> st trina is an epic femboy
[3:36:50] <kazadaz> An arrow that makes you fall asleep is an insane concept honestly
[3:36:52] <%slipdog> if it was bloodborne i'd have already restarted my character
[3:36:52] <emptyantics> ST Trina Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm

[3:38:03] <%slipdog> i think bosses become Drowsy
[3:38:08] <Idon__> 1000 will be a drop in the bucket one day
[3:38:14] <skagtheprinceofhell> I know you can bleed bosses, but they let you put bosses to sleep?
[3:38:17] <+Clievile> @MajorCrasher idk but you can sleep some really powerful and big non-boss enemies
[3:38:21] <%JetpackMcQuack> how often do you stumble across an emporeum
[3:38:33] <%Reveresao> take off torch?
[3:38:37] <+Clievile> @JetpackMcQuack kinda often, weirdly enough
[3:38:38] <skagtheprinceofhell> @JetpackMcQuack Like... every area you go to?
[3:38:44] <Louie_Salmon> Some bosses are immune to some effects, some have such a ridiculously high tolerance that you can't practically inflict status
[3:38:53] <+vaderxyz1970> Is Souls borne weight in Pounds or Kilo's?
[3:39:03] <%slipdog> Yes
[3:39:06] <RickyRelucent> elden ring us gonna end up being medieval fantasy monhun
[3:39:13] <HelghastTroop> almost all bosses in souls games never take poison
[3:39:21] <+Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus mark that merchant on your map bro-sif~
[3:39:24] <+Shoosler> arrows equipped
[3:39:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to be fair you're wearing some pretty heavy armor
[3:39:28] <dan_g_v> farming knight
[3:39:28] <+Clievile> @HelghastTroop you can poison bosses in this game for sure
[3:39:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> probably Kilos
[3:39:31] <w_khan> The torch is very usefull tho
[3:39:38] <kazadaz> That helmet makes you look like Harry du Bois
[3:39:47] <HelghastTroop> @HelghastTroop okay then wasnt sure so never bothered
[3:39:48] <+pectusumbra> are gloves lighter than hat? Might be a better way to keep torch on hand?
[3:39:53] <%holydeviant1> Does the Torch increase Focus? I noticed the madness and sleep bars pop up.
[3:39:56] <+Clievile> go to that tiny glowing post for a MAP
[3:40:02] <KaiserMario> Banner
[3:40:02] <+Dakuu75> I like to use diamond for merchants
[3:40:12] <iacus_> no "portal" marker sadly
[3:40:13] <%slipdog> Diamond or Horse IMO
[3:40:17] <dan_g_v> house or fortress?
[3:40:19] <+Shoosler> @holydeviant1 i think that is from the shield
[3:40:23] <wandelmilch> dog
[3:40:24] <HelghastTroop> use the skull Kappa
[3:40:25] <+dandywaffles> I use chests to mark merchants
[3:40:25] <+vaderxyz1970> @kazadaz I made my character look like him cuz I found his mustache and called him Tequila Sunset
[3:40:29] <+Dakuu75> I think flag is more "npc, flag-quest"
[3:40:29] <+Clievile> the little symbol to the top left of the TREE
[3:40:29] <wandelmilch> he has a dog with him
[3:40:32] <dan_g_v> horse for jump pads?
[3:40:32] <niddron> that's a dog Woolie
[3:40:33] <+Dakuu75> but, do you~ <3
[3:40:40] <+pectusumbra> Now to go fight that bear

[3:41:03] <+Jiggisnipe> Wildlife Killer Woolie
[3:41:04] <%Reveresao> checkout the map
[3:41:13] <kazadaz> The TP traps are weird because you can often just TP home, but it feels like cheating somehow
[3:41:20] <+Clievile> @Reveresao he doesnt have it, I was trying to give him a hint lol
[3:41:22] <RickyRelucent> @dandy : o nice idea

[3:53:23] <+aaymon86> This is gonna be bad lol
[3:53:23] <%TheHateFish> @zerointelligence000 Far from, though it's necessary for a "side" quest that's very cool and very, VERY long
[3:53:30] <HelghastTroop> its mushroom put in the pizza oven
[3:53:32] <Louie_Salmon> There is an icon of where it goes
[3:53:46] <FrostedZaibatsu> There is a sort button @WoolieVersus
[3:53:49] <%slipdog> maybe do a chunk after you collect so many things from a zone/faction
[3:53:52] <RickyRelucent> FamilyMan üçÑ in oven
[3:53:52] <+anoldtoilet> crafting items have lore
[3:53:52] <%holydeviant1> There's a little icon that tells you what part of your sack it goes to
[3:53:53] <+Clievile> honestly the crafting material doesn't have any really significant lore or anything you can mostly skip them
[3:53:53] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[3:54:00] <+anoldtoilet> no they do lol
[3:54:01] <+pectusumbra> fire bomb fire bomb!
[3:54:04] <KaiserMario> Cool shroom
[3:54:07] <megaman_sentinel> a viscous fluid
[3:54:07] <+anoldtoilet> its pretty cool
[3:54:08] <+Clievile> its basically just flowery words every time, no real lore
[3:54:18] <%akajaybay> I mean it just mentioned the eternal city so there's lore on them shrooms
[3:54:21] <+anoldtoilet> most common stuff doesnt but rare materials like that will often have actual lore
[3:54:22] <HelghastTroop> friendly mushroom, MUSHY FRIEND
[3:54:29] <KeiganOfAstora> Does Patches go back to the same cave after awhile? He didn't when I went back after the transport
[3:54:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Clievile that's souls lore tho
[3:54:48] <+Nekros4442> horse works here btw
[3:54:48] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Just a larger pocket soul
[3:54:53] <Louie_Salmon> It might make sense to do like Death Stranding, and save up items to read them en masse
[3:54:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:54:53] <HelghastTroop> @KeiganOfAstora he goes to new spot dont worry
[3:54:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> heyyyy they found it!
[3:55:00] <KeiganOfAstora> @HelghastTroop Where?!?!
[3:55:01] <+Clievile> @ReallyBigRocks this game is different in that it actually does have legit straight forward lore
[3:55:06] <RickyRelucent> inb4 chased be a cthulu sized shroom for collecting fungi
[3:55:08] <iacus_> sort of
[3:55:12] <HelghastTroop> @KeiganOfAstora sw around the lake
[3:55:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Golden Runes do have different descriptions depending on their sizes, so remember to read them before spending
[3:55:17] <%plsunbanmyacc> i say come back later
[3:55:17] <CappuccinoGuil> You can fast travel now
[3:55:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeeeah, peek your head in ang gtfo
[3:55:22] <+aaymon86> You can mount in this area.
[3:55:24] <FrostedZaibatsu> Dont worry, the game pushes back
[3:55:28] <%akajaybay> dont forget you can always tp right back to the region you werr working on before
[3:55:31] <+aaymon86> Makes running faster lol
[3:55:33] <+Clievile> do your "swing on an enemy and find out" test
[3:55:35] <%pi_in_the_sci> Now that you've sat down you can teleport out
[3:55:37] <+OniOniOniiii> this was basically the first area i did lol i was incredibly lost the entire time
[3:55:38] <%Double_Tap_That> I think you can call Torrent here
[3:55:55] <@Solidus_113> you can in fact horse and summon here
[3:55:57] <+anoldtoilet> herba dew
[3:56:01] <+Clievile> oh yeah you can use horse here
[3:56:02] <orochiblood> this place is big, you can definitely horse ride
[3:56:04] <zerointelligence000> I feel like this might be for endgame because a certain enemy FUCKS me up
[3:56:12] <KeiganOfAstora> @HelghastTroop Which lake?
[3:56:13] <zerointelligence000> but I might also be bad
[3:56:23] <iacus_> you're technically "inside" but in a wide open area
[3:56:25] <+Javaa01> Yeah this place is big enough that you still need the horse
[3:56:30] <+Clievile> wow thats the most specific message ive ever seen lmao
[3:56:34] <sirrice77> it's more of a midgame area
[3:56:35] <HelghastTroop> @KeiganOfAstora lake luriena, the acadmey lake
[3:56:35] <+aaymon86> That was the most detailed message I've ever seen lol
[3:56:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> a few
[3:56:37] <%jonblnt> Appraise that shit
[3:56:37] <linSP> I got a cool but pretty useless spell here
[3:56:39] <iacus_> these guys are very resistant
[3:56:41] <%holydeviant1> These guys are so sloooooooooow.
[3:56:41] <user_naim> thanks grrm
[3:56:44] <+theoldone001> Yeah MUCKY B O I S
[3:56:46] <TheyCallMeVawn> This is a ZONE zone
[3:56:47] <majindusto> No Bearings...Only Confusion
[3:56:50] <+pectusumbra> just a little closer
[3:56:53] <VincentGraves> has Woolie heard of the recent Artesian builds controversy?
[3:56:55] <iacus_> they are dangerous in number but trivial one on one
[3:56:55] <+Clievile> @theoldone001 nah these arent the ape men
[3:56:58] <user_naim> the implications of the horse are staggering
[3:57:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> how bad could it possibly be
[3:57:01] <+Clievile> they're the MINERS
[3:57:03] <KaiserMario> LUL
[3:57:08] <iacus_> You may also craft bone darts to lure out enemies
[3:57:09] <HelghastTroop> its rock monster
[3:57:14] <+Nekros4442> you ready to play dynasty warriors?
[3:57:16] <%Reverend_Roscoe> good luck
[3:57:17] <+pupil31> monkaS
[3:57:17] <%IronOhki> @iacus_ Boy is that great and cheap.
[3:57:19] <+Vigonept> thats a enemy
[3:57:20] <%JetpackMcQuack> monkaS
[3:57:22] <%Pillagius> Honestly with these magic blades you need to find a katana and blue coat ASAP, Woolie
[3:57:25] <+Clievile> they're super duper slow btw
[3:57:25] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I love the combat music here
[3:57:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> this song is so stressful
[3:57:27] <%jonblnt> Slow and steady
[3:57:31] <HelghastTroop> hes got a glowing stick
[3:57:34] <+anoldtoilet> lol just no flinch
[3:57:35] <HelghastTroop> better watch it
[3:57:36] <Zayasu> monkaS
[3:57:36] <+theoldone001> Moonveil Katana is my shit. I love it
[3:57:38] <+anoldtoilet> he said a piece of paper
[3:57:39] <zerointelligence000> aw lawd he comin
[3:57:44] <%jonblnt> These boys are hardy
[3:57:47] <+pupil31> monkaS
[3:57:51] <iacus_> the hardy boys
[3:57:54] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:57:58] <+Vigonept> no fp
[3:58:00] <%akajaybay> summon is up
[3:58:01] <HelghastTroop> this ost is great tho
[3:58:04] <+Clievile> no FP
[3:58:05] <+GilroyGoldBlood> You had no fp so it was weak
[3:58:05] <+Proxzo> Hulk Smash
[3:58:08] <+pectusumbra> seem very weak to backstaps
[3:58:12] <+pectusumbra> stabs
[3:58:20] <+Javaa01> Yeah you're probably right
[3:58:20] <+Clievile> you can still do ash moves without FP they just dont work fully BTW
[3:58:20] <%slipdog> no fp= impotent arts
[3:58:21] <FrostedZaibatsu> 1 out of 8
[3:58:22] <%Reveresao> crafting?
[3:58:23] <iacus_> also hard encounter icon btw
[3:58:23] <+theoldone001> They're really slow but there's so fucking many of them so they're dangerous
[3:58:27] <dan_g_v> they seem weak to Torrent just running past them
[3:58:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Galactica cough Phantom
[3:58:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> so slow, basically free Kappa
[3:58:33] <%Double_Tap_That> The spears are glowing so I assume they're magical
[3:58:35] <+Clievile> that ash might actually be good here for dealing with the group
[3:58:50] <%Reveresao> nope
[3:58:50] <%holydeviant1> Very slow, very strong, but those spears are one of the first magic weapons you can get
[3:58:51] <%slipdog> This is a 7/3 matchup you got this
[3:58:52] <HelghastTroop> i wnat woolie to jsut run past these guys and all them slowley walk to him
[3:58:53] <+benbag13> summons woolie
[3:58:59] <warlordpr> crazy, i found this area so much later than woolie, game is huge
[3:58:59] <+pectusumbra> yeah, just dance around them and stab them in the butt seems to be the way
[3:59:00] <HelghastTroop> its like dawn of the dead
[3:59:05] <+anoldtoilet> most enemies dropping their weapons is cool
[3:59:08] <FrostedZaibatsu> The water splashes are pretty cool
[3:59:10] <%Reverend_Roscoe> palanx baby
[3:59:16] <+anoldtoilet> whiffed the meaty
[3:59:22] <dan_g_v> input grab!
[3:59:26] <+MooseIsGoose> They are known as the clay men
[3:59:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> just dangerous enough
[3:59:34] <+pectusumbra> 120 a pop
[3:59:37] <+GilroyGoldBlood> They melt when they die
[3:59:41] <%Reveresao> There is no time limit on the summon, but they are restricted to the summoned area
[3:59:44] <+pupil31> oh boy LUL
[3:59:55] <+anoldtoilet> i think you only get one summon per rest
[3:59:57] <+anoldtoilet> as well
[3:59:58] <%hax_metatron> Think DeS 2-2 miners. Weak to piercing.
[4:00:04] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> kinda remind me of the merlocks from bb
[4:00:06] <+theoldone001> They're literally made of muck I think, that's why I called them mucky boys lol
[4:00:10] <%akajaybay> summon prolly wouldnt be good at avoiding them and they do hit hard
[4:00:15] <+pectusumbra> and they don't have blood either. some kind of milky fluid
[4:00:18] <dan_g_v> well they melted when dead, maybe weak to fire?
[4:00:18] <+Grayhammatter> dang, that's a chonky boi
[4:00:36] <dan_g_v> like, skeleton weak to blunt
[4:00:39] <+pectusumbra> that said you could easily run past these guys if you had to and knew what you were doing
[4:00:41] <user_naim> i‚Äôm getting a lovecraft vibe again. did we walk into bloodborne by accident?
[4:00:46] <+hoenhime344> he hasent found any better magic?
[4:00:50] <%jonblnt> Magic grease?
[4:00:51] <%slipdog> Pthumerian vibes
[4:00:57] <+anoldtoilet> to be fair this is one of the best spells
[4:01:03] <+theoldone001> Woolie is gonna love Raya Lucaria if he's doing a spellsword
[4:01:06] <+anoldtoilet> and the spellcasting trainer is well hidden
[4:01:08] <%radiorosewater> @hoenhime344 he hasn't found the magic teacher yet
[4:01:08] <+hodoumoudou> @hoenhime344 glintblade is better than most other early game spells
[4:01:10] <+hoenhime344> there HAS to be cooler apells though
[4:01:15] <+hoenhime344> ooooo ty
[4:01:36] <+mechslayer71> and there are cooker spells
[4:01:37] <%Double_Tap_That> @hoenhime344 There totally is.
[4:01:39] <+hodoumoudou> a lot of the other spells just do way less damage until you hit midgame
[4:01:42] <+anoldtoilet> @hoenhime344 theres a bunch of cool magic yeah
[4:01:45] <%slipdog> cooker spells BatChest
[4:01:46] <+mechslayer71> MUCH cookler
[4:01:48] <+segmentedfool> The second best spell in the game is glintstone pebble which is the astrologers starting spell
[4:01:50] <+mechslayer71> cooler*
[4:01:52] <Shardlab> @hoenhime344 They exist, they're a bit hard to get to though
[4:01:54] <+anoldtoilet> sorcery has a different sort of vibe in this from darksouls
[4:01:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:01:59] <+pupil31> I bought the other spells but glintblade still rules
[4:02:00] <+tempestzephyr> menacing oboe
[4:02:04] <%akajaybay> I peaced out on this place because it seemed spooky an di was very low level. Should come back and see how it is now.
[4:02:09] <Louie_Salmon> @mechslayer71 Cooking spells, yum
[4:02:13] <%JetpackMcQuack> weak to walking
[4:02:14] <+Javaa01> @hoenhime344 This game has like the highest incentive for speccing into INT out of all the souls games
[4:02:15] <+mechslayer71> @akajaybay same
[4:02:24] <Shardlab> Glintstone pebble/magic missile is the most reliable spell
[4:02:34] <+pupil31> I need to buy Pebble
[4:02:40] <Louie_Salmon> Oh wow I never considered putting summons on that menu. That's smart
[4:02:41] <+segmentedfool> @shardlab yep
[4:02:50] <+pupil31> Teamwork baby
[4:02:51] <+anoldtoilet> glintstone pebble i actually like better than glintstone stars
[4:02:54] <%Double_Tap_That> These bois have the big poise
[4:03:01] <+hodoumoudou> @akajaybay if you've beat the second major boss you can probably handle this area too
[4:03:04] <+anoldtoilet> stars just doesnt do enough damage
[4:03:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> feel outnumberes? :)
[4:03:30] <+segmentedfool> All the other spells have awful fp to damage ratios and bad cast times
[4:03:35] <skagtheprinceofhell> Your wolves still with you
[4:03:36] <skagtheprinceofhell> Damn
[4:03:38] <+segmentedfool> except carian saber
[4:03:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Do this fight 4 more times and you can buy Margit's Shackles
[4:03:44] <%akajaybay> @akajaybay Ah I have not yet. Just passing first.
[4:03:48] <+Graem> ah yes, the pack of ‚Äúlone‚Äù wolves
[4:03:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> until you don't get the refill :)
[4:04:00] <Louie_Salmon> We them bois
[4:04:00] <exnuart> honestly this place is hard
[4:04:01] <+hoenhime344> awe lost a pupper
[4:04:02] <skagtheprinceofhell> Now we the Wild Hunt with the Wolf Pack run alongside you!
[4:04:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> frens
[4:04:06] <+anoldtoilet> @segmentedfool glintstone arc is really good
[4:04:07] <+hodoumoudou> @segmentedfool also: most of the Int weapon arts are way stronger than spells
[4:04:08] <%jonblnt> Wolf pack
[4:04:09] <%Cherokia666> Wolf Pac
[4:04:11] <%radiorosewater> reggy awoo
[4:04:13] <iacus_> the gimmick in this area is really fun though
[4:04:13] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[4:04:14] <pickles4nickles> doggies
[4:04:14] <+pupil31> Diablo style
[4:04:15] <Blank9> three wolves howling at moon shirt
[4:04:16] <zerointelligence000> woof woof crew

[4:06:38] <%akajaybay> thats a lot
[4:06:39] <+pupil31> SQUAD
[4:06:40] <+hoenhime344> at least they are just the swamp people from the Vally of Defilment
[4:06:40] <+Jiggisnipe> @RemedyofRevenge you can

[4:06:55] <%jonblnt> Now Eldin Ring begins
[4:06:59] <%slipdog> this is about his level maybe 5 above
[4:07:02] <%akajaybay> this feels like a smash and grab, run and loot whatever theyll let you get
[4:07:02] <+hoenhime344> Stop with magic!
[4:07:07] <Louie_Salmon> Well no you won't actually
[4:07:10] <user_naim> joestar secret technique
[4:07:12] <%pkthepipes> which chest armor is he wearing?
[4:07:14] <+Vigonept> only one summon per zone right?
[4:07:14] <Shardlab> Arc would have cut them all down
[4:07:16] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus you only get 1 summon per grace sit
[4:07:17] <+pectusumbra> one summon per sit it seems
[4:07:17] <%Deasmeister> One summon per sit
[4:07:23] <Shardlab> @Vigonept uh huh
[4:07:26] <+OniOniOniiii> glinstone arc is od in this area, glad i started sorcerer
[4:07:28] <CappuccinoGuil> 1 summon per sit
[4:07:32] <Kingmm2x> Dub-Ya-Cee Dub-ya Wrestling LUL
[4:07:46] <sendart> being able to spam summons would be so op lol
[4:07:55] <+hoenhime344> i bet the stop with a magic bar will do something
[4:07:57] <+anoldtoilet> yeah once per rest
[4:07:59] <koolkid1208> Just run by them
[4:07:59] <Louie_Salmon> Venetian spellcasting style
[4:08:07] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[4:08:07] <%Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus its once per summon area
[4:08:12] <+Javaa01> Honestly you could probably just grab the item on horseback and leave these guys be
[4:08:16] <+pupil31> LUL
[4:08:16] <KaiserMario> Actin like you won't get command grabbed
[4:08:17] <%Double_Tap_That> LUL

[4:08:28] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @louie_salmon vancian?
[4:08:31] <koolkid1208> Just grab items and run by
[4:08:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> but their grab range is way too far
[4:08:42] <%hax_metatron> Always avoid miners in this game. They‚Äôre tanky. Or use piercing attacks
[4:08:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> they just work so well together
[4:08:44] <+pectusumbra> butt stomp?
[4:08:47] <Shardlab> Craft a grenade?
[4:08:50] <+hoenhime344> the jump attack is really good too
[4:08:54] <kazadaz> Get some guard counters in
[4:08:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:08:58] <OblivionSword1> the estoc might help
[4:09:01] <+pectusumbra> care  for more behind
[4:09:02] <+anoldtoilet> are these guys vulnerable to fire
[4:09:02] <+Jiggisnipe> that's an active hitbox
[4:09:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[4:09:16] <megaman_sentinel> just go for the grab and dash
[4:09:21] <%jonblnt> Don‚Äôt forget about jumping attacks
[4:09:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Why not make some Fire Pots and blow them up?
[4:09:35] <Grunkle_Dan_> i just grabbed the loot and ran, slow guys not worth my time
[4:09:38] <%akajaybay> this is patches true revenge
[4:09:38] <+anoldtoilet> ACTIVE FRAMES
[4:09:40] <+hoenhime344> these guys seem to be the dudes from demons souls valley of defilement it kinda looks like fire will fuck them up
[4:09:49] <CappuccinoGuil> Great time to test Item Crafting, I'd say
[4:09:49] <+anoldtoilet> wtf the disjoint stab

[4:10:29] <%slipdog> he'd have to take his hat off to equip torch too
[4:10:33] <+hoenhime344> Jumping attack is your friend

[4:10:36] <kinkade_77> get outta there

[4:10:40] <%pkthepipes> is that a variant of the tree and beast armor?
[4:10:41] <KaiserMario> @hoenhime344 I feel like most people forget in these games enemies have weaknesses like that and almost never take advantage of them

[4:11:36] <+hoenhime344> but i think this game is MENT for using consumables
[4:11:48] <%Double_Tap_That> I can't believe they actually made the jumping attack good
[4:11:50] <Kingmm2x> Use a steel chair

[4:27:56] <BlackermanZX> that share button is mocking you
[4:27:59] <+pectusumbra> You can do it woolie!
[4:28:03] <%Archmortal> if you have catalyst in left hand and only ever use one weapon in your right, you can put crouch on right d-pad

[4:28:59] <iacus_> yeah I sometimes misclick L3 as well
[4:29:07] <+Javaa01> Gotta just be delicate with it, get that vice grip rehab
[4:29:07] <%radiorosewater> ANYONE WANT LASAGNA?
[4:29:08] <%SirGO0SE> @WoolieVersus check if the bug is back from the hallway before comitting to the jump
[4:29:10] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie will love it
[4:29:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> You can look before doing all this jumping btw
[4:29:15] <rommlll> hey... it's what you're learning
[4:29:15] <+lightbringrrrr> gotta get a controller with backpaddles

[4:29:18] <+aaymon86> Did exiting do anything?
[4:29:18] <@Solidus_113> Woolie just built too different
[4:29:19] <%Double_Tap_That> @Kain5707 Considering you have to hold to run, that sounds awful
[4:29:21] <+RigmaroleHM> Yeah run would maybe even be helpful on L3
[4:29:27] <majindusto> Man Handling  that Controller lol
[4:29:41] <Kain5707> @Kain5707 i mean most games do that
[4:29:45] <%Double_Tap_That> Also muscle memory would probably screw Woolie over if he rebound dodge
[4:29:48] <OblivionSword1> rolling on R3 would be really weird
[4:29:51] <BlackermanZX> ban the liar if it didnt respawn kolMagma

[4:29:53] <Frazbeee> ive spent 15 hours and i dont think i wont be going to margit soon
[4:29:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> shoulda waited on dark souls
[4:29:55] <OblivionSword1> L¬ß
[4:29:55] <+mechslayer71> @kain5707 you have to hold to run, you choose which way to roll with left stick. and rolling by accident is often a death sentence
[4:29:56] <+Jiggisnipe> @Double_Tap_That it's like an fps sprint that way
[4:29:57] <OblivionSword1> L3
[4:30:06] <@Menitta> I now find it weird when L3 isn't sprint toggle

[4:32:01] <penitentpendant> The Backside, always beyond reach...
[4:32:10] <FrostedZaibatsu> Wooww
[4:32:10] <DeathByPoke7> oh
[4:32:13] <Louie_Salmon> Is that how that works?
[4:32:13] <@Solidus_113> yea
[4:32:15] <Blank9> it's super weird but yeah
[4:32:15] <+pectusumbra> Though I imagine instant death falls are still a thing
[4:32:17] <emptyantics> LUL
[4:32:18] <+aaymon86> That makes sense
[4:32:20] <BlackermanZX> oh thats nice
[4:32:22] <ThatChainmecha> i was talking about the magic not the booty
[4:32:23] <@Menitta> so upping endurance decreases fall damage
[4:32:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and now you can go back up, because this ain't a now zone fr fr
[4:32:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> how much stamina do I need to fall off the highest cliff in the game
[4:32:28] <OblivionSword1> and woolieONEGUY  said that the souls community have a bad sense of humor LUL
[4:32:28] <ThatChainmecha> but ill take the booty too
[4:32:30] <linSP> Need arcane for that spell
[4:32:30] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @WoolieVersus I just tried relogging after summoning and it didn't refresh for me
[4:32:30] <%Reveresao> oh i did not know that
[4:32:32] <Oscarthemowerman> i feel like that was maybe the cause of a few of my deaths thinking about it now
[4:32:33] <+Jiggisnipe> that's really cool
[4:32:33] <bamith23> I haven't tackled this area yet, so i'ma peace a bit I guess.
[4:32:33] <Blank9> if you're in combat and are low on stamina and fall off, you'll eat shit on the fall
[4:32:35] <+Javaa01> And if you fall without stamina, you take damage earlier
[4:32:37] <+Fetrigon> luckily his dick can cover the distance LUL
[4:32:41] <MyNameIsRasus> endurance seems like a must have this game
[4:32:41] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus sit to get flasks back
[4:32:43] <+Byr0nX> Oh you in the well? You're not high level enough
[4:32:48] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus that only happens when you're in combat, outside of combat your stamina isn't used
[4:32:49] <+Graem> Reggie‚Äôs little sound effects and cheers give me life. ‚ÄúYee-haw!:
[4:32:51] <HelghastTroop> max endurance can fall from the moon LuL

[4:40:05] <BlackermanZX> help button
[4:40:05] <iacus_> focus = resistance to mind status
[4:40:05] <FrostedZaibatsu> every had a centipede crawl on you. not the best

[4:41:19] <HelghastTroop> the curse of instant death
[4:41:20] <bamith23> Other weird thing I noticed, they brought back how poison ground works from Dark Souls 2. As in it accumulates on your body and stays on you.

[4:41:33] <user_naim> don‚Äôt let your death bar fill up i guess
[4:41:35] <toulon_somberjade> Frostbite when it's filled deals damage and boosts damage taken for awhile. Madness when it fills up will take out your HP AND FP

[4:54:33] <+0neReeler> was that a swipe or a grab
[4:54:40] <%thesw1tch> you can use your magic on the horse and then get off to slow him down
[4:54:42] <+Javaa01> Yeah Reggie is still used to DS1, where attack strings end when you'd think they would
[4:54:46] <%Double_Tap_That> He unga
[4:54:49] <Aussie_Manny> He's SO PISSED that he's dead.
[4:54:51] <+solzan2000> dat backhand

[4:55:04] <Aussie_Manny> Walked right into that one.

[5:16:50] <%Gruhunchously> yeah kill the helpless baby crabs
[5:17:01] <user_naim> That crab is a staple

[5:17:09] <rustybuckethead21> the wall has more itens? or just messages?
[5:17:11] <+Nekros4442> @hoenhime344 yep, they should reuse more assets. Fuck it
[5:17:11] <+scarman125> I still can't believe they just wholesale copied the crabs from DS3
[5:17:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> I know FromSoft loves their giant crabs but this game REALLY loves them
[5:17:27] <ToxInjection> that's how you get the flavour. Get em young VoHiYo
[5:17:27] <total_overkill> @ReallyBigRocks The PRAWNS though
[5:17:29] <neet98> fashion in this game get crazy

[5:18:16] <+cubbywolf> 500 is not alot
[5:18:49] <+vaderxyz1970> Racism by distance.... Distancism
[5:19:02] <@Solidus_113> you can just teleport out to the merchant at any time
[5:19:07] <+hoenhime344> @Nekros4442 normaly i dont like asset reuse, BUT Fromsoft has done an AMAZING job hiding it
[5:19:09] <+cubbywolf> save us wiki
[5:19:11] <iacus_> lvl 1 runes are super plentiful they can be farmed from skulls too

[5:21:00] <emptyantics> @hoenhime344 I second this
[5:21:08] <%Demoli_PT> has woolie seen *that* character in the mistwoods?
[5:21:26] <iacus_> i tried the mistwoods quest but didn't see anything
[5:21:27] <+Vigonept> shut up with those sky spoilers
[5:21:28] <%bruuzer12> chat, should we tell him about the Mistwood bit? since he likes Wolfy so much
[5:21:34] <sonicblade38> what armor set is he wearing?

[5:24:31] <@Solidus_113> Patches gave some real content
[5:24:45] <%akajaybay> the low level smith stones are pretty plentiful
[5:24:48] <BlackermanZX> good ol' trusty Patches
[5:24:59] <kinkade_77> Give margit a couple runs before you buy the item
[5:25:05] <iacus_> once he discovers the place where you can farm smithing stones...
[5:25:21] <+askalta> I literally have an upgraded boss weapon and still can't find smithing stones
[5:25:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> wait did i miss patches?!
[5:25:40] <%Pillagius> You can spare some smithing stones, Woolie. Take it as you wish.
[5:25:40] <%jonblnt> Crafting is anywhere
[5:25:46] <%slipdog> @askalta i went on a special mission outside my level just to unlock them in the shop LUL no regrets.
[5:25:56] <+pectusumbra> so you can straight play consumables
[5:26:00] <+Javaa01> The damage is bad, but they're meant for drawing enemies
[5:26:01] <+Chimeraelite> oh yea them shit's have scaled since DS3 I'm pretty sure
[5:26:03] <%holydeviant1> Thrown shit scales real nice
[5:26:04] <emptyantics> Fire grease is so good
[5:26:05] <iacus_> the bone darts are more useful as a tool than a weapon, but they are pretty versatile
[5:26:06] <%Archmortal> they scale to make them worth crafting and using
[5:26:08] <%slipdog> i like to try all the weapons and upgrade my catalysts and torch and shit
[5:26:10] <+Chimeraelite> made them way more viable
[5:26:11] <CoffeeSlice> bone knives absolute MVPs
[5:26:17] <VJdarkworld> yummy raisins
[5:26:35] <emptyantics> Shout out to my boys, Bone Darts
[5:26:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:26:36] <%slipdog> They're more useful in boss fights that you choose to horse on
[5:26:38] <DuckfishPrime> Goddammit, I absolutely missed the book with fire grease.
[5:26:39] <bobxmaker> i'm lvl 53 and i have no idea where i am going and it's been like that from the start, i'm just wandering finding shit everywhere
[5:26:41] <+Vigonept> isnt that the inky use fir them?
[5:26:43] <%holydeviant1> you also pet torrent when you feed him
[5:26:44] <mikesapartment> yeah the raisins just take precious time
[5:26:46] <+pectusumbra> I mean the stuff is everywhere
[5:26:47] <BlackermanZX> well to be fair a sip can be valuable
[5:26:50] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean, you get a lot of them.
[5:26:51] <iacus_> rowa fruits are literally the most common ingredients in game tho
[5:26:55] <%Archmortal> how many of those rowa berries are you using right now, Woolie
[5:26:55] <+silent__chief> I've literally used it once in 50 hours
[5:26:55] <VJdarkworld> makes more sense for a horsie related boss fight yeh
[5:26:56] <CoffeeSlice> rowa fruits are everywhere...
[5:26:56] <+Javaa01> And sipping on the horse also heals the horse simultaneously
[5:27:00] <+RigmaroleHM> Poor Torrent
[5:27:01] <%akajaybay> those raisins are as common as you can get
[5:27:07] <rasamune> Yeah but also raisins are cheap as fuck
[5:27:11] <%SirGO0SE> thats what it comes down to yeah
[5:27:12] <%Indigo_Automaton> They're really common and easy to craft
[5:27:14] <+dmbender> I used it when doing boses on my mount because when I fell off I was in a very poor spot
[5:27:14] <+Proxzo> Sometimes you get in Horse Fights. you need it for horse fights.
[5:27:14] <%akajaybay> but I never bother with them either
[5:27:15] <+tempestzephyr> feed horse
[5:27:15] <%jonblnt> Except in a outside boss battle
[5:27:17] <%pi_in_the_sci> The consumable will keep the horse alive during horse fights, it's useful
[5:27:17] <%slipdog> you can give them as a treat sometimes :)
[5:27:20] <+theoldone001> You can heal him with raisins which are common items
[5:27:31] <+pectusumbra> the fire grease is probably worth it
[5:27:34] <%slipdog> Bofem
[5:27:34] <%pi_in_the_sci> key first
[5:27:36] <emptyantics> If you sip on the horse it heals him too
[5:27:38] <skagtheprinceofhell> We also need to know if Patches will even talk to you
[5:27:39] <+tempestzephyr> both
[5:27:52] <+silent__chief> @emptyantics wow i didn't know that
[5:27:55] <%SirGO0SE> and I want it now

[5:33:28] <orochiblood> your horse died
[5:33:28] <+DrPoxx> horse didnt die before
[5:33:28] <thaprinnydood> @WoolieVersus only if the horse is killed

[5:33:32] <+froduck42> maybe only combat?
[5:33:33] <Milpool> just fight on foot
[5:33:33] <+anoldtoilet> yes sometimes you can get knocked off the horse and itll disappear
[5:33:34] <geassguy360> Hence the raisins
[5:33:34] <+0neReeler> torrent never died
[5:33:34] <%jinking79> if Horse die it cost one
[5:33:35] <+hoenhime344> torrent died
[5:33:36] <%Archmortal> the horse can be staggered without dying
[5:33:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:33:37] <+anoldtoilet> and sometimes the horse can die
[5:33:37] <+vaderxyz1970> You just fall of your horse
[5:33:37] <penitentpendant> Knocked off
[5:33:40] <%Indigo_Automaton> You lost stamina and got knocked off
[5:33:40] <orochiblood> no

[5:33:41] <+Chimeraelite> You can get knocked off the horse without Torrent dying
[5:33:41] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus Just craft a bunch of raisins
[5:33:43] <+Byr0nX> you killed it
[5:33:43] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus That meant that the horse ran out of health, before this, it's been running out of Poise
[5:33:43] <%MajorCrasher> no, you only got knocked off
[5:33:43] <+SmartAssPawn089> Knocked off doesn't always mean dead
[5:33:44] <+vaderxyz1970> No
[5:33:45] <+AyupaPupa> those were just getting knocked off
[5:33:45] <+pectusumbra> If you fall off he just winks out
[5:33:45] <+lightbringrrrr> no you've only been knocked off
[5:33:45] <genmypoweralready> Nah that isn't death
[5:33:46] <%slipdog> You can get Dismounted without him dying, by reaching poise break WoolieVersus
[5:33:46] <orochiblood> The horse has poise.
[5:33:46] <+aaymon86> No, you got knocked off
[5:33:47] <BlackermanZX> no they knocked you off
[5:33:49] <+Paronoma> because you were in a fight i think
[5:33:49] <SideChar> your horse died
[5:33:49] <genmypoweralready> He has his own health
[5:33:50] <Puhff> Nope
[5:33:55] <mikesapartment> its only during a boss fight that it makes you use a flask
[5:33:55] <+dandywaffles> First time horse died
[5:33:57] <linSP> to those who beat this guy on base level, go off (I did it too)
[5:33:58] <+AyupaPupa> dex lets you stay on your horse longer
[5:33:58] <+snarkilly1111> he will neigh when he dies
[5:33:59] <user_naim> Naah he just peaced out
[5:34:01] <%SirGO0SE> yeah he has a health bar that pops up
[5:34:05] <genmypoweralready> THE BOYS

[5:34:10] <%whyskeywolfe> This game is an INVESTMENT
[5:34:14] <+pupil31> NOBLE SQUAD
[5:34:18] <SunsetJack> I am kinda sure Torrent's HP doesn't get back up...
[5:34:20] <karawra> go nobles go
[5:34:21] <%RunawayOcean> maybe being in a boss fight triggers that
[5:34:22] <%thesw1tch> more magic!
[5:34:22] <+dandywaffles> Torrent will neigh when they die

[5:34:41] <+HelloImTom08> i feel like this fight is way easier on foot
[5:34:42] <orochiblood> This fight is easier if the framerate doesnt shit itself
[5:34:43] <+tempestzephyr> no i frames on the horse
[5:34:43] <DuckfishPrime> The squad does surprising work
[5:34:44] <+cubbywolf> I can't believe I spent 2 hours fighting this boss
[5:34:46] <+Vigonept> NAH HE CAN DO IT
[5:34:46] <+Walopoh> X
[5:34:48] <%akajaybay> the nobles are good at annoying the shit out of him until he does some butt stomping
[5:34:49] <koolkid1208> try dodging that attack ;)
[5:34:50] <gespenstkick> Just noticed that's grass on his helmet
[5:34:56] <user_naim> Doable
[5:35:01] <%SirGO0SE> ok now this time for real B)
[5:35:01] <+pectusumbra> It feels like just magic is the way for real. stay away from that spear
[5:35:06] <+vaderxyz1970> He's very Anti Magic
[5:35:07] <+0neReeler> where ma dawgs at
[5:35:12] <+RowenCleric> jellyfish gang for life
[5:35:12] <+hoenhime344> ouch
[5:35:14] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[5:35:15] <DanteReaver> He is weaker than Daigo, Woolie. Just out footsy him!
[5:35:16] <%slipdog> Praise (o) The (o) Tree (o)
[5:35:16] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[5:35:22] <+hoenhime344> that hit always looks like it HURTS
[5:35:24] <Blank9> he's easier with an unupgraded longsword than magic
[5:35:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Play like your fencing
[5:35:34] <%akajaybay> Dodge while mounted gives you a speed burst
[5:35:38] <+SmartAssPawn089> True combos are real, yes
[5:35:44] <%SirGO0SE> he spinning PogChamp
[5:35:45] <iacus_> could hide at the churs i guess
[5:35:47] <iacus_> chirch
[5:35:47] <BlackermanZX> this aint a great zone to fight him
[5:35:49] <slix3431> So no maidens?
[5:35:49] <iacus_> agh
[5:35:51] <+pectusumbra> go kill bloodhound instead?
[5:35:51] <+Vigonept> torrent died when he neighs loudly
[5:35:53] <+mechslayer71> he's easier on foot fight honestly tbh
[5:35:53] <+Walopoh> it's so funny this guy is like the first enemy new players walk up to fight LUL
[5:35:54] <+cubbywolf> we gunna be here for a day
[5:35:56] <+tempestzephyr> the horse is not helping
[5:36:02] <plankk56> whats their characters lvl?
[5:36:07] <Milpool> easier on foot for sure
[5:36:07] <+vaderxyz1970> "Tree Sentinal"
[5:36:09] <total_overkill> Not just the trees... that church can be smashed
[5:36:13] <%SirGO0SE> has woolie tried using the church for cover? Kappa
[5:36:14] <kinkade_77> This guys though
[5:36:14] <DanteReaver> I beat him at lvl 111
[5:36:18] <DanteReaver> 11*
[5:36:18] <Blank9> he's way easier on horse just hugging his ass circling
[5:36:19] <%Reveresao> I find fighting guys on horses easier on the ground
[5:36:22] <VJdarkworld> i had to lure the guy up to the church to get away from the lag zone he starts in
[5:36:22] <%RyTYoung> That was weird me and Woolie just whistled in torrent in sync doodBait doodBait doodBait
[5:36:29] <+eanscrale> I feel like this guy is here to teach new players, running away is an option.
[5:36:32] <linSP> I cheesed this guy with a large club on the horse, easiest way to do it before magic
[5:36:45] <Aussie_Manny> khadKEK khadKEK khadKEK
[5:36:49] <+Walopoh> @eanscrale running away is the ONLY option LUL
[5:36:52] <%livlinn> oooh Woolworth has doggies PrideRise
[5:36:52] <+Vigonept> i used a spear and horse
[5:36:55] <BlackermanZX> fighting him on this space is terrible
[5:36:58] <%MajorCrasher> I feel like using the horse just makes this guy harder
[5:37:03] <iacus_> is it possible to dismount this guy?
[5:37:10] <%livlinn> miasNLT
[5:37:11] <+HelloImTom08> dont think so
[5:37:11] <%MajorCrasher> unless you're going to lure him to a flat plain
[5:37:14] <%thesw1tch> i would summon more while hes busy
[5:37:16] <%thesw1tch> welp
[5:37:17] <total_overkill> @iacus_ No
[5:37:21] <+Vigonept> nah ya cant take him off
[5:37:27] <%RyTYoung> I ganked this dude with the uchi on horseback, dealt with some stuff then came back I didn‚Äôt want to make the boss harder than it had to be
[5:37:28] <Clyderso> you only get 1 summon
[5:37:31] <%akajaybay> you just get the one summon
[5:37:32] <VJdarkworld> theres two gamers in the world. ones that just walk past this boss, and others that fight it right after they leave the tutorial
[5:37:33] <+eanscrale> @Walopoh well some of them quit and then post on the internet about it, so not a great alternative but at least it's funny.
[5:37:36] <DanteReaver> You can kite him with horse
[5:37:42] <iacus_> you need the consistency of r1
[5:37:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, just in and out
[5:37:50] <DanteReaver> which makes it so you dont have to dodge attacks
[5:37:55] <total_overkill> Dismount saved torrent there
[5:37:55] <BlackermanZX> you have to lure him to a flat place
[5:38:01] <+hoenhime344> why can his horse pivot like a ballet dancer and torrent cant?
[5:38:08] <penitentpendant> @MajorCrasher It mostly depends on how you fight him. If you use joust hit and run tactics, most of his wind ups at range have dodgeable telegraph
[5:38:08] <+Vigonept> why you so stylish
[5:38:16] <bleugh> tech
[5:38:18] <%slipdog> now is when you want the raisins

[5:48:39] <%slipdog> @VJdarkworld bruh i first tried G
[5:48:41] <user_naim> @drunken_lemur i think he said Inertia Drift
[5:48:43] <plankk56> dood was making his horse tackle
[5:48:50] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> why do so many weapons scale with faith?
[5:48:55] <+Fetrigon> that guy for sure coming back as a regular enemy. Probably gonna be two and one of them has a greatbowor some shit. LUL
[5:49:04] <linSP> I made a faith guy to carry this thing at low level
[5:49:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Gold pressed latinum
[5:49:09] <%slipdog> Faith is magic to do with the Erdtree, no? makes sense it would be prevalent
[5:49:12] <Shardlab> Damn
[5:49:15] <Hydrapissed> pretty solid weapon art there
[5:49:15] <Plughead_> you can twohand it
[5:49:17] <CoffeeSlice> paladin
[5:49:20] <xXFlyingBrickXx> Now that's a paladin weapon
[5:49:29] <%radiorosewater> phrasing
[5:49:37] <%Namillus> There's lots of things to have Faith in here in the Lands Between.
[5:49:41] <FrostedZaibatsu> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends You have to believe my brother eevisuP eevisuP2 eevisuP3
[5:49:44] <%ItalianWaifu> i was disapointed the falling rocks dont hurt hm
[5:49:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[5:49:49] <%SirGO0SE> I don't know if he can kill the NPC and also don't want to test it LUL
[5:49:51] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[5:50:02] <%RyTYoung> That was a wholesome chuckle
[5:50:17] <Shardlab> Friends are few enough in the Lands Between without getting them killed
[5:50:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> The charge attacks are pretty cool too
[5:50:26] <%slipdog> WoolieVersus the weapon art buffs your Wolves too!
[5:50:30] <+eanscrale> yeah this moveset has been there since the beginning.
[5:50:36] <+pectusumbra> Could two hand it at 20 strength if you wanted?
[5:50:41] <Hydrapissed> its just slower overall
[5:50:43] <%Namillus> Yeah stagger on whiff is gone as far as I know
[5:50:44] <+pectusumbra> then you'd just need the 12 faith
[5:50:45] <Hydrapissed> but has a nice moveset
[5:50:46] <+anoldtoilet> you need faith for it and woolie is anti faith
[5:50:47] <%GrandpaJaji> Ive been rocking it, its a great weapon so far. And yeah, no stagger in this game makes it a plus
[5:50:50] <+anoldtoilet> he has literally 6 faith
[5:50:52] <+pectusumbra> that's 7 levels in total at this point
[5:50:52] <iacus_> Elden Ring recycling animations 0/10 game
[5:50:54] <+zepherl> the weapon art is fantastic
[5:50:55] <Hydrapissed> need 12 faith
[5:50:57] <%„Çª„Éì„Éº> halberds havent staggered since ds1
[5:50:58] <+pectusumbra> isn't it 9 faith?
[5:51:04] <+pectusumbra> I mean is he at 9 right now
[5:51:05] <+0neReeler> halberd on the horse
[5:51:15] <+zepherl> even if you dont use it, using the weapon art and unequipping lets you keep your buffs
[5:51:17] <%pi_in_the_sci> The lucerne is far away
[5:51:17] <jorniev> TRY IT ON HORSEBACK
[5:51:18] <+pectusumbra> ahhh, 6. so it'd be 10 levels then
[5:51:23] <%radiorosewater> lucerne exists in the z axis
[5:51:26] <%akajaybay> horse?
[5:51:38] <+pectusumbra> 6 levels of faith, 4 levels strength, then 2 hand is possible.
[5:51:42] <robert_orri> horse moveset?
[5:51:43] <%Xelhesia> run maybe?
[5:51:48] <+0neReeler> horse
[5:51:50] <+vaderxyz1970> Chip where did you get that hand grenade? I don't know.....

[5:56:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> @dan_g_v they call it that cuz you go "well...."
[5:56:38] <+Javaa01> And you haven't even seen the *best* chest

[5:56:54] <%AngryAsian5> LUL
[5:56:54] <emptyantics> LUL
[5:56:54] <dan_g_v> @ReallyBigRocks good one
[5:56:55] <Shwepie> There is no peeping in a true open world game.
[5:56:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is OCD: the game
[5:57:01] <%AngryAsian5> "Yo, what's that." The Game
[5:57:01] <+Jiggisnipe> have these people never played an open world game?
[5:57:01] <iacus_> you're playing the game as intended tbh
[5:57:03] <AnthroMetal> just let the journey happen chat
[5:57:04] <%Cherokia666> It took me 4 days to get around to the castle
[5:57:13] <+0neReeler> oh shiny
[5:57:17] <+hdoomzpa> been playing 13 hours still haven't gone to the castle
[5:57:21] <iacus_> rushing it to the main quest would be a worse experience, for sure
[5:57:37] <AnthroMetal> I think i spent like 35 hours pre-castle just doing everything
[5:57:37] <+eanscrale> "it keeps happening"
[5:57:40] <koolkid1208> I spent 20hrs before going to the castle
[5:57:44] <user_naim> talk about value
[5:57:48] <%AngryAsian5> Brakes? What the fuck are those?
[5:57:48] <Shwepie> Rushing seems to cause people a lot of problems.
[5:57:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> I was almost level 30 before I took a real shot at the castle
[5:57:52] <@Solidus_113> you have to accept in your heart
[5:57:56] <DuckfishPrime> Question: when he says Patches, does he actually mean Patches?
[5:57:59] <orochiblood> they definitely didnt fake it lmao
[5:58:01] <emptyantics> 3 days before I even touched the castle
[5:58:02] <%Cherokia666> Fromsoft went HARD
[5:58:09] <%Xelhesia> like Xenoblade
[5:58:12] <%GrandpaJaji> I can foresee a disclaimer on the anime for this, telling people to chill if Woolie doesnt find their favorite thing cuz man, this game is just so big
[5:58:13] <+Jiggisnipe> this is legit open world
[5:58:19] <linSP> I‚Äôm looking at the steam achievos, only 56% have found the hub
[5:58:24] <aka_Jigawatt> 3=D
[5:58:25] <FrostedZaibatsu> IT HAS BOTH
[5:58:27] <+Jiggisnipe> @Xelhesia good example
[5:58:34] <iacus_> might be the best fantasy open world put to videogame. and I've only seen a fraction of it yet
[5:58:37] <dan_g_v> a 10 year old plan
[5:58:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis Game NotLikeThis Big NotLikeThis
[5:58:40] <souptrader> fr. been using a notebook to keep track of things in this game. great writing practice too as if try to write in my character‚Äôs voice
[5:58:40] <+SmartAssPawn089> Stupidly big open world, and it's dense
[5:58:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Now think about what this game will look like in 7 years with the DLC and mods.
[5:58:54] <user_naim> @souptrader that‚Äôs such a good idea
[5:59:03] <Shardlab> We barely know everything about the starting zone
[5:59:05] <FrostedZaibatsu> Open world and large locations that serve as regular Dark Souls zones
[5:59:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> they're out there
[5:59:08] <DanteReaver> REALLY?
[5:59:10] <total_overkill> @linSP Hubs pretty hard to get too though
[5:59:11] <reonome> illusory FLOORS
[5:59:12] <Louie_Salmon> Tens of hours in
[5:59:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> good luck
[5:59:13] <+HelloImTom08> im currently doing like a long ass NPC like skyrim questline, is crazy
[5:59:15] <Aussie_Manny> Fuckin' illusory walls...

[5:59:16] <SupidaMan> and floors
[5:59:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> ! F R E N Z Y !
[5:59:20] <+0neReeler> of course

[5:59:24] <BlackermanZX> AND THEN THERES FLOORS
[5:59:25] <dan_g_v> you missed all the illusory walls?!
[5:59:25] <emptyantics> The second zone is fucking nuts and so is the Red Zone
[5:59:25] <%whyskeywolfe> I just found one today after 60 hours.
[5:59:26] <+HelloImTom08> WTF???
[5:59:27] <Aussie_Manny> Blade: "...They exist."
[5:59:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL Reggie

[5:59:28] <+HelloImTom08> the floors
[5:59:28] <AnthroMetal> yup
[5:59:29] <+hoenhime344> ....
[5:59:29] <%SirGO0SE> there are SO many walls that could be hidden NotLikeThis
[5:59:29] <Shardlab> WHAT?
[5:59:31] <Shardlab> No
[5:59:33] <Aussie_Manny> ILLUSORY FLOORS?!?
[5:59:34] <total_overkill> Ceilings too
[5:59:34] <%Cherokia666> the look of fear
[5:59:35] <+ultran122> it's all cake
[5:59:37] <Aussie_Manny> AHH FUCK
[5:59:38] <+Javaa01> There are also illusory towers
[5:59:38] <%pungotcha> pardon???
[5:59:38] <+pupil31> True bestie
[5:59:39] <Shardlab> Nope. Nope. Nope....
[5:59:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Reggie takes damage
[5:59:41] <iacus_> I didn't know that
[5:59:43] <+eanscrale> I told you about floors bro
[5:59:43] <FrostedZaibatsu> Illusory NPCs?
[5:59:43] <minusworldz> Illusory floors too?
[5:59:45] <Louie_Salmon> Next up, Illusory SKY
[5:59:46] <user_naim> Christ
[5:59:46] <emptyantics> ILLUSORY FLOORS
[5:59:47] <styptysat> LUL
[5:59:49] <linSP> Here‚Äôs your illusory boss
[5:59:50] <%jinking79> look at the damage Reggie took
[5:59:51] <Shardlab> Psychic damage
[5:59:52] <+Javaa01> @FrostedZaibatsu Yeah that's in there too
[5:59:53] <user_naim> I‚Äôm taking damage
[5:59:56] <+Drigoooooo> they are easy to tell but so easy to miss if you are not looking hard enough
[6:00:01] <AnthroMetal> @FrostedZaibatsu does it count if they're projections?
[6:00:02] <souptrader> illusory skybox
[6:00:03] <user_naim> I haven‚Äôt fucking found any
[6:00:03] <+hoenhime344> you have to just be an adventurer.... you aint gonna be a gamer
[6:00:04] <iacus_> I would have liked to find those floors by myself... oh well
[6:00:04] <+pupil31> Reggie getting that insight
[6:00:07] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Mind goblins felled
[6:00:07] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus There is an npc that is just a bush that you got to find
[6:00:08] <DuckfishPrime> Alright, I'm giving up on finding secrets.  This is the information to break that habit.
[6:00:09] <+eanscrale> well bloodborne already had an illusory sky so
[6:00:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> Also regular destructible walls exist
[6:00:09] <SupidaMan> they sbow up later game
[6:00:09] <Louie_Salmon> Illusory game, the entirety of Elden Ring just fades away.
[6:00:11] <+FadingEmber> did he get him?
[6:00:12] <%Namillus> Are we counting collapsing floors as illusory here
[6:00:12] <%GrandpaJaji> Sooo minecraft?
[6:00:13] <reonome> LUL
[6:00:15] <user_naim> Oh god help me
[6:00:15] <%SirGO0SE> illusory toilets, you wont know until its too late NotLikeThis

[6:00:18] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[6:00:18] <+Javaa01> @souptrader I mean yeah that's the entire underground
[6:00:22] <+askalta> is the stream over
[6:00:24] <%Xelhesia> thankfully no more durability
[6:00:28] <total_overkill> @Namillus No, straight up illusion
[6:00:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> my brain has melted because of this game
[6:00:31] <%pungotcha> yknow seeing this game, i'm very curious as to what BOTW2 will be like...
[6:00:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> @FrostedZaibatsu That was suppose to be a joke
[6:00:51] <%Archmortal> the solution is to stop fighting it and let it wash over and crush your brain with the pressure of an ocean
[6:00:55] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Rolling into illusory walls also works, so no need to bonk absolutely everything
[6:00:57] <emptyantics> Don‚Äôt forget destructable things that can only be broken by giant enemies :)
[6:00:58] <Ragnorok64> Has he talked about the Artesian Builds situation?
[6:01:00] <FrostedZaibatsu> 2 MAPS
[6:01:07] <%raggedwharfrat> raggedwharfrat subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:01:15] <%livlinn> this is BotW for grownups
[6:01:21] <AnthroMetal> I keep getting astounded by the vistas in this game
[6:01:23] <KingDrPimp> I'm like 40 something hours in and haven't found a hidden wall so far  FeelsBadMan
[6:01:30] <+Akizea> you cant
[6:01:31] <+Arnoldoaad1> Chaos??!
[6:01:33] <+SmartAssPawn089> There is no controlling this, 30 hrs in.
[6:01:36] <koolkid1208> you can't
[6:01:37] <+benbag13> @woolieversus have you tried play this cool platformer 'Thomas was Alone'?
[6:01:49] <%raggedwharfrat> I just found AN ILLUSORY ROCK
[6:01:53] <AnthroMetal> @KingDrPimp I was at 55 hours today and finally found a bunch
[6:01:54] <+HelloImTom08> you need a Elden Ring Journal lol
[6:01:56] <@Solidus_113> that's fine
[6:01:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:01:58] <perfect_disaster> to quote obama LUL LUL
[6:02:04] <jvilly96> 60-70 hours in and still finding shit
[6:02:07] <bleugh> obama the hedgehog
[6:02:13] <+theoldone001> I hated the loot system in BoTW. Specially since weapons were just consumables.
[6:02:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> the "come back later"-ness is my favorite aspect of this game
[6:02:20] <%SirGO0SE> @raggedwharfrat oh come on
[6:02:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah nah that's for LATER
[6:02:29] <@Solidus_113> that moose is mid-game shit
[6:02:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> you walk in a door and the game goes "you sure?"
[6:02:32] <%Cherokia666> There's basically "too much," and that's a good thing
[6:02:34] <total_overkill> @raggedwharfrat its true
[6:02:41] <Shardlab> I shot that bear with a pebble and it did less than the wolves surrounding it. No thank you. Dire Bears are You Died
[6:02:56] <koolkid1208> @WoolieVersus You are gonna want a journal 100 markers aren't enough
[6:03:28] <+Arnoldoaad1> I actually beat the boss in the basement really early on and got excited after seeing 0.38% on the achievement on day 1
[6:03:36] <%nicversus> nicversus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 13 months let's gooo! Wondering if you're keeping up with the Capcom TOS for SFV Tournament Organizer debacle; it looks like they're backpedaling a bit due to the backlash
[6:03:49] <+Javaa01> Good luck with that approach
[6:04:03] <emptyantics> @nicversus Fucking Capcom
[6:04:23] <%Namillus> GRRM was likely influential in filling out the message terms
[6:04:24] <%jonblnt> LUL
[6:04:25] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i came in with the GRRM didnt touch this much impression but his finger prints are definitely here
[6:04:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> the two are pretty close tbh, it's a good pairing
[6:04:28] <iacus_> the GRRM flavor is pretty strong tbh. Maybe I wasn't expecting much but it's there in spades
[6:04:36] <+Arnoldoaad1> you can definitely feel him as well as Miyazaki

[6:04:52] <+Drigoooooo> yeah a lot of the lore has GRRM all over it
[6:05:10] <%SirGO0SE> this game is the GRRM redemption arc
[6:05:20] <+zepherl> quest logs are nice for if you come back to the game after taking a break
[6:05:22] <Louie_Salmon> Oh boy
[6:05:23] <dan_g_v> time to write it down
[6:05:23] <+Jiggisnipe> create your own quest log
[6:05:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think that's expected of you
[6:05:25] <%specters_art88> There aren‚Äôt that many quests either.
[6:05:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @arnoldoaad1 which basement?
[6:05:27] <%jonblnt> @woolieversus if you run past all the enemies and light the torches you‚Äôll get a good rewards. Doable at your level
[6:05:32] <+Javaa01> Get that notepad ready on your phone
[6:05:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> I've already forgotten like 3 NPC things LUL
[6:05:34] <orochiblood> the whole part about the Night of Black Knives killing Godwyn was very GRRM
[6:05:36] <Shwepie> Bust out the Notepad!
[6:05:41] <+Jiggisnipe> Souls games didn't need quest logs
[6:05:46] <nintega010> Would you like to see that overwhelming quest log
[6:05:48] <%MajorCrasher> honestly I feel like icons and quest logs should be optional in every game that is huge. I get a lot of people hate them but I much prefer them to, just find everything on your own dipshit
[6:05:50] <+SmartAssPawn089> Use the map markers, there's too much shit
[6:05:50] <total_overkill> @zepherl One does not leave Elden Ring... let alone return
[6:05:51] <linSP> Use the npc markers!
[6:05:51] <rasamune> Either write it down or just let yourself forget
[6:05:57] <@Solidus_113> A good way to do it is "see an NPC? do their quest now"
[6:05:58] <Zoxjib> ive played 70 hours and only did limgrave and east+west+north Liurnia. now idea how people beat the game in 30-40 hours. they probably skill like 80% of the game
[6:06:06] <iacus_> it would be a chore to orient yourself with no map here
[6:06:07] <FrostedZaibatsu> If this game didnt have a map... Jesus
[6:06:14] <Aussie_Manny> ooohhh elden ring
[6:06:16] <Shardlab> Oh, Elden Ring... It burns!
[6:06:18] <+Jiggisnipe> ignore that
[6:06:18] <SainEdge> Jerma has a notepad open, not a bad idea LUL
[6:06:19] <+mechslayer71> ok
[6:06:19] <Louie_Salmon> Chat
[6:06:24] <%kewlmyc> Just ignore that. Fucking chat
[6:06:25] <%Shad0wTag> what

[6:06:32] <%DreamCancel01> tight
[6:06:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[6:06:58] <+Jiggisnipe> @SainEdge Reggie is writing down notes
[6:07:04] <+pectusumbra> Not to mention this game is literally fucking HUGE
[6:07:04] <iacus_> ah gotcha
[6:07:16] <%SirGO0SE> yeah viewership was crazy high today, 2x sajam and pat at one point
[6:07:21] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie that is a cop out
[6:07:26] <Shardlab> "lurkmoar"
[6:07:34] <emptyantics> This is one of the biggest games ever, you won‚Äôt get to everything
[6:07:36] <+Jiggisnipe> Sajam repeatedly tells people not to backseat or spoil him
[6:07:37] <mikesapartment> i dont think that's normal behavior at all
[6:07:43] <BlackermanZX> and thats why mods are loaded with guns kolFARMERS
[6:07:45] <@Solidus_113> just stop. get some help.
[6:07:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta learn to be at least as vague as the game if you're gonna try that
[6:07:51] <+tempestzephyr> touch grace chat
[6:07:52] <total_overkill> Stop leaving items in waterfalls and we'll stop '=p
[6:07:52] <truegreed> Enjoy the show, not explain the plot
[6:08:07] <+TeeSeeDubs> no maidens?
[6:08:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> one guy
[6:08:23] <BreakfastSampler> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ it's definitely way more than one lol
[6:08:27] <rasamune> Do not explaaaain the plot / If you don‚Äôt understand, you should not be here
[6:08:34] <Aussie_Manny> Such is the life of a content creator. Now it's just LIVE!
[6:08:35] <koolkid1208> Souls = Back seating
[6:08:37] <perfect_disaster> woolie knows
[6:08:38] <%SirGO0SE> its a little better when chats backseating route is at least kept to the level of detail as in game messages
[6:08:41] <slix3431> ! Toxic Fanbase !
[6:08:42] <AnthroMetal> With what From has accomplished with Elden Ring, how do you think they apply everything they've done to an Armored Core game?
[6:08:53] <emptyantics> Too many ONE GUYS in the Fromsoft games
[6:09:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ they are all one guy, the omni guy

[6:09:33] <+robertoszek> great session btw

[6:11:26] <+Drigoooooo> A win is a win
[6:11:33] <@Solidus_113> a dub is a dub
[6:11:33] <%Ariosen> cheese as hard as possible
[6:11:39] <+0neReeler> fists only no armor
[6:11:39] <koolkid1208> Its in the game its fair game
[6:11:39] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[6:11:42] <%Irridium> bosses will cheese the shit out of you fuck 'em
[6:11:44] <+mechslayer71> there's cool melee magic
[6:11:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> if they don't want you to summon shit they just don't let you
[6:11:45] <rasamune> Just win the game
[6:11:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is the most cheeseable game they made and it's 100% okay
[6:11:48] <iacus_> magic is so cool in this time
[6:11:49] <nintega010> they've honestly balanced it around
[6:11:49] <truegreed> A stock is a stock
[6:11:50] <+Drigoooooo> Fromsoft bosses will cheese you
[6:11:57] <+Jiggisnipe> those mechanics don't exist to not be used
[6:11:57] <perfect_disaster> just use what you have
[6:12:00] <+0neReeler> ! AEGIS !
[6:12:01] <KR_Black> Unless you get stuck in a piece of the arena the boss cant reach , its not cheese , its a strategy
[6:12:11] <xdeathknightx> Woolie got into souls games due to playing with Pat, if anyone tells you to cheese enemies it is Pat :D
[6:12:11] <koolkid1208> They put it in the game for you to use them if you want
[6:12:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> No, its hard with magic AND summons
[6:12:24] <+HelloImTom08> I killed a boss today with arrows and running around a pillar LUL
[6:13:05] <+theoldone001> I only summon when bosses have adds. One on One I dont
[6:13:07] <+robertoszek> @HelloImTom08 the Tarnished Hero we need
[6:13:10] <@Solidus_113> there are times where magic just doesn't cut it, and you need to run it and just fight
[6:13:19] <rasamune> ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù means ‚Äúlearn to win‚Äù not ‚Äúmake things hard for yourself on purpose‚Äù
[6:13:29] <emptyantics> I‚Äôm playing with a debuff because it gives you good benefits and it teaches you to get gud
[6:13:32] <%SirGO0SE> i think it is tbh
[6:13:35] <Louie_Salmon> You still have to plan when you're casting, if you spam they will instantly close the distance and punish
[6:13:44] <%SirGO0SE> tree sentinel made that clear LUL
[6:13:46] <%kewlmyc> Well, there's melee magic attacks as well
[6:13:50] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[6:13:55] <+HelloImTom08> yea some bosses are way toofast to even use magic and the game compensate with melee spells too
[6:13:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ideally a moonlight GS
[6:14:00] <kazadaz> Yeah I'll use fireballs if something looks weak to fire, but otherwise it's cold steel
[6:14:05] <+Javaa01> Also the coolest shit primarily exists in the magic and miracles this time around, and pumping INT ends up scaling most cool swords
[6:14:08] <+mechslayer71> bow and arrow does no damage tho
[6:14:12] <warlordpr> most elden ring bosses just dodge the magic, I can attest to that as a magic wielder
[6:14:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'm going Jack of all Trades... I know I'm gonna regret it LUL
