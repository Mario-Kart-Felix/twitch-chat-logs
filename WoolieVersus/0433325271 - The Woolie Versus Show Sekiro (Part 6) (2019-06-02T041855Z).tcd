[0:26:41] <$Retrash> Yeah I guess they didn't tell that to Stannis LUL
[0:26:43] <RyuuAoi> RULES?? WOOLIE VS?? Hahahaha
[0:26:48] <samuraijakanddaxter> cut off point is season 1 episode 1 now, because i cant watch all that shit again knowing the white walker arc was pointless
[0:26:49] <masterjayshay> Characters that survive because they "died" off screen? Sounds like Vergil to me.
[0:26:54] <Dragon_Batman> oof
[0:27:04] <chicken_brotherr> yeah but Vergil is cool
[0:27:06] <@Solidus_113> how about that time Dio had laser eyes and ice powers? apatSmug
[0:27:12] <Jontman42> @WoolieVersus My toleration went with Arya surviving three deep stabs to the gut and falling to an open sewer right after.
[0:27:15] <Prevot> introducing abilities and never using them again, the Araki way
[0:27:17] <%GinAndRoses> remember when GoT was good, fellow old people?
[0:27:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "Mouse for what" LUL
[0:27:22] <KeiPrime> fuck, space ripper stingy eyes
[0:27:28] <+Zayasu> same
[0:27:28] <KeiPrime> up there with STAR FINGER
[0:27:28] <masterjayshay> yeah Vergil IS cool. That's why he lives even after 5 XD
[0:27:29] <%Aussie_Manny> The stab.
[0:27:37] <Jetsfantasy> @Solidus_113 At least Straizo remembered about it
[0:27:38] <samuraijakanddaxter> arya juked him
[0:27:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @masterjayshay Plot twist. Everyone is actually Vergil in GOT
[0:27:47] <MillaMoks> @WoolieVersus A "cube" would solve your mouse falling problem Kappa
[0:27:52] <samuraijakanddaxter> night king was a bald fraud
[0:27:53] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus did you or minh watched john wick 3?
[0:28:01] <RyuuAoi> Wooli TRIED, Y'all
[0:28:08] <ligerglare> GoT doodStare
[0:28:12] <chicken_brotherr> tbf if you had ZA WARUDO at your disposal, why would you ever use dumpy ass vampire powers
[0:28:23] <gigacanuck> are we just starting?
[0:28:24] <KeiPrime> why not do both man
[0:28:27] <+MrProw> dio could have used both
[0:28:40] <+Double_Tap_That> They ate a raw super
[0:28:48] <RyuuAoi> Imagine if Endgame was shit...
[0:28:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Critical Hit IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE
[0:28:54] <chicken_brotherr> he could have used both, but who cares about those powers
[0:29:01] <%conflict1914> Game of Thrones got wall bounced near season 5 and it was all downhill from there
[0:29:02] <Jetsfantasy> @chicken_brotherr You could do sick setups with Timestop and using 9 seconds to prep stingy eyes since you could at least shoot it. Basically eye lasers
[0:29:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> They hated her because she told the truth

[0:29:39] <samuraijakanddaxter> i thought the show dropped massively from season 5, but i was totally willing to give it a shot this season, and they dropped the ball lol
[0:29:45] <Dragon_Batman> Yea how could you say those things just for thie clicks Woolz
[0:29:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:29:46] <RyuuAoi> Because if you have an opinion, fuck you. You don't think like me? Fuck you.
[0:29:57] <@Solidus_113> Eyes of Heaven literally has a combo super with Part 1 and Part 3 where he uses his laser eyes during timestop
[0:29:59] <Dragon_Batman> LUL ooo that was funny to see
[0:29:59] <%galaxyswirl> apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat
[0:29:59] <RyuuAoi> You have to like what I like. And only what I like.
[0:30:01] <Futurecity10> Fuck people who like bad things. You're allowed to like bad thing but only if you know its bad
[0:30:14] <KeiPrime> but eyes of heaven tho
[0:30:15] <lemon_lore> time to go back to west world
[0:30:24] <jimmytwofeet> Let's all just calm down and have some Cheerios
[0:30:26] <Chester_goes_Berserk> The garbage just built up to garbage in the end. Actors were amazing tho
[0:30:26] <@Solidus_113> it's all about fan service
[0:30:27] <%FeelinNifty> Game of Thrones turning out the way it did is at least making me look forward to the Dune and Wheel of Time adaptations. Those are also probably going to be not great, but the novelty will be nice.
[0:30:39] <samuraijakanddaxter> GRRM says the netflix medieval fiction show the last kingdom is really good, i might have to get into that now
[0:30:41] <Jetsfantasy> Guess I gotta get Eyes of Heaven now
[0:30:42] <alexandrecau> when it comes to polish dnd were great, but then they want to steer too much
[0:30:46] <KeiPrime> you really dont
[0:30:51] <+gogo_gadgette> where are we in sekiro?
[0:30:55] <$FuqBoiSlim> just watch the let's play
[0:30:58] <Jontman42> I don't think you can reduce it to "oh their writing was just shit all along"
[0:31:03] <masterjayshay> The plot twist is that Pat is an Orangutan.
[0:31:03] <AmericanaRed> ???
[0:31:14] <b_fran> hell yeah
[0:31:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:31:16] <KeiPrime> gotta play 3rd birthday first

[0:31:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYE apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:31:20] <KeiPrime> nice work minh on that one
[0:31:20] <GundamF91> PogChamp
[0:31:20] <chicken_brotherr> tbh, you could justify DIO not using vamp powers for the same reason he didn't just punch a hole in everyone in frozen time: dude wanted to test his abilities and thought he wouldn't need em
[0:31:21] <RyuuAoi> I appreciate that
[0:31:22] <DianaTheAscian> were actually disturbing similar ethnically as well
[0:31:22] <alexandrecau> @gogo_gadgette tower fight with genichiro done, met a ,monkey but not a big one
[0:31:32] <RyuuAoi> Hell yeah!
[0:31:33] <@Solidus_113> GET ON IT

[0:32:10] <%FeelinNifty> Okay! Donations over. Time to leave!
[0:32:11] <%Aussie_Manny> Lets strem now.
[0:32:11] <+gogo_gadgette> ooooh i know exactly. thanks @alexandrecau
[0:32:12] <+El_Tacobandito> I always figured dio was just too prideful and sure of his stand to even consider using his vampire powers
[0:32:14] <Jcool498> Which is better One of the Dark Souls or Sekiro?
[0:32:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> Pat streams start with an hour of this
[0:32:15] <masterfire23> still not as long as pats
[0:32:18] <RyuuAoi> FUCK. Now I gotta play Bayo.
[0:32:18] <+D00msDayDan> what has woolie never watched a pat or paige stream? wait don't answer that
[0:32:20] <%GinAndRoses> can't wait until it's Pat level of just an hour long podcast before game
[0:32:22] <Jetsfantasy> It's okay, you had a backlog or whatnot
[0:32:25] <+Double_Tap_That> You'll never be as bad as Pat
[0:32:26] <Dragon_Batman> LUL I love em but you should see Paige and Pats
[0:32:29] <masterjayshay> Woolie you are way too good to us.
[0:32:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> first 30 mins in summary: fuck game of thrones lol
[0:32:31] <SixthSun2> A guest huh?
[0:32:33] <CAPSLOCKlive> How dare you be so popular and charming that you must devote time to trade plesantries with the audience!
[0:32:36] <$FuqBoiSlim> I wanted to play w101 again but the internal fan in my wii u is busted, so it just shuts off to prevent overheating after 10 minutes pknFBM
[0:32:38] <RyuuAoi> It's cool. Tying up loose ends. Don't complain. Enjoy the ride.
[0:32:43] <DomunDomunDomun> Still twice as fast as Pat's streams.

[0:35:20] <@Solidus_113> you need all the bottom skills before you can get Shadowrush
[0:35:24] <+zanzibar_junker> presence is great
[0:35:34] <DXLelouch24> Woolie you want the skill that gets you back life every deathblow, style wont keep you alive
[0:35:47] <Dragon_Batman> I think he got it last stream
[0:36:01] <hassanico> Doesn't the abandoned Dungeon lead to Mibu or the mountain?
[0:36:22] <+zanzibar_junker> presence and eyes are a must
[0:36:24] <Dragon_Batman> the mountain is one I think
[0:36:27] <%Rawpost> both
[0:36:31] <Liwyn> no game audio?
[0:36:41] <TheNamelessGun> Anyone want to run a Kickstarter for FromSoftware so they can afford to license a second font?
[0:36:45] <chicken_brotherr> mountain for sure, mibu I can't remember
[0:36:57] <Liwyn> oh ok
[0:36:57] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:37:03] <Dragon_Batman> He already found Mibu any way
[0:37:14] <convo445> buy money bags for money banks
[0:37:17] <gigacanuck> @TheNamelessGun hey man, there are so many better things to spend money on in videogame development
[0:37:21] <hassanico> Personally I would definitely go to the mountain, the monks are fun
[0:37:28] <Jetsfantasy> Remember you can buy pouches if you're scared about losing money
[0:37:29] <chicken_brotherr> did he fight o'ren yet?
[0:37:45] <Djinnazz> i don't think so
[0:37:52] <+zanzibar_junker> leaping kicks are dope
[0:37:53] <chicken_brotherr> oh boy
[0:37:54] <Dragon_Batman> Which was that?
[0:38:32] <chicken_brotherr> o'ren is the ghost mini-boss you fight before corrupted monk
[0:38:36] <+El_Tacobandito> oren gave me more trouble than corrupted monk
[0:38:37] <Dragon_Batman> He will need to do that tho
[0:38:58] <CloudCircus> Hi Billy
[0:39:03] <resloxxx> The purple gourd
[0:39:04] <Dragon_Batman> oooh no he hasn't yet

[0:39:13] <@Solidus_113> no you already bought that bead
[0:39:19] <Dragon_Batman> hasn't gone further than the entrance of Mibu
[0:39:27] <gigacanuck> game audio soon please?

[0:44:27] <$FuqBoiSlim> ugh...
[0:44:29] <%wujak> if you have one of the new gen dualshocks you can set it to actually use the wired connection in the device settings
[0:44:31] <RyuuAoi> To be fair, there is interference EVERYWHERE
[0:44:32] <+MadMatt2099> Only the new-gen controllers have the "true wired" function.
[0:44:36] <+Javaa01> You need to set wired to be actually wired in the PS4 options
[0:44:41] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus you should have a ghetto wired controller as a backup lol, this is a strange problem
[0:44:43] <samuraijakanddaxter> bring back wires

[1:03:03] <hassanico> Sekiro is to stupid to hold this kite in place unfortunately
[1:03:05] <RyuuAoi> KITE HYPE
[1:03:06] <@Menitta> "A Sneaky surprise attack as the round begins!"
[1:03:14] <%conflict1914> your boss calls you in to see him after work and Vergil 2 starts playing what do you do

[1:03:19] <Mythundare> I had a stunt kite, it was fun
[1:03:30] <RyuuAoi> It's fun but I always lose them. ALWAYS
[1:03:31] <aimlesshealer> You can divebomb your kite into the ground so hard it breaks, so there's that...
[1:03:33] <%Wool> I forgot kites existed until just now
[1:03:38] <hassanico> @Tucker0603 i don't think he approached that part of Ashina castle
[1:03:52] <$Tuskor13> fuck those guys who bring their $800 kites to the same place as the kids with their spiderman kites
[1:04:02] <Matthew_Sheridan> Making your own kites sounds cool as hell.

[1:04:22] <primaryfire> you ever fly your kite, look away for a second and then have it come crashing down with a calling card attached
[1:04:38] <samuraijakanddaxter> you dont need friends for anything
[1:04:39] <convo445> the next level is gliding around with a parachute
[1:04:39] <aimlesshealer> A really nice kite would be a great gift for a kid, I need to remember that. 'Cause the kites I had suuuuucked
[1:04:43] <$Tuskor13> If you have a $800 kite you don't bring it in the place the kids are trying to fly their Walmart kites
[1:04:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> namu namu desu nyan <3

[1:14:37] <gigacanuck> Benkei I believe
[1:14:57] <a_mad_dragon> musashi was too scared to fight the old monk LUL
[1:15:04] <+Keith_Chop> gintoki did the same thing in gintama
[1:15:19] <hassanico> oh, Benkei's a pretty famous monk in his own right
[1:15:37] <+Keith_Chop> beat people up with a souvenir wooden sword he got from kyoto
[1:15:38] <chicken_brotherr> Musashi vs the 70 students was so hype

[1:17:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Flame of Recca was hyped
[1:17:55] <JetpackMcQuack> XD
[1:17:56] <Goergorion> I 'member
[1:17:58] <@Menitta> I WAS ALMOST DONE WITH THAT
[1:17:59] <%Lion_kun> Flame of Recca was bad
[1:17:59] <%king_wragles> to be honest, I thought Billy made up an anime for a bit...
[1:18:06] <shotgang86> Go read Gantz to have "something" as an end
[1:18:14] <cool_culainn> The heck is flame of rekka??
[1:18:14] <hassanico> Time for the grossest enemy
[1:18:15] <arkv01> flame of recca had a great OP
[1:18:21] <@Menitta> Ah the GBA. Perfect for fighting games

[1:18:48] <SixthSun2> Now I have not seen Flamas Wrecka
[1:18:49] <Matthew_Sheridan> I remember reading a few Flame of Recca scanslations like a billion years ago.
[1:18:49] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus Flame of What?
[1:18:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It aired on a local channel as a kid
[1:18:54] <arkv01> yeah all these goddamn zoomers
[1:18:54] <%mintyrobo> I heard of it, but never bothered watching it
[1:18:56] <@Solidus_113> Flame of Recca
[1:18:57] <%Zombino924> flame of recca is great
[1:19:01] <chicken_brotherr> More like BoomerVS
[1:19:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Flame of Recca was like side by side with Yu Yu Hakusho
[1:19:04] <NeroInfinite> I have not, then again Falme of Rekka was not on my radar in that time
[1:19:06] <hassanico> You are GROSS
[1:19:08] <%Zombino924> it's also by the same guy who did MAR
[1:19:08] <BradNu> Ive heard of the manga
[1:19:10] <Prevot> I have no idea what Flame Eureka is
[1:19:14] <@Menitta> Flame of Recca? More like...LAME of Recca
[1:19:20] <aimlesshealer> Ewwwwwwww
[1:19:21] <+SeventhVice> Yu yu hakusho is just better
[1:19:24] <Mendin> ...Also that guy is puking roaches

[1:21:57] <hassanico> yo Rice rules
[1:21:59] <@Solidus_113> Rice is magical

[1:22:07] <%Lion_kun> ENYA
[1:22:09] <TrashLeviathan> i wonder if the crickets have something to do with the centipede
[1:22:15] <%hooppawesomeness> i need dat rice
[1:22:17] <tattleworm> i like having a talking souls protagonist who responds to this stuff with "the fuck?"
[1:22:25] <chicken_brotherr> shove some grain in this dusty skinbag
[1:22:28] <Mendin> That lady really loves her praying
[1:22:32] <%king_wragles> She has that Greyworm teh
[1:22:33] <%hooppawesomeness> its supposed to be the same lady i think?
[1:22:33] <Mendin> ...and rice
[1:22:34] <JetpackMcQuack> 1989's Japanese
[1:22:39] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus it's not the same lady
[1:22:42] <%CoolerThanChaos> CoolerThanChaos subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[1:23:13] <Mendin> Daruma san ga koronda
[1:23:14] <DracaenaLeaf> Darumaka?
[1:23:21] <$FuqBoiSlim> darmanitan??
[1:23:26] <leonsnixon> Spinoni tings
[1:23:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Seeing Pat playing in English made me nauseous
[1:23:34] <%conflict1914> oh yeah i know about that
[1:23:38] <hassanico> you paint one eye white to make a wish, and when it comes true you paint the other eye white
[1:23:43] <wintrale> I remember Darmanitan!
[1:23:47] <Djinnazz> the king of SIT.
[1:23:48] <samuraijakanddaxter> his arms n legs fell off
[1:23:49] <aimlesshealer> Well that seems healthy
[1:23:56] <wintrale> I loved that little guy.
[1:24:05] <%galaxyswirl> @WoolieVersus have you seen the immortal monks from japan? they turned themselves into mummies while they were alive
[1:24:06] <Djinnazz> Also i don't believe that.
[1:24:10] <Prevot> what a loser
[1:24:11] <henshin2289> Pro Tip: Running low on spirit emblems? Try NOT USING THEM lol XD
[1:24:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hope woolie uses the flame barrel here
[1:24:22] <%king_wragles> LUL
[1:24:24] <hassanico> COOL HAT DUDE
[1:24:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Remember to get up and stretch every 30 minutes chat
[1:24:30] <a_mad_dragon> also founded shaolin kung fu
[1:24:32] <Djinnazz> how can you reach enlightenment when you let your body rot?
[1:24:33] <hassanico> why are straw ronin hats so cool
[1:24:47] <Mendin> These guys are awesome and I fucking hate them
[1:24:47] <saraizarai> I had somehow forgotten that Sekiro exists. Huh
[1:24:48] <SixthSun2> The straw hat and the straw cloak is a hype combo for ninjas
[1:24:52] <chicken_brotherr> what a chump, hunterxhunter had a guy who prayed by punching all day and he was a badass
[1:25:01] <%doughvatkyn> they look so cool but if you fuck up it takes so long to fight them
[1:25:02] <$FuqBoiSlim> that's real cool guy but you're missing half ya swings
[1:25:10] <samuraijakanddaxter> theres guys in india who hold their arms up for so long that they just rot and undergo rigor mortis before the guys even die
[1:25:15] <worldbrand> PogChamp
[1:25:21] <Graxe_> Oh yeah these guys
[1:25:22] <SixthSun2> ANOTHER ONE
[1:25:23] <alexandrecau> wollie vs monks
[1:25:28] <Graxe_> The cool monks
[1:25:38] <SixthSun2> Woolie VS Bhuddism
[1:25:50] <Slimeking_Mike> Killed one of these guys first try PogChamp
[1:26:00] <Graxe_> These monks have explicitly forsaken Buddha
[1:26:07] <NeroInfinite> clang
[1:26:19] <Graxe_> Because immortality, man
[1:26:28] <aimlesshealer> Helicopter man!
[1:26:33] <Dragon_Batman> That was a hard all out
[1:26:36] <%doughvatkyn> whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh
[1:26:40] <+Implosivestar> ayyy whats up @WoolieVersus and chat
[1:26:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:26:45] <aimlesshealer> soisoisoisoisoisoi
[1:26:51] <+Keith_Chop> basically levi from AOT
[1:26:55] <+Implosivestar> good luck with area dude
[1:26:59] <+InstiGaitan> These guys were a bitch to fight I always skipped them
[1:27:02] <Graxe_> If this was more like a Souls game, you'd get their weapon and some of their moveset.
[1:27:02] <Mendin> So that monk jumped in the air, swung his blade at the ground, and, still in mid-air, used it as a launching lever to MACH DASH
[1:27:08] <SixthSun2> This is literally a Souls character fighting a DMC character
[1:27:09] <%HRDSalami654> Contentrated Woolie.
[1:27:10] <Mendin> I never really appreciated that move until now
[1:27:26] <%doughvatkyn> shuriken would be nice here
[1:27:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ded
[1:27:29] <$trueherobappo> What kind of weapon is that anyways?
[1:27:32] <TrashLeviathan> yea these guys are rad
[1:27:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> F
[1:27:38] <samuraijakanddaxter> mortis
[1:27:38] <DukeBlack_> awww damn
[1:27:40] <Mendin> double bladed staff/glaive?
[1:27:44] <$trueherobappo> I might end up using that in my DND campaign.
[1:27:44] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus just run past everything
[1:27:47] <SixthSun2> Souls character vs DMC character
[1:27:50] <UnfilteredComic> Has woolie seen the latest jojo episode
[1:27:53] <+thackattack00> i never learned how to properly fight those guys
[1:27:55] <Mendin> Twin Naginata?
[1:28:16] <%hooppawesomeness> there is no proper way lmao
[1:28:29] <CirclesForever> they should put ninjas in this game
[1:28:34] <CirclesForever> ninjas are cool
[1:28:49] <$Tuskor13> Naginata is just a katana on a big stick and I fucking adore them
[1:29:09] <rad_dude123465> Naginatas are the fucking coolest, I hope they‚Äôre in Nioh 2
[1:29:10] <leonsnixon> Most enemies can be parried and counter attacked until death
[1:29:11] <hassanico> @UnfilteredComic no
[1:29:11] <samuraijakanddaxter> just ki
[1:29:15] <JetpackMcQuack> I'm waiting for Afro Samurai DLC
[1:29:15] <%Lion_kun> shurkien them out the air
[1:29:16] <$Tuskor13> "I want to stab that guy with my sword but I don't want to get into range where he can stab me with his sword. Let me make my handle bigger."
[1:29:16] <Dragon_Batman> It's a dual Naginata even
[1:29:16] <+Implosivestar> they normally give you a special item if you beat all of them in the area
[1:29:17] <+Rada150> naginata is just a pole arm just like a halberd is an axe on a stick
[1:29:23] <$cureneckbeard> Ê≠ª
[1:29:25] <+zzNamttamzz> antiair deathblow
[1:29:25] <Dragon_Batman> dual sided I should say
[1:29:25] <+EySoyCoco> yeah, they weak to swords
[1:29:27] <hassanico> are those cicadas, damn that's loud
[1:29:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> just kill them
[1:29:37] <Goergorion> Shurikan while they are air born
[1:29:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> anti air dethblow reks them
[1:29:49] <chicken_brotherr> has Woolie ever read Kingdom?
[1:30:01] <+Implosivestar> regular jump attack reks them lol
[1:30:20] <%hooppawesomeness> @desudesudokidoki whens the opening? i swear i tried for like 20 minutes
[1:30:47] <%Rawpost> the monks can be one shotted by aerial death blow
[1:31:16] <Djinnazz> oh shit, those weeds actually burn.
[1:31:35] <hassanico> I've never seen anyone stealth kill the naginata guys
[1:31:48] <TurtleButter> Oh damn a Guan Dao, that's rad
[1:31:54] <+Implosivestar> sweep
[1:31:59] <%Lion_kun> sweep, jump
[1:32:25] <$Tuskor13> This guy is SO COOL what the hell
[1:32:27] <%Lion_kun> use shuriken woolie
[1:32:28] <gigacanuck> the camera is truly the hardest opponent in this game
[1:32:32] <%Lion_kun> hit him out the air
[1:32:33] <+Implosivestar> if theey have a stab they never use it
[1:32:48] <hassanico> wait so these guys' weakness is shuriken in midair?
[1:32:54] <cool_culainn> Yep
[1:32:54] <%king_wragles> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:32:55] <deviljhojho_> Nice moves
[1:32:57] <Dragon_Batman> Sick air deflect woolz
[1:32:59] <$Tuskor13> Who is this badass?!
[1:33:08] <%hooppawesomeness> woolieYE woolieYE
[1:33:10] <Mendin> Also the Anti-Air Deathblow technique can getem
[1:33:18] <%king_wragles> @Tuskor13 just a dude with a double guan-dao
[1:33:21] <+Implosivestar> their weakness is anti air so jump attack anti air deathblow shuriken hard pressure into frequent jump attacks
[1:33:35] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think he has purchased anti air yet
[1:33:47] <Dragon_Batman> It's probably in the box
[1:33:48] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:33:52] <+Implosivestar> very hard enemy at every level of the game :(
[1:33:54] <$Tuskor13> Okay this is going to be a lame pull but this guy looks like Jax from League of Legends. Say what you want about the game but that character is rad
[1:34:20] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus apparently these guys' weakness is getting hit while midair
[1:34:25] <leonsnixon> Woolie makes these fights so much more cinematic than they have to be
[1:34:28] <%king_wragles> Imagine if this guy had a real weapon... like a gun
[1:34:29] <+Implosivestar> @Tuskor13 He's the champion of the arena and the grandmaster of arms
[1:34:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @hooppawesomeness bait out the particular jump they do when they jump up high and then come spinning at you, the windup is slow so you have a good chance of getting it then.
[1:34:32] <$trueherobappo> @WoolieVersus Temple Jax
[1:34:41] <Basement25> woolie not understanding you need to go in
[1:34:44] <$trueherobappo> @Tuskor13 Temple Jax.
[1:34:49] <$Tuskor13> @BappoSama EXACTLY. Temple Jax is my fucking AESTHETIC
[1:35:07] <$trueherobappo> @Tuskor13 I prefer God Staff though.
[1:35:21] <+Implosivestar> HYPE
[1:35:23] <Dragon_Batman> Nice exploit
[1:35:25] <%doughvatkyn> that is satisfying to see
[1:35:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PogChamp
[1:35:34] <+EndgameContent> ICHI
[1:35:35] <Slimeking_Mike> VERY CLEAN
[1:35:37] <henshin2289> Pro Tip: Sprint instead of jumping. The only time you should jump is for sweeps. It'll make the game way easier.
[1:35:38] <$Tuskor13> You even shoved him into the wall before you slit his throat that was lowkey cinematic
[1:35:40] <Mendin> So Woolie, did you notice that these guys have REALLY SHAGGY STRAW jackets?
[1:35:49] <%doughvatkyn> lookit those anime fights
[1:35:58] <%Lion_kun> now beat 3 at once
[1:36:10] <+Implosivestar> they never get easier lmao
[1:36:12] <$trueherobappo> @WoolieVersus It gets much better in like, 10 minutes.
[1:36:23] <Jetsfantasy> Senpou is one of my favorite areas
[1:36:25] <+Implosivestar> anti air is kind of inconsistent imo
[1:36:28] <Dragon_Batman> fuck that later segment, boy that shit is tough
[1:36:57] <%king_wragles> too zen to give a fuck I guess
[1:37:04] <@Solidus_113> use them!
[1:37:05] <hassanico> they're not worthless at all, sugars rule
[1:37:17] <SixthSun2> Yeah, Sugars are temp buffs, not for everyone
[1:37:39] <cool_culainn> They aren't useless, they give money when you sell them
[1:37:40] <xxshadowxx416> mind goblins
[1:37:45] <hassanico> Considering you don't have the stealth passive you should be shugging candies really
[1:37:55] <%hooppawesomeness> tbf like 2 of the sugars are good
[1:38:29] <Dragon_Batman> Seeing as he wants the stinger skill he'll be going for the stealth skill next
[1:38:34] <+Implosivestar> wait till mr x and his infinite sugar
[1:38:35] <%king_wragles> that was sad
[1:38:55] <SixthSun2> I do wonder how that bridge got broken
[1:38:55] <%king_wragles> they had like... 0 chance
[1:39:38] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> @WoolieVersus who/what possessed you two to play 3rd Birthday?
[1:39:52] <%king_wragles> @El_Desperad0 Eva, obviously
[1:40:01] <@Solidus_113> it was all Minh
[1:40:04] <zamzoph> >implying
[1:40:06] <gigacanuck> magpies
[1:40:13] <+Implosivestar> @El_Desperad0 interesting choice of words
[1:40:13] <zamzoph> bloody magpies
[1:40:14] <TrashLeviathan> picle pee
[1:40:14] <$Tuskor13> I thought that was going to be the Dark Souls Crow thing
[1:40:35] <xxshadowxx416> picle
[1:40:37] <@Solidus_113> you're missing an ability for the kite
[1:40:45] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus spoilers DansGame

[1:41:44] <hassanico> english rhyme thing @Tuskor13
[1:41:50] <gigacanuck> universal
[1:42:14] <Dragon_Batman> Ravens are like notorious for that I think
[1:42:25] <+Kavtech> Birds don't exist in real life, sharks, however do.
[1:42:33] <$Tuskor13> I think it's crows and ravens specifically that really get into taking coins and shit
[1:42:36] <+Idziman> you cant prove that birds are real
[1:42:39] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus You also have a Gourd Seed you can turn in!
[1:42:44] <xeros720> skysharks we call them
[1:42:47] <+MasterofallVikings> what about the birbs tho
[1:42:48] <%mensch> mensch subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[1:43:03] <samuraijakanddaxter> theres a bird that only steals blue things
[1:43:09] <leonsnixon> I can‚Äôt believe birds are flat
[1:43:09] <$Tuskor13> I've heard that people who treat crows and shit nicely occasionally get random jewelry and stuff from the birds
[1:43:33] <%ChiRithy> ChiRithy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[1:43:46] <+MasterofallVikings> but then why are there more flaconers than Crowers?

[1:44:06] <%Lion_kun> i never used it and I buy it all the time lol
[1:44:08] <hassanico> oh my god it's just colored stones
[1:44:14] <+RaziWraith> but prism stones throwback. BibleThump
[1:44:15] <$Tuskor13> @leonsnixon Broke: The Earth is Round. Woke. The Earth is Flat. Bespoke: The Earth is a bird's egg.
[1:44:16] <DianaTheAscian> its the stones in souls
[1:44:23] <@Solidus_113> prism stones
[1:44:27] <+TopTieramisu> prism stones in a pvp-less game? why
[1:44:30] <hassanico> BULGING coin purse

[1:44:37] <DianaTheAscian> but prism stones where cheap af
[1:44:40] <leonsnixon> Research earth egg theory

[1:46:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I heard that the Earth is a hollow Klein Bottle, and no one can convince me otherwise
[1:46:10] <zamzoph> Why would you consume consumables anyway? ü§î
[1:46:13] <$Tuskor13> I thought armored birds was that death raptor in Australia
[1:46:14] <+Implosivestar> those are your dragons treasure
[1:46:19] <+MasterofallVikings> did you say ESTUS FLASK!?
[1:46:28] <+The_UnfathoMarble> Worst case senario, you can farm them around here quite easily
[1:46:37] <Jetsfantasy> Coin purses at least?
[1:46:41] <$Tuskor13> All things considered "that death ___ in Australia" can be applied to literally everything
[1:46:48] <+Implosivestar> We now know woolie the type of gamer to see a new item in the shop and not insta buy it
[1:47:05] <+Implosivestar> or at least we are reminded
[1:47:19] <$Tuskor13> Like that death plant that if you touch it you get agonizing pain that's so intense and lasts so long it's driven people and animals alike to suicide.
[1:47:23] <$Tuskor13> Shocker it's in Australia.

[1:58:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> cmonBruh people dont tip
[1:58:29] <DianaTheAscian> i over tip and iam not black
[1:58:31] <Byronic_dreamer> That move is awesome, not the best damage but it looks rad and hits a lot.
[1:58:32] <@Solidus_113> I don't tip because i'm broke as fuck
[1:58:35] <Djinnazz> That's not an excuse.
[1:58:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wait, is that a thing people really believe? Huh
[1:58:37] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus you just fell for the grift LUL
[1:58:38] <JetpackMcQuack> Something bad happened to that popcorn 1/5th of the way down
[1:58:38] <+Kavtech> I don't tip because tipping is weird and fucked up.
[1:58:43] <%conflict1914> is tipping in Canada as bad as it is in America?
[1:58:46] <@Menitta> I overtip usually despite how much I hate tipping as a concept
[1:58:50] <%Ulizez001> Y I K E S
[1:58:52] <AMajorTom> One time, in high school, at a pizza place a big group was leaving, and had a table full of leftovers that they were abandoning. My friends and I feasted.
[1:58:53] <samuraijakanddaxter> so nobody seen him
[1:58:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its ok if no one sees :)
[1:58:59] <+Double_Tap_That> Bold of you to assume Minh has shame

[1:59:06] <shotgang86> in my KOKORO
[1:59:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> RAISED BY GOD
[1:59:19] <natebud> If you live on a U.S. border town, Canadians don't tip well either, so Woolie is doing twice the overtipping he usually would.
[1:59:20] <gigacanuck> @conflict1914 eh, 15% standard
[1:59:21] <$FuqBoiSlim> HALLELUJAH
[1:59:22] <@Menitta> There's no point in putting a tip in a tipjar if nobody sees it.
[1:59:24] <@Solidus_113> Shame powered by Jesus
[1:59:26] <+Eclipse_knight_> i was picked up a sour patch off the ground and ate it, i understand the temptation
[1:59:26] <leonsnixon> Catholic guilt
[1:59:29] <rad_dude123465> Stealing leftover popcorn is Minh‚Äôs ninja way
[1:59:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The house that Woolie built
[1:59:33] <Prevot> jeebus knows
[1:59:44] <DXLelouch24> im a christian Woolie, the shame can be defeated, your just not trying hard enough
[1:59:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Shame powered by Jesus sounds like a podcast title
[1:59:56] <gigacanuck> one time I found an unopened pack of cookies on the sidewalk; they were fucking delicious
[1:59:57] <DXLelouch24> you must unlock your ULTRA INSTINCT
[2:00:02] <+EndgameContent> Not tipping because having to tip is the symptom of a flawed system is stupid. People live off those tips.
[2:00:03] <%Sopapiglobo100> futa porn and stolen popcorn
[2:00:05] <@Solidus_113> sell your sugars
[2:00:07] <+zanzibar_junker> It's good for a quest
[2:00:13] <GoldeNOVA> Woolie's guilt of betraying god Kappa

[2:00:33] <RyuuAoi> @dxlelouch24 Amen
[2:00:39] <dustworthmain> you have 2 coin purses...
[2:00:42] <FackinCrazy> Servers in canada get paid at least min wage so its not expected to tip
[2:00:43] <DXLelouch24> also at the end of the day popcorn didnt even exist in bible times sooooooo
[2:00:44] <leonsnixon> Sugars?
[2:00:44] <DXLelouch24> yea
[2:00:45] <TrashLeviathan> one time i found an entire pizza at a park and i seriously questioned whether or not i should @WoolieVersus

[2:13:36] <Prevot> fucking Cartman
[2:13:42] <DXLelouch24> i still eat the chicken but i eat it AFTER the skin
[2:13:43] <%KingLlama1> is there a restaraunt that JUST sells the skin ?
[2:13:44] <@Solidus_113> Minh you're not alone on this
[2:13:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Dane Cook circe 2009
[2:13:48] <+Melocholly> You can buy crispy chiken skins
[2:13:54] <RyuuAoi> Fried. Baked. Don't you DARE trim that fat!
[2:14:00] <+zanzibar_junker> These guys do
[2:14:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The chicken is good, but the skin must be consumed first.
[2:14:04] <samuraijakanddaxter> i was just thinkin abt that episode earlier lmaooo
[2:14:27] <samuraijakanddaxter> it absolutely breaks kenny
[2:14:29] <NeroInfinite> ..
[2:14:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Best kind of chicken is Shake n Bake made with the pork mix. It's not even fucking close.
[2:14:37] <DianaTheAscian> omfg
[2:14:38] <NeroInfinite> why tho
[2:14:47] <Djinnazz> uh oh
[2:14:47] <TrashLeviathan> f?

[2:14:55] <KoyFoster> big f
[2:14:57] <a_mad_dragon> this is making me want to hit up the richmond night market

[2:15:03] <TrashLeviathan> 1fps gang
[2:15:06] <$Tuskor13> Okay listen I get eating fired chicken skin but I wouldn't trust a place that only sells the skin.
[2:15:08] <worldbrand> we briefly hit seconds per frame, but we're good now
[2:15:09] <Mendin> Chicken Cracklins
[2:15:10] <NaturalGear> f is for frames
[2:15:13] <@Menitta> ok its good
[2:15:19] <RyuuAoi> YOU ARE NOT ALONE, BILLY
[2:15:23] <dimensaur> They have chicken skins that are like pork rinds
[2:15:28] <+zanzibar_junker> Chicken killing the fps
[2:15:29] <Maids4lyfe> the stream is getting clogged by the chicken skin
[2:15:39] <%GinAndRoses> you're falling on that sword for others
[2:15:49] <RyuuAoi> You're making the ultimate sacrifice, Billy
[2:15:49] <%doughvatkyn> not much healthier since the chicken absorbs a lot of oil anyway
[2:15:51] <%invisi_bliss> slightly
[2:15:52] <alexandrecau> Woolie that's wrong they are gonna be depressed and eat grease residue
[2:15:56] <TungstenViper> The fried oil wills till be in the chicken tho LUL
[2:16:06] <0rond> skin is almost pure trash for your body
[2:16:06] <Dragon_Batman> No cuz your taking a good part from it dammit
[2:16:07] <+D00msDayDan> i'll take your chicken daddy
[2:16:12] <TheTakkster> "Healthier"
[2:16:14] <dimensaur> You're doing them a service by taking the unhealthy parts away
[2:16:18] <worldbrand> even if i saw you separate the skin with a clean fork and knife, i'm not sure i would eat your skinless chicken
[2:16:25] <Prevot> eating Minh's leftover chicken is like eating random people's leftover popcorn

[2:16:29] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:16:35] <Fadedblank247> There's a place here in kc called Strouds that pan fries chicken and its the best
[2:16:38] <+zanzibar_junker> Fuck off with that
[2:16:45] <0rond> the skin isn't just about the flavour, the crave is for the crunch
[2:16:52] <RoboXGP> I boof the chicken skin up my a**
[2:16:56] <%GinAndRoses> but it aint crispy tho
[2:17:26] <worldbrand> I wish i had access to a tub of KFC spices to roll my karaage with
[2:17:31] <hassanico> wow Woolie is flip turned upside down
[2:17:34] <+gogo_gadgette> That‚Äôs like accepting a whole banana from someone without the peel
[2:17:50] <TheTakkster> There are a million places to get chicken, and only one place you can get kfc chicken skin. If you're in KFC, you're there for that skin
[2:17:57] <0rond> they opened a kfc-like here (we don't have kfc in my country) and it's sooo traaash
[2:18:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:18:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Look. I'm a guy who loves chicken. Some call me a chicken head (please don't tho). And the best chicken is shake n bake chicken you make with the pork mix. If you haven't had it you need to.
[2:18:10] <DrStinkers> Itchy. Crispy. Tasty.
[2:18:13] <%galaxyswirl> yeyeyeye i love this part of the zone

[2:19:35] <Dragon_Batman> gatdam ye that sounds good
[2:19:37] <worldbrand> that's basically karaage you're describing, just do it with thigh meat and maybe add panko to the flour
[2:19:40] <0rond> it's dark souls time
[2:19:41] <%Order_of_Mystery> meat attached to bone is disgusting. i hate the risk of biting into cartilage

[2:24:24] <tattleworm> ring the bell ring the bell ring the bell
[2:24:26] <0rond> there's enough in a playthough to give everyone every drink, and hear all the lore from them, but you should know that it's possible to proceed too far and make it no longer possible to give it to them
[2:24:32] <$trueherobappo> RING IT!!!!
[2:24:34] <%doughvatkyn> OK NOW RING THE BELL
[2:24:36] <+NerevaRising> Liam played the whole game with the bell on, do it coward @WoolieVersus
[2:24:37] <Mendin> DO IT YOU COWARD
[2:24:37] <$trueherobappo> DO IT COWARD!
[2:24:38] <hassanico> RING BELL

[2:24:52] <rad_dude123465> RING THE BELL OF AWAKENING
[2:25:00] <Dragon_Batman> Don't be like Max
[2:25:01] <%doughvatkyn> nice strategy setting fire to the ground around yourself to trap you in
[2:25:04] <rad_dude123465> DO IT COWARD, FUCKING DO IT
[2:25:11] <SixthSun2> Minh be killing people on SIGHT
[2:25:15] <$trueherobappo> It's actually much worse.
[2:25:17] <@Menitta> what does it do
[2:25:18] <alexandrecau> no chance minh
[2:25:21] <%KingLlama1> covenant of champions
[2:25:26] <hassanico> Summon the BELL DEMON
[2:25:28] <0rond> it's more like the champion's covenant from DS2
[2:25:37] <hassanico> Bell Demon is cool, you can dispel it at any time
[2:25:43] <Dragon_Batman> You can turn it off at least
[2:25:48] <weissguard> YEYEYE
[2:25:56] <alexandrecau> minh is that nemesis in shadow of war that fucks you up , cheap as hell and has no chance
[2:26:37] <$trueherobappo> Actually wrong..
[2:26:44] <+SouLucha> Woolie, use the bell it helps alot.
[2:26:50] <hassanico> divine confettus
[2:26:53] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can get here super early, you just can't get to the rest of Senpou Temple
[2:26:53] <$trueherobappo> You can actually get here super early in the game. ._.
[2:26:56] <+S7R4W83RRY> Liam rang the bell at the beginning of the game, and had the demon active for the whole playthrough
[2:27:04] <+SouLucha> It's really easy to disengage the bell.
[2:27:07] <RyuuAoi> You can ring my bell. Ring my bell. My bell.
[2:27:15] <+SouLucha> But really worth using it.
[2:27:17] <hassanico> you only really need 2 confetti
[2:27:21] <%doughvatkyn> i left the bell demon on without realizing it for my first playthrough and it sucked
[2:27:26] <Slimeking_Mike> counter-terrorism
[2:27:32] <RoboXGP> those caves are where a immortal buddist dude goes to meditate
[2:27:40] <primaryfire> having the bell active doesn't actually make much of a difference in terms of difficulty.
[2:27:41] <+NerevaRising> Has he fought tinman yet?
[2:27:47] <+SouLucha> The amount of prostetic upgrades you get from it make it worth it.
[2:27:49] <$trueherobappo> no
[2:28:16] <%doughvatkyn> you get hit just hard enough that if you don't have that many prayer beads mistakes go from whoopsie to dead a lot faster
[2:28:35] <Kaypar> pogonaHenlo
[2:29:02] <$trueherobappo> Fan :/
[2:29:06] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Sword
[2:29:09] <0rond> there are good tools but they are late game
[2:29:11] <primaryfire> none that you have right now
[2:29:11] <$trueherobappo> Or Sword.
[2:29:12] <hassanico> Late game antighost tool near the end
[2:29:15] <+NerevaRising> Getting good
[2:29:15] <Mendin> Not one you have
[2:29:16] <Goergorion> sword
[2:29:23] <+Full_Hop_Shine> Going ham!
[2:29:29] <RyuuAoi> Use the gun
[2:29:30] <SixthSun2> Just pop the bitch
[2:29:31] <DXLelouch24> you can get fan from an npc in the same area as The Horse guy
[2:29:32] <NocturnalRites> the purple umbrella upgrade is a godsends for these and the shichimen
[2:29:35] <PhoenixPyrrhus> probably don't have purple umbrella
[2:29:37] <DXLelouch24> hole in roof
[2:29:44] <0rond> the final flamer and anti apparation umberalls are good
[2:29:46] <%Roasted_Pheasant> MonkaS
[2:29:46] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the purple umbrella is great
[2:29:48] <$trueherobappo> @NocturnalRites BIG FACTS
[2:29:51] <DrStinkers> NOTHING PERSONEL
[2:29:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> swing on him
[2:29:59] <$trueherobappo> @NocturnalRites Saved my ass so many times.
[2:30:24] <NocturnalRites> @BappoSama especially during the shichimen laser
[2:30:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Fatality
[2:30:36] <%doughvatkyn> HE GOT SOME MEAT
[2:30:37] <Mendin> THE ASS TO ASS
[2:30:39] <$Tuskor13> that sounds nasty
[2:30:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:30:42] <HoldBtoRun> You can hold left/right to quick swap back to the healing gourd
[2:30:43] <Mythundare> bye bye kidney
[2:30:46] <+Kavtech> Kreygasm
[2:30:49] <$trueherobappo> @NocturnalRites OH DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE LASER
[2:30:58] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you can get the fan in the same area as the Horse guy boss Gyobu, hes assuming he didnt leave yet in a house with a hole in it on the roof
[2:31:04] <%doughvatkyn> the fact that you can parry the laser is stupid
[2:31:05] <primaryfire> blackhat the rat sells a prosthetic tool that is good for this. he's in one of the side paths at ashina castle
[2:31:07] <RyuuAoi> He's slow but hiS status effects are FUCKED
[2:31:08] <0rond> @WoolieVersus you can hold the item scroll button to go to your gourd automatically
[2:31:11] <NaturalGear> Dattebayo
[2:31:14] <+NerevaRising> that crouch tech
[2:31:15] <masterfire23> mind goblins
[2:31:17] <natebud> Once you get the patterns down, an Ako sugar really speeds this fight up
[2:31:21] <%doughvatkyn> THE SECOND KIDNEY
[2:31:26] <Flarepulse> you didn't need that spine
[2:31:30] <hassanico> he has a projectile attack?!
[2:31:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hit the enemy
[2:31:41] <+Kavtech> How many shirikodama Wolf got anyway?
[2:31:50] <NocturnalRites> @BappoSama I only managed to get the anti air deathblow once on my first shichimen after that I failed everytime
[2:32:06] <Mendin> Ok Woolie is not constitutionally good for this kind of boss. Its whole mechanic set necessitates high aggression to get it down before the buffs go and the debuffs get too high
[2:32:12] <RyuuAoi> Lame it out, Woolie. Hit, retreat, hit, retreat.
[2:32:15] <Djinnazz> You just gotta get it @WoolieVersus
[2:32:19] <$trueherobappo> @NocturnalRites That anti-air deathblow kinda sucks tbh. :/
[2:32:22] <%doughvatkyn> you gotta stop jumping since his range is always gonna beat that jump from your attack range
[2:32:30] <hassanico> Woolie is panicking so hard
[2:32:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> you have confetti
[2:32:47] <Mendin> Would you say woolie is suffereing from ! TERROR !
[2:32:49] <+ItsRatman> time for purple umbrella
[2:32:53] <chroma3> yea screw headless, i hate them
[2:32:58] <NocturnalRites> @BappoSama yeah its super unreliable but if you can land it it makes the fight easier
[2:33:02] <RyuuAoi> Can't face fuck this dude
[2:33:07] <0rond> I think you need to have confetti active to anti air deathblow the schichimens, but if you hit them rapidly with confetti you will get them into a loop and they will very rarely jump
[2:33:08] <+zanzibar_junker> Leave it
[2:33:14] <DianaTheAscian> i forget r these guys even worth it?
[2:33:15] <Djinnazz> no, you DO face fuck this dude.
[2:33:16] <DXLelouch24> without confetta you wont do any damage really, the chipiest of chip damage
[2:33:18] <+thackattack00> you can super face fuck this dude
[2:33:23] <henshin2289> try blocking so you dont get hit
[2:33:25] <Mendin> The headless have Pretty Good Buff Items yeah
[2:33:30] <hassanico> @Nina96 this one is, others maybe not
[2:33:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> you said you didn't have any, just go in hes easy
[2:33:32] <primaryfire> confetti doesn't make a difference for deflecting
[2:33:33] <+zanzibar_junker> His stuff isn't good
[2:33:36] <duraju> FUCK FACE HIM CHEWIW
[2:33:37] <$trueherobappo> @0rond You don't need the confetti for the Shichimen
[2:33:43] <$FuqBoiSlim> woolie you HAVE to fuck his face
[2:33:51] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Take the sword and HIT IT TILL IT DIES
[2:33:52] <Mendin> this one has the red spiritfall which is great
[2:33:54] <RyuuAoi> No nooo no face fucking tonight.
[2:33:59] <tattleworm> that skill you can buy with carp scales when you've got confetti on is enough to debuff him in a single combo
[2:34:00] <hassanico> this cowardly play is hurting my soul
[2:34:01] <0rond> than i guess the air blow is just really finnicky
[2:34:22] <$trueherobappo> He has no head woolie..
[2:34:33] <duraju> fuck his neck hole
[2:34:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woolies fear jumps LUL
[2:35:07] <primaryfire> headlesa are legit 10 times easier than the game intimidates one to believe
[2:35:12] <natebud> blocked attacks cause damage too. make sure Woolie knows that
[2:35:16] <RyuuAoi> He's greedy, y'all.
[2:35:24] <+NerevaRising> just go for regular swings @WoolieVersus
[2:35:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie jumps arent helping
[2:35:34] <NocturnalRites> I was lame and saved most of hte headless till endgame
[2:35:36] <duraju> dont jump, deflect
[2:35:37] <%Roasted_Pheasant> How do you facefuck that which has no face?
[2:35:38] <Djinnazz> NO, SWING!
[2:35:43] <hassanico> He's explicitly the kinda boss you rush down
[2:35:46] <primaryfire> no you swing nonstop
[2:35:49] <hassanico> Use Ako's Sugar
[2:35:53] <+thackattack00> Spam spam spam
[2:35:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> just swing
[2:36:02] <duraju> dont jump
[2:36:03] <natebud> He does lots of chip damage, parrying is essential.
[2:36:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:36:09] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Just hit it from the back like you're jamaican
[2:36:18] <NocturnalRites> mostly cause it takes that long to get the umbrella upgrade
[2:36:19] <%doughvatkyn> the equivalent of being hit with a folding chair the SECOND you get in the ring
[2:36:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fear hops LUL
[2:36:52] <DianaTheAscian> is woolie gonna fight the other headless
[2:37:14] <NocturnalRites> also the underwater headles are panzies comapred to the land ones
[2:37:21] <RyuuAoi> HELL YEAH, @woolieversus ! Progress!
[2:37:46] <worldbrand> oh the hard way eh
[2:37:46] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:37:50] <+Kavtech> @NocturnalRites They kinda suck to fight though...
[2:37:53] <UnfilteredComic> Backhand builds terror
[2:38:04] <hassanico> why does he spam jump
[2:38:09] <hassanico> it's so bad
[2:38:10] <+NerevaRising> Those panic crouches...
[2:38:16] <Djinnazz> fear
[2:38:17] <NocturnalRites> cause he thinks it helps
[2:38:38] <RyuuAoi> @hassanico I mean it's kinda working. Must be working better than a roll for him.
[2:38:40] <primaryfire> jumping is an incredibly bad habit, even for this fight.
[2:38:50] <DianaTheAscian> panic jumping is your biggest enemy right now @WoolieVersus
[2:38:57] <b1gboss007> No Divine paper tho
[2:39:02] <0rond> i don't quite remeber, but you can still roll in the headless miasma?
[2:39:07] <natebud> if he doesn't do the grab, you can get a couple swings in off a teleport.
[2:39:12] <+SouLucha> Woolie, the Masochist... You could wait until you get the Purple Umbrella and Finger Whisle at least if you're going without confetti. This it good to learn his moveset at least.
[2:39:13] <hassanico> @RyuuAoi you're supposed to just rush it down in like 30 seconds to a minute, this isn't a protracted fight
[2:39:21] <$Retrash> no you can't roll or sprint when fighting headless
[2:39:30] <$trueherobappo> Huh
[2:39:40] <+RealRyanGee> why isn't he using confetti
[2:39:41] <+NerevaRising> Agree
[2:39:43] <%supersugoisenpai1> Are we ready?
[2:39:45] <0rond> minh why are you lying
[2:39:46] <primaryfire> if you're gonna jump literally only do it backwards
[2:39:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> tbf these are sorta endgame enemies
[2:39:51] <+NerevaRising> @realryang practice
[2:39:53] <$trueherobappo> That's an interesting mechanic: He doesn't attempt the grab if you turn the camera around fast enough..
[2:39:57] <alexandrecau> don't choke on your popcorn woolie
[2:40:00] <$trueherobappo> I never realized that until now..
[2:40:07] <DianaTheAscian> minh he almost gets hit every exchange
[2:40:07] <RyuuAoi> @realryang Training without. Saving consumables
[2:40:08] <+SouLucha> Sorry, Malcontent Finger Whisle.
[2:40:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL here we go
[2:40:21] <%king_wragles> You're lying cause WOOLIE WAS BORN READY
[2:40:22] <hassanico> Use Ako's Sugar!
[2:40:28] <NocturnalRites> @BappoSama yeah I used that trick a lot during these fights
[2:40:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> use a sugar
[2:40:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fiiiiine, Woolie can do it!
[2:40:50] <0rond> woolie is jumping for no reason and it's hurting him bad
[2:40:55] <+ItsRatman> the choke
[2:40:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie id you attack relentlessly you can break that "fog slow" hes doing
[2:41:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[2:41:03] <NocturnalRites> Man it really helps having more bosses under your belt when you face these guys
[2:41:06] <alexandrecau> puppet shove
[2:41:07] <Mendin> ASS 2 ASS
[2:41:08] <%invisi_bliss> he got dat booty
[2:41:09] <+NerevaRising> right in the pooper
[2:41:13] <LTKonnor> Is that animation him just pulling your anus out
[2:41:13] <$trueherobappo> @NocturnalRites I honestly didn't realize that. Holy gawd that's actually really useful. That grabbed fucked me up so bad..
[2:41:17] <b1gboss007> Stop jumping, become a parry wall
[2:41:17] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will succeed. He has overcome greater challenges. Remember Omnikron?
[2:41:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes still jumping LUL
[2:41:22] <$trueherobappo> Grab*
[2:41:22] <Patzzki217> the more he waits the worse hes going to do
[2:41:27] <0rond> woolie the jumping
[2:41:29] <primaryfire> jumping slashes deal ridiculously low damage
[2:41:31] <Mendin> Japanese folklore believed that the spirit was somewhere near the anus, so that ghost is literally buttvoring your soul
[2:41:31] <+chaumiester> Damn Japanese Folklore enemies.
[2:41:36] <GoldeNOVA> Bait the grab
[2:41:40] <+NerevaRising> lol
[2:41:41] <+RealRyanGee> not gonna lie this is painful to watch
[2:41:46] <UnfilteredComic> He stole your Kokoro
[2:41:47] <hassanico> very
[2:41:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolies too afraid to block because it causes terror LUL
[2:41:57] <hassanico> he forgot the confetti to boot
[2:41:59] <$GoogleyGareth> Oh I picked a great time to drop in
[2:42:00] <Mendin> Takin it o ut of yours, putting it in hi
[2:42:11] <0rond> doesn't blocking with confetti block the terror?
[2:42:15] <$trueherobappo> Also
[2:42:19] <natebud> Tell Woolie to pop a sugar for extra damage. Also swing on him if he doesn't do the grab.
[2:42:20] <Djinnazz> parrying does too
[2:42:24] <$trueherobappo> You can't sprint..
[2:42:24] <%doughvatkyn> perfect parry does it best
[2:42:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> use a sugar
[2:42:31] <$trueherobappo> while fighting these guys..
[2:42:33] <+RealRyanGee> omg
[2:42:42] <+RealRyanGee> how do these guys have the most viewers for sekiro rn
[2:42:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BappoSama
[2:42:54] <+SouLucha> Honestly, this is how I also feel fighting these things. It's possible but awkward as hell.
[2:42:56] <$trueherobappo> Sorry.
[2:42:58] <DianaTheAscian> f
[2:43:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[2:43:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Mendin Buttvore is the most horrible thing I've heard in a while and I hate that you brought this concept into my mind
[2:43:10] <0rond> @WoolieVersus the juping doesn't really help woolie, stand your ground and parry
[2:43:16] <0rond> only jump the sweeps
[2:43:19] <GoldeNOVA> Terror is such a shit mechanic, man
[2:43:21] <NocturnalRites> Cause the hype for this game has died and most people have moved on
[2:43:21] <Djinnazz> You can come back.
[2:43:22] <+ItsRatman> Does Woolie have Purple Umbrella?
[2:43:27] <Djinnazz> no
[2:43:29] <RyuuAoi> Getting dat health town though! @woolieversus
[2:43:31] <+chaumiester> Here's your problem. You need to use gun to win this battle
[2:43:33] <+SouLucha> Unless he stacks buffs and anti-ghost bullshit, these battles always go this way.
[2:43:33] <hassanico> I don't think he has umbrella at all
[2:43:34] <RyuuAoi> Down
[2:43:35] <+RealRyanGee> you got this bro
[2:43:38] <+RealRyanGee> headless is easy
[2:43:38] <NocturnalRites> Plus its Woolie he brings the people
[2:43:42] <hassanico> Confetti drops later
[2:43:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it takes 2 minimum to kill them
[2:43:46] <+zanzibar_junker> Leave it
[2:43:56] <+TheNewZealandStory> headless isnt difficult, just be aggressive
[2:44:00] <b1gboss007> Dont like cuz bad
[2:44:00] <hassanico> Use Ako's sugar, rush him down
[2:44:01] <NaturalGear> the prize isn't even worth it
[2:44:03] <+linSP> you cant let up at all
[2:44:04] <+zanzibar_junker> They suck
[2:44:12] <hassanico> @RupanSen this is the only one where the prize is worth it
[2:44:14] <$trueherobappo> Trades are fine as long as you win.
[2:44:18] <DXLelouch24> Woolie your being salty because you dont even have all your tools yet, this things a cakewalk later
[2:44:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> use a attack sugar
[2:44:21] <0rond> jumping takes a long time when you aren't really attacking efficiently, you are wasting the confetti time
[2:44:35] <NaturalGear> @hassanico or you can just use sugars
[2:44:35] <RyuuAoi> And people don't like trades. HARD SALES ONLY
[2:44:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> this is the run
[2:44:42] <$trueherobappo> @DXLelouch24 Big facts, especially with the ghost fan
[2:44:44] <hassanico> rup
[2:44:52] <duraju> bUT wHAt iF He nEEDS It lATeR
[2:44:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:44:53] <Djinnazz> stop using that!
[2:44:58] <hassanico> @RupanSen good luck coinvincing woolie of that
[2:45:06] <NocturnalRites> While the headless do suck the shichimen are worse
[2:45:38] <duraju> ! G R E E D !

[2:45:52] <+NerevaRising> You can
[2:45:53] <primaryfire> you don't have to respect this fight and can just come back when you're way stronger, kitted out and can buy confetti
[2:45:54] <Mendin> 2
[2:45:56] <+RealRyanGee> SUCH A WASTE SMH THIS IS PAINFUL
[2:46:01] <RyuuAoi> JUMPING SAVED HIM. JUMP

[2:46:31] <+dirtyjuice_> headless suck
[2:46:37] <0rond> THE JUMPING TAKES SO LONG
[2:46:39] <natebud> gonna need another sugar woolie
[2:46:42] <primaryfire> you can beat headless without confetti, just need more damage
[2:46:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dont be too greedy with strikes
[2:46:48] <%doughvatkyn> you still have pacifying
[2:46:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He retaliates
[2:47:02] <+RealRyanGee> sighhhhhh
[2:47:07] <+RealRyanGee> stress is real
[2:47:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Imagine this not having a pause like Souls games
[2:47:21] <+linSP> all in
[2:47:25] <+SouLucha> He could also just block his attacks without confetti if the headless near poise break.
[2:47:27] <jsavarin> go in please
[2:47:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> But if you're not greedy with strikes, it takes too long and the consumable wears off
[2:47:41] <+RealRyanGee> omg he skips over it smh
[2:47:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> GO IN
[2:47:59] <UnfilteredComic> GO IN

[2:48:45] <+SouLucha> BLOCK
[2:48:45] <UnfilteredComic> KEEP GOING
[2:48:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:48:48] <+TheNewZealandStory> why does he keep jumping around
[2:48:48] <Mendin> PICK UP THAT PHONE
[2:48:49] <+zetaplus> its not impossible
[2:48:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:48:51] <primaryfire> stop jumping, christ
[2:48:51] <Mendin> Cause I CALLED IT
[2:48:51] <hassanico> coward duck
[2:48:53] <duraju> F
[2:48:54] <RyuuAoi> If you jumped you would have blocked that.
[2:48:55] <$trueherobappo> F
[2:48:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You keep jumping LUL
[2:48:57] <+TheNewZealandStory> like, just stand there and attack him
[2:48:59] <tri3dgE027> The BACKDOWN, the COMEBACK
[2:48:59] <henshin2289> less jump more fight
[2:49:02] <%DangerMan83> blocking him is tough, easier to dodge
[2:49:03] <+RealRyanGee> smh
[2:49:03] <NaturalGear> you could've still won
[2:49:12] <+RealRyanGee> this guy is done
[2:49:12] <UnfilteredComic> Pat hates them too, they kinda suck
[2:49:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just come back later, man
[2:49:13] <Dragon_Batman> A little too defensive but yea that enemy sucks
[2:49:13] <TungstenViper> BE MORE AGGRESSIVE
[2:49:16] <chroma3> yea fuck headless
[2:49:16] <hassanico> there is literally no other use for the consumables
[2:49:16] <0rond> the panic jumping is screwing you over
[2:49:17] <+linSP> jump attacks deal so little damage
[2:49:17] <+ItsRatman> Damn it Woolie, you jump every attack except the easiest attack to jump
[2:49:18] <primaryfire> you can kill headless without confetti, you just need more damage
[2:49:19] <natebud> Parrying does way more work with an Ako.
[2:49:19] <DianaTheAscian> thats fine
[2:49:21] <mikesapartment> Hey I'm in the future and just want to tell you you're legit just bad jesus christ man
[2:49:21] <+RealRyanGee> HEADLESS IS EASY
[2:49:22] <+zanzibar_junker> ILeave it
[2:49:23] <RyuuAoi> How do you dodge?
[2:49:25] <+TheNewZealandStory> they arent difficult
[2:49:30] <+dirtyjuice_> @WoolieVersus You can farm divine confetti in ashina tower
[2:49:31] <%galaxyswirl> @WoolieVersus you can still kill him without the confetti, just takes a long time
[2:49:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Theyre near end game items
[2:49:35] <+zetaplus> you really dont need the confetti win
[2:49:37] <+dirtyjuice_> I have tons of them
[2:49:38] <b1gboss007> @scrubquotes
[2:49:39] <Shastafield> drop your shield
[2:49:41] <+SouLucha> Come back once you got a confetti and anti-ghost bullshit like purple umbrella and Malcontent Whistle.
[2:49:45] <+ThatButler> oh, but there are sillier ways to beat them later
[2:49:45] <Mendin> Woolie's playstyle is constitutionally opposed to effectively fighting that enemy
[2:49:46] <That_Mojo> you're not bad, it's just hard
[2:49:49] <+TheNewZealandStory> there isnt much to learn
[2:49:53] <+RealRyanGee> this guy needs to get gud bro
[2:49:58] <hassanico> @mojokingizakku you said that backwards
[2:50:02] <henshin2289> so salty over nothing
[2:50:03] <0rond> he is making it harder for humself by jumping
[2:50:03] <+RealRyanGee> learn what????
[2:50:03] <primaryfire> just come back like 4 bosses from now homie
[2:50:03] <+ItsRatman> are we allowed to spam hesitation quotes?
[2:50:04] <+TheNewZealandStory> they dont have many attacks and all of their attacks are slow
[2:50:05] <+ThatButler> Appreciate the struggle you had now, because it'll feel hilarious when you come back later.
[2:50:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> comedy gold
[2:50:13] <tri3dgE027> The SALTYness is so good
[2:50:13] <natebud> You should be attacking them as soon as they teleport. If they don't grab instantly, you can safely attack.
[2:50:14] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, you got his ass down. You are good enough!
[2:50:15] <LTKonnor> PJSalt
[2:50:17] <%jinking79> the fight not hard their just annoying
[2:50:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:50:19] <%galaxyswirl> you can still do it, just takes longer without the confetti
[2:50:21] <NocturnalRites> I think you have to teleport Woolie, I cant remember being able to get back from here by foot
[2:50:25] <+AmanDotZip> i feel like requiring consumables pressures you to learn quickly rather than slamming your head into a wall
[2:50:26] <rad_dude123465> ARMORED WARRIOR HYPE
[2:50:28] <+NerevaRising> #Scrubquotes
[2:50:31] <+RealRyanGee> well if you're so smart then
[2:50:34] <+RealRyanGee> make your own damn game
[2:50:35] <0rond> is it dark souls time?
[2:50:38] <+Idziman> there are ones that are much easier
[2:50:41] <GoldeNOVA> Terror is garbage
[2:50:42] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus come back later, your not HUGE enough yet
[2:50:45] <%galaxyswirl> confetti isnt mandatory, i feel like woolie needs to know this
[2:50:48] <+ItsRatman> woolie taking his rage out on poor innocent lizards
[2:50:57] <alexandrecau> ressource management is learning woolie
[2:50:59] <tri3dgE027> The underwater ones are easier, due to not needing Confetti
[2:51:00] <RyuuAoi> Pat hates Sekiro
[2:51:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just wait until you get the Pacifying Agent as a buyable item so you dont need to worry so much about losing them
[2:51:06] <0rond> woolie literally poisoning himself out of salt
[2:51:07] <hassanico> he does?
[2:51:08] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Pat said the same thing during the podcast right? That aspect of the game is the worst part of the entire game
[2:51:10] <henshin2289> you can learn by not using DC
[2:51:14] <worldbrand> I dunno, these are very optional
[2:51:17] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it's doable without confetti but it takes way longer than it needs to
[2:51:18] <+zetaplus> Confetti is not nessescary to beat that thing
[2:51:18] <jsavarin> @WoolieVersus Sekiro is just a game that focuses on aggression. Playing defensive means losing so much of all progress. It's pretty freaking scary
[2:51:18] <DianaTheAscian> y chat suddenly become a bunch of get gud garbage?
[2:51:22] <TungstenViper> @realryang dude...
[2:51:24] <TheTakkster> He doesn't hate sekiro. he does hate the headless and divine confetti
[2:51:27] <UnfilteredComic> 4Head
[2:51:31] <%doughvatkyn> i think the issue is that it's the only enemy that really requires resources to deal with in a reasonable amount of time
[2:51:31] <GoldeNOVA> @WoolieVersus Worse than Frenzy?
[2:51:35] <%king_wragles> just do it perfectly
[2:51:37] <+linSP> I really hope from does this confetti shit again, i think it makes the game funner
[2:51:37] <tri3dgE027> There is also an upgrade later on that trivializes the landbound Headless
[2:51:39] <+cvp5127> just do it flawlessly
[2:51:40] <Shastafield> 4Head just do
[2:51:48] <RyuuAoi> He hates that there is no replay value.
[2:51:50] <%doughvatkyn> i agree it's an easy enemy but fighting them the first time needing consumables is just not fun
[2:51:50] <+dirtyjuice_> but you can farm divine confetti
[2:51:56] <SixthSun2> Learning is half the battle
[2:51:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:51:57] <+nekodelic> but sekiro is bad tho @thetakkster
[2:51:58] <worldbrand> zatoichi had a sword, i-ai-i-ai-to
[2:52:02] <DXLelouch24> one you get the terror gourd hes a punk bitch
[2:52:07] <RyuuAoi> Just do it VoteYea
[2:52:08] <primaryfire> learn to stop jumping unless you see kanji
[2:52:13] <themagic_conch> bitch ass ghosts
[2:52:19] <henshin2289> you get as many shots as you want to learn
[2:52:22] <NocturnalRites> if you have the right skill and the purple umbrella upgrade you dont even need confetti
[2:52:23] <+WorldsBestPanda> Min just got impatient telling Woolie that he was ready before he was actually reayd.
[2:52:23] <hassanico> anyway onto the good boss now
[2:52:25] <%galaxyswirl> i think the problem is is that people think the confetti is mandatory
[2:52:25] <DXLelouch24> you cant just expect to be able to beat all the content min 1 woolie, thats not viablee
[2:52:27] <Dragon_Batman> I will say you do jump more than you should
[2:52:31] <0rond> it's not about what you should be doing, it's about what you shouldn't be doing which is jumping
[2:52:36] <+SouLucha> Being agressive and on point with blocks will kill anything! But seriously come back when you got that whisle and unbrella. You'll have an easier time.
[2:52:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> learning is great
[2:52:41] <TungstenViper> same thing as going first in the Catacombs in DS1
[2:52:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just gotta learn, that's always the hard part
[2:52:48] <henshin2289> you are though
[2:52:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but youre allowed, you just ran out of agents
[2:52:54] <+RealRyanGee> this guy is literally the most pettiest gamer i've ever heard speak
[2:52:55] <wirblewomble> Woolie, you don't have to learn to stop jumping
[2:52:59] <+TheNewZealandStory> you are allowed to though
[2:53:01] <hassanico> it's not about figuring him out though
[2:53:02] <%jinking79> if your jumping and u get hit u take double the damage
[2:53:06] <RyuuAoi> Learn to jump and dodge when yo ass about to get hit too
[2:53:07] <%Psyramics> you can learn how to fight him without consumables though
[2:53:07] <+linSP> you get more chances later, this is giving the skilled player the opportunity to get great loot early
[2:53:19] <DianaTheAscian> @tungstenviper u can still brute force that a bit
[2:53:27] <%doughvatkyn> arguably i don't even like the items that drop anyway
[2:53:27] <0rond> but yeah disliking them because they meant to be fought with consumebles is a legit take
[2:53:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HERE WE GO
[2:53:31] <hassanico> ANYWAY
[2:53:32] <0rond> DARK SOULS TIME
[2:53:34] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[3:00:00] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Sorry to ask, but I made a donation with Sekiro tips sometime after the last Sekiro stream. Did the donation get messed up or did you just read it between streams? 'Cause I can't seem to find you reading it out.
[3:00:01] <NaturalGear> they probably brought them from china

[3:00:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Knight dude
[3:00:15] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus it was Eugene
[3:00:16] <Mendin> Giant Dad
[3:00:16] <+InstiGaitan> The item used to upgrade the arm originally had a full on description about how the dad was on a journey to save his son
[3:00:18] <tri3dgE027> His name is GIANT DAD
[3:00:21] <+RealRyanGee> LOL EUGENE

[3:00:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus His son Robert was sick, they sold firecrackers to get to Sekiroland to find cure for his sickness (get immortality).
[3:00:48] <%Aussie_Manny> His name was Robert Paulson.
[3:00:51] <+NerevaRising> In key items @WoolieVersus
[3:00:51] <RyuuAoi> American?
[3:00:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it different?
[3:00:53] <natebud> The description for the item, not the prosteic
[3:00:56] <Patzzki217> Oh are they going to not pick up the red and white pinwheel?
[3:01:05] <primaryfire> in the description before you install them, they say that robert was sick and his dad travelled to seek a cure. they came to senpou because there's undead shit here
[3:01:09] <$trueherobappo> @Ulizez001 Well, you should really get it. It's super useful on certain bosses.
[3:01:18] <$trueherobappo> @Ulizez001 Unless you beat the game already..
[3:01:23] <+FlubbedPig> The item they're talking about was consume to make the prosthetic. You don't have it anymore.
[3:01:33] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's 2 tabs over
[3:01:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i think the fireworks were used right
[3:01:36] <$Retrash> you already fitted the firecracker into your arm so the item isn't there anymore
[3:01:38] <tattleworm> you trade the key item to make the prosthetic, you don't have it any more
[3:01:43] <hassanico> It was used up when you got Fireworks from the Sculptor
[3:01:44] <TrashLeviathan> you dont have it anymore
[3:01:49] <Mendin> You can read the description from the memrorial mobs that sold it
[3:01:49] <NocturnalRites> Yeah the items disappear once you fit it to the arm
[3:01:54] <UnfilteredComic> Its Japes
[3:01:55] <RyuuAoi> Use the fireworks on Headless.
[3:01:55] <primaryfire> csn you read it at the sculptor?
[3:01:58] <+NerevaRising> My bad, there's definitely there somewere
[3:01:59] <natebud> The only way you can see the description is if you go back to Crow mob. Since you used it to make the prosteic
[3:01:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> One of the Completed Prayer Beads gives more lore on them but i forgot which Completed Prayer bead it is.
[3:01:59] <+InstiGaitan> @WoolieVersus you used it to upgrade the arm with firecrackers
[3:02:00] <tri3dgE027> The prosthetic tools-requirement get removed from your Key Item when you already create the Tool
[3:02:01] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @BraverestWarrior

[3:08:45] <+nekodelic> same reasoning, you mean I think
[3:08:47] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Life deserve to continue until that life has been deemed to be bad for everyone else around them
[3:08:50] <@Menitta> We have rules for a reason, and without rules, we live with the animals
[3:08:50] <TungstenViper> people don't consdier animal pets deserving of the same kind of love as kids
[3:08:50] <Dragon_Batman> A reminder of how shitty people can be?
[3:08:55] <$trueherobappo> The only reason why i don't own any pets of any kind is because I can't deal with having to get rid of them for any reason..
[3:08:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Humans make me sad sometimes
[3:08:59] <Parapattern> People are a type of wild chimp

[3:17:42] <%GinAndRoses> don't question it ITS ENGLISH
[3:17:43] <@Menitta> Gif
[3:17:44] <Parapattern> I usually say marge-er-in
[3:17:44] <veldinmusic> Not to be that guy but theres some really good vegan butter thats WAAAAY better than margarine.
[3:17:44] <MUTILUX> English is the worst language
[3:17:46] <SixthSun2> Shhhhh, englsh is super inconsitent
[3:17:46] <Patzzki217> english is fucking dumb dont worry about it
[3:17:48] <MUTILUX> That's why
[3:17:49] <%Ulizez001> english is dumb
[3:17:49] <Dragon_Batman> na Margarita is hard
[3:17:50] <AncelDeLambert> it depends on the root language
[3:17:51] <+SWindleFeD> English is fucked, get to know this
[3:17:51] <DianaTheAscian> English is to complicated for now good reason
[3:17:52] <TrashLeviathan> marge
[3:17:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> English is the best language.
[3:17:55] <Mendin> American English makes no grammatical sense or consistency, deal with it
[3:17:55] <WllmBrandt> "larger"
[3:17:59] <spinalwizard> There are more exceptions than rules\
[3:18:03] <RyuuAoi> Lager?
[3:18:07] <a_mad_dragon> marge simpson
[3:18:07] <worldbrand> that is a good point, because it is margArine, not margErine
[3:18:14] <+Kavtech> Garish.
[3:18:15] <%Ulizez001> @DesuDesuDokiDoki i agree but its also the worst
[3:18:18] <Shastafield> gif
[3:18:23] <%GinAndRoses> gammon
[3:18:23] <RyuuAoi> Language
[3:18:24] <@Menitta> Soft G into A
[3:18:24] <@Solidus_113> garage
[3:18:24] <alexandrecau> MAGA?
[3:18:27] <BonzoBeanMachine> garbage
[3:18:35] <worldbrand> jaraj?
[3:18:39] <Dragon_Batman> To be fair Margarine has one letter after
[3:18:41] <+SWindleFeD> @alexandrecau that's a hard G
[3:18:45] <Chester_goes_Berserk> English beat up all the other languages in an alley and stole their shit
[3:18:47] <+ArcanumArcanum> all of these are hard Gs. People dont know what a hard and soft G are
[3:18:47] <Dragon_Batman> the a I mean
[3:18:49] <veldinmusic> English is dumb
[3:18:49] <TungstenViper> it's not an english word maybe?
[3:18:56] <DianaTheAscian> no hes logic is right the language is just dumb
[3:19:00] <extradopeness> Interchangeable
[3:19:01] <%Ulizez001> pronounce aubergine
[3:19:02] <AMaidIndeed> French Loan words?
[3:19:03] <Djinnazz> G can sound like a G or J depending
[3:19:09] <@Menitta> Its okay, english classes are mostly nonsense
[3:19:09] <NocturnalRites> theres a prayer bead back that way
[3:19:15] <+Idziman> Fun Fact: Margarine is illegal in state prisons in Wisconsin
[3:19:15] <extradopeness> Oh theres an E there
[3:19:15] <Dragon_Batman> Large is closer to what your looking for
[3:19:20] <Djinnazz> ge or ka
[3:19:25] <+Reaper102388> At least we are speaking that ancient and dead language... French
[3:19:34] <+ItsRatman> they both go the same way :(
[3:19:36] <Parapattern> Margarine - Place of origin: France
[3:19:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> The real answer is because the word is from a different language.
[3:19:40] <NocturnalRites> ok Minh lead him to it nevermind
[3:19:41] <alexandrecau> @extradopeness e is there exactly because changable won'T work
[3:19:41] <Djinnazz> Ja*
[3:19:44] <%king_wragles> Stop saying it wrong!
[3:19:46] <AncelDeLambert> I mean... Wisconsin is DRIPPING in butter anyways
[3:19:47] <DianaTheAscian> @Idziman well thats specific
[3:19:59] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:20:09] <Djinnazz> he doesn't see you yet.
[3:20:18] <%KaizenChaos> BONE OUT
[3:20:19] <worldbrand> Anyway, the margarine plastic thing is super fake, but it does contain trans fats
[3:20:22] <+Kavtech> This boss is EZPZ, real fun to fight though.
[3:20:27] <alexandrecau> if the word is from a different language but that language ALSO use a hard g that makes no sense
[3:20:27] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:20:32] <%QueequegTheater> just go for it 4Head
[3:20:35] <hassanico> no centipede for you...
[3:20:41] <RyuuAoi> !uptime
[3:20:41] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 26 minutes
[3:20:47] <0rond> trans fats are human fats
[3:20:52] <Dragon_Batman> He's a little far from a sculpture no?
[3:21:01] <NocturnalRites> You can one shot those guys by jumoing at them like the lizards
[3:21:08] <NocturnalRites> jumping*
[3:21:26] <+MillerLowlife> hell yeah dogtown
[3:21:27] <extradopeness> G and J, C and K, fuck these letters
[3:21:33] <weissguard> So apparently Margarine was first invented in France in 1869?
[3:21:33] <%Ulizez001> imagine an actual dog town
[3:21:39] <worldbrand> Looks like the soft G pronunciation started around 1900, alongside a lot of typographical errors spelling the word "margErine"
[3:21:40] <Dragon_Batman> That would be neat
[3:21:46] <weissguard> Idk if that means anything..
[3:21:47] <@Menitta> The Romans were jerks
[3:21:56] <@Menitta> If Latin is so romantic, how come its dead?
[3:21:58] <RyuuAoi> @woolieversus you need hydration
[3:22:04] <BonzoBeanMachine> Sekiro must defeat the five lords of dogtown.
[3:22:08] <worldbrand> Yeah that's a weird rule huh
[3:22:10] <DianaTheAscian> @Ulizez001 i could see dog shit for miles
[3:22:11] <DracaenaLeaf> No your not
[3:22:11] <%GinAndRoses> or when sounded like "a" as in neighbor and weigh
[3:22:11] <%QueequegTheater> receipt
[3:22:13] <+Reaper102388> Like Ancient
[3:22:14] <@Menitta> WEIRD
[3:22:14] <Parapattern> That's not a hard rule
[3:22:16] <FacetiousAF> that rules a godddamn lie
[3:22:21] <0rond> I before E except C is the biggest lie taught in schools
[3:22:22] <%king_wragles> I before E, except after C.... or when this rule just doesn't fukin apply LUL
[3:22:22] <AncelDeLambert> there are so many exceptions to that memetic that it's useless
[3:22:26] <Patzzki217> that rules sucks because there's so many exceptions for it
[3:22:27] <%QueequegTheater> @Reaper102388 That breaks the rule
[3:22:33] <+Reaper102388> Exactly
[3:22:42] <worldbrand> it's almost like english is a bastard language in which few grammatical rules are universal
[3:22:47] <0rond> someone counted and that "rule" is wrong over 50% of the time
[3:22:47] <Jolly_Adventurer> My english teacher told us that rule was bullshit
[3:22:50] <+ItsRatman> english is dumb because its a conglomeration of a bunch of languages
[3:22:55] <DrBeanie> weird is one of those words
[3:22:59] <extradopeness> Science lol
[3:23:05] <SixthSun2> The problem with modern English is that it's cobbled together from a lot of different languages
[3:23:06] <%Ulizez001> @Nina96 oof
[3:23:06] <+Idziman> I before E, unless tou run a feisty heist on yur weird beige foreign neighbor
[3:23:08] <AncelDeLambert> @WoolieVersus Brian Regan tells the greatest joke about that of all time
[3:23:13] <@Menitta> Its like that one time you use roman numerals in algebra
[3:23:14] <Dragon_Batman> Don't read this woolz- This bout to be rough
[3:23:14] <RyuuAoi> I hate not paying more attention in Spanish class.
[3:23:15] <veldinmusic> English is the bastard language
[3:23:15] <%conflict1914> well its like 3 languages shoved together with a sprinkling of latin on top
[3:23:16] <%DatAsuna> English is a the bethesda game of languages
[3:23:17] <@Menitta> Like why the fuck
[3:23:18] <weissguard> You right Minh. PREACH.
[3:23:19] <%HRDSalami654> That's because it's I before e except after c and when making the a sound.
[3:23:24] <worldbrand> Hahahhaha
[3:23:26] <Storm_Samurai> That rule is BS for words like neighbour, weigh, beige and rein
[3:23:28] <+cvp5127> thats bull
[3:23:30] <weissguard> LUL
[3:23:32] <alexandrecau> here is a bescherelle
[3:23:32] <AncelDeLambert> SANDBAGGED
[3:23:35] <+Noxyba> There are more that don't follow the rule, even
[3:23:37] <0rond> english has more instances of that rule being wrong than it being right
[3:23:38] <+NerevaRising> French is way easier
[3:23:38] <%HRDSalami654> Neighbor makes the a sound.
[3:23:40] <RyuuAoi> English is so BASIC
[3:23:43] <weissguard> Sandbag COUNTER
[3:23:44] <alexandrecau> harder but it makes sense
[3:23:44] <%GinAndRoses> it's a more consistent language
[3:23:45] <+cvp5127> words have genders in french
[3:23:47] <+chaumiester> Says the man who speaks roughly 4 languages
[3:23:47] <DianaTheAscian> woolie with that sandbag
[3:23:50] <%HRDSalami654> again everyone forgets the last part.
[3:23:51] <%superc37> it's a language with rules that might as well not exist
[3:23:52] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie reverses the Sandbagging
[3:23:56] <TheTakkster> Subjunctives
[3:23:56] <NocturnalRites> Yeah that gender shit sucks
[3:24:01] <Dragon_Batman> Spanish has that
[3:24:02] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus did you just assume that lamp's gender????
[3:24:04] <@Menitta> I took two french classes. WHY THE FUCK DOES FRENCH HAVE THAT
[3:24:04] <hassanico> Woolie French is super easy
[3:24:05] <$trueherobappo> If English is your first language, every other language is much harder.
[3:24:05] <Haarute> Spanish is the same, it's so stupid.
[3:24:05] <SixthSun2> Is the gender of an object THAT important?
[3:24:07] <ihavegivenup> i also speak spanish and it has that too
[3:24:11] <+Idziman> why is this table feminine?
[3:24:12] <0rond> english has an absurd amount of exceptions and none defined "rules"
[3:24:12] <worldbrand> german has 3 genders and the gender for the word girl is neutral
[3:24:14] <hassanico> The sun is obviously a guy
[3:24:20] <hassanico> Chairs are obviously women
[3:24:20] <extradopeness> Yeah German has that too i think
[3:24:24] <Jetsfantasy> Learning spanish has taught me that too, but I understand what you mean
[3:24:25] <+nekodelic> welcome to romance languages
[3:24:28] <NocturnalRites> French, Spanish, and italian hve it
[3:24:29] <%Ulizez001> as an american who grew up with parents who only spoke spansih, i know the struggle
[3:24:30] <%QueequegTheater> At least Latin makes it obvious via the endings
[3:24:36] <TheTakkster> English is actually unusual because it doesn't give objects genders
[3:24:38] <Shastafield> NotLikeThis the objects have two genders?
[3:24:40] <@Menitta> WHY IS THE LIBRARY FEMALE
[3:24:42] <RyuuAoi> Actually @woolieversus WE DO. We have to be very careful. There are multiple genders now.
[3:24:42] <NocturnalRites> the whole Romance language bs thing
[3:24:48] <Dragon_Batman> nope just 2 of em
[3:24:48] <worldbrand> No there's just two enemies hahahaha
[3:24:48] <DianaTheAscian> whats the most easy language overall chat?
[3:24:56] <Dragon_Batman> With another behind those
[3:24:57] <worldbrand> esperanto?
[3:24:57] <chromdad> i read her like a boom
[3:24:58] <NocturnalRites> you can sneak around woolie
[3:24:59] <Mendin> 2 there and a third further away
[3:25:01] <chromdad> boom
[3:25:03] <alexandrecau> @Menitta from a French person the rponounciation is fucking jarring if you use the wrong gender. woulde like saying bed instead of was
[3:25:03] <+ItsRatman> spoken chinese is pretty easy
[3:25:07] <chromdad> book even
[3:25:07] <%superc37> Klingon
[3:25:10] <RyuuAoi> @nina96 Spanish
[3:25:11] <extradopeness> Some are NEUTRAL too @Shastafield
[3:25:12] <Sozu_> @Menitta because it hosts the babies
[3:25:12] <%QueequegTheater> sneak up on one when the third one is gone
[3:25:17] <+NiktenKing> @WoolieVersus How about ye olde GAOL
[3:25:23] <0rond> I think simplified korean might be it
[3:25:30] <worldbrand> how about uralic languages though
[3:25:32] <%QueequegTheater> USE WALL EXECUTION
[3:25:32] <%GinAndRoses> another weird gendered language thing, for some reason filipino folks always seem to mix up english pronouns
[3:25:36] <NocturnalRites> You can totally skip these guys by grappling around them
[3:25:41] <worldbrand> which have a single word for third person pronouns like he/she
[3:25:46] <Djinnazz> I before E except after C and when sounding like A as in Neighbor and weigh And on weekends and Holidays and all through May and you'll always be wrong no matter WHAT you say!
[3:26:05] <hassanico> watch him alert...
[3:26:07] <@Menitta> I get using l' for nouns that start with vowels
[3:26:10] <@Menitta> but like
[3:26:11] <%king_wragles> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:26:14] <+nekodelic> @worldbrand uralic is like Hungarian and Finnish?
[3:26:14] <@Menitta> cmon
[3:26:15] <+ItsRatman> NICE coward technique
[3:26:21] <%QueequegTheater> Staggered?
[3:26:28] <0rond> what do you mean library ISN'T female?
[3:26:29] <hassanico> does he
[3:26:35] <hassanico> does he not understand bloodsmoke
[3:26:37] <Dragon_Batman> He back dashed away from it, I don't think it would have worked anyway
[3:26:38] <worldbrand> @nekodelic yeah, and a whole fistful of other offshoot languages from around the same area and eastwards
[3:26:43] <0rond> the fork is male and the spoon is female and the knife is both
[3:26:43] <RyuuAoi> Like a Ninja, Billy!
[3:26:55] <%Ulizez001> @Nina96 google says spanish is the easiest, which makes me feel bad. my spanish isnt great
[3:27:05] <RyuuAoi> Actually a ninja would have marked them all then and there.
[3:27:06] <alexandrecau> je te tues won'T really work
[3:27:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> english is better tho
[3:27:09] <%QueequegTheater> I bet Japan
[3:27:10] <+nekodelic> @worldbrand those sound so cool, ngl
[3:27:11] <+Reaper102388> Couldn't you just... Lie?
[3:27:16] <alexandrecau> but yes sometime it does
[3:27:17] <+EndgameContent> Castlevania vietnamese dub when
[3:27:22] <AncelDeLambert> reading Wuxia and reading all the translation notes about "literally Father The King" and shit is nuts
[3:27:23] <RyuuAoi> *murked
[3:27:24] <worldbrand> yeah i'm terrible at vietnamese and i dont like speaking it around strangers because it requires me to infer a whole lot about our relationship at a glance
[3:27:28] <+nekodelic> written Japanese is absolutely hell
[3:27:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:27:30] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Hoo boy the gendered language rules ain't aging well
[3:27:33] <%QueequegTheater> I bet Japan's language being so regimented influenced the hyper politeness of Japanese culture
[3:27:34] <%Ulizez001> @DesuDesuDokiDoki its boring tho
[3:27:44] <+cvp5127> languages need a patch
[3:27:50] <AncelDeLambert> don't call the cat a female cat. Don't do that!
[3:27:52] <@Menitta> Its so fucking stupid.

[3:28:14] <Djinnazz> Could you now?
[3:28:15] <@Menitta> If Latin was so romantic, how come its dead?!
[3:28:16] <AncelDeLambert> Don't call it a Black Hole
[3:28:18] <hassanico> @AncelDeLambert une chatte?
[3:28:19] <DianaTheAscian> we need to role the update back to Latin or something
[3:28:26] <Shastafield> the sultan of sit
[3:28:30] <%DatAsuna> I made thei mistake of being good at rench in high school and they made me take german as well
[3:28:35] <GoldeNOVA> S I P P
[3:28:35] <0rond> well in hebrew for example the language itself is gendered, there is no way to call something big without gendering it
[3:28:37] <hassanico> The next boss is the best Demons' Souls boss
[3:28:39] <Mendin> smoke and a pancake
[3:28:41] <+nekodelic> @menitta it's romantic because it made a lot of children
[3:28:45] <AncelDeLambert> @hassanico filthy savage!
[3:28:49] <NocturnalRites> ugh screw the next boss
[3:28:51] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Latin was the last good language
[3:28:56] <+Reaper102388> Cigar and a Waffle?
[3:28:58] <0rond> there's no "big", only "male big" and "female big"
[3:28:58] <hassanico> @AncelDeLambert did I just say pussy instead?
[3:28:59] <%QueequegTheater> I chose to take Latin AND Greek in high school because I was stupid
[3:29:03] <NocturnalRites> its not hard just obnoxious
[3:29:04] <RyuuAoi> Latin is dead but it's the base to a lot of languages

[3:32:19] <RyuuAoi> @bapposama Milwaukee Bucks?
[3:32:19] <Dragon_Batman> Especially the fire raven feather
[3:32:25] <a_mad_dragon> the toronto clever girls LUL
[3:32:26] <$trueherobappo> @RyuuAoi Ye ye
[3:32:28] <Storm_Samurai> Toronto WutFace
[3:32:35] <$trueherobappo> @RyuuAoi It's fuckin sick.
[3:32:42] <NocturnalRites> He missed out on Black Hat and the Umbrella
[3:32:45] <Dragon_Batman> You can also go up in the skies
[3:32:48] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> Toronto Tarantula
[3:32:50] <RyuuAoi> @bapposama I can dig it
[3:32:56] <$trueherobappo> @RyuuAoi RIGHT?!
[3:32:57] <+Kavtech> And why would you "go around" the headless?
[3:33:25] <NocturnalRites> I think the upgrades just make it easier to use
[3:33:40] <+buttdirt> @kavtech when he's about to grab your anus
[3:33:51] <Dragon_Batman> You don't eat damage I think
[3:34:17] <worldbrand> @Dragon_boy21 that's a tough one to answer because i'm not even remotely disgusted by bugs. maybe the mibu village people
[3:34:22] <+Kavtech> @buttdirt Understandable, just frustrating that Woolie panic-jumps so much in other contexts.
[3:34:25] <Dragon_Batman> Also you can go above the enemy
[3:34:26] <%QueequegTheater> Chat is evil

[3:34:47] <%Ulizez001> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[3:34:52] <$trueherobappo> Making more Budhas
[3:34:53] <RyuuAoi> Woolie lied in chat!

[3:35:02] <DianaTheAscian> @El_Desperad0 when they say F
[3:35:03] <NocturnalRites> The Sculptor loves his booze so hes spending it on alcohol
[3:35:05] <RyuuAoi> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:35:11] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus What about the Toronto Race Traitors
[3:35:13] <$trueherobappo> salt
[3:35:16] <$trueherobappo> Salt
[3:35:18] <DXLelouch24> its not that kind of immortality Woolie, its just an auto phoenix down
[3:35:20] <$trueherobappo> More salt
[3:35:23] <0rond> this cash is stgraight up the material cost
[3:35:27] <extradopeness> Hey there! @LVDoomien
[3:35:31] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the upgrade tree is dumb
[3:35:32] <0rond> it's not paument
[3:35:35] <hassanico> did he seriously miss the umbrella...
[3:35:36] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You need ALL the requirements for the upgrade you want
[3:35:38] <Zeemod155> They're called prerequisits
[3:35:43] <worldbrand> Twitch chat: there are 516 people guarding 516 doors. One of them tells the truth, one of them lies, the next one tells the truth, the next one lies...
[3:35:49] <hassanico> What's so confusing???
[3:35:50] <NocturnalRites> I'd tell him how to find Black hat but I scuk at directions
[3:36:01] <Dragon_Batman> @WoolieVersus just in case check the box near the undying guy
[3:36:27] <+RaziWraith> People knocking Woolie for missing the smallest vendor in the game though. DansGame
[3:36:36] <+linSP> POCKET CASH
[3:36:49] <Dragon_Batman> Did he even go down that way? I don't remember if he did
[3:36:56] <RyuuAoi> @raziwraith Also for jumping... Kappa
[3:37:07] <DianaTheAscian> coin toss like Jhonny? @WoolieVersus
[3:37:08] <+Reaper102388> Unless it's a cowboy hat... you can keep money toss
[3:37:10] <$trueherobappo> *Dr. Faust*
[3:37:12] <NocturnalRites> I havent seen many of these so thats why Im asking lol
[3:37:30] <Slimeking_Mike> That's DOCTOR to you, mister!
[3:37:33] <+buttdirt> permamently blind foes with coins
[3:37:46] <weissguard> Okay, but what does that Kunai do in Swordmaster?
[3:37:50] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus should probably look up the Iron Fan at this point
[3:37:52] <NocturnalRites> Cause that UMbrella is really damn useful
[3:37:54] <NaturalGear> it uses 2 spirit emblems for shot tho
[3:37:57] <+linSP> being afraid of using an ability which uses your money/precious resource is such a pat mentality

[3:38:44] <$trueherobappo> Anyone wanna see woolie play with hats?
[3:38:49] <extradopeness> CORPULENT PURSE
[3:38:54] <AMaidIndeed> UwU
[3:39:04] <%DatAsuna> I rocked the butterfly kunai, upgraded umbrella and divine escape
[3:39:09] <Dragon_Batman> So he can still get to Black Hat then
[3:39:29] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus there's a merchant in Ashina Castle with one of the last tools
[3:39:31] <+NerevaRising> It's more expensive from the box
[3:39:37] <worldbrand> it gets used so seldom that it would be neat if cliff-lost items also went there
[3:39:39] <+Fenlig> The coin purse weeps in anticipation of a imminent transaction
[3:39:52] <Storm_Samurai> WutFace
[3:40:10] <%DatAsuna> The purse is leaking some precoin you say?
[3:40:15] <$trueherobappo> Okay Hayabusa..
[3:40:29] <%DatAsuna> Hayabusa is in Nioh
[3:40:39] <%DatAsuna> You get the izuna drop from him
[3:40:59] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Mist raven best prosthetic
[3:41:03] <Dragon_Batman> It's more of a range thing it looks like
[3:41:06] <NocturnalRites> I think hes too mobile for it
[3:41:09] <+linSP> the butterflies track better from a distance
[3:41:15] <+NerevaRising> It's really good against bosses
[3:41:20] <%DatAsuna> mist raven is good but I didn't use it much.
[3:41:28] <+reluctant_monkey> Mist raven makes the hit sound, but if you did time it rirght you dont take damage
[3:41:29] <%DatAsuna> just wasn't my style
[3:41:57] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The life of a coin would be pretty sad, imagine exchanging hands and owners for like a thousand times only to find that one owner you really like cause they treat you nice instead of roughly but then you have to eventually part ways with them too
[3:41:57] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:42:07] <%DatAsuna> But ye Jin Hayabusa is one of the hypest duels in Nioh
[3:42:12] <Dragon_Batman> I still say to try the mist raven with real enemies
[3:42:13] <%DatAsuna> and Nioh has a lot of hype dueals
[3:42:24] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Mist raven doesnt use ammo if you dont get hit too
[3:42:33] <BonzoBeanMachine> but is Sonic in Nioh 2 tho?
[3:43:01] <%DatAsuna> probably
[3:43:31] <$trueherobappo> That was a dope boss..
[3:43:35] <NocturnalRites> I suggest Old Grave first Woolie you can buy another tool their
[3:43:38] <Dragon_Batman> You have to spend what you have to get there tho
[3:43:42] <RyuuAoi> Try Headless one mo gain!
