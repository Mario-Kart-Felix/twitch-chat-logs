Fun Fact of the Month: Lion Tamers use chairs to tame lions with because the brain of a lion is hardwired to focus on one thing to attack at a time, so the four prongs of a chair being thrust at it just freak it out.

[0:18:51] <derap41> Time to destroy heaven
[0:18:52] <+konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus As a heads up in this game, if you've ever read any of Ito's work, then you may be mentally ready to see what this is. Unless you're like me, then you'd be desensitized to everything.
[0:18:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> database, database, living in the database WOAAOAA
[0:18:56] <+R_BChe> Doom Crossing
[0:18:56] <+aishman> Also Woolie, thanks to you and Super Eyepatch Wolf, I got Granblue Fantasy VS on the PS4. Ladiva is love.
[0:18:57] <%supersugoisenpai1> supersugoisenpai1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! So I decided to try a fighting game for the first time in years, and picked up GBF versus. I've certainly been taking my lumps as I learn how to fighting game, but I am enjoying it. Love playing as Zeta. Looking forward to some Doom Crossing this week.
[0:19:06] <+kapcommunist> Woolies hot

[0:19:26] <+AMagicalFlute> Yo I want that anime
[0:19:27] <+SuperKirby24> surreee LUL
[0:19:28] <Prevot> SAIDO CHESUTO
[0:19:30] <+robobeau> This is a good time to get into Ring Fit

[0:20:23] <honeyman18> woolieOMG_BE cursed
[0:20:23] <+AMagicalFlute> woolie vs reading
[0:20:27] <andrei11dr> I think Kirby should be switch yo yellow, because yellow means fear for some reason @woolieversus
[0:20:35] <+Reaverund> Ive been trying to program from home with Twitch in the background for the last week. It's kind of unproductive lol.
[0:20:36] <+konekoryugamine> I got nothing
[0:20:37] <+D00msDayDan> excuse me did he just say passover
[0:20:37] <+lethallunacyx> World of Horror? sweet
[0:20:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie vs literacy
[0:20:42] <+jiggy_snipe> lol Jenova
[0:20:43] <+konekoryugamine> Yep, World of Horror
[0:20:50] <%tearfuldevil> MENORA, JEHOVA
[0:20:56] <%Javaa01> Woolie vs 20/20 vision
[0:20:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> use a desk chair
[0:20:58] <honeyman18> Dreamcatcher and Beeswax cremes
[0:20:59] <blazedauron> so who else works in the food industry and is scared about not having a paycheck once your restaurant closes
[0:21:02] <PleasantLeech> yellow means fear because it's the easiest color for our eye to notice
[0:21:02] <%Ecchigun> do not play the spider god , just reset LUL
[0:21:09] <BoneofMalkav> Jenovah, Menora, Dora Dora, MUDA...
[0:21:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:21:17] <%tearfuldevil> ay
[0:21:22] <stachystat> All I did was say this meal is good enough for Jehova!
[0:21:36] <%tearfuldevil> punchmom makingg references that woolie doesn't get for once
[0:21:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> just do what kiryu would do, PUNCH THAT CAT IN THE HEAD
[0:21:43] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus menorahs are for hanuka, not passover
[0:21:49] <+RenoDeGeneric> Think of the SYMBOLISM
[0:22:05] <Artoo_The_Me> Trianglent
[0:22:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Use a table with knives superglued on it
[0:22:22] <Reverend_Roscoe> granblue on pc or ps4?
[0:22:22] <breadprices> the ultimate lion-fighting weapon would be a chair with blades instead of legs
[0:22:24] <DesDavis> Granblue is a good starter fighter
[0:22:31] <gsoto83> Animal Eternal : Doom Crossing
[0:22:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> play to learn
[0:22:35] <%RaidenKyrielight> granblue is my favourite fighting game right now
[0:22:37] <+konekoryugamine> Which in Japanese is 恐怖の世界
[0:22:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Get that escapist catharsis. Elder Gods are infinitely more punchable than a pandemic, or global warming, or the erosion of democracy by late stage capitalism. Give me a 13 dimensional being that can eat time itself any day. I can at least pretend to swing at it with my tiny mortal hands.
[0:22:51] <%RaidenKyrielight> It's not overly complicated and easy to understand
[0:22:53] <+konekoryugamine> "Kyoufu no sekai"
[0:22:53] <nothuzad> also dlc characters are dropping in fast for GB VS
[0:23:01] <+konekoryugamine> For once my Japanese knowledge pays off
[0:23:22] <waffleandman> this game is surprisingly simple
[0:23:28] <TigerClaws12> use it at the same time
[0:23:31] <Prevot> big shits for big boys
[0:23:32] <%StaceMcGate> Is KOTOR 2 LP on hiatus?
[0:23:34] <matsukaze20> Race to the bathroom
[0:23:34] <PleasantLeech> time for big piss action
[0:23:35] <MaxXtreme23> @konekoryugamine hilariously one of the reviews for the game pointed out that the japanese stuff in the game is mostly nonsense
[0:23:36] <nothuzad> brafrum
[0:23:38] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah unless you get the worst elder god doom note
[0:23:38] <+ClericOfSparda> streamer man!
[0:23:40] <%RaidenKyrielight> i was expecting massive 30 hit combos and endless pressure
[0:23:43] <+konekoryugamine> It is.
[0:23:45] <%Scarnehu> go to BRB
[0:23:47] <+konekoryugamine> It super is, most of the time.
[0:23:50] <+konekoryugamine> But the typos are prominent
[0:23:56] <lloyddboy> You stay. I go. No following.
[0:24:02] <MaxXtreme23> i laughed when i got hit by "Insmasu Syndrome"
[0:24:02] <+konekoryugamine> And the Kuchisaki onna is a thing that does appear
[0:24:05] <+konekoryugamine> So yay
[0:24:15] <judgefudge9> Big pp
[0:24:19] <@Commando_Joe> enjoy your pee woolie
[0:24:23] <honeyman18> Wash Hands
[0:24:30] <stachystat> Good luck punch-mom
[0:24:39] <+konekoryugamine> Also, don't do the thing that will make you insane.
[0:24:48] <MaxXtreme23> but a lot of things make you insane
[0:24:54] <+konekoryugamine> That makes you lose your reason and increases Doom
[0:25:00] <%The_Timo> I just got a news update about Quebec having a bunch more cases today
[0:25:01] <+R_BChe> the animal villagers are infected FeelsBadMan
[0:25:03] <gsoto83> PUNCH MOM is Prime canadiate from So.Serv
[0:25:06] <mMayrro> when's mahvvel tho Kappa
[0:25:11] <+RenoDeGeneric> @Commando_Joe Man what stream aren't you a mod in? Saw you in Octopimp's chat the other night
[0:25:12] <+kapcommunist> playing AC on the 3DS?
[0:25:15] <derap41> Yeah but its for 2-3 months
[0:25:17] <@Commando_Joe> >_>
[0:25:23] <primaryfire> lots of people are having classes from home now though
[0:25:28] <nothuzad> RenoDeGeneric none :)
[0:25:29] <Agami23> social services must have it rough right now
[0:25:31] <%Ecchigun> everyone is banned to work
[0:25:34] <%RaidenKyrielight> couple months
[0:25:36] <QaizerArt> Are you having a good time with the extra time off?
[0:25:39] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus hey punchmom, is woolie a Monty Python virgin? Has he not seen/heard the good shit
[0:25:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Too big to dodge
[0:25:51] <+gustavozxd> my classes aren't cancelled but they allowed people to not go, my dad is 67 so I got worried and decided not to go
[0:25:59] <Artoo_The_Me> Hit box too many frames
[0:26:02] <Prevot> punchmom's hair looking just like Resident Evil 3 Jill
[0:26:03] <+DesertPenguin> Sucks working in a grocery store though
[0:26:04] <42nfl19> I am also telecommuting for work. Hope you don't get stiry crazy.
[0:26:05] <19DarkKnight87> I work in a call center, so we're not closing
[0:26:12] <derap41> Bored of reddit better open reddot
[0:26:36] <@Commando_Joe> You're getting hit with the MMO/Mobile Game pressure
[0:26:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> I thought she was talking about real life
[0:26:39] <+gustavozxd> LUL
[0:26:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:26:42] <%optimasmaximas> not getting re-elected smh
[0:26:42] <+jiggy_snipe> ugh I hate when games feel like an obligation lol
[0:26:46] <%Theycallmenerf> My dad has always been a huge Doom fan and he never got into Doom 2016, I introduced him to it and he has Doom Eternal Day in his Calendar. If you need to binge a game with self isolation, I recommend Doom 2016 and when Doom Eternal comes out. Also happy Saint Patrick's Day!

[0:37:58] <voodoolawyer> When is Punch Mom playing MAHVEL
[0:38:02] <+konekoryugamine> Pat did it
[0:38:04] <+konekoryugamine> Ask him
[0:38:04] <derap41> Dark Souls Though
[0:38:11] <%ozzrabbit> If it makes you feel any better, and you need a backup plan, why not try Monkey Island? It’s simple, and not scary at all. A decent introduction for all intents and purposes.
[0:38:13] <+konekoryugamine> Ask Pat what his thing was that helped him stream it.
[0:38:16] <blackkanye> I have a lot of weird shit eiwth my elgatos
[0:38:17] <%Parapattern> woolieREMEMBERS psaHoldon
[0:38:25] <+Jaysky> Mood
