[0:37:21] <Saltmeisterr> but bullets can
[0:37:37] <%dds333a> @bluphoenixxv kinda, just simpler. I'm not good at describing it
[0:37:41] <Man_in_the_Red> 3 charges of Paper and Scissors
[0:37:56] <%dds333a> They both look good, but this one has higher "fidelity", if that's the wors
[0:38:02] <%dds333a> *word
[0:38:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:06] <Equirah> jump slash doesn't seem confortable to do if you have to keep holding jump
[0:38:35] <bluphoenixxv> does dash have invincibility frames from all attacks or just bullets
[0:38:45] <Saltmeisterr> @bluphoenixxv only shoots
[0:38:47] <rubyk_darkbridger> @WoolieVersus each character has their own gimmicks worth looking at
[0:38:48] <Man_in_the_Red> when are we getting money matches of this
[0:39:02] <%dds333a> like, bamboo stages like this were in the original
[0:39:04] <Saltmeisterr> @bluphoenixxv sry only swords

[0:39:57] <%Juriasu> oh yeah that

[0:47:39] <%dds333a> 4

[0:47:54] <Equirah> @Saltmeisterr does minit man die if no one kills him in 1 minute? LUL

[0:48:14] <Equirah> YOOOOOO LUL
[0:48:30] <Saltmeisterr> Minh is Otomo
[0:48:31] <Saltmeisterr> uh
[0:48:32] <StreamingInVain> @SamuraiGunn2 I believe Woolz is Hayao, and Minh is Otomo
[0:48:33] <Equirah> everyone go buy this game LUL
[0:48:42] <YellowAfterlife> you may also juggle your leftover swords as Minit
[0:48:45] <%livlinn> Hayao means Fast Boi woolieYE
[0:48:46] <bluphoenixxv> Hayao do
[0:48:46] <Saltmeisterr> and regg is ghost
[0:48:46] <SamuraiGunn2> thx!
[0:48:53] <%dds333a> That battle
[0:48:53] <Prevot> nice
[0:49:04] <SamuraiGunn2> best review so far: "dog go fast"
[0:49:10] <Man_in_the_Red> not quite Buddy from Lisa the joyful but i'll take it
[0:49:14] <%xeromage> it IS ridiculous... because you all have guns and don't have to go into the death pit
[0:49:22] <Saltmeisterr> so the invis actually has decent counterplay
[0:49:34] <Saltmeisterr> cuz all light sources reveal it
[0:49:35] <%dds333a> Minh with the firewalls
[0:49:45] <Saltmeisterr> even from bullets
[0:49:58] <bluphoenixxv> neat
[0:50:11] <Saltmeisterr> also ghost has a floaty jump
[0:50:24] <r0dneyjenkins> yo this stage reminds me of Cave Story
[0:50:42] <MihajloMBlood> Oh the right camera is amazing
[0:50:49] <SamuraiGunn2> @r0dneyjenkins that's some strong praise
[0:50:49] <%dds333a> @r0dneyjenkins real talk. the colors, even a bit of the rock texture
[0:51:07] <Saltmeisterr> actually are the lighting effects off?
[0:51:19] <r0dneyjenkins> @SamuraiGunn2 you deserve it
[0:51:25] <SamuraiGunn2> oh man
[0:51:31] <SamuraiGunn2> this might be an old build
[0:51:35] <SamuraiGunn2> oh nvm
[0:51:36] <r0dneyjenkins> @dds333a exactly what I was thinking
[0:51:39] <SamuraiGunn2> there's the God Rays
[0:51:42] <Saltmeisterr> no there they are
[0:51:49] <Saltmeisterr> THE RAYS
[0:52:09] <%teefpal> what is this game?
[0:52:12] <%xeromage> only Minh has learned how to shoot down
[0:52:15] <%dds333a> the flame bullets affect the lighting inside the head too, good shit
[0:52:33] <lc_cl7> is there a "Final Destination" map ?
[0:52:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:52:38] <lc_cl7> if you know what i mean
[0:53:01] <bluphoenixxv> !MOTIVATED
[0:53:01] <@Moobot> @bluphoenixxv 2268 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:53:05] <Saltmeisterr> PULL is kinda like the FD map of samurai gunn
[0:53:05] <lc_cl7> big dick 1v1 maps
[0:53:16] <Saltmeisterr> but its not in yet
[0:53:23] <r0dneyjenkins> !MOTIVATED
[0:53:24] <DontChuckle98> Seeing half of Minh’s face close to the camera’s making me crack up more than I should. Lol
[0:53:27] <%dds333a> Decisive
[0:53:32] <+silentnarga> Hayao can run up walls
[0:53:33] <Saltmeisterr> check the manual
[0:53:39] <%teefpal> @DontChuckle98 its great
[0:54:08] <lc_cl7> Minh literally in reggies head
[0:54:10] <%ja07sj> they write it on the side of the cabinet
[0:54:23] <%xeromage> invisible BULLETS!?
[0:54:28] <Saltmeisterr> Otomo also has a speed boost
[0:54:29] <%dds333a> @lc_cl7 taking up his space, eating his food
[0:54:47] <Saltmeisterr> after respawn or beheading an opponent
[0:54:55] <bluphoenixxv> this map is awesome
[0:55:15] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:55:41] <%dds333a> Yo, that invisibility SeemsGood
[0:56:23] <bluphoenixxv> I have even notice ghost going invisible which I guess is the point
[0:56:43] <Saltmeisterr> banger remix on this stage
[0:56:51] <Saltmeisterr> catJAM
[0:56:51] <Man_in_the_Red> so uh Dev, you wanna speak with devolver about one Zero
[0:57:19] <dmtjinni> Is this the first time the entire gang Woolz, Regge and Minh appear together on stream since covie started?
[0:57:24] <Man_in_the_Red> or would that have too much overlap as a crossover
[0:57:26] <lc_cl7> Minh is so good
[0:57:27] <Saltmeisterr> @Man_in_the_Red oh the devs are very much aware of people' requests for zero
[0:57:43] <SamuraiGunn2> it might be request #1
[0:57:45] <SamuraiGunn2> haha
[0:57:51] <SamuraiGunn2> we want lots of friends characters
[0:57:52] <lc_cl7> GO TEAM MINH
[0:58:08] <DSD24> I'm going GHOST
[0:58:21] <r0dneyjenkins> Yo Zero would be awesome for this
[0:58:24] <NotHereToStream> long active frames
[0:58:26] <%diegobandzz> Lol wait like minit, minit
[0:58:39] <SamuraiGunn2> I want Zero from MegaMan
[0:58:47] <%diegobandzz> Lmao that’s amazing
[0:59:01] <Myriades> is this spelunky? triSip
[0:59:14] <bluphoenixxv> alright good people ima head out
[0:59:16] <Man_in_the_Red> i'll hazard a guess and say capcom wouldnt answer the phone on that one
[0:59:17] <%dds333a> @samuraigunn2 X or Z? Kappa
[0:59:40] <SamuraiGunn2> x is classic but z is anime
[0:59:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[0:59:42] <SamuraiGunn2> i can't decide
[0:59:56] <dmtjinni> just pressing buttons at random LUL
[1:00:04] <stanlychicken> zx is the answer
[1:00:09] <Man_in_the_Red> just to spare the animators making his green nips on every animation go Inti Creates
[1:00:18] <lc_cl7> omg minit gimmick is fucking awesome
[1:00:21] <Jathspuh> PogChamp
[1:00:26] <SamuraiGunn2> @Man_in_the_Red lol
[1:00:28] <iacus_> Minit should die after 60 secs no?
[1:00:29] <r0dneyjenkins> @SamuraiGunn2 Zero from Rockman you mean. Also Zero should have Sky Waltz
[1:00:39] <SamuraiGunn2> watch out for slug on showdowns
[1:00:43] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus Reggie u NEED read up on Slug's movelist. he has many tools.
[1:00:43] <SamuraiGunn2> he's a rule breaker
[1:00:45] <SamuraiGunn2> haha
[1:00:47] <YellowAfterlife> Minit does die after 60s but you don't usually last 60s
[1:00:49] <SamuraiGunn2> only slug brings his
[1:00:52] <%dds333a> LUL
[1:00:55] <das_sensentier> Yo I forgot this game existed
[1:01:00] <Man_in_the_Red> no, no, Zero from borderlands
[1:01:01] <iacus_> Oh that's awesome
[1:01:19] <+TheEvilOmega> Hey, Woolie, have you considered doing an LP of Skies of Arcadia: Legends, the third best RPG on the GameCube? I think it will tick all the Woolie will like this boxes.
[1:01:30] <Man_in_the_Red> or drakengard 3
[1:01:33] <SamuraiGunn2> other people can pick up Slug's kunais to get more ammo too
[1:01:49] <lc_cl7> haha this is a good idea for a stage
[1:02:02] <Saltmeisterr> Slug also has a fastfall, wall and ceiling cling, angled bullets, and angled reflects
[1:02:12] <r0dneyjenkins> bullet tennis
[1:02:30] <Saltmeisterr> MINH RIGHT
[1:02:33] <lc_cl7> @samuraigunn2 deflect me hanics?

[1:51:05] <Saltmeisterr> @SamuraiGunn2 streams on TWITCH
[1:51:06] <%dds333a> I WILL ASCEND
[1:51:18] <Prevot> reggie is easy to get back in LUL
[1:51:30] <+mechslayer71> this is what DragonBall fans consider hype huh? BuddhaBar
[1:51:32] <glass_marcus> ayyy
[1:51:33] <%illtima> Check out ODDTAXI
[1:51:34] <%hax_metatron> Maybe Reggie can watch HxH and talk to us about it
[1:51:35] <%dds333a> The Warriors
[1:51:41] <%dds333a> back up back up
[1:51:45] <+mechslayer71> has Reggie watched Avatar?
[1:51:58] <Dopamien> hells kitchen PogChamp
[1:52:02] <%dds333a> The Warriors is a goddamn masterpiece, and it bears little mentioning
[1:52:08] <%Lion_kun> Reading the haikyuu manga
[1:52:28] <%dds333a> Thunderball Kappa
[1:52:29] <%Juriasu> most of the golden eye nostalgia comes from the game I think
[1:52:34] <PanicSwytch> Dr. No is my favorite Bond film
[1:52:47] <@Menitta> I'm a big fan of Casino Royale
[1:52:49] <iacus_> Yes
[1:52:56] <%dds333a> Oh, yesssss
[1:52:57] <%Lion_kun> The Daniel Craig one or the Niven one?
[1:53:00] <masterfire23> I love that sequence
[1:53:17] <%illtima> There was a scene like that in Johnny English 2
[1:53:19] <@Menitta> Quantum is not good
[1:53:19] <%Lion_kun> My favorite CR scene is the torture scene
[1:53:22] <%Juriasu> skyfall is fucking great solace is shit
[1:53:25] <@Menitta> skyfall is awesome
[1:53:28] <PanicSwytch> Quantum is meh
[1:53:30] <%dds333a> Skyfall is much better than QoS
[1:53:37] <iacus_> Quantum gets better on second viewing, but suffers from a lack of a clear villain
[1:53:37] <%Lion_kun> Skyfall is overrated
[1:53:47] <%dds333a> Yes
[1:53:48] <iacus_> I didn't like Skyfall that much tbh
[1:53:48] <%Lion_kun> But at least it's not Spectre lol
[1:54:04] <%dds333a> Classic Bond is episodic, like the novels
[1:54:09] <%Lion_kun> Spectre is so bad
[1:54:12] <%dds333a> absolutely
[1:54:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Casino Royale is probably my favorite bond movie
[1:54:35] <%Lion_kun> CR is easily the best Craig film
[1:54:38] <@Menitta> i wish Pierce Brosnan was in better movies. He's my favorite bond
[1:55:00] <%Juriasu> @Menitta you don't like Mama Mia Kappa

[2:05:52] <%perfectsalami> switcher huh. that brings back memories
[2:05:53] <+PenmanLupine> Samurai Gunn 2 is looking really weird
[2:05:55] <%dds333a> "So This Is Returnal".
[2:06:07] <Solidnick18> yep
[2:06:08] <$eco419> ;o
[2:06:18] <%andrewofbob> And 3-zone runs can get LONG
[2:06:18] <leith_aziz> I actually know very little about this game. Interested in what makes the game so good
[2:06:20] <%derap41> Minh got a good gag going don't overdo it
[2:06:29] <majindusto> They Won't
[2:06:32] <leith_aziz> (since I don't own a PS5)
[2:06:35] <@Menitta> Not necessarily. if you find new weapons and such they carry over
[2:06:37] <1miklu> hey put the cb mode on for minh!
[2:06:39] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[2:06:46] <Johannen> No Colorblind mode)
[2:06:53] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz really! no way.
[2:06:55] <@Menitta> I beat this game and it's like no. 3 on my top 10.
[2:07:00] <@Menitta> it's so good
[2:07:03] <%Lion_kun> Same
[2:07:07] <+kullumanati> So why play? Ummmmmm
[2:07:08] <%X2Eliah> @Johannen ye, Minh isn't playing
[2:07:15] <Ziegsy> Whats yer other top ten?
[2:07:20] <+fetrigon> LUL

[2:07:25] <@Menitta> Ratchet and Guilty Gear
[2:07:27] <%ekodrop> returnal to samurai gunn 2
[2:07:28] <stevenellis386> yeyeyeye good luck wooly and crew
[2:07:30] <leith_aziz> In a galaxy far far away....
[2:07:35] <%dds333a> It didn't start with a wipe. so it cant be SW
[2:07:35] <%emperordread> Reggie Souls episode 2
[2:07:42] <drunken_lemur> It's really, really big
[2:07:45] <vstpnv> god when's metroid prime 4 tho
[2:07:47] <+fetrigon> rivet looks different...
[2:07:50] <morningmoondude> Samurai Gunn 2 looks so good
[2:07:51] <Ziegsy> ratchet was amazing
[2:08:10] <@Menitta> also there is some hard progress the farther you get in so not all is lost
[2:08:16] <%Lion_kun> AAA roguelike
[2:08:19] <iacus_> yeah this game is almost the same as Rogue
[2:08:24] <majindusto> Metroid Prime 4 will be so Hype
[2:08:26] <%andrewofbob> Never played a roguelike? prepare to die a lot
[2:08:30] <iacus_> Looks great
[2:08:32] <%dds333a> @iacus_ yeah. nearly identical
[2:08:35] <Johannen> Easier to do a rogue like in "2d"
[2:08:39] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Does the twitch game name matter? for me it still lists Samurai Gunn 2 just saying
[2:08:45] <+mechslayer71> was Reggie there for hades? or was it Minh? I think it was reggie
[2:08:52] <+fetrigon> is Metroid prime 4 still in development?
[2:09:00] <iacus_> oh no, got hit by the Returnal
[2:09:04] <stevenellis386> although this game has everything I want to expect for a new metroid.
[2:09:04] <Prevot> oh no she's gonna crash and lose all her powerups
[2:09:07] <%dds333a> @fetrigon yes. ideally. hopefully
[2:09:08] <drunken_lemur> They managed to hide it being a Rogue like pretty early on
[2:09:09] <%X2Eliah> well game over
[2:09:09] <Saltmeisterr> hey
[2:09:13] <Hericknhx> that means she's the protagonist PogChmap
[2:09:21] <majindusto> Still Samurai Gunn 2 for me too
[2:09:21] <stevenellis386> except the roguelike theme tho
[2:09:29] <Saltmeisterr> i returned after reporting my mission
[2:09:32] <mrblitzstream> @mechslayer71 yeah, it was reggie
[2:09:34] <%dds333a> She's gonna get hit by an energy bolt and start over Kappa
[2:09:36] <Saltmeisterr> and i brought food!
[2:09:40] <%andrewofbob> It nicely weaves the story around the roguelike structure
[2:09:54] <+kullumanati> If only for the save. Damn Housemaque. Could’ve been better. Can’t wait til that issue is fixed.
[2:09:56] <+mechslayer71> @mrblitzstream yeah I thought so
[2:09:58] <Johannen> Wasnt it like advertised as a GroundHog day The game? It was prety obvious somethign rogish was affot
[2:10:05] <%dds333a> Not doing too hot
[2:10:08] <@Menitta> god I'm so excited to get to a certain point in this game
[2:10:10] <%derap41> game over
[2:10:10] <%Lion_kun> The ending of this game was not what I was expecting but I dug it.
[2:10:22] <%derap41> And That's How my story Ended
[2:10:23] <vstpnv> @woolieversus game name is still Samurai Gunn 2 btw
[2:10:23] <+Selectamo> oh hey! I just beat this game!
[2:10:26] <%dds333a> @johannen yes
[2:10:26] <@Menitta> I wanna see their reactions. very excited
[2:10:33] <+Selectamo> This was great fun
[2:10:35] <%Lion_kun> The sun did not make it indeed.
[2:10:39] <Indigo_Automaton> That rotating collar on her suit is rad
[2:10:40] <majindusto> Game name fixed
[2:10:46] <@Menitta> oh the rumble is great
[2:10:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:10:49] <scrumbotime> oh the rumble is buckwild
[2:10:49] <Saltmeisterr> damn look at that fooliage
[2:11:03] <Ziegsy> Woolie is wrong. the best is astros playhouse
[2:11:11] <@Menitta> it does a better job than Ratchet I'd say
[2:11:12] <%Lion_kun> Best PS5 games are this, demons and ratchet
[2:11:18] <%andrewofbob> Astro's Playroom was the tech demo; Returnal is the gold standard.
[2:11:18] <majindusto> Play it Woolie
[2:11:19] <Johannen> Cant wait for the new game from Arcane Studios, Deathloop sound cool as heck with a similar premise
[2:11:20] <%Lion_kun> And Astro
[2:11:20] <%dds333a> @saltmeisterr I think you mean "foilage".
[2:11:23] <@Menitta> oh yeah Astro does a good job
[2:11:28] <leith_aziz> @Lion_kun Demon Souls? That was thiis year?
[2:11:39] <%Lion_kun> Best PS5 games I meant
[2:11:39] <Hericknhx> *there's not alot of PS5 games tbh*
[2:11:46] <%Lion_kun> That uses the ps5 well
[2:11:48] <PanicSwytch> So if progress resets on every run, does anything carry over?
[2:11:51] <%X2Eliah> There's not a lot of PS5s tbh
[2:11:51] <Prevot> too bad they will soon stop using it at all, like they always do with features like this
[2:12:05] <iacus_> those topographical effects are always cool

[2:13:01] <%dds333a> @dickiewoodsmall_279 I hate it when they play the thing at all
[2:13:02] <Indigo_Automaton> It's a lot like Death Stranding's scan too

[2:13:19] <iacus_> lucky to crash so close to a ruins site
[2:13:19] <@Menitta> this game doesn't really do a lot new but it really comes together for an insanely unique experience
[2:13:25] <%andrewofbob> Oh, it gets a bit more anime later
[2:13:28] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @dds333a I hate when young people
[2:13:31] <Hericknhx> I mean, she has two colors eyes KEKW
[2:13:33] <Prevot> after the Metroid series re-establishes itself with Dread and Prime 4 I'd like to see them try a 3rd person shooter like this

[2:15:43] <stevenellis386> the drriiiiiiiiiift
[2:15:44] <Prevot> why are modern controller so shit
[2:15:46] <DickieWoodsmall_279> time to crack it open and scrub it with a toothbrush
[2:15:49] <NotHereToStream> now thats gonna fuck up your guilty gear experience too
[2:15:49] <yukichocomilk> wtf
[2:15:49] <%livlinn> daaamn OhMyDog
[2:15:52] <linSP> Sony’s controllers were always short lived
[2:15:54] <%andrewofbob> QA powers extend into peripherals
[2:15:55] <%derap41> Premium condoles
[2:15:55] <Pookiedaexzile> CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
[2:15:57] <%dds333a> @iacus_ happens a lot with sticks, where they have spots where movement doesn't register, or locks
[2:15:57] <auraofdawn> man why does everything with a joystick so messed up these days
[2:16:08] <leith_aziz> My DS4 controller D-poad breaks so often
[2:16:14] <+black_pariah> try some compressed air, maybe? would that fix it?
[2:16:15] <Indigo_Automaton> The Index also has deadzone issue from the sticks wearing out
[2:16:15] <linSP> My rumble on my ps5 controller is busted, the noise is loud af
[2:16:16] <stevenellis386> idk ive never had this problem with my controller fortunately
[2:16:16] <leith_aziz> I've gotten like my 4th one now
[2:16:18] <%derap41> That's what 60-80 bucks to the wind
[2:16:18] <+polothegreatest> time to learn to solder electronics
[2:16:23] <%ekodrop> probably still under warranty
[2:16:25] <@Menitta> Microsoft has that for the Elite controllers iirc
[2:16:31] <%livlinn> does q-tip and contact spray fix this as well?
[2:16:36] <%ekodrop> get yo money back
[2:16:38] <kingbreaker21> @auraofdawn You mean like all of us guys? :P JK
[2:16:39] <%Irridium> My PS5 d-pad is fucked. Left button registers as up half the time.
[2:16:42] <%Lion_kun> Buy 2, break one, buy one.
[2:16:46] <%Irridium> makes strive real fun I can tell you that
[2:16:51] <%dds333a> My GC controller's wire is frayed to shit, but everything on it still works fine, but joystick drift is a rather common problem
[2:17:00] <leith_aziz> @Irridium I hear the PS5 D-pad is kinda iffy
[2:17:00] <Johannen> I was hoping that drift issue was not as big of a deal. Fock me then
[2:17:00] <SilverFaustX> the ps4 dpad has that also, left is up.
[2:17:13] <leith_aziz> @Irridium For FG's at least
[2:17:14] <%xeromage> Imagine how many times a day someone has a problem on console that would be fixable on PC
[2:17:23] <mrblitzstream> @WoolieVersus use your Arcade stick LUL LUL
[2:17:36] <Hericknhx> need some BattleBeavers FeelsBadMan
[2:17:43] <%Lion_kun> Under warranty?
[2:17:44] <Pookiedaexzile> CUTTING EDGE
[2:17:52] <%dds333a> Start to Appliance Error
[2:17:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[2:17:52] <+polothegreatest> mario party 2 was the death of controllers
[2:17:54] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:17:57] <%Irridium> @leith_aziz it's not great
[2:18:02] <%andrewofbob> It's a risk of going in on the first production run
[2:18:10] <%Irridium> all that rumble and speakers and motion babey
[2:18:14] <dylheim93> 70€
[2:18:14] <stevenellis386> controllers are too expensive now
[2:18:16] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if only these controllers were made with better materials or more games had kb+m support on console or you could tweak stick settings in software or any other of the hundreds of possible solutions
[2:18:32] <stevenellis386> 90$ CAD
[2:18:38] <%derap41> "fixed"
[2:18:41] <Hericknhx> legit, once I get some money I'll buy 3 BattleBeaves just so I don't have to deal with controllers
[2:18:45] <Pookiedaexzile> If only you could use any controller you wanted...or even a keyboard
[2:19:16] <fengxii> REGGIE
[2:19:20] <DSD24> Its a dead person dressed like me!
[2:19:25] <iacus_> Just started the game and you've already died?
[2:19:28] <@Menitta> It such a double Edge sword. the controller tech is fantastic but they're expensive as hell and break easily.
[2:19:30] <%Broand> oh minhs here! minh has come to see us! hooray
[2:19:32] <%dds333a> My other three GC controllers are fucked, tho LUL
[2:19:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Space Glock
[2:19:41] <Indigo_Automaton> Nice gun
[2:19:51] <DickieWoodsmall_279> trust no one, not even yourself
[2:19:55] <%derap41> You've created a time Paradox!
[2:19:56] <auraofdawn> its fine
[2:20:00] <%andrewofbob> "I die; it happens"
[2:20:00] <%dds333a> Shit happens
[2:20:01] <%livlinn> PrideShrug
[2:20:12] <cipher758> typical tuesdays
[2:20:14] <Johannen> This remind me about Venture Bros
[2:20:18] <%andrewofbob> It's kinda my thing
[2:20:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Spizzy Glizzy
[2:20:20] <@Menitta> [sees your own dead body] Oh no! Anyway
[2:20:23] <+Selectamo> haha I ran through this area, and then forgot completely about the switch mechanic
[2:20:35] <Hericknhx> "Oh man it's myself dead on the ground... Anyway"
[2:20:39] <+Selectamo> so I just wondered why some chests were locked behind doors
[2:20:51] <iacus_> so far not a lot of identification game in this roguelike
[2:20:51] <%dds333a> clearly
[2:21:01] <@Menitta> you get used to it fast
[2:21:12] <%dds333a> To be fair, that was pretty easy to tell
[2:21:15] <masterfire23> detective mode perma on
[2:21:24] <mrblitzstream> look at this pseed boi... zooom! Thats how the character runs xD
[2:21:31] <iacus_> wow.
[2:21:31] <%dds333a> cool, too
[2:21:32] <mrblitzstream> *speed
[2:21:37] <iacus_> abusing the scan pulse
[2:21:43] <brunoberserk> NEW GUNJUMPER
[2:21:43] <%Juriasu> puppers are here
[2:21:46] <+FuqBoiSlim> no pretty only shoot
[2:21:49] <%dds333a> Reg moving like Control LUL
[2:21:50] <Johannen> This is gonna get tiresome with the siezure inducing pulses
[2:21:50] <Hericknhx> DOGGIES PogChamp
[2:21:53] <%LastHazzerd> if i want to look at pretty i'll watch a movie
[2:21:56] <Prevot> hey it's the aliens from Edge of Tomorrow
[2:22:13] <%derap41> Nier did it betta
[2:22:13] <@Menitta> I was gonna say Edge of Tomorrow yeah
[2:22:20] <%dds333a> @prevot what about it's much better title Kappa
[2:22:35] <Pookiedaexzile> One fine day with a woof and a purr A baby was born and it caused a little stir No blue buzzard, no three-eyed frog Just a feline, canine little catdog Catdog Catdog
[2:22:36] <Hericknhx> oh I see, the murder boner
[2:22:39] <%LastHazzerd> that's surprisingly appropriate source
[2:22:41] <Prevot> the one that could apply to this game also? LUL
[2:22:42] <mrblitzstream> All you need is kill vibes
[2:22:42] <Hericknhx> good mechanic
[2:23:01] <%dds333a> @prevot indeed LUL LUL
[2:23:25] <iacus_> "rearranging themselves like... tilesets on a procedural game!"
[2:23:39] <%dds333a> Really nice of yourself to leave recordings
[2:23:46] <Hericknhx> it's like a cycle... that makes us do the returnal monkaS
[2:23:59] <%dds333a> Just general logging, like Annihilation
[2:24:11] <brunoberserk> oh no she is stuck in the IZANAMI
[2:24:14] <%derap41> If a system is good steal it
[2:24:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Minh knows whats up
[2:24:24] <%dds333a> there it is
[2:24:25] <@Menitta> oh yeah that's an amazing reload system
[2:24:26] <%andrewofbob> I hate the pistol because I'll spam the trigger then reload too early
[2:24:35] <@Menitta> it works so well especially with some buffs
[2:24:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Active Reload the clip, put some sauce on it
[2:24:41] <Johannen> Pls, my eyes are burning
[2:24:46] <iacus_> I've seen this in an anime
[2:24:56] <Hericknhx> touch the glowing tentacles
[2:24:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:25:00] <%dds333a> Beautiful bioluminescence
[2:25:01] <Prevot> active reload 🤝 action commands
[2:25:03] <Hericknhx> they'll give power
[2:25:11] <tomikaze_> only the statues with glowing eyes
[2:25:18] <%derap41> the fuck are those bullets
[2:25:19] <Johannen> Please ask Reggie to cool on the scans, kinda hurts
[2:25:20] <%dds333a> At least I assume "bio" LUL
[2:25:26] <iacus_> I think reggie is blind. up the brightess so he doesn't have to pulse every 2 seconds
[2:25:27] <%nabby1> who is playing?
[2:25:34] <%derap41> Reggie
[2:25:36] <%dds333a> Reg

[2:25:47] <SamuraiGunn2> 24 raiders from SamuraiGunn2 have joined! 
[2:25:47] <%nabby1> i mean.....oh no!
[2:25:52] <Saltmeisterr> aye we raidin
[2:25:56] <%derap41> Wait the ancient greek penis herb?
[2:26:02] <%dds333a> He sent people LUL
[2:26:03] <Saltmeisterr> stickem up
[2:26:15] <+fetrigon> LUL
[2:26:23] <%dds333a> He brought out the goons
[2:26:29] <%nabby1> nabby1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[2:26:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Shout out the gang Woolie
[2:26:35] <%derap41> yeah Silphium is an extinct penis hardener
[2:26:43] <brunoberserk> CHOZO ?
[2:26:44] <%derap41> Romans ate it all
[2:26:49] <%andrewofbob> BLORB
[2:26:56] <Saltmeisterr> woolie never looks at chat :(
[2:27:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Overhuman
[2:27:22] <+fetrigon> they're doing an LP rn soooo...
[2:27:39] <gespenstkick> Chat has also been rather backseaty and spoilerish the last few streams
[2:27:41] <Saltmeisterr> i know lol
[2:27:53] <%derap41> Chat only got itself to blame
[2:27:54] <Saltmeisterr> i joke
[2:28:12] <Saltmeisterr> shame about chat being dumb tho
[2:28:18] <%derap41> Woolie and Reggie should work on a buddy system where one filters chat for the other
[2:28:25] <@Menitta> Aw what'd I miss
[2:28:28] <Deasmeister> I rebound it so I could spam it more
[2:28:29] <%dds333a> speak for yourself, only chat is dumb Kappa
[2:28:36] <+fetrigon> @saltmeisterr oh yeah I wasn't talking to you. Just anyone who might not understand.
[2:28:48] <%derap41> Binding of Isaac is the official passtime of Canada thanks to a Bald Eggman
[2:28:51] <Johannen> After Incredibles 2 how are these devs made such a siezure inducing scan is beyond me
[2:29:02] <+fetrigon> Minh
[2:29:08] <%dds333a> Risk and reward, baby
[2:29:09] <%andrewofbob> And sometimes you just don't get a malfunction
[2:29:11] <%ekodrop> what's your malfunction
[2:29:24] <@Menitta> oh the malfunctions are super not worth it
[2:29:26] <%andrewofbob> There are some perks that reward getting and fixing malfunctions
[2:29:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Its an augment that might have a malfunction
[2:29:30] <%derap41> Buff and Debuff
[2:29:32] <%ertwou> ertwou subscribed with Prime. 
[2:29:33] <%Broand> double the minh
[2:29:35] <%Lion_kun> They're never worth it
[2:29:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Trade offs
[2:29:36] <@Menitta> at least imo
[2:29:45] <%derap41> and some Debuffs can be good with right synergies
[2:29:57] <%derap41> Predator cannon
[2:29:59] <%andrewofbob> A malfunction on it's own sucks, but you gained something for the risk
[2:30:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Melee Build wen
[2:30:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ORB
[2:30:06] <%Dapper_Cactuar> there are also some cool builds you can do manipulating malfunctions
[2:30:09] <iacus_> event horizon shit
[2:30:12] <%dds333a> The Predator laser scouter
[2:30:13] <+fetrigon> its pat
[2:30:16] <Hericknhx> is that Pat dark form
[2:30:16] <DSD24> Nice reference Reggie
[2:30:20] <+black_pariah> I love that woolie ignores chat for the sake of the YT upload and Pat absolutely does not give a shit. That's them in a nutshell
[2:30:21] <gespenstkick> Retinal scan? Nah m8 gimme one of them Reginald scans
[2:30:30] <%derap41> Nah that's the orb from Astartes
[2:30:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Not Xenos
[2:30:34] <%dds333a> alternatively, that robot in Fallen Order
[2:30:36] <Pookiedaexzile> anything but xenos
[2:30:44] <iacus_> pat doesn't do yt, I think
[2:30:47] <+TheIndigoLlama> I really, REALLY love how H.R. Giger this game is
[2:30:50] <@Menitta> Sometimes they're like "get .01 less seconds of reload speed but get stabbed every time you enter a Lowes"
[2:30:57] <Pookiedaexzile> All Pat Does is Youtube Now
[2:31:06] <Pookiedaexzile> :)
[2:31:08] <%dds333a> @iacus_ he all but abandoned it, he uploads the VODs, and that's it
[2:31:12] <+black_pariah> @Pookiedaexzile oof

[2:34:03] <+fetrigon> @pookiedaexzile thanks shivers
[2:34:16] <Hericknhx> I remember when I saw the triler that started with the corridor and door my heart skipped a bit
[2:34:21] <%dds333a> Hit so hard you started remembering what you ate for breakfast that morning
[2:34:23] <DSD24> Wingdings?
[2:34:24] <Dannzzyy> This game is tight.
[2:34:27] <Hericknhx> but then it was Retirnal
[2:34:28] <+black_pariah> @gespenstkick where's hellboy when you need him
[2:34:30] <Hericknhx> still cool
[2:35:05] <Hericknhx> lmao

[2:35:13] <%dds333a> Reggie got it too LUL
[2:35:38] <%dds333a> Oh. I can see those dreams getting tight later
[2:35:41] <Hericknhx> Woolie is really a kuudere most of the times huh Kappa
[2:36:04] <TWOxACROSS> When you are walking out of the ship, you can hold X to skip the animation to get back into it quicker
[2:36:05] <%dds333a> Back in it
[2:36:14] <@Menitta> I'm excited for Reggie to get to the point of "I got hit once near the start. RESTART RUN"
[2:36:14] <gespenstkick> The cycle, AKA the loop
[2:36:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Clean ya Damn ship
[2:36:34] <%dds333a> And then the Dragon God kills you
[2:36:36] <Hericknhx> there's have to be a video of a person beating the game in first try
[2:36:36] <%derap41> Such a bad name
[2:36:41] <Talen99> Is ThIs A RoGuElIkE?
[2:36:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Do it perfect first try
[2:36:52] <iacus_> All You Need is Kill is the superior title
[2:36:55] <sushahana> you want any kill?
[2:37:05] <@Menitta> God the manga was so good
[2:37:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Kill is on the Menu
[2:37:06] <%derap41> Hey kids....want some Kill?
[2:37:17] <%livlinn> I prefer the original ending
[2:37:20] <Pookiedaexzile> I can't believe its not Kill
[2:37:21] <Hericknhx> Edge of Tomorrow was cool
[2:37:27] <Hericknhx> I like that movie
[2:37:30] <%dds333a> Play it enough, and you will get it down
[2:37:36] <+skylerpilot> yeah, I got through the first half of the game without dying
[2:37:41] <@Menitta> Edge of Tomorrow was good yeah but that manga was fire
[2:37:42] <%derap41> @Hericknhx Yeah Tom Cruise is still a creep Scientologist though
[2:37:46] <%dds333a> entire structures will eventially become knowable
[2:37:48] <+skylerpilot> the first time
[2:38:00] <@Menitta> I'd like to read the book at some point
[2:38:02] <iacus_> true roguelikes are very random, you win by developing tactics for every possible situation. That's probably not viable for realtime procedural games
[2:38:03] <Hericknhx> @derap41 don't worry about it
[2:38:03] <+black_pariah> the frank grillo one?
[2:38:15] <%dds333a> @derap41 eh, great actor tho
[2:38:17] <masterfire23> I think it's on hulu too
[2:38:27] <iacus_> looks like a demon
[2:38:28] <DSD24> This hole was made for me?
[2:38:29] <Mundkipz> ya frank grillo
[2:38:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Tom Cruise is more of a Movie star than an actor
[2:38:56] <%dds333a> @pookiedaexzile is there a difference Kappa
[2:38:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:03] <%derap41> @dds333a Sure but there are a lot of great actors
[2:39:04] <gespenstkick> @Pookiedaexzile I like that wording a lot
[2:39:24] <%andrewofbob> tbh, ether has a cap and two uses: unlocks, and being a cheapskate with the difficulty

[2:42:49] <DedlokPM> Definitely timestop. psaWhat
[2:42:51] <scrumbotime> i was lucky enough to get a ps5 so i can confirm, the feedback with this game was just on a degree that is almost ridiculous
[2:42:56] <+fetrigon> needs timestop

[2:46:02] <Johannen> Agression based on color, eh?
[2:46:09] <Hydrapissed> well I mean we assuming we the good guy now lol
[2:46:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Reggie Cripping confirmed
[2:46:14] <+fetrigon> MrDestructoid tell me what to believe
[2:46:19] <TWOxACROSS> you only get one weapon
[2:46:21] <Deasmeister> you dont
[2:46:26] <scrumbotime> lol, what "change" weapon
[2:46:27] <%andrewofbob> Change weapons by standing over a weapon
[2:46:38] <usurper_sos> you only have one weapon
[2:46:57] <%derap41> not always an equal trade
[2:47:24] <%dds333a> homing
[2:47:40] <%andrewofbob> Secondary is a lightning attack; hold it
[2:47:44] <Deasmeister> hold alt fire
[2:48:00] <%andrewofbob> The carbine is auto, so hold that too
[2:48:12] <Johannen> Chonk
[2:48:12] <+Otsgekee> Damn I want ps5 for this
[2:48:33] <%dds333a> That's a neat name
[2:48:59] <TWOxACROSS> man, bummed that I finished the game right around when they added showing items on the map. Before you just had to remember something was in another room
[2:49:31] <%dds333a> side dashin
[2:49:37] <%andrewofbob> They thankfully changed the colour of ethers on the map; they used to be red
[2:49:49] <+Meathands> It restores your MP
[2:49:55] <TWOxACROSS> so many QoL changes made
[2:49:59] <PMda2nd> use the ether in beef
[2:50:10] <+Meathands> Or to freebase cocaine
[2:50:20] <TWOxACROSS> triangles are items
[2:50:39] <TWOxACROSS> obolite chunks, consumables, stuff like that
[2:51:04] <%dds333a> Still living? cmonBruh
[2:52:27] <%derap41> gonna be honest the stream compression is making the screen just a big smear
[2:52:28] <scrumbotime> why do i get the feeling that he is halfway holding down the right trigger
[2:52:37] <Johannen> You mean like in God of War?
[2:52:47] <iacus_> OwOlites
[2:53:03] <%dds333a> as is the standard

[2:53:30] <%dds333a> shmups where you have to upgrade for points to go to you is a bit of a hassle
[2:54:00] <+xpakeo> did they ever add some sort of save to this game?
[2:54:11] <%andrewofbob> The level system really drags out runs if you intend to win
[2:54:46] <TWOxACROSS> LOL
[2:54:49] <Johannen> But when are you gonna get a timestop?
[2:55:14] <Indigo_Automaton> Those look cool
[2:55:16] <TWOxACROSS> they are kinda slow to react, so if you move quick, you're still good

[2:57:32] <%Lion_kun> I never used those
[2:57:45] <TWOxACROSS> damaged ones are random
[2:57:50] <TWOxACROSS> normal ones cost money

[3:00:52] <Rahvith> Wasn't she sent here specifically to test this kinda shit tho?
[3:01:12] <TWOxACROSS> not specifically to test, but explore
[3:01:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Not on herself....I don't think
[3:01:23] <Pookiedaexzile> That would be a shitty job

[3:02:53] <TWOxACROSS> Because you can fix those
[3:03:10] <%Lion_kun> there is a malfunction that damages you on drops
[3:03:12] <Pookiedaexzile> That spheres pretty good, hope nothing happens to it
[3:04:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie known xenophile down to be infected by xeno virus weapons
[3:04:50] <Pookiedaexzile> *Weapons of mass destruction
[3:05:02] <DSD24> @Pookiedaexzile He did sell out during the XCOM playthough for a jetpack
[3:05:24] <Pookiedaexzile> But now he's putting the jetpack on the inside
[3:05:26] <Meltgar> OH DAMN i missed GUN 2
[3:06:12] <%Lion_kun> THAT IS GOOOOOOOD
[3:06:16] <%Lion_kun> SAVE UP FOR THE LEECH
[3:06:34] <%andrewofbob> Leech will help so much against mobs
[3:06:35] <zzNamttamzz> Leech is OP
[3:06:48] <Johannen> Wait...you leave your proficency with the weapon?
[3:06:49] <%andrewofbob> Bosses, more of a one time event
[3:06:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Leech will make you live
[3:07:09] <%Lion_kun> at level 5 adrenaline, it's 10% per hit
[3:07:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:07:11] <%andrewofbob> @Johannen Proficiancy improves the guns you find
[3:07:11] <DSD24> Life steal builds are fun
[3:07:19] <%Lion_kun> they nerfed it in the patch from 25% and it's still OP
[3:07:22] <Rahvith> Life steal is op in any game LUL
[3:07:54] <Johannen> @andrewofbob Woolie said when you find a new gun you leave that behind when disscusion proficency
[3:08:00] <TheHeroAppears> they balance life steal pretty good in hades
[3:08:01] <%andrewofbob> And then there's the lifesteal perk on the carbine...
[3:08:14] <%dds333a> @rahvith Leech and Life Drain sucks in SMT, but Drain in Devil Survivor is OP LUL
[3:08:45] <Johannen> That's just like in Tomb Raider
[3:09:06] <Pookiedaexzile> If the designers know: Life Drain sucks If the Designers don't know : Life Drain breaks the game
[3:09:13] <%andrewofbob> @Johannen If you dump your level 0 starter pistol on the floor and get 4 levels, your starter pistol remains at level 0
[3:09:30] <%dds333a> @pookiedaexzile truth LUL
[3:09:42] <Johannen> @andrewofbob So it is tied to a weapon and not a character? That kinda dumb
[3:09:44] <%dds333a> beautiful
[3:09:48] <TWOxACROSS> Proficiency on a weapon is for learning the traits on that weapon type when you find them later
[3:09:49] <%Lion_kun> groot teleports
[3:09:56] <DSD24> Zero Shift lets go
[3:10:10] <%andrewofbob> @Johannen Yeah, character levels affect stat rolls when weapons drop
[3:10:19] <TWOxACROSS> Proficiency for the player increases the potency of the weapons you pick up
[3:10:26] <%dds333a> Plant-Man has you in his sights
[3:10:37] <Pookiedaexzile> The sound track isn't displaying the need for Doom like movement
[3:10:58] <%dds333a> Nearly didn't make it LUL
[3:10:58] <Pookiedaexzile> You need to be ripping AND tearing Reggie
[3:11:21] <%Lion_kun> staying close to groot helps, he doesn't use those long range attacks
[3:11:33] <%dds333a> oh hey

[3:12:11] <%andrewofbob> How long until the stagger system gets explained
[3:12:23] <DSD24> Selene seems like a surgical knife rather then ripping and tearing like Doom Slayer
[3:12:31] <%dds333a> This could be your new thang
[3:12:31] <iacus_> these don't look randomized
[3:12:51] <@Menitta> The spit mall can be amazing
[3:12:55] <TWOxACROSS> @andrewofbob oh right I forget if they ever explain it
[3:13:06] <TWOxACROSS> Theerrrre's the stagger mechanics
[3:13:13] <%dds333a> Blasted
[3:13:17] <DSD24> He gave it his best shot
[3:13:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Surgical Rip and Finesse Tear

[3:15:11] <%andrewofbob> @Talen99 Except for the ones that revive you, I would think
[3:15:12] <DSD24> Is Selene gonna get a biomechanical suit at the end of this? she's shoving all the parasites on her
[3:15:24] <%andrewofbob> "Would you like this debuff or death?"
[3:15:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Body Horror Samus by the end of the run
[3:15:32] <%dds333a> @dsd24 Selene becomes the Guyver
[3:15:42] <%dds333a> or Zeiram
[3:15:50] <Johannen> Is Samus is even a human by the end of her adventures?
[3:15:52] <TWOxACROSS> Ooo ooo I'm RETURNING~
[3:15:53] <DSD24> @dds333a THat's exactly who I was thinking of

[3:17:01] <%andrewofbob> Backtracking is how I get 6-hour clears

[3:30:03] <%Lion_kun> need melee
[3:30:11] <%Lion_kun> DO NOT WASTE IT
[3:30:20] <%Lion_kun> you wasted it

[3:33:08] <%Lion_kun> now start again
[3:33:14] <rReizs> oh reggie is on the sticks
[3:33:16] <TWOxACROSS> BUT YOU'VE LEARNED SO MUCH
[3:33:21] <KeiganOfAstora> They should trade off every time they die
[3:33:26] <%dds333a> Man-Thing wins again
[3:33:28] <+beansoup> lol i joined as soon as the run ended. This is on me guys i'm sorry
[3:33:32] <Medo3G> Returnaled
[3:33:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LET'S GO MINH
[3:33:39] <KeiganOfAstora> Nice I like that they're trading off
[3:33:44] <%dds333a> @beansoup LUL
[3:33:50] <%andrewofbob> How could you, @beansoup ?
[3:34:03] <Johannen> Another SOMA hole?
[3:34:20] <TWOxACROSS> lol Minh right in Reggie's camera
[3:34:45] <%athuramn> it adds a special touch
[3:35:04] <+covo375> the rumble in the new ratchet is really good too
[3:35:09] <%andrewofbob> Room 1 death?
[3:35:12] <TWOxACROSS> notice how that hole is punching inward~
[3:35:29] <TWOxACROSS> Taking naps on the ship is basically worthless now :/
[3:35:32] <rReizs> naps were nerfed right
[3:35:37] <TWOxACROSS> You get like 10 integrity
[3:35:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:35:37] <rReizs> because max was abusing them
[3:35:47] <%Lion_kun> no manual reloading
[3:35:55] <%andrewofbob> Reload when you want is "just wait"
[3:35:57] <+covo375> nope, time based or active reload on empty
[3:36:00] <TWOxACROSS> Ammo slowly recharges when not in use
[3:36:03] <Mundkipz> it auto reloads back to full
[3:36:18] <SilverFaustX> theres auto reload
[3:36:32] <%Lion_kun> is Minh holding the fire buton>
[3:36:39] <%Lion_kun> Is Minh holding the fire button?
[3:37:10] <+beansoup> my introduction was Hades i was late on the rogue-like/lite train
[3:37:32] <Indigo_Automaton> Enter the Gungeon is also excellent
[3:37:35] <%andrewofbob> The satisfaction in beating roguelike is because you master the game, not necessarily because you we given power over time
[3:37:43] <%dds333a> More traditional Roguelikes and Lites can be extremely different yeah. TGGW is good about that
[3:38:00] <+tempestzephyr> oh right lol
[3:38:31] <TWOxACROSS> oh the bloodstain mechanic
[3:38:33] <Johannen> @dds333a TTGW?
[3:39:20] <TWOxACROSS> The scout corpse mechanic was bugged for most of my playtime, so I didn't start finding them until I had finished the story and was going for the platinum
[3:39:51] <%dds333a> @The Ground Gives Way
[3:40:05] <%dds333a> @johannen
[3:40:05] <%LastHazzerd> OKAY, i turned of flux and now can see the game much better
[3:40:07] <+beansoup> @TWOxACROSS yeah same here. Finished the story and never saw it once.
[3:40:23] <%dds333a> That also reminds me of Crypt, which is also pretty different between runs
[3:40:44] <%dds333a> except for 1-1
[3:41:12] <laguerrilha> How is the game for minh who has color blindness? is he able to handle it?
[3:41:33] <TWOxACROSS> TIme for D A S H
[3:41:36] <%dds333a> Thankfully there's a Colorblind mode
[3:41:36] <%andrewofbob> Just i-frame through it
[3:41:57] <TWOxACROSS> it's like an LMG
[3:41:58] <%athuramn> this makes the color palette slightly more interesting
[3:42:05] <%LastHazzerd> i do enjoy seeing what colorblind mode does in various games
[3:42:07] <+skylerpilot> Hollowseeker is amazing
[3:42:08] <laguerrilha> i am glad more games now days have color blind mode.
[3:42:12] <%Lion_kun> wait how did Minh get the holowseeker?
[3:42:18] <%dds333a> @athuramn I feel ya LUL
[3:42:23] <%Lion_kun> I thought you had to be in the second biome to get it.
[3:42:26] <+beansoup> i think when i played hollowseeker was the "meta" but i really, really liked the carbine
[3:42:35] <TWOxACROSS> guess they changed it
[3:42:55] <%andrewofbob> For me it's heal-carbine or slug-spitmaw
[3:42:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[3:42:59] <TWOxACROSS> @beansoup yeah, hollowseeker got me through a lot, but i loved getting a carbine with Hardened and Lifeleech
[3:43:07] <laguerrilha> also would like if games had a "no fast flashing lights" for people with seizures
[3:43:08] <KahnWick> Minh's face in the Reggie cam lol
[3:43:09] <%Lion_kun> early hollowseeker is pretty bad but becomes god tier when you unlock the upgrades
[3:43:42] <%LastHazzerd> flyer stuck
[3:43:46] <TWOxACROSS> i have cheesed so many rooms with the phasing rounds lol
[3:43:53] <%LastHazzerd> this looks like alien
[3:43:56] <laguerrilha> lot of games have a lot of light effects going on and this makes so many people with seizures cant play nothing
[3:44:06] <%dds333a> @lasthazzerd I CAN'T MOVE MAN
[3:44:09] <sleepy_pixels> Reggie! look out behind you"
[3:44:09] <kingofjibs> YO that Min dual cam action
[3:44:42] <PortableBoredom> God, Minh being on two cameras is goofy
[3:45:03] <kingofjibs> I think it's part of that dokapon bounus he got
[3:45:09] <%athuramn> it's like video calling grandparents @portableboredom
[3:45:09] <+skylerpilot> no, not permanent. For the run
[3:45:11] <%SomeAsianDood> not permanently
[3:45:18] <TWOxACROSS> If you pick up health when at max, it'll go towards pips to increase your max
[3:45:28] <PortableBoredom> If Minh isn't on two cameras, everyone should be asking "Where's Minh?"
[3:45:35] <TWOxACROSS> lol
[3:45:38] <%dds333a> @kingofjibs The Dokage is too powerful to be contained to one screen.
[3:45:50] <+beansoup> can we put a mirror behind woolie for a third shot of minh?
[3:45:54] <%andrewofbob> Collect a parasite
[3:46:33] <TWOxACROSS> parasites don't count towards malfunctions that cause criticals
[3:46:50] <Djinnazz> Score!
[3:46:53] <%dds333a> welp
[3:47:07] <%dds333a> For real, Reggie LUL

[3:48:40] <%dds333a> More lore
[3:48:45] <Mundkipz> health potions you pick up at full health counts as a resin

[3:49:08] <%LastHazzerd> cuz you kept pointing it out
[3:49:09] <%derap41> color blind looks better sometimes

[3:49:56] <%livlinn> !uptime
[3:49:57] <Mundkipz> you just need to find the key hole to shoot
[3:49:57] <@Moobot> @livlinn WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 11 minutes
[3:49:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:50:01] <laguerrilha> this looks such a fun Metroid game, shame it isnt on PC
[3:50:05] <TWOxACROSS> yeah gates always have a switch to unlock it nearby
[3:50:15] <%dds333a> avoid
[3:50:35] <%dds333a> unless it's a game where you want to STAY in the light
[3:50:41] <TWOxACROSS> no that's Ether
[3:50:46] <%dds333a> so it's not completely ubiquitious
[3:50:47] <laguerrilha> Alan Wake?
[3:50:48] <TWOxACROSS> the purple with gold flakes
[3:51:01] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha exactly
[3:51:21] <laguerrilha> you can shoot the statue too so it closes it eye a little
[3:51:21] <%dds333a> *ubiquitous
[3:51:25] <Djinnazz> 2 keys\
[3:51:25] <rReizs> 2 keys
[3:51:40] <Mundkipz> the blindness is real
[3:51:48] <Djinnazz> HP
[3:51:54] <Deasmeister> hp
[3:51:56] <Talen99> Have they been switching off periodically? That's fun I think they should do it more.
[3:51:56] <rReizs> resin is hp boost
[3:52:05] <iacus_> how can it be cheating
[3:52:22] <TWOxACROSS> specifically, Resin is the HP Up
[3:52:39] <laguerrilha> nice speed run strat
[3:52:40] <TWOxACROSS> Slphium is just what'll replenish HP
[3:52:47] <%andrewofbob> Time to gamble
[3:52:50] <Brandon__Brando> lamo this cam
[3:52:51] <%dds333a> Oh, here we gi
[3:52:57] <%dds333a> *gi

[3:53:06] <%dds333a> fuck me, you know
[3:53:09] <TWOxACROSS> lol
[3:53:26] <rReizs> go for another chest first
[3:53:34] <heartlesshealer> equipment
[3:53:46] <Djinnazz> equipment
[3:54:30] <rReizs> ether is the first one
[3:54:35] <Deasmeister> top
[3:55:19] <%andrewofbob> Use the translocation sphere now
[3:55:19] <TWOxACROSS> god i love the meaty sounds in this game
[3:55:28] <Johannen> One slot? Then why there are 3 slots ?
[3:55:31] <heartlesshealer> transform projectiles or random teleport
[3:55:46] <%dds333a> come back, and see what happens
[3:55:48] <TWOxACROSS> that'll take you to a secret room, and will bring you right back when you're done
[3:55:56] <%andrewofbob> The "somewhere" is an extra area
[3:56:04] <TWOxACROSS> no
[3:56:08] <laguerrilha> no
[3:56:08] <+skylerpilot> no its a secret room
[3:56:11] <AncelDeLambert> sounds like a great way to teleport into shit
[3:56:13] <%SomeAsianDood> no
[3:56:15] <heartlesshealer> medium idea
[3:56:21] <laguerrilha> you might fight harder stuff
[3:56:21] <TWOxACROSS> lol
[3:56:27] <heartlesshealer> :)
[3:56:28] <Brandon__Brando> gamble
[3:56:29] <Hydrapissed> LET EM GABMLE LOL
[3:56:29] <%dds333a> Do it, why not LUL
[3:56:29] <iacus_> the malfunction mechanic is pretty cool
[3:56:31] <Hydrapissed> do it MID BOSS lol
[3:56:34] <TWOxACROSS> it's not an escape item, basically
[3:56:36] <%andrewofbob> Random next room, or random extra room?
[3:56:36] <%LastHazzerd> you're not playing CORRECTLY
[3:56:36] <%livlinn> woolieYE
[3:56:38] <iacus_> i like that you can get rid of it by playing well
[3:56:39] <gespenstkick> Minh playstyle colliding lol
[3:56:40] <Johannen> Backseat Woolie grumble)
[3:56:41] <AncelDeLambert> it's a roguelike, take opportunities to get shit
[3:56:44] <%dds333a> I predict you will NOT be able to use it that way LUL
[3:56:51] <heartlesshealer> it makes sense, but so does woolie
[3:56:55] <iacus_> Woolies strategy makes more sense
[3:56:55] <%dds333a> MONEY
[3:57:06] <%livlinn> psaRaffle woolieMINHMAX
[3:57:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:57:16] <Mundkipz> Content woolie !!!
[3:57:22] <%dds333a> It sure would LUL LUL
[3:57:26] <+tempestzephyr> I mean if it's a really bad situation, how much worse could it get/
[3:57:32] <heartlesshealer> and you drop into the same room you escaped from anyway
[3:57:36] <TWOxACROSS> lol true
[3:57:39] <Hydrapissed> ming gambling hes saftey into the Unknown place lol
[3:57:45] <Hydrapissed> coulda been a lava room
[3:58:29] <heartlesshealer> change bullets into money
[3:58:31] <Hydrapissed> bullets to money
[3:58:43] <TWOxACROSS> good for when a boss does a bullet hell
[3:58:55] <%dds333a> The Danmaku Bomb classic
[3:58:56] <AncelDeLambert> every time Minh leans forward, Reggie's camera looks like a Warcraft Ogre Mage
[3:59:48] <%SomeAsianDood> which one would be the caster? @AncelDeLambert
[3:59:55] <TWOxACROSS> they leave themselves WIDE open when they are aiming with the laser
[4:00:03] <%andrewofbob> Next week: Heroes of the Storm, featuring Cho'Gall
[4:00:29] <Hydrapissed> melee
[4:00:50] <heartlesshealer> :)
[4:01:10] <laguerrilha> LUL
[4:01:57] <Mundkipz> no, you need to get closer
[4:02:08] <Rahvith> That gun is nuts
[4:02:08] <heartlesshealer> active mode
[4:02:12] <TWOxACROSS> no if you're using sighted aiming with a full L2 press, it highlights enemies and their weak points
[4:02:56] <heartlesshealer> money to health, wow

[4:02:59] <TheHeroAppears> minh being in reggie's cam breaks the illusion of minh being elevated on a very high chair
[4:03:22] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AncelDeLambert
[4:04:16] <%dds333a> Bullet Time, hell yeah
[4:04:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:04:19] <TWOxACROSS> it's sadly not as good as other bullet times :c
[4:04:24] <TheHeroAppears> 10 jojo seconds
[4:04:47] <laguerrilha> this run?
[4:05:03] <Djinnazz> no
[4:05:05] <Deasmeister> No for the run
[4:05:16] <%andrewofbob> Weapon in hands is static
[4:05:34] <TWOxACROSS> weapon proficiency is the white meter at the bottom
[4:05:45] <TWOxACROSS> it determines how good the weapons you pick up will be
[4:05:55] <%dds333a> of course
[4:06:22] <Johannen> Some Eldritch shit
[4:06:36] <%dds333a> Love how the translation is getting there
[4:06:43] <TheHeroAppears> octodad has awakened
[4:06:51] <%hax_metatron> Have they talked about controller haptics in this game? Best of all time?
[4:07:03] <%livlinn> Squid1 Squid3 Squid4
[4:07:13] <+BigBruthaThunda> careful brudda
[4:07:25] <+skylerpilot> the actual story to this game is incredibly dark
[4:07:31] <%dds333a> God, that's fucking awful
[4:07:42] <%dds333a> And the fez thing was a huge debacle
[4:08:01] <reonome> how far in is woolie
[4:08:19] <%dds333a> Seems like Woolz himself finished it
[4:08:37] <laguerrilha> Hyper Light Drifter had a secret language, but it gave you roseta stones, not the translation. people had to decode it
[4:08:37] <%dds333a> The other two are going through it
[4:08:38] <%andrewofbob> You should be killing up close to not lose money, anyway
[4:08:54] <iacus_> @hax_metatron yeah they praised the haptics
[4:09:24] <Rahvith> money<life dont @ me
[4:09:57] <%dds333a> Parasyte is pretty alright yeah. The manga lacks a bit of meaningful character development, but it's alright Kappa
[4:10:01] <TWOxACROSS> but less healing :p
[4:10:18] <laguerrilha> dont need more life if you dont get hit
[4:10:27] <%andrewofbob> @Rahvith It's true; dying with a huge stack of obolites sucks
[4:10:38] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha the DMC meta
[4:10:40] <rReizs> weapon proficiency basically increases the rarity of your weapon drops
[4:11:31] <Rahvith> Lore PogChamp

[4:15:09] <%dds333a> @dukenux Yeah, I was getting Aliens, and Prometheus. but I didn't want to say it LUL
[4:15:28] <%andrewofbob> It's scary how conflict invites desperate innovation, WWII is why computers were invented, which are the ancestors to games consoles
[4:15:31] <laguerrilha> getting a PS5 its the first game i want to get
[4:15:31] <%dds333a> moreso the latter, really
[4:15:54] <%dukenux> @dds333a oh no, it's obviously inspired by Ridley Scott. the giant alien holograms are especially like Prometheus thing
[4:16:13] <+Jorm_Plays> whos playing min?
[4:16:14] <%dds333a> @dukenux indeed
[4:16:23] <%dds333a> @jorm_plays ye

[4:19:52] <+Bogart4321> darnabit
[4:19:53] <%LastHazzerd> wow, calling Minh a cripple
[4:20:07] <heartlesshealer> minh, engrave new color changes into your memory
[4:20:15] <%xeromage> There are lots of colorblind people who probably appreciate Minh testing that aspect for them
[4:20:16] <%LastHazzerd> Weeeeeee
[4:20:27] <%andrewofbob> SLUG SHOT
[4:20:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it looks pretty good still with this setting
[4:20:57] <rReizs> everyone likes the hollowseeker
[4:20:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> "homing shotgun" is a word combo I am a fan of though
[4:21:00] <@Menitta> yeah keep the hollowseeker
[4:21:01] <%dds333a> @xeromage oh, absolutely
[4:21:08] <rReizs> but then ELECTROPYLON DRIVER
[4:21:22] <@Menitta> Although the Hollowseeker gets really good later on
[4:21:33] <laguerrilha> yeah this game is great to watch
[4:21:35] <%dds333a> Neither did Reggie LUL
[4:21:43] <%andrewofbob> I just can't get along with the Dreadbound; I miss 3 shots and the gun spurns me
[4:21:48] <heartlesshealer> a ladder that hurts you
[4:21:49] <Mundkipz> you can ride them up like elevators
[4:21:56] <%dds333a> although you're both getting it
[4:21:58] <gespenstkick> Not knowing what to do is the most fun part of a lot of videogames
[4:22:01] <%LastHazzerd> how the turn tables. yeah it's fun to watch folk play this game

[4:23:09] <TWOxACROSS> there's usually something midway through the drop
[4:23:18] <Mundkipz> three blind mice
[4:23:37] <%dds333a> @mundkipz with six sets of eyes Kappa
[4:24:06] <TWOxACROSS> it's kinda easy to miss
[4:24:07] <Mundkipz> too many eyes
[4:24:11] <TWOxACROSS> the map is like your one hint
[4:24:13] <%andrewofbob> Woolie drops down for style points with the hero landing LUL
[4:24:30] <TWOxACROSS> it's a hole in the wall, you'll have to airdash in while falling
[4:24:33] <Rahvith> 2 Hindsight eyes>6 mortal eyes
[4:24:45] <%dds333a> @mundkipz according to the God of War LP, it's accurate

[4:26:22] <%andrewofbob> Red Queen is a sadist, making them dance before pulling the trump card
[4:26:24] <Djinnazz> it was the best thing from that whole franchise.
[4:26:27] <laguerrilha> Why get the Rock if you are not even getting a monster to kill him?
[4:26:35] <%dukenux> i didn't know you could turn into a forest sprite in this game
[4:26:58] <%dukenux> sleep on the creepy rock altar
[4:27:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> you got SLIMED
[4:27:04] <%dukenux> ...Major Tom?
[4:27:04] <laguerrilha> whait no wrong one, it was another famous actor
[4:27:45] <%andrewofbob> Buzz Aldran is chasing you to punch you in the face
[4:27:51] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha I was gonna say, I'm like. "Doom"?
[4:27:53] <teh_Question> ah yes, Returnal, the game where you're on a spoopy planet being chased by The Fury
[4:28:08] <%ekodrop> just once now
[4:28:10] <%dukenux> "Noo Buzz stop, we already got our ass to Mars"
[4:28:10] <+skylerpilot> used to be infinite, that wasn't intended. Its 1 per run now
[4:28:11] <Djinnazz> just the once
[4:28:11] <%hax_metatron> Can’t wait for Woolie and Reggie to “sleep” in Disco Elysium
[4:28:12] <%ekodrop> think they patched it
[4:28:15] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha I don't remember his name either
[4:28:37] <%dukenux> that's a nice american bungalow on this alien planet
[4:28:38] <TWOxACROSS> and it only gives you like a SLIVER of health
[4:28:43] <%dukenux> reminds me of Evil Within 2
[4:28:47] <laguerrilha> Colin Salmon is the laser room guy
[4:29:26] <chambatron> Hmm I don't remember that enemy
[4:29:28] <%dds333a> @dukenux call me nuts, but the first thing I thought of on the teleport is Shadow the Hedgehog's organic teleport pathways
[4:29:33] <%dukenux> So to those who have read/watched "Solaris": Does this game borrows much from it?
[4:29:48] <%dukenux> *borrow
[4:29:55] <TWOxACROSS> full L2 aim will also highlight enemies, so you can see them
[4:30:11] <laguerrilha> this game borrows more of Metroid and Edge of Tomorrow than anything
[4:30:16] <%andrewofbob> Hollowseeker
[4:30:24] <chambatron> Has woolie finished the game already?
[4:30:27] <TWOxACROSS> and phasing rounds
[4:30:49] <%dds333a> wanna risk it?
[4:30:55] <%hax_metatron> Best Shotgun of 2021 is Ratchet and Clank however
[4:31:14] <%andrewofbob> That was lucky; items stack
[4:31:25] <+skylerpilot> all of the Hollowseeker augments are great, Serrated, Retarget, Phasing, both Portals
[4:31:32] <%dukenux> Wait what's this? A blu ray of "Ride with Norman Reedus" from AMC?
[4:31:36] <%andrewofbob> @hax_metatron Mozambique or gtfo
[4:31:55] <+skylerpilot> Serrated, Portal Beam and Turret are amazing
[4:32:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> one sound has so much meaning
[4:32:49] <%hax_metatron> @andrewofbob Have to check that one out, but the Ratchet and Clank shogun with the PS5 controller is an EXPERIENCE

[4:33:38] <+aWanderingKaivo> man the currency drops in this game fade pretty fast don't they
[4:34:04] <%dds333a> Just when you're out, you're back in
[4:34:07] <Djinnazz> @aWanderingKaivo depends
[4:34:20] <+skylerpilot> @hax_metatron the mozambique is the pistol shotgun from Apex Legends, unless they buffed it. It was considered the worst gun in the game for the short time I played. Most likely hes being sarcastic
[4:35:06] <rReizs> tf2 mozam went from a secondary to a primary
[4:35:48] <@Menitta> They added 6 bullets to the Mozam recently
[4:36:00] <%dds333a> more lore
[4:36:02] <@Menitta> The Mozam going to primary ruined that gun in Titanfall
[4:36:07] <laguerrilha> LUL
[4:36:13] <Rahvith> LUL
[4:36:17] <TWOxACROSS> maybe different language - you can sustain the zapping for a longer time, not charge it for a big zap
[4:36:19] <%andrewofbob> In Apex, it got an upgrade that doubles damage vs unshielded enemies, then they increased the mag from 3 to 4, then they removed the upgrade but increased the mag to 6
[4:36:21] <%LastHazzerd> i can't speak russian
[4:36:21] <laguerrilha> like how easy he can transition it
[4:36:25] <%dds333a> Squid3
[4:36:31] <@Solidus_113> zoidberg
[4:36:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah yes the xapping system
[4:36:39] <%andrewofbob> Quite a mid-range burst with a good bolt
[4:36:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> zapping, too
[4:37:30] <%dds333a> compelled, huh WutFace
[4:37:46] <laguerrilha> some people really like tentacles
[4:37:56] <+aWanderingKaivo> its a communist bed

[4:46:28] <%andrewofbob> @BigBruthaThunda Hallways are scary; they represent a lack of choice; inevitability and powerlessness
[4:46:28] <@Menitta> @froduck42 what the fuck what ad
[4:46:35] <rReizs> amazing item
[4:46:35] <+aWanderingKaivo> an astronaut just standing there, menacing

[4:47:00] <TWOxACROSS> "it will not let you go"
[4:47:14] <laguerrilha> never though an astronaut standing would be terrifying
[4:47:27] <Djinnazz> not if you're a badass MFer
[4:47:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> like a true teleporter should
[4:48:02] <%dds333a> "Where are you going? And where have you gone"
[4:48:19] <laguerrilha> yeah
[4:48:22] <Johannen> Its that Argo Boat Existential nightmare....thats focked up
[4:48:24] <zzNamttamzz> All of them if you are good
[4:48:28] <laguerrilha> Hades you can beat first run
[4:48:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> you can beat end boss in Hades first run
[4:48:31] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah
[4:48:32] <rReizs> people did beat this on a fresh save
[4:48:36] <SkinnyRite> Do souls games count as rogues?
[4:48:38] <%dds333a> If you're THAT GOOD, yeah
[4:48:41] <Majestic_Flof> Isaac has a system at the end where you need like 4 items for the ending i think
[4:48:42] <%LastHazzerd> yeah Hades can do that
[4:48:55] <+toastybites> Depends on the game but I "beat" Risk of Rain 1 on the 1st try
[4:48:57] <%dds333a> You can beeline FTL Kappa
[4:49:00] <%Tearonex> People have beaten Hades and this game on the very first runs
[4:49:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> people speed run Hades, there's a dev commentary on one on yt
[4:49:12] <%jinking79> you'll only miss story stuff on first runs
[4:49:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> and Hades being Hades there's unique dialogue for going all the way through first run iirc
[4:50:12] <@Menitta> oh god those enemies are assholes
[4:50:30] <%dds333a> oh boy
[4:50:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> the puckering
[4:50:38] <%andrewofbob> No L
[4:50:42] <laguerrilha> Actually there is no dialogue change on the last boss if you do first run, its just the usual stuff
[4:51:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh no? thought there was
[4:51:07] <laguerrilha> on Hades
[4:51:08] <PMda2nd> money is pain
[4:51:31] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:51:33] <%DashXero> "He's giving me money."
[4:51:45] <PMda2nd> LUL
[4:52:08] <Djinnazz> fuck
[4:52:13] <Johannen> Leaving the item behind?
[4:52:26] <%andrewofbob> The item will hurt
[4:52:29] <@Menitta> he'd take damage from the malfunction
[4:52:29] <Djinnazz> or find locked chest somewhere
[4:52:31] <+aaymon86> Did they add an option to save?
[4:53:03] <Djinnazz> @aaymon86 no
[4:53:23] <TWOxACROSS> uuuh
[4:53:25] <TWOxACROSS> sometimes they do
[4:53:30] <lordrocca> Minh, Disengage the Safety Limiters on the Suit.
[4:53:39] <TWOxACROSS> but only like a handful of rooms with a few more enemies
[4:53:54] <+aaymon86> Goddamit man. That's the one thing holding me back from opening my copy cause I switch from game to game all the time.
[4:54:00] <TWOxACROSS> You can't go back to older zones
[4:54:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:54:18] <TWOxACROSS> Time to get disappointed!
[4:54:19] <Djinnazz> you can't do that
[4:55:01] <TWOxACROSS> Enjoy your extra like 10 HP :p
[4:55:05] <laguerrilha> it sucks all the dreams i had this part month are only nightmares
[4:55:16] <rReizs> time flies in this game
[4:55:20] <+aaymon86> It's a dumb design decision cause better rogue-likes have temporary saves.
[4:55:24] <drunken_lemur> Is this going to be a one-off?
[4:55:34] <TWOxACROSS> The super nerfed it
[4:55:39] <laguerrilha> yeah not having a logout save is dumb
[4:55:41] <TWOxACROSS> SUPER nerged it
[4:55:56] <Deasmeister> They nerfed it
[4:56:01] <%Lion_kun> super nerfed it used to be unlimited heal
[4:56:23] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha as someone who went through a period like that senior year of high school, I feel ya
[4:56:54] <lordrocca> The best healing is dodging.
[4:57:16] <%dds333a> @laguerrilha that's way in the past for me now, and I can't speak for ya really, but I'd like to say there's a light on the other side
[4:57:20] <rReizs> nightmares where you're back in school and have an assignment due
[4:57:24] <Deasmeister> nope healing isn't items
[4:57:40] <%andrewofbob> @lordrocca Best healing is don't get hurt in the first place
[4:58:01] <lordrocca> @lordrocca Indeed.
[4:58:26] <laguerrilha> @dds333a it doesnt really bring me down, its normally "well that really sucked" when i wake up
[4:58:41] <%RyTYoung> Who's on the sticks?

[5:00:07] <%RyTYoung> on the podcast
[5:00:17] <lordrocca> Heh
[5:00:18] <laguerrilha> HE stopped when the game bugged and lost his run
[5:00:31] <TWOxACROSS> new rooms can always have health pickups

[5:00:51] <@Menitta> "Back in the day last week"
[5:00:52] <Tracazoid> In the before times
[5:00:54] <lordrocca> We live in an accelerated timeline. A few months indeed does feel like a few years.
[5:01:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> well that's silly
[5:01:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:01:32] <iacus_> Even real roguelikes let you save and quit
[5:01:36] <@Menitta> I'm confused. When you mean "save system" do you mean just run suspension?
[5:01:47] <%andrewofbob> Let the tentacles carry you up
[5:01:47] <chambatron> that's why I don't wanna play right now. I don't wanna lock 3 hours into a run
[5:01:55] <%dds333a> LAAGE
[5:01:58] <%RyTYoung> Anyone see the game trailer for Recompile for PS5? that looks pretty awesome
[5:01:59] <laguerrilha> A checkpoint so you can stop mid run and then continue
[5:02:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> that was a godsend pickup
[5:02:05] <Deasmeister> I feel that's an intentional design decision if they're not changing it which sucks
[5:02:09] <laguerrilha> @Menitta thats what he means
[5:02:14] <@Menitta> Ah ok
[5:02:48] <laguerrilha> @Deasmeister oh definetly, that isnt going to get changed even with complains
[5:03:09] <@Menitta> Yeah it feels intentional
[5:03:26] <@Menitta> but at the same time, I'm not sure what it adds

[5:03:29] <%RyTYoung> SWORD
[5:03:32] <TWOxACROSS> now time for PARRIES~
[5:03:32] <laguerrilha> oof the animation clipping
[5:03:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> SPACE katana
[5:03:35] <gespenstkick> Yamato time
[5:03:35] <whirly25> j e d i
[5:03:37] <@Menitta> oh no its not synced
[5:03:40] <Rahvith> Weeb Stick PogCHamp
[5:03:40] <%dds333a> Disappointment NotLikeThis
[5:03:42] <%andrewofbob> Anime go up
[5:03:47] <%dds333a> TITLE CARD
[5:03:47] <lordrocca> Oh most definitely.
[5:03:51] <laguerrilha> still didnt fixed the weapon getting animations
[5:03:55] <TWOxACROSS> those blue dogs are done now
[5:03:55] <%RyTYoung> Sword ONLY run begins NOW
[5:03:56] <Rahvith> Motivated af
[5:04:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> just one attack? attack chains later?
[5:04:05] <@Menitta> You can't really rely on melee builds but melee is FUCKING USEFUL
[5:04:14] <TWOxACROSS> Guess what, you can parry enemies and cut through bullets!
[5:04:16] <whirly25> bettel darmarge
[5:04:28] <%andrewofbob> @aWanderingKaivo Just the one on a short cooldown, but it chunks health and stagger
[5:04:35] <%dds333a> Cut em up
[5:04:45] <iacus_> You can only carry 1 weapon at a time?
[5:04:45] <%RyTYoung> I can't imagine actually pulling off a melee only run, that would be insane
[5:04:59] <%RyTYoung> one thing that I don't really like about Returnal is the cap on artifacts
[5:05:00] <@Menitta> It's doable but it's REAL hard
[5:05:00] <laguerrilha> @iacus_ yeah
[5:05:04] <%andrewofbob> @RyTYoung I don't think you can even melee the zone 3 bosses
[5:05:16] <TWOxACROSS> Not everything can be fought melee, no way
[5:05:20] <+skylerpilot> can't melee the 3rd boss
[5:05:29] <@Menitta> Actually no there's a point where unless you ignore fights you can't melee kill
[5:05:30] <chambatron> you can't beat the boss on Level 3 with melee
[5:05:35] <%RyTYoung> @andrewofbob I wouldn't have thought so since he's miles away LUL
[5:05:46] <@Menitta> Oh yeah that boss
[5:05:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> the WALL
[5:06:21] <%dds333a> Iconic marvel Villain, THE WALL
[5:06:21] <+skylerpilot> @RyTYoung you can totally get up close to him, and even into what should be melee range. You just can't hit him with it. Ive tried
[5:06:43] <iacus_> I head this game is like Risk of Rain but the progression works
[5:06:50] <@Menitta> LUL
[5:06:53] <%dds333a> HOLY SHIT
[5:07:00] <+fetrigon> bitch. made.
[5:07:02] <%dds333a> he's on your ass LUL LUL LUL
[5:07:02] <%Irridium> "Fuck that shit I'm out!
[5:07:06] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot it would be annoying fighting that way anyway since he knocks you back and resets the fight
[5:07:07] <rReizs> its not a horror game in combat lmao
[5:07:08] <@Menitta> [gets sword] "HELP"
[5:07:12] <+skylerpilot> Woolie would absolutely love the Loader from Risk of Rain 2.
[5:07:13] <%RealThiele> tactical RUN AWAYYYY
[5:07:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> honestly yeah that makes sense better to fight them in a chokepoint
[5:07:15] <%dds333a> The door LUL LUL
[5:07:15] <laguerrilha> ye
[5:07:19] <PMda2nd> I respect that decision lol
[5:07:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> than in a big open room where they can fly around you
[5:07:24] <@Menitta> OOOH GROUND SURGE
[5:07:32] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot the Loader is a GODSEND
[5:07:33] <@Menitta> That's the best item in the game imo
[5:07:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> tactical decision
[5:07:44] <laguerrilha> Oh yeah i wonder if Woolie would like Risk of Rain 2
[5:07:46] <+skylerpilot> I love Loader, favorite character easy
[5:07:46] <%RyTYoung> Merc is my personal favourite in RoR2
[5:07:52] <heartlesshealer> stack, reggie
[5:08:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> nonsense, TACTICAL decision
[5:08:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1417355334386061312?s=19
[5:08:20] <TWOxACROSS> also don't forget slashing in the air has some tracking
[5:08:24] <+fetrigon> LUL LUL LUL
[5:08:27] <heartlesshealer> it's fiiiiine
[5:08:38] <%RyTYoung> I would probably say Woolie would have more attraction to Merc due to big swoard air combos
[5:08:59] <rReizs> doom 3 vs doom 2016
[5:08:59] <+skylerpilot> nah Woolie loves swinging mechanics
[5:09:03] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! He get anything REALLY good yet?
[5:09:19] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot ya grappling hooks in games are super dope
[5:09:46] <TWOxACROSS> ground surge good
[5:09:51] <TWOxACROSS> if you just tap it it'll auto-lock
[5:10:00] <rReizs> if you just tap it hits the closest
[5:10:30] <+skylerpilot> Loaders grapple swinging and momentum based damage on her utility is 100% up Woolies ally
[5:10:32] <%RyTYoung> I only we got another stab at a bionic commando game NotLikeThis
[5:10:48] <zzNamttamzz> First try?
[5:10:52] <%dds333a> Rob 64
[5:11:02] <+skylerpilot> also Loader is a she, so shes a punch girl
[5:11:10] <%RealThiele> welcome to earf
[5:11:14] <@Menitta> lmao
[5:11:16] <gespenstkick> Dang, Woolie with the call outs
[5:11:23] <Johannen> Mihn standing on the back of giants
[5:11:24] <+fetrigon> oof
[5:11:25] <%RyTYoung> @skylerpilot :O no way that's awesome
[5:11:31] <%dds333a> woah
[5:11:36] <Mundkipz> are we doing bloodborne rules? handoff on death?
[5:12:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> I'm liking this boss tbh
[5:12:15] <%dds333a> @mundkipz Reggie kinda decides to hand it off, but nothing has been set
[5:12:51] <@Menitta> WOAH
[5:13:03] <%dds333a> Second Wind
[5:13:12] <Rahvith> ShoopDaWhoop
[5:13:21] <%perfectsalami> this looks nuts
[5:13:22] <%bread_assassin> Does astronaut figurine need to be recollected on the next run or will it always give =1 lives?
[5:13:33] <+fetrigon> good one
[5:13:35] <@Menitta> that was a good run
[5:13:36] <%bread_assassin> *+1
[5:13:37] <TWOxACROSS> @bread_assassin if you find one, you get one on-the-spot rez
[5:13:41] <heartlesshealer> good job
[5:13:41] <+skylerpilot> needs to be recollected
[5:14:00] <Deasmeister> That guy rocked my shit for a while
[5:14:05] <%dds333a> that boss design reminds me so much of something
[5:14:23] <%dds333a> It's the head
[5:14:26] <TWOxACROSS> no
[5:14:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> kind of reminds me of Nier a little bit just because of hurty ball projectiles in a third person game
[5:14:37] <TWOxACROSS> you won't get one from the house
[5:14:41] <TWOxACROSS> That was your freebie
[5:14:53] <TWOxACROSS> You can't enter the house unless you have a reason to
[5:14:55] <+fetrigon> good shit
[5:15:05] <%andrewofbob> Good stream
[5:15:11] <laguerrilha> good game, damn i hope they launch at PC
[5:15:13] <TWOxACROSS> nice work
[5:15:18] <TWOxACROSS> love the panicked screams haha
[5:15:24] <%livlinn> GGs woolieKICKDAD woolieMINHMAX
[5:15:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:15:25] <@Menitta> There's a part in Returnal that blew my fucking mind
[5:15:31] <bujiraso> Great game
[5:15:47] <TWOxACROSS> space spookums
[5:15:51] <@Menitta> It gets DAAAARK
[5:15:54] <@Menitta> story wise
[5:15:59] <%natedrago> damn did i come right at the end? lol
[5:16:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> or the run is shorter
[5:16:21] <rReizs> how many runs was it
[5:16:24] <%thatother1dude> thatother1dude subscribed with Prime. 
[5:16:35] <Johannen> Enter the Gungeon added a save option later in updates
[5:16:37] <@Menitta> The weapon types aren't super varied but later on, each weapon type gets more passive buffs
[5:16:38] <he1lhydra> the call of duty mindset, you WILL play this game and ONLY this game
[5:16:41] <%dds333a> You can just close it, and you're good
[5:16:45] <@Menitta> That's where the variety comes in
[5:16:47] <%dds333a> normally
[5:16:48] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[5:16:52] <Prevot> suspend save
[5:16:56] <@Menitta> Theres just no run suspension
[5:16:58] <%andrewofbob> It needs to save the map and items
[5:16:59] <rReizs> at least returnal doesn't bloat the shit out of your hd
[5:17:13] <Johannen> Problem is not an absense of saves but the abusurd length of the RUN
[5:17:44] <TWOxACROSS> I've had two with drift so far :/
[5:17:51] <chambatron> Broooo that happened to my as well on my ps5 controller
[5:18:06] <TWOxACROSS> Warranty will still make you send it in, you paying shipping
[5:18:12] <%dds333a> Sacrificed on the altar of Returnal LUL
[5:18:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> ps5 controllers are having that problem? awesome
[5:18:17] <bujiraso> 1y?
[5:18:20] <%RealThiele> of all things the touchpad on our PS5 controller is going to shit already
[5:18:23] <%ekodrop> probably 1 year
[5:18:38] <stevenellis386> reminder to always get a warranty with these controllers going forward
[5:18:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> for real
[5:19:05] <%dds333a> That's piddly
[5:19:06] <chambatron> Overwatchsuck really bad with Drift
[5:19:20] <%ekodrop> drift is apparently covered
[5:19:38] <TWOxACROSS> Drift IS covered, but you have to pay for shipping :/
[5:19:41] <%dds333a> The most intensive game in that list is MAYBE DES
[5:19:45] <Johannen> Advance Rumble rummleded the heck outa those sticks)
[5:19:48] <laguerrilha> still will suck to have to pay shipping to them and get it back a month later
[5:19:50] <%livlinn> Try Contact spray, or qtip for emergency. Worked for me
[5:20:00] <@Menitta> I dont wanna be that "works for me" guy but I guess I've just been lucky, even with the Switch too
[5:20:02] <%RyTYoung> You know what sucks really bad with drift? trying to fight the final boss fight in Metal Gear Rising Revengeance NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:20:04] <chambatron> I wonder if the black and red controller have the same issue
[5:20:14] <@Menitta> I had 360 stick drift
[5:20:36] <%RyTYoung> 360 stick drift was the absolute worst
[5:20:40] <%dds333a> @menitta damn, your stick would just rotate uncontrollably Kappa
[5:20:51] <@Menitta> LUL
[5:20:57] <%livlinn> Drift in Animal Crossing is surprisingly VERY annoying woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:21:04] <%RyTYoung> @dds333a LUL
[5:21:14] <laguerrilha> Menitta going around round
[5:21:17] <TWOxACROSS> The one saving grace for not having mid-run saves is that you skip areas that you've already done, instead of going through them until you get to the end
[5:21:19] <@Menitta> But yeah I had a brand new 360 pad and it got drift almost immediately
[5:21:39] <@Menitta> oh god that was so stupid
[5:21:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh shit yeah
[5:21:48] <@Menitta> I can't believe that happened! HOW DID THAT HAPPEN
[5:21:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> that was AWESOME
[5:21:50] <%dds333a> oh boy
[5:22:04] <%RyTYoung> I must've went through about 8 Xbox 360 controllers, from halo odst to halo reach limited edition ones it was awful
[5:22:06] <%dds333a> LUL

[5:22:31] <+0dinpen> He MUST win
[5:22:37] <iacus_> The important thing is, if the dude he was arguing against conceded the argument
[5:22:40] <gespenstkick> That's commitment
[5:22:44] <+glassesaregod> We ABSOLUTELY take those
[5:22:45] <rosemon5001> he will get 1 year of no tea at most
[5:22:45] <%livlinn> Heated gamer moments huh woolieMIRIN
[5:22:56] <%dds333a> He probably didn't even win, the other guy just ignored it LUL
[5:22:57] <laguerrilha> Man the devs of the game must have had a laugh at that
[5:23:21] <%dds333a> Almost LITERAL Navy Seal Copypasta
[5:24:11] <bujiraso> Lol
