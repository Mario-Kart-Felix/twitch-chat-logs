[0:11:49] <+Dimfish> LMAO
[0:11:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Barter is inefficient. Currency solves several problems with it.
[0:11:57] <Superdandy96> Reggie wants the Commi way to return
[0:11:57] <khetrak> KH has the best name for it, munny
[0:11:59] <zedravan> just use copper coins it is anti bacterial
[0:12:00] <%INDECISIVEjew> Bartering is trash for introverts. They'll all starve

[0:12:16] <johnnydalmann> so we make districts @woolieversus
[0:12:26] <jevichrono> How much I missed and how much is the Blood pool now?
[0:12:31] <donstylo> I think stealing is the best payment system.
[0:12:31] <gekizenbu> currency is very convienient
[0:12:33] <+Dimfish> bartering falls apart at the city state level, not even global
[0:12:34] <+paladinstarbuster> RUPEES
[0:12:40] <$StaceMcGate> @jevichrono not much, and over $200
[0:12:49] <Superdandy96> Me likey gems
[0:12:52] <emperordread> Minh is literally describing how money came to be. Seasonal or irregular trades like getting wool or fish meant long periods where you can't barter because you don't have your goods to trade, so you get cash which preseves value
[0:12:53] <+l33t_j4gu4r> meal ready to eat
[0:12:55] <GoldeNOVA> I'll give you five bananas for a copy of Bloodborne
[0:13:04] <wendisky> Mad max has bullets

[2:03:13] <%jiggy_snipe> if Minh used the contract, it would put him in last place
[2:03:17] <flyingtentaclemonster> Pull your devil trigger Reggie!
[2:03:19] <Zalthia> If he uses the contract, doesn’t he loose everything?
[2:03:19] <privatesargent> so his low magic ability means he is easily killed by magic
[2:03:24] <+paladinstarbuster> ITS NOT FINE

[2:06:56] <abbock> @privatesargent magic can miss, stop lying
[2:07:02] <privatesargent> thats why magic builds can be so powerful
[2:07:03] <%andrei11dr> Get towns
[2:07:05] <kingkeldeo31> You can't use contract unless you have the bat floating above you
[2:07:06] <Xeno351> as long as minh has the contract i don't think reggie can get another i believe
[2:07:10] <Riottrio> @abbock field magic can miss, magic in battle always hits
[2:07:11] <Idon__> one shot holy shit
[2:07:21] <abbock> I have 200+ hours in Dokapon Kingdom. combat magic can miss.
[2:07:22] <sexdrugsvideogames> NICE
[2:07:34] <yeetdabsenpai69> @abbock your thinking of abbilities
[2:07:40] <Idon__> "I'm helping society" he says as his bug steals reggie's shit
[2:07:46] <+kekkerscrew> Spinner
[2:07:46] <Klefth> Soul mop?
[2:07:53] <+pectusumbra> 2 spinner
[2:07:54] <Riottrio> @abbock I have more, but you are totally wrong. The bottom slot is not magic, its abilities, and those can miss
[2:07:55] <crimsonsaens> "Offensive Magic uses Magic to deal damage to and potentially debuff the opponent. Unlike Attack and Strike, spells cannot miss, although the spell's damage can be decreased or negated with Defensive Magic. " from the wiki
[2:07:55] <Mrthefro> Minh is what you sound like when you're winning, Woolie.
[2:08:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[2:08:12] <moonologist> wow
[2:08:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> ??
[2:08:14] <%jiggy_snipe> thank you
[2:08:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> I just realized this game was rigged from the start....Minh is thhe grind King
[2:08:18] <Riottrio> @abbock say an enemy uses "quake", that is not a battle spell, it is a seperate option, and thus can be dodged
[2:08:19] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Mrthefro LOL

[2:08:56] <alephalpha> why is everyone so anti magic
[2:08:56] <Riottrio> @sandwichtaker now this is the actual take
[2:08:58] <crimsonsaens> REggie going ninja
[2:08:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> king: we need more thieves in the workforce

[2:09:38] <jubejube56> Lol even the boss misses on Minh
[2:09:43] <%MaddyCaddy> I bet you could hunt that Wabbit now
[2:09:44] <+pectusumbra> But that has even more defense
[2:09:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Fallen Honor
[2:09:51] <jevichrono> He already fallen so bad he became Darkling and still fell more
[2:09:55] <+pectusumbra> can you get a 1 and go shopping?
[2:10:00] <yeetdabsenpai69> woolie train or get a better weapon
[2:10:08] <jevichrono> Go fightin and shopping
[2:10:10] <Riottrio> @yeetdabsenpai69 I agree, if you are pure magic and steam roll the human players, you basically win the game. Especially because by steam rolling, you get best equipment and so you can attack against enemies that do have bounce/magic defense qualities
[2:10:10] <kingkeldeo31> They know about churches right?
[2:10:11] <%andrei11dr> Go to volcano Woolie
[2:10:20] <Xeno351> does he not know he can use them on monsters?
[2:10:24] <crimsonsaens> Just use it on a town monster
[2:10:29] <Riottrio> @yeetdabsenpai69 but arguably same can be said about pure speed builds I suppose
[2:10:42] <LeafarOz> you do know that you can use that on monsters @woolieversus
[2:10:46] <+agumon9000> Reggie give into satsui no hado
[2:10:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's 6 away
[2:10:50] <+agumon9000> BECOME DARKLING
[2:10:50] <alephalpha> magic builds have never failed me
[2:10:50] <%jiggy_snipe> @jevichrono when Reggie used the 1st Darkling, he had nothing at all. Now he has a couple towns because he actually started to play. He also got some levels from the Darkling shenaniganas
[2:10:53] <+Pookiedaexzile> CONTRACT
[2:10:53] <worldbrand> LUL
[2:11:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> reggie, woolies tnt goes off when you hit him...
[2:11:03] <+paladinstarbuster> MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE USED THE contract
[2:11:03] <%MaddyCaddy> Volcano!
[2:11:06] <alephalpha> plus the alchemist trick lets you win without a single town
[2:11:12] <GoldeNOVA> Reggie use the Behelit! SwiftRage
[2:11:15] <+Kduff89> minh has the confidence of a jojo villian rn
[2:11:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ooof
[2:11:21] <fetrigon> "this does put a smile on my face..."
[2:11:24] <sexdrugsvideogames> woolie vs pat
[2:11:26] <Riottrio> @jiggy_snipe towns are meaningless, you can get more towns that will be better in later continents. Being behind in levels is way worse
[2:11:26] <emperordread> Egg of the Conqueror
[2:11:34] <Idon__> GAMBLE IT WOOLIE
[2:11:34] <yeetdabsenpai69> @alephalpha untill someonee beats you and steals the money

[2:11:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> listen to your heart
[2:11:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> And you'll heal
[2:11:58] <jevichrono> When you got nothing to lose, you can only fall so flat. Falling a lot more from losing a lot more.
[2:11:59] <TigerClaws12> S T R I K E

[2:12:26] <moonologist> minh mind games
[2:12:28] <alephalpha> @yeetdabsenpai69 so if you store the money as items to the king you can't lose it
[2:12:41] <+fateirony> what a tanky cleric
[2:12:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1
[2:12:47] <yeetdabsenpai69> but you ned towns to get items the king wants?
[2:12:49] <aurasviel> USE THE POWER OF DARKNESS
[2:12:50] <+nintega010> warrior goes to ninja
[2:13:00] <+Taglog7> ti catch corona is my real test
[2:13:04] <alephalpha> you only need one
[2:13:06] <+l33t_j4gu4r> secret pokemon master job
[2:13:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[2:13:07] <%andrei11dr> Should've got magic since his a cleric now
[2:13:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> use the cystal now
[2:13:09] <%jiggy_snipe> @Riottrio which being a Darkling for a bit helped. He was really far behind in levels before he started "grinding" and attacking towns with Darkling powers
[2:13:17] <privatesargent> the big bug doesn't always take items each turn
[2:13:20] <+agumon9000> :)
[2:13:24] <crimsonsaens> Contract is only usable by last place3
[2:13:26] <nachohangovers> No you have to be in last to use a contract.
[2:13:31] <yeetdabsenpai69> @alephalpha samething as before 1 fight and you got no town
[2:13:35] <chickenhunter> nah the contract teleports you to the space and can only be used by last place
[2:13:37] <yeetdabsenpai69> DARKLINGDOM
[2:13:38] <khetrak> FIGHT HIM
[2:13:39] <+paladinstarbuster> get that town
[2:13:41] <Klefth> Steal it from Mihn
[2:13:55] <kingkeldeo31> Contract only works when you have the bat above you
[2:13:56] <Riottrio> @jiggy_snipe I think I misunderstood you, I think you are also in agreement that being a Darkling now would be beneficial and I misunderstood that
[2:14:01] <%andrei11dr> It's always good to have
[2:14:01] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The contract teleports you to the darkspace
[2:14:06] <Gramcracker55> In a pinch you could become the darkling the hard way.
[2:14:14] <sexdrugsvideogames> why not use contract?
[2:14:16] <privatesargent> you have to have the bat thing to become a darkling, and you need the contract to teleport or else you need to manually go the the darkspace
[2:14:21] <crimsonsaens> Might as well sell everything
[2:14:26] <TigerClaws12> cause he's in 1st place
[2:14:33] <crimsonsaens> The bug will eat them regardless
[2:14:33] <Malik1002> Reggie did you change your job
[2:14:36] <yeetdabsenpai69> @sexdrugsvideogames cowardice and idiocrasy

[2:15:11] <alephalpha> @yeetdabsenpai69 well yes but while playing the game you're never gonna be behind long enougha nd in most cases you're gonna be out of the way for mos tplayers
[2:15:15] <+agumon9000> Woolie you can buy better shield for more defense

[2:17:30] <privatesargent> Reggie refuses to take risks
[2:17:39] <%jiggy_snipe> it will disappear when you have nothing left
[2:17:39] <Superdandy96> Reggie

[2:27:24] <Mrthefro> But it was actually the right choice for Reggie since he was gonna die anyaway.
[2:27:26] <khetrak> reggie in your fight with minh, there was no reason to do anything but counter and you didn't do it
[2:27:26] <+kekkerscrew> Counter is Hype when it connects that's why
[2:27:26] <privatesargent> we have all been saying give up, and before then most of us have been saying use magic more
[2:27:26] <+RowenCleric> Reggie sounds so dead inside Im scared all
[2:27:30] <Idon__> never not risk everything
[2:27:31] <%andrei11dr> Yea you dumbo :)

[2:30:03] <Riottrio> @dseok14 usually a double murder
[2:30:03] <thejuice200> for the whole week
[2:30:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> @dseok14 does it?
[2:30:05] <Blackjack760> it's a week
[2:30:17] <Camail> then they're 100% off
[2:30:25] <sexdrugsvideogames> that makes it 100% off
[2:30:26] <yeetdabsenpai69> @dseok14 big bad shows up you fight him and ALL towns with monstrs on them are for the lading blow dealer
[2:30:29] <+pectusumbra> So Woolie just needs to run his ass back north to that weapon shop

[2:30:56] <+paladinstarbuster> STEAL GROAT
[2:30:58] <NeroInfinite> You can't touch them
[2:31:00] <Riottrio> @alephalpha totally agree, but I am also of the mindset that Darklings are always a good idea, unless you are literally last chapter, then you should probably just go for kill steals
[2:31:08] <jevichrono> I hope Minh get better Equipments
[2:31:11] <FloresIsDead> punch throat steal groath
[2:31:35] <%SirGO0SE> MIKE MAKES DA RULES

[2:31:52] <Riottrio> @alephalpha I'm exaggerating, darkling definitely drops off earlier than last chapter
[2:31:55] <alephalpha> @Riottrio yeah I tned to be more cautious of darkling maybe abit too much but reggie has basicallyd one nothing since darklingdom

[2:45:20] <glaciusinfinite> yep
[2:45:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> *gasp*
[2:45:24] <sexdrugsvideogames> just when reggie was on a roll
[2:45:25] <TigerClaws12> emulation fuckery. what are ya gonna do
[2:45:25] <+king_of_beggars> I have the sudden urge to try playing Hero Versus.
[2:45:27] <%ekodrop> the game felt reggie's cowardise
[2:45:28] <buerdo> Old games
[2:45:30] <jevichrono> !uptime
[2:45:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 2 minutes
[2:45:30] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Its a glitch with Dolphin and the Dokapon rom. I've played 3 story modes with it, and the audio glitches after battle sometime
[2:45:30] <Daba_mk2> yeah
[2:45:32] <%RioGascar> Save state?
[2:45:32] <%Livelinne> It’s fiiiiine
[2:45:35] <LeafarOz> ooofff
[2:45:35] <flyingtentaclemonster> Happens with legitimate 15 year old hardware, we understand
[2:45:37] <%Thunderhog> lytWORRY
[2:45:37] <jevichrono> Yeag
[2:45:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> REGGIE
[2:45:41] <%Solidnick18> oh nooo
[2:45:45] <binkarus> It happened after reggie's fight finished. I think it lagged and caused the desync problem
[2:45:46] <pappyvanpoodle> Arthritis grandma on the turntable
[2:45:47] <Foopoof> oof
[2:45:51] <%andrei11dr> I wonder if it's a frequency thing
[2:45:53] <LeafarOz> oh noooo
[2:45:56] <SixthSun2> Sounded like it was the game, not you guys
[2:45:57] <%jiggy_snipe> does Woolie's bell go to his phone?
[2:46:00] <%Livelinne> Oh no
[2:46:05] <binkarus> like game lag caused the audio to trip up
[2:46:05] <TigerClaws12> it was the game
[2:46:11] <Junkles> voice audio was fine. game audio was stuttery
[2:46:15] <%andrei11dr> I hope it wasn't something important
[2:46:17] <NickHatesSnow> Drink some water
[2:46:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont like how that chat is implying that woolie would...ugh emulate...we only game on the legit hardware here..
[2:46:20] <Junkles> game video was fine I think
[2:46:34] <+FaderPotater> Reggie allowed it to tilt woolie, his heart is corrupted
[2:46:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> rom on virtual console?
[2:46:38] <Casinoroyale80> POWER UP
[2:46:42] <Riottrio> this manga has filler? Or does the anime just skip over content?
[2:46:48] <binku_muja_> As people are saying, it seemed to be the game at fault.
[2:46:49] <TigerClaws12> it was the emulator proably, it happens
[2:46:56] <jevichrono> Anime skips content
[2:46:58] <%Solidnick18> ok
