[0:05:00] <+iLike_femboys> woolie and reggie gonna get divorced :(

[0:05:09] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @karldeck when its done

[0:05:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:05:33] <+Feralspirit41> Meat loaf is delicious anyone who says otherwise is insane
[0:05:38] <@Solidus_113> Good meatloaf is surprisingly hard to find
[0:05:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> anchovies make a great meatloaf sauce base
[0:05:41] <%Nested_Dreams> @lion_kun Might be the Canadian Roadwork Sawblades
[0:05:48] <%CptnCampy61> Bad meat loaf is real bad though
[0:05:50] <+cubbywolf> nah
[0:05:52] <Parapattern> They gotta be crispy
[0:05:53] <FoxInABeret> Yeah, meatloaf is totally one of those foods. People assume it's gross 'cause their parents made it badly.
[0:05:53] <%HossMosh> brussel sprouts are the meatiest vegetables
[0:05:55] <+cubbywolf> thats bacon man
[0:05:57] <%mitchteck> Does anyone hear buzzing?
[0:05:57] <+mtlsars> anything with bacon and garlic butter is decent lol
[0:06:01] <%Juriasu> super meatboy is happening outside woolies apartment

[0:06:18] <khalcatto> same as crickets

[0:06:23] <Royal8383> hey yall
[0:06:25] <ergulor> Weird i was told it was delicius but is eaten a lot
[0:06:35] <majindusto> Meatloaf is GREAT Tho!!!
[0:06:39] <%BinaryFireball> brussel sprouts are also the shit
[0:06:39] <+shiplord13> Has he ever seen Rocky Horror Picture Show?
[0:06:47] <%MajorCrasher> bad meatloy is fucking terrible
[0:06:54] <%saiko2208> Brussel Sprouts are amazing
[0:06:55] <%MajorCrasher> meatloaf*
[0:06:56] <%ekodrop> woolie gonna try ballut?
[0:07:00] <Clundy> Meatloaf is just B I G B U R G E R
[0:07:01] <%Nested_Dreams> Meatloaf is like unportioned meatballs? Never had a good meatlog
[0:07:02] <+ColonelHandzLanza> Meatloaf was/is a peasant food maybe that's why
[0:07:02] <@Menitta> Hello
[0:07:04] <DSD24> Spake?
[0:07:06] <%Noonoox12> god, I love TSKR
[0:07:06] <Equirah> I think the meatloaf thing is more of "I've had it for the last 14 meals"
[0:07:11] <+Dova573> You think white people seasoned their meatloaf?
[0:07:12] <%JustYudha> I thinks its pretty good
[0:07:14] <leith_aziz> Never saw it actually
[0:07:15] <%Juriasu> speak spoke spake
[0:07:21] <%HeroToxiko> it's so good
[0:07:21] <leith_aziz> I do like Rohan
[0:07:21] <%JustYudha> Too short tho, I need more lol
[0:07:25] <Deko_> totally not
[0:07:32] <+cubbywolf> does the chat not hear the buzzing?
[0:07:32] <wibbwobbler> meatloaf rules
[0:07:32] <andre11dr> Because it's a fucking insert
[0:07:33] <cosmicgoatee> they're very distinct side stories
[0:07:33] <+BigCoffee> @Nested_Dreams Nah you add more spices, and breadcrumbs, and more wet stuff. A good one is totally different
[0:07:36] <%HossMosh> if Rohan isnt who the hell is?
[0:07:37] <%Lion_kun> Stone Ocean anime when!?!
[0:07:38] <Ner234> @cubbywolf I didn't even notice that until I turned my volume WAY up. How loud are listening to this?
[0:07:39] <%0rond> I genuinely believe araki DOESN'T REALIZE it's him
[0:07:42] <majindusto> I DON'T BELIEVE HIM
[0:07:48] <+karldeck> @Lion_kun Soon on Sunday
[0:07:49] <Equirah> @Nested_Dreams if it's a log of minced meat it's not a meatloaf, proper meatloafs have layers
[0:07:51] <DatAsuna> Now watch me give him dedicated sidestories
[0:07:52] <+Dova573> Clearly Rohan is a stand in for Oda Kappa
[0:07:54] <%MooseIsGoose> Trust me in fact I hate him now lets give him his own show
[0:07:55] <+cubbywolf> i turned my volume up just now

[0:08:32] <+iLike_femboys> deadly premonition 2 is def the worst game of last year
[0:08:32] <leith_aziz> it actually becomes entertaining and you want more of it
[0:08:33] <%ekodrop> you can kinda replace the breadcrumb element in meatloaf with tofu
[0:08:35] <%smyld> smyld extended their Tier 1 subscription through October!

[0:26:48] <BourneWarrior> HITMAN got rebooted since YanSim started
[0:26:51] <Tracazoid> LUL My Great, Great, Great Grandchildren will be on their deathbed before it's released.
[0:26:51] <Meltgar> Variants are bs, if it doesn't stick to you with droplets you will get infected out of a sudden by looking at someone next time
[0:26:53] <+black_pariah> someone else is gonna have to rebuild that thing from the ground up
[0:26:56] <+iLike_femboys> why play yandere simulator when you have both hitman and persona
[0:26:56] <Darren716> You guys were so hyped for MN9, Yandare, and Scalebound
[0:26:57] <+RyTYoung> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:27:02] <andre11dr> Again im sure will find it somewhere on the deep web
[0:27:04] <MrPedrovsky> C U M _ C H A L I C E
[0:27:14] <Prevot> is yandere more or less of a scam than that one huge kickstarter space game?
[0:27:15] <%Exiliator> Didn't someone else make a finished game in like a month?
[0:27:17] <generalve> But then it kept going and going and going and -

[0:29:56] <Royal8383> Hi woolie! I was just curious which streaming software you use. looks good!
[0:30:06] <@Menitta> Also there's another game with the same premise coming out
[0:30:08] <+KaijuUltimax> HL3 will release before Yander Simulator
[0:30:09] <leith_aziz> Well I soppouse if it takes too long, you lose interest
[0:30:19] <@Menitta> So yeah, with that specific one, there's no novelty
[0:30:24] <andre11dr> Yeah it's almost like Woolie changed q little in a decade
[0:30:32] <Blank9> we have anime souls games now, anime hitman is nothing
[0:30:39] <EternalJedi> @WoolieVersus I ordered from Artesian a couple weeks ago, do they email you when your build is about to come up on their build streams?
[0:30:41] <dds333a> as far as we know, anyway
[0:30:43] <%justcallmebobplease> Hint: It doesn't.
[0:30:44] <%X2Eliah> Tbh the meme of "xxxxxxx Simulator" is a few years out of date by now
[0:30:49] <aiutare47> Fuck origin
[0:30:55] <Prevot> origin DansGame
[0:30:56] <dabeaminator> Ugh, Origin.

[0:32:23] <Qsmash_> Umbrella Chronicles, huh? Guess that's why I'm so confused.
[0:32:24] <%Javaa01> Woolie, just make a notepad on your phone

[0:32:26] <RyuuAoi> I have vodka.

[0:32:31] <andre11dr> RE ia probably the most inconsistent franchise ever LUL
[0:32:31] <RyuuAoi> What're we doing?
[0:32:38] <JetpackMcQuack> Surfing through the key art folder for Teppen cards
[0:32:38] <+KaijuUltimax> Never dig too deep into Capcom franchises, you'll find the weirdest shit. Unfortunately, Teppen seems to exist JUST to bring out that weird shit
[0:32:40] <+RyTYoung> @woolieversus What's the buzzing noise in the background?
[0:32:42] <+BigCoffee> umbrella chronicles is also a legit fun lightgun game
[0:32:43] <DandyDanteGameplay> so that buzzing?
[0:32:44] <%cache_22> I do hear a high-pitched whine sound. Like coil whine.
[0:32:46] <therealtacopancakes> yo the JSRF gogglees on tyrants
[0:32:48] <DandyDanteGameplay> is it a bug?
[0:32:52] <%X2Eliah> @RyuuAoi according to the past 10 minutes of discussion, some kind of anime porn simulator
[0:32:55] <kainsonofdeath> damn those tyrants look like daft punk
[0:32:56] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ Hype
[0:32:58] <leith_aziz> Different subject, but I hope Strive does well and gets enough attention for a good time. People are hyped right now, and I hope that hype continues. Im basically saying I hope it gets close to mainstream attention, because it has the chance to right now.
[0:32:59] <WanderingYoren> remember the twins from the matrix, this is them now, feel OLD YET?
[0:33:00] <@Menitta> Menu narration cool
[0:33:02] <DatAsuna> white tyrants huh? Surely that could never exist

[0:33:49] <SunsetJack> It is gone.
[0:33:53] <DandyDanteGameplay> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:33:58] <%Lion_kun> That buzz has been on the whole time
[0:33:59] <andre11dr> Ok now it's gone
[0:34:00] <Awarets> its not gone the mics are just muted while they try and fix it
[0:34:01] <Applecannon63> ah nvm

[0:34:28] <%Javaa01> It's still a bit buzzy
[0:34:29] <Awarets> its still there
[0:34:31] <andre11dr> Yeah it's definitely still there
[0:34:31] <PMda2nd> yeah
[0:34:31] <%johnny_gogo> its a bit lower now

[0:34:40] <%patriotrenegade> its almost inaudible
[0:34:41] <Spoofy16> yes
[0:34:42] <RyuuAoi> You're
[0:34:42] <%Juriasu> it's only there when you are talking
[0:34:44] <%Lion_kun> Yes
[0:34:45] <Awarets> its not a huge deal if you cant figure out how to fix it
[0:34:46] <%mitchteck> Yes
[0:34:47] <MrPedrovsky> Yes
[0:34:47] <%Noonoox12> oh god my tinnitus is hiding it. I can't tell at all
[0:34:48] <+RyTYoung> Yeah
[0:34:49] <@Solidus_113> noise gate?
[0:34:50] <EternalJedi> it's more like a sharp whine
[0:34:57] <Clundy> Jiggle the audio wires?
[0:34:59] <MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus Like a mosquito behind an ear
[0:35:04] <Ipsenscastle> it might be more audible on headphones than speakers
[0:35:05] <%X2Eliah> It definitely sounds like an electrical feedback/leak
[0:35:16] <ZComiX> The buzz is from the game. It‚Äôs from the enemy type on the BG
[0:35:25] <EternalJedi> it's like a circular saw from really far away
[0:35:26] <%X2Eliah> And yeah it's high pitched so e.g. laptop speakers or 2.0 speakers might totally hide it
[0:35:28] <%johnny_gogo> @Ipsenscastle to fair everything is
[0:35:28] <ZComiX> bc there are bugs
[0:35:31] <RyuuAoi> You should probably be using the Kirby headphones. That's the real issue here.

[0:36:17] <dds333a> not too loud to disrupt, not too quiet to ignore
[0:36:18] <leith_aziz> With Strive getting a lot of attention from all fighting game players, specifically casuals from DBFZ, and it being a mainline EVO game, is there a chance it can gain mainstream attention ? I hope it can gain that audience, even for a month or two.
[0:36:21] <RyuuAoi> IN THE DARK *guitar riff* IN THE DARK
[0:36:22] <%X2Eliah> @ronin19xx Depends on the camera. Can be doable on some, some cams need firmware hacking, some are just lol nope

[0:38:00] <Jetsfantasy> I think GG is at it's best chance of getting itself out there. Having an anime fighter be mainstream is a big ask, but it probably won't stay as niche as it has @leith_aziz
