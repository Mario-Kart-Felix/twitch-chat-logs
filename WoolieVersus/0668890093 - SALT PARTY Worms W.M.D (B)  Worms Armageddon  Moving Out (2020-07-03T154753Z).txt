[0:58:53] <thesoothe> Are they playing with controllers?
[0:59:00] <%gatorafan> I bet Woolie played that mode with EVERYTHING unlocked
[0:59:05] <%Asuterisuku> The jumped off the modern version of the game in favour of the classic.
[0:59:06] <NiktenKing> Being able to play games at school... the good ol' days
[0:59:07] <+LCLSmoothie> is flux on?
[0:59:08] <+fizzguy47> what are they playing on
[0:59:09] <derap41> Nah you hugged around that kayboard
[0:59:13] <%rcand9> everyone has worms armageddon stories
[0:59:19] <Kiaayo> this game was made before xinput
[0:59:20] <dukenux> I know Armageddon is a classic, but we mainly played WWP
[0:59:20] <TheA1ternative> They had this at my school, WHY DID THEY have it at schools?
[0:59:34] <Nekros4442> I had CoD 2 at my school
[0:59:36] <Nekros4442> So that's a thing
[0:59:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man looks like we just need to go back to WMD, Ooooh wel
[0:59:43] <InugamiTheHound> (Initialize) Initial drive (Customize) Initial dream
[1:00:06] <+DreyfussFrost> It does that.
[1:00:13] <+Toshatron> alt + end to turn off flux
[1:00:21] <%Asuterisuku> Windows has a setting for that built in now.
[1:00:22] <Lee_The_Limey> Which worm did you all main? Kappa
[1:00:32] <%jinking79> shit i missed everything
[1:00:40] <%optimasmaximas> no you didnt
[1:00:44] <%optimasmaximas> dont worry
[1:00:49] <+brack_twitch> Mine gets brighter as the day goes on
[1:00:49] <@Solidus_113> Flux/Night Mode makes the monitor use warmer colours
[1:00:50] <+jjjkopf> lowers blue light
[1:00:53] <@Solidus_113> so everything is tinted red
[1:00:54] <derap41> I don't mind lowering light but the orange is anoying
[1:01:11] <+brack_twitch> No cave
[1:01:17] <Itselguapo> Yo look at this classic ass game
[1:01:20] <+DreyfussFrost> The problem with flux is sometimes it shows up in the capture, so the colors are completely wrong.
[1:01:29] <nothuzad> "woolie will figure it out"
[1:01:33] <+DreyfussFrost> Especially if you're watching a video with flux when you have flux.
[1:01:37] <dukenux> this interface really didn't age as badly as yo'd tihnk
[1:01:43] <+TDotGoat> don't forget to spend a few hours naming the teams and the worms

[1:13:52] <Viewtiful_Rose> It’s always been that on pc worms
[1:13:58] <%Asuterisuku> @raknikmik Frankly, I feel they should've stuck with the new one. Because it actually had a useable UI.

[1:14:31] <zakor1138> @TheLemuroid Nostalgia
[1:14:32] <%optimasmaximas> favorite worms game
[1:14:35] <iwilliams> resolution in this game is kinda messed up without a plugin
[1:14:37] <+raknikmik> @asuterisuku Well then we wouldn't have this disaster I guess haha.
[1:14:37] <+RealThiele> 1080 x 768
[1:14:39] <TheLemuroid> That makes me sad
[1:14:46] <derap41> You can change it in in INI file
[1:14:58] <thesoothe> Game zooms with high resolution
[1:15:10] <Lancaster_H> just play wmd
[1:15:15] <%NecDW4> play in 640x480 Kappa
[1:15:17] <nothuzad> old game is old
[1:15:20] <OperatorJo_> only the hypest live troubleshooting for SuperBeast fans
[1:15:21] <+DreyfussFrost> The menu always runs at 640x480 apparently.
[1:15:22] <nimu290> oh no this is rough
[1:15:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> No plans, no backups.
[1:15:27] <+DreyfussFrost> You won't see it until you start the game.
[1:15:28] <+heroicspiritavenger> Is there not a Switch port of Armaggedon?
[1:15:41] <%Posh_Cat> kaoxdWSIP
[1:15:44] <iwilliams> yeah menu and in game are separate resolutions unless you get a mod

[1:58:07] <Solidnick18> oh that effect i understand
[1:58:11] <%kyh9> I have played the main 3 Fate games, plus Fate Zero. It's trash
[1:58:13] <+coachacpatterson> Woolie Vs fate?
[1:58:19] <0rond> imagine the timeline where woolie is into fate
[1:58:20] <Amoeba_Bait> Fate/Stay the fuck away

[1:58:29] <glass_marcus> Nah Fate's garbage
[1:58:29] <+worldbrand> as someone who watched fate/stay night, that was the easiest way to get out of fate ever
[1:58:30] <+RealThiele> i bet he mains BLM like a degenerate
[1:58:31] <Amoeba_Bait> Also that pedo lolo Fate
[1:58:31] <%Asuterisuku> The VNs bored me.
[1:58:34] <+heroicspiritavenger> ...how is Fate hard? Just fucking play the visual novel's three routes and then watch Fate Zero and just FUCKING STOP
[1:58:35] <@Solidus_113> Fate/Stay out of my house
[1:58:39] <%kyh9> I have consumed the LITERALY VNs and they are shit
[1:58:45] <%Valask> Y'all are weak
[1:58:46] <+LCLSmoothie> gacha games will do that
[1:58:50] <%redrins> imagine watching the shitty old fate anime

[1:59:19] <0rond> fgo is pretty good these days
[1:59:21] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Fate Zero was good
[1:59:22] <+heroicspiritavenger> Everything outside of FSN, Zero, and Hollow Axtaria are officially licensed fan fiction
[1:59:24] <turbofolk> "I was too busy watching sfiv streams"
[1:59:26] <Potatoidea> There's a bunch of people out there that only know Fate from FGO fanart
[1:59:26] <%NecDW4> OH SHIT! Curse of the Moon is getting a sequel
[1:59:29] <+LCLSmoothie> when fate fans spend 4000 dollars for a jpg and voice lines
[1:59:29] <%BisoromiBear> the only decent part of fate is the end of Heaven's Feel
[1:59:31] <%haisho> speaking of which, incoming salt season for FGO
[1:59:36] <+Mittastic> i feel the same way about FGO, I want to get into but gacha is trash. and I suck at fighting games
[1:59:39] <damienlunas> @heroicspiritavenger But do you play the original version with full mollusks or play the rereleases
[1:59:40] <%kyh9> I want Pat to do a Spite play-through of the first three fate games
[1:59:45] <%Rekinsinn> get sum fuc
[1:59:45] <+RealThiele> that curse of the moon sequel had a DOG as a playable character
[1:59:51] <Solidnick18> could have been
[1:59:52] <%Livelinne> Fate anime by ufotable is solid
[1:59:52] <zenith0111> The fact people play Gacha games like FGO NotLikeThis
[2:00:03] <+heroicspiritavenger> @damienlunas You play the one with the fucking mollusks and giving bitches energy with semen
[2:00:14] <0rond> you can absolutely play FGO 100% f2p
[2:00:18] <%dinnydanny777> They dropped the combo
[2:00:21] <%fangovafang> LuvOops

[2:00:35] <turbofolk> Woolies excuse to not doing anything popular: "i was busy with not popular thing"

[2:00:50] <damienlunas> Too coward to FLEX
[2:00:51] <%haisho> a lot of people try to play FGO because it's also a VN, but everyone falls into the gacha eventually
[2:00:52] <%GrassCannon> ...

[3:01:56] <%jiggy_snipe> chat said alright not good
[3:02:01] <+TOONFOOD> it was different but I'm glad they went back. I had some fun with Forts
[3:02:02] <purekyun> worms 3d is meh
[3:02:05] <%RioGascar> Its not something I would play again, but i did enjoy my time
[3:02:14] <%2hutown> Worms Armageddon was the best hands down.
[3:02:15] <ConeCorvid> resounding praise that it wasnt complete shit
[3:02:16] <RetroCop87> To be fair, people also love Sonic Adventure
[3:02:20] <@Solidus_113> Worms 3D is better than Metal Slug 3D
[3:02:27] <%RioGascar> ^
[3:02:28] <+Fenrein> And I agree
[3:02:29] <%optimasmaximas> it is inferior, but it's fine
[3:02:30] <%jiggy_snipe> ok
[3:02:31] <%SirCheesedip> Compared to 2D it's garbo, but 3D is good in it's own merit
[3:02:32] <Meltgar> True
[3:02:33] <korth367> that's fair
[3:02:35] <+LCLSmoothie> fax
[3:02:53] <+TOONFOOD> Anyone remember hogs of war?
[3:02:55] <%dinnydanny777> It was really hard
[3:02:58] <nintega010> yeah. it was easy
[3:03:22] <+Estuko> @TOONFOOD for some reason I'm reminded of Goblin Commander from the PS2 lol
[3:03:41] <%Bonte__> Calculating Wind in 3D was a nightmare.
[3:03:51] <a_mad_dragon> BANANAS YOU FOOL
[3:03:52] <+ChrisAlgoo> Qbasic!
[3:03:54] <asurite_warrior> You could do some cool shit in it but it wasnt as solid as the 2d worma
[3:03:55] <%RioGascar> well if you just keep making 2d worms...ya kinda cant take it further
[3:04:07] <%RioGascar> like the game has a limit of what it can do
[3:04:10] <%dinnydanny777> All the dumb shit was fun to see in 3D thouhh
[3:04:18] <%kyh9> Wind in 3D games is 2D
[3:04:19] <%jessyg920> I always thought of it as Tanks
[3:04:21] <BlackermanZX> personally i liked forts for the 3d ones and Armaggedon for the 2d
[3:04:34] <blaggablag> my only real gripe with it was the terrain deformation system was super clunky and unsatisfying
[3:04:40] <nintega010> homing missile just homes
[3:04:46] <%dinnydanny777> The Prod in 3D was pretty funny
[3:04:48] <+TOONFOOD> @estuko never heard of it but I'm gonna have to check out a game with that name LUL
[3:04:50] <%dinnydanny777> So was the Granny
[3:04:54] <%dinnydanny777> And the sheep
[3:04:56] <maria_luke> (are we in the final minutes/ hour of the stream?)
[3:05:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's not obfuscation, it's math
[3:05:09] <%redrins> its just simple wind, not a hurricane LUL
[3:05:13] <nintega010> worms 4 mayhem has the fat kid
[3:05:17] <+Estuko> @TOONFOOD it's fun, I spent thousands of hours playing that game with my friend lmao.
[3:05:22] <%RioGascar> I also never got to the play the multiplayer for worms 3d. Only the campaign
[3:05:52] <Meltgar> Worms world party was what number of worms game?
[3:05:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> minh with the initial d shirt, nice
[3:05:55] <Jp_DrZaius> scorched earth
[3:06:01] <%SirCheesedip> I'm looking forward to seeing all the Youtube videos saying "Worms had a hard time adjusting to 3D"
[3:06:07] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus Golf with friends would like to talk to you Woolie
[3:06:10] <whirly25> woolie is reaching past the oort cloud for this analogy
[3:06:35] <%Bonte__> Not to mention the way the 3D environments would sometimes glitch out. I'd have Bazooka shots explode on me because it would hit a pixel of land that wasn't destroyed.
[3:06:36] <%dinnydanny777> I appreciated seeing all the goofy Worms stuff in 3D
[3:06:39] <themightyseptopus> Ninja GAiden wind
[3:06:48] <KeiPrime> yeah ninja gaiden 2 wind
[3:06:52] <+A_mere_shrubb> The wind going into KIRBYS Mouth
[3:07:06] <%RioGascar> Fuck wind in nes ninja gaiden
[3:07:15] <RetroCop87> FUCK YEA STORM EAGLE
[3:07:17] <%Rekinsinn> its weirdly hard to think of examples
[3:07:19] <Djinnazz> Jump King.
[3:07:24] <%dinnydanny777> Ace Combat?
[3:07:27] <blaggablag> also the rebranding of worms from reinforcements to 3 kinda sucked. The babyfied aesthetic looked really dumb
[3:07:28] <@Solidus_113> Sniper Elite on hardest difficulty
[3:07:31] <+Estuko> how do you pronounce his name? Ryu or Ryu?
[3:07:38] <medril07> damn wind
[3:07:59] <RetroCop87> The wind in SMB2 (JP) is ACTUALLY the worst thing ever in the franchise
[3:08:08] <+TOONFOOD> @estuko I'll check out a let's play 😁
[3:08:09] <%kyh9> Woolie, you interested in the new Hades update?
[3:08:27] <%SirCheesedip> I'd like to see the worms team attempt 3D again, hopefully there's been enough time to have it work better than the first attempt
[3:08:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> rumtumtugnutz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months!
[3:08:41] <+Estuko> @TOONFOOD if there is any, haha I haven't looked anything up in ages. It's been more than a decade
