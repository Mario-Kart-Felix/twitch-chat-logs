[0:12:11] <Darren716> Woolie how do you get updates then?
[0:12:13] <black_pariah> i have the opposite problem, usually
[0:12:13] <%Javaa01> Windows Server is meant for long sessions
[0:12:13] <%derap41> Did you have a cheap ass PSU?
[0:12:20] <%sparkly_yoyo> My cousin got a warning because his laptop had been on for a month, I didn't even know that warning existed

[0:12:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @th3smartalec Chrome hungers for more
[0:12:49] <%derap41> Windows 10 is pretty good about updating without having to restart these days
[0:12:57] <ExpressNode> I turn my computer off everytime I don't use it
[0:13:02] <black_pariah> i restart just to restart sometimes
[0:13:04] <cheerfulnpc> That's weird as fuck, the opposite happens for me. Restarting the PC fixes everything for me.
[0:13:06] <%derap41> You PSU is shit ass probably
[0:13:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @generalscpatton THE LORD HUNGERS
[0:13:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You can disable updates witjout keeping youyr PC on tho
[0:13:14] <%Javaa01> Yeah don't do sleep and hybernate
[0:13:19] <%kinetikpaws> I need to reformat so bad

[0:13:41] <ExpressNode> Hold on didn't Woolie talk about this exact thing a few years ago on the podcast. I'm getting a weird sense of deja vu
[0:13:45] <%sparkly_yoyo> I just turn it off, no wishy washy bullshit
[0:13:53] <ghoulishcripple> i have that same premise with my ps4pro. it only likes rest mode
[0:14:06] <black_pariah> as someone who went to pc repair school, i feel youre 100 percent wrong, but i cant tell you youre wrong
[0:14:09] <ghoulishcripple> i power off and it boots with a glitch or issue
[0:14:09] <Solidnick18> my shit is just shit
[0:14:17] <+jiggy_snipe> @ExpressNode he's talked about this multiple times. Podcasts, LPs, etc.

[0:14:34] <+Superbro64> If you can stand the electric bill of keeping stuff on, sure. But I don't have the funds for that sort of thing.
[0:14:34] <+Rhinoprotoss> Woolie vs technologu
[0:14:34] <%Javaa01> Hibernate basically makes a savestate of your RAM and shuts down completely, and loads the state when you boot next time, and that's not good for a PC
[0:14:35] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I do the same woolie
[0:14:36] <%krispen_wa> Is this the Luddite Woolie arc?
[0:14:38] <%Chatterbox1991> what your discribing is why i bought my Cybergaming Rig as opposed to building
[0:14:50] <BearSawed> @derap41 Ohhhhhhh you that kind of guy hugh?
[0:14:52] <+Superbro64> Especially with the ac running. All electronics go off when I leave for work.
[0:14:56] <%Ozmodyas> Hi Woolie, used my Prime free trial to sub to you a little bit back. Wasn't sure how to send a sub message for the stream so I'm trying various things to see which works, feel free to ignore the extras: Don't know if this came up before, but Beldam's name isn't a pun on Bedlam but rather an existing english word that means witch/hag/crone, which supposedly comes from the French phrase "La Belle Dame sans Merci" ("The Sweet Lady without Mercy"). It's also the name of the monster from Coraline.
[0:14:58] <%derap41> PC part have become way more robust in just these 20 years
[0:14:58] <CrematedCube> I'm not the same, but I sympathize with the paranoia
[0:14:58] <%MrAtheGreat> Those were good days, back when you had green\amber color text
[0:15:19] <CrematedCube> I actually watched S.E.Lain at your recommendation, it was darkly fun
[0:15:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Ozmodyas Interesting
[0:15:34] <%krispen_wa> Have you tried turning it on and off again?
[0:15:36] <%derap41> Barely have to worry about ESD these days
[0:15:36] <%oadf_threestrikes> i didn't realize that sleep mode was so bad for the computer
[0:15:37] <+linSP> “Oh god why isn’t this $1000 piece of metal not working”
[0:15:39] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @Superbro64 AC yes, everything is is negligable. You might save a couple bucks a year at most lol

[0:16:03] <HotMafia81> my primary PC was once dead for months because a hold down tab in the USB-C port was shorting the whole PSU.
[0:16:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ozmodyas Neat, though that's not likely to reach him.
[0:16:06] <%KaitlynnHere> I just watched my friend spend three hours trying to figure out why my windows app wouldn’t update
[0:16:06] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> hope you didn't fry your motherboard with static electricity!
[0:16:06] <@akuda_bar> this is why i just paid a guy to do it lol. so if he breaks it, he pays.
[0:16:07] <time_axis> are you wearing your q-ray bracelet

[0:16:21] <%GenericSoda> this is why I just get my pc's from AVA direct
[0:16:23] <+jaayro> pushing it is fine, but why it gotta go like "erererrrrrrrrr" the whole time

[0:16:31] <+linSP> rip*
[0:16:33] <%derap41> So you bought cheap PSU that explains a lot
[0:16:40] <ExpressNode> The only thing I get nervous about is probably putting my my GPU then putting in the cables for the power
[0:16:40] <CrematedCube> Losing the magic smoke
[0:16:49] <MasterMushin> Back to console!
[0:16:54] <%GenericSoda> you cant let the magic blue smoke escape
[0:17:14] <asurite_warrior> Did I come by at the end?
[0:17:25] <%sparkly_yoyo> the only other game I can think of where everyone knows you is Mario, funnily enough
[0:17:29] <dizimous> I plugged my fans in from 2 spots for a bit when I was changing Motherboard/processer but we good

[0:45:16] <%krispen_wa> Woolie speedrunning would just be his bloodborne playthrough
[0:45:17] <cheerfulnpc> Ya'll amateurs: you can't put the, that, an, etc. in front of the word updog- it ruins the person's response.

[0:46:34] <%alexandrecau> not much to test it's just sweet treat
[0:46:36] <+thunka10> not different
[0:46:39] <%SoupBowler> Sweat Feast... no I mean, Sweet Fee- Fuck!
[0:46:48] <%SoupBowler> Tilting left also works

[0:47:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Finally, some good fucking food
[0:47:21] <%sparkly_yoyo> overkill
[0:47:22] <%SoupBowler> It's 5 SP tho
[0:47:24] <%Papa_Bearman> Treat is done.
[0:47:24] <%sparkly_yoyo> gud
[0:47:28] <%KyoryUtchy> Literally more than your max HP
[0:47:29] <straycatrock> i think it assumes youve been levelling ur hp and fp more than you have
[0:47:32] <%ozmon> VIOLENCE does 8 damage, so good
[0:47:32] <%glass_marcus> Semi Auto
[0:47:33] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 5
[0:47:36] <+linSP> sometimes you need a big heal tho
[0:47:38] <%afronooch> 5
[0:47:39] <SchwaAkari> Sweet Feast is the Occultist Wyrd Reconstruction of TTYD
[0:47:42] <%Papa_Bearman> Five.
[0:47:42] <penitentpentwitch> It's expensive, but it gives a lot of FP back
[0:47:43] <%Bootkiller6> Costed 5, but you're so stylish who cares
[0:47:45] <%kyh9> It's a full heal tho
[0:47:46] <%Bootkiller6> you'll fill it back
[0:47:46] <%chosenjuan42> With your low HP sweet treat is enough
[0:47:53] <fritz_dacat> Gotta get that Appeal up
[0:47:56] <cosmicgoatee> 5 Stars....Restaurant Quality
[0:47:57] <heartlesshealer> a lot of stars for what amounts to an Elixir
[0:48:00] <Daniel_Is_I> It's worth it though
[0:48:01] <NotHereToStream> comeback mechanic
[0:48:01] <sunnythedrunk> It would be useful if you weren't BP fiends
[0:48:05] <edward11231> YES
[0:48:05] <+Euphbugg> Its good for the FP recovery
[0:48:06] <@CrankyVT> Better get stylish ' v'9
[0:48:06] <%krispen_wa> Using 2 sweet treats is way more efficient
[0:48:07] <noe_juan_kanobe> Lvl3 vs Lvl1 Super
[0:48:08] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> its RAW
[0:48:09] <%sparkly_yoyo> it's better when you have more HP
[0:48:12] <%SoupBowler> If you know how to manage resources, Sweet Treat for 1 SP is good enough
[0:48:14] <%Estuko> @crankyvt cranky5Pat <3
[0:48:14] <CrematedCube> Save up in tough fights
[0:48:15] <petwisk> not worthed
[0:48:17] <+Wilabeen1997> Big cost, big payout
[0:48:23] <%ozmon> And an average of 15 FP, so that's pretty big for more power in a long fight
[0:48:27] <%MrAtheGreat> For emergencies.
[0:48:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @crankyvt cranky5Blush cranky5Hype cranky5Pat
[0:48:32] <Mr_Strut> But that's 4 stars and three turns
[0:48:37] <%MrAtheGreat> Better off just sweet treating every so often.
[0:48:40] <%relentingapunch> It's for doese big long fights
[0:48:40] <Sol_Install> it worth it tbh when shit dire
[0:48:44] <%chosenjuan42> your life SHROOM fills like 2/3 of your HP
[0:48:45] <shiny_prinny> if you slot in more HP Plus and FP Plus badges it might seem more useful
[0:48:46] <%relentingapunch> Also holy shit heys cranky
[0:48:47] <%Papa_Bearman> Did you notice that there was only one Poison Mushroom? It's less risk as well.
[0:48:50] <Daniel_Is_I> It's 2-3 sweet treats in one turn
[0:48:53] <+MagiKestral> take that arrow to Merlin asap
[0:48:55] <Sol_Install> plus that is 4 stars and wasting 3 turns yea
[0:48:56] <heartlesshealer> 5 stars & 1 turn as opposed to 4 stars & 3 turns
[0:49:00] <%SoupBowler> Also keep in mind that items can heal you if you have lots of mushrooms and whatnot
[0:49:01] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaHmm useless
[0:49:01] <BlackermanZX> if you dont have hp and fp and you cant wait more turns

[0:53:26] <dreadedcthulhu> man we just used the entire population of xerxes to make our squad better
[0:53:28] <TrapperCap> It’s yoshi’s final smash
[0:53:29] <%kyh9> Single turn
[0:53:29] <missingangle> It's just the Yoshi final smash
[0:53:31] <@CrankyVT> pretty a-four-dable
[0:53:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Kreygasm

[0:53:33] <%ozmon> Mario's Partner is Mario
[0:53:33] <%relentingapunch> 100% worth it
[0:53:34] <%notgarza> Gang tackle: Yoshi
[0:53:35] <cosmicgoatee> ;)
[0:53:35] <$Invlux> ;)
[0:53:36] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> FE Dancer
[0:53:36] <Drusain> She gives Mario her turn
[0:53:37] <toasty_scones> it's busted
[0:53:38] <+zooeymainbtw> rally wink is great
[0:53:39] <%kyh9> the BUFF
[0:53:39] <%Proxzo> Basically give up Goombella's turn to give mario another term
[0:53:40] <%afronooch> ;)
[0:53:40] <%alexandrecau> wink for courage
[0:53:41] <Daniel_Is_I> Rally Wink is pretty much her giving her turn to Mario
[0:53:41] <heartlesshealer> ;)
[0:53:41] <ghoulishcripple> chunky Yoshi
[0:53:42] <%Brutalyte616> It gives you an extra move.
[0:53:44] <JetpackMcQuack> GivePLZ turns
[0:53:44] <fritz_dacat> woolieYE Lets go
[0:53:44] <SchwaAkari> Rally Wink is situational in my opinion
[0:53:44] <BlueFusionVolt> It's af4able Kappa
[0:53:45] <%Shwepie> 4 FP to give Goombella's turn to Mario.
[0:53:46] <sunnythedrunk> ;)
[0:53:46] <andrex2311> ;)
[0:53:47] <%i_heart_gaming> rally wink plus double item
[0:53:49] <CocoonMoon> ;)
[0:53:51] <+linSP> Dancer goombella
[0:53:51] <GenkoForrest> 1 MORE
[0:53:52] <%kyh9> the healing is EXPENSIVE
[0:53:53] <%Proxzo> Remember Goombella's attack goes up 1
[0:53:53] <%relentingapunch> ;)
[0:53:58] <noe_juan_kanobe> Reequip CP
[0:53:59] <petwisk> and with Double dip you can extra Boost that
[0:53:59] <%xcompleasedad> Wink is God-Tier with this build
[0:54:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> D&D taught us that action economy is king
[0:54:07] <+thunka10> Dont forget you can Respec partners too with Chet
[0:54:12] <%glass_marcus> Haste
[0:54:12] <%Papa_Bearman> @Shwepie That's two Star Power uses, potentially, if they need it.
[0:54:12] <SchwaAkari> Bobbery's and Vivian's are the most nuts IMO
[0:54:15] <%nxflre> has he tried hold fast yet?
[0:54:18] <%Blind_Pro> Dont forget that boosting them also increases their attack and HP
[0:54:23] <+paladinstarbuster> charge+wink is godlike
[0:54:24] <sunnythedrunk> Bomb squad and Koops can also hit all enemies
[0:54:25] <SchwaAkari> Bobbery's is like, 8 damage on everything I think
[0:54:25] <Louie_Salmon> Don't forget that Violence now has 1 more attack, so his basic attack does way more
[0:54:32] <cosmicgoatee> rally wink + boost attack star power + power bounce kolOPWA
[0:54:33] <%sparkly_yoyo> I don't think I've ever seen someone strategize so much with this game, and I love it
[0:54:34] <jettsetter> also buffs their damage
[0:54:36] <+linSP> All their other attacks also get stronger
[0:54:36] <thetntm> don't forget boosting adds 1 attack
[0:54:37] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> attack up
[0:54:38] <missingangle> yeah we do
[0:54:40] <Thepothero> Aoes for days
[0:54:40] <sunnythedrunk> Violence attack boost is more important
[0:54:42] <+TuskAct4> Yeah Bobbery is always my first pick
[0:54:45] <%kyh9> Try it out
[0:54:49] <%Papa_Bearman> Whatever, just one more Sprite and you can get Bob-ombast.
[0:54:50] <JetpackMcQuack> gotta look cool
[0:54:53] <ghoulishcripple> violence got +1 in his attack power. hes a beast

[0:56:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> @xeros720 It's always 1 level's worth for 1 level's worth
[0:56:53] <%KyoryUtchy> I think the only downside is that you're limited by how many HP/FP plus badges you have.

[0:58:01] <%relentingapunch> MY LIFESTYLE
[0:58:02] <jettsetter> DANGER
[0:58:02] <%xcompleasedad> CEASE YOUR TRANSGRESSION
[0:58:04] <Snowfellow> One step away from the Danger Mario run
[0:58:05] <%kulmoth> but what is the point
[0:58:05] <+Someone_Kooky> 5 HP
[0:58:05] <Solidnick18> danger mario PogChamp
[0:58:06] <%SoupBowler> It begins
[0:58:07] <+zooeymainbtw> @akuda_bar ?
[0:58:08] <%relentingapunch> DETERMINES MY DEATHSTYLE
[0:58:08] <%Brutalyte616> This is where we break the game.
[0:58:08] <%ozmon> That's awesome, that's less HP than you start the game with LUL
[0:58:10] <%chosenjuan42> D A N G E R
[0:58:12] <%Proxzo> Call an Ambulance...BUT NOT FOR ME!
[0:58:14] <time_axis> the only real downside here is that you're wasting coins
[0:58:14] <%sexdrugsvideogames> when someone punch you just BOB AND WEAVE
[0:58:17] <cheerfulnpc> I'm not gonna lie, this is baffling.
[0:58:20] <+Slattsquatch> DANGER TIME
[0:58:21] <AstrodropGaming> Decrease HP even more, lets get dangerous!
[0:58:24] <%xcompleasedad> Scenes that led to disaster
[0:58:24] <SirDogBear> How can one person handle this much power?! PogChamp
[0:58:26] <NotHereToStream> akuma run
[0:58:29] <@akuda_bar> @cheerfulnpc modular stats. that's all.
[0:58:30] <+thunka10> I was always too much of a coward to do this
[0:58:31] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:58:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kulmoth the option. if he does this now, he can use badges to change it later
[0:58:37] <CrematedCube> Terrifying freedom
[0:58:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:43] <+xeros720> yeah, that was my thought, you need to buy the plus badges, but well, whateverr
[0:58:44] <%sparkly_yoyo> Gotta be honest, always knew Woolie would become Danger Woolie
[0:58:48] <%Rosen_Thorne> might want to put on timing tutor for the new moves
[0:58:48] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> leave some room for growth
[0:58:51] <$Invlux> Woolie has become the strong
[0:58:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> now...what can you do with your partner?
[0:58:54] <+TrevSmith222> He's slowly turning into Danger Mario.
[0:58:57] <BlackermanZX> this is the true run
[0:58:58] <%chosenjuan42> !Motivated
[0:58:58] <@Moobot> 1492 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:59:01] <+xeros720> woolie is always Danger Woolie
[0:59:03] <%Plz_Bro> modular woolie
[0:59:04] <cheerfulnpc> @akuda_bar I guess if it were me I'd prefer a little more HP buffer for when I remove stats via badges
[0:59:04] <Drusain> There is a BP cap eventually fwiw
[0:59:06] <ghoulishcripple> this is like when ippo sealed the Dempsey roll to increase his overall power through limitations
[0:59:08] <%relentingapunch> !MOTIVATED
[0:59:08] <@Moobot> 1493 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:59:10] <JetpackMcQuack> cyr5Head numbers dude
[0:59:12] <+Someone_Kooky> !motivated
[0:59:12] <%Bootkiller6> Yeah but the cap is like 99 BP
[0:59:13] <scorpionoutcast> ...this is gonna last for 10 battles tops
[0:59:15] <%alexandrecau> money and time to be in the same situation
[0:59:18] <%kulmoth> inb4 he insta dies
[0:59:18] <+thunka10> Badge based cybernetic body modifications
[0:59:19] <%Papa_Bearman> 78 coins well spent?
[0:59:21] <@akuda_bar> @cheerfulnpc he can just decide to have more or less hp though.
[0:59:22] <thetntm> if you reach the bp cap then you should actually upgrade hp
[0:59:22] <%gatorafan> Warframe Mario
[0:59:24] <SchwaAkari> You need a second HP Plus if this is your build
[0:59:26] <%SoupBowler> I would laugh hard if Woolie grinds Power Rush badges off screen after this lmao
[0:59:30] <%nicversus> Woolie is a tankie confirmed
[0:59:31] <%xcompleasedad> "Tankier" LUL
[0:59:33] <$Invlux> Hey if we hits the BP cap, we hits it

[1:31:13] <+RazgrizStraits> @Th3SmartAlec don't give him attention he'll just keep going
[1:31:16] <%eriksdrums> eriksdrums gifted a Tier 1 sub to sexdrugsvideogames! They have given 27 Gift Subs in the channel!
[1:31:17] <%chosenjuan42> FIRST ATTACK BADGE?

[1:31:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> @razgrizstraits sorry, misread the room on that one
[1:31:41] <%sexdrugsvideogames> @eriksdrums wow, thanks bro!
[1:31:50] <%eriksdrums> @Th3SmartAlec Already subbed so I can't gift you one, but keep that positivity going
[1:31:56] <%xcompleasedad> @WoolieVersus Do you want to guess recipes, or should we tell you some?
[1:31:56] <+RazgrizStraits> besides, it's woolie. what more u need. i knew he was going to freak out at this game. nothing like some necromancy and divorce in a kids game. also gambling and strippers.
[1:32:01] <sunnythedrunk> Storage is like 32 items I think
[1:32:26] <%sparkly_yoyo> money is a non issue at this point
[1:32:29] <%sparkly_yoyo> Woolie bought gold
[1:32:33] <%Lion_kun> A book you read earlier said to combine a mango with a peach.
[1:32:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> @xcompleasedad he doesn't really care about recipes right now
[1:32:35] <+RazgrizStraits> @xcompleasedad apparently say nothing or @dmcRedgrave will have a b* fit
[1:32:37] <samdamgocham> This is truly a one-of-a-kin game

[1:32:41] <%eriksdrums> Was planning on one, but fuck it @pory_z , you participated

[1:33:06] <%pory_z> @eriksdrums wow thanks man !
[1:33:11] <%ozmon> But there's no way the game's gonna tell you 51 recipes, right?
[1:33:15] <%eriksdrums> <3
[1:33:22] <@akuda_bar> these guys are just tricky, you have to learn how they move and then it's easy
[1:33:25] <sunnythedrunk> LONG LIVE THE KING
[1:33:28] <+williss_> a lot
[1:33:28] <+RazgrizStraits> KEEL MANGO+ Cake Mix is best.
[1:33:29] <%sexdrugsvideogames> @eriksdrums sry for assuming you're a bro btw
[1:33:29] <%chosenjuan42> Most recipies not given must experiment
[1:33:30] <%kyh9> 10 or so
[1:33:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[1:33:37] <AyyBurden> @woolieversus the quest giver is in the room where you found the sluice crank
[1:33:42] <%kyh9> MIX THAT SYRUP WITH THE MANGO

[1:33:44] <+RazgrizStraits> or Keel Mango + Turtley Leaf
[1:33:46] <%sparkly_yoyo> some recipes are given, others you find by testing
[1:33:48] <%ozmon> 3+2+1+3+2+1+1? 12 I think!
[1:33:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> get em boys
[1:33:56] <+RazgrizStraits> some you will never find.
[1:33:57] <%ozmon> Er 13
[1:33:57] <ghoulishcripple> @woolieversus BTW i saw your Teppen Tweet. gonna come for you at the peak of the mountain!
[1:34:06] <%Bootkiller6> Keel Mango has like 5 or 6 recipes it's in, I think
[1:34:07] <+RazgrizStraits> here's a recipe you will never find
[1:34:09] <%eriksdrums> @sexdrugsvideogames I would, in fact, self-identify as a bro
[1:34:12] <%Bguy32> unless defense
[1:34:14] <phantomsleeves> @woolieversus you should just look at a guide for recipes when you're ready for them
[1:34:15] <%sexdrugsvideogames> hahaha
[1:34:16] <time_axis> maybe if you charge him
[1:34:20] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> so 1 armor
[1:34:20] <cosmicgoatee> might wanna grab a coconut
[1:34:30] <+Sharmanyx> Woolie is crushing it with the stream numbers!
[1:34:31] <%SoupBowler> Using charge or power rushes on VIOLENCE is really good
[1:34:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ghoulishcripple You two gonna fight shirtless in the rain on the highest peak of Mount Olympus?
[1:34:37] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ohhh shit we this far???
[1:34:42] <%xcompleasedad> Woolie is figuring it out. SeemsGood
[1:34:46] <%sparkly_yoyo> the defense calculation in this game is so simple that it's actually pretty weird
[1:34:47] <%benbag13> it doesn't though?
[1:34:48] <%ozmon> There issss one caveat with armor. If you get through it on your first hit, you will do at least 1 damage with all your other hits!
[1:34:49] <Thepothero> The violence is almost ultra one might say
[1:34:51] <%bbblaketwitching> it'd definitely reduce by the end

[1:35:12] <+RazgrizStraits> @WoolieVersus there is a recipe you will never find, and it doesn't matter, but there is a roll the dice shoot yourself for power item, called TRIAL STEW. it puts all hp and fp to 1 and maximizes star power.. it looks cool when u use it but yeah
[1:35:12] <abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL
[1:35:13] <%SoupBowler> Actually, multihit moves like that still scale with charge. So it would be a charge of + 2 dealing 5,4,3,2,1 and back to 1's

[2:11:37] <%chosenjuan42> woolieONEGUY why!?
[2:11:38] <%Bootkiller6> Now we're playing 5D chess boys
[2:11:38] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie wants to find out for himself at least
[2:11:39] <noe_juan_kanobe> ?
[2:11:39] <StarMechV> it aint worth it
[2:11:43] <%sparkly_yoyo> not really worth it
[2:11:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> Make another save
[2:11:44] <Rain_Mage> It is because your Obsessed with Violence
[2:11:46] <%Proxzo> Was it after goom goom?
[2:11:48] <SchwaAkari> Let Woolie drive at the speed he wants to drive, chat
[2:11:48] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Woolie is such a perfectionist
[2:11:50] <%kinetikpaws> this is the exact reason Pat makes 70 saves
[2:11:51] <%Papa_Bearman> Just play the video on YouTube and dub in commentary?
[2:11:51] <Ner234> SourPls
[2:11:51] <%benbag13> no no no no
[2:11:51] <pmmori> it's legit one line
[2:11:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> How much dialogue are we missing? Enough to cram in one dono?
[2:11:53] <noe_juan_kanobe> Whu happening?
[2:11:54] <+dukeofhammer> use a save state
[2:11:55] <%ozmon> Oh yeah, Goomgoom's got stuff to say about every partner, right? Man, this game
[2:11:57] <%AFrostyCookie> ALL that again for what like 2 lines?
[2:11:59] <theCoolChild> Can he even save state?
[2:12:04] <%LastHazzerd> i think he's just looking up a youtube video
[2:12:05] <abelincoln_catpuncher> it's not a big deal
[2:12:07] <%eriksdrums> If this isn't making it to Youtube, feel like answering a few Twitch questions?
[2:12:08] <shiny_prinny> if you saved after the trouble it might be worth it, otherwise idk about that
[2:12:09] <time_axis> now that he knows where he's going and will be skipping all the dialogue, it probably wont be too bad, tbh
[2:12:12] <Darren716> Its super not worth it
[2:12:12] <%kyh9> save state
[2:12:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls

[2:12:31] <%chosenjuan42> Is this manga filler?
[2:12:32] <%SomeSageAdvice> its no prob Woolz lol
[2:12:32] <penitentpentwitch> The Anime has a lot of problems, the Manga can shoulder one or two
[2:12:34] <%Bootkiller6> Man I hate when the anime cuts content out of the manga
[2:12:36] <%Chatterbox1991> (Jerma's playing God Hand)
[2:12:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's good, a side effect of being a Manga reader

[2:14:57] <%chosenjuan42> Pimp out other party members
[2:15:00] <ghoulishcripple> time is ripped asunder
[2:15:03] <%Ozmodyas> You can talk to the goomba with other party members for unique dialogue
[2:15:04] <+PositivelyNick> WR pace notekFeels
[2:15:04] <+thesw1tch> @jiggy_snipe its the actual game
[2:15:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dmcredgrave If the mod wants to prevent needlessly replaying stuff for one tiny line, they can.
[2:15:08] <Darren716> Thats why we're here to warn you
[2:15:08] <%eriksdrums> Alright Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got to go teach kids how to hit the drums! Thanks for being cool!
[2:15:09] <%Proxzo> Its okay. Let him do it
[2:15:11] <%ozmon> I would want to do that too
[2:15:12] <sunnythedrunk> The check is fair
[2:15:13] <%Prevot> this is why you save at every opportunity
[2:15:15] <%ElbyBoxus> its replay value
[2:15:15] <%sparkly_yoyo> Iss OK, I'd do the same tbh
[2:15:16] <%inkthepeasant> Reggie's shirt is great
[2:15:21] <@akuda_bar> the instinct is fair but live, it's a bad idea
[2:15:25] <%chosenjuan42> It's ok we can't go back in time
[2:15:26] <%Bootkiller6> You miss so much just because each partner has unique dialogue - it's gonna happen all the time
[2:15:27] <+Cuon_Alpinus> I want a starfox mameshiba
[2:15:29] <%alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus while you'Re there try to hook goomba with flurrie
[2:15:31] <%Bootkiller6> Don't worry about it too much
[2:15:31] <BlackermanZX> the special save button huh Keepo
[2:15:32] <%sexdrugsvideogames> lets twitch questions then
[2:15:32] <+Superbro64> Is it worth mentioning that Dolphin can save states so you can literally quick reload..

[2:15:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> akuda_bar being the MVP and saving all the time.
[2:15:45] <mothdude> Do you want people to warn you ahead of time when the Shadow Sirens will show up so you can bring Vivian out?
[2:15:46] <%GoneWithLaw> Wow Woolie has TWO HD GameCubes?
[2:15:46] <CnS_Panikk> ALL IS SAVED
[2:15:46] <%dmcRedgrave> I'm pretty sure he's capable of googling it if he really has to. He doesn't need you to rescue him.
