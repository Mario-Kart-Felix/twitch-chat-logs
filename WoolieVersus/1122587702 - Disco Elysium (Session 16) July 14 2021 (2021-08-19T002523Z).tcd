[0:06:12] <WeepyDevil> we have some stuff
[0:06:14] <%dds333a> They don't have Country Club like in DR, so I don't care LULcare
[0:06:16] <BigCoffee> why would you even want to drink bad sodas
[0:06:20] <leith_aziz> So the opposite?
[0:06:21] <WeepyDevil> maybe this is a quebec thing
[0:06:23] <+livingdynamo> @Jiggisnipe got some bad news for you buddy
[0:06:25] <%livlinn> So Canada's basically europe
[0:06:27] <%holydeviant1> I saw a fucking JALAPENO STRAWBERRY energy drink once!
[0:06:34] <OfficerMods> Angry beaver barrage x
[0:06:37] <dukenux> Sodas are worse than beer for you anyway
[0:06:39] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus you want some ranch soda? I'll send you ranch soda
[0:06:40] <majindusto> Any reason the Podcast episode still Isn't on Itunes yet?
[0:06:46] <leith_aziz> That's basically me when Ren and Stimpy is mentioned
[0:06:47] <%krispen_wa> DBZ Kai was on Nickelodeon, so does that mean we can get Goku in Nick Smash?
[0:06:49] <%Juriasu> C L U T C H
[0:06:59] <%bread_assassin> IS Loud House big enough to warrant two characters?
[0:07:01] <@Solidus_113> The nick game doesn't have the clutch button, but it is generally faster than Slap
[0:07:02] <%eanscrale> They sucked
[0:07:05] <primaryfire> I'm boycotting until they add an ed edd n eddy character
[0:07:06] <+coolthulhuu> when's Nick X Cartoon Network!
[0:07:07] <lol_red_ranger> it's just gonna be another one of those
[0:07:13] <%bumpynavel> bumpynavel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! I agree with you on morality in video games but with a different take. Its not that I CANT enjoy a game a huge asshole as a protagonist, but it makes it significantly harder for me. It feels to good to be good. I feel gross being bad, even in games.
[0:07:13] <dukenux> never knew Doug was Canadian. kinda makes sense
[0:07:15] <leith_aziz> @krispen_wa Tier List being discussed : "But can he beat Goku?"
[0:07:19] <%dds333a> Like Nick license stuff?
[0:07:20] <OfficerMods> yeah I didn't care at l

[0:08:02] <Iandrasil> in a time of corona and very little offline fighting game action available good netcode is a must have
[0:08:06] <andre11dr> It like that early 2000s stuff
[0:08:07] <%wolfofsound> imagine being a kid wanting to play that and just gets fucking destroyed by local fgc

[0:10:19] <+livingdynamo> hell yes
[0:10:20] <leith_aziz> Wolfenstein New Order is a great one
[0:10:22] <Trace_Bovier> anyone tried playing disco Elysium with all stats at 12
[0:10:23] <%dds333a> Living Laser and Crimson Dynamo fusion NotLikeThis
[0:10:25] <%DatAsuna> when are we gonna get a long time donator first time viewer?
[0:10:27] <Majestic_Flof> Wooo i made it for once
[0:10:28] <guiltyboya> ayaya
[0:10:38] <linSP> wolfenstein yeyeye
[0:10:39] <%krispen_wa> @trace_bovier plague did
[0:10:39] <leith_aziz> I really wanted to buy Titanfall 2, but hackers gallore right now
[0:10:40] <%DatAsuna> Wolfenstein's pretty decent arcadey shooter
[0:10:48] <+livingdynamo> wolfenstein is such a banger of a series man
[0:10:53] <leith_aziz> Shame, cause I loved my time with Titanfall 2 on console
[0:10:55] <andre11dr> Just make sure is New Order, not the older 2008 one
[0:11:08] <primaryfire> gotta do our yearly flushing out the nazis in the audience
[0:11:11] <%krispen_wa> WHENS BLAZBLUE LORE WOOLIE
[0:11:12] <leith_aziz> Honetly, you can just play New Order and Old Blood
[0:11:14] <+livingdynamo> i know a lot of people have gripes with the new colossus but i bet woolie would be sold if he saw the axe executioners
[0:11:15] <%bumpynavel> @trace_bovier I've seen it, it's interesting for a little bit but becomes too much quickly.
[0:11:27] <mrhappy6677> Yeah Woolie's gotta go binge Jojolion now Kappa
[0:11:32] <%dds333a> @krispen_wa when he gets paid for it Kappa
[0:11:34] <leith_aziz> I kinda agree
[0:11:42] <%dds333a> I don't
[0:11:45] <+Jiggisnipe> that makes sense
[0:11:46] <OfficerMods> disco is wrapping up anyways
[0:11:48] <leith_aziz> But I dont mind seeing a new perspective IF there's a point
[0:11:50] <Josef_Stryker> I can't bring myself to be Renegade
[0:11:56] <%krispen_wa> Playing Evil in KOTOR I is the only way to play the game
[0:11:59] <Josef_Stryker> I can do Paragade at best
[0:12:05] <%Irridium> I don't want to make the imaginary people sad
[0:12:12] <%bumpynavel> Glorifying the badness
[0:12:12] <leith_aziz> Like, if im just an asshole for the sake of being an asshole. I cant do that
[0:12:13] <gfkxj> I wish games made being the bad guy more interesting, alot of the times doing the evil option is just more boring option of you killed everyone.
[0:12:20] <%eanscrale> The art direction is saying that the psychopath is just, and in fact not a bad person
[0:12:20] <iacus_> The Kratos tone
[0:12:21] <+coolthulhuu> I like being a hero :)
[0:12:22] <leith_aziz> Basically Fatalities and why I hate them
[0:12:33] <%khalcipher> Thats the problem i have with GTA
[0:12:35] <Picia000123> So, slave free chocolate, huh
[0:12:36] <andre11dr> I mean one of my favorite shows ever is Shin Getter Robo and the protagonist is OBJECTIVELY not a good person in that
[0:12:37] <Chatterbox1991> the difference between Spec Ops: the Line and God of War 3
[0:12:44] <iacus_> More like when the directos says "Yeah, it's a bad person, but that's badass!"
[0:12:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, the dolphin salt continues to be real
[0:12:46] <crunchington001> Dragon Age Origins is a great example of a game where you can play as an utter scumbag all the way through and still save the world
[0:12:55] <%krispen_wa> I did a renegade run of ME1 and ME2 and surprisingly its not too much different. its getting the same results in a more badass way. its ME3 renegade thats dumb
[0:13:05] <%dds333a> Woah
[0:13:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[0:13:07] <leith_aziz> Like Peak Example
[0:13:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> kratos is a dumb moron that causes problems cause waaah mee
[0:13:34] <leith_aziz> SOTL makes you feel like shit
[0:13:41] <%MightyDuckShoes> ARES!!!!
[0:13:42] <%DatAsuna> @krispen_wa ME1 renegade is you wanting a human fascist coup that dominates all other races, you just don't get it
[0:13:42] <AngryAsian5> My first playthrough of an RPG is usually as the ultra-good person. After that, my other playthroughs play around with morality more for funsies.
[0:13:50] <gfkxj> I was trying to make you into a great warrior.... YOU SUCCEDED
[0:13:52] <zanzibarian_hamster> You don't get CHEEVO UNLOCKED for firebombing all the civvies
[0:13:52] <Equirah> White Phsopherous! Wooooo \o/
[0:13:55] <WeepyDevil> spec ops doesn't give you cool willy pete comboes
[0:13:57] <leith_aziz> @CaptainPileDriver It's more to prove the issue with the GOW mythology gods
[0:14:01] <+illusiveSaint> i couldn't finish finish spec ops the gameplay was too generic for me but i respect the story
[0:14:02] <%illtima> Spec Ops doens't try to make you sympathize with Walker. Whatever they say about GoW3, they absolutely try to make Kratos likable with the whole Pandora thing
[0:14:07] <%DatAsuna> Funnily, while ash is way into that, Kaidan becomes that if you're renegade, then if you switch paragon he's very confused
[0:14:15] <%eanscrale> Light em all up!
[0:14:19] <+toastybites> Nero does skateboard tricks on a hellfire missile pointed at a wedding
[0:14:27] <OfficerMods> good guy kratos bringing hope to a broken world
[0:14:44] <+livingdynamo> plus spec ops shows you that walker is truly deranged
[0:14:47] <%DatAsuna> I don't play these games with my own morality. I get a read on the origin of the character like a writing prompt, and then I decide the morality of the character from there.
[0:14:48] <+livingdynamo> mannequin boss fight lmao
[0:14:55] <%dds333a> It won't
[0:14:57] <andre11dr> I'm don't have problems with having a immoral protagonist, but when i feel that the scene itself is immoral or in bad taste, that's when you lose me @woolieversus
[0:15:00] <linSP> choose your morals
[0:15:05] <%bumpynavel> I played "boring harry" in Disco. it's still really good and it was actually a really touching and sad story that way, even if it isn't as funny.
[0:15:19] <%dds333a> @bumpynavel true
[0:15:30] <leith_aziz> @illtima Well, that didnt work in the end cause Pandora died and at that point it was just Kratos being at peace with himself. The issue is that he came to that conclusion once he killed everything. AT least it ties into GOW 2018 well
[0:15:31] <WeepyDevil> yeah like...spartans are assholes, Kratos not having modern morality is fine
[0:15:35] <+Jiggisnipe> *stream breaks*
[0:15:39] <mrhappy6677> Ok so no jojolion spoilers got it
[0:15:39] <SivSarcast> And now I slep. Will catch the vod in the morning.
[0:15:48] <%krispen_wa> Destroy All Humans is the experience where you play as an asshole
[0:15:54] <%krispen_wa> the best experience
[0:15:59] <+mczarklesby> I think Deltarune is going to be a meta-narrative about the weight of expectation of making a follow up to Undertale.
[0:16:02] <WeepyDevil> but og kratos is incredibly fucking terrible even compared to historical spartans
[0:16:08] <JetpackMcQuack> big bombshell
[0:16:08] <OfficerMods> I played harry close to myself and got boring art cop. and boy is that dead on
[0:16:53] <leith_aziz> I'm the kinda guy who hates Fatalities because of what it represenets as the game trying REALLY hard to seem more "mature" than its competitors
[0:16:57] <AnneSQF> that reddit thread was a mess
[0:16:59] <dukenux> @weepydevil atleast he didn't diddle kids(afaik)
[0:17:08] <%wolfofsound> wolfofsound subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! In honor of my 23 months subbed I have my finger up my ass
[0:17:09] <leith_aziz> Also the fact that the devs get PTSD from the research
[0:17:12] <andre11dr> See that GoW shit i don't even think it was trying to be come of that fucked up , i think it was just trying to be edgy
[0:17:13] <%krispen_wa> there should have been a second wheel where kratos kills an evil dude at the same time to balance the door mechanism
[0:17:24] <he1lhydra> whaaaaat? people on the internet talking past eachother? impossible D:
[0:17:28] <OblivionSword1> hope it works
[0:17:34] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz it sure didn't always try to be serious.
[0:17:46] <heemwizard> wow you guys started a lot earlier this time
[0:17:52] <guiltyboya> gogogo
[0:17:56] <%krispen_wa> HARDCOOOOOORE
[0:17:57] <OfficerMods> I don't think ed boon puts fatalities in the game to be mature. I think he does it cuz its fucking sick
[0:18:02] <WeepyDevil> @dukenux he went to whorehouses, so even if he didn't pracisce pederastry, he probably didled kids, given the age of people who would be working at brothels in the historical equivalent to GoW's time
[0:18:05] <%TheotherKristian> No twitch help?
[0:18:06] <+Captain_Spicy_> HARDCORE TO THE MEGA
[0:18:09] <Saltmeisterr> heyo people
[0:18:12] <linSP> Dicks go elysium!
[0:18:14] <leith_aziz> GOW2 basically ended with Kratos declaring that he'll kill Zeus no matter who's in the way. But I still agree with your point that the devs went too far in some aspects
[0:18:14] <Saltmeisterr> whats happenin
[0:18:15] <linSP> Disco*
[0:18:16] <andre11dr> WELCOME TO REVACHOL

[0:39:31] <+askalta> gokus power pole
[0:39:35] <plsnolookatme> No, daredevil walks with stick, silly Wollie
[0:39:42] <dukenux> Night Trasher is an amazing superhero name
[0:39:50] <RyuuAoi> That one Guy....ummmm
[0:39:59] <Blackleafx> he buried you in encyclopedia
[0:40:04] <RyuuAoi> Nightwing
[0:40:06] <heemwizard> youll find out
[0:40:07] <plsnolookatme> Rhetoric was downright OFFENDED
[0:40:12] <heemwizard> in a couple weeks
[0:40:13] <plsnolookatme> that he didn't get a word in
[0:40:14] <Blackleafx> wompty dompty dom
[0:40:17] <+anoldtoilet> kim plays it close to the chest
[0:40:20] <+askalta> BEST thought in the game
[0:40:24] <Picia000123> get that thought pronto
[0:40:24] <+illusiveSaint> he beat you in rhetoric LUL
[0:40:25] <Blackleafx> He avoids the question anyhow if you ask him about Kim
[0:40:26] <dukenux> i mean, HE IS
[0:40:32] <Pt_Kamen> He's your HALF BROTHER
[0:40:33] <+cermo55> Wompty-Dompty Time
[0:40:37] <Blackleafx> DICK FUCKING MULLEN
[0:40:37] <DelgotHansto> Overpowered Thought
[0:40:40] <%krispen_wa> GOOD THOUGHT
[0:40:42] <dukenux> Kim the REAL Superstar Cop
[0:40:42] <Pt_Kamen> it was what authority said
[0:40:43] <Tiittamari> LUL LUL
[0:40:44] <skyenoz> it's probably better he does NOT know you
[0:40:44] <%eanscrale> yo that suit and loafers isn't the only thing that's green
[0:40:45] <+airchrysalis> Kim is probably the only Seolite RCM officer in Revachol
[0:40:46] <%Juriasu> he called you officers when you met
[0:40:49] <CinnamonAppleJacks> it's an insane thought
[0:40:49] <sushahana> low reaction speed
[0:40:52] <Blackleafx> this is encyclopedia stuff
[0:40:55] <andre11dr> Kim is just a baller like that
[0:40:56] <plsnolookatme> @Pt_Kamen do you think Woolie will ever figure out what Half Brother means in this context?
[0:41:03] <elshadow7> Good thought, but Woolie's Encyclopedia is not that high right?
[0:41:04] <+illusiveSaint> atpShh
[0:41:04] <zanzibarian_hamster> @airchrysalis Kim is from Revachol though
[0:41:08] <Blackleafx> @Odinhasnobooty what DOES it mean
[0:41:10] <Blackleafx> dm me
[0:41:15] <1miklu> this is a good one
[0:41:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1414834352052215808?s=19
[0:41:18] <heemwizard> get it
[0:41:19] <RyuuAoi> Nothing wrong with a little day drinking
[0:41:20] <+anoldtoilet> 42 minutes is good
[0:41:21] <heemwizard> its good
[0:41:22] <+cermo55> the best
[0:41:34] <andre11dr> Oh don't worry Woolie, Harry has been around LUL
[0:41:35] <Blackleafx> Head full
[0:41:36] <heemwizard> get rid of the ACTUAL ART DEGREE
[0:41:37] <%krispen_wa> its super good
[0:41:38] <Blackleafx> Many thoughts
[0:41:41] <+airchrysalis> @zanzibarian_hamster but his ancestors are not from Revakol
[0:41:44] <%khalcipher> You gotta be careful with what you choose
[0:41:44] <1miklu> superstar?
[0:41:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> Wompty dompty domp is the sound a drunk guy makes when walking in an old cartoon
[0:41:49] <+Jeshk0> everybody got make choooices
[0:41:54] <+anoldtoilet> this is like the advanced version of art degree
[0:41:55] <Pt_Kamen> @Odinhasnobooty nope, probably not even in the end game unless someone explains Esprit du corps
[0:41:56] <Blackleafx> @airchrysalis cringe
[0:41:58] <+anoldtoilet> its a whole art gallery
[0:41:59] <%wolfofsound> @zanzibarian_hamster nice
[0:42:01] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[0:42:03] <heysamuel> i would dump white mourning myself
[0:42:09] <RyuuAoi> Apoco Cop?
[0:42:09] <+rrratbastard> white mourning can go tbh
[0:42:16] <skyenoz> what does indotribe do again?
[0:42:20] <serioustguy> you dont really need wompty dom centere
[0:42:20] <+anoldtoilet> doesnt white mourning have some affect on the ending
[0:42:21] <elshadow7> White mourning probs
[0:42:21] <heemwizard> get rid of art degree
[0:42:23] <+Vivaciousx3> they dont raise the actual skill
[0:42:25] <Blackleafx> Should we tell Woolie that theres one thought he REALLY wants to get
[0:42:26] <andre11dr> Or you could just not internalize every thought you see, just saying
[0:42:27] <d41caesar> Yeah, White Mourning is the worst of these.
[0:42:29] <heemwizard> you need COMPOSURE
[0:42:30] <+anoldtoilet> those dont stay, yeah those caps go back down
[0:42:32] <Blackleafx> considering his playstyle
[0:42:41] <elshadow7> @heemwizard Art degree is H/E
[0:42:48] <plsnolookatme> @Pt_Kamen I have low expectations tbh. I remember when Pat told encyclopedia to f-off when it was about to explain the whole RCM/ICM origins
[0:42:53] <Blackleafx> bop
[0:42:59] <plsnolookatme> SO MUCH LORE so easily missed
[0:43:02] <Pt_Kamen> Esprit de Corps get a bit ignored unless it goes on long rants
[0:43:15] <dukenux> still doesnt look bad
[0:43:17] <%Juriasu> I don't think I've seen you zoom out even once, it is a cool thing to be able to do though
[0:43:36] <plsnolookatme> @Blackleafx which thought?
[0:43:51] <primaryfire> day 3 but only daytime
[0:43:52] <+askalta> I cant play the game without white mourning i got too used to it

[0:47:54] <%Dio_TR> Kappa
[0:47:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love when everyone is typing in caps and moobot snipes the one person who crosses the arbitrary number of capital letters
[0:47:58] <heemwizard> i can think of a couple of careers like that...
[0:47:58] <%Dio_TR> :)
[0:47:58] <plsnolookatme> Woolie better lay them pheromones on THICK
[0:48:03] <%holydeviant1> He's actually quite realistic on his field, it's refreshing
[0:48:07] <%Dio_TR> Yeah nothing at all :)
[0:48:07] <%MightyDuckShoes> What a Foolish Old Man!
[0:48:08] <Blackleafx> listen, the ghost hunter and finding bigfoot guys get paid a LOT of money
[0:48:09] <+airchrysalis> oh man..........
[0:48:13] <Pt_Kamen> peer review? what's that?
[0:48:15] <andre11dr> Woolie, people are literally out there hunting for Bigfoot
[0:48:16] <%Dio_TR> Kappa
[0:48:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:48:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Well some cryptozoologists work to debunk claims rather than prove them
[0:48:21] <kingra> Implying something is gonna happen is the same as spoilering it chat
[0:48:30] <%eanscrale> You might be surprised, the Gorilla was once considered a cryptid.
[0:48:38] <zanzibarian_hamster> There have been some confrimed cryptids, the kellas cat for one, though to be fair that's just a really big black cat in scotland
[0:48:49] <+anoldtoilet> thank you morell
[0:48:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> there are events in this game that have yet to occur
[0:48:53] <Blackleafx> @eanscrale A lot of creatures to be fair. Esp old fossilized ones
[0:48:56] <zhukis> phaaaaaaaaaasmid
[0:49:09] <+anoldtoilet> the fuckling worldbuilding and lore in this game are so good
[0:49:14] <Blackleafx> Coelacanths for instance
[0:49:24] <%wolfofsound> rock me phantasmada
[0:49:28] <+fugatlas> das an allllieeeeeen
[0:49:35] <+anoldtoilet> even stupid bugs that dont matter have cool lore
[0:49:38] <dukenux> i feel like cryptids is the least crazy of all the consoiracy stuff, still a bit silly
[0:49:39] <heysamuel> i would kill for more works in this universe (in english, i know about the book already)
[0:49:41] <Blackleafx> Evolved to protect against scientists
[0:49:49] <Blackleafx> PERSEPTION
[0:49:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> it makes you trip nuts
[0:49:58] <%vaderxyz1970> What country is Disco is Australia?
[0:49:59] <drunken_lemur> Electro-Chemical you say?
[0:50:02] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s a real thing at least
[0:50:05] <%Juriasu> he's just guessing in other words
[0:50:06] <+anoldtoilet> Estonia
[0:50:16] <spaceitaly> @vaderxyz1970 the krikeyan isola
[0:50:28] <sirrice77> @vaderxyz1970 No revachol isnt really a stand in for any actual country
[0:50:42] <Blackleafx> Revachol is A LOT of stuff
[0:50:49] <JetpackMcQuack> friend of a friend of a friend
[0:50:55] <%wolfofsound> ah yes unrefutably second and third hand accounts
[0:50:57] <Blackleafx> its post-soviet eastern europe by way of France
[0:51:13] <WeepyDevil> @wolfofsound he mentioned first hadn
[0:51:20] <%doomerskeletor13> His white whale
[0:51:22] <andre11dr> Now don't get me wrong, i don't believe that all cryptids are bullshit, but it's when where getting to bigfoot and Lochnes and shit like that ,that's when i start laughing at you
[0:51:34] <%Dio_TR> Kappa
[0:51:36] <%wolfofsound> @WeepyDevil I know but why mention the others?
[0:51:37] <%holydeviant1> ...oh, that line makes a lot more sense later.
[0:51:37] <dukenux> ^
[0:51:48] <+anoldtoilet> all conspiracy theory stuff is just harmless fun if i ts not about interpreting race statistics
[0:51:51] <justcallmebobplease> Man, if only Woolie can remember this when he gets to the ending portion
[0:51:58] <Blackleafx> @andre11dr loch ness is wild, its a tiny as fuck lake, no way something can hide there
[0:51:58] <Tiittamari> Kappa

[0:52:10] <Pt_Kamen> was inland empire ever wrong?
[0:52:12] <candidateplays> Revachol is New York, New Orleans, Singapore, Indonesia, Paris and parts of the old Warsaw Pact
[0:52:12] <Blackleafx> Pleeeeease
[0:52:14] <+Afrobrawler> relax guys
[0:52:17] <%holydeviant1> clear out the spoilers
[0:52:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> Apparently shit like gorilla, komodo dragon and platipus used to be (technically) cryptids
[0:52:29] <%vaderxyz1970> I though Lockness monster was whale dick?
[0:52:31] <a_bald_bro> shut up chat so annoying
[0:52:32] <Blackleafx> UM

[0:55:41] <%vaderxyz1970> Is light bending guy considered a Cryptid?
[0:55:46] <andre11dr> @pt_kamen But aren't all money imaginary
[0:55:57] <%doomerskeletor13> Gary is such a great idea for a character, because it’s true that these conspiracy fields often attract those type of people, or even radicalize them
[0:56:08] <Fuji808> @vaderxyz1970 Ultracapitalists are insects for sure.
[0:56:08] <zanzibarian_hamster> @vaderxyz1970 No, that's a confirmed scientific phenomenom in this universe
[0:56:18] <Pt_Kamen> @andre11dr why do you have to hurt me like that, with facts?

[0:56:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> 2 isn't wrong
[0:56:28] <%wolfofsound> 2 is so true

[0:56:52] <%vaderxyz1970> @drunken_lemur put mom on the phone
[0:56:58] <+ppangboi> I respect Morell's unwavering faith towards his field
[0:57:00] <OfficerMods> I wonder if this is a metaphor for anything in this very political video game
[0:57:03] <+anoldtoilet> perhaps you have yet to consider the interdimensional bigfoot theory
[0:57:13] <dinnydanny777> Quantum Bigfeet
[0:57:14] <mychael_bae> ??
[0:57:17] <heysamuel> i really like that answer tbh
[0:57:18] <Pt_Kamen> But not Peer Review
[0:57:21] <%eanscrale> It's not faith, he's doing real research here. Don't be rude
[0:57:30] <%wolfofsound> I saw bigfoot crushing cars at the state fair!
[0:57:35] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s a bit of faith involved
[0:57:51] <Blackleafx> ESTABLISHMENT

[0:58:25] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> Imagine following evidence from tabloids..

[0:58:39] <zanzibarian_hamster> Damn it did I miss Woolie talking to the cryptofascist?
[0:58:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> at least he's honest
[0:58:49] <Blackleafx> @zanzibarian_hamster nah
[0:58:51] <%wolfofsound> @zanzibarian_hamster no

[0:59:05] <+anoldtoilet> this is a solid track record
[0:59:08] <dinnydanny777> 2, damn that's 2 more than I expected
[0:59:17] <andre11dr> 2 ,we take that as a win
[0:59:22] <Blackleafx> @dukenux If you talk to her with Kim she will refer to him as a "different species"
[0:59:23] <dukenux> Kappa
[0:59:28] <skyenoz> the fact that they found 2 is commendable
[0:59:31] <Blackleafx> @dukenux then claim she meant it as a compliment
[0:59:35] <heemwizard> increase that number....
[0:59:35] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @blackleafx bruhhhh
[0:59:36] <%doomerskeletor13> I respect that

[0:59:59] <stadikt> lmao
[1:00:02] <dukenux> thats more than "casual" racism
[1:00:04] <+anoldtoilet> yis

[1:00:38] <%khalcipher> This chat honestly need more moderation
[1:00:39] <+askalta> stop making me look bad by association

[1:00:40] <WeepyDevil> woolie is in fact capable of reading implications idiots
[1:00:40] <Blackleafx> There was 1guy spoiling
[1:00:42] <+Afrobrawler> spoilers from before
[1:00:42] <+anoldtoilet> woolie is like 15 minutes behind but yea people keep talking about the ending
[1:00:43] <spaghettiweaver> what did you do chat?
[1:00:44] <+coolthulhuu> this chat is always cringe during disco streams
[1:00:52] <+coolthulhuu> seriously woolie needs a mod
[1:00:53] <%wolfofsound> We really need mods for the Disco streams
[1:00:53] <RyuuAoi> Thanks chat....you're dong good sweetie
[1:00:58] <OfficerMods> YOU are cringe
[1:00:59] <%MightyDuckShoes> Woolie also could have gone emote mode.
[1:01:01] <a_bald_bro> 0 iq chat thinking woolie cant read their subtext
[1:01:13] <%wolfofsound> @MightyDuckShoes wow how fund would that be all stream
[1:01:14] <kingra> Implying stuff is spoiling
[1:01:15] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> woolie does need a couple mods to wrangle in the wilder ones
[1:01:17] <%wolfofsound> fun*
[1:01:18] <%doomerskeletor13> Cryptozoologist Cop
[1:01:26] <Pt_Kamen> BRATAN!

[1:01:32] <+anoldtoilet> ah, the irish
[1:01:34] <ingman112> @wolfofsound Better that than rampant spoiling. It worked for Pat's ending stream
[1:01:35] <dinnydanny777> Tree people
[1:01:35] <iacus_> Hmm I missed the chat thing
[1:01:37] <%Lion_kun> Who spoiled!?!
[1:01:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Willow, the hit movie from George Lucas?
[1:01:40] <+KingGilbertIV> It's not like chat's a mess or anything, one mod could have dealt with that
[1:01:48] <zanzibarian_hamster> Fucking treants, sick
[1:01:51] <dukenux> Ents?
[1:01:53] <elshadow7> Emote mode and mods are good and all, but chat not being pricks would be the actual solution
[1:01:55] <gunsrlove> Akuda was a mod, where she at
[1:01:55] <%wolfofsound> @ingman112 @MightyDuckShoes oh for parts of the stream sure, but all stream? We just need one mod
[1:01:55] <andre11dr> Like that one Lovecraft thing
[1:01:58] <+anoldtoilet> the phaaasmid
[1:02:01] <RyuuAoi> Woolie want us to be able to have fun without mods. It's called self control

[1:02:28] <ingman112> Shit I'll mod it up, I don't give a fuck. You see a spoiler, ban the person
[1:02:29] <dukenux> LUL
[1:02:30] <+anoldtoilet> it might have been non toxic
[1:02:31] <OblivionSword1> POLLUTION FOR SCIENCE
[1:02:32] <dinnydanny777> Poisoning the wildlife to find Bigfoot
[1:02:32] <%krispen_wa> @elshadow7 you think the evil apes duking over a disco ball can moderate THEMSELVES?
[1:02:33] <ingman112> Seems pretty simple to me
[1:02:36] <andre11dr> FOR SCIENCE
[1:02:39] <primaryfire> I fucking hate people who think they're slick by implying spoilers
[1:02:40] <+anoldtoilet> anyone who volunteers to be a mod should never be a mod
[1:02:42] <+Tuffty> From what I saw, someone asked a question and then someone else just outright spoiled something big in response to it
[1:02:42] <%wolfofsound> @MightyDuckShoes because it happens ALL stream
[1:02:44] <+anoldtoilet> thats like a hard internet rule
[1:02:47] <RyuuAoi> @vaderxyz1970 This is America...
[1:02:48] <heysamuel> kim lmfao

[1:03:08] <ingman112> @anoldtoilet If we followed that rule there would be no mods

[1:03:12] <+froduck42> "and they came boundin ovah"
[1:03:19] <%vaderxyz1970> Use Pestasides to find the Phasmid if all bugs are dead it should be only one left right?
[1:03:20] <+Tuffty> Maybe just appreciate that people watching Woolie play are also experiencing it for the first time too.
[1:03:23] <stardustcrusad3r> based kim dabbing on cryptoloonies
[1:03:24] <dukenux> @doomerskeletor13 "a tiny net is unbeatable"
[1:03:24] <mychael_bae> they might have painted a camouflaged bug
[1:03:25] <elshadow7> @krispen_wa Oh, perish the thought! I'm just saying it's silly to say it's Woolie's or the mod's fault
[1:03:33] <Blackleafx> YES
[1:03:35] <+anoldtoilet> no, you just trust woolie or minh or someone to pick someone who can do it and stop backseat modding
[1:03:36] <heysamuel> of course you do!
[1:03:43] <+illusiveSaint> there needs to be some public execution revolutionary style in the chat just to make a point LUL
[1:03:44] <+anoldtoilet> anyway i want to pay attention to this!
[1:03:45] <primaryfire> pursuing falsifiability is respectable
[1:03:47] <brisk_dacat> what else you gotta do
[1:03:48] <dinnydanny777> Is he being gnomes
[1:03:50] <heysamuel> it's only 8.30am, plenty of time to psychoanalyze this guy

[1:03:53] <drunken_lemur> Man!
[1:03:56] <%MightyDuckShoes> @wolfofsound it's a toggle. it can be flipped on and off midstream. people do it all the time

[1:06:55] <FassieFons> any moose that kills a human gets promoted to a dread moose
[1:07:01] <+Mendin> Vasa is also the dynasty name of some of the Swedish kings

[1:07:27] <+dalmek> the dread moose is just a moose that learned of war

[1:09:13] <@Solidus_113> hey demons, it's me ya boy
[1:09:13] <+anoldtoilet> the thing is youre playing a game in a setting where theres magic white mist that erases reality and memories and compresses time like final fantasy 8

[4:20:42] <iacus_> don't burn Hollywood what did they do to you
[4:20:44] <ingman112> There's something to be said both for societal pressure and for the need for change to come from within
[4:20:46] <heemwizard> there should be some extra...
[4:20:48] <%teefpal> The dark side to Electrochemistry
[4:20:48] <dinnydanny777> The music industry also needs to burn tbh
[4:20:50] <heemwizard> or did he fail a check

[4:22:36] <dukenux> Forget it Kim, it's MArtinaise
[4:22:39] <dinnydanny777> Just like that part in resident evil
[4:22:47] <Dopamien> electrochem liked that*
[4:22:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> and the fascists
[4:22:48] <ingman112> And the people you work for, to an extent
[4:22:50] <$JobbedBone> well this is a very impovershed area
[4:22:55] <iacus_> there are drugs and drugs
[4:22:57] <OfficerMods> or another insola
[4:22:59] <heemwizard> eh it is a much poorer part of revachol
[4:23:01] <iacus_> just like irl
[4:23:09] <%vaderxyz1970> I forget is Joyce pro drugs?

[4:24:32] <%Gruhunchously> Kappa
[4:24:34] <%DashXero> Measurehead hates drugs too.
[4:24:37] <sirrice77> Measurehead probably doesnt like drugs like he doesnt like Al Ghul
[4:24:47] <$JobbedBone> their material science is far ahead of ours
[4:24:52] <dinnydanny777> I feel like the whole carriage would bounce if you went over a stone
[4:25:01] <%teefpal> basically only dirty commies, moralists, ultralibs, and normal people use drugs
[4:25:23] <%krispen_wa> and also one fuck up named harry du bois
[4:25:36] <%Gruhunchously> Revakol Forever

[4:27:10] <sirrice77> @the_angelon_experience pretty sure its just radio but with people serving certain functions programs would here
[4:27:12] <%teefpal> @the_angelon_experience It's more like ARPANET at this stage of development

[4:27:42] <+airchrysalis> we not doin church today eh

[4:47:11] <dewwy125> 1
[4:47:14] <heemwizard> dont mention 5
[4:47:16] <%Gruhunchously> Not 5
[4:47:16] <1miklu> 4
[4:47:21] <iacus_> 4 is solid
[4:47:21] <a_bald_bro> 4 obviously
[4:47:26] <OfficerMods> I don't understand how this theory holds water, the gunshot would be audible from the roof
[4:47:42] <heemwizard> @OfficerMods yeah the game mentions it later
[4:48:02] <OfficerMods> but they are acting like it's even plausible
[4:48:08] <sirrice77> 2
[4:48:13] <dewwy125> maybe they didnt hear
[4:48:13] <ingman112> 1 and 2 both seem good
[4:48:21] <heemwizard> say 1 then move on with 6
[4:48:22] <meatman_noplan> 2 would fit really well if the guns are military
[4:48:24] <iacus_> you can move on
[4:48:40] <iacus_> you messed up

[4:49:05] <ingman112> @diddlerriddler Not yet, we'll get there
[4:49:07] <%Juriasu> oh my god I love this game
[4:49:11] <heemwizard> the game is very forgiving
[4:49:31] <dukenux> ONE more thing...
[4:49:32] <BurdRightsActivist> MUSHROOMED DEATHBRINGER
[4:49:35] <diddlerriddler> ok I'm just worried he's going to rush the main plot
[4:49:36] <kingra> Fat neutral...
[4:49:45] <heemwizard> say 1 and move on
[4:49:50] <dreamfillah> we good
[4:49:53] <%DiscoMatador> good
[4:49:56] <heemwizard> or not
[4:49:58] <codymagpie> 1 and 5
[4:49:58] <a_bald_bro> 1 seems kinda dumb
[4:50:00] <ingman112> @diddlerriddler Chat will let him know before he hits the point of no return
[4:50:05] <%Gruhunchously> @diddlerriddler Doesn't the game warn you when you're about to hit the point of no return?
[4:50:17] <a_bald_bro> aaand it was dumb
[4:50:32] <heemwizard> not entirely
[4:50:36] <zanzibarian_hamster> Any sentence starting with "all i'm saying", is asking for trouble
[4:50:38] <heemwizard> just not 3 and 5
[4:50:50] <%mariothemaio> @diddlerriddler it does
[4:50:59] <dreamfillah> so cool
[4:51:00] <zanzibarian_hamster> Nothing good comes from "all i'm saying"
[4:51:02] <%mariothemaio> warn at the point of no return that is
[4:51:20] <linSP> look man, I’m just saying those al-behds
[4:51:39] <heemwizard> yeah thats right
[4:52:07] <Johannen> 2 has some good Titus info
[4:52:09] <iacus_> wömen intüition
[4:52:33] <%SomeAsianDood> It's a shame they didn't embrace an Inexplicable Feminist Agenda
[4:52:36] <BurdRightsActivist> Dont think 2 has anything, you can just skip it 4Head
[4:52:39] <marcomatame> What's Alain's accent from? He sounds Spanish/Italian but very thick
[4:52:58] <heemwizard> @SomeAsianDood they were too far into the game for that
[4:52:59] <Dopamien> she has a good shit compressor
[4:53:00] <iacus_> Sounds close to spanish yes
[4:53:13] <1miklu> 2 sounds good
[4:53:15] <%SomeAsianDood> @heemwizard i know the check is literally when the talk with Garte on the first day
[4:53:28] <heemwizard> yea was a hilarious check too
[4:53:38] <heemwizard> they would skip the cock carousel thing tho
[4:53:48] <heemwizard> if they had the thought
[4:53:52] <BurdRightsActivist> REALLY??
[4:53:57] <Reveresao> 2

[5:09:44] <%Irridium> oh so me with games as a service
[5:09:51] <primaryfire> I kept myself from playing mafia 2 because I always heard it ends on a cliffhanger
[5:09:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:10:01] <vonmaultke> punitive FOMO LUL It hurts you for failing
[5:10:08] <dreamfillah> lowkey
[5:10:11] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Want to know what you missed under the 2 with that Ruby talk?
[5:10:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> only 1000 episodes
[5:10:14] <Jolly_Adventurer> You can but you miss on hype moments
[5:10:14] <%vaderxyz1970> Getting the S20 when the S21 is anouced next day :(
[5:10:16] <%wolfofsound> OP is gonna have an ending unlike berserk PepeHands
[5:10:18] <%DashXero> Reggie, you're missing out on one of the best stories. Period.
[5:10:21] <dukenux> lemme just catch up with 900 episodes
[5:10:21] <%thedankestmeeme> ONE PIECE IS DOPE AS F
[5:10:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> bang it out in a week or two
[5:10:23] <lotharrio> You could like... watch some of the movies, I guess? Would give you an idea of how it goes.
[5:10:24] <+Meathands> "Yeah I bet it is. a THOUSAND fuckin' episodes though?"
[5:10:30] <Iandrasil> it's a great journey
[5:10:38] <dreamfillah> One Piece is super worth it
[5:10:40] <Prevot> I'd say don't get into Berserk until... recently. Now at least you KNOW for sure there will be no end
[5:10:44] <andre11dr> Well Disco Elysium is nothing but FOMO every second
[5:10:47] <Iandrasil> one piece is probably the best written shounen manga
[5:10:49] <%DashXero> One Piece hasn't tripped up yet.
[5:10:49] <primaryfire> visible seams
[5:10:50] <dreamfillah> Oh yeah, youll spot the patterns but
[5:10:51] <%thedankestmeeme> I caught up in 3-4 months ez clap all day one piece
[5:10:52] <%wolfofsound> True
[5:10:57] <andre11dr> Yep
[5:10:59] <the_angelon_experience> the manga is cool but the anime got good only at Wano
[5:11:00] <%wolfofsound> You don't read it for the formula tho
[5:11:02] <%jinking79> there some fights in ippo i want to see animated
[5:11:11] <Ziegsy> If I cant platinum a game it puts me off playing
[5:11:11] <lotharrio> 1000 episodes. ~18 minutes an episode or ~7 minutes a chapter. Realistically you could get through it in about... three months at a reasonable pace.
[5:11:15] <dreamfillah> But fact is One Piece maintains a quality between decent to GREAT throughout
[5:11:16] <Iandrasil> the anime is a thorough meh, one pace is better fixes the awful pacing
[5:11:18] <%thedankestmeeme> BRO I love the music in the background sounds clean
[5:11:22] <andre11dr> Actually it turns out to be worth it
[5:11:31] <iacus_> what is 1000 episodes? I missed the start of the convo
[5:11:32] <%teefpal> Any long running thing gets super exhausting for me
[5:11:35] <dreamfillah> U WIN
[5:11:37] <%Tearonex> I bet Luffy is going to punch the badguy and win LUL
[5:11:43] <%wolfofsound> I chose wisely
[5:11:44] <nelsonsaysbooya> The nice thing about long series is you can drink greedily until you are caught up
[5:11:48] <codymagpie> cdi zelda: I won
[5:11:54] <andre11dr> It just that it has world building only rivalled by Tolkien
[5:11:56] <Prevot> I chose all three and dropped Naruto and Bleach long before they ended
[5:11:58] <%wolfofsound> yeah that'll end Kappa
[5:12:00] <%teefpal> The Trails series is another good example of a long-running series that is just SO LONG
[5:12:02] <%DashXero> Watching someone fresh get into One Piece is the greatest feeling on the internet.
[5:12:04] <%krispen_wa> WHENS GON IN A MINUTE WOOLIE?!
[5:12:05] <dreamfillah> What was that
[5:12:10] <%Irridium> Gintama the true king
[5:12:11] <iacus_> Oh One Piece
[5:12:11] <%thedankestmeeme> bingeing one piece felt so gud
[5:12:25] <%jinking79> no one reads Bourto
[5:12:30] <dreamfillah> Mihawk
[5:12:32] <Prevot> honestly getting into HxH is a way worse deal cause that shit will never get an ending
[5:12:41] <iacus_> I keep hearing One Piece is good but, man it's so off-puttingly ugly that I can't bring myself to watch it
[5:12:43] <andre11dr> One Piece has some cool stuff
[5:12:46] <%teefpal> Garwsh
[5:12:51] <codymagpie> maybe goofy is cool :(
[5:12:51] <%krispen_wa> get into hxh and just think the anime ending is the real ending
[5:12:51] <%DashXero> The goofy loops around to become cool.
[5:12:52] <andre11dr> Woolie would love Kaido
[5:12:55] <Jolly_Adventurer> One Piece is like 70% goofy shit
[5:12:55] <%thedankestmeeme> ZORO Is the most serious guy tho unironically
[5:12:59] <Prevot> motherfucker you used to watch wrestling
[5:13:02] <Johannen> I feel the same kind of energy from Devil May Cry, goofy can be Cool
[5:13:05] <dreamfillah> @iacus_ it's brimming with personality and creativitu tho
[5:13:05] <Jolly_Adventurer> And we love it for it
[5:13:06] <meatman_noplan> Kaido's design is pretty cool.
