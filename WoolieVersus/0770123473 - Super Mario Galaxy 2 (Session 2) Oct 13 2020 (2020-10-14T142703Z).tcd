[0:08:01] <DianaTheAscian> making myself is weird
[0:08:05] <andre11dr> Wat is this?I missed the podcast so don't know
[0:08:05] <+Beniial> Galaxy 2 has better level design anyway :-)
[0:08:06] <prime_name> I'd fuck hot me
[0:08:07] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:08:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie knows what’s up
[0:08:17] <+JustToWatch> sub category of trying to make yourself then giving up halfway through
[0:08:17] <+chosenjuan42> Galaxy 2 is very fun
[0:08:17] <+guynormus69> reggie is into feet AND selfcest
[0:08:25] <bbblaketwitching> is this after stream?

[0:09:08] <+Dova573> How dare you call me a generic hero character Kappa
[0:09:11] <%Solidnick18> generic bald man is my favorite
[0:09:12] <ChansonNoire> all non human races in bg3 clip through everything, they didnt adjust the cutscenes for their models, so just pick hyur Kappa
[0:09:18] <%doomerskeletor13> I’m just surprised the character looked cohesive rather than horrific
[0:09:23] <@Menitta> I put way too much time into Code Vein's CAC
[0:09:24] <%ImFlippinOut> ImFlippinOut subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! do you miss the simple machinima days?
[0:09:28] <TallPixels> Default White Man in smash when?
[0:09:36] <DianaTheAscian> the presets in monhun world aren't that bad
[0:09:41] <+Walopoh> This is all alien talk
[0:09:50] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Since I play Honey Select. Character creation is something I Usuallt spend hours on
[0:09:51] <andre11dr> I actually have the same thing as Woolie where i just make edgy female version of me
[0:09:53] <+Walopoh> Poor Reggie being indoctrinated
[0:09:54] <+Dhamilt> Bland af
[0:09:57] <+deviljhojho_> dnd players love their white bread human fighters
[0:10:01] <%doomerskeletor13> Inside baseball talk
[0:10:01] <@Menitta> MHW's CAC also looks amazing in cutscene which is hard to pull off
[0:10:02] <+deviljhojho_> its pretty embarassing
[0:10:09] <TallPixels> @BallerSwagBro9k A man of culture
[0:10:14] <+chosenjuan42> Paul Marketing
[0:10:18] <DaKnightWarrior> Made it.
[0:10:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @TallPixels BasedGod
[0:10:35] <+deviljhojho_> w-was paul marketing right all along?
[0:10:38] <DianaTheAscian> sounds very bland if thats the majority of dnd characters
[0:10:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie will slowly become not a normie
[0:10:56] <@Menitta> "I wanna be a human fighter"
[0:10:59] <glaciusinfinite> Whoever says Human fighters are bland, I will Action Surge IRL
[0:11:05] <+deviljhojho_> "i hit it with my sword"

[0:11:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Generic Troy Baker man
[0:11:32] <Darren716> The whole point of box art is to sell copies though
[0:11:39] <DaKnightWarrior> NotLikeThis eeeh
[0:11:40] <lovebass4stuff> Sexism
[0:11:40] <@akuda_bar> that's why you make reversible covers
[0:11:44] <+picante_papi> @Walopoh atpLaw atpWind
[0:11:48] <+deviljhojho_> reversible covers are the real covers tbh

[0:12:25] <+Walopoh> Paul Marketing vindicated
[0:12:26] <ChansonNoire> an average will always make a generic blob anyway
[0:12:27] <+deviljhojho_> is that so much to ask
[0:12:32] <CocoonMoon> Is this a new playthrough?
[0:12:36] <%faeron93> and yet generic hero is what people seem to want

[0:13:05] <+deviljhojho_> It does make sense, tho. Forgotten realms is the most generic setting for the most generic tabletop games, so most of its fans would make something generic

[0:14:25] <+guynormus69> it is my constitutional right to play this game as generic male

[0:55:47] <DaKnightWarrior> the goombas are learning.
[0:55:58] <Darren716> You can jump on them when theyre flipped
[0:55:59] <+cdrom321> Spin and then jump on them.
[0:56:00] <%Invlux> that's not a goomba... those eyes... monkaS
[0:56:08] <leomuratore> HE DED

[0:57:01] <+chosenjuan42> hold fire
[0:57:10] <+PapaGravestone> ok but whens there gonna be a colony drop of the starship mario tho?
[0:57:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> PLAY THROUGH RUINED
[0:57:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[0:57:33] <DaKnightWarrior> THAT'S TOO MUCH POWER
[0:57:33] <+guynormus69> any 3D mario maker would be welcome
[0:57:33] <JigsK> are there rom hacks for galaxy?
[0:57:35] <%Prevot> more tips for 4 year olds
[0:57:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that'd be fuckin insane
[0:57:45] <DerpioParty> You can see that luma pop out of Mario and then come back in before you can spin again
[0:57:45] <Darren716> the babby tv
[0:58:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> Mario Universe
[0:58:02] <andre11dr> I would to se the pov of a goomba as Mario approaches, it would be some Gundam Thunderbolt shit with the levels of fear
[0:58:18] <%Prevot> these goombas look diseased
[0:58:23] <+jessedouglas> this clips will be played when that get's revealed... eventually.
[0:58:25] <+Beniial> even just Mario Galaxy in regular Mario Maker would probably be sick
[0:58:29] <+linSP> the spin in galaxy gave mario so much needed recovery
[0:58:31] <thatsocrunchy> Let’s just hope for that in Mario galaxy 3, if that ever gets made Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:58:37] <DianaTheAscian> prob
[0:58:40] <bigshedman> Could've at least added some 2D galaxy elements, like the level you played before with a bunch of gravity-changing.
[0:58:53] <wibbwobbler> personally not against it

However I've always been curious, how come when you joined Twitter, people sent you gross animal facts? p.s. I tweeted how aphids are born pregnant. Got a retweet for that one!

[1:02:46] <+guynormus69> @beniial holy shit you're right, dragon driftway is based on him
[1:02:54] <+guynormus69> never noticed
[1:02:56] <%gregiidge> Vore has been ingrained in us from the start of history
[1:02:57] <bigshedman> @metabot64 The Gamecube games felt like Nintendo was pushing more of a narrative with Sunshine and Luigi's Mansion, but I guess they either just dropped it or it got too much negative response.
[1:02:59] <%Mr_Strut> vore facts
[1:03:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Except the Anaconda ussualy strnagles it prey 1st

[1:04:54] <andre11dr> Mario is becoming the Starforge
[1:04:57] <WG101> SMG1's ending is just diebuster's ending
[1:04:58] <+MeatBomb> Caver spelunkers are crazy.
[1:05:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> The more innocent a game is the more depraved the commentary gets. its a common theme with LPs i wonder if it was a trope on tvtropes yet

[1:36:13] <Jaxnos> Reggie just making out with his Lum buddies over there
[1:36:14] <Darren716> Now for the best power up in the game
[1:36:24] <%Solidnick18> boulder bowl yeee
[1:36:37] <Darren716> SourPls
[1:36:38] <@Menitta> Its much closer to 3D Land/World
[1:36:53] <Darren716> Galaxy 1 had lot more in depth levels
[1:36:53] <dreadedcthulhu> very much a course style game vs a 3d style game
[1:36:56] <+Beniial> This is where their design style kind of started
[1:36:59] <+Rekinsinn> @WoolieVersus Funny you call it a half-step when it's name is internally Super Mario Galaxy 1.5
[1:36:59] <%TheLemuroid> Course clear vs sandbox
[1:37:03] <%Prevot> Glaxy 1 was already that
[1:37:10] <Darren716> Since they would have 6 stars each for the major galaxies
[1:37:13] <DerpioParty> It is pretty clear if you play them in order how things progressed from 64 to 3D World
[1:37:15] <+DrDenorax> Oh they busted out the Wii?
[1:37:20] <Jaxnos> rock and roll, baybee
[1:37:22] <+firmlygraspi1> I just noticed the similarity between Toad and Patty & Selma
[1:37:28] <@Menitta> Galaxy 1 had some exploration levels like Beach Bowl and Honey Hive
[1:37:31] <+guynormus69> 3d world is the "planetoids" of galaxy 2 mixed with the "2d mario in 3d" of 3d land
[1:37:34] <Darren716> Hit the crystal

[2:06:29] <+guynormus69> @ballerswagbro9k it's a different zelda every time, so id say peach
[2:06:30] <Cynical_Canadian> @BallerSwagBro9k I think Peach since she even lampshades it at times
[2:06:35] <+chosenjuan42> Tec has the hook uos
[2:06:38] <andre11dr> She's more like a concubine
[2:06:38] <DerpioParty> Bowser's a nice guy when you get to know him

[2:06:51] <DaKnightWarrior> Bowsers a good dad.
[2:06:53] <+IceyCone> Peach has been kidnapped more but she actually does stuff when kidnapped, zelda's always trapped
[2:06:54] <dreamfillah> I remember the summer this came out when I was 13; so carefree and fun. 😊
[2:07:09] <DaKnightWarrior> Love this level.

[2:45:35] <+chosenjuan42> SUNSHINE EEL
[2:45:39] <andyfutrell> if jump accuracy is a problem for wooile than near the end of the game will be really hard for him
[2:45:50] <Kain5707> the piano

[3:37:08] <ULTRA__64> nicobBang
[3:37:09] <+chosenjuan42> ok sorry Modbot
[3:37:11] <%Prevot> yeah but fuck playing the whole game all over as Luigi, that's garbo
[3:37:15] <powerprotoman> because your crazy got it
[3:37:16] <$Ralfclogs> Replays?
[3:37:17] <+Walopoh> I thought you just have to beat the ending?
[3:37:20] <Nomad94> I thought it was fun
[3:37:25] <+AwkwardSnails> What about DMC?
[3:37:26] <+arancet> you gotta choose how to spend your time
[3:37:28] <Darren716> Nah you need to get all 120 as Mario
[3:37:37] <Tuna_Can_0> idk thats pretty normal imo
[3:37:40] <Darren716> Then if you get 120 as Luigi you get the final galaxy
[3:37:42] <+cdrom321> There are too many games in the world to replay anything.
[3:37:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BLAST HARDER
[3:37:55] <ULTRA__64> Too many good games
[3:37:56] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 24/7 STREAMS
[3:38:03] <Darren716> You can get through all of galaxy as luigi in like 5 hours though
[3:38:04] <andre11dr> Just do whatever
[3:38:14] <Zebroneath> The Luigi playthrough in Galaxy 1 has little differences, save for the way Luigi controls.
[3:38:17] <Nomad94> If you've had some time to let the first playthrough sit, it's fun to come back to it in a new way
[3:38:17] <+jiggy_snipe> naw Woolie just play everything Kappa three times
[3:38:19] <%emperordread> It's a lame smash character taking up a slot
[3:38:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> no you have to 100% everything flawlessly and have your finger on the pulse of the mainstream
[3:38:29] <CollinCoyKoi> Shit, man, that's just what my brain yells at itself internally LUL
[3:38:43] <styx_highway> How bout that RAP career with VMills some more?
[3:38:55] <styx_highway> Would like more Woolie Metal.
[3:39:19] <CollinCoyKoi> Except for New Vegas. I replay it once every year and never get tired of it, tbh.
[3:39:19] <%TheLemuroid> Some of us get it
[3:39:23] <+arancet> its cool woolz, when exposed to the internet like this, you can do no right
[3:39:23] <+Harro8> dont need to explain yourself man
[3:39:24] <Nomad94> It's also the perception that you might not have liked a game all that much "if you won't even play it again"
[3:39:27] <andre11dr> I don't know, i would watch Woolie coach Reggie threw Bloodborne
[3:39:28] <powerprotoman> woolie tries too hard to please the faceless masses
[3:39:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Theres only a handful of games is actually replay
[3:39:32] <Nomad94> even if you loved it
[3:39:34] <+chosenjuan42> I get it
[3:39:39] <+jiggy_snipe> do both Kappa all the recommendations and playing things twice
[3:39:43] <Darren716> Man i've lost count how many times i've replayed SMG 1 and 2
[3:39:47] <+TheNewZealandStory> @andre11dr they would never make progress
[3:39:47] <@akuda_bar> woolsplaining
[3:40:03] <ShiningAxis> Personally, I play one game every three months and shelve a thousand other games until the end of time
[3:40:04] <powerprotoman> woolie you jsut said you felt it was a waste fo time
[3:40:08] <Gc478xf> CoolCat DxCat CoolCat
[3:40:13] <+chosenjuan42> Getting into FIGHTCRAB for fun!
[3:40:16] <+chosenjuan42> lol
[3:40:19] <Nomad94> If it's a game I played for the story, you'd have to bribe me to play it again if I've seen the true ending
[3:40:20] <ShiningAxis> but I'm totally gonna play everything
[3:40:21] <Darren716> Hell I'm literally replaying SMG2 right now, started after the first stream and I'm like half way through green stars now
[3:40:27] <heartlesshealer> 🦀🦀🦀
[3:40:29] <andyfutrell> what if you have to beat a game twice to unlock a secret super boss @woolieversus
[3:40:35] <styx_highway> Needs more Woolie Metal with VMills.
[3:40:44] <%Terrarp> would you consider new versions of an already played game like the new version of Nier original?
[3:40:56] <DianaTheAscian> do u ever worry that everything u consume will sometimes just be a blur?
[3:41:09] <andre11dr> "Souls is just generic fantasy" Remember those days
[3:41:17] <+jiggy_snipe> I think Woolie views different versions to be different games kinda
[3:41:17] <+chosenjuan42> It's super rare to find someone who hasn't played Mario games. So it's super hype to know you never played Paper Marios
[3:41:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> EVERY GAME WHEN?
[3:41:24] <%Farples> I understand that, even as someone who tries to 100% games I tend not to go back to a lot of them. At the same time though I also do a yearly replay through the entire KH franchise cause I have fond memories
[3:41:28] <styx_highway> Souls is over rated.
[3:41:31] <%Prevot> I enjoy coming back to games after a long time and replaying, but what I don't really enjoy is going through the same game in a harder difficulty, which hurts my enjoyment of character action games
[3:41:34] <+cdrom321> I try not to dwell on a game too long because then I'll never get through my game library.
[3:41:37] <Nomad94> Woolie, [insert game] when?
[3:41:41] <Slim_Lipid> They are generic fantasy tho
[3:41:41] <CaptainTitforce> consoom
[3:41:50] <styx_highway> I still think souls is over rated.
[3:41:56] <heartlesshealer> willing to embrace speed
[3:41:57] <Zayasu> yeah its not generic its just stupid Kappa
[3:42:04] <Nomad94> I freaking hate how the souls games play
[3:42:11] <Applecannon63> Stupid fun
[3:42:11] <powerprotoman> remember when you thought gacha was just collecting jpegs with no gameplay, and now you play teppen
[3:42:14] <+valiard> Super mario ?
[3:42:17] <+chosenjuan42> Woolie [Fight Crab] when?
[3:42:17] <+jiggy_snipe> meh
[3:42:22] <styx_highway> I rather have another Lost Planet game like Lost Planet 2
[3:42:30] <styx_highway> Rather have a new Crimson Skies
[3:42:32] <Supabait> souls is overrated nowadays but at the time they were way ahead of the curve
[3:42:34] <styx_highway> Or MotorStorm
[3:42:35] <Applecannon63> Souls gave you punch builds
[3:42:46] <ggbhtg> @powerprotoman Teppen isn't impossible to get cards in tho
[3:42:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:42:54] <DianaTheAscian> @powerprotoman now he throws jpegs at jpegs
[3:42:55] <+chosenjuan42> Crabs are just organic Mechas
[3:42:58] <heartlesshealer> @powerprotoman you say that, but every TCG (as opposed to TTCG's) is just gacha
[3:42:59] <Applecannon63> and kusanagi fireballs
[3:43:14] <powerprotoman> @heartlesshealer Exactly
[3:43:18] <ULTRA__64> true
[3:43:22] <ggbhtg> Teppen is impossible because of the RPS of the top meta, not cuz you can't get cards
[3:43:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BUT DO IT THO L
[3:43:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:43:29] <@akuda_bar> that's a good name lol
[3:43:30] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:43:34] <ggbhtg> Plague no Jutsu
[3:43:45] <Tuna_Can_0> WutFace
[3:43:48] <+chosenjuan42> Plague
[3:43:49] <CollinCoyKoi> I never thought I'd enjoy Persona as much as I did until I tried it. Sales definitely help with expanding personal horizons.
[3:43:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THE PLAGUE EFFECT
[3:43:50] <Applecannon63> dammit Plague
[3:43:52] <andre11dr> But play Kirby super Star Ultra tho ,no really do it ,DO IT YIU COWARD
[3:43:59] <Darren716> Oh yeah i think Matt and Pat said in a play through to send them to you
[3:44:08] <Darren716> When you first got twitter
[3:44:14] <Darren716> I think it was during RE4
[3:44:14] <CaptainTitforce> oh yeah ballistic duck penises
[3:44:16] <+jiggy_snipe> yea they probably did in an LP
[3:44:22] <heartlesshealer> And then everyone fell down the nature hole of oddities
[3:44:24] <ggbhtg> This is SBF x YOVG tech: Send all this horrible stuff....TO ANOTHER PERSON IN THE GROUP Kappa
[3:44:35] <+chosenjuan42> Previous bit
[3:44:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> wat?
[3:44:46] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[3:44:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:44:54] <%BinaryFireball> did frank take out the babies?
[3:44:54] <Daxalog> Baby is Armor Class 0
[3:44:56] <+BionicPulga> Wut
[3:44:57] <+jiggy_snipe> comics are so dumb, it's great LUL
[3:44:59] <ggbhtg> dats comix
[3:45:00] <Supabait> we're talking comics right?
[3:45:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAH,HAPPUN?
[3:45:08] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[3:45:12] <+chosenjuan42> BABY ARMOR
[3:45:15] <heartlesshealer> remember baby armor?
[3:45:26] <malcobraaklynny> it's real lul
[3:45:27] <andyfutrell> I been enjoying watching people like wooile beat games way more now that my disability is making where I can't play the games I want to anymore chat
[3:45:29] <ggbhtg> BABY : 0 ATK INIFINTY DEF
[3:45:33] <Supabait> THE ULTIMATE STRATEGY
[3:45:35] <+Hacerous> doodStare
[3:45:40] <Supabait> THE BLOODLINE TECHNIQUE
[3:45:43] <Applecannon63> wait is he wearing a baby hold vest?
[3:45:45] <malcobraaklynny> you could decapitate him
[3:45:47] <Darren716> Why didnt he put babies on his head and neck?
[3:45:48] <NotHereToStream> lasoon the neck
[3:45:51] <andre11dr> That's still not as dumb as angel uzy
[3:45:56] <+chosenjuan42> Mario doesn't care he is down to kill babies
[3:45:57] <+jiggy_snipe> ah
[3:45:58] <ggbhtg> BABY has 0 ATK/INFINITY DEF
[3:45:58] <CollinCoyKoi> Frank then duct tapes another gun into Matt Murdock's hands and doesn't tell him about the enemy's baby armor
[3:45:59] <heartlesshealer> hanging ONLY
[3:46:04] <heartlesshealer> NOOSE is the true hero!
[3:46:07] <+jiggy_snipe> hanging was the only way
[3:46:16] <+Hacerous> this is the most .. out of context thing i've ever heard
[3:46:17] <+chosenjuan42> NOOSE
[3:46:20] <+BionicPulga> Lol
[3:46:22] <Applecannon63> ooof
[3:46:28] <@akuda_bar> s-strategic noose
[3:46:28] <+jiggy_snipe> strategic noose Kappa

[3:46:36] <dj_arashi_rora> true hero noose!
[3:46:38] <%emperordread> Don't negotiate with terrorists, kill the babies to show you are not afraid
[3:46:42] <andre11dr> How did that even work
