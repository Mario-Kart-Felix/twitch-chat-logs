[0:00:00] <+AjaxFoamingCleanser> oh yeah
[0:00:00] <+Exicuren> Kotor 2 always has some kind of issues
[0:00:00] <Klefth> It's not the game. I think it has to do with his usb setup? Like using a USB capture card or something?
[0:00:01] <%Reverend_Roscoe> better

[0:00:13] <%bread_assassin> G O O D
[0:00:13] <+Invlux> :)
[0:00:14] <ashenjuan25> Aye we back
[0:00:14] <lonegargoyle> hell yeah
[0:00:14] <%BisoromiBear> Good to go bois
[0:00:18] <+Bluemanzee> :)
[0:00:18] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> good 😄
[0:00:20] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> we gucci mane
[0:00:22] <+plowman35> sehr gut
[0:00:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Cando's +0 in DEX from his armor makes him awful with guns because to hit with guns runs off DEX. He has gun feats carried over from the previous game but he is not a shooty boy anymore.
[0:00:43] <%a_goth_pancake> bacc
[0:00:49] <memejima> We back?
[0:01:02] <%DatAsuna> Big disagree
[0:01:05] <theotrainwreck> HE WILL SHOOT
[0:01:07] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:01:09] <+oda_flobunaga> okay you do you
[0:01:10] <%subjectg> Let me clear this up: Cando still gets attack bonuses from dex, but he gets no extra defense, it’s not horrifically bad but it is pretty suboptimal
[0:01:11] <+plowman35> SHOOTY IS THE WAY
[0:01:13] <%DatAsuna> Spec his heavy repeater and he'll be oneshotting dudes
[0:01:15] <+UberWolfman> NO HE SHOOT THO
[0:01:19] <%Visorak6> The 0 dex thing is the only thing that prevents him from being massively overpowered
[0:01:22] <lotharrio> It will apply to his attack. Not his defense or saves, I think.
[0:01:22] <+prime_name> MANDO ONLY SHOOT
[0:01:24] <LeafSprout> apparently its the games problem because the game doesn't use multicore processors correctly?
[0:01:27] <+Bluemanzee> I think they'll be fine tbh
[0:01:28] <sendart> hes better as melee buy he can be a shooty boy just fine
[0:01:29] <+oda_flobunaga> you do you
[0:01:30] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Alright Im back
[0:01:32] <%ChoculaUltra> pew pew

[0:01:38] <+tearfuldevil> woolie sounds salty lol
[0:01:39] <+UberWolfman> NO BAD WOOLIE

[0:01:50] <thequickbrownrabbit> what he get space arthritus and now he cant shoot?
[0:01:50] <%BisoromiBear> notekRobo notekPunk
[0:01:51] <JaceDarkstar> you tell'em woolz
[0:01:54] <Prince_Robot> i mean the game isnt terribly difficult in the first plce so why not?
[0:01:55] <+oda_flobunaga> just wanted to bring it to you attention
[0:01:55] <%ChoculaUltra> its always been style over numbers, cmon people!
[0:01:58] <%subjectg> of course, kotor 2’s very ez so whatever
[0:01:58] <%emperordread> If we cared about numbers, we'd be Pat LUL
[0:02:03] <+therabbles> cool is more important
[0:02:12] <%LiterallyTotori> numbers don't count anyway
[0:02:12] <+tearfuldevil> @abelincoln_catpuncher i mena, Twictch Plays has fucking nothing to do with optimization
[0:02:13] <+griffball13> haha mando go pewpew
[0:02:15] <%Joe2187> TRUST YOUR FISTS, THE JEDI WILL NEVER HELP YOU
[0:02:15] <theotrainwreck> guns for the style meter in your heart
[0:02:19] <YakumoYomi> "Cando go PEW PEW"
[0:02:24] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Unless you're playing FF2. Always be unarmed
[0:02:24] <%Jetzord> What's the point of slaughtering hordes if you don't hit that SSS
[0:02:24] <ChinMusicTwo> Monks in other CRPGs are usually pretty good irc
[0:02:27] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> so anyways, i start BLASTIN
[0:02:29] <%subjectg> But cando with two swords is cool too! He literally becomes solidus when you do that!
[0:02:29] <LeafSprout> AYYYYY
[0:02:40] <LeafSprout> IT FIXED
[0:02:41] <theotrainwreck> ok, what the FUCK defines a cRPG?
[0:02:51] <atema128> We back bois
[0:03:00] <+Bluemanzee> No multipass :(
[0:03:01] <%xcompleasedad> Sound is FIXED
[0:03:01] <%Visorak6> I'm glad woolie remembered his passport
[0:03:09] <%Gruhunchously> Papers Please
[0:03:09] <%ECRead> papers please
[0:03:11] <Scrub_Seeker> "do you have your passport"
[0:03:15] <lotharrio> @theotrainwreck Like most RPGs it's poorly defined. At best, it's a level of freedom and choice in both character progression and story.
[0:03:20] <green_skeleton> It's good Woolie has his passport
[0:03:22] <theotrainwreck> ok
[0:03:27] <arkv01> no, but I have this N pass
[0:03:37] <%LiterallyTotori> odd that woolie is worried about passes at a time like this
[0:03:41] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @theotrainwreck i would personally say they're games based off of 90s computer RPGs that are dialogue and choice heavy, with combat mostly following some variation of DnD rules
[0:03:50] <Zebroneath> Woolie knows a thing or two about getting certifiable passes....
[0:03:50] <LeafSprout> @theotrainwreck cRPG are rpgs based off of a form of D&D and are typically isometric
[0:03:57] <+griffball13> FAKE NEWS
[0:04:09] <Halospaz117> THE EBON HAWK WAS SO BIG GUYS

[0:04:12] <+tearfuldevil> "the ebon hawk is a capital class vessel" lol what
[0:04:12] <LeafSprout> but its a pretty loose genre

[0:06:02] <lotharrio> @tearknack I guess yeah. I was trying to remember a different term that cars share. But I don't know if it's the right term.
[0:06:06] <Halospaz117> "He was the one on fire"
[0:06:18] <%DatAsuna> I heard general vaklu can tell it's not butter

[0:07:45] <%subjectg> oh man did we already talk to HK about this?
[0:07:45] <lotharrio> Before Carth went crazy on that beach planet and shot himself.
[0:07:48] <LeafSprout> oh shit
[0:07:49] <keiji_maede> LMFAO!!!
[0:07:51] <%Jetzord> Carth got what he deserved
[0:07:52] <StarkAvKnark> Carth NOTHING
[0:07:54] <thequickbrownrabbit> new backscracher
[0:07:54] <%LiterallyTotori> Carth dropped it one day
[0:07:56] <%TheFabledAble> TAKE IT AND PUT IT ON MIRA AND THEN NEVER USE IIIIIIIT
[0:07:57] <+griffball13> now shoot the rest of his family with it
[0:08:01] <theotrainwreck> This gun, is the best gun
[0:08:02] <$Jazzarms> Carth (Nothing)
[0:08:02] <%BisoromiBear> RIP pour one out
[0:08:04] <phatmac16> DESTROY IT
[0:08:06] <%DatAsuna> you'd still have the gun
[0:08:10] <alexandrecau> he pawned it
[0:08:12] <memejima> Ok so Carth is DEAD Dead
[0:08:12] <Dementedpenguin> The best Carth cameo: a menu screen. Kappa /
[0:08:12] <%DatAsuna> if he lived he just lost it
[0:08:15] <+Zyquux> This guy went to the mystery planet, looted a corpse and came back to Onderan to sell it.
[0:08:15] <AceAran> Gun used to kill carth's son.
[0:08:20] <%Visorak6> corpse nothing
[0:08:24] <memejima> In case you needed MORE confirmation, he is dead
[0:08:27] <LeafSprout> why do people hate my boy carth????
[0:08:29] <%alpharius88> corpose nothing
[0:08:29] <lotharrio> Carth did some dirty stuff to get off that planet.
[0:08:30] <jorniev> pockets sold it
[0:08:35] <lotharrio> BREAK IT DOWN
[0:08:42] <+oda_flobunaga> Onasi Gun= Exar Kun's Battle Suit
[0:08:49] <CaptHat211> I never understood why they originally called Ponda Baba "Walrus Man". He and his race looked more like spiders. "Spiderface" would've been more appropriate.
[0:09:00] <ashenjuan25> I threw it into the ocean after turning full feral and forsook his decency
[0:09:01] <arkv01> report to the CBT room, carth
[0:09:06] <thequickbrownrabbit> carth was a master of the harambe dicks out fighting style
[0:09:08] <%Jetzord> Revan didn't have enough change for a sandwich one day and had to give them Carth's gun in exchange
[0:09:16] <memejima> Break it into components, then throw those components in the garbage
[0:10:00] <lotharrio> Would be good on a humanoid gun user.
[0:10:05] <DSD24> That Sith Mask was not cool
[0:10:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> They say jedi can feel the previous owner. This one feels like bitch.
[0:10:29] <%Gruhunchously> I imagine that Carth is unceremoniously decomposing in a ditch somewhere
[0:10:33] <+oda_flobunaga> How's it feeeel Sith, to be a ....... Bith
[0:10:36] <%subjectg> hey look, pocket’s sensory visor is there too
[0:10:57] <theotrainwreck> Does eu star wars ever get into force-stand type shit? And if so can I be pointed in that direction?
[0:11:08] <memejima> "This gun feels like Filicide"

[0:48:07] <DSD24> @green_skeleton Did she have blonde hair?
[0:48:12] <%theman515> theman515 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! heeeyyy good to see Master V back!
[0:48:13] <%DatAsuna> See what I mean? The game just assumes you know
[0:48:14] <%LiterallyTotori> woo woo political train
[0:48:15] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Onderoff
[0:48:17] <ashenjuan25> ONDEROUT!
[0:48:18] <%DatAsuna> It's not ancient tho
[0:48:18] <+Velociraptor_Cleftes> Just have a referendum about Onderexit
[0:48:24] <green_skeleton> @DSD24 the asian looking one
[0:48:24] <alrobot2014> wasn't exar kun 40 years ago?
[0:48:25] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus its not ancient history, it slike 40 years ack
[0:48:26] <+oda_flobunaga> 50 years is not ancient history
[0:48:27] <lotharrio> Stuff from like 200 year ago.
[0:48:27] <%DatAsuna> You literally said last stream exar kun was this lifetime
[0:48:29] <gruulmagebeast> onderouch
[0:48:29] <%Gruhunchously> 40 years insn't exactly ancient history
[0:48:36] <%Chatterbox1991> Louis Frontnac
[0:48:38] <%Jetzord> Soon they'll be Ondergone
[0:48:41] <%DatAsuna> Canderous was around when exar kun was around
[0:48:43] <DSD24> @green_skeleton Ah I know the face
[0:48:44] <asurite_warrior> that was 30 to 50 years ago man
[0:48:48] <gruulmagebeast> the onderon will rise again
[0:48:50] <lotharrio> Oh wait, right. Exar Kun was within two generations.
[0:48:55] <muniea3> what's the leader's opinion on black face?
[0:48:55] <gruulmagebeast> secede from the republic
[0:48:55] <+CelebrityGhost> drinks and politics always go well together
[0:48:57] <+oda_flobunaga> Technically, Exar Kun is still around
[0:48:57] <ThePimpGuin> 50 years isn't ancient on a galactic scale, it aint on a normal scale
[0:49:01] <%DatAsuna> within one generation
[0:49:03] <%TheFabledAble> HEY REMEMBER WHEN WE MURDERED THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND?! ANYWAYS, NATIONAL SOVERAINTY AMERICA FIRST
[0:49:07] <+PhantomMiG> that was only 40 year that was Reagan
[0:49:08] <+oda_flobunaga> as a force ghost
[0:49:10] <%DatAsuna> Also bear in mind humans live past 100 ins tar wars constantly
[0:49:13] <+Invlux> I just looked up and thought that guy was wearing a party hat
[0:49:15] <+tearfuldevil> yeah V appears to have forgotten that he learned about Exar Kun being that recent
[0:49:19] <dead_harmony13> "This flag isn't racist it's just old"
[0:49:20] <DSD24> I love when in games you can say "I don't care"
[0:49:22] <%Gruhunchously> This is an acceptable stance to take
[0:49:27] <+Kduff89> lets get drunk and talk about politics. that will never turn out bad ever

[0:52:08] <%Gruhunchously> WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM ABOUT IT
[0:52:09] <%subjectg> look at this halo 2 looking mofo
[0:52:18] <%kekkerscrew> I Agree DatAsuna

[0:52:24] <green_skeleton> Yeah I like giving Cando a huge rifle
[0:52:27] <+Velociraptor_Cleftes> Also agreed DatAsuna
[0:52:38] <+Velociraptor_Cleftes> Big boi needs a BFG
[0:52:52] <%Gruhunchously> They literally say 'Annoying Recitation'
[0:52:53] <green_skeleton> HK always gets double pistols cause I love his animation with em
[0:52:57] <lotharrio> I honestly don't remember her.
[0:53:13] <thequickbrownrabbit> this game just needs a dialogue option thats the guy giving the peace sign and fading away
[0:53:14] <+tearfuldevil> @lotharrio she gives you the mission to sabotage things for vaklu
[0:53:26] <lotharrio> Ah, makes sense then.

[0:53:55] <lotharrio> Cause that's where the Jedi is. But you shouldn't know that yet
[0:53:58] <blackskulldragon18> Why not
[0:53:59] <+oda_flobunaga> you saw the Jedi with the queen
[0:54:00] <%DatAsuna> Sure you could make a discount darth maul
[0:54:01] <%emperordread> VIDEO GAMES
[0:54:02] <mrblack499> why not
[0:54:04] <+MagicBeanBurrito> the jedi counselor
[0:54:04] <%DatAsuna> but you could also be original
[0:54:07] <+oda_flobunaga> in a cutscene
[0:54:13] <%subjectg> Metagaming! DM!
[0:54:17] <%LiterallyTotori> "I'm here for literally ONE REASON, please STOP deterring me!"

[2:00:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woolie
[2:00:34] <lotharrio> You killed people and they liked it, so they're gonna work with you, got it?
[2:00:42] <alexandrecau> Light later
[2:00:44] <%kyh9> Their alignment changes based on YOU, not based on the action
[2:00:44] <lotharrio> They are full LIGHT LATER
[2:00:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> You're an influencer Woolie
[2:00:49] <olaksi> You did bad things for a good reason, friendship
[2:00:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woolie at risk
[2:00:51] <%heartlesshealer> passive mind jacking
[2:00:52] <eliudfs1> It's light side later actions
[2:00:52] <%CursedNobleman> think of Charname as a magnet.
[2:00:52] <+Invlux> ! BRAIN AT RISK !
[2:00:55] <+oda_flobunaga> It is like magnets
[2:00:57] <illTemperedSeaBass> Does the influence you gain depend on charisma? For that matter, does charisma influence light/dark gain? Last run I hyper-focused charisma, reached both full light and full Bao influence before even leaving Telos. Was hilarious.
[2:01:01] <eliudfs1> Light side later for redepmtion
[2:01:05] <+MaikuKnight> !uptime

[2:01:30] <+tearfuldevil> how did you not know this
[2:01:32] <%DatAsuna> "gray"
[2:01:42] <%Irridium> Nah this is great light side HK is hilarious
[2:01:43] <lotharrio> "Oh I can be a hero who explodes random idiots? Yeah okay, I'll be good."
[2:01:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> light side later playthrough
[2:01:45] <olaksi> Light/darkside is just political tribalism LUL
[2:01:48] <+SolidusRex> HK = Hot
[2:01:51] <memejima> It's like it takes light from you and they just siphon it
[2:01:56] <+Freeborg1997> Please, HK light side is great!

[2:02:01] <halfmasks> FANN Y PAK CONFIRMED MORALLY GRAY
[2:02:02] <+oda_flobunaga> Magnets
[2:02:03] <arkv01> thats FUCKED
[2:02:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> Are you manipulating them?
[2:02:04] <%subjectg> I got HK up to light side mastery, it looks amazing
[2:02:07] <DSD24> Are you sure about that Woolie?
[2:02:07] <Halospaz117> Well, it does make sense, but we'll get there eventually
[2:02:08] <ingman112> It doesn’t actually change anything, it’s just the background
[2:02:09] <%kyh9> "You blowing up that mandalorian really made me think about how to feed starving children"
[2:02:22] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Letting them do Evil things gets it out of there system and makes them good
[2:02:24] <%heartlesshealer> V
[2:02:25] <%Jetzord> @JetpackMcQuack it'll be explain more in the late game
[2:02:29] <arkv01> this is eroge dating sim rules
[2:02:34] <+tearfuldevil> light side hk is cool, maybe see what he's like before you get all terified woolie
[2:02:35] <%DatAsuna> is this how YOU justify your actions?
[2:02:38] <a_mad_dragon> two wrongs make a right SoonerLater
[2:02:40] <+Allyofwar> HK's turning good for the same reason Ghandi becomes an asshole.
[2:02:40] <%JetpackMcQuack> Net Light gain cyr5Head
[2:02:43] <KessOrangeSoda> Yeah but Force Bonds is brain washing
[2:02:43] <%kyh9> This is next level of ludo-narrative dissonance
[2:02:44] <memejima> "Your puppy kicking really made me think about how much fun opening an orphanage would be"
[2:02:46] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Maybe Naruto retroactively forgave HK's actions and turned him good
[2:02:46] <olaksi> THAT'S HOW THEY GET TO YOU, the damn goody shoes
[2:02:49] <%CursedNobleman> @arkv01 you dont ahve to give em the dicc to redeem them tho LUL
[2:02:50] <lotharrio> They like that bad thing you did, so now they are going to go along with what you normally like, such as saving orphans or treating puppies with hurt paws.
[2:02:51] <+ItsRatman> I saw Woolie murder a guy, I want to donate to the homeless now.
[2:02:52] <+EmptyMug> You're literally spreading the "light now/later" philosophy
[2:02:57] <solasknight> It's not the action of doing bad things, it's the action of gaining their trust. The more of their trust you have, the more your alignment 'influences' them
[2:03:12] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You really want that HK dialogue though.
[2:03:28] <%Gruhunchously> No
[2:03:33] <lotharrio> Only for Jedi-possible characters, I think.
[2:03:38] <+tearfuldevil> yes
[2:03:41] <olaksi> It's 200 IQ lightsiding
[2:03:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> You're a Jedi Master remember, you're just mind fucking them UwU
[2:03:56] <+tearfuldevil> there is light hk dialogue, iirc?
[2:03:59] <muniea3> blegh
[2:04:04] <arkv01> 14 months is still insane
[2:04:10] <%DatAsuna> I wouldn't call it light dialogue
[2:04:13] <Halospaz117> It's really just a way to check your influence
[2:04:14] <MasterDecoder> I WANT TO MURDER....FOR GOOD!
[2:04:15] <lotharrio> Murder for good, Woolie. Also just the background colors.
[2:04:16] <the_0digit> shut up tho
[2:04:17] <+oda_flobunaga> Lightside HK is hilarious
[2:04:20] <eliudfs1> It also changes for light/dark side force cost
[2:04:23] <%DatAsuna> I'd call it a one-off joke convo
[2:04:24] <eliudfs1> for power
[2:04:25] <%Gruhunchously> It allows them to use alignment based equipment and Force Powers
[2:04:27] <lotharrio> If they aren't Jedi it changes nothing.
[2:04:28] <+SolidusRex> Party member alignments for non-force users is USELESS
[2:04:38] <%heartlesshealer> oh
[2:04:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Not HK and Goto
[2:04:52] <%Irridium> Maybe that was what they originally planned but... 14 months
[2:04:53] <+tearfuldevil> yeah its not as in depth as you think lol
[2:04:56] <thequickbrownrabbit> HK goes to the light side and all the rust falls off
[2:05:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Attan and others yes
[2:05:03] <%Gruhunchously> It works for certain party members, but not droids
[2:05:04] <%a_goth_pancake> "my bg is blue. I am a paragon of goodness and purity."
[2:05:10] <%JetpackMcQuack> Maybe in the next one kinamaFeelsbad
[2:05:15] <%subjectg> You are putting too much stock in a game made in an archaic engine
[2:05:19] <%a_goth_pancake> "also, I like eating babies and robbing banks."
[2:05:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> The droids don't change but the humans do change
[2:05:46] <+eanscrale> Well there's that pacifist chip...
[2:05:47] <%jiggy_snipe> he doesn''t
[2:05:49] <olaksi> @a_goth_pancake Sounds like American politics LUL
[2:05:49] <%jiggy_snipe> only murder
[2:05:50] <%DatAsuna> The answer is HK-55
[2:05:52] <+tearfuldevil> @doc_ock_rokc humans and near humans
[2:05:54] <lotharrio> Shush
[2:05:55] <+oda_flobunaga> it is

[2:06:06] <solasknight> I mean if you think about it, Palpatine had to do a couple good things to gain Anakin's influence
[2:06:07] <%a_goth_pancake> @olaksi
[2:06:08] <+tearfuldevil> or a zabrka, or whatever the fuck
[2:06:10] <%jiggy_snipe> he'll murder for good?
[2:06:15] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieSMUG
[2:06:18] <lotharrio> Has changes for Jedi.
[2:06:18] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Especially for good
[2:06:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> @tear organics
[2:06:28] <+MidnightBurst12> iridonian zabrak
[2:06:31] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah that's true
[2:06:35] <+tearfuldevil> @doc_ock_rokc perfect
[2:06:48] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie makes good people out of Racism, maybe that is the true power of the N-Pass
[2:07:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Droids don't change much. Meatbags change far more
[2:07:09] <+MidnightBurst12> 14 months
[2:07:09] <MasterDecoder> 2006
[2:07:13] <+EmptyMug> HK's evil, but hot so he's grey
[2:07:28] <%DatAsuna> no
[2:07:29] <+tearfuldevil> @doc_ock_rokc and the good changes aren't as noticeable as the evil ones
[2:07:37] <Breakfast_Megapowers> actually this game can't be ahead of its time since this story was long ago in a galaxy far far away
[2:07:39] <Rawklobstah88> YO. ITS V MILLS.
[2:07:40] <+oda_flobunaga> But it is newer than Planescape though and that covers everything

[2:21:22] <+GenesisKnight> I mean... you're not wrong
[2:21:23] <%a_goth_pancake> unfortunately
[2:21:23] <%kyh9> Well Krogans actually nearly reached space-travel on their own but they got so bored of peace that they decided nuking Tuchanka was more interesting
[2:21:24] <%ECRead> makes my dick huge, yes
[2:21:24] <%HostilePoundcakes> yeah pretty much
[2:21:28] <Halospaz117> Ok I see how someone can not like that trope now

[2:21:33] <jorniev> american futball
[2:21:33] <T_Sasquatch> Eh .....
[2:21:34] <Djinnazz> Then N.Korea
[2:21:34] <+MASTODONSENTRY> Russia is too

[2:21:43] <youngthekday6> I been watching dokapon and I just wanna say... as a french canadian... woolie speaking french is one of my fave sounds
[2:21:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> woolie kickstarts ww3

[2:22:02] <+tearfuldevil> the difference is that krogans and mandos are good at war and care about honour
[2:22:05] <+Estuko> Warriors so proud that seeking Hospitals puts you in financial downfall
[2:22:06] <+MidnightBurst12> france pre-ww1
[2:22:06] <jorniev> communists
[2:22:10] <serpenttucker> I come from a military family and they DO NOT like it when I find somethiung disagreeable about it.
[2:22:17] <%DatAsuna> rude!
[2:22:17] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus We spend more money on our military than any other country on earth and the only way to obtain good healthcare that wont cost you a figurative arm and leg is military service. Until you do lose an arm or leg and then they boot you out with little to know support
[2:22:24] <+Invlux> V GETS BACK ON THE BOAT
[2:22:38] <%DatAsuna> They're just sith
[2:22:39] <%DatAsuna> *shrug*
[2:22:44] <thequickbrownrabbit> if V gets sick again woolies gonna have to drag him back here in a plastic bubble
[2:22:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> Thought crime
[2:22:58] <%a_goth_pancake> @estuko this is the way.
[2:23:00] <%subjectg> Old men, running the world
[2:23:05] <liriallirial> fun stream woolz, first one i am watching
[2:23:10] <%emperordread> So the Assassin's Creed is 'we have no creed'?
[2:23:17] <%DatAsuna> 90% of sith resurgences are just dark jedi
[2:23:21] <%Jetzord> If you work real hard, and get real disillusioned, anyone can be a sith
[2:23:40] <dead_harmony13> Kinda fucked that we're expected to say the pledge of allegiance every morning at school
[2:23:45] <%DatAsuna> Well in ac3 it was less about your cut and more "democracy doesn't work" shit
[2:24:06] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[2:24:08] <thequickbrownrabbit> Skyrim 2
[2:24:15] <GoldeNOVA> Wake me up when they announce Space Marine: Space Wolf
[2:24:19] <%DatAsuna> mercy and pillaging
[2:24:21] <%DatAsuna> no slavery
[2:24:24] <arkv01> I have yet to watch the trailer, looking forward to seeing this bit LUL
[2:24:28] <T_Sasquatch> WATCH VINLAND SAGA
[2:24:34] <%DatAsuna> it is
[2:24:39] <%a_goth_pancake> yup
[2:24:39] <%kyh9> TALK ABOUT SWTOR SPOILERS
[2:24:39] <T_Sasquatch> Shit gets fucked
[2:24:49] <%DatAsuna> no spoilers
[2:24:52] <%Jetzord> I can't get back into MMOs man, it
[2:24:53] <%DatAsuna> he'll get them later
[2:24:56] <%a_goth_pancake> jus made a new character and I'm already level thirty.
[2:25:03] <+Zouledge> even without the double xp it is very easy to lvl up
[2:25:03] <phatmac16> Shad did a good video that makes fun of how wrong Vikings are represented in that trailer
[2:25:09] <BAM4LFE> imperial agent forever
[2:25:11] <%a_goth_pancake> no muka shaka paca tho...
[2:25:12] <thequickbrownrabbit> woolie vs swortor when because i aient playing it mmos bad
[2:25:13] <%DatAsuna> agreed
[2:25:15] <%Irridium> Agent storyline is real solid
[2:25:19] <RedSqurrl> Base storylines are good. Some xpack story arcs are...iffy
[2:25:19] <thomassolorio> hoes mad
[2:25:20] <+Zouledge> Sith warriors and imp agent are best stories
[2:25:20] <Halospaz117> As long as it doesn't try to connect to KOTOR it's good
[2:25:21] <%DatAsuna> Swtor is the one in the middle of quality
[2:25:23] <+Ixek> Story is good enough, combat is very simplified WoW.
[2:25:24] <%Irridium> the MMO part
[2:25:25] <Djinnazz> the story
[2:25:26] <jorniev> naw man
[2:25:27] <+MidnightBurst12> the mmo
[2:25:31] <Halospaz117> When it does try to connect to KOTOR...... hoo boy
[2:25:32] <+Zouledge> the stories past lvl 50 get worse imo
[2:25:33] <%a_goth_pancake> can't be a wookiee though, so that sucks.
[2:25:34] <%kyh9> I dunno, Knights of the Eternal Empire was on the level of KOTOR2 for me
[2:25:37] <jorniev> dialogue wheel
[2:25:37] <ashenjuan25> AC Vikings to women and children: go on get out of here
[2:25:39] <%DatAsuna> I don't love the visuals either
[2:25:41] <%kyh9> Very Clone Wars
[2:25:42] <+Jasuchin> Lana Beniko is the best sith
[2:25:48] <BAM4LFE> you pilot a giant mech in a robot planet
[2:25:49] <jorniev> MASS EFFECT DILOGUE WHEEL
[2:25:53] <+NopeBadguy> EA heavily bogged it down with super cynical paywalls in the beginning. Not nearly as bad now. @WoolieVersus
[2:25:59] <%subjectg> I don’t like what they did to a certain character
[2:25:59] <BAM4LFE> you do the gainax pose
[2:25:59] <%kyh9> With stupid sexy Rule 63 Anakin
[2:25:59] <%DatAsuna> I think the knight and warrior are big overrated
[2:26:04] <thequickbrownrabbit> i bounce off the tab targeting combat and slow grinding
[2:26:06] <Halospaz117> The Jedi Knight is also voiced by David Hayter
[2:26:12] <Djinnazz> It ruined Raven.
[2:26:18] <%DatAsuna> I agree on agent and inq being bae tho
[2:26:19] <gastherobots> Really good single player RPG if you play it like that.
[2:26:21] <Djinnazz> REVEN*
[2:26:22] <gastherobots> But a terrible MMO
[2:26:24] <%kyh9> @DatAsuna They're good but about what you'd expect. Agent and Inquisitor are underrated though
[2:26:36] <Halospaz117> Also the Bounty Hunter has a Mandolorian companion voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch who is romancable
[2:26:38] <%DatAsuna> Nothing is kotor 2
[2:26:45] <%DatAsuna> not even JFO, which avellone also wrote
[2:26:47] <%kyh9> It's not a canon issue, it's mainly that the areas and shit are too big, since they're all MMO sized
[2:26:49] <ashenjuan25> Nothing will ever be on kotor 2 level story
[2:26:50] <gastherobots> Also the expansions are pretty bad.
[2:26:59] <+NopeBadguy> It's also just not a good MMO with not a lot of good content, like they kinda realized the only reason people wanna play is the story.
[2:27:05] <+Jasuchin> You can be a lesbian jedi who marries a sith woman. It's pretty awesome
[2:27:12] <%Livelinne> !uptime
[2:27:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 27 minutes
[2:27:15] <%DatAsuna> It's got a lot of content now
[2:27:19] <%DatAsuna> it launched pretty barren
[2:27:19] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:27:31] <%kyh9> It's not Rise of the Skywalker
[2:27:35] <gastherobots> Is doesn't have any amazing ideas, but the interwar setting where Jedi and Sith exist as """peace""" is really interesting and fun.
[2:27:42] <gastherobots> ***at
[2:27:42] <%a_goth_pancake> @woolieversus you can dress like carth
[2:27:46] <Halospaz117> I try to look at SWTOR as it's own thing and ignore whenever it tries to tie into KOTOR
[2:27:50] <%Irridium> it's honestly fine for the most part
[2:27:50] <+NopeBadguy> Don't you still have to sub to access expansion content?
[2:27:51] <+Zouledge> ^
[2:27:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> It was peak "EA is evil"
[2:27:56] <%generalve> F U THOSE ARE FUN
[2:27:57] <olaksi> I know nothing about SWTOR but I kinda hate it now?
[2:28:03] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:28:04] <+Vijuani> it has problems but i enjoyed
[2:28:04] <Axle13j> THOSE ARE GREAT lmaooo
[2:28:05] <%generalve> SPIN SPIN SPIN
[2:28:06] <Hopit> EA and its an mmo
[2:28:08] <T_Sasquatch> Rebels FUCKING sucks tho
[2:28:09] <ashenjuan25> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:28:10] <+MidnightBurst12> ehh
[2:28:10] <eliudfs1> Its also the last remnant of the lost leyends
[2:28:13] <GoldeNOVA> The thin sabers look cool
[2:28:16] <Halospaz117> SPEEN
[2:28:17] <%DatAsuna> @olaksi just watch the inquisitor story
[2:28:21] <jorniev> YEAAAH SPIN
[2:28:22] <+GenesisKnight> Thin sabers look lame
[2:28:22] <+Jasuchin> It's kinda the least EA of EA's Star Wars games
[2:28:22] <thequickbrownrabbit> fucking warframe coptering
[2:28:22] <%jiggy_snipe> its stupid enough to be fun
[2:28:23] <DSD24> I like Yoshimitsu
[2:28:23] <eliudfs1> that survive the disney purge
[2:28:25] <BAM4LFE> the fact that the game lets you go fuck the force is the best
[2:28:29] <%DatAsuna> by never using it that way
[2:28:31] <%generalve> WOOLIE VS fallen order
[2:28:32] <+Vijuani> PLAY FALLEN ORDER WOOLIE
[2:28:47] <%JetpackMcQuack> And grievous was cool
[2:28:51] <Halospaz117> Fallen Order is rad man
[2:28:55] <jorniev> the light saber spins like a dante move
[2:29:03] <%subjectg> Yoshimitsu works because he’s an outlier and not a serious threat
[2:29:08] <Djinnazz> Grievous WAS cool.
[2:29:09] <+Zouledge> not a big fan of souls but yeah JFO is pretty cool
[2:29:20] <T_Sasquatch> Yeyeyeye
[2:29:21] <+GenesisKnight> Genndy Grievous is best Grievous
[2:29:22] <%ChoculaUltra> you know, when Respawn kept talking about they were making a Star Wars game I for one was looking for something more than "western dark souls but with a star wars skin"
[2:29:26] <ashenjuan25> Fallen order has some issues with the poise mechanic
[2:29:27] <MasterDecoder> Gendy Greivous is dope as fuck
[2:29:29] <+Jasuchin> You crush his ribs
[2:29:30] <%ECRead> I love Genndy Greivous
[2:29:31] <%chiluzza> genndy grievous kills shaggy
[2:29:31] <%a_goth_pancake> did you see the grievous' house episode? that's almost gendy grievous.
[2:29:34] <serpenttucker> Genndy is great.
[2:29:40] <+Jasuchin> You crush his fucking ribs with the force
[2:29:40] <+valiard> Im down for Woolie Vs Fallen Order
[2:29:41] <+Estuko> God-Like
[2:29:50] <mr_sups> Genndy Grevious is the coolest thing ever
[2:29:52] <+Freeborg1997> They're trying to keep him consistent with Ep. 3
[2:29:52] <+Zouledge> Clone wars greivous is one of the few weak points of the cgi series imo
[2:29:54] <ashenjuan25> Fallen order is the only kinda acceptable
[2:30:00] <%a_goth_pancake> did you see the grievous'house episode? that was almost gendy grievous.
[2:30:02] <thequickbrownrabbit> i love starwrs abilty to ruin something fix it then ruin it again
[2:30:05] <clonexsniper> Gendy Drievous requires a gunship to stand a chance
[2:30:06] <ashenjuan25> The spinning in combos was alright
[2:30:09] <Djinnazz> Genndy Grievous is HK's Ultimate form.
[2:30:13] <%a_goth_pancake> twice wtf
[2:30:13] <%Irridium> @legacy0117 Assassin's Creed has been done with desmond for a while so that doesn't work. I've been self-justifying it as you're playing as the one decent viking who didn't do that stuff
[2:30:17] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Genndy Grievous"? Is that the 2d show where he 1v4s a bunch of Jedi masters?
[2:30:19] <T_Sasquatch> Comparing anything to Genndy never works
[2:30:19] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder that Gendy Grievous totally killed Jedi Shaggy.
[2:30:27] <DSD24> @illTemperedSeaBass Yes
[2:30:31] <%a_goth_pancake> sha'gi
[2:30:32] <ashenjuan25> I just hate how animations lies to me on Jedi master difficulty on the boss fights
[2:30:37] <+valiard> Clone Wars animated series by Tartakovsky is real good
[2:30:45] <jorniev> cooool
[2:30:49] <Wan6Saber> no
[2:30:53] <%ChoculaUltra> @a_goth_pancake real ones remember BibleThump
[2:30:53] <ashenjuan25> Sha’gi
[2:31:02] <Djinnazz> @legacy0117 Greivous never had the force i thought.
[2:31:06] <%ECRead> they didn't have horns, you know that
[2:31:07] <ashenjuan25> Grievous doesn’t get better tbh
[2:31:08] <olaksi> Remember when they found some Viking
[2:31:12] <lemon_lore> horn helms are fake
[2:31:13] <T_Sasquatch> The horns aren't a real thing
[2:31:14] <phatmac16> VIKINGS DON'T WEAR HORNED HELMETS
[2:31:17] <%ChoculaUltra> it also implies possibly a Jedi Scooby? Scoo'bi?
[2:31:17] <GoldeNOVA> The horns aren't real
[2:31:17] <%a_goth_pancake> @choculaultra BibleThump
[2:31:20] <phatmac16> FUR ARMOR ISN'T A THING
[2:31:22] <Wan6Saber> @Djinnazz oh course not, he's a cyborg
[2:31:23] <phatmac16> REEEEEEE
[2:31:24] <%generalve> THE VILLAIN IS GREAT
[2:31:24] <Halospaz117> Ehhhhh?
[2:31:25] <illTemperedSeaBass> Vikings wore never horns nor furs.
[2:31:27] <%DatAsuna> good game but
[2:31:30] <%DatAsuna> just good
[2:31:31] <illTemperedSeaBass> *neither
[2:31:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> Real good plot
[2:31:41] <%generalve> 2ND SISTER woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:31:42] <+Vijuani> enjoyed JFO but it definitely has problems
[2:31:43] <+prime_name> agreed
[2:31:45] <missyninjaeris1313> I clicked on twitch just because, holy shit
[2:31:47] <+NopeBadguy> I'm sure Avellone did the best he could in a not-RPG with Disney constraints
[2:31:48] <%DatAsuna> I like 40% of the JFO characters
[2:31:50] <%jiggy_snipe> V is so right
[2:31:55] <Halospaz117> I'd say 5 episodes stapled together is selling it short, I'd say it's more like a good season
[2:31:57] <+IamGrapes> a new hope is a DnD campaign in space
[2:31:58] <%kyh9> Rogue One?
[2:31:58] <+GenesisKnight> He's right you know
[2:31:59] <%jiggy_snipe> chracters can carry any dumb bs
[2:32:02] <%kyh9> So Rogue One?
[2:32:05] <ashenjuan25> Final fallen order challenge is Ornstien and Smough
[2:32:11] <+IamGrapes> nuts to rogue one
[2:32:14] <jorniev> guardians of the galaxy
[2:32:16] <Halospaz117> She's also hot
[2:32:20] <%DatAsuna> she's cool
[2:32:22] <GoldeNOVA> Goth gf
[2:32:24] <%ChoculaUltra> Now if only someone could tell that to Kathleen Kennedy...
[2:32:24] <%a_goth_pancake> 2nd sister is fucking awesome
[2:32:28] <%DatAsuna> she's in fact the only inquisitor that doesn't suck
[2:32:28] <jorniev> REMEMBER FURIOSA!?
[2:32:30] <+GenesisKnight> Peace!
[2:32:33] <Halospaz117> Fallen Order has some Waifus man
[2:32:33] <%subjectg> Personally i couldn’t take her seriously
[2:32:34] <+GenesisKnight> Long live V
