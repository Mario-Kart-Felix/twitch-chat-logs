[0:02:56] <$Jugg4n4ut> 30 60 90
[0:02:58] <@Menitta> ngl this was the first SF game I played
[0:03:07] <%justmildlilac> This game got done dirty by the devs
[0:03:08] <andre11dr> Max played it and was like "Wtf ,this feels bad"
[0:03:09] <+Superbro64> I can't remember if UMVC3 killed SFxT, if USF4 killed SFxT, or if SFV hype was coming up at the time
[0:03:19] <%Asuterisuku> King feels so weird in this game but in a good way.
[0:03:22] <+Superbro64> the timeline is blurry for me
[0:03:28] <ggbhtg> I was done after week one, I'm sitting this one out
[0:03:32] <@Menitta> SFV was announced almost two years after SFXT
[0:03:37] <ZeludeRose> this game is the mvci of last gen
[0:03:37] <ggbhtg> No more cross Tekken for me
[0:03:38] <%Solidnick18> i played abit of it that was about it
[0:03:43] <%ZeroCruz> I only remember liking how you could do your own colors on characters I guess
[0:03:43] <andre11dr> SFV was way after SFxT
[0:03:58] <DaKnightWarrior> I don't like the gems but the core game is fun.
[0:03:59] <+HolyGriddles> I got the game in 2015 and loved it. I ignored the gem system though
[0:04:00] <@Menitta> Admittedly there is some cool stuff in this game
[0:04:05] <ZeludeRose> shoutout to TeamSpooky for still running online tournaments
[0:04:06] <%Irridium> ah that old chestnut
[0:04:07] <$Jugg4n4ut> hit'em wit dat 30 60 90
[0:04:08] <nimu290> I feel like the Tekken characters were given the shaft
[0:04:13] <andre11dr> SFxT was like 2013 ,SFV got showed in 2015
[0:04:14] <%Solidnick18> i will say the intro for this game is amazing
[0:04:20] <%Asuterisuku> You actually CAN log in, it's just that no one's playing that way.
[0:04:21] <+Superbro64> GFWL actually makes SFxT fairly difficult to boot up on stream
[0:04:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> GAMES FOR WH OMEGALUL LIVE???
[0:04:30] <+Superbro64> playing it two years ago when I did was fun
[0:04:31] <%Asuterisuku> And it's a pain in the butt to do so.
[0:04:36] <$Jugg4n4ut> @solidnick18 that song is a banger for sure
[0:04:39] <%Kriss1827> @solidnick18 trailers were hype too
[0:04:43] <@Solidus_113> never forget
[0:04:44] <+HolyGriddles> Gotta mod in the PS3 dlc
[0:04:44] <%Solidnick18> yep

[0:05:00] <l0rd_sm3xy> thanks obama
[0:05:07] <+Superbro64> "lessons were learned" Kappa
[0:05:17] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:05:20] <%CptnCampy61> Lessons would not be learned
[0:05:21] <%ZeroCruz> I forgot how super hype the intro was! Can’t wait to see it again
[0:05:23] <@Menitta> See I have this on Steam and I never booted it so now I'm curious
[0:05:23] <Winner_92> yo thas a triangle
[0:05:28] <$Jugg4n4ut> 30 60 90
[0:05:28] <+Superbro64> Capcom proceeded to launch SFV with no arcade mode
[0:05:30] <rosemon5001> is thata a sauce lol?
[0:05:30] <ZeludeRose> 30 6ixty9inty
[0:05:31] <%Irridium> If Capcom wouldn't bother removing GFWL from Resident Evil 5 one of their biggest selling games why the FUCK would they care about SFxT
[0:05:42] <DrToiletPaper> sometimes forgive @solidus_113
[0:05:42] <DaKnightWarrior> The dark age of capcom.
[0:05:47] <%Asuterisuku> @Irridium It wasn't in Gold Edition when they finally put it on Steam.
[0:05:50] <@Menitta> a good ol fuckin RIGHT TRIANGLE
[0:05:58] <+jiggy_snipe> some people did 40 70 100 I think

[0:07:11] <+jiggy_snipe> the hype lead up was so cool then gems and then D:
[0:07:11] <andre11dr> Inefune and Ono were super responsible for the dark age
[0:07:13] <BalloniWright> SFxT had a 30 minutes CG movie with the trailers art style
[0:07:15] <brunoberserk> gems are !CURSED!

[0:23:35] <ZeludeRose> GOUGI activate
[0:23:42] <%baronblank> hurry, sacrifice your partner for more time on the clock
[0:23:46] <+HolyGriddles> Should have equipped the meter gems
[0:23:55] <+Superbro64> All jokes aside, people who do play this game say that the tekken characters are actually quite interestingly designed
[0:24:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DOWN DOWN 2 MEDIUMS, YOU WONT
[0:24:09] <%Solidnick18> nice job stve
[0:24:10] <ggbhtg> oh god
[0:24:10] <andre11dr> The mods actually make the game look way better
[0:24:11] <ZeludeRose> what is that accent...
[0:24:12] <BurdRightsActivist> GEMS OMEGALUL
[0:24:16] <SomersaultJustice> I honestly really enjoyed this game. I made a bunch of mods for it
[0:24:20] <$Superdandy96> Get that tag team finisher!
[0:24:22] <@Menitta> This looks really fun honestly
[0:24:25] <andre11dr> It had a terrible art style before
[0:24:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> MIKASA?!
[0:24:34] <@Menitta> I havent seen this game since the fucking Scrublords video
[0:24:35] <lazerscraper> @superbro64 recognizing the movelist for each tekken character puts a smile on my face
[0:24:39] <+TopTieramisu> too bad the bloated budget made capcom go all in with the gems gimmick
[0:24:40] <BaslerJones> this looks better than street fighter 4 tbh
[0:24:44] <@Solidus_113> oh man, twitch compression really hates this game
[0:24:49] <%Kriss1827> same menitta
[0:24:49] <ISkyHunterI> @Superbro64 the game could have been great if capcom fg department weren't complete idiots
[0:24:50] <Triplicat> another reminder that there is no attack on titan fighting game
[0:24:51] <+HolyGriddles> Tag team finishers are what got me into this game. Blew my mind first time I saw how cool they look
[0:24:52] <%Solidnick18> OOH
[0:24:57] <$Invlux> WHIF PogChamp
[0:24:59] <+GrandmasterBFunk> oh god charge up for a super
[0:25:01] <+TopTieramisu> it came out after vanilla sf4. it better look better than sf4
[0:25:03] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:25:04] <ZeludeRose> b tatsu
[0:25:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> I can't really tell the stream is compressed as hell
[0:25:08] <+Superbro64> @lazerscraper Username's "Lazer Scraper" Kappa I see what you doing there
[0:25:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> JETSTREAM SAM?!
[0:25:19] <%Solidnick18> show that x tekken tech
[0:25:21] <%Irridium> @Triplicat the DOA5 attack on titan level and costume pack is all we're gonna get feelsbadman
[0:25:24] <lazerscraper> ayeeeee
[0:25:31] <+BaronBattle> bro jet stream sam what a god
[0:25:35] <ggbhtg> All these one time only English voices for the Tekken cast LUL
[0:25:38] <%Solidnick18> B
[0:25:40] <ZeludeRose> eminem wins
[0:25:41] <Triplicat> Boolie
[0:25:44] <+BaronBattle> who is steve supposed to be?
[0:25:45] <%Asuterisuku> Anyone care to recommend a partner for King?
[0:25:53] <ZeludeRose> ed maybe baron
[0:25:56] <+TopTieramisu> is steve cosplaying as ed?
[0:26:07] <+TopTieramisu> yung ed, that is
[0:26:11] <Equirah> @Asuterisuku queen
[0:26:14] <BalloniWright> ed?
[0:26:15] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Oh, this is modded, I see
[0:26:16] <ZeludeRose> slim eddy
[0:26:20] <@Menitta> The reason no time was put into this game is because Capcom actually thought the world was gonna end in 2012 so they rushed it
[0:26:21] <@Menitta> Kappa
[0:26:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Have I missed much?
[0:26:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> he's dressed like Recovery-era Eminem bro LUL
[0:26:42] <ZeludeRose> nah just 1 match
[0:26:42] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu But was the budget really the reason?Let's not forget that this was the era where Capcom made you pay too see the finale of Asuras Asuras Wrath
[0:26:43] <%biggdaddymike> Death and Jetstream Sam
[0:26:45] <@Menitta> You missed the Fighterpedia episode
[0:26:51] <+BaronBattle> like dead ass? capris and all???
[0:26:54] <+TopTieramisu> @BalloniWright boxer's protege who became a buff older dude in sfv for some reason
[0:27:03] <%Solidnick18> spiral arrooow
[0:27:04] <+TopTieramisu> @andre11dr they spent way too much on the cinematics
[0:27:09] <FlamingNarwhal> @Reverend_Roscoe not much just one match. and the boys talking about the game's history and why it ended up they way it is
[0:27:10] <+BaronBattle> I remember Bryan being hella good in this game
[0:27:10] <ZeludeRose> @andre11dr i dont think there's a rational reason, i think capcom management is just dumb
[0:27:14] <%biggdaddymike> I walk away from the stream for a second and we're playing multi plat smash bros
[0:27:15] <lazerscraper> dudley and steve is so perfect
[0:27:15] <%Jack8274> It feels weird without an anime girl in the corner... What has happened to me
[0:27:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Cool, cool
[0:27:39] <ISkyHunterI> My uncle who works at nintendo says Tekken X street fighter will come out 2021 Kappa
[0:27:40] <$Superdandy96> Anyone else remember how you needed the OP gems if dare to play online?
[0:27:40] <@Menitta> I want a CVS3 so Dudley and Vanessa can team up
[0:27:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> Capcom was just on the other shit in the the early 2010s
[0:27:45] <ikantreeed> Cammikasa?
[0:27:49] <BurdRightsActivist> Halo 2 wraith boost sounds 4Head
[0:27:51] <bigshedman> All these Tekken characters getting projectiles in this game was so fucking dumb
[0:27:52] <%Solidnick18> YEE
[0:27:53] <+Superbro64> I swear by the statement that this game gets 2 points from me if you could just turn off gems entirely in options or something
[0:27:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:27:57] <SomersaultJustice> no red health
[0:27:58] <%Solidnick18> i remember when sam did that
[0:28:04] <FlamingNarwhal> @Menitta i want cvs3 so Juri and Luong can team up
[0:28:08] <BalloniWright> It can't be Ed since this was way before sfv
[0:28:13] <@Menitta> ooooh thats good
[0:28:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Superbro64 There is, there's a fan patch that removes em
[0:28:20] <lazerscraper> @iskyhunteri i hate that shit so bad
[0:28:27] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is this hsit modded?
[0:28:31] <%Jack8274> Wait isn't that the guy from Revengance?
[0:28:36] <FlamingNarwhal> @BalloniWright ed is in sf4 in balrogs ending
[0:28:37] <%ChoculaUltra> Sam was clearly one of Heihachi's many bastards left around the world. Like Lars!
[0:28:37] <andre11dr> @solidnick18 I mean he kinda did
[0:28:41] <+Superbro64> @AlteisenReiseZ well I'll be darned
[0:28:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> I want CvS3 so Angel and R.Mika and sit on me
[0:28:51] <yeahthatalex> The damage sajamTasty
[0:29:01] <andre11dr> When he lost the sword he started fighting like snake
[0:29:03] <+TopTieramisu> @BalloniWright these are obviously skin mods. not official
[0:29:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Superbro64 adds the console characters as well
[0:29:23] <ISkyHunterI> that gem sounds like something straight out of a mobile game NotLikeThis
[0:29:28] <+TopTieramisu> and ed was indeed in balrog's ending in sf4 as a skinny kid with a hoodie
[0:29:30] <lazerscraper> the bound system from T6 and Tag 2 is in this
[0:29:33] <$Superdandy96> The game is still fun, I just wish THIS was the base game
[0:29:42] <MattDemers> Is the Jetstream Sam skin a mod??
[0:29:46] <anarchistPastry> what are these costumes omfg
[0:29:46] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:29:48] <%Solidnick18> sick
[0:29:49] <FlamingNarwhal> all the skins are mods
[0:29:54] <lazerscraper> seeing SF characters doing bound juggles is sick
[0:29:55] <BalloniWright> @TopTieramisu But people made mods for this game Years later?
[0:29:56] <BenjiCake> mods everywhere
[0:30:05] <BurdRightsActivist> @MattDemers it's a gem
[0:30:06] <+TopTieramisu> @BalloniWright ed was introduced in balrog's sf4 ending
[0:30:09] <FlamingNarwhal> @BalloniWright people STILL make mods for this game man
[0:30:10] <%Setsuna_seiei> people who think this game is better without gems are insane. The reason for so many timeouts, besides dumb scaling, was the lack of gems. The game was designed around them being active/used
[0:30:12] <@Menitta> i hate this because it legit looks fun
[0:30:13] <%gatorafan> I didn't expect something with Ogre's build to be able to move like he does daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:30:27] <+BaronBattle> Jetstream Sam one of the coolest characters of all time, free
[0:30:28] <+HolyGriddles> The actual in-game costumes are sick. Don’t know why he’s still keeping the old mods
[0:30:30] <%ThisIsLloyd> oh big mac i see
[0:30:31] <BlackermanZX> sam looking good
[0:30:32] <+wicketpelican> Woolie likes two fighting game archetypes. Boxer dodger and Big Green Person
[0:30:34] <%Solidnick18> get in menitta
[0:30:40] <+Cuon_Alpinus> reggia aint got the purple stuff :(
[0:30:46] <anarchistPastry> "no problem!"
[0:30:52] <+Superbro64> @Setsuna_seiei I have never been more confused and frustrated then when I had to look in the pages of pages of gems on the gems screen, to make loadouts
[0:30:58] <@Menitta> I kept both my 360 and Vita copies lmao
[0:30:58] <Doublemint_Dave_> So what are the biggest problems with this game?
[0:30:58] <%Solidnick18> woolieSPICE
[0:30:58] <%Setsuna_seiei> dont remember who decided that normals all doing roughly the same damage was a bright ida
[0:31:00] <andre11dr> Again, the mods are kinda hiding the hideous art style the game has
[0:31:04] <$Superdandy96> I remember my mains were... Paul and Cody I wanna say? I used the swap suits
[0:31:05] <BurdRightsActivist> @Doublemint_Dave_ gems
[0:31:07] <+Superbro64> I get it, but I would prefer a game without them.
[0:31:11] <+wicketpelican> @Doublemint_Dave_ gem system is bulshit
[0:31:16] <Triplicat> 30/60/90 boys
[0:31:22] <%Solidnick18> alright
[0:31:26] <%biggdaddymike> Does still have b1 here?
[0:31:28] <Doublemint_Dave_> I have no concept of the gems, what they do?
[0:31:30] <%Setsuna_seiei> @Superbro64 the amount of gems is insane, but eliminating them outright breaks the game baalnce since the game is designed around using and combining them
[0:31:34] <+LazyEyed_Jalen> i was shocked to find out a few months ago this game has an extremely active discord community
[0:31:38] <%Setsuna_seiei> think CvS2 without grooves
[0:31:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> Imagine a fg with a boxer who's a big green Aztec man with boxing gloves made of fire, Woolie would die on the spot
[0:31:41] <ZeludeRose> did they ever even patch the 30/60/90 or nah
[0:31:42] <+TopTieramisu> a lot of the problems with sfxt were fixed but it was already too late
[0:31:44] <PkSilent01> I think the stage is messing with the compression
[0:31:49] <+brudus_maximus> I clicked on the stream. I almost lost my fucking mind thinking I missed Jetstream Sam got put in a fighting game before I realized it was modded.
[0:31:51] <+TopTieramisu> first impressions are way too important
[0:31:54] <+the22cstomp> this game is very cult classic
[0:31:57] <$Superdandy96> I really wanted to get good with Julia but god I sucked as her
[0:32:04] <+Superbro64> @Setsuna_seiei there are also just gems that are outright better then others, which are dlc that have to be purchased seperately
[0:32:08] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[0:32:08] <+Superbro64> regardless of mods or not
[0:32:09] <%RyanGelatin> Street Fighter X Tekken was my first ever fighting game because i asked my mom to get me Just Cause 2, but they didnt have any copies at Gamestop so she got me sfxt, because "It seemed like somthing youd like" and i had no reference for other fighting games so i loved it and was completely unaware of the gems.
[0:32:15] <yeahthatalex> sajamTasty
[0:32:25] <SomersaultJustice> Misogi all day
[0:32:31] <BalloniWright> Use Pandora or you're a pussy Kappa
[0:32:36] <+tuchpi> @ZeludeRose I think you have to do too much work to rebalance everything to fix the fixed damage
[0:32:38] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Is anyone else's stream crusty?
[0:32:39] <+LazyEyed_Jalen> Use the gems REGGI gwdSlap gwdSlap gwdSlap
[0:32:40] <lazerscraper> SACRIFICE
[0:32:43] <%Setsuna_seiei> @Superbro64 those wer the pre-order gems, competively they could just ban those, but online thats completely scuffed
[0:32:46] <@Menitta> Dude SFXT was also my first fighter but I give that credit more to P4A because that game is good.
[0:32:50] <ISkyHunterI> @RyanGelatin Man you got scammed, just cause 2 was awesome LUL
[0:32:51] <sunkenrose> Why did they make this a tag game? It would’ve been just fine 1v1.
[0:32:52] <FlamingNarwhal> woolie and reggie really arent farming enough gold
[0:32:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> @reverend_roscoe twitch bitrate hates this
[0:32:58] <$Superdandy96> Gotta jump when Ogre does the slam
[0:32:59] <FlamingNarwhal> how will they ever use the shop system
[0:33:02] <@Menitta> it was at least my first SF game
[0:33:04] <%RyanGelatin> woolieMIRIN
[0:33:08] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Ok, I figured that's what it was
[0:33:11] <%Setsuna_seiei> @sunkenrose you only need to KO 1 teammate for the win
[0:33:12] <%Irridium> my first fighter was Tekken 2
[0:33:14] <pookam> is there snapback in this game?
[0:33:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL

[0:33:49] <DatAsuna> I remember not understanding the UI for quarter circles lol
[0:33:49] <%Solidnick18> oooh is that death?
[0:33:50] <lazerscraper> @sunkenrose i think Tag 2 came out the same year sl
[0:33:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Can I be real with yall? my first fighting was playing Garou on an online emulator in my middle school's computer lab
[0:33:59] <$Superdandy96> Legit, if there’s was another fighting game with this style of combat and 2v2 nature, I’d totally play it
[0:34:01] <%Solidnick18> Juri Kreygasm
[0:34:01] <%Setsuna_seiei> @Superbro64 there's a resurgence of tournaments for SFxT this year.
[0:34:03] <DatAsuna> So I would try and pres down then diagonal down then forward for a rotation lol
[0:34:03] <andre11dr> My first fighter was CVS2
[0:34:03] <whiteblacklight74> WE LAMING IT OUT TONIGHT?
[0:34:03] <%RyanGelatin> yea id say having sfxt as my first fighting game kinda steered me away from them for a while

[0:48:01] <bigshedman> @FuqBoiSlim This game went way too far with making Yoshi goofy. Likewise, it "reinterpreted" a lot of Tekken characters very poorly, like Bryan and Xiaoju.

[1:01:31] <%Asuterisuku> King has an Alex costume that looks pretty sweet.
[1:01:31] <%Solidnick18> samus*
[1:01:36] <+Superbro64> I WAS RAISED IN IT
[1:01:36] <%VaudeVille_Villain_> Samus Neener works extremely well
[1:01:36] <ZeludeRose> very hot controversial take: infamous 2 was a good game
[1:01:38] <%Josef_Stryker> I can never get enough of Mary McGlynn's voice
[1:01:40] <+Superbro64> MOLDED BY IT
[1:01:41] <framewindowcleaner> @BurdRightsActivist I know, I just refuse to believe it
[1:01:42] <@Menitta> HOPE!
[1:01:48] <%Solidnick18> Goooo kratos
[1:01:52] <KidKaiser23> Cole from 2014 Forest Hills Drive
[1:01:57] <ZeludeRose> in what world will you ever charge anything enough to actually land it?
[1:01:59] <ReimuHakureiShrine> That recovery length for Hugo's grab was mad fast. Holy shit.
[1:02:07] <KidKaiser23> Ya know, Lil Ole Jermaine with every ounce of strength in his veins
[1:02:08] <+HolyGriddles> Infamous was always good. Same people who made Sky Cooper and Ghosts of Tsushima. Great devs
[1:02:11] <point4effort> @ZeludeRose Its all mind games
[1:02:20] <@Menitta> Oh yeah didn't Dhalsim and Sagat team up to save the children
[1:02:29] <%Irridium> COLE P R O T O C O L
[1:02:34] <+HolyGriddles> *Sly Cooper
[1:02:51] <bogeyhaha> Yup.Good games all around @HolyGriddles
[1:02:57] <ZeludeRose> @point4effort im assuming generally the moves you have to charge work in tandem with the super? like, super covers the answer for the normal move?
[1:03:07] <@Menitta> why does Samus look so good in this
[1:03:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:12] <BlackermanZX> that samus mod is pretty cool
[1:03:14] <KidKaiser23> Y’all remember when Kratos spent his Holiday with Ong Bak?
[1:03:31] <+Superbro64> @Menitta She was a costume for the base game. Of COURSE she would look good
[1:03:34] <+Superbro64> Why wouldnt she? Kappa
[1:03:36] <KidKaiser23> It was so nice watching them eat mangoes together
[1:04:12] <%Solidnick18> reggie pls
[1:04:15] <pookam> time for pandora
[1:04:16] <Triplicat> damage is so low christ
[1:04:47] <KidKaiser23> That was hot
[1:04:51] <+aishman> Man it's really cool of Nintendo give 'em Samus
[1:04:52] <nimu290> sagot at his finest annoying
[1:04:57] <+aishman> Despite this game not being on any nintendo console
[1:05:01] <DatAsuna> @Menitta bolds colours and nice shading, helps even with relatively low res
[1:05:06] <bogeyhaha> MIKASA
[1:05:14] <%Asuterisuku> Wow that's a game I haven't thought about in AGES.
[1:05:16] <ZeludeRose> can someone edit the 69 face tat onto kazuya and call the post 3hirty6ixty9inty

[1:05:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> A Lolipop Chainsaw reference in 2020, you truly love to see it
[1:05:42] <+jiggy_snipe> a portal to MvC3 Kappa
[1:05:45] <framewindowcleaner> MIKASA
[1:05:47] <ReimuHakureiShrine> They should bring back the old CAPCOM engine used for SF4 in their next game.
[1:06:13] <+Superbro64> Pandora's Box contains all your hopes and desires. So an actually good Capcom game at launch is in there somewhere.
[1:06:15] <+Superbro64> LUL
[1:06:16] <nimu290> that was a limp super
[1:06:18] <ZeludeRose> @ReimuHakureiShrine they might use RE Engine honestly
[1:06:19] <%Asuterisuku> @ReimuHakureiShrine They technically never stopped using it; Monster Hunter World is still on MT Framework.
[1:06:19] <KidKaiser23> Oh wow! It’s Darksiders 2 Man
[1:06:25] <pookam> problem
[1:06:26] <+Ledaxel> you mean dimps? @ReimuHakureiShrine
[1:06:28] <%Asuterisuku> RE Engine would be good though.
[1:06:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> wasn't that MT Framework? RE Engine is just a better version of that tbh.
[1:06:37] <%Irridium> all this talk of Pandora's Box reminds me of Legendary
[1:06:46] <%biggdaddymike> SourPls
[1:06:48] <framewindowcleaner> E R E N Intensifies
[1:07:04] <KidKaiser23> Remember guys, Mikasa is better because she is A S I A N
[1:07:18] <@Solidus_113> last of her kind Kappa
[1:07:22] <@Solidus_113> very rare
[1:07:25] <+Superbro64> Oro was in here BEFORE he got in SFV?? PogChamp
[1:07:30] <ReimuHakureiShrine> I know the dudes who work on SF5 mostly knew MT Framework and were forced to learn UE4, but I think it'd prob be better for them to go back to what they already knew before.
[1:07:30] <+Superbro64> How could I not know?? Kappa
[1:07:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Her strong ORIENTAL genetics make her a combat natural
[1:07:33] <ZeludeRose> @Asterisuki tbf i remember hearing they only used MT for World for internal setback reasons
[1:07:37] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:07:38] <KidKaiser23> She is pure just like Baiken
[1:07:52] <%Asuterisuku> Well yeah, but RE Engine has enough similarities...
[1:07:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> I want to correct chat but AOT spoilers so LUL
[1:08:11] <ZeludeRose> @Th3SmartAlec you saying that is a spoiler lmao
[1:08:13] <+Ledaxel> @ReimuHakureiShrine whats the point of that when you want to adapt to new things
[1:08:14] <%Josef_Stryker> The Ogre the only Aztec fighting game character not jobbed?
[1:08:19] <ZeludeRose> LUL
[1:08:24] <@Solidus_113> you could've just stayed silent
[1:08:25] <%biggdaddymike> Spirit jab?
[1:08:27] <nimu290> i see nthing wrong
[1:08:32] <nimu290> nothing
[1:08:32] <framewindowcleaner> @Th3SmartAlec I know right? I have to control myself with how much wrong the chats is right now.
[1:08:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> what do you kean??? is Mikasa not an azn queen???
[1:08:35] <KidKaiser23> Untainted from sperm that did NOT soak in the Rising Sun
[1:08:47] <%Asuterisuku> King has an anti-air grab on DP Punch.
[1:08:47] <ZombyEmblem> spoiling aot is an act of politeness
[1:08:49] <+Ledaxel> you wouldnt stay with the same shit for 20+ years just because you miss it
[1:08:50] <Doublemint_Dave_> man I just love King
[1:08:53] <%Josef_Stryker> I'm guessing King is modded to look like Armour King?
[1:09:09] <ZeludeRose> Ledaxel and say everything i hear makes me glad i stopped caring
[1:09:24] <ReimuHakureiShrine> @Ledaxel I mean yeah they spent all that time learning UE, but if their main forte is using the other engine, maybe they can give it a go again? idk
[1:09:27] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:09:35] <GodGoshDarnIt> whens Juri @WoolieVersus
[1:09:40] <BlackermanZX> so whack LUL

[1:13:36] <+Superbro64> I'm in shock and awe how garbage SFV Juri's design is, when compared to how good SF4 Juri.

[1:25:21] <+Dova573> Also one life bar sucks
[1:25:25] <@Menitta> I would prefer both characters losing
[1:25:27] <huskarl_zap> Wheres the chaos space marine marduk?
[1:25:29] <%Irridium> I strongly prefer two separate bars
[1:25:32] <+FunStuffAvenue> that juri outfit is nice
[1:25:33] <DaCheekyOne> Wait, how old is AOT? Was it a thing in 2013?
[1:25:38] <%Jetzord> if the damage wasn't so low in this game two bars would be better
[1:25:40] <KidKaiser23> When one of y’all picking Sparda?
[1:25:48] <@Menitta> YOOOOOOOOOOO

[1:26:45] <huskarl_zap> cancel moobot
[1:26:51] <@Menitta> thats a moral victory
[1:27:00] <ZeludeRose> @FunStuffAvenue yeah but the main reason it's so cool is cuz it's such a risk, but the risk is almost never worth it
[1:27:01] <@Menitta> https://parsecgaming.com/join/1fF6Rc9CAwlFtOLFTtMsAAx5qli/90faa8a1

[1:28:09] <%Xero_J> I'm surprised there's no mod to force Mega Man, Pacman and Cole in here
[1:28:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> this actually via the games online or parsec?
[1:28:22] <ZeludeRose> apparently there's a patch for getting the characters on pc
[1:28:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> if parsec someone wanna send me the link
[1:28:25] <%Asuterisuku> Parsec.
[1:28:27] <@Menitta> yeah them fighting each other is the last thing on their mind
[1:28:30] <LKHamJams> Oh this game is horrible online.
[1:28:35] <+FunStuffAvenue> NO WAY
[1:28:39] <DatAsuna> apparently it has to be a new link every match
[1:28:44] <Doublemint_Dave_> bro what the fuck is this stage
[1:28:52] <gamefan6219> I thought that was Kin wearing a hood at first.

[1:31:15] <%Irridium> I hard skipped this shit man LUL
[1:31:23] <lazerscraper> win theme for a tekken team is the T6 intro theme PogChamp
[1:31:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:31:25] <@Solidus_113> Nobody's picked Asuka yet
[1:31:29] <gamefan6219> Megaman was in this
[1:31:29] <framewindowcleaner> Not enough timeouts, this can't X TEKKEN
[1:31:33] <%jinking79> lots of wins by Time Out
[1:31:49] <@Menitta> I'm gonna pick Asuka and Cammy
[1:31:51] <ZeludeRose> gougi is balanced gems cuz you can't make custom decks
[1:31:53] <gamefan6219> @WoolieVersus remember boxart megaman?
[1:31:57] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> X Tekken is some precious fucking memories
[1:31:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> Didn't they just take Gougi out anyway?
[1:32:02] <huskarl_zap> >training stage Dansgame
[1:32:09] <ZeludeRose> no what gougi's still there
[1:32:14] <%Irridium> Wide Dante
[1:32:15] <huskarl_zap> DansGame
[1:32:21] <HamFamJam> that's one chunky Dante
[1:32:21] <framewindowcleaner> Jin is DMC 2 Dante LUL
[1:32:22] <ZeludeRose> literally just played the game 2 days ago lol gougi's alive and well
[1:32:29] <KidKaiser23> Dante been EATIN
[1:32:29] <gamefan6219> steve is just balrog
[1:32:32] <%Asuterisuku> It was Dante's best coat.
[1:32:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> alright I'm tripping I heard they made a mode where it was disabled or smth
[1:32:46] <+Dova573> It would have been cooler if steves projectile was a hangman jab
[1:32:46] <ReimuHakureiShrine> Steve is just Ed
[1:32:53] <ReimuHakureiShrine> He even has the Psycho Upper lol
[1:32:55] <+Dova573> I mean Hitman
[1:32:57] <+Dova573> jab
[1:32:59] <ZeludeRose> if they have a non-gougi mode then no one uses it, all the tournaments use gougi
[1:33:01] <KidKaiser23> The idea behind this Sakura outfit is great
[1:33:07] <%Solidnick18> sakura Kreygasm
[1:33:15] <+FunStuffAvenue> yo he's got flick jabs
[1:33:22] <+Dova573> nvm he got them
[1:33:24] <+FunStuffAvenue> like uhhhh that was ippo right
[1:33:31] <ReimuHakureiShrine> They predticted Dante Ken before the SFV costume Kappa
[1:33:44] <%Asuterisuku> No electrics from Dante?
[1:33:58] <@Menitta> The most unfortunate thing about this game is that the 2D interpretations of Tekken characters are trapped in this game
[1:34:00] <gamefan6219> that's fake. Dante isn't using his sword
[1:34:04] <%Asuterisuku> I like Ed's Nero costume more.
[1:34:12] <ZeludeRose> if dante loses he's gonna say dumb shit on twitter again to blow off steam
[1:34:26] <+Dova573> Man I wish ed dint have that weird no motion for his specials thing
[1:34:34] <KidKaiser23> Dante had too many Sweet Potato Pies, they went straight to his Thighs

[1:44:23] <nimu290> slim bob was nice
[1:44:26] <gamefan6219> Bob the builder?
[1:44:38] <%Xero_J> I remember thin Bob was funny because he kept trying to do moves he had when he was fat and failing
[1:44:41] <ReimuHakureiShrine> When are we getting Skinny Rufus for SF6
[1:44:50] <%Wool> I can't tell if the Windows disconnect sound is coming from me or the stream lmao
[1:44:56] <%Irridium> final character for new tekken season will be thin bob
[1:44:56] <lazerscraper> they give the tekken tag theme so much love
[1:45:00] <nimu290> stream
[1:45:03] <DatAsuna> it's stream

[2:34:34] <Ryong> SEE WHAT i MEAN @tidalwafer
[2:34:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> moobot...
[2:34:39] <%Solidnick18> this is the new queens blade
[2:34:49] <%Solidnick18> SeriousSloth
[2:34:50] <Triplicat> go away moobot
[2:34:55] <Thunderhog> Boot scilencing the composer. you hate to see it
[2:34:56] <%skylerpilot> it is something Woolie would do to troll chat, etc... But I don't think he would do it intentionally so as to give something like this more exposure
[2:35:01] <%FenixSeraph> I imagine they're going to polish them later on but these character models look RWBY-tier
[2:35:15] <%Asuterisuku> So you have about seven seconds if you fill it all the way up.
[2:35:27] <%Asuterisuku> RWBY's models got better later.
[2:35:35] <$SilverRoddo> I’m guessing we should draw Woolie Vs as a Queen’s Blade.
[2:35:36] <EmptyFist> not gonna lie. That punch looks a lil lame
[2:35:42] <%Wool> uhhh
[2:35:44] <%FenixSeraph> the character art is pretty good, and the models themselves could look great with better shaders
[2:35:59] <Ryong> @Asuterisuku early seasons had some really weird issues with the hands
[2:36:08] <%FenixSeraph> it makes me think of how trash KOFXIV looked at first before they put decent shaders onto them
[2:36:16] <+jetjagger222> the keyframes are kind of jank though
[2:36:18] <%Wool> it only shows list for P1
[2:36:19] <%Asuterisuku> Use the DP's iFrames to avoid the explosion woolieGASM
[2:36:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Queen's Conquest
[2:36:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1318434198781386755
[2:36:50] <%FenixSeraph> I'm guessing the animations will be touched up to become more fluid in later updates
[2:36:55] <GVGguy> I feel you should be able to...
[2:37:06] <@Solidus_113> Next character coming on Halloween
[2:37:10] <$SilverRoddo> Not Travis Touchdown is pretty cool.
[2:37:18] <SomersaultJustice> that's pretty neat
[2:37:24] <%Asuterisuku> DP Air Throw, then.
[2:37:26] <%FenixSeraph> this lady looks like Cowgirl Aerith
[2:37:28] <SomersaultJustice> it's like a dp air throw
[2:37:32] <YakumoYomi> When I saw "Queen's Blade", this is not what I was expecting.
[2:37:34] <Triplicat> c-nanaya DP but less cool
[2:37:44] <%Asuterisuku> Reminds me of Tianhuo.
[2:37:48] <%Asuterisuku> Volcanic Crash.
[2:37:50] <%Wool> I think both hits have to connect
[2:38:20] <%Asuterisuku> Wait what?
[2:38:26] <%Irridium> what
[2:38:27] <%Asuterisuku> Charge time instead of button strength?
[2:38:33] <%Solidnick18> that's ky
[2:39:37] <%Asuterisuku> I've never been fond of charge characters, but that's pretty wild.
[2:40:14] <SomersaultJustice> yep
[2:40:21] <Ryong> that's just Jin's astral
[2:40:23] <Ryong> sort of

[2:51:56] <%FenixSeraph> the models themselves are nicer than RWBY's, but they need better shaders and more fluid animations
[2:52:00] <%Asuterisuku> The animations could use more frames.
[2:52:58] <%Wool> wow that's a big DP

[2:54:03] <$Invlux> @GVGguy sick licks, dude
[2:54:15] <GVGguy> Thanks, man!
[2:54:26] <%Asuterisuku> This game needs more time in the oven.
[2:54:32] <%Asuterisuku> But the designs are pretty cool.
[2:55:12] <Potatoidea> Venicia's icon looks like Hat Girl

[2:59:06] <+Synthos3> Cutscenes:The fighting game.
[2:59:08] <+secretspud> Ultimate poverty
[2:59:17] <Doublemint_Dave_> This game feels like purgatory
[2:59:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Isn't Queen's Blade the anime with the tig old bitties?
[2:59:31] <%Wool> yes
[2:59:49] <stevenellis386> false advertising
[2:59:53] <%ChoculaUltra> I feel like there should be more animations between animations if that makes any sense.
[2:59:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Her boobs are almost normal sized, what is this?
[3:00:16] <+secretspud> there isn't as much piss as I would expect with this title
[3:00:16] <lewdiversal> This aint the queens blade I was expecting
[3:00:26] <snapplejax> @ChoculaUltra those are called frames

[3:00:50] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[3:00:53] <+ChestMimik> They better keep that in and call it tech
[3:00:54] <Ynkubus_> Key frames to be more precise
[3:00:56] <+secretspud> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:00:58] <Sulfur_Boride> This game's actually called Queens Blade? They could get away with it with the lack of the apostrophe?
[3:01:06] <%ChoculaUltra> I woulda said frames but wouldn't adding more frames ultimately alter how many frames are in a move?
[3:01:18] <Mnemonicjohnny> *working as intended*
[3:01:43] <GVGguy> I think the term you're looking for is "in-betweens"? @ChoculaUltra
[3:01:44] <myfaceisapotato> dude this guy has the weakest hitsounds ever for a big stupid weapon guy
[3:01:59] <%Kriss1827> @sulfur_boride i believe its called queens conquest
[3:02:01] <Ynkubus_> Key frames determines the important steps of the animation, the frames just covers the whole animation in general and fps
[3:02:24] <shadepman> this game giving GG a run for its money
[3:03:02] <Sulfur_Boride> Hope the devs take this criticism of their animation in earnest
[3:03:26] <+cvp5127> queens blade Leh UL
[3:03:28] <+PR0swagonist> this is not the queens blade i know
[3:03:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> They haven't been playing this game for the whole stream, have they?
[3:03:52] <Maleicus> no
[3:04:00] <%RyTYoung> @commandersqueaks no they played street fighter X tekken
[3:04:05] <%Kriss1827> no they were playing SFxT before
[3:04:07] <Sulfur_Boride> @CommanderSqueaks There's only 2 characters, so hell to the nah
[3:04:08] <@Solidus_113> you missed modded cross tekken
[3:04:10] <Mnemonicjohnny> @WoolieVersus Yo Woolz, you planning on taking a look at Cerebrawl any time in the future? 2v2 co-op assist fighter (P2 has control when called in), Skullgirls-level animation, soundtrack by 2Mello. Seems right up your alley.
[3:04:13] <%ChoculaUltra> the cross up?!
[3:04:23] <Sulfur_Boride> Dammit. I missed modded X Tekken? damn
