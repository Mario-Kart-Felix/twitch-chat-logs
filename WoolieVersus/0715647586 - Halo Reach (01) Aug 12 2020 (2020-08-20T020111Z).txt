[0:19:58] <%brachydios777> It would be appropriate
[0:19:59] <xenprecs> Woolie getting into Halo has been the best thing about 2020
[0:20:02] <%The_Swedish_X> I just liked that they used the trailers to tell some story instead just selling the game.
[0:20:04] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @theshisno stop, stop, I can only get so wet
[0:20:06] <alrobot2014> if you burn it at least film it while reciting the words of Lord Cole

[0:20:27] <%brachydios777> Big Lies
[0:20:27] <@Menitta> HE HAS ARMOR
[0:20:27] <%mikessdd> yeah 4 and 5 marketing is lots of lie
[0:20:29] <%Javaa01> Too bad the lies were better then the final product
[0:20:30] <%Sgt_Rorschach> The marketing didn’t lie, they just changed the plot post-marketing
[0:20:30] <+A0N33> As long as they're not hype ass lies, true
[0:20:31] <%yhom_tork> SHUT UP ITS COOL
[0:20:31] <Coystick> I will mad for you
[0:20:34] <%derap41> As long as its good
[0:20:34] <marvel877> Why a cloak though?

[0:20:36] <+jiggy_snipe> cuz it's cool
[0:20:38] <Djinnazz> not even close
[0:20:38] <prime_name> They're different enough
[0:20:39] <+generalve> THE THING
[0:20:41] <%phatmac16> BIG LIES

[0:20:43] <+Nomad_Scholar> I love that Reach's Live Action trailer is canon
[0:20:45] <+GarboArbo> They are different enough
[0:20:45] <dinnydanny777> Dead Space is a rip off of Event Horizon
[0:20:45] <Lieutenant_America> yes except no
[0:20:46] <+paladinstarbuster> necromorphs are worse
[0:20:46] <%DSD24> Necromorphs are Madness based
[0:20:46] <alrobot2014> @Menitta protect from sand erosion i guess?
[0:20:47] <+portlandsunshine> The marketing for 3 was lies too. THe whole battle didn't happen
[0:20:50] <+Juriasu> hey man eva-02 wearing the tarp like a cloak is the sickest thing ever
[0:20:50] <%phatmac16> NAH
[0:20:55] <%ScreamLord> Power Armor withcloth bags and cloaks bolted onto it is badass
[0:20:56] <%Solareon_> Solareon_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Dinothunder is the actual best theme, I’ll die on that hill. Thanks for the good ass Halo content.
[0:20:58] <DigitalJoshie> both are terrible body horror
[0:20:58] <Second_Omega> Necromorphs are more psychological in effect
[0:20:59] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus They're both ripoffs of the Zerg and xenomorphs
[0:20:59] <%yhom_tork> Kreygasm
[0:21:00] <dinnydanny777> Dead Space is video game Event Horizon
[0:21:01] <+RowenCleric> dead space has more weird culty crap to make it feel different
[0:21:03] <%brachydios777> They’re kinda similar
[0:21:04] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> KreyGasm
[0:21:04] <GManx0> I dont think they were meant as lies. They just had no actual idea what they were doing with story
[0:21:05] <Second_Omega> Both horrifying tho
[0:21:07] <Darren716> Just skipping ODST?
[0:21:08] <%yhom_tork> LuL
[0:21:08] <+generalve> shhhh
[0:21:09] <marvel877> Similar, but the Necromorphs go HARD on the religious motif stuff.
[0:21:09] <%slppanther29> ooof

[0:21:18] <+ren173> @Darren716 ODST ISN'T OUT YET dingus
[0:21:20] <+Ragnvaldr_AGH> Reach and 2 are the best
[0:21:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa

[0:21:21] <%brachydios777> LUL
[0:21:22] <Darren716> Why not just wait?
[0:21:23] <xenprecs> @darren716 ODST isn’t on PC yet
[0:21:25] <CISphil> Halo Reach is great, shutup!
[0:21:26] <%slppanther29> doodSad But... I like Reach
[0:21:26] <mesamus> UUFFF
[0:21:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Smug V Best V
[0:21:27] <%MacabreOpus> I distinctly remember the 'Believe' ad campaign expecting fights on that level of close-quarters combat and horror-inducing stress but alas, it couldn't be. Halo 3 is incredible regardless
[0:21:28] <+ren173> Reach
[0:21:29] <Targical> Flood, infested, reapers, necromorphs. All the same essentially
[0:21:30] <andre11dr> The Necromorphs are cooler than the flood in my opinion, but then again, i didn't play 3
[0:21:30] <dereks0n> That’s right, it’s actually Number One
[0:21:31] <%DSD24> @Darren716 ODST isn't out yet unfortunately
[0:21:31] <Darren716> Isnt odst coming out like next week?
[0:21:32] <%derap41> Reach best MP
[0:21:32] <%ScreamLord> Reach has the best customization system
[0:21:33] <%yhom_tork> reach is great
[0:21:34] <+ntfth> LUL
[0:21:35] <+mechslayer71> Reach is great
[0:21:37] <raikagelord1> Reach is AMAZING.
[0:21:38] <DatAsuna> TFW no dead space extraction 2
[0:21:43] <%BonewheelVanguard> Y'all better read Fall of Reach at the start of the next stream
[0:21:44] <+QueequegTheater> He is wrong, 4 has the best campaign Kappa
[0:21:45] <DigitalJoshie> I LOVE reach
[0:21:46] <ghoulishcripple> reach is a lovely game
[0:21:46] <@Menitta> Reach was the first non-nintendo game I owned
[0:21:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> We need more emotes with V, Reggie and Minh xD
[0:21:52] <GManx0> Has V seen the Unraveled Halo Episode

[0:21:53] <BritishTyrannosaur> 4's campagin is bae fight me
[0:21:55] <%brave_sj> Cheer500 Listening to theFlood audiobook made me realize how cheesy these books are when you hear them out loud, but at least you know how to pronounce Mjolnir, unlike the guy that did the official audiobooks. You do know how to pronounce Mjolnir, right?
[0:21:58] <%GrumbleGrouse> Reach is aight. kinda short and easier
[0:21:58] <+YharnamNighthawk> How long until Woolie plays Destiny :think:
[0:22:05] <+generalve> the what ?

[0:27:30] <$jake5713> Cheer500 Hey Spartans! Reach was my 1st Halo game and my 1st 360 game so it holds a special place for me. Woolie (not a spoiler), Smart AI in Halo are unique & can't be backed up cuz they're formatted from the brains of deceased UNSC officers. So they're completely one of a kind, Cortana more so because she was cloned from Dr. Bad Lady's(Halo's smartest living person) living tissue, hence the importance of getting her back in 3.
[0:27:31] <@Menitta> THere's that ultimate Halo theme on youtube that mashes up every halo theme and the intigration of Reach's theme is fucking woolieGASM
[0:27:31] <poisin224> Reach has the best OST dont @ me

[0:29:37] <%CraftofPaper> GET INTO SHOOTER GAMES
[0:29:39] <+VanitasRSK> that's rad

[0:30:10] <%brachydios777> Kinda
[0:30:11] <$jake5713> Operator helmet is still the best.
[0:30:11] <+Zyquux> That's exactly what it is now
[0:30:12] <Ynkubus_> The old cred system was great until you got half the stuff, then it sucked
[0:30:13] <+Reaverund> In OG there was currency you used to buy equipment
[0:30:14] <marvel877> This was all in game unlocks originally.
[0:30:15] <+QueequegTheater> STACKER PogChamp
[0:30:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oof, that SFX is loud D:
[0:30:16] <%RyTYoung> I wanna see that sick Emile helmet

[0:30:18] <BritishTyrannosaur> love the halo 1 customisation tbh
[0:30:18] <%slppanther29> You got credits that you used to buy armors and effects
[0:30:22] <simulationbard> It's a battle pass but it's free and always around
[0:30:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Stacker PogChamp
[0:30:26] <+Pequod1> You could just choose what you wanted to buy with credits instead of a stupid linear progression with no choice lol
[0:30:27] <%phatmac16> SFX IS LOUD
[0:30:29] <%Valask> I absolutely love the Elite customization
[0:30:29] <%Sgt_Rorschach> V has an approximate knowledge of Halo facts

[0:30:46] <+Zyquux> Originally it was tied to your rank that could only feasibly be leveled in multiplayer
[0:30:48] <%The_Swedish_X> I loved Reach customization.
[0:30:49] <Pizza_Mezza> You can get codes from Doritos to unlock double xp

[0:57:04] <TheHylianGuard> The original DOOM has a sprint, so not a very new mechanic
[0:57:05] <%mikessdd> SPARTAN II's are bigger and stronger you'll see when you stand next to Jorge haha
[0:57:06] <DatAsuna> 2s are tall, that's all you need
[0:57:06] <$GiantPapaDoug> yeah 3's didn't go through all the augmentations that 3 did. cuz of how many 2's died or were maimed by the augments
[0:57:07] <+VietcongSamurai> Sarcasm chat LUL
[0:57:07] <solidgoldtoast> SPARTAN IIs are the big badasses. SPARTAN IIIs are shitty mass produced soldiers

[0:57:10] <BritishTyrannosaur> noooo sprint bad

[0:57:13] <$whiskeybuisness> it plugs in just above your butt
[0:57:13] <wintrysoma> isn't 3 running faster than 5 sprinting
[0:57:13] <dinnydanny777> I love the sprint, all my homies love the sprint
[0:57:13] <+novacrusader727> Whoosh
[0:57:14] <+Doctor_Stew> sprint as equipment bad
[0:57:15] <RushUnplugged> hoes very mad about normal FPS mechanics
[0:57:18] <%Ancopro> everyone loved at at the start, people started to hate it in retrospect
[0:57:18] <+ntfth> 3s were War Orphans offered vengeance on the Covenant and then sent out on suicide missions. Only 2 out of 300 survived their first mission.
[0:57:18] <Dynamo_Commando> What's the big deal with sprint in Halo?
[0:57:19] <BritishTyrannosaur> hahha spartan go zooooon
[0:57:20] <%DesertPenguin> Sprint is a "power-up" fuck that
[0:57:21] <+GuyNooN> loved sprint?????????? was he alive in 2010??
[0:57:27] <Targical> On add, yeah
[0:57:28] <+evbites> thats better
[0:57:28] <idiotscampaign> the main difference between spartan gens are how ethically they are sourced
[0:57:29] <+duskrush> I prefer Verizon
[0:57:30] <+IntrepidEye> III's didn't get Mjolnir for cost reasons but their contrary to popular belief III's are as good as II's.

[0:57:31] <Crippl3> @guynoon it's a joke
[0:57:32] <%huskarl_zap> 2s> 3s but the revenge plot is cool
[0:57:36] <Louie_Salmon> That is kind of hilarious that Woolie just took that at face value
[0:57:36] <+Pequod1> @idiotscampaign lol
[0:57:41] <%doomerskeletor13> @guynoon Have you heard of sarcasm
[0:57:41] <extradopeness> Sprint good
[0:57:41] <Targical> Retrospect, it changes flow a lot

[0:57:44] <+TheChapyGuy> @TheHylianGuard I will defend old-school shooters sprint in that you could do it forever, and even just toggle it to auto run. you didn't run out of breath in 7 steps in Doom
[0:57:44] <%yhom_tork> PogChamp
[0:57:46] <%DSD24> @Dynamo_Commando Some people just didn't like sprinting in Halo
[0:57:47] <%RunningNGunning> Its useful again!
[0:57:47] <%Pinkiefan> I didn't love sprint. I would have preferred a faster base movement speed.

[0:59:04] <asurite_warrior> Spartan 1 were prototypes where most of the test subjects dying or being horribly deformed. Spartan 2 were children kidnapped with a better survival rate and were made into super badasses, Spartan 3s had less modifications were war orphans and were specifically made for suicide missions, then spartan 4s are modified normal soldiers.

[0:59:15] <%ScreamLord> Spartan-IIs were kidnapped and given a lot of dangerous enhancements that killed more than not and cybernetics. Spartan-IIIs are orphans from the Covenant War that were given much safer and cheaper Chemical Enhancements that were exactly as potent as IIs. About 30% of candidates will survive Spartan-II augmentations but 100% will survive III Augments
[0:59:15] <+GarboArbo> So good
[0:59:16] <Lieutenant_America> I didn't even know it did that

[1:02:08] <+GarboArbo> Sprint is fine
[1:02:12] <Raztron> Changes Map size and time to kill other players
[1:02:14] <armchairmaster_> Sprint is fine chat, but AUTO LOCK on in 5 is bad

[1:02:50] <dinnydanny777> @derap41 They're American led I think so I just assume they've committed them tbh
[1:02:52] <%NovaKnightmare> the Reach Pistol is nearly CE levels of good
[1:02:52] <%BurdRightsActivist> Woolie plays like an e3 presentation
[1:02:57] <Dynamo_Commando> How long till woolie sends a grunt child soldier to space?
[1:02:58] <thebestestkevin> I find that everyone who makes fun of antisprint halo fans dont have any arguments beyond "i like it" or "other games have it too"
[1:02:59] <marvel877> predates halo 1 but running around with armor abilities. handwaved in universe as they were prototypes or something like that lost in Reach.
[1:03:00] <+mechslayer71> Turn on classic aim control, it’s better @woolieversus
[1:03:01] <thetrashman_sc> armor lock is a meme tier
[1:03:01] <wintrysoma> plasma pistoling the falcon to skip half the level is based tech
[1:03:03] <Targical> Oh yea, bloom
[1:03:04] <%Goraka91> Skirmishers PogChamp
[1:03:08] <+JeluxDaCasual> Nobody cares about canon when playing video games
[1:03:12] <+D00msDayDan> t'voans in the house
[1:03:18] <ZeroCruz> Nah it’s still useless
[1:03:18] <%MacabreOpus> Banshees, fast and low!

[1:03:33] <thetrashman_sc> anyway reach was the last good halo game
[1:03:34] <%alpacasintophats> we shall never turn off the grunt birthday now shall we
[1:03:37] <Minerslovegames> assault rifle can shred shields up close.
[1:03:41] <+JeluxDaCasual> Cannonically, ODST's shouldn't be able to run around with turrets of flip vehicles then
[1:03:42] <+Dnarbredlih> Shroud is at like 320k viewers right now lmfao
[1:03:45] <Raztron> multiplayer reach is mid yea
[1:03:48] <+thfiddles> skirmishers are fun sad they went extinct lmao
[1:03:50] <Raztron> Single player is good
[1:03:53] <+notkojima> only good halo is infinite, only nerds disagree
[1:04:01] <+Walopoh> Also Arby
[1:04:03] <@Menitta> no dual wield woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:04:05] <dinnydanny777> Night vision is so cool
[1:04:05] <Crippl3> shoutouts to john halo
[1:04:06] <Invertin> "unfortunately" he says about the thing that saved the gun balance
[1:04:06] <ghoulishcripple> Craig is best Halo addition
[1:04:08] <Louie_Salmon> They're not cool enough
[1:04:09] <$whiskeybuisness> mjolnir 6 the only dual-wield tech
[1:04:10] <+Zyquux> UNSC: "Our pistols are too strong, let's make them weaker."
[1:04:15] <sunnythedrunk> to be fair dual wield seems like a bad idea in war
[1:04:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Johnny 2 Guns
[1:04:18] <%vaderxyz1970> Elites Dual Wield though the cheaters
[1:04:19] <StebTheVee> what difficulty are they playing?
[1:04:20] <%brave_sj> Only John Halo is cool enough to dual wield
[1:04:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Craig breebuPog
[1:04:24] <%Goraka91> @thfiddles Didn't they just lost so many during Reach they stopped being part of Covenant forces
[1:04:26] <pochecito> They speak wort wort wort
[1:04:26] <+Juriasu> SourPls
[1:04:28] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Wort wort wort
[1:04:29] <GoogleyGareth> Yeah you haven't got an ai in your head to translate
[1:04:32] <thetrashman_sc> they made the covvies scarier
[1:04:32] <+Freeborg1997> Awwww
[1:04:35] <+Billyfig1> 1 gun for John Halo, 1 gun for Cortana Halo
[1:04:38] <%Tadashi047> cortana translates
[1:04:38] <dinnydanny777> This is early into the war too
[1:04:39] <+Walopoh> No AI translation
[1:04:44] <+QueequegTheater> You don't have Cortana
[1:04:45] <DigitalJoshie> yea
[1:04:45] <%condemned_15> Devs want to make them intimidating again
[1:04:45] <+duskrush> I think Cortana translates for Chief
[1:04:46] <dinnydanny777> Maybe they haven't learnt English/Latin yet
[1:04:46] <%derap41> No Cortana to translate
[1:04:46] <+notkojima> Craig is more over than anyone on Raw, put the strap on him brother
[1:04:47] <odd_slater> SourPls
[1:04:48] <+Krecart> They don't have Cortana to translate
[1:04:48] <thetrashman_sc> SourPls
[1:04:49] <ashenjuan25> Gruntpocalypse
[1:04:51] <Raztron> Yup decades
[1:04:55] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:04:56] <%doomerskeletor13> @dinnydanny777 No it’s not, this is the same year as Halo CE
[1:05:00] <%RioGascar> in game design: they created a langauge for the covenent and bungie REALLY WAS PROUD so they used it a ton
[1:05:02] <+QueequegTheater> GET TACTICAL
[1:05:06] <%raven_frame> Forgoing sprint, nice.
[1:05:07] <armchairmaster_> Oh my god woolie went the EXACT wrong way
[1:05:10] <Raztron> Reach is the last big planet they have besides Earth
[1:05:13] <%derap41> Pop em child skulls
[1:05:13] <+sadiebubs> Halo is pretty cool
[1:05:14] <dinnydanny777> @doomerskeletor13 I thought this happened before Combat Evolved
[1:05:15] <iamtheTwitchghost> grunt birthday party is a mood
[1:05:16] <armchairmaster_> He back on travk
[1:05:18] <Sp3ctre48> The Skirmishers almost got extincted by this battle apparently
[1:05:19] <%Goraka91> @thfiddles Also they live in the asteroids of their home system and consider themselves superior to regular Jackals, which they are LUL
[1:05:21] <Torivore> Covies spoke english 20 years earlier in Wars
[1:05:22] <%threeheadedwalrus> what is this runescape music
[1:05:25] <+JeluxDaCasual> @doomerskeletor13 literally the same WEEK as Halo 1
[1:05:28] <%doomerskeletor13> @iamthetwitchghost Like a month before it
[1:05:32] <%brachydios777> This is months before CE
[1:05:37] <%RioGascar> the tuning fork as bungie calls them
[1:05:38] <%DesertPenguin> Sniper pistol? Really?
[1:05:39] <MegaQuint> SPEEN
[1:05:41] <zamzoph> Why are the old dropships shaped like tuning forks?
[1:05:43] <%KorieTheCoward> KorieTheCoward converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[1:05:43] <NekoZen> Dont forget ASSASSINATIONS
[1:05:44] <+thfiddles> @goraka91 it’s the hair
[1:05:46] <wahilliham> the covenent have a warrior lanugaue that the best armies only speak
[1:05:47] <%brachydios777> Speen
[1:05:48] <iamtheTwitchghost> @doomerskeletor13 i think you're replaying to the wrong person?
[1:05:48] <+smikeye> shield recharge is so slow
[1:05:50] <DigitalJoshie> man those grunts get yeeted hard
[1:05:52] <+Pequod1> @DesertPenguin you didn't watch CE huh

[1:06:03] <%Valask> the word "covies" hits ny ears in a very wrong way
[1:06:07] <+GarboArbo> lol
[1:06:08] <AThing_> @Menitta Nah just weird arm
[1:06:09] <+Strelok608> the end of reach lines up immediately with the start of halo 1
[1:06:12] <%FallenAngelZelos> Wheeeeeeeee!
[1:06:13] <Raztron> its a serious invasion with the best Covenant warriors, So No English
[1:06:15] <Talinu> Isn't this a week before CE?
[1:06:17] <@Menitta> Oh right
[1:06:17] <%seniormeatbox> the DAMN convenant
[1:06:22] <%Goraka91> @thfiddles Meanwhile you have them lizard ones in 4 and 5 that're from another continent on the homeworld, I find it neat how the aliens have subspecies
[1:06:24] <%brachydios777> @talinu Months
[1:06:24] <Ynkubus_> knee stuck lol
[1:06:27] <dinnydanny777> Why is Woolie's characters knee like that
[1:06:30] <wintrysoma> that DAMN chaos emerald
[1:06:30] <+D00msDayDan> the scope of this game alone is like a month or two
[1:06:32] <Minerslovegames> Spartan III tech was cheaper and not as advanced.
[1:06:33] <Second_Omega> Doesn't this whole game happen over a month
[1:06:36] <armchairmaster_> Uuuuhhh, whats that? His knee?
[1:06:38] <thebestestkevin> its like a month before CE
[1:06:39] <librettodude> @Valask absolutely intentional I would wager, considering the IMC vibes of the whole series
[1:06:40] <dinnydanny777> Has this Spartan dislocated his knee?
[1:06:41] <Raztron> @Second_Omega Yes
[1:06:41] <+JeluxDaCasual> @Talinu same week, yes. Reach ends where 1 starts
[1:06:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1293070990046572547?s=19

[1:07:00] <+Pequod1> Thats his bicep
[1:07:02] <%CEGold> CEGold subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months!
[1:07:03] <JayPastaForce> Vadamee's boi's
[1:07:04] <garbageheaphound> Elites are a real fuckin threat in this game
[1:07:05] <%brachydios777> Nice
[1:07:08] <%The_Swedish_X> red reticule is effective range, not max range.
[1:07:14] <Sp3ctre48> Elites are very scary in Reach yeah
[1:07:15] <Lieutenant_America> The FOV slider and the Pistol arms don't quite agree with each other
[1:07:23] <$whiskeybuisness> storm rifles!
[1:07:29] <WG101> schmoovin
[1:07:30] <@Menitta> aw yeah plasma repeater
[1:07:30] <Minerslovegames> The Elites mean BUSINESS in Reach.
[1:07:31] <+D00msDayDan> it's really fucked up that the first time you see elites there's like two ultras
[1:07:31] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[1:07:32] <+Pequod1> splat
[1:07:32] <dinnydanny777> You can hit enemies that are really far away with the Assault Rifle if you fire slowly
[1:07:32] <Raztron> Master Chief is awake and running around for this first level
[1:07:33] <Solidnick18> oh
[1:07:33] <%wunp_fxs> wow
[1:07:33] <+duskrush> Elite's are serious AF in Reach
[1:07:34] <+GarboArbo> ROCKED
[1:07:34] <%RyTYoung> oof
[1:07:34] <idiotscampaign> this is one of the roughest intros to an enemy in Halo history
[1:07:36] <DigitalJoshie> LUL
[1:07:36] <%NovaKnightmare> these are the toughest Elites in the games
[1:07:36] <%RioGascar> woolie about to see how hardcore elites are
[1:07:37] <TheHylianGuard> been a while since you've had to fight elites
[1:07:40] <%huskarl_zap> REKTED
[1:07:42] <odd_slater> smoovin
[1:07:42] <%mikessdd> WOW okay so yeah it is about a month but the game communicates this very poorly
[1:07:42] <+QueequegTheater> Reach Elites best Elites
[1:07:44] <Crippl3> elites are schmovin
[1:07:44] <+PunishedCoviello> Halo Reach-Around.
[1:07:45] <%huskarl_zap> CHAD ELITES
[1:07:45] <%brachydios777> Wort Wort Wort
[1:07:45] <%The_Swedish_X> elites are aggressive as shit in this game
[1:07:45] <%RioGascar> elites this time DO NOT FUCK AROUND
[1:07:46] <%raven_frame> He got both of you?
[1:07:46] <BritishTyrannosaur> keep forgetting arbiter is like behind the scenes doing big honours with pew pew beams
[1:07:47] <Lieutenant_America> Is it weird that I honestly prefer H3 Brutes to the Elites in general?
[1:07:47] <pochecito> YEA FAST
[1:07:48] <+GarboArbo> Elites move
[1:07:48] <vincerocmm> the super elites
[1:07:50] <%Goraka91> Imagine fighting Elites as a regular marine
[1:07:50] <+ntfth> Vadamee's bois know what they're doing.
[1:07:51] <%biggdaddymike> The Elites are no joke here
[1:07:52] <%ScreamLord> @whiskeybuisness Nah, Plasma Repeaters. WAY better than Storms
[1:07:53] <idiotscampaign> the Reach Elites will push your shit back in
[1:07:55] <+Walopoh> You also ain't John Halo no more
[1:07:56] <%seniormeatbox> Moa burgers
[1:07:56] <%mikessdd> In game it seems like a week goes by at most
[1:07:57] <Explodincatz> Heroic means heroic
[1:07:58] <Nomad94> Reach Elites on Legendary are a FORCE
[1:08:00] <Lieutenant_America> Also wow they're already throwing Ultras
[1:08:04] <Dynamo_Commando> "Wheee! Hey I didn't know Trandoshans could fly?!"
[1:08:05] <Raztron> Arbiter is literrally worse than Hitler in this game
[1:08:08] <wintrysoma> elites are better as allies, I love that team-up-with-the-enemy shit
[1:08:09] <+duskrush> WOOF
[1:08:09] <jaygee303> Reach us way harder
[1:08:10] <dinnydanny777> If you have an automatic weapon and fire it slowly you can hit enemies that are much farther away
[1:08:10] <Raztron> Billions
[1:08:11] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> Also just best elites in halo
[1:08:11] <%CalderGaming> Thel'Vadamee's boys are coming for you
[1:08:12] <%yhom_tork> BOP
[1:08:14] <+GarboArbo> Plasma repeater is so trash
[1:08:16] <Idon__> YAAAAAY
[1:08:17] <SirDogBear> that emu was dodging everything PogChamp
[1:08:17] <%threeheadedwalrus> you need to get headshots in this game
[1:08:20] <$whiskeybuisness> @ScreamLord i forgot what they were called in this
[1:08:22] <Second_Omega> Vadamee's Bois
[1:08:23] <Torivore> Not your grandpa's elites
[1:08:26] <BritishTyrannosaur> Chad vadamee
[1:08:27] <+QueequegTheater> So yeah, Reach is tough
[1:08:28] <%RunningNGunning> Elites are bastards in this game
[1:08:30] <@Menitta> but its cool
[1:08:38] <%huskarl_zap> STAND infront of them and take an axe kick
[1:08:41] <sunnythedrunk> Reach is one of the harder Halo games
[1:08:41] <odd_slater> AEAB
[1:08:44] <dinnydanny777> The soldiers in the first game are super badasses when you think about it
[1:08:46] <+Walopoh> Cover is super important this game
[1:08:48] <+duskrush> You're no John Halo
[1:09:00] <Nomad94> Legendary Solo took me a good while in this
[1:09:00] <+duskrush> You'
[1:09:01] <+mechslayer71> So has woolie lost all gameplay skill since like a week ago?
[1:09:03] <BritishTyrannosaur> Johanthan halo
[1:09:04] <Raztron> Yea really good demonstrations they're supposed to be as strong as Spartan-2s
[1:09:05] <%yhom_tork> JOSEPH HALO
[1:09:05] <+GarboArbo> You are Noble Six
[1:09:06] <+duskrush> You're Stan Reach
[1:09:07] <%RioGascar> and on laso...boy these elites
[1:09:09] <Lieutenant_America> You're no John Kennedy
[1:09:11] <+RioGascar> scary
[1:09:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Looks so good Kreygasm
[1:09:14] <%doomerskeletor13> You are now Woolie Halo
[1:09:15] <Second_Omega> Only other spartan with the title of "Hyper Lethal Vector"
[1:09:18] <+duskrush> Giorno Reach
[1:09:20] <%The_Swedish_X> Legendary Reach involved a lot of laming it the fuck out.
[1:09:21] <+QueequegTheater> @Raztron No they aren't. They're mass-produced
[1:09:26] <%RioGascar> elites in reach LASO do not fuck around and you fear them
[1:09:27] <%johnny_gogo> thats my favorite part of halo spin off games your not john so it tends to be harder
[1:09:31] <%ScreamLord> NEW GUN
[1:09:38] <OverlordLuna> Kreygasm
[1:09:43] <Nomad94> Noble 6 is as deadly as John Halo, though
[1:09:46] <%Estuko> Stupid sexy elites...
[1:09:47] <weirdmothgirl> I love that the birds are just... there. Fuckin around
[1:09:48] <%shadowsofpain> John Halo is not afraid of nothing
[1:09:48] <Raztron> @QueequegTheater Elites are
[1:09:50] <%derap41> Big plasma gun
[1:09:51] <%raven_frame> Jorge is always playing in third person.
[1:09:56] <%GrumbleGrouse> needle rifle is bae
[1:09:56] <wintrysoma> people love to talk about odst being harder because you're not a spartan but i barely notice the difference
[1:09:56] <dinnydanny777> I love that gun
[1:10:00] <dinnydanny777> That gun is sick
[1:10:10] <dinnydanny777> Reach has good guns
[1:10:13] <AThing_> I forgot about this rad ass gun
[1:10:15] <sunnythedrunk> Well John Halo is like Superman the nobles are like Justice League member
[1:10:17] <prime_name> Love it
[1:10:19] <Lieutenant_America> I could never aim with the Repeater
[1:10:22] <%KoyFoster> I never knew that.
[1:10:27] <+Vikingdeath1> I remember liking this gun
[1:10:28] <+D00msDayDan> cool gun, fucking garbage though
[1:10:28] <marisot_lemonade> woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:10:32] <+GarboArbo> It's not good imo
[1:10:37] <%derap41> you can burst and still hit stuff tho
[1:10:44] <+QueequegTheater> TRUCKS
[1:10:44] <%Estuko> @wintrysoma Same, I love the risk/danger of being an ODST instead of a Spartan. It's very cool to see the size difference to
[1:10:45] <+Walopoh> Is it ever explained how Six knows how to handle Covenant weapons like Chief can?
[1:10:46] <%ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus The Repeater never overheats. Instead it becomes slower but more accurate until you vent it
[1:10:46] <+Solid_Stro> Not good for multiplayer
[1:10:49] <%raven_frame> I'm still looking forward to when Woolie gets that weapon.
[1:10:49] <dinnydanny777> If you fire the automatic weapons in slow bursts they'll be more accurate
[1:10:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> @queequegtheater Yeah, these are cheaper and rely more on numbers and teamwork, instead of being the nost expensive elite prototypes that can go one-man-army.
[1:10:54] <Nomad94> these are just regular ol jeeps
[1:11:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL

[1:12:33] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> 3 shots in the same spot will make a splodey
[1:12:34] <%derap41> It almost makes up for the dual needlers
[1:12:36] <dinnydanny777> You can rapid fire it
[1:12:37] <Minerslovegames> Four needles on unshielded enemies for the explosion.

[1:12:57] <andre11dr> It's cool, but carbine is way better
[1:12:57] <%ScreamLord> Reach weapons need to make a comback in Infinite
[1:12:57] <Targical> Only 3 required
[1:12:58] <MrHappyFunshine> Needle rifle is an auto weapon which is quite nice
[1:12:58] <WG101> nice

[1:13:58] <$Rumbutt> Nah, that was Sniper Boy
[1:13:59] <+Pequod1> that was Jun actually
[1:13:59] <thebestestkevin> no its Jun lol
[1:13:59] <dinnydanny777> The covenant sure did develop different guns in the short time between Reach and Combat Evolved
[1:13:59] <SeedTabulous> !MOTIVATED

[1:14:02] <+duskrush> Emile don't care if he can't stab it
[1:14:02] <+QueequegTheater> WRONG
[1:14:03] <+eiightbiitt> no that be Jun
[1:14:03] <+thfiddles> it’s weird that that specific line is so flat
[1:14:05] <+QueequegTheater> THAT WAS JUN
[1:14:06] <Second_Omega> Wrong XD
[1:14:07] <+Zyquux> wasn't that Jun?
[1:14:08] <%AlexandriasFolly> Actually that was Jun not Emile
[1:14:09] <pizza_oven3000> that was jun
[1:14:09] <%The_Swedish_X> jun and Emile are both asses
[1:14:10] <+mechslayer71> IT WAS EMILE @woolieversus
[1:14:11] <Darkened_SNIP3R> that was jun
[1:14:12] <+GarboArbo> CRAZY RIGHT?
[1:14:12] <%ScreamLord> Plasma Repeater is my favorite Covenant weapon and I wish we got that instead of the Storm Rifle
[1:14:13] <%God_Of_Oreos> actually that's a spiker Kappa
[1:14:14] <Second_Omega> Jun is about the job
[1:14:16] <alrobot2014> yeah its better than the audio quality at launch
[1:14:18] <Nomad94> who was it?!
[1:14:19] <+mechslayer71> JUN*
[1:14:20] <+eiightbiitt> V calls us out on BS
[1:14:22] <%RioGascar> bungie spent a lot of time ON PRESENTATION
[1:14:24] <BritishTyrannosaur> listening to 2007 xbox live chat
[1:14:27] <+GarboArbo> Blew my mind
[1:14:33] <%MacabreOpus> I mean if you listen to actual marine forces or military troops converse over radio it's always very monotonous
[1:14:34] <+mechslayer71> It was Jun, the sniper guy
[1:14:35] <Nomad94> I hoenstly love Reacj
[1:14:42] <Nomad94> Reach
[1:14:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Reading the wiki, it seems that Reach was less like 1000 9/11s and more like a million Pearl Harbors
[1:14:47] <%Bigyanno> I think this game would benefit from having sprint not be the default ability
[1:14:47] <$whiskeybuisness> @Nomad94 the rando dude on the radio doing the distress call is the secret tunnel nomad
[1:14:50] <CrypticMochi> Not sure if I’m remembering right, but did explosives suck ass in this one?
[1:14:55] <Second_Omega> For a guy that constantly calls us out on things, boy howdy does V pull a pat
[1:14:57] <%alpacasintophats> Reach is still my favorite Halo to dat
[1:15:01] <%alpacasintophats> date*
[1:15:01] <+duskrush> weird, the marines are in a different place from where they were in my game
[1:15:01] <Minerslovegames> Calm under pressure is how most radio operators go.
[1:15:02] <+mechslayer71> I wonder what problem V has with this game
[1:15:16] <%The_Swedish_X> drop ships are bastards in this game
[1:15:19] <Clear_Truth> it's depressing
[1:15:20] <+eiightbiitt> Yup a full on Orb Goblin Pat
[1:15:22] <%mikessdd> oh does V not like this one?
[1:15:30] <Louie_Salmon> Wait why would woolie be pressing RB at that moment
[1:15:32] <@Menitta> man, watching Woolie stream without academic pressure just isnt the same
[1:15:33] <Lieutenant_America> Also it's splitting hairs, but most of the allied NPCs in this game are Army, not Marine
[1:15:33] <Minerslovegames> Probably the ability system @mechslayer71, it's not my favorite either.
[1:15:35] <+GarboArbo> DMR

[1:16:44] <herzogtheanimal> BR is overrated
[1:16:46] <+GarboArbo> Needle rifle is too good
[1:16:48] <%Bigyanno> Needle Rifle is a broken weapon
[1:16:49] <ZeroCruz> Assault rifle LUL
[1:16:51] <$whiskeybuisness> NR is pretty great
[1:16:57] <%DSD24> I like the Grunt designs in this game
[1:16:57] <+thfiddles> the dmr is fine but i feel like it’s just not as fun? it would be nice to have more options for that type of gun
[1:17:01] <%superc37> ur mum is overrated
[1:17:02] <bearwagon> nice
[1:17:10] <%mikessdd> Of course playing halo4&5 and just carrying both because fuck it
[1:17:11] <JetpackMcQuack> What a warzone
[1:17:11] <%Gelphaze> YEA YEA GET IM.
[1:17:12] <Pizza_Mezza> Woolie does not aim for the head. Like, ever.
[1:17:14] <%Bigyanno> The only issue with the Needle Rifle is that it's complete garbage against shields
[1:17:18] <%superc37> fuckin got him
[1:17:21] <Solidnick18> yeeee
[1:17:21] <%MacabreOpus> Something about the single shots isn't as satisfying as the short bursts
[1:17:23] <+Pequod1> THe DMR is so good it makes all the other guns in the game less viable
[1:17:24] <@Menitta> it also looks so fucking cool
[1:17:24] <$GiantPapaDoug> dmr is near power weapon levels in reach
[1:17:25] <Lieutenant_America> The issue with DMR is that it kinda invalidates many other weapon choices even more than the BR did
[1:17:29] <$GiantPapaDoug> same as halo 2 br
[1:17:37] <$GiantPapaDoug> real game changer when your team has one
[1:17:37] <%ScreamLord> NO IT'S NOT!
[1:17:40] <+Kqha4000> Its fully automatic
[1:17:40] <%Bigyanno> X=3
[1:17:41] <%johnny_gogo> this song is a bop
[1:17:42] <dinnydanny777> It's also cool looking
[1:17:42] <+GarboArbo> Hold trigger
[1:17:44] <+miakhalifaisoverrated> boy that delay is pretty bad isn't it
[1:17:44] <%brave_sj> Should be 3
[1:17:45] <wubi_desu> the dmr fucks
[1:17:47] <herzogtheanimal> Bursts waste ammo tho. I must horde ammo because the goblins told me.
[1:17:48] <idiotscampaign> 3 i think?
[1:17:52] <$whiskeybuisness> they did BR dirty in Halo 4+, and loved the DMR too much
[1:17:54] <%brachydios777> It can be full auto
[1:18:03] <dinnydanny777> You can spam the trigger on it
[1:18:06] <%ScreamLord> Needle Rifle > DMR > BR
[1:18:06] <+mr_pl0w> hold trigger for auto
[1:18:13] <%DSD24> What kind of grunts?

[1:18:25] <$GiantPapaDoug> they did patch meedle rifle to shoot faster as well
[1:18:25] <%Aheg0d> Recoil was worse at launch then it is now
[1:18:25] <%RioGascar> halo reach was VERY boots on the ground presentation feel

[1:31:49] <alrobot2014> they aren't hot so they're just morally dark
[1:31:52] <+Posh_Cat> Auntie Dot! ellaLOVE
[1:31:53] <R3c0n31> To be fair you cant check morality of Spartans if all spartans are KIA/MIA with exception of 1 true good boi
[1:31:53] <ManlyMcBeefington> ONI is a IRL organization
[1:31:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Space CIA, just as terrible as the real CIA
[1:31:55] <odd_slater> @DSD24 Yeah Bungie did it too lol
[1:31:57] <Lieutenant_America> ONI is like if Cerberus ruled humanity
[1:31:58] <Darkened_SNIP3R> anyone else just see that grunt
[1:31:59] <+IntrepidEye> III's weren't weaker than II's just don't have the years of experience and normally don't get Mjolnir
[1:32:01] <dinnydanny777> The CIA just a TAD Morally Grey, all that gratuitous torture was just a BIT amoral
[1:32:04] <ThatGuyThere03> what
[1:32:05] <andresisant> A lot
[1:32:06] <%DSD24> @DatAsuna Right! I remember now
[1:32:07] <%wunp_fxs> at war with them for 25 plus years
[1:32:08] <$whiskeybuisness> UNSC is DoD (space army, space navy, space marines)
[1:32:09] <Onatamana> @Lieutenant_America Maybe we'll get hints of it in Infinite if the theories about the pilot being an insurrectionist are true.
[1:32:10] <MrHappyFunshine> ONI are more Lawful Evil
[1:32:13] <Torivore> Thousand?
[1:32:13] <%RioGascar> we are only a month before halo ce
[1:32:14] <Raztron> its the war crimes, corruption, and political assasinations and destabilizations
[1:32:15] <andresisant> This is pre Halo one
[1:32:19] <Sullry> ONI dudes glow in the dark lmao
[1:32:19] <Joestar1890> Reach is Earth 2
[1:32:20] <%Goraka91> Reach is Earth's ''Sister world''
[1:32:21] <%Bigyanno> Halo Reach is like a week before Halo 1
[1:32:21] <%Halospaz117> It's basically Earth 2
[1:32:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Like 25 years or something
[1:32:25] <+Kqha4000> All of the spartans are raised and trained on Reach
[1:32:27] <rosemon5001> lol was that a yay for a headshot
[1:32:27] <+GarboArbo> Arby is murdering us good rn
[1:32:29] <Jmann1892> Reach is the Backbone of the UNSC Navy
[1:32:29] <%vaderxyz1970> Reach is Military world
[1:32:31] <Shardlab> Reach is the Arbiter's greatest work
[1:32:31] <%mikessdd> yeah first contact was 2525
[1:32:32] <%AlexandriasFolly> ONI is Morally Grey as in actually evil. But then the Covenant exist so you don't have to think about that.
[1:32:32] <Sp3ctre48> Reach is pretty much the UNSC's military capital
[1:32:34] <+QueequegTheater> Reach is basically Earth 2
[1:32:35] <%huskarl_zap> FOOT
[1:32:35] <andresisant> Yeah earth 2

[1:32:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dinnydanny777 don't forget the coups and overturning foreign democracies for American political gain
[1:32:47] <rosemon5001> ahh @Nomad94
[1:32:47] <@Menitta> Sprint is the best mechanic
[1:32:47] <%ScreamLord> Too use Mass Effect analogies. The UNSC is the Alliance and ONI is Cerberus
[1:32:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> What book or media covers humanity's first encounter with the Covenant?
[1:32:47] <%Estuko> DAS BOOT
[1:32:48] <Minerslovegames> ONI is essentially the CIA taken to its logical conclusion in the worst ways possible. To say they're morally gray is like saying Griffith went A LITTLE overboard during the Eclipse.
[1:32:48] <%DesertPenguin> Apparently

[1:33:25] <%The_Swedish_X> It is better in the hands of an AI than the player
[1:33:28] <MrHappyFunshine> Sprint is fine but i would prefer an overall faster speed
[1:33:29] <DintheAbary> wasn't sprinting also in Halo 5?
[1:33:30] <%The_Timo> combat music lol so good
[1:33:31] <+Neoepochx> Why do I want my fucking gun to be down when I'm moving at top speed?

[1:33:41] <%Estuko> @duskrush much better comparison vs Runescape music LUL
[1:33:42] <+thfiddles> what’s that reddit post with just every shot of master chief sprinting in cutscenes
[1:33:43] <%ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Remember, Military Intelligence
[1:33:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> @FallenAngelZelos they run dot exes to grind for that sweet sweet cash money, freaking nerds
[1:33:43] <Crippl3> @DintheAbary yes, this was the first one with sprint
[1:33:45] <+TheotherKristian> Infinite can just do what Gears does and stretch the spawn points to account for the speed in which players can move
[1:33:46] <%mikessdd> sprint is in 4 and 5 by default not as a pickup
[1:33:46] <%Bigyanno> Sprint slept with my wife
[1:33:48] <+GarboArbo> This song man
[1:33:50] <Nomad94> @Neoepochx you might be running the fuck away
[1:33:54] <Joestar1890> @DintheAbary Halo 5 had alot of movement options
[1:33:54] <%The_Swedish_X> I find the AI kinda trash in this game, even with a sniper, they barely put in work.
[1:33:56] <%DappercatEsquire> sprint would've been better if it was a naruto run but 343 aren't brave enough
[1:34:01] <DintheAbary> @crippl3 thanks I thought I remembered that right haha
[1:34:02] <diontmack> sprint ate my breakfast
[1:34:04] <%phatmac16> SPRINT KILLED MY FAMILY
[1:34:05] <Afterman_> @armchairmaster_ ye all of the va is super good. I'm just a huge wire fan lol. This is actually tempting me to jump back into the MCC (thanks gamepass) just so I can eventually play through this
[1:34:06] <AppleBerryKitty> out of everything in the game, this is the only part I like, thats it thats all.
[1:34:09] <wragglee> Sprint killed my wife in a drunk driving accident
[1:34:11] <%Aheg0d> Sprint killed my parents, fucked my wife and poisoned my crops
[1:34:11] <armchairmaster_> @theotherkristian but infinite isnt out yet?
[1:34:14] <+Neoepochx> Don't lock it behind an additional mechanic.
[1:34:15] <%phatmac16> SPRINT ATE MY DOG
[1:34:19] <Nomad94> @AppleBerryKitty in addition to all the other great missiosn
[1:34:19] <R3c0n31> IT IS REALLY HARD
[1:34:20] <%superc37> @dappercatesquire the only valid take
[1:34:22] <%wunp_fxs> Legendary is hard as fuck...still not as bad as halo2
[1:34:24] <vincerocmm> reading
[1:34:26] <%huskarl_zap> Its been doing that since 2
[1:34:29] <%Bigyanno> I am CONVINCED that it reads your input on Legendary
[1:34:29] <%huskarl_zap> or three
[1:34:29] <%mikessdd> Infinite will come out sometime in 2021
[1:34:32] <AppleBerryKitty> "great missions"
[1:34:35] <Lieutenant_America> @The_Swedish_X According to Raycevick, Reach had to sacrifice AI capabilites as a tradeoff for having more enemies in fights.
[1:34:36] <%DSD24> Reading inputs is the worst
[1:34:37] <%stayinthepocket> Reach is actually one of the easiest Halos
[1:34:39] <%Javaa01> Halo has always read your inputs in terms of aiming, that's just broken in the MCC version of 1
[1:34:39] <+IntrepidEye> Sprint is fine. They could do without the aim down sights in Infinite though. Just make automatics have more range as standard
[1:34:40] <+thfiddles> i think after 3 the ai got way worse. i always give my dudes the best stuff and even in odst they seemed like they just weren’t trying nearly as hard
[1:34:43] <+BioHunter> halo 2 legendary still the hardest
[1:34:44] <DatAsuna> the checkpoints are real bad
[1:34:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1293070990046572547?s=19
[1:34:45] <%AlexandriasFolly> Reach Legendary is the absolute hardest in the entire series.
[1:34:46] <%roaches_coaches> roaches_coaches subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak!
[1:34:48] <Minerslovegames> There's a reason you get an achievement for beating Reach solo on Legendary.
[1:34:51] <+Neoepochx> If someone says they should "add sprint" to Doom then they should be necked.
[1:34:51] <armchairmaster_> Oh GOD i know what hallway he's talking about
[1:34:56] <$whiskeybuisness> new gun!
[1:34:57] <dinnydanny777> Woolie you just shot your team mate in the back
[1:34:58] <Nomad94> @AlexandriasFolly 2 in coop is worse
[1:34:58] <DatAsuna> halo's not great at checkpoint
[1:34:59] <torres_kun> Reach legendary is easy
[1:35:00] <+OranHexthief> the main reason people hate sprint is because it locks you into canned animations that restrict you from performing the types of maneuvers you could in the previous games while also making distances larger
[1:35:01] <+eiightbiitt> oh yeah the orbital cannon laser!
[1:35:04] <thesoldierofjoy> ooh nice shot Woolie
[1:35:06] <%wunp_fxs> Grab that SHiiiii!
[1:35:08] <+Neoepochx> New Blood games don't have sprint and they are WAY better than Halo 4 and 5.
[1:35:09] <%The_Swedish_X> hammer of dawn
[1:35:09] <Solidnick18> oh boy
[1:35:09] <DomunDomunDomun> Hammer of dawn.
[1:35:10] <%Bigyanno> BOOM LASER
[1:35:10] <DatAsuna> but reach in pariuclar blocks them for some bs sections
[1:35:10] <beefboi18> hey hey people
[1:35:12] <torres_kun> Noob combo is all you need
[1:35:13] <$whiskeybuisness> keep that when it's empty. it recharges
[1:35:14] <Solidnick18> shhhh
[1:35:15] <%brave_sj> Use it on a grunt

[1:35:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HAMMER OF DAWN
[1:35:17] <Ynkubus_> Reach solo legendary is easy, especially when you counter cheat the bs
[1:35:17] <+thfiddles> lmao imagine sprint in doom he’d be so fucking fast it would be uncontrollable
[1:35:18] <dinnydanny777> Don't drop that
[1:35:19] <%DSD24> @Neoepochx Wouldn't that just send you straight into the walls and kill you
[1:35:21] <+mr_pl0w> plasma pistol and dmr or pistol = EZ
[1:35:22] <%MacabreOpus> New spartan laser but Hammer of Dawn
[1:35:23] <+Ragnakawaii> PogChamp
[1:35:24] <Raztron> make it a 3rd person spin off if you want sprint you 343 hacks
[1:35:24] <%DesertPenguin> Hey, look at that
[1:35:25] <dinnydanny777> Do not drop that
[1:35:27] <%raven_frame> Hopefully sprint isn't in the Infinite multiplayer, or that there are modes and maps balanced around there being no sprint.
[1:35:30] <%ScreamLord> Target Painter

[1:36:16] <$whiskeybuisness> undoing armor lock is also an AOE plasma shot
[1:36:16] <dinnydanny777> It's not quite a space laser but it is a space artillery
[1:36:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> Holy shit the orbital strike locks in to targets, YES
[1:36:17] <%God_Of_Oreos> @sniffy77 so they're jackal Belters?
[1:36:33] <$whiskeybuisness> the target locator recharges later
[1:36:33] <%yhom_tork> hammer of dawn
[1:36:36] <karl_rex> It recharges on easier difficulties I think
[1:36:36] <+Neoepochx> Or Quakeguy or Any build engine dude?
[1:36:37] <%DSD24> @Neoepochx I mean in Destiny if you go too fast you die flying into walls , so possibly?

[1:40:22] <%FallenAngelZelos> guy had a bad day
[1:40:23] <%DianaTheAscian> nice
[1:40:24] <%Bigyanno> It's kinda useless on legendary
[1:40:25] <%RunningNGunning> Its aight in campaign, absolutely useless in Multiplayer
[1:40:28] <%The_Swedish_X> I suck with that gun, but I appreciate it.
[1:40:29] <Explodincatz> boom
[1:40:32] <%DSD24> @Goraka91 It was in the Rise of Skywalker and its a meme like because it makes no sense storyline wise
[1:40:34] <sniffy77> even though this is campaign and woolie is only fighting AI enemies, I still have a immediate repulsion to armor lock due to how shitty it makes multiplayer
[1:40:40] <Darren716> Yeah they did
[1:40:41] <APsaull> Armor lock is the parry button to counter melee
[1:40:44] <+Freeborg1997> @Goraka91 If it's a line in a Star Wars movie, it's a meme. It is law on the internet.
[1:40:46] <wragglee> woolie blew it up lmao
[1:40:56] <fault_417> The fucking armor lock meta in the multiplayer
[1:40:57] <%Goraka91> @Freeborg23 This is true

[1:41:08] <%Bigyanno> I like Woolie's outfit
[1:41:10] <R3c0n31> Can you do it in 4 player and go too both at the same time?
[1:41:12] <zamzoph> this music don't seem so great
[1:41:17] <Ynkubus_> armour lock in mp was fine, you can easily counter play it
[1:41:21] <dinnydanny777> I'm so glad we finally got a Halo level where you can just drive around
[1:41:26] <+GarboArbo> Armor lock is cool but annoying when people just use it to prolong fights
[1:41:26] <+mechslayer71> @sniffy77 Armor lock doesn’t really matter in MP is you know how to deal with it. It no longer regents shields, nor does it throw off stickies if you’re already stuck
[1:41:30] <%The_Swedish_X> Also, the turret as a cooldown now
[1:41:32] <%ScreamLord> Mounted Turrets overheat now
[1:41:40] <%Bigyanno> Yeah i always go east first too
[1:41:40] <%DSD24> I like how Woolie went opposite of I went
[1:41:42] <%MacabreOpus> They overheat now?!
[1:41:48] <fault_417> Oh yeah no you can beat armor lock users it just drags out the encounter

[1:42:49] <fault_417> Bungie can never settle on what the covenant warthog should be for more than one game
[1:42:50] <+DrTomT18> so they arent getting data pads
[1:42:52] <%condemned_15> why

[1:42:58] <%mikessdd> it does V liar
[1:43:01] <%The_Swedish_X> shield was coming back actually
[1:43:01] <$whiskeybuisness> @GarboArbo it's a ghost that the flag man can ride in!
[1:43:02] <nobody12349> It does
[1:43:02] <%jorniev> dude this game looks GREAT STILL
[1:43:05] <R3c0n31> I legit forgot that normal plasma rifle is in the game
[1:43:07] <Louie_Salmon> They do
[1:43:07] <%Bail_seven> it does in campaign
[1:43:09] <%DSD24> No reload woolie
[1:43:12] <dinnydanny777> This music is great
[1:43:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie vs Ammo indeed
[1:43:12] <%Javaa01> Armor Lock being cheap? Why I never
[1:43:13] <%vaderxyz1970> Bubble Sheild better
[1:43:17] <%DSD24> Oh it was out actually my bad
[1:43:20] <%ScreamLord> It does, but the start up takes loner than your Armor Lock lasts
[1:43:22] <Lieutenant_America> It's more for stopping an imminent kill hit like a tank round, or EMP-ing the enemies around you
[1:43:25] <%afronooch> honestly games could stay at this level of graphics and id be cool
[1:43:25] <KnivesEve> how does woolie not look at ammo at this point
[1:43:29] <+GarboArbo> I wish we got more of the Spectre lol
[1:43:34] <+Freeborg1997> Woolie likes those classic human guns
[1:43:38] <%Bigyanno> There are DMR's in the other building IIRC
[1:43:39] <stardustcrusad3r> can you dual wield in this game
[1:43:47] <%ChoculaUltra> negative
[1:43:47] <%Halospaz117> No dual wield this time
[1:43:48] <%huskarl_zap> no
[1:43:51] <fault_417> No. Only npc elites can
[1:43:51] <dinnydanny777> This music is really interesting
[1:43:56] <%DSD24> Sniper Sniper combo
[1:43:56] <Onatamana> snipper riffle
[1:43:56] <%Goraka91> Yeah this music is strange
[1:43:58] <%Halospaz117> Man I love the needle rifle
[1:43:58] <%mikessdd> Can't you bust vehicles with armor lock? Like if they ram you full speed?
[1:44:02] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> 2 precision weapons? weird choice but okay.
[1:44:03] <%alpacasintophats> that sniper is SO much more devastating in this game
[1:44:07] <%AlexandriasFolly> Sniper now destroys vehicles.
[1:44:10] <Lieutenant_America> Echo like the MGS1 menu
[1:44:13] <heartlesshealer> I'm sorry, did I hear "needle rifle"? How fast to they fly in Reach? (I never played or saw footage of this one)
[1:44:17] <%alpacasintophats> it's now a viable anti vehicle weapon
[1:44:20] <thesoldierofjoy> And vehicles.
[1:44:21] <%yhom_tork> LuL
[1:44:22] <%ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Fun thing to do. Bait a vehicle into charging you and then Armorlock just before you get his. The vehicle will either spin out of control or explode on impact
[1:44:23] <%derap41> love the active scope on the sniper rifle

[1:44:44] <idiotscampaign> Woolie, use it all on grunts please
[1:44:44] <%Bigyanno> I only use sniper rifles on grunts on that one level in Halo 1 where there's literally hundreds of sniper rounds dotted around the level
[1:44:47] <%Halospaz117> Needle rifle actually only needs 3 unshielded shots to explode
[1:44:51] <+QueequegTheater> God I fucking love Skirmishers

[1:44:56] <dinnydanny777> The only acceptable use of the Sniper on a grunt is the melee
[1:45:03] <%huskarl_zap> tbh if your anti material rifle needs more than one shot to kill something it should be retired.

[2:02:04] <+cursedwithadhd> oh man I now remember what these terminals were talking about in the end and man it is it cool
[2:02:07] <alrobot2014> well did the turians shoot first

[2:02:15] <%Bigyanno> When Humans came across the first aliens the Turians INVADED THE COLONY
[2:02:16] <Darren716> Honestly worked out pretty well in ME all things considered
[2:02:19] <%RioGascar> woolie you expect too much of people
[2:02:22] <rytisone> guns go brrrr
[2:02:28] <%Goraka91> Yes. The Citadel IS waiting for you monkaS
[2:02:34] <karl_rex> Turians shot first
[2:02:34] <Lieutenant_America> Bruh the Turians attacked humanity without starting communications
[2:02:36] <Darren716> We became a consul species in about 50 years because of the Turian war
[2:02:36] <+GarboArbo> I love how humanity is portrayed in ME
[2:02:36] <Pappajimbo> and babylon 5
[2:02:40] <stormhawk9891> Didn't the Turians shoot first?
[2:02:44] <Second_Omega> Turians were the problem children
[2:02:46] <%Bigyanno> The Turians were VERY HOSTILE
[2:02:47] <dinnydanny777> It's slower
[2:02:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @woolieversus That datapad was written by AIs
[2:02:53] <$emptyantics> Turians are the worst
[2:02:53] <+ntfth> Yes. Turians started the fight.
[2:02:54] <dinnydanny777> The Plasma Rifle is slower in this game
[2:02:57] <%The_Swedish_X> there is no reason to use the rifle
[2:03:00] <%brave_sj> If you meet them and they're cool you just don't go to war, but if you meet them and they're Independence Day tier you need a plan
[2:03:02] <Huntercd> Sexy blue women Turian women and Qurians
[2:03:04] <+D00msDayDan> plasma rifle fucks in this game, repeater is trash
[2:03:05] <%Bigyanno> Turians are space Americans
[2:03:08] <R3c0n31> Here we go
[2:03:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1293070990046572547?s=19
[2:03:10] <SereneFox> You meet aliens for first time, you have 2 choices: You either A try to kill all those aliens or B you try to fuck all those aliens. there is no inbetween.
[2:03:11] <%yhom_tork> YYEYEYEYE
[2:03:11] <%Goraka91> Turians were assholes who resorted to glassing immediately because their feelings were offended
[2:03:14] <+boneso1dier> Turians started it because humanity colonized off limit planets
[2:03:15] <SourTortuga> Humans: oh shit Turians: oh SHIT
[2:03:18] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus They hadn't learned how to hold 2 guns yet
[2:03:19] <alrobot2014> @stormhawk9891 the turains invaded Shanxi immediately i think
[2:03:20] <ghoulishcripple> Turian Human relations are the strongest shown of any 2 species. outside of the asari who dont count they magically are sexy
[2:03:21] <%Gruhunchously> The Turians had their reasons though. The last time someone messed with a relay resulted in the Rachni invasion that almost wiped out the galaxy.
[2:03:23] <+GarboArbo> Rifle is better than repeater
[2:03:25] <%AlexandriasFolly> @Bigyanno The Turians attacked because they are police and Humanity was breaking the space laws they didn't know existed.

[2:03:38] <%Goraka91> Like they didn't even say hi, they went straight to murder
[2:03:53] <Vaxidd8> Explosions in this game are so fuckin satisfying
[2:03:55] <poisin224> Nice.
[2:04:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Turians went "Oh no, how dare you not follow our safety policies that you don't know about!"
[2:04:02] <BritishTyrannosaur> oof that damage
[2:04:02] <%Bigyanno> There is no overkill. There is only open fire and reload
[2:04:04] <%Goraka91> That said, Garrus is best boy
[2:04:05] <+QueequegTheater> This section is way easier with some marines to give those rockets to
[2:04:06] <Lieutenant_America> Turians are cool, but the First Contact War was 100 percent their fault
[2:04:09] <ghoulishcripple> like the contact war made Humans and Turians stronger allies as they respected each other
[2:04:10] <%Javaa01> Lock first then fire
[2:04:12] <%RioGascar> you have to wait for lock on
[2:04:16] <Sp3ctre48> Woolie pls
[2:04:18] <poisin224> lock then fire lmfao

[2:04:22] <%GooseGuy99> Woolie you need to lock on first
[2:04:22] <%brian_peppers1> WOOLIE will figure it out
[2:04:23] <%ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus You have to wait until it locks first dude
[2:04:25] <%wunp_fxs> therre we
[2:04:27] <%brian_peppers1> OR NOT
[2:04:28] <BritishTyrannosaur> tbh locking on banshee's is kinda hard
[2:04:30] <%GooseGuy99> If you fire then lock on, it won't track.
[2:04:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE NotLikeThis
[2:04:35] <%The_Swedish_X> this trailer shot
[2:04:35] <+GarboArbo> I love this scene

[2:05:08] <+Walopoh> SMITE THEM ALIENS
[2:05:10] <%GooseGuy99> Woolie, if you fire before you lock on, it will not track. You need to let it finish locking on first.

[2:06:08] <+KiwiRedgrave> Laszlo LUL
[2:06:08] <Lieutenant_America> Halsey is an interesting character because she DOES genuinely care for the IIs

[2:06:51] <%Goraka91> I don't know ma'am I didn't ask to be a Spartan
[2:06:54] <StebTheVee> @Lieutenant_America Not enough to NOT kidnap them
[2:06:55] <marisot_lemonade> S A S S

[2:07:11] <%huskarl_zap> At least desk secretaries cant just become spartans
[2:07:12] <omen_setter> Hey Jen Taylor, do the Cortana voice but 1000% bitchier
[2:07:20] <Lieutenant_America> @StebTheVee She's still ONI, after all. They start twitching if they don't commit a war crime.
[2:07:23] <%Halospaz117> @vaderxyz1970 Technically, Halsey was not responsible for the IIIs
[2:07:24] <misterurbanthelegend> By the way Woolie, your character is voiced by Jetstream Sam!!

[2:19:10] <Lieutenant_America> Keith Salazzle is a great actor
[2:19:11] <$whiskeybuisness> you are as visible as you appear
[2:19:14] <Nomad94> it has its moments
[2:19:15] <saddlezilla1> god i hope infinite makes Craig into a Bob
[2:19:16] <+slimmixrp> It goes away when you move
[2:19:16] <%The_Swedish_X> you are only perfectly invisible if you stand still
[2:19:18] <$whiskeybuisness> from your pov
[2:19:20] <coreyyotto> Seems like it fades out if you move too fast
[2:19:22] <+IntrepidEye> I think you become visible as you move in this
[2:19:22] <thebalticguy1> Actgive camo is dependent on move speed
[2:19:22] <%Dean_Inbetween> @goraka91 which is funny because harbinger is a new character in infinite
[2:19:24] <+QueequegTheater> "You are invisible" Immediately detected

[2:19:25] <+GarboArbo> The sound dampening is not in your favor for sure
[2:19:27] <+baronothebest> It depends on how fast you are going
[2:19:27] <$laphyrion> ....Is this song just someone slamming a bucket against the ground?
[2:19:28] <idiotscampaign> gotta crouch to do anything with Active camo
[2:19:32] <Lieutenant_America> Drax was right, invisibility is achieved by not moving
[2:19:39] <%Gruhunchously> Is Woolie a boy or a girl?

[2:28:18] <TheChucklingOak> It's surely what the parents would have wanted, right? I mean, it's they're dead, so it's not like they can complain after. Yayyy no moral dilemmas!
[2:28:30] <Lieutenant_America> @saddlezilla1 That was more Parangosky and the rest of ONI's fault, I thought?

[2:29:24] <Lieutenant_America> @Goraka91 I keep asking that question
[2:29:26] <%jorniev> how is woolie doing in this game?
[2:29:26] <TheChucklingOak> Oh hey it's that top 5 game

[2:29:55] <%DianaTheAscian> waoZURA waoZURA waoZURA
[2:29:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, Spartan 3s don't get the most expensive prototypes, and they are trained as whole fireteams. They are meant to take more advantage of numbers and teamwork instead of being capable as a one-man-army.
[2:29:56] <+QueequegTheater> NOOOOOO
[2:29:56] <prime_name> Next time?

[2:30:08] <saddlezilla1> @Lieutenant_America I guess it opens up the whole can of worms concerning if soldiers following orders are complicit in their higher ups actions.
[2:30:10] <TheChucklingOak> THE COAL PORAOTCAL
[2:30:12] <%DSD24> @Solidnick18 The worst is when they still lose

[2:30:39] <jackelzxaa> Little V, probably why there’s some spoiler babies who keep ruining halo for woolie is because they might just be randos who saw a Halo stream happened on twitch and clicked it?
[2:30:40] <Solidnick18> anyways halo
[2:30:42] <Ynkubus_> Its cool the par time is super easy on this
[2:30:46] <andre11dr> Deam ,i thought that thunder sound was outside LUL
[2:30:52] <saddlezilla1> @WoolieVersus y'know Woolz, since y'all paid for the book, I think it'd be fine to burn it on stream as a joke lmao
[2:31:00] <+JeluxDaCasual> Ret-2-Gp

[2:31:07] <%DesertPenguin> C'mon Apex Legends stream when?
[2:31:11] <%brachydios777> I think the pilot helmet was a reference to the SPI armor spartan 3s wear
[2:31:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Halo 2 human weapon pods were rad

[2:36:05] <%biggdaddymike> Guta?
[2:36:07] <dreadedcthulhu> king guta
[2:36:11] <Ynkubus_> Also classed as Mules
[2:36:15] <+Dorf1> @Joestar1890 ok thanks, i didnt realize it wasnt on pc yet
[2:36:26] <%Crow_T_Robot2> Crow_T_Robot2 subscribed at Tier 1.
[2:36:27] <TheChucklingOak> They should bring the Guta back and have enemies ride them
[2:36:29] <IndoorSitup> I have a feeling that Halo Infinite will have lots more wildlife.
[2:36:32] <%Gruhunchously> Gravity can be disproven
[2:36:34] <%DesertPenguin> That's not really true but okay
[2:36:36] <%jorniev> RIDE IT
[2:36:37] <%derap41> V you know what a Theory is right?
[2:36:39] <+notkojima> when your stream deafens your chat permanently, you're in the Red Line
[2:36:41] <BearSawed> 4 5 and odst arent on pc atm I believe
[2:36:42] <wintrysoma> theories are better than facts
[2:36:43] <Darren716> Squared
[2:36:44] <%DesertPenguin> Theory is a proven hypothesis
[2:36:45] <%asd2897> squared
[2:36:47] <SourTortuga> gravitational theory = "the shit just goes down"
[2:36:47] <%NovaKnightmare> V makes Quantam Physicists look like fucking fools
[2:36:50] <dreadedcthulhu> that's not how theories work in science but sure
[2:36:53] <Nomad94> Scientific theories are the frameworks that best explain a fact about the natural world. THERE.
[2:36:53] <saddlezilla1> why would anyone wanna live on Reach if these things are there?
[2:36:55] <TheChucklingOak> "Friendlies"
[2:36:55] <+mechslayer71> Squared
[2:37:01] <+Walopoh> Parts of Gravity are theory. But most of what we know is Law
[2:37:02] <Joestar1890> @Dorf1 The test beta thing for ODST is coming out this month, so we might get it in late August/early September
[2:37:02] <karl_rex> Those aren't marines
[2:37:04] <%Estuko> It's not just a theory... It's a ....
[2:37:04] <%Dean_Inbetween> They were supposed to be in there since halo 1 but bungie took them out since they thought it would take away from the suprise of the flood
[2:37:06] <%The_Timo> V never claimed to be smart, only a jackass lol
[2:37:06] <+MidnightBurst12> "proven"
[2:37:09] <+notkojima> @saddlezilla1 Australia tho

[2:37:30] <+notkojima> @lieutenant_america nice
[2:37:36] <Solidnick18> ooo
[2:37:36] <RunoEddie> did Game Theory ruin the meaning of the word "theory"?

[2:37:48] <saddlezilla1> @notkojima @Lieutenant_America got me there LUL
[2:37:48] <BritishTyrannosaur> give the rebels good weapons remember
[2:37:50] <%Goraka91> @RunoEddie Yes
[2:37:51] <%Gruhunchously> Technically they never left
[2:37:52] <Explodincatz> they never left
[2:37:54] <+notkojima> but that's just a theory
[2:37:59] <Lieutenant_America> Gotta kill the children for the kids
[2:37:59] <+KiwiRedgrave> They do it for their 72 food nipples
[2:38:00] <%BubbaGAN0USH> exploding children, hooray
[2:38:00] <+Walopoh> Theory is why we have gravitational pull. Law is that we fall from whatever it is.
[2:38:03] <+QueequegTheater> WHAT SUBTLE SOCIAL COMMENTARY
[2:38:05] <%Estuko> @RunoEddie Absolutely to the point that it's probably never going to return to normal. LOL
[2:38:05] <AMUSERNAME> why worry about an estimate like "-9.8m/s^2" when you can just give the EXACT number, "g". Kappa
[2:38:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> If you don't say "per second squared" or "per second per second", then you don't really understand acceleration
[2:38:11] <+jiggy_snipe> @RunoEddie no it's been like that for years, people think theory = hypothesis
[2:38:13] <%Goraka91> But that's just a hypothesis, a GAME HYPOTHESIS
[2:38:14] <ripoffproductionsllc> people have failed to understand teh Sientific meaning of "Theory" for a long ass time saddly

[2:38:17] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @RunoEddie only thing Game Theory ruined was their own reputation

[2:39:36] <JayPastaForce> Next LP: CODMW: Warcrimes
[2:39:37] <Sp3ctre48> I always liked to think Grunts started doing the suicide thing after the Brutes took over the Covenant, but I guess this game contradicts that.
[2:39:38] <%RunningNGunning> rip
[2:39:40] <TheChucklingOak> Well then
[2:39:42] <%yhom_tork> f
[2:39:44] <%The_Swedish_X> get those civs those some snipers and they might be useful
[2:39:47] <BritishTyrannosaur> Woolie needs to play MW2 and blops 2. legit the only good campaigns
[2:39:51] <ghoulishcripple> womp womp
[2:39:51] <idiotscampaign> has anyone else noticed that the entire Jackal race has collectively went from left handed to right?
[2:40:00] <+Hansinkdu> Needs like 6 shots
[2:40:06] <Lieutenant_America> @Sp3ctre48 That was indeed the canon when H3 dropped, but Reach retconned it just so the mechanic stayed
[2:40:06] <%Gruhunchously> Remember, Thel Vadamee endorses child suicide bombers
[2:40:08] <stormhawk9891> Ok not slowly, quickly
[2:40:11] <%Goraka91> Think I played from Modern Warfare to World at War
[2:40:15] <Sp3ctre48> I thought so
[2:40:16] <zamzoph> @BritishTyrannosaur RAMIREZ
[2:40:19] <jackelzxaa> Imagine woolie giving up the fight pad for a mouse
[2:40:19] <+Freeborg1997> Isn't Captain Price in every Call of Duty game? I vaguely remember him when I played the original Call of Duty 1.
[2:40:22] <+Aeoneth> Blops 2';s campaign doesn't really hit as well if you haven't played the 1st one though
[2:40:27] <%jorniev> one shot went through the dropship
[2:40:37] <Darren716> Hes just in 1 and the MW trilogy
[2:40:39] <Darren716> Plus 2019
[2:40:43] <%subjectg> @freeborg23 he was in the first cod yeah, you rescued him from a chateau
[2:40:49] <%BubbaGAN0USH> aaaargh
[2:40:50] <LBC921> wtf, is he holding the gun above his shoulder?
[2:40:50] <+GarboArbo> Jun is having a good time
[2:40:53] <DomunDomunDomun> Price was in 2, also.
[2:40:54] <ghoulishcripple> fuck off. you drop ships don't even live here
[2:40:59] <TheChucklingOak> Blops 2 is simultaneously great but disappointing, because David is one of the most boring protags i've EVER seen
[2:41:03] <Lieutenant_America> "That's a damn fine coat you're wearing."
[2:41:05] <Solidnick18> ooh wow

[2:41:50] <TheChucklingOak> Man I always remember how Chad the Ultras were in this game. There's an old clip of one completely decimating everyone
[2:41:52] <Lieutenant_America> Destroying the turrets is wise at least
[2:42:02] <%Estuko> Ultras are so sick
[2:42:03] <The_Lady_Alustriel> I was wondering if they'd ever get around to doing that
[2:42:08] <%Estuko> @TheChucklingOak what on youtube or
[2:42:11] <JayPastaForce> The covenent is using Teamwork
[2:42:15] <Lieutenant_America> The Evocati don't mess around
[2:42:23] <+GarboArbo> The thing that makes the reach elites so scary is that they totally know when they can take you and they FUCKING GO
[2:42:24] <%subjectg> Ultras on LASO take no shits

[2:43:16] <The_Lady_Alustriel> I love sprint in Halo and it blows my mind that some people were upset that it's in Infinite

[2:43:24] <ghoulishcripple> Bunny Hopping Woolie.
[2:43:25] <heartlesshealer> Bethesda in Reach
[2:43:25] <%jorniev> I DID THAT

[2:44:44] <%subjectg> man you should see how they hid iwhbyd in halo 2
[2:44:45] <%RioGascar> that require breaking the game or doing dumb bullshit
[2:44:46] <%AriaMeloetta> Halo 2 dolls are great
[2:44:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @goraka91 Remember the Marathon music in Assault on the Control Room?
[2:44:58] <poisin224> was it always called armor lockup? I thought it was just armor lock in the original game
[2:44:59] <idiotscampaign> anyone else remember downloading theater clips to find out the dumbass noob strats for doing the LASO weekly challenges?
[2:45:08] <+NYGtheGOAT> New Alexandria has great Easter eggs
[2:45:11] <%Goraka91> @GeneralSCPatton Nah i'm a filthy casual
[2:45:15] <%jorniev> I love when people use the armor lock to punch tanks
[2:45:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:45:16] <ghoulishcripple> armor lock is really fun in campaign and I could see an fps being designed around it as a core mechanic

[2:46:18] <Zohare> How has LUWU done this to chat
[2:46:19] <ghoulishcripple> @mechslayer71 shield recharge

[2:46:21] <%Gruhunchously> Then Perish
[2:46:30] <%halfmasks> wonder why woolie pops his armor lock sometimes
[2:46:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @goraka91 If you steal a banshee and fly up that structure before the big doors and hop out onto a tiny support strut that the banshee WILL fall off of, some easter egg music will play while standing in a specific spot.

[2:48:40] <poisin224> not fast enough
[2:48:40] <%koolaid_kevster> you dont have to use the whole charge @WoolieVersus you can use it quick in a pinch to repositioion
[2:48:41] <%condemned_15> Woolie armor lock is not doing what you think its doing
[2:48:43] <%The_Swedish_X> That hunter refused
[2:48:47] <theotrainwreck> what is the step above a dogwhistle?
[2:48:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> YAAY!
[2:48:52] <$whiskeybuisness> my friend would hate fighting me with hologram
[2:48:53] <%BisoromiBear> *it was a hologram*
[2:48:55] <%koolaid_kevster> your armor ablity
[2:48:56] <$whiskeybuisness> he fell for it everytime
[2:48:56] <stormhawk9891> It's Holo-Pilot
[2:48:58] <%subjectg> at least your death brings joy
[2:48:58] <%brachydios777> So nazis are infecting Canada too huh?
[2:48:59] <+KiwiRedgrave> Damn... Looks like CJ walked into the wrong house
[2:48:59] <RunoEddie> ok, what's with the children cheering sound?
[2:48:59] <%Feralspirit41> Ah they killed LUWU
[2:49:03] <TheChucklingOak> Ohh nice weapons switch there woolie
[2:49:04] <Shardlab> Hologram is disgusting in multiplayer
[2:49:08] <SomeAsianDood> it's birthday skull
[2:49:11] <ghoulishcripple> hologram is my favorite in Multiplayer
[2:49:12] <%Goraka91> @RunoEddie Grunt Birthday Party
[2:49:13] <%AlexandriasFolly> Get to bambozling
[2:49:16] <heartlesshealer> hologram's so fun
[2:49:21] <%doomerskeletor13> @runoeddie It’s a skull that makes confetti and cheers when you headshot a grunt
[2:49:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Targical
[2:49:25] <stormhawk9891> It also auto T-bags people
[2:49:25] <fault_417> I hardly see anybody use hologram in multiplayer
[2:49:26] <+MarkUriah> @TheChucklingOak I thought the unite the right rally was when we say those "Jew will not replace us" signs
[2:49:27] <$whiskeybuisness> LUWU mistew huntew, why did you use youw fwuel wod cannon on widdle me
[2:49:28] <BritishTyrannosaur> UwU yow kwilled mw. owchie awooo that hwurt
[2:49:30] <+BurkeBigsby> Wollie must re-learn the basics of Hunter CQC
[2:49:33] <%jorniev> hologram teabags by itself doesn't it?
[2:49:34] <dinnydanny777> It's almost like they wanted to align themselves with that group, while also being able to plead ignorance having already garnered that groups political support, almost like a dogwhistle
[2:49:36] <ghoulishcripple> throw it in reverse like you are retreating and pretend to be the hologram
[2:49:39] <FinalblueMan> i remember getting super salty over people woth hologram
[2:49:40] <Bronks_NYX> 4 games in and still shooting hunters in the front lol
[2:49:42] <%The_Swedish_X> did you guys get the rpg from the waterway?
[2:49:42] <Second_Omega> Hologram in multiplayer is either, the most hype shit, or super boring.
[2:49:48] <Louie_Salmon> If only woolie had armor lockup, it owns hunters
[2:49:49] <%subjectg> i’ve never seen a hologram fool anyone in MP
[2:49:49] <%Dean_Inbetween> Alberta loves there farming and mining so thats why they vote that
[2:49:50] <%halfmasks> SIX remember the basics of CQC!
[2:49:57] <%Superspider51> there's a lot of cool tricks with hologram
[2:50:00] <DigitalJoshie> Woolie: SAVED
[2:50:05] <$whiskeybuisness> it's great for the 3rd party ahead
[2:50:08] <%jorniev> ye
[2:50:08] <+VietcongSamurai> LUL
[2:50:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie-6
[2:50:14] <DigitalJoshie> it's FINE
[2:50:18] <Joestar1890> IT'S FINE
[2:50:19] <FinalblueMan> if you come out of a hallway in multi with hologram it baits people
[2:50:20] <%Superspider51> you can place it where you're standing and stay still inside it to hide
[2:50:24] <Second_Omega> Charging at someone with A hologram in snipers is hillarious
[2:50:24] <%brachydios777> It’s fine
[2:50:25] <+MarkUriah> Woolie has six letters
[2:50:33] <TheChucklingOak> Oh sweet, I didn't notice till now that Woolie is rocking Recon. I did the same my first playthrough
[2:50:34] <ripoffproductionsllc> red?
[2:50:34] <Mr_Strut> Maybe he sees through camera drones
[2:50:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS IT WOOLIE? IS IT? LUL
[2:50:35] <%huskarl_zap> how reddit makes everything
[2:50:40] <%jorniev> hologram teabags other players by itself
[2:50:40] <%Superspider51> you can place it on the ground where you're standing and keep moving to pretend you're the hologram
[2:50:41] <%brachydios777> @markuriah Nice
[2:50:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Nice Qanon you got there Woolie Kappa
[2:50:48] <ghoulishcripple> or if you make it run into a room before you you can check for enemies
[2:50:51] <Louie_Salmon> The AI specifically targets the hologram
[2:50:54] <saddlezilla1> u can break this level by getting thru these doors w/ forklift dismount btw
[2:51:00] <Joestar1890> Decoys can Teabag oppoents
[2:51:04] <BritishTyrannosaur> Like the modern game
[2:51:05] <%Javaa01> Yeah this is what they got Holo Pilot from
[2:51:06] <%subjectg> @finalblueman the big problem i remember is that it shows up as a white blip instead of red in multi
[2:51:08] <%doomerskeletor13> I completely forgot about holograms
[2:51:16] <+GarboArbo> Apex has ruined every other hologram in gaming for me. He's so GOOD
[2:51:26] <dinnydanny777> In the UK people were "counter protesting" against taking down statues in London of famous figures like Churchill and against Black Lives Matter, they were pictured doing Nazi salutes and peeing on a memorial to a murdered police officer
[2:51:34] <Shardlab> Doing it from near a corner makes so many folks just waste their ammo
[2:51:50] <%doomerskeletor13> ItsHappening ItsHappening ItsHappening ItsHappening
[2:51:59] <ghoulishcripple> a jumping hologram scares the Monkey part of the brain. bet
[2:52:00] <TheChucklingOak> Okay chat, let's cool it with the depressing political stuff now. We
[2:52:01] <LoadingFWANK> gettin BAMBOOZLED
[2:52:04] <%slppanther29> SourPls
[2:52:05] <+GarboArbo> Yeah it's bull lol
[2:52:07] <TheChucklingOak> We're here to laugh not feel
[2:52:11] <%The_Swedish_X> AI cheats in video games. Shocker.
[2:52:13] <idiotscampaign> you should see the tech's that people do with Hologram online, like major Big Brain dukes
[2:52:19] <poisin224> we gonna talk about the physical possibility of PLASMA WEAPONS lmao
[2:52:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:52:21] <+mechslayer71> I hope they do one more level after this? The next one is great
[2:52:25] <BritishTyrannosaur> Yeah talk insted about halo's politics
[2:52:25] <Sp3ctre48> SourPls
[2:52:26] <%subjectg> I love the legendary shade though, it feels like real-ass AA
[2:52:27] <%doomerskeletor13> These aliens aren’t playing by da rules
[2:52:29] <%nxflre> M<usic in this game is soooo fucking gooood
[2:52:38] <+ntfth> SourPls
[2:52:40] <+GarboArbo> Great music
[2:52:43] <ripoffproductionsllc> @dinnydanny777 those weren't nazi solutes, they were doing football cheer waves or whatever they're called(I'm not a sport fan, so terms elude me)
[2:52:44] <BritishTyrannosaur> like every piece of media set after halo 3 is a post 9/11 allegory
[2:52:45] <@akuda_bar> yeah chat no more politics
[2:52:52] <%brachydios777> Remember when ONI kidnapped those kids?
[2:52:55] <theotrainwreck> just wrote a paper on how the alt right recruits online for school. Anyways no more depressing bullshit. haha grunt got *pop* YAAAAY
[2:52:57] <Torivore> I never found the Halo holograms useful, but holo pilot in Titanfall 2 is ridiculous because it still shows your nametag on it
[2:53:02] <%The_Swedish_X> we here for dumb shoot games
[2:53:05] <@akuda_bar> this is the politics are over line and if you post politics after it ur a bad ---
[2:53:07] <%alpacasintophats> sniper rifle is king at anti shade warfare
[2:53:09] <BritishTyrannosaur> No i don't remember ONI covered it up lol
[2:53:13] <%alpacasintophats> as one mag is a dead shade
[2:53:14] <%Dean_Inbetween> Remember when master chief was created to kill over taxed space farmers
[2:53:16] <poisin224> halo is an inherently political franchise, to seperate it from politics is to lose half of whats good about it
[2:53:17] <+BurkeBigsby> atpWind atpLaw2
[2:53:24] <%alpacasintophats> meaning you can use it to kill an ultra if it's in the seat
[2:53:25] <@Menitta> I get back and this conversation goes
[2:53:26] <Depthcharge2030> i remember the h4 hologram teabagged for you
[2:53:33] <JetpackMcQuack> SourPls
[2:53:37] <ghoulishcripple> my problem with holopilot is the grappling hook is too fun to use anything but
[2:53:37] <Targical> Halo4 hologram was practically useless cuz it didn’t sprint
[2:53:37] <+GarboArbo> I FORGOT
[2:53:37] <Depthcharge2030> lovely feature
[2:53:38] <$whiskeybuisness> @Depthcharge2030 that's awesome
[2:53:43] <%doomerskeletor13> SourPls
[2:53:47] <%Goraka91> Remember when ONI used the Flood in prisoners of war, and the odd ''undesirable''?
[2:54:05] <Targical> In multiplayer at least
[2:54:07] <%The_Swedish_X> having a rocket bro in this zone helped a lot the other day
[2:54:08] <+GarboArbo> Ok halo 4 isn't so bad
[2:54:09] <TheChucklingOak> Hey Halo politics is fine, but again we're getting into book stuff that maybe someday Woolie may read, so we should still cool it
[2:54:11] <@Menitta> @ghoulishcripple thats why holo pilot nova is the shit
[2:54:16] <%brachydios777> Yeah we are at the limit for talking about real stuff happening
[2:54:17] <poisin224> no more politics in our child soldier game, thnx
[2:54:25] <BritishTyrannosaur> Halo 5 had oni developing big genocide gas
[2:54:27] <+ntfth> Remember the whole #HuntTheTruth promo? Yikes.
[2:54:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Lets get back to killing child soldiers
[2:54:34] <%Theycallmenerf> Hey chat, I forgot about the other jackal like race in Reach, are they related to the Jackals/Kig-Yar?
[2:54:37] <Depthcharge2030> that was also a selling point for a certain new vehicle in h4 as well, that it could teabag
[2:54:43] <theotrainwreck> ""stop putting politics in my bideyo gaems" BabyRage
[2:54:45] <%brachydios777> @ntfth Big Lies
[2:54:52] <%The_Swedish_X> Still never even watched Halo 5's campaign.
[2:54:55] <%subjectg> As much as I think Halo is political, surely there’s a far better place to air your grievances?
[2:54:55] <TheChucklingOak> They're "skirmishers", some subspecies of Jackal
[2:54:56] <+Kqha4000> I think skirmishers are a related species
[2:55:00] <DomunDomunDomun> Skirmishers are the start of the stupid "It's a subspecies" bullshit that 343 ran with, yeah.
[2:55:00] <+palestinianmario> god i got so invested in that and it was NOTHING @ntfth
[2:55:02] <BritishTyrannosaur> Yeah skirmishers are a subspecies from the kig-yar moon
[2:55:03] <Torivore> I'm a Titanfall 1 boomer so I almost exclusively used stim. Didn't even try grapple in 2 until after Apex came out
[2:55:04] <%halfmasks> woolie would do so much better with a sniper of some kind right now
[2:55:07] <%Goraka91> @Theycallmenerf Skirmisher Jackals yeah, they come from the asteroid fields of the Jackal's home system when the gravity changed them, they think they're hot shit
[2:55:09] <%Dean_Inbetween> A video games that message is blatantly religious fundamentalism is bad
[2:55:10] <%halfmasks> speak of the devil
[2:55:12] <$whiskeybuisness> I think they have a Halo Movie on netflix that is just a TL;DR of fall of reach and has a reuinion scene for John Halo's team in 5
[2:55:14] <Second_Omega> "I know Based Kojumbo wont' put politic in his game"
[2:55:21] <ghoulishcripple> @menitta fair. I mean really what matters is which titan you run and why its ronin
[2:55:24] <BritishTyrannosaur> They can jump like that because of superman gravity logic
[2:55:31] <%brave_sj> @Theycallmenerf They're a subspecies of Jackal. They're nearly wiped out on Reach which is the justification for not seeing any in the other games
[2:55:32] <fault_417> Skirmishers canonically went extinct during the battle of reach
[2:55:33] <%Dean_Inbetween> Didn’t the halo movie just become district 9
[2:55:33] <+NYGtheGOAT> Why is being a subspecies bad lmfao
[2:55:38] <%Dean_Inbetween> Speaking of politics
[2:55:47] <@Menitta> (sweats in scorch) yeah...
[2:55:49] <TheChucklingOak> Skirmishers do look cooler, but I still think the old emaciated looking ones from the previous games look freakier
[2:55:51] <Depthcharge2030> the politics of teabagging
[2:55:55] <%RunningNGunning> AI privileged
[2:55:58] <%brachydios777> @dean_inbetween Basically, spiders were flood spores
[2:55:59] <+NYGtheGOAT> halo fans reach so hard for things to hate
[2:55:59] <%Goraka91> @fault_417 Nah, they just suffered catastrophic losses and weren't deployed in the rest of the war
[2:56:00] <%doomerskeletor13> There are a few covenant species that don’t appear in the games
[2:56:04] <sniffy77> dumb tree
[2:56:07] <%The_Swedish_X> Legendary never feels fun, and just gets worse as games go on
[2:56:09] <fault_417> Whoops
[2:56:11] <wragglee> gg
[2:56:17] <%Theycallmenerf> I like the Skirmishers, I liked seeing a wider variety that was in the Covenant.
[2:56:17] <+Kqha4000> Anything but H4 and H5 Jackals
[2:56:24] <FinalblueMan> that final mission on legendary...
[2:56:26] <BritishTyrannosaur> Tbf how could skirmishers not be a subspecies. even bungie made them different enough
[2:56:29] <%brachydios777> @the_swedish_x Agreed
[2:56:33] <overlord_nico> The skirmishers are kinda like the Ogryn from 40k. They get larger growing up in space that they essentially became their own subspecies
[2:56:34] <Nomad94> Legendary is lots of fun in coop
[2:56:35] <%slppanther29> I actually think Reach Legendary is fun
[2:56:36] <%Dean_Inbetween> The guys who were going to make the halo movie ended up using tons of the assets and money and made district 9
[2:56:38] <%Estuko> @The_Swedish_X FeelsBadMan seeing othe people say that helps confirm and validate my reason to not wanting to play Legendary
[2:56:38] <%slppanther29> doodDerp
[2:56:43] <+MarkUriah> Sprint is the best
[2:56:48] <%The_Swedish_X> Co op is fine
[2:56:51] <$whiskeybuisness> this was the only halo game i got all 1000 cheiveo points on
[2:56:51] <%subjectg> Legendary in Reach is pretty cool and not nearly as BS
[2:56:53] <+Aeriqui> mirage mains have big big brains now
[2:56:53] <%The_Swedish_X> but solo is such a drag
[2:56:53] <+Freeborg1997> Butts
[2:56:56] <%RunningNGunning> THICC
[2:56:57] <poisin224> the next cut scene thooooooooo i cant wait
[2:56:58] <%Dean_Inbetween> Reach on legendary might be worse than halo 2 on legendary
[2:56:58] <@akuda_bar> THICC
[2:56:58] <$whiskeybuisness> the solo legendary one was rough
[2:57:01] <prime_name> THICC BOI
[2:57:02] <BritishTyrannosaur> big male butt
[2:57:03] <%Goraka91> @Theycallmenerf The alien equivalent of the various human cultures is great
[2:57:05] <wragglee> j-jackpot?
[2:57:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Thicc
[2:57:09] <+GarboArbo> Sprint is like the best ability
[2:57:13] <BritishTyrannosaur> Don;t you dare say it
[2:57:13] <+mechslayer71> Please one more level, the next scene is dope
[2:57:15] <%Dean_Inbetween> Squeezy
[2:57:17] <BritishTyrannosaur> JACKPOT
[2:57:18] <sniffy77> carter im trying to spy on the covenant but my ass is dummy thicc
[2:57:23] <%The_Swedish_X> I don't think we get a name
[2:57:23] <+KiwiRedgrave> "Oh God.... Purple!"
[2:57:25] <misterurbanthelegend> Woolie your character is voiced by Phillip Anthony Rodriguez AKA Jetstream Sam Rodriguez!!
[2:57:26] <+GarboArbo> simple but powerful
[2:57:27] <$whiskeybuisness> next 2 missions are awesome
[2:57:30] <%Superspider51> there was 2 ships there
[2:57:31] <ghoulishcripple> Legendary runs with the lads is something I wouldn't trade for the world. I cant count how many times we had 4 xboxes in one room playing through
[2:57:31] <+JohnRSoviet> There's a corvette on the right side
[2:57:33] <%slppanther29> Its a giant camp
[2:57:33] <%jorniev> Kat... the worst driver
[2:57:35] <@akuda_bar> @misterurbanthelegend yo
[2:57:35] <%alpacasintophats> it's a landing zone
[2:57:37] <rytisone> let's go
[2:57:37] <iamtheTwitchghost> maybe
[2:57:40] <%DSD24> This is a good mission
[2:57:41] <%yhom_tork> YEYEYEYE

[2:59:53] <Shardlab> Junkrat gun
[2:59:54] <+Zyquux> EMP Launcher Pog
[2:59:56] <%Goraka91> Destiny is entirely just Halo huh
[2:59:59] <+JohnRSoviet> reach's grenade launcher is an underappreciated weapon
[3:00:00] <BritishTyrannosaur> guess that's empty
[3:00:02] <Huntercd> Haru would be pleased
[3:00:03] <%RunningNGunning> yaaaay
[3:00:03] <+A_mere_shrubb> Honestly the nade launcher is pretty bad
[3:00:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Me run towards plasma shot octoUnga
[3:00:07] <FinalblueMan> if you hold it you can decide when it goes boom :)
[3:00:08] <%subjectg> Fuel rod turrets in reach are assholes
[3:00:08] <TheChucklingOak> Oh woolie you don't even know. Kat is weirdly bad at driving, even more so than seemingly other AI. I have no idea why that is, if they screwed with her pathfinding as a joke or something
[3:00:13] <dinnydanny777> This sure is a war
[3:00:18] <Second_Omega> The launcher is pretty great
[3:00:19] <%jorniev> V make Kat drive FOR FUNSIES
[3:00:23] <heartlesshealer> mmm shrapnel physics
[3:00:28] <%AlexandriasFolly> ROCKET HOG!
[3:00:30] <%slppanther29> DONT LET KAT DRIVE
[3:00:30] <$whiskeybuisness> @JohnRSoviet the GL had a hell of a learning curve
[3:00:31] <+Zyquux> made launcher is great for hijacking banshees at THAT part if the campaign
[3:00:32] <AppleBerryKitty> Let cat drive :3
[3:00:33] <%yhom_tork> YEYEYE
[3:00:37] <%biggdaddymike> Let Kat drive
[3:00:38] <%Dean_Inbetween> Also a single shot grenade launcher is incredibly anachronistic for the 2500s...
[3:00:40] <Torivore> Robo arm hard to drive with
[3:00:42] <+eiightbiitt> the Pro pipe
[3:00:43] <Solidnick18> yes

[3:01:28] <Shinny1338> that was a good line and angle
[3:01:32] <Shinny1338> super consistent
[3:01:33] <+Zyquux> Pounding Kreygasm
[3:01:36] <Shinny1338> 85/100
[3:01:38] <%Gruhunchously> V: Hole my beer
[3:01:43] <%alpacasintophats> just shoot the gun
[3:01:45] <%jorniev> V Totally knows about Kat doesn't he
[3:01:45] <saddlezilla1> @TheChucklingOak is there any way to test if Kat's AI is definetevely worse than the others? Cuz like, Emile's pretty bad too
[3:01:49] <Zohare> gun does not take damage
[3:01:50] <idiotscampaign> YES YOU CAN!!!
[3:01:55] <%alpacasintophats> YOU TOTALLY CAN
[3:01:56] <%Superspider51> you can blow it up with enough damage

[3:02:23] <%Dean_Inbetween> @subjectg well balistically there’s nothing really wrong with the 7.62 also i always took that as the US military industrial complex won out in the arming of the military when the UNSC was formed

[3:02:39] <TheChucklingOak> Oh yeah, I remember Emile would mess up that one jump in that level near the end. Maybe Reach AI pathfinding just wasn't as sophisticated?

[3:03:04] <%yhom_tork> SourPls
[3:03:05] <marisot_lemonade> the radio chatter is my favourite thing about this game
[3:03:05] <%Halospaz117> Halo Reach definitely has the best feeling of putting you in the middle of the Human-Covenant War
[3:03:05] <+GarboArbo> WELCOME TO REACH
[3:03:07] <+JohnRSoviet> now THAT'S a war
[3:03:10] <heartlesshealer> fucking DAMN

[3:03:17] <+JohnRSoviet> THE BOYS
[3:03:18] <%Estuko> GIANT SPACE GUN
[3:03:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> frigates
[3:03:22] <Joestar1890> GUN SHIPS
[3:03:22] <Minerslovegames> This would have saved me so much time. Jesus.
[3:03:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IF HALO HAD TITANS IT WOULD BE COMPLETE
[3:03:28] <Solidnick18> lot's of giant ships man
[3:03:29] <%Goraka91> Look at that glassing in the background
[3:03:35] <$whiskeybuisness> bungie is great at skyboxes. they made a destiny event that was just stare at the skybox
[3:03:36] <JayPastaForce> Ships, with guns, Gunships
[3:03:38] <wintrysoma> how exactly do they hover there, they have no upward thrust
[3:03:39] <JetpackMcQuack> That's a bad time
[3:03:40] <%Superspider51> @BallerSwagBro9k Halo 4 has mechs and we got ODST's
[3:03:42] <%Estuko> @BallerSwagBro9k I wanna see that giant thing transform into a transformer FeelsBad
[3:03:48] <DPmusique> Reach gets fucked bad
[3:03:50] <$whiskeybuisness> @wintrysoma space magic
[3:03:51] <%subjectg> @dean_inbetween standardization and all, but you’d think we’d have mini-apfsds by now
[3:03:51] <%brachydios777> @ballerswagbro9k You don’t even know!?
[3:03:54] <poisin224> yes we all remember Bagdhad 03
[3:03:55] <Torivore> YapYap could take Reach on his own
[3:03:57] <%RioGascar> this is a global war for the planet of reach. and bungie sells it very well
[3:03:57] <%Javaa01> Hmmm, if only there was something like that in a Halo game
[3:03:59] <+QueequegTheater> @Superspider51 He doesn't mean TItanfall Titans
[3:03:59] <+KiwiRedgrave> The reason the covenant would glass planets is because when humans kicked too much ass they had no choice
[3:04:01] <correctedsun117> @ballerswagbro9k later games actually have mechs
[3:04:01] <+GarboArbo> This game is very scary honestly
[3:04:05] <Joestar1890> @BallerSwagBro9k Halo with MECHS? That would NEEEVER happen! Nope! Never!
[3:04:09] <%jorniev> I remember that from 2 years ago
[3:04:12] <+GarboArbo> Especially later
[3:04:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the Yugoslav wars

[3:05:06] <%Dean_Inbetween> @subjectg didn’t they try that multiple times in the cold war? And the technology was never practical enough or stable enough for them to make it be widespread
[3:05:12] <%brave_sj> JACK IT
[3:05:14] <%DesertPenguin> Stop being trolls just because you think you're getting a response out of it. Just stop

[3:05:57] <%halfmasks> WOOLIE IS IN
[3:05:57] <+GarboArbo> Give it a go
[3:06:01] <%jorniev> yeeeah
[3:06:02] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Nice Job Woolie!
[3:06:07] <BritishTyrannosaur> remember blowing up a revenant and the back off flew off and killed me. fun times
[3:06:07] <%brave_sj> Woolie IS Figuring It Out!
[3:06:11] <Louie_Salmon> Let Kat drive!
[3:06:14] <heartlesshealer> Did Kat ram into Woolie for damage?
[3:06:19] <%jorniev> when in rome
[3:06:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:06:23] <idiotscampaign> behold, the best vehicle
[3:06:25] <dinnydanny777> Let Kat Drive!
[3:06:26] <%BisoromiBear> how long until kat kills woolie?
[3:06:26] <@Menitta> KAT PLEASE
[3:06:29] <%Gruhunchously> It's that funny thing where the designs in the prequel look more advanced.
[3:06:32] <$whiskeybuisness> kat, stop armor locking. V is driving, not woolie
[3:06:34] <Sp3ctre48> She's totally gonna kill you
[3:06:38] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> Ram the ghost
[3:06:41] <Crippl3> big boom boyz
[3:06:44] <%Dean_Inbetween> @subjectg maybe but halo has never really gone too deep into that other than the absurd idea of neo nazis and neo communists taking over the solar system LUL
[3:06:46] <+barrakuta371> hit the boost woolie
[3:06:52] <%biggdaddymike> #LetKatTakeTheWheel
[3:06:54] <%subjectg> @britishtyrannosaur remember how revenants and wraiths sometimes fly off at mach speed for no reason?
[3:06:59] <AMUSERNAME> Pelican delivering a bridge
[3:07:00] <%alpacasintophats> where's the wraith?
[3:07:02] <%Tearonex> Woolie doesn't know it has boost
[3:07:09] <%cowardman93> woolie go now
[3:07:10] <%brave_sj> 60 feet of bridge
[3:07:12] <%RunningNGunning> On Legendary theres a Wraith here thats an asshole
[3:07:16] <Crippl3> woolie
[3:07:17] <%cowardman93> WHY!?
[3:07:17] <stormhawk9891> Why
[3:07:19] <poisin224> why
[3:07:20] <+GarboArbo> Covenant totally don't stand a chance lol
[3:07:21] <%condemned_15> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:07:21] <TheChucklingOak> Wh...why?
[3:07:22] <Nomad94> why
[3:07:22] <delerim001> why
[3:07:24] <Joestar1890> @BallerSwagBro9k There's also the Halo Wars Cyclops which is more humanoid looking
[3:07:24] <%The_Swedish_X> mistakes were made
[3:07:24] <idiotscampaign> oof
[3:07:26] <FinalblueMan> they acfually gave a reason why everything looks more advanced. Reach was known for very advanced technology that was lost when the planet got glassed
[3:07:28] <%alpacasintophats> @RunningNGunning that wraith should be there period
[3:07:31] <heartlesshealer> woolie couldn't see the hurt direction arrows
[3:07:38] <%alpacasintophats> like there should be a wraith in that spot
[3:07:39] <pochecito> What was your plan Woolie?
[3:07:41] <%doomerskeletor13> @dean_inbetween They didn’t take over the solar system, they were just finite over Jupiter moons
[3:07:43] <BritishTyrannosaur> tbh the worst vehucle physiscs are trying to rise in a halo 1 warthog and getting splattered
[3:07:46] <dinnydanny777> @finalblueman But why do the Covenant have different guns tho
[3:07:50] <BritishTyrannosaur> ride*
[3:07:51] <Crippl3> It's really underpowered if you get out of it in front of 3 enemies and a gunship
[3:07:59] <+QueequegTheater> It's too much of a middle ground between Ghost and Wrait
[3:08:06] <%Estuko> @BritishTyrannosaur the racing mode LUL
[3:08:07] <fault_417> Different detachments of the supreme commander’s army?
[3:08:10] <%RioGascar> you can absolutely bring that rocket hog with you
[3:08:12] <Torivore> Advanced technology like semi auto rifles
[3:08:14] <dinnydanny777> It's a GOOD JEEP
[3:08:16] <alrobot2014> it ain't broke
[3:08:17] <+Pequod1> just like in real life
[3:08:18] <%DappercatEsquire> JEEP WAR
[3:08:21] <Ynkubus_> Technicals are the shit
[3:08:23] <Louie_Salmon> GREEN
[3:08:25] <LeBlanc233> easy and cheep to produce
[3:08:26] <JayPastaForce> Green reticle
[3:08:26] <%Halospaz117> How long til they stick a scorpion gun on a tank?
[3:08:26] <+IntrepidEye> Just like with Humvees
[3:08:27] <+KiwiRedgrave> THe covenant cand handle it
[3:08:28] <Joestar1890> GOOD JEEPS
[3:08:28] <Explodincatz> ever ending tanks
[3:08:31] <%Halospaz117> *warthog
[3:08:32] <Lieutenant_America> "The Jeep That Won the War"
[3:08:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Reach is one of the biggest suppliers of titanium
[3:08:33] <%RioGascar> i mean the US military ALSO JUST DRIVES JEEPS
[3:08:33] <%yhom_tork> DO IT
[3:08:38] <+Pequod1> Command vehicle? HMMV, Bridge layer? HMMV
[3:08:39] <%RunningNGunning> Listen, space Toyota knows how to make damn fine vehicles
[3:08:40] <dinnydanny777> I bet you're gonna fall off the bridge
[3:08:40] <%slppanther29> *Fortunate Son begins to play
[3:08:40] <+GarboArbo> The halo 1 warthog is the deadliest thing in the galaxy and the turret has nothing to do with it lol
[3:08:41] <%jorniev> warthogs have some of the most insane durability according to the lore
[3:08:42] <%AlexandriasFolly> You can totally get this one through
[3:08:42] <%RioGascar> and some of em suck from what i hear
[3:08:43] <thebestestkevin> i think the idea was the covenant's tech was so lethal that the way to counter it was just by being faster
[3:08:44] <Yummy_Nukes> jeeps and atvs
[3:08:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE NOOOO
[3:08:45] <TheChucklingOak> Now they just need to install a Machine Gun in the passenger seat in addition to the Rocket or Gauss cannon
[3:08:48] <%subjectg> Toyota Hilux is the best IFV, AA, AT...
[3:08:51] <FinalblueMan> I like how woolie sees the green and STILL shoots
[3:08:53] <saddlezilla1> @QueequegTheater speaking of vehicles... over-under on Blister's in Infinite?

[3:09:07] <Second_Omega> BEEPBLOOP
[3:09:14] <+IntrepidEye> Funny thing is the Warthog is like twice the size of a Humvee which is already laughably big

[3:17:46] <%huskarl_zap> E v a wasnt that hard in the orginal

[3:19:46] <Joestar1890> ODST

[3:22:39] <+Walopoh> Woolie didn't know about the AI not being copyable. That part specifically may be important
[3:22:41] <$LetsGitGud> remember reach
[3:22:45] <FreedomARX7> Solid Snake ''Not with that walk''
[3:22:46] <+GarboArbo> Vidmaster challenges bro
[3:22:46] <%RioGascar> remember recon
[3:22:46] <%DSD24> Hayabusa one
[3:22:47] <+QueequegTheater> HAYABUSA
[3:22:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Multiplayer always had character creation
[3:22:54] <%phatmac16> Remember when Reach had pics of Female ass in the Forge mode?
[3:22:59] <FinalblueMan> multiplayer only
[3:23:00] <TheChucklingOak> All the Reach female spartans look wayyyy too thick. They should be resembling the build of the male spartans, it makes the idea of super-soldier more interesting
[3:23:00] <BenTensCousin> oh shit thought we were gonna ODST
[3:23:00] <%subjectg> One guy managed to get recon by getting killed by a traffic cone

[3:23:20] <BenTensCousin> Vidmaster achievements were the worst and best achievements
[3:23:20] <idiotscampaign> Might be worth checking out the Halo 3 Armours
[3:23:20] <%Javaa01> In this you gotta kill someone that works at 343 or has the achievement already
[3:23:22] <Vaxidd8> I think Roosterteeth played a little bit of a partin that
[3:23:31] <+MarkUriah> I think it's cool
[3:23:36] <poisin224> all character creators prove is that gender is a fuck
[3:23:41] <%RioGascar> rooster teeth did not have recon at the start
[3:23:42] <%RioGascar> and god

[3:38:26] <+GarboArbo> fAIR
[3:38:27] <idiotscampaign> can V's Spartan 3 rant be a new copypasta?
[3:38:27] <$jake5713> Sorry about game story spoilers earlier, let's try this again. Smart AI in Halo are unique & can't be backed up cuz they're formatted from the brains of deceased UNSC officers. So they're completely one of a kind, Cortana moreso cuz reasons you'll find out later.
[3:38:30] <BlackermanZX> please glass
[3:38:31] <%Halospaz117> That's a good quote

[3:38:59] <vulkan_vibes> good pull
[3:38:59] <%subjectg> @condemned_15 naw man, that’s boring as shit. they should be taking initiative by just ignoring those donos, since it just empowers people, ya know?
[3:38:59] <DatAsuna> samus crossed with starfox i guess
[3:39:01] <WolfemanMaverik> Chief as a Snake clone?
[3:39:01] <saddlezilla1> GLASS THE CHAT
[3:39:02] <+Pyroclase> I wanna see Gordon Freeman in smash just yeeting toilets at people.
[3:39:03] <%jorniev> MORGAN FREEMAN
[3:39:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Spartan level 4 is known for the monkey like fur and regrowth of the tail but it was only in Halo GT
[3:39:06] <%RioGascar> doom has the legacy but also so does halo
[3:39:08] <%alpacasintophats> disagree with badness of Cole Protocol. That book is ok to good.
[3:39:08] <%Irridium> BRING BACK NICOLE FOR DOA6 COWARDS
[3:39:08] <%halfmasks> NO MORE LORE DUMPS ON WOOLIE
[3:39:10] <%nxflre> @jake5713 bruh just shut up

[3:39:29] <SomeAsianDood> Gimme Majima in SSB
[3:39:34] <TheChucklingOak> All Spartan women should look like Nicole. Anything less is the coward way
[3:39:34] <%BurdRightsActivist> Joker is a SHIT Choice. Should've been a SMT character
[3:39:36] <Torivore> So f
[3:39:37] <drewslo> still has to be on a Nintendo tho
[3:39:37] <Targical> Might as well throw in the DOA spartan again lol
[3:39:38] <%superc37> spartans *do* have jetpacks...
[3:39:38] <+CSNG> Master Chief seems like he would be a mix of Samus and Snake
[3:39:41] <%halfmasks> if woolie wants to know he'll ask
[3:39:43] <+QueequegTheater> Put Kiryu in Smash
[3:39:44] <andre11dr> Well ,caracters made in Japan that is
[3:39:45] <%jorniev> no way! the elite super hero! HE WAS IN KILLER INSTINCT
[3:39:46] <prime_name> So Snake?
[3:39:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Put Francis York Morgan in Smash you cowards
[3:39:50] <+GarboArbo> That is the real reason
[3:39:52] <Pookiedaexzile> MArcus Fenix for Smash
[3:39:55] <+QueequegTheater> That's a very strong argument
[3:39:55] <Zayasu> banjo kazooie too
[3:39:56] <%huskarl_zap> Nuke dukem for smash
[3:40:00] <idiotscampaign> i mean the Japanese already call Ridley Captain America
[3:40:02] <eldragon_1> Yep
[3:40:04] <%brian_peppers1> AMUUURICA FUCK YEAH
[3:40:07] <bearwagon> nice
[3:40:07] <+GarboArbo> LOL
[3:40:10] <+jiggy_snipe> I imagine MGS is popular in Japan too
[3:40:10] <%subjectg> @alpacasintophats it’s not bad and it’s great for world-building. But I don’t think it’s good either
[3:40:10] <%jorniev> BILLIY AND.JIMMY
[3:40:11] <idiotscampaign> oh hr just said it lol
[3:40:11] <DatAsuna> Sam Gideon from vanquish
[3:40:13] <+xerotwo> doodLUL
[3:40:15] <%huskarl_zap> captain america sucks
[3:40:21] <TheChucklingOak> I love Halo more than any otherr game, but Doomguy is a better FPS rep than Cheif, and more interesting moveset wise
[3:40:25] <%brachydios777> Is banjo kazooi the only western character?
[3:40:27] <%alpacasintophats> @subjectg hence ok to good and not outright bad
[3:40:30] <%Halospaz117> Henry Stickmin for smash
[3:40:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Duke Nukem for Smash
[3:40:39] <DatAsuna> the west will have their mii fighter costumes and like it
[3:40:41] <+afroking42> snake?
[3:40:47] <%KaitlynnHere> Japan is like ba sing sa, they don’t like war
[3:40:48] <FerwhateverDota> i mean there is snake arleady
[3:40:48] <heartlesshealer> they are only gun man
[3:40:48] <idiotscampaign> @datasuna i never thought of this but i'm 100% behind it. that would be sick
[3:40:51] <TheChucklingOak> Aww even the Eternal version?
[3:41:01] <+jiggy_snipe> but that's Konami
[3:41:03] <+xerotwo> SNEAKING SUIT
[3:41:07] <%GraceTBM> they're HYPER violent compared to the other characters in the game for fucks sake
[3:41:07] <+jiggy_snipe> PogChamp
[3:41:07] <%BubbaGAN0USH> badum tsss
[3:41:08] <+JeluxDaCasual> Ba Sing Sa
[3:41:08] <%halfmasks> put RAIDEN INSTEAD
[3:41:09] <+paladinstarbuster> Doomguy is cooler than Samus IMO
[3:41:09] <+MarkUriah> LUL
[3:41:11] <%Halospaz117> EYYYYYYYY
[3:41:14] <+QueequegTheater> HAHAHAHA FUNNY
[3:41:14] <Lieutenant_America> So the solution is to bring in ARBITER
[3:41:15] <DatAsuna> Snake's been on the NES/gameboy and gamecube
[3:41:17] <%doomerskeletor13> SMASH THEM brownW
[3:41:17] <%phatmac16> Snake has decent popularity in Japan
[3:41:18] <%brian_peppers1> 2016 DOOM SUIT>>>>ETERNAL SUIT
[3:41:18] <DatAsuna> And now 3DS
[3:41:19] <$emptyantics> JUST ADD RAIDEN
[3:41:20] <%jorniev> ARBITER WOULD BE SO GOOD
[3:41:21] <%Foopoof> Giggity
[3:41:25] <TheChucklingOak> Bayonetta got in and she's super violent AND sexual
[3:41:26] <+JeluxDaCasual> ooo, Arbiter!
[3:41:28] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Yo V ready to hit the protein shale
[3:41:28] <plankk56> chief would be do-able, someone made a solid character of him in brawlhalla
[3:41:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Scorpian would get into smash first
[3:41:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:41:34] <DatAsuna> When's guitaroo man?
[3:41:35] <%biggdaddymike> Isn't the Mjolnir Suit Design cool?
[3:41:38] <BritishTyrannosaur> we need arbiter from killer instinct in smash
[3:41:41] <%AlexandriasFolly> Sly Cooper would likely have an easier time getting in.
[3:41:44] <prime_name> 2006?
[3:41:44] <+xerotwo> 2001
[3:41:44] <%DesertPenguin> Yea Melee
[3:41:45] <+Nothing_Wild> I think Doom Guy and Chief have good designs, but if they were both in the game, it’d be bad. They look too similar.
[3:41:48] <+CSNG> Thst's why we need Dante in Smash, he has guns AND he's an anime swordman
[3:41:48] <heartlesshealer> near start of gamecube I think
[3:41:49] <+jiggy_snipe> @TheChucklingOak but she's from a Japanese company
[3:41:53] <%DesertPenguin> I never got a Wii so Melee was my last Smash game
[3:41:56] <%subjectg> My feelings on it are that my expectations are low, and that I much prefer getting Reimu in Smash for ALL the music
[3:41:57] <%DesertPenguin> High school man
[3:41:58] <%DesertPenguin> good times
[3:42:00] <%BurdRightsActivist> So the WORST ONE? 4Head
[3:42:03] <+Nothing_Wild> And there’s already Samus in there.
[3:42:05] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Melee was at the beginning of gamecube
[3:42:07] <+GarboArbo> PUT TARTARUS IN SMASH
[3:42:11] <+CSNG> @subjectg hell yeah
[3:42:12] <OldOnyx> Doomguy is more classic video games ass video games compared to chief
[3:42:14] <saddlezilla1> tbh I'm good w/ whoever, I just hope Sora and Geno don't get in cuz it'd make ppl mad Kappa
[3:42:14] <TheChucklingOak> Right, just saying that a character's propensity for violence doesn't disqualify them
[3:42:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Kratos in Smash
[3:42:22] <%halfmasks> why not paper mario in smash too
[3:42:28] <BritishTyrannosaur> Tartarus, sakurai has betrayed us
[3:42:31] <+Nothing_Wild> Doom Slayer would honestly be the better choice to add.
[3:42:32] <%DesertPenguin> Reggie is an actual fighting game pro
[3:42:36] <%brian_peppers1> WILL NOT LOOK GOOD ON A RESUME
[3:42:37] <%CraftofPaper> Smash IS A PARTY GAME, SO SAYS V
[3:42:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie the mvp
[3:42:40] <%brachydios777> If Chief gets in smash the doors will be dust at that point
[3:42:41] <%DesertPenguin> How did Reggie and Woolie meet?
[3:42:41] <+Nothing_Wild> Between Chief and Slayer.
[3:42:43] <+mans51> I mean he was in all stars LUL
[3:42:44] <DatAsuna> Kratos was in soul calibur
[3:42:47] <%jorniev> MAY E NOW
[3:42:48] <+jiggy_snipe> cuz of allstars LUL
[3:42:51] <prime_name> Playstation All-Stars is already there

[3:43:01] <%DSD24> People are still gonna be pissed regardles they get in
[3:43:02] <TheChucklingOak> Kratos.... eh? maybe? I guess he would have a better moveset than FPS guys
[3:43:03] <+MarkUriah> Kratos - Soul Calibur - Link - Nintendo
[3:43:04] <Mr_Strut> Reggie was banned from tournaments for excessive showering
[3:43:09] <%KaitlynnHere> @woolieversus do you shave lil v? Cause if not I’m embarrassed by my amount of armpit hair compared to yours
[3:43:09] <prime_name> Wait, what?
