[0:24:52] <ZeeJiggle> Oh hell yeah, we gettin' SMOOTH
[0:24:53] <Jerp> punching an enemy mid-attack seems to have massive structure damage.  anyone able to confirm that?
[0:24:53] <%RyTYoung> Slick af
[0:24:54] <letshavecakes> The focus sweep is actually an entirely useless move
[0:24:56] <Pink_Bon> This game looks so sick, I really need to buy it

[0:25:11] <%RyTYoung> That sprinting heavy looks super handy, know what skill I’m unlocking next Kappa
[0:25:13] <Jerp> like, the gamble seems to be you want to break their structure or be able to block otherwise you get punished hard
[0:25:22] <majindusto> Woolie  determined  to Sweep
[0:25:23] <+mechslayer71> you could've finished her
[0:25:27] <Jerp> --- if you're punching into their attacks I mean
[0:25:29] <@Menitta> Are the glowing attacks not parry-able
[0:25:31] <jetstreamlove_R> He can see the frame data
[0:25:36] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:25:36] <velgaduere> shrine is a full heal
[0:25:38] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:25:38] <%RyTYoung> @jerp or you gotta avoid to get your structure bar back
[0:25:38] <DXLelouch24> @jetstreamlove_R not yet, he has MUCH MORE to learn to achieve Ultra Instinct in this game
[0:25:42] <Jerp> menitta they are, but the timing is a lot difference
[0:25:44] <DXLelouch24> first level is a joke comparatively
[0:25:45] <xerotwo> gotta get my points
[0:25:46] <+mechslayer71> but you didn't hit the optional fight upstairs tho
[0:25:50] <DXLelouch24> well second level too
[0:25:51] <NBUsagi> I appreciate when Woolie is in the zone
[0:25:52] <@Menitta> Ah that makes sense
[0:25:53] <+JustToWatch> she never gets an second life, you can do takedown on her
[0:25:57] <+mechslayer71> so it's not optimal actually
[0:26:00] <@Menitta> no wonder I kept missing it lol
[0:26:00] <letshavecakes> oof, not getting the parry damage unlocks on the first stage, horrendous build optimization
[0:26:04] <BlackermanZX> so is woolz doing the pat strat said in the podcast
[0:26:06] <Jerp> rytyoung: well I mean literally punching into them as counter-punches, similar to punchout.  seems you do more structure damage if you do, but you take the risk of getting hit
[0:26:27] <dds333a> @nbusagi we always give him shit, but it's good to see when he's actually playing well LUL
[0:26:29] <+mechslayer71> should've done these fights before shrine tbh
[0:26:43] <Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus did any of Pat's tips from the podcast come in handy yet?
[0:26:44] <Jerp> menitta: it sure seems like you deal more structure damage than normal if you parry glowing attacks though.  hard to tell while actually doing it
[0:26:53] <velgaduere> don't forget about throws
[0:26:56] <velgaduere> amazing for CC
[0:26:59] <%RyTYoung> @jerp I try to squeeze in a punch after every avoid to build up dazed quicker
[0:27:01] <skewerstar> So wait, you don't learn moves by parrying them over and over again huh? It's basically buying them at statues?
[0:27:11] <letshavecakes> There is also really no reason to fight these guys, they're harder than just doing the entire rest of the level without shortcuts
[0:27:19] <velgaduere> @skewerstar or when dying
[0:27:20] <dds333a> @skewerstar and purchasing them in the skill tree
[0:27:28] <@Menitta> Huh. I'll have to work on that timing
[0:27:37] <ZeeJiggle> @skewerstar Yea, we're not building our combos like in Absolver here.
[0:27:48] <Jerp> rytoung: i gotta start doing that - seems the game's very forgiving w/cancelling into avoids and parries
[0:27:55] <jubejube56> Yeah it’s unclear what is or isn’t parryable
[0:28:12] <%Juriasu> I love how focused Woolie is right now
[0:28:15] <jubejube56> I accidentally parried an attack from the third boss phase 1 which I thought was unparryable
[0:28:17] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:28:20] <dds333a> silhouetted LUL
[0:28:20] <jetstreamlove_R> 20 year is hard
[0:28:22] <Jerp> jube: seems everything high at the very least, and most weapons.  lows _seem_ parryable but it's hard to tell
[0:28:25] <+Ninjamaninjas> Some stuff is hard parry some is soft
[0:28:25] <pluswplus> everything but throws is parryable right?
[0:28:30] <letshavecakes> I miss Absolver's move learning, you'd think a game literally named after mastery would have something more complex than a handful of ye olde XP unlocks
[0:28:32] <BlackermanZX> beat the nerd
[0:28:34] <+mechslayer71> this guy only matters later
[0:28:36] <velgaduere> welp
[0:28:41] <pluswplus> you absolutely can parry lows as well
[0:28:45] <%RyTYoung> “Computers…and stuff Kappa”
[0:28:48] <Jerp> I've def parried every weapon except staffs, which maybe just have weird timing?
[0:28:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Barge into room, "I'm not looking for a fight", don't elaborate further, leave
[0:28:59] <thackattack00> Yeah there’s a special leg-kicking animation when you parry sweeps
[0:29:02] <velgaduere> computers and... stuff? like... STRUCTURE stuff??
[0:29:02] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:29:03] <ZeeJiggle> Everything but throws, ye. Some moves will just hurt your structure more.

[0:29:26] <+mechslayer71> @letshavecakes that would require npcs to have your moveset, and for them to be programmed to throw them out enough for you to learn
[0:29:27] <Jerp> zee: for glowing attacks I was getting like no structure loss - but had to be a perfect parry
[0:29:29] <+JayCWayC> "HI! Welcome to- "
[0:29:33] <+ALazo> why be peaceful when you can get so much hp
[0:29:35] <pluswplus> @cobalt_phoenix_ grab hitbox seems to come out at a weird timing. i just r2 dash out for throws usually

[0:30:04] <jubejube56> All in on the weapon build
[0:30:05] <SomeAsianDood> just cold cooking everyone
[0:30:07] <skewerstar> Nice, because Absolvers move learning system meant I spent hours parrying every single new move out of FOMO... the game never tells you if moves can be permanently missed...
[0:30:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @letshavecakes oh my god so it IS delayed fuck me, thanks
[0:30:10] <Jerp> what threw me off a lot was that you get a red flash on a perfect parry but not always structure break OR stun -- it's sort of like how parries work in unsighted/etc. where you might need more than one to get _any_ real result
[0:30:12] <%RyTYoung> WOW
[0:30:14] <letshavecakes> @mechslayer71 It doesn't have to be the same system, but they could do something more than a literal skill tree
[0:30:17] <%CavemanInCave> do weapons degrade?

[0:30:46] <%oneimportantthing> Man she has the same scream for every move and I can't stop focusing on it

[0:31:16] <Jerp> the elephant roar scream she does def stands out a lot relative to everything else.  could use a little extra variety with the VO there imo
[0:31:18] <pluswplus> @Jerp certain moves are "punishable" which means an avoid will slow time and a parry will deflect allowing for a big punish

[0:35:18] <emptyantics> Woolie flexing on us
[0:35:18] <CrimsonGargoyle> !motivated
[0:35:18] <@Moobot> @CrimsonGargoyle 2513 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:35:23] <Jerp> woolie's seeing some of that punchout-style "enemy's worn out" stagger
[0:35:25] <%CavemanInCave> absolver walked so this game could run tbh
[0:35:27] <jetstreamlove_R> He brought the stick this time!
[0:35:27] <NBUsagi> Bruh Woolie got that look in his eyes XD
[0:35:29] <skewerstar> eat shit Kilik
[0:35:33] <dds333a> POG dodging
[0:35:34] <+mechslayer71> so guys. is it me or are bat style weapons just like, way better than the others?
[0:35:36] <ripperoni7> this man is getting character developmented
[0:35:39] <iacus_> whoa nice run
[0:35:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @bromosap1ens I wouldn't do that if I were u
[0:35:40] <Jerp> there's definitely some sort of weird momentum meter that causes bosses to get off balance
[0:35:47] <%RyTYoung> Woolie got that furrowed brow, he means BIZNIZ
[0:35:47] <+MrMcCrabby> What was that about weak and feeble?
[0:35:47] <velgaduere> I take it Woolie doesn't know about the weapons in the first phase
[0:35:52] <jetstreamlove_R> there's Staff on the corner of this room too
[0:35:52] <Ashenik1> How long has the stream been on going ?
[0:35:52] <dds333a> @jerp got a star punch lined up
[0:35:53] <Jerp> it's not just their health or posture
[0:35:57] <emptyantics> This is just punch Sekiro
[0:36:01] <NBUsagi> Big homie is ZONED
[0:36:02] <%RyTYoung> ROUNDHOUSE KICK
[0:36:02] <+ZENKENmaster> alright alright
[0:36:04] <letshavecakes> @mechslayer71 the weapon use perk makes it so that staves turn into bats turn into throwing weapons through damage
[0:36:04] <%livlinn> t101AAA t101AAA t101AAA
[0:36:04] <+sevorai> He is LOCKED INNNN
[0:36:13] <+Tuffty> This is where the fun begins
[0:36:16] <dds333a> @ashenik1 pretty much started
[0:36:16] <%oneimportantthing> WOOLIE WAS JOHN SIFU ALL ALONG
[0:36:18] <Jerp> dds333a: yeah, it's like if you get enough counter punches in super punchout and the enemies fall apart
[0:36:20] <ZeeJiggle> Yeah, sometimes I'll get the bosses in like a dizzy state and can just wail on them for a bit.
[0:36:26] <Treasure_Vault> woolie at 12 heart beats per minute

[0:36:37] <BlackermanZX> NO TALKING
[0:36:37] <gunstars20> LUL
[0:36:40] <jubejube56> The second I learned in phase 2 that you can just block the first couple hits to never deal with the low this was so easy
[0:36:41] <ZeeJiggle> NO TALK. ONLY FIGHT
[0:36:43] <kadjah> @treasure_vault lol
[0:36:44] <thackattack00> @jerp I think that’s the dazed effect from being stunned multiple times
[0:36:51] <emptyantics> My only problem with the game is the voice acting is not great
[0:36:51] <NBUsagi> Woolzuto was Hokage all along
[0:36:52] <+OfficerMods> well the implication is that this guy burnt down old chinatown to make his fightclub
[0:37:06] <+MrMcCrabby> Ya boi got fire infusions

[0:37:07] <letshavecakes> The sweep is kind of irrelevant since ground counter fucks this dude so hard
[0:37:11] <+mechslayer71> @letshavecakes um, OK. no offense but I don't really think that had much to do with bats being better in combat. also that only works for like 1 or 2 hits

[0:37:17] <%RyTYoung> yeyeyeyeye
[0:37:19] <Jerp> thack: maybe?  guess it just takes way more work to get it on bosses, and most enemies are dead before you see it there
[0:37:21] <jetstreamlove_R> Woolie went to the Asura Wrath school of "Shut yo mouth and square up!"

[0:38:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie that was rad to watch
[0:39:02] <+crybirb> That looked good, but still waiting for him to try boss 3 (:
[0:39:03] <AvroEltz> And its gonna be all downhill from here
[0:39:06] <charrchord> did some off screen grinding
[0:39:08] <T_Sasquatch> @mechslayer71 no joke but yea they did
[0:39:09] <DXLelouch24> but NOW, Woolie shall be HUMBLED
[0:39:11] <letshavecakes> I'm excited for this, the museum is the best part of the game. Was so sad that Pat thought it'd be a good idea to do it off-stream
[0:39:15] <DXLelouch24> Museum dont play
[0:39:22] <dds333a> The GG Korean soundtrack
[0:39:24] <DXLelouch24> and lv 4 has no chill
[0:39:26] <+mechslayer71> @t_sasquatch oh boy, wonder if woolie knows that
[0:39:30] <%LastHazzerd> the sounds of my enemies falling is the only music i need
[0:39:33] <TigerClaws12> the dojo kitchen
[0:39:34] <%Shad0wTag> THE SMELL OFTHE GAME
[0:39:42] <+crybirb> Boss 4 is the easiest IMO
[0:39:44] <%WonderLandGhost> WonderLandGhost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Thanks for all the great streams!
[0:39:44] <DXLelouch24> wait they nerfed Sean? why?
[0:39:45] <letshavecakes> Grinding levels to Wu-Tang mixtapes is top tier
[0:39:45] <emptyantics> LV4 is harder thatn LVL5 imo
[0:39:45] <buffany> he can taste the structure
[0:39:52] <jetstreamlove_R> There was Staffs in the corner of the 1st phase but my man said "Fuck the Staffs"
[0:39:53] <DXLelouch24> guess i beat him pre nerf
[0:40:06] <Ashenik1> The King has returned!
[0:40:09] <+sevorai> Sean was the stop gap for peeps heavily
[0:40:20] <niffinbox> yeah sean got patched
[0:40:22] <SomeAsianDood> @dxlelouch24 people were dropping the game I think the devs said 27% of people got past stage 2 pre patch
[0:40:26] <+crybirb> Sean down attack was BS
[0:40:32] <TigerClaws12> bruh he's the easiest boss
[0:40:33] <+CookieCutter007> LUL Sean's sweeps are so bullshit
[0:40:39] <velgaduere> Sean phase 2 is an absolute bastard when he enrages
[0:40:41] <+Javaa01> Yeah he doesn't bait the neutral sweep as much
[0:40:43] <+Tuffty> Yeah for sure
[0:40:45] <zhenthrim213> his sweep got nerfeda bit
[0:40:46] <+crybirb> He is not the easiest, boss 4 is the easiest
[0:40:46] <%jinking79> damn Sean my fav boss too
[0:40:48] <DXLelouch24> if my autistic, asbergers, adhd ass can beta him pre nerf you can too. cant use disability excuse FUCKOS
[0:40:48] <T_Sasquatch> You did good Woolie i was just teasing
[0:40:48] <thebalticguy1> HE SPAMMED LOW SWEEP
[0:40:51] <Grim1952> Sean is super easy once you know the trick, he's meant to be a wall
[0:40:53] <DXLelouch24> beat*
[0:40:56] <AvroEltz> His sweeps are so fast, that was the problem
[0:40:57] <emptyantics> Yeah they nerfed all the bosses
[0:41:00] <+crybirb> His Low Sweep was so unfair, really quiclly and hard to react
[0:41:02] <hellhound123123> lame, why not just roll those sweeps into an easy mode
[0:41:10] <+mechslayer71> @emptyantics actually for real?
[0:41:10] <+JayCWayC> His Low sweep was damn near unreactble. but it wasn't that bad.
[0:41:15] <DXLelouch24> YAY i beat the game pre nerf
[0:41:17] <%RyTYoung> You did great Woolie!
[0:41:19] <+andGalactus1> they nerfed the bosses? Thank god.
[0:41:19] <DXLelouch24> yay me
[0:41:22] <skyshinecrusader> Way less jittery too
[0:41:22] <+crybirb> @emptyantics O hreally? They nerfed 3? Then its a bummer cuz she was hard but really doable.
[0:41:25] <hellhound123123> the low sweep was so predictable tho
[0:41:25] <%LastHazzerd> weighted clothing
[0:41:27] <DXLelouch24> good thing too
[0:41:27] <NBUsagi> Yeah Woolie you crushed him
[0:41:28] <Awesome_Leaf> is there a way to play pre nerf?
[0:41:31] <DXLelouch24> i dont want a handicap
[0:41:31] <hellhound123123> he only does one
[0:41:32] <+Ninjamaninjas> His sweeps were pretty rough took me back to my punch-out days
[0:41:36] <@Menitta> when did the nerf happen
[0:41:39] <%RyTYoung> I will be the game after the nerf and I will not feel bad whatsoever gigaboOtsAngyEvil
[0:41:40] <thebalticguy1> age locked at 29
[0:41:42] <+sevorai> sean is supposed to be the final lesson on dodging and the ones that were'nt passing him usually were brute forcing
[0:41:43] <%RyTYoung> Beat*
[0:41:44] <+mechslayer71> that's whack. letting the chumps squeeze through suprCHAD
[0:41:45] <kadjah> i too fear age
[0:41:46] <emptyantics> @mechslayer71 Yes they really did
[0:41:47] <+Javaa01> Yeah you're gonna age a bunch next stage
[0:41:48] <%Juriasu> there's alot of stuff in this game that is REALLY hard to react to for me, third boss is just walling me completely
[0:42:02] <Awesome_Leaf> 21 Pog
[0:42:10] <AvroEltz> If i'm not mistaken, if you get it now, you can still progress to a permanent upgrade even if you go past the max age
[0:42:18] <charrchord> DuckerZ strike
[0:42:35] <+crybirb> @Juriasu Third there are things you can learn to react. It takes a while tho, the first phase is ROOOUUUGH
[0:42:40] <NBUsagi> This game has mad replay value
[0:42:48] <dds333a> labbing phase
[0:42:49] <+hybridcode7> I wish I could off cam age down
[0:42:51] <+ArcanumArcanum> @Juriasu third boss I had to just keep my distance, wait for her to finish her combo, then rush in for some hits. the up-up-triangle attack is great for getting in
[0:42:55] <+mechslayer71> was it me, or did Sean also not back off mid combo nearly as much either?
[0:43:02] <%Xaeveax> Haven't managed to catch much of this series live, but I look forward to catching up on the anime later.
[0:43:06] <+crybirb> BTW this game is the proper evolution of Beat N Up, I want to see more of this with more fighting styles. Sadly this kind of combat is super expensive to make.
[0:43:11] <jubejube56> Looking it up they described the boss changes as bug fixes
[0:43:18] <%Juriasu> @Juriasu yeah I feel like she has like 5 different combos that are long strongs with different combinations of highs ans lows ans yeah it's rough
[0:43:20] <jubejube56> Maybe some of their behaviour was unintended
[0:43:21] <%RyTYoung> Aaaaahhhhh
[0:43:25] <%RyTYoung> That’s why it’s there
[0:43:34] <+mechslayer71> @emptyantics fucking lame. shit like this makes me glad hidetaka Miyazaki is pretty unyielding

[0:44:35] <DXLelouch24> bitch
[0:44:36] <velgaduere> Sean did seem pretty spammy. I wouldn't be surprised if that was being fixed as a result of being unintended
[0:44:37] <T_Sasquatch> If someone ever did a sweep to me Irl and actually got me down i would insta give up
[0:44:38] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:44:44] <dds333a> He makes it all look good

[0:45:11] <alexandrecau> love eastenr game where security carry baseball bats
[0:45:12] <Ashenik1> IRL I think you want as few punches as possible. Just the good ones.

[0:55:07] <Ashenik1> we only hire criminals; guard-exmob, accountant - raised in prison, janitor - terrorist from ''The troubles''

[0:55:40] <emptyantics> Just casually blocking blade slashes with your arm
[0:55:41] <Cha0ticSoul> ResidentSleeper
[0:55:45] <TigerClaws12> it's different per level
[0:55:46] <+Fabpsi_> we are indeed doing this

[0:55:50] <%Reveresao> structure?
[0:55:51] <velgaduere> gonna have to taunt more Keepo
[0:55:51] <+JustToWatch> yeah you want to get all 3 of those BEFORE this stage
[0:55:53] <Jerp> I'm wondering what happens if you carry a knife the entire way to a boss and then hit the boss with the charged knife
[0:55:55] <thebalticguy1> ITS DIFF PER LEVEL
[0:55:55] <letshavecakes> The hazards of doing unoptimal runs of earlier levels
[0:55:57] <skewerstar> isn't that kunai pendulum an actual thing IRL!?
[0:56:00] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus best to get that 2x in the first level or its EXPENSIVE
[0:56:02] <+OfficerMods> just play the game perfectly woolie
[0:56:07] <LoneFonte> @Reveresao sekiro posture
[0:56:07] <iacus_> yes those pendulums exist
[0:56:15] <+El_Rabbit> Just do good
[0:56:17] <+SammyOVision> Yeah you can get to 4k before the second shrine in the first stage if you play your cards right
[0:56:21] <letshavecakes> You can get two ranks in that with a good enough squats run
[0:56:27] <iacus_> bosses are probably protected against instakills
[0:56:35] <+Fabpsi_> bosses don't care
[0:56:36] <DXLelouch24> oh yea
[0:56:36] <+mechslayer71> @jerp no way it's a kill, right? that would be too easy
[0:56:40] <skyshinecrusader> The knife is better to go for eye gouge for easy stab
[0:56:46] <jetstreamlove_R> get into the art of DMC
[0:56:52] <Jerp> mechslayer71 maybe it's an easter egg and actually works
[0:56:52] <DXLelouch24> level 5 boss Will wreck your ass
[0:56:53] <+mace210> that first stab instakill was INSANE tho
[0:56:54] <+Fabpsi_> you also don't have to kill the bosses, there is a way to spare them iirc

[0:57:49] <MadBaller123> this is just a concussion simulator when it's not a murder simulator
[0:57:53] <iacus_> no deaths till now, just traumatic injuries
[0:57:53] <alexandrecau> drug den and fight club doesn't deserve bloodbath but the ART MUSEUM
[0:57:54] <jetstreamlove_R> Revenge requires intense MOTIVATION
[0:58:07] <skewerstar> So at what point does "The Door" from The Raid happen?
[0:58:13] <MinersLoveGames> You can totally go non-violent though, if you avoid the blades?
[0:58:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:58:28] <Seithri> its okay, you are doing the right thing, a frog told me so
[0:58:30] <%LastHazzerd> i think they've all been getting it, but people don't process internal blunt trauma the same as visible wounds.
[0:58:33] <dds333a> @skewerstar when protag gets chased by a bunch of machete men LUL
[0:58:36] <velgaduere> @MinersLoveGames I think your definition of "violent" might be different from most
[0:58:40] <+JayCWayC> oh god, not that.
[0:58:42] <karawra> oh noooo
[0:58:45] <jimgimp> Pretty sure most extras in martial arts film are actually almost if not perma fucked after they fight the protagonist anyways
[0:58:46] <+SammyOVision> Hmm, perhaps the art level is trying to make you think about the character's vengeance spiral... 🤔
[0:58:49] <%LastHazzerd> AH
[0:58:50] <+Fabpsi_> man, a artwork about twins must be hard. try to get the subtle differences and not just make 1 on 1 statues/paintings
[0:58:51] <Jerp> get further into that body world and look out the windows and ... it's pink? wait, everything's covered in pink
[0:58:52] <%jepupu> The artists had fun with this stage, I bet
[0:58:54] <%TreeLeafBoi> Me I'm a identical twin

[1:17:38] <+Ninjamaninjas> Read
[1:17:39] <ChristopherWPoindexter> apathy nagYep_HF it's nice to finally see actual footage of this game title I've seen a lot recently, and wow, the design of leveling, age, all that stuff is intriguing me already
[1:17:39] <velgaduere> @mace210 only 6/7 deep though
[1:17:40] <dds333a> @reallybigrocks Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:17:42] <zeebs838> Violence the Yoshi would be proud.
[1:17:43] <+Fabpsi_> go to your museum of your choice and do drugs, probably same effect
[1:17:43] <TheyCallMeVawn> This museum is tight

[1:18:00] <puluxor> oof majinoTears
[1:18:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> @DSD24 bold of you to think there's only one
[1:18:02] <dds333a> @dsd24 Limitless or Lucy Kappa
[1:18:05] <+scarman125> so are the people talking two different people or does the boss have multiple personalities?
[1:18:12] <letshavecakes> This level also has the most ridiculous shortcuts to make up for it
[1:18:20] <DSD24> @dds333a I was thinking Lucy actually, Limitless was cool
[1:18:20] <+SammyOVision> @scarman125 :)
[1:18:30] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @sammyovision :)
[1:18:32] <puluxor> I was expecting a Bruce Lee scream there
[1:18:36] <%LastHazzerd> this is a really cool level
[1:18:36] <%RyTYoung> Woolie’ll be amazed where the elevator takes you to
[1:18:38] <StormSamurai8> This is a cool part
[1:18:39] <DSD24> Art zone
[1:18:39] <dds333a> @dsd24 ayyy, my man

[1:19:01] <DSD24> This is a great Museum
[1:19:06] <majindusto> This Museum  is IMPOSSIBLE  SPACE
[1:19:07] <+OfficerMods> i sure hope you don't have some form of ocd woolie
[1:19:07] <%Juriasu> fucking up the art again smh
[1:19:10] <StormSamurai8> No my paper mache sculpture
[1:19:10] <@Solidus_113> rude
[1:19:11] <NBUsagi> Lol yeah i would be the same, fuck up everything
[1:19:11] <+Tizona824> Mannequin room
[1:19:12] <velgaduere> Woolie taking exactly 0 chances
[1:19:24] <+eternallytardy> the bg ambiance starting to sound like Fear Factory
[1:19:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:19:25] <+hybridcode7> her level is too cool for her to die
[1:19:26] <+tommy2mato> non-euclidean art exhibition
[1:19:26] <@Menitta> Another museum I like in games is the Air and Space Museum in Division 2 oddly enough
[1:19:33] <%Pillagius> is it basically shows you the boss moveset or something?
[1:19:42] <Cha0ticSoul> @WoolieVersus next time you level up new move at the bottom
[1:19:44] <buffany> imagine your job is to stand in this room all day and pretend to be a statue
[1:19:45] <DSD24> This is that one part in Condemned where the mannequins start attacking
[1:19:46] <StormSamurai8> @Pillagius no
[1:19:47] <ChristopherWPoindexter> that really seemed like a weird fall damage/fell out of bounds death...seems almost designed to surprise us for a split second-
[1:19:50] <%Reveresao> need more poise
[1:19:52] <thebalticguy1> KICK GIRLS AREWOOLIES KRYPTONITE
[1:19:53] <letshavecakes> Being bad at shadowboxing because you're a narcissist and think you could shatter anyone in one hit
[1:19:53] <%Juriasu> this stage really humbles you
[1:19:54] <sirrice77> @Menitta I feel like that mission went on too long but it's been a while
[1:19:57] <+Tizona824> Dirty 30s
[1:20:03] <Dakuu75> Imagine how stressful it is for the ONE real person standing there... listening to you break ALL the mannequins. lol
[1:20:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cmon woolie get that short-haired kickgirl
[1:20:12] <dds333a> Kick Girls>Punch Girls
[1:20:18] <jubejube56> Oh right we are almost at the roller derby of death
[1:20:19] <DSD24> The best years in this game is at 40 cause you get that rad jacket
[1:20:20] <+OfficerMods> vanessa
[1:20:23] <+OfficerMods> your argument is invalid
[1:20:25] <thebalticguy1> kick girls>punch girls
[1:20:28] <@Menitta> @sirrice77 I liked it because of how accurate it was and the mars exhibit bit was awesome
[1:20:34] <@Menitta> But that's fair
[1:20:37] <DSD24> Luong from KOF is a kicky lady and she's rad
[1:20:37] <skewerstar> Oh no... now you're a Christmas cake! no one will marry you!
[1:20:40] <+Mellowun> I had to learn how to block kick girls instead of dodge. My instincts fail me.
[1:20:42] <StormSamurai8> Poor Kuroki
[1:20:43] <NBUsagi> She killed her twin?
[1:20:43] <+scarman125> this is kinda hurting my eyes
[1:20:45] <+Tizona824> Think about wife. Regret.
[1:20:49] <%Pillagius> @Pillagius not the enemy, the statues. they have the moves the boss does
[1:20:50] <+mace210> its gonna end
[1:20:50] <dds333a> Woolie cannot defeat a kick girl, that's why he cant help but love Chie LUL
[1:20:53] <+sevorai> Wow those reds and blues are fucking up my eyes lmao
[1:20:54] <ChristopherWPoindexter> museums in video games, ooh...there's a wacky one in a famous SpongeBob game, a weird Atlantis one, there's the one in Grand Theft Auto 4 where a few overlapping missions take place....
[1:20:58] <TheyCallMeVawn> It be like that sometimes Woolie
[1:21:04] <DSD24> Fajar
[1:21:07] <%SirGO0SE> no sympy for the child murder
[1:21:14] <dds333a> They did
[1:21:15] <ChristopherWPoindexter> *Atlantis SpongeBob one,
[1:21:16] <Dakuu75> cowards
[1:21:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "but they were sad once too"
[1:21:18] <velgaduere> incredible
[1:21:20] <DSD24> So its still complicit but still bad
[1:21:25] <TheyCallMeVawn> Was Yangs decision to be fair
[1:21:26] <majindusto> Fuck  Fajar
[1:21:29] <henshin2289> We all ready for him to get WHAMBO COMBO’D 😂
[1:21:30] <Estuko> "I thought you died." "I got better."
[1:21:32] <outsidedoubtside> Yeah it was Plantman who unalived you as a kid, right?
[1:21:33] <+mechslayer71> and there's a bit of info you learn later about the botanist that makes a LOT of sense
[1:21:33] <ChristopherWPoindexter> now that is a quote to play out of context 🥴
[1:21:35] <NBUsagi> I mean nah these people are all shitty, but they are shitty people with depth
[1:21:37] <DSD24> I see a cool staf
[1:21:37] <+crybirb> Oh wow, they did nothing but felt bad about being complacent to child murder.
[1:21:43] <+rrratbastard> fajar's fine, fajar's cool, he grows plants
[1:21:44] <+crybirb> Nahhh, whatever they deserve it
[1:21:46] <+Fabpsi_> taunting statues
[1:21:48] <+Fabpsi_> lol
[1:21:49] <0078thunder> taunting a statue

[1:22:21] <+tommy2mato> kick women EX
[1:22:22] <%jepupu> Skates
[1:22:22] <DSD24> There was a weapon style that had blade feet
[1:22:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> KNIFE SHOES
[1:22:22] <AngryAsian5> Foot blades. That's what they're emphasizing LUL
[1:22:24] <emptyantics> RWBY YELLOW TRAILER
[1:22:25] <Cha0ticSoul> NotLikeThis
[1:22:25] <velgaduere> we're emphasizing ice skates
[1:22:25] <%Charronia> This is some powerful genjutsu
[1:22:26] <Jerp> one of those images looked so much like the windfall icon in high res
[1:22:27] <dds333a> Taunting gets better as you age, definitely

[1:22:39] <+Mellowun> block kickers. not dodge
[1:22:40] <letshavecakes> Yeah, aging takes your taunts through challenges and intimidation straight through to condescension and teaching
[1:22:41] <+sevorai> Kickers WITH foot blades
[1:22:42] <ChristopherWPoindexter> that training montages comment earlier is quite on point
[1:22:43] <dds333a> I know some elderly people that can tear you apart six ways to Sunday
[1:22:44] <Daxalog> Some guy on lights waiting for attacks to land to change the hues
[1:22:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck yea kick girls with KNIFE SHOES

[1:22:59] <ZeeJiggle> SLAP
[1:23:00] <+JustToWatch> "This piece of art really conveys getting kicked to death by foot blades"
[1:23:01] <NBUsagi> Only Punch Girls no Kick
[1:23:01] <jetstreamlove_R> This level is sick
[1:23:03] <+notgoodatnamessorry> you got that from the mask
[1:23:03] <%Juriasu> Calbot
[1:23:03] <LoneFonte> Calbot!
[1:23:04] <velgaduere> "Calbot"
[1:23:04] <MinersLoveGames> Woolie shuts down two girls to continue a fighting game once again...
[1:23:04] <DSD24> There is a really awesome older taunt that I don't want to spoil
[1:23:07] <+JayCWayC> You got that from the mask
[1:23:09] <Cha0ticSoul> @WoolieVersus from mask
[1:23:09] <peyodogo> this is the first i see of sifu and all im thinking about is that one ubisoft naruto game the old gang lp'd once
[1:23:12] <iacus_> wat
[1:23:12] <LoneFonte> that's from the mask?
[1:23:14] <DSD24> Absolver!

[1:23:14] <+MayLeFay> @mechslayer71 you still spoil stuff we don't don't know
[1:23:15] <%Juriasu> it's calbot!
[1:23:16] <+JustToWatch> Calbot
[1:23:19] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus mask gave it to you
[1:23:21] <DSD24> Its a Absolver Move
[1:23:21] <+tommy2mato> absolver easter egg
[1:23:22] <jetstreamlove_R> Woolie finally meet his match Kick Girls
[1:23:22] <+Fabpsi_> You got it after looking at the mask @WoolieVersus , it is a fun little extra
[1:23:23] <velgaduere> Calbot is Calbot, according to the video game
[1:23:23] <GunneryGoblin> Calbot is a Slap!
[1:23:23] <%RyTYoung> Oooooooo
[1:23:24] <+Pilau32> Its just disrespect
[1:23:24] <%jepupu> Super Taunt
[1:23:25] <iacus_> weird
[1:23:29] <niffinbox> absolver slap
[1:23:30] <LoneFonte> it was an secret absolver move
[1:23:33] <%SerialSins> Absolver taunt
[1:23:34] <+Fabpsi_> basically an easteregg fun taunt
[1:23:36] <a_bald_bro> It maxes your multiplier
[1:23:38] <majindusto> Kick Girls...The Only counter  to Punch  Girls
[1:23:38] <ZeeJiggle> So in Absolver, this was a super rare move that was just all BM.
[1:23:38] <jubejube56> It maxes your combo multiplyer
[1:23:41] <+crybirb> It's the Moonlight Blade of this studio
[1:23:41] <+Commander_Warthog> No damage, but gives you a multiplier
[1:23:42] <DSD24> Its pretty good actually
[1:23:44] <velgaduere> what if it's an ultra taunt that gives you HELLA point multiplier?
[1:23:44] <Jerp> Calbot is from Absolver - was rare and hard to get
[1:23:46] <Cha0ticSoul> max multiplyier
[1:23:46] <IzanagiNoOokami> Are you slappin?
[1:23:48] <ChristopherWPoindexter> "It Came From The Mask™️"
[1:23:55] <+thewellroundedgamer99> It’s a move from absolver
[1:23:57] <velgaduere> Noob Calbot
[1:24:01] <letshavecakes> 'british word' lmao
[1:24:02] <Estuko> @dds333a that grandparent strength with arms built like 5000year old oak tree lol
[1:24:05] <+Babooboomin> gives max multiplier
[1:24:06] <+Fabpsi_> Bots getting into the game, the revolution begins
[1:24:12] <Awesome_Leaf> get the slap LUL
[1:24:16] <%Juriasu> flowing calm is rad
[1:24:19] <dds333a> @officermods by the way, I forgot to mention earlier, I agree with you, Vanessa is WAY cooler
[1:24:39] <DSD24> You guys liking Vanessa's new design in KOF15?
[1:24:42] <%MajorCrasher> dude, if this game ever gets multiplayer duels it'd be the sickest
[1:24:43] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @letshavecakes nagYep_HF reminds me of Grand Theft Auto occasionally using British slang because of the writers, despite an almost always United States setting
[1:24:47] <@Menitta> like every word, it's made up
[1:24:50] <dds333a> @dsd24 I dig it
[1:25:01] <DSD24> I like the sandals but the pants I'm still undecided on
[1:25:06] <dds333a> @menitta LUL
[1:25:07] <skewerstar> all I'm getting is that it's a software company in Leeds...
[1:25:09] <T_Sasquatch> @majorcrasher literally Absolver
[1:25:12] <%LastHazzerd> oh they got blade shoes
[1:25:19] <+Fabpsi_> daaaaamn
[1:25:21] <DSD24> YES
[1:25:22] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @dsd24 @dds333a usernames are similar...that's a neat coincidence
[1:25:22] <AvroEltz> AXE KICK
[1:25:23] <Cha0ticSoul> NotLikeThis
[1:25:25] <DSD24> Cool jacket time
[1:25:27] <%SirGO0SE> hey @Menitta jc if you had issues setting up the queue
[1:25:28] <Awesome_Leaf> BANSAIII
[1:25:30] <+mace210> we 40 now
[1:25:33] <+mechslayer71> the ground counter stops the axe kicks btw
[1:25:34] <thebalticguy1> Reggies type of girls
[1:25:40] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @menitta technically true 🥴
[1:25:40] <+austinj24> new drip acquired.
[1:25:43] <T_Sasquatch> Absolver failed because it was a pvp game with shit pve and they didn't market it as sych
[1:25:43] <%MajorCrasher> @t_sasquatch yeah but I like this better tho lol
[1:25:45] <+Fabpsi_> maybe not learn
[1:25:47] <ZeeJiggle> Best fashion age.

[1:25:49] <dds333a> @thebalticguy1 the eternal oppposited
[1:25:56] <DSD24> @T_Sasquatch Also it needed more support
[1:26:02] <letshavecakes> I looked away for a minute and now woolie is 41 lmao
[1:26:02] <Estuko> from what I learned about Calbot deck in absolver is the extreme disrespect it delivers
[1:26:03] <+crybirb> Got the shortest shortcut
[1:26:04] <+Tizona824> The one way to improve on the axe kick, add an axe head
[1:26:04] <%Pillagius> How many times Woolie received a "Footality" ?
[1:26:05] <dds333a> Reg likes kick girls, and Woolie punch girls LUL
[1:26:07] <NBUsagi> Lol Woolie
[1:26:11] <DSD24> Look at this jacket

[1:26:32] <+crybirb> Did she get the Jacket just by aging? Is that a bug?
[1:26:42] <+crybirb> My character never changed clothes when getting older
[1:26:42] <Estuko> aging
[1:26:43] <+sevorai> outfit changes as you age
[1:26:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @crybirb yes, no

[1:28:20] <+crybirb> @DSD24, I may be dreaming but I remember aging till 70 and kept the 20's clothing until I beat the boss. Not sure now.
[1:28:21] <dds333a> @nbusagi the Artist indeed LUL
[1:28:22] <+mechslayer71> @dsd24 hair changes a bit and face ages a bit, but yeah, same outfit

[1:28:41] <NBUsagi> @dds333a straight up
[1:28:42] <SomeDudeDrawing> I feel like they made her a bit easier after the Patch
[1:28:43] <dds333a> sectioned staff
[1:28:47] <DSD24> @mechslayer71 That's what I forget to mention appreciate it
[1:28:50] <Cha0ticSoul> don't forget the tutorial tip with the back forward push
[1:28:50] <+Tizona824> @ballerswagbro9k Segmented staff
[1:28:52] <+crybirb> @BallerSwagBro9k, according to Matt, Nagitama
[1:28:58] <+sevorai> I really like the 50s outfit
[1:28:58] <%SirGO0SE> @BallerSwagBro9k sansetsukon
[1:29:00] <+Ninjamaninjas> She got the mixups alright
[1:29:00] <dds333a> @crybirb LUL LUL
[1:29:01] <DSD24> This looks like a three section staff
[1:29:02] <spokensun> mixups!
[1:29:02] <Grim1952> Parrying is easier than dodging for this boss
[1:29:02] <emptyantics> @somedudedrawing They nerfed everyone
[1:29:05] <@Solidus_113> spin2win
[1:29:06] <jetstreamlove_R> This boss doesn't like you attacking first
[1:29:06] <letshavecakes> three-section staff is so cool but I feel like I never see it in anything
[1:29:09] <BlackermanZX> damn
[1:29:11] <skyshinecrusader> flippin n dippin

[1:29:25] <+OfficerMods> letshavecakes watch some shaw bros
[1:29:26] <%Juriasu> I still don't know how you're supposed to react fast enough to know which combo she's doing even if you learn the sequence you need to dodge
[1:29:30] <DSD24> @letshavecakes It was in the movie Fearless and it was dope
[1:29:30] <Seithri> three sectiohned staff is hard to use without slapping yourself
[1:29:33] <+Tizona824> @letshavecakes It got repped in dmc5
[1:29:42] <+Mellowun> Yo, if you figure out her patterns, You Are Amazing. I couldn't. I had to time my blocks.
[1:29:45] <velgaduere> nice combo
[1:29:51] <DSD24> Jackets getting longer
[1:29:54] <SomeDudeDrawing> That's good to know,     I already 100% the game before the patch XD @emptyantics

[1:30:06] <ChristopherWPoindexter> nagYep_HF
[1:30:06] <NBUsagi> So what happens when you run out of coins?
[1:30:07] <jetstreamlove_R> She is known as the hardest boss outside of the final one
[1:30:09] <skewerstar> C'mon Woolie, use that Millia matchup mixup knowledge!
[1:30:11] <dds333a> This is still labbing
[1:30:13] <+Fabpsi_> maaaaybe a quick look at the 2nd stage
[1:30:14] <+crybirb> Woolie gets angry at Reggie trying to make commentary hahahaha

[1:32:18] <Awesome_Leaf> pog shortcut
[1:32:19] <Dakuu75> @WoolieVersus that'd make a great emote
[1:32:19] <DSD24> You lose out on so much shrines
[1:32:21] <%Lion_kun> So even though Woolie died in the museum, he doesn't have to start from the squats?
[1:32:24] <+notgoodatnamessorry> this level is the most interesting one in terms of levels the you can take
[1:32:25] <+CheyMix> @DSD24 you must love pain
[1:32:27] <$lumporr> god damn is this so fucking stylish
[1:32:33] <+Bitscreed> oof
[1:32:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:32:33] <+crybirb> @DSD24, it's good to lab the bosses, but your definitive run should always be the full shrines
[1:32:34] <Awesome_Leaf> get chunked damn
[1:32:37] <DSD24> @CheyMix Gotta perfect the whole level!
[1:32:38] <+rrratbastard> @Lion_kun he can start any stage at the youngest age he arrived at that stage
[1:32:39] <+notgoodatnamessorry> *level paths
[1:32:42] <Cha0ticSoul> OOF
[1:32:43] <+mechslayer71> shortcut from here goes straight to boss
[1:32:43] <letshavecakes> @Lion_kun It's not a roguelike, it just has some similar mechanics
[1:32:44] <BlackermanZX> ouch bad start
[1:32:45] <Awesome_Leaf> give up lol
[1:32:46] <a_bald_bro> @Lion_kun You start from the level you got to at the lowest age you reach it
[1:32:47] <dds333a> TING
[1:32:49] <NBUsagi> OOFT dont start sloppy

[1:33:00] <@Solidus_113> reset

[1:33:15] <+mechslayer71> it's not a big deal
[1:33:16] <%Lion_kun> So is there any incentive to replay stages other than grinding for moves?

[1:33:16] <+Fabpsi_> https://clips.twitch.tv/SpicyKathishLEDStoneLightning-ts3G69t1Q6KCLeZq never forgetti
[1:33:17] <+sevorai> ???
[1:33:23] <DSD24> @crybirb That I get though, I just like playing the leveles
[1:33:25] <AstrodropGaming> Reset the bracket
[1:33:31] <jetstreamlove_R> That boss got Woolie woozie!
[1:33:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:33] <DaBelovedUnderdog> The path is second floor exhibition hall, fouth floor and then elevator to get all shrines
[1:33:35] <luftraumm1> perfect fight
[1:33:36] <+Fabpsi_> yikes, that 1 hurt
[1:33:37] <velgaduere> @JustToWatch says a lot that I already have that person blocked LUL
[1:33:49] <dds333a> @lion_kun sometimes there are collectibles, if one cares
[1:33:55] <+JustToWatch> @mechslayer71 you realize you're the type of person Woolie genuinely hates right?
[1:33:59] <DSD24> zero
[1:34:03] <DSD24> Well actually 1
[1:34:07] <+MooseIsGoose> It looks like you will get just 1
[1:34:17] <DSD24> But you miss out on so much exp
[1:34:18] <+Mcmoblin> They know she is hard
[1:34:23] <dds333a> Replaying stages also helps for just general practice
[1:34:24] <henshin2289> @justtowatch that’s not a spoiler that’s info he already knows after getting the key
[1:34:26] <+Ninjamaninjas> It knows you want the rematch
[1:34:26] <+mechslayer71> @justtowatch okay. he wouldn't be friends with pat if that were the case but okay
[1:34:31] <velgaduere> @JustToWatch looking at that reply thread, I recommend you do the same as I did
[1:34:32] <+Babooboomin> perfect for a lab
[1:34:34] <spokensun> but miss 2 shrines
[1:34:39] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @velgaduere 🤭💀
[1:34:41] <+sevorai> well couldn't you spam that 1 shrine and farm those bonuses?
[1:34:45] <+Fabpsi_> lab shortcut activated
[1:34:46] <DSD24> I like this boss theme
[1:34:51] <letshavecakes> Best path through the level is to just skip the first shrine and go straight to the fourth floor for second, then elevator to boss
[1:34:53] <%LastHazzerd> oh you can learn the fight this way
[1:34:56] <ChristopherWPoindexter> oh wait, already back to this part? woah
[1:34:57] <%Lion_kun> You can just run to the boss? lol
[1:35:01] <Cha0ticSoul> @Fabpsi_ LUL LUL
[1:35:02] <%LastHazzerd> that's super nice
[1:35:06] <SomeAsianDood> lab time Pog
[1:35:08] <+Mellowun> a weapon to block with just changed the game!
[1:35:09] <dds333a> @christopherwpoindexter that's the shortcut, yeah
[1:35:11] <+mace210> huge string
[1:35:13] <leith_aziz> 1, 2, 3, 4... pickyFocus
[1:35:16] <+mechslayer71> @sevorai they don't stack across multiple runs of a level. so he'd just get the same one over and over
[1:35:18] <+rrratbastard> @sevorai are you talking about using oine shrine for multiple upgrades? cause you can only get one shrine upgrade per shrine
[1:35:21] <Divryne> They fucking knew this was a lab boss lol.
[1:35:23] <iacus_> wait I missed how he got there so quickly
[1:35:23] <+MooseIsGoose> Are you able to interrupt the swings at all
[1:35:25] <DSD24> I love that spin kick
[1:35:26] <dds333a> SHE DOING STRINGS
[1:35:29] <+JustToWatch> @velgaduere you're right, it's not my job to be a mod
[1:35:31] <NBUsagi> Ok this game is way more forgiving than i thought it would be, i may give it a shot
[1:35:31] <+rrratbastard> @iacus_ unlocked shortcut via elevator
[1:35:33] <0078thunder> @letshavecakes the first shrine really isnt that bad either
[1:35:37] <%LastHazzerd> this is such a cool weapon
[1:35:37] <+Fabpsi_> @iacus_ seems like the elevator gets him directly to the boss
[1:35:39] <letshavecakes> If only you could disarm bosses and use their weapons
[1:35:42] <iacus_> wow, so you can basically skip the whole level
[1:35:47] <velgaduere> @JustToWatch agreed, though my point is more just to save your own sanity
[1:35:48] <jubejube56> With this boss I feel like she will do more sequences if you don’t weave them
[1:35:49] <henshin2289> @dds333a  😂🤣
[1:35:54] <%LastHazzerd> off the crunch
[1:35:57] <+rrratbastard> for this boss i needed it so lmao, i was thankful for it
[1:35:57] <+Mcmoblin> high low low high low
[1:35:58] <%Lion_kun> Do you miss out on anything if you just run to the boss? Are you much weaker or something?
[1:36:01] <DSD24> You can skip that first room and still get that first shrine
[1:36:02] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @dds333a 😐 ah, okay, i figured as much, since it was mentioned somewhere already
[1:36:03] <+sevorai> @sevorai meant more like each run, but i realize they dont perma unlock like the skills do
[1:36:12] <jetstreamlove_R> Biggest level whit the biggest shortcut, speedrunners wet dream
[1:36:14] <dds333a> @lion_kun shrines for upgrades
[1:36:14] <+Fabpsi_> the disrespect. throwing garbage at her
[1:36:16] <velgaduere> @JustToWatch "trying to mod" without mod powers is just feeding the trolls and taking mental damage for no good reasons
[1:36:19] <DSD24> @Lion_kun You don't get as many shrines for upgrades or exp
[1:36:28] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Lion_kun on this level you miss out on the max number of shrines possible
[1:36:29] <bustahwuulf> Wait, how'd he get here so fast?
[1:36:30] <letshavecakes> Honestly if you're good enough the shrines are only a marginal benefit
[1:36:31] <+Mcmoblin> there is also low high pause low high
[1:36:37] <DSD24> So like people said its a good shortcut for practicing the boss
[1:36:37] <%jepupu> Cool moves
[1:36:44] <+Mcmoblin> shortcut @bustahwuulf
[1:36:47] <velgaduere> they knew what kind of boss fight they created
[1:36:51] <dds333a> True. shrines aren't STRICTLY necessary, either
[1:36:55] <bustahwuulf> The shorcut is THAT huge?
[1:37:00] <teflonbilly777> Damn, I haven't gotten to her yet
[1:37:02] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @justtowatch i had to realize that recently, too @velagaduere all fax, no printer, plus what are the odds we'll actually help, change, or educate them? So yeah, truly not worth it sometimes.
[1:37:07] <+MooseIsGoose> @jetstreamlove_R I do want to see how the speed runners develop this game it looks interesting
[1:37:08] <%Lion_kun> If you manage to beat her, who cares though?
[1:37:08] <+Mcmoblin> takes you right there @bustahwuulf yup
[1:37:09] <Cha0ticSoul> Yo can interrupt with the palm push
[1:37:10] <letshavecakes> Wait, did woolie ever learn that he can avoid sweeps?
[1:37:10] <dds333a> If the player is confident, then go for it
[1:37:14] <Dakuu75> We should be so lucky, to get shortcuts like this in Elden Ring
[1:37:14] <+JustToWatch> @velgaduere I wouldn't go that far but you're right that it's a waste of ttime
[1:37:27] <DSD24> You can sway her moves as well
[1:37:28] <%LastHazzerd> i like that this game has both grinding and get gud
[1:37:31] <teflonbilly777> Man, that weapon is vicious
[1:37:37] <DSD24> Kuroki yes
[1:37:41] <velgaduere> @JustToWatch my point with that is that they want reactions
[1:37:48] <DTGL_Bhagavan> High dodge is best friend
[1:37:48] <ChristopherWPoindexter> this seems like...an improvement? nagPause_HF nihmunHypernums tobsWiggly
[1:37:49] <NBUsagi> @LastHazzerd Yeah it feels difficult but not like its trying to punish you, it wants you to learn
[1:37:50] <+SammyOVision> It at least makes it possible to unlock the next stage at a low age
[1:38:01] <jetstreamlove_R> Girl likes to dance!
[1:38:02] <velgaduere> @ChristopherWPoindexter especially when they say "I really don't give a fuck [about what the streamer wants] dude"
[1:38:08] <+sevorai> i think he's died as much as he did previous round, just is younger
[1:38:08] <DSD24> There is a trophy to beat the game at 25
[1:38:09] <+Mcmoblin> The vertical swipe is VERY LATE
[1:38:17] <OblivionSword1> overhead you can dodge as high

[1:39:10] <%Miles_Hikari> Ah a classic split personality with an artistic switch. I like
[1:39:10] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @velgaduere oh, true, there's wanting to avoid that issue, also, no kidding! not to go off topic, when people say that...it feels like projecting denial, and like something that can only be said in third person, bragging about it implies that there is care, if very little
[1:39:11] <letshavecakes> Does woolie have catch?

[1:39:36] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus And this where it becomes kinda vital to have the projectile catch unlocked
[1:39:37] <%CavemanInCave> fr lol
[1:39:37] <%Juriasu> strand means beach
[1:39:39] <Cha0ticSoul> Weapon catch!
[1:39:40] <%LastHazzerd> the visuals in this game are GREAT
[1:39:40] <+sevorai> you can CATCH THEM
[1:39:43] <+sevorai> ???
[1:39:43] <+Fabpsi_> @Menitta in case you missed it - he used the elevator as a shortcut. and if you mean the 2nd phase: oh yea, that was quickly
[1:39:43] <+rrratbastard> shit i'd go evil too if i could look this good doing it
[1:39:46] <+SammyOVision> Weapon catch is disgusting in this fight, infinite free knives.
[1:39:48] <@Menitta> What age is he at? I haven't been able to pay the most attention
[1:39:51] <%SirGO0SE> @rrratbastard samd
[1:39:52] <+Jiggisnipe> fucking zoners Kappa
[1:39:52] <alexandrecau> he beach
[1:39:53] <@Menitta> ooooh ok
[1:39:55] <DSD24> 40
[1:39:56] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @justtowatch ah, maybe, seems rare, but finding intentions is also incredibly painful and difficult online nihmunSus
[1:39:59] <jetstreamlove_R> She entered anime mode!
[1:40:00] <@Menitta> Ah that lol
[1:40:00] <Hexer_The_Hacker> I didn’t know Sifu was a Strand game
[1:40:01] <+rafaelba93> let her come to you, keep your distance
[1:40:02] <DSD24> We got the nice jacket back
[1:40:04] <teflonbilly777> Menopause activated
[1:40:06] <letshavecakes> That drop kick comes out late, this phase is basically free woolie come on
[1:40:09] <MinersLoveGames> MILF age activate.
[1:40:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> She's not that Fragile
[1:40:09] <Cha0ticSoul> stinger
[1:40:13] <+Undenizen> interesting how the crazy persona is all about water
[1:40:16] <+Fabpsi_> "you die now" - *dies* WELL, case closed
[1:40:23] <velgaduere> @JustToWatch "I don't give a fuck" seems pretty definitively closed off to me. I don't believe there can be any sort of learning moment in this kind environment, personally. not without the threat of discipline
[1:40:23] <%SirGO0SE> tsundere mode activate
[1:40:27] <jetstreamlove_R> Kurama is blushing from the heavens right now
[1:40:30] <%Double_Tap_That> We believe in you tho
[1:40:32] <teflonbilly777> Goth Asuka mode
[1:40:32] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[1:40:34] <AngryAsian5> You got to the second stage pretty quick
[1:40:40] <+mechslayer71> @letshavecakes tbf the second phase is just figuring what works, then flexing on her
[1:40:46] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus her second phase is pretty easy so you might actually do it on camera
[1:40:46] <%LastHazzerd> shirtless in the rain
[1:40:53] <+Fabpsi_> seems like you can block more of her stuff, but not those kunais
[1:40:55] <DSD24> That's also shades of the Stranger in God of war
[1:40:56] <%SirGO0SE> oh wait thats yandere right not tsundere LUL
[1:40:56] <luftraumm1> @WoolieVersus no shit you should get mihn to edit a video of you doing it perfectly eventually
[1:40:57] <jetstreamlove_R> Tip: Don't get stabbed LUL
[1:40:59] <+SirSnowman88> every single one of this person's moves can be side avoided in the second stage
[1:41:01] <dds333a> It's like how Ludwif Phase 2 is substantially easier
[1:41:17] <velgaduere> that combo is too good
[1:41:20] <letshavecakes> Woolie totally didn't buy the weapon catch
[1:41:23] <DSD24> This stage music is good too
[1:41:24] <+Babooboomin> dodge for parry throwing knives
[1:41:26] <+Fabpsi_> niiice combo
[1:41:28] <+Mcmoblin> Niiiice
[1:41:29] <+Babooboomin> or
[1:41:30] <+JustToWatch> @velgaduere idk, saying that you don't actually care when you really do just to hide it is pretty common
[1:41:33] <dds333a> the interrupt
[1:41:38] <+austinj24> HES BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
[1:41:40] <jubejube56> Yeah the kunai’s deal chip for whatever reason
[1:41:45] <%LastHazzerd> that was a good flow tho
[1:41:48] <OtakuSnake1> I think you're underestimating yourself. You have the fundamentals down and this second phase isn't as strong
[1:41:51] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @velgaduere very true, also that phrase just seems contradictory to even say out loud about oneself, like, even acknowledging it is a small amount of "caring." @justtowatch 💯 Seems like it!
[1:41:52] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Have more faith in yourself Woolz, you're doing great
[1:41:53] <letshavecakes> All weapons deal chip unless you have a weapon
[1:41:54] <%LastHazzerd> @jubejube56 blades
[1:42:01] <+Commander_Warthog> He sees the numbers!
[1:42:04] <bustahwuulf> @jubejube56 cause they are KUNAI HITTING SKIN lmao
[1:42:05] <%DaRoosta89> less is more definitely here
[1:42:08] <+Ninjamaninjas> All bladed weapons deal chip lol
[1:42:10] <+Jiggisnipe> zoners D:
[1:42:11] <+JayCWayC> Woolie "I wont get to it on this stream" Madden
[1:42:14] <dds333a> @jubejube56 stands to reason, no?
[1:42:15] <DSD24> Death
[1:42:16] <Cha0ticSoul> yeyeye
[1:42:16] <velgaduere> @JustToWatch in other contexts, I agree, but that person read "unreachable" to me
[1:42:17] <%Juriasu> good job
[1:42:18] <+Fabpsi_> niiice
[1:42:21] <karawra> cool
[1:42:22] <teflonbilly777> STABBO
[1:42:23] <+Mcmoblin> Finished but at 53
[1:42:23] <Cha0ticSoul> woolieEVIL woolieEVIL woolieEVIL
[1:42:25] <+austinj24> GG
[1:42:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LET'S GOOOOOOOO
[1:42:27] <ChristopherWPoindexter> no kidding about the death stranding aesthetics and energy here, very slightly
[1:42:27] <%LastHazzerd> Reversal
[1:42:28] <+TheOlMitcheroo> First try, let's go
[1:42:29] <0078thunder> every bosses 2nd phase is easier besides the 2nd boss
[1:42:32] <%Vertlos> yeaaah
[1:42:33] <%CavemanInCave> 2 shot ez
[1:42:33] <+mechslayer71> yeah he was never not gonna get it, he's just old
[1:42:36] <OneSassyMoogle> The idea of her running full speed into your eye-poke is hilarious to me kupo
[1:42:38] <teflonbilly777> She should've made an ahegao face there
[1:42:41] <+MooseIsGoose> Dang first try second phase
[1:42:44] <AngryAsian5> Nice
[1:42:44] <%SirGO0SE> right in the titter
[1:42:44] <jubejube56> Yet we can parry blades and they don’t deal chip
[1:42:45] <wandelmilch> Oren in the snow
[1:42:45] <cthulewd> she got lucy lu'd
[1:42:47] <alexandrecau> a hanzo blade
[1:42:48] <%illicitdonut> snow blood
[1:42:49] <letshavecakes> This is about the age that I managed to finish the museum for the first time
[1:42:49] <DSD24> Turned you into one of your modern art pieces
[1:42:53] <jubejube56> And mystical red attacks deal chip
[1:42:56] <dds333a> blood on the snow
[1:42:56] <+crybirb> Woolie did grea tjesus, I took 20+ tries
[1:42:56] <+TheFrancix> does woolie know that you can spare bosses?
[1:42:57] <+Undenizen> YO
[1:42:57] <MinersLoveGames> Blood on the snow.
[1:42:58] <AngryAsian5> Now just redo it and ace the mission LUL
[1:43:04] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @velgaduere There sure are a lot of unreachable moments and interactions online, no cap, the more I think about it. :(
[1:43:08] <%Juriasu> yeah it really is
[1:43:08] <+mechslayer71> it is
[1:43:09] <+crybirb> @TheFrancix, yeah
[1:43:09] <DSD24> Yeah the lady protag ages great
[1:43:10] <SomeAsianDood> yes
[1:43:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah it is
[1:43:11] <+rafaelba93> it is
[1:43:11] <+Ninjamaninjas> everyone does
[1:43:12] <+Fabpsi_> yup, better to block and read
[1:43:13] <%pi_in_the_sci> most people do
[1:43:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mommy
[1:43:13] <AngryAsian5> Pretty much
[1:43:14] <%SirGO0SE> @TheFrancix ya pat said on the podcast
[1:43:15] <AvroEltz> OH YEAH, 10x easier
[1:43:16] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Oh it's SOOO much easier
[1:43:17] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:43:17] <+Javaa01> Yeah, the second phase is the easy one
[1:43:17] <%Double_Tap_That> A lot of people agree
[1:43:17] <jetstreamlove_R> But she refused to Change
[1:43:19] <+Deosier> lab closed
[1:43:19] <+ValHollaYoloson> It totally is
[1:43:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> short day in the lab
[1:43:22] <robert_orri> it is, even easier if you catch her knives
[1:43:22] <+Jiggisnipe> short lab session
[1:43:22] <alexandrecau> lab close
[1:43:24] <thackattack00> It’s totally way easier
[1:43:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:43:27] <dds333a> until next time
[1:43:30] <+Javaa01> And it only gets easier when you permanently unlock projectile catch
[1:43:30] <Cha0ticSoul> Pat had the same experience
[1:43:35] <ChristopherWPoindexter> nagPause_HF
[1:43:36] <%jinking79> range characters r tough
[1:43:36] <%Lion_kun> So if Woolie progresses to the next stage, will he be stuck at 53
[1:43:37] <+Fabpsi_> we just need a bigger "LAB CLOSED" sign tbh
[1:43:44] <Vertigheist> @teflonbilly777 cmonBruh
[1:43:44] <+JustToWatch> yeah you're gonna want to cut that down by a LOT
[1:43:46] <emptyantics> Pre nerf she was a nightmare
[1:43:47] <%Lion_kun> Or can he redo the museum at 21
[1:43:48] <dds333a> @fabpsi_ LUL
[1:43:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the thing about 1st phase for me is knowing when it wants you do dodge. is is when the blade starts, when the blade is in motion, or what?
[1:43:51] <+crybirb> I think they made her lifebar smaller. She was so hard.
[1:43:52] <+Undenizen> fuck off that's 53. that's a 30 year old in a wig.
[1:43:52] <letshavecakes> Do other opponents not have two limbs?
[1:43:52] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @fabpsi_ nihmunKek
[1:43:54] <teflonbilly777> @Lion_kun Yes, but he can go back to the museum and start at 21
[1:43:57] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus you can also hit up another statue for basically free before taking the elevator
[1:44:08] <+JayCWayC> She was a run killer for a lot people.
[1:44:11] <letshavecakes> @Undenizen Yes it's called an asian woman
[1:44:12] <jetstreamlove_R> Get them perma upgrades
[1:44:17] <jetstreamlove_R> LUL
[1:44:18] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @undenizen tobsHeh
[1:44:19] <+SammyOVision> It's your dads old dojo I think still.
[1:44:22] <+rrratbastard> the upstairs is where sifu 2's gonna take place
[1:44:22] <DSD24> Asian ladies age like this
[1:44:24] <buffany> it once had more people
[1:44:24] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> it is the same school
[1:44:24] <AvroEltz> It is
[1:44:25] <+Fabpsi_> it is
[1:44:25] <bigshedman> She shoulda just dropped her revenge-quest and sold her real estate for crazy money Kappa
[1:44:26] <+JustToWatch> @Lion_kun yeah, but it doesn't matter because when he does the museum better it will reset
[1:44:27] <AnnoyedApricot> it is
[1:44:30] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> the tree is where your dad died
[1:44:32] <+Javaa01> It is the exact same building
[1:44:35] <SomeAsianDood> it is
[1:44:38] <thackattack00> It is
[1:44:39] <BlackermanZX> its been like 60 years
[1:44:39] <teflonbilly777> I wonder if the dad is buried where the tree is
[1:44:41] <%Lion_kun> Is it worth it to do a full run because it just seems like a big risk.
[1:44:41] <+mechslayer71> yeah it's the school
[1:44:45] <spokensun> the tree is granpa probably lol
[1:44:49] <+Tizona824> Ming-Na Wen is like 58 and she looks great
[1:44:50] <+Jiggisnipe> magic maybe
[1:44:51] <buffany> and if you look right here, this is where 7 children were killed
[1:44:53] <+crybirb> People who say all asian woman age like this never met many asian people =P
[1:44:55] <dds333a> The gameplay loop in my experience is always run it raw, unlock the shortcuts, then grind them out until the onseshot
[1:44:55] <+mechslayer71> just parts of it were locked off. the tree is where father died
[1:44:57] <jetstreamlove_R> We in the dojo of the tutorial
[1:44:57] <ChristopherWPoindexter> @letshavecakes nagMonkas nagYep_HF @dsd24 nihmunCreeping nihmunErb
[1:45:07] <+Fabpsi_> you even still got your hiding closet you were in when your Dad died. Remember? Remember the death of your father? dude, your dad died right there were the tree is now *painfully flashbacks intensifies*
[1:45:09] <%Lion_kun> It seems safer to ace each stage at a young age for the next stage.
[1:45:10] <ChristopherWPoindexter> seems like it, though
[1:45:13] <+JustToWatch> looks different without all the dead students
[1:45:23] <SomeAsianDood> the biggest difference is the tree. which is growing where your dad died
[1:45:30] <Grim1952> Weapon catch is great for 3rd boss
[1:45:31] <+mechslayer71> yeah off screen weapon throws suck ass
[1:45:33] <teflonbilly777> Asuka in WWE is 40 which blows my mind. She's a mom too
[1:45:38] <zzNamttamzz> Weapon catch is helpful in the boss
[1:45:39] <+SammyOVision> You can go back to the club to open that code door.
[1:45:46] <skyshinecrusader> yup
[1:45:47] <%Double_Tap_That> Weapon catch is really cool in the second phase of that fight.
[1:45:52] <dds333a> We got one this stream, or more
[1:45:52] <bigshedman> @teflonbilly777 She's fucking 40?!
[1:45:53] <letshavecakes> Weapon catch works on every kunai
[1:45:55] <ChristopherWPoindexter> nihmunHeart
[1:46:02] <+Javaa01> They are all absolutely catchable, but yeah, the straight single throws have a max range
[1:46:05] <Dakuu75> is there chip, when you block?
[1:46:15] <+Javaa01> So she can't meaty you across the stage
[1:46:17] <+Shoryo_Tori> You can catch all of her kunai
[1:46:19] <dds333a> @dakuu75 on sharp things, yeah
[1:46:26] <DSD24> The tower is a sick level
[1:46:32] <TheSaltminer> @Dakuu75 with blades, yeah

[1:46:43] <teflonbilly777> @bigshedman it's wild. Especially when you consider how long and rough her career in Japan before WWE was as well

[1:48:35] <+JustToWatch> I have missed that slide more times than I will admit
[1:48:39] <+SammyOVision> And I think you can still go back to the tower at 53 after this, if what I saw was correct.
[1:48:44] <NBUsagi> I mean getting to see Beast Mode Woolie again is always worht it
[1:48:49] <+JustToWatch> @SammyOVision correct

[1:49:34] <+Fabpsi_> the lady can't even take a lot of hits in the first place

[1:51:30] <%LastHazzerd> @mechslayer71 then what must he do different?

[1:51:37] <niffinbox> you are doing it too early
[1:51:41] <+ArcanumArcanum> are you pressing circle early?
[1:51:50] <+mechslayer71> he's holding to early, guaranteed @lasthazzerd
[1:51:57] <jubejube56> Could be a bug, I’ve seen some weird things in this game
[1:51:57] <+Tuffty> Guys he's taking down normal enemies ok

[1:53:37] <teflonbilly777> Was that a Liu Kang bicycle kick?
[1:53:37] <OtakuSnake1> Did anyone here ever see an enemy sweep with a pipe before the patch?
[1:53:52] <+sevorai> of course the patch doesnt say anytihng, its a bug
[1:53:57] <+mechslayer71> I've always pressed it distinctly after, so that's never even been how I do it
[1:53:58] <+Tuffty> It's not a problem with execution as you're punching normies just fine so yeah, a bug maybe

[2:01:13] <+mechslayer71> he's been burning them

[2:02:04] <dds333a> The line of succession LUL
[2:02:10] <teflonbilly777> @dds333a Or when Prometheus bodies the whole JLA and then he's beat by a kick to the nuts
[2:02:12] <+Fabpsi_> that 1 dude says "take my hands", then Sean grabs him and it burns, looks a little bit like a literal "take"
[2:02:16] <+Fabpsi_> or like an absorb
[2:02:16] <%RyTYoung> Tell me whyy SingsMic
[2:02:26] <+theoldone001> Dad did shady shit, turned a new leaf and Yang was repercussions for that past. Maybe??
[2:02:36] <+thedream_c> interesting lore
[2:02:37] <dds333a> @teflonbilly777 also a great one
[2:02:38] <%LastHazzerd> is that like... a lucky charm tag? or a fire extinguisher? next to key
[2:02:47] <+thedream_c> good cocnept for expand storytelling
[2:02:51] <Cha0ticSoul> AIN'T NUTHIN BET A HEARTACE
[2:02:59] <+Fabpsi_> @LastHazzerd it is, carefull, spoiler, a fancy usb stick
[2:03:05] <DSD24> This duo kills so many people
[2:03:06] <+Fabpsi_> first time i thought it was a fire extinguisher too
[2:03:07] <%RyTYoung> TELL ME WHYY SingsMic woolieGASM
[2:03:09] <niffinbox> he does do something
[2:03:09] <Awesome_Leaf> guess those two in the backroom werent the same people
[2:03:14] <+kaztinka> god fuck this room
[2:03:15] <niffinbox> but I wont spoil
[2:03:17] <+thedream_c> it is

[2:03:22] <DSD24> So cool
[2:03:23] <+Fabpsi_> those tiny nightmare steps
[2:03:24] <%LastHazzerd> aww i was hoping these guys were the same in the VIP room
[2:03:24] <letshavecakes> The synchronized arm thrusts
[2:03:26] <jubejube56> Might as well squeeze in an extra Sean kill
[2:03:28] <dds333a> Katas LUL
[2:03:31] <+thedream_c> ifu can knock em off a platform tho, its fair game
[2:03:33] <%LastHazzerd> so they'd be gone if you beat em there
[2:03:34] <velgaduere> bastards
[2:03:39] <+Ninjamaninjas> Throwing em down the stairs does big damage
[2:03:42] <atomicxdj> Sup doods HeyGuys
[2:03:42] <+JustToWatch> Drift Compatible
[2:03:44] <velgaduere> @LastHazzerd nope
[2:03:45] <teflonbilly777> @jubejube56 Sean deserves a few extra beatings
[2:03:49] <Estuko> @LastHazzerd nope hahah
[2:03:53] <+rrratbastard> good stairs assist there
[2:04:15] <+mechslayer71> just tested the seamless thing woolie is referring to, that worked for me too
[2:04:16] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus for your awareness: there are weapons in Sean's first phase on the sides of the room
[2:04:19] <letshavecakes> It carries over if you get a lower age
[2:04:30] <jforrest96> Can I get a HELL YEAH?
[2:04:44] <SomeAsianDood> it will carry over if you have a lower age so no in this case
[2:04:44] <+JustToWatch> it will carry over on this run, but not if you die or restart
[2:04:44] <dds333a> How many times must we teach you this lesson, old man
[2:04:44] <DSD24> I like this song
[2:04:45] <teflonbilly777> HELL YEAH! *pours beer all ove rhimself*
[2:04:48] <%livlinn> grymHELLYEAH
[2:04:53] <velgaduere> it's nice for carrying one into the second phase
[2:05:00] <velgaduere> whatever's in your hands, you keep
[2:05:05] <+Fabpsi_> maaaan
[2:05:07] <+Fabpsi_> poor boss
[2:05:09] <@Menitta> that's why weapon buffs are so good for this stage
[2:05:11] <+thedream_c> the high string I think people can get used to dodging
[2:05:24] <+thedream_c> but its that sweeping one that u get sucker punched with
[2:05:25] <+Fabpsi_> getting bullied by woolie
[2:05:27] <DSD24> Weapon buffs in general are good
[2:05:38] <+Tizona824> These fights turn into a real ass whipping once you download their strings
[2:05:43] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Honestly screw dodging sweeps,just hold block lol
[2:05:52] <TheSaltminer> I must be doing something right, Woolie's using the same combos I do
[2:05:56] <+Fabpsi_> "i thought-SLAP"
[2:05:56] <DSD24> "I thought" BAM
[2:05:57] <%LastHazzerd> you THOUGHT
[2:06:03] <BlackermanZX> bitch you thought
[2:06:03] <dds333a> @tizona824 always the best part of ANYTHING that has fighting
[2:06:07] <velgaduere> lobosDied
[2:06:13] <+mechslayer71> I wonder, do pc and console have different updates right now? that might explain woolies problem with sweeps into ground and pound
[2:06:17] <Cha0ticSoul> "I thought-SWEEP"
[2:06:17] <velgaduere> (except, y'know, thought)
[2:06:24] <+thedream_c> dodges are great against better opponents
[2:06:24] <jubejube56> I’ve been trying to do the heavy heavy palm thrust heavy followup for punishes
[2:06:28] <DSD24> The low seep
[2:06:30] <%RyTYoung> Sean “You’re almost as good as Yang, I’d thought you’d almos- OHUH”
[2:06:34] <+thedream_c> just a amtter of knowing their patterns
[2:06:36] <%RyTYoung> What a good game
[2:06:38] <+SammyOVision> He might do low sweep when he turns red
[2:06:39] <letshavecakes> He starts doing it way more once het lights on fire
[2:06:45] <velgaduere> his enrage also starts at a lower HP now
[2:06:48] <alexandrecau> no one like a thinker sean
[2:06:48] <+mechslayer71> he also commits to combos more it seems. rather than backing off
[2:06:49] <%CarcerDun> dude loves his high combos
[2:06:52] <+Ninjamaninjas> He usually does it after he catches fire
[2:06:53] <+thedream_c> ohh
[2:06:58] <+TheFrancix> will he spare him this time?
[2:07:01] <velgaduere> enrage seems to be at 25% now
[2:07:01] <wandelmilch> Watch out for the pheonix he throws out in phase two
[2:07:01] <teflonbilly777> I never learned how to anticipate the sweep swing
[2:07:06] <+thedream_c> yeah after sean, the bosses with stupid lows start to come up more
[2:07:11] <+thedream_c> advancing sweeps
[2:07:12] <+Fabpsi_> helping him up just to sweep his feet away again
[2:07:14] <AvroEltz> Oh yeah, he usually did the low after the shoulder, now its mostly high
[2:07:15] <%pi_in_the_sci> Spare him
[2:07:17] <letshavecakes> He actually enters his final form way later now
[2:07:18] <+Xx_HD_xX> It's slower
[2:07:19] <dds333a> Woolie has this man dead to rights
[2:07:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I notice each boss has a specific elemental theme
[2:07:25] <TigerClaws12> wait it's punishable now? LUL
[2:07:25] <BlackermanZX> if he spares will it save
[2:07:27] <%RyTYoung> I’ve only fought 4-5 bosses so far and yeah Sean has been the hardest so far
[2:07:29] <+crybirb> No, the hardest was the 3rd, and you beat it easily
[2:07:31] <DSD24> That's very different
[2:07:33] <letshavecakes> Chat with the goddamn spoilers, shut the hell up
[2:07:33] <Awesome_Leaf> how do you spare?
[2:07:34] <+Fabpsi_> no spares yet
[2:07:35] <%RyTYoung> But not by much
[2:07:37] <+Tizona824> Setting yourself on fire doesn't seem like a good power
[2:07:37] <teflonbilly777> SMASH HIS PUMPKIN
[2:07:38] <emptyantics> They nerfed every single boss
[2:07:40] <+SammyOVision> No paciFIST run yet
[2:07:46] <+thedream_c> hmmm
[2:07:49] <+thedream_c> u right
[2:07:49] <BlackermanZX> damn nerfed to hell
[2:07:53] <Awesome_Leaf> "pacifist"
[2:07:55] <MonsieurScratch> @ballerswagbro9k Yeah, it's the chinese 5 elements, Wuxing.
[2:07:55] <emptyantics> They made it easier for Game Jornos
[2:07:58] <%LastHazzerd> Child murder is not a compelling set up for sparing people
[2:07:59] <$ZeOrbling> hardest for me is still the last fight, sean was ezpz
[2:08:01] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus his enrage started at 25% HP instead of 50%
[2:08:03] <+thedream_c> i think its fair
[2:08:03] <TigerClaws12> forced journalist mode FeelsBadMan
[2:08:05] <+thedream_c> sorta
[2:08:07] <%RemedyofRevenge> this game aint for the passive fists
[2:08:08] <+Fabpsi_> @Awesome_Leaf in the 2nd phase, you do not finish him and wait until the prompt is away. Afterwards you block every hit, don't attack and then whe nthe finisher prompt appears again, you can instead spare the boss
[2:08:10] <T_Sasquatch> People are bitxhedr
[2:08:13] <Cha0ticSoul> I'll be back later ya'll
[2:08:16] <alexandrecau> practicing the death knuckle
[2:08:16] <T_Sasquatch> Bitches*
[2:08:21] <DSD24> Now guys I don't think its for game journos
[2:08:23] <+ValHollaYoloson> Lame
[2:08:24] <dds333a> LUL
[2:08:26] <teflonbilly777> @RemedyofRevenge Man, I should go back to Way Of The Passive Fist
[2:08:28] <+ArcanumArcanum> @Fabpsi_ you can attack
[2:08:33] <+ArcanumArcanum> you just cant drain their health bar
[2:08:35] <%Lion_kun> Put it back in the hard mode
[2:08:35] <+thedream_c> sean is a wack MU after that first area
[2:08:37] <%LastHazzerd> they also gotta stop folk from refunding the game
[2:08:38] <Ipsenscastle> A really small percentage of players were beating him
[2:08:41] <%Raios22> Raios22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:08:43] <Awesome_Leaf> oh interesting! ty @Fabpsi_ !
[2:08:45] <+thedream_c> and they STIL haven't set you up for the next 3 bosses after
[2:08:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[2:08:46] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Wah? Sean ain't hard, phase one of Kukori is just. Guess high low for the first 3 tries
[2:08:49] <+Fabpsi_> yea but blokcing fills the bar good enough, it was easier for me that way^^'
[2:08:51] <+Xx_HD_xX> The end of the fight was intially a pain due to him backing off all the time & following up
[2:08:57] <%DaRoosta89> he was obnoxious but not unbeatable
[2:09:03] <TigerClaws12> journalists win again FeelsBadMan
[2:09:09] <MonsieurScratch> Journalists that reviewed the game litterally had an hardest version, nerfed for release. The jokes are wack, here.
[2:09:14] <+Jiggisnipe> I guess it makes sense since he's a dodge test and people are aggro
[2:09:21] <+thedream_c> i think it was more about the club being annoying before you get to sean. Then he ages you considerably if you can't adjust
[2:09:24] <@Menitta> ooooh
[2:09:24] <+Jiggisnipe> same thing has people refusing to block in fighting games
[2:09:27] <dds333a> Woolie can hold the distinction of learning old Sean LUL
[2:09:32] <letshavecakes> It's not a bug, it's just a negative consequence of the game's design
[2:09:32] <SomeAsianDood> lowest death is priority it's annoying
[2:09:33] <%LastHazzerd> is that a bug? or intentional?
[2:09:36] <+Fabpsi_> time to be 53 again!
[2:09:39] <+Fabpsi_> feeeeel your bones
[2:09:40] <DSD24> Tower time
[2:09:42] <velgaduere> and naturally, any shrines you miss get saved over unless you run the level again
[2:09:49] <%RyTYoung> No lie I think they have fixed it
[2:09:50] <DSD24> We got cool clothes at 53 so its fine
[2:09:53] <%pi_in_the_sci> I love his middle age look with the jacket
[2:09:53] <Awesome_Leaf> seems that shrine "best run" thing could be patched
[2:09:54] <TigerClaws12> it's an oversight
[2:09:54] <+ArcanumArcanum> I hope they patch shrines locking in permanently when you do an age 20 run
[2:09:54] <%RyTYoung> I’ll type it out just now
[2:09:56] <+Fabpsi_> i think it is a consequence of design and not a bug
[2:09:58] <letshavecakes> bruh
[2:10:03] <+TheFrancix> at least you can permanently unlock moves
[2:10:06] <+Xx_HD_xX> Deus ex stage Kappa
[2:10:07] <TigerClaws12> a big oversight
[2:10:16] <dds333a> back to the PS2
[2:10:27] <+thedream_c> the roguelike consequence
[2:10:31] <%LastHazzerd> practice a level 1000 times
[2:10:32] <+TheFrancix> lol it's the ps2 startup
[2:10:36] <+ArcanumArcanum> no you can't do a better 20 run
[2:10:38] <+Fabpsi_> look at that playstation background
[2:10:38] <HedgehogGames1> You cannot do a better 20 run.
[2:10:39] <%pi_in_the_sci> you sort of can
[2:10:40] <+ArcanumArcanum> your first age 20 run locks in permanently
[2:10:42] <emptyantics> Rougelights be like
[2:10:44] <@Menitta> LUL this is a PS2 startup
[2:10:44] <leith_aziz> Deus Ex Human Revolution style
[2:10:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Take shortcuts at your own risk
[2:10:55] <+mechslayer71> age-ist, smh
[2:10:59] <VJdarkworld> aging be like
[2:11:00] <ZeeJiggle> It's confusing and could be explained better.
[2:11:02] <HedgehogGames1> Age is the ONLY thing it cares about.
[2:11:03] <emptyantics> @menitta :( take me back
[2:11:11] <%pi_in_the_sci> you can always roll into the next level with what you have on you
[2:11:12] <+SammyOVision> I think it might be lowest age reached, most recent shrines, that's the only way I can think you should do it
[2:11:12] <letshavecakes> Optimization isn't that important anyway
[2:11:15] <BlackermanZX> big oversight
[2:11:16] <dds333a> @mechslayer71 nice LUL
[2:11:22] <+Xx_HD_xX> & if you replace your age 20 run with a new one your shrine upgrades do not overwrite the initial ones
[2:11:26] <%LastHazzerd> is there a way to fully restart
[2:11:27] <%RyTYoung> Never mind I’m wrong, this game is just confusing NotLikeThis
[2:11:28] <velgaduere> @HedgehogGames1 apparently someone claimed otherwise with a 14-page document last session
[2:11:32] <leith_aziz> Age is all that matters? Is this a Japanese company? cohhSus
[2:11:35] <+mechslayer71> 40 plus is a vibe tho, I dig it
[2:11:38] <dds333a> oooh, cinematic
[2:11:39] <VJdarkworld> a game design that says 'you peaked at 20 bro'
[2:11:44] <DSD24> The Tower
[2:11:46] <+JustToWatch> Woolie isn't locked out yet though, his best squats run is age 21
[2:11:52] <@Menitta> It's a very interesting game. It's unlike anything I've played

[2:27:18] <Mirakei> @mechslayer71 but if you prepare a file where you start every level at max age you should be able to do it faster.  Than if you do it all at age 20 no deaths.
[2:27:22] <NBUsagi> remember, you can just stab XD
[2:27:27] <DSD24> Yo that lady is gonna fight you in her business outfit

[2:43:31] <+mechslayer71> gotta hold that charge for a while
[2:43:32] <+crybirb> if this is in japan it makes sense, not even yakuza goes around with weapons because it's a certainty of being prossecuted 20+ years if just found with one.
[2:43:36] <GhostlySkunk> WOOLIE POOLIE! <3
[2:43:42] <emptyantics> Dead
[2:44:00] <+Fabpsi_> not stylish enough to kick those stylish chairs
[2:44:01] <letshavecakes> @crybirb It's in china
[2:44:04] <+ernastyb> They say drop the weapon madam. If you're younger does the dialogue change?
[2:44:08] <+vaderxyz1970> heavy as hell
[2:44:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:44:10] <SomeAsianDood> hk has similar level of gun regulations
[2:44:11] <+thedream_c> oh u can't ambush that dude walking directly above
[2:44:13] <NBUsagi> @crybirb Isn the Yakuza prefered weapon knives these days?
[2:44:13] <+SammyOVision> If things get too tough, I'm fine watching you lab Kuroki more.
[2:44:14] <+Javaa01> They're well balanced chairs
[2:44:22] <+thedream_c> ahhh cmd grbd
[2:44:23] <+Fabpsi_> mhh...60, we should have the fancy taunts by now, right?
[2:44:23] <jubejube56> Those chairs are ergonomic woolie, kick proof
[2:44:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i hate those grabs
[2:44:32] <OblivionSword1> Asia in general have very strict gun regulations
[2:44:33] <+crybirb> @letshavecakes, I think china has strong laws against public holding weapons too, last I remember
[2:44:37] <letshavecakes> Woolie hasn't been taunting at all
[2:44:38] <+Tizona824> Action is coming
[2:44:40] <+thedream_c> she was lookin
[2:44:49] <HawkGoggles2> the worlds most brittle furniture
[2:45:01] <%RyTYoung> I hate that move
[2:45:04] <+mechslayer71> nah, they did that back in the club, you just never saw it
[2:45:05] <+thedream_c> makes sense they can
[2:45:05] <+crybirb> @NBUsagi, they use knifes because it's easier to hide, you will not be arrested if found with one and you know, they are yakuza. if you are found with a gun in japan chances are you are going to jail for a long time.
[2:45:10] <+thedream_c> and the axe kick
[2:45:16] <%SirGO0SE> AXE KICK
[2:45:17] <LeeOhX> she actually disappeared there
[2:45:21] <+Zero_Jacks> that Otg tho
[2:45:26] <emptyantics> AXE KICK
[2:45:27] <NBUsagi> @crybirb Oh i knew about that, guns are super rare in Japan
[2:45:34] <+thedream_c> ye ol steel petal
[2:45:43] <%CateHecate> @crybirb considering this game takes place in china it makes guns even more rare and more dangerous to have illegally
[2:45:44] <+crybirb> @NBUsagi, I wonder if China is like Japan with citzens using guns.
[2:46:01] <+crybirb> @CateHecate, So the rules in china are more strict against citzens holding guns? I have no idea
[2:46:07] <DXLelouch24> Towe has NO CHILL
[2:46:10] <%CateHecate> assuredly
[2:46:11] <NBUsagi> @crybirb It would be neat to travel someday and see...lol well like as a tourist, not as a dumbass waiting to get stabbed XP
[2:46:13] <DXLelouch24> Tower*
[2:46:17] <+thedream_c> yeah hard to say. if weapons are as accessible for them to begin with
[2:46:35] <+crybirb> @NBUsagi, oh yeah, I hope nobody goes touring for stabs hahahah
[2:46:37] <+thedream_c> in the good ol USA of A u can order those make a gun off the internet

[2:47:49] <+crybirb> @NBUsagi, yeah I'll never stop being impressed by people stupidity, like in the news a brazillian died because he jumped in a frozen lake in Canada or something, just for a video challenge
[2:47:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @awesome_leaf Why would you takedown the environment? woolieMIRIN
[2:48:08] <Awesome_Leaf> lol fuck them trees
[2:48:33] <NBUsagi> @crybirb Oh yeah, the age of Tik Toks and Youtube Stardom is basically a test of Darwinism in its own right
[2:48:37] <+Fabpsi_> and you gave her that knife
[2:48:42] <+Commander_Warthog> The accounting department kicks ass
[2:48:58] <+thedream_c> oh u can do that
[2:49:03] <+CameronBryce> I really wish the practice area had different types of enemies to practice against, because it'd be way nicer to learn movesets in a controlled environment
[2:49:06] <+thedream_c> buy some i frames hopping on those barriers
[2:49:14] <+thedream_c> WOOF
[2:49:18] <FloatYourGoat> need to get that age down...

[2:49:50] <LeeOhX> sometimes you gotta learn on the fly
[2:49:53] <jubejube56> Training against more than just a grunt would be lovely
[2:49:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah it's a huge help to get through younger
[2:50:05] <Awesome_Leaf> "welcome madam" breaks ankles
[2:50:05] <+Jiggisnipe> wow lots of blood
[2:50:09] <DSD24> I hope this get gets alternate outfits
[2:50:13] <%ChoculaUltra> that was quite the stain
[2:50:17] <letshavecakes> It's less how old you are, and more the death counter; might be worth spending a shrine on it
[2:50:19] <+thedream_c> yeah more comforting to learn on the fly when u have youth on your side
[2:50:19] <DSD24> Though mods already exist
[2:50:42] <%MajorCrasher> what kinda mods?
[2:50:50] <niffinbox> theres a rock lee mod
[2:50:56] <jubejube56> Oh something odd I found, doing palm thrust after throw seems to let you track and keep up with the enemy
[2:50:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @MajorCrasher like complete model change mods
[2:51:06] <DSD24> @majorcrasher people modded in daredevil costumes

[2:52:13] <+Xx_HD_xX> It's throw away
[2:52:17] <+OffbeatMinority> ohh
[2:52:24] <DSD24> The coolest thing would be a Absolver Costume
[2:53:04] <MonsieurScratch> @dsd24 Playing as Risryn or Kuretz would be dope.
[2:53:30] <DSD24> @monsieurscratch Yep! I was thinking of those two actuallyb
[2:53:35] <+FoxLex_> sometimes it's better to dodge than parry
[2:53:38] <niffinbox> theres rock lee/john wick/shaggy/daredevil/snow white reskin mods
[2:53:47] <Justlaxy> Sturdy boys
[2:53:59] <DSD24> Thought I would want a Khalit Method single player game one day
[2:53:59] <+FoxLex_> As the rewards are different between dodge punish and parry
[2:54:21] <letshavecakes> 5'11'' vs. 6
[2:54:55] <DSD24> JingFei looks real cool though
[2:54:56] <letshavecakes> Not many beer bottles in an office building
[2:55:09] <+Xx_HD_xX> It does have the atmosphere of Deus Ex Human Revolution though lol
[2:55:11] <velgaduere> @letshavecakes there could be more furniture to kick
[2:55:14] <%Gruhunchously> RIP her spine

[2:57:59] <radiorosewater> is wolly hollowing out yet?
[2:58:02] <%Gruhunchously> Wow, welcome to Picus tower

[2:58:41] <%RyTYoung> @mechslayer71 yeah I saw a yt thumbnail where it’s daredevil with everyone behind him in the corridor dead LUL
[2:58:44] <%townzzzzz> customer service is rough
[2:58:44] <+OffbeatMinority> Yeahhh I just now saw the tweet from Ben. Big OOF
[2:58:55] <+BiggusWingless> There is more than one tweet
[2:58:58] <+mechslayer71> why does woolie keep throwing his knife for that low ass damage
[2:59:02] <+BiggusWingless> Oh Ben

[2:59:30] <majindusto> Ben?
[2:59:31] <%oneimportantthing> Guys I don't have twitter what did Ben say
[2:59:35] <IzanagiNoOokami> Ben Deez Nuts.
[2:59:37] <+BiggusWingless> He wants to bang his sister
[2:59:38] <%RyTYoung> Ohh fuck that guy
[2:59:38] <Enyoyable> Bendeez nuts
[2:59:42] <+Urgoslav> heh heh heh heh
[2:59:53] <%Gruhunchously> Last shot
[3:00:07] <letshavecakes> All I'm seeing is that one fake tweet from over a year ago
[3:00:11] <AstrodropGaming> Getting rocked by Tiger Joe out there
[3:00:18] <%oneimportantthing> @bigguswingless I can't believe he literally said that.... actually I guess I can
[3:00:33] <Invess> what's going on in here, chat
[3:00:49] <%oneimportantthing> @invess Apparently Ben Shapiro is hot for his sister
[3:00:57] <+mechslayer71> lol there's a gameplay "improvement" mod that just makes the game easier OMEGALUL
[3:00:57] <Invess> @oneimportantthing yeah i buy that
[3:00:58] <+BiggusWingless> We're watching Woolie do kung fu while discussing Ben Shapiro wanting to bang his sister
[3:01:03] <bigshedman> Anyway how about this here video game huh?
[3:01:09] <%Gruhunchously> Just a normal day on Woolie Vs
[3:01:11] <letshavecakes> Just someone baiting about a random political figure in a video game stream
[3:01:18] <iamtheTwitchghost> wait, you guys DON'T wanna bang your sister???????
[3:01:18] <+BiggusWingless> A random political figure?
[3:01:20] <+BiggusWingless> Lol WHAT
[3:01:26] <%oneimportantthing> @bigshedman we need a Ben Shapiro mod for this game
[3:01:29] <radiorosewater> pretty disco if ya ask me
[3:01:44] <+Tizona824> Yep
[3:01:51] <letshavecakes> @BiggusWingless Are you seriously trying to argue it's relevance here?
[3:01:53] <%oneimportantthing> Where every punch makes a FACTS sound and every kick makes a LOGIC sound
[3:01:58] <velgaduere> @BiggusWingless hey what if we just talked about the game and what's going on in stream instead of a twitter pundit saying stupid shit 🤔
[3:01:58] <%Gruhunchously> 1 v 1
[3:02:07] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[3:02:08] <%townzzzzz> FAT
[3:02:22] <+BiggusWingless> Sorry for bringing up Ben Shapiro wanting to bang his sister on twitter today, I thought it was funny
[3:02:23] <%Gruhunchously> Don't mess with the old lady with the broom
[3:02:23] <%townzzzzz> wait, how
[3:02:24] <velgaduere> @BiggusWingless like, you've made your point and we all know the news now
[3:02:27] <CommandantKobold> She
[3:02:37] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe
[3:02:44] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe the benefits are really really good
[3:02:52] <Invess> well they likely know there's an afterlife
[3:02:58] <Invess> so that ain't nothing
[3:03:00] <AvroEltz> Nah do it again tho
[3:03:01] <SomeAsianDood> jump off the edge again woolie
[3:03:19] <%Gruhunchously> Trolling first timer, I guess
[3:03:25] <%RyTYoung> Omg I didn’t see Woolie walk off the edge NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:03:26] <LeeOhX> it's pretty funny
[3:03:27] <Invess> "ha, got em"
[3:03:31] <IzanagiNoOokami> Or will you?\
[3:03:39] <velgaduere> fall damage can occur from stairs, though that's a slightly different flavor of fall damage
[3:03:45] <+Urgoslav> got to keep people on their toes
[3:03:55] <AvroEltz> I mean, is one death, if you can revive, then its progress
[3:04:04] <%oneimportantthing> I want a mod for this game where instead of male/female it's Woolie or Pat
[3:04:05] <%LastHazzerd> is there gonna be more oater on?
[3:04:24] <Invess> later?
[3:04:25] <radiorosewater> !uptime
[3:04:26] <@Moobot> @radiorosewater WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 20 minutes
[3:04:30] <+Urgoslav> doors are for the strong
[3:04:33] <Estuko> @oneimportantthing Remerai's models from youtube?
[3:04:34] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[3:04:35] <majindusto> enigmaKEK
[3:04:35] <SomeAsianDood> there's already a mod where you can play as wide sifu
[3:04:45] <FloatYourGoat> hes in the clear if he gets past a particularly brutal room in here
[3:04:47] <Estuko> or GoogleyGareth's versions
[3:04:51] <%Gruhunchously> This is the part where the trippy shit begins
[3:04:54] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you try opening stone doors and see if its easy
[3:04:54] <T_Sasquatch> @oneimportantthing there's already a mod where you can play as the child version
[3:05:07] <emptyantics> Someone modded Scorpion from MK into the game
[3:05:22] <majindusto> THE GUARDIAN  CODE!
[3:05:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[3:05:32] <+crybirb> there is already a naked sifu mod
[3:05:36] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:05:37] <IzanagiNoOokami> Welcome back to the Absolver Fight Mines.
[3:05:41] <iacus_> LUL
[3:05:45] <+mechslayer71> they have magic, woolie
[3:05:46] <+Urgoslav> everyone is bodied by a Gracie
[3:05:46] <%oneimportantthing> @crybirb ffs why
[3:05:48] <AvroEltz> IT TAKES ONE MMA FIGHTER
[3:05:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:05:59] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus MMA aint got shit on LITERAL MAGIC BULLSHIT
[3:06:01] <iacus_> maybe they have BJJ magic
[3:06:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CAPOEIRA FUCKS
[3:06:04] <+crybirb> @oneimportantthing, people are wondering why for so long but the correct question is "why not?"
[3:06:04] <velgaduere> but... all orders are made-up...
[3:06:08] <Enyoyable> MMA for SURE got magic in this world too
[3:06:10] <sirrice77> If mma stays around for long enough will it also develop mystic magic techniques?
[3:06:18] <AstrodropGaming> And suddenly, your fighting Kitana
[3:06:29] <%Gruhunchously> bodied
[3:06:31] <DXLelouch24> and its over
[3:06:31] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @crybirb
[3:06:31] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @crybirb
[3:06:34] <Invess> she said drop it
[3:06:37] <%oneimportantthing> I wonder if elections in this world happen by presidential candidates fistfighting each other
[3:06:40] <+crybirb> 🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷
[3:06:50] <BlackermanZX> rip
[3:06:51] <iamtheTwitchghost> BRASIL PORRA
[3:06:52] <%Gruhunchously> Played College Ball, Yknow
[3:06:54] <Treasure_Vault> Might be time for the museum
[3:07:05] <DXLelouch24> tower at 52 is WAY too old imo
[3:07:07] <DXLelouch24> get that down
[3:07:08] <penitentpendant> @oneimportantthing That's how Senator Armstrong keeps his seat
[3:07:10] <emptyantics> Sopa de Sifu uma delicia HypeYum
[3:07:13] <%LastHazzerd> is there a maximum allowed age?
[3:07:24] <%RyTYoung> Oh boy
[3:07:31] <DXLelouch24> @LastHazzerd 20
[3:07:34] <penitentpendant> @LastHazzerd Any death over 70 = Game Over
[3:07:35] <emptyantics> @lasthazzerd 75
[3:07:37] <+crybirb> @oneimportantthing, I think that happened in Mongolia at some point and it didn't work out so great
[3:07:39] <%pi_in_the_sci> You can find something new in the club now
[3:07:40] <%LastHazzerd> gotcha
[3:07:42] <SomeAsianDood> 78? 69+9 is probably as high as u can go
[3:07:42] <letshavecakes> You could genuinely save this run literally just by spending a shrine to reset deaths
[3:07:43] <DXLelouch24> oh allowed
[3:07:45] <DXLelouch24> yea 75
[3:07:46] <iacus_> @LastHazzerd after your 70's you die for real
[3:07:50] <+SammyOVision> @LastHazzerd 70 is when you run out of respawns
[3:07:55] <DXLelouch24> your maximum youth is 20
[3:07:58] <+mechslayer71> but shrine doe
[3:07:59] <DXLelouch24> then your runs locked
[3:08:12] <%oneimportantthing> So how do you de-age? Asking for myself, I'm 30 :|
[3:08:18] <+Xx_HD_xX> Yeh
[3:08:20] <letshavecakes> You're not gonna beat the tower at 21 lmao
[3:08:20] <DXLelouch24> you have to beat Squats at 20
[3:08:25] <DXLelouch24> DO IT
[3:08:26] <Treasure_Vault> Let her kick your ass a couple times
[3:08:30] <Treasure_Vault> Or that
[3:08:31] <%pi_in_the_sci> It isn't that hard to get all the shrines without fighting most of it
[3:08:31] <%RyTYoung> @woolieversus do the second exhibition to get the first shrine, then get the shrine on the top floor, then the one in the boss room
[3:08:37] <AstrodropGaming> Maybe take a death or two in the Museum
[3:08:38] <+mechslayer71> @oneimportantthing jump off a bridge and hope reincarnation is real? or just embrace it
[3:08:38] <+Urgoslav> young and dumb, or old and wise?
[3:08:40] <BlackermanZX> die like 2 times
[3:08:43] <ProjektRF> Losing out on shrines is pretty good just to have a lower age
[3:08:45] <FassieFons> "tighter age" sounds so cursed
[3:08:59] <emptyantics> The best way to so is second exhibition to get the first shrine, then get the shrine on the top floor, then the one in the boss room
[3:09:02] <%oneimportantthing> @mechslayer71 sounds logical
[3:09:04] <jetstreamlove_R> gotta play it safe
[3:09:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can get all 3 with minimal effort though
[3:09:14] <+mechslayer71> but the goal is to be younger
[3:09:15] <letshavecakes> Skipping shrines just to have a tighter kung fussy
[3:09:16] <BlackermanZX> you could die 2 times but not in a row. Die after the mid boss ladies
[3:09:18] <+Xx_HD_xX> Yes it would be
[3:09:20] <+SammyOVision> You're not going to deathless the boss yet
[3:09:30] <DXLelouch24> you can totally get all shrines and not die too much
[3:09:43] <+mechslayer71> you get 1
[3:09:44] <DXLelouch24> i mean he could cheese her, he beat her legit already
[3:09:46] <+Xx_HD_xX> It wont erase your shrines
[3:09:47] <HawkGoggles2> Its about the upgrades
[3:09:50] <DXLelouch24> needs crotch punch tho
[3:09:52] <+SammyOVision> You can take the stairwell shortcut to grab the shrines
[3:09:58] <DeathByPoke7> i usually pick up the first shrine here
[3:10:00] <%Gruhunchously> God this level is beautiful
[3:10:02] <OblivionSword1> you can get at least 2 with the shortcut2
[3:10:04] <letshavecakes> So just get the goddamn shrines woolie, this whole level is open, the shortcuts are still usable
[3:10:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus you can get the first shrine the normal way, then skip with stairs to the 2nd one and then elevator to the 3rd
[3:10:07] <+mechslayer71> yeah the bat moveset is the best one
[3:10:43] <+Xx_HD_xX> I know there's one on flor 4 before the weird door
[3:10:45] <%RyTYoung> @woolieversus second exhibition where the ink pen is, the top floor, then take the elevator for the last shrine
[3:10:49] <ZeeJiggle> If you want the level score or xp, yeah you're gonna have to fight dudes.
[3:10:51] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus if you dont mind cheesing Kuroki since you already beat her legit you can spam crotch punch with knife to easily stunlock her,
[3:10:56] <@Solidus_113> does the knockout prompt last long enough to taunt and still get it?
[3:10:59] <jetstreamlove_R> perfect run boys let's go
[3:11:04] <%Gruhunchously> nice hat
[3:11:17] <ZeeJiggle> @Solidus_113 With dodge cancelling yeh
[3:11:24] <DXLelouch24> afterall theres no honor in Sifu
[3:11:54] <%Gruhunchously> These guys (well, their boss anyway) were down with child murder. So yeah, no honor.
[3:11:55] <jetstreamlove_R> God the parrycounter get so much structure damage, i love it
[3:11:58] <QueequegTheater> This museum has no honor
[3:12:04] <majindusto> If only you could  grab Two Bats
[3:12:08] <%oneimportantthing> In Sifu-world, school curriculums is nothing but different martial artstyles
[3:12:12] <QueequegTheater> Powerstanced bats
[3:12:20] <jetstreamlove_R> the paintings have no honor
[3:12:28] <emptyantics> How to get punchwaifu PoroSad
[3:12:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:12:30] <letshavecakes> I wish this game had different styles you could learn like Absolver had
[3:12:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i love spamming those lightbulbs at em
[3:12:42] <%Gruhunchously> Paint 'em red and make 'em dead
[3:12:42] <+mechslayer71> God chat, which should I get, Warhammer 3 or Elden ring?
[3:12:51] <+mechslayer71> jk I'm getting elden ring
[3:12:54] <SomeAsianDood> there's a shit ton of throwables this level
[3:12:59] <emptyantics> Elden Ring
[3:13:00] <QueequegTheater> @mechslayer71 Do you want an RTS or an ARPG
[3:13:02] <radiorosewater> @mechslayer71 Elden, WH3 is buggy rn
[3:13:03] <%DaRoosta89> @cobalt_phoenix_ same, it feels like a Jakie Chan scene there
[3:13:06] <emptyantics> Warhammer will go on sale eventually
[3:13:12] <jetstreamlove_R> Warhammer 3 is kinda bugged right now
[3:13:15] <%ChoculaUltra> warhammer 3 is on game pass too :)
[3:13:19] <Treasure_Vault> Like Elden Ring isn't gonna be buggy Day 1
[3:13:21] <radiorosewater> @jetstreamlove_R this
[3:13:31] <Estuko> I'd say down if my friend knocked me out with a missed swing during combat. what an jerk LUL
[3:13:35] <QueequegTheater> @Treasure_Vault FROMsoft games aren't buggy on release
[3:13:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DaRoosta89 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1
[3:13:38] <+mechslayer71> I said jk guys. I've already decide on ring now, WH3 later. I'll play wh2 in ghe meantime
[3:13:38] <letshavecakes> They worked so hard on this kunai setpiece but nobody interacts with it on purpose
[3:13:48] <QueequegTheater> The only real bug is the framerate stuff from Scholar
[3:13:49] <DeathByPoke7> did woolie find the absolver exhibit
[3:13:53] <%xeromage> would be a cool achievement to clear this room without disturbing the pendulum
[3:13:55] <%ChoculaUltra> no play both games like a glutton
[3:14:01] <+SammyOVision> You can probably go back to the stairs now.
[3:14:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DeathByPoke7 ye
[3:14:05] <LeeOhX> I doubt chat would let him walk past it
[3:14:17] <%pi_in_the_sci> weapon catch is good for this boss fight
[3:14:19] <QueequegTheater> I've been preparing for Elden Ring by doing a BL4 run
[3:14:22] <QueequegTheater> It is pain
[3:14:25] <+Xx_HD_xX> We did let him jump off a cliff though LUL
[3:14:34] <ZeeJiggle> You can only learn to BM when you're young.
[3:14:39] <+mechslayer71> but if I get the games pass version, it won't have the blood dlc will it
[3:14:43] <jetstreamlove_R> @DeathByPoke7 He did, got the Easter move and all
[3:14:56] <DeathByPoke7> LUL
[3:14:57] <I3lueIron> lmao
[3:14:59] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:15:00] <+mechslayer71> YOU CAN SLAP THEM
[3:15:01] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:15:16] <+mechslayer71> the 209 baby

[3:15:25] <AstrodropGaming> "I like your cut g"
[3:15:54] <letshavecakes> I hope woolie plays this a bit more tomorrow after finishing bloodborne

[3:18:45] <%RyTYoung> gigaboOtsMEOW
[3:18:48] <+mechslayer71> woolie desires combat understandable
[3:18:51] <velgaduere> despite the lack of sign, the lab is open
[3:18:53] <jetstreamlove_R> ehh more xp
[3:18:54] <spokensun> next time its cool
[3:18:56] <ZeeJiggle> Darn, we gotta play *MORE* of this great combat.
[3:19:05] <%Gruhunchously> Glory Kill these guys
[3:19:13] <majindusto> The Lab it Eternal
[3:19:14] <jetstreamlove_R> play smart and patient
[3:19:18] <%oneimportantthing> This is such a setpiece without being a setpiece. Super refreshing
[3:19:20] <majindusto> *Is
[3:19:24] <emptyantics> Sick kill animation
[3:19:26] <letshavecakes> Those health-on-execution upgrades are also really good for a first run
[3:19:27] <edward0286> It’s still more xp for either skills or point unlocks
[3:19:31] <QueequegTheater> BIG BOI
[3:19:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:19:37] <%Gruhunchously> Cold Clocked
[3:19:47] <BlackermanZX> gotta shank the fat guy
[3:20:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> also leaves room for a new run if you wanna
[3:20:09] <jetstreamlove_R> Uppercut so rough I heard it close where i live LUL
[3:20:18] <%oneimportantthing> So are there difficulty settings in this?
[3:20:25] <%Gruhunchously> no
[3:20:29] <AnnoyedApricot> @oneimportantthing coming in a patch
[3:20:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @oneimportantthing no but i heard they will add em
[3:20:34] <jetstreamlove_R> that girl did not want ya to have it
[3:20:36] <LeeOhX> nope you just gotta be good
[3:20:37] <%Gruhunchously> But appearently they wil be added in a patch
[3:20:37] <AstrodropGaming> Eating punches for dinner in there
[3:21:02] <%CarcerDun> Wollie building the body pile
[3:21:02] <+mechslayer71> so fucking brutal
[3:21:05] <jetstreamlove_R> good old table separation tactic
[3:21:11] <%Gruhunchously> is this Loss?
[3:21:15] <majindusto> ESSENCE  OF SHANK
[3:21:16] <+mechslayer71> this game is just oozing with style. I love it
[3:21:20] <Jaysky> Loss
[3:21:32] <iamtheTwitchghost> loss.jpg
[3:21:34] <%Lion_kun> Question guys, why doesn't woolie beeline it to the boss, what is he gaining by going through the zone?
[3:21:34] <LeeOhX> throw is so GOOD in this hallway
[3:21:40] <AnnoyedApricot> NO TIME TO READ
[3:21:40] <edward0286> Oldboy 2.0
[3:21:43] <%Lion_kun> I am just trying to learn and understand this game.
[3:21:43] <%Gruhunchously> P A I N
[3:21:50] <letshavecakes> @Lion_kun he forgot to take the shortcut
[3:21:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lion_kun he wanted all 3 shrines and thought the elevator would make you skip one
[3:22:07] <%AyotoCorp> How far in is Woolie now anyway, did he beat the Museum yet?
[3:22:07] <UnderpaidBob> there's a taunt button?
[3:22:11] <+thedream_c> woolie just anted that wall death
[3:22:20] <%townzzzzz> ooof
[3:22:20] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[3:22:30] <velgaduere> Reggie casually getting Woolie killed LUL
[3:22:33] <%Lion_kun> So there is no XP gain from killing enemies like in say returnal?
[3:22:38] <letshavecakes> @AyotoCorp He got to tower, but too old to finish
[3:22:46] <majindusto> Reggie  got that Tunnel Vision
[3:22:52] <%Lion_kun> Do the shrines make that big a difference?
[3:22:52] <%Gruhunchously> A N G E R
[3:23:06] <ZeeJiggle> Yeah they're hard to read without rly getting in close.
[3:23:09] <%Lion_kun> Also do shrine buffs end on death?
[3:23:09] <majindusto> ST ANGER
[3:23:14] <%AyotoCorp> @AyotoCorp Ah okay, so he's doing a better run for the museum now
[3:23:16] <%SirGO0SE> PunOko ANGY
[3:23:24] <%townzzzzz> nice eyes
[3:23:25] <ZeeJiggle> Especially the darker text at the bottom.
[3:23:30] <%LastHazzerd> flowery descriptions of the emotion
[3:23:39] <letshavecakes> @ZeeJiggle Darker text is in chinese
[3:23:43] <+crybirb> its meant for VaatiVydia kinda of people to read it
[3:23:48] <Jaysky> Deep
[3:23:50] <velgaduere> lmao
[3:23:51] <penitentpendant> "Skip"
[3:23:52] <+rrratbastard> stab
[3:23:54] <+mechslayer71> @lion_kun enemies give xp, but once you unlock all moves permanently it doesn't matter. shrine bonuses do have some that really matter tho. but he could've taken a shortcut before here and still gotten all the shrines
[3:23:56] <%Gruhunchously> Like an iceberg
[3:23:58] <OblivionSword1> free
[3:23:59] <+SammyOVision> He got the tip of THAT iceberg
[3:24:02] <+Tizona824> "I'm Schizophrenic"
[3:24:03] <velgaduere> this section just ends up being too damn long for low-age runs
[3:24:04] <BlackermanZX> good ol' stab
[3:24:06] <ZeeJiggle> @ZeeJiggle Nah the left is chinese, right is English.
[3:24:10] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[3:24:14] <+Jiggisnipe> lul
[3:24:16] <%LastHazzerd> from off screen!
[3:24:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:24:22] <alexandrecau> here is the icepick
[3:24:28] <%Lion_kun> @mechslayer71 Tx for telling me
[3:24:33] <velgaduere> oh shit, the sweep punish
[3:24:34] <+mechslayer71> np
[3:24:40] <Jaysky> girldmParry
[3:24:46] <+ernastyb> Snuffed
[3:25:00] <jetstreamlove_R> got ya whit the double kick
[3:25:05] <%Gruhunchously> Failure is always an opportunity to learn
[3:25:11] <jetstreamlove_R> right in the baby maker LUL
[3:25:34] <jetstreamlove_R> nice throw!
[3:25:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> clean
[3:25:43] <velgaduere> and now for the hard part
[3:26:07] <jetstreamlove_R> the bayonetta axe kick ladies
[3:26:14] <%oneimportantthing> Everhood vibes
[3:26:17] <%SirGO0SE> i heard you like axe kicks
[3:26:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bro an axe kick with knife shoes is brutal af
[3:26:36] <majindusto> Do they have Blade shoes?
[3:26:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:26:41] <letshavecakes> See this is why the shortcut is helpful
[3:26:48] <+SammyOVision> Weapon catch for the boss?
[3:27:22] <%oneimportantthing> She became my age SwiftRage
[3:28:06] <+sevorai> yeeeee
[3:28:12] <%Lion_kun> DO shrine perks remain after death?
[3:28:24] <+mechslayer71> lebronJAM
[3:28:31] <+crybirb> I love her battle music, this tunning in the background is really mesmerizing
[3:28:35] <%LastHazzerd> are the unlocks at shrines different for each level?
[3:28:41] <jetstreamlove_R> play footsies whit that long ass disjointed hitbox BS
[3:28:41] <letshavecakes> Not woolie running in and genuinely trying to defend against every attack as they come out
[3:28:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so is she immune to ground counters?
[3:28:42] <fistynopunches> did woolie just get here chat?
[3:28:53] <+mechslayer71> @lasthazzerd nah, they're the same
[3:28:54] <edward0286> @lion_kun they do but if you restart a level or run completely, they’re gone
[3:28:58] <+sevorai> nah he's semi-labbing
[3:29:01] <%Gruhunchously> Directed by Hideo Kojima
[3:29:06] <FloatYourGoat> u really need a weapon 4 her
[3:29:09] <zanzibarian_hamster> Literally kuroki
[3:29:10] <+mechslayer71> @fistynopunches he's replaying it
[3:29:12] <velgaduere> this is why there's an elevator straight to her
[3:29:18] <+Meathands> gettin' shmixed
[3:29:19] <fistynopunches> @mechslayer71 thanks
[3:29:30] <%LastHazzerd> @mechslayer71 oh thank god, the fact that you can't do a better run if you finish at 20 is real bad
[3:29:33] <%RyTYoung> Try avoid high then parry lows
[3:29:46] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie can't block that wackass mixup Kappa
[3:29:48] <%LastHazzerd> but at least you don't miss out
[3:29:51] <+OrangeMDT> I need to just get this game, cause I’m not getting the high low issue
[3:29:58] <letshavecakes> It's so much easier to just keep distance until you know which string she's doing, trying to fight her like a punch girl is asking for death
[3:30:01] <jetstreamlove_R> The anti-woolie mixup
[3:30:08] <%LastHazzerd> can you parry blades?
[3:30:11] <OblivionSword1> can you even parry her ?
[3:30:13] <puse9> you can parry it. maybe
[3:30:17] <%pi_in_the_sci> you can parry all that, it's just tricky
[3:30:18] <%Lion_kun> Woolie, try miud range
[3:30:19] <+Deasmeister> chip damage if you block though
[3:30:19] <%LastHazzerd> oh you can
[3:30:21] <+mechslayer71> you can parry itz
[3:30:21] <%oneimportantthing> @letshavecakes but fighting games tho
[3:30:22] <jubejube56> You can parry the staff
[3:30:22] <%AyotoCorp> You can parry and block her, but blocking does chip
[3:30:23] <omega_reddu> Dodge
[3:30:27] <%Lion_kun> mid range*
[3:30:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can parry but the timing is kinda weird
[3:30:35] <edward0286> It’s bladed so chip damage
[3:31:03] <OblivionSword1> what's the timing for the parry ?
[3:31:11] <%RyTYoung> @orangemdt you can avoid attack with L1 and pressing up or down on the left stick, so you press down to avoid any high striking attacks, and up on the stick to avoid any low incoming strikes and sweeps
[3:31:13] <emptyantics> @oblivionsword1 For her it
[3:31:14] <+valiard> Lady is going in with the split staff
[3:31:31] <GunneryGoblin> 40s/50s is probably my favorite looks for the protags of this game
[3:31:33] <%SirGO0SE> done waiting :)
[3:31:47] <+kaztinka> boomer Woolie incoming PoroSad
[3:31:57] <letshavecakes> He died more here than he did on his first run NotLikeThis
[3:32:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "I'm acting"
[3:32:02] <velgaduere> damn Woolie, just taking a dump on the VA like that
[3:32:03] <+mechslayer71> the salt pjSalt
[3:32:05] <+rrratbastard> artists man, they gotta be bitchy
[3:32:08] <puse9> yang has the best voice
[3:32:09] <%Gruhunchously> Well she's an artist
[3:32:11] <DeathByPoke7> whiny art student
[3:32:13] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie voice shaming people now...
[3:32:13] <%bevyrage> wannabe lucy lu
[3:32:13] <%SirGO0SE> Woolie malding in game and irl
[3:32:15] <+VictorVonLouche> Her voice sounds like a Dub VA
[3:32:17] <DXLelouch24> her phase 2 voice is better
[3:32:19] <+mechslayer71> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:32:20] <+vaderxyz1970> using english to flex
[3:32:21] <%LastHazzerd> a serious person would not taunt
[3:32:22] <emptyantics> She’s an artist Woolie
[3:32:30] <NBUsagi> As an artist...yeah saddly they kind of go hand in hand. Specially for the more far sniffy sorts
[3:32:32] <puse9> she is a artist. she gonna sound bratty
[3:32:37] <%RyTYoung> @dxlelouch24 true
[3:32:37] <emptyantics> Artists are self absorbed assholes LUL
[3:32:38] <muxperience> must have been real young when the protag's dad got wasted
[3:32:40] <+rrratbastard> @DXLelouch24 she leans even more into the brattiness there, she shines lmao
[3:32:42] <+theoldone001> Japanese girls and snow fields man
[3:32:42] <skyshinecrusader> Sound like a young person
[3:33:00] <+hybridcode7> Voice shaming
[3:33:04] <DXLelouch24> damn Woolie going full boomer yelling at kids mode
[3:33:06] <%SirGO0SE> nice dodges PogChamp
[3:33:07] <DXLelouch24> smh
[3:33:16] <edward0286> Overhead is a side dodge so left or right
[3:33:18] <+mechslayer71> woolie attacking the way people talk when he gets salty. first in the final convo of disco elysium, now here
[3:33:24] <+theoldone001> "Them kids and their artist voices!"
[3:33:37] <%Gruhunchously> Yep, definately an artist
[3:33:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[3:33:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> She sounds like she's calling you problematic
[3:33:54] <LeeOhX> her second for is so much easier
[3:33:59] <%Gruhunchously> She's going to cancel you on Twitter
[3:34:00] <%oneimportantthing> Yeyeye
[3:34:11] <%bevyrage> that's pretty sick
[3:34:12] <%Gruhunchously> Last shot
[3:34:13] <DeathByPoke7> it's sick
[3:34:16] <Grim1952> You can also catch the multiple throw
[3:34:29] <+OrangeMDT> @rytyoung right right, I mean I don’t get the issue with this fight. Maybe there’s input delay or added time using two buttons, but the staff attacks seem pretty telegraphed. Like around 6p reachable in fighterz
[3:34:30] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you an parry her big dash attack too if you got the skills
[3:34:33] <DXLelouch24> only done it once
[3:34:37] <DXLelouch24> can*
[3:34:47] <edward0286> You can also dodge her flash step
[3:34:48] <+OrangeMDT> Reactable
[3:35:05] <letshavecakes> You can catch all of them, the timing just needs to be correct
[3:35:14] <%pi_in_the_sci> I just noticed her big stab drops you maximum health
[3:35:19] <emptyantics> What a fucking awesome stage
[3:35:20] <puse9> or go straight to the elevator
[3:35:24] <+theoldone001> 死
[3:35:27] <%RyTYoung> Shrine 1 is the second exhibition, so you can take the stairs to the second floor @woolieversus
[3:35:28] <%ChoculaUltra> oh dope, his sunglasses fell off too
[3:35:38] <%Gruhunchously> The visual design of this game is *perfection*
[3:35:38] <edward0286> Throws are a tap to catch them
[3:35:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is the big one shot stab doing the charged l1 + triangle?
[3:35:49] <gulthrax> seafood
[3:36:10] <%SirGO0SE> wonder if theres anything behind that waterfall Kappa
[3:36:23] <%HeroToxiko> bat says different
[3:36:44] <letshavecakes> Woolie getting folded by early goons
[3:36:49] <%AyotoCorp> Calbot is an instant 5x multiplier
[3:37:08] <%Gruhunchously> Throat slash
[3:37:09] <BurdRightsActivist> Age: 9+10 pog
[3:37:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie is doing the souls thing where you try to rush through
[3:37:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> and then eat it hard bc of it
[3:38:36] <+JustToWatch> you only need to get to 2000 here if you get all 3 of the big points from the 1st 2 levels
[3:38:52] <FloatYourGoat> yo what, i never seen that animation before
[3:38:56] <BurdRightsActivist> I love the contextual takedowns
[3:39:29] <%Gruhunchously> How many times do we have to teach this lesson, old man?
[3:39:47] <%oneimportantthing> @cobalt_phoenix_ this game is like nah son, this isn't Fromsoft
[3:39:49] <muxperience> GUN
[3:39:50] <BurdRightsActivist> Fuckin murdered him
[3:39:55] <+mechslayer71> yeah a few more weapons wouldn't have hurt
[3:40:03] <+rrratbastard> i mean technically you had that one room where you could rapidfire paint lightbulbs at the two people
[3:40:08] <DeathByPoke7> swing a bust around
[3:40:11] <%Gruhunchously> It symbolizes class warfare
[3:40:12] <+mechslayer71> but these are nice, silver bats
[3:40:17] <Treasure_Vault> Even a baton would be nice
[3:40:19] <velgaduere> yeah. they should have guns instead
[3:40:22] <%LastHazzerd> they DO be fancy bats tho
[3:40:27] <+crybirb> Yeah sadly the mokap of this game is super expensive so it would be really hard to do other weapons
[3:40:27] <GiefHoward> back scratcher
[3:40:29] <%Gruhunchously> Man, imagine if people in this game had guns
[3:40:33] <BurdRightsActivist> Man I wish this wasn't on Epic SadMoth
[3:40:38] <%pi_in_the_sci> It's because they're all mobsters protecting an ex-assassin
[3:40:39] <+mechslayer71> so guys, these guys should get to make a john wick game, right?
[3:40:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:40:43] <%IGgy_IGsen> Oh fuc, they probably will get guns eventually
[3:40:47] <emptyantics> They should have those batons that fold in
[3:40:48] <%SuperBloodWolfMoon> SuperBloodWolfMoon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:40:51] <+thedream_c> guns? i mean... we have max payne 3
[3:41:00] <%Gruhunchously> Yes, and...?
[3:41:08] <+thedream_c> but I guess we could use a gun kata like game
[3:41:12] <%IGgy_IGsen> Gut kata
[3:41:16] <%AyotoCorp> This room is great with environment mastery
[3:41:25] <%AyotoCorp> You can just machine gun those lightbulbs
[3:41:29] <+mechslayer71> these are chumps, they're weaker than the others
[3:41:32] <Grim1952> Becaus these guys are lower level
[3:41:32] <%LastHazzerd> are those the same types as the club?
[3:41:46] <DXLelouch24> they nerfed regular enemies too?
[3:41:47] <velgaduere> tbh idk if I'd call this first shrine worth it. I think the only ones worth it on a rerun are the one before the "dream" sequence, and the one right before the boss
[3:42:10] <+thedream_c> but a big part of the novelty of the game is the way its structured with the hand to hand combat
[3:42:15] <+mechslayer71> They're weaker versions
[3:42:45] <velgaduere> oh huh, I forgot there was one this early. I thought there was only one at the end of the exhibit
[3:42:57] <%LastHazzerd> so if you perma unlock things, does it matter if you restart from the begining?
[3:42:58] <GarbageNirvana> Man I'm late to this stream
[3:43:09] <GarbageNirvana> Also didn't know you could be a lady Sifu
[3:43:19] <+thedream_c> SheFu was always an option
[3:43:42] <Alt_Tab_streams> Oh this game is beautiful
[3:43:56] <Alt_Tab_streams> I wasnt expecting how cool this game looks and plays
[3:44:03] <theblackbreath> love when you dont even let them get the chance to get mad
[3:44:14] <%Gruhunchously> BROOOOOM
[3:44:17] <NBUsagi> Never give your enemy the chance to get ready
[3:44:22] <+thedream_c> woolie is strictly business with this run
[3:44:36] <velgaduere> holy camera
[3:44:54] <+thedream_c> the blessing and teh curse of games with 3d combat
[3:44:58] <+vaderxyz1970> Gosh how much product does this girl go through to keep her hair like that
[3:44:59] <FloatYourGoat> woolie has more abilities perma unlocked than me by now lmao
[3:45:17] <+mechslayer71> imma be honest, the knives have cool finishers, but the fact that people just block them with their arms makes them kinda feel like shit, whereas the bats feel great
[3:45:19] <%Gruhunchously> You are not worthy as my opponent
[3:45:20] <+thedream_c> this lady def mid boss status
[3:45:23] <BurdRightsActivist> I like the Shapiro posture bar
[3:45:48] <+mechslayer71> the bar break you down with facts and logic? @burdrightsactivist
[3:45:54] <velgaduere> shrine, and then elevator
[3:45:58] <%oneimportantthing> Sekiro taught me that parry-heavy games without being able to level up enrage me lol
[3:46:03] <+thedream_c> like how people were gate kept with the MT looking guy as a mid boss before shortcuts
[3:46:04] <velgaduere> sure can
[3:46:10] <%oneimportantthing> (Yes i'm shit at these type of games)
[3:46:41] <+thedream_c> funny enough tho dodging is consistently great against most enemies
[3:46:44] <+thedream_c> including bosses
[3:46:44] <velgaduere> maybe it's a magic elevator
[3:46:53] <%Gruhunchously> It's all *illusions*
[3:46:56] <BurdRightsActivist> Iron Keep elevator
[3:47:00] <+thedream_c> the parry value goes away against stronger opponents

[3:48:36] <+rrratbastard> i've been putting off a lot of work today and i am ready to reap the consequences tomorrow lmao
[3:48:38] <NBUsagi> @oneimportantthing dope, just been chilling watching streams
[3:48:47] <+thedream_c> the sploinky survives
[3:48:48] <+thedream_c> another day
[3:48:49] <TheProtomanBlues> @oneimportantthing Been chilling, working on some desings, what about you
[3:48:56] <+yoshkosh20> oh. this song's nice. who's it by?
[3:49:02] <stormhawk9891> Fukkin zeek propaganda
[3:49:09] <NBUsagi> @yoshkosh20 Bottom left corner
[3:49:14] <%SirGO0SE> @oneimportantthing i got sent from floor 9 to floor 8 and feel sad :(
[3:49:15] <%oneimportantthing> @theprotomanblues Had an awful workday, this is how I rewind these days
[3:49:16] <%Shishi1205> Man this song's reminds me of E-dubble
[3:49:16] <+Jiggisnipe> RIP SajamSploinky :(
[3:49:18] <+yoshkosh20> thank you
[3:49:22] <+yoshkosh20> I see it now
[3:49:23] <+eanscrale> the colonies will be FREE one day my fellow spacenoids
[3:49:33] <%ChoculaUltra> that madnug sample from unicorn tho
[3:49:35] <stormhawk9891> That was fast
[3:49:39] <+thedream_c> its possible
[3:49:46] <emptyantics> Ah yes cringe rap
[3:49:47] <+thedream_c> but yeah this boss is a big knowledge check
[3:49:51] <NBUsagi> @yoshkosh20 lol its cool, i took me a second to find it myself. Most streamers who play music have a ticker with the title
[3:49:57] <%Shishi1205> woolieSTRIKE
[3:50:03] <TheProtomanBlues> @oneimportantthing Sure as fuck dont miss working at an office lol what happen
[3:50:17] <+thedream_c> this boss does a helluva good job mixiing strings with fast ass lows
[3:50:20] <emptyantics> KILL BILL STAGE
[3:50:20] <%SirGO0SE> bladder : empty, fists : full
[3:50:25] <+thedream_c> the real low atk check
[3:50:26] <+mechslayer71> he just cut her off, rude D:
[3:50:41] <+Jiggisnipe> bonk
[3:50:42] <%oneimportantthing> @theprotomanblues Some asshat didn't read my email and then blamed me for not sending the email more than once lmao
[3:50:54] <+thedream_c> YES woolie
[3:50:54] <alexandrecau> you don't carry a 3 piece staff for years to not fight
[3:50:57] <Grim1952> I find her easier to parry, don't need to worry about lows
[3:51:24] <+yoshkosh20> structure damage on parry is super useful in this fight.
[3:51:48] <whatatkins> is it weird I found the first phase of the artist the hardest part of the game?
[3:52:03] <%SirGO0SE> ^ive seen this boss streamed more than any part of the game
[3:52:23] <+yoshkosh20> nah man, that up down interchangeable is super disorienting the first couple times.
[3:52:39] <fistynopunches> if you spec into weapon durability and take one into the fight, ive found first form does not like a bat
[3:52:43] <TheProtomanBlues> @oneimportantthing Well that's an easy dispute with cool supervisors but that doesnt sound like its the case here, people that dont accept theis mistakes are the worse
[3:53:05] <FloatYourGoat> yeah, with the bat i beat her first try
[3:53:09] <whatatkins> yeah bat does good for blocking the blades here
[3:53:14] <+FadingEmber> has he made it to a further zone?
[3:53:18] <edward0286> She’s kinda like Sean, but since her pace and patterns are different, it’s a bit weird
[3:53:20] <+thedream_c> oh yeah in 2nd phase if you have the projectile throwback, u have an edge
[3:53:24] <%oneimportantthing> @theprotomanblues I'm sure you know the type. Some people are super bored and drooling for confrontation lol
[3:53:24] <%SirGO0SE> ah so you want a weapon just to mitigate the chip?
[3:53:33] <%Gruhunchously> Say goodbye to your ankles
[3:53:44] <fistynopunches> weapon does cancel chip for mistimed parries yeah
[3:53:50] <whatatkins> I found the bat to be better at blocking than the sword you can also bring
[3:54:03] <%SirGO0SE> nice dodges PogChamp
[3:54:08] <fistynopunches> weapon catch handles second form np
[3:54:10] <+Jiggisnipe> those dodges tho
[3:54:10] <+thedream_c> woolie has the right idea there
[3:54:18] <%Pillagius> I see the download is almost complete, huh?
[3:54:19] <+yoshkosh20> it's like a weapon keeps the blade staff from cuttin your forearms. it's kinda neat.
[3:54:20] <FloatYourGoat> nice
[3:54:27] <%SirGO0SE> woolieYE give em the business woolieYE
[3:54:28] <+thedream_c> get her on combo, get the takedown and the reset than do the focus on her
[3:54:28] <NBUsagi> Getting better
[3:54:34] <FloatYourGoat> u got this
[3:54:52] <+thedream_c> yeah
[3:54:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:54:54] <%Gruhunchously> oof
[3:55:03] <+thedream_c> if u have the throwback u can retaliate back ez
[3:55:17] <TheProtomanBlues> @oneimportantthing Yeah, used to be team leader, always tried to be cool and helpull to my team, you know working for them not them for me, but there was this ONE girl, just wanted to strat shit every day, my only termination in all my years
[3:55:18] <NBUsagi> The fact your on the second phase and not 40 is a huge improvement though
[3:55:45] <Invess> stinger
[3:55:46] <%SirGO0SE> damn she was right
[3:55:49] <AngryAsian5> She wasn't lying LUL
[3:55:50] <%Pillagius> called it :D
[3:55:54] <%Gruhunchously> She wasn't lying
[3:56:03] <+thedream_c> yeah buying 10 years against her is solid on phase 2
[3:56:20] <Invess> You went from '16er to '09er
[3:56:36] <%kyh9> YEYEYEYE
[3:56:38] <+thedream_c> yeah phase 2 flows better
[3:56:41] <+thedream_c> aaah
[3:56:42] <%Gruhunchously> Yer donig good
[3:56:44] <%Gruhunchously> nevermind
[3:56:47] <%Pillagius> x2 called!
[3:56:49] <ohno58> dat stinger tho
[3:56:49] <%SirGO0SE> she cant keep getting away with this NotLikeThis
[3:56:50] <+mechslayer71> NOT A LIE TOLD
[3:56:55] <AngryAsian5> She's getting good with the call outs LUL
[3:56:58] <whatatkins> her spam attacks are very rhythmic to the point where you can very easily just dodge under
[3:56:59] <TheProtomanBlues> Two times
[3:57:04] <majindusto> SHE CALLED IT AGAIN enigmaKEK
[3:57:09] <BlackermanZX> still good
[3:57:12] <+TomosukeUsagi> monkaS
[3:57:16] <NBUsagi> he is learning it, i think Woolie will get it
[3:57:19] <+mechslayer71> 40 WutFace
[3:57:21] <FloatYourGoat> ok.....
[3:57:24] <BlackermanZX> well shit
[3:57:30] <Invess> 3rd strike player now
[3:57:31] <MAX116030> is he trying to parry it? Cuz dodge is way easier
[3:57:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey not bad
[3:57:47] <+mechslayer71> better than 53 tho
[3:57:49] <letshavecakes> There is literally a bright flash right before it comes out
[3:57:50] <+mechslayer71> 40
[3:57:53] <BlackermanZX> stabby stabby
[3:57:53] <velgaduere> 40
[3:57:55] <%pi_in_the_sci> better then 53
[3:57:57] <+thedream_c> woolie went from 25 to 40 in that fight?
[3:58:00] <+Jiggisnipe> 40
[3:58:01] <+thedream_c> pretty nice
[3:58:03] <%RyTYoung> That’s good!
[3:58:03] <Play_UN_Squadron> 40
[3:58:05] <+mechslayer71> you died
[3:58:06] <velgaduere> you're 40
[3:58:07] <+Jiggisnipe> not 53 tho
[3:58:11] <MAX116030> a tip real [unish comes from heavy not light
[3:58:13] <ohno58> lordy lordy look who's forty
[3:58:15] <NBUsagi> Yeah way younger than you were last time
[3:58:17] <+thedream_c> just gota optimize for the boss fight
[3:58:19] <%SirGO0SE> sometimes in life we have to settle
[3:58:24] <+Jiggisnipe> run it again
[3:58:30] <+thedream_c> becvause she threw you for a loop on phase 1 and 2 adjsutments
[3:58:33] <+SammyOVision> 13 more years is more time to explore the tower
[3:58:33] <+eanscrale> Isn't that the truth
[3:58:33] <%Gruhunchously> Four Presidencies, damn
[3:58:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Wax on Wax off
[3:58:41] <NBUsagi> Optimize the run Woolzuto
[3:58:44] <majindusto> TIME FOR RUNBACK
[3:58:45] <TheProtomanBlues> Tell myself that every morning, "Not as young as i'd like"
[3:58:48] <jubejube56> Just means you could fight the old lady as an old lady
[3:58:49] <+DeadManProp> Happy 40th Woolie!
[3:59:19] <+mechslayer71> you can permanently unlock regardless of age
[3:59:37] <letshavecakes> It is, you just bought one already
[3:59:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus idk about calbot, but in general if you unlock it once in a run, you can keep permaunlocking it even if you are older
[4:00:00] <%pi_in_the_sci> Once you unlock it, it doesn't age out
[4:00:29] <Treasure_Vault> Try bringing a bat at her
[4:01:05] <+thedream_c> Mmm
[4:01:45] <+mechslayer71> liveleak hours huh
[4:01:48] <%kyh9> But that would be too easy
[4:01:50] <+thedream_c> as much as you wanna be dishonorable, she still fights honorable :(
[4:01:52] <%kyh9> Game wouldnt be as fun
[4:01:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[4:02:07] <velgaduere> those could've been two ground stabs, but no
[4:02:15] <TheProtomanBlues> Shank them on the floor
[4:02:31] <velgaduere> gotta murder """honorably"""
[4:02:32] <%pi_in_the_sci> through the second exhibit for the first shrine
[4:02:39] <+thedream_c> oh yeah midboss
[4:02:51] <muxperience> you gotta punch them twice then put them back on their feet. for honor
[4:02:55] <%Gruhunchously> She's so polite...she just wants to help you find the exit
[4:03:06] <+thedream_c> good idea
[4:03:08] <+RegularCore> shank
[4:03:08] <velgaduere> nice
[4:03:10] <%Gruhunchously> SHANKED
[4:03:21] <+thedream_c> not playin around, gotta show whose the boss
[4:03:27] <velgaduere> can you go past her to get another shrine?
[4:03:29] <+RegularCore> we ain't playing in these streets
[4:03:34] <%Gruhunchously> Brought a knife to a stick fight
[4:03:37] <%pi_in_the_sci> first shrine is on second floor
[4:03:45] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> The Pole otg sweep cheese strat didn't get patched out
[4:03:54] <+SammyOVision> You can probably go backwards down the stairs to get to the shrine at the end
[4:04:05] <majindusto> Dat Tunnel Vision enigmaKEK
[4:04:11] <+mechslayer71> wish absolver had better single player content, it was cool as hell
[4:04:12] <%Pillagius> Well, it's only a huge painting - not like it's an easy to notice thing
[4:04:29] <StarlitStunner> sputWrite sputThink
[4:04:51] <misterbigshot2> pulling back on stick dodges left right and back
[4:05:08] <edward0286> If you have the key, you can go right to the boss from the first floor
[4:05:17] <jubejube56> If you want to get through that Sean’s disciples section faster you can throw  20 lightbulbs at them
[4:05:22] <jubejube56> Makes quick work of the room
[4:05:28] <fistynopunches> environment mastery in that room lets you rapid fire lightbulbs at those 2
[4:05:32] <NBUsagi> I wonder what would happen if you got a hard stab off on the first phase?
[4:05:37] <%Gruhunchously> Everyone walk the dinosaur
[4:05:46] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Just throw the paint lightbulbs at them
[4:05:49] <velgaduere> bopped
[4:05:50] <SoaringTrumpet> nice
[4:06:10] <TheProtomanBlues> Should have finisher healed
[4:06:12] <+SammyOVision> Weapon catch first.
[4:06:13] <velgaduere> you're 21
[4:06:54] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You can't
[4:07:20] <+mechslayer71> you know, it's odd that kuroki claims to have left her past of violence behind, but is still surrounded by Yakuza with tantos and bats
[4:07:37] <+mechslayer71> who attack on sight
[4:07:51] <velgaduere> knife + meter
[4:07:55] <%Gruhunchously> Well, to be fair, they recognize you
[4:07:57] <muxperience> there's a kungfu maniac on a rampage, take no chances
[4:08:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Art must be protected at all costs
[4:08:06] <edward0286> @mechslayer71 if you’ve been to her room in the museum, it would make sense
[4:08:07] <letshavecakes> @mechslayer71 You've just murder hobo'd your way through the two previous levels all day, so it's a fair reaction
[4:08:29] <+thedream_c> there u go
[4:08:33] <+thedream_c> weapons xpert
[4:08:33] <+mechslayer71> @edward0286 haven't found that key yet. what level is it on?
[4:08:35] <Treasure_Vault> Now, I elevate
[4:08:35] <boogz____> Has woolie met the boss of this level yet?
[4:08:41] <+thedream_c> yes he has
[4:08:43] <letshavecakes> @mechslayer71 Final
[4:08:45] <+thedream_c> he's tryign to optimize it
[4:08:58] <+mechslayer71> @letshavecakes I'll have to looks around, thanks
[4:08:59] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:09:08] <boogz____> Gotcha, that’s where the fun begins Kappa
[4:09:09] <%Gruhunchously> If a gal who just rampaged through two of your friend's places of residence and killed them showed up on your doorstep, you'd probably attack them on sight as well
[4:09:14] <+vaderxyz1970> This museum has a mold and mildew problem
[4:09:19] <NBUsagi> Man, imagine your just going ot the museum and you hit the wrong button. Now your in the finale from Kill Bill Part 1
[4:09:30] <letshavecakes> @mechslayer71 Oh wait no, I was thinking of one of the other ones, it's actually on tower
[4:09:52] <edward0286> @mechslayer71 it may be a last level thing, I’d have to check again. Ik Fajar’s key is in the last level
[4:10:10] <+mechslayer71> @edward0286 yeah I got his
[4:10:11] <buffany> I like the idea of charging into a serenity garden with a bat just ready to wreck some shit
[4:10:29] <edward0286> @mechslayer71 right you have to hack the computer in the tower for it
[4:10:30] <NBUsagi> He whole combo is jus tmix
[4:10:30] <+mechslayer71> @letshavecakes is it in the safe? if so I already got it
[4:10:34] <velgaduere> @buffany a magical one nonetheless, with a mundane weapon
[4:10:42] <%kyh9> gg
[4:10:44] <letshavecakes> @mechslayer71 ye
[4:10:51] <+Xx_HD_xX> Yeah telegraphing her is just...ugh
[4:10:51] <%SirGO0SE> I feel like when you get it down you arent going to get hit once
[4:10:56] <+redjack108> This boss is so cool.
[4:10:57] <+mechslayer71> yeah I would just keep my distance till I see something I recognize
[4:11:05] <boogz____> She’s honestly the hardest boss IMO so don’t feel bad
[4:11:05] <aawnlvado> That spinning barrage is all dodgable for free focus
[4:11:11] <+mechslayer71> @letshavecakes okay I got it, just haven't gone back there since
[4:11:28] <velgaduere> side evade
[4:11:34] <%AyotoCorp> If you normal block the first hit, you take some chip but it gives you time to recognize the attack pattern
[4:11:35] <+Xx_HD_xX> Yeah sidestep
[4:11:38] <+vaderxyz1970> GUN
[4:11:41] <+FoxLex_> You can mash dodge
[4:11:46] <Grim1952> Parry the sweeps dodge the verticals
[4:11:46] <Gadagast> yeah this lady baits you so hard to use avoid because it looks like you have to but just parrying is actually solid here
[4:11:48] <letshavecakes> Has woolie not learned sweep dodges
[4:11:49] <velgaduere> the vertical is a combo finisher
[4:11:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can dodge it like a high attack
[4:11:56] <fistynopunches> rt is bad
[4:12:10] <jubejube56> The final attack can be high weaved but it’s delayed, basically once you hear the staff hit the ground dodge
[4:12:17] <+Setos1> youre right rt is bad
[4:12:17] <%RyTYoung> L1 and dodge is the way
[4:12:18] <+FoxLex_> You have to use regular dodge
[4:12:25] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus take no damage if you parry bladed weaponsvwith a knife
[4:12:28] <edward0286> Side dodge is for any overhead
[4:12:31] <DXLelouch24> with*
[4:12:45] <xbb1024> hello
[4:12:47] <DXLelouch24> glowing is a guard break
[4:12:53] <DXLelouch24> dodge or parry
[4:12:56] <+Xx_HD_xX> I felt the same. Close dodge not working isn't working nor parry not working is confusing
[4:12:57] <Grim1952> The jumping vertical is easy to L1 down
[4:13:09] <+ArcanumArcanum> the answer isn't always parry if an attack isn't glowing
[4:13:28] <+FoxLex_> Not everything is parryable
[4:13:41] <DXLelouch24> i parried her with a knife in my hands so no you can parry all her phase 1 shit
[4:13:45] <brandonmani456> This game's awesome!
[4:14:06] <brandonmani456> This game's gonna sell a LOT.
[4:14:08] <misterbigshot2> dodge and reading moves is key for this and most fights in the game
[4:14:12] <+FoxLex_> Also the game only has 2 way dodging
[4:14:22] <+FoxLex_> Down dodges everything but lows
[4:14:28] <+FoxLex_> Up dodges only lows
[4:14:30] <misterbigshot2> yes foxlex
[4:14:43] <xbb1024> are we trying for a perfect run?
[4:14:44] <misterbigshot2> but they're  not reading chat
[4:14:53] <DXLelouch24> knife in hand to parry and 2 parry impact upgrades and it was gg
[4:15:03] <velgaduere> @misterbigshot2 they are, when they choose to
[4:15:10] <DXLelouch24> parry impact obliterates their bar
[4:15:16] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Feels bad man
[4:15:26] <letshavecakes> Yeah parries are a bad idea against her
[4:15:36] <DXLelouch24> barehanded yes
[4:15:42] <DXLelouch24> but with a knife you take no damage
[4:15:43] <+Xx_HD_xX> I feel perfect parry is the only way for her practically speaking
[4:15:44] <WallabyInertia> It’s kinda nice seeing them trying to learn it
[4:15:46] <SoaringTrumpet> they go high you go low :)
[4:15:54] <misterbigshot2> I hope they see our messages because it really would help them
[4:16:01] <+Shoryo_Tori> Yeah, in my runs against her, ground parry never worked
[4:16:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:16:17] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Phase 2 is so much more manageable
[4:16:24] <DXLelouch24> that one is HARD to parry
[4:16:25] <%kyh9> yeoch
[4:16:28] <DXLelouch24> only did it ONCE
[4:16:32] <misterbigshot2> game came way easier for me once I realized there's really only 2 dodges
[4:16:42] <DXLelouch24> still dont know how i did
[4:16:43] <velgaduere> when she charges up, the thing I've seen work best is dodge
[4:16:49] <VincentGraves> just got my booster, feels good man
[4:16:54] <letshavecakes> The flash woolie, the flash. Don't wait for her to move
[4:17:07] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus parry that attack when she flashes

[4:17:22] <+Xx_HD_xX> That use is good for l1 dodge
[4:17:35] <letshavecakes> SHE FLASHES BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT
[4:17:36] <+mechslayer71> I just got the timing down, with the flash she gives off
[4:17:39] <DXLelouch24> i know it can be parried ive done it
[4:17:45] <fistynopunches> have they done level 4 chat?
[4:17:45] <boogz____> There’s a big flash on her to tell ya
[4:17:46] <Grim1952> Look for the glint
[4:17:47] <DXLelouch24> shes big open after
[4:18:02] <+Xx_HD_xX> @DXLelouch24 what were your shrine upgrades?
[4:18:08] <+mechslayer71> @fistynopunches a bit of it, but he's getting his age down so he can complete it
[4:18:09] <+trackles_64> i cant beat this bosss under 40
[4:18:25] <+Xx_HD_xX> oh nevermind, be puled it o9ff
[4:19:03] <+mechslayer71> this second phase is great, sekiro type shit
[4:19:05] <DXLelouch24> second swallow
[4:19:06] <aawnlvado> She doesn’t have any lows so you can basically spam avoid
[4:19:10] <FassieFons> health down, drip up
[4:19:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I beat her at 25... but I still feel like I can do better... Mind goblins man
[4:19:31] <BlackermanZX> the catch is pretty cool
[4:19:51] <velgaduere> she only staggers after the kunai return throw SOMETIMES, for some reason
[4:19:57] <%kyh9> yo
[4:19:57] <AngryAsian5> Nice
[4:19:59] <%kyh9> YOOOO
[4:19:59] <+Xx_HD_xX> You got it man
[4:19:59] <ohno58> Downloaded
[4:19:59] <SoaringTrumpet> KomodoHype
[4:20:01] <jetstreamlove_R> You can catch all the knives aka, disrespect her nindo way
[4:20:08] <%kyh9> Got her
[4:20:11] <velgaduere> yeah she has zero low attacks, phase 2 can be R2 dodge spammed
[4:20:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what's the youngest he's done this?
[4:20:16] <%kyh9> Bitch, your mascara is running
[4:20:18] <letshavecakes> @velgaduere It's some kind of hidden stun meter, I'm sure
[4:20:21] <+trackles_64> now we old
[4:20:25] <+yoshkosh20> I actually felt really bad killing her.
[4:20:33] <fistynopunches> she staggers after about 3 kunai hits
[4:20:37] <edward0286> Huh? A focus can stop her instant dash… interesting
[4:20:41] <T_Sasquatch> Nah just spam dodge LUL
[4:20:42] <+Xx_HD_xX> Should any of us tell him about the cheese for phase 1?
[4:20:43] <fistynopunches> might be 4
[4:20:43] <Renegadorade> @yoshkosh20 Ya didn't havee to do that
[4:20:45] <letshavecakes> Literally just run away until she does strings you know
[4:21:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> technically no
[4:21:13] <misterbigshot2> 2 directions
[4:21:14] <%pi_in_the_sci> She can't block the groin strike in that first phase
[4:21:16] <+yoshkosh20> @Renegadorade I know. I actually felt bad enough to google if there were alternate ways to take down the bosses. BibleThump
[4:21:19] <letshavecakes> The regular avoid works on her vertical attack, timing is just bad
[4:21:20] <jetstreamlove_R> This woman literally aging ya 20 years ahead LUL
[4:21:23] <velgaduere> @yoshkosh20 nah she turned on your dad while was killed, and then turned a blind eye while machete man killed you. she deserves it
[4:21:25] <misterbigshot2> stick up and stick, down avoids
[4:21:30] <+FoxLex_> Low avoids sides
[4:21:31] <@Menitta> How far they are?
[4:21:36] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> memorise the difference, avoid until you recognise which one it is then jump in like double dutch
[4:21:41] <ZeeJiggle> Yeah, left and right are the same as down.
[4:21:47] <jetstreamlove_R> she takes two arcades coins to win
[4:21:54] <+yoshkosh20> @velgaduere it was the accusing stare as she bled out.
[4:21:55] <%Pillagius> Hmm... you could try just keeping close but outside of the boss range as she attacks, and then go in
[4:21:55] <+Setos1> 90 percent of avoids in game are high side is just visuaally diffeent forms of high dodge
[4:21:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Menitta partway through stage 4 but went back to 3 to lower age
[4:22:08] <@Menitta> Cool thanks!
[4:22:13] <velgaduere> @yoshkosh20 there's a reason for that, but you gotta get later in the game to see why
[4:22:17] <%pi_in_the_sci> try though
[4:22:21] <Treasure_Vault> Might as well museum while it's fresh
[4:22:32] <letshavecakes> Once again, age is largely irrelevant compared to death count
[4:22:32] <misterbigshot2> you can do this woolie
[4:22:33] <BlackermanZX> the lab is always open
[4:22:34] <LimitBreak_J> all hail the lab

[4:23:26] <Renegadorade> Ringht on the D-pad to taunt
[4:23:37] <%Gruhunchously> I like how she just casually thorat slashes people
[4:23:38] <metalgearsandmann> cant you find it in obs?
[4:23:47] <velgaduere> just don't kill her at too low an age
[4:23:47] <NBUsagi> Oh we boss Lab
[4:23:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just don't ace it this time lol
[4:23:56] <+yoshkosh20> a neat little thing, is that the taunts change the older you get.
[4:23:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> @velgaduere but then it'd block Kirby
[4:24:10] <ZeeJiggle> I reckon they expected this to be the wall, rather than Sean.
[4:24:14] <velgaduere> @ReallyBigRocks Kirby would understand
[4:24:26] <letshavecakes> Even Yang doesn't get a direct shortcut with no further enemy encounters lmao
[4:24:27] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[4:24:34] <ZeeJiggle> Cute lol
[4:24:34] <AngryAsian5> Both?
[4:24:40] <jetstreamlove_R> I mean she do be dancing
[4:24:43] <+Xx_HD_xX> I never heard that lol
[4:24:50] <velgaduere> 🎶 are we fighting, or are we dancer? 🎶
[4:25:10] <T_Sasquatch> That's not working LUL
[4:25:11] <jetstreamlove_R> that one always a slam
[4:25:15] <BlackermanZX> loosing too much structure
[4:25:25] <BlackermanZX> avoiding shit seems better
[4:25:25] <+trackles_64> Death
[4:25:32] <jetstreamlove_R> right in the jaw!
[4:25:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oohhh i can taste the salt
[4:25:39] <+trackles_64> L1 to Dodge XD
[4:25:46] <jubejube56> She won’t be punishable on most strings unless you avoid them
[4:25:50] <+mechslayer71> yep, happened to me SO MANY TIMES
[4:25:50] <OblivionSword1> yeah I feel that
[4:25:51] <AngryAsian5> Girl's a blender
[4:26:00] <SaiyanShoto> I just guess with this boss and rush her down. I can’t read her shit LUL LUL
[4:26:01] <+Xx_HD_xX> This weapon.....it's new to the gaming spectrum LUL
[4:26:02] <Invess> spookyMix
[4:26:11] <letshavecakes> You can rush in for the opening after the high/low/high/low, and also go in after the longer high/low mixup to avoid the vertical strike and punish
[4:26:12] <+theoldone001> 20's at the boss is great though
[4:26:15] <%Gruhunchously> Insight Gained

[4:27:05] <Exeerdna> The download is getting that boost
[4:27:13] <jubejube56> Lol Reggie with the confusion strats “high low dodge low high low low”?
[4:27:17] <%Gruhunchously> Yer doing it!
[4:27:23] <T_Sasquatch> FINALLY
[4:27:28] <radiorosewater> YES
[4:27:28] <%RyTYoung> YES
[4:27:29] <T_Sasquatch> Just spam lmao
[4:27:32] <letshavecakes> And that's her most bullshit attack, too
[4:27:33] <OblivionSword1> the game treats vertical overhead as high attack
[4:27:37] <radiorosewater> FUCK YEAH
[4:27:41] <+Xx_HD_xX> Downdodge is kinda forgiving
[4:27:48] <xerotwo> SHAWWWWWWWWN!!!!!!
[4:27:50] <xbb1024> cool, good to know
[4:27:57] <velgaduere> the windmill gets down dodge spammed

[4:28:21] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[4:28:24] <T_Sasquatch> We God HAND BABY
[4:28:25] <+FoxLex_> Did he figure it out on his own?
[4:28:30] <%RyTYoung> You can mash parry too
[4:28:31] <letshavecakes> If you're fast enough or on keyboard, you can literally dodge both directions at once
[4:28:41] <+Xx_HD_xX> @RyTYoung that's waht I do
[4:28:49] <velgaduere> M*A*S*H
[4:28:58] <NBUsagi> 24 isnt bad
[4:29:03] <%RyTYoung> @xx_hd_xx I feel like I’m playing sekiro when I do LUL
[4:29:06] <SaiyanShoto> Mashing is what got me through a lot of fights LUL
[4:29:24] <zerointelligence000> I honestly feel like her phase 2 is easier than 1
[4:29:28] <zerointelligence000> which is weird
[4:29:33] <%RyTYoung> Same here
[4:29:33] <+Xx_HD_xX> @RyTYoung Right? That's exactly what it feels like "clack clack clack" "pary parry parry"
[4:29:34] <%Gruhunchously> I think you do that three times to stagger her
[4:29:35] <jetstreamlove_R> 100 ways to kill ya, is the most straightforward face
[4:29:40] <letshavecakes> oof
[4:29:41] <+yoshkosh20> you should just let her come to you. that lil' kunai flick basically has no tells.
[4:29:44] <0078thunder> @zerointelligence000 every boss 2nd phase is easier besides sean IMO
[4:29:47] <FloatYourGoat> just stand still pretty much
[4:29:51] <%LastHazzerd> a second in the shadow of the original!?
[4:29:54] <Exeerdna> ayo that was slick
[4:30:07] <%RyTYoung> If this game had mikiri counters I’d cry NotLikeThis
[4:30:10] <jetstreamlove_R> can you even parry that stinger of hers?
[4:30:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19

[4:31:06] <NBUsagi> Yooo that was smooth
[4:31:13] <letshavecakes> This phase should be free, maybe woolie is just more used to bullshit
[4:31:18] <HotSauceFiend> I cant believe that PAt already fully completed this whole game. It seems difficult'
[4:31:21] <DSD24> I love that catch
[4:31:30] <%VladVandal> after the downed hits, it seems like the protag picks up her enemy to fight more. its awesome
[4:31:47] <jetstreamlove_R> and she did
[4:31:54] <velgaduere> I can't tell if he's trying to dodge or parry the flash moves
[4:32:01] <letshavecakes> @HotSauceFiend That's because he did the whole damn thing off-stream
[4:32:27] <Estuko> LUL
[4:32:27] <%Gruhunchously> Wax on Wax off

[4:35:17] <jumpyhugs> is this Woolie's first Sifu day?
[4:35:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie just chuck the lightbulbs
[4:35:24] <boogz____> My fav fight is with these disciples because you can just spam the lightbulbs at them
[4:35:26] <+mechslayer71> THEY BEAT THE STAB, FASTER STARTUP PogChamp
[4:35:26] <letshavecakes> Folded like the laundry
[4:35:36] <velgaduere> @jumpyhugs day 2 of streaming, but there was off-screen practice

[4:35:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> throw lightbulb
[4:35:50] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[4:35:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WOOLIE
[4:35:59] <FloatYourGoat> he says in that room...
[4:36:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the lightbulbs tho
[4:36:04] <letshavecakes> You can literally kick any weapon, which they all carry
[4:36:06] <boogz____> Lightbulbs….
[4:36:09] <+mechslayer71> while in the room full of light bulbs
[4:36:09] <+FoxLex_> No it's there
[4:36:09] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[4:36:10] <velgaduere> "fine"
[4:36:10] <jubejube56> Woolie that room is literally an environmental mastery room
[4:36:10] <DSD24> oooo I never saw that kill
[4:36:11] <SaiyanShoto> I feel I got ripped off by it mainly cause the enemies always dodge
[4:36:12] <+viredae> the weapons too
[4:36:13] <%Gruhunchously> Lightbulbs
[4:36:18] <ZeeJiggle> Yeah but that's not about the skill. Yeah.
[4:36:19] <velgaduere> Crazy Talk activate
[4:36:19] <Xeno351> could just grind the exp LUL
[4:36:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok yes that part is true
[4:36:26] <OblivionSword1> you can R1 the lightbulbs as well
[4:36:27] <TigerClaws12> you can R1 the lightbulbs no?
[4:36:27] <+mechslayer71> well yeah that's not there
[4:36:29] <ハクア> the lightbulbs make that room trivial
[4:36:32] <@Menitta> I love the lightbulbs
[4:36:37] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus you can r1 kick those bulbs at then and spam it and it decimates them
[4:36:41] <+Xx_HD_xX> The bosses by the 2nd level knew of your skills & then replaced all of the furniture "lore" LUL
[4:36:42] <DXLelouch24> them*
[4:36:45] <HotSauceFiend> but is that mechanic considered a crutch to be taken away?
[4:36:46] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Well you can throw dropped weapons
[4:36:47] <OblivionSword1> the lightbulbs works with environmental mastery
[4:36:49] <letshavecakes> environmental mastery is not just for furniture
[4:36:51] <DSD24> Murder
[4:36:58] <DSD24> I love that kick into stab
[4:36:58] <+mechslayer71> that's the most brutal one, easy
[4:37:01] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Every other enemy in level 3-5 has a weapon you can kick
[4:37:05] <DXLelouch24> @HotSauceFiend no honor in THIS DOJO
[4:37:08] <DXLelouch24> REVENGE
[4:37:11] <%hax_metatron> I mean yeah overall the game puts its best foot forward — I felt the same, really excited at first, “Meh”, by the end.
[4:37:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:37:12] <DSD24> Kuroki needs more sofas
[4:37:17] <OblivionSword1> weapons can also be kicked
[4:37:20] <ZeeJiggle> Yeah they're definitely much more sparse.
[4:37:22] <NBUsagi> What if you can kick the table at Kuroki
[4:37:23] <velgaduere> well I guess now you gotta think outside the box
[4:37:37] <SomeAsianDood> Yeah the knockdown is strong af so they lower the amount
[4:37:38] <+Xx_HD_xX> "Why are there no foot rests in this museum?"
[4:37:44] <letshavecakes> Mod that just litters the final boss arena with chairs
[4:37:47] <Xeno351> what if you drop your weapon and kick it at them
[4:37:47] <OblivionSword1> but yeah the tower is very sparse with kickable objects
[4:37:48] <+TheOlMitcheroo> Nothing is stopping you from kicking that baseball bat at the dude

[4:39:01] <SomeAsianDood> it sure does hurt them
[4:39:03] <SomeAsianDood> it's just weird
[4:39:05] <letshavecakes> If you got hit with a lightbulb full of paint all over your face, don't act like you wouldn't get your shit pushed in
[4:39:06] <ZeeJiggle> I don't think it damages, but definitely stuns lol

[4:39:45] <ZeeJiggle> HE DDOGED THE STAB
[4:39:49] <ZeeJiggle> HE WAS READY
[4:39:57] <DSD24> I like throwing people in this game
[4:40:08] <@Menitta> "What piece of art is this" "it's a knife."
[4:40:23] <+machinetoys> do the sharp weapons heal less?
[4:40:24] <+Xx_HD_xX> Where does all taht paint coemf rom I wonder
[4:40:26] <%Gruhunchously> Shank her
[4:40:31] <DSD24> Eyy its the cool lady
[4:40:34] <letshavecakes> Focus seems like a really wasted mechanic, there are so few moves for it, and none of them really surpass the default one in terms of usefulness for the cost
[4:40:35] <DSD24> Aww
[4:40:36] <velgaduere> lmfao
[4:40:39] <%LastHazzerd> handled

[4:40:52] <%Lion_kun> If you bring a knife to a boss, does that work lol
[4:41:00] <+viredae> by the way, if you just want to lab the boss, you can use the elevator in the middle to shortcut to her.
[4:41:01] <DSD24> @GunneryGoblin she's got such a cool design
[4:41:02] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus ends minibosses too, that was a miniboss
[4:41:06] <ZeeJiggle> @letshavecakes I think it's the fact that you need to pay XP at a shrine to get more bars that hurts it most.
[4:41:08] <DXLelouch24> all glowing enemies are minibosses
[4:41:10] <+rhyscawlpys> rhyscawlpys subscribed with Prime. 
[4:41:12] <+JustToWatch> @Lion_kun no, and I tried
[4:41:18] <%Lion_kun> haha
[4:41:36] <letshavecakes> @ZeeJiggle Oh yeah, absolutely, if not for that then the other moves would at least be nice for variety
[4:41:37] <DXLelouch24> @Lion_kun look up Kuroki cheese on youtube
[4:41:47] <DXLelouch24> with knife you can basically one shot her
[4:41:49] <+JustToWatch> I found raining strikes to be verey helpful with bosses
[4:41:56] <DSD24> There's that one thigh cut move that needs three bars
[4:42:02] <alroy909> "the knife is like an iceberg, most of it is hidden deep in your stomach"
[4:42:07] <DSD24> and I'm like "Thats so much resources for one move"
[4:42:08] <+Xx_HD_xX> @DXLelouch24 well nota  one shot. more spam
[4:42:12] <velgaduere> yeah the knife super is EXTREMELY expensive
[4:42:14] <DXLelouch24> close enough
[4:42:30] <letshavecakes> And the only upside to it is big damage lmao
[4:42:41] <speximillian> Big damage though
[4:42:56] <%Gruhunchously> A N G E R
[4:43:00] <%Gruhunchously> R A G E
[4:43:08] <ZeeJiggle> Big damage sure, but then I'm just like "charge stab dead true combo"
[4:43:12] <%Lion_kun> I'm still confused about shrines, are they permanent upgrades or not?
[4:43:17] <%RyTYoung> L O S S
[4:43:23] <DSD24> Oh no the staff is gone
[4:43:27] <jubejube56> Shrines are “run upgrades “
[4:43:32] <letshavecakes> @Lion_kun Permanent for every further level, but you can redo levels
[4:43:40] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:43:41] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:43:43] <velgaduere> white button prompt on item lost in SNOW
[4:43:46] <FloatYourGoat> lost in the snow
[4:43:47] <%RyTYoung> A N G E R
[4:43:51] <theblackbreath> that was fuunny
[4:43:54] <%VladVandal> the secret technique
[4:43:54] <%Lion_kun> so in one run, all the shrine upgrades you unlock stick?
[4:43:58] <%Lion_kun> that's pretty good
[4:44:11] <DSD24> Kuroki has a cool design
[4:44:11] <%Gruhunchously> damn it
[4:44:16] <velgaduere> @Lion_kun if you win and keep that run
[4:44:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:44:25] <+viredae> I REALLY hate this boss
[4:44:33] <speximillian> Windmill
[4:44:36] <zerointelligence000> I feel like the sprint sweep would fuck her up but I haven't tried it yet
[4:44:42] <%Lion_kun> @velgaduere So if you die, you lose your upgrades?
[4:44:43] <jubejube56> Yeah when she does that pose it’s always a high into a low
[4:44:44] <%Lion_kun> That sucks
[4:44:50] <speximillian> She learning
[4:44:51] <velgaduere> @zerointelligence000 she doesn't seem to care about sweeps in general
[4:45:03] <DSD24> Spin a roonie
[4:45:13] <%Gruhunchously> Show-off
[4:45:13] <BlackermanZX> a true Axl player
[4:45:15] <zerointelligence000> she's a zoner lmao
[4:45:17] <+Xx_HD_xX> @Lion_kun they revert to where they left off on the last level you beat
[4:45:20] <ZeeJiggle> Doin special far away, just chargin meter.
[4:45:21] <FloatYourGoat> going good, I hope he doesn't overthink phase 2 again
[4:45:31] <velgaduere> @Lion_kun yeah, the only things that permanently count in any sense are your current age when you beat a run, and the number of times you've bought xp skills/permanently unlocked xp skill
[4:45:33] <%Gruhunchously> oof
[4:45:33] <letshavecakes> oof
[4:45:38] <BlackermanZX> missed the staff on the ground
[4:45:39] <DSD24> That 360 staff move is good though
[4:45:50] <ZeeJiggle> I'm sure it is but fukkin good luck finding it
[4:45:54] <+Exicuren> That boss is playing dark souls, just r1, r1, r1
[4:45:54] <velgaduere> it's... in a place
[4:45:56] <speximillian> Treat it like a Punch Out boss
[4:45:58] <%Lion_kun> @Xx_HD_xX Okay, that's much better
[4:46:02] <haisho> getting some major 'Fighting Eddie Gordo' vibes
[4:46:04] <KaiserMario> Zasalamel always had a good moveset

[4:50:34] <DSD24> @buffany I know I was thinking of the harshest thing to say cause its funny
[4:50:40] <BlackermanZX> is it
[4:50:41] <letshavecakes> raining strikes is really satisfying to land for how simple it is

[4:56:14] <+Jiggisnipe> yea he started the tower
[4:56:17] <+mechslayer71> @t_sasquatch surely you jest?
[4:56:22] <T_Sasquatch> Elden ring is gonna be hilarious
[4:56:37] <%RyTYoung> This game is incredible
[4:56:44] <+viredae> Sekiro is the closest to this
[4:56:51] <%LastHazzerd> it's much more grounded... literally
[4:56:53] <+Xx_HD_xX> Sekiro meets arkham LUL
[4:56:59] <@Menitta> it's a lot tighter than Sekiro I feel
[4:56:59] <+mechslayer71> it's a lot tighter in terms of content, for sure
[4:57:11] <+mechslayer71> very little fat
[4:57:12] <+Jiggisnipe> evolution of the beat em up
[4:57:13] <%LastHazzerd> more focused
[4:57:15] <Quite_Dapper> It feels like a much more grounded DmC5
[4:57:16] <T_Sasquatch> @mechslayer71 i would get triggered reading chat after every fail
[4:57:17] <BlackermanZX> Hades a lil bit
[4:57:21] <@Menitta> Ghost runner was up there for me
[4:57:23] <+viredae> yup, it's straight to the good stuff
[4:57:26] <@Menitta> yeye
[4:57:28] <thackattack00> This game reminds me a lot of Furi, just in its general structure.
[4:57:31] <SomeAsianDood> Speaking of katana0 can't wait for the DLC
[4:57:38] <%AyotoCorp> DMCV?
[4:57:41] <+mechslayer71> @t_sasquatch I read that comment wrong my bad, LUL
[4:57:52] <@Solidus_113> no
[4:57:56] <%LastHazzerd> so i don't quite understand, what exactly happens when you beat a level at age 20?
[4:58:00] <@Menitta> Nah I don't think Woolie likes those games
[4:58:00] <+mechslayer71> like one week
[4:58:02] <+meteor530> Did Woolie ever do a Vergil Bloody Palace?
[4:58:04] <%kyh9> Yo, FF6 soon
[4:58:05] <+viredae> oh nice
[4:58:12] <BlackermanZX> s o o n
[4:58:17] <%arkv01> no but where is it tho
[4:58:22] <%arkv01> give lp NOW
[4:58:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1493839904186503170?t=YO4iMpiXtS4ChklGkEnM1Q&s=19
[4:58:28] <@Solidus_113> there's review codes, but also street date broken
[4:58:30] <@Menitta> Retailers are getting some so be careful  btw
[4:58:35] <SomeAsianDood> @LastHazzerd you basically get "locked out" of the level. That becomes your default run moving forwards to the next levels
[4:58:36] <+mechslayer71> @meteor530 he tried one stream with Reggie, cavaliers Angelo blew him up
[4:58:53] <%arkv01> surprised our boys didn't get review codes :(
[4:59:03] <%LastHazzerd> @SomeAsianDood is this intentional? and/or is it gonna get fixed?
[4:59:20] <T_Sasquatch> We're very aware woolie Kappa
[4:59:27] <+Jiggisnipe> I mean Woolie is about to play FF6 for the 1st time lol
[4:59:34] <@Menitta> I don't like it that the early get exists honestly. it's a fun communal experience when it drops at the same time for everyone
[4:59:37] <+meteor530> @mechslayer71 Oh haha I hope he does another go when he gots a firm grip on the character.
[4:59:47] <SomeAsianDood> @LastHazzerd I think it's unintentional? Because the game prioritizes runs with lower age above all else (hence lock in 20), they might be looking to fix that.
[5:00:09] <+eiightbiitt> !uptime
[5:00:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL don't recommend rabi ribi
[5:00:09] <@Moobot> @eiightbiitt WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 16 minutes

[5:03:06] <@Menitta> First one's fun. Got problems but fun combat. Definitely should play the first though. Even without knowing what 2 does, it establishes a lot.

[5:03:09] <%SirGO0SE> ubisnore
[5:03:13] <+vaderxyz1970> I cant believe Woolie marathoned Horizon for a Horizon 2 LP
[5:03:38] <+DeadManProp> Horizon is great in that it doesn't FEEL like a Ubi formula
[5:03:38] <@Menitta> The combat and enemies are the draw
[5:03:44] <@Menitta> for Horizon
[5:03:45] <kainsonofdeath> sorry if its already been asked? But are you alowed\will you LP Persona 5?
[5:03:47] <+Tuffty> Reminds me, are you gonna play the Ghost of Tsushima DLC at some point?

[5:03:52] <%SirGO0SE> a based view

[5:04:05] <Retinolgaming> Horizon didn't feel as ubi formula to me honestly.
