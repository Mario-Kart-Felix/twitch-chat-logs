[0:55:12] <HitchhikingThrough> i dont trust this goat
[0:55:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @velgaduere and sukon to 😞
[0:55:31] <HitchhikingThrough> @philanthropyg so is lancer tho

[0:55:48] <velgaduere> @SuckerPunchSyd deez are the worst ailments you can get :(
[0:55:54] <+cermo55> @PhilanthropyG he's from the main fountain, which is special, he's also the only one that we know of from their
[0:55:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @HitchhikingThrough but royalty of one of the side dark worlds i think, but ralsei is from the main one
[0:55:59] <PhilanthropyG> @HitchhikingThrough reverse uno card, Ralsei is the original. Lancer and his dad only showed recently.
[0:56:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[0:56:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> You might say shes gonna take Noelles Face.......off
[0:56:09] <peachy996> Probably because Ralsei has a very clear connection to Kris and/or Asriel
[0:56:17] <peachy996> That would be my guest
[0:56:26] <+Akizea> well Ralsei is an anagram for Asriel so
[0:56:34] <HitchhikingThrough> @philanthropyg reverse reverse uno card, we only have ralsei's word that he was first
[0:56:36] <SixthShinx> Scoot that boy to the table, btw
[0:56:40] <+cermo55> push lancer left

[1:02:02] <nanomachiner> @BisoromiBear do you want to know?
[1:02:03] <hassanico2> I don't get the background. Are they wearing suits or corsets?
[1:02:15] <peachy996> yes
[1:02:17] <+Maleicus> suits
[1:02:19] <captain_elsewhere> why not both hassanico2 adumOwo
[1:02:30] <PolitePolicy> Stealing Noelle's items is totally worth it.
[1:02:39] <hassanico2> Yeah especially her watch
[1:02:39] <nanomachiner> rude
[1:02:45] <%BisoromiBear> @nanomachiner probably not
[1:02:47] <peachy996> Picture them as wearing corsets over their suits
[1:02:59] <dukenux> @hassanico2 my guess suit vests
[1:03:00] <hassanico2> why would buff dudes wear corsets though
[1:03:03] <nanomachiner> please do not rob noelle
[1:03:10] <hassanico2> Oh suit vests makes sense
[1:03:12] <PolitePolicy> Always rob noelle.
[1:03:21] <oddbunker> Rob the raindeer
[1:03:23] <hassanico2> Take all of her worldly posesssions
[1:03:32] <+TheFrancix> royal pins are worth it
[1:03:44] <+TheFrancix> mannequin is garbage
[1:03:59] <%teslaclesdeviant_> its useful for the secret boss i guess?
[1:04:08] <underFreddy> uh, I think you'll find the mannequin is the best item in the game?
[1:04:08] <$feiashtear> Mannequin Is good against only one enemy
[1:04:17] <realestjojo> what section is Woolie at
[1:04:20] <laserbeaming> Oh, it's a Big Shot Bowtie. I didn't put 2 and 2 together
[1:04:24] <PolitePolicy> Mannequin just gives you something a lil' extra later on.
[1:04:24] <@Solidus_113> just entered the mansion
[1:04:34] <realestjojo> Ah nice
[1:04:59] <+TheFrancix> is woolie going to do the optional stuff?
[1:05:14] <PolitePolicy> I dunno, is he? These are the mysteries.
[1:05:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheFrancix if he remembers maybe
[1:05:15] <mrpraise_> just arrived, did he get the banana?
[1:05:19] <+thelovingfool> if he remembers to go to garbage area
[1:05:21] <laserbeaming> I'm not sure? Did he do Jevil last time?
[1:05:22] <realestjojo> Oh was this a fresh save?
[1:05:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mrpraise_ potassium
[1:05:25] <hassanico2> but... but the cuteness :(
[1:05:26] <PolitePolicy> I should bloody well hope he got the banana.
[1:05:30] <hassanico2> @realestjojo yes no gear
[1:05:33] <PolitePolicy> He will get sick.
[1:05:40] <realestjojo> Aww
[1:05:41] <@Solidus_113> you can buy amber cards, it's fine
[1:05:48] <captain_elsewhere> just realised, the cafe music remind anyone of a parasite eve tune?
[1:05:53] <+TheFrancix> i hope he remembers to go to the trash zone
[1:06:05] <$feiashtear> nooo
[1:06:05] <+cermo55> fusing item seemes to be a between main adventures thing
[1:06:07] <+ViewtifulJew> NO
[1:06:07] <dukenux> r
[1:06:09] <PolitePolicy> Oh god don't do it.
[1:06:16] <hassanico2> Mannequin has a use?
[1:06:19] <@Solidus_113> also you bought the mannequin for $300
[1:06:25] <%Juriasu> you get so much money in this game, you might as well save it
[1:06:25] <PolitePolicy> Mannequin has a LOT of uses.
[1:06:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> keep it just in case
[1:06:33] <%ne0bunny> you paid 300 to get it woolie
[1:06:47] <+TheFrancix> you get a lot more money by sparing monsters
[1:06:54] <%Juriasu> or hell even buy things you don't think you won't need is a good idea because you might be able to fuse it
[1:06:55] <@Solidus_113> Also you can use the door to teleport back to the garbage heap and meet Spamton like he asked
[1:07:03] <iambqb> The bullet hell mechanic means you can always put in the work to get good whenever you find you're undergeared
[1:07:11] <+thelovingfool> go to garbage area
[1:07:21] <+agumon9000> garbago area
[1:07:25] <hassanico2> I am glad it's legs and not feet

[1:18:59] <DarthJawa5> For a big shot he seems pretty short
[1:19:01] <hassanico2> @RyuuAoi just a key item
[1:19:08] <+Yamchadassist> well he wants to be a bigshot
[1:19:13] <Treasure_Vault> Pat is a big shot, he's short
[1:19:16] <hassanico2> Eh Woolie's paranoia is understandable, but we have a big Storage
[1:19:19] <nanomachiner> Well wait, you do have a storage now
[1:19:20] <hassanico2> So you could just like, dump it in there
[1:19:27] <laserbeaming> The items don't matter though. Only restoration is worth it.
[1:19:37] <PolitePolicy> Oh god, I just realized now Woolie has to find the entrance to the basement.

[1:22:33] <subjectg> Woolie VS Color Theory
[1:22:35] <%teslaclesdeviant_> CHECK THEM I SPENT SO MUCH TIME NOT GETTING THE MECHANIC
[1:22:36] <Treasure_Vault> I'd love to see a Toby Fox Yoko Taro collab
[1:22:40] <glass_marcus> Art degree time
[1:22:40] <Hirumm> will Woolie get this?
[1:22:47] <+Maleicus> i never seen anyone do this competently
[1:22:47] <laserbeaming> I would expect woolie to be better with colors than Pat
[1:22:48] <hassanico2> Eh let him experiment
[1:23:00] <Treasure_Vault> It's weird, I checked EVERY enemy the first time I saw them
[1:23:12] <Inqy833> Birdies!
[1:23:15] <hassanico2> People really ignore Check huh
[1:23:22] <Treasure_Vault> Because it's a joke, and I want to see the check joke and learn how to win
[1:23:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:23:25] <hassanico2> Guess the Bestiary OCD is only common with a few
[1:23:29] <ChocolateVGZ> how's your color theory?
[1:23:30] <Ecall10528> Makes me sad nobody ever once checks.
[1:23:33] <+TheFrancix> spare
[1:23:39] <dukenux> cause they think: check = missed turn
[1:23:39] <subjectg> there’s some fun jokes in Chekc
[1:23:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:23:43] <PolitePolicy> Oh no.
[1:23:44] <thunka10> this'll be fun
[1:23:45] <@Solidus_113> let him learn chat
[1:23:46] <Treasure_Vault> Every check is more texts, why would you not click it
[1:23:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he'll get it
[1:23:58] <subjectg> Like how Berdly’s check tells you to play “bump of chicken”
[1:24:03] <dukenux> even tho some provide helpful information
[1:24:05] <hassanico2> wait
[1:24:08] <+ATentacleMonster> Hope you both love this wacky ass game LUL
[1:24:11] <hassanico2> Do these guys have 5 different attacks?!
[1:24:15] <hassanico2> One for each color? LUL
[1:24:16] <laserbeaming> if you Check, it'll tell you
[1:24:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea depends on their colors
[1:24:24] <%RyuuAoi> Make it hot!
[1:24:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's cool
[1:24:30] <captain_elsewhere> birbs
[1:24:31] <dukenux> did they dab
[1:24:38] <hassanico2> Color doesn't matter as long as it synchs up once
[1:24:42] <lotharrio> ...Ralsei is a strange name, comparatively
[1:24:44] <Inqy833> POTTERY NOT RESPECTED!!!!!
[1:24:50] <@Solidus_113> you could just walk back to the save
[1:24:51] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie figured it out
[1:24:55] <ChocolateVGZ> There will be plenty swatchlings
[1:24:59] <hassanico2> LUL
[1:25:01] <realestjojo> riiiip
[1:25:05] <ChocolateVGZ> leave the room and come back after this
[1:25:13] <+meniscate> [[BIG SHOT]]
[1:25:14] <thunka10> It's really odd that Woolie used goombella at the start of every fight in Paper Mario, but doesn't use a turn to check in Deltarune.  not bad, I just hadn't noticed until now
[1:25:17] <captain_elsewhere> anyone think those pots look exactly like the genie pot from links awakening ?
[1:25:18] <realestjojo> also man forgot how little money you get for sparing
[1:25:37] <ChocolateVGZ> You get more money based on how much TP you have at the end of the battle, though
[1:25:39] <MethodiaLordae> banger alert
[1:25:41] <thunka10> I thought people would be all or nothing on the check strat
[1:25:46] <Treasure_Vault> is this in roygbiv order?
[1:25:49] <Ecall10528> It depends on how much tp you have.@realestjojo
[1:25:50] <ChocolateVGZ> So if you need to save up cash, can hold off on sparing until maxed
[1:25:51] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i mean you could just grind defend for more tp > more money
[1:25:58] <hassanico2> @Treasure_Vault Blue Green Yellow Brown Red
[1:26:02] <hassanico2> Er, the brown is orange
[1:26:05] <realestjojo> Oh huh didn't know that's how it worked
[1:26:06] <hassanico2> But i Read it as brown
[1:26:17] <thunka10> are you color blind?
[1:26:23] <velgaduere> you can spare on the same turn
[1:26:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:26:26] <hassanico2> No it's just a very brown orange?
[1:26:27] <ChocolateVGZ> Did you match then?
[1:26:27] <MethodiaLordae> lmao
[1:26:29] <$feiashtear> Friend?

[1:26:38] <lotharrio> We had "twin day" at my elementary school. That's the closest I ever got to that.
[1:26:42] <+thelovingfool> WHITE
[1:26:48] <thunka10> just curious, I heard orange browns are a colorblind thing
[1:27:01] <ChocolateVGZ> lol, the icon for magic is fire. None of the party members so far have had fire magic
[1:27:07] <@Solidus_113> you could just walk back to the save, it heals you
[1:27:15] <ChocolateVGZ> ^
[1:27:36] <ChocolateVGZ> I do wish heal spells would cast before spares
[1:27:41] <+TheFrancix> go to  the save point
[1:27:43] <%RyuuAoi> Too bad it's not Persona and you can't swap attack order.
[1:27:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> doesn't kris always have a party heal at like 50 tp
[1:27:55] <hassanico2> really?
[1:27:55] <@Solidus_113> that's only for boss fights
[1:27:58] <realestjojo> nope
[1:28:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah
[1:28:00] <GarbageNirvana> Where is the basement anyway

[1:44:15] <+BDazl> Noelle and Susie should kiss
[1:44:18] <hassanico2> I'm pretty sure it is full? Minus one thing that hasn't shown up
[1:44:23] <sporeian94> @nanomachiner  MMW if he does it $50
[1:44:23] <CaliginousAntic> Why do the monsters have LV?
[1:44:28] <+polothegreatest> oooooh woolieMINHMAX
[1:44:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1442731253984370688?s=20
[1:44:30] <%Alcatraz550> Alcatraz550 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:44:33] <$feiashtear> I died 8 times to the thing coming up
[1:44:33] <oddbunker> these monsters have killed before
[1:44:34] <DarthJawa5> @caliginousantic unknown as of yet
[1:44:35] <%0rond> they aren't monsters
[1:44:36] <+Maleicus> they arent monsters
[1:44:38] <hassanico2> Because the entire lecture on LV is dumb nonsense
[1:44:38] <%0rond> they are darkeners
[1:44:39] <laserbeaming> 369. Nice
[1:44:43] <+MKUltima> mkultiNice
[1:44:46] <realestjojo> Also don't forget that this isn't Undertale
[1:44:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> poof
[1:44:51] <linSP> suzie is the only monster here
[1:44:56] <+MTLxSpider> Someone's bite the dust
[1:44:56] <Champstice> Oh, the upcoming puzzle here's gonna be GREAT
[1:44:59] <+BDazl> Dust
[1:44:59] <realestjojo> LV means something completely different here
[1:45:00] <MethodiaLordae> MC is level 2, true pacifist ruined
[1:45:02] <+Maleicus> bugs
[1:45:02] <SomeOtherNeb> get them double Ds, Woolie
[1:45:02] <linSP> oh and the bird
[1:45:02] <+TheFrancix> dark world LV is different from real world LV
[1:45:05] <+Maleicus> probably
[1:45:05] <lotharrio> Dark Dollar for your money hole.
[1:45:06] <+meniscate> money hole Kreygasm
[1:45:09] <oddbunker> hope so
[1:45:16] <hassanico2> No exit
[1:45:18] <+BDazl> Dark DOLLA
[1:45:18] <DarthJawa5> One dollar PogChamp
[1:45:19] <LoneFonte> LV probably doesn't mean the same thing as Undertale, every party member is LV 2 in chapter 2
[1:45:21] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i lhave a weird thing where i can never get rotation right so this was FUN
[1:45:23] <+TheFrancix> first death might happen
[1:45:24] <%0rond> kris does get LV by defeating darkeners doesn't he?
[1:45:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> weeeeeee
[1:45:26] <realestjojo> Also I know Woolie won't see this, but for anyone else, if you stand around with those chain chomp wires
[1:45:29] <realestjojo> And just stare at them
[1:45:32] <victaghost> 0rond no
[1:45:33] <realestjojo> You might see somethin
[1:45:34] <+tussletoes> did something fade off the edge of the screen there?
[1:45:34] <%0rond> huh
[1:45:36] <SixthShinx> @0rond No, they run away
[1:45:41] <+MKUltima> hecticPeek hecticPeek hecticPeek
[1:45:41] <%0rond> I never fought anyone so I just assumed
[1:45:44] <CaliginousAntic> Kris doesn't technically deafeat darkners in most runs they just run sawa.
[1:45:44] <silverpoyozo> here it comes
[1:45:44] <Ecall10528> It is time.
[1:45:49] <@Solidus_113> good luck

[1:46:25] <+TheFrancix> FIRST DEATH
[1:46:25] <LoneFonte> @0rond they get stat boosts but at no point they level up
[1:46:26] <victaghost> the true final boss is the teacups
[1:46:28] <+MTLxSpider> @cyan_dream 🤫
[1:46:30] <%RyuuAoi> Wow

[1:46:31] <Ecall10528> 1
[1:46:36] <laserbeaming> TBF, they're bullet colored
[1:46:36] <+CheyMix> first death
[1:46:36] <+Cyan_Dream> Literally shadow puzzles
[1:46:36] <ChocolateVGZ> They patched it so you don't have to dodge the plugs
[1:46:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not bad, this might be the hardest part tbh
[1:46:39] <mothdude> Thank god this respawn point was patched in
[1:46:45] <ChocolateVGZ> used to start back at the save
[1:46:47] <NinjaGentleman> oh nice for them to update the game and not having to walk from the save point
[1:46:48] <sporeian94> $25 if he does it second attempt
[1:46:52] <hassanico2> @LoneFonte well duh no one's dying :)
[1:46:54] <Darthkitten_Prime> Wait there's a respawn point here now?!?
[1:46:56] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[1:46:57] <MethodiaLordae> @sporeian94 not gonna lie.. kinda cringe
[1:46:59] <Bluezero24> It's ok Woolie, I died to that too

[1:47:07] <ZeeJiggle> Its genuinely tough.
[1:47:07] <@Solidus_113> just watch the shadows

[1:47:08] <%Proxzo> TRUE GAMER
[1:47:08] <Zeif00> LUL
[1:47:09] <+VictorVonLouche> Look at the floor not above
[1:47:09] <%duckmeat_woohoo> This is the Sans fight of Deltarune
[1:47:10] <Nomad94> I died to this so much
[1:47:10] <DarthJawa5> @darthkitten_prime it got patched cause people die here so much
[1:47:10] <nanomachiner> It BEGINS
[1:47:12] <mads_valentine> There are shadows on the screw.
[1:47:15] <peachy996> it's a toughie
[1:47:16] <%Javaa01> Shadow Puzzles
[1:47:16] <+YoSoyConando89> This shit is the hardest part
[1:47:17] <NinjaGentleman> he's surprisingly nailing the spiral down well
[1:47:17] <+TheFrancix> BOI
[1:47:19] <UndeadManatee> forgor
[1:47:20] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i literally died like 15 times on this
[1:47:21] <laserbeaming> looking at the shadows on the floor helps a lot
[1:47:22] <latterbug_> good luck!
[1:47:24] <%Proxzo> Yeah this was a pain
[1:47:28] <+rafeeyell> This was legit the hardest part of the game. I did everything else in one shot
[1:47:30] <laserbeaming> but yes, this one can take you a while
[1:47:30] <%RyuuAoi> There is a pattern. I can see it now. Counter clockwise
[1:47:31] <Darthkitten_Prime> @DarthJawa5 Yeah, I was one of those people.
[1:47:32] <%Proxzo> But pretty amazing when you get it
[1:47:33] <ChocolateVGZ> if you just hold right at the start, the first spiral is easy
[1:47:33] <subjectg> I actually second tried this somehow
[1:47:34] <Ecall10528> Good luck!
[1:47:35] <skinsmckenzie> I actually found it easier to *not* to look at the shadows
[1:47:42] <Qsmash_> I feel lucky having passed it on the first go
[1:47:43] <+Maleicus> @NinjaGentleman the spiral is the easiest part
[1:47:44] <brisk_dacat> Find the Golden Rotaion Speedwagon
[1:47:55] <realestjojo> It got patched, lol?
[1:47:57] <ChocolateVGZ> OOF
[1:47:58] <+polothegreatest> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:47:58] <+YoSoyConando89> Had an easier time dodging the super boss

[1:48:09] <ChocolateVGZ> they patched the continue point, that's all
[1:48:12] <+TheFrancix> progress
[1:48:13] <Carlioo> yeah I died like 6 times to this
[1:48:15] <%RyuuAoi> Yeah that's cheap
[1:48:15] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @subjectg
[1:48:16] <realestjojo> Ah fair

[1:48:38] <+BDazl> Good QoL patches
[1:48:38] <devanmuse> I lucked the fuck out on this part. did it my first try before even learning those damage dots were a thing
[1:48:39] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:48:40] <ChocolateVGZ> Would prefer they start you at the switch. But it's probably so you can still leave if you want
[1:48:41] <reonome> LUL
[1:48:44] <+YoSoyConando89> I think the checkpoint came in a patch

[1:48:56] <Shirousuke1989> Try paying attention to the shadows
[1:48:58] <ChocolateVGZ> lol Ross
[1:49:00] <hassanico2> Yeah you reloaded at the save point
[1:49:00] <+MTLxSpider> Maybe yes maybe not 🙂

[1:49:29] <Niney_Who> I generally advise keeping near 4 o'clock after the two spinning parts just because there's more spaces on that side and you can tank some hits
[1:49:30] <CaliginousAntic> Why are there teacups in computerworld anyway? Is ut because of Java?

[1:51:56] <Kain5707> did Woolie use the phone by the plugs yet?
[1:51:58] <hassanico2> it's just time based
[1:51:58] <realestjojo> Smile looked familiar too doesn't it?
[1:52:03] <hassanico2> The phone does nothing
[1:52:03] <realestjojo> And you don't need the phone
[1:52:07] <+TheFrancix> spamton time
[1:52:13] <+Maleicus> the phone does the noise anytime in darkworld
[1:52:13] <hassanico2> BLUE BALLED
[1:52:15] <Niney_Who> Chat shush
[1:52:16] <PolitePolicy> Someone has a theory that the dog dollar will eventually be worth so few dark dollars that it'll stack overflow and be worth max money.
[1:52:17] <Qsmash_> never read the chat when streaming undertale(deltarune)
[1:52:18] <latterbug_> D:

[1:52:29] <+BDazl> Good time for a break
[1:52:31] <stubborndeer> Dog dollar is tradeable in game for a high armor
[1:52:32] <dds333a> BRB
[1:52:33] <Visorak6> Put people in emote mode when you get back

[1:52:49] <latterbug_> SourPls
[1:52:54] <CaliginousAntic> The only belief I have is that the dog dollar can only be used for a Toby store that has an item that costs 1 dog dollar.
[1:52:56] <realestjojo> Also we don't need to be in emote mode yet
[1:52:58] <Hirumm> SourPls

[1:53:52] <stubborndeer> No dog dollar currency has no instrinsic value a single dog dollar is hte same is twenty dog dollars, it depends on what the dog sales machine wants at the time
[1:53:52] <defaultname3887> wait can the mods put us on jail before woolie gets back?

[1:54:36] <stubborndeer> so if the dog trademan wants steel, and he only has wood, he needs the dog dollar so he will trade a lot of wood for it so that he can get that dog dollar for the steel
[1:54:39] <%livlinn> forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry forgottenJerry
[1:54:47] <Ecall10528> Or the dog dollar decreses so much it underflows into infinite money.

[2:16:26] <ChocolateVGZ> Last I knew, they made it so if you do it, he gets angry and does more damage
[2:16:27] <tattleworm> they patched it so he counters it by doing more damage
[2:16:27] <@Solidus_113> he gets upset and deals double damage if you do it
[2:16:27] <%0rond> they didn't patch it out, but now he gets super mad if you do it and starts dealing way more damage
[2:16:27] <hassanico2> It counts how many times you use the exploit
[2:16:34] <stubborndeer> A FREE VALUE
[2:16:36] <stubborndeer> ??
[2:16:37] <realestjojo> Like triple damage

[2:17:24] <CaliginousAntic> A real [Big Shot] move is to make him harder on purpose and play the fight normally. B)

[2:17:38] <ShadeTheNovice> this is indeed the super boss Kappa
[2:17:38] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> the dialog in the background says "knight/mike (not sure) wont you pick up the phone, pull the strings and make it ring"

[2:18:02] <realestjojo> Sigma-ass face
[2:18:05] <%drefizz> 3 easy payments of 9.99? Deal
[2:18:16] <%LastHazzerd> @sporeian94 i feel Jevil is a harder jump from the rest of his chapter, ch.2's level of difficulty is generally more demanding than ch.1's
[2:18:17] <CaliginousAntic> Jevil is harder because the damage to the party is much higher and in Spamton the party can actually ACT.
[2:18:21] <+TheFrancix> can't heal?
[2:18:25] <SomeOtherNeb> all you need is [Hyperlink Blocked]

[2:18:30] <charrchord> a bulletproof argument
[2:18:31] <realestjojo> God I hate that pattern the most
[2:18:32] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> GG
[2:18:33] <%RealThiele> F
[2:18:33] <stubborndeer> Man megaton neo is out of his mind
[2:18:33] <oddbunker> oof
[2:18:34] <hassanico2> Good practice fight!
[2:18:34] <+Parrish_broadnax> Twas not the big Shot
[2:18:35] <dds333a> Not a bad dodge there SeemsGood
[2:18:37] <Visorak6> go buy some heals
[2:18:38] <codymagpie> Ded :(
[2:18:38] <SixthShinx> Yup, phone hands is tough
[2:18:41] <laserbeaming> the hand phones are hard
[2:18:45] <+cmdrmobium> game over music is good at least
[2:18:49] <stubborndeer> You have to beat him with video games
[2:18:54] <stubborndeer> more options faster
[2:18:55] <Zeif00> Pretty good first try tho
[2:18:58] <%LastHazzerd> damaging Spam reduces the length of the attacks, right?
[2:18:58] <CaliginousAntic> Hand phones are the hardest attack
[2:18:59] <ChocolateVGZ> Certain attacks, if you shoot good it will even add to his Mercy Gauge
[2:19:04] <+Cyan_Dream> Just be a [big shot]
[2:19:07] <SomeOtherNeb> doing enoguh damage with the shots also gives a bit mroe mercy
[2:19:15] <defaultname3887> decent attempt tho
[2:19:15] <ShadeTheNovice> yeah get some items
[2:19:17] <ChocolateVGZ> ... put the disk in
[2:19:20] <+kalyxchews> the leadup to this really psyched me out thinking i should only bring solo heal items
[2:19:24] <codymagpie> it's all about the shots :(
[2:19:25] <shauntungosaurus> not about the shots? what about the [BIG]?
[2:19:27] <skinsmckenzie> get some items
[2:19:27] <lotharrio> I saw Mercy% go up during the shots, yeah.
[2:19:32] <%teslaclesdeviant_> he might need to get more healing items lol
[2:19:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:19:39] <@Solidus_113> it's to give you the option to buy more healing
[2:19:41] <Ecall10528> Buy some more items.
[2:19:45] <%LastHazzerd> healing items are for the weak

[2:20:01] <%duckmeat_woohoo> The quick load/absent dialogu is a really smart choice
[2:20:02] <realestjojo> Nah Woolie will just one-shot it Kappa
[2:20:02] <hassanico2> @lotharrio blowing up the heart increases mercy
[2:20:20] <NDenizen> [[BIG SHOT]]
[2:20:22] <%Proxzo> {BIG SHOT}
[2:20:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> [BIG SHOT]
[2:20:25] <sporeian94> snap all when you can
[2:20:26] <stubborndeer> I think the megaton Neo bossfight is timed so the faster you pick options the better it is
[2:20:29] <reonome> [BIG SHOT]
[2:20:29] <Nomad94> [BIG SHOT]
[2:20:32] <ChocolateVGZ> Big Shot isn't good for getting through the walls cause you hit the + bombs too much
[2:20:34] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> I assume this means all the superbosses will use the undertale modes
[2:20:36] <ChocolateVGZ> but other than that it's amazin
[2:20:39] <CaliginousAntic> Snap all is 7% so you get a +1%
[2:20:41] <hassanico2> Like any shmup, it helps to know where things come from
[2:20:43] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> like blue for platforming, the rotating shield one from undyne etc
[2:20:44] <SomeOtherNeb> SourPls [BIG SHOT] SourPls
[2:20:47] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> but each will get a new technique
[2:20:51] <yoshir_in_the_cape> SNapAll is more efficient
[2:20:54] <ChocolateVGZ> @TheJollyFlyingMan I hope so. Sounds so fun
[2:21:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> look at him go
[2:21:01] <yet_another_brony> yeye ultimate heal you wont regret ot
[2:21:02] <%LastHazzerd> them bombs tho
[2:21:09] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> [BIGGER SHOT] - Avoiding copyright issues version
[2:21:09] <deviljhojho_> BIG SHOT
[2:21:10] <NDenizen> This fight is a "real" NEO fight so not necessarily, might just be Toby doing what he couldn't do in UT the first time
[2:21:14] <%teslaclesdeviant_> that attack is way easier without chrarge shots
[2:21:21] <realestjojo> Did anyone hear the dialogue behind the music btw
[2:21:23] <sporeian94> Woolie snap all
[2:21:31] <hassanico2> Let him figure it out Kappa
[2:21:40] <@Solidus_113> it's only the 2nd try, chill
[2:21:41] <CaliginousAntic> It'd be cool if all superbosses are meant to be spins on fights from UnderTale
[2:21:45] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> @realestjojo the parts that are known are "knight/mike wont you pick up the phone, pull the strings and make it ring"
[2:21:48] <ChocolateVGZ> Normal Route Mettaton had the yellow hart shmup stuff, it was just vertical instead
[2:21:50] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie listen to my demands as a stranger on the internet
[2:21:52] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> its too hard to tell if its knight or mike
[2:21:57] <ChocolateVGZ> omg I spelled heart wrong
[2:21:58] <hassanico2> Yeah, heart exploding gives 3%
[2:21:58] <sullivansbizarreadventure> This fight scares me. I doubt I’d be able to do it
[2:21:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh yea 3% for the hear nice
[2:21:59] <realestjojo> I'm thinking Mike
[2:22:02] <NDenizen> "might"
[2:22:06] <%RyuuAoi> Flawless
[2:22:11] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> yeah mike is probably the villain for part 3
[2:22:12] <charrchord> It pulls the strings and makes them ring
[2:22:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pipis
[2:22:15] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> just like jevil said queen
[2:22:16] <CaliginousAntic> pipis
[2:22:21] <laserbeaming> Beware the pipis
[2:22:22] <%LastHazzerd> wasted super charges
[2:22:24] <+brownhornet420> NICE PIPIS
[2:22:26] <oddbunker> nice shots
[2:22:26] <thisisnozakuboynozaku> this theme is Fire bo8Jamming
[2:22:31] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> but Gaster is the one calling for sure becuase hes the man who speaks in hands
[2:22:31] <%Proxzo> NICE PIPIS
[2:22:35] <+HereticSoul> perfect pipis phase
[2:22:35] <ChocolateVGZ> what if chapter 3 boss is pipis
[2:22:36] <sporeian94> the pipis one fucking is the worst
[2:22:43] <CaliginousAntic> The trick with Pipis is to aim after the bounce
[2:22:48] <ShadeTheNovice> nice pipis -> 🔵
[2:23:00] <%RealThiele> Cornholio approves
[2:23:03] <ChocolateVGZ> got a long way to go baby
[2:23:06] <realestjojo> There is another theory regarding Mike tho but that may be getting a bit ahead of things
[2:23:14] <ChocolateVGZ> keep shootin bigshot
[2:23:21] <%TomAtlus> CRACKLING with freedom
[2:23:24] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> @realestjojo the sans theory? thats a HUGE stretch imo

[2:27:26] <%LastHazzerd> right at the end
[2:27:29] <+Maleicus> man of the pipis
[2:27:30] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> i think the fact that he makes the pipis eggs right after the phone call is more gaster hinting and ties him to the easter eggs too
[2:27:43] <ChocolateVGZ> Egg Route
[2:27:55] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> egg%
[2:28:00] <ChocolateVGZ> grooving to the music makes you play better, this is true
[2:28:09] <stubborndeer> He HAS THE POWER!
[2:28:15] <CaliginousAntic> All Eggs will lead you to Gaster where he'll say "It's really funny being an Egg" and that's all.

[2:43:25] <baltazar758> big kromer
[2:43:25] <PhilanthropyG> always fun to see their reactions to wearing things.
[2:43:27] <deviljhojho_> increased KROMER
[2:43:27] <ChocolateVGZ> get big kromer
[2:43:29] <yoshir_in_the_cape> give it to ralz for better heals
[2:43:29] <SixthShinx> You can examine the shadowcrystal
[2:43:30] <velgaduere> it's better on someone who uses magic
[2:43:31] <SomeOtherNeb> the armor probably also makes you a [BIG SHOT]
[2:43:32] <+TheFrancix> could give it to ralsei
[2:43:34] <+polothegreatest> just like narutos LUL
[2:43:36] <%teslaclesdeviant_> i feel like the boss armors are basically best on ralsei
[2:43:43] <laserbeaming> More Magic on Ralsei is good
[2:43:44] <CaliginousAntic> Ralsei wearing the glasses would be cool in universe
[2:43:46] <%teslaclesdeviant_> he needs the def and magic
[2:43:48] <+Yamchadassist> i dont wanna be that guy but he should say no
[2:43:49] <JurassicRaptor> Did it all for the KROMER
[2:43:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ooh big heals
[2:43:53] <Alzero83> Toby did say it took this long to make chapter 2 cause he was writing the scripts for all the chapters, meaning we may get the next ones sooner than we did this episode
[2:43:54] <cheapdoc> Is Deltarune just rpg guilty gear?
[2:43:59] <Niney_Who> Ralsei heals about 5x his magic
[2:44:02] <%RealThiele> healer need gear
[2:44:02] <realestjojo> Is it still Dealmaker if you don't spare him?
[2:44:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lmao "two pairs of glasses"
[2:44:06] <baltazar758> @teslaclesdeviant_ me too. he's usually the first to go down
[2:44:08] <mothdude> Deltarune is just Persona
[2:44:13] <%robosqueeb> I'm hoping we get the next chapters by the end of next year
[2:44:18] <tigerfang86> yea
[2:44:18] <SomeOtherNeb> yes
[2:44:18] <@Solidus_113> yes

[2:44:27] <MetelStar> VoteYea
[2:44:29] <+TheFrancix> [BIG WOOLIE SHOT]
[2:44:30] <laserbeaming> You're a psaBig SHOT now
[2:44:32] <Ecall10528> Yes
[2:44:32] <+Double_Tap_That> Now you're a [BIG SHOT]
[2:44:33] <charrchord> You are a [BIG SHOT}
[2:44:34] <%Prevot> LUL
[2:44:35] <zhukis> You are a [BIG]
[2:44:36] <deviljhojho_> transcendent SHOT
[2:44:36] <kingra> [BIG SHOT]

[2:44:41] <LoneFonte> o7
[2:44:41] <SomeOtherNeb> Give this to me...this *thing*...your BIG SHOT
[2:44:43] <PortableBoredom> The Mannequin and the Frayed Bowtie reduce Spamton's bullet damage by like 35% each
[2:44:44] <%Proxzo> Snake eaaaaater
[2:44:46] <CaliginousAntic> In order to achieve title of [Biggest Shot] you must beat the teacups first try
[2:44:47] <%Zero_Jacks> [BIG SHOT BABY]
[2:44:49] <lotharrio> There can be only one Spamton... and one BIG SHOT
[2:44:50] <baltazar758> above even The Shot
[2:44:53] <wantedsafe471> [HUGEST SHOT]
[2:44:55] <MetelStar> We dub thee Woolie [BIG SHOT] of Maddentown
[2:44:56] <subjectg> This world only has room for one [BIG SHOT]
[2:45:03] <+edd_r_stough> but what about [[mike]]
[2:45:05] <ZeeJiggle> that was the best time to see
[2:45:14] <%RealThiele> Ultima heal *fucking nothing*
[2:45:23] <realestjojo> How appropriate that Spamton who wanted to be the [BIG SHOT] wanted to access Outer [Heaven]
[2:45:25] <ChocolateVGZ> one depending on how you beat him yes, spamton does the same
[2:45:26] <Niney_Who> Pacifism gives your Armor, violence gives you Weapons
[2:45:31] <tigerfang86> you get jevil's huge scythe if you beat him up
[2:45:32] <deviljhojho_> no tomatoSmile
[2:45:35] <+kewlmyc> genocide gave you a weapon, pacifism gave you armor

[3:07:51] <thunka10> at one point during that team they were both red, then you turned one orange, so thery were synchronized at one point
[3:07:54] <%teslaclesdeviant_> he matched them then immediately unmatched so they were still sparable
[3:07:55] <+agumon9000> They were all red and then you made it orange. But since they were all the same at one point you could spare them
[3:07:56] <iambqb> What happened is you matched them, and then changed the colors, but still met the spare condition
[3:07:59] <ChocolateVGZ> You get an item if you UFO them all

[3:24:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hmmm
[3:24:35] <existingdark> pacifist route? Nah. Genocide? get outta here. Romance route? Hell yes, finally some real shit
[3:24:38] <dan_g_v> as long as you're not like my real life brother, you're good Ralsei
[3:24:38] <+Rafraud> NO NO FINISH YOUR THOUGHT RALSEI
[3:24:43] <wantedsafe471> sus
[3:24:43] <+RyTYoung> I have opinions
[3:24:43] <SomeOtherNeb> oh no you won'tst'!!
[3:24:51] <%jolene_orenji> a ralsei-like is a game where dying is common place and your items get lost with each different run
[3:24:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HERE WE GO
[3:24:54] <ChocolateVGZ> I hope Ralsei isn't Asriel, it's too obvious lol
[3:24:55] <televisedrevolting> ADOPTED
[3:24:55] <skinsmckenzie> Yeah he isn't
[3:24:56] <vedajuno> oh boy here he comes

[3:25:04] <%Prevot> what are you doing step-kris?
[3:25:08] <%sewermonk> Ralseis portrait isnt Black and White
[3:25:10] <Qsmash_> Asriel seems like he would be much older
[3:25:11] <laserbeaming> it's time
[3:25:11] <dan_g_v> don't worry, it's just step-bro, not real brother brother!
[3:25:13] <lyzejag> ITS TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME
[3:25:14] <CaliginousAntic> But it doesn't disprove an association
[3:25:14] <+Rafraud> THE BOY
[3:25:14] <ChocolateVGZ> Also he looks too young; Asriel has to be at least 19 or some shit right?
[3:25:14] <%teslaclesdeviant_> its cool to bone your adopted brother's alternate universe form
[3:25:15] <realestjojo> Fun fact guys! When Kris drinks Ralsei's tea. He doesnt react to it. Almost as if it also tastes like water....

[3:50:34] <tigerfang86> the actions get stronger with kris
[3:50:35] <ItsJustShawn> it's balanced to be effective, probably
[3:50:36] <Ecall10528> They are more powerful
[3:50:37] <restingbones> Usually the act you use with Kris is stronger than the act they would do on thier own though
[3:50:38] <lotharrio> Dual techs, man.
[3:50:39] <PhilanthropyG> Woolie not believing in dual and tripple techs CONFIRMED
[3:50:39] <sporeian94> the tradeoff is it's stronger
[3:50:41] <iambqb> team up actions are almost always better
[3:50:54] <+VictorVonLouche> Why does woolie hate tech actions?
[3:50:54] <%RealThiele> gunstar laser
[3:50:54] <+RyTYoung> it'll be more efficient to act with Ralsei or Susie
[3:50:57] <glass_marcus> mad shade thrown at Chronotrigger
[3:50:58] <emptyantics> The tradeoff is that the move is stronger
[3:50:58] <CaliginousAntic> It's either stronger or the same ammount to save menu time
[3:51:04] <Lieutenant_America> woolie the game wouldn't balance it so there's no reason to do a group action

[4:23:12] <baltazar758> look at him goooo lol
[4:23:24] <@Solidus_113> Duck head gives you about 2 HP per hit, laser gives you a 4th attack, and sword gives you bigger damage

[4:23:52] <Inqy833> Is duck the best one?
[4:23:54] <dukenux> @realestjojo i think it says that after you pick it
[4:23:58] <Inqy833> Duck feels like it should be best
[4:23:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> NGL I would like a new Punch Out on Switch
[4:23:59] <MyNameIsRasus> @Solidus_113 there's GAMEPLAY DIFFERENCES???
[4:24:02] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:24:07] <+Cyan_Dream> Did Woolie ever play Punch out? He should give it a go sometime
[4:24:09] <grovertoast> @MyNameIsRasus yup
[4:24:11] <MyNameIsRasus> THAT'S RAD
[4:24:12] <jorniev> man you're so gonna end up fighting your dad
[4:24:14] <+TheFrancix> USE ITEMS
[4:24:15] <MasterTonberry23> Dodged right into it smh
[4:24:16] <+Rafraud> With the snowgrave route this whole dialogue has much different context lol
[4:24:17] <Megaspel> I think it depends on the head/top
[4:24:20] <baltazar758> ultra instinct
[4:24:23] <PolitePolicy> Duck's special makes you do a LOT less damage, I think.
[4:24:33] <MasterTonberry23> @Rafraud funny since you dont even get this fight in snowgrave
[4:24:35] <PolitePolicy> But it also makes a quacking noise when you hit Queen.
[4:24:47] <grovertoast> susie masher
[4:24:55] <MasterTonberry23> booo button masher
[4:24:55] <%Irridium> susie mashing on wakeup

[4:24:57] <+FxyDEV> dae fighting game
[4:25:07] <dukenux> @PolitePolicy oh for real? i guess that's why it took me multiple times, lol
[4:25:13] <%RealThiele> no punch wollz vs all punch peach
[4:25:14] <+Rafraud> @MasterTonberry23 As in the things queen is saying here has more context if you do snowgrave then do this fight on a diff file

[5:02:12] <+compassarisen> No spamton music at all
[5:02:15] <reonome> OST is on bandcamp at least
[5:02:15] <+Double_Tap_That> Toby should add that to a later chapter.

[5:03:01] <%RyuuAoi> Do it like Persona 2 and make you buy the cds ha
[5:03:09] <ChocolateVGZ> If you missed Jevil and go back and beat him on the file you imported from, you can get the item/crystal from the hole, I heard
[5:03:15] <%livlinn> LUL
[5:03:21] <ChocolateVGZ> You can't get both items it seems, though
[5:03:23] <DianaTheAscian> @grovertoast a ittle car can be next to that door but idk y its not there
[5:03:26] <+TheFrancix> @subjectg it gives you the boss item in case you miss the in the previous chapter
[5:03:28] <+Double_Tap_That> Don't be afraid to dream, but eventually you'll have to wake up as well.

[5:06:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh shit
[5:06:26] <dukenux> The Jevil...
[5:06:32] <MasterTonberry23> Oh they did Spamton NEO?
[5:06:36] <dukenux> huh
[5:06:45] <Kain5707> check the hole
[5:06:47] <dukenux> so if you come back to ch1...
[5:06:47] <realestjojo> Huh didn't know it accounts for that
[5:06:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what
[5:06:53] <bobdoletrasher> it do
[5:06:53] <+CheyMix> yeah so he didnt do it
[5:06:56] <yoshir_in_the_cape> it does
[5:06:57] <MasterTonberry23> OR DOES IT
[5:06:58] <dukenux> so you don't have to replay whole thing?
[5:06:59] <SixthShinx> Go back to the hole on the left side of town
[5:07:00] <charm_quark_> does it wollie, does it not know
[5:07:01] <mothdude> It counts no matter what save file you beat Jevil on
[5:07:03] <+VictorVonLouche> Because its assuming you might have switched platforms
[5:07:11] <5Headedragon> You can go back and get it
[5:07:14] <Anonymasque> I got this and have the same question
[5:07:18] <@Solidus_113> it's because you have the chapter select now
[5:07:20] <Lisonfire> it can't tell if its a different computer
[5:07:20] <mesamus> you can replay chapter 1 later and get jevil's item
[5:07:23] <DianaTheAscian> oh does the shard appear in the hole?
[5:07:27] <+asgard147> monkaS
[5:07:29] <emptyantics> This guy is just Plague lol
[5:07:39] <ZeeJiggle> I mean that's just decent advice in general.
[5:07:43] <DianaTheAscian> old man Plague
[5:07:45] <+asgard147> caught by what? monkaS limesS
[5:07:47] <dukenux> you can copy it
[5:08:02] <grovertoast> u can copy it over too if you find it i think
[5:08:04] <ChocolateVGZ> its okay if you hurry you can get through ch1 in less than an hour
[5:08:12] <Kain5707> SPLORT
[5:08:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so do you get like a chapter select after this?
[5:08:34] <grovertoast> we'll see
[5:08:36] <yagirlmayalazarus> Where did the shadow crystal from beating NEO go?
[5:08:43] <ChocolateVGZ> Seam holds onto it
[5:08:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:08:44] <mesamus> either complete chapter 2 on switch or go play chapter 1 in this computer
[5:08:45] <subjectg> Seam has it
[5:09:02] <yagirlmayalazarus> Oh Seam takes them? Interesting.
[5:09:28] <ChocolateVGZ> Twisted Sword is actually not possible to get yet
[5:09:32] <realestjojo> The fact that he also fuses the Thorn Ring
[5:09:34] <+asgard147> Thornring limesEvil
[5:09:47] <+cermo55> top chef
[5:09:51] <emptyantics> Soaking is the new Thorning
[5:09:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS not the ring
[5:09:59] <+Yamchadassist> might need twisted sword in another playthorugh
[5:10:01] <realestjojo> Makes me wonder if there'll be a "third" path when the full game's out
[5:10:05] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Mama miba!
[5:10:08] <Shwepie> Why is the Thornring a fusion item?
[5:10:16] <Ecall10528> Thornring huh? Now that sounds interesting. Kappa
[5:10:18] <%cyberspacecat> yikesring
[5:10:22] <realestjojo> You can puss out of that route at the last second
[5:10:24] <realestjojo> And keep it
[5:10:37] <ChocolateVGZ> Yeah you can't retrieve it if you stick with it, can you
[5:10:46] <ChocolateVGZ> maybe in a later chapter?

[5:37:41] <laserbeaming> but please talk about it
[5:37:42] <XzileGaming> whats the deal with silent hill anyway....
[5:37:42] <evilzoey> silent protagonist
[5:37:44] <charm_quark_> so Chris has had something to do with the gaster bunker in the past
[5:37:47] <ChocolateVGZ> it is a mystery
[5:37:48] <+insanestephen> YOU don't gotta talk about it.....what does Kris know
[5:37:49] <Dirtboar1> friendship route broken
[5:37:55] <Ecall10528> Thanks susie. <3
[5:38:01] <yagirlmayalazarus> The man who speaks in hands
[5:38:04] <+BDazl> Kris actually isn't a silent protagonist, just the Player can't hear him. The other characters repeat what Kris says all the time.
[5:38:10] <Dirtboar1> monster kid is no longer your friend
[5:38:11] <+asgard147> limesHmm
[5:38:11] <+BDazl> *Can't hear them
[5:38:15] <kingofthepenguins777> @XzileGaming I mean it's pretty noisy, and mostly flat in the first place

[5:38:52] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> that barney dude i think is gonna be a future villain hes creepy af
[5:38:58] <ChocolateVGZ> I like this dude, he gets it
[5:38:59] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> and has animations and lines
[5:39:08] <%LastHazzerd> don't really have fun playin' evil routs
[5:39:16] <+BDazl> DIAPS
[5:39:17] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus they talk about a 2 lightners and a prince of darkness saving stuff, but lancer is the only prince of darkness that has ever done anything to impact the endings, instead of ralsei
[5:39:17] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL

[5:39:27] <Sterfam_> this guy is dril, change my mind
[5:39:32] <%Irridium> WELCOME TO THE TRUE MAN'S WORLD
[5:39:33] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> I actually think barney dude might be Susie's dad and she ran away bc he was abusive
[5:39:33] <heartlesshealer> yakuza is here
[5:39:33] <+asgard147> so?
[5:39:39] <Deko_> welcome to the true man's world
[5:39:44] <@Solidus_113> you're the only human in this town of monsters
[5:39:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> *flashback to yakuza*
[5:39:46] <velgaduere> yes that's correct

[5:40:02] <baltazar758> 👏
[5:40:03] <%teslaclesdeviant_> oh watanagashi?
[5:40:04] <MasterTonberry23> does she have faces where her hands would be?
[5:40:13] <%LastHazzerd> "why" is such a hopeless question
[5:40:18] <ChocolateVGZ> purple guy
[5:40:19] <MyNameIsRasus> So what're the odds that Noelle's mom is the Mayor?
[5:40:20] <realestjojo> how is she even talking
[5:40:23] <+Brunocarvalhoc> apparently that sound coming from the door is the cellphone sound slowed down
[5:40:23] <+insanestephen> my guess is muffett is mayor
[5:40:27] <T_Sasquatch> So does she only give handjobs
[5:40:31] <Lieutenant_America> that Ice E guy is a serial killer I swear
[5:40:35] <velgaduere> @realestjojo with her mouth, of course
[5:40:36] <wantedsafe471> Yeah that is an interesting question. You're the only human in the town. where are all the other humans?
[5:40:41] <MasterTonberry23> @insanestephen no it's noelle's bitch mom
[5:40:45] <%LastHazzerd> QC
[5:40:46] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> ^^ yes I believe barney ice-ee dude is a major villain
[5:40:50] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> he will be important in a later chapter
[5:40:57] <+BDazl> I am very curious about the other humans. We know they _exist_ because the book in the library explicitly mentions them. But we don't see them
[5:41:03] <ChocolateVGZ> It's pretty heavily implied Noelle's mom is mayor, but we don't know for sure, he could easily swerve it
[5:41:04] <MyNameIsRasus> Ice E Hoshikage just wants to live a quiet life
[5:41:07] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> I think ICE-EE actually does eat kids
[5:41:17] <+BDazl> Ice Wolf is super cute
[5:41:30] <mothdude> Ice Wolf: Ice-E's only fan.

[6:19:48] <EASrake> Asgore's gonna get foreclosed on
[6:19:49] <+HikariSentinel> Never seen a man so divorced.
[6:19:49] <velgaduere> UT Asgore has it worse, he's a child murderer
[6:19:49] <Dirtboar1> epic divorce man ALSO disgraced cop
[6:19:50] <laserbeaming> It's sad, but I can't say I pity him.

[6:21:44] <Louie_Salmon> I don't think you see these poses anywhere else, that's neat.
[6:21:44] <EASrake> Kris is an imp
[6:21:48] <+Rafraud> I mean kris might actually be super depressed lol
[6:21:51] <mesamus> onion only appears with ch 1 file
[6:21:51] <Vigogs> I love how Kris looks like a lil psycho
[6:21:52] <+thelovingfool> onion is only if u do it on ch1
[6:21:57] <ChocolateVGZ> Wonder if Kris will get better or something and then we see their eyes
[6:21:57] <%RyuuAoi> Kris been THROUGH
[6:21:57] <existingdark> similar vibe to P3 protag
[6:21:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Kris is a mf
[6:21:59] <+Rafraud> Dealing with parents divorce and big brother isn't around
[6:22:01] <+Rafraud> Sadge kid
[6:22:19] <ChocolateVGZ> I mean yeah, from looking at Kris's browser history they definitely miss their brother
[6:22:21] <cosmov06> Literal self-insert

[6:22:29] <+BDazl> FINALLY THEY GET TO MEET
[6:22:50] <+Rafraud> best part best part
[6:22:51] <%RyTYoung> What gets me is Kris is one letter removed from Frisk and another anagram, Toby why you do this to us woolieFABRICATION
[6:22:52] <ChocolateVGZ> And they refuse to look into Asriel's browser history room. AAAND the news clipping about Asgore being removed from the police, and then suddenly Kris stops reading...
[6:22:56] <evilzoey> my fav part
[6:23:00] <+Pachi3000> "goddammit kris where the fuck are we"
[6:23:03] <VorpalSlash> I love this sprite so much

[6:27:12] <%LastHazzerd> it's Kris
[6:27:14] <skinsmckenzie> "I was just stretching my legs on the windowsill"
[6:27:16] <+Pachi3000> bye
[6:27:18] <velgaduere> @hassanico2 you're gonna need to play the first chapter
[6:27:19] <%rasamune> @hassanico2 That's just Kris
[6:27:20] <thewizardchan> Aint no strings on me
[6:27:20] <tigerfang86> Bye
[6:27:23] <coracor> ded
[6:27:23] <%RyTYoung> I'm out
[6:27:25] <GarbageNirvana> Delightfully devilish, Kris
[6:27:26] <%LastHazzerd> just Kris things
[6:27:27] <realestjojo> @hassanico2 I think it's incredibly painful to maybe go without a soul
[6:27:29] <missingangle> "Ah you know what? He JUST left."
[6:27:29] <wantedsafe471> No strings attached
[6:27:31] <ChocolateVGZ> we dunno really but join the guessing game
[6:27:31] <JurassicRaptor> I-so-metric exercise
[6:27:33] <+Walopoh> Back to happy music! :D
[6:27:33] <Shwepie> @hassanico2 Just ripped his own heart out, clearly having a hard time.
[6:27:33] <hassanico2> But it's not HIS soul
[6:27:34] <+BDazl> rip kris, went out just like Papyrus avoiding 1 on 1 training
[6:27:38] <+Pachi3000> aight imma head out
[6:27:39] <+Rafraud> This scene is so well written man
[6:27:40] <%RyuuAoi> KRIS IS ....possessed?
[6:27:40] <+Rafraud> Lmao
[6:27:45] <realestjojo> hence why they can't do it for a long while
[6:27:47] <baltazar758> he reaaaally loves pies huh
[6:27:53] <dukenux> is that a coke joke
[6:27:56] <%drefizz> @hassanico2 kris has to poop outside
[6:27:59] <baltazar758> *they
[6:28:02] <wembleyttv> It's odd how Susie is more of a child to her than you are
[6:28:04] <+asgard147> monkaS
[6:28:18] <Wingsofdarkness2> LUL
[6:28:18] <wembleyttv> I do understand why though
[6:28:20] <realestjojo> also Kris goes by they don't forget
[6:28:21] <+BDazl> this feels so weird seeing them keep chatting like this
[6:28:23] <ChocolateVGZ> Susie acts like she doesn't spend much time at home.
[6:28:26] <nanomachiner> @hassanico2 maybe his butt hurts
[6:28:29] <+compassarisen> Toriel just has unbounded mom energy
[6:28:29] <ChocolateVGZ> Or maybe she doesn't have a home. :c
[6:28:37] <thewizardchan> It very well might be Kris' own soul and that's what we're controlling.
[6:28:43] <tigerfang86> D:

[6:29:22] <%RyuuAoi> What did you do?! Who did you kill?!
[6:29:25] <%Nested_Dreams> remember to check the sink
[6:29:28] <mothdude> Toriel ate all the sugar
[6:29:30] <wembleyttv> I am calling it someone is going to swear before the end of chapter 7
[6:29:31] <tigerfang86> Well

[6:29:33] <tigerfang86> ok
[6:29:33] <+BDazl> well ok

[6:29:38] <velgaduere> -_-
[6:29:38] <+asgard147> okay limesS

[6:29:42] <datNOISE> dude wash your hands after handling your heart
[6:29:42] <tigerfang86> you arent KRIS
[6:29:44] <dukenux> -_-
[6:29:45] <wantedsafe471> What a stylish way to dry his hands
[6:29:45] <%RealThiele> this is fine
[6:29:46] <SteelSnake93101> -_-
[6:29:47] <%rasamune> It's Fine
[6:29:47] <+Damie904> Touch the sink/mirror
[6:29:47] <ShadeTheNovice> didnt even use soap
[6:29:49] <peachy996> 1st Floor Bathroom windows are a thing
[6:29:53] <realestjojo> like I can't imagine moving without a soul is a good experience of Kris is literally throwing themself to move through a window
[6:29:54] <evilzoey> blue ballin
[6:30:09] <wembleyttv> You have no control or choice
[6:30:14] <peachy996> Sometimes standard 2 story houses have a second bathroom
[6:30:21] <%LastHazzerd> this game series is MADE for theory crafting
[6:30:22] <%0rond> my theory is kris is an artificial human that was given someone else's soul
[6:30:36] <%RyuuAoi> Yo. Kris can't be trusted!
[6:30:37] <EASrake> What's weird is that Kris puts the soul back in
[6:30:40] <%paladinstarbuster> theorycraft woolie
[6:30:42] <+asgard147> limesS
[6:30:42] <dukenux> monkaS
[6:30:47] <+BioHunter> bless ya
[6:30:48] <+Rafraud> Kris and goat are sus

[6:30:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bless you
[6:30:54] <+asgard147> bless you Woolie
[6:30:56] <Shwepie> Camera sticks with the soul, but audio sticks with the body.  Fun times.
[6:30:57] <wembleyttv> Bless you child
[6:30:57] <ChocolateVGZ> Body might not work without the soul
[6:30:57] <evilzoey> bless you
[6:31:04] <%LastHazzerd> he's allergic to pie
[6:31:06] <Sapphire_Breeze> monkaS
[6:31:08] <realestjojo> mine is that with Kris being so interested in magic irl, they accidentally made contact with...someone
[6:31:15] <+BDazl> I think it's kinda like what was implied with Spamton's puppet theme. Kris will eventually die if left without the SOUL too long.
[6:31:17] <realestjojo> that someone being us
[6:31:18] <%RealThiele> mom has seen some shit
[6:31:19] <grovertoast> oof
[6:31:22] <%teslaclesdeviant_> OH

[6:31:28] <+asgard147> oof
[6:31:30] <peachy996> I think Kris without Soul has goals he still needs the soul for.

[6:31:57] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ASGORE IS SO DIVORCED

[6:32:08] <peachy996> Asgore is getting to Huey Emmerich levels of oof
[6:32:09] <Nevflinn> Asgore BibleThump
[6:32:12] <+asgard147> Didn't call parents
[6:32:12] <+BDazl> yeah she totally called parents, yep. totally
[6:32:13] <ChocolateVGZ> She didn't call anyone tho :(
[6:32:15] <realestjojo> definitely called her parents there
[6:32:15] <tigerfang86> Hm
[6:32:15] <mothdude> Susie does NOT call her parents
[6:32:18] <ChocolateVGZ> She's going to get in trouble
[6:32:20] <ChocolateVGZ> maybe
[6:32:22] <%RyTYoung> I know its weird
[6:32:27] <%RealThiele> or Kris wants to be evil and we wont let him
[6:32:30] <pricklypissant> Susie is homeless.
[6:32:32] <%RyTYoung> Maybe...she doesn't have parents?
[6:32:34] <%rasamune> Not like someone has to tell you to sit, right :3
[6:32:37] <+BDazl> Man I can't wait for Susie to see the cover to How To Draw Dragons
[6:32:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh god yeah she doesnt have her own room either
[6:32:41] <%RyTYoung> You don't know where she lives
[6:32:43] <silverpoyozo> @pricklypissant probably =(
[6:32:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> She super doesn’t have parents...
[6:32:52] <+BDazl> Time to pet some Cats
[6:32:52] <evilzoey> neco arc
[6:32:53] <ChocolateVGZ> Given her reaction to having her own room in Ralsei's castle
[6:32:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Maybe
[6:32:56] <ChocolateVGZ> I feel like maybe
[6:32:56] <dukenux> "Come home, watch tv?"
[6:33:02] <Lieutenant_America> @realthiele I don't think evil, given their reaction to Snowgrave and obvious affection for specific characters
[6:33:10] <wantedsafe471> Hell Busters, Doom Guys favorite show
[6:33:11] <%RealThiele> true but this is sus af
[6:33:11] <laserbeaming> given how much of a Freak Ice-E is, I'd like to see that movie
[6:33:15] <Shwepie> Invasion of the Cat Petters sounds like something Plague would make.
[6:33:20] <dukenux> mmm
[6:33:24] <nanomachiner> mmmm
[6:33:26] <+Rafraud> SUSIE AT RISK
[6:33:29] <hassanico2> ...they're literally objects
[6:33:37] <%drefizz> @RealThiele you'll know soon
[6:33:39] <dukenux> Susie, did you forgot Lancer almost DIED?
[6:33:39] <ChocolateVGZ> Does Susie just not get it, or is she being optimistic?
[6:33:39] <hassanico2> That won't work Suize
[6:33:40] <EASrake> Susie doesn't get it
[6:33:41] <grovertoast> yeah lets do it
[6:33:42] <wantedsafe471> DEW IT
[6:33:49] <evilzoey> do the dew
[6:33:51] <+Rafraud> If she does that then we get titans
[6:33:51] <televisedrevolting> Aw man, hell yeah ESCAPISM FROM PROBLEMS
[6:33:52] <+polothegreatest> BibleThump
[6:33:52] <Lieutenant_America> SOUL being the fun police
[6:33:54] <realestjojo> @realthiele I'm under the full impression Kris would never let shit like Snowgrave happen if they were under full control
[6:33:54] <+Rafraud> Probs dont lmao
[6:34:01] <skinsmckenzie> placating the Suze
[6:34:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[6:34:02] <realestjojo> we the baddie there
[6:34:02] <mothdude> I love escapism
[6:34:04] <laserbeaming> I don't think she realizes that
[6:34:10] <+BDazl> She didn't know what happened to Lancer when they came back to the light world, so yeah, she just doesn't know
[6:34:10] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, I don't know, have darkners tried existing in this world?
[6:34:15] <+Walopoh> Tbf Susie is the main force for good here
[6:34:18] <scrumbotime> (she drank some of that)
[6:34:19] <%LastHazzerd> fountains mean we go to their world, she wants them to come to ours
[6:34:19] <evilzoey> hahaha
[6:34:24] <+Rafraud> "Come on Kris they're just TITANS"
[6:34:24] <%RealThiele> i mean we bring lancer back and he becoems a card
[6:34:28] <ChocolateVGZ> I feel like Susie is the protagonist sometimes
[6:34:32] <skinsmckenzie> when's Susie gonna become the main character?
[6:34:32] <%RyuuAoi> Jurassic World vibes
[6:34:36] <peachy996> I don't think Kris with no Soul intentions are for pure good or evil. He has his own motives
[6:34:38] <MyNameIsRasus> FESTIVAL EPISODE LESS GO
[6:34:42] <thewizardchan> In my mind, Kris feels like a puppet, and they're desperately trying to break free.
[6:34:46] <Lieutenant_America> @walopoh Susie is literally the only main character with no dirty laundry in any route
[6:34:46] <skinsmckenzie> SUSIE
[6:34:49] <Shwepie> @LastHazzerd Light Fountains, problem solved. Easy.
[6:34:49] <+BDazl> Festival hype

[6:34:57] <+Rafraud> SUSIE WILL REMEMBER THIS
[6:34:57] <+Slattsquatch> Susie is somehow the most unambiguously good character of the main trio
[6:34:59] <+MagiKestral> I'm excited for Susie to be the final boss of Pipis Route. We need a remix of Vs Susiw
[6:35:01] <+Walopoh> @Lieutenant_America don't jinx it LUL
[6:35:02] <Nevflinn> SUSIE

[6:35:28] <%RyuuAoi> No Kris is a bro. Susie is a bro.
[6:35:29] <+MagiKestral> fun fact: if you say ralsei or noelle, Kris apparently says their name really confused. as if they'd only say their names if WE told them to say it
[6:35:30] <+BDazl> Susiezilla hype
[6:35:33] <evilzoey> sounds like a NIGHT
[6:35:36] <hassanico2> Suzie not a fan of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman? Kappa

[6:38:49] <restingbones> paperWAH
[6:38:50] <+BDazl> But yeah I am very interested, because Kris clearly has their own opinions about what's going on, but the SOUL still forces them to say things??? It's. Interesting.

[6:39:18] <+BDazl> My assumption is that Deltarune is a prequel. And Undertale is just one of many Dark Worlds to "erase" just like we've done to the past two Dark Worlds
[6:39:19] <+cermo55> *kris
[6:39:20] <%RealThiele> Kris wants the titan ending
[6:39:21] <laserbeaming> If the first one was about Susie and Lance. This one is about Noelle and Queen. Next one will be about Toriel and Undyne maybe?
[6:39:24] <realestjojo> i think what Toby us trying to emphasize is Chara isn't behind any of this. it's YOU being the issue
[6:39:24] <koban333tv> SourPls
[6:39:24] <+ConLin_Arts_> Chara is not an interdimensional being, Chara was a regular kid
[6:39:25] <wantedsafe471> If that was flowey, then asriel returning might not who we think they are
[6:39:27] <$JobbedBone> Torial party member? PogChamp
[6:39:28] <thunka10> he DID leave the door open...
[6:39:36] <%duckmeat_woohoo> The door was left open, it can't be just the house
[6:39:38] <+asgard147> She might pop up half-way through the next chapter?
[6:39:38] <SteelSnake93101> He opened the door too
[6:39:39] <+Walopoh> Undyne gonna be a goddamned Superhero in the Dark Realm
[6:39:40] <+Rafraud> Chara was just a shit kid
[6:39:46] <bruuzer12> What if Asgore gets caught up?
[6:39:47] <$JobbedBone> So far it has been board games and the internet, two ways to ESCAPE from real life
[6:39:47] <laserbeaming> Kris DID leave the door open
[6:39:48] <missingangle> Toriel as a party member and she just throws pies
[6:39:50] <peachy996> so we'll see how Toriel reacts to Ralsei
[6:39:52] <+BDazl> [[BIG SHOT]]
[6:39:52] <dukenux> Ralsei will show up again too, cause i feel like he can just sense those fountains opening
[6:39:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SEVEN CHAPTERS
[6:39:53] <+FxyDEV> do we have time for EVIL?
[6:39:54] <wembleyttv> In Charas ending she has that evil smile and in genocide you give Chara your soul and destroy the world and move onto the next
[6:39:55] <Lieutenant_America> they've put too much work characterizing Kris as sympathetic for them to just be evil- especially when it's such an obvious guess
[6:39:55] <MyNameIsRasus> GOOD WORK TOBY
[6:39:56] <+MagiKestral> Chara had a lot more hate in their heart than Kris seems to have. especially when THEY keep closing the fountains they open
[6:39:57] <+Rafraud> THREE MORE YEARS
[6:40:02] <@Solidus_113> and this is where you would normally find out about 7 chapters
[6:40:02] <$JobbedBone> so I'm thinking the next one will be television
[6:40:02] <+BDazl> Playable Toriel will be hype
[6:40:03] <dukenux> like, he just went to the Cyberwrold
[6:40:04] <%SuckerPunchSyd> TV is next for escapism
[6:40:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @FxyDEV def not today
[6:40:06] <Louie_Salmon> Yep

[6:40:14] <ExileNineteen> @MagiKestral well, they don't, the player does right
[6:40:19] <+Rafraud> TIME TO KILL
[6:40:20] <thewizardchan> @BDazl Holy shit maybe that's how Sans and Papyrus "just showed up" in Undertale.
[6:40:23] <EASrake> That was the main menu
[6:40:25] <+polothegreatest> bayo3 levels of patience
[6:40:30] <peachy996> Find out in 4 years on the next episode of Deltarune
[6:40:38] <+BDazl> @thewizardchan Could be!
[6:40:44] <wembleyttv> And the line "When was you in the one in control"
[6:40:47] <tezelbezel> deltrune 7 coming 2045!

[6:40:53] <ChocolateVGZ> Toriel Party Member next time
[6:40:56] <ChocolateVGZ> maybe
[6:40:58] <wantedsafe471> Wait, when did kris have to time to make a dark fountain for the computer room?
[6:41:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not holding my breath but I really hope it doesn't take as long for the next parts to come out
[6:41:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[6:41:18] <ExileNineteen> @wantedsafe471 i think he did it the night before chapter 2, at the end of chapter 1
[6:41:19] <subjectg> last chapter, when they tossed their soul in the birdcage
[6:41:21] <dukenux> @wantedsafe471 in the night between ch1 and 2
[6:41:22] <DetroitSentai> @wantedsafe471 at the end of ch1 when he throws you out
[6:41:24] <realestjojo> There isn't a 3rd one
[6:41:26] <ShadeTheNovice> @wantedsafe471 between chapters Im assuming during the night
[6:41:27] <+BDazl> Weird Route / Snowgrave yeah
[6:41:27] <+Rafraud> There's only 2 runs in this one
[6:41:27] <+FxyDEV> theyre the same run
[6:41:28] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's a whole thing.
[6:41:29] <ChocolateVGZ> It's internally referred to as "Weird"
[6:41:29] <grovertoast> there's no geno run?
[6:41:30] <+thelovingfool> no third
[6:41:31] <baltazar758> weird route
[6:41:32] <@Solidus_113> genocide is "weird"
[6:41:33] <%0rond> weird is the name for this game's genocide run
[6:41:34] <%ThatsMyTrunks> There's only the one more route. Super worth doing.
[6:41:36] <+Rafraud> Weird route is only other one
[6:41:36] <subjectg> pipis route
[6:41:36] <velgaduere> Weird basically is Genocide
[6:41:38] <+Slattsquatch> Geno IS the weird run
[6:41:38] <zk_nails> really only 2
[6:41:39] <+GrandFig> it's only weird route
[6:41:39] <heartlesshealer> The file names just call it "weird"
[6:41:39] <evilzoey> genocide is weird run
[6:41:39] <wantedsafe471> Ah, that does make sense
[6:41:40] <ChocolateVGZ> If you beat the Queen with violence, Berdly's arm gets ruined
[6:41:40] <bobdoletrasher> just normal and weird
[6:41:47] <DetroitSentai> its not genocide but its not not genocide
[6:41:47] <%RyTYoung> There's a "weird route"
[6:41:47] <%RealThiele> chat shutup bout spoilers
[6:41:48] <%blastyoboots> ssssshhhhhhhhh
[6:41:49] <+thelovingfool> Geno is the weird yeah
[6:41:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> weird route is a worse genocide route
[6:41:50] <ShadeTheNovice> there is only normal and weird
[6:41:51] <@Solidus_113> the 3rd is just a variation of pacifist
[6:41:52] <Louie_Salmon> You can do them together, that's probably the way to go
[6:41:55] <%RyuuAoi> Play 3rd Strike woolieVS Punchmom, Woolie!
[6:41:56] <+Walopoh> Hallo y'all
[6:42:00] <laserbeaming> It's weird. you don't kill every character, but you kill characters in a specific way
[6:42:03] <wembleyttv> Deltarune is undertale genocide run
[6:42:06] <+cermo55> The Deltarune alt rount is more specific than just kill everything
[6:42:13] <existingdark> well right on time for me to clock out. Thank you two for the stream today!
[6:42:22] <+BDazl> Weird has much stronger differences. Attacking people without going Weird Route gets a slightly different ending otherwise.
[6:42:24] <%LastHazzerd> things are indeed being said
[6:42:25] <realestjojo> it's not too long to do that route
[6:42:37] <%livlinn> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[6:42:43] <nanomachiner> it HAS been 7 hours, so clear to try it another time
[6:42:43] <Eger007> SNOWGRAVE
[6:42:46] <roboyuji> I can't bring myself to do the geno runs
[6:42:47] <nanomachiner> It won't be TOO long though
[6:42:54] <realestjojo> yeah def not in this stream
[6:42:58] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie, who is "you" in that statment
[6:43:00] <+BDazl> Oh that's a cool theory
[6:43:01] <@Solidus_113> think back to after Spamton Neo, where "Kris" is yelling and has goosebumps
[6:43:01] <realestjojo> would have to be another
[6:43:01] <nanomachiner> maybe a good 2 or 3 hrs
[6:43:01] <%RyTYoung> I think theres, pacifist, violent and then snowgrave
[6:43:03] <wantedsafe471> No, the heart is us. i think
[6:43:05] <mothdude> It's like Spamton. Can't live without your strings.
[6:43:06] <baltazar758> lol 🔪
[6:43:08] <%RyuuAoi> P5: Take Your Heart
[6:43:11] <realestjojo> awww
[6:43:15] <+AmanDotZip> @wantedsafe471 yeha i think its the player pov
[6:43:19] <+Rafraud> Kris is just mad about the divorce so they kick you out of control to lash out
[6:43:21] <wembleyttv> Sans does say mid fight talk about different worlds and timelines
[6:43:25] <+BDazl> It's been a really fun stream!
[6:43:29] <Eger007> you should chech it out later, its shorter
[6:43:32] <%LastHazzerd> playing on your own is much better for retention of information
[6:43:36] <bobdoletrasher> @WoolieVersus it's weird enough that some litty reacts would be neat
[6:43:37] <@Solidus_113> Queen is perfect
[6:43:40] <realestjojo> queen the GOAT
[6:43:42] <laserbeaming> I love Queen
[6:43:44] <+Walopoh> LYING
[6:43:47] <ChocolateVGZ> hoo
[6:43:51] <%RealThiele> L M A O
[6:43:53] <Kain5707> SPLORT
[6:44:05] <dukenux> i hope Ralsei gets a bit more development next part
[6:44:05] <ChocolateVGZ> sweet kid, hope nothing bad happens to her
[6:44:09] <ExileNineteen> LOL
[6:44:09] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[6:44:12] <Shwepie> Loved Berdly finding out Queen only plays mobile games.
[6:44:12] <%RyuuAoi> Big stream today! BIG thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Madden!!
[6:44:14] <+Rafraud> Kappa
[6:44:22] <grovertoast> quiet y'all
[6:44:22] <wantedsafe471> Can't wait to see woolie play the Geno/Weird run
[6:44:28] <ChocolateVGZ> Toby knows people love their ships lol
[6:44:32] <heartlesshealer> the sadie hawkman's dance would be cool
[6:44:38] <@Solidus_113> Asgore the most divorced man in history
[6:44:48] <realestjojo> @wantedsafe471 unfortunately he just said he's gonna do it off-stream
[6:44:56] <wantedsafe471> Big Bummer
[6:44:59] <%RealThiele> multi-dimensional divorcing
[6:45:10] <dukenux> She turned the weens against him!
[6:45:11] <wembleyttv> Think is what about Gaster
[6:45:18] <wembleyttv> *thing
[6:45:23] <+Rafraud> HIRE MORE PPL TOBY
[6:45:25] <+Rafraud> WE BELIEVE
[6:45:28] <+BDazl> Geeeeeeet dunked on
[6:45:29] <+Rafraud> FUCK FALCO
[6:45:29] <@Solidus_113> he did
[6:45:31] <realestjojo> he did!
[6:45:35] <%RealThiele> IQ Diaper
[6:45:38] <wembleyttv> Could Gaster be a good person?
[6:45:39] <@Solidus_113> 3-5
[6:45:44] <realestjojo> that's how chapter 2 even happened in the first place
[6:45:46] <@Solidus_113> full product you pay for
[6:45:48] <%LastHazzerd> many of the designs weren't toby's a few songs weren't toby's. for Ch.2
[6:45:52] <grovertoast> 3-5 I think is the next one
[6:45:53] <Drusain> The next release would be 3-5
[6:46:10] <@Solidus_113> 6 and 7 are likely DLC
[6:46:11] <wembleyttv> I think Toby has it all planned out
[6:46:12] <evilzoey> toby's expanding his team to release 3-5 at once
[6:46:13] <realestjojo> Oh thought next was all the rest
[6:46:16] <+BDazl> 70 hour RPG where if you make even one mistake the entire run is on the wrong route and chat will never let you live it down
[6:46:26] <Azmodem> Dont forget Wollie , you choices dont matter, untill they do
[6:46:27] <%xeromage> she adds a lot to it
