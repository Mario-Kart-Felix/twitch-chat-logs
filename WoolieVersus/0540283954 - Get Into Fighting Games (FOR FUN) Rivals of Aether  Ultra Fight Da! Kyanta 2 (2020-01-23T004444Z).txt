[0:10:33] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh damn there are a lot of tutorials
[0:10:37] <+vixenpunch> I’m a big fan of the “keep working on our one game” genre that shovel knight, no mans sky, and this fall into
[0:10:37] <+Gamefriendly> anyone else think the volume mixing is off, the game seems louder. or is it just me?
[0:10:45] <PinkieTheEerie> nah thats right
[0:11:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's fine cause these two can get loud and are perfect
[0:11:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> especially when reggie get's blown up cause he's reggie
[0:11:14] <+Gamefriendly> thats true
[0:11:16] <KSDM> PLAY CUSTOM CHARACTERS Kreygasm
[0:11:22] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Short press for hops for universal overhe- no wait
[0:11:32] <thunderrex> yea they are real quiet
[0:11:36] <+Dimfish> theres so many ridiculous custom characters in this game
[0:11:51] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Like Minecraft Steve
[0:11:54] <+vixenpunch> Short hopping is op in vania-likes
[0:12:13] <+Dimfish> sans hitler and minecraft steve
[0:12:14] <+vixenpunch> It’s basically like higher a tier of gameplay
[0:12:24] <Djinnazz> Damn right
[0:12:24] <@akuda_bar> text noise so satisfying, like prprprprp
[0:12:38] <+vixenpunch> Like a higher*
[0:12:39] <%gatorafan> prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr manesi1Velfeelsgood
[0:12:40] <BackwardCap> Before you learn to attack, you learn to defend.

[0:12:58] <+UnprecedentedStudios> AYO WOOLE PLAYING RIVALS
[0:13:04] <+UnprecedentedStudios> PogChamp
[0:13:07] <%ATRodger> get smashed
[0:13:11] <SchlongKongEduardo> nice
[0:13:13] <+vixenpunch> FRAME COUNTS IN TUTORIALS?
[0:13:16] <+vixenpunch> BLESSED
[0:13:24] <%gatorafan> I believe I've heard Custom Characters are disabled on Online so I'm not sure how worth it'd be for them to check them out.
[0:13:40] <%gatorafan> Especially considering there is another game tonight.
[0:13:50] <KSDM> they can play together.
[0:13:52] <NebulaPurple> ye but you can turn them on in Lobbies
[0:13:58] <+UnprecedentedStudios> ^
[0:14:01] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Another game? What is it?
[0:14:03] <NebulaPurple> cause both players need the same files
[0:14:10] <%gatorafan> Oh, they will probably run lobbies.
[0:14:12] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Although both characters will have to have the same characters
[0:14:21] <xiccy> you can use custom characters online as long as you both have the characters
[0:14:26] <+UnprecedentedStudios> both players*
[0:14:30] <+vixenpunch> Frame data tutorials is the way
[0:14:32] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Also, how do these custom characters work? Are they like mods?
[0:14:38] <DiamondStormOwO> yup
[0:14:39] <NebulaPurple> steam workshop support
[0:14:42] <DiamondStormOwO> workshop characters
[0:14:46] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Yeah the tutorial can be kinda unforgiving
[0:14:48] <NebulaPurple> literally click the subscribe button and they're added
[0:14:51] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh damn thats interesting
[0:14:59] <+vixenpunch> Those who are most confused are the loudest
[0:15:02] <+vixenpunch> Like pat
[0:15:03] <DiamondStormOwO> you have to turn on the open beta for the workshop tho
[0:15:08] <%gatorafan> Workshop is super convenient when implemented right.
[0:15:14] <@akuda_bar> woolieWUT_SG
[0:15:19] <KSDM> ksdmSmug
[0:15:23] <@akuda_bar> that looks... decent
[0:15:30] <+vixenpunch> Oh hey akuda
[0:15:33] <+vixenpunch> It’s duck
[0:15:37] <+vixenpunch> The smartest one
[0:15:43] <@akuda_bar> hi ducko
[0:15:49] <%gatorafan> Also, yeah, these sprites look cool.
[0:15:54] <KSDM> Absa's Theme Kreygasm
[0:15:56] <%Wool> Switching to the workshop beta doesn't take too long
[0:16:03] <%ATRodger> woolieFUN
[0:16:10] <ClairenMain> do a wavedash back jab please
[0:16:18] <NebulaPurple> ye but it'l still a beta so it's kinda buggy
[0:16:36] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Now do a 56 hit combo ending with Vergil's level 3
[0:16:40] <+Taglog7> Big wombo
[0:16:53] <ClairenMain> disable auto run please
[0:16:57] <+vixenpunch> “Alright y’all wanna learn how to do a fuckin infinite”
[0:16:57] <NebulaPurple> ftilt is the hardest attack in this game
[0:16:57] <ClairenMain> :^)
[0:17:07] <Thunderhog> dont get tilted
[0:17:08] <KSDM> evo19MindBlown
[0:17:08] <+BoxNavy> ludwigU smash?

[0:17:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @vixenpunch
[0:17:53] <@akuda_bar> very melee vibes on this tutorial map
[0:18:12] <ClairenMain> buy clairen
[0:18:13] <+Dimfish> @taglog7 there is wavedashing in this
[0:18:15] <KSDM> You can assign tilts to a button
[0:18:18] <+BoxNavy> can you map tilts to the stick in this game?
[0:18:22] <+BoxNavy> oh
[0:18:23] <+Taglog7> Nice
[0:18:24] <+straeger> Just takes a lot of practice to get tilts down
[0:18:29] <Axmos> you can map tilts to stick yeah
[0:18:33] <KSDM> and or a stick
[0:18:35] <Thunderhog> And this is why they made the C stick
[0:18:36] <rcgama> im with you there
[0:18:40] <+BoxNavy> tilt stick ludwigU
[0:18:40] <DiamondStormOwO> yes, you can map tilts to the CStick
[0:18:40] <Axmos> also you can buffer it during anything
[0:18:41] <Thunderhog> Well not really but you know
[0:18:44] <NebulaPurple> tilts to right stick is optimal
[0:18:45] <+Taglog7> All i hear is boomer boomer boomer
[0:18:45] <+vixenpunch> Woolie is speaking my language on tilts
[0:18:50] <SomersaultJustice> woolie, try to remember the basics of cqc
[0:18:57] <Djinnazz> Melaa had it yah
[0:19:05] <Djinnazz> Melee*
[0:19:06] <@akuda_bar> yeah I don't love tilts
[0:19:12] <+vixenpunch> That’s my exact problem with action game melee combos
[0:19:14] <Axmos> meelee did not have tilt stick what
[0:19:14] <$megamonmon123> woolie treat it like a girl, soft and gentle
[0:19:14] <@akuda_bar> especially up tilt
[0:19:21] <+BoxNavy> smash attacks triPog
[0:19:27] <+vixenpunch> Where it requires a pause where you can get hit
[0:19:33] <NebulaPurple> upt tilt is fine if you turn off tap jump, which this game ahs turned off by default iirc
[0:19:52] <DiamondStormOwO> or just use a tilt stick, it's much better
[0:19:54] <+Taglog7> PogChamp Dakus
[0:19:54] <@akuda_bar> I'd have to rewire my brain to tap jump
[0:19:57] <+BoxNavy> thats a brawl thing
[0:19:59] <%Wool> DACUS
[0:20:01] <+BoxNavy> dacus
[0:20:05] <%Wool> Dash Attack Cancel Up Smash
[0:20:06] <Axmos> yes

[0:20:12] <rcgama> shut up
[0:20:24] <+Polter_ge1st> How much did I miss?
[0:20:25] <NebulaPurple> no :v

[0:20:35] <@akuda_bar> I love this fire lion man
[0:20:47] <+BoxNavy> hows your short hops woolie

[0:21:11] <KSDM> mewtwo's and Lucas
[0:21:17] <+vixenpunch> Where short hops reset your quick attacks
[0:21:18] <+BoxNavy> down smashes are ok
[0:21:30] <+BoxNavy> theres better options for most characters tho
[0:21:32] <+vixenpunch> Exceptions are made
[0:21:38] <+vixenpunch> On down smash’s
[0:21:52] <+BoxNavy> no one says uair

[0:28:01] <LoneFonte> they're working on a "definitive edition" before launching on switch
[0:28:30] <NebulaPurple> maffs
[0:28:37] <+UnprecedentedStudios> MAFF
[0:28:39] <TigerClaws12> quick maffs
[0:28:42] <rcgama> quick mahts!
[0:28:42] <Nevereatcars> welcome to intermediate defense bitches grab your protractors
[0:28:48] <TheBrunoZone> It's kinda wholesome that they're working on a version for the switch of all the consoles
[0:28:50] <+UnprecedentedStudios> LUL
[0:28:54] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Thanks cars
[0:28:58] <+Taglog7> But that's good
[0:29:06] <CirclesForever> hey this is furry smash bros
[0:29:14] <NebulaPurple> DI out is for escaping combos, Di in for surviving
[0:29:16] <ZakosDryiakk> Grab the oldest notebook you can and use it to make a rivals setup
[0:29:35] <Zuzu_Pachulia> no smash 4 vectoring
[0:29:38] <ZakosDryiakk> Its high likely it’ll work well enough
[0:29:43] <+Gamefriendly> this is melee di tho right? smash ult is different?
[0:29:43] <PFlare> Yeah, so no Smash style DI.
[0:29:45] <+BoxNavy> that was 4 for a bit i think?
[0:29:45] <DiamondStormOwO> workshop has Sans, just a reminder
[0:29:52] <Nevereatcars> this is melee di
[0:30:22] <@akuda_bar> sans undertale?!
[0:30:22] <NebulaPurple> kinda like KI, you're still playing the game while you're getting hit
[0:30:23] <Nevereatcars> but you can aerial drift left and right during hitstun, AFTER you've inputted DI'd during hitPAUSE
[0:30:24] <jubejube56> geez I forgot how fun kragg is
[0:30:36] <Nevereatcars> which is better than melee di
[0:30:56] <Nevereatcars> where you can't drift until you get full control of your character back
[0:31:16] <mrblack499> what is this?
[0:31:26] <Solidnick18> seems solid
[0:31:36] <NebulaPurple> literally the best platform fighter, gameplay wise
[0:31:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:31:41] <+miyoles> does this game have online 4 player multiplayer yet?
[0:31:47] <DiamondStormOwO> kinda
[0:31:50] <NebulaPurple> it's in the works
[0:31:50] <+UnprecedentedStudios> I love how it showed Kragg F Smash even though it's far from a kill move now LUL
[0:31:55] <DiamondStormOwO> the new netcode is on beta yet
[0:32:06] <Thunderhog> yeah it's machup knowledge
[0:32:21] <Thunderhog> But usualy something sending you Upwards is pretty telegraphed
[0:32:29] <Mothman742> isnt one of the dlc characters ori?
[0:32:31] <+miyoles> poopy
[0:32:37] <+BoxNavy> triPog
[0:32:38] <LoneFonte> @Mothman742 ye
[0:32:39] <DiamondStormOwO> yes
[0:32:46] <Mothman742> litty titty
[0:32:49] <+jiggy_snipe> lol Reggie
[0:32:57] <+BigBruthaThunda> streetwise Reggie
[0:33:04] <rcgama> Reggie knows the secret moves
[0:33:07] <+BoxNavy> 5Head
[0:33:07] <NebulaPurple> yo Ori's in the game, really want to play it now
[0:33:10] <+Gamefriendly> how is smash ults di different? that one works where you want to di opposite from your angle right?
[0:33:14] <+ghostfaceninja_> Reggie found tech
[0:33:18] <%Irridium> I mean, they can't win if they can't knock you out
[0:33:28] <+UnprecedentedStudios> tsbBigbrain
[0:33:30] <+Fenrein> yeah
[0:33:32] <masterfire23> galaxy brain reggie
[0:33:44] <TheBrunoZone> Oh, yeah, in case some of you might not know: Characters like Ori and Shovel Knight are playable
[0:33:47] <NebulaPurple> if you get hit with no way to survive, a purple effect appears
[0:34:01] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Generally
[0:34:03] <PFlare> Smash Ult you can DI in a lot more directions and you can do something like hold forward or something, right?
[0:34:09] <Man_in_the_Red> anyone else see that Blazblue X Guilty Gear is real Kappa
[0:34:49] <Thunderhog> I mean when you're in low damage people are gonna try to land combos to rack damage
[0:34:54] <Nevereatcars> get air juggled tho!
[0:35:06] <Thunderhog> once you're high enough THEN you're gonna start getting those kill moves
[0:35:11] <Mothman742> !uptime
[0:35:12] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 46 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:35:15] <Thunderhog> or combos into kill moves
[0:35:29] <DiamondStormOwO> Ori be like
[0:35:32] <Thunderhog> So you wanna just drop out the light hits so the heavy shit dont land
[0:35:38] <PFlare> WE TECH THOSE.
[0:36:09] <+ghostfaceninja_> moms spagetti
[0:36:10] <Zuzu_Pachulia> TECH DE JESUS
[0:36:16] <+BoxNavy> man smash will never have this shit
[0:36:28] <Kristoffers> 20 second
[0:36:40] <DiamondStormOwO> 1/3 of a secong actually
[0:36:41] <Milo_Oda> god i cant believe i somehow intuited this shit as a child with 64 and melee. my adult mind is like shit this is fucking complicated NotLikeThis
[0:36:45] <+UnprecedentedStudios> 20 frames not 20 seconds
[0:36:55] <Axmos> in this game you dont actually reset it in this game
[0:36:58] <+BoxNavy> this would be a dogshit game if you were out for 20 seconds
[0:37:10] <Axmos> if you mash its 20 frames on 20 frames locked
[0:37:20] <Milo_Oda> hyrule temple? you mean weenie hut jr. Kappa
[0:37:50] <Thunderhog> Thisis ALSO a thing in smash. and the reason why Snakes stage in smash was really dumb
[0:37:53] <Thunderhog> cause you just never die
[0:38:02] <DSD24> I like listening to this music
[0:38:09] <@akuda_bar> I can't tech you guys
[0:38:14] <+pkmamsters> wall teching is how you survive hyrule fight club
[0:38:16] <@akuda_bar> I'm a scrub woolieWUT_SG
[0:38:23] <PFlare> @pkmamsters aMEN.
[0:38:23] <NebulaPurple> you get used to it
[0:38:27] <KSDM> AMSA Kreygasm
[0:38:28] <+BoxNavy> boomer reggie
[0:38:29] <Milo_Oda> does this game have amsa teching
[0:38:31] <NebulaPurple> 20 frames is pretty generous if you don't mash
[0:38:38] <+Gamefriendly> i feel like woolie is leaqrning more about melee then when he did that thing with Kage
[0:38:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:47] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Rivals of Aether has a nice OST

[0:39:43] <korsablade> @Ghostfaceninja53534 Zelda's
[0:39:44] <ManlyMcBeefington> hammer hits have sweet spots I think in melee
[0:39:50] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Zelda fair and bair have sweetspots
[0:40:18] <+BoxNavy> smash has spheres
[0:40:18] <+ghostfaceninja_> puff sleep is the classic tho
[0:40:20] <Goldenwolf98> If you ever want to learn sweet spots use Marth LUL
[0:40:25] <Prevot> hitballs
[0:40:30] <@Solidus_113> Marth tippers
[0:40:34] <Kristoffers> sweet dot
[0:40:38] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Yeah there's hit spheres, boxes, and another shape of hitboxes in this game @WoolieVersus
[0:40:38] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus In laymans terms, most meatys tend to give you sours
[0:40:39] <Mothman742> @thatjuantoo idk man i got it for free but i didnt get the dlc characters

[0:41:40] <+ghostfaceninja_> just promove it
[0:41:41] <thatjuantoo> @Mothman742 Is joke, the DLC characters must be bought when purchasing fighting game.
[0:41:46] <TheBrunoZone> No, shut up. DO COMBO
[0:41:47] <FuqBoiSlim> do...combo....
[0:42:13] <Milo_Oda> hit this pikachu is you can Kapppa
[0:42:17] <+doubletrouble_sg> Hello everyone.
[0:42:18] <animailistic> YEAHHH BOI ITS RIVALS TYME
[0:42:31] <Mothman742> @thatjuantoo ah ok, figured but had to be sure LUL
[0:42:39] <animailistic> Reggie about to turn against smash as it was foretold
[0:42:45] <+BoxNavy> up tilt woolz
[0:42:48] <DSD24> Does the Lion guy have that wolf forward smash?
[0:42:54] <KSDM> yes
[0:42:54] <Thunderhog> And woolie's mind is slowly getting blown
[0:42:54] <+Gamefriendly> woolies face LUL he doesnt want this
[0:42:57] <thatjuantoo> @Mothman742 It's the law :p
[0:43:01] <Kalcom> what is woolie doing
[0:43:04] <animailistic> @DSD24 no but it loks similar
[0:43:20] <DSD24> @animailistic Ok cause it does look familiar
[0:43:26] <Goldenwolf98> He hates it LUL
[0:43:28] <ChrisAlgoo> gonna be a furry but only with this lion in particular
[0:43:40] <Mothman742> another thing thats cool about this game is the custom colors option
[0:43:56] <DSD24> tutorials need good music
[0:44:07] <Zrehael> Oh god, he's really gonna hate this tutorial. XD
[0:44:08] <TheBrunoZone> Every single game should have a custom color creator
[0:44:11] <DSD24> This game has good music
[0:44:12] <animailistic> It's a power palm but wolf's is smaller and one hit, Zett has a vortex first hit at the start of the attack
[0:44:21] <Solidnick18> that's my ledge
[0:44:25] <ChrisAlgoo> The CVS2 custom color creator was really fun
[0:44:25] <+BoxNavy> @WoolieVersus if you do a quarter circle like this ^ 7 > you are forced to walk
[0:44:29] <DSD24> They are dead first Woolie
[0:44:29] <Goldenwolf98> NAH BE COOL THO

[0:44:40] <+jiggy_snipe> naw Woolie you gotta style on dem foos
[0:44:45] <PFlare> It's HARD to get used to, but you have to have faith in your ability to recover.
[0:44:51] <Djinnazz> Naw, he don't get a fall death, you because of ME.
[0:45:01] <%Irridium> what if i wanna play little mac
[0:45:05] <ChrisAlgoo> THIS TUTORIAL OWNS
[0:45:07] <Djinnazz> WTF, that's just FALCO!
[0:45:10] <Goldenwolf98> @WoolieVersus Think of it like killing with taunts in 3rd Strike LUL
[0:45:14] <animailistic> Woolz just has rookie nerves, as he practices recoveries he will get better at learning edgeguards
[0:45:27] <+Gamefriendly> LUL this is great
[0:45:30] <+arcturusblade> this is lowkey the hardest part of the tutorial
[0:45:33] <+jiggy_snipe> lol Woolie

[0:47:02] <Goldenwolf98> Can we all agree Rivals has a great tutorial
[0:47:10] <Mothman742> orcane tutorials NotLikeThis
[0:47:23] <+BoxNavy> that jab is massive
[0:47:30] <NebulaPurple> Rivals teaches you the gist of most platform fighters, it's great
[0:47:34] <animailistic> Yeah Rivals has auuhhhhhhh great everything
[0:47:37] <Axmos> lol "jab is massive"
[0:47:56] <DSD24> Don't be tilted at these tilts
[0:48:12] <%gatorafan> music is pretty cool SourPls
[0:48:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> not gonna lie, this is my first time seeing this game and its way deeper than i thought it'd be
[0:48:23] <+doubletrouble_sg> I enjoy this game more than Smash Ultimate.
[0:48:29] <+BoxNavy> man i wish ultimate didnt get rid of jab cancels
[0:48:32] <Axmos> do the character specific ones
[0:48:37] <%Wool> jab jab powerdunk
[0:48:44] <animailistic> This game is basically the better smash, since 2012
[0:48:47] <@Solidus_113> wave dash?
[0:48:52] <DiamondStormOwO> wave dash
[0:48:58] <animailistic> @Solidus_113 yes dude
[0:49:05] <Milo_Oda> lemme see them multi shines
[0:49:19] <+pkmamsters> dash dance
[0:49:26] <animailistic> Multishines are not a thing unless you install 100% accurate Fox
[0:49:34] <%jumbomanlive> Yooo
[0:49:39] <%jumbomanlive> Hellom Reggie and Woolz
[0:49:53] <@akuda_bar> I spaced out and now we're installing foxes and doing initial d
[0:49:56] <%jumbomanlive> Finally a game I can play lol
[0:49:59] <%jumbomanlive> hello chat
[0:50:10] <Zayasu> HahaCat
[0:50:11] <animailistic> Zetter's shine is more of a linking tool for setting fire to opponents
[0:50:18] <%12StarvingOrphans> 12StarvingOrphans subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:50:19] <animailistic> so you can end in smash attacks
[0:50:26] <Milo_Oda> doesnt zeter have some melee esqu shine stuff
[0:50:29] <DiamondStormOwO> basically, yeah
[0:50:32] <%Wool> bruh just mash it
[0:50:35] <DiamondStormOwO> but Zetter's shine can meteor too
[0:50:40] <%gatorafan> daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:50:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> RAAIIIIIIIID
[0:50:49] <animailistic> @Milo_Oda yes, but its pretty risky and not as abusive
[0:50:50] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[0:50:50] <shadepman> bruh
[0:50:51] <+jonblu10> SPEED
[0:51:00] <lem______> this is dashblocking all over again
[0:51:11] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:51:13] <%Wool> at least he doesn't need to do this 3 times in a row
[0:51:14] <%jinking79> woolieFUN
[0:51:16] <NebulaPurple> zetter shine is radial
[0:51:20] <animailistic> Its almost always safer to use air attacks
[0:51:22] <NebulaPurple> it hits you away from the center
[0:51:27] <+jiggy_snipe> now Reggie continue
[0:51:28] <animailistic> ^^^^
[0:51:28] <KnivesEve> hey yall
[0:51:41] <+Dr_DangerPhD> dash dancing is basically a running shimmy right?
[0:51:47] <animailistic> Yes?
[0:51:49] <eiightbiitt> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:51:51] <+pkmamsters> don't try to dash dance literally 1 pixel from it
[0:51:53] <+ArAechFGC> oh no, woolie is gonna smell now
[0:52:06] <animailistic> since there are no grabs its not the same but fundimentally yes
[0:52:07] <Goldenwolf98> WE MELEE NOW BOIS Kappa
[0:52:17] <NebulaPurple> wavedashing in this game is so good
[0:52:21] <@akuda_bar> the smell of a melee player
[0:52:31] <MetalDeerS0LID> StinkyCheese
[0:52:31] <NebulaPurple> you canliterally just press jump plus dodge with the stick in neutral, and it just works
[0:52:34] <NebulaPurple> IT JUST WORKS
[0:52:38] <DiamondStormOwO> > you can wavedash on keyboard
[0:52:38] <shadepman> monkaS
[0:52:42] <+FadingFrost> this game is amazing. once they added steam workshop it got even better so now its basically mugen
[0:52:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:52:49] <+pkmamsters> i believe Rivals also just has a dedicated short hop button. so wave dashing is as easy as possible
[0:52:51] <animailistic> Wavelands separate low and med levels of play
[0:53:02] <NebulaPurple> you can set a dedicated shorthop and fullhop button
[0:53:15] <Saltmeisterr> sup gamers

[0:53:22] <+miyoles> thats a fun workout
[0:53:33] <DiamondStormOwO> no Peach float sadly
[0:53:49] <animailistic> Med and High levels of play are separated by movement options out of wavelands
[0:53:51] <%jumbomanlive> @WoolieVersus you can also just press it together
[0:53:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> You can set a shorthop/Longhop button making wavedashing super easy
[0:53:55] <%jumbomanlive> its fine
[0:54:02] <Axmos> you can technically hit them at the same time
[0:54:13] <Solidnick18> dah what?
[0:54:14] <Thunderhog> LUL
[0:54:15] <DiamondStormOwO> med and high levels of play are separated by how many mix ups you have
[0:54:18] <+doubletrouble_sg> LUL
[0:54:21] <+vixenpunch> Imagine kicking your legs so hard that the air around your feet compresses enough that you use it as a platform to jump again

[0:55:22] <Axmos> in this game you can do it like mid way through the plat

[0:58:23] <DiamondStormOwO> lol
[0:58:26] <Goldenwolf98> Woolie hates smash terminology as much as I hate directions being numbers LUL

[0:59:12] <+vixenpunch> You don’t need this depth to play, but you have that depth available
[0:59:22] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Rivals you literally can just hold a direction for SDI @WoolieVersus
[1:00:04] <animailistic> @Prevot it's all about whats easier to understand for you man, some people spacial awareness is better than dexterity naturally. However, motions are easy and they are legit babys

[1:17:59] <ZakosDryiakk> LOL
[1:18:16] <+doubletrouble_sg> I like calling this game the Skullgirls of platform fighters.
[1:18:21] <Djinnazz> AGREED.
[1:18:23] <animailistic> I would say smash is more anime just because the toolkits are gibberish
[1:18:24] <Nevereatcars> 100
[1:18:24] <+doubletrouble_sg> Agreed Woolie
[1:18:28] <BloodiaMK2> the gold armor is when you wanna flex on your boy
[1:18:30] <Solidnick18> i agree
[1:18:33] <Kalcom> didn't even use it lul
[1:18:33] <Louie_Salmon> But blade strangers did give him the voice.
[1:18:34] <NebulaPurple> Skullgirls is actually a great comparison
[1:18:35] <Kristoffers> He's an alrightassist trophy
[1:18:36] <Thunderhog> Shovel knight is the worst guest chracter in shovel knight
[1:18:37] <Axle13j> teh-ken
[1:18:41] <animailistic> This game has very nitpicked perfect kits by comparison
[1:18:45] <+UnprecedentedStudios> OH NO
[1:18:47] <Thunderhog> King knight is the real chracter of shovel knight
[1:18:51] <Vortigon> Hyper Light Furry
[1:18:51] <+LucentWulf> YO CLAIREN LETS GO
[1:18:54] <TheBrunoZone> If you love smash then you shouldn't sleep on this game. That might be a terrible mistake.
[1:18:56] <%yeknomlive> shovel armor in bloodstained was pretty fun
[1:18:57] <Goldenwolf98> @Louie_Salmon yeah but Blade Strangers is kinda bad LUL
[1:18:59] <DiamondStormOwO> eugh, Clairen
[1:19:00] <+BoxNavy> yellow is your tipper range

[1:19:14] <NebulaPurple> they give you a visual for tipper how clever is that?
[1:19:14] <jubejube56> Lol it is so bad that I only just realized that was a Hyper Light Drifter reference
[1:19:18] <Nekros4442> Has Woolie commented on the SF5 netcode fix mod that got released on PC?
[1:19:20] <@Menitta> I'm not a fan of Hyper light drifter
[1:19:23] <xiccy> shes one of 2 characters with a command grab
[1:19:39] <%Wool> Menitta isn't a fan of many things
[1:19:39] <Axmos> i think she was pre hyper light drifter tbh
[1:19:50] <@Menitta> No, the character in this game
[1:19:50] <@akuda_bar> @menitta never talk to me
[1:19:53] <+zeebeebdj> how you liking the game?
[1:19:55] <Nevereatcars> this clairen player's got f l o w
[1:20:00] <BackwardCap> If you hit with the different colored tip of Clairen's Sword it will paralyze them.
[1:20:01] <GigaBowserRoA> look at em go
[1:20:03] <amychibi> Dear Woolie i really love your content. i wanted to ask you. have played recently darkest dungeon with the latest dlc they released?
[1:20:06] <@Menitta> I love the actual game of Hyper light drifter
[1:20:10] <NebulaPurple> doesn't matter it's the same synthwave color scheme and aesthetic either wat
[1:20:12] <NebulaPurple> way*
[1:20:15] <@akuda_bar> oh ok. you're spared
[1:20:19] <%jumbomanlive> Clairen is frustrating to fight against
[1:20:21] <+BoxNavy> Clap\

[1:20:43] <NebulaPurple> cheeks*
[1:20:56] <@Menitta> @Wool yes thats what I said. Clearly
[1:20:58] <animailistic> Clairien is probably the easiest character to play, but the hardest to win with
[1:21:03] <+zeebeebdj> @axmos zeebeeZeebWink

[1:23:14] <+zeebeebdj> more like shiek in a frog suit
[1:23:15] <BloodiaMK2> Coqui?
[1:23:18] <Kristoffers> this frog is siiiick
[1:23:34] <+jonblu10> lol he's barking
[1:23:35] <animailistic> Ranno used to be broken, but now hes alright
[1:23:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sexy fish man?
[1:23:37] <Milo_Oda> what the fuck am i looking at
[1:23:39] <Goldenwolf98> Mash regular attack after Up b
[1:23:45] <DiamondStormOwO> Ranno is cooler Sheik I'd say
[1:23:47] <animailistic> the game is pretty 5-5 these days
[1:23:49] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @WoolieVersus You have follow ups from Up B.
[1:23:50] <Saltmeisterr> up b is a multi attack
[1:23:51] <BackwardCap> You can hold Ranno's up-b to do a spin attack or press down b to dive kick
[1:23:52] <@Menitta> I can easily see how Ranno was broken
[1:23:53] <@akuda_bar> Pokemon battle
[1:23:58] <+zeebeebdj> ^
[1:24:06] <Thunderhog> A bit of sheik, a bit of greninja, and some sick as bubbles
[1:24:14] <@akuda_bar> these sprites are gorgeous
[1:24:14] <%gatorafan> I'd catch these two
[1:24:15] <BloodiaMK2> Disco Ninja Frog
[1:24:18] <DiamondStormOwO> you don't hold UpB, you press the normal butto
[1:24:20] <DiamondStormOwO> n
[1:24:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> is the bubble for command grab set ups or something?
[1:24:26] <BloodiaMK2> oh wait, wrong game
[1:24:33] <DiamondStormOwO> the bubble is for comboes
[1:24:34] <+zeebeebdj> bubble has a lot of uses
[1:24:34] <animailistic> The bubble lets you do bigger combos
[1:24:36] <DiamondStormOwO> and stuff
[1:24:43] <+BoxNavy> bubble looks to get you a free hit
[1:24:43] <animailistic> and set up big spikes
[1:24:44] <Nevereatcars> @WoolieVersus do ranno up b mash light attack
[1:24:49] <+zeebeebdj> u can also use dair on it to recover or stall
[1:24:50] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @WoolieVersus Hit basic attack after Up B
[1:24:59] <animailistic> it gets you one free hit for each toxin charge on the opponent
[1:25:19] <Nevereatcars> both characters hit basic attack after up b
[1:25:29] <GigaBowserRoA> not sylv
[1:25:32] <NebulaPurple> lol what are sylvanos mains jsut downsmash their recovery dude like close your eyes, just combo them

[1:26:08] <Axle13j> LOL
[1:26:08] <NebulaPurple> I like your character, he's combo food
[1:26:09] <Axle13j> nice
[1:26:10] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:26:13] <ZakosDryiakk> Grass desync tho
[1:26:15] <NebulaPurple> when he's not zoning me
[1:26:16] <BackwardCap> You can angle Sylvano's Bair up and down
[1:26:16] <Solidnick18> even game
[1:26:21] <GigaBowserRoA> grass desync kinda hype
[1:26:25] <+arcielardor> Would you call that guy a timber-wolf?
[1:26:25] <Saltmeisterr> is there a way to check movelists in game?
[1:26:37] <animailistic> I forgot that sylvanos is the most beautiful character ever
[1:26:38] <GigaBowserRoA> there are character specific tutorials
[1:26:41] <Kalcom> you can corin with it
[1:26:45] <+Rararachan> Man, I wasn't expecting this game to be so legit
[1:26:52] <GigaBowserRoA> this game is so fucking good
[1:26:55] <Kristoffers> Okami shit goingon
[1:26:56] <MirtosC8> look, a low tier trash character that just win with gimmicks... and sylvanos
[1:26:57] <ZakosDryiakk> ^
[1:26:58] <@Menitta> What does Ranno's down B do
[1:27:08] <NebulaPurple> ye and like 3 moves have special inputs, so you don't really need a movelist, it'd be nice tho
[1:27:10] <DiamondStormOwO> this game is almost the perfect platform fighter
[1:27:17] <NebulaPurple> Ranno DownB sets bubble
[1:27:21] <animailistic> no, it is perfect
[1:27:22] <+Rararachan> F

[1:29:10] <Nevereatcars> hey everyone if you're going to Genesis 7 you can add rivals FOR FREE for about THREE MORE HOURS

[1:33:30] <Goldenwolf98> good thing you can turn off stage hazards in this game
[1:33:34] <BloodiaMK2> She reminds me of Tron Bonne
[1:33:34] <Saltmeisterr> Snek is Snake/BJ

[1:33:57] <NebulaPurple> also her missiles are pit arrows, but 100x better, broke
[1:33:58] <@Menitta> Anything slightly goof is broken
[1:34:02] <GigaBowserRoA> best part of this game is everyone is viable at a competitive level
[1:34:06] <NebulaPurple> and charged it's actually a kill move, please nerf
[1:34:07] <Saltmeisterr> Elli is super techincal
[1:34:08] <@Menitta> and should be bant
[1:34:09] <ZakosDryiakk> Kappa
[1:34:13] <MirtosC8> everyone is good
[1:34:13] <@Menitta> Kappa
[1:34:15] <+cawi> hold b when a cloud is out.
[1:34:15] <%jumbomanlive> For Eliana you gotta overheat to get access to regular smashes
[1:34:15] <MirtosC8> except ori
[1:34:18] <GigaBowserRoA> Everyone is busted
[1:34:19] <Saltmeisterr> but seems very fun once u get good as her
[1:34:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> goat girl reminds me of like Pikachu x Mewtwo
[1:34:24] <animailistic> elli's skill floor is most people's skill ceiling
[1:34:25] <@Menitta> Awwwww I wanted to get Ori
[1:34:25] <BloodiaMK2> @Menitta I just noticed the Reboot sub icon PogChamp
[1:34:28] <DiamondStormOwO> Everyone is busted, yes
[1:34:44] <laserbeaming> Everyone is also very fun to play
[1:34:45] <MirtosC8> ori is the coolest character
[1:34:45] <%Wool> PogChamp
[1:34:49] <MirtosC8> so much fun to plat
[1:34:49] <BloodiaMK2> Woolie has good taste
[1:34:51] <MirtosC8> play
[1:35:00] <hamahiroyuki> the Mecha is like a fusion of the new grass starter with chestnought? pretty cool
[1:35:06] <Nevereatcars> he's got those elli plays
[1:35:08] <+arcielardor> Yare Yare
[1:35:10] <animailistic> no one is busted, all characters are less isoteric and less cluncky than smash, so it feels stronger on offense, but its a fair game
[1:35:26] <+BoxNavy> dude i wanna drop smash for this
[1:35:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:35:27] <DSD24> That is Zelda's move
[1:35:28] <GigaBowserRoA> no one is busted because everyone is busted
[1:35:29] <+BoxNavy> it looks so fun
[1:35:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Zelda as an up air explosion I think
[1:35:29] <Saltmeisterr> mewtwo
[1:35:32] <DiamondStormOwO> everyone is busted, so it evens it out
[1:35:37] <Solidnick18> orcane PogChamp
[1:35:38] <Nevereatcars> LET'S GO MAYPUL
[1:35:38] <Vortigon> Character design is kind of hit or miss
[1:35:40] <LoneFonte> @rooooooooooot ONE OF US
[1:35:44] <Kalcom> yes mewtwo, the one with a skirt
[1:35:45] <Nevereatcars> one of us
[1:35:46] <@Menitta> I still prefer Smash but this is a very fun game
[1:35:47] <hamahiroyuki> oh now I noticed the shymin pallate
[1:35:49] <Kristoffers> I'll say
[1:35:58] <TheBrunoZone> No one is unbalanced if every character is broken
[1:35:58] <animailistic> better design does not equal unfair
[1:35:58] <Kristoffers> but yeah
[1:35:59] <%jumbomanlive> I mean
[1:36:00] <Kristoffers> seems fun
[1:36:01] <+BoxNavy> @LoneFonte dude ultimate has been pissing me off so i need something new lol
[1:36:07] <Nivrap> 'better design'
[1:36:07] <%jumbomanlive> this game is fun
[1:36:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I for got the whale has paws, I hate it
[1:36:10] <MirtosC8> after 1 month playing this game i can't play smash anymore

[1:36:30] <animailistic> I beg the stream chat to drop smash for this, Ive been begging people for years
[1:36:32] <NebulaPurple> sneed
[1:36:35] <Saltmeisterr> its still just smash
[1:36:37] <+cawi> the seed has to connect
[1:36:37] <Nivrap> no, smash is fun
[1:36:37] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @WoolieVersus Seed the opponent then up be

[1:37:27] <+SinisterBroccoli> lol is this an ori map
[1:37:34] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[1:37:36] <MirtosC8> yeah
[1:37:37] <Nevereatcars> they're not reading chat jumbo
[1:37:37] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @GigaBowserRoA
[1:37:38] <laserbeaming> It is
[1:37:40] <+UnprecedentedStudios> He figured it out PogChamp
[1:37:40] <Kristoffers> I'd know the trailer owl anywhere
[1:37:41] <TheBrunoZone> @BloodiaMK2 See, this guy gets it.
[1:37:44] <Nevereatcars> yeah giga very rude
[1:37:50] <GigaBowserRoA> smh smh
[1:37:51] <animailistic> having to buy tower of heaven again when the game left early access was the dumbest
[1:37:54] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Heck Giga can't do his trademarked yelling
[1:37:54] <BloodiaMK2> @TheBrunoZone You know it SeemsGood
[1:38:00] <+waltzqueen> M O I S T
[1:38:02] <MirtosC8> what a bad person this giga
[1:38:10] <GigaBowserRoA> yeah what an asshole
[1:38:23] <animailistic> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[1:38:26] <ZakosDryiakk> Do I hear a moneymatch?
[1:38:28] <GigaBowserRoA> I bet his neck is the size of a monolith
[1:38:31] <Nevereatcars> @WoolieVersus hold to tether
[1:38:31] <ZakosDryiakk> Kappa
[1:38:33] <Nivrap> It's kinda weird to say
[1:38:41] <Nivrap> 'play this instead of ultimate'
[1:38:51] <Goldenwolf98> Whens Woolie gonna stream Ori tho?
[1:38:55] <Kristoffers> gross
[1:38:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> goo nair
[1:38:57] <BloodiaMK2> Whip it good
[1:38:58] <Kristoffers> wet fight
[1:39:00] <Nivrap> when they're both so different, even as platform fighters
[1:39:03] <animailistic> Woolie Nuts on reggie, not experienced enough to know what to do next
[1:39:17] <+doubletrouble_sg> I prefer this game over Smash Ultimate.
[1:39:20] <@Solidus_113> Why would you ever play an homage game when the original still exists
[1:39:22] <@Squdnate> HahaShrugRight
[1:39:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octo200IQ
[1:39:27] <+Grayhammatter> it AIN't SAFE
[1:39:36] <%jumbomanlive> Because this game is more fun
[1:39:37] <Nevereatcars> because the original dev hates us
[1:39:42] <GigaBowserRoA> because its a different game
[1:39:42] <Saltmeisterr> i also wanna see more platform fighters that aren't just smash clones
[1:39:43] <%jumbomanlive> lol
[1:39:48] <NebulaPurple> more balanced, more fun, mod support
[1:39:52] <Nivrap> they're completely different, you can play both
[1:39:54] <@Menitta> It reminds me of "shut up and play Warframe"
[1:39:55] <Saltmeisterr> which is why im excite for Duel Arms
[1:39:55] <Nevereatcars> @Saltmeisterr roof rage is amazing
[1:39:57] <ZakosDryiakk> Workshop
[1:39:57] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @Saltmeisterr There's alot of those out there lol
[1:39:59] <Cykron> Is this the Woolie Furry arch?
[1:40:00] <ZakosDryiakk> Period

[1:40:04] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeyeye

[1:40:19] <Kalcom> ok now workshop
[1:40:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> way to Squirt it out, Reggie
[1:40:20] <+Gamefriendly> LUL
[1:40:26] <Saltmeisterr> roof rage looks cool
[1:40:27] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, they're gonna get blown up
[1:40:28] <%jumbomanlive> aye lets go

[1:40:32] <Cykron> Squirt to survive
[1:40:33] <preppyposs> WHICH IS REAL BTW
[1:40:34] <%Wool> squirt to survive
[1:40:34] <Saltmeisterr> but Duel Arms tho
[1:40:34] <NinjaGentleman> I still think Slap city is the best smash clone atm
[1:40:35] <masterfire23> squirt to survive Kreygasm
[1:40:41] <NebulaPurple> Lovers of aether is legit
[1:40:43] <DiamondStormOwO> > smash clone lol
[1:40:47] <BloodiaMK2> Does this game have an equivalent to Final Destination?
[1:40:47] <ModelZer0> Rivals is easier to pick up, but the neutral is comprised of a lot of 50/50s, so if you're not a fan of that other platform fighters are the way to go
[1:40:50] <animailistic> the april fools patch ah jeez
[1:40:50] <NebulaPurple> people don't know but Rivals is a spinoff of a dating sim
[1:40:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> No lobbies woolie
[1:40:57] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Online monkaS
[1:40:59] <Nivrap> I prefer neutral in Ult, I'm not a fan of melee's style
[1:41:02] <%Wool> just hope to match with us lmao
[1:41:07] <Vortigon> @NebulaPurple get outta here
[1:41:10] <BloodiaMK2> @NebulaPurple I thought that was an April Fools Joke monkaS
[1:41:11] <+cawi> I have this, but never played online.
[1:41:15] <Kalcom> how about doing workshop
[1:41:17] <NebulaPurple> it's an actual game on steam
[1:41:19] <@Squdnate> lol why play mvci, gg, sfv, t7 or any figthan, they are just rip off of SF2 the OG ResidentSleeper the fuck are people talking about
[1:41:21] <jubejube56> 528 steam friends!
[1:41:22] <%Wool> just set an obscure region
[1:41:24] <Man_in_the_Red> @nebulapurple Kappa
[1:41:24] <Saltmeisterr> no lobbies WutFace
[1:41:26] <NebulaPurple> Elliana is best girl btw
[1:41:26] <+Dimfish> workshops a lot of fun too
[1:41:33] <GigaBowserRoA> there are lobbies its only 1v1s tho
[1:41:33] <NinjaGentleman> online mode is going to be a mess
[1:41:35] <Nevereatcars> nice snipe jumbo

[1:41:57] <BloodiaMK2> @WoolieVersus Doesn't Kragg have a special palette?
[1:42:04] <Nivrap> smash people can only comprehend playing one game at a time LUL
[1:42:06] <@Squdnate> @Man_in_the_Red Exactly
[1:42:06] <%gatorafan> huh? People were saying there were lobbies a while ago when we were talking about workshop characters. daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:42:11] <%Wool> what region are y'all set to? East Coast?
[1:42:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> clean stock fuck
[1:42:12] <+Gamefriendly> can this game do teams online? cause that'd be fun to see
[1:42:13] <GigaBowserRoA> Every character has one or more special skins
[1:42:14] <Cykron> Nice Beetle Boi

[1:43:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> just missed that spike, Jumbo
[1:43:08] <Saltmeisterr> Jumbo i better see an etalus dunk
[1:43:27] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @GigaBowserRoA You still have to add people as friends tho which was Woolie's gripe with it
[1:43:31] <TheBrunoZone> Smash players are a bunch of cowards that usually refuse to adapt to different games, except for M2K, Wizzrobe and Leffen
[1:43:33] <%gatorafan> k, thanks for clearing things up
[1:43:41] <+skylerpilot> are they playing on steam?
[1:43:44] <NebulaPurple> Mang0 quite likes this game iirc

[1:44:24] <GigaBowserRoA> you can still hit people with taunts on spawn plat too lol
[1:44:25] <BloodiaMK2> They perfected the jank with that game
[1:44:27] <NebulaPurple> slap city looks bad but plays like a dream iirc
[1:44:33] <GigaBowserRoA> Kragg and SK can hit on the spawn platform with taunt
[1:44:45] <Cykron> Jumbo remind Woolie of why he’ll never go pro 4Head
[1:44:49] <ModelZer0> Slap city has really solid movement but the character archetypes are pretty out there

[1:52:39] <Saltmeisterr> is the game mostly 5-5 4-6 matchups?
[1:52:45] <GigaBowserRoA> mhm mostly
[1:52:46] <Nevereatcars> we think so
[1:52:48] <Cykron> This was a Pokemon fighter before it got copywrite struck
[1:52:50] <animailistic> I would say its all 5-5
[1:52:58] <laserbeaming> The flowers keep the grass from banishing
[1:53:06] <Axmos> @Cykron thats not true?
[1:53:07] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @Saltmeisterr With the rare 7-3 I'm pretty sure yeah
[1:53:10] <GigaBowserRoA> 50-50, 55-45, and 60-40 at absolute worst
[1:53:11] <animailistic> maybe 6-4 Fors-elli but thats it
[1:53:20] <Cykron> @axmos It’s not
[1:53:25] <GigaBowserRoA> Sylv v zetter is 60-40
[1:53:30] <%Shadowwize> Shadowwize subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[1:54:11] <Kalcom> isn't he low tier?
[1:54:12] <DiamondStormOwO> Giga plays Sylv
[1:54:13] <DiamondStormOwO> sp....
[1:54:19] <GigaBowserRoA> Best in the business
[1:54:19] <ZakosDryiakk> There are two sylv mains here
[1:54:21] <Nevereatcars> giga is the top sylv player BY DEFAULT
[1:54:25] <ZakosDryiakk> So the legend says
[1:54:31] <GigaBowserRoA> Sylv is often considered at the bottom lol
[1:54:41] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Yeah Giga is the best Sylv
[1:54:43] <animailistic> my point remains, sylv isnt played by like anyone
[1:54:45] <DiamondStormOwO> Sylv needs more players tbh
[1:54:46] <GigaBowserRoA> Not unviable by any means, but the least good
[1:54:49] <+UnprecedentedStudios> I'm the second best Kappa
[1:54:52] <@akuda_bar> sylvanos looks like a scrunt
[1:54:53] <Goldenwolf98> No hazards online I think
[1:54:56] <Axmos> no hazards on the legal versions
[1:54:59] <animailistic> and im a clair main for christs sake
[1:55:03] <GigaBowserRoA> he definitely does but the people who do play em push em super hard
[1:55:05] <Nevereatcars> @WoolieVersus hazards aren't part of the game. you guys had a setting wrong.
[1:55:07] <Axmos> you can turn legal version on local
[1:55:09] <NebulaPurple> Sylv nair is so fun
[1:55:26] <NebulaPurple> almost as fun as DA Kappa
[1:55:29] <+bootysteve> angle the squirt reggie

[1:55:42] <@akuda_bar> Angle the Squirt
[1:55:44] <GigaBowserRoA> I am tho
[1:55:51] <%razielhex> turtle the squirtle
[1:55:56] <Cykron> Angle that squirt. It helps if you pinch the tip
[1:55:58] <GigaBowserRoA> best sylv in the business
[1:55:58] <animailistic> Literal Shout of Earth bois rise up
[1:56:02] <PsycheKit> Why is nobody playing Ronald
[1:56:05] <Vortigon> Why are hazards not available online?
[1:56:16] <NebulaPurple> cause online is mostly for comp
[1:56:17] <Axmos> its a competitive game
[1:56:20] <GigaBowserRoA> ^
[1:56:21] <NebulaPurple> they will be in definitive edition
[1:56:28] <Nevereatcars> they will?
[1:56:30] <PsycheKit> oh right online
[1:56:34] <masterfire23> the workshop characters for this game look ridiculous LUL
[1:56:34] <DiamondStormOwO> you can turn them on
[1:56:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:56:36] <ZakosDryiakk> Afaik yeah
[1:56:37] <@akuda_bar> orca pupy
[1:56:41] <@Menitta> lmao I have had nothing but under water matches
[1:56:42] <Vortigon> Why are hazards not for competitive? Aren't they consistent?
[1:56:45] <+Grayhammatter> got caught stepping in the squirt
[1:56:45] <GigaBowserRoA> mhm they will there are a bunch of settings you can change even in casual
[1:56:45] <NebulaPurple> ye, in the workshop branch there's alreadya setting to turn them on
[1:56:46] <DiamondStormOwO> on the new netcode7
[1:56:48] <animailistic> >alpharad makes like 4 meme vids >wheres 100% accurate ronald mcdio
[1:56:50] <GigaBowserRoA> but they have to agree with it
[1:56:58] <NebulaPurple> ye but they're still busted, and the aether mode can also change stage layout
[1:57:02] <ZakosDryiakk> @masterfire23 olympia, astra, trummel and pomme
[1:57:06] <TheBrunoZone> This "Definitive Edition" will be updated on other platforms as well or is it just a Switch thingy?
[1:57:06] <NebulaPurple> like, Aetehr Tower of Heaven is disgusting
[1:57:09] <ZakosDryiakk> You can check the rest l8r
[1:57:13] <NebulaPurple> it'd be permaban
[1:57:24] <Nevereatcars> @Vortigon you'd have to see some of the worse stage hazards to understand
[1:57:27] <Nevereatcars> some of them instakill

[1:57:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Stop standin in puddles yo
[1:57:50] <ZakosDryiakk> Oh and mollo
[1:57:50] <NebulaPurple> Treetop is really bad, Tower is really bad
[1:57:51] <Nevereatcars> by deciding they wouldn't need to be part of the competitive balance from the beginning, the devs could focus on making them fun
[1:57:53] <Saltmeisterr> Slyv's aether stage is a oof from me

[2:11:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> go menitta
[2:11:08] <Axmos> they are only finding people they know almost

[2:11:31] <+Grayhammatter> go menitta!
[2:11:31] <PsycheKit> Nah @Axmos casual is usually pretty dead so majority of players will be people watching the stream
[2:11:42] <NebulaPurple> the official rivals discord has a bunch of regional servers linked in the rules
[2:11:44] <animailistic> I dont use it much anymore but its great
[2:11:46] <Axmos> but its not

[2:12:06] <PsycheKit> Right now? It's alive because of people wanting to play with these guys
[2:12:11] <@Solidus_113> They need to get a way to completely allow Workshop characters and have them download while in character select
[2:12:29] <%Wool> fuck I'm an idiot, I was searching for him on the Workshop build, not default
[2:12:33] <%Wool> no wonder why I wasn't getting matched
[2:12:36] <NebulaPurple> that'd be neat
[2:12:45] <Saltmeisterr> wow menetta
[2:12:45] <PsycheKit> Workshop characters are legal online on the workshop beta but it'd be nice to have autodownload on random matchmade games
[2:13:07] <Kalcom> but workshop when tho
[2:13:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm comming back for them hands fucker
[2:13:26] <NebulaPurple> Ultimate is STINKY! Buy Rivals Instead!

[2:17:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:17:45] <Kalcom> no pillar
[2:17:49] <@Menitta> this game is weird but kind of awesome
[2:17:57] <+universepenguin> yea I love this game
[2:18:20] <Nivrap> Does Reggie know that Zetter's smash attacks do extra knockback if the enemy is on fire?
[2:18:23] <%jumbomanlive> @WoolieVersus Im playing on PS4 controller BTW
[2:18:29] <%jumbomanlive> If I was on Gamecube controller
[2:18:32] <%jumbomanlive> ooooooweeeeee
[2:18:36] <@Menitta> I need a USB gamecube controller
[2:18:38] <jubejube56> Lol seems kinda impossible for a newbie to learn online
[2:18:50] <jubejube56> Feels so much like one touch deaths
[2:19:02] <%Wool> getting matched up is so hard :'(
[2:19:04] <BackwardCap> Yes you can, I'm doing it right now.
[2:19:05] <@Menitta> Oh yeah the adapter is USB
[2:19:18] <Milo_Oda> combo get!
[2:19:18] <+universepenguin> yea if you download the drivers you can use the wii u adapter
[2:19:27] <TheBrunoZone> Dude, the moment you start playing rivals on a gamecube controller the world around you shapes itself
[2:19:45] <+universepenguin> funny you say that, most of the top players use xbone
[2:19:45] <DiamondStormOwO> bruh, just play on a keyboard
[2:19:45] <@Menitta> I wanna play this with a DDR pad
[2:19:49] <Nivrap> does the Switch adapter work as well?
[2:20:11] <+universepenguin> yea, as far as I know they're the same thing outside of cosmetic appearance @Nivrap
[2:20:30] <TheBrunoZone> The xbone controller is more stick oriented, so I wouldn't be surprised
[2:20:47] <@Menitta> I was using an Xbox Elite controller
[2:20:49] <@Menitta> Felt weird
[2:20:57] <animailistic> nah dudes its all about k-e-y-b-o-a-r-d

[2:37:06] <animailistic> sorry im also playing rivals whilst coming in here randomly
[2:37:11] <Tohisu> "Mmh!"
[2:37:19] <+universepenguin> I'm debating who to play if I get the snipe
[2:37:20] <%Wool> has Woolie actually bought something or has he only opened the menu
[2:37:22] <%FeltSn0wman> you can buy on the respawn platform im p sure
[2:37:24] <Kalcom> nope
[2:37:30] <+oberon123> go forsburn
[2:37:34] <Saltmeisterr> damn dude this game so sick
[2:37:36] <Kalcom> he hasn't bought anything
[2:37:36] <+oberon123> just go for crazy mindgames
[2:37:40] <animailistic> Penguin just play some jank
[2:37:44] <old_dog_god> Why is Woolie buying powerups from himself
[2:37:46] <KSDM> Play Snek
[2:37:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, EVO needs to do another charity game for main stage so we can FORCE skullgirls to be played on main stage.
[2:37:47] <Saltmeisterr> can't wait for switch version
[2:37:51] <+universepenguin> what if I just spam shine with zetter
[2:37:57] <KSDM> I can't wait for rollback
[2:38:01] <+oberon123> didnt they say theyd never let it be at evo
[2:38:02] <animailistic> Ive seen enough footage of you to know your in the stratosphere compared to these guys just play with them
[2:38:23] <+Shoosler> lol
[2:38:31] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KSDM
[2:38:32] <%jumbomanlive> lol
[2:38:38] <%jumbomanlive> gg
[2:38:41] <%jumbomanlive> i played like shit
[2:38:41] <KSDM> Straight up Pasta Fazole that last much
[2:38:50] <Kalcom> somehow, woolie wins without buying
[2:38:56] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Considering the state of Melee, I wouldn't do that if I were you
[2:38:57] <animailistic> Actually just show off how ranno works for them if possible
[2:39:00] <+oberon123> penguin im vs you LOL
[2:39:01] <%Wool> HHHAHA
[2:39:02] <Solidnick18> come on wool
[2:39:03] <Solidnick18> YEEE
[2:39:04] <%jumbomanlive> im rusty with Sylvanos
[2:39:05] <+universepenguin> fuck
[2:39:07] <+Grayhammatter> ye
[2:39:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone why?
[2:39:08] <Axmos> smh
[2:39:09] <@Menitta> Eyyy he got it
[2:39:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> good for wool
[2:39:14] <+oberon123> run it coward
[2:39:22] <@Menitta> destroy him
[2:39:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:23] <+universepenguin> how much I gotta dono for a bo5 lol
[2:39:43] <%jumbomanlive> @Menitta lets play
[2:39:46] <Axmos> he'll do it
[2:39:55] <animailistic> it starts with getting online i guess boss
[2:39:59] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Because since it got pulled from the main stage, I bet you the next charity they will dominate the polls again
[2:40:13] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:40:20] <TheBrunoZone> And personally, I REALLY want skullgirls to be at EVO
[2:40:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone yeah but if it's a charity stream, it's literally anybodies game, cause umvc3 could raise the funds or skullgirls, either or honestly
[2:41:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> if melee raised it then they deserve it
[2:41:26] <animailistic> Skullgirls does well enough, combo breaker is the new evo anyway
[2:41:32] <+cawi> smash attacks when the opponent is on fire adds knockback
[2:41:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> is it?
[2:41:36] <+Grayhammatter> clapped
[2:41:50] <+universepenguin> when on fire zetter smash attacks have a 1.5x multiplier on knockback
[2:41:50] <animailistic> we need Rivals to get on a big stage thats not smash shaped
[2:42:04] <Kalcom> NO ITEMS
[2:42:06] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver You have a point. But yet, melee has won already a spot via charity streams, and it got featured on the documental
[2:42:11] <Kalcom> FOX ONLY
[2:42:15] <PsycheKit> just make Treetop Lodge tourney legal
[2:42:18] <%Ecchigun> lets go reggieee
[2:42:22] <+universepenguin> it is @PsychReality
[2:42:24] <PsycheKit> Or no, Bamboo whatever
[2:42:26] <Solidnick18> hell yeah
[2:42:27] <PsycheKit> The Guadua stage
[2:42:28] <Axmos> it is thou
[2:42:30] <Thunderhog> NO ITEMS NO LASERS
[2:42:30] <+universepenguin> oh
[2:42:32] <Axmos> or lol
[2:42:36] <+universepenguin> there are too many platforms on that thing lol
[2:42:48] <Axmos> make big forest floor a CP
[2:42:49] <+universepenguin> we have enough stages in the meantime
[2:42:51] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Plus, knowing the grudge melee players have torwards EVO, I can guarantee you they'll vote for it again LUL
[2:42:54] <PsycheKit> I mostly agree but its at least a unique big stage
[2:43:15] <lem______> wait evos doin charity again?
[2:43:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[2:43:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> but i want them to
[2:43:34] <+oberon123> they wont
[2:43:39] <%chronoxgp> i was playing cuphead today that game is nuts
[2:43:42] <+oberon123> because melee would win and thats not something they want LOL
[2:43:43] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[2:43:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone with that in mind there's also plenty of people who would spite vote against it
[2:43:54] <Saltmeisterr> cuphhead is great
[2:44:00] <CirclesForever> which one is pikachu
[2:44:02] <lem______> also just sounds like a way to breed animosity between games
[2:44:10] <Saltmeisterr> probably in my top ten
[2:44:11] <+oberon123> as if there isnt enough already
[2:44:19] <lem______> thats what happened last time
[2:44:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> did it?
[2:44:35] <%Wool> gg lmao
[2:44:37] <%chronoxgp> cup head is like contra, star wars and looneytunes/jazz in one.
[2:44:40] <@Solidus_113> 0-2
[2:44:45] <%asgard147> gg limesYay
[2:44:48] <@Solidus_113> BUT IT WAS CLOSE
[2:44:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHEN'S THE JANK
[2:44:53] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Boy, trust me, they would do ANYTHING to have Melee back at EVO main stage
[2:44:55] <Solidnick18> gg
[2:45:07] <Kalcom> ok but worshop tho
[2:45:10] <+universepenguin> @WoolieVersus how much I gotta dono for a bo5 lol
[2:45:14] <KSDM> ABSA Kreygasm
[2:45:17] <+ItsSleepyBoi> regardless if melee comes back to evo, nothing much would change in the scene
[2:45:24] <Axmos> he'll do it
[2:45:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone i mean, i guess, idk why, i'd rather have a slot at combo breaker honestly
[2:45:28] <%Wool> man that took way too much work to get matched lmao
[2:45:28] <DedlokPM> they have a wooloo with them. rooAww
[2:45:30] <old_dog_god> What is this Sonic Advance main menu
[2:45:35] <Solidnick18> the scene will be the same
[2:45:39] <+Dimfish> absas fucking rad, show him the real shit
[2:45:41] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit a sheep
[2:45:46] <PsycheKit> Wait this guy's a real player hold on
[2:45:47] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[2:45:47] <amavii> absa is just pm zelda right?
[2:45:49] <%asgard147> SourPls
[2:45:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> welp this match is basically over
[2:45:51] <lem______> does lamb do anything?
[2:45:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is a real player
[2:45:55] <+LucentWulf> absa is radical to play
[2:45:55] <KSDM> Absa is basically Ness, Mewtwo, and Pikachu
[2:45:59] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Exactly. Focus on other majors.
[2:46:01] <Saltmeisterr> oh boi woolie getting bodied
[2:46:03] <PsycheKit> Absa is Pikachu Zelda Jigglypuff
[2:46:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Datwiseguy no, i think it's just a background thing
[2:46:09] <+Dimfish> id say absa more ness and zelda but yeah
[2:46:13] <Axmos> how is she ness or jiggly
[2:46:16] <animailistic> boomer woolie doesnt understand a literal expert in trying to get on the stream rn
[2:46:18] <Kalcom> easy prey
[2:46:21] <KSDM> Dair, DJC
[2:46:25] <PsycheKit> Jiggly's air mobility/floatiness
[2:46:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:46:26] <amavii> shes got that ness dj
[2:46:34] <LoneFonte> dear lord
[2:46:35] <Axmos> dair has a sweet spot
[2:46:39] <KSDM> Dair is literally the same frame data as PM ness Dair
[2:46:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone EVO is big cause it's the most known so it's nice if you're a new game there cause everybody goes, but if you want a more fun time, go to combobreaker
[2:46:40] <animailistic> Literally top 3 talent trying to get in here and nothing
[2:46:42] <sntquinn> how long are you guys playin for?

[2:47:58] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver A lot of players/spectators usaully sleep on CC, and it's one of the most entertaining events FGC wise.
[2:48:10] <%jumbomanlive> @WoolieVersus If im on next time can I face off reggie?
[2:48:19] <KSDM> You can't reflect cloud but it stuns her for like 3 seconds
[2:48:19] <PsycheKit> Alpharad's Absa video is from 1.0 or earlier iirc
[2:48:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone it's the most fun, but not the EVO replacement yet
[2:48:20] <Axmos> @WoolieVersus you got a donation
[2:48:30] <+universepenguin> yea alpha's absa vid is super old
[2:48:32] <amavii> Alpha has a video like that for everyone but the snake
[2:48:32] <KSDM> Early Access
[2:48:42] <TheBrunoZone> CC 2019 was their BEST event so far
[2:48:45] <+cawi> you can tether lightning to the cloud if hold B with it out.
[2:48:46] <+universepenguin> and absa's now play much more differently due to me lol
