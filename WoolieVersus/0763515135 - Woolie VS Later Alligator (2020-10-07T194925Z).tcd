[1:08:22] <+wunp_fxs> boiling lines
[1:08:28] <brachydios777> Fake dog tags is real life Fraud Detected

[1:08:34] <dukenux> yes
[1:08:39] <+SlappyMeats> like Home Movies and shit
[1:08:40] <CrematedCube> Line boil has a charm
[1:08:40] <%Jrockoni> I had a fake dog tag with a bleach character on it. fuuuuck
[1:08:43] <$Jugg4n4ut> ed edd and eddy is the champion of wobble lines
[1:08:45] <sleepy_pixels> it's refered to as boiling

[1:08:48] <+Taglog7> hey, Brendan
[1:08:51] <@Solidus_113> the jitters aren't that difficult to do, it's mostly a setting to do
[1:08:55] <dukenux> oh you're talking about the artstyle, not fashion style
[1:08:55] <$JobbedBone> the dr kats guys have a system for doing this patented
[1:09:03] <$Superdandy96> Very Edd Ed & Eddy like

[1:09:53] <+jiggy_snipe> he has sibling I think
[1:09:55] <+skyheys> some family trees go up
[1:09:56] <@Solidus_113> how do trees work
[1:09:56] <GenkoForrest> he's one of the branches. not the trunk.
[1:09:59] <InspectorWobble> It go up
[1:10:00] <chocobodundee> wouldnt the bottom be the oldest ancestor
[1:10:01] <sendart> bottom up
[1:10:01] <%JetpackMcQuack> How many kids does pat have whipHmm
[1:10:01] <the_super_suit> Woolie doesn't know how a family tree works
[1:10:04] <%R0bobot> this is a family tree
[1:10:16] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> There's an etched out spot monkaS
[1:10:19] <dukenux> yes?
[1:10:19] <the_super_suit> yes
[1:10:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> Family trees weird
[1:10:22] <@Solidus_113> yes?
[1:10:22] <+skyheys> I have
[1:10:22] <CrematedCube> No, that's not how family trees work
[1:10:24] <%hologram_sam> neva
[1:10:24] <dr_healsgood> I got confused too when I tried this
[1:10:26] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah I've seen it like that
[1:10:26] <Vysetron> it's a literal family tree
[1:10:27] <Srthunda> yes
[1:10:30] <spawnzie> e I'm more used to going down
[1:10:31] <%Exiliator> Yeah
[1:10:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tbh most family trees i've seen are like what woolie says
[1:10:32] <the_super_suit> trees grow upward woolie
[1:10:32] <LtThunderbolt> never
[1:10:33] <dukenux> family TREE going down?
[1:10:33] <brachydios777> Dig up stupid
[1:10:33] <%Exiliator> Its the entire family
[1:10:35] <DianaTheAscian> Woolie....
[1:10:35] <$JobbedBone> UM
[1:10:36] <dizimous> it makes more sense
[1:10:43] <CrematedCube> Or, huh, you're right
[1:10:45] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[1:10:46] <DianaTheAscian> Reggie.....
[1:10:49] <+Estuko> SourPls
[1:10:51] <Broand> Start with the mom maybe
[1:10:53] <+SuperKirby24> make circle hole fit good yeayeayea
[1:11:00] <%DreyfussFrost> It makes more sense. I've always seen it with the ancestors at the top but that doesn't make sense as a tree.
[1:11:02] <%Exiliator> I remember checking out the Donald Duck family tree as a kid, Shit was HYPE
[1:11:02] <%JetpackMcQuack> Family trees aren't literal trees guys
[1:11:03] <+jiggy_snipe> most family trees don't have a tree background so they start top to bottom
[1:11:03] <%Solidnick18> family trees are a mess
[1:11:06] <%0rond> family trees that have actual trees as backgrounds are like this. family trees that are just charts are top-down
[1:11:07] <%R0bobot> you have to actually drop it for it to click
[1:11:14] <reonome> you have to drop it woolie
[1:11:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's not a tumbleweed, I don't understand this family tree.
[1:11:28] <lambishly> Real gamers align their family tree Right to Left Kappa
[1:11:31] <%Exiliator> My guess is he's top left
[1:11:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> - has MANY family from the deep south.
[1:11:45] <Duke_of_HI> we brute smarting this?
[1:11:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:11:52] <%R0bobot> no
[1:11:54] <CrematedCube> Logic it out
[1:11:54] <reonome> no its just an annoying minigame lol
[1:11:55] <+GingerStrawhat> You also don't have a huge amount of characters yet Woolz
[1:12:02] <%R0bobot> You know how to put it
[1:12:10] <Vysetron> try putting geraldine on all the high spots
[1:12:11] <spawnzie> i think you just have to click
[1:12:12] <dukenux> I always look at these great Oak family trees with dozens of branches... meanwhile mine would look a slim birch
[1:12:16] <the_super_suit> you don't have enough info just yet. you can come back later
[1:12:24] <+GingerStrawhat> So it's gonna be harder to place someone
[1:12:25] <+skyheys> dude what
[1:12:28] <%DreyfussFrost> "That has no kids" What?
[1:12:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @WoolieVersus The relationships become easier to get when you've met more of the family, I'd put this off for now.
[1:12:30] <tearfuldevil> woolie what are you doing
[1:12:31] <dr_healsgood> think you skipped one
[1:12:32] <+bigb00gi3> it'll stick once you get it right
[1:12:33] <tearfuldevil> what
[1:12:38] <%Exiliator> That one had 3 kids
[1:12:38] <+BeadierCoot> skipped one
[1:12:40] <%hax_metatron> hax_metatron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[1:12:40] <+BeadierCoot> with three kids
[1:12:41] <reonome> you can do it but its just hard
[1:12:42] <+GingerStrawhat> It sticks when you get it right
[1:12:43] <%DreyfussFrost> Skipped 2
[1:12:43] <Hoodywolf> he did skip one
[1:12:44] <%R0bobot> You can do it throughout the game
[1:12:46] <honeyman18> just put it in the right spot
[1:12:46] <tearfuldevil> you skipped 2 woolie
[1:12:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Too early
[1:12:50] <Broand> the branched from the middle of the line is "from both parents"
[1:12:53] <StarMechV> you skipped one woolie
[1:12:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> you aren't too early
[1:12:56] <Thunderhog> You'll need to have met everyone to finish this anyway
[1:12:56] <+SuperKirby24> @R0bobot OwO
[1:13:04] <17sevens> woolie yoou skipped one
[1:13:06] <+GingerStrawhat> Again it's just you don't have too many characters so it's harder to find the right places
[1:13:07] <%DreyfussFrost> You skipped a pair that had 3 kids.
[1:13:10] <CrematedCube> They're somewhere in the center tree
[1:13:11] <17sevens> there is literally one left and you gave up
[1:13:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> you can do it anytime though
[1:13:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> @WoolieVersus You can pop them into place now, but there's no point until you have them all.
[1:13:17] <Railgun5> Literally skipped the right one and said "that can't be it"
[1:13:18] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> SourPls
[1:13:20] <%Livelinne> Later Gator
[1:13:22] <brachydios777> NotLikeThis
[1:13:23] <StarMechV> you have up right at the end woolie

[2:35:15] <+jiggy_snipe> you're goddamn right
[2:35:15] <%brickwall35> I dont do any math with F, Woolie
[2:35:17] <Vysetron> our esoteric temperature measurements are to keep the outsiders uncomfortable
[2:35:17] <@Solidus_113> Hey Woolie how tall are you?
[2:35:17] <Equirah> LUL
[2:35:18] <BlackermanZX> the fucks a farenheit doodBait

[2:35:25] <@akuda_bar> woolie how tall are you
[2:35:26] <acewulf77> the US can't do anything right
[2:35:26] <+goose_attack_almanac> Okay but what about Kelvin
[2:35:30] <@Menitta> remember 1 inch is 2.54 cm
[2:35:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hey WOolie how tall are you
[2:35:33] <+Creggamonsta> america!!!
[2:35:33] <huskarl_zap> zero is freezing
[2:35:33] <+ladomania> too hard to remember 32 and 2112
[2:35:34] <Fdrank> you think a canadian would know that celsius goes below zero
[2:35:35] <LucentWulf> did you hear about the time an airline tried to switch to metric and RAN OUT OF FUEL?
[2:35:36] <@akuda_bar> how tall are u tho
[2:35:37] <%notgarza> doodNo
[2:35:37] <+Rekinsinn> i dunno, water freezing temp is the middle?
[2:35:37] <Indigo_Automaton> You're right, but how tall are you?
[2:35:37] <%Exiliator> Water boils at 100 :)
[2:35:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE NO

[2:35:40] <Duke_of_HI> how tall are you guys?
[2:35:40] <LtThunderbolt> amen
[2:35:41] <%ozzrabbit> I miss metric. Meters, liters, and grams are so much easier.

[2:35:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, how tall
[2:35:43] <%Solidnick18> YEAH AND I LOVE IT

[2:35:50] <Hammatime8> I thought 20 was the middle?
[2:35:50] <Zeemod155> yeah instead we use the system of 0 is the bottom 100 is the top
[2:35:50] <@Menitta> Metric is objectively better.
[2:35:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> Fahrenheit is literally based you fucking non-american üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏

[2:36:24] <spawnzie> WHAT could it be?
[2:36:25] <%Midknightsun316> What's the best password?
[2:36:28] <+harrisboe> Celsius is for smooth-brained people who can‚Äôt figure out that 32 degrees is freezing

[2:36:52] <gunsrlove> If America is so free, why do you still use british measurements Kappa
[2:36:57] <Equirah> @goose_attack_almanac Celcius is at a direct correlation to Kelvin, Farenheit is not
[2:37:00] <@Menitta> thats the easiest way for me to get on a soapbox

[3:00:43] <tearfuldevil> they're great
[3:00:43] <%Proxzo> Sushi burritos are good
[3:00:44] <reonome> they're okay
[3:00:45] <+Taglog7> it's smaller
[3:00:51] <townzzzzz> isn't that just a maki
[3:00:54] <%Livelinne> LUL
[3:00:54] <Vysetron> there's no tortilla, it's basically an uncut sushi roll
[3:00:55] <Srthunda> theres never enough rice in a burrito
[3:00:55] <@akuda_bar> usually seaweed yes, and not much rice at all
[3:00:56] <%Proxzo> It's not tiny
[3:00:56] <%Solidnick18> wonder how that tastes
[3:00:57] <dukenux> @Exiliator Polish, family name Sklodowska, emigrated to France to study on Sorbone. There she met Pierre Curie, which she married.
[3:00:57] <badmr7> its just more complicated handroll
[3:00:59] <AnneSQF> I've had sushi wraps, they were great
[3:01:03] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus their isn't that much rice
[3:01:05] <@Solidus_113> I mean, Futomaki?
[3:01:06] <reonome> its just a fat uncut sushi
[3:01:07] <dukenux> I know this, cause she's the patron of my HS
[3:01:08] <+jiggy_snipe> oh no
[3:01:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It‚Äôs just a hand roll
[3:01:09] <%Exiliator> wait... arent sushi rolls a burrito already?
[3:01:10] <%Livelinne> Sounds like Futomaki
[3:01:11] <SomersaultJustice> I'd eat it
[3:01:17] <CrematedCube> That or you use rice paper instead of seaweed
[3:01:21] <%jinking79> senren kagura
[3:01:21] <Potatoidea> So do they call the ones that started the war insti-gators?
[3:01:23] <DianaTheAscian> oh those things thats what they are called?
[3:01:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> God I love this musiv
[3:01:35] <%Proxzo> Sushi Burritos are stuffed with toppings in a good ratio. Depending on the place you get them. Basically futomaki, but you get stuff like Tuna and Salmon Sashimi
[3:01:40] <reonome> VIVA LA REVOLUTION
[3:01:42] <+gZombiex> Sushiritos are great. they usually have about the same amount of fish meat as a regular burrito
[3:01:43] <%Solidnick18> if you say so
[3:01:44] <TundraOW> KKomrade
[3:01:52] <%Solidnick18> the revolution is televised

[3:04:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> Let's get down to business
[3:04:09] <@Menitta> clarinet is such an underused instrument
[3:04:15] <siampoodle> you have to release/drop to check
[3:04:21] <Funboringness> nah, you just let go of a character in its spot
[3:04:30] <reonome> you should be able to place them, just get lucky lol

[3:06:20] <%Exiliator> woolieONEGUY
[3:06:21] <+toastybites> cuz actual biological trees lol
[3:06:31] <+jiggy_snipe> Family trees with trees start at the bottom, regular chart is top to bottom
[3:06:39] <DianaTheAscian> trees grow from they sky guys god
[3:06:46] <cipher758> lol
[3:06:47] <semisolidsnak3> kk
[3:06:49] <Funboringness> joanie isnt related to pat
[3:06:54] <%brickwall35> every family tree I've ever seen is top to bottom
[3:07:07] <BlackermanZX> guess different tree is different cousins?
[3:07:25] <%Rosewater_444> idk my family tree is sideways
[3:07:35] <%Rosewater_444> right through the prime meridian
[3:07:46] <+linSP> Jared‚Äôs tree isn‚Äôt related I think
[3:07:49] <+jiggy_snipe> lovable doofus lol
[3:07:50] <%Prevot> problem is if actually draw a tree behind it it HAS to go up
[3:07:51] <dizimous> Biotech?
[3:07:51] <BackwardCap> "Biotech"
[3:07:56] <Graxe_> Biotech
[3:07:57] <%Prevot> or it doesnt make sense
[3:08:07] <%Rosewater_444> "It don't go down"
[3:08:18] <%Exiliator> Personal family trees are top to bottom. With the person of connection being at the bottom. But if its a real "family tree", you put the one thats the connection to everyone else (the oldest) at the bottom
[3:08:20] <%Livelinne> Church mom

[3:11:23] <CoffeeSlice> Neat.
[3:11:23] <@akuda_bar> I can understand why that would be.
[3:11:24] <reonome> No.
[3:11:24] <%Prevot> Fuck that.
[3:11:26] <Broand> grammar is rude
[3:11:26] <%Rosewater_444> Hah.

[3:11:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> in text sure
[3:11:28] <IncredibleMeh> no that's pretty much weird bullshit
[3:11:29] <BlackermanZX> huh true
[3:11:29] <%Solidnick18> fuck.

[3:11:36] <RaidenRising> lmao.
[3:11:37] <gunsrlove> Hostility.
[3:11:37] <+Taglog7> Hey. Whoah hold on broh
[3:11:37] <acewulf77> added emphasis of the pause
[3:11:38] <$RunningNGunning> lmao.
[3:11:38] <ChungusQuest> My mom asked me about this phenomenon. It's really hard to explain
[3:11:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> depends on context
[3:11:39] <dukenux> that's interesting.
[3:11:40] <BlackermanZX> fuck that.
[3:11:40] <+jiggy_snipe> speaking proper can also be also
[3:11:42] <%Solidnick18> you sure.
[3:11:43] <dizimous> I'm an older Zoomer I super feel that
[3:11:43] <phatmac16> hu.
[3:11:44] <@Solidus_113> children are dumb.
[3:11:46] <%paladinstarbuster> is that true
[3:11:46] <TundraOW> Actually that's so true
[3:11:47] <RaidenRising> kek.
[3:11:49] <phatmac16> interesting.
[3:11:50] <%Prevot> Sounds like weak baby shit.
[3:11:50] <%Livelinne> Triggered by dot. Kappa
[3:11:52] <%Rosewater_444> Huh.
[3:11:53] <%gatorafan> ...
[3:11:54] <%Solidnick18> pog.
[3:11:54] <acewulf77> z o o m e r
[3:11:55] <%jinking79> Dumb
[3:11:56] <%Exiliator> eh, its language evolution
[3:11:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I see.
[3:11:56] <phatmac16> dumb zoomers.
[3:11:57] <+Exicuren> That sounds like a Cosmopolitan tier BS article.
[3:12:00] <%Rosewater_444> Curious.
[3:12:00] <+DukeBlack_> you've never argue with your mom?
[3:12:01] <@Menitta> remember when lol meant "laughing out loud" and not "this is an indication that this statement is not hostile"
[3:12:03] <mellorolo> i punctuate and dont want to be seen as a improper zoomer..
[3:12:04] <cipher758> Jesus c'mon lol.
[3:12:04] <DianaTheAscian> whats the current gen anyway?
[3:12:10] <acewulf77> lol.
[3:12:10] <RaidenRising> jesus.
[3:12:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> If I was texting my dad and he uses a period then I know its not agressive
[3:12:12] <CoffeeSlice> lol.
[3:12:13] <reonome> @Menitta no lol
[3:12:13] <Potatoidea> I like how we're all using periods now. LOL.
[3:12:14] <phatmac16> lol.
[3:12:16] <%Exiliator> its like if you get a text saying "ok."
[3:12:19] <Broand> It's because they talk in solid blocks like tweets or messages, instead of longform messages like emails and letters
[3:12:19] <acewulf77> l. o. l.
[3:12:24] <Funboringness> Im 19, and thats normal tho, people older than us had limits on what you could text, and we inherited their early work
[3:12:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> @dianatheascian kids born today are Generation Alpha
[3:12:28] <dizimous> Periods are still super essential for mid text sentence ends
[3:12:29] <+Taglog7> you up? lol ;)
[3:12:30] <CrematedCube> ROFL vs Hah. is a sign of the ages
[3:12:31] <AnneSQF> Proper gramma is aggressive.
[3:12:34] <%Solidnick18> ok..
[3:12:37] <Equirah> kids need to write proper sentences confirmed
[3:12:38] <dukenux> Really Reggie..
[3:12:39] <RaidenRising> ok ...
[3:12:39] <Potatoidea> LUL
[3:12:40] <Explodincatz> dot dot dot fear
[3:12:42] <Manwad> I want to be seen as aggressive.
[3:12:43] <$RunningNGunning> what ever you say reggie..
[3:12:43] <dizimous> IF YOU DO A 2 DOT FUCK OFF

[4:31:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> what
[4:31:46] <%Josef_Stryker> I was indoctrinated to write in cursive in Grade 4 and as a result, I'm 24 and my printed handwriting looks like shit
[4:31:50] <AnneSQF> that explains everything
[4:31:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> they taught cursive in like 3rd grade but I never internalized it because I was already struggling to write in print lol
[4:31:54] <heartlesshealer> okay, but shoelaces is a family thing. That's ENTIRELY on your parents

[4:42:40] <%Exiliator> not really
[4:42:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> usually I don't either
[4:42:47] <ikantreeed> shit i never realize, i don't give a fuck either
[4:42:48] <+jennyfurific> i dont pay attention to it either
[4:42:52] <+supportunit> i dont care either
[4:42:53] <tearfuldevil> im white, i don't notice
[4:42:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> That one tribe in new guinea with blonde black people with blue eyes
[4:42:57] <+arancet> am white, never notice
[4:42:58] <dukenux> i dont either, but it's cause i don't look strangers in the eyes
[4:42:59] <BlackermanZX> hell i forget even my eye color doodBait
[4:43:01] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Oh white people, you and your eyes
[4:43:05] <+KENTASHIRO> It's a white woman thing, most white men don't care
[4:43:06] <@akuda_bar> my asian friend thought all white people had blue eyes and he freaked out when he noticed mine are brown
[4:43:09] <heart_ablaze> eye color honestly doesn't matter
[4:43:17] <ChungusQuest> nobody cares unless it's heterochromia
[4:43:19] <BoneBagMel> latinos is kinda 50/50
[4:43:19] <%Exiliator> I have no idea what people around me's eye color is
[4:43:21] <heartlesshealer> eye color tends to be tied to hair color a bit
[4:43:25] <AnneSQF> I got all the recessive genes!!!
[4:43:30] <ikantreeed> Is because white ppl are lowkey maaad mixed. europeans be fucking
[4:43:31] <phatmac16> Sounds like a white women thing
[4:43:34] <IncredibleMeh> its such an innocuous detail and that's why it's a measurement of how much you pay attention to someone
[4:43:37] <+TyrVarg> my wife is brazilian and thought most americans were blonde and blue eyed
[4:43:40] <$RunningNGunning> Pat overacting? Do tell Kappa

[4:48:07] <%guyalex> gotta follow your gut, and play/support the little games you love
[4:48:07] <dukenux> But there was A Yakuza
[4:48:10] <heartlesshealer> 2Mello was there
[4:48:11] <phatmac16> We played yakuza tho
[4:48:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:48:12] <%Exiliator> wouldnt go that far, but yeah it was pretty fun
[4:48:14] <%Lion_kun> Did woolie beat the game?
[4:48:16] <TundraOW> It gives me a reason to buy & play the game
[4:48:19] <%paladinstarbuster> It really wasnt
[4:48:19] <phatmac16> It was a fun game
[4:48:21] <nanonini> such a great game
[4:48:23] <cipher758> alligator are cool
[4:48:23] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> The Alligator fandom is kinda toxic, to be honest
[4:48:30] <+JustToWatch> it was AAA in that there were at least 3 alligators in the game
[4:48:32] <nanonini> so glad you guys played it
[4:48:33] <dukenux> it's also implies and f-word
[4:48:34] <Indigo_Automaton> No complaints, that was an incredible game!
[4:48:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> But Woolie, you didnplay Yakuza today
[4:48:38] <+Captain_Spicy_> LUL
[4:48:39] <SnapdragonSK> it was AAAlligator
[4:48:42] <%Livelinne> LUL
[4:48:44] <dukenux> Triple G
[4:48:48] <ChungusQuest> If you're into indie games as art with some feels on the side, when's Outer Wilds?
[4:48:53] <%Livelinne> E
[4:48:54] <dukenux> for great gator game
[4:49:02] <Terrarp> But we got Yakuza in alligator form
[4:49:04] <chocobodundee> 2nd for Outer Wilds
[4:49:05] <+Taglog7> cant wait to relive it in the podcast
[4:49:07] <+GermBusta> KomodoHype
[4:49:10] <%Lion_kun> the waiting list is so long it took a year for woolie to get to it lol

[4:50:57] <@Solidus_113> baifu
[4:50:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> i like buyfu
[4:51:01] <Terrarp> Buyfu
[4:51:07] <%Livelinne> Buyfu
[4:51:10] <+jiggy_snipe> Baifu isn't obvious
[4:51:12] <%DreyfussFrost> He just posted the poll with no context.
[4:51:15] <%Lion_kun> Baifu looks better woolie
[4:51:17] <%Prevot> no one who sees buyfu will think of the word waifu
[4:51:24] <%DreyfussFrost> So people who weren't watching the stream got votes.
[4:51:28] <%Lion_kun> listen to the will of the people
[4:51:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> buyfu makes so much more sense, when i saw the title this morning i was so confused with the old spelling
[4:51:29] <+linSP> Later-fu
[4:51:33] <%gatorafan> We are dumb daedra1DerpyTibs
[4:51:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if I donate to woolie is woolie a buyfu
[4:51:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @WoolieVersus Did u finish Ultrakill off screen? (You REALLY should)
[4:51:54] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[4:51:56] <KnivesEve> minh huh
[4:51:58] <+jiggy_snipe> oh no
[4:52:04] <Terrarp> Woolie you should've expect your audience to be dumb
[4:52:06] <%Prevot> woolieMINHMAX
[4:52:12] <%ozzrabbit> Honestly, at the time I thought Woolie called them ‚ÄúBi-fus‚Äù because they were both male and female characters. I was wrong.
[4:52:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh no
[4:52:17] <heartlesshealer> NotLikeThis

[4:52:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> OOOOOOF
[4:52:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> lord
[4:52:24] <+jiggy_snipe> only $800, that's child's play Kappa
[4:52:31] <dizimous> I'm glad he backed down
[4:52:32] <+jiggy_snipe> but at least he stopped
[4:52:34] <+kewlmyc> I get it. I totally get it
[4:52:38] <nevan_44> doodNuts
[4:52:58] <%Lion_kun> pat's stream inspired a legit game article
[4:53:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> time goes fast when you're spending money
[4:53:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Ive played gacha F2P for 5 years I just dont feel the need to spend anything but the in game currency on Gacha
[4:53:10] <%Reverend_Roscoe> i lost 250 in 30 minutes and learned
[4:53:13] <dizimous> That's a special fear, discovering you've got a weakness
[4:53:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> I need to check that
[4:53:42] <%Rosewater_444> oooh
[4:53:43] <cipher758> no buyfu more laifu
[4:53:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie you absolutely have to finish Ultrakill at leats in your own time
[4:54:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> The end of the demo has something for you
[4:54:32] <heartlesshealer> woolie waited till ps4 for doom, he can do this
[4:54:32] <%Javaa01> Ultrakill does not end on a cocktease as of right now, it's a very definitive point of stopping
[4:54:33] <%Exiliator> I would trade the better audio quality in the anime to get the manga little camera in the corner anyday...
[4:54:41] <heartlesshealer> oh!
[4:54:49] <heartlesshealer> demo content
[4:54:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @BallerSwagBro9k it's very hard to be "I didn't get character but eh, I'll get em later maybe" but it does feel nice to be that
[4:54:57] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie has supreme patience
[4:54:58] <Terrarp> can we get the anime with manga screen?
[4:55:05] <+xerotwo> COLE PROTOCOL
[4:55:23] <%Exiliator> I have a hard time watching the anime, or watch edited content at all really nowadays
