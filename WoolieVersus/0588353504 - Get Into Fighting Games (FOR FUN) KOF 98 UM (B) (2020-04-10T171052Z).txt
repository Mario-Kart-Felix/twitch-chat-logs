[0:16:25] <+TomDanksEGOT> 5G is good if you are close and have a straight shot, it sucks if it has to go any distance or through walls or anything.
[0:16:40] <+rottingpastry> prime has white?
[0:16:45] <Froyuken> @jetjagger222 Huh. That he does.
[0:16:45] <@Menitta> I like how going from Terry matches in Smash to KOF feels so natural

[0:25:54] <Mysidian_Maestro> Need rollback for 02.
[0:25:54] <Froyuken> @GeltonZ Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance?
[0:25:54] <@Menitta> Everyone should buy the Code Mystics Garou port that added GGPO to the PS4 version like years later
[0:26:00] <Darkdrill> it just works
[0:26:01] <Mysidian_Maestro> This too.
[0:26:07] <%jetjagger222> ain't going on any multiplayer games without a wired connection
[0:26:08] <+ratearth> Everyone tell SNK to have code mystics put rollback netcode in all their retro games

[0:26:25] <fuji_92> Fps, maybe?
[0:26:26] <+rottingpastry> if you're a sports game fan, your life is hell
[0:26:27] <+Dumple_Roe> Like Garou has SIIIICK Rollback/Delay-based hybrid
[0:26:29] <+TomDanksEGOT> FPS players have this BS
[0:26:36] <GeltonZ> @Froyuken Battle Fantasia! ...seriously though, it taught EVERYONE how to do 2.5D fighters. SF4 was garbage in beta and then they saw a Battle Fantasia machine and said "Copy THAT!"
[0:26:37] <Klefth> If you're a serious sports game fan... What are you doing?
[0:26:39] <+rottingpastry> SOMETIMES you can still play the game
[0:26:39] <%jetjagger222> that was how it was 15 years ago
[0:26:48] <CasualAlohaFriday> RTS, too, I imagine
[0:26:49] <%jetjagger222> FPS also has peeker's advantage
[0:27:05] <+nekodelic> if you're a sports game player you deserve the bullshit you get
[0:27:09] <%jetjagger222> literal king crimson shit
[0:27:25] <+TossuDa> We need to bully them into it
[0:27:29] <artificiallynatural> Strive, League fighting game, whatever capcom makes next. at least we have something to look forward to
[0:27:29] <Klefth> No
[0:27:47] <+KingofFacade> that sounds hype

[0:30:15] <Froyuken> Why the Skullgirls hate?
[0:30:15] <@Menitta> Playing games you like with bad netcode vs games you dislike with good netcode
[0:30:18] <+steelmorrigan> but...Skullgirls is good?
[0:30:19] <+rottingpastry> I'm terrible at all fighting games, and I still own like 3 copies of skullgirls because lab zero deserves my money
[0:30:22] <GeltonZ> I have a Love/Hate relationship with Skullgirls due to ShinATproof jamming it down my throat too hard for YEARS before release.
[0:30:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> i wish dbfz or samsho had good netcode
[0:30:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, fuck
[0:30:31] <+steelmorrigan> I suck at it.

[0:30:34] <@Solidus_113> I love Skullgirls, but I don't like playing against competent players online, because they're too good with infinite's and resets and I suck

[0:31:41] <GeltonZ> I hate the lack of playable monster girls in the game. The cast is too normal for me.
