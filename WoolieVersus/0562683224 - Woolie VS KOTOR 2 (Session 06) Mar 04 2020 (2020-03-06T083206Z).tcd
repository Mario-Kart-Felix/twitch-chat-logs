[0:00:21] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus There's an alternative to Lightsabers called a Broadsaber. Basically it's a Lightsaber with its blade flattened into an actual blade which gives it better cutting add piercing power and it's better at deflecting blaster bolts

[0:05:58] <+glgzephyr> Has...has Woolie played any Silent Hill games?
[0:05:59] <+chiazam> I bought 10 chocolate bars for FF dlc, I feel so dumb
[0:06:02] <%Ashenik1> Silent Hill ??
[0:06:07] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Eldritch shit
[0:06:18] <+glgzephyr> because I feel like Silent Hill is exactly Woolie's type of shit
[0:06:19] <1matheuw> them eldritch shits
[0:06:20] <snakemuho> he played P.T. Kappa
[0:06:20] <theKingRamses> there's also horror like the mist
[0:06:21] <lotharrio> World of Horror isn't psychological at all. Like most Junji Ito, it's just weirdoes wandering around, making strange decisions and ruining everything.
[0:06:26] <RyuuAoi> I like the BLUD
[0:06:31] <shincadad> Cosmic Horror is the shit
[0:06:35] <+Nobrev> woolie likes body horror

[0:07:08] <+Premium_Heart> horrorful
[0:07:13] <$QueequegTheater> @Enemy_In_Disguise There's actually a good explanation for that
[0:07:18] <+BionoidLCR> @gruulmagebeast his name is Fann Y'pakk....what else is there to do...
[0:07:21] <@Squdnate> We need you to try out SIlent Hill at one point then. Know you did Shattered Memories, but man.. 1-4 are so GOOD
[0:07:23] <%Ashenik1> Woolie have you seenn Heredetary?
[0:07:33] <theKingRamses> what about when society is the horror, like witch trial type stuff
[0:07:40] <$QueequegTheater> I need to go see that Nic Cage Lovecraft movie
[0:07:48] <+glgzephyr> man Shattered Memories is trash and I will stand by that. Those chase sequences ruin the game
[0:07:52] <%JJCheeker> Why is there a hole drilled into this bathroom stall? Kappa
[0:08:01] <gruulmagebeast> Kappa
[0:08:05] <%tearfuldevil> Kappa
[0:08:06] <Jaku2011> Cults are lame, worst part of Silent Hill
[0:08:26] <%DatAsuna> Which mod?
[0:08:26] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:08:27] <+glgzephyr> probably back up your save files...
[0:08:38] <%DatAsuna> If it's just handmaiden hood down that's a simple drag and drop
[0:08:39] <1matheuw> someone should drown woolie with doom mods
[0:08:45] <@Squdnate> Spoiler Alert: Everything in Silent Hill was done by the cult (even 2)
[0:08:47] <+glgzephyr> it's a mod that puts Pockets in the game
[0:08:48] <gruulmagebeast> what does the restoration mod exactly do
[0:08:49] <%Ashenik1> Woolie you can do Silent Hill LP with Pat !!!
[0:08:49] <lotharrio> Does that auto reply if anyone says mod?
[0:08:50] <ChronoCanti> yeyeye
[0:08:56] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie, Nicholas Cage was in a recent adaptation of Lovecraft's "The Color Out of Space", and it has over 80% on Rotten Tomatos.
[0:08:59] <shincadad> Oh No we gotta do Peragus again!
[0:09:04] <$QueequegTheater> You should see it for the podcast
[0:09:06] <Jaku2011> Cult still sucks
[0:09:08] <+Nobrev> @datasuna I think he wanted to remove the handmaiden's hood
[0:09:08] <+TheDankDemon> not authentic DansGame
[0:09:13] <1matheuw> whoops restart the run
[0:09:18] <%DatAsuna> Yeah that's a super quick fix
[0:09:22] <+Freeborg1997> Are you going to talk to all the companions before you leave the Ebon Hawk?
[0:09:32] <%DatAsuna> back in the 480p days
[0:09:50] <Jaku2011> @zanco23 I think they did that last time
[0:09:53] <%JJCheeker> That's why I like Silent Hill 2 the best... No Cults
[0:09:54] <+glgzephyr> it is actually really fun
[0:10:01] <+glgzephyr> you feel like a gigantic nerd while doing it tho
[0:10:01] <lotharrio> Wouldn't that just be fencing?
[0:10:04] <$NoWayRyanTatum> Woolie I can get you a World of Horror code if you want one
[0:10:10] <Redblood801> Boooo
[0:10:14] <+TheDankDemon> you can stab stuff nice

[0:16:21] <+glgzephyr> oh we know you don't care. Most of us honestly don't care either. It's why people don't vote

[0:17:05] <bevyrage> as a head's up less than 20% of the US population even bothers to vote, and it lowers more each year. even the US doesn't care about its own politics as much as the media wants you to believe it does.
[0:17:06] <maxpasta> It’s just American politics is half domestic and half world politics
[0:17:07] <am_omega> The fuck did I come to?
[0:17:07] <%Ashenik1> Well tbh USA is the most powerfull empire of all time so it kinda matters who is in charge of Americans States ;d
[0:17:08] <Blazeofflame> When I was in China, all the other foreigners and my students had something to say about US politics

[0:19:26] <ThePimpGuin> not gonna lie, i like that off green veridian
[0:19:32] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Whatever form let’s me use a blaster in my off hand
[0:19:33] <+TheDankDemon> old man in pools
[0:19:35] <%DatAsuna> yes green and blue
[0:19:40] <andrei11dr> Woolie did say he would wach CW but... LUL
[0:19:43] <Redblood801> "Form 2 is useless, there are no more Sith" ~Some dumbass in the Jedi Order
[0:19:43] <maxpasta> He uses fencing because Christopher Lee was already trained in fencing @woolieversus
[0:19:48] <leonsnixon> Would have been cool to see young Dooku
[0:19:48] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Reminder that Mace Windu canonically had Palpatine dead to rights, and if Anakin had just waited for him to come back, he WOULD have made Anakin a Master
[0:19:52] <%Exiliator> Is Woolies mic a bit lower volume than V's for anyone else?
[0:19:54] <@Commando_Joe> Anakin-dotes?
[0:19:55] <am_omega> Yo the OG Clone Wars series was great.
[0:19:57] <ThePimpGuin> wish there was pink tho, the old clips for ep4 with Vader's saber looking pink honestly makes him look more dope
[0:19:58] <@Commando_Joe> rooSmug
[0:19:58] <%RioGascar> And then the cinematography didnt sell it at all
[0:20:00] <Joysta> Anak-dotes?
[0:20:04] <%TRILLTURBAN> A resounding meh
[0:20:05] <+Bluemanzee> Nah they bad
[0:20:07] <Tucker0603> fuck the sequels
[0:20:09] <mexicansunglasses> Nope
[0:20:10] <$QueequegTheater> THANK YOU
[0:20:10] <%tearfuldevil> they fine
[0:20:12] <@Commando_Joe> @Joysta octoGun
[0:20:12] <%JJCheeker> Christopher Lee was a bamf
[0:20:13] <available_line> they're ok
[0:20:14] <hntronium> Revenge of the Sith was good
[0:20:17] <$QueequegTheater> TLJ IS GOOD
[0:20:18] <dereks0n> Jango took Obi-Wan on 1v1 and won, never forget
[0:20:19] <hntronium> I hate the sequels
[0:20:20] <spyder_casual> i dunno man. sequels are pretty bad
[0:20:21] <theKingRamses> @Enemy_In_Disguise makashi is 1 handed i wanna say so you basically have a free offhand, dooku shoots lightning instead of using a blaster though
[0:20:22] <andrei11dr> I kinda like III
[0:20:23] <MidnightBurst12> space is forever broken
[0:20:24] <hntronium> TLJ is trash
[0:20:24] <%DatAsuna> It's just a texture, shouldn't harm your saves
[0:20:25] <leonsnixon> There are some moments
[0:20:30] <%tearfuldevil> Christopher Lee and Ewen McGregor were great
[0:20:33] <available_line> TLJ is diet KOTOR2
[0:20:34] <gruulmagebeast> sequs are hot garbage
[0:20:35] <Redblood801> @QueequegTheater Anakin should have taken a seat
[0:20:36] <%RioGascar> Practice safe modding
[0:20:36] <Riggs_The_Roadie> Christopher Lee was that baddest motherfucker of all time. He made a Metal album!
[0:20:36] <KeiPrime> on the rewatch leading up to Rise, i appreciated the prequels a bit more than usual but damn, its hard t o like them
[0:20:37] <%Irridium> their own seperate worlds
[0:20:38] <%DatAsuna> TLJ is just cribbing from the tale sof the jedi comics
[0:20:38] <%Eaglestrike117> To make it easy on both of you: Dooku is Form 2: Makashi Anakin is Form 5: Shien/Djem So Obiwan is Form 3: Soresu And all 3 have form 4: Ataryu shit mixed in
[0:20:39] <bahamut_garuda> blasphemy
[0:20:41] <andrei11dr> But I and II are trash
[0:20:45] <$QueequegTheater> Ewoks are worse than Canto Bight
[0:20:45] <+sherndon226> The Last Jedi is good Rise of Skywalker is trash
[0:20:47] <notenoughgirls> i love how unapologetically awful tros is
[0:20:51] <am_omega> The sequel series has tons of issues that could totally be fixed.
[0:20:52] <QuantumButler> THE DEAD SPEAK!
[0:20:53] <%derap41> !uptime
[0:20:53] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 31 minutes and 56 seconds
[0:20:53] <JetpackMcQuack> Yup
[0:20:54] <%FallenAngelZelos> Oh no, we're talking about the Last Jedi
[0:20:57] <Tucker0603> fuck the sequels because the remove the EU
[0:21:04] <KeiPrime> last jedi and rise are both garb
[0:21:07] <%DatAsuna> Juyo FTW
[0:21:08] <hntronium> Rise of Skywalker was better than TLJ, I had more fun in it
[0:21:08] <@Commando_Joe> it's like watcing the first seasons of Game of Thrones @WoolieVersus octoSad
[0:21:08] <%RioGascar> the last jedi has probably the best cinematography in star wars
[0:21:09] <%JJCheeker> I respectfully disagree I hate them. But to each their own
[0:21:13] <+kewlmyc> Last Jedi has good ideas. It's more I can say about Rise of Skywalker
[0:21:16] <%DatAsuna> The ferocity form
[0:21:16] <%fingalights> Its like trying to watch Lost again
[0:21:19] <%RioGascar> like SOME SHOTS IN LAST JEDI ARE BEAUTIFUL
[0:21:20] <%JJCheeker> Like what you like it's all good to me
[0:21:21] <SleepyHero34> Cheer700 Have you ever played Dragon Age: Origins? If not would you consider streaming it?
[0:21:24] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus So we need an End of Rey movie
[0:21:25] <%tearfuldevil> @Tucker0603 the EU post canon was nooooot that good
[0:21:27] <Sauceboss15> At least the prequels stuck the landing
[0:21:28] <andrei11dr> Ita like BSG LUL
[0:21:30] <+sherndon226> "Somehow, Palpatine has returned"
[0:21:31] <maxpasta> JJ made TLJ not go anywhere by not even trying to use it
[0:21:31] <leonsnixon> Woolie is just vibing
[0:21:32] <spyder_casual> rogue one was good
[0:21:33] <%tearfuldevil> in fact it was mostly bad
[0:21:40] <notenoughgirls> last jedi at least had actual ideas going into it
[0:21:41] <Redblood801> More power to you
[0:21:42] <gruulmagebeast> queequeg with the facts
[0:21:45] <%DatAsuna> Hate em, but oh well.
[0:21:46] <+ShikiHisashi> I like how things are going now in Star Wars. I prefer the sequels over the pre
[0:21:50] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> I like the last Eva episodes, fight me
[0:21:53] <Jaku2011> Last Jedi bad
[0:21:57] <KeiPrime> congratulations
[0:21:59] <Redblood801> They're so memeable
[0:21:59] <%DatAsuna> I ain't gonna be "they never happened" like some people bout the prequels
[0:22:00] <Tucker0603> @tearknack the books are good
[0:22:02] <%Irridium> liked force awakens, loved last jedi
[0:22:05] <theKingRamses> duel of the fates though
[0:22:06] <am_omega> Well Ryan Johnson kinda got all these toys that he decided to break for some reason.
[0:22:07] <Blazeofflame> Last Jedi felt flaccid and Rise of Skywalker was like someone was trying to force feed me a boner pill
[0:22:10] <+TheDankDemon> CGI is the only cool part of nu sw
[0:22:10] <%derap41> Phantom menace isn't that fun its a very slow watch
[0:22:10] <+KawaiiJetty> these post tidbits of star wars reminds me of jk rowling goddamn it lol
[0:22:21] <%FallenAngelZelos> Let's all just agree that KOTOR is baller AF
[0:22:22] <am_omega> Like the lie "Empire was hated when it came out"
[0:22:26] <$QueequegTheater> The prequels are a good story told badly, the sequels are one good story and two bad ones
[0:22:30] <%tearfuldevil> @Tucker0603 a small portion of the dozens of books are good.
[0:22:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19

[0:22:32] <leonsnixon> Are we installing mods?
[0:22:37] <gruulmagebeast> its not star wars without an argument
[0:22:47] <andrei11dr> To be fair ,Returns of The Jedi is campy as fuck LUL
[0:22:48] <%RioGascar> the one thing the sequels did give us is fantastic cinematography and visuals. Rogue one even had some GREAT SHOTS
[0:22:49] <+glgzephyr> so much hair
[0:22:54] <jeffishype> Ya'll say whatever you want about the prequeals but the Darth Maul fight was the hypest shit -ever-.
[0:22:59] <Redblood801> I feel like my enjoyment of the prequels was enhanced because of memes and The Clone Wars
[0:22:59] <$QueequegTheater> Oh my god this man's glorious hair
[0:23:00] <%Superspider51> @WoolieVersus the mod breaks one of the lightsaber colors
[0:23:03] <%Irridium> the prequels at least had a general story running through all the movies
[0:23:06] <%TRILLTURBAN> BOOOOOOO
[0:23:06] <+sherndon226> lets be honest the movies are the worst part of star wars
[0:23:06] <+caffienatedjedi> No, we need those

[0:29:26] <$QueequegTheater> At the point in time when bullets can pass through the interdimensional walls, when firepower takes up the entirety and eternity of space and time, all being stuck in a neverending life and death cycle as bullets recover and destroy their bodies in quick succession, while nobody can think of anything but the sheer force of the bullets flying literally everywhere in the Materium, turning the Warp itself into nothing but a sea of semi-automatic weaponry then there will be enough dakka. Or almost.

[0:40:26] <%JJCheeker> They sure tried
[0:40:31] <%NightWithNine> Logically speaking, Carth does meet all the criteria of being a simp. Given his proximity to a Sith Lord, does that make him... a Simp Lord?
[0:40:36] <JetpackMcQuack> It's like bullying a Furby
[0:40:48] <funkerbuster> Vanilla as a genre was a mistake
[0:40:50] <%gatorafan> MrDestructoid now listen....
[0:40:53] <StrangeCoincidence> is that woolie's gf?
[0:40:57] <StrangeCoincidence> WHOA

[0:41:21] <StrangeCoincidence> didn't see the beard
[0:41:23] <+glgzephyr> holy fuck
[0:41:26] <%JJCheeker> You should romance T 3
[0:41:29] <lotharrio> "Timmy needs the man with the best sexual technique in the galaxy to save him from the well?"
[0:41:32] <%RioGascar> You need a protagonist?
[0:41:32] <MidnightBurst12> EDGE
[0:41:33] <funkerbuster> no it’s the guy woolie shot
[0:41:35] <SoaringLettuce> beep away, motherfucker
[0:41:35] <$QueequegTheater> BE NICE TO HIM
[0:41:36] <+glgzephyr> dark side dialogue for T3 feels real bad...
[0:41:37] <siamzero94> No man go hardcore
[0:41:39] <leonsnixon> LUL
[0:41:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lotharrio FBI OPEN UP
[0:41:51] <$QueequegTheater> @glgzephyr It's not even DS, it's just cunty
[0:41:52] <%JJCheeker> T 3 best waifu
[0:41:58] <Blazeofflame> Just like, staple an Ashoka Tano fleshlight to T3 and romance 'em
[0:42:04] <snakemuho> @glgzephyr dude, I sold him on Nar Shaddaa because I'm playing fulll evil, and I felt like shit
[0:42:05] <leonsnixon> you will suffer for your crimes
[0:42:05] <%NightWithNine> Have you ever just waterboarded your roomba for information
[0:42:07] <+glgzephyr> @QueequegTheater yeah but you totally get DS points for that
[0:42:07] <lotharrio> @doc_ock_rokc Hey, blame that dog.
[0:42:09] <Redblood801> How many swear words is T3 saying right now?
[0:42:19] <Halospaz117> All of them
[0:42:19] <reven229> Apparently, T3 didn't want to PAY HER
[0:42:24] <%gatorafan> MrDestructoid did you see him? I needed to delete
[0:42:25] <funkerbuster> one word Kappa
[0:42:25] <$QueequegTheater> @glgzephyr Not worth it, Darth T3 is much more satisfying
[0:42:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> He deleted some hot alien oviposition vids
[0:42:30] <+Freeborg1997> @Blazeofflame O_o
[0:42:40] <%NightWithNine> Can you actually make T3 evil?
[0:42:44] <%JJCheeker> T 3 do you mind if I insert my data stick
[0:42:45] <%Irridium> maybe the explanation was in the memory core you accidentally deleted LUL
[0:42:47] <+glgzephyr> @QueequegTheater I mean Woolie COULD get Darth T3 by making T3 hate him, right?
[0:42:56] <siamzero94> He's playing you for a fool, Woolie. Don't trust him!
[0:42:57] <AMaidIndeed> Oops all horse porn
[0:43:00] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus I love SWTOR's version of astromech speak. it looks like code/math speak.
[0:43:01] <leonsnixon> He had horse porn in his save files
[0:43:01] <snakemuho> @NightWithNine yeah, you can even make HK good
[0:43:05] <$QueequegTheater> I don't think so, you have to influence him down the DS
[0:43:12] <SoaringLettuce> can a roomba learn hatred?
[0:43:14] <%gatorafan> Don't worry master, we can make wonderful new memories together MrDestructoid
[0:43:19] <$QueequegTheater> @SnaKemuho No, that's a glitch
[0:43:19] <%NightWithNine> I knew about HK flipping sides, but T3? Would've never guessed
[0:43:23] <am_omega> Just like all the nHentai tags Kappa
[0:43:27] <$QueequegTheater> That screenshot is fake

[0:51:25] <%SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:51:27] <funkerbuster> where’s the rule34?
[0:51:27] <+NarcissistCactus> nevermind
[0:51:28] <hntronium> FELL INTO? YOU WERE ALREADY FULLY INTO jesus
[0:51:31] <%derap41> So that murder boner
[0:51:31] <Jaku2011> Command grabbed
[0:51:34] <maxpasta> Force consecutive regular punches
[0:51:35] <+wintrysoma> so she says all this but obviously your character can't see the cutscene
[0:51:35] <%NightWithNine> I N S U F F I C I E N T
[0:51:35] <+kyh9> Your mom is a Sith Lord
[0:51:36] <+Fortunato5678> A Sith exile leading a Jedi exile
[0:51:36] <%SouLucha> "For the Force"
[0:51:37] <%JJCheeker> Damn he chokeslam
[0:51:41] <+eanscrale> Wow I tuned in at a good time
[0:51:49] <%derap41> Totally not out for Vengeance
[0:51:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> That old battle axe has seen WAR
[0:51:51] <$QueequegTheater> No, those were clearly Jedi
[0:52:09] <indig0bird> Holy shit, that's foreshadowing
[0:52:09] <%OldManJEWc> Rule of 2?
[0:52:11] <megamirk> Kreia: "Then he totally combo'd me on wakeup, it was fucking sick"
[0:52:11] <andrei11dr> Wats her race called again?
[0:52:19] <Redblood801> Human
[0:52:19] <leonsnixon> Rule of two maintained
[0:52:21] <RushUnplugged> those typical red sabers of the jedi with no particular inclination
[0:52:29] <%NightWithNine> I thought Kreia was just a dusty ass human
[0:52:30] <funkerbuster> the people Kappa
[0:52:33] <am_omega> "I blocked when he did his command grab in the corner"
[0:52:34] <%tearfuldevil> @andrei11dr she's human
[0:52:35] <JetpackMcQuack> They were "good eventually" Jedi
[0:52:35] <Tucker0603> THAT SOUNDS SUSS!!!
[0:52:36] <+glgzephyr> @QueequegTheater LUL
[0:52:37] <MidnightBurst12> rule of two ain't a thing yet
[0:52:41] <%MrMoonGoose> Just a human
[0:52:47] <%tearfuldevil> @NightWithNine she is just human
[0:52:47] <Lefteron> Influence gained:Krai Influencelost:Krai
[0:52:49] <$QueequegTheater> @OldManJEWc This vastly predates Rule of 2
[0:52:51] <%NightWithNine> Caucasian?
[0:53:01] <hntronium> I WANNA BE THE VERY BEST
[0:53:04] <funkerbuster> Backstabbing buffet
[0:53:04] <%tearfuldevil> her wierd eyes are just a wierd space magic thing
[0:53:07] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OneGorillionDollars
[0:53:08] <%OldManJEWc> I see._.
[0:53:14] <lotharrio> Well, at least my killer will get what's coming to him.
[0:53:18] <$QueequegTheater> Darth Ketchum
[0:53:22] <andrei11dr> Oh ,i thought she was that Asoca race all this time LUL
[0:53:23] <moddinggoat> depends...are they the truth sith
[0:53:36] <%NightWithNine> I mean aren't Sith Eyes a thing
[0:53:38] <%derap41> Red lasers Woolie
[0:53:41] <%MrMoonGoose> They are not true sith
[0:53:43] <+OneGorillionDollars> They still turn on themselves after the rule of two LUL
[0:53:48] <%NightWithNine> that might be why she's got a weird look to her
[0:53:48] <indig0bird> And INDIGNITIES
[0:53:49] <Fuji808> DAMMIT
[0:53:52] <muniea3> but that would just make baby palpatene more powerful tho
[0:53:53] <+glgzephyr> HUNGER
[0:53:59] <%tearfuldevil> @NightWithNine yeah but KReia's are different than every single other version i've seen
[0:54:04] <leonsnixon> Dark Jedi?
[0:54:05] <Fuji808> I missed the revelation to her backstory?
[0:54:05] <%NightWithNine> Fair point!
[0:54:06] <moddinggoat> the rule of two is one who has power and one who desires it, betrayl is needed fro sith
[0:54:06] <Retinolgaming> INDIGNITIES THO 👀
[0:54:07] <%JJCheeker> OK I'm idiot that was never in a trailer
[0:54:11] <moddinggoat> there must always be a betrayer
[0:54:16] <%krispen_wa> WHY YOU BLIND
[0:54:19] <indig0bird> Lies!
[0:54:26] <+glgzephyr> Nothing wrong with my sight, tho I can't see
[0:54:30] <siamzero94> "Blind"
[0:54:31] <Psyramics> Her earlier: I am not blind!
[0:54:32] <Halospaz117> "My eyes were holding me back!"
[0:54:34] <+Freeborg1997> Do they actually say the name of crusty boy and mask boy in the game itself?
[0:54:35] <%NightWithNine> She's a mole person!
[0:54:38] <+Ancopro> i can see, im just blind
[0:54:40] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> have they gone into first person view while controlling her?
[0:54:40] <JetpackMcQuack> Force vision cyr5Head
[0:54:41] <+NarcissistCactus> I'm not blind I'm just on hard mode
[0:54:41] <%jinking79> didn't see your hand getting cut off
[0:54:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> SWITCH TO HER AND GO FIRST PERSON
[0:54:43] <%TRILLTURBAN> My eyes were like training weights
[0:54:44] <zenith0111> SHE DELETED HER OWN EYES
[0:54:50] <$QueequegTheater> Bitch needs some contacts
[0:54:52] <moddinggoat> i miss you crazy old lady
[0:54:55] <Redblood801> She got the Glaucoma
[0:54:55] <snakemuho> She turned into Demon Hunter
[0:54:57] <%tearfuldevil> @MegalomaniacalMegalodon i don'y think woolie has used first person mode at all
[0:54:59] <moddinggoat> well never get another one like krieea will we
[0:55:01] <JetpackMcQuack> Eyes are too weak
[0:55:03] <maxpasta> Yes switch to her and go first person
[0:55:03] <prince_johnny_> Holy shit
[0:55:04] <am_omega> "I am not blind, grab my walking cane I need to figure out where I am going"
[0:55:04] <Tucker0603> she's like that race from SWTOR

[0:55:30] <Sarl109> that speech from Kreya felt super real to me lol, I'm very near-sighted
[0:55:32] <muniea3> a cool concept that happens to be in............
[0:55:32] <+glgzephyr> god she relies SO heavily on the Force LUL

[0:55:53] <leonsnixon> Hmmmm
[0:55:54] <funkerbuster> we fuckin
[0:55:54] <+Ancopro> she barely likes you
[0:55:54] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> But can Kreia see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
[0:55:56] <%FallenAngelZelos> The clap back is hard
[0:55:57] <andrei11dr> Of forgot this game had that
[0:55:59] <moddinggoat> @glgzephyr perhaps shes just a hyrptical old women..or perhap she uses the force like one uses poisonn
[0:56:01] <+glgzephyr> NEED MORE INFLUENCE
[0:56:02] <indig0bird> She doesn't like anyone... on the team
[0:56:02] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Just stroke her ego
[0:56:05] <snakemuho> Tsundere Granny
[0:56:06] <Tucker0603> @tearknack if that's where they're from then probably
[0:56:07] <Timurine> GREATER GOOD
[0:56:09] <lotharrio> Negative influence works just as well, most of the time.
[0:56:10] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Great character
[0:56:13] <zenith0111> Is she our mommy ? :o
[0:56:15] <+glgzephyr> @moddinggoat Alright you, calm down

[0:56:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Gossip[ simulation
[0:56:25] <moddinggoat> she is someones mom though
[0:56:27] <$QueequegTheater> Maybe in the river
[0:56:28] <%TRILLTURBAN> My favorite game mechanic, gossiping
[0:56:33] <megamirk> the Kreia abides

[0:57:00] <+sherndon226> Terrace House: Ebon Hawk edition
[0:57:05] <$QueequegTheater> @moddinggoat The writer has explicitly stated that she isn't
[0:57:07] <+glgzephyr> is V the best LP partner Woolie has had, at least outside of SBFP?
[0:57:08] <manwithaxe> hawkhouse
[0:57:09] <%tearfuldevil> @Tucker0603 there are probably similarities between how she sees and how the Miraluka see, but you and woolie will learn more later in the game
[0:57:19] <moddinggoat> @QueequegTheater avellone? didnt he shrug
[0:57:21] <+captainpodock> Ebon Sqwack
[0:57:38] <$QueequegTheater> @moddinggoat No, he de-confirmed that theory
[0:57:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:57:50] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh Little V is around my age then too
[0:57:50] <moddinggoat> he complimeneted it though rihgt?
[0:57:50] <Tucker0603> @tearknack mkay then
[0:57:55] <%tearfuldevil> they jsut look alike because reasons
[0:57:56] <%NightWithNine> I really do like V around for this playthrough, but I gotta say SuperEyepatchWolf on the Goemon playthrough was gold
[0:58:03] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I was like 12, similar mindblowing moments
[0:58:07] <Retinolgaming> Hidden SBFP Lore LUL
[0:58:13] <SoaringLettuce> its just pragmatic

[1:00:04] <%tearfuldevil> god in retrospect whatshe's implying is

[1:00:06] <Prevot> are all tsunderes dark side?
[1:00:06] <+captain_history> the path of TSUNDERE

[1:01:36] <%tearfuldevil> tsudnere is just emotional and physical absue, yandere is murder and kidnapping, so, the latter i guess?

[1:01:42] <leonsnixon> Comp
[1:01:44] <snakemuho> Ok, tricky question, can you get Handmaiden's prestige with negative influence without triggering her Visas/Kreia convo? I'm doing DS run with - influence on everyone, and not sure if I fucked up with Handmaiden by dropping her inf low since I remembered that her sparrings raise inf too late, and I'm locked into late Nar Shaddaa
[1:01:46] <Tucker0603> I need this mix

[1:07:07] <andrei11dr> I lost 4
[1:07:09] <judgefudge9> Another one
[1:07:12] <Aydarkzero> get a ps3!
[1:07:13] <Zebroneath> @KaitoJinn Thank you!
[1:07:15] <+Bluemanzee> Mine red ringed right after a friend asked me if my xbox ever red ringed
[1:07:18] <KaitoJinn> kaitojRage
[1:07:18] <%gatorafan> I remember when the guys gave Max that haunted Xbox
[1:07:23] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @glgzephyr
[1:07:25] <+Ixek> I've heard those horror stories, but my first 360 never broke down on me. Reliable thing.
[1:07:28] <zenith0111> To think 360 was the height of Microsoft LUL
[1:07:28] <manwithaxe> jesus, my 360 ran for like 10 years and still works
[1:07:29] <judgefudge9> I had the elite so I never red ringed
[1:07:30] <am_omega> I lost 1 and that 1 became a fight stick.
[1:07:30] <andrei11dr> And then i just got a ps3
[1:07:31] <zenith0111> WOOF
[1:07:32] <Jaku2011> I bought 3 360s
[1:07:33] <Tucker0603> I've fixed a red ring twice, never had to buy a new one
[1:07:33] <leonsnixon> How many do you need?
[1:07:36] <%Irridium> had 2 red rings and the E74 error. Fun times.
[1:07:40] <+glgzephyr> damn this thing costs 300 bucks
[1:07:42] <arran_throttle> Whoolie, Plague is gonna be in a comic as gnome, porn director
[1:07:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> I had one day one it lasted 6 years then RRed and I got it referbished
[1:07:53] <lotharrio> Playstation systems have their own failures, but never anything as bad as the red ring.
[1:07:58] <Jkhmn12> oh shit I just got back from the store
[1:08:01] <am_omega> Now what sucks is my PS3 got the Yellow light.
[1:08:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> "Referbished" they just sent a new one
[1:08:09] <419575> frank zappa
[1:08:16] <am_omega> Yellow Light was pretty bad.
[1:08:21] <Jaku2011> But xbone has lasted the whole generation so that's nice
[1:08:31] <Aydarkzero> @am_omega i was so mad the first time that happened =/
[1:08:35] <andrei11dr> At least it didn't burn the house down like the Dreamcast

[1:10:25] <MidnightBurst12> ayy
[1:10:26] <%JJCheeker> It's a cult ish mindset
[1:10:27] <available_line> I love how Kreia is just... straight up admitting everything.
[1:10:33] <judgefudge9> Pockets: what is they bidding master. Kiera: PAY ME!!!!!
[1:10:36] <+wintrysoma> read another book
[1:10:37] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Kreia went on Joe Rogan's podcast and the Jedi cancelled her
[1:10:47] <andrei11dr> z
[1:10:49] <theKingRamses> that book USED to be in that section
[1:10:55] <Zohare> Woolie had a 1/10 chance to get that guess right
[1:10:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> @MARTIANxMADNESS OOF
[1:11:01] <%gatorafan> Kreia played Doom and realized church was dumb
[1:11:02] <Halospaz117> "Is there a way to learn how to fill my pockets?" "Not from a jedi"
[1:11:07] <judgefudge9> Why would the Jedi keep that shit around
[1:11:18] <Puhff> Except Slytherin is explicitly evil, even in the world Kappa
[1:11:20] <zenith0111> Snipe Snitches calebKek
[1:11:27] <+Greezey> finally here live, after watching the vods nonstop I'm caught up
[1:11:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Greezey you missed the cool intresting bit
[1:11:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:49] <manwithaxe> is that swction where force lightning is hidden
[1:11:51] <reven229> Kreia: SO Pockets, I know you're a jedi, but what if they paid you?
[1:11:55] <lotharrio> Because you don't know what you're messing with.
[1:12:04] <SoaringLettuce> they keepikg you docile, MAN
[1:12:09] <+Fortunato5678> Except with Jedi it's almost always true, they cannot handle that shit
[1:12:14] <+slunkymcgee> Muh tragedy of Darth Plaguis the wise
[1:12:16] <manwithaxe> its not a story the jedi would tell ya
[1:12:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> What form of power is this??
[1:12:19] <judgefudge9> The tale of Darth Plagus the wise
[1:12:20] <+captain_history> NOT... from a Jedi.
[1:12:21] <%derap41> intent
[1:12:25] <Fuji808> Conviction?
[1:12:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> INTENT
[1:12:26] <AMaidIndeed> intent
[1:12:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @lefteron
[1:12:29] <+Greezey> @doc_ock_rokc aw dammit. how long have they been goin today
[1:12:32] <+glgzephyr> and he came
[1:12:43] <am_omega> Oh its fine Anakin just needed Force Healing but everyone was so stupid that they did not just tell him.
[1:12:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Greezey hour and 20 min or so
[1:12:51] <manwithaxe> jedi cant shoot lightning
[1:12:51] <Jaku2011> Jedi not teaching healing techniques that save lives
[1:12:57] <+Greezey> aaaah more vods
[1:13:02] <manwithaxe> not unless your mace windu
[1:13:04] <judgefudge9> Use the Woo Woo
[1:13:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> Fucking RoS fucking up lore
[1:13:16] <andrei11dr> Just like scientology LUL
[1:13:16] <zenith0111> Because somehow lightning comes from negative emotions BrokeBack
[1:13:20] <+glgzephyr> man the kreia conversation ALONE will take an hour
[1:13:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> But healing requires compassion and empathy, which are bad
[1:13:25] <+glgzephyr> Ebon Hawk stream?
[1:13:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Instantly corrupted
[1:13:34] <am_omega> Healing, the Jedi ability is not taught to other jedi.
[1:13:37] <+captain_history> Wasn't the whole idea that Padme dying was basically just a self-fulfilled prophecy when Anakin did the thing? She died because of that.
[1:13:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> @glgzephyr oh most DEFINATELY
[1:13:39] <%gatorafan> I read a book, I'm evil now :)
[1:13:40] <zenith0111> Yet mind control is completely neutral BrokeBack
[1:13:47] <Jaku2011> Lightning big bad hand that red lightsaber over
[1:13:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> The kids are down with the devil!
[1:13:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> @glgzephyr wait for the Test of Strenght
[1:13:58] <Redblood801> You played them devil games Woolie
[1:13:59] <%netrac> And a lot of them don't have id
[1:14:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> How many of the ones that don't come back become meth addicts?
[1:14:08] <Sarl109> Woolie is a Sith, confirmed
[1:14:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> So being stuffy about Jedi teaching...Woolie, DID YOU COME BACK?
[1:14:14] <lotharrio> No, Woolie! You don't know what you're messing with!
[1:14:17] <judgefudge9> You playin devil games darlington????
[1:14:19] <zenith0111> FEAR MONGERING
[1:14:25] <bleugh> the jedi are space amish...
[1:14:25] <theKingRamses> @captain_history yeah she basically died of a broken heart because of the things he had done trying to save her
[1:14:30] <Addyoxt> hey anyone know what happened to pat's twitch channel?
[1:14:31] <leonsnixon> The devils playground?
[1:14:39] <Sarl109> Woolie saw the flaws on the teachings
[1:14:47] <Sarl109> he has fallen to the darkness
[1:14:49] <Fuji808> Kreia is literally the most interesting character in Star Wars fight me
[1:14:50] <+Fortunato5678> @Addyoxt What do you mean?
[1:14:52] <%Ashenik1> Thats how alt right works on internet !!
[1:14:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @addyoxt Renamed to PatStaresAt

[1:14:59] <am_omega> "Hey man the devil is pretty cool, nah bro just ignore the sacrificial murders"
[1:15:03] <Halospaz117> "SHIT, SAID TOO MUCH"
[1:15:05] <heartlesshealer> ??? You mean pat's recent rebranding to Patstaresat or what? @Addyoxt
[1:15:05] <manwithaxe> you did what to hitler?
[1:15:07] <%krispen_wa> i don't want to talk about it - Kreiarth
[1:15:17] <lotharrio> All the best bands are associate with Satan.
[1:15:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> I like how the Jedi believes once a person knows to much they automatically fall to the dark side
[1:15:34] <Addyoxt> yea found it...didnt know it was renamed thanks guys
[1:15:40] <%krispen_wa> get fukt
[1:15:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @leonsnixon Amish and mennonites are given a few years, usually around 18, in which they are aloud to party and get all the repressed shit out, then choose if they want to come back to the community
[1:15:59] <heartlesshealer> @Addyoxt If you mean his schedule for today, he's supposed to be doing Dark Souls on PeachSaliva's channel later today. Paige's life permitting

[1:17:00] <%Ashenik1> Chris Avelone you ma man
[1:17:01] <Hillthugsta> Has Woolie witnessed Kreia gettin her ass kicked?
[1:17:04] <%DatAsuna> which means there's some dark side convos no matter what
[1:17:05] <snakemuho> they wrote everything in 2 days and had to make assets for another 14 months
[1:17:06] <%gatorafan> I N F L U E N C E R

[1:17:32] <Retinolgaming> His youtube prowess is unmatched.
[1:17:35] <indig0bird> Ugh, I hate this reton
[1:17:38] <+LimpBisquicks> Think I was 9 first time I played this on Xbox, and was too stupid to figure out how to pass influence checks, so I never got any of this lore dump til endgame, or not at all. so it just seems like a sequence break seeing all of this in the beginning of the game
[1:17:38] <%krispen_wa> But she did tho...
[1:17:50] <zenith0111> Sith..... IS AN EVIL RELIGION
[1:17:50] <%DatAsuna> @krispen_wa not on korriban
[1:17:55] <heartlesshealer> Pockets the cult leader?

[1:17:57] <+glgzephyr> star forge breh
[1:17:58] <indig0bird> It's a retcon that makes everything worse
[1:17:59] <%gatorafan> with DEBT
[1:18:04] <%DatAsuna> It's not retcon
[1:18:06] <andrei11dr> She did it with those POCKETS
[1:18:14] <theKingRamses> before kotor
[1:18:18] <%SouLucha> This is such an interesting plot point.
[1:18:21] <%DatAsuna> It's literally saying there was no empire on korriban
[1:18:30] <%netrac> Good benefits and insurance
[1:18:32] <Prevot> money corrupts everyone
[1:18:44] <%DatAsuna> And that the korriban we saw was malak's imittion of the sith
[1:18:49] <theKingRamses> how did she metal slug the galaxy
[1:18:51] <megamirk> Malachor V might've had something to do with it
[1:18:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19

[1:18:57] <%krispen_wa> free stickers if they joined the sith
[1:19:00] <zenith0111> DEEP POCKETS
[1:19:01] <%DatAsuna> @pan_nochal yes
[1:19:02] <siamzero94> They were all in her POCKETS!
[1:19:11] <lotharrio> Revan just slinging those credits everywhere, buying loyalty.
[1:19:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Here's something Woolie doesn't grasp: ALL Jedi are Grey, because violence and effecting the universe (major tenants of the Jedi lifestyle) are inherently Dark, in Star Wars. ALL Jedi have to balance Dark and Light, and each is individual.
[1:19:15] <Our_oBoros> Free dental.
[1:19:22] <zenith0111> CARGO SWEATER
[1:19:25] <%gatorafan> just a few sets of Pazaak gone awry

[1:23:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Bao Dur <#
[1:23:40] <leonsnixon> LUL
[1:23:44] <dereks0n> The Iridonian
[1:23:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> <3
[1:23:49] <heartlesshealer> The Iridonian is familiar with you, friend of the Iridonian
[1:23:59] <+glgzephyr> Really Maul is from Dathomir!?
[1:23:59] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus Krai is the only one that can hear you shit-talk her
[1:24:11] <%DatAsuna> Nope
[1:24:15] <lotharrio> Iridonian Quadroon.
[1:24:15] <Lefteron> Yeah
[1:24:17] <%DatAsuna> That's only in the other timeline
[1:24:19] <+sherndon226> Kal got himself a Dathomir girlfriend
[1:24:19] <indig0bird> "I'm not mad, you're mad *tears*"
[1:24:21] <muniea3> all for nuthin
[1:24:22] <Tucker0603> once again, fuck Disney
[1:24:29] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @glgzephyr yep, disney
[1:24:31] <+Ixek> Disney Star Wars Lore is irrelevant anyways.
[1:24:33] <powerprotoman> theres a lot of cool stuff at that bridge thats on fire
[1:24:36] <bigbradish> Why does she sound horny?
[1:24:37] <%DatAsuna> @glgzephyr ony in clone wars/disney canon
[1:24:39] <+glgzephyr> I'm down for that addition
[1:24:43] <%tearfuldevil> the dathomir stuff is disney canon
[1:24:45] <Prevot> she looks like she'd be trying to get into your bed but then turns out she only wants Demolition Man style mind-sex
[1:24:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Power Architects
[1:24:52] <lotharrio> @bigbradish Cause she is.
[1:24:53] <megamirk> the Iridonian also has a calm, soothing voice
[1:24:54] <siamzero94> Forget Disney, it's unimportant in Kotor 2 anyways
[1:24:56] <+SarcFa> Clone Wars is in the nebulous place of both old EU and disney Canon
[1:24:58] <+glgzephyr> I'm glad Dathomir got stuff in Disney canon. It deserves it
[1:25:03] <%TRILLTURBAN> Stance up
[1:25:05] <maxpasta> None of that was deleted because of Disney
[1:25:06] <heartlesshealer> She is fully in awe, dang
[1:25:17] <+SarcFa> so sadly the zabrak split from clone wars is technically canon for this
[1:25:18] <lotharrio> She's all about style switching.
[1:25:18] <Lefteron> Know what happens later that line is a bit too litteral
[1:25:18] <+Freeborg1997> @bigbradish She's spent her entire life in a sterile room with a bunch of women.
[1:25:23] <lotharrio> Swordtrickswordtrick
[1:25:24] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus the most actual punchgirl

[1:26:11] <+glgzephyr> bitch that is some severe PTSD you're steppin on
[1:26:30] <lotharrio> No psychologists in Star Wars.
[1:26:47] <%TRILLTURBAN> Star Wars, the therapy saga
[1:26:49] <+Freeborg1997> @lotharrio Not enough credits in that profession
[1:26:55] <+glgzephyr> @lotharrio there's only so much that therapy can do for post-war PTSD
[1:27:04] <gade177> She wants the d.
[1:27:10] <muniea3> she might technically be reset after you get her
[1:27:13] <%gatorafan> we had a DAILY shittalk session
[1:27:15] <DocMadfox> That's an angry hoe
[1:27:15] <+Freeborg1997> Think you already did this
[1:27:17] <%TRILLTURBAN> She also said you were slinging hella meat in them robes
[1:27:18] <lotharrio> @glgzephyr Yeah but space magic though
[1:27:25] <megamirk> I may be a pimp, but dark side? Naaah
[1:27:25] <DSD24> Such a lust for revenge
[1:27:28] <Tucker0603> "she had a dildo made in your image"
[1:27:34] <Lefteron> She never used it on lonenly nights she told me herself
[1:27:58] <+glgzephyr> fuck it just give those vets some glitterstim
[1:28:02] <+glgzephyr> sort em right out
[1:28:03] <Infeirno23> murder is the truest form of love
[1:28:07] <%krispen_wa> did she forget the face of her father though
[1:28:08] <heartlesshealer> truth may lie in the heart of battle
[1:28:46] <lotharrio> Atris believes in negging.
[1:28:48] <Lefteron> She is the bottom
[1:29:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[1:29:16] <redrins> so what she's saying is that she wants to make more Kappa
[1:29:17] <+kyh9> Distracted by my dick?
[1:29:22] <Infeirno23> Dun dun dun dun
[1:29:33] <Korgororo> horny huh Kappa
[1:29:42] <+glgzephyr> IT SURE WOULD BEE TRAGIC
[1:29:44] <CruxAustralis> that is a convoluted way to talk about masturbation
[1:29:45] <lotharrio> Atris is pretty clear that SHE is the last Jedi and no one else counts, though.
[1:30:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:30:14] <+glgzephyr> so sad
[1:30:19] <Redblood801> What a nightmare
[1:30:20] <%gatorafan> FeelsBadMan
[1:30:28] <siamzero94> Ah fuck now I'm on board
[1:30:30] <+glgzephyr> I don't want to think about that world
[1:30:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Now imagine an enemy that could disable one of your styles temporarily
[1:30:48] <DSD24> Having a good idle stance is important
[1:30:50] <Infeirno23> Kicking ass is an art form to her
[1:30:50] <andrei11dr> out of the 4 to lose ,ill take that one LUL
[1:30:54] <rubbishbinge> Gun, trick, sword... eh pizza?
[1:30:57] <Lefteron> I do
[1:30:58] <Prevot> she's like one step away from gushing about fuck fighting
[1:31:06] <JaseAdrift> Woolie like genecide
[1:31:15] <DSD24> Brutal without mercy
[1:31:17] <+Freeborg1997> Guess you and Woolie need to fight, no more discussion about the story
[1:31:23] <MidnightBurst12> genocide is an art
[1:31:24] <+glgzephyr> rip and tear until it is done
[1:31:36] <Lefteron> Like sneaking a hand in your POCKETS
[1:31:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> "strokes" sweetc2SmugCheeks

[1:32:45] <Chatterbox1991> WW1 was the last examplwe of two honorable foes facing off in a major way
[1:32:48] <+glgzephyr> WW1 was the last of the old wars
[1:32:50] <megamirk> NO ESCAPE
[1:32:54] <+glgzephyr> then war became PLAY 2 WIN
[1:33:03] <%krispen_wa> WW1 had gas and the trenches. shit was still fucked
[1:33:03] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:33:05] <%gatorafan> Hunter X Hunter? Kappa
[1:33:10] <siamzero94> I mean there was alot of propaganda on both sides of WW1
[1:33:14] <lotharrio> Red Baron, a man so skilled that even his enemies had a crush on him.
[1:33:20] <xiccy> mods
[1:33:33] <+DoctorHam> WW1 was an early-19th-century war fought with 20th-century weapons, and it was a massacre

[1:34:24] <siamzero94> Woolie, she's getting wet! Get in there!
[1:34:31] <heartlesshealer> The petty revenge and hatred of draining the life batteries before Malak could get to them
[1:34:31] <%SouLucha> Oh, this is different if Revan is light.
[1:34:33] <andrei11dr> It was just a bunh of flurry spam LUL
[1:34:35] <Lefteron> She was driven by her POCKETS
[1:34:41] <@Commando_Joe> You killed a trillion people for power dude
[1:34:43] <%krispen_wa> Malak was driven by thr Dark Side tho. because he was a dumbass
[1:34:43] <muniea3> listen though
[1:34:45] <+Freeborg1997> I mean in Pockets case...
[1:34:45] <@Commando_Joe> That's not grey
[1:34:48] <+DoctorHam> she was driven by that CASH MONEY
[1:34:52] <+Fortunato5678> They absolutely were though
[1:34:54] <Reizie_Etherealm> I remember the force drain on those tube people
[1:34:55] <zenith0111> But the movies disagree unfortunately :(

[1:36:38] <DSD24> @HollowMan190 Nah man Handmaiden is awesome
[1:36:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater Oh, Honestly I want it on PC
[1:36:43] <gruulmagebeast> handmaiden is a little stuck up, but she is a billion times better than disciple
[1:36:54] <DSD24> God the Disciple is lame
[1:36:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater They could even make a Battle Royel mode and make money
[1:36:59] <zenith0111> Considering the lore literally has a Good God and an Evil God really makes this black and white.
[1:37:07] <HollowMan190> her name is handmadain
[1:37:08] <Redblood801> Plot over

[1:39:04] <+DoctorHam> I fuckin loved that music, the March in major
[1:39:06] <+glgzephyr> So the light side theme is actually just the Force's theme

[1:43:55] <Man_in_the_Red> oh it was D-0

[1:44:40] <heartlesshealer> oh boy

[1:46:35] <Halospaz117> @Zanco23 There is a mod to make all the head gear invisible
[1:46:41] <lotharrio> Mask buds.
[1:46:49] <zestyrica> love how the droid is just floating around in the background

[1:47:23] <lotharrio> Just like real life.
[1:47:27] <Fuji808> Oh don't worry, Woolie. Kreia will know.
[1:47:37] <Deadbulky> Big influence
[1:47:40] <AMaidIndeed> It's a dating sim! c:
[1:47:40] <%medinaj1990> s
[1:47:45] <siamzero94> Give it time
[1:47:52] <user_naim> just like real life
[1:48:05] <dereks0n> I always wish games didn't think you pick to say means what you feel
[1:48:09] <%netrac> Pasive mind control
[1:48:16] <Lefteron> PERSONA
[1:48:19] <Jaku2011> Dragon Age 2 as bad as it is had a good solution to that problem
[1:48:37] <%derap41> jus shit all over them
[1:48:40] <+Freeborg1997> That's how it actually works. I tried it for a year, everyone thought I was amazing and wanted to do everything I said.
[1:48:51] <lotharrio> I always have anti-influence with Kreia. She a b
[1:49:01] <+kyh9> @Jaku2011 Dragon Age 2 is actually my favorite DA game, in spite of its jank
[1:49:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FOR NOW
[1:49:15] <hellkhat> yeah telling people what they want to hear works
[1:49:20] <dereks0n> Oh you should've seen Atton and Handmaiden when I was done with them
[1:49:21] <snakemuho> you just take LS hits and then kill a bunch of people when nobody's looking
[1:49:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lotharrio How dare you insult granny!
[1:49:32] <gruulmagebeast> bao dur is tricky but you can get him into a jedi real quick if you know whats up
[1:49:33] <fuji_92> DA2 is great, I legit dont get the hate
[1:49:33] <dorpork> ask Handmaiden to spar with you
[1:49:40] <%SouLucha> If I remember correctly, HK influence as a light side is impossible with out glitches.
[1:49:42] <lotharrio> Granny hates droids. She a b.
[1:49:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gruulmagebeast Shut up
[1:49:47] <Chatterbox1991> @Fujiwara_92 exactly
[1:49:58] <%DatAsuna> @kyh9 fenris is bae
[1:50:11] <Jaku2011> @kyh9 it had the problems as this game interesting ideas but didn't follow up on them cuz devs had a year
[1:50:13] <Chatterbox1991> Merril for life
[1:50:16] <+therabbles> do not spoil in chat
[1:50:19] <WSintai> @DatAsuna Gideon Emery can make anyone sexy
[1:50:22] <Tucker0603> Darth maul is fucking rad
[1:50:27] <%DatAsuna> That was qui-gon
[1:50:28] <Dangerzone979> Merril gang
[1:50:29] <Deadbulky> Maul didnt do that tho
[1:50:30] <%DatAsuna> not maul
[1:50:31] <%derap41> Darth Maul doesn't do that
[1:50:31] <megamirk> Qui Gon, yes
[1:50:32] <Aydarkzero> it was really strong
[1:50:32] <Djinnazz> that was Koi Gon
[1:50:40] <%derap41> Woolie fake nerd
[1:50:44] <DoyesBoyes> @fujiwara_92 DA2 gets hate since it stripped back a lot of the RPG mechanics that DA:O had
[1:50:46] <%gatorafan> reminder that the guys READ chat, just not acknowledge it so behave :)
[1:50:47] <dorpork> what's supposed to be good about dragon age 2?
[1:50:48] <Lefteron> Maul stalks him like a caged tigger
[1:50:54] <WSintai> Qui Gon Chi
[1:51:05] <theKingRamses> obi wan waiting for the hot tag
[1:51:09] <andrei11dr> It's the only personality he shows in that movie LUL
[1:51:09] <+PaladinDupre> Ob
[1:51:10] <megamirk> then Qui Gon got fucked
[1:51:16] <%derap41> Then in 3 you have all tell don't show
[1:51:20] <+PaladinDupre> Obi wan was seething
[1:51:22] <%TRILLTURBAN> Ewan Mcgregor and Ray Park got so good at their lightsaber choreography that they had to slow down the footage in post
[1:51:38] <Chatterbox1991> @wsintai Nah i cant sell you this part and than Quon Chi rides in on a hell beast
[1:51:43] <%Pillagius> Why Qui Gon Jin died in Episode 1? Nobody has stolen his daughter.
[1:51:46] <gruulmagebeast> when maul tries to kill ben kenobi in the same way as qui gon and gets wrecked
[1:51:55] <lotharrio> Maul's compartriots were surprised when he actually spoke.
[1:51:55] <%Irridium> that after-sex glow
[1:51:55] <Jaku2011> @dorpork the way it avoided forcing the player to pander to party members
[1:51:55] <siamzero94> SEXUAL ENERGY
[1:52:00] <hntronium> Its the mask
[1:52:01] <Lefteron> "Thank god im wearing sunglasses
[1:52:16] <Jaku2011> For content

[1:52:55] <andrei11dr> Twerka time
[1:52:58] <megamirk> Jedi Outcast was fucking sick
[1:52:59] <gruulmagebeast> fanny you appear to be glowing with the radiant energy of pure good, whats up with that
[1:53:00] <%Superspider51> Nar Shadda was in Jedi Outcast as well
[1:53:04] <+NiSoKr> CRIME Planet
[1:53:04] <Halospaz117> I fucking love Nar Shaadda
[1:53:08] <SoaringLettuce> one of my favorite action movie moments is when in mission impossible 2, ethan jumps out of cover shooting while talking so the bad guy hets surprised
[1:53:09] <%Superspider51> the other best star wars game
[1:53:09] <Infeirno23> was it in unleashed?
[1:53:09] <1matheuw> he cant go to twerka right now

[1:53:21] <%Superspider51> yeah it's in unleashed as well
[1:53:21] <%derap41> MIKE WAS WRONG
[1:53:23] <+ejn127> LUL
[1:53:24] <Infeirno23> I remember the name narshada
[1:53:24] <%SouLucha> I have not heard of this.
[1:53:25] <+Ixek> Nar Shaddaa is fantastic.
[1:53:26] <Deadbulky> Twitter plot twist
[1:53:27] <siamzero94> MIKE WAS WRONG!
[1:53:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus THey DOUBLE retconed it Palps son is a clone
[1:53:29] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> MIKE IS AO STUPID
[1:53:31] <pyryautio> Mike's so stupid
[1:53:34] <Chatterbox1991> Same\
[1:53:38] <Djinnazz> they're auful
[1:53:39] <%Pillagius> Oh gosh... Snipers on Nar Shadda was such a huge spike in difficulty - loved it
[1:53:41] <%TRILLTURBAN> Mike is a big dum dum
[1:53:41] <DoyesBoyes> Mike is a fucking idiot
[1:53:41] <Tucker0603> FUCK EM FUCK THE SEQUELS
[1:53:42] <Jaku2011> Mike is so stupid
[1:53:43] <lotharrio> They're fine. I just wish they were good.
[1:53:43] <megamirk> sequels are unironically worse than the prequels
[1:53:44] <%derap41> I don't think anyone can hate them you just get "tired" watching them
[1:53:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> FUCK last jedi
[1:53:45] <Lefteron> I loath the sequel trilogy
[1:53:46] <indig0bird> I really like TLJ lol
[1:53:46] <TheoTTree> Nahhh man the ST is reall bad bro
[1:53:50] <dorpork> @Jaku2011 DA2, the game wheere every party member is bisexual purely for the player's sakee, doesn't pander to thee player? You can't be serious
[1:53:51] <Man_in_the_Red> Mike is the biggest Dum Dum
[1:53:52] <Bluewolf544> MIKE IS SO WRONG GUYS
[1:53:55] <SoaringLettuce> i do
[1:53:56] <%TRILLTURBAN> No but throw the lightsaber tho
[1:53:57] <siamzero94> The alcohol is getting to him
[1:54:03] <Redblood801> That was cool
[1:54:03] <@Commando_Joe> Wait, I just got back. Why is everyone shitting on Mike?
[1:54:04] <Chatterbox1991> I really liked the Sequal Trilogy
[1:54:06] <indig0bird> TFA was really disappointing and TRoS in an atrocity
[1:54:11] <+Dustwalker44> I love the squeal trilogy, but damn that third movie could have been better.
[1:54:11] <+CaptainJax> It makes no sense though
[1:54:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:12] <%DatAsuna> Lightspeed, not hyperspace
[1:54:14] <dereks0n> God that was so fucking sick
[1:54:18] <Mechazoic_Era> YES
[1:54:18] <+CaptainJax> Why dont they just ALWAYS do that
[1:54:18] <lotharrio> @Commando_Joe Because a video came out that said he was wrong.
[1:54:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> The Hyperspace kamakazi its cool but IT BREAKES ALL TACTICS IN STARWARS
[1:54:20] <Jaku2011> @dorpork I don't think you understood what I wrote LUL
[1:54:21] <JaseAdrift> That's cool but dumb as fucl
[1:54:22] <%DatAsuna> hyperspace would have failed
[1:54:22] <muniea3> shame it runes absolutely everything
[1:54:23] <%Irridium> loved last jedi honestly
[1:54:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I ruins everything
[1:54:24] <Deadbulky> 1 in a million, which means she had a high chance of escaping
[1:54:25] <+SarcFa> That DESTROYED so much of the universe THO
[1:54:25] <+caffienatedjedi> Cool moment at the cost of why don't they make missiles that do that
[1:54:29] <gruulmagebeast> sequel trilogy is alright but id rather have memes over rey standing there and sensing something
[1:54:32] <%netrac> It's rad but does not follow
[1:54:33] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I am sad I did not get that, my dumb brain instantly just went "Man that woulda been useful to start with"
[1:54:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> That breaks the setting. You can make missiles that do that!
[1:54:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> IT LOOK PRETTY, DUN THINK ABOUT IT
[1:54:35] <Lefteron> I mean it looked cool, but why the never use it
[1:54:37] <%SouLucha> Yep.
[1:54:38] <user_naim> I went in with low expectations and fucking enjoyed myself through them all, but i see the faults
[1:54:38] <+SarcFa> WHY not just hyperspace through the death star
[1:54:39] <+ThaSparren> If only it didnt make every other major space battle in Star Wars pointless
[1:54:40] <+wintrysoma> makes no sense tho
[1:54:40] <+VietcongSamurai> LUL
[1:54:42] <prince_johnny_> Exactly
[1:54:44] <zenith0111> LUL
[1:54:47] <hellkhat> i hated tlj
[1:54:47] <%SouLucha> Absolutely felt the same.
[1:54:50] <theKingRamses> it didn't work in rogue one
[1:54:51] <hellkhat> shit put me to sleep lol
[1:54:54] <+Bluemanzee> And then you wanted to forget what happens next
[1:54:57] <CruxAustralis> what movie are they talking about?
[1:54:59] <%alpacasintophats> I can't stand TLJ
[1:55:00] <+wintrysoma> in the eu they literally had anti-hyperspace gravity generators
[1:55:08] <siamzero94> The entire galaxy could explode and I WOULD FEEL nothing
[1:55:10] <%TRILLTURBAN> "One in a million chance" says TRoS, then proceeds to show it again at the end of the movie
[1:55:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> @SarcFa Why not just attach hyperdrives onto astroids and fuck up entire worlds
[1:55:12] <+jetjagger222> OK movie, terrible as star wars
[1:55:21] <%DatAsuna> THere is a difference
[1:55:22] <SoaringLettuce> rian johnson recently answered a question and said he didnt care about world building and canon, fans need to stop pretending otherwise
[1:55:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Lightspeed is Lightspeed in Hyperspace
[1:55:25] <+Estuko> It's dumb lmao but fucks sake that lightspeed ramming visual effect looked REALLY fucking rad.
[1:55:26] <Lefteron> It WaS OnE In A MiLliOn
[1:55:26] <+CaptainJax> The problem is that if that works, why dont they just always do that?
[1:55:29] <lotharrio> Hyperspace is another dimension they drop into, I think.
[1:55:33] <Timurine> ResidentSleeper
[1:55:35] <Jaku2011> Last Jedi bad
[1:55:36] <hntronium> It looked cool but was dumb
[1:55:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lefteron Then someone else does it in ROS
[1:55:43] <enobara975> nah Last Jedi was a great Star Wars film
[1:55:46] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @estuko so true psaGib
[1:55:51] <+Bluemanzee> @SoaringLettuce I don't think anyone claimed he cared about his job
[1:55:53] <reven229> Hyperspace is a different dimension, you can crash into other stuff in the other dimension
[1:55:53] <StarlitStunner> Hyperspace and Otherspace are literally a different dimension
[1:55:54] <%Irridium> nah it set up Kylo to be the main villain, the new order to get weaker under his rule, the resistance to get stronger, which will end in a big Star Wars™ battle
[1:55:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @enobara975 Nope
[1:56:04] <rowboat_girlyman> Could you disrupt a hyperspace lane by putting debris in the way?
[1:56:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> Rian Johnson is a hack
[1:56:09] <%Irridium> a follow-up basicaly writes itself
[1:56:12] <Lefteron> @enobara975 it really wasnt
[1:56:13] <user_naim> V is my star wars spirit animal
[1:56:14] <%krispen_wa> the last Jedi was good if you ignored everything except the rey, Luke, and Kylo plots
[1:56:14] <specificsongs> remember to 1st person camera kreia
[1:56:15] <%JJCheeker> It was cool but it completely ruins the all previous space battles
[1:56:19] <lotharrio> Yeah, hyperspace is another dimension with different physical laws that let them go faster than the speed of light.
[1:56:19] <%Huttersson> I had the same problem till I heard that they started doing it in ROS. Then I was fine with it.
[1:56:23] <%SouLucha> JJ is a bigger hack.
[1:56:25] <OldLogos> I'm a sasha grey jedi
[1:56:31] <tolloponik> the Writer also says he hates star wars
[1:56:32] <siamzero94> Don't make too strong!
[1:56:33] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE FIGHT FUCK
[1:56:36] <Lefteron> @enobara975 I would link you Mauller if i could
[1:56:37] <Fuji808> JJ is the biggest hack of all.
[1:56:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lotharrio Its that Light in Hyperspace is Many times faster then our space
[1:56:39] <andrei11dr> So you wish they had the balls to do wat this game did
[1:56:39] <+Estuko> Oh shit there's handmaiden, she's super fucking cute. But still no goth wife.
[1:56:45] <%TRILLTURBAN> Weaken the woman so you can fuck her gooder?
[1:56:46] <gruulmagebeast> lightspeed kamikazee and leia shooting stars are my favorite parts of the movie
[1:57:00] <+jetjagger222> leia superman was the worst part of TLJ
[1:57:01] <%JJCheeker> Johnson might be a good director but he is a terrible terrible writer
[1:57:05] <Psyramics> @rowboat_girlyman in the EU, it was gravity wells that needed to be avoided, not matter in general
[1:57:09] <dorpork> @Jaku2011: So why do you praise DA2 for that? in other rpgs party members will permanently leav the player depending on choices. in DA2 party members have so little agency that they change their sexuality deepending on the player's whims
[1:57:10] <snakemuho> keep your woman low level to beat her up easier
[1:57:11] <enobara975> @lefteron Mauler is everything wrong with film crit
[1:57:19] <indig0bird> I knew the movie was not going to followthrough and that sucks
[1:57:20] <lotharrio> Fuck, I just remembered that half of Last Jedi's plot was unneeded and forced drama.
[1:57:24] <%Pillagius> I'm so sad in Last Jedi didn't make Kylo into badass. Like he did what his "idol", Vader couldn't - kill his Master and become THE Master himself. Instead 0 progress, same crybaby cohhFeels
[1:57:27] <indig0bird> The sequel to TLJ, I mean
[1:57:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> @JJCheeker He pretty much admited in an interview that he doesn't care about cannon or world building
[1:57:38] <hellkhat> kylo's rampage in rise of the skywalker prob my fav moment of the new trilogy
[1:57:45] <Timurine> I thought chat was joking
[1:57:51] <gruulmagebeast> how do you do that?
[1:57:54] <%JJCheeker> The Star Wars story group doesn't seem to care either
[1:57:54] <siamzero94> RADIATING WITH SEX ENERGY
[1:57:54] <Lefteron> @enobara975 Would you like to elaborate?
[1:57:57] <heartlesshealer> niiiice detail
[1:58:03] <+caffienatedjedi> I didn't even know this wsas a thing, awesome
[1:58:07] <andrei11dr> 14 months
[1:58:07] <+Ancopro> so lets see who are the secret villians
[1:58:12] <theKingRamses> eagle vision is cool
[1:58:12] <%JJCheeker> Neither Kathleen Kennedy
[1:58:17] <WSintai> T3 just staring at your crotch
[1:58:27] <+Estuko> @hellkhat I kinda liked that he just flailed about super angrily
[1:58:34] <Rafikator> henlo
[1:58:38] <heartlesshealer> So he's keeping Kreia out and not tech boy?
[1:58:47] <+Freeborg1997> I always auto-level the companions
[1:58:53] <gruulmagebeast> is there a major downside to auto leveling
[1:58:55] <Rafikator> one of the first times catching stream
[1:59:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @JJCheeker A ton of writers these days don't understand why the universe is so important to the world. Like the Doctor who writer, and the star Trek writers
[1:59:22] <%JJCheeker> Indeed
[1:59:23] <Jaku2011> @dorpork I wasn't even talking about romance dude fucking chill. I was talking about missing out on content like conversations or side quests cuz the character doesn't like you problems DAO had.
[1:59:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> Hell Marvel and DC also are doign the same mistakes
[1:59:31] <%JJCheeker> Star Trek especially
[1:59:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> God Picard is so bad
[1:59:40] <%DatAsuna> Hyperspace ain't lightspeed
[1:59:44] <@Commando_Joe> Picard is fun
[1:59:45] <siamzero94> @gruulmagebeast Well there's no respec so any fuck up by the system is permanent
[1:59:46] <%DatAsuna> but youneed lightspeed to get into it
[1:59:50] <+Bluemanzee> At least we still have The Expanseotherwise I'd think there was a conspiracy to ruin sci-fi
[1:59:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> The Doctor Who one though is just a spit in the face of all whovians
[1:59:57] <hellkhat> @Estuko yeah more so the idea and shots than the actual combat all the lightsaber play in the new trilogy is ASS no one can fight lol
[2:00:01] <+jetjagger222> @Bluemanzee wait for dune
[2:00:03] <@Commando_Joe> It's not 'high brow, the federation is a bastion of light', which I enjoy
[2:00:03] <%JJCheeker> The problem with Star Trek nowadays is that the writers writing it don't know Star Trek
[2:00:10] <heartlesshealer> drop menu
[2:00:17] <%madogod> yo woolie upload the rest of doom
[2:00:21] <@Commando_Joe> Picard is like all the dank shit that happened in DS9 cranked up to 11
[2:00:24] <+Bluemanzee> @jetjagger222 That sounds promising
[2:00:24] <%krispen_wa> Lightsaber forms are just DMC styles
[2:00:25] <+therabbles> star treks smile and optimism is gone
[2:00:32] <%alpacasintophats> TIME TO MAKE A WITHDRAWL
[2:00:36] <+Estuko> @krispen_wa fuck, lmao
[2:00:39] <Redblood801> Hey guys
[2:00:39] <%DatAsuna> big thonk
[2:00:40] <+Estuko> LMFAO
[2:00:45] <+caffienatedjedi> That guy, casually strolling past 3 HK-50s
[2:00:46] <%alpacasintophats> or not
[2:00:49] <gruulmagebeast> oh boy a welcoming party
[2:00:50] <Redblood801> HEYO
[2:00:50] <megamirk> damn LUL
[2:00:52] <xThomasWellertonx> Oh no
[2:00:55] <siamzero94> How the fuck did the-- oh right: TSF
[2:00:56] <Blazeofflame> Yo what's popin' my Ds?
[2:00:58] <%Superspider51> suicide is painless
[2:00:58] <+Bluemanzee> yeyeyey
[2:00:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[2:01:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Bluemanzee Its not Scifi its most writing. A bunch of Idiologs want to kill modern myths and replace them with their shit
[2:01:01] <Redblood801> Suicide is badass
[2:01:02] <%Superspider51> it brings on so many changes
[2:01:05] <Lefteron> "You have angered the mighty Caesar"
[2:01:09] <+Estuko> PogChamp Little V using the Yamato on himself = Maximilian_Dood ???
[2:01:11] <lotharrio> Suicide is painless. It brings on many changes. And I can take or leave it, if I try.
[2:01:12] <%DatAsuna> It was to do with shields
[2:01:12] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:01:18] <%DatAsuna> and power escalation
[2:01:29] <DSD24> Because its stupid to have that option NOW of all times
[2:01:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Bluemanzee Similar things happened in the past speciffically in Nazi germany and Soviet Russia.
[2:01:46] <+caffienatedjedi> Should have gotten that bromance going
[2:01:50] <lotharrio> Finn and Poe going on a casino adventure would have been dope.
[2:01:51] <%TRILLTURBAN> THEY COULD'VE MADE ROSE THE HACKER THEY HAD TO FIND
[2:01:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEEYEYEYE
[2:02:02] <hellkhat> when finn IS the love interest lol
[2:02:03] <+Estuko> Fuck me HK
[2:02:04] <%netrac> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[2:02:08] <+Ixek> My issue entirely comes from Disney wanting nothing to do with the EU, which is where my favorite stuff comes from. So I want nothing to do with Disney Star Wars.
[2:02:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Man, I'm glad I didn't see RotSw
[2:02:09] <judgefudge9> Finnpoe fo life
[2:02:14] <WSintai> RIP that one dude there
[2:02:15] <Man_in_the_Red> if Leia did the kamikaze, then one could reason it was an explosion of Force, then they wouldnt have to parade around her corpse for episode 9
[2:02:15] <siamzero94> GET FUCKED FAKERS
[2:02:17] <StarlitStunner> Meatbag
[2:02:21] <+Nobrev> why didnt the resistance ship just turn off their thrusters to save fuel? theres no friction in space so they wouldn't lose speed
[2:02:21] <Graywolf_the_45th> and then Rose got left behind and Finn found a new girl
[2:02:21] <%augurgewalt> augurgewalt subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:02:22] <Jaku2011> First 20 or so minutes of the Force awakens is my favorite
[2:02:23] <gruulmagebeast> "Unnecessary Observation" thats amazing LUL
[2:02:33] <SoaringLettuce> he created rose because poe and finn got along too well, he said as much, its all terrible
[2:02:39] <+Pajex_> LOUDER FeelsGoodMan
[2:02:40] <siamzero94> it's fine
[2:02:40] <Tucker0603> MY EARS
[2:02:41] <@Commando_Joe> destroy droid REALLY loud
[2:02:41] <rowboat_girlyman> game sound loud
[2:02:41] <Matermind0> I love their little team rocket intro
[2:02:43] <+Bluemanzee> @doc_ock_rokc All I know is I haven't been nearly as interested in watching movies or tv shows since I was in highschool. Feels like nobody's trying anymore
[2:02:45] <+Tomas2886Cz> LOUD
[2:02:45] <heartlesshealer> Remains
[2:02:46] <rowboat_girlyman> lightning is loud AF
[2:02:48] <+Estuko> I didn't watch the rest of the movies, is Captain Phasma as cool as her armour and cape
[2:02:49] <TheoTTree> What a hero
[2:02:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Man_in_the_Red I'd be happy about that. I wouldn't like it but I'd be happier. Also if Akbar did it
[2:02:51] <%augurgewalt> Kreia best girl
[2:02:52] <gruulmagebeast> destroy audio
[2:02:56] <muniea3> caught for illegal parking
[2:02:57] <Cygnar527> when did they start?
[2:03:00] <siamzero94> YEYEYEYE
[2:03:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @rowboat_girlyman LOWER YOUR OWM VOLUME
[2:03:02] <judgefudge9> There were some parts of TLJ that I was down with. Only some tho
[2:03:04] <rubbishbinge> Big sounds
[2:03:04] <bleugh> LOUD
[2:03:05] <+jetjagger222> @Estuko she's the best character from the sequels /s
[2:03:06] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @estuko sadly no
[2:03:10] <+Estuko> Fuck
[2:03:11] <%CyanDeadEye> Its been a while, but HK-50s don't spawn in the vanilla version on Telos right?
[2:03:13] <lotharrio> @Cygnar527 Around 1:30 or so.
[2:03:14] <+SarcFa> The problem with hyperspace kamikaze is that it would've literally solved all the space battles in prior movies in seconds
[2:03:24] <%Pillagius> Well, "lightspeed kamikaze" issue is... why not make missles that's basically a lightspeed engine with some navigation/targeting capabilities? The ship also probably has a ton of failsafes to prevent something like being launched into an object.
[2:03:25] <Cygnar527> thanks
[2:03:32] <SoaringLettuce> everyone in chat, if you wanna have a laugh, go and watch Tron: Legacy and TLJ back to back
[2:03:34] <+jetjagger222> @Estuko random melee trooper from TFA ended up being a bigger badass
[2:03:39] <%netrac> lighspeed torpedos
[2:03:41] <notenoughgirls> random-ish hk encounters are added by the mod
[2:03:44] <akman14> Thanix cannon?
[2:03:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> I always grab Force Deflect just for the bonus on the roll.
[2:03:45] <lotharrio> Some of T3's arms are amazing.
[2:03:48] <+therabbles> they just needed to add a line in the movie that said "yea we do this kamikaze shit but its not economically viable"
[2:03:51] <DSD24> @SoaringLettuce Tron Legacy has amazing music
[2:03:53] <gruulmagebeast> when will t3 get a PROTON CANNON
[2:03:53] <+SarcFa> Death star, kamikaze, overwhelmed by huge fleet in a pincer manuever, kamikaze, blockaded a world, kamikaze
[2:04:06] <+Estuko> @jetjagger222 I liked that trooper, but its kinda hard for me to be impressed by other troopers that aren't Commandos or Clone Assassins (Episode 3 game)
[2:04:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @SarcFa It doesn't just solve everything it makes everythign super hard. Why have a earth base when a 10,000 KG object striking the earth at 99% the speed of light would crack a planet
[2:04:10] <Jaku2011> @soaringlettuce ok I'll bite, why
[2:04:13] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @estuko she did look....they even made her say the Traitor line at Finn to make her cool. That did not work
[2:04:15] <%netrac> But is hard not to justify spending a medium ship against a death star
[2:04:21] <Man_in_the_Red> Star Wars sucks when it rhymes, we can all agree on that
[2:04:33] <%CyanDeadEye> CyanDeadEye subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:04:38] <zenith0111> So wouldn't hijacking ships just to LS Kamikaze be the new strat? Why risk their own resources?
[2:04:39] <+RealThiele> x-wings could destroy your enemies ability to make war if they hit a planet like that
[2:04:39] <Redblood801> Time to visit the ATM
[2:04:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> @SarcFa In a world with HSK there is no reason to have any force beyond a fleet of xwings
[2:04:49] <zenith0111> Star Wars is dumb
[2:04:50] <hellkhat> honestly u could just build shits with ai and lightspeed and throw it at planets
[2:04:54] <%Pillagius> @doc_ock_rokc or why bother making a huge space station, like Death Star - some moron can take it out in a snap
[2:04:58] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @jetjagger222 Tr-8R is the best
[2:05:00] <hellkhat> *ships
[2:05:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @zenith0111 Just build that into a missile

[2:11:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @pan_nochal exactly. She respons with a Extreme by assuming extremes
[2:11:42] <%JJCheeker> I bet she is pro slavery
[2:11:48] <%SouLucha> Kreia is still best.
[2:11:49] <%gatorafan> the Ukranian grandma
[2:11:55] <+RealThiele> racist grandma got force powers and a laser sword
[2:11:59] <+prime_name> I got an uncle like that
[2:12:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> @pan_nochal that said you still need to teach a man to fish
[2:12:00] <xThomasWellertonx> Not every sith needs to be evil there was one who specifically NEVER did anything evil, like EVER
[2:12:09] <%Pillagius> @gatorafan yea, pretty much...
[2:12:11] <+Estuko> NotLikeThis had experience with racist grandma/grandpa's ... lmfao
[2:12:12] <leonsnixon> Very sith thing to say
[2:12:14] <%augurgewalt> tfw Woolie doesn't want to wear the sweater of darkness made by his kindly evil grandma
[2:12:15] <%Ashenik1> my polish family....
[2:12:15] <reven229> But they're unbreakable
[2:12:15] <gruulmagebeast> but diamond is unbreakable?
[2:12:19] <%TRILLTURBAN> There's diamond drill bits
[2:12:21] <Chatterbox1991> @gatorafan my mom and sister litterally worked for a Ukrrainian grandma
[2:12:22] <lotharrio> Diamonds are mostly just good for cutting things.
[2:12:28] <%netrac> But is the strongest rock
[2:12:29] <xThomasWellertonx> he died of old age in his home surrounded by friends and family but was a sith
[2:12:29] <%Superspider51> number 1
[2:12:32] <megamirk> @doc_ock_rokc not what I meant, I meant that her line of thinking doesn't work ONLY in extreme situations - like Woolie said - if you don't help someone they'll die
[2:12:33] <Deadbulky> 1
[2:12:35] <Infeirno23> would she had said the same stuff if he chose the suffering in the galaxy one?
[2:12:37] <+wintrysoma> who cares about being "strong"
[2:12:41] <fuji_92> Unbreakable rock
[2:12:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> EVOLVE OR DIE DANTE
[2:12:51] <+InvisibleBlimps> That sounds like Pat lol
[2:12:52] <Dangerzone979> @xthomaswellertonx He was a capitalist, that's pretty evil
[2:12:53] <megamirk> @doc_ock_rokc but as a human you're hard-wired to evolve through tackling new challenges
[2:12:54] <gruulmagebeast> its not just a gem, its a ROCK
[2:12:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @TRILLTURBAN before diamond was used in such ways it was only valuable because it was shiny
[2:12:55] <+wintrysoma> fucking anime MOTTO TSUYOKU NARITAI bullshit
[2:12:57] <WSintai> I for one, am content to be a huge bitch
[2:13:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> Pressure also creates blood splattered remains on the ground and walls if applied adequately enough but ok
[2:13:03] <Redblood801> @xthomaswellertonx Darth Vectivus is so cool
[2:13:10] <%gatorafan> Oh, are we entering Maddentown again?
[2:13:14] <Prevot> oof
[2:13:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[2:13:22] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @xthomaswellertonx
[2:13:22] <zenith0111> BUT I AGREE WITH HER
[2:13:25] <+RealThiele> LUL get fucked marriage is expensive fuckers
[2:13:27] <lotharrio> My mom told my brother he was "living in sin" with his girlfriend.
[2:13:29] <+saltpiggu> My parents are still like this
[2:13:29] <%krispen_wa> ah shit here we go
[2:13:31] <muniea3> but then who's going to wash your socks?
[2:13:31] <OldManDeckardCain> kreia would totally be like "fuck social programs, pull yourself up by your own boot straps" LUL
[2:13:31] <fuji_92> OOF
[2:13:35] <leonsnixon> We getting real
[2:13:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> @pan_nochal Its not just human. all lving things from plants to bacteria even Viruses if you concider them living evolve through strife
[2:13:43] <lotharrio> My dad looked at her and told her she was crazy.
[2:13:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Fuck that rent sucks
[2:13:46] <+Estuko> @xthomaswellertonx NotLikeThis ow my ears
[2:13:47] <%DatAsuna> how's that divorce rate going for ya?
[2:13:49] <zenith0111> Breaking up and having to move your shit out sucks calebS
[2:13:56] <megamirk> @doc_ock_rokc yeah, so Kreia is right, in essence
[2:13:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @zenith0111 Then you're part of the probleem
[2:14:03] <+RealThiele> parents want you to drop 20k+ on a spendy bullshit thing and want you to get a house
[2:14:03] <lotharrio> Same reason you get a dog before you make a kid.
[2:14:03] <WSintai> "Listen, sometimes you gotta get your dick wet, amirite Mom?"
[2:14:12] <%netrac> TL;DR Ok Boomer
[2:14:13] <hellkhat> road trip sounds betetr
[2:14:16] <akman14> If she ever brings that up remind her how her marriage ended
[2:14:16] <zenith0111> @ballerswagbro9k What narrative is this?
[2:14:19] <%JJCheeker> Marriage doesn't change anything
[2:14:23] <Deadbulky> Gotta know what u likelong term
[2:14:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> @pan_nochal and to extremes she is also wrong. Humans are super social creatures aand thus support specialization and such
[2:14:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @zenith0111 oops sorry wrong name
[2:14:35] <siamzero94> @pan_nochal I would argue that due to our tribal lifestyle were we still depend on each other, that we need that extra outside help sometimes
[2:14:43] <zenith0111> Always move in with your girlfriend. It's no biggie Kappa
[2:14:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> Compatibility testing can help reduce long term friction from constant interaction
[2:14:46] <hellkhat> at that point im like why am i getting married
[2:14:47] <WSintai> @RealThiele I mean, I also WANT to buy a house
[2:14:47] <Prevot> damn
[2:14:49] <tolloponik> @akman14 shit man wtf
[2:14:49] <leonsnixon> Road trips can make or break a relationship
[2:14:51] <hellkhat> we doing the same thing lol
[2:14:55] <Deadbulky> BIG SHADE
[2:14:58] <Prevot> woolie with the truth nukes
[2:14:59] <JetpackMcQuack> F
[2:15:02] <Jaku2011> But I need prep time!

[2:15:32] <+Bluemanzee> Boomer are dwarves basically
[2:15:32] <megamirk> @doc_ock_rokc @siamzero94 I think she's talking specifically about situations in which you take someone's struggles away from them, which weakens them in the long term, not anything else
[2:15:33] <lotharrio> The consequences of sending an entire generation to college.
[2:15:35] <Deadbulky> ERROR DOES NOT COMPUTE
[2:15:43] <+Bluemanzee> I bet they even have a book of grudges
[2:15:53] <+saltpiggu> Woolie uses force power Destroy Boomer
[2:15:55] <megamirk> Kreia's kind of a contrarian dick sometimes though
[2:16:02] <arkv01> imagine sending your kids to college and they come back to crush your world views
[2:16:03] <+wintrysoma> "sometimes"
[2:16:05] <zenith0111> Ye ye projecting hours
[2:16:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> @pan_nochal yes she is but she also points out the benifits of taking over the problem
[2:16:18] <zenith0111> I'm gaining free insight
[2:16:20] <xThomasWellertonx> That's why the grey jedi are the best side
[2:16:21] <%augurgewalt> @pan_nochal that is literally her philosophy regarding what the ideal teacher is

[2:21:25] <%derap41> Who could the third be
[2:21:27] <+jetjagger222> you'll be able to hear it if you finish a bag of chips
[2:21:30] <+Freeborg1997> How does the Exile know Darth Sion's name?
[2:21:33] <lotharrio> V is a creature of betrayals.
[2:21:34] <Deadbulky> Hmmmmm
[2:21:34] <zenith0111> CRAZY TALK is a parasitic stand that spreads but only on people who are emotionally close to the other person
[2:21:38] <%That_Mojo> all good mr V mills
[2:21:42] <+Bluemanzee> He contracted CRAZY TALK from Woolie, who carries it but has no symptoms as a way for Pat to spread it
[2:21:44] <fuji_92> Its cool V
[2:21:47] <gruulmagebeast> V is bathing pain
[2:21:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lotharrio So it is writen
[2:21:55] <%DatAsuna> Pat told woolie
[2:22:09] <tolloponik> No Time!
[2:22:10] <%tattleworm> just blame it on the force bond

[2:22:23] <Zebroneath> On Korriban, I believe.
[2:22:23] <%Irridium> pat told woolie and then edited the game's text files
[2:22:23] <+glgzephyr> There's no time!
[2:22:24] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus he felt it through the force?
[2:22:26] <lotharrio> The ally conversations are janked like that.
[2:22:30] <dellis80> its the force???

[2:22:42] <%Irridium> sick name

[2:23:33] <dukenux> WHACK HIM
[2:23:35] <+Freeborg1997> They say Sion's name once. But they never say Mask Boy's name.

[2:23:50] <lotharrio> The best part of any series is when they introduce you to a squad of villains. Always awesome. Except in Bleach, where it's overused and lacks impact.

[2:24:24] <%DatAsuna> It's actually referring to cut content in part

[2:25:03] <%strugglepunk2> makes sense
[2:25:06] <dorpork> 'she' is referring to cut content. 'she' was originally supposed to be someone else
[2:25:07] <%augurgewalt> It's barely a mystery who the betrayer is even in-game

[2:25:43] <snakemuho> what a misterious Jogo
[2:25:44] <megamirk> Gappy has four balls
[2:25:45] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Is it because he’s a Blanka player
[2:26:00] <lotharrio> That was one of the coolest things in Exalted. One of the most powerful characters could hear anyone who says her name, or reads it, or thinks about her. So when she's brought up in the books, they call her M*RA.
[2:26:03] <%SouLucha> woolieMIRIN
[2:26:06] <%krispen_wa> In the end, does it matter if you know she's untrustworthy?

[2:38:33] <$genocidal_cupcake> Am i cheering eveytime i type?
[2:38:36] <Prevot> the flesh is stronger than the force

[2:38:55] <andrei11dr> Just like the real priests
[2:38:55] <Blazeofflame> Reven, did you fuck my waifu's mom?
[2:38:56] <manwithaxe> anti sex kreia
[2:39:02] <lotharrio> The only reason it makes sense, is if there was a point where the Jedi were encouraged to have kids, and they ended up making super Jedi babies who all went dark side.
[2:39:02] <gruulmagebeast> strong in the force, and in bed
[2:39:03] <+wintrysoma> i heard she had the biggest tits in the galaxy
[2:39:06] <%AWKWARDL0SER> Weird how repressing sex & love doesn’t work out for everyone 🤷🏻♀️
[2:39:08] <siamzero94> DO IT
[2:39:15] <+Exicuren> TRAIN HER!!!!!!!!
[2:39:19] <+jetjagger222> DEW IT
[2:39:21] <Deadbulky> Continue the redfield heratige
[2:39:23] <muniea3> gray side granny fucks for sure
[2:39:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> If Force Sensitivity is genetic, then why the fuck are kids forbidden? Breed that shit!
[2:39:28] <StarlitStunner> Force eugenics
[2:39:29] <invisi_bliss> Karren?
[2:39:29] <gruulmagebeast> literally tells you to kill the bloodline wow

[2:39:41] <%augurgewalt> Can you blame her? Imagine a hunky Echani dude came onto you
[2:39:42] <StarlitStunner> Force kekai genkai

[2:39:56] <zenith0111> @generalscpatton More child soldier monks cultists!
[2:40:07] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> I mean, they really only ban relationships. Those aren’t necessarily needed.
[2:40:07] <Deadbulky> Curious choice of words granny
[2:40:09] <JaseAdrift> LET JEDI FUCK
[2:40:11] <+ThaSparren> It was also said they closed themselves to the force so if they were sensitive they couldnt feel it
[2:40:14] <leonsnixon> Kreia suffered indignities
[2:40:16] <+obscureanimeguy> So she’s Bayonetta
[2:40:18] <Fixer997> FUCK THE HANDMAIDEN, WOOLIE
[2:40:21] <xThomasWellertonx> bayo rulles, don't let the two clans fuck or the world ends?
[2:40:22] <+Exicuren> TRAIN HER AND WAIFU HER
[2:40:40] <%augurgewalt> Atris is just a Cult leader
[2:40:40] <+Ancopro> no nut no-never
[2:40:44] <BurdRightsActivist> Kreia: Just get stronger 4Head
[2:40:45] <zenith0111> Don't give into the dark side... but let's gointo INTERGALACTIC WAR
[2:40:47] <+Bluemanzee> "Don't continue her bloodline or yours for that matter." - Kreia
[2:40:57] <mudapersona> Power up Waifu !
[2:40:58] <StarlitStunner> Albino fight wife
[2:40:59] <%krispen_wa> Chris - LET THE BLOODLINE LIVE
[2:41:14] <lotharrio> If Atris really wants to do that, there are aliens that are just naturally immune to mind tricks. Those anti-semite parodies with wings, for example.
[2:41:15] <heartlesshealer> TEACH HER THE WAY OF THE SITH
[2:41:17] <reven229> You can be trained in the force.... Not by a jedi
[2:41:17] <hntronium> UNLIMITED
[2:41:19] <Deadbulky> Just learn the force
[2:41:21] <hntronium> POWA
[2:41:27] <+Exicuren> DEM LOOPHOLES
[2:41:29] <rubbishbinge> Power unlimit
[2:41:29] <siamzero94> As it should be
[2:41:30] <gruulmagebeast> jeez kreia not jedi then what should she be hmmmmmm
[2:41:39] <zenith0111> GIVE IN THE SON GOD
[2:41:40] <Dangerzone979> Labes are a construsct
[2:41:41] <+therabbles> Kreia likes contractual loopholes
[2:41:42] <+VHGS> Unspecified non-infringing Space Wizard
[2:41:45] <heartlesshealer> Teach her the way of Pockets
[2:41:48] <zenith0111> NO GREY JEDIS WORSHIP THE SON
[2:41:48] <%MeatBomb> They say Mon Calamari Jedi like it better, down were it's wetter. Under the c... IT'S a TRAP!
[2:41:54] <zenith0111> OR FATHER OR WHATEVER
[2:41:57] <SheefEatsBeef> THE GREATER EVIL
[2:41:59] <GarbageNirvana> I mean there's force-sensitives in the galaxy that have no idea what Jedi and Sith are right
[2:42:01] <%DatAsuna> adjust monocle
[2:42:02] <+PenmanLupine> spaghetti?
[2:42:06] <Fuji808> This is Luke's precise philosophy in The Last Jedi. To claim that the Jedi die, the Force dies, is hubris.
[2:42:13] <+Exicuren> I'll teach how to be a jedi, but you are totally not going to be a jedi
[2:42:16] <leonsnixon> The force doesn’t care about your religion
[2:42:18] <lotharrio> There's only Jedi and Sith... and Night Sisters... and like seventeen other disciplines.
[2:42:18] <manwithaxe> sunni and shi'ite force users
[2:42:26] <zenith0111> I really wish I never knew about the Force Gods NotLikeeThis
[2:42:28] <dellis80> I LOVED the concept of the Witches/Sisters from Fallen Order
[2:42:29] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> 2 for Kriea dialouge
[2:42:33] <zenith0111> Ruined Grey Jedis
[2:42:34] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[2:42:35] <%SouLucha> The force just doesn't care.
[2:42:38] <+glgzephyr> POWERRRRR
[2:42:44] <SoaringLettuce> the line about this in tlj is the only thingi like from that movie
[2:42:46] <%That_Mojo> clothed and unclothed fuck fighting
[2:42:52] <+Estuko> PUT YOUR DICK AWAY
[2:42:52] <heartlesshealer> "fuck romance"
[2:42:53] <%augurgewalt> Kreia is just Anti-Abe "Don't procreate"
[2:42:54] <lotharrio> Also there's that Ewok movie that just has a straight up witch in it. That's confusing.
[2:42:55] <arkv01> god jedi are SUPER blue balled, they can probably fuckfight like tigers
[2:42:56] <Lefteron> To the pussy
[2:42:56] <%Pillagius> Kraya is being jelous
[2:42:58] <+taggerung403> the nightsisters are a thing as non-jedi or sith force users
[2:43:02] <hellkhat> galaxy before hoes
[2:43:04] <JetpackMcQuack> So THAT's why Reylo exists
[2:43:05] <Redblood801> Make sure to leave room for the force
[2:43:07] <hattrick61> fuck and fight, until it is done.

[3:10:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> Dragon Age Origin is the shit
[3:10:31] <%DatAsuna> It's no daemon ex machina :P
[3:10:37] <+FrenchTact1cs> @augurgewalt Yes you can, Handmaiden got butt hurt my influence was far higher with Visas and refused to talk to me
[3:10:38] <andrei11dr> Woolie like to just talk
[3:10:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Do not doubt the power of Chris Avellone!
[3:10:48] <dorpork> Dragon Age: Origins is just a generic fantasy epic. it doeesn't hold a candle to this game writing-wise
[3:10:50] <%Irridium> Black Isle
[3:10:50] <PinkSocks> black isle
[3:10:52] <lotharrio> Black Isle
[3:10:53] <%DatAsuna> Black Isle
[3:10:53] <theKingRamses> black isle?
[3:10:53] <+wintrysoma> literally can't replay fo3 because everyone in megatton is so fucking twee to hammer in THESE ARE THE GOOD GUYS
[3:10:55] <+Neale2theMusic> interplay???
[3:10:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Black Isle
[3:10:56] <siamzero94> Black isle studios
[3:10:57] <Zebroneath> Black Isle Studios
[3:11:00] <+Neale2theMusic> black isle yeah
[3:11:00] <%DatAsuna> Hence why they named it Obsidian
[3:11:00] <+Ixek> I thought it was Interplay.
[3:11:07] <StarlitStunner> Black Isles and Interplay
[3:11:17] <%Ashenik1> Woolie Witcher also has the quality writing like KOTOR 2 :3
[3:11:20] <%augurgewalt> Kotor 2 has strong Planescape: Torment energy
[3:11:21] <+withguac> Jews?
[3:11:30] <+Neale2theMusic> no
[3:11:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> @augurgewalt Yeyeye
[3:11:34] <siamzero94> Interplay was the publisher
[3:11:38] <%JJCheeker> It's got a good atmosphere
[3:11:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[3:11:40] <+Neale2theMusic> Jawas
[3:11:49] <zenith0111> Witcher 3 is a great Tv show. But KOTR2 might be my new favorite tv show
[3:11:52] <+Neale2theMusic> bad
[3:11:52] <+jetjagger222> the last jedi
[3:11:53] <lotharrio> "Last" Jedi.
[3:12:04] <+withguac> Play singularity it’s by Black Isle
[3:12:09] <%Irridium> they're not after the galaxy or anything, they're after YOU
[3:12:11] <ALTRNico> !uptime
[3:12:11] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 23 minutes
[3:12:21] <%SouLucha> HUR HUR HUR
[3:12:24] <%augurgewalt> yet
[3:12:31] <%DatAsuna> The best stuff in swtor is personal stakes too
[3:12:37] <lotharrio> Yeah, previous game was a fight for the galaxy. This is a manhunt with assassins dogging you daily.
[3:12:46] <+Fortunato5678> The final threat is arguably way bigger than anything else though
[3:12:47] <+jetjagger222> when's raid shadow legends
[3:12:49] <T_Sasquatch> Homecoming is a weird movie
[3:12:57] <%DatAsuna> You'd be surprised
[3:12:59] <+wintrysoma> i mean big hungry boy is a threat but he's fairly out of the way
[3:13:04] <+glgzephyr> Battlefront 2
[3:13:04] <Infeirno23> Kriea did make it sound galaxy ending though
[3:13:07] <lotharrio> KOTOR was during a war. You just weren't on the front lines.
[3:13:09] <%DatAsuna> You don't have to be a soldier during a war
[3:13:10] <+democrazyyy> swtor does that well even with the war setting
[3:13:18] <+kyh9> Clone Wars TV show is too good
[3:13:20] <+glgzephyr> Republic Commando was the shit tho
[3:13:30] <%DatAsuna> well swtor both has the war and the cold war
[3:13:33] <+kyh9> Talk about Clone Wars!
[3:13:34] <%augurgewalt> swtor does few things well, but the original class stories were fairly good
[3:13:35] <+prime_name> Kotor style Clone Wars game would be nice to see.
[3:13:41] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Republic Commando was so damn good
[3:13:49] <hellkhat> reconstruction
[3:13:57] <%DatAsuna> I love RC but it's very much a straightforward war story
[3:14:02] <+kyh9> @DatAsuna Well SWTOR is almost entirely cold-war. Even KOTET and KOTFE are more about occupation than war
[3:14:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> EU had that
[3:14:17] <%VCRUZZO> we done for today?
[3:14:18] <zenith0111> I just realized.... I have no idea what the conflict over the war is
[3:14:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> Luke trying to rebuild the Jedi. Leia dealing with the republic
[3:14:26] <%JJCheeker> They are going to take a break
[3:14:27] <%DatAsuna> I apologize for the many messages from me
[3:14:27] <lotharrio> Just killing the Emperor shouldn't end the Empire. Their home planet was still standing and there should still be fleets.
[3:14:28] <%VCRUZZO> I walked away
[3:14:34] <T_Sasquatch> Did you guys know the rey and kylo kiss isn't romantic Kappa
[3:14:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS GOOD
[3:14:36] <%Irridium> Origins is fucking LONG though
[3:14:40] <%derap41> Its good but kinda yank
[3:14:41] <DSD24> Origins was so good
[3:14:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SO LIKE LIFE?
[3:14:50] <%derap41> Elf make best mage
[3:14:50] <fuji_92> Origins is great
[3:14:50] <%Irridium> 20 episodes in the Deep Roads
[3:14:58] <+Ixek> People will also treat you based on your race, to a degree. It's pretty great.
[3:14:59] <snakemuho> just like Elden Ring
[3:15:00] <$Shotred> this just started?
[3:15:05] <lotharrio> The start of DA:O completely defines how you view the setting.
[3:15:08] <Chatterbox1991> Origins is fucking amazing
[3:15:09] <DSD24> @Shotred No it hasn't
[3:15:13] <Zayasu> @Shotred no they are going to take a break
[3:15:15] <+BionoidLCR> @Shotred no lol
[3:15:17] <%DatAsuna> @lotharrio it didn't, in legend the empire went for decades after. but in canon it all ends in 1 year at jakku cause of battlefront 2 shit
[3:15:17] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> The last truly great Bioware game
[3:15:17] <%derap41> It has aged some
[3:15:19] <+prime_name> How LP-Friendly is Origins?
[3:15:20] <Iwashi94> at least Dragon Age has a better Carth
[3:15:20] <+FrenchTact1cs> Origins is the best one, sadly
[3:15:24] <zenith0111> I couldn't stand playing Orgins.
[3:15:24] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Only consistently good Dragon Age game
[3:15:33] <DSD24> Eh I don't think Orgins is LP friendly
[3:15:33] <zenith0111> Did not care for the gameplay
[3:15:33] <%JJCheeker> I only like origins
[3:15:34] <Chatterbox1991> Origins has the Best carth
[3:15:35] <lotharrio> @DatAsuna Sucks.
[3:15:42] <theKingRamses> origins is probably the only one you'd need to play
[3:15:43] <%DatAsuna> Yeah canon sucks that way a lot
[3:15:49] <snakemuho> @prime_name there's a bit too much running around
[3:15:51] <$Shotred> guess I'll go back when its done
[3:15:51] <DSD24> 1 is great 2 is bad
[3:15:52] <fuji_92> Yeah, DAO Carth is actually good
[3:15:55] <%VCRUZZO> mine too
[3:15:56] <hero1151> Alistair is best Carth
[3:15:56] <%derap41> Everything after Origin sucks ass
[3:16:01] <%VCRUZZO> yup
[3:16:03] <lotharrio> I played a mage and was sympathetic to them the entire series. A friend didn't, and just thought that all mages should be executed on sight because they're too dangerous.
[3:16:03] <%Irridium> Not even. There's like 4
[3:16:05] <T_Sasquatch> I only played and really liked Inquisition
[3:16:05] <fuji_92> DA2 IS GREAT THO
[3:16:06] <+taggerung403> DA2 DLC with the architect was fun
[3:16:07] <StarlitStunner> 2 had great characters and story
[3:16:10] <%augurgewalt> DA2 is a mess with some neat ideas and DA:I is the most depressing mediocrity imagineable
[3:16:10] <%medinaj1990> two isn't bad for what it is but it doesn't live up to Origins
[3:16:10] <+jetjagger222> did NWN2 have a carth
[3:16:11] <GarbageNirvana> 2 feels like it was rushed in places
[3:16:12] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Just downhill from Origins
[3:16:14] <+democrazyyy> 2 has a great story and crew
[3:16:15] <+Fortunato5678> Inquisition is alright, 2 is ass
[3:16:17] <%DatAsuna> DA2 is about one city changing over time
[3:16:18] <siamzero94> Origins is a pretty high bar to cross
[3:16:20] <CastellanVon> I like 2 but it’s not as good as origins
[3:16:21] <available_line> Origins and Inquisiton are GREAT. DA2 is eeeeeeeh....
[3:16:21] <ALTRNico> recycled maps btw
[3:16:23] <+prime_name> Inquisition is the second best
[3:16:24] <$Shotred> Woolie needs.to get into Jade Empire
[3:16:25] <snakemuho> DA2 Sarcastic Hawke is the greatest
[3:16:26] <%augurgewalt> @GarbageNirvana 2 had like 8 months of devtime
[3:16:27] <+kyh9> Dragon Age 2 is just a western Yakuza game
[3:16:28] <%BioHunter> I liked 2 waaaayyy better than inquisition
[3:16:28] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> DAO is incredible. Inquisition is good, but has alot of problems
[3:16:28] <%tattleworm> da2 was another "make this game in a year" game which explains a lot
[3:16:28] <Chatterbox1991> Inquisition is a massive overall improvment
[3:16:28] <RoboticRexkek> segbas2004 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Hi Woolie! Keep on keeping on. The SW LP is great. I love catching your stream live, keep the good work!
[3:16:30] <+FrenchTact1cs> 2 has great character moments at least
[3:16:34] <StarlitStunner> 2 was done in like 18 months I think
[3:16:36] <+Neale2theMusic> mass effect yo
[3:16:36] <+taggerung403> DA2 is the legend of Korra to DAO legend of aang
[3:16:38] <lotharrio> Jade Empire is basically Woolie-bait.
[3:16:38] <GarbageNirvana> @augurgewalt Well that explains it
[3:16:42] <OBS_VinnieK> Honestly I think one day Woolie should fully experience a fully modded/tricked out Skyrim
[3:16:44] <+Ixek> Origins is greatest easily, 2 isn't that great but it has some value, then each following title also follows the route of 2 being "not great, but has something at least".
[3:16:47] <CastellanVon> I like 2’s characters more overall
[3:16:47] <stratfel112> I barely remember what happened in DA2
[3:16:48] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus it's both
[3:16:49] <%JJCheeker> I like Jade empire
[3:16:50] <%DatAsuna> like dark souls
[3:16:50] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Dragon Age 2 was just a prequel to Inquisition. It's only true contribution to the franchise is fleshing out the Qunari
[3:16:50] <Iwashi94> DA isn't that traditional tbf
[3:16:55] <$Shotred> lothario I agree
[3:16:59] <mihokspawn> @jetjagger222 Kasavir
[3:17:01] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie skipped Dark Souls because of this
[3:17:02] <%DatAsuna> DA is tolkein but horny
[3:17:04] <%derap41> Its Tolkien but with better characters
[3:17:07] <heartlesshealer> big horny
[3:17:07] <+prime_name> Theres some fun stuff to set it apart.
[3:17:09] <lotharrio> It's Tolkien with a... sort of cosmic horror deep underground, bubbling up.
[3:17:10] <siamzero94> There are some twists
[3:17:11] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Inquisition was a decent game outside of some of the companions
[3:17:12] <+kyh9> Dragon Age ORigins is literally just Tolkien
[3:17:13] <%derap41> There are gay people in it that's not very Tolkiebn
[3:17:14] <MidnightBurst12> Jade Empire would be a great choice
[3:17:16] <DSD24> @DatAsuna That's a good descriptor
[3:17:19] <%DatAsuna> Woolie would love the qunari
[3:17:21] <+jetjagger222> @mihokspawn i completely forgot about him. so boring
[3:17:29] <+kyh9> DAO is just Tolkien.
[3:17:30] <%augurgewalt> EA trying to sell DA as "super edgy fantasy" mad emy cringe though
[3:17:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Jade Empire!
[3:17:34] <+FrenchTact1cs> Woolie Vs ALPHA PROTOCOL
[3:17:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> Tolkien is a bit...easy to distract in book form
[3:17:40] <%JJCheeker> Nathan Fillion is in Jade empire
[3:17:43] <lotharrio> Dragon Age: Origins is basically a redo of KOTOR, but in fantasy setting.
[3:17:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> ALPHA PROTOCOL IS GODLIKE
[3:17:48] <%DatAsuna> Do try jade empire
[3:17:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> HECK FOR LIFE
[3:17:52] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Everything with magic and demons is different enough for me.
[3:17:52] <StarlitStunner> ALPHA PROTOCOL
[3:17:54] <+kyh9> @FrenchTact1cs Oh god, I can't even imagine how he'd handle that
[3:17:56] <snakemuho> just install faster sprint mod to cut down the game by 30% Keepo
[3:17:57] <%VCRUZZO> yeah, thats true
[3:17:57] <reven229> This is woolie's favorite game on the citadel
[3:18:01] <T_Sasquatch> Knife eared fucks
[3:18:04] <DXLelouch24> Dragon Age has Blood Mage tho
[3:18:05] <mihokspawn> @jetjagger222 NWN2 you gotta dig deep for fun characters... Or just play Mask of the Betrayer
[3:18:10] <%VCRUZZO> except for the qunari at first
[3:18:16] <+kyh9> @DXLelouch24 Blood magic is just the dark side
[3:18:16] <+Bluemanzee> Dragon Age has Dwarves without beards DansGame
[3:18:17] <Pistachius> Jade Empire kaotykUP jnbGasm
[3:18:20] <lotharrio> Dragon Age is good for shitting on elves constantly. Fuck those knife-ears.
[3:18:24] <fuji_92> Qunari tho
[3:18:26] <%MrMoonGoose> @mihokspawn or play an online server
[3:18:31] <andrei11dr> So the "Dark Souls is generic nights" problem @woolieversus
[3:18:32] <%augurgewalt> NWN2 is actually amazing writing wise, even the OC, but I would not tell anyone to play it ever
[3:18:34] <%tattleworm> they do cool shit with the generic archetypes. dwarves are basically an auto-immune system.
[3:18:34] <DXLelouch24> no its more busted than the dark side
[3:18:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You need to play more than once a week
[3:18:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:18:42] <DocMadfox> I'd love to see Woolie play Mass Effect 1 - 3
[3:18:44] <+taggerung403> DA2 has best girl Avelline
[3:18:45] <%MrMoonGoose> NWN servers still going from 2008
[3:18:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> Dragon Age Origin is the only fantasy setting that truly captivated me with no fall off at any point
[3:18:48] <+prime_name> #FE
[3:18:51] <$Shotred> I hate dragon age 3, especially since you don't use heal magic
[3:18:53] <mihokspawn> @MrMoonGoose and miss that Obsidian wrting?
[3:19:02] <zenith0111> I do not care about Dragon Age.
[3:19:03] <%DatAsuna> Some games need full streams but edited LPs
[3:19:04] <fuji_92> No #FE here
[3:19:04] <lotharrio> Oh shit, it's out tomorrow!
[3:19:05] <Zebroneath> Mostly games with a lot of downtime where very little happens.
[3:19:09] <snakemuho> TOMORROW OH SHIT
[3:19:09] <StarlitStunner> Qunari are nine feet tall muscled metal skinned tieflings. stripGo
[3:19:11] <%SeruraRenge> @kyh9 It's not though, the problem is Andraste's people have hunted them down so much that these days the only people left to learn blood magic from is a demon or an abomination. Or someone from the Imperium
[3:19:12] <Prevot> so woolie vs will never have its own TMS?
[3:19:12] <+sherndon226> Dragon Age 3 is my favorite one.
[3:19:17] <andrei11dr> So no New Vegas for a while LUL
[3:19:21] <%MrMoonGoose> @mihokspawn tru, but the community makes some dope shit tho
[3:19:22] <T_Sasquatch> Tomorrow!!!?
[3:19:23] <+Estuko> lol
[3:19:28] <%DatAsuna> How big is his dick tho?
[3:19:29] <hero1151> FALLOUT NEW VEGAS ALREADY
[3:19:30] <%JJCheeker> Dragon Age 3 romance options suck
[3:19:32] <+sherndon226> And the last good Bioware game
[3:19:36] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> So Baldur’s Gate Series LP when?
[3:19:42] <+sherndon226> Cassandra is the best
[3:19:42] <$Shotred> I agree New Vegas should be first
[3:19:44] <zenith0111> @andrei11dr Fallout is a game series that can last forever LUL
[3:19:49] <%OldManJEWc> Shadowrun: Dragonfall Directors Cut?
[3:19:55] <%alpacasintophats> woolieGASM_SG
[3:19:55] <+taggerung403> Its a crime you cant properly romance the dwarf scout in DA3
[3:19:59] <%netrac> Death Stranding is like the definition of LP Poison
[3:20:03] <lotharrio> Dragon Age Inquisition telling me about the Empire is the only one that made me think that Mages shouldn't be left to do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[3:20:05] <%AWKWARDL0SER> Love your metal covers duder, Woolie yours a cromulent MC
[3:20:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHENS NUNS 69

[3:20:58] <%DatAsuna> Only old canon applies to kotor discussion
[3:21:01] <zenith0111> @netrac It's definitely an engaging game but only if you're playing. But watching is just like.... "What am i doing with my life" You know

[3:21:23] <%CyanDeadEye> Bane was voiced by Mark Hamill
[3:21:24] <%augurgewalt> new EU is just "some stuff from old EU rehashed, but somehow worse"
[3:21:26] <+Bluemanzee> Disney can suck my nut
[3:21:35] <+FrenchTact1cs> fking disney canon
[3:21:41] <%DatAsuna> A different kotor is canon
[3:21:43] <%AWKWARDL0SER> Think we’ll ever get console SWtoR?
[3:21:46] <%VCRUZZO> its all before bane though
[3:21:46] <siamzero94> BUT NO ONE ELSE
[3:21:48] <%JJCheeker> They wanna use the name only to make money with bastardized versions of of those character
[3:21:56] <+sherndon226> Star Wars canon is all fucked
[3:21:58] <notenoughgirls> new bane was added in clone wars
[3:21:59] <$Shotred> yep
[3:22:10] <T_Sasquatch> Star Wars is fucked in general
[3:22:11] <%augurgewalt> the real way is to become a Warhammer fan isntead
[3:22:12] <+sherndon226> mass fucking shadow lol
[3:22:12] <+Estuko> LUL

[3:22:20] <%VCRUZZO> die
[3:22:20] <%DatAsuna> It's not complicated
[3:22:21] <%VCRUZZO> ?
[3:22:22] <zenith0111> Who cares about "canon" in a choose your own adventure video game?
[3:22:25] <olaksi> it's space magic
[3:22:29] <theKingRamses> why didn't it work in rogue one
[3:22:31] <%netrac> @zenith0111 Yeah I'm not shitting on the game it's just like you can have like 2-3 episodes of NOTHING
[3:22:33] <+wintrysoma> it's their fault for making the audience question it
[3:22:36] <%DatAsuna> it happened in EU but it failed
[3:22:36] <+FrenchTact1cs> My jaw dropped. Best part of the film
[3:22:38] <+Estuko> It looked really fucking cool though lmao
[3:22:38] <+CaptainJax> nobody did it because it breaks everything
[3:22:39] <+sherndon226> remember storm trooper zombies
[3:22:48] <+chiluzza> no one did it in EU
[3:22:51] <+Estuko> @sherndon226 the death troopers book?
[3:22:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @hero1151
[3:22:54] <+VoidBastid> yeah it was cool when Rogue One did it because it made sense enough
[3:22:57] <%AWKWARDL0SER> Sci-Fi logic knead not make cents
[3:22:58] <zenith0111> @netrac Yeah it's pretty tragic
[3:23:00] <siamzero94> YES
[3:23:01] <+CaptainJax> YES
[3:23:06] <%DatAsuna> @chiluzza in EU the SSD tanked 3 lightspeed rams
[3:23:06] <stratfel112> I didn't like darth sion in kotor 2 i thought he was a chump despite his cool design, he let's you escape all the time and gets beaten by everyone
[3:23:06] <hellkhat> tes
[3:23:10] <%derap41> Why aren't there Light speed torpedoes
[3:23:11] <muniea3> oh man remember when the Death Star was easily destroyed?
[3:23:11] <hellkhat> which is why
[3:23:12] <%CyanDeadEye> They used a hammerhead to push the "edge" of a Star Destroyer and decapitate another Star Destroyer.
[3:23:12] <heartlesshealer> FLEET OF PLANET CRACKERS
[3:23:12] <+SarcFa> That's the issue with the kamikaze
[3:23:12] <fuji_92> YES
[3:23:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just build missiles based on this premise
[3:23:14] <+kyh9> Why not just make light-speed misisles?
[3:23:14] <hellkhat> its dumb
[3:23:16] <%SeruraRenge> Except in A New Hope Han specifically says if you hyperspace into something you just spat
[3:23:16] <$Shotred> @augurgewalt True there is some interesting concepts but where is the magic and laser swords
[3:23:16] <KeiPrime> not worth the resources to do it right?
[3:23:16] <notenoughgirls> admittedly im pretty sure those hammerhead ships appear in rebels first as shout out to kotor
[3:23:16] <siamzero94> THAT'S WHY IT'S STUPID!
[3:23:20] <Prevot> why wouldn't everyone be doing that then
[3:23:21] <+CaptainJax> Just slap that shit on a bigass rock
[3:23:22] <T_Sasquatch> Just use droids to do the kamikaze shit
[3:23:36] <%DatAsuna> Also I'm not explaining the physics, I'm explaining the magic system.
[3:23:38] <%derap41> WRONG
[3:23:38] <lotharrio> Rebellion-era X Wings all have hyperspace drives. So they should be able to kamikaze through anything. Just have R2s pilot them into the Death Star.
[3:23:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> That kamikaze attack is one of the reason why I like Mass Effect's Mass Relay approach more than just being able to freely jump
[3:23:41] <reven229> Most ships use AI, which will do their best to NOT do that. It's why it takes a few seconds to plot a course
[3:23:44] <hellkhat> fuck even wasting droids just auto pilot lol
[3:23:45] <%augurgewalt> @Shotred do you not like chainsaw swords? also magic sounds dangerously like CHAOS
[3:23:46] <%netrac> I really don't like the force
[3:23:47] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Wasn’t there a comic where a Star Destroyer jumps into a bunch of TIEs?
[3:23:47] <%derap41> Momentum and speed is relative
[3:23:49] <rumuloh> Just put hypersapce on a chunk of metal and put a droid in it, just build a million of those and who needs death stars
[3:23:51] <heartlesshealer> would it depend on if the planet has an atmosphere to mess up?
[3:23:53] <+kyh9> In physics, that's relative. They're not 'moving'
[3:23:53] <GarbageNirvana> Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space!
[3:23:59] <+charmquarke> at that point, do you even need a death star
[3:23:59] <hero1151> light speed WHALES
[3:24:01] <DocMadfox> This is why people hated that
[3:24:02] <siamzero94> Our planet got fucked up by a 10km long asteroid before
[3:24:02] <+CaptainJax> RIP Death Star
[3:24:03] <+FrenchTact1cs> thats expensive
[3:24:03] <The_Grand_J> ye cause v^2
[3:24:06] <%netrac> ONE IN A MILLION THO
[3:24:07] <theKingRamses> several ships in rogue one bounced off a big ship at the end of rogue one
[3:24:13] <Jathspuh> @derap41 you must be fun a t parties Kappa
[3:24:13] <muniea3> this discovery would be the end of star WARS
[3:24:24] <+chiluzza> Bridge
[3:24:24] <DocMadfox> Bridge
[3:24:25] <%CyanDeadEye> Bridge
[3:24:26] <akman14> This recruits is a 20 kilo ferrous slug , feel the weight!
[3:24:29] <%VCRUZZO> YEAH, that happens to the bridge
[3:24:29] <KeiPrime> the bridge AFTEr they lose shields
[3:24:32] <zenith0111> I loved that moment
[3:24:34] <MillaMoks> F=MA. Doesnt matter if the mass is small, when accel is so damn huge. Fighter would be fine, no need for cruisers.
[3:24:35] <siamzero94> Now imagine the Chixulub asteroid travelling at light speed. Earth would've been broken in half
[3:24:39] <+sherndon226> bridge and the ship crashes into the death star
[3:24:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> tskj katrjATJKbTEAn Szdn Azsxhm zayfnTHEngzm xzth E
[3:24:44] <+NiSoKr> They hand waved it in ROS
[3:24:44] <+CaptainJax> Just slap a hyperdrive on a big rock there's no counyer
[3:24:45] <heartlesshealer> TIME TO LEARN
[3:24:45] <+Dustwalker44> The would cost so much money though!
[3:24:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> gretyhanrERzasxhmduskzyaEMZxjdyj,mjWRtAMZSTMJTHaYZHMRSXTJ
[3:24:49] <olaksi> IT IS STUPID
[3:24:50] <%netrac> E=m*v^2
[3:24:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:24:52] <+NiSoKr> They said it's a one in a million
[3:24:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[3:24:53] <%derap41> Shields probably
[3:24:54] <+Dustwalker44> that would cost^
[3:24:55] <hntronium> That's because it is stupid
[3:24:57] <T_Sasquatch> Scienceeeee
[3:25:05] <stratfel112> The rise of skywalker said the holdo maneuver was a one in a million shot, holdo reprimanded poe for his plan based on bad odds.
[3:25:07] <zenith0111> ACTIVATE V TRIGGER
[3:25:08] <shutupandjam3465> is the stream ending now?
[3:25:10] <The_Grand_J> @MillaMoks but enegy has a v^2
[3:25:16] <The_Grand_J> so ye
[3:25:19] <$Shotred> @augurgewalt Yeah those chaos fleash things are interesting
[3:25:21] <The_Grand_J> big boom
[3:25:23] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> What
[3:25:26] <%JJCheeker> They are going to stop for a bit but streaming later
[3:25:32] <%DatAsuna> It's an RPG joke
[3:25:33] <%alpacasintophats> syntax is key
[3:25:33] <%AWKWARDL0SER> Did you know Palpatine wasn’t even head of the Sith until the end of Episode 1, I thought Darth Pelagius was long dead by the movies
[3:25:33] <T_Sasquatch> English :thinking:
[3:25:34] <siamzero94> One in million, my ass
[3:25:34] <%JJCheeker> They gotta eat food
[3:25:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Kreia's lesson is about stealing XP by doing sidequests
[3:25:53] <%augurgewalt> Kreia's philosophy is basically that you're stealing XP from NPCs
[3:25:53] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:25:54] <olaksi> Like kill stealing but with EXP
[3:26:00] <%DatAsuna> It's about kreia's social darwinism
[3:26:04] <DocMadfox> You're stealing XP from people by doing their sidequests
[3:26:04] <+CaptainJax> I guess they're saying you're taking away their XP by doing shit for them?
[3:26:04] <+BionoidLCR> azuna you gota learn to type better LUL
[3:26:10] <%Irridium> you steal their xp basically
[3:26:12] <heartlesshealer> Kreia is telling you to XP steal
[3:26:14] <TDAWS_MP132> words
[3:26:14] <shutupandjam3465> so theyre taking a 30 minute to an hour break then going to keep playing?
[3:26:19] <%DatAsuna> tl;dr it's also a video game joke
[3:26:28] <%DatAsuna> Donations have hard character limits lol
[3:26:38] <zenith0111> Delayed commentary caleb3Head
[3:26:39] <lotharrio> @shutupandjam3465 They're probably gonna get food at some point, but yeah.
[3:26:43] <andrei11dr> I think they are taking about Kreia
[3:26:45] <stratfel112> some guy in the end of the rise of skywalker did the holdo manuever above endor
[3:26:46] <%derap41> Star Wars space battle makes no sense anyway
[3:26:51] <%DatAsuna> Can only use so many letters
[3:26:53] <%alpacasintophats> woolieGASM_SG woolieGASM_SG woolieGASM_SG woolieGASM_SG woolieGASM_SG
[3:26:53] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> You take the exp the npc would have gotten from the sidequest
[3:26:56] <%Irridium> why didn't the seperatists just have their droids fly into the republic ships
[3:26:59] <T_Sasquatch> Are you SUREEEE
[3:27:00] <%Irridium> in the clone wars
[3:27:00] <theKingRamses> couldn't you?
[3:27:00] <cerass> !uptime
[3:27:01] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 38 minutes
[3:27:01] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> Even so, that was stupid
[3:27:01] <olaksi> Why not though
[3:27:01] <hellkhat> yes
[3:27:01] <%TRILLTURBAN> why not?
[3:27:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> CAN'T YOU?!
[3:27:03] <DocMadfox> You can with a big enough ship
[3:27:05] <%derap41> Woolie you totally could
[3:27:06] <%VCRUZZO> you could do it to a city
[3:27:08] <The_Grand_J> are you sure
[3:27:08] <hero1151> who cares there are light speed WHALES
[3:27:10] <shutupandjam3465> ah ok any idea when the stream is gonna start again?
[3:27:11] <rumuloh> Yeah you could
[3:27:13] <prince_johnny_> True
[3:27:14] <fuji_92> Cant you tho?
[3:27:16] <cerass> dang
[3:27:16] <zenith0111> True
[3:27:17] <a_mad_dragon> you just need to put hyperspace engines on asteroids and aim them at the planet
[3:27:18] <siamzero94> Slap a hyperdrive on an asteroid, done
[3:27:19] <T_Sasquatch> Midichlorians
[3:27:19] <reven229> Yeah, but the Vong
[3:27:19] <Redblood801> Star Wars tech is just magic
[3:27:19] <+CaptainJax> I dunno the ship in TLJ was fuckin BIG
[3:27:20] <akman14> That's not an excuse for anything
[3:27:20] <lemon_lore> gundam?
[3:27:21] <%DatAsuna> Star trek is all fake science too
[3:27:21] <$Shotred> it wasnt a kid show
[3:27:21] <%ChoculaUltra> oh no, V Mills just angered all the star wars boomers.
[3:27:23] <notenoughgirls> to be specific the supremacy's width is 1/3 the death star's diameter
[3:27:23] <%augurgewalt> Star Wars isn't even SciFi, it's SciFantasy
[3:27:24] <fuji_92> True
[3:27:26] <%TRILLTURBAN> Shandification applies here too, kinda
[3:27:27] <%netrac> Use lead lightspeed kamikazes
[3:27:27] <+chiluzza> what you dont want to watch the enterprise do a surf on a bunch of ships?
[3:27:28] <olaksi> space. magic.
[3:27:31] <andrei11dr> Didn't Death Star got shields?
[3:27:32] <%RioGascar> and thats what kotor is doing but it opens up risks
[3:27:33] <lotharrio> Star Wars was made because Lucas couldn't get the rights to Flash Gordon.
[3:27:34] <+charmquarke> and definitely do not watch the animated Star trek show on Nickelodeon, it looks like hot garbage
[3:27:36] <arkv01> harry potter in space?
[3:27:37] <rumuloh> Star Trek is just as bad, they just say tech words
[3:27:40] <+FrenchTact1cs> Its does. Love sucks
[3:27:40] <%DatAsuna> Star trek/starate .etc aren't realscience either
[3:27:41] <heartlesshealer> because the dark side is passion and love is passion
[3:27:42] <lotharrio> Flash. Fucking. Gordon.
[3:27:43] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> LOVE IS EVIL
[3:27:43] <+jiggy_snipe> emotions are bad Kappa
[3:27:45] <+glgzephyr> wait so I dipped out for like 10 minutes. are we just shooting the shit until we resume?
[3:27:48] <rubbishbinge> The dark side is the sharingan
[3:27:50] <DocMadfox> That is NOT how that works
[3:27:50] <%JJCheeker> It was made for everyone though not just kids
[3:27:51] <hntronium> Sounds like a sorry excuse for critical thought
[3:27:51] <+therabbles> with enough speed anything is possible
[3:27:52] <siamzero94> Speed gives a lot of energy
[3:27:54] <+sherndon226> yeah it could totally mess up a planet. an asteroid doesnt go nearly as fast as light speed and can kill planets
[3:27:56] <%VCRUZZO> star trek tries to be science, and fails plenty
[3:27:57] <andrei11dr> Wach DS9
[3:27:59] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Science: Star Trek Magic: Star Wars
[3:28:05] <%VCRUZZO> what of mass though
[3:28:07] <+CaptainJax> INFINITE mass
[3:28:07] <StarlitStunner> Star Trek is just dumb magic though. The science is whatever they say even more than Star Wars.
[3:28:08] <hntronium> It would ruin its atmosphere
[3:28:09] <DocMadfox> "Bullets need to be big to hurt people" -Woolie's logic
[3:28:11] <theKingRamses> it's just a bunch of concentrated comets
[3:28:12] <T_Sasquatch> Yeaaaaaa
[3:28:15] <user_naim> It’s like those kinetic orbital strikes
[3:28:15] <%mistspade> mistspade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! weee
[3:28:16] <+FrenchTact1cs> Also it eats suns
[3:28:16] <stratfel112> I just want star wars to be consistent to it's own rules
[3:28:16] <%derap41> Woolie hit anything at light speed and you'll destroy it it doesn't matter how big it is
[3:28:18] <zenith0111> Star Trek is more about morel dilemmas then science
[3:28:18] <$Shotred> lol like no one never killed nobody out of love
[3:28:19] <%AWKWARDL0SER> Lost, XFiles, Star Wars etc need not be explained
[3:28:20] <lotharrio> Force is equal to mass times acceleration. You approach infinite mass as you approach light speed.
[3:28:24] <%netrac> You could break a planet with a relativistic baseball
[3:28:25] <%DatAsuna> Also make all those star destroyer slook just like the old ones
[3:28:26] <The_Grand_J> energy is affected more by speed than mass
[3:28:27] <+therabbles> the downforce
[3:28:31] <T_Sasquatch> Make the whole planet a death star
[3:28:31] <%VCRUZZO> goddamnit
[3:28:31] <+sherndon226> just make it eat the sun of a solar system and thats all it needs to do
[3:28:34] <+glgzephyr> it's really soft sci-fi
[3:28:35] <zenith0111> The science just propels them into the realm of ethics
[3:28:36] <%JJCheeker> I really dislike that the "'it's for kids" argument
[3:28:37] <Pistachius> EVOL TheIlluminati
[3:28:41] <+Bluemanzee> Star Trek is more about characters than technology I think. Old/good trek at least
[3:28:43] <shutupandjam3465> star trek is still a lot more thought out and way less fantas =y than star wars though
[3:28:43] <powerprotoman> ultimately the handmaiden is woolie bait and thats what counts
[3:28:43] <%DatAsuna> Now that's a name
[3:28:43] <%RioGascar> We need to use no science
[3:28:44] <%augurgewalt> "A Wizard did it"
[3:28:44] <notenoughgirls> starkiller base is smaller than the dwarf planet ceres and knowing this is driving me to insanity
[3:28:47] <Camail> thats the worst take
[3:28:47] <PJawesome583> look people star wars is fun cause its a bunch of vague cliches with cool lazer swords with a bunch of hookey mystasium and its just fun
[3:28:49] <%DatAsuna> Flemeth is kreia
[3:28:49] <%gatorafan> Star wars is Fantasy... Star Online. Kappa
[3:28:51] <%DatAsuna> not morrigan
[3:28:51] <+prime_name> She's kinda not.
[3:28:52] <DocMadfox> "It's for kids so it's okay it's dumb" is the WORST fucking argument.
[3:28:52] <heartlesshealer> =T
[3:28:53] <DSD24> Morrigan's not like that
[3:28:55] <StarlitStunner> Wally West fastest man alive
[3:28:56] <%AWKWARDL0SER> NDT has put him self waaaay over by nitpicking Sci movies much to my chagrin
[3:28:57] <Halospaz117> She is hot tho
[3:28:58] <rumuloh> "Just turn your brain off, it's for kids!"
[3:28:59] <%ChoculaUltra> the hilarity of the novelization of the Rise of Skywalker only adds to it's long, long list of baffling missteps
[3:29:01] <gamewarden92> Kreia is way hotter.
[3:29:01] <Zayasu> morrigan Kreygasm
[3:29:01] <%netrac> E=.5*M*V^2
[3:29:02] <arkv01> yeah I dunno, krea is kinda curvy
[3:29:02] <%augurgewalt> Actually Kreia is hotter
[3:29:03] <snakemuho> Morrigan is for cuddles
[3:29:04] <ALTRNico> Morrigan is less fuckable
[3:29:05] <+sherndon226> she's really not morrigan is just a jerk
[3:29:05] <fuji_92> Flemeth is kreia
[3:29:08] <%VCRUZZO> they are very different characters with way different motives
[3:29:09] <+SarcFa> Morrigan's nothing like Kreia at all
[3:29:10] <hero1151> swooping is bad
[3:29:10] <DSD24> All girls named Morrigan are hot
[3:29:10] <heartlesshealer> Have a good break
[3:29:12] <+glgzephyr> oh so now we're breaking got it
[3:29:14] <dorpork> morrigan is just a rehash from viconia from bldurs gate 2
[3:29:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Kreia's lesson is basically "You're stealing XP by doong sidequests. These NPC's could be leveling up."
[3:29:22] <+jetjagger222> kreia's pretty attractive for an elderly woman
[3:29:22] <heartlesshealer> ^^^^^^^
[3:29:22] <GarbageNirvana> It's not-breakfast
[3:29:24] <dorpork> flemeth is like a failed attempt at doing kreia
[3:29:25] <%DatAsuna> Do people jus confuse flemeth and morrigan?
[3:29:26] <TomFrancis_> psaHoldon woolieGASM
[3:29:27] <+glgzephyr> 2 hour break?
[3:29:27] <lotharrio> Flemeth is Bioware trying to write Kreia.
[3:29:28] <siamzero94> Bon Appétit!
[3:29:29] <rumuloh> I'd fuck Kreia
[3:29:37] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> otzHi
[3:29:38] <%JJCheeker> Enjoy your break
[3:29:39] <%Superspider51> I know they mean DA Morrigan but I can't not picture Darkstalkers Morrigan talking philosophy
[3:29:40] <%gatorafan> 2 hour break boys woolieCHAN
[3:29:42] <%alpacasintophats> get some good eats guys. see ya later
[3:29:42] <mrjplays2k9> I missed demo?
[3:29:43] <%augurgewalt> Bioware rehashing party members was honestly one of their worst habits
[3:29:45] <RoboticRexkek> 2hrs yes
[3:29:45] <GarbageNirvana> pog
[3:29:48] <T_Sasquatch> Time watch the vod PogChamp
[3:29:49] <siamzero94> Make it three
[3:29:49] <+glgzephyr> quick trip to buy a lightsaber
[3:29:50] <zenith0111> @docmadfox Yeah that argument basically boils down to "I liked it and that's all that matters"
[3:29:50] <%VCRUZZO> @DatAsuna I hope no makes that mistake
[3:29:50] <%DatAsuna> but what colour?
[3:29:54] <andrei11dr> but Kreia got that GILF quality
[3:29:55] <%peanutbutteroven> See ya in a bit guys
[3:29:55] <%MeatBomb> I'll be waiting!
[3:29:56] <+s0ki_> you know how bullets work? imagin a bullet goin at % of light speed?
