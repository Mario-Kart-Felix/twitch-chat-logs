[0:02:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah boi!!!!
[0:02:17] <%Terrarp> Is it Maneater time?
[0:02:20] <VoraciousKain> no
[0:02:23] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Time for Boss weapons:D
[0:02:28] <%Amaideus> He's gonna get fisted
[0:02:28] <%krispen_wa> RISE, IF YOU WOULD
[0:02:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Where we droppin boys?
[0:02:31] <VoraciousKain> its time for crab
[0:02:32] <%krispen_wa> FOR THAT IS OUR CURSE
[0:02:33] <GeoffGeofreed> It's time Bois!
[0:02:40] <BenLubar> has woolie said "drop your shield" yet
[0:02:41] <%Amaideus> I hate Dragon God btw
[0:02:41] <Thepothero> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:02:48] <%Amaideus> I think it's almost on par with BoC
[0:02:53] <%Terrarp> Time for Dragon then
[0:02:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> prolly Dragon God time ngl
[0:03:03] <%krispen_wa> Dragon God doesnt have dumb RNG though
[0:03:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @amaideus yeah they're both shitty gimmick bosses
[0:03:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> let's goo it up with eleven
[0:03:15] <Thepothero> We doi it doodOne lvndmaClapped
[0:03:15] <VoraciousKain> dragon is way better
[0:03:18] <%Amaideus> Dragon God definitely isn't AS bad
[0:03:27] <%Amaideus> Because BoC is one of the worst bosses I've ever seen ever
[0:03:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> BoC?
[0:03:37] <%Amaideus> But I don't like the fight
[0:03:41] <%Amaideus> Bed Of Chaos
[0:03:44] <GeoffGeofreed> I really wish Dragon God wasn't this gimmick non boss. Such a waste
[0:03:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck the bed if chaos
[0:03:52] <VoraciousKain> not as bad as orstein and slough, what an awful boss
[0:03:54] <%Wouldz> yes let's go!
[0:03:57] <%Amaideus> That's correct @CaptainPileDriver
[0:03:59] <%krispen_wa> all my homies hate Bed of Chaos
[0:04:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> the BoC is actually the shittiest boss fight in all of souls. like fuck.
[0:04:20] <%Terrarp> I personally hate Maneater with passion, almost quit the whole game because of it back in the PS3
[0:04:20] <%krispen_wa> Original Astraea's theme is so good
[0:04:21] <%dreadedcthulhu> dreadedcthulhu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! reggie sooouuuls
[0:04:23] <%Amaideus> Have any of you ever seen anyone play through BoC and go "yeah that was alright"?
[0:04:23] <+Grayhammatter> fuck bed of chaos
[0:04:28] <+gag5y> YOOOO
[0:04:35] <SuperBadAtGames> 2 raiders from SuperBadAtGames have joined! 
[0:04:37] <%Amaideus> I've watched probably close to 100 playthroughs and NEVER seen it
[0:04:38] <@Solidus_113> Big SFV news today
[0:04:42] <VoraciousKain> no one took the bait sad hours
[0:04:43] <%krispen_wa> 2 RAIDERA PogChamp
[0:04:52] <%krispen_wa> *RAIDERS
[0:04:57] <%Amaideus> You have to do it with a "worse" boss
[0:04:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> I love being pushed into a pit for blocking, and not blocking and being hit by a hitbox that lies about where it is
[0:04:59] <SivSarcast> Funny that, I reached the Smouldering Lake in DS3 yesterday. Who put a goddamn BALLISTA there, though?
[0:05:00] <%Amaideus> Like Gwyndolin
[0:05:03] <%emperordread> Go Go #TeamReggarth woolieKICKDAD
[0:05:04] <%Amaideus> Or Artorias
[0:05:08] <%Amaideus> Or Kalameet
[0:05:09] <%Wouldz> @terrarp maneater was the hardest for me (a first timer) for sure
[0:05:11] <+Grayhammatter> ey, welcome raiders
[0:05:18] <+TheotherKristian> Let's'a fucking go!
[0:05:24] <SuperBadAtGames> Woolie time!!!!
[0:05:25] <VoraciousKain> Maneater made me stop for a whole month
[0:05:30] <%Amaideus> I bet Seath would've worked too
[0:05:30] <+MisleadingEchoes> V SWITCH WOOLIE
[0:05:35] <VoraciousKain> I cheesed lurker
[0:05:39] <%krispen_wa> Maneater ate my firstborn
[0:05:41] <Hyphixsys> YEYEYE
[0:05:52] <SuperBadAtGames> I did a smol raid from my channel, hope some friends enjoy Woolie's stream :D <3
[0:05:59] <+TheotherKristian> Maneater killed my momma
[0:06:00] <Applecannon63> Man Guilty Gear is nuts
[0:06:03] <BenLubar> does the music sound discordant for anyone else or is twitch messing with my audio again
[0:06:03] <mortificent> heyoo
[0:06:09] <GeoffGeofreed> Reggarth The Backstabber will be Clappin dem Dargon cheeks
[0:06:10] <derap41> ye ye ye
[0:06:12] <VoraciousKain> Maneater increased my annual taxes
[0:06:14] <%krispen_wa> nah thats just Astraea's theme
[0:06:20] <BenLubar> like the kind of audio you'd get on a slightly damaged vhs tape
[0:06:34] <mortificent> have y'all seen the SFV stream? Dan is looking real good
[0:06:43] <%Amaideus> Sound's fine for me
[0:06:52] <VoraciousKain> sounds fine 2
[0:06:57] <%dreadedcthulhu> I want to play giovanna why no pc beta ibdwLost ibdwLost ibdwLost
[0:07:03] <BenLubar> yep, looks like it's on my end again
[0:07:20] <+Grayhammatter> wonder what they'll be going to first this time
[0:07:29] <VoraciousKain> shrine of storms
[0:07:33] <%Amaideus> Dragon God
[0:07:36] <GeoffGeofreed> I wish PC would get a Guilty Gear Strive beta sometime after
[0:07:55] <%Amaideus> My bet is Dragon God > 1-3, then Woolie will go "nah don't do 1-4 yet"
[0:08:00] <%Amaideus> Then off to 5-2
[0:08:04] <Nikbottom> Hello, I would like to see Reggie play Demon's Souls
[0:08:12] <VoraciousKain> same, in time
[0:08:17] <BenLubar> @Nikbottom I have some good news for you
[0:08:19] <%notsoy> Sir Reggarth of Rollington
[0:08:19] <VoraciousKain> hes getting snacks
[0:08:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> So BoC is the worst fight in ds1 easily, is it the worst fight in the dark souls series?
[0:08:22] <%krispen_wa> you will see reggie play demon souls
[0:08:24] <%notsoy> no longer the Backstabber
[0:08:33] <VoraciousKain> gotta fuel up his gamer mode
[0:08:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:08:34] <mortificent> Reggie?? we only know Reggarth here
[0:08:35] <%krispen_wa> yes it is the worst fight ever
[0:08:44] <Applecannon63> honestly GG PC beta would probably not happen but definitely a pc port of the final game
[0:08:53] <%krispen_wa> some of the defiled bosses in bloodborne are second worst tho
[0:08:57] <SivSarcast> @CaptainPileDriver It's a puzzle boss, so the jumps are more annoying than the boss itself.
[0:09:11] <+Grayhammatter> sir reggarth of backstabaria
[0:09:13] <%krispen_wa> defiled pthumerian descendant *shivers*
[0:09:17] <Sodium_Chloride09> V-Shift woolie. V-SHIFT WOOLIE
[0:09:27] <+DragonArt07> what music is this?
[0:09:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> @sivsarcast and being pushed into pits for blocking and getting hit by a hitbox that's bigger than it seems
[0:09:30] <VoraciousKain> the worst boss is the path to king allant
[0:09:35] <GeoffGeofreed> I wonder what if my laptop can play Guilty Gear Strive. Hope it can though
[0:09:35] <@Solidus_113> V-Shift into super
[0:09:54] <mortificent> V-Shift looked pretty hype, ngl
[0:10:00] <VoraciousKain> oh wait, ancient dragons from ds2 is also awful
[0:10:09] <VoraciousKain> but then again so are many in ds2
[0:10:16] <%ggbhtg> @Solidus_113 that is a thing, Nash did it to Guile (for those that didn't see it)
[0:10:18] <Equirah> god damnit i forgot, i was about to go shower
[0:10:20] <%krispen_wa> little V can shift?
[0:10:22] <+DragonArt07> anyone know where this music is from?
[0:10:28] <%krispen_wa> this game
[0:10:31] <%krispen_wa> astraea theme
[0:10:39] <+DragonArt07> cool thanks
[0:10:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> the original game
[0:10:42] <%Amaideus> Original DeS
[0:10:43] <VoraciousKain> its maiden astreas theme
[0:10:44] <%Amaideus> Not the remake
[0:10:56] <DatAsuna> loop
[0:10:57] <@Solidus_113> wake up V-Shift, your opponent V-Shift's your V-Shift, you V-Shift their V-Shift into super
[0:10:58] <Applecannon63> wait so they're reintroducing special to super canceling?
[0:11:07] <%ggbhtg> Every video that has blue lights, that's actually LittleV doing a V-Shift Kappa
[0:11:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> @solidus_113 yes
[0:11:09] <%Wouldz> am I weird for enjoying seeing/hearing people talk about fighting games even when I dont understand a single thing that's being said?
[0:11:12] <@Solidus_113> big brain plays
[0:11:18] <%ggbhtg> @Solidus_113 as long as you have meter left Kappa
[0:11:20] <%Amaideus> Nah
[0:11:30] <%Amaideus> I appreciate people talking about loads of things I don't understand
[0:11:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> parry parry parry into super
[0:11:34] <%krispen_wa> i dont even know what the fuck a Rekka even is
[0:11:35] <%Wouldz> like, I'm trying to learn (thanks woolie)
[0:11:37] <VoraciousKain> lately I've been on a killer instinct binge but I haven't played it
[0:11:38] <SivSarcast> Also fun fact, sliding into the BoC location, your character's leg sliding movements are VERY reminiscent of boosting in Armored Core games. A little tidbit there.
[0:11:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> except it's backdash.
[0:11:44] <@Solidus_113> Also Rose has her Alpha 2 shadow hits back
[0:11:46] <%Wouldz> but so much stuff is still alien lmao
[0:11:59] <%Amaideus> Once went on a blind date and the girl dazzled me with facts about Bacteria
[0:12:02] <%RyTYoung> YE
[0:12:02] <mortificent> Dan has a wall bounce
[0:12:08] <Applecannon63> @krispen_wa Chained command special
[0:12:14] <%Amaideus> Unironically the most interesting blind date I've ever been on
[0:12:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> @solidus_113 she might as well have a genai jin
[0:12:28] <%krispen_wa> @applecannon63 the fuck is a chained command
[0:12:29] <VoraciousKain> 3 minuets
[0:12:43] <Vex_Machina> Kreygasm
[0:12:44] <%Amaideus> @krispen_wa A Rekka is an input that has several inputs you can follow up with
[0:12:45] <Applecannon63> repeating the same command input
[0:12:47] <VoraciousKain> oh no
[0:12:53] <+Grayhammatter> it begins
[0:12:55] <%JD_Lars> woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[0:12:56] <%krispen_wa> oooh

[0:17:58] <bevyrage> doesn't his install raise risk while he holds it?
[0:18:05] <brunoberserk> TOKI O TOMARE
[0:18:20] <%Amaideus> "full screen low"
[0:18:21] <Applecannon63> he doesn't lose it
[0:18:22] <noyjatat> daigo compilation when
[0:18:27] <Josef_Stryker> @cvp5127 It seems that they made his V-Trigger no longer permanent but they made it two bars instead of 3
[0:18:30] <%Amaideus> Flashing back to SC6 Seong Mina
[0:18:38] <andre11dr> I didn't think they would give Ky a instant, i really hope Sol still has his
[0:18:38] <@Solidus_113> Necalli's install now goes down, probably because of the V-Shift addition
[0:18:39] <%krispen_wa> he's still gonna be a jobber
[0:18:40] <GeoffGeofreed> What I want to know is, what happens if 2 Axls fight each other and time stopping
[0:18:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he was always built different
[0:19:08] <Applecannon63> V Shift Blanka…
[0:19:15] <%Amaideus> Man, Nekali is the lamest thing that should cool as fuck

[0:19:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> necalli will be left in the nothing really changes corner
[0:20:16] <$USOtaku> I barely understand what they’re talking about
[0:20:25] <mortificent> probably downgraded cause of the V-Shift
[0:20:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> I AM

[0:20:48] <Darren716> LUL
[0:20:48] <Equirah> @USOtaku fg character revolves around a meter and they reworked how the meter works
[0:20:50] <%krispen_wa> Woolie's jargon gets me OUT of fighting games
[0:20:54] <andre11dr> Last time i looked at SFV was 2 years ago, i honestly don't care anymore
[0:20:55] <BenLubar> I have no idea what they're talking about but it's very clear that they do
[0:20:56] <DSD24> Hey man I don't mind people talking about stuff they are passionate about
[0:20:57] <%cvp5127> yes out of spite
[0:21:10] <+eanscrale> Who's Nakelly?
[0:21:10] <%jdhwash> jdhwash is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 4 in the channel! 
[0:21:11] <Darren716> Woolie talking about fighting games is like that Yakuza 0 sub story from yesterday

[0:21:13] <+JaseAdrift> Who cares about Necalli again? Kappa
[0:21:20] <Applecannon63> Woolie talking about fighting games!?
[0:21:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I forget, did Reggie beat Flamelurker or leave him for later?
[0:21:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> man I hope abigial gets more buffs
[0:21:29] <+jiggy_snipe> he beat him
[0:21:30] <Equirah> some people don't know what a hadouken is
[0:21:35] <Darren716> Yeah Flamelurker got stomped
[0:21:42] <alvaroeltz> Ok, but what do you think of v-shift?
[0:21:43] <%krispen_wa> the fuck is a light punch
[0:21:44] <Darren716> Woolie what about the erasable though?
[0:21:46] <Crashfan01> please buff abigail even even more <3
[0:21:47] <BenLubar> @Equirah it's the move where he yells hadouken
[0:21:53] <OldManDeckardCain> capcom nerfed necalli to match his lore strength Kappa
[0:21:54] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Oh snap I might have missed a stream then
[0:21:55] <Rojahh> as long as they dont nerf Balrog/Birdie i'm good

[0:22:18] <BenLubar> @JaseAdrift it's when you dash but not forward

[0:22:30] <leith_aziz> Doesn't GG kinda do this naturally?
[0:22:32] <Darthkitten_Prime> I don't know much about Street Fighter, but hasn't Necalli gotten a pretty bad time of it before this?

[0:23:05] <%Amaideus> Wait a second

[0:23:09] <%Amaideus> You guys can dash?!
[0:23:11] <leith_aziz> This is good, but maybe V-trigger should be used more often?
[0:23:15] <BenLubar> have they fought king dragon yet
[0:23:15] <OldManDeckardCain> I swear if menat's follow up attack from that is shit like her v-reversal....
[0:23:16] <DSD24> @CaptainPileDriver He's from Streets
[0:23:17] <+JaseAdrift> you fighting game players and your terminology
[0:23:19] <+RealPT1> V reversal was there but it's a poor mans Dead Angle
[0:23:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> is ryu a character for people who only like dry white bread
[0:23:29] <%Amaideus> They have not @BenLubar
[0:23:33] <%krispen_wa> @applecannon63 then get stuck on Old Hero for a whole stream

[0:32:50] <andre11dr> Wow ,i completely forgot about that
[0:32:52] <%cache_22> Mom's dead, parkour.
[0:32:56] <leith_aziz> It's just bad with writing
[0:32:58] <%RyTYoung> It's the game that's got the deaf guy from his point of view and theres NO SUBTITLES
[0:33:02] <leith_aziz> Not Japan stuff
[0:33:02] <TigerClaws12> Mom's dead
[0:33:03] <DSD24> That game was real racist too
[0:33:03] <heartlesshealer> it's not great, but it's a thing that happened
[0:33:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Cool trailer
[0:33:06] <%krispen_wa> i keep getting it confused with the much better Quiet Place
[0:33:13] <%Amaideus> Wat
[0:33:19] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> bruh who got a hold of my old therapist?
[0:33:19] <%Amaideus> I went to grab a snack
[0:33:24] <%Amaideus> And I come back to this?
[0:33:24] <%RyTYoung> THEY SHOT HER FOR THE SHOES
[0:33:31] <@Solidus_113> Made by Humanhead, published by Square ENix
[0:33:31] <+xbitwolf> is quiet man just daredevil but deaf?
[0:33:33] <$Noponiz> @WoolieVersus that game is american tho
[0:33:38] <linSP> racist and ableist, like good ol traditional japan
[0:33:40] <leith_aziz> Example ?
[0:33:42] <+Stormzcales_Lair> like Redo of healr
[0:33:42] <DatAsuna> the Quiet Place is actually good, unlike the quiet man
[0:33:52] <$Noponiz> the quiet man has nothing to do with japan
[0:33:53] <+jiggy_snipe> what if you put the Quiet Man in the Quiet Place?
[0:33:54] <%ggbhtg> I have had fantastic therapists, so I'm offended
[0:33:56] <Lewisisphat> yeah, wasn't the quiet man made by the old prey 2 devs?
[0:33:57] <%X2Eliah> I guess "Suck it up, Loser" is a way of therapy in japan?
[0:34:03] <DatAsuna> @noponiz the writer is japanese
[0:34:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> THEME OF SAD
[0:34:04] <%krispen_wa> THEME OF SAD
[0:34:08] <%Reverend_Roscoe> empty swing
[0:34:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Filling the world with assholes LUL
[0:34:24] <%cache_22> It was not a cutscene gun, it does not count.
[0:34:25] <%X2Eliah> Woolie that's a gameplay gun. Gameplay guns don't matter
[0:34:25] <%jdhwash> STEALING A TOY?! STOMP THAT FUCK
[0:34:27] <DatAsuna> the prey 2 devs were just working under square enix japan leads
[0:34:29] <Applecannon63> I'm sorry that I bully a child
[0:34:31] <%McSoliace> you'll get used to it woolie
[0:34:34] <$Noponiz> @DatAsuna a quick google search says it was written by "joey kelly" Doesnt sound very jp to me
[0:34:36] <leith_aziz> I'm pretty sure the gun was for gameplay
[0:34:36] <DatAsuna> they didn't get creative input
[0:34:38] <%kewlmyc> I want that toy, I'LL KILL YOU
[0:34:38] <+jiggy_snipe> but you don't understand, it was a very important game
[0:34:38] <+chronopaladin> cool motive, still murder
[0:34:40] <Belakitu> Speedwagon LUL
[0:34:45] <DSD24> Hey its like Kira's dad in Part 4
[0:34:45] <%jdhwash> no forgiveness. foot to throat.
[0:34:47] <andre11dr> The only thing i know about The Quiet Man was that Jim Sterling video where he GOES OFF on it
[0:34:49] <%ggbhtg> #GameplayGun LUL
[0:34:53] <%cvp5127> is japan big on forgiveness cause of the past ?
[0:34:56] <%JaseAdrift> HELL NO
[0:34:56] <%SouLucha> "But Woolie it's for the LULZ" says reddit... NotLikeThis
[0:34:59] <JetpackMcQuack> We’ve all been there
[0:35:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Real bullets
[0:35:05] <Applecannon63> its a prank
[0:35:06] <leith_aziz> #GameplayGun
[0:35:09] <+paladinstarbuster> people in yakuza are tougher in substories
[0:35:10] <%ggbhtg> @cvp5127 and the respecting
[0:35:11] <%krispen_wa> that's in 5-2
[0:35:12] <%Amaideus> He hasn't even been in that section yet
[0:35:15] <+jiggy_snipe> but you can't die from gameplay guns
[0:35:21] <%tank7013> No he realized what he did was bad so it's fine. The bullet wounds stitched themselves back together :)
[0:35:22] <%ggbhtg> Moonraiti Gureaa
[0:35:24] <+Graxe_> Light Later
[0:35:29] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah that be in 5-2

[0:35:35] <%cvp5127> woolies camera keeps blinking
[0:35:35] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> A mythology gag.
[0:35:38] <%Amaideus> Almost all fromsoft games do
[0:35:38] <@Solidus_113> All the way back to Kingsfield, and even Armoured Core
[0:35:41] <therakishsage> Pretty much every From Software game has it in some capacity.
[0:35:44] <%RyTYoung> Not there yet
[0:35:44] <Basic_Birch_> Did you ever finish Outer Wilds Woolie?
[0:35:47] <%Lion_kun> Ah, you were by my side all along.

[0:35:54] <noyjatat> @WoolieVersus best version of moonlight gs?

[0:36:19] <Applecannon63> Kuuga tho
[0:36:20] <%Amaideus> BB>DS2>DS1>DS3
[0:36:21] <DatAsuna> @noponiz check out the dev letter from kensei fujinaga on "the message he wanted to send" and why he made the first run silent lol
[0:36:24] <%cvp5127> zero-one
[0:36:25] <%Amaideus> I have no rating for DeS
[0:36:28] <Applecannon63> Zero One is great
[0:36:28] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Applecannon63 Kuuga very good
[0:36:38] <andre11dr> It's also pretty cool in Armoured Core
[0:36:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:36:42] <%ggbhtg> I hear ya
[0:36:55] <leith_aziz> There's an animation?
[0:36:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "Best of" when?
[0:36:59] <Mayachacha> wow cool
[0:37:04] <BenLubar> I still haven't worked up the courage to start watching the 13 sentinels LP
[0:37:05] <%krispen_wa> 50 PogChamp
[0:37:06] <DatAsuna> you won't watch 50 episodes in a week, surely
[0:37:12] <%X2Eliah> 50 hrs
[0:37:16] <leith_aziz> Great.....
[0:37:17] <%cvp5127> for what?
[0:37:18] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Kuuga, Agito, Faiz, W, Den-O, Fourze, OOO, Gaim, Drive are all good
[0:37:18] <%X2Eliah> a week has 7x24 hrs
[0:37:21] <leith_aziz> ?
[0:37:21] <Applecannon63> Gaim is great if you can handle the god complex
[0:37:21] <%X2Eliah> so easy
[0:37:22] <+jiggy_snipe> what

[0:37:42] <%cache_22> Woolie had a heated gaming moment? monkaS
[0:37:43] <OldManDeckardCain> hating on megumi is a hate crime Kappa
[0:37:44] <Tooniearcade> brysuSwet brysuSwet brysuSwet brysuSwet
[0:37:44] <JetpackMcQuack> I did that with F#

[0:37:48] <DatAsuna> Gamer
[0:37:49] <andre11dr> BUT YOUR NOT SURE THO LUL
[0:37:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ninja
[0:37:51] <linSP> did someone say run away
[0:37:54] <bevyrage> there's no slur in the entire episode by you guys or the videogame so it's straight up a false report
[0:37:56] <MasterCosmic> A slur got passed Woolie?
[0:37:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> TABARNAK
[0:37:57] <leith_aziz> Crap
[0:37:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Yooo when is Minh coming back?
[0:38:03] <%Amaideus> Imagine if that's how they started getting around people recording endings and shit
[0:38:03] <CaptainBright> Y'all hating on Megumi was real bad
[0:38:12] <alvaroeltz> replace it with a clip of you saying the n word, problably safer
[0:38:14] <%X2Eliah> Wait are you putting MINH on the task of finding the slur? BRUH
[0:38:24] <BenLubar> why don't they ever tell you where the problem is
[0:38:25] <%cvp5127> heard you talking shit about megumi LUL
[0:38:26] <%Amaideus> "Oh yeah this "you're not allowed to record" thing is a slur"
[0:38:27] <+jiggy_snipe> I bet there is no slur
[0:38:34] <%krispen_wa> megumi best girl

[0:38:42] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:38:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> He'll add more
[0:38:43] <%JaseAdrift> Most likely a false flag
[0:38:46] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:38:48] <derap41> minh guards the N card
[0:38:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYYEYE LUL

[0:39:02] <%Amaideus> Why doesn't it come with an auto timestamp
[0:39:03] <%Lion_kun> Might in the editor mines.
[0:39:15] <%X2Eliah> Oh I don't doubt Minh's power, I just remember some dokapon streams xD
[0:39:16] <%astrofizzix> That's a shame. You guys clearly put a lot of work to get that final scene up on youtube.
[0:39:16] <%Lion_kun> Minh in the editor mines.
[0:39:16] <therakishsage> Doubting the power of the Minhegan.
[0:39:24] <%Amaideus> If you say there's a slur, it should be auto flagged at the timestamp
[0:39:27] <Equirah> *extreme* slur
[0:39:32] <Prevot> maybe you said "karen"
[0:39:36] <leith_aziz> How do you deal with it if they don't tell you
[0:39:39] <jetjagger222> X-TREME SLUR
[0:39:40] <Thepothero> Lmao
[0:39:42] <linSP> the slur was virgin

[0:39:55] <%Amaideus> I believe y'all determined it was Packet Loss
[0:39:58] <OldManDeckardCain> king crimson is sfv netcode
[0:40:01] <DSD24> How does King Crimson work
[0:40:02] <@Solidus_113> Ping Crimson
[0:40:04] <%Amaideus> Back in ye olde podcast days
[0:40:06] <treasonodb> start letting us bet channel points on reggies success/failures in demon souls!
[0:40:09] <andre11dr> Just skip the frames
[0:40:09] <@akuda_bar> @Solidus_113 PING crimson
[0:40:09] <%ggbhtg> Rollback with not enough buffer LUL

[0:40:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Happy birthday... kisama...
[0:40:33] <%Amaideus> I forgot about Ping Crimson
[0:40:35] <Pingo_Pasketti> King Crimson is that one clip of Cody teleporting in SF5
[0:40:35] <JetpackMcQuack> One way rollback
[0:40:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it'll be fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[0:40:45] <+wanzerfaust> Killer Queen: Bites the Dust is more rollback-like.
[0:40:47] <Applecannon63> Rollback netcode against a red bar
[0:40:56] <Prevot> doppio is like "bro my wi-fi router is right next to my ps4"
[0:40:59] <%ggbhtg> Ping Crimson is already a podcast or podcast clip title, yesh
[0:41:00] <+Mendin> Ping Crimson drops the bad packets, Gold Experience Requiem ensures your inputs will never reach the server
[0:41:08] <leith_aziz> Eyy, nice work Woolie
[0:41:12] <%ggbhtg> The Loreyard huh
[0:41:17] <+Checktrap> Let’s go Reggie !!!!!!!!
[0:41:20] <%kyh9> Woolie, what games are you most excited for this year?
[0:41:22] <@Solidus_113> hell yeah
[0:41:25] <+Checktrap> Fucking hype !!
[0:41:28] <leith_aziz> Great videos. I appreciate them
[0:41:29] <%krispen_wa> THE BACKYARD
[0:41:32] <Arweynn> by the way woolie's cam occasionally flickers to black and back to normal. reggies doesn't though
[0:41:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if you gaze long enough into the backyard it will gaze back woolie
[0:41:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reggie puts the ep in the Recycle Bin OH NO
[0:41:41] <noyjatat> is that the baz next to kirby in the case?
[0:41:41] <andre11dr> @wanzerfaust Nah ,that's like a ragequit
[0:41:42] <%SouLucha> It was good to me during the livestream.
[0:41:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yaaaay more guilty gear lore!!!!
[0:41:56] <Infinit_Phoenix> GER sends falls packets to the server to forever trap you in different touches of death
[0:42:01] <Applecannon63> Oh boy
[0:42:04] <DSD24> The True Demon's Souls strats here
[0:42:11] <%cvp5127> oh no
[0:42:12] <+Grayhammatter> the backuyardo
[0:42:20] <%ggbhtg> LORE woolieLORE YARD
[0:42:23] <leith_aziz> Though I feel like you got through what's important by now (excluding Ino stuff). Maybe it's enough for now ?
[0:42:24] <andre11dr> Oh God
[0:42:25] <%Amaideus> Nothing good ever happens in back yards
[0:42:26] <gameboiEd> Heya woolie, huge longtime fan from down under. really cool to catch you and Reggie live due to an extremely painful toothache. wishing you good vibes and a great stream. big love
[0:42:32] <%Javaa01> It's a bit loud I think
[0:42:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> might be too loud
[0:42:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> eh
[0:42:37] <%X2Eliah> seems fine-ish for now, maybe bit loud
[0:42:38] <Prevot> sounds loud here but idk
[0:42:39] <%cache_22> The volume seems a bit louder than usual. Yakuza was a bit quiet yesterday.
[0:42:43] <+Grayhammatter> idk, seemed a bit loud
[0:42:49] <%krispen_wa> ON THE FIRST DAY
[0:42:52] <DSD24> Dual Subtitles
[0:42:55] <andre11dr> I little lower is say
[0:42:57] <%RyTYoung> Game is a bit loud
[0:43:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> why they gotta subtitle the TEXT?
[0:43:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> drives me nuts
[0:43:19] <heartlesshealer> it's time it's time it's time
[0:43:28] <%RyTYoung> @canadiananimatorguy Closed captions are hard Kappa
[0:43:29] <%X2Eliah> subbing text might make sense for localizations
[0:43:30] <Applecannon63> cause not everyone can read the text's font
[0:43:31] <DSD24> Different languages I would assume
[0:43:35] <+wanzerfaust> @andre11dr It literally rolls it back, though. With King Crimson, the stuff that gets skipped in between still happened. That's more like delay, where you just zip forward to catch up.
[0:43:44] <+Grayhammatter> welcome back, to the stage of history
[0:43:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:43:46] <DSD24> "Welcome back to the stage of history!"
[0:43:57] <%X2Eliah> Reggie is the Sage of History
[0:43:57] <DSD24> Retold!
[0:44:00] <heartlesshealer> subbing text is always good if there's language options or just one set of vocal dialogue
[0:44:06] <%Javaa01> Oh hey, it's the weed dealer
[0:44:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HE BEAT THE CHAMP
[0:44:14] <devil_ahhhhhh> woolieGIRLS
[0:44:19] <%cache_22> I cannot believe Reggie almost killed Flamelurker in his second try.
[0:44:25] <linSP> Is it time to punch a god
[0:44:27] <%X2Eliah> noticed, did not internalize
[0:44:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> TRUSTY Patches
[0:44:42] <+Grayhammatter> he's your weed dealer
[0:44:48] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @cache_22 yeah if he didn't have that last choke, he woulda had it in the bag
[0:44:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it was an impressive run
[0:44:58] <%X2Eliah> Maybe reggie should go and free up that one guy from the hanging prison cage
[0:45:08] <+Mendin> Patches hooks you up with the primo shit
[0:45:15] <+Mendin> Free delivery
[0:45:16] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I say 5-3 just to get the souls and be done with it
[0:45:17] <DSD24> Reggie needs to go farming
[0:45:22] <OldManDeckardCain> patches would totally shortsell like a madman LUL
[0:45:28] <Thepothero> Preem we re back
[0:45:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> 2-3*
[0:45:33] <%X2Eliah> Patches invests in Dogecoin
[0:45:44] <andre11dr> "YEP I'M THAT GOOD"
[0:45:51] <andre11dr> Ohh ,it later
[0:45:53] <Basic_Birch_> The game sound seems a bit low
[0:46:03] <%X2Eliah> there is game sound? xD
[0:46:08] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:46:21] <+Mendin> The lucerne?
[0:46:26] <DSD24> Patches hates Hedge Funds
[0:46:36] <%ozzrabbit> What about boss weapons?
[0:46:37] <slix3431> Soul stonks go up
[0:46:50] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:46:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:47:00] <%Amaideus> You can't see what boss weapons turn into unless you already have the upgrade level to make them IIRC
[0:47:01] <DatAsuna> yes exactly
[0:47:04] <linSP> dragon weapons lose all scaling right
[0:47:04] <%Amaideus> DeS is gross like that
[0:47:15] <%Lion_kun> Is Reggie gonna do all the tendency events?
[0:47:29] <Belakitu> PogChamp Letsa GO!
[0:47:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD

[0:47:40] <brunoberserk> booooss weapoooooooons
[0:47:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BAWS WEAPONS?
[0:47:48] <Nikbottom> I'm doing it! I'm watching Reggie play Demon's Souls
[0:47:48] <%patriotrenegade> BAWS WEAPONS
[0:47:50] <Josef_Stryker> BOOOOSS WEAPOOOOOOONS
[0:47:51] <+Grayhammatter> BAWS
[0:48:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> BAWS WEAPONS FOR SALE
[0:48:07] <Prevot> he said the thing
[0:48:09] <%patriotrenegade> well some of them
[0:48:13] <andre11dr> Now the question is, does Reggie want the spells or weapons?
[0:48:24] <Belakitu> The choices are yours, AND YOURS ALONE Reggarth!
[0:48:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> we are getting ever closer to lava bow
[0:48:35] <%ozzrabbit> Dammit! Now I’m remembering Ornefix in Happy Souls yelling “BOSS WEAPONS!!!” with a megaphone.
[0:48:37] <andre11dr> Honestly the spells are more useful than the weapons
[0:48:38] <%cache_22> Scraping Spear?
[0:48:43] <%Amaideus> Scraping Spear meta
[0:48:49] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I'd say Woolie should get a guide handy cause remembering all the boss weapon requirements
[0:48:49] <%Amaideus> 2009-forever
[0:48:49] <+Grayhammatter> scraping spear yeyeye
[0:48:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> oh FUCK
[0:48:53] <%Lion_kun> Adjudicator soul, do you want a regen miracle or the best weapon in the game?
[0:48:54] <andre11dr> Most of the boss weapons aren't that great
[0:48:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> is a bitch lol*
[0:49:03] <DatAsuna> the infamous
[0:49:05] <%Lion_kun> CLEAVER IS FANTASTIC
[0:49:06] <Blank9> scraping spear sucks, 15k souls is useful
[0:49:11] <%Livelinne> woolieSPICE woolieKICKDAD woolieVS
[0:49:18] <%Lion_kun> Scales S for 2 stats
[0:49:18] <%Livelinne> o hai
[0:49:19] <DSD24> Scraping Spear sucks to fight against
[0:49:23] <slix3431> woolieCHAN
[0:49:28] <glass_marcus> The Scrapping Spear is for bad people
[0:49:29] <%Amaideus> Mentally speaking
[0:49:30] <andre11dr> Scraping Spear is BIG PVP FUN
[0:49:37] <%Amaideus> Yes, ripping and disemboweling is correct
[0:49:37] <+Grayhammatter> big pvp fun
[0:49:41] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @sonofthedeepsouth
[0:50:03] <DatAsuna> and acid mist too
[0:50:10] <%Amaideus> DeS invaders are SUPER mean
[0:50:11] <slix3431> Reggie doesn't do pvp tho
[0:50:12] <andre11dr> I love my regen Scraping Spear built, it's so disgusting LUM
[0:50:12] <%emperordread> You see a scraping spear, you yeet yourself off a cliff
[0:50:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> Spite
[0:50:17] <linSP> ruin their shit and they can’t defend or attack
[0:50:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's fucking annoying
[0:50:24] <%swordmanegill> swordmanegill subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey woolz! Hey Regg!I'm catching you on the youtube. I'm heading to BJJ practice now! Keep on Keeping on!
[0:50:32] <%Amaideus> Remember when Acid Surge was good for exactly one day in DS3?
[0:50:36] <heartlesshealer> This is why you do what you do in the Nexus
[0:50:42] <%Amaideus> And then it got nerfed straight back to hell after having been buffed?
[0:50:46] <andre11dr> Maximum troll is Scraping Spear and a Storm Ruler
[0:50:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:53] <DSD24> Destroy a mans will to live, by destroying his gear
[0:51:15] <Blank9> might as well just eat it for money
[0:51:17] <@Solidus_113> that's 15k though
[0:51:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> lookit that png wobble
[0:51:18] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> or get 15K
[0:51:21] <andre11dr> Also Soul Suck is pretty fun if you can land it
[0:51:26] <Johannen> +7? That's a lot to ask
[0:51:39] <%Lion_kun> Remember how DS2 just let you turn a soul into a weapon.
[0:51:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Scraping Spear is fair and balanced. People that complain about it are memeing
[0:51:44] <linSP> +7 might be a better spear than scraping
[0:51:44] <%Amaideus> Winged Spear would be fine
[0:51:44] <%Lion_kun> That was nice.
[0:51:54] <DatAsuna> reggie would never bully
[0:52:06] <%Amaideus> So here's my question
[0:52:14] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @lion_kun yeah that was a positive they kept in DS3
[0:52:19] <%Amaideus> How do invaders react to people seeing a player pull out the Scraping Spear?
[0:52:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Lion_kun honestly they should have just added the newer simplified item upgrading. Anyone who complained about diverging from the original should just have something thrown at them
[0:52:32] <%Amaideus> Do they go "nah not worth it"?
[0:52:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Or consume it, Woolie
[0:52:43] <%Javaa01> @Amaideus Unless they have a better gameplan, they usually just peace out
[0:52:47] <%Lion_kun> I agree@LiquidDinosaur
[0:52:53] <+Deekman> brb Epic showcase
[0:52:56] <%Javaa01> But since this is DeS, they probably have a better game plan
[0:53:05] <%Javaa01> Because you can bust this game wide open
[0:53:10] <%Amaideus> Wait, Phalanx's soul gives 15000 but Tower Knight gives 4400?
[0:53:13] <linSP> @javaa01 not worth it if you invade, invaders lose a level for running away or suiciding
[0:53:21] <%nintega010> Has reggie been invaded yet?
[0:53:22] <%Lion_kun> We can fuck the music but god forbid simplify the boss soul weapon system.
[0:53:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> he could burn them for souls and level up
[0:53:28] <andre11dr> @amaideus I usually pull out the Storm Ruler and knock them around the stage till they fall of the stage
[0:53:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> c'mon
[0:53:35] <%Amaideus> They've been ducking invasions the whole LP
[0:53:38] <%dreadedcthulhu> @amaideus 1.5k
[0:53:39] <%Amaideus> And will probably continue to
[0:53:49] <%Amaideus> Ah, I misheard
[0:53:50] <%dreadedcthulhu> fifteen hundred
[0:53:56] <%dreadedcthulhu> yeye
[0:54:04] <%Lion_kun> He's being a coward and throwing himself off ledges.
[0:54:05] <andre11dr> He will eventually have to fight a invader
[0:54:08] <%nintega010> @Amaideus that's fine. Just thought they turned it off.
[0:54:08] <%Amaideus> Man, that soul is so cool
[0:54:10] <+Mendin> Flaming Poison Arrows
[0:54:24] <%JobbedBone> roman candles PogChamp
[0:54:24] <DatAsuna> it's pretty good
[0:54:24] <%Amaideus> Can we talk about how cool some Souls boss souls look?
[0:54:29] <%jdhwash> pew pew pew pew
[0:54:32] <Belakitu> Fire Bow or Fire Gun? LUL
[0:54:33] <%Amaideus> Like the Deep souls in DS3
[0:54:37] <DSD24> I see a dragonfly in the Hard Demon Soul
[0:54:40] <slix3431> Reggie finally gets his firebombs back
[0:54:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Bow would require A LOT of stats, fire spread is equippable now
[0:54:57] <andre11dr> It's supposed to look like a spider
[0:54:57] <DSD24> Short Blow
[0:54:59] <Johannen> With the Tendency system you will avoid all pvp to get to White..otherwise its a shitshow
[0:55:27] <%cache_22> Soul Ray has piercing too, right?
[0:55:32] <DSD24> "The entire congregation saw you you get played" is my favorite title to a video I've seen in awhile
[0:55:33] <Belakitu> Piercing Shot
[0:55:35] <+booty_menace> Souls ray FUCKS
[0:55:41] <linSP> soul ray is great
[0:55:49] <+eanscrale> Soul ray with punch through
[0:55:50] <roarofdamnation> pew pew pew only requires 1 memory
[0:55:57] <slix3431> SWOLE
[0:55:58] <DatAsuna> swole
[0:55:59] <+paladinstarbuster> SWOLE DEMON
[0:56:04] <Belakitu> S W O L E
[0:56:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> BIG SWOLE
[0:56:09] <%JobbedBone> monkaS
[0:56:24] <glass_marcus> Demon's Swoles
[0:56:36] <Belakitu> MEAT CLEAVER
[0:56:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> THIS A KNIFE
[0:56:49] <%krispen_wa> CLEAVE MEAT
[0:56:50] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why are we doing this now? Let's just tackle a new area
[0:56:52] <%JobbedBone> can you upgrade it
[0:56:53] <%Lion_kun> BEST WEAPON
[0:56:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> If the bird was the true monster then why is it named after the fattie?
[0:56:57] <DatAsuna> the matilda look
[0:57:02] <%Lion_kun> STRENGTH AND DEX
[0:57:02] <OblivionSword1> Meat Cleaver is considered a Hammer I think
[0:57:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> 2nd best weapon honestly
[0:57:12] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> the scaling is fucking godtier
[0:57:27] <%Lion_kun> TWO Ss
[0:57:28] <DatAsuna> @abelincoln_catpuncher which is goat for you?
[0:57:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> it's actually a quality weapon, dex scaling is pretty high
[0:57:39] <DatAsuna> Personally I love the istarelle, but that's just me
[0:57:40] <%Lion_kun> DEX IS S
[0:57:49] <Belakitu> Look out for dudes One Handing the MEAT CLEAVER
[0:57:49] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19
[0:57:56] <KaiserMario> Life steal
[0:57:57] <cache_22> Also you get 1% HP back per hit with the Meat Cleaver.
[0:58:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> This build is gonna end up being a jack-of-all-trades cuz Woolie keeps offering things up for Reggie to try and he keeps trying them. Just pick one set of stats and stick with it
[0:58:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember, Reggie, you can cash these in for souls
[0:58:13] <%Lion_kun> Woolie both strength and dex are S for the cleaver.
[0:58:18] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @datasuna Isn't Northern Regalia better technically? even if you need to get all the way to NG+ to get it
[0:58:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie, what is your build right now?
[0:58:25] <linSP> neat clever may be one of the best quality weapons in game
[0:58:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Or just cash them in for souls and get levels
[0:58:32] <DatAsuna> Most people end up like that on first runs, Keigan
[0:58:36] <+paladinstarbuster> Magic quality
[0:58:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> while Cleaver you can get relatively early
[0:58:46] <Blank9> jack of all trades is great in demon's souls, the stat difference between 10 and 30 in a stat for a weapon's gonna be like 10-20% damage
[0:58:47] <Johannen> @KeiganOfAstora That's a terrible advise for a first playthrough thou
[0:58:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> It looks like Reggie is massively confused with all this shit Woolie is throwing at him
[0:58:54] <DatAsuna> People wanna try things, minmaxing isn't for your first souls game
[0:58:57] <Blank9> vs having more spells and weapons
[0:59:10] <%Lion_kun> I rocked cleaver for my first run.
[0:59:10] <+jiggy_snipe> why would you cash them in when you can always get souls another way?
[0:59:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Johannen So first playthrough should have mistakes and fuck ups cuz you learn from them in your next. Except Reggie isn't doing a second playthrough
[0:59:21] <DatAsuna> @abelincoln_catpuncher yeah probably, but I like spears and istarelle can come real early too
[0:59:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> C'mon think about it like an LP
[0:59:31] <%Amaideus> But you'll still learn for your next game
[0:59:32] <andre11dr> Woolie definitely pushing Reggie here
[0:59:48] <%Amaideus> Reggie experimenting now helps him know what he'll want to try in future games
[0:59:54] <DatAsuna> @KeiganOfAstora so you would rather he just never sees 60% of the game?
[0:59:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> poison cloud is very fun
[0:59:57] <+eanscrale> Magic is BUSTED in DeS
[1:00:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> But future games is meaningless for LP purposes, c'mon guys
[1:00:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KeiganOfAstora it's his first lp so he should ruin his game - any more profound wisdom you got?
[1:00:03] <MrGreed93> meat cleaver has S scaling in dex as well by the way
[1:00:07] <OblivionSword1> Chat you're all overly assume things on Woolie
[1:00:08] <Johannen> @KeiganOfAstora Then trying out multiple things is even more of an incentive cause you are not doing a second playthrough
[1:00:13] <therakishsage> POIson-poison-poison
[1:00:17] <+LordCasante> just got in, what'd I miss?
[1:00:20] <+paladinstarbuster> tell reggie to pump magic or forget it
[1:00:23] <KeiganOfAstora> But you end up not being great at any one thing
[1:00:25] <%Amaideus> Limited gameplay experience is also bad for LP purposes though
[1:00:25] <linSP> poisoned things heal less too
[1:00:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Didn't Pat warn about this?
[1:00:31] <%Lion_kun> Then they nerfed magic in DS1 like cowards.
[1:00:40] <+Mendin> Reggie's aiming for like Quality-Spellblade or something
[1:00:41] <DatAsuna> You want Reggie to play like pat of all people???
[1:00:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> When im playing a new game i want to be spoiled exactly as much as it takes for me to not accidentally ruin my playthrough and no further
[1:00:46] <SeniorTop> Hey, chat. How long has Woolie been live?
[1:00:52] <DatAsuna> Patrick "pump everything into HP" boivin?

[1:00:55] <+jiggy_snipe> no one knows what Reggie is gonna do? He's just learning what these are. Stop assuming
[1:00:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Souls games are so hard to LP. You either do what you want or feel obligated to showcase everything the game has to offer, affecting your build
[1:00:57] <%JobbedBone> PogChamp
[1:01:07] <%Amaideus> And your build only actually matters for PVP
[1:01:10] <CappuccinoGuil> You gotta pick ONE boss weapon to upgrade
[1:01:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @seniortop 30 some years
[1:01:16] <Belakitu> @SeniorTop less than an hour of playing
[1:01:21] <DatAsuna> @KeiganOfAstora It's not showcasing when it's new to you, it's trying things
[1:01:29] <%kewlmyc> I wouldn't say it's "cool", more "annoying", but yeah
[1:01:30] <%Lion_kun> Can you farm colourless souls?
[1:01:33] <SeniorTop> @Belakitu Thanks.
[1:01:34] <DatAsuna> The LP doesn't exist as an advert to sell the game
[1:01:34] <andre11dr> @keiganofastora That only matters if he wants to do NG+ he can totally beat the game throwing stats all around
[1:01:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @SeniorTop about 35 years
[1:01:47] <%bread_assassin> Ya gotta exhaust the game to get all those colorless demon souls, too.
[1:01:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> I never said he couldn't beat the game, just that he won't be really strong at any one thing. To each their own
[1:02:09] <Johannen> Dont you need Black Tendency to get Colorless Souls?
[1:02:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> freaking world tendency is so cool yet so dumb
[1:02:14] <linSP> there’s like 1 in each world, you find one in 1-1, and two from sparkly, so 8 colorless per ng
[1:02:26] <%kewlmyc> @Lion_kun No, they are select drops from specific monsters that only drop once in a playthrough. Also given in specific situations once in a playthough.
[1:02:34] <+Amaideus> There's simultaneously too many ways to affect WT while also not being enough ways to affect it
[1:02:35] <andre11dr> Well nobody has a great built the first time they play these games
[1:02:37] <Belakitu> Thats what Quality builds are all about, trying things out, tasting the buffet
[1:02:40] <Blank9> better to be good at everything than 20% better at one but 20% worse at every other
[1:02:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> I did, cuz I used a wiki. is that wrong of me?
[1:02:52] <%bread_assassin> @linSP You get some from Mephistopheles, too IIRC
[1:02:52] <DatAsuna> @KeiganOfAstora yeah, but it's the "showcase" phrasing that comes off weird, why would reggie be trying to showcase a game he's not played before rather than explore it?
[1:02:53] <%kewlmyc> To get more, you need to do NG+
[1:02:53] <%Amaideus> YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT
[1:03:02] <Darren716> Re crap?
[1:03:06] <DatAsuna> Showcasing is for familiarity
[1:03:06] <%krispen_wa> Re-crap
[1:03:07] <@akuda_bar> ReCrap.
[1:03:10] <%kewlmyc> Re-Crap
[1:03:20] <Belakitu> Re-crap guide to DnD
[1:03:24] <%Lion_kun> DS1 improved DES with demon titanite being the upgrade material which was much easier to get and farmable.
[1:03:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> @DatAsuna I think it's the psychology of LPing a game for people. You feel like you need to show off the game, not just play it for yourself
[1:03:28] <peachy996> Of all the ways to mess up that word you chose the funniest
[1:03:46] <%Lion_kun> Then DS2 and DS3 made it even easier.
[1:04:09] <DatAsuna> @KeiganOfAstora And I think that's a bit too broad to apply to LPing in general rather than case by case based on the individual's experience
[1:04:19] <+Deekman> omg the epic games stream is on fire
[1:04:24] <DatAsuna> Matt LPing no more heroes was a showcase, cause matt knows no more heroes
[1:04:28] <+Deekman> it's falling apart
[1:04:36] <linSP> yeyeye psaUp
[1:04:42] <+jiggy_snipe> @Deekman excuse me?
[1:04:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, I just figured it was affecting things. This is all new to Reggie so he should be safe from those ideas
[1:04:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:04:50] <roarofdamnation> @Deekman Did you really come here to promote a different stream?
[1:05:02] <+Deekman> @jiggy_snipe the epic games spring showcase stream on youtube keeps glitching like crazy, they just announced kingdom hearts for pc
[1:05:10] <+Deekman> @Deekman nah i'm watching both
[1:05:12] <%KeiganOfAstora> Okay?
[1:05:14] <SeniorTop> Have they finished archstone 2-3 ?
[1:05:15] <%Amaideus> Which KH?
[1:05:23] <+Deekman> @Amaideus all of them
[1:05:26] <%Amaideus> Nice
[1:05:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't think they did 2-3
[1:05:33] <+jiggy_snipe> that's cool
[1:05:34] <%JobbedBone> do all humans come back in spirit form or is that the work of the nexus
[1:05:40] <+Grayhammatter> almost goomba stomped freke
[1:05:42] <roarofdamnation> Meh call me back when they bring Dragon Quest to PC
[1:05:45] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus finish up 2-3! it's so close
[1:05:45] <%Amaideus> Time for KH2 to get modded into an even bigger god-game
[1:05:58] <DatAsuna> Miracle squad > magic squad
[1:06:08] <ronin19xx> Low game audio
[1:06:14] <andre11dr> Remember in the DS2 LP when Woolie used THE SAME GREATSWORD with the SAME ARMOUR that everyone uses on first playing? Iea im still mad about that
[1:06:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Also, some bosses are weak to poison LUL
[1:06:25] <slix3431> FART MAGIC
[1:06:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> in other games there's a cost sometimes
[1:06:28] <Basic_Birch_> Could you turn the game sound up a bit?
[1:06:29] <Necnill> rubr2319
[1:06:35] <sweenicus> farther gas obtained
[1:06:43] <+Grayhammatter> fart gas obtained
[1:06:45] <roarofdamnation> Holly shit it is the beginning of Magical Reggi!!!
[1:06:59] <%JobbedBone> warding STRONG
[1:07:09] <DatAsuna> @andre11dr now you just reminded me of pre-nerf miracle builds tho xD
[1:07:12] <%Amaideus> Which is better chat
[1:07:14] <+chiazam> Did Reggie start buildong a magic character?
[1:07:20] <DatAsuna> gods we were strong back then
[1:07:20] <%Amaideus> Warding, or DS1 Power Within?
[1:07:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's time for Mahou Shonen Reggie MAgica
[1:07:24] <roarofdamnation> Water veil lets you walk on water
[1:07:32] <%Lion_kun> A cool build would be a faith/spell hybrid build. It'd be a nice thematic story about a character trying to reconcile two belief systems who hate each other.
[1:07:35] <DatAsuna> we'd cave in their chests with repel force
[1:07:36] <roarofdamnation> lava i mean
[1:07:39] <SteinsApprentice> it does what now
[1:07:44] <%Lion_kun> Dunno how viable it is though.
[1:07:59] <andre11dr> @amaideus Power Within definitely
[1:08:10] <%Amaideus> Does whatsherface the witch give you different boss soul options?
[1:08:12] <DatAsuna> reggie going the honorable route
[1:08:17] <%Amaideus> I didn't play a mage in my DeS run
[1:08:34] <redrins> she does
[1:08:45] <andre11dr> Especially on R1 spam builts PW was really good in DS1
[1:08:50] <DatAsuna> The main problem with souls poison is there's no way to increase the tick rate
[1:09:01] <ronin19xx> Low game audio Woolz
[1:09:03] <DatAsuna> So it's kinda lame compared to other games poison builds
[1:09:09] <%X2Eliah> can you double stack the poison dot?
[1:09:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Game low
[1:09:11] <%Amaideus> DS2 poison builds are legit though
[1:09:16] <%Amaideus> You can stack poison with toxic
[1:09:17] <%JobbedBone> souls poison could work if it used stacks yeah
[1:09:23] <%Amaideus> You can't stack it ontop of itself
[1:09:27] <Ilkim61> what's the sword?
[1:09:32] <andre11dr> Poison is the best in this game i feel
[1:09:44] <Belakitu> Wheres AVADA KEDEVRA?
[1:09:45] <@Solidus_113> dual wield poison broken swords in DS2
[1:09:55] <DatAsuna> Primo-poison in other RPGs is where it can stack AND you can force ticks on those stacks as well
[1:10:00] <andre11dr> Because you can stack poison untop of plague and bleed
[1:10:11] <+paladinstarbuster> looks garbo need to see the damage
[1:10:15] <DatAsuna> So it's like building up power until they suddenly melt
[1:10:36] <redrins> might wanna bump up the game audio a bit
[1:10:42] <ronin19xx> Game audio low
[1:10:57] <$thomassolorio> ifits pure white its all right
[1:11:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah game audio could be a bit higher
[1:11:14] <andre11dr> When you get all dots going shit just melts in this game
[1:11:17] <%JobbedBone> faith requirement
[1:11:31] <%Amaideus> Cleaver is stronk
[1:11:31] <Mundkipz> is it time to try a different area?
[1:11:38] <%Lion_kun> TOLD YA
[1:11:39] <Blank9> big meat cleaving coming up

[1:14:08] <%Amaideus> He can 2 hand it
[1:14:10] <andre11dr> I feel like Woolie should've at least told Reggie to keep strong in one stat instead of going " Hei you can use this and this and this"

[1:41:23] <DSD24> How sword is this sword
[1:41:24] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> but what if I just hit REALLY REALLY HARD?
[1:41:25] <wantedsafe471> so do you intend on using the big sword, or the biggest sword?
[1:41:26] <%Amaideus> If you smash something so hard it rips
[1:41:30] <DatAsuna> This is more like a big club
[1:41:33] <%Amaideus> Can you NOT call it a sword?
[1:41:34] <Equirah> yes actually LUL
[1:41:40] <%X2Eliah> You could poison-cloud the dragon god xD
[1:41:40] <coracor> on the scale of dragon slayer to excalibur, it's .8 dragon slayers
[1:41:42] <+jiggy_snipe> I think a sword needs to have a blade to be a sword by definition
[1:41:58] <kaptain_marty> it was too big to be called a sword
[1:42:07] <Johannen> Its not a Dragon Bone Sword now is it...its a SMASHA
[1:42:14] <+jiggy_snipe> ^
[1:42:18] <DatAsuna> it ain't a dragon cutter
[1:42:19] <+yukichocomilk> it's more like a blunt weapon than a sword. it's just designed like a sword
[1:42:24] <Belakitu> FAT R O L L
[1:42:44] <+Grayhammatter> the fattest of rolls
[1:42:49] <andre11dr> Swords have to be : A sharp ,B longer than knifes
[1:42:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Ey you can play Fat Rollin' if you're a god
[1:42:55] <Belakitu> Texas Road House Rolls
[1:42:59] <+Ether101_Prime> From what I understand, there's a common misconception that midevil swords where heavy and not sharp.
[1:42:59] <Equirah> DBS does triple the damage easy @WoolieVersus
[1:43:02] <%X2Eliah> It's a sharp looking thing
[1:43:19] <Ilkim61> note the decent block strength as well
[1:43:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> psaBig KAPOW psaBig KAPOW psaBig KAPOW
[1:43:25] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[1:43:37] <Darren716> Honestly reggie doesnt have to take a lot off to get his roll
[1:43:37] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Reggie didn't see the R2-R2 attack, it's not great but cool looking
[1:43:38] <Equirah> @Ether101_Prime depends on the type of sword, region and era
[1:43:42] <andre11dr> Well it's not like it's going to be useful here but Reggie doesn't know that yet
[1:43:55] <+Grim1952> Meat cleaver is a giant club though, has magic damage and heals you
[1:44:01] <Tuna_Can_0> naked build Kreygasm
[1:44:21] <Equirah> unequip one of the weapons

[1:44:32] <MyNameIsRasus> reggie do the no pants dance
[1:44:33] <DSD24> Hmmm Woolie take the pants off?
[1:44:36] <Tuna_Can_0> take off all your armor, its souls tradition
[1:44:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think it's kitchen knife time
[1:44:39] <+Grim1952> Meat cleaver bonks too
[1:44:47] <Johannen> "Take some pants off"...hmmmm Kappa
[1:44:55] <DSD24> Clothes were invented by the man to keep us down
[1:44:58] <+Ether101_Prime> @Ether101_Prime From what I get they tend to be sharp regardless, some happen to relay on their own weight to push the blade.
[1:45:03] <%X2Eliah> BUT THE BOSS IS A DRAGON. And this is a DRAGON SMASHER
[1:45:10] <wantedsafe471> send back all the weapons you arent using
[1:45:12] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus 90 -72

[1:45:38] <%Cozy90> are we gonna be pyramid head or guts?
[1:46:05] <LunarRemix> But one heals you though
[1:46:05] <andre11dr> @x2eliah you'd think it would work like that not really
[1:46:08] <%X2Eliah> 277 vs 343.. that's like 20% diff
[1:46:15] <resloxxx> True

[1:46:17] <Visorak6> cleaver has lifesteal too though

[1:46:35] <%Pillagius> dualwield them! Pyramid Guts!
[1:46:43] <%X2Eliah> No legit, take off pants
[1:46:45] <%Cozy90> @Pillagius :O
[1:46:45] <OblivionSword1> might as well unequip the arrows
[1:46:46] <%BinaryFireball> if you want smash use hammer
[1:46:48] <DSD24> Imagine how busted it would be if Pyramid Head had a Scraping Spear in SH2

[1:54:37] <%patriotrenegade> THESE HANDS RATED W FOR EVERYONE
[1:54:46] <resloxxx> LUL
[1:54:47] <NeonBleu> Let me teach you somethin, youngblood
[1:54:47] <%Amaideus> BoC is a platforming boss
[1:54:50] <%Amaideus> In SOULS
[1:55:00] <%Amaideus> It's the worst by default, even before the rest of its BS
[1:55:09] <wantedsafe471> i'd saw BoC is way worse than Dragon god
[1:55:12] <Darren716> LUL
[1:55:13] <nailwind> I just remembered Dark Souls 2 literally has an identical boss to this
[1:55:16] <%krispen_wa> COMBO'D
[1:55:17] <%jdhwash> fingered
[1:55:18] <+Stormzcales_Lair> it does have 2 claws
[1:55:21] <Belakitu> LUL Simply TOUCHING THE FIST
[1:55:21] <+b_aleph> LUL
[1:55:22] <+Amaideus> Even the boss that's literally a room full of enemies with a HP bar is a better boss than BoC
[1:55:23] <%X2Eliah> woolieKICKDAD woolieGLORY woolieVS NotLikeThis
[1:55:23] <LVL1_Scumbag> poke
[1:55:25] <MyNameIsRasus> the ol' 1 2
[1:55:26] <%Amaideus> Holy shit huge deja vu
[1:55:28] <brunoberserk> 2 HITS
[1:55:33] <HarmlessCrow> I feel like BoC is worse because of the run back every time
[1:55:36] <MyNameIsRasus> he hit confirmed that
[1:55:39] <+b_aleph> HIT CONFIRM!
[1:55:39] <+Grayhammatter> give him the old 1-2
[1:55:43] <HarmlessCrow> But Dragon God is absolutely more bullshit
[1:55:43] <nailwind> BoC gives you the mario slide though
[1:55:43] <%jdhwash> the ol' razzle dazzle
[1:55:47] <peachy996> They managed to learn by the time of Bloodborne. To NOT include stuff like Dragon God or BoC
[1:55:56] <Darren716> I'd say this is more similar to Ceaseless Discharge
[1:56:06] <%Amaideus> Then they unlearned it for DS3 with the Wyvern
[1:56:07] <%jdhwash> panic swipe
[1:56:11] <%Amaideus> Though at least the gauntlet isn't awful
[1:56:12] <+b_aleph> it's ok Reggie, HE DIDN'T EARN THOSE POINTS
[1:56:12] <HarmlessCrow> @peachy996 And even then they pushed it with Mr.Micolash
[1:56:13] <peachy996> Lol yeah
[1:56:14] <%jdhwash> get that sword outta here
[1:56:16] <andre11dr> Close my eyes and seize it ,i clench my fist and beat it ,i light my torch and burn it
[1:56:16] <%Juriasu> eww it touched me
[1:56:18] <%krispen_wa> And the one gimmicky boss in Sekiro is the coolest in the game
[1:56:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> how?
[1:56:23] <nailwind> talk to us, Reggie
[1:56:31] <+Grayhammatter> talk to us reggie
[1:56:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Ask yourself questions, reggie
[1:56:45] <+Checktrap> The camera is ass
[1:56:50] <nailwind> enlighten yourself, Reggie
[1:56:50] <linSP> Open the cab of beans reggie!
[1:56:51] <CappuccinoGuil> We'll be the rubber ducky, let's code
[1:56:54] <wantedsafe471> His eyes turn red when he attacks, look at him every one once in a while
[1:56:54] <linSP> can*
[1:56:56] <HarmlessCrow> Sekiro has TWO mega gimmick bosses
[1:56:57] <%jdhwash> well it's just a hop skip and a jump so balls first reg
[1:56:58] <Johannen> @krispen_wa Hell Yeah..that shiz was the coolest Souls Boss
[1:57:02] <%X2Eliah> Consider, is the dragon even punching? Or is it the spoon that is bending the world?
[1:57:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> SOMETIMES YOU WANNA GO-
[1:57:06] <Belakitu> SHINY BUG THO
[1:57:07] <+Stormzcales_Lair> think aloud
[1:57:11] <peachy996> @HarmlessCrow I feel like Defiled Amy is the closest comparison to this
[1:57:16] <%jdhwash> there is reg
[1:57:19] <%jdhwash> yes there is
[1:57:23] <Heroes_of_Vale> Za Hando
[1:57:24] <peachy996> Miccolash is silly but not bad
[1:57:32] <LunarRemix> He's learning
[1:57:40] <%Juriasu> watch out for the second swallow
[1:57:41] <%Amaideus> Mfw I have like 200000 blood echoes and defiled amy oneshots me as I'm exiting the fog wall
[1:57:42] <RamenRiderZ> At least the path to the boss is empty
[1:57:46] <%jdhwash> cower towards the first fist like a champion
[1:57:54] <%X2Eliah> So uh can you block it?
[1:57:59] <%HeroToxiko> is his hand too big
[1:58:00] <Rojahh> "FUCK YOU IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD" Dragon God
[1:58:01] <linSP> dragon is in rush mode
[1:58:15] <peachy996> @Amaideus Yeah that sucks lol happened to me yesterday
[1:58:28] <%HeroToxiko> @X2Eliah he taps twice so i doubt it
[1:58:29] <HarmlessCrow> Defiled Amy iks beyond even any of the others. It's like a boss that actually cheats
[1:58:32] <%krispen_wa> ZA HANDO
[1:58:36] <%X2Eliah> You might want to find the safe spot
[1:58:39] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[1:58:41] <%jdhwash> nice
[1:58:54] <%jdhwash> safu spotu
[1:59:04] <+Colby_DJ> so keep doing it
[1:59:04] <Johannen> "I dont think i missed something over there" every souls player that missed something
[1:59:05] <+Amaideus> Defiled Amy is like base Ancient Draogn in DS2
[1:59:05] <HarmlessCrow> Anyone got a DG kill counter
[1:59:06] <peachy996> I've yet to beat Defiled Amy by myself but I get closer with each death
[1:59:12] <%Amaideus> Or trying to fight Hellkite legit in DS1
[1:59:12] <%krispen_wa> the definition of insanity is Reggie
[1:59:13] <%Cozy90> jacobs ladder
[1:59:22] <%cache_22> I will admit that I cheesed this boss by just using ranged weapons to destroy the obstacles.
[1:59:23] <SeniorTop> This fight looks cool, but the mechanics rival Bed of Chaos.
[1:59:24] <MyNameIsRasus> @Johannen people don't think it be like that but it do
[1:59:26] <%X2Eliah> You say "Insanity" but it worked at Fool's Idol
[1:59:28] <Tempmael> gotta figure out those dragon tells
[1:59:32] <andre11dr> I will say, the boss gimmicks do make DeS stand out against all of the Souls games
[1:59:33] <wantedsafe471> How bad is defiled amy? never got too far into the dungeons, got bored of them after a while
[1:59:41] <%Amaideus> It literally oneshots you
[1:59:45] <%Amaideus> Even if you have like 40 vit
[1:59:49] <wantedsafe471> christ
[1:59:52] <%krispen_wa> @wantedsafe471 hell as melee. easy as fuck with ranged
[1:59:54] <%patriotrenegade> He's not awful
[1:59:54] <KaiserMario> Woolie's looking a little tired today, is it just his "resting bitch face"?
[2:00:01] <%Amaideus> The dungeon it's in halves your HP and the damage you take from physical damage
[2:00:06] <Ilkim61> just his face
[2:00:07] <HarmlessCrow> My lukewarm take is that none of the soulsborne drakes have ever been fun. Basically just cheese them or pass an hp check
[2:00:12] <coracor> wow rude
[2:00:13] <%jdhwash> called him stupid, get fisted
[2:00:13] <%Amaideus> Then throws bosses that do magic damage and fire damage
[2:00:15] <%p4ntless> shit I overslept, what did I miss chat?
[2:00:17] <Tempmael> reggarth full john cena'd
[2:00:20] <%X2Eliah> I hope Reggie saw that thing
[2:00:22] <%Amaideus> It's fucking awful
[2:00:24] <nailwind> Kappa yet you fall for him, Reggie
[2:00:25] <%X2Eliah> that tell
[2:00:30] <Aydarkzero> Reggie you can't just say that after it bobbed you like 10 times now Kappa
[2:00:41] <peachy996> But even then all Defiled Amy does is gatekeep the Chalice Dungeons which you don't have to do
[2:00:45] <%patriotrenegade> Look, just get good, that's all.
[2:00:46] <%Amaideus> Defiled helldog was fun in a "I have to execute perfectly for 3 minutes" kind of way
[2:00:50] <wantedsafe471> well, seems like not diving into the dungeons might have saved my sanity
[2:00:53] <%Juriasu> LUL

[2:01:02] <%Amaideus> But amy is BS because you have to hit specific spots to make it not take a fucking hour
[2:01:03] <Aydarkzero> Dragon God has ultra instinct punches
[2:01:04] <%HeroToxiko> there are yet places fist can't reach Sadge
[2:01:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> Shotgun fist
[2:01:09] <MyNameIsRasus> the hitbox is kinda shit
[2:01:12] <%Amaideus> And it can RNG oneshot you just for walking through the door
[2:01:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:01:17] <%X2Eliah> Yeah that hitbox is bs
[2:01:19] <%krispen_wa> defiled fuccdoge is basically "back up for 3 minutes"
[2:01:19] <peachy996> Defiled Hotdog you execute perfectly and wait 10 minutes so he barfs, he takes a while
[2:01:27] <linSP> Defiled Amy can be cheesed tho
[2:01:30] <Johannen> Dragon God uses Wind Punch
[2:01:30] <andre11dr> I like how they worshipped this thing as a god ,but all it can do is punch and shoot some fire LUL
[2:01:37] <KaiserMario> In the Original it was easier to see, every punch had an explosion effect
[2:01:37] <%Amaideus> You can get around the dogs legs well enough
[2:01:40] <%patriotrenegade> When he rips his arms off, stay under him. he'll loop into the jumping stomp and you can smack his head and arms when he lands.
[2:01:40] <LunarRemix> The PS5 loadtimes makes this much more bearable
[2:01:43] <DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! Attack and Dethrone Dragon God
[2:01:45] <%Amaideus> But it's still a PITA
[2:01:49] <%X2Eliah> TRY STEALTH
[2:01:57] <peachy996> Defiled Amy is fine up until last phase and he slams his weapon down at you
[2:02:00] <%Amaideus> The FPS also shit itself whenever Dragon God punched though
[2:02:04] <%krispen_wa> WOMBO COMBO
[2:02:07] <+Grayhammatter> reggie...
[2:02:08] <+CookieCutter007> LUL the lingering hitbox
[2:02:10] <peachy996> I dont know where to dodge that yet
[2:02:11] <Belakitu> So the shiny bugs will keep spawning until you hit them, and if you don't kill them, THEN they despawn forever?
[2:02:13] <wantedsafe471> a lingering hitbox
[2:02:30] <%Amaideus> @peachy996 Would you like advice?
[2:02:32] <MyNameIsRasus> there are some bosses in souls games whose sole dificulty comes from shitty hitboxes (looking at you smelter fuck)
[2:02:45] <%HeroToxiko> @MyNameIsRasus many
[2:02:57] <%X2Eliah> Has Reggie spotted the tell?
[2:03:05] <andre11dr> I don't remember how Woolie did here ,didn't he beat it the first time?
[2:03:05] <%X2Eliah> REGGIE WHAT IS THE TELL?
[2:03:06] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:03:06] <peachy996> @Amaideus Honestly? Not really. I'm having fun figuring it out slowly. I

[2:03:13] <%krispen_wa> alright we're talking shitty souls bosses...what is the PERFECT souls fight?

[2:03:29] <%krispen_wa> WOMBO'D
[2:03:32] <SeniorTop> @andre11dr First time, but he had like 2 souls game under his belt at that point and 3 guides.
[2:03:37] <HarmlessCrow> RUN IT BACK
[2:03:40] <%ZweihanderSteve> that was good
[2:03:40] <nailwind> whats the verdict, Regginald
[2:03:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie, can you roll under his hand? Yes or no?
[2:03:46] <%HeroToxiko> he just wanna show you some memes on his phone LUL
[2:03:48] <wantedsafe471> would the thief's ring help?
[2:03:50] <linSP> Maria is a perfect souls fight
[2:03:55] <%krispen_wa> Gathered that Dragon God is bullshit
[2:03:58] <%Amaideus> Maria's too easy to parry IMO
[2:04:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Isn't this just a timing puzzle?
[2:04:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @wantedsafe471 it breaks the fight LUL
[2:04:00] <%Amaideus> But she's super cool
[2:04:11] <%Amaideus> I think the perfect Souls fight is Friede
[2:04:14] <wantedsafe471> but it is still an option at this point
[2:04:16] <%krispen_wa> Ivory King is my personal favorite because of how many feints he does
[2:04:25] <MyNameIsRasus> SingsNote i can swallow a hanful of full moon grass and i'll feel like dragon god SingsNote
[2:04:26] <%Amaideus> You get every kind of fight they have, all in at least High quality
[2:04:27] <andre11dr> @linsp I like Ludwig better, sorry
[2:04:29] <brunoberserk> '' SOMEBODY GETTING PUUUUNCHED ''
[2:04:32] <HarmlessCrow> Dragon God is the heightened form of the average Dhalsim player
[2:04:32] <peachy996> Maria is great. The Shield you find helps in blocking her big stabbo
[2:04:35] <MyNameIsRasus> GET PUNCHED
[2:04:41] <%Amaideus> Phase 1 is a gimmick, phase 2 is a duo, phase 3 is a straight on duel

[2:05:03] <%krispen_wa> Raime does the feints
[2:05:10] <Belakitu> Download processing...
[2:05:10] <wantedsafe471> Raime is pretty good
[2:05:15] <%Amaideus> Raime is great

[2:05:28] <mrblack499> wait he is a spotlight lol
[2:05:34] <+Colby_DJ> The blinking eyes creep me out
[2:05:36] <SeniorTop> Dragon God is the Bed of Chaos of Demon's Souls
[2:05:36] <andre11dr> Raime sucks compared everyone in Bloodborne and DS3
[2:05:41] <%krispen_wa> Just clip through the walls, Reggie!
[2:05:42] <%Amaideus> Yeah
[2:05:43] <wantedsafe471> his eyes are the tell

[2:06:19] <%X2Eliah> right approach
[2:06:24] <%Amaideus> No boss in DeS/DS1/DS2 can compare to the bosses in BB/3 because of the console gap
[2:06:37] <%Amaideus> IMO at least
[2:06:40] <Belakitu> You got that axe
[2:06:47] <+Grayhammatter> you got that axe
[2:06:49] <Kiras86> Proud of Woolie, he doesn't look impatient at all! I totally am though lol
[2:06:53] <+0neReeler> 👀
[2:06:54] <%krispen_wa> bosses in DS3 also can be roll spammed
[2:06:54] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Reggie should put on invisibility cloak
[2:06:56] <andre11dr> Also, Sekiro bosses are pretty OD
[2:07:07] <Basic_Birch_> Greatest axe
[2:07:17] <Belakitu> Stay perfectly still, it senses movement monkaS
[2:07:20] <%Amaideus> Sekiro bosses are literally the only thing I actually like that game tbh
[2:07:25] <%Lion_kun> This boss is so bad, I don't even engage with the awful stealth mechanic, I just tank through.
[2:07:30] <Aydarkzero> Dragon God is inside you!
[2:07:33] <%Amaideus> Man, Isshin is a fucking godly fight though
[2:07:35] <%krispen_wa> Just use the thief ring or something
[2:07:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie now knows what it feels like to watch a WoolieVs LP
[2:07:47] <%X2Eliah> xD
[2:07:47] <nailwind> patience of a saint
[2:07:51] <Belakitu> Would the thief ring work on THAT? LUL
[2:07:53] <%ChoculaUltra> I really loved the Owl fights in Sekiro too
[2:07:55] <WackyModder84> How does a god not have the ability to punch thru a wall?
[2:07:57] <CappuccinoGuil> It's kinda like the distance you're trying to run is too long to make without the dragon seeing you and there should be some kinda WALL halfway there? LUL
[2:08:02] <DeathByPoke7> you must defeat his shoryuken to stand a chance
[2:08:03] <+Colby_DJ> @Amaideus mostly agree. I feel like Sekiro development started with boss combat and branched out from there
[2:08:09] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, i just used warding when i fought him and tanked through the hits when i did it.
[2:08:12] <%X2Eliah> @MyNameIsRasus trufax
[2:08:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:08:13] <Basic_Birch_> Use the poison cloud lol
[2:08:19] <nailwind> bopped
[2:08:20] <%krispen_wa> LINGERING HITBOX
[2:08:21] <OblivionSword1> Still alive
[2:08:27] <Kiras86> Sekiro was such an amazing game, only finished it once, will totally do another playthrough soon
[2:08:28] <nailwind> caught your toe
[2:08:30] <OblivionSword1> nvm
[2:08:32] <Belakitu> PALM BREAKER
[2:08:33] <DeathByPoke7> clipped
[2:08:33] <+Grayhammatter> clipped
[2:08:34] <LunarRemix> Reggie keeps trying to rush
[2:08:35] <%X2Eliah> you know this might have worked out
[2:08:39] <%ChoculaUltra> he knew the frame data
[2:08:49] <%krispen_wa> Alright, best fight in Nioh 2?
[2:08:57] <nailwind> he caught the KBD
[2:08:58] <MyNameIsRasus> sports
[2:08:59] <+jiggy_snipe> KappaHD
[2:09:05] <%krispen_wa> and why is it NOT that onmyo mage fuck or Kukai
[2:09:10] <Parapattern> Underground Temple; Underground Monk
[2:09:21] <%Amaideus> Haven't played Nioh 2 yet, no opinion
[2:09:23] <+jiggy_snipe> well Reggie, this is the true Demon's Souls experience
[2:09:24] <andre11dr> The final bosses of Sekiro are probably my favorite of the final bosses in Souls, which says a lot considering how much i love Gherman and Soul of Cinder
[2:09:36] <LordOfThePoultry> @krispen_wa please don't talk about those two
[2:09:38] <HarmlessCrow> But Gherman is SO SICK
[2:09:42] <%X2Eliah> HEAL
[2:09:55] <%krispen_wa> PROGRESS?
[2:10:01] <%Amaideus> I legit forget about Gherman because I never actually finish BB runs
[2:10:04] <SeniorTop> Sword Saint Isshin is one of the best fights Miyazaki has ever designed.
[2:10:06] <%Amaideus> But he's pretty great
[2:10:12] <%krispen_wa> No progress
[2:10:28] <%Amaideus> My first BB run was Kirkhammer all the way with only 17 vit
[2:10:30] <nailwind> music for Ludwig's fight in BB still puts it above everything else
[2:10:33] <%Amaideus> Gehrman was MEAN
[2:10:33] <%X2Eliah> CAN HE?
[2:10:42] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:10:45] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:10:51] <HarmlessCrow> Sekiro final boss easily wins best gameplay, but holy shit the music and setting of the Gherman fight it unbeatable
[2:10:51] <peachy996> Ludwig music is great but Laurence has that part
[2:10:55] <andre11dr> It's kinda funny, DS1 haa like the weakest final boss LUL
[2:10:56] <+Deekman> would it help with the thiefs ring?
[2:11:01] <%X2Eliah> Gaskwang was the best boss
[2:11:10] <%Amaideus> Gwyn's a great last boss if you DON'T parry him
[2:11:12] <%krispen_wa> best boss is Covetous Demon
[2:11:14] <%Amaideus> He's actually legit
[2:11:15] <HarmlessCrow> @andre11dr Sir you forgetting DS2?
[2:11:18] <Darren716> At least it's fitting for DS1
[2:11:18] <%HeroToxiko> tech
[2:11:19] <peachy996> And Living Failures is such a great theme too
[2:11:22] <andre11dr> No wait, never mind I forgot DS2 existed LUL
[2:11:30] <%AMUSERNAME> @SeniorTop I'd have a hard time saying whether Isshin or Genichiro is a more impressive boss. Because Isshin is the exam, but Genichiro is what makes you LEARN.
[2:11:34] <%Amaideus> LolNashandra
[2:11:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie, USE YOUR EYES
[2:11:36] <%HeroToxiko> gotcha
[2:11:43] <nailwind> Living Failures theme is straight up amazing, it's so overlooked
[2:11:47] <%krispen_wa> ZA HANDO
[2:11:48] <Darren716> DS2's just sucks, Gywn has a reason at least
[2:11:49] <HarmlessCrow> DS2 is such a wet far of a final boss, even with Scholar installed
[2:11:53] <%X2Eliah> Jeses christ reggie TRY HIDING BRO
[2:12:02] <%X2Eliah> duh
[2:12:10] <$thomassolorio> maybe oldng upyur shild would elp
[2:12:12] <%X2Eliah> sorry
[2:12:12] <%emperordread> Eyes on the Inside
[2:12:14] <%krispen_wa> you know what boss was great? hobo man at the end of the world
[2:12:15] <Darren716> Reggie just dont get hit
[2:12:21] <mrblack499> try walking
[2:12:23] <%seniormeatbox> BIG FOG
[2:12:28] <Aydarkzero> just don't die 4Head
[2:12:29] <%Cozy90> ds1's boss i think is supposed to be more emotional if anything
[2:12:32] <+TopTieramisu> @krispen_wa red artorias?
[2:12:33] <HarmlessCrow> I am extremely happy with hobo man as the end of the series
[2:12:35] <BurdRightsActivist> Just got here, don't know how long you've been here, but you know maybe just change areas 4Head Kappa
[2:12:35] <linSP> there’s cover reggie!
[2:12:38] <+Deekman> why did Woolie turn in to The Riddler?
[2:12:40] <CappuccinoGuil> You want a hiding spot? Look for one
[2:12:45] <%krispen_wa> @toptieramisu Red Gattsu
[2:13:00] <andre11dr> Also everyone loves Ivory King, i think that boss i wack
[2:13:02] <BurdRightsActivist> What spell he got?
[2:13:03] <%krispen_wa> F
[2:13:08] <HarmlessCrow> The can of beans can be used as a hiding spot
[2:13:08] <%X2Eliah> poison cloud
[2:13:13] <+TopTieramisu> artorias was clearly based off of guts
[2:13:16] <%krispen_wa> Ivory King has a lightsaber, your arguments are invalid
[2:13:17] <+TopTieramisu> so yes, red artorias
[2:13:18] <waffleandman> holy shit those load times
[2:13:19] <+Colby_DJ> Guess and check
[2:13:19] <+Stormzcales_Lair> cuz its a puzzle booss, you have to riddler
[2:13:20] <SeniorTop> @AMUSERNAME Genichiro makes you learn and ISSHIN HAMMERS THE LESSON HOME.
[2:13:22] <GeoffGeofreed> Bean Dad Time!
[2:13:24] <%Amaideus> The Ivory King's the best character in the series (story wise I mean)
[2:13:27] <RamenRiderZ> THE BEAN GOD
[2:13:28] <Kghaleon> Why is Woolie sitting in the backseat right now?
[2:13:30] <Aydarkzero> @andre11dr he's alright but not the best the whole seal the portals to chaos bit is dumb
[2:13:33] <nailwind> @andre11dr yeah, it is kind of wack. feel like people love it mostly for the lore and opening
[2:13:44] <%krispen_wa> Is Artorias Blue guts? does that mean hobo man is red blue guts?
[2:13:45] <nailwind> cus ivory king is GOAT
[2:13:51] <%emperordread> What do the numbers mean Mason?
[2:13:52] <Aydarkzero> @krispen_wa yes
[2:13:55] <%X2Eliah> @Kghaleon Otherwise we could be here for weeks
[2:13:59] <HarmlessCrow> Bean God punches Reggarth every time he fails to educate himself on hiding
[2:14:00] <%Amaideus> Ivory King is like the only good king in the series
[2:14:05] <Aydarkzero> ^
[2:14:06] <%Amaideus> Big respect
[2:14:08] <nailwind> ^^
[2:14:23] <%Amaideus> Imagine being such a good dude you make the incarnation of fear and anxiety fall in love with you
[2:14:28] <%HeroToxiko> i wonder if those big fist weapons do anything to them rock barriers. i legit don't know because i quit demons a decade ago in the first zone
[2:14:29] <SeniorTop> Ivory king and Nameless king are pretty chill.
[2:14:30] <HarmlessCrow> @krispen_wa Purple guts you say?
[2:14:32] <+Deekman> why not put on a faster sword?
[2:14:34] <nailwind> Ivory King should get a dating sim harem
[2:14:37] <Josef_Stryker> What about Vendrick?
[2:14:40] <%Amaideus> Faster swords take more hits to break it
[2:14:41] <wantedsafe471> Ivory king best king
[2:14:44] <%Amaideus> Vendrick did a ton of fucked up shit
[2:14:46] <Josef_Stryker> I mean he kinda sucked at his job but he did try
[2:14:50] <%Amaideus> And didn't actually solve any of his problems
[2:14:52] <andre11dr> Ivory King has cool lore ,but i think his animations look dumb and the fight is not thst great
[2:14:53] <Aydarkzero> Vendrick is the Fool
[2:14:54] <Josef_Stryker> Oh yeah the giants war
[2:14:56] <%Amaideus> But outside of that he was a good dude
[2:14:56] <+Mendin> Not just a good dude, but enough of a badass that the invarnation of fear and anxiety FEELS SAFE BY YOUR SIDE
[2:15:00] <Belakitu> There are little pillers
[2:15:01] <%SouLucha> Surprised Reggie is sticking to such a big sword in a small place. Just asking to get walls-bounce backs.
[2:15:07] <%Amaideus> Vendrick is still pretty high tier by Souls standards
[2:15:07] <HarmlessCrow> Vendrick genocided a little bit I dunno
[2:15:13] <chaos4ever181> Ivory king had the coolest lore
[2:15:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:14] <DedlokPM> @Deekman faster sword = more hits to break anyway
[2:15:20] <andre11dr> But at least his better than THIS BOSS
[2:15:25] <%krispen_wa> Vendrick simped for Nashandra so he sucks
[2:15:32] <DedlokPM> so it evens out or this may even be faster
[2:15:33] <%Amaideus> To be fair
[2:15:37] <mrblack499> wait its red light green light or something
[2:15:38] <%Amaideus> She was kinda his wife
[2:15:41] <+Deekman> then would the thiefs ring work for this guy?
[2:15:45] <HarmlessCrow> Imagine simpling for a mediocre boss
[2:15:50] <Aydarkzero> chat is it okay to simp your wife? Kappa
[2:15:52] <nailwind> the only reason I even remember Vendrick is for his quote
[2:15:54] <chaos4ever181> Guy found a land on top of Chaos, and made a queen of the abyss turn good with his kindness
[2:15:55] <+yukichocomilk> with this kinda dumb boss I just go and read up LUL
[2:16:00] <+TopTieramisu> what's up with the daughter of manus looking like nito? ds2 man LUL
[2:16:06] <Aydarkzero> 'Seeker of Fire'
[2:16:08] <chaos4ever181> And she LOVED that
[2:16:09] <andre11dr> Allant is worst kind ease
[2:16:10] <+Colby_DJ> Hesitation is defeat
[2:16:11] <%Cozy90> oh shit eleven is coming to SF5? I might have to actually start playing SF5
[2:16:28] <MyNameIsRasus> Apathy is death
[2:16:29] <Josef_Stryker> Hesitation is Defeat
[2:16:30] <+TopTieramisu> who is eleven?
[2:16:32] <Belakitu> Duck under the hook
[2:16:32] <snivins> fear is the mind killer
[2:16:35] <%krispen_wa> does Isshin count as a king?
[2:16:38] <TheFramedWarlock> Hesitation is Defeat
[2:16:41] <SeniorTop> Honestly, he should try blocking that attack with the shield. Even if his poise gets broken, he will have more than enough time after to evade or hit the barrier.
[2:16:44] <%Cozy90> the prototype to twelve from third strike
[2:16:46] <Aydarkzero> more of a Lord than King
[2:16:47] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I'm late, but I made it!
[2:16:49] <%Amaideus> Yes he does count
[2:16:50] <Josef_Stryker> @TopTieramisu Basically the predecessor to Twelve from Third Strike
[2:16:51] <+Colby_DJ> Isshin is a lord
[2:16:54] <andre11dr> Even Gwin is a better King than Allant, he at least tried to save his world
[2:16:59] <%krispen_wa> Isshin is the coolest then
[2:17:00] <%Amaideus> Yes he's probably number 2 behind Ivory
[2:17:04] <Basic_Birch_> Remember Reggarth, hesitation is defeat!
[2:17:06] <Aydarkzero> isn't he retired in Sekiro though?
[2:17:09] <+TopTieramisu> @Josef_Stryker oh yeah, the wildly popular character twelve LUL
[2:17:11] <%Amaideus> I mean
[2:17:15] <%Amaideus> Mostly because he's old as fuck
[2:17:18] <%Amaideus> Like, in his 70's
[2:17:20] <%X2Eliah> did you?
[2:17:21] <%krispen_wa> When your waifu tells you to do the stupidest shit, yeah its simping
[2:17:24] <+Stormzcales_Lair> sprint
[2:17:25] <+Deekman> i don't think he's looking past the fence
[2:17:27] <%Cozy90> Twelve is actually my favorite character from SF
[2:17:27] <nailwind> eleven lookin like a dbz character
[2:17:29] <Visorak6> I legitimately dont understand why the fat pillar isnt a blind spot
[2:17:32] <SeniorTop> @Aydarkzero In the main ending, you fight his reincarnated at the peak of his strength.
[2:17:35] <+Colby_DJ> rawr
[2:17:39] <%Amaideus> "sword saint"
[2:17:39] <+Grayhammatter> rawr
[2:17:44] <%X2Eliah> @Visorak6 It really should be
[2:17:45] <Kghaleon> I bet it was really fun to play hide and seek with Reggie as a kid
[2:17:48] <%Amaideus> Strange sword
[2:17:54] <+TopTieramisu> twelve has a cool fighting style, but i would venture to say he wasn't particularly popular
[2:17:54] <andre11dr> @cozy90 He looks cool, but like YOUR FAVORITE?!
[2:17:58] <%Amaideus> That launches these tiny metal things at mer
[2:17:59] <Aydarkzero> @SeniorTop yeah and he's one tough old man god damn
[2:18:11] <Josef_Stryker> I can't wait to try out my main Nash after the update since he's among the batch being buffed for the Dan update
[2:18:17] <nailwind> Reggie is the kid who hides behind you during HidenSeek and thinks hes slick
[2:18:17] <+Deekman> @WoolieVersus does he have the thief ring on?
[2:18:22] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Reggie. You dodging right and then left so the strike comes straight at you
[2:18:23] <SeniorTop> @Aydarkzero Even as the non-sword saint, he is still pretty tough honestly.
[2:18:30] <%Cozy90> @andre11dr YES! I know he is not good AT ALL but i really love his design and appearance
[2:18:53] <brunoberserk> reggie is weak against one-hit kill punches like galactica phantom LUL
[2:18:54] <nailwind> seconding the Twelve stuff, he's a strong favorite
[2:18:58] <%krispen_wa> NOPE
[2:18:58] <wantedsafe471> STEALH
[2:19:08] <%krispen_wa> PROGRESSSSSS
[2:19:14] <Josef_Stryker> FUCK HIM UP
[2:19:15] <Johannen> Cheeeezd
[2:19:16] <%Amaideus> Dragon God a dumb
[2:19:19] <andre11dr> I wish he was better, he had like the best animations in 3S
[2:19:20] <%A_German_spy> Amazing karacoLOL
[2:19:21] <nailwind> ow my HIP
[2:19:22] <%HeroToxiko> He can't turn left LUL
[2:19:22] <%Amaideus> No object permanence
[2:19:24] <%Cozy90> @andre11dr although i love playing characters that can do something weird that no other characters can do reguardless of wether is good or not
[2:19:24] <Josef_Stryker> OW MY PUNCHING ARM
[2:19:25] <andre11dr> ALSO YEY
[2:19:27] <RamenRiderZ> DRAGONATOR
[2:19:28] <Belakitu> NOW HES PISSED
[2:19:31] <%X2Eliah> YOU DID IT REG
[2:19:35] <+krispen_wa> He doesnt even hit him in a vital organ. literally just the elbow
[2:19:36] <%X2Eliah> BOSS DEFEATED
[2:19:38] <+Grayhammatter> he's mad
[2:19:39] <Zayasu> this is a zelda boss Kappa
[2:19:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[2:19:46] <SeniorTop> Dragon God will remember that.
[2:20:00] <%RyTYoung> YE
[2:20:04] <%krispen_wa> I kinda like this boss theme remix
[2:20:06] <Tempmael> phase 1 get
[2:20:12] <Belakitu> Never know when safe
[2:20:21] <+Stormzcales_Lair> and passed a message he goes
[2:20:24] <%HeroToxiko> oh my god this was a gimmick boss the whole time LUL
[2:20:27] <Darren716> Is this like BoC where the progress saves?
[2:20:32] <%Amaideus> No
[2:20:36] <Darren716> fuck lol
[2:20:38] <%RyTYoung> @darren716 sadly no
[2:20:42] <%HeroToxiko> i wonder if he can see you if you're invisible
[2:20:43] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[2:20:52] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:20:53] <Aydarkzero> HOT FIRE
[2:20:55] <%Amaideus> BoC only does that because it was absolute horseshit without it and they ran out of time to make it better
[2:20:56] <wantedsafe471> roasted
[2:20:57] <+Grayhammatter> F
[2:20:58] <Darren716> That is the one compliment I'll give BoC over other shitty bosses
[2:20:59] <%Amaideus> Er
[2:20:59] <Kohei_kyouji> oh darn i missed flamelurker. well done reggie for getting past it

[2:22:21] <%Deekman> take my Prime
[2:22:26] <andre11dr> BoC is actually the worst Souls boss ever, she seems unfinished
[2:22:37] <%X2Eliah> phrasing
[2:22:40] <MyNameIsRasus> pull out god
[2:22:48] <+NanoComputer> pain
[2:22:49] <%Amaideus> Izalith in general is unfinished
[2:22:59] <Belakitu> Do spells break those pillers?
[2:23:02] <%krispen_wa> imagine if we fought BoC as the big cthulhu monster he was rather than a puzzle boss. it could have been so cool
[2:23:03] <%Lion_kun> reggie use your
[2:23:06] <%Deekman> @Belakitu yeah
[2:23:07] <%Lion_kun> overhand
[2:23:14] <%X2Eliah> woolieKICKDAD annoyed voice: "Are you gonna pull out?!"
[2:23:16] <%Deekman> put on thiefs ring and use magic
[2:23:17] <Visorak6> use R2
[2:23:19] <%Amaideus> There was a version of BoC that WAS a normal boss fight @krispen_wa
[2:23:28] <%Amaideus> Modders have found it, there's YT videos about it
[2:23:28] <mrblack499> use spear
[2:23:39] <RamenRiderZ> 👊 TwitchRPG Dodge this
[2:23:44] <%krispen_wa> @amaideus WHY DIDNT THEY KEEP IT
[2:23:54] <%Amaideus> Don't remember
[2:23:57] <%Amaideus> It wasn't finished
[2:24:09] <%HeroToxiko> @krispen_wa no time LUL
[2:24:10] <wantedsafe471> or bed of chaos, instead of pushing you into the floor after you remove the pillars, it got up and started moving around? the area seems large enough for that
[2:24:10] <%Amaideus> No idea why they moved to a shitty gimmick boss instead
[2:24:15] <%krispen_wa> and actual BoC was finished?
[2:24:16] <andre11dr> Chat when we get to Old Hero, pls no telling about thief ring, i actually like that boss way more without it
[2:24:25] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[2:24:29] <%X2Eliah> jesus
[2:24:30] <%Amaideus> I mean, BoC is functional

[2:24:50] <+Grayhammatter> get a different weapon?
[2:24:55] <Visorak6> Does thief ring help in this fight?
[2:25:00] <Johannen> This feels borked compared to OG
[2:25:00] <%Deekman> yeah
[2:25:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Bed Of Chaos learned from this and saved your progress between deaths
[2:25:10] <%Deekman> @Visorak6 yeah it does immensley
[2:25:14] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen This could happen in the OG too
[2:25:15] <andre11dr> @visorak6 Yes it does
[2:25:16] <%HeroToxiko> imagine if reggie died to drop damage instead LUL
[2:25:28] <Johannen> Most bosses seem a bit "off" honestly on this run
[2:25:29] <+0neReeler> pick a faster sword LUL
[2:25:35] <brunoberserk> this a gimmick boss, reggie , its not your fault
[2:25:43] <%krispen_wa> SPOOKED

[2:26:09] <%patriotrenegade> UR GOOD
[2:26:10] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:26:11] <%Amaideus> Ran out of stamina
[2:26:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> STILL GOOD!!!
[2:26:18] <Jaysky> I want a Dragon God to just punch me in the gut
[2:26:18] <wantedsafe471> Crazy talk activate!
[2:26:20] <+jiggy_snipe> lul
[2:26:22] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:26:29] <%patriotrenegade> can you here me now?
[2:26:30] <+TaylOctopus91> Lava breath is a cool dragon power
[2:26:37] <andre11dr> But hey at least the other gimmick boss this game offers is like the one of the bosses ever
[2:26:42] <GeoffGeofreed> Woolie got infected by Crazy Talk Requiem
[2:26:47] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus So Reggie have you played any stealth games?
[2:26:51] <+jiggy_snipe> Bring Me to Life upgraded and stole another stand's power
[2:26:57] <andre11dr> And i mean Storm King
[2:27:06] <Tuna_Can_0> did they say if Reggie would go through dark souls after Demon souls?
[2:27:19] <%HeroToxiko> can't punch if he can't see KEKW
[2:27:21] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus thanks!
[2:27:34] <MyNameIsRasus> @HeroToxiko say that to that other boss
[2:27:37] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:27:37] <%Amaideus> He said he wants to play DS1 after he's done DeS, but he also implied he'd be doing it on his own
[2:27:46] <%p4ntless> missed the start of the stream, has today just been reggie vs dragon god so far?
[2:27:51] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[2:27:55] <Tuna_Can_0> @Amaideus ah ok ty
[2:28:02] <%X2Eliah> mostly yeah, some weapon selection before that
[2:28:03] <Darthkitten_Prime> Red light green light
[2:28:08] <%krispen_wa> its a shame reggie stopped parrying. DS1 is half trivialized with parries
[2:28:08] <%Amaideus> He might do it on stream though, who knows
[2:28:11] <OblivionSword1> Patience is half the fight
[2:28:11] <%HeroToxiko> @MyNameIsRasus in the later games you needed the slumbering ring because enemies can hear you KEKW

[2:28:28] <MyNameIsRasus> KORONDA
[2:28:30] <brunoberserk> it a bullshit gimmick
[2:28:51] <%X2Eliah> So, by now Reggie has 100% all the info he needs... now i guess it's time to chill and let him win
[2:28:53] <%Amaideus> FUN GAMEPLAY
[2:29:01] <+0neReeler> Remember Snake, this is a sneaking mission
[2:29:02] <andre11dr> And once you beat it ,this boss becomes a fucking joke

[2:37:51] <Johannen> Block it?
[2:37:53] <%Amaideus> FUN BOSS
[2:37:57] <CappuccinoGuil> Your running attack has a start-up
[2:37:59] <%Amaideus> ENGAGING GAMEPLAY
[2:38:02] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah i'm with reggie on this one, this fight sucks
[2:38:05] <%X2Eliah> hmmm
[2:38:06] <+Rafraud> Best boss in game btw
[2:38:07] <andre11dr> You can't block it
[2:38:08] <+Rafraud> Kappa
[2:38:10] <%Deekman> would blocking help?
[2:38:13] <dundore77> i believe you can hide behind the pillar after the first blockade just if you trigger the punch it can still get you
[2:38:17] <%Amaideus> Warding would help
[2:38:17] <+deathscythe1287> @WoolieVersus Pat was having trouble with that as well
[2:38:17] <%X2Eliah> hmmmmmm.... can he shoot the clutter remotely?
[2:38:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Make sure to attack BEFORE you get to the blockade
[2:38:18] <%krispen_wa> youre with everyone in saying this boss sucks
[2:38:18] <roarofdamnation> Maybe with lighter equipment, naked and just the sword.
[2:38:21] <+Bearzone> lmao look at the floor
[2:38:22] <%X2Eliah> like arrow or magic
[2:38:25] <Jaysky> A mere mortal cannot hope to kill a GOD
[2:38:28] <%HeroToxiko> one hit blasts your stamina
[2:38:37] <Johannen> 70% with that shield, what about the other one?
[2:38:41] <HarmlessCrow> What an experience to follow up Flamelurker with THIS
[2:38:41] <+Stormzcales_Lair> MAGIK
[2:38:43] <%Deekman> He could shoot it with his fireball spell
[2:38:49] <%krispen_wa> @jaysky now a few arrows in the elbow on the other hand
[2:38:52] <Kohei_kyouji> @WoolieVersus does reggie have warding? i think its like a 70% phys damage resist
[2:38:54] <CureMode_> spells also work
[2:38:56] <roarofdamnation> But he has poison cloud equiped
[2:39:06] <Basic_Birch_> How about soul arrow?
[2:39:10] <%Deekman> i mean it's 2 seconds to warp to the nexus and put back on the fireball
[2:39:11] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Oi
[2:39:25] <Smokin_Fish> ripperoni my boi
[2:39:44] <+Derbisol> literally every time
[2:39:47] <CureMode_> equip fireball you got that fast ssd
[2:39:47] <wantedsafe471> reattune spell?
[2:39:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Try Soul Ray
[2:39:51] <%jepupu> One. Step. At. A. Time.
[2:39:51] <MyNameIsRasus> spy spare this soul
[2:39:58] <+TaylOctopus91> Maybe a faster swinging weapon?
[2:40:05] <andre11dr> Reggie might want to consider switching to a faster weapon here
[2:40:11] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus go back and equip the fireball. It's a 1 minute trip
[2:40:11] <+TaylOctopus91> That doesn't eat as much stamina
[2:40:16] <dundore77> the spot reggie said not here should work iirc its just they were already triggered and swinging for the spot before reggie went
[2:40:17] <SeniorTop> Honestly, he should try blocking at least once. It might be what he needs.
[2:40:19] <%Amaideus> Faster weapons take multiple hits
[2:40:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Should I be "One Guy" again and suggest another area? LUL /s
[2:40:24] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Check Discord
[2:40:25] <+Derbisol> kill the crystal bug to build confidence
[2:40:25] <Kohei_kyouji> its the running as soon as youre caught that gets you killed. stay still behind yuor cover before he roars a second time and he calms down
[2:40:31] <+Rafraud> @WoolieVersus When he yells he has seen you, but if you stop moving he won't punch. He will punch on the second yell if he noticed you
[2:40:33] <%X2Eliah> there may be is no next spot?
[2:40:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @A_German_spy our savior!
[2:40:40] <+0neReeler> columns by sega
[2:40:47] <CureMode_> also equip theifs ring
[2:40:48] <MyNameIsRasus> spy with discord tips
[2:40:51] <+TaylOctopus91> @amaideus Ah, figures. My b
[2:41:01] <CappuccinoGuil> Spy is giving you discord tips
[2:41:11] <MyNameIsRasus> bad timing
[2:41:15] <+b_aleph> LUL
[2:41:15] <xeros720> that was a warning punch,
[2:41:24] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus Woo!
[2:41:24] <nailwind> these are desperate times
[2:41:29] <+Rafraud> So like if he notices you and you stop moving and hide behind a spot, he will not swing
[2:41:30] <%krispen_wa> try Warding?
[2:41:31] <+MisleadingEchoes> terrible fight
[2:41:31] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus No need to apologize!
[2:41:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Will that work?
[2:41:34] <%X2Eliah> Yeah no this feels like big jank
[2:41:35] <andre11dr> LUL
[2:41:41] <nailwind> do not tug on my heartstrings like that reggie
[2:41:49] <+eanscrale> This boss has always been a let down easy or hard.
[2:41:50] <DeathByPoke7> does thief ring work i forget
[2:41:50] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This fight isn't exactly the best design
[2:41:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's really not that bad, it's just a gimmick
[2:41:59] <Jaysky> For real though yeah this boss has always been jank
[2:42:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe use a quicker weapon
[2:42:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Faster weapon, soul ray/flame toss
[2:42:10] <%ZweihanderSteve> i forgot how bizarre the dragon god js
[2:42:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> Faster weapon is best
[2:42:14] <CappuccinoGuil> Get those two things
[2:42:15] <+0neReeler> people didn't like this boss
[2:42:16] <LunarRemix> It's the first of it's design
[2:42:16] <nailwind> this is the ''we dont talk about this'' boss
[2:42:18] <%Lion_kun> My strat was having a billion grass and power through.
[2:42:22] <+eanscrale> It's better than the Bed of Chaos... I guess.
[2:42:27] <%kewlmyc> One of the worst bosses in the series for various reasons
[2:42:32] <peachy996> Is it better or worse that it looks so cool?
[2:42:32] <MyNameIsRasus> thank god they never tried anything like this ever again right? Kappa
[2:42:32] <linSP> try sprint attack with a large weapon
[2:42:32] <Jaysky> It is a cool design though
[2:42:33] <@Solidus_113> It's times like this when a "Remake" should modernize the jank. But not this time
[2:42:36] <dundore77> reggies running past the 2nd safe spot as he's seen and thats triggering the grab as soon as he destroys the rubble
[2:42:38] <%Amaideus> Worse for sure
[2:42:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not not well designed
[2:42:46] <+0neReeler> you have to roll cancel the attack
[2:42:47] <Johannen> @Lion_kun Same, I always play big bois and i just tanked and blocked most his hits
[2:42:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Edging huh?
[2:42:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's not great but it's certainly not bed of chaos dude
[2:42:50] <%Amaideus> Cool design wasted on a shit bos
[2:42:53] <+Mendin> Maybe the Defense spell from that boss soul?
[2:42:54] <+Rafraud> @WoolieVersus The window of you having time to hide between him yelling and him swinging is super tight. But basically it goes, if he notices you, you have like half a second to stop and hide behind a pillar. If you stopped, he will not swing
[2:42:58] <+Mendin> To tank his punches harder?
[2:43:03] <HarmlessCrow> How exactly does Bluepoint fix this boss without wildly changing it?
[2:43:05] <%Deekman> soul arrow is perfect
[2:43:07] <CappuccinoGuil> There's a pillar right between the 2 rubbles. Stop there
[2:43:11] <%X2Eliah> So so far Reggie's not finding the 2nd safe spot, or the 2nd safe spot is bugged somehow
[2:43:15] <SeniorTop> @Solidus_113 I admire then for remaking basically the original experience. But yeah, they should have fixed atleast this gimmick boss.
[2:43:17] <+jiggy_snipe> nothing is as bad as the BoC. RNG nonsense over there, at least he's just a puzzle
[2:43:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's just not finding it
[2:43:22] <%Amaideus> Let the rubble stay destroyed between attempts
[2:43:34] <HarmlessCrow> Fair point
[2:43:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:43:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea, this is just a timing puzzle. It's really not that bad
[2:43:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember: DeS has sound detection
[2:43:36] <%RyTYoung> You can hide from his gaze from behind jt
[2:43:39] <Visorak6> Its because reggie always twitches when he sits still
[2:43:39] <ronin19xx> Back any highlights I missed?
[2:43:42] <%krispen_wa> @harmlesscrow when you get to the boss arena he's already in his final phase dying. there, boss fixed
[2:43:53] <Jaysky> Oh I'll take this over bed of chaos any day
[2:43:57] <Kohei_kyouji> @X2Eliah its not bugged, but the fact that reggie keeps running as soon as hes spotted gets him killed. if he'd stay still before the god roars a second time, hed be safe
[2:44:04] <%X2Eliah> ah
[2:44:07] <nailwind> @ronin19xx Reggie broke the game a while ago
[2:44:13] <%ozzrabbit> Hey, does the binoculars trick work in this game, or is the spyglass not a useful aiming option?
[2:44:18] <+Checktrap> Safe spot seems to only he safe from sight not from the punch
[2:44:20] <MyNameIsRasus> @HarmlessCrow make it more clear where the blindsposts are and make his view a spotlight you can see
[2:44:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Just equip the battle axe or something faster
[2:44:26] <ronin19xx> Oh wow how? Lol
[2:44:27] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[2:44:32] <HarmlessCrow> @krispen_wa Change name to "Sad Dying Dragon". Honestly I wouldn't even be mad beating was such a low in my playthrough
[2:44:32] <+0neReeler> had to run and slash the rubble and hide few times to break it
[2:44:35] <Visorak6> He keeps moving when DG roars
[2:44:41] <+Stormzcales_Lair> use safe spot to try the stop
[2:44:42] <+Rafraud> That was the first yell @WoolieVersus
[2:44:45] <nailwind> @ronin19xx somehow clipped into the third phase of the boss and got stuck
[2:44:49] <+Rafraud> Watch for second yell
[2:45:06] <Jaysky> Imagine if this God took up boxing lessons
[2:45:10] <+0neReeler> large columns
[2:45:18] <ronin19xx> Daaaaamn he was close
[2:45:20] <nailwind> 100 dragon god jabs a second if he had lessons
[2:45:30] <ronin19xx> Thanks man
[2:45:31] <CappuccinoGuil> The archway is safe
[2:45:41] <Kohei_kyouji> ^
[2:45:42] <Visorak6> run to the archway and dead stop behind it
[2:45:51] <CappuccinoGuil> STAND
[2:45:53] <+0neReeler> pillar doesn't block damage
[2:45:55] <roarofdamnation> Isn't Reggie kind of luminous right now?
[2:45:56] <%X2Eliah> STAND
[2:45:58] <+Stormzcales_Lair> reggie kept moving
[2:46:04] <dundore77> he's too far to the right
[2:46:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE LUL
[2:46:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Rafraud
[2:46:10] <Jaysky> P A N I K
[2:46:15] <+Rafraud> my b
[2:46:15] <OblivionSword1> Reggie be patience
[2:46:17] <%RyTYoung> FURTHER
[2:46:20] <nailwind> @Rafraud robbed LUL
[2:46:24] <%RyTYoung> STAY
[2:46:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Against the pillar KISS it
[2:46:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> LUL
[2:46:32] <DedlokPM> @ronin19xx Clip of the clipping. He couldn't do anything and the monster could not see him/attack him. had to die to get out https://clips.twitch.tv/FlirtyNaiveNewtDancingBaby--gv1EKMGTAw8jcJe
[2:46:33] <Tempmael> found it
[2:46:34] <+0neReeler> you can but he was running about
[2:46:39] <+Bearzone> stop panicking
[2:46:41] <+Rafraud> @WoolieVersus you are right, if he yells again, and you are behind a pillar, do not move. Just hide
[2:46:45] <%Deekman> look at the floor there's a big round rock
[2:46:47] <Visorak6> I think theres a marker on the floor
[2:46:50] <+Grayhammatter> Edge
[2:47:06] <CappuccinoGuil> You have to use these archways to hide
[2:47:09] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[2:47:11] <roarofdamnation> XD
[2:47:12] <%X2Eliah> well almost
[2:47:13] <+Bearzone> thats it
[2:47:14] <Zayasu> LUL
[2:47:16] <MyNameIsRasus> should've gone back
[2:47:17] <+Grayhammatter> clipped, oof
[2:47:20] <andre11dr> That was weird
[2:47:27] <KgKid51> this fight suuccks lol
[2:47:28] <%Deekman> if you walk slowly will he hear you?
[2:47:29] <Visorak6> Yeah I think there's a circular stone spot behind the archway that is the safe spot marker
[2:47:29] <+0neReeler> now this is hard part
[2:47:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Hide, run, clear, go back, hide, repeat
[2:47:38] <+Bucklord96> FUCK
[2:47:39] <%Pillagius> I'm not an expert but isn't the point to just destroy the rubble, in which case - can you use fast weapon?
[2:47:44] <OblivionSword1> HAVE CONFIDENCE
[2:47:44] <+Rafraud> Boss is bad
[2:47:54] <%X2Eliah> fast weapon couldbe too weak
[2:47:56] <dundore77> faster weapons take more hits
[2:47:58] <LunarRemix> Wasn't there another ring that helps with this boss fight alonside Thief's?
[2:48:03] <DedlokPM> @Pillagius fast weapons take more hits to clear
[2:48:07] <+0neReeler> heavy weapon can break and run, weak weapon hit and return
[2:48:08] <Basic_Birch_> Reggie is ascending
[2:48:13] <%Frazzyfraznor> Hey guys
[2:48:20] <Jaysky> @lunarremix Yes,the Elden ring
[2:48:22] <nailwind> how good is the tracking on the punch anyways, or the aoe is too big anyways
[2:48:28] <$thomassolorio> twitches get stiches
[2:48:29] <Kohei_kyouji> the boss sucks but the way theyre playing is making it look a lot worse than it actually is sadly
[2:48:36] <%X2Eliah> REGGIE STOP TWITCHING IN THE HIDING SPOTS
[2:48:39] <PanicSwytch> Reggie is learning but still I sense some panic
[2:48:43] <LunarRemix> @Jaysky Booooo
[2:48:48] <OblivionSword1> Miss
[2:48:50] <%Frazzyfraznor> My fav stream of the week!
[2:48:52] <+Bearzone> fear lol
[2:48:53] <%Pillagius> @DedlokPM well, yeah, but normally they swing about twice faster.
[2:49:12] <%Amaideus> Yo what is Reggie's skin care routine, he's glowing RN :^)
[2:49:20] <+0neReeler> swing and a miss
[2:49:35] <mrblack499> if this was nioh i would understand
[2:49:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's incredibly useful. Especially against LIVING THINGS.
[2:49:42] <VoraciousKain> speaking of glowing, is the sun getting in reggies eyes?
[2:49:44] <%Pillagius> @Amaideus he's in the middle of DBZ-style power up
[2:49:52] <nailwind> reggarth is ascending
[2:50:02] <MyNameIsRasus> in a few hours the sun will rise
[2:50:06] <%RyTYoung> GOD REGGARTH VS DRAGON GOD
[2:50:19] <nailwind> thou holiness
[2:50:19] <%Amaideus> No wonder he can't see, he has the sun in his eyes! :^)
[2:50:23] <Hayateilolol> monkaS
[2:50:23] <+b_aleph> rEGGARTH THE sHINING
[2:50:25] <DedlokPM> @Pillagius if it swings twice as fast and takes 2 hits, then it takes the same amount of time. technically more if you have to hit, run back, then hit and run back again
[2:50:31] <%SouLucha> SUNSHINE
[2:50:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> REGGARTH THE BOSSBREAKER
[2:50:31] <Basic_Birch_> Don't go to the light Reggie!
[2:50:32] <VoraciousKain> much better
[2:50:34] <%RyTYoung> ye
[2:50:34] <andre11dr> Now Reggie has lost his SSJ powers
[2:50:38] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[2:50:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19
[2:50:39] <nailwind> back to the dark side
[2:50:46] <%Frazzyfraznor> Praise the sun dont block it
[2:50:50] <%RyTYoung> Solaire is sad BibleThump
[2:50:52] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus
[2:50:54] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[2:50:55] <nailwind> attack the sun when its weak
[2:51:05] <Kiras86> T'es pourri Reggie... lol
[2:51:10] <ronin19xx> There is a third spot no?
[2:51:11] <+kewlmyc> magic and bows really help with this shit boss
[2:51:16] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Use the rolling two-handed R1 to break the rubble. It's faster.
[2:51:17] <emeraldskrull> "he saw me" "Yes."
[2:51:26] <mrblack499> if were taking shots per death you would have died at this point
[2:51:41] <andre11dr> The sun can suck it ,the moon is way cooler, it turns red and shit
[2:51:46] <%Pillagius> @DedlokPM yeah. that's sort of what I had in mind. Running back and forth is a bit longer but certainly faster than restarting whole fight over and over
[2:51:46] <+0neReeler> go back is roll and sprint as fast as possible, there's barely enough time
[2:52:01] <+Bucklord96> So slap the second pillar and then run back past the second safe spot and come back?
[2:52:04] <%SouLucha> WHERE'S MY DRAGONATOR?!
[2:52:13] <Darthkitten_Prime> Glad to see the term "Dragonator" used outside of Monster Hunter
[2:52:22] <%X2Eliah> nah, slap the second pillar and roll and gtfo forward
[2:52:36] <Kohei_kyouji> its like woolie is trying to shout over the dragong od
[2:52:37] <Basic_Birch_> There is no news for elden ring today
[2:52:39] <Kohei_kyouji> *dragon god
[2:52:50] <GeoffGeofreed> Yo! We need a Demon's Soul X MH crossover!
[2:52:58] <%Deekman> Rolling R1 was the BEST advice
[2:53:07] <MyNameIsRasus> GERMAN SPY SAVES THE STREAM
[2:53:19] <wantedsafe471> Thank you German Spy!
[2:53:20] <andre11dr> Dragon God confirmed for MH Rise
[2:53:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Rolling R1 was GODLIKE
[2:53:33] <%Lion_kun> I like how woolz has given up
[2:53:37] <nailwind> we learning
[2:53:44] <%Deekman> @A_German_spy if he's got the thief ring and he walks slowly will it make a difference?
[2:53:44] <andre11dr> Actually no fuck that, give me Abraitas in MH
[2:53:49] <Aydarkzero> PAWNCH
[2:53:50] <MyNameIsRasus> spam roll
[2:53:51] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Almost.
[2:53:57] <wantedsafe471> darn
[2:53:58] <Kohei_kyouji> you stopped
[2:53:59] <Jaysky> Flash bombs would be useful here
[2:53:59] <GeoffGeofreed> Thx Germanspy. Reggie doesn't need suffer anymore of this crap
[2:54:00] <%Lion_kun> Not complaining. This boss sucks
[2:54:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> faster
[2:54:03] <mrblack499> some set a timer
[2:54:04] <ronin19xx> The is athird spot
[2:54:09] <Aydarkzero> where's my DRAGONATOR
[2:54:10] <nailwind> the next rubble
[2:54:11] <KgKid51> spam roll btw
[2:54:19] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS IS NOT REALLY REGGIE'S FAULT
[2:54:30] <+Rafraud> The boss is ass its ok
[2:54:31] <+0neReeler> swing is still too slow
[2:54:41] <Kohei_kyouji> part reggie, but mostly the boss
[2:54:47] <wantedsafe471> yeah not reggies fault. this boss isnt great
[2:54:49] <%HeroToxiko> 2009 boss is 2009 boss
[2:54:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Glitching through the arena? Not your fault
[2:54:54] <%Frazzyfraznor> I didnt notice any difference with the thief ring
[2:54:55] <GeoffGeofreed> This is just the first BoC type boss.
[2:55:03] <andre11dr> The sucks, but i feel like it shouldn't suck this hard
[2:55:06] <ronin19xx> Dragon God is a failure of the game designer
[2:55:08] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That was good. Almost had it. After you break the second rubble with the rolling R1, you just have to keep mashing rolls toward the Dragonator.
[2:55:12] <Necnill> "First time I did it raw completely, getting lucky was absolutely part of it..."
[2:55:18] <Kohei_kyouji> it doesnt @andre11dr
[2:55:24] <nailwind> the fact that BoC exists means there were enough sociopaths left after demon's souls
[2:55:26] <%psydaku> @Necnill oh myy
[2:55:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Dragonator sounds like a Phineas and Ferb thing
[2:55:36] <+SouLucha> I like Reggie's reaction to all this, good at keeping strong and chill about all this. Most people I feel would break. woolieKICKDAD SeemsGood
[2:55:39] <Aydarkzero> hide your meat cleaver Kappa
[2:55:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> magic pixel
[2:55:56] <wantedsafe471> magic pixel
[2:55:57] <+jdjackson31> I had to be a human and use warding to make it through this section.
[2:56:00] <MyNameIsRasus> THERE IS NO CLEAN MANNER
[2:56:01] <Style_train_14> Hi woolie hi reggie
[2:56:03] <nailwind> as long as it works, reggie boy
[2:56:06] <+Grayhammatter> that magic pixel
[2:56:13] <%X2Eliah> so now it's one by one
[2:56:15] <%Lion_kun> How come Bluepoint couldn't fix this garbage?
[2:56:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dude this fight seems jank af
[2:56:17] <+yukichocomilk> dragon god is a dirty boy
[2:56:19] <nailwind> god gave you this pixel, pixel you will use
[2:56:19] <Kiras86> omg
[2:56:20] <+eanscrale> There is, but it's somehow even less satisfying.
[2:56:20] <%X2Eliah> YEAH BOOF TO NEXUS NOW
[2:56:21] <+Derbisol> you get in the filth
[2:56:23] <%jepupu> 草
[2:56:26] <glass_marcus> This boss doesn't deserve to be dealt with cleanly
[2:56:29] <%X2Eliah> WARP TO NEXUS NOW GOOD IDEA
[2:56:30] <LunarRemix> Put the regenerator ring on
[2:56:30] <+0neReeler> we'll take it
[2:56:34] <Visorak6> Regardless a tap from this guy will kill you down here
[2:56:35] <Tempmael> could swap for regen and wait
[2:56:41] <Tempmael> then back to theif
[2:56:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Health is binary here
[2:56:54] <andre11dr> Iea they never really tried this after BoC ,the closest we got was the Tree and Walnir but those bosses are fine
[2:56:58] <MyNameIsRasus> You either have 0 or anything else
[2:57:04] <mrblack499> just talk
[2:57:06] <+0neReeler> doesn't matter about health it's instakill
[2:57:14] <wantedsafe471> so close
[2:57:18] <+Grayhammatter> regen ring?
[2:57:31] <%SouLucha> Learning his tells, learning the layout using your opportunities well... Yeah this feels like a Souls boss, it just sucks.
[2:57:38] <linSP> he can’t see you when he screams in pain
[2:57:41] <+Derbisol> god stop correcting
[2:57:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:57:45] <Style_train_14> Proto Bed of Chaos
[2:57:48] <+Bucklord96> If he makes it to the final part and dies from the nose steam I’m going to fucking cry
[2:57:50] <GeoffGeofreed> The Tree was actually fun and Wolnir was anticlimactic

[2:59:18] <+0neReeler> almost
[2:59:23] <dundore77> its not bad once you get the idea of the boss
[2:59:29] <dundore77> but not fun
[2:59:33] <+Rafraud> It truly is a bad mechanic
[2:59:34] <+jiggy_snipe> I feel like Reggie will die from a very goofy thing if he's low on life at the end
[2:59:34] <%kyh9> Thats a big sword for a Dex character
[2:59:35] <%jepupu> You moved
[2:59:35] <GeoffGeofreed> OK it's almost there, we need Reggie to move on to actually bosses.
[2:59:36] <+0neReeler> puzzlegod
[2:59:44] <+Grayhammatter> moved
[2:59:50] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You had already triggered the attack there.
[2:59:52] <atema128> Hell yeah more ReggieVS!
[2:59:55] <mrblack499> so i got it right lol
[2:59:56] <%X2Eliah> So the "1st safe spot" in Reggie's mind is too far ahead
[3:00:06] <%kyh9> Dont notice the big sword
[3:00:17] <MyNameIsRasus> i think spy said the direction he's looking is irrelevant
[3:00:33] <+Derbisol> HES LEARNING
[3:00:34] <Style_train_14> I really love the visual design on this boss
[3:00:38] <+Derbisol> GO REGGIE!
[3:00:40] <%A_German_spy> @MyNameIsRasus It is. But Reggie has enough info to be able to do this.

[3:01:17] <%kyh9> EXPELLIARMUS
[3:01:19] <xeros720> to the person that asked about quick weapons, that's the issue
[3:01:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Now you have learned

[3:07:44] <+Bucklord96> Please kill him now I can’t take the stress
[3:07:47] <%HeroToxiko> @wolfen091 the souls series is largely based on berserk
[3:07:50] <Kohei_kyouji> this boss for me is just 'free souls'. i do 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, and then this. sends me to such a high level early on
[3:07:58] <%SouLucha> LUL
[3:08:00] <$thomassolorio> so fresh and so clean clean
[3:08:04] <+paladinstarbuster> of course
[3:08:05] <Necnill> Don't get cocky
[3:08:06] <%X2Eliah> try it out
[3:08:06] <BurdRightsActivist> OPEN THOSE BEANS
[3:08:10] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus One at a time. Don't push it. karacoLOL
[3:08:10] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why risk it
[3:08:11] <Kohei_kyouji> since this difficulty is binary
[3:08:12] <+Grayhammatter> don't get cocky
[3:08:12] <+Dayube> cleeaaaan
[3:08:12] <%X2Eliah> die on this one, try again
[3:08:13] <+Derbisol> THE AROGANCE!
[3:08:13] <VoraciousKain> the souls series suffered because of idol master
[3:08:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Really

[3:08:38] <andre11dr> @tayloctopus91 That ,and getting the stuff they missed in 2-2
[3:08:40] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yes, the head doesn't matter. When you're in his line of sight, you have a set time limit before he acts.
[3:08:41] <+Derbisol> go fast eat ass
[3:08:44] <%X2Eliah> man this boss is so jank
[3:08:55] <mark_collins45> The blinking animation on the Dragon is cool.
[3:09:07] <%krispen_wa> Man his head reset animation is baaaad
[3:09:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So the longer you're in his field of vision, the more danger you're in.
[3:09:16] <+0neReeler> use the nose to see when he's looking away
[3:09:20] <@Solidus_113> dude has like 8 eyes
[3:09:29] <nailwind> ohhh, he was getting very angyyy
[3:09:30] <%HeroToxiko> a fist to surpass metal gear
[3:09:34] <Kohei_kyouji> do not turn back after you break!
[3:09:35] <@Solidus_113> His FOV must be crazy
[3:09:38] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah! Keep going!
[3:09:40] <MyNameIsRasus> keep going, don't come back
[3:09:41] <Darren716> But can he see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch?

[3:12:08] <$USOtaku> Well done Reggie
[3:12:09] <VoraciousKain> don't die
[3:12:10] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Don't worry about it, Woolie. This is a GARBAGE fight.
[3:12:11] <+Rafraud> Get ready for more of that
[3:12:12] <%JaseAdrift> LMAO that was so close
[3:12:13] <mrblack499> wow almost gave the win away lol
[3:12:14] <+0neReeler> magic pixel
[3:12:18] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie is speaking truths
[3:12:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Woolie sounded like a mom wanting Reggie to get a big spider LUL
[3:12:24] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus This fight is SUPER obtuse
[3:12:31] <%Deekman> be careful he's got a body now
[3:12:36] <%JaseAdrift> @A_German_spy if you can even call it a fight
[3:12:40] <andre11dr> Good job Reggie, thst was the first archdemon kill
[3:12:54] <%Deekman> i'm more scared he'll fall off a ledge lol
[3:12:55] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus And you know what? I also spent 3 hours on this fight the first time I did it. Couldn't figure out the mechanics.
[3:12:58] <nailwind> big win
[3:13:00] <%RyTYoung> SO TURN AROUND
[3:13:11] <mrblack499> in short get good lol
[3:13:11] <MyNameIsRasus> AND FEEL THE WIND BLOW
[3:13:11] <andre11dr> Luckily all the other Archdemons are WAY BETTER
[3:13:14] <moonmintparadise> PLEASE JUST SAY BEHIND YOU
[3:13:14] <+paladinstarbuster> obtuse mechanics like break rubble and hide
[3:13:27] <%Chatterbox1991> Who sung that song again?
[3:13:31] <%Chatterbox1991> Turn Around?
[3:13:37] <nailwind> o p t i m a l
[3:13:40] <RamenRiderZ> MASTER, MASTER
[3:13:43] <%HeroToxiko> woolieYE woolieYE
[3:13:44] <DatAsuna> The MARTH ring
[3:13:48] <DatAsuna> Real tipper hours
[3:13:51] <GeoffGeofreed> Welp that was a lot stressful than I thought but now it's finally over.
[3:13:52] <snivins> Elden ring confirmed rbzP
[3:13:52] <+paladinstarbuster> such a cool ring
[3:13:53] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So this ring increases "sweet spot" damage. Only applies to weapons like axes, hammers and the Meat Cleaver.
[3:13:57] <Josef_Stryker> Oh did Reggie do it?
[3:13:59] <Josef_Stryker> I left for a bit
[3:14:01] <%X2Eliah> Literally the "Get Good" ring
[3:14:02] <dinnydanny777> Just be skilful
[3:14:04] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen He did
[3:14:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Chatterbox1991 Total Eclipse of the Heart?
[3:14:10] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo neat
[3:14:18] <%Chatterbox1991> that the singer?
[3:14:18] <%Lion_kun> Bed of Chaos is not as bad as Dragon God
[3:14:25] <%krispen_wa> lies
[3:14:26] <DatAsuna> reggie is too used to fox, doesn't have those marth chops
[3:14:28] <%Lion_kun> BoC has checkpoints
[3:14:29] <Sunstalker> Just don't shit with the base of your weapon, It's not hard, Reggie/Woolie
[3:14:36] <%HeroToxiko> if only you could mod in more ring slots
[3:14:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Not only that it would be a damage decrease for any non optimal hit
[3:14:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @Chatterbox1991 No that's the song. Bonnie Tyler is the singer
[3:14:47] <+paladinstarbuster> did reggie ever get the strength ring?
[3:14:50] <Josef_Stryker> Bed of Chaos has checkpoints at least but it's so random
[3:14:54] <andre11dr> BoD is worst than Dragon God ,it actually feels unfinished
[3:15:11] <%Chatterbox1991> i know she died recently, unfortunately
[3:15:13] <%Chatterbox1991> rip
[3:15:14] <%krispen_wa> dragon god also doesnt have a shitty boss run
[3:15:16] <mrblack499> so all roads lead to get good?
[3:15:24] <Sunstalker> Bed of Chaos is absolutely worse because of going through the level
[3:15:32] <%bread_assassin> DeS has a lot of gimmick bosses in retrospect.
[3:15:34] <+Rafraud> The game is OLD
[3:15:36] <nailwind> release the hatred, reggie
[3:15:38] <ronin19xx> Failure of the game designer
[3:15:38] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus he can now fast travel between zones from any archstone to!
[3:15:40] <%Frazzyfraznor> Has Reggie been invaded yet?
[3:15:47] <%Chatterbox1991> Not Bonnie Taylor the woman who did the cover
[3:15:49] <+TaylOctopus91> She's doing the little kicks!! 😍😍
[3:15:50] <Visorak6> Its because the cues are not very well made
[3:15:56] <+DonnyJaBronie> true
[3:16:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Dark Souls 2 that's like half of them
[3:16:04] <@Solidus_113> What's BB's?
[3:16:05] <MyNameIsRasus> DS2 has like 5
[3:16:07] <SeniorTop> Who is the really poorly designed boss in DS2?
[3:16:08] <+Stormzcales_Lair> who is the BB base one ?
[3:16:15] <%krispen_wa> @solidus_113 defiled amygdala?
[3:16:15] <dundore77> I dont think dragon god is horrible. its just the first trick boss and its kinda finicky on where it can see you behind pillars
[3:16:15] <Tempmael> it's a setpiece boss
[3:16:15] <Kohei_kyouji> rom?
[3:16:16] <%nintega010> Cool looking boss though
[3:16:17] <+ColonelHandzLanza> No there is not. After 2 they nailed it
[3:16:17] <andre11dr> It's kinda crazy to think that Dragon God and Storm King are in the same game
[3:16:18] <%Chatterbox1991> @SeniorTop most of them?
[3:16:19] <%X2Eliah> UNO MUCHACHO BOSS
[3:16:22] <moonmintparadise> which boss is it in DS 2 ?
[3:16:22] <wantedsafe471> what did i missed while i was gone?
[3:16:26] <Josef_Stryker> Royal Rat Authority imo
[3:16:28] <%Amaideus> ds2 has a bunch of bosses that really shouldn't be bosses
[3:16:30] <+paladinstarbuster> do magic
[3:16:32] <Kohei_kyouji> @moonmintparadise most of them lol
[3:16:32] <%SouLucha> Yeah, which is the bad boss in BB?
[3:16:36] <%patriotrenegade> Almost every boss in DS2
[3:16:38] <%Chatterbox1991> Do you count Orphan of Kos as poorly designed?
[3:16:38] <mrblack499> DS2 whole game has trash
[3:16:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Pop some souls to finally get that slot
[3:16:39] <%X2Eliah> gaskwang?
[3:16:40] <moonmintparadise> DS3 the Deacons are so bad
[3:16:41] <Kohei_kyouji> @moonmintparadise maybe the royal rats are the worst
[3:16:41] <SeniorTop> @Chatterbox1991 Hard disagree, i think all of them are perfectly fine. With some real standouts.
[3:16:45] <Josef_Stryker> I love DS2 but that games is way too bloated
[3:16:46] <DatAsuna> Lawrence is real bad in BB
[3:16:46] <%Amaideus> Deacons are fine
[3:16:47] <%krispen_wa> Orphan of Kos is one of the best designed
[3:16:47] <+Bearzone> Rom
[3:16:47] <%patriotrenegade> Uhhh, Witch of Hemwick is kind of weak
[3:16:52] <moonmintparadise> rats and rat related dogs are the worst
[3:16:52] <%Amaideus> They're not hard, but they're well designed
[3:16:55] <peachy996> The bad bosses reside in Chalice Dungeons imo
[3:16:56] <roarofdamnation> one level away
[3:16:59] <%Chatterbox1991> i love the Deacons
[3:17:00] <RamenRiderZ> Screw Royal Rat, stupid upscaled dog
[3:17:01] <Josef_Stryker> Laurence is arguably BS
[3:17:05] <DatAsuna> Micolash and Rom just suck too
[3:17:06] <%SouLucha> Yeah seems people just needed to git gud in BB.
[3:17:10] <SeniorTop> I guess the most gimmicky fight would be Duke's Dearest Freja.
[3:17:13] <%krispen_wa> Pthumerian Descendant is cancer
[3:17:14] <@Solidus_113> Laurence did suck
[3:17:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Laurence sucks and is just asset reuse
[3:17:16] <andre11dr> @datasuna I'd say the Witches
[3:17:19] <Visorak6> dragon god is firestorm right?
[3:17:23] <peachy996> Isz version of Ebrietas is annoying with her charge
[3:17:24] <DatAsuna> @SouLucha No, people just need to not conflate the word "bad" with "hard"
[3:17:26] <mrblack499> rom is not as bad as kos
[3:17:29] <chaos4ever181> You...did it
[3:17:35] <DatAsuna> The worst bosses are usually the easiest
[3:17:37] <MyNameIsRasus> @SeniorTop Even Congregation? Royal Rat Authority?
[3:17:37] <%SouLucha> I hunted Laurence for fun.
[3:17:38] <%patriotrenegade> Rom is awful in Cursed chalices
[3:17:40] <peachy996> Laurence is tough but doable
[3:17:41] <wantedsafe471> does running firestorm still work?
[3:17:49] <%ChoculaUltra> Touch the demon inside me monkaS
[3:17:53] <%krispen_wa> uwu
[3:17:54] <Kohei_kyouji> Demons souls - Dragon God. Dark souls - Bed of chaos. DS2 - Royal rats? DS3 - Archdrake. Bloodborne - Rom. Sekiro - uhh...the monkeys?
[3:17:55] <%Amaideus> He called her Skeet Face
[3:17:56] <Ner234> Reggie LUL
[3:17:56] <%patriotrenegade> Ebrietas' hitbox when she charges is broken imo
[3:17:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> lick the wax
[3:17:57] <dundore77> waxface doesn't effect the body
[3:17:58] <DatAsuna> @SouLucha again, bad doesn't mean hard, dragon god is easy as hell. It's also bad.
[3:18:04] <Visorak6> DOGFACE
[3:18:04] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:18:05] <+paladinstarbuster> dogface
[3:18:05] <%Frazzyfraznor> Kos second phase is bs
[3:18:05] <MyNameIsRasus> DOGFACE TOMI
[3:18:05] <%krispen_wa> Skull face?
[3:18:06] <BurdRightsActivist> @patriotrenegade Defiled Amygdala monkaS
[3:18:06] <+Stormzcales_Lair> cute face?
[3:18:06] <@akuda_bar> Nice Face
[3:18:08] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DOGFACE
[3:18:10] <%ChoculaUltra> even calling someone sexyface sounds oddly offensive
[3:18:10] <BlackermanZX> dogface
[3:18:11] <%Amaideus> What about "beautiful face"?
[3:18:11] <%dreadedcthulhu> beautiful face
[3:18:11] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[3:18:11] <%cvp5127> dogface LUL
[3:18:13] <lucky_icarus> DOGFACE
[3:18:14] <Belakitu> D: SKEET FACE?!
[3:18:20] <%ZweihanderSteve> REGGIE
[3:18:20] <DatAsuna> ghostface
[3:18:24] <+Grayhammatter> skeet face?! D:
[3:18:24] <@akuda_bar> D:
[3:18:24] <glass_marcus> blackface
[3:18:25] <SeniorTop> @MyNameIsRasus I have 0 problems with Congregation, it's basically Deacons from 3. It checks if you've actually learned to handle several mobs at once and is not a shitty gimmick fight like BoC.
[3:18:28] <nailwind> LUL all my deaths were to Rom in BB first time playing
[3:18:28] <linSP> Hey normal face
[3:18:33] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @knight_of_the_edge
[3:18:33] <+Derbisol> dont kink shame Reggie
[3:18:37] <nailwind> so much hatred for that boss
[3:18:37] <%ChoculaUltra> cutiehead
[3:18:38] <+Derbisol> skeet feet
[3:18:41] <+paladinstarbuster> it was a name of intent
[3:18:46] <roarofdamnation> Actually if he gets 18 on everything he can get the luck based boss sword, the OP Blueblood Sword.
[3:18:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19
[3:18:49] <%SouLucha> @DatAsuna Yeah, I don't disagree with that, but when people try to bad talk BB it seems more like salt.
[3:18:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> Aren't we all technically crafted from skeet?
[3:18:56] <RamenRiderZ> Coach Freke
[3:18:57] <SeniorTop> @MyNameIsRasus Royal Rat Authority is Sif with Adds almost literally.
[3:19:00] <%Amaideus> Congregation is literally that one room full of dudes before Bellfry Gargoyles, but with a HP bar attached
[3:19:16] <roarofdamnation> Correction scales with magic
[3:19:25] <+Grayhammatter> he's attuning right now
[3:19:30] <%ChoculaUltra> We are born of the skeet, made men by the skeet, undone by the skeet.
[3:19:31] <DatAsuna> @SouLucha except many of the worst bosses in BB are also the easiest, or the ones with the least difference from regular enemies.
[3:19:32] <%patriotrenegade> I love how apathetic Prince Lothric is in DS3. "Oh, dear brother.... I am on my way.... (I guess...)
[3:19:32] <linSP> fireball or firestorm
[3:19:33] <%Deekman> @roarofdamnation i think they patched that
[3:19:33] <Aydarkzero> don't wet yourself Kappa
[3:19:46] <+Mendin> I mean generally to receive the title "Sage" one has to have a long tenure
[3:19:47] <Kohei_kyouji> @WoolieVersus you can trade souls to yuria instead for different spells
[3:19:47] <+vaderxyz1970> Just Fireball
[3:19:49] <andre11dr> I think the Hamwik Witches and the Moon giant guy that i can't remember the name of are the worst bosses in BB
[3:19:56] <%ChoculaUltra> Kyo's shouting will never not be cool
[3:20:00] <%Amaideus> The One Reborn?
[3:20:07] <DatAsuna> Micolash and Hemwick are barely even bosses
[3:20:08] <%X2Eliah> moon presence?
[3:20:24] <andre11dr> No the one before Abriatas
[3:20:26] <MyNameIsRasus> @SeniorTop dude I'm not gonna respond to that 'cause the text would be too big, but i really could not disagree harder. I am glad you found those fights enjoyable though.
[3:20:31] <%patriotrenegade> Celestial Emissary
[3:20:34] <%Amaideus> ^
[3:20:39] <andre11dr> That one
[3:20:42] <OblivionSword1> Oh yeah we're missing one more spell teacher
[3:20:42] <%SouLucha> @DatAsuna I'd say some of the chalice ones were eh to boring due to just being a bunch of ganks or harder versions of normal enemies.
[3:20:45] <$arcielardor> GOD'S WRATH SPAM BABY
[3:20:45] <DatAsuna> celestial emissary is basically rats redux yeah
[3:20:51] <OblivionSword1> I forgot about her
[3:20:53] <ronin19xx> Firestorm is a nuke basically
[3:20:54] <%Amaideus> Know what's technically a boss in BB?
[3:20:59] <%Amaideus> The pig
[3:21:01] <%patriotrenegade> He's an actual threat in Chalice Dungeons, especially when you gotta fight two at once.
[3:21:01] <andre11dr> It's so good i couldn't even remember it's name LUL
[3:21:01] <DedlokPM> sbfpBaz CAN YOU FEEL THE FIRESTORM?
[3:21:03] <mark_collins45> Wrath of Khan?
[3:21:06] <Kohei_kyouji> chalice dungeon bosses dont count
[3:21:09] <ronin19xx> For big bosses
[3:21:11] <Kohei_kyouji> please dont let them count
[3:21:13] <%Amaideus> Why not
[3:21:15] <%Amaideus> They're bosses
[3:21:15] <SeniorTop> @MyNameIsRasus A lot of people have a hate boner for DS2 bosses, can't think of a single shitty gimmick one except maybe Duke's Dearest Freja. Honestly don't get most of the hate.
[3:21:16] <peachy996> I'm not saying all the BB bosses are good but as stupid as BoC or DG? I dunno
[3:21:17] <%dreadedcthulhu> 2ww: destroy all creatures. they can't be regenerated.
[3:21:18] <%Amaideus> They have names and HP bars
[3:21:20] <RamenRiderZ> God's Wrath aka HEEYEEY
[3:21:20] <%Amaideus> And fog walls
[3:21:21] <DatAsuna> wrath of god I remember using a lot for lizard hunting on PS3
[3:21:21] <%dreadedcthulhu> sorcery wp33d
[3:21:23] <%krispen_wa> Queen Yharnam was a cool fight at least
[3:21:23] <Kohei_kyouji> theyre mooks turned into bosses
[3:21:26] <%dreadedcthulhu> speed*
[3:21:28] <nailwind> obligatory ass probing animation
[3:21:28] <+paladinstarbuster> why not soul ray
[3:21:29] <%ChoculaUltra> the must count, so sayeth the boss health bar
[3:21:33] <Visorak6> hits multiple targets
[3:21:34] <%Amaideus> May as well say Taurus Demon isn't a boss then
[3:21:36] <Tuna_Can_0> @Amaideus I mean those cthulu face guards were pretty tough too imo
[3:21:39] <%patriotrenegade> Fuck you, Watchdog, Pthumerian and Headless are bosses
[3:21:50] <andre11dr> Abhorrent Beast was a cool boss
[3:21:51] <Kohei_kyouji> taurus demon was a boss FIRST and then a mook
[3:21:54] <DatAsuna> tarus demon is a boss, but also a fairly lame one
[3:21:55] <roarofdamnation> Soul Ray + Fire Spray combo tho
[3:21:57] <mousesorcerer> hi
[3:21:59] <linSP> giant pig is a boss don’t forget
[3:22:05] <xeros720> poison cloud works, but it's slow as hell
[3:22:09] <Kohei_kyouji> giant pig was amook THEN a boss
[3:22:09] <DatAsuna> He's the kinda boss you would put in that just becomes a normal enemy later
[3:22:12] <Kohei_kyouji> theres a difference
[3:22:14] <xeros720> "stream poison"
[3:22:16] <%patriotrenegade> But yeah, most chalice bosses are jobber enemies
[3:22:16] <%Amaideus> Not really?
[3:22:19] <+paladinstarbuster> soul ray and flame toss
[3:22:26] <%patriotrenegade> except the giants, those guys are no joke
[3:22:26] <peachy996> All the really annoying ones are dwelling around in Chalice Dungeons along with annoying enemies
[3:22:27] <Kohei_kyouji> big difference
[3:22:28] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[3:22:29] <%ChoculaUltra> speaking of BB, the elder lord Lance McDonald released the 60 fps patch for Bloodborne but I'm way too smooth brained to even bother to try to get it to work
[3:22:34] <%Amaideus> Boss that's also a later game enemy vs enemy that's turned into a boss isn't really different
[3:22:42] <andre11dr> What's the worst boss in DS2 ,JK they all suck
[3:22:43] <%A_German_spy> @ChoculaUltra You need a jailbroken console for it
[3:22:43] <peachy996> Like the Fireball Watch and the guy who runs at sanic speed
[3:22:44] <%Amaideus> "Later game"
[3:22:47] <Kohei_kyouji> i disagree
[3:22:54] <%Amaideus> Shit, you can fight the other tauruses right after queelag
[3:22:57] <%ChoculaUltra> @A_German_spy hopes and dreams slaughtered
[3:23:03] <%Amaideus> Oh wait no, right after ceaseless
[3:23:06] <knight_of_the_edge> @WoolieVersus firestorm LITERALLY broke the old demons souls to the point that you lost major frames whenever you cast it!!!
[3:23:07] <+Grayhammatter> pew pew, shotgun
[3:23:24] <DatAsuna> Honestly I would say Bloodborne probably has the worst overall rate of bosses. It has some great ones but I think it has the most bad bosses for a single game.
[3:23:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Poison kitchen knife?
[3:23:37] <%Amaideus> With chalices included?
[3:23:39] <%Amaideus> Definitely
[3:23:40] <%krispen_wa> But it also has the best DLC bosses not named Laurence
[3:23:44] <%Amaideus> Without them it's harder
[3:23:45] <%A_German_spy> @ChoculaUltra Yeah, sorry to be the bearer of bad news. If you can find a console with early enough firmware, you CAN JB it. It's a bit complicated, but doable.
[3:23:45] <DatAsuna> Also, Nioh is gucci for bosses and boss rematches
[3:23:46] <Kohei_kyouji> @DatAsuna 2nd worst maybe. Dark souls 2 is worse
[3:23:57] <nailwind> @DatAsuna it makes up for it by having nothing but good bosses lategame
[3:23:59] <%Amaideus> I'd say DeS has worse bosses overall in retrospect
[3:24:01] <MethodiaLordae> !uptime
[3:24:01] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 24 minutes
[3:24:12] <%krispen_wa> Nioh has some of the absolute worst human bosses though
[3:24:14] <%baka_sugoi> are we still fighting dargon god?
[3:24:15] <peachy996> @DatAsuna But even then the quality is not as dreadful as the worst or easiest Souls bosses
[3:24:16] <%Amaideus> But it's also the first, so that's not really a fair comparison
[3:24:16] <DatAsuna> @Kohei_kyouji Nah cause DS2 has bosses that mostly function as intended
[3:24:16] <Kohei_kyouji> Demons souls only has like 3 good bosses i think?
[3:24:18] <%Grimlockfly> Firestorm is ridic powerful in this one
[3:24:22] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:24:22] <%krispen_wa> Nioh generally has great big bosses though
[3:24:29] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Soul Ray will go through multiple enemies. It can wipe out entire groups if you line them up.
[3:24:30] <andre11dr> What's even the worst boss in Sekiro? I guess the moneys and they aren't even that bad
[3:24:31] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa I'm specifically talking about the humanoid bosses as the best ones. lol
[3:24:31] <shinichizio> Turns around, the entire Nexus is shot up
[3:24:34] <Visorak6> That fire spell completely bodies leechmonger
[3:24:38] <MyNameIsRasus> @SeniorTop honestly, i'd suggest Matthewmatosis' video on DS2 if you want some good criticism.
[3:24:42] <%Amaideus> I hated the demon of hatred
[3:24:45] <Kohei_kyouji> @DatAsuna as does bloodborne? but bloodbornes highs are higher than ds2s, debatable whether its lows are lower though
[3:24:47] <andre11dr> monkeys*
[3:24:48] <%krispen_wa> @datasuna kukai and onmyo guy from Nioh 2 disagree
[3:24:51] <peachy996> Nothing is as crap as the DS2 mob boss. A bunch of dudes in curch
[3:24:53] <DatAsuna> Like how all the human bosses you fight solo are actually designed with the tag-teams in mind
[3:25:01] <%baka_sugoi> @andre11dr headless monkey 1.0
[3:25:04] <%Amaideus> In BB?
[3:25:05] <SeniorTop> @MyNameIsRasus I've seen it, i wouldnt call it a good criticism. It's more highlighting his preferences, some of the points he makes aren't really objective.
[3:25:14] <DatAsuna> Nogunaga and Yuki-Onna are designed for their team-up despite being fought solo first .etc
[3:25:20] <%Amaideus> Hemwick witches aren't really any better
[3:25:30] <nailwind> Kappa
[3:25:34] <%krispen_wa> Imagine thinking the duo bosses were actually well designed
[3:25:39] <banirakohi> finished 13 sentinels and holy fuck
[3:25:40] <Necnill> Kappa
[3:25:42] <slix3431> Reggie and his sick bug build
[3:25:43] <%X2Eliah> 117
[3:25:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ONE DAY YOU WILL,FORGET
[3:25:45] <%krispen_wa> thank god nioh 2 took those out
[3:25:46] <%X2Eliah> that's nothing
[3:25:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:25:47] <%Amaideus> At least with the congregation I can end it in like, 20 seconds
[3:25:56] <peachy996> Hemwick Witches are still a means to an end. Just to equip runes.
[3:25:57] <%ChoculaUltra> @A_German_spy ooof that is a ton of work for 60 fps gameplay. I'll go back to hopelessly waiting for a PC port LUL
[3:26:02] <Kohei_kyouji> @MyNameIsRasus id say watch maulers videos on DS2 instead but...itd take a while
[3:26:10] <user_naim> What did I miss?
[3:26:11] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa They're literally designed to serve complimentary functions together, so yeah. lol
[3:26:11] <%Amaideus> Don't watch Mauler's
[3:26:19] <peachy996> Hemwick Witchs have a silly little gimmick compared to the DS2 Church goers
[3:26:20] <%Amaideus> That shit's too long and he doesn't understand a lot of the mechanics
[3:26:29] <%patriotrenegade> Go Shrine of Storms!
[3:26:33] <MyNameIsRasus> @SeniorTop again, could not disagree harder. but i'm not gonna keep on this 'cause woolie's chat is not the place. i'm glad you found enjoyment where i and many others could not.
[3:26:36] <andre11dr> But now the real question which are the best bosses in each game
[3:26:44] <DatAsuna> Like Tachibana and tadaktasu
[3:26:47] <%patriotrenegade> Lady MAria
[3:26:47] <%Amaideus> Well that's easy
[3:26:54] <%Amaideus> DeS is King Allant
[3:26:56] <%Amaideus> Storm King
[3:27:06] <%krispen_wa> all nioh dual bosses are cancer
[3:27:07] <andre11dr> @amaideus YES
[3:27:15] <%Amaideus> Saint (but not for gameplay reasons)
[3:27:18] <SeniorTop> @MyNameIsRasus You say that like im the only one who enjoyed it lol. DS2 is definitely not the best overall, but it definitely outshines both 3 and 1 in several aspects.
[3:27:27] <%A_German_spy> @ChoculaUltra Totally understandable
[3:27:32] <%Amaideus> And maybe 3-3's boss if you like PVP
[3:27:41] <%p4ntless> Ludwig the god damn holy blade
[3:27:49] <%krispen_wa> wait Kingdom hearts is coming to PC?
[3:27:52] <MyNameIsRasus> In BB it's either Maria or Gherman
[3:27:57] <mark_collins45> No hand rail, this place would not pass inspection.
[3:27:59] <MyNameIsRasus> those 2 are rad
[3:28:00] <Kohei_kyouji> or ludwig
[3:28:03] <DatAsuna> I don't consider a boss bad if it frustrates you
[3:28:05] <%Amaideus> DS1 is all the DLC bosses plus Gwyn (no parries), O&S, and maybe like, Sif
[3:28:06] <andre11dr> I think even if you don't like pvp Old Monk is still a wild idea
[3:28:07] <%SouLucha> I liked Midir and Nameless from DS3 bets.
[3:28:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Ludwig is also good
[3:28:11] <DatAsuna> I consider it bad if it fails to execute it's goal
[3:28:12] <user_naim> Pursuer in DS2 rocks
[3:28:21] <peachy996> Ludwig, Laurence, Maria
[3:28:23] <+Grayhammatter> imma say no
[3:28:27] <DatAsuna> Or if it's goal is just to throw a boss together out of existing assets
[3:28:29] <Visorak6> It will just waste 10 seconds of time
[3:28:30] <linSP> gotta drop down from the blocks reggie
[3:28:30] <Kohei_kyouji> pursuer aint that fun the 3rd of 4th time he shows up though
[3:28:30] <%krispen_wa> yeah i consider a boss bad when its bad, which is all the nioh 1 dual bosses
[3:28:34] <%Amaideus> DS2 is all the DLC bosses that aren't in the co-op areas
[3:28:38] <peachy996> Unpopular opinion but I love Orphan now
[3:28:41] <DedlokPM> psaPorgmo
[3:28:41] <%Amaideus> Also Dark Lurker
[3:28:42] <Tuna_Can_0> Pontiff and gael were fun :)
[3:28:53] <slix3431> Bug Souls
[3:28:59] <Kohei_kyouji> people hate orphans? @peachy996
[3:29:00] <%SouLucha> Orphan is dope, damn that thing though.
[3:29:01] <DatAsuna> Couldn't disagree more, the dual bosses are the most in that game to me. lol
[3:29:02] <%Amaideus> Velstadt's pretty alright too, and I like persuer
[3:29:06] <peachy996> Phase 2 is such a mad scramble
[3:29:07] <%krispen_wa> Nioh 2 makes me think far less fondly of nioh 1
[3:29:09] <Kohei_kyouji> *orphan of kos
[3:29:11] <%X2Eliah> yeeeah upper latria
[3:29:11] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @biomegabear
[3:29:11] <BurdRightsActivist> MITCH KING
[3:29:11] <andre11dr> I think Manus is the best DS1 boss
[3:29:13] <nailwind> Kreygasm Kos
[3:29:14] <user_naim> I love fighting Pursuer on the pizza slice of tile in the lost bastille.
[3:29:20] <DatAsuna> I'm gonna have to hear something more specific than "bad" to have my mind changed
[3:29:24] <%SouLucha> Manus and Kalameet from DS1.
[3:29:25] <Kohei_kyouji> @andre11dr i agree i think
[3:29:26] <peachy996> @Kohei_kyouji Well nobody likes it the first time lol
[3:29:33] <%krispen_wa> You aint changing my mind either
[3:29:36] <%Amaideus> I liked Orphan ffirst time
[3:29:38] <%krispen_wa> and my mind is right
[3:29:39] <+NeonLight> gat dang swamp
[3:29:42] <+Grayhammatter> the FILTH
[3:29:43] <%Frazzyfraznor> I loved orphan as soon as i beat it
[3:29:43] <%Amaideus> But I'm a masochist when it comes to gaming
[3:29:43] <%krispen_wa> i think
[3:29:44] <%p4ntless> POOP ZONE
[3:29:49] <therealtacopancakes> latria or skelly boys hype
[3:29:49] <%Amaideus> The harder I get beat the more I enjoy it
[3:29:52] <linSP> lake of poop
[3:29:57] <DatAsuna> Do you dislike the split of one putting on pressure and one hanging back, do you hate bosses using projectiles, what is it?
[3:29:57] <%X2Eliah> Man imagine your last set of maps being literal sludge swamps
[3:29:57] <Kohei_kyouji> @peachy996 i did lol. i wish he had a third form that triggered as he died so itd feel like you just stopped this monster from becoming truly unspoppable
[3:29:59] <brunoberserk> farrel3Pooph0les
[3:30:01] <Kohei_kyouji> *unstoppable
[3:30:04] <a_mad_dragon_> the filth was a weird fucking series
[3:30:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Orphan has such rad lore that I can forgive it being kind of a clusterfuck
[3:30:18] <%Amaideus> I know it's not actually canon
[3:30:23] <DatAsuna> Orphan is fine, it does what it sets out to.
[3:30:24] <peachy996> Really? Neat. I was expecting "you're crazy" responss
[3:30:26] <%krispen_wa> i havent played nioh 1 in years, but all i remember is that the dual bosses sucked
[3:30:30] <+G_Thunders> Gael was fun but mostly cause he was basically a bloodborne boss, complete with blue lightning and red skull magic
[3:30:30] <%Amaideus> But I like to think The One Reborn is Orphan of Kos reborn
[3:30:31] <%SouLucha> I'm not quite the masochist, but I know a cool boss when I see it, regardless of how hard it pushes my shit in.
[3:30:31] <andre11dr> And DS2 Raime and Sin were cool, Valstat ,Mirror Knight
[3:30:34] <%krispen_wa> and my impressions arent wrong
[3:30:35] <+NeonLight> It was too large to be a sword
[3:30:49] <%Frazzyfraznor> Sekiro bosses were the most difficult imo
[3:30:51] <%Amaideus> I always forget about looking glass knight
[3:30:56] <DatAsuna> I can't really engage with you much if there's so specifics, so sorry you had a bad time with them.
[3:31:08] <SeniorTop> DS2 best bosses: Pursuer, Sinner, Velstadt, Darklurker, Alonne, Fume, Sinh, Ivory King.

[3:31:16] <%krispen_wa> im just thankful nioh 2 is so much better
[3:31:24] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I'd put away the Meat Cleaver. It's super heavy, and it's also a Faith weapon.
[3:31:24] <DatAsuna> But personally I really like seeing duo-bosses that actually co-operate and serve different functions
[3:31:39] <SeniorTop> But BB has the best bosses overall, closely after DS3.
[3:31:39] <%Amaideus> Honestly Elana isn't that bad in retrospect
[3:31:40] <DatAsuna> Rather than just two enemies dropped in a room.
[3:31:40] <Tuna_Can_0> @G_Thunders lets just call DS3 a handicapped bloodborne Kappa
[3:31:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> How the shit do you build around something that aggro?
[3:31:44] <Kohei_kyouji> i feel like the dual bosses in nioh 1 are only realy 'fun' if youre overlevelled/overgeared. same with the dlc
[3:31:44] <%Amaideus> Even with Velstadt
[3:31:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Alonne and Veldsdadt are the DS2 highlights for me
[3:31:48] <%krispen_wa> alls i remember is that they certainlty did not feel like Ornstein and Smough
[3:31:50] <socialistbroccoli> hi dudes DxCat
[3:32:04] <%krispen_wa> Since EVERYONE in nioh 1 was fast
[3:32:04] <+Undenizen> I'm late! How's it going?
[3:32:06] <+Amaideus> Also your list is missing Dark Lurker @SeniorTop
[3:32:09] <DatAsuna> The DLC level gaps are very bad in a post-release context yeah
[3:32:11] <+G_Thunders> @tuna_can_0 been saying that since my first playthrough haha
[3:32:15] <user_naim> Oh Fume Knight of course!
[3:32:18] <%cache_22> I was out for an hour. Did Reggie conquer the Dragon God?
[3:32:24] <peachy996> He did
[3:32:26] <MyNameIsRasus> he did
[3:32:27] <zashrin777> dammit i missed dragon god
[3:32:28] <SeniorTop> @Amaideus Oh shit, yeah i was thinking of him, but forgot to actually write him down.
[3:32:29] <DatAsuna> They designed the power gap too much with release in mind and not people coming in late
[3:32:32] <peachy996> He almost died but he did it
[3:32:37] <Kohei_kyouji> @arcielardor sadly you have to go through tonnes of effort to reach that guy
[3:32:46] <%SouLucha> WHERE'S MY DRAGONATOR?!
[3:32:48] <%Amaideus> My favorite boss in DS3 is Pontif
[3:32:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:32:56] <DatAsuna> I don't think ornstein and smough is that much of a gold standard for tag teams
[3:32:59] <%Amaideus> The clone showing which attack he's gonna do next is NICE
[3:33:00] <andiwaffles> I sure hope that Freke is okay!
[3:33:07] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:33:08] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[3:33:08] <DatAsuna> It's fairly basic "big guy and quick guy"
[3:33:19] <%krispen_wa> and thats the perfect duo boss
[3:33:29] <Tuna_Can_0> @Amaideus its his stand and his stand is HIMSELF
[3:33:32] <DatAsuna> "perfect" is lofty
[3:33:34] <%Amaideus> Honestly 0&S kinda suck if you're trying to do Ornstein second
[3:33:39] <@Solidus_113> down to plow
[3:33:43] <andre11dr> DS3 I'll go Gwndyr ,The Prince's, Unded Legion, Nameless King ,Soul of Cinder, Demon Prince,Gael,Midir
[3:33:47] <user_naim> Fume Knight was the only boss where I learned how to deal with every move perfectly. Ran that so many times as a summin
[3:33:47] <DedlokPM> Or died to his Morning Breath (like Pat did psaWhat )
[3:33:51] <%Amaideus> The best dual boss in Souls is 1000% Friede though
[3:34:02] <Kohei_kyouji> @DatAsuna i basically beat the mian story of nioh, did 3 or 4 other characters up to the same point cos i like different builds, then ddint go back til the dlc released. 1 of my characters destroyed it cos they did a tiny bit of ng+. the other characters could barely scrape by. it wesnt good
[3:34:04] <%krispen_wa> man the way he swings that thing is so janky
[3:34:09] <andiwaffles> Reggie can't read chat so we can spoil yeah?
[3:34:09] <DatAsuna> DS1 is a good game, O&S is a good fight. Calling it perfect though? nah
[3:34:18] <OldManDeckardCain> dex later
[3:34:20] <%HeroToxiko> real thicc boi shit
[3:34:30] <+G_Thunders> Pontiff was originally supposed to be the final boss, back when DS3’s story was about defeating dark lords before they gutted all that.
[3:34:32] <Kohei_kyouji> @Amaideus i always do ornstein second? i find that easier
[3:34:41] <%krispen_wa> that weapon is like an offbrand scythe
[3:34:47] <LunarRemix> Reminds me of the Lucerne from DS1
[3:34:57] <BurdRightsActivist> @LunarRemix because it literally is
[3:34:59] <SeniorTop> O&S was the perfect mid game gatekeeper boss, just difficult enough to push you to your limit but not be impossible. That's why it's so memorable.
[3:35:01] <andiwaffles> I think Ornstein is easier to go first if you have a fast kinda build
[3:35:02] <%Amaideus> Fighting Smough with Ornstien flash stepping around the room is hell
[3:35:07] <Kohei_kyouji> @BurdRightsActivist yup yup
[3:35:08] <Tuna_Can_0> Personally I love the Champ, lore and fight. I just wish the fight was harder FeelsBadMan
[3:35:08] <DatAsuna> @Kohei_kyouji why did you make so many files though when respeccing is so easy?
[3:35:21] <KaiserMario> With the DBS
[3:35:34] <+Grayhammatter> the DBS
[3:35:42] <%krispen_wa> The Dragon Ball Super?
[3:35:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I think you're thinking of One-Hander R2 into One-Handed R1 on the DBS
[3:35:50] <DatAsuna> But yeah Like I said the level gaps between drops were not well considered for post-release players
[3:36:00] <andre11dr> O&S Also inspired the multi faze bossfights of the later games
[3:36:03] <KaiserMario> REGGIE
[3:36:08] <KaiserMario> No stamina man...
[3:36:12] <Kohei_kyouji> @DatAsuna i just prefer having each build go through the whole game from scratch so i can compare their strengths and weaknesses fairly. its no good using a ninja build for 100 levels and struggling, and then switch the samurai and dominate. makes for unfair comparisons
[3:36:24] <%krispen_wa> ugh and now i remember how wind was such a terrible element in Nioh. thank god they took it out in the sequel
[3:36:31] <KaiserMario> R2-R2 double handed DBS
[3:36:40] <DatAsuna> I guess, different builds have different contexts though yeah
[3:36:42] <%Amaideus> Champion Gundyr was so fucking hard with a greatsword
[3:36:47] <KaiserMario> Reggie didn't have stamina
[3:36:48] <%krispen_wa> that fucking masamune fight was cancer
[3:36:48] <%A_German_spy> spyYum
[3:36:55] <+Undenizen> did they add a way to respec in the remake?
[3:36:56] <DatAsuna> Ninja in the early game is a waste, onmyo late game falls off by comparison .etc
[3:37:00] <%Frazzyfraznor> I love the giant swords for some reason
[3:37:10] <+Rafraud> Its doable
[3:37:10] <Kohei_kyouji> @DatAsuna it was just an example
[3:37:15] <MyNameIsRasus> God I wish they didn't backdown on powerstancing
[3:37:26] <Kiras86> good luck to Reggie for the Maneater
[3:37:26] <DatAsuna> yeah and I commented on why it's a good example
[3:37:31] <BurdRightsActivist> Swampswamp
[3:37:32] <%cache_22> Ritual Path will be fun.
[3:37:33] <andiwaffles> So y'all should know that I'm average at best when it comes to souls games- died to Four Kings like 30 times, died to Logarious more than that, but I one shot O&S and it's my life's peak
[3:37:35] <andre11dr> Also underrated boss, Parrl ,awesome design
[3:37:36] <BurdRightsActivist> Swamp time :)
[3:37:39] <%p4ntless> PARTY TIME BAYBEE
[3:37:39] <Kohei_kyouji> @DatAsuna okk, sorry i misunderstood
[3:37:41] <+Rafraud> Lets goooooooo best choice
[3:37:48] <DatAsuna> Don't take every response to you that isn't "yeah" as an arguement. lol
[3:37:53] <andre11dr> OHHH LET'S GO
[3:37:57] <+Grayhammatter> Shadowmen
[3:37:57] <MyNameIsRasus> oh this is what we do
[3:37:58] <%krispen_wa> 4-2 was always the hardest area for me
[3:38:00] <BurdRightsActivist> CmonBruh
[3:38:04] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Woolie, Reggie didn't do the two handed R2-R2 because he was out of stamina, there's the stab on the ground move
[3:38:07] <BurdRightsActivist> cmonBruh
[3:38:08] <GeoffGeofreed> Time for Reggie to meet an Old Hero
[3:38:09] <%krispen_wa> mostly because its so narrow
[3:38:19] <DatAsuna> 4-2 was probably hardest for me first time too
[3:38:23] <+Rafraud> I'm assuming no spoilerinos right
[3:38:28] <andre11dr> This and 3-2 ,always were my faves
[3:38:30] <Kohei_kyouji> @krispen_wa its insanely tough in ng+
[3:38:32] <DatAsuna> I think it's also the stage I did the most pvp in lol
[3:38:40] <Tuna_Can_0> CiGrip ?
[3:38:40] <nailwind> @andiwaffles fucking proud my man
[3:38:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bone Smasher Reggarth
[3:38:54] <Kohei_kyouji> @andre11dr 3-2 is amazing. i will never change my mind on this

[3:39:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Smashing all the bones
[3:39:09] <andiwaffles> @nailwind thanks! I think it only happened because shit was too fast and chaotic for me to overthink myself into tilt hell
[3:39:12] <MyNameIsRasus> the back stabber. the hip breaker. the bone smasher.
[3:39:28] <RamenRiderZ> Skeletons don't like that blunt

[3:40:21] <chaos4ever181> We are PROUD man!
[3:40:27] <RickyRelucent> Don't givve up, reggaeton
[3:40:29] <andiwaffles> its super refreshing to watch someone play this blind, like, chat telling people what the boss gimmick are for the player to be like 'too easy' is really annoying
[3:40:35] <andiwaffles> im hype for Old Hero
[3:40:49] <nailwind> old hero will be fun to see reggie react to
[3:40:52] <OblivionSword1> it is a big sword
[3:41:02] <andre11dr> Does he still have thief ring one?
[3:41:07] <%krispen_wa> rolling in 4-2 though...
[3:41:07] <Necnill> ABR. Always be rolling.
[3:41:11] <Kohei_kyouji> @andiwaffles we're all too busy arguing to backseat at the moment lol
[3:41:13] <MyNameIsRasus> It's more useful than nothing
[3:41:15] <%Lion_kun> Reggie, you will one-shot the skeletons
[3:41:19] <andiwaffles> it's super satisfying when you figure out that he's blind without being told
[3:41:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> big slab
[3:41:25] <DatAsuna> Just be paige, block with your sword and roll with your shield
[3:41:29] <andiwaffles> @Kohei_kyouji Reggie isn't reading chat tho right?
[3:41:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> oof right in the butt
[3:41:35] <OblivionSword1> right in the butt
[3:41:37] <nailwind> can imagine cus him being blind was spoiled to me :(
[3:41:41] <Kohei_kyouji> nah, i was just joking anyway
[3:41:43] <dinnydanny777> Roll over the enemies with your sword
[3:41:43] <%Frazzyfraznor> This lvl wouldn't be so bad if it wasnt for those damn rays shooting at you
[3:41:47] <andiwaffles> oh thank god lmao
[3:41:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Fire soul ray at them, GET YOUR REVENGE, RAGGARTH

[3:42:37] <OblivionSword1> THE HYENA
[3:42:38] <BurdRightsActivist> ELLO SONYA
[3:42:44] <BurdRightsActivist> I STUDIED ALL YER MOVES SONYA
[3:42:44] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[3:42:46] <%patriotrenegade> He's alright
[3:42:46] <+QueequegTheater> WHAT? PATCHES IS A PARAGON OF KINGLY VIRTUE!
[3:42:55] <%kewlmyc> sure....
[3:42:57] <RamenRiderZ> Play, play, life's an adventure
[3:42:58] <user_naim> All your moves!
[3:43:01] <linSP> Whaaat patches is the COOLEST GUY
[3:43:01] <+Undenizen> Patches? Unbreakable patches?? NEVER! BEST GUY I KNOW.
[3:43:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Patches the Soulsgames Cid
[3:43:08] <andiwaffles> @krispen_wa you must be some kind of cleric :p
[3:43:15] <+Mendin> Patches? Yeah he's my grass dealer
[3:43:16] <%Frazzyfraznor> Thief ring is great for the rays tho
[3:43:16] <+QueequegTheater> I'VE STUDIED ALL YOUR MOVES
[3:43:18] <%cache_22> "It's just a prank, bro." - Patches, probably
[3:43:26] <+eanscrale> Yo you gonna let him talk about your boy Patches like that???
[3:43:28] <%krispen_wa> so does patches actually have a killcount?
[3:43:29] <%Grimlockfly> number one arrow guy!
[3:43:29] <%patriotrenegade> But sir, the police have photos of Patches the Hyena nailing your head to the floor
[3:43:30] <BurdRightsActivist> I CURL UP INTO A BALL
[3:43:34] <+QueequegTheater> @cache_22 Not even probably, he literally says that in DS1
[3:43:38] <DatAsuna> Umbasa
[3:43:43] <+Rafraud> Best shop
[3:43:46] <Victory_Boss> The plug
[3:43:52] <RamenRiderZ> Patches the atheist prankster
[3:44:00] <andre11dr> Patches might be an actual God,
[3:44:07] <MyNameIsRasus> "look dad it's the good grass" "this is the graverobber bilge store, how good can it be"
[3:44:19] <%patriotrenegade> Just a falchion
[3:44:29] <andiwaffles> I killed Patches in DeS because Ostrava died and I didn't know that he can die by looping around in the world, and Patches said he hates the monarchy so I freaked out :(
[3:44:31] <linSP> I never found a use for cloud stone when there’s the dark silver shield that blocks ALL magic damage
[3:44:44] <%RyTYoung> but you MIGHT
[3:44:46] <CappuccinoGuil> Most importantly, he sells poison throwing daggers
[3:44:50] <%krispen_wa> He sells arroz?
[3:44:51] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So those Soul Remains? I strongly recommend that Reggie equip those on the quick menu and throw one at some enemies to see how they work. They're buckets of fun.
[3:45:02] <andre11dr> I mean my man Patches survived to see the end of the world in DS3 that's kinda nuts
[3:45:02] <Kohei_kyouji> ^
[3:45:15] <CappuccinoGuil> Kunais are incredibly good
[3:45:23] <%Frazzyfraznor> Which goes perfect with the reaper farm
[3:45:23] <SeniorTop> Patches has literally survived several hundred kingdoms falling and being reborn. He is more of a god than Gwyn lol.
[3:45:31] <+QueequegTheater> That was Unbreakable Patches, not Patches the Hyena, who was also not Trusty Patches
[3:45:33] <dinnydanny777> Maybe Patches is fueled by backstabbing
[3:45:34] <%Grimlockfly> Patches is the Goat
[3:45:37] <%krispen_wa> hes not a god. hes just Unbreakable
[3:45:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Correction: Kunais are good IF you know when to use them
[3:45:47] <Kohei_kyouji> @A_German_spy hows it going franz?
[3:45:47] <andiwaffles> @andre11dr DS1 Patches survived for me I highly enjoyed him shit-talking the other NPCs
[3:45:51] <SeniorTop> @krispen_wa What's the difference?
[3:45:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> treasure is temporary, Patches is eternal
[3:45:58] <%A_German_spy> @Kohei_kyouji charly23Hi
[3:46:01] <%krispen_wa> @seniortop gods can die
[3:46:05] <DatAsuna> who's more trustworthy, patches or RICHARD?
[3:46:09] <%p4ntless> maybe there's a family of patches like the nurse joys and officer jennies
[3:46:31] <andre11dr> Also he was a spider that one time
[3:46:35] <nailwind> POV: you are in a hentai
[3:46:41] <%krispen_wa> Maybe patches is like Darkseid. every Patch is just an avatar of True Patches
[3:46:42] <dinnydanny777> Patches is the Demon soul
[3:46:50] <+QueequegTheater> @A_German_spy Consider this: If Solaire is so much cooler than Lucatiel why doesn't he have a cool hat KappaHD
[3:46:53] <user_naim> So did a bald guy mug Miyazaki in his childhood or something?
[3:46:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1359058937946009600?s=19

[3:47:16] <%RyTYoung> I forgot about this cutscene!
[3:47:17] <%krispen_wa> SPOOKY
[3:47:17] <%cache_22> Reggie was preparing for some Indiana Jones type nonsense.
[3:47:17] <resloxxx> peko peko peko
[3:47:17] <%p4ntless> pain peko
[3:47:18] <nailwind> pain peko

[3:47:22] <+Rafraud> is he tho?
[3:47:24] <+QueequegTheater> @A_German_spy Everyone needs a cool hat
[3:47:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> necromancy?
[3:47:27] <SeniorTop> Bald guy mugged Miyazaki when he was child, but later hung out around his house selling grass and poison arrows.
[3:47:27] <BurdRightsActivist> SATAN
[3:47:29] <%patriotrenegade> HE'S A NERD
[3:47:30] <andiwaffles> @andre11dr I played Bloodborne before any other souls games and went straight to OG Demon's, and when I heard of Patches 'the hyena' I thought he was literally going to be a hyena... but he was just a dude :p
[3:47:31] <dinnydanny777> Nothing more cool than an add boss
[3:47:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh look, free 4500 souls Kappa
[3:47:33] <+Mendin> That's real fucken neato
[3:47:42] <+NeonLight> Enter the heat of battle

[4:08:36] <andiwaffles> we alllll drown in pools sometimes
[4:08:47] <%p4ntless> I love rolling down from there and hitting the boney boy with a dynamic entry
[4:08:52] <CappuccinoGuil> It has a specific use. Use it specifically

[4:10:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> you know what else can sweep multiple enemies in a single swing?
[4:10:56] <linSP> sharp warsycthe works great with dex
[4:10:56] <andre11dr> It sucks they don't drop their actual scythe, especially since now it's an actual weapon
[4:10:58] <+paladinstarbuster> shhot him

[4:14:20] <user_naim> Swing first
[4:14:23] <andiwaffles> @MyNameIsRasus ugh I hate them both, pretty sure Urbain shittalks The Maiden Astraea which is UNFORGIVABLE
[4:14:28] <CappuccinoGuil> swing first, ALWAYS
[4:14:39] <+paladinstarbuster> not fast enough to counterhit
[4:14:42] <%Javaa01> You need to book your swing a week in advance
[4:14:44] <DatAsuna> You have the longer reach
[4:14:44] <%Frazzyfraznor> Reggie needs to lghten his load so he can roll
[4:14:46] <CappuccinoGuil> You are NOT looking for an opening, you BREAK it through
[4:14:48] <%SouLucha> Get into Souls PvP
[4:14:52] <DatAsuna> punish their approach
[4:14:52] <%patriotrenegade> swing first, nephew
[4:15:02] <%patriotrenegade> i love that video

[4:15:17] <%krispen_wa> Im a veteran and I STILL accidentally kick
[4:15:27] <%krispen_wa> its not something you can control
[4:15:30] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus The R2-R2 two-handed pancakes a human enemy in front of you and you can follow-up with an otg stab
[4:15:31] <%Javaa01> Also panic rolling with fat roll is risky
[4:15:34] <%Javaa01> It can get you killed
[4:15:42] <%Javaa01> It's not as free as quick rolling
[4:15:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Anticipatory is a good vocab word
[4:15:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolieONEGUY
[4:16:03] <andiwaffles> Patches is a baller
[4:16:04] <user_naim> Pointing to the stands in every fight
[4:16:07] <DatAsuna> you can make the accidents happen a lot less though
[4:16:08] <Darren716> Eh they were all clerics, probably
[4:16:09] <%patriotrenegade> naw, he's cool
[4:16:14] <MyNameIsRasus> THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR KICKING
[4:16:21] <NeonBleu> gotta refill that shop somehow Kappa
[4:16:21] <%patriotrenegade> Clerics aren't people
[4:16:22] <andiwaffles> @Darren716 clerics, royalty, who needs 'em
[4:16:24] <rcand9> sprinting r1 is the best
[4:16:33] <%FrostedZaibatsu> And these MFer say Patches is good. Kill him
[4:16:33] <%p4ntless> good thing clerics aren't people :kappa:
[4:16:43] <andre11dr> Clerics are dumb ,they deserve to die
[4:17:02] <%notsoy> isn't there an item on top of that pile?
[4:17:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, tell him about the bow and arrow snipe exploit in this area
[4:17:09] <BurdRightsActivist> we fly high
[4:17:12] <BurdRightsActivist> no lie you know it
[4:17:18] <%krispen_wa> TRAP ROOM
[4:17:23] <%Frazzyfraznor> Spend those
[4:17:39] <%superc37> wow woolie i cant believe youd spoiler reggie like that /s
[4:18:05] <MethodiaLordae> Patches has bones, you could smash them
[4:18:05] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Look at that shit eating grin
[4:18:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> Friendship with Patches ended. Now Skeetface is my best friend.
[4:18:23] <andre11dr> Well,you still need a weed dealer so better keep him around
[4:18:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie, you have magic, you can shoot those mantarays LUL
[4:18:45] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus GG!
[4:18:47] <DatAsuna> the rolls are fat, as is the ass
[4:19:11] <user_naim> Fat rolls of cheap money!
[4:19:20] <andiwaffles> 4-2 was the hardest area for me in the entire game I think
[4:19:27] <%Seancicle> dat azz
[4:19:46] <andre11dr> Just get Vit
[4:20:00] <%Deekman> that swamp is the worst
[4:20:02] <CappuccinoGuil> Back out, see how much Equip burden he has now, double that. That's how much he needs
[4:20:11] <%Deekman> 5-2
[4:20:27] <rcand9> even a fatrolls "ok" in pve with timing
[4:20:37] <andre11dr> Now thst you can see ,5-2 is not as bad
[4:20:47] <Visorak6> you can plunge attack him from the platform above Im p sure

[4:22:27] <CSword514> 4-3 is a better area for farming souls
[4:22:31] <%superc37> dude souls games are MADE for bitching out tf are yall talking about
[4:22:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @cherryceecee Sure feels good, though.
[4:22:39] <%Frazzyfraznor> Work smart not hard
[4:22:49] <%A_German_spy> @CSword514 Yeah, but until you unlock it, this is the best you get

[4:25:16] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus spyYum
[4:25:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> By up ahead does he mean 4-3 after the boss is dead? You just farm the storm beasts?
[4:25:25] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Call it a "Drop Your Shield" moment
[4:25:38] <user_naim> Have at thee Wizard! Taste my one-inch spell

[4:26:05] <ZComiX> REJECT MODERNITY
[4:26:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's what I thought. Right now 4-2 entrace is the best soul farming spot. After that it's 4-3. 4-2 is quicker
[4:26:11] <andiwaffles> its not a big deal but it really feels like, when people watch others play souls games blind, they imagine this heroic montage of perfection when it comes to their own playthrough and call people out but I'm sure that everyone died in super embarrassing ways, over and over

[4:39:16] <roarofdamnation> Or... get naked
[4:39:17] <+Mendin> He loves magic, but maybe he hates a different element that you have on a lighter sword??

[4:39:41] <%Amaideus> What's even here?
[4:39:42] <%Deekman> why're we trying to beat him?
[4:39:45] <%A_German_spy> @cache_22 It's considered a Large Axe
[4:39:46] <Kiras86> The real Demon Soul's starts now
[4:39:48] <%superc37> wait he doesnt have the stats for the cleaver tho
[4:39:48] <+Rafraud> the black is violence
[4:39:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Rolling good?
[4:39:55] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe take armor off?
[4:39:56] <user_naim> Wow that does nothing
[4:39:59] <roarofdamnation> Yeah the meat cleaver aint it, get naked Reggie, just the dragon bone.
[4:40:00] <ronin19xx> BKS BOYS!
[4:40:02] <+paladinstarbuster> the principle tho
[4:40:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Maybe use shield?
[4:40:04] <roarofdamnation> Get naked and bone him
[4:40:06] <ainda_> nudity! nudity! nudity!
[4:40:08] <%superc37> so hes doing fuck all for damage
[4:40:10] <Basic_Birch_> Reggie seems to be getting really frustrated
[4:40:18] <%superc37> or not lol
[4:40:32] <%Deekman> 2 hands
[4:40:33] <user_naim> Naked sword might be good,
[4:40:34] <Style_train_14> YES
[4:40:38] <%krispen_wa> BECOME NAKED

[4:40:44] <+jiggy_snipe> not completely naked maybe
[4:40:44] <nailwind> thats my night time challenge Kreygasm
[4:40:47] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus The game's pretty real from now on, so Reggie's gotta step-up or he'll suffer immensely soon
[4:40:47] <Style_train_14> NAKED BONE SMASHIN MAN
[4:40:48] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe just pants
[4:40:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggarth of the Naked Bone
[4:40:48] <+paladinstarbuster> take arms and pants off
[4:40:50] <blink289> did i miss the thing
[4:40:51] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Meat Cleaver is gonna produce poor damage because Reggie doesn't have enough Faith for it, and half its damage (the magic portion) scales with Faith
[4:40:59] <%yusefHD> YOOO
[4:41:00] <+QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[4:41:02] <nailwind> GET OUT
[4:41:02] <%KeiganOfAstora> Woolie stop poking him with the subtle "You should use the DBS"
[4:41:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YOOOOOOOOO

[4:41:21] <rcand9> thats the smasher
[4:41:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> REGGARTH REGGARTH REGGARTH
[4:41:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> it feels like reggie feels forced to do certain things as woolie tells him what's good
[4:41:26] <+ArmoredAnathema> Quit and reload to get his stuff
[4:41:26] <roarofdamnation> We take those
[4:41:32] <rcand9> thats why we smash reggie
[4:41:33] <+kevlarkoala> lucky lucky, because Reggie definitely wasn't getting the "you can roll with this weapon if you lose your armor" thought process lol
[4:41:34] <rosemon5001> doesnt it spawn it when you relog?
[4:41:36] <+Rafraud> Reload to get thing I think
[4:41:37] <user_naim> worked out i guess
[4:41:37] <%Deekman> thiefs ring is good here so they can't see you
[4:41:41] <user_naim> Brute smarts
[4:41:45] <%A_German_spy> @user_naim Yeah. Reggie can technically two-hand it because he has enough strength, but his faith shortage is gimping the magic portion of its damage
[4:41:58] <andiwaffles> I hope he doesn't use thief ring
[4:41:58] <%yusefHD> Dude's getting clapped offscreen lmaoo

[4:44:29] <Jaysky> Too heavy to be a weapon - it's a force of power.
[4:44:35] <andiwaffles> what about the uh, spider bow or whatever
[4:44:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> two strings
[4:44:37] <MethodiaLordae> "looks like shit"
[4:44:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's two bows taped together
[4:44:45] <Style_train_14> It looks hype
[4:44:46] <therealtacopancakes> looks dope, reggie filtered
[4:44:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> @user_naim Too late, he already put it into stats
[4:44:47] <+QueequegTheater> Wait that's not how bows work
[4:44:53] <+QueequegTheater> Why would it have two stings
[4:44:54] <%Deekman> the whole fist
[4:45:00] <+QueequegTheater> *strings
[4:45:05] <+Grayhammatter> the whole fist
[4:45:08] <user_naim> alas
[4:45:09] <VoraciousKain> double damage duh
[4:45:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @QueequegTheater more string more damage don't worry about it
[4:45:24] <Jaysky> @queequegtheater It works because shutupitworks
[4:45:25] <andiwaffles> huh? is he thinking about Pharis? I don't remember the owner of that bow
[4:45:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> Compound bows have more than one string right?
[4:45:38] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus The Bowoman was Phalanx
[4:45:47] <andiwaffles> ohhhh
[4:46:02] <pmda2126> that's how bow? cool

[4:47:44] <DatAsuna> das gud
[4:47:53] <KaiserMario> @andiwaffles The conversation with Ostrava gives you the name, and you meet the Red phantom on 1-4, also, when you kill Phalanx, the ghost of an archer appears over it
[4:47:53] <MethodiaLordae> I thought you meant DS1 gold boy haha
[4:47:56] <VoraciousKain> well we can talk about it because reggie doesn't read chat

[4:50:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:50:21] <+QueequegTheater> Yurt doesn't kill Thomas or the Maiden so Woolie should probably just let it rock
[4:50:37] <KaiserMario> @andiwaffles Woolie needs to at least point out the corpses, or Reggie will probably ruin his game... LUL
[4:50:39] <+cherryceecee> @Style_train_14 that gets fixed a bit with weapon arts in later games
[4:50:48] <andiwaffles> @QueequegTheater lore-wise it'd be a shame if he killed Freke tho because he drops some important info at the end

[4:52:30] <Josef_Stryker> Worth it
[4:52:31] <+kevlarkoala> i feel like there should be a slightly stronger push to drop some armor from Woolie? Because Reggie WANTS to roll, and this is killing him
[4:52:31] <%RyTYoung> OMG
[4:52:38] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:52:48] <%Deekman> did he get the blessed mace?
[4:52:52] <andiwaffles> @Mendin I'd be ok with Woolie pointing out a corpse if Reggie doesn't see it but having NPCs die is part of the souls experience tbh
[4:52:55] <%RyTYoung> you jammy bastard LUL
[4:52:59] <%notsoy> break out one of the maces, or just punch them
[4:53:05] <+kevlarkoala> like, it'd be straight up helping reggie to play the game the way he's displaying he wants to play it
[4:53:21] <user_naim> Echoes of Anor Londo
[4:53:22] <VoraciousKain> reggie wants the armor
[4:53:23] <DatAsuna> Lowkey, just try your bare fists, big blunt damage and you can quick roll then
[4:53:25] <%krispen_wa> having NPCs die is the opposite of the souls experience
[4:53:34] <Style_train_14> Reggie straight said he didnt want to take off his clothes tho
[4:53:39] <%krispen_wa> Its the one thing you want to avoid or it discourages you completely
[4:53:43] <pmda2126> if only the belmonts had it that easy
[4:53:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> WOOOOOOW
[4:53:49] <Style_train_14> LMAO
[4:53:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie said he could drop armor, he didn't internalize it so oh well

[4:54:01] <Josef_Stryker> RIP Souls
[4:54:01] <%Amaideus> Well, now they're even
[4:54:10] <+Rafraud> It begins
[4:54:12] <%ChoculaUltra> had to make sure he was dead before he hit the ground, respectable
[4:54:23] <%krispen_wa> lauthrec is intended. DeS NPC deaths are dumb
[4:54:31] <user_naim> Oh is this that wwg1wga that Woolie talked about? Must be
[4:54:37] <%krispen_wa> since you can lose ACTUAL important people
[4:54:37] <andiwaffles> @krispen_wa yeah of course but you have to experience the unforgiving nature of NPC interactions to know there's risk involved and to ultimately stress in attempt to avoid death
[4:54:39] <+QueequegTheater> I'M READY! HOW BOUT YOU?
[4:54:45] <%krispen_wa> no, thats dumb
[4:54:45] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Why does the reaper sound like a Velociraptor
[4:54:51] <Style_train_14> NICE
[4:54:51] <GeoffGeofreed> I wonder if woolie would just stay quite when Reggie meets "that" NPC
[4:54:52] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That's it right there!
[4:54:53] <%Wouldz> THERE IT IS
[4:54:54] <andiwaffles> it's a bleak world
[4:54:56] <+Rafraud> Prediction for if Reggie gets the Scythe drop or boss kill first
[4:54:58] <%krispen_wa> Lauthrec is reversible. DeS isnt
[4:55:01] <%Amaideus> My brother killed Andre to get the crest early instead of buying it
[4:55:07] <%Amaideus> He dearly regretted that mistake
[4:55:14] <+GilroyGoldBlood> we made progress
[4:55:15] <DedlokPM> mogsThisIsFine
[4:55:19] <+jiggy_snipe> @Rafraud I think it dropped already
[4:55:21] <OblivionSword1> Don't miss
[4:55:24] <+Rafraud> o pog
[4:55:29] <DatAsuna> being able to kill NPCs was a major part of what got people's attention to souls early on tho lol
[4:55:34] <VoraciousKain> yurt the silent chief is an npc you can choose to save out of a cell and in turn he kills other npcs at the nexus
[4:55:42] <+QueequegTheater> @Amaideus I hope he liked fire and magic weapons
[4:55:43] <%krispen_wa> spoilers
[4:55:43] <andiwaffles> yeah my friend killed Crestfallen immediately and I thought to myself, I guess nobody will tell you that there are actually TWO bells of awakening
[4:55:53] <+paladinstarbuster> if your not gonna roll you can switch your magic and buff up
[4:55:55] <%Wouldz> woolieONEGUY
[4:55:59] <+cherryceecee> ds2 does it way better with navlaan since your punishment is just a tough invader at a couple places instead of perma npc deaths
[4:56:01] <DatAsuna> these dang dark souls zoomers
[4:56:01] <VoraciousKain> doesn't matter, reggie doesn't have chat sight
[4:56:02] <%A_German_spy> @Amaideus These games give you enough rope to hang yourself spyYum
[4:56:07] <%krispen_wa> npcs dying is why i use a guide for all my playthroughs
[4:56:07] <andiwaffles> @VoraciousKain well what order does he kill in? I know it's Mephistophele's list
[4:56:07] <MethodiaLordae> @andiwaffles good thing you were there to tell them
[4:56:12] <Style_train_14> Yurt's helmet is so cool its like a teutonic knight or whatever
[4:56:18] <%krispen_wa> I refuse to miss content

[4:56:33] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[4:56:33] <+QueequegTheater> @andiwaffles IIRC it's the minor ones first then Freke and Urbain last?
[4:56:34] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I BELIEVE
[4:56:36] <VoraciousKain> idk
[4:56:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The rolls are killing him
[4:56:42] <MethodiaLordae> AWh
[4:56:43] <andiwaffles> if a minor one dies first its ok
[4:56:49] <user_naim> borf
[4:57:00] <andiwaffles> like it's depressing but that's the experience
[4:57:09] <andre11dr> I get a feeling that he won't finish this today
[4:57:11] <GeoffGeofreed> He NEEDS a Roll
[4:57:11] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Can you remind Reggie punching is still viable if he's frustrated?
[4:57:11] <Style_train_14> Do you take extra damage in roll recovery in this game?
[4:57:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> blasted
[4:57:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sheesh
[4:57:14] <%krispen_wa> its a dumb experience that actively makes you lose items and content
[4:57:18] <+Grayhammatter> oof, counterhit
[4:57:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:57:19] <+paladinstarbuster> not fast enough
[4:57:21] <+kumaprime> ooof
[4:57:21] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:57:27] <ainda_> i think Reggie thinks running around with a fat roll and a giant weapon is like, the normal or corrrect way to do it
[4:57:35] <ainda_> so he refused to take clothes off
[4:57:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Simply parry the skeletons
[4:57:38] <+jiggy_snipe> or take off armor
[4:57:41] <andiwaffles> the loss IS content, at least to me, I'm all about the feels
[4:57:46] <+jiggy_snipe> take those pants off
[4:57:53] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Meat Cleaver is Slash
[4:57:53] <+QueequegTheater> @andiwaffles Two unnamed bodies, Freke's apprentice, Acolyte of God, Patches, Urbain, Freke, Yuria
[4:58:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I think reggie should briefly go back to look through everything he has to see what other blunt weapons he has
[4:58:05] <%krispen_wa> i got through my first playthrough without loss
[4:58:08] <DatAsuna> I don't think big windups are his thing
[4:58:08] <andiwaffles> if it got to the point where a super super important NPC was going to get yeeted, maybe hint
[4:58:11] <%krispen_wa> your experience is irrelevant
[4:58:16] <+paladinstarbuster> he resited because he doesnt understand
[4:58:22] <andiwaffles> @QueequegTheater oh that's fair warning
[4:58:28] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa yours is equally irrelevant tho
[4:58:36] <+QueequegTheater> More fair than I thought TBH
[4:58:39] <VoraciousKain> gottem
[4:58:48] <+QueequegTheater> I remembered it being way worse for some reason
[4:58:49] <ainda_> i think he thinks his armor does more damage mitigation than it actually does
[4:58:50] <+Mendin> Reggie has a fire longsword, which lets him shield + fight sksletons as an alternative
[4:58:58] <andiwaffles> @krispen_wa lmao like yeah its subjective but that's my POV, all of our opinions 'don't matter' by that logic we can have input
[4:59:04] <+b_aleph> oh, I remember this, it's the blind boss area
[4:59:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Style_train_14
[4:59:18] <+b_aleph> Poor melee reggie
[4:59:29] <DatAsuna> Too many people read people saying contradicting opinions as trying to change their mind
[4:59:30] <+paladinstarbuster> yay
[4:59:32] <crazzmatazz2> buttcheeks FIRMLY clenched
[4:59:34] <%krispen_wa> this aint a bioware game where loss is a narrative inevitbility. its gameplay loss
[4:59:34] <VoraciousKain> old hero looks like a cool boss but he's a chump
[4:59:43] <DatAsuna> If someone says they don't agree with you, they're not telling you to change
[4:59:46] <%krispen_wa> and dark souls is a gameplay game first and foremost
[5:00:07] <DatAsuna> @krispen_wa >bioware >actually having loss
[5:00:08] <Style_train_14> See why doesnt the DBS get armor frames like the cleaver and other great hammers?
[5:00:09] <DatAsuna> kek
[5:00:11] <+QueequegTheater> PogChamp
[5:00:16] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus A useful property of weapons like the Meat Cleaver and the DBS is that their two-handed R2 attacks have hyper armor during the middle of their animations, so you can use that to trade with faster enemies as long as you don't get hit too early.
[5:00:26] <VoraciousKain> cause the DBS has no edge
[5:00:26] <+b_aleph> I don't agree with any of y'all in chat, so that means you're all wrong. I learned this directly from Pat too!
[5:00:29] <DatAsuna> just max your blue meter and save everyone with your big blue points
[5:00:38] <andiwaffles> @krispen_wa I think its fine for some people to appreciate elements like lore, story-telling and world building over mechanics but it's whatever, I get why you see it that way all g
[5:00:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> CLANG
[5:00:43] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You can't backstab on a roll attack
[5:00:43] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm not wrong, you're just not right!
[5:00:49] <MethodiaLordae> Mirror match
[5:00:50] <%krispen_wa> like if a game made me lose half of my available spells because an NPC killed people, thats stupid as shit and would make me quit the game immediately
[5:01:03] <DSD24> Gold Twohander Skeleton
[5:01:17] <%Amaideus> Honestly you should have damage resitance while you're armoring through stuff
[5:01:18] <+cherryceecee> @krispen_wa especially since int is the best des build
[5:01:19] <RamenRiderZ> POISE POISE POISE 🎵
[5:01:19] <agnetj> I thought I was already following you guys! It might have been just the podcast channel! LUL
[5:01:22] <+QueequegTheater> Demon's Souls, the true Tekken
[5:01:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Use more fighting game terms
[5:01:27] <user_naim> The shock of loss is a designed part of the game. Question is whether it’s good/acceptable. But it’s certainly content
[5:01:29] <VoraciousKain> Jesus man its a game, you lose some stuff you can see next playthrough
[5:01:31] <DatAsuna> Good for you, but some people like potentially missable content
[5:01:32] <+kevlarkoala> hearing that you could irrecoverably fuck up your worldstate is why I never wanted to play DeS
[5:01:33] <MethodiaLordae> @agnetj yeah they're seperate

[5:01:49] <+b_aleph> drill them from the back
[5:01:49] <+QueequegTheater> @kevlarkoala It's really hard to do that
[5:01:50] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa Im interested, how do you feel about Darkest Dungeon
[5:02:05] <%krispen_wa> never played that game, not really interested
[5:02:09] <+MisleadingEchoes> @VoraciousKain right? People are too "hurr durr need to see everything in the first playthrough" and end up backseating everything
[5:02:10] <pennykettle_> StinkyCheese
[5:02:12] <%Amaideus> scum it out!
[5:02:13] <glass_marcus> Galaxy Brained
[5:02:13] <%ChoculaUltra> loss makes the heart grow fonder tho
[5:02:19] <andre11dr> Because that's like the anti you game if you're that type of player
[5:02:20] <ainda_> fffwhack a mole
[5:02:20] <MethodiaLordae> Begg brain
[5:02:23] <DatAsuna> Yeah it's not only quite hard tog et into the worst case scenario but demon's is so much shorter and more run based than later souls games that it's a far smaller problem too
[5:02:25] <+jiggy_snipe> bonk him on the head
[5:02:27] <%krispen_wa> loss just makes me depressed and sad
[5:02:31] <VoraciousKain> ngl i wish pat hadn't told woolie to save solaire the first time
[5:02:38] <Josef_Stryker> BIG BRAIN

[5:02:44] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[5:02:44] <+cherryceecee> @andre11dr darkest is a rogue lite so you still keep all your town upgrades, kinda different from yurty yeeting the cast
[5:02:46] <Style_train_14> I missed Yurt entirely on my first playthrough. Only discovered him when people told me what happens. Now I just kill him for the cool helmet
[5:02:47] <DatAsuna> Lucky Reg
[5:02:47] <+Grayhammatter> the big brain
[5:02:49] <%Amaideus> Now THIS is Souls!
[5:02:51] <DSD24> Soul Calibur 6 intensifies
[5:02:54] <GeoffGeofreed> 200 IQ plays
[5:02:56] <%Amaideus> Scumming it out IS the game
[5:03:04] <%JobbedBone> I like the idea of an RPG having quests that are potentially harmful. It shouldn't be compulsory to do everything for everyone to maximize your character. that SHOULD be punished
[5:03:08] <GeoffGeofreed> That's how you play souls
[5:03:09] <+jdjackson31> Yep. If the game gives you a break, take that break.
[5:03:12] <%ChoculaUltra> scumming in style is the play of the game tbh
[5:03:14] <DSD24> Getting a ring out and the game goes "fight properly!"
[5:03:20] <%JobbedBone> as long as its at least hinted
[5:03:23] <@Solidus_113> you cheated not only the game, but yourself. you experienced a hollow victory
[5:03:27] <pmda2126> magic man
[5:03:35] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[5:03:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> BONK THIS MAN
[5:03:47] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Remember that there are 1-hit-KOs programmed into some boss fights in FromSoft games, scumming it out is often the developer intended experience
[5:03:47] <crazzmatazz2> nahhhh screw that scum it out
[5:03:53] <agnetj> @methodialordae I've been subbed to the YouTube channel since it started.
[5:03:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> sheesh
[5:04:03] <DatAsuna> Magic users need to learn when to put it away, yeah
[5:04:04] <ainda_> Reaping his crops!
[5:04:04] <+Grayhammatter> damn, he got that backside
[5:04:05] <+paladinstarbuster> or just hit him

[5:04:34] <MethodiaLordae> Same! I also had the same confusion you had when I was trying to watch the podcast vods, but wasn't even following the other channel, just this one
[5:04:36] <+iseath> iseath subscribed with Prime. 
[5:04:41] <+Mendin> Hey what is that other spell that Reggie has equipped?
[5:04:43] <therealtacopancakes> Isn't the great club easier here?
[5:04:46] <Style_train_14> Keep scumming the game. The game makes no bones about scumming you
[5:04:50] <andre11dr> God damit, i always mess that up
[5:04:55] <%A_German_spy> @Mendin Firespray
[5:05:04] <andiwaffles> @JobbedBone yeah same, I get into the role-playing aspect and these games are super immersive to me. I've done some crazy shit to potentially save NPCs and when it doesn't work out in my favour those are some of the most memorable moments
[5:05:06] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[5:05:13] <+b_aleph> LUL

[5:06:01] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:06:07] <pennykettle_> FeelsBadMan
[5:06:08] <DatAsuna> I'm an istarelle and blind type
[5:06:11] <%cache_22> I will never get tired of Reggie panicking.
[5:06:21] <DatAsuna> I kinda highly doubt we'll see blind in this playthrough tho lol
[5:06:30] <+b_aleph> what comes next, blind giant or manta ray?
[5:06:37] <%A_German_spy> @DatAsuna I'm all about win big or lose big. I don't have the time to plink enemies to death.
[5:06:38] <andiwaffles> blind giant
[5:06:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> giant
[5:06:55] <DSD24> I feel like attacks off screen are always hilarious
[5:07:01] <VoraciousKain> these bones go all the way
[5:07:03] <glass_marcus> This is ideal play tbh
[5:07:03] <+jiggy_snipe> now you're thinking
[5:07:11] <+Mendin> I never understood the rage of the backseaters in this playthrough until woolie has somehow encouraged reggie to fight these with the worst-of-all-worlds weapon in his arsenal NotLikeThis
[5:07:16] <%Deekman> lol
[5:07:25] <+b_aleph> sniped
[5:07:28] <crazzmatazz2> just when you thought
[5:07:36] <+jiggy_snipe> bonk em
[5:08:00] <%Deekman> lmao
[5:08:00] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus karacoLOL
[5:08:03] <andiwaffles> does he have fast roll?
[5:08:08] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[5:08:08] <%cvp5127> LUL
[5:08:09] <VoraciousKain> no
[5:08:18] <+MisleadingEchoes> that was for mendin
[5:08:18] <%SouLucha> woolieONEGUY ?
[5:08:20] <+MisleadingEchoes> hahahah
[5:08:21] <%Deekman> i'm loving this
[5:08:25] <+Rafraud> Did someone get banned lol
[5:08:26] <+Grayhammatter> one guy
[5:08:29] <+paladinstarbuster> mendin is right
[5:08:35] <+MisleadingEchoes> I agree with mendin too
[5:08:35] <DSD24> The Shrine of Storms is no joke
[5:08:38] <Style_train_14> Something that Reggie needs to get used to eventually is knowing whats going on offscreen and keeping track of multiple things at once. It's a skill that takes time obviously but it changes the game completely when you overcome tunnelvision
[5:08:39] <OblivionSword1> Mendin the ONE GUUY
[5:08:39] <+MisleadingEchoes> backseaters are too annoying
[5:08:44] <+Grayhammatter> and dead people
[5:08:47] <DatAsuna> This was the room that slowed me right down my first time
[5:08:53] <+MisleadingEchoes> just let woolie and reggie do their thing and its ok
[5:08:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Mendin with the hot take
[5:08:54] <Zayasu> right
[5:08:58] <Style_train_14> Also this room lessgo
[5:08:59] <andiwaffles> I definitely promote the blind play through experience
[5:08:59] <+Grayhammatter> here we go
[5:08:59] <+b_aleph> wrong!
[5:09:06] <OblivionSword1> Hottest of take
[5:09:09] <user_naim> This is ALL great, you guys and gals included
[5:09:12] <+MisleadingEchoes> they should play this with chat off until the session ends
[5:09:14] <andiwaffles> reminds me of my own awkward, suboptimal runs
[5:09:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> hot take: video games are fun
[5:09:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> Very green
[5:09:27] <%A_German_spy> MY LAZOR
[5:09:28] <OblivionSword1> I forgot these dudes
[5:09:33] <andre11dr> I mean, Woolie did push Reggie to use weapons he can't probably wield in a FO REAL area
[5:09:33] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:09:39] <BlackermanZX> doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[5:09:44] <andiwaffles> I got absolutely massacred in this specific area
[5:09:45] <+Rafraud> we are stronger
[5:09:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Are these the ghosts with a shit ton of retexturing?
[5:09:49] <aGuyFromPleven> that's a cool looking lighting effect though
[5:09:53] <%JobbedBone> unclear hitboxes scare me monkaS
[5:09:53] <+b_aleph> let's gooooooooooo
[5:09:55] <+Mendin> That's a new one.
[5:10:00] <+QueequegTheater> alcove
[5:10:01] <%krispen_wa> oh this room is the worst
[5:10:03] <DatAsuna> that's an older meme, but it checks out
[5:10:13] <+MisleadingEchoes> this room has so much bs
[5:10:18] <BlackermanZX> this room is gonna be gud
[5:10:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> What is going on with their chest texture?
[5:10:20] <DSD24> On your left
[5:10:21] <+Rafraud> oh boy
[5:10:28] <%cvp5127> oh no
[5:10:32] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Yeah the butchers knife's 2-handed running attack is and incredible opening attack
[5:10:33] <andre11dr> That guy is the worst in later NG+
[5:10:33] <+b_aleph> left whom?
[5:10:37] <+Rafraud> noooooooooooo
[5:10:37] <%JobbedBone> ...
[5:10:42] <andiwaffles> that one dude that's hidden made me literally scream lmao
[5:10:54] <andiwaffles> but I think they looked creepier in the OG
[5:11:06] <VoraciousKain> the ghosts or wraithes?
[5:11:09] <+Rafraud> I didn't know there was an item down there
[5:11:09] <+b_aleph> lil peeps
[5:11:15] <andiwaffles> the wraiths
[5:11:15] <%Deekman> the left was telling you about the boy\
[5:11:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> The ghosts are creepier in the OG
[5:11:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> they were less detailed in a good one
[5:11:27] <%cache_22> monkaS
[5:11:27] <+b_aleph> get their forehead diamonds!
[5:11:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> They looked like people. These things have spikes and what not

[5:11:50] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[5:11:51] <+Mendin> Those are somehow ghosts, fishmen, and skeletons at the same time, extra spooky
[5:11:53] <%cache_22> Port or Starboard?
[5:11:53] <andiwaffles> idk maybe it was the sound the wraiths made, there was something off-putting about them

[5:14:53] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That stupid-ass laser is hitscan. It goes through walls and can still hit you even if you're behind something.
[5:14:55] <+b_aleph> You're already better than Pat, Reggie. GG

[5:15:40] <+MisleadingEchoes> Maximilian farmed this place after finishing the boss, it is a great area for farming.

[5:15:41] <agnetj> THE BACKDOWN

[5:15:45] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You know what? I think that's a good call.
[5:15:46] <Style_train_14> BUY GRASS
[5:15:48] <VoraciousKain> 4-2 is short
[5:15:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> but then you do gotta fight your way all the way back
[5:15:52] <glass_marcus> fiscal responsibility
[5:15:52] <DatAsuna> reggie got his kneepads
[5:15:54] <Tuna_Can_0> let him suffer 😡
[5:15:56] <andiwaffles> I mean he'd probs die on that second cliff
[5:15:57] <DatAsuna> strapping his helment on
[5:16:01] <%Amaideus> Doesn't he have an item to warp back?
[5:16:01] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus make sure he takes that off before the boss for funsies
[5:16:04] <+QueequegTheater> @ReallyBigRocks he knows where the summoners are though
[5:16:06] <linSP> prolong the pain reggie
[5:16:09] <%emperordread> Lame it out like X-Tekken
[5:16:09] <Kiras86> LOL
[5:16:09] <+Rafraud> Fair
[5:16:10] <OblivionSword1> Curfew almost upon us ?
[5:16:11] <+jiggy_snipe> call it
[5:16:13] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[5:16:15] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Reggie can sleep over
[5:16:20] <andre11dr> Nah 4-2 is definitely one of the longer ones
[5:16:22] <user_naim> G R A S S U P
[5:16:24] <andiwaffles> what's the curfew in Montreal?
[5:16:28] <+Rafraud> I wish US curfew was as strict as yours
[5:16:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> @QueequegTheater I'm more worried about those skeletons tho tbh
[5:16:34] <andiwaffles> we had a curfew for a bit in Melbourne AU
[5:16:35] <Kiras86> Tight though for curfew, don't get the boss done before
[5:16:41] <VoraciousKain> 1-1 is still longer than 4-2
[5:16:51] <Kiras86> don't think he has enough time*
[5:16:53] <+QueequegTheater> @Rafraud California tried but it literally didn't work
[5:16:58] <+kevlarkoala> "I'm sorry officer. I know i'm out late but you see, my soul BURNED for more"
[5:17:00] <VoraciousKain> its medium at best
[5:17:02] <Tuna_Can_0> just sleepover distComfy
[5:17:10] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Don't think we've had any curfews in Ontario
[5:17:17] <crazzmatazz2> oh that takes me back to project M vibes
[5:17:26] <%Amaideus> Y'all hear Florida might get travel banned?
[5:17:29] <andiwaffles> I should play P+
[5:17:31] <VoraciousKain> good
[5:17:34] <+b_aleph> gotta cash that cash money
[5:17:34] <crazzmatazz2> + is legittttt
[5:17:41] <+MisleadingEchoes> Flashing Lights yoshi Island? Couldn't find what is that?
[5:17:42] <crazzmatazz2> knuckles hype is real
[5:17:54] <pmda2126> well, he will be stronger coming back
[5:18:00] <+QueequegTheater> @Amaideus That would be completely unenforceable
[5:18:03] <DatAsuna> I really love worlds 4 and 5
[5:18:16] <andre11dr> 5 is a cool concept
[5:18:16] <VoraciousKain> I don't care for 5
[5:18:19] <andiwaffles> I've just been trying to not suck at melee
[5:18:22] <andre11dr> But fuck 5
[5:18:31] <+QueequegTheater> Planes? Sure, but stopping all vehicle traffic? Florida has a fucking LOT of borders
[5:18:37] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I didn't have much trouble with 5.
[5:18:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:18:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> Buy some grass for god's sake
[5:18:38] <DatAsuna> 5 has all my fave NPCs
[5:18:41] <%cache_22> woolieONEGUY strikes again :(
[5:18:44] <DatAsuna> and weapons
[5:18:44] <+GilroyGoldBlood> I had the most trouble with 1-3
[5:18:46] <%Jashter18> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[5:18:47] <+jiggy_snipe> One Guys
[5:18:52] <+QueequegTheater> Mendin the One Guy
[5:18:55] <+Grayhammatter> one guy strikes again
[5:18:59] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie has brain and can think for himself
[5:19:03] <+jiggy_snipe> he'
[5:19:05] <%LordSDB> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[5:19:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Can he?
[5:19:08] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What do you need more dex for?
[5:19:09] <+Mendin> Hey I said worst -for that one specific situation-, not in general
[5:19:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[5:19:11] <andiwaffles> @Grayhammatter hahahahahahaha trueeeee
[5:19:24] <+Rafraud> I mean right now, he can use most weapons
[5:19:26] <VoraciousKain> reggie is the muscle, woolie is the brains
[5:19:28] <+paladinstarbuster> reggie doesnt know enough to choose so with the info hes given hell just do what woolie says
[5:19:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Souls brings that out in people.
[5:19:31] <VoraciousKain> wait that ain't right
[5:19:31] <andiwaffles> like 95% of us are fine with it
[5:19:39] <+jiggy_snipe> if Reggie didn't like those weapons, he wouldn't use them
[5:19:48] <+b_aleph> Use the assault rifle!!!
[5:19:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> But he tends to do things you suggest for him
[5:19:49] <CappuccinoGuil> But you HAVE to pick a direction, Reggie
[5:19:50] <%emperordread> I for one like concise Woolie tbh woolieSPICE
[5:20:00] <user_naim> DeS: Become Pat
[5:20:08] <bobxmaker> as is i think it's in the position to decide what he wants, dex, strength or both.
[5:20:11] <VoraciousKain> become huge
[5:20:11] <%Javaa01> Or use the meat cleaver, since that's already a Quality weapon
[5:20:14] <andiwaffles> this isn't a Partizan situation :p for the record I thought that was dumb to whine about too
[5:20:19] <%Jashter18> I here for Reggie experiencing the game and Woolie's howling laughter when he fails but also his hyped yells when he does the thing!
[5:20:20] <%Javaa01> S/S is as good as it gets
[5:20:26] <%Javaa01> For Quality
[5:20:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> the point in strength is useless right now
[5:20:48] <%JobbedBone> would the faith investment for the req be worth the damage it unlocks?
[5:20:50] <+paladinstarbuster> woolie should be telling himto pump magic
[5:20:54] <+MisleadingEchoes> Whatever man just invest in luck and let it be it
[5:21:00] <%JobbedBone> for the cleaver
[5:21:02] <+Rafraud> From crossing fate
[5:21:04] <DatAsuna> Woolie truly is the bearer of the curse
[5:21:05] <%Cozy90> CANT ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FATE
[5:21:08] <+b_aleph> FOR GLORY!
[5:21:16] <roarofdamnation> He can always lvl up magic yeah!
[5:21:21] <agnetj> FOR FUN!
[5:21:21] <Pyrrhus90> all luck boys lets go
[5:21:24] <+MisleadingEchoes> That is bullshit blazing
[5:21:28] <crazzmatazz2> the return of lucky ted
[5:21:35] <+MisleadingEchoes> Can't wait for maneater fight with a quality build
[5:21:35] <VoraciousKain> finally, lucky ted is viable
[5:21:39] <andiwaffles> I used the shotel for literally the whole game im not judging :p
[5:21:41] <VoraciousKain> oh boy
[5:21:44] <+paladinstarbuster> otherwise hell just be shooting pebbles
[5:21:48] <+b_aleph> woolie vs ps5
[5:21:58] <user_naim> Buy 1m^3 of grass
[5:22:00] <%Javaa01> Accessories
[5:22:01] <MethodiaLordae> goblinPls
[5:22:07] <%JobbedBone> my controller acted strange for the first few days but somehow got better
[5:22:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Woolie vs QA
[5:22:18] <VoraciousKain> can you still item dup with tomas?
[5:22:24] <+MisleadingEchoes> No matter your build, first playthrough against maneater is a pain
[5:22:31] <Pyrrhus90> aah yes, woolie and the eternal QA loop
[5:22:42] <crazzmatazz2> *reggie stumbles into a foggy ruin, sitting across from him is lucky ted, now an old bitter man
[5:22:46] <Pyrrhus90> he will never reach the truth
[5:22:49] <andiwaffles> @MisleadingEchoes I've only played this, DS1 and BB and I died to Maneater more than any other boss
[5:22:53] <roarofdamnation> Gotta put those pew pew pew to good use and lvl up dat magic.
[5:23:01] <crazzmatazz2> *reggie holds out his broadsword in anticipation; lucky ted tosses it behind him
[5:23:20] <+MisleadingEchoes> @andiwaffles you are gonna have fun if you ever play DS2 against Fume Knight
[5:23:25] <SilverFaustX> magic is OP
[5:23:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Stamina also increased item load, might be able to roll with DBS eventually
[5:23:34] <%JobbedBone> OpieOP
[5:23:45] <Tuna_Can_0> Vitality build Kappa
[5:23:49] <VoraciousKain> when havel ring
[5:24:07] <MethodiaLordae> Reggie's doing NG?
[5:24:10] <user_naim> resin fer DeSin
[5:24:12] <andiwaffles> @MisleadingEchoes foreboding :O
[5:24:14] <DatAsuna> Only if you care about having the strongest build
[5:24:17] <VoraciousKain> ng yes
[5:24:18] <%Amaideus> On first run it doesn't really matter
[5:24:21] <DatAsuna> not being optimal is fine
[5:24:22] <DSD24> Ey level 50
[5:24:26] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That doesn't matter on a first playthrough. Run One is for trying stuff out, and to do that, you pretty much need to level your stats evenly.
[5:24:27] <+MisleadingEchoes> Everyone I saw playing this remake used Butchers and Dragonbone, kinda bored to see them not gonna lie.
[5:24:39] <+paladinstarbuster> hell get to the point where his magic is useless but hell hit fine
[5:24:45] <roarofdamnation> He could go for that luck based build, get everything to 18
[5:24:45] <therealtacopancakes> pump everything to 30 and solved
[5:25:06] <+Mendin> I have nothing against Reggie trying out whatever weapons he wants.
[5:25:10] <%JobbedBone> show him the blueblood trick Kappa
[5:25:10] <andiwaffles> first blind playthroughs are always jank
[5:25:10] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie plz
[5:25:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So it's fine. You don't need to worry about optimizing.
[5:25:16] <+jiggy_snipe> don't be rude
[5:25:19] <VoraciousKain> time for toilet
[5:25:31] <+Mendin> I just resent being called OneGuy over pointing out that a 2h Slash/Magic weapon is literally the worst of reggie's arsenal against the sksletons
[5:25:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie wasn't some security
[5:25:37] <+MisleadingEchoes> respec hahahahhaha
[5:25:37] <Tuna_Can_0> 2H shield :)
[5:25:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:25:42] <+Grayhammatter> reggie wants some security
[5:25:46] <%Javaa01> What respec
[5:25:56] <%Javaa01> They hadn't invented that yet
[5:25:58] <+MisleadingEchoes> What respect Reggie? There's no such thing
[5:26:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Fuck this regen shit. Get a good 100% shield and stock up on grass. Problem solved
[5:26:22] <roarofdamnation> He can always play naked tho
[5:26:34] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie doesn't wanna be naked
[5:26:37] <%cvp5127> :)
[5:26:38] <+MisleadingEchoes> Rapier and Parry shield is for real man
[5:26:42] <OblivionSword1> Chat just let Reggie plays
[5:26:49] <user_naim> ooh that delicious grass
[5:26:52] <roarofdamnation> But the people want to see some skin!
[5:26:53] <Tuna_Can_0> ☝ this is bad advice, and this is bad advice 👇
[5:26:54] <+paladinstarbuster> what keigan said
[5:26:54] <OblivionSword1> IT'S FINE
[5:26:56] <MethodiaLordae> Reggie's doing FINE
[5:26:59] <+QueequegTheater> I need my grasses
[5:27:03] <andre11dr> lose clothes, gain viewers
[5:27:09] <%SouLucha> No need for perfection, this isn't a pro run. Ignore woolieONEGUY
[5:27:10] <VoraciousKain> put your grasses on
[5:27:13] <+jiggy_snipe> these suggestions would mean more if Reggie was failing
[5:27:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> get him a good shield and let him see what it's like
[5:27:16] <Tuna_Can_0> @andre11dr Kreygasm good advice
[5:27:31] <crazzmatazz2> @WoolieVersus Also, Reggie, you guys are creating some quality content as always. As a long time fan, I'm always glad to see the hype panning out. This is the good good
[5:27:37] <+MisleadingEchoes> If a nipple ain't showing it's not worth playing
[5:27:55] <andre11dr> But not for us ,cause there's this part
[5:27:56] <MethodiaLordae> good session!
[5:27:58] <%justcallmebobplease> It's strange being able to see Woolie's pores.
[5:27:59] <+paladinstarbuster> always fun
[5:28:01] <+Grayhammatter> one area a session technically
[5:28:01] <%justcallmebobplease> Is this Yakuza?
[5:28:01] <+MisleadingEchoes> Why don't Reggie speedrun in his first lp?
[5:28:02] <nailwind> this was a great sesh
[5:28:05] <roarofdamnation> @MisleadingEchoes If a nipple aint showing it's not worth watching!
[5:28:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> ZUBAZ!!!
[5:28:15] <therealtacopancakes> Thanks for stream guys <3
[5:28:22] <agnetj> <3 <3 <3
[5:28:23] <VoraciousKain> woolies pores are just entrances to the woolie hole
[5:28:23] <Tuna_Can_0> 2/10 run too many clothes 😡
[5:28:25] <+MisleadingEchoes> I think it's absurd that reggie didn't go naked with club in his first lp
[5:28:30] <%JobbedBone> the logo in the reflection PogChamp
[5:28:36] <%jonblnt> Great Stream guys
[5:28:36] <andre11dr> Im shocked that Dragon God took 3 hours
[5:28:36] <+darklyte510> Well done Reggie, well done.
[5:28:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> Mon's Souls
[5:28:39] <+MisleadingEchoes> Why reggie didn't level 1 run?
[5:28:40] <geodood> i like this double camera setup! doodGood
[5:28:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> A lot sooner lol
[5:29:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you think he'd beat 5-2 faster?
[5:29:28] <andre11dr> That glitch was fucking gold tho
[5:29:28] <VoraciousKain> no
[5:29:33] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Dragon God can TOTALLY be a wall
[5:29:36] <%Amaideus> Dragon God is ASS
[5:29:38] <+jiggy_snipe> we got that bug tho so all good
[5:29:40] <+MisleadingEchoes> Man I really want reggie playing all souls, CANT WAIT FOR BLOODBORNE
[5:29:43] <%Amaideus> It's a bottom 5 boss in the series
[5:29:49] <%Amaideus> IT SUCKS
[5:29:53] <@Solidus_113> Bloodborne in 2024
[5:29:53] <+Grayhammatter> it sucks
[5:29:55] <%Javaa01> Yeah, DeS goes by far the hardest on gimmick bosses
[5:30:02] <VoraciousKain> its sucks as in its lame but not awful
[5:30:03] <%SouLucha> That glitch was CONTENT tho
[5:30:20] <roarofdamnation> Miwako and Ogata OTP?
[5:30:20] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Javaa01 disagree, that would be DS3 where there's 5 gimmicky main bosses
[5:30:22] <andre11dr> At least Rat King dies fast
[5:30:37] <+MisleadingEchoes> Demon Souls only has Dragon God and Storm King as gimmick bosses
[5:30:41] <DSD24> He punches you so hard
[5:30:45] <%Amaideus> Tower Knight
[5:30:51] <%Amaideus> Arguably 3-3's
[5:30:57] <%Amaideus> Fool's Idol
[5:30:58] <%WutangchickeN> Yo Woolz, took a few months longer than I wanted but finally dumped cash on a new PC through your Artesian Builds links, cheers for that. just a heads up they changed what your promo code does so you might wanna look into that. HMU later if you want quick details.
[5:31:01] <+MisleadingEchoes> Tower Knight isn't gimmick
[5:31:06] <%Javaa01> @MisleadingEchoes And Phalanx, and Tower Knight, and Fools Idol
[5:31:10] <townzzzzz> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[5:31:12] <%Javaa01> And the list goes on
[5:31:13] <andre11dr> 3-3 is more of straight up fight
[5:31:17] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Don't be sorry! That fight is obtuse and it sucks.
[5:31:21] <%Javaa01> The DeS gimmick boss list is looong
[5:31:24] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Javaa01 I don't think Tower Knight or Phalanx are gimmicky bosses.
[5:31:26] <%jonblnt> hilarity, frustration, and a lot of level ups, couldn't ask for more
[5:31:29] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, and Storm Ruler
[5:31:30] <roarofdamnation> That Dragon God was golden tho, that bug exposing play.
[5:31:33] <%Seancicle> gotta jet ily
[5:31:34] <VoraciousKain> king allant still has the best gimmick attack of all

[5:31:36] <+MisleadingEchoes> They are real fights
[5:31:39] <%Amaideus> Sorry
[5:31:41] <%Amaideus> I meant 3-4
[5:31:45] <%Amaideus> I think
[5:31:52] <%Amaideus> Ye olde big hat
[5:31:56] <Darren716> Man I can't wait for Reggie vs BoC
[5:31:59] <Tuna_Can_0> reggie is pure, never be sorry distH
[5:32:03] <andre11dr> Storm King is the best puzzle boss in Souls ease
[5:32:08] <%Javaa01> @MisleadingEchoes No, they really are not, once you know what to do, there is effectively no challenge
[5:32:20] <+MisleadingEchoes> Storm King is just so you have a fuckin cool sword and in this remaster it looks so good
[5:32:25] <MethodiaLordae> Here it comes
[5:32:30] <%Javaa01> Even Gwen has the reaction speed test of hitting the parry
[5:32:31] <%ezgoldar> ezgoldar subscribed with Prime. 
[5:32:31] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Javaa01 you just described any boss fight at all.
[5:32:37] <%Amaideus> Nah
[5:32:49] <%Amaideus> Puzzle bosses are extra susceptible to it
[5:32:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:32:56] <%Amaideus> Because the execution usually is braindead
[5:33:05] <@Solidus_113> you can do it at lvl 1
[5:33:15] <%Amaideus> In straight up manfights, even when you know what to do you can still easily fuck it up
[5:33:28] <%Amaideus> Unless it's Pinwheel, kek
[5:33:46] <%Amaideus> Puzzle bosses are basically just running down a check list most of the time
[5:33:49] <+MisleadingEchoes> Dragon King you can do without any equipment or levels, that's a gimmick boss
[5:33:55] <+MisleadingEchoes> Dragon God*
[5:33:57] <%Amaideus> Also Astrea is definitely a gimmick boss
[5:33:59] <VoraciousKain> prowling magus and congregation is worse than pinwheel
[5:34:09] <%Amaideus> I've seen people die to congregation
[5:34:09] <andre11dr> Im interested to see how Reggie will deal with the 3-2 boss ,because that was a wall to me
[5:34:14] <VoraciousKain> lol
[5:34:19] <%Amaideus> I've still NEVER seen anyone die to pinwheel
[5:34:21] <+MisleadingEchoes> @Amaideus Viland is the real boss.
[5:34:27] <%Javaa01> Pinwheel has an actual moveset, it's just that no one ever sees it because you just hit him like 3-5 times and he dies in 10 seconds flat
[5:34:34] <%Amaideus> And I watch way too many souls LPs
[5:34:35] <VoraciousKain> @amaideus woolie died to him
[5:34:37] <%A_German_spy> A_German_spy gifted a Tier 1 sub to Solidus_113! 
[5:34:44] <%Amaideus> To pinwheel?
[5:34:45] <VoraciousKain> or was it pat?
[5:34:46] <KaiserMario> @Amaideus Woolie...
[5:34:46] <+MisleadingEchoes> Woolie died to pinwheel
[5:34:54] <VoraciousKain> well then there you go
[5:34:54] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM
[5:34:56] <%Amaideus> No he didn't
[5:34:58] <pmda2126> youre doing fine
[5:34:59] <GeoffGeofreed> Good Job Reggie! Don't be too hard on yourself especially on those Dragon God runs, that was a shit boss anyways. Although I suggest you not stretch your levels too much, focus on a few offensive stats, it will make the game easier.
[5:35:07] <%Amaideus> He killed pinwheel and went "that was pathetic"
[5:35:13] <Tuna_Can_0> BJ practice Kreygasm
[5:35:14] <andre11dr> Roll good
[5:35:14] <+MisleadingEchoes> one of the friends died to pinwheel
[5:35:20] <%Amaideus> It would've had to be Pat
[5:35:24] <andre11dr> Get those leg locks
[5:35:25] <+MisleadingEchoes> Pat or Paige then
[5:35:30] <%Amaideus> Definitely wasn't Woolie, I remember that moment
[5:35:31] <VoraciousKain> pat then
[5:35:39] <SeniorTop> It's great that he is doing the playthrough with minimal guidance, it's a joy to watch him learn (patches moment).

[5:35:52] <roarofdamnation> Reggo the preggo, every episode we go further down the kink hole.

[5:38:10] <andre11dr> 99 luck is actually a thing now because buggs
[5:38:10] <%Amaideus> Just don't go to like 25+ in each stat

[5:38:23] <%jonblnt> it's an LP, spread the stats
[5:38:25] <%Amaideus> But if something catches your idea, go look for it
