[0:18:28] <aiutare47> @woolieversus there will be icons on the side of your in game screen that will allow chat to buff you temporarily or let chat vote on dialogue
[0:18:28] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> If you hover over the stream it shows the extension is active
[0:18:29] <mariothemaio> on the side of the window, it pops up an icon to show the disco elysium icon
[0:18:29] <%nicversus> it's a little pop up when you mouse over the screen on desktop
[0:18:30] <leith_aziz> There's a square on the right

[0:19:06] <%nicversus> we only see you
[0:19:08] <%nicversus> no gameplay
[0:19:10] <%hax_metatron> Imagine a multiplayer version of Disco Elysium where you had a stat that was basically other players guiding you
[0:19:14] <%illusiveSaint> btw chat can only engage on desktop @woolieversus
[0:19:15] <+Orrjekt> Phoneposters go home

[0:20:30] <drunken_lemur> No audio
[0:20:31] <%nicversus> there's no game audio
[0:20:31] <andre11dr> Ok so im looking at it on my phone but it doesn't load like in my desktop stream
[0:20:32] <Johannen> No audio
[0:20:32] <%Irridium> no game audio?
[0:20:33] <%AyotoCorp> @WoolieVersus Is it turned on?
[0:20:33] <%the_Punktuation> no game audio
[0:20:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i don't think it's working
[0:20:35] <Dogking16> There's no game audio
[0:20:38] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> No Audio yeah
[0:20:39] <%servicesuspension> you have to enable it in the menu btw
[0:20:41] <iacus_> Is it enabled in-game?
[0:20:41] <%servicesuspension> also, no audio
[0:20:41] <Deasmeister> Not working
[0:20:43] <+Vivaciousx3> is the setting in disco elysium on?
[0:20:43] <Dogking16> ok
[0:20:45] <derap41> Doesn't work
[0:20:46] <%nicversus> good now
[0:20:47] <picanoturna> its good gere
[0:20:51] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> did you not put the token into the options in game?
[0:20:52] <%holydeviant1> Maybe ask Pat about it?
[0:20:53] <%the_Punktuation> not on
[0:20:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you also need to go into game settings
[0:20:56] <Johannen> Is game option for that turned on?
[0:20:59] <aiutare47> The buttons aren’t showing it’s not on
[0:21:04] <%Juriasu> it's connected but not enabled?
[0:21:05] <pennykettle_> yeah did the token get reentered
[0:21:07] <Deasmeister> It's not on
[0:21:10] <%nicversus> usually the options show up on the right side next to the dialogue box, you may need to restart the game
[0:21:15] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> you have to go into ingame options and put the token in
[0:21:15] <%the_Punktuation> icon should appear on the side
[0:21:17] <%Irridium> it also doesn't show up in every dialog just so you know
[0:21:18] <andre11dr> Yeah you need to enable it in the game
[0:21:30] <%X2Eliah> hmmmmm
[0:21:37] <foxname96> @woolieversus Restart the game probably
[0:21:39] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> he put the token from the extension in right?  NOT his twitch token
[0:21:40] <linSP> firewall?
[0:21:43] <%AyotoCorp> It should have the button to change stats all the time, if it's not there then it's not on
[0:21:46] <aiutare47> There will be two buttons on the side of your in game screen when it’s working
[0:21:47] <ronin19xx> Its on though in the game, the toggle
[0:21:49] <+Undenizen> oh wow, i caught a stream!
[0:21:50] <pennykettle_> "you need to add the extension to your channel. THAT will give you the token which you then add to the game client. then you click the speech bubble on the right to give chat the chance to vote. however, the timer is a little short, so I find it best to give them a minute to read the options before I push the vote button."
[0:21:55] <%Juriasu> yeah restarting seems good
[0:21:56] <+Undenizen> still catching up on the last one
[0:21:57] <%DevilHands_> There should be two extra buttons in game on the side. Try restarting the game
[0:21:58] <andre11dr> Maybe restart
[0:22:12] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[0:22:14] <pennykettle_> SourPls
[0:22:23] <gamewarden92> Is this what's it's like to build communism?

[0:23:05] <%servicesuspension> cringe yourself to death, get a medal for it
[0:23:06] <+Vivaciousx3> i believe you still decide the final answer, you just see our suggestions
[0:23:08] <AngryAsian5> All we can do is influence LUL
[0:23:10] <%hax_metatron> I can guarantee you 99% of the time chat will pick boring answers as majority LUL
[0:23:10] <elshadow7> Did I miss something?

[0:23:32] <%ChoculaUltra> rip
[0:23:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Do you see two extra buttons
[0:23:34] <Johannen> Shame
[0:23:37] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> huh, mine always connects super fast...
[0:23:40] <elshadow7> Ooh, nice...
[0:23:41] <%Theycallmenerf> %any chat run
[0:23:45] <derap41> Should just take a second
[0:23:45] <Johannen> Whatever..lots of streams ahead
[0:23:47] <%X2Eliah> Welp this doesn't work, time to go to another game
[0:23:49] <%hax_metatron> @heemwizard It has the best ending so yes
[0:23:50] <andre11dr> Today well all become woolieONEGUY woolieGLORY
[0:23:55] <%PMAvers> Windows Defender isn't blocking it or something weird right?
[0:23:55] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Did you ask Pat how he got it to work?
[0:24:06] <Johannen> Did Pat do it?
[0:24:12] <%X2Eliah> Pat super did it
[0:24:13] <%JustYudha> I think Pat figured it out on stream
[0:24:19] <%Theycallmenerf> What if Twitch did Twitch plays Disco Elysium
[0:24:21] <Wahrow> Call Pat?
[0:24:21] <Fuji808> paaaaaaaaaaaat
[0:24:22] <%X2Eliah> Woolie might need to call pat
[0:24:23] <pennykettle_> when you are in a convo, is there an icon with 3 bars on the right? The twitch choices arent always on, you pick when to turn it on
[0:24:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can see the extension on twitch but the stat screen isn't there
[0:24:24] <Johannen> Next stream maybe after asking PAt
[0:24:27] <%dalmek> trunk it for next stream?
[0:24:30] <%servicesuspension> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION

[0:25:03] <%servicesuspension> To be fair, everything around Disco is a little janky
[0:25:03] <Indigo_Automaton> They still have the whole game to try it so it's no biggie
[0:25:03] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @JustYudha god, I can hear the mustard one everytime someone  writes it
[0:25:08] <%DevilHands_> I believe
[0:25:09] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Brutal hit
[0:25:18] <aiutare47> That fucking hit
[0:25:25] <+mechslayer71> That shady ass hit
[0:25:26] <%illusiveSaint> i think maybe we see it when you start playing?
[0:25:31] <%X2Eliah> Oh nice
[0:25:38] <aiutare47> Square in the jaw too
[0:25:39] <DoctorAvens> maxiumum fucking velocity some might say
[0:25:40] <%hax_metatron> I swear as I get older and it takes longer than it used to for me to diagnose software problems, it’s a real morale hit
[0:25:41] <+Dova573> Oh He had FULL AGRRO
[0:25:41] <mariothemaio> MAXIMUM VELOCITY
[0:25:46] <%X2Eliah> Hockey is a brutal sport with legally encouraged fisticuffs
[0:25:49] <andre11dr> Hokie seems cool because the violence
[0:25:50] <%nicversus> Full impact hockey violence
[0:25:51] <primaryfire> thoughts on naomi osaka leaving the french open?
[0:25:56] <+abrupt_abe> Dirty ass hit
[0:26:03] <+mechslayer71> Landed on his neck
[0:26:06] <%X2Eliah> 5 minutes xD
[0:26:07] <%X2Eliah> wow
[0:26:14] <%SirGO0SE> George Parros has no clue what he's doing
[0:26:27] <%SirGO0SE> he should have expelled Tom Wilson from the league too
[0:26:30] <%Theycallmenerf> How are players who do that shit not fucking banned?
[0:26:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> 5gs for a Murder
[0:26:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WE NEED BLOODSPORT - Pat
[0:26:52] <%SirGO0SE> If they got rid of fighting in hockey the sport would be more dangerous
[0:26:57] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> This is what happens when you hire George Parros, a former goon with clothing line called Violent Gentleman, as your fucking head of player safety
[0:26:59] <spaceitaly> the rink demands a blood sacrifice
[0:27:00] <%Juriasu> LUL
[0:27:01] <%OblivionSword1> Does anyone ever get penalized for fighting in hockey ?
[0:27:02] <%SirGO0SE> The fighting keeps people from doing shit like happened to Evans
[0:27:02] <elshadow7> jfc...
[0:27:05] <aiutare47> I don’t like the rangers but that was the biggest dick shit in hockey I’ve seen in a while.
[0:27:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh god that article
[0:27:10] <gamewarden92> What?
[0:27:10] <%JustYudha> RACE NORMING THAT SHIT KILLED ME
[0:27:12] <%servicesuspension> Hey chat, South American here. Is hockey as much of a bloodsport as media shows?
[0:27:16] <%Theycallmenerf> What
[0:27:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NFL WILDING
[0:27:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh god that shit was fucked
[0:27:19] <elshadow7> Is that better or worse? LUL
[0:27:24] <%Theycallmenerf> What the fuck is race morning?
[0:27:24] <%kullumanati> Race netcode
[0:27:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:27:26] <%Seancicle> que? run that back.
[0:27:28] <WeepyDevil> what the fuck is race norming
[0:27:30] <%Theycallmenerf> *norming?
[0:27:30] <+mechslayer71> Not enough blacks for that specific form of racism to rear its head
[0:27:36] <+abrupt_abe> 'No systemic racism' RACE NORMING
[0:27:38] <%hax_metatron> Did Reggie just say Race Normie? LUL
[0:27:42] <%Theycallmenerf> Oh
[0:27:44] <aiutare47> @servicesuspension not as bad as you’d think, still pretty rough. A lot of speed and anger.
[0:27:49] <andre11dr> Oh yeah,the race norming LUL
[0:27:52] <%illusiveSaint> its controlled fighting Kappa
[0:27:59] <%servicesuspension> Measurehead scoffs at Race Normies
[0:28:01] <+mechslayer71> The nfl was using the assumption that black players start at lower cognitive function in order to Denise settlements for CtE
[0:28:06] <%X2Eliah> @WeepyDevil It's wild stuff, look it up. Basically they had different criteria for "normal cognitive level" based on the player's race, to assess CTE damage etc
[0:28:07] <derap41> Hockey is all brawling
[0:28:10] <+mechslayer71> Denie*
[0:28:11] <derap41> that's the good stuff
[0:28:13] <andre11dr> Well isn't assault part of the sport?
[0:28:17] <%SirGO0SE> Scheifele is and always has been scum tbf
[0:28:17] <+mechslayer71> Deny*
[0:28:18] <%OblivionSword1> Why is fist fight even legal in hockey in the first place ?
[0:28:19] <%holydeviant1> Like, there's a reason for all that padding
[0:28:44] <%X2Eliah> @OblivionSword1 Always was present historically, I guess
[0:28:46] <%OblivionSword1> like other sports don't do this type of shits
[0:28:49] <%SirGO0SE> @OblivionSword1 without it, the sport is so high paced and high impact that it can't be policed by refs.
[0:28:59] <derap41> @OblivionSword1 Its with full padding and usually gloves
[0:29:00] <derap41> Full body with gloves and padding is just
[0:29:20] <%SirGO0SE> the message is "dont do things that hurt worse than punches to the face, or we throw down" generally
[0:29:21] <derap41> Think I might have gotten some of that damage
[0:29:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> Sounds like American Football
[0:29:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> Look why shouldn't a 226 lb man be able to fly into another if their wearing armor
[0:29:40] <%OblivionSword1> even with all that padding it's still not a really good look on the sport itself
[0:29:50] <%X2Eliah> @SirGO0SE Yeah but that's the thing, you break the other guy's neck in the first roll, he cannot punch back
[0:29:52] <%illusiveSaint> the opposite happened with the nba where it's a lot less physical and changed the game overall
[0:30:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> The padding makes the hits worse because they don't hold back
[0:30:07] <%nicversus> on the streets that's aggravated assault
[0:30:11] <derap41> Concisions comes from G-forces not how hard it hits
[0:30:12] <%JustYudha> I've heard people using the risk of injuries as why they get paid so much money
[0:30:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> rather it CAN make them worse
[0:30:22] <%Juriasu> heat the key?
[0:30:24] <KaiserMario> Reset stream LUL
[0:30:27] <andre11dr> My problem with the collision in American Football and Hokie is that you get blindsided at full speed, in actually fighting you get to always see the other guy and avoid damage
[0:30:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Don't be surprised if that dude who got hit dyes his mustache blonde and makes a music video
[0:30:43] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE yeah. the problem isnt fighting, its the dirty hits.
[0:30:44] <%hax_metatron> It works!
[0:30:53] <%DashXero> DashXero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! I am enjoying the stream.
[0:30:55] <derap41> Shove it deep in there
[0:31:00] <derap41> For Honour
[0:31:02] <%SirGO0SE> id rather get punched in the face then driven head first into the boards at 20 mph
[0:31:06] <KaiserMario> It's not working right, you need to see his stats
[0:31:07] <Fuji808> Fighting is what keeps dirty hits in check.
[0:31:19] <%Juriasu> maybe restart stream with plugin already enabled? @WoolieVersus
[0:31:27] <%SirGO0SE> @Fuji808 yep, thats the sentiment
[0:31:29] <%X2Eliah> When fighting is the *only thing* keeping dirty hits in check, you have a fundamental problem
[0:31:31] <pennykettle_> @Juriasu possibly
[0:31:40] <%servicesuspension> So, you add the extension to your channel. Then that gives you a token that you put in the game.
[0:31:46] <mariothemaio> maybe get into convo with titus and see if you get any options
[0:31:48] <primaryfire> I vaguely remember pat restarting the stream
[0:31:51] <%servicesuspension> I kinda get it but I kinda don't
[0:31:54] <%SirGO0SE> @X2Eliah there need to be more and better linesman and a more agressive player safety division like Reggie said
[0:31:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> I mean what do you wanna do get the refs in there with maces
[0:31:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Breaking shit up
[0:32:05] <%hax_metatron> Go to your twitch plugins, and set it as active as overlay 1.
[0:32:09] <%SirGO0SE> because its for sure getting out of hand
[0:32:23] <gfbagel> yeah make people swordfight with the refs
[0:32:25] <spaceitaly> windows-g
[0:32:29] <aiutare47> Current hockey league safety is beyond a joke and into dangerously incompetent
[0:32:40] <%SirGO0SE> @Pookiedaexzile maced and red pilled LUL
[0:32:45] <derap41> Are you using the right token?
[0:33:04] <%X2Eliah> It seems like the game is not linking correctly for some raisin
[0:33:04] <%illusiveSaint> in contrast in nba its common for players to fish for fouls and flop injuries for points lately
[0:33:06] <%hax_metatron> Woolie can't escape QA
[0:33:10] <derap41> its active on the twitch side
[0:33:26] <%Seancicle> やまた？
[0:33:40] <%servicesuspension> Closing everything and crying
[0:33:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> Check the other settings?
[0:33:43] <briskythechicken> nba been flopping progressively more for a decade now
[0:33:45] <derap41> turn it on and off again
[0:33:46] <+TheotherKristian> I must be patient, this twitch integration will be S U P E R W O R T H I T
[0:33:46] <Fuji808> Could be both fighting AND heavy fines and suspensions for dirty hits. if you're rich and well sponsored as a player, it becomes a fee for rich players to get away with more while poor players fear getting taxed and play softer. Fighting, ironically, is the most democratic deal.
[0:33:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> integrate me, hard reset
[0:33:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> put me in the system woolz
[0:33:56] <%DiscoMatador> Torn it off then back on again?
[0:33:57] <%illusiveSaint> i thought he was gonna say time to call pat LUL
[0:34:01] <%hax_metatron> Oh yeah def. the game needs to be restarted if you create a new token in the middle
[0:34:06] <%Zero_Jacks> ??? wait why are they going back in time
[0:34:12] <%X2Eliah> Restart steam, restart stream, then restart dream of getting it to work
[0:34:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> we must restart the simulation
[0:34:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:34:31] <%Zero_Jacks> Man.
[0:34:33] <andre11dr> Just shove my brain into your computer, im sure it will work
[0:34:37] <%SirGO0SE> @Fuji808 even then, 99% of the players follow "the code" when it comes to fighting, but the 1% who don't are in headlines constantly and need to be tossed
[0:34:39] <Indigo_Automaton> If there was a lore explanation for the Twitch integration would that make us voices from the pale?
[0:34:44] <LlewynMarie> cute mug
[0:34:46] <%DashXero> Are they having trouble getting the game to boot?

[0:37:40] <elshadow7> Ooh they got integration working! Cool.
[0:37:51] <%OblivionSword1> software failure gives me anxiety
[0:37:52] <seniormeatbox> Computers just not processing a bit until restarting is too damn common
[0:37:55] <%SirGO0SE> oh shit the twitch integration is on!
[0:37:56] <%emperordread> Software is miraculously complex, when you rub dozens against each other, shit breaks
[0:37:58] <pennykettle_> pick the dialogue that you all feel in your hearts
[0:38:01] <heemwizard> @andre11dr make him fail the white checks first, then have him succeed second time round

[0:38:37] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> Reject technology, embrace egg
[0:38:39] <MinersLoveGames> same with streamlabs obs
[0:38:41] <Fuji808> OBS is superior in every way and it's FREE.
[0:38:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> could be literally anything from a solar flare flipping a bit to something just being programmed poorly
[0:38:46] <mariothemaio> @spaceitaly ACAB - All Computers Are Bastards
[0:38:46] <%OblivionSword1> reject computer return to abakus

[0:40:09] <spaceitaly> 1000 screaming shitheads swirling in your mind - suffer us, woolie
[0:40:09] <tattleworm> @WoolieVersus gave us a vote to temporarily boost one attribute and lower one attribute
[0:40:10] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> Twitch integration wont work for mobile users.. before you all spam numbers in chat

[0:40:37] <derap41> And we can read you quest log
[0:40:39] <elshadow7> Let's see if we can offset them X-COM rolls
[0:40:43] <Lancaster_H> +1 -1 to a stat when you ask for 30 seconds and the percentages @WoolieVersus
[0:40:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @WoolieVersus We raise one stat and lower another

[0:40:53] <%servicesuspension> I can see the base stats but no the specifics, can anyone see them?
[0:40:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> Before a check stop and ask for our Mercy @WoolieVersus
[0:40:55] <aiutare47> AND penalty, one must go up and one MUST go down, its just moving a point around
[0:40:55] <+YaBish311> Wait more disco today?

[0:42:17] <%illusiveSaint> no, mobile can only see it not participate
[0:42:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> It'd be cool if they'd also let us see the character screen | internalized thoughts.
[0:42:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Composure
[0:42:23] <%kyh9> Reaction Speed was my main skill

[0:44:33] <crocboyz> listen i just want to sceam drugs
[0:44:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> WE ARE THE VOICE OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY
[0:44:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> Drugs and Alcohol are not the same
[0:44:39] <andre11dr> LSD is fine actually
[0:44:42] <%illusiveSaint> straightedge run
[0:44:42] <%X2Eliah> idk Woolie are you staying sober?
[0:44:42] <derap41> Drugs are cool man
[0:44:43] <dds333a> Straight edge run is completely viable
[0:44:43] <%thetunnelhomer> LSD is fine.
[0:44:44] <%Juriasu> BOTH
[0:44:46] <ronin19xx> No drugs
[0:44:46] <%AbnormalVoid> yes
[0:44:47] <Johannen> We are testing your Will Woolie)
[0:44:48] <Louie_Salmon> I mean it ways what they do
[0:44:48] <%thetunnelhomer> Just dont' drink
[0:44:49] <%emperordread> They are hour long mario mushrooms
[0:44:49] <tattleworm> literally both
[0:44:50] <%DiscoMatador> Both
[0:44:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> DRUGS AND Alchol are not the same
[0:44:50] <+Mendin> Yes
[0:44:50] <Miklosher> both really
[0:44:50] <stormhawk9891> BOTH
[0:44:51] <pennykettle_> The people shouting drugs are just murderhobo druggy electrochemistry
[0:44:51] <heemwizard> only alcohol is bad
[0:44:53] <elshadow7> @WoolieVersus do your thing man, it's cool either way
[0:44:54] <seniormeatbox> Both
[0:44:55] <+DraculersRevenge> ResidentSleeper
[0:44:56] <%nicversus> Drugs are bad mkay
[0:44:56] <mariothemaio> Take Drugs, Be Cool LUL
[0:44:57] <heemwizard> like narrative wise
[0:44:57] <ingman112> Both
[0:44:57] <%the_Punktuation> stay sober. the narrative matters
[0:44:57] <+Vivaciousx3> you can seperate drugs from the drink
[0:44:58] <+eanscrale> They give permanent buffs if you level with them on
[0:44:58] <KaseKaizer> yes
[0:44:58] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus In narrative, drugs are bad
[0:45:00] <ingman112> Don’t do it
[0:45:00] <AvroEltz> BUT IT FEELS GOOD WOOLIE
[0:45:01] <StarlitStunner> never drink again
[0:45:01] <+Undenizen> why not do a safety save to see what happens?
[0:45:02] <%servicesuspension> Both really, drugs are bad but also useful
[0:45:02] <Kindredplague> But you get a fancy hat
[0:45:03] <%thetunnelhomer> SPEED and AL GUL are bad
[0:45:06] <iacus_> sounds reasonable
[0:45:08] <Lancaster_H> you can pause the white mourning thought for free btw @WoolieVersus
[0:45:08] <Vorga1339> see us as the role of pushers
[0:45:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> DRUGS AND ALCOHOL ARE NOT TEH SAME
[0:45:09] <dds333a> I thought the same way my first playthrough
[0:45:10] <primaryfire> like pat said on the podcast, being clean is rewarded in the story
[0:45:13] <Vorga1339> be strong
[0:45:14] <andre11dr> I don't know id no drugs does anything but i assume it does
[0:45:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> LSD might not be fine for a man as messed up as our guy here
[0:45:14] <%Vigonept> NO DRUGS
[0:45:15] <sushahana> sounds like a narc man
[0:45:15] <derap41> Drugs Drugs Drugs Which are Good Which are bad
[0:45:16] <LlewynMarie> Woolie, so kind to Harry
[0:45:16] <pennykettle_> You're totally right woolie
[0:45:18] <Elf_Planator> chaT IS ELECTROCHEMISTRY
[0:45:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's fine ignore them woolie
[0:45:21] <%dalmek> BE STRONG
[0:45:21] <ingman112> Taking drugs results in a different character. Same as drinking. It matters
[0:45:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember when I said that Chat is Electrochemistry?
[0:45:25] <iacus_> alcohol is a particular case of drugs
[0:45:25] <elshadow7> Smokes are devastatingly cool though...
[0:45:26] <%OblivionSword1> Alcohol is bad but apparently the RCM is SUPER OKAY with drugs
[0:45:27] <Elf_Planator> sry bout caps
[0:45:28] <DoctorAvens> chat is electrochem
[0:45:29] <derap41> Ask you mom or ask your dad
[0:45:29] <Kindredplague> Dont throw away the baggie
[0:45:30] <%illusiveSaint> stay sober for the rp!
[0:45:32] <%servicesuspension> It's ok to straigh edge it
[0:45:32] <%alexisofthestars> Follow your instincts Woolz
[0:45:34] <pennykettle_> Taking drugs DOES change story
[0:45:34] <%Pookiedaexzile> DRUGs, are not ALCOHOL
[0:45:35] <+Mendin> Chat is filling in the role of the Hideous Tie
[0:45:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[0:45:38] <derap41> Roy seems fine
[0:45:39] <andre11dr> You can not do then
[0:45:39] <primaryfire> people wanting you to use drugs are just agents of chaos
[0:45:41] <ali_dragonight> fuck drugs
[0:45:41] <mariothemaio> Accept Electrochemistry, Reject Volition
[0:45:42] <Johannen> @primaryfire We have already seen the result, Annete said we looked a little better
[0:45:44] <ronin19xx> Dont do it
[0:45:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> Drugs are not Alchol
[0:45:47] <MinersLoveGames> Don't fall off the wagon. I respect that.
[0:45:49] <+eanscrale> Nan man, drugs are good. Haven't you been listening to your electrochem, i's like your conscious or something.
[0:45:50] <%JustYudha> Makes sense
[0:45:51] <Louie_Salmon> But they're so powerful! Don't you want more power?
[0:45:51] <ingman112> It is worth not taking drugs for narrative if that’s the version of the character you want to play.
[0:45:52] <Lancaster_H> doing drugs WILL alter the story
[0:45:53] <+redyoshi5> do what you think is right its your playthrough
[0:45:56] <Johannen> We will tempt you with BIG DRUGS
[0:45:58] <derap41> Kims smokes resposibly
[0:46:03] <heemwizard> just avoid alcohol
[0:46:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> We are electrochemistry.
[0:46:04] <+TheotherKristian> Don't worry Woolie, He is your cop, do drugs at your own pace
[0:46:06] <Deasmeister> You do you woolie chat is just electrochem
[0:46:09] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> just play the game the way you want to, dont have to justify it
[0:46:10] <derap41> Kim smokes
[0:46:13] <%emperordread> You only get high to solve crimes though, it's good drugs
[0:46:13] <andre11dr> Also your not listening to Electro Chemistry anyway so might as well stay clean
[0:46:13] <iacus_> Yeah I'm cool with a no-drugs playthrough
[0:46:14] <heemwizard> but its your choice
[0:46:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> drugs will buff, but WILL change the story
[0:46:15] <%thetunnelhomer> The ULTIMATE PEER PREASSURE
[0:46:16] <%Juriasu> no I was also sober
[0:46:16] <primaryfire> pat didn't and neither did I
[0:46:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> I absolutely did NOT DO drugs in my play thru
[0:46:19] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus It depends how you want your Harry to be. Going clean is a path, going drugs is also a path.
[0:46:22] <pennykettle_> I'm a sober boy
[0:46:22] <%nicversus> I didn't do drugs on my playthrough either
[0:46:22] <dds333a> I didn't at least
[0:46:23] <heemwizard> with twitch boosts its fine
[0:46:24] <+invida> Nope, never did them
[0:46:25] <+abrupt_abe> Only smoked a single cigarette in my run
[0:46:26] <derap41> Reggie is down you hear it here
[0:46:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> Drugs are not Alcohol, Harry has a problem with one and not the other, stop lumping them in
[0:46:27] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, I did ALL THE DRUGS
[0:46:28] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> its as if youre playing a role, in this game
[0:46:28] <+eanscrale> No I was sober, I just want to see someone else do it
[0:46:28] <Johannen> I did my first playthrough as boring sober cop
[0:46:28] <Miklosher> @WoolieVersus nobody did drugs in their playthrough so that's why people want to see it here, lol
[0:46:29] <%illusiveSaint> chat is basically electrochemistry
[0:46:32] <iacus_> I did a no-drug run my first time through the game lol
[0:46:33] <+metzselaar> We did multiple runs, one or more with drugs
[0:46:34] <%OblivionSword1> I did a no drug and no alcohol playthrough the first time
[0:46:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Pookiedaexzile Yeah so about that...

[0:48:46] <heemwizard> always wonder if you succeed that
[0:48:49] <%servicesuspension> You could boost motorics

[1:02:45] <Indigo_Automaton> I'd rather take the bullets
[1:02:50] <%servicesuspension> Somehow, the fancy name makes it worse
[1:02:50] <heemwizard> why not just hanging
[1:02:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:02:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I remember that
[1:02:54] <heemwizard> cheaper
[1:02:55] <andre11dr> Also Baki
[1:02:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fuck me the green mile got me with that
[1:03:01] <%krispen_wa> also Angelo from Jojo
[1:03:02] <%servicesuspension> Hanging is the more humane method, believe it or not
[1:03:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:03:05] <elshadow7> Chair is horror movie shit
[1:03:15] <%heysamuel> oh god
[1:03:19] <%Juriasu> hahaha LUL
[1:03:20] <mariothemaio> chair takes longer, a bullet to the head is immediate at least

[1:03:31] <andre11dr> LUL
[1:03:35] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[1:03:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> I miss the main guy :C
[1:03:41] <%servicesuspension> Bullet, hanging and guillotine are better than more "modern" ones
[1:03:42] <%illusiveSaint> green mile is not a movie i should've watched as a kid
[1:03:43] <%servicesuspension> But everything sucks
[1:03:44] <+Bitscreed> "I'm rightly tired of the pain I hear and feel, Mr Bond."
[1:03:44] <+Undenizen> wait, you went to a movie theater that still uses *reels*?
[1:03:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @servicesuspension only if your neck snaps from the drop if not its slow and agonising
[1:03:47] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> injection can still fuck up
[1:03:52] <%X2Eliah> Injection is super messed up
[1:03:57] <LegitBarnacleBoy> or how bout just not have the state kill people
[1:03:59] <%X2Eliah> Paralysis of movement, no painkillers
[1:04:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Horrorfest That shit
[1:04:00] <mariothemaio> injection is really bad according to research
[1:04:02] <MinersLoveGames> The very first electric chair test apparently didn't work. At all.
[1:04:04] <derap41> If I had to go .50 BMG to the head pls
[1:04:04] <%servicesuspension> @BallerSwagBro9k what an image
[1:04:05] <primaryfire> there are countless botched lethal injections
[1:04:05] <heemwizard> all these complex methods
[1:04:11] <heemwizard> just hang the guy
[1:04:11] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @legitbarnacleboy that would make too much sense
[1:04:16] <%SirGO0SE> lets just not kill people? k :)
[1:04:17] <+Diredoe> Guillotine is actually super humane compared to most methods
[1:04:18] <Lancaster_H> there is a %1 chance you can stand back up and yell something with the firing squad tho
[1:04:24] <andre11dr> Why don't they just use the guillotine anymore?
[1:04:29] <%wibbwobbler> A more humane execution
[1:04:33] <+Undenizen> The most humane, sure-fire execution method would be sudden head crushing. but no one wants to explore that option because.... yeah.
[1:04:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> 'Humane' 'execution' are oxymorons.
[1:04:52] <MinersLoveGames> Because seeing someone get decapitated is a bit... traumatizing for those who haven't seen it before.
[1:04:54] <derap41> Thanks Encyclopedia

[1:05:56] <derap41> "Hardie Boys" Who could possible be the Leader of this group
[1:06:04] <mariothemaio> i like lizzie, she doesn't take shit from cops :)
[1:06:09] <%kewlmyc> Fuck off, Lizzie
[1:06:09] <+Undenizen> @CommanderSqueaks "humane" is a scale of measurement you can apply to any action. no execution is humane, but some are more humane than others
[1:06:12] <gunsrlove> If these cops had a gun with more than one bullet then maybe yes, actually, they could Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:06:14] <+Reverend_Roscoe> no
[1:06:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> She's a lawyer, of course you don't like her, as a cop.

[1:28:04] <pennykettle_> SIMP
[1:28:05] <ingman112> @woolieversus Something to consider w/ twitch integration is that chat responses might tend toward certain lines of dialogue, based on knowledge of the future. So for big important decisions it might be good to leave it off
[1:28:05] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> And kim was ice cold through it all

[1:28:35] <a_bald_bro> she went to law school, she's a waitress not a model
[1:28:37] <%kyh9> tfw people think Glen is a Simp
[1:28:38] <%alexisofthestars> Here we go
[1:28:44] <%heysamuel> chat lacks critical information
[1:28:52] <+Vivaciousx3> still have more in 2 as well?
[1:29:18] <%servicesuspension> you can't present surprise evidence, if evidence is surprise, it's not evidence
[1:29:24] <+Undenizen> thanks legal eagle
[1:29:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> *THE AUTOPSY REPORT HAS BEEN UPDATED.*
[1:29:29] <+Hayajin_> phoenix wright style

[1:29:34] <andre11dr> That is so bizarre
[1:29:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> Surprise evidence is BAD, Reggie
[1:29:38] <%servicesuspension> Phoenix Wright grabbing shit from the crime scene
[1:29:41] <+shapeforn> Has to come out in Discovery, dunno if Disco has that here tho lol
[1:29:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Man law is boring
[1:29:50] <vavilonica> "What do you mean the AUTOPSY IS OUTDATED"
[1:29:58] <derap41> That's why its usually witnesses that do the big twist
[1:30:01] <%wibbwobbler> Right to not incriminate yourself I guess
[1:30:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> How would you like it if the "Surprise" star witness  to your murder trail was a ex who beat you
[1:30:09] <LegitBarnacleBoy> surprise evidence is terrible - no way to know if it's real or permissible or anything, but it can still affect the jury
[1:30:11] <$TheFabledAble> its so that corrupt lawyers cant pull out a "surprise" witness without the defence being able to sus out the witnesses integrity
[1:30:12] <marcdyllan> Innocent UNTIL proven guilty
[1:30:20] <%servicesuspension> Perry Mason did more talk than CSI for a reason

[1:31:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> This is the dad who found the body

[2:00:34] <robert_orri> just do it tomorrow
[2:00:39] <%nicversus> You can talk to them again in the morning
[2:00:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @OblivionSword1 This
[2:00:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's as if you left the building and came back in
[2:00:43] <%hax_metatron> You get it
[2:00:44] <%nicversus> there's more stuff you can do
[2:00:44] <%purps26> That's really weird
[2:00:45] <+glgzephyr> yeah that suckls
[2:00:46] <%hax_metatron> You don't LOSE the content
[2:00:50] <iacus_> doesn't really save the world state, lust reloads the level
[2:00:50] <%X2Eliah> yeah thats not great
[2:00:52] <%DiscoMatador> you can finish the convo tomorrow but it is weird
[2:00:52] <heemwizard> never seen that b4
[2:00:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> You literally lose nothing from keeping this conversation going in Day 3.
[2:00:53] <iacus_> I would call it a bug
[2:00:54] <Futurecity10> @woolieversus you’re fine just continue the conversation tomorrow
[2:00:56] <%purps26> That feels like a bug
[2:00:56] <pennykettle_> its not like you lost anything but yeah thats dumb
[2:01:00] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s not a big deal
[2:01:00] <Indigo_Automaton> You didn't lose progress
[2:01:05] <AlbertoRobert> @illusiveSaint if you enter the whirling before 11pm, then they will stay as long as you don't reload or leave the area
[2:01:05] <%OblivionSword1> You don't lose content Woolie
[2:01:05] <tranquilturnip> That is almost a surredly a bug
[2:01:06] <+zepelinnn1> you lost NOTHING
[2:01:07] <Crippl3> @WoolieVersus you didn't miss out on anything, you can come back tomorrow
[2:01:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nothing is lost
[2:01:07] <%hax_metatron> You don't lose anything
[2:01:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> It fucked up nothing
[2:01:09] <robert_orri> you didn't lose out on anything
[2:01:09] <%kewlmyc> Wait, what happened?
[2:01:09] <Lancaster_H> you lost literally nothing, you can do the same thing tomorrow morning
[2:01:10] <%nicversus> There's more stuff you can do woolz
[2:01:11] <%alexisofthestars> It´s because of the in game hours
[2:01:12] <Fuji808> You didn't lose anything.
[2:01:13] <%Juriasu> you'll just have to do it later
[2:01:13] <+Ritei> its not fucked up though
[2:01:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> That's only because you did it so late
[2:01:14] <%harmadill0> the save system is imperfect, I'd consider it a bug
[2:01:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie you literally are losing nothing
[2:01:14] <+glgzephyr> Nothing was lost, Woolie
[2:01:15] <gunsrlove> Fuck chat, play correctly, disregard cringe
[2:01:15] <linSP> It was just bad timing
[2:01:18] <heemwizard> eh you could had chose 4 which should let u go back
[2:01:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You have to hard save
[2:01:19] <dukenux> you dont lose anything
[2:01:19] <%heysamuel> yeah you lost nothing, it was just bad timing
[2:01:19] <+redyoshi5> you didn't lose content
[2:01:19] <tattleworm> reloading loaded the area, so the dudes left
[2:01:20] <%harmadill0> not a big deal though, doesn't affect you materially
[2:01:20] <die_hardman> Yea, ZA/UM could do a little better
[2:01:20] <+justianxix> didnt lose progress or the options
[2:01:20] <meatman_noplan> They'll be there first thing in the morning again.
[2:01:20] <%doomerskeletor13> You haven’t lost anything, they’re still there tomorrow
[2:01:24] <%heysamuel> yes
[2:01:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[2:01:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[2:01:26] <+Bitscreed> It's only because it was so late at night in-game.
[2:01:27] <Indigo_Automaton> Yes
[2:01:27] <%TheTimelordPan> it's not a bug, it's a feature
[2:01:28] <Frostilk> yes
[2:01:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> After 11, NPCs leave. Possibly, the game doesn't despawn them while you're in the area. The reload reset the area after 11, thus, no NPCs
[2:01:29] <%alexisofthestars> Yes
[2:01:30] <die_hardman> @woolieversus u didn’t lose progress
[2:01:30] <%X2Eliah> yes
[2:01:31] <+abrupt_abe> 100%
[2:01:31] <mariothemaio> yes
[2:01:36] <+Ritei> overthinking
[2:01:38] <+charp35> That suck sorry about that
[2:01:40] <andre11dr> I voted for 4 btw
[2:01:45] <%OblivionSword1> Woolie you don't lose content you can still resume the conversation
[2:01:45] <robert_orri> true
[2:01:45] <laserbeaming> it's weird, but it's intended
[2:01:48] <Johannen> Just a wierd interaction of the in game timer
[2:01:49] <%Irridium> I voted for 4
[2:01:49] <andre11dr> Should've picked 4
[2:01:50] <%purps26> That feels like a bug
[2:01:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair
[2:01:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CappuccinoGuil Gotta admit, that isn't really the best. I agree with Woolie
[2:01:52] <heemwizard> @andre11dr ayy me too
[2:01:55] <%servicesuspension> people only despawn when you are not looking at them
[2:01:56] <derap41> 3rd save should work then'
[2:01:58] <heemwizard> too bad
[2:01:59] <$TheFabledAble> do autosave
[2:01:59] <AvroEltz> Then you lost, should not have started talking to them at 22:00
[2:02:00] <IzanagiNoOokami> Don't kill yourself after 11 PM.  That's hilarious.
[2:02:01] <dukenux> but the hour says 22-49
[2:02:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> You can talk to sexy lady.
[2:02:03] <+Bitscreed> You can stick Kim's gun in your mouth again first thing tomorrow morning.
[2:02:04] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s not a bug, that’s just how the game works
[2:02:05] <tranquilturnip> I did that same option and I got no weirdness on my playthrough
[2:02:06] <+mechslayer71> But content right
[2:02:07] <linSP> Not a bug, but not very QOL
[2:02:07] <pennykettle_> they show up tomorrow so you didnt lose anything. Although in the future you *Could* depending on the encounter
[2:02:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you'll see
[2:02:15] <%TheTimelordPan> morning gun suck time
[2:02:15] <%servicesuspension> next morning, it's the same
[2:02:15] <lksrkson> this is just very specific
[2:02:18] <%alexisofthestars> You resume conversation 2
[2:02:26] <+Ritei> nothing was lost
[2:02:27] <%alexisofthestars> tomorrow
[2:02:27] <%CappuccinoGuil> @OblivionSword1 The problem isn't this moment, the problem is this creates a precedent that will scare them off from Content.
[2:02:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> true
[2:02:31] <%nicversus> @WoolieVersus the same thing would have happened if you stepped outside and walked back in so don't worry about it-- there's lots to talk about with the hardie boys yet
[2:02:31] <thehijinx88> "Worst game ever, 0/10"- Woolie probably
[2:02:31] <%purps26> You're right, that sucks. You ran into a really weird specific case
[2:02:36] <MrPedrovsky> 11PM suicide challenge (Gone Wrong)
[2:02:37] <Indigo_Automaton> Go get those boots
[2:02:41] <heemwizard> youre not supposed to save in conversations
[2:02:41] <%illusiveSaint> how did the save and the convo start in the first place? makes no sense
[2:02:41] <derap41> Such highs Such lows
[2:02:42] <+mechslayer71> Do stuff until 2 am
[2:02:47] <die_hardman> TAKE A BATH WOOLIE
[2:02:49] <%LCLSmoothie> get the boots
[2:02:52] <%servicesuspension> They only stayed because you kept them here
[2:02:52] <%thetunnelhomer> Exactly one low
[2:02:53] <%harmadill0> It's a bug, but you got lucky and it didn't matter, don't be scared off content
[2:02:53] <Vorga1339> Woolie that's the failstate conversation for the Auth check
[2:02:53] <%nintega010> yeah
[2:02:55] <pennykettle_> There's 1 NPC that vanishes from the game forever as soon as you walk away from them, not even a reload of the area
[2:02:57] <Timarkot> Don't do important stuff late at night
[2:03:03] <%Juriasu> @WoolieVersus you could reload first save today if you really wanted to do it the same way again
[2:03:03] <Johannen> @illusiveSaint Because the state of the room cannot change when you are present in it
[2:03:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @CappuccinoGuil Agreed, it's not great. I think it's not intentional, though, just a side-effect of how they despawn characters after 11.
[2:03:09] <Vorga1339> you can still get the success conversation
[2:03:09] <%nicversus> @MrPedrovsky Gone Sexual ;)
[2:03:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Chat it’s not a bug, that’s literally just how the game works
[2:03:23] <Lancaster_H> he's not wrong but starting the convo at 22:49 is also not very expected
[2:03:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @illusiveSaint they started talking before 11, and they don't despawn after 11 if the area isn't' reloaded. reloading the save is like if they left the building and came back in, in both scenarios they would be gone
[2:03:25] <+MightyDuckShoes> He lost time. Theres a ticking clock in this game
[2:03:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @doomerskeletor13 Fair, but it's a poor design choice.
[2:03:26] <%doomerskeletor13> After a certain point all NPC’s go to bed
[2:03:26] <Indigo_Automaton> Shower after boots
[2:03:27] <+Mendin> stinky boy
[2:03:28] <%harmadill0> No it's a bug, it's not good design for saving and loading to not perfectly reproduce what was going on
[2:03:30] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh
[2:03:31] <MrPedrovsky> @nicversus Mysteriously sexual
[2:03:31] <die_hardman> @doomerskeletor13 not good QOL, but it’s what it is
[2:03:32] <%servicesuspension> ZA/UM is inexperienced, probably didn't catch this
[2:03:33] <%harmadill0> it's by design,  but stilla  bug
[2:03:39] <derap41> @doomerskeletor13 yeah but lets be real it shouldn't work like that
[2:03:40] <heemwizard> the game doesnt load you in conversations
[2:03:45] <iacus_> I'm comfortable calling it a bug, since game saves should save the full state
[2:03:49] <cutemuteprude> That's literally never
[2:03:52] <meatman_noplan> Its def a bug
[2:03:55] <heemwizard> it also shouldnt save during convos
[2:03:56] <@Solidus_113> it's jank, but that's real timers in video games
[2:03:58] <%OblivionSword1> The game will tell you if important things will happen next
[2:03:58] <%harmadill0> If they stay after 11 when you saved, they should be there when you load
[2:04:00] <+Ritei> incredibly specific and rare interaction thats going to scare him off content for the rest of the game ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[2:04:02] <laserbeaming> @CappuccinoGuil It's a compromise, saving the status of NPCs is probably not worth it, might even add more bugs
[2:04:02] <%thetunnelhomer> It's a good reason to go to bed at a reasonable time.
[2:04:03] <pennykettle_> The game does have its bugs
[2:04:07] <thehijinx88> You still didn't really loose anything
[2:04:08] <snuffkins> It's a rare scenario, and only tends to happen at late night
[2:04:13] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s very few things you can actually miss
[2:04:13] <marcheries> it's perfectly reasonable though
[2:04:16] <%nicversus> @MrPedrovsky only if you can pass the inland empire check
[2:04:27] <iacus_> I get why they did it. I still wich they didn't
[2:04:28] <primaryfire> this seems like unintentional behaviour
[2:04:29] <balthazar758> so the save happened in the middle of the conversation?
[2:04:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair enough
[2:04:30] <%servicesuspension> it's very situational, don't worry
[2:04:34] <dukenux> fair
[2:04:36] <$lumporr> couldn't woolie just load the save right before 11pm and go through the convos?
[2:04:41] <%OblivionSword1> no
[2:04:42] <%illusiveSaint> does the dialogue gets saved or do they have to restart that too
[2:04:42] <%heysamuel> no debriefing anymore, sadly
[2:04:42] <Indigo_Automaton> Debriefing was just nnight 1
[2:04:42] <SomeAsianDood> no
[2:04:43] <heemwizard> again not supposed to save and load during convos
[2:04:46] <%emperordread> Woolie failed the authority check Vs the game
[2:04:46] <die_hardman> @lumporr wasted time
[2:04:46] <%nicversus> no just go to your bedroom door
[2:04:47] <derap41> No sleeping Rob Cunos Dad
[2:04:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lumporr eh that's pretty far back
[2:04:53] <iacus_> You've already been debriefed and spend the whole day with Kim
[2:04:53] <Lancaster_H> @lumporr he could, but it would take long
[2:04:54] <Blank9> it only happens with stopping a conversation and saving in the middle after 11
[2:04:56] <pennykettle_> They could reload an old save but its not worth at all
[2:04:56] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus This only can happen in the transition from before 23:00 to after 23:00, so most of the time you are safe anyway
[2:04:57] <laserbeaming> debriefing is only once
[2:04:58] <+Reverend_Roscoe> ask about the pissong contest
[2:05:03] <derap41> Pyro come on
[2:05:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Let us boost
[2:05:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @laserbeaming agreed, it's very minor and very specific. I don't think it'll have any impact overall with how the game is structured, but it's hard to tell now
[2:05:09] <Johannen> Pissing competition
[2:05:12] <guiltyboya> TRY IT ANYWAY
[2:05:20] <%illusiveSaint> wear the die

[2:09:30] <+glgzephyr> yeah the game doesn't preserve door open states when you leave the area
[2:09:31] <tattleworm> what if somebody comes in and trashes the room... again?

[2:25:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> "It's what we got"
[2:25:42] <heemwizard> @Gawayne2 what games are you referencing?
[2:25:42] <%doomerskeletor13> The Coalition is like “sure you guys do your thing”
[2:25:43] <%servicesuspension> it's either that or the union, and the ultraliberals don't like the union
[2:25:53] <derap41> Also What Tidus is
[2:25:56] <%emperordread> "De Jew-ray"? I thought it was "Do jooor"
[2:25:57] <iacus_> you're volunteers
[2:26:03] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s why the Hardies don’t recognize your right to police them
[2:26:05] <%servicesuspension> yeah, this is something many critics don't understand about this game
[2:26:08] <iacus_> you're not really part of the State
[2:26:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Tidus is/was ALSO the defacto authority here.
[2:26:09] <heemwizard> @derap41 he isnt the law, HARRY is the LAW
[2:26:12] <Johannen> You are explicitly not a cop
[2:26:15] <+Diredoe> @emperordread Yeah, that's how I learned to pronounce it
[2:26:17] <%servicesuspension> you are a militsia, not a police force
[2:26:20] <dukenux> more down to earth Specters from ME?
[2:26:21] <LegitBarnacleBoy> that's why the hardie boys are like "ARREST ME BITCH SEE WHAT HAPPENS"
[2:26:22] <+glgzephyr> there are no cops

[2:29:38] <AngryAsian5> They tried to DIY a nuclear reactor
[2:29:42] <+Bitscreed> The People's Pile!
[2:29:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Building a NUCLEAR REACTOR is NOT a COMMUNITY PROJECT.
[2:29:43] <aiutare47> a bunch of randoms built a homemade nuclear reactor in the streets
[2:29:45] <%doomerskeletor13> it was POST revolution Woolie
[2:29:48] <$TheFabledAble> the meltdown occured after the rule of red ended
[2:29:49] <dauver> meltdown was NOT during the commune
[2:29:50] <%servicesuspension> yeah, the communists fucked that one up. no ifs or buts about that one
[2:29:50] <%OblivionSword1> Chernobyl is right around the block
[2:29:53] <Deasmeister> Post revolution
[2:29:54] <gamewarden92> How to Basic: Nuclear Reactor
[2:29:58] <derap41> Listen the Communist where having a grand old time then these Moralist started bombarding us
[2:29:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> The meltdown is sad most of all. Good intention, road, etc.
[2:30:01] <WeepyDevil> that wasn't the reds
[2:30:01] <%thetunnelhomer> The Meltdown was a Coalition thing though
[2:30:04] <+glgzephyr> @servicesuspension it wasn't the communists bro
[2:30:04] <Crippl3> meltdown was not during the communists
[2:30:05] <+RealThiele> just inject the nuclear, ez
[2:30:06] <SomeAsianDood> commune came up with the idea. people continued it
[2:30:06] <heemwizard> @doomerskeletor13 they started during the revolution but it meltdown after
[2:30:11] <laserbeaming> it started on the revolution and it continued after
[2:30:16] <%nicversus> The pile was not during the commune
[2:30:18] <%doomerskeletor13> It was a bunch of poor people trying to survive after the Coalition invaded, it was not the Communards
[2:30:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they hate us cuz they aint us
[2:30:27] <%servicesuspension> @glgzephyr wait was the coalition then? I thought it was a communard initiative
[2:30:28] <+RealThiele> Lawr
[2:30:44] <+eanscrale> Trying to pin the failures of the moralists of the corpses of the revolution is inline with an agent of capital interests
[2:30:44] <seniormeatbox> @servicesuspension centrism
[2:30:47] <derap41> Wanna FucK?
[2:30:48] <Crippl3> @servicesuspension coalition is the current governement
[2:30:50] <heemwizard> @servicesuspension no, a coalition of foreign governments ruling revochol
[2:30:54] <+Undenizen> Yo Joice is alright.
[2:31:02] <+glgzephyr> @servicesuspension No, it was a bunch of random civvies that got together and decided to build their own reactor. It went as well as you can expect
[2:31:12] <%servicesuspension> Ohh, I was confused about that one
[2:31:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Undenizen nuh uh she's rich so she's evil Kappa

[2:31:44] <mariothemaio> or forgetting internalized thoughts
[2:31:56] <%doomerskeletor13> It was post Revolution
[2:32:04] <derap41> Wasn't Officially communist
[2:32:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> No, it was post revolution
[2:32:05] <%Vigonept> it was after the revolution
[2:32:08] <Johannen> After the failure of revolution

[2:32:13] <laserbeaming> it started during, continued after
[2:32:15] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus started building before moralists, melt down after the moralist takeover
[2:32:20] <%doomerskeletor13> It was during the Coalition occupation
[2:32:22] <Deasmeister> No meltdown was after
[2:32:22] <dauver> They started building during the commune, meltdown was after the coalition landing
[2:32:23] <ingman112> The meltdown was after the moralists
[2:32:24] <SomeAsianDood> started during continued after
[2:32:25] <heemwizard> the meltdown HAPPENED AFTER the revolution, the construction of the nuclear plant started during the revolution
[2:32:28] <LegitBarnacleBoy> @WoolieVersus the moralists let the city be shitty for a while - the citizens tried to make a reactor because the moralists weren't helping them out
[2:32:29] <%nicversus> @Prevot it was snuffed out in its infancy
[2:32:32] <+glgzephyr> You can kill Cuno's father
[2:32:32] <snuffkins> The meltdown happened after the commune fell.
[2:32:36] <mariothemaio> communist overthrow monarchy -> moralists overthrow communist -> communist keep working on reactor and it goes bust
[2:32:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> NO
[2:32:45] <marcheries> no
[2:32:45] <%doomerskeletor13> It was poor people trying to survive because the Moralists didn’t give a fuck about them
[2:32:46] <ingman112> The nuclear meltdown was during coalition occupation, after the revolution
[2:32:47] <LegitBarnacleBoy> no
[2:32:49] <stormhawk9891> Cuno's dad can be done with Kim in tow so wait till tomorrow

[2:33:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Poor people
[2:33:07] <%Vigonept> the citizens being shit on by the moralist
[2:33:07] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus so basically the moralist intern ignored the fact that peasants were working on a reactor, and gave ZERO assistance, because they would benefit from the fallout
[2:33:08] <robert_orri> woolie being a reactionary
[2:33:08] <AngryAsian5> The people living there
[2:33:09] <%DiscoMatador> The people who lived nearby
[2:33:09] <heemwizard> as if commies can build a nuclear reactor lol
[2:33:10] <AlbertoRobert> Just regular poor people
[2:33:11] <%servicesuspension> Regular citizens
[2:33:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> POOR FOLKS
[2:33:12] <+physicslawyer> Poor.
[2:33:12] <cutemuteprude> THE CITIZENS
[2:33:13] <+Afrobrawler> Random people banded together
[2:33:13] <derap41> Is Hirosima Einstein's fault?
[2:33:15] <%LCLSmoothie> poor people
[2:33:18] <neostria> WE ARE THE PEOPLE
[2:33:19] <primaryfire> I'm uncomfortable with your scapegoating of mazovian socioeconomics sire
[2:33:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> It was a community group project.
[2:33:21] <+1upclock> Moralist Woolie, smh
[2:33:23] <Zomner> Random citizens
[2:33:25] <laserbeaming> volunteer, idealist, regular people
[2:33:25] <brisk_dacat> factory workers
[2:33:33] <+Prevot> @derap41 tbh, kinda
[2:33:33] <+meniscate> cryptomoralist
[2:33:34] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie outing himself as a Moralist
[2:33:35] <%AbnormalVoid> time to cook
[2:33:36] <derap41> Reggie got it down
[2:33:37] <WeepyDevil> @heemwizard what was the cold war again
[2:33:37] <+eanscrale> Lick Joyce's boot dirt more why don't you.
[2:33:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> Moralists killed all communists. So no communists who COULD work on the pile were alive.
[2:33:43] <nelsonsaysbooya> literally every ideology had failed in Revahol. All of them
[2:33:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> The communists were DEAD after the Moralists came in
[2:33:44] <+Reverend_Roscoe> no
[2:33:53] <%krispen_wa> Joyce aint a moralist
[2:33:54] <+glgzephyr> not only were they not in power, they were all DEAD
[2:33:55] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus They needed the power after the war to live in the ruins
[2:33:56] <+1upclock> Finished my first run of this game this week, 10/10
[2:33:56] <%Vigonept> No, it was poor people trying to have electricity
[2:33:58] <Zomner> nah, most communists got killed
[2:33:58] <derap41> It was literally just normal people building a reaktor
[2:33:59] <blue6sub6remnant6> I can't believe all those dead comminards created a dirty bomb reactor from beyond the grave.
[2:34:00] <Strigiform> they shot all the communists
[2:34:03] <+RealThiele> war caused brain drain
[2:34:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> DEAD PEOPLE cannot build a reactor Woolie
[2:34:10] <+Undenizen> Joice is *ULTRA*
[2:34:11] <$TheFabledAble> The moralintern gave ZERO assistance despite having the resources, because the fallout would give them tighter controll over what was left
[2:34:12] <heemwizard> @heemwizard see Chernobyl, never said they couldnt build nukes tho
[2:34:12] <%doomerskeletor13> All the communists were dead by then
[2:34:14] <+glgzephyr> time to do it
[2:34:30] <Rujugybrew> Rujugybrew subscribed with Prime. 
[2:34:35] <hyperbolero> This feels like a health hazard
[2:34:35] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:34:35] <derap41> Time for Soup
[2:34:38] <heemwizard> @doomerskeletor13 no they were not
[2:34:40] <laserbeaming> Part of the bitterness of the Pawnshop is because he can't really blame them for trying, given their circumstances
[2:34:42] <%servicesuspension> Mr Krabs, why did you cook my boots
[2:34:46] <%X2Eliah> Boiling boots is a real thing, people in pre-18th century did it
[2:34:55] <%DiscoMatador> death boots
[2:34:56] <%X2Eliah> Meat is meat
[2:34:57] <heemwizard> you need the cook here for that
[2:35:00] <%PMAvers> Crank. It. UP!
[2:35:01] <%krispen_wa> Put the boots in the stew
[2:35:03] <pepinillomaton> U gonna improve the borchst
[2:35:03] <Johannen> No T in Borsh
[2:35:06] <%doomerskeletor13> *poor people keep working on their own reactor because their occupiers don’t give a fuck about them* “clearly this is communism’s fault”

[2:35:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> 2
[2:35:29] <+Undenizen> so, as a taxidermist, i feel like my expertise on getting dead flesh smell out of stuff is relevant.
[2:35:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Soap!
[2:35:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> Vinegar is a fucking cleaning product, DON'T AT ME
[2:35:47] <%krispen_wa> Vinegar smells worse than corpse gunk
[2:35:47] <%spederdave> delicioso!
[2:35:49] <%X2Eliah> Vinegar is a cleaning product AND spice
[2:35:50] <$TheFabledAble> The moralintern gave ZERO assistance despite having the resources, because the fallout would give them tighter control over what was left. So basically they "did nothing wrong" by "doing nothing at all" and became kings of the ashes
[2:35:50] <ginkjink> eww vinegar smell
[2:35:50] <MinersLoveGames> Oh god, this is going to be horrific.
[2:35:51] <+glgzephyr> DELICIOUS
[2:35:54] <%servicesuspension> @Undenizen it's always relevant, don't undersell yourself man
[2:35:55] <laserbeaming> @Johannen Depends, I think some languages like Ukrainian pronounce it with a t? I'm not sure

[2:36:02] <%nicversus> @CappuccinoGuil an occasionally delicious cleaning product
[2:36:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> FOOT SOUP
[2:36:10] <+Bitscreed> The smell of cheap soap and vinegar is vastly preferable to the smell of rotting human flesh
[2:36:11] <Gawayne2> I just relaized, now that you have the boots, the hanging victim is practically Corpse (Nothing)

[2:38:49] <+glgzephyr> it's not a lot
[2:38:49] <+Bitscreed> Those boots really tie your ensemble together.
[2:38:50] <dukenux> You started as the messed up Dude
[2:38:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> 5 is fine
[2:38:52] <Blank9> 12 is a lot
[2:38:55] <%heysamuel> a lot would be like 8
[2:38:55] <%holydeviant1> 8 is when it starts to even talk
[2:38:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> Keep tie
[2:38:57] <%nicversus> a lot of authority, and next to no composure
[2:39:01] <andre11dr> You are really becoming to look like an Apocalypse Cop

[2:39:13] <+glgzephyr> @krispen_wa Are you surprised?
[2:39:13] <sleepy_pixels> more like a slobby leon
[2:39:21] <Blank9> you need a lot of authority to not call people whores and shoot yourself in the head, apparently
[2:39:21] <heemwizard> @CappuccinoGuil but he failed the check
[2:39:24] <Timarkot> @WoolieVersus Do reading

[2:39:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> NO BRATTAN

[2:40:02] <%krispen_wa> Man, it's sad he'll never get to hear Best Boi Horrible Necktie
[2:40:03] <Indigo_Automaton> @CappuccinoGuil It's reliant on passing an Inland Empire check the first time you interact with the tie
[2:40:05] <laserbeaming> @Pookiedaexzile No Bratan for us, the tie doesn't talk to Woolie. He failed that.
[2:40:07] <heemwizard> @CappuccinoGuil no

[2:40:46] <mariothemaio> LUL
[2:40:48] <cutemuteprude> 97% is most

[2:40:50] <%heysamuel> LUL
[2:40:50] <derap41> 97% is the most possible
[2:40:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> 97% is max
[2:40:52] <mariothemaio> 97 is the highest
[2:40:52] <WakeUpThrow> Biggest brain
[2:40:53] <%OblivionSword1> 92% is the maximum right ?
[2:40:54] <%servicesuspension> 97% is the most, because of snake eyes
[2:40:55] <dukenux> 97 is
[2:40:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lets blow it the fuck up
[2:40:57] <%illusiveSaint> dont reads it yet
[2:40:59] <sushahana> luwered LUL
[2:41:00] <%OblivionSword1> ok 97 is the maximum
[2:41:05] <+metzselaar> double one always fails
[2:41:06] <%nicversus> 97 can only be beat by snake eyes
[2:41:07] <jeflakvastskaft> snake eyes is always a fail
[2:41:08] <primaryfire> 97% is the max because snake eyes is always a failure
[2:41:10] <laserbeaming> Snake Eyes always fails
[2:41:11] <%PMAvers> 100% is impossible, since there's always a chance of rolling snake eyes as a auto-fail.
[2:41:11] <SomeAsianDood> snakes eyes auto fail so always 97%
[2:41:12] <AvroEltz> there will always be snake eyes
[2:41:13] <2guard> oh shit how late am i to the stream
[2:41:13] <Deasmeister> Snake eyes always loses

[2:58:14] <dukenux> im not even a dedicated commie, but screw landlords
[2:58:14] <lksrkson> LUL
[2:58:20] <Crippl3> Yes, that's the reason, nothing else 🙄

[2:58:27] <%OblivionSword1> Embrace the Kingdom of Conscience
[2:58:28] <derap41> Housing is a human right
[2:58:32] <%illusiveSaint> TRUE communists are mask off but insufferable LUL
[2:58:40] <+tabenterenter> why do communist suddenly appear every time you are near?
[2:58:42] <Miklosher> We need more shivers clearly
[2:58:44] <andre11dr> And now, time to finally take a shower
[2:58:45] <ingman112> Btw a central point of political nuance to keep in mind is WHEN the Revolution actually failed. Did its failure prompt the intervention of the Moralintern, or did it fail B/C of their intervention? Commies and social dems say the latter, moralists and many ultraliberals the former. Whereas the few remaining fascists are just angry at everybody who’s not them
[2:58:52] <aiutare47> Communists are fucking dweebs but landlords are worse
[2:58:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> FOOD IS A HUMAN RIGHT
[2:58:53] <Demoliboy2> shivers and edc
[2:58:54] <%nicversus> you can sit on a bench for 15 minutes
[2:58:54] <iacus_> just a shower should give you a few mins
[2:58:54] <balthazar758> the content master
[2:58:55] <derap41> Slots becausue lost are great
[2:58:55] <+glgzephyr> So, how EXACTLY do passive checks work? Do they just add 6 to your current stat level for the passive check?
[2:58:58] <%hax_metatron> Kingdom of Conscience if you want to go Moralist

[2:59:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Bitch
[2:59:11] <%servicesuspension> @glgzephyr yeah, checks use no dice
[2:59:12] <die_hardman> PUT UR BOOTS ON
[2:59:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> COWARDICE
[2:59:14] <heemwizard> the CORRECT choice
[2:59:15] <%AmuserName> Moralistic :)
[2:59:16] <Deasmeister> moralism
[2:59:17] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> super incredibly slow progress
[2:59:17] <iacus_> INTERNALIZE Moralism
[2:59:17] <derap41> Center left
[2:59:18] <andre11dr> HUSTLE is pretty fun
[2:59:21] <Miklosher> im feeling shivery
[2:59:21] <%thetunnelhomer> Need more Hand/eye
[2:59:22] <%illusiveSaint> kingdom is the sober thought
[2:59:24] <heemwizard> the choice that WON
[2:59:24] <+glgzephyr> good to know for certain, thanks.
[2:59:25] <%DiscoMatador> Composure lookin FUCKIN low
[2:59:30] <laserbeaming> one more shivers for extra content?
[2:59:34] <%servicesuspension> finally some normality and common sense
[2:59:35] <cutemuteprude> @illusiveSaint Nah, that's Wasteland
[2:59:38] <%OblivionSword1> MORE SHIVERS
[2:59:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> MORE SHIVERS
[2:59:43] <heemwizard> @laserbeaming add it to volition
[2:59:46] <%Vigonept> even numbers
[2:59:51] <Miklosher> EDC maybe?
[2:59:51] <ingman112> You’ve probably got enough shivers at this point
[2:59:52] <%DiscoMatador> one more shivers for more shivers content
[2:59:54] <%OblivionSword1> Put more into Shivers
[2:59:54] <+glgzephyr> Wasteland of Conscience LUL
[2:59:56] <Indigo_Automaton> Putting both of those in Composure wouldn't be a bad idea
[2:59:56] <ingman112> Volition ain’t bad
[2:59:58] <sushahana> more shivers, MORE
[2:59:58] <Miklosher> Ohh volition
[2:59:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> One more in Shivers
[3:00:00] <%the_Punktuation> CORPS
[3:00:02] <derap41> Volition is fine at 4
[3:00:03] <+Afrobrawler> pump some int stats
[3:00:05] <heemwizard> 1 into volition then 1 into edc or shivers
[3:00:06] <andre11dr> Volition and Endurance is always nice
[3:00:06] <ingman112> Composure too
[3:00:06] <+shapeforn> Volition is dope
[3:00:08] <%the_Punktuation> CORPS STORIES
[3:00:08] <+glgzephyr> That's because you haven't bumped it LUL
[3:00:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> because it's low
[3:00:11] <dukenux> shivers huge
[3:00:15] <dauver> volition is a bro
[3:00:17] <Zomner> Cause it's low
[3:00:18] <derap41> of couse you like volition its boring
[3:00:18] <nelsonsaysbooya> Volition is often damaged
[3:00:19] <mariothemaio> volition is quiet because your stat is low
[3:00:19] <%nicversus> Volition chimes in more if you level it
[3:00:21] <Miklosher> because low volition, pump it
[3:00:22] <hyperbolero> ?? Might those facts be connected...
[3:00:22] <+Bitscreed> Authority would help you, y'know, assert it
[3:00:23] <Demoliboy2> they usually chime in in intervals of 2 levels
[3:00:28] <%servicesuspension> Volition is like that stand whose only function is being a bro
[3:00:28] <+mechslayer71> You’re gonna need it @woolieversus
[3:00:28] <Demoliboy2> so even levels
[3:00:30] <+glgzephyr> Oh you need to boost your perception
[3:00:34] <depressioncherrie> Volition is your only real bro
[3:00:34] <laserbeaming> 8 Shivers will make the Challenging Shivers Passives succeed
[3:00:35] <dukenux> maybe bump composure? just to be safe
[3:00:37] <+glgzephyr> 100% do perception rn
[3:00:39] <%DiscoMatador> one in shivers and one somewhere else?
[3:00:40] <zhukis> Think dnd rules, you want multiples of 2
[3:00:41] <$TheFabledAble> perception 1000%
[3:00:42] <nelsonsaysbooya> Authority is not a bad choice
[3:00:44] <%thetunnelhomer> You can't shoot a gun with shivers
[3:00:45] <elshadow7> I'd say Perception over H/E for now
[3:00:45] <Indigo_Automaton> Perception is a good idea
[3:00:47] <Blank9> if you're passing all passives, you're not getting more passives from pumping it higher
[3:00:50] <crocboyz> perception
[3:00:51] <%illusiveSaint> composure is important,
[3:00:59] <cutemuteprude> H/E is important for some stuff
[3:01:02] <Deasmeister> If you max a stat you can't reunlock checks
[3:01:04] <+glgzephyr> Perception lights up new objects in the environment when you pump it @WoolieVersus
[3:01:04] <%servicesuspension> Interfacing is not very common, but it does some cool shit
[3:01:06] <primaryfire> perception is really useful overall
[3:01:11] <heemwizard> @illusiveSaint you need it for a very important end check
[3:01:12] <Indigo_Automaton> Good
[3:01:13] <Miklosher> hell yes
[3:01:18] <heemwizard> but by that point should be ok
[3:01:30] <andre11dr> Ok Volition over Endurance, that's fine
[3:01:36] <elshadow7> I think you can try the intercom check again?
[3:01:36] <dukenux> nah, Goodfellas was garlic
[3:01:41] <+glgzephyr> it's also just a property of tomatoes LUL
[3:01:44] <+mechslayer71> You’re gonna be happy you did that later @woolieversus

[3:29:12] <%nicversus> @hattrick61 don't tell the homophobes in the 70s and 80s that, they wouldn't be able to take it
[3:29:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh nice motorics cap  raised
[3:29:16] <+glgzephyr> @illusiveSaint Yeah I've never seen the voice proc here
[3:29:25] <a_bald_bro> whoa i was complaining you can't zoom out fat enough and didn't know this was a thing

[3:29:38] <%krispen_wa> not that good honestly
[3:29:43] <%Juriasu> stop associatiing with yourself
[3:29:45] <heemwizard> camera zoom out
[3:29:45] <derap41> Thoughts do more than just affect stats
[3:29:47] <%Vigonept> mouse wheel
[3:29:48] <%servicesuspension> More motorics to run away from the past
[3:29:49] <Timarkot> What a waste
[3:29:49] <+glgzephyr> makes moving around much easier
[3:29:51] <heemwizard> outside mostly

[3:29:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I can't even zoom out on my mouse so it became useless xS
[3:29:57] <+coolthulhuu> kinda bad tbh lol
[3:29:57] <%illusiveSaint> character dissociation
[3:29:59] <Zomner> yup
[3:30:00] <Estwilde> Make the man small. He's not really -you-
[3:30:01] <Johannen> Does game even render that?
[3:30:01] <+meniscate> this thought is really going to mess up a future scene mechanically
[3:30:05] <Project205> It fits the theme PogChamp
[3:30:05] <derap41> Thoughts do other things than what they just say
[3:30:06] <+ClericOfSparda> That's pretty funny.
[3:30:08] <Crippl3> small man, make him small
[3:30:09] <meatman_noplan> Distancing yourself from harry.
[3:30:10] <%hax_metatron> Yeah it totally does
[3:30:11] <+DekeZander> getting further away from yourself
[3:30:12] <%hax_metatron> Go out and test it
[3:30:12] <Indigo_Automaton> The motorics cap increase is worth it alone
[3:30:15] <%hax_metatron> You can see higher zoom
[3:30:16] <+glgzephyr> yep
[3:30:19] <$hattrick61> little man gets smaller -literallay-
[3:30:19] <DSD24> OS chips
[3:30:23] <iacus_> no spoilers plz
[3:30:24] <%servicesuspension> Nier Automata and the UI chips
[3:30:25] <%hax_metatron> It's useful later in the game
[3:30:30] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ohhhh yeah
[3:30:32] <Estwilde> It's such a cool idea
[3:30:35] <%nicversus> oh he read the note! If you throw it away, the thought that you get from it gives you 3 levels
[3:30:37] <ingman112> Good timing for the motorics cap with maxing on perception
[3:30:43] <+glgzephyr> it's similar in concept
[3:30:56] <+Standard_Enemy> Diagetic gameplay mechanics is fucking cool
[3:30:56] <%Javaa01> Sacrifice your Health Bar for more Combo
[3:31:07] <dukenux> you can drop the HUD entirely, no?
[3:31:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @dukenux ye
[3:31:15] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's a cool idea but practically kind of useless, for a layperson anyway
[3:31:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:31:21] <ingman112> So you’re saying Nier Automata has a badge points system?

[3:31:29] <iacus_> 7 cap but 0 invested lol
[3:31:29] <Johannen> Goes up to 10
[3:31:31] <+Ropcord> you can also turn off your OS for more space and it is a very good and smart move
[3:31:32] <heemwizard> perfect for ULTRALIBERAL HARRY

[3:57:37] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:57:37] <Blackleafx> woolie this is hard progression
[3:57:39] <+Bitscreed> Fair do's
[3:57:42] <%Juriasu> you saved so you could go out and reload until you fail
[3:57:43] <primaryfire> 🤷
[3:57:44] <+mechslayer71> You let’s the bonus disappear
[3:57:50] <Blank9> woolie you just go back to dialogue
[3:57:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you get a thought but still gotta reroll later
[3:57:52] <heemwizard> you get a bonus thought
[3:57:52] <Johannen> New Thoughts said someone
[3:57:54] <Blank9> it's a white check so you could try again
[3:57:54] <WeepyDevil> you embaress yourself a bunch
[3:57:56] <jorniev> you just look like an asshole
[3:58:02] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> you embarrass yourself like an asshole
[3:58:05] <Lancaster_H> its a white check, you just loop back @WoolieVersus
[3:58:06] <WeepyDevil> there's a suicide thought
[3:58:06] <%Vigonept> It was assholes woolies
[3:58:07] <%doomerskeletor13> It just adds some new dialogue throughout the game too
[3:58:08] <derap41> A cool thought
[3:58:09] <heemwizard> about wanting to kill yourself
[3:58:10] <Blackleafx> the bonus thought lets you commit suicide
[3:58:11] <SomeAsianDood> it's a suicide thought
[3:58:13] <%heysamuel> "finger on the eject button"
[3:58:18] <Futurecity10> Its nothing worth while
[3:58:18] <+glgzephyr> @Blackleafx I don't think you actually need to succeed on this check to beat the game. You do miss a lot of shit though
[3:58:18] <tomo_vendor> @WeepyDevil woolie did that one already
[3:58:18] <heemwizard> FINGER ON THE EJECT BUTTON
[3:58:20] <%heysamuel> it does nothing for you

[3:58:24] <iacus_> but it's a fail thought
[3:58:26] <Indigo_Automaton> Just go with the win
[3:58:26] <andre11dr> No keep this ffs
[3:58:27] <%doomerskeletor13> You can retry it too, it’s not a red check
[3:58:27] <Fuji808> Just play the game, Woolie.
[3:58:27] <+zepelinnn1> its not worth the reload
[3:58:29] <dukenux> Content
[3:58:30] <WeepyDevil> you already got all the content of this thought
[3:58:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> do you want to have to pump another point into auth after that to reroll though?
[3:58:31] <+Afrobrawler> not worth
[3:58:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @woolieversus Its a thought to help you pass that specific check
[3:58:32] <WakeUpThrow> Is it worth it though? You passed the check, it's fine
[3:58:32] <%servicesuspension> no, just keep this
[3:58:33] <%AmuserName> RELOAD
[3:58:33] <jorniev> FINGER IN THE EJECT BUTTON!?
[3:58:35] <Estwilde> Don't worry about it Woolie. Just play it straight :)

[3:58:39] <DSD24> Roll with it
[3:58:39] <Picia000123> stay on this, it's fine Woolie
[3:58:41] <andre11dr> Don't reload
[3:58:41] <derap41> Its bit reallt worth it
[3:58:42] <Indigo_Automaton> The thought won't be of use to you
[3:58:43] <Blank9> you get like 3 lines of dialogue and back to the tree
[3:58:45] <%kewlmyc> Not worth it honestly, but it's your playthrough
[3:58:45] <+zepelinnn1> fuck off chat, let him play
[3:58:45] <%servicesuspension> just roll with the punches
[3:58:46] <ingman112> Just play, you’re fine

[4:22:25] <%doomerskeletor13> The first option and not telling him anything both make Kim go down

[4:22:38] <%heysamuel> save, talk to man in purple?
[4:22:39] <%kyh9> The real boss is against real life discomfort
[4:22:41] <ingman112> @cutemuteprude Shhh
[4:22:42] <+aartbastiaan> calm your tits chat
[4:22:43] <andre11dr> Also there's a purple dude
[4:22:47] <primaryfire> @jorniev saying "I didn't rape her"
[4:22:49] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s another check later in the game that I know Woolie will reload if he fails
[4:22:50] <+meniscate> not gonna overexplain. overexplains

[4:23:09] <jorniev> I said that
[4:23:12] <die_hardman> Lol why did woolie reload? Was the option that  uncomfortable for him?
[4:23:14] <%heysamuel> smoker <3
[4:23:22] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s so… different
[4:23:25] <elshadow7> Check the window
[4:23:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> 4
[4:23:32] <derap41> @Sebenoth lets be real chat would have a fit if they didn't of couse chat will always have a fit
[4:23:38] <+Bitscreed> 4 please dear god 4
[4:23:40] <primaryfire> if what you say in this game had no significance then there would be no point in playing it
[4:23:43] <+aartbastiaan> @die_hardman people keep talking about "Kim points" like they're super important and like one wrong choice ruins everything..
[4:23:46] <%Deft_Thought> @Sebenoth That's a pretty disingenuous argument when people are saying "Pick 1, there's content!!!"
[4:23:48] <%illusiveSaint> do 4 last
[4:23:50] <Indigo_Automaton> DansGame Moralist
[4:23:50] <Eger007> HOMOSEXUAL UNDERGROUND LETS GO

[4:23:51] <andre11dr> I like how he calls you jandarme
[4:23:51] <%OblivionSword1> wait is it time for the window ?

[4:23:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> Man Woolie really hates Moralist :)
[4:24:03] <dukenux> oh you visited the moralist? damn i missed that
[4:24:06] <+GingerStrawhat> Sunday Friend
[4:24:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, put on COMPOSURE equipment, get Chat's boost and pick 4 for the love of god. It is ACTUAL Content.

[4:24:27] <%doomerskeletor13> God I want him to pass that check so badly
[4:24:32] <+aartbastiaan> I fucked with Kim all game but was a good cop and he never hated me, he can take it
[4:24:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Mads Mikkelsen
[4:24:39] <die_hardman> @aartbastiaan lol he would only lose “KIM points” if he did not finish the line of convo. So silly.
[4:24:40] <%heysamuel> my favorite check in the game, but i am biased
[4:24:45] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> Oh i dont agree with the reasons ppl said to pick 1.. its just that it felt pretty obvious it was a terrible choice
[4:24:46] <dukenux> <3
[4:24:49] <aiutare47> I love this guy intensely
[4:25:00] <penitentpendant> @elshadow7 It unlocks after the convo with her then them, since it gets them to be more cooperative. If I remember rightly.

[4:45:46] <+glgzephyr> @WoolieVersus You can ask Kim about the pissing competition.
[4:45:51] <%doomerskeletor13> That option doesn’t appear unless you’ve gotten the fascist thought
[4:45:53] <zanzibarian_hamster> It's to simulate how easy it is to have an accidental gamer moment
[4:46:06] <ingman112> @glgzephyr Didn’t he already do that?
[4:46:14] <+glgzephyr> @ingman112 I just checked his tasks
[4:46:15] <tattleworm> ???

[4:47:31] <+glgzephyr> Bagging the body sends Kim away
[4:47:37] <iacus_> pissing competition, too
[4:47:38] <Johannen> Bag the body during hte night
[4:47:40] <mariothemaio> Bag the body at the end of the day, Kim will go for the whole day if you do it now
[4:47:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't forget you can now follow the car tracks to see where they ultimately lead to.
[4:47:44] <%doomerskeletor13> You can wait till the end of the day if you want Kim to stay with you
[4:47:44] <dukenux> that sends Kim away
[4:47:46] <snuffkins> You should do it late in the day
[4:47:48] <+Vivaciousx3> bagging the body will make kim leave for the rest of the day
[4:47:50] <snuffkins> It sends kim off
[4:47:53] <dukenux> you sure you don't want to do it later?
[4:48:02] <+justianxix> wait
[4:48:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> You lose kim for the rest of the day
[4:48:03] <dukenux> there it is
[4:48:03] <derap41> I'm sure that's fine
[4:48:04] <+spelltrigger> no
[4:48:04] <%OblivionSword1> aBagging the body send kim away for the rest of the day
[4:48:05] <%heysamuel> bag and tag at the end of the day

[4:48:06] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah don't do that till later
[4:48:09] <%servicesuspension> Light spoilers: You can put the body away in the mall I think
[4:48:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do that at the end of the day
[4:48:09] <%purps26> do it at the end of the day
[4:48:11] <diddlerriddler> wait until the very end of the day
[4:48:13] <%servicesuspension> In the fridge

[4:48:18] <+mechslayer71> Do it at the end of the day
[4:48:21] <heemwizard> You can bag the body at night
[4:48:22] <ingman112> End of the day
[4:48:25] <teefpal> Put the body somewhere else

[4:48:26] <+GingerStrawhat> Nah just end of day
[4:48:30] <diddlerriddler> also time STOPS at 2am
[4:48:32] <+glgzephyr> @servicesuspension I think they only get that option if they haven't fully examined the body, right?
[4:48:32] <tattleworm> literally any time before he goes to bed
[4:48:33] <teefpal> They're gonna take the body
[4:48:42] <%servicesuspension> I'm not sure tho
[4:48:42] <+Afrobrawler> @WoolieVersus  You can do it at the end of the day and kim will be fine
[4:48:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:48:43] <LlewynMarie> The other end of the map
[4:48:44] <%dalmek> @servicesuspension that's only if you haven't gotten bullet from inside (so you can retry the check)
[4:48:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> You can do it at the very end of the game, it's fine.
[4:48:49] <%servicesuspension> :(
[4:48:52] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> let's explore the new section of map!

[4:50:02] <MrPedrovsky> HSWP HSWP HSWP HSWP HSWP HSWP
[4:50:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> We will get him on the drugs
[4:50:09] <+glgzephyr> @Fuji808 Time just stops progressing. You can still do anything that doesn't involve people that are asleep
[4:50:10] <+Ropcord> except for that one time
[4:50:12] <derap41> We get to screech even more
[4:50:14] <andre11dr> So Disco almost killed Woolie today, but actually for real
[4:50:18] <mariothemaio> it's fun until it wasn't
[4:50:18] <RENTARIM> at 2am time stops moving forward
[4:50:19] <+glgzephyr> No penalties for staying up forever
[4:50:21] <primaryfire> it's very non invasive
[4:50:26] <%servicesuspension> Just don't take the percentages as gospel and it's all right
[4:50:30] <+GingerStrawhat> Also when you know to ignore the fuck out of us
[4:50:32] <iacus_> you can count on me
[4:50:34] <+mechslayer71> They  stopping? Well, at least we made it out of the building LUL

[4:50:47] <mariothemaio> no, it was a final cut addition
[4:50:48] <iacus_> added with the FC
[4:50:49] <diddlerriddler> altogether, so you can read books without worrying about the time commitment
[4:50:49] <%OblivionSword1> it's final cut
[4:50:51] <Estwilde> It was added with this new release
[4:51:06] <andre11dr> Sometimes chat will screw you just for the fuck of it
[4:51:12] <%harmadill0> how's that back?
