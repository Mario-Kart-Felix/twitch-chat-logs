[0:21:48] <Super_Voltekka> This stream needs more hoes and wine LUL
[0:21:49] <+ChrisAlgoo> polnareff's animation is weirdly smooth?
[0:21:55] <guymontag0> Still deep in the ocean, Anubis eventually lost his mind.
[0:21:57] <+primax104> Go Requiem!
[0:22:08] <%glgzephyr> man I always hate charge characters
[0:22:16] <%jetjagger222> polnareff supers are great

[0:22:18] <+Proxzo> This spritework is amazing
[0:22:45] <%ChoculaUltra> counta!
[0:22:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:46] <%jetjagger222> @Proxzo they look better with the filters off
[0:22:46] <guymontag0> Now that I think about it, how did DIO convince a sentient stand to work for him? I forgot some details.
[0:22:47] <+Quinn_Carter> Oh god the sound
[0:22:49] <Kusano123> no blood in this version?
[0:23:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> the only charge character I played was the final boss in mark of the wolves and that's cuz he a boss
[0:23:05] <+Proxzo> That Chad pose anubis
[0:23:10] <+Proxzo> Is this filter on or off?
[0:23:17] <%jetjagger222> on
[0:23:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> filter on
[0:23:24] <%glgzephyr> @guymontag0 I don't believe that's ever explored
[0:23:25] <+primax104> pretty sure this had Chariot requi
[0:23:26] <%jetjagger222> some of the details are gone
[0:23:26] <+Proxzo> oh yeah, paint daubs
[0:23:27] <SoromopsEX> "Checka"
[0:23:33] <Nekros4442> Did Minh not watch Jojos?
[0:23:33] <crimsonsaens> Filter is on because Woolie hates beautiful sprites
[0:23:33] <KingSpunf> Trying to animate those bizarre Jojo poses is a thing to behold
[0:23:36] <+ChrisAlgoo> what is this smash bros

[0:23:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> MAXIMUM CHARIOT

[0:24:00] <venomryu> no no no no no
[0:24:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SLICED
[0:24:10] <crimsonsaens> What does the Anubis install do?
[0:24:13] <+primax104> @ozavic right, I think Ive only seen it once
[0:24:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> maybe he offered Anubis a bunch of sexy sword babes

[0:25:03] <UnfilteredComic> Part 5
[0:25:03] <%ChoculaUltra> in fact, the reason Young Joseph is in the game is because they did a what-if thing with Alessi in the story mode iirc
[0:25:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's just an asshole who only want's to fight weak people
[0:25:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes not a pedo, he just really feels better beating up kids

[0:25:49] <%Solidnick18> RERORERORERO
[0:25:51] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus he beats up kids because he's too cowardly to fight adults
[0:25:51] <worldbrand> he turns you into a child and then fights you shirtless in the rain
[0:25:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> he just likes beat up children and weakling
[0:25:54] <%glgzephyr> what did Kakyoin just fucking do

[0:29:01] <%ChoculaUltra> Midler is NOT esports friendly.
[0:29:03] <%SuperKirby24> YUS woolieGASM
[0:29:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is her only appearance
[0:29:08] <+mister_rogers> ah i saw ps4 controllers and second guessed myself
[0:29:13] <%jetjagger222> Fun fact: this midler design was a tweaked yukako
[0:29:15] <NevikGamina> Midler Kreygasm
[0:29:15] <trickquestionz> Submarine bitch. This design was made up for this game.
[0:29:19] <+mashinchaserr> SourPls
[0:29:22] <%Solidnick18> TIME
[0:29:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Midler confirmed Core Values
[0:29:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> she cut the string
[0:29:29] <zenith0111> TIME STOP 4Head
[0:29:46] <guymontag0> Fun Fact: Midler’s Design was created by Araki himself
[0:29:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:47] <+Chronobot> remember that puppet shit, not araki
[0:29:50] <zamzoph> Only evil people mind control!
[0:29:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Kakyoin is legit top tier in this game, him and Rubber Soul are fucked up strong.
[0:29:52] <%glgzephyr> he turned good?
[0:29:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's immoral and can kill people
[0:29:56] <+xerotwo> NERFED
[0:29:57] <trickquestionz> Death 13
[0:29:58] <+天使42199> araki forgot ?
[0:29:59] <%SuperKirby24> Araki forgot LUL
[0:29:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> so he stopped
[0:30:00] <zenith0111> Emerald Splash is the move name LUL
[0:30:00] <LeaIsChill> Mind controls her and tries to have her commit suicide
[0:30:01] <DukeBlack_> It wasn't mind control. He was literally inside her body
[0:30:02] <JaseAdrift> Mindcontrol is evil
[0:30:06] <KingSpunf> Kakyoin only uses hispower for good
[0:30:06] <%jinking79> have to thank capcom for askin for Midler design
[0:30:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He controls Death 13 too
[0:30:14] <%glgzephyr> yeah no mind control, just lethal body control
[0:30:17] <+Xero_J> Was that Kakyoin or just the brain thing that let him do it?
[0:30:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> she is revealed later in a extra thing
[0:30:28] <zamzoph> They fucked up her face because they beat her stand
[0:30:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:30:30] <guymontag0> @dragkudo And he ends up doing that later so it isn’t really Araki forgot
[0:30:30] <%DensityD> her visual design was invented for this game
[0:30:36] <%DensityD> based on in-betweens
[0:30:39] <UnfilteredComic> This is an original design made for this game
[0:30:50] <+SuplexChardonnay> IIRC he just put his stand inside of them and puppeteered their bodies, which is super evil
[0:30:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its invented for this game and the game makers just used Yukako panels for her art
[0:30:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> so yeah, based on in between
[0:31:05] <zenith0111> Eat his ass woolz!
[0:31:22] <crimsonsaens> yeah
[0:31:23] <UnfilteredComic> Close H
[0:31:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Her design is Araki but if you look most her art panels are just Yukako's
[0:31:34] <SoromopsEX> Throws are like in Guilty Gear
[0:31:46] <+Hinasil> But how can she block the Emerald Splaish?
[0:31:51] <%glgzephyr> now that's karma
[0:31:57] <crimsonsaens> qcf S
[0:32:01] <UnfilteredComic> Hadoken S
[0:32:05] <SoromopsEX> 214S
[0:32:06] <guymontag0> They should’ve made THE SUN into a character
[0:32:11] <%SuperKirby24> FEET
[0:32:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOAH
[0:32:16] <%jetjagger222> @guymontag0 he's in the super story mode in the psx versoin
[0:32:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> See thats Yukako pose
[0:32:22] <%prime_name> Midler's sprite is godlike
[0:32:30] <%jinking79> Milk Blood
[0:32:35] <Ozavic> A little late, but I love the idea of Kakyion stopping using his mind control ability because it's a coward's (evil) ability where as, once freed, he's mostly a long range fighter.

[0:35:48] <@Solidus_113> all this bar
[0:35:50] <+TopTieramisu> so alessi's power does nothing to dio
[0:36:03] <%jetjagger222> @TopTieramisu he turns into nukesaku
[0:36:09] <%glgzephyr> imagine if we got an ASW JoJo's fighting game with the same love and devotion they show to GG and DBFZ
[0:36:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Shadow Dio turns into Wang Chun with Dios head iirc
[0:36:16] <+patrickng714> yeah
[0:36:22] <Super_Voltekka> Ice as a sub-boss is pathetically easy in this game if you study his pattern
[0:36:24] <DDDorsett> One of VI's supers is him kicking the shit out of you
[0:36:37] <Super_Voltekka> I got a double perfect with Black Polnareff once
[0:36:42] <GeltonZ> @glgzephyr ArcSys already said they never will because this game already exists.
[0:36:48] <%glgzephyr> fair enough
[0:36:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:36:49] <+patrickng714> i wish Arc Sys made a Jojo game
[0:36:50] <Super_Voltekka> Scored me a ton of points in Arcade mode
[0:36:55] <%Haarute> not even baby platinum, just jotaro's BARE FISTS.
[0:36:58] <%KoyFoster> JOtaor did that with his bare fists.
[0:37:00] <Ozavic> Jotaro didn't have a baby plat, he just punched
[0:37:02] <tacostarvedbeast> doesnt jotaro just punch him as a kid since he didnt have a stand at a kid?
[0:37:03] <+TopTieramisu> jotaro was designed with the philosophy of "always win"
[0:37:05] <%glgzephyr> OMG
[0:37:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DEAD
[0:37:08] <%Irridium> oh my god little vanilla ice is so adorable
[0:37:12] <UnfilteredComic> By moving
[0:37:15] <DukeBlack_> The problem with a new jojo fighting game would be the roster. Who gets and who won't
[0:37:20] <+patrickng714> @toptieramisu except in Stone Ocean
[0:37:23] <DDDorsett> Vanilla ice is super busted in this
[0:37:23] <UnfilteredComic> Unblockable, set patterns
[0:37:27] <+linSP> you just die 4Head
[0:37:29] <@Solidus_113> Do you dare try and see if anyone's online
[0:37:30] <+TopTieramisu> @patrickng714 fine, part 3 jotaro
[0:37:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> cmonBruh Polnareff
[0:37:42] <%Solidnick18> Oh
[0:37:48] <tacostarvedbeast> lets get serious
[0:37:48] <%Solidnick18> the sword
[0:37:50] <zenith0111> MY MAN
[0:37:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Who's playing jojo on ps3 at 11 at night???
[0:37:54] <+TopTieramisu> my head canon is jotaro is the anti-body of the joestar family line to rid it of dio
[0:37:57] <+patrickng714> main Jojos and main villains would get in
[0:38:10] <joshua_42> Im upset that I didn’t get notified about a new Core-A Gaming video
[0:38:12] <Super_Voltekka> Dio in this game is voiced by the who was also Jedah Dohma
[0:38:19] <FullMetalEmblem> yo petshop best char in game doh
[0:38:25] <Dalkalopagus> A fighting game now would have to be just focused on one or two parts.
[0:38:26] <+patrickng714> obvious main supporting characters
[0:38:28] <guymontag0> Who also voices Jin Kazama
[0:38:38] <+TopTieramisu> i mean this game has so much darkstalker energy
[0:38:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> That sprite dodge tho
[0:38:42] <jacknerik> PogChamp
[0:38:44] <spardanwarrior> Say what you will about All-Star Battle, but at least it had a solid roster
[0:38:46] <mr_ESB> All star battle had so much potential :(
[0:38:47] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Pet Shop is best in a legit broken way, Kakyoin and Rubber Soul are the best in an actual fair character way.
[0:38:47] <+badjab326> "Woolie Versus Jojo's Thanks for the code Capcom!!"
[0:38:52] <%jinking79> Never get to play as DIO with the jacket
[0:38:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> eyes of heaven was so ass man...we're never getting another jojo game are we?
[0:38:58] <+patrickng714> All Star Battle had good ideas
[0:39:01] <joshua_42> Can ArcSys work on a 2D Jojo game?
[0:39:06] <%prime_name> Merci~
[0:39:09] <@Solidus_113> Black Polnareff does what regular couldn't
[0:39:20] <guymontag0> Pet Shop is like Zero. Every game he’s in will end with him top tier. Of course that was only two but still.
[0:39:21] <SheefEatsBeef> black polnareff can say it
[0:39:25] <spardanwarrior> All style but little substance
[0:39:27] <GeltonZ> @joshua_42 Nope. They already said they won't because this game exists.
[0:39:32] <+TopTieramisu> @FuqBoiSlim maybe after they animate part 8 :)
[0:39:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[0:39:34] <mr_ESB> ASB had taunt cancels and taunt restand combos
[0:39:35] <@Solidus_113> WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[0:39:35] <+patrickng714> did they make All Star Battle into 60fps inn the western release?
[0:39:36] <SheefEatsBeef> YEYEYEYEY
[0:39:38] <odd_slater> They got Persona's to work I'm sure they could do JoJo

[0:40:16] <+TopTieramisu> does this game have Chariot Requiem?
[0:40:20] <joshua_42> Knife combo
[0:40:21] <@Solidus_113> no
[0:40:26] <%Solidnick18> ROAD ROLLA
[0:40:32] <%jetjagger222> @TopTieramisu yes, bellieve it or not
[0:40:33] <crimsonsaens> It has Chariot Requiem, but it's kind of bad
[0:40:37] <SoromopsEX> Chariot Requiem is a super
[0:40:37] <guymontag0> I like how DIO’s plan to kill an enemy was finding some construction equipment. What a nut.
[0:40:42] <%glgzephyr> is this not available for purchase on PS3 PSN?
[0:40:45] <+xerotwo> I would have loved to see Part 5's cast in this
[0:40:46] <mr_ESB> All star battle juggle combos look really cool
[0:40:50] <joshua_42> Not anymore @glgzephyr
[0:40:50] <adimcorner> @toptieramisu no, part 3 and part 2 Joseph only
[0:40:50] <+TopTieramisu> ok, so does chariot requiem do the Ginyu?
[0:40:54] <%glgzephyr> RIP
[0:40:55] <philorobo> Were there even requiem stands when this game came out?
[0:41:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Voing
[0:41:14] <guymontag0> @glgzephyr Damn licenses takes another game
[0:41:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> this game came out when part 5 was still publishing huh?

[0:41:34] <%Solidnick18> Shadow dio*
[0:41:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Metal Gear Boingo
[0:41:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah, part 4 started in '95 so it checks out
[0:41:47] <FlamingNarwhal> now THIS is a fight
[0:41:47] <crimsonsaens> This is the origin of Carl Clover
[0:41:49] <+TopTieramisu> hol horse, the man who was too powerful to be part of the main crew
[0:41:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> *part 5
[0:41:57] <TopTierHarley> puppet character
[0:42:01] <+patrickng714> part 4 is set in 1999
[0:42:03] <spardanwarrior> Requiem is half-circle back 2 attacks, it isn't on the movelist.
[0:42:09] <+patrickng714> came out in 95
[0:42:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GW was running in actual 99
[0:42:32] <joshua_42> Did they do the hanged man super with Hol Horse?
[0:42:32] <zenith0111> KEKEKE
[0:42:35] <mf_doomfist98> Man this game is great I came in at a good time
[0:42:39] <JetpackMcQuack> One of my favourite episodes
[0:42:43] <+TopTieramisu> wait, this game came out before part 5?
[0:42:46] <crimsonsaens> @joshua_42 no
[0:42:54] <zenith0111> BEWARE THE DOLL
[0:42:56] <+TopTieramisu> oh, you corrected yourself. it came out during part 5
[0:42:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> @toptieramisu no during
[0:43:02] <mr_ESB> Whens bird? WutFace
[0:43:15] <guymontag0> Shadow DIO, Kan/Chan, Young Joseph, Pet Shop, Kak and New Kak hasn’t been picked yet.
[0:43:17] <+patrickng714> fun fact, Vanilla Ice in this game reprises Ice in the anime
[0:43:18] <%glgzephyr> this bullet direction
[0:43:23] <mf_doomfist98> What’s the difference between regular and boingo with hol horse?
[0:43:28] <SomersaultJustice> N'doul isn't playable in this game right?
[0:43:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @TopTieramisu If you look at Midler's model on the sidebars when you pick her it's in Part 5 style
[0:43:40] <+linSP> so thats why theyre called stands
[0:43:41] <guymontag0> @mf_doomfist98 Regular Horse has hanged man
[0:43:46] <%glgzephyr> @mf_doomfist98 Boingo lets you read your opponent's inputs
[0:43:46] <Ozavic> @SomersaultJustice Yes, he is not playable, he's a minigame
[0:43:46] <%jetjagger222> @SomersaultJustice no just a bonus boss
[0:43:52] <zenith0111> Except when their like only 2meter range
[0:43:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20

[0:43:55] <+demonkingk13> gun
[0:43:55] <+SuplexChardonnay> Boingo did nothing
[0:43:57] <spardanwarrior> N'doul is part of a bonus stage in arcade mode
[0:43:59] <zenith0111> VOING
[0:43:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> UNBEATABLE
[0:44:04] <FullMetalEmblem> lmao
[0:44:07] <%jetjagger222> death 13 is also a bonus boss
[0:44:09] <mf_doomfist98> @glgzephyr had no idea that’s crazy
[0:44:16] <+projectmanatees> hol horse boiongo coooombie

[0:44:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 28 minutes
[0:44:41] <spardanwarrior> Just some barber
[0:44:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> No hes the next one
[0:44:43] <mr_ESB> Part 2 Joseph is in this? O_o how good is he?
[0:44:47] <UnfilteredComic> After Chaka
[0:44:51] <Heyestus> Chaka Kan
[0:44:52] <%Haarute> this guy is the dumb barber.
[0:44:52] <UnfilteredComic> The Barber
[0:44:53] <@Solidus_113> Barber
[0:44:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Barber guy
[0:44:54] <+patrickng714> the PS1 version has a huge story mode for this
[0:44:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yes
[0:44:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> he was the barber
[0:44:58] <crimsonsaens> Turn off the filter
[0:44:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its CHaca then Khan
[0:45:00] <adimcorner> after Chaka
[0:45:01] <%glgzephyr> what is this crazy ass DIO moveset
[0:45:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Chaca Khan
[0:45:03] <+TopTieramisu> dio has awful posture
[0:45:04] <%Solidnick18> oh the barber guy?
[0:45:04] <trickquestionz> This feels like an uneven matchup
[0:45:07] <GeltonZ> @mr_ESB Apparently he's OK. He gets used in tournaments.
[0:45:08] <adimcorner> barber
[0:45:13] <+patrickng714> i think it pretty much adapts Stardust Crusasers
[0:45:16] <SheefEatsBeef> space ripper stingy eyes
[0:45:17] <@Solidus_113> 3 even
[0:45:17] <guymontag0> Vampires has no need for posture
[0:45:19] <UnfilteredComic> 3
[0:45:19] <crimsonsaens> 3 characters
[0:45:21] <TopTierHarley> 3
[0:45:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> THREE characters to Anubis
[0:45:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its 3 if you count Polnareff Black
[0:45:26] <%Haarute> 2 and a half
[0:45:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> THREE
[0:45:29] <LeaIsChill> Anubis was the shit for Part 3 fans back in the day you don't even know
[0:45:30] <%Haarute> MORE than Dio.
[0:45:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> black polnareff
[0:45:37] <JetpackMcQuack> Damn sword users
[0:45:37] <+SuplexChardonnay> 3 characters from one of the most forgettable arcs, lol
[0:45:40] <crimsonsaens> Turn off the sprite filter, Woolie
[0:45:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> > Sword users Kappa
[0:45:45] <GeltonZ> Chaka and Kan? Oh geeze. I get it now.
[0:45:46] <philorobo> If you can squeeze the characters outta Anubis, then do it
[0:45:49] <Heyestus> Imagine how sick it'd be if anubis just got chaka round one then Khan after
[0:45:54] <mopoloking> anubis spin off?
[0:45:56] <+projectmanatees> lewd doujin? Kappa
[0:45:59] <philorobo> What else you gonna have, The Sun?
[0:46:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> dead
[0:46:02] <@Solidus_113> They put in 3 Anubis but not The Fly
[0:46:03] <adimcorner> well, the idea is anyone can be the user
[0:46:04] <mr_ESB> Oh shit Part 2 Joseph has clacker combos

[0:47:02] <guymontag0> @legacy0117 He doesn’t have the stand mechanic, no
[0:47:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> @guymontag0 I thought that whole game was lame tbh
[0:47:05] <mr_ESB> Wishing for an All star battle 2 :(
[0:47:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> @maplemilllk ps3
[0:47:08] <FullMetalEmblem> ooo yea, ice is broken
[0:47:10] <@Solidus_113> WHERE'S WHEEL OF FORTUNE

[0:47:17] <guymontag0> @fuqboislim True.
[0:47:22] <mr_ESB> Shizzaaaaaa
[0:47:26] <Thunderhog> I love how young joseph is just jojo
[0:47:27] <%SuperKirby24> jojo vs jojo PogChamp
[0:47:30] <%Solidnick18> HAMON
[0:47:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> what about the vampire goblin fuck who makes the house look bigger than it is
[0:47:36] <+TopTieramisu> will kamikaze douga ever work on another jojo opening?
[0:47:41] <mr_ESB> Clacker volley clacker volley
[0:47:42] <UnfilteredComic> "NO!"
[0:47:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SHIIIIZAAAA! :(
[0:47:47] <+TheRisingPride> Isn't one of his moves just Tommy gun?
[0:47:50] <Thunderhog> SHIZAAAAAAAA
[0:47:53] <%glgzephyr> if you run away with Joseph, is that crossbow actually useful
[0:47:53] <+TopTieramisu> the first 2 jojo openings are still the peak of jojo openings
[0:47:59] <T_Sasquatch> cant believe hes called jojo LUL
[0:48:00] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> CAESAAAAAR BibleThump
[0:48:05] <+RowenCleric> what about Darby and then just turn this into a poker game instead of a fighting game
[0:48:12] <ZippyPsycho> The secret technique?
[0:48:12] <Halospaz117> Ya ever just super someone with your grief over your dead friend?
[0:48:21] <%jetjagger222> @RowenCleric that's also in the super story mode in the psx version
[0:48:21] <+patrickng714> will Jojolion finish by the time the anime adapts Steel Ball Run?
[0:48:31] <guymontag0> Because of them naming JoJo, I thought this guy was super important in the story. And then I just realized it was Young Joseph. Don’t know why they just didn’t call him that in the US version.
[0:48:36] <+RowenCleric> whaaaaat really!?
[0:48:38] <%jetjagger222> the lovers is a shmup stage with chariot and hierophant
[0:48:46] <%jetjagger222> it should be on youtube
[0:48:46] <Dalkalopagus> I can't imagine there's more than a year of jojolion left
[0:48:48] <+demonkingk13> time to hit the secret tech
[0:48:51] <%jinking79> that manga not ending anytime soon
[0:48:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> @patrickng714 we're getting close to the endgame in jojolion tbh. it might
[0:48:54] <%Solidnick18> YES
[0:48:55] <mr_ESB> Hamon beato
[0:49:00] <@Solidus_113> I'm not seeing the tommy gun in the movelist
[0:49:09] <+TopTieramisu> tommy gun is the best jojo move
[0:49:10] <zamzoph> character-establishing moment
[0:49:11] <philorobo> Jojolion actually is never going to end, it just goes on forever
[0:49:12] <trickquestionz> The gun is in eyes of heavan
[0:49:14] <Ozavic> I don't think he does in this game
[0:49:14] <%jinking79> no tommy gun
[0:49:14] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> He gets the thompson as a super in All Star Battle
[0:49:18] <crimsonsaens> Show off Chariot Requiem
[0:49:24] <+patrickng714> have they revealed the main villain Jojolion yet?
[0:49:27] <%Haarute> ONE episode into Battle Tendency and by the end of it you're like "okay, let's go"
[0:49:30] <adimcorner> he opens with the gun
[0:49:31] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:49:32] <%SuperKirby24> @legacy0117 I meaaaan Kappa
[0:49:34] <Ozavic> I used to play him in tourney, so I feel like I'd remember that
[0:49:36] <%jetjagger222> part 4 jotaro!
[0:49:40] <+Deadpool2450> got the good jotaro colors
[0:49:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> petshop and kakyoin are the strongest characters in the game
[0:49:40] <mr_ESB> Joseph has fun clacker combos in asb
[0:49:42] <MayorRev> dioooooo
[0:49:53] <T_Sasquatch> roaddd rolleaaa
[0:49:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> whatever color fits the vibe for the volume cover
[0:50:01] <%jinking79> hard to believe Kars and them were plan for the game
[0:50:02] <adimcorner> that's how you know he's badass, tommygun is a opening act
[0:50:06] <crimsonsaens> It takes 5 to do the meme combo, right?
[0:50:08] <trickquestionz> Special Move: Die
[0:50:10] <+TopTieramisu> man, kars would have been nuts
[0:50:14] <UnfilteredComic> Is there a training mode for meter?
[0:50:15] <@Solidus_113> I think summoning is just the laser eyes
[0:50:21] <Super_Voltekka> You get an achievement for activating the time stop at the time with both characters
[0:50:21] <guymontag0> The most consistent color seems to be is that Jotaro is blue
[0:50:26] <+TopTieramisu> all the pillar men would have been sick
[0:50:29] <MayorRev> ZA WARUDO
[0:50:35] <Super_Voltekka> They cancel each other out
[0:50:37] <%jetjagger222> that's how SPOILER got killed
[0:50:39] <+patrickng714> this game came out when Golden Wind was running right?
[0:50:49] <%SuperKirby24> iirc you can do 1 set of knives plus road roller for 5 bars
[0:50:53] <%glgzephyr> wait can Jotaro move in DIO's time stop super
[0:50:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:50:56] <%SuperKirby24> idk
[0:51:06] <crimsonsaens> Can we convince ArcSys to do a game around part 5?
[0:51:08] <@Solidus_113> you can gain bar on whiff too
[0:51:10] <guymontag0> @glgzephyr He can spend meter to do that
[0:51:14] <%glgzephyr> excellent
[0:51:21] <mr_ESB> Kars vs giorno with both transformation supers activated is so hype
[0:51:34] <%Wool> Just whiff your normals for meter
[0:51:36] <%SuperKirby24> is there no training mode in the ps3 ver?
[0:51:42] <+TopTieramisu> i mean, if giorno uses requiem, kars is fucked
[0:51:49] <guymontag0> @glgzephyr They also had that in All Star Battle and Eyes of Heaven
[0:52:03] <+TopTieramisu> wait a minute, kars is fucked against any stand user
[0:52:06] <@Solidus_113> time > checkmate > road roller
[0:52:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah I think the roster in this game is solid but I would've liked more non-part 3 characters. Josuke would've been cool
[0:52:14] <adimcorner> remember Jodie's Bizzare Adventure
[0:52:22] <%glgzephyr> Watching the guys play Eyes of Heaven was my first exposure to Jojo's
[0:52:25] <+TopTieramisu> kira would have been great for this game
[0:52:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> no chip
[0:52:34] <%Wool> That will gain meter if it whiffs too
[0:52:36] <+patrickng714> they should make a sequel to Eyes of Heaven that follows up on that game,'s ending
[0:52:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> just put the stars on max
[0:53:01] <TheRickMaster> hey its like dbfz dragonballs

[0:53:24] <+Deadpool2450> this is the true jojo's

[0:53:40] <guymontag0> This is how non stand users see any fight
[0:53:41] <crimsonsaens> Seeing Stop Time in a real match is always so sick
[0:53:48] <+patrickng714> imagine they make a theoretical part 4 Kakyoin, Avdol, and Iggy
[0:53:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah he might pull a leg muscle Kappa

[0:57:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> you end the round by comboing into the timestop
[0:57:14] <%glgzephyr> 8 seconds

[1:06:26] <chronoxgp> like 92 maybe 89 88 i could see that
[1:06:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, the game came out in 98
[1:06:33] <Sozu_> part 6 is 2000 iirc
[1:06:37] <Midnight188> https://clips.twitch.tv/SpinelessPlacidClipsmomPeteZaroll
[1:06:57] <chronoxgp> JoJo timeline actually is reffered to as post kid dracula
[1:06:57] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Space Ripper Stingy Eyes
[1:06:59] <trickquestionz> "I respect your willingness to pull a gun on me." -DIO

[1:07:03] <Ciriliko> its funny, bewcause i imagine DIO carrying Polnareff down stairs comically LUL
[1:07:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> part 3 came out in 89 and ended in 92
[1:07:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> man I thought part 6 was from like 2005 or something no. Steel Ball Run was running around that time
[1:07:08] <crimsonsaens> Do Requiem against timestop

[1:07:30] <chronoxgp> Stardust came ou tin 2014
[1:07:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> It blew my mind because one of the shonen jump games for the DS has a steel ball run cameo. the jojo blood runs deep
[1:07:40] <chronoxgp> the anime has lots of CGi
[1:07:40] <mr_ESB> Part 5 style stardust crew?
[1:07:42] <guymontag0> @choculaultra That’s the grossest thing I’ve seen all day

[1:08:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah u missed it
[1:08:03] <crimsonsaens> @CaptainPileDriver They just did it
[1:08:03] <chronoxgp> so this game is based on the manga
[1:08:06] <chronoxgp> from 92?
[1:08:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> i was looking at jojo
[1:08:11] <JustMeAndOtherPeople> Do both hol horses

[1:08:17] <%glgzephyr> it's fine, pop off was minor
[1:08:27] <+TopTieramisu> i actually like how teen jotaro looked in that flashback in part 5
[1:08:31] <+TopTieramisu> he actually looked his age
[1:08:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> @chronoxgp this was based on the mang from 6 years prior yes
[1:08:36] <trickquestionz> Even though we knew him since Part 1
[1:08:38] <Ciriliko> Chad Horse
[1:08:47] <TungstenViper> Joseph is a troll in this game as he is in the manga

[1:11:40] <Ciriliko> @glgzephyr Bold of you supossing the world is even existing in that time LUL
[1:11:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> man I thought the wait for part 4 is painful. I'm gonna die of Corona before I see Foo Fighters on my tv. I hate it
[1:11:46] <%glgzephyr> there we go
[1:11:49] <+TopTieramisu> inb4 jolyne is voiced by jotaro's VA
[1:11:51] <FlamingNarwhal> part 6 needs to come out so I can finally get Foo Fighters merch
[1:12:08] <+Brickshurt> Foo Fighters?
[1:12:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> I just want to see invisible mud zombies fight against living plankton
[1:12:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[1:12:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> @brickshurt a stand in part 6
[1:12:18] <+TopTieramisu> pull a DBZ and have every future joestar voiced by jotaro's VA
[1:12:21] <TungstenViper> you can literallys tune people with that move
[1:12:23] <mr_ESB> Theyve been changing va's since part 4 i think
[1:12:23] <%KoyFoster> Oingo and Boingo are the best.
[1:12:26] <joshua_42> Who is better Hermes or F.F.
[1:12:28] <%glgzephyr> what
[1:12:30] <+Brickshurt> @FuqBoiSlim Ah lmao
[1:12:30] <@Solidus_113> FF
[1:12:32] <UnfilteredComic> unblockable
[1:12:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> HERMES
[1:12:35] <Civet10> the bullet super is an unblockable projectile that you can redirect
[1:12:38] <FlamingNarwhal> FF is part 6 best girl
[1:12:43] <+2DSuperiority> They still have to figure out how to avoid the disney cops
[1:12:46] <+rednecked__crake> you can actually jump his 720 lmao, it's a super shitty super
[1:12:54] <mr_ESB> Part 3 had dio and jotaro voices from the games
[1:12:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> FF is a cool girl and healer, but i love Hermes
[1:12:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hermes is based but my heart belongs to F.F
[1:12:59] <TungstenViper> sh block is vital in this game
[1:13:09] <%KingLlama1> Timer Scam
[1:13:10] <guymontag0> @mr_esb Since Part 3 actually. The only Va that returned from All Star Battle’s was Jotaro’s.
[1:13:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> Hermes is best girl
[1:13:13] <%glgzephyr> Joseph's got that OMG face
[1:13:15] <+TopTieramisu> OH MY GOD
[1:13:23] <$ofloofy> i love the fuck out of this game
[1:13:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> he was supposed to take avdul's place
[1:13:26] <mr_ESB> And dio
[1:13:29] <Ciriliko> Hol Horse was a good guy
[1:13:32] <@Solidus_113> I think Alessi has some secrets against Shadow Dio and Old Joseph @WoolieVersus
[1:13:32] <Edible_Enthusiasm> gun stand was to overpowered
[1:13:32] <+TopTieramisu> hol horse was too OP to be part of the crew
[1:13:40] <masterfire23> araki never forgets
[1:13:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> READ PART 7
[1:13:44] <SheefEatsBeef> true
[1:13:45] <crimsonsaens> He's a coward, just like the 7th Stand User
[1:13:49] <+linSP> hol horse was the chosen one
[1:13:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK YEAH
[1:13:56] <Thunderhog> Also his stand is just GUN, which is a nice simple one for a jobro stand
[1:13:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> dont skip parts tho
[1:14:01] <Thunderhog> see mista
[1:14:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> ROPE MAN

[1:14:22] <%glgzephyr> this community has spoiled so much of JJBA for me
