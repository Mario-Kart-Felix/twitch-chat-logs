[0:34:03] <MyNameIsRasus> GIVE MINH THE PASS WOOLIE
[0:34:04] <+VHGS> HP Lovecraft was so racist that white people in like 1910 sent him letters saying "bro you are too racist calm down,"
[0:34:06] <%Irridium> HP lovecraft was a GAMER
[0:34:11] <GaimDS> Lovecraft was just a Proto incel Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:34:16] <Dapper_Cactuar> OH GOD WHY DID I LOOK IT UP

[0:34:22] <yeahthatalex> “Why do we always have to bring HP Lovecraft’s racism’s?”- person who didn’t know how racist he was
[0:34:22] <dapperskeleton69> smokey!
[0:34:22] <%BinaryFireball> so what is FURIOUS about this game?
[0:34:24] <天使42199> LOVECRAFT STARTED THE RACE WARS
[0:34:24] <SheefEatsBeef> to be fair, his dad named the cat
[0:34:27] <BearSawed> Lovecraft didnt enjoy other races
[0:34:29] <+TopTieramisu> @ChrisAlgoo i'd rather you not
[0:34:35] <kaine_west> Livecraft hated Italians and the Irish
[0:34:36] <%RioGascar> Wahts to stop youtube commenters
[0:34:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is the one true Racing Game
[0:34:37] <MyNameIsRasus> HP Lovecraft was a gamer confirmed
[0:34:37] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Now was the cat racist or a victim of racism
[0:34:42] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Maybe it's a misstranslation....
[0:34:43] <SainEdge> the soundtrack of this game has some serious bangers
[0:34:44] <Virokwet> Never meet your heroes
[0:34:44] <bladej4> doodStare how good is this?
[0:34:45] <+Manderson1998> hp lovecraft put the phobia in xenophobia
[0:34:55] <ChinMusicTwo> damn lovecraft started shitposting irl hundred years ago
[0:34:56] <%allups> thy only had like 2 episodes
[0:35:06] <gustavozxd> Lovecraft is from when
[0:35:08] <GaimDS> @angriestangryartist I'm sure it's a mistranslation of the English language Kappa
[0:35:11] <CasualAlohaFriday> There's a Garfield racing game? Are any U.S. Acres characters in this?
[0:35:11] <+jbaker009> @woolieversus my friend's dad has a pet crow with the same as Lovecrafts cat
[0:35:13] <+BoboDaHobo> Lovecraft was afraid of literally everything, of course he was a racist shit
[0:35:15] <%Solidnick18> seems pretty much like it
[0:35:16] <kingkeldeo31> Lovecraft: You thought I was a chill dude that wrote about eldrich horrors, but no filthy racist.
[0:35:19] <NZolozabal> "Oh no, somebody born in the late 1890s was racist!" THE MAN IS DEAD! GET OVER IT!
[0:35:20] <Aussie_Manny> Garfield and Friends was fantastic. Early Saturday mornings well spent. electr18Lv
[0:35:21] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:35:22] <%yeknomlive> is it like doc and marty garfield

[0:35:37] <+AngriestAngryArtist> @GaimDS could be a french name.
[0:35:37] <nothuzad> play GENSOU Skydrift you cowards :)
[0:35:43] <+TopTieramisu> lovecraft's greatest fear was reverse gentrification
[0:35:46] <+tearfuldevil> @BoboDaHobo other way around though
[0:35:50] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Lasagna bonus
[0:35:52] <am_omega> Nah its more than that.
[0:35:56] <Super_Voltekka> What's this Hydro Thunder bullshit doing in a Garfield game?
[0:35:58] <nothuzad> lovecrafts biggest fear was the irish
[0:35:58] <gustavozxd> 1890? atpRtsd
[0:35:58] <+Sochin_Iitsu> MAN I could go for some lasagna

[0:36:08] <dapperskeleton69> "i dont know what they do" AS HES ON THE ITEM SCREEN
[0:36:08] <%Solidnick18> that's a piza
[0:36:11] <GaimDS> a Lovecraft story literally ends with the protagonist going nuts about seeing a black woman Kappa
[0:36:15] <+Sochin_Iitsu> All's forgiven
[0:36:16] <am_omega> There was "Normal for the time" and "Bro that is legit hate"
[0:36:24] <coreybom> @nzolozabal Oh sweetheart you don't understand. He was SO racist that even other racist at the time thought he was too much.
[0:36:24] <Rhinoprotoss> 150cc cowards
[0:36:25] <am_omega> Lovecraft is the later.
[0:36:25] <Aussie_Manny> Lasagna is pasta cake. HahaThink
[0:36:29] <odiz395> btw did you guys here about The Dood having a kid ?
[0:36:33] <%Solidnick18> garfield just likes eating
[0:36:40] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Remember, even at the time Lovecraft was racist
[0:36:41] <%Solidnick18> Omg
[0:36:41] <ChinMusicTwo> cc means the amount of crack cocaine
[0:36:42] <Vyneci> 4Head
[0:36:43] <gustavozxd> oh no
[0:36:43] <+TopTieramisu> I'm Sorry Jon
[0:36:44] <MyNameIsRasus> Lovecraft was the original Time Cube
[0:36:44] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:36:45] <+tearfuldevil> also, people tend to ignore the people who WEREN'T racist for their time

[0:37:48] <dapperskeleton69> whos who
[0:37:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> this game hurts extra hard because I remember religiously watching the Garfield cgi cartoon this game is based off of
[0:37:49] <NZolozabal> Arlene wasn't in the cartoon to my knowledge.
[0:38:00] <%Infernal_Dalek> Waste of screen space
[0:38:01] <DaBigVitus> garfield and friends was sweet
[0:38:04] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Anyway, if you enjoy the feeling of having your soul sucked from your body, check out the MBMBAM bit about the Garfield Monstrosity
[0:38:08] <+TopTieramisu> i read the Garfield light novels

[0:38:17] <%Solidnick18> sonic team racing DansGame
[0:38:20] <%yeknomlive> i watched the garfield stage play to get all the lore
[0:38:22] <GaimDS> the Garfield isekai Anime was pretty good
[0:38:31] <%Prevot> snaking DansGame
[0:38:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:32] <+Manderson1998> I firmly believe sonic team racing shouldve had at least twice as many characters
[0:38:38] <am_omega> the true Garfield anime was the best.
[0:38:39] <dapperskeleton69> @gaimds pardon?
[0:38:43] <+TopTieramisu> garfield is an isekai of an eldritch horror living on earth
[0:38:52] <GaimDS> @dapperskeleton69 you heard me
[0:38:59] <%Valask> do you know what an isekai is man
[0:39:00] <NZolozabal> I forgot what year Jon and Liz started dating, but kudos for staying together for so long.

[0:41:52] <DedlokPM> @TopTieramisu The vet lady girlfriend of Jon? I am not 100% sure

[0:42:01] <%Solidnick18> that's why reggie
[0:42:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> underrated
[0:42:19] <%Ecchigun> it just works
[0:42:27] <GrandmasterBFunk> Woolie choosing the Ryu of Garfield Cart, typical.
[0:42:32] <+superorangerobin> Licensed Kart Racers have a surprisingly decent track record
[0:42:33] <+TopTieramisu> so... what about this game sets it apart from other kart racers?
[0:42:35] <NevikGamina> LUL

[2:01:24] <universaldove> Talk about SSStylsih

[2:01:29] <@Solidus_113> there's a guiding compass on your back window
[2:01:29] <%RioGascar> imma boot my copy up
[2:01:30] <SidewinderFang> this game is the dark souls of sonic games :P

[2:01:34] <%invisi_bliss> WE GOING THE DISTANCE
[2:01:42] <%croxeye> yo this is dope!
[2:01:51] <NevikGamina> can minh even play this when it turns red? LUL
[2:02:01] <TheDeimion> jump
[2:02:16] <dapperskeleton69> CAR TRICJS
[2:02:21] <BioApple> YOOOO DISTANCE
[2:02:32] <razielhex> This is like Wipeout, using Daytona USA models, in the world of SUPERHOT
[2:02:32] <@akuda_bar> @amardeux not how color blindness works. it doesn't make red shit invisible
[2:02:51] <NeroInfinite> Reggie can't think in4D
[2:02:55] <@akuda_bar> Reggie decreasing his distance
[2:02:57] <%RioGascar> You can fly too
[2:03:00] <@Squdnate> There's outlines
[2:03:05] <@Squdnate> So even if it was a colour you were blind to
[2:03:11] <%RioGascar> Its music is some good shit too
[2:03:12] <@Squdnate> You should be able to follow what is going on
[2:03:17] <Vyneci> Press B for placements
[2:03:29] <Vyneci> It also tells you how far from the end you are
[2:03:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:03:31] <supermexicansentai> This is pretty cool looking game
[2:03:38] <razielhex> @Amardeux I have Protanopia just like Minh does. Not being able to "see" red doesn't mean things that are red are invisible. It's about tinting & shading; as long as there's contrast it's fine. But there's a reason I have a hard time as BLU in TF2 because of all the brown & green environments.
[2:03:47] <%RioGascar> The kickstarter for this was literally “YO WE LIKE TRON AND WANNA MAKE A TRON RACER...YOU IN?”
[2:03:49] <+fsdagarha> I have no idea what's happening but it looks cool
[2:03:53] <@Squdnate> The mixin' is a bit wack
[2:04:03] <nothuzad> so Distance is the commercialized version of Nitronic Rush - which was the devs final prototype when finishing scool
[2:04:09] <%Solidnick18> abit trippy
[2:04:11] <nothuzad> also check out the nitronic rush OST its great
[2:04:16] <@akuda_bar> all music no commentary is optimal
[2:04:17] <%RioGascar> and even nitronic rush is good
[2:04:28] <SidewinderFang> the second campain in Distance is a remake of nitronic rush
[2:04:36] <nothuzad> RioGascar I actually prefer Nitronic rush in some ways
[2:04:38] <SidewinderFang> complete with remixed nitronic rush music
[2:04:54] <razielhex> what masochistic monster plays First Person racing games?
[2:04:57] <+fsdagarha> reminds me of kinetica, except it's cyber so they don't have to make any textures for tracks lol
[2:04:58] <NevikGamina> I get that, just prepping for Minh to johns it up with his colour blideness LUL
[2:04:59] <@Solidus_113> It's like Rush 2049
[2:05:06] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Hovercar
[2:05:11] <BoneBagMel> THOSE WIGNS ARE RUSH
[2:05:18] <NevikGamina> so yeah I know colour blindness don't work like htat
[2:05:24] <@Menitta> this is cool
[2:05:35] <%RioGascar> im hosting if people wanna join in and go the distance
[2:05:45] <%Prevot> this hurts to look at
[2:05:48] <Vyneci> Only problem is that the campaign acts as the tutorial, which is like an hour long LUL
[2:05:52] <dapperskeleton69> a e s t h e t i c
[2:05:52] <@Squdnate> Æstetik
[2:05:53] <@akuda_bar> a e s t h e t i c
[2:06:06] <dapperskeleton69> yeah i wish it wasnt so orange
[2:06:10] <Vyneci> Y'all should play the campaigns one day, they're AMAZING
[2:06:16] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> 【Ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ】
[2:06:19] <BioApple> This isn't the usual aesthetic of the game, this map does suck visually
[2:06:39] <Vyneci> If you want to barrel roll in the air, hold LB and then spin
[2:06:54] <TigerClaws12> bumpers to roll @WoolieVersus
[2:06:59] <SidewinderFang> I like how this map looks

[2:58:17] <am_omega> LUL
[2:58:22] <Vyneci> Yeah... turbines was not the best choice for a final level LUL
[2:58:47] <Azelstahn> some of the official levels were made by community members too.
[2:58:58] <%RioGascar> tried watching both stream and playing distance at same time in VR
[2:59:01] <%RioGascar> ow
[2:59:16] <Malucoblz02> i think i gonna hurl
[3:00:01] <Azelstahn> this level requires skills these guys know nothing about lol.

[3:00:39] <%Solidnick18> wtf is going on
[3:00:42] <jaybonejay> No this is an easy level compared to the latter levels
[3:00:58] <+VariantX7> I don't like it when the stages in a racer get too abstract for their own good
[3:01:06] <jaybonejay> like inferno
[3:01:06] <Azelstahn> it still needs a tad bit of thruster user though.
[3:01:17] <TigerClaws12> you have to jump and barrel roll half way through in that mountain LUL
[3:01:23] <+tearfuldevil> this game has some mecganics they don't seem to have figured out yet
[3:01:23] <+IamScorpius> What am I watching LUL
[3:01:25] <Vyneci> Disclaimer, this was originally a workshop track LUL
[3:01:31] <tranquilturnip> its easier to see on our end I think
[3:01:35] <jubejube56> So I presume they have to hit the multiple green tunnels to thrust to the finish?
[3:01:37] <jaybonejay> None of them have played the campaign
[3:01:57] <TigerClaws12> Woolie played a bit of campaign before the control scheme change
[3:02:01] <@Menitta> can you fly to the boost past the first one
[3:02:04] <Azelstahn> oh then that explains it
[3:02:05] <TigerClaws12> but yea they need that tutorial LUL

[3:30:34] <rcand9> real dangerous
[3:30:40] <%HRDSalami654> Rally is for people who are insane.
[3:30:52] <%Hammerknife> if driving rally is anything like autox then it's gotta be super fun
[3:31:09] <%Gamefriendly> Give it up for Group B rally, the hypest shit there is
[3:31:13] <%HRDSalami654> "Hey, let's drive at 60mph along a narrow dirt road with no traction!"
[3:31:29] <rcand9> double last
[3:31:37] <%Hammerknife> the lack of traction makes it more fun tbh
[3:31:47] <%HRDSalami654> Yes.
[3:31:56] <%HRDSalami654> By insane, I didn't mean it wasn't fun.
[3:32:02] <%Gamefriendly> 60mph? more like 80+

[3:51:52] <%Hammerknife> yeah no its a dnd campaign
[3:51:57] <rcand9> so the box was like 1 whole pat?
[3:51:57] <Jigokuro> It's basically a DnD game in a box

[3:53:21] <%RioGascar> WHAT ABOUT ACCELLERACERS
[3:53:30] <%RioGascar> Written by the REBOOT GUYS
[3:53:42] <@Solidus_113> Hot Wheels had good shows
[3:53:42] <%Hammerknife> although there is a gloomhaven video game. wish it had multiplayer but its so beta it hurts
[3:53:43] <am_omega> Yo the live action movie was kinda legit.
[3:54:12] <rcand9> they were wrong it was fun as hell
[3:54:27] <%RioGascar> I see no reason for gloomhaveen to be a video game
[3:54:40] <am_omega> Yo like my favorite youtube video is the final scene but with Initial D music. its hype
[3:54:47] <%RioGascar> its like making doom a boardgame
[3:54:51] <%RioGascar> and that was done
[3:54:53] <%RioGascar> it sucks
[3:55:06] <@Solidus_113> going 500 miles in a CIRCLE
[3:55:14] <rcand9> DAYTONA YEEEEE
[3:55:14] <Super_Voltekka> "They're making a left TUUUUUUUUURN!"
[3:55:16] <%Hammerknife> i could see a mobile version of gloomhaven being fairly fun
[3:55:40] <%Hammerknife> but yeah 90% of it is table banter and watching people get blown out
[3:55:47] <am_omega> Yo NASCAR is hype when you bet on the races.
[3:55:54] <%Knight_Anastasia> !uptime

[3:56:29] <@Solidus_113> Hot Wheels Highway 35 World Race but its Initial D
[3:56:40] <%RioGascar> that would be highway 35
[3:56:44] <am_omega> God it makes that movie super hype.
[3:56:55] <%RioGascar> Which accelleracers is the continuation
[3:56:57] <SuperKirby24> ITS SO GOOD
