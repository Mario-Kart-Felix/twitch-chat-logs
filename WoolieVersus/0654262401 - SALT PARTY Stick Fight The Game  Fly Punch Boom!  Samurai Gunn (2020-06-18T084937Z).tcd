[0:02:21] <ZeeJiggle> Is it?
[0:02:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> Minh having an offscreen pewdiepie moment monkaS
[0:02:22] <%ekodrop> muddy
[0:02:23] <+Vigonept> staticy?
[0:02:23] <CazadorDeWulf> Compression and Gain are off
[0:02:24] <BoneBagMel> a bit crackly? a bit rough?
[0:02:25] <prime_name> Sounds a bit muddy
[0:02:26] <Matrixvingian> The upper ranges are grating a touch.
[0:02:28] <+griffball13> sounds fine
[0:02:32] <BoneBagMel> aahhh thats
[0:02:32] <stealthfart> Sound
[0:02:33] <neraren> Youre a bit Tin-y
[0:02:34] <BoneBagMel> yeah thats ok
[0:02:36] <+egalitarian696969> NOTHIN
[0:02:36] <TomosukeUsagi> Oh neat
[0:02:37] <waterstealer> WOOLIE IS BACKGROUND NOISE
[0:02:37] <gamewarden92> no claps
[0:02:37] <BoneBagMel> yeah we don't
[0:02:37] <SGrim> It works
[0:02:38] <+Shinsasu> its okay, bit dull, but thats normal for the filter
[0:02:38] <%LynbellDaYo> that's working pretty well
[0:02:40] <CazadorDeWulf> Can't hear it nope
[0:02:40] <%CJett92> SIlent, yaya
[0:02:41] <%rosemaryplush> sounds ok
[0:02:41] <BoneBagMel> It's ok
[0:02:41] <Matrixvingian> Not bad with the anti clap I couldn't hear those cheeks.
[0:02:41] <+b_aleph> sounds LOW
[0:02:43] <%Klefth> Yeah, but your voice sounds off
[0:02:43] <ferretinatux> hewwo
[0:02:44] <arikk42> you sound like you are in a much smaller box
[0:02:45] <%Zayasu> KonCha
[0:02:48] <Leafboi125> I wonder what mihn said?
[0:02:48] <Visorak6> Yeah it does but it definitely deletes some of the voice range
[0:02:48] <BoneBagMel> You can get used to it, no worries.
[0:02:50] <generalve> im confused though, you barley had background noise to begin with ?
[0:02:53] <+griffball13> it's fiiiine
[0:02:54] <@Solidus_113> The tin is because it's silencing the claps
[0:02:55] <%CJett92> its not bad
[0:02:56] <CazadorDeWulf> No way?
[0:02:56] <+b_aleph> I wanna hear them big claps
[0:02:56] <Kalcom> filtered voice
[0:02:59] <+Vigonept> wanna try it with it off?
[0:03:00] <+MajorCrasher> it's because your mic sucks
[0:03:02] <Dingalow> I did not hear those claps, that's mental
[0:03:02] <@Solidus_113> the AI works, but it's never perfect
[0:03:04] <%Lion_kun> Ask pat about his audio settings
[0:03:06] <%ekodrop> for some reason it's worse for you than i've heard elsewhere
[0:03:06] <neraren> Youre still totally understandable
[0:03:09] <damascussteele> Iheard sound of one hand clapping
[0:03:12] <dinnydanny777> bugsnax
[0:03:14] <BoneBagMel> It's understandable
[0:03:14] <Matrixvingian> Is there high volume nature show activities bleeding in?
[0:03:15] <Kalcom> Minh voice is the same, how
[0:03:17] <%eyezehuhh> this is a good ass looking apartment
[0:03:17] <+bionic_hippo> doesn't sound bad, just different. cool that it blocks background noise
[0:03:22] <+Shinsasu> now your wive can cry in the background an we'll never know
[0:03:28] <neraren> Its supposed to get better the more you use it, it learns
[0:03:35] <gamewarden92> the talking sounds ok right now
[0:03:38] <BoneBagMel> Yeah we can understand u perfectly. No background noises is great. All good guys
[0:03:41] <%ekodrop> nah it still sounds muddy when you're talking normally
[0:03:41] <CazadorDeWulf> If you could turn overall volume up on your mics that would be perfect
[0:03:42] <Triplicat> RTX ON
[0:03:47] <BoneBagMel> maybe turn it up a tad
[0:03:47] <%CJett92> damn, I still think thats magic
[0:03:55] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> cool

[0:04:06] <Visorak6> Wait no it still sounds the same even with the filter off
[0:04:08] <%CJett92> Audio isnt bad, its fiiiiiiiiiine
[0:04:09] <+b_aleph> But how he gonna hear dem cheeks clapping???
[0:04:11] <neraren> Hold a note and then turn it on
[0:04:12] <+MajorCrasher> your mic is tinny with it off too
[0:04:13] <+tearfuldevil> @Helix_Snake nope
[0:04:15] <%LynbellDaYo> The audio sounds just fine with filter on

[0:04:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 20 minutes and 32 seconds
[0:04:21] <stealthfart> Mic sound needs to go up I’m at about 75% and you’re low
[0:04:21] <Thornbad> the tin's a bit... hard for me to listen to, but i got... auditory issues
[0:04:26] <CazadorDeWulf> Yep filter on is fine, the volume is just low af
[0:04:28] <%Klefth> The weirdness in the voice is still there when you turned it off. You kinda sound like the skeleton blacksmith in DS1
[0:04:29] <scrublord009> ITS FINE
[0:04:30] <@Solidus_113> the only problem right now is possibly losing laughs and some screaming with the AI
[0:04:30] <prime_name> There are just a few moments of wonky mic quality is all.
[0:04:32] <Kalcom> sounds weird without filter
[0:04:37] <BoneBagMel> It's ok

[0:05:28] <neraren> Punchmom is not human confirmed, she is entirely filtered out. She could be standing right in front of the camera right now for all we know
[0:05:35] <Kalcom> don't care bout background noise but do whatever is good
[0:05:37] <+MajorCrasher> it's definitely Woolie's mic. mihn sounds fine and the tin is still there when you turn it off
[0:05:44] <CazadorDeWulf> High-end Hz on equalizer needs to be turned down slightly

[0:06:53] <%ekodrop> could be
[0:06:56] <Kalcom> it's not the filter
[0:06:59] <dinnydanny777> Woolie's mic is a bit static sounding
[0:07:07] <Kalcom> he tried without it
[0:07:07] <+TreeeFOX> yes
[0:07:08] <BoneBagMel> Reggie, tap your mic
[0:07:11] <CazadorDeWulf> The tinny is not the filter, something wrong with Woolie's mic in particular
[0:07:11] <gamewarden92> talk more
[0:07:11] <%rosemaryplush> huh
[0:07:15] <neraren> Dont know if its the mic or the program just doesnt like his voice specifically

[0:07:57] <$Superdandy96> Woolie has poopie mic
[0:07:58] <Triplicat> woolie talking into one of the other two mics would be the scientific process
[0:08:06] <scrumbotime> Everyone sounds kinda low but Woolie's is low and sounds off too.
[0:08:23] <neraren> Talk into reggies mic to see if its te mic or you
[0:08:28] <BoneBagMel> Maybe it's the tone of voice it self, don't worry too much about it
[0:08:28] <%fist_wizard_jay> THIS
[0:08:29] <+b_aleph> @scrumbotime yeah, audio's low

[0:17:02] <Solidnick18> it's wild
[0:17:11] <+dream__center> based on current events
[0:17:18] <Dingalow> Chad is a good meme because it's specifically about people better than the person calling someone a chad
[0:17:20] <dinnydanny777> Have you seen the one with the woman yelling at a shop about Jesus
[0:17:20] <+dream__center> based on current Karens
[0:17:23] <Solidnick18> yes it was

[0:18:40] <+oda_flobunaga> MGS 5 and Duke Nukem 4ever
[0:18:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hype is silly.
[0:18:46] <+Ardisan_> A game taking too long to come out stopped boring me because I have so much games to play still.

[0:19:38] <+oda_flobunaga> Star Citizen?
[0:19:57] <+Ardisan_> SMT5 do far is probsbly the biggest offender for this.
[0:19:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Every job has deadlines. Meet them.
[0:20:00] <$Superdandy96> SMT5, I totally forgot about that. Kinda like Metroid Prime 4
[0:20:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Look, if the game is better for the wait then I'm willing to wait
[0:20:16] <BearSawed> Hahahahahah Star citizen, I havent heard that name in many years
[0:20:23] <+HollowMan190> And if it's no
[0:20:25] <Dingalow> Doesn't Platinum typically have a good work ethic?
[0:20:26] <+HollowMan190> not
[0:20:34] <Solidnick18> it wasn't promised
[0:20:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:46] <Prevot> the mario rabbids leak was the worst, the devs had a plan to convince people it was good nd some asshole just blew it all out
[0:20:46] <%fangovafang> have they played power rangers battle for the grid yet?
[0:20:51] <+jiggy_snipe> Miyamoto said
[0:20:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Star Citizen is still in Alpha after like 10 years of constant work
[0:20:53] <MyNameIsRasus> If you can't meet a deadline that you agreed to (assuming you had actual agency in setting that deadline) then you failed
[0:21:07] <$Superdandy96> So I can add Tekken x Street Fighter into the void... sigh. panicBasket
[0:21:08] <Finakala> Triple-I is a good title
[0:21:13] <+zooeymainbtw> haha star citizen and constant work
[0:21:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Indie games are constantly coming out, and there are some real gems out there
[0:21:21] <dinnydanny777> Are Indie games not the most common type of game at this point
[0:21:23] <FazzleRazzle> but shut up i want the thing that i wanted and i want it to be they way i expected
[0:21:23] <f4ntom98> Wow Triple I? That's a news to me
[0:21:29] <+oda_flobunaga> sorry, constant "development"
[0:21:29] <+pectusumbra> SMT V IS JUST REAL LIFE
[0:21:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Triple I is strong
[0:21:31] <BearSawed> Star citizen also has no money and screws workers if I remember correctly
[0:21:37] <Triplicat> DMCVSE
[0:21:43] <%ggbhtg> @fangovafang Back before the low block patch, soooo they really need to play Power Rangers Grid a 2nd time
[0:21:48] <Dingalow> Delays are a good sign to me. Metroid Prime 4, I'm glad to hear is getting more development time, that tells me they do not want to fuck this up

[1:20:08] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus btw, RTX acts really wierd whenever you all are loud (shouting, laughing, otherwise getting hype) at once
[1:20:11] <f4ntom98> That was a great game guys
[1:20:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, the RTX was funky.
[1:20:25] <f4ntom98> RTX kills pop OFFS
[1:20:30] <+nintega010> now fortune street
[1:20:32] <Solidnick18> alright next game FeelsGoodMan
[1:20:35] <rcand9> persona 4 on pc is great playing it atm
[1:20:38] <MrMediocrity> so my boy reggie clearly would win any game. Do you just let him have 5 mins at the end with your feet to let it go or what?
[1:20:43] <gamewarden92> Woolie's laugh is too pure for RTX. A human coud not make such a perfect sound.
[1:21:00] <prime_name> Whatcha typing Woolz?
[1:21:01] <+fizzguy47> Wha happun to Woolie's Gamercube?
[1:21:06] <%DSD24> Oh did I miss Stick Fight?
[1:21:08] <CorgiRiderCorki> Reggie says "hydrate, or die-drate!"
[1:21:13] <crossing_mao> RTX kicks little dogs
[1:21:22] <%Zayasu> yes its annoying
[1:21:29] <+YabbaTroll> yeah todays audio is weird
[1:21:30] <RunningNGunning> Yes its not good
[1:21:31] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[1:21:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah
[1:21:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:21:32] <Solidnick18> yes
[1:21:32] <prime_name> yep
[1:21:33] <Josef_Stryker> Yeah
[1:21:34] <@Solidus_113> RTX Voice is also fucking with the laughs and "oohhhh's"
[1:21:34] <CorgiRiderCorki> group consensus
[1:21:34] <+tearfuldevil> it kills the hype
[1:21:35] <gamewarden92> it's different
[1:21:36] <+dmtjinni> yub
[1:21:37] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It's turdy poo poo
[1:21:38] <Visorak6> It kills your hype
[1:21:38] <DedlokPM> yes it is a consensus
[1:21:39] <+jiggy_snipe> it was happening on Thursday too
[1:21:40] <+aishman> Yawp yawp
[1:21:40] <%BisoromiBear> it's a hype killer
[1:21:44] <%Javaa01> Yes it doesn't know how to handle the room echo
[1:21:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> There's something weird about it.
[1:21:46] <+nintega010> yeah. felt like it's cutting out other people
[1:21:48] <Hammatime8> Yea RTX is messing with stuff a bit
[1:21:49] <prime_name> Pop-Offs get muted
[1:21:52] <Solidnick18> i think it's not great i like hearing the rukus
[1:21:53] <+EldritchBee> Its like *pop off* OOOuuuhh~
[1:21:54] <+tearfuldevil> its not meant for thuggery
[1:21:59] <f4ntom98> RTX is a hype killer thats all not in a group
[1:22:03] <Solidnick18> it does it's job
[1:22:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearfuldevil ^
[1:22:05] <tattleworm> it's built with a single user in mind
[1:22:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Maybe it's too many people. If you were alone or something.
[1:22:09] <Solidnick18> yeah
[1:22:11] <+Kenidashi> RTX Audio works great w/ a single person. Not so hot when in a group environment.
[1:22:19] <+dmtjinni> not too bad imo tbh
[1:22:20] <black_pariah> maybe if mihn wasnt popping off every three seconds
[1:22:22] <gamewarden92> sometimes your laugh gets censored.
[1:22:24] <%GrassCannon> I've heard you all cut out multiple times
[1:22:26] <prime_name> It tries to dampen the sound way too much
[1:22:27] <RunningNGunning> Sounds like you're underwater or super quiet
[1:22:28] <f4ntom98> Yup, underwater quality
[1:22:29] <black_pariah> i kid
[1:22:31] <Josef_Stryker> Everytime u guys raise ur voice it quiets down
[1:22:32] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus A lot of the time it cuts off the audio when you guys go loud
[1:22:32] <+Kenidashi> It tries to isolate a single voice, and the more you talk the smarter it gets at doing that...for a single voice.
[1:22:33] <rainhatbellweather> Why is there a timer next to the viewer number?
[1:22:33] <@Solidus_113> The AI can't decide between cutting it out or keeping it, so it just turns to garbage
[1:22:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Underwater and muffled.
[1:22:35] <CorgiRiderCorki> it sounds super warped, or the audio just cuts out entirely
[1:22:38] <%Javaa01> It thinks *everything* in the room is noise it should be filtering out
[1:22:44] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus if one person is talking, and then the others are going "ooooh" or laughing, the others get dimmed/muted
[1:22:47] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus RTX Audio kills Max's Homer yells.
[1:22:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, it cut out laughs multiple times.
[1:22:48] <Solidnick18> yeah it just cancels out loud laughter
[1:23:12] <rainhatbellweather> Why is there a timer next to the viewer count in the corner?
[1:23:12] <+dmtjinni> insane
[1:23:18] <DedlokPM> minh kinda sounds off right now audio wise
[1:23:20] <%Klefth> Yeah, it'd be best if you can check it yourself, but it almost sounds like the sound of others gets compressed when someone is too loud
[1:23:30] <%Klefth> And Woolie sounds kinda staticky all the time
[1:23:32] <MrMediocrity> @WoolieVersus so my boy reggie clearly would win any game. Do you just let him have 5 mins at the end with your feet to let it go or what?
[1:23:33] <black_pariah> @atyerservice thats how the streams been running
[1:23:40] <+tearfuldevil> @atyerservice do you mean enxt to the viewers? thats stream runtime
[1:23:43] <+EldritchBee> @WoolieVersus Yeah, I suggest giving today's stream a listen to get the true experience
[1:23:45] <prime_name> Rip RTX
[1:23:47] <f4ntom98> We're sorry Woolz, but the experiment was worth it
[1:23:54] <gamewarden92> I think RTX could come back in the future
[1:23:55] <%Wool> RTX got canceled for the summer, and now they've canceled RTX
[1:23:57] <rainhatbellweather> Oh, I didn't notice it was going up @tearfuldevil
[1:23:59] <%SuperKirby24> rip in pepperoni
[1:23:59] <+EldritchBee> Now you know!
[1:24:01] <Ragnorok64> It's technically still in beta
[1:24:02] <Solidnick18> it's almost their
[1:24:03] <@Solidus_113> It's still technically in Beta, isn't it?
[1:24:03] <%GrassCannon> As TeamFourStar once said, "If you're over the age of 18 and haven't heard the word 'fuck' before... well, you have now"
[1:24:04] <Hammatime8> It was worth a shot :/
[1:24:05] <Solidnick18> i feel you
[1:24:06] <+nintega010> rtx is good for fighting games
[1:24:12] <%Klefth> Well, it's still in beta. It'll probably improve down the line

[1:35:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> ok dis hard
[1:35:14] <%DappercatEsquire> God this art style is offputting
[1:35:14] <+worldbrand> this is the best 2008 game ive ever seen
[1:35:19] <CorgiRiderCorki> very Power Rangers sounding
[1:35:30] <CorgiRiderCorki> MorphinTime MorphinTime
[1:35:34] <%BisoromiBear> press x to not die
[1:35:35] <+fizzguy47> this sounds like old Power Rangers music
[1:35:36] <%SuperKirby24> ESPECIALLY THAT GUITAR
[1:35:41] <%TheBensonator_> Are we sure this isn't just some long lost Newgrounds game?!
[1:35:49] <%LynbellDaYo> was that awesome face
[1:35:49] <%Plus_On_Black> I hate the art but it's hard tho.
[1:36:10] <Prevot> just give this a DBZ coat of paint
[1:36:16] <+jiggy_snipe> this art kinda fits the gameplay in a weird way
[1:36:25] <%SuperKirby24> can you mod this? Kappa
[1:36:26] <%Wool> everything goes hard but the art
[1:36:27] <+fizzguy47> Gameplay vs Graphics
[1:36:40] <%DappercatEsquire> It is Xbox Live Indie Games from the 360 era
[1:36:45] <masterfire23> this game needs mugen level mods
[1:36:45] <+DeaconBluesClues> I feel the flipside of "picking a character you think looks cool" is you lock youself out of shit with cool gameplay thatl ooks stupid
[1:36:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This music is real fun
[1:37:11] <Solidnick18> yea
[1:37:16] <%BisoromiBear> maybe he got the idea for the game while in a decade long coma
[1:37:31] <jellssssss20> hey chat, what do i need to know just comingin now?

[1:44:47] <%TheBensonator_> Anime: The Fighter: Dodging Copyright Edition: The QTE DLC...?
[1:44:50] <NekoZen> its just Bumper Cars
[1:44:51] <jellssssss20> So what happens when two people just time it perfectly always? is this just QTE the Practice Fighting Game?
[1:44:55] <%Plus_On_Black> This game became trash in five minutes.
[1:45:00] <+jiggy_snipe> seems like the fights go on too long
[1:45:01] <NekoZen> its fancy paper rock scissors bumper cars
[1:45:02] <+RealThiele> this is a 2009 flash game and im on Kongregate

[1:45:37] <%LTKonnor> All the real men used to be on Kongregate
[1:45:38] <Renkage> I'm just imagining this game with an shonen anime artstyle. And it is drastically improving the experience
[1:45:38] <%LynbellDaYo> oh my god, there are two rounds?
[1:45:40] <NekoZen> 1 round out of 2
[1:45:41] <xiccy> What the hell is happening? An I high?!
[1:45:44] <CorgiRiderCorki> it wants to be another Yomi teacher? life too long for that goal though

[1:59:45] <jellssssss20> @atyerservice I didn't know that, lnao
[1:59:50] <Leafboi125> One Piece :(
[1:59:52] <%JaseAdrift> Only watch one piece when you wanna see the cool fight moment
[1:59:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> One Piece more like One big piece of shit amirite boys

[2:00:07] <%kyh9> One Piece is the best of the Big Three
[2:00:12] <+Dorf1> the snake had a sharingan for a second
[2:00:14] <+Idziman> if one piece wasnt good it wouldnt be going on for 20+ years
[2:00:14] <rainhatbellweather> @jellssssss20 If someone could reverse engineer the servers, it might be active again.
[2:00:17] <+GenesisKnight> Does that snake have a sharingan
[2:00:20] <+NickHatesSnow> One Piece is popping off hard rn
[2:00:21] <+cdrom321> Why did they stop Stick Fight?
[2:00:22] <Leafboi125> ResidentSleeper
[2:00:26] <+RealThiele> gork sez stop
[2:00:29] <%kyh9> One Piece wins the Weekly Shonen Jump contest by value of not having shit the bed horribly yet
[2:00:30] <BearSawed> one piece is the most consistent of the old big 3
[2:00:32] <+Itselguapo> Oh so you weren't even at that good shit yet.
[2:00:43] <Mr_Rakjo> Stick fight doesnt have a stop point @cdrom321
[2:00:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kyh9 For how long it's been going, that's a feat.
[2:00:58] <Prevot> motherfuckers out here reading berserk which probably wont even end and one piece is too long LUL
[2:01:00] <%JaseAdrift> you watch One Piece for the adventure not the ending.
[2:01:01] <+tearfuldevil> @BearSawed i mean the "old big 3" is only a thing in NA
[2:01:02] <+cdrom321> @Mr_Rakjo Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part.
[2:01:07] <CorgiRiderCorki> one piece wins by doing absolutely nothing
[2:01:11] <+jetjagger222> anyone else get a bit nauseated on how this looks and animates
[2:01:13] <+RealThiele> captain planet WINS
[2:01:19] <+fetrigon> @jase__x exactly
[2:01:41] <+Dova573> tbf One piece will probaly end in next five years, Probaly
[2:01:44] <Leafboi125> It do
[2:01:51] <+GenesisKnight> I think that snake has a mangekyo
[2:01:52] <%kyh9> Yeah, behind the helmet is asharingan
[2:01:54] <+tearfuldevil> there was huuuuuge power gap in sales and popularity between nart, bleahc, and one piece in japan, basically from the begininng
[2:01:55] <+Itselguapo> I don't know about this game, Active reload, and mashing while flying around in circles is pretty much the entire game.
[2:01:58] <+Dova573> But for sure we are on the last parts of the story
[2:02:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont care how bored quarantine makes me. I'm never reading WanPiss and that's a fact. woolieLORE

[2:02:24] <+nintega010> @fuqboislim it's ok to be wrong
[2:02:26] <+Thatghostpepper> if you can stomach dynasty clones but want to catch up to one piece, try the pirate warriors series
[2:02:29] <+RealThiele> with some cleaning this could be divekick levels good
[2:02:32] <+tearfuldevil> @FuqBoiSlim good for you, nobody cares
[2:02:37] <+Itselguapo> Pirate warriors 3 is good shit
[2:02:43] <+Itselguapo> 4th one is okay.

[2:07:46] <Leafboi125> hidden gem. Evo when?
[2:07:47] <majindusto> Woolie trying to Deny us THE LORE
[2:07:49] <+jetjagger222> @FuqBoiSlim my thoughts exactly
[2:07:53] <jellssssss20> Have you read Irredeemable/Incorruptible @WoolieVersus ?any thoughts?
[2:08:16] <rainhatbellweather> We need some lore, DANGIT!
[2:08:17] <Renkage> Shonen Anime version of this game
[2:08:23] <+jetjagger222> the potential is there but the tone is just super ironic/hipstery
[2:08:27] <+RealThiele> If only we knew the redeeming lore
[2:08:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Give it to Bandai Namco
[2:08:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> woolieLORE Anti-boomer Woolie hating on LORE woolieLORE woolieLORE
[2:08:43] <hattrick61> FPB is the new KI
[2:08:44] <CorgiRiderCorki> too far into the "ironic" zone
[2:08:49] <+jetjagger222> if they did a tech romancer-esque affectionate parody it would be awesome
[2:08:59] <%redrins> but do you make baby jagos from fighting other ki characters? thought so
[2:09:01] <Solidnick18> that's so old
[2:09:05] <hattrick61> Whens the Minion getting added?
[2:09:06] <tattleworm> woolie's such a derpina
[2:09:09] <+RealThiele> memes age so quickly these days
[2:09:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont think it's ironic. the creator is just 10 years behind
[2:09:12] <+jetjagger222> or maybe i'm just being a boomer
[2:09:15] <Solidnick18> doge
[2:09:23] <+jiggy_snipe> memes die as fast as they are born now
[2:09:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> My dad has a Honey Badger Don't Give a Fuck shirt he still wears.
[2:09:28] <%DappercatEsquire> don't bet on memes if you want people to give a shit
[2:09:28] <CorgiRiderCorki> Minh is the best derpette
[2:09:28] <+worldbrand> We recently had a thread on the sub about bringing back dead memes to trick 2020 into thinking it was a different year
[2:09:36] <eldragon_1> Bad Luck Bryan
[2:09:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Minh has surpassed your weak memes
[2:09:42] <+RealThiele> Coffin dance meme is my new fav
[2:09:47] <rainhatbellweather> ^
[2:09:54] <jellssssss20> Have you ever played through the metal gear solid games (3 specifically tbh lol) on stream, any chance that you would?
[2:09:57] <Solidnick18> woah hey now
[2:10:07] <majindusto> WOOLIE, You were Supposed to Support the Lore...Not Deny us It!!!!
[2:10:10] <jellssssss20> He can't show his browser history Minh, chilllllllllllllll
[2:10:11] <tattleworm> nobody has ever been to 9gag, it exists solely in the hearts of your non-internet facebook friends
[2:10:11] <Prevot> woolies history is all dark skinned tomboys
[2:10:19] <CorgiRiderCorki> I like the datboi memes OSFrog
[2:10:24] <+jetjagger222> even weeb memes don't age well; haruhi and lucky star are super dead now
[2:10:34] <+RealThiele> woolie hiding his ganguro girl browser window
[2:10:51] <+worldbrand> then ytmnd had its proto-memes that it internally called fads
[2:10:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> I still think coldsteel the hegdeheg is still funny
[2:11:00] <%Clundy> Anyone ever play Roof Rage?

[2:11:31] <%XxPatchworkxX> Kojima made memes
[2:11:35] <masterfire23> meme history time
[2:11:36] <SomersaultJustice> HISTORY OF MEMES
[2:11:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> In the book Selfish Gene
[2:11:40] <+tearfuldevil> meme, or memetic mutations, has been a thing in the 80s
[2:11:40] <+jiggy_snipe> memes are genes for culture
[2:11:40] <+RealThiele> Genius Kojumbo
[2:11:43] <huskarl_zap> MEME is from antquity
[2:11:44] <Leafboi125> coldsteel is funny as fuck to me
[2:11:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> *The Selfish Gene
[2:11:46] <hattrick61> DNA OF THE SOUL
[2:11:46] <%BisoromiBear> the DNA of the ass
[2:11:47] <+worldbrand> memes were just forum image macros at first, but i hadn't heard it used prior to... 2002, i'd say
[2:11:48] <+Itselguapo> Meme is something that is a reference to our culture?
[2:11:49] <Shade075> DNA OF THE SOUL
[2:11:54] <+Itselguapo> if I remember correctly
[2:11:59] <Prevot> the memes jack
[2:12:01] <+jetjagger222> the theme song of pop team epic is literally about memes
[2:12:01] <Lee_The_Limey> THE MEMES , JACK
[2:12:01] <tattleworm> meme gained popularity as a term around when people started using impact font in images
[2:12:02] <Pappajimbo> richard dawkins
[2:12:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> Wasnt it Richard Dawkins who coined Memes?
[2:12:05] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> uptime!
[2:12:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Etymology is complicated
[2:12:10] <Leafboi125> SHOW ME THE MEMES
[2:12:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it was Dawkins
[2:12:12] <%emperordread> Meme was Richard Dawkins. It was to describe ideas being passed down similar to how genes get passed down
[2:12:14] <ZippyPsycho> Wipe this meme from the face of the earth
[2:12:18] <CorgiRiderCorki> Impact Font laid over jpeg and color background are when I think "meme" started to become a household word

[3:12:41] <%LynbellDaYo> they have missed it entirely
[3:12:48] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus stance switching changes the angle of ur attack
[3:12:49] <MyNameIsRasus> It is a thing
[3:12:54] <bevyrage> Stance switching changes if your sword comes out from overhead or underhand, which changes if you have an advantage if they're above or below you
[3:12:55] <CorgiRiderCorki> it is stance switch
[3:13:28] <%LynbellDaYo> So what's the point
[3:13:31] <segychan> this level fucking slaps
[3:13:34] <CorgiRiderCorki> ^
[3:13:40] <Arek_1> Overcut and undercut.
[3:13:42] <%DSD24> Rain makes a lot of things cooler
[3:13:43] <bevyrage> if you swing from overhand someone above you gets hits sooner than if you swung underhand
[3:13:51] <%LynbellDaYo> oh i see, cool
[3:13:52] <bevyrage> underhand hits someone below you faster than overhand
[3:13:59] <CursedNobleman> invisigun is harder LUL

[3:26:47] <glass_marcus> Bloody Palace Co-op
[3:27:07] <Renkage> @WoolieVersus Do you know about Crab Fight. If yes, do you have any interest in playing it. It's seriously stupid amounts of fun
[3:27:23] <alephalpha> crab fight time?
[3:27:25] <CorgiRiderCorki> mystery partner
[3:28:17] <hunter31626> monkaS
[3:28:44] <CorgiRiderCorki> nominate House on Haunted Hill for tablelords 💕
[3:28:46] <Renkage> Not gonna spam that to much. I am just a little bit to excited about Fight Crab. I'ma FIght Crab preacher, informing everyone about the majesty of that game
[3:28:58] <+zepelinnn1> ewww sf
[3:29:11] <Arek_1> Man, I do NOT want the next Capcom fighting game to be Street Fighter.
[3:29:37] <bevyrage> same arek, same
[3:29:38] <+Ardisan_> Hope sf6 is more defensive and goes for a less semi realistic art style
[3:30:02] <%jinking79> i don't want sf6 to soon right now
[3:30:05] <CorgiRiderCorki> @legacy0117 bye friend 💕
[3:30:16] <Arek_1> Give me Capcom vs. Capcom.
[3:30:30] <Djinnazz> That's Mech Warriors
[3:30:30] <%LynbellDaYo> motion sickness hell for me
[3:30:52] <Renkage> You want that one TERRIBLE kinect game where you control a mech. But in VR. And good
[3:31:09] <+yoshiunity> I'm down for Capcom vs. Capcom.
[3:31:14] <+Ardisan_> not happening but what if Capcom made the skullgirls team work on a Darkstalkers game
[3:31:16] <Kei_Ar_> is this pre game or post game talk
[3:31:23] <%haisho> yeah bunny hopping in games that allow them can get crazy
[3:31:23] <CorgiRiderCorki> postgame
[3:31:25] <alephalpha> I remember tribes
[3:31:43] <DragonArt07> warframe is pretty fast especially if your using volt or one of the newest frames
[3:31:51] <alephalpha> vr kills me even when there's mo movement
[3:31:52] <masterfire23> titanfall is one of the fastest fps so much fun
[3:32:03] <alephalpha> titanfall is idneed super fun
[3:32:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:32:15] <alephalpha> I couldn't care for sf6 though
[3:32:20] <CorgiRiderCorki> tribes ascend still has a dedicated fanbase, I believe
[3:32:31] <alephalpha> I just wnat my anime airdashers to stay complex and wild
[3:32:35] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Maybe SF6 will go back to delay netcode, after all the hate capcom has seen for SFV's netcode Kappa
[3:32:36] <Arek_1> Proximity normals has to return.
[3:32:41] <bevyrage> unless sf6 does third strike and tries something new, unlike... pushing the same old tired bs
[3:32:47] <Arek_1> Yeyeye.
[3:32:52] <Renkage> Capcom All-Stars
[3:32:54] <drefizz> ASURA
[3:32:57] <alephalpha> I would take more darkstalkers
[3:33:01] <%LynbellDaYo> Capcom All-Stars would be a godsend
[3:33:01] <JetpackMcQuack> GivePLZ
[3:33:07] <%haisho> I would have said All-Stars but that exists and...it's not stellar
[3:33:09] <Prevot> only if its ACTUALLY called capcom vs capcom
[3:33:22] <alephalpha> like screw capcom vs capcom just give me darkstalkers
[3:33:22] <+Ardisan_> I want anither Strider Metrodvania game
[3:33:28] <CorgiRiderCorki> darkstarkers DarkMode
[3:33:33] <Renkage> Ehhhhh. Is there enough of a moveset per weapon?
[3:33:44] <+worldbrand> what about capcom vs
[3:34:11] <%vaporousTippler> You can't end a title in vs.
[3:34:16] <+jiggy_snipe> or vs capcom
[3:34:17] <alephalpha> I want my aniem airdahsers mihn
[3:34:19] <glass_marcus> CAPCOM VS CAPCPOM
[3:34:41] <Arek_1> Nah, grounded fighters are a snooze fest lately. Gotta go hyper fighter.

[3:34:54] <SheefEatsBeef> capcom vs comcap
[3:34:57] <alephalpha> CAPCOM VS ARCYS WHEN
[3:35:05] <CorgiRiderCorki> Capcom vs capcapom
[3:35:11] <Leafboi125> mat did a video on that game today
[3:35:14] <Renkage> They announce a Capcom vs Capcom game. Turns it into Smash Brothers Kappa
[3:35:16] <+Ardisan_> Tbh dont play MvC for the Marvel characters. I play it to enjoy the characters capcom doesnt give enough love
[3:35:28] <alephalpha> ^
[3:35:34] <+jiggy_snipe> Nintendo vs. Capcom
[3:35:41] <%haisho> probably Bandai-Namco?
[3:35:49] <%LynbellDaYo> it's called smash
[3:35:49] <+balouie> square has a lot of ips they just sit on
[3:36:15] <+SWindleFeD> I come in to 420 viewers and then I see it drop to 412 as I'm typing this shotoStare
[3:36:21] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't think you can include the anime stuff
[3:36:23] <SomersaultJustice> would nintendo get popeye in that case?
[3:36:32] <+yoshiunity> Capgod vs. Crapcom
[3:36:34] <+SWindleFeD> Who are the people that left and ruined the meme number?!
[3:36:35] <CorgiRiderCorki> @swindlefed they are about to sign off is why
[3:36:44] <+SWindleFeD> Damn it
[3:36:58] <+TenguGemini> or ALL OF GUNDAM
[3:37:02] <prime_name> Are we talking just video games or all rights?
[3:37:14] <Renkage> @WoolieVersus Do you know about Fight Crab. If yes, do you have any interest in playing it. It's seriously stupid amounts of fun.
[3:37:16] <+jiggy_snipe> it'll be Tekken, SC and Kos-Mos
[3:37:27] <JetpackMcQuack> What about dig dug man
[3:37:32] <+Ardisan_> Nintendo has a great roster
[3:37:37] <+TenguGemini> SNK too
[3:37:41] <CorgiRiderCorki> rip fight crab ):
[3:37:47] <Arek_1> When I think Bandai Namco, I don't think of their anime licenses. They're all just yearly anime arena fighters.
[3:37:51] <+SWindleFeD> Something newly old?
[3:37:53] <%LynbellDaYo> sick
[3:37:54] <Prevot> PogChamp
[3:38:03] <%TheBensonator_> YEYEYE
[3:38:08] <theanora1> It's Sonic
[3:38:08] <+jiggy_snipe> the anime stuff shouldn't count because those are licenses so they don't own them
