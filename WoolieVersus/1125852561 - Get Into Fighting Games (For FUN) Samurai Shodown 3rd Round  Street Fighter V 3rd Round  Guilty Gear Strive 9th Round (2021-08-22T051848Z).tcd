[0:09:11] <+TopTieramisu> the dagger vs the (bai)ken
[0:09:28] <Applecannon63> LETTING HER DRILL PIERCE HEAVEN's FLOOR!
[0:09:29] <%Kato__v> Baiken translated surprisingly well in SS7

[0:18:32] <+chief_chongo> @TopTieramisu doodLewd doodLewd doodLewd
[0:18:34] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu There is a channel that keeps doing that
[0:18:35] <%FoxLex_> And then Covid happen
[0:18:39] <Applecannon63> doesn't he have the crouch?
[0:18:42] <darkelfdebauchery> Hey why did someone pick Warden as a crossover character?
[0:18:48] <Applecannon63> from Xrd
[0:18:54] <%mr_sups> Shout out to Ronin Rumble and Geoff the Hero
[0:18:55] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[0:18:55] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[0:19:04] <%FoxLex_> Teleports
[0:19:06] <+TopTieramisu> wtf. i don't even know about this bunny girl
[0:19:14] <+TopTieramisu> i must have missed a few dlc
[0:19:14] <%FoxLex_> That's all you need to know about GSL
[0:19:18] <%jinking79> 3 guest characters only one of them matter
[0:19:18] <Applecannon63> GACHA waifu
[0:19:19] <+thedream_c> Oh the Bacon release
[0:19:20] <+chief_chongo> oh warden, thats not the guy you fight on the bridge in sekiro??
[0:19:21] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu She's from SNK's parent company mobile game
[0:19:24] <darkelfdebauchery> makes no sense
[0:19:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> the last time i touched this was Warden
[0:19:25] <+chief_chongo> ROBERRRRTTTTTTT
[0:19:31] <+thedream_c> yep they had that collab
[0:19:31] <leith_aziz> The Warden is so weird here
[0:19:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> i played like 20+ games with hbjohn on twitter
[0:19:46] <armchairmaster_> Shoulder bash forever
[0:19:48] <%townzzzzz> WALK THE WALK
[0:19:59] <WakeUpThrow> I actually feel like the Warden fits like a glove in here
[0:20:02] <darkelfdebauchery> there is just a cooler version of warden that is IN For Honour
[0:20:06] <Applecannon63> Warden is honestly fitting but wish they picked a better faction
[0:20:07] <%jepupu> All you twitter husbandos better buy SamSho now
[0:20:13] <+heyitsdenzel_> walk forward
[0:20:18] <leith_aziz> The gun is the only move missing I think
[0:20:26] <leith_aziz> Also the parry super
[0:20:27] <darkelfdebauchery> They could have picked Apollyon who has any character
[0:20:29] <Applecannon63> Her Ashigatana
[0:20:33] <%Kato__v> Yashagatana gone
[0:20:38] <WakeUpThrow> I can't believe they brought the dunk back
[0:20:39] <+cubbywolf> they have a samurai clan in fh though
[0:21:04] <%jinking79> got those input on point
[0:21:15] <leith_aziz> cancel window II guess you mean?
[0:21:25] <iacus_> what does TK mean?
[0:21:27] <Applecannon63> Her FANCY SLASH FAN
[0:21:28] <+thedream_c> aaahh
[0:21:30] <+thedream_c> Tiger Knee
[0:21:32] <leith_aziz> @iacus_ Tiger Kneww
[0:21:37] <leith_aziz> *Knee
[0:21:39] <Applecannon63> TIGER Knee
[0:21:53] <Applecannon63> !glossary
[0:22:11] <+thedream_c> so if there is a 236 motion, if you hit 2369 and the move is air OK, you can get it off
[0:22:16] <+thedream_c> as low off the air if you can
[0:22:20] <Applecannon63> damn there should be a fighting game glossary command
[0:22:26] <toahmes> I didn't even notice tiny Reggie until he said something
[0:22:36] <+thedream_c> unless this channel uses infilaments glossary
[0:22:39] <%pupil31> Oh shit I noticed that LUL
[0:22:39] <%Sparkseid> S T R U T
[0:22:40] <%MutedMimic> sugoiGuts
[0:22:41] <iacus_> that swagger
[0:22:43] <+ManOfReason> Smol reggie
[0:22:49] <leith_aziz> The Exaggerated Swagger of a pissed off Samurai
[0:22:49] <%pupil31> He's in the middle LUL
[0:23:03] <leith_aziz> That parry is so badass
[0:23:06] <+thedream_c> i mean she's a master
[0:23:07] <Shad0wTag> I LOVE that alternate colour for Baiken it's like full blown Gyaru colour
[0:23:07] <Applecannon63> TATAMI GAESHI~
[0:23:08] <%townzzzzz> with the good hand
[0:23:09] <+TopTieramisu> she's got calloused hands
[0:23:11] <+TopTieramisu> hand*
[0:23:12] <+thedream_c> GOD HAND
[0:23:19] <Applecannon63> ONE HAND STYLE
[0:23:24] <+thedream_c> if I can ever do that, I can be hermit the rest of my life
[0:23:24] <+TopTieramisu> the fingers grab
[0:23:26] <Applecannon63> its badass tho
[0:23:31] <%jinking79> been fighting gears blade means nothing
[0:23:36] <%FoxLex_> I mean Suija uses his index finger
[0:23:37] <leith_aziz> A small nitpick is that it could have made more sense if she used Ki
[0:23:44] <leith_aziz> (to reflect)
[0:23:59] <+TopTieramisu> or she could have reflected with her claw somehow
[0:24:08] <Applecannon63> yeah why isn't she using her ki Samsho is no stranger to magic
[0:24:12] <+TopTieramisu> deflected*
[0:24:22] <%jinking79> landing this online is painful
[0:24:23] <+thedream_c> y'all trying to inject logic where her counter move is a frikin Tatami
[0:24:29] <+thedream_c> outta nbowhere
[0:24:34] <leith_aziz> @Applecannon63 Baiken doesn't rely on Ki too much in her fighting style. She only uses it in her Dust launcher
[0:24:40] <+TopTieramisu> she keeps her tatamis in her hair
[0:24:42] <Applecannon63> @thedream_c Ki/Magic
[0:24:54] <%FoxLex_> Not Issen, SMMs, or WFTs
[0:24:57] <%Kato__v> Suzuran still gets clipped by lows
[0:25:12] <leith_aziz> The Rev 2 2H

[0:25:35] <%Kato__v> Love to see it
[0:25:47] <Applecannon63> her parry is easy
[0:25:54] <leith_aziz> Can 6H > Run special > DP still work?
[0:27:32] <%notsoy> who's the guest
[0:27:38] <%FoxLex_> Can't punish lights to an extent
[0:27:46] <WakeUpThrow> LordJimmyBones
[0:27:50] <Applecannon63> I do wish her other super had the background being cut than just the opponent
[0:28:13] <TigerClaws12> smol reggie
[0:28:28] <%jepupu> Baiken's instant kill as a super animation would be cool, yeah
[0:28:31] <Applecannon63> I'm spoiled by her Xrd's Garyo Tensei
[0:29:33] <Applecannon63> at least her WFT looks cool
[0:29:53] <leith_aziz> Withh Tatami, you either spam it midscreen, or you use it defensively with a backjump
[0:30:04] <leith_aziz> Dont know if it works as well in this game though
[0:30:35] <leith_aziz> That super seems to spell out: "Heaven, Earth, Man"
[0:30:35] <Applecannon63> apparently Haomaru is her rival but not Darli?
[0:30:45] <+TopTieramisu> LUL

[0:33:00] <leith_aziz> I feel like I've dealt with worse
[0:33:23] <Applecannon63> She has marth tips
[0:33:27] <Shad0wTag> Even in another franchise, Daisuke's Vision prevails
[0:33:30] <Applecannon63> from her sword
[0:34:41] <leith_aziz> Baiken's Jump H in Rev 2 is so good in that you can't grab her no matter how early she does it

[0:55:11] <%Kato__v> @xmasterkeef420bluntninjax Likewise.
[0:56:23] <+TopTieramisu> it's sad that this will never get rollback
[0:56:41] <Applecannon63> it could only if Snk has the budget to
[0:56:45] <+TopTieramisu> since we don't know if there'll ever be another samsho
[0:57:15] <Applecannon63> realized that snk is in recovering from bankruptcy
[0:57:32] <MasterTonberry23> they went bankrupt again/

[1:13:48] <+TopTieramisu> the dude was my favorite design in GG
[1:14:04] <Saltmeisterr> i hope Bedwoman gets added lol
[1:14:10] <Shad0wTag> @TopTieramisu Considering hwo Daisuke mentioned how bummed he was to not include Venom in Strive probably not
[1:14:14] <Applecannon63> Venom will come back but he has Robo Ky as an assist
[1:14:19] <Wobuzhidao> Venom got his happy ending so probably not for a while
[1:14:21] <tolloponik> @TopTieramisu too busy making that bread with robo ky

[2:13:52] <%WeijiBeng> caring about matchup jonzheKEKW
[2:13:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> 60-64 is the limit imo
[2:13:59] <Hydrapissed> I mean infinite had a good idea
[2:14:12] <@Solidus_113> you can have a larger roster with smaller health bars. the match length would better determine it
[2:14:27] <%jepupu> Just make half the roster Goku so it doesn't feel as big. Works for DBFZ.
[2:14:37] <ElPlasa> It also depends on the type of game, a game made of constant knowledge checks like Tekken is really hard to keep on with a large roster
[2:14:44] <+Bearded_mushrum> SAM SHO SAM SHO
[2:15:21] <+Bearded_mushrum> i want lord jimmy bones glasses
[2:15:38] <Demoli_PT> they are in the 80s i think

[2:15:59] <Afrosamasenpai> Killers. Killers everywhere.
[2:15:59] <%he1lhydra> the celestial challenge is super hard

[2:16:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> not even to win, just to ruin your night
[2:16:37] <%justmildlilac> So to beat the Killers, I must become one myself...how boy.
[2:16:40] <NotHereToStream> i got goldlewis to celestial twice
[2:16:47] <Demoli_PT> rage quitting is whatever, you still get the win

[2:23:11] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[2:23:19] <President_valentine> His gameplay looks fine
[2:23:21] <%justmildlilac> Cool moves, terrible character design
[2:23:23] <%Josef_Stryker> Hell yeah!
[2:23:23] <+TopTieramisu> luke looks boring
[2:23:26] <+TopTieramisu> visually
[2:23:26] <President_valentine> his design is shit
[2:23:26] <DSD24> Its Captain Commando
[2:23:30] <%Josef_Stryker> Pat can go fuck himself!
[2:23:31] <+TopTieramisu> but his gameplay looks good
[2:23:34] <%WeijiBeng> why people dislike luke ? some guy done a video again ResidentSleeper
[2:23:39] <Saltmeisterr> he looks like shit
[2:23:39] <Applecannon63> Luke is cool but hope his design glows up in Sf6
[2:23:47] <%jinking79> don't like his V Chest tatoo but everything else good
[2:23:50] <+TopTieramisu> also, the popeye arms

[2:24:12] <+Jiggisnipe> that's Japan for you
[2:24:13] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[2:24:15] <Applecannon63> I'm just tired of Karate guy designs
[2:24:15] <@Solidus_113> blue and yellow capcom clothes
[2:24:19] <@Solidus_113> and they're mostly lame
[2:24:32] <Saltmeisterr> I HATE HIS FACE
[2:24:34] <+TopTieramisu> if they brought in a baki-type character, i'd be hype
[2:24:39] <+megamanx74> I would like a blue care yellow eye's character.
[2:24:40] <Saltmeisterr> THAT MY ONLY ISSUE
[2:24:40] <+TopTieramisu> his fighting style is not baki-like

[2:25:06] <President_valentine> I want Akira to return in SF6
[2:25:10] <Applecannon63> his hairstyle is okay but fuck his star shaves
[2:25:11] <%jepupu> They should’ve made him Swedish and it would have been fine for the colors.

[2:31:55] <Applecannon63> still a wierd input
[2:32:32] <artoflec> well i think we didnt get DMC1 dante for a LONG time but then he got used like 3 - 4 times in a row
[2:33:05] <Applecannon63> Rip ORO's nuts
[2:33:08] <+TopTieramisu> i would love to see nero in a fighting game
[2:33:10] <artoflec> like monster hunter world is i think the first time we ever got DMC1 Dante?? that cant be right can it?
[2:33:18] <@Solidus_113> DMC1 dante is used in every MH crossover
[2:33:18] <%he1lhydra> the FAT app has been super convenient for me in strive just to have frame data on my phone
[2:33:19] <Saltmeisterr> INCOMING BANGER
[2:33:24] <Shad0wTag> @artoflec DMC1 Dante is used in every crossover Capcom most of the time
[2:33:24] <%Sparkseid> sajamJam sajamJam sajamJam
[2:33:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> maaaan, charge characters
[2:33:26] <+Mrbaconator> holdin a TURT
[2:33:36] <@Solidus_113> DMC1 dante is the Mii fighter design
[2:33:37] <artoflec> i always thought it was DMC3 Dante artofl1Hm
[2:33:40] <Applecannon63> Charge character with covered balls
[2:33:41] <%jinking79> no nut sack with Cr.Mk
[2:33:47] <Applecannon63> sadgr
[2:33:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1427490836829417483?s=19
[2:33:50] <%Zero_Jacks> Protect Turtle
[2:33:52] <%justmildlilac> Oro's theme in this game is so chill, I love it
[2:33:53] <+Arek_1> Oro's actually a hybrid character like Chun-Li.
[2:34:00] <Valentine_Evelyn> yo his theme
[2:34:09] <artoflec> lol right yeah they used DMC1 for the mii design too, so it was SFV, monster hunter and smash kind of back to back.
[2:34:12] <+waltzqueen> is this For Fun or For Glory?
[2:34:21] <Applecannon63> @arek_1 Oro is the original chicken character
[2:34:22] <%TheTimelordPan> For SCIENCE!
[2:34:25] <+TopTieramisu> probably for fun
[2:34:28] <+Mrbaconator> conspiracy theory oro is dead and the turtle is puppeting his corpse like cordeceps
[2:34:52] <+waltzqueen> sounds legit
[2:34:53] <Applecannon63> Oro is immortal so he is dead inside
[2:34:57] <artoflec> oh DMC1 dante was in Project X Zone, but then i think X zone 2 is DMC3 dante
[2:35:02] <%kewlmyc> No more handing dong
[2:35:07] <+TopTieramisu> @Mrbaconator i guess the turtle learned invisibility by sf3
[2:35:07] <%justmildlilac> @mrbaconator 5 takes place before 3 so that doesn't work sadly
[2:35:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie focusing on what he's really wanting, them big oro balls
[2:35:12] <+Arek_1> THAT wasn't rope...
[2:35:22] <Applecannon63> yeah…rope
[2:35:28] <+RowenCleric> sure... rope...

[2:35:40] <+waltzqueen> mini reggie! So tiny
[2:35:44] <+Mrbaconator> listen i can work with this the turtle is using something like the dark hado to control him at range
[2:35:55] <Applecannon63> ORO just needs his Lakers Color
[2:36:15] <@Solidus_113> it's just Oro learning to fight one-handed
[2:36:17] <+Mrbaconator> why is oro making putty noises from power rangers
[2:36:23] <Man_in_the_Red> someone learnin their chicken combos
[2:36:27] <Applecannon63> @mrbaconator I mean to be fair Oro can satsui no hadou
[2:36:32] <DSD24> Or he's loving it
[2:36:45] <Applecannon63> Turtle just vibing
[2:37:08] <+Mrbaconator> i love that oro is so bored by fighting with both arms cuz it's too easy
[2:37:13] <+Mrbaconator> mans fuckin feelin himself
[2:37:16] <+TopTieramisu> is it just me or does that new kick move not feel very oro?
[2:37:40] <+TopTieramisu> not that i mind it much
[2:37:41] <Saltmeisterr> Ya h o o
[2:38:03] <%Sparkseid> dash in
[2:38:24] <%Zero_Jacks> turtle Shmovign
[2:38:27] <+waltzqueen> YAHOO! It's a-me! MariORO!
[2:38:28] <artoflec> so is oro like canonically the most powerful street fighter
[2:38:41] <+TopTieramisu> i think he is. but i'm not an expert on sf lore
[2:38:52] <Applecannon63> @toptieramisu I mean his ex ver. with flip should've been a standard
[2:39:05] <+Mrbaconator> i thought akuma or ryu with dark hado is stronger? but he's like up there
[2:39:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> BOOOOOOO
[2:39:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> ABIGIAL GOT ME BACK IN
[2:39:14] <Man_in_the_Red> Akuma lost to a sick old man
[2:39:14] <investorscratchit> Oro fought Akuma to a stand still
[2:39:17] <@Solidus_113> But Reggie, Abigail is Canadian
[2:39:22] <%Josef_Stryker> I'm just sad that Abigail is our Canadian Rep
[2:39:25] <Man_in_the_Red> thats not a high bar
[2:39:26] <@Solidus_113> he even has a maple leaf haircut
[2:39:27] <+TopTieramisu> yeah, akuma isn't stronger than oro
[2:39:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> abgiail represents canada
[2:39:36] <Man_in_the_Red> no i mean Gen
[2:39:38] <+TopTieramisu> and i doubt evil ryu is as strong as akuma
[2:39:47] <%Sparkseid> yeah season 5 made me excited for sfv again
[2:39:51] <+thedream_c> Abigail was kinda fun around S3. When he was buffed and braindead and making people weep in tourneys
[2:39:58] <+breakersnap> he fulfills my dream to beat the shit outta people with a turtle
[2:40:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> he wasn't even braindead
[2:40:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, he's been good but never broke as fuck
[2:40:23] <Applecannon63> @artoflec I mean he is on toe with Akuma in terms of strength but they stopped their fight cause both would die by a draw
[2:40:41] <+thedream_c> he was close in one of the the start of the seasons
[2:40:55] <+waltzqueen> i hope the next character is a mad old lady who looks just as old and gross as Oro
[2:40:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:41:00] <PorkLoinHustle> corner i think
[2:41:05] <%jinking79> still laugh at Max getting exposed for Oro stomp being fireball motion no Dp LUL
[2:41:06] <+thedream_c> S3 I think. I saw one of the tourneys and Abigail players were just tearing it up on their way to top 32s
[2:41:11] <+TopTieramisu> oro's wife, ara
[2:41:19] <+Arek_1> @jinking79 LUL
[2:41:19] <+waltzqueen> @TopTieramisu Ara ara
[2:41:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> not really, he was just strong but never such a threat that he took over meta
[2:42:25] <+TopTieramisu> something about abigail's proportions doesn't work for me
[2:42:41] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think he had to be as tall as he is
[2:42:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> i get that
[2:43:06] <Man_in_the_Red> you saying a street fighter character has issues with proportions, crazy
[2:43:13] <+thedream_c> i dunno. maybe they did think that most of the Mad Gear bosses were at least 6'10" and above
[2:43:17] <+thedream_c> outside of Belger
[2:43:20] <+BarbosaEdit> good night ppl
[2:43:23] <+TopTieramisu> @Man_in_the_Red i don't mean in comparison to a real person, i mean as a character design
[2:43:35] <Applecannon63> Seriously tho Ryu should just become Oro at this point since he 's already done with satsui no hadou shit
[2:43:39] <Man_in_the_Red> that said Huge Quest over there has no reason to be as top heavy
[2:43:57] <+thedream_c> that cmd grab has mad range
[2:44:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> abigiail is the biggest character in street fighter cause he was huge in final fight
[2:44:01] <+thedream_c> oh yeah cuz its a hit grab
[2:44:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause hugo was big and he's bigger than him
[2:44:17] <+BarbosaEdit> i spent 4 WHOLE HOURS in akira's trial, i'm pissed and accomplished at the same time.
[2:44:17] <Saltmeisterr> hmm
[2:44:19] <Applecannon63> Ryu would do good as a hermit than your typical hobo fighter
[2:44:43] <%Sparkseid> R3 does a quick reset
[2:44:49] <Applecannon63> Ryu doing basically naruto style senjutsu
[2:44:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Applecannon63 that's why oro secretly trains him as well as is super invested into him
[2:44:56] <+TopTieramisu> i like hugo's design way more than abigail's
[2:45:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TopTieramisu hugo is way better than abigail
[2:45:08] <KaiserMario> LUL Poor Woolie, he's not used to this
[2:45:14] <+TopTieramisu> probably helps that he's a caricature of an interesting person irl
[2:45:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> but without hugo, i went to abigial
[2:45:24] <+TopTieramisu> interesting-looking person*
[2:45:38] <+thedream_c> yeah i didnt know Oro was based off Helio Gracie
[2:46:07] <+thedream_c> so that old dangerous martial artist mystique definitely carries over with the Oro design
[2:46:32] <Applecannon63> Oro goes unga
[2:47:18] <Applecannon63> funfact Nero's standard buster attack is based of Oro's Kishin Riki Throw
[2:47:33] <%jinking79> rocks lets u get away with a lot of shit
[2:47:40] <+TopTieramisu> holy shit, i can totally see oro's design coming from helio
[2:47:47] <Applecannon63> Rock=Best custom combo
[2:48:06] <%Josef_Stryker> Trial 9 sucks
[2:48:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:48:11] <Applecannon63> how many balls does Sean have!?
[2:48:11] <%jinking79> the Dinosaurs let v trigger lasted longer right
[2:48:30] <NotHereToStream> yeah, and blanka chan dolls
[2:48:34] <+thedream_c> not enough to make Sean relevant again sadly
[2:48:35] <+cmac92> Dragonball is Life!
[2:48:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's more than half life right there wow
[2:48:49] <Applecannon63> I mean Oro is literally Roshi
[2:49:07] <+TopTieramisu> sf has been referencing different mangas from the beginning
[2:49:09] <+thedream_c> Akira gets to play her own game wwhich is cool
[2:49:13] <Applecannon63> he is even has a thing for young girls
[2:49:22] <%jinking79> Kenny took 2 hours on Trial 3 LUL
[2:49:23] <+TopTieramisu> rose is literally lisa lisa
[2:49:30] <Applecannon63> AKIRA is just AIR FREEDOM
[2:49:36] <+thedream_c> URR combos
[2:49:42] <Applecannon63> also Daigo is the best assist
[2:49:43] <+thedream_c> for those who have been missing that in their SFV
[2:50:02] <%ChoculaUltra> there has to be a Daigo Umehara mod for the Daigo assist by now
[2:50:15] <Applecannon63> Akira has so many custom combos
[2:50:25] <Applecannon63> to rival Ibul
[2:50:31] <Applecannon63> *Ibuki
[2:50:37] <+TopTieramisu> if someone can mod in daigo's realistic face on daigo, i'd be done
[2:50:44] <PorkLoinHustle> does that work on normal hit?
[2:50:49] <primaryfire> I don't get why these trials don't show buttons by default
[2:51:17] <Applecannon63> Daigo Umehara or Daigo Ikeno?
[2:51:22] <+TopTieramisu> umehara
[2:51:29] <+TopTieramisu> i don't even know how ikeno looks like
[2:51:47] <@Solidus_113> remember fun?
[2:52:06] <President_valentine> Akira is probably the most fun I've had in SFV
[2:52:11] <NotHereToStream> this is just dust in SFV
[2:52:59] <@Solidus_113> There's also Seth to check out @WoolieVersus
[2:53:02] <+TopTieramisu> is otoko no senaka her brother's move?
[2:53:06] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:53:13] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:53:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:53:48] <Saltmeisterr> EHAHAHA MY NAME IS SETH
[2:54:09] <@Solidus_113> they got the jojo moves, it's cool
[2:54:22] <+TopTieramisu> oh look, it's the original final character for sfv
[2:54:24] <%Irridium> fuckin A+ design though
[2:54:32] <%justmildlilac> You can definitely tell the difference of Devs who care about the character and the ones who don't when you look at Akira
[2:54:33] <President_valentine> Remember Seth? He's back in waifu form
[2:54:35] <PorkLoinHustle> he has fun combos and so does gill
[2:54:45] <%Josef_Stryker> Seth has probably gotten the biggest upgrade in terms of character designs
[2:54:46] <%justmildlilac> She had so much love put in you can see it
[2:54:55] <+TopTieramisu> seth learned how to harness the power of waifu
[2:55:04] <%Josef_Stryker> And not just because he's sexy now it's just a much more interesting look than the Adonis look that Gill and Urien already filled
[2:55:22] <+TopTieramisu> seth got whooped by juri and thought "i want some of that"
[2:55:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:55:25] <PorkLoinHustle> it does if you have display buttons instead of move names
[2:56:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Not gonna check out Gill?
[2:56:17] <%justmildlilac> Yeah what about Gill
[2:56:22] <PorkLoinHustle> Gill is fun in this one
[2:56:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> daigo is so good
[2:56:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, he stops characters from moving forward
[2:56:44] <+TopTieramisu> oh, otoko no senaka is literally the daigo assist
[2:57:05] <%Vextalyst> Vextalyst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Yo woolie the other day some lady hit me with that shmovement. It was a popular train stop and I was eyeing a seat. As the person in got off, this lady pushed past me saying "getting off" only to sit in the seat I was eyeing. Yo I got mixed
[2:57:17] <President_valentine> light fireball
[2:57:27] <%Sparkseid> light not heavy
[2:58:12] <ElPlasa> Would crossup j.HK work there?
[2:58:37] <President_valentine> you can
[2:58:41] <%Josef_Stryker> I don't think H.HK crossups
[2:58:46] <%Josef_Stryker> *J.HK
[2:58:53] <Applecannon63> I do wish she had her Tardy Counter as a move than V reversal like Batsu
[2:58:55] <sleepybeaver21> j.mk is a crossup
[2:58:57] <President_valentine> Punk uses it
[2:59:03] <+bear_breaker20> Woolie!

[3:01:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh the bike changes colors too
[3:01:27] <President_valentine> the costume code removes her helmet
[3:01:32] <DSD24> Hey does Akira's line change wearing the Biker costume?
[3:01:34] <+TopTieramisu> rose looks great
[3:01:39] <Applecannon63> @dsd24 yup
[3:01:41] <+TopTieramisu> surprised they didn't change her outfit at all
[3:01:43] <%Josef_Stryker> The biker costume also changes her dialogue to be more aggressive
[3:01:44] <DSD24> That's rad
[3:01:50] <ElPlasa> She got buffed? wasn't she already really good?
[3:01:56] <%Josef_Stryker> Not really
[3:02:00] <Afrosamasenpai> Jimmy not playing Barlog no more? You hate to see it.
[3:02:09] <%Josef_Stryker> The buffs she got sound really promising for her tho
[3:02:20] <Applecannon63> They buffed her card gimmick that she can combo with it

[3:37:31] <@Moobot> @Shad0wTag WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 2 minutes
[3:37:46] <Applecannon63> @TheLocalRival Luke looks likes he'll introduce some new mechanics
[3:38:06] <TheLocalRival> If Luke is anything like Ed im uninstalling the game
[3:38:43] <%jinking79> did Reggie hold up while holding 3 punches and kick?
[3:39:00] <Applecannon63> his gameplay is less Ed with the way he's doing barrages of fire ball punches
[3:39:23] <TheLocalRival> Lol imagine mashing LP to get gatling projectiles
[3:39:24] <Applecannon63> and the buff dp like move
[3:39:46] <TheLocalRival> Lol press LP to win with arm sonic booms
[3:40:06] <Applecannon63> I just wish Proximity normals return
[3:40:55] <Applecannon63> Akira would've benefit that system
[3:40:56] <primaryfire> yeah never liked proximity normals
[3:40:58] <blackkanye> I don't like them either
[3:41:00] <%Sparkseid> not a fan
[3:41:10] <Spirit_9B> I miss them
[3:41:14] <%concretenj> Doing nago close slash combos reminded me of how much I hate them
[3:41:19] <TheLocalRival> Proximity Normals suck
[3:41:44] <TheLocalRival> but to each their own
[3:41:47] <+CaptainPyron> Command Normals way better.
[3:41:56] <TheLocalRival> SF6 is going to be some stupid shit, I bet on it
[3:42:07] <blackkanye> Yeah there are times with characters in guilty gear where I want cS and I know it would hit, but it doesn't come out and I KNOW it would hit from the distance
[3:42:41] <TheLocalRival> Wonder if they'll put simple controls from Marvel inside
[3:43:11] <Applecannon63> Proximity could've worked as as seperate buttons
[3:43:11] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1427490836829417483?s=19
[3:43:15] <TheLocalRival> What if SF6 is a tag game PogChamp
[3:43:26] <TheLocalRival> Daigo is just them labbing with assists
[3:44:02] <TheLocalRival> Someones gotta play Eleven
[3:44:20] <%Josef_Stryker> Tengu Mask Dan is such a good costume
[3:44:32] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[3:44:45] <+ThePayphone> drip
[3:44:51] <TheLocalRival> Tracksuit only Kappa
[3:44:52] <Applecannon63> like I get auto proximity normals are rough but if they implemented into a seperate buttons that be cool
[3:45:12] <TheLocalRival> Dang I like the tracksuit but I miss seeing his diaper ngl
[3:45:19] <Applecannon63> than having to be just command normals
[3:45:32] <TheLocalRival> Also that KOFXV character leak is a chefs kiss
[3:45:32] <KingSpunf> man, Oro ugly af
[3:45:43] <TheLocalRival> SF should get some of their character designers
[3:45:48] <KingSpunf> if he was any uglier, he'd be an MK character
[3:45:50] <Applecannon63> Ugly is his charm tho
[3:45:51] <BeanWarrior> Dan da man
[3:46:01] <+ThePayphone> dont be mean to oro man
[3:46:03] <TheLocalRival> Why u guys shitting on Oro
[3:46:05] <TheLocalRival> come on man
[3:46:08] <Rawgameplayguy> QC grab i thunk is the back and forth slam
[3:46:13] <%jinking79> the Strap-On Mask
[3:46:20] <Rawgameplayguy> qcb i think
[3:46:36] <Applecannon63> Oro shows beauty in his appearance than Ken can ever be
[3:46:46] <Rawgameplayguy> if no qcf
[3:46:48] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[3:46:58] <%Josef_Stryker> I wanna see them try Gill
[3:47:01] <Quikanims> it is astonishing to me that sfv made dan unironically cool
[3:47:01] <Rawgameplayguy> if not qcf
[3:47:08] <TheLocalRival> Imagine playing Oro with Ken's voice queues
[3:47:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Gill's really fun with retribution
[3:47:09] <Applecannon63> cause Ken's look is a mistake
[3:47:25] <TheLocalRival> Ken is uglier than Oro thats for sure
[3:47:54] <RyuuAoi> Is that Reggie's house?
[3:48:17] <DedlokPM> @RyuuAoi no. They are all at Woolie's
[3:48:40] <RyuuAoi> Oh. Reggie just got put in a box! Ha
[3:49:34] <Applecannon63> Reggie going for the kill
[3:49:46] <Applecannon63> Satsui no Hadou

[3:51:10] <+chief_chongo> doodSurvive
[3:51:31] <slix3431> I thought Oro was holding a basketball but it's a turtle
[3:51:44] <Applecannon63> Dan should just be the new Ryu
[3:51:59] <TheLocalRival> With how brolic dan is
[3:52:00] <KingSpunf> Dan's cool
[3:52:13] <Applecannon63> Dan lost father give him a break
[3:52:15] <TheLocalRival> it has me believing that one of the developers was a Dan main as a kid and got whoooped
[3:52:19] <%Irridium> I would be super down with Dan being the new Ryu
[3:52:44] <TheLocalRival> and he vowed that when he got the chance he would buff Dan so that other kids would never get made fun of for playing Dan again
[3:52:49] <%pupil31> LUL
[3:52:51] <%Sparkseid> damn reggie
[3:52:53] <Applecannon63> Like Dan shows progress in gameplay than Ryu
[3:52:54] <KingSpunf> NO UGGOS
[3:52:59] <slix3431> I can't get over Oro bringing a turtle to this fight
[3:52:59] <%Josef_Stryker> THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN!
[3:53:02] <+Your_Lord_and_Senpai> lmao Reggie
[3:53:10] <RyuuAoi> KILL HIM, WOOLIE
[3:53:19] <SomersaultJustice> dan really should say "The Future is Now" as a win quote
[3:53:29] <+Kuhfeek> @slix3431 The turtle brought Oro to the fight
[3:53:37] <Applecannon63> My dad was tough and he's dead
[3:53:53] <slix3431> @Kuhfeek I hadn't considered it that way. That way gives me less anxiety
[3:53:54] <TheLocalRival> @Applecannon63 Bro are you Rock Howard?
[3:54:06] <Applecannon63> actual quote from Dan in Alpha
[3:54:27] <TheLocalRival> Hahhaha
[3:54:28] <Applecannon63> But Dan could definitely be Rock Howard
[3:54:56] <Applecannon63> like Ed was thought to be Rock Howard but ehhhhhh
[3:55:06] <viidust> my dad is tougher than you and he's dead*
[3:55:38] <RyuuAoi> GOTTA give that one to Reggie.

[3:56:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeaaaah, abigial
[3:56:51] <SomersaultJustice> pick the kage with the monocle
[3:56:54] <%kewlmyc> Necalli, the character who has to job story wise, or else everyone would be dead.
[3:57:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> abigial so big and ugly i love him
[3:57:15] <TheLocalRival> Necalli the hugest jobber
[3:57:17] <%Josef_Stryker> Reggie's on a warpath

[3:57:38] <Applecannon63> I wish for Necali's redemption
[3:57:41] <Digsby> Jobs and kills nobody... in a story where Charlie HAS t odie
[3:58:04] <WakeUpThrow> Right?!
[3:58:11] <%jinking79> right Necali has a normal v trigger
[3:58:21] <@Solidus_113> for shift isn't it?
[3:58:27] <RyuuAoi> Woolie gonna get back in there groove. Just wait!
[3:58:29] <WakeUpThrow> At least let Necalli have THAT w in the story
[3:58:30] <SunsetJack> So he can V shift yes.
[3:58:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, i think it's for shift
[3:58:42] <primaryfire> and for vreversal
[3:58:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's what they said
[3:59:04] <SunsetJack> If you trigger, you can't reversal or shift.
[3:59:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[4:00:30] <Applecannon63> What if Necali could steal Ryu's Satsui no Hado just eat Kage from out existence
[4:00:36] <Applecannon63> as his story
[4:00:41] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL

[4:26:07] <%Sparkseid> GGs shake my hand
[4:26:16] <TheHeroAppears> the only way to get revenge is to get a crutch and fake casts

[4:26:43] <yukichocomilk> nago is a savage

[4:27:05] <SomersaultJustice> destiny is destiny
[4:27:08] <shotgang86> pocket sand
[4:27:19] <Applecannon63> woah I didn't know Nago becomes honorless
[4:27:19] <slix3431> That doesn't seem very effective
[4:27:21] <%Irridium> I mean hey whatever works works
[4:27:22] <SomersaultJustice> if you're in trouble, play to win
[4:27:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> GIVE HIM THE DICKTWIST
[4:27:23] <shotgang86> z-target the balls
[4:27:23] <+tempestzephyr> not need for honor
[4:27:32] <%andrewofbob> Practical self-defence advice. Also - Just run.
[4:27:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> GRAB HIS DICK AND TWIST IT
[4:27:35] <RyuuAoi> Go for the eyes, Reggie
[4:27:37] <%arkv01> honor is stored in the balls
[4:27:40] <RyuuAoi> Or nose.
[4:27:40] <+DrPoxx> always go for the balls eyes or throat
[4:27:41] <SomersaultJustice> for honor?  no, for fun
[4:27:45] <+DrPoxx> soft targets bb
[4:27:50] <@Solidus_113> that's a clean hit every time
[4:27:56] <Applecannon63> I elbowed someone in the balls
[4:28:14] <Applecannon63> went rimonchouchuu
[4:28:14] <%jinking79> Batman once said "If u can't win in a Fair Fight (throws marbles on the ground) Cheat"
[4:28:30] <SomersaultJustice> mask off forever
[4:28:47] <SunsetJack> It looks like a taunt thing lol
[4:28:57] <yukichocomilk> prob just cosmetic
[4:29:00] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I kinda prefer Jack-o with the mask on, she seems happy with the mask off too tho
[4:29:05] <+Mister_Rogers> my man jimmy
[4:29:16] <primaryfire> it's also really not fun
[4:29:29] <xxshadowxx416> wish it was justice move set
[4:29:30] <SunsetJack> I mean, wallbreak would stop houses lol
[4:29:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that said Jack-o is really not that hard to play in Rev2, but at a glance yeah she's fucked
[4:29:34] <@Solidus_113> Jack-O with the mask off is super smug in Strive though
[4:30:12] <@Solidus_113> there's something about a mechanic they couldn't add in for launch
[4:30:20] <Applecannon63> Jack-O should've become Justice tho
[4:30:21] <@Solidus_113> could be IKs
[4:30:27] <SomersaultJustice> isn't it that tag thing?
[4:30:28] <SunsetJack> I bet they will nerf BRC.
[4:30:34] <Applecannon63> IK and give us EX MOVES
[4:30:43] <Applecannon63> EX MOVES MUST RETURN
[4:30:44] <+Dova573> #GIVEAXLADP
[4:30:48] <+Dova573> Kappa
[4:30:49] <primaryfire> with the damage in that game I really don't want them back lol
[4:30:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> IK-s would be peak hype for me
[4:30:57] <SunsetJack> There was practical use in Xrd.
[4:31:03] <Applecannon63> FORCE BREAK EX MOVE
[4:31:05] <+Dova573> But for reall make the meter 4 bars
[4:31:13] <@Solidus_113> clean hit EX DP let's goooooooo
[4:31:15] <+Dova573> Get rid of RISK
[4:31:25] <+DrPoxx> give a character a low kick infinite lol
[4:31:45] <+Dova573> And Give Axl a DP
[4:32:00] <TheHeroAppears> birthday train pls
[4:32:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a Nago won EVO now you gotta win Woolie
[4:32:06] <SunsetJack> IK in Xrd were practical cause you might not be able to kill someone if they have low HP, close to burst or high guts lol
[4:32:09] <Applecannon63> NAGO NEEDS EX MOVES
[4:32:11] <SomersaultJustice> disaster of passion
[4:32:52] <Applecannon63> hell yeah Woolie mod

[5:12:48] <@Solidus_113> it's not canon unless Reggie wins
[5:15:10] <%Josef_Stryker> I love Millia's theme so much
[5:16:41] <DMatts142> yeah it cant block supers, or if you get between Eddie & Zato
[5:16:42] <SunsetJack> Everything as in supers too?
[5:16:53] <DMatts142> Supers & grabs will break Oppose
[5:17:13] <DMatts142> yeah I think Oppose goes from Armor to an attack after 1 full second?
[5:17:15] <velgaduere> reggiePeek
[5:17:44] <DMatts142> Ive been trying to learn Strive & been enjoying Zato, I just need to work on my timing & getting a feel for the pacing of the game

[5:19:02] <+fetrigon> pfffffffffffftt
[5:20:18] <+fetrigon> he sure does

[5:21:41] <%jinking79> shit i do jump a lot with Leo
[5:21:58] <+musmayrelchup> what floor is woolie on?\
[5:21:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:22:31] <KINGRAY898> the zato pressure and combos are terrifying
[5:22:36] <+fetrigon> @musmayrelchup celestial VIP I think
[5:22:49] <DMatts142> I want to have this clean of a Zato one day holy crap
[5:23:02] <+musmayrelchup> I thought he was up there, with nago right?
[5:23:16] <+fetrigon> @musmayrelchup ye
[5:24:24] <%FoxLex_> Being Jimmy's training partner. Reggie is seeing what I see a lot of
[5:24:46] <+fetrigon> oooo
[5:25:22] <%FoxLex_> Life is pretty much caught to me so I don't much time to play
[5:25:51] <+fetrigon> pfffft
[5:25:59] <+fetrigon> yo holy shit
[5:25:59] <SunsetJack> That super is +12 on block if I recall.
[5:26:05] <%FoxLex_> Yep
[5:26:14] <+Lionkevinson> jeesus
[5:26:18] <KINGRAY898> thats disgusting
[5:26:23] <%FoxLex_> You have to instinctively super jump to avoid it
[5:26:38] <%FoxLex_> Unless you're Goldlewis
[5:26:38] <SunsetJack> Zato not having any reversal super is a bit rough.
[5:26:45] <%FoxLex_> He can't jump too high
[5:26:52] <+Lionkevinson> the french coming out
[5:26:58] <+fetrigon> LUL
[5:27:03] <%kotl7> as a french viewer, I'm delighted LUL
[5:27:16] <+Lionkevinson> moi aussi :-)
[5:27:38] <SunsetJack> I mean, it applies for certain stages in online too in other games?
[5:27:43] <+AhegodKira> PC chads win again, no lag there
[5:27:53] <%FoxLex_> They are playing on PC
[5:27:58] <SunsetJack> Nah, it lags on PC.
[5:28:03] <%FoxLex_> This stage is known to lag
[5:28:08] <+polothegreatest> training stage 4ever
[5:28:08] <DMatts142> Pot stage I think? Pot or Zato stage
[5:28:15] <SunsetJack> dustloop wiki has a page on it
[5:28:16] <Zombrocom> PC you get the people who cant run the game because they play of potatoes
[5:28:22] <+AhegodKira> "works fine for me" :)
[5:28:22] <alexanderthe4793> smash is past that for the legal stages, the other ones just try to kill you
[5:28:23] <%Irridium> Think Lars Canyon is the second least laggy stage
[5:28:37] <%FoxLex_> In SamShobthere are only two banned stages
[5:28:46] <+polothegreatest> therea a potato mod for GGS and SFV
[5:28:52] <%FoxLex_> People pick Nikko cus they have zero taste tho
[5:28:55] <%jolene_orenji> jellyfish skyquarium is the laggiest stage which sucks cuz it's my favorite
[5:29:00] <KreuzDrache> okay, I got super dumb idea: What if, instead of modeling the far background, they instead made it into an fmv(for stages with lots of movement) or render for stages like this?
[5:29:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:29:03] <DrWavy> Good thing music  not tied to stage
[5:29:15] <KreuzDrache> still-image render*
[5:29:23] <KINGRAY898> watching you guys play just makes me want to go and train some more, i got a long ways to go stuck on floor 7 & 8
[5:29:37] <+jordy_j_s> who's playing rn?
[5:29:45] <%FoxLex_> Jimmy and Reggie
[5:29:47] <DMatts142> LUL
[5:29:49] <+jordy_j_s> ty
[5:29:51] <SunsetJack> Jimmy (Zato) VS Reggie (Milia)
[5:30:17] <KINGRAY898> the comeback
[5:30:20] <yukichocomilk> throw into disc is fake right?
[5:30:39] <KINGRAY898> that combo tho
[5:30:58] <Applecannon63> LUL LUL LUL
[5:31:05] <SunsetJack> I feel that depends on the super on the damage.
[5:31:19] <SunsetJack> Super is more for knockdown.
[5:31:21] <Smitteys867> was trying to learn Ky for a while, was frustrated at how restrictive he felt. Just picked up Leo on a whim and honestly he can do most things ky does better and easier
[5:31:43] <DMatts142> @Smitteys867 yeah Ky lost a lot of sauce/stuff from Xrd to Strive IMO
[5:32:02] <SunsetJack> Change stages.
[5:32:51] <Zombrocom> Ky takes dedication and patience
[5:32:55] <alexanderthe4793> whats the least laggy stage in this game?
[5:33:08] <%FoxLex_> There are 4 stages that are playable
[5:33:09] <DMatts142> @alexanderthe4793 I think its Pot's or Zato's stage
[5:33:10] <Zombrocom> Canyon?
[5:33:22] <Zombrocom> Nah pots stage is pretty laggy I think. The snow one?
[5:33:23] <@Solidus_113> lars canyon, a happy family, Council of Three
[5:33:26] <Murdercles> go watch what players like churara and infinity can do with ky
[5:33:35] <SunsetJack> Canyon, Heaven, Observatory, Family and Three are less laggy.
[5:33:36] <%FoxLex_> Canyon, Pot's stage, Zato's stage, Fausts's stage
[5:34:05] <%FoxLex_> Those have little to no lag so that's what PC plays
[5:34:20] <SunsetJack> There exist already.
[5:34:22] <+fetrigon> already done
[5:34:23] <%DrSmashy> I switched from May to Ky. I miss being able to just mash slash and jumping heavy.
[5:34:25] <Zombrocom> Oh those mods exist
[5:34:25] <%FoxLex_> Strangely enough
[5:34:27] <SunsetJack> There are some with less or all elements removed.
[5:34:28] <alexanderthe4793> snow stages are just less laggy huh. "You've been a great audience, anyway here's Bonne Wonderland again!"
[5:34:33] <Zombrocom> There are mods that delete the entire background
[5:34:38] <%FoxLex_> PS4 somehow has less lag on stages
