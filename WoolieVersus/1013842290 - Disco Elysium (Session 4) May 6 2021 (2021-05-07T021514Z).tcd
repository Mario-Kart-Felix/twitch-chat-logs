[0:05:25] <+FlubbedPig> Well, Quebec specifically, not all of Canada.
[0:05:28] <Prevot> language is Tier 1 prejudice
[0:05:31] <Blackscience91> That's incredible
[0:05:33] <$emptyantics> YORGOS LATHIMOS

[0:06:04] <Blank9> I don't know what's the problem, it's just a funny vaccine shot.

[0:07:56] <andre11dr> Everyone getting hooked on that shit
[0:07:58] <%Lion_kun> If only they fix the save system or lack of.
[0:08:04] <deviljhojho_> I've heard returnal is good at everything except at being a roguelite
[0:08:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> going good, my arm hurts still but yeah, 5g'd up
[0:08:05] <CappuccinoGuil> Returnal looks like it does shoot good
[0:08:11] <%Arancet> @Kazerz_Twitch no interest/plans i think
[0:08:11] <aiutare47> @deviljhojho_ They do. Its just got an extra language dimension to it in Quebec
[0:08:11] <@Menitta> Returnal is incredible
[0:08:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> for anyone that's played it, how does it compare to risk of rain 2? because the way pat described it, it seemed to have some similarities
[0:08:22] <@Menitta> Yeah thats frustrating
[0:08:28] <%Lion_kun> Just dark souls it
[0:08:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Bro, just put your PS5 in rest mode, bro, it's alright, bro Kappa
[0:08:33] <%andrewofbob> I understand the runs are LONG
[0:08:33] <aiutare47> @cobalt_phoenix_ nothing like it
[0:08:36] <crimsonharvest> oh damn
[0:08:47] <%Arancet> @cobalt_phoenix_ pretty similar, more itnersting gameplay, less interesting items
[0:08:51] <foxname96> Hey chat! Is Trails of Mana any good??? Thinking on buying it on ps4 sale now
[0:08:53] <crimsonharvest> im just about to go and exercise but i'll be back to see as much as i can
[0:08:53] <+Mendin> That haptic rumble baybeeee
[0:08:55] <+Sir_Louis> Not even HD rumble?
[0:08:57] <%birddotexe> Sophisticated Rumble is my drag name
[0:08:58] <@Menitta> I'm playing it right now!
[0:09:01] <$emptyantics> Trials of Mana is good
[0:09:03] <CappuccinoGuil> @andrewofbob hours upon hours, with no autosave.
[0:09:06] <@Menitta> Yeah it's WILD
[0:09:22] <andre11dr> Better than the rumble pack? no way Kappa
[0:09:29] <%Arancet> what? never played astro's playroom? thats the high bar
[0:09:29] <+NopeBadguy> It goes a long way in contributing to game feel
[0:09:34] <$hattrick61> which game is this?
[0:09:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @hattrick61 returnal
[0:09:44] <$hattrick61> ty
[0:09:50] <JetpackMcQuack> What if pressure sensitivity worked
[0:09:51] <%krispen_wa> CONCEPTUALIZATION
[0:09:54] <Lancaster_H> this console generation has basically become "but the PS5 controller tho" for me because of these
[0:09:55] <Kazerz_Twitch> The rumbling NotLikeThis
[0:09:55] <benupde287> tsushima was like that for ps4
[0:10:00] <@Menitta> There's a J cut transition in the game that uses rumble and it WORKS SO WELL
[0:10:00] <+undeadarchitect> The Rumbling....(shudder)
[0:10:04] <iacus_> Conceptualization drop
[0:10:04] <ReganSenpai> did you play Astro's Playroom?
[0:10:04] <derap41> Does is tickle the prostate?
[0:10:06] <+RyTYoung> it's gooood
[0:10:09] <%andrewofbob> Were there any old ZX Spectrum games with no save and hours long playtimes?
[0:10:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh god not the rumbling NotLikeThis
[0:10:16] <@Solidus_113> shush
[0:10:19] <Kazerz_Twitch> 139
[0:10:24] <dds333a> @derap41 if you try hard enough
[0:10:25] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! I wager a lot of it is Sony pushing developers to use it. I think Sony, especially from the last gen, has a LOT of leverage or perceived leverage with developers in terms of optimization priority and feature-use
[0:10:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i aint sayin a thing :)
[0:10:34] <CappuccinoGuil> Conceptualization is important because without, you won't figure out why something is racist. Raise your concept levels, everyone

[0:10:56] <+RyTYoung> sadly...
[0:10:58] <%Arancet> super creepy story
[0:11:06] <%kyh9> YOU BEAT IT IN ONE SITTING OR DIE
[0:11:10] <%Irridium> I mean new console new features games gotta have. Anyone else remember sixaxis
[0:11:11] <%birddotexe> @CappuccinoGuil Embrace Conceptualization. Become Raphael Ambrosius Costeau.
[0:11:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> now if only i had a ps5 to play it
[0:11:14] <Lancaster_H> @CappuccinoGuil conceptualization is also important to be racist in creative ways
[0:11:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Just use rest mode, Bro, it's all good, Bro. Why do you need saves? Kappa
[0:11:18] <%ekodrop> problem is sessions can take forever
[0:11:18] <@Menitta> No suspend
[0:11:20] <tattleworm> it's supposed to use the ps5's rest mode but that thing's unreliable as all hell
[0:11:21] <%kyh9> House Marque: Beat it in one 4 hour sitting or fuck off
[0:11:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @Lancaster_H that's why you keep it below 9
[0:11:33] <@Solidus_113> and runs are like 3 hours max
[0:11:36] <@Menitta> They can last a while
[0:11:45] <%Lion_kun> Put the PS5 on rest and ruin your save when the game updates
[0:11:45] <%kyh9> We going ARCADE style
[0:11:45] <+undeadarchitect> Endgame PS5 dual sense is going to be cool hopefully
[0:11:51] <dds333a> Hence, the rogue"lite" aspect, because it isn't a hard reset
[0:11:59] <%andrewofbob> @CappuccinoGuil What if I want to put it down and switch to something else, like a party invite?
[0:11:59] <%PMAvers> There's also some save file glitches that are corrupting save files in Returnal.
[0:11:59] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Enter the Gungeon also had no saves during the run, a lot of games dont. But Returnal is just too long
[0:12:05] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus IT'S mAX'S GOTY RN
[0:12:08] <Chatterbox1991> caps
[0:12:09] <%nintega010> but the lore is good so it makes the run longer
[0:12:11] <+RyTYoung> Keep checking your ships terminal @woolieversus
[0:12:13] <BlackermanZX> yeah its more of a rogue lite
[0:12:15] <%Lion_kun> Gungeon saved between floors
[0:12:17] <Johannen> They patched saves into Enter the Gungeon
[0:12:18] <Blank9> the newest version of "MOM, I CAN'T PAUSE IT IT'S MULTIPLAYER"
[0:12:20] <%hax_metatron> Not being able to play another game I want is a bummer
[0:12:23] <@Menitta> Yeah its not the best roguelike, mechanically but everything it sets out to do is incredible otherwise
[0:12:30] <%kyh9> IT CLOSES
[0:12:31] <%kyh9> LMAO
[0:12:37] <%hologram_sam> It's either going to take a couple weeks or half a year to get the save system work
[0:12:48] <+trackles_64> developer oversight
[0:12:52] <andre11dr> Most RL games usually don't have 3 hours long runs so thats why it feels annoying on this one
[0:12:52] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:12:55] <%PMAvers> And sometimes, it'll delete your save and then it'll delete your cloud save.
[0:12:56] <Lancaster_H> hades' save is the best version of rougelike saving system
[0:12:57] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember, folks: games should respect your time and existence. Save everywhere system.
[0:13:00] <@Menitta> Oh yeah that happened to me once lol
[0:13:07] <%andrewofbob> If there was cross-patch save incompatibility, then that's a problem to solve
[0:13:08] <%Arancet> @WoolieVersus dont use the preorder cosmetics suits if you got them, they cause bugs more often
[0:13:13] <JetpackMcQuack> moar cosmic horror
[0:13:19] <$dudedude55555> buy a second PS5 Kappa
[0:13:23] <aiutare47> fuckin sick
[0:13:27] <%krispen_wa> AMAZING
[0:13:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol preorder for bugs
[0:13:39] <Johannen> I just finished A Way Out, there is no pause in that game and that ifuriated me to no end
[0:13:39] <+undeadarchitect> A game is never done these days lol
[0:13:41] <%Seancicle> Casse-toi
[0:13:45] <BlackermanZX> preorder bugs is the new meta
[0:13:49] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil more or less, at risk of just trivializing any challenge. might as well just be savestates

[0:15:03] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus what are your thoughts on SHIVERS? do you like it?
[0:15:09] <laserbeaming> Did Woolie ever figure out that dialogues that start with "Wait," "Hold on," "First," don't advance dialogue?
[0:15:11] <%kyh9> CAD is just weaker
[0:15:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a Nah, I'd rather you be able to save your game, pause it and walk away at any moment because people have stuff to do. You can just.... not savescum it.
[0:15:13] <derap41> and Chinese investors
[0:15:15] <%kyh9> USD is just built different
[0:15:18] <%Lion_kun> You have an economy?
[0:15:20] <+undeadarchitect> They're not as cutthroat
[0:15:24] <%kyh9> USD lifts more
[0:15:27] <andre11dr> There's a difference?
[0:15:27] <+cubbywolf> they fuck us on the price all the time
[0:15:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Turns out we lose either way
[0:15:27] <+TheotherKristian> There√®s onyl 35 million of us, in comparison to 350 million in U.S., yeah our dollar is going to be worth slightly less
[0:15:28] <$dudedude55555> do you pay with maple leaves
[0:15:32] <%cache_22> Is $80 CAD including sales tax or is it like the US where it's $70 USD pre-tax?
[0:15:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> British Pound ftw woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[0:15:37] <@Menitta> I love the economy
[0:15:42] <Blank9> US can't even figure out USD, look at what $1 is in California vs Kentucky
[0:15:47] <+robo_trunk> 25% weaker than USD for some years now.
[0:15:50] <BigManLugan> moneys not real anyway
[0:15:52] <%KetsuoTaberu> those times were dope

[0:16:00] <+cubbywolf> that happened twice in my 30 years of life
[0:16:03] <+Bonkasaurusrex> $125 AU/ $95US
[0:16:04] <andre11dr> Can't we just all have the same economy, what could go wrong Kappa
[0:16:06] <+xBolts4Lifex> @BigManLugan give me all of your money then
[0:16:09] <+undeadarchitect> Imagine being Mexico
[0:16:10] <@Menitta> they do not drop
[0:16:14] <@Menitta> thats garbage
[0:16:14] <dukenux> Those brief moments, like when Vegeta is about as strong as Goku for like 5 seconds
[0:16:14] <+RAWPowerStudios> I wonder what determines why one dollar is worth more than another.
[0:16:25] <JetpackMcQuack> trickle down savings 4Head
[0:16:34] <+cubbywolf> there's alot that goes into dollar value of a nation
[0:16:34] <DatAsuna> No down, only up
[0:16:40] <derap41> But you also have more money on average
[0:16:42] <dds333a> @cappuccinoguil I agree, but saving anywhere without consequence will lead to most people savescumming it because that's literally what it lends itself to. it can also abjectly ruin any challenge or difficulty in a game, and besides, pausing has much the same effect
[0:16:43] <aiutare47> @RAWPowerStudios A lot of economy bullshit. Faith is a decent part of it

[0:17:07] <dukenux> @rawpowerstudios us economy is bigger than Canada i think, though im not an economist
[0:17:08] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a let people save scum it. It's okay. I don't care. Let them play how they want.

[0:17:15] <%krispen_wa> why does economy run on Faith when Miracle builds objectively suck?
[0:17:18] <dds333a> N.W.O

[0:20:48] <tattleworm> i'd rather them do it this way than what they did with mh world
[0:20:48] <%kyh9> Not even first-party. Like, FF7 Remake being on PS4/5 and FFXIV STILL not being on xbox
[0:20:54] <%Javaa01> Yeah, like the Xbone controllers had trigger rumble, but did anyone use it? Not outside of first party, because everyone was developing for PS4 first

[0:29:46] <DatAsuna> This was his first voice acting gig, right?
[0:29:48] <%hax_metatron> His voice is like drinking scotch in your ear
[0:29:53] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I want this narrator voice for something from Supergiant like Bastion or Hades, he'd be perfect!
[0:29:57] <leith_aziz> :O
[0:30:01] <%X2Eliah> I wish actual electric vehicles made such fun car noises
[0:30:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Literally the only thing I would be sad to see him miss would be the dialogue measurehead says when you become his pupil because I'd love to hear Woolie's uproarious laughter at how stupid he is
[0:30:07] <dds333a> Lenval? think so.
[0:30:10] <andre11dr> Damn ,these motherfuckers already got Teslas

[0:30:23] <Johannen> And it has radio controls? This Electric Car is so futuristic
[0:30:26] <+Firgof> Frittte has unlimited Health/Morale potions for you if you need them in future btw.
[0:30:38] <%X2Eliah> Ya but they cost money
[0:30:47] <andre11dr> I can hear the rain and this man's Highway like voice
[0:30:56] <leith_aziz> Same writer?
[0:30:58] <+Mendin> The Sacred and Terrible Air
[0:31:00] <Blank9> The book is also based on their own tabletop game setting.

[0:31:12] <+dalmek> yup, Robert Kurvitz (I think that's how you spell his name)
[0:31:14] <Lancaster_H> yeah the author wanted to make this a game iirc
[0:31:19] <Estwilde> Awesome
[0:31:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> My boy Kruvitz
[0:31:20] <dds333a> He also wants to make another book, too
[0:31:21] <aiutare47> its still only in Estonian I believe
[0:31:30] <%hax_metatron> Comrade Kurvitz
[0:31:31] <Estwilde> Now I gotta go look that up
[0:31:35] <%X2Eliah> They'd be mad if they don't adapt it to english
[0:31:38] <spaceitaly> but woolie? what if i wanted to avoid papercuts from the book? where would i go?
[0:31:39] <$JobbedBone> and iirc the book is based on a world made in a 10+ year tabletop campaign?
[0:31:40] <%Exiliator> Author turned game designer
[0:31:44] <DatAsuna> Yeah it's a weird fantasy setting
[0:31:47] <tenshi_q> pretty sure this game was a book and then the guy got convinced into making a game
[0:31:48] <%Mattismen> The game wasn't written entirely by one person, just so there's no confusion.
[0:31:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> There are great interviews with him, he seems cool
[0:32:11] <dds333a> @mattismen right, that should be specified
[0:32:13] <Louie_Salmon> @mattismen Oh yeah, I would assume not, that's entirely too much text
[0:32:15] <Blank9> I think yeah it was tabletop campaign -> book -> Disco Elysium

[0:38:19] <miucsa51> isn't apocalypse cop just rorschach?
[0:38:20] <%Javaa01> Past tense
[0:38:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The worst is when you get Doomsayers and The Noble Skletons with the goblets
[0:38:25] <andre11dr> End they have a late game version that's even worse
[0:38:31] <dukenux> @miucsa51 id imagine so
[0:38:31] <%KetsuoTaberu> monkaS
[0:38:35] <+Jeshk0> it aint bad, thats for sure
[0:38:35] <nakunattakage> monkaS
[0:38:35] <dds333a> @miucsa51 more or less
[0:38:37] <CappuccinoGuil> 3 kills in EIGHTEEN years
[0:38:38] <Prevot> monkaS
[0:38:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 3 in 18 years tho
[0:38:42] <leith_aziz> Well then...
[0:38:44] <aiutare47> Woolie knows?
[0:38:48] <%X2Eliah> Trust on Reggie to go for the insensitive response xD
[0:38:48] <+cubbywolf> only 3
[0:38:50] <+RAWPowerStudios> Not "killer" it's "KILLAH!"
[0:38:51] <%krispen_wa> One every 6 years
[0:38:52] <LlewynMarie> you're one of the good ones
[0:38:53] <dukenux> isn't that
[0:38:59] <dukenux> "good"
[0:39:03] <%Exiliator> Good cop
[0:39:04] <+trackles_64> tame
[0:39:04] <reonome> I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda
[0:39:05] <+Kataguro> Jamrock is FUCKED
[0:39:05] <%Deft_Thought> ACAB
[0:39:05] <leith_aziz> Really Kim?
[0:39:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Jamrock is a fuck
[0:39:07] <Blank9> I mean, 18 years.
[0:39:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Jamrock aint good
[0:39:11] <%kyh9> 3 kills over 18 years is REALLY good
[0:39:14] <derap41> Gotta Deathwish this up
[0:39:17] <%Irridium> LUL
[0:39:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Jamrock is a rough neigborhood
[0:39:20] <+trackles_64> Better than NY cops
[0:39:22] <%Arnoldoaad1> If you have high hand/eye coordination you already knew what the 3 perforations are before Kim explains it
[0:39:25] <Johannen> Jamrock is a big drug den prety much
[0:39:26] <%X2Eliah> 3 kills in 18 years is like... kinda normal / high for europe, and literally nothing for a US cop...
[0:39:26] <derap41> nn
[0:39:28] <+Kataguro> Kim hates bad cops
[0:39:28] <%krispen_wa> OOF
[0:39:29] <tenshi_q> straight outta Jamrock
[0:39:29] <AvroEltz> Jamrock is a shithole, the game makes sure to let you know that, multiple times
[0:39:32] <Estwilde> So we're actually a pretty good cop?
[0:39:34] <+cubbywolf> so instead of Blackwater mercs you join the police
[0:39:36] <Kazerz_Twitch> KILLOSYNTHESIS
[0:39:37] <+cubbywolf> and get some kills
[0:39:39] <+Jeshk0> shoot first, solve crimes never
[0:39:42] <derap41> Kill em all let god sort em out
[0:39:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> We WERE a good cop lmao
[0:39:45] <%Javaa01> @Estwilde You were, you aren't anymore
[0:39:47] <%hologram_sam> they're just looking for the post-kill nookie
[0:39:48] <%krispen_wa> WERE
[0:39:50] <+cubbywolf> def were
[0:39:53] <CappuccinoGuil> We're beautiful
[0:39:53] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> "at least"!
[0:39:57] <aiutare47> @X2Eliah Completely untrue though, like 99% of cops dont kill people
[0:39:57] <reonome> POUR ONE OUT FOR THE BOYS
[0:39:59] <derap41> Gotta ask
[0:40:08] <+Kataguro> Ask him
[0:40:21] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah Ya, but you wouldn't know if from movies/tv and media.
[0:40:27] <dds333a> fair enough
[0:40:28] <%krispen_wa> Drinking
[0:40:30] <%Deft_Thought> Holding a bag of trash and wearing a jacket you found in the trash. Yeah, "were" is accurate.
[0:40:32] <Kazerz_Twitch> @aiutare47 Atleast 99% of cops do kill a donut for lunch though so there's that
[0:40:42] <+Kataguro> Stave it off 1-2-3
[0:40:43] <leith_aziz> @X2Eliah I guess that's somewhat good to hear as EU, but still, you'd rather keep your resume clean.

[0:42:47] <aiutare47> Gloam is an old timey term for sunset
[0:42:49] <Dio_TR> Did Woolie read the whole ledger already?
[0:42:49] <krispen_wa> The Gloaming is when things gloam
[0:42:49] <derap41> @X2Eliah saying that is a spoiler

[1:15:06] <%BusterRepukken> you wanna get that check, its good
[1:15:06] <BurlyBeef> Kimposure
[1:15:06] <leith_aziz> Don't play into his games, Woolie
[1:15:11] <+undeadarchitect> I'll be dammed if I let a child disturb my inner peace
[1:15:12] <+Vigonept> let woolie play guys
[1:15:15] <+Kataguro> A little Inland wouldn't hurt
[1:15:16] <Indigo_Automaton> Yes you do
[1:15:18] <andre11dr> Kim must have 99 in Composer
[1:15:20] <Broand> Check your equipment too
[1:15:21] <NeekoFM> do it
[1:15:21] <superchunk121> Go level and come back
[1:15:23] <%X2Eliah> 6 is new btw
[1:15:24] <ingman112> For choices like that just pick what you like, you don't have to go back for us
[1:15:24] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Guys its fine, he has a Pass
[1:15:25] <+IvesNapalm> Do it Woolie
[1:15:25] <$hattrick61> Pretty sure coin slot was racist
[1:15:25] <Louie_Salmon> Yes
[1:15:26] <%hax_metatron> Sometimes, yeah
[1:15:26] <Yung_FckUp> do drugs
[1:15:27] <%Javaa01> @leith_aziz Or do, if you want more Cuno in your life
[1:15:27] <+walternatorz> You can leave the conversatiopn
[1:15:31] <BurlyBeef> Go shoot up in your room
[1:15:31] <%Sunriser41> this isna really good check
[1:15:31] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> you have to level the skill somehow
[1:15:35] <derap41> check your xp
[1:15:37] <Blank9> if you get a modifier or level that stat
[1:15:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sometimes yes
[1:15:39] <DSD24> Put a point in the stat
[1:15:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He's subscribed to F Pass Plus
[1:15:42] <aiutare47> you can find stuff like dialogue sometimes
[1:15:42] <+Jeshk0> some things will reopen certain checks
[1:15:43] <%hax_metatron> There are certainn mechanics tht unlock white checks, you'll learn as you keep pl aying
[1:15:43] <%ppangboi> some checks reset with new days
[1:15:44] <iacus_> tehy can be available via events or Internalizing Thoughts
[1:15:44] <+Vivaciousx3> taking down the body will get rid of this option right?
[1:15:44] <Indigo_Automaton> Level up or specific triggers
[1:15:45] <b_ikki> some dialogue can do that yeah
[1:15:46] <+TheotherKristian> God, this game is incredible. I'm probably gonna buy it twice, for my sibling
[1:15:46] <solaireprophet> When you level up and something you haven;t encountered yet
[1:15:46] <Yung_FckUp> do a savescum
[1:15:46] <Lancaster_H> talking, modifiers, thoughts
[1:15:48] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Only rare Thoughts, but more often its Leveling
[1:15:48] <+Firgof> Sometimes, yeah, but less frequently. You can check 'MAP' to see which ones are open
[1:15:48] <%Arancet> either level up or trigger something that gives oyu another point towards it
[1:15:48] <laserbeaming> When you get a modifier. You don't always get those though
[1:15:51] <primaryfire> not always but sometimes
[1:15:52] <$hattrick61> sometimes not always,
[1:15:53] <+undeadarchitect> Thought cabinets can unlock them too
[1:15:55] <CappuccinoGuil> There are other triggers, but points is the most reliable.
[1:16:06] <Futurecity10> Not for this one
[1:16:14] <aiutare47> @WoolieVersus certain thoughts and on rare occasions dialogue, but the game typically will tell you if thats the case
[1:16:18] <%andrewofbob> For example, I think VSC is keeping all endurance checks available
[1:16:20] <+Vigonept> its depends by check whether something opens it back up
[1:16:23] <Blank9> you'll get to it when you get to it, if you want
[1:16:23] <andre11dr> Points should do it
[1:16:27] <CappuccinoGuil> You did.
[1:16:29] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Has woolie checked the area yet?
[1:16:36] <Crippl3> It depends on the check, some do that yes
[1:16:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:16:47] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Sometimes you get those too
[1:16:47] <Blank9> It's based on if you do something that adds a modifier, like dialogue with someone about a white check.
[1:16:51] <derap41> That's your warning
[1:17:01] <aiutare47> maybe quicksave?
[1:17:02] <%hax_metatron> No you won't
[1:17:04] <+Vivaciousx3> level up or equip clothing with inland
[1:17:06] <nakunattakage> You won't
[1:17:06] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus What Blank9 said
[1:17:06] <%andrewofbob> Get IE up and retry befor the takedown
[1:17:08] <Johannen> You dont
[1:17:08] <$dudedude55555> take your tim
[1:17:09] <Indigo_Automaton> No you won't
[1:17:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You wont
[1:17:11] <+Kataguro> I don't think you lose the chance
[1:17:12] <%BusterRepukken> clothing?
[1:17:12] <+TheotherKristian> The only thoughts that are coming to me as I watch this stream is... thank goodness it's not my save slot
[1:17:13] <superchunk121> Take your time
[1:17:14] <%kewlmyc> You won't
[1:17:15] <%X2Eliah> You got to level the stat.
[1:17:16] <%hax_metatron> It's going to be a while before you get him down LUL
[1:17:16] <+Vigonept> not this one
[1:17:22] <ingman112> Save first and try?
[1:17:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @Reverend_Roscoe he's gone to Measurehead, the lorry jam and Joyce's boat.
[1:17:24] <%Arancet> we could help with twitch integration...
[1:17:25] <iacus_> can't take him down rn
[1:17:27] <Broand> Check your hear
[1:17:29] <Broand> gear*
[1:17:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, clothing doesn't unlock locked checks
[1:17:32] <laserbeaming> Do as you wish. I guess
[1:17:35] <$dudedude55555> he's not gunna run away
[1:17:36] <+IvesNapalm> You won't but putting the skill point in to retry isn't a bad idea
[1:17:37] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @CappuccinoGuil but not the immediate area
[1:17:42] <%andrewofbob> Bitch save is offline
[1:17:45] <+Vigonept> any gear for inland?
[1:17:48] <ingman112> Autosave anyway
[1:17:55] <andre11dr> Leveling up should do it
[1:17:55] <nelsonsaysbooya> Woolie and Reg buddy cop arc
[1:17:56] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Did you put the streamer assist thing Pat uses?
[1:17:57] <%hax_metatron> Play according to your instincts. You'll learn mechanics as you go...
[1:18:02] <+undeadarchitect> Remember that your gear gives you buffs when you try again
[1:18:02] <derap41> gear doesn't upen whitechecks
[1:18:03] <Johannen> That check will remain until you are fully done with the body
[1:18:08] <%X2Eliah> xD
[1:18:09] <%ppangboi> you will level up A LOT so don't worry too much about upping skills
[1:18:09] <%hax_metatron> Gear doesn't unlock whitechecks
[1:18:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Only two quicksaves at a time
[1:18:12] <Blank9> Worst comes to worst, you can go somewhere else to talk with someone, get levels, and come back.
[1:18:13] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> In real life, you don't just leave a dead body just sittin there, so it would make sense if it's kinda time locked
[1:18:13] <%hax_metatron> Drugs do
[1:18:14] <%X2Eliah> wop woop
[1:18:17] <Indigo_Automaton> You can go do other stuff and return
[1:18:18] <laserbeaming> You're pretty close. Paying your debt will probably give you enough
[1:18:20] <+AWKWARDL0SER> You can take him down and leave him for days
[1:18:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> talking to garte might get you enough xp
[1:18:21] <%kewlmyc> It's like saving skill points is a good thing.
[1:18:22] <Eger007> check clothes
[1:18:23] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus investigate the scene
[1:18:25] <derap41> 6 successes
[1:18:29] <andre11dr> Also you can probably try to look at the footsteps again
[1:18:31] <%Sunriser41> clothes
[1:18:33] <zanzibarian_hamster> Try paying rent for a level up
[1:18:34] <$hattrick61> CASH MONEY
[1:18:38] <%krispen_wa> YEYEYEYE TRASH
[1:18:42] <Indigo_Automaton> Aw yeah a nickel

[1:18:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus go pay your debt, it should finish a quest for you, I believe.
[1:18:48] <gunsrlove> Kick him
[1:18:52] <+Vigonept> ah right they failed, lame
[1:19:02] <nelsonsaysbooya> Visual Calculus and Inland Empire have locked checks

[1:19:31] <gunsrlove> Actually interrupting a police investigation, you can shoot him at this point
[1:19:31] <+Vigonept> Cuno trips for however long he wants
[1:19:33] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 1 and 2 on cuno are more question!!!

[1:20:03] <gunsrlove> When Cuno raises his hand for the next rock, just scream GUN and start blasting Kappa
[1:20:09] <dukenux> damn, they should re hightlight it

[1:45:38] <Blank9> "You're black"
[1:45:40] <+Kataguro> You were given a very low level observation. "Woman = Black"

[1:45:54] <+Damie904> Woolie you can pick the other options first to see if it ups your chances.
[1:45:55] <Blank9> you tried to have a thought and you couldn't notice anything
[1:45:56] <+IvesNapalm> You failed it though Woolie
[1:45:59] <+NopeBadguy> You failed it
[1:46:00] <zanzibarian_hamster> Now you understand the pain we feel woolie
[1:46:00] <+Walopoh> "hmm... You're Black."
[1:46:01] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That's what it means
[1:46:02] <CappuccinoGuil> You failed it
[1:46:02] <derap41> Racist Visual Calc
[1:46:03] <DSD24> You failed the check
[1:46:03] <Johannen> You FAILED it
[1:46:04] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You can do 1 and 2 first
[1:46:06] <mrapplebucks> was grandma black too
[1:46:07] <+Sir_Louis> thats why it's a failure

[1:46:07] <%kyh9> YOU FAILED THE CHECK

[1:46:08] <+Vigonept> FAILURE MEANS BAD
[1:46:08] <superchunk121> You failed it
[1:46:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YOU FAILED THE CHECK
[1:46:08] <Ardailec> You failed.
[1:46:09] <iacus_> but that was a failed branch tho
[1:46:09] <+Jeshk0> It was a BIG FAIL
[1:46:09] <+NopeBadguy> Woolie, you FAILED it
[1:46:10] <$hattrick61> I calculate that you are black
[1:46:13] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @AugiJr
[1:46:13] <+MightyDuckShoes> it's visual....
[1:46:13] <CappuccinoGuil> YUP
[1:46:14] <%hax_metatron> Failing is not always bad
[1:46:14] <%kyh9> ITS A FAILURE OF VISUAL CALCULUS
[1:46:15] <+IvesNapalm> You failed the check which is why it went that way
[1:46:17] <reonome> failling is GREAT
[1:46:17] <+AugiJr> CRITICAL FAIL
[1:46:18] <SolSwagGuy56> Not always :)
[1:46:18] <jorniev> FAILIURE makes it the oposite of what the skill does
[1:46:19] <linSP> failing skills = you‚Äôre racist
[1:46:20] <Blank9> failing is great
[1:46:21] <andre11dr> Just wait for " that" Endurance check
[1:46:21] <Oddere> you couldnt think of anything else to say
[1:46:21] <ainda_> check other dialogue options for bonusses just in case?
[1:46:23] <masterfire23> nah woolie he was activating his racistgan
[1:46:24] <$dudedude55555> 2 + 2 = ur black
[1:46:28] <DSD24> Failing gave you the Cock Carousel earlier
[1:46:29] <%Arnoldoaad1> Failing = bad confirmed
[1:46:29] <ingman112> Visual calculus is observational data. Which to a certain extent--especially when failing--can include race
[1:46:29] <twohitgood> I expected it to look for microexpressions.
[1:46:30] <+Walopoh> FAILURE IS RACISM
[1:46:30] <Broand> whaddya mean, you failed your way into a discount earlier
[1:46:30] <Blank9> did you forget failing Empathy?
[1:46:31] <derap41> Failing is fun Woolie
[1:46:31] <reonome> but woolie I thought you loved racism
[1:46:32] <+Vigonept> nah son
[1:46:33] <FassieFons> that was sake eyes level failure
[1:46:34] <%commanderclaw> Nope, failure is hyper failure
[1:46:35] <%gatorafan> Is the fact that was snake eyes have anything to do with it?
[1:46:37] <@Solidus_113> you thought?
[1:46:37] <StaticEntry> You saw something else Woolie lol
[1:46:40] <%Sunriser41> remember the cock carousel
[1:46:43] <+Vigonept> failure is bad person
[1:46:44] <Blank9> cock carousel came from empathy failure
[1:46:44] <$hattrick61> Nah, fail into outer space
[1:46:46] <Jp_DrZaius> WELCOME
[1:46:47] <Louie_Salmon> If chat integration was on we could help, just saying~
[1:46:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> damn so many cops seem fail their visual calculus checks then
[1:46:47] <dukenux> i don't get how failing visual calculus = racism
[1:46:48] <+FlubbedPig> No. It's the Attribute that fails.
[1:46:49] <%X2Eliah> Some fails are local, some fails are global
[1:46:51] <solaireprophet> STRAIGHT TO RACISM
[1:46:51] <mrapplebucks> nothing is safe
[1:46:53] <+MightyDuckShoes> technically he was just observing she was black.
[1:46:53] <AngryAsian5> You failed into a Cock Carousel earlier in the playthrough LUL
[1:46:53] <dukenux> with empathy it made sense
[1:46:53] <UvBenServed> COCK CAROSOUL
[1:46:54] <Jaysky> Cock carousel
[1:46:56] <nelsonsaysbooya> COCK CAROSEL
[1:46:56] <+DrSmashy> Failure is CONTENT
[1:46:56] <Lancaster_H> @gatorafan no, its fail or not. snake eyes is always fail even if its 99 percent
[1:46:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 1 and 2 first
[1:46:59] <+Damie904> Woolie her skintone is a visual
[1:46:59] <+Vigonept> all you see is a black woman
[1:47:00] <$emptyantics> WOOLIE ITS VISUAL
[1:47:00] <SolSwagGuy56> Remember the CAROUSEL?!?!
[1:47:02] <twohitgood> you fail into abject stupidity when you fail.
[1:47:03] <StaticEntry> Your analysis yielded different results
[1:47:05] <DasFreekman> Its establishing that we are always one degree of failure away from content
[1:47:06] <+Kataguro> You had a Gender Reveal Party and you burned half of California
[1:47:11] <+pupil31> LUL
[1:47:13] <begemp> The incel quest unlocked after a single failed empathy check too lol

[1:47:19] <+AugiJr> WOOLIE VS THE MUG
[1:47:19] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it's like the fail in real life is when your brain hits a tangent like, "Well... you know about what they say about THAT"
[1:47:19] <+IvesNapalm> It would be like shooting yourself in the foot Reggie
[1:47:20] <Johannen> @dukenux He observed that she had a different skin tone, how is that racist, dude does not know lwft from right at this point
[1:47:23] <mariothemaio> tbh racism is failing in the realm of politics tho

[1:49:13] <sushahana> role play btw
[1:49:14] <Canadian_Suit> it was just a crit fail
[1:49:14] <mrapplebucks> racism has been defeated
[1:49:15] <DSD24> See passing the check makes you avoid saying dumb shit
[1:49:15] <jorniev> racism can get WAY WORSE BTW
[1:49:17] <CarrotWhisky> Visual Calculus is fun.
[1:49:17] <reonome> are any of those things black
[1:49:20] <+NopeBadguy> You could've gone further

[1:49:45] <+Kataguro> VC is because you passed his check
[1:49:48] <DSD24> Shivers is the city though
[1:49:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Shivers isnt like that
[1:49:49] <CappuccinoGuil> No, because it's not about the city itself
[1:49:50] <Louie_Salmon> Not enough
[1:49:50] <+IvesNapalm> Nope, this all visual Calculus
[1:49:52] <derap41> Shivers is mental narratives
[1:49:52] <+Firgof> I expect that'd be more HalfLight
[1:49:53] <ingman112> The failure was a small detail; the success is big picture
[1:49:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> Shivers is gut feeling, this is deduction
[1:49:57] <+AugiJr> Shivers is like "Hum of the city"
[1:50:01] <ainda_> Youll get more Shivers, it will be good
[1:50:04] <%jinking79> imagine a 100% of success and still Fail

[1:51:09] <lyzejag> That line

[1:58:19] <%kewlmyc> NO
[1:58:19] <%X2Eliah> no

[1:58:22] <bonebagMEL> Only leveling
[1:58:22] <OkamiDude15> encyclopedia PogChamp

[1:58:24] <derap41> Cobinet
[1:58:25] <DSD24> That I don't know
[1:58:25] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Inland Empire is shite
[1:58:25] <superchunk121> No
[1:58:27] <oda_flobunaga> YES
[1:58:28] <derap41> Thought cabinet
[1:58:29] <+Kataguro> I don't think there's anything that boosts it, no
[1:58:29] <Zomner> no
[1:58:30] <pillowheadgirl> no theres not
[1:58:30] <+Vigonept> clothes dont help
[1:58:31] <AlbertoRobert> SOmetimes there are but not this one iirc
[1:58:31] <aiutare47> yes it is one of those checks
[1:58:31] <+FlubbedPig> Some Thoughts will open checks, but those take forever
[1:58:31] <+redyoshi5> you still need visual calculus for the foot prints
[1:58:32] <superchunk121> Only pump
[1:58:32] <BurlyBeef> points only
[1:58:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Guys at what point does the thing start talking to you when your inland is high?
[1:58:36] <ReganSenpai> Or at least do body before too many days pass
[1:58:37] <+undeadarchitect> Not true
[1:58:39] <pyshcocanuck> yes
[1:58:41] <$dudedude55555> you will get shit tons of levels anyway, you can always check the body later
[1:58:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:58:42] <ainda_> at least get Shivers to 4
[1:58:43] <tenshi_q> clothes don't re up checks
[1:58:43] <+Kataguro> Level what you want, Woolie
[1:58:45] <$dudedude55555> but it's cool dialog
[1:58:45] <ingman112> For some checks yes, but not this one
[1:58:46] <aiutare47> @TheRealGreaterGamer pretty high
[1:58:47] <skunk1324> sometimes new dialogue can reopen white checks
[1:58:48] <+undeadarchitect> Thought Cabinets unlock white checks
[1:58:48] <andre11dr> You need to pump it to get a second chance
[1:58:48] <ainda_> put points in Shivers
[1:58:49] <%hax_metatron> Woolie do Shivers
[1:58:50] <%hax_metatron> It's fine
[1:58:50] <LlewynMarie> i think the checks reset when you get to the next day
[1:58:50] <+AWKWARDL0SER> White checks repop from thoughts
[1:58:51] <+Kataguro> Boost Shivers then
[1:58:52] <+Vigonept> well pick it then
[1:58:52] <Louie_Salmon> You could do shivers now and that check later
[1:58:53] <%hax_metatron> IT"S FINE
[1:58:53] <ingman112> Do shivers!
[1:58:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> go with shivers, you can do the body later
[1:58:55] <SolSwagGuy56> Anyone else getting buffering?
[1:58:55] <Lancaster_H> @TheRealGreaterGamer if your iinland isnt hight at the start when you get it, never
[1:58:56] <ainda_> 4 is wehn you start to hear from it
[1:58:57] <%hax_metatron> DON'T HAVE TO DO BODY TODAY
[1:58:57] <+FlubbedPig> Pumping Inland will not guarantee you pass the check
[1:58:58] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You can always do that Inland check later
[1:58:59] <+Reverend_Roscoe> DO SHIVERS AND LEVEL UP LATER
[1:58:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus There are other ways, but you won't know that until they happen.
[1:59:00] <ingman112> Do what you want
[1:59:00] <+Firgof> 4 - Quiet, 6 - Moderate, 8 - Loud, 10 - Delibilitatingly Loud, 12+ - Actual Insanity Voice
[1:59:01] <legion0047> shivers plez
[1:59:02] <TheRealGreaterGamer> DAMN
[1:59:02] <Canadian_Suit> absolutely correct
[1:59:05] <+Vivaciousx3> then pick it and do some side quests
[1:59:05] <Blank9> you haven't missed shivers because it's low, it doesn't say much
[1:59:06] <ainda_> there is plenty of xp
[1:59:06] <andre11dr> You can get more Shivers or another roll
[1:59:07] <pyshcocanuck> You'll get a chance later either way
[1:59:07] <%BusterRepukken> just save before it
[1:59:08] <+charp35> save first
[1:59:09] <nakunattakage> you can find a fair few clothes that buff up shivers
[1:59:09] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Lancaster_H DAMN That sucks
[1:59:12] <%kewlmyc> Save first then
[1:59:12] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus GET SHIVERS MAXED
[1:59:13] <LlewynMarie> get shivers
[1:59:14] <+FlubbedPig> Let's get Shivery
[1:59:14] <@Solidus_113> maximum scum
[1:59:16] <Zomner> yeah, that would suck
[1:59:16] <+icekept> save scum it
[1:59:18] <%X2Eliah> savescum it
[1:59:18] <oda_flobunaga> Reload if necessary
[1:59:19] <+Kataguro> You will level up again soon. Just level what you want
[1:59:19] <BigManLugan> save scum
[1:59:20] <andre11dr> If you fail it just reload
[1:59:23] <Dio_TR> Them maybe you should have spec into PHSYSICAL THE LUL
[1:59:23] <+DrSmashy> just save scum
[1:59:25] <ingman112> @WoolieVersus Just do Shivers and save it for later
[1:59:26] <+Vigonept> well just pick shivers
[1:59:26] <zhukis> Have the universe help you with the rolls?
[1:59:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> get shivers if you want, the body can be done later
[1:59:26] <%kewlmyc> No one will blame you for save scumming
[1:59:28] <%andrewofbob> You save scummed one roll, just bitch save more
[1:59:29] <$dudedude55555> what if you pop inland and say "you're black" again
[1:59:31] <LlewynMarie> shivers is a lot more fun
[1:59:32] <Lancaster_H> @TheRealGreaterGamer yeah i figured it out like 30 hrs into my game, but hey, replay value
[1:59:35] <Johannen> Level up what you want, you can always get inland for that check later
[1:59:35] <sushahana> min maxing is bad for this game
[1:59:35] <+NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus Also, consider examining your ledger further.
[1:59:36] <FassieFons> scum it, content > courage
[1:59:36] <$hattrick61> Just save scum weve all done it
[1:59:38] <%hax_metatron> Woolie you don't have to do body today
[1:59:39] <ainda_> THere's plenty of XP in the game, don't let people bully you
[1:59:39] <+Firgof> 20 Encyclopedia is just 'Please spam my chat box forever with trivia on *absolutely everything*'
[1:59:40] <iacus_> i hope he gets the sho
[1:59:43] <%gatorafan> @kewlmyc just like a few minutes ago Kappa
[1:59:43] <iacus_> nope
[1:59:44] <%alpharius88> you could ask universe for help with the twitch integration
[1:59:46] <DSD24> Thats fair Woolie
[1:59:49] <iacus_> shivers too low?
[1:59:51] <andre11dr> Inland Empire is pretty fun in general tho
[1:59:51] <ingman112> Good compromise
[1:59:54] <+AWKWARDL0SER> You‚Äôve already popped your save scum cherry...become a scum sl...never mind
[1:59:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> TWITCH INTEGRATION TIME?
[1:59:58] <+dalmek> that works as a compromise
[1:59:59] <available_line> You'll have plenty of level ups for shivers.
[1:59:59] <die_hardman> You can do body day 2, no problem
[2:00:09] <$Ralfclogs> Put into shivers and come back later

[2:01:38] <+Vigonept> ya havent even read it yet
[2:01:38] <bonebagMEL> This is the setting
[2:01:38] <mariothemaio> shivers is based
[2:01:39] <+elhafnero> s h i v e r s
[2:01:39] <+NopeBadguy> You should consider examining your ledger further as there's a lot of great writing in there.
[2:01:42] <sushahana> BEST SKILL ALERT
[2:01:49] <+Kataguro> This is one of the best bits in the game
[2:01:51] <$dudedude55555> you're gonna change your tune once you pass the body check
[2:01:51] <laserbeaming> quite lucky. That requires Shivers 4 and rain
[2:01:56] <iacus_> yeah
[2:01:56] <ingman112> @NopeBadguy Best for later at night, when time doesn't matter
[2:02:01] <iacus_> so they had to have it at 4
[2:02:03] <iacus_> so glad they did
[2:02:04] <derap41> Mental map unlocked
[2:02:07] <+Mendin> Here it comes
[2:02:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> humid and cold is literally the worst possible weather
[2:02:32] <%X2Eliah> @ReallyBigRocks naw thats just normal
[2:02:38] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Shit like this is why I want to do a modded all 20 playthrough

[2:02:48] <dukenux> FeelsBadMan
[2:02:49] <aiutare47> @WoolieVersus You passed a difficult and time/weather dependent passive check immediately. Thats weirdly crazy luck
[2:02:54] <+Firgof> @TheRealGreaterGamer don't do it, it's actual misery
[2:02:57] <+Kataguro> Good, he's checking it all. Pat skipped ahead in this part
[2:03:03] <$emptyantics> Goddamn. shivers is great
[2:03:05] <bonebagMEL> @TheRealGreaterGamer All your mind doesn't stop talking, is unbearable
[2:03:06] <+Firgof> It's like being Sherlock Holmes -- too much information, all the time, about everything
[2:03:10] <Crippl3> the saddest church
[2:03:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Firgof Why? I want IT ALL
[2:03:28] <+Zhwoobatte> it would take hours

[2:03:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> YOU GUYS CANT STOP ME WISH ME LUCK
[2:03:51] <$emptyantics> FeelsBadMan
[2:04:08] <FassieFons> god DAMN this is good prose Kreygasm
[2:04:27] <Crippl3> Reggie is feeling it
[2:04:29] <+Firgof> "I got twenty minutes into all 20 and I've completely lost every thread of the story and know far too much about trivial economic fare of Revachol"
[2:04:31] <%hax_metatron> PASSIVES!
[2:04:31] <+Walopoh> LUL
[2:04:32] <srv4254> yeyeye
[2:04:34] <Zomner> LUL
[2:04:35] <pyshcocanuck> Shivers is great
[2:04:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yep
[2:04:37] <ingman112> So IMMEDIATELY
[2:04:38] <Louie_Salmon> I mean you could get this whenever
[2:04:44] <Indigo_Automaton> Shivers is fantastic
[2:04:46] <+Kataguro> Shivers is here to validate your choices
[2:04:47] <+Mrbaconator> do you have SHIVERS
[2:04:48] <+FlubbedPig> Feel it up your spine, baby. Shivers
[2:04:49] <aiutare47> it was crazy luck, this a super specific check
[2:04:51] <iacus_> LOVE TI
[2:04:55] <+Firgof> Shivers gives you the "Noir Detective Background Music"
[2:04:55] <iacus_> it*
[2:04:55] <GarbageNirvana> And this is why you don't listen to the universe all the time
[2:04:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I never got this because I had a 1 in phys lmao
[2:04:56] <+projectmanatees> pat did tell you it was even numbers
[2:05:00] <+Vigonept> it was weather and time dependant so very lucky
[2:05:00] <$hattrick61> Woolie: 1 Chat: 0
[2:05:00] <LlewynMarie> the game really wants you understand where you are
[2:05:00] <%krispen_wa> hes never gonna check that body out of spite now
[2:05:10] <primaryfire> even numbered stats trigger stuff
[2:05:13] <%kyh9> I NEVER NOTICED THAT DETAILS
[2:05:23] <jorniev> he can always make that check later
[2:05:34] <+Kataguro> The skies falling, baby
[2:05:37] <%X2Eliah> thing is, that body check is also pretty good
[2:05:38] <GarbageNirvana> If he misses stuff, he misses stuff. He's gonna miss stuff anyway because of how stats work in this game
[2:05:39] <andre11dr> The truth is that it didn't matter, you would've gotten this eventually, and you still need to level up Inland Empire, if you want the dialogue
[2:05:45] <%hax_metatron> Shivers is True Detective
[2:05:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:05:45] <CappuccinoGuil> FLEX
[2:05:46] <+FlubbedPig> The whole game is just a writer going off
[2:05:47] <+Mendin> Shivers -is- listening to the universe. We're just a voice in their head
[2:05:47] <jorniev> WORLD BUILDING
[2:05:49] <Indigo_Automaton> he GOES
[2:05:51] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Its God basically giving you spoilers on the world LUL
[2:05:52] <Dio_TR> GO OFF KING
[2:05:54] <primaryfire> shivers is the writer just GOING
[2:05:58] <$emptyantics> SHIVER IS GOAT
[2:05:58] <Canadian_Suit> @WoolieVersus now go max SHIVERS
[2:05:59] <+Kataguro> The macroscope
[2:06:01] <Blank9> encyclopedia does this more
[2:06:08] <ingman112> I will say, there's a section of this dialogue you can only get on Day 1. So Woolie doing this now is actually fantastic
[2:06:10] <spaceitaly> Inland is the psyche of yourself, Shivers is the psyche of the world
[2:06:12] <%X2Eliah> Encyclopedia is mostly boring tho
[2:06:18] <derap41> Shivers is just a mental narrative its entirely imagination
[2:06:19] <available_line> Narrator Cop
[2:06:32] <+Kataguro> Here we go
[2:06:34] <Zomner> JAMROCK
[2:06:34] <Dio_TR> HERE IT COMES
[2:06:35] <+MightyDuckShoes> here it comes
[2:06:38] <nakunattakage> it's not actually just imagination
[2:06:38] <+Firgof> Not *entirely* imagination. It just feels like it is and isn't.
[2:06:39] <+Mendin> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:06:43] <%X2Eliah> @derap41 eeehhh no
[2:06:43] <+rainlily1245> given the nature of this setting, i'd reckon shivers is actually real

[2:11:26] <+Vigonept> even numbers
[2:11:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Aim for even numbers.
[2:11:32] <%Frostilk> the game really went from -100 to 100 in a really short amount of time LUL
[2:11:34] <reonome> where the hood at.
[2:11:35] <aiutare47> @WoolieVersus Its a really specific passive check that only triggers when you pass a dice roll in front of the Whirling while it rains. AND YOU GOT IT INSTANTLY
[2:11:36] <+Mendin> @TheRealGreaterGamer You belong to the city
[2:11:36] <+Soliloquy123> Romanticizing a shitty city is like the coolest thing ever unironically
[2:11:36] <dmtjinni> LUL
[2:11:36] <spaceitaly> it gets better ;^)
[2:11:37] <Louie_Salmon> Okay but you don't know

[2:12:02] <sushahana> inland still works on body even when its down
[2:12:08] <$dudedude55555> you don't even know yet, woolie, that's just a taste
[2:12:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, don't neglect clothing choices too. Always swap if you can for a white check.
[2:12:10] <LlewynMarie> Shivers and Esprit de Corps are the best in the game
[2:12:13] <ReganSenpai> fate said it was time for shivers
[2:12:15] <OkamiDude15> we'll get the body down after woolie maxes out shivers Kappa
[2:12:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> I got a few on my phys 1 playthrough but Im sad I never got that because of how HELPFUL that would have been
[2:12:29] <+EmptyMug> Use the car radio
[2:12:30] <mariothemaio> go find the smoker!
[2:12:31] <derap41> Now Imagine if you would have been racist cop
[2:12:34] <+undeadarchitect> DMX Cleanse saves the day
[2:12:35] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just pure exposition
[2:12:35] <andre11dr> Inland Empire and Shivers are my favourites

[2:12:59] <%krispen_wa> time stops at 2am
[2:13:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Kim said to talk to the smoker tomorrow.
[2:13:01] <andre11dr> Also Electro Chemistry is really cool if you go hard on the drugs
[2:13:02] <+mczarklesby> There's a doorbell on that other door you can mess with.
[2:13:07] <die_hardman> You can stop at 2 AM
[2:13:09] <GarbageNirvana> Can you find the smoker on the same day?
[2:13:11] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Kim is cool
[2:13:13] <+Firgof> Authority / HalfLight / HandEye for 'I'm Judge Dredd'
[2:13:16] <AvroEltz> Kim will only go to bed when you go to bed
[2:13:19] <sushahana> caps lock turn on run for default
[2:13:22] <Blank9> every stat is cool, except endurance and pain threshold
[2:13:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @GarbageNirvana no, but they do have the key and can go inside the apartments.
[2:13:31] <Darren716> You should be able to sing DMX now
[2:13:34] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Pain Threshold only really kinda helped me sit in a chair.
[2:13:35] <Darren716> I mean he exists
[2:13:58] <+Mrbaconator> SHOOK
[2:13:59] <+luftraumm1> that shivers dialogue is only rivaled by aces low
[2:14:00] <Indigo_Automaton> You mean Inland
[2:14:02] <+Mendin> Vox Polis
[2:14:06] <ainda_> Pain Threshold gives you a lot and a diversity if you put a lot in it, it was good for me bouncing off Emp and Half light, but yeah doesn't chime in otherwise
[2:14:07] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Woolie has fallen in love with Shivers. Good.
[2:14:16] <derap41> Lot of missing pets
[2:14:18] <Blank9> this song rules
[2:14:21] <LlewynMarie> good music
[2:14:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Hey, guess what? THIS SONG RULES
[2:14:22] <superchunk121> 2nd Best song in the game right here
[2:14:25] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[2:14:26] <andre11dr> Composer, Half Light, Physical Instrument, Visual Calculus is the Jotaro playstyle
[2:14:27] <available_line> This is the second best song in the game
[2:14:35] <Yung_FckUp> brb im gonna stand outside in the cold
[2:14:37] <+undeadarchitect> this track fucks
[2:14:37] <$emptyantics> SourPls
[2:14:42] <OkamiDude15> @Indigo_Automaton inland set it up and shivers said sang the next verse
[2:14:42] <MemMoor> this song always struck me as being very silent hill
[2:14:42] <+SealOfKoalaTea> I was a deranged Superstar cop, and proudly so
[2:14:49] <+Kataguro> Kim's Shivers stat is pretty low too
[2:14:52] <ainda_> Kim will...suprise you
[2:14:59] <+NopeBadguy> Kim is professional to a fault.
[2:15:08] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Kim clearly has no points in Shivers
[2:15:08] <derap41> Disco Glasses
[2:15:13] <Indigo_Automaton> @Indigo_Automaton Oh yeah, right. I meant Inland came in with the first
[2:15:32] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Woolie is playing a GIANT NERD hahaha
[2:15:44] <aiutare47> God I hate rich folks
[2:15:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> Hunter S thompson glasses?
[2:15:58] <muXPerience> binoclard cops
[2:16:03] <+FlubbedPig> authority's a dick anyway
[2:16:05] <Johannen> Even number Logic
[2:16:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Even numbers are good
[2:16:11] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Woolie has a high cap on his Shivers, did he go Hobo cop?
[2:16:13] <laserbeaming> 6 is good
[2:16:15] <ainda_> you can always take them off at the end of the day
[2:16:17] <dukenux> Binoclad Bros
[2:16:18] <derap41> Yea these are not for you
[2:16:26] <SomeAsianDood> yes @sealofkoalatea
[2:16:30] <+SealOfKoalaTea> niiice
[2:16:32] <%Deft_Thought> @SealOfKoalaTea His Shivers is his primary stat too
[2:16:37] <derap41> Shame cause they're cool and you can wear them while Making PISS
[2:16:39] <DatAsuna> Dr Unrespect
[2:16:39] <Blank9> authority rules
[2:16:44] <%Deft_Thought> Specialization or whatever
[2:16:44] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Shivers really is the best skill in terms of being fun and gettin cool stuff
[2:16:55] <Eger007> esprit de courps is a lot like shivers
[2:16:58] <%Deft_Thought> Inland does some neat stuff
[2:17:00] <Blank9> it has very few times it gets into conversations though.
[2:17:11] <SomeAsianDood> inland is also strong
[2:17:13] <derap41> @Eger007 Its mainly to feel out Kim
[2:17:26] <derap41> B&E Cop
[2:17:27] <+undeadarchitect> RCM Open Up!!!
[2:17:31] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Espirit De Corps lets you know what the other cops are up to, and is an entire side story basically.
[2:17:35] <+IvesNapalm> Woolie not even knocking
[2:17:42] <Lancaster_H> @derap41 not quite, esprit has more shivers like dialogue than shivers
[2:17:44] <ainda_> Espirit de Corps is more like, lets you sense comradery
[2:17:45] <iacus_> room 1 is your room at the whirling
[2:17:45] <dmtjinni> THE GOOD ROOM
[2:17:46] <laserbeaming> Room #1 is your room at the Whirling
[2:17:46] <aiutare47> room one is Whirling
[2:17:47] <Nullseven> Tools
[2:17:50] <ainda_> and the connections between comrades
[2:17:50] <Indigo_Automaton> tools
[2:18:04] <iacus_> or now that savescumming is on, you can do that
[2:18:05] <derap41> I guess it works for the Crew too
[2:18:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Cash money
[2:18:22] <ingman112> Savescumming for accidental racism seems fair to me
[2:18:25] <Blackleafx> come to boogie street
[2:18:26] <Eger007> @derap41 not only kim, the whole pre41. it actually carries a lot of information
[2:18:39] <+SealOfKoalaTea> @ingman112 yeah i save scummed hard there.
[2:18:50] <+SealOfKoalaTea> i said a bad to kim

[2:21:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh check your objectives on the right
[2:21:12] <GarbageNirvana> Weird

[2:21:19] <+KillerCrocomire> because your a communist
[2:21:19] <+IvesNapalm> Communism is dead, you are the last, and the thought is painful
[2:21:20] <%Deft_Thought> The Death of hope feels bad
[2:21:21] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> exactly
[2:21:21] <ingman112> The latter
[2:21:22] <srv4254> yes
[2:21:22] <OkamiDude15> you? no comrade, we.
[2:21:22] <%X2Eliah> Because communism died
[2:21:23] <aiutare47> You took the communist thought

[2:21:29] <Indigo_Automaton> BIG OL' COMMUNARDS
[2:21:30] <ingman112> Because it exists in your thought cabinet, you get dialogue for it

[2:21:34] <$hattrick61> Coomunisum
[2:21:35] <slimdink> why does the detective, the biggest communism builder, not simply devour the liberals?
[2:21:38] <gunsrlove> Watch tho, big ideologists usually go on the firing line when the new socialist govt. takes over
[2:21:42] <Oddere> you get dialogue choices if its in your cabinet at all regardless of if you're internalising
[2:21:48] <DemonDude656> demond35F demond35F demond35F
[2:21:48] <buffcat> the revolution failed
[2:21:49] <aiutare47> no but you took the "quest"
[2:21:51] <iacus_> you took a morale hit because you got sad thatr communism failed
[2:21:51] <+Vigonept> nah its a part of you now
[2:21:52] <laserbeaming> in your journal, you can check how many times you selected Commie dialogues
[2:21:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> check your objectives real quick, on the right is a log
[2:21:59] <Oddere> revachol has kind of had every form of goverment and each one has failed
[2:22:02] <+IvesNapalm> You don't have to internalize the thought for it to effect you, merely having it does
[2:22:08] <Johannen> @laserbeaming That only shows up later
[2:22:12] <+SealOfKoalaTea> @Oddere thats a cool thing about it

[2:22:28] <mariothemaio> ENLIGHTENED CENTRIST
[2:22:29] <KernelButter> Just accepting the thought will make the game consider that your political belief
[2:22:29] <Johannen> @laserbeaming I guess they unlocked it with that ledger examination
[2:22:29] <+rainlily1245> no centrists go die
[2:22:31] <%notsoy> 3 killed? wow when did that happen?
[2:22:31] <begemp> It doesn't mean much

[2:22:39] <GarbageNirvana> Moralist is the lowest
[2:22:39] <%X2Eliah> Yeah sure go balance it xD
[2:22:40] <lyzejag> NO BALANCE, ONLY COMMUNIST
[2:22:41] <mariothemaio> BALANCE COMMUNISM WITH FACISM LUL LUL LUL
[2:22:42] <dmtjinni> LUL
[2:22:43] <+SealOfKoalaTea> No Superstar cop? Not very Disco of you.

[2:22:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Moralist is surprisingly low LUL
[2:22:49] <dukenux> balance it out with... fascism? then you'll just make a nazbol
[2:22:55] <ingman112> Good to explore those options, at least
[2:23:02] <FassieFons> communism AND fascism or fuck off
[2:23:05] <iacus_> You unlock that with the holographic badge
[2:23:06] <dukenux> Moralist 1 LUL
[2:23:06] <Indigo_Automaton> At least you aren't boring
[2:23:06] <ainda_> plz dont balance it with fascism
[2:23:13] <ainda_> there are those other 2, nobody does Moralist
[2:23:13] <srv4254> add a little fascism for good measure
[2:23:17] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Yes, it will balance out and not totally make you seem like a hypocrite loonball :)
[2:23:18] <%kyh9> balance it WITH FASCISM
[2:23:19] <CappuccinoGuil> HOLY FUCK! Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance rerelease!
[2:23:19] <squidmax1> Calling it now, Woolie is going to be a moralist cop
[2:23:25] <+Pequod1> even things out? more like max communism baybee
[2:23:25] <spaceitaly> this entire game is about pumping up that cases solved meter by one whole point
[2:23:26] <+Firgof> Ultraliberal Communism
[2:23:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i never understood, in this game what is ultraliberal compared to moralist?
[2:23:27] <+zepelinnn1> "noooooo dont pick the option i disklike BabyRage "
[2:23:27] <FassieFons> horse shoe baby
[2:23:28] <mariothemaio> true centrism is being fascist and communist at the same time, this is true
[2:23:31] <andre11dr> How does one have a 3 in ultraliberalism AND FASCISM
[2:23:34] <tenshi_q> balance with fascism but then realise you LOVE the fascism
[2:23:35] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus So you want to be a Fascist Communist do you? Pretty sure there is a name for that
[2:23:36] <derap41> Then a Buffee!
[2:23:38] <%Deft_Thought> Hell yeah
[2:23:40] <LeotheHuntsman> I wish any streamer did the fascism paths they're hilarious
[2:23:45] <+IvesNapalm> A fascist communist cop might just be the worst combination
[2:23:50] <%hax_metatron> RONA WutFace
[2:23:51] <nakunattakage> they really aren't hilarious
[2:23:53] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Woolie the communist

[2:24:10] <ainda_> with a shitty ass broom to
[2:24:16] <derap41> He pretends he isn't but he is
[2:24:31] <%bread_assassin> @LeotheHuntsman Yeah, pretty much every single person i see goes communist, with moralist being a distant second.
[2:24:35] <$hattrick61> @cobalt_phoenix_ moralist is agressively centrist, ultraliberal is ruthless capitalism
[2:24:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @hattrick61 ah ok thanks
[2:24:50] <GarbageNirvana> fuckin old people
[2:24:51] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Disco Superstar is the only moral choice I respect

[2:25:52] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus So shivers is the one stat that you can pump to 10+ without problems
[2:26:07] <aiutare47> *because it has barely any checks anyway
[2:26:07] <Blank9> please no
[2:26:15] <buffcat> theres a lot of clothes that boost shivers in this game
[2:26:24] <+SealOfKoalaTea> shivers is just flat out cool
[2:26:24] <mariothemaio> be nice to granny :(
[2:26:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> She doesn't talk to anyone, don't you remember? She's rusty with talking
[2:26:34] <+SealOfKoalaTea> I also like Electro Chem due to it being a horrid drug fiend
[2:26:46] <laserbeaming> don't worry, probably no one talks to her. It said even her speech is rusty
[2:26:48] <+SealOfKoalaTea> its funny
[2:26:54] <$hattrick61> see if this old lady has a pin you can steal
[2:27:04] <Jonny_Uppercut> @SealOfKoalaTea And a horrid sex fiend, don't forget that too

[2:54:03] <yuribo26> ANCAP aka people who defend loli porn on twitter
[2:54:04] <Crippl3> TEMPORARY
[2:54:04] <dukenux> ancap where "An" is a suggestion
[2:54:05] <CappuccinoGuil> Woolie, it's a temporary -2
[2:54:05] <sporeian94> EVERY DAY I'M HUSSLIN
[2:54:05] <JiReN_TheGray_> nice! @DSD24
[2:54:05] <NeroInfinite> thats the temp bonus LUL
[2:54:06] <nakunattakage> only while you're researching it though
[2:54:06] <aiutare47> "side-bitch ideology" is a fucking great phrase though
[2:54:07] <derap41> no bonus until you internalize it
[2:54:07] <NeekoFM> ancaps have empathy
[2:54:07] <crunchington001> Aw yeah just go ancap
[2:54:07] <Blank9> that's the research penalty, it changes when you finish
[2:54:09] <$emptyantics> ANCAP LMAO
[2:54:09] <SolSwagGuy56> LUL
[2:54:11] <DatAsuna> I know an ancap person and they're... very intense about it.
[2:54:12] <Johannen> Temporary for the research time
[2:54:12] <oda_flobunaga> -2 empathy fo 1 H 45 min
[2:54:12] <%Deft_Thought> Doesn't take long to internalize though
[2:54:13] <+trackles_64> child labor
[2:54:13] <reonome> its temporary
[2:54:13] <laguerrilha> temporary -2 until its done
[2:54:14] <Estwilde> side-bitch ideology is a strong set of words
[2:54:15] <BurlyBeef> It's only a temporary -2
[2:54:19] <DatAsuna> They literally never stop talking about it
[2:54:20] <CappuccinoGuil> TEMPORARY debuff
[2:54:22] <+walternatorz> those are the negatives while learning
[2:54:24] <crunchington001> Who are you to tell me that I can't own a rocket launcher?
[2:54:26] <Blank9> every thought has temporary research debuffs
[2:54:27] <Lancaster_H> TEMPORARY
[2:54:29] <andre11dr> Also i totally lined HARD in this direction, i did this and the actual Anarchism thoughts
[2:54:29] <+DrSmashy> temporary debuff
[2:54:30] <derap41> Its a temporary punishment
[2:54:32] <%bread_assassin> -2 empathy is only the TEMP bonus.
[2:54:32] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> make sure you lock them inside so they can't run away during fires
[2:54:36] <+IvesNapalm> Woolie those are research penalties, they go away once they are internalized
[2:54:37] <pi_in_the_sci> once you finish the thought they get better
[2:54:38] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus that Debuff is only Temporary
[2:54:41] <+PkSilent01> Those Negative are Temporary
[2:54:45] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus Some of the better ideas only give +s when the idea is complete
[2:54:51] <nakunattakage> it transforms when finished
[2:54:52] <derap41> 2 hours then you unlock the real bonus
[2:54:55] <laserbeaming> that's how thoughts works. You get the real bonus once you solve it
[2:54:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that's during it being internalized
[2:54:59] <laserbeaming> Reggie gets it
[2:54:59] <thebalticguy1> The full research bonuses are different
[2:55:02] <Blank9> cursed taxation
[2:55:02] <Ids560> it doesn't tell you what it turns into
[2:55:05] <CappuccinoGuil> All thoughts have a temporary effect, then they unlock something new once it's completed.

[3:10:10] <%HeroToxiko> Thats what it looks like when the city "revitalizes" a low income community with deluxe condos
[3:10:13] <mark_collins45> In New York.
[3:10:16] <Oakydeer> Dude, Candyman rips.
[3:10:21] <Estwilde> Yeah because her apartment was always cold, the other apartment had no windows
[3:10:22] <OlavOlavsson> She felt a breeze coming thru the mirror, that's how she found out.
[3:10:27] <Estwilde> And all the cold air went in thru her bathroom
[3:10:28] <+Kataguro> Flashlight might help

[3:12:48] <%X2Eliah> OTHER SIDE
[3:12:52] <paaadaawan> Ahh I see
[3:12:52] <$dudedude55555> i can't read
[3:13:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> More tare for cash money
[3:13:18] <Oakydeer> I love the sound it makes when you pick up tare
[3:13:30] <andre11dr> @dudedude55555 Than how did you answer to what i wrote?
[3:13:38] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Woolie Vs Disco is the perfect background noise for cleaning my house up
[3:13:50] <%X2Eliah> It's pretty great how the only place that you can sell tare at, also sells booze
[3:13:57] <ainda_> bodies
[3:13:58] <$dudedude55555> @andre11dr how can you be sure I did, maybe your mind is playing tricks again
[3:14:08] <aiutare47> 9-12 is HUGE
[3:14:09] <andre11dr> Hmmm maybe
[3:14:10] <nakunattakage> limesFeels
[3:14:35] <chainsaw105> as they should
[3:14:50] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Oh shit, they're finding lore i missed in my run!!!
[3:14:59] <sushahana> B I G
[3:15:10] <derap41> Those are some Big shells
[3:15:13] <+OblivionSword1> more point to put into Shiver
[3:15:18] <Parapattern> Big warcrimes
[3:15:20] <%X2Eliah> Warships still on the horizon
[3:15:24] <%X2Eliah> Thats heavy
[3:15:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wow
[3:15:31] <ChungusQuest> Peace under the big guns
[3:15:34] <DSD24> 58 seconds to live
[3:15:39] <dukenux> that's encyclopedia for you
[3:15:52] <+OblivionSword1> put more point into shiver
[3:15:59] <Broand> that's 7 nation army
[3:16:02] <aiutare47> empathy or visual calc
[3:16:02] <%X2Eliah> Inland?
[3:16:05] <%hax_metatron> Inland?
[3:16:05] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Revachol is wounded, broken, and dying, but i love her so
[3:16:06] <derap41> Indirect mode tho
[3:16:09] <+NopeBadguy> One more crack at Inland
[3:16:10] <CappuccinoGuil> Visual Calculus would unlock a GREAT check
[3:16:13] <DSD24> Shivers only playthough
[3:16:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i feed my shivers she grows big and strong
[3:16:16] <iacus_> you could do inland now, or save the pt
[3:16:16] <%HeroToxiko> that is what seven nation army is about
[3:16:17] <ainda_> waiting for a second was good advice from pat
[3:16:19] <+NopeBadguy> Did the stream die?
[3:16:19] <ingman112> Volition is an excellent choice, as is Inland
[3:16:20] <dukenux> inland's cool too
[3:16:20] <+FlubbedPig> Volition is important
[3:16:20] <Zomner> Volition only at two :(
[3:16:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1389465211585896451?s=20
[3:16:22] <+Kataguro> More Volition wouldn't be a bad idea. Maybe Perception
[3:16:22] <aiutare47> Visual calc for a check you missed as well
[3:16:23] <sushahana> min maxing is trash
[3:16:24] <Indigo_Automaton> Inland
[3:16:24] <skunk1324> volition is great
[3:16:25] <+SealOfKoalaTea> @HeroToxiko a song by Jack White
[3:16:26] <Blank9> get some even numbers
[3:16:27] <@Solidus_113> Visual at 6 would be nice
[3:16:28] <CappuccinoGuil> There's a Visual Calculus check you failed last time.
[3:16:30] <X2Eliah> Volition is 3
[3:16:32] <+sevorai> Volition for the GREATEST line in the game
[3:16:33] <thebalticguy1> Avoid spreading yourself too thin
[3:16:34] <derap41> Thoughts are worth way more than stats
[3:16:37] <iacus_> you will get more opportunities for shivers
[3:16:38] <ChrisFailsAt> Inland Empire is fun shit
[3:16:41] <Lancaster_H> 4-5 doesnt do much, even numbers are more important @WoolieVersus
[3:16:42] <%HeroToxiko> @SealOfKoalaTea i know, i loved it
[3:16:42] <ainda_> Inland is also just cool anyone if ur learning that way
[3:16:44] <ingman112> Volition is also normally at 3, lowered 1 right now b/c of Morale damage
[3:16:44] <primaryfire> volition is a good boy
[3:16:46] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Shivers is your secret bro
[3:16:49] <aiutare47> but you missed a check
[3:16:53] <CappuccinoGuil> You failed an important Visual check last time. A point would unlock it.
[3:16:54] <Blank9> you already are going to get most shivers
[3:16:56] <+blaze__drag> Just so you know, having a 4 in a stat is generally the point when it starts popping up a lot in passives
[3:16:59] <+FlubbedPig> Volition's a good man. The voice of reason.
[3:17:00] <+samuraiknack> Esprit
[3:17:02] <+OblivionSword1> don't forget to heal your morale
[3:17:07] <Nullseven> Inland is the bomb
[3:17:15] <+OblivionSword1> you have 5 morale heal
[3:17:17] <+SealOfKoalaTea> @OblivionSword1 nah, he's fine at 2
[3:17:20] <primaryfire> even numbered stats are important for passives. 2, 4, 6, 8 etc
[3:17:21] <$dudedude55555> inland empire is like shivers, but for your mind
[3:17:25] <+SealOfKoalaTea> hold the heal for when you need it
[3:17:27] <derap41> yeah moral health is fine
[3:17:27] <Indigo_Automaton> Heal a morale
[3:17:28] <available_line> You can only put 3 points into Inland anyway, might as well "max" it then put the rest into Shivers.
[3:17:29] <+Bitscreed> Pop some of that Magnesium.
[3:17:32] <+NopeBadguy> There are enough healing items in the game you don't need to worry about health pools
[3:17:37] <iacus_> it would be good to heal morale now yeah
[3:17:38] <emeraldskrull> woolieTRASH_SG woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[3:17:48] <ulcaban> Hi Cindy

[3:17:55] <+FlubbedPig> Hooves are quite good at climbing actually. Ever seen a goat?
[3:17:56] <+SealOfKoalaTea> there is literally no reason to heal morale now, other than having a full meter.
[3:18:05] <mariothemaio> wow people are so mean to cops, wonder why LUL

[3:35:30] <derap41> @ingman112 it is implied that she turns tricks

[3:37:47] <Estwilde> I always liked big league chew

[3:38:03] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Double Bubble is the shit, i used to blow bubbles the size of my head with two pieces.
[3:38:09] <+athuramn> it's to show that encyclopedia, for all its facts, has an obscure feeling towards the wrapper

[3:45:38] <laserbeaming> @the_angelon_experience interestingly, Bayonetta's guns are called Scabarough Fair as a whole. Each gun has a name: Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. I guess Kamiya likes old english folk songs or Simon and Garfunkel.

[3:47:58] <ReganSenpai> my gut is telling me to save scum the check
[3:48:07] <%thetunnelhomer> Oh, did he get another corpse attempt from Cuno?
[3:48:15] <available_line> Can you still INLAND the corpse?
[3:48:18] <Blank9> You can debrief with Kim on the hotel balcony, but just wanna do that before sleep.
[3:48:21] <+NopeBadguy> If you have not much else to do, this is also a great time to read more of your ledger
[3:48:26] <ingman112> Did he level up Inland? If not no point
[3:48:37] <ReganSenpai> he has a spare point
[3:48:40] <dukenux> he never was in that book store, was he?
[3:48:42] <laserbeaming> @Blackleafx I think chat means certain action woolie just did unlocked the check.
[3:48:47] <%nintega010> cuno doesn't sleep
[3:48:53] <+athuramn> yeah, the ledger is worth going into earlier rather than later

[3:49:01] <available_line> Cuno is too high to sleep.
[3:49:02] <Lancaster_H> might also wanna check the buzzer on the apartment door next to the backyard @WoolieVersus
[3:49:04] <skunk1324> has he solved the tracks in the mud?
[3:49:04] <dukenux> loading batteries
[3:49:06] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Kuno doesn't need sleep, he has drugs

[3:56:48] <%Arnoldoaad1> You might want to try
[3:56:48] <muXPerience> doing <return> at state 0 versus doing it at state 1 has two different voices but only one text entry
[3:56:51] <+Kataguro> I'd try it
[3:56:58] <user_naim> Either or is fine
[3:56:59] <+luftraumm1> woolie you still have long to go
[3:57:04] <ingman112> I'd say, since it's getting late, check out the ledger then retire with kim

[4:20:35] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, you can swerve into the ocean a LOT in this game
[4:20:36] <aiutare47> chat doesnt fucking up the red check hurt things kinda bad?
[4:20:36] <balthazar758> double down towards earth's core
[4:20:38] <the_angelon_experience> Hijinks Over Heaven
[4:20:39] <+SealOfKoalaTea> You can shoot him down, or do another thing...
[4:20:41] <ingman112> Do what you're gonna do. I wouldn't shoot the body unless you were already planning on it
[4:20:41] <andre11dr> I'm ok if you even save scum the shot
[4:20:42] <+Fnir> About that...
[4:20:43] <Blank9> you hit a kid while offroading
[4:20:45] <linSP> you can also fuck with clothing if you have it
[4:20:48] <Monkeyweed21> @Broand he saved after talking to the corpse
[4:20:48] <jorniev> this game is like that
[4:20:51] <%alpharius88> its a game over shoot cunoesse
[4:20:52] <%gitgouda> just saying though, she was ASKING for it.
[4:20:53] <iacus_> "swerve into the ocean with your car" huh
[4:20:53] <derap41> 4
[4:20:54] <mariothemaio> game like "oh you want content? here you go, shoot this child or fuck off"
[4:20:57] <+eanscrale> Nah man, that dirt is a road, and it's a dead end
[4:20:58] <the_angelon_experience> Keeping Kim's trust is worth it
[4:21:03] <LlewynMarie> this game doesn't give damn
[4:21:07] <user_naim> you know, regular child shooting hijinks
[4:21:08] <Louie_Salmon> @aiutare47 Certain ones definitely, lots of them are fine to fail
[4:21:11] <%Arnoldoaad1> 1
[4:21:13] <derap41> Pat killed the kid
[4:21:15] <Chogex> @gitgouda "but judge, she was asking to be murdered"
[4:21:18] <merrja> this game is wild. for example. did you know that the most wholesome ideology quest is fascism?
[4:21:25] <aiutare47> @Louie_Salmon I mean THIS check, if you fail this its bad right
[4:21:29] <+Firgof> EvenBiggerFear Installed
[4:21:29] <DSD24> Nope
[4:21:30] <%hax_metatron> NOT YET
[4:21:33] <%gitgouda> @chogex its gonna go great definatly.
[4:21:34] <+athuramn> there are objectively bad decisions you can make
[4:21:36] <%X2Eliah> So remember how in 2008 gamers were upset that you couldn't kill the kids at little lamplight in Fallout 3?
[4:21:40] <primaryfire> esprit de corps does
[4:21:40] <+TheotherKristian> Empathy
[4:21:41] <elshadow7> Kim shows you what he thinks of you
[4:21:41] <mariothemaio> actually good/bad cop is the kim rating more or less
[4:21:42] <+Kataguro> The Kim stat is very important
[4:21:42] <%X2Eliah> This game solves it.
[4:21:42] <Eger007> esprit de corps
[4:21:44] <candidateplays> ....the fascist quest is NOT wholesome
[4:21:44] <+HeroSolaire> Comunnist 10
[4:21:45] <DSD24> Hehe
[4:21:45] <sushahana> good cop/ bad cop
[4:21:48] <Monkeyweed21> espirit de corps
[4:21:48] <Lancaster_H> beyond the pale you say
[4:21:49] <linSP> Kim stat is hidden
[4:21:49] <Dio_TR> Kim really trusts you
[4:21:50] <reonome> espirit de corps kinda does
[4:21:51] <ingman112> There's a slight hint to that in Good Cop/Bad Cop
[4:21:51] <laserbeaming> hehe, accidental pun
[4:21:51] <Ids560> it's good cop/bad cop. Esprit and empathy can tell you in the moment as well
[4:21:52] <Eger007> espri de corps does that
[4:21:52] <Dio_TR> :)
[4:21:52] <laguerrilha> Espirit de Cops
[4:21:53] <derap41> Kim will let you know
[4:21:53] <jorniev> RIGHT THERE IT DOES
[4:21:54] <walaladun> esprit de corps show it
[4:21:56] <ReganSenpai> you have to learn to read kim on your own
[4:21:57] <+SealOfKoalaTea> It is a hidden stat, but you will know
[4:21:57] <cumurasame> @DSD24 I think I know why you just laughed, I love it
[4:21:58] <jorniev> YOU MISSED IT
[4:21:58] <LlewynMarie> that's what Esprite and empathy are for
[4:21:58] <merrja> Kim is Officer/Detective
[4:21:58] <+Pequod1> they musta fought ww2 with mustkets
[4:22:02] <Indigo_Automaton> Pale? Kappa
[4:22:04] <walaladun> esprit de corps and empathy
[4:22:04] <reonome> man kim is so cool even when he misses
[4:22:06] <+MightyDuckShoes> Esprit de Corps
[4:22:07] <+HeroSolaire> @candidateplays u re wrong, cum abstence is actually wholesome
[4:22:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> somebody say Pale?
[4:22:09] <jorniev> THERE IS A STAT
[4:22:11] <primaryfire> esprit de corps is pretty much the empathy stat but for kim
[4:22:12] <+athuramn> @lancaster_h did he say that knowingly lol?
[4:22:14] <laguerrilha> You should put a couple of point in Spirit de Cops
[4:22:15] <%Sarevic> ACTUALLY-
[4:22:17] <gunsrlove> Why not Easy does it, no moral support for good ole Kim :( :(
[4:22:20] <skunk1324> pale mention again monkaS
[4:22:21] <derap41> Imagine the debrief you would have had after you tried to kill the kid
[4:22:23] <ingman112> You really gonna go for it?
[4:22:28] <aiutare47> are you
[4:22:32] <+Firgof> Nah, they had full automatics and all that. Cops, however, only get to fire muzzle-loaded single shots
[4:22:32] <+Huderga> TRY AGAIN
[4:22:32] <reonome> DO IT
[4:22:33] <iacus_> would be awesome if you pulled it off tho

[4:27:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> He's more upset that the body is still in the tree
[4:27:43] <X2Eliah> Thing is, asking harbour help is the bad way
[4:27:46] <%thetunnelhomer> Cuno is a saint actually, if you learn about him.
[4:27:46] <derap41> @Indigo_Automaton Can't kill what's already dead

[4:29:36] <ingman112> Yeah wait on that
[4:29:41] <ReganSenpai> don't save scum frivilous things. do save scum stuff that will affect the main case.
[4:29:41] <Crippl3> yeah that's a long one
[4:29:41] <+SealOfKoalaTea> You could save scum... to shoot again on drugs OR try a new method
[4:29:51] <+SealOfKoalaTea> You need that one
[4:29:52] <%nintega010> are we going back to talk to the super racist

[4:30:13] <andre11dr> That seems really good
[4:30:14] <dmtjinni> I wish woolz was bit more commie tho
[4:30:15] <+Kataguro> Oh yeah, your ledger should be able to be tried again. The Dead Man gave you a hint
[4:30:15] <jorniev> can he talk to evrat?
[4:30:16] <%X2Eliah> We learned things
[4:30:17] <+justianxix> the daily grind
[4:30:18] <dukenux> Ledger?
[4:30:18] <derap41> you can fail every roll in this game and still finish it
[4:30:18] <the_angelon_experience> Not like you almsot shot a kid or something
[4:30:21] <AlbertoRobert> you could talk to joyce too
[4:30:35] <Dio_TR> LUL
[4:30:39] <Nullseven> Almost ended the day with a rousing round of child murder
[4:30:48] <@Menitta> "Another day another dollar"
[4:30:51] <%X2Eliah> Joyce will be asleep by now
[4:30:54] <%TheTyper> A whopping $13 lol
[4:30:56] <+Firgof> It's true, but that convo is probably some 20-30 minutes of Grade A content locked-convo-dialog
[4:30:59] <DatAsuna> And not that mixed shit either
[4:31:01] <AlbertoRobert> @X2Eliah she never sleeps
[4:31:02] <%HeroToxiko> "fancy poutine" sounds like a trip
[4:31:02] <+walternatorz> this poor girl is working 16 hour days
[4:31:04] <%krispen_wa> why isnt woolie keeping his morale at max?
[4:31:07] <derap41> hmm
[4:31:08] <jorniev> 1.60
[4:31:14] <derap41> you got fuck all
[4:31:18] <JayEarly> @derap41 what about that one shivers roll
[4:31:20] <o2u4> Thank you Inland Emprie
[4:31:23] <T_Sasquatch> @krispen_wa he has to learn the hard way
[4:31:24] <ingman112> @krispen_wa B/c it's almost bedtime
[4:31:38] <derap41> @JayEarly You can fail all of them and still finish the game
[4:31:44] <%TheTyper> Well that's cool, didn't realize Inland Empire's dialogue will differ on your copotype too
[4:31:45] <%TheTyper> Jeez
[4:31:58] <Monkeyweed21> @WoolieVersus you can retry the ledget btw
[4:32:05] <Ids560> you have 1 bullet

[4:32:12] <%X2Eliah> shh
[4:32:16] <+HeroSolaire> Throw the ledge away
[4:32:17] <bonebagMEL> I just got here, did these 2 actually tried to kill the girl??
[4:32:18] <derap41> Wish you would have stuck to it instead of scumming it
[4:32:26] <JayEarly> @thetyper inland empire feels like the main character of the skills
[4:32:31] <jorniev> can he talk to evret right now?
[4:32:33] <DatAsuna> this has been a good session
[4:32:34] <the_angelon_experience> @bonebagMEL yep
[4:32:36] <derap41> if you shoot her you get lynched
[4:32:36] <bonebagMEL> @JayEarly It tends to be
[4:32:37] <Monkeyweed21> @bonebagMEL CONTENT
[4:32:38] <%hax_metatron> Shivers is the main skill IMO
[4:32:39] <ingman112> @jorniev Nope
[4:32:39] <ulcaban> Racism and child murder
[4:32:43] <iacus_> not scumming would have made the rest of the game less entertaining tho
[4:32:47] <%X2Eliah> How many other games let you experience this
[4:32:51] <%TheTyper> @JayEarly Either that or volition. I'm doing a run right now with Inland as my primary
[4:32:52] <ReganSenpai> i wonder how the tenants felt about hearing gunshots
[4:32:54] <Pappajimbo> our writers made it up
[4:32:59] <bonebagMEL> I can't say I didn't at least AIM at her... but I didn't pull the trigger
[4:33:02] <+Jeshk0> Jamais Vu! Jamais Vu! I never saw it
[4:33:03] <sporeian94> Lemme tell you something, it's only gonna get worse
[4:33:03] <T_Sasquatch> it never happened, complete fiction
[4:33:04] <ulcaban> You had to be there!

[4:33:11] <laguerrilha> Go to sleep before ending it
[4:33:15] <bonebagMEL> @krispen_wa They got it
[4:33:16] <derap41> Its a fabrication
[4:33:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> worth it

[4:34:35] <%TheTyper> @andre11dr There's a reason actually
[4:34:37] <+SealOfKoalaTea> What a fucking game
[4:34:43] <%Arnoldoaad1> Now you are having the full cop experience. NOT SORRY!!
[4:34:48] <sushahana> @Monkeyweed21 yeye
[4:34:49] <linSP> if you‚Äôre wondering, if you succeed at killing the kid the game ends with you going to prison
[4:34:50] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Fun seeing you guys react to it
[4:34:56] <ReganSenpai> that's fine emotionally taxing
[4:34:58] <andre11dr> @thetyper Right that stuff
[4:34:59] <Monkeyweed21> CUNOESSE LOOKED LIKE SHE HAD A GUN
[4:35:06] <+SealOfKoalaTea> That was some heavy shit
[4:35:08] <DSD24> The Beast he says
[4:35:08] <mariothemaio> this was a fun session :)
[4:35:18] <balthazar758> fuck
[4:35:18] <@Solidus_113> you get a unique game over from succeeding at that
[4:35:25] <ReganSenpai> talk time
[4:35:30] <%TheTyper> Ohhhhh. Jeez sounds like these two managed to find even WORSE bad rolls than last week.
[4:35:32] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Remember to ask Pat about this part, I'm sure he'll have something to say! LUL
[4:35:33] <derap41> Woolie this happens daily
[4:35:33] <andre11dr> Content was had
[4:35:34] <%KetsuoTaberu> Cheer500 I want to get off Mr. Buffet's Wild Ride
[4:35:39] <%HeroToxiko> yup
[4:35:43] <available_line> This will be longer than the KOTOR2 playthrough and I love it.
[4:35:44] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Let's be honest. How often does shooting at kids as a cop actually get anyone fired?
[4:35:45] <+SealOfKoalaTea> yuuuuuuup
[4:35:48] <mariothemaio> the game won't forget that
[4:35:52] <Blank9> can't live with your failures
[4:35:57] <+SealOfKoalaTea> Kim will remember that.
[4:35:59] <%illtima> DO IT PIG
[4:36:00] <+Firgof> Folks being all 'We do the whole buffet' until they realize Disco Elysium has a Cannibalism Section
[4:36:02] <%illtima> SET ME FREE
[4:36:06] <derap41> btw Pat shot her
[4:36:06] <T_Sasquatch> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx every where isnt america :)
[4:36:08] <Lancaster_H> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx depends, are you in the US or not?
[4:36:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> glimpses are goo
[4:36:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> good*
[4:36:30] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Monkeyweed21
[4:36:32] <DatAsuna> You can't, it's a game over
[4:36:32] <+athuramn> @xmasterkeef420bluntninjax if yes to the us, I
[4:36:34] <%Stonesoul_> D4C too good not to use
[4:36:36] <mariothemaio> @Firgof lol basically, you shouldn't buffet the game because it remembers so many of your decisions
[4:36:38] <ReganSenpai> undoing was the right choice. i just feel bad ya couldn't get the body down
[4:36:40] <@Solidus_113> you get a unique game over from succeeding at that
[4:36:45] <jorniev> Thats something i agree with
[4:36:47] <AngryAsian5> Do what you're comfortable with
[4:36:57] <+SealOfKoalaTea> yep yep
[4:36:59] <Monkeyweed21> Cunoesse looked like she had a gun it was self defense
[4:36:59] <derap41> Kim Doesn't forget that
[4:37:08] <merrja> oh yeah the game hit you repeately for that
[4:37:09] <Blank9> you can be an apocalypse fascist co
[4:37:13] <DSD24> Shot AT Reggie
[4:37:15] <Monkeyweed21> Kim WILL remember that
[4:37:17] <linSP> Kim doesn‚Äôt forget that you tried to shoot the kid if you fail
[4:37:20] <available_line> AFAIR, if you shoot the kid the game actually game overs.
[4:37:20] <+OblivionSword1> Kim will remember that
[4:37:22] <+AWKWARDL0SER> You don‚Äôt want to punch children you don‚Äôt want to shoot them what‚Äôs wrong with you man? You‚Äôre a cop dammit
[4:37:22] <%TheTyper> @ReganSenpai I gotta say I am looking forward to this particular communist-heavy run though. Alllllll about failure.
[4:37:27] <+Firgof> The worse outcome is actually missing her after trying to shoot her, very very true
[4:37:27] <%Lion_kun> But she deserved it
[4:37:28] <%HeroToxiko> you represent the pd LUL
[4:37:29] <JayEarly> @xmasterkeef420bluntninjax there‚Äôs worse things than bring fired, like Kim not being your friend
[4:37:29] <derap41> But she was threatening
[4:37:30] <Ids560> Kim's a cop at the end of the day
[4:37:31] <+SealOfKoalaTea> "what the fuck kinda psyco am i with?" Kim
[4:37:33] <DSD24> Shot a kid with HIS GUN
[4:37:34] <iacus_> you were teaching them a lesson
[4:37:35] <+walternatorz> Authority check.
[4:37:44] <%TheTyper> Even if they deny being communists, they're succeeding at 0.00000% of this game ;)
[4:37:55] <derap41> So insane it happens in real life
[4:37:58] <mariothemaio> shoot a kid and have fun adventures afterward, it's fine LUL LUL LUL
[4:37:59] <+Firgof> Fun Topics for Podcasts!
[4:38:00] <andre11dr> Well if you become a Facist ,Kim will just fucking leave, which is insane because his so much of the game
[4:38:06] <dukenux> Cunoesse clearly made you fear for your life with her aggresive T posing
[4:38:08] <iacus_> wow really
[4:38:17] <bonebagMEL> This game is great
[4:38:18] <Monkeyweed21> @WoolieVersus the true cop experience: having coworkers that are total scum
[4:38:24] <+walternatorz> shivers always gives shivers
[4:38:24] <DestroyerPhoenix> @andre11dr lol seriously? Makes sense tbh
[4:38:25] <ReganSenpai> talking to the body was cool
[4:38:26] <%krispen_wa> Where the hood
[4:38:34] <Lancaster_H> what if Shivers told you to pull the trigger
[4:38:35] <JayEarly> @andre11dr holy shit

[4:39:08] <user_naim> Game calls your bluff
[4:39:09] <Blank9> you need legendary composure to shoot a child
