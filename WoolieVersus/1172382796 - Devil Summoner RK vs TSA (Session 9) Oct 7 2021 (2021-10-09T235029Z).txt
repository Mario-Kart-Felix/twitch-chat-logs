[0:00:10] <leith_aziz> Hello
[0:00:18] <leith_aziz> nicobWave
[0:00:29] <UnsteadyFunk> I haven't caught you live in so long I'm glad I got in on this today
[0:00:31] <leith_aziz> Nah, we can keep the jam
[0:00:42] <%dylheim93> straight in with the jams
[0:01:01] <+DatAsuna> storm alert?
[0:01:12] <dds333a> the kidnapping alert
[0:01:16] <+DatAsuna> oof
[0:01:18] <leith_aziz> nicobThink ?
[0:01:20] <dds333a> *potential
[0:01:21] <Majestic_Flof> F
[0:01:39] <+DatAsuna> shoulda gone with the "baby's cry" protocol
[0:01:43] <dds333a> LUL
[0:01:58] <@Menitta> Oh jeez
[0:02:27] <%Seancicle> Now act like you weren't just sleeping
[0:02:27] <UnsteadyFunk> "Oh shit an Amber Alert at 3am I better keep my eye out for this kid in the dark."
[0:02:43] <dds333a> WoolievsGod final round
[0:02:48] <@Menitta> any time my phone screams like that, I feel apocalyptic lmao
[0:03:05] <+„Éï„Ç©„Éº„É≥„ÇØ„É´„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éü„Ç≠„Éí„É≠> holy shit. we don't have that, but the earthquake alert we get in Tokyo is pretty frightening too. just had one a couple hours ago ü•∂ü•∂
[0:03:33] <dds333a> right
[0:03:49] <leith_aziz> @„Éï„Ç©„Éº„É≥„ÇØ„É´„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éü„Ç≠„Éí„É≠ Sorry to hear that. Hopefully, no one got hurt nicobLove
[0:04:15] <+„Éï„Ç©„Éº„É≥„ÇØ„É´„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éü„Ç≠„Éí„É≠> so far so good. hopefully no aftershocks. ty!
[0:04:50] <ulcaban> Left on Red (state)?
[0:04:53] <Darkdrill> Hello woolie and reggie
[0:04:54] <dds333a> it's in the past Kappa
[0:05:04] <%ZweihanderSteve> wash that slat and away AND KEEP IT AWAY
[0:05:08] <+PapayaBumpkin> Gotta snap back to reality
[0:05:08] <linSP> All smiles :)
[0:05:12] <+DatAsuna> could be this stream or next
[0:05:18] <Darkdrill> Woolie woke up For the motherland (Russia)
[0:05:26] <UnsteadyFunk> I've been trying to catch up on this on Youtube but I'm so far behind on what's going on plot wise
[0:05:29] <+DatAsuna> but with woolie time probably safer to bet next+
[0:05:34] <dds333a> @datasuna might wanna tack on a potential third just in case LUL
[0:05:34] <leith_aziz> I don't know how to lead in a convo liek this naturally. I listented to an opinion I didn't want to hear at night, and it somehow managed to frustrate me to the point that I had problem sleeping. I hate the fact that I let it get to that point  nicobOof
[0:05:40] <%ZweihanderSteve> sounds about right.  raidou has a short list of demons.
[0:05:46] <andre11dr> This reminds me when made an ambient playlist to fall asleep but i messed up and accidentally added some very non chill songs LUL
[0:05:50] <dds333a> no
[0:05:56] <leith_aziz> Oh boy nicobThink
[0:05:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:05:57] <dds333a> or?
[0:06:23] <Zayasu> anyone got a link?
[0:06:36] <leith_aziz> I guess its fine? nicobShrug
[0:06:38] <dds333a> @unsteadyfunk the Soulless God has risen, and now Raidou has to put a stop to it.
[0:06:39] <linSP> if they link back it‚Äôs fine I guess?
[0:06:59] <Darkdrill> tik tok doesnt do monitize
[0:07:11] <@Solidus_113> it took the place of Vines
[0:07:12] <+DatAsuna> Instagram has the same monitoring lol
[0:07:15] <Darkdrill> they run ads
[0:07:16] <dds333a> @zweihandersteve it does, unfortunately you can't always judge the length of an SMT game by the number of demons they have LUL
[0:07:49] <andre11dr> Yeah people just kinda forgot that it's China surveillance
[0:07:55] <UnsteadyFunk> @dds333a Oh, alright then. Yeah I'm way behind. Last part I watched the boys put a cat into a blender.
[0:08:00] <Darkdrill> Woolie can kite on tiktok :D
[0:08:07] <@Menitta> Tik Tok is another dimension
[0:08:09] <%Seancicle> „ÅØ„Çì‚ÜóÔ∏è„ÅØ„Çì‚ÜòÔ∏è„ÅØ„Çì‚ÜôÔ∏è„ÅØ„Çì‚ÜóÔ∏è
[0:08:18] <%Seancicle> üòÖüëåüèª
[0:08:33] <+DatAsuna> If you're worried about monitoring, any social media is bad news basically.
[0:08:41] <leith_aziz> I know nothing about Tik Tok. Other than that, I've never used Twitter either. I feel like Twitter would destory me mentally. nicobLurk
[0:08:49] <Darkdrill> tik tok makes me feel old LUL
[0:08:56] <leith_aziz> *destroy
[0:09:13] <@Menitta> tik tok is something I can just let the funny ones hit Twitter or whatever
[0:09:15] <+DatAsuna> Everyone is selling your data, security aside
[0:09:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @leith_aziz as much as i like it for following woolie, pat and other content creators, the rest is just so shit
[0:09:32] <@Menitta> I really dont need to curate that myself lol
[0:09:40] <andre11dr> But dosen't Facebook do the same shit? They just send it to the US instead of China
[0:09:46] <%ZweihanderSteve> you know what they say, the safest computer is one that's unhooked and 100ft underground
[0:09:51] <+DatAsuna> Yeah sifting through it for the good stuff seems tiresome
[0:10:14] <Darkdrill> most apps that get created are not designed with security in mind
[0:10:16] <+Jiggisnipe> the users don't care
[0:10:20] <leith_aziz> You dont have a need for Tik Tok. Just avoid it
[0:10:29] <dds333a> as they do
[0:10:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> If you just keep ignoring the problem, it means it's not there
[0:10:51] <+DatAsuna> Even a month is too long
[0:10:54] <UnsteadyFunk> Tik Tok is like Chat Roulette, you have to search through a whole lot of horrible garbage to get to any single nugget of anything decent and it just isn't worth it.
[0:11:02] <dds333a> none Kappa
[0:11:06] <Darkdrill> woolie surf the waves of hot news
[0:11:49] <@Solidus_113> is it catching wind today
[0:11:50] <+Jiggisnipe> I hear your PM missed that day Kappa
[0:11:51] <Darkdrill> all stuff that goes up goes down effectually
[0:11:52] <%Seancicle> call Justice Wagner
[0:12:05] <professorbadvibes> hi woolie and reggie
[0:12:09] <+trackles_64> is it pancake day yet?
[0:12:39] <+Jiggisnipe> you must learn the truth and reconcile
[0:12:41] <leith_aziz> I dont think I could handle Twitter. Imagine being a GG lorehead and a JoJo fan and expecting to find a civil, non insulting discussion that's not just memes.
[0:13:11] <+Jiggisnipe> CSB content on Tiktok
[0:13:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:13:17] <Darkdrill> tik tok?
[0:13:19] <+DatAsuna> @leith_aziz twitter character limit basically ensures shitposting is the norm over real discussion tbh
[0:13:30] <andre11dr> You'd think with Justin in office so long, they would just turn the maple leaf into a blackface by now
[0:13:51] <leith_aziz> Woolie's mind: nicobThink ... nicobShrug ... nicobOof
[0:13:52] <Darkdrill> i wish fine did not die :C
[0:14:16] <@Menitta> YouTube shorts
[0:14:16] <dds333a> until the next one comes
[0:14:28] <%Prevot> and YouTube has tiktok style videos now
[0:14:29] <DANsehbaricl> "In my dreams, I see a man, dressed in jaguar skins and feathered like a blooded saint. What came from the heart lubricated us, it crushed evil under its tread and liberated us all." Cheer500
[0:14:31] <+PapayaBumpkin> Vine‚Ä¶ socpensBeeboo
[0:14:40] <Darkdrill> NotLikeThis a tik tok hell all communication must be done while dancing
[0:14:56] <dds333a> neither did i LUL
[0:15:16] <dds333a> I remember only my professors had it at first
[0:15:20] <@Menitta> I dont like Tik Tok because it has a much higher than average rate of seeing a 13 year old's opinion
[0:15:21] <Darkdrill> LUL LUL  thats rough
[0:15:22] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:15:26] <Puhff> but Woolie, how will I know if I'm cool if I don't give in to peer pressure???
[0:15:38] <+DatAsuna> Kind of a dick move, but then again if you're the one friend without it, yeah
[0:15:41] <@Solidus_113> they're not wrong though, it's got a good event setup page
[0:16:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's fucking stupid and petty
[0:16:10] <%Seancicle> ü•¥
[0:16:15] <linSP> I told my coworker I don‚Äôt have a Facebook and they asked me how it feels being off the grid, feels good man
[0:16:15] <Darkdrill> LUL  old facebook was good
[0:16:25] <%sriracha_pon> My family does that
[0:16:36] <+DatAsuna> Insta's the worst of the bunch imho
[0:16:43] <@Menitta> Snapchat is worse imo
[0:16:48] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:17:01] <@Solidus_113> I don't take photos of myself to need any of the extra shit
[0:17:10] <@Menitta> installing Snaochat was the first moment I went "I DO NOT GET IT" and felt old
[0:17:12] <linSP> I want to go back to AIM!
[0:17:14] <+DatAsuna> snapchat still exists?
[0:17:16] <@Menitta> I was 19.
[0:17:16] <leith_aziz> @Menitta That's already a pretty wide spectrum, then you have someone here who can't deal with opinions that insult you or what you like. You're fu*ked nicobPalm
[0:17:20] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[0:17:21] <+Jiggisnipe> that's a video
[0:17:40] <dds333a> I hate em
[0:17:52] <@Solidus_113> power levels are dumb
[0:18:00] <+DatAsuna> Honkai has my favourite version of villain plot armour: For the boss fight, you play the villain and beat up the hero.
[0:18:00] <leith_aziz> As in he cant kill him or doesnt want to? The latter works
[0:18:21] <@Menitta> the term plot armor is weird to me because that's how writing works, no?

[0:18:31] <Puhff> oh yeah totallyu
[0:18:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> usually not a big fan, im on the fence about zenos, but for sure hated ranjit or whatever his name was
[0:18:32] <+Jiggisnipe> was that plot armor or did he just run away?
[0:18:45] <leith_aziz> Gonna mute since I've never played FF6: nicobEZ
[0:18:57] <+DatAsuna> @leith_aziz ff6 talk is already over
[0:18:59] <linSP> kefka has that shroud in that one cutscene that blocked all magic
[0:19:00] <Darkdrill> dio :D
[0:19:11] <dds333a> @menitta the term applies usually to where the plot has morphed around them in order to protect then
[0:19:14] <+PapayaBumpkin> Man that dude doesn‚Äôt have plot armor he‚Äôs got like‚Ä¶..a step above plot armor
[0:19:21] <leith_aziz> Yeah, I can get behind that idea
[0:19:26] <+yusefHD> Bust out your best jojo pose tho
[0:19:27] <dds333a> Like Hayato
[0:19:28] <+DatAsuna> part 4 is less plot armour and more just having bullshit buffs
[0:19:31] <+yusefHD> LUL
[0:19:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> does kai leng count as having plot armor?
[0:19:40] <+DatAsuna> @cobalt_phoenix_ 100%
[0:19:43] <JetpackMcQuack> kira gave me anxiety
[0:19:48] <@Menitta> oh yeah ok kai leng
[0:19:48] <andre11dr> "most"
[0:19:53] <%Seancicle> ambivalence is a hell of a high
[0:19:54] <+dmbender> The problem with villain plot armor is that they sometimes get to that cliche "ENOUGH" moment when they just nuke you and run off. I'm doing my fist DMC 5 playthrough and I really like how Urizen has been when playing as Nero (I just got do Dante's first mission)
[0:20:01] <dds333a> Jojo doesn't abuse plot armor as much as people think, even Dio Brando surviving the mansion fire is explained in the manga
[0:20:03] <@Menitta> yeah I take it back. plot armor sucks
[0:20:03] <someyounguy1> plot armor is ok to me when the mc can somehow get on that level as well
[0:20:12] <leith_aziz> Kira is the best antagonist yet since Im only on post Part 5
[0:20:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[0:20:24] <+yusefHD> Kirby Kira Seth basically
[0:20:27] <andre11dr> And then there's part 5 where you just gain a new power out of your ass
[0:20:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there's a difference between plot armor and a good strat, plot armor sucks
[0:20:34] <Darkdrill> cheating is the best :D when both sides do it
[0:20:38] <dds333a> Invisible air bombs, genius application LUL
[0:20:46] <dds333a> unkillable
[0:20:53] <dds333a> unless Kappa
[0:20:56] <+DatAsuna> SMT If: the villain gains plot armour and goes from incel doing rituals in his high school gym to god emperor of hell
[0:20:59] <leith_aziz> Without knowing anything, im gonna guess youre talking about a certain D
[0:21:06] <+yusefHD> unKIRAble oh my god
[0:21:08] <%Lion_kun> LOVE TRAIN
[0:21:09] <+PapayaBumpkin> Yeah Kira was a dirty cheater can‚Äôt even believe they pulled out a win

[0:21:35] <%baka_sugoi> THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP
[0:21:37] <andre11dr> We on a Love Train, love train
[0:21:38] <+DatAsuna> swtor has a few good cheating bullshit wins.
[0:21:42] <Darkdrill> LUL
[0:21:47] <%baka_sugoi> AND THIS GUN
[0:21:50] <linSP> Cheat with volcanos
[0:21:50] <undeadcoffeebean> and then, the hero wins the end
[0:21:52] <+yusefHD> Dragon Ball Super is some BS sometimes too. The entire Tournament of Power was 40m long, but man went UI
[0:21:57] <ulcaban> "Random bullshit go!' 'Wait, it worked!?'
[0:22:03] <leith_aziz> The power of bullshit is infinite nicobProud
[0:22:03] <+DatAsuna> Willpower gets a bit too shonen BS for me
[0:22:07] <dds333a> Gurren Lagann levels LUL
[0:22:07] <@Solidus_113> Gurren
[0:22:14] <@Menitta> you know who doesn't have plot armor
[0:22:15] <+trackles_64> Kill la kill lol
[0:22:19] <@Menitta> Little Mac
[0:22:21] <+yusefHD> doryu bureakaa
[0:22:27] <dds333a> @menitta truth
[0:22:31] <+DatAsuna> I'm very over the shonen boy who screams so loud the rules stop applying
[0:22:38] <someyounguy1> the waaaagh field
[0:22:39] <andre11dr> And then there's Joseph who literally just wins by luck
[0:22:40] <@Solidus_113> it's red so it shoots faster
[0:22:44] <%LastHazzerd> correct.
[0:22:47] <+yusefHD> @DatAsuna LUL
[0:22:52] <dds333a> That was a rule that eventually became a thing, that wasn't actually true at the start LUL
[0:22:52] <linSP> it‚Äôs a GUN
[0:22:52] <+dmbender> Red ones go fasta
[0:22:54] <undeadcoffeebean> like The Secret?
[0:23:01] <Fnir> latent telepaths right ?
[0:23:02] <someyounguy1> the more of them that believe it the stronger the effect, example there is a man in the human empire who cant die cause orcs think hes unkillable
[0:23:08] <%Seancicle> Tony built this in a cave with scraps üëäüèª
[0:23:09] <+trackles_64> @DatAsuna  and also never gets a girl for no reason
[0:23:09] <+vaderxyz1970> A ork Battlewagon had a picture of an engine in it and it worked
[0:23:12] <someyounguy1> red ones go fasta
[0:23:15] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Joseph's wins tends to feel the most "YES!". I guess cause its Joseph
[0:23:15] <+DatAsuna> 40K orcs are like the stock market
[0:23:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Purple ones are smarter
[0:23:19] <%LastHazzerd> they are latent psychers
[0:23:22] <+DatAsuna> Stonks go up
[0:23:24] <%ZweihanderSteve> they wear literal buckets on their head thinking it'll let them breathe in space
[0:23:27] <+yusefHD> Someone tell reggie the hair is looking fresh as fuck - sheeesh
[0:23:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's if painting flames on the side of your car actually made it faster
[0:23:30] <%baka_sugoi> Believe in GUN
[0:23:38] <leith_aziz> I mean Green Lantern is straight up willpower
[0:23:39] <%LastHazzerd> "dis nail in me 'ead makes me sma'er"
[0:23:45] <+vaderxyz1970> its shitty megiver
[0:23:45] <funnyfunnykid> Every Orc has watched Naruto
[0:23:51] <%Javaa01> Yeah, in 40k willpower can literally manifest physically due to the rules of the world
[0:24:17] <@Menitta> "this gun is good because red" "that's a banana painted red"
[0:24:24] <Darkdrill> that sounds heavy
[0:24:24] <+Jiggisnipe> poignant
[0:24:30] <%ZweihanderSteve> SeemsGood
[0:24:31] <andre11dr> Green Lantern is the most OP power ever, but it's in the hands of a dumbfuck
[0:24:31] <undeadcoffeebean> #deep
[0:24:36] <leith_aziz> That sounbds heavy-daze
[0:24:49] <%Prevot> what
[0:24:53] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Depends on which one you're talking about
[0:25:09] <%LastHazzerd> an omen?
[0:25:16] <@Menitta> That sounds bad on it's own LUL
[0:25:17] <+vaderxyz1970> Sounds like Hotline Miama 2
[0:25:25] <+PapayaBumpkin> That‚Äôs an original omen
[0:25:27] <+Jiggisnipe> it was from their mind

[2:10:30] <+aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Hey Woolie, glad to see you and Reggie back. Also, in case it ever comes back: BOARD GAME RECOMMENDATION TIME. You like your minis? You like Alien?! Check out Nemesis, a semi-coop game that's legally distinct from Alien.

[2:17:52] <DSD24> Metal Gear Sal
[2:17:52] <drunken_lemur> Eh
[2:17:57] <penitentpendant> Sort of, they run into the 'mass produced' problem
[2:17:57] <DSD24> Metal Gear Rex
[2:18:00] <cyberneticflower> a weapon that can surpass metal gear!
[2:18:04] <%ChoculaUltra> Sal was insanely ahead of its time for whatever reason LUL
[2:18:06] <+NopeBadguy> There's like a really big valley between Sahelanthropus and other Metal Gear
[2:18:06] <Joestar1890> Every Metal Gear is a step down from Sal
[2:18:06] <kingra> Metal gear ray LUL
[2:18:06] <Renzaku69> It started with Shagohod didnt it?
[2:18:11] <%Prevot> fucking ray

[2:18:42] <%baka_sugoi> then theres Sahlanthropus Kappa
[2:18:45] <cyberneticflower> I have some fondness for the rex railgun
[2:18:48] <penitentpendant> Super Prototype vs Mass Produced
[2:18:52] <+NopeBadguy> It should be pointed out that Rays were mass produced for pmc use as of MGR
[2:18:53] <@Solidus_113> unless you put a nuke on it
[2:18:54] <Renzaku69> Woolie "Ill Smash that Robot" Madden
[2:19:03] <%LastHazzerd> what was the name of Rising's gear?
[2:19:10] <+LandOfTheWay> Sal was crazy powerful, but it couldn't be piloted unless you happen to have a psychic child around, and there's only so many of those
[2:19:12] <@Solidus_113> Excelsius
[2:19:14] <cyberneticflower> I forget what max loyalty does in this game

[2:19:28] <penitentpendant> "Time to Mourn" = "Time to Clone"

[2:20:57] <+NopeBadguy> THERE HE IS
[2:20:59] <+NopeBadguy> LMAO
[2:21:00] <dds333a> no, he resummoned him
[2:21:05] <+NopeBadguy> oh
[2:21:10] <penitentpendant> The power of DEMON CLONING
[2:21:29] <DSD24> Don't think about things?
[2:21:30] <+NopeBadguy> THAT CONCEPT HORRIFIES ME
[2:21:31] <drunken_lemur> Except that one time with Riker
[2:21:34] <cyberneticflower> you're thinking of the prestige lol
[2:21:57] <dds333a> @cyberneticflower exactly, it's Angier LUL
[2:22:00] <penitentpendant> "Congrats! You just signed your rights away to mass produce you, now that you've teleported using our service ONCE."
[2:22:11] <dds333a> Satake is so cool, damn
[2:22:25] <cyberneticflower> this game combines my love of smt with my love of period pieces
[2:22:29] <+pupil31> Drip
[2:22:45] <DSD24> Wearing a coat on the shoulders is the coolest look
[2:23:26] <DSD24> Oh man this is some SMT4 Neutral ending stuff
[2:23:47] <cyberneticflower> @DSD24 minus having to consult a guide to get on the path!
[2:23:56] <alroy900> ah, of course, a yakusa can activate the mystical wood stick
[2:24:00] <DSD24> @cyberneticflower Oh yeah this is a lot more clear
[2:24:02] <%DashXero> Why is the cat talking from beyond the grave?
[2:24:02] <lonosis47> How is woolie still playing this it feels like its been months since he started
[2:24:11] <+ninja_galt> oi oi oi
[2:24:18] <DSD24> @lonosis47 Well he did get married in between playing this
[2:24:24] <dds333a> If you talk to all the npc's  a lot of them are glad to be alive. pensive about the future, and just generally relieved, so yeah LUL
[2:24:27] <+ninja_galt> SMT games take hundreds of hours
[2:24:51] <dds333a> Lot of little npc plotlines get  done here
[2:24:53] <+NopeBadguy> i think 40 is more of a softcap?
[2:24:55] <+NopeBadguy> lemme doublecheck
[2:25:01] <dds333a> no, hard
[2:25:14] <+ninja_galt> I probably spend 40 hours just in the blue room combining monsters
[2:25:31] <cyberneticflower> back in the dark ages before you could chose inherited skills!
[2:25:58] <+NopeBadguy> no, 40 is hard cap
[2:25:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1445269798884155394?s=19
[2:26:03] <dds333a> @cyberneticflower especially since fusion in this game is already different from other games in the franchise LUL
[2:26:06] <Renzaku69> lol coping with jokes XD
[2:26:06] <DSD24> Man the term "healslut" is always rough
[2:26:09] <+NopeBadguy> i think you can go past 40 in nocturne
[2:26:14] <+NopeBadguy> that's probably what i was thinking of
[2:26:27] <+ninja_galt> SMT:Nocturne is the one I played yea
[2:26:36] <cyberneticflower> yeah "Healslut" is...not a term I'd use
[2:26:40] <cyberneticflower> nocturne was rad
[2:26:51] <+ninja_galt> It had Dante in it.
[2:26:58] <DSD24> Nocturne is the epitome of "I want to punch God in the face"
[2:27:01] <dds333a> going on fusion benders is always so fun in each of these games
[2:27:16] <%baka_sugoi> my job here is done
[2:27:24] <+ninja_galt> I probably spent 40 hours monster fusing in Persona 4 too
[2:27:25] <dds333a> @dsd24 try four beforehand LUL
[2:27:34] <dds333a> * four games
[2:27:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @NopeBadguy
[2:27:50] <cyberneticflower> not a smt game unless you can punch god or equivalent in the face
[2:27:50] <+NopeBadguy> who even has the power to try when it's all demons
[2:28:02] <%LastHazzerd> i need more QUANTUM power
[2:28:07] <dds333a> They're all coming together, but nobody knows about where the other one went LUL
[2:28:10] <+ninja_galt> It's not all demons. A bunch of them are hindu gods too
[2:28:27] <dds333a> Which are demons, in MT parlance LUL
[2:28:53] <+ninja_galt> a bunch of the japanese ones like oni are demons
[2:29:04] <OblivionSword1> Gods are basically just divine demons in megaten
[2:29:15] <%baka_sugoi> ALL MY FRIEND ARE DEAD
[2:29:15] <%Deft_Thought> Narumi's your boss, not your friend
[2:29:25] <%Deft_Thought> Work/Life balance, man
[2:29:41] <%Deft_Thought> Sour... Puss. MY CAT BibleThump
[2:30:03] <Joestar1890> I hope Woolie talks to the dog again
[2:30:07] <dds333a> Doc Tsukumo has been cool the entire game LUL
[2:30:20] <%Deft_Thought> "I don't speak Sputnik" woolieKICKDAD
[2:30:26] <kingra> WOMEN
[2:30:41] <%LastHazzerd> two things actually, "girls are watching" and "Fuck you."
[2:30:42] <dds333a> Tsukumo also knows how to tell a girl's underwear from just their gait
[2:30:45] <alroy900> ok, so to activate your magic glow stick, you needed a pep talk from a yakusa, a journalist girl, a weirdo who likes rockets
[2:30:47] <Joestar1890> He DID build the rocket though, you know anyone else with a near and available rocket site?
[2:30:57] <cyberneticflower> gouto confirmed Herlock Sholmes stan
[2:30:59] <OmniSTylez> its true
[2:30:59] <brunoberserk> LUL LUL LUL
[2:31:02] <%Irridium> not wrong
[2:31:09] <ChouGokuOozaru> it has to be GOOD rollback, woolie
[2:31:15] <DSD24> @dds333a That's too specific to not be from something
[2:31:32] <dds333a> @dsd24 this very game LUL
[2:31:50] <DSD24> @dds333a Oh shit
[2:32:24] <cyberneticflower> Siegfried my booyyyy
[2:32:36] <cyberneticflower> sandal-hon is a classic
[2:32:37] <dds333a> oh yeah
[2:32:39] <+ninja_galt> so this game was from 2006
[2:32:41] <OmniSTylez> the end game
[2:32:42] <DSD24> Where's Metatron
[2:32:53] <dds333a> his brother is here LUL
[2:33:16] <DSD24> Yo we got Siegfried!
[2:33:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:33:17] <%LastHazzerd> "Mom, dad, Gouto is dead!" Gouto:"Dead tired of you trying to get me to play with you."
[2:33:25] <+ninja_galt> You gotta get the skeleton matador. Theres one in every game.
[2:33:30] <dds333a> I have NEVER made a bad Siegfried, he's always incredible
[2:33:41] <DSD24> He's got cool spin arms too
[2:33:54] <dds333a> @ninja_galt far from it, in fact LUL
[2:33:58] <DSD24> I love going for Orochi he's always cool
[2:34:07] <dds333a> But every game DOES have skeletons
[2:34:09] <cyberneticflower> Siegfried is always a must. (so is cu cuchulainn but he's usually early midge)
[2:34:13] <+ninja_galt> There was one in Nocturn and PErsona 4
[2:34:23] <cyberneticflower> I also always love lilith
[2:34:25] <OblivionSword1> mommy lilith
[2:34:26] <DSD24> Its the Black Samurai in SMT4
[2:34:29] <kingra> Lilliths design in these games is so cool
[2:34:32] <%Irridium> Kreygasm
[2:34:34] <dds333a> @ninja_galt yeah, but that's not every game LUL
[2:34:36] <%LastHazzerd> the first wife*
[2:34:46] <cyberneticflower> design is still the same through smt5 it's so good
[2:34:51] <dds333a> @dsd24 your mean Yuriko from SMT I Kappa
[2:34:52] <cyberneticflower> Lilith wanted to <redacted>
[2:34:54] <+Das_Prints> Lilith‚Äôs full demon design in SMT4 is wild.
[2:35:17] <DSD24> @dds333a That's her name! I forgot it thanks for clarifying
[2:35:30] <cyberneticflower> @Das_Prints oh dang I forgot about her smt4 design. it's back to this one for 5 though
[2:35:51] <dds333a> Yeah, among MANY other things, Yuriko's role in SMT IV is a direct reference to SMT I
[2:36:11] <Blinge_Sadface> t hot
[2:36:13] <dds333a> only instead of organizing a lynching, she is instead lynched
[2:36:32] <+LandOfTheWay> i wish the history classes in the persona games mentioned the time japan made a giant robot in the taisho era, cause this game is technically in continuity with them
[2:36:45] <Blinge_Sadface> is this turn based RPG like the others?
[2:36:53] <dds333a> @landoftheway we'll get to that LUL
[2:36:54] <cyberneticflower> @Blinge_Sadface nah this is more action-based
[2:36:57] <DSD24> Man I wish SMT Strange Journey got a dub
[2:36:58] <+ninja_galt> it's action
[2:37:12] <Blinge_Sadface> cheers boiz
[2:37:15] <cyberneticflower> strange journey made me a mastema stan
[2:37:25] <Blinge_Sadface> strange journey was awesome man
[2:37:32] <dds333a> the mainline games have been referencing SMT I for a goddamn minute
[2:37:38] <cyberneticflower> sure I never beat it bc I got lost in the final sector but it's still great
[2:37:52] <dds333a> Strange Journey starts very similarly as well
[2:37:56] <+LandOfTheWay> my username comes from the strange jouney minisoundtrack, so my opinion on that game should be clear
[2:38:08] <dds333a> @landoftheway LUL LUL
[2:38:18] <cyberneticflower> my favorite strange journey track was whatever played when mastema appeared
[2:38:19] <alroy900> strange journey's soundtrack is sick
[2:38:33] <cyberneticflower> remember when it came with the soundtrack and it was a data disc vs a mp3 lol
[2:38:53] <%ZweihanderSteve> slap that music on
[2:38:53] <dds333a> @cyberneticflower exactly LUL
[2:38:56] <%baka_sugoi> P BRAKE
[2:39:11] <Renzaku69> Damn, this away music is a vibe
[2:39:23] <Blinge_Sadface> @LandOfTheWay sector eridanus? yeah that was a great part of the game
[2:39:33] <DSD24> @cyberneticflower I loved the Boss theme
[2:39:59] <+LandOfTheWay> @blinge_sadface yep, easily my favorite sector and one of my favorite tracks

[3:40:52] <+pupil31> Fortunate Son starts playing
[3:40:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i thought hippies and nam were in the 60s
[3:41:11] <+LandOfTheWay> unrelated, but i still think it's wild that berserk, bayonetta, dmc, and ghost in the shell got crossovers with the SMT mobile game
[3:41:23] <Joestar1890> @cobalt_phoenix_ Mostly, the vietnam war ended in 1972
[3:41:29] <dds333a> @landoftheway don't forget Sonic too
[3:41:30] <%Irridium> careful you'll summon the DMCA demons
[3:41:56] <Renzaku69> OH shit your gonna have to fight the Charm boss dude again
[3:41:57] <Joestar1890> @LandOfTheWay If there's any properties that would mesh well with SMT, it would be those LUL
[3:42:28] <DSD24> Here comes the hype beam
[3:42:39] <+LandOfTheWay> @dds333a the sonic crossover was a bit different in the sense that it's literally the video game character being brought out of an arcade machine, whereas the others involved multiverse portals
[3:42:52] <DSD24> Localized Doubt in your area
[3:43:11] <Idon__> Can't believe Bayo and Dante didn't meet in Smash, but SMT gacha LUL
[3:43:12] <dds333a> @landoftheway I see, but I was only referring to the crossover side of things LUL
[3:43:15] <+LandOfTheWay> but yes @Joestar1890 there are 100% justified in-universe reasons for why all those settings could plausibly exist in the SMT multiverse
[3:43:25] <+LandOfTheWay> @dds333a fair enough
[3:43:35] <dds333a> LUL
[3:44:05] <Joestar1890> @LandOfTheWay I could see the Devil Summoner-verse leading into GITS in some way with DS' Cyberpunk aesthetics.
[3:44:37] <DSD24> NEver take the jacket off
[3:44:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:44:41] <OmniSTylez> pooping jacket?
[3:44:43] <rosemon5001> afternoon jacket
[3:44:50] <+vaderxyz1970> Destroy any chance of an 70's economic boom
[3:44:54] <+LandOfTheWay> @Joestar1890 they sadly don't go into it too much, but i really wanted to see how the demon summoning program could be compatible with the tech of the GitS world, like running it in a tachikoma or in the major's body
[3:44:56] <Joestar1890> Shitting jacket
[3:45:02] <+Catpurnicus> sounds like Shallow Gravy in here
[3:45:27] <Joestar1890> @LandOfTheWay Major with a COMP is TOO STRONG
[3:46:18] <DecoyBlackmage> military men with Demonica is basically the closest you get with GitS, currently, but hey if Sonic can be a demon in megaten why not throw the Major in there
[3:46:55] <DSD24> SPACE
[3:47:06] <DSD24> Also the moon landing
[3:47:15] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:47:22] <dds333a> @dsd24 right
[3:47:29] <drunken_lemur> Yeah, his stupid dance!
[3:47:46] <+LandOfTheWay> @DecoyBlackmage she doesn't get to summon demons herself, but she is a playable demon-esque unit in the smt mobile game
[3:47:52] <+LandOfTheWay> her and batou
[3:47:56] <+LandOfTheWay> oh, and tachikoma
[3:48:04] <drunken_lemur> They explode, right?
[3:48:08] <dds333a> there he is
[3:48:21] <%Irridium> there he is the scamp
[3:48:29] <dds333a> @drunken_lemur somewhat, their gimmick is to shoot beams and cast Mamudo
[3:49:02] <DecoyBlackmage> @LandOfTheWay Atlus does like crossovers
[3:49:04] <dds333a> Megido time
[3:49:07] <DSD24> One man can't have all that "Power"
[3:49:49] <Not_Paladin> Why are they in the dark? Ambiance?
[3:49:53] <Kira2993> why so many low level demons?
[3:50:21] <dds333a> @kira2993 it's incredibly easy to keep demons well past their usefulness in this game compared to others
[3:51:01] <dds333a> "usefulness", I say, since, well, they continue to be useful
