[0:31:14] <%Feralspirit41> Meat loaf is delicious anyone who says otherwise is insane

[0:31:22] <%Nested_Dreams> @lion_kun Might be the Canadian Roadwork Sawblades
[0:31:29] <%CptnCampy61> Bad meat loaf is real bad though
[0:31:31] <%cubbywolf> nah
[0:31:33] <Parapattern> They gotta be crispy
[0:31:34] <FoxInABeret> Yeah, meatloaf is totally one of those foods. People assume it's gross 'cause their parents made it badly.
[0:31:34] <HossMosh> brussel sprouts are the meatiest vegetables

[0:32:43] <+ColonelHandzLanza> Meatloaf was/is a peasant food maybe that's why
[0:32:43] <@Menitta> Hello

[0:32:47] <%Noonoox12> god, I love TSKR
[0:32:47] <Equirah> I think the meatloaf thing is more of "I've had it for the last 14 meals"
[0:32:52] <+Dova573> You think white people seasoned their meatloaf?
[0:32:53] <%JustYudha> I thinks its pretty good
[0:32:55] <leith_aziz> Never saw it actually
[0:32:56] <%Juriasu> speak spoke spake

[0:47:58] <leith_aziz> Cyberpunk TRIED that, but weirdly enough, it didnt work
[0:47:59] <%X2Eliah> And the button is implemented as well as in Cyberpunk 2077 :)
[0:48:00] <%HeroToxiko> like Dream Daddy
[0:48:02] <dds333a> Like how Illusion games had "panic buttons" where it hides the porn

[0:48:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Between this and ren.py, woolie knows his porn games
[0:49:00] <therealtacopancakes> mihn has that neurodivergent brain
[0:49:03] <%that__tj> @dds333a the panic button is actually baked into lots of H-Games from japan. Like how WASD is always movement for us ESC for them is the panic button
[0:49:05] <@Solidus_113> Stonewall Minh
[0:49:05] <%Seancicle> [oic]
[0:49:09] <leith_aziz> I do hope Cyberpunk fixes the state its in. I heard great things about the writing, but the bugs are EVERYWHERE, and some mechanics are lacking

[0:49:31] <aiutare47> @aeoneth Does the Twitch platform hold any liability? I‚Äôm not well versed in the legal responsibilities of platforms.

[0:56:13] <Blank9> we have anime souls games now, anime hitman is nothing
[0:56:20] <EternalJedi> @WoolieVersus I ordered from Artesian a couple weeks ago, do they email you when your build is about to come up on their build streams?

[0:58:04] <Qsmash_> Umbrella Chronicles, huh? Guess that's why I'm so confused.
[0:58:05] <%Javaa01> Woolie, just make a notepad on your phone

[0:58:10] <+Reverend_Roscoe> IVAN BB
[0:58:11] <Qsmash_> never played that one
[0:58:12] <andre11dr> RE ia probably the most inconsistent franchise ever LUL
[0:58:12] <RyuuAoi> What're we doing?
[0:58:19] <JetpackMcQuack> Surfing through the key art folder for Teppen cards
[0:58:19] <+KaijuUltimax> Never dig too deep into Capcom franchises, you'll find the weirdest shit. Unfortunately, Teppen seems to exist JUST to bring out that weird shit
[0:58:21] <%RyTYoung> @woolieversus What's the buzzing noise in the background?
[0:58:23] <+BigCoffee> umbrella chronicles is also a legit fun lightgun game
[0:58:24] <DandyDanteGameplay> so that buzzing?
[0:58:25] <%cache_22> I do hear a high-pitched whine sound. Like coil whine.
[0:58:27] <therealtacopancakes> yo the JSRF gogglees on tyrants
[0:58:29] <DandyDanteGameplay> is it a bug?
[0:58:33] <%X2Eliah> @RyuuAoi according to the past 10 minutes of discussion, some kind of anime porn simulator
[0:58:36] <kainsonofdeath> damn those tyrants look like daft punk
[0:58:37] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ Hype
[0:58:39] <leith_aziz> Different subject, but I hope Strive does well and gets enough attention for a good time. People are hyped right now, and I hope that hype continues. Im basically saying I hope it gets close to mainstream attention, because it has the chance to right now.
[0:58:40] <WanderingYoren> remember the twins from the matrix, this is them now, feel OLD YET?
[0:58:41] <@Menitta> Menu narration cool
[0:58:43] <DatAsuna> white tyrants huh? Surely that could never exist
[0:58:49] <%X2Eliah> Ohhhh that is tiny
[0:58:50] <majindusto> THE BUZZING
[0:58:53] <%X2Eliah> tiny tiny UI
[0:58:54] <%johnny_gogo> they're is so much microphone whine
[0:58:55] <%X2Eliah> kinda

[0:59:29] <pmda2126> somebody doing some work?
[0:59:30] <DandyDanteGameplay> thank God
[0:59:30] <SunsetJack> It is gone.
[0:59:34] <DandyDanteGameplay> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:59:39] <%Lion_kun> That buzz has been on the whole time
[0:59:40] <andre11dr> Ok now it's gone
[0:59:41] <+Awarets> its not gone the mics are just muted while they try and fix it
[0:59:42] <Applecannon63> ah nvm
[0:59:43] <%Lion_kun> Ahhhhh
[0:59:44] <+thfiddles> it sounds like nirnroot lmao
[0:59:47] <DandyDanteGameplay> that was driving me insane lol
[0:59:48] <RyuuAoi> Woolie already breaking shit?
[0:59:49] <%RyTYoung> tyty
[0:59:55] <%mitchteck> It‚Äôs gone now
[0:59:58] <Yonvi> i thought it was a nirnroot ambient track lmfao
[1:00:04] <SunsetJack> Buzz is back
[1:00:06] <Ipsenscastle> still there yeah
[1:00:09] <%Javaa01> It's still a bit buzzy
[1:00:10] <+Awarets> its still there
[1:00:12] <andre11dr> Yeah it's definitely still there
[1:00:12] <pmda2126> yeah
[1:00:12] <%johnny_gogo> its a bit lower now
[1:00:12] <Deasmeister> Buzz is back
[1:00:13] <%Mrbaconator> still there
[1:00:14] <%X2Eliah> hmmm barely but yeah
[1:00:17] <RyuuAoi> YOUR HOT
[1:00:19] <waffleandman> chat you have sharp ears LUL
[1:00:21] <%patriotrenegade> its almost inaudible
[1:00:22] <Spoofy16> yes
[1:00:23] <RyuuAoi> You're
[1:00:23] <%Juriasu> it's only there when you are talking
[1:00:25] <%Lion_kun> Yes
[1:00:26] <+Awarets> its not a huge deal if you cant figure out how to fix it
[1:00:27] <%mitchteck> Yes
[1:00:28] <%MrPedrovsky> Yes
[1:00:28] <%Noonoox12> oh god my tinnitus is hiding it. I can't tell at all
[1:00:29] <%RyTYoung> Yeah
[1:00:30] <@Solidus_113> noise gate?
[1:00:31] <EternalJedi> it's more like a sharp whine
[1:00:38] <Clundy> Jiggle the audio wires?
[1:00:40] <%MrPedrovsky> @woolieversus Like a mosquito behind an ear
[1:00:45] <Ipsenscastle> it might be more audible on headphones than speakers
[1:00:46] <%X2Eliah> It definitely sounds like an electrical feedback/leak
[1:00:57] <ZComiX> The buzz is from the game. It‚Äôs from the enemy type on the BG
[1:01:06] <EternalJedi> it's like a circular saw from really far away
[1:01:07] <%X2Eliah> And yeah it's high pitched so e.g. laptop speakers or 2.0 speakers might totally hide it
[1:01:09] <%johnny_gogo> @Ipsenscastle to fair everything is
[1:01:09] <ZComiX> bc there are bugs
[1:01:12] <RyuuAoi> You should probably be using the Kirby headphones. That's the real issue here.

[1:01:38] <ronin19xx> Random ass question, but is it difficult to set up a DSLR camera on a PC for video calls?
[1:01:42] <mankeymania> advance darkness
[1:01:42] <dds333a> I remember a sound like this coming from the co-worker's desk at my old job, and it was torture
[1:01:43] <brunoberserk> sorry i am late , so what i miss ?
[1:01:43] <Jashter18> Whelp that's a stream everybody
[1:01:55] <+b_aleph> @brunoberserk QA
[1:01:58] <dds333a> not too loud to disrupt, not too quiet to ignore
[1:01:59] <leith_aziz> With Strive getting a lot of attention from all fighting game players, specifically casuals from DBFZ, and it being a mainline EVO game, is there a chance it can gain mainstream attention ? I hope it can gain that audience, even for a month or two.
[1:02:02] <RyuuAoi> IN THE DARK *guitar riff* IN THE DARK
[1:02:03] <%X2Eliah> @ronin19xx Depends on the camera. Can be doable on some, some cams need firmware hacking, some are just lol nope

[1:03:06] <$thomassolorio> Back in the womb, it's much too real In pumps life that I must feel But can't look forward to reveal Look to the time when I'll live Fed through the tube that sticks in me Just like a wartime novelty Tied to machines that make me be Cut this life off from me
[1:03:06] <WanderingYoren> they'll come back and say they finished the game
[1:03:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> Have I gone deaf? I can't see anything

[1:03:19] <+b_aleph> The stream is having "the troubles"
[1:03:20] <exnuart> did woolie break the stream?
[1:03:24] <andre11dr> @leith_aziz At the end of the day it will sell good but will it be MAIN STREAM, no the only main stream games are MK and Smash
[1:03:26] <mankeymania> reggie and woolie finally took their final form
[1:03:26] <samwantsham> big bruh moment

[1:03:41] <Jetsfantasy> I think GG is at it's best chance of getting itself out there. Having an anime fighter be mainstream is a big ask, but it probably won't stay as niche as it has @leith_aziz
[1:03:41] <%X2Eliah> I blame Reginald

[1:04:10] <%KiwamiKiryu> I guess Origin is at fault?
