[0:55:04] <%KAISERWAVE> We actually had an EVO Japan side tournament for this
[0:55:04] <nothuzad> I mean you can play granblue again in 1 or 2 months when the entire S1 pass is out :V
[0:55:09] <%Superbro64> you definitely arent seeing love heart or the pachinko girls again tho. They are gone forever
[0:55:15] <+PJSmooth> because it makes her uncomfortable
[0:55:21] <DSD24> Woolie loves Nelsons car gloves

[0:56:04] <Dragon_Batman> Yup Fem Iori
[0:56:09] <kingkeldeo31> Don't question their clothing, Kukri somehow gets powerful from the girls' embarassment
[0:56:11] <Ryong> Nakoruru's dagger also doesn't want anything to do with this whole deal
[0:56:11] <+PJSmooth> @jiggy_snipe kukri wanted to make all the girls in this as uncomfortable as possible
[0:56:14] <laguerrilha> That birb wants no part in this travesty
[0:56:20] <Ryong> which is why it only shows up during moves that use it
[0:56:23] <laguerrilha> it has a reputation to mantain

[1:03:30] <Kalinflip> Personally I think Snk did a bad job by even making this game in the first place
[1:03:42] <SuckPuppet> they presented the game perfectly well

[3:21:40] <%OldManJEWc> I will actually pick this up real good quick and try and play. big hype lol
[3:21:51] <Finakala> Did Woolie ever play Arcana Heart on stream?
[3:22:01] <Chronoreyer> once again, for anyone looking to try this game out, its actually pretty easy to learn to play!
[3:22:03] <@Solidus_113> nope
[3:22:35] <Chronoreyer> combos are not difficult and pretty straightforward, neutral is pretty freeform
[3:22:36] <Das_Wood> i just got here was that a stand?
[3:22:45] <SilverInferno3> Essentially yes
[3:22:59] <GeltonZ> Hermes is a summoner so she has like 3 or 4 stands
[3:23:07] <SilverInferno3> If it's the Star Platinum one then yes in every way
[3:23:21] <NeroInfinite> rip captain
[3:23:25] <Chronoreyer> thats the setplay super
[3:23:27] <@Solidus_113> Time to retire, Sagit

[3:23:35] <%Solidnick18> i'm pretty bad at fight games but i like watching woolieMIRIN
[3:23:53] <%Exiliator> 🔔 🔔
[3:23:57] <%winds_0f_change> is the red stand supposed to be magicians red?
[3:24:05] <GeltonZ> This game is made by the people who made Super Cosplay Wars so there are a LOT of anime references in here. Celia 2 Kai's entire moveset is based on Shin Getter Robo
[3:24:11] <Hoarseplay> Damn. My PS4 has to update.
[3:24:24] <chronoxgp> I was researching this game and came across a listing for "Arcana Heart 3: Love Max Six Stars Xtend!!!!
[3:24:27] <%Exiliator> 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔
[3:24:37] <SilverInferno3> @GeltonZ Does that include the move where her boobs explode
[3:24:38] <@Solidus_113> tragic
[3:24:40] <%Solidnick18> Ring your bell
[3:24:43] <@Solidus_113> I can't believe Sagit is dead
[3:24:51] <SilverInferno3> Gave it your best dood
[3:25:02] <mephium> he came back from the dead to die again
[3:25:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's 20 bucks
[3:25:10] <%Exiliator> yeah on pc :(
[3:25:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> and it downloads fuast
[3:25:13] <@Solidus_113> it's $4 on PC
[3:25:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> *fast
[3:25:17] <SilverInferno3> Reggie, quote machine today
[3:25:22] <Finakala> Arcana Heart is fun @chronoxgp
[3:25:29] <Hoarseplay> This is probably the most advertising this game ever got and that's really sad.
[3:25:38] <%Irridium> In the first age...
[3:25:41] <chronoxgp> arcana heart has some crunchy pixel art
[3:25:41] <%Exiliator> Real OG
[3:25:43] <%Solidnick18> The old guard
[3:25:46] <Chronoreyer> hoarseplay you are actually 100% correct
[3:25:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> wish i actually was good at fight games
[3:25:50] <Hoarseplay> Oh yeah, Max played this for like, a week.
[3:25:51] <Chronoreyer> and it really sucks
[3:26:09] <Chronoreyer> I tried to get people to pick up and enter tournaments for this game for a while
[3:26:16] <Finakala> I do remember hearing about Chaos Code a few years ago but never got around to picking it up
[3:26:24] <Chronoreyer> in the end there was a handful of people in our reigon that played and got pretty good, but thats about it
[3:26:37] <Finakala> Oh yeah this is Akihabara alright
[3:26:44] <Hoarseplay> Cthylla is Cthulhu's daughter and also a magical girl.
[3:26:45] <Finakala> I recognize it
[3:26:45] <Chronoreyer> small pockets of pretty good people in like 5 different reigons maybe
[3:26:48] <chronoxgp> futa cafe right on the side

[3:29:40] <@chesterr01> @geltonz 👍👍
[3:30:06] <GeltonZ> This game has that Waku Waku 7 energy to it. It's so wonderfully goofy.
[3:30:20] <GeltonZ> And yes, Cthylla is Cthulu's daughter.
[3:30:51] <SilverInferno3> That's rad
[3:30:54] <Finakala> Bravo looks super fun to play

[3:32:40] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[3:32:45] <Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus command normals in this game are like kof, if you chain into it the move has different properties
[3:32:48] <%yeknomlive> is this for glory?
[3:32:52] <SilverInferno3> What a god, of a gamer
[3:33:14] <+snarfton23> jermaMars

[3:34:26] <SilverInferno3> Bye @Exiliator KonCha
[3:34:31] <Hoarseplay> @chromdad It's fun and busted in all the right ways.
[3:34:33] <Chronoreyer> in the vanilla version of this game, kudlak had a fireball that was +1 anywhere on the screen
[3:34:34] <Finakala> Night @Exiliator
[3:34:35] <Chronoreyer> he was a bastard
[3:34:44] <GeltonZ> This is actually in my top 5 favorite fighters of all time
[3:35:03] <Finakala> Is this guy just summoning RE4 Regenerators
[3:35:10] <%drefizz> LOL
[3:35:17] <chromdad> Busted fun > balanced limited “fun”
[3:35:48] <Hoarseplay> This game is absolute insanity at high level.
[3:36:02] <SilverInferno3> Fuck MvC2 put this in Evo
[3:36:08] <SilverInferno3> Wiz you coward
[3:36:15] <Hoarseplay> It was at EVO_JP
[3:36:21] <Das_Wood> we got more stands baby
[3:36:21] <Hoarseplay> Side tournament, but still.
[3:36:33] <SilverInferno3> I demand main stage
[3:36:36] <Finakala> To be fair the best game at EVO last year was Windjammers don't @ me
[3:36:51] <%jiggy_snipe> sucks about the sequel, maybe it would have been another UNIST
[3:36:54] <chromdad> Why @ the truth
[3:36:59] <ThousandDogs> who's gonna @ you when you right
[3:37:00] <kaine_west> Get rid of smasat EVO instead Kappa
[3:37:05] <Chronoreyer> this game would never have been another unist
[3:37:09] <Chronoreyer> its too old for most people
[3:37:12] <kaine_west> Smash
[3:37:21] <%Irridium> replace every game with this. every bracket. Fuck it.
[3:37:35] <chromdad> Too mich smash player money and attendants and views
[3:37:43] <mr_miyagucci> lets have an idie evo with this and skullgirls
[3:37:45] <SilverInferno3> If this game got GGPO it'd be popular, I swear
[3:37:54] <%Superbro64> its kinda funny how people think the sequel was teased a few weeks back, there was a trailer at least a year and a half ago
[3:37:58] <Chronoreyer> theres a roll
[3:37:59] <Chronoreyer> lol
[3:38:08] <GeltonZ> The problem is that the main guy behind this game died 2 years ago, that's why NEXT was cancelled. His brother tried to continue without him but couldn't.
[3:38:08] <%Superbro64> I do hope the dev gets back on his feet
[3:38:09] <SilverInferno3> Also shit was that a perfect?
[3:38:12] <Man_in_the_Red> @silverinferno3 no... no it wont
[3:38:12] <Finakala> I'm still disappointed and surprised how little rep Skullgirls seems to get
[3:38:18] <kaine_west> This game rocks
[3:38:23] <Man_in_the_Red> anyone else play Skullgirls Kappa
[3:38:25] <arkv01> @GeltonZ oh fuck FeelsBadMan
[3:38:34] <Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus can I get the runback
[3:38:38] <Man_in_the_Red> trick question Kappa
[3:38:38] <arkv01> we all play skullgirls... in our hearts
[3:38:46] <Finakala> :<
[3:38:47] <SilverInferno3> @Man_in_the_Red Yeah I was just joking lol
[3:38:55] <Hoarseplay> There's a Boss variant of every character. Like Gold characters in Guilty Gear.
[3:38:57] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Yo I'm scisless thanks for the match woolie
[3:39:00] <Hoarseplay> You haveto buy them.
[3:39:01] <kaine_west> No more sequel feelsbadman

[3:39:52] <SilverInferno3> Nun = fetish for Woolie
[3:40:06] <Applecannon63> I mean Kyrie
[3:40:08] <Finakala> I want to try to learn Cthylla since I love her design but she looks like a character I won't get on with gameplay wise
[3:40:11] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL I see Woolie
[3:40:21] <%Irridium> so that's what woolie likes
[3:40:37] <Hoarseplay> @Finakala Characters are all really simple to get into if you have a basic understanding of fighting games.
[3:41:06] <Finakala> I'll give everyone a shot tomorrow and see what feels good
[3:41:23] <Hoarseplay> Also, everything juggles in this game. IT's super nuts.

[3:46:38] <Finakala> Holy shit that damage
[3:46:38] <Man_in_the_Red> @superbro64 Max Kappa
[3:46:38] <SilverInferno3> THAT WAS SEXY AS HELL
[3:46:41] <%jiggy_snipe> did Woolie fight his Vein?
[3:46:44] <%Irridium> okay, okay. reggie won the moral victory
[3:46:46] <Chronoreyer> haha
[3:46:47] <%Superbro64> @man_in_the_red Kappa
[3:46:50] <Finakala> Code Vein confirmed
[3:47:02] <Man_in_the_Red> i'd bring my scrubby lupin if i was wired now... question, is powerline fine for netplay or is it too volatile
[3:47:05] <SilverInferno3> the BEST super
[3:47:11] <SilverInferno3> But GG Crono
[3:47:21] <@Solidus_113> Captain about to lose again
[3:47:29] <SilverInferno3> DO IT CAP
[3:47:34] <Chronoreyer> That was more appropriate for what the game's offense actually looks like
[3:47:39] <SilverInferno3> USE THOSE TIDDIES
[3:47:49] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:47:51] <Chronoreyer> this game has a universal parry, and sometimes you have to parry to get out
[3:47:54] <mephium> reggie going all out PogChamp
[3:47:54] <%jiggy_snipe> oof
[3:47:57] <NeroInfinite> Brap
[3:48:01] <%Superbro64> one of these days I will see max mode combos online
[3:48:06] <%Superbro64> one day...
[3:48:23] <%Superbro64> good stuff there @chronoreyer
[3:48:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[3:48:32] <Chronoreyer> I could do vein's max combo on netplay but its not really worth it
[3:48:37] <Chronoreyer> meter is too valuable for neutral
[3:48:46] <+NotHereToStream> do it for the style
[3:48:46] <%Superbro64> but the STYLE points tho
[3:48:59] <Chronoreyer> haha, I think the big boy bnb is cooler than the max mode combo
[3:49:01] <SilverInferno3> Thata boy
[3:49:01] <mephium> is he pretending? NotLikeThis
[3:49:03] <Chronoreyer> his is pretty easy
[3:49:12] <%Irridium> LUL
[3:49:13] <Chronoreyer> but the big boy combo has like 3 2f rejump links
[3:49:14] <SilverInferno3> RAW
[3:49:16] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[3:49:16] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:49:19] <%Superbro64> is max combos particularly hard to do on netplay?
[3:49:26] <Chronoreyer> depends on the character
[3:49:39] <@Solidus_113> Reggie playing woolieFUN
