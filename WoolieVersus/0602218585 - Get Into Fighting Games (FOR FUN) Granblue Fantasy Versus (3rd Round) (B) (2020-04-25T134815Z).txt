[0:04:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that white color looke really nice on lancy
[0:04:50] <skewerstar> Can't they just patch in Rollback like they did with MKXL?
[0:04:57] <+BaikenAndEggs> No
[0:05:09] <%Irridium> they could but that'd take a lot of time, money, and work, so no
[0:05:12] <0cash> probably no interest in it annyway

[0:05:19] <%nothuzad> skewerstar for MKX it also meant to rework the engine

[0:07:31] <%Zerotoad5> Can we get Woolie to watch Zooey trailer

[0:12:02] <neet98> dont let Vira hear that though
[0:12:09] <+BaikenAndEggs> If Strive's Rollback is a success, it'll mean that all future ASW games surely have it. The future looks bright.
[0:12:11] <0cash> theere
[0:12:21] <+ghostfaceninja_> Last Blade 2 rollback? where? Steam? Fightcade?
[0:12:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> this stream started out as a woolieFUN starting to feel like a woolieGLORY
[0:12:37] <artificiallynatural> even if it's not a success, they'd probably move the online to rollback anyway since they'd have developed the system
[0:12:39] <+fizzguy47> Does Reggie still play with the spear girl anymore?
[0:12:45] <artificiallynatural> last blade 2 rollback on steam.
[0:12:48] <%Wool> @fizzguy47 no
[0:12:56] <artificiallynatural> it's in beta testing right now

[0:13:36] <+Grayhammatter> too cheeky woolz
[0:13:50] <%nothuzad> BaikenAndEggs well MvCI had decent rollback
[0:13:58] <%nothuzad> so the second version was good - but the game not so much V:
[0:14:00] <skewerstar> @monstercar329 I sure hope so, because it really feels like that fiasco poisoned the Rollback well in Japan.
[0:14:04] <%nothuzad> well in regards to hype
[0:14:05] <+tearfuldevil> but it was mvci lol

[0:14:16] <+BaikenAndEggs> True
[0:14:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> any1 else feel if any other game was in the shape sfv was at launch it'd be dead in the water?

[0:15:08] <neet98> well she is in her primal form so rose queen
[0:15:10] <+Grayhammatter> the trades
[0:15:14] <+BaikenAndEggs> SF survived thanks to it's name
[0:15:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> been a while since reggie and wolz were equal power level wise, this is very fun
[0:15:37] <%nothuzad> ye thos ehave been fun sets although reggies experience clearly shows
[0:15:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> alright. I just remember really not liking it at launch I felt like I was just hating sometimes lol
[0:15:44] <+ghostfaceninja_> Lanc is Woolie's main?
[0:15:46] <%Irridium> SFV online was bad and they only got around to (kinda) fixing it after One Guy fixed it
[0:15:47] <+fizzguy47> Is the dmg in this game high, or is it just me?
[0:15:48] <%Jetzord> It's murdaa
[0:15:48] <@Solidus_113> It seems to be a rare occurrence, when Reggie is the one stomping in GIFG
[0:15:54] <Brofarian> "equal"?
[0:15:54] <CookieDoughFK> Always shortcut DP
[0:15:57] <YakumoYomi> Agreed. SF survived purely on the strength of the brand (and Capcom not wanting it to die).
[0:15:59] <+tearfuldevil> @ghostfaceninja_ yeah, although woolie hasn't played much
[0:16:20] <Triplicat> it would be even on their fundamentals if woolie were actually playing lance but he's not
[0:16:30] <Triplicat> reggie is doing kat things
[0:16:44] <skewerstar> Really hoping 5* Grand Rosetta gets a Rose Queen outfit!
[0:16:48] <+BaikenAndEggs> Reggie shows us that he plays. Woolie neess to get his training on FOR GLORY.

[0:18:55] <%nothuzad> Irridium I mean lance is top tier too
[0:18:58] <Triplicat> lance does not have those unless it's CH AA, he has a mid-high damage corner combo that leads to oki I can drop in chat but it's probably too long to learn on the fly
[0:19:00] <%MisterArcanine> Kat is incredible she does insane damage and she has an option for pretty much everything
[0:19:12] <neet98> 20 wins?

[0:20:08] <%Rhinoprotoss> Maybe Woolie needs to stop burning his rekkas on ex
[0:20:12] <%Thunderhog> it's just a lot of labbing

[0:21:21] <Lamokmok> Time to pick Gran, Woolie.
[0:21:26] <neet98> reggie is feeling himself

[0:21:28] <%nothuzad> and lance already is top tier V:
[0:21:29] <%Conzanagi> Lance is in the top 5
[0:21:34] <Brofarian> Living proof that Reggie's waifu is objectively better than yours
[0:21:35] <%MisterArcanine> Katalina is Mitsuru on steroids
[0:21:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I only have fun winning" - Reggie
[0:21:41] <+tearfuldevil> hes not as good as kat or gran, but hes pretty good
[0:21:44] <snickers_md> lance got dem mix ups tho
[0:22:03] <+BaikenAndEggs> What's funny is she's the only chara with 3 special moves
[0:22:04] <0cash> Playing against lance is suffering - Ferry gang

[0:24:50] <%nothuzad> skewerstar I think both of them were made at about the same time
[0:25:04] <+ghostfaceninja_> i believe the correct term is gyaru Kappa
[0:25:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1252638347819986945
[0:25:11] <Triplicat> lolll
[0:25:21] <Triplicat> he's allowed
[0:25:30] <Triplicat> (buttons) 66H c.HH 214LL c.H 214LL delay 2L 236H
[0:25:59] <Triplicat> delay c.M 236H is easier but can be rolled through
[0:26:21] <Brofarian> It's good to see that even with the shut downs Woolie is getting taken to school
[0:26:31] <%Thunderhog> Close H is your friend as lancelot
[0:26:34] <+tearfuldevil> @SirGO0SE same
[0:26:35] <%nothuzad> reggie put in some work Brofarian :)
[0:26:48] <neet98> an unpopular pick that i really want for dlc is Yuisis
[0:26:49] <+tearfuldevil> @Brofarian LUL
[0:26:52] <CookieDoughFK> 50%
[0:26:53] <%SuperKirby24> 40% monkaS
[0:26:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> ALMOST forgot about tonight
[0:27:10] <+BaikenAndEggs> Hence wh lance is #1
[0:27:12] <%Thunderhog> Or you can confirm into super
[0:27:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> !schedule
[0:27:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1252638347819986945
[0:27:20] <Triplicat> that's that
[0:27:31] <Monstercar329> I want Beatrix, because glass cannon playstyle.
[0:27:41] <%Conzanagi> 50% and not even in the corner
[0:27:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yo Bea would be nice
[0:27:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> wait what? MUGEN??
[0:27:54] <Brofarian> I want that one demon lady with the sleepy eyes and the big horns...and the huge tiddies
[0:28:00] <+BaikenAndEggs> Yuisis would be so cool
[0:28:05] <0cash> that damage was a bit low thought, not worth using the super
[0:28:14] <TaylorTot> never lvl 1 with lance at end of combos that super scales SO MUCH
[0:28:15] <neet98> Yuisis(fire) though
[0:28:16] <%SirGO0SE> i want yuel? is that the right name? ninja waifu?
[0:28:18] <Monstercar329> Mugen is the dream pick. SSGSS Broly.
[0:28:23] <neet98> the gang boss lady
[0:28:26] <+BaikenAndEggs> Of course
[0:28:35] <Triplicat> if you're going to super in the corner with lance you do it after the first c.H
[0:28:36] <+ghostfaceninja_> GIFG MUGEN??
[0:28:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo, who wants to get in some practice with me before we fight woolie and reggie?
[0:28:44] <Triplicat> so buttons 66H c.H either super
[0:28:53] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver I'm down
[0:28:54] <+BaikenAndEggs> I just want Danua. Gimmy a puppet chara
[0:28:56] <@Solidus_113> Mugen will be in about an hour and a bit
[0:28:57] <%MisterArcanine> Goku vs Homer Simpson mugen?
[0:29:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @BaikenAndEggs What about Orchis
[0:29:05] <DSD24> @SirGO0SE If she has black hair then you are thinking of Yuel
[0:29:08] <%Zerotoad5> I think Orchis for puppet char
[0:29:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> awesom @Irridium which lobby you wanna meet in
[0:29:11] <%Thunderhog> It's 2 hits, but it's 1 button
[0:29:13] <Brofarian> let me tab into Gelbooru to see which characters they need to add
[0:29:14] <+mrcooperblack> whenz saltybet?
[0:29:18] <neet98> orchis is prob in
[0:29:26] <Monstercar329> Orchid would be a better puppet character.
[0:29:27] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver let's go to the bottom
[0:29:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> yosh
[0:29:43] <Triplicat> c.H(2)H 214LL
[0:29:47] <+BaikenAndEggs> Meh
[0:29:49] <Triplicat> ugly in notation but lol
[0:30:07] <+tearfuldevil> @Brofarian im not saying that before GBVS i only knew GB from doujins and "fanart" but..........
[0:30:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, in the mexico lobby @Irridium
[0:30:19] <+BaikenAndEggs> Need more Draph
[0:30:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I also feel like Cagliostro is a given
[0:30:32] <+BaikenAndEggs> Oh yeah
[0:30:42] <Brofarian> @tearknack buuuuuuut......
[0:30:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I'm fine with cagliostro tbh, she has nice visuals
[0:30:50] <Monstercar329> Cagliostro sealed Bubs, so most likely in S2.
[0:30:51] <+BaikenAndEggs> I'm sure they'll be in
[0:31:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> plus gbvs could use a mage character
[0:31:08] <%Zerotoad5> Rekka will work but you want the mix
[0:31:13] <+tearfuldevil> i recall hearing cagliostro is, sort of, another trans character?
[0:31:22] <Triplicat> light rekka is fine for damage but you really want to make them tech into EX fireball
[0:31:24] <NocturnalRites> I'd like to see Seofon or Eahta
[0:31:28] <neet98> Black knight would be cool
[0:31:31] <elrey745> Old man loli is confirmed?
[0:31:38] <Monstercar329> @tearknack basically Saga of Tanya the evil.
[0:31:43] <+tearfuldevil> hmm
[0:31:51] <neet98> they can make a black knight + orchid double trailer
[0:32:22] <elrey745> They'll definitely add Sandalphon eventually
[0:32:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:32:23] <NocturnalRites> or bring in Drang and Sturm
[0:32:32] <%Thunderhog> Also that anti air combo works on counter hit 22H
[0:32:33] <Monstercar329> Seofon could be the last character. Gotta have Mr. Unlimited Blade Works.
[0:32:35] <%nothuzad> neet98 apollo but without her black knight armor :)
[0:32:40] <neet98> coward
[0:32:56] <%laserbeaming> So, all this Reggie know because of matchup knowledge I assume?
[0:32:58] <+tearfuldevil> wanting any character without armour = coward
[0:32:59] <neet98> fcking coward
[0:33:01] <%nothuzad> neet98 no I mean thats what they are gonna do :V
[0:33:08] <+BaikenAndEggs> Thinking about it, yeah, I think Orchid would make the better puppet chara.
[0:33:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> My current list? Yodarha, Ghandagoza, Ilsa, Anila, Ayer, Dante, Sen, Razia
[0:33:12] <+tearfuldevil> zero suit samus is for cowards
[0:33:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack cagliostro was originally a frail guy and to overcome that he invented alchemy and changed bodies many times, and basically lived for centuries like that just changing bodies. His current body is the one he has kept for the longest, but he's into being a girl so currently he's referred to with femalle pronouns
[0:33:21] <+tearfuldevil> keep the armour on during sex
[0:33:25] <neet98> the armour is so strong
[0:33:35] <%laserbeaming> The Armor is all the Protection you need
[0:33:36] <+tearfuldevil> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ huh. neat
[0:33:36] <+Runato> "Apollonia but with the leotard" Kappa
[0:33:42] <elrey745> Discard Samus, fuck the armor
[0:33:48] <%nothuzad> Runato lul
[0:33:51] <NocturnalRites> We also need a gun character like Silvaor Eugen if his VA hadn't passed
[0:33:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'M WAITING
[0:33:59] <neet98> black knight armour is the best
[0:34:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> LOBBY
[0:34:04] <%Jetzord> Question, are we doing Shades of Manhattan 2 or 1?
[0:34:07] <+Grayhammatter> the captain is waiting
[0:34:08] <@Solidus_113> Is Jimmy waiting around too?
[0:34:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> they are ALL almost empty
[0:34:18] <BackwardCap> 8
[0:34:18] <%Wool> 9 is max
[0:34:18] <neet98> the gun character is guaranteed Silva
[0:34:18] <+tearfuldevil> jimmy was around earlier
[0:34:20] <%nothuzad> I think its 8
[0:34:21] <%nothuzad> or 9
[0:34:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> demon time ðŸ˜ˆ
[0:34:26] <%Conzanagi> 8 or 9
[0:34:28] <%Irridium> @CaptainPileDriver yo they startin' body me
[0:34:29] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Limit of 8, but you can set it to queue people up
[0:34:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> almost ALL the lobby's are empty
[0:34:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack yeah it's not overly original but it's nice enough, also curious thing is she's still pretty insecure about her original body's frailty, though she mostly hides that behind MILLIONS of layers of smugness
[0:34:41] <Brofarian> Are the rooms as bad as the Guilty Gear beta? Because those were BAAAAAAAAD
[0:34:44] <GKannel> rashidoooo
[0:34:52] <+Grayhammatter> rashidoo
[0:34:54] <%nintega010> Trying to practice Soriz
[0:34:55] <%Conzanagi> You can get a queue going in a room
[0:34:56] <Zayasu> theres the music cirComfy
[0:34:57] <Monstercar329> I'd rather have Tien for the gun rep.
[0:35:02] <%nothuzad> Brofarian no all ASW lobby systems apart from strive are perfectly fine
[0:35:07] <+BaikenAndEggs> Cucouroux is the most likely gun chara imo
[0:35:08] <+SeventhVice> Ilsa gun rep
[0:35:10] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:35:12] <+tearfuldevil> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ i do think messing with gender norms when it comes to immortal shapeshifting/bodyswitching characters is neat

[0:37:53] <+tearfuldevil> the web swing is cool though
[0:37:54] <%laserbeaming> At least she tells you to watch your feet

[1:00:21] <%SuperKirby24> what is that move, I swear I've seen a gif of that train like thing
[1:00:21] <%SirGO0SE> NONE of his fights are real, they're all dreams and bar stories @WoolieVersus

[1:00:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @WoolieVersus They're genre savvy in that they're dreaming/telling stories about this
[1:00:28] <+DrDenorax> The whole thign with them is that every fight theyre in, is a makebelieve fight.
[1:00:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> just guys being dudes
[1:00:29] <elrey745> @WoolieVersus They're just three bros living their best life LUL

[1:01:01] <C4m3r0n0409> JEEEZ
[1:01:06] <flowdere> they have 0 fighting ability in mobile game?
[1:01:10] <Monstercar329> The storytelling is based on the Lowain event, where they have dream fights.
[1:01:11] <+xeros720> even the game was playing the "you fuckin died" music

[1:22:50] <%nintega010> @yeknomlive they make his defense better in fundoshi mode

[1:22:54] <TigerClaws12> Reggie you're a god damn magazine rn LUL
[1:22:54] <%SirGO0SE> wait you ignore the fundoshi install? or just the super? because the guard break move he gains (not guard break super) is fucking bitchin

[1:23:00] <0cash> Dude is S-4
[1:23:10] <ChansonNoire> his install is a trap pretty much.
[1:23:11] <%yeknomlive> i know what it does im asking if it's worth building stacks
[1:23:16] <0cash> Reggie should run it back with katarina
[1:23:16] <ChansonNoire> its not
[1:23:18] <+Epiren> because the install super usually isn't worth doing over the regular damage super

[1:45:04] <elrey745> @Brofarian thats just dark souls
[1:45:07] <%Superbro64> My issue is that the solution you seek, which is VERY character specific, is not apparent
[1:45:09] <%optimasmaximas> unless you're sonicfox @WoolieVersus
[1:45:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> if you have an ego in fighting games it'll be crushed until you get THAT EGO BACK
[1:45:11] <%Kriss1827> if youre into fighting games you're into taking loses more than wins
[1:45:12] <%Irridium> everyone's got more losses than wins
[1:45:15] <%nothuzad> optimasmaximas I mean its kinda what you have to get used to in fighting games
[1:45:16] <%BinaryFireball> any competitive game
[1:45:19] <%BinaryFireball> is very humbling
[1:45:24] <%BinaryFireball> and makes you stronk
