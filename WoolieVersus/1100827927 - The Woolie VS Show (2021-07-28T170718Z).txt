[0:06:42] <%madmanrambler> strive*
[0:06:42] <meatman_noplan> its a good game
[0:06:50] <%madmanrambler> playing axl is just shockingly fun
[0:07:07] <%madmanrambler> only problem is there aren't a ton of pro axls to watch
[0:07:09] <TheMagneticDragon> DISCO DANCING BAY BAY
[0:07:24] <eccentricpersona> does anyone actually use his time stop ability? ive never encountered an axl who does
[0:07:32] <s_unnyd> time to get those clothes on, woolie
[0:07:38] <s_unnyd> time to go to work in the shit factory
[0:07:51] <%LemonAgeKK> LemonAgeKK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Woolie excited to watch more Disco, keep up the great work and your health
[0:09:11] <%madmanrambler> @eccentricpersona there is some appeal there, its got some cooking to it, but having to set it up before you play it with its very small activation window is a big ask
[0:09:19] <%madmanrambler> especially when you can RC and get safe instead
[0:09:28] <spaceitaly> will woolie learn the mysteries of the spinal cord tonight? who knows, but I'm excited to find out

[0:12:01] <+Roasted_Pheasant> @BallerSwagBro9k V a cool guy
[0:12:04] <eccentricpersona> but im trying em all out first to see which one i vibe with
[0:13:02] <%madmanrambler> its a good call, I just clicked with axl
[0:13:21] <%madmanrambler> be aware that he doesn't really combo much except in like 1 or 2 instances, a lot of axl's stuff is spacing and timing more then anything
[0:13:24] <picanoturna> disco
[0:13:28] <%madmanrambler> which can either be frustrating or big
[0:13:38] <+TheFrancix> i hope we get to see the tribunal

[0:14:21] <%Vigonept> disoc elysium: second gig
[0:14:31] <%DatAsuna> play rashidooo
[0:14:51] <+TheFrancix> disco elysium with mirrored stats
[0:15:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OH YEYEYEYEYEY
[0:15:01] <andre11dr> Yeah I think Woolie has the impression that he'll finish this in like 2 sessions, nope
[0:15:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> KENNH OMEGA BABY
[0:15:19] <%madmanrambler> I think he could, but he'd probably have to ditch some minor side quests
[0:15:25] <picanoturna> there is much to be done
[0:15:25] <+TheFrancix> kenny omega yooooo
[0:15:27] <%smyld> I hope V is doing well
[0:15:31] <%Lion_kun> I mean what does he have left?
[0:15:38] <spaceitaly> woolie still has MILES to go
[0:15:43] <%Lion_kun> Finishing the church
[0:15:46] <listopat> more church stuff
[0:15:47] <%hax_metatron> 3 more streams
[0:15:48] <%Lion_kun> The faceoff
[0:15:49] <%livlinn> V turned 30
[0:15:51] <s_unnyd> he must become HARD CORE.
[0:15:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what side stuff is left? from what i remember he has the church, his political quest, and... that's it i think?
[0:15:59] <%Lion_kun> And the finale
[0:16:03] <%madmanrambler> finish the church, finish the ultra liberal quest, a few bits of the cryptid stuff, and then finishing the main quest is all that I'm thinking of
[0:16:06] <andre11dr> There's plenty of stuff
[0:16:11] <dave_guns> there's little quests
[0:16:23] <eccentricpersona> theres A Lot of stuff to do, 50hrs is where i clocked in and boy oh boy did i miss out on a lot
[0:16:29] <andre11dr> he still needs to progress the vision quest
[0:16:33] <%Lion_kun> Is Moralist the best vision quest?
[0:16:34] <picanoturna> it will take a while but yea home stretch soon
[0:16:37] <s_unnyd> Maybe not 2 sessions, but I think he could make it in 3-4.

[0:16:44] <andre11dr> There's the Quno stuff
[0:16:44] <%madmanrambler> I think the communist one is the most hilarious vision quest
[0:16:50] <%madmanrambler> I lost it so hard at that one
[0:16:50] <dave_guns> moralist IS the best VQ
[0:16:56] <andre11dr> The rest of the armour
[0:16:56] <s_unnyd> agreed
[0:16:59] <+airchrysalis> facist is best
[0:17:11] <picanoturna> the moralist quest made me emotional
[0:17:19] <%Lion_kun> Moralist feels the most natural in the story
[0:17:24] <+Roasted_Pheasant> @picanoturna Game is emotional
[0:17:29] <spaceitaly> ultraliberal is easily the weakest, the other three are all excellent and I couldn't pick a favourite
[0:17:33] <%hax_metatron> Moralist VQ has the best story ending IMO
[0:17:37] <%livlinn> grymSoulo grymSoulo grymSoulo
[0:17:39] <%hax_metatron> Like if Disco was a novel that would be the best ending
[0:17:45] <dave_guns> motorics is always getting the shaft
[0:18:08] <s_unnyd> the virgin motorics vs the chad physique
[0:18:09] <dave_guns> if they ever do the cocaine skull DLC they better give it lots of checks
[0:18:10] <picanoturna> @roasted_pheasant there are some moments in the game that i broke down its crazy the writing
[0:18:14] <%madmanrambler> I think the ultraliberal start is fuckin great but all the stuff with the statue and the brand strategist or whatever just did not click
[0:18:20] <andre11dr> The Commie quest is also pretty great
[0:18:50] <dave_guns> they said their next game is gonna have more action stuff at least
[0:18:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:18:54] <s_unnyd> maybe the point of the UL quest is to BE boring?
[0:18:59] <picanoturna> inframaterilism comrade
[0:19:07] <%hax_metatron> I'm 90% sure their next stream game is Dead Space
[0:19:11] <dave_guns> but what could be more exciting than finance
[0:19:25] <s_unnyd> Like all the UL dialogue has all this pizzaz and hustle talk but actual business and economics is kinda tedious
[0:19:26] <%Vigonept> starwars
[0:19:33] <spaceitaly> the ultraliberal quest isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, it just pales in comparison to the other three
[0:19:35] <Blank9> Some day woolie will spread the good word of bionic commando 2009 being a great game
[0:19:38] <%madmanrambler> it would have to be set during a revolution or something right? the next game?
[0:19:41] <+TheFrancix> there is a novel in the universe of disco elysium but it's settled 20 years after disco elysium
[0:19:43] <andre11dr> @dave_guns If you watched the podcast it's pretty obvious what the next game is
[0:19:50] <%madmanrambler> if its in the disco universe
[0:19:57] <%madmanrambler> and wants to be more action packed
[0:20:10] <%Lion_kun> The Moralist quest when you make that call and Harry feels so desperate
[0:20:12] <dave_guns> the disco universe is HUGE
[0:20:17] <dave_guns> There's conflict everywhere
[0:20:19] <%Lion_kun> It makes me so sad.
[0:20:31] <%madmanrambler> just drop us in the semanese isles dealing with asshole corpo mercs
[0:20:33] <s_unnyd> i really hope Sacred and Terrible Air gets an english translation soon
[0:20:37] <picanoturna> @lion_kun yuuup
[0:21:00] <spaceitaly> I think they announced a translation but no news or release date beyond that
[0:21:02] <dave_guns> There's also a lot of weird shit that's not even mentioned in the game, like the floating train station
[0:21:07] <+TheFrancix> super stacked fem woolie makes me uncomfotable
[0:21:08] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[0:21:14] <leith_aziz> Helloo
[0:21:17] <+illusiveSaint> i think I'm the minority who found the moralist one ok, felt like it was convos already had with the idea summarized
[0:21:24] <dave_guns> the translation is stuck
[0:21:25] <s_unnyd> They announced the translation all the way back in 2019
[0:21:34] <s_unnyd> said it would be done in 2020 but here we are
[0:21:45] <dave_guns> the novel's from 2013, Kurvitz has grown a lot from then
[0:21:49] <%hax_metatron> BTW chat This Friday July 30th, 2021, at 6pm GMT+1 / 10am PST ZAUM is getting a new drop of their high quality (but expensive) merch again, including Kim's jacket etc. https://atelier.zaumstudio.com
[0:21:51] <dave_guns> He'd basically rewrite it
[0:22:01] <spaceitaly> it would have been quicker to just learn Estonian by now lol
[0:22:02] <leith_aziz> Tried playing Strive today, sadly my connection was so bad today that everybody one and done-ed me
[0:22:04] <s_unnyd> oh damn for real?
[0:22:15] <mrblitzstream> Ahhhh yessss we are back
[0:22:19] <dave_guns> I hope the translation is illustrated
[0:22:37] <leith_aziz> What is this talk about translation if someone can fill me iin?
[0:22:40] <Davimotion96> SourPls
[0:22:50] <dave_guns> Disco Elysium sequel, it's a book

[0:22:59] <leith_aziz> @dave_guns Hmm, curious
[0:23:00] <%madmanrambler> also came out before disco elysium didn't it?
[0:23:00] <dave_guns> released before the game, set after
[0:23:00] <%hax_metatron> I love that Kim's jacket in the merch above has his stats on the neck tag: +1 H/E Coordination: Airman Kitsuragi +1 Volta do Mar: A feather on the wind

[0:30:54] <leith_aziz> I've seen so many clips of him killing Chipp in like 1 hit
[0:31:01] <andre11dr> But isn't he part of the system ?
[0:31:02] <dds333a> He can zone pretty effectively
[0:31:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @leith_aziz poor fuckin chipp man
[0:31:13] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Listen to his theme
[0:31:21] <dds333a> Maybe mid-range

[1:04:26] <AlphaBankai> Big Bar Thoughts

[1:05:38] <%dukenux> my god...
[1:05:43] <picanoturna> this man SPITTIN
[1:05:45] <DSD24> Oblivion
[1:05:47] <heysamuel> the pale is the coolest concept in modern fiction
[1:05:56] <%madmanrambler> its up there
[1:06:02] <heysamuel> imo, of course
[1:06:07] <%DiscoMatador> Vacuum Decay
[1:06:07] <%X2Eliah> Heat death of the universe YEAAAAH
[1:06:08] <andre11dr> So it Nihilus
[1:06:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> What was, will be. What will be, was.
[1:06:34] <AlphaBankai> This is 10x worse than it was before
[1:06:34] <%madmanrambler> after the world, the pale. after the pale, the world again.
[1:06:35] <+TheFrancix> martinaise is so fucked
[1:06:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Like a Prion
[1:06:43] <primaryfire> martinaise is FUCKED
[1:06:45] <RushUnplugged> @illTemperedSeaBass no that's the Worm
[1:06:46] <objektivespieleanalyse> Ahh my ficticious world threatening slowly progressing phenomenon
[1:06:49] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, that town is fucked
[1:07:00] <spaceitaly> so much more than Martinaise is fucked
[1:07:05] <derap41> LUL bit "literal" with information theory
[1:07:09] <+eanscrale> It'll make a sick night club until then at least.
[1:07:15] <heysamuel> kim i can speak with the city
[1:07:16] <%madmanrambler> it wasn't formed in the church. the church was formed around it.
[1:07:18] <+TheFrancix> probably all jamrock is fucked
[1:07:19] <%madmanrambler> BEST LINE
[1:07:22] <mariothemaio> conspiracy theories :)
[1:07:29] <%xcompleasedad> This is more important than the murder
[1:07:35] <%krispen_wa> reality is fucked
[1:07:39] <heemwizard> @mariothemaio but theres evidence for all of these
[1:07:41] <picanoturna> after beating this game 3 times i still cant tell if this is real or just in harrys head
[1:07:47] <%madmanrambler> its totally real imo
[1:07:52] <AlphaBankai> Harry is super curious of the Pale, because he is a "past" man
[1:07:56] <tequi1asunset> It might be the reason why harry lost his memories, aside from the drinking
[1:08:03] <mariothemaio> @mariothemaio oh sure, i more mean that's how it started for harry
[1:08:04] <KaseKaizer> SCP PogChamp
[1:08:11] <RushUnplugged> now add to this, the fact that the Pale influences people's memory and...
[1:08:12] <%madmanrambler> I would bet on it tbh, the game never confirms it but I think you can draw a line from harry crashing his car to here
[1:08:13] <DSD24> Is this Keter level?
[1:08:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:10:37] <+diobestwaifu> Straight up greatest skill
[1:10:50] <ingman112> Just popping in, but he still needs to check in with Joyce about his gun and Evrart right?
[1:10:50] <AlphaBankai> Best thought is the hardest one to get @madmanrambler The Bow Collector

[1:11:23] <UvBenServed> Thanks Egg Head
[1:11:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OblivionSword1
[1:11:31] <%GHouseduivel> 🥚
[1:11:32] <dave_guns> You know, considering the way this universe works... Harry might be right
[1:11:33] <spaceitaly> only The New can hold off the past
[1:11:34] <+illusiveSaint> culture keeps the world TOGETHER
[1:11:41] <heemwizard> After life, death, after the world, the pale
[1:11:54] <mariothemaio> and after the pale, the world again
[1:11:56] <stardustcrusad3r> wait what
[1:11:59] <dave_guns> oh yeah occasional time travel talk, no big deal
[1:12:03] <marcomatame> @OblivionSword1 sent to the shadow realm
[1:12:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> uhhh
[1:12:07] <Pookiedaexzile> So theres more of these
[1:12:08] <reonome> god fuck the pale
[1:12:08] <iacus_> man, Revachol has it rough. All the socioeconomic collaps, plus a hole of Pale to boot? dang
[1:12:12] <picanoturna> hmmmm
[1:12:15] <OblivionSword1> oops
[1:12:16] <%baka_sugoi> yeah...
[1:12:17] <heemwizard> this shows up in the moralist quest lol
[1:12:18] <%OtakuSnake1> THATS RAD
[1:12:18] <Indigo_Automaton> Ghost Radio
[1:12:18] <+TheFrancix> cleaning out the rooms is the title of song made by british sea power the composers of disco elysium's music
[1:12:18] <SomeAsianDood> ah yes that seems normal
[1:12:19] <Pookiedaexzile> In Revachol
[1:12:20] <JetpackMcQuack> oh god
[1:12:21] <+Archmortal> the pale is a storage unit that can't be decrypted
[1:12:21] <%krispen_wa> @iacus_ potentially 7 HOLES
[1:12:24] <heysamuel> this whole convo is why the moralist quest is my favorite
[1:12:25] <%sahr_zand> "that makes sense"
[1:12:27] <meatman_noplan> Don't like the idea of suddenly catching your long dead mother on the phone.
[1:12:27] <+illusiveSaint> the past gets traveled thru the radio literally
[1:12:28] <AlphaBankai> @iacus_ "a hole"? There's seven
[1:12:29] <Davimotion96> No wonder RCM officers tend to be fucked up
[1:12:30] <picanoturna> ::::makes you think::::::
[1:12:30] <dave_guns> Soona is cute
[1:12:30] <stardustcrusad3r> is this about the voice in the doorbell
[1:12:33] <mariothemaio> Moralist quest is the best for overall worldbuilding lore
[1:12:35] <taeko_ohnuki> so that shivers was...
[1:12:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @stardustcrusad3r yea
[1:12:39] <%dukenux> Harry just secured himself whatever would be this worlds version of Noble Prize in physics
[1:12:42] <iacus_> yeah, potentially seven. even worse lol
[1:12:49] <dave_guns> Completely human related too, a cosmic event made for humans only
[1:12:49] <+TheFrancix> talk to egg head
[1:12:53] <ingman112> @woolieversus Joyce should have some new dialogue as well, under some of the older options
[1:12:57] <+LandOfTheWay> great thought
[1:13:00] <+diobestwaifu> Best skill in the game
[1:13:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wait aren’t the other 6 churches all destroyed?
[1:13:06] <marcomatame> The pale is everything that has ever happened all at once
[1:13:11] <%krispen_wa> Cleaning out the Rooms is a British Sea Power song
[1:13:12] <Pookiedaexzile> The city has holes in reality all over it
[1:13:17] <spaceitaly> "seven"? are you guys forgetting what exists between the isolas?
[1:13:18] <guiltyboya> where the hood, where the hood, where the hood's at?
[1:13:19] <available_line> It's like all information in the universe stored inside the event horizon of a black hole.
[1:13:22] <chainsaw105> I like the idea that the Pale forms in the ruins of the OLD ideals, while it is the new, in this case the anodic dance club, that suppresses it
[1:13:30] <andre11dr> So this a great thought
[1:13:30] <meatman_noplan> Its rarefied past.
[1:13:30] <mariothemaio> get rid of DOB generator
[1:13:31] <skyenoz> @suckerpunchsyd yep, so no more containment for them...
[1:13:31] <heemwizard> its a good one
[1:13:33] <+illusiveSaint> replace superstar
[1:13:37] <SomeAsianDood> @spaceitaly they're talking about holes
[1:13:42] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @skyenoz NotLikeThis ohhhh boy
[1:13:43] <Visorak6> DOB
[1:13:48] <andre11dr> Yeah replace superstar
[1:13:53] <buffcat> jamais vu isnt that useful anymore
[1:13:55] <LegitBarnacleBoy> pepeD
[1:13:56] <Indigo_Automaton> Superstar can go
[1:13:59] <heemwizard> replalce dob?
[1:14:01] <spaceitaly> @chainsaw105 the pale is mark fisher's concept of hauntology made manifest
[1:14:01] <AlphaBankai> In a new life. By the SEa Side. You Wake Up
[1:14:05] <dave_guns> yeah you're never very superstar anymore
[1:14:08] <SomeAsianDood> jamais vu always useful
[1:14:08] <Indigo_Automaton> Oh that's good to get rid of too
[1:14:08] <WeepyDevil> no that ones great
[1:14:12] <%dukenux> Wouldn't Joyce and Evrart like to hear that the city is oa
[1:14:20] <WeepyDevil> some kind of superstar is pretty worthless
[1:14:21] <DSD24> No now you forgot your age again
[1:14:24] <WeepyDevil> oh well
[1:14:24] <%Jeshk0> who needs to remember their bday anyway?
[1:14:25] <+mechslayer71> date of birth generator was really good but okay
[1:14:26] <%dukenux> *is pale-posituve
[1:14:27] <WeepyDevil> too late lol
[1:14:33] <AlphaBankai> Woolie is so quiet, is everything okay?
[1:14:38] <heemwizard> @dukenux i'd doubt evart would believe that
[1:14:42] <dave_guns> lore is good
[1:14:44] <iacus_> not all thoughts are equally useful for sure
[1:14:48] <andre11dr> I guess you forgot how old you are again
[1:14:56] <%baka_sugoi> very
[1:15:03] <%krispen_wa> YEEEEEAAAH
[1:15:10] <WeepyDevil> what hair?

[1:15:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> time to scum it up
[1:15:51] <%kewlmyc> I'd honestly scum it up
[1:15:51] <dave_guns> gonna have to make yourself a techhead
[1:15:53] <%krispen_wa> OOF
[1:15:54] <SomeAsianDood> save scum if need be
[1:15:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> remove the dang tool
[1:15:57] <burundi_cloud> oh no
[1:15:58] <%dukenux> ohai Andre
[1:15:59] <+TheFrancix> you have to scum i guess
[1:16:00] <andre11dr> So in this universe Harry invented Industrial LUL
[1:16:01] <%baka_sugoi> YO YOU GOTTA DANCE
[1:16:05] <%sahr_zand> 97 xp points though
[1:16:08] <+mechslayer71> the interfacing check unlocks the other check I believe
[1:16:09] <spaceitaly> use the pale to turn the compressor into a grimy genesis soundchip
[1:16:13] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> dance dance dance!!
[1:16:17] <+HeroSolaire> Did Woolie get the moralist quest chat?
[1:16:19] <WeepyDevil> you don't have anything else for itnerfacing
[1:16:21] <derap41> prettt sure its just the gloes
[1:16:23] <WeepyDevil> its just glvoes
[1:16:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think it's just the gloves
[1:16:27] <Davimotion96> If you wanna dance, you need Authority
[1:16:28] <SomeAsianDood> @herosolaire liberal
[1:16:30] <meatman_noplan> @HeroSolaire no, ultra lib.
[1:16:33] <+mechslayer71> @herosolaire ulrtabliberal
[1:16:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @HeroSolaire he's on that grind, ultra lib
[1:16:33] <dave_guns> it's a rare skill
[1:16:34] <AlphaBankai> Its fun how this game saves the BEST failure-rewards for the beggining, when you have lower stats and lower boosters from other explorations, conversations and thoughts
[1:16:34] <WeepyDevil> gotta put points in
[1:16:37] <andre11dr> You can just save scum this one
[1:16:42] <+illusiveSaint> you need to level it up anyway to try again
[1:16:42] <derap41> ...Woolie
[1:16:45] <Johannen> For the Composure check you will also need a little bit of authority, trust on this one
[1:16:46] <+TheFrancix> nooooo

[1:51:44] <meatman_noplan> You start out getting some would-be speed dealers off an ice floe and end up having a religious experience, speaking with the soul of the city. 10/10

[1:52:44] <taeko_ohnuki> Ahhh, good times
[1:52:45] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Failing Kim's check is really, really bad
[1:52:48] <crunchington001> Can you imagine playing through this game and not doing this sidequest?
[1:52:48] <derap41> I need a cigarette after this
[1:52:48] <%livlinn> spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance spaceyeenSmuggydance
[1:52:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @notadeasterisk Every time you talk to someone in this game you're missing hidden checks
[1:52:54] <mrblitzstream> Got the Blood Pumpin
[1:52:55] <dreamfillah> BEST SIDEQUEST
[1:52:56] <DelgotHansto> @buffcat saw that on the wiki and was instantly drawn to it, good to know where it comes from, hypest quote in the game
[1:52:57] <+PkSilent01> Did they get racist during that lart
[1:53:00] <+PkSilent01> Part
[1:53:00] <mr_magnificent_305> You get a really big revelation if you pass Godly reaction speed check
[1:53:01] <dave_guns> if they filled the church with people doing hardcore, it might slow down the hole
[1:53:05] <meatman_noplan> Good to meet you, miss
[1:53:06] <+mczarklesby> Congratulations!
[1:53:07] <mrblitzstream> EVERYBODY GOT MOTIVATED
[1:53:08] <+LandOfTheWay> this game is godlike
[1:53:09] <dewwy125> @crunchington001 my game glitched when the church started shaking and i couldnt complete it :(
[1:53:13] <%hax_metatron> Now we just barrel to the end of the game
[1:53:13] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus You desperately need to see the fail version of inviting Kim to dance
[1:53:20] <marcomatame> We transcended the physical realm and entered the realm of the Gods through auditive air fluctuations and bodily contortions.
[1:53:27] <%Gruhunchously> Goddamn Shivers
[1:53:30] <andre11dr> I like how she likes you because you literally represent the city as a cop
[1:53:31] <dave_guns> oh yeah, the murder
[1:53:31] <derap41> Inland crying in the corner saying he's got a bad feeling
[1:53:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> Why does he need to see it?
[1:53:32] <chainsaw105> Queen Shivers technically
[1:53:40] <spaceitaly> back to reality
[1:53:42] <AlphaBankai> Game over huh, what even quest is there to complete anymore, game is done after that
[1:53:42] <meatman_noplan> Junkyard Dog
[1:53:43] <+Bobbledygook> No more stream needed, we’re done here, what more do we need
[1:53:58] <+fetrigon> wtf is this Q outfit? LUL
[1:54:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think theres a murder or something
[1:54:00] <%hax_metatron> Exactly, this is the game for me. There's one more scene I want Woolie to see, but this is a GOAT LP already
[1:54:01] <%Gruhunchously> We did what needed to be done
[1:54:04] <%krispen_wa> i guess theres the investigation sidequest to finish. but what a main quest though
[1:54:08] <SomeAsianDood> we still need to meet the other girls though chat
[1:54:12] <+Bobbledygook> Now to finish the side quests
[1:54:15] <andre11dr> He still has to find the last armour piece huh
[1:54:19] <Trace_Bovier> ok what the heck were we supposed to actually be doing. something about a murder or something?
[1:54:20] <TheMagneticDragon> Whatabout good old necktie, you need the disgusting necktie, don't betray your friend bratan
[1:54:23] <primaryfire> phys instrument will be all good in a couple hours
[1:54:27] <%Gruhunchously> "Pretty good" Kappa
[1:54:29] <skyenoz> it's INTERESTING
[1:54:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Not good.
[1:54:29] <derap41> failing is almost as good as winnign
[1:54:29] <AlphaBankai> Tiago is imbibing
[1:54:31] <LegitBarnacleBoy> he's imbibing
[1:54:36] <Tiittamari> tiago's chilling
[1:54:37] <%hax_metatron> Tiago is on a different level
[1:54:40] <Fabpsi_> Crabman is dancing in the void
[1:54:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> They exist, they are fascinating, they are not good
[1:54:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Busy bein a crab man
[1:54:44] <WeepyDevil> tiago's high on the end of the universe
[1:54:44] <%baka_sugoi> taigo saw
[1:54:45] <Demoli_PT> the fail state on the authority check with kim is NOT good
[1:54:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tiago probably can't hear anything up there
[1:54:49] <derap41> pretty sure he's humping a hole into a beam up there
[1:54:50] <primaryfire> maybe he just always feels it
[1:54:57] <%dukenux> but this was perfect
[1:55:00] <Ids560> I think the shivers failure is alright but the authority failure is real bad
[1:55:01] <linSP> do NOT fail with Kim
[1:55:01] <taeko_ohnuki> Tiago is checked out
[1:55:02] <zanzibarian_hamster> oh please no

[1:55:24] <RaiNiMayonnaise> Unnecessary tbh
[1:55:27] <%LCLSmoothie> nah nah nah it’s fine
[1:55:29] <dave_guns> don't worry about it, just keep moving forward
[1:55:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> your stats are so good it's probably actually harder to fail
[1:55:40] <dave_guns> You invented the future of dance and saved Revachol
[1:55:45] <heemwizard> talk to Joyce
[1:55:49] <dave_guns> that's a nice point to move on

[2:12:14] <andre11dr> This is what happens when a novelist writes your game
[2:12:14] <+Archmortal> an amnesiac re-learning the history of the world
[2:12:16] <+jhuzar91> exposition done right
[2:12:17] <primaryfire> the writing is so vivid and imaginative that it paints a picture so easily that you forget you're not having stuff shown

[2:22:02] <%BernieSandworm> it does feel bad to lose 92%
[2:22:03] <stardustcrusad3r> This convo fucks you with no warning
[2:22:05] <Fabpsi_> inb4 another 92% fail
[2:22:05] <notadeasterisk> it happens
[2:22:05] <%Gruhunchously> SCHUM
[2:22:10] <+lordericter> wowwwww
[2:22:11] <%BernieSandworm> even if it happens 8% of the time
[2:22:13] <iacus_> i'm ok with scumming sometimes but come onnnn
[2:22:15] <iacus_> just roll with it
[2:22:17] <notadeasterisk> you're insane
[2:22:18] <linSP> one more ☝️
[2:22:18] <%hax_metatron> Pick up book
[2:22:21] <guiltyboya> Not or honor, but for SCUM
[2:22:21] <%xxMylord> It's Karma for savescúmming
[2:22:23] <codymagpie> 92% fail does hurt a little :)
[2:22:24] <mrblitzstream> 92% i feel ROBBED
[2:22:25] <%hax_metatron> Children's Book
[2:22:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Come on dungeonmaster, fudge the roll
[2:22:27] <+lordericter> scumming
[2:22:28] <quesokano> No one is as insane as you, detective!
[2:22:30] <skyenoz> honestly yeah, I'm all for this
[2:22:31] <%X2Eliah> Image if outcomes of all dice rolls were pre-seeded on game start, and re-rolling was not possible
[2:22:31] <spaceitaly> well, at least now I can get up for a drink lol
[2:22:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Evrart wins
[2:22:37] <BurnySpirit> honestly cool with scumming if the fail isn't actually very entertaining
[2:22:41] <iacus_> not quite human xD
[2:22:46] <+Jeshk0> tell her to return to her swamp this time
[2:22:55] <%baka_sugoi> woolieLORE
[2:22:56] <guiltyboya> @X2Eliah shhh, don't give them ideas
[2:23:01] <chainsaw105> seeing all this extra Joyce/Evrart stuff makes me kinda sad I didn't do ANY of Evrart's quests on my first playthrough
[2:23:02] <andre11dr> Also, it was a 92 ,it was kinda bullshit
[2:23:22] <AlphaBankai> Using the wind
[2:23:29] <AlphaBankai> Basically using wind curents
[2:23:31] <Pookiedaexzile> He....just said that
[2:23:37] <primaryfire> using natural ocean currents
[2:23:40] <%BernieSandworm> so you psychologically steer into the wind?
[2:23:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> It involved circular wind currents that took you away initially but then right back to port
[2:23:44] <skyenoz> So taking the long way is actually the fastest... Kinda like what Kims doing with following you and doing side quests
[2:23:44] <iacus_> man I wish ppl stopped with that. It's just maths. 8% chance of failure. Bad luck, that's it
[2:23:45] <elshadow7> Get a point of rhetoric in there for good measure
[2:23:51] <notadeasterisk> go forward to the sea to return home
[2:23:54] <derap41> We've got bands of wind currents
[2:23:59] <Deasmeister> Steering away from home to get home if you want to be poetic
[2:24:12] <AlphaBankai> Basically: go into the pale to discover the world
[2:24:27] <AlphaBankai> Get far from yourself to return to your self
[2:24:30] <skyenoz> It MIGHT seem useless and unimportant but it's the fastest way to solve the case
[2:24:33] <linSP> Shivers take the wheel
[2:24:35] <derap41> Also why it was so hard to reach America
[2:24:40] <IrishHashbrown> Going with the flow
[2:24:46] <quesokano> @skyenoz See, this guy knows what's up
[2:24:54] <+illusiveSaint> it's a skill when you're navigating or for metrology

[2:25:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> I'm on board the scumming in this scenario.
[2:25:17] <iacus_> fair enough... it's a long convo though
[2:25:25] <Fabpsi_> Mr. Evrart helped me find my gun.
[2:25:25] <Ids560> honestly if you're not gonna play the game again I say scum as much as you want

[2:27:59] <JetpackMcQuack> we,, it was gary
[2:28:00] <derap41> Kim really just going Wtf are you telling her for
[2:28:13] <heemwizard> @derap41 talking to her feels nice
[2:28:13] <iacus_> technically, it DIDN'T have to be done, but yeah...
[2:28:19] <Johannen> Woolie is so compromised he is willing to spill all the beans
[2:28:29] <BurdRightsActivist> Woolie comprimised.
[2:28:39] <derap41> @derap41 Just can't help opening up telling her everything
[2:28:39] <iacus_> Listen to Kim!
[2:28:44] <%Jeshk0> so compromised

[2:29:00] <dave_guns> that IS true

[2:29:25] <skyenoz> isn't 2 something everyone knows already?
[2:29:27] <%krispen_wa> without volition, woolie cant deal with manipulation
[2:29:54] <derap41> Woolie she is an Ultra Liberal
[2:29:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What is her best?
[2:30:03] <derap41> She will do what is best for her
[2:30:04] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What does best look like for her?
[2:30:11] <shincadad> She has power
[2:30:12] <iacus_> depends on what advice you give her
[2:30:18] <dave_guns> she's an ultraliberal, but she likes Revachol
[2:30:25] <vasily_kardanov> actually I don't think the advice matters at all
[2:30:43] <Fabpsi_> she is "insane", and knows knowledge is power
[2:30:45] <Blank9> evrart is a great person
[2:30:45] <derap41> You're talking to a lizard person with no empathy and only transactional thoughts
[2:30:47] <heemwizard> good observation
[2:30:49] <gyrobasel> how close is he to finishing the game?
[2:30:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah they def have their own motives that have nothing to do with you
[2:31:01] <Johannen> @gyrobasel 80%
[2:31:01] <iacus_> they are both looking for their interests. Joyce is a capitalist rep, Evrart is a corrupt socialist
[2:31:02] <shoonet> joyce is likable and evil. evrart is insufferable and good
[2:31:03] <%Jeshk0> 70-80%
[2:31:04] <mariothemaio> @gyrobasel very close.

[2:31:26] <BurnySpirit> it's honestly kinda debatable if we ever see what Evrart is really like
[2:31:27] <%ppangboi> calling Evrart good is a bit of a stretch considering his willingness to spill so much blood
[2:31:35] <heemwizard> @gyrobasel might finish it within the week
[2:31:37] <mariothemaio> OUR cinderblock town Joyce
[2:31:39] <BurnySpirit> his greasiness might just be an act for the detective its hard to tell
[2:31:39] <TheMagneticDragon> I prefer insufferable and good over likeable and evil tho

[2:32:19] <iacus_> it seems pretty easy to tell imo. He even admits to teh drug operation

[2:48:13] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There is a very clear point of no return prompt.
[2:48:24] <%Jeshk0> oh no, that "HO!" sets off the missile strikes! game over man!
[2:48:29] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[2:48:35] <BurnySpirit> btw it's kind ambigous if like inland is supernatural but are we all just accepting that Shivers is an actual superpower
[2:48:47] <BurnySpirit> because damn
[2:48:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> EDC is a superpower too
[2:49:00] <%dukenux> man, after this quest and that talk everything will feel underwhelming
[2:49:14] <AlphaBankai> @BurnySpirit Inland Empire is your personal ghosts, Shivers are the city's
[2:49:25] <dewwy125> apocalypse cop harry is pretty much Cassandra imo
[2:49:28] <iacus_> getting pretty late at night
[2:49:30] <mariothemaio> Inland-Shivers best combo
[2:49:32] <SomeAsianDood> brain damaged induced superpowers. basically hdb is kick ass
[2:49:32] <AlphaBankai> @dukenux some momments coming up are really good
[2:49:36] <dextralmalin> bedtime?
[2:49:48] <%Vigonept> Fuck you kim, i wanna be a cryptid hunter

[2:50:18] <%Jeshk0> i dont feel hopeful about IDS making progress on that statue....
[2:50:24] <iacus_> why would you play a boardgame now? It's already bedtime
[2:50:24] <notadeasterisk> sometimes
[2:50:27] <+OuchPotatoEX> sometimes you do
[2:50:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> some of them yes
[2:50:30] <Johannen> Boardgame? Does he mean the Tabletop RPG?
[2:50:32] <derap41> You have an unread book
[2:50:40] <%Vigonept> learn your ABC's
[2:50:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like the communist mag, kim chimes in on tip top
[2:50:47] <heemwizard> you already saw it?
[2:50:54] <heemwizard> gotta wait for a bit
[2:51:03] <illTemperedSeaBass> Ya'know, going back to how Kim, and presumably everyone else, have their own stats in their heads, I wonder what Kim's in particular say about Harry's antics. Does his own empathy ever be like "yeah, he's about to go full well-intentioned idiot again."
[2:51:04] <+mechslayer71> @alphabankai espirit I meant
[2:51:04] <Eger007> ыдууз
[2:51:11] <linSP> You down for a 3am DnD sesh?
[2:51:15] <%Gruhunchously> IS there something they want to do tonight? Because they can just go to be otherwise
[2:51:17] <Eger007> sleep
[2:51:19] <OblivionSword1> try again tomorrow maybe
[2:51:33] <mariothemaio> i dont think time passes after 2am so you wont progress on thoughts anymore
[2:51:35] <BurnySpirit> yknow Kim's authority is prob the one that speaks up the most
[2:51:38] <dextralmalin> oh yay, they got the fedora
[2:51:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Read books with kim?
[2:51:45] <%Gruhunchously> KappaPride
[2:51:47] <%livlinn> PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise
[2:51:49] <heysamuel> you Connected
[2:51:51] <iacus_> on the church case
[2:51:52] <Fabpsi_> OH, the murder!
[2:51:57] <Fabpsi_> i forgot about it
[2:51:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Kim comments on books, sometimes
[2:51:59] <%dukenux> but on the IMPORTANT stuff
[2:52:00] <mariothemaio> what if the murder case was the friends we made along the way :)
[2:52:05] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Yo your ass can afford to pony up $20
[2:52:07] <+Itzdatguy73> Reading with Kim gets extra dialogue
[2:52:14] <SomeAsianDood> @illtemperedseabass according to the merch kims jacket gives him +1 Volta da Mar literally allowing him to go with the flow of Harry's bs
[2:52:16] <AlphaBankai> @mariothemaio this but unironically
[2:52:16] <%Jeshk0> its not a shack, kim, its a HOME
[2:52:17] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah we started out investigating a murder and ended up dancing so hard the city spoke to us
[2:52:36] <DSD24> Dick Mullen is a good book
[2:52:37] <derap41> What do you need to learn before reading=
[2:52:37] <%Jeshk0> yeah Dick Mullen!
[2:52:38] <dave_guns> did Woolie pay for the damages to his room?
[2:52:47] <%Burningfajitas> @dave_guns he did
[2:52:48] <BurnySpirit> the murder investigation is a mislead, the true videogame is talking to strangers until you make them uncomfortable
[2:52:49] <+Sir_Louis> Kim has good comments for the kid book iirc
[2:52:51] <dave_guns> oh nice

[2:58:45] <derap41> Harry thought he might have Murdered the Merc
[2:58:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Johannen A major voice in the US civil rights movement

[2:59:44] <linSP> hello euros

[2:59:46] <+lordericter> uh oh
[2:59:46] <%Juriasu> he's not as covered in europe
[2:59:47] <naoi0> What
[2:59:47] <+whiskywolfe> Malcolm X founded the X-Men.
[2:59:48] <+Jakeofalco> not america
[2:59:49] <+MrATheGreat> WHAT
[2:59:50] <%dukenux> Someone's dad didn't make him read Malcolm X at 10 Kappa
[2:59:50] <Fabpsi_> worth reading, try to check it out!
[2:59:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> I learned about him from the fresh prince tbh
[2:59:56] <BurnySpirit> honestly I had to find out about him on my own, never came up in school
[2:59:58] <+airchrysalis> he runs a school for mutants
[3:00:01] <BurnySpirit> which seems like a big oversight
[3:00:01] <%Vigonept> malcom x is malcom in the middles brother
[3:00:02] <+fetrigon> @whiskywolfe this SeemsGood
[3:00:04] <bebopdedop281> Megaman spin off
[3:00:07] <%DukeBlack_> Malcom x found genosia
[3:00:08] <+MrATheGreat> Malcom X is also known as Magneto he’s very cool.
[3:00:09] <available_line> That's pretty much it.
[3:00:09] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yeah that's a good metaphor
[3:00:11] <%Jeshk0> LUL OMG LUL
[3:00:12] <mariothemaio> @whiskywolfe my favorite x-men LUL
[3:00:13] <%sahr_zand> C I A

[3:00:18] <%livlinn> Nice
[3:00:25] <+illusiveSaint> LUL very nice take knxPWR
[3:00:25] <+OuchPotatoEX> oh how tables have turned
[3:00:26] <sporeian94> COI killed him
[3:00:26] <derap41> Woolie knows how to reach
[3:00:28] <Chatterbox1991> He was assassinated for backing down from his militant ideology by hardliners he used to roll with
[3:00:31] <Johannen> Ok, got it, i know Luther King somewhat, Malcolm X is new to me
[3:00:33] <mariothemaio> and like magneto he was right
[3:00:33] <available_line> Darth MLK
[3:00:38] <andre11dr> I'm Eastern European and yea i had to learn about most black history on my own
[3:00:40] <Chatterbox1991> to my knowledge*
[3:00:40] <%Lion_kun> It's also a very long Denzel movie
[3:00:40] <skyenoz> Yeah I only learned about him like a year ago
[3:00:40] <+TheFrancix> MALCOM X MEN
[3:00:47] <%Burningfajitas> There's stuff pointing to Malcolm X was assassinated by the FBI
[3:00:49] <+Fedhas> go to youtube and look up some of his speeches
[3:00:55] <Tiittamari> yeah this aint taught here in europe, will go look now though
[3:00:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:00:59] <naoi0> Race allegory my mutant fiction
[3:01:04] <mariothemaio> FBI took down both X and MLK ;)
[3:01:06] <+airchrysalis> one night in miami has a good portrayal of malcolm x
[3:01:07] <+lordericter> and while its alleged that MLK got killed by the FBI we KNOW the FBI killed Maclom X
[3:01:08] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I mean, the FBI murdered MLK. I wouldn't put it past them
[3:01:14] <%Irridium> I mean MLK was killed by the government so that'd make sense
[3:01:17] <+whiskywolfe> @andre11dr I’m Western European and yeah, same.
[3:01:21] <+illusiveSaint> it's a Spike Lee joint
[3:01:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> I mean I didn't take history in my country (the uk) and the extent of black history I was taught was just slavery stuff
[3:01:27] <%Afterman_> oof tulsa
[3:01:27] <meatman_noplan> Tulsa is the real shit.
[3:01:31] <Johannen> I only know Tulsa from Watchmen
[3:01:34] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Both were murdered by the government though specifics i dont remember
[3:01:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Johannen Honestly he gets kinda glossed over in the US too because of the militarism
[3:01:35] <Dopamien> WutFace
[3:01:37] <derap41> What do you know of Social revolutionaries
[3:01:38] <andre11dr> See i know about Tulsa because of Woolie
[3:01:38] <%DkLordG> Anybody else check out One Night In Miami?
[3:01:43] <mariothemaio> man it's wild how so many people (myself included) learned about Tulsa from the fuckin Watchmen HBO show
[3:01:44] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oof Tulsa hurts
[3:01:44] <SomeAsianDood> Tulsa is super hard for even Americans it's insane
[3:01:46] <%Irridium> well yeah that would make white people feel bad
[3:01:48] <+rairaku> Not that he was more "militant" he was more about "yo instead of integrating we should bring ourselves up and make ourselves more desirable as a people. Cause we need to be as equal as the white man
[3:01:51] <naoi0> The black panthers’ debut was running away from the cops
[3:01:52] <coreybom> Oh shit we got some conspiracy brothers in the chat huh?
[3:01:52] <%debrv> @andre11dr Saaame.
[3:01:52] <sushahana> nikola tesla?
[3:01:55] <Ids560> learning about Japanese internment at like 18 was weird
[3:01:56] <%livlinn> yea I can bet Asian folks aren't even familiar with this history
[3:01:56] <derap41> The Souths educational system is fucked
[3:02:02] <+Jakeofalco> historic to you
[3:02:04] <%Lion_kun> I'm central European and I know who Marholm X is and watched the movie and the Ali movie with will smith.
[3:02:06] <%Arnoldoaad1> No Joke I did learn of Tulsa from Watchmen, I am from Latin america but still
[3:02:10] <+MrATheGreat> I hadn’t heard of Tulsa and I’m from the southern side of the US. We’re fucked down here.
[3:02:15] <%GHouseduivel> Some parts of the US teach the Civil War as a war of rights and not slavery
[3:02:15] <BurnySpirit> my experience of learning civil rights stuff in the UK was ''racisms bad, US did a racism then MLK did the civil rights movement''
[3:02:16] <derap41> Post war Widows in the south bunch of Karens
[3:02:18] <mariothemaio> Tulsa really just got buried
[3:02:19] <dewwy125> also check out the black panthers
[3:02:19] <+illusiveSaint> a lot of it is learned a lot later in college too which limits the exposure
[3:02:21] <BurnySpirit> like, hilariously barebones
[3:02:23] <%illtima> I don't think American civil history was ever even mentioned back in my highschool in Kazakhstan
[3:02:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Did Woolie ever see the Watchman series? I remember he talked about it on the sponsored stream
[3:02:30] <%Lion_kun> I didn't know about Black Wall Street till Watchmen
[3:02:31] <andre11dr> I did find of Mary Turner on my own ,offfff that one is rough
[3:02:31] <%Vigonept> it varies per state
[3:02:34] <Chatterbox1991> Tulsa Race Riots/Black Wallstreet
[3:02:35] <%dukenux> i have a very basic knowledge of american civil rights history, but i did read on Tulsa before Watchmen
[3:02:35] <buffcat> Its getting worse now with the CRT panic shit
[3:02:38] <RamenRiderZ> What do you mean you don't know Aimo Koivunen Woolie?
[3:02:38] <illTemperedSeaBass> @derap41 Don't pretend for a moment that's a problem unique to the south. The US in general has an unimaginably fucked education system.
[3:02:38] <JetpackMcQuack> We don't teach that :)
[3:02:39] <%Vigonept> i learned about all that shit in arkansas
[3:02:43] <Quigsies> My history teacher insisted the civil war wasn’t about slavery
[3:02:44] <+illusiveSaint> dsaWest dsaWest dsaWest dsaWest
[3:02:45] <heemwizard> @illtima what history did you learn in kazakhstan?
[3:02:47] <derap41> The "state Rights" myth
[3:02:48] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @ghouseduivel I’ve seen people try to teach it as a war of economics 🙄
[3:02:48] <%Irridium> I got to learn about Tuskagee on my own that was a fun time
[3:02:51] <%Vigonept> ableit... in bits then did my own research
[3:02:54] <Fuji808> Tulsa was not a riot. Tulsa was a massacre.
[3:03:02] <%dukenux> ^
[3:03:05] <%debrv> Fuck my Dad told me about Tulsa Massacre....
[3:03:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus most of the US South has horrible, anti-history history books basically.
[3:03:11] <Johannen> Yeah, we had our own slavery and invaders...so america's history might not be as important
[3:03:11] <Chatterbox1991> shit sorry
[3:03:14] <Karhax> What does Woolie know about Olof Palme?
[3:03:17] <linSP> there’s a lot of “oh yea btw” like the us having their own camps for the japanese during ww2
[3:03:18] <iacus_> !uptime
[3:03:18] <@Moobot> @iacus_ WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 3 minutes
[3:03:19] <%dukenux> "Pogrom" fits what happened in Tulsa really well
[3:03:29] <coreybom> In fairness Tulsa was fucking BURIED in history. Unless you were black with parents willing to teach you, You wouldn’t have known about until the internet.
[3:03:29] <naoi0> Woolie versus history
[3:03:29] <mariothemaio> man so wild how young the internet is to me as a late-20s
[3:03:37] <%illtima> @illtima Mostly our own history + lots of Russia and USSR countries. Almost minimal coverage of US
[3:03:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok i just learned about tulsa and... wtf
[3:03:40] <+Archmortal> the US government worked very hard and still works very hard to suppress this kind of education
[3:03:48] <+illusiveSaint> they assume kids are not "ready" to learn it until college
[3:03:57] <%townzzzzz> majinoDrank
[3:04:01] <fitlog84> Its American history they dont teach it here especially in Oklahoma till now
[3:04:02] <%Irridium> The first black person to attend a school with white people is still alive. She has an instagram account.
[3:04:03] <%livlinn> shiaCry
[3:04:07] <andre11dr> Dude they aren't teaching black history in European schools, especially American history
[3:04:08] <+MrATheGreat> People can martyr MLK and demonize Malcolm X so it’s fine to teach, Tulsa has no lesson except white people are/can be monsters so it’s ‘too evil’.
[3:04:11] <%dukenux> man, but then kids learn about history, and they start doing Holocaust reaction tik toks .. you cant win
[3:04:12] <dave_guns> spillane is a noir author too
[3:04:13] <%Jeshk0> i mean, emmett till would be 80 today...
[3:04:18] <%DukeBlack_> Jessica smollet?!
[3:04:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Even still its not super taught in college unless you actively look for it
[3:04:21] <mariothemaio> @illusiveSaint remember, you can't drink until 21 but you can go to war to shoot a gun at 18 :) Murrika
[3:04:28] <dave_guns> that's not how it works, Mullen
[3:04:30] <SomeAsianDood> yes but we can't have our kids learn about critical race theory. amirite?
[3:04:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> @andre11dr They don't really teach it in American schools either
[3:04:34] <heemwizard> @illtima pretty interesting, do you still live in kazakhstan?
[3:04:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @jeshk0 pain.
[3:04:39] <derap41> oh no
[3:04:43] <coreybom> @archmortal More of the Right by this point. They think that shit anything that calls out racism is “bad for america”.
[3:04:46] <AlphaBankai> Not enough Espirit to chime in on all the COP BULLSHIT this book is saying. THREE FREE DAYS OFF COURT??
[3:04:51] <%illtima> @illtima Nah. Living in Canada now
[3:04:53] <RamenRiderZ> Learn history so you can clap when you see it
[3:04:57] <Johannen> Malcolm X was not mentioned in the "history of the entire world i guess" so whatever Kappa
[3:05:16] <BurnySpirit> If you ask the judge very nicely they let you go home and play videogames instead of doing jail
[3:05:19] <andre11dr> I'm still lost
[3:05:20] <Blackleafx> mau mau uprising was horrific
[3:05:25] <AnneSQF> Mau Mau! My favorite anime
[3:05:25] <Blackleafx> in the way the British dealt with it
[3:05:27] <mariothemaio> @AlphaBankai I wish they had a higher EDC, there's so much you can miss about the RCM lore without it. I upped it on my second run and it really was Blue Shivers
[3:05:46] <+illusiveSaint> or the education is anti american, look up the new made up CRT dialogue they're upset it's about history
[3:05:47] <mariothemaio> But this game is amazing for replay
[3:05:47] <%dukenux> or Prussians in Namibia
[3:06:03] <AlphaBankai> Its impressive how much education on racial stuff I got living in Brazil, which was also as colonized as America, but ALSO got through a military dictatorship, we still learn how stuff sucked
[3:06:04] <%Vigonept> i wonder how many people know about the salvadorian civil war

Ruby Bridges, the first black person to attend a white school, is 66 and has an instagram account. Rosa Parks died 4 years after the first Shrek movie. This stuff isn't that long ago.

[4:19:06] <OblivionSword1> TRUE EVRART
[4:19:07] <notadeasterisk> a mistake evrat is free
[4:19:09] <linSP> evrart did nothing wrong
[4:19:11] <BurnySpirit> you thought it was chess but it's yugioh
[4:19:23] <derap41> Evrart knows
[4:19:24] <+MrATheGreat> Did Woolie just get fucked?
[4:19:26] <mariothemaio> evrart did 5d chess
[4:19:30] <%Blackleafx> Evrart is based
[4:19:34] <%Blackleafx> he's on that sigma grind
[4:19:37] <%madmanrambler> Woolie did blow him out a little bad with the faked letter
[4:19:44] <%madmanrambler> but yeah Evrart's been playing a strong game here
[4:19:45] <%meatman_noplan> Evrart's goals are good tho
[4:19:48] <Johannen> SomeBoody getting Punnkeed...Punked punked
[4:19:51] <romc215> The Po-lice, the Po po, the fuzz, the heat
[4:20:04] <BurnySpirit> I'd say the faked letter bought the fishing village like...a month
[4:20:05] <derap41> Didn't hear you say that Woolie
[4:20:06] <+lordericter> time for the mask to come down on the jolly communist
[4:20:09] <BurnySpirit> and thats prob a generous guess
[4:20:11] <iacus_> checkers
[4:20:18] <mariothemaio> LUL
[4:20:18] <%Blackleafx> Tbh you know he was playing you but not for what end
[4:20:24] <heemwizard> chess? no i prefer go
[4:20:37] <linSP> 1D chess
[4:20:46] <derap41> ...horror stories
[4:20:55] <BurnySpirit> as much as he is slime Evrart is kind of amazing at speed tactics
[4:21:05] <%yusefHD> We'll do it live, fuck it.
[4:21:16] <Martianorbit> What did Woolie advise her to do?
[4:21:16] <%Blackleafx> Mah bois
[4:21:19] <BurnySpirit> turned a hanging that got dropped on his lap out of nowhere into a way to get everything he wants
[4:21:25] <derap41> Didn't even realize they had cameras

[4:22:14] <mariothemaio> you thought you were playing the game but the game played you

[4:22:33] <%Gruhunchously> Based
[4:22:35] <%madmanrambler> can't imagine the sneaky squad is more then 4-6 people though
[4:22:45] <dewwy125> evrart "based" claire
[4:22:50] <%Blackleafx> BASED AND SOBER PILLED
[4:22:51] <%dukenux> Evrart is the epitome of "worst person you know made a great point" meme
[4:22:51] <mariothemaio> there's a hidden check here -- that he resents that they can afford to lose and he can't
[4:23:02] <%Blackleafx> he says, while spiking his workers' lunch with vodka
[4:23:07] <%BernieSandworm> recognition!
[4:23:08] <romc215> #2
[4:23:09] <Pt_Kamen> There's a super hard passive check near the gate the fake scab leader is at. With Woolie's high perception he should go near it and see if it works
[4:23:10] <Johannen> 6 days, quite a hwile
[4:23:12] <derap41> 6 says sober
[4:23:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> hey its something

[4:24:15] <+MrATheGreat> hey level up
[4:24:15] <elshadow7> Is there a chance this is Edgar and not Evrart? He sounds different. Maybe it's just because Joyce left.
[4:24:16] <dave_guns> alcohol bad, now spike the borchst
[4:24:31] <+mads_valentine> OH FUCK HE HAS A LAZY EYE
[4:24:32] <iacus_> going throuhg all the options of conversation ins the game isn't always wise

[4:24:44] <+mads_valentine> THIS IS EDGAR
[4:24:48] <+lordericter> you could have just played better Harry
[4:24:51] <mariothemaio> @elshadow7 it's never clear but you always get the sense they may be swapping because they look the same. one does have a lazy eye though
[4:24:55] <Pt_Kamen> @mads_valentine the only difference from his twin brother
[4:24:55] <+mads_valentine> Look at his right eye!

[4:28:28] <+mads_valentine> God I love Evrart so much.
[4:28:35] <mariothemaio> I love both Evrart and Joyce. They are both deeply fucked but in opposite ways. I love it
[4:28:38] <+lordericter> woof you are super dirty this playthrough huh Woolie
[4:28:42] <DSD24> Ooh don't like that

[4:29:01] <Johannen> Snitching on Acele... NotLikeThis
[4:29:01] <%dukenux> hes lying
[4:29:05] <derap41> oh right
[4:29:08] <Monkeyweed21> Evrart is scum but he's also Martinaise's best hope and that sucks

[4:29:33] <mariothemaio> @Monkeyweed21 Like Manana says - he is corrupt, but corrupt in the interest of Martinaise
[4:29:40] <Monkeyweed21> says the self proclaimed drug lord
[4:29:50] <BurdRightsActivist> YEYEYE KIM

[4:30:45] <Deasmeister> As in shish kebab or the other one?
[4:30:54] <+MrATheGreat> kojkos a slur *reminder*
[4:30:57] <SomeAsianDood> wait did he just drop a slur?
[4:30:58] <elshadow7> The wizard from LotR
[4:30:59] <derap41> really Kojkos the fuck Evrart
[4:31:00] <elshadow7> ?
[4:31:02] <%yusefHD> K word KEKW
[4:31:03] <Prevot> none of these names sound alike evrart
[4:31:08] <mariothemaio> I do like how Acele admits it was her idea to do the drug lab, but she's glad you talked them out of it
[4:31:12] <%Jeshk0> i think he literally killed a guy with a shish keba
[4:31:17] <dave_guns> I don't think Kojko's a slur
[4:31:25] <plsnolookatme> @dave_guns it is
[4:31:27] <elshadow7> Kojko super is a slur
[4:31:30] <Johannen> He took some spoiled meat and killed him by food poisoning
[4:31:32] <AlphaBankai> He won
[4:31:35] <heemwizard> is koijko a slur? dont remember
[4:31:35] <AlphaBankai> Its done
[4:31:36] <SomeAsianDood> kojko's a slur for graad natives
[4:31:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> strong deflection tactics
[4:31:37] <dave_guns> Oh that sucks
[4:31:37] <%DashXero> @dave_guns It is.
[4:31:41] <%dukenux> Forget it Harry, it's Martinaise
[4:31:41] <TCDerps> I thought kipt was the slur
[4:31:42] <derap41> This investigation is OVER
[4:31:48] <asdief_> what did Gary do?
[4:31:50] <Trace_Bovier> time to get back to the actual investigation lol
[4:31:50] <%yusefHD> Snitch on the kids!
[4:31:50] <SomeAsianDood> both are @TCDerps
[4:31:50] <AlphaBankai> Evrat won, nothing more
[4:31:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TCDerps that's the other slur
[4:31:52] <SonofMelonHead> Racist lorry driver uses kojko as a slur
[4:31:53] <WakeUpThrow> The characters who dropped that word until now were Mesurehead and the fat racist driver
[4:31:53] <%DashXero> @TCDerps It is.
[4:31:54] <%livlinn> adumHmm
[4:31:54] <+whiskywolfe> Did you guys forget who was in charge here for a second?
[4:31:55] <Pt_Kamen> communism win
[4:31:56] <derap41> Wire Season 2 all over
[4:31:57] <morow1ec> Evrart doesn't fucking care
[4:32:01] <%dukenux> that can't be the end of the game?
[4:32:04] <%yusefHD> Ayo pls no wire spoilers
[4:32:05] <mariothemaio> I really like how anticlimatic things can be with Evrart. He doesn't care
[4:32:05] <+lordericter> you helped Evrart so you can't try to bust him
[4:32:06] <Hammatime8> Oh well, two bucks materialized in your pocket at least
[4:32:11] <heemwizard> @TCDerps kipt is for black people, kojklo is for the welsh/irish
[4:32:14] <+Telraid> evrart playing 20 dimensional chess
[4:32:15] <skyenoz> well minus the signatures
[4:32:17] <+Sir_Louis> The man on top wins again
[4:32:17] <+lordericter> also you are communist
[4:32:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he played us like a damn fiddle!
[4:32:23] <%yusefHD> PUSH TO THE CREDITS WOOLZ LUL
[4:32:27] <%Jeshk0> Evrart always wins
[4:32:29] <%livlinn> skeleTrolled
[4:32:29] <+MrATheGreat> Please tell me you at least foiled his attempts to destroy the village
[4:32:30] <elshadow7> LIKE A DAMN FIDDLE!!
[4:32:31] <%yusefHD> Feature length stream pls
[4:32:31] <mariothemaio> at least he doesnt get the fishing village
[4:32:32] <primaryfire> everything's coming up evrart
[4:32:33] <derap41> Assuming Joyce doesn't decide to send in the mercs
[4:32:35] <heemwizard> we getting to ruby today?
[4:32:35] <SomeAsianDood> that's like saying you were even playing the game woolie LUL
[4:32:36] <AngryAsian5> It was rigged from the start LUL
[4:32:37] <BlackermanZX> goddamn karma houdini
[4:32:38] <dave_guns> at least the kids got off the drug lab for a while
[4:32:38] <Karhax> Evrart is above your level
[4:32:43] <%DashXero> The fattest player in the game.
[4:32:46] <Trace_Bovier> I'm good to keep going if woolie and Reggie are
[4:32:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:32:48] <%xcompleasedad> NOT QUITE
[4:32:49] <Martianorbit> Bodied
[4:32:51] <BurnySpirit> Sits in a container for the entire game, acts like the most untrustworthy guy ever and with a few words wins a war
[4:32:51] <Prevot> fat evil always wins
[4:32:52] <HomebaseRED> got played like the cheap kazoo that he is
[4:32:56] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's a clever tactic for an rpg
[4:32:57] <BurnySpirit> Thaty's Evrart!
[4:33:03] <Ids560> you can walk in day 1
[4:33:05] <%Jeshk0> theoretically day one
[4:33:05] <dave_guns> Also I feel like Joyce was compromised anyway, there was no other route
[4:33:14] <asdief_> what did Gary do tho?
[4:33:18] <derap41> Woolie you're Murders not Major Crimes
[4:33:22] <Karhax> He's less evil than Joyce
[4:33:27] <dave_guns> is Gary in his house with Morell?
[4:33:31] <%madmanrambler> Joyce had no option after the company sent Krenel in despite what she wanted
[4:33:42] <+Telraid> joyce and evrart are pretty interesting opposites tbh
[4:33:48] <%DashXero> Too bad we can't give him a free lead implant...
[4:33:49] <%Jeshk0> evrart was actually one of the first people that i talked to on day one
[4:33:51] <dave_guns> sending Krenel was the fuckup
[4:33:52] <mariothemaio> @Karhax yeah agreed. Joyce is far more likable, but she's rich and you're a cop.
[4:33:53] <elshadow7> It ain't easy to not get played by Evrart when you literally forgot everything about the world...
[4:33:54] <Ids560> you can do a whole lot on day 1 depending on what checks you do
[4:33:56] <%xcompleasedad> @karhax NO. He’s Beria.
[4:33:56] <Monkeyweed21> Evrart won the moment the mercenaries went rogue
[4:34:00] <dave_guns> literally the worst choice
[4:34:01] <derap41> You can ignore all this completely and just do the murder stuff
[4:34:04] <%dukenux> Do you feel like a hero cop, yet?
[4:34:06] <+Fedhas> sunday friend is the real villain of the game tbh
[4:34:11] <%yusefHD> The SMELL OF THE GAME
[4:34:11] <SomeAsianDood> evrart won the moment the mercenaries even arrived
[4:34:13] <dave_guns> in this case is more like antlers and star
[4:34:13] <mariothemaio> Disco Elysium is not a game you play to feel good
[4:34:14] <%xcompleasedad> The guy is the fucking KGB bastard.
[4:34:15] <zanzibarian_hamster> @asdief_ He's a cryptofascist, he was probably spreading bad info and conspiracy theories abou teverart and the crew, the door was a polite way to tell him to shut the fuck up
[4:34:15] <heemwizard> but the commune failed
[4:34:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Your team already lost before the round began
[4:34:18] <%ppangboi> @Fedhas truth
[4:34:20] <+purps26> Evrart won once the company responded to the strike by hiring the loincloth crew
[4:34:23] <+lordericter> just don't tell Joyce and be a facist
[4:34:25] <Ids560> there are other communists in the game
[4:34:25] <iacus_> yeah Evrart is more pink than red+
[4:34:27] <Tiittamari> manana's cool
[4:34:28] <BurdRightsActivist> Best commie
[4:34:28] <linSP> you can narc on evrart to the Sunday friend
[4:34:29] <+askalta> these guys are soc dem
[4:34:30] <%BernieSandworm> manana is the best
[4:34:32] <Johannen> He is a boiadero..dont insult him with communism
[4:34:37] <ataxia72> howdy everyone how's it been going
[4:34:38] <Karhax> woolie, Sunday friend or Evrart?
[4:34:39] <DelgotHansto> There's a certain way to come out on top, but it's not really you doing it...
[4:34:40] <%xcompleasedad> @linsp WHAT
[4:34:42] <mariothemaio> Manana is cool
[4:34:49] <%Jeshk0> Wild? Wild Pines??
[4:34:53] <dave_guns> @linSP that's so depressing
[4:34:57] <heysamuel> good shit today lads
[4:34:58] <ataxia72> oh.....
[4:35:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh boy tomorrow gonna be goooood
[4:35:01] <Indigo_Automaton> Great stream!
[4:35:05] <heemwizard> see you guys tmr
[4:35:07] <Monkeyweed21> Evrart is a true communist, not because he cares about the individual workers but because he DESPISES the rich @WoolieVersus
[4:35:07] <Martianorbit> Too bad they won’t get the infra-materialism quest.
[4:35:08] <mariothemaio> Sunday Friend is the absolute worse
[4:35:08] <+Fedhas> gg
[4:35:09] <%Burningfajitas> YEEEAH! HARD COOOORE!
[4:35:09] <primaryfire> good prog
[4:35:09] <derap41> only way to "win" is to ignore all the side stuff and just do police work
[4:35:10] <Deasmeister> Eh manana just doesn't want to go to work he even says he's not a communist
[4:35:10] <BurdRightsActivist> We're never gonna get there NotLikeThis
[4:35:11] <+Bitscreed> I'm happy I got to see the church stuff play out.
[4:35:11] <AngryAsian5> Fun sesh
[4:35:11] <BurnySpirit> the end is nigh
[4:35:12] <%Afterman_> that does seem like a good spot
[4:35:12] <karawra> great stream thanks
[4:35:13] <%madmanrambler> so with where we're at, probably 2 and a half more streams or so?
[4:35:14] <heysamuel> tomorrow's going to be incredible
[4:35:14] <Pt_Kamen> tomorrow might be the end
[4:35:14] <+purps26> do they have any side stuff left? or is it the big time tomorrow?
[4:35:15] <skyenoz> @delgothansto wait how?
[4:35:15] <%BernieSandworm> I'm gonna miss the first few hours tomorrow, but I'm excited
[4:35:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> great sesh
[4:35:18] <BurnySpirit> tommorow...RUBY
[4:35:21] <%livlinn> forgottenLiger forgottenLiger forgottenLiger
[4:35:23] <+Mr_Pylon> dance segment all time great scene
[4:35:24] <FassieFons> thank you for the bountiful content
[4:35:26] <SomeAsianDood> its the big time
[4:35:26] <primaryfire> tomorrow is gonna be PACKED
[4:35:28] <%Jeshk0> hows the back?
[4:35:28] <+Bitscreed> Good sesh
[4:35:30] <+TheFrancix> probably the next stream will be the last
[4:35:33] <Deasmeister> Side content complete
[4:35:36] <mariothemaio> god tomorrow is going to be nuts
[4:35:42] <ataxia72> church dance happened in this stream? gotta catch that VOD with quickness
[4:35:43] <%illtima> You're like 1.5 sessions away from the ending!
[4:35:44] <Ids560> honestly in the choice between people like evrart running the show or mr. price stabilite I'd go with evrart every time
[4:35:45] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> We making some real progress. Shit speeds up a bunch at this point @WoolieVersus
[4:35:51] <DelgotHansto> @skyenoz Moralist Vision Quest, in a way, if you do it a certain way
[4:35:51] <SomeAsianDood> yup @ataxia72
[4:35:53] <Indigo_Automaton> If you do one slightly longer stream tomorrow you can totally finish the game
[4:35:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @ataxia72 yeyeye its real good shit
[4:35:54] <+vaderxyz1970> He doesn't care
[4:35:58] <Monkeyweed21> Evrart doesnt care
[4:36:00] <Karhax> Sunday friend, Joyce or Evrart, who would win?
[4:36:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Problem FAR from solved
[4:36:06] <+purps26> Is he done with side quests?
[4:36:06] <Prevot> Evrart doesn't fucking care
[4:36:08] <mariothemaio> @Ids560 yeah, fuck the moralintern
[4:36:09] <dave_guns> Wild Pines leaves Martinaise. The city is better but the town is fucked
[4:36:12] <linSP> evrart wants blood
[4:36:14] <SomeAsianDood> Watch fail of kim authority check on stream?
[4:36:15] <Johannen> @Indigo_Automaton I dont think that's gonna be nessesary
[4:36:17] <morow1ec> In the end, Mr. Evrart helped you find your gun
[4:36:23] <Martianorbit> La Responsibilite
[4:36:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the only thing left i think is the ultralib quest but that doesn't seem to be progressing
[4:36:35] <mariothemaio> Reggie forgot the Chair Battle
[4:36:43] <dave_guns> he pushed the button 30 minutes ago
[4:36:46] <Deasmeister> @karhax Sunday friend wins all this is nothing to him
[4:36:53] <Monkeyweed21> @Karhax Joyce represents a shitty megacorp but she's also a genuinely good person trying her best despite the fact her peers are scum
[4:36:53] <Prevot> Lysanderoth
[4:36:54] <%BernieSandworm> evrart opens by dealing damage, and joyce bribes you LUL
[4:36:57] <mariothemaio> "Harry I wouldn't tell you my plan if you could stop it. It happened 30 minutes ago"
[4:36:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> the mask is fully off now
[4:37:06] <%Jeshk0> nah, evrart isnt really a villain tho
[4:37:29] <TheMagneticDragon> I mean Evrart is trying his damnest to make the system work for others, he just admits he's corrupt in order to do it, Joyce is legit kinda evil
[4:37:35] <Prevot> everyone in power is a villain
[4:37:41] <Prevot> no exceptions
[4:37:49] <%xcompleasedad> @jeshk0 he is SO a villain. The shit he did to get in power…….
[4:37:51] <+MrATheGreat> I’ll disagree. I think Evrart is lying for himself and is thus evil.
[4:37:58] <mariothemaio> My take is Evrart wants to take down Joyce, but only to replace her. He doesn't want to change the system, he just wants to be in control of it
[4:38:03] <Karhax> @monkeyweed21 she could stop the company though, she is just unwilling to sacrifice anything
[4:38:07] <%MTLer> Reggie when are we pissing off your neighbor with farts again
[4:38:14] <Ids560> unsurprisingly, the communist quest has nothing to do with Evrart
[4:38:16] <%dukenux> @Monkeyweed21 is she genuinely good, or is she just really affable
[4:38:25] <TheMagneticDragon> @Prevot Yeah, at least Evrart is straight forward, Joyce just does not care for human life
[4:38:27] <grayskydiver> Melone says that
[4:38:27] <mariothemaio> Or if he does want to change it, it's only so he can control it
[4:38:37] <iacus_> I don't think a guy as slimy as Evrart can even be spun as doing good
[4:38:37] <+askalta> ??
[4:38:38] <%dukenux> OH
[4:38:39] <TheMagneticDragon> @dukenux Affable, she came off as kinda a bitch on my end
[4:38:41] <%Irridium> ???
[4:38:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> ????
[4:38:51] <+mechslayer71> subtle flex
[4:38:54] <dukenux> i thought you meant the Tesla Coil sounds
[4:39:04] <%dukenux> ???
[4:39:10] <%dukenux> T-thanks Elon?
[4:39:15] <Prevot> now THATS a must have feature
[4:39:20] <%MTLer> it really is
[4:39:29] <TheMagneticDragon> But then again, she is kinda an elon musk in this situation and those guys are never good people
[4:39:30] <mariothemaio> @Karhax Except she straight up sacrifices the dock to the union in the hopes of not causing a war with Evrart
[4:39:38] <%dukenux> reminds me of fart button in 2d GTA
[4:39:46] <Prevot> imagine when all cars are eletric and everyone has fart buttons on their cars...
[4:39:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1420054806341816326?s=19
[4:39:49] <%MTLer> yes sir
[4:40:08] <TheMagneticDragon> Conservatives really do tend to be shitheads
[4:40:14] <%MTLer> I don't have that Twitch money's for an X
[4:40:20] <mariothemaio> I think the situation is more complicated than "Evrart bad or Joyce bad", at least in this story
[4:40:25] <%MTLer> yeah 13k$ incentive from gov
[4:40:27] <%KetsuoTaberu> the cyber truck subsidy LUL
[4:40:28] <mariothemaio> in real life, fuck CEOs
[4:40:46] <Prevot> @mariothemaio anyone who thinks either is not bad is compromised
[4:41:09] <dave_guns> @mariothemaio but if things are simple, how am I gonna pass quick judgment?
[4:41:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think you can use normal 120v outlets too, but its obviously really slow
[4:41:11] <%ppangboi> @mariothemaio Agreed, I dunno why people keep brushing past Evrart's equal willingness to spill blood in this situation
[4:41:12] <%Jeshk0> yeah, neither evrart or joyce are good, nor are they villains either
[4:41:14] <dave_guns> not simple*
[4:41:41] <Prevot> it is the future
[4:41:45] <Fabpsi_> Question: Is Disco Elysium going strong for "personal game of the year" for you 2 guys?
[4:41:48] <%KetsuoTaberu> A lot of manufacturers are straight up stopping production of gas cars in 10 years too
[4:41:59] <dave_guns> solve your problems by walking everywhere
[4:42:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Mercedes committed to going all electric by 2025
[4:42:05] <%MTLer> I miss dropping you home after cine Express and getting food from that Chinese place
[4:42:25] <%DatAsuna> emet till would probably still be alive
[4:42:26] <%Burningfajitas> but racism doesn't exist anymore bro get with it /s

[4:45:19] <iacus_> #sundayFriendDidNothingWrong

They have stumbled and time-traveled through a world they have grown to love. Their journey is reaching its twilight, but there is still work to be done. Be vigilant, detectives.

[4:49:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The last Disco Elysium episode might be named wrong.
