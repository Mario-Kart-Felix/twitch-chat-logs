I‚Äôll try not to be too much of a back seat gamer but just thought I‚Äôd give a tip. There‚Äôs heat moves for each style, each weapon type, and even whether or not you‚Äôve grabbed an enemy from the front or back (which you can actually switch positions mid-grab by pressing block). Try Kiryu‚Äôs back heat move into a wall, it‚Äôs raw.

[0:15:54] <%WritebroAlpha> @CappuccinoGuil oh god, that's disgusting. Over here in Britbonglandia, we only have to deal with rich twats, not old rich twats
[0:15:55] <@Menitta> RIAA is also the worst
[0:15:56] <brunoberserk> reggie is already hollowed , before even playing dark souls dnoGEESE
[0:16:05] <%WritebroAlpha> or at least, not that old
[0:16:07] <linSP> How long is a yakoozie game take to 100%
[0:16:07] <+zanzibar_junker> Yakuza 7 knocked 0 for me
[0:16:09] <brachydios777> Yakuza has alot of moves
[0:16:12] <+Tucker0603> what is the RIAA?
[0:16:12] <+krispen_wa> Essence of Transformative Entertainment
[0:16:13] <%aram909> yakuza 0 has so much more depth to its combat than one would initially think
[0:16:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @menitta Worse than the RIA LUL
[0:16:23] <+ThePimpGuin> I hope next stream woolie brings out the white suit
[0:16:25] <%KineKithZen> Shit, I'm skipping to Yakuza 7 with "Essence of Transformative Content"
[0:16:25] <%lordsmaf> Boondocks so good
[0:16:27] <majima666> riaa is the record industry basically i think
[0:16:27] <%doomerskeletor13> @linsp Like 200 hours maybe a little less
[0:16:28] <%Asuterisuku> Cyberpunk in 5 hours!
[0:16:28] <%LastHazzerd> it's so damn good
[0:16:31] <%ChoculaUltra> Riley's Fuck Santa letter should be in a museum imo.
[0:16:31] <%aram909> boondocks season 1-3, not season 4
[0:16:33] <+Stupid121v2> Was the last season as bad as people said?
[0:16:36] <Blank9> king of the hill holds up
[0:16:39] <%RyuuAoi> They need to do a film
[0:16:39] <%dklordg> "your super chill friend RIA"
[0:16:41] <CappuccinoGuil> Legit, Yakuza LAD has become my recommendation to intro to Yakuza games
[0:16:41] <8bitdana> @ThePimpGuin he's gotta
[0:16:41] <%LastHazzerd> Boondocks and King of the Hill are a whiplash of tones
[0:16:47] <+Stupid121v2> KOTH is still a solid 9/10
[0:16:52] <%RyuuAoi> @lasthazzerd Absolutely
[0:16:54] <%aram909> woolie, boondocks season 4 is trash, ignore it
[0:16:56] <%Giothegame> Cheer500 Honestly Japan is weird about having very modern things and also still have companies using fax machines and stamps for signatures

[0:17:01] <Saberkai> king of the hill gets better the older you get
[0:17:04] <seaechiowai> boondocks s4 is shit tho
[0:17:08] <%aram909> aaron mcgruder wasnt involved in season 4
[0:17:18] <%aram909> at all
[0:17:19] <%WritebroAlpha> @CappuccinoGuil look, everyone says you don't need to play the others to play 7, but I PERSONALLY need to play the other before I let myself play 7. Currently halfway through Kiwami 2
[0:17:20] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't S4 the season they did without Aaron McGruder's direction?
[0:17:24] <+GingerSenpai01> WHENS YAKUZA?
[0:17:27] <%Asuterisuku> If it takes six figures to make the record, they're doing something wrong.
[0:17:27] <%KineKithZen> Nobody remembers Mr. Anderson from Beavis and Butthead. Everybody remembers Hank Hill
[0:17:28] <@Menitta> OH MAN
[0:17:29] <%X2Eliah> Japan has a ton of old people, so it makes sense that they stick to old ways of doing stuff a lot more

[0:18:36] <8bitdana> LUL
[0:18:40] <iswearimjustdandy> CAPITALISM CREATES ART YALL
[0:18:47] <%Javaa01> There's a reason successful artists just start their own labels
[0:18:47] <+McSoliace> we have to kill music to save it
[0:18:56] <dundore77> Why would they ever sign that contract?
[0:18:56] <@Solidus_113> Always has been
[0:18:58] <@Menitta> LUL Stunlocked by contract @niddron
[0:18:59] <OldManDeckardCain> music companies trying to be wannabe kingmakers is the reason why so much music sucks today
[0:19:01] <JetpackMcQuack> support indie music
[0:19:02] <+AnimeAnimal93> that's some sharking
[0:19:03] <+krispen_wa> Literally famous because of youtube

[0:19:04] <seaechiowai> sidestep that shit
[0:19:05] <linSP> It‚Äôs time to kill music

[0:19:09] <Mr_Strut> Until now
[0:19:10] <%SjoeB89> Thanks @SkellyVee for the gift subs!!!
[0:19:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> youtube has problems but it at leasts TRIES
[0:19:12] <%WritebroAlpha> The music industry is permanently like 50 years in the past it seems, holy shit
[0:19:13] <+Squiidd_pope> STUNLOCK INTO THE IK CONTRACT
[0:19:14] <iswearimjustdandy> @yuribo26 you me both
[0:19:14] <%LastHazzerd> newer evil is less evil than older evil?
[0:19:19] <zekana> SoundCloud is also pretty good about music
[0:19:21] <GoogleyGareth> It's a case of "I'd rather deal with this small dogshit than this Massive Bullshit".
[0:19:21] <+Tucker0603> youtube good??????? @woolieversus
[0:19:22] <+BaybeeBat> bandcamp is amazing too
[0:19:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @iswearimjustdandy capitalism breeds creativity! That's why every December we get 23536 hallmark movies that are literally the same LUL
[0:19:24] <SpaceLTN> The Entity
[0:19:24] <+b_aleph> papa bless bandcamp
[0:19:25] <TintainiumCan> Guys, please buy from Bandcamp

[0:19:32] <%RyuuAoi> As YouTube is giving Woolie ALL THE SHITS ha
[0:19:33] <%WritebroAlpha> @LastHazzerd old evil is super evil because it's managed to stick around
[0:19:34] <+Slybluedemon> @dundore77 Because they think they will get to make music under the label
[0:19:34] <chainsaw105> so anyway Cyberpunk huh?
[0:19:34] <+krispen_wa> So we gotta go Independent Vegas route then?
[0:19:37] <+Hasmeister96> The entity is Taskmaster and Amazo

[0:20:01] <%masterpiecejeremy> @CAPSLOCKlive That's still happening dude
[0:20:04] <%X2Eliah> MCNs are a twitch thing nowadays, right? All that "Faze Clan" stuff
[0:20:08] <%KineKithZen> Big tech doesn't want to fight the recording industry. It'd be a nightmare that would probably end up making worse legislation for creators
[0:20:10] <poggersbutth013> This is why bandcamp rules
[0:20:12] <seaechiowai> @tintainiumcan I almost read that as Bandicam ThankEgg
[0:20:14] <%WritebroAlpha> @mortificent no we don't, I don't have a cool robot arm
[0:20:15] <GarbageNirvana> It's kinda hard not to be radicalized if you're not already sedated
[0:20:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @mortificent Cyberpunk is cool. We're in Omicron
[0:20:25] <+CAPSLOCKlive> @masterpiecejeremy Yeah it's way less now, but they are still around. But so much less now

[1:10:42] <+GingerSenpai01> FIGHTING ALL DAY!
[1:10:42] <notsoy> getting it "wrong" negatively affects the reward
[1:10:42] <+notsosober9> MAN.
[1:10:42] <+Vivaciousx3> It affects dialogue and rewards
[1:10:42] <+QueequegTheater> Yes
[1:10:42] <Felto3> it just decides the reward
[1:10:43] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:10:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LET HIM PICK WHAT HE WANTS
[1:10:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @1upclock
[1:10:45] <%Josef_Stryker> Yes
[1:10:46] <+superkeaton> lol
[1:10:46] <Darren716> Woolie stop over thinking this
[1:10:49] <alvaroeltz> Dont overthink
[1:10:49] <RagnarokAM> For this sideqyest yes
[1:10:50] <fuji_92> yes
[1:10:53] <+notsosober9> THE PUPPIES ANSWER WAS BETTER
[1:10:53] <@akuda_bar> please don't overthink it
[1:10:53] <brachydios777> You get a reward later
[1:10:54] <honeyman18> Shittier rewards usually
[1:10:55] <GarbageNirvana> you can always get them again in New game plus if you really need to
[1:10:56] <%WritebroAlpha> Reach heaven through violence
[1:10:56] <RagnarokAM> Don't overthink Woolz
[1:10:57] <+QueequegTheater> stop and talk time Kappa
[1:10:57] <DatAsuna> only if you load a save
[1:10:58] <+Stevsux> there is no wrong answer
[1:10:59] <olaksi> like a proper vidja game
[1:10:59] <+Hasmeister96> Yeah pretty much
[1:10:59] <chainsaw105> either way you get the completion
[1:11:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> there's youtube
[1:11:00] <Monkeyweed21> no redos
[1:11:01] <+b_aleph> The puppies one was so much better...
[1:11:02] <%213372bu> no overthink
[1:11:03] <alvaroeltz> Just do it
[1:11:04] <flame_of_udun_> Woolie just pick what you think is funny lol
[1:11:05] <Unmacho> I can't imagine the reward is so good that it really matters if he wins or loses
[1:11:05] <+Solidarity_> if you fuck up just reload, no big deal
[1:11:06] <%Exiliator> One of the funny answers is usually still ok
[1:11:08] <zephyrgun> overthinking is a slow and insidious killer
[1:11:09] <Blank9> you get the completion either way
[1:11:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> fucking chat will ruin this again
[1:11:11] <MyNameIsRasus> In all of them the quest is complete but you get worse rewards
[1:11:11] <%RioGascar> its just rewards, theres no failed quest in Yakuza 0
[1:11:13] <@Menitta> Its not thaaaaaat much different tbh
[1:11:15] <%baronouroboros> dpm'
[1:11:15] <jorniev> WHAT DID I MISS
[1:11:16] <notsoy> technically, there are no items that you can't obtain by an alternate method
[1:11:17] <+Tylerburton> wooo
[1:11:21] <Lieutenant_America> You missed the excitement over Tarashi's BROAD BACK
[1:11:21] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie will never LP OG Persona.
[1:11:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Don‚Äôt overthink it, the only thing that really changes is the reward
[1:11:22] <%Ancopro> sometimes the wrong answer will just back you out to pick anohter one
[1:11:23] <%LastHazzerd> guys... let woolie ask about how the game works.
[1:11:25] <8bitdana> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli theyre not even reading chat though
[1:11:26] <chainsaw105> failing substories? what is this, Yakuza 3?
[1:11:28] <+starpunchghost> its not that big a deal really.
[1:11:30] <fIashman92> It's just different rewards, but no reward is special
[1:11:31] <DatAsuna> the items you get from perfect are rarely strong enough to give up the fun
[1:11:32] <%wanderingdain90> you just get a worse reward. You can't really fail.
[1:11:33] <%ClericOfSparda> This is actually a fine answer
[1:11:34] <+GingerSenpai01> Scumbag save Woolie
[1:11:36] <%bread_assassin> You just get a worse reward. It‚Äôs fine.
[1:11:36] <RagnarokAM> No failed Sidequests in this game
[1:11:40] <$Superdandy96> You can‚Äôt technically fail, you just get a worse reward though right?
[1:11:47] <%ClericOfSparda> it's either that or puppies
[1:11:48] <extradopeness> no auto saves is a godsend fr
[1:11:48] <@Menitta> You can't really fail. You just dont get the best reward
[1:11:52] <flame_of_udun_> Yeah just a worse reward
[1:11:53] <+Vivaciousx3> The only thing that changes is dialogue and rewards, no changes down the line
[1:11:56] <WG101> hell yeah
[1:11:58] <+RowenCleric> yea failed and missable sidequests are old yakuzies
[1:11:58] <%SuperKirby24> the art of fisting

[1:22:04] <@Solidus_113> date those recordings
[1:22:06] <%condemned_15> Substories are the TRUE game

[1:22:19] <%Asuterisuku> You're real close to the Pocket Race place.
[1:22:22] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Quick Change is what you use once you master the high-end stuff. Early game it's best to pick stuff with gun/blade resistance.
[1:22:23] <dabeaminator> @BallerSwagBro9k I'd rather watch this until Cyberpunk unlocks and see the start of the game for the first time myself
[1:22:29] <%doomerskeletor13> The substories are the REAL game
[1:22:30] <flame_of_udun_> Yeah pls don‚Äôt advertise
[1:22:33] <R3c0n31> Side quests are highlights, some are Superior then others

[1:22:40] <%Exiliator> bretty good
[1:22:40] <+krispen_wa> the emotional crime drama is cool and all, but it's all about helping JAV stars with their life problems
[1:22:42] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the show producer quest is my favorite

[1:34:02] <+AugustRei> break all the big boxes and then just punch them to death
[1:34:15] <%Nallex9> Perfect
[1:34:22] <+paladinstarbuster> use the charge attack
[1:34:23] <@Solidus_113> you can charge the normal attacks in beast
[1:34:32] <+notsosober9> Will woolie ever learn that he can charge his punches ...
[1:34:41] <+notsosober9> i think it will take a while for him to realize this
[1:34:43] <chainsaw105> fuck the gun mannequins
[1:34:51] <@Solidus_113> the X charges
[1:34:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Some of the later training for Beast can be a little tedious
[1:34:54] <@Solidus_113> not Y
[1:34:55] <+notsosober9> Charge square...
[1:34:55] <+MrBaldachin> it's mostly for crowds
[1:34:56] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You can charge the X attacks
[1:34:57] <%Nallex9> more for knockdown
[1:34:57] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Training Fallacies in Y0: Rush training doesn't teach you offensive usage. Beast doesn't cover advanced moves. Brawler doesn't cover basic functions.
[1:34:58] <+notsosober9> i mean.. X...
[1:35:02] <BlackermanZX> X charge
[1:35:10] <+notsosober9> Charge X attacks, they are super useful
[1:35:13] <%big_laser_boss> Don't forget about the Y button
[1:35:17] <%WritebroAlpha> Woolie you can charge every attack in Beast mode; imagine you're using Beowulf.
[1:35:25] <+notsosober9> ^ exactly
[1:35:25] <@Solidus_113> you can also still use Y to finish combos
[1:35:25] <%DiscoMatador> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:35:26] <%big_laser_boss> XY does more damage than XXX
[1:35:36] <R3c0n31> Woolie doing it clean

[1:35:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> Easy.
[1:35:45] <%Exiliator> niice
[1:35:45] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> not if you charge the 3rd X
[1:35:46] <%Asuterisuku> Red flashing screen means you've failed.
[1:35:47] <BlackermanZX> got double even
[1:36:02] <WG101> miss tatsu bath water
[1:36:05] <honeyman18> Good job, those get nuts
[1:36:06] <+QueequegTheater> You should always be charging al three X attacks and the Y
[1:36:06] <%Nallex9> Loool
[1:36:09] <%WritebroAlpha> True, you can't charge while holding a weapon, but bare handed you can MESS people up

[1:55:30] <%Livelinne> shiaUGH shiaUGH shiaUGH
[1:55:31] <GenericSoda> dodging does give you heat though
[1:55:34] <%big_laser_boss> it does
[1:55:34] <%RyTYoung> OH NO POOR PAT
[1:55:38] <RyuuAoi> Lame it out! Lame it out! Gotta get the cash! Gotta get the dough!
[1:55:42] <dukenux> GOUGI
[1:55:43] <@Menitta> Once he gets the Rush counter heat move, Shakedown will be a bitch
[1:55:43] <+YouGotCheddared> i found mr shakedown way easier as majima than kiryu
[1:55:44] <DianaTheAscian> @RyTYoung yup
[1:55:46] <%WritebroAlpha> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[1:55:47] <Darren716> Wait he has to redownload the whole thing? Fuck
[1:55:51] <+Mendin> @X2Eliah Peach is a nightbug, Zangief is a puppy, Pat has sleep apnea
[1:55:52] <+Merhabi> At least this game runs
[1:55:53] <%big_laser_boss> doge has many i frames
[1:55:54] <GenericSoda> yeah you can game the fuck out of Shakedown with Majima
[1:55:54] <olaksi> did pat play FF14 all night?
[1:55:56] <madtrixr> god shakedown fights in an alley are always terrible
[1:55:56] <andritt> Cyberpunk is fucking Pat in the ass right now
[1:55:56] <brian_peppers1> Hey guys I have one thing to say : PAT
[1:56:01] <%RyTYoung> @dianatheascian That's suuuucks
[1:56:05] <+krispen_wa> Wha happun to Pat?
[1:56:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Even if Woolie loses here, doesn‚Äôt Shakedowns health go down for the next encounter
[1:56:06] <FrostedZaibatsu> His arms are so long
[1:56:07] <+Story_Ark> @x2eliah no clue. honestly if it werent for being his job, id say he should stop streaming cause its kinda depressing seeing him so dead
[1:56:07] <madtrixr> you can run into him in the champion district and its just dire
[1:56:10] <Solidnick18> OOP
[1:56:11] <%Afterman_> 5 left
[1:56:11] <DedlokPM> @Darren716 I imagine it is some patch that came out after he started
[1:56:12] <CappuccinoGuil> GUN
[1:56:12] <+BeeeOhhh> Been trying this game on my own and I was nervous to join just in case y'all were farther along than me
[1:56:13] <%lordsmaf> got greedy
[1:56:13] <BlackermanZX> GREED
[1:56:14] <+talkingrain3139> Start using the zap/slime gun when you get them
[1:56:14] <+Kullnes> woolz enjoying y0?
[1:56:18] <%Aldesso> greedy son of a gun
[1:56:18] <+Orrjekt> NOT SAFE
[1:56:19] <mattymcfilth> greeeed
[1:56:19] <%Josef_Stryker> Can Pat not grab the motorcycle?
[1:56:20] <GenericSoda> oh man Shakedownin the champion district is dire
[1:56:21] <+Grayhammatter> greedy fool
[1:56:22] <CrazyMedicine> Maximum GREED
[1:56:22] <%Afterman_> 5 heals remain
[1:56:23] <+kewlmyc> He's easier with a weapon, because you can just switch to said weapon and do a heat move for good damage
[1:56:23] <%Exiliator> He punched you so hard it followed you into the menu LUL
[1:56:24] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> That fool, trusting cyberpunk to work as intended
[1:56:25] <+RandoChris> Your punches are slower when your heat is low too
[1:56:28] <%213372bu> NEGATIVE MONEY RIGHT NOW
[1:56:32] <+erictables> You all notice that Hiroya Egashira‚Äôs health bar has the wrong first mame
[1:56:33] <$Superdandy96> 5 heals remain
[1:56:33] <8bitdana> @Josef_Stryker pat?
[1:56:33] <user_naim> You could beast the bike at him
[1:56:35] <%Josef_Stryker> Can Woolie grab the motorcycle?
[1:56:35] <brunoberserk> no greed , play lame
[1:56:35] <majima666> they should have just delayed it for a year or so when it first got delayed
[1:56:36] <DianaTheAscian> @krispen_wa cyberpunk died on the title screen and Pat needs to download the whole thing again
[1:56:39] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:56:41] <+krispen_wa> F
[1:56:43] <%doomerskeletor13> You‚Äôre in debt to him currently
[1:56:51] <Solidnick18> weapons do help
[1:56:53] <honeyman18> remember heat moves with items if needed
[1:56:55] <+Tucker0603> rush is faster than brawler
[1:56:56] <%RyuuAoi> Don't blow your wad now, Woolie! KappaPride
[1:56:57] <%Josef_Stryker> @8bitdana My brain processed Pat because someone mentioned him LUL
[1:56:57] <+tigerfang86> HEATO UPPU
[1:56:59] <+AbnormalVoid> He's FAST
[1:56:59] <+paladinstarbuster> HES NOT USEING THE RUSH DODGE RTHO
[1:57:00] <+vwvwvwvwvvvw> am i the only one who locks on to this mf
[1:57:06] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus If you use Y to end the comb early you can get way more damage
[1:57:07] <GenericSoda> he's crackling with heat
[1:57:09] <%robobeau> Lame it out like X Tekken
[1:57:10] <CoronaVirusIsOver> this is like fighting flamelurker so stressful
[1:57:12] <8bitdana> @Josef_Stryker oh LUL thought that was the case
[1:57:15] <$Superdandy96> Wait until shakedown learns FADC Kappa
[1:57:19] <+Mendin> Crackling with shakedown energy
[1:57:19] <+GingerSenpai01> Use the lock on feature
[1:57:23] <InitialDario> Once it's late game and you learn Tiger Drop shakedown stops being a sweat
[1:57:25] <%Josef_Stryker> But can Woolie grab that motorcycle?
[1:57:30] <GenericSoda> only in beast mode
[1:57:34] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[1:57:35] <+fallenlogan> woolie just use footsies
[1:57:37] <LordOfThePoultry> locking on definitely helps
[1:57:41] <@Menitta> is there a mod for RE2 that replaces MR. X with Mr. Shakedown
[1:57:47] <@Menitta> because there should be
[1:57:48] <GenericSoda> Mr Shakedown has never played Tekken
[1:57:51] <%doomerskeletor13> I‚Äôm sure there is
[1:57:56] <%WritebroAlpha> @Menitta if not there fucking should be
[1:57:57] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye do it woolie
[1:58:03] <%Proxzo> Can you do heat on him?
[1:58:05] <8bitdana> go woolie go
[1:58:05] <%WritebroAlpha> Replace the Mr. X music with this
[1:58:05] <+thackattack00> What about a mod that turns Mr shakedown into mr X?
[1:58:06] <+tigerfang86> TELEPORTS BEHIND U
[1:58:12] <dukenux> @menitta i think there actually is
[1:58:13] <%Josef_Stryker> Yeah u can
[1:58:13] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu has a Short Range Stand.
[1:58:17] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> what about the other way around? @Menitta
[1:58:17] <@Menitta> amazing
[1:58:21] <+Orrjekt> POSITIVE MONEY
[1:58:22] <OldManDeckardCain> *5 hours later*
[1:58:24] <@Menitta> the other way should exist too
[1:58:26] <%Proxzo> does woolie have heat moves?
[1:58:26] <Karhax> Mr Shakedown is a stand
[1:58:29] <DedlokPM> @thackattack00 be a bit harder because there are multiple Mr. Shakedowns
[1:58:32] <GenericSoda> nice dodge
[1:58:34] <Teyaric> Oh man Pat'sCyberpunk crashed and he's losing it
[1:58:34] <alvaroeltz> aighy woolie, you doing good, BUT DONT PISS HIM OFF
[1:58:35] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[1:58:36] <%WritebroAlpha> @Proxzo yeah, you can totally heat move him, but Woolie's not gotten into the habit of heat moves in normal vcombat yet, let alone against SHAKEDOWN
[1:58:37] <%RyuuAoi> Nice dodge
[1:58:41] <Reveresao> This is the same tech I used for fighting him LUL
[1:58:50] <WG101> PHASE 2
[1:58:51] <Ethrion> has woolie unlocked cancelling into dodges?
[1:58:51] <@Solidus_113> now to HEAT UP

[1:59:17] <brianthe12th> if you wanna be risky you can pick up the motorcycle in beast mode and do the heat move where you drop it on his head
[1:59:31] <%lordsmaf> Mr Hubris
[1:59:32] <Enyoyable> The rock solid lack of greed on Woolie.
[1:59:35] <@Solidus_113> DEX vs STR builds
[1:59:36] <LordOfThePoultry> pretty sure he one shots now
[1:59:37] <brianthe12th> but you gotta time that
[1:59:38] <+tigerfang86> LAME IT OUT LIKE CROSS TEKKEN
[1:59:41] <%RyuuAoi> It's fine
[1:59:44] <+Grayhammatter> always lame it out
[1:59:46] <Reveresao> if you get him to do the BIG swing you can do a full combo
[1:59:48] <+Squiidd_pope> TIMER SCAM HIM
[1:59:50] <CoronaVirusIsOver> justin wong would be proud
[1:59:51] <CappuccinoGuil> Nothing personnel, Kiryu
[1:59:52] <%WritebroAlpha> That fucking dodge is terrifying EVERY time
[1:59:54] <Karhax> strongest living being
[1:59:56] <GenericSoda> watch the flying tackle
[1:59:58] <TheHeroAppears> Quick V start telling woolie he's doing a great job and there's no way he can fail at this point
[2:00:00] <chainsaw105> is it the next fight that he starts doing the lunge?
[2:00:00] <%TheNewJapanGuy> *cough* Zap Gun *cough*
[2:00:02] <@Menitta> "he's established that he knows how to play"
[2:00:14] <Jonny_Uppercut> Early on? Shit man I this is how I fought him all game
[2:00:18] <+JonathLP> everytime shakedown dodges behind him, i can feel the blood drain from my face
[2:00:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> bro dodged around you like a bloodborne hunter
[2:00:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @Karhax living ORGANISM. Get it right or you'll be shookethdown by him >:C
[2:00:22] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes

[2:00:29] <honeyman18> Edge this man
[2:00:33] <%RyuuAoi> Also great training, @woolieversus REMEMBER THIS BOUT
[2:00:33] <@Squdnate> My lame out against Shakedown was always this with Rush, then I get 3rd Heat bar, I would switch to either Beast or Brawler and heat move with an item near me
[2:00:35] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Pattern locking? Bleh...
[2:00:36] <+tigerfang86> @FuqBoiSlim Cash Starved Beast
[2:00:43] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Does I use Zap Gun on him
[2:00:44] <+chosenjuan42> can you Heat move Mr. Shakedown?
[2:00:45] <chainsaw105> @QueequegTheater it absolutely does
[2:00:50] <@Squdnate> Yes you can
[2:00:57] <@Menitta> Zap gun for me
[2:01:00] <%abrupt_abe> Slime Gun is preferred cheese
[2:01:00] <thepiefoot> Hits ?
[2:01:00] <%WritebroAlpha> @chosenjuan42 yeah
[2:01:01] <radar410> @QueequegTheater Zap Gun is THE way to deal with him
[2:01:05] <madtrixr> the zap effect doesnt work on shakedown, but he takes damage anyways
[2:01:06] <%abrupt_abe> Can't defend against it
[2:01:09] <GenericSoda> just beat him with Majima's bat
[2:01:11] <%aram909> yeah steel business card owns
[2:01:16] <GoogleyGareth> This entire fight NotLikeThis
[2:01:17] <honeyman18> STAY SAFE

[2:01:19] <ManfredA> slime guns work a treat
[2:01:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:01:21] <+QueequegTheater> No, Brawler is the correct way to deal with him
[2:01:24] <+RandoChris> Googley!
[2:01:26] <C__Lab> mr. shakedowns a flowchart warrior, cant adapt
[2:01:27] <BlackermanZX> COME ON
[2:01:28] <+YouGotCheddared> get greedy!
[2:01:28] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes is fo styling on him
[2:01:29] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye
[2:01:31] <%aram909> the absolute cheat way is with the zap gun
[2:01:32] <@Menitta> "One weird trick to get cash fast. Mr. Shakedown HATES IT!"
[2:01:32] <%aram909> but thats later
[2:01:34] <+paladinstarbuster> DONT CHOKE
[2:01:37] <Sonny_FIRESTORM> Brawler is the easy boring way.

[2:01:39] <%RyuuAoi> P.A.N.
[2:01:39] <g0d_zill4> Not trying to backseat here, but I find that locking on and using the dodge button to avoid Shakedown's charges are much more effective than free running around, gives more time to hit him while he recovers

[2:03:37] <%doomerskeletor13> You do lose half your money in 7 though
[2:03:38] <+QueequegTheater> BEAST HEALTH
[2:03:38] <rysku> there's autosaves though
[2:03:40] <iswearimjustdandy> Having big money aggros shakedowns, so does having basically no money
[2:03:40] <dabeaminator> I think there are hidden checkpoints
[2:03:44] <@Menitta> Whats nice though is that with story fights just reset the fight you lost
[2:03:49] <%big_laser_boss> that only happens on legend
[2:03:50] <LordOfThePoultry> EAT THE MONEY
[2:03:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Make that health bar dick bigger
[2:03:57] <%WritebroAlpha> GET THE HEAT MOVE
[2:03:58] <%Asuterisuku> Aim for the Ms.
[2:04:04] <+Tucker0603> heat move
[2:04:04] <+tigerfang86> a HEAT COUNTER
[2:04:06] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The abilities are not as good as just getting damage up and health up
[2:04:13] <%HollowedIdjit> YO IT'S COOL THO
[2:04:14] <+tigerfang86> there are a lot of walls, woolie
[2:04:14] <+freeizone> eh it's ok, so much work compared to caberet/business
[2:04:14] <+einherjarvalk> BUT IT'S COOL
[2:04:16] <WG101> a very good heat action, mind you
[2:04:16] <notsoy> the back to the wall move is SUPER good against mr shakedown
[2:04:17] <%Ancopro> but it looks rad
[2:04:20] <NemokillerV> is autosave not a thing in zero? Cause I remember that it exists in kiwami.
[2:04:21] <+QueequegTheater> BEAST HEALTH
[2:04:21] <%HollowedIdjit> IT'S SO FUCKING SICK AND EASY TO DO
[2:04:21] <Solidnick18> the cheap are good to get
[2:04:23] <+zepelinnn1> EVERY heat action is worth it
[2:04:27] <%Dapper_Cactuar> IT'S GREAT THO
[2:04:27] <%HollowedIdjit> @WoolieVersus IT WORKS ON SHAKEDOWN
[2:04:28] <%Nallex9> Its so rad tho
[2:04:31] <Nekros4442> Every heat action is worth it
[2:04:31] <WG101> @NemokillerV nope
[2:04:37] <%Aldesso> @WoolieVersus You can edit the ini File to be able to save anywhere. Just google it.
[2:04:37] <user_naim> That wall eat move is so sick and effective
[2:04:39] <%Javaa01> Wakeup Super
[2:04:40] <ManfredA> very good
[2:04:40] <%Ancopro> heat taunt is so good
[2:04:44] <%Josef_Stryker> YES

[2:04:47] <Prevot> excellent heat move
[2:04:47] <GoogleyGareth> WAKE UP
[2:04:53] <%Josef_Stryker> WAKEUP SUPER
[2:04:53] <+AbnormalVoid> Grab a Brush and PUT A LITTLE MAKEUP
[2:04:54] <+RandoChris> PogChamp GET IT
[2:04:54] <Mr_Strut> It is also good
[2:04:56] <+Awkward_Cyborg> Remember to pay a visit to Bacchus :D
[2:05:03] <%tank7013> The wakeup is sick too
[2:05:06] <+tigerfang86> you have to be non-heated
[2:05:07] <+Tucker0603> re-guard is cool
[2:05:12] <+Squiidd_pope> Hide the scars to fade away the shake up
[2:05:13] <+tigerfang86> no BURNING SPIRIT
[2:05:18] <mortificent> Re guard is super useful
[2:05:24] <ManfredA> Brawler is amazing, don't sleep on it
[2:05:24] <TheFranss> then there's Re-Guard 2
[2:05:26] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus get the health upgrades
[2:05:30] <exnuart> calm is no heat
[2:05:48] <%big_laser_boss> Quick-change clothes: You're gonna use all styles
[2:05:49] <thepiefoot> Hot take: all styles are good
[2:05:51] <%Asuterisuku> Hmm, I wonder who you go to to unlock Brawler's M moves.
[2:05:52] <thetrashman_sc> the heat system in 0 is weird
[2:05:52] <+QueequegTheater> Moves you don't use
[2:05:58] <+Squiidd_pope> regard is the GOAT
[2:06:05] <notsoy> golden fist is so good
[2:06:10] <TheFranss> Quick-change clothes for SWORD-TRICK-SWORD
[2:06:10] <notsoy> pick that up, it makes beast hit super hard
[2:06:11] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:06:11] <%guyalex> love how fast 2 mill becomes "free" haha
[2:06:13] <+notsosober9> Woolie, try different combo strings.. X, Y on Brawler is a hard knock down!.. X, X, Y is a STUN that can lead into a grab heat combo!
[2:06:15] <Cobaltor_252> ONE GUY
[2:06:16] <velgaduere> fuckin minmaxers lmao
[2:06:17] <+paladinstarbuster> BUT YOU DONT
[2:06:18] <+Squiidd_pope> just mash that block button if you get guard broken
[2:06:26] <+GingerSenpai01> Yeah money scales up FAST in this game.
[2:06:28] <brachydios777> He has optior

[2:06:38] <%condemned_15> psaDab
[2:06:41] <+notsosober9> I love woolie but he needs to use his options instead of mashing X X X X X Y.....
[2:06:43] <%Javaa01> Or just get into one street fight and get 2mil in a minute
[2:06:44] <Mr_Strut> Spend wisely
[2:06:44] <+QueequegTheater> Get all the 2 before the 30s
[2:06:46] <+GingerSenpai01> It's Free Real Esate
[2:06:50] <%Exiliator> You could go back to the pier
[2:06:51] <brunoberserk> FAIR
[2:06:58] <%Exiliator> Yeah you did
[2:07:00] <+notsosober9> sucks that even woolie is mashing X X X X X like everyone else who plays this.
[2:07:12] <ManfredA> oh you think that
[2:07:14] <+Deano8817> that's fair
[2:07:16] <BlackermanZX> Fair
[2:07:20] <velgaduere> sound logic imo
[2:07:24] <mortificent> fair
[2:07:25] <+Grayhammatter> all the shakedowns

[2:07:39] <+chosenjuan42> Woolie "All BP" Madden does not like health upgrades
[2:07:41] <iswearimjustdandy> He‚Äôll learn the combos calm down yall he just started
[2:07:42] <+notsosober9> @seaechiowai tru

[2:25:19] <%Exiliator> What if your kink is completion points?
[2:25:20] <%condemned_15> World of Kanako is a fucked up movie

[2:25:59] <@akuda_bar> if you know someone who buys teenager's panties... call the police
[2:26:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> they got rid of them not because they were gross, but because the world was making fun of them
[2:26:06] <%Ancopro> they didn't get rid of them they're just gacha machinesblacked out now
[2:26:09] <%WritebroAlpha> Woolie get the free DLC items, they're onlt worth it for the early game
[2:26:11] <dabeaminator> @iswearimjustdandy @tank7013 I was playing off of people joking about kink shaming, I know kink is the wrong word but it fit the conversation.
[2:26:22] <+canseesea> Nouveau Riche is good times, if only to class up the joint.
[2:26:28] <jaygee303> Woolie get the free DLC items
[2:26:29] <@Menitta> Its not like DMC style quicking
[2:26:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> and remember, those vending machines sold panties that overweight grown men worked out in to make them "used"

[2:29:37] <flame_of_udun_> 0
[2:29:38] <+MajorCrasher> 0
[2:29:39] <@Solidus_113> get them all
[2:29:39] <@SoushinSen> 0
[2:29:40] <8bitdana> @MikeNmurdoc 0
[2:29:41] <thepiefoot> I say Y0
[2:29:42] <dabeaminator> As a warhammer player I just think of Command Points when I see CP. Those jokes in the last stream flew right over my head.
[2:29:42] <%Aldesso> get it all
[2:29:45] <%doomerskeletor13> I‚Äôd say 0. either one works
[2:29:45] <%Exiliator> 0 I guess
[2:29:46] <flame_of_udun_> You‚Äôll appreciate 7 waaaay more
[2:29:46] <@Menitta> You can get them all
[2:29:47] <+AugustRei> take all of them it will not unbalance it
[2:29:49] <seaechiowai> @mikenmurdoc lad
[2:29:51] <LordOfThePoultry> get em all
[2:29:52] <%Exiliator> But they are very different
[2:29:52] <honeyman18> For shit funzies, about mid it should be fine
[2:29:53] <Internet_Jorge> its only good for a little bit tho
[2:29:54] <%Aldesso> no it wont. its only usefull erly
[2:29:57] <jaygee303> No it doesn‚Äôt
[2:29:58] <tsunderecactus0> It gives you like...100 million yen
[2:29:59] <DatAsuna> the game is piss easy anyway
[2:30:04] <tsunderecactus0> And a few items
[2:30:06] <@Menitta> Play 0 first. It's a really good one
[2:30:09] <alvaroeltz> not really, def makes it easier
[2:30:12] <%big_laser_boss> @flame_of_udun_ He claims that they make the change animation faster, but they actually lets you cancel attacks
[2:30:19] <DatAsuna> So getting OP items doesn't matter much when the game is already very easy
[2:30:19] <%Exiliator> Thanks Bob
[2:30:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> LIL

[2:34:00] <honeyman18> It's a hoot
[2:34:01] <thetrashman_sc> why does woolie see a lightsaber and think of nmh first
[2:34:06] <seaechiowai> @woolieversus you can recharge after you unlock the crafting npc
[2:34:08] <%WritebroAlpha> It has infinite durability because it has a melee attack, but only 7 shots
[2:34:08] <%cache_22> Does the Marlin cannon count as a gunblade?
[2:34:13] <dabeaminator> But what does this fish get in Trickster?
[2:34:14] <WG101> because NMH is a good game
[2:34:17] <%Asuterisuku> Repairing them is expensive.
[2:34:18] <Mr_Strut> They don't disappear

[2:44:40] <+yukichocomilk> do what you want
[2:44:40] <Ethrion> people get GUN
[2:44:44] <%aram909> you can upgrade your healthbar infinitely

[2:45:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Get ALL the dodging in this style, it's so satisfying
[2:45:53] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie loves a parry
[2:45:55] <%aram909> @DedlokPM even when the physical size of the healthbar stops, if you keep upgrading your health in the secret unlockable style, itll just compress the health in the healthbar so taking hits takes out smaller and smaller portions of the health bar until you can get hit and your health bar will literally not move
[2:45:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Just bobbing and weaving all over the enemies LUL
[2:46:02] <%big_laser_boss> You are misinformed about the Quick-change clothes; they allow you to cancel attacks by style changing.

[3:07:05] <RyuShinden> WOOLIE VS SHOGI
[3:07:09] <jamesthebrave> jesus this is boring
[3:07:11] <%Asuterisuku> Don't play your pieces into Atari.
[3:07:19] <+lugraylucid> Thanks for the 2020Gift @aram909
[3:07:21] <%RyuuAoi> @jamesthebrave For you
[3:07:29] <Darren716> For most
[3:07:29] <%kulmoth> shogi takes forever and i think most matches are won by your oponnent conceding
[3:07:31] <Shishi1205> Imagine if chess matches go the distance how long these matches take
[3:07:34] <jamesthebrave> @RyuuAoi Well, duh
[3:07:44] <%Asuterisuku> This is a learning game.
[3:07:47] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @jamesthebrave chess and shogi are LIT.
[3:07:57] <OblivionSword1> you can undo move with x
[3:08:02] <%dudedude55555> mahjong is better, it's poker on crack
[3:08:03] <%HedgehogGames1> Hopefully he doesn't drop any pieces
[3:08:07] <%Asuterisuku> Clubhouse Games has Shogi available to learn.
[3:08:08] <%RyuuAoi> As always, you don't like it, it won't be missed.
[3:08:09] <Darren716> I'd like to see the stats of how many Yakuza players even touch shogi and the Japanese card games
[3:08:10] <%cache_22> Get Deep Blue Shogi on it.

[3:08:14] <%Asuterisuku> @dudedude55555 Poker meets Rummy on crack.

[3:14:15] <%Asuterisuku> Mahjong is wild and you should try it.
[3:14:22] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> still tho... :( no mahjong makes me sad
[3:14:23] <Darren716> In Kiwami 2 you get a cheat piece super early so I blew through that sub story

[3:14:34] <Haarute> do the beast grab heat move!
[3:14:45] <%RyuuAoi> yay....plot....
[3:14:45] <notsoy> i hope woolie gets to see the car heat move soon
[3:14:54] <+notsosober9> can we like.. stop spamming X X X and use some actual combo strings
[3:14:54] <%Lion_kun> Ain't no one getting 13 orphans.
[3:14:58] <Darren716> The actual worst is the mahjong friend in Judgment
[3:15:02] <%WaifusSansFrontieres> could you imagine the substories we would get if the next yakuza is set in 2020
[3:15:08] <alvaroeltz> beast also has a dropkick if you use the square, triangle combo
[3:15:10] <dabeaminator> Mahjong is a card game? I thought it used tiles kinda like domino pieces
[3:15:11] <%Asuterisuku> The Winds still confuse me in mahjong.
[3:15:12] <WG101> @notsosober9 no
[3:15:16] <Darren716> That makes you win under some specific conditions
[3:15:17] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> @Lion_kun i got that once in the switch club house games.
[3:15:18] <coldhyacinth> isnt like a dragon set in 2020

[3:15:34] <%Lion_kun> I've been playing Mahjong forever and I think I only ever got it once.
[3:15:35] <@Menitta> fuck
[3:15:35] <cornerstorecoroner> This game is so sick
[3:15:41] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ahh, the good ol Wolf Hawkfield BURNING HAMMER
[3:15:45] <+notsosober9> Finally woolie learns that theres more to the combat than spamming X X X X Y
[3:15:50] <supersugoisenpai1> I am way too dumb to be decent at shogi
[3:15:52] <%Asuterisuku> I'd rather just call it Y7, since the whole series is called Like a Dragon.
