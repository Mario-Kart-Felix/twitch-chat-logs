[0:05:40] <%LastHazzerd> i dropped after s1 finished
[0:05:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @aram909 it's slow to start, but it's worth it
[0:05:44] <QueequegTheater> Season 1 was meh but it's so worth it
[0:05:47] <+rancherobill> DONT FUCKING JINX IT, IT CAN STILL SHIT THE BED LIKE GoT!!!
[0:05:53] <Karego_at> the foreshadowing is super real!!!!!!!
[0:05:54] <+kullumanati> Mappa buffered their super bar
[0:05:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I dropped the manga when the cowboy 3d gear users came up
[0:05:55] <halfmasks> those second season chapters werent that strong in the manga
[0:06:00] <%kyh9> What are they talking about?
[0:06:06] <SirCacaPee> What we talking about
[0:06:08] <QueequegTheater> Also god damn the English dub is top tier
[0:06:09] <$dudedude55555> AoT is okay, middle sucks
[0:06:10] <%Noonoox12> attack on titan
[0:06:11] <+rancherobill> Attack on titan
[0:06:17] <nailwind> the final season feels so much better after how much everyone hated the first seasons
[0:06:18] <turbofolk> Woolie couldnt handle not talking about AoT anymore
[0:06:19] <@Solidus_113> The AoT creator once said in an interview "once the series is over and all my fans have screamed out all their tears, I'm going to open a spa and bathe in them"
[0:06:21] <nailwind> we needed that hate
[0:06:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "strongest worldbuilding" One Piece screams
[0:06:29] <%solracc25> Journey to the basement
[0:06:35] <shadowcrisis> Amber Heard level of shitting the bed
[0:06:36] <andre11dr> I haven't seen a single episode of it,i should probably get on it now that i know that it finished good
[0:06:39] <%baka_sugoi> LUL LUL LUL
[0:06:41] <Karego_at> lmaoooooo yea
[0:06:42] <halfmasks> THE BASEMENT ACTUALLY PAID OFF
[0:06:44] <niddron> Eren and Hange's dialogue last episode was great
[0:06:45] <%Noonoox12> PogChamp
[0:06:47] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli One Piece has how much more material?
[0:06:47] <Karego_at> it's so good
[0:06:49] <SherlockianHero> My simple ass: I like One Piece. :)
[0:06:59] <Karego_at> one piece is good too though
[0:07:00] <+Dova573> The armored Titan just wants a QUIET LIFE
[0:07:01] <niddron> can't believe the basement was super worth it
[0:07:02] <+kullumanati> Just talk anime
[0:07:02] <SirCacaPee> I like one piece but there is way too much fluff
[0:07:02] <%Invlux> "Tell us about the Armored titan" slow camera pan
[0:07:03] <valriot> People will hate the show AND the ending, BUT FUCK THOSE GUYS
[0:07:03] <nailwind> its so much more now LUL
[0:07:04] <jaybird_hero98> Sameee I had to rewatch the series before the new season of AoT cuz I’m kinda a dum dum lol
[0:07:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Reverend_Roscoe 1000 chapters? Why does that matter
[0:07:06] <%kyh9> Or "Isn't that the thing about the fascism?
[0:07:13] <TomoeMoeGozen> macrophilia anime
[0:07:13] <MyNameIsRasus> That new OP too SourPls
[0:07:15] <piecks_butt> Pieck's butt
[0:07:17] <niddron> we beyond that, that was the good old times
[0:07:19] <+kullumanati> Not really lol
[0:07:24] <+Mr_Pylon> it's all meat gundams
[0:07:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli AoT has accomplished more with less
[0:07:25] <+Ancopro> isnt eva the mech show Kappa
[0:07:27] <TomoeMoeGozen> legit thought it was a vore fetish show at first
[0:07:27] <$dudedude55555> I rabu piku
[0:07:29] <shadowcrisis> one piece needs to end with their over 900 episodes...shits getting wack
[0:07:30] <valriot> OHAYO PORCO
[0:07:30] <andre11dr> That's like me LUL
[0:07:37] <Dave_VD> Giant zombies is still a great premise
[0:07:37] <piecks_butt> based and rabupilled
[0:07:38] <Reveresao> @WoolieVersus Did you pause Korra?
[0:07:42] <@akuda_bar> rezero doesnt even compare to AOT at all lmao
[0:07:45] <%illtima> Re: Zero? More like Re: Zero out of Ten
[0:07:52] <+xerotwo> I'm still on Re-Zero S1, kind of traumatizing
[0:07:54] <turbofolk> From Giant Zombie horro to Meat MEcha drama
[0:07:55] <@akuda_bar> re; harem
[0:07:55] <piecks_butt> pii.
[0:07:56] <$Spydurman> @WoolieVersus I totally thought AoT was dead cause I'd only seen it on Netflix. Until I found it on Hulu a month ago and caught up
[0:07:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> S2 POPS OFF
[0:07:58] <+wolfofsound> @illtima LUL
[0:07:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli not more, but compare the things that happen in 70 episodes of one piece compared to AoT
[0:08:04] <%Noonoox12> tbh I totally dropped off Re:Zero S2. It just feels too bland to me
[0:08:05] <+Jiggisnipe> no intro *disgusting*
[0:08:08] <turbofolk> YEAH RE:ZERO SHILLING LETS GO
[0:08:13] <SirCacaPee> Why does THIS MAN look like hes about to conduct an ORCHESTRA
[0:08:13] <+kullumanati> Are there multiple Re zeros?
[0:08:13] <+xerotwo> AND A MOVIE
[0:08:26] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @SirCacaPee you must be new here
[0:08:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Reverend_Roscoe Again why does that matter? World building is still world building and One Piece has world builded the shit out of those 1000 chapters
[0:08:27] <%Ether101_Prime> Isn't RE:Zero a sequel?
[0:08:31] <mrblack499> re:zero is good so fuck you lol
[0:08:32] <MyNameIsRasus> Shouldn't ReZero Season 2 be ReOne
[0:08:32] <niddron> I kinda enjoyed S1 more though, the sanctuary arc is kinda dragging for me
[0:08:33] <+xerotwo> BTW WATCH PUI PUI MOLCAR doodStare
[0:08:34] <QueequegTheater> Being Subaru is suffering
[0:08:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @noonoox12 u probably dropped it right b4 the big pop off

[0:08:51] <MyNameIsRasus> UH OH
[0:08:57] <shadowcrisis> one piece has turned into boruto...utter shite
[0:08:58] <$arcielardor> Hey Woolie, you ever read Kill Six Billion Demons? it has Old-school angels, punch-girls and demons.
[0:09:00] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli then why does One Piece scream when they say that AoT has great world building?
[0:09:03] <MyNameIsRasus> It's very average
[0:09:04] <+xerotwo> WHEN'S KONOSUBA S3 doodStare
[0:09:08] <niddron> hey dying sucks!

[0:13:15] <nailwind> @wolfofsound Kreygasm
[0:13:16] <%aram909> I am currently freezing my ass off here in Texas, had to turn off water and keep the heat at like 60 to make sure there aren't any more power fluctuations
[0:13:16] <%Noonoox12> The endgame grind's tough. I dropped the game the first time 'round, but Radient mode did a great job making it work out
[0:13:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DD took me over 100 hours
[0:13:24] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Saw you get bodied by a vtuber
[0:13:25] <+xerotwo> gotta WORK for WEEB STUFF

[0:14:02] <%Invlux> Invlux subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! If we're going for pre-stream anime, I'm going to give everyone the recommendation to watch Wonder Egg Priority, it definitely goes into a lot of traumatic stuff but it's a "just watch it :) " show
[0:14:12] <%aram909> @Safarihat yeah theyre trickling now and ive got some water boiling on my gas stove
[0:14:15] <%X2Eliah> Don't say that minh is teamviewer-ing into it

[1:30:05] <$dudedude55555> just block
[1:30:06] <Estwilde> That's the Jimmy Hoffa advice yes
[1:30:06] <Karego_at> do not run towards a gun what????
[1:30:09] <Prevot> the actual advice is SHOOT FIRST
[1:30:09] <$dudedude55555> hold R
[1:30:10] <%doomerskeletor13> SURVIVING EDGED WEAPONS
[1:30:11] <Solidnick18> basics of cqc
[1:30:14] <%Holycow8498> Remember knives can be thrown
[1:30:17] <niddron> always run away from knife, not worth it
[1:30:17] <Estwilde> Run from a knife, run towards a gun
[1:30:18] <+ItsSansom> Yoooo this is my first time catching the stream live
[1:30:18] <%Juriasu> just zig zag and gun guy will never hit you
[1:30:19] <+Balkespower> Everyone with martial art experience will say to leg it.
[1:30:21] <fluke_LKZ> Just EX-dodge the bullet.
[1:30:21] <+MrAtheGreat> Surviving edged weapons on red letter media is the freaking best.
[1:30:21] <Karego_at> *bigger
[1:30:22] <linSP> the internal bleeding killed them not kiryu
[1:30:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> RYU?!
[1:30:23] <NorthGrizzly> Knife in close range is more daeadly
[1:30:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @doomerskeletor13 I want to watch that fucking movie
[1:30:26] <%dukenux> Ken?
[1:30:29] <leith_aziz> KEN ?
[1:30:29] <%kinetikpaws> what if he has a claymore
[1:30:33] <austinj24> U ninja run towards the bullets right Woolie?
[1:30:34] <Ecliptic_Origins> KEN?
[1:30:38] <LVL1_Scumbag> Always
[1:30:41] <DrkJP520> Spread your arms to make yourself look big so that the gun gets scared.
[1:30:43] <+Tucker0603> you run towards a gun you're making a bigger target
[1:30:45] <%Ether101_Prime> It depends on where you are.
[1:30:46] <+wolfofsound> Just pull out your katana, duh
[1:30:47] <%psidefx> GET FUCKIN IN!!
[1:30:49] <$dudedude55555> if someone pulls a gun, you pull 2 guns
[1:30:50] <LVL1_Scumbag> Number one rule is get the fuck out.
[1:30:52] <coracor> RUSHDOWN
[1:30:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just do a heat move
[1:31:03] <OokamiDen02> GO FOR THE LIVER
[1:31:04] <binaryanomaly16> Judgement cut him, obviously
[1:31:05] <$SWFanatic> Choose life
[1:31:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> Everything else if when rule one has failed
[1:31:07] <+MosesUnspoken> Bat vs Knife
[1:31:08] <QueequegTheater> 21 foot radius
[1:31:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Use the i-frames of the heat move
[1:31:10] <%gatorafan> Zone them out
[1:31:11] <EX_shuffle> Slap the bullet
[1:31:12] <DatAsuna> guns work point blank
[1:31:20] <leith_aziz> I definitely remember when Ken broke the arm of a criminal
[1:31:27] <mephium> but what if the bullets fall down and hit you
[1:31:28] <QueequegTheater> At point blank you can grab their arm
[1:31:29] <mystogan73> lol
[1:31:30] <nailwind> strip naked and intimidate
[1:31:31] <$Nested_Dreams> Rule number 3 is self-defence does not justify murder
[1:31:34] <LVL1_Scumbag> Or Dio
[1:31:34] <%Juriasu> just lay down and accept defeat tbh
[1:31:36] <%psidefx> I GUESS I"LL DIE

[1:31:45] <+wolfofsound> GET DOWN MR. PRESIDENT
[1:31:47] <OokamiDen02> noooooooooooo....
[1:31:48] <$SWFanatic> Guns for show, knives for a pro
[1:31:48] <mrblack499> break hands ?
[1:31:52] <%JustToWatch> Simply stop time and pluck the bullets out of the air
[1:31:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BAM
[1:31:55] <%krispen_wa> @nested_dreams number 3 is a dumb rule
[1:31:56] <+Ancopro> definitely doesn't happen more than once a yakuza story

[1:34:59] <Ner234> This guy is getting FUCKED up
[1:35:01] <%X2Eliah> Woolie has seen the kettle at least
[1:35:01] <andre11dr> The boiling water is still the most brutal one for me
[1:35:03] <%Halospaz117> WELCOME TO THE SALTY SPITOON
[1:35:07] <jetjagger222> has woolie seen the box of nails
[1:35:07] <%kinetikpaws> that guy can go to the salty spitoon now
[1:35:13] <chainsaw105> weaponmasters keep their weapons no matter what
[1:35:14] <%ChoculaUltra> he still had nails in his mouth I bet
[1:35:22] <DrkJP520> I think they drop the knife normally, but this is a special fight. (I might be wrong)
[1:35:25] <rosemon5001> for this tutorial it doesnt drop
[1:35:25] <%r0chelimit> On normal enemies they drop the knife. On bosses they keep it
[1:35:25] <+hypecactuar> ayye wooolie!!
[1:35:28] <whiteblacklight74> beast
[1:35:28] <%X2Eliah> Do you think one of the nails went into his eye?
[1:35:30] <%big_laser_boss> Use your heavy finishers
[1:35:32] <%Asuterisuku> High heat and also Beast.

[1:35:43] <leith_aziz> Bosses with knives dont drop it
[1:35:44] <OokamiDen02> a few times
[1:35:45] <%Holycow8498> arm is gone
[1:35:47] <andre11dr> Also Majimas scimitar heat moves are fucking crazy brutal
[1:35:48] <EX_shuffle> Broken skull, shattered arm, nails in the roof of his mouth. Just end him
[1:35:48] <exnuart> you're staggered by stabs not slashes
[1:35:51] <HedgehogGames1> Regular enemies drop the knife, but stronger enemies like minibosses keep it.
[1:36:05] <%psidefx> HOW TOUGH ARE YA?
[1:36:05] <%aram909> NAILED IT\
[1:36:07] <QueequegTheater> AND THEN KICKED
[1:36:14] <velgaduere> you have a knife? I have NAILS
[1:36:16] <$SWFanatic> EEEY BOY you don't have to murder a guy just cuz he wants some porn
[1:36:20] <%notsoy> you can do the same heat move with firecrackers lmao
[1:36:21] <Solidnick18> punched then kicked
[1:36:21] <leith_aziz> I feel like thats as brutal as it ever gets
[1:36:24] <fluke_LKZ> "That was a bit too much, boy."
[1:36:27] <%Seancicle> gotta jet
[1:36:29] <+Jiggisnipe> that's Yakuza as a series. "Creative"

[1:36:43] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL LUL LUL
[1:36:47] <RyuShinden> "You sure you did not kill anyone boy?"
[1:36:47] <%gatorafan> I'm beginning to have second thoughts
[1:36:47] <$vectorcannonready> Is Kiriyu just Japanese Batman?
[1:36:50] <@Menitta> CSI Miami YEAAAAAAA
[1:36:58] <TheNexusArc> woolieF
[1:37:00] <DrkJP520> First time I'm here. You doing all the substories?
[1:37:02] <%Holycow8498> Yes @vectorcannonready
[1:37:04] <+Ancopro> not more than real estate
[1:37:06] <%dukenux> Better Batman
[1:37:14] <%big_laser_boss> not at all
[1:37:14] <@Menitta> Its kinda shit
[1:37:18] <Solidnick18> it's okay
[1:37:26] <QueequegTheater> Do it offstream
[1:37:32] <Astrophizz> it's pretty random
[1:37:35] <%Holycow8498> Yea do that off stream
[1:37:35] <%X2Eliah> Do it offstream
[1:37:37] <%aram909> do it offstream, also imo its not worth it
[1:37:38] <QueequegTheater> Kiwami's version is better
[1:37:40] <Spagheddies> It's kinda bullshit. The CCS. Odds are rigged against you most of the time.
[1:37:41] <Karego_at> the catight is shit, not worth it for the money, just cheese mr shakedown
[1:37:42] <%Asuterisuku> That game gets repurposed later.
[1:37:42] <RyuShinden> Better do it offstream
[1:37:43] <%doomerskeletor13> I think some people came up with a strategy that kind of works
[1:37:43] <%jaguarkek318> rng all the wya
[1:37:43] <Prevot> it's a shame they made it RPS instead of just letting you play as the girls
[1:37:44] <fIashman92> Pretty sure that one is heavy in your favor
[1:37:47] <OokamiDen02> do it offstream
[1:37:47] <%aram909> once you get going in real estate you make way way way more money
[1:37:48] <TerrifyingRei_05> rng I bullshit
[1:37:49] <GhostRavens> i agree, do it off stream
[1:37:51] <%aram909> and thatll happen soon enough
[1:37:51] <jetjagger222> do it doucement
[1:37:56] <MyNameIsRasus> with the science team
[1:37:59] <PortableBoredom> Why's everyone saying to do it off stream
[1:38:11] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[1:38:13] <GhostRavens> LUL
[1:38:14] <%psidefx> ONLYWOOLZ SUBBED
[1:38:14] <DrkJP520> Also, make sure your girl is out
[1:38:15] <%Asuterisuku> Because Twitch guidelines regarding nudity, I assume.
[1:38:16] <winner_92> dear god that's a lot of stamina royale
[1:38:16] <RyuShinden> monkaS
[1:38:17] <coracor> monkaS
[1:38:17] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus They reused it in Kiwami and it's way better implemented there
[1:38:18] <enZymeth> She can join in
[1:38:19] <$SWFanatic> Big oof
[1:38:19] <andre11dr> If this was Like A Dragon you could get high luck but that's sadly not a thing
[1:38:20] <Mr_Zero5232> Because crime time!
[1:38:20] <%aram909> @PortableBoredom gee i wonder why
[1:38:24] <AvroEltz> Stop playing strive for some cat fighting
[1:38:24] <whiteblacklight74> wooltuber
[1:38:29] <%gatorafan> when girls are not watching monkaS
[1:38:30] <PortableBoredom> There's no nudity in this game, what are you people spazzing about
[1:38:31] <CappuccinoGuil> Nah nah, invite her to watch for date night Kappa
[1:38:41] <downwiththethickness99> There is a way a to cheese the Rock Paper Scissors bit apparently
[1:38:46] <QueequegTheater> @winner_92 That's nothing, on Legend you should literally always have nothing but Royales in every spot
[1:38:49] <%r0chelimit> Real estate and shakedown have better, more reliable pay offs imo
[1:38:54] <CappuccinoGuil> @PortableBoredom because twitch is finnicky and he doesn't even want to run the risk of getting fucked over?
[1:38:55] <%Asuterisuku> Better to be safe than sorry for this kind of thing @PortableBoredom
[1:39:04] <+wolfofsound> pay for woolie custom vids on his onlyfans. His free step bro video will be sure to get you to follow
[1:39:13] <Mr_Zero5232> @portableboredom yeah all I’ve seen is oddly placed Reggie heads
[1:39:27] <%X2Eliah> Let's be real, a Woolie Onlyfans would just be horrible food takes
[1:39:33] <+b_aleph> wtf? Yakuza? What happened to GG?
[1:39:36] <@Solidus_113> OnlyFoods
[1:39:51] <%psidefx> Woolie's OF ould be building fight sticks

[1:40:13] <%Holycow8498> Oh yeah the radio show
[1:40:14] <Mr_Zero5232> @psidefx I’d sub to that
[1:40:17] <+Jiggisnipe> @b_aleph the beta has really inconsistent times according to WOolie
[1:40:17] <OokamiDen02> yes
[1:40:20] <+wolfofsound> shucks howdy
[1:40:20] <%Holycow8498> This totally is the cowboy show
[1:40:22] <Saltmeisterr> The Big O?
[1:40:22] <%X2Eliah> yup
[1:40:25] <%Holycow8498> on Bebop
[1:40:29] <@Solidus_113> "this is a good podcast"
[1:40:33] <fIashman92> And he likes everything
[1:40:33] <%psidefx> @Mr_Zero5232 SAME!
[1:40:34] <%Holycow8498> This is totally absolutely the bounty hunter show
[1:40:35] <PortableBoredom> I assume the sex stuff only applies if there's actual nudity, but okay I guess
[1:40:36] <%Ether101_Prime> Cowboy Bebop and Yakuza, hmm.
[1:40:37] <AngryAsian5> Kiryu is a man of focus
[1:40:37] <chainsaw105> How y'all doin"?! And now its time for BIGSHOT!
[1:40:47] <whiteblacklight74> if it was today it'd be a vtuber
[1:40:48] <%X2Eliah> @PortableBoredom Well you would think so
[1:40:49] <EX_shuffle> Is it normal to get caught in a loop when I get punched in the back? Anytime it happens I can't play for like 30 seconds
[1:40:49] <%tank7013> Kiryu doesn't get in, Kiryu GETS IN

[1:50:50] <%Juriasu> too late
[1:50:51] <+Lazy_Vagabond> need to land the backhand into a knockdown
[1:50:51] <%Asuterisuku> Too slow.

[1:50:54] <ARDM112> IT'S ON KNOCKDOWN
[1:50:55] <%big_laser_boss> only Y has to land

[1:51:06] <Vashido22> no need to time it
[1:51:06] <Karego_at> too slow
[1:51:08] <%Jetzord> just press y twice in a row
[1:51:10] <Haarute> don't wait for the final one
[1:51:12] <%Jetzord> don't wait
[1:51:12] <@akuda_bar> press the xxx and the yyy
[1:51:17] <+Deko_> you can mash it no need to wait
[1:51:20] <Vigogs> can't you just mash Y after doing the finisher I remember it being it like that
[1:51:21] <Vashido22> no need to wait, just mash it
[1:51:23] <RyuShinden> Just mash the Y
[1:51:25] <%JaseAdrift> this just in woolie cant do combo

[1:51:38] <%big_laser_boss> Also Y attacks usually has more damage then all previous X
[1:51:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Superman punch!
[1:51:39] <Vashido22> yup
[1:51:42] <%Invlux> The buffering is HUGE
[1:51:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YAKUZA 3: BLOCK OF LIFE
[1:51:45] <Vashido22> thats yakuza 3
[1:51:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yakuza 3 is rough
[1:51:48] <spinalhallucegenia> BLOCKUZA
[1:51:49] <%Asuterisuku> Y3 does NOT have enough ways to break turtles.
[1:51:49] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie the fighting game player can't do combos Kappa
[1:51:50] <%Javaa01> Yeah Yakuza 3 is called Blokuza 3 for a reason
[1:51:50] <+abrupt_abe> Yakuza 3 is infamous for that
[1:51:55] <+RealPT1> this looks like a DMC combo
[1:51:59] <%Holycow8498> Yeah Yakuza 3 has the most block heavy enemies
[1:52:04] <%Holycow8498> and its not fun
[1:52:04] <thetruenicster> They do the same thing in Yakuza 6, I felt like, with the blocking
[1:52:09] <twoto858> I never understood how he's able to flip
[1:52:11] <brunoberserk> yakuza 3 : ROYALGUARD
[1:52:13] <%big_laser_boss> Golden rule is to get around enemies' backs
[1:52:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> nah in Yakuza 6 everyone flies off to your punches
[1:52:21] <%X2Eliah> So but jokes aside though, what is the difficulty with this one?
[1:52:22] <Memitim> didn't expect to see yakuza today, nice
[1:52:29] <%Holycow8498> normal i think
[1:52:31] <%Juriasu> yeah should mash it so it comes out before he is on the ground
[1:52:32] <stormhawk9891> Now he's going too slow
[1:52:32] <shorololo> no need to go slow
[1:52:35] <syanplague> the only thing i don´t like about yakuza the characters block and you don´t have a guard break per say so the best way to fight is to just dogde when they attack
[1:52:41] <%tank7013> I love that he lays himself out with that attack
[1:52:42] <Vashido22> you dont need to go slow
[1:52:42] <%Javaa01> Okay now get the nails
[1:52:52] <QueequegTheater> @X2Eliah He tends to reguard a lot and you have to land the finisher to trigger it
[1:52:55] <KeiganOfAstora> Hold up a second. Woolie isn't feeling well so the streams with Reggie are cancelled but it's okay for V to come over? Woolie, the only way to be safe is to isolate and get tested dude @WoolieVersus
[1:52:58] <%big_laser_boss> only the last attack
[1:53:26] <%Holycow8498> Its a really cool move
[1:53:28] <QueequegTheater> Use bike
[1:53:30] <%big_laser_boss> only Y needs to land
[1:53:31] <%X2Eliah> @KeiganOfAstora relax, he is obviously ok

[1:53:38] <%psidefx> RECOME KNEE
[1:53:41] <+johnnychopsocky> ah yes, Essence of JACK PUNCH
[1:53:56] <+Balkespower> there is a damage scaling going for using the same heat move over and over
[1:53:58] <%big_laser_boss> good, use those heavy finishers
[1:54:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> When is essence of sucker punch
[1:54:07] <+Jiggisnipe> @KeiganOfAstora it was a ruse, he just wanted to play Strive
[1:54:10] <%Holycow8498> Yeah the heat bar is kind of like a style meter though not exactly
[1:54:16] <%Asuterisuku> Unless you're fighting Sumo guys.
[1:54:16] <KeiganOfAstora> Right. Obviously, because we all know COVID can't be asymptomatic. Just be safe Woolie

[2:06:46] <%Holycow8498> Kiryu is a friend to children

[2:06:58] <@Solidus_113> put in work and it's all for the kids, but these cats forgot what work is
[2:06:59] <T_Sasquatch> OH MY GOD the foreshadowing
[2:07:03] <hassanico2> Kiryu LOVES the CP
[2:07:04] <HedgehogGames1> I ruined that one kid, but look I saved this one!
[2:07:04] <%solracc25> Pocket Fighter
[2:07:06] <%Jetzord> Woolie loves kids. does it for the CP
[2:07:07] <QueequegTheater> THAT SMILE IS FUCKING NEFARIOUS

[2:07:13] <RyuShinden> HI MIT SU~
[2:07:15] <%eyezehuhh> Kiryu loves children more than people
[2:07:15] <strudel_h> :)
[2:07:17] <downwiththethickness99> The first one is something that actually happened irl. People legit mugged each other for Dragon Quest III.
[2:07:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:07:19] <velgaduere> NEVER.
[2:07:20] <velgaduere> EVER.
[2:07:21] <winner_92> god that fucking head turn kills me
[2:07:24] <%X2Eliah> @eyezehuhh phrasing
[2:07:24] <%solracc25> you can read this one
[2:07:26] <%Holycow8498> Kiryu is like gamera a friend to all children
[2:07:30] <%gatorafan> it's okay, no sex on this one, just violence Kappa
[2:07:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yeah because after this he can never smile FeelsBadMan
[2:07:35] <+BaybeeBat> first half of Y3 is kiryu happy time too
[2:07:36] <Zayasu> no
[2:07:41] <whiteblacklight74> @HedgehogGames1 Ruined? He became sohphisticated
[2:07:42] <%ThisIsLloyd> i dont
[2:07:50] <Blank9> kiryu's ideal career is Tier 3 Sub
[2:07:53] <%Ether101_Prime> I feel Kiryu's the straight man in a world full of jokers.
[2:07:54] <T_Sasquatch> substories may as well be a different game
[2:07:56] <%Asuterisuku> Kiryu is almost never actually a Yakuza, making the title of the game in the West kind of pointless.
[2:08:00] <TerrifyingRei_05> SERIOUS CRIME DRAMA
[2:08:03] <fIashman92> Telephone club plz :)
[2:08:03] <whiteblacklight74> CP check
[2:08:05] <LittleWulfie> Bowling won't go yet
[2:08:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Always with the cp
[2:08:06] <%solracc25> you still do work for crime people
[2:08:10] <%Holycow8498> You def have enough to level things up
[2:08:11] <%Juriasu> oh god it's at 46 hours already
[2:08:13] <%X2Eliah> He's not yakuza that often, but he always deals with yakuza
[2:08:18] <%Asuterisuku> Has he talked to Sushi Gin yet?
[2:08:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the longest Kiryu has been a Yakzua is in Yakuza 1 and even then that wasnt that long
[2:08:21] <@akuda_bar> @Asuterisuku and link is almost never Zelda
[2:08:27] <RyuShinden> @Asuterisuku Tell that same statement to Ichiban LUL
[2:08:27] <whiteblacklight74> V says Check Your CP!
[2:08:37] <%solracc25> Complete bowling for a good prize
[2:08:38] <@Solidus_113> There's another great substory you can start around Theatre Square
[2:08:39] <+Ancopro> and thats just kiryu
[2:08:40] <+Balkespower> 100 HOURS
[2:08:40] <%gatorafan> This is why it's called "Like a Dragon" on JP, because we do Dragon stuff Kappa
[2:08:40] <QueequegTheater> THAT'S ONLY KIRYU'S
[2:08:41] <winner_92> yeah there are a LOT of substories
[2:08:42] <enZymeth> For Kiryu
[2:09:03] <Spagheddies> Woolie still hasn't done the pizza quest.
[2:09:04] <hassanico2> When does Kiryu do that sidestories?
[2:09:08] <andre11dr> Iea remember when Majima was about to murder that blind girl? Hahaha funny sidequests haha
[2:09:14] <Spagheddies> Huge monkaS when he gets there, though.
[2:09:16] <OblivionSword1> NNice

[2:09:18] <%big_laser_boss> YOU CAN GET IT NOW
[2:09:18] <%Ether101_Prime> @Asuterisuku Yeah, the Japanese tittle is really fitting because he basically is treated like a dragon.
[2:09:22] <%Asuterisuku> Excellent use of cash

[2:11:08] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:11:09] <atgithursdays> Jesus wept Woolie how long will it take for you to learn your left from your right
[2:11:09] <Josef_Stryker> Awww
[2:11:15] <QueequegTheater> He mashed too good
[2:11:18] <%Juriasu> yes that was a good line
[2:11:18] <Prevot> wow great tech
[2:11:27] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:11:28] <QueequegTheater> holy shit
[2:11:30] <OldManDeckardCain> damn, that strive beta messed him up LUL
[2:11:33] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's how it's done
[2:11:34] <winner_92> that's a sick strat
[2:11:40] <%eyezehuhh> SICK
[2:11:41] <OblivionSword1> I never knew this tech
[2:11:42] <%big_laser_boss> nice thech
[2:11:43] <%X2Eliah> works irl
[2:11:43] <T_Sasquatch> thats bullshit
[2:11:48] <@akuda_bar> i do this irl Kappa
[2:11:56] <+noajenkk> it "ruins" it until you realize exploiting minigames in yakuza makes your life SO much easier
[2:12:00] <+noajenkk> unless there isnt an exploit for it
[2:12:04] <+BaybeeBat> SONOVABITCH
[2:12:04] <%Asuterisuku> Sometimes add a bit of curve
[2:12:11] <%Juriasu> you adjust with the spin if the tap is off
[2:12:13] <%Javaa01> Yeah if you tap slow, you can always correct by correcting one to the left
[2:12:23] <MyNameIsRasus> If you're off spin it to the right
[2:12:25] <hkgamingtv> This is how I did it after hours of frustration
[2:12:28] <+MrAtheGreat> Huh, I went for the one that went over th center and tapping left twice
[2:12:29] <winner_92> you can correct it with spin yeah
[2:12:32] <%X2Eliah> is that enough?
[2:12:36] <QueequegTheater> That fucking 5 pin
[2:12:40] <+xerotwo> doodOne
[2:12:44] <T_Sasquatch> damn this is rough
[2:12:49] <+Liquid_Dio> Do well, not perfect
[2:12:51] <panlakes> The claw game you don't need a gimmick for but I dont know if there's a point to getting all those
[2:12:51] <%X2Eliah> SPIN
[2:12:52] <%Asuterisuku> Add spin.
[2:12:54] <@SoushinSen> could have adjust with the spins..
[2:12:56] <dante_suoh> does it work with heavier balls?
[2:12:56] <%Ether101_Prime> You could just throw it down the center.
[2:13:03] <hkgamingtv> I think you want 96+ power
[2:13:04] <QueequegTheater> @Ether101_Prime doesn't work
[2:13:06] <+xerotwo> N i c e
[2:13:07] <%Theycallmenerf> Use the Spin Johnny Joestar

[2:13:31] <hkgamingtv> you sure it's the light ball?
[2:13:33] <@SoushinSen> This trick sucks
[2:13:33] <Prevot> really doesn't seem THAT great
[2:13:34] <%Noonoox12> does it work with heavier balls?
[2:13:37] <%Juriasu> it's usually better to hit between top pin and one of the two behind it
[2:13:39] <QueequegTheater> @hkgamingtv yes
[2:13:41] <zanzibarian_hamster> Maybe try a heavier ball since woolie is so fast?
[2:13:41] <%Theycallmenerf> Bakana
[2:13:47] <%Holycow8498> He's beginning to believe
[2:13:49] <QueequegTheater> Heavier balls are less accurate
[2:13:49] <%Asuterisuku> You have to play WITH her.
[2:13:52] <%Ether101_Prime> @QueequegTheater You can just roll it down the center.
[2:13:54] <%X2Eliah> Friendship GO DOWN
[2:13:58] <ARDM112> The trick is place it left, aim the most right and then spin all the way left
[2:14:04] <%Ether101_Prime> I think the challange is really now.
[2:14:13] <QueequegTheater> @Ether101_Prime No you can't. I spent like 2 hours trying to do it legit, it literally doesn't work

[2:25:58] <+noajenkk> kiryu is now a grappler @WoolieVersus
[2:26:00] <glaciusinfinite> what did I miss?
[2:26:01] <exnuart> music segment hosts do prerecorded segments typically
[2:26:04] <%Asuterisuku> Horny go up!
[2:26:08] <whiteblacklight74> command grab clothes
[2:26:10] <Carlioo> the heat gauge is rising alright
[2:26:11] <winner_92> man this game's skill tree is so satisfying with the money gauge
[2:26:15] <+noajenkk> some bosses can do it
[2:26:19] <+noajenkk> but pretty much all enemies cant
[2:26:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Bosses can do it
[2:26:23] <TerrifyingRei_05> handy
[2:26:24] <HedgehogGames1> They still can
[2:26:27] <whiteblacklight74> increase your heat gauge with CP
[2:26:28] <%Javaa01> It's way harder to break your grab, like you can still grab late game bosses
[2:26:32] <%kewlmyc> Bosses can, but every one else kinda can't
[2:26:34] <winner_92> most bosses are essentially immune to grabs it seems like
[2:26:35] <andre11dr> Woolie has full heat now too
[2:26:40] <%Asuterisuku> Go eat the rich!
[2:26:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> IT'S TIME
[2:26:43] <Solidnick18> gotta challenge him
[2:26:56] <%big_laser_boss> Blocking enemies can also be dealt with by cancel a guard break by style-changing with the Quick-change clothes
[2:26:57] <%Ether101_Prime> This is something worth waiting for.

It's seriously talk no jutsu in punch form.
[2:42:40] <%X2Eliah> It is called "Brawler" style
[2:42:40] <%gatorafan> OOPS! ALL ALCOHOL
[2:42:41] <majindusto> TIME TO GET DRUNK
[2:42:43] <CureMode_> @WoolieVersus are you going to watch the nintendo direct??
[2:42:44] <$dudedude55555> yakuza games are sponsored by japanese booze
[2:42:45] <%dukenux> Essence of D R U N K
[2:42:45] <OokamiDen02> ESSENCE OF CHUG
[2:42:48] <velgaduere> ESSENCE OF ALCOHOLISM
[2:42:51] <%dukenux> Essence of STOKLASA
[2:42:51] <%jonblnt> Brawlers are powered by booze
[2:42:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Why do you think Bacchus teaches you this style?
[2:42:54] <azurezeroincursio95> ESSENCE OF LIKE A FISH
[2:42:54] <jorniev> THAT'S HOW BRONSON DO
[2:42:58] <downwiththethickness99> Tbf the Brawler trainer is an alcoholic
[2:43:00] <+MrAtheGreat> Kiryu may be radiating the V, but damn is he also radiating the power of ETHANOL
[2:43:06] <candidateplays> TIGER DROP
[2:43:10] <%Holycow8498> TIGER DROP
[2:43:10] <Pyrrhus90> Kiryu has a problem BibleThump
[2:43:14] <Carlioo> tiger drop let's go!
[2:43:17] <OblivionSword1> Ptoto tiger drop
[2:43:17] <Memitim> I mean, bacchus IS the brawler teacher

[2:43:27] <+Hilleltaco> drunkard ENLIGHTENMENT
[2:43:31] <Tuna_Can_0> galaxy drunk
[2:43:36] <Qu1ckyyy> Was Tiger Drop in Yakuza 0?
[2:43:38] <velgaduere> Drunken Master style imminent
[2:43:38] <DSD24> Man has V ascended?
[2:43:43] <%X2Eliah> Sooo if you don't drink, those upgrades are a total waste
[2:43:47] <%Holycow8498> Yes Tiger drop is in 0
[2:43:50] <%Holycow8498> Its called counter hook
[2:43:50] <%dukenux> If you drink 100 shots of vodka, you reach nirvana basicly
[2:43:52] <%notsoy> no, tiger drop was not in 0, unless you count komaki doing it
[2:44:10] <notorious_rng> the brawler move they just looked at is the tiger drop equivalent
[2:44:11] <+Balkespower> HEY BOI
[2:44:12] <+xerotwo> EYY BOI
[2:44:18] <%Javaa01> @notsoy You sorta have Tiger Drop as a secret move, but it's not the killer it is in Kiwami
[2:44:21] <%big_laser_boss> that one training was rough with komeki
[2:44:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this is one is better imo
[2:44:26] <dante_suoh> @Qu1ckyyy only counter hook, but legend style has a counter throw
[2:44:29] <+chiazam> I really LOVE how Kamurocho is basically the same map every game

[3:11:19] <+MrAtheGreat> @SeruraRenge Nah but Woolie's been spanking Shakedown clean
[3:11:20] <Elsewize> It's a metaphorical curbstomp.

[3:11:45] <%Javaa01> Nah fuck the plot, we got upgrades to get
[3:11:49] <%big_laser_boss> @serurarenge though they've yet to abuse it
[3:11:53] <velgaduere> words are hard
[3:11:56] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> There's a few tricks to shit on Shakedown, just chug heat drinks and continually cutscene him to death.
[3:12:05] <+Awkward_Cyborg> Shonen!

[3:12:45] <+Jiggisnipe> yes Woolie

[3:12:46] <%notsoy> you only need 3-4 zap/slime guns to take out shakedown
[3:12:47] <+gutlesscoward> maybe all his value was placed in his real estate?
[3:12:49] <Taclism> D O M I NA T I O N
[3:12:51] <%dukenux> He got Shaked down
[3:12:53] <$dudedude55555> flat out broke
[3:12:53] <brachydios777> You took his revenue
[3:12:56] <%Ether101_Prime> Maybe the money wasn't really his in the first place.
[3:12:59] <OokamiDen02> now he is Salary King
[3:12:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:13:07] <MyNameIsRasus> DOMINATION
[3:13:07] <+MrAtheGreat> Did woolie think that the money he was punching out of people was special effects?
[3:13:09] <+SuperKirby24> kanzenseiha Kappa
[3:13:12] <Spagheddies> You have become the Apex Billionare.
[3:13:15] <%RaziWraith> hoboified the billionaire LUL
[3:13:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> Shakedown! Shakedown!
[3:13:21] <Taclism> You shook him down
[3:13:27] <%Pillagius> Mr. Shakedown came by and shook Leisure King hard :D
[3:13:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> youve become the very shakedown you swore to destroy
[3:13:35] <syanplague> He probally spend it all trying to stop you
[3:13:36] <%big_laser_boss> @woolieversus Remember to re-equip the Quick-change clothes and try style-changing to cancel every finisher attack.
[3:13:37] <Pyrrhus90> you are shakedown now
[3:13:37] <%dukenux> Look at me... I'm Mr. Shakedown now
[3:13:38] <+MrAtheGreat> HAH!
[3:13:44] <+BusterRepukken> big laser boss, dude
[3:13:48] <+BusterRepukken> you got a problem.
[3:13:52] <MyNameIsRasus> You're assuming they can
[3:13:52] <+MrAtheGreat> but shakedown would win tho
[3:13:58] <%the_Punktuation> the_Punktuation subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[3:14:03] <CappuccinoGuil> 300 mil is nothing when you're making 1 billion a minute
[3:14:04] <%dukenux> Like Moby Dick cruising Kamurocho
[3:14:06] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Woolie, Shakedown can 1-shot Kiryu
[3:14:12] <+MordoPrime> dude he is training in space, he is a monster
[3:14:14] <SeruraRenge> the only kings I had to reset on their challenges is the....I can't remmeber their names, the gaming one and the one at the end. Because if you suck at Outrun that's gonna be hard, and that last king is really good at disco
[3:14:27] <Pyrrhus90> he is traning in space, i think he can handle guns LUL
[3:14:29] <CappuccinoGuil> It'll take MORE time to hunt down enough shakedowns to make a billion then it'd take to just do nothing
[3:14:33] <%AmuserName> Capture Shakedown with giant harpoons like Zorah Magdaros. LUL
[3:14:39] <%big_laser_boss> he; people are unenlightened about the Quick-change clothes
[3:14:39] <SeruraRenge> media king, that's the last one
[3:14:40] <+MordoPrime> shakedown its punching asteorids now
[3:14:40] <Taclism> time to make some $
[3:14:42] <+MrAtheGreat> WAGE WAR VIA REAL ESTATE
[3:14:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> imprison shakedown like those guys in demon's souls imprisoned the dragon god
[3:14:48] <%Asuterisuku> The Pleasure King stuff is so good.
[3:14:52] <%big_laser_boss> yes*
[3:15:12] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Tell him about the zap gun V
[3:15:19] <brachydios777> This is where you grind off screen
[3:15:23] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus Once you defeat a king you no longer need security in their region since no one can challenge you there anymore
[3:15:29] <%dukenux> Petty LUL
[3:15:40] <Taclism> its a waste to put him there tho
[3:15:58] <CappuccinoGuil> They are shit, tho
[3:16:02] <+Jiggisnipe> Takeshi Takashita Kappa
[3:16:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Alwyas upgrade tho
[3:16:15] <%big_laser_boss> @serurarenge but you still get back up in random battles
[3:16:25] <+MrAtheGreat> Thanks KK Slider
[3:16:33] <%SouLucha> Shoot, the direct... Guess I'll watch you both.
[3:17:43] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, the Nintendo thing should be going down now huh
[3:17:43] <dukenux> i love how Masochistic Man doesn't even have a name
[3:18:15] <%Javaa01> Not that you can afford it
[3:18:18] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You can rush all 3 if you farm Shakedown
[3:18:18] <@Solidus_113> some places get really expensive
[3:18:19] <thebalticguy1> Not gonna be able to afford that
[3:18:20] <%Javaa01> Cause shit gets REAL expensive
[3:18:23] <SeruraRenge> did they get every property in the leisure king area or did they miss one and that's why they're not at 100?
[3:18:27] <%Ether101_Prime> You could always do the Mr. Shakedown trick.
[3:18:40] <+MrAtheGreat> Prices increase Exponentially, meaning you'll only likely be able to afford one zone at a time
[3:18:43] <%big_laser_boss> they get exponentialy more expensive
[3:18:44] <QueequegTheater> @SeruraRenge Didn't get the friendship places
[3:18:48] <dante_suoh> Has Woolie gotten the Shakedown deep pockets CP Reward?
[3:18:49] <SeruraRenge> oh right
[3:18:49] <+dasmause> @WoolieVersus focusing on one area is safer because you only need one good security to avoid collection problems
[3:18:54] <Prevot> for the people who will remain here during the nintendo direct, don't be yelling about announcements at them
[3:19:04] <%big_laser_boss> @dante_suoh don't know
[3:19:06] <%gatorafan> I'll do like Woolie does and if something good pops up on the direct I'll check the trailer for it later. woolieMIRIN
[3:19:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Plus, you can't upgrade these places until you collect
[3:19:22] <$Spydurman> @WoolieVersus run those props so you can upgrade them next time
[3:19:27] <SeruraRenge> @dasmause Plus the game very clearly wants you to go in the order it's listed because that's basically the order of difficulty
[3:19:27] <+Asuterisuku> Nintendo Direct in five minutes.
[3:19:38] <%Pillagius> wait... Did Woolie get to the "underground fighting" yet?
[3:19:42] <%Asuterisuku> In order of both difficulty and expense.

[3:32:26] <chainsaw105> I dunno turkey is kinda dry to me
[3:32:27] <%BinaryFireball> Turkey is hard to make right
[3:32:30] <OblivionSword1> Japanese eat KFC for Christmas
[3:32:31] <%Asuterisuku> It's great on sandwiches.
[3:32:33] <Afrosamasenpai> If you think turkey's bad you just had bad turkey
[3:32:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Turkey is ok
[3:32:38] <+zepelinnn1> oh i got here at a good time
[3:32:38] <hkgamingtv> Turkey is amazing those three meals out of the year I eat it
[3:32:39] <+Jiggisnipe> yea it's great on sandwiches
[3:32:45] <QueequegTheater> You can also just make turkey sandwiches using pre-sliced
[3:32:52] <SherlockianHero> Poor orphan Kiryu.
[3:32:56] <brokencr0ss> turkey needs gravy
[3:32:57] <digitalslime> turky had a huge botulism outbreak in japan that gave it a bad image.
[3:33:03] <$dudedude55555> turkey sucks, give me eggs
[3:33:07] <heylookitswex> what is everyone's bets on how long this will take?
[3:33:09] <syanplague> they never had a Turkey but KFC Karage fried chinken? Cristmas tradition

[3:37:11] <digitalslime> i blame not being a real yakuza and using keyboard
[3:37:13] <%Asuterisuku> Absolutely worth it.
[3:37:28] <OblivionSword1> 1000% WORTH IT
[3:37:43] <%Halospaz117> BELIEVE IN THE HEART OF THE BALLS
[3:37:49] <%Asuterisuku> Needed some spin.
[3:37:58] <zanzibarian_hamster> Spin is absolutely king
[3:38:02] <OblivionSword1> you gotta believe
[3:38:02] <QueequegTheater> dont fuck up
[3:38:09] <$dudedude55555> NotLikeThis
[3:38:10] <QueequegTheater> It's always way more than you think you need
[3:38:12] <+MrAtheGreat> meh points do matter anyway
[3:38:25] <+MrAtheGreat> dont*
[3:38:27] <%Lightwolfe> flaccid
[3:38:27] <+Balkespower> oh boy
[3:38:29] <+Balkespower> Mario gold
[3:38:33] <+Balkespower> *golf
[3:38:35] <turbofolk> MARIO GOLF?!?!
[3:38:38] <%Asuterisuku> Reminder you can get a Turkey entirely on the last frame.
[3:38:43] <$dudedude55555> OOF
[3:38:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Try aiming for the arrows Woolz if you can't get the timing
[3:39:15] <hkgamingtv> Direct looking pretty weak so far
[3:39:29] <andre11dr> Almost has it
[3:39:29] <+MrAtheGreat> I think the sweet spot is between the middle and the right arrows
[3:39:39] <+Balkespower> SPEED GOLF!
[3:39:46] <hkgamingtv> yeah that happens sometimes
[3:39:48] <putnampuppeteer> welcome to bowling
[3:39:48] <OblivionSword1> That's Bull
[3:39:55] <syanplague> i don´t think that working
[3:39:57] <turbofolk> Only high light was pyra going in but we knew that since '17
[3:39:59] <andre11dr> Fuck that
[3:40:01] <+MrAtheGreat> venom
[3:40:08] <Timarkot> Try venom
[3:40:09] <%Asuterisuku> Too much spin
[3:40:14] <%Asuterisuku> Venom Lord was my favourite.
[3:40:15] <$dudedude55555> heat move the pins
[3:40:18] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The heaviest ball is the pro strat, dat MOMENTUM
[3:40:28] <pi_in_the_sci> green ball best ball
[3:40:31] <%Asuterisuku> RIP Turkey.
[3:40:35] <heylookitswex> You could just manually aim for the sweet spot, that is what I did on my playthrough
[3:40:39] <QueequegTheater> Yeah the ball has to hit just off-center
[3:40:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what's with those last two goons
[3:40:45] <chainsaw105> you don't want to hit it dead on. aim for an angle
[3:40:46] <turbofolk> Wow Mario golf coming back after 15 years
[3:40:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> You kinda want to hit like between the front pin and one of the 2-3 pins.
[3:40:59] <mrblack499> because speed was low
[3:41:02] <GlyphsOffice> More weight = hits the pins better trust me
[3:41:09] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Straight in will leave edges, but if you bound it in a little it sweeps the whole thing.
[3:41:18] <turbofolk> Booo tell tale games
[3:41:19] <$dudedude55555> lmao, telltale
[3:41:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:41:26] <+MrAtheGreat> size dont but power does
[3:41:36] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Heavy ball best ball
[3:41:53] <zanzibarian_hamster> Try a 10-12 lbs ball, it's the sweet spot
[3:41:53] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> God I miss bowling alleys FeelsBadMan
[3:41:59] <hkgamingtv> Direct zzzzzzzz
[3:42:00] <QueequegTheater> The ones I went to you paid per frame
[3:42:10] <+MrAtheGreat> hey stubbs is back i guess
[3:42:17] <$dudedude55555> go 2 balls down
[3:42:17] <andre11dr> Heavy ball can do it as well, but i think it's easier with the light
[3:42:18] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> BIG BALL BOIS
[3:42:22] <QueequegTheater> Maybe try a mid size ball?
[3:42:25] <%Asuterisuku> With more power you need to put in more spin to move it.
[3:42:27] <turbofolk> STUBBS THE ZOMBIE?!?!
[3:42:31] <heylookitswex> Could try a medium ball
[3:42:33] <turbofolk> holy jebus
[3:42:34] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @MrAtheGreat Yessss, I heard about that before, but I'm glad it's happening
[3:42:36] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Stubbs owned
[3:42:42] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Classic OG xbox weird game
[3:42:58] <turbofolk> NO MORE HEROES 3!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:43:01] <turbofolk> OH SHIT
[3:43:03] <%Asuterisuku> OW.
[3:43:04] <QueequegTheater> PogChamp
[3:43:04] <darkfilled> woolie would like the new fist of the north star game if he likes this.
[3:43:06] <OblivionSword1> FOOK
[3:43:10] <LVL1_Scumbag> yozora2Honk
[3:43:11] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @turbofolk We knew it was coming, but I'm glad nonetheless
[3:43:21] <andre11dr> OOF
[3:43:32] <OblivionSword1> Damn you Newtonnnssss
[3:43:45] <+Balkespower> akira slide1
[3:43:47] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @darkfilled I love the RGG Fist of the North Star game a lot, I just hope it comes to PC too, Judgement is coming and the RGG team have been having great success with PC since Y0.
[3:43:48] <$dudedude55555> nice akira slide
[3:44:12] <%Asuterisuku> @NewAndTastySixthHouse The QLOC ports aren't the greatest though.
[3:44:30] <turbofolk> @NewAndTastySixthHouse It was racking up the days of not new footage just like bayo 3
[3:44:33] <+Balkespower> Rocket jumping?
[3:44:39] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Asuterisuku Yeah, but they stopped doing that now I think, 7/LAD is fantastic since they did their own team this time.
[3:44:40] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You don't want to hit the 1 pin head-on, the sweet spot is just to either side of its
[3:44:47] <darkfilled> yeah that's what I meant NewAndTastySixthHouse. sorry.
[3:44:54] <darkfilled> lol
[3:45:05] <%Asuterisuku> @NewAndTastySixthHouse You say that like 3-5 didn't just drop in the state that they did.
[3:45:09] <turbofolk> Neon white will be a niche game no one talks about
[3:45:09] <$dudedude55555> don't aim at the middle
[3:45:11] <OblivionSword1> the 1 pin
[3:45:12] <$dudedude55555> the hell you doing
[3:45:19] <hookhis> this trick doesnt look like a trick at all lol
[3:45:20] <durbotragon> damn
[3:45:20] <MyNameIsRasus> aim for either side of the 1 pin
[3:45:20] <+MrAtheGreat> Again, Venom lord, far right, max spin left iirc
[3:45:24] <QueequegTheater> 1 spin is almost nothing
[3:45:31] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Asuterisuku They've been fine for me, all I've seen is the griping about bits and bobs, so dunno.
[3:45:32] <+MrAtheGreat> It's way easier
[3:45:36] <+Balkespower> Nice
[3:45:37] <heylookitswex> this is going to take a while, isn't it
[3:45:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's the pocket

[3:47:06] <TheRealTuschi> literally did this an hour ago. using the six ball i step twice to the right, aimed straight, while adjusting one to the left. got 4 in a row
[3:47:06] <+Balkespower> nice

[3:59:40] <lotharrio> He's just a young boy, leave him alone!
[3:59:57] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Kiryu is just a Ken doll underneath, he's already the ultimate lifeform, SEX: USELESS

[4:01:12] <+Balkespower> Ninja gaiden collection for switch
[4:01:15] <turbofolk> Hey ninja gaiden compilation
[4:01:18] <+Balkespower> WHY IS THAT NOT ON PC?!

[4:02:10] <+MrAtheGreat> EIII HYRULE WARRIORS DLC
[4:02:10] <darkfilled> i like ninja gaiden 2. more weapons more fun.
[4:02:15] <+Balkespower> eyy
[4:02:38] <+Balkespower> LUL
[4:02:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[4:02:50] <+MrAtheGreat> still no linkle tho I guess
[4:02:55] <HedgehogGames1> Look at that suit
[4:03:11] <DatAsuna> Except even nishiki laughed at him
[4:03:11] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The suit is connected to Nishiki, that's why he carries the burden of that shirt.
[4:03:16] <$dudedude55555> switch is looking good
[4:03:18] <+MrAtheGreat> worth
[4:03:33] <+MrAtheGreat> need to spend it for better rewards tho
[4:03:33] <PsychedelicSnake> Use your CP to decorate the office
[4:03:34] <digitalslime> you may have one
[4:03:35] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You need to use CP to get Limit Breaks
[4:03:38] <DeadlyWest> what I actually like, with his suits in 0 is that he wears a black suit when a lowly Yakuza and a white suit when working a "normal job"
[4:03:38] <hkgamingtv> @dudedude55555 not really imo
[4:03:39] <+Balkespower> GHOST AND GOBLINS!
[4:03:49] <DeadlyWest> and then goes to a grey suit later
[4:03:51] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie can't afford to waste cp after giving one to that one kid Kappa
[4:03:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh that looks nice
[4:03:56] <DeadlyWest> like that's really neat colour theory
[4:04:06] <$dudedude55555> @hkgamingtv triangle tactics looks great
[4:04:07] <QueequegTheater> Green is by far the best one
[4:04:21] <DeadlyWest> I like Urban, personally
[4:04:25] <+Balkespower> it makes a great contrast with the chairs
[4:04:30] <carlosmiyamoto> I like the hardwood floor
[4:04:34] <digitalslime> that was a late night bar look
[4:04:38] <CappuccinoGuil> There's too much red furniture for a red wall
[4:04:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> We need like one of those high gloss power broker ice offices
[4:04:52] <+MrAtheGreat> Apex for stwitch too... for some reaosn.
[4:05:05] <$dudedude55555> plot is a far away dream now
[4:05:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> just buy SEGA lol
[4:05:28] <hkgamingtv> Direct is a 2D Jrpg fest

[4:06:00] <BlackermanZX> The news for zelda is that theres no news
[4:06:00] <+MrAtheGreat> Skyward Sword confirmed for switch
[4:06:05] <Timarkot> Oh god majima grind will be worse
[4:06:06] <lotharrio> Well they still wear pants. Just no panties underneath.
[4:06:11] <$dudedude55555> skyward sword NotLikeThis
[4:06:12] <%shmupdogjoe> I mean, personally I prefer my steaks without panties on them
[4:06:16] <+Balkespower> Why even tell that you have no news?!
[4:06:19] <%shmupdogjoe> it's more practical
[4:06:21] <putnampuppeteer> "I'm just saying there's no panties in the sauce"
[4:06:21] <+Balkespower> whta the hell?
[4:06:21] <Kirby_Sauce> no excuses woolie
[4:06:31] <Kirby_Sauce> skyward SWORD
[4:06:33] <CappuccinoGuil> No Panties BBQ has the meanest steak in town, man
[4:06:35] <+Balkespower> I am no Zelda fan but I know that would rub the wrong way
[4:06:37] <turbofolk> Skywartd sword no more wii motion deition?
[4:06:39] <andre11dr> Skyward Sword are ya shiting me LUL
[4:06:40] <GlyphsOffice> you should buy Jones BBQ and foot massage
[4:06:42] <%Chatterbox1991> Cross Tekken?
[4:06:42] <arielanarchy92> Trios in Apex. Him on switch, my other bro on his Xbox and me on my ps4!
[4:06:56] <+Jiggisnipe> lol
[4:07:03] <Timarkot> thank you V
[4:07:16] <NorthGrizzly> Just tell Woolie what games to pratice
[4:07:29] <andre11dr> God this direct seems to suck
[4:07:32] <+MrAtheGreat> Skyward sword motion controls ew
[4:07:40] <NorthGrizzly> Outrun, and Telephone
[4:07:45] <hkgamingtv> KONAMIN LAND
[4:07:53] <NorthGrizzly> Outrun was a nightmare for me
[4:07:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Skyward Sword with button controls YAY
[4:08:06] <+Balkespower> nintendo can't stop trying to add their motion control gimmick
[4:08:07] <$dudedude55555> finally
[4:08:10] <DeadlyWest> is there even a "normal" way to find the buildings you buy? Or is it literally just hug the walls or use a guide?
[4:08:18] <$dudedude55555> just hug the walls
[4:08:24] <+MrAtheGreat> Oh fuvk it's right stick sword swings like that norse game
[4:08:26] <$dudedude55555> and then look up the guide LUL
[4:08:27] <+Balkespower> @DeadlyWest Hug the wall like Doomguy or a guide
[4:08:33] <carlosmiyamoto> Hall wuggin or guides
[4:08:39] <CappuccinoGuil> @DeadlyWest there is a list on the Business menu, but mostly you just wanna Hall Wug it
[4:08:48] <$dudedude55555> the list is pretty useless
[4:08:51] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 skyward sword woolie. ON SWITCH. now you have to get in
[4:08:53] <%big_laser_boss> use the Quick-change clothes
[4:08:56] <DeadlyWest> @CappuccinoGuil Ye I know that, I more meant in terms of locations specifically
[4:09:25] <DatAsuna> yeah yakuza is kinda lacking in OTGs
[4:09:39] <DatAsuna> Well a lot of games with knockdowns have really limited options to exploit it
[4:09:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:09:40] <$dudedude55555> next chapter is majima again
[4:09:58] <DatAsuna> Nioh has some GOD TIER OTGs tho
[4:10:01] <CappuccinoGuil> @DeadlyWest nope, if you follow the world's hints, you can kinda find it (like the stores all have signs) but it's too much of a hassle. They added in map markers in later games.
[4:10:30] <CappuccinoGuil> I'll pay 100 dollars to fuck off
[4:10:36] <andre11dr> I love how Kiryu owns a part of town,still lives in a shithole
[4:10:38] <+Balkespower> SPLATOON?!
[4:10:40] <+Jiggisnipe> they pick up the money and they still try and fight you Kappa
[4:10:47] <turbofolk> Oh splatoon shit boooo
[4:10:51] <$dudedude55555> splatoon 3?
[4:11:03] <DeadlyWest> given it's 10k Yen, so roughly $1000, that's a fair amount of money
[4:11:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 20 bucks is twenty bucks
[4:11:05] <+Tucker0603> do it
[4:11:10] <%AmuserName> LOCKED IN
[4:11:10] <GhostRavens> do it
[4:11:12] <OblivionSword1> I don't remember
[4:11:12] <fIashman92> More sidequests pls
[4:11:17] <Timarkot> Do it
[4:11:17] <GhostRavens> lock it in boys
[4:11:18] <CappuccinoGuil> How locked in, though?
[4:11:18] <syanplague> locked in
[4:11:21] <Alejandroxciv> big part come in
[4:11:22] <+Balkespower> The tower
[4:11:23] <%notsoy> you are locked in to the end of the chapter
[4:11:23] <andre11dr> I don't remember
[4:11:25] <%Jetzord> I'd say lock it in
[4:11:28] <%AmuserName> NO BREAKS FOR ~1 - 1.5 HRS
[4:11:28] <CappuccinoGuil> POCKET RACER
[4:11:29] <Wolfdoctor80> locked in
[4:11:29] <%big_laser_boss> learn to use the Quick-change clothes
[4:11:32] <$dudedude55555> why? just do real estate next time
[4:11:34] <%Jetzord> Real Estate takes a long time
[4:11:42] <+Balkespower> ^
[4:11:42] <DeadlyWest> it's not ABSOLUTE point of no return but it'll take a while to get back to normal free roam
[4:11:45] <GhostRavens> you're locked in for the rest of the chapter.
[4:11:45] <CappuccinoGuil> Real State and Pocket Racer stream let's gooooooo
[4:11:51] <$dudedude55555> real estate takes HOURS
[4:11:51] <pi_in_the_sci> you're locked if you sleep
[4:11:56] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Majima's is way more fun too though
[4:11:57] <%big_laser_boss> encounter finder can be collected
[4:11:59] <+Tucker0603> locked in I think but real estate takes a long while
[4:11:59] <syanplague> if you want to build real state you should not go in
[4:12:03] <HedgehogGames1> It takes a while to get back.
[4:12:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> theres plenty of substories
[4:12:08] <chainsaw105> and Majima's thing is better! fight me V!
[4:12:08] <%Jetzord> I spent an entire DAY doing Real Estate to max it
[4:12:09] <NorthGrizzly> You are LOCVKED IN
[4:12:12] <$dudedude55555> time for cat fights
[4:12:26] <DeadlyWest> I don't really agree, Majima's stuff I found way quicker
[4:12:31] <brokencr0ss> Majima's thing is great
[4:12:31] <+Balkespower> SPLATOON 3
[4:12:33] <turbofolk> O striaght splatoon 3
[4:12:37] <+Jiggisnipe> also it's almost 6 pm anyway
[4:12:40] <$dudedude55555> @DeadlyWest both take ages, but majima is more fun
[4:12:41] <NorthGrizzly> Majima stuff is more fun
[4:12:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> SPLAT BOIS
[4:12:52] <OblivionSword1> Shakedown Shakedown
[4:13:03] <%big_laser_boss> you can get the encounter finder now
[4:13:04] <turbofolk> And its the same game, i was wiating for slaptoonn cyberpunk open world rpg
[4:13:13] <NorthGrizzly> It is a actual game
[4:13:17] <+Balkespower> 2022 LUL
[4:13:28] <Edjager97> I like how V Is still wearing the suit after all these weeks
[4:13:29] <CappuccinoGuil> I know you're here Shakedown, you big fucking nerd. Where's my goddamn money?
[4:13:29] <syanplague> if you want shakedown you could try to get the encounter finder
[4:13:32] <%big_laser_boss> cancel attacks with the Quick-change clothes against Shakedown
[4:13:33] <DeadlyWest> @dudedude55555 Majima's does take a while, but the actual activity is way shorter. Kiryu's usually takes 5 minutes even with max business upgrade. Majima's is always 3 minutes
[4:14:07] <+Balkespower> NO SMTV :(
[4:14:09] <%big_laser_boss> mushroom guy
[4:14:10] <$dudedude55555> @DeadlyWest and you have to do the dates, tho
[4:14:12] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Doesn't his big marker show up on your map?
[4:14:21] <@Menitta> ok back to the important shit
[4:14:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @KaiserMario no enemy finder yet
[4:14:29] <hkgamingtv> Direct was a bust
[4:14:33] <turbofolk> thats it No BAYO OR SMTV AGAIN
[4:14:33] <DeadlyWest> @dudedude55555 you don't have to. It's just nice to do for leveling up
[4:14:38] <OblivionSword1> just in 0
[4:14:38] <$dudedude55555> shakedown is 0 only
[4:14:39] <DatAsuna> Just this
[4:14:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Shakedown's just in Y0
[4:14:42] <%Holycow8498> Just 0
[4:14:42] <jorniev> splatoon 3
[4:14:43] <andre11dr> Just 0
[4:14:43] <%big_laser_boss> does no one else know about mushroom seller?
[4:14:45] <%Jetzord> @dudedude55555 at leas the dates are better than trying the telephone club
[4:14:45] <+Awkward_Cyborg> Direct kinda sucked....
[4:14:48] <syanplague> @KaiserMario he need encounter finder
[4:14:49] <+Balkespower> Only in Zero
[4:14:49] <BlackermanZX> No F Zero again doodSad
[4:14:52] <%Javaa01> Shakedown is an active threat in this game only
[4:14:52] <hkgamingtv> @turbofolk No Metroid No BoTW
[4:14:56] <@Menitta> Nah there's nothing like Shakedown in anything else
[4:14:57] <$dudedude55555> I liked the direct
[4:14:58] <OblivionSword1> Kiwami 1 has something similar
[4:14:58] <%Javaa01> But there are other roaming bosses
[4:15:01] <lotharrio> Not really in 7. There's different rare encounters though.
[4:15:09] <SeruraRenge> money isn't a focus in any of the other games so yeah
[4:15:10] <+Balkespower> @BlackermanZX I feel ya, kyodai.
[4:15:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Just 0. 5 and 6 have a few roaming enemies but it’s not nearly as in depth or cool
[4:15:14] <fIashman92> Maybe Shakedown is in the pock circuit arena
[4:15:15] <DeadlyWest> Just 0, Shakedown has a single mention in a Kiwami 1 substory though
[4:15:18] <+Jiggisnipe> you guys always set yourselves up for disappointment by having expectations
[4:15:19] <turbofolk> Highlight was the pyra announcemet, No more heroes 3 and the ninja gaiden collecrtion\
[4:15:23] <andre11dr> 1 K does have the Majima everywhere system tho
[4:15:28] <@Menitta> Judgment has something kinda like Shakedown but its not roaming
[4:15:32] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Samurai Warriors 5 alone made me happy as hell
[4:15:33] <SeruraRenge> I switched away from this stream to see the Direct. I kinda wish I didn't
[4:15:36] <hkgamingtv> No shade on jrpgs but you gotta have something beside that
[4:15:46] <DeadlyWest> I will say I found it's very common for Shakedown to be in the Champion District too, which would be a pain in the ass
[4:15:49] <chainsaw105> are we not able to get the encounter finder now? I swear we are but I may be wrong
[4:16:00] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s hiding from us
[4:16:09] <+Jiggisnipe> Shakedown is afraid of you
[4:16:09] <$dudedude55555> I'm fine with JRPG, and there's NMH3 as well as Splatoon 3
[4:16:11] <%big_laser_boss> learn the Quick-change clothes against him
[4:16:12] <Timarkot> champion district
[4:16:12] <%FirebirdXR> THE ENCOUNTER FINDER IS IN THE MUSCLE SIDE QUEST
[4:16:14] <%nintega010> Back from the direct
[4:16:15] <%doomerskeletor13> There will always be a Shakedown on the map
[4:16:15] <DeadlyWest> He COULD be in a park
[4:16:23] <%FirebirdXR> *miracle
[4:16:24] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I ended up finding Shakedown up north near the darts bar a lot
[4:16:35] <glaciusinfinite> Direct live chat was a trainwreck and I loved every second of it
[4:16:39] <%The_Timo> Disappointing fucking nintendo Direct.... should have never left, Sorry Woolz
[4:16:41] <DeadlyWest> yeah, check the three parks first

[4:17:09] <%big_laser_boss> you can get the encounter finder

[4:17:15] <fIashman92> steal money, invest, then fight
[4:17:20] <andre11dr> So no SMT 5 Damn
[4:17:20] <DeadlyWest> you can even save when he's in free roam
[4:17:24] <$dudedude55555> you can still steal and then advance

[4:22:16] <lotharrio> Woolie vs God continues.
[4:22:25] <TTouchdown> Aaaand this is why I don’t play on pc for console games

[4:22:42] <hkgamingtv> lol Direct was meh
[4:22:44] <+Ashaea> QA STAND
[4:22:44] <%Halospaz117> I can't believe Nintendo corrupted Woolie's save
[4:22:46] <RyuShinden> Eh....Just play GG LUL
[4:22:47] <SeruraRenge> No better idea, DON'T watch that Nintendo Direct, you'll just feel even shittier
[4:22:49] <DeadlyWest> ye, all you did was look for Shakedown right?
[4:22:51] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Direct was cool
[4:22:52] <Basic_Birch_> Yo Nintendo Direct sucked
[4:22:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Daisuke ends the Yakuza stream LIVE
[4:22:55] <HedgehogGames1> Nothing to watch in Direct.
[4:22:55] <%big_laser_boss> practice the Quick-change clothes off screen
[4:22:55] <andre11dr> Direct sucked
[4:22:59] <%Javaa01> 50 minutes of direct, 35 minutes of filler
[4:23:02] <%gatorafan> On a second thought, lets not watch the Nintendo Direct. Tis a silly place.
[4:23:09] <+Jiggisnipe> you guys talking about the direct reminds me of the game awards LUL
[4:23:11] <$dudedude55555> Direct was fine
[4:23:16] <+Take_2_shots> The only thing worth knowing from the Direct was Splatoon 3 is coming... eventually
[4:23:19] <hkgamingtv> Direct was weak
[4:23:34] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> NMH3, Splat3, SW5, Stubbs etc. shit makes me happy
[4:23:52] <restingbones> @Take_2_shots I for one am really happy to finally see a hard confirm that we WILL actually get a Splatoon 3 :) And that it looks super cool!
[4:23:52] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:23:52] <hkgamingtv> KINGPIN

[4:24:11] <%Invlux> I never got to play Skyward Sword, didn't have a Wii Motion +
[4:24:13] <%gatorafan> Remember to spin it.
[4:24:21] <%Jetzord> Nintendo was ahead of the game with Wii Sports
[4:24:24] <hkgamingtv> Jeffery Lebowski
[4:24:35] <SeruraRenge> If you just use the slime gun then it doesn't matter
[4:24:38] <%samazonsky> ... No, I'm not-
[4:24:41] <DeadlyWest> yeah, main streets in the North are by far the best
[4:24:56] <DeadlyWest> nah, the worst area is by far the Champion District where it's RIDICULOUSLY narrow
[4:24:56] <$dudedude55555> ZAP GAN
[4:24:58] <hkgamingtv> Yakuza Lesson, save OFTEN
[4:24:58] <heylookitswex> Fighting them in the Champion District is impossible
[4:25:00] <+Carquar> I never considered using a gun on him. What the hell lol
[4:25:02] <%big_laser_boss> doesn't matter with the Quick-change clothes on
[4:25:02] <$dudedude55555> ZAP NOT SLIME
[4:25:02] <DeadlyWest> and he was there a lot in my experience
[4:25:05] <andre11dr> Just open fire and he's probably mostly dead
[4:25:07] <smallheals> woolies steam ending ?
[4:25:15] <hkgamingtv> NUGGZ!!
[4:25:18] <%FirebirdXR> Reminder; the sub quest with the ENCOUNTER FINDER is avaliable I believe. GlitchLit
[4:25:20] <SeruraRenge> @Carquar Slime Gun completely melts his hp no matter how high it gets

[4:26:04] <%samazonsky> .. Wait
[4:26:05] <%Asuterisuku> The Joycons are a good analogue for the Wii remotes.

[4:26:17] <%VillainsNeverSleep> VillainsNeverSleep subscribed at Tier 1.
[4:26:18] <SeruraRenge> And pat was right all these years, you could play it with regular controls and not motion
[4:26:20] <+Balkespower> Hey Woolie, did you like the Ace Combat Soundtrack? Did you think about trying it out at some point?
[4:26:22] <%Invlux> Where's SMT, Nintendo? WHERE
[4:26:24] <%samazonsky> Nugget... Financial advisor...
[4:26:24] <%Afterman_> looks like the recast Henry for NMH3 since Flynn is a sex pest

[4:26:26] <%Chatterbox1991> YEAH BUT THR STAR CHILD MENITTA
[4:26:31] <DatAsuna> "you're supposed to think this" is the worst way to go into a thing
[4:26:31] <+FingaLights> Has real controls now
[4:26:31] <BlackermanZX> Skyward Sword with both joycon and normal controls
[4:26:33] <%big_laser_boss> final boss is really cool
[4:26:46] <DeadlyWest> yeah, that glitch is really rare
[4:26:52] <inkandamber> That was rough dude...

[4:27:03] <syanplague> you can take the man out of the QE but you can´t get the QE out of the man

[4:30:07] <@Solidus_113> Shantae didn't get in either, or the Skullgirls character, or the last 2 of the regular game roster
[4:30:09] <andre11dr> To bad Mike Z turned out to be evil
[4:30:18] <DatAsuna> It's a big game
[4:30:21] <dandragon01> Are we ending yakuza 0 early
[4:30:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's almost like dropping a fighting game for a long time
[4:30:32] <michaelpleasefortheloveof> nioh?
[4:30:33] <andre11dr> !uptime
[4:30:33] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 46 minutes
[4:30:35] <%SouLucha> I dropped Nioh, uh-oh...
[4:30:40] <DatAsuna> And every input has multiple options
[4:30:53] <andre11dr> I totally dropped Nioh 2
[4:30:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1361563826160861186?s=20
[4:30:59] <SmartAssPawn089> I eat that gameplay up, delicious. Level design not so much.
[4:31:01] <SeruraRenge> Onmyo is just japanese fortune telling
[4:31:01] <%samazonsky> Must not be the chosen one this time around.
[4:31:14] <DatAsuna> I do wish they didn't cut onmyo in half
[4:31:39] <%samazonsky> I'm not STOPPING you, sir.
[4:31:58] <therealtacopancakes> nioh 2 playthrough when?
[4:32:13] <%Asuterisuku> Pat was talking to this with him on the podcast.
[4:32:20] <benupde287> play it baby
[4:32:24] <%samazonsky> All of these voices.. Damn.
[4:32:33] <therealtacopancakes> <3
[4:32:37] <%ZweihanderSteve> yo these people still asking for a nioh playthrough??
[4:32:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> maybe even string reggie along for maximum ptsd
[4:32:41] <jorniev> nah man
[4:32:46] <GhostRavens> you still planning on lping disco elysium once the final cut comes out?
[4:32:53] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe after Yakuza 0
[4:32:59] <%SouLucha> Just Pat grind off-screen
[4:33:03] <%Jetzord> nah, we just finished a long one and Yakuza is another long one
[4:33:06] <SeruraRenge> 2 is a prequel but it wants you to know about stuff William does in 1 because it's relevant near the end when the dates start lining up
[4:33:08] <andre11dr> Sadly by the time i finished Nioh 1 and ALL the DLC i kinda had more than enough of Nioh and then Nioh 2 came out and it was better but i just didn't want even more of that
[4:33:10] <%Asuterisuku> I'm not sure about doing Nioh while Reggie's doing Demon's Souls.
