[0:23:21] <%kullumanati> Woolievs main chick is fighting games of course crumbs don‚Äôt matter. Too bad

[0:24:09] <andre11dr> Woolie i hate this
[0:24:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo we getting part 9 this year
[0:24:17] <Reesemonster23> all bioshock games are really good I hope the new one that is planned is good.
[0:24:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:24:28] <%Seancicle> moi aussi woolieFUN
[0:24:31] <+zanz_san> I have 1500 hours in mhw but I rarely used the event armor.  I killed extreme behemoth 50+ times
[0:24:49] <%holydeviant1> Two drills!
[0:24:54] <Belakitu> BIGGER Drill
[0:24:56] <andre11dr> Like why not just play a caracter action game at that point
[0:25:18] <%Prevot> both
[0:25:20] <JetpackMcQuack> The bioshock name
[0:25:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh yeah the story and gameplay are annoying
[0:25:21] <%holydeviant1> Woolie would play Prey and just go unga wrench build and that's okay
[0:25:22] <Reesemonster23> mitten squad actually beat bioshock 2 with just the drill
[0:25:47] <Afrosamasenpai> someone didnt play the dlc
[0:26:01] <%Seancicle> üà∑Ô∏èüàÅÔ∏è
[0:26:02] <Belakitu> But how play Thief tho?
[0:26:03] <+BananaSlammuh> Bioshock 2 had the best gameplay. Infinite was pretty neat tho.
[0:26:31] <andre11dr> That's like playing Bloodborne and being like 'No i like shooters so i refuse to use melee weapons"
[0:26:39] <@Menitta> Bioshock 2 is cool.  playing as a big daddy
[0:26:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> big daddy with big drill
[0:26:58] <%dds333a> that shit is on Amazon, which threw me
[0:27:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> they were bad
[0:27:08] <%holydeviant1> Rebuilds were good
[0:27:20] <%dds333a> they are, but if you want 3 0 you should do 1 0 and 2 0
[0:27:29] <@Menitta> I dont like the first rebuild since it's not paced for a movie
[0:27:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> the rebuilds are varying in quality
[0:27:45] <+zanz_san> It's Anno's Turn A Gundam
[0:27:46] <+BananaSlammuh> Rebuilds we‚Äôre rough but now they are great. The final movie is aces
[0:28:13] <leith_aziz> Hello
[0:28:16] <@Menitta> you can skip the first rebuild tbh
[0:28:20] <%Seancicle> ÁßÅ‰∫Ä„ÅÆÂ≠¶Áîü
[0:28:20] <+zanz_san> Anno's wife really helped him out
[0:28:20] <andre11dr> I saw them, didn't care much about them but i don't care about Eva that hard anyway
[0:28:22] <%dds333a> it has some things, yeah
[0:28:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> SKIP THE FIRST one please
[0:28:28] <leith_aziz> Any topics I missed?
[0:28:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> that one is legit bad
[0:28:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> not really
[0:28:49] <%dds333a> however, if one has seen Death and rebirth, then maybe some stuff already rehashed
[0:28:52] <+Hollow_Mirage> Best Shinji is the SRW one where he gets Bright Slapped and becomes a chad
[0:29:13] <dds333a> has reg read the manga? Kappa
[0:29:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't remember anything of value you NEED to see in the first one
[0:29:18] <%RyTYoung> Wait are we talking about Eva as a whole or just the rebuilds?
[0:29:20] <@Menitta> I dont think so? I just remember rebuild 1 being a recap of the first few episodes
[0:29:27] <@Menitta> I saw it recently too
[0:29:33] <sendart> the first one is more remake but the rest go crazy
[0:29:34] <%holydeviant1> Rebuild is Anno coming back to the series without horrible depression
[0:29:34] <%dds333a> @rytyoung just Rebuild
[0:29:35] <+zanz_san> It's basically the manga ending
[0:29:37] <andre11dr> Just keep in mind that the guy making ir hates the series and you
[0:29:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> the first rebuild wasn't anything new that mattered
[0:29:58] <+BananaSlammuh> I think the first one had a couple teases (think the moon scenes) but nothing too different and it‚Äôs covered in the second one
[0:30:00] <%dds333a> I'd say Remake is MORE distinct than 1.0
[0:30:02] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:30:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> the second one is where you can start and miss nothing
[0:30:14] <@Menitta> lol
[0:30:20] <%RyTYoung> @dds333a ahh tyty
[0:30:38] <%dds333a> np
[0:30:53] <%asakura_ayase> Eva is a series I don‚Äôt really like, but I appreciate its existence
[0:31:08] <%dds333a> huh
[0:31:13] <andre11dr> That's me ,i didn't care
[0:31:13] <mrblitzstream> time for a Eva Movie Binge
[0:31:28] <%RyTYoung> I've been trying to get my best friend to either watch JoJo's or Eva, and he hasn't started either NotLikeThis
[0:31:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:29] <@Menitta> Idk how I feel about Eva. I watched all of it a year ago
[0:31:36] <@Menitta> its neat
[0:31:38] <%RyTYoung> I watched Jujitsu Kaisen for them NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:31:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> i prefer the manga
[0:31:57] <%dds333a> @rytyoung fuck LUL
[0:31:58] <@Menitta> not mind blowing or best anime of all time like its built up to be
[0:32:03] <andre11dr> I don't think Eva is tash but so many people have been overeating it so hard that i kinda find it disappointing
[0:32:08] <leith_aziz> @RyTYoung JoJo fan here. Getting into JoJO takes time, but I'm glad I got into it
[0:32:14] <leith_aziz> *JoJo

[0:32:37] <%dds333a> based
[0:32:43] <+zanz_san> I'm glad that Anno finished Eva to finally make Shin Ultraman.  Tsubaraiya Pro have been on ball lately
[0:32:58] <%RyTYoung> @leith_aziz ngl it did take me some time to get through the first part, but after that I was sold
[0:33:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:33:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> those days are rough
[0:33:18] <andre11dr> That was today
[0:33:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Dat be Sleep yo
[0:33:24] <%dds333a> thankfully, I always know why. the issue is fixing it TearGlove
[0:33:28] <@Menitta> that was yesterday for me
[0:33:28] <andre11dr> Butci knew why tho
[0:33:29] <leith_aziz> Here's the thing, I know almost nothing of Evangelion. If some people really like it and like to share to others they're thought on it, that seems fine
[0:33:37] <%RyTYoung> omg I'm sorry to hear BibleThump
[0:33:42] <Balcazaurus> "Obsess over the problem until it doesn't exist anymore." That's real, Woolie.
[0:33:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Sorry for your loss
[0:33:54] <leith_aziz> huh? I didnt hear the comment. But im sorry for whatever happened
[0:34:00] <%dds333a> ouch
[0:34:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> why would you only demon flip at me
[0:34:09] <mrblitzstream> ooofff

[0:34:11] <Reesemonster23> that sounds like sf5 to me lmao LUL
[0:34:12] <+zanz_san> horrible
[0:34:16] <@Menitta> Akuma keeps you humble
[0:34:23] <leith_aziz> Is Akuma like the Chipp of SF?
[0:34:31] <andre11dr> That's all games tho
[0:34:33] <%dds333a> what ELSE did he do tho, seriously cmonBruh
[0:34:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> I PLAY ABIGIAL, WHY YOU FLIPPING AT ME
[0:34:41] <Pookiedaexzile> The Hardcorest
[0:34:43] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz depending on the game. worse
[0:34:46] <JetpackMcQuack> the angry
[0:34:46] <%asakura_ayase> The grime
[0:34:53] <%holydeviant1> It's like making Scumble, from discworld, though no one will get that one
[0:34:54] <Pookiedaexzile> The Streets
[0:34:54] <hologram_sam> Cream of the Crop & the Sour Milk
[0:34:55] <leith_aziz> @dds333a I played Tekken 7.
[0:35:01] <%dds333a> akuma is well documented as the shoto that has everything
[0:35:04] <mrblitzstream> The Purest Toxic CORE
[0:35:06] <andre11dr> @captainpiledriver See now you deserve the toxicity
[0:35:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Da Streets
[0:35:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> i didn't lose any games, it's just like, really, you only gonna flip at me
[0:35:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's dickheads
[0:35:36] <leith_aziz> I think the most toxic in Guilty Gear I've found was a Slayer spamming teleport and 6P in Rev 2, and a really good Nago taunting once
[0:35:36] <andre11dr> Abigail players deserve no better
[0:35:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> abigail players deserve love
[0:35:47] <leith_aziz> Other than that, the community is usually pretty nice
[0:35:54] <kungfu_kaio> Hey Woolie, love your youtube channel. What are your top 5 favorite shonen?
[0:36:05] <+wumpy3d> woiah an ad

[0:38:13] <andre11dr> LOOKING YOU guy that tried to run away with my PC
[0:38:21] <@Menitta> What is nice is that, at least in the states, the FedEx shipment requires signature
[0:38:32] <%TubeMan642> you can buy a doorbell cam for like $40
[0:38:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:38:34] <%dds333a> RINGU will take care of it
[0:38:34] <andre11dr> Literally chased him down the street
[0:38:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> who was the delivery company, cause i've had my local USPS sign for packages for me and just not attempt to deliver
[0:38:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> and i was pissed they signed my name so they didn't have to walk to the door
[0:39:00] <kungfu_kaio> Woolie, do you like Dragon Ball? What is your favorite saga?
[0:39:05] <@Menitta> god now I'm scared lmao. that problem never occurred to me
[0:39:06] <+zanz_san> My dad was doing yard work and he caught a porch pirate trying to steal our neighbors package and he shamed him to put it back.
[0:39:18] <Balcazaurus> Oh my

[1:46:11] <+FataltheBaptist> cant wait to deep dive
[1:46:44] <%pupil31> Is Woolie planning to play the second game also?
[1:46:57] <+FataltheBaptist> does woolie look at the stats, aesthetics or other factors when choosing his demons
[1:47:15] <%dds333a> @pupil31 he's never mentioned it thus far, it's up to him, I guess
[1:47:22] <+FataltheBaptist> there is a 2nd raidou game?
[1:47:48] <%dds333a> @fatalthebaptist by what he's said previously, aesthetics do play a factor

[1:51:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:51:29] <+FataltheBaptist> rick moranis quote
[1:51:36] <%dds333a> @fatalthebaptist makes sense, although grinding isn't exactly required in this game. it's also remarkably easy to keep demons well past the point of their "usefulness" in this game than in other smt games
[1:52:12] <+zanz_san> it's so fucked down here in Tampa/St. Pete
[1:52:23] <+FataltheBaptist> oooh snake lady from Hercules the legendary journeys

[2:00:27] <%codymagpie> oof
[2:00:27] <%meniscate> I wonder what's Dark Montreal like?
[2:00:55] <TheHeroAppears> he seems useless against them
[2:01:49] <andre11dr> Yeah Woolie use the demon weak again wind against the birds
[2:02:08] <+FataltheBaptist> arent the birds weak to lightning though
[2:02:08] <%meniscate> Most of the elemental weaknesses carry over from game to game. You can also usually just look at a demon and tell what they're weak to. it's on fire? Then it must be weak to ice. It can fly? Then Zio.
[2:02:29] <%dds333a> @andre11dr the classic, this demons has the skill I need, but he's also weak to what I want to avoid LUL
[2:02:58] <%dds333a> @meniscate also, birds often and up being weak to gun in the games that have them
[2:02:58] <+FataltheBaptist> what is that weird Tulpa doll running behind raidou

[2:10:57] <%dds333a> @fatalthebaptist Jubokko is a Debisama design, that has appeared a few times here and there. Oboroguruma is a classic demon designed after SMT 1's Chris the Car (which itself is a reference to Christine), but this devising is made for this game

[2:13:40] <%dds333a> it's similar to the Wanyudo, which is a living wagon wheel
[2:13:50] <OblivionSword1> probably because the japanese word for car is similar sounding to guruma

[2:23:08] <mrblitzstream> constipated demon LUL
[2:23:09] <%dds333a> @chief_chongo laziness, even at the cost of self-interest
[2:23:11] <Qu1ckyyy> Terminator is by far the best demon
[2:23:15] <andre11dr> @chief_chongo That's how his actually depicted irl
[2:23:22] <%dds333a> @qu1ckyyy you know it
[2:23:24] <dinnydanny777> Shape of waters limesO
[2:23:24] <+chief_chongo> so hes too lazy to wipe and get up
[2:23:40] <+chief_chongo> I'm pretty sure medieval depictions of belphegor dont have the toilet lol
[2:23:40] <%dds333a> @chief_chongo exactly LUL
[2:23:55] <andre11dr> @chief_chongo Yeah it's supposed to represent laziness
[2:24:18] <+chief_chongo> hes on a chair, close enough

[2:24:46] <andre11dr> Close enough
[2:24:55] <+chief_chongo> you wacky belphegor
[2:25:32] <andre11dr> Bephegor at least makes sense when you look at him
[2:25:42] <andre11dr> As opposed to Bael
[2:25:47] <%dds333a> @chief_chongo that wacky, wacky Solomon summoning them demons NotLikeThis

[2:27:10] <+chief_chongo> yeah says belphegor is the chief demon in the domain of sloth. feels kinda underused as a tutorial miniboss in p5
[2:27:44] <andre11dr> He's a sidequest in Radiou 2
[2:27:46] <civilized_worm12> going deep Kreygasm
[2:27:58] <+vaderxyz1970> This feels like woolie and reggie going to the grocery store
[2:28:11] <%dds333a> @chief_chongo I agree, but all the games in this franchise indeed change the importance. tiers, and somewhat abilities within each game
[2:28:44] <+chief_chongo> yeah true
[2:29:04] <%dds333a> certain demons are always important and momentous, such as Metatron, Astaroth, and Melchizedek, and some are always weak, such as pixies, knockers, and slimes, but the spectrum is always variable
[2:29:19] <%Lion_kun> How does a car get poisoned?
[2:29:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Wrong type of fuel
[2:29:36] <%dds333a> hell, Pixie actually subverts that a lot LUL

[3:33:57] <%dds333a> yup, classic SMT overworld
[3:34:01] <andre11dr> They probably just see him floating
[3:34:03] <sirrice77> So is Raidou openly riding on a giant demon though the river and no one has a problem with that?
[3:34:20] <%elderpunch> dr who??

[4:08:36] <%Deft_Thought> I had a nightmare like that once the first time I dated a white girl. NotLikeThis
[4:08:38] <turboyabo> all he need to do to win the fight was give his car some mp
[4:08:42] <%meniscate> Overthinking was the right thing to do this time. Amazing

[4:09:32] <andre11dr> The powers of his huge dick where to much to handle
[4:09:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @XeroRaizer
[4:09:59] <%dds333a> seriously
[4:10:05] <andre11dr> Is that really his best demon?
[4:10:07] <%Prevot> his pierce damage was too high
[4:10:16] <andre11dr> Isn't Oni better
[4:10:29] <Phob05> This game is easy until it decides that you've lived long enough.
[4:10:31] <XeroRaizer> cholo squat
[4:10:46] <%dds333a> get that stun lock
[4:10:51] <Phob05> That was ALMOST another death

[4:11:08] <andre11dr> Nah this is still not that much of a wall
[4:11:20] <turboyabo> yeah all rasputin has to do is spam mudo and he wins
[4:11:21] <andre11dr> Not compared with Matador
[4:11:35] <%dds333a> @andre11dr completely correct. this game has a bit worse
[4:11:52] <+shoryukenabotch> TATSUMAKI
[4:11:58] <%dds333a> alrhough I don't think it's too controversial to say Ras is the first  challenge
[4:12:05] <Phob05> Da
[4:12:10] <XeroRaizer> who is after ras?
[4:12:19] <Phob05> There's at least 3 big ones
[4:12:52] <%dds333a> @xeroraizer I don't wanna say since woolz is playing, but if you're familiar with the game, you can guess
[4:13:09] <XeroRaizer> i actually have never played raidou
