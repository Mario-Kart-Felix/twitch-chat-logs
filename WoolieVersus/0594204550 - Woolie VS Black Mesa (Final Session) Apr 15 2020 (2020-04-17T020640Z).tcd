[0:00:51] <%FallenAngelZelos> fallenangelzelos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[0:00:57] <@Solidus_113> we have a lot of puzzles and combat
[0:00:59] <%13ry4n93> I just came into this let's play where are they?
[0:00:59] <%nothuzad> tomorrow I think Nanani1990
[0:00:59] <Lieutenant_America> Should be a single session
[0:01:00] <+Joelexion> I believe in you
[0:01:12] <%BNPhone> Xen is fanfiction
[0:01:19] <%JetpackMcQuack> Depends on woolie whipSmerg
[0:01:20] <Lieutenant_America> You'll probably feel it less since it's your first time
[0:01:23] <%gatorafan> I also thought you guys had it done by last week, Black Mesa did a LOT to Xen. daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:01:26] <pennykettle_> Xen is Black Mesa dev's job application for a real job
[0:01:29] <+PunJ0hn> but dokapon tho?
[0:01:29] <Huntercd> Reggie lookik
[0:01:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @pennykettle_ TRUE DAT
[0:01:40] <unit24> it is possible
[0:01:43] <Melchior_the_Wise> I think you can do it today
[0:01:44] <Huntercd> hot Reggie
[0:01:45] <OldManDeckardCain> wait, is woolie talking about ff7r or black mesa? Kappa
[0:01:50] <Just_a_Draco> Dew it, finish it
[0:01:51] <GrumpMic> MAX HOSE ARE MAD RN
[0:01:52] <%13ry4n93> Black mesa Xen and regular half life xen are very different
[0:01:54] <koolaid_kevster> 2 mouse4s?
[0:01:55] <+R0bobot> yea but also OG xen is so bad, that I welcomed all it's additions
[0:01:57] <koolaid_kevster> mices?
[0:02:02] <unit24> Xen is my least favorite part of FF7
[0:02:08] <Lieutenant_America> I vastly prefer Black Mesa Xen
[0:02:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[0:02:11] <Willfordbrimly> Is it normal for me to still be seeing trash?
[0:02:20] <unit24> rude
[0:02:24] <%BNPhone> There is a bug in this chapter you are on that will crash your game. If you get an error saying "No free editcs" put these commands in the console ent_remove_all point_template ent_remove_all prop_xen_grunt_pod
[0:02:25] <%ChoculaUltra> I feel like the Valve devs took out some inner demons when designing OG Xen
[0:02:37] <+Slimshazbot> Black Mesa xen is more fun to play but missed the point of what xen is supposed to be IMO
[0:02:38] <@Solidus_113> panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket
[0:02:38] <Lieutenant_America> I mean did you see the Testicle Spider?
[0:02:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:03:00] <%JimJamsJimJamboree> Cheer500 Hey Woolz how much needs to be donated into the blood /peace pools before ya'll agree to the loser getting a "Hoes Mad" tattoo?
[0:03:07] <%13ry4n93> @Lieutenant_America Testicle spiders are kinda hard to miss
[0:03:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> Youtube fans faxing out their donations
[0:03:24] <MyNameIsRasus> 800 dollars!?
[0:03:24] <%BNPhone> LUL
[0:03:25] <%ChoculaUltra> dear lord, 802 is a lot of blood money.
[0:03:45] <robintact> @WoolieVersus Did you see Wario64 tweeted out Persona 5 Royal PC?
[0:04:02] <+RyTYoung> Hey Woolie, Reggie and chat! Is the Blood Pool expanding?
[0:04:06] <@akuda_bar> i played rez this weekend and it was a trip.
[0:04:22] <DatAsuna> THe 2hu channel is still better
[0:04:23] <%xeromage> behold... THE CUBE
[0:04:25] <gunsrlove> wow that flex
[0:04:26] <@akuda_bar> i played rez vr and i was like lol well i won't geek out like woolie did and i was wrong
[0:04:27] <%Gruhunchously> Carve your own path
[0:04:31] <+RyTYoung> CUBE
[0:04:42] <%JetpackMcQuack> Step One: abuse power
[0:04:44] <pennykettle_> If someone wants to give me a list of VR games that are worth the $1k entry fee, go for it. My $1200 stimulus check came in today
[0:04:51] <@Solidus_113> by Room he means channel
[0:04:53] <%BinaryFireball> full cube has happened
[0:04:56] <DatAsuna> I think you misunderstand what he meant by VR room
[0:05:01] <gunsrlove> It's basically the Woolie discord at this point
[0:05:04] <Lieutenant_America> Shit I might miss the Vort Village depending on how long it takes before they get to gameplay
[0:05:28] <%BNPhone> make all pool donations uneven with cents
[0:05:38] <%13ry4n93> I really liked the vort village, it was interesting addition
[0:05:39] <GrumpMic> WITH PENCE
[0:05:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Quick, someone donate π dollars!
[0:06:00] <DSD24> I love Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver
[0:06:09] <+wunp_fxs> Very good VA, decent gameplay
[0:06:17] <+wunp_fxs> also interesting story
[0:06:19] <%MintMuffinGamer> First game I play was the last one.
[0:06:26] <DSD24> Defiance right?
[0:06:29] <gunsrlove> i remember puzzles from DEFIANCE
[0:06:31] <Daxalog> Soul Reaver is a ps1 ass ps1 game.
[0:06:53] <DSD24> Nosgoth was cursed
[0:07:08] <+Slimshazbot> Nosgoth was a decent game just not at ALL what people wanted
[0:07:20] <DSD24> Don't forget about that canceled Legacy of Kain game called Dead Sun
[0:07:23] <DatAsuna> it's too late for that without save editing now
[0:07:35] <+Firgof> When you're done with Sith Lords, you should go look up Kreia's "Lesson of True Strength" on youtube
[0:07:38] <%BinaryFireball> oh shit I just remembered the chexquest remake is multiplayer
[0:07:39] <Lieutenant_America> Boy I'd love to see Woolie try his hand at Mass Effect... though he'd probably go Renegade.
[0:07:59] <DatAsuna> I told woolie I'd slip him hanharr/Mical vids later
[0:08:01] <pennykettle_> NotLikeThis "Kelsey Beachum , writer of "Outer Wilds" has been hired by Obsidian creators of "The Outer Worlds" "
[0:08:01] <%13ry4n93> @Lieutenant_America in the first mass effect that wouldn't be a problem
[0:08:07] <%Javaa01> Yeah, removing mods from a save will break compatibility, so you'd have to do a branching save from the main playthrough
[0:08:13] <%13ry4n93> because renegade in the first game didn't mean psychopath
[0:08:17] <+aishman> Hey guys, I hope you're all having a good day
[0:08:19] <Daxalog> replace lightsabers with a normal low poly sword
[0:08:23] <Lieutenant_America> @13ry4n93 It did make you a Kommisar
[0:08:39] <Lieutenant_America> Who has multiple options to kill people at your mercy for flimsy reasons
[0:08:41] <+Joelexion> Power play
[0:08:44] <Lieutenant_America> Like Shiala
[0:08:46] <DSD24> @13ry4n93 I was Renegade in Mass Effect 3 but I didn't do evil stuff like shooting Mordin
[0:08:56] <%BNPhone> You have to crawl your way out of last place first bawkWeird
[0:08:58] <@Solidus_113> no do it tho
[0:09:00] <+PunJ0hn> 8D chess for dokapon
[0:09:04] <+aishman> Man, I really hope this brings Dokapon on the limelight. Where's Dokapon Switch edition?!
[0:09:16] <+RyTYoung> Big money waster
[0:09:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:09:18] <%prime_name> Money is involved!
[0:09:18] <unit24> even in ME1 renegade shep killed people for basically no reason
[0:09:21] <GrumpMic> @WoolieVersus is there anyway we can hear you make a cover of Hoes Mad, but called SIMPS SAD?
[0:09:29] <DSD24> Only assholes kill Mordin
[0:09:39] <Lieutenant_America> @unit24 ME2 Renegade is arguably the best
[0:09:41] <+RyTYoung> Oh wow that's a lot of gsmes
[0:09:53] <Lieutenant_America> Least amount of psychotic decisions
[0:09:55] <DatAsuna> 3 is the worst one, but it was my first one
[0:09:57] <+theKingRamses> many more than 15
[0:09:58] <@Solidus_113> Tactics
[0:10:01] <+RyTYoung> Tactics, 7 spin offs
[0:10:05] <unit24> renegade is best when you're on tuchanka
[0:10:06] <+Firgof> There's like 30-40
[0:10:08] <+theKingRamses> crystal games
[0:10:10] <@Solidus_113> don't play the 7 spinoffs
[0:10:14] <%jiggy_snipe> what
[0:10:19] <%BNPhone> I don't know the FF by numbers because I played FF1 & 2 (Japanese 1 and 2 which is US who the fuck knows )
[0:10:22] <%Irridium> Thirteen got 2 more. for some reason
[0:10:23] <@SoushinSen> Reggie knows nothing.
[0:10:23] <praisedasun_> woolie no
[0:10:26] <+wunp_fxs> have fun with 13
[0:10:27] <%13ry4n93> Except for Dirge of Cerberus
[0:10:30] <%prime_name> Mystic Quest was like a fake FF, yeah?
[0:10:31] <Lieutenant_America> @unit24 Reneagde on Tuchanka is essential. Like going to a different country and speaking the language.
[0:10:32] <+RyTYoung> Final Fantasy game boy game that I can't remember the name off
[0:10:35] <WSintai> @Solidus_113 Play none of the game, ONLY play Dirge of Cerberus
[0:10:36] <+KR_Black> Dicidia
[0:10:36] <@Menitta> FF4 is FF2 in the west right
[0:10:38] <unit24> exactly
[0:10:38] <+theKingRamses> isn't mystic quest a fake ff
[0:10:41] <DSD24> Mass Effect 3 has some of the best Renegade Options
[0:10:45] <YakumoYomi> Mystic Quest is "Final Fantasy US"
[0:10:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Mystic Quest was a weird side game with BANGER MUSIC
[0:10:47] <DatAsuna> don't use american numbers
[0:10:49] <+PunJ0hn> mystic quest is a spinoff that has no relevance on the series
[0:10:51] <%JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis
[0:10:54] <%Javaa01> @Irridium 13 got 2 more because they were otaku bait
[0:10:54] <Zebroneath> Crystal Chronicles, Tactics, Type 0, other spin offs
[0:10:59] <unit24> morality system is mass effect is still pretty dogshit overall though
[0:11:04] <%Javaa01> And otaku bait sells
[0:11:07] <+RyTYoung> The World of FF
[0:11:13] <%jiggy_snipe> does Final Fantasy Legend and Final Fantasy Adventure count? KappaHD
[0:11:16] <Lieutenant_America> Mass Effect 3's Expanded Galaxy Mod adds some genuinely good moral choices here and there
[0:11:16] <%13ry4n93> @Javaa01 more like cause the director had a crush on Lightning
[0:11:18] <+RyTYoung> I think that's what it's called, the Chino one
[0:11:21] <+RyTYoung> Chibi
[0:11:23] <+KR_Black> Discidia , are we forgeting the fighting game one ?????
[0:11:30] <DatAsuna> Snake's revenge is weird
[0:11:32] <+Firgof> There's the entire *three game* 'music rhythm' series
[0:11:33] <@Solidus_113> Theaterhythm
[0:11:34] <DSD24> My Life as a King was awesome!
[0:11:36] <+theKingRamses> world of final fantasy
[0:11:37] <+KR_Black> i am disapointed in the entire chat
[0:11:37] <+CatastropheCorvid> Tactics
[0:11:38] <%Irridium> @Javaa01 well, at least Lightning Returns bombed. I can take solace in that.
[0:11:40] <YakumoYomi> Final Fantasy Adventure is actually a Seiken Densetsu game
[0:11:43] <+Firgof> Chocobo's Dungeon
[0:11:44] <WSintai> Dissidia 012 is a damn good game
[0:11:56] <%Javaa01> Theatherythm Last Call is great tho, and the DLC is quality stuff
[0:11:58] <@Menitta> type 0....
[0:12:00] <+Bluemanzee> The tactics advance games are super fun
[0:12:05] <DatAsuna> Don't forget to read all the novels
[0:12:11] <%prime_name> Tactics is a game I love but never finished
[0:12:17] <%Prevot> tactics is better than regular FF, so....
[0:12:17] <jiggydoo> <3
[0:12:22] <+KR_Black> YAY for living \o/
[0:12:30] <+Firgof> #calledout
[0:12:34] <%jiggy_snipe> drop your shield Woolie
[0:12:35] <%KingOfTheGeats> drop your shield though
[0:12:38] <aluddss> tru
[0:12:40] <Daxalog> Fast and loose but optimized
[0:12:45] <@Solidus_113> I hope you're always using your ATB right when you get it
[0:12:51] <$R3Roundabout> DROP YOUR SHEILD!
[0:12:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Drop it tho
[0:12:54] <YakumoYomi> I don't even use shields in Souls games
[0:12:54] <DatAsuna> perfect
[0:13:04] <MyNameIsRasus> P E R F E C T
[0:13:05] <$R3Roundabout> "Early on"
[0:13:12] <@akuda_bar> it's Zelda logic, you just think you should always hold it up
[0:13:15] <+KR_Black> Dont use that elixir Wollie , Why Pat ? i may need it later ?? No , just dont use ir
[0:13:18] <%Prevot> you know what I mean
[0:13:23] <%BNPhone> perfect
[0:13:23] <%jinking79> "You know what i mean"
[0:13:24] <%JetpackMcQuack> Pat brought it up LAST WEEK
[0:13:34] <Lieutenant_America> It's kinda like Perfect Parrying
[0:13:37] <Lieutenant_America> You gotta time it
[0:13:41] <+Joelexion> Block prevents Stam regen
[0:13:46] <pshuuu> you have to hit them
[0:13:46] <SomersaultJustice> its wolly time
[0:14:03] <pshuuu> speed
[0:14:13] <%Javaa01> If you run out of stamina while blocking you get blown out
[0:14:16] <@akuda_bar> thassa aaaaaaaliennn
[0:14:17] <+theKingRamses> blocking slows stamina regen
[0:14:19] <%nothuzad> chip is based on the block value - there is 100% block
[0:14:23] <@Solidus_113> when you have zero stamina and block you get blown open
[0:14:32] <Lieutenant_America> Stamanagement
[0:14:35] <pennykettle_> And it doesnt refill when you have the shield raised. if you dont need to block you need to drop the shield
[0:14:44] <%13ry4n93> oh
[0:14:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> No
[0:14:45] <pennykettle_> Are these pre-game talks being uploaded as its own mini morning podcast yet lol
[0:14:49] <serpenttucker> More importantly you get opened the fuck up when you are blocking with "not enough" stamina for an attack
[0:14:51] <@Menitta> this is why Nioh is great
[0:14:52] <fazoburquina> huh that's one way to look at it
[0:14:54] <DSD24> Always be going IN
[0:15:01] <@Solidus_113> It's Active Battling
[0:15:03] <pennykettle_> That turn based thing is exactly right
[0:15:08] <Drchandragupta> REGGIE PLAYS SOULS WHEN
[0:15:09] <DSD24> In Bloodborne at least
[0:15:10] <%Javaa01> But then you learn to disrespect the game and then it's ALWAYS your turn
[0:15:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> @menitta Double-Flux Ki Pulse for INFINITE KI
[0:15:12] <pennykettle_> Always jump the gun
[0:15:15] <+Firgof> Always go in -> always be stagger
[0:15:17] <Daxalog> Kill them before your stamina runs out
[0:15:17] <Lieutenant_America> Tell that to those fuckers who play LoinCloth Men
[0:15:19] <@akuda_bar> always go out
[0:15:22] <%Irridium> never stop going in
[0:15:28] <%ECRead> Yeah Nioh handles that really well
[0:15:38] <%jiggy_snipe> there are dudes who can always go in and have no problem
[0:15:45] <%BNPhone> OG Xen is made out to be worse than it really is
[0:15:49] <DSD24> Nioh 2 is a blast
[0:15:49] <%ekodrop> SLOG
[0:15:50] <%BNPhone> It's trendy
[0:15:51] <%Javaa01> Zen is ass, but it is brief
[0:15:52] <Lieutenant_America> OG Xen isn't unplayable, but it's a step down
[0:15:52] <+Firgof> Xen was OK.
[0:15:59] <+RyTYoung> I haven't played teh half lifes
[0:15:59] <%Irridium> it's not "as bad" as everyone says but it's still kinda ass
[0:15:59] <%Javaa01> In the original
[0:16:00] <bleugh> i never hated it...
[0:16:00] <@Solidus_113> I finished FF7R last night
[0:16:01] <Lieutenant_America> Only Interloper is an actual level
[0:16:04] <Lieutenant_America> In OG Xen
[0:16:08] <+therabbles> og xen is functional and thats it
[0:16:10] <pennykettle_> Xen has its own atmosphere that is different from the new one. worth looking at for 10 minutes. Good luck even beating the first few rooms with the old long jump
[0:16:11] <%13ry4n93> @xx123manxx I don't know man, xen was meh at best and tedious at worst
[0:16:13] <+KR_Black> Chat , how are we with FFVII spoilers ?
[0:16:18] <+Firgof> Die
[0:16:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:16:19] <@Solidus_113> no spoils
[0:16:21] <+RyTYoung> @solidus_113 It was a wild ride
[0:16:24] <@akuda_bar> @KR_Black do not
[0:16:25] <@Solidus_113> I see one you get deleted
[0:16:25] <%jinking79> doodSwear
[0:16:29] <+KR_Black> Alright
[0:16:30] <%Javaa01> The rest of HL1 original holds up, but Zen is not good
[0:16:34] <%karldeck> I meant the game, but alright
[0:16:34] <+KR_Black> Thanks mods
[0:16:35] <%13ry4n93> @KR_Black I know that Sephiroth killed dumbledore
[0:16:37] <pennykettle_> When you hit the portal, credits used to roll
[0:16:42] <%Javaa01> Yeah, no one plays through Zen on a replay
[0:16:44] <Krimxon> Why spoil a game <7 days old fucker?
[0:16:45] <%Gruhunchously> Nobody likes Xen
[0:16:48] <Krimxon> fml
[0:16:48] <unit24> I feel like you can sum up the difference in atmosphere between the two versions based on the tracks that play when you first arrive
[0:16:56] <@Menitta> that guy next to you
[0:16:56] <RaulGBastos1991> Woolie, one question, why you are so cool?
[0:16:59] <TheFranss> Aight what's up? Living in Eastern European daytime SUCKS
[0:17:01] <Daxalog> Oh yeah! BABY
[0:17:10] <%karldeck> @WoolieVersus : I meant the game, but alright
[0:17:13] <pennykettle_> LUL
[0:17:14] <fazoburquina> I think the problem is that going from amazing to just ok feels worse than it good to ok
[0:17:17] <%karldeck> Half life
[0:17:17] <%ECRead> oh yeah Nioh 2 is great. I love that they just straight up put DTs and Royalguard and Trickster into the game
[0:17:20] <+wunp_fxs> LUL
[0:17:22] <DSD24> Oh man we need to see with eyes on the inside
[0:17:23] <@Solidus_113> He wants a Reggie Bloodborne LP
[0:17:24] <unit24> first game says "welcome to hell, you're fucked now" the new one is like "look at this beautiful alien world"
[0:17:25] <@Menitta> Guy wants Reggie to play Bloodborne
[0:17:29] <%Prevot> thats an aaaaaalien
[0:17:30] <pennykettle_> I literally have a bloodborne tattoo and i have no idea what he just said
[0:17:35] <+theKingRamses> reggie vs bloodborne when
[0:17:37] <+Slimshazbot> Black Mesa's Xen looks impressive but totally loses what Xen was supposed to be. OG Xen was an almost inhospitable group of asteroid floating in the space between dimensions. A space where life struggles to exist. Black Mesa makes it seems like a wonderful alien rainforest.
[0:17:37] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus he's asking you to make reggie play bloodborne
[0:17:38] <+Firgof> 'two years ago, bloodborne final'
[0:17:40] <%prime_name> SPEED
[0:17:46] <pennykettle_> LUL
[0:17:48] <+linSP> We doin bloodborne??
[0:17:49] <+Firgof> oh hell it's 5 years now lol
[0:17:50] <+KR_Black> @krimxon 7 days ??? and thats why i asked , because i wanted to know if discussing story was ok
[0:17:51] <%ekodrop> that was yesterday
[0:17:53] <+RyTYoung> 5 YEARS
[0:18:01] <TheFranss> "You know what I mean?"
[0:18:01] <@Menitta> thats like last week right
[0:18:02] <+kewlmyc> I think they wanted a Reggie Bloodborne LP
[0:18:04] <%ECRead> OH NO IM OLD
[0:18:05] <fazoburquina> DONT LET IT SET IN chat
[0:18:06] <DSD24> Bloodborne hype never ends
[0:18:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> 5 years is nothing
[0:18:09] <+Firgof> Time to break out the Spike and Barley memes
[0:18:16] <+RyTYoung> 5 years is EVERYTHING
[0:18:17] <+DakotaMacDoodle> 5 years? oh no...

[0:18:42] <+linSP> LUL

[0:19:30] <SomersaultJustice> what if you just write it with a sharpie
[0:19:32] <DSD24> Everything is on hold
[0:19:33] <%ECRead> my sis is a tat artist... I feel

[0:19:41] <fazoburquina> !Tattoo at Risk!!
[0:19:43] <+theKingRamses> black market tattoos
[0:19:45] <+KR_Black> @krimxon the part i was going to discuss is the same in the 2 games , if a certain character received enough punishment for his actions or got away easy , and his fate is the same
[0:19:47] <DatAsuna> Tattoos aren't essential, but the WWE is apparently
[0:19:48] <GrumpMic> all because of the Backstreet Boys reunion tour (Game Grump refference)
[0:19:49] <%Superbro64> tats arent essential sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[0:19:49] <DSD24> No more haircuts either
[0:19:51] <pennykettle_> People are STILL doing stick and pokes
[0:19:53] <ingman112> The cowardice beckons
[0:19:55] <+linSP> gotta go to jail for tat

[0:20:28] <fazoburquina> the chat demands BLOOD
[0:20:30] <%gatorafan> At this rate someone will be able to buy a car with the bloodpool daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:20:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> Will it get as serious as the Mailbag?

[0:20:53] <ingman112> Blood pool for the blood god
[0:20:55] <@SoushinSen> why do i have a -15?

[0:21:07] <+RyTYoung> $902
[0:21:07] <pennykettle_> PogChamp woolie donating his own cent
[0:21:15] <%prime_name> Someone is going to die.
[0:21:18] <%ekodrop> pay it out on stream when it's over woolie
[0:21:18] <@akuda_bar> we need to get it to 69 cents
[0:21:20] <+linSP> blood will spill
[0:21:23] <+PunJ0hn> someone might just get stabbed
[0:21:24] <%BNPhone> bawkSweat bawkSweat bawkSweat bawkSweat
[0:21:28] <+theKingRamses> he didn't say no to .98s
[0:21:30] <+RyTYoung> I WANNA SEE 4 DIGITS
[0:21:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> We killed the penny for a reason
[0:21:42] <pennykettle_> This is true
[0:21:45] <%Superbro64> I thought Canada rounds up to the dollar? Didnt they can the penny?
[0:21:48] <%jiggy_snipe> very correct
[0:21:50] <DSD24> Non euclidean geometry
[0:21:52] <%The_Timo> Should have the money dangling just in frame during final stream
[0:21:53] <gunsrlove> Don't spoil things now
[0:21:57] <+KR_Black> Oh so is just like Pandemonium
[0:21:57] <%BNPhone> Black Mesa Xen is fanfiction, there is very little that is actually in Half-Life. Exploding houndeyes & HEV Zombies are Black Mesa additions It is very pretty but 99% of what's happening here is not Half-Life canon
[0:21:57] <%Superbro64> I thought woolie and co talked about that in fact
[0:21:58] <%Gruhunchously> They call it the border world
[0:21:59] <IamGreven> i bet you never expected playing video games for a blood pool
[0:22:00] <pennykettle_> Xen is supposed to be an alien place to everyone
[0:22:07] <%Javaa01> There's a plot reason for that
[0:22:09] <+Firgof> @WoolieVersus Loser should have to stream an entire run of Pathologic 2 on Twitch with the winner's branding on their stream
[0:22:10] <@akuda_bar> yeah but it's full of humans too, why's that confusing lol
[0:22:10] <%Javaa01> You'll get it later
[0:22:11] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus They ended up there but aren't native to it
[0:22:18] <DSD24> The Boarder World.......XEN
[0:22:21] <GrumpMic> @WoolieVersus should do a Hoes Mad cover, but it's called Hannharr Sad
[0:22:25] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus twitch viewer numbers are bugged. just letting you guys know because everyone is losing viewers
[0:22:27] <serpenttucker> How do we know flora and fauna haven't adapted??
[0:22:33] <pennykettle_> The aliens are refugees. not a spoiler
[0:22:40] <@SoushinSen> But I'm innocent, I'm the hero who saved 15 towns!
[0:22:41] <%ECRead> Dokapon is also only about halfway done too. the pool will be deep
[0:22:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> That’ll be in HL3 Kappa
[0:22:46] <DSD24> @Zayasu Oh wow I just noticed
[0:22:51] <%Superbro64> @zayasu twitch is bleeding out its behind again?
[0:22:51] <DatAsuna> i
[0:22:52] <+RyTYoung> i
[0:22:53] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus A lot of the lore isn't directly explained it game TBH. I'm sure people will catch you up after you beat it
[0:22:54] <+Firgof> i
[0:22:54] <+PunJ0hn> i
[0:22:57] <%karldeck> I
[0:22:58] <serpenttucker> i
[0:22:58] <ingman112> Xen is the highway between cities, and you got people camping out under it
[0:23:00] <@akuda_bar> a lot of things would be fun
[0:23:01] <jaid251> I
[0:23:01] <PsychedelicSnake> i
[0:23:02] <Kraahka> I'm pretty sure an ecosystem could be established if a bunch of different organisms are there
[0:23:06] <SomersaultJustice> have reggie play KSS
[0:23:07] <Enemy_In_Disguise> i
[0:23:07] <+Firgof> Especially with new DLC for Controol
[0:23:07] <Fenlig> I still have to play it myself
[0:23:08] <unit24> I think the lore should be ignored until HL2
[0:23:09] <+Joelexion> I
[0:23:09] <+RyTYoung> The new DLC is cool too!
[0:23:11] <+KR_Black> @woolieversus Think about the Witcher , the humans and the monsters are not natives to the world they current inhavit
[0:23:16] <@Solidus_113> Eternal
[0:23:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ingman112 That's a good analogy

[0:28:33] <%BNPhone> Shame the one guys so they stop
[0:28:35] <Lieutenant_America> One guy fucked Episode 7 for me
[0:28:35] <MillaMoks> They don't ALL round up. You round up on 3, 4, 8, and 9 cents, you round down on 1, 2, 6, and 7 cents.
[0:28:37] <%Superbro64> doodTerror
[0:28:47] <+LordHusbando> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[0:28:53] <+Firgof> @MillaMoks That sounds way overcomplicated
[0:28:59] <DSD24> @Superbro64 The Mods were timing out a bunch of people
[0:29:02] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah Max's chat is....whew boy I wonder if he reads during his FF7 sessions
[0:29:04] <ohnogino> vineStahp

[0:29:17] <skattikus> does this man use two mice and refuse to try wasd????
[0:29:19] <@SoushinSen> @Firgof not complicated, that's just how it is. whichever is closer to teh 5 cent.
[0:29:22] <+Firgof> My audience numbers are finally on par with Woolie's
[0:29:26] <%BNPhone> how close is woolie to finishing kotor?

[0:29:39] <aka_Jigawatt> do do LUL
[0:29:41] <MillaMoks> @Firgof It does sound complicated like that, but what it comes down to is basic rounding to the nearest multiple of 5. Its like that because otherwise people would get rightly upset that they are always having to pay more
[0:29:42] <%jiggy_snipe> personally I like that Woolie plays off meta stuff. It introduces us to random stuff
[0:29:44] <Lieutenant_America> @dsd24 DAMN IT
[0:30:03] <%Superbro64> 40 YEAR LONG LP

[0:33:48] <+therabbles> the old hustle
[0:33:53] <%Javaa01> Reggie, if you want to play a smoother version of Castlevania 1, just play Super Castlevania 4, it's a full remake on SNES
[0:33:59] <%lotharrio> Ah, hope it's a cold.
[0:34:03] <%jinking79> Lion King man
[0:34:11] <%The_Timo> replay value wasn't important back in the day lol, you bought the game you paid, at that point it wasn't important anymore. Franchises didn't mean as much back then until sequels came
[0:34:19] <MyNameIsRasus> They took some artistic liberties

[0:35:23] <MillaMoks> @WoolieVersus Oh yea, Reggie, Castlevania 2 is super horse shit. Not because it's hard but because it has nonsense shit that is not explained well at all like crouching in one particular corner and waiting while holding a item.
[0:35:32] <MyNameIsRasus> Instead of using memory to remember which enemies died, we can use that memory on MORE ENEMIES
[0:35:32] <%Javaa01> Super Castlevania 4 includes basically all the memorable layouts of Castlevania 1, but it adds a lot to the game as well

[0:58:55] <%BNPhone> How close does you say run start playing?
[0:59:10] <+theKingRamses> the galungas were roasting them on an open fire

[0:59:50] <+Firgof> woolie don't pretend we wouldn't send honey badger care packages
[0:59:57] <Lieutenant_America> It's more that the Slaves and Soldiers are taking advantage of reality getting ripped apart

[1:00:10] <+theKingRamses> the vorts were roasting the headcrabs like rotisserie chicken in that last area

[1:00:16] <+therabbles> someone wanted that big mama nut
[1:00:20] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus Not all the aliens on earth were sent in deliberately. The "Resonance cascade" that occuredripped uncontrollable portals to xen all across both worlds.

[1:13:26] <%Javaa01> It's not, but the controller is not making this jump any easier
[1:13:29] <+therabbles> gold experience is a fault of the game design

[1:13:30] <%derap41> The Machine Spirit is angry at your transgresions
[1:13:32] <Kraahka> It actually is the setup because he stops in midair when he lets go of the stick as he jumps

[1:13:34] <+Firgof> Manual Bugfix Time
[1:13:35] <Lieutenant_America> No what we're saying is that a keyboard lets you save on the fly with the press of a button to avoid this issue

[1:16:33] <mariovspit> hi. long time viewer on youtube. first time on twitch
[1:16:34] <chickenhunter> try the other death loop autosave, maybe youre higher up
[1:16:35] <+Domukari> reverse gravity
[1:16:35] <Kraahka> Hold back
[1:16:35] <%GraceTBM> aim straight up after putting the cehats in
[1:16:37] <+Fooguwu> @WoolieVersus I'm looking at a screenshot online of a sprint key binding, are you sure that isn't a feature?
[1:16:37] <%gatorafan> DANGER ZONE
[1:16:39] <Fenlig> Use no clip to fly back to the latest spot!
[1:16:39] <shamuzu> NotLikeThis
[1:16:45] <%Javaa01> Well, gotta do it for real cause you can't cheat good
[1:16:49] <+Firgof> Rats. Oldsource null'd all movement when you noclip
[1:16:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> OTHER DEATH SAVE MIGHT BE HIGHER?
[1:16:52] <+therabbles> honestly could probably just noclip up until that last point they were at
[1:17:01] <%GraceTBM> do nothing and aim up immediately upon putting the cheats in
[1:17:01] <MyNameIsRasus> There goes this being the last stream
[1:17:01] <@Solidus_113> now THIS is the Source experience
[1:17:02] <+Domukari> sv_gravity -400
[1:17:02] <Lieutenant_America> See the nice thing about Halo is that whenever you get checkpointed into a death loop, after enough loops it sets you back another checkpoint
[1:17:03] <Kraahka> Jump doesn't do anything I think you need to hold back
[1:17:07] <Lieutenant_America> Bungie knew their shit
[1:17:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @yamikami13
[1:17:18] <@Solidus_113> opening the console pauses the game

[1:17:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> TRY OTHER SAVE
[1:17:39] <%BNPhone> you used the same one i believe
[1:17:40] <+That_Mojo> both saves were tried
[1:17:41] <%jiggy_snipe> just run it back
[1:17:41] <+Fooguwu> can anyone in chat confirm or deconfirm if there is a sprint feature?
[1:17:41] <yamikami13> let go of the controller
[1:17:42] <%natebud> Did the game wipe out his past autosaves?
[1:17:42] <%Javaa01> Wrong save
[1:17:45] <Fenlig> Use no clip from your quick save to catch up!
[1:17:46] <%MaddyCaddy> You can noclip through the entire section in the quicksave
[1:17:48] <%aeravon> attempting to save time can be the biggest waste of time :)
[1:17:52] <%BNPhone> see that one is WAAAY higher

[1:18:14] <%BNPhone> yeah fucked
[1:18:16] <Camail> gravity might not affect his previous acceleration
[1:18:20] <%GraceTBM> these saves suck just start from the quicksave
[1:18:22] <+Firgof> @goldstein3r lol what no
[1:18:24] <+R0bobot> It really isn't.

[1:18:27] <dukenux> just go back to quicksave. was that like 10 minutes ago?
[1:18:29] <+Grayhammatter> momentum's way too much
[1:18:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOCLIP TO CATCH UP
[1:18:31] <Fenlig> Use your quicksave and use noclip to fly through the map!
[1:18:32] <+Firgof> Triggers don't care about your health lol
[1:18:36] <%BNPhone> just godmode your way thru Keepo
[1:18:41] <+Fooguwu> @Javaa01 he's falling from momentum, not going forward

[1:19:19] <%Gruhunchously> Why take precautions against things that aren't going to happen?
[1:19:20] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @brian_peppers1
[1:19:21] <%arkv01> paranoid saving is what turns men into monsters
[1:19:25] <+Firgof> @Javaa01 Oldsource cancels momentum. This one preserves for some reason

[1:26:19] <%KnivesEve> how did he forget this quickly lol
[1:26:21] <skattikus> can i link a gamefaqs or something lol
[1:26:22] <%jiggy_snipe> corner combos
[1:26:22] <Lieutenant_America> Because you keep losing all momentum whenever you jump
[1:26:22] <+R0bobot> You HAVE to make that jump at the ledge on your reload.
[1:26:24] <MyNameIsRasus> DON'T GO FOR HEALING
[1:26:25] <%lotharrio> It's no the healing. Avoid the healing.
[1:26:26] <%Haarute> BEFORE THE HEALIN
[1:26:30] <gunsrlove> DONT GO FOR HEALING
[1:26:31] <MyNameIsRasus> NO HEALTH

[1:26:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> No health
[1:26:37] <%Haarute> HEALTH WAS BEFORE AND YOU MISSED IT
[1:26:44] <alrobot2014> the health is the fuck up
[1:26:48] <Ashenik1> How long of the game left ?
[1:26:48] <%Javaa01> Stop botching the jump tho
[1:26:55] <Lieutenant_America> I don't get it he made that jump the first run
[1:26:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[1:26:59] <Kraahka> Hold the stick forward as you jump @WoolieVersus it keeps your momentum

[1:27:09] <+Slimshazbot> ??
[1:27:13] <Lieutenant_America> HE TURNED AROUND MID TUNNEL
[1:27:15] <Drchandragupta> HYPEST GAMEPLAY ON TWITCH
[1:27:20] <%Javaa01> SAVE BEFORE JUMP
[1:27:27] <%BNPhone> this is what i came here for
[1:27:31] <gunsrlove> You can go back if you whiff the jump
[1:27:41] <%gatorafan> Jump Gooder daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:27:44] <brian_peppers1> IS THIS WHAT HELL FEELS LIKE?
[1:27:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Go into brain settings and uncheck "Getting lost"
[1:27:50] <+R0bobot> please just hold the stick forward
[1:27:52] <skattikus> hahahaha how much longer till keyboard?
[1:27:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Is he losing momentum a source thing
[1:27:56] <Lieutenant_America> Hold forward on the stick when jumping
[1:27:58] <%BNPhone> have reggie on f5 / f7 duty?
[1:28:04] <@Solidus_113> okay, so the jumps you're missing have literally nothing to do with geometry, I think I figured it out
[1:28:08] <%BNPhone> i dunno how possible that is with ur setup
[1:28:13] <+Grayhammatter> shut up about keyboard you fuck
[1:28:14] <Snorlax47> weeeeeee

[1:28:26] <gamewarden92> Oooooooo
[1:28:32] <%BNPhone> ooooooooOOOOOooooOOOo
[1:28:34] <Drchandragupta> omg I seriously thought the lost moment was some weird glitch with the hybrid setup
[1:28:34] <%lotharrio> Save here
[1:28:35] <+Grayhammatter> PERFECT
[1:28:35] <Lieutenant_America> It was never the rock
[1:28:35] <MyNameIsRasus> SAVE
[1:28:36] <+therabbles> save
[1:28:39] <%Javaa01> @brian_peppers1 This is closer to Limbo, but the person that's your tour guide can't read the map and keeps doubling back constantly
[1:28:41] <%jiggy_snipe> save
[1:28:43] <+R0bobot> Of course they don't, the momentum thing is purely a player/control issue.
[1:28:49] <Lieutenant_America> It was never the level architecture
[1:28:53] <%BNPhone> GANBARRE
[1:28:54] <dukenux> DEW IT
[1:28:55] <@Solidus_113> I think what's happening is there are too many inputs happening at once, so the computer is dropping them all, like when you press multiple keys at the same time
[1:28:57] <Drchandragupta> HA
[1:28:57] <KillMyPast> THE ROCK
[1:28:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> you let go

[1:29:09] <%Javaa01> @MaddyCaddy Autorun

[1:29:29] <brian_peppers1> @Javaa01 Spot on
[1:29:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> you have to sprint
[1:29:31] <PsychedelicSnake> What an amazing remaster of Xen
[1:29:31] <%prime_name> Yeah multiplayer!
[1:29:36] <MyNameIsRasus> This sequence doesn't seem like it was playtested
[1:29:38] <%BNPhone> !! HE IS SPRINTING !!
[1:29:40] <%MaddyCaddy> Sprint has an animation
[1:29:44] <%BNPhone> hes just missing
[1:29:48] <chickenhunter> this isnt sprinting
[1:29:50] <+R0bobot> I don't think he is sprinting
[1:29:51] <KillMyPast> Sprint
[1:29:52] <+nintega010> I can't wait for Dokopon tomorrow
[1:29:53] <+gZombiex> he's not sprinting
[1:29:54] <@akuda_bar> that was not a sprint
[1:29:56] <Lieutenant_America> I don't understand
[1:29:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Not sprinting
[1:29:57] <%natebud> autorun is same speed as sprint
[1:29:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> Autorun isn't sprint
[1:29:58] <skattikus> hes not sprinting dude
[1:29:59] <%jiggy_snipe> clipped the rock
[1:29:59] <brian_peppers1> YOU ARE NOT SPRINTING WOOLIE
[1:30:01] <+Slimshazbot> The sprinting animation isn't going

[1:30:18] <%prime_name> That's...wha?
[1:30:19] <brian_peppers1> JESUS FINALLY
[1:30:20] <Drchandragupta> This sequence is not unplaytested @MyNameIsRasus Woolie is just having a phenominally hard time because he doesn't know how to sprint
[1:30:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Spprint uses energy
[1:30:25] <+Fooguwu> I KNEW IT
[1:30:26] <brian_peppers1> OH MY GOD
[1:30:27] <Lieutenant_America> @Slimshazbot Autorun doesn't have sprint
[1:30:30] <skattikus> LUL
[1:30:30] <unit24> sprint does not use energy
[1:30:32] <Enemy_In_Disguise> THANK GOD
[1:30:33] <iggeh> he didn't know....
[1:30:33] <Lieutenant_America> It doesn't NEED sprint
[1:30:37] <Lieutenant_America> It's AUTORUN
[1:30:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> OH MY GOD
[1:30:39] <%natebud> I made that jump with autorun on
[1:30:40] <brian_peppers1> WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER THIS MUCH
[1:30:40] <JaseAdrift> OMG
[1:30:46] <+R0bobot> I KNEW IT
[1:30:46] <%Javaa01> @doc_ock_rokc Black Mesa doesn't have the Aux power system of Half Life 2
[1:30:47] <MyNameIsRasus> That's fair
[1:30:50] <Lieutenant_America> I always play with autorun, this never happens
[1:30:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> oh
[1:30:55] <%insomniacCoder> 84 years later
[1:30:59] <+Fooguwu> HMMMM
[1:31:05] <dukenux> HMM
[1:31:08] <DSD24> The Interloper Problem
[1:31:10] <%jiggy_snipe> well let's see
[1:31:11] <%lotharrio> Never played Black Mesa so I have no idea!
[1:31:14] <+gZombiex> Sprint has unique animations and sound
[1:31:17] <Lieutenant_America> @DSD24 This is all Woolie
[1:31:26] <%prime_name> Oh?
[1:31:29] <@Solidus_113> I think what's happening is there are too many inputs happening at once, so the computer is dropping them all, like when you press multiple keyboard keys at the same time
[1:31:32] <%natebud> Chat is wrong, autorun works fine in this sequence
[1:31:32] <Kraahka> Autorun is sprint I'm pretty sure
[1:31:34] <+tuchpi> bottom left galunga LUL
[1:31:35] <+gZombiex> still not sprinting
[1:31:37] <Drchandragupta> Yeah you're not sprinting woolie, there's a special animation
[1:31:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> rock on the right
[1:31:43] <VizualBlitz> can he jump up from the thing on the right? or am i dumb?
[1:31:45] <%Vorga1339> @gZombiex if autorun is on it removes the sprint animations
[1:31:48] <+R0bobot> sprinting has an animation associated
[1:31:50] <Drchandragupta> @natebud sprint isn't necessary but it would help for woolie's purposes
[1:31:56] <brian_peppers1> Hey Woolie why not try the keyboard?
[1:31:57] <+gZombiex> Try loading an older save before the chase to test sprinting
[1:32:02] <+R0bobot> oh, it removes the animations?
[1:32:06] <%Javaa01> @R0bobot The sprint animation gets disabled with autorun
[1:32:08] <+Fooguwu> It just works!
[1:32:11] <+fizzguy47> chat is full of shit, as always
[1:32:11] <Lieutenant_America> @Drchandragupta Yeah but it's not ON during Autorun. You'd have to turn Autorun off to use Srpint
[1:32:21] <PsychedelicSnake> NotLikeThis
[1:32:23] <Drchandragupta> WHAT
[1:32:25] <Melchior_the_Wise> Turn Autorun off to sprint
[1:32:28] <%natebud> you idiots, autorun is the same speed
[1:32:28] <Drchandragupta> CROWBAR COLLECTIVE WHY
[1:32:28] <Enemy_In_Disguise> If only you had a dedicated button on a board of sorts to sprint. Like a “shift” key of sorts.
[1:32:40] <@Solidus_113> I literally never ran into this issue
[1:32:42] <Lieutenant_America> @Drchandragupta This is not Crowbar
[1:32:47] <%jiggy_snipe> load a previous save and test auto run off to see if you can sprint
[1:32:49] <Drchandragupta> Then what is it?
[1:32:52] <%BNPhone> Hey dipshits who told me he's not sprint.. eat shit
[1:32:52] <+Slimshazbot> SO FAST Pog

[1:34:04] <Ashenik1> was this music in the original?
[1:34:05] <silverira> he gets actual sprint only on HL2 guys
[1:34:06] <+Grayhammatter> is that a cliff on the right side?
[1:34:10] <+GentlemanHmr> jump off the long rock to the right
[1:34:13] <Kraahka> The issue here isn't that he isn't sprinting, it's that when he jumps he lets go of the stick which stops momentum
[1:34:13] <+Aeoneth> are you able to use the rock spire on the righ side of the cliff as you approach the gap?
[1:34:13] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe right before the edge
[1:34:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Clipping geometry somewhere

[1:34:15] <+Slimshazbot> @Ashenik1 no
[1:34:18] <%lotharrio> There's a ramp/outcropping on the right which might help you get the distance/height?
[1:34:20] <JaseAdrift> that rock on the right though
[1:34:23] <%Haarute> jump from the rock to get the extra height-distance instead of avoiding it?

[2:13:26] <Lieutenant_America> "Do you want a ciagrette? Not you, the hand."
[2:13:27] <%Balkespower> anything for science
[2:13:28] <dukenux> He says "that's kinda hot"
[2:13:31] <%MaddyCaddy> He calls you a sicko
[2:13:32] <AppleBerryKitty> LUL
[2:13:33] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:13:34] <%Gruhunchously> He has several lines
[2:13:41] <%Gruhunchously> "It's always the quiet ones"
[2:13:43] <Lieutenant_America> "Dude, if I find a camera you are SO doing that again!"
[2:13:51] <+Grayhammatter> nice jump cancel
[2:13:51] <unit24> ngl that was an impressive jump cancel
[2:13:55] <+RowenCleric> "...are you free later?"
[2:14:00] <%Gruhunchously> "You want a cigarette? Not you, the hand."
[2:14:01] <Lieutenant_America> "I'm not sure if you're a genius or sicko for figuring that out."
[2:14:12] <valachi> It's a shame how Valve will literally never show the gearbox expansions some love outside of that one reference with Barney.
[2:14:14] <%derap41> Reggie Smarts
[2:14:25] <+Taglog7> IT'S GAMERS

[2:15:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> @maddycaddy Who? KappaPride
[2:15:19] <%Gruhunchously> To be fair Half Life: Opposing Force may be the one thing of any value created by Gearbox.
[2:15:26] <The_Nightmare_Emperor> Ralph the Wolf and Sam Sheepdog
[2:15:31] <Daxalog> How do you remember all this?
[2:15:34] <Lieutenant_America> Opposing Force I never cared much for
[2:15:36] <%natebud> and it isnt even that good @Gruhunchously
[2:15:41] <%BNPhone> OpFor is alright
[2:15:41] <AppleBerryKitty> "oh no! Not the blue guy again!!"
[2:15:41] <brian_peppers1> Platforming Woolies favorite
[2:15:42] <valachi> Yeah and that's exactly why it deserves the love
[2:15:48] <+Fooguwu> gzen
[2:15:58] <%Gruhunchously> @natebud Yeah, well...
[2:15:58] <%Balkespower> look at the GENOME SOLDIERS!
[2:15:59] <valachi> I'd say Opposing Force was better than the main game tbh
[2:16:00] <%derap41> SLURM factory all over
[2:16:00] <@Solidus_113> those are the grunts
[2:16:02] <dukenux> I don't miss Race X, but i would welcome Shepher getting more play
[2:16:03] <+theKingRamses> are those tyrants
[2:16:06] <gunsrlove> Reggie with the French - kzen
[2:16:10] <%Balkespower> BROTHERS!
[2:16:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:16:12] <dukenux> they're getting strogified
[2:16:13] <%Irridium> what is this quake 4
[2:16:13] <Lieutenant_America> The Grunts are grown here
[2:16:15] <%jepupu> Did I see G-man for a while?
[2:16:16] <%MaddyCaddy> Is that Adam?
[2:16:18] <%Estuko> monkaS
[2:16:19] <%natebud> OpFor has terrible level design.
[2:16:21] <dukenux> This is the Grunt Factory
[2:16:25] <+Ryu_R> those are actually mutant vortigaunts
[2:16:37] <PsychedelicSnake> The slave masters are also slaves to a slave master that is also a slave
[2:16:40] <%Gruhunchously> Gordon....stop it...
[2:16:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> Brain guy enslave small bois to make big bois
[2:16:47] <AppleBerryKitty> I've only played the nonsteam version years back, this is all new to me.
[2:16:48] <Lieutenant_America> I still haven't see the evidence that Vorts are made into Grunts. It's a great idea, but I don't see the evidence
[2:16:49] <%derap41> Its like some Insect society
[2:16:50] <%lotharrio> Spoilers: These games are actually all about slavery, who knew?
[2:16:54] <dukenux> Is this what a vort based Supermutant would look like?
[2:16:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> Starting to think slavery is kinda cringe guys.... :/
[2:16:59] <%derap41> With Drones Warriors and leader casts
[2:17:01] <AppleBerryKitty> this is some serious s***
[2:17:05] <%natebud> Yeah more plug puzzles, get hyped PogChamp
[2:17:05] <+Ryu_R> @Lieutenant_America they have the chest arm the same as the vorts
[2:17:07] <jorniev> it oarries it
[2:17:13] <+RowenCleric> thats actuallly the subtitle, Half Life: A lot of Slavery
[2:17:13] <+linSP> free the galungas
[2:17:18] <+Freeborg1997> @FuqBoiSlim :D
[2:17:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> Woolie’s gonna like this series
[2:17:20] <Lieutenant_America> Yeah that's what I'd assume, but the Gargs got them too
[2:17:23] <dukenux> This looks like you should use Dead Space's stasis on it
[2:17:31] <+Slimshazbot> @ryu_r as do controllers and the nihilanth
[2:17:48] <jorniev> if this was a race....
[2:17:51] <%Explodincatz> overlords
[2:17:56] <+Slimshazbot> @ryu_r but there's no evidence they're all the same species
[2:17:59] <+theKingRamses> they even float like overlords
[2:18:06] <Daxalog> Imagine if Zerg units went feral if there wasnt enough Observers or Overlords
[2:18:07] <dukenux> and the green stuff would be vespene gas
[2:18:13] <Daxalog> Fuck Id hate that
[2:18:26] <%BNPhone> yeah the grunts are not mutaded vorts
[2:18:30] <%natebud> Weird that the scientists never saw this factory, considering it has an exterior with smokestacks now
[2:18:37] <%derap41> Humans an Aliens both use vents its our common link
[2:18:47] <AppleBerryKitty> that so looks like a flash light
[2:18:51] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud They know where it is and are able to send shit, so I assume they do
[2:19:07] <Lieutenant_America> Heck, they'd HAVE to know if they got their hands on a live Grunt
[2:19:09] <+theKingRamses> @derap41 or we stole vents from them like the other things implied to be their tech
[2:19:13] <+Ryu_R> wiki says the vorts are in the same genus as the grunts
[2:19:17] <%BNPhone> I figure it's more the tracking deviced riddled thru the HEV suit @Lieutenant_America
[2:19:23] <+Slimshazbot> @lieutenant_america i assumed they were tracking the suit
[2:19:26] <jorniev> another point for the free man
[2:19:34] <Lieutenant_America> They'd still need to know about the Factory to get a living Grunt
[2:19:41] <zamzoph> Woolie not dead? PogChamp
[2:19:46] <%derap41> @theKingRamses Did we steal Duct tape too? I knew NASA couldn't be that clever

[2:28:04] <%natebud> I think woolie keeps right clicking the rocket like DOOM instead of aiming it
[2:28:04] <+bear_breaker20> use your keyblade
[2:28:10] <heartlesshealer> Won't bees just hit your guys when they get mind controlled?
[2:28:13] <+Goobbue> sv_cheats 1 god Kappa
[2:28:14] <dukenux> Hivehand is too weak against them
[2:28:16] <AppleBerryKitty> Chat, is this tuff or is woolie just not good, tell me.
[2:28:25] <+Ryu_R> both
[2:28:25] <OldOnyx> yes
[2:28:28] <%BNPhone> go down and it takes you up
[2:28:29] <Visorak6> both
[2:28:29] <+Fooguwu> both
[2:28:30] <AppleBerryKitty> both lol
[2:28:31] <akman14> Kill the Vords
[2:28:31] <AppleBerryKitty> ok
[2:28:33] <dukenux> both
[2:28:35] <%GraceTBM> this is a tough section, but it's playing to all of woolie's weaknesses
[2:28:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> It's both
[2:28:37] <%derap41> @AppleBerryKitty Yes
[2:28:40] <%GraceTBM> most of them at least
[2:28:42] <brian_peppers1> @appleberrykitty both
[2:28:47] <%BNPhone> Never kill the vorts you animal @akman14
[2:28:54] <pennykettle_> The visual clarity is also very low. Keep in mind this is all OC content so it will be different from the established gmae
[2:28:56] <oyyzzo> looks ez to me. just point and shoot
[2:28:56] <restingbones> omg Woolie, you just went through these vents. Go somewhere without Vortigons
[2:28:58] <%Irridium> hey man if they gotta go they gotta go
[2:29:01] <%natebud> Use the guided rocket
[2:29:01] <%BNPhone> through the vent takes you up
[2:29:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AppleBerryKitty A little of column a and little of column B
[2:29:12] <+bear_breaker20> if u say so woolz
[2:29:14] <AppleBerryKitty> alright thanks again, wanted ot make sure.
[2:29:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> But you have to hit them lol
[2:29:16] <%natebud> you have to guide it
[2:29:19] <Drchandragupta> They dodge guided rockets
[2:29:21] <%natebud> it's not a lock on
[2:29:27] <OldOnyx> NotLikeThis
[2:29:27] <Drchandragupta> They have a side dash
[2:29:35] <dukenux> guided rocket isn't made for tight space
[2:29:38] <dukenux> like this
[2:29:45] <skattikus> why is he using rockets on these guys lol
[2:29:50] <Melchior_the_Wise> every situation has the appropriate weapon
[2:29:50] <%GraceTBM> the guidance on the rocket gets fucked up by getting hit jerking the crosshair
[2:29:52] <heartlesshealer> unfortunately getting hit rocks Woolie so that throws off the rocket
[2:29:57] <%jepupu> Aim better, DPS harder
[2:29:57] <dipstere> Flinching fucks the rocket launcher so much
[2:29:58] <+bear_breaker20> @dukenux neither are you Kappa
[2:30:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Guided rockets wont work since Woolie cant track such a small target that accurately
[2:30:06] <NSFW_Nurgle> It's missing because you have to keep your cursor on a target until the rocket lands.
[2:30:13] <dukenux> damn
[2:30:13] <%derap41> Woolie having trouble shooting and moving at the same time
[2:30:16] <%BNPhone> Go through the vent on the platform where you reloaded all ur shit @WoolieVersus
[2:30:17] <+Ryu_R> let reggie try :)
[2:30:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:30:20] <dukenux> i got told
[2:30:23] <%lotharrio> At this point, I'd just look for anywhere to move forward to, in that open space.
[2:30:24] <+Fooguwu> SILENCE
[2:30:24] <HitchhikingThrough> Good luck Woolie!
[2:30:27] <%natebud> The only other option is to kill the Vorts
[2:30:30] <oyyzzo> woolie just let me connect remotely to your desktop Kappa
[2:30:33] <%GraceTBM> this is absolutely not woolie's fault on the rocket guidance, even a single hit will throw off the trajectory
[2:30:40] <brian_peppers1> Nihilath gon b good/bad
[2:30:46] <restingbones> Can you not simply go somewhere not directly next to the Vortigons, so you dont have to worry about them?
[2:30:49] <gamewarden92> Snarks are the only weapon left.
[2:30:51] <%GraceTBM> nihilanth is simpler than this if eel
[2:30:53] <gunsrlove> or eventually shotgun the slaves BibleThump
[2:30:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> Yeah, but he really shouldn't be using rockets in this situation
[2:30:59] <NSFW_Nurgle> @WoolieVersus It might take longer, but you should try using the Bee Gun, as it circumvents your aiming issues
[2:31:02] <+HaunchPaunch> Infinite ammo glitch!
[2:31:03] <dukenux> Good luck, we're all counting on you
[2:31:09] <%lotharrio> Lightside later is an option.

[2:31:59] <%Kriss1827> @solidus_113 but im at work tho
[2:32:03] <+Ryu_R> make sure you download the strive beta over a wired connection :_
[2:32:04] <%natebud> This is really a big difficulty spike, the rest of the game you can play almost effortlessly
[2:32:06] <+Slimshazbot> @gamewarden92 God mode is now selectable
[2:32:08] <%SirGO0SE> 1 woolieYE
[2:32:11] <dukenux> Fighting Gold is a grower

[2:32:32] <shamuzu> SourPls
[2:32:33] <dukenux> still... Bloody Stream the best
[2:32:36] <NSFW_Nurgle> Woolie's playing on easy, right?

[2:32:47] <zamzoph> AngelThump
[2:32:51] <NSFW_Nurgle> Ah
[2:32:57] <+linSP> fighting gold jp still my fave
[2:32:59] <EDFscout> normal is easiest difficulty.

[2:33:15] <%BNPhone> normal aka Black mesa or whatever they call it
[2:33:17] <unit24> was gone for a bit, what is woolie leaving to do?
[2:33:26] <%GraceTBM> didn't say
[2:33:32] <dukenux> is this theme of Woolie's childhood?
[2:33:36] <+PunJ0hn> backing down
[2:33:36] <Lieutenant_America> Yo Undertale music
[2:33:38] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[2:33:40] <+Fidranth> SourPls
[2:33:42] <%natebud> I think difficulty only changes enemy damage.
[2:33:54] <NSFW_Nurgle> I played the OG game on hard, so I've been a bit confused with the damage output
[2:34:32] <brian_peppers1> I expect Woolie to show up with all of the keyboards taped to him and if it's not that im gonna b dissapointed
[2:34:40] <NSFW_Nurgle> In OG half life, the shotgun sucked because it took like two or three shots to kill a vort
[2:34:56] <%BNPhone> a good right click would kill a vort
[2:35:00] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:35:27] <zamzoph> beep SourPls boop
[2:35:29] <%natebud> It takes two in this, but the shotgun has more range
[2:35:37] <+Ryu_R> ❤️ 🔫 🌻
[2:35:39] <NSFW_Nurgle> I remember you had to be touching a vort for the rightclick to kill
[2:35:46] <NSFW_Nurgle> @natebud ah
[2:35:50] <%derap41> Such a good track
[2:36:10] <+TimetodiveLTX> m-m-m-m-maybe it's the way you're dressed
[2:36:16] <%natebud> In OG half life you had to be way more precise with the shotgun.
[2:36:18] <+PunJ0hn> track is meh
[2:36:20] <%RioGascar> Damnit i over slept things
[2:36:20] <%BNPhone> generic wub wub bawkWeird

[2:36:59] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 51 minutes
[2:37:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> Considering Undertale came in 2015
[2:37:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> would be difficult to believe
[2:37:15] <Lieutenant_America> Time travel
[2:37:19] <Lieutenant_America> Michael J Fox did it again
[2:37:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:37:56] <Lieutenant_America> I played Undertale at the very start of college, that was 4.5 years ago.
[2:39:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> You think he can beat it this stream?
[2:39:35] <%natebud> Found out the other day that Bullsquids don't attack if you hold a barrel in front of their face.
[2:39:50] <%BNPhone> if he tries hard enough // doesnt end early he can beat it
[2:39:54] <+bear_breaker20> woolie wont beat it this stream no
[2:40:07] <+bear_breaker20> i dont believe
[2:40:09] <brian_peppers1> hes almost at the end
[2:40:10] <Melchior_the_Wise> He's not too far from the end
[2:40:19] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud That exploit will never die, I see
[2:40:29] <+bear_breaker20> i still dont believe
[2:40:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> But the next couple parts will be Tricky for woolie
[2:40:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> Until he’s trapped in this room for 3 hours
[2:40:36] <%BNPhone> Half Life 2 be like @natebud
[2:40:42] <Melchior_the_Wise> especially laser puzzle
[2:41:00] <brian_peppers1> 6 hour stream incoming...
[2:41:10] <Lieutenant_America> If this fight's giving him a time, the Elevator may be tricky even with Infinite Gluon Works

[2:41:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> Conveyor belt time

[2:43:48] <%natebud> Bullsquids act the same, but they're also turrets now, so they don't charge you
[2:44:01] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Really hoping they unfuck that
[2:44:21] <%natebud> that would be nice
[2:44:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:44:30] <Lieutenant_America> That one bit on Gonarch's Lair makes it seem like either a bug or something they're workshopping

[2:45:06] <dukenux> those love shack remixes kill me
[2:45:08] <@akuda_bar> this song cracks me up because it takes like two whole minutes to get to the punchline
[2:45:16] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Also I suspect 1.0 nerfed the Vorts' aim because I noticed that they're not as good as they were in pre-release.
[2:45:20] <+bear_breaker20> spanking intensifies with love shack*
[2:45:23] <a_mad_dragon> it's not the fatboy slim mashup though BibleThump
[2:45:23] <%jepupu> Guilty Gear Strive CBT soon
[2:45:24] <HitchhikingThrough> it's the best punchline though
[2:45:38] <dukenux> Or the one Neil Cicierega made
[2:45:47] <Lieutenant_America> Vorts were very accurate in Early Access, but they wiff more now
[2:46:07] <%arkv01> DANTE YOU CAN'T
[2:46:15] <@akuda_bar> here it comes
[2:46:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Tri´ple Q's greatest masterwork is Sucker don't @ me
[2:46:21] <dukenux> Also this is exactly the kind of music Dante would listen too
[2:46:31] <%BNPhone> 24 dragon magic is best
[2:46:34] <HitchhikingThrough> BANG BANG BANG
[2:46:41] <%natebud> I'm not sure. I remember being able to run circles around them before they had that ground attack
[2:46:51] <+Bane_Kaikyo> Triple-Q's Sucker is pretty great, wont lie
[2:46:55] <+bear_breaker20> this remix is SO trash lmao
[2:47:02] <+Fooguwu> it's awful lol
[2:47:04] <%BNPhone> it really do be tho
[2:47:12] <@akuda_bar> it's the longest windup for the least worthwhile punchline lmao
[2:47:29] <@Solidus_113> We'll reach the Lambda Labs in 4 hours at this rate!
[2:47:29] <dukenux> it's a setup for a joke
[2:47:41] <+Bane_Kaikyo> mashups aren't just jokes tho
[2:47:44] <@akuda_bar> We'll reach the Lambda Labs in 15 minutes at this rate!
[2:47:51] <dukenux> never said they were

[2:54:26] <jorniev> WOOLIE IS A D6
[2:54:27] <%derap41> Cause he keeps fixing things
[2:54:34] <ovan20> Woolies setup is the most confusing thing ever NotLikeThis
[2:54:51] <dukenux> wait is that a vent underneath, or is that where you came from
[2:54:55] <%arkv01> I love his setup, it gives me hope
[2:54:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Gosh darn gravity
[2:55:03] <%BNPhone> vent was used already
[2:55:15] <%BNPhone> nah you just missed
[2:55:16] <skattikus> i cant look at the camera cause his setup infuriates me. idk why
[2:55:16] <gunsrlove> Jump ledge
[2:55:19] <+theKingRamses> i think that's the way you came in?
[2:55:28] <gunsrlove> jump across the g ap
[2:55:28] <%derap41> Poor Freeman Went from a theoretical physicist to a space janitor
[2:55:32] <%BNPhone> thats the correct path
[2:55:45] <+therabbles> Do it for the Galunga

[2:57:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Fat Evil 2: Electric Boogaloo
[2:58:04] <+therabbles> was that a sequence break
[2:58:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Neji but he just touches the fat points in your body
[2:58:23] <+thenewjudas> just rewatched your ds1 play through love you wools
[2:58:28] <+Grayhammatter> BEEF UP
[2:58:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:58:40] <%purplehermit12> more health equals more crowbar time!
[2:58:43] <%purplehermit12> dont worry about it /s
[2:58:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ammo you say?
[2:58:49] <%derap41> Its like back when you started the game
[2:58:52] <FrostedZaibatsu> just throw the gun
[2:58:54] <Lieutenant_America> Soon ammo will be less of an issue
[2:58:55] <@Solidus_113> infinite bees
[2:58:59] <+theKingRamses> the bees won't ever leave you
[2:59:03] <Fenlig> ammo will not be a problem soon
[2:59:05] <%lotharrio> Infinite bee works.
[2:59:06] <+therabbles> release the bees
[2:59:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Aim better then
[2:59:12] <%natebud> This is a problem I see a lot in fan projects. The devs never know to give enough ammo.
[2:59:18] <%derap41> No CrowBar?
[2:59:21] <+Grayhammatter> BEES?!
[2:59:26] <%derap41> yeah Crowbar
[2:59:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @natebud No, there's planned pacing here
[2:59:33] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud You had ammo issues in this?
[2:59:38] <%jiggy_snipe> but you have good ole bar
[2:59:40] <dukenux> that looks like a puzzle
[2:59:46] <%BNPhone> I had no ammo through the majority oof BM Xen
[2:59:51] <%natebud> Not me, but woolie. He'
[2:59:52] <dukenux> nvm
[2:59:56] <%RioGascar> if I remember ammo trouble happened a lot
[3:00:00] <Lieutenant_America> You just said it
[3:00:02] <Lieutenant_America> Woolie
[3:00:07] <%arkv01> oh god my dota PTSD
[3:00:07] <%BNPhone> closer
[3:00:08] <%RioGascar> I ran out of ammo in beta versions of this
[3:00:16] <%natebud> He's playing this on easy remember and he's having dire ammo issues? That's not good design
[3:00:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @natebud His aim has never been the best.
[3:00:37] <skattikus> hes also a terrible shot tho hehe
[3:00:44] <%natebud> Easy
[3:00:48] <Lieutenant_America> One person having a problem does not equate "THIS MUST BE FIXED"
[3:00:49] <dukenux> wow
[3:00:51] <+Grayhammatter> EASY
[3:00:54] <HitchhikingThrough> god like
[3:00:57] <%derap41> Even Aliens use turbines
[3:01:00] <@Solidus_113> toooobs
[3:01:00] <Drchandragupta> Easy doesn't mean mindless
[3:01:02] <%purplehermit12> your in the TUBES
[3:01:06] <+Grayhammatter> OH

[3:01:18] <HitchhikingThrough> That's good
[3:01:19] <%BNPhone> monkaS
[3:01:22] <Lieutenant_America> I suck ass at RTS but that doesn't mean Brood War needs a complete rework

[3:01:24] <%derap41> You're swimming in GeneGoo
[3:01:24] <gunsrlove> Kreygasm
[3:01:33] <dukenux> BabyRage
[3:01:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Let em simmer
[3:01:39] <Drchandragupta> I will agree that this area's not very well designed and the worst part of xen even in black mesa
[3:01:42] <@Solidus_113> you contaminated that vat
[3:01:42] <%The_Timo> Marinate in goo
[3:01:45] <Drchandragupta> but that's not the issue here
[3:01:45] <%purplehermit12> now you're on the other side!
[3:01:45] <jorniev> getting close to that quake sequence
[3:01:53] <%RioGascar> Are you ready for a production line tour
[3:01:56] <%derap41> Born To die World is a fuck
[3:02:06] <jorniev> not you THE FREE AMN
[3:02:07] <dukenux> @Drchandragupta funny, it was the worst part of Half-Life too
[3:02:13] <+Grayhammatter> they hate it
[3:02:16] <%natebud> The original interloper was dumping ammo on you constantly, because you were supposed to be well equipped for the final chapter
[3:02:30] <+Bane_Kaikyo> GOO HURT
[3:02:31] <DSD24> Their suffering is nothing short of DIVINE
[3:02:33] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Now THAT was NOT my experience in OG Interloper
[3:02:37] <%BinaryFireball> I bet reggie is gonna buy a dope ass vespa with that blood pool money
[3:02:46] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:02:55] <%Balkespower> LASER PUZZLE
[3:03:00] <%natebud> You could also carry a lot more ammo in reserve @Lieutenant_America
[3:03:09] <+therabbles> Vortigaunts need to unionize
[3:03:12] <%derap41> Two Drones this time
[3:03:25] <%lotharrio> Making such strong choices with that jump dash.
[3:03:28] <Drchandragupta> That's not really a good thing tho. Ammo scarcity is a good mechanic but it can bite some people in the ass
[3:03:30] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Yeah and I remember being relatively low during OG Interloper
[3:03:35] <Kirby_Sauce> microwave hallway
[3:03:44] <Drchandragupta> It's a matter of adapting to the difference in tactics
[3:03:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Source platforming Kappa
[3:03:58] <@Solidus_113> use your walk button
[3:03:58] <%jepupu> Bit more FoV might help in cases like this.
[3:04:01] <%BNPhone> jotstick be like
[3:04:02] <+therabbles> in og xen you could bypass a lot of the areas from what i remember
[3:04:10] <+therabbles> i don't remember ammo scarcity being that much of a problem
[3:04:18] <%BNPhone> ah yes te fat evil
[3:04:18] <dukenux> bulge there
[3:04:19] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America I know when you reach Xen, it gets hard to find SMG ammo and shotgun shells, but you get tons of ammo for everything else
[3:04:20] <%lotharrio> I saw a fat evil
[3:04:22] <Klarrann3> how much easier would this be using a keyboard?
[3:04:24] <%RioGascar> It was also 1 hr long
[3:04:28] <%purplehermit12> Big FAT evil
[3:04:29] <dukenux> grenade?
[3:04:31] <%BNPhone> 500 iq
[3:04:35] <dukenux> yeyeye
[3:04:37] <+Grayhammatter> NICE
[3:04:43] <dukenux> aw fuck
[3:04:44] <+Grayhammatter> MORE FAT
[3:04:46] <@akuda_bar> it's the black mesa sweet voice
[3:04:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> MORE FAT
[3:04:51] <HitchhikingThrough> was THAT a sequence break?
[3:04:53] <%BNPhone> MORE FAT
[3:04:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BIG EVIL
[3:04:57] <%The_Timo> That couch can't handle anymore weight!
[3:05:04] <%derap41> Freeman Fixing more Pipes really the aliens aught to pay you at this point
[3:05:04] <Ashenik1> how mayn hours left ?
[3:05:12] <+therabbles> worst enemies in the game
[3:05:16] <%BNPhone> 1-1:30
[3:05:18] <Melchior_the_Wise> like 1 1/2 - 2
[3:05:19] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud If you're using Woolie's playthrough as empirical evidence, I get to use mine, and I was low on ammo during OG Interloper.
[3:05:20] <%RioGascar> its pretty hard to sequence break this section on purpose
[3:05:21] <gamewarden92> what happens if he just runs out of ammo?
[3:05:21] <%Tuna_Can_0> monkaS
[3:05:22] <Ashenik1> thx

[3:06:04] <%BNPhone> yup
[3:06:05] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America man, i just played through it, the ammo was being dropped pretty reguarly
[3:06:08] <+Grayhammatter> nice shot
[3:06:17] <%jiggy_snipe> nice rocket
[3:06:25] <%natebud> Woolie hasn't seen an ammo pickup since the sewers @Lieutenant_America
[3:06:29] <%BNPhone> ammu--what?
[3:06:38] <dukenux> Black Mesa boys been quiet lately
[3:06:39] <%Balkespower> no Ammo for you Woolie
[3:06:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> How long until the thing?
[3:06:45] <+theKingRamses> "he needs more snacks" - science team
[3:06:46] <+Grayhammatter> not a single ammo
[3:06:47] <%Balkespower> use your crowbar
[3:06:47] <+sagewuv> things outta stock?
[3:06:49] <AppleBerryKitty> We all know the feel of low ammo...(golden eye 64..)
[3:06:49] <%Balkespower> LUL
[3:06:51] <%RioGascar> Ammunition depleted
[3:06:51] <%BNPhone> the end of this area is the thing
[3:06:51] <CasualAlohaFriday> Praise the Lord and Pass the Bullets
[3:06:52] <MyNameIsRasus> It would be cool if coulld reflect the energy balls with the crowbar
[3:06:55] <dukenux> you could really use one of those care packages rn, right?
[3:06:59] <+Fooguwu> lord-passing tech
[3:07:00] <CarlTheBlind> woolie looks like hes piloting a mech
[3:07:00] <%Gruhunchously> Bullets aren't cheap, you know
[3:07:00] <%purplehermit12> just fly into them crowbar swinging
[3:07:02] <+sagewuv> supply chain a bit fucked?
[3:07:04] <%arkv01> you're tactically naked, woolz
[3:07:09] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Woolie burns through ammo like nuts
[3:07:09] <alrobot2014> naked with a full shotgun
[3:07:14] <%Balkespower> I had no ammo problems in this part
[3:07:17] <+PunJ0hn> naked on the toilet for comfort
[3:07:23] <alrobot2014> gordon gonna get hungy
[3:07:24] <%lotharrio> Keep your glucose up!
[3:07:26] <dukenux> KLEINEEER
[3:07:29] <%ChoculaUltra> its never a bad time for snacks to be fair
[3:07:36] <%Balkespower> but I had a better aim
[3:07:37] <Lieutenant_America> You're pointing to Woolie, but there's other people here going "I was good on ammo"
[3:07:37] <jorniev> I just realized this place is like the last level in half life 2
[3:07:37] <dukenux> LUL
[3:07:38] <+Bane_Kaikyo> gurdun hungy

[3:07:45] <+R0bobot> Gordon haven't eaten in over a day!
[3:07:47] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America But he's also playing on easy, so he shouldn't be having this much trouble when it was no problem for the entire game

[3:07:56] <dukenux> [Bring me to Life] psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[3:07:58] <%jepupu> Don't bees work on the floaties?
[3:07:59] <+Grayhammatter> just big gun ammo
[3:08:01] <@Solidus_113> NOW DON'T MISS
[3:08:04] <%Balkespower> Big Boy is what you need here
[3:08:11] <+therabbles> there is also the fact that you can just avoid a lot of encounters but woolie doesn't play like that
[3:08:19] <+Bane_Kaikyo> yeah I mean bees are infinite
[3:08:20] <%RioGascar> so I wonder if they do what valve actually does
[3:08:24] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud He also shouldn't have broken several setpieces
[3:08:32] <%natebud> That's the devs fault
[3:08:40] <HitchhikingThrough> is it tho
[3:08:40] <%RioGascar> And if its sections you SPECIFICALLY need ammo for to pass it infinitely spawns it
[3:08:46] <%Balkespower> I also killed every controller here and had no ammo problems
[3:08:48] <%ChoculaUltra> that's between the devs and god
[3:08:56] <Lieutenant_America> If DSP sucks at Metal Gear Solid, does that mean MGS is a bad game?
[3:09:03] <%BNPhone> Ah mr waterfalls
[3:09:05] <Drchandragupta> That's an interesting take nate, while I don't really agree I would like to hear your thoughts on why that's the dev's fault tho
[3:09:09] <@Solidus_113> factory bois
[3:09:12] <%Javaa01> It was an innocent mistake
[3:09:13] <%RioGascar> example for alyx you need to shoot a lock and if you use all your ammo the game will auto give you some ammo
[3:09:16] <Lieutenant_America> If Arin sucks at Sonic 3 and Knuckles, does that mean it sucks?
[3:09:17] <%Balkespower> oh
[3:09:18] <Drchandragupta> no sealioning geniuenly curious
[3:09:26] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:09:28] <+R0bobot> this is boppin
[3:09:34] <%natebud> @Drchandragupta That woolie keeps breaking highly scripted setpieces?
[3:09:37] <%Balkespower> almost at the part with infinite vacuum cleaner ammo
[3:09:44] <%Gruhunchously> Kind of forgot we were in Half Life for a second
[3:09:59] <+Bane_Kaikyo> how the fuck you forget you on an alien planet when the walls are covered in gooey flesh?
[3:10:07] <%RioGascar> Oh fuck this part
[3:10:11] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud He's done shit I've never seen once even in the Discussion forums that are full of breaks and bugs.
[3:10:13] <+R0bobot> beefight
[3:10:15] <pennykettle_> this doesnt look like half life, this is the end of Omikron
[3:10:17] <+Grayhammatter> bee FIGHT
[3:10:20] <%RioGascar> this fight sucks ass
[3:10:20] <Lieutenant_America> Spiders Georg is an outlier
[3:10:23] <%BNPhone> dont be afraid to spend your RPG they send it to you a lot
[3:10:27] <%GraceTBM> just run through this section double jumping
[3:10:29] <Lieutenant_America> Also I love this section
[3:10:30] <%Balkespower> Crossup with Gluon
[3:10:37] <Drchandragupta> This is the most bullshit section imo
[3:10:38] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America Is that autosave pit not his fault?
[3:10:43] <+R0bobot> I enjoy this fight with the energy weapons
[3:10:47] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud THAT is.
[3:10:54] <+R0bobot> get that big ammo
[3:11:01] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America No, it isn't.
[3:11:09] <castcola> what a phrase
[3:11:10] <Lieutenant_America> No I mean THAT was the devs
[3:11:10] <%BNPhone> ok thats just wrong @Lieutenant_America
[3:11:13] <Lieutenant_America> Mispeak
[3:11:17] <%BNPhone> ok my b
[3:11:20] <Lieutenant_America> Apologies for that one
[3:11:23] <@Solidus_113> back to Doom
[3:11:32] <gamewarden92> Frustration getting bigger
[3:11:34] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America What about him not triggering the music in the tank battle?
[3:11:35] <dukenux> this might be the last opportunity to use shootgun
[3:11:37] <%Balkespower> HIGH ON MORPHINE
[3:11:44] <%BinaryFireball> hahahaha
[3:11:49] <Drchandragupta> Was it though? I feel like that one was a pretty straightforward sequence that got foibled
[3:11:49] <%BinaryFireball> where the big bright light is
[3:11:52] <%SirGO0SE> PULL MY HALF LIFE TRIGGER
[3:12:00] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud He facefucked through an invisible wall to pass the sequence trigger
[3:12:00] <%jepupu> Woolie's sense of direction is legendary
[3:12:09] <@akuda_bar> he's like zoro, he never gets lost
[3:12:17] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America why didn't they just make the trigger area larger and not use an invisible wall?
[3:12:21] <%Balkespower> Bang! Bang! Bang! - Morphine administered
[3:12:35] <dukenux> Morhpine high is getting bigger

[3:12:46] <dukenux> Bang bang bang, pull my junkie trigger
[3:12:48] <@Solidus_113> he jumped over that low shotgun
[3:12:49] <%Irridium> that was RIGHT in the balls jesus
[3:12:50] <%Javaa01> It's kinda telling that Reggie without basically touching FPS games at all before the Doom LP is picking up on the directional cues better then Woolie is
[3:12:50] <%BNPhone> spend RPG
[3:12:54] <HitchhikingThrough> @natebud because obviously it never came up during any of the testing or feedback they recieved
[3:12:56] <%BNPhone> thats all they tp to you
[3:12:59] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie shoots people in the dick DansGame
[3:13:00] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Don't forget the never-ending ammo alien weapon works GREAT with the big boys
[3:13:00] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud I admit it's weird that they changed the entrance since in Early Access it was just an open door, but if no one else runs into this issue, then I consider that an outlier
[3:13:01] <%derap41> Gotta spend ammo to make ammo
[3:13:02] <%RioGascar> This guys give the least fucks
[3:13:08] <%Tuna_Can_0> time to crowbar FeelsGoodMan
[3:13:11] <dukenux> redistribute this ammo, comrade
[3:13:18] <jorniev> CROWBAR THEM
[3:13:28] <+therabbles> so then i started blastin
[3:13:29] <ManBoingo> woolie dual wielding input methods
[3:13:31] <Drchandragupta> Honestly @natebud I feel like that one specifically was Woolie not having certain FPS gamelogics internalized
[3:13:32] <Lieutenant_America> Again, DSP's experience does not decide what is wrong with a game's design
[3:13:52] <Drchandragupta> I could be wrong tho idk
[3:14:00] <%natebud> Woolie was trying to ump over a fence that you'd be able to jump over normally.
[3:14:09] <+R0bobot> all HEVy

[3:14:57] <Lieutenant_America> @This_is_Marco More of a general example. DSP always sucks at every game and goes "This game sucks and doesn;t tell me what to do"
[3:14:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT AMMO?
[3:15:01] <Drchandragupta> Obviously not everyone's gonna interanlize stuff the same way

[3:16:46] <skattikus> lol totally just didnt care
[3:16:46] <%Tuna_Can_0> SourPls
[3:16:47] <%RioGascar> This part is cool but man they now throw EVERYTHING they can
[3:16:48] <Lieutenant_America> Just climbed over a pile of meat without realizing
[3:16:50] <%derap41> Can't believe he missed the corpse hole
[3:16:51] <%Javaa01> That's where they keep the OSHA violations
[3:16:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> He missed the corpse pile
[3:16:56] <+theKingRamses> i thought that pile looked susupiciously like corpses
[3:16:58] <%lotharrio> Woolie's attitude did a 180 the moment infinite ammo came around.
[3:17:01] <Lieutenant_America> Is this Freeman's Mind

[3:17:50] <@akuda_bar> f-fuck a bullet?
[3:17:52] <+aishman> From this point forward, it's full of these magic crystals
[3:17:53] <+Pyroclase> This moment in Black Mesa with infinite ammo is inspired by an even sicker moment in HL2 I won't spoil
[3:18:03] <+aishman> So FUCK BULLETS
[3:18:05] <pennykettle_> Pyroclase I know what you mean
[3:18:09] <MyNameIsRasus> @akuda_bar EEEEEEENTER THE GUNGEON
[3:18:16] <HitchhikingThrough> Woolie I don't know about this stuff
[3:18:16] <%MaddyCaddy> Isn't that a spoiler just by saying that?
[3:18:18] <Lieutenant_America> @Pyroclase Eleventh Hour Superpowers are always awesome
[3:18:21] <+R0bobot> bro I straight up got stuck here lol
[3:18:23] <%purplehermit12> "look on the left" *looks right*
[3:18:24] <%RioGascar> Yes it is
[3:18:26] <%BinaryFireball> I feel like black mesa is more about Xen than the military base. I like it a lot
[3:18:31] <Daxalog> He- He said left knowing he would turn right
[3:18:33] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud holy hell, despite constant connection issues I created an account specifically to tell you that the game literally gave you an alien weapon with infinite ammo, why were you complaining about ammunition so badly?!
[3:18:33] <%RioGascar> it is massive spoilers saying that moment
[3:18:49] <%Vorga1339> @purplehermit12 that shit kills me every time I try to help somebody in a video game it happens why god
[3:19:00] <JacexDowozWideo> woolie will figure it out
[3:19:01] <skattikus> lol @disposableagent6362
[3:19:04] <%natebud> @disposableagent6362 it gave you infinite ammo for a setpiece
[3:19:08] <+Bane_Kaikyo> Woolie isn't even trying to speak vort with the proper intenuations
[3:19:16] <HitchhikingThrough> *woolie noises*
[3:19:18] <%derap41> @RioGascar Yup just saying that there is something is a spoiler even if you don't sayy what it is
[3:19:19] <MyNameIsRasus> @disposableagent6362 that's a lot of dedication
[3:19:21] <JacexDowozWideo> hmmmmm
[3:19:26] <+aishman> Oh but you will
[3:19:26] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud "Setpiece"
[3:19:29] <+aishman> GET READY FOR THE FACTORYYY
[3:19:30] <%jiggy_snipe> @natebud i think Woolie should use the bee gun more
[3:19:33] <%RioGascar> This is also where the game i find starts to get really unintuitive with its level layout
[3:19:34] <NSFW_Nurgle> Did that NASCAR driver also say "Galunga" when he thought he was alone?
[3:19:37] <%BNPhone> ah the interloper part of interloper
[3:19:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[3:19:48] <%Javaa01> What on earth could they possibly be producing in a factory that has a corpse pile of failed subjects
[3:19:48] <HitchhikingThrough> @RioGascar how bad is it gonna be for woolie
[3:19:49] <Lieutenant_America> Definitely not recurring
[3:19:55] <+R0bobot> green crystal equals energy weapon ammo
[3:19:56] <%Balkespower> Crouch jump
[3:19:58] <DisposableAgent6362> @Lieutenant_America I don't think it's even worth trying with this guy lol. Rip all that wasted time
[3:20:03] <+Grayhammatter> crouch jump?
[3:20:03] <pennykettle_> Did he go through this backwards?
[3:20:03] <+aishman> It is
[3:20:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Interloper reminds of Outer Wilds. God that game was amazing.
[3:20:09] <%RioGascar> It was pretty bad for most streamers so idk
[3:20:11] <desmond_whoa> He got the new set up.
[3:20:15] <%BNPhone> This part is TERRIBLE
[3:20:17] <%BNPhone> so yeah
[3:20:23] <@Solidus_113> Woolie, you never have to crouch manually
[3:20:29] <+Deko_> LUL
[3:20:29] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:20:35] <%derap41> Crazy talk wait what
[3:20:42] <%Javaa01> It's because of Woolie's ungodly control layout
[3:20:43] <+facenorway> facefucking the wall when you jump is not good
[3:20:52] <gunsrlove> Black Mesa just doesn't like controllers
[3:20:54] <%Javaa01> If you just do it normally it works just fine
[3:21:05] <%Tuna_Can_0> I feel that way about doors you have to wait for to open. Getting softlocked once makes me paranoid
[3:21:08] <%Javaa01> That's Quality Control
[3:21:09] <%Balkespower> DISCARDED
[3:21:16] <%BinaryFireball> sure do love them boxes
[3:21:18] <gamewarden92> meat
[3:21:20] <JacexDowozWideo> that's a big video game right here
[3:21:20] <+R0bobot> open one
[3:21:21] <%derap41> Soylent Green?
[3:21:22] <Lieutenant_America> Contaminated product

[3:22:49] <@Solidus_113> yes
[3:22:50] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud It even work under water as you see + has a rapid fire.
[3:22:52] <%Javaa01> Well yeah, they prefer to hang around radioactive shitpits
[3:22:52] <%Balkespower> if you mean the Gonarch, yes
[3:22:55] <%Javaa01> And this is a shitpit
[3:22:55] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud works*
[3:23:07] <JacexDowozWideo> ok, I've got some catching up to do
[3:23:07] <%BinaryFireball> why was gordon freeman never in smash?
[3:23:16] <%natebud> Just use the bee gun, who'd want to use half your arsenal
[3:23:19] <%lotharrio> Never on a Nintendo system.
[3:23:25] <%BinaryFireball> oh
[3:23:25] <%purplehermit12> Thatr doesnt matter @lotharrio
[3:23:31] <%BNPhone> woolie back to killing everything instead of just leaving
[3:23:31] <%purplehermit12> Joker and Cloud werent either
[3:23:38] <%RioGascar> I dont even think valve would actually care if any one of their games were in smash
[3:23:44] <gunsrlove> GET WASPED
[3:23:47] <%natebud> Man, fish are useless in this game
[3:23:51] <%RioGascar> like sure i guess you can put gordon in
[3:23:51] <%BinaryFireball> he would be a great character
[3:23:58] <@Solidus_113> back to puzzle platforming
[3:24:03] <%lotharrio> Cloud was in.... some bullshit minigame spinoff. Joker was too I think.

[3:25:14] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Why are you watching if you don't like anything about this game? Like, I'm not even talking about Interloper specifically; I know I'm in the minority opinion about Xen here. You don't seem to like any of the changes here.
[3:25:15] <%Tuna_Can_0> Vortigaunts are the best :)
[3:25:17] <pennykettle_> This is exactly what old xen was
[3:25:27] <%SirGO0SE> friendly, soft spoken, whispered r's
[3:25:28] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America I enjoy the sequence breaking
[3:25:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> galumger is our word. you can say galumga tho
[3:25:29] <%derap41> This is old Zen
[3:25:30] <Daxalog> Some parts of this was in the original
[3:25:34] <%nothuzad> vortigaunts are adorable friends
[3:25:37] <@Solidus_113> It's closer to HL2 design
[3:25:38] <JacexDowozWideo> the cardboard box factory tho is like pure 90's and I'm not sure if I like it
[3:25:40] <skattikus> not even in the new part LUL
[3:25:41] <%RioGascar> This xen needs half life 2 idea to exist
[3:25:51] <%Javaa01> PCs in 98 would run out of memory trying to handle areas this big
[3:25:53] <dukenux> those barrel and delivery belts section was in the old Xen yes
[3:25:58] <+Pyroclase> there was a level very similar to this in HL1, but they added a lot more game design here
[3:25:58] <zanzibarian_hamster> Old zen is an unfinished mess anyhow, this is like a loose remake
[3:26:01] <zocano> It’s similar but not exactly like old Xen
[3:26:03] <%RioGascar> hell it takes puzzles and design straight up from half life 2 things
[3:26:08] <+theKingRamses> honestly this kinda looks like the original prey more to me
[3:26:08] <Lieutenant_America> This part is more directly lifted from OG Xen
[3:26:09] <+Pyroclase> this are has puzzles where the original was pretty much pure platforming
[3:26:11] <+R0bobot> chase was new
[3:26:18] <Daxalog> The forest part WAS the big new thing. This is just the old factory xen expanded
[3:26:18] <%BNPhone> yeah all that shit was new but this section is pretty recycled
[3:26:19] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud They had another one after "Forget about Freeman" ? What did I miss?
[3:26:19] <JacexDowozWideo> is there anything more video game than boxes on conveyor belts?
[3:26:20] <+R0bobot> factory is old
[3:26:23] <+Fooguwu> not if you stop running first
[3:26:24] <+R0bobot> remixed rather
[3:26:28] <%Vorga1339> !!! MOMENTUM LOST !!!
[3:26:35] <%RioGascar> And made “better”
[3:26:36] <%Javaa01> This factory existed in the original Xen, but they were tiny in scope compared to the industrial areas of this version of Xen
[3:26:37] <%XxPatchworkxX> Woolie pls
[3:26:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:26:39] <%nothuzad> JacexDowozWideo swords
[3:26:42] <%XxPatchworkxX> lol
[3:26:44] <Lieutenant_America> @R0bobot The Garg chase is technically in OG Xen
[3:26:47] <%BNPhone> !! MOMENTUM AT RISK !!
[3:26:49] <%natebud> @disposableagent6362 Did you see woolie get caught in an endless autosave death loop?
[3:26:53] <%RioGascar> The tiny scope made it more bearable
[3:26:54] <%Gruhunchously> Half Life was among the first games to have set-pieces like that.
[3:27:03] <%RioGascar> this just goes on and on and on and on
[3:27:11] <zocano> Old Xen factory is kind of a slog anyway
[3:27:15] <%Tuna_Can_0> @natebud LUL that sounds amazing when was that?
[3:27:19] <%BNPhone> old xen factory is 2 seconds long
[3:27:19] <+Fooguwu> woolie the jump master
[3:27:29] <zocano> It’s still a slog
[3:27:32] <gunsrlove> Double You, Ay, Ess, Dee
[3:27:32] <Lieutenant_America> @xx123manxx Now THAT is not true
[3:27:39] <JacexDowozWideo> so is woolie going to play HL2 next?
[3:27:42] <%derap41> Momentum gone
[3:27:43] <%natebud> @This_is_Marco he fell in a pit and the game autosaved right before he died. It was the final jump from the gargantuan chase
[3:27:46] <zocano> Especially on Hard
[3:27:50] <+Fooguwu> woolie stops walking right before he jumps every time
[3:27:51] <Fenlig> I did not enjoy the gameplay of new zen
[3:27:51] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud Nope, but sounds fun) Did it happen last stream, cuz I wasn't present and haven't watched it yet
[3:27:52] <+Pyroclase> at this rate you should bind quicksave and load to the mouse
[3:27:57] <%BNPhone> you can blow thorugh it in <10 minutes
[3:27:58] <+therabbles> super mario world momentum
[3:28:02] <gunsrlove> It's not the geometry
[3:28:07] <%Balkespower> follow the pipe
[3:28:12] <@Solidus_113> I think what's happening is there are too many inputs happening at once, so the computer is dropping them all, like when you press multiple keyboard keys at the same time
[3:28:16] <%Tuna_Can_0> @natebud LUL how long ago roughly?
[3:28:17] <+mythboy99> the learned skill is called platforming
[3:28:17] <%natebud> @disposableagent6362 No, it was just now
[3:28:19] <zocano> Not on a first playthrough on hard
[3:28:29] <pennykettle_> I think the floor is angled so when you jump its angling the jump to the left and you hit the pipe
[3:28:30] <%Javaa01> Basically, your control layout is fucking you
[3:28:31] <%natebud> @disposableagent6362 maybe an hour ago
[3:28:33] <zocano> It’s a combat slog in ways the rest of the game isn’t
[3:28:36] <+aishman> Follow the piiipe
[3:28:37] <%saltpiggu> the secret is to use a keyboard
[3:28:40] <%Tuna_Can_0> ah ty
[3:28:43] <%saltpiggu> that was a joke
[3:28:48] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud Will make sure to check it out. I bet it is was hilarious xd
[3:28:48] <%BinaryFireball> no
[3:28:48] <JacexDowozWideo> the presumed landing zone isn't coded in any visual way either
[3:28:51] <+Nanani1990> how about your wierdo hybrid setup woolie, think about that
[3:28:53] <%RioGascar> Theres 2 different input schemes goin on and your lucky it even is reading both inputs
[3:28:54] <%chiluzza> nope
[3:28:56] <+Grayhammatter> nope
[3:28:58] <+Nanani1990> *weirdo
[3:28:58] <+Pyroclase> A MEAT PIPE
[3:28:59] <shamuzu> could the cursed setup be fucking up with the jumps?
[3:29:06] <%Balkespower> to your left
[3:29:09] <%BNPhone> ez
[3:29:10] <%natebud> @disposableagent6362 It's pretty good
[3:29:13] <%Balkespower> oh yeah
[3:29:13] <+theKingRamses> save?
[3:29:15] <+Pyroclase> teleporter checkpoints
[3:29:18] <%Vorga1339> I don't want to beat a dead horse but you might have an overlapping bind that kills the momentum. Maybe something else is also bound to jump, or maybe the autocrouchjump kills the momentum. Just spitballing.
[3:29:21] <%Balkespower> that was the intended path
[3:29:26] <+R0bobot> this is really a problem with auto sprint, or possibly control setup. Anecdotal evidence, but I experienced none of the jump issues on a Keyboard and mouse.
[3:29:32] <dukenux> so you were supposed to exit from this
[3:29:33] <+Sleix_> @solidus_113 I don't know if that's right. That's a very keyboard-specific hardware flaw.
[3:29:33] <%Balkespower> nvm me I am dumb
[3:29:36] <%Javaa01> Those teleporters are checkpoints in case you fall off
[3:29:38] <+therabbles> i think its that he just forgets to hold the stick forward when doing the jumps
[3:29:42] <EDFscout> could be the stick rather than keyboard
[3:29:48] <%RioGascar> Im gonna give all the leeway in the world here
[3:29:55] <%RioGascar> Cause this part is shit
[3:30:01] <%RioGascar> its layout sucks
[3:30:12] <EDFscout> YE
[3:30:16] <zocano> It’s not great in HL1 either
[3:30:18] <+Grayhammatter> oh no

[3:30:28] <%natebud> just go i guess LUL
[3:30:30] <%Javaa01> @Sleix_ Source emulates controller and analogue input, it doesn't use direct input APIs
[3:30:31] <%BNPhone> ez

[3:30:45] <%derap41> Beat Saber time
[3:30:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> Lets see how long this takes
[3:30:51] <+Fooguwu> woolie hurts, and then he sees
[3:30:53] <%XxPatchworkxX> why does he just jump straight up instead of forward and dash?
[3:30:54] <%BinaryFireball> oh no this jump
[3:31:00] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:31:01] <dukenux> not like that
[3:31:02] <%BinaryFireball> oh noooooo
[3:31:06] <JacexDowozWideo> an Indian Jones death trap that embarrasses you instead of killing you
[3:31:07] <%Javaa01> Jump to the next box
[3:31:07] <%BinaryFireball> I knew it
[3:31:07] <%RioGascar> look at this video game shit
[3:31:08] <@akuda_bar> botch
[3:31:08] <+Grayhammatter> big wipeouts
[3:31:11] <+Pyroclase> yeah this section sucks
[3:31:12] <pennykettle_> thats a bad jump puzzle
[3:31:17] <%lotharrio> ...safer just to take that last hit.
[3:31:18] <dukenux> okay, atleast this time you wont lose half you health
[3:31:21] <@Solidus_113> you really didn't need to do an air dash there
[3:31:21] <jorniev> squis
[3:31:23] <+theKingRamses> or just hurdle your crate
[3:31:24] <jorniev> h
[3:31:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> do not use the air dash
[3:31:28] <Fenlig> you don't
[3:31:29] <%derap41> Or just tank the damage
[3:31:29] <@akuda_bar> osha says this is fine
[3:31:34] <EDFscout> you need some SHARP moves in this
[3:31:42] <%BNPhone> it's easier to crouch jump that on KBM can you not just sit in it and take minimal damage
[3:31:50] <%RioGascar> I say fuck it
[3:31:52] <jorniev> reminds me of portal
[3:31:53] <%RioGascar> Just take the damage
[3:31:54] <+Deko_> monkaS
[3:31:54] <%XxPatchworkxX> just jump and hold forward dude. stop over thinking it
[3:31:55] <+30darke> Just tank it

[3:32:55] <%Balkespower> this part felt unnecessary for me
[3:33:01] <+Sleix_> @javaa01 The specifc issue with keyboards is a hardware thing. Software doesn't limit it afaik. There are keyboards that exist where you can press any number of keys at once and it'll recognize them.
[3:33:17] <%Javaa01> This is not an Nkey rollover issue

[3:33:29] <gamewarden92> Why would the make another factory level?

[3:39:33] <%natebud> That was a bug back in Blue Shift, so at least it's authentic
[3:39:42] <%Memdosu> is the controller resting on the trigger?
[3:39:43] <DisposableAgent6362> @JacexDowozWideo Exactly my thoughts!
[3:39:46] <Daxalog> When that happens have you tried pressing or holding down the shoot buttons then releasing?
[3:39:51] <%Gruhunchously> They ported the bugs over to a new engine huh.
[3:39:52] <cero_5> Does firing while it's going off not do anything? Whenever I've run into that bug that fixed it

[3:42:10] <%prime_name> The game is spooked!
[3:42:12] <HitchhikingThrough> USE A MOUSE AND KEYBOARD
[3:42:12] <+Pyroclase> This eems like an input problem
[3:42:13] <%Balkespower> just equip the crowbar
[3:42:13] <+Nanani1990> the game is rejecting your setup
[3:42:13] <%natebud> switch to crowbar LUL @WoolieVersus
[3:42:14] <Parapattern> So I started BLASTING
[3:42:14] <+therabbles> crowbar out
[3:42:16] <+Deko_> gordon panicked and started shooting LUL
[3:42:16] <silverira> Freeman is nervous
[3:42:16] <+waltzqueen> DEVIL GAMES
[3:42:16] <%XxPatchworkxX> just turn off the controller
[3:42:18] <ovan20> thi setup is actially sabotaging the game LUL
[3:42:18] <valtarax> woolie is playing controller and mouse?
[3:42:18] <dukenux> Whatever opened that window, possesed the game
[3:42:18] <akman14> Try shooting?
[3:42:21] <EDFscout> The fuck honestly
[3:42:22] <+sund0wner> Yeahhhhh...
[3:42:22] <$arcielardor> LUL
[3:42:23] <Lieutenant_America> All of creation is conspiring against Woolie
[3:42:25] <%Javaa01> This is your punishment for controller based heresy
[3:42:26] <cero_5> so no buttons do anything in that state?
[3:42:28] <+R0bobot> what is going on
[3:42:31] <@Solidus_113> Ghosts of your bad controls
[3:42:35] <%lotharrio> Turns out, we didn't know what we were messing with.
[3:42:35] <TigerClaws12> SOURCE GHOST
[3:42:36] <%BNPhone> controller setup be like
[3:42:38] <shamuzu> "use the fucking keyboard" -black mesa 2020
[3:42:39] <%Balkespower> I AM REJECTING YOUR SETUP @WoolieVersus
[3:42:40] <dukenux> atleast you're close to the end... I THINK
[3:42:40] <thelivingglitch307> corona computer virus
[3:42:40] <+sund0wner> It's bleeding into even the indoor facets of life WE ARE NOT SAFE
[3:42:42] <%XxPatchworkxX> wait that doesn't make sense right? is the controller messed up?
[3:42:47] <jorniev> THATS THE G MAN'S DOING
[3:42:58] <+earthwormjesse> He’s walking with a controller and shooting with a mouse, right?
[3:43:02] <%Irridium> "use a keyboard" y'all shoot with the keyboard?
[3:43:07] <Drchandragupta> @EarthwormJim94 yeah
[3:43:09] <+mythboy99> These damn games and their inability to conform to The Hybrid.
[3:43:09] <+sund0wner> @EarthwormJim94 Yerp
[3:43:17] <JacexDowozWideo> hi Reggie!
[3:43:21] <%chiluzza> the computer itself rejects the hybrid
[3:43:33] <%lotharrio> It's just Black Mesa being afraid of your Mongolian style control setup and the Cube.
[3:43:34] <$arcielardor> is something sitting on the keyboard, Woolie?
[3:43:34] <%chiluzza> they hybrid screams to kill it yet woolie keeps it on life support
[3:43:34] <%BNPhone> hi
[3:43:36] <+sund0wner> Hello Reggie!
[3:43:37] <fantaam1> Damn reggie sits down like an old man Kappa
[3:43:40] <dukenux> Hi Reggie
[3:43:44] <+R0bobot> big weird
[3:43:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> Only 3
[3:43:48] <gunsrlove> It's the controller
[3:44:00] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus did this happen before you started using the hybrid?
[3:44:05] <%natebud> Might just be woolie's controller. I've had that happen with old controllers
[3:44:06] <HitchhikingThrough> not trolling
[3:44:09] <%derap41> Game falling apart at the seams
[3:44:09] <HitchhikingThrough> legit curious
[3:44:11] <+R0bobot> woolieTRASH
[3:44:12] <%RioGascar> i mean its 2 entire different inputs. i know call of duty makes it so only 1 input mode is accepted and if you turn on gamepad it requires a whole restart
[3:44:13] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is it normal for QA to try hybrid method?
[3:44:13] <PsychedelicSnake> We can see your covid porn in the reflection
[3:44:18] <%BNPhone> we meme about it constantly but it is probably actually the hybrids fault
[3:44:23] <thelivingglitch307> that reminds me some competitive Fortnite player made a mouse with trigger and joystick on the side
[3:44:26] <AxelCezar> bitterDab bitterDab
[3:44:31] <Visorak6> Is Interloper hurting your final thoughts on the game?
[3:44:39] <%Javaa01> Also, NES games had a hard limit on size
[3:44:39] <+earthwormjesse> Are you bumping the trigger on the controller and then moving the mouse, leaving the trigger input stuck on?
[3:44:50] <%agumon9000> Look Gordon! A rope!
[3:44:53] <%BinaryFireball> HL2 is poop
[3:44:55] <%agumon9000> :)
[3:44:55] <%BinaryFireball> fight me
[3:44:56] <%Balkespower> How do you like Interloper so far?
[3:45:03] <@Solidus_113> you'll get a speech
[3:45:03] <Lieutenant_America> Kinda?
[3:45:04] <unit24> please god don't play it with mmod or whatever
[3:45:04] <DisposableAgent6362> I hope they would to use MMOD for their HL2 playthrough tho!
[3:45:07] <dukenux> HL2 is gud
[3:45:10] <%natebud> HL2 is good, but it's slooooooooooooow
[3:45:11] <EDFscout> @Binary_Fireball catch these hands
[3:45:15] <%BNPhone> no @disposableagent6362
[3:45:18] <%Balkespower> You can paly HL2 Vanilla, HL2 Update or the MMOD
[3:45:20] <unit24> mmod is cool for a replay
[3:45:21] <Lieutenant_America> HL2 Update is worth it at least
[3:45:22] <+Pyroclase> Half-Life 2 has largely its own story actually, but a few jokes only work if you played HL1
[3:45:30] <DisposableAgent6362> @xx123manxx Care to explain why not?
[3:45:30] <Drchandragupta> Man while this level is pretty bad you are having a shit ton more difficulty with it lmao. I'm guessing it's the stream tax
[3:45:32] <+thebeargoesHONK> going to play Alyx first or straight to Half-Life 2?
[3:45:33] <unit24> first playthrough should be vanilla or update
[3:45:34] <@Solidus_113> woolieCHAN
[3:45:37] <DisposableAgent6362> @xx123manxx Literally no downside lmao
[3:45:41] <%SirGO0SE> woolieYE woolieYE
[3:45:49] <Drchandragupta> Low key bugs are part of the stream/LP tax somehow
[3:45:54] <%RioGascar> play half life 2 and its episodes before alyx
[3:45:55] <DisposableAgent6362> @Balkespower Or Update with MMOD
[3:45:56] <pennykettle_> LUL
[3:45:59] <+Deko_> LUL
[3:46:00] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:46:04] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:46:06] <+VietcongSamurai> LUL
[3:46:13] <unit24> original HL2 is totally fine, it doesn't need a combat overhaul, it's just a cool thing to have if you're already familiar
[3:46:13] <%purplehermit12> yo its fucking a flex to try and advertise a podcast on another podcast
[3:46:14] <%ChoculaUltra> bold.
[3:46:18] <%Balkespower> @disposableagent6362 that's the best option
[3:46:21] <%ChoculaUltra> very very bold.
[3:46:24] <+Pyroclase> I didn't know you guys had advertising agents, that's super interesting
[3:46:31] <%Prevot> LUL
[3:46:32] <DisposableAgent6362> @unit24 That's a negative, sir! If you can enhance the experience without drastically changing it, then you should use it!
[3:46:32] <%BNPhone> Why would you not play vanilla on your first playthrough? those stupid mods are to just add additional shit for extra playthroughs
[3:46:36] <%RioGascar> So rooster teeth
[3:46:49] <+sund0wner> Ahhhhh
[3:46:54] <JacexDowozWideo> I wouldn't recommend MMOD, one of the devs is a nut job, wanted to see Christchurch shooting sounds to the mod. there are some leaked discord messages on the net
[3:47:01] <%arkv01> the roost mafia
[3:47:06] <unit24> changing the way combat works is drastically changing it
[3:47:10] <%BNPhone> ^
[3:47:16] <dukenux> question is, would MMOD ensure jank like we've seen during these streams
[3:47:17] <%Javaa01> Yeah, HL2 vanilla is a fine experience, or even HL2 Update, if you want slightly nicer looking environment lighting
[3:47:26] <HitchhikingThrough> So what you're saying you AGREED to shill Inhumans?
[3:47:29] <skattikus> i didnt realize you guys were still with rooster teeth
[3:47:29] <DisposableAgent6362> @xx123manxx @unit24 Wow, so many vanilla bois here..
[3:47:31] <dukenux> i'd stick to official releases for LP purposes
[3:47:36] <%RioGascar> half life 2 vanilla still holds up
[3:47:38] <%arkv01> nice guys, those roost boys
[3:47:40] <%natebud> This man knows
[3:47:49] <JacexDowozWideo> Wolie

[3:48:02] <@Solidus_113> it'll be 40 hours by the end
[3:48:04] <DisposableAgent6362> @JacexDowozWideo Well that's some news. Still I personally would care, it's not like I'm paying the devs, I'm freely using their work to enhance my experience.
[3:48:04] <%jiggy_snipe> Wolie Kappa
[3:48:05] <HitchhikingThrough> that's a big game, that's absurd
[3:48:08] <JacexDowozWideo> I love Wolie and Regi
[3:48:12] <DisposableAgent6362> @JacexDowozWideo wouldn't*
[3:48:12] <%derap41> Even at 12 hour a day no way

[3:48:32] <@Menitta> COOP
[3:48:33] <@Solidus_113> Portal 2 Coop
[3:48:33] <dukenux> Portal 2 has a coop
[3:48:34] <+Pyroclase> highest rated game on steam, actually

[3:48:36] <%steelmorrigan> Tell that to the 9 hour speedrun that ESA did
[3:48:36] <+Deadpal> Portal 2 Co-op.
[3:48:38] <alrobot2014> portal 2 co-op is a wild ride
[3:48:39] <@Menitta> oh my god Portal 2 Coop

[3:48:46] <%emeraldskrull> say yes we need more reggie woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:48:47] <%Balkespower> Portal 2Co-op
[3:48:48] <Visorak6> portal 2 co-op is a really fun break game
[3:48:48] <%arkv01> ehhh maybe, more games to play lads
[3:48:49] <DatAsuna> Co-op is fun but it's own hing
[3:48:49] <dukenux> Did Reggie not play Portal 2?
[3:48:49] <%Balkespower> oh yeah
[3:48:50] <%purplehermit12> if anything if reggies in the drivers seat and you're in the passenger it should go smoothly
[3:48:50] <%derap41> Banner Lord 2 When?
[3:48:51] <%RioGascar> portal 2 coop is fun
[3:48:51] <pennykettle_> Puzzle games are youtube cancer. It physically hurts to watch someone not understand a portal puzzle
[3:49:02] <JacexDowozWideo> maybe after HL2?
[3:49:08] <+waltzqueen> hard maybe- soft no
[3:49:09] <+Pyroclase> Portal 2 tried so hard to sell the co-op, but people only ever talk about singleplayer
[3:49:10] <dukenux> It's a definite maybe
[3:49:11] <VJdarkworld> half life 3 coop mangoReally
[3:49:12] <+Sparkmanexe> @WoolieVersus please play yugioh
[3:49:20] <%derap41> it works with a controller too
[3:49:21] <DisposableAgent6362> Eh, it's not worth trying. Too many people here hating MMOD for slightest reasons. I didn't even recommend CM, lmao
[3:49:22] <+theKingRamses> the portal 2 coop is amazing
[3:49:23] <+Pyroclase> You play as Chell in Portal 2 as well
[3:49:24] <%Javaa01> @Balkespower I don't mind sprint being limited in HL2's combat sandbox, but flashlight being a separate meter is a fantastic change
[3:49:24] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Have you tried using gyro-aiming with the Switch Pro-Controller for FPS games?
[3:49:24] <%chiluzza> what
[3:49:24] <+Deadpal> for the co-op
[3:49:26] <%RioGascar> Maybe a puzzle bois thing?
[3:49:28] <+Deadpal> For the Sp it's still chell
[3:49:30] <%BNPhone> thats for coop only
[3:49:30] <%chiluzza> you play as chell in portal 2
[3:49:33] <DatAsuna> Only in co-op you're still chel in campaign
[3:49:35] <%chiluzza> the co op is the two robots
[3:49:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> PORTAL 2 IS CHELL. ROBOTS ARE A BONUS CAMPAIGN
[3:49:37] <akman14> CRAZY TALK
[3:49:39] <MyNameIsRasus> You also play as Chel in 2 tho
[3:49:44] <%Double_Tap_That> Double_Tap_That subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Have you seen the new XCOM game? Now the aliens are your friends, so you DON'T have to sell out humanity for a jetpack.

[3:49:50] <%RioGascar> valve said they could not do coop due to how complex it would get
[3:49:50] <%ozzrabbit> I sell bitch in your heart Woolie, play the Portal Games.

[3:55:14] <%RioGascar> do not play alyx after black mesa

[3:55:18] <+HypestMoose> Woolies a Blue player D:
[3:55:24] <masterfire23> yeah alyx has spoilers
[3:55:27] <%RioGascar> wait for beating half life 2 and its episodes

[3:56:40] <Lieutenant_America> Playing with killers
[3:56:42] <JacexDowozWideo> the official best way to play the Half-Life series is to play the first one LAST so the whole time you go through HL2 and the episodes you can be like "ooh boy I wonder who is responsible for THAT blunder"
[3:56:42] <Daxalog> Your all using the same deck iits all trash
[3:56:43] <%derap41> Black Mesa running this strat
[3:56:44] <%arkv01> @SoushinSen meet woolie in teppan and do it to him

[3:57:25] <%natebud> "When i get my hands on the guy who started all this..." @JacexDowozWideo

[3:57:48] <+Slimshazbot> God Prey 2017 is soooooo goooooooood
[3:57:49] <%Balkespower> you should try Serious Sam some time in the far future
[3:57:51] <+some_brave_apollo> have to say, Black Mesa Xen seems a lot longer and more involved than I remember the original being
[3:57:55] <%Balkespower> that will hone your reflexes

[4:02:12] <%BNPhone> your mothers vag might as well be a vent
[4:02:16] <JacexDowozWideo> @disposableagent6362 it looks like valve just completely ignored everything that got leaked with HL2 beta and didn't go through into the full game. Cremators are fucking goooone. I remember Gabe saying that the leak was a bad morale hit for the whole team, maybe that's why they just don't acknowledge any of that content
[4:02:19] <Drchandragupta> It's just a bad level

[4:02:51] <%derap41> Ahh! naked grunts
[4:02:53] <%RioGascar> The half life 2 beta that was publically leaked is mostly the retail game
[4:03:10] <jorniev> DR BEES
[4:03:10] <Nero_Cross> and here's the moment I noclip'd for the rest of interloper

[4:03:22] <DisposableAgent6362> @JacexDowozWideo Nah, that's just what they used as an excuse, pathetic excuse. The changes begone long before that leak. It's thanks to that leak we received some info.

[4:04:48] <%RioGascar> Uh
[4:04:49] <%RioGascar> No
[4:04:50] <dukenux> @Javaa01 weird, that ammo count showed 96
[4:04:51] <DisposableAgent6362> @RioGascar No, it's not. Many things were not realised. Completely different story, locations, characters and enemies. I just despise HL2's lack of enemies. So much synth type of enemies were just removed.
[4:04:51] <%derap41> Might have broken something
[4:04:53] <%arkv01> @stumpynolegsMD next stage of human evolution

[4:05:10] <%derap41> Yeah you is not a game area
[4:05:21] <%natebud> It's fine woolie, they gave you infinite ammo an hour ago.
[4:05:22] <@Solidus_113> tester powers
[4:05:26] <major_gnuisance> @stumpynolegsMD because he can't into keyboard controls and didn't follow my advice of using a PS4 controller for gyro aiming

[4:05:50] <%Balkespower> How did you manage to get there, Woolie?
[4:05:51] <dukenux> nope
[4:05:51] <%BNPhone> Controllers break the game
[4:05:51] <PsychedelicSnake> Woolie is using Paige levels of level breakage
[4:05:51] <%arkv01> fuckery with a capital K
[4:05:55] <+Pyroclase> This specific area is honestly the weakest of the whole game
[4:05:56] <Melchior_the_Wise> Woolie you broke this game so hard
[4:06:02] <%agumon9000> This is why you don't play with controller!
[4:06:04] <+R0bobot> borked
[4:06:04] <dukenux> Is this the curse of QA?
[4:06:11] <%insomniacCoder> clipped
[4:06:13] <DisposableAgent6362> @JacexDowozWideo I mean HL2 didn't even have Xen & other alien infestation unlike Alyx, so it's possible they could be presented in another game.
[4:06:13] <%derap41> Sourced
[4:06:14] <JacexDowozWideo> this isn't the right time to activate the QA stand
[4:06:22] <Lieutenant_America> "You've entered the range of my Stand"
[4:06:23] <+Grayhammatter> sourced
[4:06:24] <+AsinPersuasion> people payed for this in 2020?
[4:06:24] <%Balkespower> Man Crowbar Collective should have hired you for Q&A Testing
[4:06:26] <%lotharrio> Noclip to get out of here I think?
[4:06:30] <dukenux> he's loosing it NotLikeThis
[4:06:32] <alrobot2014> its always nice to see someone else get sourced
[4:06:37] <major_gnuisance> Waiting for the out of bounds quicksave
[4:06:42] <%RioGascar> @disposableagent6362 im not gonna bother arguing with a person who wont listen to reason. so here ya go: the half life 2 beta that we had leaked was in 2003 along with the sources...source code. The cremator and other concepts were before the e3 behind doors demo cause valve went through multiple versions of half life 2.
[4:06:42] <%Balkespower> Woolie got Source'd again
[4:06:45] <%derap41> Game is currently on fire
[4:06:48] <Lieutenant_America> "Climb inside and accept your death."
[4:06:49] <jorniev> JANK IS TOTALLY A SKILL
[4:06:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dukenux Speccing your build for +150% Bug Appearance Rate is a risky move.
[4:06:58] <%Javaa01> I mean, everything based on parts of the Quake engine is based on wise uses of jank
[4:07:02] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:07:07] <%BNPhone> EZ
[4:07:09] <%The_Timo> Just load lol
[4:07:10] <+Grayhammatter> we take those
[4:07:10] <%lotharrio> Just luring enemies into meat gags.
[4:07:10] <%Gruhunchously> It's burning, man, it's burning
[4:07:12] <@Solidus_113> WOW
[4:07:12] <gamewarden92> Holy shit
[4:07:13] <%Haarute> YOURE ARE SOURCING THEM

[4:07:15] <+Grayhammatter> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:07:16] <+Deko_> PogChamp
[4:07:19] <%natebud> Black Mesa is the ultimate placebo, this game is all glitches
[4:07:19] <dukenux> you can just go pass it LUL
[4:07:24] <jorniev> WOAAAAAH
[4:07:26] <dukenux> monkaS
[4:07:26] <%ChoculaUltra> it feels oddly on brand for Gordan Freeman to just not go according to plan
[4:07:28] <%purplehermit12> "lets just see where this leads"
[4:07:29] <jorniev> LEEET SKILLS
[4:07:32] <+Deko_> it was a happy accident
[4:07:32] <dukenux> Bold move, Cotton
[4:07:34] <%BNPhone> follow the red lines
[4:07:35] <%Tuna_Can_0> Saved jank FeelsGoodMan
[4:07:37] <major_gnuisance> USE YOUR RUNNER VISION WOOLIE!
[4:07:37] <%Javaa01> Gotta climb the middle
[4:07:44] <+R0bobot> middle
[4:07:49] <%Gruhunchously> I don't think this are was thoroughly playtested either
[4:07:53] <%agumon9000> Woolie is very blind to ramps
[4:07:54] <%RioGascar> Wow that force field is just
[4:08:00] <%Javaa01> Jump over
[4:08:02] <%RioGascar> Lazily applied
[4:08:06] <dukenux> atleast he killed all mobs
[4:08:22] <+aishman> Follow the VEIN
[4:08:33] <%Balkespower> why even force fields here I don't get it
[4:08:34] <%BNPhone> he jsut vibin
[4:08:42] <dukenux> yeah this ending level looks like they were just aching to release it
[4:08:42] <%Tuna_Can_0> :(
[4:08:45] <%Javaa01> Gotta climb to the upper conveyor
[4:08:45] <%lotharrio> But Bees remain your friend.
[4:08:45] <%derap41> These grunts just hanging out
[4:08:47] <+therabbles> just leave these barely functioning enemies to their fate
[4:08:47] <PsychedelicSnake> Did Woolie get a second stand that allows him to break games
[4:08:50] <+AsinPersuasion> who needs gun when crowbar
[4:08:53] <%Gruhunchously> Makes you wonder why the aliens don't just lock all the doors. It seems the most effective strategy
[4:08:54] <pennykettle_> Balkespower because the original had force fields so black mesa needs random ones too
[4:08:55] <%RioGascar> They dont actually make sense why force fields are here
[4:08:57] <major_gnuisance> It's almost as if this was some sort of haul ass segment
[4:09:09] <+VietcongSamurai> tomatoBWL
[4:09:09] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:09:10] <%Gruhunchously> Actually the music continues playing regardless.
[4:09:11] <%RioGascar> like this is a problem with what they doing here
[4:09:13] <%Javaa01> You don't need to go back
[4:09:15] <%Tuna_Can_0> Sourced GabeN
[4:09:16] <%natebud> @major_gnuisance devs should have made it that way then
[4:09:18] <%Balkespower> LMAO
[4:09:19] <%Gruhunchously> Until the track is over
[4:09:26] <HitchhikingThrough> @Lieutenant_America how you doing man?
[4:09:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @psychedelicsnake Bring Me To Life Requiem: You Can (Not) Live
[4:09:31] <%Balkespower> Woolie casually clipping through force fields
[4:09:36] <%RioGascar> they are not considering why these fields exist and WHY THERES LIKE SO MANY OF EM
[4:09:40] <JacexDowozWideo> HypeGriffin2 HypeGriffin3 HypeGriffin4 HypeGriffin5

[4:10:15] <%natebud> Woolie has seen through the veil
[4:10:15] <%Gruhunchously> Woolie learned how to break games back in his QA days
[4:10:18] <%Javaa01> Go into the blue
[4:10:23] <dukenux> Half-Life, full consequences
[4:10:25] <Lieutenant_America> @Youwereeatenbyalid Woolie is an entity of entropy, but I also know I'm the only one here who likes Interloper. And apparently one of the few who like Black Mesa at all.
[4:10:25] <HitchhikingThrough> WEAPONIZED QA
[4:10:31] <%Balkespower> please Save Woolie!
[4:10:33] <+mrcooperblack> Yo woolie was there a sale? I couldn't tell because that looked FREE

[4:10:54] <DisposableAgent6362> @RioGascar I am here mostly to just bitch about the retail game not having diversity of enemies and weapons aka i'm triggered at Valve's choices.
[4:10:56] <%RioGascar> With what
[4:10:56] <%Balkespower> use another gun
[4:10:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> you can't blow it up with the bee

[4:12:22] <AppleBerryKitty> Music DONT STOP
[4:12:29] <%BNPhone> VORTY IS KILL Achievement is KILL
[4:12:34] <%RioGascar> They think cause they give you infinite ammo they can sorta just do whatever they want
[4:12:39] <%natebud> Imagine if you have to shoot grunts in residue processing, that's this level.
[4:12:42] <Drchandragupta> it's been killed for a few hours @xx123manxx
[4:12:57] <Drchandragupta> Woolie "Are you green on the inside too" Madden
[4:13:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> DID HE KILL THE GALUNGAS?
[4:13:03] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Now's probably a bad time to mention I liked Residue Processing
[4:13:09] <+gustavozxd> this is a completely different game like holy shit
[4:13:11] <%Balkespower> I like this song
[4:13:12] <jorniev> FEEL THE STING OF THE VORTESSENCE
[4:13:15] <%Javaa01> @xx123manxx Woolie killed vorts in the very first controller encounter in Interloper, that cheevo was long gone
[4:13:18] <OldOnyx> vort murder spree
[4:13:27] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America I like residue processing too, but imagine standing on conveyor belts and having to shoot back at something
[4:13:28] <Lieutenant_America> But hey, my favorite parts of HL2 are also apparently the parts everyone hates, so at least there's consistency
[4:13:34] <dukenux> bless reggie's eyes
[4:13:40] <dukenux> yep
[4:13:42] <%lotharrio> Oh...
[4:13:44] <%derap41> @OldOnyx Who needs Vort when you have LAZA
[4:13:45] <%Balkespower> I somehow blitzed through this while killing every controller
[4:13:46] <%Haarute> SOLDIER FACTORY

[4:14:19] <@akuda_bar> oooooaaaaaaaa oooooooooaaaaaa
[4:14:23] <dukenux> this song got pretty monotone tho
[4:14:26] <Lieutenant_America> The US Military: "We must not allow an infantry gap!"
[4:14:31] <%Balkespower> WORDS THAT KILL
[4:14:31] <%RioGascar> So this must have changed

[4:14:53] <+gustavozxd> this song is cool for like 1 minute of cool
[4:15:06] <%Gruhunchously> It's one minute of cool on a loop
[4:15:11] <%derap41> Bust these 5heads
[4:15:13] <%Balkespower> I wish this song would change somehow now
[4:15:14] <%BNPhone> The songs in black mesa are good just they have no idea when to start and stop them
[4:15:17] <HitchhikingThrough> yup
[4:15:30] <%RioGascar> this song also breaks half lifes rules
[4:15:35] <+gustavozxd> @xx123manxx that's what I'm feeling from this one lol
[4:15:39] <HitchhikingThrough> current plan: go
[4:15:40] <%BNPhone> Good thing this aint half life
[4:15:43] <@Solidus_113> rail shooter
[4:15:43] <shamuzu> they should have just reused the original OST
[4:15:44] <jorniev> VOOOOOORT
[4:15:46] <%Balkespower> well I did not run into that song problem since I was done with this fast
[4:15:46] <%RioGascar> the music doesnt loop in many many cases
[4:15:48] <%natebud> This song is really magical for a place that is fucking awful
[4:15:48] <dukenux> yeah, just move and fuck shit up on the go

[4:15:49] <+gustavozxd> LUL

[4:16:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> UNLIMITED POWER!
[4:16:18] <%Gruhunchously> @RioGascar Yeah, songs in Half Life usually just run their course and then stop, they rarely loop.
[4:16:19] <%derap41> @RioGascar I guess they finally learned that its better to have a looping track
[4:16:20] <+Grayhammatter> oh jesuse
[4:16:23] <+gustavozxd> scuffed on rail shooter

[4:18:18] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[4:18:24] <%Gruhunchously> @Youwereeatenbyalid You could argue that most of Xen, both her and the original game, wasn't Half Life.

[4:19:37] <%RioGascar> I like how so far
[4:19:38] <Drchandragupta> Should we really be surprised woolie's fucking over the slaves
[4:19:43] <Drchandragupta> he hasn't even gotten any jetpacks
[4:19:47] <%Gruhunchously> @pshuuu Bah, Omikron is just Unreal with two good set pieces and five hideously boring ones.
[4:19:49] <HitchhikingThrough> Woolie will kill the aliens to secure the only supply of jetpacks
[4:19:50] <%Balkespower> last part of Interloper
[4:19:52] <Mrthefro> Is this the 2nd or 3rd Xen stream?

[4:22:11] <%agumon9000> We can use those to connect power.
[4:22:11] <HitchhikingThrough> right at the very end
[4:22:14] <@akuda_bar> Look Gordon! Ropes! We can use these to traverse pits!
[4:22:18] <HitchhikingThrough> right before the final boss
[4:22:22] <Lieutenant_America> Barnacles were invented to FORCE players to look up.
[4:22:31] <dukenux> Gordon is getting panic attack from hanging wires
[4:22:32] <cero_5> it gets to the point where any vertical line makes you nervous
[4:22:44] <%natebud> Time to use those satchels I guess.
[4:22:45] <JacexDowozWideo> the last boss is a barnacle, but this time, it's sideways
[4:22:45] <%Balkespower> Hello Gordon!
[4:22:51] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @jorniev
[4:22:59] <+gustavozxd> so woolie's playing ff7 on his own?
[4:23:04] <HitchhikingThrough> I like to imagine that ambushes from above don't work in the half life universe due to everyone constantly checking for the little fuckers
[4:23:05] <%RioGascar> So did the black mesa stafff just
[4:23:06] <%RioGascar> Idk
[4:23:10] <%Gruhunchously> Barnacle's were created specifically because Valve realized that their playtesters were never looking up.
[4:23:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:23:11] <%derap41> He's doing his best ok
[4:23:13] <jorniev> is it time to fight jeff bezos yet?
[4:23:13] <%Balkespower> oh yeah
[4:23:14] <%RioGascar> Give up on sending gordon ammo
[4:23:17] <%RioGascar> take a break
[4:23:23] <%RioGascar> had a smoke?
[4:23:27] <%Balkespower> you find Controllers annoying?
[4:23:32] <%natebud> They're being killed by race x right now @RioGascar
[4:23:35] <HitchhikingThrough> Is this actually RE5?
[4:23:38] <alrobot2014> bets on it saving
[4:23:38] <HitchhikingThrough> SAVE
[4:23:43] <alrobot2014> SAVE
[4:23:54] <%Balkespower> How about controllers with shields, where you need to run away like a bitch and find the shield source?
[4:23:55] <JacexDowozWideo> footsied
[4:23:56] <akman14> He vibing
[4:24:00] <%Balkespower> now that's "fun"
[4:24:03] <%Gruhunchously> Dance away
[4:24:09] <%natebud> @RioGascar or wait no, that's after the final boss, I don't know what they're up to. I guess they didn't think Gordon would take this long
[4:24:10] <DisposableAgent6362> @RioGascar As he said, getting pummeled by Race X just to be nuked later.
[4:24:19] <%Gruhunchously> It's cover shooting before cover shooting
[4:24:20] <JacexDowozWideo> fucking MEATBALL?
[4:24:31] <%Balkespower> also the physics throw does WAY TOO MUCH DAMAGE
[4:24:31] <%natebud> @DisposableAgent6362 Nah, I'm wrong race x shows up after Half Life ends
[4:24:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gordon's bones are currently 90% morphine
[4:24:43] <%Balkespower> it is almost instant death
[4:24:47] <%Gruhunchously> Oh, this kind of enemy was real fun in Mass Effect: Andromeda /s
[4:24:56] <JacexDowozWideo> race x all about that free real estate
[4:25:03] <%Balkespower> doesn't matter if you have 100H 100A
[4:25:09] <HitchhikingThrough> Speaking of shields and on an unrelated note
[4:25:13] <HitchhikingThrough> FUCK THE ARCHVILE
[4:25:15] <%RioGascar> Race x is opposing force
[4:25:30] <HitchhikingThrough> that is all
[4:25:32] <%Balkespower> one throw from that Rock will put you into critical health immediately
[4:25:40] <%RyuuAoi> Is Woolie playing wih arcade stick?
[4:25:40] <jorniev> HL2 still has the best victory run sequence
[4:25:41] <%Balkespower> if not killing you outright
[4:25:47] <%derap41> Getting real sick that web texture
[4:25:48] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud Gordon gets into the portal and some time later in the next locations we see them appear, no? Ik, they have not been confirmed as canon but still
[4:25:48] <%Javaa01> Nope, those are just equipment
[4:25:52] <%RioGascar> Dont worry woolie, you’ll see non human things...next game
[4:25:55] <cero_5> I love how they're just Galungas now lmao
[4:25:58] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud as Adrian I mean
[4:26:00] <%nothuzad> man constantly disrespecting vortigaunts :(
[4:26:03] <cero_5> fuck their actual name
[4:26:07] <%purplehermit12> literally just called galungas to him now
[4:26:10] <%Gruhunchously> @Balkespower They figured out that they live in the Source engine and the subsequent power of physics objects.

[4:26:45] <+gustavozxd> in 2 yes

[4:26:50] <dukenux> ohh, meta
[4:26:51] <Lieutenant_America> @dukenux I think they weren't even called Vorts until HL2
[4:26:52] <%nothuzad> dukenux subtitles in this - in other games tehy are named
[4:26:57] <+Pyroclase> inteloper
[4:26:57] <@Solidus_113> you've got maybe an hour left

[4:28:06] <%Gruhunchously> @derap41 Aperture Science with access to Xen. Now that's scary.
[4:28:06] <%natebud> @DisposableAgent6362 Now that I think about it, the first race x enemy shows up before you see gordon leave, but you don't get to fight them until much later.
[4:28:07] <+gustavozxd> @derap41 find out in half life 3 atpRtsd4
[4:28:09] <%Balkespower> depending on how fast Woolie can clear this section
[4:28:09] <%BNPhone> wait maybe i aam rart
[4:28:14] <+Goobbue> Actually I'm pretty sure the name Vortigaunt was used before HL2 came out, it was mentioned in some stuff like the manuals for the expansions. They just didn't have the name at the launch of HL1
[4:28:31] <pennykettle_> LOL
[4:28:31] <%RioGascar> I remember ross scott talking about freemans mind for black mesa prior to finishing half life 1. he said he actually didnt thjnk the direction they went make sense for the gordon hes made. plus at the time xen was still not finished
[4:28:35] <major_gnuisance> @WoolieVersus Is there a power source to the shield?
[4:28:35] <%Javaa01> Look up at the wall
[4:28:38] <+Grayhammatter> look up
[4:28:42] <pennykettle_> that wasnt a ledge that was the rail 1 inch from your face
[4:28:44] <AppleBerryKitty> what are we not seeing..
[4:28:47] <%Javaa01> Blind as FUCK
[4:28:48] <%derap41> he did it
[4:28:48] <AppleBerryKitty> ah
[4:28:52] <%Balkespower> ncie find
[4:28:52] <gunsrlove> SAVE
[4:28:59] <EDFscout> shifting into dog mode
[4:29:03] <+deanbees> Does Woolie have any plansof going to HL2 after this???
[4:29:11] <Saffry_Ruzin> Yes
[4:29:12] <Lieutenant_America> @RioGascar Freeman's Mind is basically built around Gordon griping about Cinema Sins
[4:29:12] <%Balkespower> THIS FUCKING SECTION
[4:29:12] <+gustavozxd> hopefully
[4:29:16] <dukenux> probably later
[4:29:26] <%derap41> @deanbees Think he's taking a break from half life first
[4:29:30] <Lieutenant_America> @RioGascar So a more grounded world would act against that
[4:29:31] <%Balkespower> This section has no purpose other than stretching the game
[4:29:34] <%Gruhunchously> So I guess Crowbar Collective were like, 'YOu know those levels that nobody likes? Let's make them even longer!"
[4:29:42] <Lieutenant_America> It's part of why I don't think HL2 is a good fit for Freeman's Mind
[4:29:48] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud I count events of OF as canon, cause it expands on the universe which is always a plus (as you you already noticed my negativity towards the lack of content in second game). Which makes you wonder just what kind of massacre is going on in the lambda parts of the facility.
[4:29:49] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus which is stronger: Achoota or Galunga?
[4:29:49] <%generalve> this is why people hate Xen
[4:30:01] <@Solidus_113> run and tell THAT
[4:30:01] <%RioGascar> Ross will have to change freeman
[4:30:03] <DisposableAgent6362> @Gruhunchously The same people who apparently shortened the "On A Rail" chapter lol

[4:30:47] <%lotharrio> I think it's time for Snarks.
[4:30:51] <Lieutenant_America> @RioGascar I'm beginning to doubt he will. Freeman is literally in the position of worship he always asked for and it's taking a breathtaking level of density for him to not notice it.
[4:30:55] <%Balkespower> oh we are not there yet
[4:31:02] <%Balkespower> ok I raged a bit too early LUL
[4:31:04] <%natebud> Snarks actually attack grunts now, so why now?
[4:31:07] <%derap41> Like these hyper advance brain aliens chuck rocks
[4:31:12] <@Solidus_113> this is the first of like 4 of these rooms
[4:31:18] <%purplehermit12> woolie is clearly bigger than reggie and minh
[4:31:22] <JacexDowozWideo> @natebud snark rebellion
[4:31:22] <%RioGascar> Theres more rooms
[4:31:23] <%purplehermit12> why doesnt he simply eat the other 2

[4:32:14] <%Gruhunchously> What if the vocals just randomly kick in again?
[4:32:18] <pennykettle_> is that a vortigaunt fused into a boulder?
[4:32:19] <HitchhikingThrough> that source boulder is the goofiest shit
[4:32:19] <+gustavozxd> dudes respawning on top of dead bodies
[4:32:19] <%Balkespower> Ga Galinga chA
[4:32:20] <%RioGascar> I really wanna know why the lambda team decided to stop sending freeman guns and ammo

[4:32:33] <Saffry_Ruzin> The Galunga War Starts Now

[4:32:35] <Pistachius> i remember those aliens would heal me in the original or am i remembering wrong?
[4:32:39] <gamewarden92> Maybe they ran out.
[4:32:42] <pennykettle_> in hl2 Pistachius
[4:32:42] <%Gruhunchously> @RioGascar Maybe they ran out of ammo
[4:32:42] <+YungSkywacka> Controller and mouse? DansGame
[4:32:46] <%RioGascar> I get it video game thing of we now have infinite ammo
[4:32:49] <+deanbees> @Javaa01 I both love and am disgusted by that description.
[4:32:53] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe they lost track of Gordon
[4:32:55] <Pistachius> @pennykettle_ aaaaah. ok ok
[4:32:55] <major_gnuisance> @WoolieVersus The shield is higher this time. WHY WOULD THAT BE?
[4:33:02] <%RioGascar> but this makes no sense in universe
[4:33:02] <%Javaa01> @Pistachius They give you armor zaps in HL2
[4:33:03] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud Probably, but closer to the nuke going off it must have been pretty quiet inside the facility and hell outside.
[4:33:24] <%chiluzza> jump over it using the pad
[4:33:35] <%derap41> pipe
[4:33:37] <%BNPhone> pipe
[4:33:38] <%Balkespower> use that pipe!
[4:33:39] <@Solidus_113> lights
[4:33:40] <%Javaa01> Use tube for good viewpoint
[4:33:41] <EDFscout> under!
[4:33:41] <gunsrlove> pipe
[4:33:43] <+Grayhammatter> walk on that pipe?
[4:33:50] <oceanmatt> pipe
[4:33:51] <+HaunchPaunch> Follow the pipe down and around
[4:33:51] <%Balkespower> walk on that pipe
[4:33:52] <%derap41> That works too I guess
[4:33:57] <Pistachius> i need to replay the whole series. hl1/2 blue shift , opposing force, had some good times
[4:34:14] <%natebud> @DisposableAgent6362 I just played OpFor and I'm trying to put together the timelines. I think the first race x alien appears right after forget about freeman
[4:34:19] <DisposableAgent6362> @RioGascar After we teleported to Xen the aliens started swarming in and most likely overwhelmed them. I cant think of any other reason they went silent.
[4:34:23] <+gustavozxd> yeah bonk his head with the grenade LUL
[4:34:30] <%steelmorrigan> PIPE
[4:34:30] <%Balkespower> Walk on the pipe, Woolie.
[4:34:33] <+some_brave_apollo> the pipe is a ramp
[4:34:36] <@Solidus_113> woolie the lights
[4:34:41] <pennykettle_> doesnt he have a mid air omidrectional dash
[4:34:42] <Saffry_Ruzin> pipe
[4:34:56] <%Balkespower> Source platforming
[4:35:01] <%natebud> yeah, but it's way too powerful for precision jumping
[4:35:03] <crossing_mao> Woolie needs some pipe Kreygasm
[4:35:03] <+PunJ0hn> galunga
[4:35:04] <%GraceTBM> it's a momentum based dash not like eternal

[4:35:51] <major_gnuisance> @GeneralSCPatton this
[4:35:52] <dukenux> Chaaa la, Ga Lunga
[4:35:54] <%Gruhunchously> GUNG
[4:35:57] <%BNPhone> there is more juice ahead
[4:35:59] <EDFscout> GUNG
[4:35:59] <VJdarkworld> galunga
[4:36:06] <EASrake> Galunga gang
[4:36:12] <%Balkespower> Galunga?!
[4:36:22] <%BNPhone> where my galugers at
[4:36:27] <EDFscout> Galunga style
[4:36:33] <dukenux> It gets more play than in HL atleast
[4:36:40] <%purplehermit12> @xx123manxx watch it with the hard R my man
[4:36:41] <EDFscout> he just noticed they use the same ammo?
[4:36:44] <%Balkespower> because that weapon is the RADDEST!
[4:36:46] <+gustavozxd> was this gun in the first game?
[4:36:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Quantum Firehose is BAE
[4:36:49] <%BNPhone> yes
[4:36:51] <dukenux> yes
[4:36:53] <%Balkespower> love the vacuum cleaner
[4:36:54] <%derap41> This freaking net texture is getting on my nerves
[4:36:57] <dukenux> all the guns were in the first one
[4:36:58] <%Gruhunchously> @gustavozxd Or to be more specific, it looks like the awful, low lighting, texture soup that makes up like 80% of Omikron.
[4:37:02] <zocano> It was but you had way less ammo for it
[4:37:06] <dukenux> LUL
[4:37:07] <%agumon9000> GAH!
[4:37:08] <%agumon9000> NO!
[4:37:11] <%agumon9000> Staph!
[4:37:13] <%RioGascar> It gets more use in this probably because it comes in so late and gets so little full use
[4:37:14] <+Nanani1990> alien nerds > human nerds
[4:37:15] <pennykettle_> Galungabus
[4:37:19] <@akuda_bar> Hello Gordon!
[4:37:19] <+gustavozxd> weird cause I don't remember this gun at all, and i played it back in january
[4:37:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:37:23] <alrobot2014> they sent you potato chips
[4:37:25] <%Balkespower> jump there
[4:37:27] <%nothuzad> scientist have sent you bazooka ammo etc. multiple times
[4:37:27] <%derap41> Nerds they can fuck off teachers can suck my cock cause this is getting learnt with Woolie
[4:37:37] <jorniev> ONLY TRUST CLEINER AND ELI
[4:37:42] <alrobot2014> which is arguably worse because you know those bags were half full
[4:37:48] <%The_Timo> Gordon has been in here for a long fucking time, probably starving lol
[4:37:51] <OldOnyx> the galungas are not only nerds but hippy nerds
[4:37:52] <EASrake> Galunga is a slur
[4:37:52] <%GraceTBM> pretty sure you can miss both the tau and gluon
[4:37:56] <+gustavozxd> @Gruhunchously we need the training room music right now
[4:38:02] <major_gnuisance> @WoolieVersus Funfact: the Gluon Gun's name in the code is weapon_egon, as in Egon from Ghostbusters.
[4:38:06] <+some_brave_apollo> i'm amazed that this level is still going
[4:38:10] <+gustavozxd> half life infinite
[4:38:12] <%lotharrio> Sort of how like R2 and Chewbacca come across as really capable, despite not knowing what they say.
[4:38:18] <EDFscout> yeyeye getting there woolieGASM
[4:38:19] <%Balkespower> GALUNGA GANG RISE UP!
[4:38:22] <%Gruhunchously> WHERE MY GALUNGAS AT?
[4:38:23] <unit24> the presence of a glare on woolie's TV is probably the cause for a lot of his blindness
[4:38:23] <%ChoculaUltra> @major_gnuisance oooo thats neat
[4:38:26] <+Testfall_V> All this time, we thought Woolie is blind - turns out his TV is basically 75% mirror
[4:38:32] <%natebud> They originally wanted to call it the Harold Ramis gun
[4:38:32] <%purplehermit12> galungas in paradise
[4:38:34] <%derap41> @EASrake not for Galunga's
[4:38:35] <VJdarkworld> galungas in nevada
[4:38:41] <gamewarden92> Are we at Alien Candyland yet?
[4:38:57] <DisposableAgent6362> @natebud They timed their appearances to be specifically after Gordon and Barney were out of "hot zone". They were probably teleporting around the time Freeman was finally making his way into the Lambda Complex, but on smaller scale. It increased as time went on, but Freeman was already flexing deep in Xen.
[4:39:37] <alrobot2014> i wonder what that fluid was
[4:39:40] <%Balkespower> Galunga in Germany
[4:39:44] <%BNPhone> is blud
[4:39:48] <JacexDowozWideo> alien meat gag
[4:39:51] <%RioGascar> Blood
[4:39:53] <%Balkespower> Piercing the heavens
[4:39:56] <%Balkespower> THIS PART!
[4:39:58] <%Gruhunchously> So this is literally a proton pack then?
[4:40:00] <major_gnuisance> liquified fart gas
[4:40:02] <%Balkespower> THIS FUCKING PART!
[4:40:14] <%Gruhunchously> Something FAT
[4:40:19] <%BNPhone> dont think just shoot 4Head
[4:40:21] <VJdarkworld> multi-path :O
[4:40:21] <%natebud> "That was cool right? Now do it again"
[4:40:23] <Lieutenant_America> They're waiting for you Gordon
[4:40:23] <%Balkespower> this part servers no purpose except stretching the game
[4:40:28] <%Javaa01> Nah, just trap you
[4:40:41] <%Gruhunchously> Do it again, stupid
[4:40:41] <%derap41> @Balkespower Yeah this does drag a bit
[4:40:51] <%RioGascar> oh boy woolie i hope you love rule of 3’s
[4:40:55] <%Balkespower> This part where you need to disable 3 shields to move on
[4:41:03] <%Balkespower> this part should have been deleted
[4:41:10] <+Grayhammatter> galunga gang NO!
[4:41:19] <%natebud> good thing vorts are chumps that can be completely ignored.
[4:41:22] <%BNPhone> GalunGang
[4:41:24] <Lieutenant_America> @Balkespower Yeah that was real hard just now
[4:41:27] <%Gruhunchously> That's the problem with fan projects, they just don't know when to stop.
[4:41:30] <+shry7> !uptime
[4:41:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 56 minutes
[4:41:31] <VJdarkworld> this part is when galunga gung galung
[4:41:32] <%RioGascar> Disable 3 shields, disable 3 shields for controller fuckers, kill 3 controllers
[4:41:34] <%derap41> They pretty used to not being free
[4:41:35] <gamewarden92> They aren't really free yet.
[4:41:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not free yet.
[4:41:36] <dukenux> zug zug
[4:41:37] <%lotharrio> Well they're still stuck here.
[4:41:42] <EASrake> They're just gonna get in trouble
[4:41:51] <%natebud> now the laser puzzles begin
[4:41:57] <%derap41> Pretty sure they're kinda Breed to not think freely
[4:42:05] <%Gruhunchously> Well, the slave mindset isn't something you can just unlearn in an hour.
[4:42:07] <%Balkespower> and the worst part is: all 3 are more or less the same
[4:42:12] <%Balkespower> just slighty different
[4:42:18] <%Javaa01> Shoot the red above it
[4:42:18] <+theKingRamses> above
[4:42:19] <+Testfall_V> b-l-in-d
[4:42:19] <%Haarute> UP
[4:42:20] <alrobot2014> one on otop
[4:42:21] <dukenux> above
[4:42:23] <%Balkespower> it is almost like the devs ran out of ideas
[4:42:23] <JacexDowozWideo> woolz
[4:42:24] <+deanbees> Actually blind
[4:42:24] <+Grayhammatter> guys....
[4:42:25] <%Irridium> look at that red thing to the top left
[4:42:26] <resloxxx> LUL
[4:42:26] <+gustavozxd> did he not see it?
[4:42:27] <+Reverend_Roscoe> DIG UP STUPID
[4:42:27] <+sir_louis> dig up
[4:42:27] <%chiluzza> ABOVE
[4:42:27] <skattikus> literally blind
[4:42:28] <dukenux> there's a 2nd one
[4:42:30] <Owlboy7> blind af LUL}
[4:42:30] <asurite_warrior> blind
[4:42:30] <+gustavozxd> there's no way
[4:42:31] <+Grayhammatter> are you serious?
[4:42:31] <major_gnuisance> wow
[4:42:31] <pennykettle_> LUL
[4:42:32] <%chiluzza> DIG UP STUPID
[4:42:32] <%Javaa01> The blindest he's ever been
[4:42:32] <EDFscout> dig up
[4:42:34] <%The_Timo> Just the most blind people lol
[4:42:36] <2deep5u> ayy lmao
[4:42:38] <%BNPhone> bawkKek
[4:42:39] <pennykettle_> to their credit this makes no sense
[4:42:41] <%steelmorrigan> >.<
[4:42:43] <%natebud> The devs had ideas, they just wanted you to appreciate their ideas at least 3 times
[4:42:50] <VJdarkworld> mangoReally
[4:42:56] <%Gruhunchously> Death Lasers
[4:43:05] <%chiluzza> galunga
[4:43:16] <+gustavozxd> @natebud only 3?
[4:43:17] <Drchandragupta> Yeah this level really feels padded
[4:43:18] <@Solidus_113> follow it
[4:43:19] <%Javaa01> Follow the red vein
[4:43:21] <%derap41> @natebud Rule of 3
[4:43:28] <VJdarkworld> follow, freeman
[4:43:28] <%Balkespower> stretch it like it's DMC4
[4:43:29] <Drchandragupta> which is lame because it's already a bit too long
[4:43:30] <JacexDowozWideo> guys, hear me out. galunga.
[4:43:31] <%RioGascar> Hope you love that rule of 3
[4:43:33] <%Gruhunchously> Is that a chess board on the wall there?
[4:43:33] <dukenux> I kinda hope for "Director's Cut" of this, where they trim the fat off
[4:43:34] <+PunJ0hn> JALA GALUNG GUNGA
[4:43:34] <+gustavozxd> the third strike is what counts
[4:43:41] <%Vorga1339> this playthrough has been a hard confirm for all of the reasons that modern shooters have been streamlined
[4:43:46] <Lieutenant_America> Reggie is trying
[4:43:47] <zamzoph> KILL
[4:43:47] <%Javaa01> Okay now BOTH of you are overthinking this
[4:43:54] <%derap41> Chaa Galunga
[4:43:59] <%Balkespower> I swear from this point on I wanted to end this game
[4:43:59] <AppleBerryKitty> translate chat!
[4:44:00] <%BNPhone> look with ur special eyes
[4:44:04] <%natebud> lettuce leaf
[4:44:09] <@Solidus_113> the floor
[4:44:16] <%Balkespower> into the shaft
[4:44:16] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:44:18] <Drchandragupta> @nawji you sure it's not a symptom of the streamlining?
[4:44:21] <dukenux> Vent fren :)
[4:44:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[4:44:26] <@Solidus_113> the big obvious smoke effect
[4:44:30] <+gustavozxd> @Drchandragupta maybe a bit of both
[4:44:36] <+deanbees> Finally, Galunga.
[4:44:37] <%Balkespower> Now do it 2 more times
[4:44:40] <dukenux> so you've climbin up for last hour
[4:44:40] <%Balkespower> because reasons
[4:44:41] <alrobot2014> save?
[4:44:42] <%Vorga1339> @Drchandragupta you could work the argument either way
[4:44:44] <%Gruhunchously> @nawji It's kind of a paradox, because it's a fan remake of an older game that post-dates most modern shooters. It's almost like it itself is a reaction against streamlined modern shooters.
[4:44:45] <EDFscout> naive.
[4:44:45] <Drchandragupta> I can work with that @gustavozxd
[4:44:46] <dukenux> but now you're down again
[4:44:47] <%Balkespower> SAVE
[4:44:47] <%natebud> The last time woolie saw magnum ammo, he was still in the sewers
[4:44:54] <%derap41> This place is so uniformly textured that I can't keep track of locations
[4:44:56] <resloxxx> man those landing jets are reliable, how many G's does that thing generate
[4:44:57] <VJdarkworld> this part is important to teach woolie fps game sense. woolie gonna be fps master by end of game
[4:45:00] <%BNPhone> SIKE
[4:45:01] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL
[4:45:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:45:05] <@Solidus_113> Much like dogs, Woolie can't look up
[4:45:08] <+CaptainJax> It never happened
[4:45:09] <%Vorga1339> @Drchandragupta if they weren't streamlined in the first place a lot less people would bother with playing them, so they streamlined them to get more people to play them
[4:45:14] <%Javaa01> Please say sike
[4:45:14] <EDFscout> shift into dog mode
[4:45:16] <Lieutenant_America> The Vorts start laughing and pointing
[4:45:17] <+gustavozxd> the fact that half life 1 felt like i was sequence breaking most of the time says a lot about what i'm used to in FPS games
[4:45:24] <%steelmorrigan> many doors
[4:45:29] <+theKingRamses> the pillar that's on fire is done
[4:45:32] <%natebud> go solve two more laser puzzles
[4:45:33] <+theKingRamses> i think
[4:45:41] <%Javaa01> Follow the veins
[4:45:42] <%lotharrio> There were three glowing doors.
[4:45:43] <%steelmorrigan> still that one
[4:45:47] <%BNPhone> still that one
[4:45:48] <EDFscout> walk again
[4:45:48] <%Balkespower> walk up there again
[4:45:51] <+Grayhammatter> you still have 2 more paths in that place
[4:45:52] <%Irridium> @Solidus_113 all I can think of seeing woolie not looking up is the dev commentary in Half Life 2 where they kept going on about how hard it was to get people to look up LUL
[4:45:55] <shamuzu> NotLikeThis
[4:46:01] <%RioGascar> Oh boy padding
[4:46:06] <Drchandragupta> @nawji fair, but also the streamlining means people are less acquanted to older gamelogic and aren't equipped to do some of the things the game would want
[4:46:13] <%Balkespower> I hate this part so much
[4:46:16] <%BNPhone> Interl ResidentSleeper per
[4:46:18] <Drchandragupta> Disclaimer I think this level suuuucks I just don't think that's why it sucks
[4:46:20] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:46:24] <dukenux> LUL
[4:46:24] <%Gruhunchously> @Irridium That's the reason barnacles exist, to condition players to look up more.
[4:46:25] <%derap41> LUL

[4:46:53] <Rain_Mage> "How dare you take our property"
[4:46:56] <unit24> did woolie just say g*lunger
[4:46:56] <%natebud> Brain pride march

[4:47:12] <%The_Timo> a WHITE MAN
[4:47:15] <%lotharrio> Woolie the thief, stealing Gallungas from the brains.
[4:47:15] <%Gruhunchously> HUMAN SAVIORISM

[4:47:20] <Calaminty> THE FREEMAN!
[4:47:21] <%Irridium> a white human
[4:47:27] <%Gruhunchously> THE FREEMAN
[4:47:29] <Lewisisphat> all of a sudden we a kojima game
[4:47:29] <%derap41> a FREEMAN
[4:47:29] <%Balkespower> THE ONE FREEMAN!
[4:47:31] <Drchandragupta> You see, the Vortigaunts have certain dimples in the back of their skulls that indicate a subservient attitutde
[4:47:32] <+pedrothecruel> GULANGA UNCHAINED
[4:47:33] <%RioGascar> i mean they are mind controlled
[4:47:43] <asurite_warrior> ok but would you stop horrible horrible slavery if you saw it

[4:47:57] <pennykettle_> When you really think about it, enslaving the Gulungas helped them out a lot. Their homeworld sucked, the slavers gave the galungas culture

[4:57:38] <%derap41> That is Galunga food
[4:57:40] <%Javaa01> Gotta break the grate
[4:57:40] <+Testfall_V> that's the framerate, right in that pile
[4:57:42] <%Gruhunchously> Seems like a waste, really
[4:57:47] <%GraceTBM> shoot vent
[4:57:48] <pennykettle_> shoot it
[4:57:54] <EDFscout> Schut
[4:57:57] <major_gnuisance> ALT-fire the alien grate
[4:57:59] <%The_Timo> That could actually make a cool game concept, where you get the power to control the framerate of reality and need to use it to solve puzzles and what not lol
[4:58:04] <Drchandragupta> Those don't look like Alien Grunt bodies t o me
[4:58:04] <%Haarute> alt fire bee
[4:58:05] <%natebud> And what happens if they find the body?
[4:58:08] <%Javaa01> Just jump and crowbar the vent
[4:58:10] <%GraceTBM> shoot VENT with alt fire
[4:58:11] <%BNPhone> body? what body
[4:58:16] <EDFscout> huheueh
[4:58:17] <Lieutenant_America> @deanbees One thing I find interesting about this entire version of Interloper is that it's about the size of the Citadel, which would make you wonder why Nihilanth ran from the Combine... then you realize the Citadel is nothing but a meager outpost to the Combine, but this tower is the Nihilanth's stronghold.
[4:58:19] <Drchandragupta> Is that not a pile of bodies?
[4:58:22] <Lieutenant_America> The power difference is that big
[4:58:29] <pennykettle_> oh god
[4:58:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:58:30] <%natebud> Shoot the vent that you usually arent able to break
[4:58:31] <%derap41> @Drchandragupta Its a pile of food
[4:58:33] <%RioGascar> Ya know this room would be a perfect room for black mesa stadf to teleport ammo in endlessly
[4:58:33] <%Gruhunchously> @natebud Body? What body?
[4:58:38] <%RioGascar> something valve does
[4:58:39] <+bear_breaker20> 1st try
[4:58:42] <jackelzxaa> gettin there

[4:58:50] <dukenux> that looks like the elevator in HL2
[4:58:53] <%GraceTBM> jump in use lasers
[4:58:53] <%Balkespower> this part is mostly hype
[4:58:56] <Drchandragupta> Ahhh when I played it I mistook them for bodies @derap41

[5:01:41] <%RioGascar> And heres the fuck
[5:01:42] <@Solidus_113> elevator fight
[5:01:43] <%natebud> Now do it two more times!
[5:01:49] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud What were you putting together otherwise?
[5:01:58] <%Balkespower> @xx123manxx it is cool up until the part where you need to run away from 3 shielded controllers like a bitch and destroy the cores
[5:01:58] <%RioGascar> Here’s everything the game can possibly throw at you
[5:02:18] <Lieutenant_America> Keep your back to the wall so you can see the attacks coming
[5:02:18] <EDFscout> plates just protect shield crystals
[5:02:21] <+RueOrin> The plates are cover lol
[5:02:23] <2deep5u> this is route D all over again
[5:02:24] <%Balkespower> because running away like that is "fun"
[5:02:27] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America Comparison video
[5:02:31] <%BNPhone> yep at least the music is cool there @Balkespower
[5:02:31] <@Solidus_113> those are your space invaders shields
[5:02:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> !uptime
[5:02:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 17 minutes
[5:02:43] <EDFscout> who needs safe spaces
[5:02:44] <+deanbees> I'm actually mildly surprised we never got an encounter of stranded marines helplessly dying to the brainlets
[5:02:45] <major_gnuisance> Those perfectly aimed streaming bullets that he keeps failing to dodge... I'm getting flashbacks to Nier: Automata
[5:02:47] <VJdarkworld> yall gonna make gun gan gulung galunga gan
[5:02:49] <alrobot2014> save?
[5:02:54] <@Solidus_113> SourPls

[5:03:01] <resloxxx> SourPls
[5:03:01] <%Balkespower> this music is so GOOOOD THOUGH
[5:03:03] <%purplehermit12> SourPls
[5:03:08] <%BNPhone> SourPls
[5:03:15] <+bear_breaker20> we still save scumming?
[5:03:17] <%derap41> Boss Arena
[5:03:21] <pennykettle_> SourPls
[5:03:21] <%Balkespower> RIP AND TEAR GORDON!
[5:03:23] <%RioGascar> This part is really good but man it throws EVERYTHING at you
[5:03:27] <+theKingRamses> turn up bfg division
[5:03:27] <%Gruhunchously> RIP AND TEAR
[5:03:29] <Lieutenant_America> @natebud Hell, do both. I disagree with you about the overall quality of the game, but there's always room for improvement (and I want those goddamned Bullsquids fixed).
[5:03:32] <%Balkespower> UNTIL IT IS DONE
[5:03:33] <dukenux> UNTIL ITS DONE
[5:03:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[5:03:40] <jackelzxaa> i really like that they did this for black mesa actually
[5:03:44] <Saffry_Ruzin> Kar En Tuk
[5:03:45] <jackelzxaa> this super powerful end sequence
[5:03:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> [Djent noises]
[5:04:01] <+deanbees> It's the gravity gun/gauntlets super charged, but for HL1.
[5:04:02] <%natebud> @Lieutenant_America Don't get me wrong, overall quality is great, but the gameplay suffers in a lot of ways.
[5:04:03] <+deanbees> I dig it
[5:04:09] <%Balkespower> health is on the other side
[5:04:09] <%RioGascar> Shhh
[5:04:10] <%BNPhone> sit in the pool
[5:04:13] <jackelzxaa> i cant wait to hear woolie's take on comparing the games when he eventually gets to 2 and alyx
[5:04:16] <Lieutenant_America> A big reason I like Interloper is because the setpieces make it feel like a proper climax
[5:04:17] <dukenux> no the end sequence looks good so fat, but the introductuction to it is a slooooog
[5:04:17] <RunningNGunning> No
[5:04:18] <+Buzzkill983> Music is hype
[5:04:19] <dukenux> nope
[5:04:19] <%Javaa01> This is entirely new
[5:04:20] <+Slimshazbot> Not rtemotely
[5:04:20] <zocano> this is completely new
[5:04:20] <EDFscout> NAH
[5:04:20] <aeonicvector> Nope
[5:04:20] <%BNPhone> no
[5:04:20] <+gustavozxd> not even a little
[5:04:21] <+theKingRamses> not at all
[5:04:21] <pennykettle_> NOOOOOOO
[5:04:21] <dukenux> not at all
[5:04:22] <%derap41> This is new
[5:04:22] <%natebud> nope
[5:04:22] <TigerClaws12> NOPE
[5:04:22] <%Irridium> fuck no
[5:04:24] <VJdarkworld> completely brand new
[5:04:24] <unit24> COMPLETELY new
[5:04:25] <+RueOrin> This elevator existed, but was VERY different
[5:04:26] <Visorak6> This is 100% fanservice
[5:04:27] <major_gnuisance> Completely different
[5:04:29] <%Gruhunchously> This all new
[5:04:30] <Lieutenant_America> OG Interloper feels like fucking around with no direction
[5:04:30] <+PunJ0hn> this is really fucking awesome
[5:04:33] <SixthSun2> Elevator seems new
[5:04:34] <%RioGascar> Hell no
[5:04:35] <+bear_breaker20> is the final boss completely new too?
[5:04:36] <%Haarute> TINY bit. you went upwards but it was nothing like this.
[5:04:41] <jackelzxaa> old xen was like 5 shitty islands, a cave, and a nutsack on legs
[5:04:44] <%Irridium> just gotta work on their auto-saves a bit
[5:04:45] <+gustavozxd> alright this is cool
[5:04:46] <+deanbees> @bear_breaker20 Yep!
[5:04:49] <Zeemod155> Definitely feels like they're trying to be all HL2 right now Kappa
[5:04:52] <%Gruhunchously> You guys are fickle
[5:04:59] <%Balkespower> what I liked about this part is the controllers will relentlessy attack you
[5:04:59] <2deep5u> the framerate is in the toilet right now
[5:04:59] <dukenux> when it's nat padded the fuck out
[5:05:00] <VJdarkworld> FICKLE
[5:05:01] <+theKingRamses> same can be said about vanilla hl1/hl2
[5:05:07] <jackelzxaa> the final boss is the same guy but done much differently
[5:05:12] <+bear_breaker20> @deanbees they did a really good job then (seen it already)
[5:05:15] <%Balkespower> and increase in intensity in this section
[5:05:16] <+Grayhammatter> here we go PogChamp
[5:05:17] <%natebud> Woolie isn't actually killing anything. He's just shooting panels. The ultimate placebo LUL
[5:05:19] <%purplehermit12> SourPls
[5:05:23] <%derap41> Rule of 3 again
[5:05:24] <%Gruhunchously> This is some heavy metal album cover shit
[5:05:28] <%BNPhone> I'm very much in the camp that Black Mesa is not at all a replacement for HL1 and is instead a nice desert
[5:05:30] <%Balkespower> this arena however
[5:05:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:05:31] <arran_throttle> this music giving me Neir vibes
[5:05:32] <fangovafang> Here go dat music
[5:05:35] <%Balkespower> yeah...
[5:05:36] <major_gnuisance> This far in and Woolie still doesn't understand the concept of COVER if there isn't an explicit cover system
[5:05:40] <%RioGascar> This area also can take framerates
[5:05:45] <EDFscout> not really?
[5:05:47] <%Balkespower> this arena could have been done better
[5:05:48] <%Javaa01> No he didn't get to the center
[5:05:48] <%RioGascar> Cause lots of physics objects
[5:06:02] <%Balkespower> F
[5:06:04] <jackelzxaa> go inside woolie
[5:06:04] <EDFscout> go inside!
[5:06:06] <%Irridium> you know you can go in those
[5:06:07] <Melchior_the_Wise> watch that health
[5:06:07] <Pistachius> this music PepePls
[5:06:07] <Lieutenant_America> You gotta head inside for cover
[5:06:08] <%Balkespower> get SOURCE'D
[5:06:13] <+deanbees> Oh no how far back ar- oh we're fine
[5:06:14] <%Gruhunchously> Rekt
[5:06:15] <+EldritchBee> Woolz youre getting shot while this is all going on
[5:06:30] <%Balkespower> the shields don't instakill you
[5:06:31] <+bear_breaker20> this is some larrBig larrHard larrGamer music
[5:06:35] <%Balkespower> but they deal damage
[5:06:38] <+therabbles> cover is for cowards just dodge the bullets
[5:06:39] <%Gruhunchously> Okay, maybe more like a experimental trance techno album cover
[5:06:43] <VJdarkworld> IN
[5:06:46] <+deanbees> Lol

[5:06:55] <%Balkespower> Way to go woolie
[5:06:56] <dukenux> oh god
[5:06:58] <chickenhunter> the music in this section is so good
[5:06:58] <+BNPhone> FPS BE LIKE
[5:06:59] <Lieutenant_America> Woolie is tearing the establishment apart from the inside
[5:07:00] <major_gnuisance> Wow, it's so much easier when you're not fully exposed to every enemy in the room at the same time!
[5:07:05] <%Gruhunchously> RIP Framerate
[5:07:12] <%BNPhone> This is my fav song in the entire game
[5:07:13] <jackelzxaa> wow woolie's pc is getting framerated. my pc is a beast so i didnt have problems here
[5:07:14] <%Balkespower> you can a controller now Woolie
[5:07:15] <%lotharrio> The aliens are 4th dimensionally attacking you, via frame rates!
[5:07:17] <%Balkespower> *kill
[5:07:18] <%derap41> Vey JJ Abrams music
[5:07:24] <VJdarkworld> this level was 10fps when i was playing it made it 10x harder, was still epic tho
[5:07:27] <%RioGascar> This is the games last big challenge
[5:07:29] <%Vorga1339> This has to be the last setpiece before the boss right?
[5:07:34] <%BNPhone> ye
[5:07:35] <%RioGascar> This is throwing everything at you
[5:07:39] <%Javaa01> You don't have to break all the panels, but don't touch them
[5:07:40] <crossing_mao> HOW EMBARRASSING
[5:07:54] <+PunJ0hn> oof
[5:08:01] <%Gruhunchously> Damn
[5:08:01] <pennykettle_> SourPls
[5:08:06] <Lieutenant_America> Time for heal footsies
[5:08:06] <jackelzxaa> thank god the game autosaves when you complete a stage objective
[5:08:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> This feels like destroying a dozen Mako Reactors in one go.
[5:08:22] <Lieutenant_America> @jackelzxaa If only it knew when you were on safe footing
[5:08:28] <EDFscout> shame when you are falling into a pit when you kill the last enemy
[5:08:28] <%lotharrio> Up
[5:08:29] <%Balkespower> crouch here
[5:08:29] <%Javaa01> Crouch
[5:08:39] <arran_throttle> Whoolie's number one enemy - jumping
[5:08:42] <crossing_mao> OOOOOPPSS
[5:08:45] <VJdarkworld> f
[5:08:49] <EDFscout> GRENADES
[5:08:51] <%BNPhone> forgot how to crouch
[5:08:59] <%Balkespower> ncie
[5:09:06] <jackelzxaa> this game does a good job at making you feel clever for solving it
[5:09:10] <jackelzxaa> they did a good half life
[5:09:19] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[5:09:22] <jackelzxaa> getting this alongside alyx made the inability to play alyx not hurt
[5:09:23] <major_gnuisance> Welcome back to Woolie Forgets His Basic Movement Options
[5:09:24] <%Gruhunchously> This set piece is pretty cool, not gonna lie
[5:09:25] <KRaZyAmmo> is this almost near the end?
[5:09:29] <%Balkespower> NICELY DONE
[5:09:29] <@akuda_bar> bitchsaves
[5:09:29] <%BNPhone> yea
[5:09:33] <%Balkespower> SMOKING SEXY STYLE!
[5:09:34] <%derap41> BWWAAAA
[5:09:35] <pennykettle_> I hope Half Life 2 doesnt seem weak after a section like this, this has to be the most intense thing Freeman has done
[5:09:38] <%RioGascar> You are not done still
[5:09:39] <Lieutenant_America> "Watch out! They're up to something..."

[5:10:17] <%Balkespower> THEY WON'T LET GET TO THE NIHILANTH!
[5:10:21] <dukenux> they pull you RIGHT IN
[5:10:23] <%Gruhunchously> They ain't finished yet
[5:10:24] <zamzoph> they seem upset
[5:10:25] <Drchandragupta> @pennykettle_ I think Woolie's gonna internalize that it'll get cooler later in HL2
[5:10:31] <%generalve> this final boss ?
[5:10:33] <dukenux> Must Protect F-Fatheeer
[5:10:34] <Drchandragupta> but I agree this sequence is cool
[5:10:34] <@Solidus_113> "this glass was protecting you FROM ME"
[5:10:34] <Lieutenant_America> Woolie figured it out fast
[5:10:39] <ralphfromdk> Chat, i do not remember this gun, it's new right?
[5:10:40] <%Gruhunchously> Alien barrels

[5:10:53] <VJdarkworld> "state rights" of xen
[5:10:54] <+therabbles> confederacy won't let it happen
[5:10:55] <%Javaa01> Nah, they just don't wanna get fucked in the ass by the Combine

[5:11:17] <ralphfromdk> Drchandragupta And that is what happens when you don't play something for over 10 years :p
[5:11:19] <%natebud> Valve confirmed that the final boss is Jefferson Davis
[5:11:20] <Rain_Mage> Woolie what are you a Galunga Lover?
[5:11:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> the war was actually about states' rights. states' rights to own slaves

[5:11:49] <2deep5u> GALUNGA UNCHAINED
[5:11:49] <jackelzxaa> i hope he does mmod update
[5:11:51] <Clowns> Gordon Freeman is based off of General Sherman, little known fact.
[5:11:51] <+deanbees> If woolie gets stuck within the next 5 minutes....I won't blame him because I honestly did too
[5:11:53] <dukenux> huh
[5:11:53] <@Solidus_113> stolen tech

[5:13:49] <crossing_mao> Is that... God...?
[5:13:51] <%Javaa01> Follow the blue lights
[5:13:53] <Lieutenant_America> Or it could be ours in a parallel universe
[5:13:57] <%RioGascar> I mean modeling wise
[5:13:58] <jackelzxaa> i was on fumes at this point so i forget if theres one last puzzle here or if woolie just has to crawl in a vent
[5:14:00] <%RioGascar> or texture
[5:14:02] <%RioGascar> Whatever
[5:14:03] <+therabbles> blue light is progression

[5:14:45] <EDFscout> button whiff!
[5:14:49] <Lieutenant_America> Like, the US couldn't beat all this
[5:14:50] <@Solidus_113> the hoomans were the wrong
[5:14:50] <%Gruhunchously> I mean, you're lucky you didn't get ganked the moment you teleported in here.
[5:14:50] <jackelzxaa> woolie's gonna have such an appreciation for hl2 when he moves on to it
[5:14:50] <jorniev> REAL BITCH WAS SLAVERY
[5:14:52] <MillaMoks> "The real bitch was the friends we made along the way"
[5:14:54] <%lotharrio> The real bitch was social inequality.
[5:14:54] <akman14> Were humans the fat evil all along?
[5:14:55] <%Balkespower> F
[5:14:55] <%Vorga1339> Woolie left his boss fountain in the test tube room, he's gotta load or progress now

[5:15:26] <Drchandragupta> Also is there a word other than "alien" for extradimension beings, not just extraterristral?
[5:15:27] <%derap41> no
[5:15:28] <KRaZyAmmo> who gave zenomorphs techonology

[5:19:05] <alrobot2014> do you start with full ammo if you load the chapter from the menu?
[5:19:06] <%Balkespower> this took me like 5 minutes to figure it ou
[5:19:06] <%natebud> What ammo? LUL
[5:19:13] <jackelzxaa> chuckles, mockingly
[5:19:13] <+deanbees> You always have your bug gun

[5:19:51] <VJdarkworld> freeeeeeeeeeemaaaaaaaaan
[5:19:55] <Lieutenant_America> Sadly they cut out a few of Nihilanth's lines in this. Probably because those lines played when he teleports you.
[5:19:56] <jackelzxaa> actual good last boss instead of the awkward version from the original game
[5:19:56] <pennykettle_> Nihilanth watches Rick and Morty
[5:19:59] <%GraceTBM> There's ammo and health crystals as well as teleported in ammo drops
[5:19:59] <jackelzxaa> man i'm so excited
[5:20:00] <%Balkespower> Nice one Woolie!
[5:20:02] <dukenux> "[chuckles] You fool. You absolute buffoon"

[5:20:13] <alrobot2014> scientists coming in clutch
[5:20:15] <@Solidus_113> METROID
[5:20:21] <%lotharrio> Oh, just pieces of Black Mesa getting teleported in, wholesale. Neat.
[5:20:25] <+therabbles> this is much better than the original fight
[5:20:27] <+therabbles> so far
[5:20:30] <jackelzxaa> will he figure it out
[5:20:30] <%Balkespower> Shoot the crytsals!
[5:20:30] <Lieutenant_America> @lotharrio Just wait
[5:20:31] <%RioGascar> He is literally teleporting parts of black mesa in
[5:20:32] <jackelzxaa> dont tell him
[5:20:32] <%derap41> Kill the space fetus
[5:20:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> Look around WOOLIE

[5:20:52] <%BNPhone> believe in woolie
[5:20:58] <dukenux> DansGame
[5:21:00] <pennykettle_> YOOOOOO
[5:21:01] <KRaZyAmmo> crystals
[5:21:01] <jackelzxaa> the rocket is so tiny when it finally reaches him
[5:21:01] <%skylerpilot> that was a police car
[5:21:04] <pennykettle_> WAS THAT A COP CAR
[5:21:07] <jackelzxaa> he warps in glados
[5:21:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> FUCK EM UUUP
[5:21:07] <%ChoculaUltra> there is something absolutely hilarious about a dude shooting a space god-like entity with a stock mp5
[5:21:07] <+Pyroclase> he's throiwing CARs at you, yes
[5:21:07] <+gustavozxd> for someone who loved the laser pointer with the rocket launcher, he sure isn't using it
[5:21:12] <%Balkespower> Now the Nihilanth is thinking with portals
[5:21:13] <Lieutenant_America> That Elder God is carrying a car!
[5:21:14] <%derap41> He's throwing forklifts
[5:21:18] <%Gruhunchously> Doesn't he Devil May Cry you into other bosses if he hits you?
[5:21:27] <%Balkespower> @Gruhunchously not this one
[5:21:30] <Lieutenant_America> @derap41 He tried to kill me with a forklift!
[5:21:37] <+Goobbue> they cut the teleporting thing in this
[5:21:37] <jackelzxaa> i'm so glad woolie's enjoying this as much as he is
[5:21:40] <%agumon9000> Do you have your passport?
[5:21:40] <dukenux> PogChamp
[5:21:44] <%Balkespower> @Gruhunchously they changed that here and I am super grateful for that
[5:21:44] <%agumon9000> Your not supposed to be here.
[5:21:45] <2deep5u> zoning
[5:21:46] <+therabbles> thank god they cut the teleporting
[5:21:54] <jackelzxaa> black mesa is a woolie style fps with air dashes and sick boss fights
[5:21:57] <+therabbles> the teleporting bloated the fuck out of the fight
[5:21:59] <Lieutenant_America> So, what's weird is that the OG Nihilanth stage was big... but VERTICALLY big. This is HORIZONTALLY big.
[5:22:01] <%Tuna_Can_0> D:

[5:38:12] <Lieutenant_America> Funny thing is, in OG HL1, he doesn't stop time or walk on air.
[5:38:13] <Shammas_> 13 years of blue balls atpFeelsBeardMan

[5:38:29] <@Solidus_113> This is what GMan is famous for
[5:38:30] <%RioGascar> He does it to the most terrifying degree in ep2
[5:38:31] <%ChoculaUltra> the stutter is GMan trying to not snap reality in half with his powers, obviously Kappa
[5:38:32] <jackelzxaa> "I guess we start the multiplayer now"
[5:38:33] <%derap41> G man is very David Lynchian

[5:40:05] <%Balkespower> @nawji yes he did. this was revealed in HL2 EP2 by Eli
[5:40:05] <%Gruhunchously> Something of a comedown from a Phd Physicist
[5:40:05] <+bear_breaker20> atleast 1 god killed minimum requirement
[5:40:07] <MyNameIsRasus> It sure would be the worst if the game that would answer that question was never going to come out

[5:40:30] <+theKingRamses> the answers lie in half life 2
[5:40:31] <Hothead7> It just gets better with the later games
[5:40:34] <Visorak6> HL2
[5:40:34] <+sagewuv> it's like a stockholder video
[5:40:35] <DatAsuna> 1998
[5:40:36] <%ChoculaUltra> Hugh Laurie as Gordon Freeman in a HL mini-series. Do it.
[5:40:36] <%Javaa01> And it took 6 years
[5:40:37] <@Solidus_113> THE WAIT
[5:40:37] <Drchandragupta> Gman is one of my favorite mysteries in anything

[5:40:51] <%Tuna_Can_0> HL fans are the most blue balled fans
[5:40:52] <%RioGascar> They waited 6 years
[5:40:52] <+bear_breaker20> HL2 would be dope

[5:41:15] <RunningNGunning> Half Life is THE BALL TINGLER series
[5:41:16] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus it worked here, so why not everywhere else?
[5:41:16] <%ChoculaUltra> Halo 2 had the best ball tingler of all time DON'T @ ME
[5:41:20] <jackelzxaa> titanfall 2 is HEAVILY inspired by the half life series
[5:41:21] <darkbotle> Now imagine having those questions for DECADES
[5:41:21] <+gustavozxd> well.......
[5:41:25] <Visorak6> Oh believe me is goes somewhere
[5:41:25] <+EldritchBee> @Binary_Fireball thats the whole point of the LP
[5:41:30] <Saffry_Ruzin> Halo 2 did it hard
[5:41:32] <%derap41> @RunningNGunning its the Cock and ball torture series
[5:41:33] <trianglehat> eh this is not really cliffhanger, more of a hook for sequel
[5:41:36] <Drchandragupta> @ChoculaUltra I RESPECT YOUR OPINION NERD
[5:41:36] <VJdarkworld> the freeeeee man
[5:41:37] <pennykettle_> Imagine not ever hearing of the gman and suddenly that is the ending. Out of no where @WoolieVersus
[5:41:38] <jackelzxaa> crowbar man is the savior
[5:41:38] <EDFscout> he is SOMETHING
[5:41:38] <Pistachius> Blue Shift and Opposing force are pretty goos. should play them @woolieversus
[5:41:39] <@akuda_bar> The Freeman
[5:41:42] <%Gruhunchously> Oh it goes somewhere. Somewhere weird, mind.
[5:41:42] <jackelzxaa> the one free man
[5:41:42] <%RioGascar> some questions should not be answered
[5:41:48] <+EldritchBee> Mister. Freeeman.
[5:41:50] <resloxxx> Sellout! LUL
[5:41:51] <RunningNGunning> @derap41 well after Episode 2
[5:41:52] <%skylerpilot> yeah, "Finishing this fight" is a pretty big tease of an ending too
[5:41:52] <+Grayhammatter> THE Freeman
[5:41:53] <+TDotGoat> Crowbar PHD
[5:41:54] <Lieutenant_America> Wait into Woolie sees the absolute state of things in HL2
[5:41:58] <%Tuna_Can_0> Good job you fought the Cthulu god, now you got hired by gods god
[5:41:58] <+gustavozxd> that final boss was sick
[5:41:58] <@Solidus_113> I don't want the backstory to Gman
[5:41:58] <%agumon9000> Hello Gordon!
[5:42:00] <%eanscrale> It goes somewhere, but some of your questions will remain shrouded in mystery.
[5:42:02] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus look at a youtube video of original Xen and final boss
[5:42:03] <a_mad_dragon> OPPOSING FORCE
[5:42:05] <%derap41> You doing those?
[5:42:06] <%Gruhunchously> Gordon basically kicked so much ass he ascended to godhood
[5:42:07] <vanderbolt777> Wath out Gordan, there are ropes ahead
[5:42:08] <Camail> NEVER 3
[5:42:08] <HitchhikingThrough> @a_mad_dragon fuck off
[5:42:09] <Camail> EVER
[5:42:10] <+Pyroclase> Episode 2 has the WORST ENDING
[5:42:10] <+YabbaTroll> Adventures?
[5:42:11] <goldstein3r> Now he's qualified to dual-wield crowbars
[5:42:12] <pennykettle_> FeelsAmazingMan
[5:42:12] <+bear_breaker20> never ever
[5:42:13] <+RueOrin> Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Episode 2, Alyx
[5:42:14] <MyNameIsRasus> NEVER
[5:42:14] <aeonicvector> Hl2, then EP1, 2, Alyx, Hunt down the Freeman
[5:42:15] <jorniev> and then alyc
[5:42:16] <@Solidus_113> Blue Shift
[5:42:16] <jackelzxaa> half life 2, ep1, ep2, alyx
[5:42:17] <%agumon9000> Have a soda...it will help you see faster
[5:42:17] <+Deko_> blue shift
[5:42:17] <Finaldragoon> Blue Shift
[5:42:17] <jorniev> s
[5:42:18] <+some_brave_apollo> blue shift
[5:42:18] <TigerClaws12> blue shift
[5:42:18] <%Javaa01> BLUE SHIFT
[5:42:18] <Zeemod155> ehhhh
[5:42:18] <+gustavozxd> oh no don't
[5:42:20] <Visorak6> Blue sift
[5:42:20] <SixthSun2> Opposing Force and Blue Shift
[5:42:20] <%MaddyCaddy> You don't have to play those
[5:42:20] <dukenux> Blue Shift
[5:42:21] <%derap41> 3 is the biggest pain there is
[5:42:22] <@akuda_bar> Half Life Revengeance
[5:42:22] <jorniev> alyx
[5:42:22] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus So do you know anything about Half Life 2's premise? Not going to say, just curious
[5:42:23] <resloxxx> Never ever EVER BABY
[5:42:23] <fangovafang> Gordon the Freeman
[5:42:24] <Drchandragupta> Don't forget Decay! Or maybe do
[5:42:25] <+gustavozxd> don't even waste your time on those
[5:42:27] <+Goobbue> There's also Decay for the PS2
[5:42:27] <%lotharrio> Blue Shift and Decay...
[5:42:28] <Camail> YabbaTroll joke about sonic adventures
[5:42:32] <Lieutenant_America> Never cared much for Opposing Force
[5:42:34] <RunningNGunning> The DLC is optional though
[5:42:34] <+Kiaayo> opposing force and blue shift were good at the time but it'll be rough after black mesa
[5:42:38] <+Grayhammatter> The Pizzas PogChamp
[5:42:41] <%Gruhunchously> You don't have to play those.
[5:42:44] <%Tuna_Can_0> Clap
[5:42:45] <dukenux> Oh and there's also Decay which is a COOP PS2 exclusive??
[5:42:46] <%lotharrio> Blue shift is the only one that you might want to play. It's short, too.
[5:42:50] <+Deko_> jank is part of the experience
[5:42:51] <%agumon9000> Look Gordon! Ropes! We can use these to help with large pits.
[5:42:51] <jackelzxaa> hl2update:mmod and episodes1&2:mmod
[5:42:52] <TigerClaws12> source baybee
[5:42:53] <%derap41> But it was also there in the original
[5:42:54] <Pistachius> Blue Shift
[5:42:54] <%MaddyCaddy> HL2 has proper controller support
[5:42:55] <%Tuna_Can_0> GabeN Can't escape me
[5:42:56] <%Exyoh> Blue Shift is just what Barney was up to. You don't need OpFor
[5:42:56] <Camail> yea dont play original hl1 in any capacity
[5:42:57] <vanderbolt777> PogChamp
[5:43:00] <%derap41> So its authentic
[5:43:00] <+Grayhammatter> source baby
[5:43:01] <Visorak6> Blue shift explains how certain NPCs survived and opposing force is not important to the canon
[5:43:02] <Saffry_Ruzin> I say go straight into Half Life 2
[5:43:05] <TigerClaws12> Woolie vs bugs
[5:43:07] <RunningNGunning> Source working as intended you mean Kappa
[5:43:07] <+gustavozxd> B class atpRtsd
[5:43:15] <+YabbaTroll> @Camail gotcha
[5:43:16] <Lieutenant_America> The wild thing: 1.0 is WAY less janky than Early Access.
[5:43:18] <Drchandragupta> @Bighat_The_Star_Nomad big agree but you know he won't
[5:43:19] <vanderbolt777> Hello Gordan
[5:43:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Please fix immediatly
[5:43:32] <%gatorafan> What do you mean? Getting hit by GER was totally intentional Kappa
[5:43:33] <%agumon9000> Look Gordon! Ropes! We can use these to help with large pits.
[5:43:33] <Saffry_Ruzin> Probably
[5:43:42] <EDFscout> @Lieutenant_America ?did you get that wrong?
[5:43:43] <%RioGascar> I would say go into half life 2 next whenever you decide dont do the old expansions cause they are still on half life 1’s engine
[5:43:50] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:43:50] <+EldritchBee> But did you bring your passport @WoolieVersus
[5:43:51] <%Tuna_Can_0> Unintentional Diavolo'd
[5:43:52] <+gustavozxd> wha
[5:43:53] <+Deko_> LUL
[5:43:56] <+therabbles> Gulanga
[5:43:56] <$arcielardor> galunga
[5:43:58] <+Buzzkill983> Wha
[5:44:03] <%Irridium> yeah you can honestly skip the half life 1 expansions
[5:44:04] <+Grayhammatter> galunga
[5:44:05] <%agumon9000> Do you have your id and your Pass Port?
[5:44:06] <mikash91> gratz
[5:44:07] <%Tuna_Can_0> PogChamp
[5:44:07] <Visorak6> Now do HL2
[5:44:08] <shamuzu> wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha-
[5:44:08] <%lotharrio> Opposing Force is basically not really canon, for now. It could get retconned in. Blue Shift gives you the canon Barney and how he/some characters escape Black Mesa. Decay shows how they slowed down the Xen invasion for a bit.
[5:44:09] <%BNPhone> You beat Black Mesa not Half Life
[5:44:11] <+YabbaTroll> gamer cred : EARNED
[5:44:11] <jackelzxaa> the expansions weren't made by valve and are kind of something you can play or not without losing anything
[5:44:12] <%Balkespower> Congratulations
[5:44:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Congratulations Woolz!
[5:44:13] <Drchandragupta> story wise the expansions are skippable
[5:44:13] <%Gruhunchously> It's going to be so weird going into Half Life 2 with your only experience being Black Mesa.
[5:44:15] <VJdarkworld> gaaan galuuun galungaa
[5:44:16] <%derap41> Only 22 years late
[5:44:16] <EDFscout> G A L U N G A
[5:44:17] <+gustavozxd> now for vanilla 1 MiniK
[5:44:19] <jackelzxaa> episodes 1 and 2 are just more canon though
[5:44:19] <Hothead7> HL2?
[5:44:20] <vanderbolt777> Where is your passport
[5:44:22] <+bear_breaker20> gamer card gets a stamp woolz
[5:44:24] <PsychedelicSnake> You can skip the HL1 expansions. You can go right to 2 and its episodes
[5:44:26] <%RioGascar> Congrats woolie
[5:44:28] <+Slimshazbot> I'm really curious to see what you think of 2. It's a very VERY different setting and tone.
[5:44:30] <jorniev> half life 2 coming in 6 years
[5:44:30] <CookieDoughFK> Congratulations!
[5:44:33] <pennykettle_> Really? I thought that final sequence was ugly visual effect clutter
[5:44:37] <%Balkespower> You gotta love HL2's Soundtrack, Woolie!
[5:44:38] <%BNPhone> The HL1 expansions are in Canon Limbo
[5:44:43] <Ashenik1> Will we ever get witcher 3 lp though :<
[5:44:49] <%derap41> Nah First 2 chapters are best
[5:44:54] <jackelzxaa> hl2 is a step down in some ways unless you use mmod update tho, which i think is what's planned?
[5:44:58] <jorniev> first has to play witcher 1
[5:45:05] <%BNPhone> no @jackelzxaa
[5:45:08] <EDFscout> hunt down the C O U G H
[5:45:12] <gunsrlove> not really @jorniev
[5:45:12] <jackelzxaa> its come up is what i meant
[5:45:16] <VJdarkworld> and that final xen part is completely new too
[5:45:17] <DatAsuna> Please
[5:45:17] <%Tuna_Can_0> OG Half life 2 is fine
[5:45:17] <%RioGascar> Half life 2 vanilla or update are just fine
[5:45:19] <%Balkespower> Half Life 2 Update is good enough
[5:45:21] <%Irridium> nah HL2 vanilla's fine enough
[5:45:22] <%BNPhone> OG HL2 is fine
[5:45:23] <jackelzxaa> mmod is good
[5:45:23] <vanderbolt777> Hello Gordan
[5:45:25] <%derap41> @jorniev Really don't have to play 1 or 2 to play 3 its self contained
[5:45:25] <%aceleapc> Calling HL2 a step down from this is honestly just insane
[5:45:27] <DatAsuna> I far preferring aking bad shit good over just ignoring it
[5:45:30] <%Gruhunchously> DMC 2 but good...that's an idea.
[5:45:30] <jackelzxaa> it makes the gunplay much more fun
[5:45:31] <+therabbles> vanilla Half life 2 holds up
[5:45:32] <%GraceTBM> what if DMC Strive was implemented but for DMC2 LUL
[5:45:32] <DatAsuna> It's the true challenge
[5:45:33] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Since you finished HL1 you should take a look at Half Life VR: AI. Its not Alyx its the original Half Life 1 but in VR
[5:45:33] <PsychedelicSnake> Ignore MMOD entirely
[5:45:33] <Gorshum> LUL
[5:45:33] <%generalve> NOM NOM
[5:45:36] <jorniev> id rather woolie played fallout new vegas or disco elysium
[5:45:37] <%MaddyCaddy> Good game
[5:45:38] <jackelzxaa> vanilla hl2 doesnt really hold up so well
[5:45:39] <Drchandragupta> I don't think modding HL2 is necessary in any way unless it's a second playthrough
[5:45:40] <Ashenik1> doest have to play 1 and 2 casue joseph has done a woderfull job summarising them ;p

[5:46:20] <+deanbees> Time to wake up and smell the ashes bois!
[5:46:21] <jackelzxaa> i went back and forth for a while and landed on "MMOD is the perfect followup to Black Mesa"
[5:46:26] <ZE_Count> How is the cube woolie?
[5:46:26] <OldOnyx> Well, Woolie would probably like HL2 more than Eternal
[5:46:28] <jackelzxaa> base hl2 has really bad shooting compared to black mesa
[5:46:28] <$arcielardor> oh we jumping right in?
[5:46:28] <%BNPhone> listen to half life 1 credits music LUL
[5:46:29] <fangovafang> the cube
[5:46:33] <Ashenik1> Thronebreaker is a fun card game and awesome witcher story
[5:46:39] <jorniev> there are half life 2 haters?
[5:46:44] <%GraceTBM> hl2 doesn't hold up on replay very well cause there's a lot of just transit, as well as a lot of scripted sequences and conversations that you just have to sit through
[5:46:47] <%Balkespower> Just play HL2 Vanilla or HL2 Update for better visuals, @WoolieVersus
[5:46:49] <VJdarkworld> !MOTIVATED
[5:46:49] <@Moobot> 870 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:46:50] <%derap41> Xen started strong felt a bit long then got good again
[5:46:50] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus Just a fair warning that HL2 is stepping back to 2004 :V
[5:46:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus In the normal game xen is shorter but FUCKING WORSE
[5:46:53] <+Pyroclase> A lot of people think HL2 hasn't aged well, which is bull
[5:46:54] <jackelzxaa> hl2's non gravity gun stuff is weak but mmod makes the non gravity gun stuff (regular shooting) actually radical
[5:46:56] <+Nanani1990> who's playing half life 2 tho
[5:47:08] <Camail> mama was in the original, and the boss was in the original
[5:47:09] <+EldritchBee> !MOTIVATED
[5:47:09] <@Moobot> 871 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:47:10] <%GraceTBM> I feel like the first section of Xen is better than the last half, the wildlife and plantlife is way cooler
[5:47:14] <+gustavozxd> i'm gonna play it again along with the LP
[5:47:14] <%Gruhunchously> Half Life 2 is as much a piece of history as Half Life 1. All the physics bullshit we take for granted now was brand new back then.
[5:47:17] <%generalve> HLF1 Better campaign while HLF2 Has everything else better
[5:47:18] <%RioGascar> half life 2’s design still holds up fantastically well
[5:47:26] <+Slimshazbot> @Pyroclase It holds up but it the age really does show
[5:47:27] <%aceleapc> comparing mmod to black mesa is some a bad comparison because one is a mod that rehauls the gameplay and the other is an entire remake and reimagining of the game itself
[5:47:28] <Visorak6> The final fight was still pretty good in the original
[5:47:32] <@Solidus_113> DAHKNESS
[5:47:32] <%Tuna_Can_0> @GraceTBM yea but for someones first exposure that stuff might appear interesting
[5:47:32] <%generalve> lol
[5:47:35] <%Balkespower> Now the combine is gonna fuck up the earth now
[5:47:35] <PsychedelicSnake> OG Xen isn't terrible. It's an average compared to the rest of the game's great
[5:47:36] <dukenux> HL2 is story heavy. It might be to its detriment on repetitive playthroughs, but first time it;s amazing
[5:47:38] <mikash91> it wasn't that bad 'cause xen was way shorter
[5:47:38] <%ChoculaUltra> talking in the daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaark
[5:47:39] <%BNPhone> MMOD adding ads doesnt make the game better LUL
[5:47:39] <+Grayhammatter> DAHKNESS
[5:47:39] <AppleBerryKitty> im with woolie my eyes hurt as well.
[5:47:39] <dukenux> IMPRISONING ME
[5:47:40] <jackelzxaa> the hl2 design is good but the gunplay is bad
[5:47:45] <OldOnyx> Eternal removes stuff he likes from 2016 while HL2 plays straight in to the shit he was talking about this entire playthrough
[5:47:46] <%RioGascar> the ending was still pretty good
[5:47:47] <jackelzxaa> mmod odesnt add ads
[5:47:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:47:47] <%ChoculaUltra> real darkness hours
[5:47:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> ALL THAT I SEE
[5:47:52] <jackelzxaa> mmod changes how gunplay feels

[5:47:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[5:47:53] <puluxor> vanilla Xen wasn't that bad. Jesus stop memeing
[5:47:54] <dukenux> ABSOLUTE HORROR
[5:47:56] <VJdarkworld> mmod is great for a replay through. vanilla hl2 is fine
[5:47:58] <jackelzxaa> and makes it look and feel more like black mesa
[5:48:01] <jackelzxaa> it doesnt add enemies
[5:48:04] <jackelzxaa> no it isnt rofl
[5:48:05] <darkbotle> HL2 Pulse rifle is the goddess of machine guns
[5:48:07] <%Irridium> That's the thing people are recommending mmod because on replays it's fun but for the first time through? Vanilla is perfectly fine
[5:48:13] <%BinaryFireball> vanilla xen was there
[5:48:13] <jackelzxaa> mmod is better for someone coming off of black mesa
[5:48:17] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus I mean Xen wasn't great but its nowhere near as bad as you're assuming :V
[5:48:19] <zocano> Vanilla Xen starts good and then rapidly loses momentum and grinds
[5:48:20] <%Exyoh> Xen had pacing & pathing issues, but its main issue was aging badly
[5:48:27] <Saffry_Ruzin> AR3 is the best gun
[5:48:28] <%RioGascar> vanilla half life 2 for an lp will be perfectly fine
[5:48:29] <%Javaa01> @darkbotle Because it's just the CS:S AK47 in disguise
[5:48:29] <Monkeyweed21> Xen was a bad quake level
[5:48:29] <PsychedelicSnake> what no
[5:48:31] <%lotharrio> HL2's rocket duels, mini-tactics games, survival horror elements and sniper battles are all pretty great.
[5:48:32] <Zayasu> woolieWUT_BN
[5:48:32] <EDFscout> Watch HL1 xen playthrough lol
[5:48:33] <%BNPhone> Vanilla is fine for a first go stop trying to change the game for my mans LUL
[5:48:33] <%Gruhunchously> Original Xen wasn't great
[5:48:34] <%derap41> Xen was so bad compared to the earlier chapters
[5:48:35] <%GraceTBM> xen was muddy, confusing, ugly, and tedious
[5:48:40] <RunningNGunning> It would be good to keep in mind though that HL2 was made during the beginning of Source's creation and Black Mesa was made wayyy after the fact
[5:48:44] <%RioGascar> i mean they didnt get long to hate it
[5:48:46] <+Pyroclase> Woolie, are you gonna play HL2 update? It's basically a community bugfix
[5:48:47] <EDFscout> ye
[5:48:47] <jackelzxaa> no it isnt. vanilla is good in 2008
[5:48:47] <%RioGascar> 1 hour
[5:48:49] <+gustavozxd> you totally should
[5:48:51] <jackelzxaa> vanilla isn't good in 2020
[5:48:52] <%ChoculaUltra> I hate Xen. It's so rough and course and gets everywhere.
[5:48:56] <+gutlesscoward> show us the picture
[5:48:57] <@Solidus_113> floating islands on a skybox
[5:48:59] <goldstein3r> I didn't mind original Xen, at least before the factory
[5:49:02] <jackelzxaa> i ran vanilla and then mmod and i was like "okay mmod is the way to go"
[5:49:04] <%aceleapc> vanilla HL2 is fine, for someone who wants to experience what half life is all about, mmod is not the way to go
[5:49:07] <resloxxx> @jackelzxaa Literally only you dude LUL
[5:49:07] <%BNPhone> yes it is you're just straigh wrong my guy @jackelzxaa
[5:49:07] <Melchior_the_Wise> Old Xen was bad but short, This xen is okay, bt WAY TOOO LONG
[5:49:12] <%GraceTBM> vanilla is fine as an initial experience, it just doesn't compete with modern games at all
[5:49:14] <jackelzxaa> yeah i'm the only one who played it
[5:49:17] <Drchandragupta> HL2 vanilla holds the heck up to me. Personally I don't enjoy the aesthetics of mmod
[5:49:19] <%BinaryFireball> HL2 was crap when it came out and crap today
[5:49:20] <%derap41> Old xen is a brown mess
[5:49:21] <+gustavozxd> eh I played vanilla hl2 for the first time some months ago and it was fine @jackelzxaa
[5:49:21] <jackelzxaa> so i'm the only one with the correct oppinion
[5:49:25] <RunningNGunning> Xen is fine if you know how to bunnyhop through it, otherwise its completely shit
[5:49:27] <+Pyroclase> HL1 Xen is just, "alienrockwall.jpg"
[5:49:28] <PsychedelicSnake> Well yeah of course the old game is going to look different than the new thing
[5:49:29] <+Blackjackal95> Vanilla isn't bad
[5:49:29] <HitchhikingThrough> it was terrible
[5:49:34] <%Tuna_Can_0> they did their best FeelsBadMan
[5:49:35] <%BinaryFireball> HL2 is a boring grey physics demo
[5:49:35] <jackelzxaa> vanilla is bad gunplay
[5:49:36] <VJdarkworld> floating rocks PogChamp
[5:49:38] <jackelzxaa> the shooting is really bad
[5:49:38] <%aceleapc> if you think HL2 doesn't hold up then honest i think you don't like half life
[5:49:39] <%lotharrio> I legit don't understand people who hate HL2.
[5:49:42] <jackelzxaa> it is just sponge shooting
[5:49:45] <dukenux> Yeah, MMOD looks like something for people who ALREADY PLAYED it
[5:49:46] <Clowns> HL2 was meh.
[5:49:49] <%RioGascar> xen was rushed cause valve had no time left
[5:49:50] <+gustavozxd> @jackelzxaa whatever makes you sleep at night buddy atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[5:49:51] <jackelzxaa> no not in black mesa woolie
[5:49:51] <%Javaa01> HL1 shooting is good
[5:49:55] <%BNPhone> when everyone calls out the one guy that one guy is you @jackelzxaa
[5:49:56] <jackelzxaa> we're not talking about what your'e talking about woolie
[5:49:57] <%RioGascar> and it heavily affected valve
[5:50:01] <Lewisisphat> HL2 is the goat
[5:50:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> This RE 2 Remake, Not Shadow Of the Colossus
[5:50:08] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus don't play MMOD, it's not worth it.

[5:50:18] <+deanbees> Vanilla should be fine.
[5:50:19] <Blooddimond> MMod is a combat overhaul, not a remake
[5:50:21] <shamuzu> PLAY VANILLA
[5:50:21] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus ignore chat, ask pat
[5:50:22] <+theKingRamses> hl2 vanilla is great
[5:50:22] <EDFscout> A facelift
[5:50:25] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus whenever you actually wanna get around to HL2 let me know, I'll do complete playthroughs of all the versions to help guide what to choose
[5:50:25] <jackelzxaa> there is nothing you lose by playing vanilla
[5:50:26] <+Grayhammatter> im hearing don't do mmod
[5:50:27] <vanderbolt777> Hello Gordan
[5:50:27] <%BinaryFireball> I am the one guy, HL2 is a piece of poop
[5:50:28] <+gustavozxd> ONE GUY
[5:50:28] <Drchandragupta> VANILLA
[5:50:29] <RunningNGunning> mmod is great, but I'd stick with Vanilla for first time
[5:50:31] <DisposableAgent6362> Despite what many of people here say, I highly recommend MMOD for HL2. It's just visual, gunplay and audio enhancement. No drastic changes that would ruin the experience.
[5:50:31] <+Zeiss_Schreiber> Vanilla

[5:50:44] <%KingOfTheGeats> Vanilla is still good
[5:50:45] <+gustavozxd> go Vanilla
[5:50:45] <%BinaryFireball> play quake instead
[5:50:47] <jackelzxaa> theres no reason to go for vanilla
[5:50:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Play whatever you want Woolies
[5:50:47] <+YabbaTroll> VANILLA
[5:50:49] <+EldritchBee> Just do vanilla, youll have less problems
[5:50:51] <Blooddimond> HL2 vanilla holds up fine
[5:50:51] <%BNPhone> vanilla is better for the first run, mmod is for later replays @WoolieVersus
[5:50:51] <JacexDowozWideo> VANILLA FIRST!
[5:50:51] <VJdarkworld> mmod if u want better gunplay, vanilla if u dont want to deal with mods
[5:50:52] <jackelzxaa> mmod is just the same game but more fun
[5:50:54] <+gustavozxd> IT'S NOT
[5:50:55] <+gutlesscoward> DO GALUNGA
[5:50:55] <%chiluzza> theres a Mod that makes half life 2 Multiplayer
[5:50:56] <@akuda_bar> it's not dated AT ALL
[5:50:57] <+Pyroclase> VAnilla is NOT dated
[5:50:58] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus MMOD fucks with the combat sandbox A LOT. HL2 Update is just vanilla, but with nicer environment lighting and shadows
[5:50:58] <DatAsuna> This is HL1 updated, vanilla is old 04 shit
[5:50:59] <%Haarute> it's not dated.
[5:50:59] <+Buzzkill983> I don't care what he chooses, as long as Woolie enjoys the game
[5:51:00] <Lewisisphat> it's really not
[5:51:00] <Zayasu> its not i played it recently
[5:51:01] <%generalve> who the fuck recommends mod first ?
[5:51:01] <PsychedelicSnake> Vanilla preserves the feel of the game, like Black Mesa to OG HL1. MMod straight up changes the feeling
[5:51:02] <+queenghidora> VANILLA
[5:51:02] <jackelzxaa> vanilla is dated shootingwise
[5:51:03] <vanderbolt777> VoteYea
[5:51:03] <EDFscout> not really
[5:51:04] <Melchior_the_Wise> It won't
[5:51:04] <DatAsuna> vanilla is super dated
[5:51:05] <+EldritchBee> its not dated very much at all
[5:51:05] <jackelzxaa> they're the same game woolie
[5:51:05] <+Pyroclase> no
[5:51:06] <UnfilteredComic> no
[5:51:06] <+theKingRamses> it's not dated
[5:51:07] <+Slimshazbot> Its not too dated just kinda basic
[5:51:07] <+gustavozxd> I played half life 2 for the first time THIS YEAR and it was fine
[5:51:08] <EDFscout> no
[5:51:08] <%MaddyCaddy> Just guns
[5:51:09] <DatAsuna> it was shit 8 years ago
[5:51:09] <+Blackjackal95> Mods won't make it not dated
[5:51:09] <RunningNGunning> no
[5:51:09] <+YabbaTroll> the jank makes it better
[5:51:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its a little jank but not to dated
[5:51:10] <%Balkespower> it is not dated at all @WoolieVersus
[5:51:11] <jackelzxaa> but mmod is better shooting and visuals
[5:51:11] <%GraceTBM> @chiluzza Hl2 Deathmatch is a full product
[5:51:11] <%BNPhone> it changes the gameplay and adds weapons and shit
[5:51:12] <%Tuna_Can_0> not really
[5:51:12] <+Pyroclase> MMOd only changes guns and one enemy type
[5:51:13] <DatAsuna> it's worse today
[5:51:13] <%derap41> Its not a total overhaul
[5:51:15] <%aceleapc> vanilla is not dated
[5:51:15] <+Deko_> isnt it just graphic stuff
[5:51:16] <@Solidus_113> MMod is mostly just guns
[5:51:17] <Visorak6> You have to consider that people have extremely strong feelings about HL2
[5:51:17] <cero_5> played it just a few weeks ago, not outdated at all
[5:51:18] <UnfilteredComic> better guns
[5:51:18] <%KingOfTheGeats> mod has better gunplay
[5:51:19] <jackelzxaa> mmod changes the way guns feel
[5:51:19] <%RioGascar> You can do half life 2 update then
[5:51:19] <+Kiaayo> do your own research, don't listen to chat
[5:51:19] <Drchandragupta> MMOD makes gameplay changes too that I do not feel are to the benefit of the game
[5:51:20] <DisposableAgent6362> Don't let the vanilla bois overturn rational thinking, honestly.
[5:51:21] <ghorko> MMOD just changes weapons
[5:51:25] <Hegelundra> Vanilla IS Better
[5:51:29] <VJdarkworld> mmod essentially makes the gunplay like FEAR which is cool
[5:51:29] <jackelzxaa> its the same guns but they play better
[5:51:31] <%RioGascar> Which is a patch to update it
[5:51:31] <Gallegor_> cinematic mod Keepo
[5:51:31] <trianglehat> HL2 is good as is, play vanilla
[5:51:33] <+sir_louis> LUL
[5:51:33] <%Haarute> just do vanilla.
[5:51:33] <PsychedelicSnake> "better"
[5:51:34] <+Deko_> oof LUL
[5:51:34] <%Tuna_Can_0> SMOD PogChamp
[5:51:34] <@akuda_bar> they're not "better" really
[5:51:36] <Lieutenant_America> MMod adds unlimted sprint
[5:51:37] <+gustavozxd> REGGIE atpRtsd
[5:51:39] <+Nanani1990> if you can't aim you need better guns woolz
[5:51:39] <+pedrothecruel> NO
[5:51:41] <shamuzu> "better"
[5:51:41] <%GraceTBM> It'll feel better with MMOD, but you won't get the classic gameplay experience
[5:51:42] <%MaddyCaddy> Nothing
[5:51:42] <+EldritchBee> Vanilla is fine guys
[5:51:44] <DisposableAgent6362> Nothing
[5:51:45] <+Zeiss_Schreiber> You need a keyboard LUL
[5:51:46] <%Irridium> It's the original experience
[5:51:46] <Visorak6> Nothing
[5:51:46] <vanderbolt777> Gordan I'm thirsty
[5:51:46] <AppleBerryKitty> mmod looks more like new gun animations is all im seeing
[5:51:47] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus what grace said
[5:51:48] <EDFscout> uhh...
[5:51:49] <@Solidus_113> It's ORIGINAL
[5:51:49] <DisposableAgent6362> Literally nothing lol
[5:51:49] <jackelzxaa> vanilla is just for people who are nostalgic
[5:51:49] <Hegelundra> Mmod looks gross
[5:51:50] <+Pyroclase> MMOD makes the soldiers much more dangerous, which among other things makes your NPC allies nearly useless, they drop like flies
[5:51:51] <%GraceTBM> Vanilla does nothing better
[5:51:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Guns feel smoother in Mmod but BM has similar to HL2
[5:51:51] <Daba_mk2> nothing
[5:51:52] <@akuda_bar> Not the original
[5:51:52] <%KingOfTheGeats> uhhh
[5:51:52] <+theKingRamses> you just click play
[5:51:53] <+EldritchBee> its the original experience
[5:51:53] <trianglehat> it's the real deal, no MMod bloat
[5:51:55] <yeildingthought> LUL
[5:51:55] <UnfilteredComic> its exactly the same, with slightly lesser guns
[5:51:57] <VJdarkworld> vanilla means u dont need to fiddle with settings
[5:51:58] <sleepy_pixels> Balence
[5:52:00] <JacexDowozWideo> it doesn't add questionable changes
[5:52:01] <%Haarute> mmod is more like a bonus if you want to run a replay.
[5:52:02] <Owlboy7> @WoolieVersus MMOD ADD COOL ANIMATIONS TO WEAPONS
[5:52:02] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[5:52:04] <+Deko_> LUL
[5:52:06] <major_gnuisance> Being tainted by fans
[5:52:07] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:52:07] <%Gruhunchously> Better Balanced
[5:52:08] <+VietcongSamurai> LUL
[5:52:08] <Visorak6> Vanilla is absolutely for nostalgia
[5:52:08] <EDFscout> LUL
[5:52:08] <jackelzxaa> mmod is good for first timers too
[5:52:08] <%BNPhone> Why would you not use original for the first run? @WoolieVersus
[5:52:10] <%BinaryFireball> HL2 is crap it doesnt matter
[5:52:11] <+sir_louis> MOD MAKES YOU A SECODNARY
[5:52:11] <%Balkespower> If you want better visuals and bug fixing use Half Life 2 Update @WoolieVersus
[5:52:12] <vanderbolt777> Hello Gordan
[5:52:13] <jorniev> do not get tactical
[5:52:13] <jackelzxaa> you dont lose anything doing mmod
[5:52:14] <+gustavozxd> LUL
[5:52:14] <DisposableAgent6362> Nostalgia is just folling people here.
[5:52:16] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus just read all the posts we make in stupid voices from now on this is great
[5:52:18] <%generalve> do you know how many GOTY HL2 Won in 2004 ? stick to vanilla
[5:52:19] <jackelzxaa> and no one can explain one downside to mmod
[5:52:20] <%derap41> Vanilla means worse weapons and that's it its just the hassel of installing it
[5:52:21] <%aceleapc> mmod is good for replaying to get a fresh experience but you should definitely play vanilla first
[5:52:21] <%GraceTBM> Just watch a comparison video to see what you think
[5:52:22] <HitchhikingThrough> YA KNOW
[5:52:24] <HitchhikingThrough> he's not wrong
[5:52:25] <%BinaryFireball> Someone tell me what is actually good about HL2
[5:52:25] <ghorko> Do the cinematic mod
[5:52:27] <DisposableAgent6362> @jackelzxaa Exactly, lol
[5:52:29] <Lieutenant_America> This may be the time to use a poll if you wanna let the viewers decide
[5:52:30] <%Haarute> just run a twitter poll
[5:52:31] <+theKingRamses> ask pat maybe
[5:52:31] <+EldritchBee> do you really want to hassle with mods or do you wanna play HL2
[5:52:33] <zamzoph> PLAY IT NOW
[5:52:33] <+gustavozxd> vanilla is fine
[5:52:34] <+deanbees> Woolie figures it out: Vanilla or mods
[5:52:34] <jackelzxaa> woolie probably wont play the game twice
[5:52:35] <%Irridium> Half Life 2 got big just fine without mmod, remember
[5:52:36] <pennykettle_> cinematic barbie doll alyx mod
[5:52:37] <Hegelundra> i played it for the first time three years ago and vanilla was just as good as other games of the same genre at the time
[5:52:37] <+YabbaTroll> woolie will figure it out
[5:52:38] <%lotharrio> Vanilla, HL2 Update, MMOD are the three options it seems. I got no dog in this fight.
[5:52:38] <HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus do your own research, play it your way
[5:52:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Read my post in dumb voice, Reggie-kun!
[5:52:39] <pennykettle_> do vanilla
[5:52:40] <jackelzxaa> he'll probably play one time so play mmod
[5:52:41] <+queenghidora> galunga
[5:52:42] <%RioGascar> you can do half life 2 update which is just updated half life 2 patched and shit for bug fixs and physics fixing and lighting
[5:52:44] <yeildingthought> Mario on all stars is better Kappa
[5:52:44] <goldstein3r> People make it sound like MMOD is the Brutal Doom to HL2
[5:52:46] <shamuzu> he will... figure it out
[5:52:48] <Daba_mk2> Woolie will figure it out
[5:52:52] <Ashenik1> HL2 vanila is okay but it is better afte you play the witcher 3 Kappa
[5:52:53] <CookieDoughFK> Doom Eternal ?
[5:52:53] <VJdarkworld> tho even to be fair, half life 2 was updated after orange box so its not even full "vanilla"
[5:52:54] <%Tuna_Can_0> its only if you dont want to spend time installing or w/e
[5:52:54] <jackelzxaa> woolie will figure it out
[5:52:55] <%Prevot> all stars isbway better
[5:52:56] <+YabbaTroll> @WoolieVersus just play crack life version
[5:52:56] <+therabbles> its history explore it
[5:52:57] <DisposableAgent6362> @WoolieVersus If people are bitching about MMOD, I don't wanna even mention Cinematic Mod xddd
[5:53:01] <@akuda_bar> You'll just introduce jank into the game tbh
[5:53:02] <%KnivesEve> woolie will figure it ou
[5:53:02] <+YabbaTroll> ewvery one wins
[5:53:02] <+Pyroclase> I could explain the differences in depth if you'd like somewhre
[5:53:02] <+Kiaayo> there's no mmod for the episodes so you'll have to go back either way, might as well pull the bandaid
[5:53:02] <trianglehat> mmod ruins pacing with the extra guns
[5:53:03] <+Grayhammatter> woolie will figure it out
[5:53:04] <+gustavozxd> just don't play it
[5:53:05] <HitchhikingThrough> YEAH
[5:53:08] <%MaddyCaddy> It's kinda like the Deus Ex mod that makes it better but is different from the intended design
[5:53:08] <jackelzxaa> no, cinematic mod is twin snakes
[5:53:08] <HitchhikingThrough> YEAHH 100%
[5:53:09] <%generalve> yes
[5:53:09] <Lieutenant_America> Oh hell no
[5:53:10] <%Irridium> kind of yeah
[5:53:10] <Owlboy7> @WoolieVersus ive played vanilla and mmod multiple times and the only difference is mmod add cool animations and effects
[5:53:11] <%MaddyCaddy> It's just different
[5:53:11] <%Gruhunchously> NO
[5:53:11] <%ChoculaUltra> I would actually pay to see Woolie go through vanilla ravenholm
[5:53:11] <%Javaa01> A little bit, but not quite as offensive
[5:53:11] <+Deko_> play the ps3 version PogChamp
[5:53:12] <jackelzxaa> mmod is re1make
[5:53:13] <%generalve> YES
[5:53:13] <+theKingRamses> no
[5:53:13] <Visorak6> no
[5:53:14] <RunningNGunning> Not its not twin snakes
[5:53:15] <%Balkespower> NO
[5:53:17] <%Gruhunchously> Very much no
[5:53:19] <+Pyroclase> @Kiaayo there absolutely is MMOD for the epsides
[5:53:20] <major_gnuisance> Twin Snakes breaks level design
[5:53:21] <%aceleapc> MMOD is for repeat playthroughs
[5:53:22] <Daba_mk2> no
[5:53:22] <Lieutenant_America> Cinematic Mod is Twin Snakes
[5:53:22] <%BNPhone> MMOD changes the gameplay and adds weapons which is not good for a first run through
[5:53:22] <@akuda_bar> Like if Black Mesa was jank MMOD will just add more jank
[5:53:22] <+gustavozxd> just skip it and play alyx LUL
[5:53:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @JacexDowozWideo
[5:53:24] <%Irridium> same idea
[5:53:25] <DatAsuna> I wish
[5:53:25] <%GraceTBM> @Kiaayo Yes there's mmod for the episodes, but there's no HL2 Update for the episodes
[5:53:26] <%jiggy_snipe> those are two different games
[5:53:27] <VJdarkworld> if ur willing to fiddle with mods, mmod is worth it.
[5:53:31] <jackelzxaa> MMOD is RE1MAKE and Cinematic Mod is Twin Snakes
[5:53:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Cinimatic mod is Twinsnakes and can be used with MMod
[5:53:41] <%derap41> Not like Woolie will repeat playthrough it
[5:53:45] <vanderbolt777> Hello Gordan
[5:53:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> You only have to download the game
[5:53:46] <HitchhikingThrough> FROM CHAT? NEVER!
[5:53:52] <+Pyroclase> You can't go wrong with any choice
[5:53:52] <@Solidus_113> I'll do the research
[5:53:54] <%GraceTBM> Cinematic Mod has been pulled down by the author
[5:53:55] <+Buzzkill983> Geth requires Consensus
[5:53:56] <%Gruhunchously> You expect consesnus from chat?
[5:53:57] <+Pyroclase> Honestly, they're all great
[5:53:58] <+Grayhammatter> ONE CHAT
[5:54:00] <EDFscout> IM ONE GUUY
[5:54:01] <%Javaa01> WE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS
[5:54:02] <HitchhikingThrough> [ALL FOR ONE]
[5:54:02] <%Tuna_Can_0> I am one guy :)
[5:54:02] <%Balkespower> Play HL2 Update if you want better Visuas and bug fixes while maintaiing Vanilla HL2
[5:54:02] <+Freeborg1997> Just look up a comparison
[5:54:03] <jackelzxaa> nothing about mmod is a worse experience it's all gravy
[5:54:04] <+gustavozxd> I googled cinematic mode, what the fuck did they do to alyx
[5:54:06] <Daba_mk2> Chat is just one guy
[5:54:09] <+Deko_> WE ARE MANY
[5:54:10] <VJdarkworld> we are the galungaaaa
[5:54:10] <jackelzxaa> theres nothing to maintain
[5:54:11] <%MaddyCaddy> jermaOneguy jermaOneguy jermaOneguy
[5:54:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> All else fails Reshade!
[5:54:12] <@akuda_bar> we are guy
[5:54:12] <%lotharrio> The chat lacks consensus! We must murder each other until there is a single voice!
[5:54:13] <%jiggy_snipe> damn the clones are fighting each othe
[5:54:13] <PsychedelicSnake> Play both versions as a test and see what you want, but take into account the intended experience vs the modded
[5:54:14] <%Balkespower> *Visuals
[5:54:14] <%EdenOfLove> YOU ARE BUT ONE
[5:54:15] <Lieutenant_America> Chat does not intentionally infiltrate
[5:54:15] <%KnivesEve> everyone 1 has become as 1
[5:54:16] <%Gruhunchously> The geth are achieving consensus
[5:54:16] <ironwardog> just do a twitter poll
[5:54:16] <RunningNGunning> We are all united against one another
[5:54:17] <%derap41> @Javaa01 I'm not
[5:54:18] <jackelzxaa> mmod is just the kind of thing VALVE would update the game with
[5:54:18] <%ChoculaUltra> the one guy instrumentality chat.
[5:54:18] <vanderbolt777> We are Gordan
[5:54:18] <EDFscout> WE ARE GUY
[5:54:19] <+EternalJedi> INFINITY GUYS
[5:54:20] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus go rogue and play it on the 360
[5:54:21] <jazzygrooves> ONE OF US
[5:54:22] <Saffry_Ruzin> Legion would be fucked if he wanted to play HL2
[5:54:24] <AppleBerryKitty> i realy dont see much diff looking at the videos, I say just play normally.
[5:54:27] <Drchandragupta> @gustavozxd CMOD is actually undefendable lmao
[5:54:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> I AM SPARTACUS
[5:54:28] <+EldritchBee> Do you want to just launch the game or do you want to fiddle about with mods for an hour before you start
[5:54:30] <jeffthesequel> MMOD just improves the shooting.
[5:54:34] <Melchior_the_Wise> Play it on OG Xbox
[5:54:39] <terrasonny1> Cinematic adds a lot, its LIKE a remake itself, but do not add the models.
[5:54:40] <jackelzxaa> just turn everything in mmod on it'll be fine
[5:54:42] <%MaddyCaddy> Any is fine, tbh
[5:54:43] <%GraceTBM> @gustavozxd There's nearly a dozen versions of Alyx based off of pornstars and they are all ugly models that disregard the original design
[5:54:44] <mikash91> mmod is a mod, unlike Black Mesa which was recognized by Valve
[5:54:44] <%derap41> OK everyone tie one hand around you back and break out the knives
[5:54:44] <jackelzxaa> mmod also has better effects
[5:54:45] <%Gruhunchously> I wonder if being in chat is approximate to the experience of being a geth
[5:54:46] <Lieutenant_America> I just want him to use HL2 Update. It just makes the lighting better
[5:54:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:54:54] <HitchhikingThrough> yeah worry about it later, it matters a lot less than half life vs black mesa
[5:54:55] <jackelzxaa> mmod has black mesa features
[5:54:55] <+CaptainJax> Play the Xbox Huge version for maximum authenticity
[5:54:56] <DisposableAgent6362> MMOD just enhances gunplay, visuals (effects), audio and adds few cut weapons. It's not some detailed change like Cinematic Mod lol
[5:54:57] <%Tuna_Can_0> Any is good to be honest, just glad you're interested in it
[5:55:02] <Project205> Hey Woolie, any plans to stream sthe Strive Beta?
[5:55:03] <VJdarkworld> nothings lost with mmod really, just you gotta be willing to mess with settings
[5:55:03] <jackelzxaa> the hit effects in mmod are the same as in black mesa
[5:55:03] <%lotharrio> I guess it has to do with bug shooting a bunch of mods and seeing if any of them work.
[5:55:05] <Hegelundra> @WoolieVersus HL2 update mod is basically vanilla with better graphics
[5:55:06] <@akuda_bar> Let's put it this way: MMOD was only 5th place for mod of the year in the year it was released. So not even the best mod.
[5:55:14] <Incrodon> @Gruhunchously Mass effect but the Geth Primes say Pogchamp
[5:55:14] <JacexDowozWideo> MMOD MAKES AR2 A BELT FED MACHINE GUN it's ridiculous
[5:55:20] <shamuzu> lets just say that the differnce is smaller than hl1 versus black mesa
[5:55:23] <+PunJ0hn> get up and stretch! take a break yall
[5:55:28] <%Tuna_Can_0> @akuda_bar what was best mod PogChamp
[5:55:30] <jackelzxaa> mmod went through alot of updates
[5:55:35] <%RioGascar> Mmod would also have you doing lots of tweaking graphics wise and shit
[5:55:36] <Lieutenant_America> @JacexDowozWideo But what about the AR3?
[5:55:37] <HitchhikingThrough> hooooo
[5:55:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie, what yall playing for GITFG tomorrow?
[5:55:39] <Drchandragupta> @WoolieVersus did you know there's a version of HL2 for japanese arcades that had bike pedals for movements and a lightgun
[5:55:40] <%GraceTBM> @JacexDowozWideo what are you talking about? it does no such thing
[5:55:42] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[5:55:43] <RunningNGunning> @This_is_Marco Gordon thong mod Kappa
[5:55:44] <%MaddyCaddy> Based
[5:55:44] <+Zeiss_Schreiber> You do it
[5:55:46] <HitchhikingThrough> NICE JOB MAN <3
[5:55:49] <Hegelundra> @WoolieVersus HL2 Update mod is kinda like Dark Souls remastered in upgrade amount
[5:55:51] <major_gnuisance> Whatever you choose, let me set you up with a gyro aiming config for the DualShock 4. There IS life beyond The Cube, Woolieeee!
[5:55:52] <%chiluzza> When we getting that 5 hour podcast tho
[5:55:53] <jackelzxaa> cinematic mod has fully modeled vulva though
[5:55:53] <%Haarute> content <3
[5:55:53] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You'll probably have a good experience either way. The different versions of HL2 are minor compared to Half Life and Black Mesa.
[5:55:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> 5 hours to beat half of Xen, lol

[6:01:36] <%lotharrio> DokaPJ-party.
[6:01:47] <+Pyroclase> Xen is a team of modders leanring to make their own video game. I 1000% understand the rough spots.
[6:01:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:01:57] <+kewlmyc> To play some videogames that suck ass
[6:01:58] <+EternalJedi> limesD Samurai Jack?
[6:01:58] <@akuda_bar> back to the past, samurai jack?
[6:02:02] <Lieutenant_America> To play the shitty games that suck ass
[6:02:08] <%jiggy_snipe> it was a little long
[6:02:12] <+EternalJedi> akuda_bar eyyyy limesYay
[6:02:15] <Lieutenant_America> HE'D RATHER PLAY
[6:02:27] <whitemage4life> @woolieversus Will you have a kirby let's play to heal Blood Sport division
[6:02:28] <VJdarkworld> apparently black mesa still gonna be updated with overhauls in the future
[6:02:28] <%jiggy_snipe> Pat Kappa
[6:02:50] <jorniev> I STILL HAVE A PLAY 3
[6:02:54] <+Pyroclase> I once knew a guy who insisted that the Lord of the Rings books were lame because they were just "generic fantasy with the same old orcs and elves"
[6:02:58] <%generalve> unless your aris Kappa
[6:02:59] <%derap41> Still haven't played Red dead
[6:03:08] <%derap41> can't fucking catch u
[6:03:09] <%derap41> o
[6:03:11] <%derap41> p
[6:03:17] <%jiggy_snipe> this is the reason that Seinfield sucks KappaHD
[6:03:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> I still haven't played God of War NotLikeThis
[6:03:23] <detectiveluca> SOCIAL DISTANCING
[6:03:27] <%eanscrale> That's tragic, Demon's souls was a revelation
[6:03:29] <DatAsuna> it depends
[6:03:35] <serpenttucker> "Bro darling is way better then NGE
[6:03:35] <DatAsuna> I can enjoy old games that hold up
[6:03:39] <jorniev> PLAY FALLOUT
[6:03:41] <%RioGascar> That being said. Some old games dont hold up
[6:03:43] <DatAsuna> I can't enjoy old games that were cool for their tech
[6:03:44] <%derap41> Its like trying to get into One Piece all over again
[6:03:47] <%aceleapc> I know someone who says shit like FF6 was good for it's time and is just bad now
[6:03:48] <jorniev> NEW VEGAS
[6:03:50] <whitemage4life> We should recommend a group Kirby let's play to avoid break up from Blood Sport
[6:03:54] <alrobot2014> @serpenttucker that's so wrong its almost heretical
[6:03:55] <%derap41> Unreal was amazing
[6:03:57] <%Javaa01> On consoles
[6:04:00] <@Solidus_113> Pre-Max Payne
[6:04:05] <DatAsuna> tech demo games age far worse than others
[6:04:10] <whitemage4life> FF IX is best
[6:04:14] <theredfox930000> I would say pre resident evil 4
[6:04:17] <Lieutenant_America> Max Payne 1 is still super fucking fun, and I started that series with 3.
[6:04:20] <%derap41> Unreal 2004 was the shit
[6:04:23] <serpenttucker> @alrobot2014 That's my point
[6:04:29] <%lotharrio> @aceleapc That person is wrong and should feel bad.
[6:04:34] <%derap41> DLC is optional
[6:04:47] <Visorak6> The Episodes are short
[6:04:50] <Lieutenant_America> No they don't
[6:04:53] <@Solidus_113> Ep1 and Ep2 are important. OF and BS are skippable
[6:04:53] <unit24> blue shift and opposing force are not important
[6:04:57] <Drchandragupta> Blue Shift and Opfor are not necessary for story, Episode 1 and 2 are
[6:04:58] <Lieutenant_America> Not Blue Shift and Opposing Force
[6:04:59] <+EldritchBee> opforce and BS are not needed
[6:05:01] <+Pyroclase> opposing force kinda HAS aged poorly, to be honest
[6:05:04] <%BNPhone> Blue Shift and OPFOR are not importasnt // they are in canon limbo @WoolieVersus
[6:05:08] <Railgun5> Blueshift and Opposing Forces are 100% optional
[6:05:08] <%Gruhunchously> Blue Shift adn Opposing Force are side stories mostly
[6:05:09] <+EldritchBee> Ep1 and Ep2 are literally the second half of HL2
[6:05:14] <jorniev> part 1 and 2 are half li 2.2 and 2.5
[6:05:14] <%derap41> "Liberated"
[6:05:17] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Half Life 2: Episode 1 starts a second after the ending of Half Life 2
[6:05:22] <@akuda_bar> brain baby
[6:05:24] <Lieutenant_America> And that's just the first game
[6:05:35] <%derap41> Top Men
[6:05:36] <Lieutenant_America> DUDE THAT'D BE SICK
[6:05:43] <CookieDoughFK> Acord is Gman
[6:05:50] <aeonicvector> Nah, accord's an Intern there, cant look them in the eyes
[6:05:50] <VJdarkworld> now thats a game theory PogChamp
[6:05:52] <jorniev> 4th dimensional beings
[6:05:52] <unit24> why are people so focused on getting him to play MMOD
[6:05:54] <%generalve> hahahaha
[6:05:58] <@Solidus_113> I'm literally downloading all 3 versions of HL2 right now
[6:06:02] <Lieutenant_America> Time for a donate war
[6:06:03] <unit24> Like I don't understand
[6:06:03] <%generalve> VANILLA
[6:06:03] <%BNPhone> because they are very wrong @unit24
[6:06:04] <whitemage4life> It is harder for us to imagine the end of Capitalism than the end of the world
[6:06:04] <+Pyroclase> MMOD is fine, but be sure to disable the saturation filter
[6:06:05] <DisposableAgent6362> Yay!
[6:06:07] <%jiggy_snipe> quick tweet at Woolie
[6:06:09] <alrobot2014> blessed Solidus
[6:06:09] <%Gruhunchously> And so it begins
[6:06:10] <+Pyroclase> it makes the game look totally different
[6:06:17] <shamuzu> fun fact: the final boss of HL1 is based on gabe newells son who was a baby at the time
[6:06:20] <unit24> YES
[6:06:21] <DatAsuna> YEYEYEY
[6:06:21] <Zayasu> DO IT
[6:06:22] <EDFscout> LUL
[6:06:22] <Lieutenant_America> YO
[6:06:22] <+Buzzkill983> Sweet, never saw MMOD, so its new again
[6:06:24] <alrobot2014> that's how i first played HL22
[6:06:25] <%Balkespower> HL2 Update is fine enough as it is @WoolieVersus
[6:06:25] <%BNPhone> DO THAT
[6:06:26] <%afronooch> Do it
[6:06:26] <%derap41> Just piss in the cereal for all of us
[6:06:27] <jorniev> just do whatever woolie people will scream at you either way
[6:06:29] <+Pyroclase> oh god the xbox version runs at like 20fps

[6:06:34] <%jiggy_snipe> DO THAT
[6:06:35] <%Irridium> DO IT
[6:06:35] <%Balkespower> HL2 on XBOX
[6:06:36] <unit24> 360 VERSION GO
[6:06:36] <%Prevot> always one guy
[6:06:37] <%Gruhunchously> Take a third option
[6:06:37] <@Solidus_113> Orange Box has it all
[6:06:38] <%Javaa01> Woolie, you wouldn't survive the loading times
[6:06:41] <%lotharrio> Save this clip, Minh.
[6:06:42] <Lieutenant_America> YOOOOOO
[6:06:43] <Visorak6> Dont its a funny gag but you will HATE the 360 version
[6:06:44] <+queenghidora> 360
[6:06:44] <Agent_Sampson> DO IT YOU COWARD Kappa
[6:06:45] <%KingOfTheGeats> that would be an interesting experience
[6:06:46] <%BNPhone> 360 version aint even that bad and they got the cool weapon wheel
[6:06:48] <%RioGascar> Orange box IS HOW I PLAYED HALF LIFE 2
[6:06:48] <Daba_mk2> damn
[6:06:48] <%Gruhunchously> What is this blasphemy
[6:06:50] <jorniev> OG XBOX HAS HALF LIFW 2
[6:06:50] <unit24> 360 version is actually fine
[6:06:51] <%prime_name> Where is your 360?
[6:06:52] <EDFscout> NO
[6:06:52] <%Javaa01> The Orange Box console versions have ass loading times
[6:06:55] <%Tuna_Can_0> PogChamp
[6:06:55] <DatAsuna> everyone does
[6:06:56] <Lieutenant_America> I actually first played Half Life on the Orange Box on 360.
[6:06:57] <%RioGascar> THAT WAS MY INTRODUCTION
[6:06:57] <%aceleapc> I genuinely think if you think HL2 plays bad and isn't fun anymore, then you just don't like Half Life and are just lying about liking it
[6:06:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> DansGame
[6:06:58] <%derap41> Wait TF2 was on console?!?
[6:07:01] <Zayasu> LUL
[6:07:03] <Lieutenant_America> THAT would be nostalgia for me
[6:07:06] <%BNPhone> yes @derap41
[6:07:06] <%Balkespower> OH JESUS
[6:07:10] <%generalve> orange box has better aim assist
[6:07:10] <%mitchteck> Do it
[6:07:12] <CookieDoughFK> Reggie don't disrespect the cube!

[6:07:16] <Agent_Sampson> @derap41 Yup, Orange Box
[6:07:16] <Visorak6> BAD
[6:07:16] <%BNPhone> Not bad actually
[6:07:17] <@Solidus_113> HL2, Ep1+2, Portal 1, TF2
[6:07:18] <%MaddyCaddy> It's alright
[6:07:18] <alrobot2014> everyone and their mother had the orange box slipped into their ownership at some point or other
[6:07:18] <+YabbaTroll> its dope
[6:07:18] <EDFscout> no
[6:07:19] <%Irridium> Oh it's fine
[6:07:20] <@Solidus_113> It's alright
[6:07:20] <+Pyroclase> It's one of the worst ports ever made
[6:07:20] <%Javaa01> IT'S ENDLESS TRASH
[6:07:21] <Jack8274> It's alright
[6:07:21] <unit24> @WoolieVersus if you thought black mesa played fine, you don't need MMOD
[6:07:21] <+PunJ0hn> tf2 on console is realllly really bad
[6:07:22] <%derap41> @xx123manxx How in the fuck nugget was that playable
[6:07:23] <+sputnix> good port
[6:07:24] <%eanscrale> Yeah the orange box was on 360 and ps3

[6:09:09] <%Gruhunchously> That's what, three iconic games all in one?
[6:09:11] <%generalve> UHIH MAGENF
[6:09:18] <Zayasu> does it have aim assist?
[6:09:18] <%Balkespower> if you want better visuals and bugfixes then HL2 Update is good enough. No need for MMOD that's for replays.
[6:09:20] <jackelzxaa> x360 controller shooting
[6:09:22] <%derap41> Absolutely horrifying
[6:09:22] <jorniev> PLAY IT ON XBOX CLASIC

[6:09:25] <Daba_mk2> oh man
[6:09:26] <%Balkespower> LA BOITE ORANGE!
[6:09:27] <jackelzxaa> why do people keep saying its for replays
[6:09:31] <%generalve> make sure you play it on the one
[6:09:31] <jackelzxaa> it doesnt ruin the base game at all
[6:09:33] <%RioGascar> The orange box was one of the best collections ever
[6:09:36] <jackelzxaa> its just a more fun first playthrough
[6:09:40] <%BNPhone> WRONG
[6:09:41] <%RioGascar> like insane
[6:09:44] <jorniev> BYE BYE
[6:09:45] <jackelzxaa> i would reccomend mmod forever for first timers

[6:10:00] <whitemage4life> Reggie looks like a star wars character
[6:10:00] <%aceleapc> If you think Black Mesa plays well then you'll be fine with HL2 vanilla or HL2 Update
[6:10:01] <jackelzxaa> i would reccomend black mesa over hl1 and never playing blue shift or opforce
[6:10:02] <%Gruhunchously> Clap
[6:10:03] <VJdarkworld> LOOOL

[6:10:15] <Drchandragupta> (don't actually)
[6:10:16] <DisposableAgent6362> @jackelzxaa Unfortunately nostalgic freaks here don't agree...
[6:10:18] <%generalve> Woolie Vince fired a shit load of staff
[6:10:22] <jackelzxaa> mmod is just all of the effects and updates from black mesa in hl2
[6:10:25] <gunsrlove> BlessRNG

[6:11:49] <%BNPhone> cock and... ball
[6:11:51] <Namillus> Oh boy I can't wait to hear you guys elaborate on what you were talking about in the Get Into Fighting Podcast with the new mechanics
[6:11:53] <%aceleapc> It's not like I'm looking back at it with nostalgia goggles. I'm actively still playing it @jackelzxaa
[6:11:55] <%Irridium> play some CBT
[6:12:04] <Namillus> Because hearing it is one thing but a mechanical demonstration is essential
[6:12:10] <%BNPhone> literally played HL2 a week ago
[6:12:18] <Lieutenant_America> HL2 is fine either way, I just like unlimited sprint, view roll and new toys
[6:12:23] <@Solidus_113> It's alright, but not great
[6:12:34] <alrobot2014> the hud has tramp stamps?
[6:12:34] <+Pyroclase> FULLY MODELLED CERVIX
[6:12:39] <jackelzxaa> @aceleapc i just this month played vanilla and then immediately did a full mmod run and it was so much more enjoyable
[6:12:41] <+Pyroclase> wait we're talking about cinematic mod right
[6:12:41] <townzzzzz> so bad
[6:12:45] <%nothuzad> risk is slightly more readable
[6:12:52] <jackelzxaa> i actually would uninstall vanilla at this point if it wasn't part of getting mmod and update working
[6:13:03] <%Prevot> new gud, same as the old hud
