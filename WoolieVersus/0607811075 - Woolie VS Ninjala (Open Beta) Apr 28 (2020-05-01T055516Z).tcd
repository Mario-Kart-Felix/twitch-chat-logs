[0:18:26] <+bluedude153> Is there multiplayer in this build or will it be all training
[0:18:36] <YakumoYomi> The animated short was better than I was expecting.
[0:18:39] <BackwardCap> Their voices are deep because they're all adults transformed into kids by the gum.
[0:18:42] <SomersaultJustice> JUST A BOX
[0:18:52] <+DaSkeeters> Why do his lips look so red it looks like a popo
[0:18:54] <+SuperKirby24> Oh god how do you sync the camera
[0:19:00] <klonoakirb> i just tuned in and i was expecting naruto, what did i miss?
[0:19:01] <+Qsmash_> are they all adults or just some of them?
[0:19:04] <arkv01> just jump right in woolie, start wiling
[0:19:05] <fairore> @arkv01 hes a legal shotacon
[0:19:12] <C4m3r0n0409> But if. youre transformed into a kid you should have a kid voice
[0:19:14] <illegal_characters> their voices are deep because they're actually 3000 year old chinese myth dragons
[0:19:15] <+gutlesscoward> what do you mean, @klonoakirb? this is naruto
[0:19:20] <T_Sasquatch> @backwardcap by that logic their tracheas and lung size would be different
[0:19:24] <+Grayhammatter> YAAA

[0:19:41] <Xenstroke> oh cool LB is quick dash
[0:19:42] <+DaSkeeters> Storm 5 beta looking good
[0:19:43] <+Hoshidan> They're all adults who are turned into kids due to some "unforseen" side effects of the Ninja Gym.

[0:40:20] <crossing_mao> @ggbhtg Good discipline
[0:40:22] <$arcielardor> two bars
[0:40:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> UNIQUE
[0:40:27] <Junkles> because there's 8 different controller configurations
[0:40:28] <%ggbhtg> ooooh noooo back to the LAB AGAIN
[0:40:29] <eggsamillion> It's because of the use of joycons
[0:40:30] <skewerstar> Oh, didn't know GungHo worked on this!
[0:40:30] <DMatts142> its so synch your controller
[0:40:32] <laguerrilha> Make so "press any button"
[0:40:33] <Metrome91> Game combat feels too slow.
[0:40:33] <DMatts142> to*
[0:40:33] <+Grayhammatter> they've got another session later tonight
[0:40:34] <+Dr_DangerPhD> They probably do that so you don't use one joycon
[0:40:39] <+OddityOn> At least I have faith in the customization though they feel good
[0:40:40] <%Sparkseid> locked out
[0:40:40] <%ggbhtg> not again! back to the LAG AGAIN
[0:40:47] <+xGreenflame> It's a Splatoon thing and this is a Splatoon
[0:40:48] <Aracon_> good beta guys LUL
[0:40:50] <C4m3r0n0409> believe it
[0:40:52] <Saltmeisterr> it made sense in splatoon cuz u need both zr and zl to play the game
[0:40:55] <TopTierHarley> it's not about the 2nd session tonight it's about this first session not happening
[0:40:55] <Metrome91> They gotta speed up the combat and reduce hit stun.
[0:40:59] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GROSS?
[0:41:04] <%ggbhtg> We messed up back to the LAB AGAIN
[0:41:05] <laguerrilha> you use more fingers
[0:41:08] <+SuperKirby24> share ninjas chat LUL
[0:41:09] <%Rhinoprotoss> Some boomer complaints
[0:41:09] <+louiswho> the plus button on joycons are so damn tiny
[0:41:10] <%BisoromiBear> SRK to start the game
[0:41:12] <laguerrilha> more fingers more effort
[0:41:12] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> if i got it in my pocket it presses the start button
[0:41:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get rekt
[0:41:15] <+OddityOn> Lol
[0:41:15] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[0:41:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> UH OHHH BAXK TO LAB AGAIN
[0:41:16] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BLOWN UP
[0:41:16] <NiktenKing> Then why would you play a game that requires coordination
[0:41:17] <crossing_mao> Great beta gaes
[0:41:19] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GET FUCKED
[0:41:21] <irfan_> MINH GAMES
[0:41:21] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> plus button should be start
[0:41:22] <BlacSoul> Credit to Dmatts142, To synch Joycons
[0:41:22] <nepwar> make it the same. it is inconvenient to do two
[0:41:25] <+Psycosis> What about some Super Mario Maker 2?
[0:41:26] <Junkles> it's 100% because of joycons
[0:41:28] <rubbishbinge> this must be one of those first world problems
[0:41:28] <%Wool> it's to sync
[0:41:33] <MattDemers> hrm, Gung Ho reminds me of a terrible mobile developer
[0:41:40] <laguerrilha> any button is the best one
[0:41:45] <BackwardCap> Fail Safe
[0:41:46] <+deemellow> Salt Party Invisigun Heroes tho? ð
[0:41:48] <hilario_md> it's to recognize which joycons you're using
[0:41:48] <+louiswho> I have grips on my joycons and can barely touch the plus minus
[0:41:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> Its so they know what your controller configuration is
[0:41:56] <Junkles> wii u no have joycon
[0:41:56] <%fetrigon> @mattdemers is it MiHoYo?
[0:42:01] <Fabric_tester> It's to make sure the most important buttons work
[0:42:02] <eggsamillion> Oh yeah, some Wii games had you press A+B
[0:42:07] <Saltmeisterr> splatoon
[0:42:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> splatoon
[0:42:14] <Shishi1205> Yeah A+B was common in Wii
[0:42:14] <+SuperKirby24> iirc I think splatoon 1 and mk8
[0:42:17] <C4m3r0n0409> Wii sports had A+B
[0:42:23] <Junkles> hmmmm, Nintendo gonna tendo
[0:42:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> It was Mario kart 8 right?
[0:42:30] <skewerstar> GungHo worked on Teppen, dunno what else they worked on tho...
[0:42:33] <TheExaltedLT> @junkles this isn't Nintendo
[0:42:36] <darkocore> What is happening?
[0:42:38] <fairore> welp
[0:42:40] <laguerrilha> This is REALLY heavy "inspired" by Splatoon
[0:42:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> Didnt breath of the wild have you press something weird too?
[0:42:44] <%KnivesEve> do it harder
[0:42:46] <NiktenKing> Because your fingers aren't on the plus buttons when you hold a controller
[0:42:47] <TheExaltedLT> gungho created puzzles and dragons
[0:42:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:42:49] <+MetalPanic> A+B makes sense to ensure the casual base has their hands on the most important buttons
[0:42:50] <eggsamillion> @laguerrilha fr
[0:42:53] <%BisoromiBear> Minh is one guy
[0:42:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is a hill, isn't it?
[0:42:57] <Zayasu> villain
[0:42:57] <YakumoYomi> GungHo has Puzzle & Dragons
[0:43:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> There are good reasons to :)
[0:43:00] <%nothuzad> gungho also funded let it die V:
[0:43:02] <C4m3r0n0409> MINH LUL
[0:43:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:43:05] <fairore> @fuqboislim nah it was just start
[0:43:06] <%ggbhtg> DO IT FOR JAPANESE HONOR
[0:43:06] <laguerrilha> energy and time Minh
[0:43:10] <arkv01> EARLY SALT PARTTY
[0:43:11] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh is a troll
[0:43:12] <TheExaltedLT> they also own the the people who made no more heros
[0:43:14] <DMatts142> 2 frames?! Speedrunners in shambles? Kappa?
[0:43:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> PRESS L1 + B WHILE HOLDING R3
[0:43:14] <SomersaultJustice> it's just a launcher command Kappa
[0:43:16] <%Wool> It's the Share Button talk all over again
[0:43:21] <nepwar> i don't understand when is there a situation i accidentally hit start and its a huge problem
[0:43:22] <Prevot> "complexity"
[0:43:22] <thewizardpenguin1> :/
[0:43:22] <Fabric_tester> Check your shoot and aim buttons
[0:43:24] <C4m3r0n0409> MINH
[0:43:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fairore ah alright
[0:43:25] <+Hoshidan> GungHo also had Ragnarok Online according to my research
[0:43:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[0:43:35] <justfourprimes> The triggers are way easier to press by accident
[0:43:41] <lymund> The triggers feel nicer to press
[0:43:41] <laguerrilha> Acidental entering the menu??? how would that be a problem?
[0:43:43] <%ggbhtg> DO IT ONE WAY AND STICK TO IT, Japanese HONORRRR
[0:43:44] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> FACTS
[0:43:47] <Saltmeisterr> they are getting really heated over this LUL
[0:43:48] <Junkles> good point woolie
[0:43:48] <YakumoYomi> I put a lot of time into Ragnarok Odyssey Ace on PS3
[0:43:49] <+DizzmanLive> There is almost like a standard for controler configs so anything thats difference just feels gross
[0:43:49] <justfourprimes> no one is going to hit the plus by accident
[0:43:52] <%nothuzad> Hoshidan maybe in japan - but RO is Gravity
[0:43:53] <+Taglog7> Whadayah buyin?
[0:43:53] <@Solidus_113> https://twitter.com/playninjala/status/1255219172512063497 https://twitter.com/playninjala/status/1255219172512063497 https://twitter.com/playninjala/status/1255219172512063497
[0:43:54] <powerprotoman> it shouldnt be but people are stupid reggie, take for instance this argument
[0:43:55] <%Struggleful> Make people do a 4 hit combo to start fighting games
[0:43:55] <nepwar> Facts & Logic LUL
[0:43:55] <NickHatesSnow> LUL
[0:43:56] <%jiggy_snipe> exactly Woolie
[0:43:57] <justfourprimes> the plus is a way stiffer press
[0:43:57] <Prevot> BOTH shoulder buttons at the same time?
[0:43:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> It's just two buttons man
[0:44:01] <justfourprimes> heres the thing
[0:44:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> flat ass
[0:44:04] <+TheRisingPride> I mean before that, you gotta press Home to wake the console, then press the same button thrice
[0:44:08] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Petiole_
[0:44:08] <%nothuzad> YakumoYomi while certainly budget in some ways I had a bunch of fun with that game
[0:44:08] <+FridayStreamer> I thought pressing both buttons on the joycon was so you know they're both for player 1?
[0:44:08] <C4m3r0n0409> THIS ARGUMENT IS DONE
[0:44:09] <%ggbhtg> DO IT ONE WAY AND STICK TO IT, Japanese HONORRR
[0:44:10] <justfourprimes> you gain and loose nothing either way
[0:44:12] <+xGreenflame> John Con
[0:44:13] <NiktenKing> Press the ANY button, Woolie
[0:44:13] <BlackOrchidKI> I don't really care either way. It starts the game.

[0:44:30] <+Ondartyr> So you want to press the + that is way more annoying to press than the two buttons you have your index fingers close to, anyway?

[0:45:37] <+Hawk_Rush> let em know minh Kappa
[0:45:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> He said the thing!
[0:45:38] <+megamanx74> It's a choice that they made might be on a personal level but we can really call the shots because we did not make the game. Overall, we need to ask the source if we really want the answer.
[0:45:39] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie is wrong
[0:45:40] <T_Sasquatch> YOU'RE WRONG WOOLIE

[0:45:59] <DMatts142> I still prefer a select button, but I like having a screenshot/clip button
[0:46:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> Share Button is based. I love it
[0:46:02] <CrimsonSilver4> TRhey're doing maintenance
[0:46:02] <Prevot> now woolie is rehashing the argument

[0:46:12] <Saltmeisterr> ok but how is the actual game?
[0:46:21] <+Hawk_Rush> LUL
[0:46:22] <arkv01> @SuperKirby24 bot this is going to leave a shit taste in a lot of potential players' mouths...

[1:00:11] <%Solidnick18> me either
[1:00:14] <rubbishbinge> An immense amount of progress was made in Berserk
[1:00:15] <%ChoculaUltra> its wild to think that to this day, Skull Knight hasn't been officially been named in the series
[1:00:16] <rubbishbinge> Said no one
[1:00:18] <laguerrilha> HxH is never going to be finished

[1:01:10] <Arek_1> What is this browser extension?
[1:01:12] <laguerrilha> Google indicated news spoiled me on Doom and FF7R
[1:01:23] <%heartlesshealer> Nier probably yeah
[1:01:30] <TigerClaws12> dmc?
[1:01:31] <%DatAsuna> peaking of nier, you still ain't finished!
[1:01:45] <%prime_name> That makes sense as the Liam LP was going on at the same time, yeah?
[1:01:45] <Shishi1205> Google news fucking spoils me sometimes of One piece manga spilers before the chapter is out
[1:01:48] <NiktenKing> Nier spoilers are like opening your eyes... easy to see (unless you are blind)
[1:01:51] <Shishi1205> Fucking news
[1:02:03] <%heartlesshealer> Nah, they got DMC early and kept Woolie clean of absolutely all spoilers that Capcom didn't release themselves
[1:02:04] <nepwar> that must have been hard being restricted from seeing 2b fat fucking ass
[1:02:30] <rubbishbinge> Get into GUNDUM?
[1:02:35] <%Visorak6> because publishers hate fun
[1:02:36] <laguerrilha> @Shishi1205 yeah, it spoiled me on how Kaido looks

[1:04:04] <bleugh> hitbox
[1:04:05] <InfiniteSwagbito> I was a controller guy most my life until I got this PC, and Mouse/keyboard felt super awkward. But I'm not weak so I got good and learned it.
[1:04:11] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:04:13] <TigerClaws12> Jesus LUL
[1:04:21] <C4m3r0n0409> Sounds like death
[1:04:24] <%xpakeo> also my wrists are big fucked, so using my stick pains me
[1:04:25] <rubbishbinge> Can't do stick u_u
[1:04:39] <skewerstar> I'd love to get into Skullgirls if I can stop getting bodied every time I go online... I'm really not good with Mahvel-like fighters. BibleThump
[1:04:43] <%optimasmaximas> WutFace
[1:04:44] <nepwar> does the hitbox differ from what theyre talking about
[1:04:45] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus You know I think the reason you only like controllers for games is cause for the longest time you only used keyboard and mouse for work. so now your brain assosiates keyboard with typing and not wasd controls.
[1:04:52] <@Solidus_113> PS Dpads are garbage
[1:04:59] <%optimasmaximas> xbox elite controller has a great d-pad
[1:05:01] <+EmperorWeeb> DS3/4 D-pad is objectively the best
[1:05:02] <arkv01> dualshocks 1 were NOT good
[1:05:02] <InfiniteSwagbito> garbage d-pad
[1:05:08] <TigerClaws12> Vita dpad is the goat tho
[1:05:09] <+deemellow> I love the ps4 dpad
[1:05:17] <whoisdisgrace> Ps vita has the best dpad
[1:05:18] <FromGoon2Goon> PS Vita d pad was one piece
[1:05:21] <+FridayStreamer> i like the sega genesis dpad
[1:05:21] <masterfire23> imagine playing fps games with a controller LUL ... oh wait
[1:05:26] <Arek_1> I've always heard that the Saturn dpad is where it's at.
[1:05:27] <+cvp5127> was woolie able to get in?

[1:13:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus HE'S THAT LAST BEAST
[1:14:01] <%Exiliator> He was Might, and he took it one step further, from M to N Kappa
[1:14:02] <Shishi1205> Because he goes night night
[1:14:02] <Picosunloaded> @WoolieVersus also he punches so hard he bends reality
[1:14:07] <ravenrooke> Morning Peacock, Afternoon Tiger, Night Guy
[1:14:07] <0rond> the morning peacock, afternoon tiger, night guy

[1:15:10] <nepwar> green naruto what a surprise
[1:15:13] <+SilverInferno3> Horikoshi loves Naruto
[1:15:13] <Shishi1205> Endevour vs nomu
[1:15:16] <%Visorak6> stolen powers can always be trumped by one honed and intimately understood one
[1:15:18] <+CarlosEoM> AFO vs OFA
[1:15:18] <+Grayhammatter> green naruto
[1:15:29] <arkv01> DER THING
[1:15:29] <NevikGamina> Do we though?
[1:15:30] <%WanderingSwordsman> Night Guy is to signify that he becomes the Beast
[1:15:31] <NevikGamina> LUL
[1:15:33] <dan_g_v> you mean green gon
[1:15:33] <+kyh9> Stealing super powers vs getting super powers given to you
[1:15:33] <blue6sub6remnant6> Are we talking manga spoilers or anime spoilers in MHA?
[1:15:34] <%ggbhtg> subete yooo
[1:15:42] <Shishi1205> Woolie only watches
[1:15:43] <+fingalights> the other green naruto

[1:15:46] <%ggbhtg> animw
[1:15:47] <+SilverInferno3> @blue6sub6remnant6 I mean probably just S3 of the anime
[1:15:49] <phatmac16> anime
[1:15:55] <@Solidus_113> support the official release
[1:15:55] <nepwar> @blue6sub6remnant6 neither. woolie hasn't caught up

[1:16:09] <rubbishbinge> buy the Blu-ray disc set
[1:16:10] <%ggbhtg> EVERYDAY I'M ANIME
[1:16:10] <NevikGamina> isnt a manga also an official release technically?
[1:16:11] <%GrassCannon> Woolie confirmed pleb taste
[1:16:11] <%Exiliator> or buy a shirt
[1:16:12] <BlacSoul> how far is 20 behind?
[1:16:12] <Shishi1205> You can read it first then rewatch it
[1:16:15] <Kira2993> you dont pay my sub Kappa
[1:16:15] <laguerrilha> But the live chat is so funny BibleThump
[1:16:16] <+SilverInferno3> But what about the abridged series ð¤
[1:16:17] <%ggbhtg> EVERYDAY I'M anime
[1:16:18] <NevikGamina> this analogy kinda falls apart
[1:16:18] <BlackOrchidKI> But muh chat reactions
[1:16:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @phatmac16
[1:16:20] <Shishi1205> Check the comments and laugh
[1:16:20] <+TheRisingPride> I read the LN and throw the anime on in the background when I'm doing other stuff
[1:16:21] <RajelSkoven> Has the salt bled into RL?
[1:16:21] <+Hawk_Rush> I can't wait TFS to do an abridged seriese Kappa
[1:16:25] <dan_g_v> manga cant even swim

[1:17:06] <legacyofsol> My favorite VO fact is the connection between Code Geass and Persona 4. Susaku voices Yosuke, Lelouche voices Adachi (which makes the final scenes more epic). Also in P4Arena, it's ironic that Yu's voice is taken over by Adachi.
[1:17:08] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh should try to play too

[1:39:19] <Saltmeisterr> also how does the character creator work?
[1:39:26] <%Wool> Twitter account said it's extended
[1:39:43] <Saltmeisterr> its it just preset characters or fully customizable?
[1:39:45] <laguerrilha> @Saltmeisterr preset characters, change color and clothes
[1:39:46] <Arblaster_> Is that girl holding a dildo?

[1:40:02] <Oxybe> @arblaster_ ribbed for her pleasure
[1:40:05] <Shishi1205> Timezone bs is high in America. Here in Europe we have mostly one timezone (except the british/Irish)
[1:40:35] <Shishi1205> (For most oficial things)
[1:40:36] <laguerrilha> can you pet that cat/dog?
[1:40:36] <%Wool> it's Settings
[1:40:46] <%Wool> The scroll is Settings
[1:41:10] <%Wool> why is it clicked off by default lmao
[1:42:10] <black_pariah> why is there no text for menu options, what modern game company leaves that out
[1:42:20] <$silentblast93> wait would weapons have durability?
[1:42:32] <%blastazoid00> What does "money off" mean?
[1:42:36] <Shishi1205> Remember Mario maker 2 didn't have that
[1:42:37] <blue6sub6remnant6> Is this the 'murrica stage, given that its called EAGLE CITY?
[1:42:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> It's a nalt thing
[1:42:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> @black_pariah the same one that sets a beta only for an hour LUL\
[1:42:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> LUL *

[1:43:17] <+tealplague> LUL
[1:43:25] <+OddityOn> I think it's cause auto target is enabled

[1:44:05] <Shishi1205> Nope
[1:44:07] <Shishi1205> Lol
[1:44:13] <laguerrilha> that needs to be changed
[1:44:14] <kesler031> how long since ninjala started?
[1:44:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> The controllers I play my switch on dont have gyroscope in em. NotLikeThis
[1:44:23] <+Grayhammatter> WOW
[1:44:26] <laguerrilha> holy shit tha supper
[1:44:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> @kesler031 like 3pm EST
[1:44:59] <lymund> Reverse daruma
[1:45:01] <InfiniteSwagbito> this may as well be a reskin of strikers, but that's just gungho meeting a bare minimum as usual
[1:45:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> gungho made Shinobi strikers too?
[1:45:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> i really wanna like this game but i can't in there is so much going on :/
[1:45:38] <Shishi1205> Wow garbage settings
[1:45:48] <kesler031> so an hour and a half? i take it was mostly character customizing... ill just check the vod later for the first part.
[1:45:49] <$silentblast93> im digging the music though
[1:46:16] <laguerrilha> there is a button left, they should make it the change target
[1:46:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:21] <TigerClaws12> control customization in a console game? It really is 2020
[1:46:26] <BackwardCap> Looks like the entire ost is already in, hope someone dumps it.
[1:46:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nintendo games and garbage settings. name a more iconic duo
[1:46:30] <%ggbhtg> Dmc, Kingdom Hearts....
[1:46:38] <nepwar> it looks like the game is meant to be played without a hard lock @WoolieVersus
[1:46:40] <%Struggleful> @kesler031 Couldn't play the game for most of that time
[1:46:41] <%Chichen> @WoolieVersus I think the lock on system is set up this way to balance PVP
[1:46:43] <%ggbhtg> games with sense...
[1:46:46] <kilexeyXd> anyone getting error #G-0--001 ?
[1:46:49] <%lazuli_alter> @FuqBoiSlim this isn't Nintendo, this is GungHo
[1:46:50] <laguerrilha> cycling between multiple enemies attacking you at the same time is important
[1:46:51] <TigerClaws12> this is pretty much Dissidia
[1:46:57] <%ChoculaUltra> @kesler031 well the game's servers went down for about 15- 20 minutes and before that was Woolie and Minh just trying to get into the game for another 15 minutes.
[1:47:00] <%xpakeo> i am @kilexeyXd

[1:49:07] <Solid_as_a_brock> Server times message is back.
[1:49:10] <Enderou> this that new splatoon?
[1:49:11] <gustavozxd> not a good time for this with everyone in quarantine
[1:49:16] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus dont quit training
[1:49:21] <NiktenKing> You can make gum missiles, gatling, net traps...
[1:49:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> so its confirmed the yoyo is the best weapon in the game right?
[1:49:30] <BlacSoul> DO NOT QUIT ITS BACK DOWN
[1:49:30] <NiktenKing> Hopefully more weapons at launch
[1:49:41] <%lazuli_alter> @WoolieVersus Don't quit training, servers are back down
[1:49:42] <+OddityOn> DO NOT QUIT
[1:49:43] <%Struggleful> Never leaving training is how I play fighting games
[1:49:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> JESUS
[1:49:52] <$silentblast93> so this beta was only for 1 fucking hour?
[1:49:52] <+SuperKirby24> get quarrantined in training mode LUL
[1:49:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'm sure you get more weapons by leveling up like in splatoon
[1:49:59] <+OddityOn> EARLY TRAINING ARC
[1:50:03] <%ChoculaUltra> whoa wait, there's fighting games that aren't played in the lab?! heresy.
[1:50:04] <gustavozxd> <- training mode only player
[1:50:16] <+Grayhammatter> that's an insane special
[1:50:39] <+OddityOn> Oh that's awesome
[1:50:49] <InfiniteSwagbito> stage design definitely stronger than strikers
[1:50:50] <+DoctorAvens> i wonder how big the team sizes are
[1:50:55] <+TheRisingPride> How does it control when wallrunning? Well?
[1:51:00] <gustavozxd> this really is the shinobi strikers of videogames
[1:51:04] <+Infernal_Dalek> Perform the Chaos Dunk
[1:51:12] <jazzygrooves> the goddess herself PogChamp
[1:51:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think team matches are 5v5
[1:51:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> so, is this good?
[1:51:17] <nepwar> goddess please sit on my face
[1:51:21] <InfiniteSwagbito> You can't reach the statue of liberty, she's using AT Fields
[1:51:25] <+TheRisingPride> Yes
[1:51:29] <gustavozxd> did woolie even play a match yet?
[1:51:31] <+TheRisingPride> You get 1 back
[1:51:31] <laguerrilha> Wish more anime would make the Statue of Liberty a mech. Like Space Dandy
[1:51:38] <Kira2993> isn't it too big for 8 players?
[1:51:38] <NevikGamina> the Apples increases your max gum it looks like
[1:51:42] <+xGreenflame> @WoolieVersus Hold the stick back and press attack
[1:51:51] <Saltmeisterr> gyro aiming is actually tight
[1:51:52] <%lazuli_alter> Red Drones increase your max S-Energy capacity @WoolieVersus
[1:52:06] <+Taglog7> I'm wall Walkin Ova here!
[1:52:15] <flaucho1> I can't enter the game
[1:52:21] <Bigfatnoodle> Is there a button for resetting the camera when using gyro? I couldn't find it before the server shut down again
[1:52:25] <+OddityOn> Our GMOD prop hunt shit
[1:52:32] <laguerrilha> this seems a better better suited for 16-20 playres
[1:52:40] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder if its the y button

[1:53:03] <flaucho1> @bigfatnoodle the button of the left stick resets the camera
[1:53:04] <+TheRisingPride> Can you tell the AI to do it?
[1:53:11] <Bigfatnoodle> thanks @anobanano1

[1:53:23] <pouchilepoichiche> I donât want play :(
[1:53:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> server devs getting worked more than naughty dog devs BibleThump pray for em
[1:53:45] <pouchilepoichiche> I have the switch just the game as bugged rip :(
[1:53:46] <+OddityOn> LMAO why is Prop Hunt in my Melee Splatoon
[1:53:49] <+xGreenflame> There's directional stick inputs for attacks
[1:53:52] <gekizenbu> is this woolie's ninja way
[1:53:56] <gustavozxd> I don't think this is anything like splatoon
[1:54:00] <+Taglog7> LUL BibleThump
[1:54:11] <laguerrilha> its probably better for team fight mode
[1:54:12] <+shry7> honey, it's 3pm est, time for your daily server down
[1:54:12] <NekoZen> really good for a Capture The Flag mode
[1:54:16] <NiktenKing> The skill cards have benefits that are more suited towards transforming, but they aren't really unlockable/upgradeable in the beta
[1:54:18] <NekoZen> hide and camp the flag
[1:54:18] <gustavozxd> other than the art style I guess
[1:54:23] <+SuperKirby24> need to unga bunga to win Kappa
[1:54:26] <BackwardCap> Hiding gives time to recover health without being ganked
[1:54:30] <@Solidus_113> Prop Hunt...
[1:54:32] <TopTierHarley> don't forget to continue to dash by swinging your weapon in the air
[1:54:45] <shinmaster47> neccalii
[1:54:46] <+Dreadlord134> Hide to regain life
[1:54:52] <lymund> Its probably for ambush
[1:54:56] <nepwar> works for 1v1
[1:55:32] <NiktenKing> 4v4
[1:55:35] <TopTierHarley> don't forget you get your double jump back after a wall cling @WoolieVersus
[1:55:37] <%Wool> still down
[1:55:37] <Iwashi94> maybe they'll have a prop hunt mode? lol
[1:55:43] <lightgianma> they twitted again. VoHiYo

[1:56:08] <laguerrilha> i wonder if they will make bigger lobbys. this map is too big for less than 16-20 players

[1:56:27] <+xGreenflame> Left/Right are also different
[1:56:29] <+Grayhammatter> that's the RPS
[1:56:29] <NiktenKing> It also acts as a zone tool
[1:56:30] <%lazuli_alter> YOO CHAOS DUNK
[1:56:31] <Iwashi94> and the dunk leaves the ball as a projectile
[1:56:35] <NiktenKing> the ball will stay in place
[1:56:35] <gustavozxd> I don't think the map is too big
[1:56:40] <%Weeewer> is woolie enjoying this chat?
[1:56:43] <NevikGamina> Here i gooooo
[1:56:45] <+SuperKirby24> @Saltmeisterr yeahh I get serious KIU vibes from the combat in this game
[1:56:47] <%fetrigon> THIS GAME IS SICK
[1:56:51] <gustavozxd> this is a game where you're supposed to hide, with more than 10 players that's pretty much impossible
[1:57:01] <TopTierHarley> @WoolieVersus hang on the side of a building and transform
[1:57:09] <+Taglog7> Who da pretty lady on the poster? Kreygasm

[1:59:06] <gustavozxd> this game seems to have some cool mechanics
[1:59:10] <lymund> You could use the camouflage around the red bots and ambush
[1:59:16] <NiktenKing> Zone tool for the drones
[1:59:17] <+SuperKirby24> So its pretty much yoyona from hyperfight Kappa

[2:02:17] <%Weeewer> Oh thats a fun block mechanic
[2:02:24] <kingdomfan0> how do you play while severs are down?
[2:02:35] <gustavozxd> damn you can set up and bring it back and hit the guy that's strong
[2:02:42] <+Grayhammatter> he's in training
[2:02:59] <gustavozxd> BONK
[2:03:03] <kingdomfan0> yeah but is won't even let me in
[2:03:05] <%Wool> bruh that hammer does so much damage
[2:03:07] <LittleWulfie> Isn't there a specific attack against blocks?
[2:03:15] <stormydaysz> no it pops on you if you get hit by the guard break
[2:03:31] <+GaldinoTT> If he changes weapon, can he enter training again?
[2:03:31] <LittleWulfie> oh yes guard break
[2:03:32] <jazzygrooves> @kingdomfan0 he was in training before servers went down, it'll kick him out if he leaves training now
[2:03:47] <kingdomfan0> ahh I see
[2:04:14] <Shishi1205> So the dunk would be a guard attack?
[2:04:19] <madgerofl> Why do you still have access when the beta is closed ?
[2:04:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> wow they really put time into this
[2:04:20] <%lazuli_alter> weapon break?
[2:04:22] <%lazuli_alter> yoo
[2:04:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> this has meta
[2:04:40] <gustavozxd> tactical nuke incoming
[2:04:42] <Ekana_Stone> Is there 1v1 ?

[2:04:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> gomu gomu no nuke
[2:04:52] <kirattar> How are you playing the game
[2:05:05] <%lazuli_alter> they got into training mode before servers went down again
[2:05:09] <nepwar> doesnt look like break does dmg but it fucks your weapon
[2:05:11] <stormydaysz> can break get into rps?
[2:05:11] <@Solidus_113> use break attack after the 3rd hit of a regular combo, or when you knock them away
[2:05:11] <+DrTribal> how is woolie playing ninjala rn
[2:05:23] <laguerrilha> yeah, move speed need to be tunned up a little
[2:05:24] <%Exiliator> Your characters resolve is being tested in the lower left corner LUL
[2:05:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> hes in training mode. if he leaves he'll get kicked out
[2:05:42] <GiuStorm> ninjala does not work on my switch yet XD
[2:05:46] <+trippersigs22> i wish the run speed was higher thats my only complaint
[2:05:56] <Joy_v0> @legacy0117 The caracther i choose i was really fast and more if you use the Y special + the R button
[2:06:03] <nepwar> what is the thing around the character icon on the left
[2:06:14] <+SuperKirby24> @trippersigs22 yea, it feels like you arent moving fast enough when you run
[2:06:15] <Ghostbody> As you said, your fun is secondary
[2:06:17] <+NYCrownlessKing> woolie needs a BIGG weapon
[2:06:20] <@Solidus_113> Ninja sense to see where enemies are
[2:06:36] <gustavozxd> SIZE
[2:06:37] <+BeetleJuicePapi> thats incorrect
[2:06:43] <%Exiliator> Size matters

[2:07:58] <+TheRisingPride> Big weapon, size go up
[2:08:13] <+NYCrownlessKing> I assume a larger hitbox
[2:08:17] <NekoZen> you start small
[2:08:17] <laguerrilha> You start with the small
[2:08:24] <+TheRisingPride> Because you have to build up to big

[2:12:45] <%Exiliator> Would you trust a guy who learned to do surgery "in the field", probably on a battlefield or something. Or a guy who has never cut up someone, but hes read a lot of books
[2:12:45] <NevikGamina> I wanna die inside
[2:12:47] <@Solidus_113> No doctor knows everything
[2:12:50] <arkv01> minhs likes to play operation
[2:12:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> When's the last time Minh read a non-manga book?
[2:12:57] <%ggbhtg> BIG semantics going on
[2:12:57] <NevikGamina> this is the 6 paths of Minh
[2:13:00] <+Quinn_Carter> Minh, I feel like you're trying to overexplain something very simple
[2:13:02] <+blkalucard1> learned it on the streets
[2:13:03] <scrublord009> ... this is just shinobi strikers LUL
[2:13:06] <baron_b0nes> Minh cannot commit read.
[2:13:10] <%killfrost11> minh off on his crazy shit isnt he
[2:13:13] <misunderstood_poo> at least practice your handwriting
[2:13:15] <%jiggy_snipe> so this is why Minh won't play tutorials Kappa
[2:13:17] <%ggbhtg> HUGE semantics abound
[2:13:18] <+Merhabi> A Diploma is a badge of 'GOOD ENOUGH'
[2:13:19] <+teh_rawk> how did woolie get in?
[2:13:20] <+Sum_White_Guy> huh I coulda swore I was followed long before this
[2:13:22] <blue6sub6remnant6> You know medicine isn't s completely solved field, right Minh? Doctor go to conferences and learn about new ideas in medicine.
[2:13:23] <gustavozxd> Woolie is trying to exist
[2:13:27] <arkv01> underground surgeon minh
[2:13:27] <+trippersigs22> Minhs right it doesnt matter HOW you learn something as long as you learned it
[2:13:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> Reggie, you can learn that EVEN WITHOUT the tutorial
[2:13:50] <laguerrilha> then you wouldnt know how to parry, so no practice
[2:13:52] <%killfrost11> killfrost11 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2:13:56] <+thecmash> im not gonna trust a doctor who learned surgery by playing trauma team on the wii
[2:13:57] <+armor_kuma> BOOKS TELL YOU
[2:13:57] <Reizie_Etherealm> You can see others doing it, and then you can experiment to find out
[2:13:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Minh taking the game grumps approach to gaming.

[2:14:10] <+Quinn_Carter> Neither side is explaining their points very well NotLikeThis
[2:14:14] <+Merhabi> But Minh why would you waste the time to figure it out independently when they have it WRITTEN DOWN
[2:14:17] <+Gutsandlove> THATS HE'S NINJA WAY REGGIE
[2:14:19] <laguerrilha> Jesus Minh
[2:14:19] <+SuperKirby24> how are we getting salty on a non-dokapon stream Kappa
[2:14:19] <BAM4LFE> dokapon returns

[2:14:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie has made the right decision.

[2:14:39] <%lazuli_alter> THE GHOST OF DOKAPON HAS ARRIVED
[2:14:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ay what the FUCK is going on?
[2:14:40] <Morning_Asakura> i dont like this chat
[2:14:41] <+thecmash> the doctor analogy is what brought us here
[2:14:42] <blue6sub6remnant6> Minh is !motivated
[2:14:43] <%jK00215> i thought dokapon was tomorrow....
[2:14:44] <NevikGamina> this Ninjala LP is something else huh LUL
[2:14:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> I left for like t minutes
[2:14:48] <%Visorak6> Woolie wants this on the vod lmao
[2:14:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'm with Minh on this one, Reggie is stomping and snuffing out Minh's methods for NOTHING
[2:14:49] <+liquidzr0> look at Woolie getting this free content
[2:14:49] <lymund> These ur boys woolie?
[2:14:50] <%picante_papi> Ain't nobody learn nothing reading BOOKS
[2:14:51] <+Merhabi> Hey Woolie hows the gum game
[2:14:51] <Mrthefro> Woolie moderate please
[2:14:53] <%Wool> Woolie's just silent during all of this lmao
[2:14:54] <+l3l3onsai> anyone having trouble logging in?
[2:14:56] <scrublord009> It's setting in on shinobi strikers recolor
[2:14:57] <%Jetzord> The real salt party was Ninjala all along
[2:14:58] <khetrak> @WoolieVersus hey woolie, is the game fun ?
[2:14:59] <+armor_kuma> You can shortcut experience by READING SHIT before it happens
[2:15:01] <Morning_Asakura> can we cool it pls NotLikeThis
[2:15:01] <%xpakeo> i hope this isnt in the ninjala anime video lol
[2:15:03] <+PandaBanchou> only a fool would repeat history instead from learning from it NotLikeThis
[2:15:04] <scrublord009> WOOLIE DON'T GIVE A SHIT LUL
[2:15:05] <Shishi1205> Woolie is looking away
[2:15:09] <%DatAsuna> Woolie escalate plz
[2:15:12] <%jiggy_snipe> that's my ninja way
[2:15:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @xpakeo I absolutely hope it is.
[2:15:13] <jazzygrooves> Like, i feel like reading how to do something and then trying to do it and nail it down is better than just blindly going through something LUL
[2:15:15] <%afronooch> minus a tactile learner, the gang discusses
[2:15:16] <%ZetsuKoko> Minh's logic is basically how you learn anything BUT medical shit
[2:15:19] <+TheRisingPride> I will Raw level 3 on wakeup every single time until I get punished for it, THEN I'll try something else
[2:15:21] <+VantomPayne> cant wait for the video upload
[2:15:21] <lymund> HahaPoint
[2:15:26] <laguerrilha> Escalate into gun violence
[2:15:27] <Morning_Asakura> @jazzygrooves this
[2:15:28] <zenith0111> LEARN THROUGH EXPERIENCE
[2:15:30] <Shishi1205> Too late for that now, the patient is dead
[2:15:30] <+thecmash> didnt minh literally get 8th place by using this mehod
[2:15:30] <%jiggy_snipe> dattebayo
[2:15:33] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus Woolie: How could this happen to meeee, I made my mistakes!
[2:15:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> Chat are the servers working yet?
[2:15:38] <%Chichen> wooliePOYO
[2:15:39] <restingbones> So do all attacks home in?
[2:15:41] <NevikGamina> My head hurts
[2:15:41] <+Taglog7> The life of a streamer. Invite friends, so you don't have to talk.
[2:15:42] <NevikGamina> LUL
[2:15:43] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[2:15:46] <Tropicalhazard> Minh wants to play like a gorilla go unga my brother
[2:15:49] <Morning_Asakura> lol
[2:15:57] <%Exiliator> If you pick up a brand new fighting game, and are doing vs in 10 minutes. Would you rather play a few games against the AI blind, or only read through the tutorial?
[2:16:01] <%ggbhtg> this is the part where someone mentions a game mechanic with a weird button combination
[2:16:05] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh learns by doing or through practice and apparently does get anything from reading or theory
[2:16:07] <Morning_Asakura> same
[2:16:09] <Raldavar> Guys I think this is how Shippudan starts. Minh is going to join Dr. Chi Maru and Woolie has to go get him back
[2:16:13] <Morning_Asakura> its not fun
[2:16:14] <arkv01> pound that mistakes pussy Kreygasm
[2:16:15] <AceAGod> Same
[2:16:19] <xdeathknightx> woolie needs to know who the boss character is first
[2:16:21] <zenith0111> So you hate starting games?
[2:16:21] <crimsonsaens> People telling you systems is spoilers though
[2:16:22] <NiktenKing> Play chess without knowing the rules
[2:16:26] <laguerrilha> i hate not knowing not being able to use all avaible
[2:16:33] <%ggbhtg> Max is like this too, Kenny Steve and Simmons aren't with fighting game
[2:16:34] <blue6sub6remnant6> Minh sez: "I can't understand why genocide is bad, I haven't had any bad experiences with it yet." NotLikeThis
[2:16:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> @exiliator I'd rather go to the lab just to learn the character's moves then a few matches against the cpu
[2:16:53] <laguerrilha> @ggbhtg Max tests it first, then tutorial
[2:16:54] <%Struggleful> I like getting bad about forgetting about game systems
[2:16:56] <T_Sasquatch> You do you
[2:16:59] <%Struggleful> mad*
[2:17:01] <$StaceMcGate> how's the game going so far
[2:17:01] <iggeh> @blue6sub6remnant6 You're really not helping with dumb statements like that
[2:17:07] <+trippersigs22> @Blue6subs thats an absurd take away
[2:17:09] <mrblack499> i think woolie would be better at nioh 2 then pat
[2:17:13] <blue6sub6remnant6> Fair.
[2:17:15] <%lazuli_alter> @blue6sub6remnant6 this is a real reach
[2:17:17] <%jiggy_snipe> testing then tutorial is cool
[2:17:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Let's be honest, Minh is just going to grind the beginner zone until he's lvl 99.
[2:17:20] <+armor_kuma> "Hey I've made this mistake before, let me tell you so you can avoid it" Minh-"Nah"
[2:17:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> @blue6sub6remnant6 huh???
[2:17:28] <nepwar> im imagining someone going to organize sports with no knowledge whatsoever. learn by exp is pratical but you need those fundamentals.
[2:17:33] <%ggbhtg> SEMANTICS activated
[2:17:41] <laguerrilha> No, more quality time
[2:17:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> chat's full of bruh moments today
[2:17:42] <restingbones> same thing Reggie
[2:17:45] <nepwar> thats the same thing
[2:17:46] <laguerrilha> Quality> time
[2:17:47] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> That's the same thing Reggie lol
[2:17:52] <Shishi1205> yeah
[2:18:06] <+Taglog7> KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
[2:18:15] <Morning_Asakura> i like knowledge
[2:18:20] <stormydaysz> woolie and reggie want to learn , minh wants to button mash
[2:18:24] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> So you ignore it LUL
[2:18:25] <%xpakeo> someones gonna randomly click on the stream and will just be in awe at this conversation
[2:18:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'd rather learn the system first. so I can at least have an idea of what I'm doing wrong.
[2:18:30] <NevikGamina> but why aren't you thinking about ti though minh LUL
[2:18:31] <scrublord009> By the logic. MIHN WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE?????
[2:18:31] <arkv01> minha gonna die on this no books hill
[2:18:32] <zenith0111> Learning through habit > Learning through reading
[2:18:35] <Reizie_Etherealm> If you don't apply it, it totally goes away
[2:18:44] <+NoobieSnake> Minh is a professional troll, lol
[2:18:45] <%ggbhtg> there are 2 paths. just choose the path you prefer. that's all @woolieversus
[2:18:53] <%lazuli_alter> I can't wait to rewatch this on youtube LUL
[2:18:55] <laguerrilha> Sounds like ADHD
[2:18:55] <%Exiliator> @FuqBoiSlim Yeah me too, which is what I mean. If I just read the manual, Ill have more trouble doing it, then if im shown it directly, and told to replicate.
[2:18:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> Going into a fighting game blind without knowing ANY of the systems and losing just make me feel stupid
[2:18:57] <Shishi1205> But its a combo, learn into practice
[2:18:58] <rubbishbinge> best to use both
[2:18:59] <%jiggy_snipe> @zenith0111 clearly but you need to a base to build upon
[2:19:01] <scrublord009> Good Teachers LUL
[2:19:06] <+thecmash> but wait by doing the tutorial dont you literally learn by doing the moves/techniques listed
[2:19:10] <%Wool> Good Teachers Get One
[2:19:14] <NevikGamina> this is the 6 paths of Minh Kappa
[2:19:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> like something is being left out
[2:19:16] <zenith0111> They both go hand in hand dummies ;P
[2:19:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Isn't not learning the system the whole reason why the Three Houses LP videos the way they were?
[2:19:19] <+trippersigs22> @legacy0117 no it doesnt its COMPLETELY prefrence
[2:19:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> I know for a fact there are more than 2 paths, in fact there are six.
[2:19:25] <Shishi1205> Its like doing the lab practical before reading the protocol
[2:19:28] <ManOfReason> woolie and reggie dont even disagree, they just prefer to read before learning through experience
[2:19:32] <@Solidus_113> Minh the heated gamer
[2:19:32] <laguerrilha> Its just that the "i dont read" example was not good
[2:19:36] <scrublord009> Shinobi Strikers /END
[2:19:37] <Morning_Asakura> why are we still talking about this
[2:19:38] <@Moobot> Enough with the emojis @gustavozxd
[2:19:43] <%Wool> Minh's about to use the heated gamer word
[2:19:48] <%ggbhtg> Chat, KETCHUP OR MUSTARD ONLY PICK ONE
[2:19:49] <arkv01> minh needs that gamer pass ASAP
[2:19:53] <%fetrigon> Minh you're always wrong
[2:19:55] <nepwar> it is scary when it was compared to medical field
[2:19:55] <scrublord009> Mihn about to drop the gamer word Kappa
[2:19:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is this going to end up on the pop off report?
[2:19:58] <+armor_kuma> Cause you said doctors should learn by fucking up
[2:19:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> KETCHUP ALL DAY
[2:19:58] <Morning_Asakura> heated gamer moment
[2:19:59] <Shishi1205> Mustard

[2:20:06] <MJgee13> This is still playable?
[2:20:06] <+thecmash> using the doctor analogy led us here
[2:20:07] <+Dhrall> It's scary when you use a DOCTOR as an example
[2:20:08] <%Jetzord> Ketchup till I die
[2:20:10] <+tealplague> GAMER WORD INCOMING
[2:20:13] <+trippersigs22> Reggie it depends on the individual though
[2:20:15] <+Grayhammatter> money: ON
[2:20:15] <zenith0111> SO HOW ABOUT THAT NINJA GUM?!
[2:20:17] <%ggbhtg> DOES YOUR DOCTOR LIKE KETCHUP OR MUSTARD ONLY ONE or die! @woolieversus
[2:20:19] <gustavozxd> so anyway ninjala is a videogame I think?
[2:20:19] <%xpakeo> this next session of dokapon is gonna be scary lol
[2:20:21] <NevikGamina> yeah its Scary when its a Doctor minh LUL
[2:20:26] <rubbishbinge> Please don't learn to drive by trial and error

[2:20:38] <+Dhrall> That's literally the worst possible example besides like, nuke missile operator
[2:20:40] <lymund> But what if both doe?
[2:20:40] <nepwar> don't do that pls
[2:20:43] <$StaceMcGate> I just got here, is the server having issues? Is Woolie having fun?
[2:20:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont want a doctor who read only half the textbook to go digging inside my chest lmao
[2:20:59] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Servers been down
[2:21:03] <%ggbhtg> podcast material go up
[2:21:06] <rubbishbinge> or actually no maybe im wrong
[2:21:25] <+tuchpi> @FuqBoiSlim LUL
[2:21:25] <zenith0111> @rubbishbinge Both learning methods are kinda married to one another
[2:21:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I'll learn from my mistakes" Man the mistakes are gonna affect ME
[2:21:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:21:29] <rubbishbinge> yeah
[2:21:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Electrician, also a job you don't want to learn through trial and error.
[2:21:42] <rubbishbinge> trial and error in controlled environment
[2:21:49] <%jiggy_snipe> i wouldnt put someone on the street immediately
[2:21:50] <+thecmash> work with a full set of tools
[2:21:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> I think each method works in a case by case scenario
[2:21:55] <%DatAsuna> The important thing in fighting games is it isn't JUST trial and error when the "error" is another person trying to make you err
[2:21:56] <%jiggy_snipe> i learned the basics in the backyard
[2:22:12] <zenith0111> But we aren't playing a fighting game ResidentSleeper
[2:22:22] <%ggbhtg> if we're now just talking about video games.....I played Tekken incorrectly for YEARS @woolieversus because I nev-
[2:22:24] <gustavozxd> trial and error deadly rave, no guide on what button to press
[2:22:27] <laguerrilha> Extended trial and error is a bigger waste of time. i agree with mini trials between learning to solidify the content
[2:22:33] <%ggbhtg> @zenith0111 aaand there it is
[2:22:39] <stormydaysz> ideally you use every method of learning , but we are just talking about video games right now
[2:22:43] <NevikGamina> you need a mix of both
[2:22:46] <NevikGamina> at the end of the day
[2:22:51] <Morning_Asakura> welp
[2:22:52] <nepwar> ye at the end of the day
[2:22:53] <zenith0111> @ggbhtg You know I'm right

[2:25:53] <zenith0111> @gl0vesup7 But I am enjoying it just acknowledging the pointless conversation like everyone else ResidentSleeper
[2:25:54] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[2:26:03] <%jiggy_snipe> Black Zetsu took it
[2:26:03] <Shishi1205> that happened

[2:26:06] <T_Sasquatch> Yea that was fucking rad tbh
[2:26:09] <andrei11dr> Oh ,so he finishes NUNS4 ?
[2:26:12] <rubbishbinge> Black Zetsu is on Obito
[2:26:14] <@Solidus_113> Minato's
[2:26:16] <+TheRisingPride> He didn't finish it
[2:26:16] <%optimasmaximas> @andrei11dr no
[2:26:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> HE ALREADY HAD THE NINETAILS
[2:26:18] <T_Sasquatch> Coolest thing Sakura ever did
[2:26:21] <nepwar> 1+9+half of 9 from 4th= not dead nalt
[2:26:23] <iggeh> Nine Tails is inside Black Zetu @WoolieVersus
[2:26:23] <Damie904> Woolie forgot Zetsu took it from Minato
[2:26:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ZETSU INTERCEPTED THE NINETAILS
[2:26:30] <nepwar> *1+8+half of 9th
[2:26:30] <andrei11dr> But he played it earlier?
[2:26:31] <Xenstroke> Zetsu
[2:26:34] <laguerrilha> they stopped after Night Guy
[2:26:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> He got the 9 Tails first when he blocked Minato. He then got the 1 and 8.
[2:26:35] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus black zetsu is attached to obito so when black zetsu took it obito had it
[2:26:35] <rubbishbinge> Black Zetsu
[2:26:36] <%jiggy_snipe> Black Zetsu took it and Zetsu is on Obito right now
[2:26:37] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:26:39] <gustavozxd> math hard
[2:26:42] <+TheRisingPride> The black Zetsu part of his body stole it before that part
[2:26:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YES
[2:26:43] <laguerrilha> yes
[2:26:45] <Shishi1205> thank you reggie
[2:26:47] <nepwar> oh yeah black zet

[2:26:53] <rubbishbinge> And then Obito got control back
[2:26:55] <%Wool> Black Zetsu was still attached to Obito
[2:26:57] <mrblack499> sakura is useless lol
[2:26:58] <nepwar> so what is X and how do we solve for it
[2:26:59] <C4m3r0n0409> OBITO HAS BLACK ZETSU
[2:26:59] <+TheRisingPride> yes
[2:27:02] <%jiggy_snipe> Zetsu and Obito are the same person essentially right now
[2:27:07] <nepwar> 1+8+x=9???
[2:27:07] <%Reverend_Roscoe> TO GIVE TO MADARA
[2:27:16] <+TheRisingPride> Black Zetsu was in control at first
[2:27:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Zetsu was in control no?
[2:27:20] <C4m3r0n0409> That was black zetsu
[2:27:23] <Morning_Asakura> no that was setsu
[2:27:23] <Shishi1205> Nah black zetsu absorved it
[2:27:25] <+PenGia> Zetsu was still in control then
[2:27:25] <laguerrilha> Obito still had the 9 tails, then he got the 8 and 1 tail as a plus
[2:27:27] <Sandro2584> NO
[2:27:29] <gustavozxd> zeus? oh zetsu
[2:27:30] <Morning_Asakura> zetsu*
[2:27:32] <nepwar> oh yeaaa
[2:27:33] <@Solidus_113> Black Zetsu took the 9 Tails, then Obito woke back up and tricked Madara
[2:27:33] <+wahoohee> Hey y'all a new Ninjala Reddit was made called /r/NinjalaSwitch It is rlly cool check it out
[2:27:36] <%jiggy_snipe> did he do anything with 1 and 8?
[2:27:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> But then Sakura carried the 2
[2:27:41] <laguerrilha> yeah
[2:27:42] <T_Sasquatch> watch the anime LMAO
[2:27:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YES
[2:27:47] <C4m3r0n0409> Yes

[2:28:15] <C4m3r0n0409> Yes
[2:28:16] <mrblack499> there are no sakura fans lol
[2:28:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> But then you add Might Guy to the mix, and Madara's chances of winning drastic go down
[2:28:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YES
[2:28:26] <+TheRisingPride> yes
[2:28:27] <C4m3r0n0409> Hes already dead

[2:29:00] <Gaona_> so he dead DEAD
[2:29:00] <@Solidus_113> You'll see it a bit more in the Guy fight, when Minato intercepted those black orbs @WoolieVersus

[2:29:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, is there a limit to the amount of times you can make someone into a zombie?

[2:29:55] <+PenGia> NINJA MAGIC
[2:29:58] <0rond> @WoolieVersus the progression is asakujaku(morning peacock) hiradora (day time tiger) sekizo (evening elephant) and finally night guy
[2:30:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> So why don't you just have a resurrection team on standby to immediately necro back someone as soon as their zombie goes?
[2:30:03] <Shishi1205> Minato sealed the half kyuby with the mask demon
[2:30:04] <Arblaster_> Obitos new design is very bad
[2:30:05] <+NYCrownlessKing> so he comes back and the power stays with the death god? @Bluydee
