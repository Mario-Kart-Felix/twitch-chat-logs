[0:22:40] <X2Eliah> becuase thye record as separate files
[0:22:53] <%A_German_spy> @Aldra_E It's necessary because they're uploading these to YouTube after the streams.
[0:22:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:22:55] <DSD24> Its weird how the PS5 hasn't been released yet
[0:23:00] <darkkittycatlovery> Hey does quitting out when you’re surrounded with enemies work in this remaster?
[0:23:08] <+Aldra_E> @A_German_spy makes sense, thanks

[0:24:34] <%lil_pudintater9> oh wow much better shield fir now
[0:24:36] <RyuuAoi> KEEP ROLLIN
[0:24:37] <CappuccinoGuil> No parry, though
[0:24:50] <%A_German_spy> @darkkittycatlovery To a limited extent. He's looking at a potential spellsword setup at the moment.
[0:24:53] <Josef_Stryker> Doesn't it also have really good stability?
[0:24:56] <MyNameIsRasus> no parry with the adjudicator i think
[0:24:57] <ronin19xx> Are we gonna go for a regen build?
[0:25:02] <CappuccinoGuil> @Josef_Stryker 90%
[0:25:04] <dodgy_dingo_> Health regen builds in des can get pretty nuts
[0:25:16] <%emperordread> practice on some 1-1 goons
[0:25:17] <%Javaa01> @ronin19xx For the time being at least, yes
[0:25:18] <darkkittycatlovery> Was hoping for Giantdad 😅

[0:26:40] <derap41> D E E P L O R E
[0:26:42] <darkkittycatlovery> Does Dark souls lore apply to real life at all Spy? 😅
[0:26:45] <%bPlusPlus> take a swing
[0:26:48] <darkkittycatlovery> *souls lore
[0:26:52] <ronin19xx> Nice lore
[0:26:54] <CappuccinoGuil> TIME FOR CRAB
[0:26:54] <+jiggy_snipe> good lore, thanks Spy
[0:26:57] <%tallik44123> fat ass demon booty lore
[0:26:59] <%A_German_spy> @darkkittycatlovery Maybe some of it karacoLOL
[0:27:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Gotta be a damn detective
[0:27:10] <+drinkmoxie> If he increases his equip load can he wear that shield while using a second shield that blocks 100% or are you only allowed to carry 1 shield in DES
[0:27:12] <%cvp5127> fist him
[0:27:23] <%bPlusPlus> my demon cheeks keep alerting the abyss hunters
[0:27:32] <%CreggaMonsta> omg thank you for that note spy
[0:27:35] <ronin19xx> Lore in demons isnt very in your face
[0:27:43] <derap41> Adv tech there
[0:27:45] <darkkittycatlovery> Hey if I asked for advice for where to go in Dark souls remastered would that be okay? I can’t find any videos that help where I am.
[0:27:45] <%A_German_spy> @CreggaMonsta spyServed
[0:27:50] <%CreggaMonsta> lol
[0:28:01] <%A_German_spy> @darkkittycatlovery Where are you?
[0:28:11] <derap41> Like the Ancient proverb goes "Drop Your Shield"
[0:28:11] <%asdief_> know what I mean sipsipBaby
[0:28:12] <%emperordread> Who's this "We" woolieSPICE
[0:28:14] <+Undenizen> SOME MORE THAN MOST, WOOLIE
[0:28:30] <CappuccinoGuil> L1 is the literal block button. You only block when you're about to be hit. That's the optimal block time
[0:28:36] <+ttvp> Parry animation actually gives you a second or so to walk closer before you activate the riposte
[0:28:40] <+CaptainTitforce> @darkkittycatlovery what's your problem?
[0:28:42] <darkkittycatlovery> Met Gwyn after defeating Orstien and smough and don’t know where to go from there.
[0:28:43] <X2Eliah> Did Woolie literally just go "well, we all need to learn to drop our shields"
[0:28:49] <DamnJP> wattup?

[0:28:57] <velgaduere> @X2Eliah the growth is true
[0:28:59] <%megaman_sentinel> katana maybe
[0:29:00] <%Javaa01> It was basically one and a half skeletons worth of souls
[0:29:06] <%Javaa01> So basically nothing in practice
[0:29:09] <abelincoln_catpuncher> aaaayyyyeee Reggie with the notes!!!
[0:29:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Uchi time? Or crescent falchion?
[0:29:17] <emeraldskrull> Reggie doin' homework?
[0:29:18] <ronin19xx> Nice
[0:29:18] <%Juriasu> Reggie is so diligent
[0:29:19] <%A_German_spy> @darkkittycatlovery You mean Gwynevere? You need to head to Firelink Shrine. Look for something new there which wasn't there before.
[0:29:21] <%Sparkseid> N O T E S
[0:29:24] <ronin19xx> Detailed notes
[0:29:27] <+CaptainTitforce> @darkkittycatlovery take the lordvessel that you got back to the big snake in firelink
[0:29:29] <derap41> Partial parry
[0:29:30] <velgaduere> partial parry
[0:29:31] <%krispen_wa> Partial parry
[0:29:31] <resloxxx> OH HE NOTICED
[0:29:32] <%Amaideus> That's a partial parry
[0:29:33] <+Undenizen> the parrying is *really* tight.
[0:29:37] <+CaptainTitforce> ah :D spy is too fast
[0:29:38] <%Javaa01> Partials exist
[0:29:40] <dundore77> didn't reggie mess up and landed on that one ledge so he lost his souls?
[0:29:41] <%Amaideus> If you do it slightly late that's what happens
[0:29:45] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus That's a Partial Parry. If you whiff a parry, you don't get stunlocked, but you do take some damage.
[0:29:46] <LunarRemix> Good eye Reggie.
[0:29:58] <%Javaa01> Yeah you ain't getting those souls back
[0:29:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:30:03] <%Amaideus> Tbh I often find that getting the partial is worse than just eating the hit
[0:30:05] <JetpackMcQuack> haha
[0:30:07] <%Amaideus> Costs more stamina
[0:30:16] <%Amaideus> At least in DS3
[0:30:17] <X2Eliah> OMG they cheating
[0:30:20] <%CreggaMonsta> is it bad I never rly paried in any of the souls games?
[0:30:23] <darkkittycatlovery> Okay one second
[0:30:24] <X2Eliah> big big cheats
[0:30:29] <derap41> That's a tough cookie
[0:30:31] <%Amaideus> His bloodstain had like 400 souls
[0:30:33] <%A_German_spy> @CreggaMonsta It's totally optional. You don't need to.
[0:30:33] <JetpackMcQuack> go get em
[0:30:36] <%CreggaMonsta> cool
[0:30:37] <+Undenizen> those are gone
[0:31:04] <%Juriasu> "No"
[0:31:33] <darkkittycatlovery> Thank you I’m just an idiot 😅
[0:31:48] <%Javaa01> But that demands you don't flinch on the first hit
[0:31:59] <%A_German_spy> @darkkittycatlovery Nah, these games just don't hand you your next objective up front most of the time.
[0:32:09] <ronin19xx> Stamina drain
[0:32:10] <%CreggaMonsta> whats OS. fighting game term stuff?
[0:32:14] <X2Eliah> .... can you two-hand a shield?
[0:32:14] <+zzNamttamzz> Still have the katana to check out
[0:32:22] <%Amaideus> You can
[0:32:23] <%A_German_spy> @X2Eliah If it's in your right hand, yes
[0:32:24] <%CreggaMonsta> o option select i just got it

[0:34:11] <darkkittycatlovery> He seems real important.
[0:34:13] <%A_German_spy> @darkkittycatlovery Talk to him. He'll tell you who he is.
[0:34:14] <+CaptainTitforce> @darkkittycatlovery you mean lore wise?

[0:36:23] <%tank7013> To be fair it's a lot easier to be "that lady" in a world where you can literally pray to the gods for healing with a talisman and your wounds start knitting themselves back together

[0:38:13] <%A_German_spy> @Ashenik1 Not one specifically, but in general, I like the "rival battles" best: Old King, Artorias, Gascoigne, etc. Those, and also the bosses with interesting and well-thought-out mechanics.

[0:42:21] <andre11dr> This is the DESERT area pretty much
[0:42:21] <%BestTeaMaker> not enough snow or rain to be montreal
[0:42:25] <X2Eliah> Sand. It's coarse and gets everywhere.
[0:42:25] <Oscarthemowerman> hasn't ever ben a proper desert in a souls game
[0:42:26] <velgaduere> @akuda_bar no, this place is more put-together
[0:42:28] <derap41> Reminds me of Assassins creed
[0:42:28] <+jiggy_snipe> Sun is out, very chill
[0:42:31] <CappuccinoGuil> @Double_Tap_That he's either the final boss or the NPC that shows up to help you in the fight, no in-between

[0:43:29] <velgaduere> LAVAL NATIVE
[0:43:35] <andre11dr> I think this is like the only you see sun in the game, besides the final place
[0:43:36] <%Lion_kun> The beauty of the game design in Demons is that every world provides a specific benefit, 1 is grass, 2 is ores, 3 is skeptic spice, 4 is souls and 5 is moss(and eventually ephemeral eyes)
[0:43:37] <X2Eliah> "Filthy man"? That's emaciated Woolie

[0:45:49] <ronin19xx> AWESOME BRANCHES
[0:45:54] <X2Eliah> Is that a translation problem?
[0:45:56] <Crashfan01> Sharp means life
[0:46:04] <derap41> emergency pierce weapon
[0:46:06] <BlackermanZX> sharp means strand
[0:46:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> we minecraft bois
[0:46:08] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Yeah. Hardstone and Sharpstone are both the standard upgrade path, which goes to +10. They're just used for different weapons.
[0:46:08] <%Lion_kun> We can't have sticky white stuff but we get sharpstone
[0:46:17] <X2Eliah> strandstone?
[0:46:22] <linSP> Remember sticky bows too
[0:46:23] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a pierce weapon, very good in this zone
[0:46:24] <derap41> Don't knock the Warpick its pretty good
[0:46:30] <andre11dr> Did he take the spear? Cus if he didn't this might take a while
[0:46:30] <%dreadedcthulhu> I love how the dark souls pickaxe has obscene str scalinf
[0:46:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the s in strand stands for sharpstone
[0:46:31] <MyNameIsRasus> "Diggin minecraft style"

[0:54:38] <+Deekman> HEAL
[0:54:38] <%ChoculaUltra> wow, a Kardinal Offishall reference in 2021. Now that's a deepcut LUL
[0:54:40] <derap41> Just need to be aware of it

[0:54:43] <+saltpiggu> fool
[0:54:52] <RyuuAoi> DROP SHIELD AND HEAL
[0:54:54] <X2Eliah> JUST SWAP BETWEEN THEM
[0:55:00] <derap41> Woolie with 10 Faith he can buy heal spell
[0:55:08] <notsoy> why block fire spells when you can dodge them
[0:55:13] <+Deekman> at that point 2 hand
[0:55:14] <X2Eliah> Well
[0:55:19] <+xx_killa_mila_xx> no shields, you scrublords
[0:55:22] <user_naim> Just do it
[0:55:22] <X2Eliah> you assume he "can" dodge 'em
[0:55:27] <+Deekman> may aswell 2 hand if he's gonna dodge anyway
[0:55:32] <hazeprojekt> just dodge not block
[0:55:34] <MyNameIsRasus> 2 hand is correct if you're not gonna block
[0:55:35] <Darren716> His sword probably blocks fire better than the adj
[0:55:40] <user_naim> No shield/rolling/parry run is the only way
[0:55:47] <CappuccinoGuil> If you want hard numbers, the ring regens 4 HP per second.

[1:02:29] <+0neReeler> pickaxe level
[1:02:43] <+Undenizen> Reggie, the answer is always yes.

[1:02:51] <PrideOfFiddles> @X2Eliah He beat the skellies in 4-1 fair & square, with his fists
[1:02:55] <Ashenik1> When you start from as a Borotarian you start with 88 levels

[1:03:02] <CappuccinoGuil> "something good" he says LUL

[1:03:39] <%tank7013> @X2Eliah Earned cheese is still cheese
[1:03:41] <+Undenizen> remember in oldschool shooters where you EXPLODE if you have to crouch your legs slightly?
[1:03:47] <%A_German_spy> @Deekman A Primeval Demon spawns down there

[1:17:16] <linSP> I guess item burden is so you don’t have infinite heals now
[1:17:16] <amritadyne> @saltpiggu not worthless at all, you can use it on a weapon that comes with an upgrade (like the crushing battle axe for example) and get a battle axe, do whatever you want with it. or you make a mistake when upgrading a weapon down the wrong path, revert.
[1:17:55] <Johannen> @dundore77 If they pick up something heavy it will be sent to storage automaticly and they will lose the ability to get it right then adn there

[1:24:38] <amritadyne> @Deekman crescent has a lower physical component than the base falchion, it's the magic
[1:24:49] <%tank7013> Also probably good to realize how strong your gear is so you don't horribly underestimate the rest of the zone

[1:25:29] <+Deekman> @Deekman a base level one sure, but to make a crescent you need to get it to a + then convert it
[1:25:38] <RyuuAoi> He almost ready to drop the shield
[1:25:43] <+Deekman> @Deekman +5 that is
[1:25:45] <andre11dr> I know also know that Penetrating Sword does a number on these guys because it has that trust attack

[1:26:46] <+AsinPersuasion> full moon grass tho
[1:26:50] <MyNameIsRasus> 500 damage in two hits

[1:35:41] <%astrofizzix> Quick tip: DON'T accidentally use firestorm in this room. That's what I did years ago in my first souls playthrough, and it didn't end well.
[1:35:43] <jorniev> do that
[1:36:00] <derap41> But Crescent Utchi
[1:36:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Crescent Uchi time?
[1:36:14] <+Axle13j> accidental firestorms are always fun lol
[1:36:26] <MyNameIsRasus> CRESCENT UCHI
[1:36:42] <ronin19xx> Crescent Uchi is a GUD idea
[1:36:52] <+BusterRepukken> the comment section on that podcast clip has gotten depressing
[1:36:57] <CappuccinoGuil> If he does Crescent Uchi, though, might as well pump up Magic
[1:36:58] <X2Eliah> Oh no
[1:37:00] <+FackinCrazy> Seriously throw away the melt stone or end up like me 10 years ago where you accidentally destroy your maxed out weapon before the last boss
[1:37:05] <%tank7013> That's nice. Kinda expected them to make you carry shit for Ed
[1:37:06] <X2Eliah> did the trumpies get to the vid?
[1:37:09] <+BusterRepukken> yes

[1:37:12] <BlackermanZX> a lot of trumpies
[1:37:12] <andre11dr> I never firestormed npcs ,but i did Gods Wrath Tomas once, so that was fun
[1:37:12] <derap41> Maybe he could do Enchanted Utchi instead
[1:37:20] <HamFamJam> u needed the materials on you in the original right?
[1:37:23] <X2Eliah> Well, on the upside, big engagement
[1:37:27] <derap41> Sharp Enchanced Unchi
[1:37:27] <X2Eliah> good for the algorithnm
[1:37:33] <dundore77> it ultimately comes down to do you want to grind if you decide to change later?
[1:37:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Wait, you can't make it Crescent?
[1:37:42] <dundore77> assuming its not max level things
[1:37:49] <+saltpiggu> go sharp uchi
[1:37:58] <amritadyne> @CappuccinoGuil upgrades are restricted to certain weapon levels
[1:38:05] <Equirah> damit i'm late
[1:38:07] <derap41> Woolie he has weapon enchanment
[1:38:13] <X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus It's OK just upgrade it, Woolie can grind the materials offscreen
[1:38:14] <CappuccinoGuil> @amritadyne I thought that was just for boss weapons
[1:38:24] <BlackermanZX> damn that shield looks cool
[1:38:28] <ronin19xx> Have a crescent and shard weapon
[1:38:31] <derap41> Its a old school Iron
[1:38:32] <amritadyne> @CappuccinoGuil nah, it's the same with normal weapons too
[1:38:33] <ronin19xx> Sharp
[1:38:46] <amritadyne> normal upgrade paths rather
[1:38:57] <dundore77> i miss the loading screen art. it hyped up people
[1:38:57] <%krispen_wa> IT'S THE BEST LOADING SCREEN
[1:39:03] <andre11dr> Now this thing can get fucking busted in pvp
[1:39:07] <Johannen> So if you gotten here first you would have gotten a weapon for 4-1...as if this is intented easy level
[1:39:12] <derap41> That's a clothing Iron
[1:39:26] <derap41> Sharp Uchi with magic enchanment
[1:39:40] <ronin19xx> Cant wait for THAT knuckle weapon
[1:39:43] <amritadyne> @Johannen it's not hard to get a decent piercing weapon for this area, it even gives you one (pickaxe) early on
[1:39:51] <%Lion_kun> We'll fuck the music and remove the best loading screen but fuck fixing the sixth archstone.
[1:39:54] <@Solidus_113> Souls Santa Spy will have gifts for Reggie off stream
[1:39:55] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can buy Moonshadestone Shards from Blige in 4-2, since Reggie already rescued him. You can go straight there now that you've beaten the Adjudicator.
[1:40:07] <derap41> 2-3 weapons at the most can be maxed
[1:40:11] <+BusterRepukken> yeah not really a fan of what they did to the music
[1:40:22] <BlackermanZX> i hope they change their mind and make the sixth archstone dlc
[1:40:24] <Dannzzyy> Wat spy said
[1:40:39] <MyNameIsRasus> it hits hard
[1:40:39] <+BusterRepukken> also the monster designs are kinda ehhhh
[1:40:40] <%A_German_spy> @Solidus_113 Nah, I'm not gonna ruin the experience for Reggie. This is his first time. Firsthand experience is crucial.
[1:40:47] <+PkSilent01> hey what did I mis
[1:40:50] <CappuccinoGuil> But he has 10 magic, it's really weak scaling LUL
[1:40:50] <+PkSilent01> miss^=*

[1:40:58] <Johannen> @amritadyne My point excatly, Stonefang is intended next level for begginers

[1:41:36] <linSP> +5 crescent is like a fully upgraded weapon right
[1:41:43] <andre11dr> So i still don't fully know if Reggie is actually going to use magic eventually or not
[1:41:46] <+FackinCrazy> For the love of god and all that is holy please destroy the melt stone... its one miss click from ruining your weapon
[1:41:47] <amritadyne> @linSP yes
[1:42:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Tearing Uchi sounds better than Sharp Uchi, then
[1:42:30] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr He hasn't decided that yet
[1:42:31] <amritadyne> demon's souls bleed builds LUL
[1:42:38] <%Pillagius> Sharpuchi?
[1:42:55] <ronin19xx> Des bleed is trash compared to Ds 3
[1:43:06] <BlackermanZX> i work alone BOI doodBait
[1:43:11] <andre11dr> Either way he should go sharp and buff with Light Weapon later when he gets there
[1:43:12] <amritadyne> every game after this has far better bleed
[1:43:13] <MyNameIsRasus> SEX JOKE
[1:43:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL

[1:43:39] <%blerrger19> Bleed isn't a tear off in Des, right?
[1:43:52] <%A_German_spy> @blerrger19 Right, it's just damage over time
[1:43:58] <amritadyne> @blerrger19 right, it's a miniscule DoT
[1:43:59] <%blerrger19> ew
[1:44:03] <andre11dr> Bleeding works like poison in DeS
[1:44:05] <+PkSilent01> sinkhole?
[1:44:16] <%blerrger19> Does it affect stamina at all?
[1:44:17] <derap41> Canyon ?

[1:44:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Man this LP makes me wanna play a new Souls Game, but Elden Ring is never
[1:44:30] <dundore77> is there a way you can get down here without turning the elevator on? like pumping health and just surviving the drop?
[1:44:31] <%A_German_spy> @blerrger19 Bleed doesn't, but poison and plague do
[1:44:32] <amritadyne> @blerrger19 nope, that's plague
[1:44:37] <andre11dr> I think it effects healing
[1:44:41] <%blerrger19> Ew, bleed is trash lool
[1:44:52] <%A_German_spy> @blerrger19 Er, Plague does for stamina, Poison and Plague both do for healing

[1:45:55] <Sunstalker> NEVER PUNISHED
[1:46:02] <andre11dr> You can do some scummy shit where you can stack Poison Plague and Bleed in pvp and they can't do anything at that point
[1:46:05] <amritadyne> rolling down the elevator is a gamer move
[1:46:19] <%tank7013> If this is Reggie on the elevator we're gonna have a GREAT time in the pit

[1:47:34] <dundore77> its not like someone dropped a full set of +5 armor for him
[1:47:34] <hazeprojekt> Reggie paid the iron price not the silver
[1:47:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> The armor has been baptized in blood
[1:47:44] <%tank7013> Many a durst was weathered to reach the state he's in

[1:48:57] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> NICE EZ
[1:48:58] <MyNameIsRasus> FINE MESSAGE

[1:49:08] <%A_German_spy> THIS is a fun one.
[1:49:10] <LVL1_Scumbag> His anus is loose and relaxed
[1:49:11] <CappuccinoGuil> That club? Pretty great
[1:49:15] <amritadyne> that club is great
[1:49:20] <%tank7013> Am I misremembering or is there a bridge that doesn't break if your gear is light enough?
[1:49:24] <X2Eliah> Big good club
[1:49:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Welcome to the Large Club and Great Club Club
[1:49:29] <Matermind0> The large and great great club club
[1:49:29] <prime_name> Eh, it's a bit overhyped. There are better clubs
[1:49:29] <+0neReeler> in da club
[1:49:40] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean he has equal str and dex at this point
[1:49:42] <CappuccinoGuil> I'd expect a great club to have great scaling
[1:49:45] <Solidnick18> unga bunga
[1:49:50] <dundore77> theres 1 reason to get a club and its to keep it at level 0 and do thing with it
[1:49:53] <%A_German_spy> @prime_name Its stats aren't really relevant. Its knockback effect is what you use this weapon for.
[1:49:56] <MyNameIsRasus> So if he wanted he could become a str character
[1:49:56] <brunoberserk> B O N K
[1:50:01] <jorniev> *CLUBBED TO DEAD PLAYS*
[1:50:06] <%blerrger19> Welcome to club club, time to respec so you can get back your points in int and dex, then dump them all into strength
[1:50:18] <%A_German_spy> @prime_name It's the earliest knockback weapon you can get. Early Storm Ruler substitute, basically.
[1:50:31] <andre11dr> Sadly DBS is kinda the same shit but way better

[2:01:25] <%blerrger19> @Johannen I think Woolie has done an adequate job of beating the basics into him by now, especially after 4-1 and Tower Knight before that, but they're not training wheels--they're training weights and this is only 10% of his power
[2:01:33] <Johannen> @A_German_spy Are there any enemies that are resistant to magic? I only remeber switching of my miracle mace in 4-2 for Deaths

[2:06:18] <andre11dr> iea 2-2 is way more interesting than this
[2:06:26] <%Javaa01> Send away the steel slab, you can't carry it with a good roll
[2:06:37] <jorniev> I really hope that news that ea lost the star wars licence is real
[2:06:51] <amritadyne> 2-2 is really annoying until you realise it's not LUL
[2:07:32] <Equirah> they're the exact same
[2:07:38] <+BusterRepukken> EA isnt losing it
[2:07:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> 3 points
[2:07:54] <DukeBlack_> i feel like this is a none issue
[2:07:57] <derap41> steel Shield is so pointless
[2:07:57] <%Javaa01> And it's 20% heavier
[2:08:04] <OokamiDen02> it's heavier as well
[2:08:05] <LongJackSilver> They're the same picture
[2:08:18] <%baronblank> but steel is heavier than feathers...
[2:08:22] <RyuuAoi> You can always go back. Loads very quickly
[2:08:27] <+Axle13j> Yeah not really worth, unless you just really like it
[2:08:27] <resloxxx> @baronblank LUL
[2:09:06] <+PkSilent01> oh its a vtuber

[2:09:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the Pat weapon
[2:09:31] <+askalta> looks cool tho
[2:09:39] <rosemon5001> peter pan dagger
[2:09:58] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus No
[2:10:01] <amritadyne> no, casting only
[2:10:02] <andre11dr> This weapon is a cool concept that sadly just kinda ends up being bad
[2:10:02] <+askalta> only casts
[2:10:03] <Equirah> casting only
[2:10:03] <crimsonsaens> It does not apply to weapons
[2:10:04] <Wessuri> and levelling it scaled the magic buff too, it's amazing
[2:10:04] <derap41> needs to be out and is only for spells
[2:10:21] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Equipment that buffs magic doesn't affect the magic damage of your weapons. Only that of your Sorcery.
[2:10:33] <+chiazam> pull the lever kronk
[2:11:04] <Solidnick18> now we moving
[2:11:05] <+Axle13j> Almost wrong lever
[2:11:05] <BlackermanZX> MGS elevator
[2:11:05] <Equirah> is it okay to say he missed a whole area?
[2:11:11] <crimsonsaens> When's the elevator mimic?
[2:11:12] <%cache_22> Metal Gear Solid had the best elevator fight.
[2:11:15] <Johannen> Elevator level in Souls Game...was it ever done?
[2:11:17] <peachy996> or dead space
[2:11:33] <andre11dr> @a_german_spy Does that count towards buffs as well?
[2:11:38] <%Amaideus> Closest would be the Duke's Archives
[2:11:47] <%A_German_spy> @andre11dr What do you mean?

[2:22:12] <%ekodrop> reggie the crow
[2:22:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Not just the souls, shiny gone forever
[2:22:16] <hazeprojekt> I remember losing 40k souls in a run once and not even caring
[2:22:18] <+MisleadingEchoes> Who played this game for the first time and didn't lose a thon?
[2:22:26] <RyuuAoi> He's making the map, Woolie! Give him a break!
[2:22:28] <%A_German_spy> @wicketpelican The point is, it's a lesson to learn.

[2:22:56] <+Axle13j> Its fine
[2:22:57] <DaBigVitus> they didn't notice the loot being gone yet? or yes?
[2:22:58] <ChungusQuest> oh no, that one was a Pure Spiderstone :(
[2:23:01] <+MisleadingEchoes> @A_German_spy sure but beating around it isn't learning. The item he can get for other stuff. As woolie just said, doesn't matter
[2:23:03] <+chiazam> oh so close
[2:23:08] <%ekodrop> confession to make
[2:23:23] <notsoy> what do you do with spiderstones? poison? or more general?
[2:23:23] <Wessuri> @ChungusQuest I think you get pure spiderstone from beating this boss right?

[2:23:43] <%A_German_spy> @wicketpelican In the grand scheme, no, it doesn't. But the lesson is losing something that, while not crucial, would have been useful.

[2:34:04] <+b_aleph> finally
[2:34:05] <djblue_shift> does he not notice when he's webbed?

[2:34:30] <+0neReeler> regen not effective vs spiderman
[2:34:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what if you just have the shield on his back with the fire shield equipped
[2:34:33] <%Amaideus> He's having trouble because the webbed particle is hard to tell when you're a phantom
[2:34:38] <%Amaideus> Because it's white on white
[2:34:39] <Johannen> @djblue_shift Remake is kidna bad with visuals, not that clear on the webs

[2:36:11] <dundore77> @A_German_spy is there still the one safe spot where the fire doesn't hit?
[2:36:11] <Lizard0TM> So, they made that plan of blocking the fire
[2:36:17] <ASpiffyGoat> hey maybe next time reggie checks that tunnel his best friend patches will show up and give him a useful item
[2:36:23] <Lizard0TM> but Reggie didn't equip the knight shield?
[2:36:24] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ You mean have him equip both shields in the left hand? He could, but it would overburden him and he wouldn't be able to fast-roll

[2:36:32] <dinnydanny777> He's got a glorious laugh
[2:36:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @A_German_spy ah ok, thanks
[2:36:45] <%A_German_spy> @dundore77 There are a couple, actually. But that's only useful for the ranged strat, and Reggie's using a melee setup.
[2:36:46] <notsoy> you can carry 2 different things but both will weigh you down
[2:36:51] <RyuuAoi> Woolie "Coach" Madden
[2:36:52] <KaiserMario> "you've got to hit him Woolie!"
[2:36:54] <+chiazam> why does Reggie even use that backstep attack
[2:37:00] <Lizard0TM> Take off the kunai!

[2:39:45] <KillMyPast> Armor Spider plays Injustice 2 for sure
[2:39:53] <RyuuAoi> Get in there, Reggie!
[2:40:05] <%blerrger19> @ronin19xx I mean he just ate grass? as an immediate response??
[2:40:17] <+Deekman> 100% physical block right?
[2:40:21] <Crashfan01> Armor spider says Zod vs Lex luthor is a fair matchup
[2:40:21] <KgKid51> this boss was pretty fun imo
[2:40:22] <KillMyPast> Why block then roll
[2:40:29] <bevyrage> bad habit
[2:40:30] <dundore77> why is he backing off?
[2:40:35] <%blerrger19> Learning
[2:40:36] <Lizard0TM> oil
[2:40:37] <+chiazam> why is he backing off so much
[2:40:38] <stormhawk9891> Reggie you have to hit them
[2:40:40] <plughead_> he's forgetting how to heal
[2:40:40] <peachy996> That's why
[2:40:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Dammit fighting game players, Reggie you can't Bait out his special move
[2:40:43] <KillMyPast> This run is done
[2:40:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you got this reggie
[2:40:45] <Pookiedaexzile> its not a person
[2:40:46] <KaiserMario> "Woolie, you have to hit him!" _ Patrick Boivin
[2:40:46] <RyuuAoi> Don't fear the reaper
[2:40:49] <ronin19xx> Hes watching
[2:40:54] <ronin19xx> Learning
[2:40:56] <Crashfan01> that's an ayyyylieen
[2:40:58] <%BlueJoneleth> use the force
[2:41:08] <KgKid51> nooo
[2:41:11] <%ekodrop> why roll
[2:41:15] <cosmicgoatee> why roll
[2:41:15] <RyuuAoi> Two hand and roll
[2:41:17] <prime_name> I wish the webs were a different color than the soul form.
[2:41:17] <Lizard0TM> Has Woolie said "Drop your shield" at all?
[2:41:26] <+chiazam> ye
[2:41:28] <%ekodrop> 100% damage reduction
[2:41:31] <RyuuAoi> Never not double fisting
[2:41:34] <ronin19xx> Literally bodied
[2:41:39] <plughead_> I think he hasn't clued in that the webs on the sides of the arena can also give him the webbed up status
[2:41:40] <T_Sasquatch> I feel like if you have a shield don't bother rolling unless its a flatten attack
[2:41:41] <Darren716> Feels like Quelog was a do over of this fight
[2:41:46] <+b_aleph> DROP THE SHIELD REGGIE
[2:41:48] <socratetris> with how aggressice Reggie plays, he might be better at Bloodborne
[2:41:54] <%RaziWraith> Yoga Flame!
[2:41:56] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus This fight is more like Sagat tho
[2:41:58] <%blerrger19> backseating.exe
[2:42:01] <+Axle13j> Just win 4Head
[2:42:06] <RyuuAoi> PLACE YOUR SHIELD ON THE FLOOR
[2:42:12] <ronin19xx> Not so much every time
[2:42:13] <%RaziWraith> damn these dudes look oogly in the remake. I love it LUL
[2:42:28] <ASpiffyGoat> you could also stick to one handing, and keep the shield ready to block
[2:42:29] <Paperware> @Darren716 Just like how Bed of Chaos was a do-over of Dragon God...oh nooooo
[2:42:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Makes sense
[2:42:48] <+Axle13j> @paperware LUL
[2:43:00] <Lizard0TM> Reggie never learns
[2:43:04] <KaiserMario> Fireballs a long range, uppercuts and knees at close
[2:43:08] <linSP> now I’m glad I tanked the fire damage with water veil here
[2:43:21] <plughead_> that was downright dirty
[2:43:23] <+b_aleph> sick
[2:43:35] <slix3431> Reggie shouldn't you know how to dodge a fireball? MVGame
[2:43:40] <cosmicgoatee> Amazing
[2:43:41] <+Axle13j> Outfucked!
[2:43:48] <RyuuAoi> PROFRESS
[2:43:52] <RyuuAoi> PROGRESS
[2:44:16] <+OneManX> it is amazing how just blocking helps when the fight is a straight line
[2:44:20] <ronin19xx> Not super gimmick
[2:44:29] <ASpiffyGoat> you got this reggie stay focused and dont panic
[2:44:38] <T_Sasquatch> Souls rolling is weird. Bloodborns is the only fromsoft game i like to dodge in
[2:44:45] <+Axle13j> LETS GOOO
[2:44:58] <+ItsCaptainDisco> How many times has "Drop Your Shield" been said in this chat?
[2:44:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:45:09] <KillMyPast> ??
[2:45:11] <Lizard0TM> Reggie you have the shield, you don't need to dodge if you BLOCK
[2:45:12] <ronin19xx> ????
[2:45:15] <ChungusQuest> you were webbed anyway
[2:45:16] <%cvp5127> whats grass LUL
[2:45:18] <brunoberserk> heal ?
[2:45:18] <bevyrage> reggie doesn't have the 'drop your shield' problem
[2:45:20] <+Deekman> 100% physical shield T_T
[2:45:23] <%baronblank> reggie please don't block when you don't have your shield out
[2:45:24] <ronin19xx> Shield?
[2:45:26] <slix3431> So has Reggie noticed the easiest way to kill this boss?
[2:45:33] <+Axle13j> Oof
[2:45:34] <bevyrage> no reggie hasn't figured that part out yet
[2:45:38] <stormhawk9891> @slix3431 nope
[2:45:51] <slix3431> Cause I haven't played this game, and I think I've seen it
[2:45:58] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus The Adjudicator shield taught Reggie the wrong lessons about healing, now he forgot the timing to heal LUL
[2:45:58] <T_Sasquatch> The not dying part is the easiest way Kappa
[2:46:06] <cosmicgoatee> Woolie give him "the tip" KappaPride
[2:46:17] <%blerrger19> "If you're in his face, why not two-hand?" --Woolie "That sword is not gonna block a ton of damage" --also Woolie
[2:46:29] <linSP> Don’t tell him about the cheese corner
[2:46:32] <ronin19xx> Im at ng 16 and MAN that fire storm against this boss
[2:46:32] <Lizard0TM> NotLikeThis
[2:46:39] <stormhawk9891> LUL LUL LUL
[2:46:42] <bevyrage> pretty sure they removed the cheese corner
[2:46:43] <+Axle13j> I mean, you got plenty of time to go from 2 handing to 1 hand and blocking
[2:46:45] <ChungusQuest> The Flame has been fed.
[2:46:47] <Pookiedaexzile> those are contradicting statements @blerrger19
[2:46:58] <Pookiedaexzile> aren't*
[2:47:04] <+Axle13j> ^
[2:47:18] <dinnydanny777> So how does the fire spider live in it's cave of webs without an accident happening anyway
[2:47:28] <%blerrger19> I mean, yea? The problem Reggie is having is that he can't roll when webbed and he can't block effectively while two-handing either

[2:47:43] <stormhawk9891> @dinnydanny777 By being fire resistant
[2:47:51] <%blerrger19> He has no way to avoid taking damage if he keeps getting webbed while two-handing
[2:48:12] <%baronblank> oh man this hallway totally is practice for armor spider huh
[2:48:22] <bevyrage> then he just takes out his shield and eats the hit with a block
[2:48:28] <+Axle13j> ^
[2:48:37] <%baronblank> same
[2:48:37] <%RyTYoung> Des imitates life Kappa
[2:48:40] <bevyrage> the problem is he isn't internalizing that concept while still being aware of it
[2:48:45] <ChungusQuest> Quick switching is a fantastic skill to learn
[2:48:47] <+QueequegTheater> Have we met gold boy at any point yet
[2:48:48] <%Amaideus> L E V E L D E S I G N
[2:48:48] <KgKid51> this is the one
[2:48:52] <That_Mojo> I'm pretty sure reggie's got it covered, it's just practice/execution at this point
[2:48:58] <RyuuAoi> It's almost as if video game levels prepare you for the boss at the end KappaPride
[2:48:59] <Oscarthemowerman> god souls games are so good at teaching that isn't just saying the lesson bluntly
[2:49:13] <deadbrainpl> He just likes his buns toasted LUL
[2:49:14] <glass_marcus> he even kind of lights the whole room on fire like the spider does
[2:49:46] <Crashfan01> Tiger! Tiger!
[2:49:53] <+QueequegTheater> Maybe if you keep blocking long enough he'll get intimidated and run away
[2:49:57] <+QueequegTheater> KappaD
[2:49:59] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[2:49:59] <+QueequegTheater> KappaHD
[2:50:03] <%tank7013> If they really wanted to ready you for this fight it might have been good to place a couple little spider enemies near the end here.
[2:50:05] <plughead_> ayy finally healed
[2:50:12] <cosmicgoatee> Kappa
[2:50:17] <ASpiffyGoat> I think instead of "drop your shield" this is "raise your shield"
[2:50:21] <KaiserMario> 100% physical dmg reduction huh... why bother...
[2:50:29] <bevyrage> nah instead of spider enemies they should have just added in webbing earlier into the level
[2:50:31] <+Axle13j> Not even close babyyy!
[2:50:40] <bevyrage> get you use to recognizing the webbing and how it affects your mobility
[2:50:47] <+chiazam> m
[2:51:02] <+Deekman> oh god just block
[2:51:02] <+chiazam> hrmm
[2:51:05] <+Axle13j> lolol
[2:51:07] <cosmicgoatee> Reggie voicing his attacks makes me chuckle
[2:51:15] <peachy996> spooky
[2:51:18] <BurdRightsActivist> WEB BALL, REALITY STONE
[2:51:23] <sendart> reggie can't decide if he wants to be a roll or block boy
[2:51:25] <%tank7013> @bevyrage Yea, that was the idea. Getting the player used to not just the ground web, but the shots as well
[2:51:26] <Lizard0TM> NOW HE LEARNS IT
[2:51:28] <deadbrainpl> I mean I think this boss was just put into it because they didn't have time - just remember it's literally from their previous game (Ninja Blade)
[2:51:35] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[2:51:35] <%Javaa01> This is literally the "Learn not to panic roll" bossfight
[2:51:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Roll
[2:51:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Blocking will get you killed her
[2:51:47] <KgKid51> gotta start doing damage bro
[2:51:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Cue the Str boys
[2:51:53] <RyuuAoi> Can stop the bum rush?
[2:51:58] <KgKid51> hggShaq

[2:51:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:52:00] <Crashfan01> Perfect!
[2:52:08] <Johannen> @deadbrainpl Its a 100% copy down to the arena and mechanics or only the model?
[2:52:09] <RyuuAoi> @pookiedaexzile Where dey at doe?
[2:52:12] <+chiazam> why does he unlock sometimes?
[2:52:13] <%DeaconBluesClues> that aint a real mixup
[2:52:25] <%baronblank> this fight is essentially, learn to properly alternate blocking and dodging, or dodge everything perfectly
[2:52:31] <+Axle13j> Niiice!
[2:52:31] <cosmicgoatee> he's afraid of 2 handing
[2:52:32] <%RyTYoung> YES
[2:52:32] <Pookiedaexzile> TWO hands
[2:52:35] <KgKid51> LETS GO
[2:52:36] <Crashfan01> ayyy he's got this!
[2:52:36] <+QueequegTheater> He's becoming a real boy
[2:52:36] <+Deekman> Perfect

[2:52:44] <%blerrger19> @baronblank or you could just block
[2:52:45] <ASpiffyGoat> lets go reggie!
[2:52:51] <%RyTYoung> SICK
[2:52:53] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[2:52:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Two handing is way too unsafe for Reg at his skill level
[2:52:58] <%za7az> Greed
[2:53:04] <dinnydanny777> That didn't count as a hit LUL
[2:53:07] <bevyrage> shield reggie plz
[2:53:10] <dinnydanny777> But it pushed you LUL
[2:53:11] <andre11dr> Im back from eating, dose he got it?

[2:53:44] <cosmicgoatee> Reggie doing quantum equations
[2:53:45] <That_Mojo> i think people fail to remember how hard it is to put all these skills into action the first time
[2:53:45] <RyuuAoi> He needs two hands
[2:53:57] <%tank7013> too bad*
[2:53:59] <+chiazam> is this a depth perception thing
[2:53:59] <Lizard0TM> he moved out of the way
[2:53:59] <BlackermanZX> half health cmon

[2:56:33] <%MrKerb> lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[2:56:34] <ChungusQuest> Reggie has disembarked the Tilt-A-Whirl
[2:56:35] <%tank7013> Yea it wasn't perfect but you still did great. The boss being dead is proof of that
[2:56:39] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Have we met the spiky gold boy yet
[2:56:39] <MyNameIsRasus> 4 sessions, 4 bosses

[2:57:05] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie this is the Souls experience. Trial and error and overcoming the challenge
[2:57:08] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus I found that most levels give more souls in items then in just killing enemies
[2:57:08] <deadbrainpl> That boss is a bitch for first-timers so congrats Reg, you got it down pretty fast
[2:57:13] <prime_name> Does DeS have a soft cap for stats?
[2:57:15] <+QueequegTheater> trapp'd
[2:57:19] <%ChoculaUltra> wait, the Maiden's mouf don't moved like the other npcs? Has it been telepathic comms this whole time?!
[2:57:22] <BurdRightsActivist> trapp'd
[2:57:25] <bevyrage> yeah soft cap is about 40?
[2:57:25] <Paperware> Supidah Man is a fight you really need to learn to beat but becomes much easier the second time around
[2:57:25] <%megaman_sentinel> did he do it
[2:57:38] <Pookiedaexzile> HARD
[2:57:43] <%Amaideus> Man, i love when the souls are individualized
[2:57:44] <%A_German_spy> @prime_name Most stats do. Not all.
[2:57:47] <+QueequegTheater> @ChoculaUltra None of the NPCs are supposed to have moving mouths.
[2:57:51] <RyuuAoi> BIG TWO HAND DAMAGE
[2:58:06] <andre11dr> @choculaultra Iea , same thing with the Monumental
[2:58:13] <ronin19xx> Are we lurking today????
[2:58:13] <%blerrger19> @QueequegTheater No? the remake has facial animations
[2:58:20] <%ChoculaUltra> interesting!
[2:58:24] <+QueequegTheater> @blerrger19 And they shouldn't
[2:58:45] <%blerrger19> @QueequegTheater wtf does that even mean? Mouths shouldn't move when talking??
[2:58:55] <%Amaideus> Not in Souls
[2:58:56] <+QueequegTheater> The original game didn't have them moving
[2:58:56] <%ekodrop> tower a latrine?
[2:59:00] <%Amaideus> That's blasphemy
[2:59:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:59:08] <derap41> 10 faith for a heal spell
[2:59:14] <+QueequegTheater> BluePoint added significance that wasn't there originally
[2:59:26] <%blerrger19> "significance"
[2:59:57] <andre11dr> It makes sense considering Allant
[3:00:01] <KaiserMario> Wait, did Reggie say 2x800=1200?
[3:00:05] <Johannen> I feel its better to not have them move, having a good loop on a static character is hard, with moving mouths you can see thier "reset" to neutral, kinda takes you out
[3:00:09] <+QueequegTheater> They should have given everyone mouth animations or given no one mouth animations
[3:00:13] <ChungusQuest> Makes one wonder if Maiden's animations got missed, or if they were intentionally left out. Maybe she *is* telepathic.
[3:00:13] <%Amaideus> God I wish they'd say how much each gives on them
[3:00:25] <Pookiedaexzile> But that would be easy
[3:00:31] <stormhawk9891> QUICK MAFFS
[3:00:41] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Consider reapairing some stuff too...

[3:01:53] <%blerrger19> @QueequegTheater ok, good point but I'm still confused why you say they "shouldn't" or what this "significance" is

[3:08:37] <StarlitStunner> bitterPun
[3:09:42] <%clempstwitch> @MrPedrovsky Slow but steady :)
[3:09:54] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can also equip a lighter body piece. The one you have on now is super heavy. Lighter body armor will free up room for gloves and/or a helmet.
[3:10:11] <%MrPedrovsky> @clempstwitch Nice. Hey, how familiar are you with Ys?
[3:10:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Or you could roll outta the way
[3:10:54] <%blerrger19> Naked run!
[3:10:54] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's good up to a point. Heavy armor in this game has exponentially decreasing defense-to-weight ratios, so a full set of lighter armor can give you more total defense than one piece of heavy armor and two empty slots.
[3:11:06] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Matter of personal preference, in the end.
[3:11:14] <Pookiedaexzile> "If I wasnt bitch made who would find the true warriors
[3:11:31] <Blank9> flame toss gives a different damage type

[3:12:24] <derap41> great for lizards
[3:12:32] <deadbrainpl> Man it fucks me up to see a fire spell in a Souls game and it being magic and not Pyromancy
[3:12:40] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[3:12:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's not a de-aggro
[3:12:43] <%RaziWraith> It will not save your ass LUL
[3:12:44] <Pookiedaexzile> IT's useless
[3:12:44] <derap41> Water Veil would have been super good
[3:12:56] <BurdRightsActivist> Water Veil's gonna be useful
[3:13:00] <%Amaideus> Familiar's Prank is the secret OP option

[3:13:59] <%blerrger19> @A_German_spy I'm a little disappointed Reggie has the enchant weapon spell but isn't using it since he picked up the crescent falchion. I would really like to see him use and upgrade the kilij, but also don't want to backseat. Think you can spin it in a nice way?
[3:14:01] <%Amaideus> @WoolieVersus Human
[3:14:07] <%asdief_> jump
[3:14:13] <andre11dr> NOBODY SAY SHIT
[3:14:13] <+Grayhammatter> human
[3:14:20] <sendart> do a flip
[3:14:22] <%asdief_> do a fip
[3:14:22] <djblue_shift> damn it
[3:14:26] <+Grayhammatter> do a FLIP
[3:14:27] <peachy996> Stop saying Eldritch Woolie you're giving Latria a bad name
[3:14:28] <%SuckerPunchSyd> You gonna die? Your still a human lad
[3:14:29] <%A_German_spy> @blerrger19 They'll get there. It just has to happen at Reggie's pace.
[3:14:29] <Josef_Stryker> DO A FLIP
[3:14:29] <andre11dr> Danm it
[3:14:32] <+vaderxyz1970> NOOOOOOOOO

[3:14:43] <%Amaideus> If it weren't for Tendency I'd have kept quiet
[3:14:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so you wanna see a new area or further explore?
[3:14:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> suicide is badass (it's not)
[3:14:48] <andre11dr> I want to Storm Ruler Reggie around :(
[3:14:51] <%Amaideus> But Tuck Fendency
[3:14:56] <peachy996> It's the Hopeful Happy Prison everything is nice there
[3:14:58] <+patriotrenegade> No Latria!
[3:15:01] <%A_German_spy> @blerrger19 He still has a lot to absorb, and the more manageable that is for him, the better this will go.
[3:15:01] <%ekodrop> LUKER!!!
[3:15:03] <%blerrger19> @A_German_spy Fair, he just seems confused about his choices in weapons/sorcery
[3:15:05] <BurdRightsActivist> @Amaideus No Yuck Fou
[3:15:06] <ronin19xx> Were lurking boys!
[3:15:10] <%Razputin217> I believe I can fly
[3:15:11] <+ttvp> Nooooo bullying Reggie
[3:15:19] <deadbrainpl> YEYEYE time to lurk!
[3:15:22] <%Amaideus> Rao, Wude @BurdRightsActivist
[3:15:23] <%A_German_spy> @blerrger19 Yeah, it's a little much to try to push on him now. All in good time.
[3:15:26] <%Lion_kun> 2-2 is gonna take a while
[3:15:34] <BurdRightsActivist> 2-2 Time 4Head
[3:15:40] <%blerrger19> @A_German_spy What really concerns me is the long-road, what direction his build takes, but at this juncture its not like he's going to take such a huge misstep he can't simply undo later
[3:15:45] <%lil_pudintater9> Has he bought any new spells to try?
[3:15:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Catch 2-2
[3:15:50] <andre11dr> 2-2 will be a long while
[3:16:01] <%Amaideus> LATRIA TIME BOIS

[3:16:09] <djblue_shift> 2-2 is gonna be fun with how well he's internalized maps so far LUL LUL
[3:16:10] <%blerrger19> And even calling it a misstep is inaccurate
[3:16:13] <linSP> Gogogo
[3:16:14] <%A_German_spy> @blerrger19 This isn't going to be an optimized build no matter what. A first playthrough is a throwaway character for learning and trying things out.

[3:45:23] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You can not in fact pick them back up afterward
[3:45:25] <%Javaa01> Or more importantly, draw fight rings for PvP
[3:45:29] <brunoberserk> BURACK SETOO
[3:45:37] <heartlesshealer> you typically don't get to pick those breadcrumbs back up, but they're cheap

[3:46:28] <+Ether101_Prime> The Weeb Soul still burns, I see.
[3:46:42] <%Amaideus> Holy shit the stat to weight ratio
[3:46:49] <Oscarthemowerman> way better for a ratio of defense to weight
[3:46:56] <%Amaideus> What the fuck DeS
[3:46:59] <redrins> much lighter, slightly worse, good shit
[3:47:02] <Equirah> drops by 10, get things that are better in other slots
[3:47:06] <ChungusQuest> can probably keep heaview gloves and boots, too
[3:47:12] <%Javaa01> 1/10th the weight for a sub 30% reduction in defense stats
[3:47:13] <usurper_sos> now you can hold a bigger shield or a bigger weapon
[3:47:15] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Plus the black gloves and legs, yeah
[3:47:20] <Johannen> Leather or Padded armor is legit. Shadiversity tought me that
[3:47:25] <%A_German_spy> Exactly

[3:48:03] <%Amaideus> He'd get similar results going with the chest piece and swapping out the pants
[3:48:14] <%Amaideus> IF he really wants that fashion

[3:48:16] <ronin19xx> Lookin slick tho
[3:48:22] <MadBaller123> The soul series are just fashion simulators
[3:48:30] <ChungusQuest> better defense?
[3:48:31] <Equirah> ....... he just too a - on all slots but headpiece
[3:48:46] <%r0chelimit> or the big shield!
[3:48:46] <amritadyne> ammo does not add to equip weight
[3:48:47] <notsoy> or both shields lol
[3:48:53] <Equirah> at least upgrade the glove a boots slot
[3:49:14] <andre11dr> Well, this zone is perfect if your looking for spells
[3:49:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> is Bow actually viable?
[3:49:25] <heartlesshealer> sword
[3:49:25] <That_Mojo> i believe marcus was doing a bow only run
[3:49:25] <usurper_sos> Remember to magic buff your sword
[3:49:27] <heartlesshealer> reggie
[3:49:30] <plughead_> Can't reggie actually rock the armor body with this setup?
[3:49:39] <That_Mojo> er, ENB
[3:49:40] <%Amaideus> Probably
[3:49:43] <amritadyne> @LiquidDinosaur more than viable, Sticky is a VERY strong upgrade path
[3:49:48] <laguerrilha> my current game of DS3 i put all in vit so i could use any armor and roll

[3:51:02] <+YPFrost> @Zayasu hi :)
[3:51:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So I wanna point out, normally a single attack from that guy in the Iron Maiden is enough to inflict poison, but because Reggie's wearing the full Black Leather set now, his Poison resistance is high enough that it took two hits.
[3:51:11] <heartlesshealer> poof
[3:51:41] <%lil_pudintater9> Nice poison resist btw
[3:51:45] <ChungusQuest> man, that bleed is doing work
[3:51:52] <laguerrilha> @Equirah yeah i dont know how i am doing so much dmg with the claymore and low strg/dex
[3:51:56] <djblue_shift> yeah that bleed is nice
[3:51:59] <+MisleadingEchoes> His bleed is doing crazy damage
[3:52:04] <%Amaideus> HE DIDN'T DO IT

[4:01:11] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Might I suggest Reggie try the Uchi for this zone for a bit, the magic doesn't do much for the Mind Flayers
[4:01:24] <Pookiedaexzile> She dummy Busted, but classy
[4:01:29] <+MisleadingEchoes> Wow shes fucked up, first time saw her like this
[4:01:36] <usurper_sos> :look:

[4:03:08] <That_Mojo> there's those augite things for breadd crumbs
[4:03:09] <usurper_sos> That ring tho
[4:03:10] <Johannen> Augite is so cheap
[4:03:16] <andre11dr> I think she talks about the King later
[4:03:26] <dinnydanny777> Stab them with the pointy end
[4:03:37] <laguerrilha> Rapier are so cool
[4:04:04] <usurper_sos> Are you into fencing, Reggarth?
[4:04:25] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> Left-hand rapier is great for tight corners.
[4:04:31] <heartlesshealer> guard + vertical
[4:04:34] <LunarRemix> It has a higher parry frame than regular shields
[4:04:55] <%Javaa01> Farm ring

[4:05:06] <+Grayhammatter> DEBAUCHERY
[4:05:08] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Reggie is talking about switching his shield for a rapier in the left hand, because it is said in the description
[4:05:10] <heartlesshealer> vomitarium is a speech thing
[4:05:10] <Pookiedaexzile> TAX CUT RING
[4:05:10] <laguerrilha> irl bucklers were good to bash people in the head too
[4:05:16] <KaiserMario> To talk
[4:05:22] <%lil_pudintater9> 1% ring
[4:05:23] <heartlesshealer> oh
[4:05:24] <%wibbwobbler> lol
[4:05:26] <Slim_Lipid> It's where the building vomits :)
[4:05:33] <Darren716> it's where the people "spew out"
[4:05:33] <heartlesshealer> I'm thinking of something else then
[4:05:46] <HeroToxiko> shout out to the cree pretending they were the inhumans and making the entire black bolt illuminati arc make zero sense
[4:05:47] <+Jaysky> Are any of these the elden ring?
[4:05:47] <heartlesshealer> cool lessons
[4:05:48] <RamenRiderZ> It's where you vomit out words
[4:05:51] <Darren716> That's how my Latin teacher explained it
[4:05:55] <%Javaa01> However, it is the nausea level in ROTT
[4:06:10] <+askalta> estoc soon tho
[4:06:12] <That_Mojo> do it
[4:06:17] <%krispen_wa> stepped out for a few hours, did reg beat 2-1 already?
[4:06:26] <bevyrage> vomi means an expanded receptical in which things are held before being expelled or exiting the main body, be that architecture or the human form
[4:06:26] <usurper_sos> Try it out
[4:06:27] <%BlueJoneleth> yeah
[4:06:46] <+Grayhammatter> try it out, not in here though
[4:06:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Is rapier OP here like it is in Dark 1 and 2?
[4:07:01] <bevyrage> rapier isn't OP in any souls game, you're thinking of the estoc @fruit_pie_the_magician
[4:07:02] <heartlesshealer> you are alive as long as you have souls
[4:07:13] <+Graxe_> She can stay here for a little bit longer
[4:07:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Tell that to the ice rapier
[4:07:36] <bevyrage> you mean crystal enchantment
[4:07:39] <Oscarthemowerman> the sanity economy
[4:07:48] <%BisoromiBear> She became a burusera girl to support her soul addiction
[4:07:49] <bevyrage> which is still better on estoc than rapier
[4:07:55] <+Sharmanyx> Plan to watch this on YT but just want to tell Reggie great job and it's awesome to see you learning along the way!
[4:07:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> no i mean the ice rapier
[4:08:03] <%asdief_> prove that scalpers are soulless
[4:08:06] <+askalta> unfortunatly?
[4:08:06] <+Jaysky> You'd think a monster could kill her tho
[4:08:14] <%RyTYoung> @sharmanyx He's doing good!
[4:08:36] <%lil_pudintater9> MLG parry

[4:08:56] <BlackermanZX> DUAL WIELD doodNuts
[4:08:58] <bevyrage> ice rapier is a unique weapon in the thrusting sword family, but isn't the base rapier
[4:08:58] <LES_89> You got this reggie, do it for the fashion souls b lol.
[4:09:02] <+askalta> you can buff your left hand weapon if you put catalyst in the right
[4:09:04] <%asdief_> baller as fuck

[4:09:37] <$SilverRoddo> Latsu geto shiriasu

[4:11:46] <djblue_shift> i don't think it does
[4:11:46] <OokamiDen02> don't think so
[4:11:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus The Adjudicator Shield has to be out, otherwise you don't get its effect.
[4:11:47] <ronin19xx> !uptime
[4:11:47] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 19 minutes
[4:11:48] <laguerrilha> nope
[4:11:49] <%baronblank> can't wait for reggie to panic block with the rapier out and attack
[4:11:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Nope
[4:11:51] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus has to be in equipped slot
[4:12:04] <ChungusQuest> oh damn, that's not just spears?
[4:12:12] <Hundred_Hand_Slap> @WoolieVersus can you come over to my place and walk me through my first ever playthrough of this game?
[4:12:18] <heartlesshealer> oh, he did do it with the spear? I must have missed that, sorry
[4:12:18] <dmtjinni> WOOLZ
[4:12:23] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus When Reggie asked about trying out rapier and dual hand. When Reggie asked about parry/guard breaking you misunderstood him also
[4:12:24] <usurper_sos> I love how a guy gets called out and then never responds LUL
[4:12:28] <That_Mojo> i can't wait for reggie to parry some fool with the raiper and feel the power

[4:16:14] <Johannen> It's a kind of magic...maaagic
[4:16:39] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I know what you're getting at, and I think you're thinking of her dialogue if you leave without buying anything.

[4:16:44] <+GerryOmega> we are below nothing. we are one

[4:17:24] <%A_German_spy> She is absolutely awesome
[4:17:28] <heartlesshealer> she's great

[4:18:04] <laguerrilha> but you would think 1500 souls would be enough to keep her sane for a while
[4:18:27] <dinnydanny777> How often do people visit this place to buy stuff anyway
[4:18:32] <OblivionSword1> did reggie switch from 2-1 to 3-1 ?
[4:18:39] <heartlesshealer> special cell
[4:18:40] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen @djblue_shift It was hard to tell in the original. Her face in that version did look a lot more like a mask, but it had a fleshy appearance to it such that it might have just been disfigurement from torture. Graphical limitations made it pretty unclear.
[4:18:41] <%Amaideus> He beat 2-1
[4:18:45] <OblivionSword1> ah ok
[4:18:47] <%Amaideus> Did 3-1 instead of 2-2
[4:18:47] <OblivionSword1> cool
[4:18:54] <+Grayhammatter> oh, it's freak
[4:18:54] <OokamiDen02> found the freak
[4:18:56] <usurper_sos> Magic man
[4:19:00] <dinnydanny777> He is Frick
[4:19:07] <%Lion_kun> he got the good shit
[4:19:10] <laguerrilha> I think you are the first person she sold something. preobably got the idea on the spot to get some souls
[4:19:18] <%megaman_sentinel> ppl r looking 4 this guy?
[4:19:20] <heartlesshealer> find key, get man
[4:19:23] <RamenRiderZ> "Hey kid, help me out of here"
[4:19:30] <Darren716> Is Reggie an FoF? Friend of Freke?
[4:19:32] <jfp4life> I've played OG demon's souls so many times, I never knew you could shoot those bodies off the ceiling
[4:19:33] <jorniev> FREAK N YOU
[4:19:33] <%Amaideus> Dang it
[4:19:34] <+Grayhammatter> find key, get man
[4:19:37] <%Amaideus> Another hole avoided
[4:19:38] <mihokspawn> Time to get freeky
[4:19:40] <%Lion_kun> I am shocked Reggie hasn't fallen into a hole.
[4:19:51] <prime_name> Freken and Viben!
[4:20:04] <%Amaideus> @Darren716 Underrated comment btw
[4:20:04] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun He learned that lesson pretty early, haha
[4:20:13] <heartlesshealer> twinkle twinkle
[4:20:37] <heartlesshealer> bye wall item
[4:20:47] <Johannen> That remind me @A_German_spy Have you seen the game Hard Truck Apocalypse/Ex Machina. They could not do faces so they gaveeveryone masks and explained it by poisonous atmosphear

[4:25:11] <amritadyne> this scrub got bodied lmao
[4:25:11] <+Undenizen> wait, so what items do you keep and what items do you NOT keep?
[4:25:12] <%RaziWraith> At least he is not having a conniption fit THE ENTIRE TIME you are in this zone. LUL
[4:25:17] <linSP> Yes you can loot his body
[4:25:23] <Blank9> rydell's staff there rules
[4:25:23] <%Lion_kun> I thought Freke did the HNRGHHHHHH
[4:25:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> why the faces gotta look like that
[4:25:45] <linSP> Frekes just chillin
[4:25:47] <jfp4life> WWT Rydell gives a ring i think, BWT rydell drops his weapon
[4:25:48] <%A_German_spy> @Lion_kun That was this guy
[4:25:54] <amritadyne> there's a cool thing about him?
[4:26:01] <laguerrilha> In this wold you dont become a undead, you become a soul form that keep fighting
[4:26:05] <%Lion_kun> LOL, what good is he, is he jsut there to make noises?
[4:26:10] <PrideOfFiddles> Rydell looks so much more Anime on Ps5
[4:26:10] <%A_German_spy> @jfp4life That's correct
[4:27:10] <%Lion_kun> being able to survive a grab from Zoidberg makes the zone much, much easier.
[4:27:18] <andre11dr> To bad he Rydell never found a homeward bone
[4:27:20] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Reggie, mashing actually works to escape grabs in future games with unique animations for it
[4:27:24] <chakax99> So why doesn't he just nexial binding his way out?
[4:27:42] <%A_German_spy> @chakax99 Shhhh spyCappa
[4:27:56] <PrideOfFiddles> Surprisingly Reggie seems to have little to no trouble navigating the Prison of Hope :)
[4:27:58] <%Amaideus> Do you only have a soul form if you're bound to the nexus?
[4:28:04] <heartlesshealer> he probably didn't trust the wax or something
[4:28:11] <heartlesshealer> yeah you missed something
[4:28:14] <%Amaideus> I don't think so, otherwise all the red phantoms would have to be bound too
[4:28:27] <%blerrger19> If he's a blue phantom then maybe not??
[4:28:28] <dodgy_dingo_> prison of hope is such a disgusting name, i love it
[4:28:28] <Josef_Stryker> He has too many souls on that corpse Kappa
[4:28:31] <heartlesshealer> this room
[4:28:33] <Blank9> message
[4:28:34] <Monkeyweed21> his wife's keepsake is like 5000 souls
[4:28:36] <heartlesshealer> damn it woolie
[4:28:37] <laguerrilha> oonly bound people become souls, the rest just die
[4:28:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> might just have butterfingers, might have dropped the item
[4:28:37] <prime_name> Can't wait for the Best of Reggie Souls where they shop in Hololive idols everytime Woolies says Idol.
[4:28:40] <brunoberserk> key
[4:28:46] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus he wants a drop on his body that would despawn if he used nexial binding
[4:28:46] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Reggie's actually right in this instance
[4:28:47] <%BlueJoneleth> you missed a few cells next to Rydell I thinnk
[4:28:49] <LunarRemix> I feel like the implication is that he's bound to the prison and if you stay in soul from for too long you just disapear like Crestfallen
[4:28:54] <amritadyne> the key is never going to be found, LP canceled
[4:29:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He missed the key between the two locked doors
[4:29:13] <%SuckerPunchSyd> At the top of the stairs
[4:29:22] <PrideOfFiddles> It's fiiiiine~
[4:29:28] <heartlesshealer> yay
[4:29:44] <ronin19xx> The what area?
[4:29:47] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Woo!
[4:29:51] <heartlesshealer> kinda mean no one put a message on that one though
[4:29:56] <Blank9> there wasn't a message on the first time through
[4:30:02] <twoto858> Cells?
[4:30:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Messages are strange
[4:30:13] <OokamiDen02> That's a good question

[4:37:40] <ronin19xx> Its incredibly heavy
[4:37:55] <+Grayhammatter> so much inventory space now
[4:37:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:37:55] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen Oh, nah, that's been a thing since Demon's. No matter what class you start as, you can get the starting gear for every other class somewhere in the game.
[4:37:58] <ronin19xx> Vergil set gone
[4:38:14] <%Risingxiv> Thats not true cause you can still find the set for your class you picked. and wouldn't the harder areas have the most sets?

[4:39:01] <%A_German_spy> @laguerrilha Bloodborne did too, yeah.

[4:42:25] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen Ohh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, no, the corpses in Bloodborne aren't starting classes specifically, they're different types of hunters with different backgrounds.
[4:42:39] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen It's okay. I just misunderstood what you were asking.
[4:42:45] <andre11dr> Also why the fuck would you make that, i understand the Old Monk is kinda crazy, but all of hes other creations seem more useful than that

[4:58:17] <%krispen_wa> Is there any boss in the Souls game that takes decent damage from poison?
[4:58:25] <%A_German_spy> Here it comes
[4:58:32] <%krispen_wa> it seems like poison only really ever is important in DS2 PvP
[4:58:36] <%A_German_spy> ...ahhh, good catch spyCappa
[4:58:39] <%RaziWraith> LUL
[4:58:45] <andre11dr> @krispen_wa This game
[4:58:51] <Monkeyweed21> @krispen_wa boss of 3-2
[4:58:55] <usurper_sos> HEY
[4:59:01] <laguerrilha> No bosses in souls take poison or toxic dmg
[4:59:01] <%Amaideus> DS2's poison is the only one aggressive enough to be potentially worth poisoning instead of raw DPSing
[4:59:02] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Two Years baby!!! Don't give up Skeletons. I know that's for DS1 but I think it still applies, in my heart
[4:59:03] <andre11dr> and 5-2
[4:59:06] <LunarRemix> There's a real problem of poison always doing flat damage against enemies
[4:59:10] <%Amaideus> Though there are some that can be cheesed
[4:59:14] <%A_German_spy> @laguerrilha Several in Demon's Souls do
[4:59:16] <andre11dr> or 5-3
[4:59:23] <%Amaideus> I remember one in the chalices that's worth poisoning
[4:59:25] <%A_German_spy> @laguerrilha Even one or two in DS3 do. Pontiff does.
[4:59:54] <amritadyne> don't give up skeleton was dark souls 2 actually, iron keep
[4:59:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1348891911097110529?s=19
[5:00:21] <andre11dr> Is BSB the only good poison fight, im struggling to think of another
[5:00:21] <%Javaa01> And now to go face the firing squad
[5:00:29] <%krispen_wa> wasn dont give up skeleton in harvest valley crawling on a rock?
[5:00:45] <%Amaideus> Good poison fight as in them using poison on you?
[5:00:48] <%A_German_spy> @krispen_wa It was Iron Keep, a skeleton half-submerged in a slag bucket
[5:00:50] <%Amaideus> Or good to poison?
[5:00:50] <amonimis> Ds3 crystal sage isn't a fan of poison lol
[5:00:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> go hug
[5:00:54] <OokamiDen02> LUL
[5:00:54] <+patriotrenegade> JESUS WANTS A HUG
[5:00:58] <amritadyne> @krispen_wa it was the lava cauldron in iron keep that had a skeleton hanging halfway out
[5:00:59] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[5:01:01] <%Javaa01> Jesus wants a hug! (with crossbow bolts)
[5:01:03] <%krispen_wa> oh no i was thinking of "listen carefully skeleton"
[5:01:08] <siamzero94> jesus packing heat
[5:01:09] <tux_3do> lmao accept jesus's love
[5:01:10] <$arcielardor> jesus wants a hug!!
[5:01:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Time to go back?
[5:01:12] <2deep5u> did anybody else see that absolutely jacked jesus statue from korea?
[5:01:19] <GoogleyGareth> If the jesus statue at my church fired fucking triple set arrows I would be much more likely to go there.
[5:01:25] <chakax99> 500 rounds of mercy a minute
[5:01:29] <peachy996> Hug Crossbow Jesus, Reggie
[5:01:42] <$arcielardor> You can tank it, Reggie!!
[5:01:44] <laguerrilha> @A_German_spy wow just checked and he not only does but it doesnt take much to proc it
[5:01:46] <zhenthrim213> Kiryu has
[5:01:47] <andre11dr> I forgot Crystal Sage even existed, i never fight him because why the fuck would i want magic in DS3
[5:01:49] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[5:01:52] <Oscarthemowerman> just parry the machinegun bullets
[5:01:56] <hazeprojekt> big roll energy time
[5:02:02] <GoogleyGareth> EMBRACE GOD
[5:02:02] <chakax99> perfect roll all of it like the speedrunners do.
[5:02:09] <laguerrilha> Just witch time the arrows
[5:02:12] <%Javaa01> Just do it perfect
[5:02:13] <+MisleadingEchoes> Wait, what is the solution of that again? I know you can roll it
[5:02:14] <%krispen_wa> Just poise through it with Giant Dad
[5:02:16] <+PulleylubeTW> fyi the trick to rolling through the arrow barrage is to quicken the rolling tempo as you get closer or they will get ya
[5:02:17] <%A_German_spy> @laguerrilha Yeah. That stupid poison weapon art on the Storyteller's Staff? It inflicts the strongest player-usable poison in the game, and it DESTROYS Pontiff
[5:02:21] <+Grayhammatter> do not embrace this god
[5:02:23] <+Graxe_> They made an achievement for rolling through that bridge
[5:02:25] <%Javaa01> Prove everyone how huge your nuts are
[5:02:26] <amritadyne> or come back here with warding and just walk through LUL
[5:02:27] <+Graxe_> Because they knew
[5:02:29] <glass_marcus> I spent a while on this perfect rolling through this because i thought there was no other way
[5:02:32] <Equirah> @andre11dr you need to in order to access the cathedral which is necessary for the boreal valley so it's all required for progression
[5:03:01] <andre11dr> Oh that's right
[5:03:07] <Johannen> My disapointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined, Woolie cant help but backseat hard
[5:03:20] <heartlesshealer> I like how people in the orb are screaming every time it casts magic
[5:03:28] <%A_German_spy> @Johannen You wanna sit here for another hour watching Reggie wander around totally lost?
[5:03:29] <Johannen> I would feel that reminding to just read the key would have done the trick
[5:03:41] <andre11dr> Oh God i should play DS3 again a have really bad memory of the early game
[5:03:41] <%Amaideus> In other areas, sure, but definitely not this one
[5:03:46] <%krispen_wa> stop being woolieONEGUY
[5:03:47] <usurper_sos> Nah, Reggie would be lost for hours
[5:03:47] <chakax99> It's a learning experience
[5:03:48] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[5:03:48] <hazeprojekt> backseating in this level is fine since its a maze
[5:03:52] <MyNameIsRasus> You're right one guy, Reggie should have just wandered around for like an additional half an hour
[5:03:53] <chakax99> be like bean dad
[5:03:53] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:03:54] <heartlesshealer> Does the warden key also open freke's cell? I stepped away from the computer for a sec

[5:04:18] <+Grayhammatter> Every time
[5:04:19] <Equirah> to be fair, it's the reason he doesn't make mental maps of the areas
[5:04:22] <%RaziWraith> Yeah Latria is big wander bait. If Reggie is fine with it, I would rather Wools tell him LUL
[5:04:25] <siamzero94> nah man i gotta sleep, guide him harder
[5:04:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggie you can't eat until you beat a souls game all by yourself

[5:30:07] <%A_German_spy> @therakishsage Woolie as the teacher, and Reggie as the student. They're rocking it.
[5:30:15] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus It was more about reading the key before leading to the exact area, it does not bother me when you give directions
[5:30:18] <Ultra_Pancake> Love seeing the Baz plush hangin in the background.
[5:30:31] <hazeprojekt> latria is fine for backseating since its a giant maze
[5:30:31] <ronin19xx> Still 1 boss per session
