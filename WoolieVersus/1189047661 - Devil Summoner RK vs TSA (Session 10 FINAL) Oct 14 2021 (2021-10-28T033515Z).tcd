[0:00:37] <@Menitta> those Millia buffs are gooooood
[0:00:47] <leith_aziz> If you're talking about what I think you talking about, yeah its hype
[0:00:51] <Archmortal> if you don't remember it did it even happen
[0:00:55] <Th3rd3> Reggie eating on this patch TPFufun
[0:00:56] <dds333a> it probably wasn't important Kappa
[0:01:02] <%livlinn> bloodstains??
[0:01:05] <Sonny_Firestorm> Anyway baby, it's Stream o'clock, time for your SMT dick flattening Kappa
[0:01:11] <andre11dr> The void universe
[0:01:19] <andre11dr> It's really bad in there
[0:01:23] <leith_aziz> Me, a biased Sol main seeing DP nerf but funner combos nicobPog
[0:01:28] <andre11dr> Nothing but sorrow
[0:01:29] <%Lion_kun> Does it no longer feel slow?
[0:01:42] <357Sneak> Striverd
[0:01:43] <leith_aziz> Guilty Gear: Pride?
[0:01:46] <leith_aziz> Same
[0:01:56] <dds333a> please
[0:01:58] <andre11dr> I want blitz back
[0:02:11] <andre11dr> I don't know why they took it away
[0:02:14] <@Solidus_113> do not bring back blitz
[0:02:18] <+EdenOfLove> So brutalities from MKX?
[0:02:27] <leith_aziz> So like slower Fatal Blows? hmmm nicobThink
[0:02:43] <leith_aziz> Blitz is weird. I dont hate it, but its really gimmicky
[0:02:44] <BlackermanZX> bring back danger time  Keepo
[0:02:53] <leith_aziz> Yes
[0:03:13] <leith_aziz> P to D
[0:03:15] <dds333a> KILLING WORLD
[0:03:23] <leith_aziz> Then some inputs with a super input
[0:03:39] <andre11dr> But has a second IK
[0:03:49] <andre11dr> You don't have to use that one
[0:04:00] <leith_aziz> I wouldnt mind if they just brought it like Rev 2 where you could actually combo into it at the end
[0:04:21] <dds333a> @andre11dr All Guns Blazing? I always get it mixed up,with napalm death
[0:04:42] <+DigitalSoulSpark> Mornin', y'all! How we doin'?
[0:04:48] <leith_aziz> @dds333a OS has a second IK but its only in EX versiobn
[0:05:04] <andre11dr> Oh is it only EX?
[0:05:09] <dds333a> Right, but what was the name qgain?
[0:05:12] <leith_aziz> Yeah, I think so
[0:05:15] <leith_aziz> 15 October
[0:05:15] <andre11dr> I thought he just had 2
[0:05:15] <@Solidus_113> tomorrow
[0:05:20] <leith_aziz> Tommorow
[0:05:20] <%Irridium> tomorrow
[0:05:23] <Th3rd3> tomorrow
[0:05:31] <leith_aziz> There's legit footage
[0:05:32] <+noblockking> new character is end of month
[0:05:35] <leith_aziz> You can check some changes
[0:05:41] <+noblockking> system changes is tomorrow
[0:05:51] <andre11dr> So are we gonna talk about that Crowbcat video LUL
[0:05:54] <leith_aziz> nicobOof
[0:06:06] <Th3rd3> everything is against Woolie schedule, it's the lore
[0:06:08] <BlackermanZX> well you can do both StinkyGlitch
[0:06:13] <Sonny_Firestorm> Didn't Sora drop yesterday too?
[0:06:14] <%jepupu> Goldlewis being able to cancel skyfish if it whiffs sounds awesome
[0:06:19] <+Kyma1020> Everything you do is for you. No wrong answers here
[0:06:27] <+noblockking> plug one controller into 2 systems, ezpz
[0:06:28] <leith_aziz> @andre11dr Was like a trashtalking FGC poverty thing? Ehh.,...
[0:06:47] <andre11dr> ?????
[0:06:48] <dds333a> oh fuck LUL
[0:06:51] <%xeromage> boob bashers
[0:06:51] <%ekodrop> yeah can't take that away... Kappa
[0:06:58] <leith_aziz> IS it... the one fighter ABItorial did a video on?
[0:06:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:07:02] <andre11dr> I don't know what Woolie is talking about, IM HYPE
[0:07:05] <exclamatia> whens death cargo runback......
[0:07:05] <+HollowMan190> YOU HAVE TO
[0:07:26] <dds333a> @exclamatia when it gets revived Kappa
[0:07:28] <andre11dr> We need a a Dong Dong session
[0:07:33] <exclamatia> Kappa
[0:07:36] <andre11dr> Reggie needs to know
[0:07:45] <leith_aziz> Nah
[0:07:53] <leith_aziz> By this point it's kinda pointless
[0:07:55] <%kyh9> Yes
[0:07:56] <%Prevot> fuck that
[0:07:56] <Dave_VD> I’d definitely go for some dong dong
[0:07:59] <+DigitalSoulSpark> Gods, at the point we'll need robot eyes
[0:08:03] <+DigitalSoulSpark> that*
[0:08:08] <%kyh9> WOOLIE
[0:08:12] <dds333a> It'll be incremental, at least LUL
[0:08:12] <%kyh9> DO YOU REMEMBER THE 360/PS3
[0:08:16] <%kyh9> YOU THINK THAT MATTERS
[0:08:27] <%kyh9> WE'RE UPGRADING TO 8K BUT KEEPING THE 30 FPS
[0:08:27] <leith_aziz> I'm still stuck with a 144HZ 1080p monitor
[0:08:39] <@Solidus_113> 240Hz
[0:08:42] <%kyh9> "The human eye can only see 30 fps anyway"
[0:08:45] <exclamatia> honestly i was good at 1080
[0:08:55] <leith_aziz> PC player here. I dont think I can get back to 30 FPS nicobStare
[0:09:01] <%kyh9> Woolie, people have been talking about the saturation point since the PS2
[0:09:06] <@Solidus_113> 144Hz is honestly the top of the mountain, we don't need any more
[0:09:10] <andre11dr> A lot of people don't even know the difference between 30 and 60
[0:09:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> 30 and 60 for this decade are fine methinks.
[0:09:18] <+DatAsuna> res and downsampling .etc can compensate for other things like aliasing but it's fairly needless
[0:09:23] <leith_aziz> @Solidus_113 If you say so, thanks I guess
[0:09:51] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah like, what's the point of PS5 releases when next to nobody can get the damn things?
[0:10:14] <%kyh9> Just like how the PS4/Xbox One were all going to run at 60 fps
[0:10:19] <leith_aziz> If I get 60 and 1080p at LEAST, then im content
[0:10:31] <andre11dr> Consistent 60 is all i want
[0:10:32] <leith_aziz> Give me that and you're set
[0:10:34] <%kyh9> BECAUSE BETTER GRAPHICS = BETTER SCREENSHOTS = BETTER ADS
[0:11:00] <+EdenOfLove> 8k30fps future boys
[0:11:03] <%kyh9> 8K 30fps is the future.
[0:11:13] <+DatAsuna> 8k 24FPS
[0:11:20] <%Prevot> 8k 30fps with bad frame pacing
[0:11:30] <+Orcapugs> It’s like watching a game trailer just for the ad to state mobile game or VR. 😩. We still have not adapted VR.
[0:11:34] <dds333a> they are products Kappa
[0:11:37] <Dave_VD> I never give a fuzz about specs like that as long as gameplay is fun
[0:11:43] <@Solidus_113> video games will never recover from that woolieONEGUY
[0:11:53] <+DatAsuna> Movies are art, but people don't watch hollywood blockbusters thinking of them like arthouse films
[0:12:06] <leith_aziz> I've started to think about reviews less and less because there's a lot of thing I feel like will be subjective how much I like. Things that reviewers will not care about I might like a lot
[0:12:24] <%kyh9> @DatAsuna But boy do they get mad when you call the MCU films schlock/products
[0:12:26] <+DatAsuna> And yeah anyone in the press is usually gonna lean towards buyer's guide
[0:12:39] <dds333a> @leith_aziz thats why I've never cared, not even since mags LUL
[0:12:41] <JetpackMcQuack> some people just want the next madden
[0:12:42] <%ChoculaUltra> did we talk about David Jaffe absolutely getting his ass blasted by the internet for being bad at Dread then immediately implying Dread isn't a "real" MetroidVania game?
[0:12:46] <leith_aziz> Yeah. That's the game that people always ask with the price tag
[0:12:50] <+DatAsuna> Analysis is more of a youtuber 2 hour video type thing
[0:13:01] <%kyh9> $20 I think?
[0:13:03] <Zebroneath> pretty much
[0:13:04] <andre11dr> But Woolie ,all art is subjective, so why not give life of black tiger the same score as Revengece, it's all subjective Kappa
[0:13:12] <Zebroneath> $30-$40
[0:13:14] <+DatAsuna> And those don't come out at release either unless it's a small ass game
[0:13:15] <@Menitta> $30
[0:13:15] <+KaguraRaion> @kyh9 nol it was not 20 lol
[0:13:16] <Deasmeister> @leith_aziz In general I just find some reviewers whose tastes generally align with mine
[0:13:25] <leith_aziz> Now you remind me, I have a thing for watching 1 - 3 hour analyses for games. They're really fun to consume
[0:13:25] <@Menitta> it was going to be 40 on ps4/xbone
[0:13:32] <%Lion_kun> I remember Liam defending the price.
[0:13:34] <@Menitta> they then walked that back
[0:14:04] <dds333a> That's why I. didn't buy it in the first place
[0:14:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:14:05] <+DatAsuna> I played a lot of ground zeroes, but not everybody wants to do sidequests and replays, so I would always ask what they look for
[0:14:12] <leith_aziz> What about replay value?
[0:14:17] <+DatAsuna> Ground Zeroes Had a decent amount of quantity
[0:14:20] <@Solidus_113> Hollow Knight
[0:14:21] <leith_aziz> That should warrant discussion
[0:14:27] <+DatAsuna> It's problem was almost none of that was story
[0:14:34] <+DatAsuna> And most people were buying for story
[0:14:39] <%kyh9> THIS MOVIE IS ONLY 2 HOURS FOR $10???
[0:14:39] <+Beetlewins> I remember Ground Zeroes getting a lot of 'paid demo' hate
[0:14:46] <%Prevot> there's gotta be a minimum amount of quantity for stuff you're paying for, no matter the quality
[0:14:47] <KyberNasse> Goose Game
[0:14:50] <%Lion_kun> RE3make was a robbery and I don't care how much replay value they artificially added.
[0:14:52] <leith_aziz> Welcoem to Shooter and fighting games
[0:14:58] <dds333a> a long game
[0:15:03] <+DatAsuna> RE3make was both bad quality and quantity
[0:15:05] <%kyh9> I never see people talking about how big the canvas is of a painting when talking about its value
[0:15:05] <Zebroneath> $15-$20
[0:15:08] <@Menitta> Replay value is also intrinsic
[0:15:08] <leith_aziz> People'll play Titanfall 2 singleplayer then move on
[0:15:12] <andre11dr> Hollow Knight is infinite bang for your buck
[0:15:16] <Kristoffers> The Neverending Knight more like
[0:15:21] <+DatAsuna> Force Unleashed 2 however was worth it just for the "THEY ARE REAL TO ME" meme
[0:15:21] <shieldanvil> i thought everyone got the dlc for free
[0:15:24] <leith_aziz> Whoa
[0:15:27] <srv4254> 15 for a game better than most triple a 60+
[0:15:32] <leith_aziz> nicobD
[0:15:34] <@Solidus_113> all the DLC was just free updates
[0:15:36] <%ChoculaUltra> then there's PT, an actual demo that people are willing to drop hundreds, almost thousands now, just to play it LUL
[0:15:42] <dds333a> extremely
[0:15:44] <Archmortal> Hollow Knight is the best fucking shit ever
[0:15:49] <leith_aziz> I might need to check out Hollow Knight
[0:15:51] <dds333a> I think the game is great
[0:16:05] <%ekodrop> it's way too long imo
[0:16:12] <leith_aziz> Do you think its too long in the sense that there's a goal that you feel you never reach?
[0:16:13] <Kristoffers> Okami ends 3 times baby
[0:16:18] <Dave_VD> Damn I own hollow Knight but I never get past the mage dude in the city area. I gotta give it another go
[0:16:22] <Summerteeth> I love the length of Okami, it's epic man
[0:16:24] <@Solidus_113> Okami 2 is the best of the trilogy
[0:16:25] <Wahrow> Yeah, Okami is a bit long
[0:16:25] <leith_aziz> Pacing issues are common in games sadly
[0:16:41] <%kyh9> Brawl was BEEG
[0:16:41] <BlackermanZX> you get a free okami 2
[0:16:42] <+devilishleader> it's fine I treat as 3 games
[0:16:50] <drunken_lemur> Better to get Okami 2 and 3 in one game than to never get them at all.
[0:16:52] <dds333a> Indeed
[0:16:52] <Kristoffers> the subspace emissary takes a while
[0:17:05] <%kyh9> Subspace was nutty, the mini-games were nutty
[0:17:07] <@Menitta> then Ultra was like "no wait theres 12"
[0:17:12] <leith_aziz> Shadow Of War is a recent example I can think of. We didnt need that final act
[0:17:17] <dds333a> Helper Arena boils my blood to this day
[0:17:34] <WeijiBeng> hey chat
[0:17:44] <%kyh9> METROID IS $60?!?!?!  WHAT A RIP OFF
[0:17:47] <leith_aziz> The Witcher 3 is a game I love for being long with content. And then the DLC adds even more nicobDesire
[0:17:49] <andre11dr> Some games are made for people with a lot of free time
[0:17:55] <leith_aziz> It's deffinitely the other side of the spectrum
[0:17:55] <+DatAsuna> It's just a matter of there being multiple audiences and needing mutliple review types for each
[0:17:58] <%kyh9> "Nintendo $60 vs Sony $60" and all that shit
[0:18:12] <Deasmeister> But then you have Ubisoft games clear these bandit camps forever no thanks
[0:18:17] <leith_aziz> That's the argument that comes to shooter and fighting games
[0:18:19] <@Menitta> also the time at the end is not accurate because it doesnt count death time
[0:18:20] <%ChoculaUltra> so by that logic, all roguelike games or games designed for multiple runs should be valued higher than 60 dollars. I hate people.
[0:18:29] <@Solidus_113> No Man's Sky is still $60
[0:18:30] <leith_aziz> Same content with infinite amount of replay value
[0:18:31] <%kyh9> 6/10 for Godhand
[0:18:34] <+DatAsuna> This is why you have to find specific reviewers you know, so you know the lens they're using is the one relevant to you
[0:18:37] <%kyh9> REPLAY VALUE
[0:18:41] <%kyh9> LMAO
[0:18:46] <+DatAsuna> Rather than an outlet with writers you don't know
[0:18:49] <%kyh9> WHERES MY RE-WATCH VALUE FOR LIGHTHOUSE
[0:18:54] <%kyh9> NYTIMES YOU HACKS
[0:18:55] <WeijiBeng> jim sterling always be ranting about replay value
[0:19:03] <Sonny_Firestorm> NG+ 12
[0:19:07] <leith_aziz> Ubisoft are awful at doing replay value and lengthening the runtime
[0:19:08] <BlackermanZX> that score is bs
[0:19:10] <%livlinn> LUL
[0:19:11] <leith_aziz> *padding
[0:19:11] <@Menitta> whenever you see those takes, be it price comparisons or god of war trees, just fucking block
[0:19:27] <%ChoculaUltra> what if I beat a game 10 years ago, decide to play it again - do I factor that into "replay value"????
[0:19:27] <andre11dr> That's the thing, if a game is long as fuck, it better have a lot of variety
[0:19:31] <JetpackMcQuack> the artsy stuff is for the award shows
[0:19:37] <+DatAsuna> @leith_aziz God all 3 of the last asscreed games kept going dozens of hours longer than I wanted
[0:19:41] <%Lion_kun> Metal Gear Rising.
[0:19:43] <WeijiBeng> Wont even touch that shit @Menitta LUL
[0:19:59] <andre11dr> Disco Elysium get a 10/10 on the Replay Value scale
[0:20:13] <+DatAsuna> Product reviews also tend to be woefully inaddequate at staying up to date on live service games
[0:20:15] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp everybody's different
[0:20:15] <%Am_Shigar00> I’ve definitely tried to replay games with new game+ that are NOT fun to replay since it’s inherently repetitive.
[0:20:20] <%kyh9> Does it expand your soul?
[0:20:22] <leith_aziz> @leith_aziz Yeah, I was fatigued by AC after Rogue and Syndicate. Ezio trilogy is still great though
[0:20:33] <Kristoffers> as a "reviewer", taking price into account seems strange 'cause it changes so much over time
[0:20:36] <+DatAsuna> So anything that tells a story over a long period of time gets overlooked by your igns .etc
[0:20:45] <%kyh9> But it's $2 now, is it good?
[0:20:45] <%Prevot> I ain't got no money to waste, price is HIGHLY important
[0:20:50] <BlackermanZX> recently i played Gunvolt Avenger IX and had a blast and that game is really short with little replay value
[0:20:54] <+DeaneFox> one of my favorite genres is arcade shmups which you generally can "finish" in literally 30 minutes on average, but replaying, improving score, and chasing leaderboards adds a ton of gameplay value
[0:20:59] <@Menitta> Because it now costs $200 to buy a copy of Chibi Robo
[0:21:05] <andre11dr> I think Ground Zeros had enough content for it to be worth
[0:21:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:06] <@Menitta> is that worth $200
[0:21:14] <@Solidus_113> I've seen MGS5 Definitive go down to like $8
[0:21:16] <+DatAsuna> Yeah, those reviews are made to be read at launch and never again
[0:21:18] <dds333a> @deanefox I hear that
[0:21:30] <%Lion_kun> Don't buy it out of spite at their audacity.
[0:21:32] <%ChoculaUltra> the only series I will call out for charging 60 is probably Pokemon nowadays. Only pokemon could get away with decades of plateauing.
[0:21:34] <%Am_Shigar00> I’ve put like 80+ hours into both Bayos and W101 since those games have lots to do with scores and secrets despite the short campaigns.
[0:21:35] <%Lion_kun> Never forget.
[0:21:40] <OblivionSword1> SEA price for games used to be ridiculous as well
[0:21:42] <andre11dr> It's when it a 2 hour story game with not much variety where i would spend money
[0:21:46] <leith_aziz> That's deffinitely an issue when it coems to FG's with all of the DLC (before you get the ultimate version)
[0:21:50] <lonosis47> Theyre still talking???
[0:21:57] <leith_aziz> Early SF games had that problem with different ports
[0:22:10] <@Menitta> Bright Memory is $10 and less than an hour long and wasnt worth it.
[0:22:11] <Kristoffers> Granblue coming out in europe with dlc chars already out was something lol
[0:22:18] <+DatAsuna> I do hate that nintendo evergreen pricing
[0:22:23] <%ChoculaUltra> lets not forget Capcom and the SF4 era of actual on-disk dlc. Fuck that entire period of gaming.
[0:22:25] <leith_aziz> OOF nicobSad
[0:22:27] <+DatAsuna> Titanfall 1 had that way more
[0:22:35] <@Solidus_113> it's literally in dollar stores LUL
[0:22:43] <%jinking79> with all DLC
[0:22:44] <%Am_Shigar00> Poor titanfall
[0:22:48] <leith_aziz> I need to play Titanfall 2 on PC one day
[0:22:49] <BlackermanZX> that gives me one guy vibes
[0:22:51] <WeijiBeng> is mvci worth 5 bucks on microsoft pass
[0:22:54] <leith_aziz> That game was way too fun
[0:23:04] <dds333a> @weijibeng never
[0:23:08] <+Beetlewins> Titanfall 2 was so fucking good
[0:23:08] <@Solidus_113> content
[0:23:17] <leith_aziz> nicobPalm
[0:23:18] <%LastHazzerd> cost IS a factor, cuz you said yourself that sales affect it
[0:23:21] <dds333a> rvery time LUL
[0:23:24] <%Javaa01> Problem is, in a world of patching, how do you review a game "for good"
[0:23:30] <%DashXero> Got 'im.
[0:23:34] <exclamatia> ITS TIME TO SUMMON SLIME
[0:23:34] <+Beetlewins> Protocol 3: Protect the Pilot
[0:23:40] <leith_aziz> @Javaa01 Are Review updates not a thing to consider
[0:23:40] <Dave_VD> Makes me so upset that titanfall 2 never got an esports scene and is just dead now. No FPS has come close to being so sick
[0:23:42] <+KaguraRaion> @lonosis47 You dont have to sit here and listen....
[0:23:43] <%ChoculaUltra> its 2021, if your game isn't ready at launch just say its early access and keep it the fuck moving.
[0:23:53] <%kyh9> @Javaa01 Give a final verdict, and then say what price you think it's worth purchasing at.  Two review scores
[0:24:02] <%Javaa01> @Javaa01 Not when they happen once in a blue moon
[0:24:04] <%LastHazzerd> this the last stream of SMT
[0:24:15] <%Am_Shigar00> What a ride this game has been

[0:29:27] <turboyabo> simple attack animations good animation
[0:29:29] <dds333a> @kyh9 Gashadokuri is mythological but I def know what you mean LUL

[0:30:25] <dds333a> you can see it too
[0:30:43] <drunken_lemur> Balder.
[0:30:44] <JetpackMcQuack> acjilles had a weakness named after him
[0:30:45] <Qu1ckyyy> But your back being weak means you mustn't be a coward
[0:30:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Siegfried has it better since his weakness is less famous.
[0:30:49] <linSP> it’s like baldur dying to mistletoe
[0:30:50] <+Kyma1020> basically German Achilles
[0:30:52] <+DatAsuna> It was his heel, not his ankle
[0:31:00] <dds333a> Fafnir had a weak spot too LUL
[0:31:02] <+DatAsuna> But being hit from behind is bad in general
[0:31:07] <drunken_lemur> @linSP Well that's ONE thing.
[0:31:09] <turboyabo> and fafnir is a dude who turns into dragon because of greed
[0:31:12] <%ChoculaUltra> didn't his wife end up killing Siegfried? I'm bad with Norse lore
[0:31:14] <+DatAsuna> Most people's backs are their weakpoints
[0:31:22] <+vaporousTippler> Also nuked Japan.
[0:31:27] <dds333a> eight steps
[0:31:27] <andre11dr> Achilless story is so dumb, why didn't his mom just dip the toe as well LUL
[0:31:29] <%jinking79> Saint Seiya knew
[0:31:42] <%fetrigon> KomodoHype <3
[0:31:44] <linSP> fat thor is sick!
[0:31:48] <+LandOfTheWay> lilith my love
[0:31:52] <Sonny_Firestorm> tl;dr she a thoh
[0:31:55] <kingra> Lilith is NOT a bitch
[0:31:55] <%Prevot> these demons ain't loyal
[0:32:02] <%Am_Shigar00> Still using that updated smt1 design
[0:32:03] <dds333a> God doesn't allow thotting
[0:32:05] <%ChoculaUltra> @andre11dr "You get one dip and one dip only, no do overs" - Guy who ran the River Styx, probably
[0:32:06] <+Kyma1020> Thanks God
[0:32:06] <%BisoromiBear> she was on the corner
[0:32:19] <kingra> God HATES freedom
[0:32:20] <KyberNasse> Singles begone
[0:32:26] <%DashXero> For the non-existent streets.
[0:32:48] <Sonny_Firestorm> @kingra and that's why we reject God (once more)
[0:33:06] <andre11dr> @choculaultra Ok ,do just grab the other foot and spin him around before pulling him out
[0:33:08] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> @ChoculaUltra That, and if she let go of Achilles at all, the current of the river would've taken him. So the heel was the only way.
[0:33:13] <turboyabo> she banged her nephu...no wait her son? now we got vampires
[0:33:25] <%ChoculaUltra> oh right, rivers actually move and shit LUL
[0:33:44] <dds333a> @turboyabo Cain had to go LUL
[0:34:16] <turboyabo> cain a sick looking persona tho
[0:34:25] <Sonny_Firestorm> Expanse Exploration be like that
[0:34:46] <dds333a> @sonny_firestorm not the Expanse in this case tho LUL
[0:35:12] <andre11dr> But what if one of the operators just fucking passes out, everyone dying
[0:35:12] <%ChoculaUltra> always joked about how much status Cain has but never really gets credit for - like imagine being credited as the first ever murderer LUL
[0:35:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:35:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> Expanse by another name.
[0:35:54] <Sonny_Firestorm> This is like Digimon World 1 if you could fight alongside yer Digimon, man I wish they'd remaster these games already.
[0:36:01] <dds333a> @sonny_firestorm the Expanse is home to demons ever since MT. the Akarana Corridor is very different LUL
[0:36:10] <turboyabo> actually i have no idea if that one persona anime about cain ,able , and the third brother. kf its good or not
[0:36:21] <+DatAsuna> @Sonny_Firestorm I could go for a digimon world 3 remaster too tho
[0:36:24] <andre11dr> To be fair Lilith is kinda of a bitch for creating a bunch of demons just because she was salty God ghosted her
[0:36:34] <+DatAsuna> That said atlus remasters have been kinda poopy lately
[0:36:40] <+DatAsuna> Do not buy nocturne on switch
[0:36:41] <dds333a> @andre11dr LUL LUL SeemsGood
[0:36:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> @dds333a semi-optional, realm-between, random elements, sounds like an Expanse to me
[0:36:48] <%ChoculaUltra> I mean to be fair - imagine being ghosted by an omniscient creator? You must've REALLY fucked that up lmfao
[0:36:54] <+DatAsuna> Unless you like PS2 games running at sub 10 FPS on your switch
[0:37:28] <Sonny_Firestorm> @DatAsuna That's cause for the most part it's Sega Dinos ordering them.
[0:37:31] <dds333a> @sonny_firestorm it's not optional at all, also it's a time stream, not an alternate dimension LUL
[0:37:43] <Sonny_Firestorm> Tometo tomato.
[0:37:50] <%ChoculaUltra> bro don't even buy Nocturne on PC. I'm baffled how they just didn't seemingly bother to remaster any of the soundtrack???
[0:37:51] <+DatAsuna> @Sonny_Firestorm Nah man, Atlus have been dinos about technical stuff forever, long before Sega.
[0:37:54] <dds333a> It connects to other universe, whereas the Expanse doesn't
[0:38:17] <Sonny_Firestorm> But they had the excuse of being small, now that they're a Sega subsidiary that excuse doesn't hold anymore.
[0:38:34] <+DatAsuna> Sega has a way better track record on port quality too recently
[0:38:40] <dds333a> Stone time
[0:39:12] <+DatAsuna> Whereas atlus tend to kind of just not bother optimising, if they port it at all
[0:39:33] <+DatAsuna> That said, I would still want some Raidou/digital devil survivor remasters.
[0:39:41] <+DatAsuna> Just at a higher standard than nocturne got
[0:40:09] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda shocked Atlus didn't shit out a PS5 P5Royal remaster/port or whatever with like 5% extra content tbh
[0:40:24] <+DatAsuna> Atlus hates money
[0:40:34] <dds333a> @choculaultra LUL LUL
[0:40:42] <+DatAsuna> P5 switch never
[0:40:44] <+DatAsuna> P5 PC never
[0:40:50] <%ChoculaUltra> sometimes I think they're too greedy but sometimes it's like "bro you left your wallet on the table" as they walk away LUL
[0:41:24] <andre11dr> @datasuna Blame the heads of Atllus for being dinosaurs
[0:41:27] <%ChoculaUltra> how tf is P5 Strikers on the Switch but regular P5 isn't?! How!
[0:41:32] <+DatAsuna> They don't want the easy money of a switch/steam port but they WILL stick their hands out for more DLC money on royal
[0:42:34] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:42:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:42:49] <%LastHazzerd> wow... Louis Armstrong...
[0:43:00] <%DashXero> Lotta good music from the 60's.
[0:43:12] <BlackermanZX> so broke cant heal
[0:43:24] <+DatAsuna> But yeah, this stuff here makes it way more fitting for Radiou to be the Nocturne cameo than Dante.
[0:43:28] <dds333a> Let's go Kappa
[0:43:36] <%DashXero> Reagan? NotLikeThis
[0:43:38] <alroy909> the good times...
[0:43:41] <%BisoromiBear> yeyeye crack get hype
[0:43:47] <+DatAsuna> Raidou also actually gets an ending unlike Dante
[0:43:55] <%Prevot> where's the mullet demon
[0:44:00] <Joestar1890> This IS 80's Japan though, so they get the whole economic bubble thing
[0:44:09] <OblivionSword1> @ChoculaUltra probably because of omega force
[0:44:32] <+disgorgex23> cum
[0:44:33] <%Am_Shigar00> @choculaultra P5 strikers is made in the musou engine that they used for HW and FEW, it was likely already set to easily port over.
[0:44:40] <exclamatia> remembers reagan is fucking dead GayPride GayPride GayPride
[0:44:41] <dds333a> indeed it is
[0:44:54] <andre11dr> I like how the 60s and 70s are the little leagues to Woolie LUL
[0:44:55] <%ChoculaUltra> @Am_Shigar00 ah that makes sense
[0:44:56] <+DatAsuna> @ChoculaUltra Yeah, koei doesn't do great pc ports but at least they do it
[0:44:59] <dds333a> who uses summoning rituals anymore?
[0:45:08] <KyberNasse> BACK IN MY DAY
[0:45:21] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[0:45:24] <Joestar1890> The Program was made in the 80's by Not Steven Hawking
[0:45:30] <%LastHazzerd> i can't drive places without GPS
[0:45:46] <+LandOfTheWay> they joke about that in soul hackers too, when raidou and raido appear as bonus bosses
[0:45:48] <+vaderxyz1970> You mean SSD
[0:46:00] <dds333a> @joestar1890 *90s, yeah. but the origianl program was made by a high schooler in the 80s
[0:46:17] <+DatAsuna> Reggie going full MGS2
[0:46:19] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:46:45] <+DatAsuna> That's what I like
[0:46:57] <%KetsuoTaberu> wtf is this English
[0:47:05] <%DashXero> Was anyone talking like that in any time period?
[0:47:08] <%Am_Shigar00> Future slaaaang
[0:47:26] <+LandOfTheWay> 80s slang just sounds that way to our 20s boy raidou
[0:47:26] <%hologram_sam> Stranger in a Strange Land ref.
[0:47:27] <Joestar1890> @dds333a Steven stole the research from a Akemi? I thought Akemi based his program off of Steven.
[0:47:28] <%BisoromiBear> hepton fellow slider
[0:47:35] <dds333a> @dashxero nah, these are tourists from the future
[0:47:35] <%Prevot> schway
[0:47:45] <%DashXero> Ah. Thanks @dds333a .
[0:47:51] <andre11dr> Oh ,that's Berlin
[0:47:52] <+DatAsuna> the yakisoba pan will help you process it
[0:47:58] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that's easy - time traveling Kanye
[0:48:13] <dds333a> @joestar1890 Nakajima built it first pretty sure
[0:48:34] <andre11dr> My mother Grandpa was there, he actually saw the wall when it was up
[0:48:40] <+DatAsuna> Speaking of steven, smt4 apocalypse kinda sucks, but that steven dlc is fire
[0:48:58] <%Am_Shigar00> I loved Apocalypse, it’s story is dumb but that gameplay is fantastic.
[0:48:59] <dds333a> @dashxero np
[0:49:29] <+DatAsuna> apocalypse has a lot of cool ideas it doesn't do justice
[0:49:32] <Blank9> man the story is fine too
[0:49:38] <Blank9> gaston is the coolest
[0:49:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:49:49] <BlackermanZX> RUN BOY
[0:49:50] <Jaxnos> that boy a sneakin
[0:49:51] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:49:56] <dds333a> LUL
[0:50:02] <+DatAsuna> And to a certain extent I feel like every SMT touches on topics it can't  fully explore, apocalypse barely even bothers having character arcs
[0:50:19] <Jaxnos> is Thoth your Abu? LUL
[0:50:32] <%ChoculaUltra> amazingly terrifying
[0:50:37] <dds333a> Sounds like a trip
[0:50:39] <Joestar1890> @dds333a Wiki seems to imply that they developed the program independently. And that's if they're in the same universe.
[0:50:40] <%DashXero> Jesus.
[0:50:50] <moonmintparadise> Yeah 100% an accident on the autobahn is fatal
[0:50:55] <cj_art> monkaS
[0:51:17] <%DashXero> Can't have that shit in America.
[0:51:21] <moonmintparadise> Here in Germany they are trying to push for speed limits because of the fatality of the autobahn actually haha
[0:51:22] <%ChoculaUltra> it would be rad af tho
[0:51:25] <dds333a> @joestar1890 makes sense, and they assuredly do. that's why I went with Nakajima since the character precedes Steven
[0:51:34] <Make_me_mad> Just set up an autobahn in every country and use it to weed dumbasses out of the population gradually.
[0:51:40] <+Kyma1020> Tell that to Floridians
[0:51:42] <%ChoculaUltra> I think of the autobahn as like that one post-game dungeon but for drivers
[0:51:49] <+PMAvers> But what if we had people going infinity speed if they want, but the road was a loop. And then they  had races on them and they were televised.
[0:51:56] <+LandOfTheWay> SMT1 REFERENCE
[0:52:00] <Qu1ckyyy> Yooo SMT1
[0:52:00] <dds333a> Big bomb drop bith figuraitvelly and literall

[0:52:26] <+Kyma1020> Smt 1 Reggie
[0:52:28] <exclamatia> thie game... takes place before smt1 owo
[0:52:30] <Joestar1890> AMBASSADOR "two nukes weren't enough" THORMAN
[0:52:31] <%Am_Shigar00> Nukes
[0:52:35] <Qu1ckyyy> What did I miss my internet shut down
[0:52:36] <%Prevot> hasn't happened... YET
[0:52:44] <dds333a> @ixdomxi we'll get there LUL
[0:52:54] <+DatAsuna> When it's not nukes, it's conception or just god saying fuck it
[0:52:56] <dds333a> Imminent Great Cataclysm
[0:53:01] <andre11dr> Damn ,does that mean that in this universe 90s music doesn't get to exist?
[0:53:08] <andre11dr> That sucks
[0:53:13] <jman13131313> yet
[0:53:18] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr might get to exist for a few years
[0:53:22] <Jaxnos> as Stephen Hawking would do
[0:53:25] <drunken_lemur> Computer Program!
[0:53:30] <%Prevot> GGs stephen
[0:53:30] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh Stephen
[0:53:39] <OblivionSword1> not even phone through old school laptops
[0:53:39] <drunken_lemur> It wasn't an App
[0:53:52] <dds333a> And then a portal to the Expanse hastens it to due to portal experiments
[0:53:58] <Qu1ckyyy> THORman
[0:54:04] <%ChoculaUltra> was it on purpose or did Not Stephen Hawking do it by accident
[0:54:05] <%Am_Shigar00> Good ol’ Thorman
[0:54:11] <%townzzzzz> Thor godman
[0:54:14] <dds333a> not actually based on Truman by the way LUL
[0:54:14] <+Bosni9> Bosni9 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Thorman
[0:54:18] <Joestar1890> @andre11dr At least up to 1992
[0:54:22] <%DashXero> Yay.
[0:54:25] <Blank9> US ambassador thorman launching the HAMMER OF THOR aka nukes
[0:54:29] <%ChoculaUltra> "I kinda wanna start a new file." - God, SMT
[0:54:35] <+IxDomxI> attack and dethrone god.
[0:54:35] <Joestar1890> Using Nukes for some reason. Poetic Irony I guess
[0:54:44] <+DatAsuna> You fight him a lot
[0:54:44] <dds333a> No, that's not actually what he wants. and Yhvh is actually not involved in SMT I LUL
[0:54:45] <Sonny_Firestorm> Through the course of SMT1 Tokyo gets destroyed twice. Once by ICBM and another by flood.
[0:54:47] <Qu1ckyyy> Not Japan, HUMANITY all of it
[0:54:49] <Jaxnos> this would've been a great series for baby Woolie to play
[0:54:50] <KyberNasse> yhwh more like nahwah
[0:54:54] <Blank9> YHVH is the final boss a couple times
[0:54:57] <+LandOfTheWay> stephen sent the demon summoning program out to random people on purpose, because demons were already appearing and he anticipated that devil summoners would be needed
[0:55:01] <%Am_Shigar00> Japan has it rough in SMT1
[0:55:03] <dds333a> He is a fuck in SMT II tho
[0:55:04] <Sonny_Firestorm> @Qu1ckyyy It's only japan.
[0:55:05] <+Kyma1020> yeah the Abrahamic gods are a bunch of stiffs
[0:55:13] <%cisealnine> cisealnine subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! After seeing that you were playing Dokapon Journey yesterday, but not being able to watch, it is nice to see that Reggie is still alive.
[0:55:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> Japan-centric game design.
[0:55:17] <%LastHazzerd> or when a cheeky avatar/human decides to be the next creator
[0:55:25] <Qu1ckyyy> @son
[0:55:28] <%ChoculaUltra> as an SMT noob - has Jesus been in an SMT or Persona game yet?
[0:55:32] <+DatAsuna> The relevant timeline is that SMT2 leads into Raidou, who lead sinto If that leads into Persona
[0:55:35] <Qu1ckyyy> @Sonny_Firestorm everything died
[0:55:36] <dds333a> ehich results in worldwide nuclear apocalypse
[0:55:45] <andre11dr> But the Great Will goes " Yeah I'm not letting YHVH do this shit" and choses a couple of people to survive the attack
[0:55:45] <+DatAsuna> @ChoculaUltra No, but the spear of longinus has
[0:55:46] <Joestar1890> @ChoculaUltra Technically PErsona 3 as "Messiah". But he
[0:55:47] <+LandOfTheWay> @ChoculaUltra yes
[0:55:50] <dds333a> @choculaultra yes, Agony Kappa
[0:56:02] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL loving the mixed responses
[0:56:05] <teefpal> @ChoculaUltra He's implied to exist and refered to as a Messiah, but nothing specific
[0:56:06] <%Am_Shigar00> They even let you walk around a bit after the nukes launched, unable to escape or prevent the nukes from preventing the assault.
[0:56:06] <Joestar1890> But he's just a archetype and not Jesus himself
[0:56:08] <+DatAsuna> Hitler in P2 has the spear that stabbed christ
[0:56:21] <andre11dr> In Nocturne the apocalypse just kinda happens
[0:56:34] <andre11dr> And your chosen to survive
[0:56:39] <dds333a> as mentioned before, SMT IV has massive references to SMT I and II
[0:56:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[0:56:45] <+LandOfTheWay> @ChoculaUltra there is a persona in p3 called Messiah that is inspired by jesus, and there's a demon in Devil Summoner called Agony that is just jesus carrying the cross
[0:56:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> The worst part of the nukes is that the Heroine died saving your sorry arse. FeelsBadMan
[0:56:55] <Make_me_mad> I love the way the apocalypse happens in Nocturne. The idea that any small-time cult could do a ritual and end the world is nuts.
[0:56:59] <YaminoRaiden> Isn't there some debate wether or not YHWH in SMT is even actually God or just another one of the Demons in the series that has taken on the highest conceptual form that they can?
[0:57:05] <+DatAsuna> But also P2 just straight name drops jesus
[0:57:12] <%Am_Shigar00> SMTiv really felt like a modern alternate take on I for better or wose.
[0:57:15] <Qu1ckyyy> @dds333a And SJ with the Demonicas
[0:57:28] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy exactly
[0:57:28] <+vaderxyz1970> @kyma1020 That phrase makes me laugh
[0:57:41] <@Solidus_113> I wish I could play SMT4 on literally anything other than 3DS
[0:57:43] <+LandOfTheWay> @YaminoRaiden not really a debate, all demons up to and including yhvh are intrinsically the same thing just with different power levels
[0:57:44] <Sonny_Firestorm> @YaminoRaiden No, we know for a fact there is one above YHWH. We just don't talk about it very often not to upset the christians.
[0:57:47] <dds333a> @yaminoraiden indeed
[0:57:59] <andre11dr> @yaminoraiden Well he is God ,but in this universe God was also created by something
[0:58:06] <andre11dr> The Great Will
[0:58:17] <dds333a> @make_me_mad one man, in fact LUL
[0:58:25] <Joestar1890> @YaminoRaiden Kinda too late for that considering his portrayal in the games LUL
[0:58:26] <andre11dr> That's like the actual creator of everything
[0:58:43] <+blankwaffle> !uptime
[0:58:43] <@Moobot> @blankwaffle WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 30 minutes
[0:58:46] <Sonny_Firestorm> Also, YHVH's got nothing on Steven. Kappa
[0:59:03] <Jaxnos> ayo
[0:59:11] <dds333a> Vade= leave
[0:59:16] <+DatAsuna> @Sonny_Firestorm he does fight all the protagonists at once, so yeah
[0:59:18] <%Am_Shigar00> I still haven’t beaten stephen in IVA. He practically oneshot my party once i hot phase 2.
[0:59:37] <@Solidus_113> vade/fade/obsolete
[0:59:37] <%Am_Shigar00> I should do that at some point.
[0:59:49] <Sonny_Firestorm> The Thousand Year Kingdom
[0:59:58] <dds333a> good ol Cathedral/Basilica
[0:59:59] <Blank9> old neutral is a lot less feel-good, just kill everyone
[1:00:14] <+LandOfTheWay> the great will's not really a creator as much as the idea of "god" as the totality of existence. similar to the concept behind brahman from hinduism (tho there is also a lesser deity by that name in at least one timeline)
[1:00:19] <dds333a> Nah, they could be worse Kappa

[1:00:36] <exclamatia> 90s into the 2020s fucking sucks in OUR world but better than nuclear apocalypse ig
[1:00:43] <+LandOfTheWay> it's implied humanity also made the great will like they made all other demons
[1:00:50] <+LandOfTheWay> it's just on a totally different level
[1:00:54] <teefpal> More like 2001 to the modern day
[1:01:03] <Qu1ckyyy> Nah you were pretty correct
[1:01:09] <dds333a> nah, you got most of it Kappa
[1:01:09] <+LandOfTheWay> @WoolieVersus you got it mostly correct, yeah
[1:01:23] <%Am_Shigar00> You got the jist of it @woolieversus
[1:01:33] <andre11dr> But dosen't Raidou just kinda gets to dodge all the apocalypse shit ,because he's off to Soul Hackers when that happens?
[1:01:34] <dds333a> There's just A TON. between the lines LUL
[1:01:36] <+vaderxyz1970> SMT just sucks for normal people who don't summon demons
[1:01:50] <dds333a> @andre11dr we'll get to that LUL
[1:02:04] <exclamatia> raidou like "jump around jump around now"
[1:02:07] <Sonny_Firestorm> Hey mods, I wanna share a video link, can someone help me?
[1:02:11] <%Am_Shigar00> SMT lore is confusing and SMTI and II are pretty obscure as far as those who’ve actually played it, so things are easy to get lost
[1:02:24] <exclamatia> smt1+2 remake when...
[1:02:46] <Sonny_Firestorm> SMT1's localization KEKW
[1:02:47] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 it gets worse when people try to shove them all into one timeline LUL
[1:03:02] <dds333a> They're mostly completely disconnected
[1:03:04] <+DatAsuna> @andre11dr yes and no, multiverse shit means he both does and doesn't avoid it. lol
[1:03:35] <%Am_Shigar00> @dds333a yeah, there’s really only a handful of games that are directly connected at best
[1:03:37] <Qu1ckyyy> @dds333a You can use Raidou 1 to connect a lot of them, but yeah Nocturne shows how disconnected al of them are
[1:04:02] <exclamatia> ONE timeline is impossivle bc multiverse alt history jumping around, but they can all -connect- in odd ways
[1:04:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:04:18] <Qu1ckyyy> oh they fucking
[1:04:20] <%BisoromiBear> get the man poison out
[1:04:26] <+DatAsuna> They mostly all just diverge from one change to the main timeline
[1:04:28] <Dopamien> WutFace
[1:04:31] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy exactly, especially since the amala Network was co-optes by fans for a multiverse, when it's not at all relevant or even mentioned in other games
[1:04:33] <Jaxnos> they bangin?
[1:04:33] <%DashXero> Thor with the epic HJs
[1:04:34] <+the_420_dachshund> thorn with the nose candy
[1:04:34] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:04:38] <YaminoRaiden> Crossdresser Thor at it again
[1:04:39] <+DatAsuna> stuff like thorman having a heart attack .etc
[1:04:39] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:04:45] <+PMAvers> As he do.
[1:04:50] <OblivionSword1> as he would do
[1:04:54] <%LastHazzerd> on brand
[1:04:56] <+LandOfTheWay> you can make a direct connection for at least 2 smt timelines splitting from raidou here, but yeah they're otherwise disconnected
[1:04:56] <%Prevot> ANOTHER!
[1:04:57] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> This god is just Yujiro Hanma.
[1:05:06] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> All men are women to him.
[1:05:08] <KyberNasse> Like father like son
[1:05:09] <%DashXero> He handles Mjolnir all the time. He's gotta know a thing or two.
[1:05:21] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:05:22] <Sonny_Firestorm> @WoolieVersus Kaneko confirmed that Pixie (and most demons) know what Sex is.
[1:05:22] <%king_wragles> "what that hammer do?"
[1:05:23] <Joestar1890> The hammer pulls him off?
[1:05:24] <Jaxnos> something something hammering
[1:05:25] <%Am_Shigar00> Pfftt
[1:05:25] <%xeromage> Seems like Lilith should have been the one for this challenge
[1:05:25] <drunken_lemur> Thor IS the God of Fertility
[1:05:42] <BlackermanZX> the hammer stays on during sex
[1:05:45] <dds333a> @sonny_firestorm of course, they mention it LUL
[1:06:09] <exclamatia> i really gotta play smt3 sometime but im so broke ajdhsgsg
[1:06:13] <YaminoRaiden> Scahah
[1:06:13] <exclamatia> and ps2 emu hard
[1:06:20] <+LandOfTheWay> loved seeing cu and scathach in the raidou manga
[1:06:21] <dds333a> @datasuna yeah, somewhat
[1:06:22] <Sonny_Firestorm> Nono, I mean the guy who designed all dem demons. It's word of meta-god.
[1:06:32] <Qu1ckyyy> Rakshasa carrying Raidou ever since his car left im
[1:06:41] <Sonny_Firestorm> Anyway, can I post a youtube link here?
[1:06:47] <dds333a> @sonny_firestorm I know, I'm agreeing with you LUL the demons mention it too LUL
[1:06:49] <%Am_Shigar00> I wonder what that car’s up to these days
[1:07:39] <exclamatia> car got fused right? hes still around in one of these demons somewhere
[1:08:37] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Sonny_Firestorm
[1:08:50] <Sonny_Firestorm> Ok, so no.
[1:08:56] <dds333a> using that mp LUL
[1:10:20] <%Am_Shigar00> I’m really glad they reworked bullets in raidou 2. Made them a much more consistent part of my moveset compared to 1, even you don’t get quite the on the fly element changes
[1:10:37] <dds333a> Thor always on top Kappa
[1:10:55] <+the_420_dachshund> what are you doing step-hammer
[1:11:02] <+vaporousTippler> I mean, Thor fucked Japan pretty good.

[1:17:29] <KyberNasse> Is Rasputin Pelinal Whitestrake?
[1:17:42] <drunken_lemur> @BlackermanZX So if the T-800 had Arnold's ACTUAL personality.
[1:18:11] <andre11dr> Question, is this game the only time Rasputin appears?
[1:18:23] <dds333a> @andre11dr as a character yeah
[1:18:34] <dds333a> Rasputin also just a demon in P2
[1:18:56] <vapelad_dabberb01> rasputin's in raidou 2 as well
[1:19:00] <%KetsuoTaberu> accurate
[1:19:01] <%Am_Shigar00> Appearently he cameos in the Raidou manga, though I don’t remember seeing him myself.

[1:34:18] <%LastHazzerd> oh, is this SMT II thing?
[1:34:28] <+Kyma1020> 07 Ps3
[1:34:28] <Blank9> nope, not related to any game
[1:34:32] <X2Eliah> @Qu1ckyyy way after this one
[1:34:33] <OblivionSword1> AC 1 came out on the ps3/360 era
[1:34:40] <Blank9> or at least not any other game
[1:34:45] <dds333a> @lasthazzerd relevant to a very relevant character LUL Kappa
[1:34:45] <%LastHazzerd> @OblivionSword1 well this IS time travel
[1:34:56] <%LastHazzerd> @dds333a oh...
[1:34:59] <+Kyma1020> that thread will be relevant in a few moments if they get to it
[1:35:10] <exclamatia> soon we will see
[1:35:11] <dds333a> @kyma1020 exactly
[1:35:12] <exclamatia> The Truth
[1:35:33] <@Solidus_113> I wonder if people who made games about future tech 20-30 years ago are disappointed by our real future
[1:35:59] <+DatAsuna> something something "hoverboards caught on fire"
[1:36:03] <%Am_Shigar00> Fictional futures are always way cooler (or depressing) than whatever future we actually get
[1:36:12] <dds333a> @solidus_113 I wonder too LUL
[1:36:19] <+DatAsuna> @Am_Shigar00 often both
[1:36:24] <andre11dr> I mean, people 30 years ago thought we would have flying cars by now
[1:36:35] <%Am_Shigar00> @datasuna true dat
[1:36:37] <dds333a> Viddy well Kappa
[1:36:38] <exclamatia> Where we're going Marty... we still need roads.
[1:37:06] <+Kyma1020> barren wasteland..just watch
[1:37:16] <LordOfThePoultry> oh now we get to smt 1
[1:37:17] <drunken_lemur> Demifiend?
[1:37:19] <WeijiBeng> if?
[1:37:21] <dds333a> good old SMT I protag
[1:37:23] <%king_wragles> That could be a Yugioh reference Kappa
[1:37:23] <andre11dr> So that's SMT II
[1:37:33] <exclamatia> is that still smt1? i know it has a timeskip
[1:37:47] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr it's the backstory of smt2, what the smt1 hero did after his story
[1:37:51] <%Am_Shigar00> Probably after smt1 but not quite smt2 yet
[1:37:55] <+Kyma1020> Devil Summoner Digital Devil Saga?
[1:37:57] <Blank9> SMT1, 2, and 4's protags all have their little arm-mounted comps
[1:38:08] <Blank9> SMT If...'s does too
[1:38:19] <linSP> smt 3, it’s implied you are the computer with all the circuits tattoos on your body
[1:38:21] <exclamatia> demifiend just orders em around
[1:38:21] <dds333a> Secret Kappa
[1:38:44] <+Kyma1020> aaaaàa

[1:39:15] <+Orcapugs> The true DREAD

[1:39:40] <BlackermanZX> this is some scooby doo shit
[1:40:00] <exclamatia> ruh roh raidou
[1:40:01] <kokorogensou> man the battle theme still kicks ass
[1:40:01] <andre11dr> I like Demi-Fiend doesn't need the hand thing, HE IS THE SUMMONING DEVICE
[1:40:04] <WeijiBeng> susanoo
[1:40:59] <dds333a> big damage
[1:41:18] <%Am_Shigar00> Has it been confirmed what the situation with the Nahobino in V is? I’m assuming it’ll be like demifiend and he can just use them
[1:41:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:41:44] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 not certain, but it's more. like a Dagda situation so far
[1:41:58] <dds333a> A demonic sponsor is enabling them to do it
[1:41:59] <%mr_sups> sups
[1:42:23] <%Am_Shigar00> Hm
[1:42:37] <andre11dr> Man i really hope Dagda is summonble im V
[1:42:39] <huskarl_zap> THROW ROCKS AT IT
[1:42:44] <turboyabo> good job picking a slow phys demon for heal
[1:42:53] <andre11dr> He is based on an actual diety after all
[1:43:17] <dds333a> @andre11dr it wouldn't be SMT otherwise LUL
[1:43:34] <%Am_Shigar00> I don’t see why they wouldn’t make Dagda summonable, they’ve made almost every other demon from SMTA summonable so far, even his mom.
[1:44:05] <+LandOfTheWay> i'd only want dagda back if they actually made him even remotely like his mythological counterpart
[1:44:09] <Qu1ckyyy> @Am_Shigar00 Dagda is very important to the story of IVa maybe that's why
[1:44:12] <exclamatia> can i summon nozomis shotgun
[1:44:43] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy well, so is Danu, no?
[1:44:56] <WeijiBeng> " I hope agony is summonable on SMT The 5th"
[1:45:06] <dds333a> @weijibeng yes, please
[1:45:14] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS

[1:45:48] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[1:45:50] <Qu1ckyyy> @dds333a Yeah but Dagda is like your Aogami, that's why I think he won't be available
[1:45:53] <BlackermanZX> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:45:58] <exclamatia> Raidou saw images of the 2040s..... the nintendo playstation series X releases
[1:46:00] <andre11dr> They ARE sitting there
[1:46:11] <TheBlackestBaron> IMAGINE?
[1:46:13] <turboyabo> cthulu
[1:46:19] <+blankwaffle> Waterworld lol
[1:46:29] <+LandOfTheWay> @TheBlackestBaron smt2 setting being established, i believe
[1:46:35] <dds333a> @theblackestbaron the every end of SMT I, but yeah leading right into Imagine
[1:46:45] <dds333a> *very
[1:46:59] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh hey, i recently fought you in DeSu2! You were kind of a joke despite being a mini boss.
[1:47:05] <andre11dr> Imagine was the MMO right?
[1:47:08] <WeijiBeng> I actually miss hito's presence on IMagine
[1:47:10] <TheBlackestBaron> yes
[1:47:12] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[1:47:13] <andre11dr> Or is that NINE
[1:47:16] <%livlinn> woolieACCIDENT
[1:47:27] <dds333a> He has a much cooler art, too
[1:47:31] <%Am_Shigar00> Imagine is the mmo, NINE is the xbox game
[1:48:00] <WeijiBeng> xbox emulation supercoolTF
[1:48:25] <exclamatia> i hope we get to see more like. biblical angels in smtv. true merkabah was awesome
[1:48:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:48:33] <andre11dr> I always confuse NINE ,IMAGINE and If
[1:49:14] <%Am_Shigar00> To be fair, NINE was also originally a part of an MMO or some shit before stuff issues happened, so I can get the confusion.
[1:49:41] <turboyabo> ah yes the old faithfull ... whose weak to the wind
[1:49:46] <exclamatia> what if nine got a sequel called TEN and it started in heaven
[1:49:55] <dds333a> @turboyabo I waiting for it, yeah LUL
[1:50:13] <WeijiBeng> we all waiting Ronde 2
[1:50:23] <dds333a> @weijibeng Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:50:24] <%Am_Shigar00> I get that these are supposed to be “memories” or something of these fights, but did we really need to repeat the dialogue as well?
[1:50:34] <andre11dr> We're waiting on a a new Raidou too
[1:50:40] <turboyabo> soma
[1:50:45] <andre11dr> Or  a Devil Summoner
[1:50:51] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[1:50:52] <%Am_Shigar00> I really want a new Raidou.
[1:51:05] <%livlinn> psaBig woolieACCIDENT
[1:51:17] <andre11dr> I kinda want something crazy for a new Raidou
[1:51:34] <exclamatia> you play as raidou the 41st
[1:51:38] <andre11dr> Like Radiou time travel to NY in the 70s or some shit
[1:51:44] <WeijiBeng> I mean, tecmo asked JP fans which series should get a warrior game, Purse owner supercoolSad
[1:52:09] <%Am_Shigar00> It wouldn’t be the first time Raidou would do something like that. ‘Looks at SMTIII’
[1:52:15] <WeijiBeng> jp actually answered SMT :v
[1:52:25] <@Solidus_113> "Raidou WHO? Where's Dante"
[1:52:26] <dds333a> They really could do a Raidou 3, maybe even a Debisama 5,
[1:52:38] <turboyabo> it dose work woolie is just hitting the boss at the worse time , like during the super
[1:53:03] <%Am_Shigar00> in all seriousness, I wouldn’t mind an Raidou 3 in the musou style if they built off of Striker’s foundation.
[1:53:07] <WeijiBeng> I would die for a maken but first person again
[1:53:12] <dds333a> @turboyabo exactly, they just have animations that have armor, phase 1 should be weak to fire, iirc
[1:53:15] <andre11dr> Also they really REALLY should port SJ
[1:53:38] <@Solidus_113> atlus should do a lot of things
[1:53:42] <andre11dr> Just trow it in PC or the Switch
[1:53:47] <dds333a> @solidus_113 LUL LUL
[1:53:48] <%Am_Shigar00> They should port over all their dungeon crawlers. Give me EO on console please!
[1:53:53] <andre11dr> You are literally doing nothing with it
[1:54:15] <exclamatia> i wonder if theyre gonna like. gauge smt series success with smtv and if it does well, maybe we'll see more old smt come out again
[1:54:53] <dds333a> @exclamatia all I know is that it'll sell well. if not I did my part LUL
[1:54:53] <WeijiBeng> I hope so because, if persona becomes the main series, I'm doomed
[1:55:04] <andre11dr> I mean fuck, I'm asking for SJ but they aren't even capable of porting DDS
[1:55:14] <%Am_Shigar00> I mean, Persona has practically been the main series for a while now.
[1:55:29] <exclamatia> persona has just totally dropped the SMT by this point lol
[1:55:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[1:55:31] <andre11dr> You know THEY'RE BEST PS2 GAMES
[1:56:05] <exclamatia> thinks about argilla BibleThump
[1:56:28] <dds333a> @exclamatia it never had it in the first place. the SMT was added in western territories like most games LUL
[1:56:37] <+blankwaffle> do you have resurrect items?
[1:56:50] <dds333a> It started Megmi Ibunroku: Persona, and was just Persona fro mthen on
[1:56:55] <turboyabo> all im loving how seig just peaced out every time he was casting death
[1:56:55] <exclamatia> fair
[1:57:09] <%Am_Shigar00> Then they reused megami ibunroku for the first DeSu.
[1:57:33] <lonosis47> How have they still not beat this game lmao
[1:57:52] <exclamatia> takin it ez
[1:58:08] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 exactly, and the sequel was jait Devil survivor
[1:58:28] <%Am_Shigar00> Then they sorta reused it again for the japanese title of Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
[1:58:59] <andre11dr> I keep forgetting about that thi
[1:59:06] <andre11dr> thing*
[1:59:19] <exclamatia> triglavs horse looks
[1:59:21] <exclamatia> weird
[1:59:22] <turboyabo> that was almost a game over
[1:59:24] <%Am_Shigar00> “Genei Ibunroku #FE” if I recall
[1:59:43] <%Am_Shigar00> Meaning the actual game’s title is just... #FE.
[1:59:48] <dds333a> Can't also forget about Giten, and all the other "Megami Tensei" derivs there are
[2:00:13] <andre11dr> And then there's Majin Tensei
[2:00:19] <Qu1ckyyy> Where in the timeline does Trauma Center take place tho?

[2:01:00] <%Am_Shigar00> Honestly, even if it makes the titles a lot more wordy, I’m kind of glad the US releases added Smt just because it makes this shit easier to keep track of.
[2:01:04] <dds333a> uhhhh
[2:01:09] <andre11dr> Also the there's the phone game as well, don't know if that's part of the timeline

[2:02:55] <Qu1ckyyy> @dds333a Tokyo Millennium Tower? Was Kiryu Law all along?
[2:03:05] <dds333a> @andre11dr nah, Law sticks it to them too LUL
[2:04:00] <andre11dr> Mara IS pretty OP tho
[2:04:10] <turboyabo> u cant heal if u weak
[2:04:30] <andre11dr> Like in Raidou his a really important side quest
[2:04:36] <%Am_Shigar00> I made it a tradition to share a lv. 99 Mara for street pass in all my 3DS games they’re in.
[2:04:49] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 LUL
[2:04:50] <exclamatia> not a level 69 mara?
[2:05:03] <LordOfThePoultry> @Am_Shigar00 you monster LUL
[2:05:03] <drunken_lemur> Try spinning. That's a good trick.
[2:05:26] <andre11dr> It has to the right Mara tho
[2:05:34] <%haitakaa> pineapple pen
[2:05:35] <%Am_Shigar00> @exclamatia that’s the best mara, but not the strongest. Best mara is a power no human should have
[2:05:49] <dds333a> @andre11dr indeed LUL very particular
[2:06:02] <andre11dr> Mara dosen't hit the same without the chariot
[2:06:13] <andre11dr> Looking at you SMT III
[2:06:18] <andre11dr> Cowards
[2:06:36] <%Am_Shigar00> Not their fault, they were infused with the body of a slime because the summoners effed up
[2:06:48] <WeijiBeng> Mara (Amorgus)
[2:06:59] <dds333a> @andre11dr they flubbed the summoning, what can you do LUL
[2:07:40] <andre11dr> SMT III has a lot of wierd out place comedy
[2:07:52] <andre11dr> It's that damn theme song too
[2:08:04] <%Am_Shigar00> Tis a very silly game at times.
[2:08:15] <dds333a> @andre11dr every game in the franchise has lots of humor, but maybe Nocturne kinda clashed
[2:08:16] <exclamatia> demons like to good
[2:08:19] <exclamatia> *goof
[2:08:20] <+kinmarik> are there other smt games like this one?
[2:08:22] <WeijiBeng> 40 STR supercoolChad
[2:08:30] <exclamatia> Raidou 2 Kappa

[2:09:02] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 exactly LUL
[2:09:16] <exclamatia> i think thats a Bravely Default thing actually lol
[2:09:22] <exclamatia> Banker job
[2:09:25] <turboyabo> well i feel like woolie missed a sub quest to lower heal price
[2:09:46] <dds333a> @turboyabo is there one? that would be news to me
[2:09:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:10:08] <%Am_Shigar00> I’ve certainly never seen a price reduction side quest. I think they’re just naturally that steep.
[2:10:29] <turboyabo> it could just be he hoarded all his sellable
[2:10:29] <dds333a> Nakisawame inherited the Trish business model LUL
[2:10:48] <andre11dr> Yeah that seems like the 2010s

[2:12:39] <dds333a> and there she goes again
[2:12:40] <turboyabo> these celtic ninjas really be out here
[2:12:43] <WeijiBeng> chat did woolie say anything about FC2 rollback cvs?
[2:13:11] <andre11dr> I find it wierd that all the demons are voiced but none of the dialogue
[2:13:37] <andre11dr> I guess DDS was the first time they has fully voiced dialogue
[2:13:38] <DSD24> SMT games didn't really have voice acting till I think Digital Devil Saga?
[2:13:43] <%Am_Shigar00> Probably just the devs adding in their own short voice clips
[2:13:51] <+xerotwo> If it said 2020, i'd be freaking out
[2:13:53] <turboyabo> using really old bark auido
[2:14:01] <DSD24> I remember this fight!
[2:14:04] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 with actual voice actors too

[2:20:45] <dds333a> @mathochism oh there are several penis demons. check out Ometeotl
[2:20:48] <andre11dr> There's multiple dick monsters in SMT
[2:21:02] <dds333a> Jarilo is pretty good too Kappa
[2:21:03] <andre11dr> Well depending wich version
[2:21:03] <%Am_Shigar00> I remember SMT IV had a naked toilet lady.
[2:21:04] <turboyabo> wait until u see the box demon
[2:21:19] <DSD24> @Am_Shigar00 There was also Belephgor
[2:21:30] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh Belehpgor.
[2:21:55] <+RaveBV> There's one demon with multiple breasts on top of her head. There's another with nipples all over her body.
[2:21:58] <andre11dr> There's also Cthulu
[2:22:17] <andre11dr> With his huge mouth dick
[2:22:19] <dds333a> @andre11dr one of the most blatant LUL
[2:22:20] <+RaveBV> Cthulhu's tongue is a literal penis.
[2:22:32] <+RaveBV> As funny as Mara's design is, he's one of the designs that don't make much sense in comparison to his lore.
[2:22:36] <turboyabo> and satan with his boobs
[2:22:44] <%Am_Shigar00> There’s also that pig king guy and his big hanging penis.
[2:22:48] <Qu1ckyyy> What do you think, how many Penis and Vagina demons will SMTV have?
[2:22:55] <DSD24> All of them
[2:23:00] <+RaveBV> About 10
[2:23:07] <%Am_Shigar00> Well, we already know they brought back vagina belly from II.
[2:23:11] <dds333a> @qu1ckyyy I'm gonna say many, but no new ones :(
[2:23:15] <antarac> Diana is the head tittes
[2:23:17] <+RaveBV> Now if we're counting demons with penises hanging out, maybe 15
[2:23:19] <andre11dr> @ravebv Well Mara tempted Buddha with the sex you see
[2:23:28] <+RaveBV> Yeah, but that's kind of a stretch.
[2:23:36] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[2:23:38] <%ZweihanderSteve> CURSED
[2:23:39] <+xerotwo> LUL
[2:23:44] <Qu1ckyyy> Instant crazy talk
[2:23:45] <Vernify> It just clipped him.
[2:23:47] <+RaveBV> LUL LUL
[2:24:16] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:24:31] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS
[2:24:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> ITS FINE
[2:24:35] <dds333a> He always does the twofer LUL
[2:24:36] <Qu1ckyyy> Comboed
[2:24:36] <andre11dr> What's the deal that's like a weird reptile girl with like 10 tits?
[2:24:40] <+RaveBV> ruuun
[2:24:46] <+RaveBV> lmao
[2:24:49] <turboyabo> stop using raksha go sake u have null mind demon
[2:24:50] <+RaveBV> spanwed in to get yeeted.
[2:24:51] <dds333a> @andre11dr Tiamat is pretty cool
[2:24:57] <%fetrigon> bruh
[2:24:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[2:25:00] <+RaveBV> A modern Raidou with an actual 3D worlse and no fixed camera would be so good.
[2:25:04] <%fetrigon> ragdolled
[2:25:08] <+RaveBV> world*
[2:25:14] <andre11dr> @dds333a Yeah Tiamat ,that's the one i was thinking
[2:25:20] <%livlinn> PsaBig MonkaS
[2:25:22] <dds333a> @fetrigon for real LUL
[2:25:29] <%DashXero> This must be a dollar store, cause this boss is cheap as hell.
[2:25:32] <DSD24> Plus it'd be cool if the next Raidou was a lady
[2:25:34] <%ZweihanderSteve> the exact opposite would be even cooler mondern raidou@ravebv
[2:25:47] <%Am_Shigar00> Raidou 2 at least has 3d battle arenas a way better controls, so that’s a plus
[2:26:03] <+RaveBV> Arioch's stomach is a massive vagina with teeth.
[2:26:07] <Vernify> Yeah the sequel is a large improvement in almost everyday.
[2:26:10] <time_axis> unfortunately 2 has other issues.
[2:26:21] <turboyabo> come on i know he likes him but this wasting time
[2:26:53] <+RaveBV> Google SMT Rahu, his head is the worst. He has a penis sticking out of it. It's not even an exaggerated head like Mara or this boss, it's just an erect penis on his forehead.
[2:27:10] <DSD24> This is dire
[2:27:19] <+RaveBV> unlucky
[2:27:31] <%Am_Shigar00> @ravebv looked it up and wow, you ain’t kidding
[2:27:50] <turboyabo> woolie is causing his on problem by using only rak
[2:27:57] <andre11dr> As much as Raidou 2 improves over 1 ,i still like the story in 1 more
[2:28:13] <+RaveBV> Google Master Therion, he's packing HEAT. Diana is also a funny SMT design, she has titties on her head.
[2:28:14] <Qu1ckyyy> @andre11dr agreed
[2:28:28] <dds333a> @turboyabo as has happened a few times LUL
[2:28:28] <andre11dr> 2 starts REALLY dragging towards the end
[2:28:36] <%Am_Shigar00> That’s the general impression I’ve heard from people. Still, I’m someone who’ll take better gameplay over better story.
[2:28:52] <turboyabo> summon thoth
[2:29:01] <dds333a> The infamous Orochi fight had a hint by the way too LUL
[2:29:11] <andre11dr> Also this is a way cooler final zone than what 2 offers
[2:29:15] <Qu1ckyyy> nothing comes close to 1 craziness and 2 was really aggresive with the route questions
[2:29:41] <dds333a> Susan and Oumi all summoned their adds two by two, but Oorchi only summons two mollis and one jack LUL
[2:30:26] <turboyabo> aaah i see two demoms that drain mind
[2:30:29] <+RaveBV> The coward plays, woolie!
[2:30:35] <Dopamien> does atlus ever add demons to their list?

[2:30:49] <time_axis> @Dopamien yeah most games add new ones
[2:30:54] <dds333a> @dopamien a couple practically every game
[2:31:04] <%Am_Shigar00> Thankfully we’ve avoided him having an charmed demon healing him back to full health this time around
[2:31:12] <+RaveBV> lmao
[2:31:15] <DSD24> There's that new werewolf guy in SMT5 for example
[2:31:21] <Dopamien> ah maybe because I've gone in reverse order with things I don't know whats new
[2:31:49] <Qu1ckyyy> oh god not now
[2:31:52] <%Am_Shigar00> Welp
[2:31:54] <dds333a> stunned, yeah
[2:31:58] <time_axis> he might not have the MP to heal the boss
[2:31:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:31:59] <Qu1ckyyy> LUCKYYYY
[2:32:07] <andre11dr> @dopamien They add a couple of new one each game, also they make demons that where noplayable in the older games
[2:32:12] <turboyabo> good job woolie ur feed the charmed demon
[2:32:16] <%Am_Shigar00> At least he doesn’t have much mo to heal him back to max
[2:32:23] <%Am_Shigar00> *mp
[2:32:34] <+cerisekingu> ayee
[2:32:44] <+cerisekingu> finally get to catch a woolie stream
[2:32:47] <andre11dr> Like V has a lot story demons from IV and Strange Journey
[2:33:02] <dds333a> But yeah, it was Raiju and ippon, then Obariyon and Pyro Ja
[2:33:15] <%ZweihanderSteve> LMAO
[2:33:19] <+GeorgioFiorello> CLUTCH
[2:33:23] <dds333a> SeemsGood
[2:33:23] <%livlinn> shiaHypers
[2:33:27] <+RaveBV> Pun intended because of his head?
[2:33:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> good smts always got THE ONE
[2:33:36] <Blank9> he's long and strong
[2:33:38] <turboyabo> the caused it to be clutch
[2:33:41] <%Am_Shigar00> Yeah, V’s roster is like 90% P5, 9% SMTIVA and SJ, and 1% new models of old demons
[2:33:51] <andre11dr> SMT has those fucki bosses sometimes
[2:33:59] <andre11dr> Sometimes all the time
[2:34:01] <Dopamien> @andre11dr I'm still pretty new to smt but I'll have to catch up prior to V
[2:34:01] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 P5 LUL
[2:34:11] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @Am_Shigar00 the gacha game has better models
[2:34:16] <dds333a> Most of the demons in P5 were around since SMT NINE
[2:34:22] <+RaveBV> SMT has some bosses who will charm allies with a heal, then have your demons heal them from 10% to 100% HP.
[2:34:22] <OblivionSword1> @Am_Shigar00 that makes sense since they probably reuse P5 models
[2:34:34] <dds333a> P5 just overhauled the models,
[2:34:35] <andre11dr> Sometimes they get like 5
[2:34:44] <%Am_Shigar00> I mean that most of the models are pulled from 5, it’s super blatent.
[2:34:57] <dds333a> @oblivionsword1 you'd think , but they're actually overhauling the models again
[2:35:09] <andre11dr> V apparently has completely new models
[2:35:11] <Dopamien> 1 turn to attack, then 1 turn to put up magic/physical barrier calebKek
[2:35:22] <OblivionSword1> huh
[2:35:28] <andre11dr> Which is bafeling
[2:35:34] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> i just hope the rest of doi's demons are in i want my boys krishna and dagda
[2:35:45] <OblivionSword1> that's like highly unnecessary
[2:35:46] <dds333a> I though they would just use P5 too, but they're just building them with the same skeletons they've used since '02
[2:35:47] <andre11dr> You'd think they'd just use the 05 models
[2:35:50] <turboyabo> like look at that list of demons u wasted re sourse because that fight
[2:36:03] <+RaveBV> @Am_Shigar00 Yeah, a lot of them are just pulled from P5 and cleaned up+new textures for V. Another part of why SJ and IV demons are being so big for V's story is because they are the ones Doi designed, not Kaneko. Kaneko is taking over as lead artist for SMT games now, so they're pushing his redesigns.
[2:36:03] <%Am_Shigar00> @andre11dr I’m honestly not sure how much I believe that. At the very least they textured differently though.
[2:36:15] <time_axis> there was controversy around Krishna in SMT4A, so hopefully that doesnt deter them
[2:36:55] <andre11dr> Wait what, what's the Krishna thing?
[2:36:59] <dds333a> @ravebv all of the demons in SJ were made by Kaneko, you mean Redux
[2:37:01] <+Exicuren> that was a "controversy" only one dude from India
[2:37:09] <+RaveBV> @Am_Shigar00 You can tell by how much animations are being reused and how little animations the demons in V have in general. They only have 3 different kinds: Walking, skill cast, and taking damage. They reuse the skill cast animation for reactions in demon conversation.
[2:37:21] <%Am_Shigar00> @ravebv I’m really loving all the new unique attack animations they’re giving the Doi demons. I hope they continue to carry those forward in future games,
[2:37:22] <andre11dr> Oh did a Hindu dude get mad ?
[2:37:32] <+RaveBV> @dds333a Yes, SJ Redux is what I was referring to.
[2:37:42] <dds333a> @ravebv those animations are the exact same animations from NINE LUL
[2:37:53] <andre11dr> Why ,like Vishnu and Shiva have been in SMT forever
[2:37:58] <turboyabo> well thank god the final boss dosent use charm abilites or woolie be screwed
[2:37:58] <+RaveBV> @dds333a I believe some are from SMT Imagine, the MMO.
[2:38:02] <dds333a> For example, Onmoraki on P5 jas the EXACT same animations from DDS
[2:38:05] <+Exicuren> Yes, but no one paid attention to that dude because he was like an extremist religious person wth no influence
[2:38:09] <time_axis> they got mad that they made Krisnu look like "a mobster" rather than a  God
[2:38:19] <andre11dr> Woolie has literally killed Parvati like 10 times up until now LUL
[2:38:23] <time_axis> although I love his design
[2:38:24] <+Exicuren> so the Krishna thing was glossed over
[2:38:43] <dds333a> @ravebv Titania in NINE has the same animations they used later, but Imagine added new demons yeah
[2:38:47] <+RaveBV> It's actually really odd they chose to use P5's models and animations though. SMT:DX2 has higher quality models than all the current SMT and Persona games to date. Seriously, go google DX2 Pixie's model. It's extremely high quality.
[2:38:59] <turboyabo> those idiots he was in human form
[2:39:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:16] <dds333a> @ravebv DX2 has the same animations thi LUL
[2:39:21] <turboyabo> of course he look like that
[2:39:29] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> krishna, adram and finn mccool are my endgame team
[2:39:53] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @RaveBV
[2:40:07] <andre11dr> Dosen't DX2 have like a shit loads of demons? and they all have 3D models
[2:40:19] <+RaveBV> @dds333a Same animation, but they're not ported. You can tell they were made from scratch. Even the models are higher poly and different
[2:40:24] <turboyabo> coward weird god with big back downs
[2:40:36] <dds333a> @ravebv I never said they were the same models
[2:40:51] <dds333a> @andre11dr yeah, and the majority already had models
[2:40:51] <PanicSwytch> Damn im late. Is this the final dungeon?
[2:41:00] <+RaveBV> @andre11dr Yeah, it's a gacha, so they're constantly adding them. It also has cross overs from Bayonetta and DMC for demons. The game's demon models and textures are so high quality that they could just port over DMC5's Dante and Nero models and the style doesn't clash.
[2:41:02] <dds333a> @panicswytch sure is
[2:41:12] <%DashXero> @PanicSwytch Probably. You haven't missed much.
[2:41:38] <andre11dr> Uhh ,i hope we get Bayo in V ,that would be wild
[2:41:38] <%Am_Shigar00> I’m assuming being a gacha game, Dx2 has the time to drip feed new models rather than having to make them all ready in a 2-3 year development period like most games. Haven’t really been following the game in detail to know for sure so go ahead and correct me if I’m wrong.
[2:41:47] <andre11dr> It is on Switch after all
[2:42:15] <dds333a> As said before, these games iterate on models with each successive game, but Atlus has used the same library of skeletons, since NINE
[2:42:21] <+RaveBV> One thing DX2 does that I wish SMT games did more is the introduction of having multiple designs of a single demon in a game. For example, you can encounter and summon both the blond Nekomata design and the older purple haired "furry" one.
[2:42:47] <+Exicuren> well, it's a gacha
[2:42:52] <+RaveBV> true
[2:42:52] <andre11dr> I do know DX2 has both Alice designs
[2:43:11] <dds333a> that's why demons always have the same hurt. spellcasting ailment, attacking etc. animations
[2:43:13] <+Exicuren> more models and versions, more money
[2:43:26] <andre11dr> They have the old green Alice witch look weird
[2:43:27] <%Am_Shigar00> That would be neat. The only other case I can think of something like that was SMTIVA using the alt Angel design as a endgame demon vs. the starter game version.
[2:43:46] <+RaveBV> Yeah, that was cool, though alt angel was DLC.. if I recall correctly.
[2:43:48] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 there are four angel designs too LUL
[2:43:49] <%Am_Shigar00> Even then, that was basically just a different costume
[2:43:52] <%DashXero> Sounds like a couple of years from now.

[3:31:04] <time_axis> doesnt he have like 5 somas
[3:31:27] <turboyabo> he wasted that on rak
[3:31:32] <andre11dr> Bruh Woolie is really fighting the final boss will Toth LUL
[3:31:49] <linSP> nothing likes almighty, not even almighty
[3:32:18] <%Taylorton147> not a huge hitbox huh
[3:32:19] <LVL1_Scumbag> Turns out regen is pretty good
[3:32:31] <DSD24> Battle of attrition
[3:32:52] <%Am_Shigar00> This whole fight gets exhausting
[3:32:55] <time_axis> every SMT final boss takes a while
[3:32:55] <DSD24> I thought Woolie said War Crimes for a second
[3:33:25] <turboyabo> i hope he runs out of revives and revive rak
[3:33:29] <dds333a> @time_axis granted this a. bit different due to the play at habd LUL
[3:33:33] <andre11dr> This fight usually takes a while, but Woolie also has like really shiti demons for this fight
[3:33:52] <dds333a> @andre11dr no, there's a bigger reason why
[3:34:01] <Dopamien> why are all the all powerful god beings giant face/hand monsters in the end
[3:34:37] <dds333a> @dopamien it's humanity distilled to it's most basic? idk
[3:35:01] <turboyabo> yeah he wasnt thinking . about the null and drains he was looking at damage and if there easy catch
[3:35:03] <Qu1ckyyy> these iframes are really helpful
[3:35:07] <BlackermanZX> whats a god to the Thoth Slayer
[3:35:21] <andre11dr> @dopamien Lucifer wasn't, also Satan wasn't
[3:35:38] <Dopamien> @andre11dr thats a better trade off, at least you can live a somewhat normal life
[3:35:53] <turboyabo> like you can tell which demons are fusions and which are just caught demons
[3:35:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:36:01] <Dopamien> becomes a giant monster god, can't have the sex anymore FeelsBadMan
[3:36:05] <%ZweihanderSteve> good video games SeemsGood

[3:37:22] <DSD24> Woolie is nothing if not unorthodox
[3:37:38] <Blank9> thoth rules
[3:37:43] <DSD24> I'd be the type to beat this boss with Pyro Jack or something
[3:37:46] <turboyabo> he can take on this giant god monsterd
[3:37:47] <%ZweihanderSteve> just shows the malleability of this game
[3:37:50] <dds333a> @dsd24 if not completely foolish LUL

[3:50:37] <DSD24> The cover up
[3:50:47] <time_axis> Victor was literally frankenstein, yeah.  He has dialogue about traveling the arctic on a boat
[3:51:00] <dds333a> @juriasu destroying all those hour glasses changed the timeline

[3:51:59] <DSD24> Oh

[3:52:11] <turboyabo> yes
[3:52:13] <BlackermanZX> Green eyes
[3:52:22] <%haitakaa> featuring dante from devil may cry
[3:52:25] <andre11dr> Bruh i literally killed like 50 of those in SMT III
[3:52:27] <time_axis> Raidou vs the eternal cameo appearances
[3:52:30] <Blank9> rip forever raidou, you were cool
[3:52:34] <dds333a> Also, Sadakichi is a Navy man LUL
[3:52:40] <@Solidus_113> not dante
[3:52:42] <%Lion_kun> What did we learn from this crazy adventure?
[3:52:44] <turboyabo> they where too lazy to give it another leg
[3:52:45] <DSD24> Also Soul Hackers
[3:52:47] <vapelad_dabberb01> he's in soul hackers too
[3:52:49] <linSP> raidou or dante
[3:52:53] <andre11dr> Also Soul Hackers
[3:52:53] <BlackermanZX> also soul hackers
[3:52:54] <+RaveBV> He cameos or comes in as a boss in a couple of SMT games.
[3:52:55] <aaasxz1> there's a manga that takes place after raido 2
[3:52:55] <+Kyma1020> also soul hackers
[3:52:56] <dds333a> @andre11dr that wasn't actually Yatagarasu
[3:52:59] <Qu1ckyyy> two times
[3:53:10] <%haitakaa> isn't there a new Raidou in SMT V?
[3:53:10] <%Am_Shigar00> He does show up in Soul Hackers too. Even has the soulless god as a demon. It’s great.
[3:53:13] <+LandOfTheWay> @woolieversus he's also a bonus boss in soul hackers, and he got his own manga
[3:53:16] <%Juriasu> SourPls
[3:53:16] <+projectmanatees> And soul hackers
[3:53:19] <jman13131313> He is i n soul hacker
[3:53:22] <vapelad_dabberb01> maybe give persona a rest, throw my man raidou a bone
[3:53:28] <dds333a> @haitakaa no, Shouhei I'd not related at all
[3:53:29] <turboyabo> aaaaah gouto
[3:53:40] <andre11dr> This one of the easier ones so it was fine
[3:53:48] <+MakoTensei> 2 is better
[3:53:54] <+SilverDevilfish> And now to continue the Rasputin saga Woolie will play Shadow Hearts Covenant Kappa
[3:53:56] <%Am_Shigar00> I personally had fun with it, but I don’t think I could personally go back to it again.
[3:53:59] <dds333a> Woolie never realized you can give commands to your demons
[3:54:00] <DSD24> I think you get Dodge Rolls too
[3:54:06] <turboyabo> that makes no sense not to explain he can change form
[3:54:08] <vapelad_dabberb01> woolie getting redpilled on megaten?
[3:54:29] <andre11dr> If you where playing SMT III and you where using the demons you had in that last battle, that would've been very rough
[3:54:29] <Blank9> nope, just raido
[3:54:29] <%Am_Shigar00> @dds333a is that not what “support/heal me” was?
[3:54:30] <dds333a> definitely would be better if he was a character
[3:54:35] <+LandOfTheWay> he talks a bit in the manga, but he's still pretty quiet
[3:54:37] <DSD24> Raidou talks a bunch in Soul Hackers
[3:54:46] <OblivionSword1> there's the ship
[3:54:48] <Dr_Servbot> lets see the other intro too
[3:54:48] <dds333a> @am_shigar00 no, you can literally tell demons what to to fo by move LUL
[3:54:53] <%Am_Shigar00> Soul Hackers did give him some dialogue. Voiced by Matt Mercer at that.
[3:55:03] <%fetrigon> @dds333a OMEGALUL
[3:55:04] <time_axis> chronologically first in the franchise
[3:55:07] <%Am_Shigar00> @dds333a aaaah,
[3:55:08] <%haitakaa> hey Woolie have you played Digital Devil Saga?
[3:55:11] <+vaderxyz1970> Now show Reggie Mara
[3:55:16] <BolognaMann> swaos
[3:55:18] <vapelad_dabberb01> woolie vs nocturne?
[3:55:18] <dds333a> @turboyabo Gouto is always astrally inhabiting a cat
[3:55:19] <andre11dr> No ,do come back, those dudes are OP.as hell in yhe sequel
[3:55:25] <jett_eyes> Dude you gotta play Digital Devil Saga
[3:55:25] <+LandOfTheWay> KANEKO THE GOAT
[3:55:26] <turboyabo> raidou would baiscally be just like other  raidou
[3:55:34] <DSD24> Digital Devil Saga is great!
[3:55:42] <time_axis> great playthrough, guys
[3:55:43] <DSD24> RPG where you have DTs all the time
[3:55:46] <dds333a> Woolie also never realized Orders correspond to investigation skills LUL LUL
[3:55:48] <turboyabo> yea dds
[3:55:49] <%Prevot> GGs
[3:55:51] <%Am_Shigar00> The raidou manga does dabble in a bit of dialogue too, nit as much as soul hackers though
[3:55:57] <Blank9> digital devil saga's a great intro
[3:56:01] <andre11dr> Nah play Strange Journey Kappa
[3:56:08] <dds333a> @dsd24 exactly, I agree
[3:56:12] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr unironically yes
[3:56:16] <turboyabo> yeah steve blum
[3:56:18] <DSD24> @andre11dr Honestly that wouldn't even be bad
[3:56:21] <dds333a> @blank9 which one Kappa
[3:56:36] <vapelad_dabberb01> dds is so good
[3:56:38] <+MakoTensei> digital devil saga is the best story atlus ever wrote
[3:56:45] <+IxDomxI> all of ps2 era smt slaps tbh
[3:56:47] <DSD24> Demi Fiend is the best protagonist
[3:56:48] <Blank9> clearly you start with 2, you won't be lost at all
[3:56:50] <andre11dr> Could you imagine Woolie playing SJ? Like he would get so fucking lost, that LP would last a year LUL
[3:56:53] <exclamatia> woolieeee play digital devil saga
[3:56:55] <time_axis> DDS is good, yeah, and not too long either unless you count both games together
[3:56:55] <dds333a> @makotensei hard AGREE
[3:57:01] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh man, if he did do raidou 2, would his set-up allow him to import his save from raidou 1?
[3:57:10] <+LandOfTheWay> @andre11dr yes, but it'd be funny
[3:57:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:57:10] <turboyabo> it way better then indivisble which is a pale copy of digital devil saga
[3:57:18] <time_axis> @Am_Shigar00 yeah that's not hard, as long as he doesnt delete it
[3:57:19] <vapelad_dabberb01> dds and persona 2 are the best storytelling to have ever come out of atlus
[3:57:19] <jett_eyes> the World. AKA Japan
[3:57:21] <Blank9> it should, I emulated them for a replay and imported save no problem
[3:57:31] <%Am_Shigar00> @time_axis that’s good to hear
[3:57:31] <DSD24> The world folded into itself via sphere
[3:57:34] <andre11dr> DDS and SJ are my favorite settings
[3:57:50] <dds333a> Also. Weird British accents, instead if 1920's American slang LUL
[3:58:05] <dds333a> Still love reggie's vo work SeemsGood
[3:58:29] <turboyabo> dds is more needed and you get to play as adults
[3:58:32] <Blank9> it's like an infinite train face
[3:58:36] <dds333a> and it bends the universe around it, since it is the universe
[3:59:01] <andre11dr> Yeah in DDS you're trying to assent to Nirvana and you're literally progressing to each version of the chakras
[3:59:02] <%Am_Shigar00> I need ti get around to DDS at some point, but I want to finish DS2 and DeSu2 first.
[3:59:06] <DSD24> In the Kingdom of Mikado
[3:59:21] <Blank9> soul hackers ends up with all the native american mythology, blended with the most 90s cyberpunk
[3:59:28] <@Solidus_113> Minotaur holds the gate to tokyo
[3:59:28] <+MakoTensei> Hoy
[3:59:33] <morow1ec> why would you spoil it
[3:59:40] <DSD24> Then you fight a Desert Eagle
[3:59:43] <DSD24> find
[3:59:43] <linSP> I went into smtiv completely blind, so worth the slow beginning
[3:59:44] <dds333a> @morow1ec LUL
[3:59:45] <Qu1ckyyy> minotaur stops u
[3:59:52] <+RaveBV> AGI
[3:59:59] <SwampRock> HOY
[4:00:00] <Blank9> the nose and shoulders
[4:00:02] <dds333a> Put on a. good show
[4:00:06] <+LandOfTheWay> the reveal of tokyo in smtiv is so fucking good
[4:00:07] <+RaveBV> "I'll end it thus" -Hoy
[4:00:10] <%Am_Shigar00> SMTIV is a blast once you get past the cave
[4:00:22] <andre11dr> I really want to play some SMT now
[4:00:27] <%jinking79> that boss was the stopping point for players
[4:00:29] <dds333a> one of Doi's only good designs Kappa
[4:00:32] <jett_eyes> *smirk*
[4:00:43] <%Am_Shigar00> “Damn it walter!”
[4:00:46] <vapelad_dabberb01> smt rules, such a unique jrpg franchise
[4:00:52] <+RaveBV> It's some flat world shit, kind of. lol

[4:01:20] <Qu1ckyyy> 2030 something
[4:01:25] <+RaveBV> always nukes in SMT kicking the end off.
[4:01:31] <dds333a> SMT IV was a return to form in many ways, and it was a huge success
[4:01:35] <jett_eyes> fuckin Thorman
[4:01:45] <andre11dr> Has Woolie played Apocalypse?
[4:01:45] <%Am_Shigar00> I really hope SMTV is good and popular enough that er can get more spin-offs like Raidou again.
[4:01:52] <dds333a> Not connected to the previous games , guys LUL
[4:02:04] <+LandOfTheWay> @dds333a i like doi's satan and amon, as well as some of his unused designs for innana and dagda
[4:02:09] <dds333a> IV is it's own universe like most games
[4:02:27] <vapelad_dabberb01> thorman = truman?
[4:02:33] <Blank9> Thorman calls the nukes the "hammer of Thor" even, it's great
[4:02:46] <dds333a> @vapelad_dabberb01 you'd think, but no LUL
[4:02:46] <+RaveBV> @LandOfTheWay It's not actually Doi's Satan. 50% of the boss designs in SMTIV are random guest artists. in SMTIVA is where Doi gets to go back and redesign THOSE designs with his own style, hence why Lucifer looks better in IVA.
[4:02:49] <%Prevot> LUL
[4:02:56] <%xeromage> Dokapon pocket dimension
[4:02:58] <+RaveBV> Lucifer*
[4:03:13] <%Am_Shigar00> @ravebv Satan wasn’t in SMT4 though
[4:03:20] <turboyabo> i love how altus went away from the truth and indivisbles and went more for group mind and lies
[4:03:21] <+RaveBV> Yeah, I think he meant Lucifer.
[4:03:30] <dds333a> Gotou however, is directly based on Yukio Mishima
[4:03:43] <+LandOfTheWay> @RaveBV no i meant satan
[4:03:45] <+RaveBV> or was he talking about dragon headed satan in 4a?
[4:03:47] <+RaveBV> my bad.
[4:03:50] <andre11dr> Now i really want to play SMT ,i should do something i never played
[4:03:51] <Blank9> there's so many spinoffs
[4:04:06] <dds333a> albeit not SMT LUL
[4:04:06] <+LandOfTheWay> smtiv luci's design is fucking terrible, even with doi touching it up. satan on the other hand looks great
[4:04:07] <+RaveBV> I like Doi's Medusa a lot. I hope she appears in V as a summon.

[4:04:20] <Mattais88> #1300
[4:04:24] <Blank9> great sailor moon game
[4:04:26] <BlackermanZX> it was anime itself
[4:04:27] <%LurkerKraid> The best lp
[4:04:30] <%Am_Shigar00> Oh TMS. The LP that got me active on the subreddit
[4:04:33] <Qu1ckyyy> If only it had a different name
[4:04:34] <%paladinstarbuster> but not really
[4:04:36] <jett_eyes> you think SMTV will be the P5 of mainline?
[4:04:39] <+RaveBV> #FE was idol shit
[4:04:40] <andre11dr> Yeah i tried playing FE ,i was like NOPE
[4:04:40] <%brisk_dacat> The Loyal 30k
[4:04:44] <dds333a> It was more SMT than it was FE, at least LUL
[4:04:48] <%Am_Shigar00> @jett_eyes i really hope so.
[4:04:52] <%LastHazzerd> Idol apologists
[4:04:55] <%paladinstarbuster> #13000
[4:05:12] <%jinking79> #13k
[4:05:12] <dds333a> yeah, that was our fault for taking teaser footage as gospel :(
[4:05:12] <+RaveBV> TL;DR: It was Idol Persona but with SMT and FE references.
[4:05:15] <Blank9> it's for the Sailor Moon/P4Dancing All Night crowd
[4:05:15] <+LandOfTheWay> @jett_eyes highly doubt it, much as it prefer it to persona smt has sadly never had as much groundswell for a variety of reasons
[4:05:16] <%Am_Shigar00> That first trailer really doomed the project in the end.
[4:05:21] <+LandOfTheWay> *i prefer it
[4:05:27] <turboyabo> well smt is putting in more work then persona series
[4:05:29] <PanicSwytch> The amountnof bright colors in that game gave me headaches
[4:05:31] <%baka_sugoi> anime NotLikeThis
[4:05:33] <vapelad_dabberb01> persona but generic idol puke
[4:05:34] <%brisk_dacat> Also Boofu
[4:05:35] <@Solidus_113> the power of Barry
[4:05:36] <jkfd> man, TMS was *brilliant*
[4:05:37] <BlackermanZX> SMT x FE but 20x cringe
[4:05:38] <andre11dr> Yeah, that's why i couldn't get trew it
[4:05:38] <bear_breaker20> he says kids but they are legal by anime standards
[4:05:42] <dds333a> @landoftheway although Since IV, the games have sold amazingly
[4:05:45] <%Am_Shigar00> Heck, it’s not even very Persona in the end. It’s just tonally at best personaesq
[4:05:50] <dds333a> V is gonna sell well
[4:05:59] <%LastHazzerd> Barry Goodman
[4:06:00] <%ekodrop> mehheroi
[4:06:03] <andre11dr> It was like everything i hate about Persona but even more annoying
[4:06:13] <turboyabo> barry wants that young idol girl
[4:06:18] <Blank9> still a good game but not at all smt or fire emblem outside of gameplay
[4:06:24] <%LastHazzerd> thanks Adam
[4:06:32] <vapelad_dabberb01> tms is what megaten elitists say persona is
[4:06:41] <%Am_Shigar00> Having been playing through DeSu2 and how incredibly anime it gets, I saw where TMS got some of it’s humor from.
[4:06:47] <%LastHazzerd> Angel beats
