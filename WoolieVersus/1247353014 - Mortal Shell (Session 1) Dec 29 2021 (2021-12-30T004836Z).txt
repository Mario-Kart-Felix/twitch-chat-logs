[0:00:17] <%romulux420> yooooooo
[0:00:21] <badguy8312> helllo Madden San
[0:00:21] <%Deekman> hey guys, stoked to see this!
[0:00:23] <xerotwo> LUL
[0:00:26] <oneimportantthing> Gotta be honest, I just really can't get into Mortal Shell, but maybe this LP can change my mind
[0:00:29] <@Menitta> OH YEAH WHATD YOU THINK
[0:00:33] <%Theycallmenerf> I’m in debt, that’s how I’m doing
[0:00:34] <+Jiggisnipe> big divisions
[0:00:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> spicy takes
[0:00:38] <Treasure_Vault> Smells bigly?
[0:00:39] <xerotwo> HERE WE GO AGAIN
[0:00:42] <vstpnv> yeah that's how matrix 4 is gonna go
[0:00:43] <+mattiabh> @oneimportantthing yeah same
[0:00:49] <brunoberserk> BRING ON THE FIGHTS
[0:00:52] <Puhff> whouda thunk
[0:00:57] <badguy8312> guess we'll have to watch the podcast
[0:00:58] <%leith_aziz> I hope chat keeps it civil. Speaking as an outsider
[0:01:00] <Bonebagmel> Ok, who's gonna tell them about the nft fighting game
[0:01:01] <%romulux420> I am on the woolie side of things matrixwise
[0:01:09] <huskarl_zap> Do you hear it? Ahhhh the song of midnight.
[0:01:10] <+TheAmazingNick> Some people like bad movies and that is fine, but they love to argue
[0:01:13] <%Deekman> The Matrix is a series like Shenmue. Every movie is 25% worse than the last
[0:01:14] <%Theycallmenerf> @bonebagmel You’re kidding
[0:01:17] <miucsa51> @bonebagmel WUT?
[0:01:30] <Puhff> And all because Lana Wachowski has dreads Keepo
[0:01:30] <@Menitta> I'm surprised because it seems so middling. like I could see people going it was alright or it was not great but I'm surprised there are extremes on the movie.
[0:01:30] <+Jiggisnipe> do people love it or is it moreso it's fine?
[0:01:45] <%Irridium> @Bonebagmel the one that was selling itself on having thousands of characters then wiped it all clean and took off with everyone's money?
[0:01:47] <+TopTieramisu> @Deekman are you implying shenmue 3 is only 25% worse than 2?
[0:01:56] <@Solidus_113> but that doesn't make it okay
[0:01:58] <+TheAmazingNick> just because it acknowledges it is bad does not make it not bad
[0:01:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> so deep
[0:02:06] <Reveresao> Reggie really needs to dye his hair white for Halloween. He looking motivated.
[0:02:09] <%Deekman> @TopTieramisu Yes, and 50% worse than Shenmue 1
[0:02:20] <%leith_aziz> Speaking as an outsider, you can enjoy a movie/game with MANY faults if you want to focus on the positives that are there. I dont wanna spark any debates. Like I've said, I havent seen the movie
[0:02:22] <+TopTieramisu> that's not how percentages work...
[0:02:29] <+Jiggisnipe> so it's bad on purpose?
[0:02:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> a critique of modern media "stop this please"
[0:02:37] <badguy8312> I read a review where it said it was more a rejection of the idea of what a regular person thinks The Matrix is about
[0:02:38] <Bonebagmel> look for NiftyApeNation on twitter, for the NFT fighting game.  yes, it's exactly what you think.
[0:02:41] <fatalDestiny> Lamp shading a mediocre movie doesn't make it a good movie,
[0:02:44] <DSD24> Is Woolie talking about The Matrix?
[0:02:51] <+Mekhet09> Yeah, but that would make WB money.
[0:02:51] <Reveresao> yea
[0:02:54] <%seydaq> just becauss you say something is gonna be awful dont mean its an excuse
[0:02:55] <%JetpackMcQuack> i gotta see this movie
[0:02:56] <%ohkayNiko> okay but... saying "hey we know this is a cashgrab" then proceeding to make a cashgrab doesn't make it good
[0:02:58] <%Theycallmenerf> @fataldestiny Facts
[0:03:01] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus did you see the after credits scene?
[0:03:02] <%ohkayNiko> people are fucking dumb LUL
[0:03:04] <%Irridium> on the other hand if they did they'd probably have to keep making sequels
[0:03:25] <DSD24> Comic Sans! is the best font in the world
[0:03:25] <XelanArdel> galaxy brain, make a bad movie so they dont make more sequels
[0:03:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:03:33] <badguy8312> uhhhh, comique sans you mean? @woolieversus
[0:03:34] <+TheAmazingNick> Bad movie aside, I did not expect Reggie to take a look at a souls-like in the early stages of his Souls journey
[0:03:38] <%JetpackMcQuack> it's to ...disarm you?
[0:03:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Ressurection cannot be worst then Revolution..........my famous last words
[0:03:44] <%seydaq> could be a forest gump 2 situation
[0:03:47] <@Menitta> When the movie goes "This is awful huh" I'm just going to agree.
[0:03:52] <+mattiabh> damn, that's a bummer
[0:03:53] <ken_kuma> What's good, people?
[0:03:55] <Jerp> yikes
[0:03:59] <+Mekhet09> @WoolieVersus Yeah but she doesn't want to make more.
[0:04:15] <%Theycallmenerf> Did Matrix get Disney Star Wars’d?
[0:04:16] <%fearlesscoward9> fearlesscoward9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! I want someone to mortal my shell ayy yo
[0:04:18] <+vaderxyz1970> I just don't like the movie because it shouldn't exist
[0:04:19] <%leith_aziz> @morcego_cinzento_arts Considering "everything Greqat about Matrix Revolutions" exist, I'll have to disagree with you
[0:04:25] <badguy8312> so it's a singular Wachowski sister now?
[0:04:29] <%Deekman> This felt like an epilogue
[0:04:31] <yukichocomilk> I'd never make bad work just to make a point. still make it good
[0:04:32] <%Prevot> real talk, the wachowskis never made anything worthwhile after Matrix 1
[0:04:42] <DSD24> @Prevot Speed Racer was good tho
[0:04:43] <%livlinn> Hellllo PrideRise
[0:04:48] <badguy8312> @prevot didn't they do speed racer?
[0:04:51] <+TheAmazingNick> Might be a case of "we will do it with or without you" and you just bang out a script out of spite
[0:04:55] <%Irridium> @Prevot I liked Cloud Atlas, in spite of the yellowface
[0:04:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @leith_aziz fair
[0:04:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> @badguy8312 ye they did Speed Racer
[0:05:05] <%leith_aziz> The biggest importance for a product is that I hope the person was passionate and enjoyed making it
[0:05:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> you aren't actually trinity
[0:05:22] <+Mekhet09> What was the budget on the movie?
[0:05:27] <%leith_aziz> It can be the worst if making it was soley corporate reasons
[0:05:32] <%Theycallmenerf> Matrix should’ve stopped after Matrix.
[0:05:37] <Rionxgarland> is this a new chapter of reggarth
[0:05:57] <%seydaq> speed racer was aight. bitterShrug
[0:05:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp
[0:06:00] <Archmortal> hot take, it's as good or better than the original
[0:06:00] <Jerp> haven't seen Matrix 4 and wasn't really dying to see it but now it feels like something that, if I watched it, it would be at the risk of diminishing what I liked about the first movie
[0:06:02] <%Prevot> maybe they should have made a youtube video essay about Matrix instead of a new movie LUL
[0:06:02] <%Theycallmenerf> Reggarth’s weird dream: Mortal Shell
[0:06:03] <badguy8312> @woolieversus do you think Hideaki Anno woukdve made it better???
[0:06:03] <@Solidus_113> it keeps happening
[0:06:11] <xerotwo> STUNLOCKED
[0:06:11] <@Menitta> not again lol
[0:06:12] <DSD24> The block stun
[0:06:15] <+HollowMan190> still talking  about Matrix
[0:06:21] <%seydaq> woolieSPICE poise!
[0:06:21] <stranger59> Sets Matrix up as a MUCH better tabletop rpg than it ever was before.
[0:06:23] <%Deekman> the merovingian was the moment I fell off
[0:06:25] <%Theycallmenerf> You did not block, you are now stunned.
[0:06:28] <xerotwo> doodDodge doodDodge doodDodge
[0:06:32] <%Hapsam> stuck in a loop
[0:06:32] <+Mekhet09> Your take isn't the problem imo.
[0:06:38] <+letshavecakes> aaaaaaaa
[0:06:38] <%livlinn> Who’s going to play today? woolieSPICE woolieKICKDAD
[0:06:41] <stranger59> No games! Only Matrix talk!
[0:06:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> well it's going better than Pat's thread
[0:06:43] <oneimportantthing> Mortal Shell might get better but I was immediately hit by "we have Dark Souls at home" lol
[0:06:43] <@Menitta> So what do you think about Rollback Netcode
[0:06:43] <xerotwo> doodDodge doodDodge doodDodge doodDodge
[0:06:44] <%leith_aziz> @Jerp I dont think that should ever be a thing. Nothing outside of teh product itself should hamper teh quality of soemthing taht already exists and taht you enjoyed
[0:06:47] <@Solidus_113> I told you about the matrix bro
[0:06:52] <xerotwo> LMAO ROLLBACK
[0:06:59] <badguy8312> ex dp like your life depends on it woolie, they'll drop the combo eventually
[0:07:01] <%Theycallmenerf> ROLLBACK MATRIX
[0:07:03] <%ohkayNiko> @oneimportantthing LUL my thoughts exactly
[0:07:15] <Jerp> leith_aziz yeah, but it's mostly that I would be stuck in an eternal loop of "this reminds me of how bad the 4th movie was"
[0:07:20] <fanciful_fright> So the issue is that others think bad movie is good because its bad on purpose? I dunno, bad seems bad.
[0:07:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the Matrix into Rollback combo is pretty effective it seems
[0:07:24] <+HollowMan190> You should  talk to Raco from Maga 65
[0:07:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> I'll pick your brain
[0:07:28] <%seydaq> but did you consider the unreal engine money LUL
[0:07:28] <+HollowMan190> 65
[0:07:31] <stranger59> I'll do that talk with you about TLJ, which I LOVE, but... I only liked Resurrections.
[0:07:32] <DSD24> I liked the movie but the old footage keep getting spliced in was annoying
[0:07:36] <%Theycallmenerf> Manga 65?
[0:07:36] <Archmortal> what if you're wrong and shoddy is not in fact what it is though
[0:07:42] <+HollowMan190> 64.....
[0:07:43] <%leith_aziz> I cant help but feel that discussing this at all will get drowned in negativity, which makes me ask the question "what's the poin of this again?"
[0:07:49] <morcego_cinzento_arts> so the problem of Ressurection is solid script fucked by cringe performance and bad choreography
[0:07:50] <badguy8312> Maga '64 baby
[0:07:53] <Archmortal> cuz I feel like I'm listening to someone say Keanu Reeves is a bad actor
[0:07:57] <%Theycallmenerf> The Room
[0:07:59] <%leith_aziz> Unless you're going for bad acting intentionally pickySmug
[0:08:02] <Jerp> leith_aziz -- I've been having the same issue with star wars after TFA/etc.
[0:08:02] <%Theycallmenerf> Oh hi Neo
[0:08:09] <tolloponik> if a movie is bad just say its bad if they like it that's fine but if they want you to change your opinion on it being bat just tell them to piss off
[0:08:09] <+Orcapugs> No more heroes Matrix.
[0:08:11] <%JetpackMcQuack> monkaS
[0:08:13] <miucsa51> IRONIC shitposting still shitposting
[0:08:16] <+mattiabh> ok that sounds cool
[0:08:17] <%leith_aziz> I did not hit her, I did NOT
[0:08:25] <+TheMilkiestShake> I started watching Midnight Mass and felt the same about the acting
[0:08:39] <NkoPunch> "Do you you remember the MATRIX kid?
[0:08:42] <%Hapsam> Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.
[0:08:49] <brunoberserk> mr andeRSOOOOOOOOOOON
[0:08:51] <+Golgottha> Don't let pretentious psuedo intellectuals try and tell you your opinion sucks. Matrix 4 objectively was a bad movie Wollie
[0:08:51] <Archmortal> It's okay to be wrong, Woolie
[0:08:52] <+Jiggisnipe> Jebaited
[0:08:54] <%Theycallmenerf> I was with it, now it I’m not. It’ll happen to you
[0:08:58] <DSD24> Oh god
[0:09:01] <%seydaq> @orcapugs LUL, no more heroes badman edition
[0:09:01] <DSD24> That's so bad
[0:09:07] <Jerp> actually, I also had the issue with MIB2 with the switch to being super cartoony rather than mostly serious in the first movie
[0:09:09] <%leith_aziz> @tolloponik That seems a bit hostile. Sometimes there's something you genuinely like, but you know there's a norm of people considering it trash without really considering why
[0:09:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is that by design or because it was missed?
[0:09:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Dread does that
[0:09:20] <+mattiabh> early tomb raider games do that, especially if you miss secrets
[0:09:21] <stranger59> What was a poor performance? Jada Pinkett Smith as an 80+ year old?
[0:09:24] <@Solidus_113> 2014
[0:09:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> until you get the update

[0:10:43] <youngking_kush> No Reggie you stop that tight now
[0:10:45] <%Deekman> they did add rollback, they rolled back every creative decision from the 3rd
[0:10:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Solidus_113 Dead Space actually doesnt give you ammo for guns you dont have yet, but if you buy one and sell it later, you'll still encounter the ammo

[0:11:37] <%Irridium> oh god i actually stunlocked him my bad
[0:11:37] <+Jiggisnipe> I think she looks cool
[0:11:41] <%Theycallmenerf> Stunlocked needs to be a new emote
[0:11:41] <youngking_kush> It's so tough to not like things that racist incels also dont like
[0:11:44] <DSD24> We playing Marvel?
[0:11:45] <Jerp> people will fight you to try to get you to enjoy the thing they liked as if it needs to be that way for their own validation
[0:11:45] <+DatAsuna> easy way to trigger a certain subset of the right lol
[0:11:46] <Arqartur0> So, the matrix 4 made the other three better, by being the foundation?
[0:11:50] <xerotwo> STUNLOCK
[0:11:52] <+Rofos07> stun block
[0:11:53] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Solidus_113 there's actually an ammo type for a gun in DS2 that people will buy and then sell so they can sell the ammo for it and it gives some hefty credits
[0:11:54] <Dakuu75> the final blue straw
[0:11:57] <+bluetocho13> isnt that where the woke concept came from
[0:12:01] <+TopTieramisu> woolie's in the matrix blender
[0:12:01] <%Theycallmenerf> !STUN!
[0:12:02] <+TheAmazingNick> That movie is a lot of things. That is not one of them :D
[0:12:04] <+theoldone001> Mortal Shell is one of the best Souls likes, I enjoyed it
[0:12:07] <%badguy8312> @woolieversus republicans saying Rage Against the Machine became too political during Trump campaign
[0:12:12] <+DatAsuna> dyed dreads? smh this stream is so woke
[0:12:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> Maybe debates are dogshit
[0:12:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @badguy8312 lmao
[0:12:18] <+unlocked2886> They complain about being "WOKE," yet make repeated pleas to, "WAKE UP, SHEEPLE." Curious.
[0:12:18] <DSD24> This is the best
[0:12:19] <%leith_aziz> My judgment with quality will probably be scarred forever by enjoying GG lore and knowing other people enjoy it. Me liking that but hating other movies/games considered bad makes me so confused
[0:12:20] <+Jiggisnipe> He can't stop himself LUL
[0:12:21] <@Solidus_113> IT KEEPS HAPPENING
[0:12:21] <youngking_kush> @bluetocho13 No, not at all. They co-opted it
[0:12:23] <+Mekhet09> @WoolieVersus I'll be honest, my real issue is pat's take from not knowing anything about matrix 4.
[0:12:25] <haisho> You cannot escape the stunlock!
[0:12:27] <stranger59> Can the stunlocked emote just be Neo?
[0:12:27] <BlackermanZX> ya need a stunlocked emote or sumthin
[0:12:27] <Afrosamasenpai> you gotta alpha counter!

[0:14:29] <DSD24> The Surge
[0:14:30] <Archmortal> becoming?  It has already fully become
[0:14:34] <Rupy100> Hey guys. When's the next Silent hill stream? the first one was really hype and I was having a great time!
[0:14:39] <%Theycallmenerf> @stranger59 Yeah, maybe that mmo shouldn’t have happened.
[0:14:41] <haisho> Reggie has been properly baptized in the fires of Dark Souls
[0:14:41] <DSD24> Surge 2 was good
[0:14:44] <kes009900> is reggie playing this?
[0:14:44] <JoshManVGH> Yeyeye! I tried to play this and I was SO BAD at it! And I'm still so bad at it, looking forward to learning some good strats
[0:14:45] <+Mekhet09> Man, I hated the surge.
[0:14:48] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @rupy100 thurs
[0:14:48] <youngking_kush> Theres Anime Souls as well
[0:14:50] <@Menitta> Surge 2 is cool
[0:14:50] <+Jiggisnipe> @Rupy100 Thursday
[0:14:52] <srv4254> lords of the fallen code vein surge all turds
[0:14:56] <+theoldone001> This and the Surge 2 were the better Souls likes
[0:14:59] <%paladinstarbuster> Surge 2 was pretty dese
[0:15:02] <%Prevot> this game rips off DS super hard, down to UI design, but somehow they didn't copy the best DS mechanic, the Estus Flask
[0:15:02] <BlackermanZX> Mortal Shell is pretty much diet souls
[0:15:03] <Arqartur0> BTW fam, the season Jojo in which there is a killer in Moriocho is it Battle Tendencies, or is it still Diamond is Unbreakable?
[0:15:06] <stranger59> @Theycallmenerf They should make another MMO to bring him back!
[0:15:07] <Justlaxy> egs ate it up
[0:15:09] <%Indigo_Automaton> It got a big update a while back
[0:15:11] <%Theycallmenerf> Souls like? hollow Knight? Blasphemous?
[0:15:12] <+Mekhet09> I also hated the surge 2. Mostly because where to go is so unclear I got lost.
[0:15:13] <+TheAmazingNick> I forgot about Code Vein. Great character creator. That was about it for me though
[0:15:15] <BlackermanZX> its pretty cool
[0:15:17] <+meermadon> Didn't like this game at all tbh
[0:15:20] <Rupy100> Big thanks guys
[0:15:22] <DSD24> Code Vein was really fun
[0:15:27] <youngking_kush> @theamazingnick Code Vein, that's the one
[0:15:27] <+theoldone001> Nioh 2 feels way too repetitive and bloated to me, the lack of a level design kills it for me too
[0:15:28] <mikesapartment> i hate this game but im lookin' forward to this one
[0:15:35] <Treasure_Vault> Code Vein was fun but forgettable.
[0:15:36] <%ekodrop> jank souls
[0:15:37] <JoshManVGH> Has Reggie ever played Anime Dark Souls?
[0:15:38] <neowave607> The Surge is Darksouls, but you attach a bunch of trash and shit to your body until you resemble a Bayformer.
[0:15:44] <theanora1> oh I want to see a pro play this game
[0:15:45] <@Menitta> Code Vein had a better character creator than game LUL
[0:15:46] <%Theycallmenerf> Is this Slav Souls?
[0:15:58] <donstylo> The Surge 2 has a very good system to optain new items.
[0:16:01] <+jakeywinklebuns> Still going through Reggie VS dark souls on youtube, very proud of that titanite pole damage Reg
[0:16:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> does Hollowknight counts?
[0:16:03] <%diegobandzz> Mortal shells battle system is interesting at least
[0:16:04] <youngking_kush> @theoldone001 Nioh 2 doesnt lack level design, it's actually a lot better than Nioh 1. It's just mission based
[0:16:05] <%slimmixrp> Is this a reggie VS
[0:16:11] <%badguy8312> Hey it's me, The Amazon Bomber from the Catacombs in DS1.

[0:21:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> bro
[0:21:55] <haisho> the hilts are pointed so the sword can be used as a makeshift warpick to pierce armor
[0:21:59] <%leith_aziz> Dont tell me how to live, game pickyThink
[0:22:02] <Arqartur0> Grabbing it to strike with the hit made for an improptu warhammer
[0:22:03] <morcego_cinzento_arts> they did against metal plated armoured knights
[0:22:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> put holes in stuff
[0:22:08] <haisho> or a mace I'm not too familiar
[0:22:09] <technodribble> The Crossguard strike was used to pierce armor that a blade couldn't
[0:22:10] <+thegamekirby98> This hardening mechanic reminds me of that minigame from Pokemon Stadium with the metapods
[0:22:10] <%trackles_64> is reggie playing?
[0:22:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jasek7 If you wore gauntlets or chainmail you'd be pretty safe grabbing the blade.
[0:22:12] <Louie_Salmon> The hardening mechanic rocks
[0:22:15] <%Deekman> Can you harden while inside someone to increase damage?

[0:22:41] <+セビー> idk if i can call this soulslike.. its like.. souls adjacent
[0:22:48] <%hax_metatron> If you harden at the end of a thrust attack, when you come out of that attack it does another thrust attack. You can do many interesting combos this way
[0:22:49] <Earthun> this dude needs to eat sum soup

[0:23:02] <+twohitgood> @セビー it's more soulslike than something like nioh.
[0:23:06] <%trackles_64> say mortal again
[0:23:06] <stranger59> Your warframes?
[0:23:14] <%paladinstarbuster> I like rock man more than jerky man

[0:23:38] <+セビー> @twohitgood true, true
[0:23:42] <%Deekman> @Reverend_Roscoe lmao I felt the response coming as soon as I typed it lmao
[0:23:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yo these animations are pretty good
[0:23:48] <%CafecitoGaming> The shells are more just health/Stamina archetypes
[0:23:52] <%leith_aziz> pickyFight
[0:23:53] <%trackles_64> kick his ass
[0:23:53] <DSD24> Yo we in there
[0:23:58] <WG101> i thought that dude's name was Hardern
[0:24:00] <stranger59> Hadern vs. Harder
[0:24:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> get it, it's like Harden
[0:24:04] <%trackles_64> where the boss music?
[0:24:05] <donstylo> The Shell is similar to the Bloodcodes from Code Vein it's basically a Loadout with a skilltree.
[0:24:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> but wrong
[0:24:08] <+TheAmazingNick> Haden used Harden
[0:24:08] <%Deekman> Go Rock Hardman!\
[0:24:12] <+TopTieramisu> harden vs hadern
[0:24:12] <DSD24> Bonk
[0:24:13] <JoshManVGH> He has your powers, he can also Get Hard!
[0:24:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ermehged MurtalShull
[0:24:21] <%Reverend_Roscoe> boop
[0:24:21] <%leith_aziz> @trackles_64 I dont..think the game has music for teh most part
[0:24:26] <Louie_Salmon> Hardening mid-combo is a lot of fun, it basically makes everything safe as long as you can harden on reaction.
[0:24:30] <Josef_Stryker> You can take him
[0:24:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:24:32] <Josef_Stryker> Kappa
[0:24:33] <stranger59> He's getting hard on you!
[0:24:36] <delightmare_> I missed the intro, did Woolie already play this?
[0:24:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Why is there no music?
[0:24:40] <%seydaq> what happens if you harden in air
[0:24:49] <glass_marcus> Is this genichiro?
[0:24:55] <PartialRecall1> finally a game where i can harden
[0:24:57] <zzNamttamzz> Harden anagram NotLikeThis
[0:24:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @seydaq Kappa
[0:25:00] <oda_flobunaga> @BallerSwagBro9k there isn't any
[0:25:01] <DSD24> Instead of music this sounds like just ambience
[0:25:01] <yukichocomilk> HARD BOYS
[0:25:02] <%leith_aziz> Again, feel free to correct me, but im fairly certain teh game doesnt have music
[0:25:03] <%CafecitoGaming> @delightmare_ tried it but just for a feel
[0:25:05] <Louie_Salmon> I had a solid guffaw when I read this guy's name
[0:25:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Metapod vs Metapod!
[0:25:12] <%badguy8312> now THATS a zweihander
[0:25:13] <%Theycallmenerf> Change the boss name to Harder
[0:25:14] <+TheAmazingNick> the soundtrack is just Gregorian chants. We might need some Rotting Christ
[0:25:20] <@Menitta> This looks quite fun
[0:25:22] <Hellvis92> is the game audio weird only for me?
[0:25:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @commandersqueaks lol
[0:25:41] <%seydaq> not the mind in the gutter way @ballerswagbro9k spyCappa
[0:25:45] <%leith_aziz> pickyFocus
[0:25:47] <delightmare_> @CafecitoGaming thank you
[0:25:48] <+warlockwithapixie> audio is fine for me
[0:25:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> This brings a whole new meaning to "Hard Read"
[0:25:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The lack of music is really jarring after the epic haunting vocals of DS
[0:25:50] <PartialRecall1> oh its aan anagram for harden i get it :)
[0:25:57] <+TopTieramisu> outhardened
[0:25:57] <%Hapsam> i wanted to ask the same, does the game just sound like its getting picked up by a webcam?
[0:25:58] <nailwind> they turned a typo into a boss name
[0:26:01] <+theoldone001> Who's playing it? Woolie?
[0:26:06] <+MightyDuckShoes> ESTUS
[0:26:10] <%trackles_64> no u can beat him

[0:26:16] <+mechslayer71> woolie yeah
[0:26:19] <%Fetrigon> BACKDOWN
[0:26:21] <%SveriSageAdvice> Even if Woolie loses, this is the most impressive first go at Hadern i've seen
[0:26:25] <PartialRecall1> Detroit: Become Hard
[0:26:28] <%RemedyofRevenge> game over YEAH

[0:26:48] <Johannen> Moroeu?
[0:26:52] <JoshManVGH> Did a good showing of it
[0:26:52] <%Prevot> need to upgrade your refractory period so you can harden more often
[0:26:56] <Arqartur0> "Get back here when you are harder"
[0:26:58] <+TopTieramisu> morduga?
[0:27:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IS THIS SOUL STRANDING?

[0:34:31] <%patriotrenegade> DAMN
[0:34:34] <otakon17> and there it is
[0:34:34] <%dds333a> Debiruman
[0:34:42] <Arqartur0> Truth be told, the battlefields of old WERE full of music: Drums, the occasional Flutes, bagpipes...

[0:34:53] <otakon17> oh yeah watch out for fatass frogs, they not nice

[0:35:12] <nailwind> hobo with the power walk
[0:35:14] <+TheAmazingNick> The camera and look remind me a lot of the Bluepoint DS
[0:35:14] <zzNamttamzz> Watch your toes LUL
[0:35:24] <%dds333a> LUL
[0:35:31] <cartakus> It's awesome from the devs to release the dlc for free to people that bough the game
[0:35:39] <%seydaq> @arqartur0 the drums of war are always sick
[0:35:50] <+ThePich> this looks very floaty
[0:35:55] <DSD24> Wow litterer
[0:36:05] <+theoldone001> Did they change the enemy placement? Looks a little different since the last time I played it.
[0:36:10] <zzNamttamzz> Ow

[0:36:44] <derap41> What's with the sound
[0:36:47] <+TheAmazingNick> Toss a coin to your shell
[0:36:55] <stranger59> Can you harden while playing the lute?
[0:36:56] <KaseKaizer> FeelsBadMan
[0:36:57] <Carlioo> stop killing djs
[0:37:00] <churropoppa> @ThePich it doesn't feel floaty. you can feel a sense of weight when playing
[0:37:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> he's tuning
[0:37:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> Let's gooooooo!!!
[0:37:04] <PartialRecall1> i wonder if these mortal shells contain some kind of ...dark souls?
[0:37:06] <+セビー> so this game starts in stinky swamp.. bold move
[0:37:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> Just finished work
[0:37:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @stranger59 yes during fire solos
[0:37:16] <%dds333a> @carlioo can I hang then instead?
[0:37:22] <+ArcanumArcanum> does the game audio sound underwater to anyone else?
[0:37:27] <%CafecitoGaming> @ThePich yeah it's actually very grounded somewhat realistic swings
[0:37:34] <stranger59> @BallerSwagBro9k Niiiice
[0:37:38] <%leith_aziz> What are ya doing in ma SWAMP?! pickyAngy
[0:37:41] <cartakus> So any preference towards shells and weapons?
[0:37:47] <%Hapsam> its very strange sound-design, like there is a filter for the high ends
[0:37:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Okay, but where's the lute, tho?
[0:37:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> RAT FLASK
[0:38:07] <otakon17> he's got the lute
[0:38:09] <%seydaq> does a hema technique, still twirls in armour bitterUngo
[0:38:12] <otakon17> just hasn't played it a bunch yet
[0:38:14] <%Prevot> DS2 healing items, yaaaay NotLikeThis
[0:38:17] <otakon17> >don't get hit

[0:38:33] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Prevot oh, have you not seen this before? Items isn't how you heal
[0:38:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1475753733116076034?t=xDYBW5uS1mTPmSfuKiU8Qg&s=19
[0:38:42] <cheapdoc> Woolie, I don't even know what the recovery item looks like, Madden
[0:38:46] <BettyMwwaahh> oh yea that was a really big negative for me. no Estus-like system
[0:38:52] <%paladinstarbuster> @seydaq a little style is fair when yo can harden
[0:38:57] <derap41> Gotta eat it twice too
[0:39:02] <cartakus> You can get a bunch of mushrooms IF you know where to go
[0:39:02] <+twohitgood> item effects change as you gain familiarity, btw.
[0:39:08] <%hax_metatron> Keep using this one, even though it poisons you.
[0:39:16] <%paladinstarbuster> oh shit trippin balls
[0:39:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's WAIF
[0:39:21] <%CafecitoGaming> That's cool though because you can get poison resistance if you eat it enough
[0:39:21] <DSD24> Foundling is a lame name
[0:39:22] <otakon17> and now you have found your Maiden
[0:39:24] <derap41> Come seek seek lest
[0:39:24] <%dds333a> sure
[0:39:26] <%hax_metatron> If you use that item enough, eventually you can’t get poisoned by anything else
[0:39:30] <%seydaq> @paladinstarbuster LUL fair point
[0:39:34] <%patriotrenegade> or a SLEEVE
[0:39:41] <DSD24> Stop saying sleeve
[0:39:42] <%Vigonept> a MORTAL SHELL maybe
[0:39:46] <%king_wragles> Wait... are you playing as a SKINWALKER?
[0:39:55] <Carlioo> "senseless muttering" lol
[0:39:55] <+ArcanumArcanum> I just pulled up another Mortal Shell stream and the game audio doesn't sound as muffled as woolie's. So I think something is up with his audio
[0:39:56] <brunoberserk> a nomad soul ??
[0:39:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hi mommy, sorry mommy, sorry mommy, sorry.....
[0:39:57] <+NeddTheNerd> monkaS

[0:40:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @king_wragles no
[0:40:14] <%Vigonept> so shells are classes
[0:40:20] <otakon17> you do not level up so much as unlock perks for the shells

[0:41:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> Yo cool
[0:41:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> You want to max out familiarity with EVERYTHING
[0:41:26] <nailwind> PogChamp
[0:41:27] <otakon17> yeah all the items get bonus affects as max mastery
[0:41:34] <%king_wragles> no I'm thinking about it, that's a skinwalker
[0:41:38] <otakon17> like the healing stuff does 60hp over 30 seconds
[0:41:45] <%king_wragles> or a body snatcher
[0:41:48] <otakon17> locations of more shells
[0:41:51] <derap41> is the volume set up right? it feels like its being recorded in a room
[0:41:53] <brunoberserk> drink poison to cure poison ... WAIT
[0:41:53] <%king_wragles> Either way this game is good, you guys should play it
[0:41:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> @king_wragles not a body snatcher because shells are all dead
[0:41:58] <otakon17> that's the BIG BOY shell
[0:42:01] <%seydaq> yeah, the shaka zulu method. eat this poison kids spyCappa

[0:42:50] <%Prevot> get into that nice moist sleeve, like it's preggers and you're the baby
[0:42:53] <%CafecitoGaming> I will say too Woolie, that every consumable is on a timer. Which might get annoying when you want to stockpile some health items.
[0:43:02] <%badguy8312> can I borrow Woolie's sleeve after he's done?
[0:43:03] <%seydaq> a sleeve is just a larger pocket

[0:51:57] <%CafecitoGaming> Tar is a semi difficult resource to obtained

[0:55:43] <KaseKaizer> Parry is your estus PogBones
[0:55:45] <%dds333a> went around his shoulder on that one
[0:55:45] <Slothjoe> this looks janky
[0:55:53] <derap41> no more roasted rats for us
[0:55:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ummmmm does the game sound like it's coming through their mics for anyone?
[0:55:57] <%holydeviant1> that death wheeze still isnt as useful as Souls' soft "sshnk"
[0:55:58] <%Prevot> it's VERY janky
[0:56:05] <oneimportantthing> Big "We have Dark Souls at home" energy
[0:56:11] <%dds333a> big swing
[0:56:14] <%seydaq> zandatsu
[0:56:15] <zhenthrim213> @Slothjoe good just like all souls games
[0:56:19] <+セビー> but.. rat..
[0:56:20] <%dds333a> and the notes LUL
[0:56:22] <Slothjoe> Kinda reminds me of Lords of the Fallen
[0:56:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the parry timing seems pretty generous
[0:56:30] <+theoldone001> It's kinda jank, but it's actually fun and the Shell concept with Harden is pretty fun.
[0:56:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> No you don't,
[0:56:50] <%hax_metatron> You don’t
[0:57:06] <oda_flobunaga> Harden trivializes everything once you understand how to use it
[0:57:06] <%hax_metatron> You have to gain resolve by keeping on fighting, or using some items
[0:57:07] <+warlockwithapixie> uh?
[0:57:16] <%Hapsam> I checked some other videos on youtube and the sound seems off here.
[0:57:16] <nailwind> rolling over to stare at the heavens, poor man
[0:57:16] <%Prevot> get used to enemies phasing in 3 meters in front of you
[0:57:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> Resolve is a meter that builds on hits. And if you stop hitting for X seconds... it drains down if incomplete.
[0:57:23] <derap41> it goes up when you hit enemies
[0:57:24] <%CafecitoGaming> @Prevot I don't know if it's technically janky or real strict rather. Like you don't have a drop down attack so his attempt at that  makeshift one didn't hit
[0:57:28] <+TheAmazingNick> The parry fills you with determination
[0:57:33] <oneimportantthing> Man I really wanted a character creator in this
[0:57:39] <%hax_metatron> The resolve is required for riposte
[0:57:41] <%CafecitoGaming> Stockpile those resolves
[0:57:45] <%CafecitoGaming> for bosses
[0:57:53] <%dds333a> don't fall for it Kappa
[0:57:55] <+ikantreeed> ayo
[0:58:03] <+ikantreeed> who's playing? ool or reg?

[0:58:08] <+ikantreeed> wool*
[0:58:09] <%dds333a> Woolz
[0:58:27] <oneimportantthing> It's when you play games like this that you realise Dark Souls 2 is actually excellent
[0:58:52] <+ikantreeed> I'm abot to star ds2 soon...first i need to beat kalameet in ds1...
[0:58:54] <%Indigo_Automaton> X
[0:59:01] <%CafecitoGaming> @oneimportantthing be my friend you're the only other person to ever say a nice thing about DS2 lol
[0:59:02] <+ThePich> lmao that animation
[0:59:04] <kulmoth> hot take, dark souls 2 is over-hated
[0:59:07] <SuspiciousWaffler> SuspiciousWaffler subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:59:11] <+セビー> being the ‘worst dark souls’ isnt the insult ppl think it is
[0:59:12] <nailwind> dark souls 2 is the benchmark test to pass
[0:59:13] <%dds333a> Wakanda Forever
[0:59:24] <+TheAmazingNick> @ikantreeed did you get inspired by Reggies LP?
[0:59:26] <+ikantreeed> Is ds2 harder than ds1?
[0:59:27] <+wanzerfaust> @ThePich It's very Attitude Era WWE.
[0:59:27] <TheyCallMeVawn> DS2 is the funnest to replay for me
[0:59:28] <oneimportantthing> @cafecitogaming I will always die on the hill that DS2 is better than DS3
[0:59:30] <%Indigo_Automaton> He's doing that one arm-blade mall ninja pose
[0:59:31] <vampiresintwilightsparkle> Kalameet is dragondese
[0:59:40] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:59:40] <%dds333a> @ikantreeed in some ways, yes
[0:59:42] <%Prevot> @ikantreeed DS2 is the hardest souls game, by far
[1:00:03] <%seydaq> ds2 aint bad. good if youre a pvper, bad if you like lore
[1:00:05] <+セビー> but those build varieties in 2.. *chef kiss*
[1:00:12] <nailwind> i love how you can hear the strain in the voice LUL
[1:00:13] <%dds333a> There are zones in DS2, especially in the dlc, which are brutal
[1:00:18] <zhenthrim213> Darkest dungeon 2 like
[1:00:19] <%JetpackMcQuack> the ending
[1:00:20] <projectcapsule> @ikantreeed lol
[1:00:22] <TheyCallMeVawn> DS2 has the best lore of the trilogy
[1:00:23] <+ikantreeed> @TheAmazingNick partialy, i also wanna try and do those games before playing elden ring
[1:00:32] <brunoberserk> is kinda like nier weapon upgrades
[1:00:35] <%leith_aziz> @kulmoth hot take: people like to shit on something because it's the norm. Some dont judge for themselves. I dont play Souls games btw
[1:00:38] <oneimportantthing> DS3 has too much fanservice and kinda feels like reused Bloodborne assets
[1:00:40] <projectcapsule> jankiest =/= hardest
[1:00:48] <%CafecitoGaming> Yeah I did Demon Souls finally and now I wanna run through everything again
[1:00:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> look at all them forgs
[1:00:57] <%CafecitoGaming> @projectcapsule based.
[1:01:01] <%leith_aziz> Go ahead
[1:01:03] <oneimportantthing> Meanwhile DS2 has a very unique atmosphere and amazing build options
[1:01:03] <%Hapsam> Someone should probably tell Woolie that the recording sounds like from a mic or that the high frequencies arent getting picked up properly.
[1:01:05] <%patriotrenegade> thats a lot of frogs
[1:01:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> old man Kappa
[1:01:06] <+TheAmazingNick> @TheyCallMeVawn Hard disagree. Most of it is just "Remember DS1? This is kinda like it...but not really, but maybe it is?"
[1:01:07] <yukichocomilk> bathroom? how dare you
[1:01:10] <brunoberserk> mortal piss
[1:01:15] <+theoldone001> Barbarians at the gat!
[1:01:16] <%Prevot> @projectcapsule DS2 is hard AND also hard because of jank, kinda like Zelda 1

[1:02:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> lolathonGroove
[1:02:05] <otakon17> @ikantreeed they nerfed Faith abilities HARD in DKS2
[1:02:10] <%dds333a> @ikantreeed not trash, but nowhere near as other games
[1:02:10] <+セビー> faith casters suck in 2, but the support spells and scaled weapons are fine
[1:02:11] <%Bread_Assassin> People rag on Bed of Chaos (and rightfully so), but some of the optional bosses in the DLC are way worse.
[1:02:19] <Voidvas> Faith builds are always super rough early on.
[1:02:21] <nailwind> i rate souls games on how good it felt to play, so ds2 still bottom for me
[1:02:26] <%Bread_Assassin> For DS2 that is.
[1:02:31] <+mechslayer71> wait what happened, I left for a bit
[1:02:35] <otakon17> ds2 has that floaty animation when walking and attacking
[1:02:37] <%Prevot> let's be real here, when was Faith ever good in any of the 3 games?
[1:02:41] <+cgkonnor> @ikantreeed Most builds in DS2 are pretty solid except for bleed builds
[1:02:45] <otakon17> @mechslayer71 got the ability to parry and then Woolie had to pee
[1:02:49] <+UnrealStyrofoam> This song sounds great what is it ?
[1:02:56] <%seydaq> theyre on potty break
[1:03:01] <+mechslayer71> @otakon17 yeah i meant the break, thanks
[1:03:09] <Voidvas> Faith was alright in 3
[1:03:09] <otakon17> Chainsaw Funk 14 I think?
[1:03:10] <oneimportantthing> Somehow DS3 just felt less interesting, like the zones didn't get me interested, and Anor Londo was just that meme with the two guys pointing the whole time lol
[1:03:21] <+ikantreeed> frying chicken time
[1:03:46] <%seydaq> ah fanny pack

[1:03:56] <oneimportantthing> Also Majula > every other hub
[1:04:00] <+ikantreeed> char was never that roided
[1:04:03] <otakon17> Majula IS the best hub
[1:04:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Looked up the song OF COURSE ITS MELLO
[1:04:11] <+セビー> there was a bunch of course correction in 2, like pyro needing stats, and catalysts becoming upgradable
[1:04:12] <otakon17> the music alone cements this
[1:04:13] <+ThePich> ds3 looks amazing what are you on about
[1:04:14] <+TopTieramisu> ds3 is like the greatest hits of souls. so many of its moments were just borrowed from previous games
[1:04:14] <oneimportantthing> Ok I'll stop gushing about Ds2 now lmao
[1:04:18] <%dds333a> @bonebagmel only on that even comes close is hunters nigthtmare
[1:04:24] <otakon17> @TopTieramisu good way of putting it
[1:04:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MELLO DONT MISS
[1:04:24] <nailwind> holy hell Reggie looked amazing in that fanart 4 slides back
[1:04:27] <yukichocomilk> ds3's art direction is amazing
[1:04:29] <%dds333a> sorry @oneimportantthing
[1:04:32] <%kinetikpaws> oh shi
[1:04:37] <otakon17> suddenly Jenova theme
[1:04:45] <+ThePich> DS2 looks brown green half the time
[1:04:48] <%Bread_Assassin> DS2 did something amazing with Bonfire Ascetics and it's a real big shame they didn't carry it forward.
[1:04:52] <oneimportantthing> Boss fight pissing

[1:05:28] <+chvmpchange> i wish DS2 didn't have mostly trash bosses
[1:05:30] <%Prevot> @ThePich DS2 is somehow uglier than DeS and DS1
[1:05:31] <+ThePich> you shouldn't have to level up having a decent roll
[1:05:33] <%SuspiciousWaffler> yea ds2 is the only one I have yet to finish, is sotfs worth playing?
[1:05:36] <+TopTieramisu> manus is the best boss in ds1 for me
[1:05:40] <+ThePich> @SuspiciousWaffler no
[1:05:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @suspiciouswaffler yes
[1:05:43] <%patriotrenegade> Ds2 had the best fashion tho
[1:05:46] <+Byr0nX> sometime you gotta piss
[1:05:51] <%baka_sugoi> POOP
[1:05:52] <oneimportantthing> Man Majula is what I imagibe limbo to be like. A neverending sunset where you can slowly and comfortable fade away
[1:05:53] <%dds333a> have you?
[1:05:59] <+セビー> Sotfs doesnt fix anything you likely didnt like in the original
[1:05:59] <+wanzerfaust> Just noticed that the FFXIV Shiva theme does a similar thing to the Jenova theme with its opening "woosh" noise.
[1:06:01] <nailwind> sotfs makes everything worse but has the best character
[1:06:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> I've done a vibeo grane or two

[1:15:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oooh glimpses are shell specific? I think?
[1:15:29] <+twohitgood> different body, different glimpses
[1:15:31] <+theoldone001> They stay on the other shell
[1:15:32] <oneimportantthing> This game looks like it deserved a bigger budget
[1:15:32] <%CafecitoGaming> yup the glimpses belong to each shell
[1:15:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ahhh that prevents you from maximing out new shells right away
[1:16:10] <otakon17> eeyup
[1:16:17] <otakon17> Tar carries over, not Glimpses
[1:16:20] <%dds333a> @cobalt_phoenix_ right on the money
[1:16:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> Because upgrades cost Glimpses as well, so if you have 20k tar, you can't fully upgrade a Shell since it has 0 Glimpses.
[1:16:33] <%CafecitoGaming> @CappuccinoGuil yeah you have to earn everything here but if you already dedicate to one shell you're gonna be great regardless
[1:16:45] <%seydaq> a sword in a sword

[1:44:30] <%dds333a> that's reward
[1:44:35] <legacy0117> No just didn’t advertise as much as it could have.

[1:45:47] <+Tuffty> I think the most disappointing thing was that a few reviewers said the dungeons were Zelda inspired and that's so fucking untrue
[1:45:49] <SainEdge> @w_khan small game by a small team, takes like 15 hours for the first time. But New Game plus is a thing, plus there is a rouge lite mode

[2:04:14] <DXLelouch24> thats the games way of telling you to GFTO
[2:04:16] <crudjandall> I don't know what this is at all but as a souls fanatic I'm instantly intrigued!
[2:04:16] <MyNameIsRasus> donk donk donkl
[2:04:19] <%leith_aziz> BOP Vs BIGGER BOP
[2:04:23] <%RyTYoung> oh hi
[2:04:24] <%dds333a> girls are  watching woolz
[2:04:25] <DXLelouch24> GTFO*
[2:04:25] <%CafecitoGaming> This guy? he f**ks
[2:04:27] <+セビー> time to get flattened
[2:04:31] <MyNameIsRasus> cute hammer you got there
[2:04:32] <QueequegTheater> I'm sorry, that's not Vordt, it's fucking Velstadt
[2:04:35] <legacy0117> It’s mr shakedown.
[2:04:39] <T_Sasquatch> something about this game loosk both cool and jank , i reall wonder how it feels
[2:04:40] <%livlinn> not even a boss huh
[2:04:41] <%RyTYoung> omg
[2:04:42] <octotasty> So, this guy's a normal enemy?
[2:04:46] <legacy0117> Lol.
[2:04:46] <DXLelouch24> yes
[2:04:48] <Bonebagmel> he's got it
[2:04:52] <%dds333a> pattern
[2:04:52] <+TheAmazingNick> lol I forgot about Velstadt, like most DS2 bosses
[2:04:52] <%leith_aziz> pickyBonk pickyBonk pickyBonk
[2:05:01] <%leith_aziz> Hammer tantrum
[2:05:02] <Cobaltor_252> yeye abuse that ai
[2:05:05] <BlackermanZX> big boi downloaded
[2:05:05] <oda_flobunaga> There are maybe 5 bosses in here
[2:05:10] <%CafecitoGaming> He jacks his stack with both hands
[2:05:10] <slackerunchained> You've got him caught in your rythym, now...
[2:05:11] <%dds333a> downloaded
[2:05:16] <QueequegTheater> @TheAmazingNick How dare you, velstadt is the coolest
[2:05:18] <+mechslayer71> a lot of the enemies seem to use pretty limited move sets, with predictable and easy to avoid  responses
[2:05:20] <+Tuffty> This is where I came first after the woods and it's where I could see the limitations of the game. Big empty environments and they just have groups of enemies with huge health bars to slow progress.
[2:05:28] <+BelricPsytar> LUL
[2:05:29] <+warlockwithapixie> I love them actually
[2:05:31] <legacy0117> Oh Jade Knight can roll. Cool.
[2:05:32] <Afrosamasenpai> it die good
[2:05:35] <leomuratore> Things die dramatically
[2:05:35] <yukichocomilk> I LIKE THE WAY YOU DIE, BOY
[2:05:36] <zzNamttamzz> This is the toughest of the zones btw
[2:05:37] <%leith_aziz> I'll take "things I never expected to hear" for 5 bucks
[2:05:42] <srv4254> pretty good animation in general
[2:05:48] <%hax_metatron> Not good for your stamina I think
[2:05:51] <+TopTieramisu> it's a realistic hammer
[2:05:53] <snakemuho> @Tuffty yep, stopped fighting enemies here and through the rest of the game, no reason to
[2:05:55] <%CafecitoGaming> The upgrade gives it poison I wanna say
[2:05:56] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz watch django
[2:05:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah more stamina would probably be good
[2:05:58] <SainEdge> yeah this is the worst and hardest level
[2:06:02] <Bromosap1ens> bruh... vaping budder is insane. I'm not on this plane of existence anymore
[2:06:05] <QueequegTheater> DEX TANK DEX TANK
[2:06:09] <KaseKaizer> Celebrimbor style weapon
[2:06:09] <%dds333a> as in unchained LUL
[2:06:10] <%leith_aziz> pickyMunch
[2:06:24] <oda_flobunaga> visually speaking, this is the most interesting level
[2:06:45] <%CafecitoGaming> @oda_flobunaga It's cool if you have a fetish for onyx
[2:06:57] <%livlinn> lucidNom
[2:07:16] <+TopTieramisu> this guy be plunging
[2:07:20] <%dds333a> so he just does that if the player is too close
[2:07:20] <oda_flobunaga> floating rocks, what can I say
[2:07:23] <+mechslayer71> yeah this ai is dogshit
[2:07:26] <%Vigonept> is that all he can do?
[2:07:31] <%dds333a> if you're right up his ass
[2:07:32] <NaberiustheNefarious> he's pounding the mochi
[2:07:38] <+TopTieramisu> what a boss LUL
[2:07:38] <crudjandall> @cafecitogaming I was about to say it's not bad looking but it's kinda just soggy black rocks LUL
[2:07:38] <+ThePich> the enemies in this game seem very easily baitable
[2:07:53] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:07:53] <%Grimlockfly> that is some good character animation there....
[2:07:56] <KaseKaizer> 👇
[2:07:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Lute is your gesture
[2:07:59] <snakemuho> got a lute
[2:08:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can really start to see that this game was made by 4 people
[2:08:06] <legacy0117> Also being a 1 vs 1 specialist shell this fight is much more doable probably.
[2:08:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> The art design is fuckin sick as hell tho
[2:08:19] <crudjandall> okay this now instantly looks cooler
[2:08:23] <KaseKaizer> stripLurk
[2:08:24] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah..... oh yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2:08:25] <Cobaltor_252> Control Souls
[2:08:26] <%dds333a> woolieKICKDAD
[2:08:26] <crudjandall> I take it back
[2:08:27] <%trackles_64> end game?
[2:08:29] <+SmartAssPawn089> This is the cool area. THE cool area.
[2:08:39] <+vaderxyz1970> Roll up your windows
[2:08:42] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:08:44] <oda_flobunaga> The fire level is pretty good too
[2:08:47] <%livlinn> joofbLurk
[2:08:50] <%dds333a> unintentional speedrun? Kappa
[2:08:52] <+TheAmazingNick> So if you are good you can just run to the end game?
[2:08:59] <%trackles_64> fast travel?
[2:09:03] <snakemuho> @TheAmazingNick that's what I did LUL
[2:09:07] <oda_flobunaga> but this is the good one. its a shame the boss at the end is so stupid looking
[2:09:08] <huskarl_zap> it goes.deeper
[2:09:24] <huskarl_zap> it does not
[2:09:32] <%trackles_64> fire keeper soul?
[2:09:32] <%Deekman> this looks like isu shit from assassins creed lol
[2:09:43] <+TopTieramisu> i kinda love when games let you reach the endgame early on if you want to
[2:09:55] <%dds333a> big money
[2:09:59] <Zepptlus> what kind of game is this?
[2:10:04] <+TopTieramisu> souls-like
[2:10:09] <%dds333a> @toptieramisu it's why I love Chrono

[2:10:10] <crudjandall> @toptieramisu it also makes sense for a soulslike
[2:10:15] <+mechslayer71> yeah I think passing on this game was an acceptable decision
[2:10:17] <+Krasmeyts> In Sester We Trust
[2:10:18] <%trackles_64> trippy
[2:10:21] <tolloponik> PVP zone GO
[2:10:22] <huskarl_zap> balls deep now
[2:10:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:10:26] <+mechslayer71> these enemies are largely braindead
[2:10:29] <legacy0117> A shorter length souls-like apparently.
[2:10:31] <%livlinn> kayako?
[2:10:35] <Iwashi94> ngl I bounced off the game pretty hard even though I love Dark Souls... it just felt so sluggish and slow
[2:11:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Iwashi94 you'd beat it in 2 hours if it was fast and fluid lol
[2:11:18] <%hax_metatron> This is easily the best looking level, also it's the last level scaling wise
[2:11:31] <%hax_metatron> Like if if you can sequence break and get to Anor Londo early
[2:11:34] <BettyMwwaahh> can yall chill about how much you think the game falls apart or how much you hate it? Woolie and Reggie are trying to enjoy themselves
[2:11:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> How long is this game?
[2:11:37] <%cubbywolf> saved for last
[2:11:38] <crudjandall> @iwashi94 I have this reaction with pretty much every soulslike, but I'm glad that there is competition happening in the genre
[2:11:38] <snakemuho> Artem Demura is a godlike artist who worked on this
[2:11:38] <%Vigonept> dark souls 1 doesnt feel slow?
[2:11:52] <oda_flobunaga> @CanadianAnimatorGuy 10 hours ish
[2:12:05] <oneimportantthing> @bettymwwaahh pretty sure Woolie doesn't care what we think lol
[2:12:07] <%cubbywolf> no fast travel right?
[2:12:08] <%RyTYoung> Just fight the final boss in under 2 hours it'll be fiiiine
[2:12:11] <crudjandall> @vigonept not if you go watch the world record speedruns lol
[2:12:21] <slackerunchained> No teleport for you. You haven't earned the Lordvessel, yet. :P
[2:12:27] <%CafecitoGaming> @CanadianAnimatorGuy 6-10 depending on familiarity and how much you mess around or get lost because I came here second like Woolie did and didn't about face fast enough. Twas a costly mistake
[2:12:33] <%dds333a> @rytyoung hey, if the option is there
[2:12:35] <+TopTieramisu> @crudjandall i guess to a certain degree? but dark souls goes out of its way to gatekeep you from getting to the 2nd half of the game until you complete the thing
[2:12:51] <+theoldone001> I mean as much as I love Souls let's not pretend they're without jank. Let other devs try their hand at the genre, variety is great.
[2:13:21] <+TopTieramisu> botw lets you go to ganon right almost right away. and that's dope
[2:13:24] <%RyTYoung> @dds333a it'll be the shortest LP in the channels history LUL
[2:13:31] <legacy0117> Big poiseeee
[2:13:32] <crudjandall> @toptieramisu it literally offers you the master key as a gift and has no signs saying "go to burg first, maybe", the only indicator is damage
[2:13:41] <legacy0117> Bigger poiseee
[2:13:43] <huskarl_zap> peak the sideway khorne symbol top left
[2:13:47] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Do they say nectar like Dr. Bees?
[2:13:55] <%dds333a> @rytyoung hasn't  he had other one session lp's LUL
[2:14:02] <%dds333a> maybe not?
[2:14:18] <%CafecitoGaming> and a new weapon already
[2:14:21] <%trackles_64> Lets fight the boss
[2:14:22] <+TopTieramisu> @crudjandall the master key gives you access to areas that are still part of the first half of the game. the only exception is new londo and 4 kings
[2:14:25] <+PleasantLee> I think theres still a shell in the woods
[2:14:26] <%cubbywolf> its the order you do the levels
[2:14:30] <crudjandall> @theoldone001 people pretend souls games aren't jank? they probably started with DS3 NotLikeThis
[2:14:41] <slackerunchained> I once had a daydream where Woolie was pronouncing 'poise' like 'Pwahse'... Like 'Gaskwahn' all over again. :P
[2:14:44] <Owlboy7> @WoolieVersus you should explore the area where you find the king shell before the new area
[2:14:45] <%CafecitoGaming> yes it should be the last place you spoker to her on the mask
[2:15:04] <crudjandall> @toptieramisu those exceptions are exactly what I was mentioning
[2:15:07] <+TopTieramisu> @crudjandall and you certainly can't get to the kiln without getting all the lord souls, so the endgame is still locked away until anor londo
[2:15:21] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus there is a hidden shop
[2:15:27] <crudjandall> I never implied you can go literally anywhere in dark souls but it's far from Nioh lol
[2:15:33] <%dds333a> do all the preamble LUL
[2:15:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> beat the game rn, you won't
[2:15:56] <%HeroToxiko> "oh look some skeletons, surely those are weaklings" LUL
[2:15:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT THATS THE CHAD MOVE WOOLIE
[2:16:07] <%dds333a> @reallybigrocks LUL
[2:16:09] <+SmartAssPawn089> Neutral roll is a harden backstep
[2:16:13] <%Theycallmenerf> Woolie, push forward, you will not regret it.
[2:16:16] <puluxor> Do your jumping attack LUL
[2:16:20] <%patriotrenegade> do you know how hard it is to roll in full plate armor
[2:16:39] <%dds333a> if he really is able to just walk into the final boss, and he is able to back out, I want him to just try it for shits LUL
[2:16:47] <%patriotrenegade> it is so much easier to backstep and side-step
[2:16:51] <legacy0117> Ah no quickstep, makes sense.
[2:16:55] <Zepptlus> this game looks so unfinished ngl
[2:16:59] <%CafecitoGaming> Effigy's are shell switches yes. Like you might run into a boss and feel like you need more stamina or more tankiness and make the change
[2:17:00] <crudjandall> all I was saying is that it makes sense for a soul rip off to incorporate something like that, it doesn't not make sense LUL
[2:17:23] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:17:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:17:26] <MyNameIsRasus> ridin' dirty
[2:17:29] <+warlockwithapixie> This was made by a small team right?
[2:17:31] <%dds333a> classic ps2 skating LUL
[2:17:35] <%dds333a> I miss it
[2:17:36] <moonmintparadise> @warlockwithapixie Yes
[2:17:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @warlockwithapixie 4 people I believe
[2:17:47] <oda_flobunaga> Shop
[2:17:58] <+Tuffty> That zone wasn't endgame though, it's just one of the zones you need to go to, by design the last one.
[2:17:59] <%dds333a> who dat
[2:18:02] <+TopTieramisu> red skull sister
[2:18:02] <Zepptlus> 4 people???
[2:18:11] <Nabs96> is this an LP btw?
[2:18:32] <Nabs96> does anyone know?
[2:18:38] <Nabs96> or just a one off stream?
[2:18:48] <+セビー> unclear, but this is to fill ‘downtime’
[2:18:49] <Owlboy7> best upgrade to get early
[2:18:58] <crudjandall> people said you could walk to endgame in this game if you're good enough, I was just basing off if that, I'm not interested enough to actually play
[2:18:59] <Nabs96> so when ff6 LP?
[2:19:06] <%dds333a> ask again later Kappa
[2:19:12] <oneimportantthing> Should Woolie and Reggie/Pat play Elden Ring like they did the Bloodborne LP?
[2:19:13] <Zepptlus> @ReallyBigRocks i looked it up, it was 15 people
[2:19:15] <+セビー> @nabs96 waiting on a remake to drop
[2:19:25] <Nabs96> ah ok
[2:19:27] <MuFuzzy649> @nabs96 when it comes out
[2:19:38] <%insomniacCoder> @oneimportantthing yes
[2:19:43] <+セビー> it got delayed to like.. feb?
[2:19:45] <Cobaltor_252> she's fiiiiine
[2:19:45] <Invess> brest
[2:19:47] <Nabs96> @oneimportantthing I'd love that but I think woolie will play it w reggie, but woolz at the controller
[2:19:47] <%dds333a> yeah woolz is holding out until the pxl remaster of ffvi
[2:20:01] <MuFuzzy649> @oneimportantthing that would be cool
[2:20:04] <Nabs96> @mufuzzy649 ah I thought it was already out
[2:20:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> bruh, mascara getting in your eyes is the fuckin worst lol
[2:20:21] <+warlockwithapixie> You can disable the green filter on the game in the photo mode btw.
[2:20:28] <T_Sasquatch> i dont think we'll get woolie x pat lp anymore tbh
[2:20:34] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:20:50] <+warlockwithapixie> looks very different without it.
[2:20:51] <%dds333a> hard
[2:21:02] <%dds333a> LUL
[2:21:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:21:05] <puluxor> hggLul
[2:21:06] <crudjandall> @t_sasquatch why not? they did RE2 like a few years back?
[2:21:09] <Nabs96> @dds333a So I'm guessing next week is most likely also gonna be silent Hill and mortal shell, unless they somehow end up finishing one or both. Either way I'm always hyped for new LPs they're always so fun
[2:21:09] <+セビー> this is aggressively green tho
[2:21:11] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:21:15] <Arqartur0> Never Back Down, @WoolieVersus !
[2:21:15] <+ThePich> deng
[2:21:28] <%CafecitoGaming> @Nabs96 Holy crap Silent Shell?
[2:21:28] <yeildingthought> Lute! LUL
[2:21:31] <%dds333a> @nabs96 same, and both should be done soon
[2:21:38] <+セビー> better than mortal hill
[2:22:00] <%dds333a> these dudes poppin in to say hello LUL
[2:22:01] <Nabs96> @cafecitogaming LOL yeah playing this and silent Hill 1 this week
[2:22:11] <legacy0117> Definitely an interesting game this has been…But not nearly enough optional enemies and rewards, at least from what I’ve seen so far.
[2:22:11] <derap41> so this game is not super easy
[2:22:15] <%dds333a> they really do
[2:22:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SLAVE KNIGHT GAEL
[2:22:17] <+SmartAssPawn089> That happens a lot
[2:22:21] <T_Sasquatch> @crudjandall the corona combo plus reggie existing is making me doubt pat would go out of his way to go to woolies
[2:22:24] <%CafecitoGaming> @derap41 not at all
[2:22:31] <Nabs96> @dds333a I wad just wondering but wouldn't it be fun if woolz ever did an LP of dragons dogma or skyrim?
[2:22:39] <GoatArmageddon> Silent Hill will be done in two more streams it's not that long
[2:22:44] <oda_flobunaga> Fog of war? More like Fog of Vore
[2:22:48] <%CafecitoGaming> @WoolieVersus that shit wasn't happening on PC for me. That pop in might be a PS5 bug
[2:22:51] <%Vigonept> @nabs96 i dont think woolie would like either
[2:22:59] <Nabs96> @legacy0117 honestly I'd be fine w it if they gave us 60fps with that ps+ version
[2:23:00] <%dds333a> @nabs96 god. imagine skyrim with woolz LUL
[2:23:21] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:23:21] <Nabs96> @dds333a I'd honestly love it lol
[2:23:32] <oda_flobunaga> Woolie Versus Morrowind?
[2:23:33] <Nabs96> @vigonept Nah come on he can enjoy rpgs
[2:23:37] <+セビー> at least with skyrim the barrier is the world itself, not so much the systems
[2:23:39] <slackerunchained> This game feel 'weighty' but in a satisfying way... Like every character secretly weighs as much as a pickup truck. :P
[2:23:45] <DSD24> Stab you with this hammer
[2:23:46] <crudjandall> @t_sasquatch I'm completely ignorant about streaming, but would they not be able to just play online from they're own places? like they do the podcast?
[2:23:50] <%dds333a> not a lot, tbh, but yeah LUL
[2:24:00] <%Vigonept> @nabs96 maybe he'd enjoy the combat in dragons dogma but i dunno about skryim
[2:24:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> You also dropped your souls near the frogs, so might as well pick them up?
[2:24:16] <%CafecitoGaming> @slackerunchained yeah it's less jank and more heavy
[2:24:25] <+theoldone001> Skyrim without mods is boring to watch and play.
[2:24:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:24:29] <Nabs96> @crudjandall Yeah but I think for LP purposes maybe that wouldn't go too well but I'm not a YouTube so idk
[2:24:34] <T_Sasquatch> @crudjandall ohh you mean like a completely coop lp ? i thought you meant like a regular lp
[2:24:46] <+ClericOfSparda> I have never played Skyrim with mods
[2:24:58] <%dds333a> LUL woolieSTRIKE
[2:24:58] <slackerunchained> Find that bard and kil him for his lute!
[2:25:04] <HarshNerf> ppl really slandering base Skyrim rn daltooCringe
[2:25:13] <oneimportantthing> Is that Jaskier
[2:25:17] <Nabs96> @vigonept Honestly the combat in skyrim, while simple, is not bad at all. I don't think he'd have an issue with that tbh. he's enjoyed games with "worse"
[2:25:21] <+TopTieramisu> i wouldn't trust pat to stay focused on the LP playing remotely. plus the delay hurts the reaction to moments
[2:25:24] <crudjandall> @t_sasquatch or even if Pat is just on call for moral support? would it just be an issue because delay?
[2:25:27] <+セビー> enemies hate this one trick
[2:25:45] <crudjandall> @toptieramisu gotcha I understand now
[2:25:49] <%dds333a> Woolz fishing LUL
[2:25:59] <oneimportantthing> Nah we would need Pat in the same room to bully Woolie and do crazy talk
[2:25:59] <%Vigonept> @nabs96 well if he ever does I'd be all in lol. maybe even a fallout one of we get lucky
[2:26:00] <Nabs96> @harshnerf I do prefer w mods but I could easily play base skyrim. in fact just recently Todd forced me to buy the anniversary edition on ps5 and I'm having a blast
[2:26:01] <+theoldone001> Has Pat even finished a game that's not FFXiV lately? H drops games quick lol
[2:26:06] <%dds333a> He bodied Haden tho with it LUL
[2:26:07] <+TopTieramisu> i'm glad they at least did the dmc5 lp
[2:26:24] <%dds333a> I'M ADDICTED TO YOU
[2:26:26] <slackerunchained> Woolie killed the game's soundtrack! :O
[2:26:27] <+セビー> i think pat finishes stuff off stream more than on stream

[2:42:38] <DancesWitBalrog> hey guys, whats that in the air? is that ze script?
[2:42:41] <oda_flobunaga> @tanarath yes
[2:42:44] <%derpumpkinking> @woolieversus  Game is a little jank, but for the size of the team its extremely acceptable.

[2:45:49] <%dds333a> a Morshu for a new age LUL
[2:45:50] <%CafecitoGaming> you can consume tar for mor currency

[2:46:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Large bolts are for big nuts
[2:46:23] <%derpumpkinking> Ask again, does anyone know if they are running the DLC too, adds another fight and a weapon to main game.
[2:46:39] <zzNamttamzz> harden negates fall damage too
[2:46:44] <th3heromans> I like the familiarity mechanic in this game.
[2:46:46] <%CafecitoGaming> @derpumpkinking The PS5 version was the enhanced edition. should have come with the DLC
[2:46:48] <%dds333a> and run
[2:46:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> You got pocket tar too, you could use it to buy Quenching Acid or save up until you get 2500

[4:08:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, last I checked that boss was the last thing in the game, did they add more stuff?
[4:08:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i started with the winter place, using the lowest health armor and the martyr blade
[4:08:28] <+Grayhammatter> 15% more hp LUL
[4:08:28] <%dds333a> LUL
[4:08:33] <kes009900> why did he give up on the stamina shell?
[4:08:36] <%dds333a> Just more tank
[4:08:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> super hard
[4:08:45] <heartlesshealer> damage reduction buff?
[4:08:45] <%RyTYoung> coming out Jan 9th psaUp
[4:08:55] <+RobertWayneLewis98> woolie likes lots of hp i guess
[4:08:59] <sirrice77> @kes009900 he didn't like the low health, probably wasn't helped by the weapon he was using with it
[4:09:00] <%CafecitoGaming> It's a standalone onyx chunk of bs honestly it's big and needs you to branch off to unlock a bigger door in the middle like Demon Souls 1st zone
[4:09:09] <oda_flobunaga> Mores staggers is necessary
[4:09:40] <%dds333a> stack that shit to the ceiling
[4:09:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'm seeing another thing in here that is interesting: Glimpse doesn't come as easy as Tar, so if you want something that needs 20 Glimpse and 3k Tar, might as well buy shit with it or risk losing it all.
[4:10:02] <kes009900> @kes009900 i guess low health pool on a souls game isnt for the majority of players, after all
[4:10:22] <oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus that poise damage scales with Eredrim's damage stacks btw

[4:14:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> @sirrice77 that's kinda why I'm staying a bit clear, I already mentioned it once a month or two back.
[4:15:41] <sirrice77> @CappuccinoGuil oh then well probably should wait longer, maybe after a slot opens up in the schedule you can mention it again

[5:07:13] <%cubbywolf> get gud
[5:07:16] <The_Vainglory> That was rad.  Can't even be salty.
[5:07:18] <%RyTYoung> You just gotta be perfect then
[5:07:19] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, is the audio weird to you all? Like we're hearing the mics picking it up through the speakers?
[5:07:21] <%dds333a> established
[5:07:28] <KyJackshot> gotta collect some shrooms
[5:07:30] <%hax_metatron> @skagtheprinceofhell Yeah except the dodge left didn't seem to register for the poke attack
[5:07:35] <yukichocomilk> tar looking kinda sus
[5:07:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> @CappuccinoGuil Audio is fine on my end
[5:07:38] <+OrangeMDT> can we get a poll for woolie running into the ice aoe again?
[5:07:52] <skagtheprinceofhell> @hax_metatron Yeah, might have just barely clipped him.
[5:07:56] <%JustToWatch> You're taking a lot of damage from the lingering aoe
[5:07:57] <Djinnazz> it's not
[5:07:58] <%townzzzzz> DRINK UP
[5:07:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> @skagtheprinceofhell yeah, I don't know, some things sound fine, others don't.
[5:07:58] <%CafecitoGaming> Well watching it back you take too much damage diving in for that one hit IMO
[5:07:59] <%cubbywolf> he's not drinking souls for no raisin
[5:08:00] <%slimmixrp> You also take damage during the blinding
[5:08:03] <sirrice77> @WoolieVersus when you're running in after the AOE you're also taking damage
[5:08:07] <%RyTYoung> Yeah where the salty bets at?
[5:08:09] <huskarl_zap> Hey woolie say Tarsus backwards
[5:08:15] <%cubbywolf> owie
[5:08:17] <%dds333a> man, imagine if ingesting random shit took you to real life boss fights LUL
[5:08:17] <%pi_in_the_sci> You also take big damage when you run in on the AOE
[5:08:19] <huskarl_zap> 2020Shhh 2020Shhh 2020Shhh 2020Shhh 2020Shhh 2020Shhh
[5:08:21] <%hax_metatron> Tarsus Amogus
[5:08:29] <%cubbywolf> you where saying
[5:08:32] <%dds333a> he staggers real easy
[5:08:32] <+ArtemisCroc> he thinks the same thing about you
[5:08:35] <+tempestzephyr> In the Blender
[5:08:39] <slackerunchained> @huskarl_zap Woolie: "Tarsus Backwards..."
[5:08:41] <%townzzzzz> STINGER
[5:08:42] <+theoldone001> At least you start like right there, so multiple tries don't feel cheap.
[5:08:59] <+Jiggisnipe> will Woolie run into the ice this time?
[5:09:05] <%counterfeitgimmicks> yes
[5:09:07] <%dds333a> OUCH
[5:09:12] <+Grayhammatter> fucking oof
[5:09:13] <snoozeaholic> nah, Tarsus ran into him
[5:09:16] <%CafecitoGaming> @theoldone001 but you also start the fight with no counters so its much harder this way
[5:09:16] <%dds333a> face rolled
[5:09:28] <waltzqueen> "life is suffering"
[5:09:50] <%dds333a> still got the follow up
[5:09:53] <DSD24> Aww
[5:09:56] <%cubbywolf> oh if you go to him the sword goes to him cool

[5:10:27] <+theoldone001> I did this fight with Tiel and the Martyr's Blade, shit was hard lol
[5:10:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, is there music playing? Sounds muffled
[5:10:44] <+Grayhammatter> slapped the cheek there

[5:12:23] <%cubbywolf> ded
[5:12:27] <DSD24> Look on the style on this man
[5:12:27] <%cubbywolf> oh hp?
[5:12:31] <%dds333a> Harden
[5:12:33] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah, this is how you fight tarsus lol
[5:12:34] <%dds333a> POG
[5:12:35] <%cubbywolf> harden gave hp LUL
[5:12:35] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[5:12:35] <%slimmixrp> Oh real shit
[5:12:37] <leomuratore> Nice!!!
[5:12:44] <+TopTieramisu> that looks so jank
[5:13:07] <%dds333a> it's a hype interaction too
[5:13:15] <Djinnazz> DAMN
[5:13:16] <%dds333a> UPPER
[5:13:18] <+Jiggisnipe> damn
[5:13:20] <%slimmixrp> Wollie was going in
[5:13:21] <%cubbywolf> yep
[5:13:23] <+JasonTheJazz> theres no heal in this game?
[5:13:24] <BlackermanZX> this boi is real
[5:13:27] <%dds333a> two frame shoryu
[5:13:28] <+Jiggisnipe> i didn't know Woolie died once, damn
[5:13:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THAT AINT FALCO
[5:13:33] <tolloponik> wake up Dragon punch
[5:13:36] <huskarl_zap> Inflamed gland
[5:13:36] <+ArtemisCroc> @JasonTheJazz very minimal healing
[5:13:40] <sirrice77> @JasonTheJazz only from healing parries or limited consumables
[5:13:44] <leomuratore> @JasonTheJazz some items heal a little, but parrying heals more.
[5:13:53] <huskarl_zap> SUS RAT 😳
[5:13:53] <+JasonTheJazz> Thank you!
[5:13:56] <Deimos002> If I can do it you can do it :)
[5:13:57] <+twohitgood> @Jiggisnipe yeah, that first death was really fast then he got warmed up to the fight.
[5:14:00] <+Krasmeyts> Fight forever! 👏 👏 Fight Forever!
[5:14:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:14:05] <%cubbywolf> this boss wants to play hockey real bad
[5:14:10] <leomuratore> doodShake
[5:14:11] <%dds333a> FIGHT FOREVER
[5:14:11] <slackerunchained> So... Why does Tarsus care if you drank from some weird chalice, anyway? :\
[5:14:11] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Plz realize that running into the blinding ice saps 1/3rd of your hap bar
[5:14:27] <%cubbywolf> i think the challace lets you interact with him idk
[5:14:44] <%dds333a> Swinging
[5:14:53] <+Jiggisnipe> @twohitgood oh ok thx
[5:14:57] <+theoldone001> You can probably parry that slow down swing, like the big dudes in the forest.
[5:15:00] <%CafecitoGaming> I did this with Tiel I just needed the stamina for demolishing him when he goes down in second form
[5:15:04] <%cubbywolf> the stagger when invisible LUL
[5:15:37] <%dds333a> the jukes LUL
[5:15:55] <+Krasmeyts> Fight: Downloaded
[5:16:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, no, I'm certain now, stream audio is messed up, there's supposed to be music playing in this fight and we're barely hearing it.
[5:16:30] <slackerunchained> Wonder if Woolie can Harden right before tarsus swoops in on the ice?
[5:16:31] <RedCycloneInc> that goofy slide gives me life LUL
[5:16:31] <%cubbywolf> missed lol
[5:16:44] <+Grayhammatter> damn
[5:16:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> @CafecitoGaming if you have the effigies, couldn't you go in with one shell and then swap to Tiel for 2nd phase?
[5:16:52] <%cubbywolf> life is suffering
[5:16:57] <+twohitgood> great recovery on that
[5:16:58] <+JasonTheJazz> that was cool
[5:16:58] <%dds333a> I actually do hear other instruments a bit, but they're drowned out
[5:16:59] <+Krasmeyts> Nice punch
[5:16:59] <+ArtemisCroc> both of them are in phase 2
[5:17:00] <%CafecitoGaming> @CappuccinoGuil He was messing with that in the beginning of stream because it's copywrite music from a metal band I believe
[5:17:02] <leomuratore> That was bullshit
[5:17:02] <+TopTieramisu> basically even
[5:17:17] <slackerunchained> @leomuratore Bullshit blazing, even
[5:17:21] <%dds333a> COVER THE WORLS
[5:17:27] <%CafecitoGaming> @CappuccinoGuil I thought of that too but it's hard to assumupi
[5:17:27] <+Grayhammatter> what the fuck
[5:17:31] <+TopTieramisu> we seath, bois
[5:17:32] <%cubbywolf> UNLIMITED ICICLE WORKS
[5:17:47] <+ArtemisCroc> this is why I play with the higher stamina shells
[5:17:50] <%CafecitoGaming> @CappuccinoGuil assume u'll think about it because this boss is a little intimidating\
[5:18:04] <SparkAfterDark> This game seems like the only mechanic is waiting or waiting longer.
[5:18:10] <+Laycas49> Came back just in time to see him eat that upswing lol
[5:18:15] <%dds333a> SWANGIN
[5:18:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> That knockdown is just perfect for Tiel, I bet.
[5:18:25] <+theoldone001> Playing as Tiel for this fight forced me to git gud, one hit hurt bad
[5:18:30] <%dds333a> Damn LUL
[5:18:36] <%CafecitoGaming> @CappuccinoGuil def but I respect this
[5:18:36] <%dds333a> That harden
[5:18:40] <slackerunchained> He's got that pyramid Head Sword-drag goin' on, there...
[5:18:43] <+tempestzephyr> limbo
[5:18:52] <%dds333a> backdash on response LUL
[5:18:55] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[5:18:55] <%cubbywolf> he has the advantage because he's got skate boots LUL
[5:18:59] <+TopTieramisu> woolie's fighting JDCR or something?
[5:19:02] <XzileGaming> what period we in?
[5:19:07] <+TopTieramisu> these KBDs and sidesteps are insane
[5:19:08] <%cubbywolf> SO LUCKY
[5:19:16] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:19:18] <slackerunchained> That should have straight-up beheaded Woolie, there...
[5:19:37] <%cubbywolf> Lucky woolie
[5:19:40] <%dds333a> Nice
[5:19:40] <+Jiggisnipe> oh man
[5:19:45] <%cubbywolf> woolie got the footsies this time
[5:19:47] <leomuratore> Wow
[5:19:51] <DSD24> Slow walkin
[5:19:54] <%CafecitoGaming> a parry practically wins it
[5:19:55] <+crybirb> This game is alright
[5:20:00] <leomuratore> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[5:20:00] <%slimmixrp> jwongLETSGO jwongLETSGO jwongLETSGO
[5:20:02] <Bonebagmel> Never thought about souls like on ice, but here we are
[5:20:06] <yukichocomilk> this fight could really use some epic DS music
[5:20:07] <+JasonTheJazz> dont get greedy now
[5:20:08] <%cubbywolf> the boss's right side stay away from that...
[5:20:08] <+SmartAssPawn089> UH OH
[5:20:10] <%dds333a> RESET
[5:20:10] <%cubbywolf> .......

[5:20:17] <Djinnazz> XD
[5:20:17] <+Jiggisnipe> the game doesn't pause LUL
[5:20:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> Bullshit
[5:20:19] <DaKnightWarrior> lytKEK
[5:20:19] <%cubbywolf> THAT WAS FUNNY
[5:20:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah...yeah
[5:20:21] <RedCycloneInc> NotLikeThis
[5:20:22] <Bonebagmel> you... THOUGHT?
[5:20:23] <skagtheprinceofhell> I wanted to ask.
[5:20:23] <%counterfeitgimmicks> LMAO
[5:20:23] <+twohitgood> very souls-like
[5:20:24] <Enajy314> LUL
[5:20:24] <EarthGolem115_> Damn
[5:20:25] <zzNamttamzz> KEKW
[5:20:26] <+TopTieramisu> LMAOOOOOOO
[5:20:27] <%slimmixrp> Damb lol
[5:20:29] <karawra> Oof
[5:20:30] <sirrice77> inventory never stops time in souls games
[5:20:30] <+crybirb> It doesn't stop like souls games?
[5:20:36] <+SmartAssPawn089> If ya don't know... NOW YA KNOW
[5:20:37] <%cubbywolf> I thought it was frozen too cuz you were in the menus against a mob earleir
[5:20:37] <%megaman_sentinel> wtf
[5:20:37] <%slimmixrp> You were getting his ass though
[5:20:39] <slackerunchained> What part of your experience with past Suls games led you to believe that Pause was a Pause, Woolie?
[5:20:40] <%CappuccinoGuil> That is a DAMN FINE assumption, this looks totally paused now
[5:20:41] <+Krasmeyts> Za Wa-NAH
[5:20:43] <%CafecitoGaming> wait what?!
[5:20:44] <skagtheprinceofhell> Also I was surprised you could pull up the menu in a fight like it's Yakuza
[5:20:44] <DSD24> The First Martyr was like "Uh you ok there dude?"
[5:20:45] <leomuratore> Bullshit pause screen
[5:20:48] <+TheAmazingNick> "Sip or die" huh
[5:20:49] <+Jiggisnipe> that's alot for a game that doesn't pause LUL
[5:20:49] <+crybirb> Woolie is right, this is bad UX
[5:20:50] <%slimmixrp> Botched
[5:20:52] <breadmeng> only Sekiro pauses the game
[5:20:52] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:20:53] <HomebaseRED> the mind palace isnt safe
[5:20:54] <TheProtomanBlues> Yeah that's bad design
[5:20:57] <karawra> understandable honestly
[5:21:00] <%cubbywolf> HYPE HYPE HYPE hype... hype... aw
[5:21:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1475753733116076034?t=xDYBW5uS1mTPmSfuKiU8Qg&s=19
[5:21:01] <leomuratore> @crybirb on point.
[5:21:02] <%megaman_sentinel> you thought
[5:21:02] <+Grayhammatter> floored
[5:21:03] <SoaringTrumpet> LUL
[5:21:04] <+JasonTheJazz> Yeah, I dont put the blame on him for thinking that
[5:21:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, that's not good
[5:21:09] <Bonebagmel> He's going
[5:21:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie is totally right in that.
[5:21:12] <%cubbywolf> TAR SUS TAR SUS TAR SUS!
[5:21:18] <oda_flobunaga> 14 dev team
[5:21:19] <skagtheprinceofhell> Good to know at least
[5:21:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> I totally thought the same.
[5:21:24] <%cubbywolf> not good? its a souls mechanic
[5:21:30] <leomuratore> Half Lp half QA corner with Woolie and Reggie
[5:21:31] <+Jiggisnipe> yea game's ux can't block the world out and then not pause
[5:21:40] <bleugh> it's like that in souls because of multiplayer
[5:21:41] <Make_me_mad> I don't blame Woolie for thinking that but I also wouldn't call it bad design. It's a lesson that you learn once, hilariously, and then you know.
[5:21:44] <%cubbywolf> get in close
[5:21:50] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah, don't play on his terms
[5:21:54] <+ArtemisCroc> make him play on yours
[5:21:54] <+セビー> thing is souls has an overlay that still allows you to see movement on th sides
[5:21:58] <%dds333a> SLUGFEST
[5:22:09] <+TopTieramisu> that 1 2 always hits woolie after he hardens
[5:22:13] <+TheAmazingNick> it is bad design for sure
[5:22:18] <AsheStariel> thing is, this isnt Dark Souls is it?
[5:22:21] <%CafecitoGaming> yeah there is a HUD behind his camera for items
[5:22:24] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Def bad design lol
[5:22:26] <+Jiggisnipe> nice parry
[5:22:31] <sirrice77> i assume it's that way in this game because you can use items while in the inventory so if time stopped you could just chug a bunch of stuff no prob
[5:22:31] <%cubbywolf> Run no stamina
[5:22:37] <RedCycloneInc> @cubbywolf it's totally not exclusive to souls, it's just bad here because you're not in an "always online environment"
[5:22:39] <+TopTieramisu> oh, he must have been going for the parry all those times
[5:22:40] <%CafecitoGaming> Ah yes now we parrying he's got it
[5:22:41] <%dds333a> health bar almost annihilated
[5:22:46] <leomuratore> PogChamp
[5:23:02] <+Jiggisnipe> yea
[5:23:11] <+Jiggisnipe> picking up a shell is a free heal
[5:23:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Sick!
[5:23:17] <AngryAsian5> Wow
[5:23:18] <+TopTieramisu> free heal
[5:23:22] <+ArtemisCroc> now we're getting into the real tech
[5:23:24] <leomuratore> Free full heal. Damn!!!!!
[5:23:28] <%dds333a> yeah, you learned that earlier
[5:23:34] <The_Vainglory> How the turn tables.
[5:23:40] <+TheAmazingNick> Gwyn was also the first Martyr I guess
[5:23:52] <@Menitta> yo still goin
[5:23:57] <@Menitta> hell yeah
[5:24:02] <+Undenizen> Don't. Skating sucks.
[5:24:10] <slackerunchained> INB# Skaing becomes' Reggie's 'Kiting'
[5:24:11] <%AceNugget> Silver Surver Guts
[5:24:17] <+Krasmeyts> Did you ever do a cartwheel, Reggie?
[5:24:18] <breadmeng> Rundas battle, prime 3
[5:24:22] <TheProtomanBlues> @slackerunchained LUL
[5:24:24] <+Undenizen> people skate snow in your face and they're mean when you fall.
[5:24:26] <@Menitta> skating is fun as long as you don't do it bad and get blisters on your ankles
[5:24:36] <%dds333a> @breadmeng whole lotta ice

[5:26:33] <%doomunderthestairs> what is this white album?
[5:26:34] <%cubbywolf> I do agree, this boss's pattern makes the fight go on for a long time
[5:26:38] <%CafecitoGaming> I know he's mid fight but a switch to Tiel now might be clutch
[5:26:43] <breadmeng> mikiri counter him Kappa
[5:26:49] <RedCycloneInc> the bodies under the ice are eerie af
[5:26:56] <%cubbywolf> I think you can avoid the icicles and attack him but i might be wrong
[5:26:57] <%dds333a> wow
[5:27:12] <%Catpurnicus> fighting brian boitano here
[5:27:13] <snoozeaholic> if he had the ballista he coulda just pew pewd him
[5:27:17] <slackerunchained> @RedCycloneInc You do NOT recognize the bodies in the Ice...

[5:43:47] <+TheAmazingNick> @TheAmazingNick Nice. The first still holds up
[5:43:49] <%hax_metatron> Yeah it's a solid game where I feel the next game these devs make will be really good. Right now the game has some questionable decisions
[5:43:56] <%cubbywolf> this game keeps getting fun and then it platues and the indyness of the game shows, in my opinion
[5:44:08] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[5:44:10] <cartakus> Did woolie never learn the weapon combos,
[5:44:14] <cartakus> ?
[5:44:15] <carltonbankz> the game is decent but it's a one and done for me
[5:44:15] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[5:44:20] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:44:23] <%DensityD> I love the callout of "you whore"
[5:44:23] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[5:44:24] <%dds333a> @cartakus he tried a few
[5:44:29] <+Krasmeyts> You HGAR-y hanut
[5:44:55] <sirrice77> @carltonbankz but it has a roguelite mode now
[5:44:57] <%cubbywolf> this game reminds me of senua's sacrifice for some reason
[5:45:23] <cartakus> Solomon if I remember right is problably my favorite shell
[5:45:43] <+PkSilent01> Whose playing. Reggie or Woolie
[5:45:48] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie
[5:45:49] <%dds333a> Woolz
[5:45:51] <carltonbankz> @sirrice77 not really interested in it but it's cool that they added it
[5:45:54] <%DensityD> I'll try spinning, that's a good trick
[5:46:09] <%dds333a> LUL
[5:46:20] <+theoldone001> The game is great, just needs a lot more Shell and weapon variety. For the length of it it's fun but it does get stale with the small amount of variety.
[5:46:22] <cartakus> Also tbh I just ran in these parts
[5:46:40] <Ragnorok64> Is there an estus equivalent?
[5:46:47] <sirrice77> @Ragnorok64 Nope
[5:46:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ragnorok64 no
[5:47:03] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[5:47:05] <cartakus> You use drugs like mushrooms
[5:47:12] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:47:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ragnorok64 you use consumibles, which respawn in areas after some minutes, or you use a riposte to heal.
[5:47:14] <athuramn> ghostv3LUL
[5:47:23] <%dds333a> Just like DES with grass
[5:47:41] <Ragnorok64> I see.
[5:47:49] <sirrice77> Not quite, you could farm grass in DES much more easily
[5:48:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yo, a kick breaks his shield? Worth
[5:48:09] <%dds333a> @sirrice77 I only meant in the sense that it's a consumable
[5:48:14] <sirrice77> Oh i see
[5:48:27] <%CafecitoGaming> @sirrice77 you have to kill stuff for grass here the mushrooms just grow
[5:48:47] <%dds333a> he awaits
[5:48:52] <%CappuccinoGuil> wut?
[5:48:58] <%DensityD> just do the anor londo stairway skip
[5:49:00] <%dds333a> Now we both here LUL
[5:49:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> Get your Tar?
[5:49:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> handled
[5:49:26] <tolloponik> what tar he only had 100 on him

[5:49:29] <+Krasmeyts> Shell below?
[5:49:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> Also, the kill buff is stacking, and NOT going away?
[5:49:48] <%dds333a> quite the run
[5:49:49] <%CafecitoGaming> @WoolieVersus  you left your shell behind
[5:49:50] <cartakus> I wonder if woolie would like the surge 2
[5:49:50] <sirrice77> @CappuccinoGuil doesn't go away till knocked out of shell
[5:50:00] <Aussie_Manny> This game is so dark.
[5:50:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> @sirrice77 yo, that's good
[5:50:05] <%CafecitoGaming> it'll give you a heal and the tar back
[5:50:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Aussie_Manny this part is really dark.

[5:52:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> I don't think this is "walk back" this looks like a legit new zone
[5:52:05] <%dds333a> fear harden LUL

[5:57:21] <sirrice77> @TheProtomanBlues First dungeon boss for woolie, but you can do the dungeons in any order
[5:57:28] <oda_flobunaga> Every boss in the game can be fought first technically
[5:57:34] <%dds333a> yeah

[5:59:40] <karawra> cooool
[5:59:40] <@Menitta> it looked way cooler than I was led to believe
[5:59:43] <leomuratore> Clap
[5:59:50] <cartakus> You should look up how to change skins of shells
[5:59:52] <%dds333a> from OG Souls, to a soulslike
[5:59:54] <SainEdge> love for nice eurojank games PogChamp
[5:59:59] <buerdo> nice
[6:00:05] <%cubbywolf> for sure
[6:00:07] <+RyneKayLamb> up next Woolie will speed run it
[6:00:08] <+Jiggisnipe> yep
[6:00:12] <TheProtomanBlues> Oh is this eurojank?
[6:00:17] <%cubbywolf> id rather watch this game than play it LUL
[6:00:23] <+TroyThe2nd> have you played remnant from the ashes?
[6:00:24] <+Krasmeyts> ye ye, lets keep playing this and NEVER play Praey for the Gods
[6:00:30] <%WutangchickeN> woolie vs. eurojank.  NEW SERIES LUL
[6:00:31] <TheProtomanBlues> @cubbywolf def same
[6:00:49] <+Jiggisnipe> @Krasmeyts was that bad? I saw Pat played but it didn't seem for long
[6:01:13] <%cubbywolf> @WoolieVersus have you heard of Crying Suns?
[6:01:13] <@Menitta> Like online multiplayer
[6:01:20] <@Solidus_113> hey Praey is a fine game
[6:01:25] <@Solidus_113> Pat's just crazy
[6:01:36] <cartakus> I think this is a good start to souls likes. It is way better than lords of the fallen, the thing I'm playing now
[6:01:50] <oda_flobunaga> Its got some problems but it has good foundations.  It just does not develop on those foundations very much so there is very little reason to replay it or anything else.
[6:02:06] <oda_flobunaga> The final boss in particular has some ISSUES
[6:02:12] <+ArtemisCroc> mortal shell is a really good, short demon's souls-y game, love it a lot
[6:02:17] <%dds333a> you never stop yep
[6:02:36] <+crybirb> I like getting my donger hard anytime. It's a cool mechanic that should be improved and used more in other games.
[6:02:54] <zzNamttamzz> The DLC is pretty cool for a second playthrough
[6:03:05] <%dds333a> @crybirb erections on demand are quite powerful
[6:03:15] <+ArtemisCroc> yeah, that's spot on actually
[6:03:17] <cartakus> The axe katana is great
[6:03:21] <%counterfeitgimmicks> Did he discover you can go shell less?
[6:03:27] <+ArtemisCroc> Solomon is just a more technical basic guy
[6:03:31] <zzNamttamzz> Solomon gets 7 resolve
[6:03:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:03:32] <+crybirb> @dds333a Become HARD
[6:03:49] <cartakus> Solomon has the biggest amount of resolve
[6:03:50] <derap41> Mechanically interesting boring world really
[6:03:53] <%dds333a> Was it?
[6:03:54] <%DensityD> the zones are a ZONE
[6:04:03] <%dds333a> Sorry to that one dude I misled
[6:04:08] <fangovafang> or like Sinner
[6:04:10] <%cubbywolf> i think ive never seen the trailer and just saw gameplay
[6:04:17] <+crybirb> The zones are actually smaller than a single big dark souls zone.
[6:04:17] <+Krasmeyts> zoneDisgust Zone?
[6:04:18] <%dds333a> Like Titan Souls Kappa
[6:04:31] <%cubbywolf> there's a hub and they go to zones
[6:04:34] <@Menitta> I'm kinda glad it's not honestly. I prefer areas with stuff to buffer the bosses
[6:04:46] <@Menitta> plus it helps to learn the systems
[6:04:50] <%cubbywolf> once you see the full game it all unfolds in your mind brain
[6:04:52] <oda_flobunaga> @Crybirb yeah, except for the obsidian sky level
[6:05:10] <%DensityD> like bouncing off of a HARDEN
[6:05:10] <%dds333a> indeed
[6:05:20] <+crybirb> @oda_flobunaga yeah, I only tolerated the length of that zone because it was really pretty.
[6:05:28] <Red_XXII> pdaLove
[6:05:30] <%dds333a> yup
[6:05:34] <%CafecitoGaming> good stuff woolie take it easy
[6:05:52] <+max_radical> i beat this  about 2 weeks ago and i found the harden system made the game so easy once you get it down
[6:06:12] <%cubbywolf> I've heard mixed things about how good the ending is from manga readers but I love the show so much i dont care how it ends
[6:06:13] <sun312772> wtf why was i time out ?
[6:06:19] <%cubbywolf> i've heard its the best or the worst LUL
[6:06:21] <%livlinn> hoo boi
[6:06:29] <+crybirb> what anime?
[6:06:38] <%dds333a> AOT
[6:06:38] <%cubbywolf> attack on titan
[6:06:40] <+Jiggisnipe> Attack on Titan
[6:06:42] <+crybirb> oh
[6:06:53] <%dds333a> He popped up LUL
[6:07:04] <%cubbywolf> final season part 2 makes me LUL
[6:07:10] <derap41> Weak world building though
[6:07:11] <+crybirb> I literally CAN'T WAIT for Reggie play Bloodborne
[6:07:16] <oda_flobunaga> Attack on Titan? isn't that what the Avengers did in Infinity War?
[6:07:44] <derap41> Starting the game in a shitty swamp is a bold choice
[6:07:46] <+RyneKayLamb> I've only played the demo. after watching you play it @WoolieVersus , makes me want to pick it up
[6:07:50] <SainEdge> yeah the forest is really big and convoluted
[6:07:51] <cartakus> Th e forest is more like a hub to get red mushrooms
[6:07:55] <%dds333a> @oda_flobunaga not wrong Kappa
[6:07:56] <%cubbywolf> good thing you dont have to go back to the forest every time, OH WAIT YOU DO
[6:08:01] <cartakus> And skins
[6:08:05] <+ArtemisCroc> the hub blows, yeah
[6:08:08] <+ArtemisCroc> the other levels rock
[6:08:15] <+Mekhet09> It's better to get blighttown out of the way.
[6:08:19] <+Jiggisnipe> could you imagine LUL
