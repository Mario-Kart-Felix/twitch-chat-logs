[0:24:01] <fangovafang> I haven't seen this character before
[0:24:02] <nocromania> It’s a reversal while pressing a while blocking u can’t do a reversal don’t know if it cost meter thought

[0:24:57] <andre11dr> Holy shit, he even has the rock move that Gon does LUL
[0:24:59] <+Superbro64> basic combo structure is light > light xx down heavy xx jump cancel > air attack xx airdash cancel > air attack special @woolieversus
[0:25:00] <GutsSlime> is this the Best Mobile fighters
[0:25:06] <skyentombment> MID MATCH ADS FOR DMG INCREASE, let's just go all in!
[0:25:07] <+Superbro64> if the game still plays like the beta
[0:25:14] <+RickyDicklander> this isn't what i expected when i saw "playstation vita pets"
[0:25:16] <$Noponis> this is the best yes
[0:25:16] <+Jiggisnipe> is this X Tekken? Kappa
[0:25:21] <%JustToWatch> ok but does this have rollback netcode though
[0:25:25] <dds333a> According to what people have said, he actually was Gon, intentionally, it's only here that they made the distinction
[0:25:26] <+Superbro64> you can infinitely air dash cancel your air attacks as long as you have meter
[0:25:30] <%ggbhtg> high health, low time? MUST HAVE INFINITIES
[0:25:31] <skyentombment> AD CANCELS I'm seeing the future
[0:25:32] <krazedkarl> budget Yamazaki on a segway is killing me
[0:25:34] <GutsSlime> AD cancel súper
[0:25:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @nocromania thanks, i got like half of that i think LUL i have a lot to learn about fighting games still

[0:25:57] <andre11dr> Is that just Kakashi?
[0:26:04] <+Superbro64> what you can also do is heavy xx dash cancel > heavy xx dash cancel and so on until you run out of meter @woolieversus
[0:26:06] <Prevot> that's just fucking kakashi
[0:26:07] <$lumporr> is this a mobile game?

[0:44:06] <+Superbro64> give this game like 6-8 months more of dev time, this game could be MAD sick

[0:44:40] <+FuqBoiSlim> What the fuck
[0:44:42] <dds333a> @leomuratore yeah, that was Sensui
[0:44:43] <%ggbhtg> It's a historical landmark Kappa
[0:44:45] <blackkanye> what is this called?
[0:44:50] <lem______> just does monster dmg cause his dp and H dont have scaling for some reason
[0:44:51] <OkamiDude15> Vita fighter
[0:44:53] <+glgzephyr> the DISTORTION on that audio
[0:44:54] <+Superbro64> riki has infinite heavy kick dash cancels @woolieversus
[0:45:04] <+678saintglock> this is what ryu sees in the mirror
[0:45:08] <dds333a> Akira
[0:45:10] <+ManOfReason> fie long, ken, and karin
[0:45:13] <dds333a> Maybe?
[0:45:16] <+Jiggisnipe> yea Akira
[0:45:21] <leith_aziz> Im flabergasted you know so much about this game already chat
[0:45:21] <skyentombment> So, what could improve this game? Here's the fucking answer: BLITZ NETCODE
[0:45:26] <+Superbro64> oh yeah, this was kung fu man from mugen I think @woolieversus
[0:45:26] <%ggbhtg> Akira, known for his uppercuts Kappa
[0:45:28] <lem______> nah just 1 hit
[0:45:29] <+Superbro64> in the vita ver
[0:45:34] <%ggbhtg> and dash punches
[0:45:38] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> If time runs out on this stage, a giant hand appears and crushes both characters, and no one wins.
[0:45:43] <+glgzephyr> loop it in the corner LUL
[0:45:46] <$Noponis> none of you are ready for xyberknight
[0:45:50] <+FuqBoiSlim> woolie's chat lives and breathes the kusoge
[0:45:51] <andre11dr> He also kinda reminds me more of Jago
[0:45:54] <$Noponis> i hope they can even scratch the surface of xyberknight
[0:45:55] <DaKnightWarrior> But can he parry tho.
[0:46:05] <blackkanye> sick
[0:46:13] <lem______> everyone can parry
[0:46:14] <dds333a> It's literally just Ryu
[0:46:20] <+Chili_Daddy> FIVA
[0:46:23] <deafmelone> THAT IS KUNG FU MAN WTF
[0:46:38] <mrpoopandcaca> for yall ppl wondering if theres online, there is none atm but they're planning to with rollback
[0:46:46] <+Superbro64> yup, it was kfm in the original ver of this game
[0:46:54] <dds333a> But if he's saying "tiger" (I can't tell), then my mizoguchi comparison might still be there
[0:47:05] <leith_aziz> ?
[0:47:16] <+Superbro64> this ryu can dash cancel his shinku hadoukens too
[0:47:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> You telling me a phone game that used to be a vita homebrew game is getting rollback before tekken 7?
[0:47:23] <blackkanye> That sound makes me think of the Umineko counter whatever that mechanic was called stuff
[0:47:23] <vvaxyer> COUNTER BREAKER!
[0:47:36] <leith_aziz> Thats just a shadow counter
[0:48:08] <+glgzephyr> Woolie went for the j.K. 2k 2k LUL
[0:48:38] <silvergauge> yo is this an anime fighter
[0:48:48] <+toastybites> I am here for Playstation Vita Pets what is happening
[0:48:48] <dds333a> Woah
[0:49:01] <dds333a> Did he immediately back dash out of that
[0:49:19] <+glgzephyr> Saturday Afternoon Scrublords
[0:49:35] <andre11dr> Man is it just me or is the life a little high?
[0:49:54] <$Noponis> @WoolieVersus when you get to xyber, save for super. trust me
[0:49:55] <OkamiDude15> They just don’t know combos is the deal
[0:50:00] <dds333a> The tale of Riki still lives
[0:50:03] <JeoDood> megakid
[0:50:03] <Mirakei> is Reggie baptized? Because he just got CONFIRMED
[0:50:09] <+glgzephyr> we SAW Akira.
[0:50:10] <+b_aleph> gigaman
[0:50:10] <bevyrage> the damage in this game is also real low in general
[0:50:15] <JeoDood> zero
[0:50:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:19] <dds333a> Dammit, Reggie beat me to it
[0:50:19] <lem______> no dmg is super high
[0:50:20] <WeepyDevil> thats a green zero
[0:50:21] <+NarcissistCactus> fireball
[0:50:29] <bevyrage> the scaling is high
[0:50:32] <andre11dr> Oh that's definitely Zero
[0:50:36] <Afrosamasenpai> oh no the chun slide
[0:50:39] <leith_aziz> @FuqBoiSlim: I dont excuse the netcode of that game, and im a little frustrated at Bandai's communication in general, but with something like T7, there's obviously a lot of assets that has to be recoded properly for rollback compared to this mobile game that is pretty basic and uses very little assests. But again, that doesnt excuse Tekken's netcode.
[0:50:42] <skyentombment> that's a good name for your projectile!
[0:50:43] <lem______> new patch made a bunch of heavies have reduced scaling
[0:50:43] <WeepyDevil> his helmet is very MMZ Zero
[0:50:45] <+Superbro64> was this character kd/a? I cant remember
[0:50:50] <+NarcissistCactus> atpShh
[0:50:51] <%ggbhtg> FIYABAWL
[0:50:54] <+Superbro64> probably was cammy, though I doubt it
[0:50:54] <+egalitarian696969> is that just Pizza Sivir
[0:50:54] <%ggbhtg> RISING Dwagon!
[0:50:54] <Drunkengen> I think it is lol
[0:50:55] <fangovafang> J wong did some dope combos wit megakid
[0:50:56] <WeepyDevil> isn't that kd/a girl?
[0:50:59] <+marumariball> looks more Hayato than Zero
[0:51:00] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Megakid looks like the lovechild of Zero and Captain N’s Megaman.
[0:51:01] <lem______> so a lot a chars can bbreak 5-0% in corner no meter
[0:51:05] <Mirakei> It's definitely KDA Akali
[0:51:11] <leith_aziz> That is Zero
[0:51:13] <+egalitarian696969> yep that's what it is
[0:51:17] <leith_aziz> PREPARE FOR LOOPS
[0:51:26] <+Superbro64> the multihit stabs do ZERO damage and isnt cancellable, dont do it
[0:51:26] <+glgzephyr> oh my god that actually is KDA Akali
[0:51:28] <Mirakei> This game is shameless and i can't tell if i love it, hate it or respect it
[0:51:29] <andre11dr> I KNEW IT
[0:51:29] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[0:51:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> Let's see those lightning loops
[0:51:37] <skyentombment> Oh we have some cammy going
[0:51:37] <@Solidus_113> stuffed
[0:51:40] <%ggbhtg> S T U F F E D C R U S T
[0:51:41] <fangovafang> LuvOops
[0:51:45] <Klefth> ...What is this?
[0:51:49] <+Superbro64> multistab is slow, long recovery, no cancels. Classic scrub trap move
[0:51:55] <dds333a> Cammy with the DP
[0:52:00] <+FuqBoiSlim> @klefth game of the year
[0:52:01] <+glgzephyr> @Klefth This is a ripoff of Zero fighting KDA Akali
[0:52:10] <blackkanye> SourPls loop time
[0:52:10] <fangovafang> ?
[0:52:12] <%Sparkseid> YOOO
[0:52:14] <mr_sups> Cammy has a dp
[0:52:15] <Drunkengen> OYOYOYO
[0:52:17] <leith_aziz> SF3 PARRIES?
[0:52:20] <bevyrage> real weird how this apparent kd/a akali wears a pretty common kpop outfit and doesn't have any of akali's signature attacks
[0:52:26] <DaKnightWarrior> SO IT DOES HAVE A PARRY!
[0:52:28] <fangovafang> didn't know dat
[0:52:35] <+FuqBoiSlim> they KNEW?
[0:52:38] <dds333a> Actually, yeah, she does, I'm tired

[0:53:05] <%ggbhtg> CAPTAIN, SWORRRRRDO
[0:53:08] <leith_aziz> Vegito's sword
[0:53:13] <+Superbro64> this character looks like a mad cammy hybrid, so I dont know WHO she used to be
[0:53:15] <Mirakei> visually the characters look like popular video game characters, in terms of playstyle they play like a mix of various popular fighting game characters
[0:53:22] <%ggbhtg> CAPTAIN, SWORRRRRDO!!
[0:53:24] <+glgzephyr> I love how all three versions of that super got shouted out instantly LUL
[0:53:26] <Klefth> Captain Sword? LUL
[0:53:30] <+FuqBoiSlim> her health is gone
[0:53:30] <$Noponis> the comeback
[0:53:37] <+Superbro64> @mirakei game was originally a vita homebrewscene game
[0:53:42] <dds333a> Christ
[0:53:48] <+samuraiknack> Damn Reggie is looking more like a protagonist everyday
[0:53:58] <andre11dr> Im having trouble figuring out who she's supposed to
[0:54:04] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> ALL IS FALSEHOODS
[0:54:20] <Mirakei> @Superbro64 So i've heard. I was just explaining to those who were confused why they don't have moves of the characters they resemble
[0:54:27] <OkamiDude15> If this game had throws it’d be godlike
[0:54:30] <+Superbro64> @andre11dr truly the mystery to end all mysteries
[0:54:30] <deafmelone> Gouken,Cammy Hybrid?
[0:54:32] <WeepyDevil> @andre11dr characters don't all seem to just be one character
[0:54:40] <Agent_Sampson> Yo this is sick
[0:54:42] <WeepyDevil> like Gin is Gon, but he has a keyblade
[0:54:55] <%Sparkseid> Captain Sword X Excalibur
[0:55:02] <OkamiDude15> Megakid was tanjiro before hand
[0:55:03] <andre11dr> Wait there's no throws ?
[0:55:07] <%Wool> this stage music is uhhhh
[0:55:10] <dds333a> I've been focusing on the stage, because I feel like it's something
[0:55:19] <mrpoopandcaca> @andre11dr only wate and ben
[0:55:23] <+Superbro64> music is probably the only "meh" thing here
[0:55:29] <blackkanye> uh
[0:55:31] <+glgzephyr> yeah, Captain Sword is a single hit super, right?
[0:55:33] <%Sparkseid> DP dash cancel is nuts
[0:55:36] <dds333a> What a finish
[0:55:38] <+Superbro64> definitely will need to get someone to provide better tunes for the game
[0:55:39] <JeoDood> zero can slice fireballs
[0:55:39] <+Jiggisnipe> yea the music isn't great
[0:55:39] <blackkanye> lol thought the music was stuck
[0:55:49] <+Superbro64> the song music loops so poorly too
[0:56:00] <andre11dr> That music loop was melting my brain
[0:56:04] <OkamiDude15> I just turn the music off and put on other game music
[0:56:14] <+egalitarian696969> This is a KoF XI stage

[1:13:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm not crazy right that's the Overwatch font, right?
[1:13:23] <%ggbhtg> Meterless Dash Cancels during Install, that seems like something
[1:13:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CommanderSqueaks it looks like it
[1:13:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> @commandersqueaks oh thank god I thought I was alone
[1:13:33] <blackkanye> uninstall Kappa
[1:13:40] <%Jetzord> @CommanderSqueaks and now I cam't unsee it
[1:13:43] <+glgzephyr> that's totally the overwatch font, I played that game hours ago
[1:13:46] <%ggbhtg> touched
[1:13:53] <leith_aziz> punch
[1:13:54] <dds333a> That would've been sick if it landed
[1:13:57] <%ggbhtg> but yeah,
[1:13:58] <%ggbhtg> Meterless Dash Cancels during Install, that seems like something
[1:14:07] <OkamiDude15> That xyberknight trailer had some combos
[1:14:09] <+glgzephyr> it doesn't have the same drop shading, but it's close enough
[1:14:18] <dds333a> @glgzephyr yeah, and the Jump clouds seem like GG
[1:14:29] <ullyzeez> Millions is a sick name
[1:14:40] <+glgzephyr> they're stylistically identical, but technically different LUK

[1:15:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> Oh that's Tiger Road from KOF
[1:16:01] <andre11dr> Oh i know who he is ,his T Zock
[1:16:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> A lot of these character designs look like the RC Cola version of other known characters, but like not in a bad way? That sword girl from earlier reminds me of a Ciri cosplayer who didn't have time to change her wigs between costumes.
[1:16:17] <echobee_tv> Rock Howard the Bloodedge?
[1:16:26] <blackkanye> Rock Badguy Kappa

[1:17:46] <DaKnightWarrior> Nice
[1:17:53] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Ok, but aside from this, what games did Vita even have?
[1:17:55] <blackkanye> Is it just me that feels Kanji with how Wate moves around?
[1:18:08] <+Joe2187> What is thi?
[1:18:12] <blackkanye> Maybe the move that moves in the air
[1:18:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't fuck with a man wearing denim shorts and nothing else.
[1:18:15] <+Joe2187> this an actual vita game?
[1:18:19] <townzzzzz> needs a dust loop
[1:18:24] <dds333a> @blowfirethroattotem too many generic first person dungeon crawlers
[1:18:30] <+Jiggisnipe> it was a Vita Homebrew game at one point
[1:18:35] <acuwa64398> RATED RRRRRRRRRR
[1:18:36] <+glgzephyr> @Joe2187 Look below the screen
[1:18:37] <+Parrish_broadnax> Poppin Off
[1:18:38] <OkamiDude15> this was a vita home brew game that has now moved to the iOS/android store
[1:18:44] <%Jetzord> @CommanderSqueaks John Cena setting the bar
[1:18:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:49] <leith_aziz> I remember someone mentioning that a lot of previous SNK devs went on to work on Guilty Gear. That's probably where the similarities come from
[1:18:50] <OkamiDude15> Is still being updated
[1:18:51] <+Joe2187> I see
[1:19:07] <dds333a> Wizardry-likes, really
[1:19:21] <%CreggaMonsta> can someone post the game again?
[1:19:24] <Applecannon63> Was that a Gon?
[1:19:24] <mrpoopandcaca> i wish woolie or reggie play lawrence cause of his cutscene super
[1:19:29] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> Yo this game has Gon Freecss???
[1:19:42] <andre11dr> My one big complaint so far, the music is kinda wack
[1:19:48] <dds333a> We didn't see a lot of Shin Rae last time,
[1:19:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @andre11dr It's inoffensive, if nothing else.
[1:19:58] <leith_aziz> Rising.......
[1:20:10] <+Parrish_broadnax> Not nice enough
[1:20:16] <+BlowFireThroatTotem> The audio in general seems to be fairly wack, but I think that's part of it's charm
[1:20:24] <+Joe2187> I remember UMVC3 on vita being pretty much the quintesntial version of UMVC due to hitbox mode
[1:20:45] <fangovafang> u can definitely loop da stinger
[1:20:48] <+Parrish_broadnax> she'll never get to finish Rising bunnSad
[1:20:48] <leith_aziz> My issue with the music is that it repests the notes to quickly. makes it annoying fast
[1:20:59] <Applecannon63> Rising…! Whiff
[1:21:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is it weird that it'd love to see a slightly more polished version of this on console/pc?
[1:21:13] <+Joe2187> Skullgirls Vita also had rollback and PS3/PS4/Vita crossplay
[1:21:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Honestly, if they just spruced up the music and some of the audio design, I'd take this as is on the PC?
[1:21:24] <+Parrish_broadnax> She finally finshed rising
[1:21:26] <DaKnightWarrior> @cobalt_phoenix_ me too.
[1:21:38] <OkamiDude15> I imagine this will be put on steam when it’s actually finished
[1:21:47] <Applecannon63> tbh this reminds me of Streetfighter Ex
[1:22:06] <leith_aziz> This game is nice, but presentation wise, its really lacking for me, even if its free. But its still nice I guess
[1:22:07] <mrpoopandcaca> angrydevs will have a pc release atm
[1:22:38] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Is that Ciri?
[1:22:42] <townzzzzz> slow ass move
[1:22:43] <dds333a> So stuffed the sparks were still there

[1:48:12] <dds333a> Maybe a bit lacking? gotta get up in their face, seems like
[1:48:17] <+the22cstomp> wait is there a character use cooldown?
[1:48:25] <NiceChinChin> have they played Gin?
[1:48:29] <dds333a> yes
[1:48:34] <dds333a> first match
[1:48:36] <mrpoopandcaca> @BlackermanZX perhaps
[1:48:42] <Applecannon63> Woolie becoming what he endured
[1:48:51] <Equirah> @the22cstomp that's teh remaining time they're available until you have to watch another add to unlock them
[1:49:02] <dds333a> Woolie realizing his ANBU dreams
[1:49:21] <OkamiDude15> some characters need you to watch an ad before you can use them, the window is 30 minutes before you gotta watch another ad for them
[1:49:39] <Applecannon63> Ares is a shirtless Guile
[1:49:57] <dds333a> shirtless and tattooless
[1:50:17] <+Superbro64> *who* is fred segal?
[1:50:28] <mrpoopandcaca> @Superbro64 a sponsor
[1:50:38] <+Superbro64> like a brand of clothing?
[1:50:40] <OkamiDude15> fred segal is a clothing brand it seems
[1:50:41] <BlackermanZX> oh god he even does the hand signs LUL
[1:50:42] <RyuuAoi> String the bean, Reggie! do Combo!
[1:50:47] <+KennyKRool> Damn I love that they made Kakashi made good
[1:50:50] <+KennyKRool> Mad good*
[1:50:55] <dds333a> @blackermanzx oh yeah
[1:51:06] <RyuuAoi> I think Woolie found his groove!
[1:51:08] <OkamiDude15> "pop culture clothes since 1961"
[1:51:10] <dds333a> Akira is high tier so far, they had an actual serious match earlier
[1:51:23] <fangovafang> ares down punch can be a good starter
[1:51:27] <dds333a> looking that way, at least. I'm not certain
[1:52:07] <Applecannon63> the fuck is gin's deal?
[1:52:11] <RyuuAoi> Gud game. And it's free!
[1:52:22] <andre11dr> I say Akira and the vampire dude seem to be top tier so far
[1:52:23] <ullyzeez> wtf a keyblade?!
[1:52:28] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, this games got alot of freedom.
[1:52:31] <Applecannon63> oh god he is sora
[1:52:33] <BlackermanZX> not even trying to hide the fact its just a keyblade LUL
[1:52:34] <DaKnightWarrior> looks really fun.
[1:52:36] <OkamiDude15> you can follow up the headbutt with the power dunk
[1:52:39] <dds333a> According to what people more knowledgeable than I were saying earlier, he was originally Sora
[1:52:41] <%thedankestmeeme> so this isnt Sora?
[1:52:42] <jl_arts> Gin is Gon+Sora
[1:52:58] <andre11dr> Gora
[1:53:01] <dds333a> no pretense. they made him a "not-Gon" here

[1:54:17] <DaKnightWarrior> I like that the characters have different hit effects.
[1:54:29] <Mirakei> It's pronounced "Luffy"
[1:54:38] <dds333a> Kappa You just missed them

[1:55:24] <Ardisan_> This character didnt need a keyblade really. His cool moves arent even using it.
[1:55:40] <ullyzeez> @teras_ode the dogs didnt like the guys on camera idk y
[1:55:48] <jl_arts> Power Dunk and Wave combined lol
[1:55:51] <OkamiDude15> should have a bigger box, and be multi hit
[1:55:53] <Applecannon63> how wild if a Gin was more ABA
[1:55:57] <Mirakei> Dio + Dante = Dionte
[1:56:06] <Teras_ode> oh so they got pre-maturely euthanized by Sony or something? Kappa
[1:56:17] <BlackermanZX> its just an odm gear LUL
[1:56:20] <dds333a> @applecannon63 dude, an actual subsystem would be sick
[1:56:32] <dds333a> Gin all hopped up on blood
[1:56:37] <ullyzeez> bruh thats just dio with the lazer too
[1:56:42] <OkamiDude15> you can do forward special into back special follow up
[1:56:46] <BlackermanZX> shadow dio
[1:56:51] <DaKnightWarrior> JoJo vs AOT. place your bets.
[1:56:53] <%illicitdonut> Is this just legally distinct the game?
[1:56:59] <Mirakei> Yes
[1:57:00] <dds333a> @oh yeah, he's also got a bit of Jotaro's super
[1:57:08] <Applecannon63> Isn't there a Aot-like character in Blazblue?
[1:57:12] <OkamiDude15> yes
[1:57:14] <BlackermanZX> its literally Shadow Dio's moveset
[1:57:18] <EmYiKay> there is
[1:57:18] <blackkanye> Hibiki?
[1:57:34] <EmYiKay> yeah Hibiki it's his name
[1:57:37] <%emperordread> oh lord, I just alt tabbed back and it's Aaron Yager
[1:57:42] <Teras_ode> yeah that looks like the shadow? Dio from that sprite jojo fighting game
[1:58:03] <dds333a> He's aping DIO
[1:58:08] <Teras_ode> or pixel? idon't know
[1:58:20] <+RenoDeGeneric> Yeah he's probably closer to Shadow Dio but he just have the stand rush as well
[1:58:43] <dds333a> The SDIO stuff would include the counter and knives, whic i doubt he has
[1:58:49] <OkamiDude15> sprites are comprised of pixels so you're technically correct
[1:58:49] <Sulfur_Boride> Those are straight up all of DIO's L M H attack animations, too
[1:58:51] <EmYiKay> so Dio and Shadow Dio from Jojo HFTF combined then?
[1:59:29] <dds333a> He also only has the standard rush, from what we've seen so far in previous matches and this one
[1:59:39] <+RenoDeGeneric> It's just AN Dio lol
[1:59:43] <OkamiDude15> you can get his super off of the air knock down
[2:00:04] <Mirakei> Dio is the kinda guy who'd wipe out Tomato town
[2:00:13] <Teras_ode> he has a spirit summon that does rapid punches, that's super DIO inspired at the least
[2:00:20] <Sulfur_Boride> So despite Lawrence being an AOT character, are his attack animations at least original?
[2:00:56] <Mirakei> HUH!
[2:01:04] <mrpoopandcaca> pls do lawrence super
[2:01:04] <BlackermanZX> Lavi Wackerman
[2:01:05] <+RenoDeGeneric> His animations probably come from Hibiki from Blazblue
[2:01:09] <dds333a> @teras_ode oh, he's just LITERALLY DIO, down to the animations, but he doesn't have everything, and that super us more akin to Jotaro in jojoban
[2:01:10] <%blacksoap65> Jojo wins !
[2:01:10] <OkamiDude15> better to just air dash and punish
[2:01:22] <fangovafang> needs some work
[2:01:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:01:36] <Teras_ode> @dds333a ah gotcha
[2:01:49] <%emperordread> A little Ryu, as a treat
[2:02:02] <Teras_ode> Ryu vs ???
[2:02:02] <Mirakei> Gotta earn your Ryu
[2:02:11] <Mirakei> Eat your vegetables first then you can have your Ryu
[2:02:16] <ullyzeez> yo that game is great reggie
[2:02:19] <EmYiKay> Sagat, maybe?
[2:02:21] <dds333a> I think OFF parodied it
[2:02:31] <dds333a> At the very end
[2:03:00] <Teras_ode> knee makes me think of Captain Falcon but I don't think the rest of it is him
[2:03:36] <dds333a> Xyberknight is also pretty original from what we saw earlier, minis his Falcon/Tiger Knee/Tiger Kick
[2:03:43] <Applecannon63> Xyberknight is captain falcon with I wanna say Slayer but looks underwhelming
[2:03:59] <fangovafang> he's better when u hit dat install
[2:04:00] <+RenoDeGeneric> That's a Devil Jin move
[2:04:04] <dds333a> He also has that blade install that apparently has meterless dash cancels?
[2:04:06] <lem______> cyberknight is wack till install, then is good for like 15 seconds
[2:04:19] <BlackermanZX> xybernight is just an old man with a tron costume doodBait
[2:04:21] <Sulfur_Boride> Did he literally just say Shinku hadoken? Just all distorted?
[2:04:31] <dds333a> there it is
[2:04:32] <Teras_ode> his idle stance looks just a little bit like captain falcon's I'd say
[2:04:35] <$Noponis> the free dash cancels are insane
[2:04:50] <dds333a> @teras_ode I see it
[2:04:51] <Teras_ode> elbows are just a little bit higher
[2:05:11] <OkamiDude15> infinite dash cancels lead to big big damage
[2:05:14] <Applecannon63> so like the impracticality of di?
[2:05:15] <andre11dr> He kinda reminds me of Zappa in a way, like how Zappa builds up to Raoh
[2:05:24] <dds333a> Timed OUT
[2:05:34] <lem______> but zappa is good v=before raoh tho
[2:05:47] <BlackermanZX> megakid is just green biker dude from megaman X2 doodHokey
[2:05:50] <OkamiDude15> rollback is being worked on as we speak
[2:05:54] <dds333a> This match again

[2:08:37] <dds333a> Yo, that Vanessa Diving Puncher
