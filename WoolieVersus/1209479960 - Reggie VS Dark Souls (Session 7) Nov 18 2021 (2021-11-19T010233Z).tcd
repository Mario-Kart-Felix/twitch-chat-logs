[0:00:45] <%CateHecate> Every Dark has it's Soul
[0:00:45] <$ArCielArDor> @leith_aziz probably a regional thing. I get nothing but them on YouTube these days.

[0:04:03] <leith_aziz> Are you describing LoL players?
[0:04:03] <%CateHecate> @brandt_connors rang both bells, beat catacombs just now, went a little bit into Tomb, now climbing up the catacombs up to Sen's
[0:04:10] <thefreakmuseum> reggie is telling the story 100% accurately.
[0:04:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Woolie is EXUDING Boomer energy now

[0:04:56] <seydaq> @cappuccinoguil thats why we love our dreaded boomer
[0:04:57] <leith_aziz> I've never owned a Nintendo console
[0:04:58] <T_Sasquatch> Hello fellow kids, ya like fightin gamez
[0:04:58] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus all my kids were crazy into the VS mode on Spelunky they're god tier at it
[0:05:00] <+VongolaGearX> speaking of smash :" first officially licensed Super Smash Bros. championship circuit in North America in 2022"
[0:05:03] <+RyTYoung> BUT SUPER SHAGGY
[0:05:06] <HarshNerf> f2p dominates the culture
[0:05:07] <%Dakuu75> that's much more depressing
[0:05:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ShinobiPhoenix subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Amazon Prime LOVES to not continue my Streak, here's your Bazo Bucks.
[0:05:25] <+robertoszek> get down your ivory tower, Woolie LUL
[0:05:27] <seydaq> adventure time and steven universe. catnip for kids
[0:05:27] <Crowroost> This is how you beat Nintendo; by having Nintendo be Nintendo LUL
[0:05:31] <SaiyanShoto> My cousin actually hates Smash and prefers Brawlhala
[0:05:32] <OblivionSword1> Have you even try Brawlhalla @WoolieVersus ?
[0:05:38] <%CateHecate> considering the whole f2p thing, whenever the League of Legends fighter comes out its going to probably be huge
[0:05:42] <wibbwobbler> Yuuup that’s amazing
[0:05:45] <%Solidnick18> Brawlhalla art style makes me sick. i can't look at it.
[0:05:46] <%MonsieurHonHon> Its a fun game for sure
[0:05:57] <@Solidus_113> rivals of aether deserves the attention
[0:05:59] <KombatJunkeeTV> i tried it on my ps and i had fun cus i could use mt arcade stick but i havent played it in a min
[0:06:01] <Treasure_Vault> Vindictus is free* and it has cool bits around the other bits.
[0:06:07] <leith_aziz> @CateHecate Im curious as wether that's going to be a good or bad thing. Though we've allready had to deal with NRS players
[0:06:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:06:11] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:06:14] <%Necnill> LUL woolieONEGUY
[0:06:14] <OblivionSword1> alright I was just wondering
[0:06:16] <%MonsieurHonHon> Its got cool techs and stuff but the combos are repetitive
[0:06:18] <youngking_kush> LUL
[0:06:18] <$horse_oil> do combo
[0:06:21] <+kewlmyc> @mechslayer71 One of the qualifiers. I forget which one.
[0:06:22] <leith_aziz> Let him be guys
[0:06:22] <%CappuccinoGuil> We love busting Woolie for throwing shade, it's fun.
[0:06:22] <T_Sasquatch> Yea but did you TRY?
[0:06:23] <derap41> Chaos Faction best Smash Cline
[0:06:24] <thefreakmuseum> the game is pretty fun tbh, but the kids were 2 good for us.
[0:06:38] <%CateHecate> @leith_aziz it will be a good thing in the sense that I will be more likely to get in day 1 on a fighter and may potentially not be shit at one LUL
[0:06:39] <seydaq> yeah @solidnick18 . got that babys first dragon bones project vibes
[0:06:46] <leith_aziz> Tekken Revolution tried that once. It didnt go well
[0:06:51] <leith_aziz> But I never played it myself
[0:06:52] <Xaeveax> When I tried it felt really sluggish and unresponsive compared to Smash.
[0:06:52] <@Solidus_113> Project L any day now...
[0:06:53] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Also needs decent netcode
[0:07:01] <HarshNerf> @leith_aziz that was unplayable online tho,bad servers
[0:07:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> IT'S FREE.99
[0:07:04] <%Seancicle> skooku2Hype
[0:07:05] <Crowroost> If the LoL fighter isn't FTP they're shooting themselves in the foot
[0:07:07] <%MonsieurHonHon> also keep in mind the characters are easier to design because you only need a skin + half the move set
[0:07:16] <%Vextalyst> Vextalyst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Yo Woolie I will never understand people who want to rewind. I don't want to think about a timeline without Reggie or the occasional Minh, V and Punchwife. This Dark Souls LP has been a genuine treat and it's great to see you getting better and better.
[0:07:21] <%CaptainBeird> CaptainBeird subscribed with Prime. 
[0:07:21] <DXLelouch24> UI Shaggy is canon in a fighter
[0:07:24] <SaiyanShoto> Again, fighting games need to start copying from each other
[0:07:26] <+kewlmyc> To be fair, Smash isn't on PC and Brawlhalla has not shit online
[0:07:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am EXTREMELY excited for Multiversus
[0:07:32] <%FFXIVsFreeTrial> bro that halo infinite f2p multiplayer tho
[0:07:33] <+robertoszek> let people enjoy things, popular does not necessarily equal to objectively bad
[0:07:35] <Crowroost> Woolie, you're just saving them from a future of no showers
[0:07:38] <T_Sasquatch> Fighting games have to remove motion inputs and make it free to play before they'll ever get mainstream.  Rising thunder almost did it
[0:07:38] <leith_aziz> @SaiyanShoto You're not the first to say that FYI
[0:07:42] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:07:49] <HarshNerf> the day Nintendo discovers f2p in 20 years it's OVER
[0:07:54] <SaiyanShoto> @leith_aziz I know, that’s why I said again
[0:07:57] <%CateHecate> bringing massive thuggery to the children's tourney
[0:07:59] <leith_aziz> @T_Sasquatch Motion inputs, no. They have reasons for being the way they are
[0:08:02] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:08:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> I don't know, I'll take Brawhalla, NASB and Multiversus over Nintendo's hatred for the competitive scene
[0:08:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this may not be the perfect timeline (for a myriad of reasons) but it's OUR timeline and goddamn it I love it, im with you on that
[0:08:10] <%Dakuu75> took a look into the fog wall and NOPED the fuck out
[0:08:12] <+mechslayer71> AYYEEERRR

[0:08:40] <T_Sasquatch> @leith_aziz im not saying they should go but as long as they exist they'll never be truly mainstream

[0:09:49] <leith_aziz> I am so confused on how to feel
[0:09:50] <+kewlmyc> Better be in person. If it's online, it's going to be a shitshow
[0:09:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> @TheBesteban I don't fucking believe you, this is an illusion, a trick, an enemy stand.
[0:09:58] <%scrumbotime> It's  TRAP
[0:09:59] <leith_aziz> pickyOof ?
[0:10:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> WHAT'S THE CATCH???
[0:10:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @CappuccinoGuil If you go on the website and read the Character Pages, the original character Raindog directly calls out THE NOTHING and The Neverending Story is WB distributed
[0:10:08] <%TheBesteban> I wield Requiem
[0:10:11] <+Stormiercashew> maybe with no more dlc hype they gotta keep the interest somehow
[0:10:11] <Treasure_Vault> the fax came through from Nintendo Japan
[0:10:17] <+kewlmyc> Smash Escene has money in it, who would have thought
[0:10:19] <Crowroost> The money you lose on controllers, you win BACK by saving on the water bill Kappa
[0:10:23] <%Solidnick18> This seems very shady
[0:10:34] <%scrumbotime> The prize is given in NFTs
[0:10:36] <%MonsieurHonHon> nintendo being weird and wacky? who wouda thunk
[0:10:40] <%shakespearo> has there never been an official melee tournament? I didn't know that
[0:10:43] <warpiscute> captain falcon is sick
[0:10:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ShinobiPhoenix I will fucking LOSE IT if they use The Nothing as a threat for a potential story mode like Subspace Emissary
[0:10:47] <%MonsieurHonHon> also fuck nintendo killed the best smash game PM for life
[0:10:58] <+robertoszek> end of life for ultimate, no more DLCs so they don't see the previous Smash games as competition anymore
[0:11:06] <%MonsieurHonHon> I started my locals back in college

[0:11:34] <warpiscute> give us melee HD
[0:11:39] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe cuz the Ultimate's dlc is done
[0:11:42] <Xaeveax> I doubt it.
[0:11:46] <+kewlmyc> It's NINTENDO, Woolie. A full release including all DLC isn't happening unless it's a port to a new console later on.

[0:12:18] <+kewlmyc> Hell, Nintendo games don't even go down in price3
[0:12:24] <%Juriasu> did sakurai block it all this time?

[0:12:40] <+RyTYoung> @catehecate BibleThump
[0:12:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ShinobiPhoenix Yeah, but is there any mention of a story mode or something? With actual levels and stuff, not just "here's a cutscene now fight this character"
[0:12:50] <Crowroost> IVE GOT IT, Nintendo must've gotten a majority share on CRTs
[0:13:01] <Mahuloq> It was always silly to not recognize the historic one, its not like most people would go out and get it.
[0:13:11] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, virtual console is the best you're going to get with a Melee rerelease
[0:13:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:13:42] <%Solidnick18> idk how you would even get one
[0:13:51] <leith_aziz> @CappuccinoGuil Same. You cant expect the playerbase to stick online all the time. Give me actual levels with replayabillity value. Not just cutscenes then fight an AI

[0:19:34] <Crowroost> "Dear John Deere; fuck you, pay me."

[0:19:57] <youngking_kush> @woolieversus There's a weird opaque thing over your forehead
[0:19:58] <+askalta> but that's bad because when I'm boss I don't wanna pay people that

[0:26:27] <+kewlmyc> It's a game that really works with replays
[0:26:29] <DapperCadavr> @woolieversus a designer for the game released secret lore posters for the Pale and a new thing called "magpies"

[0:26:53] <leith_aziz> Funny thing is, I think this game is too complex for me to enjoy. I'm just a highschooler
[0:26:55] <+kewlmyc> spoilers done btw
[0:27:09] <%Ensign_Epic> The necktie also warns you of Ruud trying to shoot you. the neckties final act as it is burning to death is warning its owner of his own mortal peril. Necktie is some baller shit.
[0:27:09] <Wyldesquirrel> I feel like i just walked in on a JoJo spoiler conversation
[0:27:16] <%Deekman> thanks i had to bail for spoilers lol
[0:27:17] <+mechslayer71> machine operators wouldn't be considered unskilled anyway tho, right
[0:27:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Ensign_Epic I'm gonna name my firstborn "Necktie"
[0:27:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:35:21] <%Lion_kun> Did Reg get the item from the fuck room?
[0:35:27] <Crowroost> Anything less than ending the game wearing the Boar would be blasphemy at this point
[0:35:28] <VincentGraves> yo Reggie needs to learn how to kite with a bow
[0:35:28] <%MonsieurHonHon> them wheel boys
[0:35:41] <owensleftfoot> Oh it's the fuckiest

[0:36:04] <bruuzer12> Bonewheels are masters of the fuckx
[0:36:10] <pennykettle_> I love how they don't stop rolling when they hit the shield
[0:36:11] <%Ensign_Epic> you only should sprint through it if you have a good idea of how their AI works and how they will route down that hall

[0:36:32] <+robertoszek> ! ADVICE AT RISK !
[0:36:39] <youngking_kush> The trick is to let him pass to then run after him so you kill him before he turns around
[0:36:40] <HarshNerf> woolie casts confusion
[0:36:42] <oda_flobunaga> Da na na na naaaaaaaa
[0:36:47] <Crowroost> You've Boost Power! Use it!
[0:36:50] <+0dinpen> do they not drive into the wall out of world anymore
[0:36:52] <%Ensign_Epic> all he needs to do is grab the vamos bonfire and that's the stream getting off the ground
[0:36:53] <owensleftfoot> Slow and steady wins this race
[0:36:54] <BigYanno> do it slowly and you only have to do it once
[0:37:04] <theredfox930000> that thing that thinning
[0:37:08] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[0:37:10] <Jaysky> Imagine not having a bonfire nearby, eh? Man that would suck.
[0:37:10] <+Jiggisnipe> methodical... yes that's dark souls
[0:37:10] <%Lion_kun> There are a few fuck rooms in the game. Like the ToG room and Wheel Skeletons valley.
[0:37:11] <%scrumbotime> Funnily enough, I'm currently finally watching Reggie's Demon's Souls, and I'm at the point with the skeletons.
[0:37:13] <%hax_metatron> This is Dark Souls bro. Of course we methodical LUL
[0:37:19] <atlasdotwav> Good adjustment
[0:37:23] <Crowroost> "fuckouttaheyre"
[0:37:24] <rasamune> boi-oi-oi-oi-oing
[0:37:33] <BigYanno> do not kick the wheel
[0:37:34] <Crowroost> KICK the wheel
[0:37:42] <%Lion_kun> Bloodborne is the one that is about aggression not DS lol
[0:37:45] <BigYanno> DO NOT kick the wheel
[0:37:52] <%vVAstrAVv> doing good
[0:37:53] <%MonsieurHonHon> can you parry wheel skellys?
[0:37:58] <BigYanno> no
[0:37:59] <owensleftfoot> SIT
[0:38:00] <+セビー> aggression =/= confidence
[0:38:01] <+kewlmyc> Wheel Skeletons is such a troll ass design. I love it.
[0:38:04] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Well done!
[0:38:07] <owensleftfoot> ok, worst part is over
[0:38:08] <+Jiggisnipe> gj
[0:38:09] <seydaq> 1st try
[0:38:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YOU DID IT!
[0:38:10] <wqorst> reggie drinks mad quick compared to the start where he'd jaunt around at 30% regularly
[0:38:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> escape gaiden concluded
[0:38:11] <kjb343> WE OUT
[0:38:11] <pennykettle_> I don't know enough about physics to say that you wouldn't be able to a bonewheel thing IRL
[0:38:12] <OblivionSword1> eyyy
[0:38:15] <+extradopeness> MADE IT
[0:38:19] <%Ensign_Epic> and safe
[0:38:20] <+Bitscreed> Yay!
[0:38:25] <owensleftfoot> Smooth sailing from here
[0:38:26] <Crowroost> "now climb up."
[0:38:28] <MeImoth> Doing this kind of run slowly once is faster then trying to rush it and fucking it up 5 times
[0:38:32] <+extradopeness> congrats Reggie!
[0:38:38] <Hellvis92> to think this bonfire did not exist back in the day
[0:38:39] <%burquina> woolieYE
[0:38:41] <Wyldesquirrel> Its good that we traumatized Reggie to the wheelies early, sets up a nice pop off in the painting
[0:38:41] <%MonsieurHonHon> is it half assed if he reached it
[0:38:44] <HarshNerf> @pennykettle_ have you ever played with a car tire? that shit will knock you over
[0:38:50] <%CaptainBeird> he's free!
[0:38:54] <pennykettle_> no I haven't
[0:38:55] <bobxmaker> reggie is gonna be soooo happy when everything else is gonna seem so easy compared to the hell hole that is tomb of giants
[0:39:03] <%MonsieurHonHon> ^
[0:39:19] <%Seancicle> 👌🏻 körper est gut.
[0:39:22] <BigYanno> yeah they've respawned, but he's not in a Black Hole of Pain anymore

[0:39:32] <Crowroost> "you THOUGHT."
[0:39:35] <%Ensign_Epic> Reggie with the good strats. not worth fighting an enemy you don't need to but at the same time, worth fighting some enemies to make things more reliable
[0:39:38] <%MonsieurHonHon> WELCOME TO THE BONE ZONE

[0:39:55] <+Jiggisnipe> shred your stamina and health, welcome to the bone zone
[0:39:55] <Treasure_Vault> I hope Elden Ring has a bonewheel summon.
[0:39:58] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus is he using the poise ring to stand up to those skeletons?
[0:40:00] <%MonsieurHonHon> @theredfox930000 can you elaborate on that
[0:40:08] <Wyldesquirrel> The Wheelies saw reggie shielding  and thought 'How Cute eh?'
[0:40:11] <@Solidus_113> damned boar helm LUL
[0:40:25] <youngking_kush> The boar helmet is pretty heavy NGL
[0:40:28] <royb2> higher shield stability would reduce the stamina damage
[0:40:31] <Crowroost> @theredfox930000 "My motto, fuck Londo"
[0:40:32] <youngking_kush> But he likes it tho
[0:40:38] <+0dinpen> Vamos help!
[0:40:38] <atlasdotwav> Shield Stability would help
[0:40:44] <pennykettle_> This is a pretty ballsy bonfire to add, getting stuck so hard down here
[0:40:44] <theredfox930000> he's given no fucks and going kill it
[0:40:55] <%Seancicle> minen zuerst wort war schiße
[0:40:58] <+KennyKRool> Fuck yeah it's dark souls!
[0:40:59] <owensleftfoot> @youngking_kush Oh reggie is NEVER taking that shit off bro
[0:41:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> yeah crest shield is great for magic, but lower stab
[0:41:14] <SheefEatsBeef> yup
[0:41:15] <BigYanno> but never have they been as much as a problem as in one specific place in DS1
[0:41:22] <adimcorner> shout out to Saint Catherine
[0:41:23] <%guiltyboya> Tower of Judgment arc
[0:41:28] <%TheOddJik> oh fuck i forgot the wheely bois were in Berserk
[0:41:29] <+RyTYoung> I did not know Beserk had skellywheels!
[0:41:30] <youngking_kush> Ripped right from the page damn near

[0:41:30] <%Seancicle> göt in himmel

[0:42:01] <atlasdotwav> Is Bastard sword a berserk reference
[0:42:04] <+kewlmyc> WutFace
[0:42:10] <+KennyKRool> Imagine taking off the boar helmet LUK
[0:42:12] <@Solidus_113> it's a torture attack in bayonetta
[0:42:13] <Crowroost> Torturing folks, blasting "Highland Forces"
[0:42:14] <FrostedZaibatsu> That was real
[0:42:17] <%mr_sups> @Woolie listen to PainforTainment from Dan Carlin?
[0:42:18] <BlueEagle2395> @ozzrabbit i think he's really commited to the way of the Boar
[0:42:23] <+Jiggisnipe> @ozzrabbit he's a Pig Boi so he won't, fashion souls baybee
[0:42:26] <%guiltyboya> Berserk is a Dark Souls reference
[0:42:28] <+KennyKRool> Oh yeah the wheel is in Bayo
[0:42:43] <seydaq> @ozzrabbit the pig hat never goes off plagueLUL
[0:42:47] <HarshNerf> when you got too many carts and too many criminals putting them together just makes sense
[0:43:06] <GoogleyGareth> Someone looked at the wheel and said "we can do better".
[0:43:07] <derap41> Ince the legs and arms are broken hang en up to fry in the sun
[0:43:07] <+eanscrale> Now imagine if the romans came up with taht, every graveyard would be filled with wheels
[0:43:08] <@Solidus_113> still are
[0:43:12] <+0dinpen> hippos
[0:43:21] <waltzqueen> Dolphoins
[0:43:23] <FrostedZaibatsu> They killed people for Jesus then turned around and did shit like this
[0:43:29] <owensleftfoot> I thought it was that they tie you to the ground and smash your arms and legs WITH the wheel
[0:43:32] <Crowroost> "We can improve this."
[0:43:32] <brunoberserk> nah , dolphins are worst
[0:43:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> reinforces that revenge urge
[0:43:37] <oda_flobunaga> So, is like 1/3 of Elden ring just going to happen on a boat?
[0:43:38] <%sewermonk> I love how different of a challenge it is to backtrack through a zone you've already learned
[0:43:39] <+KennyKRool> idk man dolphins are pretty fucked up. if you have them thumbs, then they would fuck up a ton of shit
[0:43:42] <adimcorner> I believe according to legend. the wheel is how the Roman's killed Saint Cathrine, so that's why they believed it was a holly punishment
[0:43:44] <%CateHecate> @WoolieVersus the other thing people would do was use the wheel as a crucifixion device, tie all your arms and legs to the outer wheel, and then smash your arms and legs right through the spokes in the wheels with a sledge
[0:43:44] <brandt_connors> can't remember are those explosions physical damage or magic?
[0:43:53] <quamdunk> Dolphins and orcas are pretty bad
[0:43:55] <%Deekman> To be fair that's still a day job today
[0:43:58] <pennykettle_> physical I feel like @brandt_connors
[0:43:59] <AbnormalVoid> OHHH YEEEAH
[0:43:59] <Chatterbox1991> that's litterally a thing in history
[0:44:00] <plaguedoctor_vi> you mean Gyro family?
[0:44:00] <urkleturtle> the torture wheel also becomes a weapon in bloodborne, if you remember
[0:44:00] <Crowroost> "sup"
[0:44:01] <%Lion_kun> What do you have against the Zeppeli family Woolie?
[0:44:01] <atlasdotwav> Magic
[0:44:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> SKELETON NINJA
[0:44:05] <Jaysky> Son, it's time to take over the family business
[0:44:05] <+kewlmyc> STEALTH SKELETONS
[0:44:08] <derap41> So fun thing executioners often had to marry within the family because no one wanted to marry en executioner
[0:44:09] <%jepupu> Such gentle moans in Dark Souls 1
[0:44:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> have we encountered Patches yet?
[0:44:12] <Chatterbox1991> Dan Carlin did a whole bit on it
[0:44:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Did he explore down the broken wall there before?
[0:44:18] <owensleftfoot> @ReallyBigRocks yup
[0:44:19] <+セビー> Kreygasm
[0:44:20] <adimcorner> did you know there was a gang of Grave Diggers in Italy during the black death
[0:44:21] <+kewlmyc> @ReallyBigRocks yep
[0:44:23] <pennykettle_> @ReallyBigRocks yes and he may be at risk
[0:44:28] <+KennyKRool> I get to execute people and marry my sister? Sign me up brother KKona
[0:44:29] <%burquina> what the fuck I never found that bonfire LUL
[0:44:33] <seydaq> back at a time like that? you mean 10 years ago in south africa LUL
[0:44:35] <+magusdraco> yeah reggie's been down into the tomb already
[0:44:52] <%Deekman> messages don't prevent shields though do they?
[0:44:52] <+magusdraco> this is the ascent
[0:44:57] <DextralMalin> i see Reggie has the catch pole
[0:45:07] <@Solidus_113> it's +5 too
[0:45:14] <Crowroost> catch pole, get dizzy
[0:45:17] <Kex173> did he get past O&S?
[0:45:19] <DextralMalin> oh dang
[0:45:21] <%Ensign_Epic> @dextralmalin got it off the first demon he fought
[0:45:21] <adimcorner> you really ought to read up on the Religious responses to the black death
[0:45:21] <atlasdotwav> Patches has a sacrifice mark on his neck currently
[0:45:24] <+KennyKRool> So is this the titanite catch pole? I'm a YouTube viewer so I'm behind
[0:45:25] <+magusdraco> no he hasn't been to sen's yet
[0:45:26] <Johannen> @DextralMalin You mean the Power Pole? Kappa
[0:45:29] <+JumboCrunchies> I dont even know what weapon this is
[0:45:34] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I mean, it's pure luck that he even GOT this weapon
[0:45:34] <Xaeveax> You don't see it used often
[0:45:36] <%CateHecate> we're smoking pole
[0:45:36] <%ozzrabbit> Reggie’s honestly not far off from the truth. Being an executioner was often considered to be a family job, one that was both respected and reviled at the same time.
[0:45:38] <pennykettle_> omg, dark souls messages should give small stat bonuses depending on the message, like Death Stranding signs
[0:45:42] <+askalta> is it d/c‽ scaling
[0:45:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> its the catch pole the demon titanite guys use
[0:45:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> like the one outside of Andre
[0:45:59] <%mr_sups> @JumboCrunchies Titanite Catch Pole. The Titanite Demons drop it
[0:46:04] <+magusdraco> catch pole is d/d/d scaling
[0:46:05] <+KennyKRool> Wait
[0:46:05] <+kevlarkoala> Is it fun AND nonconventional, or is it fun BECAUSE it's nonconventional LUL
[0:46:07] <Kex173> didn't even know this pole was a thing you could get
[0:46:13] <+kevlarkoala> because it's Woolie, I suspect I know the answer haha
[0:46:18] <+KennyKRool> This guy got the boar head, murakumo, AND catch pole drops???
[0:46:19] <+magusdraco> (str, dex, int)
[0:46:22] <adimcorner> the Flagilents went from Masochist to Sadist and started murdering anyone they believed to be sinners during the Black Death
[0:46:24] <%holydeviant1> @ozzrabbit hence the hood. But there was a lot of technical aspects, skilled elements. Knowing how much rope you need for a clean, neck-snapping hanging
[0:46:26] <+magusdraco> he also got all the black knight drops
[0:46:27] <+askalta> ty
[0:46:27] <%Ensign_Epic> he's out
[0:46:27] <+JumboCrunchies> Huh, neat. Yeah I dont think I've ever seen it used. Wasn't even sure it could drop.
[0:46:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> has reggie used its R2 much?
[0:46:31] <+TEANTACLES> Did they find the blacksmith yet?
[0:46:38] <BurdRightsActivist> @pennykettle_ Alternative take: you can cash in the positive ratings for extra healing items
[0:46:42] <owensleftfoot> @TEANTACLES yes
[0:46:44] <+magusdraco> that's how reggie got into the bonewheel mess (finding the blacksmith)
[0:46:49] <%Ensign_Epic> unless the bed gets shat particularly hard, he's out
[0:47:06] <HarshNerf> @burdrightsactivist that's too much community engagement for me
[0:47:09] <AbnormalVoid> psycho crusher c'est ce se
[0:47:21] <pennykettle_> Have they done the torpedo move? Haven't seen them do it yet
[0:47:26] <%A_German_spy> karacoLOL
[0:47:27] <+magusdraco> game just provided
[0:47:29] <owensleftfoot> The fuckin palpatine spin
[0:47:30] <Treasure_Vault> Odds on Reggie seeing a vagrant?
[0:47:31] <Crowroost> SO MANY minus frames
[0:47:31] <+lupawnn> skeletons are losers
[0:47:44] <%holydeviant1> @Treasure_Vault with his luck, early Dukes
[0:47:51] <youngking_kush> Aaaaand he's out
[0:47:55] <Xaeveax> This climb up has gone pretty smooth.
[0:48:00] <pennykettle_> hes gonna roll off the cliff
[0:48:06] <%Ensign_Epic> honestly before the streams we should probably all gather and try to force vagrants to spawn where he will be if you want to see a vagrant in the stream
[0:48:07] <+magusdraco> the most likely place he'll see a vagrant is *that* one in anor londo
[0:48:08] <BurdRightsActivist> he's gonna roll off the cliff
[0:48:11] <didipackums1> Freeeeedom
[0:48:13] <%Seancicle> mdr
[0:48:13] <VincentGraves> man if he falls to his death..
[0:48:23] <pennykettle_> I've seen two vagrants in my life
[0:48:23] <Crowroost> not sitting at the bonfire NotLikeThis
[0:48:24] <+aWanderingKaivo> I've seen them more in Anor Londo than anywhere else
[0:48:25] <%CateHecate> almost there
[0:48:25] <atlasdotwav> I remember getting rekt in that room so bad on my climb out
[0:48:26] <JairusHopesItWorks> he should rest right?
[0:48:28] <PartialRecall1> @magusdraco the one on the skinny roof path
[0:48:29] <DextralMalin> how are his stats?  I know there was concern early on in the anime
[0:48:33] <+athuramn> he should've used the bonfire just in case LUK
[0:48:33] <AbnormalVoid> a nice gambit passing that bonfire, let's see if it works out for him
[0:48:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> like 2 or 3 times, vs once in the undead parish
[0:48:35] <+athuramn> LUL
[0:48:35] <justcallmebobplease> PLEASE fuck up and fall just before exit, PLEASE
[0:48:36] <%Ensign_Epic> not sitting at that bonfire is the thing that will bite you in the ass
[0:48:37] <+magusdraco> yes, that's it
[0:48:38] <%MonsieurHonHon> heyo woolie are you gonna try the halo dark soul mod?

[0:51:19] <%holydeviant1> asshole actin like he care
[0:51:24] <brandt_connors> that dialogue sounds different from the original
[0:51:25] <dundore77> lautric did his thing like 2 or 3 sessions ago
[0:51:25] <BigYanno> what a sussy baka he is
[0:51:25] <youngking_kush> Patches should be over by the Graveyard yeah?
[0:51:26] <owensleftfoot> I'm pretty sure he's safe to kill now
[0:51:34] <atlasdotwav> *Falls down the elevator hole*
[0:51:35] <%Ensign_Epic> Patches will only spawn in Firelink after Nito is killed
[0:51:35] <Lefteron> amogus
[0:51:35] <pennykettle_> Oh okay I can confirm its not til after Nito, my bad
[0:51:38] <glass_marcus> Upgrade that shit
[0:51:40] <+aWanderingKaivo> pybro
[0:51:46] <Crowroost> "so i got this pyromancy..."
[0:51:47] <youngking_kush> @ensign_epic Ah
[0:51:47] <%patriotrenegade> Upgrade
[0:51:47] <%Lion_kun> Is it only after Nito?
[0:51:58] <GeoGio3> find domhall
[0:52:06] <pennykettle_> yes after Nito sadly
[0:52:12] <+セビー> petrus is on a ‘timer’ now, i think
[0:52:15] <Johannen> poor laurentius, cokblocked from his dream
[0:52:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> home sweet home
[0:52:17] <%CateHecate> long gone
[0:52:19] <owensleftfoot> Nah he gone
[0:52:19] <Demoli_PT> maybe upgrade that flame
[0:52:20] <%Ensign_Epic> it is most definitely after Nito, it's the main reason why I need to make separate profiles for gravelording
[0:52:23] <brandt_connors> Lautrect has nice armor
[0:52:26] <%patriotrenegade> He has indeed fucked off
[0:52:27] <+DeaconBluesClues> so what is the game state exactly
[0:52:29] <%CateHecate> he had business above
[0:52:33] <BigYanno> yeah if you want to do something about Hair now's the time
[0:52:34] <+magusdraco> he's rung both bells
[0:52:37] <+magusdraco> and then went down the catacombs
[0:52:44] <Crowroost> "lemme take your chick, then imma dip."
[0:52:54] <%CateHecate> I feel like ive said this every single stream he's been in, but: fuck griggs, i hate him SO much
[0:52:59] <pennykettle_> sorcerycucks get out of my Shrine
[0:53:07] <%CateHecate> CIA wizard bullshit
[0:53:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> @CateHecate damn, why the hate?
[0:53:15] <%Ensign_Epic> honestly, grabbing Kindling was a good idea for going forward
[0:53:19] <%holydeviant1> Reggie has already hit the point where 10kish souls are mostly pointless
[0:53:21] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Both of those rings are super worth it for pyromancy
[0:53:26] <Crowroost> Sorcery 4 lyfe, sweatlord meleebears in rooins
[0:53:34] <+aWanderingKaivo> rings in DS1 have such a huge impact
[0:53:34] <BigYanno> there's a good reason ds2 and 3 give you 4 ring slots
[0:53:34] <VincentGraves> those rings suck because they're too good
[0:53:38] <%CateHecate> @CappuccinoGuil smug sorceror, plus the additional lore implications that he is essentially an assasin sent by the wizard CIA
[0:53:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> did he do pinwheel?
[0:54:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> more slots in 2 and 3 but the rings are individually weaker in comparison
[0:54:01] <%Seancicle> oui
[0:54:08] <+DeaconBluesClues> he did, right? wait. did he go all the way through tomb of the giants and get stuck on the lordvessel barrier
[0:54:08] <pennykettle_> probably easier to see going down, too
[0:54:12] <atlasdotwav> Got child mask from pin wheel
[0:54:12] <+DeaconBluesClues> like I did
[0:54:15] <Lefteron> in lore, there used to be fire sorceries but it is a lost art
[0:54:23] <Treasure_Vault> Is Reah on the left here?
[0:54:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> @CateHecate oh wait, am I mixing characters? You talking about the magic blacksmith or the sorcerer guy Reggie just talked to?
[0:54:30] <Crowroost> please die to randos on the way lmao

[1:00:00] <brunoberserk> @pennykettle_  ok thanks
[1:00:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus should we talk about the lore implications of her shop vs petrus' shop?
[1:00:03] <%Lion_kun> These miracles suck
[1:00:08] <%scrumbotime> I do like how Miracles in Dark Souls are all stories and tales as opposed to prayers to god.

[1:00:13] <%Lion_kun> Where are the good ones
[1:00:14] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Fun fact about Force: you can use it to deflect projectiles, including the giant firebombs thrown by the idiot at the top of Sen's Fortress
[1:00:18] <OblivionSword1> WRATH OF THE FUCKING GODS
[1:00:20] <urkleturtle> Force is a hoot when invading in the catacombs

[1:10:23] <%CateHecate> GODS I WAS STRONG THEN
[1:10:24] <kulmoth> ugly boar helmet 😔
[1:10:25] <%patriotrenegade> Look like a nerd
[1:10:26] <youngking_kush> I keep one of every armor set and all the weapons I've upgraded on me always
[1:10:28] <+Bitscreed> I keep outfits on hand so I can change my style at a moment’s notice
[1:10:29] <+aWanderingKaivo> fashion souls increases your player morality stat, absolutely vital
[1:10:30] <pennykettle_> You look like a fuckin NFT
[1:10:33] <RickyRelucent> its not worth rocking it as a quality weapon
[1:10:35] <DSD24> Reggie would do a Luck Build in SMT
[1:10:37] <gryffinp> I don't think the boar helmet is very rare
[1:10:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> morale*
[1:10:39] <BurdRightsActivist> More like reggarth the Boaring
[1:10:40] <%CateHecate> Reggarth is the boar that killed Robert Baratheon
[1:10:43] <yukichocomilk> I hate the helmet LUL
[1:10:45] <DSD24> All points into Luck
[1:10:45] <zzNamttamzz> Big INT needed
[1:10:51] <Jaysky> Lucky Reg
[1:10:51] <%Solidnick18> maybe some dex
[1:10:51] <%patriotrenegade> All that INT NotLikeThis
[1:10:57] <Treasure_Vault> The strongest black knight drop might still be the shield. Get it early and you're invincible.
[1:10:58] <available_line> Reggie will do an actualy Luck build in DS3

[1:11:07] <+セビー> look at all these screamin skulls in chat
[1:11:08] <+Bitscreed> I love the helmet and I hope he never takes it off ever
[1:11:08] <youngking_kush> If you got Pyro no need for INT
[1:11:09] <Crowroost> INT bois BibleThump
[1:11:11] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You're right on that.
[1:11:12] <seydaq> @RickyRelucent putting it on left hand to mke matters worse
[1:11:12] <RickyRelucent> Builds can very a great deal
[1:11:18] <RickyRelucent> some ppl go four kings at sl1
[1:11:18] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus It's easier to specialize in magic than to generalize.
[1:11:23] <RickyRelucent> others snipe with greatbows
[1:11:24] <%vVAstrAVv> BIG BRAIN
[1:11:29] <Ilkim61> both of them at the same time is just inefficient
[1:11:30] <GeoGio3> fuck it pump everything, use whatevere
[1:11:34] <gryffinp> The issue is really attunement slots
[1:11:37] <%Lion_kun> I did a faith/int build in des
[1:11:38] <DSD24> I love the Boar Helmet
[1:11:40] <RickyRelucent> and hide in vases, or with the mist ring/spell
[1:11:44] <%Lion_kun> It was pretty fun.
[1:11:48] <bobxmaker> it's just expensive to go both sorcery and pyromancy.
[1:11:50] <%vVAstrAVv> int is damage woolie
[1:11:55] <Treasure_Vault> You can also get vit and endurance to 40 and ignore damage.
[1:11:57] <haitakaa> Boar helmet is way too heavy to be worth it but it's a nice meme LUL

[1:12:02] <%Lion_kun> Pyromancy is free.
[1:12:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> not for pyro though
[1:12:04] <Jaysky> Pinwheel is the apex boss
[1:12:06] <Duskendawn> Will be super disappointed if woolz doesn't point reg to the MLGS
[1:12:07] <%Solidnick18> Do whatever
[1:12:09] <pennykettle_> Im doing my first SL1 right now, it's SURPRISINGLY easy
[1:12:10] <urkleturtle> there's very limited spell slots available in the game, that's why it's rare to split into two casting schools
[1:12:15] <QueequegTheater> Or just use pyromancy
[1:12:16] <RickyRelucent> @bobxmaker get summoned a few times, kill the boss
[1:12:18] <RickyRelucent> you'll be fine
[1:12:18] <+askalta> 27 str is a good place to stop on a first run
[1:12:25] <youngking_kush> You can do STR + INT for sure
[1:12:26] <%CateHecate> EVEN FURTHER BEYOND
[1:12:28] <AbnormalVoid> High Vit can be really fun, though
[1:12:28] <%Lion_kun> You'd have to invest in attunement
[1:12:30] <%mr_sups> Did someone fart?
[1:12:33] <+twohitgood> my vit was also at 20.

[1:13:07] <%emMmDeeKay> ANDRE goes BRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:13:08] <Xaeveax> They are just taking down all the Blightcon banners.
[1:13:08] <+monfo_the_great> Gotta pay those dues!
[1:13:09] <youngking_kush> It adds to Andre's ambience
[1:13:09] <+DreyfussFrost> 40 END always slept on. Guess it would make the game too easy to be good content Kappa

[1:13:12] <VincentGraves> get 1k health
[1:13:13] <+askalta> you're right 28 strengths is mandatory for kumo

[1:13:19] <FrostedZaibatsu> all good man
[1:13:22] <QueequegTheater> If you're not levelling Int to 50 you may as well not level it at all

[1:13:25] <atlasdotwav> Ewwww vit
[1:13:29] <%vVAstrAVv> reggie strayed from the path
[1:13:37] <+セビー> vit softcap at 30 is fine
[1:13:41] <LunarRemix> Might as well invest in Int since it also increases his attack on top of magic
[1:13:43] <Cozy90> endurance all the way. more rolls. more actions
[1:13:43] <Johannen> But is Reggie's Pole using much strengh thou?
[1:13:45] <%vVAstrAVv> hed litterally hit hard with int with magic weapon
[1:13:46] <AbnormalVoid> one and done is the biggest advantage in the game
[1:13:49] <RickyRelucent> being summoned or summoning is probably the hardest difficulty one can put it on
[1:13:51] <Crowroost> The pole scales off INT too, and it bumps his spells too.... NotLikeThis
[1:13:52] <RickyRelucent> without going ng+
[1:13:52] <pennykettle_> Sens Yeahhhhhhh
[1:13:53] <%Juriasu> *pop*
[1:14:00] <+magusdraco> pole scales poorly off of int, dex, and str
[1:14:00] <+Holmborn> oh reggie got out of the tomb

[1:14:02] <%hiswill98> What all have I missed so far?

[1:14:11] <haitakaa> did he buy the crest?

[1:14:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> endurance is OP in DS1, equipload AND stamina
[1:14:15] <+blink289> reggie needs to try his luck on the halberd black knight
[1:14:23] <oda_flobunaga> Is it Sen or Chihiro, I forget.
[1:14:24] <RickyRelucent> well it is, but i meant it as in your 2 summons wont matter vs more hp +extended moveset
[1:14:25] <Treasure_Vault> Sens is probably the place to be?

[1:22:02] <Rawbone_saw> oh yea that's the catch pole
[1:22:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> wasn't paying close attention did he get it to +10?
[1:22:03] <glass_marcus> these are 5 hitters usually
[1:22:04] <RickyRelucent> :^)
[1:22:05] <pepinillomaton> like 5 swings 1st time I arrived here
[1:22:06] <%CateHecate> the manserpents usually are a huge pain on most of my runs
[1:22:09] <waltzqueen> God Job Hero
[1:22:10] <+lupawnn> can't have shit in sencinnati
[1:22:10] <youngking_kush> "Try Down"
[1:22:12] <fat_burtreynolds> Gib hum the ol 2 handed r2
[1:22:13] <Crowroost> Bold of the vote to assume he reached it in this run
[1:22:13] <RickyRelucent> steel ring!
[1:22:14] <%hax_metatron> It's fantastic that this area doesn't care about how overpowered you are though, you can still get got 100 times
[1:22:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's gonna do even better damage when he cranks some int
[1:22:17] <Rawbone_saw> not as much as demon spear would but it's hot
[1:22:18] <RickyRelucent> so trash lol
[1:22:19] <+DeaconBluesClues> I was stun lockingwith zwei r2
[1:22:20] <pennykettle_> woolie wouldnt do us dirty
[1:22:22] <+liquidzr0> he's not gonna tell him?
[1:22:25] <JetpackMcQuack> look at this gamer
[1:22:26] <gryffinp> It helps a lot that it's +5, i.e. maxed out, rather than +5, i.e. 1/3 of the way to max
[1:22:30] <pennykettle_> I hope the messages fucking dont
[1:22:30] <%CateHecate> close
[1:22:30] <+TEANTACLES> @TEANTACLES respect. i had a tough time there and i only went down after the boss opened
[1:22:31] <RickyRelucent> 50 def in all physicals
[1:22:31] <owensleftfoot> YEYEYE SNAKE TIDDIES
[1:22:34] <RickyRelucent> its really shit
[1:22:34] <pepinillomaton> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:22:37] <+D4C_Trice> @cobalt_phoenix_ that's good.  life happens so it's understandable that people can't meet up
[1:22:38] <DSD24> Snekmen!
[1:22:38] <Wyldesquirrel> These Magic Moments...
[1:22:39] <+Byr0nX> should we tell him?"
[1:22:41] <CrowbarFacelift> he might get tipped off by messages on the ground though
[1:22:42] <+TEANTACLES> why did it reply to me lol
[1:22:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no hesitation
[1:22:45] <%Lordgale119> it's not this room
[1:22:47] <Xaeveax> Oh there are certainly traps
[1:22:47] <OblivionSword1> that's a good one
[1:22:47] <pennykettle_> oh god the messages, I want my points back
[1:22:47] <%Visorak6> GREAT ring
[1:22:49] <%CateHecate> 1
[1:22:50] <%Rafraud> BEST RING BESTRING
[1:22:56] <%Solidnick18> GREAT ring
[1:23:03] <+Byr0nX> just makes sense
[1:23:03] <%Deekman> that ring rules
[1:23:04] <Duskendawn> No hesitation.. yet
[1:23:04] <+D4C_Trice> It's great but it's no FaP
[1:23:05] <available_line> BEST RING.... in ds3
[1:23:07] <Deewtssob> Good ring
[1:23:07] <RickyRelucent> its the ring to go with resistance
[1:23:07] <clack14> boost
[1:23:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's good, but not as good as fap
[1:23:10] <Crowroost> Rendal the OG
[1:23:15] <pepinillomaton> Is no FAP ring but its great
[1:23:22] <%CaptainBeird> isn't a knight king an oxymoron?
[1:23:23] <RickyRelucent> 50defence in the physicals
[1:23:23] <atlasdotwav> What is it 40%?
[1:23:26] <RickyRelucent> sure why not
[1:23:33] <RickyRelucent> literally 0.50
[1:23:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> better than the evil eye for sure
[1:23:42] <subjectg> i’d prefer the poise but eh
[1:23:44] <%holydeviant1> @CaptainBeird It may refer to someone who was, once, a knight, but was raised to kinghood
[1:23:45] <DSD24> @CaptainBeird I mean you can be a king of a non knight kingdom
[1:23:47] <+magusdraco> wolf ring too huh
[1:23:49] <+mechslayer71> naysayers betting on big returns huh Corpa

[1:23:53] <youngking_kush> Blue Tearstone is underrated
[1:23:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit that's good
[1:23:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> +50
[1:24:01] <RickyRelucent> blue tear + red tear meta

[1:24:14] <%CateHecate> NUMBER BIG GO UP?
[1:24:17] <+aWanderingKaivo> its not bad
[1:24:18] <%hax_metatron> LEFT
[1:24:19] <%Visorak6> Its actually like 30%
[1:24:19] <atlasdotwav> Wearing blue tearstone implies you're gonna get rekt
[1:24:20] <RickyRelucent> dark wood + chlo, red tear and blue tear
[1:24:20] <Bonte__> BIG STRONG
[1:24:21] <+MooseIsGoose> go left
[1:24:23] <QueequegTheater> +50, not 50%
[1:24:23] <Crowroost> "Number goes blue, you KNOW what to do."
[1:24:24] <Scorchfield> 50 points, not 50%
[1:24:24] <Equirah> @CaptainBeird no, most kings weren't knighted and it also means it's a knight who became a king rather than getting the position from descendency
[1:24:31] <RickyRelucent> >enjoy
[1:24:32] <pennykettle_> I am gonna be butthurt if he reads the messages lmao

[1:28:03] <+Holmborn> sho n tell
[1:28:05] <DSD24> Shotel's are cool
[1:28:08] <OblivionSword1> good ole Shotel
[1:28:09] <Crowroost> Hilton shotels
[1:28:09] <%holydeviant1> My favorite piece of Dark Souls lore is that Catarina and Astora are the only kingdoms to make it All The Way from 1 to 3
[1:28:11] <haitakaa> man dex weapons are so cool
[1:28:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the curviest of curved swords
[1:28:12] <+TheFrancix> lautrec fuck stick
[1:28:13] <FrostedZaibatsu> Ryu's knife
[1:28:14] <BigYanno> shotel is a cool ass sword
[1:28:14] <subjectg> ya like egypt
[1:28:19] <youngking_kush> Curved. Swords.
[1:28:19] <%CateHecate> like a lot of dark souls weapons, its really cool and also kind of useless
[1:28:20] <clack14> damn look at those curves
[1:28:21] <+eanscrale> Looks like the weapon of a real hero
[1:28:21] <DSD24> Curved Swords
[1:28:23] <Wyldesquirrel> @pennykettle_  the Idea is since Seath is Blind he had another act his designer for the archives/fortress. The Crystal guys gear has no lore but does have an art style that matches the archives
[1:28:23] <BigYanno> EVADES SHIELD
[1:28:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIG CURVED SWORDS
[1:28:28] <justcallmebobplease> HITS THROUGH SHIELD
[1:28:33] <%CateHecate> khopesh
[1:28:34] <agustorm123> They where made to do that
[1:28:35] <KeiganOfAstora> Careeem
[1:28:40] <clack14> tpanimeYGOpuzzle
[1:28:41] <RickyRelucent> they hold it backward tho
[1:28:42] <%holydeviant1> You'll still bounce off the shield, but the damage will land.
[1:28:43] <%Lordgale119> shotels weren't egyptian
[1:28:44] <justcallmebobplease> Would you like to hit THROUGH shields, Reggie?  Laugh at the block?
[1:28:47] <+Byr0nX> "curved sword"
[1:28:48] <%mr_sups> Such a lovely blade

[1:28:58] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus I mean... when you check into Sen's Fortress, you may never check out

[1:36:01] <Wyldesquirrel> now die ot the elevator
[1:36:01] <%notsoy> is the defense ring why he survived?
[1:36:02] <atlasdotwav> Only in ds2

[1:36:08] <%SirGO0SE> i think that spear is pretty alright right away bc magic damage too

[1:36:12] <Equirah> @Wyldesquirrel yup LUL
[1:36:16] <ElBuraindo> TWICE
[1:36:16] <+thereswallace> LOL aight imma try it again
[1:36:16] <EyeDiddleDogz> Mimic-kun
[1:36:17] <fat_burtreynolds> How are you this deep in and not see a mimic
[1:36:17] <subjectg> @rafraud no chests break in ds1, and you’d have to swing many, many times to break a chest in 2
[1:36:17] <pennykettle_> Reggie didn't even have enough eyes on the inside to know that a chest could be a monster
[1:36:17] <+cdrom321> Why twice?!
[1:36:19] <+KennyKRool> Not to be confused with the miracle lightning spear
[1:36:20] <Johannen> He mashed out of it and reset it's sleep
[1:36:23] <%Rafraud> Alot of my DS2 fear seeps into DS1 lol
[1:36:25] <PkSilent01> https://clips.twitch.tv/WrongSpinelessToadDoritosChip-528AyDJxKoywtz3O
[1:36:32] <+mechslayer71> yeah that's just proof Reggie is overleveled tbh. the fact that we got to see him do it again is pretty great tho
[1:36:32] <%SirGO0SE> it kicks ass tho
[1:36:37] <+Babooboomin> !uptime
[1:36:37] <peachy996> So nice you do it tice
[1:36:37] <@Moobot> @Babooboomin WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 45 minutes
[1:36:48] <Duskendawn> No one would open a mimic twice but reggie
[1:36:49] <%Artoo__The_Me> Noooo! I missed Mimic-Kun!
[1:36:50] <+cdrom321> @subjectg Three swings in DS2, in general.
[1:36:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That spear is a free +10, you can downgrade it once and use like a single boss soul to turn it into a boss weapon
[1:36:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so how hard is it to break a chest when testing it?
[1:36:57] <Crowroost> Aight listen, de-level this at Giant Blacksmith to +10, then BAM Moonlight Buttefly Horn
[1:36:58] <available_line> 48 is overleveled?
[1:37:01] <subjectg> i don’t understand how people break chests in ds2 when mimic checking
[1:37:03] <SarcFa> Remember how yesterday people were trashing on Reggie's build? Guess what, look at him demolishing Sens
[1:37:03] <KeiganOfAstora> It goes to +10?
[1:37:03] <+kevlarkoala> @mechslayer71 no such thing as overleveled in Dark Souls unless you're talking about PVP
[1:37:08] <pennykettle_> You can't break chests in this game because its not dumb
[1:37:10] <subjectg> it only takes one swing to check
[1:37:13] <+megaman_sentinel> !uptime
[1:37:14] <@Moobot> @megaman_sentinel WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 45 minutes
[1:37:14] <+KennyKRool> Yeah and you can descend it and use it for boss sousl
[1:37:16] <+foomaster22> 48 is slightly over leveled
[1:37:17] <+askalta> 48 is not overleveled
[1:37:17] <+セビー> cant break chedts in 1
[1:37:22] <clack14> @subjectg yeah that's the tech
[1:37:25] <+foomaster22> Not that much
[1:37:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh didn't know that, great
[1:37:27] <owensleftfoot> lightning damage is so broken in DS1
[1:37:32] <+セビー> 2 is where the true bs of enemies breaking boxes started
[1:37:38] <+KennyKRool> It's a game where you can grind. therefore you can over level
[1:37:45] <+askalta> Reggie could easily be level 60 without grinding if he knew what he was doing
[1:37:46] <+mechslayer71> then again I guess it varies how much one has put into health/ what armor they have
[1:37:48] <clack14> you can also look at the chest to see if it's trying to breathe but forgot which game 🤔
[1:37:51] <available_line> More like he's got the STEEL ring on and Mimic deals physical damage.
[1:37:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:37:59] <subjectg> most of the important shit in 2 was in metal chests anyway
[1:38:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> visions of toothpick
[1:38:08] <+kevlarkoala> theres no such thing as OVER leveling in a PVE game. there's "level to the point you want to level to"
[1:38:09] <+セビー> 2 had breathing mimics, but the chains were the easist tell
[1:38:11] <pennykettle_> incoming
[1:38:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh boy

[1:44:02] <justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy if you kill the Giant feeding in the balls, does that permanently stop the ball mechanic?

[1:44:05] <Crowroost> the second swallow
[1:44:07] <+KennyKRool> whose moving it? Hmm
[1:44:09] <%BisoromiBear> this is what the inside of a chicken machine looks like
[1:44:09] <Deewtssob> Does killing the uh fella at the very top stop it?
[1:44:12] <owensleftfoot> It has certain trigger points depending on where you go
[1:44:13] <%A_German_spy> @justcallmebobplease Until you rest and the giant respawns, yes

[1:44:44] <justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy That giant respawns?  Annoyingly inconsistent given the others don't, but mechanically understandable since the balls are so integral to Sen's Fortress.

[1:45:31] <Deewtssob> Dead
[1:45:32] <justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy I imagine that's because they refused to make it possible to fuck yourself out of Big Hat... and they didn't know about the bug with the wall and the guy.

[1:47:17] <%Ensign_Epic> this is where the game starts saying you better have gotten good at gearing up properly
[1:47:19] <justcallmebobplease> @A_German_spy One other question - it's impossible to both get the Darkwraight set, AND the special Sif cutscene in the same run, right?  Or is there a gimmicky way to force it?
[1:47:21] <JdotSweapA> how many souls was that?
[1:47:21] <RickyRelucent> Nobody, ever does quality magic builds
[1:47:22] <clack14> hey chat can reggie see chat or nah?

[1:47:27] <RickyRelucent> nobodyyy dualwields magic
[1:47:31] <QueequegTheater> @justcallmebobplease only by cheating
[1:47:32] <RickyRelucent> unless its with pyromancy

[1:47:36] <atlasdotwav> 4500ish
[1:47:38] <%patriotrenegade> Reggie needs to pick either pyromancy magic

[1:49:15] <youngking_kush> It's not rare lol
[1:49:16] <+magusdraco> it's sorta rare but not baldr side sword rare
[1:49:18] <RickyRelucent> @subjectg he could buy flamberge off shiva, if he ever runs into him LUL
[1:49:19] <+robertoszek> @pennykettle_ chat just says lucky on every drop, to keep the meme going
[1:49:19] <QueequegTheater> Uncommon, not necessarily rare
[1:49:19] <%Ensign_Epic> it's really not that rare of a drop
[1:49:19] <yukichocomilk> you kill so many of them you always get it
[1:49:20] <urkleturtle> it's not that rare but very good
[1:49:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you get it sooner or later, unless you REALLY blaze throught sens
[1:49:25] <Frostilk> more like uncommon, maybe
[1:49:26] <Deewtssob> It’s not that rare
[1:49:27] <BigYanno> also there are quite a lot of man-serpents to drop one
[1:49:35] <%holydeviant1> It's a nice big curved sword fast-ish
[1:49:35] <RickyRelucent> u could
[1:49:39] <%patriotrenegade> It’s more common than any Black Knight stuff
[1:49:39] <atlasdotwav> Your gameclock is rolling 777's
[1:49:40] <%hax_metatron> Lol yeah and with how many times I repeated Sen's Fortress on my first few runs of the game, I got that sword like so many times
[1:49:40] <Deewtssob> Yeah uncommon
[1:49:41] <RickyRelucent> just join the forest cov
[1:49:42] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah there are a lot lol
[1:49:42] <SarcFa> spend any good length of time in Sens killing snakes, you're almost guaranteed that sword
[1:49:43] <pennykettle_> 2% drop rate according to the wiki
[1:49:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Everybody winds up killing like 50 lizard dudes going through here
[1:49:44] <justcallmebobplease> @cdrom321 I assumed it was an enemy-only weapon, which in hindsight was a poor assumption.
[1:49:45] <brunoberserk> i tried to farm this damn sword for ONE HOUR
[1:49:47] <RickyRelucent> and warp to blight town
[1:49:48] <RickyRelucent> later
[1:49:56] <youngking_kush> I would say then use either / or
[1:49:59] <RickyRelucent> talk to shiva
[1:50:00] <DextralMalin> oh snap, it's sens funhouse
[1:50:02] <%vVAstrAVv> itll be relevant if you go to THE FOREST

[1:51:16] <+magusdraco> yeah reggie's damage issue right now is that his weapon is maxed, his pyro hand and his int are not
[1:51:18] <Deewtssob> 80% of it already
[1:51:18] <Quack_of_Dawn> Did he get mimic'd?  They reach that yet?

[1:51:39] <+druupy_> PROTECC
[1:51:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Quack_of_Dawn he did, LIVED, then did it again, then lived AGAIN, and finally he hit it
[1:51:41] <gryffinp> @magusdraco his pyro hand is as maxed as is reasonable for sen's fortress, he just never uses it

[2:06:42] <subjectg> Only demons and ds2
[2:06:42] <+cavefishes> you don't even have to time it since DS preloads your inputs

[2:35:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat i've never done much magic in this, is the damage bad because his int is low, or because they resist it?
[2:35:23] <Dannzzyy> We all suffered here man
[2:35:24] <SixthShinx> The place where everybody know you're fuuuuuuucked
[2:35:36] <kulmoth> @cobalt_phoenix_ they jusst blocked with the shield
[2:35:36] <%Fefe41> Having fun isn't hard
[2:35:40] <%Fefe41> When you got a library card
[2:35:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ ah
[2:35:44] <pennykettle_> kids 6 and under eat free
[2:35:45] <bruuzer12> Sen is a fucker, whoever he is
[2:35:56] <+askalta> aye
[2:35:56] <%vVAstrAVv> @cobalt_phoenix_ magics mostly made my magic boosting items reggie has missed
[2:35:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh my god another one
[2:35:57] <%A_German_spy> @cobalt_phoenix_ Partly low INT, partly no spell damage boosts like Bellowing Dragoncrest, partly low base damage on the spell he's using, partly he's using a starting catalyst
[2:35:57] <%knivesatmidnight> PUNISHED FORTRESS
[2:35:58] <+Stormiercashew> Sens Fortress when you're here you're family
[2:36:01] <tolloponik> just don't look at the staff for too long they get jumpy
[2:36:01] <%starplatinumround> did reggie find buds?
[2:36:03] <SixthShinx> Anotha one
[2:36:05] <Tempmael> can dual wield now
[2:36:07] <brunoberserk> TWO ? REEEEEEE
[2:36:09] <rasamune> sen with a dfuck house
[2:36:15] <pennykettle_> its 2% chance, its pretty easy to find unless you only run through once
[2:36:22] <Treasure_Vault> Lizard dudes also have better magic resist than fire or lightning, IIRC.
[2:36:24] <+Forente> Snek Man
[2:36:43] <+セビー> ive run a few magic builds, you either go with a massive amount of small arrows, or a handful of BIG ones.. but he’s sitting in the middle
[2:37:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nice
[2:37:26] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:37:26] <+HumanDoctor> nailed it
[2:37:32] <AbnormalVoid> ball of force
[2:37:34] <Tempmael> can't peek those tusks out too far
[2:37:49] <%Dakuu75> sometimes you need a little top-off to feel save
[2:37:54] <%Dakuu75> security top-off
[2:38:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @セビー see that's what i don't get, with magic you have big hits but limited amounts, so what do you do when you run out?
[2:38:05] <+robertoszek> I don't think Reggie processes the info Woolie drops sometimes because he's too concentrated
[2:38:07] <ElBuraindo> why is the machine reset?
[2:38:09] <agustorm123> You hit box is too big Boar man
[2:38:11] <+Reverend_Roscoe> safety sip
[2:38:21] <%CaptainBeird> or you know take the inteded safer path
[2:38:26] <+セビー> @cobalt_phoenix_ use an int-scaling weapon, usually
[2:38:45] <+セビー> ranged magic isnt the primary weapon, its just another tool
[2:38:50] <+HumanDoctor> now the ez part is done...
[2:38:59] <%Dakuu75> there's that fuck-o
[2:39:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @セビー ah, i always thought magic was, you know, mostly pew pews
[2:39:13] <%vVAstrAVv> @cobalt_phoenix_ theres an ember that makes weapons scale with int and weapon buff spells so melees still pretty viable
[2:39:17] <+セビー> ie, cheesing undead dragon with 40 soul arrows
[2:39:27] <jojomzo> snek
[2:39:30] <%Dakuu75> don't get Plague, up in here woolz. We'll get weird.

[2:39:57] <%Ensign_Epic> you cannot use buff spells on weapons that are ascensded into an elemental path

[2:40:15] <%fetrigon> nice
[2:40:16] <+セビー> woolie’s early advice was solid, you usually run 2 stats, and dex/int is a good pick

[2:48:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @James_Quivers you poor soul
[2:48:45] <subjectg> Playing offline really hampers your ability to find this stuff
[2:48:45] <KyberNasse> Reggie getting a shell shock from those firebombs
[2:48:53] <Dabrikishaw> How has Sens been for Reggie?
[2:48:55] <SaintBeau> LUL
[2:49:00] <@Solidus_113> I didn't find it on my first either
[2:49:01] <%Supermonaman> strength basically does nothing now It looks like at least.
[2:49:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Dabrikishaw an absolute delight
[2:49:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I used a wiki lol
[2:49:07] <%starplatinumround> too long
[2:49:12] <%Josef_Stryker> I wonder how many found it by accident
[2:49:14] <%Ensign_Epic> y'all are blind AF XD
[2:49:16] <Monkeyweed21> its so absurdly hidden compared to almost every other bonfire
[2:49:23] <Deewtssob> That’s rough lol

[2:49:26] <+ElDragon_1> I definitely didnt the first time

[2:49:28] <%ozzrabbit> Raise your hand if you are hoping that Woolie will advise Reggie to summon THE BOY
[2:49:29] <Dabrikishaw> @Dabrikishaw Good to know he's having fun after how dreadful the last stream was

[2:49:38] <bruuzer12> Berenkite Bois
[2:49:40] <%Ensign_Epic> fun fact there is a second bonfire in the catacombs that you probably haven't found if you haven't found this bonfire

[2:50:19] <%hax_metatron> Undead Burg
[2:50:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> many walls
[2:50:28] <+HumanDoctor> he gunna die 2 times before tarkus
[2:50:29] <available_line> Bell Tower
[2:50:30] <SaintBeau> he needs to be human for it tho
[2:50:34] <GoogleyGareth> Under-map geometry, beautiful
[2:50:34] <NumbF4ke> Let him look through the area first, he might die before he gets evwn close to tarkus, no need to waste humanity
[2:50:36] <didipackums1> The Fortress in the Fortress
[2:50:38] <%CateHecate> woah that wall layout looks....weird

[2:52:01] <%DegenCat> baller swelm
[2:52:01] <RickyRelucent> all you need is fangboar
[2:52:01] <Lefteron> not bad
[2:52:02] <didipackums1> Baller helm

[2:52:06] <clack14> the honest foozies
[2:52:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:52:10] <+TheFrancix> fuck
[2:52:18] <Klefth> Actually, Woolie, people have gone through the hitboxes in the game and it all mostly connects pretty neatly
[2:52:22] <+セビー> woolie questioned him raising vit over 20, now look wheat reggie is doing
[2:52:22] <+TheFrancix> FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT
[2:52:23] <RyuuAoi> Luck in DS. Luck in DJ...who Reggie praying to morning and night?
[2:52:28] <SaintBeau> wait, he already did the catacombs???
[2:52:30] <SaintBeau> madman
[2:52:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Reggie should play the lottery, shit
[2:52:33] <+セビー> what*
[2:52:35] <subjectg> this thing is absolute trash
[2:52:42] <Lefteron> shame it is terrible
[2:52:42] <Deewtssob> It stinks
[2:52:45] <tolloponik> Fun Fact: its designed after golden Age Guts Helmet
[2:52:47] <Xaeveax> Not a very good one to be honest
[2:52:51] <emptyantics> Too bad it sucks
[2:52:51] <Dabrikishaw> The Baldur Armor is great for a Guts roleplay. I'm actually doing a Guts Mode run right now
[2:52:55] <RickyRelucent> it looks the part
[2:52:55] <subjectg> it’s a really big shame because it looks so cool
[2:53:00] <royb2> All of it doesnt
[2:53:02] <@Solidus_113> There's only like 2 zones that don't make sense
[2:53:03] <LunarRemix> Shut up
[2:53:03] <BurdRightsActivist> EXCEPT FOR ONE.
[2:53:05] <urkleturtle> yeah a lot of the geometry is totally real. i could once see my bloodstain in darkroot garden from the church rooftop
[2:53:05] <BlueEagle2395> LUL
[2:53:05] <royb2> most of it does
[2:53:06] <OblivionSword1> DS2 is cheating
[2:53:07] <waltzqueen> SHUT UP
[2:53:09] <youngking_kush> It definitely lies sometimes lol
[2:53:10] <BlueEagle2395> Alright you got that one
[2:53:10] <Klefth> Mostly*
[2:53:10] <+magusdraco> @WoolieVersus there's somep laces that absolutely lie like tomb of the giants --> demon's ruins
[2:53:14] <Quack_of_Dawn> DS2 is the most silly
[2:53:15] <LeeOhX> expose their lies Woolie
[2:53:16] <+Jiggisnipe> gotta lie sometimes
[2:53:22] <%CateHecate> ohhhh fuck i only just now thought about how the crystal caves connect to NOTHING
[2:53:26] <RickyRelucent> yeyeyeyeye
[2:53:27] <emptyantics> Expose then Woolie LUL
[2:53:29] <tacostarvedbeast> Woolie pondering his geometry I see
[2:53:30] <%Fefe41> Blackface
[2:53:31] <clack14> LUL
[2:53:33] <emptyantics> *them
[2:53:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[2:53:34] <Monkeyweed21> the distance between Tombs,Izalith, and Ash Lake are also nonsense
[2:53:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[2:53:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:53:38] <RickyRelucent> >close the visor
[2:53:41] <+Jiggisnipe> ,LUL
[2:53:42] <tolloponik> can guts will sue if you caould
[2:53:44] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:53:44] <%mr_sups> Go back to the BOAR
[2:53:44] <RickyRelucent> this isn't WoW
[2:53:48] <+セビー> the zone boxes connect, the scale of scenery is exaggerated
[2:53:48] <urkleturtle> gotta look at that raisin
[2:53:49] <clack14> 🐷
[2:53:52] <Xaeveax> The geometry in Bloodborne is also quite hilarious sometimes, but the world is so dense that it's not as obvious.
[2:53:54] <%CateHecate> We're all hogs waiting for our slop
[2:53:58] <Bathezid> the elite knight helmet is just the knight helmet with the visor closed
[2:54:00] <%sewermonk> apparently Firelink viewed from Blighttown actually uses an old level geometry of it
[2:54:01] <%livlinn> But the boarrrr shiaCry
[2:54:01] <Wyldesquirrel> Souls Geometry is the illusion of truth while only being 80%ish accurate, each game has visual tricks to enforce this
[2:54:03] <%A_German_spy> You know what, I agree. I DO wish you could close the visors on these helmets
[2:54:03] <%xcompleasedad> Hey, the boar helm is fucking COOL
[2:54:05] <%livlinn> shiaHypers shiaHypers shiaHypers
[2:54:07] <ThisIsLloyd> one :)
[2:54:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> oink oink :)
[2:54:17] <%CateHecate> gods i was strong then
[2:54:20] <Deewtssob> Are you telling me the areas near the end of the game lie about the zone spacing? I wonder why
[2:54:26] <zetaplus> @Xaeveax it fits the lovecraft setting too
[2:54:26] <RickyRelucent> steel and golem armor soon
[2:54:29] <+HelloImTom08> 🐷 🛡️
[2:54:29] <RickyRelucent> poggers
[2:54:32] <%DegenCat> wait hold up which helm has multiple states?
[2:54:33] <Xaeveax> @zetaplus Indeed
[2:54:35] <didipackums1> Nothing matters anymore once you get tarkus armor EZ
[2:54:42] <agustorm123> @CateHecate MORE WINE
[2:54:42] <+セビー> witches set in 2 maybe?
[2:54:44] <Lefteron> time to due
[2:54:47] <Deewtssob> What could’ve possibly happened I wonder lol
[2:54:47] <@Solidus_113> the boy
[2:54:48] <Lefteron> duel
[2:54:51] <%mr_sups> Ricard
[2:54:51] <RickyRelucent> tarkus armor is in anor londo tho
[2:54:52] <%swesterly> Wait which helm has 2 states
[2:54:56] <subjectg> RAPHAEL
[2:54:58] <OblivionSword1> fancy motherfucker
[2:54:59] <Wyldesquirrel> @didipackums1 by that logic you can nullify the game as early as Havel
[2:55:01] <%debrv> @didipackums1 .... You mean Mr. Havel's Armor
[2:55:02] <glass_marcus> Ricky with the moves
[2:55:02] <%townzzzzz> duel on top
[2:55:04] <+HumanDoctor> nice
[2:55:05] <Deewtssob> Richard
[2:55:06] <youngking_kush> HAVE AT THEE
[2:55:06] <subjectg> NO TURNING BACK

[2:55:10] <dizimous> Dick
[2:55:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:55:13] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus So another fun fact here: in 1.0, before the game was ever patched, the firebomb guy would lead his shots, and throw the firebombs AHEAD of you, so they were almost impossible to avoid. Just want Reggie to know how good he's got it now LUL
[2:55:13] <clack14> rest in power
[2:55:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EPIC SWORD

[3:13:36] <RyuuAoi> No. Let Reggie suffer
[3:13:37] <Quack_of_Dawn> We're all in a cage when you think about it :)

[3:14:09] <%Deekman> nothing compares to this in the other souls games
[3:14:10] <+セビー> (actual experience i had)

[3:14:47] <%fat_burtreynolds> Get whackin
[3:15:02] <gryffinp> still very nice to have the upper fire when dodging the bombs
[3:15:04] <+セビー> whacking day BibleThump
[3:15:07] <JetpackMcQuack> listen.exe
[3:15:18] <%Josef_Stryker> Does the Titanite Pole have any special properties. Any reason Reggie decided to stick with it?
[3:15:22] <+Jiggisnipe> it's a luxury bonfire
[3:15:22] <RickyRelucent> ehhhh
[3:15:28] <RickyRelucent> ash lake would be to differ
[3:15:31] <+セビー> @josef_stryker some int scaling
[3:15:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> Like the 2nd most hidden
[3:15:32] <%Josef_Stryker> Nothing wrong with him using it
[3:15:33] <@Solidus_113> not counting hidden zones
[3:15:34] <TheRaubvogel> @Josef_Stryker Magic damage and scaling
[3:15:35] <RickyRelucent> beg*
[3:15:35] <%Josef_Stryker> I was just wondering
[3:15:35] <+magusdraco> it's half magic and half physical.  otherwise he stuck with it since he liked it
[3:15:37] <%Josef_Stryker> I see
[3:15:40] <%Double_Tap_That> @Josef_Stryker Deals magic damage and scales with INT, which he's leveling
[3:15:44] <%CaptainBeird> eh darkmoon tomb of the top of my head is worse
[3:15:45] <%holydeviant1> wait, shouldn't that wall be open?!
[3:15:48] <FrostedZaibatsu> 3rd maybe
[3:15:56] <TheButtravage> @Josef_Stryker I think he picked it because it has some int scaling and he likes the idea of playing as a spellsword.
[3:16:02] <%Josef_Stryker> @holydeviant1 U need a boulder to open it
[3:16:11] <%fat_burtreynolds> Has he been scaling dex? Cause unless he’s spamming magic on the pole, his numbers would do enough damage
[3:16:11] <%holydeviant1> @Josef_Stryker he did
[3:16:16] <RickyRelucent> no spawn at the top olol

[3:16:42] <%fat_burtreynolds> Reg turn around!
[3:16:52] <+terry_quest> where is he going?
[3:17:02] <+RemedyofRevenge> Actually true, you can get smoke break snake to break the wall
[3:17:07] <RickyRelucent> guys, he could've jumped at the ledge to the giant and fallen down
[3:17:12] <RickyRelucent> drop down to the lever
[3:17:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @terry_quest he's gonna turn the ball to smash the wall
[3:17:15] <RickyRelucent> then walk to logan
[3:17:19] <RickyRelucent> but this is more fun
[3:17:23] <+terry_quest> ohh yea you can do that
[3:17:28] <@Solidus_113> think about content Kappa
[3:17:32] <+セビー> its fine.. this is fine
[3:17:32] <oda_flobunaga> Countdown to death 10

[3:17:41] <oda_flobunaga> 6
[3:17:42] <%Double_Tap_That> @RickyRelucent Bro, you backseat like you wanna play the game yourself.
[3:17:45] <+Titsmcgheeee> speedrun tech baby

[3:18:01] <%Fefe41> Wait why is he running all the way back up
[3:18:09] <iamtheTwitchghost> eat a humanity maybe?
[3:18:16] <%Deekman> @Fefe41 I was thinking the same thing
[3:18:16] <+セビー> tbf, the boulder can combo vit 30 to death in a single pass
[3:18:19] <RickyRelucent> @Double_Tap_That fair criticism, just trying to give woolz all the tools he can use
[3:18:34] <RickyRelucent> it helps reggie is preoccupied
[3:18:37] <stevenellis386> hey this was my same build way back then.
[3:18:37] <@Solidus_113> Woolie just replayed the game, he knows what to do. also Spy is here in a pinch
[3:18:43] <%Ensign_Epic> that's why you got to roll into the Boulder, so it doesn't combo you
[3:19:12] <%Ensign_Epic> rolling into the Boulder and then running straight up usually allows you to get into the room with minimal issues, so long as you can take one hit from the boulder
[3:19:16] <+Jiggisnipe> lol

[3:24:07] <+Jiggisnipe> Reggie thought he was a ghost
[3:24:15] <%Ensign_Epic> I don't think he knows the safe route
[3:24:15] <%fat_burtreynolds> Ddddddmaxima
[3:24:15] <+セビー> @vvastravv reggie has run it, so yeah..
[3:24:17] <RickyRelucent> guess he'd take dmg better
[3:24:24] <RickyRelucent> being mid or heavyy
[3:24:27] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus You want to roll, not jump. The jump is hard to control and has no i-frames. You can still just barely make it with middle durability as long as you hug the wall on your right to minimize your travel distance.
[3:24:40] <%CaptainBeird> woolie do you not know there's a safe route anymore?
[3:24:52] <%AbnormalVoid> shitty floor hitboxes giving bad information
[3:24:57] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Er, middle equip weight
[3:24:57] <%Dopamien> dont you take more dmg mid jump too?
[3:24:59] <+MrCircleStrafe> daily youtube dark souls is the best at the minute, thanks for everything you do gents
[3:25:00] <subjectg> i don’t think reggie realizes that he cannot roll during a sprint
[3:25:01] <RyuuAoi> No jumping, Reggie. This ain't Elden Ring.
[3:25:13] <urkleturtle> in fact you take MORE damage while jumping
[3:25:14] <RickyRelucent> always a pleasure spy
[3:25:25] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus Holding your shield up will prevent you from jumping and will queue a roll instead if you only want rolls.
[3:25:40] <+セビー> @thebuttravage was just thinking that
[3:25:45] <%A_German_spy> @subjectg He can, but they'd have to rebind the jump input from Circle to R3
[3:25:47] <%fat_burtreynolds> Reggie move the balls and drop down on tha snek
[3:26:02] <Lefteron> both missed
[3:26:08] <%A_German_spy> @RickyRelucent charly23Hi
[3:26:09] <warpiscute> did he free logan?

[3:26:18] <RickyRelucent> *blush*
[3:26:25] <%Irridium> he did free logan yes
[3:26:27] <TheButtravage> @subjectg If you hold block you can roll while holding sprint.

[3:27:56] <%Ensign_Epic> I found you 10 actually roll out of a run you just need to time it incredibly precisely. Like literally the moment the running transitions into walking
[3:28:01] <+セビー> in a world with magic, how would mages not make top notch assassins or thieves
[3:28:07] <RickyRelucent> @CateHecate and that a body in  a barrel with the normal set was right next to him
[3:28:11] <TheButtravage> @subjectg I mean you just hold up your shield when you want to roll, holding up the shield keeps you from jumping, it only queues rolls instead.

[3:33:36] <emptyantics> TARKUS
[3:33:38] <@Solidus_113> don't summon him out of spite
[3:33:40] <gryffinp> forget tarkus, tarkus is a bitch who died to gravity
[3:33:40] <+robertoszek> @WoolieVersus reeeeee LUL
[3:33:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> You could alway backstab every enemy too woolieGLORY
[3:33:46] <BurdRightsActivist> !TARKUS FORGOTTEN!

[3:33:58] <RickyRelucent> I would, but reggie has that on lock
[3:34:02] <Tempmael> forgot about tarkus kappa
[3:34:03] <%RyTYoung> Tarkus rn NotLikeThis
[3:34:07] <%hax_metatron> He still has to kill fire giant chill chat
[3:34:08] <+セビー> gravity didnt kill him, it was the kill box just above the floor.. NotLikeThis
[3:34:08] <emptyantics> TARKUS LUL
[3:34:13] <%debrv> tarkus....
[3:34:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Solidus_113 >:(
[3:34:14] <%hax_metatron> There's more game so chill chat
[3:34:17] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus It was like, the biggest highlight of your first playthrough lol
[3:34:18] <%CaptainBeird> you looked right at it
[3:34:18] <+Jiggisnipe> I don't think people yelling Tarkus to remind Woolie but are just doing the Tarkus chant
[3:34:19] <%Double_Tap_That> Doesn't Hush also reduce fall damage, or am I thinking of a different spell?
[3:34:24] <emptyantics> @solidus_113 Someone’s salty PJSalt PJSalt
[3:34:29] <%Ensign_Epic> you're thinking of different spell double tap
[3:34:29] <warpiscute> if tarkus is so good why is he dead
[3:34:31] <gryffinp> that was an extra good explosion noise
[3:34:34] <octotasty> isn't any Magic +5 weapon better than the catchpole?
[3:34:37] <%tank7013> Watch Tarkus die immediately and disappoint everyone
[3:34:42] <%hax_metatron> @warpiscute Couldn't even walk on the rafters of Anor Lonndo
[3:34:43] <@Solidus_113> I'm not the one losing their shit over a summon
[3:34:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Jiggisnipe most yea, but some are like panicking he's not gonna do it
[3:34:47] <youngking_kush> Gravity is the enemy of us all
[3:34:48] <TheButtravage> @Double_Tap_That Fall Control, entirely different spell, I think Hush and Fall Control are combined into one spell in DS3 though.
[3:34:49] <%Ensign_Epic> I think it's literally called fall control in ds1
[3:34:52] <+セビー> @octotasty doesnt have the embers
[3:35:05] <octotasty> @セビー he does
[3:35:16] <BlueEagle2395> yeah reggie's still got some bits to explore in this zone still
[3:35:17] <octotasty> You have the Magic Ember by default
[3:35:20] <Wyldesquirrel> I think Tarkus could beat gravity in a 2 out of 3, gravity just got lucky and he lost his footing is all
[3:35:20] <octotasty> on Rickert
[3:35:20] <dalmek> he clocked out
[3:35:32] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:35:33] <+セビー> @octotasty does he? oh.. was thinking of enchanted

[3:35:51] <emptyantics> LUL LUL LUL
[3:35:51] <SaintBeau> LOL
[3:35:52] <%Lordgale119> @Wyldesquirrel he fights gravity and wins every time he takes a step in that armor
[3:35:53] <SaintBeau> LUL
[3:35:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's karma
[3:35:54] <%RyTYoung> Lucky Reg and Lucky Ted combined
[3:35:59] <subjectg> I think the main draw of the catch pole is that it’s pretty easy to max in comparison to maxing a magic weapon
[3:36:02] <pochecito> Luck ran out
[3:36:04] <+dj_berserk_ix> atpRtsd
[3:36:04] <DeathByPoke7> LUL
[3:36:05] <+Jiggisnipe> not so lucky

[3:36:15] <%livlinn> shiaDingus shiaDingus shiaDingus
[3:36:19] <%Bread_Assassin> Sen’s Fortress should unionize. This has done awful working conditions
[3:36:21] <RickyRelucent> catch pole is pog
[3:36:23] <RickyRelucent> y'all haters
[3:36:33] <emptyantics> The Pole is a fun weapon
[3:36:44] <available_line> Is there anything left to explore? NotLikeThis
[3:36:44] <%Double_Tap_That> @subjectg It's also has a halberd moveset, which is pretty versatile.
[3:36:45] <MinersLoveGames> halberd ftw
[3:36:46] <TheButtravage> @subjectg Depends on how many lizards you get early. If he has been to the great Hollow you pretty much get enough to max out like two twinkling weapons.
[3:37:19] <RickyRelucent> @TheButtravage could go to ash lake and get tons of the fuckers
[3:37:20] <%fat_burtreynolds> Bet reg is gonna end up with enchanted Zwei against gwyn
[3:37:22] <%Ensign_Epic> yeah twinkling titanite weapons are enough to easily get you into the higher weapon matching ranges very quickly
[3:37:22] <+セビー> i wonder if reggie would prefer magic weapon the spell, or the enhancement..
[3:37:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1460530098050945027?s=20
[3:37:23] <subjectg> Yeah twinkling weapons can be pretty cool, i ran with the silver knight sword one time and it does really good damage
[3:37:31] <%mr_sups> Larry is worse
[3:37:34] <dundore77> some a smoker named gregg i feel personally attacked
[3:37:36] <peachy996> they both suck
[3:37:39] <%Dopamien> Who would work here. actually I would, looks like a fun place :)
[3:37:40] <leomuratore> At least he is there
[3:37:43] <emptyantics> Larry is worse
[3:37:43] <+Sir_Louis> Gregs union he knows his rights
[3:37:45] <TheButtravage> @RickyRelucent Yeah, I don't really consider the three clams to be a good farm.
[3:37:48] <%CateHecate> why are we still running the lower levels of sens....? what is even left in here
[3:37:51] <tolloponik> wrong Ted that forgets where the checks are
[3:37:52] <+dj_berserk_ix> Woo!
[3:37:55] <Treasure_Vault> Might be worth to sit at andre, more sips and shortcut
[3:37:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CateHecate he's checking out a side area
[3:38:02] <RickyRelucent> @TheButtravage they're there i guess shrug
[3:38:03] <peachy996> I'd rather have the one who isn't there then the one who showed up to do fuck all
[3:38:03] <%Seancicle> SingsMic you may have clocked in, but you never checked in
[3:38:17] <RickyRelucent> starts adding up if u gert lucky
[3:38:28] <%Ensign_Epic> Ash Lake is like... worst case scenario for twinkling titanite farming
[3:38:37] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[3:38:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dam
[3:38:39] <TheButtravage> @RickyRelucent I'd rather get the 10 lizards in the hollow on the way down and ignore the clams.
[3:38:41] <SoaringTrumpet> LUL
[3:38:41] <subjectg> The only downside i can think of for the catch pole is that you can’t buff it. Once we get a strong magic buff we could go for a magic weapon instead
[3:38:45] <RickyRelucent> @Ensign_Epic its shitty if u dont have warp, true
[3:38:46] <%Ensign_Epic> if you really want to farm it manually just beat seath and teleport to that bonfire where there is like eight of the clams
[3:38:46] <emptyantics> @ensign_epic How do you farm it at Ash Lake?
[3:38:48] <+セビー> idk, farming lake wasnt so bad if you just run the 2 near the bonfire
[3:39:02] <youngking_kush> Today on WoolieVS, Reggie shares needles with a Snake-man
[3:39:03] <+セビー> i farmed for unique armor upgrades for ng+
[3:39:06] <%hax_metatron> Yes you basically roll through the ball
[3:39:11] <Pie_Mastyr> you can roll while running if you are blocking
[3:39:12] <%Dopamien> i-frame the ball calebKek
[3:39:13] <subjectg> It’s also far easier to get souls to buy twinkling from the giant blacksmith
[3:39:14] <DeathByPoke7> you can also back step through the Boulder but you take damage
[3:39:17] <%AbnormalVoid> twinkling is farmed from clams
[3:39:25] <octotasty> did he get the Oolacile Catalyst at least?
[3:39:30] <%Ensign_Epic> @emptyantics clams
[3:39:31] <+magusdraco> no
[3:39:36] <nxflre> Reggie sure is taking his time with Sens lmao
[3:39:39] <%hax_metatron> YES YOU CAN LUL
[3:39:40] <RickyRelucent> @octotasty think he got that yeah
[3:39:41] <emptyantics> @ensign_epic Ah ok
[3:39:43] <+セビー> @octotasty ivory one? hasnt seen hydra
[3:39:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PARRY THE BOULDEWR
[3:39:44] <yukichocomilk> fuck that LUL
[3:39:46] <+Sir_Louis> Just Trickster it 4Head
[3:39:46] <+BignanasTheGawd> Block while running then it’s easier to roll I think
[3:39:47] <%hax_metatron> That's what speedrunners do
[3:39:48] <RickyRelucent> but the staff, not the bush
[3:39:58] <%Ensign_Epic> like seriously it's probably more cost effective to farm souls and then by the twinkling titanite than it is to actually manually farm it
[3:40:00] <Tempmael> nah we big dick energy in here
[3:40:02] <+mitchpitchfork> thats how I do it
[3:40:09] <DeathByPoke7> it's the only decent use I have for the back step super armor
[3:40:14] <%MonsieurHonHon> did hekill the big man downstairs?
[3:40:14] <tolloponik> you can actually High Time the bolder to
[3:40:16] <+Genericmistake> I just got here chat, did he have his first run in with a mimic yet?
[3:40:22] <%MonsieurHonHon> yes he did
[3:40:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Genericmistake ye
[3:40:24] <FrostedZaibatsu> THEY have never backstepped the boulder. They only saw people like Lobos do it
[3:40:25] <%MonsieurHonHon> it was great
[3:40:25] <+Genericmistake> nice
[3:40:26] <+canseesea> @Genericmistake he tanked that shit twice
[3:40:27] <available_line> vasectomy performed
[3:40:28] <RickyRelucent> @Ensign_Epic anyything can happen if u dont need ur pockert souls for lvls or weapons
[3:40:30] <LoreKeeper_Thal> LUL
[3:40:30] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus I mean you can reverse backstep through boulders so you don't get knocked down but you still take damage. I wouldn't recommend since it's advanced tech.
[3:40:33] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[3:40:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hey just as a dumb question but, does going human in this game give you a bigger life bar or just big heal
[3:40:44] <%hax_metatron> GOOD ring
[3:40:45] <SaintBeau> waynerHmm
[3:40:49] <Tempmael> just 360 noscope the boulder
[3:40:50] <%AbnormalVoid> ResidentSleeper Ring
[3:40:53] <%MonsieurHonHon> you dont get more hp as human in DS
[3:40:54] <MinersLoveGames> I have never seen someone backstep through the boulders.
[3:40:54] <%townzzzzz> tiny feet sounds
[3:40:55] <%Lordgale119> @fat_burtreynolds neither
[3:40:55] <youngking_kush> Fuck it, Reggie gotta play the rest of the game with a Wii Mote
[3:40:56] <%king_wragles> @fat_burtreynolds More life
[3:40:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @fat_burtreynolds i think it's just the ability to summon
[3:40:57] <%MonsieurHonHon> you get more res I think
[3:40:57] <$eco419> Zzzz
[3:40:59] <+magusdraco> Hush forever
[3:41:00] <TheButtravage> @fat_burtreynolds Going human just triggers online activity.
[3:41:03] <%CateHecate> ResidentSleeper
[3:41:04] <Bathezid> my favorite ring :)
[3:41:07] <%Ensign_Epic> @monsieurhonhon yes you totally do get more HP
[3:41:08] <%debrv> @fat_burtreynolds Big heal and a Resist Boost.
[3:41:09] <RickyRelucent> the ring lasts forever
[3:41:09] <octotasty> @fat_burtreynolds the only benefit is PvP/Co-Op
[3:41:10] <SaintBeau> Real Gs Move In Silence Like Lasagna
[3:41:11] <RickyRelucent> spell is timed
[3:41:25] <%MonsieurHonHon> @Ensign_Epic I meant DaS
[3:41:27] <subjectg> @saintbeau is your name what i think it is? crossroad-candle?
[3:41:29] <%MonsieurHonHon> not DeS
[3:41:29] <RickyRelucent> goes well with the mist ring from cat covenant, turns you invisible
[3:41:31] <%CateHecate> DND magic item rules
[3:41:35] <RickyRelucent> there is also a invisibility spell
[3:41:37] <%Ensign_Epic> ah kk
[3:41:40] <%Lordgale119> DS2 restoring humanity gave you your full hp bar back, DS3 gives you a larger health bar
[3:41:40] <leomuratore> Pretty well versed mage
[3:41:41] <RickyRelucent> but those tend to not stack together
[3:41:41] <%Ensign_Epic> my b
[3:41:47] <%Lordgale119> but in DS1 the only benefit is online
[3:41:48] <%townzzzzz> INTO THE TAR PITS
[3:41:51] <RickyRelucent> cant run replenishment = power within
[3:41:53] <RickyRelucent> for example

[3:42:31] <%Ensign_Epic> you can stack a body buffer with a weapon buff though

[3:43:31] <%DextralMalin> got it, thanks
[3:43:34] <RickyRelucent> @octotasty it can be with priscilla's soul, dont need to upgrade the greatscythe
[3:43:36] <@Solidus_113> the only one that respawns is the Izalith bridge

[3:46:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> one Kappa
[3:46:29] <%vVAstrAVv> 2 giants ahead
[3:46:32] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:46:35] <%waltzqueen> Anothe One
[3:46:36] <BigYanno> did you see this one's HEALTH
[3:46:37] <%AbnormalVoid> these two are WAY stronger
[3:46:41] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus The two Reggie is fighting now are like twice as strong as the previous two.
[3:46:42] <BigYanno> These 2 are SO STRONG
[3:46:48] <tolloponik> Bustur!!!
[3:46:48] <stevenellis386> awwwww good attempt tho
[3:46:49] <brunoberserk> aaaaand ANOTHER ONE
[3:46:49] <Dio_TR> F
[3:46:51] <%waltzqueen> F
[3:46:53] <octotasty> well, having upgrade materials for Queelag's Furysword might be a good idea.
[3:46:54] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus Not only are there quite a few, but the ones on this side of the basement are stronger than the first two (and give more souls).
[3:46:54] <emptyantics> F
[3:46:58] <bruuzer12> bottom floor of the fun house
[3:47:02] <peachy996> "Snekman, you have ruined my life!"
[3:47:03] <urkleturtle> yeah this pit is almost mandatory if you wanna use a boss weapon
[3:47:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hey he got 2 that's pretty good
[3:47:09] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus For some ungodly reason those two in the side room have boosted stats.
[3:47:11] <+Sir_Louis> Non-sustainably farm
[3:47:15] <+Sir_Louis> like how you farm for oil
[3:47:17] <Lefteron> I dont thinh anyone respawns
[3:47:23] <BigYanno> "scythe" that is clearly a Bardiche
[3:47:30] <subjectg> those two have the same stats as the one in anor londo and izalith
[3:47:34] <MeImoth> btw those two to the side (under Logan) are notably stronger and more tanky then the ones in the main room
[3:47:35] <Mattmandx1> Actually a bardiche, not a scythe
[3:47:39] <RickyRelucent> base dmg is higher
[3:47:42] <%fat_burtreynolds> wait. There’s a titanite demon that responds????
[3:47:44] <RickyRelucent> great has scaling S
[3:47:45] <%Finnmac5> Thats a bardiche why is it a scythe
[3:47:51] <Johannen> Yeah, misnamed its a bardiche
[3:47:52] <Treasure_Vault> Sens is dense, take your time
[3:47:56] <subjectg> @fat_burtreynolds yep, the izalith demon respawns
[3:48:02] <%CaptainBeird> @woolieversus there's a hole right turn and right turn from bonfire that leads down to the tar pit fazter
[3:48:04] <BigYanno> anyone who grew up playing Diablo 2 knows a bardiche by sight
[3:48:08] <%CateHecate> SPEEEEN
[3:48:18] <+Titsmcgheeee> Spin to win is back baby
[3:48:22] <emptyantics> SPIN 2 WEEN
[3:48:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> IT'S BEYBLAAAAAAAAADE
[3:48:23] <justcallmebobplease> Is the Lost Izalith respawning Titanite Demon the strongest one?  Feels that way when fighting them.
[3:48:27] <%Finnmac5> Well, the bardiche is my favorite pole arm so next playthrough Im getting that I guess
[3:48:27] <RickyRelucent> Buy the steel set? pog
[3:48:43] <subjectg> The bardiche is great if you’re running dex and want a halberd to play with
[3:48:48] <%Ensign_Epic> @justcallmebobplease yup
[3:48:56] <Johannen> Yeah, there are a series of falls and pits
[3:48:59] <justcallmebobplease> @Ensign_Epic Of COURSE the only respawning one's the strongest.
[3:49:02] <Treasure_Vault> Do it anyway!
[3:49:03] <%fat_burtreynolds> Izalith demon is the one you gotta sprint by when your going back to blighttown
[3:49:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's fine chat
[3:49:20] <%theoldone001> You can see those Titanite demons from the room Logan was in
[3:49:21] <+KennyKRool> Do we know if tarkus?
[3:49:22] <%CaptainBeird> dammit >.< ok
[3:49:23] <Treasure_Vault> Begrudgingly lead him there. I think it's the hole at the end of a corridor by the bonfire?
[3:49:23] <%Rafraud> What's going on?
[3:49:25] <+Titsmcgheeee> yeah from lvl 2 spider covenant
[3:49:38] <shieldanvil> i can't believe i get back from work, and reggie's already mastered house of fun
[3:49:39] <youngking_kush> I think there's an item there too
[3:49:50] <%Ensign_Epic> @justcallmebobplease I farm the damn thing for its catchpole at SL 25 + 10. yeah he's a real sumbitch ain't he?
[3:50:02] <%AbnormalVoid> could also go back to Firelink and buy Fall Control
[3:50:05] <%Deekman> handled
[3:50:06] <JetpackMcQuack> bzzt
[3:50:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> bodied
[3:50:07] <+Jiggisnipe> situation handled

[3:50:09] <+gmunnny> LUL
[3:50:11] <%Rafraud> sippy
[3:50:14] <BigYanno> gotta learn to spam roll as you fall
[3:50:15] <Sunstalker> Plunge attack 1 for a start
[3:50:16] <Wyldesquirrel> Doesnt he have hush equipped?
[3:50:18] <ALT3R4T0R> Oof
[3:50:20] <subjectg> firing squad
[3:50:33] <%Ensign_Epic> memory serving the safe drop is over by the slumbering dragoncrest ring
[3:50:33] <%Rafraud> Chat are we just clearing area before fights?
[3:50:39] <+KennyKRool> dodge by using the R2 to Jump over the projectile 5Head
[3:50:39] <RickyRelucent> @AbnormalVoid that'd be the play, this is better tho
[3:50:44] <justcallmebobplease> @Ensign_Epic Probably the single enemy that makes me most tempted to cheese, rather than play fair.  Dunno about you, but Titanite's just keep catching me with one more or another when I get greedy.
[3:50:50] <Johannen> Not sure you can survive from these
[3:50:52] <Sunstalker> what no, stay out thisn hole
[3:50:54] <%fat_burtreynolds> Reggie never bought fall control?
[3:50:57] <Tumier> phew
[3:51:01] <%CaptainBeird> no from the bonfire staircase
[3:51:03] <%Dopamien> PogChamp
[3:51:04] <Treasure_Vault> I don't think this is right
[3:51:05] <+TheFrancix> wow lol
[3:51:11] <RickyRelucent> @fat_burtreynolds dont even think he went to the burg to free the sorcerer
[3:51:12] <%Ensign_Epic> @justcallmebobplease I literally did just wind-up resorting to lightning bolts on an avelyn XD
[3:51:17] <$eco419> Wrong spot?
[3:51:24] <+MooseIsGoose> This is not what they are talking about I think
[3:51:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:51:25] <freddyl0c0> nice shortcut
[3:51:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RickyRelucent he did
[3:51:29] <justcallmebobplease> @Ensign_Epic That's about right, heh.
[3:51:29] <subjectg> Great place to ambush people as an invader
[3:51:30] <JetpackMcQuack> advanced fortressing
[3:51:31] <RickyRelucent> oh cool fuck me then
[3:51:33] <Crowroost> daredevil
[3:51:33] <Treasure_Vault> woolie lead to the wrong spot? I think it's the hole in the corridor.
[3:51:33] <%Ensign_Epic> this was not the right spot at all
[3:51:36] <+セビー> @rickyrelucent he bought his sorcs from him
[3:51:37] <Treasure_Vault> Not sure.
[3:51:40] <+MooseIsGoose> mission accomplished
[3:51:43] <@Solidus_113> LIVIN
[3:51:49] <%Ensign_Epic> I'm pretty sure you're right treasure vault
[3:51:50] <%Fefe41> How the hell
[3:51:51] <youngking_kush> WE OUTSIDE
[3:51:51] <RickyRelucent> thought he might've bought the arrows off griggs
[3:51:52] <Sunstalker> the hole is down in the boulder corrider somewhere close to the top
[3:51:54] <LunarRemix> he's so lucky
[3:51:55] <RickyRelucent> my mistake
[3:51:56] <+foomaster22> got to the destination who cares about the journey
[3:51:58] <%Fefe41> Reggie is finding his own way down
[3:52:02] <+セビー> these beam jump feel like pvp pathing
[3:52:06] <emptyantics> SIGMA GRINDSET
[3:52:07] <%mikash91> Complete celular pogifaction
[3:52:10] <Sunstalker> You can leap across to the giant loading the boulders btw
[3:52:18] <Tempmael> the breakroom
[3:52:22] <oda_flobunaga> right up the elden ring
[3:52:25] <urkleturtle> he's fallen and he can't get up!
[3:52:28] <%fat_burtreynolds> Coming hot with 1 estus
[3:52:30] <SolidusA> st
[3:52:39] <+GerryOmega> snake bro was me rn hiding from work
[3:52:50] <youngking_kush> Magic?
[3:52:57] <%CateHecate> DEAD ANGLED
[3:52:57] <%Rafraud> So much damage
[3:52:57] <gryffinp> jump
[3:52:58] <%townzzzzz> 2 hits
[3:52:59] <ALT3R4T0R> Think that shortcut would be better used with a kindled bonfire, seems a bit too risky damage wise for just 5 estus
[3:53:02] <+MooseIsGoose> There really is not a need to fight them
[3:53:02] <Zantetzuken> deja vu
[3:53:02] <agustorm123> This guy is stronger?
[3:53:07] <BurdRightsActivist> Another one.
[3:53:11] <JetpackMcQuack> fuck that
[3:53:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> those 2 are way stronger
[3:53:15] <+セビー> give reggie the zaps
[3:53:17] <%waltzqueen> BACKSWING
[3:53:18] <%Fefe41> He likes jumping too much
[3:53:18] <+robertoszek> that damage is not looking good, it's gonna take forever
[3:53:18] <+Jiggisnipe> might as well tell him that these 2 are stronger
[3:53:25] <RyuuAoi> The greed
[3:53:29] <Treasure_Vault> Go right from bonfire exit, then right,
[3:53:34] <+cdrom321> These two are the stronger variant of the Titanite Demon.
[3:53:35] <%Lion_kun> Don't give up regg, you can do it.
[3:53:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> So then I started blastin woolieCHAN
[3:53:53] <+MooseIsGoose> yes through the all with the trap and to the right
[3:53:54] <knight_of_the_edge> hey is reggie whereing the rusted iron ring???
[3:53:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you somehow get a boss weapon you need 2 more titanite for it, then it's worth otherwise you're good
[3:53:58] <Treasure_Vault> the hole in the corridor? go an inch past where he asked that?
[3:53:59] <RyuuAoi> Reggie, it's only gonna get harder. You've gotta learn from it and get BIG.

[3:55:09] <Treasure_Vault> Check the hole two rights from the bonfire? if it's nothing it's nothing but it might be a thing
[3:55:19] <%Ensign_Epic> he is at WL+15 because he maxed his catchpole

[4:02:55] <gryffinp> he got et by the mimic, survived, and then went back a second time
[4:02:57] <%Deekman> @WoolieVersus might be a good idea to check on logan before beating the boss
[4:03:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> and it put the fear of chests in him

[4:09:49] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus What titanite demon did Reggie get the catch pole from?  Looks like he got it pretty early.
[4:09:50] <+delilah4you> oh he's so far ahead right now compared to the Anime
[4:09:52] <%MonsieurHonHon> ONCE TARKUS GOES ON SCREEN IM GIVING A SUB LES GO
[4:09:54] <+rumblarrock> am I too late for the tarkus hype
[4:09:54] <fantom_flasch> Tarkus fell off for me too
[4:09:57] <Johannen> @delilah4you He just got owned and killed not thrown off
[4:09:59] <subjectg> @thebuttravage darkroot
[4:10:00] <%Ensign_Epic> @thebuttravage literally the first one
[4:10:02] <+cdrom321> The great SBFP moment may never happen again. It didn't work for PeachSaliva. It didn't work for Plague recently.
[4:10:03] <BigYanno> the point of tarkus isn't to make things fair. It's cos Tarkus can SOLO THIS BITCH
[4:10:05] <dundore77> its not really a hard fight either way especially with a maxed out weapon
[4:10:11] <%MonsieurHonHon> @rumblarrock right on time friend
[4:10:12] <TheButtravage> @subjectg Wow, that's lucky lol
[4:10:28] <Treasure_Vault> @cdrom321 Woolie accidentally kited it perfectly his first try.
[4:10:43] <Grev_stalmon> Reggie may just get lucky enough to get the animation
[4:10:46] <%CateHecate> THE LEGEND
[4:10:47] <%waltzqueen> Antici-----pation
[4:10:52] <+Titsmcgheeee> whoa how did he pop 3?
[4:10:53] <Johannen> INT
[4:11:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cdrom321 im not expecting THAT level of tarkus, but I hope he still kicks his ass
[4:11:03] <Wyldesquirrel> I paused my porn to see the legend come back to life
[4:11:08] <+rumblarrock> aw yeah
[4:11:08] <OblivionSword1> LUL
[4:11:10] <TheHeroAppears> @Titsmcgheeee remastered
[4:11:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I summoned him like last night and we pwned golem real good
[4:11:11] <%RyTYoung> 1 humanity my good sir
[4:11:11] <%DextralMalin> aw man, I'm leaving work as soon as we see the thing.
[4:11:12] <%Josef_Stryker> I went to take a nap. Did Reggie not fight the boss yet?
[4:11:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Wyldesquirrel LUL
[4:11:16] <LunarRemix> Reggie should really invest in int
[4:11:17] <%Lion_kun> Will the legend return?
[4:11:19] <Johannen> Big swings with what? You aint even using str weapon)
[4:11:20] <dundore77> quick invade him
[4:11:20] <%DextralMalin> traveling for an hour
[4:11:20] <%MonsieurHonHon> LETS GO PogChamp
[4:11:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Josef_Stryker you're just in time
[4:11:24] <%Finnmac5> Is it Tarkus time? I think its Tarkus time

[4:11:33] <GrislyBoar> Looks like I came at the right time.
[4:11:39] <%Josef_Stryker> Now let's see how it plays out for Reggie
[4:11:39] <Sonicdy> LES GO
[4:11:43] <%CaptainBeird> now watch reggie walk off the cliff
[4:11:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> please don't fall
[4:11:46] <$eco419> T A R K U S
[4:11:47] <+cdrom321> @treasure_vault That seems to be the problem. You need to get them to fight in the wide area instead of the rear bridge.
[4:11:49] <%CateHecate> im hoping we get a Rules of Nature moment so bad
[4:11:52] <MinersLoveGames> LET THE LEGEND come back to life!
[4:11:58] <%CateHecate> NOW GO

[4:35:05] <AngryAsian5> Hope both of those Tarkus encounters were clipped
[4:35:07] <@Solidus_113> tough but mostly fair

[4:35:14] <Tracazoid> Reggie deep in
[4:35:14] <agustorm123> PEOPLE WHO DONT COMPLETE IT
[4:35:15] <RickyRelucent> this is where most ppl gave up
[4:35:21] <+Grayhammatter> tin tarkus
[4:35:24] <gryffinp> well... not the LITERAL bottom.
[4:35:24] <%specters_art88> Love the Reggie Reactions
[4:35:24] <fantom_flasch> Also literally, DS1's map might be more vertical than horizontal
[4:35:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> well...
[4:35:31] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM AND NOW WE FUCKIN HERE
[4:35:31] <RickyRelucent> 28% got to the next boss
[4:35:31] <+JohnRSoviet> Started at the bottom now we're HERE
[4:35:32] <Awesome_Leaf> ash lake tho
[4:35:34] <%BinaryFireball> started from the bottom and now youre here
[4:35:34] <Dabrikishaw> Hell yeah, I prefer happy Reggie to Hollow Reggie from last time
[4:35:35] <%hax_metatron> REGGIE PVP WILL MAKE YOU SPEND 1000 Hrs in this
[4:35:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ash Lake tho
[4:35:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> Information was hard back in the 360 era. So a lot of people stopped
[4:35:38] <peachy996> You've been getting all the good zones lately
[4:35:40] <RyuuAoi> Nothing can stop him, he all the way up!
[4:35:41] <+vaderxyz1970> THIS GAME IS 8 MILE
[4:35:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> And went as high up as you can go
[4:35:47] <+NiktenKing> Almost
[4:35:47] <AngryAsian5> NOW WE'RE HERE
[4:35:50] <DapperCadavr> it's REAL
[4:35:51] <Darthkitten_Prime> There's lower, but shh.
[4:35:54] <%RyTYoung> Anor Londo is the peak
[4:35:56] <%hax_metatron> @KeiganOfAstora Tomb of the Giants is the theoretical deepest point
[4:35:56] <emptyantics> Ash Lake and Painted world is also beautiful
[4:36:05] <subjectg> @glass_marcus knowing woolie’s own experience, he’ll save the painted world for after o&s
[4:36:05] <%BinaryFireball> I hope you're ready for a test though
[4:36:06] <+JohnRSoviet> Reggie has seen the mountain top
[4:36:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Izalith is seen in Giants to go down a bit more tho
[4:36:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's such a perfect description
[4:36:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus people quit because A) invaders B) they don't have a set as powerful as yours C) They didn't have a guide, like woolz. People would get stuck for DAYS in blighttown, tomb of giants, etc.
[4:36:20] <+Grayhammatter> gotta get ready for the next test though
[4:36:21] <%Ensign_Epic> I was sort of hoping you'd make it to the smash Brothers today but hey making into anal rodeo ain't half-bad
[4:36:22] <+canseesea> That feeling of seeing anor londo after blight/sens was genuinely the best feeling a game has ever provided me
[4:36:24] <emptyantics> Now the REAL DARK SOULS starts LUL
[4:36:32] <%MutedMimic> woolieGASM

[4:36:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ I forgot the emote was a thing lol
[4:37:03] <dundore77> or you dont read any of the lore and just play the game like i did the first game and it means nothing

[4:38:42] <subjectg> We need a bet for the archers
[4:38:44] <dundore77> the real dark souls starts here
[4:38:44] <fantom_flasch> Maybe 40%
[4:38:44] <+milhousego> How far did Reggie get?
[4:38:44] <%Ensign_Epic> absolutely he's got to get through the church rafters first, before the archers
[4:38:45] <RickyRelucent> matters on your point of view
[4:38:46] <fantom_flasch> lol
[4:38:46] <fmbboaventura> Can't wait for o&s
[4:38:47] <+Jiggisnipe> eh
[4:38:49] <+Grayhammatter> tutorial complete
[4:38:49] <BigYanno> he's already done a little bit of the second half tho
[4:38:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Slam Jam soon Kappa
[4:38:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Anor Londo is the Dark Souls of Dark Souls
[4:38:54] <+SnorlaxBud> Soon to hit the boss that makes 70% of players quit LUL
[4:38:54] <+Grayhammatter> archer time bois
[4:38:54] <olwe123> Praise that SUN
[4:38:56] <DianaTheAscian> I missed the whole stream where is Reggie at now?
[4:38:57] <%hax_metatron> Honestly the game is a victory lap after O&S IMO
[4:38:59] <OblivionSword1> the 2nd half pre dlc
[4:39:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @ReallyBigRocks accurate
[4:39:02] <%vVAstrAVv> NEXT STOP LOST IZALITH
[4:39:02] <agustorm123> PRAISE THE SUN
[4:39:11] <+Jiggisnipe> @DianaTheAscian just reached Anor Londo
[4:39:12] <%RyTYoung> Sen's is a nightmare on your first go around
[4:39:17] <theamazingaesoup> Just stepped foot in Anor Londo
[4:39:17] <+canseesea> Unfortunately he's run through most of the second best area of the actual second half. There's a lot of downhill after this
[4:39:18] <RickyRelucent> enbSun enbSun enbSun enbSun enbSun enbHangry enbHangry enbHangry enbHangry enbHangry
[4:39:20] <DianaTheAscian> @Jiggisnipe nice
[4:39:20] <%Fefe41> He destroyed Sens
[4:39:23] <EyeDiddleDogz> Woolie is the ultimate wingman; guiding newcomers to the city of the Gods
[4:39:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @hax_metatron idk about that
[4:39:30] <SainEdge> The first time, i didnt find the sens fortress bonfire and the cage shortcut, so I walked all the way back to Andre to level up affter the boss LUL
[4:39:31] <Valdorick> Next Stop is Biggie and Smalls, asking Reggie to come on and jam, and welcoming him to the slam.
[4:39:41] <dundore77> anor londo is a massive peak followed by a huge pit afterwards
[4:39:58] <fantom_flasch> snorlax and pikachu
[4:40:00] <ambig_anti> oroSleeper
[4:40:01] <agustorm123> Dunkstein and Slamough
[4:40:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Kappa
[4:40:08] <%hax_metatron> I disagree DS1 goes downhill after O&S.  I think it's meant to be a victory lap, they show you varied environments, and that's why Gwyn is a pushover too. You're the strongest Chosen Undead once you beat O&S
[4:40:28] <FrostedZaibatsu> It gets even better
[4:40:30] <+robertoszek> @hax_metatron including the dlc?
[4:40:40] <%hax_metatron> Yeah the Painted World is still a FANTASTIC level
[4:40:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:40:42] <%hax_metatron> The DLC is great
[4:40:43] <subjectg> a victory lap that saps all my motivation, maybe
[4:40:44] <fantom_flasch> DLC is def the exception
[4:40:49] <subjectg> but the dlc is good
[4:40:52] <%Fefe41> It's downhill because 3 of the 4 areas after O&S were rushed
[4:40:52] <jett_eyes> (Just do it, It'll open up the rest of the game)
[4:40:52] <agustorm123> HEY DJ TURN IT UP
[4:41:01] <DianaTheAscian> Naw they just ran out of time it ain't no victory lap
[4:41:09] <Allen_33> oh no
[4:41:11] <RickyRelucent> do the dlc somewhat appropriately, before gwyn
[4:41:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> pain is coming
[4:41:19] <EyeDiddleDogz> Good work Bois
[4:41:23] <RyuuAoi> Chill out, Chat. Reggie saying it now.
[4:41:27] <@Solidus_113> CLOWNS
[4:41:30] <royb2> AHHH I thought reggie didnt see the chat
[4:41:33] <ulcaban> missed the golem fight, did they do the thing?
[4:41:33] <%Majkir> woolieONEGUY
[4:41:36] <%theoldone001> I forgot, yeah the DLC is left too.
[4:41:39] <+canseesea> Yeah I thought Reggie actually couldn't see chat the whole time
[4:41:40] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  Reggie i would urge you to consider getting the Iron Golem Armor; it matches amazingly with the Boars Helm
[4:41:44] <%counterfeitgimmicks> I thought Reggie couldn't see chat :x
[4:41:46] <$AudacityESQ> Wait until Godzilla comes in WutFace
[4:41:49] <MeImoth> Oh... I was under the impression that only Woolie can see chat at all...

[4:41:56] <+kevlarkoala> dont think ANYONE knew reggie could see the chat
[4:41:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah I had thought only Woolie could see chat lol

[4:42:12] <glass_marcus> Same. I was under the assumption reggie was is a seperate world from the chat and woolie was the link between us
[4:42:12] <%Lion_kun> Probably moonlight
[4:42:16] <+pectusumbra> Chat, remember the lesson of an irrelevant youtuber: "SHUT. THE FUCK. UP"
[4:42:19] <+kevlarkoala> people been spoiling from day one lmao, everyone thought reggie couldn't see it
[4:42:20] <Treasure_Vault> I would have talked differently if I knew Reggie could see chat. Whoops.
[4:42:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol no
[4:42:25] <%Lion_kun> what sword is that?
[4:42:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah he's not using that with any int
[4:42:30] <subjectg> It doesn’t even have a cool moveset
[4:42:35] <bosssbatttle> @Lion_kun The wolfs sword
[4:42:36] <%hax_metatron> Same I would be quiet if I knew Reggie was watching
[4:42:36] <subjectg> unlike in the other games
[4:42:36] <$eco419> Yeyeyey
[4:42:38] <+MooseIsGoose> @cobalt_phoenix_ swaord of A
[4:42:40] <%Lion_kun> Ah that sword
[4:42:40] <Valdorick> @Lion_kun Sword of the Blood of the Echo of the Wolf
[4:42:44] <Johannen> Moonlight sword requires help to get that tail
[4:42:45] <urkleturtle> that sword is for ng+++ and beyond
[4:42:45] <FrostedZaibatsu> Just let Reggie play. y'know
[4:42:46] <fmbboaventura> How are the stats so far? It sucks this game doesn't have respec
[4:42:47] <%Fefe41> Reggie hates religion confirmed
[4:42:48] <%BinaryFireball> Ass Sword
[4:42:48] <%Lion_kun> Cool guy sword
[4:42:49] <DSD24> The Gura Sword
[4:42:53] <$eco419> Guts
[4:42:55] <OblivionSword1> ah I see
[4:42:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cobalt_phoenix_ oh I mean lol no they're not using that with those requirements
[4:42:56] <Dabrikishaw> Yeah, stick with STR and INT weapons Reggie
[4:42:59] <subjectg> MLGS is what you’re gonna be aiming for
[4:42:59] <%Ensign_Epic> did someone really just when ironically suggest arty's sword?
[4:43:02] <@Solidus_113> Reggie could technically build towards the Moon
[4:43:03] <OblivionSword1> yeah fair enough
[4:43:07] <%Ensign_Epic> *unironically
[4:43:15] <OblivionSword1> Moon could work
[4:43:17] <TheButtravage> @WoolieVersus The best faith weapons are honestly just the ones you infuse with divine, most faith scaling weapons are pretty doo doo in DS1.
[4:43:19] <jett_eyes> ah, they talking about the MGS
[4:43:21] <@Solidus_113> 28 int
[4:43:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[4:43:23] <%Lion_kun> You'd have to make a real pancake build to wield that weapon.

[4:43:37] <%Lion_kun> WHY DID YOU OPEN IT TWICE REGGIE HAHAHA
[4:43:39] <+pectusumbra> If reggie truly embraces main character status, MGS is going to be the end game
[4:43:42] <emptyantics> Moonlight Greatsword is so goddamn sexy shame it wasn’t in Sekiro
[4:43:43] <%Lordgale119> but he needs to ACQUIRE that weapon first

[4:44:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ah fuck there's absolutely "fanart" of mimics isn't there NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:44:09] <Wyldesquirrel> @WoolieVersus It is easier to conceptualize the everlasting dragons as Elementals who were 'neutral' to life pre-fire, forced into the alive/dead system by advent of fire. once alive they mutated
[4:44:10] <+cdrom321> "Was that a mimic? I better check again."
[4:44:11] <MeImoth> best faith weapon? anything +15 buffed with Sunlight Blade LUL

[4:45:28] <OblivionSword1> Woolie's Tarkus was super lucky
[4:45:29] <+Grayhammatter> tin tarkus was fun
[4:45:30] <jett_eyes> I originally did it without Takus ;-;
[4:45:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lion_kun it was a good bit
[4:45:41] <+KBGuilty> isn't tarkus from jojos?
[4:45:42] <%Ensign_Epic> Fake Tarkus should have come along for the ride with real Tarkus

[4:46:08] <%tank7013> I bet if they could have they would've given Tarkus a cannon arm
[4:46:11] <agustorm123> Giant dad is also a great build
[4:46:22] <+BignanasTheGawd> Yeye

[4:47:23] <@Solidus_113> tomb is a rough place
[4:47:27] <%Ensign_Epic> MLGS is a royal pain to get ye
[4:47:31] <%Lion_kun> Tomb is endgame\
[4:47:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Lion_kun man the first time i thought i wasn't doing enough damage or something, guess it's the very tippy tip tho
[4:47:44] <+Grayhammatter> tomb is rough
[4:47:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:47:48] <+robertoszek> and that bonfire was added on the remastered
[4:47:55] <Chatterbox1991> @jett_eyes it's difficult to assume DS1 would pull something like that
[4:47:56] <%Deekman> Wakka?! For real?
[4:47:59] <%DapperCadavr> DapperCadavr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Yo Woolie if you want more tasty Disco Elysium content. Check out the posters designed internall for Za/Um that expands lore on the Pale.
[4:48:04] <%Deekman> The dude from FFX?
[4:48:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> TARKUS
[4:48:06] <%Lion_kun> I managed to get it with a spellcaster build and I got super lucky with a crystal soul arrow.
[4:48:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> There is only one place worse to be than that one before O and S
[4:48:16] <%Ensign_Epic> Tomb's one of the most annoying areas to navigate. If it had normal light it would be super easy
[4:48:17] <%bruuzer12> The chant is worth the sub
[4:48:22] <DXLelouch24> Your friend Wakka?
[4:48:37] <RickyRelucent> steel armor looks better >:c
[4:49:06] <+MooseIsGoose> No Dark souls 3 had a good one in my opinion
[4:49:13] <%Lion_kun> I don't think Fromsoft ever gave such an amazing pay off in the other games.
[4:49:26] <+BignanasTheGawd> I hope Elden Ring has something similar
[4:49:26] <eldritchdieity> Hey Woolie i wanted to apologize for making that NFT
[4:49:31] <%Lion_kun> The closest was in DS3
[4:49:32] <%hax_metatron> Irithyll's view is great but the journey to it doesn't match the journey to Anor Londo in my opinion.
[4:49:33] <%Ensign_Epic> I sorta like the DS3 Anal Rodeo reveal
[4:49:34] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @mooseisgoose the end if DS3 was a great reveal
[4:49:39] <%Dopamien> that feeling is pretty subjective
[4:49:42] <%Deekman> I disagree, Bloodborne
[4:49:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's the worst in ds3 I think because almost every place looks like anor londo so it becomes much less special. Boreal valley is still cool though
[4:49:45] <%Lion_kun> Ringed City reveal maybe?
[4:49:46] <DianaTheAscian> 3 has one part in it
[4:49:46] <agustorm123> DS3
[4:49:53] <$Rumbutt> yep
[4:49:55] <%bruuzer12> Yeah, that one
[4:49:56] <royb2> yyep
[4:49:57] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[4:49:59] <Treasure_Vault> There might be one in this game too, down under.
[4:50:01] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[4:50:01] <OblivionSword1> oh yeah that
[4:50:03] <%Rafraud> Best game
[4:50:04] <%sewermonk> hell yeah
[4:50:10] <%RealThiele> bordt country is hot
[4:50:12] <RickyRelucent> From the amazing maps in DKS 1, burg blight town to forest and catacombs and anor londo
[4:50:14] <nxflre> Iirthyll
[4:50:15] <%hax_metatron> It's just Anor Londo again too LUL
[4:50:16] <%AmazingBlanket> ringed city reveal, or the view coming up from catacombs of carthus imo
[4:50:16] <knight_of_the_edge> @WoolieVersus are you going to go for the sword of moonlight????
[4:50:17] <RickyRelucent> to dks2
[4:50:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nothing cool back there Kappa
[4:50:21] <emptyantics> Irythill
[4:50:21] <OblivionSword1> yeah that one's pretty strong contender
[4:50:21] <%Dopamien> irithyll is pretty :)
[4:50:23] <%hax_metatron> Irithyll is JUST Anor Londo too
[4:50:24] <agustorm123> Bloodbourne tho
[4:50:25] <RickyRelucent> where everything is kinda shit, considering the map
[4:50:26] <%Lion_kun> Irthyll reveal was really good
[4:50:29] <Awesome_Leaf> man does tha ting
[4:50:29] <DianaTheAscian> well ds3 has 2 I would say
[4:50:30] <+pectusumbra> on that note, where do you plan to put bloodborne in the sequence?
[4:50:34] <lymund> the profane capital was my anor lando
[4:50:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Majula and the tower of flame come close
[4:50:37] <jett_eyes> Well it's kinda expected with Boreal, since it's literally underneath AL
[4:50:37] <subjectg> The view outside aldia’s is pretty nice
[4:50:42] <emptyantics> Bloodborne has some good ones
[4:50:43] <%KellBeII> ill get yay one of these streams reg
[4:50:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> I need to restart DS3. Went to the DLC early by accident. Underpowered and it ruined that game for me
[4:50:46] <%Lion_kun> I'm pretty sure they're going by chronological release.
[4:50:49] <%Ensign_Epic> oh wow I completely missed how castlesuperbeast has that area in it
[4:50:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man i'd KILL for a DS1 remaster by Blue Sky
[4:50:51] <subjectg> eleum loyce is a nice place as well
[4:51:00] <%Lion_kun> So Ds2 to BB to DS3 to Sekiro to Elden Ring
[4:51:02] <%A_German_spy> @WoolieVersus GG, guys!
