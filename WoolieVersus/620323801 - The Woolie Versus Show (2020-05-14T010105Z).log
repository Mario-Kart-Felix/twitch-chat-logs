[0:00:07] <%Bluemanzee> We back :)
[0:00:10] <%cisealnine> cisealnine subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! I did it.
[0:00:20] <+jaytitan96> jaytitan96 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:00:36] <teamzackattack> we not done
[0:00:43] <%DatAsuna> I picked the right name
[0:00:48] <%MrRabbles> yellow cards were the secret tech
[0:01:50] <Desertfishing> 17 split
[0:02:01] <%legacy0117> There we go. Back. ^^
[0:02:16] <Desertfishing> true
[0:02:40] <%DatAsuna> They al gt mad at you
[0:02:41] <%alpacasintophats> especially since you're more statistically likely to get a card that values a 10
[0:02:46] <reonome> big salt
[0:02:47] <%DatAsuna> Yeah those people suck
[0:02:50] <%RioGascar> I guess i play a little too safe
[0:02:53] <reonome> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[0:02:57] <Desertfishing> that's when you laugh at them
[0:03:01] <%alpacasintophats> since there are 16 cards that are 10s out of a 52 card deck
[0:03:10] <reonome> high risk high reward baby
[0:03:15] <%RioGascar> but i also do not play like casino blackjack
[0:03:22] <%Irridium> is that the blackjack version of playing on WiFi?
[0:03:23] <KnivesEve> reply with hoes mad
[0:03:25] <%RioGascar> i’ve never gotten to
[0:03:27] <infinite_rotation> busting Kreygasm
[0:03:31] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh wow that's a good point. I will never play blackjack with more than me and the dealer again
[0:03:33] <%legacy0117> Because people blame other before themselves these days.
[0:03:35] <Desertfishing> it's call gambling for a reason LUL
[0:03:40] <%legacy0117> others*
[0:04:22] <cipher758> audio demons defeated
[0:04:33] <%legacy0117> Can't say, "I gambled, a did not beat the percentage chances I had to win."
[0:04:40] <%RioGascar> If i did go to vegas i would probably play poker than blackjack
[0:04:40] <%legacy0117> and*
[0:04:45] <%alpacasintophats> light saber still out
[0:05:32] <%RioGascar> This guy acts weird
[0:05:41] <vaderxyz1970> Is this CIRYL from Archer
[0:05:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:43] <arkv01> freedom to do... what?
[0:05:50] <thesickestzak> This guy pays for feet pics
[0:05:55] <cipher758> weird dialogue delivery
[0:05:57] <%legacy0117> This guy is a plastic man.
[0:06:05] <thesickestzak> You can hear it in his voice
[0:06:17] <%RioGascar> What a fool
[0:06:20] <%RioGascar> Paying for porn
[0:06:30] <thesickestzak> A big huge dummy
[0:06:47] <%Gruhunchously> Oh there's going to be a lot of that, to be sure
[0:07:06] <NeakGX> just a little crime, as a treat
[0:07:23] <thesickestzak> Pls just 9% more crime
[0:07:43] <%legacy0117> I a have opinions, but they pay me enough not to do anything about it.
[0:07:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Is this guy looking for a promotion?
[0:08:10] <%RioGascar> He wants a promotion but he doesnt want to put the work in
[0:08:32] <arkv01> the capn knows
[0:08:47] <%Jetzord> "Look man, all I'm saying is that it would be real tragic if the Captain got shivved"
[0:08:48] <%Gruhunchously> A BAD feeling, would you say?
[0:09:02] <DSD24> Its always with the Naruto
[0:09:33] <Sedrelic> dont get attached, you will never meet them again
[0:09:36] <jorniev> that is just videogames woolie
[0:09:40] <%RioGascar> Well yeah cause naruto is hero guy who just wants to solve problems and help people
[0:09:54] <%RioGascar> a real person would probably feel bad but not be able to help
[0:10:16] <%GrassCannon> Whenever I introduce a new location in a D&D session, they first thing my players usually see is the bad guys.
[0:10:29] <%RioGascar> like hey welcome to Mexico...solve the drug cartel problem for us please???
[0:10:34] <infinite_rotation> I'm doing the quest to get shit not because I care
[0:10:51] <jorniev> @grasscannon how does that work?
[0:11:08] <%Gruhunchously> You radiate blue aura
[0:11:13] <%GrassCannon> First town they come to, there were a couple of thugs at the gate trying to shake them down
[0:11:26] <%GrassCannon> second town was under attack by soldiers sent by a rival lord
[0:11:29] <%GrassCannon> stuff like that
[0:11:32] <%legacy0117> So, can you turn this little idiot in?
[0:12:09] <Doodle_Taco> Had to leave, did I miss something important?
[0:12:22] <%RioGascar> That is one annoying thing with games
[0:12:41] <%RioGascar> like most times people in the world can not do shit themselves
[0:12:41] <jorniev> @grasscannon show the problem first so the players choose to get involved?
[0:12:49] <%GrassCannon> Exactly
[0:12:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:12:51] <%RioGascar> And rely on the player to fix their problems
[0:13:05] <jorniev> gonna remember that
[0:13:09] <Graxe_> Jedees
[0:13:20] <Redblood801> JEEDAI
[0:13:29] <%ChoculaUltra> gee die.
[0:13:52] <%alpacasintophats> The time of the SITH is NOW
[0:14:22] <tuesti> what order is woolie doing the planets?
[0:14:36] <%alpacasintophats> well with 1 left
[0:14:43] <%alpacasintophats> I presume Korriban to be next
[0:14:44] <%GrassCannon> Nar Shaddaa > Onderon > Dantooine > Korriban
[0:15:01] <%alpacasintophats> unless he has to go back to telos or onderon before that
[0:15:02] <tuesti> oh wow
[0:15:12] <zocano> not upgradable
[0:15:21] <+SolidusRex> Narshadman>This is the Way>Wisconsin>Moriband
[0:15:22] <%jaytitan96> Yes Korriban will totally be out final planet *sweating intensifies*
[0:15:23] <%Gruhunchously> Trandoshan
[0:15:32] <%GrassCannon> shh
[0:15:38] <%legacy0117> Lizard guys have to fight Wookies. Big ripper swords needed.
[0:15:43] <zocano> trandoshans are those lizard fucks
[0:16:14] <infinite_rotation> I only know trandoshans from galactic comando
[0:16:40] <infinite_rotation> even though its probobly not cannon they have fuckin shotguns in that
[0:16:42] <%Gruhunchously> Republic Commando?
[0:16:52] <infinite_rotation> republic commando sorry
[0:17:04] <%Gruhunchously> We already saw a bunch of Trandoshans on Nar Shaddaa
[0:17:05] <%legacy0117> Heavy Trandosian ripper swords are heavy though.
[0:17:06] <%DatAsuna> RC was legends but shotguns exist in both timelines
[0:17:21] <%Gruhunchously> It's like a normal pistol, but *evil*
[0:17:26] <%legacy0117> That spelling is correct, not mine.
[0:17:26] <lotharrio> A flat defense bonus is good.
[0:17:46] <%legacy0117> I think.
[0:18:18] <infinite_rotation> oh I've been out of the loop for a bit.i have to catch up. I'm only really watching now because Its like the first time I've caught a stream @gruhunchously
[0:18:26] <%Gruhunchously> Gotcha
[0:18:29] <lotharrio> Oh right, he sold super heavy armor.
[0:18:36] <%DatAsuna> @infinite_rotation congrats~
[0:18:38] <%Gruhunchously> Oh yeah, that lady
[0:18:52] <%DatAsuna> romeo and juliet
[0:19:00] <%alpacasintophats> pretty sure you ended up killing all of them
[0:19:03] <%legacy0117> Yeah Super Heavy armor is nice. But reduces your dodge abilities.
[0:19:04] <%jaytitan96> ALL THE PACKS
[0:19:10] <gruulmagebeast> best voice
[0:19:10] <%Gruhunchously> Shen! Rahasia! Mr Matale!
[0:19:21] <%jaytitan96> This dudes seen some shit
[0:19:25] <%Gruhunchously> You chewing rocks over there
[0:19:26] <lotharrio> This guy is like that mall detective from the Simpsons Christmas episode.
[0:19:29] <SixthSun2> This guy smokes gravel sticks, more like it
[0:19:37] <%GrassCannon> You don't want any more deathsticks.
[0:19:38] <%legacy0117> He is. x3
[0:19:39] <%Chatterbox1991> Admiral Hackett
[0:20:01] <Hammatime8> Audible lung cancer
[0:20:01] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:20:24] <%Gruhunchously> It's not actually Hackett
[0:20:30] <alrobot2014> general shepard
[0:20:34] <%Chatterbox1991> Michael Madson Throat
[0:20:39] <%DatAsuna> Commander
[0:20:39] <gruulmagebeast> wouldnt be a problem if you smashed their eggs
[0:20:48] <ht109> isn't hacket Lance Henriksen?
[0:20:49] <infinite_rotation> commander
[0:20:53] <%Gruhunchously> This guy ain't Lance Henrikson
[0:20:58] <personaplatinum> Little V dropping facts
[0:21:06] <%subjectg> lance henrikson soundalike is zherron i think
[0:21:54] <%JohnAtDawn> Yes
[0:21:55] <gruulmagebeast> this guys legit
[0:22:01] <%jaytitan96> He looked at your charecter sheet and wiped his ass with it
[0:22:22] <cipher758> this had to deal with a lot of main characters before
[0:22:34] <%legacy0117> Brb folks.
[0:22:46] <%Gruhunchously> This is a man who has had to deal with a lot of main characters
[0:23:16] <cipher758> yep
[0:23:37] <Desertfishing> I was never here *waves hand*
[0:23:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jaytitan96 Sometimes you gotta build a character with +38 Diplomacy and +60 Intimidate, so that you can tell NPC's "NO BUT BIG NUMBER THO"
[0:23:47] <Hammatime8> Yee haw.
[0:24:05] <%Gruhunchously> Obsidian cannot get away from the Cowboy motif
[0:24:16] <+thatotherblackkid> Would you have some GOD DAMN FAITH in the Force Arthur!?
[0:24:31] <%JohnAtDawn> And then they cut their own leg off by accident
[0:24:46] <tuesti> oh man, i just remembered about that restored content... in the enclave...
[0:24:53] <Desertfishing> fancy butter knife
[0:24:57] <Dangerzone979> It's about the FORCE Arthur, the FORCE!
[0:25:04] <%tearknack> the thing about lightsabers is that its absurdly dangerous, so the force REALLY helps
[0:25:11] <%GrassCannon> There's a character that's isn't force-sensitive that can use four!
[0:25:23] <jorniev> buy it of ebay
[0:25:25] <Desertfishing> hello there!
[0:25:33] <%jaytitan96> @GeneralSCPatton And sometimes you gotta go Full Punch Man and lay down the law
[0:25:33] <%Gruhunchously> You can't do it in this game though, because of D&D rules
[0:25:38] <Nat20_Gaming> Darth Malik tried to put Ol' Revan through hard times daddy. Hard times are when you work for 30 years building the Death Star and they give you a watch and kick you in the butt. Sorry your job was given to a droid daddy.
[0:25:54] <Jaku2011> Finn Should have been the main character
[0:25:57] <+Zouledge> I kinda like the thin lightsabers
[0:25:58] <+NWannabe> Tr-8R > untrained Finn tho
[0:25:58] <%DatAsuna> but not against tr8r
[0:26:08] <+Zouledge> @jaku2011 doodBro doodRage
[0:26:18] <%Jetzord> Can't believe he wanted his last words to be "I'm force Sensitive"
[0:26:26] <%Gruhunchously> A sword that has now counter-weight against the hilt, thouhg
[0:26:30] <gruulmagebeast> TR-8R
[0:26:42] <+NWannabe> F
[0:26:56] <%tearknack> tr-8r was SOOO HYPE
[0:27:01] <Jaku2011> TR8R was so dope
[0:27:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[0:27:05] <%cylish> Its wierd to me that everyone seems to forget that Kylo was bleeding out from a ruptured gut at the time of that fight
[0:27:10] <%DatAsuna> tr8r is the marauder shields of tfa
[0:27:10] <%JohnAtDawn> That's the power of a cool weapon design
[0:27:18] <%Gruhunchously> They wanted Phasma to be a breakout hit
[0:27:25] <SixthSun2> He?
[0:27:28] <neilgilbertg97> Boba fett anyone?
[0:27:33] <+oda_flobunaga> TK-421
[0:27:36] <%Chatterbox1991> that guy with the yellow face paint in Phantom Menace
[0:27:38] <%jaytitan96> Cool weapons that can counter lightsabers are always hype\
[0:27:38] <+NWannabe> twirling a weapon gives so much cred
[0:27:45] <+oda_flobunaga> JB-007
[0:27:48] <+NWannabe> haha you can't "FORCE" it
[0:27:54] <%tearknack> literally who?
[0:28:00] <%Chatterbox1991> Zora Bliss
[0:28:00] <%Jetzord> Poe's forced romance? That girl?
[0:28:03] <%jaytitan96> Lightsabers are cool but Tech that beats lightsaber IS COOLER
[0:28:06] <%Gruhunchously> Literally base an entire culure around the fact he has a cool helmet
[0:28:08] <%Bluemanzee> Phasma was also just a shiny sotrmtrooper. An already established thing. Fett was a whole new thing and spawned the Mandos
[0:28:09] <%tearknack> i haven't seen episode 9
[0:28:12] <%tearknack> i could smell the bad
[0:28:13] <RantingRavager> You can't.... FORCE it?
[0:28:24] <%tearknack> i didn't even HEAR that Poe ahd a romacne lol
[0:28:27] <jorniev> eeeeeeyyyyy
[0:28:35] <+NWannabe> i havent seen 8 or 9 cuz i really wanted Finn to get saber training
[0:28:35] <%tearknack> or if i did, i've forgoten that i did hear about it
[0:28:37] <%Gruhunchously> Literally twelve people
[0:28:53] <Dangerzone979> It's hard to even call it a romance
[0:29:03] <%Jetzord> @tearknack It was more implied than anything, not much came out of it except a plot device
[0:29:09] <gruulmagebeast> finn was kinda interesting and then they pushed rey who is so boring
[0:29:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Jorus Ca'Baoth?
[0:29:25] <%tearknack> YOOO
[0:29:31] <%Chatterbox1991> oh wait from the Movie?
[0:29:32] <%tearknack> i did not notice
[0:29:40] <%DatAsuna> 03-05 is the golden years
[0:29:41] <%tearknack> and i've played this game at least five times
[0:29:44] <+oda_flobunaga> cool
[0:30:03] <Jaku2011> My favorite part of the entire new trilogy is the first 20 or so minutes of Force Awakens which funny enough is when Finn was the main focus

[0:37:16] <alrobot2014> is this a way to hide shitty helmets?
[0:37:18] <silver__viii> Since Mandalore doesn't wear helmets technically the game maybe thought you were Mando and removed it?

[1:10:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Go full dark
[1:10:54] <ashenjuan25> Light never
[1:11:08] <TDAWS_MP132> isn't it goto influence up?
[1:11:14] <yeildingthought> Light never LUL
[1:11:19] <%alpacasintophats> there are more quests though before things though
[1:11:31] <+oda_flobunaga> You have more lightsabers than party members at this point... soooooooooooo
[1:11:38] <zocano> You can get lightside in the ruins?
[1:11:44] <+Kirbachev> Right, so extremely late now, but here's that old message that moobot hit me for, split into two.
[1:11:48] <DXLelouch24> no dual wielding cause lightside? see this is why Darksides better
[1:11:49] <lotharrio> Following through on the main questline should let you jump back up.
[1:11:54] <%Gruhunchously> Just go back to him, reveal what's inside them and take the original amount
[1:11:57] <%DatAsuna> big swinging pouch bulge
[1:12:01] <ashenjuan25> Light now ig
[1:12:02] <%DatAsuna> Make a choice
[1:12:03] <+Kirbachev> In a meta way, the focus on Revan's usage of psychological warfare and manipulation figures into the game mechanics here, as well. Kreia talks about how looking at him was like looking right into the heart of a star, he was so powerful.
[1:12:03] <lotharrio> I say get the money.
[1:12:06] <Augus7717> LUL
[1:12:08] <+Zanco23> The council was right, you can't choose which side you're on. Once you go dark, you don't go back.

[1:12:09] <gruulmagebeast> LIGHT NOW
[1:12:12] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[1:12:16] <lotharrio> It aint even a dark side push.
[1:12:18] <+Kirbachev> He was so powerful partly because he also worked on his personal non-force skills, which kept him grounded. Guess what skill any player of a game like this dumps their points into? Persuasion.
[1:12:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Get those John Williams Johns

[1:13:59] <BlueLunecy> GO-TO the Goat-To
[1:14:00] <Desertfishing> capitalism
[1:14:02] <%Gruhunchously> You ain't so bad, Go-To
[1:14:02] <+NWannabe> Goto shakedown
[1:14:03] <damienlunas> I think Woolie might actually not be able to turn Mira to a Jedi. Most of Mira's influence points seem to be on Onderon, and there's only one on Dantooine when you talk to one of the merchants.
[1:14:05] <%WanderingSwordsman> Stonks goes up
[1:14:05] <%Chatterbox1991> GO TO get the money
[1:14:07] <prince_johnny_> Goatto
[1:14:10] <arkv01> G0T PAID
[1:14:11] <Halospaz117> Go To the bank
[1:14:11] <%Jetzord> GOTO reached into his pocket and found another pocket
[1:14:11] <%alpacasintophats> G0-T0 says CAPITALISM IS KING
[1:14:11] <%Fujiwara_92> Mr G0-T0 shakedown
[1:14:12] <+Zanco23> Don't judge a book by it's cover
[1:14:17] <ashenjuan25> Who cares about Mira
[1:14:21] <%GrassCannon> G0-T0 looking out for the Pakk!
[1:14:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @DXLelouch24
[1:14:26] <%subjectg> @woolieversus You wanna see another good G0-T0 interaction? Bring him into the enclave later
[1:14:28] <%DatAsuna> It's fine to not jedi everyone.
[1:14:29] <%krispen_wa> i thought you could turn mira into a jedi from your starting convo if you picked the right choices
[1:14:31] <+AjaxFoamingCleanser> Influence Gained: Fann Y'Pakk
[1:14:31] <damienlunas> Mira's function is really strong though
[1:14:36] <%Chatterbox1991> yes
[1:14:42] <%DatAsuna> you can still see her story without training her
[1:14:43] <DXLelouch24> Friendship Ended with T3, Now Goto is my bestfriend
[1:14:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Are we sure Goto isn't related to Pockets in any way
[1:14:44] <+oldneckbeard> play how you want
[1:14:48] <silver__viii> @damienlunas the answer to that'll be a resounding "fuck Mira" so I don't think it'll be happening
[1:14:50] <CrypticMochi> GO-TO is hooked up to your fanny
[1:14:51] <damienlunas> But I think Woolie might have already messed up the initial conversation
[1:14:53] <ashenjuan25> Mira < Ju’hawny
[1:14:55] <jorniev> GOTO GET the cash got to get the dough
[1:14:56] <superinuit> PROTECT YA PAK
[1:15:07] <%krispen_wa> @damienlunas then fuck Mira
[1:15:11] <MasterDecoder> @ashenjuan25 Opinion
[1:15:12] <%Chatterbox1991> also for completions sake seeing Miras story through seems appropriate
[1:15:15] <%alpacasintophats> there's a chick you can sell them to probably
[1:15:16] <%DatAsuna> Juhani? More like Juhorny
[1:15:18] <%Fujiwara_92> G0-T0 says trans rights
[1:15:18] <+oda_flobunaga> this deal is getting better all the time!
[1:15:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> All your meatbags wallets look the same for me
[1:15:26] <Th3rd3> join the Dark Side, we got cookies and beer
[1:15:44] <Joestar1890> John's watching you guys...
[1:15:44] <ashenjuan25> Ju’hawny < trash
[1:15:44] <Manly_Rose> No you won't
[1:15:45] <lotharrio> Aww
[1:15:49] <%MrRabbles> we done
[1:15:57] <prince_johnny_> nooo
[1:16:07] <Redblood801> Game over, no...
[1:16:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Th3rd3 oatmeal cookies and light beer vs Cake and wiskey in like 2 hours with the light side
[1:16:19] <+oda_flobunaga> 410 billion hours left
[1:16:27] <ashenjuan25> Ahsoka ain’t much better tbh
[1:16:29] <lotharrio> If you handle like... five things right, you'll be fine.
[1:16:35] <gruulmagebeast> light later
[1:16:39] <+SolidusRex> Isn't it max light side?
[1:16:45] <Desertfishing> help a few old ladies cross the road
[1:16:48] <ashenjuan25> Hoes rich
[1:16:58] <%krispen_wa> Alignment Checks in this game are FUCKING STUPID
[1:17:09] <Redblood801> I mean... we can always cheat
[1:17:11] <Th3rd3> @doc_ock_rokc welp, Light Side it is then TehePelo
[1:17:13] <Redblood801> Just saying
[1:17:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:17:13] <+oda_flobunaga> Exar Tan
[1:17:24] <%Chatterbox1991> Exar Chan
[1:17:26] <+SolidusRex> Exar Senpai
[1:17:26] <lotharrio> Cheating can do it, yeah.
[1:17:44] <ashenjuan25> Chest now, cheat later
[1:17:45] <Manly_Rose> Nah alignment checks are great because they ask the player to commit.
[1:17:45] <silver__viii> it's a bit video games, yeah
[1:17:57] <Redblood801> Now I'm not saying we should cheat, but the option is on the table
[1:18:03] <damienlunas> So does Light Side literally not care about saving lives, it only cares about your motivations for doing so?
[1:18:06] <%derap41> like in Fable where murdering the homeless is less evil than divorcing your wife
[1:18:09] <Joestar1890> @Manly_Rose Especially when the game tells you WHY you should commit
[1:18:14] <+oldneckbeard> when in doubt, save scum
[1:18:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Stab em both!
[1:18:34] <DSD24> @derap41 Fable is pretty black and white
[1:18:37] <cipher758> "ur dumb." turns into sith lord
[1:18:55] <%Gruhunchously> Do the big goods so you can do the hting later
[1:18:55] <%derap41> @DSD24 Not about it being black and white but the balance of it in insane
[1:18:57] <+NWannabe> deuces, my sith
[1:18:57] <%krispen_wa> I REFUSE to understand
[1:19:00] <+Buzzkill983> Good Stream!
[1:19:05] <%tearknack> thanks for the stream doods
[1:19:06] <+NWannabe> Go do some real lifing
[1:19:06] <%Fujiwara_92> awwwww Kappa
[1:19:08] <Redblood801> 7 hours? Those are rookie numbers
[1:19:11] <Joestar1890> Ah, I'm in a different timezone
[1:19:13] <%GrassCannon> same
[1:19:18] <%alpacasintophats> "ur smart" turns right back into a jedi
[1:19:21] <SiegeJay> game over?
[1:19:22] <Badgerconda_> I feel that, man.
[1:19:22] <+Loinclothiclese> i need one real bad too
[1:19:24] <steelstwitchaccount> Eat your hair.
[1:19:26] <Redblood801> Just lop it off

[1:19:28] <%RC_S3kshun8> is that jesus?

[1:19:41] <arkv01> scissor it up V
[1:19:47] <DSD24> @derap41 I've been replaying it recently and its a weird balance
[1:19:48] <gruulmagebeast> ah yes this is big bun time
[1:19:48] <%ECRead> I feel
[1:19:50] <Das_Wood> woolie's haircut looking nice
[1:19:50] <arkv01> become the professional
[1:19:51] <tnamelessking> lilv kinda cute
[1:19:52] <+vaporousTippler> V refuses to scissor with Woolie.
[1:19:53] <Redblood801> Little V confirmed coward
[1:19:54] <%legacy0117> It's fine. x3 Lord Pazaak Delayed you a bit we understand.
[1:19:54] <Manly_Rose> V get dreads too
[1:19:55] <+NWannabe> put the bun up further so you hafta kinda balance it
[1:19:56] <%GrassCannon> artistic license
[1:20:00] <%DatAsuna> imagine bald V
[1:20:07] <arkv01> just do a light trim
[1:20:08] <Das_Wood> woolie truly looks like trunks now
[1:20:10] <%DatAsuna> bald AND clean shaven
[1:20:14] <%ECRead> yeeeeeeah
[1:20:14] <Th3rd3> do a ponytail V TPFufun
[1:20:15] <+BlockingDisabled> Imagine V with the 'Karen' cut
[1:20:16] <%alpacasintophats> that hair is really easily gonna get into the guitar strap
[1:20:18] <Augus7717> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[1:20:20] <%alpacasintophats> ouch man
[1:20:20] <%HostilePoundcakes> WutFace
[1:20:20] <%RC_S3kshun8> V check out Johnny Slicks - My hair is curly and thick and in that awkward stage - their Clay pomade works wonders for me
[1:20:27] <Redblood801> That sounds like it's happened before
[1:20:29] <+oda_flobunaga> Air Guitar fixes that problem
[1:20:32] <OverlordLuna> NotLikeThis
[1:20:32] <%derap41> Learn to Weave it and have that Nordic braid
[1:20:37] <%Jetzord> @DatAsuna I mean, as long as he has the sunglasses it'll look fine
[1:20:41] <+QuasartheHero> Hey V, where did you get your custom sabers from?
[1:21:06] <ashenjuan25> V with them hair whips
[1:21:10] <Das_Wood> gotta hit those youtube hair tutorials
[1:21:17] <+QuasartheHero> Thanks fam
[1:21:33] <T_Sasquatch> ? Is sabertrio good
[1:21:37] <%derap41> Their is a rat tail
[1:21:41] <Badgerconda_> Shouldn't Woolie have the padawan braid?
[1:21:54] <TigerClaws12> OOPS
[1:22:01] <+oda_flobunaga> 410 billion younglings killed
[1:22:01] <%RC_S3kshun8> Where can we follow V? @WoolieVersus
[1:22:05] <Desertfishing> light saber shears
[1:22:09] <+ChrisAlgoo> made an oopsie woopsie
[1:22:12] <%alpacasintophats> pray that the force warns you of the imminent fuck up
[1:22:33] <+Zanco23> Cool guy... just like Obito
[1:22:54] <%Chatterbox1991> YOOOOOOO V WAS BORN IN 91
[1:22:59] <+oda_flobunaga> 91 in the house!
[1:22:59] <%Chatterbox1991> BROOOOOOO
[1:23:02] <%DatAsuna> oof
[1:23:05] <Augus7717> oof
[1:23:05] <Scapeside> Same
[1:23:08] <%wunp_fxs> oof
[1:23:08] <OverlordLuna> OOF
[1:23:10] <%Fujiwara_92> oof
[1:23:12] <%0ctaeder> 92 here
[1:23:17] <%Fujiwara_92> play 12 V
[1:23:18] <%Chatterbox1991> o.o you are way more successful than i
[1:23:19] <%alpacasintophats> alright that's a way to do it
[1:23:19] <%ChoculaUltra> holy shit, power to you for starting with 13 and actually wanting to play other titles in the series.
[1:23:19] <+oda_flobunaga> I did 10-2 first.... big oof
[1:23:23] <Zayasu> i started with 12 LUL
[1:23:35] <ashenjuan25> Some padawan deaths have to had happen because of the hair memorial
[1:23:39] <%Fujiwara_92> I'm playing 12 right now
[1:23:50] <%DatAsuna> Partly true, but also the context in which it was released
[1:23:52] <+oda_flobunaga> 12 is J CRPG
[1:23:57] <+ChrisAlgoo> There's no way Clone Wars could be as expressive as the Genndy Wars unless it was done by Arc System Works
[1:24:00] <ashenjuan25> Same
[1:24:02] <+CptnCampy61> Nothin beats Genndy Wars
[1:24:06] <%alpacasintophats> try doing KH series, followed by ff5, 13-3, 13-2, 10, 6, 7, and then crisis core
[1:24:08] <%legacy0117> Thank you for playing guys. It's always a refreshing stream to watch, vs the endlessly deep salt mines of DK.
[1:24:08] <%DatAsuna> It's an unforced error they walked into
[1:24:09] <%ChoculaUltra> I've met a lot of younger dudes who started with 13, never finished it, and never picked up another FF because they bounced so hard off of it
[1:24:14] <%Chatterbox1991> @chrisalgoo or Platinum
[1:24:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:24:28] <ashenjuan25> I remember gendy wars came in a lightsaber you building pack and I was hooked on it
[1:24:30] <%alpacasintophats> how's that for fucky
[1:24:37] <%krispen_wa> The Mediocre Worlds
[1:24:38] <+oda_flobunaga> 13-2 actually is really good. the ending is great
[1:24:39] <+ChrisAlgoo> The secret best FF game is Tactics
[1:24:40] <%DatAsuna> ALSO SHOUT OUT TO THE CLONE WARS GAME BY PANDEMIC RIP THEIR SEO FOR CHOOSING A BAD NAme
[1:24:57] <%Fujiwara_92> Outer Worlds is ok... An solid AA
[1:25:01] <%DatAsuna> Both shows annihilated their google search results
[1:25:03] <infinite_rotation> what do you think about the idea of jedi showing more there knight moniker? heavy armor and such
[1:25:09] <%wunp_fxs> solid AA
[1:25:09] <zocano> 4 was my first FF and Tactics is the only one I actually like
[1:25:11] <%ChoculaUltra> still don't understand how Square can port almost every PS1 Final Fantasy over to Steam but NOT Tactics.
[1:25:11] <+oda_flobunaga> New Vegas is better than Outer Worlds period
[1:25:19] <ashenjuan25> Arc troops is the perfect example of gendy influence
[1:25:21] <%DatAsuna> yeah
[1:25:22] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, ppl was comparing it to fallout when it isn't
[1:25:31] <+Zanco23> I only finished the game in like 7 hours, so I didn't have enough time to lose interest and drop, but I probably would have.
[1:25:35] <Manly_Rose> Obsidians problems is that their last two game are more proofs of concept then full games
[1:25:35] <%DatAsuna> I hate that outer worlds deliberately recreates some of the jank
[1:25:38] <%krispen_wa> It's not just comparing it to its contemporaries, it's also incredibly bad compared to the Obsidian titles that came before
[1:25:39] <+CptnCampy61> @ashenjuan25 100% true
[1:25:41] <SiegeJay> Outer Worlds is bad
[1:25:42] <aubrea> like elden ring is going to get
[1:25:57] <%DatAsuna> like the uncomfortably close zoomed in convo camera
[1:26:02] <+oda_flobunaga> If Elden Ring is good in and of itself it will not matter
[1:26:03] <Jaku2011> I wasn't thinking about New Vegas when I played it its just ok
[1:26:03] <SiegeJay> Outer Worlds needs your companions to tell you, This is bad/
[1:26:07] <+oda_flobunaga> Sekiro was good
[1:26:10] <Manly_Rose> I say that as someone who loves Tyrany and likes Outer Worlds
[1:26:12] <ashenjuan25> Outer Worlds: Both Siding Every Conflict
[1:26:19] <%Fujiwara_92> ppl where waiting for a AAA game when realistically it could only be a AA
[1:26:27] <%DatAsuna> Big slavery bois
[1:26:29] <%Fujiwara_92> *were
[1:26:31] <%wunp_fxs> I thought theyre first was in baldurs gate....
[1:26:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Business partner"
[1:26:35] <Halospaz117> Nah I think there were hints
[1:26:39] <+prime_name> Woolie loves the bury your gays tropes
[1:26:47] <%DatAsuna> Leaves for horny crimes
[1:26:52] <+evbites> outerworlds was good just needed more content
[1:26:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Business Partners"
[1:26:58] <%Chatterbox1991> woolie is at war at the very concept of shipping
[1:26:59] <%DatAsuna> P. much
[1:27:00] <xenothemad> Did this vanish from the youtubes?
[1:27:01] <+QuasartheHero> Ok, v said vader valt and what else?
[1:27:02] <%DatAsuna> Just sell her
[1:27:06] <steelstwitchaccount> #juhaniSUX
[1:27:06] <%Irridium> doesn't Juhani thirst after you if you're a woman?
[1:27:09] <Augus7717> LUL
[1:27:12] <%Chatterbox1991> why does she suckm
[1:27:17] <MasterDecoder> @Irridium HARD
[1:27:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @irridium Absolutely.
[1:27:23] <+SolidusRex> If you're playing as a female lightside Revan, she technically could be a romance interest, but not much happens during that romance
[1:27:25] <%Fujiwara_92> Agreed, outer worlds needed more, we getting a dlc so we'll see
[1:27:28] <%DatAsuna> Is not the biggest dark
[1:27:34] <%DatAsuna> immediate dark is just activate saber
[1:27:39] <SiegeJay> Rule of thumb, if you need someone to persuade you to pick a second option. The choice conflict is no conflict
[1:27:42] <%DatAsuna> never the big funnies
[1:27:43] <Halospaz117> Give them hope, then smother it hard
[1:27:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Outer Worlds is good, but there is just soo much potential that went untapped leaving it ultimately disappointing
[1:27:56] <+Kirbachev> The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and all that
[1:27:59] <+vaporousTippler> Vader would be a boring KotOR protag.
[1:28:05] <%krispen_wa> I hated how every companion in Outer Worlds that wasn't named Parvati was boring
[1:28:06] <Augus7717> aka Twerka industries @WoolieVersus
[1:28:09] <ashenjuan25> Seems like retroactive progressiveness
[1:28:20] <ashenjuan25> Faux progressiveness
[1:28:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ashenjuan25 How is it retroactive when it's literally in the game?
[1:28:26] <%DatAsuna> Standards for star wars were low
[1:28:31] <%DatAsuna> jade empire went harder on it
[1:28:33] <%Irridium> I played through Outer Worlds as an idiot and it was a great time, honestly
[1:28:35] <SiegeJay> @oda_flobunaga The potential was tapped when a woman becomes a leader of barbarians is not played for laughs.
[1:28:43] <Jaku2011> I just want a studio to pick up the Bioware torch and make good party based RPGS again
[1:28:45] <ashenjuan25> The implications of the relationship is retroactive
[1:28:52] <%Fujiwara_92> outer worlds left me "damn, I hope we get a 2 outta this"... I feel that with more money outer worlds will be great
[1:28:57] <+evbites> also outerworlds should have just cut back on the amount of planets and make the map bigger
[1:29:01] <%krispen_wa> @jaku2011 Larian Studios?
[1:29:01] <+oda_flobunaga> @SiegeJay ?
[1:29:02] <+Kirbachev> Juhani is a blank space of a character.
[1:29:04] <%DatAsuna> Woolie won't play jade empire but it's a solid funsies
[1:29:06] <+SolidusRex> She's not a bad character, just a boring one
[1:29:06] <Manly_Rose> @DatAsuna ...now I want to replay Jade Empire
[1:29:12] <%DatAsuna> Juhani's thing is "space russian"
[1:29:13] <%alpacasintophats> she's not Carth
[1:29:17] <%Chatterbox1991> Juhani is fine
[1:29:19] <+DeeJayOkay> I just tuned in but holy jesus Woolie AND Little V? Sup bros!
[1:29:19] <%alpacasintophats> which is a plus
[1:29:21] <vulkan_vibes> she was the worst
[1:29:24] <steelstwitchaccount> Yzma
[1:29:25] <%Fujiwara_92> juhani was ok
[1:29:28] <zocano> Larian dialogue is still... not the greatest
[1:29:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Juhnai was fine
[1:29:39] <ashenjuan25> Blank slates work great for retcons
[1:29:42] <vulkan_vibes> that twilek almost made that episode less great
[1:29:54] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> what about mileena
[1:29:56] <Jaku2011> @krispen_wa They make good stuff but I mean more like Mass Effect or Dragon Age not the top down camera angle
[1:29:57] <+prime_name> Hanharr is this game's Juhani
[1:30:00] <%Chatterbox1991> tbf I like a well done hot head character
[1:30:04] <SiegeJay> @oda_flobunaga Isnt there a questline where you have to rescue someone's gf from bandits but she ends up leading them?
[1:30:12] <%DatAsuna> Also Ulic had a far better version of that with a different Cathar
[1:30:14] <ashenjuan25> Was Bastilla a romance option as a girl?
[1:30:17] <BlackD0G57> hello
[1:30:19] <ashenjuan25> That would have been better
[1:30:19] <steelstwitchaccount> More important shit going on.
[1:30:25] <%DatAsuna> No, the bastilla gay stuf was mods
[1:30:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> If Woolie's first impression of you ain't good, into the fire you go.
[1:30:29] <%Chatterbox1991> but also I fucking haaaaaate a poorly done hot head character
[1:30:33] <ashenjuan25> Same with carth and male characters
[1:30:34] <Shade075> @prime_name Hanharr isn't a jedi though
[1:30:47] <+evbites> pockets:cute i just burned down a house because someone said hi
[1:30:47] <+dragonzord12> it would have been better that you could get her as a party member and keep her dark
[1:30:49] <emeraldskrull> Life tree? More like lame tree. wookies btfo
[1:30:50] <%krispen_wa> Get that hothead outta here!
[1:30:52] <%Fujiwara_92> 100% hanharr is just juhani
[1:30:53] <+oda_flobunaga> @SiegeJay oh yeah, in the first map.. the first map is good overall but the game falls off in the later parts.
[1:30:57] <jorniev> people with terrible taste is that unbelievable woolie?
[1:31:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @fujiwara_92 But he's a Wookie tho
[1:31:14] <BlackD0G57> Chewie is a certified badass
[1:31:19] <%DatAsuna> you don't know what he's saying
[1:31:20] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:31:20] <%Fujiwara_92> @commandersqueaks good point SeemsGood
[1:31:22] <ashenjuan25> Ju’hawny is basically anakin
[1:31:28] <%krispen_wa> Chewie tanked a moon drop. Chewie>Madara
[1:31:31] <%DatAsuna> He could be using the n word without a pass all the time
