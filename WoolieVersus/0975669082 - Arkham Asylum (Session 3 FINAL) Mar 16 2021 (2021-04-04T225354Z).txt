[0:13:35] <%kyh9> It's normalizing the Git Gud process
[0:13:38] <lunocura> @lion_kun he literally kicked woolz' ass in strive
[0:13:44] <%kyh9> Normalize Gitting Gud
[0:13:45] <Asuterisuku> I was just running through BlazBlue trials last night for the heck of it.
[0:13:54] <%L3m0nTwi5t> @lion_Kun woolieKICKDAD
[0:13:55] <NoireRequiem> it took me so many videos to do a shoryu input as a kid, it seemed like rocket science without someone showing me in person
[0:13:58] <@Solidus_113> At the end you could also give a list of footnotes just to make sure they learned
[0:13:59] <%druupy_> Into the fight club
[0:14:01] <%cache_22> Woolie's Fight Lab
[0:14:09] <frostyjay3> @Jiggisnipe Now that would be a very fun episode
[0:14:12] <brachydios777> RIP Blitz netcode
[0:14:33] <+PikeBot> get Into Fighting Games: For Newbies
[0:14:34] <Asuterisuku> Because server based is an effective solution for 1 on 1 games.
[0:14:35] <lunocura> Blitz Netcode is DA FUTURE
[0:14:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Back to the Lab
[0:14:47] <$arcielardor> Call it Get Into the Training Room
[0:14:48] <mankeymania> Fight club
[0:14:48] <+Jiggisnipe> GIFG: For Friends
[0:14:49] <Tatrix912> Cool idea
[0:14:52] <%NorthGrizzly> TRAINING ROOM
[0:14:53] <crocboyz> beginners intro to fighting games
[0:14:55] <dundore77> id love to watch this as i agree get into fighting games is normally a step too high. also whats the videos called you put out for the beginners i remember there was a tekken one a while back
[0:14:58] <BlackermanZX> First rule of the Versus Club. Don't mash wooliePOYO
[0:15:01] <NoireRequiem> clemps would be fun to bring here too
[0:15:03] <frostyjay3> Get into The Lab
[0:15:07] <TheWizardOfWordplay> Training Room or Mode
[0:15:08] <brunoberserk> the true question : you have a cool name ??
[0:15:09] <Asuterisuku> KI would be a good game to do that kind of episode on for a couple reasons.
[0:15:24] <%NorthGrizzly> Versus Dojo
[0:15:25] <%RyTYoung> Woolie will figure THAT out Kappa
[0:15:26] <%bumpynavel> That's a great idea, I dont want to get into them myself but I'd happily watch someone else do it.
[0:15:26] <+Zasne> it's a great idea! doubles as being a beginner tutorial too
[0:15:28] <Asuterisuku> ONE: It's free. TWO: Great netcode
[0:15:30] <BlackermanZX> use parsec and let them do the kof XIII trials Keepo
[0:15:38] <aka_Jigawatt> ^
[0:15:41] <%NorthGrizzly> DOJO VERSUS
[0:15:42] <frostyjay3> Getting into Fighting Games: Day One Edition
[0:15:49] <masandyballs> Woolie is just someone‚Äôs dad teaching them how to ride a bike
[0:15:54] <Clundy> WoolieVS School for Gifted Scrubs
[0:16:02] <BlackermanZX> Dojo Versus sounds cool ngl
[0:16:02] <%Feralspirit41> Versus Dojo with sensei woolie and Reggie
[0:16:03] <%cache_22> Would this be a weekly reoccurring feature on a specific day? That may affect who / when you can play.
[0:16:13] <Equirah> man, i could really use that, i want to get into fg but i suck, barely got confortable with motions
[0:16:15] <velgaduere> I;m down
[0:16:18] <%RyTYoung> I like that
[0:16:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[0:16:19] <velgaduere> I'm too
[0:16:19] <Asuterisuku> It's a cool idea.
[0:16:23] <NoireRequiem> sounds neato
[0:16:24] <@Menitta> thats a fantastic idea
[0:16:24] <@Solidus_113> People will watch whatever you put out
[0:16:28] <joec182> its a great idea
[0:16:31] <@Menitta> It brings a new perspective
[0:16:32] <+Jiggisnipe> the con is finding people who are available but it's a good idea
[0:16:35] <DemonDash666> Great idea
[0:16:36] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Get Into Fighting Games: Enter The Dojo
[0:16:37] <joshua_42> Sounds like a good idea man
[0:16:38] <+nabs2099> Dude I'm always down
[0:16:40] <%dreadedcthulhu> id def catch the youtube
[0:16:40] <ghoulian420> Hell yea
[0:16:43] <%saladin1911> This sounds like a good idea every now and then.
[0:16:44] <%ChoculaUltra> I don't like it. I love it.
[0:16:47] <%RyTYoung> Last fighting game I was deep into was SF IV, it would be nice to get back into them
[0:16:56] <Asuterisuku> I actually got into fighters with the help of a similar series on a channel that has since shut down.
[0:16:56] <+kraajkase> Strive could be my first fighting game, so yeah this would be really cool
[0:16:57] <masandyballs> Fighting Dreamers
[0:17:00] <%ggbhtg> I'm always down for seeing things from a newbie's perspective.
[0:17:00] <joec182> babies first fighting game
[0:17:01] <brachydios777> I just remembered, I saw that Ultraman is in that Mechacity brawl sequel
[0:17:05] <%dreadedcthulhu> include the "WHOOOAAA" jump and im sold
[0:17:06] <BlackermanZX> Teach the younglings how dope Skullgirls is
[0:17:06] <%Nested_Dreams> Well, I'm wondering if you are ready for very low levels of general fighing game familiarity
[0:17:15] <deafmelone> Sounds pretty cool
[0:17:21] <+nabs2099> Hell, I suck at fighting games and always wanted to get into them. I would really appreciate a series like that.
[0:17:27] <Tatrix912> I'm down, always like to absorb as much because I can fall off a game here and there
[0:17:45] <%Nested_Dreams> Cause there is not understanding inputs or combos, and there's not understanding holding back to block
[0:17:47] <aka_Jigawatt> just shove em
[0:17:48] <NoireRequiem> I think it'd be cool if the new person chose the game they'd like to learn
[0:17:49] <%wibbwobbler> very interesting to watch for sure
[0:17:55] <%LCLSmoothie> kick em
[0:17:58] <+nabs2099> PLEASE GIVE ME DA PUSH WOOLIE
[0:17:59] <%akuda_bar> NYEH *shove*
[0:18:10] <%saladin1911> I would love to play more Fighting Games but there's nothing out that I'm interested in ATM. Can't wait for Strive and KoF15 to dig in again
[0:18:13] <kamenspidey> well no one heres gonna tell you no
[0:18:13] <TheWizardOfWordplay> pick a top tier
[0:18:21] <BlackermanZX> teach us how to tech that throw
[0:18:21] <joshua_42> Just pick a top tier
[0:18:24] <ghoulian420> Pick a top tier
[0:18:24] <+nabs2099> although I definitely follow Woolie's thing of picking a character who I think looks cool lol
[0:18:29] <masandyballs> Carrot or the stick? Reggie shoves one in each end
[0:18:34] <+nabs2099> And enjoying trying them all
[0:18:39] <@Solidus_113> Imagine blocking
[0:18:42] <@Solidus_113> that's cheap
[0:18:43] <lunocura> pick a top tier if you're a pusdy
[0:18:50] <NoireRequiem> thuggery philosophy
[0:18:50] <%LCLSmoothie> i would simply not get hit
[0:18:59] <+EdenOfLove> I literally only play mortal kombat where there's a block button so learning how to press back to block was actually a challenge
[0:19:01] <CaptainBright> Imagine blocking; then getting thrown
[0:19:12] <Asuterisuku> Approaching is an offensive action while retreating is defensive. It took me a long time to flip that switch in my head.
[0:19:16] <+bigchuck> people have to be willing to do homework to really enjoy FGs and I‚Äôm tired of that being a hot take
[0:19:41] <+EdenOfLove> The challenge of FPS is pointpoint accuracy, reflexes that rival fite games, and situational awareness
[0:19:55] <miucsa51> what did i miss?
[0:19:57] <Jashter18> For me it's motions fighting game motions for weird to do
[0:19:58] <frostyjay3> @bigchuck I totally agree
[0:20:00] <marvel877> So... stop wall hugging and second/third/fourth guessing my actions?
[0:20:05] <slix3431> This is OUR game
[0:20:09] <Asuterisuku> Situational awareness is arguably the BIGGEST thing in shooters.
[0:20:11] <@Menitta> And clearly the first fighting game for this subseries will be Pokken
[0:20:23] <%alexisofthestars> Mankind knew that they could not learn how to hold back to block, so instead of reflecting upon themselves, they blamed the opponent.
[0:20:26] <Lancaster_H> @EdenOfLove depends on the FPS, counter strike and the likes is half the times correct strategy as well
[0:20:29] <slix3431> A boomer cut me in line this morning
[0:20:29] <Asuterisuku> You can make up for poor aim by knowing that someone's coming around that corner.
[0:20:30] <marvel877> I REALLY hope for another Pokken game.
[0:20:43] <NoireRequiem> GIFG Alpha?
[0:20:43] <Equirah> @WoolieVersus is it okay to have a fg niche? most people treat fg franchises as a buffet but I think i only have one dish that i like and maybe i'll take different seasoning on it from time to time

[0:25:08] <Grunkle_Dan_> I feel like Arkham Origins is unfairly judged. Its hard to match up to a masterpiece like Arkham City. But it was still good imo.
[0:25:15] <%Feralspirit41> Id like to see gifg dojo series

[0:25:30] <%Feralspirit41> origins was meh
[0:25:31] <Asuterisuku> @Grunkle_Dan_ But it's also kind of broken as a game, thanks WB.
[0:25:34] <%emptyantics> Origins is UNDERRATED
[0:25:38] <%agoaj> Origins has the best story and boss fights. Combat balance is all over the place though.

[0:25:39] <iLike_femboys> arkham origins has the best version of Bane
[0:25:40] <leith_aziz> Its a fun time regardless
[0:25:40] <brachydios777> Baman and Piderman is pretty old
[0:25:40] <peachy996> I'd say Origins is upper mid
[0:25:40] <%itschickenscratch> itschickenscratch gifted a Tier 1 sub to emptyantics!
[0:25:41] <+bigchuck> arkham city is bounds better than asylum just for how much fun traversal ia
[0:25:42] <brunoberserk> for the pupil
[0:25:47] <%Feralspirit41> has its ups and downs but not on par as city or knight
[0:25:50] <Skul1b3ard> Origins is better than Knight but that's hardly glowing praise
[0:26:01] <CaptainBright> I'd say if you feel that City is the peak, you can stop there and just watch the other two games

[0:26:07] <MinersLoveGames> City is the best
[0:26:09] <leith_aziz> They are WAY to strict
[0:26:12] <Grunkle_Dan_> Origins is worth it for the chilly Christmas atmosphere by itself imo
[0:26:12] <brunoberserk> GIFG : way of the hadou
[0:26:13] <BlackermanZX> City was pretty good
[0:26:17] <Skul1b3ard> I personally prefer Asylum to City but both are good
[0:26:20] <iLike_femboys> arkham city is def the best
[0:26:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> "oh yeah that's mine" has been a phrase a friend of mines been using for years...and I forgot it was Baman meme.
[0:26:27] <leith_aziz> I also like the christmas atmosphere
[0:26:29] <Doctadaking> I prefer City
[0:26:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Atleast do city
[0:26:35] <Grunkle_Dan_> City is the GOAT
[0:26:36] <coreybom> @grunkle_dan_ It‚Äôs a good game, a very good one in fact. But it came out AFTER arkham city, so the expectations were high, ESPECIALLY since origins was made by a different team than the rest of series.
[0:26:36] <Prevot> be warned the others are not this short
[0:26:36] <+YaBish311> I know that it‚Äôs actual Arkham fans in here with the City love
[0:26:39] <leith_aziz> Best one ? I say Asylum/city
[0:26:41] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus Fair points on the jank. But how good is the art?
[0:26:41] <brachydios777> City has the best story
[0:26:47] <leith_aziz> I cant decide between them
[0:26:50] <BlackermanZX> also city may have the same dmca issue
[0:26:52] <rideroftraps1> Halo was a shotgun of content
[0:26:52] <Skul1b3ard> You can accidentally progress in City and miss out on some good shit super easily though
[0:26:52] <%Feralspirit41> City is the cow level
[0:26:55] <%agoaj> Sponsored stream to play the first 13 hours of Batman Arkham 7
[0:26:58] <+bigchuck> video games!!!!
[0:26:59] <+RowenCleric> these games are too long and similiar for a lp series Id say
[0:27:01] <Meltgar> Batman: WOOLIEHOLE Asylum Kappa
[0:27:06] <iLike_femboys> batman arkham city also has the best easter eggs
[0:27:08] <%Nested_Dreams> GITFG: Step One
[0:27:16] <Tracazoid> I think City is the best in most regards, outside of how easy it is to trivialize the combat challenges with Batswarm.
[0:27:21] <Asuterisuku> Jujutsu is neat.
[0:27:22] <Skul1b3ard> Like I was hugely disappointed in City first playthrough as I missed a bunch of interesting side missions
[0:27:28] <%Feralspirit41> GIFG; low combo
[0:27:28] <%dreadedcthulhu> jjk is sick
[0:27:30] <leith_aziz> @RowenCleric: I'd say City is different enougj
[0:27:30] <BlackermanZX> JJK is amazing
[0:27:34] <leith_aziz> Eyy. Kizzie

[0:27:47] <iLike_femboys> ALSO this games have the best kind of collectibles, the ones that show up in the map, so you dont have to search for them blind
[0:27:52] <brachydios777> I‚Äôm so glad that both Batman and Spider-man has a bunch of good ass video games

[0:29:21] <%jinking79> kof trials r like Egypt text
[0:29:30] <%saladin1911> I literally can't do jump ins on KoF13 after like 70hours of play
[0:29:42] <%emptyantics> KoF trials are god‚Äôs way to punish us for not GETTING GUD
[0:29:42] <Grunkle_Dan_> i hope we arent setting Woolie up to be underwhelmed with Arkham City, he must see how much everyone loves it.
[0:29:49] <%Feralspirit41> I forgot woolie was in THIS building
[0:29:54] <leith_aziz> I to this day have never played a KOF
[0:29:57] <HotSauceFiend> Not sure if someone asked already, How are you enjoying using Detective Vision all the time?

[0:32:31] <srv4254> juju hakushow
[0:32:34] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Mappa is always solid
[0:32:34] <%agoaj> it means Japanese Show
[0:32:41] <Grunkle_Dan_> eating something spicy and im making sounds like Woolie on hot pepper gaming D:
[0:32:42] <+froduck42> the literal translation is "Sorcery Fight"
[0:32:42] <%emptyantics> Sorcerer Fight doesn‚Äôt sound too bad
[0:32:42] <BlackermanZX> Untranslated. Its pretty much sorcerer fight
[0:32:43] <cosmicgoatee> Curse Sorceror Naruto LUL
[0:32:52] <%agoaj> Wizard Warz
[0:32:53] <iLike_femboys> I refunded cyberpunk 2077 to get the arkham collection for me and a friend B)
[0:32:55] <+RJay80> dang
[0:32:58] <dreadedcthulhu> it's like bleach but in 2021
[0:33:01] <Asuterisuku> V mentioned it in another stream too, I'm surprised Woolie isn't on board yet.
[0:33:01] <frostyjay3> I really like the animation of the show and Itadori is a fun shonen protagonist that doesn't get on my nerves
[0:33:03] <aka_Jigawatt> Wah thar
[0:33:08] <+Javatron69> ryomen sukun deez nuts
[0:33:09] <dundore77> the "kakashi" of the show is amazing
[0:33:12] <brachydios777> @ilike_femboys Wise investment
[0:33:14] <%emptyantics> @ilike_femboys A wise choice Akrham games are fun af
[0:33:16] <mankeymania> definitely city
[0:33:19] <Asuterisuku> @dreadedcthulhu You say that, but there's a new season of Bleach on the way this year.
[0:33:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> City combat s amazing
[0:33:21] <@Solidus_113> Funnily enough, the remaster also fixed the combat LUL
[0:33:24] <iLike_femboys> @emptyantics i also got red dead 2 :3
[0:33:27] <+spodebroker> Arkham Origins has the best combat, weirdly enough
[0:33:30] <miucsa51> city KomodoHype
[0:33:30] <peachy996> In City it gets better, Origins is altered slightly and Knight I don't think changes much of it
[0:33:32] <+Katohearts> Ah yeah I love hour late twitch notification
[0:33:38] <cosmicgoatee> the 'kakashi' of the show dwarfs the regular Kakashi by leaps and bounds
[0:33:40] <%aram909> arkham city really fucks up the combat
[0:33:46] <+Beniial> use the Bat Rubber Boots
[0:33:55] <Asuterisuku> Also, Burn the Witch was great.
[0:33:57] <%aram909> theres a lot more like, gadget combos and stuff but the timing for parrying and shit is way way way more relaxed
[0:33:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @katohearts just started the game
[0:33:59] <jamsbybetty> ya the later games are fire too but you're playing some h i s t o r y
[0:34:03] <TheWizardOfWordplay> Knight adds QOL into the combat
[0:34:04] <brian_peppers1> Jesus Christ what are these hot takes in the chat
[0:34:05] <MinersLoveGames> city irons out a lot of the kinks
[0:34:05] <DatAsuna> personally I hate how much batman moves without me movingthestick
[0:34:07] <zepelinnn1> i remember getting stuck in this part for a while
[0:34:12] <zepelinnn1> for being a dummy
[0:34:15] <iLike_femboys> cirt def has the best combat
[0:34:15] <%aram909> and batman's movement are way way way less limited to the point where he can fly 50 feet across the room to hit dudes
[0:34:17] <Asuterisuku> BIG combo counter at the side of the screen
[0:34:17] <Meltgar> Man, Arkham cleaners dissapeared or something?? EVERYTHING IS COVERED IN MUD zyzxLmao zyzxLmao
[0:34:17] <%aram909> and it just looks goofy
[0:34:19] <Grunkle_Dan_> most important thing to learn is not to spam. After that its gravy.
[0:34:22] <+PikeBot> Woolie didn't you play Shadow of Mordor?
[0:34:23] <%SeedTabulous> Hi Wookiee hi chat :)
[0:34:24] <Clundy> I didn‚Äôt learn that until Arkham City
[0:34:27] <peachy996> This game have Bat Swarm? Or is that introduced in City?
[0:34:29] <%aram909> arkham origins fixes all of that but then arkham knight breaks it again
[0:34:30] <baietzas_doru> go back pull the vets
[0:34:30] <iLike_femboys> @SeedTabulous heyo
[0:34:30] <%SeedTabulous> Oh Jesus Christ auto correct
[0:34:30] <GarbageNirvana> assassin's Creed is a poor example of any genre
[0:34:33] <Aydarkzero> the number going up is great
[0:34:34] <DatAsuna> there's combos in those too tho
[0:34:37] <+Mkingston> despite the word combo being on the top on the screen every time you fight
[0:34:39] <+MightyDuckShoes> it's like the energy charge in ps4 spider-man
[0:34:39] <+Javaa01> Assassin's Creed combat was just a simplified imitation that for the longest time was just counter to win
[0:34:41] <Lancaster_H> @aram909 you can do the flying across room thing in asylum as well
[0:34:42] <%NorthGrizzly> ...
[0:34:44] <+samuraiknack> Origins fucked the combat timing
[0:34:47] <%Seancicle> hold that d Reggie
[0:34:48] <OldManDeckardCain> just DO COMBO
[0:34:52] <+Undenizen> it's not a thing you HAVE to do unless you play on higher difficulties
[0:34:54] <@Solidus_113> instant takedowns at x5 hits
[0:34:55] <BlackermanZX> yeah combos end fights faster with the big moves
[0:35:00] <Aydarkzero> it's like the one game I care about my Combo going up
[0:35:00] <Asuterisuku> Scan that bench.

[0:44:39] <Kostas1001> those people are wrong
[0:44:40] <Asuterisuku> Detective Vision is OP.
[0:44:43] <TuxedoNash> I used it as the "eh, I'm stuck - where am I going?" button
[0:44:44] <anAngryHamster> The only reason to turn off detective vision is eye strain
[0:44:47] <Kostas1001> dont be wrong woolie
[0:44:50] <leith_aziz> @Mkingston That's an awfull solution
[0:44:56] <+BananaSlammuh> The only reason not too is that it ruins any kind of aesthetic design to the game
[0:44:59] <+chosenjuan42> detective vision is fine but you miss a lot of environmental details
[0:44:59] <%sniffy77> time to do the wiggles
[0:45:01] <Arancet> yeah, lotta people did, its a problem with the game. it still sucks to watch
[0:45:01] <%akuda_bar> batman do you have games on your phone
[0:45:04] <brachydios777> Luckily they fix that problem by City
[0:45:06] <+Undenizen> the counterpoint is the ingenuity of human creation is more interesting than the stagnant equilibrium of nature
[0:45:08] <NoireRequiem> I prefer having it on only when i'm searching or in stealth missions
[0:45:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's fine if you do it, just don't do it at the cost of pretty environment...or at least as pretty as 2009 can get
[0:45:14] <leith_aziz> Knight I say fixes this
[0:45:14] <Clundy> Bweeeezeeeiorrp
[0:45:15] <%aram909> batman just surreptitiously looking around
[0:45:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> maybe if Poison Ivy made giant maneating plants sprout around Multi billionaire oil framing tycoons, we wouldn't have this problem. But no. her first target is those ghettos
[0:45:18] <cosmicgoatee> i make sure to photograph in every room because the damn toddler trophies could be hidden everywhere
[0:45:19] <majindusto> RULE OF 3
[0:45:20] <leith_aziz> With the enemies at least
[0:45:21] <%aram909> "hope no one sees me on my PSP"
[0:45:22] <Asuterisuku> Whew, he barely made it under the time limit.
[0:45:27] <+AkronymCLT> oh man
[0:45:31] <%Robot_Nixon_> electronics dont do that atpCap
[0:45:31] <haitakaa> batman playing gameboy
[0:45:32] <+Spankminister> @Undenizen The dinosaurs want to talk with you about "stagnant equilibrium"
[0:45:36] <Lancaster_H> wow
[0:45:40] <velgaduere> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ sounds like something Ivy would say... 2020Suspicious
[0:45:43] <Clundy> Batman has a Nintendo PSP XL
[0:45:48] <iLike_femboys> you need to upgrade the hacking device to do that puzzle
[0:45:50] <Ashenik1> ''Looks like'' ?!? So he was just destroying shit around hopiing it will work?
[0:45:55] <%X2Eliah> Playing with Detective Mode on vs. off is the choice between green mush or blue-gray mush in screen.
[0:45:59] <Grunkle_Dan_> what do people think of Gotham Knights? I'm worried D:
[0:46:09] <BlackermanZX> Batman has that switch pro tech
[0:46:12] <+bigchuck> @undenizen imagine using the words ‚Äústagnant‚Äù and ‚Äúnature‚Äù in the same sentence.
[0:46:13] <Ghostbody> @Grunkle_Dan_ I'm interested honestly
[0:46:16] <dekkitout> "Imagine Bats, an attack- OF TITANS"
[0:46:18] <+FuqBoiSlim> @mightyduckshoes truuuu. just sic the giant pitcher plants onto the billionaires and more of the work is done instantly
[0:46:20] <leith_aziz> @Grunkle_Dan_ Knight is 50/50 but a good game. Very devisive
[0:46:20] <+MightyDuckShoes> Batman: I emulate with my Batstation XL
[0:46:20] <+Undenizen> @Spankminister Dinosaurs - ah - had their shot and nature, uh, selected them.. for extinction
[0:46:24] <%ChoculaUltra> looks cool but I remain hesitant monkaS

[0:46:33] <GarbageNirvana> At least he's having fun
[0:46:33] <Clundy> I‚Äôm scared of the leveling system and intention long grind in Knights
[0:46:33] <+pizzabambino> @Grunkle_Dan_ It looks cool SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:46:35] <NoireRequiem> joker needs new hobbies
[0:46:36] <Tardispardis> the Ratcheter?
[0:46:37] <Depthcharge2030> ah yes, ratcatcher
[0:46:38] <Grunkle_Dan_> @Ghostbody its one of those situations where i hope my worries are completely unfounded
[0:46:39] <majindusto> Ratcheter?
[0:46:39] <%agoaj> Now kiss the guard back to life
[0:46:40] <+BananaSlammuh> @Grunkle_Dan_ Unfortunate that it's seemingly not a continuation and rough frame rate but cool otherwise
[0:46:40] <iLike_femboys> the ratcatcher comics are so fucked up
[0:46:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @velgaduere damn, she got me
[0:46:42] <Halospaz117> The Ratcheter and Clanker

[0:46:46] <+AkronymCLT> ngage is a pull
[0:46:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> Nature don't give a shit what people do, look at chernobyl
[0:46:47] <Asuterisuku> The statues are nothing.
[0:46:49] <Ashenik1> Knights presenation of the story is awesome but the sotry itself ....
[0:46:49] <SheefEatsBeef> damn...
[0:46:50] <peachy996> Ratcheter would be a sick villain for Tim the Tool Man Taylor
[0:46:53] <Depthcharge2030> its his costume stashed in the airvent

[0:47:00] <%ChoculaUltra> can't be any worse than that Avengers game. I hope. monkaS
[0:47:01] <+SolidusRex> Rat Catcher
[0:47:05] <Dante_Namikaze1> @grunkle_dan_ I hope it's good but the lack of any news at all is worring

[0:48:02] <%aram909> @Tuna_Can_0 but apparently if you kill the joker you become a megalomaniacal tyrant who then proceeds to become a dictator over the entire planet earth a la Injustice
[0:48:02] <+BigBlackBankai> Maybe its in the vent.

[0:48:30] <Skul1b3ard> Some of the Riddler stuff is cool to get purely because of the character bios, I wasn't all that familiar with Batman past the Animated series until I played this so it was cool seeing all the interpretations of his rogues' gallery
[0:48:32] <%cache_22> Ichiban would eat those
[0:48:36] <+Undenizen> Batman fights crime because he compulsively HAS to, not because he has a strong sense of justice
[0:48:37] <Asuterisuku> Particularly to the right.
[0:48:39] <%ekodrop> paige's potato salad

[0:49:51] <HolyGriddles> I love finding the riddles. It‚Äôs like Easter Egg hunting. Everything else Riddler is meh
[0:49:52] <marvel877> I don't know, okra always looked more alien to me than mushrooms. Taste good though.
[0:49:52] <velgaduere> monkaS ?
[0:49:53] <Lancaster_H> shit food opinions never stop
[0:49:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Reggie, when you're starving you don't care

[0:50:06] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus Your kinda simplifying it a bit. It's a pretty nice hobby if you know your mushrooms
[0:50:06] <Dante_Namikaze1> @tuna_can_0 it's more of the issue that the state does not ever think hey let's put the Joker on the death penalty because you know Batman is not the person that kills anybody
[0:50:06] <Komayeda> Platforming Time
[0:50:07] <+Undenizen> two mushrooms: Trumpets of death and Destroying angel. Guess which one is delicious, and which one will kill you horribly in 30 minutes?
[0:50:07] <Clundy> Sewer Mushrooms tastiest mushrooms
[0:50:08] <leith_aziz> This area is very echoy
[0:50:08] <AzirothTheGreat> 4000, but we‚Äôve been eating them for longer then that.
[0:50:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> It's a ghost
[0:50:12] <peachy996> I remember getting spooked by these voices
[0:50:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hate this par5
[0:50:16] <%orcstr16> Oh, it's time for platforming
[0:50:17] <dabeaminator> Hey chat, I just got here. What have I missed?
[0:50:17] <leith_aziz> Pretty atmospheric
[0:50:19] <Asuterisuku> Sounds like the Joker's busy.
[0:50:19] <%wibbwobbler> I like this environment for some reason
[0:50:23] <+bigchuck> today on ‚ÄúWoolie shits on nothing for no reason...‚Äù
[0:50:27] <Rubecks> It's just batman high on sewer mushrooms
[0:50:28] <%aram909> no you can eat raw mushrooms, depends on the mushroom
[0:50:28] <leith_aziz> @dabeaminator Some Ivy tapes and thats it
[0:50:29] <MinersLoveGames> edible mushrooms are great. chicken stroganoff with mushrooms on top is DELICIOUS.
[0:50:29] <%jonblnt> first peanut butter with Woolie now mushrooms with Reggie. disappointed
[0:50:30] <darkfilled> look mushrooms are good, ok?
[0:50:31] <velgaduere> I distinctly remember these voice lines. this room is fucking agony
[0:50:31] <thelivingglitch307> Me and the boys at 11pm cooking up Titan
[0:50:35] <+condemned_15> certain mushrooms
[0:50:35] <+Mkingston> you shouldn't
[0:50:37] <HotSauceFiend> No?
[0:50:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> I mean, depends on the mushroom right?
[0:50:37] <+bigchuck> mushrooms rule
[0:50:38] <+Ricky_Rexx> Some mushrooms are totally fine raw
[0:50:40] <$doomerskeletor13> I think it depends on the mushroom
[0:50:40] <brachydios777> Thought that was hatter for a second
[0:50:40] <+YaBish311> Lo-fi tunes to fight lunatics to
[0:50:40] <+Jiggisnipe> Subway has mushrooms?
[0:50:41] <@Solidus_113> Steaming is the worst way to cook vegetables
[0:50:43] <+PikeBot> I...don't think SUbway even has mushrooms?
[0:50:46] <Asuterisuku> White mushrooms are fine raw.
[0:50:48] <marvel877> That's why you toast the sandwich, Woolie.
[0:50:49] <peachy996> That's why you don't eat mushrooms period
[0:50:49] <%saltpiggu> you just saying shit
[0:50:50] <+Undenizen> you can eat some mushrooms raw
[0:50:53] <%MrKerb> Subway bread is not bread here in Ireland
[0:50:55] <Ashenik1> steaming is the worst
[0:50:56] <Clundy> Subway eat somewhat fresh
[0:50:56] <HotSauceFiend> The Subway in Ontario has cooked mushrooms?
[0:50:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Solidus_113 Boiling is infinitely worse
[0:50:59] <dabeaminator> @leith_aziz Thanks!
[0:51:02] <+Javaa01> Some mushrooms are perfectly fine as is, some you have to cook tho
[0:51:05] <Dante_Namikaze1> Subway doesn't even have mushrooms
[0:51:06] <%ekodrop> crazy people talking
[0:51:07] <asurite_warrior> You need to wash them or not eat the part that has dirt
[0:51:08] <%Robot_Nixon_> @Dante_Namikaze1 lol yea I mean cops wouldn't be too keen on a moral code if their lives were in danger
[0:51:08] <brachydios777> Mushrooms are really good
[0:51:09] <NoireRequiem> fact checking will ruin the stream
[0:51:09] <Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus just a second ago I was swigging milk out the carton just to realize too late that it was 10 days past expectations
[0:51:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> If it's a mushroom you get from the supermarket, sure, mushrooms you find in a subway bathroom? Maybe broil that shit a little
[0:51:12] <+Mkingston> Mushrooms, even common button mushrooms, contain traces of carcinogenic compounds in raw form. ... You might think nothing of eating a few slices of button mushrooms raw, but to get the anti-cancer effects of mushrooms, eat them cooked.
[0:51:13] <Grunkle_Dan_> i just got subway today...i forgot how much i didnt like subway...
[0:51:19] <HotSauceFiend> Subway doesnt have real bread, but it definitely has mushrooms
[0:51:22] <$doomerskeletor13> Ratcatcher, now there‚Äôs a d-List villain
[0:51:28] <darkfilled> i eat a certain kind of mushrooms that have certain effects on ur mind lol

[1:08:24] <leith_aziz> Working at this place must be a nightmare
[1:08:25] <DedlokPM> @Superbro64 You also gotta remember that until recently the Among Us dev team was entirely 3 people. (1 programmer and 2 artists). Since they sudden popularity spike they expanded to FIVE people. 2 programmers, 2 artists, and a community manager.

[1:11:14] <%Dakuu75> OOOOOH the killer mouth from Teen Titans, I remember THAT one. with the weird spoiled daughter
[1:11:15] <+MightyDuckShoes> Teen Titans used lots of obscure villains
[1:11:16] <Depthcharge2030> dug him up and put him in the ceiling
[1:11:17] <%ZeeJiggle> Against popular demand, Killer Moth is BACK.
[1:11:17] <leith_aziz> aww
[1:11:17] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Killer Moth is a jobber villain who thinks himself as the "Anti-Batman"
[1:11:18] <dekkitout> @leith_aziz That was Firefly
[1:11:18] <%Deft_Thought> 5'9" in the Batman universe makes you a manlet
[1:11:18] <mr_sups> Teen Titans is good
[1:11:19] <+HollowMan190> it was one of the best episodes
[1:11:20] <+VidulaSaix> Teen Titans was dope
[1:11:22] <puluxor> Look at those plaform shoes
[1:11:24] <%shad8snake> its a good show
[1:11:24] <+Javaa01> They dug up practically everyone during this franchise
[1:11:26] <Dio_TR> teen titans good
[1:11:28] <CoffeeShopA> Where's Egghead tho
[1:11:28] <+Superbro64> He is literally a different character in teen titans, he's practically man bat
[1:11:28] <asurite_warrior> Werid bulge on him
[1:11:28] <fakeangelbr> killer moth was an A-lister together with luthor and joker, but he faded into obscurity
[1:11:30] <@Solidus_113> great show, new season coming
[1:11:30] <TheWizardOfWordplay> he's stayed around sporadically
[1:11:31] <%kewlmyc> Oh shit, yeah he was in the Prom episode of Teen Titans
[1:11:31] <eldragon_1> Beast Boy adopted one of his monster moths
[1:11:32] <+BigBlackBankai> He was the best character in The Batman.
[1:11:33] <MinersLoveGames> teen titans is awesome
[1:11:34] <Jaysky> Titans was pretty good at times, others less so
[1:11:36] <CoffeeShopA> Or Bookworm
[1:11:36] <+KgKid51> teen titans goü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
[1:11:38] <+Story_Ark> teen Titans? does woolie mean teen titans go? dont remember this character
[1:11:41] <Doctadaking> Teen Titans had Slade. Its automatically good cus of that
[1:11:41] <Ashenik1> @Solidus_113 WHAT?!?
[1:11:41] <fakeangelbr> now he is just the designated jobber for batgirl
[1:11:41] <+Superbro64> @solidus_113 get out! really?
[1:11:41] <Asuterisuku> I remember we got Puffy Ami Yumi around the same time because they did the OP for that show.
[1:11:42] <leith_aziz> @dekkitout No, I know what I said. Firefly looked completely different
[1:11:43] <Depthcharge2030> we need king tut
[1:11:43] <%ConLin_Arts_> Justice League and Justice League Unlimited are godlike series
[1:11:44] <MikeStrider> i can't remember, i feel like he had a fun moment in Brave and the Bold
[1:11:44] <%bPlusPlus> the rogues gallery can't all be homeruns
[1:11:46] <+Story_Ark> (is joke dont kill)
[1:11:47] <+spodebroker> The most notable thing he ever did was jobbing to Batgirl in her first appearance.
[1:11:48] <%X2Eliah> I like how he coordinated the colors of his leather boots and his leather underwear
[1:11:50] <%Xelhesia> teen titans was great. teen titans go is trash
[1:11:56] <leith_aziz> I think Teen Titans was great
[1:11:56] <MinersLoveGames> developed my first cartoon crush with Raven.
[1:11:59] <Jaysky> Right, Slade's voice was fucking BUTTER
[1:12:01] <peachy996> Lol obsessed with fame
[1:12:02] <$LightningLynx89> Clout Chaser!
[1:12:03] <leith_aziz> But that was so long ago now
[1:12:03] <%kewlmyc> He looked way cooler in Teen Titans, funny enough
[1:12:07] <+SolidusRex> Starfire is best girl, FIGHT ME
[1:12:10] <+Jiggisnipe> he was that moth guy in Teen Titans with the daughter
[1:12:11] <+Superbro64> teen titans season ending was beast boy getting friend zoned :(
[1:12:14] <%Dakuu75> @Doctadaking he was the grey moth character that stole starfire's Silkie pet and turned it into a big moth monster
[1:12:16] <deafmelone> Riddler Shooketh
[1:12:19] <Asuterisuku> The fact that the show renamed Deathstroke because of their audience was always funny.
[1:12:19] <Jaysky> Why fight you? You're right.
[1:12:23] <Asuterisuku> "WHO IS SLADE?"
[1:12:24] <mar_krow> But robin we saw no slade
[1:12:26] <darkfilled> meh, batman could take out all of the teen titans ez.
[1:12:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> >insecurity >Dress up as a moth
[1:12:29] <Asuterisuku> But his name is Slade Wilson.
[1:12:32] <%jinking79> wasn't he in the Long Halloween comic or Batgirl year one
[1:12:40] <%bPlusPlus> beast boy more like simp boy
[1:12:40] <DedlokPM> @Story_Ark No he was in Teen Titans for a couple episodes. Starfire got that big Larva pet thing from him
[1:12:40] <Ashenik1> @SolidusRex Raven and her Goth Ass though
[1:12:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[1:12:41] <DeadlyWest> @Asuterisuku I mean he stil ended up being the best incarnation of Deathstroke ever
[1:12:43] <+MightyDuckShoes> Deathstroke is a shit name anyway
[1:12:45] <+spodebroker> Yeah he was junking79
[1:12:46] <%X2Eliah> Every time?
[1:12:49] <leith_aziz> @jinking79 I dont remeber seeing him in the former
[1:12:49] <%X2Eliah> Every time.
[1:12:49] <Dante_Namikaze1> @asuterisuku well they didn't remake him the just called him by his last name
[1:12:50] <HotSauceFiend> MAybe hiting the Bomb will turn it off
[1:12:50] <MinersLoveGames> SLADE is a much rawer name, though.
[1:12:50] <DeadlyWest> Slade was a fucking U N I T
[1:12:52] <eldragon_1> Slade was so good in that show
[1:12:52] <Asuterisuku> Not even wrong.
[1:12:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Super Hacking
[1:12:53] <peachy996> Calm down there, Virgil
[1:13:03] <some_brave_apollo> he used to be "The Teminator" but James Cameron stole it
[1:13:04] <%bPlusPlus> SLADE GOT THE DRIPS
[1:13:05] <Asuterisuku> @Dante_Namikaze1 Not even his last name, his first name.
[1:13:06] <Darren716> Man they made the hacking so much better once they added the words
[1:13:07] <+KgKid51> nice
[1:13:07] <+AzureWolfStrke> Ron Perlman as Slade was awesome.
[1:13:08] <miucsa51> digonal
[1:13:09] <BlackermanZX> Deathstroke? you mean the halo symbol guy? StinkyGlitch
[1:13:10] <+Story_Ark> hey chat what episode of Teen Titans Go was killer moth in? ü§îü§î
[1:13:14] <velgaduere> excuse me
[1:13:15] <+skyheys> dude what
[1:13:16] <jtsoppy137> nani
[1:13:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> REALLY
[1:13:17] <+MightyDuckShoes> Ron Perlman as Slade. C'est Magnifique
[1:13:17] <Tardispardis> Deathstroke The Terminator is such a dumb name that i just love it
[1:13:18] <Ultimatefool> Who built that and why
[1:13:18] <%Dakuu75> this is some goofy-shit lmao
[1:13:20] <leith_aziz> Slade was cool in Titans, but they never called him DEATHSTROKE because of ratings
[1:13:20] <lunocura> I can't get over Batman pulling out his gameboy
[1:13:20] <Ashenik1> Slade was actauly a fun vilian
[1:13:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Masaka
[1:13:21] <MikeStrider> i just caught up and completed this game last night. I'm ready
[1:13:22] <CoffeeSlice> what the fuck
[1:13:23] <+VidulaSaix> NO SHUT UP THO
[1:13:23] <HotSauceFiend> IT WAS ALL JOKER
[1:13:24] <$doomerskeletor13> Famous Halo player Deathstroke
[1:13:26] <brachydios777> Who built this?
[1:13:26] <Dio_TR> @Story_Ark episode 69
[1:13:27] <Enyoyable> SECRET
[1:13:28] <deviljhojho_> arkham was weird
[1:13:28] <Dio_TR> Kappa
[1:13:30] <+Ricky_Rexx> Why tho?
[1:13:30] <+KgKid51> oh I like this fight
[1:13:35] <Depthcharge2030> built that but guards still only get 15 an hour
[1:13:35] <Skul1b3ard> This has probably already been mentioned but B (the Batman Button) is really useful even on the normal enemies. It can extend your combo or give you time to be able to anticipate the next attack. USE THE BATMAN BUTTON, WOOLIE.
[1:13:37] <Lancaster_H> arkham didnt build this joker did
[1:13:39] <+spodebroker> Forget Deathstroke
[1:13:41] <Jaysky> Slade is definitely different in his approach than Deathstroke
[1:13:42] <Holycow8498> I feel like you can end most things at Ron Perlman was fucking amazing
[1:13:42] <+spodebroker> Forget Slade
[1:13:43] <@Solidus_113> bad boss fight time
[1:13:44] <%kewlmyc> Jebaited
[1:13:45] <Tracazoid> Arkham belonged in his own Asylum really.

[1:13:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> HULK
[1:13:48] <Asuterisuku> Hey, remember the Bane fight?
[1:13:48] <MinersLoveGames> Ron Perlman the GOAT as Slade.
[1:13:51] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> DOUBLE BANE ACTION
[1:13:52] <%Afterman_> pats worst nightmare
[1:13:52] <+Jiggisnipe> @Story_Ark remember that moth man with the super bratty daughter?
[1:13:54] <peachy996> Working for the Joker must be great

[1:14:28] <DatAsuna> don't you love these fights?
[1:14:29] <Asuterisuku> The boss fights in this game are kind of bad, and Pat's already told you that.

[1:14:35] <MikeStrider> always hated the slow down when you dodge, it's the slowest ever
[1:14:36] <+spodebroker> Your batarangs can only hurt them when they're roaring, Woolie

[1:17:38] <%wibbwobbler> yes
[1:17:42] <brachydios777> Not the best
[1:17:43] <majindusto> It honestly Isn't
[1:17:43] <%kewlmyc> Every boss fight is just the Charger from L4D2
[1:17:43] <peachy996> Your mind hasn't expanded yet
[1:17:46] <+SolidusRex> These boss fights were ALWAYS bad
[1:17:48] <$doomerskeletor13> Listen, Rocksteady wasn‚Äôt a big studio yet LUL
[1:17:49] <Skul1b3ard> There is one decent boss fight in this game fortunately
[1:17:52] <leith_aziz> Thank goodness They're SO MUCH BETTER in later games
[1:17:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> im too dumb to figure this out myself, but god i wish fights with big enemies weren't just "bait into hard object to punch"
[1:17:53] <brian_peppers1> You've experienced way worse Woolie
[1:17:55] <Dio_TR> It's time bois
[1:17:56] <%Dakuu75> who is he talking to? I don't recognize that voice

[1:18:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> It was the era of bad boss fights, that we're still in to some extent
[1:18:11] <+Superbro64> nothing says "batman" like "beat the bad guys like a mulsce man until they are down"
[1:18:12] <Dio_TR> Shrek Time

[1:18:17] <+Story_Ark> "i have some of her pheromones, sniff sniff"
[1:18:18] <leith_aziz> @darkfilled Nah, not in City and Origins
[1:18:18] <ulcaban> 'I saved her bathwater'
[1:18:19] <DeadlyWest> yeah nah, a lot of flaws in this game kinda got overlooked on release because when it came out the immediate reaction was "HOLY FUCK THEY MADE A GOOD BATMAN GAME"
[1:18:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Batman sniffs out the plant baps
[1:18:20] <Asuterisuku> Bruce with that Poison Ivy Bathwater.
[1:18:22] <%psidefx> Big Stink

[1:26:07] <deviljhojho_> nice

[1:26:10] <%agoaj> Woolie got some flow going
[1:26:12] <+samuraiknack> Dude died of hypothermia
[1:26:14] <Skul1b3ard> Use the Batman Button Woolie!
[1:26:17] <+Story_Ark> remember you can use ground takedowns too in a combo
[1:26:21] <Ashenik1> I just prefer swimming in combos rather than do the finisher
[1:26:22] <Arancet> good job on this fight, now you're getting it
[1:26:23] <%X2Eliah> Bottomless abyss would be less cruel than a water hole with walls you cannot climb out of... Swim until youre too tired, then drown.
[1:26:23] <brachydios777> Nice
[1:26:24] <%orcstr16> Woolie is starting to get into it.
[1:26:24] <%cubbywolf> needs more appendage breaking
[1:26:26] <Skul1b3ard> If you're uncertain over whether to counter or not just Batman
[1:26:27] <@Solidus_113> correct
[1:26:28] <BurdRightsActivist> didn't kill btw, just a steel pipe to the head. Nothing drastic
[1:26:28] <Dio_TR> YELLOW
[1:26:29] <masterfire23> yeah it's orange
[1:26:30] <wujak> when the counter is yellow
[1:26:30] <Skul1b3ard> it won't break the counter
[1:26:32] <dundore77> when the combo turns orange
[1:26:32] <SunsetJack> It highlights back.
[1:26:34] <@Solidus_113> no more tutorials
[1:26:37] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus When the combo counter glows yellow, hit B+Y
[1:26:38] <DeadlyWest> @samuraiknack If the fall itself didn't kill him. That was a big height
[1:26:38] <%cubbywolf> just batman to solve problems
[1:26:40] <peachy996> No once it hits orange you get access
[1:26:41] <+Story_Ark> you can get it up to 40+ if you get super good at it
[1:26:41] <TheWizardOfWordplay> once your at gold number
[1:26:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:42] <+DomunDomunDomun> If the combo's orange you can do the moves, basically.
[1:26:42] <Asuterisuku> Any time the combo counter is yellow, you can do them.
[1:26:44] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus The number changes to yellow when you can do it
[1:26:44] <+Mkingston> @X2Eliah Plague Dogs style
[1:26:45] <Jaysky> @Story_Ark It's risky though cause of the small radius and you can just end your combo
[1:26:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> man I NEED to see a batman kiryu teamup
[1:26:47] <darkfilled> ip man combos are great to end with imo
[1:26:48] <%itschickenscratch> when the combo counter turns yellow you can do it
[1:26:51] <+chosenjuan42> yeah the combo changes color when you can do it
[1:26:51] <+condemned_15> leave
[1:26:55] <mar_krow> The special take down our great
[1:26:55] <NoireRequiem> ruined my pasta with too much oil :-(
[1:27:05] <+Ricky_Rexx> yeah thats the spot
[1:27:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Shadow of Mordor is basically this but better, with decapitations and ghost powers instead of gadgets
[1:27:15] <+condemned_15> yes go there
[1:27:23] <NoireRequiem> batman with heat moves
[1:27:27] <Darren716> Gotta talk to Cash first
[1:27:29] <RWLJr98> Time for the goofiest boss in the game?
[1:27:36] <RWLJr98> The REAL goofiest
[1:27:36] <Jaysky> @fruit_pie_the_magician Not a better story, or characters. Gameplay sure.
[1:27:37] <+Superbro64> Im pretty sure anyone who was suddenly pulled down from a height to a body of water would immediately panic and drown
[1:27:37] <%cubbywolf> ?
[1:27:40] <+Mkingston> @fruit_pie_the_magician could not get into that game
[1:27:41] <DeadlyWest> @NoireRequiem I mean the special takedowns essentially are heat moves
[1:27:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Shortcuts
[1:27:45] <dabeaminator> Does this count as a boss fight? If so it's the only good one.
[1:27:49] <deviljhojho_> i found that out during a stealth section
[1:27:50] <thelivingglitch307> NOT death
[1:27:54] <deviljhojho_> it was wacky
[1:27:58] <leith_aziz> @fruit_pie_the_magician I find the world building way less interesting though. They have different strenghts
[1:27:59] <SheefEatsBeef> ok but like. how is he gonna get up. he's dead
[1:28:01] <NoireRequiem> @DeadlyWest but we need the cinematic auras!
[1:28:01] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you can spam quick fire and get more
[1:28:03] <%cubbywolf> how can he just leave them like that
[1:28:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The story and characters are ass, but the game itself is fun as shit
[1:28:05] <thelivingglitch307> it works on rails too
[1:28:05] <deviljhojho_> diddle what now
[1:28:09] <rytisone> shut up Flanders

[1:37:00] <+Undenizen> yeah no they just go to that location
[1:37:01] <+Javaa01> Collars attract attention, not cause an immediate alert
[1:37:02] <+Story_Ark> it was just for that one sequence where they had hostages
[1:37:02] <+skyheys> yeah game is inconsistent
[1:37:03] <@Commando_Joe> @VidulaSaix It's not that people are bothered, it's just writing that people are pointing out
[1:37:03] <NoireRequiem> nope let noone see you is all
[1:37:04] <%ColonelTyphoon> the only reason it was a game over last time was because of hostages
[1:37:06] <Ashenik1> @VidulaSaix but like: RUDE
[1:37:07] <+Ricky_Rexx> It only matters if there are hostages, otherwise it just alerts everyone else
[1:37:07] <RWLJr98> That was only in that one room
[1:37:12] <@Commando_Joe> Not everything has to piss someone off for them to talk about it @VidulaSaix lol
[1:37:13] <BlackermanZX> no game over because no hostage

[1:37:15] <solracc25> no
[1:37:17] <dabeaminator> Break their bones fairly quickly
[1:37:18] <leith_aziz> Its not game over if thats what your asking
[1:37:18] <Asuterisuku> You CAN, he's just not in the right spot.
[1:37:19] <%cubbywolf> scared that guy good

[1:37:26] <Dio_TR> LUL
[1:37:28] <DedlokPM> it alerts them as in tells the others they were taken down and then they come investigate it
[1:37:38] <+Story_Ark> yeah the game will tell you "i should take out the operator" if necessary otherwise its a normal stealth sequence
[1:37:39] <thelivingglitch307> lame

[1:38:36] <Asuterisuku> You don't get punished for that.
[1:38:37] <NoireRequiem> keep testing
[1:38:38] <%cubbywolf> they all get alerted and you need to divide and conquore
[1:38:39] <CoffeeShopA> nope
[1:38:39] <%agoaj> zero punishment
[1:38:39] <velgaduere> it's not, because they're not a game over state anymore
[1:38:41] <samuelfisk> Joker was right
[1:38:41] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Alert is only a problem if there are hostages, dude
[1:38:42] <brunoberserk> you always confused , you overthinks too much
[1:38:42] <+Ricky_Rexx> not here it just alerts them that it
[1:38:42] <+Story_Ark> no, its just so you dont stay in one location
[1:38:46] <leith_aziz> When someone gets knocked out, the alert will make them check the body. Thats it
[1:38:47] <%cubbywolf> you need to get them all so they get alerted one way or the other
[1:38:47] <Lancaster_H> woolie you're "confused" about shit you haven't even tried once yet @WoolieVersus
[1:38:49] <%NorthGrizzly> I don't why you overthinking it this much
[1:38:49] <darkfilled> smoke pellets
[1:38:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> Only one way to find out
[1:38:51] <dabeaminator> It draws more goons to his body and they're more alert. That's all.
[1:38:52] <DedlokPM> other than they will be on alert, no punishment
[1:38:52] <leith_aziz> You can set it up
[1:38:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> give him a little kiss
[1:38:53] <%Captain_Aham> collar isn't a fail state
[1:38:55] <+skyheys> yup
[1:38:56] <+VidulaSaix> It's not like a roomwide alert of where you are Woolie. you're overthinking it way too hard
[1:38:58] <+Story_Ark> its just so you dont stick around
[1:38:59] <+GenesisKnight> It only matters when there's hostages
[1:39:00] <brachydios777> The collar will attract them to the body not alert them
[1:39:04] <thelivingglitch307> give it a moment
[1:39:04] <RWLJr98> They just get alerted to that location. Maybe spray some explosive gel @woolieversus
[1:39:05] <leith_aziz> I wouldnt say nothing
[1:39:08] <leith_aziz> Yes
[1:39:09] <Asuterisuku> But also he wasn't wearing one.
[1:39:10] <SainEdge> the collar is just there so you have to move after a takedown
[1:39:11] <Doctadaking> Woolie, the collars just tell enemies where their fallen comrades are
[1:39:12] <Ashenik1> yep
[1:39:12] <+Story_Ark> yeah
[1:39:15] <%wibbwobbler> yes, there is no fail state in this situation
[1:39:21] <%cubbywolf> now get the lone guy moving to the group
[1:39:23] <+condemned_15> collar alerts your posittion. just go somewhere else
[1:39:24] <%cubbywolf> too late
[1:39:24] <+chosenjuan42> yup
[1:39:28] <MrArkannoyed> It's not Metal Gear. "Alerts" aren't a problem
[1:39:30] <%X2Eliah> @wibbwobbler Well death is a fail state
[1:39:37] <DedlokPM> @brachydios777 they will start their "alert" patrolling. So yes. they will be alerted.

[1:41:16] <mothmanandthesalmon> Metal Gear playthrough when?
[1:41:21] <+Story_Ark> woolz you can grate takedown as well. also you CAN takedown from a glide kick just takes a second
[1:41:22] <+skyheys> turn detective mode off once you know where dudes are,
[1:41:25] <T_Sasquatch> Its literally not that difficult :(
[1:41:26] <Skul1b3ard> I would love to see Woolie Vs. Hitman
[1:41:30] <rlayers> use claw!
[1:41:31] <+taggerung403> Has Woolie played Deus Ex Human Revolution?
[1:41:31] <+Story_Ark> good idea!
[1:41:32] <%X2Eliah> Man Reggie had less difficulties with Demon Souls
[1:41:38] <HolyGriddles> @woolieversus you can quickly tap the left trigger to toss a batarang to someone shooting you so you can escape
[1:41:39] <%agoaj> Nice idea but I don't think it's at the ladder
[1:41:43] <leith_aziz> Actually, an MGS stream aint a bad idea
[1:41:45] <Lancaster_H> woolies inability to understand mechanics consistently baffle me considering his videogame history
[1:41:49] <BurdRightsActivist> @taggerung403 pretty sure he playtested it
[1:42:01] <+skyheys> @lancaster_h be nice, hes distracted
[1:42:02] <+condemned_15> stay there!
[1:42:02] <rlayers> use the batclaw
[1:42:03] <Asuterisuku> The grates are your friend.
[1:42:07] <Laironx3> placing explosive gel where an enemy is knocked down is also a good tactic
[1:42:09] <BlackermanZX> you can knock enemies with the gel too
[1:42:10] <Asuterisuku> Clever.

[1:42:51] <%cubbywolf> hit the rope with a batarang
[1:42:52] <peachy996> You can really see the use of the gadgets that would come later in City, like the Smokebomb
[1:42:54] <sunnythedrunk> glide kicks are usually good for the last 2 guys
[1:42:57] <anAngryHamster> cut the rope
[1:42:58] <+condemned_15> cut the guy down
[1:42:59] <+Story_Ark> get the guy on top woolz hes alone!
[1:43:00] <BlackermanZX> cut the rope
[1:43:04] <%cubbywolf> gut the guy down and use it again

[1:43:13] <+Story_Ark> glide kick and then ground takedown
[1:43:21] <%emptyantics> @dante_namikaze1 You‚Äôre right Woolie is DSP3

[1:43:26] <%cubbywolf> its okay, that unconscious goon who landed head first is fine
[1:43:26] <Skul1b3ard> DSP is an awful person though where as Woolie is a legend, let him play his Batman in peace.

[1:46:59] <Asuterisuku> They're all picked up in order regardless of where you find them.
[1:46:59] <%saladin1911> ribbit
[1:46:59] <Dio_TR> Someone get the youtube video ready for woolie at the end of the game LUL
[1:47:01] <+Mordexai0> Some interpretations of Poison Ivy she's naked so they have to cover her up
[1:47:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ilike_femboys i like your name Kappa
[1:47:02] <dundore77> i think they go in order no matter what order you find them
[1:47:02] <+DomunDomunDomun> It unlocks them in order regardless of which ones you get
[1:47:02] <%itschickenscratch> you get them in order no matter where you find them
[1:47:03] <sunnythedrunk> They are a worthy offstream task
[1:47:04] <peachy996> You won't find out, we'll probably tell you at the end of the LP or you look for them all afterwards
[1:47:05] <+Reaverund> I think they just unlock sequentially no matter what
[1:47:08] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus you could also watch it on youtube
[1:47:09] <+Story_Ark> OH SHIT RIBBIT?! IS IT FROG MAN?@
[1:47:10] <%cubbywolf> I always thought, Ivy was just laughing and it was echoing throughout the building
[1:47:11] <cosmicgoatee> woolie, you can just watch a video on the collectibles
[1:47:12] <HorribleHog> i mean the lore is good but just look at the video after
[1:47:12] <+Javaa01> You get the audio tapes in a linear order even if you pick them up completely back-to-front

[1:52:00] <+ja07sj> it's some really smart stuff, Bioshock did that too
[1:52:01] <DedlokPM> @Skul1b3ard If Batman punches it it will just be like when Zepelli punched that one frog
[1:52:03] <+Javaa01> Floor is lava btw

[1:52:07] <+condemned_15> line launcher
[1:52:07] <arcade0416> ivy gas is just joker gas but instead of making you laugh it makes you get really sad about global warming for a few hours
[1:52:07] <%X2Eliah> LINE
[1:52:08] <+Ricky_Rexx> There's no good explanation for why batman can't wall run
[1:52:09] <glass_marcus> Skyward Sword
[1:52:15] <%agoaj> Is this the area that was impossible to pass in the pirated version?
[1:52:16] <%X2Eliah> Every time?
[1:52:20] <%X2Eliah> Every time
[1:52:20] <+chosenjuan42> only if you got a new gadget
[1:52:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> easy peasy
[1:52:25] <NoireRequiem> noice
[1:52:28] <leith_aziz> @agoaj That was in like the first hour
[1:52:35] <%saladin1911> @tardispardis No, Yakuza games done even make changes LUL I've fucked that one office up like 100 times by now lmao
[1:52:35] <iLike_femboys> there3 is another on top of cash btw
[1:52:43] <Asuterisuku> Now to find the path.
[1:52:51] <cosmicgoatee> the Metroid collectible aspect of this game is what sold me
[1:52:52] <rlayers> why?
[1:52:53] <darkfilled> true, if the prince of persia can wall run then so can batman.
[1:52:54] <%akuda_bar> LUL
[1:52:55] <+Ricky_Rexx> don'
[1:52:58] <+Ricky_Rexx> t huff that
[1:52:58] <+Javaa01> Yeah those dudes are dead
[1:52:58] <%X2Eliah> GAAAS
[1:52:58] <RWLJr98> Rigt
[1:53:01] <BlackermanZX> ivy stank
[1:53:04] <+skyheys> horny gas
[1:53:05] <NoireRequiem> choke
[1:53:06] <+Superbro64> man, its almost like this game is a metroidvania or something :O
[1:53:09] <RamenRiderZ> GYAS
[1:53:10] <rytisone> love chemicals
[1:53:11] <+Ricky_Rexx> very pungent my dear
[1:53:13] <%X2Eliah> It's wild how Batman does not have a gasmask in his super-suit
[1:53:21] <dabeaminator> Batman can barely turn his head in that suit, I think wallrunning would be a little tough.
[1:53:23] <jorniev> WOOLIE VS CHEMICALS
[1:53:29] <Skul1b3ard> Fling a batarang forward then jump off it like in Mario Oddessy
[1:53:29] <Asuterisuku> "Okay"
[1:53:35] <anAngryHamster> FEED ME
[1:53:41] <+Ricky_Rexx> Seymour!
[1:53:44] <Asuterisuku> Might want to take a closer look, Woolie.
[1:53:49] <jorniev> SHIMMY?
[1:53:57] <peachy996> @X2Eliah Reminds me of the time Joker asks why Batman leaves his mouth open and he replies "To Mock you"
[1:54:02] <arcade0416> the gas is low to the ground, the stairs are just above it
[1:54:02] <Skul1b3ard> Shimmy Shimmy Ya
[1:54:07] <peachy996> And its like
[1:54:09] <wanderingdain90> it makes zero sense why Batman doesn't always wear a mask that can cover his nose and mouth
[1:54:11] <arcade0416> ivy gas is dense af
[1:54:11] <+skyheys> big horny
[1:54:12] <Asuterisuku> Those guys are above the gas.
[1:54:14] <+DomunDomunDomun> They're just above it.
[1:54:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> Gas can't climb stairs
[1:54:15] <peachy996> No but seriously why
[1:54:19] <rlayers> jump!
[1:54:20] <Chatterbox1991> just jump down
[1:54:21] <+Ricky_Rexx> fact
[1:54:22] <+Javaa01> Just glide over to them
[1:54:23] <iLike_femboys> just glide
[1:54:24] <Dio_TR> Cops are already toxic enough, that shit ain't doing nuthing to them Kappa
[1:54:24] <sunnythedrunk> Those guys are tier 3'd so they have immunity
[1:54:25] <NoireRequiem> @Skul1b3ard i thought of ODB and SOAD
[1:54:25] <slix3431> So many farts in Arkham
[1:54:25] <%akuda_bar> gas is like daleks, it cant go upstairs
[1:54:26] <+SolidusRex> Just go down
[1:54:29] <RWLJr98> They aren‚Äôt in poison
[1:54:29] <+Ricky_Rexx> you can it's good
[1:54:30] <+chiazam> Gas sinks to the floor
[1:54:31] <rlayers> jump XD
[1:54:32] <RamenRiderZ> Protected by $15/H
[1:54:33] <+el_hearto> @wanderingdain90 At some point you have to sacrifice practicality for design.
[1:54:33] <%MrKerb> JUmp down
[1:54:35] <balthazar758> woolieee
[1:54:36] <leith_aziz> @wanderingdain90 Might not look frightening is my only explanation
[1:54:38] <iLike_femboys> EZ
[1:54:39] <darkfilled> see? in this game, gas does not rise woolie.
[1:54:41] <+SolidusRex> THERE IS NO LAVA
[1:54:41] <+el_hearto> in comic books at least
[1:54:43] <Skul1b3ard> @NoireRequiem Either is a solid reference
[1:54:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:48] <dundore77> it makes no sense batman doesn't carry a gasmask at all times how many people does he face use gas
[1:54:49] <brachydios777> @akuda_bar Until it can
[1:54:49] <+FuqBoiSlim> Batman microdosed poisons during his bat training so he's immune to every poison - This probably happened idk
[1:54:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> The floor is braps
[1:54:52] <%aram909> its not gas its spores
[1:54:52] <AstrodropGaming> The floor is Fartgas
[1:54:53] <DSD24> What do you think?
[1:54:56] <leith_aziz> ONE sentence, Batman
[1:54:58] <%jmpeil> Reggie is a fucking hero
[1:54:59] <%X2Eliah> WRINKLEFACE
[1:55:00] <Skul1b3ard> Wow

[1:55:02] <puluxor> No, The Mad Hatter
[1:55:04] <Skul1b3ard> Good guess Cash!
[1:55:05] <%NorthGrizzly> not so complex
[1:55:06] <%emptyantics> @dundore77 For real
[1:55:07] <+MikeNmurdoc> LUL this guys face
[1:55:07] <+samuraiknack> Stairs the natural enemy of the gas
[1:55:09] <BlackermanZX> a big butt
[1:55:09] <+skyheys> his face is weird
[1:55:10] <arcade0416> oh shit i'm realizing we're almost at my favorite part of the game! no spoilers of course but i'm mad excited for The Next Building They Go Into
[1:55:10] <+ja07sj> always a butt

[1:55:19] <Dio_TR> CROC TIME
[1:55:20] <+taggerung403> Crocs a human too :(
[1:55:21] <Dio_TR> hell yeah
[1:55:24] <iLike_femboys> they changed mad hatter for ivy
[1:55:24] <+Ricky_Rexx> We keep the deformed human in the sewer like a literal animal
[1:55:27] <dekkitout> In this case, it's Ivy's ass- oh you don't mean that kind of "butt"
[1:55:27] <darkfilled> if air is considered a gas, then spores are gas too tho.
[1:55:28] <%X2Eliah> @Huntercd sure is
[1:55:29] <thelivingglitch307> Croc time monkaS
[1:55:33] <%akuda_bar> Cash Jackson
[1:55:35] <leith_aziz> What kinda security is that ?
[1:55:37] <DSD24> Little hard to do that Batman
[1:55:42] <arcade0416> she's being framed
[1:55:44] <DSD24> There's plants right next to us
[1:55:46] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus Beetle thing on top of cash
[1:55:46] <%PapaGravestone> WTF Thats inhumane WutFace
[1:55:46] <+zayahb> How many times we feeding the Croc?
[1:55:47] <+taggerung403> It was Swamp Thing Kappa
[1:55:48] <+heyitsdenzel_> the plants belong to the riddler
[1:55:49] <%Afterman_> goddamn
[1:55:50] <leith_aziz> "Lets just leave him there in the sewers"
[1:55:51] <+Ricky_Rexx> and no insurance
[1:55:51] <BlackermanZX> maybe it was the killer moth StinkyGlitch
[1:55:54] <AvroEltz> Giant plants, the calling card of the RIDDLER
[1:55:55] <Darren716> I'm sure Cash is making a solid 18
[1:55:56] <%Afterman_> 15 an hour to get ur arm eaten by a man croc
[1:55:58] <RWLJr98> Nah it‚Äôs red hood
[1:55:58] <+chosenjuan42> It's swamp thing
[1:56:00] <%orcstr16> They don't get paid enough to guess like that.
[1:56:00] <+xiccy> To be fair, it's against her will
[1:56:01] <RamenRiderZ> This must be a work of the PENGUIN
[1:56:01] <Skul1b3ard> All these monstrous plants growing everywhere? This has got to be the work of that damned Penguin
[1:56:04] <iLike_femboys> Killer moth deserves love
[1:56:07] <+skyheys> yep
[1:56:10] <sporeian94> Back to the beginning of the game
[1:56:12] <+Ricky_Rexx> it's plantismo
[1:56:12] <+Aresius_> Nah, it was Calendar Man Kappa
[1:56:13] <eldragon_1> Clearly Condiment King
[1:56:15] <TheWizardOfWordplay> technically this is in the 90s so that's pretty good
[1:56:17] <+skyheys> ASSETS
[1:56:17] <%jmpeil> Did Woolie end up getting demonetized on YouTube for the last vod?
[1:56:19] <SixthShinx> Just literally had to go here to get info
[1:56:20] <+chiazam> OKAY They can't ALLLL be making $15 an hour
[1:56:20] <Skul1b3ard> @RamenRiderZ great minds
[1:56:25] <leith_aziz> This must be the work of an enemy stand !
[1:56:29] <arcade0416> no but think about how smart a scheme it would be to commit crimes while using other villain's aesthetic to deflect suspicion. like steal a diamond and just leave fake joker cards and bad riddles all over
[1:56:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> Dr Doom must be behind this
[1:56:36] <EcchiMichael> Dude couldn't call over a radio
[1:56:39] <+Superbro64> @jmpeil game audio makes the entire lp un-monetizable
[1:56:39] <+SolidusRex> It's gotta be the work of Clock King
[1:56:44] <%orcstr16> @chiazam You're right. Some of them are making 9.
[1:56:46] <dabeaminator> This is the work of Gold Experience
[1:56:47] <Asuterisuku> Can't really go back through this place right now.
[1:56:49] <%X2Eliah> He literally could have shouted across the room
[1:56:50] <DSD24> @arcade0416 That does actually sound pretty rad
[1:56:51] <+AWKWARDL0SER> IRL most Prison guards make around minimum wage hence prison bribery
[1:56:56] <BlackermanZX> Whens Humpty Dumpty tho. Batman's greatest enemy
[1:56:58] <slix3431> MEAT
[1:57:01] <RWLJr98> $15
[1:57:07] <sporeian94> Croc is scary as fuck in this game

[1:57:09] <deviljhojho_> crikScheme sure
[1:57:10] <Darren716> Kappa
[1:57:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> Croc fight is the only good boss in this game besides scarecrow parts
[1:57:11] <Dio_TR> yeah sure
[1:57:11] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[1:57:13] <thelivingglitch307> fresh meat
[1:57:14] <Asuterisuku> Croc's is genuinely better.

[1:57:19] <+Superbro64> Kappa
[1:57:21] <arcade0416> @DSD24 villains in gotham are way too addicted to their personal brand, it makes them really easy to rip off in theory lol

[1:57:27] <+Undenizen> oh man Woolies, I hope you're ready for disappointment!
[1:57:28] <Enyoyable> You're too low
[1:57:29] <peachy996> Croc is better because it's not a boss fight
[1:57:29] <+Ricky_Rexx> Honey, you got a big storm coming
[1:57:29] <crocboyz> aleast 900 times min
[1:57:30] <BurdRightsActivist> 4U
[1:57:31] <iLike_femboys> Croc part is nerve wrecking
[1:57:33] <RWLJr98> Kappa
[1:57:41] <+skyheys> oh man, if it was just three...
[1:57:41] <deafmelone> I‚Äôve been waiting for this
[1:57:42] <%emptyantics> Croc part is actually spooky
[1:57:43] <%ZeeJiggle> They won't expect 2 of them AGAIN.
[1:57:43] <Lancaster_H> 3 AND adds
[1:57:47] <%RyTYoung> Just you wait Kappa
[1:57:49] <+MikeNmurdoc> That cape damage made me poggers back in the day
[1:57:50] <+el_hearto> hey uh chat be quiet
[1:57:50] <arcade0416> i think croc fight has the most custom death animations in the game, right?
[1:57:52] <+Superbro64> 2008 was a different time :(
[1:57:56] <peachy996> The pseudo bosses are better than actual bosses in this
[1:58:01] <leith_aziz> I think the Croc part is a genuine treat
[1:58:09] <+chosenjuan42> 3 & tiny knife
[1:58:10] <AvroEltz> What if it is the same enemy BUT RED
[1:58:14] <+Superbro64> I miss 2008 youtubes star rating system :(
[1:58:21] <Dio_TR> A problem solving test LUL
[1:58:21] <leith_aziz> It was a batman game in 2008, so I doubt budget was big
[1:58:21] <Asuterisuku> Metroidvanias be like that.
[1:58:26] <DSD24> That sounds fun
[1:58:29] <%X2Eliah> Fun idea: same enemy but upside down
[1:58:34] <arcade0416> realistically i think psuedo-boss stealth encounters will always be a better fit for batman because most of batman's enemies are like...Normal Guys Who Happen To Dress Weird?
[1:58:42] <+condemned_15> it's like the Kamurocho map in Yakuza. Very little new assets but still feels fresh
[1:58:43] <darkfilled> i just don't like how every boss in this is to gimmicky.
[1:58:44] <+ja07sj> PogChamp PALETTE PogChamp SWAPS PogChamp
[1:58:44] <samuelfisk> @peachy996 Like Scarecrow and Croc?
[1:58:46] <%emptyantics> @x2eliah Bloodborne type beat
[1:58:47] <sporeian94> Change lighting, enemy placement, and music
[1:58:49] <Darren716> City squeezes a ton out of it's relatively small sandbox
[1:58:52] <+chosenjuan42> FIST THOSE EXP
[1:58:56] <peachy996> Yeah Scarecrow and Croc are the highlights
[1:59:00] <MinersLoveGames> Croc's section freaked me out so much that I restarted the game to avoid doing it the first time around.
[1:59:01] <Asuterisuku> Recolour one of the sprites and that is now a new boss fight.
[1:59:02] <DSD24> Punch!
[1:59:04] <+skyheys> rad
[1:59:04] <ravowe3000> PixelBob PixelBob PixelBob
[1:59:06] <FirewallStorm> nice
[1:59:07] <cosmicgoatee> i used to think the earlier Assassin's Creed games were metroidvanias, in a wierd sort of way too
[1:59:08] <peachy996> I don't have a problem with the Ivy fight but we'll see
[1:59:21] <%X2Eliah> ivy fight was kinda hard iirc, ngl
[1:59:22] <rlayers> yes
[1:59:23] <rlayers> do it!
[1:59:27] <Asuterisuku> They're wearing security jackets oh no
[1:59:27] <RWLJr98> Make a bet on if woolie will beat Croc first try. He‚Äôs just a harder Bane fight Kappa
[1:59:29] <+condemned_15> LUL
[1:59:32] <leith_aziz> The game is at its best when it embraces its tension and scare-factor
[1:59:33] <Chatterbox1991> spoiler
[1:59:40] <@Solidus_113> there we go
[1:59:40] <Dio_TR> LUL
[1:59:41] <arcade0416> alright i haven't been to the streams in a bit, let's see how much better woolie got at the combat
[1:59:42] <DatAsuna> yeah don't let him hit you
[1:59:42] <Tardispardis> D:
[1:59:43] <leith_aziz> Thats how you end up with Scarecrow and Croc
[1:59:45] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[1:59:45] <samuelfisk> @peachy996 Ivy is a breath of fresh air after all the Titan guys.
[1:59:47] <DatAsuna> idiot
[1:59:47] <TheWizardOfWordplay> now's he got it
[1:59:49] <thelivingglitch307> I never thought to batarang the spores and I played this game multiple times...
[1:59:49] <AstrodropGaming> Straight cripple that man
[1:59:50] <iLike_femboys> he is starting to believe
[1:59:52] <%DashXero> He'll get back up.
[1:59:55] <%DashXero> He's fine.
[1:59:55] <SixthShinx> Popped that kneecap
[1:59:55] <+MikeNmurdoc> Bad batman! Bad!
[1:59:56] <DSD24> Gotta pay those bills
[1:59:57] <DatAsuna> just combo batman
[1:59:57] <T_Sasquatch> @condemned_15 which isn't technically true. Like yakuza adds map updates like the umderground or the rooftop walkways. Hell there's an entire massive parking lot in 5
[1:59:58] <+PapaGravestone> Dont let him hit you 4Head
[1:59:58] <AvroEltz> rolled into the hit woolie, improve your spacing
[1:59:59] <peachy996> @samuelfisk true
[1:59:59] <%saladin1911> Why are they still barefoot?
[2:00:00] <+CoronetChris> He ain't dead tho
[2:00:00] <uncledoodsauce> woolie is still too much of a yakuza player

[2:00:17] <leith_aziz> No checkpoint ?
[2:00:19] <leith_aziz> Damn
[2:00:20] <%X2Eliah> I DID NOT KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE
[2:00:24] <Skul1b3ard> With Batman Button comes great responsibility
[2:00:25] <%jmpeil> Reggie would be the best Robin.
[2:00:33] <arcade0416> this is hard to watch sometimes but i understand, it definitely is a weird combat system to get used to at first, especially in the first game
[2:00:37] <puluxor> Peep inside the garden if you want a checkpoint a little closer
[2:00:39] <Asuterisuku> Reggie, they're still Joker's goons, that's just proof that almost all the guards are dead.
[2:00:47] <+samuraiknack> God imagine Reggie in those Robin shorts

[2:00:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> huh
[2:00:56] <Lancaster_H> perfect
[2:00:56] <Asuterisuku> You CAN batarang the spores, but you have to aim.
[2:01:01] <RWLJr98> Nice
[2:01:02] <Enyoyable> If only there was a stealthy aproache
[2:01:05] <rytisone> the master of timing
[2:01:07] <+PerrinIsDead> what happen
[2:01:08] <T_Sasquatch> @arcade0416 by now he should've gotten the hang of it LUL
[2:01:17] <arcade0416> having joker's goons disguise as arkham guards WOULD be a good idea if they had bothered to take the make-up off
[2:01:17] <Tardispardis> AAAAAA-!
[2:01:20] <%orcstr16> It took me until city to get good at arkham combat, so I understand Woolie's difficulty.
[2:01:22] <dabeaminator> You whiffed a punch
[2:01:27] <%jepupu> Whiff = drop
[2:01:29] <arcade0416> @T_Sasquatch i mean sure maybe but hey at least it's entertaining to watch lol
[2:01:29] <darkfilled> ok chat, what's the best way to deal with the plants?
[2:01:31] <chili_nobeans> every missed punch is drop
[2:01:42] <$LightningLynx89> miss = drop
[2:01:42] <+Javaa01> You punched nothing, therefor it's not a true combo
[2:01:44] <%jepupu> You gotta keep the chain going. Remember to aim your attacks
[2:01:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:01:47] <MinersLoveGames> Christ.
[2:01:47] <+chiazam> why doesn't woolie hit the counter button?
[2:01:48] <Dio_TR> I bet woolie is loving this combat Kappa
[2:01:48] <Darren716> Woolie never don't counter when you see the pop up
[2:01:49] <rlayers> woolie try the bloody palace of this game
[2:01:50] <Asuterisuku> @darkfilled Run in and hit it before it can drop the spore.
[2:01:50] <peachy996> Wait for spore, batarang then run and crush the plant
[2:01:51] <samuelfisk> @darkfilled Approach them slowly.
[2:01:55] <Dante_Namikaze1> every wihff is a drop
[2:01:59] <Tardispardis> Block, punch, it's all in the mind
[2:02:00] <+GenesisKnight> Stop getting hit
[2:02:02] <iLike_femboys> dont let them hit you
[2:02:02] <darkfilled> oh, i see.
[2:02:04] <arcade0416> yeah forget the whole timing idea, just counter whenever you have to counter
[2:02:05] <BlackermanZX> there ya go
[2:02:06] <rlayers> woolie go for the bloody palace challenge when u have time
[2:02:07] <+ja07sj> he's being more active now
[2:02:11] <leith_aziz> @ravowe3000 Witcher 3, Yakuza 0/7, Persona 5, DMC 5 and Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 if it had rollback
[2:02:12] <RWLJr98> It‚Äôs stupid easy when you get used to it
[2:02:13] <X2Eliah> wowza
[2:02:14] <Doctadaking> Once you get a combo of 3 or more, every hit knocks enemies down
[2:02:15] <sunnythedrunk> Kill the electric guys first
[2:02:15] <dundore77> you also can't "walk" or it drops the combo
[2:02:16] <$LightningLynx89> Woolie'sgetting it
[2:02:17] <jtsoppy137> is he ok Kappa
[2:02:18] <thelivingglitch307> zap
[2:02:19] <invalid_robin> You can cancel punches with counters if I recall?
[2:02:19] <jorniev> i have the same reaction time as woolie it seems
[2:02:20] <dabeaminator> Why isn't he using specials? Does he think he needs a prompt or something?
[2:02:20] <brunoberserk> boy
[2:02:22] <slix3431> We need to lab woolie
[2:02:24] <%orcstr16> Don't forget your claw gadget. You can use it to pull people out of the group to pick people off.
[2:02:24] <peachy996> Woolie, Remember Takedowns
[2:02:24] <+Zanzibar_Junker> HHHWUUUHH
[2:02:26] <@Solidus_113> counters cancel attacks don't they???
[2:02:27] <sunnythedrunk> Always kill the specials first
[2:02:28] <T_Sasquatch> I'm so confused what his issue is. I wish i could see his button inputs
[2:02:28] <%jmpeil> We really need a Nuns style opening for this LP
[2:02:30] <brachydios777> Doing better
[2:02:32] <+Zanzibar_Junker> hhhwuuhh
[2:02:33] <arcade0416> i think too many people said "oh it's like a rhythm game" and gave him the whole wrong idea, really the ONLY rule is just counter when you need to counter
[2:02:36] <rytisone> try sneaking up on plants
[2:02:38] <+ja07sj> he just needs to go a bit faster
[2:02:40] <iLike_femboys> adumF
[2:02:40] <CastellanVon> Woolie will figure it out
[2:02:42] <T_Sasquatch> @solidus_113 Y. E S
[2:02:42] <Dio_TR> with the x x x and the y y y
[2:02:45] <Depthcharge2030> its about those style points thought
[2:02:46] <Lancaster_H> reminder that this man promotes fighting games for a living
[2:02:49] <RWLJr98> Woolie is underestimating Arkham
[2:02:51] <+chosenjuan42> Or combo to use free takedowns
[2:02:53] <slix3431> We need to lab this game for woolie
[2:02:54] <Shardlab> you gotta use the cape on whoever has the taser first
[2:02:55] <NoireRequiem> Woolie will figure it out
[2:02:58] <They_Call_Me_The_Fizz> Does Woolie not know how to do the charged takedowns?
[2:02:58] <+skyheys> @lancaster_h why you being like this
[2:02:59] <alexyaoilover> How did he work in QA
[2:03:01] <@Solidus_113> Are you hitting Y every time you see the bat sense? @WoolieVersus it should work 100% of the time
[2:03:01] <ShortAssRibs> Ewww
[2:03:02] <Asuterisuku> Clean
[2:03:06] <leith_aziz> Guys, dont expect Woolie to just be an expert in his FIRST playthrough. We all learn in different paces
[2:03:06] <iLike_femboys> everytime you button smash jason gets hit by a crowbar
[2:03:07] <huskarl_zap> kerpow
[2:03:08] <Tardispardis> Woolie should train in the challenge rooms, those made me git gud with the combat
[2:03:09] <%NorthGrizzly> I never seen anyone have this problem with the combat
[2:03:12] <Skul1b3ard> Yeah counters cancel attacks, double tapping is sometimes useful as you can counter two at once and the Batman Button is great and you should use it a bit more liberally
[2:03:13] <%agoaj> Counters do not cancel attacks, if you start a big spin kick you're stuck in the anim, they fixed it in city.
[2:03:15] <dundore77> you just mash attack and hit triangle counter will cancel your punches overthinking it
[2:03:15] <+Jiggisnipe> @Lancaster_H you seem salty
[2:03:16] <%orcstr16> @They_Call_Me_The_Fizz Not yet actually.
[2:03:17] <Asuterisuku> Y+B bypasses the defenses on guys with knives and batons.
[2:03:19] <Darren716> So speaking of bad boss fights in Arkham games. I'm currently playing Knight for the first time. Fuck the Batmobile bosses
[2:03:20] <Skul1b3ard> But it's still a blast to watch Woolie!
[2:03:23] <jorniev> i have had the same problem with the combat
[2:03:24] <thelivingglitch307> combo batarng is your friend
[2:03:25] <NoireRequiem> @Tardispardis and they are straight up fun
[2:03:27] <darkfilled> i forget if freeflow focus is in this one or not. that would help the woolie tho.
[2:03:28] <+el_hearto> I don't blame Woolie for not getting it.
[2:03:35] <balthazar758> 3d positioning and reflexes outside of his field
[2:03:38] <Lancaster_H> im just poking fun guys, chill
[2:03:42] <wanderingdain90> it even sounds like what I would imagine fisting would sound like
[2:03:42] <NoireRequiem> cookin
[2:03:42] <Skul1b3ard> @Darren716 Yeah Batmobile killed that game in general for me
[2:03:42] <dabeaminator> I think people were describing the perfect-blow mechanic as a rhythm game, and Woolie thought they were talking about the entire combat system.
[2:03:45] <%PapaGravestone> He's Learning PogChamp
[2:03:47] <+skyheys> @el_hearto yeah, the game conveys ideas poorly
[2:03:48] <arcade0416> he's learning!!!!
[2:03:49] <+el_hearto> he's doing it rbzP
[2:03:52] <mikesapartment> he's doing it!
[2:03:52] <Dio_TR> FINALLY
[2:03:53] <+Aresius_> It's a balance of evading and baiting the counter
[2:03:54] <dabeaminator> Yes
[2:03:54] <NoireRequiem> Nope
[2:03:55] <leith_aziz> I will say, not being able to cancel your attacks is annoying since you dont know what type of attack you'll get. Its random
[2:03:57] <leith_aziz> No
[2:03:57] <RamenRiderZ> Aww
[2:03:58] <T_Sasquatch> Ohhhh shit

[2:04:10] <%orcstr16> He's getting it baby
[2:04:10] <peachy996> You only get iframes on the takedown animations
[2:04:12] <Asuterisuku> Y+B has i frames, ground takedown on the other hand does not.
[2:04:12] <brunoberserk> nice
[2:04:12] <T_Sasquatch> Almost a 20 hit combooooooo

[2:04:17] <%PapaGravestone> BibleThump Oh
[2:04:18] <BlackermanZX> yup
[2:04:19] <dabeaminator> Not on startup, but during the animation you have invuln.
[2:04:19] <EcchiMichael> Mashing is so much better

[2:04:27] <slix3431> Combat!
[2:04:27] <%X2Eliah> That's the trick
[2:04:29] <+Reaverund> That's literally what you're supposed to do
[2:04:29] <arcade0416> literally how you're meant to play the game
[2:04:29] <+GenesisKnight> Mashman LUL
[2:04:29] <$LightningLynx89> HE SOLVED IT
[2:04:29] <%bearwagon> yeyeyeyeye
[2:04:29] <mr_red117> thats how you do it
[2:04:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah that's...pretty much it
[2:04:31] <BlackermanZX> Thats literally it
[2:04:32] <Shardlab> Sometimes that's how it goes
[2:04:32] <AstrodropGaming> He figured it out!
[2:04:33] <peachy996> There you go
[2:04:33] <%jmpeil> YEYEYE preptime
[2:04:33] <T_Sasquatch> THAT'S EXACTLY ITTTTT
[2:04:34] <anarchistPastry> just stop thinking, youre batman
[2:04:34] <%orcstr16> I mean. It does work.
[2:04:36] <LunarRemix> Not to be a jerk but the game's designed for 'simple' people, it's really simple
[2:04:36] <jorniev> XXXXXXXXXXXX Y XXXXXXXXXX
[2:04:36] <+jmstwn> No cape wave in this one?
[2:04:36] <+RiverKing13> Woolie playing that Eddie Gordo
[2:04:38] <RWLJr98> That‚Äôs the combat system Woolie
[2:04:38] <Asuterisuku> Just slow your mash to get those Critical Hit bonuses.
[2:04:39] <thelivingglitch307> in terms of the presentation of moves I feel like the first Arkham had the most efficient Batman.
[2:04:41] <%CptnCampy61> EXACTLY
[2:04:42] <%wibbwobbler> yep
[2:04:42] <Nosphomet> thats how its done baybee
[2:04:42] <+chiazam> IT JUST WORKS LMAOOOOOO
[2:04:43] <%emptyantics> HE DID IT
[2:04:44] <mothmanandthesalmon> YOU. Did it.
[2:04:44] <sunnythedrunk> I mean it's mashing different buttons
[2:04:45] <+chosenjuan42> Yes that's combat
[2:04:49] <%jepupu> How bout the batplane.
[2:04:49] <BlackermanZX> calling this shit a rythm game is dumb
[2:04:50] <%ColonelTyphoon> punch people and sometimes press Y. That's the technique =
[2:04:50] <@Menitta> You just hit the xxx and the yyy
[2:04:51] <Rubecks> So was Woolie just overthinking all this time? Jebaited
[2:04:52] <Asuterisuku> You can get a special takedown in three hits if you're doing it right.
[2:04:52] <zepelinnn1> you do not
[2:04:54] <slix3431> Woolie feels dirty
[2:04:55] <%Superspider51> no I frames unless it's a counter
[2:04:58] <+chosenjuan42> Yes
[2:04:59] <%shad8snake> nop
[2:04:59] <RamenRiderZ> Unlearn Devil May Cry
[2:05:02] <+DoktorZee> yoink!
[2:05:02] <+ja07sj> depends on the finisher
[2:05:03] <+Superbro64> comBat LUL
[2:05:03] <kamenspidey> basically a rhythm game except you mash
[2:05:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> In the Mordor games you get multiple combo counts for each hit if you don't mash
[2:05:04] <brunoberserk> if works for you man , thats ok
[2:05:05] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @Rubecks probably
[2:05:07] <+skyheys> TheIlluminati
[2:05:09] <dabeaminator> Not on startup, but yes during the animation
[2:05:10] <+Jiggisnipe> KappaHD
[2:05:12] <NoireRequiem> if someone is about to punch you and you do a finisher you will get punched
[2:05:13] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Ground finishers can be interrupted by enemy attacks, combo finishers stop enemies from attacking you while it's happening
[2:05:15] <+Birdro> combo takedowns are invincible, grounded finishers are not.
[2:05:16] <RWLJr98> This is a line launcher problem
[2:05:17] <Tardispardis> Traingle + circle takedown has i-frames
[2:05:17] <crocboyz> i wont tell
[2:05:17] <T_Sasquatch> The combat is literally laughed at for being overpowered and easy
[2:05:17] <Asuterisuku> A+X and Y+B are uninterruptible.
[2:05:18] <%invader_rin> Chat
[2:05:18] <%Rafoki> yeah the only time you need to think is mixing in variation bonuses
[2:05:18] <zepelinnn1> guys, the knockdown finisher does not have iframes

[2:05:26] <%jmpeil> Batman has joined the Royal Guard
[2:05:26] <AstrodropGaming> Good work chat
[2:05:28] <+skyheys> MrDestructoid
[2:05:28] <%Superspider51> you get no I frames unless it's a counter
[2:05:30] <%agoaj> combo takedowns will make other goons stop attacking, but titans can still hit you.
[2:05:32] <balthazar758> yes and no
[2:05:32] <LVL1_Scumbag> What? You expected consistency?
[2:05:38] <balthazar758> no and yes
[2:05:38] <NoireRequiem> Chat civil wars never change
[2:05:38] <%DooWopShaBop> FUCK SKUB
[2:05:39] <%agoaj> so basically i frames
[2:05:39] <+chosenjuan42> yes you do for the takedown that uses meter
[2:05:39] <+GTCknight> Chat get your shit straight
[2:05:40] <%Superspider51> or a special take down
[2:05:43] <$LightningLynx89> Reggie is just genuinely curious, nothing wrong with that
[2:05:45] <+el_hearto> This game doesn't convey it's ideas very well and the AWFUL advice about it being a "rhythm" game didn't help
[2:05:47] <+chiazam> Ground takedowns are not invulnerable
[2:05:48] <arcade0416> goons will NEVER attack you during a B + Y
[2:05:51] <DedlokPM> psa3guy
[2:05:51] <Lancaster_H> ground finisher doesnt, every other counter and combo takedown does
[2:05:55] <%shad8snake> its complicated
[2:05:56] <NoireRequiem> LUL
[2:05:56] <ShortAssRibs> Voice actor reminds me of TellTale games for some reason
[2:05:57] <thelivingglitch307> oh...
[2:05:58] <Dio_TR> LUL
[2:05:58] <Asuterisuku> Sniped
[2:05:59] <dundore77> people kept saying rhythm and that messes him up. theres no rhythm needed unless you are focusing on the perfect hits. you mash attack and react to the the counter/dodge prompts
[2:06:01] <brachydios777> City helps improve the combat by making it easier to counter during the attack animation
[2:06:04] <%invader_rin> That face
[2:06:05] <RamenRiderZ> THE ENEMY SNIPER...!
[2:06:05] <brunoberserk> LUL LUL LUL
[2:06:07] <thelivingglitch307> mr. quickscope over here
[2:06:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> Good trade
[2:06:08] <dabeaminator> People are unsure if you meant the ground takedowns or the special takedown. That's why you're getting multiple answers.
[2:06:15] <T_Sasquatch> Clappped INSTANTLY
[2:06:20] <%NorthGrizzly> Bat claw is super helpful
[2:06:21] <EcchiMichael> This is just one of those games where chat is ready to pounce.
[2:06:25] <RWLJr98> @woolieversus line launch
[2:06:27] <Asuterisuku> Might need another approach.
[2:06:34] <arcade0416> i honestly think if he just watched like a two minute clip of Batman Arkham Videos doing one of the combat challenges, he'd understand how it works instantly
[2:06:35] <Skul1b3ard> In times like that use the Batman Button
[2:06:37] <+GenesisKnight> Don't worry about combo
[2:06:38] <$LightningLynx89> When in doubt always counter
[2:06:38] <NoireRequiem> Yup gotta judge if they are a threat
[2:06:39] <FrostedZaibatsu> Pull out your bat sniper and kill him
[2:06:40] <+DomunDomunDomun> It's an attack indicator, not a counter prompt.
[2:06:43] <+chiazam> Hit the counter button anyway who cares
[2:06:43] <%jmpeil> There‚Äôs no rhythm. Just punch those fuckers
[2:06:46] <SixthShinx> New bio
[2:06:55] <+chosenjuan42> Ground takendown is not invincible. but combo takedowns are invincible
[2:07:03] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Map should helpn
[2:07:07] <Chatterbox1991> Line Launch from the watchtower?
[2:07:08] <%orcstr16> Just do the xxx and the xxx then the y and the xxx. It works.
[2:07:08] <+MightyDuckShoes> I don't understand. it's just sony spider-man
[2:07:09] <Skul1b3ard> The batman button is good for giving you a moment, like a slight delay or a chance to be able to counter
[2:07:20] <RamenRiderZ> Bat Sniper Repellant, a rocket launcher
[2:07:21] <Skul1b3ard> and I don't believe it breaks the counter at first, only if you keep using it
[2:07:21] <casualshinji> By the time you get to Arkham Knight the combat is so fluid it's actually way too easy.
[2:07:22] <balthazar758> the power of fist
[2:07:22] <SixthShinx> It said Quincy Sharp
[2:07:23] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus nah you got art
[2:07:24] <Asuterisuku> Right next to Joker.
[2:07:25] <jorniev> NO
[2:07:26] <darkfilled> i feel like batman wouldn't care about the spikes.
[2:07:26] <%X2Eliah> sharp?
[2:07:29] <Zantetzuken> character trophy
[2:07:32] <Lancaster_H> you got a trophy

[2:07:40] <$LightningLynx89> Character trophy aka look at their in game model
[2:07:40] <brachydios777> Trophy not bio

[2:07:43] <%NorthGrizzly> It is a Model
[2:07:43] <%alexisofthestars> Is a model, you can see it outside the game
[2:07:44] <+condemned_15> it's just a character model in the etras
[2:07:45] <Asuterisuku> It's a trophy in the main menu.
[2:07:47] <peachy996> Oh yeah Character Model aka a Trophy
[2:07:48] <+discognition> trophy from title screen, not new bio
[2:07:48] <iLike_femboys> you got a trophy

[2:08:54] <brachydios777> Chat chill
[2:08:55] <TheWizardOfWordplay> batclaw doesn't disarm until city
[2:08:55] <peachy996> Eh you'll figure it out
[2:08:55] <Asuterisuku> It's not a BAD idea, but it doesn't really work when he's looking at you.
[2:08:55] <%akuda_bar> this guy's aim is not great

[2:09:23] <+Damie904> Zipline into his bullet?
[2:09:24] <iLike_femboys> is this THE deadshot?
[2:09:34] <arcade0416> @AWKWARDL0SER it DOES, but he has not yet gotten the upgrade for it
[2:09:39] <Asuterisuku> @AWKWARDL0SER It's not as useful as it is in later games.
[2:09:45] <%agoaj> Anti batman spikes are very effective
[2:09:46] <darkfilled> joker gave him the right gun it seems.

[2:10:16] <%akuda_bar> this musical cue is cracking me up, the way it periodically goes "DUNUNUNUN!"
[2:10:18] <+skyheys> This guy is more complicated than Bane
[2:10:26] <HotSauceFiend> my biggest gripe with this game is the non-stop use of detective vision
[2:10:28] <rytisone> if only batman had some sort of plane to fly up there
[2:10:29] <%X2Eliah> Line is the way
[2:10:34] <NoireRequiem> Batman's true rival
[2:10:36] <dabeaminator> You can zipline over to him from certain areas.
[2:10:42] <+zayahb> How could it be?
[2:10:45] <sporeian94> Woolie you're thinking way too hard about this
[2:10:45] <+SolidusRex> Is it bad I never knew until just now you could batarang the spores?
[2:10:47] <%saladin1911> Maybe Sonic Batterang from a distance and then Line Launcher?
[2:10:48] <Doctadaking> You had the right idea. Just batarang him right before line-launching
[2:10:59] <balthazar758> gunman
[2:11:05] <+chiazam> You can totally use the Line Launcher
[2:11:06] <BlackermanZX> i think it was the zip line yeah
[2:11:06] <+taggerung403> I can hear Woolie's brain overclocking trying to solve it
[2:11:09] <NoireRequiem> @zayahb day by day their similarities become too much to bear
[2:11:11] <gunsrlove> So manu of these problems would be solved if Batman had a gun
[2:11:11] <thelivingglitch307> @SolidusRex same
[2:11:14] <RWLJr98> Overthinking it
[2:11:19] <RamenRiderZ> NYAH
[2:11:20] <+chosenjuan42> Does woke have remote batarang?
[2:11:21] <glass_marcus> Just triple jump, hat throw, dive, hat jump, then dive again. it's easy
[2:11:22] <Skul1b3ard> @SolidusRex I only found out about 30 mins ago that you can batarang down the goons you string up
[2:11:22] <masterfire23> nyah
[2:11:24] <Asuterisuku> Woolie keeps directly drawing the sniper's attention.
[2:11:30] <mr_saturday93> woolies really bad at this
[2:11:32] <%akuda_bar> ngahhh~ batman kun..

[2:16:18] <+samuraiknack> Woolie climb to roof of the guard tower and zip line
[2:16:21] <arcade0416> woolie you had the right idea before, you just need to time it for when the sniper isn't looking at you
[2:16:29] <+chosenjuan42> just pay attention to where his laser points at

[2:19:47] <+chiazam> I just looked up the answer for that one
[2:19:51] <T_Sasquatch> Wtf
[2:19:51] <+AWKWARDL0SER> A fall would‚Äôve been really funny

[2:20:00] <NoireRequiem> @RWLJr98 true
[2:20:03] <X2Eliah> @Doctadaking To be fair the game does have a LOT of rough spots
[2:20:10] <%saladin1911> Obviously every single person in chat is a genius who's never been confused by what a game wanted.
[2:20:11] <+mundanelotus> croc let out a fat one
[2:20:11] <+chosenjuan42> Overthink is one of Batman's greatest enemy
[2:20:19] <solracc25> GG sniper footsies
[2:20:24] <+Undenizen> So Arkham has sizemonitors installed around?
[2:20:24] <arcade0416> the game does have rough spots but there's been a LOT of overthinking
[2:20:28] <T_Sasquatch> @saladin1911 I'm perfect
[2:20:31] <BlackermanZX> Damn the later alligator kid is pissed
[2:20:39] <+Jiggisnipe> I bet Woolie's enjoying the game but is annoyed by chat
[2:20:40] <Asuterisuku> Overthinking, Over-analyzing separates the body from the mind
[2:20:40] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @Doctadaking it has a lot of rough spots but woolie is making the rough spots rougher
[2:20:41] <+condemned_15> people have been giving the right strategy

[2:21:24] <NoireRequiem> finish him finish him finish him...
[2:21:25] <cosmicgoatee> time for woolie to git gud
[2:21:26] <dundore77> lets not blow them all up right now but wait til he's here
[2:21:26] <+Ricky_Rexx> Yeah so have fun without the gargoyles
[2:21:30] <%jonblnt> how many attempts will it take?
[2:21:30] <Asuterisuku> You've done this room before, but now there's a twist.
[2:21:32] <arcade0416> ok so you CAN grapple, but once you're up there you have a ONE second delay before the gargoyle explodes
[2:21:35] <rytisone> and just like that, the game got a lot more tougher
[2:21:35] <%X2Eliah> gargoyles = trap
[2:21:38] <T_Sasquatch> It's time TO GET GUD
[2:21:39] <+chiazam> NO GARGOYLES FOR YOU
[2:21:41] <Doctadaking> Time to use the environment. Game‚Äôs telling ya to forgo the gargoyles
[2:21:43] <Laironx3> No help from gargoyle friend
[2:21:44] <devanmuse> Now do a stealth section without the crutch of gargoyles
[2:21:45] <uncledoodsauce> this fits with the batman forever snes soundtrack
[2:21:45] <NoireRequiem> nice n easy
[2:21:50] <deviljhojho_> never back down woolie

[2:22:25] <@Solidus_113> calculated
[2:22:26] <arcade0416> there is a slight delay though so you can still grapple as long as you hurry off it afterwards
[2:22:26] <NumbF4ke> Got away tho
[2:22:29] <NoireRequiem> @chosenjuan42 nope
[2:22:31] <%aram909> so much great tight game design in this game
[2:22:35] <%aram909> a lot of it thrown away for the sequels

[2:23:21] <NoireRequiem> Woolie is batmanning
[2:23:23] <deviljhojho_> sneaky sneaky
[2:23:30] <sunnythedrunk> Taking away gargoyles made Woolie 200% better
[2:23:31] <+mundanelotus> this is way better thatn hanging out on ledges
[2:23:31] <+chosenjuan42> HUEHUEHUE
[2:23:32] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you can grapple to the building

[2:24:10] <arcade0416> gotta time it right
[2:24:10] <RWLJr98> Joe
[2:24:11] <Asuterisuku> Ground Takedowns have no i-frames.
[2:24:11] <cpl_chipmunk> GG ez
[2:24:15] <dundore77> you get iframes during theh combo takedowns no other ones
[2:24:16] <BlackermanZX> tis just a scratch
[2:24:16] <+condemned_15> he was staring straight at you
[2:24:16] <+DomunDomunDomun> Not a combo takedown.
[2:24:17] <$arcielardor> "stealth"
[2:24:22] <%X2Eliah> I-frames is cheating
[2:24:23] <+chosenjuan42> You are instealth
[2:24:23] <brachydios777> One left
[2:24:24] <TheWizardOfWordplay> that's bait
[2:24:34] <deviljhojho_> not bad
[2:24:34] <%agoaj> Whoooo!
[2:24:35] <%CptnCampy61> Stealth is different
[2:24:35] <leith_aziz> Nice
[2:24:35] <arcade0416> @T_Sasquatch in later games you can cancel your silent takedowns with an Instant Knockout. it's Louder but it lets you escape getting shot a bunch if you're caught by surprise mid-takedown
[2:24:36] <+mundanelotus> sick

[2:25:10] <%emptyantics> Batman had OTG‚Äôs
[2:25:12] <Doctadaking> Weird that the music‚Äôs still going
[2:25:13] <+chosenjuan42> In combat I frames exist in takedowns that use combo meter

[2:34:18] <peachy996> I like how it's just Joker
[2:34:20] <dukenux> yeah, Scarface sounds like Joker
[2:34:20] <cosmicgoatee> Scarface is such a cool villian, and I don't think he does anything else than talk lol
[2:34:23] <$doomerskeletor13> So what the hell LUL
[2:34:23] <+Euphbugg> Slipped
[2:34:26] <dekkitout> "Manned"
[2:34:29] <brachydios777> Slip up
[2:34:29] <rlayers> press detective vision to make him laugh
[2:34:29] <krock90> hamill sound a bit like Willem Dafoe
[2:34:32] <+mundanelotus> I just noticed you momentarily change into scarecrow model
[2:34:37] <dukenux> me neither
[2:34:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> scarface is a pretty one note villain but he can be fun
[2:34:43] <dukenux> that's what slippers are for
[2:34:52] <leith_aziz> I gotta give props to Scarecrows voice here
[2:34:57] <leith_aziz> Its awesome
[2:35:02] <RWLJr98> Why have Scarface when you can have TwoFace?
[2:35:12] <peachy996> Because Scarface is a puppet but they found a great way to make him work in this
[2:35:13] <VirkaLlon> joker just talking shit on intercom LUL
[2:35:22] <brachydios777> Clutch
[2:35:27] <radar410> This kinda makes me wish that Insomniac did a horror style section like this for Venom in the Spiderman sequel. Probably won't happen though
[2:35:28] <leith_aziz> Clutch
[2:35:32] <%akuda_bar> you note, they know he's bruce wayne here because he's in his own head anyway
[2:35:34] <%LastHazzerd> i wish scarecrow didn't laugh, i wanna hear the tv
[2:35:35] <jorniev> WHT
[2:35:35] <T_Sasquatch> monkaS

[2:35:51] <PWNMAKER> LUL
[2:35:55] <Doctadaking> Notice how you turn into scarecrow during those flashes
[2:35:55] <brachydios777> Weird
[2:35:58] <leith_aziz> @radar410 The closest we got was that mr Negative section
[2:36:02] <%NorthGrizzly> Why are WB ports SO SHIT
[2:36:10] <%X2Eliah> BOOM BOOM GOO
[2:36:16] <+Ricky_Rexx> I honestly love the syringe claw
[2:36:29] <$doomerskeletor13> These are some of the coolest sections in the game
[2:36:29] <peachy996> I think the Negative sections were sucky honestly
[2:36:30] <mortificent> Na not venom, Mysterio needs a sequence like this
[2:36:30] <leith_aziz> Old WB games seem fine on PC, but now they consistently suck
[2:36:31] <Asuterisuku> With PhysX enabled there's usually stuff flying around in all of these.
[2:36:31] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[2:36:33] <Dio_TR> LUL
[2:36:34] <dinnydanny777> Scarecrow's got some nice abs
[2:36:39] <+vanareus> just counter the three story titan
[2:36:40] <+Undenizen> he really does
[2:36:44] <%aram909> yah this is mysterio AF
[2:36:44] <Asuterisuku> And without them the scene isn't quite the same.
[2:36:45] <brachydios777> I screwed uped on that too
[2:36:48] <dekkitout> If you like this scarecrow, look up Future State Scarecrow, shit's wild
[2:36:53] <Dio_TR> Scarecrow is lean af
[2:36:53] <%NorthGrizzly> they are so forgiving

[2:37:05] <+vanareus> Future State Scarecrow is string
[2:37:10] <+vanareus> strong*
[2:37:11] <T_Sasquatch> Yes!
[2:37:14] <mortificent> Mysterio is the most likely to do this type of shit
[2:37:32] <Asuterisuku> A glimpse of the real world.
[2:37:39] <T_Sasquatch> Spiderman 2 has the best mysterio boss fight
[2:37:42] <leith_aziz> Man, Batman can take some drugs
[2:37:47] <RWLJr98> UGGGGHH
[2:37:50] <+SolidusRex> Am I the only one who likes when Scarecrow is kind of a creepy but scrawny nerd like in this game or most of BTAS instead of some weird zombie like in BTAS's final season or Arkham Knight
[2:37:54] <+condemned_15> Scarecrow just Beefin' in your face
[2:37:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> DADADADDA
[2:38:04] <dinnydanny777> You'd think Batman would have some kind of breathing gadget
[2:38:06] <ScreamLord> SKELETON WARRIORS

[2:38:17] <rlayers> when u see the flash above thats when u counter
[2:38:19] <$doomerskeletor13> The Skeleton Goons
[2:38:19] <+Ricky_Rexx> is batman ok with killing the undead?
[2:38:24] <cosmicgoatee> Yeah Skeletons!
[2:38:24] <dabeaminator> They have Scorpion do this stuff in Spider-Man PS4, but Mysterio would've been a better pick I agree.
[2:38:25] <+chosenjuan42> Dont predict react
[2:38:25] <Asuterisuku> Hi Bane.
[2:38:27] <leith_aziz> @SolidusRex I think his design in the last BTAS season was fantastic in being scarey. Knight I dont know
[2:38:28] <Tracazoid> Yeah you don't need to counter unless the big blue symbol shows up and only then.
[2:38:28] <npsmh> ah yes round 3 against Sillian Murphy

[2:38:44] <uncledoodsauce> this is why spiderman is better
[2:38:46] <+NopeBadguy> man this game aged really badly...
[2:38:46] <radar410> @radar410 Would be cool if they went all out though, like Rocksteady did for the Killer Croc section here. Venom is the perfect villain for that. But I guess they have to keep it PG13, a problem that Arkham games didn't have
[2:38:47] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Big Bone Guy!
[2:38:49] <+MagiKestral> Okay but the fact that he explodes is pretty funny
[2:38:50] <+mundanelotus> woolieOMG

[2:39:17] <LunarRemix> It's the only one they have
[2:39:18] <LunarRemix> lol
[2:39:30] <thelivingglitch307> 2spooky4me
[2:39:31] <peachy996> I'm trying to think how many titans are in City. There's a good amount
[2:39:33] <Asuterisuku> The slowdown on the batarang hit is too much.
[2:39:35] <Reckless_Rob> WHy is that funny?
[2:39:35] <AvroEltz> batmans biggest fear, SKELETON WARRIORS
[2:39:37] <leith_aziz> So glad TITANS were fixed in City
[2:39:39] <+chosenjuan42> you should do challenge rooms to lab
[2:39:40] <%Monkeyweed21> ANOTHER ONE
[2:39:40] <peachy996> But more spread out
[2:39:43] <@Menitta> Everyone knows that Batman is afraid of bats but his other deep fear is skeletons
[2:39:47] <iLike_femboys> the titan fights are way more fun in city
[2:39:48] <kamenspidey> guess you could say the bane bosses all share the same skeleton
[2:39:50] <brachydios777> Basically
[2:39:55] <RWLJr98> @peachy996 like 3 I believe
[2:39:56] <phantalime> hope ya like 5 Capra demons in a row
[2:39:57] <leith_aziz> IM BATMAN
[2:40:01] <rytisone> I'm Batman

[2:40:12] <dabeaminator> @peachy996 Do you just mean big-man boss fights? In City there are only two, and they aren't as bad as this.
[2:40:12] <bamboostick4> I'm Daredevil

[2:40:17] <Dio_TR> BATMAN BEGINS PLOT
[2:40:18] <%RyTYoung> @menitta So he's scared of himself being a bat and scared of himself being a skeleton? LUL
[2:40:25] <dukenux> "Who am i? I'm Spider-man"
[2:40:27] <leith_aziz> This sections were great
[2:40:27] <+Ricky_Rexx> Scarecrow never existed all along!
[2:40:28] <Asuterisuku> Foreshaaaaadowiiiiiing
[2:40:34] <maskeddudej> not even a person, just batman
[2:40:35] <brachydios777> Scare crow is a good villain
[2:40:37] <%wibbwobbler> uh oh
[2:40:39] <MinersLoveGames> That's such a fun little detail of having you be surrounded by unconcious goons when you break out of the dream.
[2:40:42] <peachy996> I mean actual Titans, I'm not talking about Hammer or Sickle
[2:40:42] <puluxor> I always thought he said "enough to drive DEAD men insane" asakuraThink
[2:40:44] <Depthcharge2030> Scarecrow is just a fun videogame villain
[2:40:45] <%aram909> proximity explosive gel is powerful
[2:40:46] <Lancaster_H> skeletons are spooky
[2:40:47] <+condemned_15> how about remote batarang
[2:40:47] <frostyjay3> @RyTYoung I think Batman is just scared
[2:40:50] <dukenux> More Bat than a Man at this point
[2:40:53] <RWLJr98> HP
[2:40:53] <lunocura> Tags: Mind Break, Horror, Drugs
[2:40:56] <peachy996> By the way Hammer and Sickle are awesome
[2:40:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> they should put scarecrow in a fighting game
[2:41:06] <+NopeBadguy> why is the armor upgrade icon just him getting hype
[2:41:08] <leith_aziz> @Ricky_Rexx Injustice 2
[2:41:10] <Asuterisuku> @Ricky_Rexx They did. Injustice happened.
[2:41:11] <T_Sasquatch> @ricky_rexx HahaThink
[2:41:13] <+Ricky_Rexx> that was the joke
[2:41:14] <+vanareus> scarecrow in in Injustice 2 and is awesome
[2:41:15] <%RyTYoung> @frostyjay3 that's fair, skeleton warriors don't mess around
[2:41:15] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @Ricky_Rexx is that a joike
[2:41:16] <$doomerskeletor13> @ricky_rexx I have good news for you
[2:41:16] <cosmicgoatee> scarecrow is one of my favorite villains, shame Batman begins didn't have him in it as prominently
[2:41:19] <dinnydanny777> Scarecrow kinda looks short
[2:41:20] <Doctadaking> How is scarecrow‚Äôs mask mouth moving?
[2:41:23] <Dante_Namikaze1> @nopebadguy they did Injustice 2
[2:41:24] <huskarl_zap> his dnd dice bag
[2:41:24] <thelivingglitch307> @peachy996 down with capitalism

[2:41:29] <LunarRemix> Re-use as many assets as you want!
[2:41:30] <sunnythedrunk> There's a reason Spiderman reused the idea with the Scorpion scens
[2:41:30] <dekkitout> He's a 6ft manlet
[2:41:36] <%RyTYoung> SCARECROW FOR GOTHAM MAYOR
[2:41:37] <Onamar> Is this before the "Oh god is my GPU dying" scare?

[2:41:46] <Doctadaking> Understandable
[2:41:47] <Asuterisuku> @Onamar He just passed it.
[2:41:49] <phantalime> this series is full of "Batman got drugged, time for some WEEIRD SHIT" moments
[2:41:53] <iLike_femboys> yus

[2:42:12] <deviljhojho_> do king omves
[2:42:12] <mr_saturday93> no fall damage in this game
[2:42:16] <Doctadaking> And so Batman cast himself off the highest elevator shaft...
[2:42:19] <+condemned_15> well now youre stuck
[2:42:19] <HolyGriddles> Fall damage is nothing to the Batman
[2:42:20] <Dio_TR> lmao now you have to climb up again
[2:42:20] <+chosenjuan42> how did he miss the giant hole
[2:42:21] <RWLJr98> No fall damage
[2:42:24] <+chiazam> Fall damage? In this game?
[2:42:26] <peachy996> No fall damage in the whole series
[2:42:29] <+condemned_15> you gotta climb back up now
[2:42:31] <T_Sasquatch> Scorpion in Spiderman doing Scarecrow shit was dumb
[2:42:34] <RamenRiderZ> At least theyre not like the Wacky Far Cry Drug Sequences‚Ñ¢
[2:42:38] <Asuterisuku> That scare got me BAD the first time I played this game; i was on a laptop and also broke.
[2:42:39] <PWNMAKER> LUL
[2:42:41] <huskarl_zap> You can't stop me from eating all these pies batman
[2:42:48] <huskarl_zap> said Scarecrow
[2:43:00] <dukenux> atleast the setting justifies psychotropic drugs just lying around
[2:43:02] <leith_aziz> @T_Sasquatch Actually the floor is lava section was great, but the fear stuff, ehhh
[2:43:03] <%dreadedcthulhu> hey that's bender
[2:43:05] <FromGoon2Goon> Scarecrow is The Ultimate What If creator
[2:43:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> basically
[2:43:23] <T_Sasquatch> @ramenriderz the weed section is a clasdic tho. Plus the music , absolute banger
[2:43:27] <dinnydanny777> Why would you follow Scarecrow as a goon? limesHmm
[2:43:27] <+samuraiknack> Haven't heard Steve Blum in a while
[2:43:30] <@Menitta> what if batman was crazy
[2:43:33] <sunnythedrunk> Scarecrow the greatest fanfiction writer of our generation
[2:43:35] <+GTCknight> I disagree. The fact that Batman buys into what he sees is dumb especially, since he's been dealing with Scarecrow for at least 20 plus times
[2:43:43] <Asuterisuku> B to handle guys with knives.
[2:43:48] <+PlatinumRevol> This music is what make sme think of Asylum
[2:43:48] <RWLJr98> ITS THE BAAAT
[2:43:51] <leith_aziz> @Menitta If that aint sarcasm, there's the Batman who laughs
[2:43:56] <dinnydanny777> @gtcknight Fear isn't rational though
[2:43:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:43:57] <peachy996> The Scorpion section in Spidey is alright but it can't compare to the many ways Arkham did it first
[2:44:02] <dukenux> yeah, but Batman's theme is that he kinda doesn't learn
[2:44:04] <sunnythedrunk> @GTCknight I mean people buy into dreams even if they are totally ridiculous
[2:44:08] <+ja07sj> when you brain is pumped full of fear gas, you're probably not at your most rational
[2:44:14] <dabeaminator> Does the batclaw pull guns out of people's hands in Asylum without an upgrade?
[2:44:15] <peachy996> But it was still one of the better parts of Spidey
[2:44:21] <+samuraiknack> Guys hear me out I have a cash money idead
[2:44:21] <leith_aziz> Dreams have no limit
[2:44:30] <iLike_femboys> tape D:
[2:44:30] <arcade0416> if it's any consolation, woolie, those knife guys do NOT make a proper return in any of the follow-up games. there are spiritual successors but they're far less annoying
[2:44:31] <leith_aziz> They can get batshit insanne
[2:44:36] <T_Sasquatch> @peachy996 (X) DOUBT
[2:44:41] <jorniev> can he do the arm break yet or is that in the next game?
[2:44:44] <TheWizardOfWordplay> no batclaw disarm until city
[2:44:45] <Asuterisuku> If I recall, having controller rumble on helps for these.
[2:44:46] <mortificent> I hope the next Insomniac Spiderman game has a Mysterio section
[2:44:46] <RamenRiderZ> Batman's Hacker PSP
[2:44:47] <+samuraiknack> What if Superman was evil?
[2:44:47] <BurdRightsActivist> Batman playing kid icarus uprisingn
[2:44:48] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[2:44:49] <+GTCknight> The fourth-wall bit is good tho
[2:44:50] <sunnythedrunk> Spidey scorpion scenes are really carried by the Doc Oc stuff
[2:44:51] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Batman taking a sneak peek around lol
[2:44:51] <brachydios777> Batman playing his psp
[2:44:52] <dukenux> i get why they'd like to have a spooky section like that in Spider-man, but why Scorpion?
[2:44:58] <Asuterisuku> Skated in under the time limit.
[2:45:00] <+chosenjuan42> Ground takendown are not invincible. However Combo takedowns that use combo meter is totally invincible
[2:45:02] <+Superbro64> knives, batmans one true weakness

[2:46:18] <thunka10> It was
[2:46:19] <+SolidusRex> It was
[2:46:19] <Doctadaking> In the show, she sounded much more normal.
[2:46:20] <%shad8snake> its different
[2:46:22] <Brutusness> every Arkham psychiatrist should lose their license
[2:46:23] <dukenux> yea
[2:46:23] <KaiserMario> it was
[2:46:24] <leith_aziz> What do you mean ?
[2:46:27] <sunnythedrunk> Harley is pretty dumbed down here
[2:46:28] <Reckless_Rob> Protracted?
[2:46:29] <+condemned_15> this isn't the animated series
[2:46:33] <osaka_daioh> i prefer the original version
[2:46:33] <miucsa51> it was woolie
[2:46:39] <peachy996> Personally I prefer the way Origins does this but I will admit the Asylum version is funnier
[2:46:40] <+ja07sj> she wasn't crazy to begin with in TAS
[2:46:40] <leith_aziz> (my vocabilary aint the best)
[2:46:42] <+SolidusRex> You are correct Woolie
[2:46:43] <RWLJr98> This is a different timeline
[2:46:44] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @reckless_rob Drawn out
[2:46:44] <%Tearonex> She was way more normal starting out in the animated series than in this
[2:46:44] <+BigBlackBankai> 23 minutes there 5 minutes here
[2:46:46] <osaka_daioh> yeah Joker played her much better in TAS
[2:46:46] <Dio_TR> You gotta remember this game is rated T instead of the "all ages" batman animated series show
[2:46:48] <arcade0416> i love arnee sorkin but i feel like she wasn't super invested in this game? might explain why they replaced her with Tara Strong for the sequels
[2:46:48] <Shardlab> Mad Love had a whole episode. Harleen had a full miniseries. This has four audio logs
[2:46:49] <KaiserMario> OG Harley is still best
[2:46:53] <brachydios777> A reminder that Harley literally boned her way to her position in her original origin
[2:46:57] <Reckless_Rob> @WaitHowDidIGetHere Ah
[2:46:58] <%NorthGrizzly> Harley was always pretty dumb
[2:47:02] <Chester_goes_Berserk> this was heavily based on the animated series, but yeah, became its own separate series
[2:47:02] <thunka10> In the animated series Harley had her gaurd down since she was the one doing the interviewing
[2:47:06] <T_Sasquatch> I think Harley already had a fetish for joker and the criminally insane
[2:47:06] <HolyGriddles> Harley is good in Knight
[2:47:10] <+Undenizen> hey what are THOSE guys doing down there? I thought this was the feeding pit
[2:47:12] <sunnythedrunk> To be fair the animated series is just the master class of batman
[2:47:14] <BurdRightsActivist> Harley Quinnn bimbofication 4Head
[2:47:15] <$doomerskeletor13> @arcade0416 She retired because she got cancer, that‚Äôs why they used Tara

[2:47:59] <dekkitout> I think in a TAS canon comic, Harley was retconned to be... "less scrupulous"...
[2:48:05] <brachydios777> @dante_namikaze1 Yeah it was, I think it was in the comic version of Mad Love
[2:48:05] <Prevot> @dukenux especially now, with the current world troubles...

[2:48:13] <%footloosepariah> Hello, Woolie. Been a long time fan since the days of Chrono Trigger and TWD S1. I'm glad I can finally be able to help support ya directly now. Loving what you do, keep up the good work, Woolie and Reggie. Love ya both. PS: If you end up playing Arkham City I think you will greatly appreciate the revamped combat and skill selection. I used to do many no armor, no damage taken, pure physical combat runs of City. Had tons of fun with it.

[2:50:22] <%krispen_wa> remember when they assigned women to ZSASZ!?
[2:50:22] <+chosenjuan42> LOOK AT HIS ARM
[2:50:22] <AvroEltz> losing a hand makes you scurred
[2:50:22] <%Tearonex> To conquer his FEAR of Croc
[2:50:23] <+FuqBoiSlim> This is post-crisis Cash

[2:50:23] <+chiazam> HIM HAVING A FEAR OF HIM IS GOOD
[2:50:24] <crocboyz> hand gone by croc when therapy
[2:50:25] <%orcstr16> He got that fear from working with crok
[2:50:25] <peachy996> He wasn't afraid until Croc took a chomp out of his hand
[2:50:27] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus this was before that
[2:50:28] <thunka10> hand woolie
[2:50:29] <VirkaLlon> fear created by loss of hand

[2:50:30] <thunka10> HAND
[2:50:31] <mudamudajo> After croc ate his hand, he became afraid.
[2:50:32] <leith_aziz> He probably got scared ONCE Croc wounded him
[2:50:33] <mr_saturday93> How does woolie function?
[2:50:34] <+Jiggisnipe> for good reason
[2:50:37] <slim_shady2019> Croc ate his hand
[2:50:38] <%Monkeyweed21> He used croc's skin to make a wallet
[2:50:39] <+Ricky_Rexx> Cash talked shit and got bit
[2:50:41] <+Reverend_Roscoe> thats hook
[2:50:43] <Torgue_1> Showing hate to something he fears? zekeTHINK
[2:50:45] <FrostedZaibatsu> He's the guy from Billy Madison
[2:50:45] <marumiyan1> chill out guys
[2:50:45] <MinersLoveGames> Generally having your hand torn off by Croc will put a fear in you.
[2:50:46] <peachy996> And even then? Cash isn't too spooked by Croc
[2:50:48] <dekkitout> Build the road after you drive off the cliff tajC
[2:50:48] <Reckless_Rob> Nah, Croc said he has his taste
[2:50:51] <dukenux> Talk shit, get bit

[2:52:37] <Asuterisuku> Just gonna stay quiet about that.
[2:52:37] <arcade0416> oh my god, croc attacked him so hard that he got an entirely different voice actor and became really boring in the final game D:
[2:52:38] <$doomerskeletor13> Hmmm tasty
[2:52:38] <+MightyDuckShoes> that's good!
[2:52:39] <phantalime> Don't worry about him for another few games

[2:52:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> Hes not going to be in Rush Hour 2
[2:52:40] <%aram909> this just makes my theory that scarecrow in arkham knight is a different person
[2:52:40] <puluxor> This generic sewer seems like the MOST UNSAFE place to "imprison" a huge, freakishly strong monster man tyrantBruh
[2:52:41] <dukenux> not enough meat on the bone
[2:52:41] <+Shonen_hero> nah you could see his parachute
[2:52:42] <devanmuse> Damn! He ain't gonna be in Arkham Asylum 2
[2:52:42] <%Monkeyweed21> goes down real smooth
[2:52:43] <+Ricky_Rexx> Could just say eaten
[2:52:44] <MinersLoveGames> Get that Sewer Count on screen.
[2:52:48] <thelivingglitch307> we will never see Scarecrow again
[2:52:49] <peachy996> Nah he's fine just looking different for later
[2:52:50] <%Nomad_Scholar> Croc gonna choke on dem bones
[2:52:50] <Neoripo> Tastes like hay
[2:52:53] <+Undenizen> @Ricky_Rexx we COULD be cowards.
[2:52:54] <AvroEltz> the enemy of my enemy is my friend
[2:52:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its fine
[2:52:56] <MadFoxOfGamez> Welp , the last batman happening
[2:52:58] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Oh no Scarecrow is dead FOREVER!!!
[2:52:59] <%Monkeyweed21> it despawned
[2:53:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> ITS GONE
[2:53:00] <+chosenjuan42> Croc don't eat the bat that how 2020 happened
[2:53:01] <+Superbro64> Batmam: "Well *I* didnt kill him"
[2:53:02] <+NocturnePsycho> what bag ;)
[2:53:02] <MadFoxOfGamez> ain‚Äôt
[2:53:03] <twoto858> Bag's gone, don't worry about it
[2:53:05] <TheWizardOfWordplay> he got it
[2:53:09] <leith_aziz> How did the spores not reach the water ?
[2:53:09] <arcade0416> i hate to say it but i think arkham knight scarecrow is super fucking boring so as far as i'm concerned this is a death scene
[2:53:10] <%emptyantics> Literally dead
[2:53:10] <Dio_TR> CUTSCENE DIMENSION
[2:53:13] <+condemned_15> the bag despawned Kappa
[2:53:13] <Jashter18> I think Bats picked it up
[2:53:13] <+Javaa01> No, it didn't
[2:53:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> No it fell on the ground and it's not an issue anymore
[2:53:14] <brachydios777> It hit the floor
[2:53:14] <Doctadaking> Bag went back to its home planet
[2:53:14] <mudamudajo> Naw your good
[2:53:15] <$doomerskeletor13> It only existed in the cutscene dimension
[2:53:15] <Zebroneath> the problem is solved!
[2:53:16] <phantalime> nah it went to video game world
[2:53:19] <thunka10> green poo water
[2:53:19] <%LastHazzerd> the water was already green
[2:53:20] <+Katohearts> He's probably fine, killer croc doesn't kill...wai
[2:53:20] <Zebroneath> All in a days work!
[2:53:20] <sunnythedrunk> Killer Croc the real hero
[2:53:20] <BlackermanZX> damn this game has all the tags. fisting, mind break, vore StinkyGlitch
[2:53:20] <+chosenjuan42> overthink
[2:53:23] <+TwitchZoomer2021> ...Wut?
[2:53:27] <Asuterisuku> It's Croc time.
[2:53:28] <RWLJr98> Some family will get the brunt of it
[2:53:31] <gunsrlove> I guess he got better for Akrham Knight?
[2:53:33] <iLike_femboys> scarecrow is way too skinny to feed croc
[2:53:37] <Dio_TR> I like how they subtetly teach you about what you can do
[2:53:37] <leith_aziz> Croc time
[2:53:38] <peachy996> Arkham Knight Scarecrow...the VA change is really noticable and sadly he doesn't do much in Knight

[2:54:21] <arcade0416> ok, woolie...move VERY slowly
[2:54:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> Some kind of suicide mission?
[2:54:22] <dukenux> "Oracle, i'm a sewer level"
[2:54:22] <asurite_warrior> I think it's funny how scarecrow was like this one bag of fear toxin will affect the whole city. and not just dissipate over the whole bay
[2:54:24] <twoto858> I really like this part
[2:54:24] <$doomerskeletor13> You ready Woolie
[2:54:24] <@Solidus_113> it's fucking party time
[2:54:28] <i_need_context_> this is one of my fav areas
[2:54:28] <penitentpendant> I forget, I think this area didn't have a map so you'd have to use the locator
[2:54:28] <dukenux> *in
[2:54:29] <%aurasviel> Croc traumatized little 8 year old me
[2:54:30] <Dio_TR> yeyeyeyeye

[2:54:42] <deviljhojho_> monkaS
[2:54:42] <HolyGriddles> You are the result of croc x scarecrow interaction in Knight

[2:54:44] <Dio_TR> LUL
[2:54:45] <Asuterisuku> Here, have the game's actually good boss fight.
[2:54:47] <deviljhojho_> oh no
[2:54:48] <+JonathLP> batman likes to give the bad guys a chance with artificial difficulty
[2:54:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> slow
[2:54:51] <Neoripo> Oh god this
[2:54:51] <+condemned_15> LUL
[2:54:51] <HolyGriddles> You see the result*

[2:54:52] <penitentpendant> Usin' them stealth mechanics again
[2:54:53] <MinersLoveGames> Fuck this part.
[2:54:53] <SainEdge> oh no
[2:54:53] <mr_saturday93> it's SUPER easy to cheese this part

[2:54:56] <%Robot_Nixon_> monkaS
[2:54:56] <godila2> i hate this level
[2:54:56] <iLike_femboys> crocs are scary in general
[2:54:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> Pure atmosphere
[2:54:57] <+GenesisKnight> He's not a shark
[2:54:58] <enerkaizer> no shark repellent here
[2:54:58] <dinnydanny777> Batsharks limesHmm
[2:54:59] <TheWizardOfWordplay> crouch walk is fine
[2:55:01] <thelivingglitch307> TURTLE MAN
[2:55:01] <derap41> That's for sharks you idiot
[2:55:01] <thunka10> monkaS
[2:55:01] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You can move faster than that. its ok Woolie
[2:55:02] <$doomerskeletor13> He‚Äôs a crocodile tho
[2:55:02] <dekkitout> That's for King Shark
[2:55:02] <coreybom> @gunsrlove I mean, rule of law and such. If Gotham doesn‚Äôt have the death penalty or he didn‚Äôt get it, well?
[2:55:03] <%aram909> you can go faster, crouch walk is fine
[2:55:04] <peachy996> Only works on King Shark
[2:55:07] <+JonathLP> you can move as fast as you want that keeps the sound between the 2 yellow lines
[2:55:07] <mudamudajo> regular crouch walk speed is good
[2:55:08] <iLike_femboys> member the big white croc in red dead 2? scary af
[2:55:09] <%LastHazzerd> Shark is a different villian
[2:55:10] <BlackermanZX> oh man monkaS
[2:55:10] <+Undenizen> idk what you guys are talking about - i found this fight laughably easy
[2:55:13] <+1spidersymbiotepool> quick batarang dat neck
[2:55:13] <Dio_TR> IT'S MR X TIME yeyeyeye
[2:55:14] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you can move at full speed that way
[2:55:14] <$doomerskeletor13> Reggies fave lmao
[2:55:14] <+condemned_15> you can go faster as long as youre crouched
[2:55:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> HERE WW GO
[2:55:16] <leith_aziz> wow this is tense (im serious)
[2:55:16] <$doomerskeletor13> Face
[2:55:17] <Torgue_1> Shark repellant works on crocodiles, yes
[2:55:17] <Doctadaking> I think you can move at max speed while crouching on Normal
[2:55:19] <SainEdge> you really dont need to move this slow LUL
[2:55:21] <MikeStrider> fun fact, you don't actually have to go slow. You just can't run
[2:55:25] <+JonathLP> you can move full crouch speed
[2:55:25] <+klooswep> Silly Woolie, why are you listening to what the game tells you to do? Kappa
[2:55:25] <NeoseekerStitch> this is gonna take all week
[2:55:26] <TheyCallMeVawn> You dont have to move this slow
[2:55:29] <%Robot_Nixon_> NO ELPERS
[2:55:30] <dukenux> not a great section
[2:55:30] <+DoktorZee> no its more fun when theyre scared to move
[2:55:32] <JanusII> No, chat, you're wrong, shark repellant isn't for sharks, don't be stupid.
[2:55:32] <arcade0416> fun fact! if you move slow enough and stop frequently, you actually CAN get through this area without encountering croc basically AT ALL besides the scripted bits
[2:55:33] <leith_aziz> This might take a while
[2:55:34] <+Javaa01> No running
[2:55:35] <SheefEatsBeef> it's in the top left
[2:55:36] <@Solidus_113> test it mr tester man
[2:55:36] <Asuterisuku> Yukkuri... Yukkuri...
[2:55:36] <leith_aziz> Sound
[2:55:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> He's playing it safe
[2:55:37] <brachydios777> No help guys
[2:55:37] <derap41> Remember this was an "iconic" boss level
[2:55:38] <+JonathLP> sound
[2:55:39] <peachy996> It's fine if he's slow
[2:55:39] <TheyCallMeVawn> Look to the left on the screen
[2:55:40] <+GenesisKnight> Move as slowly as possible
[2:55:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big snorts
[2:55:41] <%aram909> this game has very simple stealth rules
[2:55:41] <asurite_warrior> honestly a good chunk of batman villans would be categorized as terrorists and shot
[2:55:43] <+JonathLP> the meter is on the left
[2:55:44] <MinersLoveGames> I went this slow my first time through as well.
[2:55:46] <%aram909> crouch means silent, no matter which speed
[2:55:46] <Dio_TR> Another BANE FIGHT HUH WOOLIE Kappa
[2:55:46] <iLike_femboys> as long as you dont run
[2:55:46] <Darren716> tbf going slow is good for the atmosphere
[2:55:46] <HolyGriddles> You‚Äôll know. There‚Äôs a meter
[2:55:51] <RWLJr98> You could run and be fine
[2:55:52] <%jonblnt> i don't blame you woolz
[2:55:52] <+Ricky_Rexx> Just gotta be ready for anything
[2:55:53] <Jashter18> Go full speed Woolie just out run the Croc
[2:55:54] <TheWizardOfWordplay> full speed crouch walk
[2:55:54] <TheyCallMeVawn> Theres a sound meter
[2:55:54] <gunsrlove> @coreybom rule of law for huge jacked lizard serial killers could be bent a little bit, you know some guard will pop him and get it over with
[2:55:55] <+FuzzyGuru> video game stealth peaked in Thief 2
[2:55:55] <+condemned_15> theres a meter on the screen
[2:55:56] <mudamudajo> Keep the shaking lines inside the two borders
[2:55:56] <Doctadaking> This section made me so paranoid as a kid
[2:55:56] <+chosenjuan42> only if there was some sort of new meter
[2:55:57] <leith_aziz> (dont spoil)
[2:55:57] <rlayers> this will take a while
[2:56:01] <marumiyan1> let him do his thing
[2:56:01] <DrkJP520> Depends on the slowest movement speed with keyboard controls
[2:56:01] <$doomerskeletor13> I am become speed
[2:56:02] <mortificent> almost all Batman villains are terrorists
[2:56:03] <+Euphbugg> I hate when any game just has "go slow" as the advice. always feels like I need to crawl.
[2:56:04] <leith_aziz> Lets see how far he goes
[2:56:10] <dinnydanny777> Jumping is surprisingly quiet limesHmm
[2:56:10] <Dio_TR> LUL
[2:56:11] <+Ricky_Rexx> I think it's more sensitive on higher difficulties
[2:56:12] <+JonathLP> also you can cheat with the zipline
[2:56:14] <deviljhojho_> YEAH
[2:56:15] <cosmicgoatee> he's a killer...croooc
[2:56:15] <%krispen_wa> Snake, this is a sneaking mission
[2:56:16] <%Robot_Nixon_> just go full speed EleGiggle
[2:56:16] <%X2Eliah> It's ok, you're supposed to sneak slowly
[2:56:24] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[3:00:40] <+JonathLP> You laugh but if he wasn't wearing the shock collar
[3:00:42] <Depthcharge2030> he'd win if he had a rock
[3:00:44] <Asuterisuku> Reggie went from terrified to normal in no time flat.
[3:00:46] <eldragon_1> Jobber Croc
[3:00:48] <mudamudajo> More like Bitch croc

[3:09:38] <+taggerung403> what kind of skin condition makes his smell so good anyway
[3:09:48] <+Shonen_hero> this is getting silly
[3:09:50] <arcade0416> i mean if batman KNEW joker was gonna do a SUPER RIOT, he might have brought his anti-croc gear, but he's doing a really low-prep run this time around
[3:09:51] <RWLJr98> Stop bullying him!

[3:09:55] <mudamudajo> croc? croc?! CRRROOOOOOOOOCCC?!?!
[3:09:56] <%TheTyper> It's like that moment in Spongebob where the orchestra is revealed behind the curtain
[3:09:56] <+Jiggisnipe> it's great tho LUL really adds to the fun
[3:10:00] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Even simpler, why can't Batman swipe his Batcard on Killer Croc and make him go away? :)
[3:10:02] <%Dakuu75> Why does a sewer have all these floating pallets?
[3:10:03] <DatAsuna> It's that the music just abruptly stops right after too
[3:10:04] <penitentpendant> Up he comes, down he goes
[3:10:05] <leith_aziz> I feel like this would be even scarier WITHOUT music
[3:10:09] <+EdenOfLove> seriously
[3:10:10] <dinnydanny777> Maybe Croc wouldn't be so angry if he didn't live in a sewer limesHmm

[3:18:26] <+mundanelotus> invisible doors all over again
[3:18:27] <Asuterisuku> The City tease made Woolie paranoid.
[3:18:29] <%X2Eliah> THERES EVEN A LIGHT

[3:18:36] <%saladin1911> @doctadaking I straight up forgot she was in this game until this playthrough. She's so unimportant it's kinda sad.
[3:18:36] <Asuterisuku> That's the only secret like that in the game, by the way.
[3:18:36] <gunsrlove> Batman keeps tanking explosives with his chin
[3:18:38] <%cubbywolf> thats alot of human skulls
[3:18:38] <%Superspider51> that other one is the only one, that we know of
[3:18:41] <$doomerskeletor13> @dakuu75 He does NOT have anything better to do lmao

[3:18:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Dakuu75 He literally doesn't have anything better to do
[3:18:44] <+chosenjuan42> That was the only one
[3:18:45] <rytisone> watch Woolie find another secret that no one has ever found
[3:18:47] <+samuraiknack> Didn't wanna do another take on that last line Mr Conroy
[3:18:50] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:18:51] <arcade0416> @RWLJr98 i mean if you don't dilly-dally you can get this game 100%-ed in like less than 8 hours so i believe it
[3:18:51] <%cubbywolf> this part is so good imo
[3:18:53] <+condemned_15> there is only the one hidden wall. Don't worry about it

[3:22:29] <Neoripo> It's showing the path to follow
[3:22:31] <+MightyDuckShoes> Reggie: "Pathetic"
[3:22:31] <penitentpendant> Light Party! Spires of Arkham
[3:22:31] <%Monkeyweed21> This is where the game softlocks you if you play on a pirated copy
[3:22:31] <thefranchise00> Middle school me thought so..
[3:22:35] <+Ricky_Rexx> It's what they call a Majora Moon
[3:22:36] <Asuterisuku> Man, your cape is shredded.
[3:22:37] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @arcade0416
[3:22:40] <RWLJr98> Good music tho
[3:22:42] <rytisone> final stretch of the game
[3:22:42] <+skyheys> Those rocks looked like ass even back in 2009
[3:22:44] <JinJun1738> madxCRY madxCRY madxCRY
[3:22:45] <%X2Eliah> Guys there were also good-looking games back in 2009
[3:22:46] <+DeChunkandFriends> I thought that was earlier, @Monkeyweed21
[3:22:46] <peachy996> Moon Presence is watching you
[3:22:47] <%aram909> how the FUCK did riddler put the trophy there?
[3:22:47] <TheWizardOfWordplay> play his cards right he can beat it today
[3:22:48] <FrostedZaibatsu> Vaseline graphics at its finest
[3:22:50] <%Seancicle> FootYellow
[3:22:52] <+Superbro64> I thought it was cute, 12 years ago :(
[3:22:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> These advanced 2009 rock textures
[3:22:55] <gunsrlove> The biggest fattest powerlifters on steroids currently benched like 750-850 WITH a bench shirt
[3:22:56] <ioriac> right
[3:22:57] <SixthShinx> That Riddler Trophy was easy as hell
[3:23:01] <@Menitta> this was the same year as Uncharted 2
[3:23:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god this looks bad
[3:23:05] <dinnydanny777> I can't think of a good looking game from 2009 I'll be honest
[3:23:05] <cosmicgoatee> Reggie is that kid who got the 1090t calculator in class just to play games on it
[3:23:06] <LunarRemix> Man I love those rock textures
[3:23:06] <leith_aziz> Okay we get it. I meant the music at least
[3:23:06] <dekkitout> Seek Lazarus to transcend the night
[3:23:08] <arcade0416> now look i love this game but even i have to wonder how riddler got those trophies out here. did he have a hang glider? lol
[3:23:10] <%wibbwobbler> it's fiiine
[3:23:10] <sleepy_pixels> Hl2 looking rocks
[3:23:12] <casualshinji> You'd think he'd grab a new cape while he was in the batcave.
[3:23:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "you can see my house from here"
[3:23:17] <thunka10> Look at this rock, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you say this skybox is complete?
[3:23:18] <Jolly_Adventurer> @Dakuu75 Gotham is right next to Yharnam
[3:23:22] <+DoktorZee> if only you had the remote batarang
[3:23:22] <thefranchise00> yeah the textures here arent great
[3:23:26] <brachydios777> Odst looked pretty decent
[3:23:32] <Dakuu75> @Jolly_Adventurer lol
[3:23:35] <mudamudajo> Peak human physical condition is the best (not super strength and speed) but totally super strength and speed excuse in comics.
[3:23:40] <Doctadaking> No don‚Äôt look at that

[3:24:29] <Doctadaking> How the hell did Riddler get that there
[3:24:30] <RWLJr98> We will see who‚Äôs laughing when you see Arkham Knight
[3:24:31] <Daveythe6thMoon> "Ha! I made it! Suck it, Riddler!"
[3:24:31] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie just fucking winging it
[3:24:32] <arcade0416> honestly riddler is MAD dedicated
[3:24:33] <leith_aziz> Maybe its my nostalgia, but is it so bad worth mentioning ?
[3:24:39] <+skyheys> OOF, THAT POP IN
[3:24:42] <leith_aziz> I just focus on the music
[3:24:43] <heart_ablaze> this really makes you appreciate how far games have come in such little time
[3:24:44] <thunka10> HMM...
[3:24:45] <+FuqBoiSlim> How is he still gliding l with his cape all torn up like that?
[3:24:46] <Shardlab> Drones
[3:24:47] <balthazar758> 12 years.
[3:24:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> He got his ways
[3:24:49] <BlackermanZX> Arkham Jpeg city
[3:24:50] <sunnythedrunk> Riddler has a hell of an arm
[3:24:51] <+chosenjuan42> GOONS
[3:24:51] <%LastHazzerd> drones, yeah
[3:24:51] <%agoaj> Riddler Plane! and Riddler Ladder
[3:24:53] <KaiserMario> He used a "Riddler drone"
[3:24:53] <+taggerung403> The answer is pure spite
[3:24:54] <%Tearonex> He threw it
[3:24:54] <peachy996> It's not that bad but it is fun to look at now
[3:24:55] <thunka10> He used the Jim Carrey Riddlecopter
[3:24:55] <JanusII> Riddler's super power is free time.
[3:24:56] <%Seancicle> God mode enabled
[3:24:56] <dinnydanny777> He used his big brain
[3:24:57] <arcade0416> he has a hang glider and climbing equipment and pure rage
[3:24:58] <Torgue_1> He's THAT smart
[3:24:59] <HolyGriddles> What are we? Some kind of Arkham City?
[3:25:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @FuqBoiSlim shhhh
[3:25:00] <TheManWhosHot> Riddler asked the cliff a riddle and he won
[3:25:01] <DatAsuna> riddler hook
[3:25:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> most mmos still look worse than this
[3:25:01] <@Menitta> I do like the idea of the Riddler running around Arkham going "He'll NEVER get this one hehe"
[3:25:02] <leith_aziz> @peachy996 Fair
[3:25:03] <thunka10> each sold seperately
[3:25:05] <rytisone> this is nothing compared to what Riddler does in Arkham Knight
[3:25:07] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @leith_aziz Yes it's the games fault for being old Kappa
[3:25:07] <+Superbro64> @lasthazzerd drones in 2008 LUL
[3:25:09] <+BigBlackBankai> Riddler drones
[3:25:09] <+Exicuren> He asked superman to put it there Kappa
[3:25:10] <cosmicgoatee> the riddle knight rises
[3:25:10] <+vanareus> riddler just tweeting trophies from his high rise
[3:25:13] <%Dakuu75> how many Co2 canisters would batman need to carry to use his grapples'n shit, THIS much?
[3:25:16] <+thecosmicfly> He has... Quesdrones
[3:25:16] <+vanareus> yeeting*
[3:25:17] <Daveythe6thMoon> What we don't see are the dozens of Riddler Trophies at the bottom of this chasm that Riddler failed to toss to that island!
[3:25:19] <SoratheWonderful> It‚Äôs 12 years old in gaming that near retro age
[3:25:21] <+nabs2099> To be fair Jim Carrey was a good riddler. just needed a better director lol
[3:25:22] <DatAsuna> @MightyDuckShoes character models yeah, environments nah
[3:25:24] <thunka10> @HolyGriddles I'm crying bro
[3:25:24] <dinnydanny777> So did Riddler do all of this before the break our or after? limesHmm
[3:25:35] <leith_aziz> We've come a long way in graphics, thats for sure
[3:25:35] <%Superspider51> @dinnydanny777 yes
[3:25:43] <%KiwamiKiryu> Remember how if you pirate the game you can get up to this point but can't glide anymore? thus you won't make it any further
[3:25:43] <cosmicgoatee> did they scrap the Robert Pattinson Batman movie?
[3:25:44] <Asuterisuku> It had to have been before, right? He isn't on the island.
[3:25:44] <@Menitta> I like to imagine before
[3:25:49] <+chosenjuan42> @dinnydanny777 yes
[3:25:54] <TheManWhosHot> @dinnydanny777 Riddler is implied that he could escape whenever he wants so maybe before?
[3:25:55] <DatAsuna> but also mmos are meant to scale down to the potato laptops most mmo casuals use
[3:25:56] <RWLJr98> This part sometimes confuses me even when I play it today
[3:25:57] <@Menitta> So all the guards are like "Ugh we found ANOTHER ONE!"
[3:25:58] <+vanareus> before, I think he was on the loose already
[3:25:59] <arcade0416> @dinnydanny777 riddler wasn't even IN the asylum when this game started so i imagine these trophies have been here for like a WHILE
[3:26:01] <%emptyantics> Remember that time a penguin goon tries@to use the batclaw and his arm is almost torn off
[3:26:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:26:34] <%Dakuu75> Don't call your JET or anything Batman... just spend 5 hours zip-linning everywhere
[3:26:39] <Doctadaking> Somehow Croc‚Äôs hand tries to grab you as you zip line over that
[3:26:41] <dinnydanny777> @themanwhoshot I mean, I always assumed Riddler kind of bullshits a lot tbh
[3:26:42] <+skyheys> @mightyduckshoes Most MMOs still running were made before or shortly after this game
[3:27:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> batcave detroyed
[3:27:06] <arcade0416> "Hey Dave, should we scoop up some of these little Riddle-statues we keep finding in vents and up on shelves?" "Nah, I'm not gonna be Nigma's janitor until I get paid more than 15 an hour"
[3:27:19] <+nabs2099> I remember this part of the game confusing me quite a bit too.
[3:27:22] <+FuqBoiSlim> Another to the sewer level count
[3:27:43] <+Javaa01> Pullable and explodable walls look the same
[3:27:47] <Asuterisuku> You've seen quite a few, but it's up to you to remember where.
[3:27:49] <%Dakuu75> wut...
[3:27:52] <+vanareus> I guess they taze you if you grab it like in city, but then just put on rubber gloves lmao
[3:27:52] <%jonblnt> Fisted
[3:27:53] <SheefEatsBeef> popping ivy's pimples
[3:27:55] <TheManWhosHot> @dinnydanny777 I read this one comic once where he was in a maximum security prison that stated he had thought of hundreds of ways to escape and simply didn't bother to do it
[3:27:58] <arcade0416> the simulations.....
[3:27:58] <+nabs2099> I REALLY hope woolz does at least do City, if not the whole the series, just cos City has the best story by far.
[3:27:58] <FrostedZaibatsu> This is really obtuse. where is he going
[3:28:01] <Ultimatefool> The balls on Batman to just stick his hand in that thing
[3:28:04] <%ChoculaUltra> just fist those plants
[3:28:06] <+chosenjuan42> You look just enough exp
[3:28:08] <Doctadaking> ‚ÄúI‚Äôve run simulations on the damage. It‚Äôs not good.‚Äù
[3:28:08] <puluxor> MY ANTIDOTE
[3:28:12] <%Superspider51> he's always right he's the god damn Batman
[3:28:13] <Neoripo> Fisting plant time
[3:28:18] <peachy996> Go shoot Wrex, Oracle
[3:28:26] <rytisone> follow the plants
[3:28:26] <+DeChunkandFriends> If Batman can just punch them and destroy them, I don't think these pods are as big of a deal as they think.
[3:28:27] <Asuterisuku> Objective marker says the Mansion.
[3:28:28] <+skyheys> @nabs2099 City is also the worst kind of open world late gen 7 game
[3:28:28] <RWLJr98> I made a simulation ü§ì
[3:28:33] <mudamudajo> Fucking plant assholes protruding from the ground.
[3:28:35] <%saladin1911> Oracle really just exists to force Batman to say something during down time lmao
[3:28:38] <masterfire23> man arkham city aged better than I expected
[3:28:46] <dinnydanny777> @themanwhoshot That makes sense, but my point was more that he's a genius but he's also a massively arrogant egotist so he might just be lying
[3:28:51] <MinersLoveGames> So do you think Ivy feels it every time Batman fists one of her plants?
[3:28:55] <+nabs2099> @skyheys Why do you say that? I like it far more than most open worlds
[3:29:01] <%i_heart_gaming> lmao
[3:29:04] <Asuterisuku> @Minerslovegames Yes.
[3:29:09] <RWLJr98> @minerslovegames she does
[3:29:09] <+DoktorZee> REMOTE
[3:29:09] <%i_heart_gaming> @Minerslovegames lolololol
[3:29:11] <%jonblnt> mid punch
[3:29:12] <leith_aziz> @saladin1911 Would you prefer a narrator constantly ? (dont take my question as serious)
[3:29:15] <peachy996> @saladin1911 Pretty much which is why I'm glad Alfred took over in City
[3:29:15] <@Solidus_113> double back, or remote
[3:29:16] <Doctadaking> Purchase a middle stick
[3:29:16] <%emptyantics> Ivy cooming after he fits them Kappa
[3:29:20] <@Solidus_113> bat*
[3:29:20] <R3c0n31> i like he could just take his own "non-lethal" explosion's
[3:29:24] <+Superbro64> Oracle: "Look at this cool fog simulation I made in blender. Shit took hours to render"
[3:29:27] <%aram909> @nabs2099 really bad map, 500 fucking riddler trophies, lot of haphazard scattershot design rather than the tight focus of this game
[3:29:36] <leith_aziz> I think City aged well for an open world game
[3:29:44] <peachy996> It's just for fun really
[3:29:47] <%X2Eliah> DIAGONALLOS
[3:29:49] <%aram909> City aged very poorly imo
[3:29:53] <+MightyDuckShoes> great Ivy just turned Arkham into a giant "back massager."
[3:29:55] <peachy996> Mildly useful in Pred rooms
[3:29:56] <@Solidus_113> audio loop
[3:29:58] <%emptyantics> @superbro64 ‚ÄúI remade all of Silent Hill on blender!‚Äù
[3:30:01] <Doctadaking> Woolie, guide it back into your hand
[3:30:02] <+skyheys> @nabs2099 Ran terribly at launch, tons of collectibles for the sake of them, terrible combat and bosses, streamlined level design in order to facilitate said open world and the assets within it, etc
[3:30:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Makes no sense
[3:30:05] <R3c0n31> hit yourself with it
[3:30:05] <BlackermanZX> VERY far
[3:30:07] <leith_aziz> The riddler stuff is annoying, but the Map doesnt feel empty ans has its seperate distinct districts
[3:30:09] <RWLJr98> @aram909 wrong opinion!
[3:30:10] <+condemned_15> so many puzzles for that in City
[3:30:12] <+Undenizen> this thing can solve a lot of problems
[3:30:13] <Neoripo> Hit yourself
[3:30:13] <Iwashi94> don't think about how it works
[3:30:15] <BlackermanZX> hit yourself with it LUL
[3:30:16] <+chosenjuan42> throw it at yourself
[3:30:18] <Asuterisuku> It's a useful tool, it gets much more useful in the next game.
[3:30:18] <TheManWhosHot> @dinnydanny777 Thats true, whenever he's against bats he seems to become more egotistical
[3:30:18] <+Shonen_hero> dronearang
[3:30:20] <TheWizardOfWordplay> fun to use in city
[3:30:25] <radar410> @aram909 Arkham City to this day has one of the best open worlds imo.
[3:30:25] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[3:30:30] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[3:30:31] <+Katohearts> Antipuzzle batarang
[3:30:35] <TheWizardOfWordplay> counts the same as a batarang
[3:30:36] <%invader_rin> Simple
[3:30:39] <Asuterisuku> I mean, Riddler was already a problem.
[3:30:40] <%Dakuu75> "nothing that simple" was that a joke?
[3:30:41] <%RyTYoung> Two Face is simple LUL
[3:30:42] <+MightyDuckShoes> splooosh
[3:30:43] <%aram909> @radar410 nah
[3:30:46] <brachydios777> Cut to Batman Ninja
[3:30:46] <+GenesisKnight> "Some kind of giant Joker robot?!"
[3:30:48] <dekkitout> Mecha Joker would be a nice change in pace
[3:30:48] <mighty_fine_trousers> only use is for puzzles right?
[3:30:50] <+DomunDomunDomun> Green water missed because of detective mode.
[3:30:51] <Daveythe6thMoon> "Nothing that simple." F#*kin' Batman.
[3:30:51] <+Exicuren> Humblebrag Batman
[3:30:56] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @HollowMan190
[3:30:56] <%aram909> its the ubisoft assassins creed design of just making a giant checklist
[3:30:56] <+Javaa01> @mighty_fine_trousers Yeah
[3:30:59] <radar410> @aram909 Which ones would you say are better?
[3:31:02] <%i_heart_gaming> technically two face doesn't have any super strength right
[3:31:03] <%krispen_wa> Mecha Joker would have been an actual decent boss
[3:31:03] <@Solidus_113> Mecha Joker like Batman Ninja
[3:31:04] <sunnythedrunk> The all nighter is starting to get to her
[3:31:04] <%aram909> of things to do with no way to actually interact with the world
[3:31:05] <heart_ablaze> legi batman anyone
[3:31:07] <leith_aziz> This track is great
[3:31:11] <Rubecks> is the giant joker robot a thing? LUL
[3:31:14] <peachy996> Music are you okay?
[3:31:14] <%ChoculaUltra> "Oracle, Joker got in the Eva."
[3:31:15] <heart_ablaze> lego*
[3:31:17] <Doctadaking> I like the Arkham City open world. Feels like a giant playground
[3:31:26] <brachydios777> Look up Batman Ninja
[3:31:29] <TheManWhosHot> man, music really does alot for this game
[3:31:30] <SixthShinx> monkaS
[3:31:35] <+nabs2099> @aram909 True but it also had the best story and side quests, the riddlee missions were actually SUPER fun and also it was actually easy to memorize where everything was because the map wasn't needlessly gigantic.
[3:31:36] <%LastHazzerd> "Safe"
[3:31:36] <radar410> @aram909 Riddler trophies aren't even close to being the game's main focus though, unlike Ubisoft's side content
[3:31:37] <dekkitout> OF COURSE lT DOES
[3:31:38] <Shardlab> @i_heart_gaming Two Face has no super powers, he's just competent, but nuts
[3:31:41] <$LightningLynx89> Poison he resevoir
[3:31:41] <%i_heart_gaming> work faster hot wheels
[3:31:42] <gunsrlove> Poison the water with Steroids
[3:31:48] <dinnydanny777> Why would they design this place like this NotLikeThis
[3:31:50] <%aram909> @nabs2099 the side quests were good but the story was godawful
[3:31:50] <penitentpendant> Praise the Metroidvania
[3:31:54] <mudamudajo> woolieSHOOK
[3:31:57] <+Story_Ark> also arkham city introduced gliding around the city which is one of my fave things
[3:31:57] <Asuterisuku> Can't go that way.
[3:31:58] <dekkitout> Always with the poisoning of the waterways
[3:31:59] <+Exicuren> Batman non stop fisting plants
[3:31:59] <+Superbro64> HE POISONED THE WATER HOLE
[3:32:04] <%aram909> not gonna go into spoilers here but none of the arkham games had good stories except for origins and part of arkham knight
[3:32:07] <sleepy_pixels> Gotham has a very supervillan freindly design
[3:32:09] <jaysondeez> the thrilla in manila?
[3:32:11] <+skyheys> @aram909 Xenoblade X, Saboteur, Zelda, etc
[3:32:19] <%Deft_Thought> How is Bat's sure that punching these mutated plants and subsequently bursting them ain't gonna kill him?
[3:32:22] <+Shonen_hero> why does this place have like Skyrim style cave ruins
[3:32:27] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @aram909 no people don't wanna hear the truth
[3:32:27] <leith_aziz> City ? I dont think the story was awful. It had a ton of great moments, but sometimes they dont connect well
[3:32:27] <%saladin1911> @aram909 There's a bunch of important side quests that get you interacting with his loose rogue gallery tho. That's not remotely close to Ubi design
[3:32:33] <$LightningLynx89> @aram909 How can you be brave, yet so wrong.
[3:32:34] <leith_aziz> Also the ending is fantastic
[3:32:35] <jaysondeez> I think the scan says to pop their core
[3:32:37] <Doctadaking> The Arkham games have great story moments, but the overall plots can get a little lost
[3:32:43] <TheManWhosHot> personally I think Knight and City had the best stories, tho Knight got a bit weird at times
[3:32:45] <peachy996> It wont
[3:32:48] <sunnythedrunk> but what if it does
[3:32:50] <KnightAsteran> videogame rule of 3 baybee
[3:32:50] <maskeddudej> city of bane 0 Kappa
[3:32:52] <frostyjay3> I really like the idea of a Riddler trophy just chilling there, out in the open
[3:32:53] <+nabs2099> @skyheys Freeflow combat is rad though. the bosses have always been shit, City had better bosses than any of the other games except maybe Origins. Also I played on Xbox so no launch issues.
[3:32:55] <%krispen_wa> origin had best story
[3:32:56] <arcade0416> knight had good story CONCEPTS, but terrible execution
[3:32:58] <%ChoculaUltra> dammit Bats thats not an answer
[3:33:00] <peachy996> Batman is very fond of shutting the What if scenarios
[3:33:03] <+Superbro64> but what if batman, what *if*
[3:33:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1369188817492656132?s=19
[3:33:04] <Laironx3> "but waht if..." it won't!
[3:33:04] <Ultimatefool> Gotham? Did they mean ARkham?
[3:33:12] <RWLJr98> Careful to not say spoilers
[3:33:16] <+Story_Ark> I think Knight's story would be so much more well recieved if they were more honest about its "spoiler"
[3:33:17] <dukenux> Asylum story is very basic, but it gets the job done

[3:35:36] <%i_heart_gaming> the good ol 1 two
[3:35:40] <dukenux> sure
[3:35:41] <leith_aziz> How I see it ? Asylum: Basic story but executed well. City: Some stuff dont really connect well (Sometimes it feels like the game wants to introduce as many villians as it can) But there's alot of stuff that makes an impact without spoiling, ending especially.
[3:35:44] <peachy996> Run away from the secrets map
[3:35:47] <%krispen_wa> MIND GOBLINS

[3:36:10] <Laironx3> Mind goblins colorized 2009
[3:36:14] <dukenux> Yeah, but Joker's bat-obsessed
[3:36:15] <DatAsuna> Joker is playing 5 nights at freddies
[3:36:16] <Doctadaking> Nah, he gets off on the idea of Batman stumbling around aimlessly
[3:36:16] <RWLJr98> He loves it
[3:36:21] <+Superbro64> @mudamudajo bruh
[3:36:21] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine leaving shit around for batman to find that he might not even find
[3:36:23] <dekkitout> I'm sure he has teppen pulled up on another screen
[3:36:23] <penitentpendant> I'd suppose The Riddler is pretty bored in jail otherwise
[3:36:23] <+Exicuren> But joker, tho
[3:36:23] <+Who_lio42> has woolie gone to THE TV room at all?
[3:36:24] <+Shonen_hero> Joker is not a fun guy tbf
[3:36:26] <marrowjuice> eddie loves it

[3:36:32] <+asgard147> you asume these people are sane woolie
[3:36:32] <+chiazam> Its Joker's fetish
[3:36:33] <TheManWhosHot> Joker is probably watching youtube
[3:36:34] <Neoripo> Nigma is a weirdo
[3:36:35] <cosmicgoatee> Joker just wants anarchy and chill
[3:36:35] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Joker probably finds this the most fun part of the gig
[3:36:37] <balthazar758> @mudamudajo joker is that kind of guy
[3:36:42] <+Undenizen> I like to imagine a lot of stuff batman just never encounters

[3:36:59] <sleepy_pixels> I imagine it's like watching people play a game you made

[3:37:35] <Skul1b3ard> Yeah Croc's voice in this is very "do your best mean monster voice, Dad!"
[3:37:35] <leith_aziz> Origin: Plays it safe, but the Bane sections were great. Batman also has an arc, but the only issue is that its a prequel so you know how its gonna pan out.

[3:47:08] <%agoaj> I do not understand woolie's intentions with the sonic batarang, is he trying to make it harder?
[3:47:11] <leith_aziz> @arcade0416 Its biggest flaw is that it plays it safe. But it has a lot of good shit
[3:47:12] <TheManWhosHot> scaring the goons shitless is easily the best part of the game for me
[3:47:14] <+Veraverse> Everything. Is. Blue.

[3:47:46] <Asuterisuku> I bet you could do something cool from under that room.
[3:47:46] <%cubbywolf> imagine if you started as penguins henchmen and batman just kept beating you up as you cant find work because of hospital bills and jail time and so you consecutively run up the villian ladder before working for joker

[3:52:30] <peachy996> the reason why he doesn't do a particular thing we know how to do is because Woolie has not figured it out

[4:00:38] <%i_heart_gaming> Remember, this is not a prison THIS IS AN ASYLUM.
[4:00:41] <kazadaz> Annoyingly they changed how knife guys work in city (for the better, at least)
[4:00:43] <peachy996> Is it coming up?
[4:00:45] <leith_aziz> Joker is getting salty

[4:01:13] <+Veraverse> Damn
[4:01:14] <T_Sasquatch> Joker's constant voice overs reminds me of how bad pagan min was
[4:01:15] <zepelinnn1> deja vu
[4:01:16] <+MugenSandan> you know Batman using the Sekiro system would be PRETTY GOOD
[4:01:16] <fangovafang> A new venom game wud be dope right now
[4:01:24] <rlayers> Joker Puzzle!
[4:01:26] <majindusto> With Joker...It's always a Threat
[4:01:26] <puluxor> Shit' serious when The Joker doesn't tell ajoke asakuraSweat
[4:01:27] <Neoripo> Joker getting angry
[4:01:27] <peachy996> Still exp
[4:01:27] <Asuterisuku> Woolie you were here earlier though.
[4:01:29] <SainEdge> Reggie with the eagle eyes
[4:01:32] <brachydios777> R.E.G System at work
[4:01:32] <leith_aziz> @T_Sasquatch I thought he stole the show ?
[4:01:33] <%saladin1911> 200XP tho
[4:01:33] <+nabs2099> @t_sasquatch pagan Minh was great
[4:01:34] <+DoktorZee> not useless thats exp baby!
[4:01:38] <Doctadaking> Has Riddler stopped talking shit. I haven‚Äôt heard from him in ages
[4:01:38] <coreybom> @i_heart_gaming Well, they did point out that they had to transfer blackgate goons there. Blackgate went up in flames.
[4:01:40] <dukenux> was there a Venom game?
[4:01:40] <KaiserMario> 200 XP isn't bad
[4:01:42] <+BlueEyesWhiteFatass> how did he get it back there tho
[4:01:45] <+1spidersymbiotepool> watching woolie struggle with the bladed enemies constantly makes me wonder how much he would struggle in Arkham city enemy types
[4:01:49] <+SolidusRex> Pretty sneaky sis
[4:01:51] <leith_aziz> Normally, you WANT to hear more Pagan Min
[4:01:51] <heart_ablaze> joker is every retail managers wet dream
[4:01:52] <majindusto> JOKER PUZZLE STILL enigmaKEK
[4:01:56] <penitentpendant> That would be a legit way to piss off Riddler, "Man, look at all these JOKER puzzles everywhere."
[4:01:58] <+allups> aye ur ganna want that whn u go for the platinum
[4:02:00] <kazadaz> eh, I reckon City explains its mechanics better
[4:02:15] <kazadaz> which is good, cause there's way more of them
[4:02:16] <Neoripo> True LUL
[4:02:17] <Doctadaking> City has much better tutorials
[4:02:22] <peachy996> He'd still struggle with Assassins
[4:02:27] <SainEdge> LUL
[4:02:29] <T_Sasquatch> @leith_aziz @nabs2099 yes on screen he was great but he's mostly relegated to a voice talking shit once every like 5 missions
[4:02:30] <thunka10> LUL
[4:02:34] <dukenux> @penitentpendant "Damn, those Joker puzzles REALLY test my intellect"
[4:02:36] <peachy996> And City does help you out more you guys are right
[4:02:38] <Asuterisuku> citiOS vibes.
[4:02:38] <+vaporousTippler> Does OMAC run on 5G?
[4:02:38] <+Veraverse> Unfortunately City doesn't shut up with the puzzles
[4:02:39] <chili_nobeans> Batman plays the PS Vita more than anyone I know
[4:02:41] <+UnwoundCaesar70> yes of course i already got my vaccine
[4:02:42] <@Menitta> Alfred, I can FEEL THE SIGNALS
[4:02:45] <arcade0416> riddler is using his 6G technology to give everyone riddle-brain, batman!!!
[4:02:46] <%krispen_wa> ORACLE, HACK THE 5G TOWERS FOR CORONA
[4:02:48] <mighty_fine_trousers> Bat G like the Bat Credit Card
[4:02:49] <leith_aziz> @T_Sasquatch I wish he appeared more ONscreen
[4:02:50] <+vanareus> OMAC are for sure 5g
[4:02:51] <huskarl_zap> Sending them the cancer at a incredible speed.
[4:02:55] <%emptyantics> 5G Radiates from his bat horns
[4:02:56] <leith_aziz> Instead of OFFscreen
[4:02:59] <dukenux> "I told Fox to install 5G in every phone in Gotham"
[4:03:02] <dinnydanny777> Batman would totally spy on everybody in Gotham limesHmm
[4:03:04] <+GenesisKnight> OMAC
[4:03:06] <kazadaz> Q says Bruce Wayne got replaced by an impersonater last May, see how the new guy has these stitches on his chin?

[4:03:10] <Neoripo> CityOS is real
[4:03:11] <brachydios777> LUL
[4:03:11] <T_Sasquatch> Hard to take a villain seriously when he's just a walkie talkie voice for 90% of the game
[4:03:12] <penitentpendant> @dukenux Riddler, the most likely batman villain to go "REEEEE!"
[4:03:13] <peachy996> Here's the bad time
[4:03:15] <+vanareus> ah yes, best boss
[4:03:15] <leith_aziz> Plan ahead !
[4:03:17] <dukenux> HE ALREADY DID IN TDK

[4:11:13] <Asuterisuku> There we go.
[4:11:15] <+nabs2099> @themanwhoshot eh give him a break. he's probably voiced so many characters by this point lol
[4:11:15] <frostyjay3> @cosmicgoatee Matt Mercer voices Majima in like a Dragon. Mark Hamil did the voice in the English dub of the PS2 version of Yakuza 1

[4:12:05] <Asuterisuku> Don't think about how the cable just splits into 3 at Bruce's hand.
[4:12:06] <AhmCha> what if one of those falling rocks just crushed his head
[4:12:06] <penitentpendant> @cubbywolf Of course, because it's too useful to keep off but drowns the color pallette

[4:12:44] <peachy996> Riddler is hoping you'll do it all after you beat the main story lol
[4:12:46] <Jaysky> That's what she said- er, she thinks
[4:12:54] <$doomerskeletor13> Are y‚Äôall gonna beat this tonight? You‚Äôre getting kind of close iirc
[4:12:55] <DatAsuna> Remember riddler race tracks?
[4:12:57] <Daveythe6thMoon> That's what she thinks cause it's true, Bats.
[4:12:57] <Asuterisuku> You DO have the tools to find that riddle now, but it is what it is.
[4:12:59] <plaguedoctor_syan> I mean not giving attetion to the Ridller is the worst thing you can do to him
[4:12:59] <T_Sasquatch> What a long series of events IN ONE NIGHT
[4:13:02] <penitentpendant> @cubbywolf They'd probably have to iterate a different vision mode entirely. Brief highlighting or something.

[4:18:23] <%cubbywolf> for such a loud bang and screen damage it sure doesnt do much atual damage
[4:18:25] <+FuqBoiSlim> Joker is a Sigma Male
[4:18:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> Joker not a Nigma-male confirmed
[4:18:26] <%LastHazzerd> ironic since she has a thing for Harley
[4:18:27] <%cubbywolf> gotta hit the head mang
[4:18:28] <+Veraverse> For real tho, Arkham Series has some lines that didn't aged well. Like sexism and transphobia
[4:18:31] <Asuterisuku> Nice goggles on that guy.
[4:18:32] <%Mattais88> You know, Ivy could make such a killing as a drug lord.
[4:18:36] <TheManWhosHot> Possible brain damage caused, but hey he's not dead

[4:19:13] <arcade0416> joker is just mad bc he hasn't gotten a kiss from batman yet
[4:19:17] <cosmicgoatee> Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope have been real quiet since the last Joker takeover
[4:19:18] <mighty_fine_trousers> He can accelerate the batarang right?
[4:19:19] <Iwashi94> are the plants just an optional checklist?
[4:19:21] <+Veraverse> @t_sasquatch some goon dialogue makes fun of the idea that Harley Queen may have a penis in City
[4:19:22] <Dante_Namikaze1> @veraverse are you sure why the transphobia bit
[4:19:24] <dukenux> well Joker being sexist is not a surprise, cause hes abusive towards Harley in most iterations i think
[4:19:30] <orochisdayoff> LUL that plant punching sound effect
[4:19:32] <penitentpendant> Yeah, the giant plant rising on the side of the island is really missable in detective mode, unfortunately
[4:19:38] <TheyCallMeVawn> ???
[4:19:42] <iLike_femboys> @Veraverse lol that was a funny line
[4:19:47] <T_Sasquatch> @veraverse that's so random LUL
[4:19:50] <penitentpendant> Yet even then, I kept it on
[4:19:53] <Asuterisuku> Just the big POP as Bruce pulls his hand out.

[4:20:19] <+nabs2099> @veraverse Specific dialogue or just how characters are handled? Cos I agree w sexism, I didn't notice transphobia, but also I wasn't as well versed in that stuff back when I played the games. I'm defos not a fan of how none of the women get to be anything other than damsels or super sexual "cum and see Batman uwu" type chicks.

[4:20:50] <+Veraverse> @nabs2099 just goon dialogue. Nothing from the main campaign

[4:30:43] <sunnythedrunk> All this moaning and we didn't even get a Zone animation
[4:30:43] <arcade0416> this is a good boss! it's very simple but i think it works, especially in the second stage
[4:30:43] <SheefEatsBeef> you wanted a boss that wasn't run at you and throw batarang... i guess
[4:30:45] <+taggerung403> Thats not a saying
[4:30:48] <Fetty_Krill> She literally just opens up the plant to laugh and mock Batman. If she didn't ever open up she could just win. LUL
[4:30:51] <+AWKWARDL0SER> What is she even shooting at you?
[4:30:51] <%akuda_bar> who catches bats in traps
[4:30:55] <+allups> so is the massive play always there or did she manifest it
[4:30:55] <%krispen_wa> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:30:58] <santafer> Dead Space
[4:31:01] <+allups> plant*
[4:31:02] <+Veraverse> This is the best boss, look at the voice acting
[4:31:05] <HelluvaNohbody> I'm sure those moans were used for something
[4:31:06] <+skyheys> ITS SO BAD
[4:31:09] <peachy996> Give in to the Chemicals, Batman
[4:31:09] <+chosenjuan42> Fightfuck or Fuckfight?
[4:31:10] <+Superbro64> "bat in a trap" bruh wtf does that even *mean*
[4:31:10] <%cubbywolf> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:31:11] <sunnythedrunk> EPIC BOSS FIGHT
[4:31:11] <dukenux> its good because she atleast does something different
[4:31:12] <leith_aziz> I think this boss is "ok", but that doesnt make me like it either
[4:31:14] <%akuda_bar> awkward boss fight to watch without headphones
[4:31:16] <+nabs2099> This is so stupid omg
[4:31:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Darren716 Ok we're gonna need 3 evil chuckles and 3 overtly sexual hurt sounds
[4:31:18] <T_Sasquatch> She's literally just opening to laugh at you
[4:31:18] <arcade0416> that IS another good point in origin's favor, though -- it has the best boss fights in the series
[4:31:24] <%NorthGrizzly> It is better that Big boy run
[4:31:25] <Meltgar> Doesnt it do tiny bit of damage to the closed pod?
[4:31:25] <santafer> Pound her flower
[4:31:27] <%PapaGravestone> @Lancaster_H Kreygasm I need extraction
[4:31:27] <leith_aziz> @arcade0416 Bingo
[4:31:28] <%cubbywolf> LUL
[4:31:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> Ayo?
[4:31:28] <+Veraverse> BLOWING HER, EH
[4:31:29] <rytisone> blow her
[4:31:29] <Darren716> LUL
[4:31:32] <+taggerung403> No time for bat
[4:31:32] <+NahmenJayden> I liked this boss better in Killer Is Dead
[4:31:32] <penitentpendant> One of the rare times he doesn't make a bat symbol
[4:31:33] <+AWKWARDL0SER> She went limp
[4:31:33] <Darren716> Did he sign his name?
[4:31:34] <+Mr_Misanthropy> He wrote GG ez
[4:31:35] <Doctadaking> No bat symbol? Lame
[4:31:35] <waffleandman> you thought it was over! 2 more times LUL
[4:31:36] <+allups> the moans really makes this boss fight not age well
[4:31:36] <%krispen_wa> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:31:37] <+mundanelotus> what did he weite?
[4:31:38] <+funya_rinpa> wow, that shit is tough
[4:31:38] <T_Sasquatch> We dmc4ing
[4:31:39] <%cubbywolf> Round 2 FIGHT
[4:31:41] <Asuterisuku> Now for phase 2.
[4:31:41] <arcade0416> second stage!!!
[4:31:43] <heart_ablaze> NOT DEAD
[4:31:43] <TheManWhosHot> padding
[4:31:43] <majindusto> Is this the Horniest Boss Fight ever?
[4:31:46] <+paladinstarbuster> ADS
[4:31:46] <santafer> She kinda looks like Jessie from Team Rocket here
[4:31:46] <+StooEsq> he didn't spray a bat logo time
[4:31:46] <DatAsuna> perhaps 3 times
[4:31:47] <Doctadaking> ADDDDDS
[4:31:47] <+DoktorZee> again!
[4:31:47] <xeros720> you got your hp back
[4:31:48] <dinnydanny777> This plant looks like a penis limesHmm
[4:31:48] <AvroEltz> GOOOONS
[4:31:48] <+GenesisKnight> Phase 2
[4:31:48] <%saladin1911> Shit... Chat. I may need to take a minute. ahem
[4:31:49] <BlackermanZX> Oh man LUL
[4:31:49] <%emptyantics> @arcade0416 Origins has some of the best boss fights in all the series
[4:31:51] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @skyheys
[4:31:51] <+DeChunkandFriends> At least you heal between phases
[4:31:52] <rlayers> second base
[4:31:54] <Futurecity10> Cheer500 Sup woolie, I finally saved enough to be able to buy a high end computer. I was going to go through artisian, but after consulting with a lot of people I just got frustrated and gave up. Why do computers have to be like this.
[4:31:54] <%Mrbaconator> perhaps 3 times
[4:31:56] <Daveythe6thMoon> Now we have plants AND goons!
[4:31:58] <sunnythedrunk> 3 times an easter egg Kappa
[4:32:02] <mankeymania> round 2 of fuck fight
[4:32:03] <+skyheys> FUCK YEAH FILLER
[4:32:05] <%Afterman_> that dude died
[4:32:06] <DXLelouch24> RULE OF 3 FOOLS
[4:32:07] <Asuterisuku> NOT DEAD
[4:32:08] <puluxor> Now imagine this on Hard tyrantBruh
[4:32:13] <dukenux> Do you have the stamina? Kappa
[4:32:15] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Hope you brought blue chew
[4:32:16] <Doctadaking> Those guys fell into the hentai pit
[4:32:16] <waffleandman> 3 times video game rule
[4:32:20] <+nabs2099> @skyheys Lmao this fight was totally filler
[4:32:25] <+BigBlackBankai> OH YOU TOUCH MY TREE LALA
[4:32:26] <%emptyantics> DID HE SPELL COOM
[4:32:27] <xeros720> i think if you have all the batarang upgrades, this'll actually go pretty fast
[4:32:30] <+funya_rinpa> The absolute madmen gave her a phase 2 with zero change to her moveset
[4:32:38] <+Veraverse> Eh?
[4:32:38] <dukenux> MMM MY DING DING DONG
[4:32:39] <BlackermanZX> BOOO
[4:32:40] <T_Sasquatch> I don't remember this fight at all
[4:32:40] <%krispen_wa> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:32:41] <RealDurdyDan> @puluxor It actually wasn't too difficult
[4:32:42] <leith_aziz> @xeros720 Yep tripple batarangs in combos
[4:32:43] <Meltgar> 2nd LIFEBAR?!
[4:32:44] <Komayeda> No Killing, huh.
[4:32:45] <chaos4ever181> did he get to THAT moment yet?
[4:32:47] <TheManWhosHot> @LynbellDaYo they added her onlyfans subs wdym
[4:32:48] <brachydios777> BOOOOOO
[4:32:49] <Iwashi94> isn't there another fight with Ivy or am I thinking of City?
[4:32:49] <+skyheys> @nabs2099 "We made these assets, better use em for at least ten minutes"
[4:32:50] <arcade0416> i'd ask why she keeps opening her shield but to be fair she's probably not in her right mind right now
[4:32:52] <penitentpendant> Ah yes, the Tier 3 Subs Phase
[4:32:52] <Doctadaking> I mean, at least the boss looks cool
[4:32:52] <stormhawk9891> THAT GUYS DEAD
[4:32:53] <fancypanzer> extended boss fighting pleasure
[4:32:54] <Lancaster_H> they just wanted to record more voicelines
[4:32:57] <Daveythe6thMoon> "NO KILLING"
[4:32:57] <+panlakes> it's not the worst fight in asylum
[4:33:03] <dukenux> RULES OF NATURE
[4:33:07] <@Solidus_113> it's at least different
[4:33:07] <peachy996> No thats coming up lol
[4:33:08] <+chosenjuan42> she sending simps to defeat you
[4:33:11] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie?
[4:33:11] <ihavesillyknees> OOOOH I FIGURED OUT WHY HER BOSS IS LIKE THIS. They didn't want Bats to punch a lady
[4:33:12] <+skyheys> "I am so strong-OHHHHHHH"
[4:33:12] <HolyGriddles> GOON SIMPS
[4:33:14] <leith_aziz> @Iwashi94 With Catwoman, but its not really a boss fight
[4:33:15] <+FuqBoiSlim> I straight up forgot Ivy was in Asylum. I thought she was only in City
[4:33:15] <gunsrlove> IVY PLEASE
[4:33:15] <+paladinstarbuster> wow reggie
[4:33:15] <Komayeda> That's the Batman Way. When they open up, shut 'em down.
[4:33:17] <+allups> what reggie
[4:33:17] <+Veraverse> REGGIE NO
[4:33:19] <restingbones> ... daugther?
[4:33:19] <TheManWhosHot> Chat who's Ivy voice actress, asking for a friend
[4:33:25] <+nabs2099> Every villainess in Arkham just oozes sex. Every single word they speak, and movement they do. and I swear it makes me more uncomfortable than anything else.
[4:33:31] <mudamudajo> Fuck mother nature! IMMA RICH INDUSTRIALIST!!!
[4:33:31] <mankeymania> what are you doing step bat?
[4:33:32] <%isa_sensei96> isa_sensei96 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[4:33:33] <+allups> reggie sometime u say some shit
[4:33:34] <+skyheys> @ihavesillyknees Same reason she doesn't become a nasty monster too
[4:33:35] <iLike_femboys> i would have prefered if they used mad hatter instead of ivy
[4:33:37] <Meltgar> @ihavesillyknees But the HANDS of justice is unisex Kappa
[4:33:41] <Darren716> FuqBoiSlim Weird because she has a much smaller role in city
[4:33:42] <%saladin1911> LUL
[4:33:43] <+Story_Ark> daughter?
[4:33:45] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Don‚Äôt call her daughter you‚Äôre not fit to, the picture kept with remind you
[4:33:46] <dukenux> LUL
[4:33:47] <dinnydanny777> She picks up her own guys limesHmm
[4:33:48] <arcade0416> @ihavesillyknees i'm not sure that's it bc you punch a lot of women in arkham city. mostly ninja ladies
[4:33:50] <peachy996> @nabs2099 Not Lady Shiva
[4:33:50] <+BigBlackBankai> DC Coomics
[4:33:52] <+Solanero> the bat-daddy
[4:33:54] <+nabs2099> @allups what did Reggie say I missed it
[4:33:57] <dukenux> lets sandbag that
[4:34:06] <BlackermanZX> that guy is so dead
[4:34:10] <%NorthGrizzly> Wayne Industury is more Medical and Construction
[4:34:13] <DatAsuna> bringing in adds is just admission that the fight fucks tbh
[4:34:14] <devanmuse> i see he's still playing, and at the only good boss fight in the game
[4:34:19] <+Calamity2007> @iLike_femboys At least Hatter is in Origins and Knight
[4:34:20] <+allups> called ivy his daughter @nabs2099
[4:34:28] <iLike_femboys> @Calamity2007 he is dlc in knight
[4:34:31] <Jaysky> This ain't a good boss
[4:34:34] <+paladinstarbuster> he did it
[4:34:37] <leith_aziz> @nabs2099 I dont know what to tell you other than focus on the stuff you like. I just try to see the more positive side of things (though im not saying this is neccessarily good)
[4:34:39] <+nabs2099> @allups that's... weird...
[4:34:40] <T_Sasquatch> Good LUL
[4:34:44] <+FuqBoiSlim> @darren716 True. it might be also the fact that City was my first bamham
[4:34:46] <+PlatinumRevol> down to the wire
[4:34:52] <orochisdayoff> jesus this boss fight is long LUL
[4:34:54] <%saladin1911> This boss fight is super boring
[4:34:54] <Dante_Namikaze1> @ilike_femboys he's also in city
[4:34:58] <Chester_goes_Berserk> is it meant to be this long? this is dragging
[4:34:59] <rytisone> Simps from hell
[4:35:02] <SixthShinx> F
[4:35:02] <%PapaGravestone> So apparently Ivy's voice actress also plays Martha Wayne in the series WutFace
[4:35:03] <devanmuse> it's not a big brute bullfighter boss. i call that a win
[4:35:04] <TheManWhosHot> MAGIC PIXEL
[4:35:05] <T_Sasquatch> Oh dear
[4:35:05] <%aurasviel> ‚ÄúYou cannot beat mother na-‚Äú Kreygasm
[4:35:09] <Jaysky> Time to start from scratch
[4:35:09] <%cubbywolf> F
[4:35:09] <Darren716> Fair, was my first one too, and I played city a lot more than Asylum myself
[4:35:09] <+nabs2099> @leith_aziz I still love Arkham don't get me wrong. it's just funny.
[4:35:09] <+Veraverse> This fight is long, and it's hell on hard
[4:35:10] <+PlatinumRevol> NOOOOO
[4:35:11] <Doctadaking> I heard you, Blum!
[4:35:11] <cosmicgoatee> F
[4:35:11] <Iwashi94> F
[4:35:12] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[4:35:12] <TheManWhosHot> damn
[4:35:13] <leith_aziz> @nabs2099: I think Shiva in Origins is pretty cool
[4:35:13] <Darren716> F
[4:35:14] <+Mr_Misanthropy> ez clap
[4:35:14] <rlayers> F
[4:35:14] <waffleandman> this boss sucks LUL
[4:35:14] <dukenux> THE HAMMER OF JUSTICE IS UNISEX
[4:35:15] <Darren716> Choked
[4:35:16] <OverlordedK> choked

[4:35:16] <puluxor> tyrantPain tyrantPain tyrantPain
[4:35:17] <Asuterisuku> gdqRipUrn
[4:35:17] <arcade0416> baited
[4:35:17] <ihavesillyknees> This boss is eh...
[4:35:19] <+funya_rinpa> How does City fare with its boss battles? I was planning on checking it out after this LP.
[4:35:21] <brachydios777> Shit
[4:35:22] <+paladinstarbuster> god woolie
[4:35:22] <+Veraverse> WOOLIE...
[4:35:24] <TheWizardOfWordplay> whatever happened to that game where you play as a moderator for a cam girl?
[4:35:24] <ihavesillyknees> I do not like the boss
[4:35:25] <dinnydanny777> Hey nice pun
[4:35:25] <cosmicgoatee> CBT
[4:35:27] <+Mr_Misanthropy> worth it
[4:35:27] <+paladinstarbuster> the man
[4:35:28] <TheManWhosHot> Put on some pants Ivy
[4:35:29] <%Mattais88> HAve to that all over again?
[4:35:30] <Jaysky> From the top
[4:35:31] <+taggerung403> Is that a thing?
[4:35:32] <+Veraverse> "No ass, 4/10" -Woolie.
[4:35:32] <NeoseekerStitch> Sniper Wolf. :3
[4:35:32] <+chosenjuan42> @lynbelldayo Way better
[4:35:34] <puluxor> at least you start at Phase 2
[4:35:34] <Asuterisuku> At least it starts on the second phase.
[4:35:35] <+StooEsq> @Calamity2007 I think he's in City, too, for one quick segment
[4:35:35] <+PlatinumRevol> City has the best boss in the series
[4:35:35] <%NorthGrizzly> You kept running into it
[4:35:35] <+mechahendrix> meh
[4:35:35] <Meltgar> What's a way to heal?
[4:35:35] <Doctadaking> You can still batarang her when she‚Äôs not open. It just doesn‚Äôt do as much damage
[4:35:36] <dukenux> batman got chokejerked
[4:35:36] <Komayeda> welp...
[4:35:36] <%ZeeJiggle> thank god.
[4:35:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PHASE 2 THANK GOODNESS
[4:35:37] <leith_aziz> @LynbellDaYo MUCH BETTER BOSS FIGHTS. Take it from me
[4:35:38] <peachy996> @LynbellDaYo Better than Asylum
[4:35:41] <arcade0416> @LynbellDaYo a lot better than this game by far. especially mr. freeze and ra's
[4:35:42] <RealDurdyDan> If you can dodge that attack you're golden
[4:35:43] <+AWKWARDL0SER> You weren‚Äôt UP to it
[4:35:45] <%Lion_kun> generous
[4:35:45] <xeros720> you know that gameover scene panned down more at one point, but Cert said no
[4:35:48] <sunnythedrunk> City is better in every way and more
[4:35:49] <brachydios777> They knew
[4:35:50] <+StooEsq> nice pun, though
[4:35:51] <penitentpendant> Yeah, playing this game AFTER playing Dark Souls games really messes with the whole 'Dodge Rolls = I-frames' rule that you internalize from that series
[4:35:52] <Meltgar> CHECKPOINT
[4:35:54] <SainEdge> you can still hurt the plant, even if Ivy hasnt open up. it just does less damage
[4:35:58] <leith_aziz> Ra's and Freeze beat any fights from this
[4:36:01] <+StrawberryPantsu> Compelling boss design...
[4:36:01] <+paladinstarbuster> stop running into it
[4:36:08] <sunnythedrunk> But this was their first game so I cut this game a lot of slac
[4:36:09] <mudamudajo> Woolie wants the squeeze
[4:36:09] <%PapaGravestone> wait Ivy is Sniper Wolf too PogChamp
[4:36:10] <jorniev> whats the imput for the combo takedown?
[4:36:18] <leith_aziz> @jorniev Y + B
[4:36:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:36:19] <+mundanelotus> Gotta go for the knockdown after that slow down hit
[4:36:20] <TheManWhosHot> yeah, City just takes Asylum and improves on everything
[4:36:27] <+nabs2099> Argh chokejerking! a sigma's only weakness!
[4:36:29] <%sjay662> Ohhhhhhhh
[4:36:31] <orochisdayoff> kinda feel like Arkham city handled bosses better
[4:36:31] <mighty_fine_trousers> can you dodge cancel the batarang?
[4:36:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> OOOOH Kreygasm
[4:36:38] <leith_aziz> City is an example of how you do a sequel in general
[4:36:43] <+Veraverse> I prefer the metroidvania from Asylum than the open world for the later games, but they are good games
[4:36:43] <BlackermanZX> wheres the bat flamethrower when you need it
[4:36:44] <%aram909> whoa reggie, dark
[4:36:45] <%Lion_kun> OHHH ELDEN RING OHHHHH
[4:36:45] <sunnythedrunk> Arkham City bosses are all pretty good
[4:36:47] <+Veraverse> City slaps hard
[4:36:52] <ihavesillyknees> City is okay, not a fan of the open world.
[4:36:56] <peachy996> That being said there aren't a lot of Boss Fights in City
[4:36:57] <TheManWhosHot> I feel like Origins as well kinda improvs on the gameplay of City
[4:36:57] <feralspidey> you can dodgeroll, throw batarang, dodgeroll throw etc
[4:37:01] <Daveythe6thMoon> Or those Bat-Chainsaws from 'The Batman'.
[4:37:06] <peachy996> OH WAIT! I forgot about Penguin
[4:37:06] <leith_aziz> @Veraverse Both have their stengths and weaknesses. Its fine to like either
[4:37:07] <+allups> didnt someone say this voice actress was sniper wolf
[4:37:09] <penitentpendant> I mean, Mr. Freeze is in City
[4:37:09] <%krispen_wa> why does Ivy's portrait look nothing like Ivy
[4:37:09] <feralspidey> but so far so good
[4:37:14] <%emptyantics> Origins is my personal favorite
[4:37:14] <+chosenjuan42> so when is Petey Piranha X Poison Ivy crossover?
[4:37:15] <+Veraverse> @leith_aziz yeah
[4:37:17] <TheManWhosHot> Knight is by far the superior when it comes to gameplay tho
[4:37:31] <dinnydanny777> I didn't even realize Ivy had a portrait
[4:37:34] <+Veraverse> But fuck Knight's Batmobile
[4:37:39] <ihavesillyknees> Everything after Asylum kind of blends together in my mind.
[4:37:41] <orochisdayoff> @TheManWhosHot Knights the one with all the costumes right?
[4:37:45] <leith_aziz> @TheManWhosHot That is true, but it messes up on a lot of other stuff, so its not the best balance
[4:37:54] <Doctadaking> That‚Äôs portrait is very ‚ÄúMarvel Nemesis‚Äù
[4:38:00] <TheManWhosHot> Knight had alot of costumes ye
[4:38:02] <%krispen_wa> Shadow of War is my favorite Arkham game
[4:38:04] <Komayeda> Well, Knight's batmobile isn't *bad*, but it's definitely a bit overused
[4:38:06] <sunnythedrunk> Knight was excellent but had so many performance issues
[4:38:06] <Asuterisuku> City and Knight both have a decent selection of costume to choose from.
[4:38:09] <dukenux> that guys dead
[4:38:15] <orochisdayoff> ahh thanks
[4:38:17] <T_Sasquatch> I gave on knight after getting it for free because i hate the car shit
[4:38:19] <ihavesillyknees> PS4 Spider-Man is my favorite Arkham Game
[4:38:19] <peachy996> Origins also has some good costumes
[4:38:26] <+nabs2099> @doctadaking Yo Marvel Nemesis was one of the best games EVER
[4:38:28] <+Veraverse> @t_sasquatch same
[4:38:30] <+allups> its so sad that arkham knight has people saying fuck the Batmobile we should wanna get in that shit
[4:38:35] <+chosenjuan42> Origins was way too buggy
[4:38:42] <leith_aziz> in all honestly, ALL Arkham games are good
[4:38:42] <TheManWhosHot> @leith_aziz I think I can forgive it cause its pros far outweight its cons imo
[4:38:47] <%krispen_wa> marvel nemesis was such a dumb fucking game. i fucking love it
[4:38:53] <feralspidey> Quick, someone grab some Roundup!!
[4:38:57] <dinnydanny777> I wonder what she's throwing limesHmm
[4:39:02] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah Arkham as a series is excellent
[4:39:02] <Doctadaking> We wanna get in the batmobile, but not as often as the game wanted us to
[4:39:03] <leith_aziz> @TheManWhosHot Its a good game in the end, but far from my favorite in the franchise
[4:39:05] <+Veraverse> @allups right? The tease from Asylum showing the Batmobile in cutscene only...But the implementation on Knight is so...
[4:39:06] <ingman112> Batmobile in knight handles awesome, feels awesome. It just gets used too much
[4:39:08] <+nabs2099> @allups The batmobile was perfect. the issue was forcing us to have to overuse it so Damn much
[4:39:10] <+teh_rawk> giant plant body dies to a batarang
[4:39:13] <penitentpendant> @chosenjuan42 Isn't it still considered one of the worst Triple-A PC ports of all time?
[4:39:13] <Komayeda> Just keep on orgasmin' Ivy. Keep on keepin' on.
[4:39:16] <+Story_Ark> knight has some FANTASTIC gliding mechanics tho. i pretty much ditched the batmobile cause i wanted to fly instead
[4:39:18] <feralspidey> Marvel Nemesis was Avengers Super Slam, I enjoyed it
[4:39:19] <orochisdayoff> you would think batsy would have a batflamethrower or something
[4:39:23] <arcade0416> i think it would be cool if someone modded THIS game to have the additions of city's engine: beatdowns, reverse batarang, freeflow focus, batswarm, etc.
[4:39:27] <sunnythedrunk> Ivy was really down bad in prison
[4:39:31] <Asuterisuku> RIP that guy.
[4:39:37] <+skyheys> you know a boss fight is good when it starts spamming goons at you
[4:39:39] <rlayers> Nice dodge!
[4:39:42] <feralspidey> that guard just got tossed into the abyss
[4:39:43] <+nabs2099> @feralspidey I miss that game a lot. first time I ever got to play as iron man
[4:39:46] <TheManWhosHot> @leith_aziz second favorite for me personally, its the game that makes you feel like Batman the most which imho is the whole point
[4:39:48] <ihavesillyknees> God this boss is tedious!!!!
[4:39:51] <T_Sasquatch> Oh boy ! Adds !
[4:39:57] <leith_aziz> @TheManWhosHot Allright then
[4:39:59] <+Veraverse> MOANING
[4:40:02] <ihavesillyknees> The Chat is barely talking about what's happening is so boring
[4:40:10] <+nabs2099> Batman came on ivy
[4:40:11] <Iwashi94> It's over Ivy! I have the low ground!
[4:40:13] <Komayeda> KILL HER
[4:40:13] <+taggerung403> no time for bat :(
[4:40:15] <Asuterisuku> Game does it for you in a cutscene so you don't even get to press the button.
[4:40:15] <puluxor> The Z?
[4:40:17] <+nabs2099> Batman explosive cum
[4:40:19] <+Story_Ark> PART 3
[4:40:20] <PWNMAKER> You can quick batarang and chip her health down so easily in this fight
[4:40:20] <fancypanzer> when youre too horny to draw
[4:40:21] <xeros720> they couldn't even think of a 3rd phase
[4:40:21] <DatAsuna> the disrespect

[4:40:38] <+samuraiknack> My mind

[4:41:38] <orochisdayoff> Man Batman deserves a cup of batcoffee and some cronuts after that bossfight
[4:41:39] <+panlakes> so many backseat gamers in chat today
[4:41:40] <%isa_sensei96> Already on the Final Boss?
[4:41:41] <$doomerskeletor13> If they don‚Äôt finish now it‚Äôs gonna be a short ass session next week
[4:41:43] <Darren716> Woolie you got this
[4:41:45] <Asuterisuku> You could have gone there at any point of the game, and it would've given you unique dialogue from Joker.
[4:41:45] <leith_aziz> @pi_in_the_sci Bullshit. Aside from mentioning Origins, you also have Solomon Grundy, Ra's and Final boss
[4:41:47] <+chosenjuan42> This is endgame
[4:41:48] <devanmuse> you can finish it tonight if you go for it. easily, I'd say
[4:41:48] <Doctadaking> Pat already warned him that the final boss is shit
[4:41:48] <+Aeoneth> No seriously... did Batman even inject the antidote? It looked like it just got knocked away
[4:41:48] <+mundanelotus> push it tho
[4:41:49] <%cubbywolf> love this part

[4:42:04] <ihavesillyknees> How much more there is?
[4:42:06] <BlackermanZX> damn we are here huh
[4:42:09] <Dio_TR> basically 30 to 40 min left @ihavesillyknees
[4:42:13] <+BigBlackBankai> There is like half an hour of game left.
[4:42:13] <Asuterisuku> Final Boss time.
[4:42:24] <xeros720> they had a bit too much of the juice
[4:42:26] <%Robot_Nixon_> only 20 minoot
[4:42:27] <sunnythedrunk> How did they survive plantageddon
[4:42:27] <ihavesillyknees> Hmmmm yeah, they can do it.
[4:42:29] <%krispen_wa> wait did woolie ever go inside the TV room?
[4:42:29] <leith_aziz> I just think that saying Freeze is the only good fight in Arkham is bullshit
[4:42:34] <peachy996> @chili_nobeans Pat spoiled so much of it too lol
[4:42:37] <Daveythe6thMoon> Maybe they were invited! They were just too busy screaming to accept the invite!
[4:42:37] <ihavesillyknees> But man... 5 hours, hope they aren't drained
[4:42:46] <Doctadaking> Freeze is the best fight, but he‚Äôs not the only good fight. That‚Äôs absurd
[4:42:46] <+Veraverse> You can do it, Woolie
[4:42:46] <gunsrlove> I need a cigarette after Ivy, phew
[4:42:48] <$doomerskeletor13> City has some good boss fights

[4:42:50] <sunnythedrunk> No city has a lot of good boss fights wtf
[4:42:53] <Dio_TR> YEYEYEYE

[5:02:09] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[5:02:09] <enerkaizer> Him resisting the venom makes sense. batman used venom before and which actually gave him a bit of immunity to the stuff
[5:02:09] <%cubbywolf> WHY STOP THE HYPE WITH A PAUSE?
[5:02:09] <Daveythe6thMoon> Oh, and the Joker suddenly has a mohawk.

[5:02:55] <Asuterisuku> In fact they're DOUBLING DOWN.
[5:02:55] <Komayeda> IN FOR A PENNY
[5:02:55] <dukenux> Joker's trick

[5:02:58] <miucsa51> We came from Bane and to Bane we shall return
[5:02:58] <xeros720> nah, if you wanted that, Joker was a dlc character for challenge rooms
[5:02:58] <+Veraverse> FOR YOU
[5:02:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> only pain
[5:02:59] <+MightyDuckShoes> Joker should have been Vergil
[5:02:59] <dekkitout> It's been Bane all along, Austin
[5:02:59] <restingbones> Nope, this is canon for the series
[5:02:59] <Arancet> you were warned
[5:03:00] <arcade0416> Jokebane: The Man Who Broke The Joke

[5:03:02] <$doomerskeletor13> IT WOULDVE BEEN BETTER IF IT WAS A NIGHTMARE
[5:03:02] <JanusII> Are you not enterBaned!?
[5:03:03] <HolyGriddles> Does it help that Arkham City makes this plot point better? @woolieversus

[5:03:06] <penitentpendant> Never go full BANEr
[5:03:07] <+eanscrale> This is why they wanted to reboot this series huh
[5:03:08] <Daveythe6thMoon> Never go full Bane.
[5:03:08] <sunnythedrunk> They really couldn't do boss fights yet
[5:03:09] <peachy996> But the best thing is this shitty Boss has big consequences in City
[5:03:10] <+DeChunkandFriends> The whole game has been a Scarecrow trip, Woolie. It's okay.
[5:03:10] <+Javaa01> More batarangs who cares
[5:03:11] <SainEdge> they learned their lesson after this bossfight LUL
[5:03:11] <Reveresao> Does batman not have the cape stun in this game? I can;t remember?
[5:03:11] <+allups> same exact enemies like all the others u love it
[5:03:12] <Macabre__> BOKER
[5:03:14] <miucsa51> Absolute Bane
[5:03:14] <TheManWhosHot> But woolie, how are we supposed to fight Joker in a big epic battle then?
[5:03:15] <%CptnCampy61> It was never a good ending
[5:03:15] <leith_aziz> The one good thing I can say is that future games learned from this
[5:03:15] <DatAsuna> @emptyantics skipping is bitch talk
[5:03:16] <feralspidey> I'm amazed you never saw this!
[5:03:17] <+Katohearts> nope

[5:03:39] <+FuqBoiSlim> ITS THE FINAL BANEDOWN
[5:03:39] <BlackermanZX> the Baker
[5:03:41] <+chosenjuan42> 3 JOKERS
[5:03:41] <ihavesillyknees> YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIGHT JANE!!!!!
[5:03:41] <xeros720> 3 banes will fill him, 3 banes will thrill him, you should make woolie fight 3 BANES
[5:03:41] <Asuterisuku> And Croc though.
[5:03:42] <+allups> they really turn bane into a jobber
[5:03:43] <+MugenSandan> Gee Bruce how come your mom lets you blind THREE BANES
[5:03:45] <%aram909> killer croc
[5:03:46] <leith_aziz> @Doctadaking The one good thing that came from this fight
[5:03:46] <Komayeda> Scarecrow too
[5:03:46] <mr_red117> Scarecrow
[5:03:48] <peachy996> Croc
[5:03:49] <+eanscrale> Scarecrow had a moment
[5:03:49] <Tatrix912> My favorite Bane boss fight is in Batman Arkham.... Origins lol
[5:03:50] <+Undenizen> Banes, add fights, and Ivy
[5:03:50] <scrumbotime> Baneham Asylum
[5:03:50] <%aram909> i guess killer croc was half a bane
[5:03:50] <ihavesillyknees> Fuck this Jane fight.
[5:03:51] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Cause that seems boring
[5:03:51] <dukenux> Croc is just a water bane
[5:03:52] <penitentpendant> Jobber Croc
[5:03:53] <Xiangchang> We live in a Baneciety.
[5:03:53] <+AkronymCLT> WE COULD BE PRO FORTNITE BANERS
[5:03:53] <%aram909> scarecrow
[5:03:54] <%Mrbaconator> A tale of two banes

[5:04:02] <Komayeda> RUN LIKE THE COWARD YOU ARE
[5:04:04] <mudamudajo> It was all a Bane. I used to read Bane up Magazine.
[5:04:04] <Reveresao> Does batman have the cape stun in this game? I can't remember?
[5:04:05] <Doctadaking> It‚Äôs not even a goddamn fight
[5:04:05] <Daveythe6thMoon> Yeah, do Croc and Scarecrow count? Or are they more set pieces? Hmm...
[5:04:05] <xeros720> no, it's worse
[5:04:06] <Asuterisuku> Joker's in control; he isn't going to charge you.
[5:04:07] <+skyheys> GOONS, BEST FIGHT
[5:04:07] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I mean this is boring but would it have been any different
[5:04:08] <%aram909> arkham city's bosses are so much better
[5:04:08] <+Jiggisnipe> oh really MORE ADS
[5:04:09] <feralspidey> grapple

[5:04:40] <Reveresao> @T_Sasquatch ty
[5:04:41] <dekkitout> Bane only, no items, Final Destination
[5:04:41] <KnivesEve> its been awhile but isnt city better?
[5:04:45] <+eanscrale> Man the 2000s were SOOOOO Edgy
[5:04:48] <+Veraverse> To be fair, City uses this shitty event really well into the plot
[5:04:48] <dukenux> "But doctor... i AM the Bane"
[5:04:49] <T_Sasquatch> The wall is lava
[5:04:49] <dinnydanny777> Joker being a big strong man goes against his character limesHmm
[5:04:49] <leith_aziz> @KnivesEve In every way
[5:04:49] <AhmCha> Man the PTSD from this is never gonna heal
[5:04:50] <xeros720> yeah, City is generally better
[5:04:52] <+UnwoundCaesar70> yes city is better
[5:04:53] <justianxix> Not even a cool fu
[5:04:53] <+Undenizen> I'm not!
[5:04:55] <+samuraiknack> Imagine getting an amazing tug job only to dribble out onto the floor
[5:04:55] <jorniev> IM NOT
[5:04:55] <balthazar758> he just stands there
[5:04:56] <miucsa51> The only things that saves this boss fight is mark ham it up
[5:04:56] <Aussie_Manny> Joker was preparing for this.
[5:04:57] <+paladinstarbuster> WHO PAINTED THAT
[5:04:58] <%NorthGrizzly> City is TOO BIG
[5:04:58] <dukenux> HONK HOBK
[5:04:59] <SoaringTrumpet> honk honk
[5:05:00] <ihavesillyknees> It wasn't the 2000 it was like 2010
[5:05:01] <willyfreshness> I like that there are ramifications for joker bane in city
[5:05:01] <+taggerung403> Imagine if a Spider-man game was all Rhino
[5:05:01] <sunnythedrunk> Bet you weren't expecting MORE BANES
[5:05:01] <+chosenjuan42> the last boss is literally a BIG JOKE
[5:05:01] <Asuterisuku> That's Killing Joke joker on the floor too.
[5:05:03] <%emptyantics> HONK HONO
[5:05:03] <+mundanelotus> no gadget use woolieSPICE
[5:05:04] <DatAsuna> city is better in some ways worse inothers
[5:05:04] <%LCLSmoothie> honk honk
[5:05:10] <%TheTyper> Good job Wooloie
[5:05:12] <peachy996> The best part about this fight is the long term consequences that follow later on in the series
[5:05:13] <+Jiggisnipe> at least he's still Joker in personality
[5:05:16] <Aussie_Manny> Good work, Woolz.
[5:05:17] <waffleandman> NOW DO IT 2 MORE TIMES
[5:05:19] <+FuqBoiSlim> Someone at Rocksteady designed the first Titan fight and thought they struck fucking gold huh
[5:05:19] <+SolidusRex> NO HONKING $350 FINE
[5:05:19] <miucsa51> WE LIVE IN A BANE SOCIETY
[5:05:20] <Doctadaking> Congrats. That‚Äôs the whole fucking fight
[5:05:20] <JanusII> Do you think Joker commissions artists for these things?
[5:05:21] <mighty_fine_trousers> Oh look the entire fight
[5:05:23] <+skyheys> WOW COOL
[5:05:25] <$doomerskeletor13> YUCKING IT UP

[5:05:28] <Dio_TR> STRONK BATMAN
[5:05:28] <%krispen_wa> AMAZING BOSS
[5:05:28] <Komayeda> THAT PICTURE IS GREAT
[5:05:28] <%TheTyper> Rinse and repeat
[5:05:30] <%invader_rin> Rule of 3
[5:05:32] <$LightningLynx89> At least this fight is short
[5:05:32] <+GenesisKnight> And now you know the loop LUL
[5:05:32] <jorniev> RULE OF 3 CAUSE VIDEO GAMES
[5:05:33] <+DomunDomunDomun> @SolidusRex HONK
[5:05:33] <heart_ablaze> VIDEO GAME
[5:05:33] <%saladin1911> Step Mom was stuck again LUL
[5:05:36] <%the_vedo_show> LMAO
[5:05:36] <%NorthGrizzly> City and Knight the ultimate proof that LESS IS MORE
[5:05:37] <enerkaizer> Batmans DP is broken. Best shoryuken ever
[5:05:38] <Dio_TR> LUL
[5:05:38] <%Mattais88> 3 hits, more than enough for anything that moves
[5:05:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Komayeda
[5:05:41] <Macabre__> SOOO FUUUUN
[5:05:41] <TheWizardOfWordplay> gimmick fight not a bane tbf
[5:05:42] <feralspidey> now do it2 more times
[5:05:42] <+Veraverse> AND THEN YOU'LL BE A BANE
[5:05:42] <AhmCha> this is......even worse than i remember
[5:05:42] <+skyheys> UUUUUGH
[5:05:43] <Aussie_Manny> Reggie, you joke...
[5:05:43] <sunnythedrunk> TIMEOUT MORE BANES
[5:05:45] <+Crimsonpajamas > offf
[5:05:45] <miucsa51> They Knew
[5:05:45] <Meltgar> BIG DAMAGE
[5:05:48] <+FuqBoiSlim> Batman: 3 Banes
[5:05:49] <Komayeda> Now run like the bat-coward you are!
[5:05:49] <T_Sasquatch> To be fair the joker injecting himself with this shit leads to some interesting stuff in the next game
[5:05:50] <%LCLSmoothie> Bane vs Capcom
[5:05:50] <+Shonen_hero> that's as many as three tens
[5:05:51] <+Crimsonpajamas > oooooof
[5:05:51] <Daveythe6thMoon> This is less of a Bane fight and more of a game of keep away guest starring the GOONS
[5:05:52] <osaka_daioh> AGAIN?!
[5:05:54] <feralspidey> World War Bane
[5:05:57] <dinnydanny777> So many adds NotLikeThis
[5:05:57] <arkv01> need your gutters cleaned? Your lawns mowed? CALL THE THREE BANES
[5:05:57] <+Jiggisnipe> this isn't a true Bane, he just looks like Bane
[5:05:58] <+eanscrale> This is more stupid then there being two supermen, one red, one blue
[5:05:59] <+HollowMan190> Attack on Jokebane
[5:05:59] <%Monkeyweed21> THIS IS THE FIGHT
[5:06:00] <Asuterisuku> Oh good, the knife guy got zapped.
[5:06:03] <miucsa51> Super Bane God Super Bane
[5:06:05] <+1spidersymbiotepool> all you gotta do is run when joker swings
[5:06:07] <%bPlusPlus> I forgot this game was pretty floppy
[5:06:07] <%Mattais88> Wait is this just mook fights?
[5:06:14] <scrumbotime> Hey, I'm pretty sure Gordon isn't getting out of this without incredible nerve damage from all that electricity
[5:06:17] <%Xelhesia> YEA THIS A VICTORY LAP FIGHT
[5:06:18] <+allups> imagine batman retelling this story. he is probably like Joker was on some shit that night
[5:06:18] <dukenux> honk honk
[5:06:19] <+mundanelotus> Woolie really improved his flow in combat
[5:06:20] <arkv01> that honk does things to me
[5:06:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> someone screamed "keep hitting him" but it sounded like "nvidia"
[5:06:22] <+AWKWARDL0SER> I‚Äôm the dirtiest Bane insight matter fact bring out the Banes and let‚Äôs have a Banefight
[5:06:22] <Daveythe6thMoon> I look forward to the close up of Woolie and Reggie in the anime.
[5:06:23] <HolyGriddles> It‚Äôs true. Arkham City plot makes this better
[5:06:23] <mudamudajo> This fight is smelly.
[5:06:24] <+skyheys> Always remember this was the best Arkham game. THIS.
[5:06:26] <devanmuse> God, City even does the "big brute fight" better than asylum
[5:06:30] <Asuterisuku> Any time I hear a bike horn like that I can only think of a certain recurring Civvie joke.
[5:06:31] <radar410> @NorthGrizzly Knight has less Riddler stuff than City though lol
[5:06:33] <Aussie_Manny> Do combo is tough sometimes.
[5:06:34] <arkv01> PEAK batman
[5:06:34] <+AkronymCLT> Not Even a Sudden Bane can Defeat Me
[5:06:36] <Rubecks> almost 20 hits PogChamp
[5:06:41] <wqorst> A
[5:06:43] <%krispen_wa> WHAT AN AMAZING BOSS
[5:06:46] <NeonBleu> Are you Baning, son?
[5:06:46] <sunnythedrunk> One of the worst Final Boss Fights
[5:06:46] <+UnwoundCaesar70> this is not the best arkham game
[5:06:49] <Dio_TR> HE DID CAME BACK THO
[5:06:49] <+eanscrale> Not good I imagine
[5:06:49] <dukenux> the "honk honk coocoo" perfectly summarizes enrire boss fight
[5:06:51] <Asuterisuku> Look how torn your cape is now though.
[5:06:51] <$LightningLynx89> I'm sure Mark loved the paycheck
[5:06:51] <+Veraverse> He probably didn't knew the context
[5:06:53] <$doomerskeletor13> City is much better than this lmao
[5:06:53] <Laironx3> This is the Tiny Tiger boss from Crash Bandicoot Warped
[5:06:54] <T_Sasquatch> woooooo 3 times
[5:06:54] <miucsa51> God this boss reminds me why i think Arkham City is better
[5:06:55] <%Deft_Thought> Designing good boss fights is really difficult but man, when they're done poorly, its really frustrating
[5:06:57] <balthazar758> do something joker, anything
[5:06:58] <+condemned_15> He was thinking about DAT CASH
[5:06:58] <WarKamex> it's a paycheck
[5:06:59] <SixthShinx> Just like TLJ, he was getting paid
[5:07:00] <%aram909> @UnwoundCaesar70 yeah it is, even with the bad bosses
[5:07:02] <Dio_TR> YUP
[5:07:02] <+paladinstarbuster> OH NO MY CLAWS -Joker
[5:07:03] <Darren716> This wasn't just a Majima job
[5:07:03] <Daveythe6thMoon> The only silver lining to this fight is that it's not too hard which is a bit relieving after the last fight.
[5:07:03] <OldManDeckardCain> he chose to forget LUL
[5:07:05] <Dio_TR> it' sjust Atlas
[5:07:05] <arkv01> mark is a PROFESSIONAL :)
[5:07:07] <%emptyantics> Just like TLJ
[5:07:07] <xeros720> ahaha, it is
[5:07:07] <Komayeda> I mean, Bane Joker is funny I guess?
[5:07:07] <+UnwoundCaesar70> no it's. ot
[5:07:09] <Chester_goes_Berserk> City's plot starts great and then gets bogged down with Penguin
[5:07:09] <penitentpendant> Oh, is that the next game?
[5:07:09] <jorniev> woooow YEAH BIOSHOCK
[5:07:11] <+allups> its probly a time thing tbh tons of games have bad endings cuz of it
[5:07:12] <DatAsuna> Mark has voiced worse joker stuff before
[5:07:12] <%Nomad_Scholar> I think The Batman cartoon had Joker like this before
[5:07:13] <+UnwoundCaesar70> *not
[5:07:15] <+eanscrale> That's probably why
[5:07:16] <+Jiggisnipe> he's still being Joker so its fine kinda
[5:07:16] <Darren716> Atlas had a decent design at least
[5:07:16] <%ConLin_Arts_> Frank Fontaine yeah
[5:07:17] <+Pandamazing> same lighting too
[5:07:18] <$LightningLynx89> Cause it sucks Woolie!
[5:07:18] <+Veraverse> BANESHOCK
[5:07:19] <Darren716> Woolie we did
[5:07:19] <dukenux> He brought his A game to this, i dont think he was offfended ir anyhing
[5:07:19] <Tracazoid> We try not to
[5:07:19] <Asuterisuku> There's a reason for that.
[5:07:19] <Dio_TR> IT DOESN'T EXIST
[5:07:21] <Aussie_Manny> We don't WANT TO
[5:07:23] <Dio_TR> Kappa
[5:07:24] <DatAsuna> Actual;ly everyone talks about this part lol
[5:07:24] <plaguedoctor_syan> OH fuck you are right Woolie
[5:07:24] <mr_red117> no one wants to remebere
[5:07:25] <+NocturnePsycho> For obvious reasons lmao
[5:07:25] <Jashter18> Everybody does
[5:07:25] <NeonBleu> for good reason
[5:07:25] <Darren716> Everyone talks about this
[5:07:25] <%krispen_wa> No one wants to
[5:07:25] <$doomerskeletor13> People remember the good stuff
[5:07:25] <+GenesisKnight> YEAH I WONDER WHY
[5:07:26] <thebalticguy1> WE JUST FORGET IT
[5:07:26] <+FuqBoiSlim> ü§° ass boss fight
[5:07:26] <miucsa51> Baneshock
[5:07:26] <feralspidey> Baneshock INFINITE
[5:07:27] <+MightyDuckShoes> we wanted it to be a secret
[5:07:27] <+SaiyanShoto> For a good reason LUL LUL LUL
[5:07:28] <%LastHazzerd> we didn't wanna spoil it for ya
[5:07:28] <+DeChunkandFriends> We wanted you to be "surprised"
[5:07:28] <+ColonelHandzLanza> Just like the 2nd half of DS1
[5:07:28] <%NorthGrizzly> @NorthGrizzly RACE TRACKS
[5:07:28] <sunnythedrunk> Would you kindly turn into Bane?
[5:07:28] <OverlordedK> plenty of people talk about how bad it is LUL
[5:07:29] <peachy996> Pat warned you
[5:07:31] <+skyheys> GAME ENDS WHEN TV EXPLODE
[5:07:31] <puluxor> Oh great, now I wanna replay Bioshock too tyrantBruh
[5:07:31] <+UnwoundCaesar70> city and knight are way better than this even orgins
[5:07:34] <balthazar758> this never happened
[5:07:34] <+allups> u see why
[5:07:34] <Asuterisuku> Dude has a gun over there.
[5:07:35] <%Rafoki> People talk about it they say it is BAD LOL
[5:07:35] <dinnydanny777> Of course no one talks about the bad parts of these games limesHmm
[5:07:36] <heart_ablaze> FOR GOOD REASON
[5:07:36] <+Shonen_hero> Pat did warn you
[5:07:37] <+Aeoneth> smol brain: Bane Joker Galaxy Brain: Bulker
[5:07:38] <CoffeeSlice> IT REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE BANE
[5:07:40] <dekkitout> I remember vampire Joker in The Batman, but not venomed out
[5:07:40] <+UnwoundCaesar70> just with gameplay one
[5:07:42] <plaguedoctor_syan> Everyone talk about this part
[5:07:42] <%saladin1911> What part. The screen is currently blank Kappa
[5:07:43] <%orcstr16> We talk about it like its a cancer that we want to kill.
[5:07:46] <CalderGaming> woolie, pat plainly said to put all expectations in the trash
[5:07:46] <+UnwoundCaesar70> alone
[5:07:47] <TheCrispyBoi> pat did
[5:07:49] <DatAsuna> People explciitly talk about this part almost anytime asylum comes up
[5:07:50] <$doomerskeletor13> It‚Äôs because City makes this much better
[5:07:50] <Digsby> This would be improved by a group of children attacking Joker tho
[5:07:51] <arkv01> god I LOVE that honk
[5:07:51] <Draco_Renegade> City is the high point of the series
[5:07:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> I just like the dumb poses he does
[5:07:53] <Jolly_Adventurer> Gun-Man, the natural enemy of the bat
[5:07:54] <+Katohearts> For good reasob
[5:07:54] <plaguedoctor_syan> they call it Roid Joker
[5:07:55] <T_Sasquatch> I still wish woolie got the hang of the combat because its honestly fun
[5:07:55] <enerkaizer> The issue is just how little you actually fight the joker. More interaction could've saved this entire thing
[5:07:56] <%LastHazzerd> but this is one of the most notorious parts of the franchise
[5:07:56] <+Targical> Everyone talks shit about this part lol
[5:07:56] <+FuqBoiSlim> This boss fight is the Bioshock Infinite of boss fights. No I will not elaborate
[5:07:57] <Darren716> Yeah Pat did warn you about this
[5:08:01] <dukenux> [clown noises]
[5:08:01] <+CoronetChris> Cause it's the worst part.
[5:08:02] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> back when this released everyone talked about how bad it was, though that was a long time ago
[5:08:04] <+BigBlackBankai> At least this has ramifications in the later games.
[5:08:04] <sunnythedrunk> Everyone shit talks this part
[5:08:05] <arkv01> honk me like your acid vat girls joker
[5:08:06] <+eanscrale> Is this Joker better or worse than Jared Leto?
[5:08:06] <%ChoculaUltra> honk honk
[5:08:07] <mudamudajo> All your missing is Baneman
[5:08:07] <+nabs2099> Any boss fight where the boss summons adds is a bad boss fight
[5:08:10] <plaguedoctor_syan> because is Joker with steroids
[5:08:12] <miucsa51> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:08:12] <+PlatinumRevol> Woolie got through the whole game without a single combo takedown
[5:08:12] <%aram909> WOOLIE YOU BOUGHT TRIPLE BATARANGS FOR A REASON
[5:08:14] <Aussie_Manny> Pat did, but he loves talking about bad points of good things.
[5:08:15] <+MisterAvry> oh wow we're at the end already?
[5:08:16] <DatAsuna> It's funny how the guy with the gun is the most ddangerous thing int he whole boss fight
[5:08:23] <dekkitout> Baneman and Robane
[5:08:27] <%TheTyper> Yayyyyy
[5:08:30] <Dio_TR> IT'S OVER
[5:08:31] <peachy996> Finally
[5:08:32] <+Shonen_hero> God Joker looks terrible
[5:08:33] <+PlatinumRevol> DEFEATED
[5:08:33] <arkv01> why so tiny, batman?
[5:08:34] <Dio_TR> yeyeyeyeyeye
[5:08:34] <mudamudajo> WINNER
[5:08:36] <Daveythe6thMoon> Bane Joker has problems recognizing patterns.
[5:08:36] <BlackermanZX> ITS OVER
[5:08:37] <feralspidey> it's over
[5:08:37] <Doctadaking> I think Pat spoiled the Mr. Freeze fight so your idea of Arkham bosses wouldn‚Äôt be totally tainted by shit
[5:08:37] <%TheTyper> Dead???

[5:11:30] <DatAsuna> Not listening to pat is wise
[5:11:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> we didn't want to spoil the splendor

[5:13:20] <leith_aziz> City only gets better
[5:13:21] <OldManDeckardCain> SUPER BANE SUPER BANE BLUE
[5:13:21] <dinnydanny777> Anyway, here's WonderBane

[5:13:25] <%Monkeyweed21> ScareCrow is great
[5:13:26] <chaos4ever181> Scott Pilgrim vs BANE
[5:13:28] <Tracazoid> LUL We need Injustice 3, Bane Edition.
[5:13:28] <DatAsuna> Croc was basically a scripted bane
[5:13:28] <+sevorai> City really does slap, it's my favorite out of the arkham series
[5:13:29] <peachy996> OH MY GOD I Hope we get Bane at the end of these credits!
[5:13:30] <%krispen_wa> ULTRA BANESTINCT
[5:13:30] <MadFoxOfGamez> Banes of the Corn
[5:13:30] <HolyGriddles> The Origin Bane Fight is really cool
[5:13:32] <leith_aziz> I'll give City a 9/10
[5:13:32] <+eanscrale> Yes Dragon Ball is actually quite enjoyable minus wannabe wukong kid
[5:13:34] <+MisterAvry> Scarecrow is a highlight
[5:13:35] <+allups> this art is amazing
[5:13:35] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Glad you liked it okay, despite all the Bane
[5:13:36] <+panlakes> it looks fine
[5:13:37] <+Targical> Nah next game is probably best in series for its pacing and diversity
[5:13:38] <willyfreshness> game has great atmosphere
[5:13:39] <%ChoculaUltra> Atelier Bane and the Ever Venom
[5:13:41] <chaos4ever181> Doom Eternal BANE
[5:13:42] <+Story_Ark> at the time it was super good banes aside. but after city it feels worse since it just took that and did it better

[5:13:45] <peachy996> Pray for Aftercredits Bane, Chat
[5:13:46] <$doomerskeletor13> City takes everything this game started and builds on it in some really great ways
[5:13:50] <+Veraverse> The Boss fight gets better in City
[5:13:50] <sunnythedrunk> For 2009? this game was great
[5:13:50] <+AWKWARDL0SER> City, Origin & Knight completely change the boss structure
[5:13:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Origin's Bane fight is legit my favorite in the series
[5:13:53] <%saladin1911> Dragon Ball is literally at its best without Goku most of the time
[5:13:57] <dukenux> the city improves on bosses
[5:13:59] <leith_aziz> All I'll say is that its a good game that aged in time
[5:14:00] <+allups> its old
[5:14:01] <357Sneak> Little less Banal with a little less Bane
[5:14:01] <miucsa51> Banequiem For A Dream LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:14:04] <%orcstr16> IT gets goofier in city
[5:14:05] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Wayne paid for the renovations
[5:14:05] <Asuterisuku> In future games they aren't specifically gargoyles.
[5:14:07] <TheManWhosHot> I think Woolie will end up liking Origins or Knight the most, if he does make it that far
[5:14:07] <ihavesillyknees> Shhhh don't think about it
[5:14:08] <masterfire23> maybe like a ciry
[5:14:08] <OldManDeckardCain> Batman 8: Bane's Lacrimosa
[5:14:08] <+allups> o true
[5:14:09] <+iikeogh> its because the water family pays for gargoyles
[5:14:10] <+RyanTheRecluse> City is a massive improvement over asylum.
[5:14:10] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus the OG final boss design was a spider joker, it was waaaay better looking
[5:14:10] <arkv01> whatever, laugh and grow fat!
[5:14:11] <Deasmeister> Origin has real good bosses
[5:14:12] <mrapplebucks> Bafense of the Banecents
[5:14:12] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus btw, if you really want you can do the challenges to practice the fighting, in case you want to if you think about doing city
[5:14:14] <+Shonen_hero> I think that now that I know a good batman game can exist, a little of the magic was lost, but I still love this game. Good ol' stomping grounds
[5:14:16] <huskarl_zap> wtf was that spiky enemy?
[5:14:16] <Darren716> Hmm if only there was a game that was outdoors Kappa
[5:14:19] <jorniev> ILIKED CITY A LOT

[5:14:51] <Asuterisuku> I forgot Crystal Dynamics was involved in the port.
[5:14:52] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Best Arkhams in order: Origins, City, Asylum then Knight
[5:14:54] <Aussie_Manny> Needs more Bane.
[5:14:54] <%emptyantics> WENDELL?!
[5:14:55] <@Solidus_113> Is Arkham Asylum a good Metroid game? @WoolieVersus
[5:14:55] <+FuqBoiSlim> All this game taught me is that Arkham is an absolute nightmare to be committed too. No wonder everyone's loopy
[5:14:55] <+condemned_15> Bane is a B Class Bug
[5:14:55] <%LCLSmoothie> ALL THE WARRIORS
[5:15:00] <+MightyDuckShoes> I was waiting for him to be on the list. he just blocked it all as a coping mechanism
[5:15:00] <balthazar758> QA Squad
[5:15:00] <sunnythedrunk> No Female Banes D:
[5:15:03] <Daveythe6thMoon> You know what this fight needs? TWO BANES
[5:15:04] <%aram909> @sunnythedrunk devil may cry says hello, bayonetta stomps you with her heels
[5:15:04] <xeros720> they bugged Bane so much, it was the only boss that worked
[5:15:09] <starwolfgang> Tighten up the Banes on level 3
[5:15:10] <+eanscrale> It's literally the bane of this game.
[5:15:18] <+UnwoundCaesar70> why we putting Knight last when its the best gameplay wise
[5:15:20] <dekkitout> The world wasn't ready for fem bane- it is now

[5:15:25] <coreybom> This is actually pretty awesome they give a shout out to the QA. SeemsGood
[5:15:26] <+chosenjuan42> BANEHAM ASYLUM
[5:15:26] <sunnythedrunk> @aram909 I mean yes those too
[5:15:26] <T_Sasquatch> Im unironically about to install the arkham games on my ps3
[5:15:29] <miucsa51> Bane Bane Bane Bane Bane Bane Bane and More Banes
[5:15:32] <plaguedoctor_syan> Did they really ship this game with just this amount of Bane?
[5:15:33] <%aram909> as far as action combat goes, the arkham games just made simple 2 button combat more prevalent
[5:15:33] <mortificent> I think there's a post credits scene
[5:15:35] <leith_aziz> @L3m0nTwi5t To me: City, Origins, Asylum (though for originality I say Asylum takes over Origins) and then Knight
[5:15:35] <DatAsuna> Needs more racetracks
[5:15:35] <%aram909> its not great combat
[5:15:36] <357Sneak> Started from the bottom, now the Whole team Banein here!
[5:15:38] <Asuterisuku> Arkham City was planned from the start.
[5:15:42] <%krispen_wa> @UnwoundCaesar70 because you can barely play the gameplay because of all the car sections
[5:15:43] <+Veraverse> ARKHAM CITY'S NAME DOES MAKE SENSE
[5:15:43] <%Monkeyweed21> it makes sense in City
[5:15:46] <%aram909> especially not compared to the greats like DMC, bayo, even god of war
[5:15:46] <keankong85> don't worry, that well be enough of the venom from here
[5:15:47] <+Shonen_hero> and it becomes sillier and sillier over time
[5:15:48] <dundore77> Arkham game names make sense though. cept origins
[5:15:49] <dinnydanny777> Now to go find the rest of Arkham's notes Kappa
[5:15:51] <Jaysky> There's always an Arkham
[5:15:52] <Giztech> heres a bane, theres a bane, everywhere where a bane... lol
[5:15:52] <xeros720> the combat really is fun, it's a neat style of action game and it only gets tighter and mechanically dense as the games go on
[5:15:55] <Doctadaking> Arkham City was planned. Hence, the secret room
[5:16:00] <+DomunDomunDomun> See: Injustice comics
[5:16:01] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus the OG final boss design was a spider joker, it was waaaay better looking
[5:16:03] <+asgard147> To be fair, Bane's Venom is kinda the center point of the story in Asylum so it sorta makes sense, but still, they WAY overuse the Titan brutes.
[5:16:04] <+NocturnePsycho> The only arkham name that didnt make sense was origins
[5:16:05] <Tracazoid> There's an animated Arkham movie that is basically a Suicide Squad movie, a better Suicide Squad movie.
[5:16:05] <Asuterisuku> Origins was the odd one out as far as the name making sense.
[5:16:05] <SainEdge> yeah, cant forget that this was the first one, they improved a lot gameplaywise
[5:16:07] <Darren716> I just got to the Arkham Knight name reveal, boy that's a fucking stretch
[5:16:09] <dekkitout> Arkham Knight was changed in comics
[5:16:10] <miucsa51> BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANEEEEEEEE
[5:16:11] <Depthcharge2030> Injustice comic is God Tier
[5:16:13] <Aussie_Manny> Flaws? Where?
[5:16:13] <+MightyDuckShoes> Disco Elysium: Now With BANE from the Bane Asylum Series
[5:16:14] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Can people go back and play Knight to see how much the car is not in that game
[5:16:15] <%saladin1911> Flaws? Where?
[5:16:15] <Blank9> I. am. Baneman.
[5:16:16] <Jaysky> Flaws? Slap a bane on it
[5:16:17] <jorniev> YUP
[5:16:20] <BlackermanZX> the Bane Bones
[5:16:24] <$jodio_> Arkham City is definitely better
[5:16:25] <$arcielardor> Arkham Bane, Revenge of Team Bane
[5:16:25] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I feels thats always the complain
[5:16:25] <Dante_Namikaze1> All the Arkham comics aren't canon to the games
[5:16:26] <jorniev> THATS ARKHAM
[5:16:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They managed to make a batman game that wasn't total trash and then they milked it for four games
[5:16:28] <thebalticguy1> Im surprised the combat never clicked for you @WoolieVersus
[5:16:31] <Dame_90> Arkham City is where it's at
[5:16:31] <+chosenjuan42> It's old. But good for it's time
[5:16:39] <Prevot> the combat is honestly pretty overrated
[5:16:41] <DatAsuna> Sleeping dogs
[5:16:41] <mr_red117> they refine it over time
[5:16:43] <leith_aziz> At knight, I see it as "ok" and knida fun
[5:16:45] <godila2> @UnwoundCaesar70 i played it and loved it, but not stealth batmobile fights
[5:16:45] <+BigBlackBankai> To me Asylum, then every game trades good and bad things but imo they get worse.
[5:16:46] <+eanscrale> Honestly the sequel was hard to pick up after THAT boss fight.
[5:16:47] <+Story_Ark> @woolieversus plus at the time a triple A superhero game thats GOOD was unthinkable.
[5:16:48] <+samuraiknack> Thanks legal
[5:16:48] <Darren716> City expands combat a ton
[5:16:49] <Aussie_Manny> The combat gets better with each instalment.
[5:16:49] <puluxor> I still think it's a good ass video game, and I'm not even a dedicated Batman fan SeemsGood
[5:16:50] <jorniev> the beatdown move in arkham city is so good
[5:16:51] <leith_aziz> But it was never my favorite
[5:16:52] <+NocturnePsycho> @fruit_pie_the_magician milking is a strong word
[5:16:52] <dundore77> Did you never play shadow of mordor? the later games are more that level
[5:16:53] <+Melodic_Slayer> Arkham City is better
[5:16:54] <%aram909> @Prevot 100
[5:16:55] <mortificent> Spider-Man refined it
[5:16:58] <ihavesillyknees> They made it better later on
[5:17:00] <Komayeda> It gets better in the other games
[5:17:00] <Jashter18> This is the progenitor though
[5:17:01] <leith_aziz> I think Mordor does combat better I think
[5:17:03] <thebalticguy1> @WoolieVersus Have you watched Combo Mads of Arkham combat?
[5:17:03] <%TheTyper> Yeah @fruit_pie_the_magician that's the thing: Pre this game, Batman was TRASH in video games.
[5:17:05] <DatAsuna> Yeah you've played 11 years of improvements to it
[5:17:05] <SainEdge> City improved a lot
[5:17:05] <+GenesisKnight> It's been refined over the years
[5:17:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You'll understand after City Woolie
[5:17:06] <HorribleHog> It reminded me of ACreed1 at the time
[5:17:06] <sunnythedrunk> Spider Man is just a better version of it
[5:17:06] <Ipsenscastle> It was amazing for 2K9, compare it to Assassins Creed 1
[5:17:09] <%aram909> spider-man is the best version of the arkham combat imo thanks to the air combos and web-swinging
[5:17:09] <+Javaa01> This was by far the roughest iteration of it
[5:17:09] <StarlitStunner> Nightwing is great
[5:17:10] <Prevot> spider-man definitely did it WAY better
[5:17:10] <Asuterisuku> The Arkham Knight is someone who was in the Asylum at this time.
[5:17:11] <Iwashi94> this kinda game felt super unique back in 2009 tbf
[5:17:12] <+paladinstarbuster> to be fair you were very bad at it
[5:17:12] <T_Sasquatch> The combat is rated BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST EVER at the time
[5:17:12] <pi_in_the_sci> My favorite version of this combat is Mad Max, because you don't ice skate around
[5:17:13] <+chosenjuan42> Once you get in the rythm the combat is amazing
[5:17:13] <%aram909> but its still very limited
[5:17:14] <@Solidus_113> this is the first one
[5:17:14] <sunnythedrunk> City is way way better
[5:17:15] <dinnydanny777> it's better in City
[5:17:15] <leith_aziz> Spiderman does it better
[5:17:15] <+PlatinumRevol> Maybe if you used more than half of the mechanics LUL
[5:17:16] <BlackermanZX> Spiderman combat is amazing
[5:17:17] <+asgard147> Are ya gonna try City then Woolie?
[5:17:18] <%CptnCampy61> Arkham City nailed it
[5:17:19] <enerkaizer> for its time it was amazing, but we have since then improved on it a lot
[5:17:19] <TheWizardOfWordplay> now we gotta push city
[5:17:19] <+mundanelotus> It's only "overrated" because you're coming back to it at it's infancy
[5:17:19] <+HollowMan190> it was all of 7th gen good times
[5:17:20] <+Jiggisnipe> tbf you have played improvements on it so...
[5:17:21] <+PikeBot> THe combat's clunky in this game, City reffined it substantially.
[5:17:21] <%aram909> especially compared to DMC or Platinum Games
[5:17:24] <%Monkeyweed21> This is the DMC 1 of the series
[5:17:25] <wujak> it does improve a lot with many more options
[5:17:27] <+Damie904> First iiteration dude. For the time it was great.
[5:17:27] <kifflomdolphin> It gets better later down the series, @WoolieVersus
[5:17:29] <SoaringTrumpet> it's a good game, when it came out it was pretty great
[5:17:30] <+allups> is that a confirmation
[5:17:31] <BlackermanZX> i mean this IS pretty much the first one
[5:17:31] <+Katohearts> f r e e f l o w
[5:17:31] <anAngryHamster> You did it bad though
[5:17:32] <Jaysky> TITAN'd up?
[5:17:32] <librettodude> "Titaned up"?
[5:17:33] <Depthcharge2030> City is well...longer
[5:17:33] <Tracazoid> City's much, much better in the combat department
[5:17:34] <+NocturnePsycho> Titaned up????
[5:17:34] <+Orfington> titan'ed up, huh
[5:17:34] <+skyheys> Bane city confirmrd
[5:17:37] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Spider-Man game was Arkham but better
[5:17:37] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @godila2 and that's fine stealth batmobile us not fun but every mother fucker is like the whole game is just batmobile like u don't do anything else
[5:17:38] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[5:17:39] <dekkitout> Titan'd up Kappa
[5:17:41] <+Melodic_Slayer> City? :o
[5:17:42] <ihavesillyknees> The final whiff is oof
[5:17:43] <Komayeda> We gonna play Arkham City?
[5:17:44] <miucsa51> CITY IMPROVES BY ALOT
[5:17:45] <T_Sasquatch> There was nothing like this years sgo
[5:17:46] <dundore77> that happens in city
[5:17:47] <Darren716> Woolie, go play Batman Dark Tomorrow, and see the mountain of quality between the two
[5:17:47] <Jaysky> Woolie you got titan'd up. You get BANE
[5:17:48] <brachydios777> It gets better
[5:17:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dude every batman until this was nothing but a beat em up. It's an actual good game, not just shovelware
[5:17:51] <Asuterisuku> City does it much better.
[5:17:51] <leith_aziz> The best description of this game is that its a DMC1 situation
[5:17:52] <+chosenjuan42> Just don't whiff
[5:17:52] <+Veraverse> City tomorrow, let's go
[5:17:57] <+mundanelotus> it did tho and that fucked u over
[5:17:58] <arcade0416> i mean to be fair -- and i mean this with love and respect -- woolie is just kinda bad at this combat style right now. i'm sure he'll get better though
[5:18:00] <+Melodic_Slayer> Titan'd up huh?
[5:18:02] <puluxor> Yeah, first version. It's amazing how well they did on their first go asakuraNote asakuraNote
[5:18:05] <%kewlmyc> Paved the way for Spider-Man which is better than every way IMO
[5:18:05] <SPidERMan8576> Roided joker
[5:18:06] <Asuterisuku> @Veraverse Noooo I wanna explore Yokohama with Woolie.
[5:18:07] <+Story_Ark> it takes time to get better. once i 100% the game i was doing huge combos and never dropping the whole fight
[5:18:11] <%TheTyper> Yup. Someone's describing City xD
[5:18:12] <+paladinstarbuster> thats in this game you just didnt use them
[5:18:16] <dinnydanny777> cool art
[5:18:17] <librettodude> Baneman Flow Fighting
[5:18:19] <dekkitout> This game Bane'd so Spider-Man can Bane
[5:18:19] <DatAsuna> @aram909 tbh I hate comparing everything to platinum, dmc batman would be massively unfitting. Not every melee fight should be dmc
[5:18:20] <+PlatinumRevol> You just didn't use them
[5:18:22] <+chosenjuan42> That happens in City
[5:18:22] <Doctadaking> City makes use of the tools in combat. It‚Äôs really fun
[5:18:24] <brachydios777> They do that in city
[5:18:24] <Komayeda> That gets fixed a bunch in the next game
[5:18:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:18:25] <leith_aziz> I do think keeping a rythm and getting high combos feels great
[5:18:25] <+Jiggisnipe> remember though, this is the 1st version
[5:18:25] <mr_red117> to be fair, this is straight up the first version of that system
[5:18:27] <+GenesisKnight> You didn't use the tools you had
[5:18:29] <Prevot> the stealth mechanics get really good and refined with each game, the combat gets... less worse with each game
[5:18:32] <+Damie904> Woolie you can use batarang and grapple mid combo if you wanted. Asylum just doesnt really tell you to try.
[5:18:33] <+mundanelotus> u can use gadgets in combat but u never used them
[5:18:34] <+chosenjuan42> City uses more tools in combat
[5:18:35] <Darren716> Quick gadgets become rad in city
[5:18:37] <Asuterisuku> You could quickfire the claw and the batarang in combat this whole time.
[5:18:38] <+Story_Ark> you can you just didnt use the gadgets in fights
[5:18:38] <+allups> Tool play is a thing but they dont feel great
[5:18:39] <leith_aziz> Stealth ONLY GETS BETTER
[5:18:40] <%rkbinder> comparing a game that came out in 2009 vs 2019
[5:18:40] <Laironx3> doing a combat takedown is like your cooldown while you fight a lot of enemies
[5:18:42] <+Melodic_Slayer> This is DMC1 while City is DMC3
[5:18:43] <leith_aziz> I love Stealth
[5:18:44] <Jaysky> Woolie, they had gadget takedowns
[5:18:48] <godila2> @UnwoundCaesar70 yeah i didnt like how they wasted that one boss for batmobile then we had great one before
[5:18:52] <dinnydanny777> City has combat upgrades that do a lot
[5:18:54] <BlackermanZX> i mean you totally can do it in fights LUL
[5:18:55] <sunnythedrunk> Spray was goofy in fights
[5:18:56] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Ayy give it up for our VAs
[5:18:57] <T_Sasquatch> You could use the spray for style LUL
[5:19:02] <DatAsuna> the quickselect options help a tad but they're still clunky
[5:19:05] <huskarl_zap> The real Batman and Joker voices
[5:19:05] <+KgKid51> you have to play city bro
[5:19:06] <TheWizardOfWordplay> every gadget gets a quick fire mode
[5:19:07] <T_Sasquatch> I loved doing ot
[5:19:07] <Jaysky> Hook in combat is amazing
[5:19:08] <wujak> they give quick options for tools in later combat.
[5:19:09] <DatAsuna> Dodging and hitting L3 just feels bad
[5:19:09] <+Story_Ark> you can use the claw and spray in fights, theyre necessary for the harder challenges
[5:19:10] <+1spidersymbiotepool> @kewlmyc well Spidey kinda already had something similar in 04 with Spider-Man 2
[5:19:13] <%rkbinder> comparing a game that came out in 2009 vs 2019
[5:19:14] <iLike_femboys> @WoolieVersus the OG final boss design was a spider joker, it was waaaay better looking
[5:19:17] <BlackermanZX> spray is kinda busted if you know how to use it
[5:19:20] <cosmicgoatee> not sure if they care but they could just look up the collectibles for lore and bios
[5:19:23] <+StooEsq> Cree Summer was in this, too? I should've known
[5:19:24] <peachy996> C'mooooon Bane
[5:19:26] <+Targical> Instant takedown animations are dope
[5:19:27] <Doctadaking> But that scarecrow tho. Especially the third encounter
[5:19:28] <atema128> They have quick-use inputs in City and onward that incorporate gadgets (more and better ones too).
[5:19:29] <+condemned_15> Italian Cast was recorded at Salami Studios LUL
[5:19:30] <%krispen_wa> we get it about spider joker already
[5:19:30] <Darren716> Spray dodge in city is so damn good
[5:19:30] <+SolidusRex> Half the fun about Arkham Asylum is the exploration, which Woolie didn't do much
[5:19:31] <sunnythedrunk> After playing spiderman it's hard to like the original game's combat
[5:19:33] <peachy996> I really really hope we get Bane
[5:19:35] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @godila2 yeah I get ya i just don't like when everyone shits on Knight when it's just as good as the other arkham games
[5:19:36] <leith_aziz> Its a game thats good but has showed its age
[5:19:36] <DrkJP520> Wow you beat the game already? how bout that final boss lol
[5:19:38] <TheyCallMeVawn> City is infinitely better
[5:19:38] <@Solidus_113> Is Arkham Asylum a good Metroid game? @WoolieVersus
[5:19:38] <+allups> spray is super bust but i learned that like 3 play though in
[5:19:39] <enerkaizer> I forgot, this has a german dub, too LUL
[5:19:42] <+asgard147> This is the first version of the system, it's not to bad for the first attempt, to be fair
[5:19:45] <DatAsuna> and bane
[5:19:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> Calendar Man
[5:19:46] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Everything improved in City & Knight by a lot

[5:20:05] <DatAsuna> did you notice bane?
[5:20:05] <miucsa51> Too much Bane
[5:20:08] <cosmicgoatee> everyone forgets about Arkham Origins Kappa
[5:20:09] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Basically city & Knight are ‚Äútoo big‚Äù but otherwise better in every way
[5:20:11] <thebalticguy1> Have you watched any Arkham Combo mads? I think that would help it click for you
[5:20:12] <Asuterisuku> Calendar Man has a shitty achievement tied to him in City.
[5:20:16] <%krispen_wa> PAT ONLINE
[5:20:19] <enerkaizer> Wow, David Nathan was Batman in the German dub. That's our voice for Piccolo from DBZ and Johny Depp

[5:20:57] <%sirisvirus> arkham city makes it super easy to combo into tools
[5:20:57] <%agoaj> Woolie did use his tools, a bunch of batarangs in combat, but not much today.

[5:21:35] <miucsa51> NEON GENESIS BANELION
[5:21:35] <jorniev> THAT ending is random btw
[5:21:35] <feralspidey> ScareBane
[5:21:37] <+MisterAvry> Banecrow is good
[5:21:37] <%Deft_Thought> ScareBane
[5:21:38] <Aussie_Manny> Scarebane
[5:21:39] <rytisone> Now the final final boss - RIDDLER BANE
[5:21:40] <Reveresao> That riddle game is wake
[5:21:40] <arcade0416> yeah you'd think so huh :(
[5:21:40] <+condemned_15> The Post Credits can either be Scarecrow, Croc, or Bane. It's random
[5:21:41] <%KoopaPrez> It could have also been Croc or BANE
[5:21:42] <Doctadaking> Yeah, I usually get Bane there
[5:21:42] <%aram909> challenge mode is fun
[5:21:43] <Asuterisuku> By the way.
[5:21:43] <Reveresao> weak*
[5:21:44] <%agoaj> Surprisingly wrong
[5:21:46] <Darren716> I'm shocked they do nothing with Crow in city

[5:21:46] <Dio_TR> BLOODY PALACE TIME
[5:21:46] <DatAsuna> let's have a look at those
[5:21:46] <Meltgar> BANECROW
[5:21:47] <A_CD_By_Thomas> There's lots of trippy shit in later entries
[5:21:48] <+mundanelotus> look at trophy tho
[5:21:48] <Asuterisuku> That's a tease for Knight in the first game.
[5:21:49] <+chosenjuan42> Big Riddle
[5:21:49] <sunnythedrunk> That's why Croc was so dumb cuz he was on Scarecrow gas Kappa
[5:21:50] <+Undenizen> huh. I got Croc in my stinger
[5:21:50] <+DomunDomunDomun> That ending is randomised between bane scarecrow and croc.
[5:21:50] <+MightyDuckShoes> there's alternate stingers?!
[5:21:51] <enerkaizer> That cliffhanger was followed up in Arkham knight, not in city which is kinda wild
[5:21:53] <mudamudajo> Try the joker challenge. play as joker
[5:21:54] <+AWKWARDL0SER> You‚Äôre the PERFECT workday streamer Duder! Also shout out to Reggie too üôãüèª‚ôÄÔ∏èü§üüèª
[5:21:56] <peachy996> Yeah listen to the tapes
[5:21:56] <Fetty_Krill> Banecrow
[5:21:56] <+BigBlackBankai> All I got is a rock.
[5:21:57] <+asgard147> Who first?
[5:21:59] <balthazar758> where all the banes at?
[5:22:00] <iLike_femboys> youtube night berdPog
[5:22:01] <+Story_Ark> oh you should watch the challenges. theres some fun combos
[5:22:01] <huskarl_zap> The after credits change
[5:22:04] <%rkbinder> react channel now
[5:22:05] <HolyGriddles> Joker for challenge mode is a lot of fun
[5:22:06] <dukenux> oh the post ending cutscene changes?
[5:22:06] <+Mordexai0> @domundomundomun THAT'S AWESOME
[5:22:12] <+chosenjuan42> Shout of Bane
[5:22:12] <penitentpendant> @DomunDomunDomun Wasn't the ending based on what difficulty you finished it in?
[5:22:13] <jorniev> OOPS ALL BANE
[5:22:14] <%aram909> @mudamudajo not in the pc version i think, unless you have mods
[5:22:16] <StarlitStunner> Bane reacts
[5:22:19] <TheWizardOfWordplay> you should also watch the visitor center scenes
[5:22:19] <Doctadaking> Also show Riddler throwing a tantrum
[5:22:20] <+Melodic_Slayer> Huh i got bane in my ending
[5:22:22] <%Mattais88> 98 riddler trophies? Nice for just happening across them
[5:22:24] <peachy996> Sadly it wasn't Bane but Scarecrow is the canon choice anyway
[5:22:26] <$SilverRoddo> Hey yo, Batmeng
[5:22:26] <DatAsuna> curfew?
[5:22:26] <Dio_TR> the purge will start zoon
[5:22:30] <sunnythedrunk> Have someone link you the video
[5:22:33] <dukenux> yeah. now that i think about it, i think i got croc
[5:22:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol it would have been better if that had been Bane
[5:22:38] <+StooEsq> Each Arkham game before Knight has a deep secret teasing the next game that wasn't found until months after release
[5:22:39] <Daveythe6thMoon> They may also wanna watch the result of finishing all the Riddler challenges.
[5:22:42] <+DomunDomunDomun> @penitentpendant Maybe, it's been a while.
[5:22:42] <DatAsuna> remember the virus stop spreading at night
[5:22:44] <Jashter18> Game Clear on Arkham
[5:22:45] <Darren716> Man how gracious of them
[5:22:47] <Asuterisuku> Montreal Curfew, because people can't just stay home.
[5:22:48] <+Targical> Was there video? I thought it was all audio for the spirit of arkham
[5:22:49] <+nabs2099> Yo is tomorrow Yakuza 7 day? Hell yeah!!!
[5:22:51] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah also watch the end of Riddler challenges
[5:22:54] <+samuraiknack> Wasn't the ending tied to the difficulty
[5:22:55] <dmtjinni> Woolz
[5:22:57] <+DeChunkandFriends> I still wish the challenges where you get to play as non-Bane Joker were ported over to the PC version instead of languishing on the PS3
[5:22:59] <%agoaj> riddler get arrested the end, it's all audio it's not worth seeking out.
[5:23:05] <%aram909> @samuraiknack no, completely random
[5:23:07] <$SilverRoddo> Curfew savings time
[5:23:08] <peachy996> Hope he doesn't get spoiled just by looking
[5:23:10] <restingbones> ... yall okay?
[5:23:12] <Dante_Namikaze1> @stooesq except for City they found that shit immediately
[5:23:14] <phantalime> I'm pretty sure the ending depends on difficulty
[5:23:15] <miucsa51> NANANNANA BANEMAAN
[5:23:16] <DatAsuna> sure
[5:23:18] <%agoaj> You can play as Joker in the Mac version and the remakes.
[5:23:22] <%krispen_wa> spirit of arkham
[5:23:24] <peachy996> Yeah that works
[5:23:24] <dinnydanny777> Amadeus
[5:23:24] <sunnythedrunk> Don't look at the Thumbnail
[5:23:25] <penitentpendant> @DomunDomunDomun I think it was... Bane on Easy, Scarecrow on Normal, Croc on Hard
[5:23:25] <Asuterisuku> Spirit of Arkham
[5:23:27] <puluxor> It's not really that the Arkham lore themselves are great, but the payoff at the end is asakuraThink asakuraThink
[5:23:28] <%sjay662> armadeus arkham
[5:23:29] <NeoMiami> amadeus arkham
[5:23:29] <arcade0416> @DeChunkandFriends there is a way to mod the PC version to be able to play the joker challenges. it's actually super easy, look it up on youtube some time
[5:23:29] <DatAsuna> We can see the reflection of the screen behind reggie lol
[5:23:31] <TheWizardOfWordplay> chronicles of arkham
[5:23:31] <+chosenjuan42> Amadeus Arkham
[5:23:31] <%aram909> @phantalime its 100% random. ive beaten the game on the same difficulty twice and gotten diff endings
[5:23:32] <+Damie904> amadeus
[5:23:33] <Doctadaking> His name is Bane
[5:23:33] <+condemned_15> alabaster Slim Arkham
[5:23:37] <%agoaj> You can also rip the Joker files out of the mac version and use them in the PC version.
[5:23:37] <cosmicgoatee> you should also have a look at the bios you didn't get
[5:23:41] <samuelfisk> Spirit of Arkham

[5:23:55] <huskarl_zap> MANTIS MAN?
[5:23:57] <%saladin1911> Spoiler: The Spirit of Arkham was Bane all along
[5:23:57] <rytisone> eh, it's no Doom Slayer lore
[5:23:57] <Aussie_Manny> The Bane Files.
[5:23:58] <ashenjuan25> The Arkham series is kinda too edgy to have the animated series cast it does tbh
[5:23:59] <T_Sasquatch> 16 mins.....
[5:23:59] <Asuterisuku> I've never seen anyone but Scarecrow pop out there.
[5:24:00] <+1spidersymbiotepool> did he just say Alistair Overeem the MMA Fighter? lol
[5:24:03] <+TueDuffCity> Watch a combo vid of the game btw
[5:24:04] <+MightyDuckShoes> So Joker actually was Vergil and they didnt think to have the ending be an actual mirror match of cat and mouse?
[5:24:04] <+StooEsq> @Dante_Namikaze1 Oh did they? It was relatively easy to find compared to Asylum's
[5:24:05] <dekkitout> Time for Lore üåà ‚ú®
[5:24:08] <+AWKWARDL0SER> The magic is on those tapes!
[5:24:10] <peachy996> Oh hey they can look at the bios too
[5:24:15] <+DeChunkandFriends> @arcade0416 But it's still a mod you have to do yourself instead of just having it in the new ones
[5:24:16] <+Chronobot> The Purge will commence soon
[5:24:27] <peachy996> OH FUCK

[5:53:33] <Equirah> YOU, of all people, watched Death Note?
[5:53:34] <+SolidusRex> CITY'S REMAKE IS WORSE

[5:53:36] <%akuda_bar> GHOST HAND

[5:53:37] <masterfire23> the pc version of city is really good

[5:53:40] <DatAsuna> fair
[5:53:43] <peachy996> Dr. Strange and his BUSHY EYEBROWS
[5:53:44] <Prevot> but the remasters are definitely MUCH BUGGIER, especially City
[5:53:46] <+Milpool> don't listen to chat look yourself
[5:53:48] <$SilverRoddo> I wanna see Bane fan art from all this
[5:53:49] <@Solidus_113> City's remake has busted reflections too
[5:53:50] <ashenjuan25> The shadow of Mordor series is a great copycat of this game‚Äôs combat
[5:53:51] <+CNYChris_D> Ill be playing the remakes soon because ive been wanting to play asylum again
[5:53:58] <Dante_Namikaze1> it's way worss
[5:54:00] <%RyTYoung> I hope the soundtrack isn't hooked by the claws of WB
[5:54:06] <peachy996> You won't see terrible tree textures at least
[5:54:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though I think city looks a bit better than asylum overall
[5:54:16] <Asuterisuku> @RyTYoung Don't count on it.
[5:54:16] <%agoaj> get v to replace the soundtrack for you
[5:54:17] <Chatterbox1991> I remember it had like really bad haier models or something?
