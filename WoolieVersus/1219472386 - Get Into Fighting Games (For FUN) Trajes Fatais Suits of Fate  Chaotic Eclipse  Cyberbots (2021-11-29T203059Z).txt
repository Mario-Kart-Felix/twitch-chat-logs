[0:09:07] <dds333a> great LUL

[0:09:19] <%DashXero> Luke: Ashley Riot's silhouette given different details.
[0:09:22] <%jinking79> Luke AKA Ed is Dead Now
[0:09:41] <dds333a> Protags???
[0:09:46] <NewDonkKing> always were
[0:09:48] <dds333a> I guess so
[0:09:50] <NeoNeonNero> Abal was a protag?????
[0:09:51] <leith_aziz> Rashid, yes, but not really Abel
[0:09:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Rashid is DEFINITELY the 5 Protag
[0:10:07] <NewDonkKing> rashid had most of the story mode
[0:10:09] <Afrosamasenpai> FANG was hit antagonist
[0:10:10] <%Deft_Thought> Abel got the clone saga
[0:10:11] <aghwee> i like that he is just MMA Guy™
[0:10:13] <Super_Voltekka> >Rashid is the protagonist LUL
[0:10:14] <Afrosamasenpai> his*
[0:10:15] <%townzzzzz> townzzzzz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hope you two are having a fine holiday as I am woolieYE majinoSeshun
[0:10:15] <leith_aziz> I'd say Rashid's a protag
[0:10:16] <+TopTieramisu> nash was the jebait protagonist
[0:10:20] <dds333a> Alex and Ryu sure, but yeah, I guess so
[0:10:24] <lazerscraper> Abel is a protag. hes another seth body. supposedly was healed back to life by charlie before he got axed.
[0:10:25] <%DashXero> Abel showed up... And we all forgot about him when Juri came into the picture.
[0:10:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> As for 4, I would...kinda argue C.Viper for 4
[0:10:37] <%fetrigon> who the fuck is Abel? lmao
[0:10:38] <NeoNeonNero> Rashid is awesome!
[0:10:38] <+TopTieramisu> abel looks so... dull
[0:10:41] <NeoNeonNero> Abel more like "WHO???"
[0:10:43] <%jinking79> Alex had more development in the game
[0:10:44] <+TopTieramisu> abel is the french grappler
[0:10:57] <dds333a> Abel was SFIV
[0:11:00] <%Deft_Thought> I miss Abel schmixups
[0:11:02] <leith_aziz> Maybe im biased towards Rashid as an arab, but hey pickyAYAYA
[0:11:08] <Super_Voltekka> Rashid is such a good protagonist his only Udon comic appearance in Issue 0 of Street Fighter vs Darkstalkers LUL
[0:11:17] <lazerscraper> yeah cuz shes fucking DEAD
[0:11:22] <NewDonkKing> yeah but ryus plot ended after 2
[0:11:23] <%DashXero> We found their disintegrated remains.
[0:11:23] <%Deft_Thought> Did Rashid do anything in story mode?
[0:11:24] <Afrosamasenpai> SUPER dead
[0:11:25] <NeoNeonNero> yeah, she was dead!
[0:11:36] <kikoeru_san> RASHIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:11:37] <%jinking79> she got killed by FANG
[0:11:38] <NewDonkKing> fang melted his friend
[0:11:40] <lazerscraper> literally melted
[0:11:45] <lazerscraper> into purple goo
[0:11:46] <dds333a> @deft_thought he bodied FANG
[0:11:47] <leith_aziz> Oh there was? Im intruiged
[0:11:53] <+VariantX7> She super dead
[0:12:01] <%Deft_Thought> I can't believe they made a Decapre model and didn't bring her in
[0:12:05] <dds333a> yeah LUL
[0:12:11] <%Deft_Thought> @dds333a Oh. All right. I guess that's something.
[0:12:14] <NeoNeonNero> woolie, they also pushed Nacali hard and he was a fcking JOBBER in the story
[0:12:20] <+TopTieramisu> the fact that G didn't have a proper story seems wrong
[0:12:26] <lazerscraper> the one time i would have wanted decapre over whoever the fuck luke is
[0:12:27] <leith_aziz> I think after Ono left, a lot of plans for SFV got canned
[0:12:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> woolieYIKES
[0:12:34] <%Deft_Thought> Man, Necalli.
[0:12:38] <+sonofthedeepsouth> good good emote
[0:12:40] <+TopTieramisu> they were gassing up G so much and then he just had a lame arcade mode-type story
[0:12:42] <%Deft_Thought> What a waste of a cool lookin dude
[0:12:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Best emote
[0:12:44] <dds333a> @toptieramisu hard agree
[0:12:49] <+sonofthedeepsouth> woolieYIKES
[0:12:49] <lazerscraper> Necalli is the biggest dropped ball holy shit
[0:12:51] <leith_aziz> @TopTieramisu G seems teased for 6. He's a pretty popular chharaacter
[0:12:53] <BalloniWright> Abel is in SFV story but never got in
[0:12:54] <+sonofthedeepsouth> best lore also
[0:13:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Based fuck it motivation
[0:13:25] <NeoNeonNero> @Deft_Thought Right?! They did him dirty!
[0:13:29] <Eger007> 2022: revenge of the omikron
[0:13:31] <dds333a> they brought everybody
[0:13:35] <%DashXero> There were too many characters in Story Mode.
[0:13:38] <leith_aziz> Honestly, arcade sections aint bad either. You can do a lot with them. Xrd's Episode mode is my favorite
[0:13:41] <Afrosamasenpai> He was!
[0:13:41] <%DashXero> Laura had no business being there.
[0:13:44] <%Solidnick18> he was in the story
[0:13:45] <PKSomething> PETER
[0:13:47] <lazerscraper> PETER
[0:13:51] <+nolawg> Reggie lookin like Blanka more than Woolie
[0:13:53] <dds333a> PETER
[0:13:53] <Afrosamasenpai> He was possessed. You punch the evil out of him.
[0:13:56] <+TopTieramisu> i want the lore on juri's magic motorbike that can travel from brazil to london
[0:13:58] <NeoNeonNero> PETER FOR SFVI!!
[0:14:02] <lazerscraper> Abel was not a fight in story mode
[0:14:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Hey peter remember that time?
[0:14:02] <%Solidnick18> not fightable
[0:14:05] <leith_aziz> You get an intro cutscene, middle point and an ending that links to the story
[0:14:10] <%jinking79> he wasn't
[0:14:12] <dds333a> @toptieramisu flying mind you LUL
[0:14:21] <%Solidnick18> just he popped and it led to nothing
[0:14:27] <%Solidnick18> up*
[0:14:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> "Peter remember that time you were a cop in SFV?"
[0:14:39] <lazerscraper> apparently in credits fucking Combofiend voiced eng Peter??
[0:14:43] <dds333a> nice fucking job T.Hawk
[0:14:47] <+TopTieramisu> seth killian got a boss character, peter rosas got a security guard
[0:14:50] <+BigNerdSam> Ono was insane. Still is insane if his tweets about Melty Blood are worth anything.
[0:14:54] <%jinking79> one Doll die
[0:14:58] <BackwardCap> Cammy put that poor old man into an early retirement.
[0:14:59] <leith_aziz> Let's see if 6 aint afraid to move past 3rd Strike
[0:15:03] <NewDonkKing> poster boy and protag are not the necessarily the same thing
[0:15:10] <Afrosamasenpai> it's real cute art
[0:15:16] <leith_aziz> FYI you can have several protaagonists
[0:15:21] <%Deft_Thought> Them Popeye arms are gonna take some getting used to
[0:15:23] <leith_aziz> Posterboy is a different thing
[0:15:27] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> anima is the protagonist in Tekken 7 kinda LUL
[0:15:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[0:15:41] <+TopTieramisu> capcom loves their blonde protagonists
[0:15:41] <+FuqBoiSlim> yeah like Terry is on all the KOF promo but the protagonist for XV is That Kid
[0:16:00] <leith_aziz> @FuqBoiSlim Yep. Terry hasnt been the protagonist for a while
[0:16:03] <+TopTieramisu> guile, nash, alex, abel, and now this new dude
[0:16:06] <%Solidnick18> maybe
[0:16:08] <leith_aziz> Bu the's the "posterboy"
[0:16:10] <lazerscraper> Bring Back Deejay. for his Vtrigger let him shrink

[0:16:23] <+TopTieramisu> of course he's not a protagonist in kof
[0:16:26] <dds333a> @fuqboislim being a crossover, terry has been all over the marketing since '94 LUL
[0:16:33] <+TopTieramisu> kof protags are kof originals
[0:16:33] <lazerscraper> now that i think about it, luke feels like White Deejay
[0:16:34] <leith_aziz> I'd saay Terry's the protagonist in Fatal Fury
[0:16:50] <BackwardCap> Luke is the first character they're pushing as the new face since Alex, and its going about as well as it did back then gildedSmug
[0:16:57] <dds333a> @leith_aziz yeah, he's never been the protagonist of a single kof game
[0:17:08] <leith_aziz> @dds333a Damn, not a single one?
[0:17:08] <dds333a> and by garou, Rock is the protag
[0:17:18] <NeoNeonNero> Woolie, who they push doesn't matter. Remember Necalli?
[0:17:26] <%Prevot> wonder if 6 is gonna bring back Sean and make him not suck
[0:17:31] <+FuqBoiSlim> yeah but like imagine if Shun'ei got into Ult instead of Terry. I would've fucked with it tbh
[0:17:35] <leith_aziz> I felt like Rock and Terry shared the rptag spot in that game. Terry played the mentor character
[0:17:36] <lazerscraper> terry turns into dmc4/5 dante for rock's nero in garou
[0:17:50] <leith_aziz> *protag
[0:18:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Time to oil up
[0:18:06] <NeoNeonNero> Watch Luke be another Abel or Rashid and not matter in the end
[0:18:08] <leith_aziz> Hakan was pretty goofy, I wouldnt mind him coming back
[0:18:15] <Afrosamasenpai> RIP Best Oil Boy
[0:18:17] <%jinking79> poor Hakan
[0:18:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Nah Woolie it would be great
[0:18:19] <dds333a> LUL
[0:18:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Fuck grapplers
[0:18:25] <leith_aziz> He's way too funny not leaave behind even if he's pretty stereotypical
[0:18:25] <%DashXero> Strong, but that sounds REALLY interesting.
[0:18:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Grapplers deserve nothing. Take the blankets from their children
[0:18:48] <%Solidnick18> juri PogChamp
[0:18:49] <+TopTieramisu> hakan and his genetic lego hair
[0:18:55] <%Solidnick18> woolieGASM
[0:18:56] <+TopTieramisu> juri's here to stay
[0:18:57] <PKSomething> @sonofthedeepsouth @scrubquotes
[0:18:57] <leith_aziz> Shame C.Viper didnt come back. Nice though that she showed up in MVC3
[0:19:02] <Afrosamasenpai> Look at this Anti-Grappler Propaganda
[0:19:07] <Afrosamasenpai> how dare
[0:19:08] <dds333a> @toptieramisu all his kids LUL
[0:19:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> let's hope Menat comes back Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:19:22] <%Solidnick18> Juri is here to stay with all the dlc outfits they gave her LUL
[0:19:24] <%DashXero> Or, if they tech, they deal damage.
[0:19:27] <%jinking79> Oil up but u can't Dash regularly
[0:19:39] <lazerscraper> Bring the fuck back Necalli and actually make him work for a majority of SF6
[0:19:50] <Jetsfantasy> @Afrosamasenpai They play zoners, don't mind them Kappa
[0:19:51] <lazerscraper> Im mad they dropped the ball on him for mbison AGAIN
[0:19:54] <dds333a> @lazerscraper you're insane
[0:19:55] <Aaronc123425> @sonofthedeepsouth that some real hatred right there lol
[0:19:57] <+TopTieramisu> necalli's ruined
[0:20:05] <+TopTieramisu> just do another attempt at the pillarmen
[0:20:07] <Afrosamasenpai> @jinking79 oil up and you trip
[0:20:09] <PKSomething> they wont bring back necalli cause it would just be embarassing
[0:20:14] <BalloniWright> There is something about his dad
[0:20:15] <%Qsmash_> why would he be Captain Comando?
[0:20:17] <lazerscraper> @dds333a Kappa
[0:20:26] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> devour our our
[0:20:27] <leith_aziz> Sorry for you Necalli fans. He got screwed by jobbing the same way Kotal did
[0:20:34] <Afrosamasenpai> @Jetsfantasy Zoners. All over the shop. Sooner or later you'll be one too.
[0:20:48] <dds333a> @lazerscraper you know, you've won me over SeemsGood
[0:21:01] <%jinking79> Luke could just be Captain Commander father or Grandfather
[0:21:03] <+TopTieramisu> kotal kahn has backstory and a love interest. don't put him on the same level as necalli
[0:21:03] <lazerscraper> @dds333a i never had hopes, im just pissed that design is going to waste because of fuckin story lol
[0:21:09] <+TopTieramisu> necalli is a nothing character
[0:21:11] <NeoNeonNero> his normal costume is fcking lame compared to his other ones
[0:21:14] <%Qsmash_> captain commando just wears one star no?
[0:21:20] <NeoNeonNero> it's so boring

[0:40:42] <+TopTieramisu> does this game have any lore?
[0:40:48] <gemseekingwolf> is this retro, or modern?
[0:40:52] <%Prevot> Pit vs Dark Pit
[0:40:57] <Reionder> @TopTieramisu the lore is that they are in Brazil
[0:41:01] <+TopTieramisu> is it just a big catholic fighter?
[0:41:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> The only thing I don't like about Cristiano is his pants. It looks like he's wearing boxers over his pants or something
[0:41:03] <+Felhad> modern
[0:41:03] <NeoNeonNero> The intro said: "Who are you" "I am you but without hypocrisy"
[0:41:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> It is the fest junina stage. Where is my Caipira Cake

[0:42:45] <sylyvie> funny that Christiano B side is basically Belial, he gets excited getting beaten LUL
[0:43:06] <%Prevot> I guess they made these b-sides cause they spent so much on these sprites LUL
[0:43:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> @sonofthedeepsouth the voice clips are too low, so I can't quite tell, but is he???
[0:43:09] <aka_Jigawatt> the sounds effects are so satisfying
[0:43:14] <ChoculaUltra> that "ha ha haaaa" of his is infectious
[0:43:22] <+TopTieramisu> it's interesting that this game gave the dudes more naturalistic physiques
[0:43:39] <Reionder> @TopTieramisu "naturalistic"
[0:43:44] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Fun Fact: Lucy Fernandez started as an original MUGEN character. I'm ASSUMING whoever made her is working on this game.

[1:33:09] <Mibeador> Malakh is like Morrigan crossed with Dizzy. Two airdashes, Morrigan dash, low damage and air fireball

[1:34:29] <%BestSakuyaNA> Most of the fun is when you figure out how to abuse your character's technical/assault meter, you just get FRC combos for days.
[1:34:30] <+TopTieramisu> that was hype
[1:34:33] <%townzzzzz> wooooooooo
[1:34:33] <+Kataiser> Comebacks

[1:35:55] <dds333a> @toptieramisu so, like always LUL
[1:36:06] <Arqartur0> @DSD24 but that Elbow Drop, tho!
[1:36:12] <+TopTieramisu> i wish blue mary got that kind of love in her model
[1:36:24] <DSD24> @Arqartur0 Oh yeah that's my only complaint Angel looks great
[1:36:25] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like angel looks more toned than blue mary does in 15
[1:36:37] <DSD24> @TopTieramisu We need more abs in general
[1:36:47] <+TopTieramisu> i want blue mary's glorious back muscles back

[1:38:26] <DSD24> Aside from the pants Kasumi has a good design
[1:38:33] <Mibeador> everyone has the same health, Kasumi does good damage but she requires rejump combos and shit
[1:38:40] <Gmanblack> Goodbye booba
[1:38:41] <DingusMcBaseball> @WoolieVersus i think HCB + D activates their lvl 3s
[1:38:43] <+Kataiser> Kasumi's got probably the worst approach options in the game, but her BnB combos are loooooong.
[1:38:46] <%townzzzzz> koko desuka
[1:38:48] <Arqartur0> I bet that angel is the Boss Character

[1:45:21] <TigerClaws12> main booba

[1:47:17] <neowave607> this game doesn't look so bad, honestly. Would be nice if it was 60fps tho.
[1:47:18] <%BestSakuyaNA> She's fun
[1:47:27] <KainZero0> Warc
[1:47:28] <%BestSakuyaNA> Lots of combos that loop you back and forth across the stage

[1:47:47] <DSD24> That was a sick thrown
[1:47:49] <%fetrigon> holy shit
[1:47:58] <%BestSakuyaNA> Kakeru is good if you like to be losing for half the game and then 60% them in 1 stand combo lol
[1:47:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:48:14] <dds333a> @bestsakuyana I've seen it LUL
[1:48:35] <PleaseStayLucid> Where does one find this game, I'm tryign to look for it but its not exactly easy to find so far :/
[1:48:37] <+Kataiser> Red is negative penalty.
[1:49:38] <Arqartur0> @Kataiser so it's a positive?.
[1:49:42] <DSD24> So many belts
[1:49:58] <legacy0117> Dem claws.
[1:50:01] <%BestSakuyaNA> Red = you're running away too much so you take bonus damage iirc. Kataiser might remember better than me.
[1:50:02] <DSD24> Wow its Vash
[1:50:05] <dds333a> @arqartur0 LUL
[1:50:08] <Pt_Kamen> it's Vash

[1:50:11] <%DashXero> It's just Vash.
[1:50:18] <%BestSakuyaNA> Hardy is the man, his combos are super satisfying
[1:50:19] <%townzzzzz> almost vash like
[1:50:23] <Arqartur0> Old Man Vash
[1:50:24] <+Kataiser> @Arqartur0 Take more damage, chip % increased, and your move speed reduces.
[1:50:29] <Mibeador> yeah this game has negative penalty, but it's really easy to make go away
[1:50:32] <neowave607> That guy looks like anime Willem Dafoe
[1:50:38] <%jinking79> all the triguns
[1:50:42] <Duskendawn> Discount wild arms protag
[1:50:48] <%BestSakuyaNA> Kasumi has good damage once you learn her rejump combos but it takes practice.
[1:50:52] <DSD24> Work for those combos
[1:50:56] <+Kataiser> Kasumi has rekkas and very long combos with rad relaunches.
[1:51:14] <%BestSakuyaNA> Also you can rekka Hardy's guns

[1:59:42] <Super_Voltekka> Blodia is also a secret character in the Dreamcast port of Tech Romancer
[1:59:44] <Kenny_Riot> It's also a sequel to a beat-em-up, so hey
[1:59:47] <dds333a> yep
[1:59:48] <@Solidus_113> time is passing
[1:59:57] <Duskendawn> 95 damn

[2:00:08] <+TungstenViper> JIN SAOTOME
[2:00:18] <%Joe2187> Is this just the mechs from Armored Warriors beat em up arcade game?
[2:00:23] <dds333a> LUL
[2:00:26] <GeltonZ> @Joe2187 Yup
[2:00:35] <Kenny_Riot> @Joe2187 That's exactly what it is
[2:00:37] <dds333a> the years with the GOOD logo
[2:00:51] <legacy0117> Also I think I saw a part fell off during a match, do the mechs come apart?
[2:00:56] <%jinking79> and then u got all those SNK games
[2:01:18] <txcforever> just search for a list for cps1-2-3 games.
[2:01:21] <@Solidus_113> there's the capcom fandom wiki
[2:01:28] <@Solidus_113> https://capcom.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Video_games_by_year
[2:01:29] <txcforever> Most of them were fighting games or beat em ups anyway
[2:01:33] <Kenny_Riot> America got Armored Warriors, I don't think we ever got Cyberbots. Most Americans know Jin & Blodia from their guest appearances than their source

[2:20:57] <SaltyAzteca> Devilotte is a story character, I think youd need cheats to play as her @Xero_J
[2:23:16] <%townzzzzz> your leg type determines your boost type
[2:23:31] <ditalos> someone needs to take Super Robot Wars and just make it a fighting game
[2:23:46] <Jetsfantasy> Cyberbots x Titanfall: The Fighters

[2:24:04] <+Damie904> Dude I hard disagree with Woolie. We could use a fighting game that works more like this.
[2:24:52] <GeltonZ> @ditalos There was one but it was really bad. Could use a do-over.
[2:25:32] <GeltonZ> @Damie904 I'd say Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots Arena is kinda like this. You mix and match parts and each part has moves. It's a shockingly good game too.
[2:25:59] <%townzzzzz> run the flames
[2:26:40] <lavaking1997> Hey wooloo have you checked out srw 30 yet

[2:49:40] <Super_Voltekka> Isn't it sad that the only legal way to play this game nowadays is either Capcom Arcade Stadium without online multiplayer or that dodgy-ass """""cabinet""""" with stolen code?
[2:51:04] <%DashXero> In some ways, I wonder if this game was too ahead of its time to accomplish its full potential.
