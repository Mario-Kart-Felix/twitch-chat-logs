[0:11:37] <prime_name> Z?
[0:11:38] <gustavozxd> my mom bought me a 3ds with X/Y and I exchanged it for nintendogs and I don't regret it LUL
[0:11:39] <chronoxgp> they're too easy, and then torwards the end almost too hard without poitions
[0:11:40] <%jinking79> better than playing the card game
[0:11:41] <%robobeau> I pretty much bailed on Sun/Moon because I knew I'd be too burnt out to play a proper one on the Switch if finished Sun/Moon
[0:11:43] <%fatal_penguin_> I tolerated 2nd Gen, but that's as far as I could go.
[0:11:50] <DXLelouch24> Woolie you played the worst Pokemon he'll yiu didn't even play gen 3
[0:11:51] <+NoKingArthur> @WoolieVersus play soul silver instead

[0:17:30] <%Kavtech> I really want to see more of Babylon's Fall, it's been a whole year since the announcement trailer.
[0:17:47] <laguerrilha> yep
[0:17:55] <gustavozxd> oh man Witcher 3 LP would be longer than Kotor LUL
[0:17:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[0:18:03] <ManOfReason> Oh it’s very hard anime
[0:18:08] <Dragon_Batman> LUL so no anime?
[0:18:09] <Cherokia666> That's 100% what Woolie is saying
[0:18:17] <LBC921> Hey woolie, what did you think about this year e3?
[0:18:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie hates Anime Confirmed Kappa
[0:18:33] <Dragon_Batman> It's sci-fi anime?
[0:18:34] <gigacanuck> also 2B's ass
[0:18:36] <$cherubs_anonymous> It's not saturated
[0:18:36] <Cherokia666> he does, he just likes mechs
[0:18:39] <artoflec> Moe, the "cute" proportions
[0:18:43] <+zanzibar_junker> Woolie read Dungeon Meshi
[0:18:45] <gigacanuck> god damn, 2B's ass
[0:18:49] <masterfire23> woolie is trying to reject his weeb
[0:18:55] <+bbHighvalor> woolie actually hated gurren
[0:19:02] <Jackomaning> I liked playing MonHun and thinking how anime it was and then playing God Eater and realizing how far I had to go
[0:19:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It looks generic anime you mean
[0:19:06] <ManOfReason> Only the characters are anime in Nier not the world entirely
[0:19:07] <GentlemenWalrus> Woolie the fake weeb
[0:19:11] <Man_in_the_Red> theres full generic anime, then anime design applied to normal modelling and shading
[0:19:26] <Dragon_Batman> There is a small bit of character customization.
[0:19:29] <IndoorSitup> Astral Chain has a character creator by the way.
[0:19:36] <$cherubs_anonymous> The words you guys are looking for is "Light Novel aesthetic"
[0:19:42] <+zanzibar_junker> Still anime as fuck
[0:19:43] <artoflec> well Astral Chain has a character creator so that might be why their design is pretty basic right now artofl1Hmm
[0:19:44] <laguerrilha> the protagonists look band and boring. default anime guy/girl
[0:19:49] <Man_in_the_Red> @cherubs_anonymous thats a good word for it
[0:19:51] <masterfire23> astral chain just need a to be a jojo game ,fixed
[0:19:54] <+HiroTSK5> Woolie likes 90's Anime, not modern Anime
[0:19:55] <Ashenik1> is avatar an anime?? :?
[0:20:00] <gustavozxd> so you can make a super weirdo!?
[0:20:01] <laguerrilha> but he stands look great
[0:20:02] <+Zayasu> f
[0:20:06] <Man_in_the_Red> @ashenik1 no
[0:20:09] <%Solidnick18> um
[0:20:10] <%robobeau> F
[0:20:16] <ManOfReason> @cherubs_anonymous holyg shit you are so right
[0:20:19] <laguerrilha> @Ashenik1 no
[0:20:20] <+KinguinHD> Did hey already play senior
[0:20:23] <+TDotGoat> 0.5 FPS
[0:20:27] <+KinguinHD> SEKIRO
[0:20:34] <%GohanEgret> just started
[0:20:35] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you can change up the avatar character. I don't think by a huge degree though
[0:20:37] <gustavozxd> Hopefully astral chain character creator doesn't have the awful black color skin that some anime games have where it's a jank tan
[0:20:40] <alexandrecau> native tongue
[0:20:43] <+KinguinHD> thx
[0:20:45] <$cherubs_anonymous> Overexposure is a damned thing
[0:21:00] <%jinking79> too much Jojo part 8
[0:21:01] <Ashenik1> why, is is just because it wasnt made in japan ?
[0:21:12] <artoflec> the new Tales game is pretty different looking, looks more like Granblue or something
[0:21:23] <IndoorSitup> Woolie hates weeb shit confimed.
[0:21:24] <gustavozxd> Tales of arise does look way more generic than others
[0:21:30] <Dragon_Batman> I think they made a black dude in the nintendo tree house first day
[0:21:31] <prime_name> That's a bit limiting view on things.

[0:21:49] <artoflec> @gustavozxd check out the Treehouse Astral Chain playthrough they make a black character there
[0:21:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I understand that feel
[0:22:08] <laguerrilha> Yeah, the only bad part of Japanese game design is making the protagonist look generic so people can insert themselves
[0:22:17] <artoflec> I think Tales of Arise looks incredible, environment and creatures mostly, teh character design has always been pretty generic
[0:22:20] <gustavozxd> goddamn Kirito
[0:22:21] <AncelDeLambert> yes, it's a gemstone
[0:22:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yes?
[0:22:23] <chronoxgp> it's the dye of blu
[0:22:24] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:22:27] <DrBeanie> because it's a gemstone
[0:22:28] <laguerrilha> Yes, its a gem
[0:22:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOOLIE
[0:22:29] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it's an actual thing

[0:23:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Big Reveal, every single Gem in Steven Universe is an ACTUAL gemstone.

[0:23:20] <Kristoffers> an amethyst is also a gem
[0:23:21] <alrobot2014> woolie was able to hard dodge minecraft

[0:52:36] <+lemuhollow> @WoolieVersus Got to Ashina Castle to get the Umbrella, it IS missable if you go too late
[0:52:37] <%jinking79> in a house
[0:52:40] <cheffailure> Jump down into a building.
[0:52:47] <cheffailure> Hole in a building roof
[0:52:52] <Jackomaning> Hidden is a strong word
[0:53:01] <Dragon_Batman> You just happened to not go down that path
[0:53:03] <Tenchi_G> Look with house with broken roof. Black hat dwarf
[0:53:27] <+Keyd00d> optional =/= missable
[0:53:31] <mrhooppaw> nothing sold is missable because of the item box in the hub.

[0:56:50] <Dragon_Batman> He does not have that death blow no
[0:56:51] <天使42199> @chronoxgp he aint at senpo
[0:56:53] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah
[0:56:53] <%MeAuntieNora> Is that one of Jim Sterling's Boglins
[0:56:54] <%jinking79> ok so Woolie will buy it or Loot off his corpes
[0:57:02] <%wolfofsound> royal authority rats? Nah Imperial authority rats
[0:57:07] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> AA DB is awesome when you get the chance to use it
[0:57:11] <NeroInfinite> Iron Fortress
[0:57:13] <+ontoue> Is Rat the polite term
[0:57:25] <worldbrand> it's so satisfying but pretty situational
[0:57:36] <cheffailure> Iron fortress baby.
[0:57:38] <Dragon_Batman> You really got to find the moves for some enemies but it's really good when you do it

[0:59:48] <+linSP> i LOVE the antiair for certain enemies
[0:59:49] <%Kavtech> That might be one of the best passive abilities in the game.
[1:00:06] <Dragon_Batman> Other than deathblow life gain
[1:00:07] <Djinnazz> catch them mother fucker leapin.
[1:00:07] <cheffailure> He'll be back here after it's done.
[1:00:53] <%Solidnick18> yep
[1:01:01] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yooo
[1:01:09] <+ontoue> did woolie fight the boss at the end of senpou
[1:01:19] <%WailfulOmnivore> WailfulOmnivore subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:01:21] <Dragon_Batman> no
[1:01:26] <Dragon_Batman> for that boss
[1:01:30] <Spagheddies> Oh man, the skill that's only circumstantially useful and even when it is useful it's crazy hard to pull off.
[1:01:55] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yeah I've done one anti air kill the whole game
[1:02:03] <gslayer14> i've never used it, is there a specific enemy type it's good for?
[1:02:09] <NukeDaHippies> it's dope as hell tho, eapecially agaunst tgw ghost sharman
[1:02:13] <Spagheddies> The Helicopter Monks
[1:02:14] <RyuuAoi> We still in this bitch!
[1:02:20] <Jackomaning> Threres a few @gslayer14
[1:02:24] <%Solidnick18> that blackhat
[1:02:27] <Spagheddies> But, again, it's VERY unreliable.
[1:02:31] <%Kavtech> @EddieMayNot I'll personally disagree on both angles. It's useful for a whole level and the enemies you use it on are predictable.
[1:02:35] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> You can really hurt the Shichimen warriors with it
[1:02:44] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yeah most enemies that jump you can use it on but the timing and spacing seems picky
[1:02:51] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:03:02] <Dragon_Batman> I found it pretty easy to use for the enemies in the last area at least
[1:03:15] <BabyNaBackbrace> Mostly I just knock guys out of the air and slash 'em up
[1:03:18] <cheffailure> Senpou Temple time
[1:03:22] <Frolomeo> More like shadows die at least 400 times
[1:03:27] <DianaTheAscian> KonCha
[1:04:02] <+Zayasu> KonCha
[1:04:16] <BabyNaBackbrace> I'm currently stuck at what I suspect is the last boss
[1:04:22] <NDenizen> It blocks grabs
[1:04:28] <Sarumarine> I really liked the Iron Umbrella
[1:04:35] <gslayer14> IT BLOCKS GRABS?!?
[1:04:36] <%robobeau> And you can eventually upgrade it to deal with the Headless
[1:04:40] <$Louie_Salmon> Well, much less after the update
[1:04:40] <KasiCrafter> One emblem for each deploy?
[1:04:53] <LTKonnor> Oh no, Woolie found the shield of this game
[1:05:00] <BabyNaBackbrace> I had it upgraded to block Headless right after dealing with my last Headless
[1:05:02] <Frolomeo> Which arm tool leads to a German suplex with a bridge?
[1:05:05] <Spagheddies> The iron umbrella is pretty useful. The fact that it can parry too is also pretty neat if not too useful.
[1:05:35] <NeroInfinite> IT's an ez mode parry
[1:05:35] <RyuuAoi> !uptime
[1:05:35] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 10 minutes
[1:05:41] <Dragon_Batman> The skill where you attack of it is pretty dope too
[1:05:59] <Jackomaning> @BabyNaBackbrace Can you whisper me which boss? I won't confirm or deny its the last one if you dont want, just curious
[1:06:01] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:06:07] <%jinking79> Woolie will never be able to guess that last tool
[1:07:00] <Spagheddies> That'd be a fun weapon in a musou game.

[1:07:38] <gustavozxd> masamune date in Sengoku Basara with the wolwerine claw but KATANAS
[1:07:48] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus what about those dudes from naruto that gaara killed
[1:07:57] <gustavozxd> or Tadakatsu Honda who is just a fucking mecha
[1:08:06] <%jinking79> it a good anime, the movie hit or miss
[1:08:09] <CureMode666> we need woolie to play persona 5
[1:08:20] <gustavozxd> Sengoku Basara man we need more of those localised
[1:08:29] <+zanzibar_junker> Woolie which ending is better Escaflowne or GoT?
[1:08:50] <+zanzibar_junker> Or worse
[1:09:09] <Maids4lyfe> Escaflowne had an ending?
[1:09:33] <vodonne1> Hidetaka Miyazaki said in an interview in like 2016-2017 that he would like to make a mech fantasy game and he used Escaflowne as an example
[1:09:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Time to parry
[1:09:47] <Djinnazz> aww
[1:09:50] <Maids4lyfe> Mech Souls
[1:10:14] <%robobeau> This is literally the "learn to parry" fight
[1:10:19] <Spagheddies> Alternatively, Armored Core
[1:10:25] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Feel that rhythm!
[1:10:34] <Spagheddies> which I am still waiting for From why do you make me suffer
[1:10:37] <duraju> its more like a mash parry fight
[1:10:46] <RAH001> he did da thing!
[1:10:51] <天使42199> this boss builds his posture himself all you is block/deflect a little LUL
[1:10:54] <%robobeau> Yeah basically, mash parry
[1:10:57] <%robobeau> It's not great
[1:10:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YEYEY
[1:11:00] <+griffball13> i clapped when he used it
[1:11:06] <%Solidnick18> so ez
[1:11:14] <chronoxgp> I don't understand why people have so much trouble with this system it's just a stamina bar with two sides
[1:11:17] <gigacanuck> if only you'd gotten off that stealth attack
[1:11:26] <%Solidnick18> yes
[1:11:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:11:29] <laserbeaming> Practice those blockstrings
[1:11:31] <duraju> if only...
[1:11:32] <Sarumarine> Skill check boss
[1:11:32] <biggdaddymike> Spam the parry button like never before Woolie
[1:11:32] <BabyNaBackbrace> this fight's making my hands sweat
[1:11:39] <biggdaddymike> This is a skill check
[1:11:40] <Jackomaning> this fight is so fun
[1:11:40] <%Solidnick18> then he does a big one you jump on his head
[1:11:43] <%wolfofsound> he's the best at what he does, but he only does one thing LUL
[1:11:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he literally exists to test your parry mash
[1:11:46] <+josiiph> LUL LUL LUL
[1:11:46] <Dragon_Batman> He doesn't remember Giraffe, or did he even fight Giraffe
[1:11:49] <gslayer14> 2 moves but they're both winners
[1:11:52] <duraju> yeyeyeye
[1:11:54] <ThDark> MIssing those good head jumps, but he's easy enough even without em
[1:12:00] <castcola> yeeee
[1:12:01] <%Solidnick18> yep
[1:12:04] <+josiiph> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:12:20] <duraju> im assuming he hasn't fought the other one yet?
[1:12:21] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> It's so simple once it clicks. Just 1-2-3-4 pause 1-2-3-4-5 pause 1. But it is intimidating the first time.
[1:12:22] <%robobeau> I died way too many times to that dude
[1:12:32] <RyuuAoi> Man...FUCK KONAMI.
[1:12:40] <+griffball13> remember your in air counter when you see the sweep coming
[1:12:57] <gustavozxd> idk what happened but indeed fuck Konami
[1:13:08] <%komradedog> immortal blade time next?
[1:13:08] <laserbeaming> You know, I always forget how Mihn looks like and I'm kinda surprised every time I see him on streal LUL
[1:13:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> now look at this room full of corpses
[1:13:34] <BabyNaBackbrace> Big secret: jump in that fire
[1:14:11] <Dragon_Batman> Nothing can really stop you from using the monk skills a lot
[1:14:11] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:14:15] <gigacanuck> no passives?
[1:14:18] <gustavozxd> oh man I hope nioh has actual martial arts
[1:14:19] <RyuuAoi> @gustavozxd Just reminiscing on their BS. We lost SO MUCH.
[1:14:26] <RyuuAoi> ...FUCK
[1:14:33] <+linSP> drop your sword!
[1:14:52] <gslayer14> Immaculate!
[1:15:16] <giogio346> this game has no depth
[1:15:18] <duraju> yea, they could've made L1+R2 be another skill
[1:15:18] <+pkmamsters> cum it
[1:15:22] <Djinnazz> they/re realy good.
[1:15:28] <Patzzki217> it sucks that sekiro is so short and its the only souls like game that really hooked me in
[1:16:06] <%jinking79> monk's skills help counter against enemy's sweep attack
[1:16:12] <laserbeaming> I don't like Sekiro's moveset that much.
[1:16:18] <chronoxgp> sekiro is just as long as the other games, it's not short
[1:16:19] <gigacanuck> you get a sense of satisfaction
[1:16:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> I'm trying to get my brother into souls. What game should I recommend to him?
[1:16:42] <LTKonnor> @doc_ock_rokc Dark Souls 2 Kappa
[1:16:45] <laserbeaming> Souls 1, if he can tolerate the Jank
[1:16:54] <laserbeaming> Dark Souls, I mean
[1:17:09] <Dragon_Batman> I would agree, give him tips too
[1:17:16] <gustavozxd> probably bloodborne? That seems to be the most loved one, other than ds1 I guess
[1:17:19] <BabyNaBackbrace> It's got limitations but it's interesting hearing everyone's different experiences in the game, like what tools and techniques you use
[1:17:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> Have they talked about Elden Rings yet
[1:17:33] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> DaS1 is good for a start; or even DeS if you want to go really old school. Depending on his style of play Bloodborne could also be viable.
[1:17:48] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think we'll be seeing Elden Rings for a good while, if not TGS
[1:17:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> My brother is all about "I don't wanna play a game that is too hard" I recommened bloodborne which he has for free on his PS4 but he won't play it

[1:18:33] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe play with your brother?, it might be better if he isn't alone?
[1:18:37] <laserbeaming> Dark Souls 1 is not really that hard. I'd say it's a good start.
[1:18:40] <%jinking79> alright Puzzle Time
[1:18:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @天使42199 He would own the fact that he is a bitch and a coward

[1:19:18] <BabyNaBackbrace> I heard a lot of people saying Flowing Passage wasn't a good skill, but until I got second-tier Senpou skills I almost used it exclusively
[1:19:18] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> @doc_ock_rokc Consider DaS 1 then. A shield and some other items can help ease the difficulty. Or just use magic, I suppose.

[1:41:22] <ScottyAF> Lower your shield @WoolieVersus
[1:41:23] <generalve> Woolie VS. Sekiro puzzle part 01
[1:41:23] <meromaromiro> I'm willing to laugh at woolie all night
[1:41:25] <%robobeau> Here's how to improve the stream: Play the Benny Hill theme throughout this entire area
[1:41:26] <%jinking79> it really hard to upset us
[1:41:28] <$Rezca> No, this boss is frustrating in a different way
[1:41:29] <Heyestus> ! BOREDSTRATESET !
[1:41:31] <MonstarGrrrl> woolie take my energy \ Kappa /
[1:41:32] <BabyNaBackbrace> It's an opportunity for folks to stretch their legs, or maybe eat some dinner
[1:41:36] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> This is just my background noise while tinkering with things, I kinda like it.
[1:41:36] <jubejube56> Stream is okay with 3 hours of puzzles
[1:41:40] <Dingo_Eejit> What are we looking for? how (not) cryptic can we be?
[1:41:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie is a FGC man. Which means his head and brickwalls are friends
[1:41:46] <%jinking79> this is the best time right now
[1:41:47] <Slimeking_Mike> We're far less upset than we're pretending to be
[1:41:52] <Kghaleon> Liam just brute forced this section
[1:41:53] <RyuuAoi> Apologetic Woolie? NO. Woolie WILL figure it out!
[1:41:56] <generalve> I'm okay with this woolie it's a very Nice ASMR experience and calming
[1:41:57] <NDenizen> the [enemy stand] is still a secret
[1:42:03] <rad_dude123465> I don’t really blame Woolie for have trouble, this “boss” kinda sucks ass
[1:42:07] <KeiPrime> bongggg
[1:42:12] <+bubbli97> i wonder if woolie will figure out the last monkey
[1:42:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus If it gets long we weill just start singing Evanescence
[1:42:16] <%robobeau> It took me about an hour, because I didn't realize the gimmick that ONE monkey... You know the one...
[1:42:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:42:21] <laserbeaming> It's a pretty bad puzzle boss
[1:42:27] <+griffball13> does that bell even do anything?
[1:42:37] <MonstarGrrrl> !motivated
[1:42:37] <@Moobot> 403 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:42:38] <+G_Thunders> Headphones helped out a lot for this
[1:42:38] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Pookiedaexzile puzzles are an infinite combo loop until you work out the frame trap.
[1:42:45] <gunsrlove> eh, it isn't that bad
[1:42:45] <Dingo_Eejit> Ask not for who the puzzle fails, it fails for thee!
[1:42:48] <RyuuAoi> Get outta your head, @woolieversus.KICK ARSE!
[1:42:49] <shadow1man9> @griffball13 It does but saying what it is is spoilers
[1:42:52] <Dragon_Batman> I think if you get the hearing monkey there and ring it he'll be stunned
[1:42:53] <Kghaleon> There's nothing wrong with this boss, they give you plenty of tips and practically every room is important here.
[1:42:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> If you ring it at the right time you can deafen the monkey for a short time
[1:42:54] <NDenizen> if the hearing monkey stands above the bell when its rung, it gets stunned
[1:43:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> but the timeing is hard
[1:43:02] <+griffball13> @shadow1man9 ah ok got it
[1:43:03] <gunsrlove> you have hints and stuff for each monkey and it gets easier once you do the thing first
[1:43:20] <NDenizen> some of the rooms the monkeys will wonder into and then just get stuck there
[1:43:22] <dodgy_dingo_> every from game has to have that 1 weird boss fight
[1:43:25] <+starzo0> @robobeau i almost forgot about him
[1:43:26] <Coffee_JD> at least try running after it...
[1:43:28] <generalve> this boss design feels like Miyazaki kind of smelled his farts on this one
[1:43:35] <Dragon_Batman> I would hope Woolie remembers that that mmonkey is the hearing one
[1:43:48] <generalve> overly and unnecessarily complicated
[1:43:49] <%Lion_kun> woolie keeps trying to stealth them but ti's not really the way to do it
[1:44:00] <%Promessa_EX> wooliePOYO
[1:44:12] <NDenizen> its not really complicated, they even put notes in each room explaining what they do
[1:44:16] <%DedlokPM> wooliePOYO
[1:44:18] <CalderGaming> let him figure it out
[1:44:24] <artoflec> yeah this fight is just kind of boring and gimmicky lol
[1:44:28] <chiazam> Ahhhhh this boss fight
[1:44:30] <+linSP> a hunter is a hunter even in a monkey dream
[1:44:32] <chronoxgp> no
[1:44:33] <+Zayasu> :O
[1:44:34] <Kghaleon> I tried stealthing the hearing monkey crouched with the sneaking pill, doesn't work at all.
[1:44:49] <laserbeaming> damn, just when I unsub, woolie adds wooliePOYO. Well, maybe next month
[1:44:49] <+G_Thunders> It’s not boring if you finish it in 10-15 minutes like normal...
[1:44:51] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 50 minutes
[1:44:54] <chiazam> How many attempts has he made?
[1:44:58] <BabyNaBackbrace> 100% Relaxed Billy
[1:45:05] <+linSP> OOOJ
[1:45:08] <zamzoph> so close NotLikeThis
[1:45:09] <artoflec> if this was 2 minutes it'd be a boring 2 minutes
[1:45:11] <NDenizen> juked by a monkey
[1:45:19] <Kghaleon> I want Minh to just fall asleep
[1:45:21] <gunsrlove> more shuriken
[1:45:24] <RyuuAoi> Billy smoked a blunt before stream. LEGALLY.
[1:45:24] <Dingo_Eejit> Chill Bill
[1:45:25] <artoflec> i like this game but would never defend this part
[1:45:26] <%fatal_penguin_> Woolie, try to remember some of the basics of CQC
[1:45:31] <%jinking79> these monkeys r like my cousins
[1:45:37] <anairis_q> damn, that’s closer than I ever got to green monkey without the bell
[1:45:41] <generalve> whomp whomp
[1:45:41] <RyuuAoi> @dingo_eejit Volume 2!
[1:45:43] <+linSP> them jukes
[1:45:45] <+starzo0> he might actually fall asleep, its happened before
[1:45:59] <duraju> endless cycle of woolie chasing monkeys
[1:46:04] <+stagemage> that monkey is laming it out just watching the timer. its a bit strange as woolie has the life lead
[1:46:09] <generalve> the monkeys are a bunch of bitch lasagnas
[1:46:09] <rad_dude123465> how do you feel about this boss on repeat play throughs? I think it’s alright on the first, but on repeats it feels like a huge slog
[1:46:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> Two Sessions Chat who wants the action
[1:46:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm taking all bets
[1:46:17] <NDenizen> "snake, those are the folding screen monkeys. watch out!"
[1:46:29] <gunsrlove> its a one trick kinda deal , real atmospheric at first
[1:46:34] <laserbeaming> LUL
[1:46:35] <0rond> on the repeat playtrhough you can watch basically "solutions"
[1:46:36] <gunsrlove> but then it's not as fun
[1:46:40] <+griffball13> remember woolie this is a sneaking mission Kappa
[1:46:49] <%fatal_penguin_> Talk about the best steak sides, Woolie
[1:46:53] <%Promessa_EX> thinking outloud is useful
[1:46:58] <G0DKnight> What about whispering?
[1:46:59] <+starzo0> thinking out loud is great
[1:47:03] <gslayer14> legitimate tip:put the bell on the hotbar until you win the fight
[1:47:05] <BabyNaBackbrace> Woolie you caught up on Jojo yet?
[1:47:08] <kdallas_> just kill them 4Head
[1:47:15] <anairis_q> whispering out loud

[2:12:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Everyone else is just trying to replicate that immortality but has bad side effects
[2:12:53] <Tisaric> Rice is OP
[2:12:56] <+Tearonex> SACRED RICE
[2:13:01] <castcola> delicious rice
[2:13:01] <Spagheddies> @WoolieVersus And also, the name for that specific blade is just "Fushigiri".
[2:13:05] <Dragon_Batman> LUL @wolfofsound
[2:13:06] <%fatal_penguin_> Fried rice?
[2:13:08] <+griffball13> there was a hungery old woman

[2:13:25] <BabyNaBackbrace> Then why not just eat one bite of rice then?
[2:13:25] <%robobeau> Get yourself some Puerto Rican white rice
[2:13:26] <%robobeau> That shit's fire
[2:13:27] <+Pookiedaexzile> He has no idea
[2:13:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Magic rice
[2:13:29] <gigacanuck> that sounds vaguely sexual

[2:13:34] <%fatal_penguin_> GUN TO YOUR HEAD WOOLIE: Best Rice?

[2:14:23] <Forgottenblade_> Kimari push is a hidden ability in this game
[2:14:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why is there a App called "Divine Right"
[2:14:30] <%robobeau> If you use it to dry out your iPhone, you will never sever the ties of iPhonetaility...
[2:14:35] <%robobeau> ...I'll see myself out...
[2:14:42] <+conqab> and you can trade it for hints
[2:14:45] <0rond> what? does she? isn't it based on time passing? i'm almost certain you can have more than one
[2:14:52] <gigacanuck> you must destroy your iPhone to be free of the curse of Apple
[2:14:53] <PinkSocks> You can get more if you just fast travel a lot
[2:14:55] <DXLelouch24> chat is stupid and things shes a centipede and didnt play the game
[2:14:56] <clapbeat> did he fight the guardian ape already?
[2:15:02] <DXLelouch24> nope

[2:15:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its a key item
[2:15:18] <Tisaric> It's just your sword now
[2:15:18] <clapbeat> its coming up right?
[2:15:19] <Graxe_> Should have a combat art with it now.

[2:16:23] <Forgottenblade_> Noob jk
[2:16:24] <Spagheddies> THE DOPEST LOOKING SKILL
[2:16:25] <DXLelouch24> Centipede Race War
[2:16:31] <Tisaric> it looks so fucking cool
[2:16:41] <%Solidnick18> it's so dope
[2:16:44] <+Pookiedaexzile> Minh is still hearing all those 3rd Birthday lyrics
[2:16:44] <+zanzibar_junker> Nah
[2:16:45] <%Solidnick18> no
[2:16:48] <Spagheddies> Nope, it just costs too many spirit emblems.
[2:16:48] <Dragon_Batman> No that's just dramatic flair
[2:16:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> and by lyrics
[2:16:50] <%Promessa_EX> no that would be cool
[2:16:51] <gslayer14> thatd be sick but no
[2:16:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> I mean moans
[2:16:51] <0rond> would have been useful if ichimonji wasn't so broken
[2:16:53] <%Solidnick18> what
[2:16:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It found you worthy now
[2:16:59] <castcola> it would be way more powerful if it took a node to just swing it lmao
[2:17:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> You died once for it, that's good enough
[2:17:03] <Graxe_> It kills you the first time.
[2:17:04] <Tisaric> that would've been a sick mechanic to explore
[2:17:06] <%wolfofsound> I thought he said erection not resurrection for a moment LUL
[2:17:06] <+InstiGaitan> shes the good kind of centipede
[2:17:11] <rasterman> That's how I thought it would work, but nope, spirit emblems
[2:17:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Okami Slash
[2:17:13] <+Skelemungus> lo
[2:17:18] <+conqab> it's just an attack, mang

[2:18:47] <CHVMPLOO> awoo
[2:18:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> Yif
[2:18:47] <+griffball13> never turn your back on the wolf pack
[2:18:51] <Mariakko> awoo
[2:18:54] <$Rezca> Can I get a stream with negative Arfing?
[2:18:55] <cheffailure> bork bork

[2:18:58] <gustavozxd> oh god stop

[2:19:04] <%robobeau> Woolie yiffing live on stream
[2:19:04] <+InstiGaitan> I am a wolf in all forms but physical
[2:19:05] <+InstiGaitan> arf
[2:19:05] <+Skelemungus> dmx?
[2:19:06] <castcola> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[2:19:09] <DXLelouch24> Woolie your barks are limp
[2:19:09] <%wolfofsound> FrankerZ
[2:19:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> DMX always made me feel like each bark he did was a murder
[2:19:52] <castcola> DMX had the bark blast technique
[2:19:56] <+InstiGaitan> high monk > mortal blade
[2:20:01] <%Solidnick18> aye
[2:20:02] <Tisaric> Ichimonji is just a little bit OP
[2:20:03] <atin2000> @WoolieVersus it does pretty good damage, but you dont get the posture recovery
[2:20:12] <%Solidnick18> very slow
[2:20:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Centipede fight!
[2:20:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> WHIFF
[2:20:23] <+InstiGaitan> high monk > everything else
[2:20:27] <worldbrand> I kinda wish the blade were more consequential
[2:20:28] <Spagheddies> @WoolieVersus Keep the double ichimonji. The Mortal Draw deals good damage, but no posture recovery, whereas the 2Ichi deals good damage and posture recovery.
[2:20:29] <Graxe_> Monks wanna keep her to themselves.
[2:20:33] <Spagheddies> And it costs less.
[2:20:37] <Kghaleon> Pretty sure she's the one that talks to you when you first visit this zone
[2:20:37] <Graxe_> Lock her away
[2:20:47] <%Solidnick18> Oh
[2:20:58] <+Pookiedaexzile> 720
[2:21:07] <0rond> again with the jumping woolie plz
[2:21:13] <0rond> jump attacks do no damage
[2:21:16] <NeroInfinite> Mortis sweep
[2:21:17] <+Caped_Eggy> I do believe that the mortal draw damage through blocking, but not much
[2:21:17] <%Solidnick18> yee
[2:21:21] <+tiki_vx> wassup woolie
[2:21:37] <worldbrand> like if the mortal blade instead used a resurrection node every time it was drawn, that'd be pretty interesting
[2:21:46] <Dragon_Batman> That was a combo and a half, ouch
[2:21:56] <0rond> it would but it would have to be way stronger
[2:21:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie gives up LUL
[2:22:17] <+Skelemungus> they dont die though
[2:22:17] <%Lion_kun> MONKEY ISLAND
[2:22:20] <%Lion_kun> MORE MONKEYS
[2:22:24] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus go talk to your trainer at your base
[2:22:31] <%wolfofsound> LUBU
[2:22:37] <Spagheddies> Lu-bu
[2:22:38] <NeroInfinite> lubebu
[2:22:38] <castcola> Do Not Pursue
[2:22:41] <Spagheddies> Don't chase him
[2:22:42] <%Solidnick18> lube bu
[2:22:46] <Dragon_Batman> Do not pursue him
[2:22:51] <gigacanuck> wooloo is wululu
[2:22:51] <%Solidnick18> ;p
[2:22:56] <%DedlokPM> Yubu, Mebu, Webu, Lubu, Subu
[2:22:57] <%wolfofsound> actually in the new total war game you totally want to get him
[2:23:06] <DomunDomunDomun> we all bu for ice bu
[2:23:24] <laserbeaming> UwU
[2:23:24] <Make_me_mad> Fun Lu Bu facts: In real life he died like a punk.
[2:23:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> STRAAAAAY!
[2:23:28] <%wolfofsound> FUCK YEAH
[2:23:33] <+InstiGaitan> ookami AYAYA
[2:23:37] <%wolfofsound> Love that anime
[2:23:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Speaking of Okami, that brush stroke
[2:23:45] <+rdark_ksu> wolfs rain was fucking crazy cause it was all out of order when I saw it
[2:23:47] <+griffball13> that is a weird anime
[2:23:52] <$Rezca> Not enough guys in tight pants
[2:24:34] <%jinking79> you'll use it on One boss fight
[2:24:35] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's for big boy damage on bosses/mini-bosses
[2:24:38] <Dragon_Batman> I mean he is spending six
[2:24:40] <%wolfofsound> That scene when Toboe loses it on the giant walrus man
[2:24:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie VS The Locals
[2:24:56] <+Skelemungus> i believe that move does go through blocks though
[2:25:01] <0rond> yup, as with all combat arts, "that's pretty cool, but ichimongi is better and free"
[2:25:06] <0rond> that's such a shame tbh
[2:25:06] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:25:31] <%Solidnick18> i think they respawn
[2:25:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:25:43] <%Solidnick18> BASKET
[2:25:44] <Graxe_> Oh this guy

[2:26:12] <%Promessa_EX> wooliePOYO
[2:26:13] <Ion_Laser> Kappa
[2:26:16] <alexandrecau> you're a shinobi wolf
[2:26:23] <Graxe_> I can see this guy becoming a Stand user with a shitty Stand
[2:26:42] <Dragon_Batman> Some dood who didn't kill him immediately is my guess
[2:26:48] <%wolfofsound> @Graxe_ He'd be super powerful in One Piece with the basket basket fruit
[2:26:51] <alexandrecau> Are you not gonna kill me= honorable
[2:26:55] <zamzoph> I'm normal! It's everyone ELSE who's crazy!
[2:27:03] <%Promessa_EX> sounds like water

[2:27:40] <Graxe_> Drink the water
[2:27:44] <+Skelemungus> yep
[2:27:45] <+griffball13> they drank the koolaid
[2:27:56] <Graxe_> It's very special water
[2:27:59] <+linSP> WOOLAID
[2:28:03] <$Rezca> Do not drink water from places with bad public utlities
[2:28:14] <+hypemaster19> the water's fine
[2:28:34] <gigacanuck> but check out that Inuhiko guy, he sounds cool
[2:28:45] <NeroInfinite> Or don't drink water form places with giant chickens
[2:28:59] <gigacanuck> but I want to be giant like giant chickens
[2:29:46] <Graxe_> The fun thing about the puppeteer ninjutsu is that you can reapply it if you have the emblems to do it again.
[2:29:50] <castcola> They were all just waiting dang
[2:30:02] <Djinnazz> Got your bell rung.
[2:30:05] <gigacanuck> so about that fire arm

[2:36:00] <NeoRageX456> yeah, what he said Kappa
[2:36:07] <gigacanuck> no stamina damage to this guy
[2:36:08] <+zanzibar_junker> Hide Presence would give a free kill
[2:36:23] <+EndgameContent> So even if you have 3 dots, you can only use one of 'em against this guy.

[2:49:40] <+Serial_Gurter> Is that the mythical soup collecting hoodie?
[2:49:53] <+pkmamsters> Nao-chan best female member. She WILL speak her mind.
[2:49:54] <meermadon> Oh I always thought that was just Matt being stupid
[2:50:01] <turf_wind_and_fire> @meermadon ditto
[2:50:08] <+rdark_ksu> Terrace House would be funny if they just put them in some state. LIke Illinois or Arkansas and they just confused
[2:50:11] <BabyNaBackbrace> I call it Soup Hoodie because it looks like soup, I wanna throw croutons at it
[2:50:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> your death is what it is
[2:50:17] <Dragon_Batman> I didn't realize that until they talked about it on the podcast back when the 3 were doing it
[2:50:26] <brambobelurkin> Oh hes here

[2:50:54] <+pkmamsters> Arman's the best
[2:51:01] <worldbrand> they're pushing the biracials
[2:51:01] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus I saw Heart Signal from the Twitch K-Drama marathon, which was quite amusing. The doctor was alpha that all the girls wanted, which made it tough for the stage actor and the race car driver
[2:51:10] <%robobeau> Goddamn, those half Japanese girls... do it to me every time...
[2:51:16] <+cvp5127> so exotic PogChamp

[2:51:44] <+griffball13> so the fe says
[2:51:46] <zamzoph> the bi part is very important. Can't be _too_ foreign
[2:51:59] <%robobeau> Real talk, what's contact medicine for...?
[2:52:01] <Dragon_Batman> Hah
[2:52:09] <+pkmamsters> Wait till you get to Aloha State and meet Wes.
[2:52:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> can you explain the dishes weren't done arc
[2:52:18] <Graxe_> If you combine contact medicine with mist raven, you can basically teleport constantly until the poison goes away.
[2:52:23] <zamzoph> MONEY
[2:52:31] <cheffailure> @robobeau For forgetting about poison damage, and teleporting with the Mist Raven at will.
[2:52:31] <+ucbigdrifter210ap> MOTIVATED
[2:52:39] <%Solidnick18> yes
[2:52:41] <Graxe_> Contact medicine inflicts you with a really weak poison.
[2:52:42] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus what reality tv show pick uggos?

[3:04:45] <Kalinflip> hoes mad
[3:04:46] <Dragon_Batman> This is super majorly doable without the confetti
[3:04:46] <chronoxgp> i said nothing and she still gets mad
[3:04:52] <%Solidnick18> Hoe is indeed mad
[3:04:52] <rad_dude123465> Hoes mad
[3:04:53] <duraju> does woolie not know about jumping on their heads when they sweep?
[3:04:58] <gslayer14> hoes furious
[3:05:04] <Kalinflip> hoes irate
[3:05:07] <zamzoph> F
[3:05:09] <BlkFlameKami> F
[3:05:14] <+InstiGaitan> final death
[3:05:15] <NeoRageX456> he calls it but never moves LUL
[3:05:16] <NocturnalRites> To quote Pat Hoes mad
[3:05:17] <RyuuAoi> HOE
[3:05:19] <rad_dude123465> Hoes displeased
[3:05:25] <antthefool> THAT DAMAGE
[3:05:29] <Dragon_Batman> I think he does know he just jumps too much backwards to get away
[3:05:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> never fight against a basket headed hoe
[3:05:32] <Raldavar> so when is Woolie gonna finish round 3 of Naruto shitpuden?
[3:05:33] <duraju> ! HOE AT RISK !
[3:05:35] <gslayer14> prostitutes inconsolable
[3:05:37] <atin2000> Boy she it seems almost like she's some kinda ghost
[3:05:39] <brambobelurkin> Orinn was the hardest Mini-boss in the game for me
[3:05:50] <%Solidnick18> i love that pattern
[3:05:57] <NeoRageX456> he also doesn't guard to recover posture
[3:05:57] <BlkFlameKami> FF
[3:05:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[3:05:59] <%robobeau> It's possible to sneak in a hit on this boss
[3:06:01] <Kalinflip> she is apparition
[3:06:08] <GoldeNOVA> Suckas never learn
[3:06:09] <BabyNaBackbrace> O-Rin was a fun couple days of learning.
[3:06:10] <%Promessa_EX> use your jump kick, X-X
[3:06:11] <%robobeau> but the timing is really tricky
[3:06:13] <%Solidnick18> O rin is so cool
[3:06:14] <FALCONxPAWNCH> You can walk past her for different dialogue
[3:06:15] <NocturnalRites> I can do Orinn fine its those damn Snake Eyes that get me
[3:06:17] <brambobelurkin> I used Mortal on her
[3:06:22] <castcola> @brambobelurkin yeah she's really a curve ball if you've played super aggressive throughout and then run into her.
[3:06:23] <alexandrecau> her name is maria
[3:06:24] <Kalinflip> I know WHat your talking about MinT
[3:06:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> talk to guy
[3:06:31] <Kalinflip> SHe was op
[3:06:38] <Dragon_Batman> Yea those snake eyes are like the hardest for me too
[3:06:40] <worldbrand> Jin also plays a shamisen briefly
[3:06:42] <+EndgameContent> The musical assassins.
[3:06:44] <+RebelzPlague> I thought they patched the jump sneak attack?
[3:06:47] <%Solidnick18> attack her
[3:06:50] <+griffball13> do you need divine confettie to hurt her well?
[3:06:54] <fallacy8> free hit
[3:06:55] <brambobelurkin> @castcode thats exactly how I was playing too. I ended up lusing spacing and mortal to punish
[3:07:05] <cheffailure> Divine confetti does bonus damage
[3:07:09] <Kalinflip> ^
[3:07:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay
[3:07:10] <GoldeNOVA> SWING FIRST
[3:07:15] <zamzoph> Kung Fu Hustle PogChamp
[3:07:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> lie to da hoe again
[3:07:21] <rad_dude123465> @woolieversus don’t forget about head stomping on sweeps
[3:07:23] <%Solidnick18> just fucking start swinging
[3:07:33] <zamzoph> NO HONOR
[3:07:35] <SixthSun2> WOW, no dignity
[3:07:36] <natebud> How rude
[3:07:38] <+MagicBeanBurrito> [CRYING]4
[3:07:42] <brambobelurkin> I found Snake eyes to be different but not hard. you can get the stealth hit on them
[3:07:45] <+EndgameContent> Maybe Woolie Should Try Exploring Past This Area Without Fighting Her
[3:07:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> LOL, hoes don't be crying in woolie's neighborhood
[3:07:58] <+cvp5127> yoooo shinkenger
[3:07:59] <+OctopusLantern> yo shinkenger is great
[3:08:00] <cheffailure> Goomba stomp, boyo.
[3:08:10] <rad_dude123465> Those episodes of samurai champloo were the shit
[3:08:12] <+AngriestAngryArtist> ABARE :P
[3:08:18] <zamzoph> it's like this is an archetype or something
[3:08:19] <chronoxgp> i feel like that's a trope
[3:08:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[3:08:20] <+InstiGaitan> stio jumping back bruh
[3:08:24] <+griffball13> her life bar is right there
[3:08:25] <+MagicBeanBurrito> what
[3:08:26] <gslayer14> ?
[3:08:26] <worldbrand> ????
[3:08:26] <$Rezca> fire in the sky?
[3:08:29] <natebud> Yep, no life bar nowhere
[3:08:30] <Kalinflip> The senpou skill tree has my favorite sweep counter in the game
[3:08:30] <%Solidnick18> yes
[3:08:30] <fallacy8> what
[3:08:32] <NeoRageX456> woolie has crazy talk as well?
[3:08:37] <+Dorf1> what did he mean by this
[3:08:41] <Raldavar> everyone knows Woolie is blind.
[3:08:45] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:08:45] <Dragon_Batman> True the snake eyes get a free stealth if you get it but I found their moves more tough to figure out, until I got the umbrella at least
[3:08:48] <+InstiGaitan> wheres the lifebar
[3:08:49] <castcola> @brambobelurkin ya this was the fight where the game for me was 'learn to parry' and I just had to stop being mad and pay attention to the tells
[3:08:52] <+Tearonex> "Has no lifebar"
[3:09:08] <fallacy8> oh its a death bar
[3:09:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:09:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Yandere Ghost Waifu's <3
[3:09:12] <zamzoph> LUL
[3:09:12] <+InstiGaitan> thats not her lifebar thats youre lifebar
[3:09:15] <chronoxgp> isn't that what happens in lady butterfly, the absent father comes home with a new wife so she has a break down
[3:09:15] <natebud> Leave a bootprint on that ghost's face
[3:09:22] <fallacy8> cause its a ghost
[3:09:26] <NocturnalRites> She might as well have no life bar its way easier to posture break her in my opinion
[3:09:28] <%Solidnick18> that's a one shot
[3:09:34] <+Codex5050> TO ALL: crazy talk is NOT the same as being wrong! Crazy Talk is Pat's stand where he says something SUPER wrong, and it becomes TRUE later!
[3:09:52] <+cvp5127> billy whats your favorite sentai?
[3:09:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Leave a hand print on that ghosts ass.
[3:09:54] <worldbrand> you beat me to the punch, but yeah
[3:09:58] <+EndgameContent> Isn't that Crazy Talk Requiem?
[3:10:00] <+Codex5050> deep lore for you
[3:10:04] <%Solidnick18> posture break her
[3:10:23] <+TopTieramisu> this fight is so cool
[3:10:26] <brambobelurkin> @castcode First Boss I really parried to death was the Giraffe boys. Then Lil Yao followed by the Big Yao
[3:10:28] <BabyNaBackbrace> Codex is being crazy talked
[3:10:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah, crazy talk requiem is a stand that infects others and when they say something super wrong about something trivial it becomes true
[3:10:56] <+EndgameContent> Thought Crazy Talk was Pat saying something and reality bending out of the way to spite him
[3:11:16] <worldbrand> crazy talk is pat saying something and then reality bending to make him wrong, requiem is when he says something absurd that becomes true like GRRM mentioning locking him in a cabin
[3:11:20] <BabyNaBackbrace> Crazy Talk Requiem, aka UNSANE
[3:11:28] <Raldavar> crazy talk's normal ability is to alter space-time to randomly make what Pat says wrong with no discernible pattern
[3:11:40] <%Solidnick18> christ
[3:11:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @worldbrand that man is 100% correct, that is crazy talk requiem
[3:11:46] <+EndgameContent> Yeah, that makes a bit more sense
[3:12:01] <+griffball13> magic pixel
[3:12:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> Get aggresive
[3:12:10] <duraju> F
[3:12:13] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:12:14] <%Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[3:12:15] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:12:16] <chronoxgp> woolie thinking too much
[3:12:20] <+Codex5050> as long as the misinformation is stemmed I am here for it! thank for you for the corrections!
[3:12:23] <castcola> @brambobelurkin I wish I really ran into those two sooner because O'Rin just phasing around was throwing me off as well.
[3:12:28] <+TopTieramisu> hesitation is defeat
[3:12:37] <NocturnalRites> yeah it looked like he panickedf a bit
[3:12:39] <%robobeau> Yeah you really gotta go in on this boss
[3:12:40] <+InstiGaitan> was about to say that @TopTieramisu
[3:12:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> BE, AGGRESSIVE, B, E, AGGRESSIVE
[3:12:46] <%robobeau> Confetti helps
[3:12:48] <chronoxgp> i see woolie trying to learn a 3rd strike, when no boss in this game lets you do that
[3:12:52] <%Solidnick18> YES
[3:12:53] <zamzoph> all that for one bar LUL
[3:13:06] <castcola> here we go
[3:13:10] <%Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[3:13:10] <duraju> all that for a drop of bar
[3:13:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> confetti is useful if u have any
[3:13:18] <brambobelurkin> @castcode I didnt realize it at first, but I started at Senpou and went backwards I guess lol. Most people I saw hit this way and Monkey trouble first.
[3:13:21] <NocturnalRites> Her speed makes being too agressive a bad idea
[3:13:29] <fallacy8> crackers
[3:13:29] <Patzzki217> use sabimaru if you want cheese
[3:13:38] <fallacy8> n spirit juice
[3:13:41] <+InstiGaitan> honestly sugar is more useful
[3:13:46] <cheffailure> Walk away.
[3:13:54] <OkamiDude15> i cheesed her on the geometry but even that is pretty hard
[3:13:55] <%Aussie_Manny> NOTICE ME, SENPAI!
[3:14:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Hoes Mad x24
[3:14:02] <+InstiGaitan> WHAT
[3:14:02] <+TopTieramisu> top yandere
[3:14:02] <%robobeau> IT'S NOT LIKE I WANTED YOU TO NOTICE ME B-BAKA
[3:14:03] <BabyNaBackbrace> That scared the shit out of me the first time
[3:14:09] <chronoxgp> gasai yuno
[3:14:18] <worldbrand> You can technically just run away
[3:14:19] <+InstiGaitan> THAT NEVER HAPPENED TO ME
[3:14:28] <Raldavar> daily reminder that Sekiro has no stamina bar, meaning you can keep swinging and run like a scrub forever
[3:14:36] <brambobelurkin> ^
[3:14:37] <DXLelouch24> but if you run away all of chat will call you a Coward
[3:14:42] <NocturnalRites> I mean you can sneak around by swimming near the bridge and grappling up
[3:14:53] <chronoxgp> even if you do get staggered you can just roll
[3:14:58] <cheffailure> Woolie, she's actually a health boss pretending to be a posture boss.
[3:15:07] <worldbrand> yeah but ghosts are scarier than human judgement so i wouldnt mind being a coward in that situation
[3:15:17] <+TopTieramisu> @cheffailure i disagree
[3:15:25] <natebud> I remember being able to get one free swipe in when she does the jump
[3:15:28] <+TopTieramisu> you have to land the consecutive deflections
[3:15:29] <NocturnalRites> Blocking when you get staggered is the safer option
[3:15:37] <worldbrand> on my first playthrough she was a health boss, on my second playthrough she was a posture boss
[3:15:38] <OkamiDude15> all that smack talk about ghosts are catching up to woolie
[3:15:50] <cheffailure> The problem is her posture regen is too fast at this NG.
[3:15:56] <duraju> gHosTs aRe JusT cHEMICals
[3:16:08] <zamzoph> She'll chase you to the ends of the earth!
[3:16:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:16:10] <+cvp5127> yandere Kreygasm
[3:16:18] <gslayer14> yanyan?
[3:16:25] <gslayer14> is that how that works
[3:16:41] <OkamiDude15> everyones gangsta till she actually straight up murders you
[3:16:43] <NocturnalRites> If you have deflect timing down her posture regen isnt a problem
[3:16:51] <+InstiGaitan> You uaed to be able to backstab her by jumping on her from behind but idk if that works anymore
[3:16:54] <Bakafied> I really like her moveset and title, they go really well together.
[3:17:06] <cheffailure> Not anymore. They realized the cheese.
[3:17:07] <GoldeNOVA> Is there no arm that is good against her?
[3:17:10] <worldbrand> i know it's an incredibly bad habit, but i found jumping to be really effective against her
[3:17:20] <cheffailure> She's an okami relative. Probably.
[3:17:27] <+mobius_won> I had to cheese this bitch in my first playthrough
[3:17:29] <agentsap2006> I like how in Sekiro everyone just has a katana to pull on each other
[3:17:37] <benjiFG> yanyan
[3:17:39] <Raldavar> did they ever nerf fireworks?
[3:17:45] <cheffailure> Probably not.
[3:17:49] <GoldeNOVA> The problem is that Woolie jumps back, so he gets out of range
[3:17:59] <NocturnalRites> This game is a lot like DS1 if you can parry you are golden
[3:18:06] <worldbrand> yeah now that you mention it, it's really interesting how she's lit from below
[3:18:10] <lemonfroot> oh shiiiiiiiit Woolie's playing Sekiro? I just finished re-watching their DS1 LP
[3:18:20] <zamzoph> just like genichiro
[3:18:26] <worldbrand> y... yeah... just like real life
[3:18:42] <GoldeNOVA> You're fighting a dude and he pulls out a Pepsi
[3:18:44] <NocturnalRites> Genichiro is a bitch if oyu have deflect and jump timing down
[3:18:48] <HawaiiAnthony> just like in vietnam
[3:18:48] <BionicPulga> I cheese this fight so hard.
[3:18:50] <OkamiDude15> mihn's secret underground tournament fights
[3:18:53] <Tisaric> she almostr looks like a luigi's mansion ghost with the way she'ls lit
[3:18:53] <+InstiGaitan> you'vee never healed yourself in battle in real life?
[3:18:56] <cheffailure> Neutral jump, baby.
[3:19:03] <lemonfroot> Sekiro but there's summons
[3:19:16] <+zanzibar_junker> I honesty use axe more than ichimonji
[3:19:18] <NocturnalRites> Woolies got bad nooch
[3:19:24] <NeoRageX456> woolie just let that left stick alone and parry/jump kick
[3:19:24] <worldbrand> imagine being brave enough to ichimonji a ghost
[3:19:30] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:19:30] <duraju> i think woolie is tired
[3:19:34] <rad_dude123465> Gotta step up that NOOCH
[3:19:44] <+griffball13> divine confettie does bonus damage right?
[3:19:48] <worldbrand> yep
[3:19:50] <cheffailure> She's a keeper. As in she's gonna keep you occupied.
[3:19:50] <KillMyPast> Theres some good cheese strats against her
[3:19:53] <+TopTieramisu> i'd say it's more his defense and punish game that are not up to snuff
[3:20:04] <Dragon_Batman> He just isn't getting the parries, now he is though
[3:20:05] <+zanzibar_junker> Save da confetti
[3:20:08] <NocturnalRites> well that and his inability to neutral jump
[3:20:15] <OkamiDude15> never stop going in
[3:20:17] <+InstiGaitan> sugars more helpful cause deflects
[3:20:18] <%Promessa_EX> I would guess she goes down like everything else if you rush aggressively
[3:20:18] <natebud> You get do one free hit on that jump.
[3:20:21] <cheffailure> Absolute disrespect.
[3:20:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Is wooolie going for for a kill everything run?
[3:20:27] <gslayer14> wake up supers
[3:20:38] <BabyNaBackbrace> When I finally learned her "reads" I took her out almost without realizing I beat her
[3:20:48] <+zanzibar_junker> Jump on her
[3:20:55] <worldbrand> let's just nonstop dragon rush and hope nothing goes wrong
[3:21:01] <gslayer14> sabby bois
[3:21:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Minh's attempts at niche humor
[3:21:06] <lemonfroot> O'rin was brutal for me too but it may be because I'm trash lol
[3:21:13] <zamzoph> poisoning a ghost LUL
[3:21:21] <GoldeNOVA> You see Bison charge his Psycho Crusher and doesn't do anything
[3:21:26] <+TopTieramisu> can you poison a ghost? 🤔
[3:21:29] <cheffailure> Congrats Woolie, you found it.
[3:21:29] <Patzzki217> sabimaru is good
[3:21:31] <gslayer14> PISS OFF GHOST
[3:21:34] <OkamiDude15> guess so
[3:21:35] <duraju> i used the chemicals to destroy the chemicals
[3:21:43] <+griffball13> bitch ass ghosts
[3:21:58] <cheffailure> Expensive though.
[3:21:59] <+TopTieramisu> let's goooo
[3:22:01] <gslayer14> its s shame poison doesnt last on her
[3:22:01] <worldbrand> holy shit he did it
[3:22:09] <duraju> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[3:22:11] <lemonfroot> poison affects ghosts because poison is just emotional draining
[3:22:16] <ashuckel> sekiro rewards you towards being super aggressive and just defending at the right times
[3:22:17] <+TopTieramisu> oh damn, now he has to play honestly
[3:22:18] <cheffailure> Tanto, unfortunately.
[3:22:18] <OkamiDude15> friendship ended with fireworks now sabimaru is woolie's new best friend
[3:22:19] <BabyNaBackbrace> Sabimaru's my JAM
[3:22:21] <natebud> Now do it legit
[3:22:24] <+griffball13> no
[3:22:25] <Ragnorok64> I had no idea that worked??!
[3:22:29] <GoldeNOVA> Do those rekkas
[3:22:31] <cheffailure> Ceremonial Tanto
[3:22:31] <worldbrand> ceremonial tanto
[3:22:34] <zamzoph> CONFETTI
[3:22:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Is sabimaru that wakizashi?
[3:22:38] <+TopTieramisu> he's all out of meter
[3:22:40] <Patzzki217> the knife
[3:22:50] <+griffball13> confettie will help
[3:22:51] <worldbrand> i never found it worth it
[3:22:54] <NocturnalRites> You gotta fight a Shichimen to get it and those guys are assholes
[3:22:56] <cheffailure> Bonus damage
[3:22:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> Use some sugar
[3:22:58] <+TopTieramisu> she a ghost
[3:23:00] <+zanzibar_junker> Nnnnnnooooo
[3:23:00] <Djinnazz> she's dead.
[3:23:01] <+InstiGaitan> AKOS SUGAR
[3:23:02] <worldbrand> It's divine confetti, man
[3:23:05] <duraju> dont use the confetti
[3:23:05] <+InstiGaitan> NOT CONFETTI
[3:23:05] <zamzoph> Woolie forgot BrokeBack
[3:23:06] <cheffailure> Better to use sugar though.
[3:23:07] <BionicPulga> Maybe you should save the Sabimaru for the second phase.
[3:23:08] <+zanzibar_junker> Nnnnooo
[3:23:09] <BabyNaBackbrace> ooooOOoohh
[3:23:10] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:23:10] <duraju> NOOOOO
[3:23:11] <+InstiGaitan> AKOS SUGAR
[3:23:14] <+InstiGaitan> NOOOOOO
[3:23:16] <NocturnalRites> Posture sugar is more helpful
[3:23:23] <Dragon_Batman> You don't really need to
[3:23:25] <chronoxgp> she's not that hard jeez
[3:23:30] <worldbrand> Don't use all of it, but
[3:23:31] <NeoRageX456> he has 16 in store may as well use a couple for shits and gigs
[3:23:35] <OkamiDude15> she aint gonna let tou get the chance
[3:23:38] <natebud> I didn't waste confetti here.
[3:23:39] <lemonfroot> oof
[3:23:40] <duraju> F
[3:23:42] <gslayer14> now perish
[3:23:51] <Dragon_Batman> Fair enough
[3:23:59] <+JingKaisean> use poison
[3:24:01] <lemonfroot> i think she's tough send tweet
[3:24:09] <BionicPulga> Haha.
[3:24:09] <+JingKaisean> works better than confetti
[3:24:14] <+InstiGaitan> who said use confetti
[3:24:17] <+Sabre_Basilisk> But do combo tho
[3:24:21] <BabyNaBackbrace> I want Sekiro in Soul Calibur
[3:24:21] <NocturnalRites> that back jumping is not helping him at all but hey hes getting the fight down
[3:24:27] <+TopTieramisu> F
[3:24:28] <zamzoph> F
[3:24:31] <worldbrand> he did use poison but he ran outta emblems
[3:24:32] <natebud> You get ONE free hit on that jump
[3:24:34] <duraju> dont use it tho
[3:24:39] <+InstiGaitan> USE AKOS SUGAR
[3:24:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay
[3:24:40] <Dapper_Cactuar> everyone I know hates this fight with a fiery passion
[3:24:41] <NeoRageX456> confetti does more damage in general
[3:24:41] <transporterthesequel> Wollie the second she stops attacking GO IN
[3:24:43] <chronoxgp> she doesn't do that many attacks between steps
[3:24:43] <duraju> use sugar

[3:24:53] <worldbrand> this fight gave me trouble, but i really like it
[3:24:56] <%Promessa_EX> use neutral jumps instead of jumping back
[3:24:58] <Graxe_> @WoolieVersus It is possible to get a deathblow her before the fight starts. Just jump on her head. Seriously.
[3:25:01] <+TopTieramisu> some people never figured out how this fight works
[3:25:03] <%robobeau> You can throw a rock at her before the fight to get in a backstab
[3:25:03] <lemonfroot> I need a koopy sandwich tbh
[3:25:07] <NocturnalRites> Posture would help more against her since she does so much damn posture damage
[3:25:11] <%robobeau> But the timing is TIGHT
[3:25:13] <+InstiGaitan> if you dont hit her there isnt a point in using confetti you deflect so use sugar
[3:25:13] <cheffailure> @Graxe_ Been patched out.
[3:25:16] <+JingKaisean> scum out the first deathblow
[3:25:21] <BionicPulga> I cheesed it too.
[3:25:28] <Graxe_> Oh, that's too bad.
[3:25:31] <BionicPulga> Screw the style points, lol.
[3:25:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Man Shin-Hisako got buffed
[3:25:36] <gslayer14> thats some nice posture damage
[3:25:38] <+SchmeatBoy> cheese ResidentSleeper
[3:25:41] <alexandrecau> poison the ghost
[3:25:42] <NeoRageX456> just parry, jump counter the sweeps and attack just enough to not let her recover posture
[3:25:46] <Graxe_> Sabimaru is her actual weakness, though. So nice that Woolie found that out.
[3:25:48] <+TopTieramisu> ouch
[3:25:51] <%cspilly> rockguitarfan subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[3:25:53] <zamzoph> just posture her out
[3:25:59] <+Sabre_Basilisk> woolie vs game mechanics
[3:26:04] <+TopTieramisu> wall pressure
[3:26:09] <rad_dude123465> Get doinked
[3:26:11] <Dragon_Batman> Ooof that corner pressur
[3:26:17] <duraju> just beat every enemy perfectly everytime
[3:26:19] <NocturnalRites> Like someone said earlier she is a health boss not a posture boss
[3:26:20] <natebud> I think the only time healing is safe is when she does that back jump.
[3:26:30] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:26:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wow Minh, savage
[3:26:35] <+InstiGaitan> she's totally not a health boss
[3:26:39] <cheffailure> Neutral jump baby
[3:26:40] <alexandrecau> finally woolie will be hokage
[3:26:44] <+InstiGaitan> she attacks too much to be a health boss
[3:26:51] <NeoRageX456> actually woolie, stand against a wall that way you can't jump backwards anymore LUL
[3:27:05] <+InstiGaitan> you deflect her flurry shes at like 40% posture
[3:27:21] <zamzoph> every time NotLikeThis
[3:27:23] <BionicPulga> @NeoRageX456 LUL
[3:27:24] <worldbrand> you can pretty easily bait her into using it, too
[3:27:30] <%Promessa_EX> one better, maybe jump forward
[3:27:37] <gslayer14> does woolie know that feathering parry reduces it's active frames?
[3:27:39] <yamikami13> well hello fellow citizen of the interweb. how are you all doing on this fine evening
[3:27:41] <worldbrand> yeaaaah
[3:27:45] <+Sabre_Basilisk> yeyeyeye
[3:27:47] <NocturnalRites> yeah which means its easier to go for posture getting her health pool to drop is more difficult
[3:27:50] <+TopTieramisu> i love that death blow
[3:27:59] <+TopTieramisu> that and the mikiri death blow
[3:28:00] <BabyNaBackbrace> Now it's time for the SABI STABBY
[3:28:22] <+Sabre_Basilisk> that was close
[3:28:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nice off the wall attack, Vega

[3:30:24] <+InstiGaitan> worst quest reward
[3:30:30] <NocturnalRites> eh I think Jizo statues arent completely useless
[3:30:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes tired
[3:30:35] <Brentd24> where y'all geeked that the Raptors won
[3:30:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes lived a hard life
[3:30:49] <natebud> You did also get prayer beads and healing deathblows at least.
[3:30:51] <BionicPulga> I used the Jizo statues in the last fight.
[3:30:51] <BabyNaBackbrace> Jizos help in a very specific situation
[3:30:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes earned his rest
[3:30:54] <cheffailure> Found your waifu.
[3:30:56] <%galaxyswirl> i want to believe that ghost was his mama
[3:30:58] <cheffailure> You got beads
[3:31:05] <+InstiGaitan> If you dont die and you rest they're useless
[3:31:11] <+SchmeatBoy> have a second jizo helped me through the last boss
[3:31:18] <NocturnalRites> but they are only really good for boss runs when you dont feel like farming out a res

[3:38:21] <+TopTieramisu> you never encounter the man o-rin was pining for
[3:38:32] <cheffailure> Sakuza never shows up in-game
[3:38:52] <natebud> I don't think he's even mentioned again
[3:38:53] <cheffailure> Welcome to the showdown.
[3:38:58] <BionicPulga> Aw yiss.
[3:39:03] <DXLelouch24> time to GITGUD Woolie

[3:39:13] <+zanzibar_junker> Run and gun
[3:39:17] <duraju> WOOLIE VS GHOSTS
[3:39:18] <+Sabre_Basilisk> Is sakuza not the statute guy then?
[3:39:19] <NocturnalRites> time for more deflecting
[3:39:20] <Dragon_Batman> It's that terror time again
[3:39:28] <+Sabre_Basilisk> bc now i feel a big confusion
[3:39:31] <+TopTieramisu> corrupted monk best waifu
[3:39:36] <Graxe_> Big posture, big health
[3:39:37] <%galaxyswirl> what does it look like?
[3:39:48] <+TopTieramisu> she thicc
[3:39:51] <+griffball13> now is the time to get good
[3:39:52] <+EndgameContent> I think it might be good for Woolie to know that she is not a ghost
[3:39:54] <Graxe_> But only gotta land that one deathblow, though
[3:39:56] <DXLelouch24> Woolie your not gonna poison a ghost cmon now
[3:40:00] <natebud> Jump right into the downward swing
[3:40:01] <+nekodelic> his posture is high, so you need to blaze a lot to get higher
[3:40:09] <+TopTieramisu> his?
[3:40:22] <DXLelouch24> corrupted monks a chikc dude
[3:40:26] <DXLelouch24> chick*
[3:40:43] <+EndgameContent> She's having nun of that
[3:40:44] <natebud> Lady does have a pretty deep voice
[3:40:44] <+TopTieramisu> now this is a health boss
[3:40:46] <%DashXero> DashXero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Finally catching one of these streams.
[3:40:57] <FALCONxPAWNCH> please do not misgender corrupted monk
[3:41:00] <duraju> does poison work here?
[3:41:03] <shadow1man9> No
[3:41:06] <cheffailure> Doubt it.
[3:41:08] <+zanzibar_junker> Nah
[3:41:09] <+TopTieramisu> she got autoguard
[3:41:10] <+EndgameContent> Woolie doesn't have a prayer in this first run
[3:41:12] <%galaxyswirl> not HERE
[3:41:13] <+TopTieramisu> like kyo kusanagi
[3:41:22] <+InstiGaitan> corrupted monks real name is priestess yao
[3:41:28] <Ragnorok64> is this even doable without confetti?
[3:41:33] <%galaxyswirl> yes
[3:41:35] <cheffailure> Monk means business!
[3:41:35] <Graxe_> O'Rin was a special case where she was actually weak to poison.
[3:41:36] <duraju> ye
[3:41:39] <shadow1man9> Yes
[3:41:40] <+TopTieramisu> @Ragnorok64 ye
[3:41:41] <gslayer14> until he figures out the gimmick he's got no chance
[3:41:41] <%galaxyswirl> every fight is
[3:41:42] <sjotyme86> she's a human end of story
[3:41:45] <NocturnalRites> just gotta git gud and deflect it all
[3:41:45] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it is super doable without confetti
[3:41:49] <+kaiser_077> Woolie is looking buff as hell
[3:41:51] <+TopTieramisu> confetti is never mandatory
[3:41:58] <BionicPulga> That was brave.
[3:42:03] <+Sabre_Basilisk> i hear ghots dont like fire or loud noises
[3:42:07] <+InstiGaitan> you can do this fight without in 1 hit
[3:42:22] <+InstiGaitan> you can do this fight in 1 hit*
[3:42:31] <shadow1man9> @InstiGaitan They removed that glitch I believe
[3:42:36] <+InstiGaitan> No way
[3:42:36] <%robobeau> I've done this fight without confetti, just footsies
[3:42:41] <+zanzibar_junker> Run and gun wait for big moves
[3:42:47] <+hypemaster19> confetti is good
[3:42:48] <%robobeau> Exactly, run and gun
[3:42:55] <NocturnalRites> Yup they removed the glitch to one shot the monk
[3:43:01] <chronoxgp> confetti is for corpses
[3:43:16] <+InstiGaitan> No way dude
[3:43:29] <Dragon_Batman> Yea figuring out her attacks is the major key.
[3:43:51] <NeoRageX456> confetti is for apparitions or whatever, this one is an illusion
[3:43:59] <+TopTieramisu> just fight her head on. it's a fun fight
[3:44:07] <%robobeau> *She
[3:44:12] <cheffailure> Firecrackers work on everyone.
[3:44:18] <+nekodelic> IT'S MA'AM
[3:44:23] <+Sabre_Basilisk> good combo interrupt right there
[3:44:24] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:44:24] <%fatal_penguin_> Ghosts>Chinese Propellant
[3:44:43] <zamzoph> cheese strats
[3:44:46] <+Sabre_Basilisk> Is this an enemy stand?
[3:44:49] <+EndgameContent> She's got the nun outfit and everything
[3:45:05] <%DashXero> I'm still not sure where greed factors into this game's combat.
[3:45:19] <cheffailure> That swing has some bizarre hitbox stuff going on. It might even require double-tapping if you're too close.
[3:45:22] <%robobeau> Dodge that jumping overhead and heavy attack
[3:45:22] <natebud> When she does those five big spins, the last one is slightly early just to throw you off.
[3:45:23] <+EndgameContent> It's not about greed, it's about aggression
[3:45:37] <+TopTieramisu> woolie's doing very well
[3:45:39] <+EndgameContent> It's applying constant pressure when it's prudent
[3:45:42] <NocturnalRites> I wonder if Woolie has any snap seeds
[3:46:14] <%robobeau> Oh hey, I wonder if you can jump over those rotating sweeps
[3:46:24] <Dragon_Batman> Ooooh yea snap seeds are a decent bit of help here
[3:46:47] <FALCONxPAWNCH> Ashes work too
[3:46:55] <%robobeau> Wut how are snap seeds good here...?
[3:46:59] <BionicPulga> Woolie's close.
[3:47:00] <NocturnalRites> shame that mikiri would have gotten close
[3:47:01] <cheffailure> I love baiting for that swing.
[3:47:12] <NeoRageX456> this is an illusion, snap seeds stun her
[3:47:16] <%robobeau> WHAT
[3:47:18] <Dragon_Batman> She technically is an illusion and snap seeds hurt her
[3:47:20] <%robobeau> I never knew
[3:47:22] <+RebelzPlague> yep
[3:47:23] <NeoRageX456> only 3 times
[3:47:26] <NocturnalRites> hey also do damage
[3:47:29] <+TopTieramisu> snap seeds do a buttload of damage
[3:47:30] <%robobeau> I mean, it makes sense given what comes later
[3:47:30] <+Sabre_Basilisk> iirc if you can beat this boss using items and its a cake walk
[3:47:37] <cheffailure> Will take her health down to almost health after three uses.
[3:47:41] <+TopTieramisu> let's gooooo

[3:47:49] <+Sabre_Basilisk> better than pat
[3:47:51] <Nyckelus> People cheese the crap out of this boss with snap seeds and firecrackers.
[3:47:51] <Graxe_> Look at that white ghost blood
[3:47:56] <%robobeau> Man, wish I knew about Snap Seeds
[3:47:57] <Dragon_Batman> Good stuff Woolz, missed that Mikir counter tho

[3:48:17] <DXLelouch24> nope

[3:48:37] <NeoRageX456> nah, he jumped backwards to victory
[3:48:38] <%robobeau> You can now encounter awful awful things underwater
[3:48:38] <Dragon_Batman> He doesn't have the whistle either
[3:48:41] <OkamiDude15> master your hamon breathing to fight kiryu
[3:48:48] <+MagiKestral> wait is this woolie's last kuro item

[3:49:24] <+InstiGaitan> lets hear it for 6
[3:49:24] <Tisaric> Big ATK go UP

[3:49:25] <duraju> wut

[3:49:26] <BionicPulga> 6 on 1 hand.
[3:49:26] <%fatal_penguin_> Wut
[3:49:26] <%robobeau> Has he fought Virgil yet?
[3:49:32] <DXLelouch24> DONT TRAVEL YET
[3:49:33] <duraju> 6 SETS OF HAND
[3:49:35] <+hypemaster19> 4Head 6 fingers confirmed
[3:49:35] <NeoRageX456> has he done everything in ashina castle already?
[3:49:36] <+MagiKestral> I prefer smaller damage values, they're more reap
[3:49:37] <DXLelouch24> STOP
[3:49:39] <+EndgameContent> I love small damage values, Darkest Dungeon is great
[3:49:44] <%fatal_penguin_> Do you secretly have 6 fingers woolie?
[3:49:46] <+MagiKestral> y'all if he warps he can come back later
[3:49:50] <+EndgameContent> It throws something like "21" at you and you go Oh Shit
[3:49:50] <OkamiDude15> which version of vergil @robobeau
[3:49:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Go ahead
[3:49:54] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> final fantasy best damage count
[3:49:56] <nmaten> the 6 fingered man? my name is ingo montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die
[3:49:56] <Ragnorok64> Tatsunoko with the billions]
[3:49:56] <cheffailure> 6 is amazing.
[3:50:01] <Graxe_> 6 ATK, 15 VIT
[3:50:03] <NocturnalRites> In before Woolie travels without noticing things
[3:50:04] <MasterCosmic> so small
[3:50:05] <Graxe_> Run that build
[3:50:06] <zamzoph> just multiply it by a gorillian and you'll feel better
[3:50:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> 6 times stronger than you started
[3:50:17] <@Menitta> oh no
[3:50:23] <%robobeau> @OkamiDude15 I was kidding, but I realize now that could ACTUALLY be interpreted as an ACTUAL boss lol
[3:50:24] <+hypemaster19> coping
[3:50:32] <DXLelouch24> 6 of i think 20 attack
[3:50:37] <DXLelouch24> or 10
[3:50:40] <cheffailure> Probably worse than waste of skin.
[3:50:43] <DXLelouch24> iforget
[3:50:44] <+hypemaster19> 20
[3:50:46] <+nekodelic> mind goblins
[3:50:48] <Raldavar> remember when you start an rpg doing 3 damage at level 1 and somehow start doing hundreds at level 5?
[3:50:50] <+Sabre_Basilisk> Whats the cap for attack through memories again?
[3:50:55] <+InstiGaitan> praying strikes is sick
[3:51:04] <OkamiDude15> what are woolie's mind goblins?
[3:51:10] <Revant_tillywink> very cool
[3:51:22] <duraju> woolie's mind goblins are just chemicals
[3:51:25] <cheffailure> Some big flinch tech up in this.
[3:51:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:51:26] <+InstiGaitan> you can do like sword into praying strikes
[3:51:28] <NocturnalRites> Senpo gets high monk which destroys sweep bosses
[3:51:29] <Dragon_Batman> Most enemies don't usually get to counter attack when you do that
[3:51:36] <+hypemaster19> !MOTIVATED
[3:51:36] <@Moobot> 406 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:51:41] <OkamiDude15> @duraju true
[3:51:42] <+InstiGaitan> They nerfed high monk too
[3:51:50] <%fatal_penguin_> Is it midnight in Montreal?
[3:51:50] <%robobeau> Minh doing the Lord's work
[3:51:50] <+InstiGaitan> high monk use to be B R O K E N
[3:51:51] <Dragon_Batman> Hah good stuff Minh
[3:52:05] <+MagiKestral> Vinny vinesauce ended there and it was the last kuro item, the blue balls were felt
[3:52:07] <NocturnalRites> Of course they did we cant have fun in a FromSoft game now can we
[3:52:10] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> shrek?
[3:52:13] <cheffailure> High monk was busted. Now it's respectable as a Mikiri.
[3:52:15] <OkamiDude15> @fatal_penguin_ i think its like 1 in the morning right now
[3:52:16] <Tisaric> sounds like Vinny
[3:52:20] <Raldavar> cue Kaine's theme
[3:52:30] <Graxe_> That's a giant kidney stone
[3:52:32] <Futurecity10> Thats one hell of a kidney stone
[3:52:44] <Dragon_Batman> Did they lessen the time in air or something for high monk?
[3:52:59] <cheffailure> No, just reduced posture damage dealt.
[3:53:04] <cheffailure> For the first hit.
[3:53:25] <NocturnalRites> thats not that bad
[3:53:27] <Dragon_Batman> oooh, on paper that doesn't sound so bad
[3:53:35] <cheffailure> So it does about the same as Mikiri on the first hit.
[3:53:47] <cheffailure> The rest of the combo is slightly buffed to encourage further use.
[3:53:47] <+zanzibar_junker> Good work woolie
[3:53:50] <+InstiGaitan> nah its not bad its just it used to be totally broken
[3:54:03] <Dragon_Batman> Nice that 's not bad as a buff and nerf
[3:54:04] <cheffailure> Good job Woolie.
[3:54:05] <natebud> And woolie has to remember to go swimming.
[3:54:14] <Dragon_Batman> I really like that skill regardless
[3:54:15] <+InstiGaitan> like destroy sweep bosses immediately broken
[3:54:21] <NocturnalRites> Ca't wait to see him fight the big boy
[3:54:32] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> woolie u look great
[3:54:35] <zamzoph> hah, that won't happen
[3:54:47] <cheffailure> Woolie is fighting against game design. That's a fun way to approach.
[3:55:00] <+nekodelic> well, good fucking luck, Woolie
[3:55:00] <Dragon_Batman> I loved the bonefist in Dark Souls one, fucking Shoryu
[3:55:13] <xiccy> punching sucks in the Souls games except the Bonefist gauntlets
[3:55:30] <natebud> A game made around the Royal Guard and Woolie wants less royal guard.

[3:56:58] <%Promessa_EX> vlogging from hotel room would be fine
[3:57:02] <@Menitta> yeah filming corpses....not a good idea
[3:57:14] <DianaTheAscian> didnt u scream in the woods woolie?
[3:57:16] <BabyNaBackbrace> I saw that video

[3:59:10] <%Hammerknife> oh shit woolie's on
[3:59:25] <%RC_S3kshun8> @WoolieVersus I don't think there is any audio, but the candid reactions are cool. I think the classy thing to do would be to afterward go to each table and ask for their permission or blur their faces out.
[3:59:32] <%DashXero> It would suck to be committing a crime or plotting a crime when that camera comes by.
[3:59:42] <worldbrand> sharp inhale through gritted teeth is the correct response
[3:59:47] <DianaTheAscian> wait nico nico isnt a meme?
[4:00:07] <@Menitta> @Nina96 Nico Nico is like Twitch for Japan iirc

[4:00:49] <OkamiDude15> it can do live streams tho which is where you see those videos where the text from chat scrolls across the screen
[4:00:53] <worldbrand> yeah don't get those confused
