[0:18:12] <jorniev> i dont think i liked a single character desing aside from berserker from the first set of trailers... but HOLY SHIT did they bring me back with the new character desings.
[0:18:14] <bv728> I'm looking forward to the next few characters they reveal, there's definitely more
[0:18:18] <+RustyCoyoteA> Feel that. Inquisitor and Dragon Knight have been what’s pulling at me
[0:18:20] <%leith_aziz> Need some "BLASTOFF!"
[0:18:21] <+Shishi1205> @JustToWatch I've been hit by that
[0:18:27] <+Shishi1205> It looks so strange
[0:18:33] <sherfman> What characters do you want as dlc the most woolie?
[0:18:43] <TheDo_DoGuy> grappler and crusader have been my go to character's
[0:18:44] <%jinking79> bullets filler for his sword
[0:18:46] <Guigondi> @slayabee it kinda felt like that in the previous match with crusaders infinite vs kunoichi tornado bullshit
[0:18:49] <+Shishi1205> @sherfman This is not the complete roster
[0:18:57] <jorniev> here is hoping they have an arthas looking dude if they do a necromancer
[0:19:04] <primaryfire> negan
[0:19:08] <Idon__> I already got Ghostblade I'm set LUL
[0:19:11] <@Menitta> The real trick is to set it to 2p stays on and people can find it easily since that's an uncommon rule set
[0:19:11] <jorniev> NEGAN LUL
[0:19:12] <huskarl_zap> Negan
[0:19:13] <zevenmillion> they just announced more characters today
[0:19:14] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Ghost blade has a trailer btw
[0:19:19] <bv728> Necromancer is a Dark Elf subclass
[0:19:22] <%Major_Lee_> Ranger sold me on apperance alone
[0:19:22] <+whoseblues> Troubleshooter is in the new trailer for a few seconds, I'm hype af
[0:19:22] <+Akizea> @jorniev the only necromancer is on dark elf
[0:19:23] <Zeif00> You'd like Monk
[0:19:24] <%jinking79> they announced Ghost Samurai today
[0:19:28] <TheDo_DoGuy> did woolie see ghost blade
[0:19:29] <zevenmillion> Ghostblade, Fmech Troubleshooter
[0:19:34] <%leith_aziz> Me neither. I did see Max rating the roster and that's about it
[0:19:37] <+Mrbaconator> the CHEESE WHEEL
[0:19:40] <jaysondeez> I want glacial master Male Mage
[0:19:41] <jorniev> IS there a wizard?

[0:19:47] <+DeadBulky> trailers sick
[0:19:48] <Qsmash_> Ghostblade looks so sick
[0:19:48] <randomdude365> The wheeel
[0:19:49] <Afrosamasenpai> oh no spin time
[0:19:49] <Samex_Comex> It's time for church
[0:19:50] <%JustToWatch> surely there is room for at least 1 Goku
[0:19:51] <%ken_kuma> I think Inquisitor is my girl
[0:19:56] <jaysondeez> female mechanic is a good choice. she has a nice look
[0:19:57] <+Shishi1205> THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING
[0:19:59] <Frampis> I love Crusader
[0:20:01] <huskarl_zap> Western schism
[0:20:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:20:01] <Afrosamasenpai> HAMMER VS WHEEL
[0:20:01] <Idon__> Catholic vs Protestant reformation 2021:
[0:20:04] <+SilverDevilfish> Protestant vs Catholic Kappa
[0:20:04] <jaysondeez> inquisitor in lore is legit insane
[0:20:08] <leomuratore> Fighting over the holy book
[0:20:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> do we crusade or inquisite
[0:20:09] <+Shishi1205> (why is it burning)
[0:20:11] <%Juriasu> I'd like to be inquisited by her
[0:20:12] <jaysondeez> god tells her to stop
[0:20:13] <+RyTYoung> Okay so Crusader is extremely nutty
[0:20:14] <bv728> Yeah, we have Ghostblade, F. Mech, and Troubleshooter in the new trailer, so folks are kind of expecting maybe an F.Mage, F.Slayer, and M.Mage
[0:20:17] <%leith_aziz> How to make your lord proud? Kill in his name! pickyDerp
[0:20:18] <Frampis> Is Woolie playing Crusader or Inquisitor?
[0:20:23] <Idon__> Crus
[0:20:24] <jaysondeez> she thnks what he means is NO I MUST PUNISH HERETICS HARDER
[0:20:26] <KaironFortressKnight> Buff Jesus and GrabRyu are both very fun
[0:20:26] <leomuratore> @Frampis Crusader
[0:20:28] <TheDo_DoGuy> the hand of God vs the wheel of fate
[0:20:28] <primaryfire> wheel vs wall
[0:20:28] <OkamiDude15> Crusader
[0:20:28] <+Shishi1205> jump MS is sooooo good
[0:20:30] <+DeadBulky> Bonk
[0:20:33] <Frampis> Crusader is my guy
[0:20:33] <yayohawk> ifrostD
[0:20:35] <+Akizea> I wa na k ow what f.slayer class we're gonna get first
[0:20:36] <GUDDAY12> NOOOO THE AEGIS REFLECTOR

[0:21:02] <+BackwardCap> gildedNut

[0:21:15] <+Nobuwaroo> oof
[0:21:22] <%Irridium> if I can find it LUL
[0:21:24] <Guigondi> i feel bad for the inquisitor
[0:21:25] <Saltmeisterr> oh hey more dnf
[0:21:28] <zevenmillion> are you on ps5 or ps4?
[0:21:31] <+furtive0ne> This game looks dope... no clue if im gonna play it lol
[0:21:33] <%Major_Lee_> Protestant vs Catholic fight
[0:21:38] <%DashXero> No one expects the inquisition.
[0:21:39] <Hirumm> she's in
[0:21:40] <+Shishi1205> It feels weird that crusader doesnt have a command grab
[0:21:46] <sherfman> Chat, has woolie played the new kof beta yet?
[0:21:47] <jorniev> what are the coolest character desings that they could add next chat? just so i can check them.
[0:21:50] <+Shishi1205> but inquisitor has
[0:21:55] <wisconsinjoe> Bible Study lets gooo
[0:21:57] <leomuratore> That damage!!!!
[0:22:04] <Midboss87> spiked to 5
[0:22:05] <jaysondeez> F Launcer looks cool if you want to look ath up jorniev
[0:22:09] <+slayabee> we call this MU Bible Study
[0:22:10] <+Shishi1205> @jorniev DNF has a whole website
[0:22:20] <wisconsinjoe> Jesus Christ indeed
[0:22:23] <+cgkonnor> I'm still waiting for her to use the wheel
[0:22:24] <jaysondeez> Female Mage Witch or Battle Mage both look cool
[0:22:27] <%leith_aziz> @jorniev There's Max's rate the roster if you want a quick look
[0:22:28] <Frampis> wow they made a website? unheard of
[0:22:30] <%jinking79> the good book say Jesus was in fact a Snitch
[0:22:33] <bv728> I kind of expect Demon Slayer
[0:22:33] <+orochiblood> @sherfman no and i dont think he is
[0:22:36] <Midboss87> I like the fade away hammer smash
[0:22:37] <jaysondeez> Glacial Master for Male mage
[0:22:41] <+RustyCoyoteA> Her 6S is so nice and can cross up
[0:22:46] <+Ellila> This is a weird peeve. But I kinda wish Crusader would constantly hold his hammer instead of having it on his back when not pressing buttons.
[0:22:52] <%leith_aziz> pickyPray pickyPray pickyPray
[0:22:52] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Try using jump B. I feel like its good and unexpected
[0:22:58] <%leith_aziz> pickyO7
[0:22:59] <KaironFortressKnight> I love how its just Indignation from Tales
[0:22:59] <jorniev> OK lady with a railgun looks sick
[0:23:00] <+Orbit_Boy> smote
[0:23:01] <Frampis> Crusader loves Jesus
[0:23:04] <sherfman> @orochiblood thats fine, i was just curious what he thought
[0:23:09] <jorniev> LIKE DAMN
[0:23:18] <Saltmeisterr> AND IN HIS NAME, SHAKE MY HAND
[0:23:18] <leomuratore> Guess Crusader's got better arguments, then.
[0:23:24] <+Shishi1205> I love it vs people waking up
[0:23:28] <@Solidus_113> jump back S is funny
[0:23:34] <+orochiblood> tfw DNF ate KOF's lunch this weekend lmao
[0:23:35] <@Solidus_113> when boosted too
[0:23:42] <Midboss87> dash REJECTED
[0:23:43] <+slayabee> Lobby must be full
[0:23:45] <leomuratore> Jesus he hits like a truck
[0:23:46] <+Shishi1205> @Solidus_113 cover the whole screen almost lmao
[0:23:51] <jorniev> EL señor es una sombra sobre tu mano derecha
[0:23:54] <jaysondeez> @Ellila Its pretty much what early crusader is like. You are not really basic attacking in actual DFO till you unlock the jupiter hammer skills. Otherwise its buffing others or using one shot big spells. at least it was back when I played
[0:24:04] <+Akizea> I wholly implore yall to atleast check out the DFO characters if yall are even remote interested. there are some SUPER sick classes in there
[0:24:09] <%jinking79> still dumb calling Grab button Hold
[0:24:10] <@Solidus_113> did you see the grappler infinite?
[0:24:10] <Mojomoud> God Forgive You because I surely won't
[0:24:14] <KaironFortressKnight> Of course Woolie would main the most holy christian warrior to ever grace a fighting game. Besides Jesus of course.
[0:24:14] <+The_Protagonist> Crusader and Hitman have some maaaajor bullshit
[0:24:17] <LordOfThePoultry> yeyeyeye
[0:24:17] <+Shishi1205> Wheel, fire tornado grapplre infinite and that are agregious
[0:24:18] <bv728> Crusader is likely gonna get nerfed, but yeah
[0:24:20] <Solidnick18> striker Kreygasm
[0:24:21] <%Naedtgio> Naedtgio subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:24:22] <baavetti> Its not rollback, iquisitor seems to be using conversion to cancel their moves
[0:24:24] <sherfman> So its true this beta doesnt work with fight stick right chat?
[0:24:24] <Frampis> Switch character from Crusader to Crusader
[0:24:24] <Idon__> It's crazy how EVERY character design in this game bangs
[0:24:24] <%leith_aziz> @orochiblood It's moreso that people've already experienced KOF with the last beta. As this is DNF's 1st beta, people are more intruiged
[0:24:25] <jaysondeez> There are some amazing character designs on the DFO roster
[0:24:28] <supadata95> is the room full?
[0:24:34] <jorniev> YEYEYEYE
[0:24:35] <Saltmeisterr> LUL
[0:24:35] <jaysondeez> The other female priest one, the mistress of sin
[0:24:36] <huskarl_zap> Gym.aunt Kreygasm
[0:24:36] <xerotwo> BEAT THEM DOWN WITH RELIGION
[0:24:39] <Idon__> that is the most grappler thing to ever say
[0:24:40] <jaysondeez> super sick
[0:24:40] <quietshun> Hitman just feels like he keeps attacking lol
[0:24:45] <bv728> DFO has some good designs
[0:24:45] <leomuratore> @Akizea I saw some on Max's stream. Pretty cool indeed
[0:24:50] <Idon__> Man is just every Grappler combined into one being
[0:24:55] <Frampis> Striker is the protagonist of this game and I refuse to even consider otherwise
[0:24:56] <bv728> They're not too complicated, but they're distinct
[0:25:00] <+The_Protagonist> There are infinites on multiple characters, unfortunately I was trying to learn characters last night and kept running into randos that learned the infinites so I couldn't learn anyone very well haha
[0:25:01] <Arqartur0> Woolz, are you mad!? It's a Sunday, take a break!
[0:25:09] <Midboss87> True test of faith, Wollie vs Punch Girl
[0:25:09] <@Solidus_113> Find the gap against Striker, I dare you
[0:25:10] <%leith_aziz> Feels like Training mode might be important in figuring out bugs or infinites
[0:25:15] <Idon__> The Lord's Day is for Crusader
[0:25:19] <jaysondeez> Sader shouldn't be fighting on the sabbath
[0:25:29] <@Menitta> I can't tell if the room is full or if the search is just awful LUL
[0:25:34] <Frampis> is Striker a Christian?
[0:25:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:25:38] <%leith_aziz> Bonk
[0:25:38] <xerotwo> LUL
[0:25:41] <stormhawk9891> @Arqartur0 It's Sunday Church time
[0:25:42] <+Shishi1205> Being able to A A into wall whenever you want is so good
[0:25:44] <%leith_aziz> pickyAYAYA
[0:25:47] <Estuko> WHEW
[0:25:47] <+Akizea> @leomuratore  yeah Demonic Lancer and agent are my 2 favorite base classes in the game and I like nearly all of their subclasses but vanguard is LITERALLY the lamest one of d.lancers classes
[0:25:48] <+Kenidashi> evoPerfect evoPerfect evoPerfect
[0:25:49] <Deko_> bonked
[0:25:50] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> oh hey i found woolie's room
[0:25:52] <SunsetJack> You think it is worth getting a PS5 controller modded by battle beaver?
[0:25:53] <+The_Protagonist> @Menitta search is trash it like only shows 2 rooms at a time for me lol
[0:25:53] <+Shishi1205> to cancel the install
[0:25:53] <%Irridium> @Menitta both probable LUL
[0:25:54] <Mojomoud> What kind of Aegis reflector Loop Bullshit was that? @WoolieVersus
[0:25:54] <jaysondeez> HOLY MARTIAL ARTS
[0:25:56] <wisconsinjoe> BOP AYE BOP AYE BOP AYE BOP
[0:26:03] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus Who else have you played?
[0:26:06] <Solidnick18> i wanna see dragon knight
[0:26:07] <Idon__> Skirmisher is definitely flashier
[0:26:10] <+Akizea> also, ghostblade is one of the newest characters in the main game so im super surprised he's already in this one
[0:26:13] <%JustToWatch> if you do the back magic super while armored you don't have recovery when the sheild breaks
[0:26:13] <+Shishi1205> @Mojomoud you havent seen anyhting yet with walls
[0:26:13] <%illtima> Would you say this is a beginner-friendly game so far?
[0:26:14] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> i'm ECHAN btw
[0:26:15] <Idon__> And Dragoon got summon spears so he's cool too
[0:26:16] <Solidnick18> thanks
[0:26:16] <Arqartur0> @stormhawk9891 Point taken... Also I'm working in a house project right now >.>
[0:26:26] <+Akizea> I REALLY want dragoon  for d.lancer
[0:26:28] <jaysondeez> ghost blade in dnf looks cool just from the very little they showed
[0:26:32] <Mojomoud> @Shishi1205 If that's the case, then I'm scared
[0:26:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Really wish this thing was on PC or Xbox at least
[0:26:33] <jaysondeez> in terms of translating the design
[0:26:34] <+RDJohnson519> how do you do lazers with crusader?
[0:26:37] <Saltmeisterr> dragon like looks cool
[0:26:39] <sherfman> Im so happy we are in the new era of rollback as the norm, this game feels so good.
[0:26:44] <Idon__> Bro what is this Miku skin
[0:26:45] <+Shishi1205> @Mojomoud you gonna learn about big J today
[0:26:48] <+Ether101_Prime> Found my way onto Korean Youtube and DNF seems to have some wild things coming.
[0:26:49] <+FoxLex_> cross ups arnt a thing, block button exists
[0:26:51] <DoomRedMage> she smol
[0:26:54] <%leith_aziz> Ghostblade gave me some Nero Devilbringer + Devil Trigger vibes
[0:26:54] <%JustToWatch> Sonicfox found some BULLSHIT with Dragon Knight
[0:26:55] <Mirakei> When you do tackle into hammer, hammer combo can you do aganos wall at the end of the combo? If it hits that's great but even if it doesn't it seems like it would set up an advantageous situation
[0:26:56] <KaironFortressKnight> Anyone know how I can narrow down searching for Woolie's room?
[0:26:56] <%Moonblade92> Moonblade92 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Best of luck woolie, remember to use Priest Install to do combo!
[0:27:03] <Arqartur0> So project L is the LoL version of this game.
[0:27:03] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:27:04] <leomuratore> @Akizea So, the one that made it in to the game?! Oh no...
[0:27:07] <+Shishi1205> @FoxLex_ still use hold back to block
[0:27:18] <+Akizea> @ether101_prime yeah, Overkill and proje t bbq look fucking DICK
[0:27:18] <KaironFortressKnight> Hahaha that combo is such bull
[0:27:20] <roz_en> Thankfullly, her grab seems to be ahit and not a grab
[0:27:20] <+Akizea> sick*
[0:27:21] <jaysondeez> yes, buff icons
[0:27:23] <Saltmeisterr> holy shit LUL
[0:27:23] <+Akizea> lol
[0:27:23] <jaysondeez> or debuffs
[0:27:24] <%mr_sups> Man those Hammer Loops are disgusting
[0:27:25] <+Shishi1205> Ranger has some debuffs too
[0:27:26] <xerotwo> Looks like a debuff
[0:27:28] <+dreamcastiszombie> give em a fighting chance :( :(
[0:27:30] <%leith_aziz> Hwen its a beta, expect to discover a lot of bullshit. Go nuts yall
[0:27:31] <Idon__> Hell yeah it does
[0:27:33] <FlowLethal> crusader with one button combo
[0:27:34] <%leith_aziz> *When
[0:27:37] <sherfman> @Arqartur0 thats more like mvc
[0:27:44] <@Menitta> what the fuck LUL
[0:27:46] <+slayabee> So if you try to look for a lobby for too long the game crashes...
[0:27:49] <+Shishi1205> Your install gives you an icon so yellow and blue are buffs?
[0:27:50] <@Menitta> those loops
[0:27:54] <FlowLethal> crusader is best heavy in any fighting game

[0:28:02] <+Ether101_Prime> @Akizea I meant the current game looks to be getting more classes/subclasses.
[0:28:10] <jaysondeez> GOD IS THE GREATEST POWER
[0:28:10] <Mirakei> Arrow up usually means buff. Arrow down usually means debuff
[0:28:10] <KaironFortressKnight> I keep forgetting it exists

[0:29:28] <%Irridium> @Solidus_113 did you use any parameters to narrow it down or just fight the random search until you get it?
[0:29:29] <Mirakei> I'm gonna ask again. Can you do wall at the end of tackle, hammer hammer combo?
[0:29:31] <+Kenidashi> Just oppressive as all hell
[0:29:32] <+Orbit_Boy> fool me once, I forgive you. fool me twice, you're going to hell.

[0:29:39] <OkamiDude15> working as the lord intended
[0:29:45] <+BackwardCap> "Fix"? Its not broke gildedSmug

[0:29:51] <+Superbro64> Reminder that Eighting also released UMVC3 Vergil into the world
[0:29:52] <TimetodiveLTX> crusader seems like a real test of faith
[0:30:03] <+Superbro64> Nothing holy about that Kappa
[0:30:09] <Darlos9D> how many total slots are in the room
[0:30:09] <+Shishi1205> @Mirakei the combo I've been using is AA wall AA wall AA wall and change that last wall for charge or DP if you want
[0:30:19] <sherfman> @Saltmeisterr the troubleshooter
[0:30:19] <%leith_aziz> @Superbro64 But also without any opportunities for patches and cut plans

[0:31:30] <+Orbit_Boy> not enough dragon ladies in fightin' games
[0:31:36] <Idon__> I love how Crusader just looks like my Dark Souls build
[0:31:50] <%JetpackMcQuack> and she has a lil toothless
[0:31:51] <Saltmeisterr> @sherfman Buttons basically described him as ukyo with a stand which seems accurate
[0:31:54] <@Menitta> lmao my beta keeps crashing while I try to find the room
[0:31:54] <+Kenidashi> Dragon Knight feels like heavy offensive with fake-out baits to open their opponent up.
[0:31:57] <+Shishi1205> Oh yeah of course you are buffed today @WoolieVersus Its sunday.
[0:31:57] <+slayabee> Finally here lol
[0:31:58] <%leith_aziz> Do not be blinded Woolie! A crusader needs to keep his eyes straight pickyProud
[0:32:04] <TimetodiveLTX> not enough trogdor's in fighting games
[0:32:05] <KaironFortressKnight> CHARGING CROSS
[0:32:08] <+Ether101_Prime> @Akizea Thats what the tags for the video say.

[0:32:25] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> saturday lasts 48 hours
[0:32:26] <emptyantics> Who does Woolie like in the Beta so far?

[0:32:27] <%jinking79> doodLUL
[0:32:28] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:32:28] <+ForestEX> How much like TvC is this?
[0:32:30] <sherfman> @Saltmeisterr well ukyo is one of my fav samurai showdown

[0:32:35] <artoflec> i didnt know that was a thing to be honest LUL
[0:32:44] <+ForestEX> aside from not a team game of course
[0:32:44] <+Shishi1205> @emptyantics you are seeing the faith boy
[0:32:44] <Idon__> "What day is the Lord's Day?" Crusader: "Every day"
[0:32:47] <jorniev> woolie knows his shit
[0:32:49] <leomuratore> Woolie vs. Sunday
[0:32:51] <bv728> Kinda wish they'd gone with Dragon Knight's Second Awakening design
[0:32:54] <wisconsinjoe> Commandment 11: Thou Shalt Block This Overhead
[0:33:04] <%Major_Lee_> Man i need to work on my christian sects
[0:33:06] <%Moonblade92> btw did anyone tell wooolie qbout manual inpots causing you to regen mana instantly? simple have a cooldown to mana regen
[0:33:07] <+Kenidashi> And *that's* how you counter Crusader. Get in on an attack and get a grab, kills their buff.
[0:33:13] <%leith_aziz> Yall didnt expect Woolie the loremaster to keep track? foolish chat
[0:33:17] <+Orbit_Boy> boy do I wish some of Sundays didn't exist, I'm usually working
[0:33:22] <stormhawk9891> Made it just in time, there was only one slot left
[0:33:36] <+Ether101_Prime> This dude's part of a religion set in his world. Maybe, Sunday's their holly day.
[0:33:38] <KaironFortressKnight> And the lord said: BEST NOT CATCH YOU WHIFFING
[0:33:46] <%JetpackMcQuack> we are all sinners after all
[0:33:48] <+Shishi1205> I love ping ponging enemies with AA wall into AA wall
[0:33:51] <GothicLolitaAngel> Is the room filled now?
[0:33:51] <%Major_Lee_> Thou shalt whiff punish any scrubs
[0:33:54] <slackerunchained> Woolie's Friendship with God: Renewed.
[0:33:56] <Darlos9D> this man is catholic in all but name
[0:34:04] <+JayCWayC> I see, Woolie has gone back to   the forbidden ways. Christianity.
[0:34:05] <+slayabee> Prithee thee catch this mix
[0:34:11] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> sick
[0:34:16] <@Solidus_113> thou shalt run thy set
[0:34:21] <Mirakei> Woolie's playing Dungeon games
[0:34:23] <+Shishi1205> you can do that with ball + wall too
[0:34:28] <%leith_aziz> Me who's not christian: this is akward...
[0:34:28] <jorniev> The weird thing I saw about these characters are that each character has a different subclass with a different design.
[0:34:29] <emptyantics> John 11:76 And thou shalt push block thine enemies
[0:34:33] <Solidnick18> It all came full circle
[0:34:35] <+Shishi1205> they dont expect the wall
[0:34:38] <+Akizea> Commandment 11 thou-shalt-not block thine overhead
[0:34:38] <randomdude365> When you don’t block high : Jesus wept
[0:34:39] <Darlos9D> look if god gave you lightning powers I'd think a lot harder about being an atheist
[0:34:40] <+SilverDevilfish> Church of Saint Fightan James
[0:34:44] <NotHereToStream> i pray everyday just so i can be plus on block

[0:34:50] <%leith_aziz> @jorniev Awakenings. Think level ups that give different looks
[0:34:52] <+Dakuu75> it's time... for a CRUSADE~!
[0:34:53] <%Deasmeister> All it took was a really big hammer
[0:34:54] <+cmac92> Bishop Woolie has returned to Christ!!! riPepperonis riPepperonis riPepperonis
[0:34:57] <emptyantics> Woolie VS GOD: VS EDITION
[0:35:02] <Idon__> And Jesus said "You will deny my mixup 3 times before the round ends"
[0:35:05] <+Orbit_Boy> hey if this dude was in the Bible, I might actually read it.
[0:35:06] <Arqartur0> The Church of Ground Shave Roll
[0:35:07] <%leith_aziz> @Cactuskris Be just or be dead pickyProud
[0:35:14] <Darlos9D> Woolie & God VS Everyone Else
[0:35:17] <emptyantics> @idon__ LUL LUL LUL
[0:35:18] <%Major_Lee_> Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy main
[0:35:24] <roz_en> So how everyones feeling about the game? I'm vibing with it hard myself
[0:35:27] <jorniev> AGANOS
[0:35:33] <+Cactuskris> Woolie is Shawn Micheals he´s got god in his corner now
[0:35:35] <%jinking79> The true power of Anime and God
[0:35:56] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus I think you would get more dmg from doing AA into wall twice before using the charge (neutral MS)
[0:36:03] <+ElDragon_1> No longer Woolie VS God. Woolie is BACK IN
[0:36:09] <%Moonblade92> dragon Knights's damage seems a tad low. or is it just me?
[0:36:10] <Josef_Stryker> So does Crusader have an Aegis Reflector?
[0:36:23] <Darlos9D> @roz_en I think the game maybe needs grounded overheads or... something. when I fight strikers I sorta just end up in the corner downbacking and I don't really have to look out for much in the way of mixup
[0:36:26] <+Shishi1205> If you want to conserve mana then charge is good
[0:36:27] <roz_en> @Josef_Stryker He brings up a wall that hits on the way up
[0:36:28] <%leith_aziz> @roz_en My thoughts: Im on PC...
[0:36:36] <%Moonblade92> @josef_stryker No he has Aganos Wall.
[0:36:37] <@Solidus_113> less reflector more aganos
[0:36:38] <GeltonZ> @ElDragon_1 Woolie X God
[0:36:41] <Treasure_Vault> Gotta say, love bighammer. Always a fan of bighammer.
[0:36:45] <emptyantics> WOOLIE VS GOD
[0:36:46] <+Shishi1205> @roz_en like it alot
[0:36:47] <%Major_Lee_> There's some dirty crusader stuff on twitter
[0:36:48] <%Shad0wTag> God shall smite the Hatsune Miku
[0:36:49] <@Menitta> yeah it's def an aganos wall
[0:36:54] <Qsmash_> @Moonblade92 Crusader has high HP
[0:36:55] <+Akizea> the only actual change I'd make to this game is give everyone an airdash and then give  dragon knight like 2
[0:36:56] <%Irridium> i think inquisitor is neat
[0:37:02] <%jamsbybetty> waiting to see if they add a weirdo character like Faust or Teddie
[0:37:07] <Solidnick18> YOOO
[0:37:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> ye
[0:37:12] <+Shishi1205> bro theres so many oportun ities to confirm into super
[0:37:16] <GeltonZ> @Moonblade92 This is a low damage game. Crusader is just a powerhouse.
[0:37:27] <Solidnick18> Makes sense
[0:37:31] <+SquirrelZOD> Hammertime Jesus doesn't mess around.
[0:37:31] <+Shishi1205> magical faithy hammer
[0:37:31] <%leith_aziz> Hammer Bros
[0:37:36] <KaironFortressKnight> There's not enough Christ in this hammer
[0:37:40] <Treasure_Vault> Big hammer is a good conduit to summon BIG HAMMER
[0:37:41] <Afrosamasenpai> Big hammers are cool, do you blame him?
[0:37:41] <thinktank1> sometimes you just need a bigger hammer
[0:37:42] <%JustToWatch> the hammer is a conduit for bigger hammer
[0:37:45] <Wixvhen> Man, in the original Dungeon Fighter Online, I was a basic launcher PVP player. Or slayer.
[0:37:46] <%Major_Lee_> I feel like I should give dfo another chance every time i see this game
[0:37:47] <@Menitta> and on the 8th day, God created hit confirms
[0:37:48] <roz_en> @Darlos9D Strikers pressure and mix is insane in the corner yeah. Its fighterz esque
[0:37:51] <slackerunchained> Solaire vs. A Dragon Acolyte.
[0:37:55] <+Shishi1205> yeyeyeye
[0:37:56] <randomdude365> This matchup seems hard for dragon knight
[0:37:57] <FlowLethal> A mortal hammer can only do so much
[0:37:59] <chuffybunny> I'd be disappointed we didn't get Avenger if Crusader didn't look so sick.
[0:37:59] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> beast
[0:37:59] <roz_en> @Darlos9D Speaking as a striker player
[0:37:59] <+Shishi1205> I love crusader
[0:38:01] <leomuratore> As if he needed an even bigger hammer
[0:38:02] <wisconsinjoe> Hammer Loops coneyWOKE
[0:38:03] <+Kenidashi> Hmm, looking at DK's damage...yeah she actually isn't doing much damage...
[0:38:09] <+3d_pbandj> the hammer can't contain all his faith
[0:38:15] <@Solidus_113> oh there's people
[0:38:17] <+slayabee> We're pretty full up
[0:38:18] <@Menitta> I bet it's full
[0:38:20] <@Menitta> damn
[0:38:22] <Darlos9D> his hammer has a stand, its a bigger hammer
[0:38:30] <+FoxLex_> I hit refresh right when I saw you lobby
[0:38:32] <%DomPressesButtons> God Cannot be Stopped
[0:38:33] <Arqartur0> I can't stop thinking he looks like a WoW character.
[0:38:35] <+SaurianCrash> DK has to wear people down'
[0:38:41] <Solidnick18> wow
[0:38:44] <Civet10> D:
[0:38:44] <emptyantics> @darlos9d Hammer Time
[0:38:44] <stormhawk9891> @Solidus_113 Wait did you actually que up for a match yet or are just standing there?
[0:38:48] <AngryAsian5> The hammer is big because it's full of MERCY
[0:38:48] <%Irridium> still haven't even seen the lobby :(
[0:38:49] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus His install is called the sussy install btw. He says Amongus when he activates it
[0:38:51] <roz_en> @roz_en rip
[0:38:51] <Solidnick18> dragon abuse
[0:38:54] <@Solidus_113> I'm waiting in line
[0:38:55] <wisconsinjoe> Woolie is basically playing this guy in Dark Souls too
[0:38:55] <TimetodiveLTX> this is like if Roa stayed with the church
[0:39:00] <%leith_aziz> @Shishi1205 BOOOOOOO
[0:39:01] <+Paegis> @Arqartur0 nah, shoulder pads aren't twice as wide as he is
[0:39:03] <%Moonblade92> also everyone on about Inquisitor Wheel but getting caught by Crusader in Install is like, half your HP
[0:39:05] <FlowLethal> Why does heavy have like 4 projectiles a wall  a rush attack etc
[0:39:12] <@Menitta> I also can't find the lobby. and if it's full it won't show up LUL
[0:39:12] <KalmVibrations> I think you can only cancel DPs on block or on whiff
[0:39:15] <@Menitta> rip
[0:39:16] <BlackermanZX> Woolz playin some bible games huh
[0:39:18] <+Shishi1205> @FlowLethal jesus. Thats why
[0:39:34] <Mirakei> I think it'd be interesting if you could only use the guard cancel if you blocked holding back.
[0:39:42] <stormhawk9891> @Solidus_113 Oh, cause I kinda qued up first, should I hang back and let you go first?
[0:39:47] <+pupil31> Bibble Games
[0:39:50] <Mirakei> to distinguish it from the block button
[0:39:50] <enddword> HeyGuys
[0:39:54] <Wixvhen> Wait, is the Monk class in here?
[0:39:55] <Solidnick18> wow
[0:40:05] <+Eric_Spells_Rice> @WoolieVersus ggs woolie!
[0:40:08] <OkamiDude15> monk isnt included
[0:40:08] <+chefframza> When is Battle Fantasia getting roll back?
[0:40:08] <%leith_aziz> And in a flash, Woolie's followes showed up
[0:40:08] <+Akizea> @wixvhen nope
[0:40:18] <Wixvhen> Dropping the hammer and going for punches in a fighting game would have been perfect.
[0:40:20] <Wixvhen> Oh well.
[0:40:26] <stormhawk9891> Oh well I guess
[0:40:29] <xiccy> @Wixvhen No, the monk isn't. They went with the tier whore instead
[0:40:33] <Wixvhen> Complete with that ducking in and out of boxing range.
[0:40:34] <GeltonZ> @Wixvhen Not yet but it could still come. They just revealed a second F.Slayer and second Agent
[0:40:37] <+Shishi1205> Im rocking Crusader colour 2
[0:40:39] <emptyantics> I just want GRANBLUE to have ROLLBACK NotLikeThis :(
[0:40:39] <+pupil31> SourPls
[0:40:40] <Solidnick18> Ranger
[0:40:46] <+3d_pbandj> But can God beat Gun??
[0:40:48] <KaironFortressKnight> Monk is a boxer
[0:40:51] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Monk is this guy but as a Boxer
[0:40:52] <bv728> Monk is an alternate Priest
[0:40:54] <KaironFortressKnight> Holy Boxer
[0:40:57] <leomuratore> GOD vs. GUN
[0:40:58] <+Nobuwaroo> woolie would love monk
[0:40:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Gun vs God.
[0:41:03] <slackerunchained> *tch Ahouuuuu~!* / Dragon Knight: Crusader? What's that sound? / Crusader: Why that's Jesus, DK. " :)
[0:41:06] <+Kenidashi> I'm gonna be fiending for this game until Summer, man...
[0:41:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[0:41:08] <wisconsinjoe> Need Monk to be unga so we get Monke memes
[0:41:09] <emptyantics> GOD VS SMITH & WESSON
[0:41:12] <+pupil31> GOD TRIGGER
[0:41:20] <+BoBoCatBurger> good im really hoping avenger and or mistress get added as character i want my devil trigger boy (and girl)
[0:41:23] <%Prevot> didn't hit me until now but woolie is totally picking the Ky colors huh
[0:41:25] <%Moonblade92> this should be a noghtmare for Woolie, considering what Ranger's basics are.
[0:41:28] <Solidnick18> bang bang bang
[0:41:29] <bv728> His class thing is he literally carries a totem and slams it into the group to create a fighting ring.
[0:41:32] <+slayabee> Jehova's Witness ass pressure
[0:41:35] <roz_en> Is it me, or has Arcsys's backgrounds been kinda empty lately?
[0:41:42] <+Shishi1205> I love the sound the AA makes
[0:41:45] <+Ether101_Prime> I wonder what the chances of Spectre getting in? Thought she was a shoe in but then Ghost Blade was shown to be in the game so now I'm not too sure.
[0:41:46] <+Akizea> @moonblade92 nah
[0:41:47] <+Shishi1205> Sounds like two jabs
[0:41:52] <%jinking79> never let him touch his guns
[0:41:53] <@Solidus_113> use the roll
[0:41:53] <+3d_pbandj> Lay hands was to powerful for GUN
[0:41:56] <slackerunchained> Hol Horse?
[0:41:58] <+Shishi1205> Wall his ass @WoolieVersus
[0:41:58] <emptyantics> @slayabee LUL
[0:42:00] <enddword> ARMOR UP
[0:42:15] <Kusano123> @roz_en for sure
[0:42:21] <BlackermanZX> the new ghostblade guy looks pretty cool
[0:42:24] <+Dakuu75> woolie not standing for this injustice-shit lol
[0:42:24] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> get blessed
[0:42:28] <%DomPressesButtons> bringing guns to the house of the lord how dare ye!
[0:42:29] <BlackermanZX> i wonder if hes gonna play like a samsho character
[0:42:31] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus How many sets?
[0:42:34] <TrevIn3Dimensions> TrevIn3Dimensions subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! lytJIVE
[0:42:36] <+Orbit_Boy> Rangers keeping him back, but Cru has a surprising amount of range.
[0:42:36] <+Dakuu75> "get blessed on" lol
[0:42:38] <bv728> Spectre is brand new, so it's questionable, I'm expecting Vagabond or Dark Templar
[0:42:39] <%jinking79> fuck the gun
[0:42:43] <Civet10> my one issue with this game is supers feel like they take a year
[0:42:49] <+Ether101_Prime> @roz_en Their publishing. The game was made by 8ing.
[0:42:54] <bv728> Demon Slayer would be visually distinct
[0:42:55] <+Shishi1205> nooo
[0:42:59] <xiccy> I wish we got the Asura instead of the Ghost Blade
[0:43:00] <@Solidus_113> fuck
[0:43:00] <+slayabee> FUCK
[0:43:01] <slackerunchained> Woolie Priesting all over these guys. :P
[0:43:01] <Darlos9D> oooh
[0:43:01] <bv728> But they already have Berserker
[0:43:02] <+Kenidashi> POOF
[0:43:09] <KaironFortressKnight> It is a Beta, it's kinda normal
[0:43:09] <%Irridium> I HAVE A CHANCE AGAIN
[0:43:12] <+Orbit_Boy> God has forsaken you.
[0:43:12] <%Major_Lee_> everyone get disconnected?
[0:43:14] <emptyantics> DUDE THE CONNECTION SUCKS
[0:43:16] <FlowLethal> With ghost blade. I don’t know or they are don’t creator and dark knight
[0:43:16] <+pupil31> SourPls
[0:43:16] <+3d_pbandj> But what if you had a God Gun?
[0:43:19] <leomuratore> Damn
[0:43:20] <+JayCWayC> Wow. I thought thatd be fix by now
[0:43:20] <+Akizea> @bv728 ghostblade just got added so it doesn't matter how new the class is
[0:43:25] <%DomPressesButtons> RIIIIIP
[0:43:25] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus can be both
[0:43:27] <BlackermanZX> i remember max kinda fixing it by not pressing ok and letting the other guy win
[0:43:30] <+Parlux> Woolie. The south bronx says hello.
[0:43:37] <emptyantics> Hopefully they have a second CBT and adress all these issues
[0:43:38] <Wixvhen> Slayer subclasses were MADE for this. Soulbender, Swordmaster, Asura, Berserker. Not a single one of them wouldn't be awesome in a fighting game.
[0:43:40] <%jinking79> the shitty part of the beta all week
[0:43:44] <+TheScorpionEater> hopefully this is what the beta is fixing
[0:43:48] <stormhawk9891> @BlackermanZX Naw it disconnected me too
[0:43:51] <+Kenidashi> @BlackermanZX Exactly, seems to ignore it after the first game
[0:43:52] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:43:52] <GeltonZ> Good thing they did this Beta! The netcode seems good but the matchmaking needs some work.
[0:43:52] <+Parlux> Chillin Wools
[0:43:53] <roz_en> @roz_en Eightings designing the game, but I'm pretty sure Arcsys is doing the visual design
[0:43:55] <slackerunchained> Plattsburgh says Hello, too, woolie. ;)
[0:43:57] <@Menitta> 8ING 8ONG
[0:43:59] <Solidnick18> idk
[0:44:00] <+LCGOV> So what are the initial impressions of this game so far? How
[0:44:00] <enddword> AYOOOO cmonBruh
[0:44:01] <%Shad0wTag> Isn't Asura in the latest trailer?
[0:44:08] <BlackermanZX> @stormhawk9891 damn so that doesnt work now either
[0:44:12] <OkamiDude15> apparently you can get rid of the disconnection notification if you finish the match and rematch. your just locked out of using your mp specials
[0:44:16] <FlowLethal> Ghost blade is in trailer
[0:44:17] <+tigerstyle96> B I N G B O N G
[0:44:18] <BlackermanZX> well i hope they fix it next time
[0:44:18] <+Akizea> @shad0wtag no that was ghostblade
[0:44:20] <Coolest_Joke> nice
[0:44:22] <GeltonZ> @Shad0wTag Ghost Knight actually.
[0:44:23] <Solidnick18> wassup baby... let me take you to dinner.
[0:44:25] <emptyantics> IF YOU SEE THESE DOGS OUTSIDE
[0:44:28] <Saltmeisterr> wtf is bing bong?
[0:44:29] <Wixvhen> Asura would be such a nuker, I'd have a hard time balancing it.
[0:44:31] <+Parlux> No bing bong isn't a thing
[0:44:35] <+Parlux> But whats goodie is
[0:44:36] <emptyantics> B I N G  B O N G

[0:44:53] <%Moonblade92> holy wars? Holy wars.
[0:44:57] <roz_en> This chick has the scariest screen control tool I've seen in a WHILE
[0:45:04] <Arqartur0> Bing bong is NY lies, from Yoisy
[0:45:05] <+Orbit_Boy> RELIGIOUS WAR.
[0:45:06] <bv728> @Akizea Ghostblade got global release three years ago, longer before that in Korea.
[0:45:11] <Civet10> gavlan wheel, gavlan deal.
[0:45:12] <%JetpackMcQuack> Bing bong is great either way
[0:45:13] <+Akizea> literally all imma say is don't write off ANY class for this game. everyone has a solid as fuck chance of showing up
[0:45:13] <emptyantics> CHRISTAIN VS CATHOLIC
[0:45:14] <+Shishi1205> gg
[0:45:18] <+pupil31> KEK
[0:45:20] <+slayabee> We in there
[0:45:23] <OkamiDude15> @dark_kebabs try to download it from the website
[0:45:25] <Darkred28> WHAT THE FUCK
[0:45:26] <enddword> cheap
[0:45:26] <+Orbit_Boy> ITS THE TROUBLES
[0:45:27] <+Parrish_broadnax> YOU CANT just do that
[0:45:27] <gunstars20> Inqusitor needs to stop burning people
[0:45:28] <boti_balint> that seems fair LUL
[0:45:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @big_oki
[0:45:31] <+Parrish_broadnax> That was a Sin
[0:45:31] <slackerunchained> Nobody expects the Anime inquisition!
[0:45:33] <emptyantics> CATHOLIC VS CHRISTIAN
[0:45:34] <%JetpackMcQuack> S C H I S M
[0:45:35] <BlackermanZX> behold the holy combo
[0:45:36] <+Parlux> I can give you real goofy NY saying. like "Thats bussin" which means thats really good
[0:45:37] <Mirakei> Is this game releasing on PS4 and PS5 only?
[0:45:40] <+chefframza> who need complex combos when you have God
[0:45:40] <big_oki> just like john henery
[0:45:41] <Darlos9D> does the inquisitor have rebuttal to this argument?
[0:45:42] <+Shishi1205> Grounded install release can also be used to end it
[0:45:45] <roz_en> @dark_kebabs Also, look up DNF duel, and not dungeon fighter
[0:45:45] <dark_kebabs> @okamidude15 ok thx
[0:45:47] <AstrodropGaming> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:45:55] <+TheScorpionEater> Martin Luther nailing the door (Colorized)
[0:46:01] <+SilverDevilfish> Spanish Religious Oppression vs French Justification for raiding the Levant. Go
[0:46:15] <+FoxLex_> annnnd I crashed while searching
[0:46:20] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Grounded install release can also be used to end the wall B loop
[0:46:22] <+Ether101_Prime> You know, Ghost Blade might be the boss of the game. Would have thought that they'd go for Dark Knight or bringing in one of the NPCs for that role.
[0:46:23] <KaironFortressKnight> Bible studies is fucking hardcore
[0:46:25] <odd_slater> I feel like Crusader has an answer for everything against the two characters I wanna play (Kunoichi, Striker)
[0:46:26] <%Moonblade92> this Inquisitor hasn't awoken to the secret tech of using all your MP on Fire Wheel I see
[0:46:28] <nochejunior> Inquisitor: spin to win
[0:46:29] <Mirakei> @SilverDevilfish Round 1 Pray!
[0:46:31] <randomdude365> Speeen
[0:46:31] <KalmVibrations> Challenging that buff is almost always suicide
[0:46:38] <+Akizea> Avenger would be fun too
[0:46:42] <+Shishi1205> so you dont get the headache
[0:46:44] <roz_en> That wheel is so big and dumb, I love it. FUCK your screen space, its mine now
[0:46:44] <FlowLethal> Crusader can let his student win
[0:46:46] <+LCGOV> Crusader looking like a beast
[0:46:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Is he using the power og God and Anime?
[0:46:48] <+Akizea> just a full on install charater
[0:46:51] <%jinking79> no oil toss
[0:46:52] <GeltonZ> @odd_slater Double jumps and teleports are your friend with Kunoichi...good luck with Striker
[0:46:53] <FlowLethal> Can’t *
[0:46:58] <+sonofthedeepsouth> He certainly is
[0:47:04] <+BoBoCatBurger> god i hope avenger is added
[0:47:09] <Darlos9D> can't for the life of me find this room
[0:47:09] <+Ether101_Prime> @sonofthedeepsouth I think its some little short person.
[0:47:09] <emptyantics> I want to get gud with Kunoichi
[0:47:11] <Wixvhen> Oh, right. Not sure if Woolie knows this. In the original game, all these moves had the normal 'activate the skill by using the skill on your bar' but you could also fighting game style input commands.
[0:47:12] <nochejunior> perfect damn
[0:47:12] <@Menitta> Oh wow it just showed me like 15 rooms
[0:47:13] <+Shishi1205> yeah its the only issue with that
[0:47:19] <Azelstahn> troubleshooter and F.Mechanic seem like interesting choices with ghostblade
[0:47:23] <wisconsinjoe> What does his install do
[0:47:25] <+Shishi1205> @Menitta wild, I've only ever seen max 4
[0:47:30] <@Menitta> same
[0:47:31] <odd_slater> @geltonz Yeah I can try to get stuff going of a TP but I fight for my fucking life with Striker LUL
[0:47:38] <%Plus_On_Black> What's good, Money?
[0:47:38] <emptyantics> Ghostblade is IN Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:47:39] <+tempestzephyr> throwing those piss bottles
[0:47:39] <OkamiDude15> @wisconsinjoe enhanced normals and 2 new moves
[0:47:48] <GeltonZ> @odd_slater YES. YES YOU ARE.
[0:47:52] <wisconsinjoe> Ooh tight
[0:47:55] <+FoxLex_> I'M IN
[0:47:59] <+Shishi1205> 2B her when you throw the fireball to try and catch the command dahs
[0:48:03] <+SaurianCrash> <- Striker Main
[0:48:06] <+slayabee> yoooo
[0:48:06] <+Akizea> the only thing I want more than dragoon is literally ANY f.slayer class
[0:48:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:48:09] <chuffybunny> Really hoping Blood Mage gets added. I'd love to see how they translate the teleport and command grab super.
[0:48:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> No training mode yet? Online trenches shall be your teacher
[0:48:13] <+Parlux> So we getting a full playthough of the star wars david cage game with reggie and mihn?
[0:48:15] <+TheScorpionEater> Crusader really makes me wish for an airdash in this game
[0:48:21] <+Shishi1205> @sonofthedeepsouth that and twitter
[0:48:23] <%Plus_On_Black> I can't find yo ass at all
[0:48:29] <+solzan2000> hell no to airdash lol
[0:48:39] <+Shishi1205> No air block
[0:48:39] <Wixvhen> Wait, they got the berserker, but not swordmaster? That's confusing, actually.
[0:48:41] <@Menitta> the pub is the best stage
[0:48:42] <@Solidus_113> why are these lobby systems always so wack
[0:48:43] <+Ether101_Prime> Wouldn't it be crazy if this game got a sequel with all the playable classes with the subclasses being grooves?
[0:48:45] <KaironFortressKnight> Woolie is too hard to find damn
[0:48:54] <%Plus_On_Black> I found yo ass lol
[0:48:54] <slackerunchained> Apparently a LOT of people are getting upset over that Quantic Dream Star Wars game.
[0:49:00] <+SaurianCrash> beta test
[0:49:01] <emptyantics> @ether101_prime That’d be fuckin sick
[0:49:02] <Sabbrewolf> Beta's gonna beta.
[0:49:05] <+Eijiken> if its full, people cant join or find it
[0:49:06] <@Menitta> this does list names but only like...3
[0:49:07] <+Akizea> @ether101_prime that's what I was hoping the first time through tbh
[0:49:11] <%Major_Lee_> why do jp devs love these lobby systems?
[0:49:13] <+Shishi1205> @slackerunchained star wars normiues
[0:49:18] <+Parlux> Yeah whats that about in fighting games? why are lobbies such shit
[0:49:21] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie with the old crusader colors
[0:49:24] <%Shad0wTag> We got a summer release date so here is hoping for this to be sorted out in a second beta by then
[0:49:30] <Wixvhen> Damn, the man got him with his own super.
[0:49:33] <+Risingxiv> using his own wall against him
[0:49:37] <+RustyCoyoteA> @menitta then you search again and get like 8, then 1
[0:49:37] <odd_slater> I got a hard time against Hitman as well
[0:49:38] <+TheScorpionEater> something something its like being at a virtual arcade
[0:49:48] <+Crunchy_the_clown> what odes he have the room set for?
[0:49:49] <+Ether101_Prime> @slackerunchained There's two reasons for that. Its Quantic Dreams and its set in the High Republic which is a plot hole setting.
[0:49:53] <FlowLethal> Ark system loves avatar lobbies
[0:49:53] <santietch> has woolie played with another character other than crusader?
[0:49:54] <+SnipeOrigin> How do you input the light arrow?
[0:49:56] <+Shishi1205> @Crunchy_the_clown default
[0:49:59] <Mirakei> i find it interesting that mp costs aren't required to be able to use a move in this. So at 100 MP inquisitor can fire wheel twice despite it costing 90 mp
[0:50:04] <supadata95> wats the room settings
[0:50:05] <+Parlux> fighting game lobby should be like fightcade. Chat room of people poppin off, cashing checks their asses can't cash
[0:50:06] <+sonofthedeepsouth> God says fuck that guy
[0:50:06] <+Shishi1205> @SnipeOrigin forward S
[0:50:07] <roz_en> @TheScorpionEater At least it doesn't say "LOBBY FULL" when you try to sit at a station for the first five minutes
[0:50:16] <+solzan2000> avatar lobbies are great when they work
[0:50:24] <+TopTieramisu> the slamfinite
[0:50:29] <Darkred28> Christ that's unfair LUL

[0:51:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Can't nerf the crusader thats a sin.
[0:51:10] <+TheScorpionEater> @TheScorpionEater needs more "UNABLE TO CONNECT TO DUEL STATION"
[0:51:12] <+Shishi1205> @SnipeOrigin the disco ball?
[0:51:14] <+LCGOV> has crusader been one of the top characters in the beta?
[0:51:17] <randomdude365> Crusader is oppressive
[0:51:24] <+Superbro64> @darkred28 Christ you say?😳
[0:51:24] <%Moonblade92> i wonder if Hitman can dash under the Holyball like DK can
[0:51:28] <+Parlux> When we gonna get woolie 63 streams again, just sayin tho
[0:51:34] <+SnipeOrigin> no the air borne light arrow
[0:51:42] <+Shishi1205> @SnipeOrigin jump MS
[0:51:46] <+Shishi1205> hold it
[0:51:48] <odd_slater> Crusader got in airpods playing Donda while doing that hammer combo
[0:51:48] <+SnipeOrigin> of its the light ball just while air borne
[0:51:52] <Mirakei> All is fair in love and war. Everything is unfair in religious crusades
[0:51:59] <Darkred28> Posture check
[0:52:11] <7c_nickel> @WoolieVersus Have you seen the Brawler archetype from DFO?  Fighters who say screw meditation and ki and shit, I'm just gonna hit people with a brick and inject them with sedatives.  I really hope we get one here eventually.

[0:53:32] <Wixvhen> @Parlux Actually, this game is inspired by an extremely old MMO game called Dungeon Fighter Online.
[0:53:33] <slackerunchained> @7c_nickel Actually, Woolie playing this legit made me create a Crusader character in DFO and it's proving really fun so far. :)
[0:53:34] <Solidnick18> 👼🏻 BOP

[0:53:41] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Not even KoF 2000 Lul
[0:53:42] <KaironFortressKnight> Man, Vanguard has such a sick design
[0:53:43] <+Parlux> OHH SHIT THIS IS DFO?
[0:53:44] <roz_en> slow movement, regenerating resources. Main difference seems to be they WILD moves
[0:53:44] <BlackermanZX> tbf DFO is goddamn ancient at this point
[0:53:46] <@Menitta> I still play KOF2002 with friends
[0:53:49] <+Ether101_Prime> DFO's still a thing.
[0:53:51] <Wixvhen> YUP!
[0:53:53] <its_uni__> what’s the consensus on vanguard cuz i feel like he’s crazy strong
[0:53:55] <%jinking79> Vanguard Poke Poke Neutral
[0:53:58] <%Major_Lee_> Holy combos
[0:53:58] <+Akizea> dfo unironically holds up still imo
[0:54:01] <+Parlux> oh man I'm happy they made a come back with a fighting game
[0:54:01] <+Crunchy_the_clown> is the room full?
[0:54:03] <+Parlux> good for them
[0:54:05] <quietshun> DFO has been going since like 2005, yeah
[0:54:05] <@Menitta> when did DFO come out
[0:54:06] <Afrosamasenpai> LORDS LOOPS IS STRONG
[0:54:07] <GeltonZ> DFO was 2005 and yeah still going.
[0:54:10] <@Menitta> ah
[0:54:13] <FlowLethal> Dfo is like 15 years old
[0:54:16] <+Shishi1205> @its_uni__ I waall his ass and spam balls
[0:54:24] <Wixvhen> Welcome to feeling even older.
[0:54:25] <odd_slater> I wouldn't be surprised if this game has an RPG mode like GBVS for single player stuff
[0:54:29] <Mirakei> Vanguard is a real Justin Wong type character. Long ass normals and mad chip damage. Gonna lame your ass out
[0:54:31] <+Akizea> dfo and league both are popping off with projects lol
[0:54:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Peed On woolie?
[0:54:33] <Mirakei> and i love it
[0:54:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Good
[0:54:38] <+TheScorpionEater> I love that neutral is actually FULL SCREEN LUL
[0:54:41] <roz_en> @its_uni__ He's good, but he seems to die to low profile moves, like a lot of characters do currently
[0:54:43] <Arqartur0> I got stuck with KoF 2000, but I still poke my fighting-game face in the new stuff, I'm actually amazed at Guilty Gear, and I still love Actress Again
[0:54:47] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Atleast not peed on Woolie
[0:54:51] <KaironFortressKnight> @TheScorpionEater the fuck is a neutral
[0:54:53] <Wixvhen> Man, imagine them trying to get Launcher in here.
[0:54:58] <emptyantics> I found DFO through MUGEN and the use of it’s sprites
[0:54:59] <+Shishi1205> yeah that happens to me too
[0:55:00] <KaironFortressKnight> (that's sarcasm btw)
[0:55:01] <+SnipeOrigin> if crJab plus on block?
[0:55:04] <Wixvhen> Those half screen swings with a gun too big to use.
[0:55:10] <+SnipeOrigin> is*
[0:55:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:55:10] <bv728> As someone who played a bunch of Vanguard, I love that I can see my DFO attack strings in this
[0:55:15] <+Parlux> kof 2000 was good. I liked all those nests era ones. I had like all the ps2 era KOF games
[0:55:19] <Darkred28> That fucking range
[0:55:21] <Arqartur0> @emptyantics Me too! Jojos as well, and a Garou
[0:55:29] <+slayabee> Whoever is in next can go after me
[0:55:38] <Saltmeisterr> its pokey mcpokster over here
[0:55:38] <+Akizea> Shame that vanguard is his lamest looking class lol
[0:55:40] <+Shishi1205> I just keep blocking vanguard
[0:55:43] <%jinking79> he got away with it
[0:55:51] <+RobertWayneLewis98> Yall be playing fighting games at least, I just stick with minecraft So I truly don't belong here lol
[0:55:53] <Solidnick18> nice
[0:55:54] <+Shishi1205> Bc I dont know when his strings end
[0:55:54] <KaironFortressKnight> YO that looked SICK
[0:55:55] <its_uni__> i honestly can’t wait for this game to come out cuz it feels like some of the most fun ive had with a fighting game recently
[0:55:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Believe Woolie
[0:55:58] <@Menitta> that down aerial move can confirm into super
[0:56:02] <Wixvhen> How are they gonna pull off the launcher's combo of upward kick into minigun into flamethrower/sticking launcher?
[0:56:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Should have believed more
[0:56:08] <Solidnick18> Seems like a good pick
[0:56:11] <skagtheprinceofhell> I mean Dynasty Warrior is pretty good look
[0:56:11] <%jinking79> i need this match knowledge
[0:56:22] <Arqartur0> WTF is up at the sky? God watching the match?
[0:56:24] <slackerunchained> Man even the sky has sigils in Anime-Land...
[0:56:29] <Saltmeisterr> so is this game just cooler granblue?
[0:56:30] <emptyantics> This match is 3-7 matchup
[0:56:31] <odd_slater> Oppression session as Yipes would say
[0:56:36] <+Akizea> I REALLY wanna know how they're gonna handle 2nd and Neo awakenings

[0:58:09] <Wixvhen> Man, if this game had a single player mode, I'd need to see boss fights against the big boss monsters like Behemoth and such.
[0:58:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie letting slip through his fingers
[0:58:15] <GeltonZ> @Arqartur0 Nah it's just that the upper and lower worlds are divided by the Middle Ocean. The world above the ocean is where Gunner comes from, they're more technologically advanced...and tall. He fell.
[0:58:22] <+thedream_c> oh shit someone is playing Christian Man
[0:58:23] <+Shishi1205> that might be the most useless of crusaders moves down s
[0:58:30] <+thedream_c> looks like this is a religious stream now
[0:58:34] <+Parlux> Yo woolie, you think free to play route is the future for fighting games?
[0:58:39] <peeton35> Vanguard is so sick

[0:58:59] <emptyantics> WE STAY HUNGRY
[0:59:10] <NotHereToStream> one of the 10 commandments, RESPECT ME ON PLUS
[0:59:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Wait I think Doomguy is qlso catholic I think
[0:59:25] <+Shishi1205> Some combos/strings in this game look like cutscenes lmao
[0:59:27] <FlowLethal> Woolie was priest in dokapon and now this game
[0:59:31] <bigarmsnolegs> a beat em up mode for this game would be amazing and be true to the source material
[0:59:33] <Mirakei> Do not covet thine neighbours stick
[0:59:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie was always back in
[0:59:45] <+thedream_c> God held block stun for 6 days and on the 7th day, he decided to be super plus and made it HOLY
[0:59:47] <+Parlux> Woolie playing a holy character in a video game. Darlingtons mother: Are ya winnin son?
[0:59:49] <+Akizea> oh god if this game has a beat em up mode Holy shit
[0:59:57] <+RustyCoyoteA> Good shit!
[1:00:10] <GeltonZ> @Akizea The original MMO is a beat 'em up
[1:00:13] <%jinking79> let's go Vanguard
[1:00:17] <+Shishi1205> bro everytime that dp dmg is insane
[1:00:18] <Wixvhen> @Akizea That's what the original game was, so I wouldn't be surprised if they added something for that.
[1:00:19] <+Akizea> @geltonz I know lol
[1:00:25] <+Ether101_Prime> Wait, I think I've seen this background in DFO.
[1:00:27] <+SaurianCrash> @Akizea yeah but its another game called dfo lol
[1:00:27] <+thedream_c> it would add mad value to the gametoo
[1:00:30] <Mirakei> Thou shalt finish thine plate
[1:00:31] <+Akizea> it'd still be sick if they went that hard
[1:00:32] <%MajorCrasher> why does everyone keep asking for a beat'em up mode? that's literally what DFO is lol
[1:00:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Was the Snake in the garden a gimmick character?
[1:00:37] <Wixvhen> At the very least a survival mode jobber shadow enemies thing
[1:00:40] <GeltonZ> @Ether101_Prime Yeah that's Hendon Myre, pretty much the hub town
[1:00:41] <+thedream_c> for a DNF DUel to have a beat em up portion
[1:00:45] <+RustyCoyoteA> 8ing made something really special here!
[1:00:48] <skagtheprinceofhell> Getting used to these controls is weird but it's cool at the same time
[1:00:53] <cookingwithsmeg> When is Guilty Gear Judgement 2
[1:00:57] <+Akizea> people keep asking for a beat em up mode because it'd be A LOT of work to add on top of the regular game imo
[1:00:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Was Adam low tier?
[1:00:59] <BlackermanZX> man if they add another gunner class i hope its Female Launcher or Mechanic
[1:01:11] <emptyantics> It’s crazy Woolie and Rooflemonger main CRUSADER
[1:01:11] <+SnipeOrigin> yeah @woolieversus LL Wall LL Buff and go is pretty sick
[1:01:13] <@Menitta> ooooh
[1:01:15] <GeltonZ> Fun Fact: 8ing has a deal with a local college to do Work Study programs on game development. Been doing that for a bit.
[1:01:15] <+Methodcobra> I often struggle vs crusader match up
[1:01:18] <+RustyCoyoteA> Ooooo mirror match
[1:01:19] <Wixvhen> It'd probably be female mechanic, launcher's too big.
[1:01:20] <+thedream_c> God grant me the range and active frames, so I may hit on counter every swing. As I pray, AMEN
[1:01:20] <KaironFortressKnight> @BlackermanZX Female Mechanic was confirmed today

[1:08:30] <Arqartur0> @SunnySideX thank you
[1:08:31] <slackerunchained> Deus Vult, Sister.
[1:08:33] <BlackermanZX> a bit low
[1:08:38] <%leith_aziz> pickyEZ
[1:08:38] <critfumble_> hallowed be thy frames, amen
[1:08:38] <odd_slater> @veylmantherock Who do you use? I gotta kinda lame him out with Kunoichi
[1:08:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thanks
[1:08:40] <SebTheFuturist> Petition to call the strat with buffed Crusader repeatedly slamming an enemy into his Aganos wall with empower hammer "The Confessional"
[1:08:41] <emptyantics> Deus Vult
[1:08:42] <chernabogs_bane> @Arqartur0 enrico pucci
[1:08:43] <+VeylmanTheRock> @Shishi1205 tried that multiple times I'm in blockstun and he grabs me out of the startup
[1:08:48] <+SnipeOrigin> yep go purple like pucci
[1:08:49] <%Shad0wTag> @RustyCoyoteA Trying to learn Ranger was a horrible idea and at least Hitman is easier to play but I can figure out a string for the life of me
[1:08:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Les go
[1:08:53] <+Shishi1205> @VeylmanTheRock what char?
[1:08:54] <+FoxLex_> Striker, Vanguard, and Zerker
[1:08:56] <+VeylmanTheRock> @odd_slater Vanguard
[1:09:02] <+thedream_c> Vanguard Confessionals :
[1:09:05] <Arqartur0> @WoolieVersus now we need a 40k fighting game
[1:09:22] <@Menitta> a 40k fighting game would be weird
[1:09:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[1:09:24] <+Shishi1205> @VeylmanTheRock uhm, down b?
[1:09:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I've been saying a Primarch fighting game could work
[1:09:29] <emptyantics> Lu Bu vs Martin Luther
[1:09:40] <TigerClaws12> Zerker is the only one who can abuse the baroque, wild character
[1:09:40] <Mirakei> The Berserker is too pagan and blasphemous for woolie
[1:09:41] <+RustyCoyoteA> @shad0wtag I can imagine considering how oppressive the melee characters can be, a ranged fighter would be hard to learn on the fly
[1:09:46] <%Irridium> i got my ass beat by some japanese player as berserker for a solid 30 minutes that character sure is something
[1:09:49] <skagtheprinceofhell> Beserker has sick combos and potential cause of his health drain mechanic gives more white health to work with.
[1:09:50] <Arqartur0> @Menitta Well, if you leave it in a thing, such as Necromunda, it would fit.
[1:09:52] <+thedream_c> the faith does not pursue
[1:09:54] <+thedream_c> they choose to change
[1:10:00] <slackerunchained> "Sister. I need your blood to... Oh. Wait a moment. You
[1:10:02] <xxHungryxx> good stuff 🤘
[1:10:03] <odd_slater> @veylmantherock From the outside looking in I feel like you might be able to lame him out with his normals but this is from someone that hasn't touched him lol
[1:10:05] <+Shishi1205> @TigerClaws12 Bro my first set was against a berserkers and I was getting super comboed into the abyss
[1:10:05] <+thedream_c> and do so with a wall and plus frames
[1:10:07] <@Menitta> I'd main Arbitrs
[1:10:09] <Blank9> wall hammer is hilarious
[1:10:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> More like Lu Bu vs Tancred of sicily
[1:10:12] <+VeylmanTheRock> @Shishi1205 you mean the low? that's way too slow, I'm talking outta blockstring, I can react jump to it but thats about it
[1:10:16] <its_uni__> good zerkers are crazy
[1:10:18] <santietch> @WoolieVersus how is the netcode?
[1:10:18] <@Menitta> Arbites*
[1:10:21] <%leith_aziz> All I ask from Arcsys (besides Guilty Gear stuff because im a fanboy pickyAYAYA ) is a JoJo fighter first and then im happy
[1:10:23] <critfumble_> GOD BLESS
[1:10:44] <Arqartur0> @leith_aziz the most recent one is great
[1:10:47] <+thedream_c> AMEN
[1:10:50] <NotHereToStream> accept jesus into your heart vanguard
[1:10:51] <TigerClaws12> that is just silly LUL
[1:10:51] <+VeylmanTheRock> @odd_slater I tried that too, he armors in with the red dash or times a guard dash
[1:10:53] <critfumble_> amen
[1:10:53] <+Shishi1205> @VeylmanTheRock down jab if thats your quickest attack then, but maybe thats the weakness of vanguard
[1:10:53] <Arqartur0> which was several years ago :(
[1:10:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> That wall is BS I love it
[1:10:58] <%leith_aziz> @leith_aziz JoJo you mean?
[1:11:04] <+Lonlana> daaaamn
[1:11:09] <+RustyCoyoteA> Yeah I’ve only had 1 match where I noticed the rollback occurring. Was still playable which was good
[1:11:11] <skagtheprinceofhell> The only bad lag match I had was when it was raining my end, everything else was pretty much 0 RB frames or like 2 at most and I'm on wifi cause my internet is satalite.
[1:11:12] <+VeylmanTheRock> @Shishi1205 yeah the down jab kick kinda whack
[1:11:20] <critfumble_> it is not your turn, it is not my turn, it is the lords turn before all others. amen
[1:11:22] <+Shishi1205> @VeylmanTheRock maybe foxlex knows more
[1:11:24] <xxHungryxx> Crusader: Build that wall ✝️
[1:11:30] <+thedream_c> My Faith in Plus frames is stronger than your faith in gapless pressure  :)
[1:11:32] <+VeylmanTheRock> yeah I'm peeping
[1:11:42] <+Akizea> I may just listen to the dfo ost today. the music in dfo is SO goddamn good. and the remixes in dnfd are really fucking good too
[1:11:50] <+Shishi1205> @skagtheprinceofhell I played vs people in Asia and had up to 8 rbf
[1:11:54] <+thedream_c> In a fighting game of believing, it will happen if your faith is absolute
[1:12:10] <NotHereToStream> that sweep
[1:12:11] <%leith_aziz> @Akizea Arcsys are good with that when it coems to adapting
[1:12:11] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Shishi1205 Been playing with Koreans and didn't have that.
[1:12:12] <+Chosington> sweep the leg
[1:12:13] <+Nobuwaroo> that was pretty sick
[1:12:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gotcha
[1:12:17] <emptyantics> Crusader listening to Zack Fox’s Jesus is the one
[1:12:18] <+squaresphere> Vanguard with the stick read
[1:12:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:12:19] <skagtheprinceofhell> China?
[1:12:19] <SebTheFuturist> Watch them toes
[1:12:21] <+Shishi1205> @skagtheprinceofhell EU here btw
[1:12:24] <%jinking79> respect the Neutral LUL
[1:12:25] <%leith_aziz> Woolie smiling is always a treat
[1:12:25] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:12:28] <Seithri> Oh man that sweep
[1:12:32] <+Akizea> @leith_aziz true true. this music sounds like it belongs in the og game pretty well
[1:12:33] <%leith_aziz> This man could cure my depression
[1:12:37] <+VeylmanTheRock> @Shishi1205 me too
[1:12:43] <Mirakei> Zia (from Bastion) as the Crusader: I dig your hole and build a wall
[1:12:54] <TigerClaws12> thicc normals
[1:12:57] <+RustyCoyoteA> Yeah vanguard has the reach that really lets you touch a player
[1:13:03] <slackerunchained> "While you practiced Relion, I dstudied the Blade."
[1:13:10] <+Shishi1205> yeah grappler grabbing your hitboxes is super weird too
[1:13:14] <skagtheprinceofhell> Might just be that, though I'm in fucking Hawaii but apparently my connection is better then usual cause I have a better connection with my friend in Minnosota then his hometown friends that live down the street from him
[1:13:14] <Archmortal> the key is to never let crusader press a button
[1:13:17] <xxHungryxx> Polearm Masters...
[1:13:19] <bv728> Keep in mind this is an 8ing joint with some ArcSys involvement, not a direct ArcSys game
[1:13:20] <Arqartur0> If Sepphiroth from ff7 was a a barbarian edgelord
[1:13:34] <+thedream_c> yeah 8ingis on the intro screen for a rason
[1:13:35] <+VeylmanTheRock> @Shishi1205 he legit grabbed my stick full range on whiff sajamNoise
[1:13:36] <shodoblanka1> do the crusader infinite
[1:13:41] <emptyantics> Lu Bu type beat
[1:13:42] <AstrodropGaming> Vanguard does not care for your prayers
[1:13:42] <%leith_aziz> @bv728 True, but that doesnt mean Arcsys HAVENT had an involvment
[1:13:46] <+thedream_c> so 8ings concepts are gonna be part of this game
[1:13:47] <@Solidus_113> were you saying yesterday Vanguard is kind of a lame character because a lot of his skill moves are kinda the same?
[1:13:49] <skagtheprinceofhell> @bv728 8ing being the people who do DNF Online specifically?
[1:13:53] <+Shishi1205> The conection is good anyways. Some hickups but as usual in far distances
[1:13:55] <Mirakei> @VeylmanTheRock I'm sure there's people who are into that
[1:13:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:14:00] <+Shishi1205> @VeylmanTheRock bro be grabbing my jump s
[1:14:01] <Blank9> it feels a lot more grounded than mvc3 or gg, I like that though
[1:14:02] <NotHereToStream> i don't recall whiff punishes in my bible study
[1:14:02] <BlackermanZX> huh so the new korean trailer showed a bit of unnanounced characters
[1:14:03] <TigerClaws12> Vanguard's DP do be wack tho
[1:14:07] <BlackermanZX> this roster is looking pretty fun
[1:14:10] <%leith_aziz> @skagtheprinceofhell No, that's Nexon I think
[1:14:17] <bv728> @skagtheprinceofhell No, that's Neople. 8ing are an independant company that does a mix of fighting games and shmups
[1:14:19] <skagtheprinceofhell> So what does 8ing do?
[1:14:26] <%leith_aziz> Marvel Vs Capcom 3
[1:14:28] <skagtheprinceofhell> Ah, those guys!
[1:14:28] <slackerunchained> Yeah Vanguard feels like its Crusader's natural 'rival', here...
[1:14:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Respect nothing
[1:14:32] <+thedream_c> 8ing did TvC
[1:14:38] <+thedream_c> they have FG experience
[1:14:40] <+thedream_c> big time
[1:14:40] <+VeylmanTheRock> what's the general consensus of the button names? A B S M?
[1:14:41] <+RustyCoyoteA> So does Crusader neutral MP have armor?
[1:14:42] <odd_slater> Bloody Roar and Naruto GNT too
[1:14:43] <%Irridium> why when searching for lobbies sometimes it shows 6 and sometimes it shows 1
[1:14:51] <Saltmeisterr> @thedream_c And marvel 3
[1:14:58] <pelonsinvalle> why does that pull
[1:15:01] <+Shishi1205> @Irridium bc this beta is trash
[1:15:07] <+squaresphere> don't forget "rolls"
[1:15:13] <slackerunchained> That's 1 for the Godless heathens, there...
[1:15:20] <+Shishi1205> the game is good the beta is almost borderline non functional
[1:15:22] <+thedream_c> we will for another day
[1:15:25] <skagtheprinceofhell> @Irridium Basically just a connection thing. What point you connect to any.
[1:15:27] <+thedream_c> when Crusader can get plus frames
[1:15:27] <+FoxLex_> what if dhalsim but fun
[1:15:30] <+Hacerous> maybe restricting his space
[1:15:32] <+VeylmanTheRock> have there been cases of eu playing with na?
[1:15:34] <skagtheprinceofhell> Did Woolie fight a Ranger yet?
[1:15:35] <+thedream_c> *pray for another day
[1:15:41] <BlackermanZX> yo that inquisitor color tho

[1:31:29] <skagtheprinceofhell> Remember children, Vanguard has more guard break on low health
[1:31:32] <Mirakei> Desk is gonna make some stupid ass combo videos in this game with the crusader setting up his wall for the opponent
[1:31:33] <+McSoliace> if you could put up two walls that would be nuts

[1:32:42] <+Shishi1205> @squaresphere 2B?
[1:32:51] <Guigondi> it must be so cathartic to throw crusader into his own cross
[1:33:05] <+thedream_c> i think its also because both chars play similar favorable ranges
[1:33:09] <+squaresphere> @Shishi1205 yeah, thanks!
[1:33:19] <+thedream_c> tho Vanguard pays off more playing that 'tipper' range
[1:33:22] <+Shishi1205> yeah buttons are A, B, S and MS
[1:33:34] <InternationalMienshaoCafe> @guigondi "screw you and your god"

[1:38:14] <+Shishi1205> Crusader gets 3 icons
[1:38:19] <+Nobuwaroo> zerker might benefit from going for more converts no?
[1:38:30] <InternationalMienshaoCafe> what is Nexon made a Maplestory fighting game?
[1:38:37] <Frampis> Crusader has 3 icons for the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit

[1:40:18] <filthymobileuser> crusaders air projectile is a war crime
[1:40:20] <+Shishi1205> worry more about the wall
[1:40:22] <David_de_Bergerac> woolie got the combos
[1:40:30] <GeltonZ> ...I'm only now realizing just how many classes in DFO are posessed by demons XD
[1:40:31] <+Shishi1205> @Shishi1205 he cant if he converts
[1:40:34] <skagtheprinceofhell> I kind of want them to let you sacrifice health for more conversion even at no white health at least once. But damn I know it be broken otherwise
[1:40:37] <MugenSandan> @trevin3dimensions no that's what Exorcist does
[1:40:43] <TigerClaws12> oh yea that's right herp

[1:49:16] <%Giothegame> Ah ok thanks
[1:49:17] <Thunderhog> @Aussie_Manny Grappler can chain his ground to air grab by charging it over and over. it scales terribly, but you can time out with it

[1:49:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> No woolie. God said no Elves

[1:50:53] <Guigondi> i HATE the supers in this game, they are SO unreliable!!!
[1:50:59] <Aussie_Manny> she do be schmovin
[1:50:59] <MugenSandan> the only thing Kunochi is missing is the shadow clones but to be fair that would be way too OP for this kind of game
[1:51:07] <therascalqueen> I keep wanting to play Inq because I love her style and buttons but I can only win with zerker so far
[1:51:11] <Shiibbae> boobies are temporary, leviticus is forever my children
[1:51:26] <xxHungryxx> geez
[1:51:26] <therascalqueen> Hoping Mechanic has that setplay that I crave
[1:51:32] <KaironFortressKnight> Hot Elf girls comes unto Woolie, but he has to go the midnight release of the bible.
[1:51:33] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:51:47] <+TheScorpionEater> who needs combos when you have DPs LUL
[1:51:51] <Aussie_Manny> Is Woolz on stick or pad?
[1:52:07] <Mirakei> Wake up honey new Bible just dropped
[1:52:15] <+Shishi1205> @Aussie_Manny pad
[1:52:19] <+Emperor_Z> Is something weird with the audio or is that just the sound of lava?
[1:52:22] <+Shishi1205> pad i enough for this game
[1:52:28] <+Shishi1205> @Emperor_Z bg sounds
[1:52:31] <odd_slater> I think he has to play pad on PS5 cause of the stick issue
[1:52:31] <KaironFortressKnight> @WoolieVersus Don't forget that this game has Alpha Counters.
[1:52:31] <DancesWitBalrog> Bible Patch 3.6 is out you guys
[1:52:39] <Shiibbae> that was a rlly nice confirm
[1:52:40] <Aussie_Manny> OHH THAT COMBO

[1:52:44] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> This stage is just loud af cause of the lava and the aircraft lol
[1:52:45] <+slayabee> Large SQUASH
[1:52:46] <Aussie_Manny> K.O.
[1:52:54] <Thunderhog> Every super in this game is "will it kill"
[1:52:56] <TenguGemini> ok wow so this game looks great
[1:52:56] <AstrodropGaming> Your hopes were answered
[1:53:04] <+marumariball> forward B + S, 100 meter
[1:53:05] <OkamiDude15> forward medium heavy while blocking
[1:53:07] <Omatherius> 6B+S costs 100 bar
[1:53:08] <Frampis> Block + forward + A + B
[1:53:16] <therascalqueen> I wish I could stay in servers a bit easier but the gameplay's top notch
[1:53:19] <TenguGemini> i was hoping the characters moved around decently fast and it looks like they do
[1:53:20] <DancesWitBalrog> JESUS CHRIST IS RIGHT, WOOLIE
[1:53:21] <TenguGemini> damn
[1:53:25] <KaironFortressKnight> @WoolieVersus Forward + Conversion while blocking. Takes 100MP
[1:53:35] <Thunderhog> or to make it easier Forward conversion in block
[1:53:41] <+thedream_c> nice bird, but I believed in the LORD

[1:54:29] <Thunderhog> everyone be forgetting about the guard button
[1:54:31] <TrickModeX> ahhh
[1:54:45] <%JetpackMcQuack> fire tornados are cool
[1:54:55] <Aussie_Manny> All we have is the controls mapping screen. We gotta figure this shit out ourselves. khadNoted
[1:54:57] <bigshedman> Not as cool as the LORD PogChamp
[1:55:02] <Omatherius> Once Kunoichi and Zerker players get their hands on training mode its all over I swear.
[1:55:17] <therascalqueen> people have posted command lists, it's not like they're long
[1:55:17] <DancesWitBalrog> Aganos wall??

[1:56:28] <DancesWitBalrog> every character in this game looks hella cool
[1:56:31] <+TheScorpionEater> I wonder what the cost is gonna be
[1:56:39] <odd_slater> It's cute watching the avatars line up lmao
[1:56:42] <Aussie_Manny> Yeeeeh, let's go, Striker! 2020Forward
[1:56:42] <BackflipCharm> The black color is super rad

[1:57:01] <xxHungryxx> No Grappler players...
[1:57:03] <VioletBeat> ggs the hammer is so scary

[1:57:56] <Aussie_Manny> low
[1:58:04] <Guigondi> hell yeah!! Striker!!!
[1:58:12] <Thunderhog> Striker is deceptively safe on block
[1:58:18] <+squaresphere> don't forget about your counter
[1:58:20] <+TheScorpionEater> i forgot that throws can be more than 1f after so much strive LUL
[1:58:45] <LordOfThePoultry> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:58:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:58:47] <%Fetrigon> this it?
[1:58:48] <+TheScorpionEater> yo that was sick
[1:58:50] <therascalqueen> Striker is really heavy on chip actually bc of long safe strings and her passive boosting chip
[1:58:52] <%JetpackMcQuack> MORE
[1:58:52] <%Fetrigon> ye ok
[1:58:53] <Guigondi> i like Genki Martial art girl!!!
[1:58:56] <Aussie_Manny> ooohhhh now THAT'S a long combo
[1:59:01] <TigerClaws12> she has reverse beats, ofc she's safe on blocks LUL
[1:59:02] <Aussie_Manny> longest combo i've seen yet
[1:59:08] <therascalqueen> I've seen Strikers just oppress with long strings and then cash in a ton of white health with one hit
[1:59:12] <Civet10> actually does this game have chip kills?
[1:59:21] <Omatherius> No chip kills
[1:59:24] <therascalqueen> I don't think you can be chip killed, no
[1:59:40] <%Moonblade92> "wooooow Jesus Christ" really hits different on Crusader Woolie
[2:00:24] <Guigondi> Jesus Christ? mor like Jesus Strike
[2:00:40] <MugenSandan> Or would it be
[2:00:43] <+Eijiken> A can always convert into Aegis, then A > A > Buff
[2:00:43] <+Tennochief> I really hope Avenger can get in
[2:00:45] <therascalqueen> Striker's Conversion strings are disgusting
[2:00:45] <%Fetrigon> is it my turn yet? woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:00:46] <DarknessHS> and still have mp
[2:00:47] <+squaresphere> @Guigondi LOL
[2:00:47] <%Calenrow> she punch
[2:00:47] <MugenSandan> Jesus Fight
[2:00:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> she's here to strike
[2:00:51] <TrickModeX> I have one answer to striker. The wheel.
[2:00:52] <Aussie_Manny> If there was a "customize colour palette" option in the game, that'd be the raddest shit. lytSHADES
[2:01:04] <Shiibbae> striker is the definition of "throw hands"
[2:01:10] <Frampis> Striker is the protagonist of this game and you can't convince me otherwise
[2:01:23] <TheBadonkulator> you get bonus damage if you scream "JESUS" into the microphone
[2:01:28] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I love sticker so much lmao
[2:01:30] <%Fetrigon> nice
[2:01:32] <+squaresphere> nice exchanges
[2:01:35] <GeltonZ> @Shiibbae Isla: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?!
[2:01:36] <%Shad0wTag> @TheBadonkulator catholic profanity bonus
[2:01:39] <Aussie_Manny> I never really thought about who the "protagonist" is... Chat, who is the shoto of this game?
[2:01:41] <JoviLovesYou> Damn good throw
[2:01:45] <Arqartur0> @WoolieVersus which is better: Custom Colors, or extra skins?
[2:01:49] <+BackwardCap> Berserker is on the front screen, Striker not even on any sub menu
[2:01:50] <Aussie_Manny> Does this game even HAVE a shoto?
[2:01:50] <Shiibbae> LMAO TRU
[2:01:52] <+Tennochief> @Frampis you just wait until Mom (Sword MAster) gets in here
[2:02:02] <slackerunchained> @Aussie_Manny It'd be scant nanoseconds before Woolie applied an Evangelion palette to Crusader, here.
[2:02:02] <Guigondi> crusader be hammering and nail people on the cross like a Roman executer here
[2:02:10] <GeltonZ> @Aussie_Manny Female Fighter is a Shoto in the MMO so kinda Striker sorta.
[2:02:12] <ultimntpenguin> Striker's low profile slide is the dirtiest normal in the game
[2:02:13] <Shiibbae> @Aussie_Manny its the vanguard, the staff dude
[2:02:17] <Frampis> I wonder if the final game will have English voices? I wanna hear Crusader in English
[2:02:23] <%Moonblade92> we got no one that fits the shoto. Crysader maybe if he wasn't Big Body.
[2:02:25] <JoviLovesYou> Yo we gettin stands in here with Ghostblade comin out though.
[2:02:27] <Guigondi> like, wich side is he on?? XD
[2:02:32] <slackerunchained> "Stop! Stop! He's already deeeeeeaaaad~!"
[2:02:32] <BlackermanZX> Berserker and Inquisitor are kinda the poster characters
[2:02:38] <+Akizea> man she just gets to GO lol
[2:02:39] <%Fetrigon> oof woolieOMG
[2:02:42] <therascalqueen> I'm looking forward to Mechanic, the turret setplay should be gross hopefully
[2:02:43] <BackflipCharm> When I first saw that crazy crusader wall combo I thought it'd be busted. But it feels like if you get hit with that mess it'syour own fault
[2:02:45] <Shiibbae> NOOOOOOO
[2:02:46] <Onorekian> stay hydrated
[2:02:48] <+Eijiken> @WoolieVersus If you land an A from any range, it will always combo into aegis>A>A>Buff.  I too am a man of god with 22 win streak
[2:02:48] <@Menitta> huh there really is no one that fits shot
[2:02:48] <+Tennochief> LUL
[2:02:48] <+slayabee> NOOOOO

[2:03:10] <Civet10> i heard if you get that error you can just let the oppoment win and it doesnt boot you to menu
[2:03:10] <bigshedman> Time for Jesus is over :(
[2:03:13] <+TheScorpionEater> your not allowed to like zerker if you think ragna is wack

[2:03:28] <+Shishi1205> @Civet10 kinda I did it once
[2:03:30] <+Eijiken> Aegis alwas wall bounces when it hits
[2:03:31] <TheBadonkulator> the power of Christ turns up the sweat
[2:03:37] <slackerunchained> Woolie needs to air himself.
[2:03:39] <@Menitta> just got back home. I wanna try again for a match
[2:03:40] <%Shad0wTag> Any reason why you have stage set to Zelva?
[2:03:42] <TigerClaws12> @WoolieVersus you not hit X or O and it'll disappear on the win screen
[2:03:43] <Guigondi> @slayabee gotta study those tapes
[2:03:44] <+BackwardCap> Ragna is a whack version of Berserker.
[2:04:12] <Frampis> Why is it called DNF?
[2:04:16] <Frampis> DuNgeon Fighter?
[2:04:19] <+Tennochief> Berserker and Male Slayer take a lot of inspiration from Sol Badguy actually
[2:04:24] <%SaurianCrash> Dungeon n Fighter
[2:04:30] <MugenSandan> Dungeon And Fighter
[2:04:30] <Aussie_Manny> Fungeon Dighters
[2:04:34] <BlackermanZX> gawddamn i hope they add Dragoon at some point
[2:04:43] <+Tennochief> @Frampis It's Dungeon And Fighter, it's the main name of the game
[2:04:44] <Civet10> the error pop up
[2:04:45] <gyrobasel> @Frampis its called dungeon and fighter in east asia
[2:04:45] <OkamiDude15> when the disconnect notif appears mid screen
[2:04:46] <TigerClaws12> @WoolieVersus the error popup
[2:04:46] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus If you get the rror mid battle
[2:04:50] <Anthrozzz> woolsworth needs a comeback
[2:04:53] <fIashman92> If you die at the disconnect screen, it resets at the rematch screen
[2:04:56] <ultimntpenguin> Let that error message stay until the match ends
[2:05:01] <+Tennochief> don't play DFO on Steam btw, it sucks ass
[2:05:02] <+Shishi1205> yeah
[2:05:03] <Frampis> Duke Nukem Forever Duel
[2:05:04] <OkamiDude15> yea

[2:05:07] <+Shishi1205> press B
[2:05:10] <+BackwardCap> The error message that appears isn't a real disconnect
[2:05:10] <%SaurianCrash> I kinda want Knight and Female Slayer
[2:05:16] <BlackermanZX> error popup. if you the opponent is still active he can kill you and it goes away @WoolieVersus
[2:05:17] <Frampis> @Tennochief k what's the correct version to play?
[2:05:17] <FreedomARX7> Max just let them win
[2:05:17] <TigerClaws12> yea just let the other person beat you LUL
[2:05:22] <gyrobasel> Dungeon Fighter Online is its name in the west
[2:05:24] <Aussie_Manny> Oh right, that popup error you just got in that match, if you DON'T press X, the rounds will end, and on the Results screen, you can Retry and get back into it.
[2:05:33] <+SilverInferno3> Wait if it isn't a real disconnect, then what is it?
[2:05:34] <%Shad0wTag> Yo Woolz whats your search settings?
[2:05:34] <+Shishi1205> X or O
[2:05:35] <bigshedman> Take that L for the reconnect!
[2:05:36] <Guigondi> If you don't press X or circle there is a chance you won't be booted out
[2:05:36] <TigerClaws12> beta Kappa
[2:05:40] <Aussie_Manny> It is a FAKE error!

[2:05:52] <Anthrozzz> i  cant wait for you to play elden ring, are you gonna play with pat?
[2:05:53] <+Tennochief> @Frampis just play straight from the Neopole site, although the game isn't that good, lots of grind and Fatigue Points
[2:05:54] <TheBadonkulator> does Inquisitor have a Spanish skin?
[2:05:54] <+FoxLex_> I'll be on later, gotta shower
[2:05:59] <+BackwardCap> @silverinferno3 Probably a bug from the game dysyncing momentarily
[2:06:02] <+Tennochief> Charctaers and art are amazing though
[2:06:15] <Hammatime8> The tiny crucifix in crusar's huge hands is funny to me
[2:06:16] <+Shishi1205> this map is trash

[2:06:26] <+Shishi1205> hear the BG noise? stfu volcano
[2:06:29] <KaironFortressKnight> eeeehhhh this is better than that comparison

[2:06:31] <TigerClaws12> you really just gonna do BlazBlue like that? LUL
[2:06:32] <critfumble_> AMEN
[2:06:34] <gyrobasel> these games are actually good and have enough meat to them unlike korra and TMNT
[2:06:35] <%Shad0wTag> I think Woolie has it set to this stage on accident maybe?
[2:06:36] <Frampis> I wonder how much they will charge for this game
[2:06:39] <Idon__> That's not a very flattering comparison LUL
[2:06:39] <MugenSandan> I just hope this game is a sign that DFO's big visual update actually happens soon
[2:06:40] <ultimntpenguin> Damn footsies fr

[2:09:22] <+Tragosavich> If I convert do I get a cool color pallet?
[2:09:26] <@Menitta> I'm tryin
[2:09:42] <%Shad0wTag> I'm assuming its full or something
[2:09:45] <Aussie_Manny> THE CROSS UP
[2:09:46] <Anthrozzz> the crusader woolie is playing as looks like hoinhiem of light from FMA brotherhood
[2:09:47] <kinkade_77> bible would be cooler if it had fights like these
[2:09:48] <critfumble_> ONLY THE LORD IS PERFECT
[2:09:48] <roz_en> @Aussie_Manny Satan - " You're only minus if your a bitch"
[2:09:48] <%Shad0wTag> I guess we'll see after the set
[2:09:50] <Aussie_Manny> get it... cross... hehe
[2:09:51] <+Superbro64> is that a cross up if they dont hold the block button?
[2:10:02] <OkamiDude15> yup
[2:10:03] <+Shishi1205> @Shad0wTag if its full then it doesnt appear
[2:10:12] <Guigondi> at this point i just feel bad for anyone who has to deal with crusader
[2:10:16] <@Menitta> Died on the Crossup
[2:10:17] <BlackermanZX> does crusader actually have a cross up lmao
[2:10:24] <%Shad0wTag> @Shad0wTag It does help you can only search 3 rooms at a time
[2:10:25] <sexycars420> will the character's get real names or remain archetypes?
[2:10:36] <%notsoy> it looks like most normals cause air flip out?
[2:10:42] <MugenSandan> They're probably gonna stay archetypes
[2:10:43] <+Tennochief> @sexycars420 none of the characters have real names, just their subclass names
[2:10:48] <OkamiDude15> prob remain archetypes since  its just like that
[2:10:52] <+Superbro64> @blackermanzx if you roll through somone while the holy light is on them, maybe
[2:10:58] <+Tennochief> closest you can get to names, is the 2nd Awakening titles
[2:11:04] <+Superbro64> depends if this game has crossup protection or not
[2:11:06] <@Menitta> lmao
[2:11:08] <sexycars420> @Tennochief is it known if they will get real names in the finished game or not?
[2:11:10] <+Shishi1205> go to another
[2:11:26] <Aussie_Manny> Ruth 3:9 - "Entrust in thine zoning abilities, and no evil shall cross thine up."
[2:11:31] <+breakersnap> wheres regi? PoroSad
[2:11:43] <+transporterthesequel> Probably archetypes, but DFO also has a ton of named characters that 8'ing can use if they want.
[2:11:45] <+Tennochief> @sexycars420 no, none of them have names periods. All these characters are subclasses/specializations
[2:11:46] <sexycars420> regi is practicing for genesis
[2:11:54] <bigshedman> Though I walk through the valley of loser's bracket, I shall fear no scrubs.
[2:11:54] <Coolest_Joke> hows the DNF been Woolie?
[2:12:05] <Aussie_Manny> Charging Christ
[2:12:06] <roz_en> Striker doesn't have the nuetral presence of other characters, but fuck if she isn't scary in the corner
[2:12:09] <JoviLovesYou> My name is Seria Kirmin.
[2:12:11] <+transporterthesequel> In other words, G.S.D or riot 8'ing
[2:12:29] <+MyooMyoo> @sexycars420 the names their using are the classes names it’s based off an MMO so you end up naming the characters
[2:12:31] <@Menitta> I can't unsee 8ing 8ong now
[2:12:33] <+Superbro64> I think its the gunner's mechanic classes, but the male 3rd awakening is called "Optimus", while the female 3rd awakening is called "Prime"
[2:12:37] <Jetsfantasy> That carry tho
[2:12:40] <Aussie_Manny> SHE GOT STRINGSSS
[2:12:52] <OkamiDude15> optimum pride PogChamp
[2:12:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:12:58] <sexycars420> @MyooMyoo gotcha thank you it makes sense now
[2:12:59] <roz_en> OKAY, this dude hasn't stopped playing since he got into a lobby, goddamn those strings
[2:12:59] <Aussie_Manny> Daaaamn, Woolie got read like a bible in Alabama.
[2:13:06] <+Tennochief> @Superbro64 that is correct
[2:13:22] <@Menitta> how people find the room so quickly is beyond me lmao
[2:13:27] <+Superbro64> if they try to junp your throw attempt, remember they cant block, react with an aa possibly? @woolieversus
[2:13:28] <Coolest_Joke> Nice
[2:13:30] <MugenSandan> I just want my God Hand ;-;
[2:13:31] <sexycars420> gotta make them guess
[2:13:38] <Guigondi> go go striker , you play well
[2:13:38] <+thedream_c> the wall is a signal for the coming of the LORD
[2:13:41] <+breakersnap> no one in alabama has read the bible
[2:13:44] <darkodargon> SEND THEM TO JESUS WOOLZ
[2:13:46] <+thedream_c> u must repent, or face the holiness
[2:13:46] <Frampis> The shield affects his attacks?
[2:13:52] <Guigondi> @MugenSandan you and me both ;_;
[2:13:52] <OkamiDude15> ye
[2:13:54] <Aussie_Manny> It's the Wall of Jericho.
[2:13:59] <$ggbhtg> @menitta home court advantage i guess
[2:14:17] <sexycars420> good tech
[2:14:24] <+Superbro64> We are all good holy boys and girls on this fine Sunday evening 🙏
[2:14:24] <+MyooMyoo> @sexycars420 no prob homie
[2:14:29] <Aussie_Manny> she just won't stop STRIKING
[2:14:31] <DSD24> Ooooo is Woolie liking Crusader?
[2:14:38] <Aussie_Manny> ONE PUUUUNCH
[2:14:39] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> STRIKE, you're out
[2:14:42] <%Shad0wTag> @DSD24 The lord's Crusader
[2:14:49] <MidnightPacif1c> she punch
[2:14:50] <DSD24> Crusader has the good shit
[2:14:51] <Guigondi> Strike for the win!
[2:14:51] <BlackermanZX> we got a real one
[2:14:52] <sexycars420> does Striker have a boob belt?
[2:14:57] <+Tennochief> I've been enditing the DRO wiki to add the lore seections for each of the Neo Awakenings. The wiki has suprisingly been lacking on a lot fo them, despite eing translated for months
[2:14:59] <DedlokPM> @Frampis earlier it looked like the bubble gives him Armor. Big wall just acts like a wall
[2:15:05] <ElPlasa> @sexycars420 Of course
[2:15:10] <DSD24> Yoooo
[2:15:12] <roz_en> @sexycars420 No, but she has camel boob
[2:15:17] <DSD24> Is that new tech!?
[2:15:19] <+SilverInferno3> @sexycars420 It looks like it's a part of her top
[2:15:19] <bigshedman> Does crusader strike a fucking cross before he throws yoi?!
[2:15:21] <+UnfilteredComic> thats so silly
[2:15:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ElPlasa
[2:15:23] <Aussie_Manny> Chat, is there a true boxer in Dungeon Fighter Online, or is it Striker?
[2:15:28] <slackerunchained> Is that the Tower of Babel in the background?
[2:15:30] <MugenSandan> Monk
[2:15:30] <TacoBomber> OPTIMAL
[2:15:38] <+Tennochief> @Aussie_Manny female Striker and Monk
[2:15:39] <MugenSandan> the boxer of GOD
[2:15:44] <DSD24> I don't know shit about Crusaders gameplan other then the Wall
[2:15:44] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> Striker combos feel so good
[2:15:45] <+UnfilteredComic> @Aussie_Manny Monk is probably the closest
[2:15:45] <DedlokPM> @Aussie_Manny striker's default weapon is boxing gloves
[2:15:47] <+transporterthesequel> Monk is indeed the true Boxer
[2:15:47] <sexycars420> anime loves bras on the outside of the outfit
[2:15:50] <Aussie_Manny> Monk, ey? 🤔
[2:15:56] <sexycars420> RIP

[2:16:15] <ElPlasa> no?
[2:16:16] <yayohawk> azteReally azteReally
[2:16:18] <TigerClaws12> nooooo
[2:16:20] <Guigondi> Top buttons ok
[2:16:20] <+McSoliace> nope
[2:16:21] <slackerunchained> IT'S FIIIIINE...
[2:16:21] <%Sparkseid> hmmmm
[2:16:21] <Thunderhog> as long as it wasnt O or X you could play it out
[2:16:22] <@Menitta> damn
[2:16:22] <Afrosamasenpai> YES
[2:16:23] <Thunderhog> but oh well
[2:16:24] <Hammatime8> Oh, real disconnect
[2:16:24] <Onorekian> F
[2:16:24] <bigshedman> Didn't believe hard enough, Woolie.
[2:16:25] <Aussie_Manny> Oh no, looks like this was a legit error.
[2:16:26] <sexycars420> not working
[2:16:27] <Afrosamasenpai> THEY OKA- oh it broke
[2:16:28] <Aussie_Manny> NVM.
[2:16:29] <Jediforce317> i got disconectes too @woolieversus
[2:16:30] <+Akizea> ah thats a real disconnect
[2:16:30] <karismaticprik> PogBones
[2:16:31] <+SilverInferno3> It looks like a true disconnect this time
[2:16:32] <Thunderhog> ok actuall DC
[2:16:33] <DSD24> Aww
[2:16:35] <KaironFortressKnight> @aussie_manny Monk is a boxer, he has a bunch of Dudley-like moves
[2:16:36] <TigerClaws12> ok that was real
[2:16:37] <Guigondi> SOMETIMES it works
[2:16:37] <+Shishi1205> triangle or square should work, damn
[2:16:38] <+McSoliace> thats a real disconnect then
[2:16:38] <+eanscrale> It's a good thing this stuff is being tested out
[2:16:40] <+Superbro64> they probably got the error on their end too
[2:16:43] <Afrosamasenpai> Top buttons should work though
[2:16:45] <OkamiDude15> they used a skill so it confirmed the disconnect
[2:16:50] <+MyooMyoo> @tennochief yo you are so dope for doing that your very right compared to Elwiki it’s very lack luster
[2:16:50] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:16:52] <TigerClaws12> YE YE YE
[2:16:54] <$ggbhtg> you can still use macros @woolieversus
[2:16:54] <%Sparkseid> Lol
[2:16:54] <BlackermanZX> oh it actually disconnected
[2:16:56] <Aussie_Manny> @KaironFortressKnight Ooohh, that's what I like to hear. 🥊
[2:16:56] <Thunderhog> OH BOY
[2:16:56] <DSD24> Crusader has so many fun moves
[2:16:58] <%JetpackMcQuack> cursed room
[2:16:58] <TigerClaws12> YEEEEEEEEE
[2:16:59] <+Shishi1205> LUL
[2:17:02] <Onorekian> yeyeyeye
[2:17:02] <MugenSandan> god what if Monk actually has its Shadow Clone buff in this game I'll fucking die of laughter
[2:17:02] <Afrosamasenpai> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:17:03] <+Yc_Black> it didnt work because the game froze
[2:17:03] <Darlos9D> I'm having a bunch of issues all of a sudden
[2:17:05] <Aussie_Manny> Let's fight Matt
[2:17:07] <ElPlasa> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:17:08] <Shardlab> Invisible menus
[2:17:16] <@Menitta> oh my god
[2:17:19] <+Shishi1205> thank god
[2:17:21] <Shardlab> Phantom room participants
[2:17:24] <Coolest_Joke> sweet
[2:17:25] <Dopamien> will this be out on PC when it officially releases?
[2:17:25] <+Tennochief> @MyooMyoo lol, thank you. It's been a lot of work. I've only got everyhting after Female Mage to do
[2:17:26] <+slayabee> Always with the QA shit
[2:17:26] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> lmao
[2:17:30] <TigerClaws12> thou shall not escape QA hell
[2:17:31] <Guigondi> QA ghost
[2:17:31] <Nitsuj293> They are going to have to fiiiiix some stuff
[2:17:31] <BlackermanZX> the ghost of QA
[2:17:32] <Onorekian> QA brain
[2:17:32] <+Superbro64> for a network test beta, its funny how they arent testing a basic "ranked search" feature or something @woolieversus
[2:17:45] <$ggbhtg> you can still use macros, anything except x and o @woolieversus
[2:17:55] <@Menitta> SFV did that iirc
[2:17:59] <+Tennochief> @MyooMyoo oddly enough, the newer classes have had their lore added, but the older ones haven't
[2:18:01] <%Plus_On_Black> talk that talk
[2:18:03] <sexycars420> any known jank ?
[2:18:04] <roz_en> theres not point to it
[2:18:05] <@Menitta> no date
[2:18:05] <DSD24> Summer 2022
[2:18:06] <@Solidus_113> Summer 2022
[2:18:07] <+McSoliace> summer
[2:18:07] <+Akizea> summer 2022

[2:18:09] <%JustToWatch> summer 2022
[2:18:09] <+Superbro64> Summer 2022
[2:18:09] <+Akizea> so like 6 months
[2:18:10] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> Beta's don't get tested that thoroughly
[2:18:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> summer
[2:18:15] <GeltonZ> Friendly reminder that 8ing is running a College Work Study program.
[2:18:21] <@Solidus_113> probably July
[2:18:23] <+slayabee> 6-8 months
[2:18:25] <NotHereToStream> hopefully there will be another beta before release
[2:18:25] <+Superbro64> They soft announced 3 new characters today
[2:18:27] <Shardlab> SFV was an early access Tournament edition that should have released as such
[2:18:29] <MugenSandan> or right now if you wanna play DFO itself psaGoblin
[2:18:34] <+MyooMyoo> @tennochief work is cut out for you but I’ll be reading all you have to upload
[2:18:38] <GeltonZ> VERY possibly!
[2:18:39] <roz_en> seems to have been way more stable than Strives beta though
[2:18:39] <DSD24> I wonder if this is gonna be a full release or a free to play thing like Max theorized
[2:18:44] <sexycars420> gross interns
[2:18:55] <Aussie_Manny> Interns are making this game?! Holy shit, they are doing good work.
[2:19:01] <+Akizea> @DSD24 this being free to play on launch would be sick honestly
[2:19:05] <Arqartur0> Well, those interns deserve PAYMENT
[2:19:05] <+Tennochief> @MyooMyoo thanks, I'll try to finish them later tonight
[2:19:06] <TheBadonkulator> "Yeah for my dissertation I weaponised Christianity for this streamer one time"
[2:19:06] <@Menitta> YES I GOT IN
[2:19:08] <%Plus_On_Black> @superbro64 Whoms the three, Money?
[2:19:12] <GeltonZ> @Aussie_Manny Part interns, part Bloody Roar team.
[2:19:12] <%Shad0wTag> I feel like if this was F2P we wouldn't have this many characters at launch
[2:19:14] <DSD24> That's a cute Striker color
[2:19:19] <aka_Jigawatt> Nahr toe
[2:19:23] <Aussie_Manny> Ayyy, my favourite Striker colours! pocket73Pog
[2:19:30] <+Superbro64> Arcsys is fully leaving this to Neople / Nexon to do PR, much how they left Cygames to do announcements for GBVS I guess
[2:19:31] <%Shad0wTag> @Menitta Good luck dude!
[2:19:33] <DSD24> Tan Striker lets goooo!
[2:19:36] <+Akizea> @Shad0wTag how many characters did KI have on launch again?
[2:19:41] <whimwhisp> I like her default orange honestly.
[2:19:43] <+MyooMyoo> Idk if it’ll be free to play there’s so much polish on the character models
[2:19:50] <DSD24> @whimwhisp Oh her default is amazing
[2:19:52] <TigerClaws12> god damnit LUL
[2:19:53] <critfumble_> BOP
[2:19:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:19:54] <@Menitta> that's a good striker color
[2:19:56] <TigerClaws12> BOP
[2:20:01] <Aussie_Manny> BOP BOP BOP
[2:20:02] <DSD24> Oh my god this Crusader tech
[2:20:02] <critfumble_> BOP AMEN BOP
[2:20:02] <roz_en> @Shad0wTag 6-8
[2:20:05] <sexycars420> this white color striker is nice
[2:20:09] <+Tennochief> one of the Striker colors looks a lot like Millia Rage
[2:20:09] <GeltonZ> It'll only be Free to Play if they manage to get avatar parts in the game.
[2:20:10] <Guigondi> oof
[2:20:13] <Aussie_Manny> BOP AMEN BOP AMEN BOP AMEN
[2:20:16] <Frampis> This game has 6 buttons right? Including Guard
[2:20:16] <+Superbro64> @plus_on_black Ghost Blade (M. Slayer), Mechanic (F. Gunner), Troubleshooter (Agent)
[2:20:18] <DSD24> I have been missing out on the multi hammer shit
[2:20:19] <%Shad0wTag> @Shad0wTag 5 or 6 not including Fulgore or Spinal
[2:20:22] <Onorekian> white hair dark skin supremacy
[2:20:25] <Nitsuj293> Hammmmmer
[2:20:30] <Aussie_Manny> A! A! A! AAAMEN!
[2:20:35] <+MyooMyoo> ^^^
[2:20:36] <%SaurianCrash> @sexycars420 i use that one most V:
[2:20:37] <@Menitta> 6 buttons including guard and Super
[2:20:40] <critfumble_> BOP AMEN BOP
[2:20:43] <@Menitta> I think
[2:20:47] <spiralpsyche> jeez that hammer
[2:20:48] <WzillNJ> crusader seems like a fair character
[2:20:48] <DSD24> @Onorekian Its good Kunoichi has the same look in her alt colors too
[2:20:50] <+SweetBeanAmin> Praise allah
[2:20:56] <sexycars420> woolie loves his walk up
[2:20:56] <TacoBomber> god that combo is so dumb I love it
[2:20:58] <+Superbro64> There still is no F. Slayer, F. Mage, or M. Mage subclasses yet, so this game could have 15-16 characters at launch
[2:20:59] <DSD24> Yooooo the Spear Throw!
[2:21:00] <+Tennochief> Troubleshooter is just fucking Dante with COyote-A
[2:21:04] <@Menitta> Oh wow divekick into skill
[2:21:06] <kressywastaken> So has woolie given his consensus on the game? He like it?
[2:21:11] <Engelbrekt87> Repent! Repent! Repent! (repeat)
[2:21:13] <%notsoy> i hope those hammer loops against the cross get the "ay ay ay" treatment from the crowd
[2:21:13] <%Plus_On_Black> @superbro64 waiting for Slayer
[2:21:20] <Frampis> Damn it would be so fun if you could M or F for any character
[2:21:21] <Guigondi> "i need some corner mix ups" - said the man who just won with a double perfect. LUL LUL LUL
[2:21:26] <roz_en> This game feels like Marvel but less hyper movement
[2:21:32] <%Shad0wTag> @notsoy Or better yet ON GOD, ON GOD, ON GOD, ON GOD
[2:21:39] <DSD24> Literal Cross Ups
[2:21:40] <critfumble_> BOP AMEN BOP
[2:21:48] <+UnfilteredComic> Does Chip kill in this game
[2:21:49] <Frampis> lol cross up
[2:21:52] <Anthrozzz> uber cool
[2:21:52] <+Superbro64> @plus_on_black curious if they WILL include the base classes, it seems to be subclasses for now, no 2nd / 3rd / neo awakenings either
[2:21:55] <%notsoy> nah, just "ay ay ay amen" is simpler and works better
[2:22:01] <Aussie_Manny> Somebody's getting JUUUDGED~! Somebody's getting juuudged~!
[2:22:06] <+Tennochief> @Frampis that actually wouldn't work. Despite being male and female versions of each other, their classes and gameplay are totally seperate and distinct from one another
[2:22:11] <Shardlab> @UnfilteredComic Not from what I've seen, but you can get guard broken
[2:22:13] <Anthrozzz> woolie just giving the buisness
[2:22:16] <DSD24> @UnfilteredComic I don't think it does
[2:22:18] <%Shad0wTag> @notsoy You right there
[2:22:22] <critfumble_> BOP AMEN BOP
[2:22:23] <sexycars420> wow that is insane corner pressure
[2:22:27] <bigshedman> SQueeeeze that heathen!
[2:22:28] <+MyooMyoo> @superbro64 I believe they are doing all the first awakenings givin they showed Ghost blade and trouble shooter
[2:22:29] <+Superbro64> 60 subclasses * 3 awakenings = easily 180 DFO classes or so total
[2:22:30] <%Shad0wTag> Menitta about to use THE WHEEL
[2:22:33] <+Tennochief> also, the new Male Gunner subclass is fucking Iron Man
[2:22:33] <TigerClaws12> AMEN BOP
[2:22:40] <Aussie_Manny> Menitta is in
[2:22:44] <DSD24> and you need the micro walk too right Woolie?
[2:22:46] <+Shishi1205> @woolieversus check what hifight retired for some inspiration
[2:22:48] <Shardlab> I wonder how much of this is gonna stay the same
[2:22:52] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus how many times u done that loop tonight? LUL
[2:22:56] <+Tennochief> and Neo Vanguard is straight up Lu Bu
[2:22:56] <+ArmoredAnathema> bonkbonkbonkbonkbonk BOP
[2:22:58] <DSD24> Hitman Swag
[2:23:02] <TigerClaws12> time to get bonked
[2:23:03] <Aussie_Manny> Is Menitta a long-time mod here?
[2:23:03] <+thedream_c> hitmaynes come for the tithe money
[2:23:03] <%Shad0wTag> OH NO WHEEL?
[2:23:03] <+Shishi1205> retweeted
[2:23:10] <RedCycloneInc> You can also use the wall's bhockwave mid combo to bounce them too

[2:23:23] <+Superbro64> @myoomyoo Max thought of other awakenings people alt costumes, which is cute I guess. Not sure if Arcsys' art team is up for it though

[2:23:46] <Deko_> bruh the damage
[2:23:47] <+alphonseisbest> he looks like a well grown Rean from cold steel
[2:23:52] <%SaurianCrash> its Old Kirito

[2:24:47] <+Tennochief> in fact, there's even a Vergil mod for Agent
[2:24:48] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> Does he say "Sorry, Boss" when you use super?
[2:24:49] <morkelebmink> deus vult
[2:24:52] <OkamiDude15> which language is the game lip synced to?

[2:28:01] <DSD24> I got my ass kicked by a Vanguard
[2:28:06] <DSD24> His range
[2:28:07] <+Superbro64> If you want to see optimal Crusader play, a dude by the name of ThatGuy went like 70-16 on SonicSol the other day
[2:28:10] <+Superbro64> it was wild
[2:28:15] <+thedream_c> Vanguard is a fame char def
[2:28:15] <+ArmoredAnathema> DO NOT PURSUE
[2:28:15] <sexycars420> is vanguard the mc?
[2:28:16] <@Menitta> the answer to Crusader is Gunslinger or Vanguard lmao
[2:28:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> yo that goldlewis faust clip below it
[2:28:23] <+thedream_c> Fame loves his is neutral and solid range buttons
[2:28:25] <+fizzguy47> the netcode is pretty good

[2:29:04] <+hush_wolf> faith=unshaken

[2:29:06] <JoviLovesYou> We take th;ose.
[2:29:11] <%Shad0wTag> Demonic Lance fear install
[2:29:13] <Aussie_Manny> you lame grabbing mf LUL
[2:29:20] <+Tennochief> I just relaized something
[2:29:26] <DSD24> Crusader is totally doing Zealous Accusation
[2:29:26] <Aussie_Manny> the RAAANGE
[2:29:34] <BigGayZai> @Aussie_Manny grabs are the true chad strat
[2:29:37] <Anthrozzz> Scary throw mix-up woolie
[2:29:40] <Aussie_Manny> A taste of your own medicine, doctor?
[2:29:40] <sexycars420> mad cause grabbed
[2:29:41] <+Tennochief> Vanguard's awakening fromat has him tunr into Zoro and then evolve into Lu Bu
[2:29:45] <Thunderhog> oh i havent seen vanguard air conversions
[2:29:45] <BlackermanZX> damn vanguard is actually scary
[2:30:06] <sexycars420> armor make brain go brrr
[2:30:14] <+Superbro64> vanguard's giant normals is contrasted by their tiny super hitbox
[2:30:19] <@Menitta> God Hitman was so fun. I can't wait for this game to come out
[2:30:32] <DSD24> Yeah I haven't got a handle on conversion yet
[2:30:39] <CuddleKahn> Literally jesus christ
[2:30:41] <Anthrozzz> scary throw mix up woolie
[2:30:43] <Aussie_Manny> yes, jesus christ indeed
[2:30:43] <Shardlab> I love Vanguard
[2:30:43] <%Shad0wTag> DEMONS WIN
[2:30:45] <+hush_wolf> vanguard go hard
[2:30:47] <DSD24> Its basically to make yourself safe on moves right?
[2:30:54] <roz_en> OH THAT VANGAURD COLOUR IS HAWT
[2:30:54] <critfumble_> crus mirror match must be very funny
[2:31:01] <critfumble_> hammer fight in a phone booth
[2:31:14] <Renkage> The only character I want to be added is Monk. I honestly think Woolie would love "Boxing 4 Jesus" man
[2:31:21] <sexycars420> have screen normals are great
[2:31:31] <+FoxLex_> Oh Vanguard that isn't me
[2:31:35] <Aussie_Manny> The power of christ compels you to GET OFFA ME!
[2:31:43] <aka_Jigawatt> i wish there were cross ups BibleThump
[2:31:48] <DSD24> God grant me strength!
[2:31:48] <+Superbro64> BLESS UP
[2:32:11] <+MyooMyoo> Smited
[2:32:22] <DSD24> Berserker is also a really fun character
[2:32:22] <+FoxLex_> is the lobby full?
[2:32:26] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> Fighting Vanguard as Striker makes the no training mode hurt
[2:32:38] <@Menitta> Maybe it's because I haven't gotten used to it yet but I feel like this game has the most fear in just getting up from a knockdown.
[2:32:40] <sexycars420> baited
[2:32:41] <OldOnyx> @aka_Jigawatt my actual problem with most block button games
[2:32:48] <+SweetBeanAmin> praise be to yevon
[2:32:52] <@Menitta> it feels like everyone has an option
[2:33:02] <@Menitta> Several Options rather
[2:33:03] <roz_en> @PhallicTechnoPirate Striker seems to have it rough against Vangaurd and Berserker the most. She's busted otherwise
[2:33:06] <$Holycow8498> How is DNF duel?
[2:33:12] <Aussie_Manny> Everyone else already has a dance partner.
[2:33:17] <@Menitta> Aw I shoulda stayed in
[2:33:20] <+Superbro64> I saw kizzie kay near infinitely cancel Berserker's normals and I loled
[2:33:22] <sexycars420> green crusader's pants fuck
[2:33:23] <Shiibbae> cant resit the green
[2:33:24] <DSD24> I had real trouble against a Striker as Crusader
[2:33:29] <%Plus_On_Black> Green Monk
[2:33:32] <Aussie_Manny> Green and gold!
[2:33:33] <+FoxLex_> Is this Vanguard making you take caution every second?
[2:33:34] <Thunderhog> it's more that the rest of the room is blocking new people
[2:33:35] <Renkage> Has Woolie gravitated towards Crusader? Or is he just rotating characters?
[2:33:38] <roz_en> You look like a christmas tree with that colour
[2:33:39] <$SilverRoddo> Dr. Doom
[2:33:50] <DSD24> Nah this green looks nice
[2:33:51] <gyrobasel> can you not change the stage?
[2:33:59] <+thedream_c> yeah Van and Crusader may have the ranges, but they play a different kinda game
[2:33:59] <%Plus_On_Black> Kinda litty, not going to lie
[2:34:04] <roz_en> Or Twilight princess Ganondorf Crusader, either or
[2:34:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1470652875344949248?t=1NaM-qpmZm4ocGrxe4MvNg&s=19
[2:34:09] <+thedream_c> Van def wants to play catch a button
[2:34:14] <aka_Jigawatt> A-MEN
[2:34:15] <Thunderhog> He has it auto set to this stage. he could pickk random, but this is his choice
[2:34:17] <%mr_sups> @Renkage Pretty much all Crusader
[2:34:19] <+ikasukiz> @gyrobasel you can, just set to auto/random I think
[2:34:21] <+Shishi1205> I just saw a dude use wall wall wall into super with crusader lmaooooo
[2:34:24] <Aussie_Manny> A! A! A! MEN!
[2:34:25] <kressywastaken> OH this  game comes out in Summer with ghost blade being the next character
[2:34:26] <BlackermanZX> someone has to mod crusader and make Holy Woolie
[2:34:42] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> @roz_en I can totally see that. It feels like you never know when she's gonna stop attacking
[2:34:43] <sexycars420> HALLEJUAH
[2:34:47] <+thedream_c> DNF DUel's full roster may be its appeal
[2:34:47] <DSD24> I like Crusader color where he has black armor and white hair
[2:34:54] <+thedream_c> along with 800 yen DLC chars :p
[2:35:06] <+Shishi1205> colour 2 is good on crusader
[2:35:06] <%Plus_On_Black> I fuck with everyone in this chat. ya'll aight.
[2:35:07] <+Superbro64> I feel like Sader and DK are easily the best in the game currently, but everyone has something that's mad broken
[2:35:10] <+ikasukiz> man why this game gotta come out in 6 months, unless they plan on a second beta with more characters available the wait is gonna suck
[2:35:16] <+Shishi1205> dark templar vibes
[2:35:16] <Aussie_Manny> A! A! A! MEN!
[2:35:17] <@Menitta> I imagine the full roster will be 16 judging by the char select screen
[2:35:19] <sexycars420> the pants are so fucking cool on this crusader color
[2:35:22] <+thedream_c> im okay with the wait
[2:35:22] <$SilverRoddo> Our God is an Awesome God
[2:35:22] <DSD24> Shit that's what its used for
[2:35:23] <Onorekian> lol
[2:35:24] <kressywastaken> The fact that they are adding ghost blade means that they arent limiting it to one subclass per main class so anything goes
[2:35:27] <aka_Jigawatt> @BlackermanZX i feel like that'll be fairly easy too, just give em dreds and make him black and thats literatley him
[2:35:28] <+thedream_c> I have other stuff to look into the next 5 months
[2:35:33] <fIashman92> Woah, I've never seen that attack
[2:35:34] <roz_en> @roz_en Yeah. No matter who it is, she gets you in a corner, you are DONE
[2:35:37] <+Superbro64> Once everyone figures how the passives / buffs / debuffs work, there's that too
[2:35:57] <+thedream_c> I want to see other mode they will add to this game
[2:36:01] <Aussie_Manny> A! A! A! MEN!
[2:36:07] <+thedream_c> *modes I mean
[2:36:10] <sexycars420> that was crazu
[2:36:12] <Shiibbae> A , A, A, A, MEN

[2:36:29] <sexycars420> big hammer
[2:36:30] <+Tornix> I'm surprised woolie doesn't go for high/low after those lasers instead of sideswap
[2:36:31] <Anthrozzz> Amen
[2:36:36] <+thedream_c> yeah woolie has to do more of that jump hammer keep away vs Vans
[2:36:37] <Aussie_Manny> omg that hammer is HUGE
[2:36:42] <kressywastaken> Armageddon which you can sac the shield to summon

[2:38:20] <+thedream_c> the only thing Infinite is Gods Grace
[2:38:20] <roz_en> When was the last time a FG referenced old Ryu?
[2:38:22] <+Superbro64> if you have 200 meter it might be more worth it to avoid red meter penalty
[2:38:23] <%mr_sups> 8-Win Streak
[2:38:24] <+FoxLex_> Don't get infinite
[2:38:29] <DSD24> Grappler has a cool Grappler Baki color
[2:38:29] <gyrobasel> thank you, the ambient sound from the volcano stage was pissing me off
[2:38:30] <+FadingEmber> wow he is still going
[2:38:35] <DSD24> Oh yeah there it is
[2:38:35] <Aussie_Manny> I wonder if this Grappler knows the infinite.
[2:38:47] <+thedream_c> the infinite comes via an AA right?
[2:38:49] <Anthrozzz> @DSD24 Does look like BAKI
[2:38:51] <prime_name> Do you know who also came back from Loser's Bracket? Jesus Christ.

[2:40:16] <Aussie_Manny> BONK BOP
[2:40:17] <+thedream_c> yes grappler is slow

[2:40:26] <+Shishi1205> you can 1,2 wall teice
[2:40:31] <+Shishi1205> twice
[2:40:32] <JoviLovesYou> A little slow but this ;guys also new.

[2:40:37] <Aussie_Manny> ooooh he's got an armoured charge
[2:40:41] <KaironFortressKnight> he has a few armor moves to get in
[2:40:42] <DSD24> Holy Hammers can't withstand ARMOR
[2:40:58] <+thedream_c> will Woolie convert this new player?
[2:41:10] <+thedream_c> the life of a grappler is a hard one. A crusader only has their steel faith
[2:41:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:41:14] <+sonofthedeepsouth> loops
[2:41:17] <LavenderHorns> I've been having a blast with grappler, but not having any invincible defensive options is rough when everyone else does lol
[2:41:17] <%dreadedcthulhu> what the FUCK did i just watch lmao
[2:41:21] <Aussie_Manny> A! A! A! A! MEN!
[2:41:23] <DSD24> Yoooo that's dirty

[2:41:38] <Shiibbae> latom
[2:41:41] <+Hacerous> a man of god is not cheap! he is BLESSED!
[2:41:43] <Frampis> Crusader loves God
[2:41:46] <DSD24> The problem with Crusader is that he can't do shit when getting rushed down
[2:41:47] <+Tornix> there's no air block
[2:41:49] <%mighty_max_t> And the Lord said...."GGs"
[2:41:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> and a heavy ass hammer
[2:41:51] <+thedream_c> It is only cheap if you believe
[2:41:56] <+Shishi1205> check your mentions for more combos @woolieversus
[2:41:59] <+frydaynitefight> ggs bro
[2:42:04] <ElPlasa> YEYEYEYE
[2:42:05] <+Shishi1205> yeyeyye
[2:42:06] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> Grappler does have an air-to-ground grab though
[2:42:06] <%Giothegame> I wonder if you loop fast enough to make them go high, you have time to jump and set up Apocalypse on top of them
[2:42:07] <DSD24> Yoooo that's the good color
[2:42:10] <ultimntpenguin> @dsd24 he has the best 1 button dp what

[2:42:15] <TheBadonkulator> the Tommy Lee Jones
[2:42:19] <aka_Jigawatt> a diffrent kind of god monkaS
[2:42:22] <+TheScorpionEater> @DSD24 except for armored dp, or counter, or slow projectile LUL
[2:42:23] <+FoxLex_> Alright time fund the lobby
[2:42:24] <$SilverRoddo> Light everlasting
[2:42:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Crusader returned from the holy land with a tan
[2:42:26] <fumbles_tho> Skin color is just a choice
[2:42:27] <+FoxLex_> *find
[2:42:29] <kulmoth> so you enjoying the dnf duel?
[2:42:32] <+Makouzer> why does the gmae audio sound like its underwater?
[2:42:37] <DSD24> @ultimntpenguin What I mean is that I"M not good with Crusader in the corner
[2:42:40] <+Tornix> can't wait for the lord to smite crusader on final release
[2:42:45] <+Superbro64> Secret of Kells :(
[2:42:45] <+thedream_c> a true man of the cloth
[2:42:46] <ultimntpenguin> fair lmao
[2:42:47] <+Gairbair724> buff jesus lets go
[2:42:51] <+TopTieramisu> black and white alt colors are OP
[2:42:51] <+hush_wolf> sumD
[2:42:51] <+LastHazzerd> you have the power of anime god on your side
[2:42:53] <Anthrozzz> God and Anime Woolie
[2:42:54] <+thedream_c> when the cloth reflects your truth
[2:43:04] <%Giothegame> That's a glitch with Twitch @makouzer refresh
[2:43:13] <+Tennochief> AMEN
[2:43:19] <+thedream_c> wow Woolie testing his own faith
[2:43:25] <+thedream_c> with the walls behind his back
[2:43:37] <JoviLovesYou> Nice
[2:43:40] <+TopTieramisu> nice
[2:43:43] <aka_Jigawatt> nice
[2:43:48] <Anthrozzz> God and Anime Failed
[2:43:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> psalm 59 needs to play during crusader intro.
[2:43:50] <+Hacerous> has anyone seen a guard break yet?
[2:43:56] <TigerClaws12> REPENT BOP
[2:43:57] <Aussie_Manny> Ooooohhh, Duke was hustlin' us the whole time??
[2:44:05] <+thedream_c> Crusader def tests your faith
[2:44:10] <JoviLovesYou> I'm gonna call that empty jump intentional lol
[2:44:11] <+ArmoredAnathema> @Hacerous Just watch enough crusader matches
[2:44:17] <+thedream_c> if you can come back from 50% life deficit, you def believe in your own ability
[2:44:19] <Thunderhog> @Hacerous Had it happen once to me, and that's mostly cause vanguard's awakening skill forces guard meter to drop fast
[2:44:21] <TheBadonkulator> one stray beam interrupted his string
[2:44:23] <Aussie_Manny> the Cross up
[2:44:24] <roz_en> Woolie talking about Bible stuff has the same energy as when he talks about racism
[2:44:35] <+thedream_c> but thats the thing. Vanguard has the ability to REACH people
[2:44:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Respect in fighting games?
[2:44:39] <+thedream_c> if you don't believe that, you can't win
[2:44:50] <roz_en> Race wars specifically
[2:44:51] <+Hacerous> @Thunderhog is it like a crumple or more like GG?
[2:45:05] <Shiibbae> no matter where you are on screen, he is going to GET you
[2:45:09] <Aussie_Manny> Exhaustion!
[2:45:10] <DSD24> Look how good he looks
[2:45:11] <aka_Jigawatt> amen
[2:45:15] <theredfox930000> woolie teaching them
[2:45:19] <Anthrozzz> The Power of God and Anime
[2:45:21] <+Makouzer> wtf is crusader that cheap?
[2:45:24] <+thedream_c> the Van/Crusader MU def defense/life lead focused
[2:45:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Never nerf Crusader.
[2:45:39] <+Tornix> @Makouzer he's got some dumb stuff
[2:45:43] <+thedream_c> Crusader gets to play his prayers. But Van can def crack that faith
[2:45:45] <+Shishi1205> crusader is fun af
[2:45:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Crusader must stay the same even after full release
[2:45:54] <+Shishi1205> It reminds me of beta Pot
[2:45:58] <aka_Jigawatt> all these char cheap af tbh
[2:46:02] <+FoxLex_> But now you lost your passive
[2:46:06] <+thedream_c> Van can fight Crus well
[2:46:11] <+Makouzer> i guess it is a beta
[2:46:13] <Shiibbae> HE W I L L FIND YOU
[2:46:14] <+wolvenelf> Damn, i didnt realize r1 was a cancel. jeez. that opens up things
[2:46:18] <Aussie_Manny> THE RANGE
[2:46:19] <Shiibbae> HE IS GOING TO FUCKIN G E  T YOU
[2:46:22] <aka_Jigawatt> inquistor got a big ass wheel that lasts forever
[2:46:27] <+thedream_c> Vanguard can REACH to people. But Van players have to BELIEVE that in order to win
[2:46:31] <BlackOrchidKI> Stickin' him from DOWNTOWN
[2:46:37] <aka_Jigawatt> ranger makes people rage quit
[2:46:40] <%Shad0wTag> I don't think I've been more worse at a game playing this
[2:46:42] <theredfox930000> throw out more random walls
[2:46:43] <Aussie_Manny> Duke is working HARD for that results screen! LUL
[2:46:45] <+Ergomancy> I still wonder..is there a difference in using the motion inputs for MS attacks as opposed to direction+MS?  less cost? slightly more damage?
[2:46:57] <+Shishi1205> mana regen
[2:46:59] <$SilverRoddo> Shepherd this stray lamb
[2:47:04] <%Shad0wTag> I literally just cannot learn from just playing on the go, without actualy practicing it feels nightmarish
[2:47:12] <+Hacerous> Spreading the word.. OF THE LAWD!
[2:47:15] <+thedream_c> just get repts ^^^
[2:47:16] <@Menitta> I'm still laughing at "Give Unto Thee Our Daily Bread and Butters"
[2:47:30] <BlackOrchidKI> LUL
[2:47:32] <+thedream_c> if there is no 'practice mode' just keep playing and be mindful of what you need to focus on
[2:47:44] <Aussie_Manny> A! A! A! A! MEN!
[2:47:51] <sexycars420> Give unto thee thy daily bread and butters
[2:47:51] <JoviLovesYou> He didn't knoooowww
[2:47:53] <emptyantics> AND I SHALL SMITE THEE
[2:47:55] <+Shishi1205> also knowing this game allows for some wild cancels without training mode you have to rely on the Internet to find them
[2:47:57] <kinkade_77> that dark move is so sick
[2:48:00] <+Geograffy> I've tried getting into a few fighting games, but nothing has clicked with me so hard as playing Striker
[2:48:05] <Shiibbae> and on the 3rd set, god said 'let there be oki'
[2:48:05] <+Kilikan5670> Huh....I haven't seen one Crusader do that yet
[2:48:06] <+Tornix> man jump hammer is better than I thought
[2:48:12] <%Shad0wTag> @thedream_c Yeah that doesn't work for me as get my ass whooped by people with more experience in this than me
[2:48:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:48:21] <+FoxLex_> I guess the lobby is full
[2:48:22] <dead_pixels> ALLE! LUUUUUJAHHHH!!
[2:48:29] <Aussie_Manny> Haha, Duke is hogging all the Woolie.
[2:48:30] <kressywastaken> It is the prayer of discipline. DO YOU LIVE IN A CAVE?
[2:48:35] <sexycars420> woolie eating stream Pog
[2:48:39] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! praise be
[2:48:41] <InfinitySaiyan> That hammer aegis loop is basically Heaven’s Mochi
[2:48:45] <+Makouzer> its so funny to see woolie play a hyper religous heavy
[2:48:55] <ryogeo> @WoolieVersus woolie needs food baddly
[2:48:57] <@Menitta> I regret leaving lmao
[2:49:03] <+thedream_c> this is another good BGM
[2:49:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> this games music is groovy
[2:49:06] <Afrosamasenpai> mmm this theme
[2:49:12] <%Major_Lee_> whats up with that portal
[2:49:16] <sexycars420> woolie is playing an alternate timeline woolie
[2:49:24] <Aussie_Manny> Could Jesus lab an infinite so long, that he himself would ragequit it?
[2:49:24] <+thedream_c> i always knew DFO always had the style to make it for a FG
[2:49:36] <sexycars420> big shoulder
[2:49:41] <BlackOrchidKI> @thedream_c I'm just surprised it took this long
[2:49:54] <froznsun937> that loop is so bm lol
[2:49:57] <@Menitta> God those loops are so dirty
[2:49:58] <BlackOrchidKI> On the other hand, there's no better time than now, in the age of Rollbackia
[2:49:59] <emptyantics> @thedream_c Same but I never thought we’d see the day
[2:50:03] <kaptain_marty> omg
[2:50:05] <+Tornix> ew
[2:50:09] <+frydaynitefight> @woolieversus any chance for a run back before you end stream?
[2:50:12] <+RyTYoung> ouch
[2:50:15] <sexycars420> jump over the wall
[2:50:34] <+thedream_c> @BlackOrchidKI I can agree somewhat.  Stars had to align for ASW to get popular enough with their aesthetics and companies to be convinced
[2:50:44] <fIashman92> So jumping when the buff ends negates the animation?
[2:51:15] <BlackOrchidKI> I can agree with that
[2:51:19] <+Ergomancy> GOD BLESSED, crusader's got some nasty shit.
[2:51:34] <+thedream_c> if y'all believe, Crusader will keep this stuff post beta
[2:51:38] <+thedream_c> but you must pray
[2:51:53] <Azelstahn> Can't wait to see more of the bgm be put in. Pandemonium rift is a good one.
[2:51:55] <+thedream_c> and keep to those prayers until the day of judgment arrives
[2:51:58] <kressywastaken> With how much money DFO makes you better believe they got the funds to just THROW to make a fg
[2:52:01] <+thedream_c> R A P T U R D
[2:52:03] <%notsoy> fuckin jam sessin/captain corridor
[2:52:04] <kressywastaken> Im just surprised it took so long
[2:52:06] <Aussie_Manny> To the HEAVENS
[2:52:07] <+UmjackTah> woolie has finally accepted the power of jesus
[2:52:10] <Anthrozzz> With the power of God and Anime
[2:52:15] <itsno4ce> Can't escape God
[2:52:15] <emptyantics> HAMMER OF DAWN
[2:52:18] <+AurryVS> I BESHEECH THEE, GET FUCKED
[2:52:21] <Aussie_Manny> I'm loving how much Woolie is loving Crusader LUL
[2:52:33] <Frampis> In the full version you can't play Crusader if you're not a Christian
[2:52:34] <+Shishi1205> it's good BC it's from s
[2:52:34] <+frydaynitefight> no worries
[2:52:38] <+thedream_c> @kressywastaken I think Granblue set the precendence for gacha devs with the money to work with ASW
[2:52:40] <FlowLethal> I have no wall but i can if i believe
[2:52:40] <BlackOrchidKI> I only wish Monk was in the game
[2:52:46] <%Plus_On_Black> Still, yo ass need to chill Woolie lol
[2:52:48] <Aussie_Manny> BOP
[2:52:50] <ElPlasa> SPICY
[2:52:52] <+Geograffy> Here I go buying another fighting game that I'll tell myself I'll dedicate time to get better at
[2:52:55] <kressywastaken> Youre probably right
[2:52:59] <Aussie_Manny> woolieYIKES oooooooooooo
[2:53:03] <+Shishi1205> @woolieversus  that's the good shit right?
[2:53:17] <+thedream_c> but Nexon has the awareness to take this platform and take care of it on a global scale
[2:53:18] <+thedream_c> hopefully
[2:53:26] <+Shishi1205> I saw that and was like that's wild
[2:53:30] <+frydaynitefight> the power of god and woolie will make me a better grappler
[2:53:34] <+doscolas> i wanna see this lol
[2:53:35] <+thedream_c> as Granblue is strapped to their own world and can't really make those extreme QOL changes
[2:53:36] <kressywastaken> Ive never played a fighting game but the combination of this being super beginner friendly and being a favorite IP of mine makes me want this game to do well so bad
[2:53:37] <Shiibbae> i heard the click go off in his brain
[2:53:38] <@Menitta> Friday is about to get crucified
[2:53:39] <Aussie_Manny> woolieEVIL WWJD
[2:53:44] <+Makouzer> now do it on first try
[2:53:55] <+thedream_c> plus 8ing is involved so I gotta pay attention
[2:54:06] <aka_Jigawatt> infinite? monkaS
[2:54:10] <lonosis47> Why isnt the beta on ps4
[2:54:11] <kressywastaken> Even if this game stays in the realm of casual party fighter
[2:54:13] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> If I play Grappler, those are my colours
[2:54:14] <+BackwardCap> Seeing what is possible because of watching a combo is way more important than actually performing said combo OWLSombra
[2:54:15] <+thedream_c> grappling witht he Holy Spirit
[2:54:18] <kressywastaken> just let it not fade away
[2:54:23] <+thedream_c> FULL OF GRACE
[2:54:23] <Hoarseplay> I'm so happy 8ing is developing this game.
[2:54:28] <fairore> lmao
[2:54:28] <+thedream_c> Woolie give this Grappler the grace they need
[2:54:29] <LoreKeeper_Thal> gonna turn that man into Jacob LUL
[2:54:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> yo bibble fighting game when?
[2:54:34] <emptyantics> OHH SHIT GRAPPLER TIME
[2:54:34] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> it is @lonosis47
[2:54:36] <Aussie_Manny> Jacob the Heavenly Grappler.
[2:54:38] <+fizzguy47> pot colors
[2:54:39] <@Menitta> Jacob was GOING TO GET that blessing.
[2:54:39] <%Major_Lee_> I NEED that blessing
[2:54:39] <Deko_> sick color
[2:54:40] <+thedream_c> it may be heavy, but the heavines of the grace will save YE
[2:54:41] <cinless> it sucks that they went for m grappler and not f grappler
[2:54:43] <Hoarseplay> @lonosis47 It is. You might need to go to the website to download it.
[2:54:44] <InfinitySaiyan> Deus Vult
[2:54:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @Major_Lee_ I KNOW YOU GOT THAT BLESSING
[2:54:53] <Arqartur0> Oh those colors are banging!
[2:54:54] <+McSoliace> grapplers middle name is jacob
[2:54:57] <$SilverRoddo> Legendary ladder match
[2:55:02] <Blank9> dear god the immediate wall smashing
[2:55:12] <+thedream_c> Grappler ye of little faith
[2:55:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:55:21] <Arqartur0> @WoolieVersus I know you said Jacob,  but I hear J-Cup >.>
[2:55:32] <+thedream_c> your infinite is based on punishment. But Crusader only has infinite love of Christ for you
[2:55:42] <+Makouzer> music is so good
[2:55:42] <@Menitta> I bet every character has an infinite lol
[2:55:44] <BlueVexer> Grappler "Jacob" Dungeonfighter
[2:55:50] <BlackOrchidKI> I'm praying the Monk sub-class for this guy makes it into this game
[2:55:55] <+thedream_c> John "Jacob" Grappler
[2:56:00] <BlackOrchidKI> Every fighter needs a boxer, right?
[2:56:09] <%Major_Lee_> Yo put the monk in so woolie can punch with god
[2:56:20] <+PhallicTechnoPirate> Do counters work on throws?
[2:56:38] <+thedream_c> Crusader and Monk are full of grace
[2:56:45] <LavenderHorns> @PhallicTechnoPirate I don't think so
[2:56:45] <%kyh9> Nah, give me the Exorcist for Peak DrStrange zoning
[2:56:46] <Hoarseplay> You arms are too short to box with God, but not MINE!
[2:56:46] <NotHereToStream> grappler? how about catch these fist of holiness
[2:56:47] <kressywastaken> I hope if they add monk that they have the Neo awakening animation as the super
[2:56:53] <Arqartur0> Grappler reminds me of the Tae-Kwon class from Ragnarok Online
[2:56:56] <%kyh9> Exorcist > Avenger > Monk > Crusader
[2:57:05] <Renkage> The Monk has a fun mechanic where you places a religious pillar into the ground and declares the area around the pillar as his boxing ring, giving him buffs
[2:57:07] <InfinitySaiyan> Biblically Blessed Grappler
[2:57:18] <%Major_Lee_> Female grappler would have been the better choice imo
[2:57:21] <%Shad0wTag> @Renkage FUCKING WHAT
[2:57:23] <+thedream_c> get Sunday Schoold Grappler
[2:57:24] <emptyantics> Kunoichi already confirmed to have an infinite
[2:57:30] <Hoarseplay> @Arqartur0 M.Grappler takes a lot of influence from TKD, Muay Thai, and Judo with his design.
[2:57:32] <DSD24> Kunoichi is really fun
[2:57:36] <BlackOrchidKI> @Shad0wTag Yeah, it's called Driver, and it's the sickest
[2:57:37] <+Akizea> @Renkage OH YEAH HE DOES I FORGOT
[2:57:43] <Aussie_Manny> GOTTEM
[2:57:44] <Azelstahn> The monk's weapon is actually a pillar but that's what he does for his ring yeah
[2:57:48] <Hoarseplay> @Arqartur0 I meant M.Fighter in general, but Grappler also counts.
[2:57:53] <BlackOrchidKI> A Totem, rather
[2:57:55] <%Shad0wTag> @BlackOrchidKI Woolie has to know that, he'll love that
[2:57:55] <$ggbhtg> Woolie gets to have FT10s, while I get DCd from 50% of my matches doodSad
