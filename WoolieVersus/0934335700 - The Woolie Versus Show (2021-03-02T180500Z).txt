[0:00:33] <%Noonoox12> Batman is my favourite anime
[0:00:34] <%X2Eliah> Batman is basically a Shinobi

[0:01:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Solidus_113 Got it
[0:01:22] <pi_in_the_sci> The final boss in Knight is horrible and part of the batmobile gimmick that killed the fun in that game, but the final boss of Asylum is still way worse

[0:01:57] <%X2Eliah> Idk, could be real fun with V
[0:01:57] <+nightwing1936> Surprised it took woolie this long to finally do it
[0:01:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> I hope it's with Reggie
[0:01:58] <+Chartreuseowl> NO ONE BE "THAT GUY"
[0:01:59] <bitterpelican> Oh shit

[0:02:14] <DelgotHansto> BATMAN visits Stadia Gameworks
[0:02:16] <%krispen_wa> THE MEMES DIE HERE
[0:02:20] <frostyjay3> I wonder what version he's playing considering he was talking about it on the podcast
[0:02:21] <%X2Eliah> Actually, thursdays' Sekiro thing. Is that Reggie Plays Sekiro? Or Woolz?
[0:02:25] <+smoe79> History in the Making!

[0:02:31] <masterfire23> you haven't watched Netflix deathnote?
[0:02:33] <%Noonoox12> @krispen_wa Your memes end here
[0:02:36] <thebalticguy1> Reggie doesnt know shit about DC right?
[0:02:36] <NewWillinium> Oh this is going to be *fun*. Especially if Woolie ends up falling for the same thing I did where I thought the game was crashing but . . .didn't.
[0:02:42] <deviljhojho_> i actually fucked up a lot during my first assylum run because i didnt know where to aim the claw lmao
[0:02:42] <%X2Eliah> shhh
[0:02:48] <%X2Eliah> no spoilz folks
[0:02:53] <+Chartreuseowl> All jokes aside, this game is a solid metroidvania with fun combat that holds up 12 years later
[0:02:54] <@Menitta> bam ham yum
[0:02:57] <+CoronetChris> woolieYE
[0:03:07] <Gamingc00l> @masterfire23 no don't do this to me
[0:03:11] <%X2Eliah> Bamham: a ham house
[0:03:11] <%emperordread> Boatman!?
[0:03:12] <%ThisIsLloyd> tovgHype
[0:03:15] <TheWizardOfWordplay> I hope he plays all 4
[0:03:18] <+RD_nx> I've never played asylum, only all the others so this is exciting
[0:03:18] <%thecalamityee> thecalamityee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! batman is so sick
[0:03:18] <+evbites> I stopped playing asylum when I was little because I was scared of the crazy people
[0:03:20] <NewWillinium> I wonder which version he's playing.   Like they came out with a "Remastered Edition" not too long ago right?
[0:03:27] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe Woolie's being sent to Arkham
[0:03:28] <deviljhojho_> yeah even origins is solid
[0:03:29] <+BigBruthaThunda> playing this on an old 360 was particularly terrifying at a certain part
[0:03:29] <%Exiliator> Bat-o mann
[0:03:29] <%mattwillpost> Dude is straight up about to play the wheel
[0:03:29] <Belakitu> Howdy y'all!
[0:03:30] <%Noonoox12> @Chartreuseowl .... I'd never thought of Asylum like a metroidvania... but I guess it kinda is, huh?
[0:03:30] <snakest3alth> Will it be Return to Arkham version or vanilla?
[0:03:30] <meganicmp3> will woolie finally fulfill his dream of beating up mentally ill criminals
[0:03:31] <@Solidus_113> I don't remember Arkham having any castlevania in it, only metroid
[0:03:32] <%zanzibar_junker> Changing artists and writers and event comic books really turn me off of collecting monthly comics
[0:03:33] <%reknownblackcat> did woolie miss this series? it's a surprising fun action game I hope he does the combat challenges on stream.
[0:03:34] <+bigcomfyman> do we get the Tim burton costume with the "Bat Nipples"?
[0:03:36] <triggersqueeze1985> Who voices Harley Quinn
[0:03:38] <amiavamp> What if woolie gets the anti-piracy bug lol? At the least, I had it happen to me with a Command and Conquer game even though I was using a Cd key straight off the disc I bought
[0:03:38] <@Menitta> I'm a weirdo who loves Origins the most
[0:03:39] <JZPotter> @newwillinium Hopefully, it's really well done
[0:03:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> @NewWillinium Oh boy you were here for the podcast yesterday lol Chat gave him shit for wanting to play the remakes
[0:03:41] <heart_ablaze> played this when I was like 8, still one of my top games of all time
[0:03:42] <seniormeatbox> Bat nips
[0:03:47] <+Katohearts> oh shit we batman now
[0:03:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> weren't*
[0:03:50] <@Solidus_113> Menitta I'm banning you
[0:03:50] <HollowMan190> yooooooooooooooo
[0:03:51] <%krispen_wa> this is the one where Arleen Sorkin still voices Harley Quinn
[0:03:53] <deviljhojho_> origins is underrated, just nost as good as the rest
[0:03:54] <%mattwillpost> @menitta origins is the shit
[0:03:55] <some_brave_apollo> can't believe Woolie's finally going to read Death Note
[0:03:55] <+jblur22> Batmane?
[0:03:55] <Grantu235> I remember playing this game 3 times trying to get a non corrupted file only to learn it was scarecrow
[0:03:57] <NewWillinium> @KeiganOfAstora REALLY? Dear gods why?
[0:03:59] <DelgotHansto> origins is fine
[0:03:59] <@Menitta> YOU CANT STOP ME

[0:04:05] <meganicmp3> batmon
[0:04:07] <TheWizardOfWordplay> Arleen sorkin voices her in this one. the voice from TAS
[0:04:07] <%krispen_wa> HELLFIRE
[0:04:08] <masterfire23> wonder which version he choose
[0:04:09] <+samuraiknack> HUGE BATMAN ARKHAM SPOILER Bruce Wayne is Batman

[0:04:23] <Esparsenior> Asylum is such a good game on its own. The others in the series are really good, but I’m always impressed that by Asylum since it holds up, a decade later
[0:04:28] <dinnydanny777> Banger Alert limesMusic
[0:04:29] <NewWillinium> @KeiganOfAstora I mean that is par for the course
[0:04:31] <+RD_nx> @menitta Origins has that solemn christmas feel so I can like it based on that

[0:04:37] <%L3m0nTwi5t> woolieGASM
[0:04:46] <RaidenRising> we live in a society
[0:04:49] <+CoronetChris> woolieONEGUY
[0:04:51] <Lancaster_H> I wish the harley outfit was always the classic one from knight
[0:04:54] <deviljhojho_> Batmobile turns knight from a 9 to an 8
[0:04:55] <%dreadedcthulhu> bamham gam
[0:04:56] <TheWizardOfWordplay> hot take: batmobile wasn't that bad
[0:04:57] <+DrPoxx> non lethal hit and runs with the batmobile lol
[0:04:58] <Lancaster_H> that one is so good
[0:04:58] <%krispen_wa> FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE
[0:04:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
[0:05:01] <joshua_42> FIGHT FOR YOU LIFE
[0:05:02] <%Noonoox12> I hated the batmobile. Dropped it pretty quickly 'cus of it, actually
[0:05:03] <amiavamp> Arkham series shows how to do Gears of War gritty grimdark but make it look actually good
[0:05:03] <%X2Eliah> oh jeez this remix
[0:05:03] <dinnydanny777> Batman gets a Harley outfit?
[0:05:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh, it's fight?
[0:05:10] <bitterpelican> Asylum graphically looks too plastic nowadays, but literally anything else in it is so fucking solid
[0:05:13] <deviljhojho_> yeah it actually almost made me drop the game lmao
[0:05:22] <deviljhojho_> i stuck with it and it was worth it but damn that thing sucks
[0:05:24] <%BestTeaMaker> BestTeaMaker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! You? You never played Batman?

[0:05:25] <@Menitta> I hate Knight lol
[0:05:25] <Dave_VD> @X2Eliah Pretty sure this is the original
[0:05:27] <NewWillinium> I always felt that City was the Apex of the series, where it had the most *right* about it, but I admit to having a huge soft spot for Knight.   I loved the costumes you got, how they integrated them into the cutscenes, and the Batmobile was GREAT for helping you fly around the city
[0:05:28] <+FuqBoiSlim> BamHam DarkArts Ashleyum
[0:05:29] <meganicmp3> how about another joke murray
[0:05:33] <jamox1> HEAVEN ON A LANDSLIDE
[0:05:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Arkham Knight was great for all of the cool costumes. You could be Tim Burton's Batman if you wanted to
[0:05:35] <huskarl_zap> WAIT WAT
[0:05:41] <+CoronetChris> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:05:45] <@Commando_Joe> You're finally getting what you want you animals
[0:05:47] <%Halospaz117> I honestly think all Arkham games are pretty rad
[0:05:49] <%robo_trunk> I'M THE JOKA BABEY
[0:05:50] <+evbites> City big but not too big
[0:05:50] <deviljhojho_> oink oink
[0:05:51] <+bigcomfyman> "Well hello, batman. or should I say...Butthole!"
[0:05:54] <%krispen_wa> i enjoyed origins's story the most besides the jebait
[0:05:55] <Lancaster_H> wait tho, how SHIT was the City Beyond costume
[0:05:57] <DatAsuna> @Menitta It has the best deathstroke fight though :P
[0:05:59] <Lancaster_H> like holy fuck
[0:06:00] <@Menitta> My problems with Knight that aren't the batmobile are all spoilers though
[0:06:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Commando_Joe Only if it's the right version *pushes up nerd glasses*
[0:06:01] <%Halospaz117> Some are more flawed then others, but they're still great fun
[0:06:03] <triggersqueeze1985> U get what u fucking deserve
[0:06:03] <%X2Eliah> I mean if you are not playing this in Adam West era costume, what are you even doing
[0:06:04] <Garry_Guyface> Bam, a ham yum
[0:06:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:06:07] <+hazardousmidget> woolieOMG
[0:06:08] <NewWillinium> I liked using the Batman Beyond and Thomas Wayne Costumes myself
[0:06:11] <TheWizardOfWordplay> Woolie finally gets his "grapple away" button
[0:06:15] <deviljhojho_> yeah knight also has some iffy plot stuff
[0:06:22] <+nabs2099> Aw man I got class rn but I wanna watch this! 😭
[0:06:22] <%marrs_bars> marrs_bars subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! It's a good day to use Detective Vision woolieSHOOK
[0:06:22] <deviljhojho_> knight in general has a very awkard tone
[0:06:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> The batman beyond costume was so bad
[0:06:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> At least in Knight
[0:06:26] <@Solidus_113> God I want a fucking proper Batman Beyond game
[0:06:28] <%robo_trunk> FAV Batman villain - Joker Not allowed - GO
[0:06:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cuz they changed it
[0:06:31] <RompFGC> arkham asylum??? WHY???
[0:06:32] <leith_aziz> Im mixed on Knight, but I think it was good in the end
[0:06:34] <NewWillinium> But it also has a lot of cool plot stuff. Or thing adjacent to the plot.
[0:06:36] <%krispen_wa> Two Face when written well
[0:06:40] <+Inverse_Girth> Arkham City is just better in every way but I love the whole series
[0:06:43] <%KeiganOfAstora> Arkham Knight Beyond suit is so chunky
[0:06:43] <+Zeroblazex> Knight’s atoey was weak compared to the others
[0:06:43] <Esparsenior> Let’s be real, every Arkham game contributes something great. They’re not all PERFECT, but all are solid games
[0:06:46] <%thechungiestofbois> thechungiestofbois subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Arkham Asylum is one of my favorite games from the PS3 era. Very excited for this LP
[0:06:46] <SheefEatsBeef> yo, i'm pretty excited for this playthrough. this game is dope.
[0:06:47] <amiavamp> A Batman Beyond game right now would be really on point with cyberpunk being at peak popularity
[0:06:49] <+Stormiercashew> Calendar man
[0:06:49] <frostyjay3> HEAVEN ON A LANDSLIDE
[0:06:51] <meganicmp3> knight had the batfleck skin which was cool
[0:06:51] <leith_aziz> Mister Freeze
[0:06:54] <dinnydanny777> Is the Batman Beyodn costume the one with the nipples
[0:06:54] <%agoaj> Gotta drink a bunch of NOS to unlock the batman beyond skin.
[0:06:55] <%X2Eliah> @Dave_VD Is it? huh. Jeez. I've heard these lyrics in at least one other rock/metal song, but way more dynamic and musical than this
[0:06:59] <Gamingc00l> asylum vs city here we go
[0:07:00] <%Livelinne> joofbLurk joofbLurk joofbLurk
[0:07:01] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Origins is still my favorite Arkham game by a long shot
[0:07:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> I left work early for this lol
[0:07:02] <triggersqueeze1985> Penny plunderer by far
[0:07:03] <user_naim> Now we must remember, this game still suffers from PS3 Woman Syndrome, where it has the one bodytype. Fortunately Batman is pretty hot too, so you have balance.
[0:07:04] <%Halospaz117> I actually liked the Knight Beyond costume once I started thinking of it as a prototype
[0:07:04] <ExpressNode> Everybody can skip Orgins though
[0:07:06] <%X2Eliah> though yeah maybe that was the remix
[0:07:09] <%MrKerb> Did Reggie beat demon souls?
[0:07:12] <%X2Eliah> ye
[0:07:13] <@Solidus_113> @robo_trunk Mad Stan
[0:07:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> @ExpressNode NO
[0:07:14] <deviljhojho_> origins had some solid bosses
[0:07:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> ORIGINS IS GOOD
[0:07:16] <bitterpelican> @robo_trunk Mr Fucking Freeze, dude did EVERYTHING for his wife's sake because he's just that loyal
[0:07:16] <%X2Eliah> Reggie big hero
[0:07:19] <+mattiabh> The best non metroid metroid game
[0:07:20] <%Noonoox12> @MrKerb ye. Last session was a whirlwind
[0:07:22] <deviljhojho_> probably the best in the series really
[0:07:24] <TheWizardOfWordplay> never skip origins
[0:07:25] <%krispen_wa> Dont skip Origins, it had good bosses and motherfucking BANE

[0:07:34] <%Halospaz117> Favorite Batman villain is always gonna be Scarecrow
[0:07:35] <velgaduere> SourPls
[0:07:35] <DelgotHansto> Origins is very fine despite the VAs
[0:07:38] <Papa_Bearman> If this is his first time, I feel like the hype is too high and he won't enjoy it as much as I believe he should.
[0:07:39] <%Livelinne> Who’s a good Batman? YOU ARE! joofbUWU
[0:07:40] <meganicmp3> origins is underrated for sure
[0:07:41] <Lancaster_H> Asylum is the better complete package, city is way more fun to just run around and fuck about
[0:07:43] <%krispen_wa> Origins Bane is like the only well adapted version of Bane
[0:07:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> Highly underrated
[0:07:46] <leith_aziz> I do wish Origin got some more recognition
[0:07:46] <+bigcomfyman> Bruce definitely has a picture of his dad in the bathroom with the caption "nice cock"
[0:07:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> that's weird... I subbed to Woolie before, but now it's says it expired

[0:07:53] <johnnydalmann> Roger Craig Smith is an excellent young batman
[0:07:54] <leith_aziz> Its always ignored in collections
[0:07:55] <+C0baltCrusade> how far do we imagine we're getting today, boys?
[0:07:55] <user_naim> Origins was cool. Good atmosphere, good bosses, the martial artists were sick
[0:07:58] <%Halospaz117> @DelgotHansto Not even despite, Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker do great
[0:07:59] <+C0baltCrusade> first boss maybe?
[0:08:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Origins had so much more going for it. Fucking snow Gotham! I played it every winter
[0:08:04] <HollowMan190> A superstitious cowardly lot
[0:08:06] <deviljhojho_> your sub expires after a mionth bro
[0:08:06] <meganicmp3> the investugation sections were a little meh tho
[0:08:07] <leith_aziz> I loved the bosses in origins
[0:08:08] <heart_ablaze> yeah origins is good, not as great as the two games before
[0:08:11] <seniormeatbox> Is this gonna be  woolie only, woolie n reggie, woolie n mihn, woolie n v?
[0:08:12] <Papa_Bearman> Gotta go Batman!
[0:08:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> origins actually had boss fights
[0:08:15] <ExpressNode> I guess the reception around Origin has changed since launch
[0:08:21] <leith_aziz> But the open world in that game was too big
[0:08:22] <deviljhojho_> that deathstroke boss fight in origins tho tomatoPog
[0:08:29] <%Exiliator> Exiliator subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Woolie, Woolie, Woolie! That's a name you should know! Woolie, Woolie, Woolie! He's the star of the show!
[0:08:31] <%thecalamityee> origins is the only game in the series with good bosses lmao
[0:08:32] <xdeathknightx> time for "whatever version of Arkham Asylum Woolie decided on, it's wrong" Kappa
[0:08:40] <Jaysky> Origins issue was the bugs but I liked the variety in villains even if the plot was bad in comparison to the others
[0:08:42] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Origins also came with the best looking collector's edition statue as well woolieGASM
[0:08:42] <theredfox930000> wait wait woolie hasn't played batman arkham asylum wollie the man that love metroid atpRtsd4 atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[0:08:43] <leith_aziz> City had some good bosses
[0:08:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's really weird, I had Woolie on my Prime sub and it removed it
[0:08:47] <%krispen_wa> its hard not for the reception to change when fucking Arkham Knight came after it and showed how bad the series could get
[0:08:47] <DelgotHansto> @halospaz117  of course but they aren't the voices I've grown attached to, it's a personal bias but that sort of thing affects me and I STARTED with Origins
[0:08:48] <brunoberserk> so ... is gonna be the remaster or the original ?
[0:08:49] <%X2Eliah> Hey as long as it is a version without DeNuvo spyware
[0:08:51] <HollowMan190> orgins by far has the best boss fights which isnt exactly a compliment
[0:08:52] <meganicmp3> BANE JOKER THO
[0:08:53] <leith_aziz> Ra's, Freeze and Finalö boss
[0:08:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Dude, the fucking CGI mo-cap trailer for Origins was incredible. Corridor Crew analyzed it and they did some revolutionary stuff to make it look as good as it did
[0:08:57] <%thecalamityee> except mr freeze
[0:08:58] <AndrewAIIStars> batarangs? batclaws? bat-SNACKS?!
[0:08:58] <alvaroeltz> City has the best boss

[0:17:49] <bitterpelican> And are you satisfied with this cursed knowledge, Darlington??? ARE YOU???
[0:17:49] <leith_aziz> I would just not read it if now one talked about it
[0:17:52] <%cache_22> @WoolieVersus Could you go over your library of games / books at one point? I would be interested in other "treasures" you have.
[0:17:52] <+RiverKing13> Does he know the new show is a detective show on the train?
[0:17:53] <Mattais88> That's the same reason I watched all of Gundam SEED
[0:17:54] <%robo_trunk> Di you get it at the comic store on St-Cath? I love that place
[0:17:55] <Lancaster_H> Reminder that this man got BACK IN to NARUTO

[0:18:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's like buying games digitally, but you don't know if you might later hate it, like ANTHEM
[0:18:04] <Prevot> when's the third book with the Glacial Driller
[0:18:05] <%jonblnt> you got to own it to make sure it's bad
[0:18:07] <velgaduere> @X2Eliah Frostcolostomizer
[0:18:09] <coreybom> So its a Kick Ass situation. Or just any Mark Millar adaptation situation.
[0:18:10] <agustorm123> You played yourself is like the titanic 2 LUL
[0:18:12] <valriot> ITS REAL FUCKIN GOOD
[0:18:15] <@Menitta> yeaaaaah it is
[0:18:17] <+HowIPendragon> @Lancaster_H Thank you for this reminder, lol
[0:18:19] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @X2Eliah Frostbiter would be more fitting.
[0:18:20] <+WizoSavage> Planned from the very fucking beginning
[0:18:20] <%LCLSmoothie> aot good
[0:18:21] <DatAsuna> Attack on Titan stuff you already saw was better than you currently know
[0:18:21] <jorniev> DONT TALK ABOUT IT CHAT
[0:18:22] <%thecalamityee> yep
[0:18:23] <ExpressNode> Is the third volume going to have another train on another track called the Ice Piercer
[0:18:23] <leith_aziz> What would you call the genre ?
[0:18:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's really REALLY good
[0:18:24] <+WizoSavage> amazing
[0:18:24] <GroundControl138> is it tho?
[0:18:24] <austinj24> IT DONT MISS
[0:18:24] <+skyheys> uhhhh
[0:18:27] <+nabs2099> I think AOT deserves to be that good tbh
[0:18:28] <%krispen_wa> How did we get this from the generic "fight the big monster" in season 1
[0:18:28] <%Asuterisuku> AoT is about two chapters away from its ending and yeah, it stays good.
[0:18:29] <%KeiganOfAstora> NO SPOILERS
[0:18:29] <jorniev> DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT
[0:18:32] <+RiverKing13> Attack on Titan was planned out from the beginning. That is the difference.
[0:18:33] <leith_aziz> But yeah, it seems great
[0:18:33] <meganicmp3> SUSH
[0:18:34] <DatAsuna> The first chapter retroactively became better
[0:18:35] <RaidenRising> TAO
[0:18:35] <%LCLSmoothie> NOBODY TALK ABOUT IT

[0:18:41] <Daniel910203> cheer750 Hey Woolie and Reggie, got an 11k bonus from my job and I thought to share some of the wealth. Especially on the first day where you guys finally play this great game. Soon you'll realize why Pat's disbelief of your lack of play is justified. Hope you're both caught up on your Batman and Harley Quinn lore, cause its going to be a trip!
[0:18:47] <leith_aziz> Its called "Execution"
[0:18:49] <nicversus> Bong Joon Ho is a better director than Mark Millar is a writer
[0:18:52] <bitterpelican> David Cage knocks on the window
[0:18:53] <meganicmp3> i read the manga its fine guys
[0:18:55] <%Asuterisuku> @JustToWatch That's just the plot of Metro though.
[0:18:56] <pixel_river> ive only watched season 1 of AOT LUL
[0:18:57] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @jamox1 I think that would turn him off from it
[0:19:04] <%Kriss1827> reggie i wouldnt wait it out lol
[0:19:05] <DatAsuna> Amazon warehouse is the ultimate death game

[0:19:08] <gregisonline> god i hope TWD does aliens eventually
[0:19:11] <WanderingSwordsman> what's with the set up?
[0:19:11] <thefunkiestpunkiest> I just hope Woolie never reads the boruto manga, it's awful.
[0:19:14] <ExpressNode> Like 999 or Dangonronpa?
[0:19:14] <%X2Eliah> China Mieville's Railsea is a great novel, btw.
[0:19:14] <Dave_VD> Cube

[0:19:38] <thefunkiestpunkiest> Gantz is just immigration patrol.
[0:19:39] <mike2hands> GENTZ?
[0:19:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I tested the PS4 on PS5 version yesterday and it's my first time playing Arkham City in years, going back to it AFTER playing SPider-Man is SO SLOW and JANKY

[0:20:09] <+MightyDuckShoes> Is AOT really that on the edge of being good or not?
[0:20:11] <leith_aziz> Not to say that 999 and Zero Escape are bad. They're GREAT I hear
[0:20:11] <%Exiliator> Gantz was a ride
[0:20:12] <+WizoSavage> Oh yeah the ending was trash
[0:20:13] <+froduck42> fuck Gantz
[0:20:15] <%LCLSmoothie> @sleepyboyp THRID TRAINNNNNNNNNNN
[0:20:17] <%X2Eliah> "There is a situation you are stuck in, you are gonna die, figure out how to escape" Meanwhile Reggie sweating trying to figure out what to do

[0:20:24] <%krispen_wa> @mightyduckshoes nah,its not on the edge. it IS good
[0:20:24] <bitterpelican> Kato Lol
[0:20:25] <DatAsuna> AoT is good regardless of how those 2 chapters go tbh
[0:20:25] <thefunkiestpunkiest> @MightyDuckShoes It's not THAT good, but people are shocked that people stay dead.
[0:20:26] <leith_aziz> Lets not give SAO credit.-..
[0:20:26] <amiavamp> God Eater is one that had big potential for lore but doesn't really capitalize on it
[0:20:27] <%Exiliator> CastleSuperBeast. Same thing. Kappa
[0:20:31] <masterfire23> log horizon is great
[0:20:32] <%mattwillpost> True scenario based shit is good
[0:20:34] <ExpressNode> I heard the author of High School of the Dead unfortunately past away
[0:20:34] <jaygee303> @nabs2099  I really hope so but it’s still up in the air, hasn’t fucked up so far

[0:20:44] <chll0ne> ZTD not so muc
[0:20:49] <@Menitta> Its BAFFLING how many times those stories have no plan
[0:20:50] <Lancaster_H> DATABASE DATABASE
[0:20:50] <%paladinstarbuster> what are we talking about
[0:20:51] <DatAsuna> Honkai Impact had a plan
[0:20:51] <+CoronetChris> I miss High School of The Dead
[0:20:54] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @X2Eliah The Woolie Versus Show was the real killing game all along.
[0:20:54] <%Asuterisuku> I liked ZTD.
[0:20:57] <%kewlmyc> Highschool of the Dead's author died, so it's not really the same
[0:20:57] <%Lion_kun> Darwin's Game had a plan.
[0:20:58] <andre11dr> Oh we doing this huh?
[0:21:00] <%Chatterbox1991> im gonna be real i hate this formula even when its thought out like AoT
[0:21:00] <chll0ne> ESPECIALLY SAO
[0:21:01] <meganicmp3> LIVING IN DA DATABASE
[0:21:02] <+RiverKing13> Snowpiercer sequels were written by a different writer to capitalize on the success of the first book.
[0:21:03] <chll0ne> THERE WAS NO PLAN

[0:21:04] <brondeef> lol GANTZ
[0:21:05] <KetsuoTaberu> LUL
[0:21:05] <+Wulfphelz> What is he talking about chat?
[0:21:07] <%mattwillpost> AOT in premise in garbage but it;s execution is SO fucking good
[0:21:07] <%krispen_wa> OH BOY
[0:21:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> good writers write backwards
[0:21:08] <chll0ne> BRO LITERALLY FORGOT
[0:21:10] <Tampaoster> @Lancaster_H living in the database oh oh
[0:21:11] <sirthomas2step> Gantz is nightmare fuel haha
[0:21:11] <Mattais88> "I'll figure out the reason later, right mow Jump needs a new chapter ASAP"
[0:21:11] <thefunkiestpunkiest> Gantz is so awful
[0:21:11] <Jaxnos> just straight for Gantz throat, i like it
[0:21:12] <jorniev> FOR NO GOOD REASON REGGIE
[0:21:12] <blastazoid00> ORB
[0:21:12] <+FuqBoiSlim> Gantz
[0:21:12] <%dreadedcthulhu> angel beats?
[0:21:13] <chainsaw105> is this Destiny?
[0:21:13] <$dudedude55555> GANTZ
[0:21:13] <DumbNerdThing> sometimes it's better when things are kept a mystery. oftentimes it's just because the writer is lazy
[0:21:13] <triggersqueeze1985> WONAN
[0:21:14] <+Wulfphelz> I just got here
[0:21:15] <RaidenRising> DATABASE DATABASE WOW WOW
[0:21:16] <%Deekman> best thing about Gantz was the theme song
[0:21:17] <%X2Eliah> @Wulfphelz just, like... life
[0:21:18] <%Feralspirit41> Man woolies on some shit
[0:21:19] <+WizoSavage> VAMPIRES
[0:21:20] <leith_aziz> I havent watched enough of that genre
[0:21:22] <nicversus> @jonblnt :D
[0:21:22] <amiavamp> Not great place to ask, but are there anime that are just MMO shenanigans without the death game or trapped aspect?
[0:21:23] <DatAsuna> @Wulfphelz stories with big mysteries that usually don't pay off
[0:21:23] <+WizoSavage> lol
[0:21:24] <blastazoid00> Vampires tho
[0:21:25] <Dave_VD> I hope that wasn't a big spoiler for 13 sentinels
[0:21:25] <Murdercles> man fuck you, Gantz is great
[0:21:26] <leith_aziz> So I cant judge
[0:21:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> VAMPIRES
[0:21:28] <MyNameIsRasus> what the fuck is going on
[0:21:29] <+skyheys> gantz is cool
[0:21:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> If they dont explain what caused the Zombie outbreak and the story has no resolution im not interested
[0:21:31] <AncelDeLambert> WOOLIEEEEEEEEEE!
[0:21:32] <+Stupid121v2> Gantz rules its so bad
[0:21:32] <%Deekman> oh my god I forgot about the Vampires arc
[0:21:33] <+nabs2099> @jaygee303 The only way the show ends "badly" will be up to the personal ideology of each individual viewer. which actually means the show is phenomenal. but there IS a right answer and it probably isn't the one that titanfolk are backing.
[0:21:34] <Prevot> we talking about that cube movie now?
[0:21:34] <+Someitalian123> don't worry about why
[0:21:35] <AncelDeLambert> MY BOI YA PLAYIN IT!!
[0:21:36] <Darkyello> gantz is the shit woolie
[0:21:36] <+Wulfphelz> Thanks yall!
[0:21:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The kid doing kung fu was neat
[0:21:40] <%osaka_daioh> its not dave_VD
[0:21:40] <DatAsuna> @Wulfphelz snowpiercer being the inciting example
[0:21:41] <jorniev> GANTZ is stupid fun BUT STUPID
[0:21:41] <%Exiliator> Okok ok! How about we make it about like. Factory-farming... but PEOPLE.
[0:21:41] <leith_aziz> So plan ahead
[0:21:45] <leith_aziz> Nice
[0:21:46] <@Solidus_113> Most stories are made with a vague start and ending, and everything in the middle is bullshit
[0:21:47] <bitterpelican> @leith_aziz Yo, we MAY have the original SAO. But we still have the glorious abridged series thanks to it, so bad things give some good consequences, shit's great
[0:21:48] <jaimethepanda> Gantz was dumb fun
[0:21:51] <aus_htx> lol bleach
[0:21:51] <+bs_commander> hell yeah gantz lol
[0:21:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Wulfphelz stories in media that only have a premise and not the story itself, so the media ends up messy
[0:21:53] <user_naim> I haven’t seen Westworld, but is this also Westworld?
[0:21:59] <%jonblnt> Gantz is the definition of style over substance
[0:22:00] <%Deekman> Dangaronpa 3's ending is the WORST
[0:22:01] <+Stupid121v2> V3 is peak video games
[0:22:01] <AncelDeLambert> this is hilarious, I JUST downloaded this game again last night because I was feeling Arkham vibes and needed to replay it
[0:22:02] <sirthomas2step> characters who ask why in gantz always die
[0:22:06] <pixel_river> LUL
[0:22:07] <%X2Eliah> ....
[0:22:09] <MyNameIsRasus> The Reggie face
[0:22:11] <blastazoid00> Bleach is the definition of making it up as you go
[0:22:11] <%kewlmyc> I remember that. It sucked.
[0:22:12] <@Menitta> What if me mum ran on battries

[0:32:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat left boooooo
[0:32:04] <chainsaw105> I like the Dead Island/Dying Light type zombies that start off fast then get slower as they decay
[0:32:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie plays by his own rules
[0:32:09] <asdief_> Algorithm be damned
[0:32:12] <AngryPhant0m> oh good they have not started eyt
[0:32:13] <enerkaizer> So, has Woolie seen who the new Batman in the comics is? Jace Fox is amazing as the new Dark Knight
[0:32:13] <youngking_kush> HE’S NOT WEARIN HOCKEY PADS
[0:32:14] <%RadDude6969> I might play Arkham Asylum too, been in my backlog for a while now
[0:32:14] <leith_aziz> Mine too
[0:32:14] <therealtacopancakes> who will be playing sekiro? reggie souls again?
[0:32:15] <NewWillinium> I fully expect Woolie to do a switcheroo and playing Fallout 4, 3, or Tactics before New Vegas
[0:32:15] <Dante_Namikaze1> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DEATH NOTE
[0:32:17] <blastazoid00> YOU'VE NEVER WATCHED DEATH NOTE?

[0:32:22] <%Halospaz117> Wasn't that said AT pat?
[0:32:22] <%doomerskeletor13> I played this game so much as a kid
[0:32:23] <peachy996> Keep in mind Woolie, Arkham Asylum is pretty basic since it was the first
[0:32:24] <scrublordsamurai> @woolieversus  i think you'd love the themes and story of Fallout: New Vegas
[0:32:25] <jorniev> LUL
[0:32:26] <%Asuterisuku> LUL chat
[0:32:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's all his about Death Note? I never saw it
[0:32:35] <+SilverInferno3> @Halospaz117 Yeah it's a Liam quote
[0:32:36] <leith_aziz> Its been so long since i checked Arkham games again
[0:32:36] <MyNameIsRasus> No back free from stabbing
[0:32:42] <%Halospaz117> Thought so
[0:32:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> @woolieversus you going after every Riddler trophy?
[0:32:42] <ExpressNode> I only went through Death Note halfway
[0:32:44] <jamox1> Truly the Woolie vs Golden Age
[0:32:45] <youngking_kush> Arkham City is the best tho
[0:32:47] <+TheotherKristian> So... why doesn't Woolie use the Sexbox he owns for the batman? what happen?
[0:32:51] <meganicmp3> more like cringe note
[0:32:54] <peachy996> Combat doesn't get into that real freeflow goodness until City but Asylum is still a good time
[0:32:57] <fuji_92> city is the best of the trilogy yeah
[0:32:57] <%Asuterisuku> Don't bother with Origins.
[0:32:58] <%X2Eliah> @TheotherKristian whaaa
[0:33:00] <leith_aziz> Favorite for me is either Asylum or City
[0:33:03] <%Exiliator> woolieLORE
[0:33:05] <leith_aziz> Like most people
[0:33:06] <@Solidus_113> that's the Kirby show lyrics
[0:33:08] <peachy996> Nah Origins is good
[0:33:08] <MyNameIsRasus> I personally think Reggie is the star
[0:33:11] <NoireRequiem> It is Rael
[0:33:12] <%Sparkseid> woolieLORE
[0:33:14] <AncelDeLambert> Origins is NOT good
[0:33:15] <PanicSwytch> Origins was good
[0:33:16] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s me, the Origins defender
[0:33:16] <+MrMediocrity> Keep a watch out for the spiderweb physics. They were cutting edge for their time apparently
[0:33:17] <%Lion_kun> Asylum>City>Knight
[0:33:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:33:19] <%LCLSmoothie> WE BACK IN SEKIRO

[0:33:19] <mudamudajo> I am just talk, I am the trash, I. Am. Woolieman!
[0:33:20] <%JaseAdrift> arkham city is the best one
[0:33:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @KeiganOfAstora Back on the Friendcast, Liam compared Pat getting on Woolie for not playing Arkham to someone saying "You haven't seen DEATH NOTE?"
[0:33:21] <leith_aziz> Origins is fine. It can be a fun time
[0:33:21] <jorniev> What are you dense, stupid? I am THE GODDAMNED BATMAN
[0:33:22] <%X2Eliah> ohh
[0:33:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Reggie said that like he's scared of Minh
[0:33:23] <TheWizardOfWordplay> do bother with origins
[0:33:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MIHN RETURNS

[0:33:32] <%X2Eliah> @KeiganOfAstora he should be
[0:33:32] <jamox1> HES BACK
[0:33:32] <+Neerb25> Asylum is stiffer and smaller than its sequels, but Asylum is a true Metroidvania and has a constant feeling of tension, so it's got that going
[0:33:33] <leith_aziz> Kiryu

[0:34:01] <devanmuse> Kiryu didn't murder kids, so he wins by default
[0:34:02] <meganicmp3> kiryu does heat moves
[0:34:03] <scrublordsamurai> minh
[0:34:04] <@Menitta> Its fine
[0:34:04] <leith_aziz> (I've played the later games)

[0:34:05] <jorniev> FUCK YOU one guy
[0:34:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:34:07] <+GenesisKnight> Kratos got better but Kiryu's been a better dad for longer
[0:34:07] <bitterpelican> Kiryu is a father Papa NieR WISHES he was
[0:34:08] <+cluckme_arse> eyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[0:34:09] <Mattais88> That dominatrix probably calls him daddy fi he wants
[0:34:09] <andre11dr> Kiryu is good dad ,kinda
[0:34:09] <Prevot> every one of those polls is just a popularity contest
[0:34:09] <peachy996> I think all 4 Batman games are good.
[0:34:10] <%Halospaz117> He just said he knows guys
[0:34:11] <fuji_92> good job one guy, fucoong spoilers
[0:34:11] <+Gohyakuen> origins is better than Knight
[0:34:12] <%JaseAdrift> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:34:14] <MyNameIsRasus> DISCORD
[0:34:15] <PanicSwytch> Asylum > City > Origins > Knight
[0:34:16] <+TheotherKristian> Alright here's my order. Asylum, Origins (yeah, I know), City, Knight
[0:34:16] <Dante_Namikaze1> The girl is what he's talking about but it's still not right to bring it up
[0:34:17] <MyNameIsRasus> PRESIDES
[0:34:20] <MyNameIsRasus> IN SOCIETY
[0:34:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Arkham Knight can fuck off though
[0:34:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Hot take: all the Arkham games are pretty good to great
[0:34:23] <%LCLSmoothie> jorker
[0:34:24] <MyNameIsRasus> YOUR SOCIETY
[0:34:27] <Darren716> Woolie tested Yakuza 3 so he knows Haruka exists
[0:34:31] <fuji_92> LUL
[0:34:34] <+TheotherKristian> The important thing is that Arkham Knight is fourth
[0:34:34] <meganicmp3> im da joka baby
[0:34:36] <NumbF4ke> Nioh so good
[0:34:40] <wibbwobbler> society
[0:34:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yeet
[0:34:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> "non lethal"
[0:34:41] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, you're going to have a good time with this game.
[0:34:44] <%RadDude6969> SO PSY A T
[0:34:45] <andre11dr> Also Pokemon pearl was the best 2d one ,and it deserves it
[0:34:49] <%Halospaz117> Batman pulling of Heat Moves
[0:34:49] <jorniev> EXTREMELY NON LETHAK
[0:34:49] <+Stupid121v2> this game is NON LETHAL
[0:34:50] <mudamudajo> I love the pic of Leto Jesus joker with the words poopoo and peepee in each hand.
[0:34:50] <leith_aziz> I cant choose between Knight or Origins. I think Knight brings new ideas at least, but not all of them are great
[0:34:51] <jamox1> It’s ok everyone, if we don’t like society we can blame the beasts
[0:34:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BATMAN HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[0:34:56] <jamox1> ^
[0:34:57] <%Wulfphelz> Numb arms are the worst LUL
[0:34:59] <JZPotter> Arkham Knight is the best one, Idgaf
[0:35:02] <fuji_92> sleep paralysis NotLikeThis yeah
[0:35:02] <bitterpelican> Yo
[0:35:02] <ralphfromdk> He has played PS4 spiderman / Miles Morales, right? he should be okay combat wise
[0:35:06] <pedrinoj> best worst movie that you recomennd?
[0:35:10] <prime_name> Numb Arms walking up is the worst
[0:35:10] <brunoberserk> City >> Knight >> Asylum >> Origin
[0:35:13] <Ipsenscastle> sleep paralysis is different to going numb
[0:35:14] <leith_aziz> I still prefer going for something new instaed of playing it safe
[0:35:14] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[0:35:17] <+WizoSavage> NEED AMPUTATE
[0:35:17] <triggersqueeze1985> Kiryu has never killed anyone
[0:35:18] <bitterpelican> What if. Batman. BUT WITH HEAT MOVES?
[0:35:19] <+nabs2099> Just imagine a Batman who doesn't know what sex is and you have a superior batman
[0:35:20] <+Neerb25> Knight has too much car puzzles/battles but it's still a terrific game. Driving around Gotham is fun and the combat is all-time best.
[0:35:21] <Depthcharge2030> Origins is slept on
[0:35:22] <%Asuterisuku> Knight has a lot of cool shit going on, but doesn't feel as cohesive a pachage as City.
[0:35:22] <user_naim> @pedrinoj Tokyo Drift
[0:35:23] <pixel_river> when that happens i try not to move
[0:35:25] <%X2Eliah> Or if one leg is dead and you gotta go to the bathroom
[0:35:25] <fuji_92> damn
[0:35:27] <+RPG_CHICAGO> the world has been waiting for this
[0:35:29] <+runegod20> my big fear is my bed collapsing in my sleep, getting stuck in the blanket, and suffocating
[0:35:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Car Parkour can fuck right off, Knight sucks
[0:35:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ipsenscastle But the sheer helpless panic is similar
[0:35:33] <MyNameIsRasus> Damn nice dude
[0:35:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> @RAAAAAINMAKER Wrong
[0:35:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Spider-Man is so much faster than Arkham, so you have to turn down your expectations
[0:35:49] <+Patch_TheSquid> patcht7Iroc patcht7Iroc patcht7Iroc patcht7Iroc
[0:35:50] <leith_aziz> You'll have fun
[0:35:52] <meganicmp3> get the collectables woolie
[0:35:52] <TheWizardOfWordplay> knights fine
[0:35:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh didn't see that said Car, my bad
[0:35:57] <+Dova573> the spiderman 2 of batman
[0:36:01] <+Zeroblazex> It’s a CLASSIC
[0:36:02] <%LCLSmoothie> batman is a big tank, spiderman is nimble and fast
[0:36:02] <AncelDeLambert> Spider Man does Open World right: small
[0:36:03] <fuji_92> yeah, batman is slow spider man
[0:36:04] <+Stupid121v2> woolie likes batman even a little so he'll be fine
[0:36:04] <%X2Eliah> It's more fun than COD
[0:36:06] <%KeiganOfAstora> Let's get it over with lol
[0:36:06] <wibbwobbler> ah man batman

[0:37:25] <%Exiliator> Not my fetish, but you do you
[0:37:25] <falyden> gurogirls
[0:37:26] <mudamudajo> Asylum really inspired a ton of what games still use now. Arkham combat is in the lexicon for a reason. So while some may have made it better, Asylum was the precursor.
[0:37:26] <leith_aziz> Point is: Dont be pretensious
[0:37:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> Reggie's face
[0:37:27] <+krispen_wa> MAJIMA?

[0:37:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie is in another realm
[0:37:44] <+eanscrale> It is just an exploitation series
[0:37:44] <johnnydalmann> that's a nope for me
[0:37:44] <aGuyFromPleven> Cheer500 yo Boys. Long time watcher, First time bitter. Enjoy Asylum. PS the combat system has more depth to it than it appears to have.

[0:38:23] <Tracazoid> You aren't missing out Reggie
[0:38:24] <%Halospaz117> You saved him Woolie
[0:38:24] <leith_aziz> Dont deny it
[0:38:25] <OldManDeckardCain> elfen lied's author pretty much only does this kinda mangas, except for that one weird ski jumping one LUL
[0:38:26] <Lancaster_H> Hey H-Doom is art
[0:38:26] <Shardlab> You're better off, Reggie
[0:38:29] <MyNameIsRasus> It's an edgelord's wet dream
[0:38:34] <%dreadedcthulhu> speaking of gory, has woolie read Chainsaw Man yet?
[0:38:36] <Tampaoster> Mnemosine is great guro too
[0:38:38] <%Wulfphelz> There's literally nothing there
[0:38:39] <leith_aziz> So MK
[0:38:40] <%Sparkseid> good decision, Reggie
[0:38:41] <%Konquerer> opening song is great though

[0:38:44] <fuji_92> look at this DIO kicking a puppy
[0:38:48] <+ManimalCrackerss> its Very Clearly A Fetish Thing because of how much they focus on it
[0:38:49] <%ZweihanderSteve> yo but have you seen those vector crafts SeemsGood
[0:38:51] <Tampaoster> Did someone here whatched mnemosine?
[0:38:53] <heart_ablaze> again, redo of healer....
[0:38:57] <%RadDude6969> Dio killed a dog too
[0:38:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> look how fucked up this scene is of a kids torturing a puppy
[0:38:59] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu better yet has Woolie seen THAT panel from chainsaw man
[0:38:59] <PanicSwytch> Parasyte and Psycho Pass is good gore anime
[0:39:00] <Tennochief> Chainsaw Man is fucking awesome
[0:39:00] <%mattwillpost> Meaning? No, LOOK AT IT.
[0:39:00] <nicversus> Yeah I bought some bootleg elfen lied dvds from Chinatown in toronto when I was in high school and it nearly put me off anime forever
[0:39:01] <leith_aziz> Yep, EXACTLY Mortal Kombat
[0:39:01] <+EdenOfLove> jojo literally has a puppy die in the first episode
[0:39:02] <heart_ablaze> never watch it
[0:39:08] <%paladinstarbuster> Its a horror anime
[0:39:08] <enerkaizer> Elfenlied is pretty much a proto-typicall early 2000s anime/manga before the Tv censorship laws got stricter
[0:39:08] <%DkLordG> the opening song is the only thing of substance
[0:39:08] <+EdenOfLove> and you love jojo
[0:39:08] <+NocturnePsycho> i never watched higurashi, is it any better than elfen lied?
[0:39:11] <+Stupid121v2> Its like the author is playing in blood, and not the character lol
[0:39:13] <leith_aziz> (Sorry I just hate the gore of that game)
[0:39:15] <user_naim> I like the jojo censorship shadow. Adds to the scary in a way
[0:39:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> you know
[0:39:18] <deviljhojho_> she gets it super hard
[0:39:19] <viciousgrim> redo of healer  is hentai right?
[0:39:21] <YaminoRaiden> @edenoflove different context
[0:39:23] <+hazardousmidget> Elfen Lied is an edgelords wet dream, its everything their parents told them wasnt good for them lmao
[0:39:23] <+Nitro4life2> @EdenOfLove this
[0:39:24] <asdief_> I murdered your parents cuz love, elven lied suck
[0:39:25] <srv4254> when dogs die in jojo its fucked but cartoonish compared to elfen lied
[0:39:26] <%dreadedcthulhu> @jamox1 there's a LOT of That Panels in chainsaw man
[0:39:26] <+Dova573> comics or show?
[0:39:27] <%X2Eliah> @EdenOfLove they didn't fetishize it so much tho
[0:39:28] <amiavamp> @NocturnePsycho they're not even in the same league lol
[0:39:29] <%Asuterisuku> The Boys is... consistent with that.
[0:39:29] <marvel877> That one bad guy in Digimon kicking that puppy.
[0:39:29] <Murdercles> the Amoral creative space is a valid and interesting to explore as the Moral space
[0:39:36] <leith_aziz> To be fair with JOJO, that just makes you hate the villian
[0:39:38] <Trigon_Trey> the boyz comic is waaaaaaaay worse
[0:39:38] <ralphfromdk> The boys is half satire in how hard it goes.
[0:39:39] <%ZweihanderSteve> @nocturnepsycho i'd say so
[0:39:39] <%paladinstarbuster> higurashi is signifugantly better than elfen lied
[0:39:40] <%Lion_kun> Boys is edgelord garbage.
[0:39:41] <whiteblacklight74> what did i walk into
[0:39:42] <+Hawk_Rush> The Boys' opening is super good with that
[0:39:43] <fuji_92> @viciousgrim it isnt but it tries so hard to be, that it might as well
[0:39:43] <RealDurdyDan> The Boys comic was full of gore
[0:39:48] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu very true! The astronauts one
[0:39:52] <jorniev> so stupid
[0:39:53] <heart_ablaze> @viciousgrim basically, but with no consent
[0:39:53] <+eanscrale> Shot her with style
[0:39:56] <leith_aziz> That is story, so you can judge it
[0:39:58] <peachy996> Kung Fu Hustle
[0:39:59] <%L3m0nTwi5t> The Boys has been a pretty good show
[0:40:01] <meganicmp3> gore for gores sake is garbage :)
[0:40:01] <+HowIPendragon> The Boys reminds me of Powers. Edgelord AF
[0:40:04] <%mattwillpost> Turns out the evil dude is evil
[0:40:05] <%LCLSmoothie> show good, comic bad for the boys
[0:40:06] <%Seancicle> brb afk skooku2POG
[0:40:06] <%dreadedcthulhu> THAT is a good spread @jamox1
[0:40:09] <algi80> hi all PrideLionHey
[0:40:09] <+nabs2099> @viciousgrim It looks like it but I don't think it is. Besides it's just an edgelords incel fantasy more than anything which is just bleh
[0:40:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will not to discuss a villain killing a dog, but that is a thing people are talking about lately *cough*
[0:40:19] <MyNameIsRasus> yo sexy nun girls are alright
[0:40:19] <%DkLordG> @whiteblacklight74  someone asked how he feels about Elfen Lied
[0:40:19] <RealDurdyDan> Kimiko is waifu
[0:40:20] <twoto858> That was dumb
[0:40:22] <leith_aziz> Absolution is so weird
[0:40:22] <+Stupid121v2> Is Madoka Magica edgy?
[0:40:23] <pixel_river> That was so effed up
[0:40:23] <Trigon_Trey> gore porn is trash
[0:40:24] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu one of my favorite manga panels
[0:40:25] <peachy996> Nathan's got a great song
[0:40:27] <MyNameIsRasus> not the gore shit tho
[0:40:30] <Garry_Guyface> louiseyPain
[0:40:31] <brunoberserk> WutFace
[0:40:32] <+Javaa01> Absolution is real bad
[0:40:33] <%Halospaz117> What did No More Heroes do to deserve getting compared to Hitman Absolution
[0:40:35] <amiavamp> @Stupid121v2 no
[0:40:36] <%Wulfphelz> Gore just for the sake of being edgy is so lame and it's easy to tell when something is just to be edgy
[0:40:36] <%Lion_kun> I hate the boys because it's so one note. Everyone in this universe is a dickbag, we get it.
[0:40:37] <rytisone> weird flex but ok
[0:40:40] <%Exiliator> I think it's more of how different people are affected differently by all things
[0:40:40] <%Halospaz117> Fuck Hitman Absolution
[0:40:42] <leith_aziz> Weird that we dont talk about this Mortal Kombat

[0:40:51] <%dreadedcthulhu> @jamox1 i could honestly gush about chainsaw man for hours
[0:40:51] <user_naim> oh fuck i forgot about absolution
[0:40:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> That Absolution trailer looked fucking awesome though...
[0:40:55] <huskarl_zap> Now tell me about serbian film
[0:40:56] <+Zeroblazex> Reminds me of Redo of healer. The absolute worst thing I’ve ever seen
[0:40:58] <%JaseAdrift> MK9
[0:40:58] <%RadDude6969> @stupid121v2 I'd say it's more existential than edgy
[0:41:00] <deviljhojho_> gore, sexy= sore
[0:41:01] <ghostravens> what do you think about devilman: crybaby?
[0:41:02] <+TheotherKristian> Alright, I looked at Elfen Lied
[0:41:03] <Prevot> sounds liker game of thrones
[0:41:03] <frostyjay3> @fuji_92 This is true as shit
[0:41:05] <exnuart> hitman absolution is what got me into the series
[0:41:07] <%L3m0nTwi5t> woolieONEGUY
[0:41:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:41:08] <+Zeroblazex> It’s borderline torture porn
[0:41:10] <jamox1> @dreadedcthulhu it’s very cool
[0:41:11] <DragonSpooker> I was not ready for Elfen Lied at 13
[0:41:11] <Jaysky> Senseless violence for the sake of it. Look at this puppy get beat for the sole purpose of making a character more DEEP
[0:41:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> kink shame the torture porn
[0:41:13] <%paladinstarbuster> Woolie just cant handle gore
[0:41:17] <exnuart> the nuns felt out of place in game
[0:41:20] <GhoulishCripple> Nathan Copeland is the low end of the spectrum because NMH is filled with that level of wanton violence being played as almost a tired trope
[0:41:20] <Sternieliscious> Hitman Absolution was so bad that most of the staff was replaced for Hitman 2016. Incidental dialogue writers did the 2016 game.
[0:41:21] <deviljhojho_> those kids had it coming
[0:41:24] <pixel_river> LUL

[0:41:34] <jorniev> FUCK THEM KIDS
[0:41:34] <ghostravens> "Fuck them kids" - Woolie Madden, 2021

[0:41:36] <KetsuoTaberu> Yep
[0:41:37] <YaminoRaiden> 4 of them were brainwashed.
[0:41:37] <Bisquick_Bunny> Redo of Healer is just glorified revenge porn
[0:41:38] <leith_aziz> Aside from V3
[0:41:39] <+Stupid121v2> Remember when that guy fucked Junko's body
[0:41:40] <glass_marcus> I too wanted to push the button
[0:41:40] <+Hawk_Rush> HE WAS THE COOLEST GUY
[0:41:41] <+nabs2099> oh they GET OFF ALRIGHT
[0:41:43] <Prevot> "but we can kill guilty children, right?"
[0:41:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Pride500 this was the first game I ever platinumed as a kid. Really excited to see y’all play it. The game was written by Paul Dini, one of the main writers on the animated series. It’s also partially inspired by Grant Morrison’s Arkham Asylum graphic novel. Lots of comic references
[0:41:44] <%X2Eliah> OBITO IS THE COOLEST THO
[0:41:44] <+skyheys> lmao
[0:41:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> thAt LP was real bad.
[0:41:45] <nicversus> Theme of Sad plays and all is forgiven
[0:41:46] <enerkaizer> Woolie channeling his inner Pat LUL
[0:41:46] <deviljhojho_> THE COOLEST GUYS
[0:41:46] <rosemon5001> explain something as a gore fetish and not appreciating the art but whut eva
[0:41:48] <%paladinstarbuster> They were children being manipulated by literally the greatest manipulator
[0:41:48] <AstrodropGaming> Woolie says "Fuck them kids"
[0:41:48] <+bearwagon> nah pham its different moral systems or some bullshit idk
[0:41:53] <jamox1> THE COOLEST GUY
[0:41:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie Jordan:  "Fuck them kids."
[0:41:57] <+eanscrale> less animation than the game apparently
[0:42:00] <Gamingc00l> we don't talk about that
[0:42:01] <%Exiliator> Eh, maybe
[0:42:01] <dundore77> one is literally a serial killer with 50+ kills, before they get to the school. Nothing happens
[0:42:01] <Torgue_1> What was Woolie talking about?
[0:42:02] <+Neerb25> everyone in Danganronpa is too dumb to live
[0:42:03] <%X2Eliah> Btw Batman is just Obito.
[0:42:03] <%LastHazzerd> or you could just say danganranpa sucks
[0:42:04] <leith_aziz> I would say its the Anime which just ruins stuff
[0:42:07] <amiavamp> @Stupid121v2 madoka magica gets construed as edgy because people who haven't watched it only know the one famous scene
[0:42:09] <%Wulfphelz> No shit woolie LUL
[0:42:09] <+Zeroblazex> People give goblin slayer the shock value treatment but redo is just the worst

[0:43:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> Berserk tho
[0:43:22] <bitterpelican> Jojo part 8 super does that tho
[0:43:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Jojo is cartoon gore AT WORST
[0:43:22] <rosemon5001> literally does but  oky
[0:43:22] <%paladinstarbuster> Akira does
[0:43:22] <%patriotrenegade> GET HIS ASS
[0:43:22] <amiavamp> But what if Dio was on the camera tho
[0:43:23] <jorniev> it did though
[0:43:24] <+WizoSavage> Jojo is gruesome but it isn't super gory
[0:43:25] <Chichen> comparing JoJo to that is INSANE
[0:43:26] <%Exiliator> Welllllll
[0:43:26] <+Stupid121v2> Gore us allowed to exist, its about the author PLAYING IN BLOOD
[0:43:26] <huskarl_zap> Unless its a dog
[0:43:27] <GhoulishCripple> jojo manga did zoom in on burning dog corpse
[0:43:28] <leith_aziz> But yes, its one or the other
[0:43:28] <DelgotHansto> You think JOJO is bad?
[0:43:29] <jorniev> THAT HAPPENED
[0:43:29] <+Nitro4life2> Jojo it's too busy focusing on junk
[0:43:31] <brian_peppers1> That brian guy has some stuff going on
[0:43:31] <alvaroeltz> If there is gore, it is ONE PANEL
[0:43:31] <Lancaster_H> it does though
[0:43:32] <passserby> also jojo violence means almost nothing when they fully heal in like 55 panels later
[0:43:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie is right and he should say it
[0:43:33] <meganicmp3> let them know son
[0:43:34] <crash400> You don't fight the mentally ill in arkham asylum.
[0:43:36] <user_naim> WoolieStaresAt our dumb opinions
[0:43:36] <+FuqBoiSlim> Jojo is like a 6 on a scale of 10
[0:43:36] <fuji_92> GET HIM
[0:43:36] <+runegod20> it's not jerk off edge gore
[0:43:37] <+skyheys> THERE'S THAT ONR TIME
[0:43:38] <whiteblacklight74> The thing JoJo superfocuses on tends to be the homoerotica
[0:43:38] <leith_aziz> I get you
[0:43:41] <mdkcde> Jojo's violence is not Erotic ONE GUY
[0:43:42] <%Exiliator> I think there is, but you dont noticed it
[0:43:43] <meganicmp3> go off
[0:43:43] <Stewbedale> the difference is the tone
[0:43:44] <%Asuterisuku> Jojo doesn't fetishize it.
[0:43:46] <+ConAirOnDVD> There's gore and then there's torture porn
[0:43:48] <MyNameIsRasus> The mental gymnastics of this dude
[0:43:48] <NoireRequiem> Jotora did smooch that one nurse
[0:43:48] <DatAsuna> OVA iggy got it so hard
[0:43:48] <+TheotherKristian> Jojo does like killing dogs
[0:43:49] <deviljhojho_> the jojo gore is loony tunes stuff half the time and 80s horror the rest of it
[0:43:49] <velgaduere> no thanks
[0:43:50] <ralphfromdk> Plenty gore, but the artist doesn't have a wank to it.
[0:43:51] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Berserk isn't even as bad as Elfen Lied
[0:43:51] <Alejandroxciv> nakedness and violence together oh no
[0:43:51] <jamesthebrave> idk man there's some stuff in Part 3 and 4 that's kinda uhhhhh

[0:43:56] <leith_aziz> Yep, like MK
[0:43:57] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Guessing Woolie isn't a fan of High School of the Dead woolieGIRLS
[0:43:57] <enerkaizer> It depends what gets focused in that situation. But still, JoJos Gore level lead to the series only getting an adaption in the last decade instead of the early 90ies
[0:43:57] <heart_ablaze> both happen,but not at the same time
[0:43:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> I DO NOT WISH TO

[0:44:16] <meganicmp3> SPICY WOOLIE
[0:44:17] <prime_name> Man, I am digging Shin Woolie
[0:44:18] <Janzer_> stupid takes on the internet? whhhhaaatt
[0:44:19] <%Wulfphelz> Theres a difference of using gore for fear and setting up a scene, and using it for shock or making your story all about it
[0:44:20] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS WOOLIE RULES
[0:44:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCK THIS MAN
[0:44:23] <pixel_river> kill la killa kinda parodies that stuff
[0:44:25] <+BigBruthaThunda> now we must stop because kids are confused
[0:44:26] <seniormeatbox> MORE OF THIS WOOLIE
[0:44:28] <jorniev> JOJO DOESN'T Fetishize  GORE thats true
[0:44:28] <+lazygreenjerk2> people really riding elfen lied in 2021 majinoSkiip
[0:44:29] <dundunsun> SUCH A REACH TO COMPARE
[0:44:29] <leith_aziz> Your opinion: DAGA KOTOWARU
[0:44:30] <jamox1> Shin Woolie is fucking unstoppable
[0:44:30] <%jinking79> both characters have stand doodLUL
[0:44:35] <%Wulfphelz> LUL
[0:44:35] <fuji_92> yeah, the book goes OOF
[0:44:36] <+MightyDuckShoes> I remember JoJo having a graphic rape scene that actually did the job of being fucked up. I remember when that one guy in part 5 gets assaulted and me and everyone else watching felt bad for her. It was framed like horror, not titilation.
[0:44:37] <+BakiinPlaysStuff> I'm really enjoying the Woolie Vs Chat arcs this season
[0:44:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Not as good as Jojo... hot take
[0:44:38] <seniormeatbox> SHIN MEGAMI WOOLIE
[0:44:39] <nicversus> Agreed I don't even like Jojo that much, but at least all the violence is in service of a story with objectives and themes, and not just for the sake of the violence
[0:44:39] <MyNameIsRasus> WOOLIE KAI
[0:44:40] <GhoulishCripple> If Araki doesnt have a fetish for killing animals why does he kill a dog and or a cat in each part? they get brutal like in part 5
[0:44:42] <+JacknZack27> Yeah, Woolies super right
[0:44:42] <%JustToWatch> the only comparison to Jojo is the shitty stand ripoffs
[0:44:43] <%paladinstarbuster> COUGH berserk COUGH
[0:44:43] <mr_sups> Elfen Lied fans are in denial. Not even about the quality. But about what it even is.
[0:44:45] <glass_marcus> No Prisoners today
[0:44:45] <%Sparkseid> BR manga gets crazy
[0:44:46] <chll0ne> especially the manga
[0:44:48] <whiteblacklight74> can't we just stop beating around the bush and go straight to saying anime sucks
[0:44:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Battle Rotale=Fuck'Em Kids
[0:44:52] <huskarl_zap> Now, Beserk
[0:44:53] <+Damie904> I think that was just the era Woolie. hyper adult fetishistic stuff became the breakout hits.
[0:44:57] <super_harley_dude> Wooly versus edgelord love it
[0:44:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Linger
[0:44:58] <whiteblacklight74> this is what this discussion always turns into
[0:44:58] <+Undenizen> Y'know, since I became a taxidermist it's really taken the thrill out of seeing gore in media. I'm over it now.
[0:45:00] <TheWizardOfWordplay> punished woolie

[0:45:23] <+Ancopro> AoT kinda turned me off cause o gore but now apparently i'm missing the best shit ever
[0:45:23] <%Bluwizard21> Woolie they won't get it, they have their fetishes they will defend them to the last
[0:45:25] <DelgotHansto> Araki barely kills that many dogs look at an actual graph of all dog deaths
[0:45:27] <Jaysky> Is it just me noticing thje slight lag on Woolz camera?
[0:45:29] <%paladinstarbuster> Woolie you being grossed out makes it last longer for you
[0:45:30] <viciousgrim> so it's like gore in horror movie vs gore in hostel
[0:45:31] <%kullumanati> It’s the Last of Us argument? Are you moving the characters this way for a point or just being risky to say” look look did you see that”.?
[0:45:35] <+Stupid121v2> I try to be open minded about any manga but Elfin Leid is just so bad.
[0:45:37] <OldManDeckardCain> jojo does zoom in on both gore and man titty tho Kappa
[0:45:37] <leith_aziz> Nice !
[0:45:40] <pixel_river> nice
[0:45:42] <%Asuterisuku> I'm so happy I-No's back in the game but I still think I'm gonna play Giovanna.
[0:45:42] <%LCLSmoothie> nice
[0:45:43] <leith_aziz> THATS GOOD
[0:45:43] <amiavamp> The key difference between gore porn and effective use of gore is that one is shocking, the other is also emotionally shocking
[0:45:44] <%Wulfphelz> Araki literally says he uses animal deaths to help set up how a villian is the scum of the earth
[0:45:45] <@Menitta> IT DRUGS
[0:45:47] <rytisone> made by that evil guy from Evil Within 2
[0:45:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> STRIVE IS SO DELICIOUS
[0:45:47] <leith_aziz> Ive been a fan
[0:45:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IMO if gore and brutality turns you on sexualy.  You need psychological help
[0:45:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie has converted another person
[0:45:49] <+MrMediocrity> It's a question of irreverance; It's definitely fetishised to an extend in BR but that's meant to be a play on the fact society is fetishising the games
[0:45:49] <@Solidus_113> IT'S SO NICE
[0:45:52] <srv4254> stop the arguing and just watch bible black everybody
[0:45:53] <+Stupid121v2> Strive looks so good
[0:45:53] <%Asuterisuku> STRIVE IS DRUGS

[0:46:16] <+MightyDuckShoes> @leith_aziz  The lade that got killed by the Birther stand and the scene where Mistah stops a rape. Each scene makes sure to depict the event as being horrible. It doesnt try to throw some spicy shit.
[0:46:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Araki isn't the only one who uses Dog Death to show "villain", I just can't ttalk about the latest mainstream example

[0:47:13] <+MrMediocrity> better to ask forgiveness than permission
[0:47:13] <bitterpelican> One thing I just need to understand - are they going to do a separate movie-story for Strive or is it going to be a playable mode?

[0:49:22] <brian_peppers1> Thanks Brian
[0:49:23] <+samuraiknack> Why is it always Brian?
[0:49:23] <Grzy514> @frostyjay3 don't think so, this should be minute 0
[0:49:23] <%ZweihanderSteve> anime fans are hilarious
[0:49:23] <Kiryurules> JoJo's gore is meant for shock and horror
[0:49:23] <leith_aziz> Fuck Chocolatta
[0:49:25] <Manmush> m6kwD3
[0:49:25] <meganicmp3> my man defending his gore fetish live
[0:49:27] <ExpressNode> I'm actually reading part 4 right now
[0:49:27] <+Neerb25> When DIO kicks a cat into a million pieces it's half shock-horror half unintentionally hilarious. But no one's jacking off to it.
[0:49:28] <+cinder_chan> elfen lied is considered gurro?
[0:49:29] <%Noonoox12> Anything with naked lolis instantly loses
[0:49:30] <Clundy> Let’s get back to Woolie’s Shrodingers Urethra problem
[0:49:31] <TheWizardOfWordplay> how can this be safe for the people of Gotham?
[0:49:32] <Murdercles> he's not saying it is exactly the same, the point is that if you can accept some of the things in Jojo, you can accept some of the things in Elfen
[0:49:32] <Uncle_Christian> wooliePOYO
[0:49:32] <SophisticHades> wow people hating on a man named brian

[0:49:37] <Futurecity10> Cheer500 elfin lied fans are the kid in you computer class or anime club that dates the autistic girl who thinks she’s a vampire.  The same kid who tells you in the middle of a quiet classroom to watch high school of the dead because the titties are amazing
[0:49:40] <huskarl_zap> lol we've gone back 15 minutes
[0:49:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Boys COMIC IS THE SHIT

[0:49:55] <Nero270> Is Berserk closer to Elfen Lied than to JoJos based off of having those fixated scenes/panels? @WoolieVersus
[0:49:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie go take your piss out elsewhere
[0:49:58] <+Stupid121v2> Naked loli's are an immediate "NO" anyway
[0:49:58] <NoireRequiem> Berserk never wants you to jerk off to it
[0:50:00] <daniphofani> Why does chat egregiously bad takes against Woolie this week
[0:50:02] <+jiggy_snipe> @Murdercles he also said he didn't really like Elfen Lied's story or premise
[0:50:03] <+TheotherKristian> Jojo does not want you to masturbate to its gore
[0:50:04] <quamdunk> Berserk is in another realm
[0:50:06] <meganicmp3> the comic did not age well
[0:50:06] <rosemon5001> literally never lingers like you say but mkay

[0:50:28] <%X2Eliah> So why are so many Animes such creepfests?
[0:50:31] <amiavamp> When I write I make a point specifically to avoid edginess, even in horrible scenes
[0:50:31] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @daniphofani We need to drive him insane before he can enter the Asylum, apparently.
[0:50:33] <+johnnychopsocky> Let Woolie empty himself already, Brian!

[0:50:43] <%Lion_kun> I would argue the Boys is tasteless as well. Not as much as Elfin Leid but it has its lows.

[0:56:56] <+nightwing1936> it's not a remake it's a Remaster

[0:56:59] <joshujostar> nice original with nvidia effects
[0:56:59] <NoireRequiem> You punch people sober, like Yakuza Kappa
[0:57:00] <NewWillinium> I was expecting the Remake.  But I'm also fine with this.
[0:57:01] <+Masked_Hero_Lucky> Heck yeah, Bamham
[0:57:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Remaster, not remakle

[0:57:15] <disflipmat> Wait we're not playing Armored Edition on Wii U?
[0:57:17] <+GenesisKnight> SUBTITLES YES
[0:57:17] <meganicmp3> even his face is better in the original
[0:57:18] <%runegod20> i don't know why but all the different save files being a different batman headshot makes me laugh
[0:57:18] <%Halospaz117> This game still has one of the best looking default Batsuits

[0:57:19] <ralphfromdk> subs, not dubs LUL
[0:57:20] <+johnnychopsocky> Twitch wasn't prepared

[0:57:26] <DatAsuna> nice that it puts subs right there
[0:57:27] <+even_the_yuenglings> SUBS
[0:57:28] <%doomerskeletor13> The exaggerated swagger of a white billionaire
[0:57:28] <%Davos_Southway> Great game
[0:57:29] <joshujostar> asylum's still the best among three
[0:57:31] <%r0chelimit> Bat titties
[0:57:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Correct
[0:57:32] <+Neerb25> Arkham Collection is so sad, they really botched the lighting. But it's still playable if it's your only option (which on PC it isn't).
[0:57:34] <MyNameIsRasus> SUPER BLACK
[0:57:35] <%Halospaz117> I can see it tho
[0:57:36] <+TopTieramisu> super black

[0:57:37] <+Damie904> We can see it.
[0:57:38] <RyuuAoi> HOLY FUCK WE IN
[0:57:41] <Kiryurules> SUPER BLACK
[0:57:42] <@Solidus_113> Asylum is gritty as fuck
[0:57:42] <clack14> Super black
[0:57:43] <LordOfThePoultry> i can see it
[0:57:43] <+TechnoSyndrome> PC version looks so much better than the remasters
[0:57:43] <Mattais88> Bat Nipples
[0:57:43] <%Noonoox12> Darkest Africa
[0:57:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can also just adjust your TV
[0:57:44] <meganicmp3> darkest night
[0:57:44] <%Exiliator> Subtitles: "no"?
[0:57:44] <+Stupid121v2> Bracku
[0:57:45] <Sternieliscious> Gonna need those bat-nipples from Forever.
[0:57:45] <xdeathknightx> super black
[0:57:47] <seniormeatbox> SUPER BlacK?
[0:57:47] <brunoberserk> '' I am vengeance . I am the night.''
[0:57:49] <JZPotter> lighting is way better in the remaster, at least on PS4
[0:57:49] <%Halospaz117> DO I HAVE SUPER EYES?
[0:57:52] <%Halospaz117> oh
[0:57:54] <jorniev> that
[0:57:55] <+queaks> Never played this game
[0:57:56] <slandracon> You better be using a controller @WoolieVersus
[0:57:56] <clack14> darker than black super black
[0:57:56] <quamdunk> Da darkness
[0:57:57] <Jaxnos> yeah, on stream we see a gray bat logo
[0:57:58] <+hazardousmidget> I can see it
[0:57:59] <$dudedude55555> hard mode: turn off screen
[0:57:59] <NoireRequiem> Black noir dark
[0:58:00] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wow
[0:58:01] <jorniev> oh
[0:58:01] <+warlockwithapixie> uh oh
[0:58:02] <+GingerStrawhat> Remember Everyone Black is Violence!
[0:58:03] <%Asuterisuku> Make it good for you.
[0:58:03] <brian_peppers1> DAT OLED
[0:58:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> Too bright for us
[0:58:05] <+Reverend_Roscoe> PERFECT
[0:58:06] <amiavamp> Does the recording still wash out colors on his tv?
[0:58:07] <meganicmp3> darkness is spreading
[0:58:07] <+JacknZack27> I never liked how the later games moved towards more realistic bat suits.
[0:58:07] <Clundy> The fake hdr filter ruined the remake in places
[0:58:07] <%runegod20> it took me a second to notice it
[0:58:07] <$Gorotheninja> Cheer500 Hey Woolie and Reg, is it true that Black People have glowing eyeball weakpoints hidden on their bodies? I'm asking for a friend.
[0:58:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> huh
[0:58:09] <TheWizardOfWordplay> whole game will be in detective vision anyway
[0:58:10] <rytisone> tv probably has hdr on
[0:58:10] <orpleborple> i see bat nipples but where is the bat ass?!
[0:58:11] <+Stupid121v2> fuck us make it good for you
[0:58:17] <meganicmp3> that is alright
[0:58:17] <%Asuterisuku> Lighting is important in this game.
[0:58:18] <GroundControl138> up the tv brightness
[0:58:18] <%X2Eliah> @orpleborple below
[0:58:20] <dinnydanny777> What a sexy chest
[0:58:21] <Prevot> sounds like your tv is too dark then
[0:58:27] <user_naim> Fuck us, you do you
[0:58:27] <%KeiganOfAstora> You do you, we can adjust our TVs
[0:58:29] <marvel877> Is the tv's lighting set right?
[0:58:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> screen experience requiem
[0:58:30] <+queaks> Does this game have Batbutt?
[0:58:30] <Tuna_Can_0> @TheWizardOfWordplay this is the true way
[0:58:30] <%paladinstarbuster> turn up thetv brightness
[0:58:31] <DatAsuna> yeyeye tv calibration hours
[0:58:32] <pixel_river> batman is buff af in this game
[0:58:33] <NewWillinium> I *hate* this kind of Brightness test.   I can never tell what *they* mean by barely seen.
[0:58:33] <GhoulishCripple> we gotta hire Batman to help solve Reggie's hair
[0:58:33] <%X2Eliah> yeah super dark recordings are bad for youtube
[0:58:37] <whirly25> battities
[0:58:39] <andre11dr> Man im so tempted to just shit on everything bad DC did with Batman this past decade but ill hold on
[0:58:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> "about here" as in at the max LUL
[0:58:40] <Indigo_Automaton> As long as you can see it's cool
[0:58:41] <user_naim> Youtube darkens anyway right
[0:58:41] <+chiazam> THE COLOR BLACK IS IMPORTANT
[0:58:42] <RyuuAoi> Recalibrate your tv. Call Pat. MrDestructoid
[0:58:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> I always keep it at middle
[0:58:44] <+skyheys> ITS NEVER RIGHT
[0:58:44] <%Livelinne> Oppai shiaHug
[0:58:45] <whirly25> batitties
[0:58:45] <amiavamp> turn that shit up in Nioh
[0:58:47] <meganicmp3> i hate reading
[0:58:47] <%X2Eliah> Like a lot of black and near black areas are BAD on youtube vids
[0:58:49] <+Willdog1993> He has to "Perfectly Calibrate" his TV
[0:58:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> DEFINE BARELY
[0:58:51] <fuji_92> woolieKICKDAD_BW
[0:58:52] <dinnydanny777> But that setting is always wrong though
[0:58:53] <exnuart> anime viewers gonna get the better experience
[0:58:54] <ZE_Count> WHOAAAA THE DEATH NOTE LP
[0:58:56] <+RiverKing13> Woolie needs get GeekSquad to adjust his tv settings
[0:58:57] <@Solidus_113> Brightness settings are bad 90% of the time. Capcom only has the good tests now
[0:58:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> fucked
[0:59:03] <+evbites> Yeah my tv has that problem
[0:59:03] <+Neerb25> Brightness up so the chat doesn't get scared. Spooky asylum game.
[0:59:04] <DelgotHansto> Bat Crotch
[0:59:06] <@akuda_bar> also colors are subjective
[0:59:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> fair enough
[0:59:07] <jorniev> who cares ITS JUST gonna BE SKELETONS 90% of the game
[0:59:10] <orpleborple> i wanna see things - Reggie Gaston
[0:59:18] <+Javaa01> @Solidus_113 And even their brightness test kinda blows for HDR
[0:59:19] <%Asuterisuku> It gets worse when you factor in HDR.
[0:59:19] <ContainsSodium> Bat Gooch
[0:59:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wonder if I should boost the gamma or brightness on Control so things stop sneaking up on me
[0:59:21] <+samuraiknack> This is Why Pat has a perfectly calibrated TV
[0:59:21] <ShadowArcangel> I like my games dark so I generally just go with the default and ignore it and may change it later
[0:59:22] <RyuuAoi> The more you know
[0:59:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Brightness all the way up for x-ray vision
[0:59:25] <mattdaddyd101> yeah i hate words to reggie
[0:59:26] <caffeinatedboy> Woolie dropping that knowledge
[0:59:27] <+vaderxyz1970> I play on Potatoe
[0:59:36] <+nabs2099> @jorniev LMAO true. the Arkham games never fixed the over reliance on detective mode
[0:59:38] <peachy996> Oh yeah it's impossible to stay out of Detective Mode
[0:59:39] <%ValentineWolf7> @Solidus_113 what does Capcom do different in terms of brightness settings?
[0:59:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> no
[0:59:42] <+even_the_yuenglings> the arkham games are so good
[0:59:43] <dinnydanny777> Play on the CRT someone dumped around the corner that you took in
[0:59:44] <Kiryurules> WE IN
[0:59:46] <%runegod20> I feel like generally you can go a bit brighter than they recommend and be good
[0:59:48] <%Asuterisuku> Skip Origins.
[0:59:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Arkham Origins!!!!
[0:59:49] <@Menitta> Origins between Knight and City

[0:59:51] <LordOfThePoultry> LTES GOOO
[0:59:51] <%cache_22> I just wish Brightness, Contrast, and HDR were all set well at a system level.
[0:59:51] <A_CD_By_Thomas> This opening's so great.

[0:59:54] <rytisone> City Origins Knight
[0:59:54] <%runegod20> origins is between city and knight
[0:59:55] <+Javaa01> Origins is a pseudo prequel to this
[0:59:55] <%Halospaz117> Origins then Knight
[0:59:55] <+Reverend_Roscoe> CITY IS GOOD
[0:59:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> origins first then knight and knight still sucks
[0:59:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Origins is a peequ
[0:59:56] <KnightAsteran> Origins is a prequel
[0:59:56] <frostyjay3> And a 3DS game
[0:59:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and then Knight because we don't acknowledge Origins
[0:59:57] <Darren716> Origins is a prequel that came before Knight
[0:59:57] <+spardanwarrior> Asylum, City, Origins, Knight
[0:59:58] <quamdunk> Wahhhhht
[0:59:59] <+queaks> Numbers are good
[0:59:59] <+Stupid121v2> This first hour is stellar
[1:00:06] <super_harley_dude> I had that problem back in the day with re2 og
[1:00:06] <PanicSwytch> ORIGINS IS GREAT
[1:00:07] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  don't forget Blackgate for Mobile
[1:00:07] <NoireRequiem> origins is a prequel
[1:00:07] <whiteblacklight74> bam ham assylum
[1:00:08] <marvel877> Origins, BY A DIFFERENT DEV TEAM, then Knight.
[1:00:09] <seniormeatbox> Origins is good, watch the cutscenes of blackgate
[1:00:09] <@Menitta> AND THE 3DS GAME
[1:00:09] <%Exiliator> Na-na-na-na-na Batman!
[1:00:09] <Dave_VD> This is a cool game. Haven't revisited it since I was a kid
[1:00:10] <Murdercles> which is the one where Joker becomes a stupid hulk?
[1:00:12] <datara90> its a very good series
[1:00:14] <%Asuterisuku> This is a trilogy.
[1:00:15] <peachy996> If you have any appreciation for Bane you will not skip Origins
[1:00:15] <dinnydanny777> So this is about that guy from Devil May Cry right?
[1:00:16] <meganicmp3> arkham babies was underrated asl
[1:00:17] <@Solidus_113> @Solidus_113 In their newer RE Engine games, they have in-depth settings for max and min brightness, along with contrast and gamma
[1:00:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Asylum, City, NOTHING, and then Knight
[1:00:17] <+hazardousmidget> Origins is not good
[1:00:18] <bitterpelican> Chronologically it's Origins, Asylum, City and Knight with tie-in comics, I think???
[1:00:18] <jorniev> INTRO IS SO GOOD
[1:00:19] <+PerrinIsDead> This game is SO good
[1:00:19] <+TechnoSyndrome> it was very much "oh this game was popular, work Arkham into every title"
[1:00:22] <%Asuterisuku> Asylum, City, Knight.
[1:00:23] <DatAsuna> oh boy the batmobile
[1:00:24] <meganicmp3> THIS INTRO
[1:00:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus This game is based off the Grant Morrison graphic novel of the same name
[1:00:24] <quamdunk> Great series
[1:00:27] <DelgotHansto> This game made people confuse Gotham City and Arkham City like they both exist
[1:00:27] <wibbwobbler> but it's a city
[1:00:28] <NoireRequiem> just an island
[1:00:28] <amiavamp> This looks a lot like SH: Homecoming
[1:00:29] <LordOfThePoultry> YEYEYEYE
[1:00:29] <DatAsuna> I sure wish 60% of the game was that
[1:00:29] <+shootbang_exe> yeah city kinda stretched it and with knight it was kinda laughable imo
[1:00:30] <frostyjay3> I have just been informed that the 3DS game was called Blackgate
[1:00:30] <%X2Eliah> LOOK AT THIS BATMOBILE
[1:00:31] <+queaks> He caused that car to crash>!!>
[1:00:31] <+nabs2099> Arkham Asylum, City, Origins then Knight let's goooooo
[1:00:33] <GhoulishCripple> Arkham Asylum. where Arkham spanks your butt
[1:00:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Caught him again.
[1:00:34] <%Feralspirit41> The greatest joker voice right here
[1:00:35] <Ipsenscastle> this batmobile is so much cooler than the one we got
[1:00:36] <Uncle_Christian> MAYBE  ESCAPIES
[1:00:36] <TheChapyGuy> Asylum, City, Origins (prequel), Knight. Origins isn't great, but you can play it for yourself
[1:00:37] <%X2Eliah> NO BULLSHIT TANK, ACTUAL BATMOBILE
[1:00:37] <+johnnychopsocky> For real, Arkham Origins gets more hate than it deserves
[1:00:37] <Prevot> LUL
[1:00:37] <amiavamp> actually Downpour*
[1:00:38] <+Reverend_Roscoe> NO
[1:00:39] <Manmush> LUL
[1:00:41] <+skyheys> lol
[1:00:41] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Man I haven’t played this since it came out

[1:00:44] <seniormeatbox> HAMIL
[1:00:45] <xdeathknightx> But that is only if you play the right version of the game ;)
[1:00:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> does this game have extra costumes?
[1:00:45] <NewWillinium> Riddler Trophies are the worst things in the trilogy
[1:00:45] <%krispen_wa> woolieONEGUY
[1:00:45] <%Asuterisuku> MAAAAARK
[1:00:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> There was a 3DS game?!
[1:00:47] <+hazardousmidget> even Rocksteady denies it a place in the arkham collection nowadays, they only sell the three good ones
[1:00:48] <+Neerb25> You can tell Arkham Origins is by a different developer because it's the only one where the title isn't a literal thing in the game.
[1:00:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MARK THE MAN
[1:00:50] <jorniev> maaark
[1:00:51] <%Halospaz117> MARKING OUT FOR MARK

[1:01:10] <Tracazoid> Kevin Conroy and Hamill always kick ass
[1:01:10] <chainsaw105> its all about the Joker? what is this, the New 52?
[1:01:10] <DatAsuna> But also Rocksteady LIED every time and said every sequel wasn't about him lol
[1:01:11] <meganicmp3> even in knight it's about the joker

[1:01:48] <bitterpelican> Hamill is great and all, but we need the best Joker in next game - Tommy Wiseau
[1:01:48] <%Asuterisuku> Blind in one eye, scars across his face, they clearly have history.

[1:02:31] <bitterpelican> Kevin Conroy is on par with Simon Templeman from Legacy of Cain in terms of that commanding strong voice
[1:02:31] <andre11dr> I'm pretty sure they bring the cast back to voice everyone in Injustice
[1:02:32] <Lancaster_H> fuck i love mark hamill

[1:02:35] <+Stupid121v2> oh fuck that is that KOTOR voice lmao
[1:02:35] <NewWillinium> Is it just me or does Arkham Asylum have that kind of look where it almost feels like someone put vaseline on the screen and tried to clean it up?
[1:02:37] <+even_the_yuenglings> is that guy in the clone wars?
[1:02:38] <DatAsuna> bad news about that mr mayor

[1:06:15] <+skyheys> WB doing shit for specific cards
[1:06:15] <+retro_godfather> it's like how you have to lower your cores to play Lost Planet 2
[1:06:16] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> I played this game on a WHITE 360, what the fuck is wrong with the PC version? The console overheated and shut down way more often than the game itself crashed
[1:06:16] <huskarl_zap> Nvidea will never surpass 980 gtx ti KEK
[1:06:16] <@Solidus_113> Physx isn't always optimized, it's always been bad and can't be brute forced

[1:06:33] <alvaroeltz> Please leave this in the anime
[1:06:33] <meganicmp3> hell yeah
[1:06:34] <thatangryguyofde> oops big problem
[1:06:34] <%SainEdge> @WoolieVersus  a lot of older games now have problems with physics, because they use old versions. Mirrors Edge for example LUL

[1:06:53] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:06:54] <%Asuterisuku> This is Nvidia's fault, not Artesian's.

[1:06:55] <Uncle_Christian> Dejavu
[1:06:56] <dinnydanny777> I love the Nvidia logo LUL
[1:07:00] <%runegod20> I'm reminded of Grimm Fandango, where if your computer was strong enough, a puzzle in the game would be broken because the game is too fast, which forces you to underclock
[1:07:01] <Estwilde> Nvidia drivers probably mess up the old PhysX libraries
[1:07:01] <meganicmp3> its fine
[1:07:02] <velgaduere> Artesian Builds SWEATING LOUDLY
[1:07:04] <%Kriss1827> @woolieversus just like in yakuza cart racing, too much power
[1:07:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOUR NEW BETTER VIDEO CARD IS SHIT AND YOU CANT PLAY
[1:07:05] <PWNMAKER> The PS4/One remasters are so bad
[1:07:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> How could artesian do this?
[1:07:05] <YaminoRaiden> @SaiyanShoto you gotta be fucking me? WB games SUCK on PC
[1:07:06] <Adwark> PhysX was specific tech of older Nvidia GPUs, not surprised that after years of progress of tech there are issues with handling old versions of it.

[1:08:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> 2000 - 2010 was huge
[1:08:40] <+cursedwithadhd> so is this whole thing because the remaster isn't playable on PS5

[1:16:48] <LunarRemix> Not even 10 minutes in
[1:16:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> AMAZING

[1:17:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HES THE BEST
[1:17:07] <enerkaizer> you can clearly tell how much fun Hamill had doing the voice work here
[1:17:09] <%Asuterisuku> The moment that Batman is no longer by his side, he's loose

[1:17:22] <brachydios777> Time to FUCK
[1:17:23] <Minerslovegames> And that's the original VA for Harley Quinn too, from the animated series.
[1:17:23] <%dreadedcthulhu> @smortypuffin the doctor undid them
[1:17:23] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s not Tara Strong actually
[1:17:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> no wait its not tara here yet
[1:17:24] <PKSomething> this game is a good reminder that yeah, the joker actually is a good villain
[1:17:24] <thelonechris> This is probably my favorite interpretation of the Joker
[1:17:24] <+queaks> Does joker have like twice as many teeth?
[1:17:24] <%Halospaz117> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Nope, Arleen Sorkin
[1:17:25] <RyuuAoi> @bitterpelican Welcome to Joker
[1:17:27] <DomonTrigger> Not Tara Strong yet
[1:17:27] <%X2Eliah> BAMHAM PUNCH HAMS
[1:17:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pinball time
[1:17:29] <gunsrlove> Just kill him already
[1:17:32] <dan_g_v> time to not kill all these innocent people
[1:17:32] <NoireRequiem> punchy time
[1:17:33] <NewWillinium> Welcome to the Arkham Games.  Where **everyone** is bult like a Brick Shit House
[1:17:36] <AncelDeLambert> c'mon, Woolie, get that combo
[1:17:36] <velgaduere> Tara Strong isn't Harley until Knight
[1:17:37] <Minerslovegames> Arleen Sorkin, that's it! @Halospaz117 thank you
[1:17:38] <pepinillomaton> slap slap slap slap
[1:17:39] <alphalejandro> Bat Woolie and the Reggie Wonder
[1:17:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @gunsrlove LUL
[1:17:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> dropping combos
[1:17:39] <DomonTrigger> Tara Strong doesnt start voicing Harley until the next game
[1:17:41] <@Commando_Joe> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli they kept her original cartoon VA for the first game, but she was out of practice so she was replaced by Tara in 2
[1:17:41] <%Asuterisuku> Don't mash the button. Hit it once, then see where he goes.
[1:17:41] <@Solidus_113> the Flow Combat System
[1:17:42] <deviljhojho_> not bad
[1:17:42] <+Radkon> XXXY time
[1:17:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @halospaz117 yeah i forgot she voices harley in the second game onwards
[1:17:44] <+Mkingston> OMG the LP is happening.
[1:17:48] <wendigo172> Is that OG Harley’s VA or?
[1:17:49] <+Boner_Girl> Joker's had practice
[1:17:49] <+samuraiknack> That is Arleen Sorkin
[1:17:49] <Tuna_Can_0> those are some punchy ass punch sounds
[1:17:51] <RoboticRexkek> bats point
[1:17:52] <peachy996> Yeah this Harley is the last Arleen Sorkin
[1:17:53] <DomonTrigger> She retired from the role after Asylum
[1:17:54] <uncledoodsauce> already woolie doesn't have the high score
[1:17:54] <hamahiroyuki> reminded of dark knight comic batman. now that was a W I D E batman
[1:17:56] <Gorotheninja> ROYAL GUARD!!!!
[1:17:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> I mean Harley is in the security office
[1:17:58] <AncelDeLambert> the OG rythmic combat system
[1:18:00] <%LCLSmoothie> s l a p
[1:18:02] <Minerslovegames> They switch Arleen out for Tara Strong in Arkham City and onwards.
[1:18:10] <wibbwobbler> oops
[1:18:11] <RoboticRexkek> the sound design is great in this game
[1:18:13] <Darren716> I mean they explain that they all come from Blackgate
[1:18:13] <seniormeatbox> TAra wasn't able to do asylum iirc
[1:18:14] <Reveresao> We have to make sure they see the easter egg for Arkham city guys
[1:18:14] <Jaysky> The counter animations are sick
[1:18:15] <lonosi55> What difficulty
[1:18:15] <doomerskeletor13> Arleen retired
[1:18:15] <%runegod20> it's refreshing to hear a harley that isn't tara from time to time
[1:18:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Wait for indicator
[1:18:15] <NewWillinium> Who is playing at the moment?
[1:18:15] <thelonechris> So when does Batman fight Mr. Shakedown?
[1:18:15] <jorniev> docens DOCENS I SAY
[1:18:20] <+skyheys> ass creed fight
[1:18:23] <dinnydanny777> Not dead btw
[1:18:24] <+FuqBoiSlim> The combat system that western action games shamelessly copied for a whole decade
[1:18:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its a rhythym game
[1:18:25] <OldManDeckardCain> tbh, I thought that this lp was just a bait and woolie would just make a let's watch of death note to mess ith pat LUL
[1:18:28] <Kiryurules> RIDER KICK
[1:18:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Remember Batman doesn't kill people
[1:18:33] <%kewlmyc> After playing Spiderman, I forgot how slow this first Batman game feels combat wise
[1:18:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its literally just a rhythm game
[1:18:33] <%Exiliator> Yeah kick that air!
[1:18:34] <DatAsuna> from 3 onwards it got a lot more arkham
[1:18:36] <deviljhojho_> yeah cycling them is usually the best choice
[1:18:36] <jorniev> BATMAN KICK
[1:18:36] <%Mrthefro> Whiffing a counter breaks combo IIRC
[1:18:36] <emeraldskrull> i can't decide if  i want to manga or anime this...
[1:18:38] <+Story_Ark> i know its aged now but back in the day, this game was sooo dope.
[1:18:38] <%doomerskeletor13> I think Arleen got some kind of cancer and retired
[1:18:40] <TheWizardOfWordplay> it's black flag combat
[1:18:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> Cuz of this game
[1:18:40] <peachy996> It's weird at first but when you get used to it, you are Batgod
[1:18:41] <DSD24> This is the Shadow of Mordor System
[1:18:42] <%AnthroMetal> Batman doesn't kill anyone
[1:18:43] <iamtheTwitchghost> prince of persia sands of time had it first
[1:18:43] <dustworthmain> this combat system has been copied so many times now
[1:18:44] <bitterpelican> The sound design for punches is just perfect
[1:18:44] <Uncle_Christian> Tara is bland
[1:18:44] <+MightyDuckShoes> Ooh! I love Sploderman!!
[1:18:44] <dinnydanny777> Kicked in the head unconscious
[1:18:47] <NoireRequiem> had counters in city were so sick too
[1:18:47] <Darren716> Yeah every game in the 360 gen ripped off this game's combat
[1:18:48] <+gustavozxd> arkham knight's combat gets pretty tough
[1:18:49] <DelgotHansto> Batman kills 0 people this game
[1:18:50] <@Solidus_113> Asylum was the first
[1:18:50] <%HollowedIdjit> @oldmandeckardcain that would have been the best
[1:18:54] <TheBensonator_> How to be Batman, step 1: do combo
[1:18:55] <deviljhojho_> brain damage doesnt count as killing so its fine tomatoSmile
[1:18:56] <seniormeatbox> @DSD24 More or less Mordor took thisd
[1:18:57] <crowned_martian> god I remember playing the Demo on PS3 and being absolutely blown tf away . this is next gen gameplay!
[1:18:58] <RyuuAoi> Does it feel like Ghost of Tsunami? KappaClaus
[1:18:59] <+shootbang_exe> lmao is wb gonna patent batman combat next
[1:18:59] <SaiyanShoto> Arkham combat is just Spider-Man 2 combat
[1:18:59] <YaminoRaiden> Any whiff button is an instant combo dropped
[1:19:00] <NoireRequiem> *hard
[1:19:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> Spiderman combat
[1:19:05] <coreybom> @kewlmyc Makes sense in canon. Spiderman is a FAST son of a bitch.
[1:19:07] <exnuart> spiderman ps4 combat
[1:19:11] <Minerslovegames> Combat system in this is so crisp.
[1:19:13] <Jaxnos> it BEGINS
[1:19:16] <%Pillagius> Aaactually one of the very first cases of such "soft lock on" combat I can remember was Matrix: Path of Neo
[1:19:18] <JZPotter> Conroy must have had a cold during recording this, he sounds off for a lot of it
[1:19:19] <StarlitStunner> stripGo Bat time brother @deviljhojho_
[1:19:19] <%Asuterisuku> Don't leave this room yet!

[1:19:34] <slandracon> READ THESE @WoolieVersus
[1:19:36] <alvaroeltz> Read the item lore

[1:19:38] <StarkAvKnark> Reggie lore master
[1:19:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the second game onwards didnt have comic art
[1:19:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> including everything that happened in Gotham the showo
[1:19:39] <peachy996> And these designs are wonderful
[1:19:39] <prime_name> That's a real detective coat
[1:19:40] <%runegod20> wasn't aware there was unique art like that, Gordon's looking like an extra fine Sigma
[1:19:40] <KgKid51> drip?
[1:19:40] <Punareff> i love the character art in this
[1:19:41] <Gorotheninja> Arkham basically homogenized 3d action combat
[1:19:42] <bitterpelican> @pillagius Which is surprisingly a GREAT game for what it was
[1:19:42] <Prevot> that's good art
[1:19:43] <hazeprojekt> Just Remember Batmans right arm is bigger than his left in all the arkham Games
[1:19:44] <alphalejandro> James "Big Boss" Gordon
[1:19:45] <ZE_Count> what facts
[1:19:45] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Surprised they never tried these in the following games.
[1:19:46] <%robo_trunk> Super Nice Bio Art
[1:19:46] <$eco419> Yeyeyeyeye
[1:19:48] <jorniev> art is pretty good

[1:19:52] <frostyjay3> @vaderxyz1970 Hay man brutally beating the shit put of criminals to the point of doing life threatening damage to their bones and organs, etc is definitely NOT killing people.
[1:19:52] <%JaseAdrift> oooooh art
[1:19:53] <dinnydanny777> That art is sick
[1:19:54] <wendigo172> @jzpotter he sounds off in all the Arkham games
[1:19:55] <deviljhojho_> the art in these was real solid
[1:19:56] <Komayeda> First Appearance
[1:19:56] <mr_sups> I wish that the In game art matched this art.
[1:19:56] <crowned_martian> Batman Arkham Asylum, Sleeping Dogs, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spiderman 2018 yeyeye boy those were the good days

[1:24:24] <%L3m0nTwi5t> woolieONEGUY
[1:24:24] <+Ghufufin> comic is good they might be referring to the terrible movie they made of it
[1:24:25] <RealDurdyDan> One man army
[1:24:26] <%kewlmyc> Maybe the movie does, but the comic was great
[1:24:26] <BlackermanZX> kiling joke ruined robin thats for sure Keepo
[1:24:26] <+Story_Ark> the only bad thing about killing joke is the movie
[1:24:26] <mdkcde> BRIAN!, It was YOU AGAIN?
[1:24:28] <brachydios777> The point is that the origin isn’t clear it’s real
[1:24:28] <jorniev> one guy talking about the animated movie probably
[1:24:28] <heart_ablaze> one REALLY WRONG guy
[1:24:29] <DatAsuna> Killing joke itself was good, people say that because of the years of killing joke wannabe writers
[1:24:29] <prime_name> I think they might be talking about the animated thing
[1:24:30] <alvaroeltz> Stop incentivizing one guy
[1:24:32] <SpoonJuggler> Killing Joke is to this day the only comic I've ever bought. It's great.

[1:24:49] <Dante_Namikaze1> That guy is wrong
[1:24:50] <Indigo_Automaton> So basically any prison warden
[1:24:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wait until we get to Hugo Strange, still waiting for him in the movies
[1:24:51] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s Alan Moore’s opinion on Killing Joke, he wishes he had never written it now
[1:24:51] <peachy996> He's basically Chilton from Silence of the Lambs
[1:24:52] <DatAsuna> It's like how Watchmen ruined deconstruction of superheroes.

[1:33:21] <thelonechris> I'm pretty sure he's dying right now

[1:33:22] <A_CD_By_Thomas> This fucker.
[1:33:28] <+johnnychopsocky> GOTHAM Zsasz is best Zsasz
[1:33:30] <+b_aleph> Say Zsasz backwards, I dare you!!!

[1:33:31] <dinnydanny777> Sucks for that guard I guess
[1:33:32] <BlumpyLumpkins> fun fact: this scene breaks if you pirated the game, and people went to official forums to complain, accidentally outing themselves as pirates

[1:33:38] <%kylejefferies> just got in, who's on controls?
[1:33:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolies worst enemy STEALTH
[1:33:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the villain was Harley Quinn trying to take over the city when she was back to being half sane

[1:38:16] <NumbF4ke> Isn't Harley dating Ivy in comics now?
[1:38:19] <+itsgundamu> Zaz is 150 pounds wet
[1:38:20] <SpoonJuggler> First appearance is actually Animated Series
[1:38:21] <Gorotheninja> I wish the bio also listed things like :
[1:38:21] <%BronxSpyder> i guess comic apperance
[1:38:21] <%krispen_wa> SHE STARTED ON THE SHOW
[1:38:21] <frostyjay3> Damn 140 okay!! Love to see it
[1:38:21] <%Kaito_Cam> @WoolieVersus she was created from the animated series
[1:38:22] <meganicmp3> she a thottie
[1:38:22] <%mihokspawn> She was invented for the Animated series
[1:38:23] <heart_ablaze> first appearance was on TAS
[1:38:24] <+nightwing1936> that's her fist comic appearance, she was in the animated series first
[1:38:24] <snakest3alth> She appeared in BTAS
[1:38:26] <%paladinstarbuster> she is from theshow
[1:38:26] <SeruraRenge> The one character that was 100% original to the animated series, and she was voiced by a friend of the show's creators that has a really unique voice
[1:38:26] <+MightyDuckShoes> @KyoryUtchy  And Batman did what? Say No?
[1:38:27] <TheCrispyBoi> TAS made her
[1:38:27] <Jaysky> Harley is MORALLY GRAY
[1:38:29] <%Sparkseid> BTAS was her first appearance
[1:38:29] <+GenesisKnight> She was created for the Animated Series
[1:38:29] <+discognition> She originated on BTAS
[1:38:30] <Dante_Namikaze1> She was on the show first then in the comics
[1:38:33] <+maxteammagus> Started on the show
[1:38:34] <joshua_42> Ivy and Harley are dating I think
[1:38:34] <Shardlab> Full transplant from the show. Harley can get into your head and make you do what she wants.
[1:38:34] <Joestar1890> animated series was at 92 I think
[1:38:35] <+duskrush> she came from the cartoon
[1:38:35] <mudamudajo> She was created in the animated series, THEN brought to the comics.
[1:38:36] <fuji_92> she appeared in TAS before the comics
[1:38:37] <Minerslovegames> Her first appearance in comic form. She actually first appeared in the Animated Series and was ported over into official canon because of how popular she was.
[1:38:37] <slandracon> She was invented in the animayed, same with Freeze
[1:38:39] <marvel877> TAS first, then comics in 99.
[1:38:42] <+captain_history> they are only listing comics here
[1:38:44] <%Grimlockfly> She was created on the show
[1:38:44] <Uncle_Christian> Gaggy, also known as Gagsworth A. Gagsworthy, was the Joker 's original sidekick.
[1:38:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Ye they wanted her and Ivy to have a relationship in the animated show but obviously couldn’t because of censors
[1:38:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> The original Harley IS the Animated Series, she was canonized into the comics because she was popular
[1:38:51] <dinnydanny777> Isn't 140 lbs kind of heavy for a gymnast?
[1:38:51] <+NickHatesSnow> she did
[1:38:53] <+Xero_J> @kyoryutchy I mean....if that’s the case, why not just make the technology public anyway?
[1:38:55] <Adwark> Actually her first appearance was back in 1992 in animated series.
[1:38:55] <+Zeroblazex> No she totally did

[1:39:00] <%JaseAdrift> She did
[1:39:01] <+mars_driver> She did.  Animated series first, that was her first COMIC appearance.
[1:39:01] <Torgue_1> Yep
[1:39:01] <DatAsuna> @NumbF4ke HarleyxIvy has been a thing in the comics since like 2001
[1:39:01] <+JumboCrunchies> That may be her first *comic* appearance?
[1:39:01] <AncelDeLambert> that issue came out AFTER the animated series episode
[1:39:01] <nvst4rk> She did appear on BTAS first, comic debut was after
[1:39:02] <huskarl_zap> THICC GYMNISTS
[1:39:03] <+spardanwarrior> Bingo
[1:39:03] <+retro_godfather> yeah prob first comic appearance
[1:39:03] <GGHorror865> Nah she did
[1:39:04] <GhoulishCripple> animated series was before 1999
[1:39:06] <brachydios777> Comics in 99
[1:39:07] <prime_name> Man is that attributes page out of date
[1:39:07] <%runegod20> wouldn't that comic have also came out when the animated series ended already?
[1:39:08] <hikkiari> it's listing comic first only
[1:39:09] <wibbwobbler> yea
[1:39:11] <Estwilde> I think her first comic appearance is 1993. Im not sure why the game lists 1999
[1:39:12] <%Halospaz117> Yeah thats right
[1:39:14] <samuelfisk> You’re right, Woolie.
[1:39:15] <%HollowedIdjit> First Comic, yeah
[1:39:15] <Ghostbody> Calm down chat, he got there eventually
[1:39:17] <+skyheys> it only counts comics for some reason
[1:39:19] <user_naim> wierd listing for sure
[1:39:31] <andre11dr> I do like how they explain later that she was a terrible doctor and that's why it was so easy for Joker to manipulate her
[1:39:34] <%ozzrabbit> She’s a Animated Series Original
[1:39:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Are you gonna play Arkham City or Arkham Knight?
[1:39:41] <peachy996> By the way Woolie does Oracle sound familiar to you? It's Ash from Mass Effect
[1:39:43] <mdkcde> The comic is from 1999, it's SUPER Wrong
[1:39:44] <+Javatron69> fun fact, an episode of the animated series also inspired the entire plot of batman begins
[1:39:47] <%Exiliator> Yeah I think the game is wrong on this one
[1:39:51] <@Menitta> Remember how Suicide Squad won an oscar
[1:39:52] <+JustBlubs> "How do you know?" "I just do."
[1:39:52] <spacechannel4> Did pat like this game, chat?

[1:40:04] <%krispen_wa> actual psychiatrist = not very bright
[1:40:06] <+condemned_15> Animated Series was early 90s. That comic was late 90s
[1:40:09] <majindusto> She totally  was Cartoon  first
[1:40:10] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Tbf, she's the only character I can think of where it makes a difference
[1:40:13] <SeruraRenge> Batman Beyond's entire setting existed as a cartoon before any comics were made as well
[1:40:17] <NoireRequiem> The noises are nostalgic now
[1:40:19] <%Asuterisuku> That vent up there is pretty sus
[1:40:19] <+MightyDuckShoes> A DOCTOR, HONEY
[1:40:19] <Jaysky> @Menitta Did it actually? That's just sad.
[1:40:20] <alphalejandro> Money is a superpower

[1:40:50] <+Story_Ark> although i wouldnt say harley is a new character when its been...sorry to say....almost 30 years

[1:41:18] <%jonblnt> Detective vision kinda breaks the art direction

[1:46:20] <BlackermanZX> batarangs do solve everything
[1:46:21] <%slayabee> Literal arrows on the ground
[1:46:22] <dukenux> It solves ALMOST everything
[1:46:23] <@Solidus_113> some kind of metroid blocker
[1:46:24] <samuelfisk> Soul of a Disenfranchised Citizen
[1:46:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> You have a map if you ever need it

[1:46:30] <TheWizardOfWordplay> metroidvania
[1:46:37] <Safarihat> oh hai mark hamil

[1:46:55] <cj_art> for you
[1:46:56] <zedravan> oh no the coomer
[1:46:57] <Onehandstan> the fapmaster

[1:47:02] <Indigo_Automaton> HAHA
[1:47:02] <+Firststrike_OW> LUL
[1:47:02] <DatAsuna> Here it is: the worst part of the game
[1:47:03] <SixthSun2> LUL dodged into the attack
[1:47:04] <+JumboCrunchies> boink
[1:47:04] <+skyheys> SLANGIN
[1:47:05] <+hazardousmidget> Reggie shocked
[1:47:06] <joshua_42> COOMER
[1:47:06] <elshadow7> The exposed spine seems like a pretty bad weakpoint tbh
[1:47:08] <Tuna_Can_0> atpRtsd

[1:47:19] <%patriotrenegade> Is that Amygdala
[1:47:23] <@Solidus_113> rocked by the L4D2 charger
[1:47:25] <+PerrinIsDead> ya can actually use the battarang to stun during charge
[1:47:29] <gunsrlove> Actual abhuman mutant, Batman is actualyl doing him a favor by killing him
[1:47:30] <alvaroeltz> Hes going to take to understand
[1:47:31] <+Undenizen> So, Woolie. I hope you enjoy this boss fight because you're gonna be seeing a LOT of it.
[1:47:31] <velgaduere> no iframes here
[1:47:36] <mr_sups> Yeah stock roar sfx
[1:47:36] <brachydios777> Oof
[1:47:36] <NoireRequiem> joker as majima art is something i'm shocked to not have seen yet
[1:47:39] <dinnydanny777> why is this funny LUL
[1:47:39] <$Spydurman> Woolie he's like a Shakedown
[1:47:39] <frostyjay3> I don't believe in backdating so Imma just tell you to , "punch it son!"
[1:47:40] <Jaysky> And so ends Batman.
[1:47:41] <+Rekinsinn> Mr Shakedown over here
[1:47:41] <%mundanelotus> Hope Woolie sees a lot of the death screens
[1:47:43] <ThatGuyThere03> AOE ground pound confirmed
[1:47:46] <penitentpendant> Oof, the pity
[1:47:50] <Prevot> time for easy mode
[1:47:53] <Adwark> An enemy with one weirdly muscled arm and other one noticeably smaller... Hm... curious...
[1:47:53] <InfiniteAverage> worst part of the game
[1:47:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> actually sometimes, Batarang does work on them, dizzies them, especially when they charge at you
[1:47:54] <$hattrick61> FOX DIE
[1:48:01] <%X2Eliah> EASY MODE IS NOW UNLOCKED
[1:48:02] <SheefEatsBeef> FOX..... DIE!!?
[1:48:03] <hikkiari> you can't lose this fight. he just dies if you beef it
[1:48:09] <peachy996> Heart Attack
[1:48:13] <deviljhojho_> lmao he almost went for it
[1:48:14] <Alejandroxciv> the feeling of the punches in yakuza compared to this is...
[1:48:14] <dukenux> DO IT
[1:48:14] <AnacondaVirtue> Do it, dipshit
[1:48:17] <amiavamp> just do it
[1:48:20] <%krispen_wa> DO IT DAMN YOU

[1:48:24] <whiteblacklight74> no batman does not kill
[1:48:24] <jorniev> JUST GRAPPLE HIM
[1:48:24] <Depthcharge2030> dew it
[1:48:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> JUST SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM
[1:48:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> JUST DO IT
[1:48:25] <+even_the_yuenglings> DO IT COWARD
[1:48:26] <some_brave_apollo> Batman is a bad person
[1:48:28] <Estwilde> Batman is complicit. He won't do it
[1:48:29] <+queaks> END THIS HUMAN
[1:48:30] <%dreadedcthulhu> do it no balls
[1:48:31] <BlackermanZX> GRAPPLE HIM COWARD
[1:48:32] <clack14> do it bussy
[1:48:32] <+Story_Ark> that is kinda dumb tho. just knock him off then save him
[1:48:33] <marvel877> Did he unlock Easy Mode already???
[1:48:33] <AncelDeLambert> Batman could've saved a shitton of lives RIGHT THERE if he had
[1:48:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> No Bat Grapple allowed LUL
[1:48:35] <mudamudajo> What did you think was gonna happen when you tossed the batarang the first time bats?
[1:48:37] <+Diamond_Dynamo> More like Cowardman, amirite
[1:48:38] <armchairmaster_> Batman is a bad person confirmed
[1:48:39] <%Wulfphelz> GODDAMN IT BATMAN
[1:48:41] <Shardlab> This ain't Jason. He won't kill him
[1:48:42] <brian_peppers1> YEYEYEYYE
[1:48:43] <+kewlmyc> I get Batman doesn't kill, but goddammit it Batman
[1:48:46] <+gustavozxd> batman killed a few hundred people by not killing him there
[1:48:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @alfredfromthedusk
[1:48:50] <+Walopoh> Batman just looked if there was a way to do it by just KO'ing him
[1:48:52] <Jigokuro> !uptime
[1:48:52] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 49 minutes
[1:48:53] <+Zeromaru2> Jason Todd
[1:48:54] <@Solidus_113> UPGRADE
[1:48:55] <%bread_assassin> At some point, Batman's responsible for Joker's crimes.
[1:48:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Slow mode is too slow
[1:48:56] <%Halospaz117> Did you say: Jason Todd?
[1:48:57] <nvst4rk> it's just Jason tho
[1:48:58] <%Asuterisuku> And then they get bodied because it's the Joker.
[1:48:59] <+Fenrein> Jason was right
[1:49:01] <%jiggy_snipe> has Jason tried?
[1:49:02] <+chiazam> TO KILL OR NOT TO KILL
[1:49:03] <+AnthonyJMax> Jason Todd
[1:49:04] <%Deekman> break his spine lol
[1:49:04] <diontmack> dub tech
[1:49:05] <coreybom> So chat are a bunch of punisher fans then.
[1:49:05] <Th3rd3> upgeade time!!
[1:49:06] <Gorotheninja> Jason Todd/ Red Hood
[1:49:09] <+JaseAdrift> Yes become the law and just start murdering people
[1:49:09] <TheWizardOfWordplay> inverted takedown first
[1:49:10] <%patriotrenegade> paralyze him
[1:49:10] <GroundControl138> jason did nothing wrong
[1:49:11] <DatAsuna> Says superman
[1:49:13] <+Zero_Jacks> flashback of Static shock - counter shocking joker
[1:49:13] <+Nekros4442> Jason was right
[1:49:13] <astrophizz> Azrael
[1:49:15] <%LCLSmoothie> everyone in gotham : JUST KILL JOKER / batman: nahh
[1:49:15] <journeytogetgood> Huntress also
[1:49:18] <NewWillinium> "I'm not talking about Harvey, or Penguin, or Riddler. I'm talking him, just him. . . ."
[1:49:20] <PanicSwytch> JASON DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:49:20] <Jaysky> So Red Hood. Jason is absolutely right to do so, then Batman gives him a lecture.
[1:49:22] <NoireRequiem> they try killing him and get killed hard, or get proven wrong
[1:49:23] <dinnydanny777> Batman needs to punch people in the back of the head repeatedly until they fall unconscious
[1:49:25] <ThatGuyThere03> and the punisher did that too in a crossover comic
[1:49:25] <Blank9> Why not cripple him?
[1:49:25] <+GenesisKnight> It's not Bruce's job to be executioner. Take it to the courts.
[1:49:26] <StarlitStunner> Prometheus and Hush
[1:49:29] <Tuna_Can_0> just break his legs, kinda hard to commit crimes in a wheelchair
[1:49:31] <OllieMan_XIII> as recent as a few months ago. in the comics, Harley tried to convince him to kill him.
[1:49:34] <%paladinstarbuster> Batman admits he's at fault but he knows that if he kills him then he wont stop.
[1:49:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or Damien Wayne
[1:49:40] <joshua_42> Break his spine
[1:49:42] <alphalejandro> Jason was a victim...of Batman
[1:49:43] <alvaroeltz> Its my sponsor
[1:49:44] <velgaduere> uhhhhhh BAT-TECH
[1:49:47] <gunsrlove> Just surgically remove his arms, legs and tongue and leave him in a hole.
[1:49:52] <SeruraRenge> goddamnit now I'm thinking of the /co/ meme where Gordon keeps trying to get Batman to rape the Joker if he won't kill him
[1:49:53] <brachydios777> It’s a thing
[1:49:53] <Darren716> I think he has both
[1:49:53] <+condemned_15> Wayne Enterprises
[1:49:54] <Exodusprime1256> he litterally blew up an orphanage and stabbed children. just do it
[1:49:59] <$emptyantics> RED HOOD had every right to kill Joker
[1:50:01] <glass_marcus> Wayne World
[1:50:01] <CommanderCOOL> Lock up was a villian in Batman TAS that scared the crap outta all of the baddies
[1:50:02] <penitentpendant> Important Note: You don't have to do these 'in order' look through them before commiting
[1:50:04] <%BronxSpyder> yes, become the law and start beating people in ways that normally would kill people
[1:50:06] <fuji_92> Wayne enterprise
[1:50:07] <+AnIrishPapaya> I mean letting someone live only goes so far. After someone's murdered a few upwards of a couple hundred they're just human garbage
[1:50:11] <wibbwobbler> Bruce Wayne is gonna be pissed
[1:50:12] <+ChronoWave> You may be thinking LexCorp
[1:50:13] <%Exiliator> I mean I cant fully blame batman, he keeps handing Joker to the city right? Can't they just kill him then if they want to?
[1:50:13] <+skyheys> it has many subdivisions
[1:50:15] <+ClericOfSparda> in the new game there's an entire company Wayne Enterprises owns called Batman, Inc.
[1:50:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Do Combo.
[1:50:23] <@Solidus_113> there's more
[1:50:24] <$tallik44123> if he really cared the joker would have been lobotomized years ago
[1:50:25] <+chosenjuan42> Wayne Enterprise
[1:50:28] <%krispen_wa> the courts in DC are fucking stupid though. like literally the worst. theres a reason vigilantes exist in that universe.
[1:50:33] <AncelDeLambert> aaaaaaand mistakes were made
[1:50:34] <+JumboCrunchies> @WoolieVersus Wayne Enterprises is the overarching company, WayneTech is the tech side
[1:50:36] <+Diamond_Dynamo> There are more options unlocked already
[1:50:36] <+spardanwarrior> Nope
[1:50:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> Good choice
[1:50:37] <%X2Eliah> NO NOT IN SEQUENCE
[1:50:37] <%jepupu> The types are different though
[1:50:40] <Estwilde> Every person murdered or injured by the Joker is on Batman's hands. The regular world has already proven incompetent at containing the Joker.
[1:50:42] <3Xgilly> you dont need to do them in sequence
[1:50:42] <+NerevaRising> It's not in sequence
[1:50:42] <+ShutUpAceyP> there are a bunch you can choose actually
[1:50:48] <+Infernal_Dalek> Infernal_Dalek subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! You haven't seen Death Note!?
[1:50:48] <slandracon> scroll the list for upgrades
[1:50:49] <dundore77> theres more options
[1:50:49] <jorniev> Why is there no death penalty in gotham?
[1:50:50] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> NOOOOOOOOO, augh the lp tax is too strong
[1:50:50] <Komayeda> It's not in sequence
[1:50:50] <user_naim> Not all in sequence
[1:50:51] <marvel877> Mistakes were made already.
[1:50:51] <+chiazam> KEEP LOOKING
[1:50:51] <peachy996> There was more but you might as well get the throw now
[1:50:54] <LunarRemix> It's a not a sequence Woolie
[1:50:55] <+Weeewer> Woolie gon woolie
[1:50:57] <Doctadaking> Inverted Takedown is integral
[1:50:58] <+RyanTheRecluse> not all in sequence
[1:51:00] <brunoberserk> It's not in sequence
[1:51:01] <%Asuterisuku> It's NOT in sequence but you need to get some before you can get others.
[1:51:05] <+Javaa01> The DON'T BUTTON MASH upgrade
[1:51:07] <dinnydanny777> So how has Batman never accidentally killed someone

[1:51:09] <%runegod20> spiderman had that
[1:51:11] <SheefEatsBeef> Rhythm Punch!
[1:51:14] <gigamaid> Show me a person who killed Joker and didn't end up worse for it. Injustice Superman and Jason don't become angels after they off Joker.
[1:51:19] <%HollowedIdjit> If Progress was allowed to happen, Joker would have been executed and Gotham wouldn't be a shit hole
[1:51:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:51:23] <armchairmaster_> NOT IN SEQUENCE you can choose your powers in any offer
[1:51:23] <Indigo_Automaton> This game is all about flow and timing
[1:51:26] <@Solidus_113> when your fist connects to the enemy, hit the button again
[1:51:28] <+johnnychopsocky> you were not misled
[1:51:34] <Darren716> Inverted takedown is the shit
[1:51:35] <candidateplays> These Icons are really reminding me of Madworld
[1:51:36] <+supersparta12345> Not mislead. You just didnt look lol
[1:51:37] <alphalejandro> Wayne Tech...learn how to throw bad guys to the ground
[1:51:40] <whiteblacklight74> the inverted takedown is a gamechanger
[1:51:41] <TheWizardOfWordplay> do inverted takedown next
[1:51:41] <PanicSwytch> Not sequence! U can choose gadget, vitality or combat
[1:51:42] <+ScottishMadJacko> Inverted takedown is the best
[1:51:43] <OldManDeckardCain> killing joker - "meh"    killing random pedestrians with your batmobile - "hell yeah"
[1:51:44] <+even_the_yuenglings> inverted takedown is really good
[1:51:45] <+grbunnys> More combo meter if you hit on a rhythm
[1:51:57] <Onehandstan> the takedown abilities and gadget abilities are the funnest
[1:51:57] <mudamudajo> I'd recommend unlocking the combo stuff first. Special takedown will be paramount!
[1:51:59] <devanmuse> Get the inverted take down. It's one of the most useful skills in the game
[1:52:00] <+nabs2099> Alright I'm back. sorry guys but could anyone tell me what I missed in the last 30 mins?
[1:52:05] <$tallik44123> lobotomy still exist specifically for people like the joker
[1:52:12] <+LeaIsChill> It's his thing LUL
[1:52:14] <%krispen_wa> inverted or critical are worth
[1:52:15] <samuelfisk> Combo takedown
[1:52:16] <+Diamond_Dynamo> In later games, they lay it out more like a tree, which is more intuitive imo
[1:52:17] <CastellanVon> remote control batarang is so dumb but so fun
[1:52:21] <DSD24> Random Bullshit go!
[1:52:23] <+Javatron69> wasnt the mount batmans giant hand?
[1:52:24] <nvst4rk> Batarangs are a good fucking investment tbf
[1:52:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @gigamaid but your argument is that killing Joker is bad solely because someone wrote it to be bad for those people who already had such things in them
[1:52:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> @WoolieVersus Inverted Takedown is so good it became a default move in every other game after this one.
[1:52:33] <%nabby1> !motivated
[1:52:33] <@Moobot> 2076 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:52:34] <BlackermanZX> Remote control is so fun
[1:52:36] <pi_in_the_sci> remote control batarang is a puzzle solver
[1:52:37] <%Mrthefro> More moves>everything else
[1:52:38] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Inverted takedown is mega useful, too bad you didn't look i guess
[1:52:42] <+GlewmanIII> @tallik44123 personally I don't think we should justify any lobotomy
[1:52:46] <+condemned_15> NECA just put out a replica of the Batman 89 Batarang. Walmart Timed Exclusive
[1:52:48] <%X2Eliah> @WoolieVersus Inverted Takedown is THE BOMB
[1:52:49] <rytisone> no shark repelent :(
[1:52:50] <%runegod20> isn't remote batarang used for some puzzles and stuff?
[1:52:52] <majindusto> IT WAS O EASY TO REMOVE  lol
[1:52:52] <user_naim> Inverted Takedown is stealth equivalent of Stinger
[1:52:53] <NeoseekerStitch> health
[1:52:54] <peachy996> It becomes less "Why don't you kill Joker, Batman?" and more "Why don't you just execute Joker, Gotham City?"
[1:53:09] <+Neerb25> Inverted Takedown! Be The Bat!
[1:53:19] <alphalejandro> Spiderman = Web, Batman = Batarangs
[1:53:21] <%Asuterisuku> All your attacks are Electrics, basically!
[1:53:23] <elshadow7> 3/237! Nice
[1:53:26] <@Solidus_113> the trophies are just exp
[1:53:26] <PatrickButler299> Isn't remote baterang mandatory in this game  tho?
[1:53:30] <SheefEatsBeef> yea no need to sweat on the trophies
[1:53:31] <DaKnightWarrior> Oh no. i'm late!
[1:53:35] <+Story_Ark> Steve?
[1:53:36] <@Commando_Joe> Is the death sentence illegal in whatever state Gotham is in?
[1:53:38] <Zebroneath> it's not super important to get them all
[1:53:39] <fuji_92> a billion of them
[1:53:40] <TheWizardOfWordplay> only do the riddles not the trophies
[1:53:41] <%ZweihanderSteve> oh hi steve blum
[1:53:43] <%HollowedIdjit> It is unbelievable how corrupt Gotham is
[1:53:46] <%spuddnyk> That face has not aged well
[1:53:47] <+johnnychopsocky> you get EXP, Woolie.  more punches
[1:53:49] <dinnydanny777> The faces behind those masks look so weird
[1:53:50] <coreybom> @hollowedidjit With Gotham, bruce tries to do as much as can as Both Batman AND Bruce. The city is just fucked. And Batman say kills the joker, whats to stop him from killing the others? They got Bodies too, A LOT of bodies.
[1:53:54] <%Kaito_Cam> it's spike
[1:53:55] <clack14> HollowedIdjit just like the real new york!
[1:54:00] <%SainEdge> getting 100 % is not bad in this game, but in the other games...oh boy
[1:54:00] <%krispen_wa> why doesnt a corrupt cop just kill the joker when he gets in custody
[1:54:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> Youtube exist so collectables are obsolete now
[1:54:03] <DSD24> Hi Steve Blum again!
[1:54:03] <CommanderCOOL> steve blum is everywhere in the batman games
[1:54:09] <amiavamp> @coreybom all I'm hearing is that nuance is too hard
[1:54:09] <+Walopoh> :)
[1:54:10] <Bazal68k> YOU have NEVER PLAYED Arkham Asylum???
[1:54:12] <MonstarGrrrl> silly joker
[1:54:15] <prime_name> No, I was expecting One Face
[1:54:15] <+samuraiknack> Gotham is haunted
[1:54:17] <+discognition> Mark Hamill!
[1:54:19] <alfredfromthedusk> the Steve Blum Everywhere System
[1:54:20] <+Robob00p> @commando_joe I don’t think but the main problem is they plead insanity
[1:54:22] <+Javatron69> you havent seen death note?!?
[1:54:23] <+Radkon> I always liked the way this game hinted at other big villains without actually showing them
[1:54:24] <+mechslayer71> So is this the original or the remake?
[1:54:27] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Uh oh.
[1:54:31] <%doomerskeletor13> DIRTY COPS

[1:54:46] <velgaduere> HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE INTERNET
[1:54:47] <MidnightSnack69> hamil is so good. joker is a true villain, but hearing hamil do the voice makes me very happy indeed.
[1:54:47] <+Firststrike_OW> D: anything but that!
[1:54:47] <peachy996> Riddler Trophies give more EXP, Actual Riddles give you backstories on other villains/characters
[1:54:48] <penitentpendant> He'd get... SO MANY VIEWS
[1:54:51] <BlackermanZX> Not my Balls D:

[1:54:55] <Depthcharge2030> No Joker! Not the Internet!
[1:54:59] <NoireRequiem> joker is yandere for batman
[1:54:59] <+even_the_yuenglings> I like how the riddler is a shitposter in the later games
[1:55:01] <radregice> LUL
[1:55:05] <+Undenizen> it IS the booze.
[1:55:05] <$hattrick61> NOOO JOKER, YOU POSTED CRINGE
[1:55:06] <disflipmat> Man Batman's always talking shit about how dumb other people are
[1:55:06] <Gorotheninja> Bowels is pretty dumb
[1:55:07] <%runegod20> @krispen_wa batman is the type of person where if a cop even considers doing that, he'd paralyses them for life first
[1:55:08] <bear_breaker20> joker uplaods to his myspace page
[1:55:11] <DaKnightWarrior> Sub to Joker.
[1:55:13] <coldfire0007> That place is evil
[1:55:13] <+SentaiGarm> joker's gonna go viral NotLikeThis
[1:55:15] <+Story_Ark> @midnightsnack69 hes the peak joker. he always sounds like hes having a blast recording
[1:55:15] <Manjove> Boles is a smoothbrain confirmed
[1:55:16] <%Mrthefro> Joker would be partnered on Twitch for sure
[1:55:19] <Exodusprime1256> he will post it in the 4chans
[1:55:19] <elshadow7> Oh boy, navigation...
[1:55:23] <theronhal> Batman's face in the remaster looks a little ugly. They gave him a giga chin
[1:55:28] <@Solidus_113> metroiiiiidddddd
[1:55:30] <%Asuterisuku> This game is a MetroidVania.
[1:55:32] <+johnnychopsocky> Kevin... Kevin.  That line read.  No
[1:55:34] <Prevot> "Joker has a heated gamer moment"
[1:55:34] <coreybom> @krispen_wa They tried. But there’s a reason why Joker has gone toe to toe with Bats.
[1:55:35] <TheWizardOfWordplay> metroidvania
[1:55:36] <+ShutUpAceyP> is reggie or woolie playing?
[1:55:36] <%X2Eliah> Oh yeah this is Metroid as hell
[1:55:37] <brunoberserk> BATROID
[1:55:37] <%sirisvirus> ya this is a metroidvania
[1:55:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's a metroid!
[1:55:39] <+Neerb25> I don't think Batman really needs an excuse to not kill Joker. He just doesn't want to kill and that's fine. Nobody has the moral responsibility to be the sole executioner of someone else. Batman already does more to stop Joker than 100% of the rest of Gotham does.
[1:55:41] <+Huttersson> This is a metroidvania.
[1:55:44] <+gustavozxd> "we live in a society" - Joker, actually
[1:55:53] <fuji_92> yeah this batman is metroid as heck
[1:55:54] <mrhappy6677> S e a r c h a c t i o n
[1:56:01] <+YharnamNighthawk> Batvania
[1:56:03] <%Lion_kun> PC PORT IS GREAT GUYS
[1:56:14] <SheefEatsBeef> i'm gonna put my cursor over it so it's like they're holding hands :)
[1:56:15] <user_naim> it’s a bat cursor
[1:56:21] <+MisterCrimson> I'm actually more surprised the other villains haven't killed Joker yet.
[1:56:21] <%jepupu> Teef are just a bit extra XP
[1:56:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> but he has win before
[1:56:26] <razieltano123> Frank BALLLS.

[1:56:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fronk.
[1:56:35] <+chosenjuan42> Batman returns fat bat is cool.  But Arkham bat is my favorite
[1:56:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Please don't use names on comms Oracle"
[1:56:42] <Sparda_blizzard> find the ballz
[1:56:45] <%C0baltCrusade> HE LOOKS JUST LIKE PUNISHER
[1:56:46] <Jaysky> Isn't this guy Lockup?

[1:56:54] <raikagelord1> Did I miss the Zsasz already?
[1:56:58] <+Story_Ark> arkham bat is the absolute best. great balance of comic and realistic

[1:57:13] <dinnydanny777> It's like the RE6 logo NotLikeThis
[1:57:14] <%krispen_wa> Joker is the worst holdout of 60s batman. he used to be about throwing pies and shit. now he's basically a school shooter that always gets away
[1:57:15] <NewWillinium> I always liked the Bright black bat on yellow.  Because that makes it a *target* that people will automatically aim for. So you focus the armor there
[1:57:19] <StarPupil1> Eh
[1:57:21] <+skyheys> dude what
[1:57:21] <%Halospaz117> SON OF A BITCH I SEE IT

[1:57:32] <%Asuterisuku> No my childhood
[1:57:34] <Gorotheninja> Thanks for the trauma woolie
[1:57:34] <@Solidus_113> Ben Affleck had a bad bat logo
[1:57:35] <disflipmat> wait what are we looking at?
[1:57:35] <+eanscrale> Oh that's why they changed it
[1:57:37] <%paladinstarbuster> two batmans kissing

[1:57:52] <chll0ne> what are we talking about
[1:57:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @krispen_wa because the 60s show made Joker and Riddler popular, Joker did die in the comics
[1:58:00] <%X2Eliah> SIX FEET

[1:58:37] <coreybom> @krispen_wa I mean, Joker was that BEFORE the 60’s. The 60’s, like a LOT of things, lighten him up.
[1:58:41] <+discognition> Luke Skywalker's best performance.
[1:58:43] <user_naim> So bad of a cop, he’s not really even a cop

[1:59:13] <Asuterisuku> Can you imagine if they just let the inmates drink?
[1:59:14] <majindusto> Oh so it says he's  original to this game...But Harley Quinn being from a Cartoon? NOoooooo

[2:03:52] <FrostedZaibatsu> Poly count doesnt mean much. Its the PBR that matters
[2:03:53] <%paladinstarbuster> Jumpsuit with makeup is way easier
[2:03:54] <+samuraiknack> Thats a rickety chair
[2:03:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> it's for PORN
[2:04:00] <alphalejandro> Good chair, not as powerful as Vergil's chair, but still a good chair
[2:04:01] <+evbites> city's harley is even more cosplayable
[2:04:02] <+discognition> Go into side room before heading up
[2:04:05] <UvBenServed> Maid Harley when?
[2:04:11] <TheWizardOfWordplay> Tara Strong herself cosplayed as her once
[2:04:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> the porn became stronger with that design
[2:04:22] <T_Sasquatch> new harley with the booty shorts is just low effort
[2:04:25] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie's costume just changed and he takes a minute to look at the chair.
[2:04:27] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Classic Harley would also be way harder to pull off live action without looking silly
[2:04:28] <+nabs2099> Knight Harley is genuinely her second best outfit
[2:04:33] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Oh it was, That Harley was everywhere... Still though City's Harley was her best costume though.
[2:04:34] <wibbwobbler> woolie gets it
[2:04:43] <velgaduere> there's SO much dialogue in this game
[2:04:54] <dinnydanny777> I want a Harley outfit that's less over the top like Joker's suit
[2:04:55] <peachy996> Yeah and I won't hold it against you if you get a little annoyed by it
[2:04:57] <dekkitout> How goes the Arkhaming?

[2:06:28] <devanmuse> Metroidvania? METROIDVANIA.
[2:06:29] <+PikeBot> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DEATH NOTE!?
[2:06:30] <BourneWarrior> METROID
[2:06:41] <+Superbro64> please emphasize that its ADULTS dressed as BABIES at least for fuck sake
[2:06:43] <%cache_22> Woolie LPs are cursed. First we have Bob the Clown and his "Compo" in Yakuza 0 and now sexy babies in Batman Arkham Asylum.
[2:06:44] <SolidusA> metroidvania much
[2:06:44] <hamahiroyuki> dafuq kind of shit hole school did you went wools?
[2:06:44] <+Mr_Pylon> ia
[2:06:49] <%slayabee> DPad?
[2:07:00] <Darren716> He doesnt have the upgrade yet
[2:07:03] <KaiserMario> "Woolie, you YOU haven't played Arkham Asylum?!" - Pat being "that guy"
[2:07:06] <+chosenjuan42> TIME STOP
[2:07:06] <+ClericOfSparda> @pikebot LUL I'm glad we'll all NEVER FORGET
[2:07:09] <+wanzerfaust> Level before what?
[2:07:15] <dukenux> he needs a Bat-explosive-thingy
[2:07:19] <Gorotheninja> "Metroidvania?" Woolie just got a boner
[2:07:19] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @youngking_kush
[2:07:22] <ShadowArcangel> Get ready to have that little jingle burned into your brain btw "dun-dun-dun-duuuuuun"
[2:07:25] <+evbites> Gud SHIMMY
[2:07:28] <MAX116030> Oh you didnt watch death note
[2:07:30] <dundore77> @hamahiroyuki hes probably referring to college. most "schools" don't allow sexy halloween outfits
[2:07:32] <+nabs2099> Pat was being ONE GUY
[2:07:32] <+TheTyper> I'd consider it Metroidvania-lite. The game's reaaallyyy guided. Very few areas are optional.
[2:07:42] <NewWillinium> Woolie: "Oh I get it now"
[2:07:43] <+Damie904> Good rule of thumb if you get stuck is use detective mode to point out stuff to grab or climb to.
[2:07:44] <$JamesCorck> Never would I thought I'd see the day, but here we are. I can check that one off the bucket list <3
[2:07:49] <+hazardousmidget> Hold A to run
[2:08:02] <Prevot> it's only this one, really. the others are open world
[2:08:04] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Tbh, other than the level ups, there isn't much Vania in this. It's mostly just Metroid
[2:08:07] <slandracon> This isn't DMC its Metroid @woolieversus
[2:08:07] <%runegod20> what fuck is that doing there for
[2:08:08] <peachy996> This is Metroidvania-like, the rest are open world
[2:08:08] <datara90> Is Woolie aware on the funny anti pirating this game had ?
[2:08:10] <alphalejandro> Oh this...thing
[2:08:11] <mighty_fine_trousers> Didn't this game have the problem of detective vision being too good?
[2:08:11] <+gnoame> Got that Bat-Trap going
[2:08:13] <prime_name> is it a blue beetle?
[2:08:14] <A_CD_By_Thomas> This shit's so cool.

[2:09:00] <+BananaSlammuh> These were neat
[2:09:00] <twoto858> Arkham's  a Lovecraftian name, is it not?
[2:09:01] <dukenux> This feels very Lovecraftian(you know, ARKHAM things aside)
[2:09:02] <brachydios777> Lovecraft shit
[2:09:02] <Joestar1890> OH BOY IS IT
[2:09:05] <Shardlab> I think Bruce is distantly related to this guy on his mother's side
[2:09:06] <+evbites> WOOLIE IT'S GOTHAM.
[2:09:11] <PKSomething> I
[2:09:13] <+condemned_15> Did you ever read the Arkham Asylum comic?
[2:09:14] <%Halospaz117> AYE
[2:09:16] <+SilverInferno3> Okay so this place is literally cursed???
[2:09:16] <AnneSQF> aaaaye
[2:09:17] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus It's named after Lovecraft, that shouldn't be surprising
[2:09:18] <+johnnychopsocky> Arkham's haunted *loads batarangs*
[2:09:18] <+chosenjuan42> Gotham stuff
[2:09:37] <+Neerb25> Fun fact: in comics the reason Gotham is so awful and spooky is because it's built on ancient cursed bat-god land.
[2:09:43] <+Javaa01> It ties in a little bit, but you can miss it and not lose much
[2:09:45] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Pretty sure the implication is that it's just the writing, not a literal ghost. I could be wrong though
[2:09:45] <%doomerskeletor13> This collectible is inspired by Grant Morrison’s Arkham Asylum story
[2:09:49] <Manmush> thats dumb
[2:09:51] <Depthcharge2030> Short answer: Ye. Long answer: Yes.
[2:09:52] <Shyguytvch> I've been hoping for this day.
[2:09:53] <+wanzerfaust> Batman punching his way across the room at them.
[2:10:00] <+PikeBot> A+X to throw
[2:10:04] <%AnthroMetal> not dead
[2:10:05] <+MattDemers> That "It's the Bat!" line is probably the main thing I remember from this game most vividly
[2:10:05] <+gustavozxd> @Neerb25 man that is DUMB
[2:10:16] <%Asuterisuku> Asylum's Haunted. Anyway throwing is good Crowd Control.
[2:10:17] <+Stormiercashew> where is calendar man
[2:10:18] <theronhal> those recordings were actually pretty fun to collect since I found them really interesting
[2:10:22] <hamahiroyuki> ye souls rolling
[2:10:22] <dinnydanny777> Don't think about how they aren't moving when the fights end LUL
[2:10:25] <+hazardousmidget> I love the sound design during the fights, every punch sounds so goo
[2:10:30] <anAngryHamster> Why is Woolie button bashing?
[2:10:33] <huskarl_zap> Miskatonic uni
[2:10:34] <+Mercening> They're knocked out cold.
[2:10:34] <%megaman_sentinel> Batman doesn't kill lol
[2:10:35] <penitentpendant> This game is very punishing for 'whiffs', you can pause a bit to line up your next hit but swinging at empty air instantly drops a combo
[2:10:38] <SixthSun2> Amadeus Amadeus
[2:10:39] <+Javatron69> are we going to show woolie the arkham city easter egg when he gets there
[2:10:48] <+LoVezineTheAir> let him play the game
[2:10:48] <%X2Eliah> @anAngryHamster Because he is a pro fighting game player
[2:10:49] <%Mrthefro> The more shit you throw into your combo the more xp you get woolieGASM
[2:10:49] <elshadow7> Can you do the slide into the vents in this one? Or was that later on?
[2:10:52] <+evbites> Gotham city just sucks so much that anything in it sucks
[2:10:57] <dukenux> Half-Life vents
[2:10:59] <@Solidus_113> monkaS guns
[2:11:00] <user_naim> @javatron69 i mean let’s not scream about it
[2:11:01] <Jaysky> Jump if you don't see a combo ready it extends it
[2:11:05] <SeruraRenge> also the city in Demonbane is Arkham
[2:11:05] <%runegod20> "Asylum's haunt? *loads batarang* "Asylum's haunted."
[2:11:10] <andre11dr> Ghosts are not even that weird in this universe
[2:11:17] <+Stupid121v2> Gotham itself is basically a stand that makes stupid shit just happen
[2:11:22] <brachydios777> In Earth 2 I think Martha Wayne was a Arkham
[2:11:23] <Treyu000> why put a gargoyle there?

[2:11:56] <+Story_Ark> If you think thats weird, batman was once "killed" by darkseid but instead sent through time where he became a caveman, a pirate, and others

[2:13:22] <dukenux> Joker is the shittiest boss ever
[2:13:23] <TreeLeafBoi> My when Batman turns my skeleton blue
[2:13:25] <+chiazam> JOKER SEES THIS
[2:13:26] <$QueequegTheater> Hi Luke
[2:13:26] <DumbNerdThing> really fun to wait and listen to the thugs' conversations before you take them down
[2:13:26] <+NumiiPlays> wow its happening and we are here to see it. time to let them see the jankiest jank. lol
[2:13:29] <SeruraRenge> Gotham only makes sense in a setting where Metropolis and Central City don't exist because it really raises the question of how the league lets it and Bludhaven stay that way
[2:13:31] <%Infernal_Dalek> Batman SUS
[2:13:36] <+NocturnePsycho> joker is just here for fun
[2:13:36] <+ShutUpAceyP> BATMAN vs SKELTONS!
[2:13:38] <Arancet> theyre your loading screens
[2:13:40] <NoireRequiem> JO
[2:13:42] <huskarl_zap> CHAOS. IS FAIR
[2:13:44] <velgaduere> y can't Batman morph ball??
[2:13:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> The most ludicrously oversized vents
[2:13:46] <Indigo_Automaton> Video Game Vents
[2:13:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> AMOOGUS
[2:13:50] <+taggerung403> vent maintenance must earn a ton
[2:13:54] <seniormeatbox> HOLY SHIT THEY ARE
[2:13:54] <+hazardousmidget> I LOVE  hamill in this game holy crap he sounds almost better tha he did in TAS.
[2:14:03] <+skyheys> BIDEOGAME ass video game
[2:14:06] <slandracon> This is a nice 1-2 night completeion game if everything goes smoothly
[2:14:07] <marvel877> They can't hear you with the vents, Woolie.
[2:14:09] <+wanzerfaust> Imagine Metroid, but Samus just crawls around real fast instead of morph ball.
[2:14:09] <brian_peppers1> Mark Hamill is sooooo goood
[2:14:12] <deviljhojho_> stealthy bat
[2:14:14] <thetrashman_sc> hey its this room
[2:14:21] <amiavamp> Here goes MGS 5 mode
[2:14:22] <twoto858> First combat room, let's see how woolie does
[2:14:24] <T_Sasquatch> @delgm woolie is playing LUL its not going to be
[2:14:25] <+Story_Ark> god i fuckin LOVE hamill. im so upset that movie joker is always gonna be the edgy dark joker
[2:14:32] <+mechslayer71> Oh yeah, the demo room
[2:14:33] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Imo, these games are Mark's best Joker performance
[2:14:33] <+gustavozxd> arkham games have a LOT of dialogue that most players won't hear most of them
[2:14:36] <peachy996> Yeah yeah yeah get into the Stealth.
[2:14:37] <dundore77> silently kick open a metal grate thats screwed into the wall
[2:14:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can do it twitch, load the video
[2:14:46] <%krispen_wa> THE REAL GAME STARTS NOW
[2:14:49] <+samuraiknack> Batman Beyond Return of the Joker is peak Hamill
[2:14:49] <%Asuterisuku> Welcome to your first Predator encounter.
[2:14:53] <rytisone> gargoyles are your best friends
[2:14:55] <jorniev> this is why i love the batman gaqmes
[2:14:59] <+condemned_15> He COMIN
[2:15:04] <dukenux> Yeah, Hammill definitely brought his A game here
[2:15:05] <anAngryHamster> This room was mind-blowing in the demo
[2:15:06] <coreybom> @serurarenge In fairness, where do think a lot of the criminals decide to go? The reason why the crime in somewhere like metropolis is more white collar and alien is because what dumbass is going rob a bank with supes around?
[2:15:07] <+evbites> The next level action joker needs to be the goofiest guy ever still murdery but actually funny
[2:15:08] <%Halospaz117> Glide kicks are loud
[2:15:10] <TheWizardOfWordplay> ground pounds are loud
[2:15:13] <BlackermanZX> bodied
[2:15:13] <$QueequegTheater> He's fiiiine
[2:15:13] <wibbwobbler> yes
[2:15:14] <+moink1234> just kneed his dick
[2:15:17] <@akuda_bar> do you think joker actually believes these guys will kill batman, or is them trying just part of the joke
[2:15:18] <%Infernal_Dalek> A non-stylin' takedown
[2:15:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> You can drop behind him and do a silent takedown
[2:15:23] <+CptBritches> Non-stylin takedown
[2:15:27] <+bearwagon> extweme?
[2:15:27] <Darren716> Certain knock outs will cause enemies to investigate
[2:15:28] <brachydios777> These are great
[2:15:30] <+Stupid121v2> If you pirate the game, doesn't it remove the Gargoyles and make this room unwinnable?
[2:15:35] <FrostedZaibatsu> I think one of the first videos i posted on youtube was just Batman t-baggin an enemy. LUL
[2:15:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...Failed the interview. Immediately.
[2:15:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEY INTERVIEWS
[2:15:40] <penitentpendant> And it was at this point it's as much fault the hiring process as hers
[2:15:41] <%kewlmyc> That's a red flag right there
[2:15:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> She was the best interview all day
[2:15:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> see?  NOT VERY BRIGHT
[2:15:50] <+taggerung403> playing the combat in detective mode only is a classic
[2:15:51] <seniormeatbox> big RED flaaag
[2:15:55] <A_CD_By_Thomas> These are pretty cool too. I don't really like that this version of Quinzel had the accent before she became Quinn.
[2:15:56] <+chiazam> She's always sounded like this
[2:15:56] <RyuuAoi> This is before she was psycho
[2:15:58] <DaKnightWarrior> The interviews are so good!
[2:16:00] <Calamity2007> Yay animated series reference
[2:16:00] <SixthSun2> Not sure how I feel about Harleen being somewhat off before meeting Joker
[2:16:06] <Prevot> that's her accent woolie
[2:16:06] <+Neerb25> Arkham probably doesn't have a whole lot of applicants tbf
[2:16:06] <+BusterRepukken> D A M A G E D
[2:16:07] <+Weeewer> she seems starry-eye'd
[2:16:08] <Gorotheninja> These are lines from the show
[2:16:08] <+FuqBoiSlim> Those interviewers really didnt give a fuck huh
[2:16:09] <%runegod20> yeah, I like her being a completely normal person before meeting joker, like TAS
[2:16:10] <alphalejandro> She was a loser
[2:16:12] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> She's allowed to have an accent
[2:16:17] <+Javaa01> Yeah this is just a case of botched VA direction
[2:16:20] <TallPixels> same voice actor though so i wonder why they did that
[2:16:22] <+chosenjuan42> It just her voice
[2:16:26] <+nightwing1936> Woolie Remembers right
[2:16:26] <%krispen_wa> This copies the dialogue right from the BTAS episode, but she didnt have the accent there
[2:16:27] <andre11dr> No it's dumb when she's professional
[2:16:28] <velgaduere> her origin has had slightly different takes over time
[2:16:29] <user_naim> Man this Asylum sucks.
[2:16:34] <cheap_turbo> that was just her boston accent
[2:16:35] <pi_in_the_sci> she's just from brooklyn
[2:16:35] <Shardlab> The accent was a put-on in the beginning. Then they just made that her actual accent
[2:16:35] <+skyheys> yeah, tara did a mediocre job
[2:16:35] <exnuart> she's from queens
[2:16:37] <dekkitout> "It was a very small subpoena"
[2:16:40] <+Javatron69> i like how in the later games they made it apparent that everyone has a hard jersey accent
[2:16:42] <jorniev> thats just the accent woolie
[2:16:44] <%eyezehuhh> probably different voice direction
[2:16:44] <dinnydanny777> Listen, not everyone wants to work at the asylum for the criminally insane, they can't be too choosy LUL
[2:16:44] <+Story_Ark> note: for the ground takedown, you dont have to press both at the same time. you just have to crouch and press y while crouched.
[2:16:48] <+evbites> @Stupid121v2 it removes the cape glide entirely
[2:16:48] <%Asuterisuku> Round Two!
[2:16:49] <%Halospaz117> Yeah, the lines are directly from the show, but her voice was more normal in the show
[2:16:51] <%Deepfriedhamster> Did you know Batman means Japanese sword
[2:16:51] <prime_name> @user_naim Most mental health facilities in media do
[2:17:04] <zedravan> most of them do
[2:17:08] <+Diamond_Dynamo> I remember I read a comic called Harleen a while ago, that just deals with her becoming the villain we know today
[2:17:10] <slandracon> Every villain has great interviews
[2:17:11] <Komayeda> INVERTED TAKEDOWN
[2:17:12] <+trav2_> the goons are so jacked in this lmao
[2:17:16] <+Gohyakuen> inverted tekedown
[2:17:16] <therealtacopancakes> inverted takedown
[2:17:17] <+TechnoSyndrome> INVERTED TAKEDOWN
[2:17:17] <+discognition> inverted takedown!
[2:17:17] <+GenesisKnight> Get inverted takedown
[2:17:18] <+even_the_yuenglings> get inverted takedown
[2:17:22] <devanmuse> Inverted Takedown is the most useful skill for the stealth sections
[2:17:22] <mudamudajo> Special takedown
[2:17:22] <marvel877> inverted takedown
[2:17:22] <peachy996> You can meet that same female doctor in the Zsasz room, but you missed her. No biggie
[2:17:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> Inverted Takedown!!!!
[2:17:25] <+ShutUpAceyP> please get the inverted takedown
[2:17:26] <Indigo_Automaton> Invereted Takedown will help!
[2:17:27] <binaryanomaly16> INVERTED TAKEDOWN, WOOLZ
[2:17:29] <Frodiddly> @skyheys IIRC, this was the one game that had the TAS VA
[2:17:29] <NoireRequiem> Idk there are some takes that she kissed her way through her degree
[2:17:29] <brunoberserk> inverter takedown is awesome
[2:17:30] <amiavamp> When you glide kick they can feel the menacing aura radiating from you
[2:17:33] <LVL1_Scumbag> Crits are good
[2:17:34] <$QueequegTheater> Inverted Takedown
[2:17:34] <+Superbro64> shhhh. chat
[2:17:35] <ralphfromdk> Fighting is not for rooms with guns. Guns mean stealth
[2:17:38] <jamsbybetty> maybe that recording is her getting hired to be a nurse to be an insider for Joker
[2:17:40] <+ScottishMadJacko> Stop bacmseating
[2:17:41] <%Deekman> Every time he fails to kill the Joker the blood of his next thousand victims is on his hands
[2:17:43] <OblivionSword1> Chat relax
[2:17:43] <PWNMAKER> Inverted takedown time Woolz
[2:17:50] <+JacknZack27> I love the inverted takedown
[2:17:53] <DSD24> Wow Bats looked intense there
[2:17:55] <Doctadaking> Inverted Takedown is so good that it became part of the default move list in the sequels
[2:17:56] <+chiazam> Inverted Takedown
[2:17:57] <puluxor> That art is savage asakuraYer
[2:17:58] <feralspidey> Damnit, I missed the first two hours! Woolie, you're gonna get into the combat in this game. It is literally "Do Combo" the Batman Game.
[2:17:59] <alphalejandro> Baman was like ARRRRGH
[2:18:00] <brian_peppers1> so dont mash
[2:18:04] <%runegod20> the critical combo thing is the exact same blue hit thing you had in spiderman ps4
[2:18:06] <%dreadedcthulhu> he'll get it when he decides to get it
[2:18:07] <%krispen_wa> Telltale Harley is best Harley C/D?
[2:18:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:18:09] <Zebroneath> press on hit confirm
[2:18:11] <%HollowedIdjit> No Mashing
[2:18:15] <user_naim> That one’s good too
[2:18:20] <+chosenjuan42> Do combo instead of more moveset?
[2:18:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> "I don't need you to be scared. I need you to be quiet."
[2:18:31] <%Mrthefro> Incentive to not mash SeemsGood
[2:18:32] <%LCLSmoothie> "im not scared of you batman"  - man scared of batman
[2:18:34] <rytisone> glide kick is loud
[2:18:37] <%Asuterisuku> Don't Mash, the Mechanic.
[2:18:49] <+Dova573> man I love making this people scared
[2:18:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HES LEARNING
[2:18:54] <dukenux> The part where they start freaking out is the best
[2:18:55] <jorniev> man i kinda wanna play asylum again
[2:18:55] <whiteblacklight74> not lethal btw
[2:18:55] <slandracon> Stealth is 60% easier with invert takedown
[2:18:58] <Yung_FckUp> this game really makes you FEEL LIKE BATMAN
[2:19:05] <Jaysky> TERRIFIED
[2:19:06] <@Solidus_113> terrified
[2:19:10] <%Josef_Stryker> TERRIFIED
[2:19:19] <amiavamp> drop down and punch him
[2:19:22] <+Diamond_Dynamo> iirc, going totally quiet will get you more xp than going loud. They might not have added that until later though
[2:19:25] <+MisterCrimson> 30 bpm...isn't that near death?
[2:19:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:19:45] <@akuda_bar> batman totally doesnt kill people
[2:19:46] <zedravan> goomba'd
[2:19:46] <+ImSoWizard> Batman fuckin Goomba stomped that guy
[2:19:47] <feralspidey> Batman NEVER Kills. Just like Kiryu.
[2:19:47] <+Story_Ark> i know people meme it but it really does make you feel like batman. seeing the bad guys get scared is the best
[2:19:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> As long as it works
[2:19:51] <Gorotheninja> Condition: Pants Full of Shit
[2:19:53] <+Superbro64> fat batass
[2:19:55] <+Javaa01> You don't have the stealth takedown from gargoyle upgrade
[2:19:57] <user_naim> Condition: Fucked
[2:20:00] <%megaman_sentinel> never kills
[2:20:06] <dinnydanny777> Imagine a criminal just like has a heart attack because of Batman LUL
[2:20:07] <peachy996> There can be multiple ways to take out a man, Glide Kick is your Vanilla route
[2:20:08] <+EySoyCoco> OH SHIT A SOCIETY GAME
[2:20:11] <+gustavozxd> still a pretty good movie tho at least
[2:20:14] <+TheotherKristian> 150bpm is a lot of beats
[2:20:18] <%Asuterisuku> Batman is a terrorist who targets specifically criminals.
[2:20:24] <%jepupu> Have you had a BPM sensor on?
[2:20:26] <+Javatron69> wasnt the whole thing in the nolan movies is that batman kinda sucked at fighting?
[2:20:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> I have. It's called the last 10 Stages of Bloody Palace.
[2:20:31] <+whackashack> whackashack subscribed with Prime. 
[2:20:36] <+Undenizen> Reggie, have you ever been in REAL SHIT?
[2:20:36] <slandracon> Fun Fact: Condition effects AI
[2:20:36] <%Mrthefro> Please save Reggie from the sun
[2:20:37] <andre11dr> Some horror games will do that
[2:20:37] <+AnIrishPapaya> eh 150 is nothin
[2:20:37] <%Noonoox12> REALLY hard parts of video games have gotten my heart GOING
[2:20:38] <%jiggy_snipe> the machete man for instance Kappa
[2:20:39] <prime_name> Why is God trying to blind Reggie?
[2:20:40] <$QueequegTheater> Individual spikes can totally happen with big jump scares
[2:20:47] <+condemned_15> That shakey cam only worked when he was fighting Falcone's men at the docks. Every scene after that was annoying
[2:20:47] <+nabs2099> @javatron69 Nolan in general didn't really understand Batman all too well.
[2:20:47] <TallPixels> you ever get lost?
[2:20:49] <CoffeeSlice> ReggieVS RE7
[2:20:53] <StarPupil1> Other way
[2:20:55] <mudamudajo> Imagine a goon actually had an animation were they shit there ass from terror.
[2:20:57] <ralphfromdk> If Batman was out to beat your ass, you too would be scared LUL
[2:20:58] <Wild_Samurai> someone obviously never played the new Ghosts n Goblins
[2:20:58] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @evbites

[2:22:36] <NoireRequiem> boo
[2:22:37] <alfredfromthedusk> What if Batman just ignored the Riddler? Would he just explode?
[2:22:39] <amiavamp> The riddler is the rich kid who failed his way to success

[2:30:50] <mudamudajo> Welcome to Arkham Asylum Woolie.
[2:30:50] <Zebroneath> some are VERY bullshit, so no worries

[2:30:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I enjoyed them all of you speak for yourself, I got my trophy
[2:31:04] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus they're totally optional
[2:31:05] <+Javaa01> @HitchhikingThrough Some (like that one) lead to character bios, but yeah most are just for brownie points, XP and cheevos

[2:31:27] <raikagelord1> The Creeper is good Joker. And All the Riddles where great.
[2:31:29] <Gorotheninja> I'd do the riddles, Woolie, because the usually give character bios. You can skip the trophies tho.

[2:32:53] <RyuuAoi> You can basically fly in Arkham city
[2:32:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> tip: one of the riddler answers is to look at Wayne Tower
[2:33:00] <%mikesapartment> oh shit woolie is playing his favorite game
[2:33:01] <+Diamond_Dynamo> City will always be my jam (and I even like Knight and to a lesser extent Origins, despite their problems), but this game is really great
[2:33:02] <+BusterRepukken> lol
[2:33:05] <SenpaiMD> is this the remastered or original?
[2:33:16] <snakest3alth> Original
[2:33:17] <%X2Eliah> @mikesapartment eeeh he's not 100% feeling it
[2:33:18] <@Solidus_113> protecc car
[2:33:21] <raikagelord1> gorotheninja I agree the thing I appreciate the most besides Gameplay was the Lore/Character Bio’s.

[2:33:48] <+Story_Ark> lol wut? woolie is totally enjoing the game besides the riddler stuff wtf you talking about
[2:33:51] <Sternieliscious> Arkham Island is just an island that hasn't heard of Jimmy Buffet.
[2:33:53] <dukenux> Shutter Island more like
[2:33:58] <amiavamp> The map feels like it's from a survival horror game more than metroid
[2:34:01] <mattymcfilth> north memphis south memphis westwood orange mound?
[2:34:05] <+even_the_yuenglings> hmm who could possibly be in the gardens?
[2:34:10] <alvaroeltz> that is your job dumbass
[2:34:12] <spamspaz> "Thanks Batman"
[2:34:15] <+evbites> @runegod20 it really empowers the patients
[2:34:18] <%marrs_bars> Did I hear Riker's Island?

[2:34:35] <+TheotherKristian> PhEeL lIkE bAtMaN
[2:34:36] <%Asuterisuku> Not just 2k9, Unreal Engine 3 2k9.
[2:34:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Fun Fact:  Gotham City is based on Jersey City and Newark and is canonically in New Jersey
[2:34:37] <%Exiliator> Bat-butt
[2:34:39] <Dante_Namikaze1> it would be an analog except there is also black gate prison where the regular criminals go and rikers actually exists in the DC Universe
[2:34:40] <RyuuAoi> Wow fuck Ben Affleck
[2:34:44] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> Graphics are more than servicable.
[2:34:47] <%spuddnyk> Unreal 3 at it's peak
[2:34:50] <Yung_FckUp> batman got cake
[2:34:50] <3Xgilly> luckily you will be inside a large chunk of this game
[2:34:53] <andre11dr> Man 2000s games were fucking GREY
[2:34:55] <+Superbro64> chair guy can only do so much 😔
[2:34:56] <feralspidey> This is where the real Metroidvania exploring begins.
[2:34:58] <mr_sups> More Tom Kane
[2:35:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Batman ass under the cape
[2:35:03] <peachy996> Oh that is SO blatant I never noticed that
[2:35:03] <blaggablag> It looks okay honestly.

[2:35:10] <+wanzerfaust> That's a stiff-ass hood!
[2:35:11] <frostyjay3> @spuddnyk Shit this game was Unreal 3!?!?!?!?
[2:35:13] <$QueequegTheater> Spongebob is that you
[2:35:14] <T_Sasquatch> I still prefer asylum to all the shitty cities in the next games. Its very gothic
[2:35:16] <mudamudajo> In the remaster its raining outside and they do the Arkham knight wet effect on Batman.
[2:35:18] <%X2Eliah> @peachy996 right? Such a good hint
[2:35:19] <$emptyantics> A botanical garden I wonder who they have in there Kappa
[2:35:21] <lets_be_friendos> what year was this? 2009?

[2:35:27] <johnnydalmann> hey I'm talhkin here
[2:35:27] <%runegod20> real dumb move on his part
[2:35:31] <AstralBlad3> Dont forget the remaster fumbles the graphics
[2:35:33] <+FuqBoiSlim> Why does his mask have wrinkles on it bro how mad is this man
[2:35:39] <amiavamp> Gothic art deco will never not be a good style
[2:35:39] <bamboostick4> !uptime

[2:36:27] <SolidusA> Weeb
[2:36:28] <%ZweihanderSteve> how skin tight is batman's mask?? or did he specifically sculpt it those forehead wrinkles. LUL LUL
[2:36:29] <Darren716> What a dork with a big penis, I mean what
[2:36:29] <+Story_Ark> batman: nah bruce is cool
[2:36:32] <clack14> fuck that bruce guy right batman?
[2:36:32] <+memes_are_cancer> "Haha...yeah..."
[2:36:37] <pepinillomaton> My problem with this game is how much of the screen is covered by freaking Batman
[2:36:40] <Rain_Mage> This is totally a Zeta Moment
[2:36:44] <RyuuAoi> 2020>2009
[2:36:53] <+gustavozxd> and also Joker in that game is GREAT
[2:36:53] <$QueequegTheater> Does Croc's cave have BET tho
[2:37:00] <DelgotHansto> *Grapple Away*
[2:37:02] <lets_be_friendos> @MrBreckenridge oh yeah it's JUST like the so called insurrection ConcernDoge

[2:37:03] <+Walopoh> Fuck Batman games, I want more Bruce Wayne games LUL
[2:37:08] <%runegod20> in his defense, it looks like some of that money gets stolen by how bad a state this place is in despite how much he puts into here

[2:37:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Coward LUL
[2:37:12] <ralphfromdk> Oh no... Wollie and maps....
[2:37:17] <MrGuy516> I remember playing this for the first time and thinking that games will never look better than this. LUL
[2:37:21] <+Javaa01> It is where batman's face is looking
[2:37:22] <%eyezehuhh> #JUICE4EVA
[2:37:31] <peachy996> Let Woolie figure it out it's fine
[2:37:35] <amiavamp> @MrGuy516 TBF this is one of the better looking games of this generation
[2:37:38] <+FuzzyGuru> I mean, this game still aged remarkably well considering it's 12 years old. I know some people that have aged worse than this game in 12 years.
[2:37:44] <$emptyantics> Woolie becomes DSP with maps
[2:37:46] <+Javatron69> this looks like the area leading up to bloodstarves beast
[2:37:48] <+ScottishMadJacko> ....
[2:37:49] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Man, I still wish we could get a game on the level of this series with full-on flying

[2:38:07] <bamboostick4> Is this what Pattinson Batman will act like?
[2:38:08] <mighty_fine_trousers> solomon grundy huh. he playing the trilogy?
[2:38:09] <brian_peppers1> This looked amazing.......in 2009
[2:38:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I believe Solomon Grundy IS a riddle answer in that graveyard somewhere

[2:38:31] <fuji_92> ITS OLD WOOLIE LUL
[2:38:32] <youngking_kush> This game is cute in comparison to City and Knight
[2:38:32] <user_naim> Don’t worry about it
[2:38:36] <+JacknZack27> Its fiiiiiine
[2:38:38] <TallPixels> this is an aesthetic
[2:38:40] <@Solidus_113> the classic shot reverse-shot
[2:38:42] <+LynbellDaYo> don't look too close or the simulation will crack
[2:38:45] <Mcmuffin______> did outside look better in remaster
[2:38:45] <andre11dr> Was Dead Space 1 2009?
[2:38:51] <fritz_dacat> Back in the 09. I was an acceptable video game
[2:38:52] <%Lion_kun> There are PS2 games that look better than this.
[2:38:52] <%X2Eliah> So not gonna lie, I didn't recall this game looking THIS bad.
[2:38:58] <LunarRemix> God those stone cold faces
[2:39:00] <prime_name> This poor door
[2:39:00] <%Exiliator> Open close open close LUL
[2:39:03] <+Javaa01> They didn't change the camera angles in the remaster btw, that looks dated no matter what
[2:39:03] <%Josef_Stryker> Remember this is from 2009
[2:39:05] <wibbwobbler> dat leaf budget tho
[2:39:08] <+wanzerfaust> There's two, maybe three more Steve Blums in there!
[2:39:09] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh god that door
[2:39:10] <super_harley_dude> jpeg land lol
[2:39:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> Not Jackson!
[2:39:15] <defaultname3887> WAIT IT FINALLY HAPPENED!??!??!?!
[2:39:18] <PanicSwytch> Sure batman
[2:39:23] <BlackermanZX> where the fuck is the justice league though
[2:39:24] <derap41> Batman is so fucking hard right now
[2:39:25] <+Radkon> 2 hours into the game "I'm ending this"
[2:39:28] <%runegod20> and remember, according to what that guy said, this isn't the first breakout
[2:39:28] <blaggablag> *inmeadiately kills jackson*
[2:39:31] <$QueequegTheater> @BlackermanZX busy
[2:39:32] <FrostedZaibatsu> No... Jackson was 2 weeks from retirement
[2:39:33] <+primax104> batman had to walk so that spidey could swing
[2:39:34] <alphalejandro> They just copy paste the same guy all over this place?
[2:39:35] <$Kaiser_Loar> was that Nolen North
[2:39:37] <jaygee303> One thing I’ll say is that you really see the improvement in graphics of the Two generations in the 3 games
[2:39:37] <anAngryHamster> Not 2nd Lt. Chavez!
[2:39:42] <+Javatron69> yes
[2:39:43] <$emptyantics> Wait till they see the glowup in Arkham Knight
[2:39:44] <feralspidey> It is an older title.
[2:39:45] <seniormeatbox> hold trigger
[2:39:47] <Darren716> Hold rt as you fall
[2:39:50] <xain234> CROUCH

[2:40:04] <alfredfromthedusk> Arkham Asylum: It's been [0] Days since the last comlpete prison break!
[2:40:06] <+gustavozxd> @emptyantics the game everyone hates atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:40:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they don't hear you dropping, because BATMAN
[2:40:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> silent bat feet
[2:40:11] <%Pillagius> Pillagius subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! WOOOOO!
[2:40:15] <Doctadaking> Half this asylum is run by Steve Blum
[2:40:17] <rytisone> shhhhhhhh
[2:40:19] <mexicansunglasses> Graphics ain't everything. In fact they're nothing. Knight is the prettiest but it's also the worst written Batmobile game ever made.
[2:40:24] <peachy996> Only Dreams now
[2:40:25] <SenpaiMD> This game is more than 12 years old :(
[2:40:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Heat move

[2:45:59] <+PikeBot> The Tweedle-Dum one is harrrrd
[2:46:00] <Komayeda> Some are hidden behind things you can't get to at this moment
[2:46:01] <brunoberserk> do it if you want
[2:46:01] <+Undenizen> the riddler trophies are VERY not worth it.
[2:46:02] <Darren716> Woolie you'll be revisiting these areas a lot, you'll have the time
[2:46:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The Riddler stuff in this game is manageable compared to the later games, DO THEM
[2:46:03] <user_naim> Do it later
[2:46:05] <%doomerskeletor13> The jingle is so good
[2:46:06] <fuji_92> 100% optional just so u know
[2:46:08] <+Damie904> I dont think anyone will care if you just use a guide for some of these.
[2:46:11] <%Asuterisuku> The brain goblins have been planted.
[2:46:11] <Indigo_Automaton> Sandbag the Riddler. He HATES it
[2:46:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I believe it was on the ground behind where they are
[2:46:12] <alvaroeltz> Try it, but dont spend so much on it
[2:46:13] <TheWizardOfWordplay> give it the clown college try
[2:46:14] <+nabs2099> Woolie u can safely ignore the riddler stuff cos it doesn't get good until Arkham city
[2:46:14] <majindusto> This LP is totally gonna be Woolie  interrupting Dialog constantly...Isn't  it?
[2:46:15] <EcchiMichael> Don't worry about it
[2:46:15] <ralphfromdk> Don't feel to bad about the big open areas, you will come back to them again and again.
[2:46:17] <+thewellroundedgamer99> I don’t have to
[2:46:18] <samuelfisk> Some of the riddles are cool. Others are not.
[2:46:18] <+CptBritches> You can't do em all or this playthrough will never end lol
[2:46:19] <snakest3alth> You can solve them postgame
[2:46:21] <brachydios777> It’s not worth it
[2:46:21] <+JacknZack27> Its up to you. I find them fun, but if you dont its okay
[2:46:22] <%runegod20> can't blame anyone using a guide if they get too stuck on them
[2:46:22] <+Zeroblazex> It’s a Metroidvania, sometimes you’ll have to come back

[2:46:26] <LunarRemix> You can just do it off-stream looking up a guide
[2:46:26] <+condemned_15> you're not gonna find shit at that vantage point
[2:46:30] <$QueequegTheater> You should do them all even if you have to do them off stream
[2:46:32] <+CloudsBringRain> AHHHHH. IT WAS RIGHT THERE
[2:46:35] <+TheotherKristian> Is Arkham a Metroid-Prime Like?
[2:46:38] <+mister___doctor> How many times has the Death Note joke been made

[2:46:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Don't sweat the shiny in the tower

[2:47:22] <+k0alapants> How many times did they not see the giant seesaw
[2:47:27] <BlackermanZX> I bet Joker is a fan of redo of healer of some shit

[2:49:57] <%bread_assassin> So who would be the best Batman villain to be a henchmen for.
[2:49:59] <Doctadaking> The enemy rag dolls are hilarious
[2:50:00] <%Halospaz117> Its goof but good goof
[2:50:05] <%Exiliator> Pow! Zap! Bam!
[2:50:08] <fuji_92> it's the type of good goofy tho
[2:50:10] <zachattak01> is good jank
[2:50:10] <ralphfromdk> Eh... it's kinda to show how much of a beast that Batman is. He jumps around like... a superhero
[2:50:11] <%doomerskeletor13> @bread_assassin Kite Man
[2:50:12] <+evbites> @bread_assassin penguin
[2:50:13] <%HitchhikingThrough> Not a lot of difference between joker and a fromsoftware npc
[2:50:14] <+NocturnePsycho> they double down on the absurdity in future combat
[2:50:15] <+samuraiknack> Mr Freeze
[2:50:15] <$emptyantics> We can all agree that Dr. Friez is the best boss fight out all games right?
[2:50:17] <RyuuAoi> Batman ain't gonna kill you but he gonna bust some skulls
[2:50:27] <%krispen_wa> so what does PhysX actually do if it doesnt control ragdolls?
[2:50:37] <samuelfisk> Emptyantics absolutely
[2:50:42] <thetrashman_sc> monkaS

[2:50:46] <reonome> ME?
[2:50:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> me?
[2:50:46] <TheCrispyBoi> me?
[2:50:46] <RoboticRexkek> cloths I think
[2:50:48] <+MisterCrimson> @bread_assassin there was a comic about just that and the consensus was Riddler since he offers insurance and doesn't wantonly kill his henchmen.
[2:50:49] <@Solidus_113> smoke effects, papers, etc
[2:50:51] <brachydios777> Me?
[2:50:53] <dukenux> :) ?
[2:50:54] <UvBenServed> Sup
[2:50:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus whiffing and attacking the air or missing a counter makes you drop the combo too
[2:50:54] <+PikeBot> @krispen_wa it adds more moving stuff in the environment like fallen papers, leaves etc
[2:50:54] <+Javaa01> @krispen_wa Cloth physics, smoke particles, broken glass, tertiary things like that
[2:50:55] <%Asuterisuku> @krispen_wa Lots of the little extra bits; fog, foliage, loose documents.
[2:50:56] <%patriotrenegade> ME?
[2:50:58] <anothernub> DAMN
[2:50:58] <%runegod20> @bread_assassin There was a conversation in the comics about that, I think the goons came to the conclusion that the Penguin is the best since he won't randomly kill you like the joker, or as a 50/50 with 2 face
[2:50:58] <seniormeatbox> DAMN
[2:50:59] <+Stupid121v2> AYOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[2:54:58] <$QueequegTheater> Joker needs that batdick

[2:56:33] <dukenux> "Annihilation" is a good sci-fi movie that no one watched. @WoolieVersus can you say which tv show, without spoiling too much?
[2:56:34] <therealtacopancakes> give us the tv series woolz, wanna get in on that
[2:56:36] <+Stupid121v2> Mark KILLS it this game, and he KEEPS getting new lines as the game goes on. fuckin perfect

[2:56:39] <andre11dr> Mark loves this shit
[2:56:39] <+Walopoh> SO. MANY. LINES.
[2:56:40] <+CptBritches> The bear screaming in Annihilation is one of the most disturbing things I've seen in a film
[2:56:41] <mr_red117> Mark gives it his all
[2:56:42] <rytisone> It really paid off to hire Mark
[2:56:49] <%Halospaz117> Batman's got t-rex arms

[2:56:50] <RaidenRising> he loves it
[2:56:51] <+Javaa01> If you like Mark, then this is the trilogy for you, cause boy is there a lot of Mark here, and he's just going all out
[2:56:53] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Mark putting the HAM in Hamill

[2:57:12] <+nabs2099> What so MCU STAY WINNING? AGAIN?
[2:57:15] <BaslerJones> this game is so odd
[2:57:22] <majindusto> MARVEL  BIAS
[2:57:23] <@Solidus_113> no talking about MCU
[2:57:24] <dinnydanny777> Imagine literally dying to a super dangerous criminal at work for $15 an hour, damn
[2:57:36] <+MisterCrimson> wasn't annihilation that movie that was just Strange Journey?
[2:57:37] <peachy996> This game wants you to look around the area
[2:57:43] <+Undenizen> I mean, have you ever seen STALKER? Not the game, the movie. Old ass russian film. arthouse as fuck. Annihilation was going for that.
[2:57:44] <LunarRemix> When does this take place?
[2:57:46] <RyuuAoi> The MCU is dead
[2:57:46] <+samuraiknack> Finally a repeated Joker line
[2:57:47] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Do you think Arkham guards get 39.5 hours a week, too?
[2:57:48] <derap41> Should stil be 22
[2:57:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> what is Canadian Minimum Wage?
[2:57:54] <Wild_Samurai> Imagine living in a world where Lazarus Pits exist and dying at all
[2:57:55] <ralphfromdk> But... didn't he say 50? LUL
[2:58:00] <Tooniearcade> Loll
[2:58:04] <DatAsuna> In 2007 that was fairly good
[2:58:04] <+mechslayer71> @ralphfromdk nope
[2:58:07] <penitentpendant> Bonus points if it's only 39 hours a week
[2:58:10] <$QueequegTheater> @ralphfromdk no
[2:58:10] <wruce__billis> @lunarremix eighties
[2:58:10] <fuji_92> he said 15 100%
[2:58:18] <Blank9> They get the same health care the Arkham inmates get.
[2:58:20] <+Walopoh> I also want to shout out Kevin Conroy as the PERFECT Batman voice. I can't imagine any other
[2:58:20] <exnuart> $15 is minimum security lol
[2:58:21] <+ClericOfSparda> Why do you think that guy betrayed the Asylum for Joker? he probably paid better
[2:58:21] <Decimated_body> AMOGUS
[2:58:21] <Dao_Puppy> What's the Min in Canada right now?
[2:58:23] <+Stupid121v2> He said $15 fo sho
[2:58:23] <mudamudajo> Every guard corpse (15 dollars)
[2:58:23] <%Asuterisuku> That wage point is bullshit blazing.
[2:58:30] <$ParatrooperDylan> Fun fact
[2:58:30] <%patriotrenegade> What benfits do Arkham guards get? Are they part of a union?
[2:58:30] <dukenux> @MisterCrimson it was more like "Color out of Space"
[2:58:35] <Joestar1890> According to inflation it would be $25 now....but you know damn well Sharp would keep the pay at 15.
[2:58:35] <+Superbro64> good comedy truly transcends time itself, huh
[2:58:35] <CastellanVon> He rips that grate off so swole like
[2:58:40] <+evbites> @ClericOfSparda 1000 dollers a day
[2:58:45] <andre11dr> Well, how much do the Riker's guards get?
[2:58:50] <user_naim> Can you slide through wents in this game like you can in City chat?
[2:58:51] <FrostedZaibatsu> $15 is still not enough for today in reality
[2:58:53] <Forkeye> all that money and no generosity
[2:59:08] <Darren716> I mean it's $15 for an hour for a job that likely doesn't require any advance education. Like they let that drunk be a guard so they'll anyone
[2:59:09] <dinnydanny777> I've seen the one where the people clean old buildings that they can't put scaffolding on and fuck that
[2:59:14] <Visorak6> ITS JUST NOT IN THE BUDGET
[2:59:15] <+Javatron69> @user_naim that's only in city and beyond I believe
[2:59:18] <brachydios777> Thanks billionaire Bruce Wayne
[2:59:19] <%runegod20> truckers who drive through ice and stuff and people on fishing boats make way more money than that
[2:59:20] <+AnIrishPapaya> Hmmm Arkham Super Villain Island Security Guard or Customer Service Associate at Home Depot. hmmmmm
[2:59:20] <alvaroeltz> And they have A LOT of guards, dont know how
[2:59:20] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:59:20] <Uncle_Christian> Arkham has a Temp agency
[2:59:24] <LunarRemix> Oh then it's actually alot. That's legit good pay in the '80s
[2:59:27] <ExpressNode> Running a gambit
[2:59:30] <Depthcharge2030> people have literally lost their hands to Killer Croc working at arkham
[2:59:31] <Ashenik1> WEEKENDS?!?
[2:59:31] <%Halospaz117> WHAT IS THIS HANDOUT BULLSHIT
[2:59:39] <anothernub> Bruce Wayne could single handedly solve the crime problem in Gotham by just giving everyone on the city an universal basic income of 15$/h out of his own pocket.
[2:59:40] <RyuuAoi> Prices going up. The dollars down.
[2:59:44] <deviljhojho_> stealthy bat
[2:59:45] <DatAsuna> @FrostedZaibatsu I mean they were saying $15 was needed 5 years ago, and inflation doesn't wait for you to catch up, yeah.
[2:59:46] <psidefx> HOLIDAYS OFF?!?
[2:59:54] <@akuda_bar> why are there gargoyles in a warehouse
[2:59:55] <+Robob00p> You would use those ten days for when joker is in

[3:01:57] <LVL1_Scumbag> Guns are legit
[3:01:57] <marvel877> Inverted takedown
[3:01:57] <samuelfisk> Love the game over screens
[3:01:59] <Alejandroxciv> bullet damage high
[3:01:59] <masterfire23> inverted takedown is good
[3:02:00] <+Damie904> Get Inverted Takedown
[3:02:00] <StarlitStunner> That man had the accuracy of Deadshot
[3:02:00] <amiavamp> Batman would be a weak Persona 5 boss
[3:02:01] <dukenux> BAT vs GUN
[3:02:02] <FrostedZaibatsu> His suit is suppose to be bulletproof btw LUL
[3:02:03] <brian_peppers1> BULLETS HURT

[3:02:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thats super useful
[3:02:22] <jowi_time> yes the best one
[3:02:26] <DrkJP520> I don't think the noise was the issue. You kicked that guy right infront of his mate
[3:02:27] <+SWindleFeD> You can do loud takedowns, but you have to really know where each enemy is and where they're looking
[3:02:28] <%thechungiestofbois> Best one
[3:02:33] <+chiazam> Inverted Takedown
[3:02:34] <Ashenik1> @FrostedZaibatsu  I mean id did protect him for like 50 shots
[3:02:37] <%krispen_wa> Oh, this room
[3:02:41] <%runegod20> perch takedown sounding hella nice with how rough going loud against guns look like
[3:02:51] <wruce__billis> Do the gel this time, you don’t have to be near to detonate
[3:02:56] <$emptyantics> Someone make a MUGEN video called Batman vs GUN
[3:03:01] <@akuda_bar> do you think batman feels any guilt at all about the fact these guys got kidnapped because he wouldnt break jokers neck
[3:03:25] <SteamShow> Probably not.
[3:03:33] <+nabs2099> No. he gets off to the thrill
[3:03:36] <@akuda_bar> @SteamShow acceptable losses
[3:03:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> What do you mean "I can?" Reggie is playing LUL
[3:03:41] <Spiralpower1620> Batman got the same weakness as his parents
[3:03:42] <dukenux> cant you afford the upgrade now?
[3:03:43] <%Asuterisuku> Experience is tallied at the end of predator encounters, so you won't be able to get it until afterwards.
[3:03:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @emptyantics it exists, it's called Injustice 2 specifically
[3:03:45] <deviljhojho_> HE IS STARTING TO BELIEVE
[3:03:46] <%dreadedcthulhu> batarangs draw enemies to the spot they land
[3:03:47] <+evbites> @akuda_bar every day. it's the states fault
[3:03:48] <PWNMAKER> Nah batman loves an excuse to beat up criminals
[3:03:48] <dinnydanny777> I love that these superhero games are secretly stealth games LUL
[3:03:56] <alfredfromthedusk> Do you think $15 was what the Rocksteady employee who wrote that line made
[3:04:09] <Doctadaking> Once combat is over, upgrade points go through
[3:04:10] <johnnydalmann> you won't get xp until after an encounter
[3:04:14] <+chiazam> You can Quite Drop By TAPPING A
[3:04:26] <brunoberserk> he is learning
[3:04:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Thousands of innocent bodies will stand as a monument to Batman's cowardi- I mean mercy
[3:04:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BATMAN NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[3:04:34] <%krispen_wa> you think batman is human enough to feel guilt? a person who watches the joker murder literal thousands of people and NOT do anything isnt a human. he's a fucking monster
[3:04:34] <+SWindleFeD> Wait is this Woolies first time playing this?
[3:04:38] <$QueequegTheater> SMOOTH
[3:04:42] <penitentpendant> Skeleton WARRIOR

[3:05:15] <CastellanVon> Explosive gel is so fun to play around with
[3:05:19] <amiavamp> Gotham has a crazy high percentage of unreformable supervillains
[3:05:22] <Doctadaking> You don’t have to hang. You can do it just sitting on the gargoyle normally
[3:05:25] <%Asuterisuku> You don't need to invert before hand to do the takedown, but it looks cool.
[3:05:25] <Spiralpower1620> @dinnydanny777 can you imagine a stealth Superman game? jonahs1Haha
[3:05:30] <jotabranded> chat, this is blind for both of them?
[3:05:32] <brunoberserk> 2009 , man ...
[3:05:32] <T_Sasquatch> did you noice you did that entire encounter with detective vision ON
[3:05:36] <+Diamond_Dynamo> No need to hang first
[3:05:37] <+Walopoh> The reason Joker has no gun is because guns are NO JOKE in these games LUL
[3:05:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> about time the Slow mode was shortened
[3:05:40] <%HitchhikingThrough> @krispen_wa I think the more appropriate take is he feels guilty about his parents deaths all the time, so he doesn't really register additional guilt. Still monstrous, but for trauma reasons
[3:05:40] <%thechungiestofbois> @jotabranded yes
[3:05:42] <AstralBlad3> Why does batman gotta do it? Why doesn't a cop just kill joker after Batman is gone?

[3:15:52] <%Parapattern> THE LAMEST
[3:15:55] <+Diamond_Dynamo> "I would've solved all the puzzles I came up with" lol
[3:15:56] <wruce__billis> HUSH IS GARBAGE
[3:15:58] <%runegod20> wait, isn't this kind of weird based on later games?
[3:16:01] <%krispen_wa> So wait, Hush exists before Hush happened in Arkam Knight?
[3:16:02] <+condemned_15> ah yes. Hush from Hush LUL
[3:16:03] <+Zeroblazex> So he got this one but ignored the Arkham spirit
[3:16:04] <Darren716> Hush looks like some stupid 90s shit
[3:16:09] <brachydios777> Hush is not great
[3:16:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hush was 2006 or so?
[3:16:11] <%Mrthefro> Riddler is actually just chat.
[3:16:12] <TheWizardOfWordplay> retcon
[3:16:12] <CanadianAdam> Hush is some stupid 90s shit
[3:16:15] <+BritishTyrannosaur> This is just comic bios
[3:16:17] <$eco419> Looks like a jojo
[3:16:20] <anAngryHamster> Craaaaaaaaaawling iiiiiiiiiin my skiiiiiiin
[3:16:23] <%Lion_kun> oh hey, the worst Batman storyline ever
[3:16:24] <dinnydanny777> That seems like a stupid plan for a sociopath
[3:16:25] <$emptyantics> Did JOE MAD do the art for these?
[3:16:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he comes back in this series
[3:16:25] <+Diamond_Dynamo> This is some really bad art of Hush tbh
[3:16:27] <+Javaa01> Hush is really lame, but he still gets a really good mission in one of the later games
[3:16:28] <peachy996> He's not great but he has a great look. Probably a Homage to Darkman
[3:16:28] <deviljhojho_> surgical i get it
[3:16:28] <journeytogetgood> can't believe the hush animated movie made hush the riddler
[3:16:29] <andre11dr> Hush is really cool
[3:16:31] <centuronstar> @krispen_wa Nah. This was more just fanservice/trivia.
[3:16:31] <%runegod20> what are those pants
[3:16:31] <Joestar1890> Spoilers for Batman: Hush
[3:16:32] <halfmasks> LOOK AT THIS DORK
[3:16:33] <samuelfisk> Arkham Asylum is filled villains that get introduced in City and Knight as if they were new.
[3:16:34] <wruce__billis> IT GARBAGE
[3:16:36] <%Grimlockfly> Hush sucked
[3:16:37] <%Noonoox12> WAIT, So he knows who batman IS
[3:16:37] <%sirisvirus> this is why the riddles are cool
[3:16:39] <%krispen_wa> Hush is super overrated as a comic book arc
[3:16:39] <+PikeBot> Hush is so lame
[3:16:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> The comic came out in 2003
[3:16:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hush is the best, hes some rich white boy whos upset because he got the inheritance way later after plotting to get it way earlier
[3:16:42] <%Josef_Stryker> It's alright
[3:16:42] <zedravan> fairly new villain
[3:16:43] <DatAsuna> Hush is cool but his motive sucks
[3:16:44] <super_harley_dude> Hush as fucking garbage
[3:16:44] <Uncle_Christian> 2003
[3:16:44] <+Undenizen> that's lame!
[3:16:45] <+memes_are_cancer> BEEFY
[3:16:46] <eldragon_1> Hush had great art
[3:16:48] <Depthcharge2030> Hush had that Jim Lee art
[3:16:48] <%Asuterisuku> Hush DOES NOT know who Batman is.
[3:16:49] <wendigo172> Hush fucking sucks
[3:16:49] <StarlitStunner> Jason and Two-Face linked him good
[3:16:49] <brunoberserk> please dont watch the hush animated  adaptation , IS SO BAD
[3:16:51] <+Walopoh> People hate Hush
[3:16:53] <nvst4rk> Hish is cool
[3:16:55] <dinnydanny777> He's HUGE, he's larger than Batman
[3:16:55] <Dante_Namikaze1> This gets super retconned in the next game
[3:17:00] <meganicmp3> looks cool to me
[3:17:01] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Wait why did he blame Bruce for what Thomas did?
[3:17:01] <DracaenaLeaf> JoJo pose Kappa
[3:17:04] <puluxor> POUCHES
[3:17:05] <+taggerung403> Strength augmented by hate is something I need
[3:17:07] <UvBenServed> Needs more pouches
[3:17:08] <+Diamond_Dynamo> He sometimes looks better than that, pretty sure
[3:17:10] <phatmac16> Hush could be cool
[3:17:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HES 90S SHIT AND I LOVE IT
[3:17:16] <centuronstar> Got that Vergil Devil May Cry Manga look
[3:17:17] <alphalejandro> Basically Hush: "I want everything from you Bruce, even your face"
[3:17:18] <coreybom> Wow the chat is has some SHITTY opinions. Kappa
[3:17:19] <+sombraxyz> Hush did a hell of a good job from what I remember
[3:17:24] <Murdercles> is this just Darkman???
[3:17:26] <wruce__billis> The Owls also fucking suck
[3:17:26] <%krispen_wa> Hush is lamer Prometheus. And Prometheus is ALREADY lame
[3:17:27] <%Josef_Stryker> Court of Owls is sooooo good
[3:17:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Court of Owls is good shit
[3:17:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> So good!
[3:17:28] <$eco419> No u

[3:17:32] <$QueequegTheater> Court of Owls is great
[3:17:32] <+Walopoh> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli He was created in 2003 though
[3:17:32] <%Halospaz117> Wait is Hush just Face/Off?
[3:17:33] <meganicmp3> i read it its alright
[3:17:34] <anAngryHamster> Bruce's dad saves Tommy's dad= Tommy hates Batman
[3:17:36] <peachy996> The Owl aren't bad
[3:17:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the twist the next appearance of Hush in these games is slick
[3:17:40] <+CoronetChris> I read Hush... I don't get the hype.
[3:17:40] <wendigo172> @halospaz117 yes
[3:17:43] <+SWindleFeD> @Murdercles pretty much
[3:17:44] <psidefx> yes he is

[3:17:54] <agustorm123> Wow chat have good opinions
[3:17:58] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie is sick of the Riddler's bullshit already.
[3:18:02] <super_harley_dude> Court of owls is a better story
[3:18:02] <+Walopoh> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli ok I get that
[3:18:05] <$QueequegTheater> Bane is Venom
[3:18:07] <+PikeBot> Hush, both the arc and the character, sucks ass.
[3:18:08] <%runegod20> that name isn't a good sign
[3:18:12] <+Javaa01> Hmmmm I wonder if
[3:18:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:18:16] <coreybom> @anangryhamster Well tommy hated him because he WANTED him to die.
[3:18:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Cash Money, we like him
[3:18:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hush, the first arc by Jeph Loeb is great. Everything after was shit
[3:18:21] <peachy996> Visually: I think the Court of Owls and Hush are great
[3:18:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> "You named them 'X?' Are you for real?"
[3:18:32] <wruce__billis> shoot it with what
[3:18:36] <%Asuterisuku> That's a thing that happened in the Arkham Asylum comic in the leadup to this game.
[3:18:38] <+samuraiknack> Batman RIP is better than Court of Owls
[3:18:38] <Doctadaking> The guards in these games have a lot of personality. It’s great
[3:18:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I love Hush because his design is cool and his motivations are Dio Phantom Blood levels of petty, its fucking great
[3:18:39] <amiavamp> mind bullets
[3:18:42] <meganicmp3> use the gun
[3:18:48] <%krispen_wa> So who is the best "Batman but evil", because it certainly wasnt Hush
[3:18:51] <%dreadedcthulhu> punch the wall Kyle Wayne
[3:18:54] <+Undenizen> Yo if these doctors need to go back to school if they think psychosis is *transmittable*
[3:18:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> Batman RIP is part of a larger arc called The Grant Morrison run
[3:18:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Hush looks 90s because he was designed by Jim Ler
[3:18:59] <rytisone> MY MIIINDS
[3:19:04] <penitentpendant> Oh right, I forgot mashing the counter prompt drops combo in this game
[3:19:05] <dukenux> "MY MIIIIND"

[3:19:08] <Mattais88> Tekken slowdown

[3:19:13] <%LCLSmoothie> MY MIIIIND
[3:19:14] <thebalticguy1> Woolie you keep killing your combo by early parrying
[3:19:15] <journeytogetgood> grant morrison run is great
[3:19:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> Razor no BibleThump
[3:19:25] <alfredfromthedusk> @krispen_wa Azrael is a pretty good example, since he's not even totally evil
[3:19:25] <+Superbro64> "best in the entire state" sounds funny when you think about it, especially if gotham is in new Jersey LUL
[3:19:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> no if you mash combos in this game you drop it, it wants you to do a rhythm, like a rhythm game
[3:19:34] <Murdercles> I mean, I guess these takedowns were ok until you saw Yakuza LUL
[3:19:36] <+RyTYoung> We know Bats LUL

[3:19:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Batman says, as he continues to let Joker run wild every other week
[3:19:54] <amiavamp> "I won't let innocent people die" says man responsible for hundreds dead
[3:19:56] <brunoberserk> HE IS FINE

[3:32:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> AGRESSIVE SLAPPING
[3:32:28] <Hammatime8> I dunno why batman doesn't carry a tranq gun or something
[3:32:29] <%krispen_wa> Woolie really likes spamming counter
[3:32:30] <$eco419> Bonk
[3:32:31] <rytisone> that cape is magic
[3:32:33] <+CloudsBringRain> damn, the mash
[3:32:34] <%doomerskeletor13> @shonen_hero New York City exists too, the DC universe just has a bunch of extra cities
[3:32:34] <Murdercles> Gotham is analogous to Chicago, Metropolis to NYC
[3:32:37] <daddyscumeez> yooooo fuck yeah batman
[3:32:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie mashes counter LUL
[3:32:37] <LordOfThePoultry> don't mash counter woolie
[3:32:38] <deviljhojho_> that one was smooth
[3:32:38] <velgaduere> SHADOW COUNTER
[3:32:39] <meganicmp3> getting trigger happy with the counter
[3:32:40] <kamenspidey> bat hollowpoint
[3:32:43] <Doctadaking> They spent a lot of time on that cape
[3:32:43] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie, counter isn't royal guard
[3:32:45] <Indigo_Automaton> Mashing counter breaks your combo multiplier
[3:32:47] <brunoberserk> woolie , please dont mash the counter
[3:32:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> through most doors
[3:32:52] <puluxor> "I'm gonna be the one!"
[3:32:56] <+sevorai> mashin counter huh
[3:32:57] <%Asuterisuku> Checkpoints are generous in this game. It just saved.
[3:33:02] <+bigb00gi3> yeah, that little loopie in the bottom right is probably the autosave icon
[3:33:02] <FutaSnek> LUL Chat he's new to the game he'll get it
[3:33:02] <agustorm123> Batman is way overpowered to even fight superman only being a normal human
[3:33:03] <LVL1_Scumbag> Bat neurotoxin
[3:33:08] <Jashter18> Counter is basically a parry mashing fucks it up
[3:33:13] <Ashenik1> THE PIT
[3:33:16] <OblivionSword1> Chat Woolie will figure it out he just need practice

[3:33:37] <peachy996> Yeah let Woolie get accustomed to the game
[3:33:41] <FutaSnek> Bane is based as fuck
[3:33:42] <%krispen_wa> Bane is a good evil-Batman, the guy who had the opposite life of rich man Bruce Wayne
[3:33:46] <TraitGene2> good thing those guys are standing in front of two breakable walls
[3:33:47] <+Walopoh> That's why he has a Teddy Bear still, becuase he had to fight to keep it in his prison-childhood
[3:33:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bane in the Nolan movie just got relegated to Ra's side villain
[3:33:51] <alfredfromthedusk> Modern Bane is cool, I really dig it
[3:33:52] <%Asuterisuku> The Bane in this series is THAT Bane.
[3:33:56] <+ShinobiPhoenix> blow up the wall
[3:33:58] <Minerslovegames> @TraitGene2 the foil to batman
[3:34:00] <$emptyantics> Bane is my favorite Batman villiam
[3:34:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah Bane is Latin in the comics, not a white British dude like the movie
[3:34:01] <Treyu000> Knightfall Bane is great
[3:34:04] <agustorm123> is he playing with his frankestein setup?
[3:34:04] <Yung_FckUp> why are all the goons italian?
[3:34:07] <peachy996> I have full confidence he will ace Beatdown Hallway at the end of this game
[3:34:10] <%runegod20> ah, the blowing the hell out of people tutorial
[3:34:10] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie why
[3:34:10] <+misterwaifuu> He'd eat fish at high tide and his company was rats

[3:34:51] <s1rcuit> like most of Batman's villains are skilled individuals that unfortunately suffer from mental illness
[3:34:54] <mr_saturday93> does woolie just jump to conclusions ALL THE TIME?
[3:34:54] <mudamudajo> Kid Bane also befriended some inmates who nabbed books for him to read. He became hyper intelligent.
[3:35:01] <shincadad> Woolie.
[3:35:08] <%Asuterisuku> @mr_saturday93 Yes, and it's great.

[3:35:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DEATH BY DEBRIS
[3:35:23] <s1rcuit> Bane was also a skilled strategist
[3:35:23] <Wild_Samurai> How did this studio not make a game for a million years and get demoted to Suicide Squad now...?
[3:35:23] <+Javaa01> @mr_saturday93 Yeah, it's his superpower.

[3:38:34] <%Parapattern> WHy is that necessary
[3:38:35] <dukenux> They actually made it?
[3:38:39] <peachy996> They made a Clarice tvshow and I heard it's average

[3:38:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WHO?
[3:39:00] <devanmuse> Do you think that "Arkhamcare" website is/was a real site?
[3:39:01] <%doomerskeletor13> They also made a Clarice Sterling show that CAN’T mention Hannibal because of copyright stuff
[3:39:03] <+bigb00gi3> won't someone PLEASE think of the poor prison wardens

[3:39:12] <BourneWarrior> Ah yes the CNCU
[3:39:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Komayeda dont tempt them, or youll have The Shining x Anger Management
[3:39:22] <amiavamp> We were just talking about Snowpiercer 2 a few hours ago
[3:39:23] <+condemned_15> The Show sucks and Nurse Rached was just a shitty person. Not Hannibal Lecter
[3:39:26] <%Halospaz117> @Arancet ya spelt same with a C instead of an S :P
[3:39:31] <+trackles_64> authority?
[3:39:31] <s1rcuit> @Darren716 yeah, but making a series of shows make money, and execs can only think about money
[3:39:32] <Doctadaking> Time for that inverted takedown.
[3:39:32] <reonome> that voice sounds familiar
[3:39:35] <+ApocalypticExpress> these 2000s models I hate

[3:39:46] <%runegod20> that seems like a pretty crappy prosthetic hand, tachabana had a better one in the late 80s

[3:40:07] <xmetalicdemonx> @CanadianAdam yes
[3:40:11] <Darren716> They gotta be right under there to take themout
[3:40:15] <TraitGene2> everyone say hello to bunny rabbot from sonic the hedgehog
[3:40:16] <AthenaAegis> Ratchet is a show that exists. That's my review.

[3:40:25] <$eco419> True
[3:40:28] <+Robob00p> @agustorm123 We live in a society
[3:40:44] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Nurse Ratched is morally gray now

[3:41:20] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You can cut them down after they're strung up so you can drop them on inspecting enemies
[3:41:21] <+trackles_64> stealth is optional

[3:42:03] <DelgotHansto> Man stealth sections in Arkham Knight are so good

[3:42:12] <penitentpendant> The weird thing about EXP in this game is it also heals you. Part of the design point of the teeth is to allow you to heal between combat/stealth sections.
[3:42:12] <AncelDeLambert> this arena is great to go back to in future playthroughs, just to take advantage of the myriad takedown opportunities. Like the collapsible floor or breakthrough walls

[3:44:57] <Murdercles> while you are dicking around here, Alfred is infiltrating through the sewers with a knife in his teeth to do the job right
[3:44:58] <+CptBritches> Pronounced Kill-ian I think
[3:44:59] <s1rcuit> so my hypothesis for why Batman doesn't kill Joker despite knowing he'll kill more citizens is that he's actually afraid of killing people, in an episode of the 90's cartoon Scarecrow hits him with a gas that makes him fearless and he almost offs a dude
[3:44:59] <zedravan> F

[3:55:21] <dinnydanny777> Batman is not flat limesHeck
[3:55:22] <Johannen> I thought most of the art in here is original works, any notable artists in the credits?
[3:55:22] <dukenux> Hips and Nips
[3:55:24] <penitentpendant> And all the perfections breathed a sigh of relief, as there's no need to point out missables any more~
[3:55:25] <+CptBritches> Bat credit card!
[3:55:25] <+SWindleFeD> They couldn't fit the bat nips in the budget
[3:55:26] <deviljhojho_> it wasnt gordon, it was just a jobber!

[3:55:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> dont
[3:55:57] <deviljhojho_> Good man
[3:55:57] <Doctadaking> For LP purposes, it’s not worth it
[3:55:58] <dukenux> its fine
[3:55:59] <%runegod20> i get not doing them all, but woolie actually stared at it for a bit
[3:56:00] <%SophiaAmoreaVeritas> SeemsGood
[3:56:01] <velgaduere> everybody keep your OCD in check and we'll be good
[3:56:01] <Komayeda> perfectly alright
[3:56:03] <Ashenik1> its only 200 riddles Woolie ;d
[3:56:04] <user_naim> Yeah that’s fine
[3:56:05] <Indigo_Automaton> Sandbag the Riddler, it's what he deserves
[3:56:06] <coreybom> GOOD
[3:56:07] <+Walopoh> Don't do it for an LP
[3:56:07] <MAX116030> it aint fun
[3:56:09] <KidKaiser23> Fuck dem Riddles
[3:56:09] <brachydios777> That’s fine
[3:56:10] <majindusto> COWARD
[3:56:11] <%CptnCampy61> We understand
[3:56:11] <penitentpendant> @peachy996 He can't, permanently missable
[3:56:11] <RoboticRexkek> bat is no longer horny
[3:56:13] <+rafeeyell> just open a guide! the riddles never get as good as they are in this game
[3:56:15] <%Asuterisuku> They're optional, but they provide a lot of cool info.
[3:56:22] <+Damie904> Dude we dont want you to. Do em if they're convenient for ez exp, but fuck the riddles.
[3:56:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @seniormeatbox what did he miss? Afaik all riddles are obtainable
[3:56:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Damn even Joker wants Woolie to do puzzles
[3:56:24] <brian_peppers1> MASH KING
[3:56:25] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @WoolieVersus also most of the key character art and designs were handled by Calos D'Anda who worked on DCUO and drew a few of the Wildstorm Resident Evil comics
[3:56:25] <%KyoryUtchy> If he thought it was Gordon until just now, then he straight up lied to Oracle when she asked if he found Gordon yet.
[3:56:27] <GarbageNirvana> At least you don't need them for the real ending in this one
[3:56:29] <Dante_Namikaze1> it's only worth it in Arkham City because you can see how you fuck him up and it's tied to sing the ending for Arkham Knight but the only one where you could do it quickly was in Arkham origins
[3:56:32] <peachy996> @penitentpendant No he can go back for them
[3:56:39] <seniormeatbox> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Morgue room can't be re-entered.
[3:56:41] <PanicSwytch> Its understandable but I had fun hunting the puzzles
[3:56:41] <Yung_FckUp> do a 100x combo
[3:56:41] <+mister___doctor> I feel like attention is what the Riddler wants anyway
[3:56:43] <meganicmp3> the amadeus arkham logs are cool tho
[3:56:43] <%Deft_Thought> These SFX are somethin
[3:56:45] <%mundanelotus> It helps not to spam the buttons one after the other but keep a rhythm
[3:56:46] <%Asuterisuku> Also, nothing is permanently missable.
[3:56:47] <Doctadaking> Mashing too much. Be more deliberate with your presses
[3:56:55] <Depthcharge2030> that man was contorted into the floor
[3:56:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't remember if it;s this game or the next one, but theres a really good Beatdown combo after a stun that I love using
[3:56:59] <user_naim> Don’t mash, you have time
[3:57:02] <%runegod20> joker must spend a fortune on those teeth
[3:57:02] <MAX116030> I feel like Woolie masehes the melee when he should press like ritm game
[3:57:04] <%jiggy_snipe> people say hit confirm, Woolie Kappa
[3:57:04] <Johannen> Do Combo get more Style
[3:57:09] <s1rcuit> I remember them damaging you for some reason
[3:57:10] <KidKaiser23> This is not Ninja Storm, no need to mash
[3:57:11] <+evbites> @ShinobiPhoenix it's this one
[3:57:12] <brachydios777> This game’s soundtrack is very batman 89
[3:57:14] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[3:57:29] <%CptnCampy61> @shinobiphoenix The rapid punch one? I think that was city
[3:57:30] <andre11dr> Im pretty sure it's the same model Woolie
[3:57:31] <+Walopoh> Are you a messiah?
[3:57:34] <+SvenHolgersson> Woolie Stares At Bench
[3:57:36] <+runegod20> it works pretty well for an old and beaten up wooden chair
[3:57:36] <Shardlab> I got creeped out playing certain parts of the game at first and then came to a realization: "I'm Batman. I'm the scariest damned thing in this game."
[3:57:37] <TraitGene2> every time i look at a block of wood i think, "look at how low poly this is"
[3:57:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was playing City and I use the move a lot, but you have it by default, so I couldn;t remember if you have to buy it in this one and it's default in City
[3:57:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[3:57:45] <dukenux> Do you like The Carpenters?

[3:57:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:57:51] <diontmack> woolie the low poly seat respecter
[3:57:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @seniormeatbox really? is it Great Whites and Solomon? Afaik riddle is obtainable post game
[3:57:55] <YVESSAINTMORON_> Looks like a stretched chair without the back rest

[3:59:49] <Lancaster_H> did woolie manage to get lost in a straight road again
[3:59:50] <+Wildorox> Did you like Batman’s fight style in the Injustice games Woolie?
[3:59:53] <%ChoculaUltra> woolieFABRICATION
[3:59:53] <%krispen_wa> so if batman and his batfamily die, would superman just do double duty and save gotham himself
[3:59:59] <+gnoame> Gordon Freeman = Joker confirmed
[4:00:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Go with Ivy Harley, she's better for you
[4:00:11] <%Asuterisuku> Predator mission GO!
[4:00:18] <%Parapattern> "Bruce, I forgive you for not saving me. But why, why on God's earth is HE still alive?!"
[4:00:18] <+evbites> @krispen_wa nah somone else would step up
[4:00:18] <andre11dr> Gordon vs Terry is a 10-0 matchup
[4:00:21] <Dante_Namikaze1> @krispen_wa you would have to kill like 20 people for their not to be a Batman replacement before Superman even steps in
[4:00:22] <dinnydanny777> Gordon kind of on his shit talking  A game
[4:00:27] <meganicmp3> hide
[4:00:36] <amiavamp> Why did we never get an actual Predator game like this?

[4:00:45] <%jonblnt> vents

[4:00:48] <%krispen_wa> so we gotta kill 20 people before gotham is saved from being a shithole then. thats a decent sacrifice
[4:00:50] <Daxalog> When your unconscious or asleep your skeleton turns blue.
[4:00:52] <NoireRequiem> lo
[4:00:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fun fact: the only reason that crowbar happened is because of a phone poll, and it seems that a ton of votes came from one salty fan abusing the system.

[4:02:05] <coreybom> @krispen_wa Dude you think Batman is the reason for the bullshit? Guys like penguin, scarecrow and others would still be there.
[4:02:06] <+gnoame> "I'm going to die"
[4:02:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> schlapschtick
[4:02:08] <andre11dr> That Spiderman game ia some next level if shit LUL
[4:02:09] <pirateofpie> @DatAsuna Wait, it does?!
[4:02:10] <Hammatime8> Spider-Man 3 has so many good QTE fails
[4:02:10] <$tallik44123> yeah ivy probably beats her slightly less but not by much
[4:02:12] <%Ether101_Prime> But does Woolie know about the big arm?
[4:02:15] <meganicmp3> notice the body strung up
[4:02:15] <mortificent> chat, Joker and Harley qualify as war criminals with their bodycount, right?
[4:02:17] <+Undenizen> There's a very awkward one with Killer Croc because they're trying to censor him eating your face.
[4:02:19] <+Walopoh> She says "I'M GONNA DIE" jermaMars
[4:02:26] <%krispen_wa> @coreybom yeah but superman would stop them waaaaay faster than batman's slow ass
[4:02:31] <%Asuterisuku> Their vision really is garbage, though, and that' sfrom someone who's legally blind.
[4:02:33] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Doctadaking
[4:02:34] <agustorm123> She is so obnoxius
[4:02:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I feel like I've seen this exact room in Arkham City
[4:02:39] <+MattDemers> I enjoy how Woolie is now absorbed in the metagame of "never turn Detective Vision off"
[4:02:41] <KidKaiser23> @tallik44123 No, Ivy BEATS IT UP, she does not beat her up
[4:02:46] <%Parapattern> @mortificent Yeah, that's true with every Batman villain
[4:02:48] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL

[4:02:54] <LordOfThePoultry> WHAT
[4:02:54] <mr_red117> BLIND
[4:03:01] <Murdercles> its not their fault, they need Big Boss' remains to fix their shitting genome vision
[4:03:03] <Lancaster_H> that guard is almost as blind as woolie
[4:03:04] <+taggerung403> joker only hires clowns
[4:03:05] <+Undenizen> he's very short sighted.
[4:03:06] <penitentpendant> I think LoS for them is from Center of Mass?
[4:03:08] <%runegod20> @mortificent Oh, well beyond kill count, easily jeneva convention broken 5 times over
[4:03:08] <@Solidus_113> that skeleton...
[4:03:09] <Pyrrhus90> a clown? so on brand?
[4:03:10] <Uncle_Christian> Glaucoma
[4:03:17] <mr_saturday93> Woolie/Paige levels of blind
[4:03:19] <Daxalog> Unless its like Arma. Or splinter cell.
[4:03:22] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus turn detective mode off near the floating skeleton
[4:03:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Real life peripheral vision makes it too tough
[4:03:26] <velgaduere> there's a realism mod for MGSV and it is NOT fucking fun lmao
[4:03:27] <meganicmp3> be patient?
[4:03:27] <rytisone> there's tons of things that would make games not fun
[4:03:31] <amiavamp> Try MGS5 with boosted sight range, it's near impossible
[4:03:34] <%Halospaz117> But I want hard stealth game tho
[4:03:44] <tattleworm> that's why you gotta have a camo index
[4:03:44] <%Asuterisuku> Has Woolie figured out who's in the cell yet?
[4:03:45] <%SainEdge> yeah, real world stealth would be terrible
[4:03:48] <+Walopoh> LUL
[4:03:49] <%runegod20> yeah, if you do realisitc sight, sound, an enemies getting alerted, stealth would be too hard
[4:03:50] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Optional realistic los could be fun. Like, if you give your stealth game a "simulator" difficulty or something
[4:03:51] <mortificent> yeye, I always like to remember that these villains are aaaawful people
[4:03:54] <+Superbro64> You'd be impressed how stupid humans can actually be at noticing things woolie
[4:04:03] <DelgotHansto> Thief nearly did it, the good ones at least
[4:04:10] <+SWindleFeD> Yeah playing Sniper: ghost warrior 1 on hard mode makes the enemies eye sight go into super mode
[4:04:10] <meganicmp3> forget it its not important
[4:04:13] <+condemned_15> cheep cheep cheep
[4:04:13] <%TubeMan642> that's Bane in there
[4:04:13] <coward_man> like how realistically in the distances shooters take place a shotgun would be god king of the universe?
[4:04:15] <+evbites> Stairs
[4:04:16] <Doctadaking> Just take the stairs
[4:04:21] <TraitGene2> stairs at the back
[4:04:21] <%Halospaz117> Or at the very least gimme Chaos Theory level stealth, FUCK I MISS SPLINTER CELL
[4:04:22] <snakest3alth> Stairs
[4:04:22] <mr_red117> stairs
[4:04:22] <specialpipo> Oof
[4:04:23] <+Undenizen> "Won again"?? when has he EVER won??
[4:04:23] <Johannen> Nice heart monitor tech, I wonder if he even shared it with the world
[4:04:25] <dinnydanny777> I think realistic stealth would push you into not engaging in combat at all
[4:04:26] <Komayeda> There are LITERALLY Stairs
[4:04:27] <+Walopoh> Stairs
[4:04:28] <ScreamLord> I was about to say MGS would be torture with realistic site range
[4:04:29] <brunoberserk> NotLikeThis
[4:04:30] <user_naim> stairs
[4:04:35] <Fuji808> cheep cheep cheep cheeeeeeep
[4:04:35] <%sirisvirus> you could just use the stairs
[4:04:36] <Lancaster_H> NotLikeThis
[4:04:41] <BlackermanZX> Batman never takes the stairs
[4:04:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Again?
[4:04:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Real stealth: You get sighted once and the place is on high alert for a week.
[4:04:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> OH NO

[4:08:48] <OblivionSword1> Are you sure you're not cursed Woolie ?
[4:08:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Are soft-locks the same class as save-corruption? Does it depend on whether manual saves exist?
[4:08:55] <TheChapyGuy> I've never seen that, and I've almost only played on PC
[4:08:56] <+DrPoxx> might be a detective vision bug
[4:08:57] <peachy996> I think it was the sudden roll for the trophy that did it
[4:08:57] <dundore77> deactivate detective mode before doing it
[4:08:57] <Pyrrhus90> woolie is QA powers are out of control

[4:09:08] <TreeLeafBoi> You never truly leave QA
[4:09:09] <+CptBritches> Pretty sure the bug happened due to switching detective vision during the animation
[4:09:13] <TheWizardOfWordplay> don't use detective mode for the takedown

[4:09:22] <%HitchhikingThrough> The important question: CAN IT BE REPLICATED
[4:09:24] <mdkcde> this seems like an anti-crack feature
[4:09:25] <Doctadaking> The second you hit the takedown prompt, it’s supposed to cut to a prerendered cutscene
[4:09:27] <wruce__billis> @Mattais88 They bugged the fuck outta the dragon god fight
[4:09:29] <+nightwing1936> Turn off Detective Mode for that takedown woolz
[4:09:29] <%C0baltCrusade> [BRING ME TO LIFE] Act 2: [Bedbugs and Ballyhoo]

[4:10:52] <dukenux> ...Bane?
[4:10:53] <diontmack> YOU'RE A SMALL GUY
[4:10:54] <dinnydanny777> Is that JENOVA LUL
[4:10:54] <peachy996> This Bane design... sucks

[4:10:57] <snakest3alth> Bame looks like doghsit
[4:10:58] <%kewlmyc> FOR YOU
[4:11:00] <PanicSwytch> BRUJA
[4:11:02] <+PikeBot> I think they must have Harley skinned over a grunt, since you can't really see her anyway, so that you can trigger the takedown prompt. Once the cutscene starts they swap her out for herself. But the cutscene never happened so there was just Grunt Harley sitting there forever.
[4:11:02] <%krispen_wa> UUUU

[4:14:13] <Dante_Namikaze1> @dizzygunner everyone in that is saying the same thing

[4:17:27] <%kewlmyc> Quit getting greedy. Put down your shield.
[4:17:39] <%Asuterisuku> ... I think I actually forgot how Batman and Robin went, guys.
[4:17:39] <+SolidusRex> Did Bane say "I will fuck you"?
[4:17:40] <Johannen> @KeiganOfAstora Not City? What about Freeze? I though Origins was prety generic
[4:17:42] <%krispen_wa> arkham origins is a great game that had some questionable gameplay decisions
[4:17:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> When you get real smooth with the combat it looks so brutal. Arkham Origins has some of the coolest predator rooms too
[4:17:44] <Jane_Lo> is this the original release or that remaster collection? cause i think original is more blue-ish, right?
[4:17:49] <mudamudajo> @asuterisuku no. I'm just referring to the Clooney batman film that bane appeared in.

[4:18:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Jane_Lo PC original
[4:18:14] <%Deft_Thought> Bane getting reduced from the "Man who broke the Bat" in Knightfall to a muscle goon or a jobber for the League of Assassins was always such a disappointment.

[4:23:21] <coldfire0007> He has his own gravitational force

[4:23:23] <mortificent> Bane is super smart
[4:23:27] <+Javaa01> 4 U
[4:23:35] <Condor6425> origins makes Bane a little more interesting, but he's pretty much dumb muscle man in the first few games
[4:23:36] <+Robob00p> In Arkham knight it days he’s a badass even without his venom
[4:23:36] <mudamudajo> Thats bullshit. Without venom he's still a huge dude. He trained his body in prison before venom.

[4:24:10] <brachydios777> Bane was scared of Bats, so beating Batman is beating his fears
[4:24:11] <penitentpendant> If this game has proven anything, comic book writers weren't aware of the Square/Cube law for a while
[4:24:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> calling someone from South America Mexican is legit actually racist

[4:24:33] <pirateofpie> He has a Batcave on the moon
[4:24:34] <aurasviel> Woolie there’s a Batcave in YOUR APARTMENT RIGHT NOW
[4:24:34] <%runegod20> at least batman making a secondary bat cave on arkham isn't super crazy
[4:24:35] <Uncle_Christian> Batman is the most paranoid man ever,he plans for anything n everything.
[4:24:35] <PKSomething> How much prep time does Kevin get?
[4:24:36] <Wild_Samurai> Love this part of the game. Retreat to your secret Bat Cave lol
[4:24:37] <passserby> bear would win versus gorilla
[4:24:37] <rytisone> Batman always expects the worst
[4:24:38] <+CptBritches> Batman could beat Goku with prep time

[4:24:47] <%krispen_wa> Okay, but what if Batman with time to plan fights Flash who travels back in time
[4:24:48] <gunsrlove> Eh, it's not much different to when JoJo characters keep out-predicting each other in every single fight.
[4:24:49] <%Wulfphelz> Batman TTP, truly the ultimate being LUL
[4:24:49] <%Juriasu> Woolie knows LUL
[4:24:52] <%Halospaz117> Batman has a batcave in Castle Superbeast
[4:24:54] <+samuraiknack> Batman or Lupin the third?
[4:24:55] <huskarl_zap> Pat cried for daigo
[4:24:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but not Scarlet Witch
[4:24:56] <slix3431> Woolie took a round
[4:24:58] <Komayeda> I thought he was talking about Daigo from Yakuza
[4:24:58] <DomonTrigger> Woolie after eating 4 shoryukens in a row
[4:24:58] <Rafoki> ok out of all the pre-planned johns that batman has. Having a base on Arkham is the most realistic
[4:24:59] <ThatGuyThere03> Superman off rip isn't that strong
[4:24:59] <+mister___doctor> Goku wants to kill Batman but Batman already has the Dragon Balls
[4:25:01] <majindusto> Bane, Played by Tom Hardy...who would  eventually  play VENOM

[4:25:14] <bevyrage> i don't think batman with time to plan beats daigo with time to study
[4:25:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> The plan is just Kyrptonite, that's not exactly a master plan LUL
[4:25:15] <drk_sd> batman would macro his buttons

[4:25:16] <redrins> pre or post download daigo?
[4:25:17] <Condor6425> I thought Daigo was superman?
[4:25:20] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> He didn't think things were bad enough to mention the Arkham Asylum batcave until now
[4:25:21] <RyuuAoi> If Batman can plan, he wins.
[4:25:22] <TraitGene2> has a batcave on arkham, still can't figure out how everyone always escapes
[4:25:23] <%runegod20> if he was gonna have one anywhere, this is probably the best place
[4:25:29] <user_naim> Batman with time to plan has the world as his utility belt

[4:25:42] <+mister___doctor> Cape physics
[4:25:43] <@Solidus_113> don't mash
[4:25:46] <Yung_FckUp> do big combo
[4:25:51] <%Asuterisuku> The mashing is wild.
[4:25:53] <T_Sasquatch> seriously counters are eas y as fuck lmao
[4:25:55] <KidKaiser23> @generalscpatton Fax, and that movie sucks
[4:25:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:25:56] <%ChoculaUltra> "Post-Download Daigo" is def getting added to the tier list LUL
[4:25:56] <brunoberserk> god , woolie is mashing like a fucking musou
[4:25:57] <meganicmp3> greedy counter man
[4:25:57] <+Superbro64> hit him harder 4Head
[4:25:59] <LordOfThePoultry> don't mash
[4:26:00] <+CloudsBringRain> woolie mash is off the charts rn
[4:26:02] <Exodusprime1256> SLAP slap slap, clap clap clap
[4:26:03] <dinnydanny777> SourPls
[4:26:06] <slix3431> This combat music is nicer
[4:26:06] <TraitGene2> does he have the ORAORA yet
[4:26:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @dukenux it's Xenatos, the trope itself makes that clear
[4:26:11] <EmptyFist> lol why are you making it so hard
[4:26:11] <+TechnoSyndrome> he's just figuring out how it works
[4:26:12] <Doctadaking> You have a lot more time to counter than you think.
[4:26:13] <+sevorai> @WoolieVersus the combat is a rhythm game
[4:26:15] <%mundanelotus> I got stuck waiting to counter and it messed up my combos
[4:26:17] <coreybom> @th3smartalec Thats if supes isn’t ACTUALLY trying to kill him. If supes wanted actually dead, kryptonite can’t stop him.
[4:26:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie its a rhythm game, think of it like a rhythm game
[4:26:18] <therealtacopancakes> this is a rhytm game, see blue press y
[4:26:18] <majindusto> SO MUCH  DROPPED  COMBOS
[4:26:23] <T_Sasquatch> NOPE counter literally overrides any attack
[4:26:24] <@Solidus_113> you're buffering in extra attacks that'll miss
[4:26:24] <+evbites> combat is a bit of a mess in thease games
[4:26:26] <capnqwark> RHYTHM YES
[4:26:27] <andre11dr> Man,vampire Batman is so dumb but kinda cool
[4:26:27] <MAX116030> yeah combat has a ritm to it
[4:26:30] <Lancaster_H> @WoolieVersus you whiff once = your combo is gone
[4:26:35] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Mashing drops your combo
[4:26:38] <%kewlmyc> Rhythm is the key word
[4:26:40] <dinnydanny777> I think you can cancel into counter
[4:26:43] <peachy996> City's Combat Challenges are fun. Iceberg Lounge is wild
[4:26:44] <dundore77> Its a lower/older form of the Shadow of Mordor system if you played that
[4:26:44] <deviljhojho_> avoiding counters unless they are necessary and switching enemies around for extra mobiity is the key i think
[4:26:45] <%Asuterisuku> The reason not to is that the combo drops and you can't do your big special moves.
[4:26:46] <YVESSAINTMORON_> Arkham knight = mash mash mash mash counter
[4:26:48] <DrkJP520> Timing your attacks is best. Same in Shadow of Mordor
[4:26:49] <@Solidus_113> dropping the combo means no takedown
[4:26:50] <+AnIrishPapaya> Mashing literally drops all combos and buffs sooo
[4:26:51] <+TheTyper> Reason: Cause perfect timing feels perfect in this game
[4:26:53] <PinoProxie> PREPARED
[4:26:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Higher rhythm combo makes the enemies drop faster
[4:26:55] <user_naim> You can get stuck in an attack, but often you have time
[4:26:57] <@akuda_bar> creepy squatter batman
[4:26:58] <%Seancicle> they deserve to live Woolie
[4:26:58] <Uncle_Christian> Batman was able to dodge Lord Darkseid's Omega Beam.
[4:26:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Good to know you're looking out for the inmates and not the guards, Batman
[4:27:01] <+JacknZack27> Its a lot of fun to get into the rhythm of the fights
[4:27:01] <Komayeda> Oh, just the ol' Arkham Asylum Suicide Ledge
[4:27:01] <kamenspidey> keep mashin' don't listen to anybody you do you
[4:27:01] <coward_man> no mash, also counter cancels out your attack
[4:27:12] <meganicmp3> he is LEARNING
[4:27:12] <+Javaa01> Also mashing counter kills your combo
[4:27:12] <Condor6425> is Woolie planning planning on doing other games in the Arkham series?
[4:27:13] <majindusto> DO COMBO
[4:27:17] <%Wulfphelz> It's stupid how it's actually a good explanation on why he has a second batcave LUL
[4:27:20] <%LCLSmoothie> do combo!
[4:27:23] <penitentpendant> Learnin' the system~
[4:27:25] <+RJay80> doodMash mash harder
[4:27:26] <+Walopoh> 4Head
[4:27:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Because mashing leaves you open
[4:27:28] <deviljhojho_> 4Head
[4:27:29] <%big_laser_boss> Maybe if you use the Quick-change clothes.... alright I'm out
[4:27:30] <Doctadaking> In harder difficulties, the blue indicators go away on enemies
[4:27:31] <ralphfromdk> Also... if I remember right, higher combo means more xp?
[4:27:32] <SixthSun2> Sure it was, Edward
[4:27:32] <+chosenjuan42> Is Woolie gonna Lab Arkham?
[4:27:33] <+AnIrishPapaya> "learning"
[4:27:33] <Rojahh> Lab it in your own time woolie
[4:27:33] <mortificent> Fuck you Riddler
[4:27:36] <T_Sasquatch> Woolie Mashen
[4:27:38] <MAX116030> Woolie do you mash in spiderman game?
[4:27:38] <TheSmerdis> The critical combo is way stronger and requires NOT to mash
[4:27:38] <%Mrthefro> It's so smart. Some moves tied to combo so keep it high.
[4:27:40] <$emptyantics> I hope you guys play the best Batman game, AkrhamOrigins
[4:27:41] <+CloudsBringRain> you don't get to use that upgrade you got for double damage when you mash
[4:27:42] <%Asuterisuku> The map you got is only for inside the Medical Pavillion.
[4:27:46] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Better take another look at those critical hits, cause you have landed maybe 2 accidentally
[4:27:48] <rytisone> lets hide all the high tech stuff on the island that an escaped inmate could find. great plan batman
[4:27:49] <Johannen> Losing counter>Less Specials and Big Combo>More XP
[4:27:51] <peachy996> Nah it won't
[4:27:55] <+evbites> the riddler trophies in city are mandatory because the interviews are god tier
[4:27:56] <alvaroeltz> Woolie, batman doenst have electricity
[4:27:57] <BoSteed> Batman's battle damage during this game blew my mind back then.
[4:27:58] <+bearwagon> nah u can just grapply away
[4:27:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[4:28:00] <meganicmp3> it will believe in it
[4:28:01] <Lancaster_H> also, higher your combo = longer your range becomes, you can leap entire rooms at 30+ combo counts @WoolieVersus
[4:28:01] <PanicSwytch> Dont double tap
[4:28:02] <penitentpendant> Rebel Up
[4:28:07] <ShiningAxis> damn the riddler is hella good at climbing
[4:28:10] <amiavamp> That's just like any game with "double tap direction to dodge". turn that shit off whenever you're in a game with it
[4:28:11] <Timothyer> Only Chinese Batman has electricity
[4:28:14] <+Superbro64> If Riddler thinks he's smart, why doesnt he name every riddle? jiyuTurnt
[4:28:24] <+DizzyGunner> woolie finding more reasons not to mash Kappa
[4:28:24] <Doctadaking> Health. Health. Health.
[4:28:25] <velgaduere> it's not that unintuitive, thankfully
[4:28:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> So as long as you're not... Mashing? LUL
[4:28:26] <alvaroeltz> Just dont mash A
[4:28:30] <meganicmp3> mashing on the collectibles too
[4:28:34] <SheefEatsBeef> oh, you like riddles? name every riddle then
[4:28:34] <@Solidus_113> that's good
[4:28:36] <NeonBleu> so...no mashing Kappa
[4:28:37] <Johannen> Your Combo counter is literaly your style meter
[4:28:41] <coward_man> @Superbro64 if you asked him to he would
[4:28:43] <peachy996> That's good too
[4:28:45] <majindusto> More Combo =  More Attacks
[4:28:49] <WanderingSwordsman> If you pay attention, you'll notice Batman's costume get increasing battle damage over time
[4:28:50] <ireliaismaiwaifu> so... stop mashing?
[4:28:50] <%ZweihanderSteve> warg
[4:28:51] <+sovietbatman64> Yo this layout looks fresh
[4:28:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the sucky part is this game doesnt have the good lab training, the later games lets you do challenges that are good for labbing the combat
[4:28:54] <thefranchise00> that art looks sick tho
[4:28:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> 5 instead of 8? Shadow of Mordor literally has that!
[4:28:55] <+PikeBot> If you use the doidge towards enemies, you'll dodge over them, which will preserve your combo count. YOu can do any number of dodge-overs without losing your combo, but only one regular dodge.
[4:29:05] <%LCLSmoothie> batman is losing his mind in that art lol
[4:29:06] <moonmintparadise> Kreygasm
[4:29:06] <velgaduere> @GeneralSCPatton :)
[4:29:08] <deviljhojho_> yeah dodge overs are king
[4:29:09] <dinnydanny777> I thought Batman's screaming mouth was some kind of abyss
[4:29:11] <brunoberserk> batman screams to level up his armor LUL
[4:29:18] <peachy996> Health Upgrades are not a waste for you
[4:29:19] <%ChoculaUltra> Batman looks so done with bullets in that art
[4:29:22] <SheefEatsBeef> Da na na na na na!
[4:29:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[4:29:23] <+PlagueOfGripes> oh shit, you're finally playing this
[4:29:23] <PanicSwytch> Batman has multiple Bat caves
[4:29:23] <Darren716> Do you blame him for having it?
[4:29:23] <dukenux> "Aaaahhhh"
[4:29:24] <coreybom> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli But this one has challenges as well?
[4:29:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ITS SUPER SECRET

[4:29:33] <LVL1_Scumbag> BIG SECRETS
[4:29:34] <Doctadaking> When you see where it is, you’ll see how no one discovered it.
[4:29:37] <Dante_Namikaze1> No because it's really out of the way
[4:29:37] <+Damie904> You'll see why
[4:29:38] <%marrs_bars> Well they did, and the Bat Security "knocked them out"
[4:29:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @WanderingSwordsman only this game, not so much City or Knight, especially if you use some of the DLC costumes
[4:29:41] <+MikeNmurdoc> $15 an hour Woolie!!!
[4:29:41] <%jonblnt> not paid enough to look for a batcave
[4:29:43] <velgaduere> depends on where you find it
[4:29:43] <Blank9> $15/hr isn't enough to find a bat cave
[4:29:43] <andre11dr> NO ,HE THAT GOOD AT HIDING IT
[4:29:46] <majindusto> IT'S  A SECRET
[4:29:46] <+chosenjuan42> planned ahead
[4:29:52] <%jiggy_snipe> in Robot Chicken, his maid finds the normal batcave
[4:29:53] <%Feralspirit41> They get paid $15 an hour are they really gonna tell BATMAN he cant do something
[4:29:53] <penitentpendant> Woolie's figurin' it out!
[4:29:54] <ULTRA__64> He's got a knive! doodTerror
[4:29:54] <peachy996> Knife Boys are a challenge
[4:29:58] <KidKaiser23> Do you think Arkham pays their guards enough to be thorough, Woolie?
[4:30:02] <+condemned_15> My MIIIIND
[4:30:02] <+Walopoh> It's pretty well hidden tbf LUL
[4:30:02] <%Asuterisuku> Can't counter knife attacs until the next game.
[4:30:03] <Frostydough1> all the accidental discoveries ended up in accidental fatal injuries soon after
[4:30:04] <Doctadaking> Ground finishers aren’t worth it
[4:30:05] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie for the love of god user your counters
[4:30:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @coreybom it does but the combat challenges in this game isnt as well defined as later games, believe me this is my favorite Arkham game but its also the most "early" version of the combat
[4:30:07] <alvaroeltz> Also, he found it by aciddent
[4:30:07] <BoSteed> NotLikeThis
[4:30:09] <EmptyFist> B
[4:30:09] <vnzuelandude> this game is 2009 right?
[4:30:09] <+DizzyGunner> knives when you get the upgrade are easy
[4:30:10] <Darren716> Yes
[4:30:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you find the Batcave, you hope he'll hire you instead
[4:30:13] <+mister___doctor> @WoolieVersus Always stop to counter when you see the blue, you'll keep your combo going
[4:30:14] <+Javaa01> It will always interrupt
[4:30:16] <OblivionSword1> yeas actually
[4:30:16] <xmetalicdemonx> yes
[4:30:16] <+TheTyper> You can hold dodge to avoid the knife boys that are red
[4:30:17] <coward_man> no just dodge
[4:30:17] <mr_red117> yes
[4:30:18] <%LCLSmoothie> yes
[4:30:19] <%Halospaz117> It always stuns, yes
[4:30:21] <zedravan> 15$/hr woolie
[4:30:22] <thebalticguy1> It is not a counter
[4:30:23] <+sevorai> B always interrupts @WoolieVersus
[4:30:26] <keankong85> stun or dodge red attacks
[4:30:27] <capnqwark> Yes
[4:30:28] <coreybom> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Oh yeah true. Very true.
[4:30:33] <+Walopoh> Just wait...
[4:30:35] <+Birdro> B is a stun attack, not counter based
[4:30:37] <peachy996> @TheTyper I always found that dodge weird.
[4:30:38] <+JacknZack27> Yeah. You can do it at anytime
[4:30:38] <BoSteed> NO ONE EVER
[4:30:38] <Uncle_Christian> wait for it
[4:30:38] <penitentpendant> "Electrocution" oh right. Those enemies...

[4:30:42] <@Commando_Joe> Alright I gotta step out, but the rest of the mods have their safeties off, so watch yourselves chat
[4:30:44] <SheefEatsBeef> the moss is batman shaped....

[4:31:19] <RedSqurrl> Ajunta Pall??
[4:31:20] <+TheTyper> @peachy996 It totally is. But I think it's a mite faster if you're on the last second of a knife attack vs. a cape swing. The cape swing has to dive in before it lands.

[4:40:58] <Uncle_Christian> "Why did I put those crates there"?
[4:40:58] <+GerryOmega> there goes thousands of dollars of waynetech

[4:50:21] <+Javaa01> You really wanna tempt fate like that, we already know this port is not stable
[4:50:21] <Tooniearcade> Lol
[4:50:21] <meganicmp3> that means you beat his quest line
[4:50:22] <%bread_assassin> Then why'd you put it there, Riddler?
[4:50:22] <Prevot> just don't grab them LUL
[4:50:23] <+TheTyper> THAT would be considered beating the Riddler at his own game
[4:50:23] <andre11dr> Nah ,fuck the Riddler
[4:50:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Riddler is Anti-Woolie Tech
[4:50:27] <+Hick12> Please don't, he's the best part of this game.
[4:50:27] <Condor6425> let the hatred flow through you woolie
[4:50:27] <+condemned_15> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:50:28] <oddbunker> Riddler stops that shit in the other games
[4:50:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> Is there a mod to make encouraging things play instead?
[4:50:28] <DrkJP520> His lines are hard coded.
[4:50:30] <+CptBritches> That's the biggest riddle of all. You'll only be playing right into his game
[4:50:31] <+Nomad_Scholar> Imagine if the Riddler lines where hardcoded in
[4:50:32] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[4:50:32] <TheChapyGuy> anti-Riddler tech
[4:50:33] <KetsuoTaberu> replace all the audio with lines like "you're doing a great job Batman :) "
[4:50:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You see the patience Batman has just to not throttle Riddler everytime? DUDE IS A SAINT
[4:50:38] <dinnydanny777> I mean, the intent is to annoy you LUL
[4:50:38] <rosemon5001> and the game would go no play for you
[4:50:43] <Uncle_Christian> Replace them with "Woolie Taunt"
[4:50:48] <SpookyMooks> go back to where you picked up the last one
[4:50:48] <Johannen> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:50:50] <stinkerfist> is this PC?
[4:50:51] <%Asuterisuku> You can see another trophy from there too.
[4:50:54] <+funnyfunnykid> Mods of Nigma groveling over how cool you are at finding easy to discover trophies is required
[4:50:54] <s1rcuit> @BoSteed you'd be too fighting Gotham's worst for many years, only to be forced to semi-retire after one of them cripples you with a bullet
[4:50:54] <phatmac16> Is there an anti-riddler mod
[4:51:00] <clack14> evoTilt PunOko
[4:51:03] <+Javaa01> @stinkerfist Yeah he's playing the PC port
[4:51:05] <+Undenizen> Woolie, I am telling you now, fuck that particular trophy.
[4:51:05] <peachy996> I don't think there's a Mod where Riddler praises you Woolie
[4:51:08] <Doctadaking> That’s for later
[4:51:12] <dukenux> @ketsuotaberu "wow Batman, you're so smart PogChamp "
[4:51:12] <+condemned_15> thats for later

[4:51:18] <Darren716> I think you need an upgrade

[4:51:26] <%C0baltCrusade> need time stop

[4:51:31] <%ChoculaUltra> oh it really is a metroidvania
[4:51:33] <invalidarg56> Time stop
[4:51:33] <KetsuoTaberu> @dukenux LUL
[4:51:35] <Depthcharge2030> that's for backtracking
[4:51:39] <KaiserMario> Metroidvanias

[4:51:40] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> SCREWATTACK
[4:51:41] <papertoonz1414> need time stop for that one
[4:51:42] <$eco419> time stop
[4:51:45] <bevyrage> woolie was looking right at a solution
[4:51:49] <user_naim> you grapple them in City, but not here
[4:51:52] <meganicmp3> you can get one of those by shimmying
[4:51:55] <brunoberserk> use the batclaw
[4:52:02] <The_Nightmare_Emperor> I mean they're free xp but that's about it
[4:52:03] <amiavamp> man batman got weird when he started wearing a maid dress and carrying a pocket watch around
[4:52:04] <SpookyMooks> batclaw it
[4:52:04] <+Hick12> Remember that you can come back to areas, so you don't have to get all of them now.
[4:52:12] <+nightwing1936> You can batclaw that one
[4:52:12] <%ChoculaUltra> wait time stop? I mean fuck it - not about to argue whether or not Batman could achieve time travel.
[4:52:13] <%Asuterisuku> There's a lot of retextures, I'm not seeing any audio mods.
[4:52:15] <Uncle_Christian> Use Megaman
[4:52:15] <+chosenjuan42> try claw again
[4:52:19] <invalidarg56> Timestop
[4:52:19] <+funnyfunnykid> You need to get "Bat Blink" (tm) to shift across ledges
[4:52:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:52:21] <velgaduere> BUT THEN HE WINS
[4:52:22] <Darren716> Big brain moves
[4:52:23] <+bigb00gi3> but it's free exp
[4:52:25] <Condor6425> can you not batclaw riddler trophies in the first game?
[4:52:26] <Iwashi94> but the mind goblins tho
[4:52:26] <dekkitout> True psaCrazyhand
[4:52:31] <NoireRequiem> well you'd think that...
[4:52:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> IF YOU DON'T COLLECT EM HE WINS
[4:52:34] <peachy996> Even if you were to finish the game, you can still come back
[4:52:34] <+Superbro64> "NIGMA DEEZ NUTS"
[4:52:36] <user_naim> Or wait, can you claw them here as well?
[4:52:40] <jorniev> looks like batman needs to unlock time stop before getting going through this path
[4:52:40] <Dante_Namikaze1> No, he will still call you
[4:52:41] <meganicmp3> nigma balls
[4:52:43] <ireliaismaiwaifu> "i can make this jump"

[4:53:11] <Doctadaking> Naw, Croc’s not evil enough to be Vince
[4:53:12] <%Irridium> wasn't it just supposed to be a skin condition with him?

[4:54:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:54:08] <Johannen> Woolie would sacrifice xp gain and more upgrades so he could ignore riddler)
[4:54:11] <Iwashi94> I found the proper riddles pretty fun tbh
[4:54:13] <dukenux> HOWDY DIDLY DOO BATMAN
[4:54:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Johannen That speaks volumes
[4:54:18] <Doctadaking> I guarantee that those won’t be completed on stream, Woolie. Too much backtracking
[4:54:30] <dinnydanny777> Could you see through that wall there?
[4:54:32] <+Superbro64> I do not miss the age of games stretching the "dollar to hour" ratio
[4:54:32] <%Asuterisuku> Each gadget has its own dedicated shortcut.
[4:54:32] <dundore77> i only ever found them all in Knight and i regret it utterly

[4:54:42] <bear_breaker20> riddler sux
[4:54:44] <coward_man> it was for the time
[4:54:45] <wruce__billis> it was impressive back then
[4:54:45] <velgaduere> I played this on release, it definitely was
[4:54:47] <RealDurdyDan> Oh it was
[4:54:47] <xmetalicdemonx> hey someone worked hard on that
[4:54:47] <+BritishTyrannosaur> shut up it's cool
[4:54:47] <penitentpendant> Wait, HOW did the mooks get down there?
[4:54:48] <+Nomad_Scholar> It was, you had to be there
[4:54:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> it was for the time
[4:54:53] <+Hick12> This was one of the first PhysX enhanced games.
[4:54:54] <+TheTyper> It was kinda impressive, but more importantly: Everyone thought it was the future.
[4:54:56] <somedude1013> Woolie stop making me feel old
[4:55:00] <+RJay80> does it always gatta be a bwt pattern batman? YES
[4:55:03] <%Asuterisuku> 12 years ago. It was pretty impressive back then.
[4:55:03] <+Javaa01> It ran on an X360 *at* a framerate, it was relatively impressive
[4:55:03] <Doctadaking> Arkham City overdid Riddler trophies so hard that Arkham Knight scaled it down
[4:55:06] <%cursedwithadhd> Nah Arkham City was full of stretching gameplay with riddles
[4:55:10] <+Zeromaru2> I gotta go. Thanks for the stream guys good luck
[4:55:12] <+CptBritches> They prob didn't design the game based on how impressive they thought it would be 12 years in the future

[4:57:49] <velgaduere> @user_naim thank you, I didn't know who that joke was for, but I'm glad it was someone
[4:57:50] <%jiggy_snipe> we know
[4:57:50] <Johannen> 12 hours for a fast run
[4:57:52] <%Mrthefro> It's only long if you get caught up in Riddler shit.
[4:57:54] <%mundanelotus> good stuff
[4:57:55] <+skyheys> it's like 30 hours at most
[4:57:55] <%Wulfphelz> LUL
[4:57:57] <%Juriasu> what do we know?
[4:57:59] <+DizzyGunner> what do we know?
[4:57:59] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:58:02] <dukenux> not unless you go for completionist route
[4:58:11] <+TheTyper> That chair tho
[4:58:12] <Doctadaking> The combat and visuals are much improved in later games
[4:58:16] <user_naim> Dated, but still cool
[4:58:18] <super_harley_dude> gg's gents
[4:58:19] <Ashenik1> witcher game maybe? :3
[4:58:20] <%kullumanati> Did Reggie Edge up during the LP? SeemsGood
[4:58:22] <Johannen> I would say it would take around 14-15 hours for you guys
[4:58:28] <meganicmp3> the riddler things and etc really are the bulk of this game
[4:58:30] <%Halospaz117> Batman had weird fat lips
[4:58:31] <andre11dr> The art carries it
[4:58:32] <TheWizardOfWordplay> arkham knight makes this game look like mgs2
[4:58:51] <Ashenik1> Sekiro witth Reggie ? :3
[4:58:55] <+Iamdenril> arkham knight is a gorgeous game
[4:58:56] <THOTmerchant> @WoolieVersus Yeah it's not long. I have 20 hours in the game and have gotten all achievments.
[4:58:57] <Tracazoid> Arkham City has an opening where Bruce Wayne is reflected in Hugo Stange's glasses, in the remaster I think this is lost entirely
[4:58:59] <velgaduere> you wanna know how fucking exhausting the Riddler shit is? I was 3 trophies short of full completion before the end of the game and just said "fuck it" and ended it
[4:58:59] <%chosenjuan42> chosenjuan42 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Only on Woolie Vs can we see someone's first impressions of Paper Mario, Halo, Galaxy 2, & now Arkham Asylum.  Never change and keep up the great content!
[4:59:00] <%Asuterisuku> They made the mistake of zooming in.
[4:59:01] <%Halospaz117> @Ashenik1 w/ minh
[4:59:08] <meganicmp3> this game is all about atmosphere
[4:59:09] <+mechslayer71> Is Minh coming back for Sekiro?
[4:59:10] <Doctadaking> Arkham Knight has many problems, but the combat and predator gameplay were 10/10
[4:59:10] <Dante_Namikaze1> Nightwing is AC looks so bad they ruined him
[4:59:10] <%kyh9> Woolie, did you FEEL like Batman?
[4:59:11] <%Wulfphelz> Shhhh chat no spoilers
[4:59:12] <leomuratore> Arkham City looked great
[4:59:14] <+OUTheTeam> arkham knight is still one of the bedt looking games
[4:59:16] <DrkJP520> I mean, look at any other game from 2009
[4:59:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Arkham knight makes this game look like Citizen Kane
[4:59:23] <+DizzyGunner> looks good for a 12 Y/O game
[4:59:28] <Link_Hero_of_Legends> Just hopped in for lunch break, what we talking about?
[4:59:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> frankly, I am looking forward to Gotham Knights
[4:59:44] <+mechslayer71> @link_hero_of_legends remaster can original for this game
[4:59:45] <peachy996> The Remaster takes more away from City
[4:59:52] <%Asuterisuku> Thanks, Warner, fuck you, Warner.
[4:59:57] <$emptyantics> Akham Knight looks wet and great
[5:00:08] <leomuratore> peycey
[5:00:15] <peachy996> But City looks great anyway and a big model improvement from Asylum
[5:00:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> a PC that doesn't run Arkham Asylum. lol
[5:00:26] <dundore77> That apparently can't play a 2009 game with all the settings enabled
[5:00:26] <+condemned_15> Would you consider playing Arkham VR in the future?
[5:00:27] <%Asuterisuku> Knight didn't even need a remaster, it was same generation.
[5:00:30] <%chosenjuan42> But can my custom PC run Arkham Asylum at Max settings?
[5:00:35] <$eco419> SeemsGood
[5:00:36] <Doctadaking> I still maintain that City is better than Asylum, but just barely
[5:00:46] <leomuratore> City is great

[5:11:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't like the last Bioshock Infinite DLC
[5:11:34] <DatAsuna> What about the Republic Commando remaster? :P
[5:11:34] <TraitGene2> play clive barker's undying
[5:11:38] <%Wulfphelz> Just watch Batman The Brave and the Bold, that's the best batman to learn about ALL the DC characters LUL
[5:11:41] <+ClericOfSparda> omg
[5:11:44] <%kyh9> It does though
[5:11:44] <meganicmp3> play doom 3
[5:11:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @chatterbox1991 YOURE A HERETIC
[5:11:45] <Lancaster_H> yeaaaahhh
[5:11:45] <leomuratore> Another guy
[5:11:47] <notorious_rng> didnt infinite already ruin the franchise
[5:11:48] <%L3m0nTwi5t> Has Reggie ever played Chrono Trigger?
[5:11:48] <Ravioli_Ronin> Aw hell yeah republic commando
[5:11:48] <dabeaminator> Hasn't Systemshock aged kinda poorly? Or at least that's what I've been told.
[5:11:48] <%Deekman> burial at sea was great
[5:11:53] <Sunstalker> Ignore infinite, go check out minerva's den if you want
[5:11:53] <Gates623> Deus ex invisible war
[5:11:58] <Project205> that's too far, but I get it
[5:11:58] <JxsFusion> burial at sea is the best part of infinite
[5:11:59] <Prevot> it really does
[5:11:59] <%Chatterbox1991> Like, non-sensicle levels of retcon
[5:12:03] <ThatGuyThere03> bideo james
[5:12:04] <GarbageNirvana> I was kinda done with the franchise by the end of Infinite tbh
[5:12:04] <DatAsuna> Burial at Sea buries the franchise at sea
[5:12:07] <Johannen> There is REPUBLIC COMMANDO remake? WUT WHERE?
[5:12:08] <stukamod> Racism: DONE
[5:12:09] <fuji_92> burial is dope who was the one guy
[5:12:10] <andre11dr> System Shock is dope
[5:12:12] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus There is a pretty faithful remake of System Shock 1 coming in a couple months, so that's a thing
[5:12:16] <peachy996> @wendigo172 See what I mean? I meant Cluemaster but I care so little I said Spoiler bc that's more memorable
[5:12:17] <prime_name> Infintie has some good shit
[5:12:21] <theredfox930000> we need a wollie versus rap album here we come tougher than the rest of them the best of them
[5:12:24] <%Halospaz117> @Johannen re-release rather, on PS4 i believe
[5:12:24] <Ipsenscastle> Everything up to the combat in Infinite was fascinating
[5:12:25] <%kyh9> Burial At Sea REALLY fucks things up bad. Premise has never been enough to make a good piece of media.  Execution >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Premise
[5:12:26] <Ravioli_Ronin> Republic commando drops this month or next
[5:12:27] <huskarl_zap> People thinking levine can do more than some dialogue ruined the franchise.
[5:12:32] <dabeaminator> Infinite plays fine.
[5:12:33] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @xxsturben13xx (warning)
[5:12:35] <DatAsuna> @Johannen Coming next month to PS4 and switch, courtesy of Aspyr
[5:12:36] <syanplague> Sky Crimes
[5:12:37] <starlessdan> Columbia is just Zepp tho
[5:12:40] <%Asuterisuku> @Javaa01 Made by NightDive, the guys who have been remastering a whole bunch of Boomer Shooters lately.
[5:12:41] <GarbageNirvana> Infinite tries to say a whole lot without really saying anything
[5:12:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> nope, Burial at Sea is short, and then weird, but the second part of it is terrible
[5:12:54] <+RJay80> i enjoyed inifinite when i first played it
[5:12:55] <Lancaster_H> All it cost is just a minute now, for one dollar you can show me how...
[5:12:56] <%kyh9> Good execution of a bad premise trumps bad execution of a good premise
[5:12:58] <wendigo172> @peachy996 idk she has her fans. They threw a fit once New 52 happened. Protesting at cons etc
[5:13:04] <Ravioli_Ronin> I love the trailers we got for Infinite. The Acadian game? 🤷♂️
[5:13:14] <rytisone> I dont like endings that require youtube video explanation what happened
[5:13:15] <huskarl_zap> America bad
[5:13:26] <cheap_turbo> dishonored is like that
[5:13:27] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, play what you want to play.
[5:13:28] <andre11dr> Infinite had a lot of cool ideas, but big problems that came packaged with those
[5:13:28] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus  Colombia as a setting is more interesting than the game
[5:13:32] <%blazingmist> blazingmist subscribed with Prime. 
[5:13:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like Bioshock Infinite base game a lot
[5:13:36] <DatAsuna> Remember when actual republicans uironically were reposting the propaganda art from infinite going on about how cool it was?
[5:13:36] <meganicmp3> fallout or whatever
[5:13:40] <%kyh9> GOOD, STAY AWAY REGGIE
[5:13:41] <theredfox930000> it would have been a good movie
[5:13:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DatAsuna oh shit Aspyr still exists? They were/possibly are The Mac Port Guys
[5:13:44] <starlessdan> I wish Infinite was the game the devs wanted to make, not the game Ken Levine wanted to make
[5:13:50] <GarbageNirvana> Infinite's politics are infuriatingly centrist
[5:13:55] <jorniev> feels bad cause i liked infinite
[5:13:59] <%guyalex> BIG PROBLEMS
[5:14:03] <huskarl_zap> NOW that is a top kek
[5:14:03] <Johannen> Infinite droped the ball like it has never been droped before
[5:14:04] <leomuratore> @garbagenirvana True.
[5:14:08] <wendigo172> Has Woolie played Dishonored before?
[5:14:10] <PanicSwytch> Plot
[5:14:13] <DatAsuna> @LiquidDinosaur Well they also did great ports of jedi outcast/academy and kotor 1/2 to android/switch/ps4
[5:14:13] <$emptyantics> Ken Levine is a mediocre writer
[5:14:14] <fuji_92> infinite is fine, not great, not awesome, it's fine
[5:14:18] <prime_name> Story and themes are really not great
[5:14:18] <horriblegoatdemon> Ken Levine says "Both sides are bad"
[5:14:18] <Lancaster_H> setting is sick, gameplay is downgraded, story is a mess
[5:14:18] <mortificent> Infinite's both sides bullshit is SO BVAD
[5:14:19] <starlessdan> Dishonored is amazing
[5:14:20] <%paladinstarbuster> people dont like it? I thought it was just the ending
[5:14:24] <dabeaminator> It's mostly the writing, honestly. The gameplay is fine.
[5:14:30] <%kyh9> Infinite's story and gameplay are FUCKED.  The world design is cool but not very immersive
[5:14:30] <Doctadaking> Surface level commentary
[5:14:31] <+nomad390> I LOVED Infinite, the remaster is pretty good
[5:14:32] <%Chatterbox1991> Most people like it a lot, sci fi nerds hate cus it's really sot science
[5:14:34] <Prevot> I don't think MOST people hate it, a lot of people eat that shit right up
[5:14:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like the ending ending
[5:14:41] <leomuratore> Ken Levine, the centrist.
[5:14:43] <+PrettyGirlWithaLazyEye> hey chat is the first batman stream? been studying lots so havent tuned in recently
[5:14:44] <tattleworm> "we gotta keep the non-whites down or they'll start eating children" and then they actually do
[5:14:48] <Johannen> Gameplay is not fine, its a basic run and gun shooter without any cool ideas
[5:14:49] <%Irridium> Gameplay was honestly the weakest of the franchise I felt. could just do so much more cool stuff in Bioshock 1 and 2
[5:14:49] <%guyalex> surface? the twist is black people killing children haha
[5:14:51] <meganicmp3> i traded my copy of bioshock on ps3 and i regret it
[5:14:52] <Ravioli_Ronin> Remember when ken Levine said he was going to take a few bioshock devs and start making games, and that was like 5 years ago and nothing happened?
[5:14:56] <Jaysky> SMOTHER.
[5:14:57] <%jinking79> Would you kindly
[5:14:58] <Asuterisuku> Infinite is worth playing.
[5:14:58] <andre11dr> I would say play it ,it's fine
[5:15:07] <PanicSwytch> Its great but the plot is overwhelming
[5:15:09] <%kyh9> "OH MAN, I REALLY LOVE ONLY CARRYING TWO GUNS BUT ALSO HAVING TO UPGRADE INDIVIDUAL GUN TYPES THAT I WONT ALWAYS HAVE AMMO FOR"
[5:15:13] <dmtjinni> LUL
[5:15:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[5:15:34] <meganicmp3> virgin nigma vs chad woolie
[5:15:39] <%jiggy_snipe> no he's annoying but I like that he's annoying like that
[5:15:39] <+eanscrale> Isn't he the main villain in one of these?
[5:15:40] <+PrettyGirlWithaLazyEye> @BlackermanZX thanks
[5:15:46] <rytisone> Riddler being annoying is what he does
[5:15:46] <dabeaminator> Riddler gets really bad in City.
[5:15:52] <syanplague> I mean you have a LP to make, so for sure is not priority
[5:15:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Riddler is MOST annoying in Knight
[5:15:57] <mrslappyboi2020> definitely worth doing a few for the sake of xp though
[5:16:04] <%krispen_wa> Its the LAMEST reward
[5:16:06] <velgaduere> yeah that's fine, it really isn't worth it
[5:16:06] <+loukemia83> Riddler is ONE GUY in chat personified
[5:16:11] <%kyh9> LOVE the variety here, legitimately great
[5:16:14] <%Asuterisuku> Never fear the algorithm Woolie.
[5:16:14] <mortificent> Riddler is only worth in Knight
[5:16:16] <+NocturnePsycho> imagine collecting that shit through an entire city though
[5:16:18] <Tracazoid> LUL
[5:16:20] <%Irridium> LUL
[5:16:21] <%BeeComfy> woolieFUN woolieFUN

[5:16:37] <BaslerJones> YEYEYEYEYE
[5:16:37] <ExpressNode> Thats kind of like me
[5:16:39] <+nabs2099> THATS WHY ITS FUN WOOLIE
[5:16:43] <+Hick12> I liked Riddler in City and Origins the most.
[5:16:44] <%Asuterisuku> So about tomorrow's stream!
[5:16:50] <majindusto> WOOLIE'S LATE TO THE PARTY LPs
[5:16:51] <andre11dr> Now time to bring some Dead Space and RE into the fold and were in
[5:16:53] <syanplague> eating a AAA hamburger every now and them
[5:16:57] <DatAsuna> When's WooliveVS Cities SKylines?
[5:17:03] <fuji_92> only fighting games in this household
[5:17:03] <SomersaultJustice> FITE GAEMZ
[5:17:03] <%CptnCampy61> LATE to EVERY party
[5:17:05] <Ravioli_Ronin> I miss dead space so much :(
[5:17:08] <$emptyantics> The Riddler reward in AK is kinda neat
[5:17:09] <BlackermanZX> Reggie plays Dead Space would be GOOD
[5:17:10] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie likes fighting games and character action
[5:17:15] <starlessdan> I cant wait for the disco full cut LP
[5:17:23] <meganicmp3> thats where the meat is
[5:17:27] <jorniev> HALO WAS FUN
[5:17:27] <%Deekman> dude Dead Space would be a sick playthrough
[5:17:28] <+samuraiknack> When Woolie vs FIFA?
[5:17:33] <SomersaultJustice> watch woolie play like FF4 or something
[5:17:37] <+Posh_Cat> Halo was a great ride
[5:17:37] <DatAsuna> WoolieVS Madden
[5:17:42] <+Hick12> Woolie VS Dota Anime
[5:17:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> Dead space and republic commando when
[5:17:43] <leomuratore> @samuraiknack This would be incredible. LUL
[5:17:49] <redrins> no but play my game though Kappa
[5:17:50] <dabeaminator> @starlessdan Doesn't Disco Elysium come out this month?
[5:17:51] <+NocturnePsycho> i still go back and rewatch the halo LPs
[5:17:51] <%chosenjuan42> We love that you do it!  It's so rare since most people have done them before
[5:17:52] <%ZweihanderSteve> lmao
[5:18:01] <meganicmp3> republic commando would be nice
[5:18:03] <fuji_92> WoolieVS Dragon's Dogma
[5:18:04] <+nabs2099> lol I gave up on most anime in 2015 tbh
[5:18:09] <DatAsuna> You can, but it's boring
[5:18:10] <starlessdan> @dabeaminator Maybe. It's Estonian artists for devs so who can say
[5:18:12] <andre11dr> Dude i forgot, Woolie never played FF6 LUL
[5:18:15] <ExpressNode> I stopped being a seasonal anime guy. Since there is so much anime out there you can take your time
[5:18:18] <prime_name> Woolie VS Grafiti Kingdom
[5:18:20] <%jiggy_snipe> there will never be a enough time for everything, so consume what you really like
[5:18:25] <%ZweihanderSteve> its so hard to keep up with stuff that you might not like
[5:18:32] <$emptyantics> Woolie Vs. DRAGONS DOGMA WHEN?!
[5:18:36] <+nabs2099> WOOLIE Vs Dragon's Dogma would be amazing
[5:18:59] <BlackermanZX> Man graffiti kingdom was so fun LUL
[5:19:00] <+waltzqueen> BibleThump
[5:19:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie vs MORE GOEMON, WHENZ
[5:19:07] <+nabs2099> BUT RE2 LP WAS SO GOOD THO

[5:19:09] <%Asuterisuku> And that is fine.
[5:19:10] <%L3m0nTwi5t> How about Reggie woolieVS Chrono Trigger woolieGASM
[5:19:12] <andre11dr> I like them
[5:19:13] <Ipsenscastle> I also vote for Woolie VS Dragons Dogma
[5:19:17] <fuji_92> Claire B never
[5:19:17] <majindusto> CLAIRE B NEVER BibleThump
[5:19:21] <%CptnCampy61> Not for me
[5:19:22] <TraitGene2> we need to find woolie a character action survival horror game
[5:19:22] <Tracazoid> Woolie's favourite RE is Umbrella Chronicles Kappa
[5:19:23] <starlessdan> Real talk, you taught me how to appreciate fighting games and character action games
[5:19:24] <Allen_33> I like your content for playing stuff I never actually play
[5:19:25] <Arkfyre> Woolie vs Metroid Prime
[5:19:25] <+samuraiknack> Woolie vs Rule of Rose
[5:19:25] <Johannen> Fighting games are too much of a niche that requires a lot of time, so its super niche
[5:19:26] <Lancaster_H> ADA WONG THO
[5:19:29] <DatAsuna> WoolieVS Silent Hill Shattered Memories colouring minigame
[5:19:29] <+SolidusRex> WHEN'S CLAIRE B?
[5:19:35] <huskarl_zap> Huge FAns = You better go pick up that brick.
[5:19:46] <%ValentineWolf7> A person with other tastes that aren't mine?!! *GASP*
[5:19:46] <%mundanelotus> RE Remake playthrough confirmed??? lets go
[5:19:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie vs Mystical Ninja 64, Top 5 games for N64
[5:20:10] <andre11dr> RE 7 would be a sick LP
[5:20:14] <ExpressNode> Woolie vs Goemon's Great Adventure
[5:20:14] <BlackermanZX> Reggie vs SH2/SH3
[5:20:24] <%krispen_wa> Woolie likes Fighting Games? WHAAA?
[5:20:27] <+taren817> !uptime
[5:20:27] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 20 minutes
[5:20:34] <CoffeeSlice> ReggieVS RE7
[5:20:36] <meganicmp3> woolie vs SiN
[5:20:41] <DatAsuna> I would still like to see Woolie try a Tales game like abyss or vesperia, but they're the most anti-LP games with shittons of missable sidequests
[5:20:43] <Tracazoid> I only started Yakuza in 2019, that was some good shit.
[5:20:45] <%Wulfphelz> I expect you to go through these old games and be a master at them like chat totally was when we went through Kappa
[5:20:46] <%BinaryFireball> man I hate halflife
[5:20:47] <kamenspidey> woolievs getting into survival horror
[5:20:55] <%chosenjuan42> GREAT CONTENT
[5:20:57] <+nabs2099> I want some Minh Vs
[5:21:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Mystical Ninja 64 would legit be easy and enjoyable, vs Goemon's Great Adventure would be EVEN MORE frustrating than Legend of the Mystical Ninja
[5:21:04] <andre11dr> I don't think Woolie would like Silent Hill
[5:21:05] <alfredfromthedusk> I wanna see Woolie do a full run of Metal Gear with someone who didn't play it
[5:21:12] <%ZweihanderSteve> yuhyuhyuh halo is alright woolieMIRIN

[5:21:58] <meganicmp3> aaron cash
[5:22:01] <TraitGene2> and then he did it 3 more times
[5:22:03] <Doctadaking> He said that after every game I think
[5:22:04] <leomuratore> It wasn't, was it?
[5:22:04] <SheefEatsBeef> Thugz Munny
[5:22:08] <dabeaminator> Boy that didn't happen
[5:22:10] <%Asuterisuku> He said that and then went to do the rest of the Trilogy.
[5:22:11] <+NocturnePsycho> it isnt tho lmao
[5:22:12] <HollowMan190> he kert going
[5:22:12] <prime_name> Then he came back
[5:22:12] <wibbwobbler> LUL
[5:22:12] <Wild_Samurai> dude Mark says that EVERY project
[5:22:12] <peachy996> And then he kept coming back
[5:22:13] <fuji_92> he said but he kept doing it
[5:22:13] <mighty_fine_trousers> Thought it was City due to reasons?
[5:22:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:22:14] <%jiggy_snipe> and then he lied?
[5:22:14] <+puma_sama> don't forget that this game makes you FEEL like Batman
[5:22:14] <rytisone> not for Origins
[5:22:16] <Dante_Namikaze1> No it was Arkham City
[5:22:19] <%krispen_wa> [TELL ME LIES]
[5:22:20] <+GenesisKnight> That was a lie LUL
[5:22:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but then MONEY
[5:22:24] <NoireRequiem> We brought him back in
[5:22:25] <PanicSwytch> He said it every time but money talks
[5:22:26] <andre11dr> And he did it for Injustice too
[5:22:26] <+samuraiknack> He says that everytime
[5:22:27] <kamenspidey> aren't the sequels troy baker?
[5:22:30] <+loukemia83> mans gotta eat
[5:22:30] <bear_breaker20> mark loves the role too much
[5:22:34] <YVESSAINTMORON_> Tell me sweet little lies
[5:22:34] <joshua_42> THAT WAS A FUCKING LIE
[5:22:35] <meganicmp3> troy baker is origins
[5:22:39] <leomuratore> @kamenspidey Arkham Origins
[5:22:41] <%Asuterisuku> Troy Baker did him in Origins.
[5:22:41] <heartlesshealer> I love that the world acknowledges him as Best Joker
[5:22:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> “I’m not gonna do my money maker voice”
[5:22:44] <Lancaster_H> hes having too much fun in that studio to drop it
[5:22:47] <peachy996> Origins is Troy Baker, Injustice is Raiden's VA
[5:22:52] <dabeaminator> @kamenspidey He may have only done Arkham Origins
[5:22:56] <%Halospaz117> He kills it, much like the citizens of Gotham
[5:22:59] <+TunakIn> all of them except origins with troy baker
[5:23:01] <%Seancicle> gonna bounce. cul8tr
[5:23:02] <+Posh_Cat> Troy baker did a pretty imitation
[5:23:02] <NoireRequiem> anyone see him as the trickster on cw?
[5:23:04] <TheCrispyBoi> jack
[5:23:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Who is joker in MK?
[5:23:08] <majindusto> LETO
[5:23:08] <meganicmp3> jared leto is underrated!
[5:23:09] <velgaduere> DISCOOOOOORD
[5:23:12] <%Chatterbox1991> Ceasar Romero is still super good
[5:23:16] <+nabs2099> Reggie Vs Pokemon Shining Diamond Nuzlocke when
[5:23:17] <+evbites> i hate baker as joker
[5:23:17] <jowi_time> if the arkham games were his last time as joker, im good with that. They are a great send off
