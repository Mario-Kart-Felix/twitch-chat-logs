[0:19:29] <@Menitta> yeah he now has EVERY move he had in DMC5. Most are now command normals
[0:20:13] <@Menitta> As someone who put 100+ hours as Vergil in DMC5SE, hes right at home for me woolieGASM
[0:20:28] <andre11dr> Now each weapon has its own moveset
[0:20:31] <@Menitta> Aerial Lunar Phase

[0:25:06] <andre11dr> Man i need to finish the Everhood streams cause this frog shit is flying right over my head
[0:25:06] <+Jiggisnipe> maybe Artorias

[0:25:27] <%baka_sugoi> UwU
[0:25:29] <TheFlexibleWolllPlus> *so are we suppose to guess?*

[0:25:37] <%livlinn> butt emote in woolieversus?? woolieMIRIN
[0:25:41] <kadjah> Frog lore

[0:25:49] <skyshinecrusader> What happened with frogs
[0:25:58] <+CompassArisen> Bulborb psx PogChamp
[0:26:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus can't find the secret myself, but devs says there's a "secret area teleport gravestone"
[0:26:15] <%Nested_Dreams> was it DS2 or an Everhood stream moment?
[0:26:21] <jackedup92> those scanlines
[0:26:28] <Treasure_Vault> Remastest this bad boy
[0:26:31] <%espanishcanamurciana> The music ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
[0:26:35] <foghornleghorn55> who's playing?
[0:26:37] <andre11dr> Can i say, i love how Woolie kept up the Snailborne tradition by being the only one to not finish this in one sitting LUL
[0:26:45] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:26:55] <RyuuAoi> Woolie on the sticks

[0:26:58] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> KomodoHype
[0:27:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> So glad Sony shut down Japan studio but spent all that money on Bungie. Kappa
[0:27:08] <+patriotrenegade> Sony why do you spite us
[0:27:10] <%hax_metatron> Everyday without news of a Bloodborne remake gives me joy. Just put 60fps on it that's enough.
[0:27:13] <%Noonoox12> Noonoox12 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Yoooooooo more BBPSX! I beat Johnny Gascap last night and I'm excited to see you beat 'em too! Elden Ring.... ooOOooOooh Elden Ring!!
[0:27:14] <%Xaeveax> @andre11dr It wouldn't be the same otherwise
[0:27:19] <%jinking79> man that Silent Hill video title on point
[0:27:22] <@Menitta> I have faith
[0:27:24] <BlackermanZX> saw claver is solid anyways
[0:27:50] <RyuuAoi> The nostalgia with this one through. BB was admittedly my first "Souls" game.
[0:28:07] <+TopTieramisu> @RyuuAoi starting on a high point, i see
[0:28:10] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus you can farm for upgrade mats its fine, just need 7 insight
[0:28:15] <@Solidus_113> kirkhammer is confirmed not in
[0:28:23] <RyuuAoi> @toptieramisu A beating for sure!
[0:28:40] <oda_flobunaga> Continuing from John Dark Souls  and John Bloodbourne, can we go with Elden Jon?
[0:29:20] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> John Ring, star of the hit new souls game.. ehh

[0:36:55] <otakon17> BAD BORKERS
[0:36:57] <+patriotrenegade> SNUFF THEM
[0:36:59] <%Feralspirit41> @cappuccinoguil i know whats behind it if thats what youre asking
[0:37:00] <+robertoszek> FOUL BEAST
[0:37:00] <Crownaux0> pup snuff
[0:37:01] <otakon17> no
[0:37:02] <+TopTieramisu> dogs are evil in miyazaki game
[0:37:05] <otakon17> you can't cure Rabies
[0:37:06] <UrsaDoom> the cure is a sawblade
[0:37:08] <velgaduere> euthanization, one might say
[0:37:10] <+TopTieramisu> games*
[0:37:14] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:37:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Bork Breakas
[0:37:16] <%Feralspirit41> I mean its a kind of saving
[0:37:20] <otakon17> you ABSOLUTELY have to put a rabid pupper down
[0:37:21] <nutimik> rabies is 100% lethal
[0:37:21] <CappuccinoGuil> @Feralspirit41 I just need to know if that's the place the dev calls "secret area" is all
[0:37:22] <%Xaeveax> But can you pet the dogs? woolieFROG
[0:37:23] <DrkJP520> rabies is incurable
[0:37:26] <RyuuAoi> Pup Snuffers
[0:37:27] <+patriotrenegade> yes
[0:37:27] <otakon17> it's 100% lethal
[0:37:30] <+froduck42> it causes brain damage so no
[0:37:32] <+robertoszek> rabies is 100% lethal
[0:37:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> Did they have any say in getting killed Woolie?
[0:37:33] <otakon17> snuff the pupp
[0:37:35] <UrsaDoom> actually, Yarnham dogs doesn't have rabies. They're trained to be xenophobic.
[0:37:36] <oda_flobunaga> Rabies can be cured with a long range lead injection to the cranium
[0:37:40] <+robertoszek> on humans too
[0:37:42] <%Feralspirit41> @cappuccinoguil i dont think so
[0:37:45] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no you gotta break that borker
[0:37:46] <%livlinn> rabies is real life zombie disease
[0:37:53] <andre11dr> veteran arien?
[0:37:57] <BudderZilla> A hoonter moost hoont
[0:38:01] <otakon17> @oda_flobunaga I mean, that amount of lead applied directly to the skull will "cure" most things
[0:38:04] <%Feralspirit41> Borks have been busted
[0:38:04] <samuraijakanddaxter> i don't believe there is a cure for rabies still
[0:38:12] <DrkJP520> You could be saved from rabies, but only before symptoms show up
[0:38:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Let me tell you about a old film classic "Old Yeller"
[0:38:14] <%LastHazzerd> snuff that pup
[0:38:17] <otakon17> Dead in a single strike, you put him out of his misery
[0:38:22] <+tigerstyle96> Im surprised this game didnt get shut down
[0:38:24] <CappuccinoGuil> @Feralspirit41 hmmmm then I'm not quite sure what she means by "secret area teleport gravestone"
[0:38:27] <%Feralspirit41> She dead af

[0:38:47] <andre11dr> Rip old lady
[0:38:48] <+patriotrenegade> LET GO OF PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
[0:38:51] <%livlinn> dothmyCrycat
[0:38:54] <%Feralspirit41> @cappuccinoguil i imagine theres a gravestone somewhere that can port you. Tbf last time i looked was last patch
[0:38:55] <RyuuAoi> Reload your save, Woolie.
[0:39:00] <%Explodincatz> time to restart the game
[0:39:05] <%LastHazzerd> forget what you know
[0:39:08] <nutimik> bad end
[0:39:10] <RyuuAoi> LP over.
[0:39:12] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> rest in power
[0:39:14] <%kyh9> Are they watching the Direct?  Did they say?
[0:39:15] <andre11dr> She was a huge bitch anyway so meh
[0:39:17] <%dds333a> Oh well
[0:39:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> gotta factory reset your pc too
[0:39:21] <%Feralspirit41> Idk what the trigger is for her
[0:39:29] <%Xaeveax> You'll meet again, at another time, in another Dream
[0:39:33] <RyuuAoi> Welp...
[0:39:36] <velgaduere> the remake
[0:39:39] <Treasure_Vault> Differs from the books
[0:39:40] <Crownaux0> @kyh9 "We'll see"
[0:39:42] <+TopTieramisu> the original light novel
[0:39:43] <UrsaDoom> the perils of adaptation
[0:39:43] <nutimik> does Woolie know he can turn off loading times?
[0:39:54] <%G_Thunders> He knows
[0:39:58] <nutimik> gotcha
[0:40:04] <DrkJP520> I don't know if you knew, but the ps4 remake to this game is amazing
[0:40:06] <T_Sasquatch> shouldnt eileen be here
[0:40:10] <velgaduere> he also knows he can play in "remastered"
[0:40:13] <otakon17> Sewer Count: innumerable
[0:40:15] <RyuuAoi> You can't turn off load time on psx
[0:40:17] <velgaduere> but this is about the PSX experience
[0:40:19] <%Feralspirit41> @t_sasquatch shhhhhhh
[0:40:25] <Treasure_Vault> Turning off the loading times for the second stream seems good though
[0:40:26] <otakon17> this is a one way trip...
[0:40:27] <nutimik> why would you play remastered though, that's missing the point
[0:40:32] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> though the ps4 remake never fixed the loads this original has
[0:40:33] <%dds333a> @drkjp520 took them awhile too, well worth the wait.
[0:40:36] <UrsaDoom> I would like a Kings Field Bloodborne
[0:40:43] <CappuccinoGuil> @Feralspirit41 can you DM me what's behind the 7 insight door?
[0:40:44] <velgaduere> @Treasure_Vault maybe, but again, it's about the experience he wants
[0:40:48] <otakon17> man I hate heights in games with fall damage
[0:40:58] <otakon17> I always get so nervous doing stuff like this
[0:41:03] <T_Sasquatch> @Feralspirit41 he played the og game, im not trying to hint anything
[0:41:07] <jagwabs> people make noises
[0:41:09] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:41:10] <otakon17> try transforming it?
[0:41:14] <jagwabs> when theyre sick
[0:41:15] <T_Sasquatch> i dont know shit about this demake
[0:41:16] <otakon17> doesn't the cleaver have more range?
[0:41:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> dunno if he has transform yet
[0:41:48] <%dds333a> 'ello
[0:41:49] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> he does
[0:41:52] <%Feralspirit41> Looking dapper as fuck

[1:06:58] <%Feralspirit41> Maybe its just a bug
[1:07:01] <leith_aziz> I mainly use a PC, but I dont really play fan-made games. "FUN" is probably the website that made me fatigued as a kid pickyFocus
[1:07:03] <DrkJP520> I think this was the same area the echoes disappeared on me too
[1:07:07] <%Feralspirit41> or the stain fell through the world again
[1:07:12] <Ziegsy> is twitch buffering for anyone else?
[1:07:16] <Forkeye> :c
[1:07:21] <AppleBerryKitty> also the beast eyes wasnt glowing
[1:07:22] <%dds333a> Welp LUL
[1:07:24] <leith_aziz> @Ziegsy As in, lagging?
[1:07:30] <+robertoszek> you bloodstain jumped on the ladder
[1:07:35] <+robertoszek> your*
[1:07:45] <Ziegsy> stopping for a few secons with the spinny wheel
[1:08:10] <%dds333a> "Bad idea, Good idea"
[1:08:18] <andre11dr> @ziegsy Seems fine for me ,maybe it's your internet
[1:08:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> ah the classic 5 inch plunge attack
[1:08:32] <%Feralspirit41> there be the spear
[1:08:33] <andre11dr> Try refreshing Twitch
[1:08:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> that sounds different now that I read what I typed
[1:08:42] <+patriotrenegade> they vibing
[1:08:45] <Ziegsy> will do, tyty
[1:08:55] <%Feralspirit41> that molotov was just a vibe check
[1:08:55] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> yeah, 5‚Äù plunge is.. hm
[1:09:02] <BlackermanZX> what the rat doin
[1:09:10] <%bruuzer12> new weapon, technically
[1:09:12] <%dds333a> Edge
[1:09:16] <%Indigo_Automaton> Saw Spear?
[1:09:17] <%Feralspirit41> but not really
[1:09:48] <VincentGraves> the better weapon
[1:09:49] <%dds333a> A Bloodrinker Saw Spear
[1:09:51] <%bruuzer12> it's the saw spear, but rehashed to work with bloodtinge
[1:09:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> it has ketchup on it though
[1:10:05] <%Feralspirit41> slightly different trick move set to
[1:10:12] <%dds333a> Ya
[1:10:15] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> the cleaver is back, in pog form
[1:10:16] <%Feralspirit41> the spear goes side to side cleaver goes up and down
[1:10:55] <%bruuzer12> and it scales with bloodtinge now, so that's cool
[1:11:21] <%Feralspirit41> but why would you invest in bloodtinge naturally unless you wanna go that way
[1:11:29] <andre11dr> It's supposed to be an upgrade to the cleaver but in the the end the Saw Cleaver is still more op
[1:11:30] <%Feralspirit41> specifically i meN
[1:11:33] <%Feralspirit41> mean*
[1:11:41] <+vaderxyz1970> @andre11dr Gun Jesus run

[1:13:02] <+aWanderingKaivo> birdin up
[1:13:08] <+patriotrenegade> some birds have teeth
[1:13:10] <%Feralspirit41> bird gang
[1:13:15] <MadBaller123> Did they encounter father Guacamole yet?
[1:13:20] <Ziegsy> geese have teeth on their tongue
[1:13:22] <%Feralspirit41> nope
[1:13:32] <%dds333a> @feralspirit41 some games only had sound, and that was it LUL
[1:13:40] <+Jiggisnipe> woolieFROG
[1:13:48] <TheProtomanBlues> Have they pet the dog?
[1:13:50] <%Feralspirit41> @dds333a and those are the ones we always remember
[1:13:56] <+patriotrenegade> Geese have teeth
[1:14:05] <%Feralspirit41> Geese are assholes
[1:14:12] <+saltpiggu> square to walk
[1:14:15] <%Feralspirit41> i got chased by a flock of them once
[1:14:24] <+mechslayer71> so, we gonna Skip ds2 for actual bloodborne, right?
[1:14:29] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:14:48] <+anoldtoilet> i dont like ds2 but i would like to see them play it
[1:14:51] <CappuccinoGuil> @mechslayer71 seems like we're doing DS2 first, Woolie is playing it for research
[1:14:52] <%dds333a> As we all know, Geese and Swans are terrors of the natural world
[1:14:55] <+patriotrenegade> knew it
[1:15:00] <+anoldtoilet> it might be easier if reggarth sticks w the ol sorcery, i hear its mad strong in 2
[1:15:01] <MadBaller123> just like the original
[1:15:04] <%Feralspirit41> the true apex predators
[1:15:05] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> too many of us like 2 to let it slide by
[1:15:15] <MadBaller123> You can't skip out on 2
[1:15:16] <bigshedman> One day, we will rid the world of all geese, and we will finally know peace.
[1:15:20] <%hax_metatron> Because you didn't put points in skill Woolie LUL
[1:15:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @„Çª„Éì„Éº rise up DS2 gang
[1:15:28] <%hax_metatron> Throwing knives scale with skil
[1:15:29] <+mechslayer71> oh I know they're gonna do ds2. was mostly a joke. it's just I recently experienced it again and boy was it not worth the time
[1:15:30] <%Feralspirit41> Dont eat turkey eat geese
[1:15:33] <+anoldtoilet> its part of the series you gotta do it. it has cool stuff in it
[1:15:34] <%dds333a> LUL LUL
[1:15:42] <Sonicdy> Geese like preditions Kappa
[1:15:53] <%Feralspirit41> Why do these rats make bubble popping sounds
[1:15:56] <velgaduere> @mechslayer71 Woolie's said it's up to Reggie, so I'm hoping he's inspired by this to do this next
[1:16:01] <%Xaeveax> DS2 is fantastic. (Minus a few questionable choices)
[1:16:08] <+vaderxyz1970> Has Woolie found some pork yet?
[1:16:14] <%Feralspirit41> not yet
[1:16:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice call
[1:16:27] <%Feralspirit41> HAT that i missed
[1:16:37] <+mechslayer71> @xaeveax like almost every boss?
[1:16:53] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> DS2 is the last of what i consider ‚Äòclassic‚Äô souls.. 3 is closer to bb in terms of flow
[1:16:55] <%dds333a> the R.E.G System at work, once again
[1:16:56] <%hax_metatron> ZULLIE TRIBUTE
[1:17:00] <+vaderxyz1970> DS2 is great exept for DS2
[1:17:02] <%hax_metatron> ZULLIE the MODDER
[1:17:03] <$thotbane> Zulie
[1:17:06] <%Xaeveax> @mechslayer71 A few of them. I do like most of them though.
[1:17:07] <+patriotrenegade> ZULLIE
[1:17:07] <+crot454> hat
[1:17:12] <velgaduere> luv Zullie
[1:17:13] <+Ryaotz> The dev?
[1:17:15] <%bruuzer12> Hey, that's a cool reference
[1:17:23] <%LastHazzerd> it does kinda work
[1:17:28] <MadBaller123> I remember going through Shrine of Amana and feeling exhausted
[1:17:29] <CappuccinoGuil> I think it's a reference to the Dev
[1:17:34] <+mechslayer71> nah those bosses are ass
[1:17:37] <andre11dr> That looks really stupid LUL
[1:17:40] <oda_flobunaga> Makes you wonder if there is any unused/hidden stuff in this
[1:17:41] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[1:17:45] <foghornleghorn55> ds2 reference
[1:17:46] <%Feralspirit41> Woolie shot reggie down
[1:17:47] <%bruuzer12> zullie and the dev, two for one
[1:17:48] <%dds333a> Not Zullie the character, just the person LUL
[1:17:53] <%Xaeveax> You're not allowed to go see this cool stuff. woolieEVIL
[1:17:55] <%townzzzzz> watch it behind his back
[1:17:59] <FrostedZaibatsu> I just saw the Tombs of the Giant lit up. Amazing video
[1:18:05] <%LastHazzerd> when you're older, reggie
[1:18:08] <CappuccinoGuil> Honestly, it's kinda working
[1:18:11] <%Feralspirit41> Theres this place with cool stuff. But you cant go there
[1:18:23] <%hax_metatron> Zullie has Demon's Souls and DS1 playlists if Reggarth wants to check them out
[1:18:43] <+vaderxyz1970> Too dangerous for cherry boi Reggie
[1:18:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:45] <MadBaller123> that water texture is great
[1:18:48] <+patriotrenegade> @hax_metatron Yeah but the ads he'll get for other videos might have spoilers
[1:18:53] <%hax_metatron> Eh, YOLO
[1:18:59] <%Feralspirit41> The water texture is slow and gross and I love it
[1:19:03] <Louie_Salmon> Video titles and thumbnails are still iffy though
[1:19:16] <+anoldtoilet> FIREBOMB?
[1:19:19] <%LastHazzerd> EFFICIENT
[1:19:21] <%dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[1:19:21] <+anoldtoilet> OH ARE FIREBOMBS GOOD?
[1:19:21] <%espanishcanamurciana> Look at that water texture
[1:19:22] <andre11dr> The problem is that Zulie has multiple videos that have future bosses in the thumbnail
[1:19:23] <+anoldtoilet> LUL
[1:19:23] <%Feralspirit41> get GOT
[1:19:24] <%Charronia> gdqGdqExplode limesYay
[1:19:26] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:19:37] <%Feralspirit41> No knives for you though
[1:19:40] <%espanishcanamurciana> It‚Äôs like the coruscant sewers from shadow of the empire
[1:19:47] <%LastHazzerd> LUL
[1:19:51] <GHouseduivel> Blekcsolance
[1:19:53] <+robertoszek> Reggie lovin' the molotovs, I wonder why
[1:20:01] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> ugh, SotE sewers!
[1:20:12] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> thats a memory i didnt need
[1:20:19] <%dds333a> @espanishcanamurciana you just reminded me of the death scream from falling in that game LUL
[1:20:31] <%Feralspirit41> I love the drip sound effect that was in every sewer level in psx games
[1:20:37] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[1:20:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> rats can't swim but they have mad hops
[1:20:44] <%Feralspirit41> You can hear it
[1:20:56] <+vaderxyz1970> Just want to give the gift that keeps on giving
[1:20:57] <+anoldtoilet> its cool
[1:21:01] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> YUR MAH QUEEN
[1:21:03] <Forkeye> boots constantly wet with sewage
[1:21:07] <+anoldtoilet> this is my first time tuning in to this game but im impressed at how psx it is
[1:21:10] <MadBaller123> literal drip
[1:21:18] <+robertoszek> grant us eyes
[1:21:19] <Cyan_Dream> Go into the water. Live there, die there.
[1:21:19] <%Indigo_Automaton> Ah dunt wunt it, Ah nevah have
[1:21:20] <%Feralspirit41> Constant
[1:21:27] <+anoldtoilet> it even has z fighting and the vertex thijng w/e its called
[1:21:27] <oda_flobunaga> Does it at least run at 240p?
[1:21:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> LUL
[1:21:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Bodied
[1:21:50] <Cyan_Dream> It died because it couldn't swim, confirmed!
[1:21:51] <Louie_Salmon> @anoldtoilet It also artificially lags when complex effects are on-screen
[1:21:51] <velgaduere> SWAMP LEVEL?
[1:21:51] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> proof!
[1:21:58] <+sixcubit> wait. did the dev ADD a poison swamp to bloodborne
[1:21:59] <+anoldtoilet> @Louie_Salmon lol thats so sick
[1:22:01] <%Feralspirit41> I love how reggie instantly knew that purple was poison
[1:22:10] <+aWanderingKaivo> nah its just grape juice
[1:22:12] <foghornleghorn55> it's not dead it just swam away
[1:22:17] <+patriotrenegade> DS2's best boss is the Ivory King for the spectacle alone, but Sinh is definitely the best boss to actually  fight
[1:22:17] <%Feralspirit41> Ok so
[1:22:20] <%Feralspirit41> hm
[1:22:30] <%Indigo_Automaton> Realistically ALL of this water should be poison
[1:22:33] <andre11dr> Even in the games Miyazaki didn't make, poison will always be there
[1:22:38] <Cyan_Dream> That new shortcut from earlier!
[1:22:39] <nutimik> sinh fucking sucks, that fight is 90% running after him because he's flying away

[1:23:00] <nutimik> kalameet is the only good dragon boss from soft has made
[1:23:13] <+mechslayer71> @andre11dr the C Team knew they had to fulfill his one wish
[1:23:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> @nutimik Darkeater Midir tho
[1:23:17] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> midir > kalmeet
[1:23:22] <andre11dr> Midir is cool ,he has to much health tho
[1:23:22] <nutimik> midir is even worse than sinh tbh
[1:23:24] <%Indigo_Automaton> @„Çª„Éì„Éº facts
[1:23:25] <+robertoszek> swamps know no bounds
[1:23:28] <+patriotrenegade> Midir is some high-grade bullshit
[1:23:30] <nutimik> midir is a massive slog
[1:23:40] <%Feralspirit41> Shortcut engaged
[1:23:49] <%Feralspirit41> The answer is dont question it
[1:23:57] <Crownaux0> better than DS2
[1:23:59] <+Shishi1205> you went uphill underground
[1:24:00] <bigshedman> Space is convoluted
[1:24:06] <nutimik> geometry is convoluted in yharnam
[1:24:06] <Louie_Salmon> Swam up a sewer waterfall
[1:24:11] <CappuccinoGuil> Who cares. video games are made up magical code that brute forces sand to think, space can be convoluted
[1:24:13] <cabaio> wibbity wobbity sewers
[1:24:28] <nutimik> this water is running down
[1:24:30] <%dds333a> @crownaux0 better than the volcano in the sky LUL
[1:24:36] <andre11dr> Honestly the worst dragon fight is still the Dragon God
[1:24:50] <%holydeviant1> oh shit more BB
[1:24:54] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> wobbly textures hint at reality bending
[1:24:57] <%Feralspirit41> I tried to rely on my mental map of the source material (which I havent touched in 3 years) to play this game and ended up getting lost for an hour
[1:25:11] <+patriotrenegade> you get some antidote in the poison area
[1:25:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @andre11dr I legit think some days that Dragon God is worse than BoC. some days.
[1:25:14] <%holydeviant1> @„Çª„Éì„Éº Naw, that's just how PSX era textures be
[1:25:46] <andre11dr> @cappuccinoguil Nah ,BoC is like actually unfinished

[1:26:07] <%Feralspirit41> he went into the sewer
[1:26:10] <%holydeviant1> God, can you imagine a chalice dungeon expansion to make a legit endgame challenge mode or roguelike mode?
[1:26:11] <%Feralspirit41> got the spear
[1:26:12] <otakon17> that's a level OR the goodies from the fountain

[1:26:45] <+Fetrigon> Big Brain Backdown
[1:26:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @andre11dr Oh I know, it's just a personal feeling and it wanes. That's how close I think they are to each other. How boring they can be.
[1:26:56] <%Feralspirit41> easily won the first round
[1:27:00] <velgaduere> @cobalt_phoenix_ Sabrewolf jumped out of KI and hit Woolie with an doodultra

[1:31:29] <Louie_Salmon> Something changed woolieFROG
[1:31:32] <+patriotrenegade> Read the brochure that came with the disc @WoolieVersus
[1:31:33] <%Feralspirit41> The booklet that came with the disc should tell you
[1:31:33] <foghornleghorn55> I beat the game and I couldn't figure out what it was
[1:31:34] <%Explodincatz> buy the Strategy Guide
[1:31:38] <nutimik> it respawns items
[1:31:42] <%Milosolaire> it re populates the items you pick up around the game
[1:31:42] <+Shishi1205> @KyberNasse can't spend it
[1:31:44] <FrostedZaibatsu> You thought it WOULDNT be obtuse woolieFROG
[1:31:46] <AstrodropGaming> The world tendency has changed LUL

[1:32:10] <KyberNasse> So theyre just Mario 64 power stars?
[1:32:11] <+Shishi1205> bullets and vials
[1:32:15] <%Indigo_Automaton> Now this is the true Soulsborne experience
[1:32:17] <+U_1___> apparently it respawns non unique items
[1:32:18] <GHouseduivel> I used to read word up magazine.
[1:32:18] <%Feralspirit41> @dds333a legit a lost art form. Everytime I buy an old game I make sure it has its book
[1:32:19] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> gotta do it 3 times for the real ending
[1:32:21] <+KBGuilty> It's not worth it lol
[1:32:24] <%X2Eliah> time to grind it back
[1:32:29] <%dds333a> @kybernasse same as always, polygonal Madman's Knowledge
[1:32:33] <nutimik> we're telling you reg lol

[1:33:26] <%Indigo_Automaton> Were Gameshark discs not until PS2? Or did PS1 have them too?
[1:33:35] <CappuccinoGuil> Game Genie time

[1:33:45] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> ps1 had a gameshark you plugged into the back.. i think?

[1:34:46] <KeiganOfAstora> Are they almost done with the game?
[1:34:49] <+Exicuren> "someone told that if you beat the game under 3 hours goku shows up and beats up scorpion"
[1:35:05] <%Indigo_Automaton> Man a Gameshark was the only reason I played through Resident Evil 4 when I was young. I was too scared of the game and didn't understand resource management so I used the infinite ammo cheat

[1:38:24] <velgaduere> lmfao
[1:38:24] <+mikesapartment> bro this game is too damn juicy
[1:38:25] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:38:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus for the secret area, you need to start a new game. Would recommend you do it when you finish. 100 times is super fast to do. Less than 1 minute
[1:38:26] <%LastHazzerd> :)
[1:38:26] <+Shishi1205> huh?
[1:38:28] <+patriotrenegade> PSX be like that
[1:38:29] <foghornleghorn55> hahaha peak fromsoft design
[1:38:31] <AstrodropGaming> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:38:33] <%ZweihanderSteve> there better be mew behind it
[1:38:34] <+robertoszek> buy the official guide
[1:38:37] <%Feralspirit41> 100 even
[1:38:37] <@Menitta> I think if you heat the console up, you can skip it Kappa
[1:38:42] <+KBGuilty> is that even real??
[1:38:48] <%SirGO0SE> etalWave etalWave
[1:38:49] <%Feralspirit41> Who knows
[1:38:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Just mash X
[1:38:59] <%dds333a> @menitta yeah, then the game's done Kappa
[1:39:04] <+patriotrenegade> mash a hundred times in a minute
[1:39:19] <nutimik> it's an easter egg basically
[1:39:22] <CappuccinoGuil> No it is not. What you have behind the game is a gravestone that teleports you back to the secret area.
[1:39:22] <%espanishcanamurciana> That interacting with (x) an absurd amount of times is very old school.  FF9 and RE2
[1:39:27] <RyuuAoi> Don't listen, Woolie! It's a lie!
[1:39:35] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus the locked door in Losefkas clinic when you start, look up a vid
[1:39:38] <Bonebagmel> spoiler or no spoiler
[1:39:46] <nutimik> it's not the same
[1:39:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus  No it is not. What you have behind the game is a gravestone that teleports you back to the secret area.
[1:39:47] <%dds333a> Reg's face LUL
[1:39:48] <DXLelouch24> Its new
[1:39:49] <andre11dr> I went and took a piss ,what happened?

[1:39:52] <bigshedman> Oh no is this a test? I didn't study!
[1:39:56] <%Xaeveax> Yeah gotta limit what Reggie gets to see.
[1:39:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:58] <BlackermanZX> you unlock the gate and you get a copy of bloodborne 2 woolieFROG
[1:40:01] <%Feralspirit41> im gonna check it out

[1:40:20] <%emptyantics> So uhhhh SIFU today?
[1:40:28] <GHouseduivel> Reggie has a nice smile :)
[1:40:37] <+Shishi1205> oh boy
[1:40:37] <+robertoszek> hmmmm
[1:40:45] <%emptyantics> hmmm maybe don't continue
[1:40:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> yeah that would be terrible
[1:40:50] <%dds333a> indeed it would be Kappa
[1:40:52] <%emptyantics> there's some stuff
[1:40:54] <RyuuAoi> It's just a dip of the toe for Reggie rn.
[1:40:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @WoolieVersus the secret area is isolated from the rest of the game. The dev put a gravestone that lets you teleport back to it. The secret area DOES have a new item and some cool features to explore. in other words, it has cool content.
[1:40:58] <%Feralspirit41> We're giving you the authentic psx experience, who the fuck knows if what we say is true
[1:41:02] <%LastHazzerd> even if it's different, is it safe for Reggie?
[1:41:11] <leith_aziz> Im back. I assume they finished the demo?

[1:43:06] <leith_aziz> Sifu isnt on Steam from what I understand
[1:43:06] <bigshedman> Never get out of fighting games LUL
[1:43:13] <RyuuAoi> @holydeviant1 Maybe it'll be announced for the Switch today? LUL
[1:43:17] <andre11dr> Granted i would be watching P2 FOR the struggle
[1:43:22] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz he's actually not wrong, the game is great, but it's not hugely conducive to this format
[1:43:27] <%Milosolaire> it repopulated items you already picked up
[1:43:29] <BlackermanZX> doesn't all the items reset or sumthin
[1:43:30] <leith_aziz> Is it on Steam?
[1:43:30] <@Menitta> also as we've seen from yesterday, Hard games mean nothing to Woolie.
[1:43:30] <+Shishi1205> Its just item respawning
[1:43:30] <DXLelouch24> We know but i aint telling
[1:43:45] <%dds333a> Raidou worked, but it could've gone way worse
[1:43:47] <RyuuAoi> @andre11dr RIGHT
[1:43:52] <+mechslayer71> nah, the streets are just watching bro.
[1:43:58] <nutimik> the streets have eyes
[1:44:11] <leith_aziz> @dds333a What does that have to do with me? Did you mistake my comments for someone else's?
[1:44:12] <%Xaeveax> There's people on the streets getting diseases from monkeys
[1:44:12] <%espanishcanamurciana> Eyes on these streets psaElmo

[1:44:36] <andre11dr> @ryuuaoi But the again if we want THE STRUGGLE we can always make him play Strange Journey
[1:44:45] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz by "we can handle it", were you referring to P2, or nonstop GIFG? LUL
[1:45:03] <%dds333a> @andre11dr woolieYE
[1:45:03] <RyuuAoi> @andre11dr Woolie will figure it out
[1:45:03] <leith_aziz> @dds333a I was reffering to fighting games and Dark Souls
[1:45:35] <leith_aziz> Noise? cohhM
[1:45:36] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz gotcha, but Souls wasn't part of the equation LUL

[2:11:48] <peachy996> What did the Doll just call you?
[2:11:59] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> so did fromsoft comment on this at all? miyazaki was interviewed extensively recently, I wonder if they asked him.
[2:12:23] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @TigerCatGo "sus" AND "ussy" wow
[2:13:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WhiteClaudiaMk Miyazaki: "did they include a poison swamp? then it's all good in my book" is what i'd like to think how it'd go
[2:13:18] <leith_aziz> @WhiteClaudiaMk I dont think there was any comment about this?
[2:13:30] <enerkaizer> question: Can this game actually run on a legit PS1?
[2:13:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but yeah i haven't heard anything from them
[2:13:38] <%dds333a> no
[2:13:38] <+Shishi1205> best gun

[2:13:50] <+vaderxyz1970> does it have a meat hook?
[2:13:52] <%Indigo_Automaton> WHAT
[2:13:54] <AstrodropGaming> SHOTGUN
[2:13:56] <%dds333a> This game isn't a PSX game despite the aesthetic LUL
[2:13:59] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> hey shawty
[2:14:12] <enerkaizer> @dds333a sad. doesn't that kinda defeat the porpouse of doing something like a demake?
[2:14:18] <+robertoszek> we DOOM now?
[2:14:20] <otakon17> SUPER SHOTGUN
[2:14:21] <leith_aziz> @enerkaizer Im gonna say probably not because of the intro being ingame cutscene. In reality, they'd make that shit CGI or a live action reel
[2:14:29] <%baka_sugoi> BUTT
[2:14:30] <@Menitta> it's built on unreal engine 4
[2:14:32] <nutimik> this is the gun to use if you want to kill and not parry
[2:14:37] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> this can probably be modified into running on a vita though
[2:14:37] <+theoldone001> @dds333a wHAT? yES IT IS, i PLAYED THIS AS A KID BACK IN 1997
[2:14:42] <leith_aziz> pickyBang
[2:14:46] <otakon17> that's a Tomb Raider lookin' shotty
[2:14:49] <sirrice77> it has crazy knockback
[2:14:57] <therabbles> almost evil dead
[2:15:00] <%dds333a> @enerkaizer one could say, but this is more like a project to get the look, more so than necessarily making a game for said hardware
[2:15:01] <otakon17> Now we DOOM
[2:15:11] <otakon17> click click BOOM
[2:15:12] <%dds333a> @theoldone001 LUL LUL
[2:15:14] <VincentGraves> yo it'
[2:15:17] <+Shishi1205> new
[2:15:36] <%Indigo_Automaton> This isn't in Bloodborne at all
[2:15:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:38] <leith_aziz> You cant just blow a hole into the surface of Yarnham!
[2:15:42] <%SirGO0SE> das a boomstick arite
[2:15:46] <cloudedrho> replacing the repeating pistol?
[2:15:52] <andre11dr> That looks a little to modern for thi setting
[2:15:52] <BearSawed> GROOVY
[2:15:57] <otakon17> like I could see a breach loading double barrel shotty work in this game but it needs more bandages and wear and tear on it
[2:15:57] <%dds333a> @leith_aziz it would be an FMV, and it wouldn't look like that LUL
[2:15:58] <%hax_metatron> You need Bloodtinge for that tho
[2:16:04] <%Indigo_Automaton> SHould have been like a lever action coachgun
[2:16:06] <velgaduere> people acting like this game didn't exist back in 1997 really shows the reason why we didn't get a remake until 2015 doodSad
[2:16:07] <nutimik> double barrel shotguns haven't changed much in quite a long time, so it's not a big reach in design
[2:16:09] <+Shishi1205> its a fuck off gun
[2:16:09] <%hax_metatron> With good Bloodtinge, you get "actual guns" in Bloodborne too
[2:16:13] <VincentGraves> it's the gun from the leaked trailer back in the day
[2:16:14] <otakon17> that's a "I need space" weapon
[2:16:21] <+khalcipher> Doesnt seem very blooborny tho
[2:16:23] <KyberNasse> Ash's Boom Stick
[2:16:33] <DueSquash> ELMER J FUDD SHOTGUN
[2:16:39] <%dds333a> @velgaduere LUL
[2:16:46] <otakon17> it still peeves me Bloodborne has NO ranged options for you while the enemies have rifles and shotguns GALORE they use against you

[2:16:51] <%dds333a> Hail to the king
[2:16:54] <%SirGO0SE> wabbit season
[2:17:06] <andre11dr> I guess the enemies do use guns like that but still
[2:17:06] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> @velgaduere we need better game archiving
[2:17:31] <velgaduere> @„Çª„Éì„Éº that's what I'm sayin man
[2:17:42] <velgaduere> such an underrated title smh
[2:17:53] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> whole generations of games, gone!
[2:17:57] <%pkthepipes> where's that in actual bloodyborne
[2:18:04] <%pkthepipes> I needs it
[2:18:08] <%dds333a> nowhere LUL
[2:18:14] <%arkv01> good hoonta farmer joe
[2:18:16] <velgaduere> removed in the remake
[2:18:16] <%G_Thunders> Pretty sure that shotgun is the same one the wheelchair guys use
[2:18:22] <DrkJP520> now we're playing re4
[2:18:23] <andre11dr> There's a minigun tho
[2:18:24] <CrimsonGargoyle> RING OUT
[2:18:24] <velgaduere> deemed too OP
[2:18:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> k bye LUL
[2:18:32] <andre11dr> But it kinda sucks
[2:18:34] <+theoldone001> That's an Alabama dad protecting his daughter shotgun
[2:18:39] <%Xaeveax> He tried courage
[2:18:39] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> hand cannons and mini guns‚Ä¶ but no shotgun allowed
[2:18:43] <oda_flobunaga> Puckle guns were a thing in the mid 1800s
[2:18:44] <%dds333a> @andre11dr correct, on both counts LUL
[2:18:58] <velgaduere> miraculously took no damage
[2:19:00] <+TopTieramisu> did the beast take the bullet?
[2:19:00] <nutimik> and the gun the yharnam dudes have is just a single barrel version
[2:19:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> honestly the big guns in bb feel underwhelming for their costs, granted i've never run a bloodtinge build
[2:19:26] <andre11dr> The Minigun would be cool if you got more bullets
[2:19:32] <%ZweihanderSteve> because of the audio quality I was expecting him to spout quotes from resident evil 4 LUL
[2:19:37] <velgaduere> @cobalt_phoenix_ try Bloodtinge church cannon :)
[2:19:55] <andre11dr> But it drains them so fast it's not worth
[2:19:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @velgaduere once i run through it again i will give it a go
[2:20:13] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> it was all about arcane builds with tentacle parries anyway
[2:20:15] <%goosematty> the real bloodborne psx was the friends we made along the way
[2:20:19] <+TopTieramisu> a viable gun would make bloodborne a very different game
[2:20:37] <%G_Thunders> Yeah a gun-only guild would make the whole rally system pointless
[2:20:59] <lotharrio> I did a bloodtinge build, it was pretty viable, but I wasn't able to be gun-only.
[2:21:17] <samuraijakanddaxter> Victorian era England coincides with "cowboy" era America, so double barrell shotgun is not out of place in that sense
[2:21:19] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> tentacle parry also meant you could run transformed moonblade and still riposte
[2:21:23] <andre11dr> I wish you could dual whiled guns and do some Trigun shit
[2:21:31] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> was beautiful
[2:22:39] <nutimik> why does woolie move away whenever he gets close to the keys lmao

[2:23:50] <jeetkunedoughnut> Or 8-bit?
[2:24:29] <%hax_metatron> This will be your favorite hallway later in the game with the new surprise LUL

[2:25:25] <andre11dr> Kigs Field Demake,it just an Atari game
[2:25:26] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> thatd just be castlevania at that  point

[2:26:06] <+TopTieramisu> king's field but it's isometric diablo style

[2:29:50] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> woolie and navigation, name a more iconic duo
[2:29:52] <+TopTieramisu> my head-canon is that miyazaki discretely sanctioned this demake on the condition they add a poison section
[2:30:14] <+Shishi1205> Pig town more like
[2:30:25] <+theoldone001> There's a hunter badge near boar in the OG right?

[2:32:32] <majindusto> Gotta Dodge
[2:32:38] <velgaduere> THIS IS THE REMIX TO (boulder) IGNITION
[2:32:41] <GHouseduivel> Put som Respec on my name
[2:32:48] <AstrodropGaming> Woolie stumbling into progress by any means necessary
[2:32:53] <majindusto> Pooe Reggie  getting  Spoiled  lol
[2:32:58] <%TigerCatGo> @ReallyBigRocks Why you everywhere, stopping my game progress???????
[2:33:03] <velgaduere> @majindusto he's fine, he'll forget
[2:33:07] <VincentGraves> some crash bandicoot shit
[2:33:25] <+TopTieramisu> let's hope enough time passes before his BB playthrough so he forgets everything he sees in this
[2:33:33] <%espanishcanamurciana> Shoot what I just miss?
[2:33:47] <cabaio> Pig and rocks
[2:33:47] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> its just the first zone anyway, theres plenty more to BB
[2:33:56] <Treasure_Vault> Is this by the two big dudes with the direction woolie missed? He might have checked it out, I was audio only for a while.
[2:33:57] <+robertoszek> close call
[2:34:00] <%holydeviant1> @TopTieramisu Ehhh, this doesn't seem to have any of the real shit
[2:34:02] <your_BellBoy> damn, i love this vibe
[2:34:17] <+TopTieramisu> @TopTieramisu yes, but the initial impression is very important
[2:34:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Did they beat Gascoiogne?
[2:34:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> @TigerCatGo look bro, im just an actor. I don't write the scripts
[2:34:51] <your_BellBoy> is this a fangame?
[2:34:59] <%holydeviant1> @your_BellBoy yep
[2:35:06] <your_BellBoy> baller
[2:35:08] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> do we need to make a comic of woolie putting a torch into then spokes of the bike he‚Äôs riding, and blaming the devs
[2:35:09] <GHouseduivel> We ain't found shit.
[2:35:24] <cabaio> When firearms don't work use fire directly
[2:35:35] <majindusto> Fire Indeed Hot
[2:35:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just go in with no torch Kappa
[2:35:53] <GHouseduivel> Fire, apply directly to forehead.
[2:36:02] <%TigerCatGo> @ReallyBigRocks Chris Redfield, of the Redfield Bloodline, would like a word with you.
[2:36:21] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Just started stream, have they beaten Father Gascoigne yet? I'm excited to see them react to the last bits of the fan game
[2:36:25] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm always doing it in the dark Kappa and by "doing it" I mean GAMING woolieFROG
[2:36:34] <samuraijakanddaxter> gaskwang up next
[2:36:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheRealGreaterGamer not yet
[2:36:41] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Perfect
[2:36:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1490976552661979140?t=ZdiSmYj01DtZhJb8xco6Ig&s=19
[2:37:04] <+Catpurnicus> my favorite megaman X boss is Boomer GasKwanger
[2:37:10] <%MrMoonGoose> @TheRealGreaterGamer Think they did Gasco during the first stream.
[2:37:18] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> gatekeep, gaslight, gascoine
[2:37:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Nah, they did Cleric
[2:37:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @MrMoonGoose that was cleric
[2:37:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> REEEE
[2:37:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Man, I sure love it when my build options are... strength or dex ResidentSleeper
[2:37:43] <samuraijakanddaxter> beat cleric beast first stream, not seen gascoigne yet
[2:37:55] <%MrMoonGoose> @TheRealGreaterGamer No, I meant Gasco. IIRC, they made it to the graveyard.
[2:37:57] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> so whats in this.. cleric, gasman, and [redacted] only?
[2:38:10] <CappuccinoGuil> @„Çª„Éì„Éº yes, 3 bosses
[2:38:28] <%TigerCatGo> I hope this Dev snuck in their BloodKart April Fools joke into this version....
[2:38:29] <+TopTieramisu> this game also introduces a later game enemy
[2:38:41] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> oh OH
[2:38:42] <velgaduere> @TopTieramisu shhhhhh
[2:38:44] <+Shishi1205> @TopTieramisu more like 3
[2:38:59] <velgaduere> keep it in your pants, chat woolieFROG
[2:39:08] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> @toptieramisu im looking forward to that, completely forgot
[2:39:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus The level design of this fan game is impeccable. Unfortunately you are correct in that the shortcuts you unlock aren't strictly that useful since the game itself is too short to warrant them. Still cool though!
[2:39:25] <samuraijakanddaxter> pumped to hear what gascoignes theme will sound like in this version
[2:39:40] <%Xaeveax> @samuraijakanddaxter It's very good.
[2:39:55] <CappuccinoGuil> Why not use the double barrel, though?
[2:40:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil parry tho
[2:40:22] <CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ double barrel doesn't cause parry?
[2:40:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @CappuccinoGuil i don't think so, just knockback
[2:40:40] <OldManDeckardCain> just daigo parry them Kappa
[2:40:43] <%holydeviant1> where are they getting so many boulders!?

[2:41:03] <%WutangchickeN> try courage

[2:41:06] <cabaio> are those flaming hayballs?

[2:41:42] <%holydeviant1> @b_primeaux It's a whole cloth fangame
[2:41:42] <nutimik> it's not a mod, it's a standalone game

[2:42:27] <leith_aziz> @agustorm123 The PS1 overalls will hopefully muddy up Reggie's memories once he plays the PS4 version cohhHmm
[2:42:29] <%Xaeveax> @OldManDeckardCain Why did that even make me laugh. But it did.
[2:42:35] <%WutangchickeN> can't wait for SKELETON BALL
[2:42:35] <+Catpurnicus> I love that the animation just has you falling up or down when you switch zones on a ladder
[2:42:48] <+Shackle_Rustyford> is that the boulder where the model of the guy pushing it clips into it when he pushes it and kills him
[2:43:00] <velgaduere> @Shackle_Rustyford the very same

[2:55:07] <Boegame> hahaha
[2:55:11] <%Xaeveax> Reggie is gonna be SO into the real Bloodborne when they eventually get to it.

[2:56:17] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> sadness in a souls game?!
[2:56:18] <velgaduere> left without the music box
[2:56:23] <velgaduere> not the brooch
[2:56:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> She didnt have the music box with her
[2:56:37] <%hax_metatron> You fill in the story Reggie, personally I think Gascoigne killed her in rage
[2:56:53] <%hax_metatron> Because the daughter says they used the music box to calm him down
[2:57:36] <nutimik> the music box makes gascoigne remember she said
[2:57:37] <leith_aziz> pickyTears
[2:57:54] <TheRealGreaterGamer> But she didn't have the music box to calm him down. Playing it during the fight angers him. Probably because he regrets killing her/remembers his family.
[2:57:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:58:04] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus music box doesnt do shit in demake, i tried and he gave no fucks
[2:58:07] <%Xaeveax> Now you get to save it for the real deal
[2:58:10] <DXLelouch24> killed my ass
[2:58:12] <nutimik> it does work
[2:58:16] <velgaduere> for RIGHT AFTER ELDEN RING PogBones
[2:58:16] <kazataca> when.....
[2:58:19] <DXLelouch24> well doesnt work well
[2:58:20] <Boegame> we leave that for sometime in the next 20 years :V
[2:58:27] <nutimik> you probably did it while he was in an attack animation
[2:58:29] <+robertoszek> @TheRealGreaterGamer or maybe just because you're not as hot as his dead wife
[2:58:31] <DXLelouch24> it was instant in BB regular
[2:58:45] <GHouseduivel> Reggie the en"LIGHT"ened
[2:58:46] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus big one guy it wors the same
[2:58:52] <andre11dr> Surely Reggie will remember that 2 year from now Kappa
[2:58:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @robertoszek LMAO
[2:59:08] <%G_Thunders> It absolutely works, the timing is just tough once he‚Äôs transformed cause he‚Äôs so fast. Same as original
[2:59:11] <Dakuu75> I legit dunno if itll play out the same
[2:59:21] <samuraijakanddaxter> playing ds2 after bloodborne would be such a comedown, so i hope reggie still plays them in order
[2:59:32] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus The music box does work the same way
[2:59:33] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> ^
[2:59:33] <%holydeviant1> His fight in the actual game is when the game says "This is how a REAL hunter does combat
[2:59:34] <leith_aziz> ER is gonna be my second attempt at trying to get into Souls games. 1st was BB, but I feel like I didnt give it a fair attempt as I sucked at it and kept getting lost
[2:59:37] <TheRealGreaterGamer> HOLY SHIT THAT STRENGTH
[2:59:45] <cloudedrho> gonna check out your hunter ax?
[3:00:00] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:00:00] <+Finnmac5> Fun Fact: In the Alpha version of this game Gascoigne is implied to be from Boletaria the setting of Demon Souls. This is from his set "Father is another term for cleric, used in a distant land" and from his cut dialog where he says "Umbasa" as part of a prayer after killing the player @WoolieVersus
[3:00:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @TheRealGreaterGamer yeah Pat's not here Kappa
[3:00:05] <GHouseduivel> @leith_aziz Its also a major stray away from the regular Souls Combat
[3:00:09] <+Shishi1205> use the axe then
[3:00:10] <penitentpendant> M-m-m-min MAXIMUM
[3:00:11] <+swesterly> YEAH STRENGTH REDEMPTION ARC
[3:00:12] <Dakuu75> The ace is a mega-chungus in this
[3:00:13] <nutimik> or you get more stamina and be able to hit more often
[3:00:16] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[3:00:18] <+Ryukashin94> hit em with a lil ghetto gospel
[3:00:18] <velgaduere> @Finnmac5 he knows :)
[3:00:19] <GHouseduivel> MORE POWAH
[3:00:20] <%Indigo_Automaton> ADDICTED TO POWER
[3:00:21] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> BB is a souls game that can only be played one way, dark souls allow you a chance to choose how to engage with it
[3:00:23] <AngryAsian5> Do the BIG DAMAGE
[3:00:28] <Boegame> I NEED POWER
[3:00:32] <TheRealGreaterGamer> WE SWITCHING TO THE AXE NOW RIGHT?
[3:00:34] <Dr_Mooose> you see these arms!
[3:00:35] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie is going to saw the earth in fucking half
[3:00:38] <$Rafraud> 1
[3:00:41] <GHouseduivel> Wheres the Palpatine emote?
[3:00:42] <%ZweihanderSteve> D! P! S! D! P! S!
[3:00:43] <SaiyanShoto> Woolie likes the one big punch instead of small multiple ones
[3:00:43] <%Xaeveax> He's on his way to becoming GIANT
[3:00:43] <%G_Thunders> @finnmac5 dataminers found that early game files were labeled as demon‚Äôs souls 2, so yeah early in dev this was supposed to be a sequel
[3:00:44] <GHouseduivel> LUL
[3:00:48] <nutimik> stat scaling sucks in this demake dude, stamina and vitality are the most important
[3:00:49] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> same reason i havent touched sekiro, im just not into parry builds
[3:00:56] <$Rafraud> Woolie would make a great FFXIV Healer
[3:00:58] <velgaduere> not leveling END is the equivalent of skipping leg day
[3:01:04] <+swesterly> @„Çª„Éì„Éº builds are a thing in BB wdym

[3:01:23] <%ZweihanderSteve> if you got a swing first make sure it's the only time woolieKICKDAD
[3:01:25] <+Jiggisnipe> I get that BB is part of the Soulsborne stuff but it's pretty distinct from Des, DS, and DS2
[3:01:28] <samuraijakanddaxter> endurance is a lot more generous in bloodborne than the souls games tbf
[3:01:28] <DueSquash> My goal when playing DS2 is to find something about it I like
[3:01:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's come a long way, you love to see it
[3:01:30] <cabaio> when is a number too big?
[3:01:40] <%holydeviant1> @Rafraud He'd also play a mean MtG Black deck. THE ONLY POINT THAT MATTERS IS THE LAST ONE
[3:01:45] <leith_aziz> @DueSquash Powerstance
[3:01:49] <velgaduere> 99 strength or BUST
[3:01:50] <SaiyanShoto> Why leave it at 29? Might as well make it a clean 30
[3:01:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @cabaio when you no longer get stats or meet requirements IMO
[3:01:58] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> @swesterly builds yes, but play style is parry/regain/dodge only, no shield, no viable casting (source, i plat‚Äôd it with an arcane build)
[3:02:04] <cloudedrho> can you buy anything new with the new badge?
[3:02:05] <+robertoszek> @G_Thunders I see, what you're saying is that they should play BB now before DkS 2, because it's really DeS 2
[3:02:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> If we're going to 30, we might as well hit the 40 soft cap. Kappa
[3:02:19] <+robertoszek> @G_Thunders Kappa
[3:02:22] <+swesterly> @DueSquash modCheck good luck
[3:02:50] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It's by the two trolls inside the mansion on the way to the elevator. lol
[3:02:53] <+Finnmac5> He doesnt know Kappa
[3:02:56] <cabaio> the environment in DkS2 looks great
[3:02:58] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus WRONG
[3:03:02] <BlackermanZX> go to wheelchair grandpa house
[3:03:04] <DXLelouch24> go to oedon gate
[3:03:13] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Doll is probably inside?
[3:03:28] <DueSquash> Thats the only thing going for DS2. Powerstance & Fashion. Everything else is hotdog water
[3:03:31] <%Xaeveax> @DXLelouch24 He specifically wants to avoid that for spoilers.
[3:03:36] <+robertoszek> prepare for some hot mashing action
[3:03:42] <Boegame> I love everything about DS2, its the best
[3:03:50] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> tell ya what i hated about BB though, not being able to try a weapon without spending stats to equip it
[3:03:57] <Zeikier> b a s e m e n t
[3:04:01] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> that drove me nuts
[3:04:05] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus STOP there is EXTRA not in base game shit in this demake, try to open the gate at Oedon chapel lantern

[3:04:16] <DXLelouch24> trust me
[3:04:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It's by the two trolls inside the mansion on the way to the elevator to Gascoigne.
[3:04:27] <deadstockbrain> It would be sick if they did the whole game but the fact that this exists at all is sick
[3:04:28] <leith_aziz> I havent played any Souls game proper, so I have no bias or disdain towards any Souls game pickyAYAYA
[3:04:35] <Boegame> @Reverend_Roscoe why do you think so?
[3:04:38] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @boegame but as long as you like it
[3:04:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @DXLelouch24 you talking about the secret area?

[3:06:12] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @boegame im being overly antagonistic but i think ds2 is very rough
[3:06:19] <%atlasdotwav> WE WANT CONFLICT wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[3:06:20] <samuraijakanddaxter> do whatever you want woolie lol
[3:06:20] <nutimik> but the best content of the game is after the gate!!
[3:06:21] <Boegame> @Reverend_Roscoe Its slow and tactical, there is an astonishing amount of build variety, the story is awesome, love the world, love the bosses
[3:06:23] <RyuuAoi> It was all a lie? He lied? I told you!
[3:06:29] <%G_Thunders> The game progression was clearly designed to surprise you with what happens when you open the gate, not backtrack all the way to basement because you psychically know about stuff
[3:06:30] <kingra> @hax_metatron There's nothing explicitly from bloodborne after this point
[3:06:30] <%Prevot> woolieMIRIN woolieVS woolieONEGUY
[3:06:33] <FrostedZaibatsu> Shield your eyes Reggie
[3:06:34] <%sporeian94> Futurama is getting fucking rebooted AGAIN by Hulu
[3:06:35] <+KBGuilty> Do basement first then the gate.
[3:06:35] <+robertoszek> easy, throw a coin to decide
[3:06:36] <SaintSalted> woolieCRAB_SG cool crab woolieCRAB_SG
[3:06:40] <DrkJP520> basement is "safest"
[3:06:42] <GHouseduivel> @Prevot +2
[3:06:45] <JakxTheStampede> I personally did Basement before and would recommend it
[3:06:46] <%Milosolaire> house basement first. Gas gate ramps up difficulty of everything.
[3:06:47] <+patriotrenegade> Opening the gate triggers a world state change that spoils late game themes and plot
[3:06:48] <%HeroToxiko> @Reverend_Roscoe vanilla ds2 was so rough they had a miller lite trash texture in the gutter
[3:06:48] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> i think most ppl who like ds2 are willing to accept its not the best.. its just not as bad as ppl make out either
[3:06:49] <+swesterly> the ideal order will be basement first, then interact with gate after gascoigne, then make your way back to central yarnham lantern
[3:06:51] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Basement now is intended bc as you have seen you get the key b4 gascoigne
[3:06:53] <BlackermanZX> tf the basement is fine
[3:06:54] <DXLelouch24> how selective is Reggies memory?
[3:06:55] <+KBGuilty> basement is totally new no spoiledrs there
[3:06:57] <Louie_Salmon> A vote would be the most democratic
[3:06:57] <%hax_metatron> @kingra Have you SEEN the explicit chase segment? It LITERALLY spoils the second half of Bloodborne
[3:06:58] <CappuccinoGuil> Reggie will probably forget a lot of things by the time we get there LUL
[3:06:58] <%atlasdotwav> Is it possible that this is true? woolieFABRICATION
[3:06:58] <%Feralspirit41> Chapel gate is progress
[3:07:01] <andre11dr> Basement should be safe
[3:07:05] <nutimik> it's a pretty minor thing to get spoiled on honestly, plus the thing to be spoiled is different than in the original game
[3:07:12] <+ALazo> bosh rush
[3:07:14] <%Feralspirit41> Basement should be safe. Its a new area
[3:07:14] <Treasure_Vault> I hope basement is AoT spoilers
[3:07:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> How good is Reggie's memory?
[3:07:16] <samuraijakanddaxter> dont really want reggie seeing the central twist of the game if thats what it is
[3:07:16] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus some early cameos
[3:07:21] <Zeikier> yeah Bloodborne Vanilla certainly has its share of cool things
[3:07:22] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Basement first. Because there are *some* changes after. I have no idea what the deal with Iosefka's clinic is in the demake. And Reggie being spoiled isnt a concern.
[3:07:22] <leith_aziz> I just showed up. Seems soemthing happened pickyLurk
[3:07:22] <nutimik> it's 1 thing
[3:07:24] <%hax_metatron> But it's a thematic spoiler, I wouldn't want Reggie to find out about the twists in the game
[3:07:24] <foghornleghorn55> spoiler is mild
[3:07:29] <nutimik> and not too bad
[3:07:29] <BlackermanZX> its completely fine
[3:07:30] <+TrevSmith222> You wont see any MAJOR late game spoilers.
[3:07:38] <+Jack8274> Woolie, I love you, but you are the worst person in the world with spoilers LUL
[3:07:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's the main twist of the game
[3:07:41] <+robertoszek> @Make_me_mad LMAO
[3:07:41] <%Tearonex> @WoolieVersus  There aren't any big spoilers at all
[3:07:50] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus the basement is a new location with an amalgamation of old content. the gate is ALL BRAND NEW
[3:07:50] <nutimik> it's not the main twist at all
[3:07:51] <%Milosolaire> You can do the basement after the gate but it will be harder
[3:07:52] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus how selective is Reggies memory?
[3:07:52] <Louie_Salmon> @make_me_mad Damn, raw level 3
[3:07:53] <+KBGuilty> There is nothing major in either of the two paths
[3:07:56] <Zeikier> the basement isn't a point of no return if that's what you're asking?
[3:07:56] <+KBGuilty> spoiler wise
[3:07:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Spoilers aren't a concern.
[3:07:59] <leith_aziz> @„Çª„Éì„Éº Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a reasonable opinion in front of us
[3:08:02] <+swesterly> Basement then Gate
[3:08:11] <samuraijakanddaxter> theres a massive shift that happens in the story of this game, if its to do with that id avoid it for Reggie's sake, its such a cool surprise
[3:08:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus It was ONE GUY
[3:08:12] <+swesterly> Spoilers are not an issue
[3:08:14] <Boegame> @WoolieVersus no major spoilers after the gate, you are fine
[3:08:19] <+Shishi1205> Its some cameos not more
[3:08:25] <+patriotrenegade> @WoolieVersus Touching the gate causes Winter Lanterns to spawn
[3:08:28] <nutimik> It's not that bad
[3:08:28] <BlackermanZX> Basement, gate and then something else after
[3:08:28] <andre11dr> Basement is all new shit ,should be fine
[3:08:31] <leith_aziz> cohhHmm
[3:08:35] <+Shishi1205> @patriotrenegade SHUSH
[3:08:36] <RyuuAoi> Reggie will remember that
[3:08:37] <Jkhmn12> @sporeian94 Jesus it's been almost 10 years since the last season happy to see it back I guess I was Fine where it ended
[3:08:37] <CappuccinoGuil> Guys, remember, they are doing DS2 first, and for that, Woolie has to finish his own solo playthrough. WE'RE *TWO* DS2 playthrough's away from BB LUL
[3:08:41] <%hax_metatron> I PROMISE when they see that moment, Woolie will regret going ahead. Write this down
[3:08:44] <+seylumie> Continuing is super reasonable yes
[3:08:54] <%G_Thunders> @woolieversus neither option is about spoilers. Just ask yourself if you would‚Äôve tried the gate if no one said anything
[3:08:58] <DXLelouch24> Patriot wtf dont steal that terror Woolie will have from me
[3:09:03] <Boegame> DS2's chunky THICC ass saving us from spoilers!
[3:09:06] <nutimik> it's not game ruining
[3:09:10] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Do gate LAST because it will change areas permanently.
[3:09:20] <%Bread_Assassin> Don‚Äôt blueball us now for the sake of a playthrough in like 2-3 years.
[3:09:28] <+MacDoodle16> GET THEIR ASS
[3:09:31] <leith_aziz> @sporeian94 Wait, really? Im kinda asking myself why. It had a good ending, and a lot of shows suffer from the opposite. Dont take that away

[3:10:50] <Dakuu75> Dude, i dont think ANYTHING in this demake is MORE spoilery than what what you‚Äôve all ready seen. It‚Äôs super-fine
[3:10:50] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Touching the gate changes things permanently. The basement included. Spoilers aren't a conern.

[3:12:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus does it matter the order if you have a save game?
[3:12:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus The only thing I'm not sure of is the Iosefka's clinic door
[3:12:29] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Let us know after you see the content what you think about it

[3:12:51] <%SirGO0SE> woolieSHOOK sajamShoot sajamSmoked
[3:12:52] <nutimik> after the gate is the mild spoilers, basement isn't really spoilers imo
[3:12:54] <%OrangeMDT> All these spoiler fears when Reggie still has to go through DS2 woolieMIRIN
[3:12:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lol what did the dumbass say I missed it
[3:12:56] <peachy996> You don't want to spoil youself on certain enemies
[3:12:56] <%atlasdotwav> Grisham?
[3:13:05] <Gelphaze> Tough call!
[3:13:07] <Zebroneath> That sounds about right
[3:13:10] <+Shishi1205> 100%
[3:13:13] <+robertoszek> Basements are always filled with spoilers, huh
[3:13:15] <+seylumie> He will know whats coming before it appears, he can always back out
[3:13:15] <Dopamien> yea that lmao
[3:13:16] <velgaduere> @WoolieVersus I did just remember that there is a single enemy spoiler after gate. I don't think you'll mind it much though
[3:13:17] <+swesterly> absolutely being overblown
[3:13:19] <%Lion_kun> No be surprised Woolz
[3:13:21] <Boegame> its is, really overblown :V
[3:13:23] <Dakuu75> @orangemdt He wont remember any of this
[3:13:28] <%sporeian94> spoiler: knock 1 million times on the clinic door and you get a dating sim with all the Soulsborne waifus
[3:13:33] <nutimik> gottem
[3:13:37] <Treasure_Vault> I dunno, Reggie will be psyched by the original version of anything
[3:13:38] <$Rafraud> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
[3:13:39] <stevenellis386> dont worry @WoolieVersus just start the game. Who cares what some bumass loser says
[3:13:41] <velgaduere> lmfao
[3:13:41] <@Solidus_113> A certain frenzy monster with a memorable sound starts to spawn
[3:13:42] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus A cool enemy is added. And some enemies from Mensis. No boss. No areas. Mostly new content, including some enemies.
[3:13:42] <samuraijakanddaxter> ignore that one guy lol
[3:13:44] <%HeroToxiko> ultraaaaaa
[3:13:45] <%jinking79> and ppl wonder y anime watcher hate the chat

[3:13:51] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Hey Reggie, do you care about spoilers?
[3:13:52] <%Xaeveax> Good thing there are no more assholes here, right? RIGHT? woolieFROG
[3:13:52] <Teradyne87> Assholes have browneyes on the inside
[3:13:54] <@Solidus_113> after touching the gate
[3:13:55] <yukichocomilk> damn that guy in chat sounded like a total loser
[3:13:56] <peachy996> No considering Reggie hasn't played yet there are some things that must be kept secret
[3:13:57] <%arkv01> still boggles my mind we haven't filtered out all the assholes after a decade
[3:13:59] <MinersLoveGames> Better safe than sorry.
[3:14:02] <RyuuAoi> Fucking dumb ass guy
[3:14:06] <%IGgy_IGsen> I haven't played this yet but I'm guess whatever spoilery stuff there is left might be in a different context entirely now
[3:14:06] <Treasure_Vault> Speaking as someone who doesn't know, Reggie is a lovely sport who will forget the details by the time he tastes it
[3:14:06] <peachy996> Woolie is in the right here
[3:14:07] <+Shishi1205> dlc and mensis references
[3:14:12] <Zeikier> woolie, thoughts on Gascoigne's theme sounding like Nakoruru's theme from SamSho

[3:14:16] <Nmiser> Have they said are they going to watch the direct?
[3:14:18] <Boegame> wow, reggie will see a winter lantern, what a fucking spoiler :V
[3:14:20] <HarshNerf> madman's insight ticks up
[3:14:20] <SaiyanShoto> Is it really a spoiler when you don‚Äôt know the context?
[3:14:25] <andre11dr> Spoilers, when you open the door, Lady Maria starts twerking to a EDM remix of the Hunters Dream Theme
[3:14:26] <etnoika> Is Woolie not streaming the Nintendo Direct?
[3:14:28] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> i mean, shouldnt reggie have a say on this, its him we‚Äôre screeching over
[3:14:30] <samuraijakanddaxter> id rather reggie wasnt spoiled on the central twist but i don't think woolie is being selfish lmao
[3:14:30] <KeiganOfAstora> Trust us
[3:14:32] <+robertoszek> if this wasn't brought up I don't think Reggie would even process it as an spolier, anyway...
[3:14:32] <nutimik> tbh I really would've wanted to see Woolie's unspoiled reaction to the post-gate content
[3:14:37] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @arkv01 yeah, sucks what happened to Lil V with those asshats
[3:14:39] <%Xaeveax> @Nmiser They said they will see how they feel at the time.
[3:14:39] <peachy996> @Boegame that'd be pretty big
[3:14:47] <Boegame> thats like saying you are spoiled because you saw the weapons on the cover
[3:14:49] <KeiganOfAstora> Considering Reggie won't play Bloodborne for a long time he may not even remember
[3:14:50] <Nmiser> @Xaeveax Cool thx
[3:14:59] <Wahrow> Woolie watches a full playthrough of the demake at 2x speed
[3:15:05] <+swesterly> people worried about egs are funny
[3:15:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Hi Reggie!
[3:15:08] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Sad Woolie has to ruin his first impression of the demake twist just to make sure Reggie is safe due to one guy.
[3:15:12] <peachy996> @Boegame it's not just looking at it though you're fighting the enemy
[3:15:14] <%jinking79> sorry bout this Reggie
[3:15:15] <+robertoszek> Reggie! Favorite PSX game?
[3:15:15] <%SirGO0SE> we protecc
[3:15:18] <velgaduere> don't talk to us Reggie, people are just spoiling the things Woolie's looking up in chat
[3:15:19] <peachy996> You will know the mechanics
[3:15:19] <RyuuAoi> He is on Twitter now messaging Woolie like Woolie in the wrong ha
[3:15:20] <DueSquash> HI REGGIE
[3:15:21] <GHouseduivel> Hi Reggie :)
[3:15:21] <%sporeian94> Reggie Futurama is getting rebooted. Thoughts?
[3:15:22] <SaiyanShoto> Hola Reggie
[3:15:27] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> thing is, woolie‚Äôs reaction to the enemy in question wouldve been hype, oh well
[3:15:27] <Boegame> @peachy996 not in the demake you aren't, you are supposed to run away
[3:15:28] <+Shishi1205> Its a nod to fans. Like hey remember?
[3:15:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> They kinda do
[3:15:35] <+swesterly> there are not end game spoilers
[3:15:38] <penitentpendant> I mean, they go their own way after a while
[3:15:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ReggieVs Chat
[3:15:42] <HarshNerf> it's tuff either way
[3:15:44] <@Solidus_113> it's not quite endgame. no specific bosses, but a couple enemy types
[3:15:52] <RyuuAoi> No! We must protect U Reggie!
[3:15:55] <Ziegsy> do the enemies have any context?  or is it just 'ooh look'
[3:15:56] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus The most iconic enemy is added, along with Mensis enemies. Nothing else.
[3:15:58] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus gate is all new to the entire Bloodborne content, id really like you too see it blind.
[3:15:58] <Dakuu75> Dunno why chat is coddling the fuck outa Reggie today
[3:16:00] <+patriotrenegade> I just think that Reggie encountering a winter lanter for the first time in his own playthrough would be an absolute golden moment
[3:16:05] <nutimik> if no one said anything Reggie wouldn't even know
[3:16:05] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I think the enemy it spoils is more memorable than some bosses, but that's just me
[3:16:07] <FullMetalEmblem> joined the stream late, is woolie gonna stream the direct later?
[3:16:10] <+robertoszek> they are just enemies that look out of Demon's Souls
[3:16:11] <kazataca> if it's enemy types... some enemies are very special lore wise
[3:16:12] <Boegame> @Ziegsy its really just "ooh look"
[3:16:12] <peachy996> @Boegame Okay yeah, Woolie who has played the game before will just run away uh-huh
[3:16:13] <HarshNerf> Reggie defenders roll out
[3:16:15] <nutimik> SEE
[3:16:20] <@Solidus_113> the frenzy heads
[3:16:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> WE KNOW LUL
[3:16:21] <Zeikier> ask pat he can prolly give a more cogent piece of advice for going forward
[3:16:22] <sirrice77> There's late game enemy spoilers and that the game state can change but thats it
[3:16:22] <Teradyne87> This is out of my wheelhouse, I'm  still hyped and waiting for FF6
[3:16:23] <%Shad0wTag> @woolieversus Hey Reggie have you been watching anything new worth mentioning? I figured while we wait for Woolz?
[3:16:23] <+Shishi1205> thank you
[3:16:24] <RyuuAoi> Are u having sex on VDay Reggie?
[3:16:26] <Wahrow> It's not a big deeeeaaal, we can handle it
[3:16:28] <Boegame> @peachy996 either that or he will get killed immediately
[3:16:30] <+bearwagon> @FullMetalEmblem bruh lol
[3:16:33] <peachy996> Which one is it
[3:16:37] <+KBGuilty> @RyuuAoi wtf like
[3:16:39] <Boegame> @peachy996 either way, not seeing much of it
[3:16:43] <Boegame> see?
[3:16:47] <%atlasdotwav> Plus it's LOW POLY
[3:16:47] <%sporeian94> Don't worry Reggie will forget when Bloodborne finally comes to PC in 2055
[3:16:51] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> thats what we tried to say, us the reasonable masses

[3:17:24] <Wahrow> Reggie gets super excited about hockey and I'm all for it
[3:17:28] <+theoldone001> Woolie had that face like oh shit what did you see?!
[3:17:39] <%sporeian94> What about The Blackhawks owner who freaked out during that press confrence? He still around?
[3:17:42] <foghornleghorn55> when are you guys streaming the nhl game?
[3:17:44] <GHouseduivel> Well being in LAST PLACE, helps you get fired.
[3:17:49] <%SirGO0SE> @sporeian94 fuck him
[3:17:54] <peachy996> Which area is this mysterious spoiler enemy first encountered?
[3:17:55] <nutimik> if no one said anything reggie wouldn't even have known
[3:17:58] <+Shishi1205> The context is also different
[3:18:02] <+thesw1tch> @sporeian94 considering they own the team, who's going to fire them
[3:18:09] <peachy996> I guess we'll know later nevermind
[3:18:16] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> @nutimik truth
[3:18:23] <Treasure_Vault> Nintendo direct in halfish an hour, oh what fun for stream choices
[3:18:32] <%KiwamiKiryu> KiwamiKiryu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hey Woolie and Reggie, job is going better so I'm able to support once more! Thanks for all the laughs and great moments. Sorry about you dealing with some rudeness this stream. Much love from Mexico üòÅ
[3:18:35] <Dakuu75> Imagine if streamers would yell spoilers at chat, after chat spoiled shit for the streamer lol
[3:18:40] <Ziegsy> 30 mins folks! ready to be disappointed?
[3:18:47] <+Jiggisnipe> you know chat, you can make something a spoiler by drawing attention to it and giving it context, keep that in mind next time
[3:18:47] <GHouseduivel> @thesw1tch The League can vote to force you to sell.
[3:18:50] <RyuuAoi> Its ok,Woolie. He deserved it.
[3:18:54] <HarshNerf> @dakuu75 some streamers do it LUL
[3:18:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @dakuu75 spoiler alert, I fucked your mom!
[3:19:00] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig Spoliers
[3:19:09] <%sporeian94> I don't wanna hype anyone up, but ATLUS today is dumping all the old Persona trailers on their channel today...
[3:19:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:19:11] <foghornleghorn55> not even a mini boss
[3:19:12] <Dakuu75> @harshnerf GOOD! Lol
[3:19:12] <RyuuAoi> Its just a dip of the toe
[3:19:13] <GHouseduivel> @thesw1tch Also comes with the risk of that owner of dropping mad dirt if they have to.
[3:19:13] <nutimik> the enemy gets recontextualized anyway, it's very different
[3:19:14] <peachy996> @Jiggisnipe But I am chat.
[3:19:20] <KyberNasse> Chat going FFXIV stream chat mode
[3:19:24] <+theoldone001> Is it the Ayy LMAO?
[3:19:25] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @sporeian94 yooooo say what
[3:19:29] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus In the end, I believe it is a valid concern. But yes, in terms of spoilers it isn't anything to be worried about.
[3:19:31] <andre11dr> @ziegsy Not only am i ready ,I'M HYPED for the disappointment
[3:19:31] <%jinking79> if u wanted Woolie to go in blind don't yell it out
[3:19:39] <bigshedman> What I miss? Did people yell out spoilers (again)?
[3:19:40] <%Xaeveax> Gotta head out now guys. Enjoy the rest of the game!
[3:19:43] <FrostedZaibatsu> Like zombie Atorias
[3:19:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> BASEMENT TIME LUL
[3:19:45] <Zeikier> Reggie's experience will not be affected seeing both this and the original
[3:19:47] <%thesw1tch> @ghouseduivel yeah... do you know how valuable the hawks are? they arent going to force him to sell over getting mad at a reporter if they didn't do anything for the actual terrible shit
[3:19:47] <HarshNerf> @dakuu75 yeah i got desensitized to chat spoilers after becoming a twitch lord gdolphLG
[3:19:49] <sirrice77> Also spoils some weapons i think but none of the weird ones
[3:19:54] <%SirGO0SE> souls are serious business
[3:19:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie to be fair, we don't know what you do and don't consider a spoiler in some regards
[3:19:59] <nutimik> leaned on the brakes hard, now we gotta rev it up again
[3:20:02] <Dopamien> chat projecting onto the streamer, whats new EleGiggle
[3:20:05] <peachy996> All this drama on a demake, what is even happening
[3:20:05] <andre11dr> Sometimes you gotta gun jump
[3:20:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so a lot will err on the safe side
[3:20:11] <Nmiser> eet ees what eet ees
[3:20:11] <samuraijakanddaxter> we love the drama

[3:20:42] <%G_Thunders> Woolie would‚Äôve heard the enemy type before seeing it, and if it was a catastrophic spoiler for him he would‚Äôve just reloaded his save. This did not have to be a thing

[3:21:25] <%Proxzo> "That's metal, in your lungs!"
[3:21:31] <GHouseduivel> @thesw1tch That's what I meant, unless the feds show up arresting an owner they won't force a sell.
[3:21:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @pepinillomaton you're good
[3:21:39] <Insectorbass> Yo that dithering.
[3:21:41] <RyuuAoi> Woolie banned his first chat. Cherry popped
[3:21:44] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @pepinillomaton juicy bits to go back to after the stream in the VOD
[3:21:49] <nutimik> wait wtf new futurama? without dimaggio?
[3:21:50] <velgaduere> "he's not blinking, for he is dead"
[3:21:52] <+Shishi1205> trolls
[3:21:52] <%LordSDB> @peachy996 Glad to see the news is real, but worried what are they even gonna do now? Everything was honestly wrapped up proper and wholesome at that.
[3:21:54] <Zeikier> chat needs a lesson in keeping people's socks intact
[3:21:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Cut to Reggie crying at the end of the stream that we ruined Bloodborne for him LUL
[3:22:03] <BlackermanZX> you ran past that door like 6 times

[3:22:24] <%thesw1tch> @ghouseduivel ah yeah. you're absolutely right
[3:22:27] <+yungkame> lmao i love the ff7 ass health bars
[3:22:29] <peachy996> @LordSDB Futurama is so weird cuz it's got several different potential series endings.
[3:22:30] <Gelphaze> I think its where you found the pig.
[3:22:35] <peachy996> I will miss DiMaggio
[3:22:36] <+Shishi1205> @Gelphaze no
[3:22:44] <%dds333a> @samuraijakanddaxter just like Jessi Slaughter
[3:22:47] <GHouseduivel> @thesw1tch That or hardcore racism on tape ala Donald Sterling of the Clippers
[3:22:48] <+Jiggisnipe> @peachy996 and it's last ending left the door open for more lol
[3:22:50] <+Shishi1205> Its in the room with the 2 ogres
[3:22:55] <%dds333a> Randy bo Bandy
[3:22:57] <%TheBigPutty> now eventually reggie will have to blink twice by human nature, at which case he will not be okay

[3:23:27] <TheRealGreaterGamer> LUL
[3:23:29] <peachy996> I like DiMaggio, I thought he was a decent Joker in Under The Red Hood
[3:23:32] <peachy996> He was different
[3:23:35] <+Shishi1205> right now
[3:23:39] <Ziegsy> I dunno, they can always get that guy who voiced heidegger in 7 remake. he was good  ziegsyGaga
[3:23:40] <pepinillomaton> get sandwiched
[3:23:41] <Dopamien> SMOrc me go
[3:23:48] <+WhiteClaudiaMk> the torch is a spoiler woolie
[3:23:50] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> dimaggio crossing the streams with ffx, futurama and adventure time in my mind
[3:23:54] <Gelphaze> Shishi1205@ AAAAHHHH
[3:24:00] <%dds333a> @peachy996 he was good, I liked my dosage of "hoarse Joker"
[3:24:18] <drunken_lemur> @peachy996 Yeah, him and Kevin Michael Richardson are really underappreciated as the Joker.
[3:24:20] <+Shishi1205> time for plop
[3:24:32] <@Solidus_113> AoT
[3:24:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THAT FUCKIN BASEMENT
[3:24:33] <Gelphaze> Shishi1205 YEA
[3:24:36] <asakura_ayase> It was
[3:24:38] <%LordSDB> @peachy996 That is true, but the last one was a pretty big "THE END" a show could do. I hope its worth it
[3:24:44] <BlackermanZX> it... may not be worth it later
[3:24:45] <nutimik> too bad the ending of AoT is garbage
[3:24:48] <+DrFacilier> i cant wait to find out about the outside world :D

[3:28:26] <FrostedZaibatsu> Sekiro?

[3:28:27] <Dopamien> WutFace oh god
[3:28:27] <%dds333a> It was an idea
[3:28:30] <%ZweihanderSteve> God damn it Will you find this shit
[3:28:32] <GHouseduivel> Yeah shit was rad
[3:28:33] <%bruuzer12> Dogbirds back with a vengeance
[3:28:34] <%Feralspirit41> Ive heard of this
[3:28:35] <Ziegsy> They did it with dogs too, in russia
[3:28:36] <nutimik> they did that with dogs
[3:28:37] <+tempestzephyr> monkey cat!
[3:28:40] <Juanshonium> omg spoiler, a crow with a dog head game ruined
[3:28:41] <GHouseduivel> It was recent in CCP china
[3:28:45] <ElkRiverDog> They did it to dogs too
[3:28:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh hell no
[3:28:47] <+DrFacilier> that shit sounds metal
[3:28:50] <%dds333a> They didn't expect it to live, they just wanted to know
[3:28:51] <tuesti> nope f that
[3:28:51] <KeiganOfAstora> 2020?
[3:28:53] <Wahrow> Reggie's shocked face, haha
[3:28:57] <KeiganOfAstora> 2020 was a cursed year
[3:28:59] <GHouseduivel> It did work, for like 4 hours
[3:29:01] <+StryderStrikesAt> Unholy cursed
[3:29:03] <%polothegreatest> it lived some hours
[3:29:04] <stevenellis386> SCIENCE
[3:29:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> aw those poor monkeys
[3:29:07] <Gelphaze> I remember that shit!
[3:29:11] <+Jiggisnipe> sounds like it worked
[3:29:12] <wibbwobbler> WutFace
[3:29:17] <FrostedZaibatsu> Why did you tell us that
[3:29:17] <Jkhmn12> Science Can be fucked at times
[3:29:17] <drunken_lemur> @GHouseduivel Oh that's soo much worse!
[3:29:18] <nutimik> life is pain, i hate-
[3:29:19] <%polothegreatest> dont forget the doggo too
[3:29:19] <Ziegsy> theres video footage of the dogs. Its HEARTBREAKING
[3:29:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> 4 hours baby. PROGRESS
[3:29:20] <%SirGO0SE> they recorded the same kind of results a long ass time again when the guillotine was in style
[3:29:22] <+StryderStrikesAt> Robocop 2 moment
[3:29:23] <KeiganOfAstora> That's great
[3:29:24] <KeiganOfAstora> PROGRESS
[3:29:27] <%thesw1tch> it's begging for death... WRITE THAT DOWN!
[3:29:32] <andre11dr> Now that's some Bloodborne shit
[3:29:35] <Teradyne87> The Russian experiment decades ago that kept a severed dog's head "alive" and responding to stimulus for minutes on end is nightmare fuel
[3:29:38] <+khalcipher> like the mokey in the fly
[3:29:44] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Lets shoot for 5 next time! Kappa
[3:29:44] <%SirGO0SE> people who were on death row were asked to blink after being beheaded so they could record how long the brain is active without the body
[3:29:47] <%dds333a> Like electrically stimulating a dog head to see if they can keep it alive
[3:29:47] <+tempestzephyr> Edward
[3:29:50] <+Shishi1205> chat are you ready for arcane?
[3:30:05] <KeiganOfAstora> In 2016 itw as done successfully
[3:30:08] <pepinillomaton> Can you imagine if this actually released on PSX back in the day? Best game ever
[3:30:10] <Jkhmn12> That reminds me of the spy cats
[3:30:10] <%Indigo_Automaton> If it's any consolation it was probably still totally dead and the muscles in the eyelids were just contracting from residual electrical activity
[3:30:10] <%atlasdotwav> Can we put an Ethernet on the Nintendo switch? Is that inhumane?
[3:30:11] <+robertoszek> description jumpscare

[3:34:38] <%holydeviant1> Gotta love completely nonsensical mad science
[3:34:51] <+robertoszek> I don't follow what Woolie is implying the game is trying to do, I'm so lost
[3:35:07] <+Shishi1205> chat did you cheese this enemy?
[3:35:10] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> considering the crows bark to begin with, maybe this was meant to be
[3:35:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @robertoszek you'll see
[3:35:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> An enemy absorbed them likely
[3:35:21] <Crownaux0> hunter probably has them
[3:35:23] <+Shishi1205> I abused the fuck out of the ladder cheese
[3:35:33] <%dds333a> Toasty

[3:42:07] <NegaScottsuper> waiting week to catch this stream
[3:42:12] <nutimik> @dds333a not as good as I'd like, but it's too cool not to use every now and then :P
[3:42:19] <%dds333a> Fair LUL
[3:42:32] <+Shishi1205> is it not better to use the tiny tonitrus?
[3:42:53] <%kyh9> 10 minutes to Direct
[3:43:02] <andre11dr> I'll be honest, i never liked this weapon, it think it looks dumb
[3:43:05] <+sixcubit> wait - woolie transformed outside of menu? you can do that?
[3:43:07] <QueequegTheater> @Shishi1205 TIny tonitrus isn't a weapon
[3:43:31] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> static sound of zaps, nice
[3:43:33] <%SirGO0SE> i thought the l1 just electrified it in the og
[3:43:35] <%dds333a> @andre11dr it does. I only like it in concept
[3:43:47] <Nmiser> Is the axe busted good in this version of the game too?
[3:43:52] <QueequegTheater> @SirGO0SE That's correct
[3:43:54] <Monkeyweed21> the best arcane weapons are locked behind the hardest stuff in the dlc
[3:43:54] <%hax_metatron> There are no L1 transforms in this mod. Transforming is via menu
[3:43:55] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Flamesprayer SHREDDS early game if you commit to arcane lmao
[3:44:00] <QueequegTheater> What
[3:44:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> arcane early on is just helping the flamesprayer, definitely a different way to play
[3:44:02] <%dds333a> @nmiser I dont think the axe is here LUL
[3:44:10] <%SirGO0SE> @hax_metatron ahhh i see
[3:44:13] <+Shishi1205> @QueequegTheater yeah but bolt dmg wise I mean

[3:44:19] <QueequegTheater> That's...certainly not from this area
[3:44:22] <%bruuzer12> THAT IS WAY EARLY
[3:44:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> axe is in his inv right now
[3:44:27] <restingbones> hey chat, just got here. will Wollie and Reggie check out the direct when it airs?
[3:44:36] <sirrice77> The axe is from gaskwang in the demake and woolz has it
[3:44:44] <%dds333a> Yeah, you do NOT get that here
[3:44:45] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater Tiny tonitrus uses blood vials
[3:44:48] <Nmiser> @restingbones Said they are going to see how they feel
[3:44:51] <Boegame> woolie so respectful to books
[3:44:52] <linSP> This is the best time to get that shit
[3:44:53] <%dds333a> The Eye I mean

[3:45:06] <%dds333a> @monkeyweed21 Kappa
[3:45:10] <%hax_metatron> No hit it
[3:45:12] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus This area is an excuse for Lilith to put in end game items here so that the demake still has them lol
[3:45:12] <+Shishi1205> @QueequegTheater yeah I remember, but its better than the normal tonitrus is it not?
[3:45:23] <restingbones> @Nmiser alright, thank you theySip
[3:45:24] <Cyan_Dream> did he try swinging?
[3:45:25] <+aWanderingKaivo> tiny tonitrus is a spell
[3:45:26] <QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater No, because it costs consumables
[3:45:37] <ATentacleMonster> man this game FeelsGoodMan
[3:45:39] <Zeikier> uh oh you found the insomniac museum :V
[3:45:41] <+Shishi1205> @QueequegTheater Sure lets leave it at that

[4:11:51] <RyuuAoi> Please let Woolie play what he wants rn guys.
[4:11:52] <@Menitta> Remember they don't care about the direct right now. They're playing Bloodborne.
[4:11:57] <+Aeoneth> @Aeoneth I don't know about that man.  This one might be too weird for even Woolie's love of Kirby to compensate for
[4:12:15] <Boegame> Grant! Us! Eyes! Grant! Us! EYES!
[4:12:17] <%dds333a> Mensis ain't that great about sports, but they have a killer new training program Kappa

[4:13:12] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a did you see they figure out WHAT is dying in that dungeon?
[4:13:15] <penitentpendant> Bloodborne has perhaps one of the more uncomfortable Super Secret boss to fight.
[4:13:22] <+aWanderingKaivo> they have dogbird fighting pits
[4:13:26] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Standing at an interesting grave Kappa
[4:13:26] <andre11dr> You can only play b ball with this sea corpse

[4:16:42] <CappuccinoGuil> @dds333a there's a hunter on a bridge, To save memory, BB turns off meshes that you can't see. The problem is, the hunter is standing near a swinging axe trap. And hitboxes aren't turned off. But AI and physics are turned off too. So he just keeps getting hit until he dies.
[4:16:44] <%dds333a> @andre11dr nooooo, but I want the reference (yeah, it would make no sense) LUL

[4:20:06] <Boegame> @andre11dr Ds2 at least tried asking interesting questions, like the relationship of memories and character to the space and time of the decaying world
[4:20:08] <Cyan_Dream> The funny thing about orphans is they ain't got no parents

[4:23:46] <+Jiggisnipe> naw
[4:23:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> the false hope
[4:24:01] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> issue with a lot of DS discourse is that its harder to go back to older ones the further jn you get
[4:24:01] <+Jiggisnipe> ^
[4:24:07] <%atlasdotwav> thats such a funny death message
[4:24:19] <VirkaLlon> that's so Dark Souls tho LUL
[4:24:29] <Boegame> @andre11dr I would probably put BB at first, but I can't play it consistently (no console) so I only played through it once. So DS2 takes that spot for being on the opposite spectrum, slow, tactical and tense x3
[4:24:32] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> heck, even DS1 feels too clunky for me after BB1 and Ds3, and thats the ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô to most
[4:24:58] <andre11dr> But if we consider story and lore it would go BB>DS1>DES>DS2>DS3
[4:25:01] <%dds333a> There could always be "more action" Kappa
[4:25:13] <letshavecakes> wait did woolie not check the door
[4:25:14] <Boegame> Yarhnam needs some body clean up crew :V
[4:25:19] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Only after touching the gate and lighting the next lamp will the action appear Kappa
[4:25:28] <%dds333a> Hunters prefer to do their embalming on the spot Kappa
[4:25:48] <+Shishi1205> regretably your set up wont work here
[4:25:51] <%dds333a> and some Hunters have other thoughts on that very same matter LUL
[4:25:56] <andre11dr> DS3 to me is like, hei that guy looks cool ,just don't ask questions, just appreciate that he looks cool LUL
[4:25:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Sadly/fortunately the demake doesnt have the "red ribbon"
[4:26:02] <+patriotrenegade> The rent in Yharnam is insane

[4:38:13] <%Indigo_Automaton> Winter Lanterns
[4:38:24] <%dds333a> Like Bloodlickers
[4:38:30] <andre11dr> WINTER LANTERN
[4:38:33] <Boegame> @dds333a If it wasn't called FRENZY it wouldn't be themed at all :V
[4:38:46] <%Indigo_Automaton> Frenzy Fucker Kreygasm
[4:38:50] <Jontman42> just don't panic
[4:38:57] <+patriotrenegade> you cant fight the power
[4:38:59] <%atlasdotwav> @Boegame it is called frenzy tho
[4:39:04] <+karldeck> Back from the direct
[4:39:04] <BlackermanZX> the lantern shows you a live action Ed pic
[4:39:07] <andre11dr> He fucks you into frenzy
[4:39:12] <+Shishi1205> you're right they dont care
[4:39:16] <+robertoszek> can you knock them back with the double barrel shotgun?
[4:39:16] <Boegame> @atlasdotwav yeah, but its just bleed :V
[4:39:20] <Insectorbass> @BlackermanZX Dude.
[4:39:22] <andre11dr> Or she i should say
[4:39:22] <+swesterly> hmmmmm you hit it but the life bar just said ?????
[4:39:23] <+Shishi1205> They are not an enemy you can kill
[4:39:25] <Jontman42> ohhh nnnnnooooooooooooooooo
[4:39:26] <%dds333a> @boegame and thus, because it is, it's thematically appropriate LUL
[4:39:26] <AngryAsian5> YOU THOUGHT
[4:39:27] <+patriotrenegade> its life bar is so huge that its functionally unkillable @WoolieVersus
[4:39:28] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:39:29] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus their an obstacle in demake, cant die

[4:39:32] <DXLelouch24> GOOD LUCK
[4:39:32] <%Tearonex> YOU THOUGHT
[4:39:34] <Carlioo> "oh no"
[4:39:36] <Boegame> I would rather have like 200 more crazed hunters than these guys, would be more thematically appropriate
[4:39:36] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus To reiterate. In the demake the Winter Lantern is nearly impossible to kill due to its outrageous health pool nor can its grab be dodged.  LUL

[4:40:11] <Insectorbass> They've literally turned the enemy into an environmental hazard
[4:40:15] <Boegame> @Boegame The mechanics could be more interesting, is my point
[4:40:18] <TheRealGreaterGamer> ITS A HORROR GAME NOW
[4:40:22] <+swesterly> @Boegame 4Head
[4:40:27] <%Indigo_Automaton> That's such a wild choice but I like it
[4:40:31] <Boegame> @Boegame Conveying the theme through mechanics is more interesting x3
[4:40:34] <+patriotrenegade> Mr X
[4:40:39] <penitentpendant> Goin' Give It To YA
[4:40:44] <Insectorbass> Nah MR X can be downed.
[4:40:52] <+Ryaotz> sneaky time?
[4:40:53] <+robertoszek> but can you knock them back with the double barrel shotgun? or nah
[4:41:01] <stevenellis386> because you cant do nuthin about it
[4:41:06] <%dds333a> @boegame not at all, it's creative. whether a single WL, or an army of Maddened Hunters, both are fantastic, but the WL is all the more interesting
[4:41:08] <+Shishi1205> book it
[4:41:20] <+Shishi1205> checkyour keys

[4:44:14] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus So this is also why doing the basement first is best because you can appreciate the state change of it later.
[4:44:14] <BlackermanZX> LA LA LAAA
[4:44:16] <%Feralspirit41> Youve dealt with the old bullshit but are you ready for the NEW BULLSHIT
[4:44:25] <%Indigo_Automaton> This is actually a great addition to Bloodborne
[4:44:29] <%dds333a> @boegame both are great, but that and the WL are both ways of showcasing theme through mechanics, just like other examples, like the Old Yharnam beasts shying away from light

[4:44:44] <Carlioo> SURVIVIAL. HORROR.
[4:44:51] <stevenellis386> Thats the most intersting thing about eldritch horror. Just knowing about this strange phenomenon in any sense makes you vulnerable.

[4:44:56] <%Feralspirit41> The game has officially changed
[4:44:59] <Insectorbass> This is just straight horror
[4:44:59] <%Indigo_Automaton> If it ever comes to pc I want to see a sequence like this modded into the full game
[4:45:04] <Insectorbass> There's no fight
[4:45:05] <wibbwobbler> New content is pretty baller
[4:45:06] <penitentpendant> A hunter... MUST BE HUNTED
[4:45:16] <%TacoFunBox> Keep on keeping on Woolz! This game looks pretty fun to play.
[4:45:21] <0rnan> I like these lanterns better. Big spooky.
[4:45:26] <+meteor530> Goood Hunter....embrace the frenzy
[4:45:47] <andre11dr> Honestly while it is interesting and makes it more into a horror game, i fucking hate these things and the decision to make them invincible is a questionable one
[4:45:50] <%dds333a> fighting Clifford
[4:45:56] <%atlasdotwav> a whatwolf
[4:45:58] <Boegame> @dds333a It would be cooler if it did something else, messed with the world or the character, maybe some of that ED sanity effects.

[4:47:12] <%dds333a> @boegame I think this is definitely enough, but that would be neat. but it's default effect us just so impactful and visceral, and makes the you-know-what even cooler (the big one)
[4:47:28] <Insectorbass> Don't hate me cause you aint me.
[4:47:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ooooOOOOOOoo

[5:01:45] <+vaderxyz1970> Lived to see everyone die
[5:01:54] <Insectorbass> Genuinely wondering how long a life in Yharnam has to be to be considered "Tragic"
[5:02:05] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @Insectorbass 25 years

[5:02:41] <+RowenCleric> I mean yea kinda 25 seconds? part of the point is human life is insignificant compared to the great ones
[5:02:44] <Insectorbass> @AnActualHermitCrab The Player 2 set.

[5:03:19] <BlackermanZX> the true hunter drip
[5:03:20] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Now obviously the entire state of the world has changed. How much of it you want to see is up to you, assuming you want to go through every area again. But there is a new and "correct" area that has opened now that will leads to the credits.
[5:03:32] <penitentpendant> Content +1
[5:03:32] <%dds333a> @andre11dr indeed, but it was always a shitty place to outsiders, and of course, everything underground is still popping LUL
[5:03:56] <+Shishi1205> What happened to our poor friend
[5:04:20] <+Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Did you check the hunter's axe?
[5:04:20] <%dds333a> LUL

[5:04:45] <TheRealGreaterGamer> He forgot the axe LUL
[5:04:48] <TheRealGreaterGamer> WELP
[5:04:57] <+Shishi1205> dont worry cleaver is better
[5:04:59] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Isnt it a strength weapon too? lol
[5:04:59] <+„Çª„Éì„Éº> raid raid raid
[5:05:01] <+Shishi1205> Sadge
[5:05:04] <andre11dr> And before the Victorian stuff, Yharnam was all knights in armour and shit ,you see some of them in the Chalice Dungeons
[5:05:11] <GHouseduivel> Eh Gascony let me AXE you somethin
[5:05:12] <+vaderxyz1970> egg on face
[5:05:25] <Juanshonium> load save!
[5:05:39] <%dds333a> @andre11dr indeed LUL
[5:05:43] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus yeah, you can load save if youd rather level the axe up!!!
[5:05:51] <%dds333a> There were two raids LUL
[5:06:56] <%dds333a> yeah, don't worry about it
[5:06:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:06:56] <kes009900> every time woolie pauses after saying "we are..." i go VR. this happens often.
[5:07:11] <%dds333a> @kes009900 LUL LUL
[5:07:18] <%Tearonex> SPIN TO WIN
[5:07:18] <%dds333a> LENGTH
[5:07:21] <Zeikier> S p e e d
[5:07:26] <%dds333a> justice
[5:07:26] <Boegame> no kirkhammer tho, sadge ;w;
[5:07:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> speeen
[5:07:37] <andre11dr> SPIN TO WIN BABY
[5:07:40] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Want to save scum and upgrade that instead of cleaver?
[5:07:40] <+swesterly> the best move is the locked on dodge forward thrust
[5:07:41] <Boegame> was my favorite weapon for a lot of the game
[5:07:45] <%dds333a> That's the move
[5:08:03] <Zeikier> I wanted to do the rolling thunder
[5:08:15] <%dds333a> @swesterly that poke is a godsend yeah
[5:08:20] <Insectorbass> hunters axe is the best all-round weapon.
[5:08:23] <TheRealGreaterGamer> You'd have to save scum if you wanted it to plus 5
[5:08:23] <kes009900> axe is bad in this, due to collision
[5:08:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> I forget what it was specifically but you can get a nice 3 hit vertical/thrust chain with the transformed axe
[5:08:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> using that dodge attack and like an L2 and an R1 or something
[5:08:49] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus You did save right before upgrading cleaver
[5:09:20] <andre11dr> @awanderingkaivo Bro ,L2 moves the camera LUL
[5:09:31] <+KBGuilty> You have to ht them Woolie
[5:09:31] <TheRealGreaterGamer> Unfortunately it isnt big boy damage since it isnt maxed lol
[5:09:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> I'm talking about the "source material"
[5:09:35] <+meteor530> Is 360 attack still there?
[5:09:53] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus Now obviously the entire state of the world has changed. How much of it you want to see is up to you, assuming you want to go through every area again. But there is a new and "correct" area that has opened now that will lead to the credits.
[5:09:53] <Zeikier> I like how Gascoigne was holding onto the axe
[5:09:54] <+Jiggisnipe> blocks
[5:09:56] <%dds333a> @kbguilty LUL *proceeds to spin from a mile away*
[5:10:07] <penitentpendant> Huzzah more content

[5:11:16] <kes009900> how come max covered this game in one stream and woolie's pushing a 3rd one? honest question.

[5:11:34] <+Shishi1205> different paces
[5:11:36] <%atlasdotwav> we lab
[5:11:45] <BlackermanZX> @kes009900 max is a bloodborne freak and also Snailborne
[5:11:46] <+aWanderingKaivo> because woolie prefers to explore and find stuff on his own
[5:11:46] <TheRealGreaterGamer> @WoolieVersus This is why I was suggesting you save scum! LUL
[5:11:58] <andre11dr> Damn ,someone should make a Soulsborne fighting game
[5:12:03] <peachy996> @kes009900 guess Max isn't as much of a fan of BB as Woolie

[6:01:39] <%emptyantics> DQ3 Remake is sexy
[6:01:41] <%dds333a> I need a new strategy RPG to play

[6:01:44] <Aussie_Manny> I never finished Octopath because the final boss marathon sucks.
