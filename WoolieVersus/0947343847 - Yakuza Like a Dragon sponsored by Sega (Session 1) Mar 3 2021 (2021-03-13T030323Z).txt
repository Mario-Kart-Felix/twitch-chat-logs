[0:09:02] <+Mr_Pylon> Light side later
[0:09:03] <BlackermanZX> Big Himbo Hijiyama
[0:09:05] <+Aluminum_Ape> You gotta start with dubs, Woolz
[0:09:06] <missingangle> Hmmm fair!!
[0:09:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's gonna be weeeeird but coolio
[0:09:06] <CureMode_> PRO ZD is also a voice actor in the game
[0:09:07] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackBofe
[0:09:07] <CappuccinoGuil> Curious to see how you'll swap them. Like, between sessions?
[0:09:08] <Solidnick18> but what goes first SeriousSloth
[0:09:11] <Pookiedaexzile> coin flip
[0:09:11] <Kiryurules> Dub is fantastic so this is good
[0:09:11] <DianaTheAscian> how frequent is this alternation?
[0:09:13] <+thesickestzak> MY YAKISOBA PAN
[0:09:13] <+AkronymCLT> I played Japanese so I'm interested to hear the differences
[0:09:14] <TigerClaws12> >telling a weeb to put dub on
[0:09:14] <@Menitta> good solution for how split that poll was
[0:09:19] <%JustToWatch> Start with the dub for George Takei though
[0:09:20] <Darren716> The Dub is legit better
[0:09:22] <+Psitterrific> Yakuza 7, without spoilers feels like a loveletter to jrpgs, yakuza style. I genuinely love it.
[0:09:22] <Asuterisuku> Pat's described that to him as well.
[0:09:25] <brachydios777> It will be established that Ichi does know what sex is
[0:09:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Nah Sub is way better
[0:09:29] <majindusto> Playing a Yakuza game Dubbed enigmaCringe
[0:09:33] <PsychoPearl> Start with dub I suggest
[0:09:33] <%SpcOpsBear> I'm getting a honey BBQ supermelt from Friendly's and can't decide what to drink
[0:09:39] <%ggbhtg> acquire funds
[0:09:39] <missingangle> Do you know how many sessions you’ll be playing Y7?
[0:09:40] <%X2Eliah> Yakisoba like a dragon.
[0:09:43] <tuftecake> thank goodness dubz
[0:09:43] <@akuda_bar> free drinks? free drinks? can't say no to free drinks
[0:09:43] <TigerClaws12> now where's the actual poll? Put it up coward Kappa
[0:09:46] <%Exiliator> Yeah
[0:09:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Like a Pockets
[0:09:46] <+RazeEmAll> the dub is real good
[0:09:47] <%SpcOpsBear> Lemonade or iced tea?
[0:09:48] <PsychoPearl> I prefer sub but I like dub
[0:09:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> SEGA be like 👀
[0:09:52] <Darren716> Start with the dub so you get Takai and Wei Shen
[0:09:52] <%chosenjuan42> WE ALL OK
[0:09:54] <bitterpelican> Both dub and sub are cool, but dub is just easier for English speakers to get it on the ear
[0:09:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> We worry
[0:09:57] <@Menitta> This is great
[0:09:58] <%itschickenscratch> if you ever get the chance to sell out, sell the fuck out
[0:09:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> the call-out
[0:09:58] <VidulaSaix> PEOPLE ARENT OKAY WITH SEASON 4?

[0:34:47] <NoireRequiem> jelly donut
[0:34:52] <Carlioo> no
[0:34:53] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus no\
[0:34:53] <%shad8snake> no
[0:34:54] <ALTRNico> no one turn at a time
[0:34:54] <%Juriasu> no item takes a turn normally
[0:34:55] <%psidefx> nah
[0:34:55] <SomeOtherNeb> no, it's just tutorial things
[0:34:55] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Dapper_Cactuar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Yakuza now with more George Takei
[0:34:56] <tuftecake> just tutorial
[0:34:56] <+lordericter> nah its tutorial
[0:34:56] <CappuccinoGuil> No, one action epr turn
[0:34:57] <Solidnick18> you can perfect guard
[0:34:57] <enerkaizer> No, you have active guard. Think Mario RPG
[0:34:57] <%X2Eliah> no
[0:34:58] <Saltmeisterr> u can't move
[0:34:58] <+Proxzo> Oh man I love salmon onigiri.
[0:35:01] <+eldrinos> turns are being skipped for tutorial
[0:35:03] <%runegod20> just a tutorial, items takes up turns
[0:35:05] <Pookiedaexzile> 1 action and a Movement
[0:35:12] <%aram909> theres a "speed" stat that determines how many actions a character can do during a turn
[0:35:17] <SuperBloodWolfMoon> This is already the best Paper Mario game of the last ten years.
[0:35:24] <JoshManVGH> It's not a full guard action. The response block is like Paper Mario, reduces damage
[0:35:28] <PsychoPearl> It's December 31, 2000 not 1999. Its gonna be 2001
[0:35:32] <Louie_Salmon> @superbloodwolfmoon It hurts but it's true
[0:35:36] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> If only they had the Stylish moves from Paper Mario
[0:35:38] <+Chronobot> _ _ G A system
[0:35:42] <%Juriasu> @JoshManVGH but there is also a guard action
[0:35:43] <%aram909> characters with high speed can do multiple actions per turn
[0:35:43] <YellowJacketKaraguchi> I love that the combat menu is SEGA
[0:35:44] <+FreshlyGratedGinger> paper mario lmal
[0:35:44] <%runegod20> also, I think this is a game where the higher a character's agility is, on top of being higher in the turn order, they also gain turns faster
[0:35:46] <krabsan> @WoolieVersus you could do 2 actions before him cause of your speed
[0:35:46] <%Exiliator> Cool!...?
[0:35:48] <ricky12k1> Wasn’t expecting him to jump to 7

[1:32:16] <SixthShinx> D:
[1:32:20] <%krispen_wa> Masato totally deserved it to be fair
[1:32:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Masato learns that MONEY DOESNT WIN
[1:32:21] <ulcaban> Three sea shells

[1:33:11] <DSD24> The loading is goon on PS4 too

[1:34:52] <Orenjevel> THE TRIPLETS
[1:34:54] <+Yakfan> if you go in to the settings you can turn off the button prompts for everything but defensive moves and you still get all the bonuses as if you hit them perfectly
[1:34:55] <DSD24> Not for the player character which is important
[1:34:58] <+nomad390> Yeah it goes from 60fps to 30fps
[1:35:00] <+eldrinos> big difference here is that physics are more accurate and raytracing are added in in HR
[1:35:00] <Klefth> To think of how easy it is to run this game in 4k on PC, and the PS5 chugs this bad? Jesus...
[1:35:01] <ErazorD_Jim20XX> YOU'RE CLOSE, MA'AM

[2:00:08] <%gatorafan> @dzyz_ just a small detour for SEGA money
[2:00:08] <%krispen_wa> The implication is real. he did John Wick them
[2:00:11] <+Shonen_hero> let's be fair, the map in this game is relatively small for an open world game. That gives them the edge though because they can fill that city with a ton of content

[2:00:11] <Dakuu75> "heavy coffee" sounds like something I wouldn't wanna have unless I was 10 feet away from a toilet

[2:21:48] <neptious> SHAKEDOWN-ISH MUSIC
[2:21:49] <%Noonoox12> @WoolieVersus basic attacks can be blocked. Specials can't
[2:21:49] <CelestialCage> Skills bypass blocks
[2:21:51] <zerointelligence000> blocking only works on basic attacks
[2:21:52] <morningmoondude> Regular attacks can be blocked, not skills
[2:21:54] <Darren716> Special attacks can usually hit whoever, regular attacks can be blocked though
[2:21:55] <+ChubbyPencil> Skills don't get interrupted
[2:21:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bike, Old Faithful
[2:21:58] <+eldrinos> in general special attacks can't be bodyblocked on startup
[2:21:58] <xdeathknightx> no only regular attacks can get blocked
[2:22:00] <Lizard0TM> God the music is so good in this game
[2:22:01] <+MajorCrasher> skills can't be blocked
[2:22:01] <+Yakfan> @WoolieVersus now it's a random roll when you go past someone if they're gonna attack
[2:22:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's just sometimes characters will take a swing if your running to someone behind them
[2:22:03] <pi_in_the_sci> attacks provoke AoOs, skills always work
[2:22:06] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Special moves allow u to run past enemies so they don't hit u
[2:22:10] <+Chronobot> INCONSPICOUS
[2:22:16] <%runegod20> special attacks can't be blocked, but they also don't have the bonus damage from hitting a downed enemy
[2:22:17] <+Shonen_hero> they are pretty snappy
[2:22:22] <%osaka_daioh> yeah its great
[2:22:23] <+Freakin_Wolfy> I just got back. Did they just pause the game for an hour?
[2:22:25] <R3c0n31> so you gotta plan out your attacks using the characters movement
[2:22:31] <+Nekros4442> overall these fights are way faster
[2:22:33] <Blank9> hp/mp comes back on level up, spend away
[2:22:36] <BurdRightsActivist> FF13 PogChamp

[2:22:42] <%krispen_wa> @freakin_wolfy they got in to cutscenes for an hour
[2:22:42] <%Javaa01> Every time you go up a character or job level you get a HP and MP refill
[2:22:45] <%AllenDeadman> 1 Int
[2:22:48] <%KenReels> every level up you refresh MP
[2:22:49] <DSD24> That's Ichiban for you!

[2:23:03] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus regular attacks can be stopped by "Attack Of Opportunity" type attacks of enemies between you and your target. Skills ignore that "Attack of Opportunity" thing
[2:23:04] <OkamiDude15> ichiban is the sharpest tool in the shed, but he's got a good heart
[2:23:06] <MyNameIsRasus> It's a shame Woolie hasn't played 1 to see the parallel

[2:27:44] <%BusterRepukken> This chat sucks lmao.
[2:27:46] <Jonxal> He'd be dead if it wasn't for Arakawa. Paying 10 or 20 years to stay alive when you were supposed to be dead is pretty good deal imo
[2:27:47] <%TheMoenia> nah you need a bad cop
[2:27:47] <%Exiliator> Would look bad
[2:27:47] <+Shonen_hero> You can find a better man to crack the whip

[2:27:54] <BurdRightsActivist> @BusterRepukken No, You :)
[2:27:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Woolie miss the part where letting Jo take the fall would get their clan wiped out because yakuza politics?
[2:27:58] <TheNeonCaster> Wait, this is ProZD? Oh dip!!!!
[2:27:59] <jowi_time> the problem is the power vacuum
[2:27:59] <+Nekros4442> Nope. If Jo takes the fall the entire Arakawa goes down with him.
[2:28:00] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s the captain though, if he admitted to it the whole family would have to pay
[2:28:02] <Neoripo> Sacrifice Jo for profit
[2:28:02] <+MightyDuckShoes> @BusterRepukken Seriously.
[2:28:03] <R3c0n31> Happy Birthday ichi, Go to prison for a jackass

[2:37:00] <+valiard> Ichiban - New Century - Luck=0
[2:37:01] <NotHereToStream> 99%
[2:37:01] <Asuterisuku> But this is Japan, where if it goes to trial, you're Guilty.

[2:37:03] <Jalexster> I think boss probably gave you enough details
[2:37:03] <+Das_Prints> I forget how old was Ichi at this point? Was it 22?
[2:37:08] <%neroforte177> or in certain countries he'd be fucking dead
[2:37:08] <laserbeaming> Japan just likes to put people in jail
[2:37:08] <linSP> Everyone knows you’re not guilty but go to jail
[2:37:10] <NeonBleu> 99.9%

[2:37:46] <+chiazam> Yeah people confess to crimes they didn't do A LOT in the US

[2:47:11] <morningmoondude> God, yeah, Adachi would totally be in Tekken
[2:47:12] <+Yakfan> The dub is so good they haven't even entertained the idea of switching languages
[2:47:13] <BlackermanZX> Absolutely a tekken vibe
[2:47:15] <HollowMan190> Yakiza is just tekken with a story mode
[2:47:19] <Who_lio42> shitty old man lei
[2:47:21] <jasonisgold79> So basically, during Yakuza 1-6, this guy was in jail for all of that. So he's a Boomer Himbo.
[2:47:24] <Karego_at> when we switching to sub
[2:47:30] <%awpickens> BOOMBER HIMBO
[2:47:38] <Kiryurules> @Karego_at hopefully never :D

[2:48:04] <$J33P3R5_CR33P3R> Kiryu would turn away
[2:48:06] <+vaderxyz1970> Prison preserves you
[2:48:08] <pricklypissant> Kiryu got super weak after being in prison
[2:48:09] <Dakuu75> decaying-stats, OH NOOOOO lol don't say that!!!
[2:48:09] <ARDM112> You lose stats in jail in Elder Scrolls so it's probably like that LUL
[2:48:13] <zedravan> Negative INT
[2:48:14] <+BatGuano114> so the English VA for Adachi also voiced Ryusuke Kido in Judgment
[2:48:16] <uncledoodsauce> fyre fest happened while in prison
[2:48:17] <+Cuon_Alpinus> https://clips.twitch.tv/SparklingThirstyPoxCorgiDerp-ba1pZy_4FlVthr-E

[2:49:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ichi is gonna flip when he sees how many Dragon Quests are out now
[2:49:11] <ghoststalker> Dub is good, but there are certain scenes where the sub is a lot better
[2:49:14] <madtrixr> @johnnychopsocky he made a tweet sweating his balls off about it, hes real nervous
[2:49:16] <%Livelinne> Akioooo shiaLove
[2:49:19] <ulcaban> Adachi's alignment is Sleazy Good
[2:49:22] <huskarl_zap> BREAD

[3:04:45] <DedlokPM> @RyuuAoi There really isn't anything spoilery in the first 13 hours. Like, Tojo is gone but not due to anyhing directly related to what happens in the rest of 0 and 1-6. Besides he his making some monry off this.
[3:04:47] <+McSoliace> ichiban's in big denial
[3:04:48] <CelestialCage> MODERN

[3:06:55] <+Shonen_hero> okay, the vape you're talking about isn't nicotine infused water. It's thc oil and that's what was fucking up kids. The coil was releasing some chemical when burned and the oil stuck to your lungs. Speaking from firsthand experience

[3:09:16] <+combat_rock> Turns out man CAN live on bread alone.
[3:09:19] <%invader_rin> Close your heart to it
[3:09:21] <Komayeda> So like, is this as far as he's goin' so far?
[3:09:21] <%awpickens> V has not
[3:09:22] <pi_in_the_sci> Alternate?
[3:09:24] <+NopeBadguy> Let that hype propel you through the rest of the series
[3:09:25] <@Menitta> V is only up to Yakuza 4
[3:09:27] <ghoststalker> @torgue_1 no, he hasn’t
[3:09:27] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @torgue_1 nope they’re both goin in blind
[3:09:28] <TundraOW> How does it feel knowing you'll never taste Kasuga's physics-enabled bread?
[3:09:29] <Lizard0TM> build up the walls, keep them high
[3:09:32] <+FuqBoiSlim> Can we get slow mode off now
[3:09:35] <%SilverDevilfish> Woolie will finish 0, get 2 hours into Kiwami and be like "let's go back to 7"
[3:09:39] <xdeathknightx> @Torgue_1 No, he hasn't
[3:09:39] <Pookiedaexzile> How ya likin Ichi
[3:09:48] <thekorvu> Bruh wut?

[3:09:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> Serious Crime Drama remember? Kappa

[3:09:53] <%Exiliator> CHOTTO MATTE
[3:09:54] <@Menitta> Arakawa's backstory is the darkest in probably the entire series
[3:09:54] <$emptyantics> Cheer500 FULL LP COMFIRMED?!
[3:09:54] <+SilverInferno3> But can that bread run Arkham Asylum?
[3:09:54] <+rrratbastard> best backstory best protag dont fight me on this
[3:09:55] <spiderously> and how about that dub
[3:09:56] <R3c0n31> The back and forth of Intense and funny is handled so well
[3:09:58] <Afrosamasenpai> CH-CHOTTO
[3:09:59] <Solidnick18> Kudastop
[3:09:59] <%bread_assassin> It's gonna be hard when Woolie switches back and has to wait a couple years to beat 1-6 before he can come play the rest.
[3:10:01] <%BusterRepukken> @Livelinne who is John
[3:10:01] <daniphofani> CHOTTO MATTE
[3:10:03] <yssarilrock> Yakuza 4 has the best pre-Ichi PC: Shun Akiyama
[3:10:09] <%Noonoox12> Are we stopping for today, or just pausing?
[3:10:16] <+eldrinos> yeah this game takes a lot of notes from persona 5 in terms of QOL
[3:10:16] <cumurasame> I love Kiryu but Ichiban is soooo good at expressing himself
[3:10:16] <+ConLin_Arts_> Ichibans tits in the reflection
[3:10:17] <Astrophizz> same as dragon quest
[3:10:22] <%gatorafan> QoL Kreygasm
[3:10:26] <%runegod20> i never like using auto heal items, I want to choose what healing items get used manually rather than it being random

[3:10:31] <+rusttyphoon> Chotto a minute

[3:11:02] <Tardispardis> Change to sub next week?
[3:11:05] <Kiryurules> HE IS A GOOD BOY
[3:11:05] <TheCrispyBoi> he da best]
[3:11:05] <@Menitta> @runegod20 In Y7, it uses your party's healing moves and it prioritizes any party member not in your current crew
[3:11:06] <prime_name> Characters make or break a story
[3:11:08] <@Menitta> Its pretty nice
[3:11:10] <+MidnightBurst12> the real horseporn experience
[3:11:10] <+Shonen_hero> Ichiban is seriously a good follow up to Kiryu.
[3:11:17] <+McSoliace> there are so many likeable characters in this game
[3:11:19] <PsychoPearl> Gonna check sub for next stream?
[3:11:25] <+NopeBadguy> One of my favorite things I've heard is that Yakuza is like the Sopranos occasionally punctuated by an episode of the Simpsons.
[3:11:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theyre alternating subs and dubs
[3:11:32] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s way more proactive than reactive
[3:11:34] <Karego_at> sub next time ?
[3:11:39] <%Double_Tap_That> OH BOY is there racing
[3:11:42] <fIashman92> Kiryu is a force of nature
[3:11:44] <%X2Eliah> Racing, you say?
[3:11:45] <xdeathknightx> BEWARE, the auto heal will use items and will decide for itself which items it deems best to use
[3:11:54] <justcallmebobplease> Woolie, how you like Mario Kart?
[3:11:54] <Darren716> Man I hope Woolie plays enough to get to the kart

[3:11:56] <R3c0n31> Ichis ghost is hovering over V with intensity
[3:12:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Ichi Matches the world
[3:12:05] <Komayeda> I mean, Ichiban's also kinda that way in substories, but he's got lotsa initiative in the main story
[3:12:06] <Djinnazz> He'd have been one of the grunts Kiryu would beat up on.
[3:12:14] <%kullumanati> I’m so glad they dubbed it.
[3:12:15] <%BusterRepukken> @Livelinne ah so hes just a mad kiryu fanboy
[3:12:16] <cumurasame> @yssarilrock I'd say Shinada Tatsuo is more of the proto Ichiban
[3:12:17] <PrideOfFiddles> Really, really looking forward to the next stream :D
[3:12:22] <%Mattais88> How bout that dub Ichi, too?
[3:12:23] <@Menitta> Ichiban has a big "Sir, this is a Wendy's" vibe

[3:12:31] <Asuterisuku> 3 hours and we don't even have our first party member yet.

[3:12:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> just put chat into emote only mode during next stream
[3:12:50] <passserby> can't wait for the english karaoke
[3:12:51] <%wibbwobbler> this is pretty lit so far !
[3:12:51] <Afrosamasenpai> You mean hammers aren't subtle?
[3:12:51] <@Menitta> Maybe baby jail next time
[3:12:51] <%jonblnt> Such a good dub
[3:12:52] <+HolePunchLeaf> "Wow, I can't wait for this next part,, RIGHT GUYS???" :^)
[3:12:58] <RyuuAoi> Stop. You're not cool
[3:13:04] <%ggbhtg> but if I joke about an incoming spoiler, you won't get it!!!!!!! FailFish
[3:13:05] <Klefth> I honestly prefer dub Kasuga over JP Kasuga
[3:13:07] <BabblingBayou> That dub is pretty good ngl
[3:13:08] <%Exiliator> It's "alright", but I don't see the "AMAZING" so far
[3:13:10] <jorniev> CHAT BE LIKE: better not get used to him huehuehuehuehahahaagh-
[3:13:13] <%MaddyCaddy> I played this on sub and I'm pretty sure the translation is different from the dub which is pretty neat
[3:13:19] <DedlokPM> @runegod20 once you have heal skills it will auto-use them. Eventually you will have enough stats and mp where the auto-heal stuff will not be taxing at all.
[3:13:20] <PsychoPearl> Will you do the sub for next stream?
[3:13:21] <Tardispardis> It's just ok so far imo
[3:13:21] <Clundy> The dub is surprisingly A+
[3:13:24] <%gatorafan> That lipsync tho, I love to see it!
[3:13:37] <%Mrbaconator> george takei FUCKIN KILLS IT
[3:13:41] <PortableBoredom> Did bread happen
[3:13:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:13:55] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I think that be good to switch every session
[3:13:58] <%notsoy> they specifically re-did the lip sync for the english audio and it fucking rocks
[3:14:01] <ghoststalker> Yeah, the dub cast was very good
[3:14:04] <Darren716> Next session is fine in Japanese, we got to hear the two characters I wanted you to hear in English
[3:14:05] <@Menitta> Judgment had that problem too. I'm glad they were able to lip sync this one for dub
[3:14:09] <NotHereToStream> ff7r had lipsync tech
[3:14:10] <@Solidus_113> Sync AI
[3:14:11] <%Double_Tap_That> @PortableBoredom Yes
[3:14:12] <Jnkolm> That was Judgement's issue. lipsynch was way off
[3:14:18] <fIashman92> Don't forget the amazing DOUBLE translated subtitles
[3:14:23] <fritz_dacat> woolieMIRINperfect
[3:14:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Forbidden Bread Tech
[3:14:29] <@Menitta> It was only for pre rendered cutscenes but man it was jarring
[3:14:31] <Prevot> english speakers are super spoiled with this lip sync shit, no place in the world gets things lyp synced in their dubs
[3:14:41] <Solidnick18> They got that shit on lock
[3:14:42] <Kyoshikei> Did someone clip the bread tech?
[3:14:43] <frostyjay3> the BREAD PULL
[3:14:49] <Ner234> Bangers SourPls
[3:14:50] <VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus The Sub in this game also has a slightly different script as well. Some of the lines are just outright different. Check out the beginning on Youtube in JP if you wanna see what I mean
[3:14:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Just throwing it out there - Like A Dragon is on sale for Steam on Fanatical for the next 13 or so days.
