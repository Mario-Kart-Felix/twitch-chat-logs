[0:13:22] <%Wool> Same problem with P4U lol
[0:13:24] <+Rykorr> the thing about umineko is that it's so dense that spoilers just make things more confusing
[0:13:25] <%pectusumbra> think of them as novels rather than games
[0:13:32] <+0range_Boy> Umineko got properly translated and release as of year or so ago
[0:13:41] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Solidnick18! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel!
[0:13:41] <+0range_Boy> Well 2 years
[0:13:42] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat!
[0:13:46] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus We know how to play
[0:13:46] <Broand> What do you say to Terrys chocolate orange?
[0:13:50] <SpookySpaghooti> Imagine doing a DHC in Monopoly
[0:13:50] <%The_Timo> Monopoly is garbage and boring lol
[0:13:50] <+jiggy_snipe> has anyone actually finished a game of Monopoly?
[0:13:52] <Tuna_Can_0> what if you play monopoly in a sauna?
[0:14:02] <%ECRead> Monopoly is like C Tier
[0:14:02] <+captain_history> Umineko ended like 9 years ago
[0:14:03] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus We know how to play, so it's hella competitive
[0:14:09] <+0range_Boy> Also remember, Umineko is a murder mystery
[0:14:16] <TheGershon> The reason why Monopoly sucks is that everyone ignores the rules and plays unlimited rounds
[0:14:18] <FrostedZaibatsu> Monopoly "family friendly" well not my family
[0:14:19] <%SirGO0SE> most parker bros games are just dated / been done better
[0:14:23] <+0range_Boy> That's the genre where spoilers are literally the worst
[0:14:23] <+Rykorr> the only spoilers in golden fantasia are in visual references to the VN
[0:14:23] <Man_in_the_Red> Monopoly is designed to be unfun so i guess it suceeded
[0:14:26] <%Solidnick18> thanks @blaccbird914 for the gift sub
[0:14:27] <%ggbhtg> We definitely got tier lists for each properties @WoolieVersus

[1:00:40] <%ReiDuran> @WoolieVersus it's "Ronald" backwards because Ronald A. Knox. It's a mystery novel reference
[1:00:40] <devanmuse> Ronald Knox versus Van Dyne
[1:00:40] <iamtheTwitchghost> willard Kreygasm
[1:00:42] <alephalpha> she is a respresentaion oif the knox decalogue

[1:00:49] <UltimateDomon> Whens Golden Nocturne
[1:00:50] <+Blokehat> People think it's weeb when it's actually westaboo af
[1:00:51] <Broand> Knox is a reference to a mystery novel writer

[1:01:44] <RunoEddie> Umineko is like, 5 steps below Danganronpa in weeabooness, and that's way more popular nowadays
[1:01:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:01:45] <blue6sub6remnant6> Knox's fifth is "the answer is not flagrant racism."

[1:01:54] <+nelsonjaydee> I don't remember a thing from this game other than what happens in the first 4 episodes.
[1:01:54] <alephalpha> that sheild makes her unzonable
[1:02:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @karmahoudini_guitar

[1:03:16] <RunoEddie> oh, that's why then, I'm still at the start of 5
[1:03:20] <+Sirtoastman> Furfur and Zepar are on the network menu
[1:03:21] <alephalpha> lion's boy toy?
[1:03:27] <%ReiDuran> A lot of people seem to not like him but Willard and Lion made a good pair
[1:03:30] <+zetastriker> The Answer arcs have a lot of new characters
[1:03:30] <+karmahoudini_guitar> 5 and 6 are the best games in the series
[1:03:37] <tearfuldevil> are kanon and dlanor using the same sort of wepaon?
[1:03:50] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Dlanor is using a a sword of red truth
[1:03:52] <RunoEddie> @karmahoudini_guitar that's a claim, really?
[1:03:53] <blue6sub6remnant6> @tearfuldevil Yes, but also no.
[1:04:01] <tearfuldevil> how helpful LUL
[1:04:05] <RunoEddie> @karmahoudini_guitar because the other episodes were amazing
[1:04:07] <+karmahoudini_guitar> yeah, I personally at the very least, enjoyed 5 and 6 the most
[1:04:08] <%ReiDuran> it's complicated
[1:04:10] <Arnschen> DO THE SUPER WOOLIE
[1:04:23] <alephalpha> WE DERSIRE THE GRETA EQUALISER
[1:04:26] <%ReiDuran> Honestly, the end of 4 was probably my favorite
[1:04:29] <Nekros4442> You're definitely gonna want to do the big super with Dlanor ;p
[1:04:30] <+karmahoudini_guitar> the whole thing is great. I still haven't read 8 though. it wasn't translated back when I played the VNs back in 2011
[1:04:32] <%ReiDuran> because of that showdown
[1:04:39] <realestjojo> end of 4 was real strong yeah
[1:04:42] <+karmahoudini_guitar> I will re-read the whole thing on Steam, though
[1:04:45] <%ReiDuran> the end of 6 is a very close second

[1:10:17] <floralkami> is Beatrice throwing mini Lucifer's?
[1:10:29] <realestjojo> just also realized we have team ep 3 vs team ep 5 and 6
[1:10:31] <Nekros4442> nah, Beatrice is legit throwing Lucifer
[1:10:34] <Nekros4442> Beatrice owns her
[1:10:36] <alephalpha> no lucifer and the other 6 sisters
[1:10:41] <tearfuldevil> @Lordbahamut780 i think so, and theyll be doing play iwth viewers using parsec
[1:10:41] <%pectusumbra> @floralkami there are seven sisters, Beatrice controls them all. Lucifer is the oldest
[1:10:49] <%pectusumbra> they exist as stakes
[1:10:55] <%wicketpelican> The people in this game are so LOUD! They need to stfu
[1:11:14] <%pectusumbra> oh yeah, no black holes from 34 yet
[1:11:16] <floralkami> scottfOhno
[1:11:18] <tearfuldevil> @pectusumbra as in, wooden stakes?
[1:11:25] <make_eye> gooood
[1:11:29] <Nekros4442> Woolie, You have no fucking idea about the smugness in this series
[1:11:29] <%ReiDuran> Beato is MAX SMUG
[1:11:33] <Starotter70> The SMUGGEST
[1:11:38] <Lordbahamut780> Ok cause I'm definitely loving this
[1:11:41] <chhdez> Beato's the best
[1:11:47] <%pectusumbra> @tearfuldevil think ritual weapons. like ice picks for human sacrifice
[1:11:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> so this using parsec or what
[1:11:58] <gordieda20> Everybody is a smug asshole in the game LUL
[1:11:59] <Arnschen> IT'S PERFECTO
[1:12:03] <whiteblacklight74> paafekto
[1:12:04] <townzzzzz> you gotta cash out your meter
[1:12:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> they're gonna use parsec later

[1:12:06] <%ReiDuran> IT'S PAAFEKTO
[1:12:09] <Thunderhog> @CaptainPileDriver Yeah, they're doing parsec later
[1:12:09] <+Blokehat> 2 meter ain't it
[1:12:12] <%Meekest> PAAAFECKTO
[1:12:12] <make_eye> @CaptainPileDriver they will when they do online
[1:12:18] <hiroy_raind> 1 meter to start, 2 meter to counter
[1:12:18] <tearfuldevil> @CaptainPileDriver woolies planning on using aprsec, although apperently the game has rollback
[1:12:20] <e1io> so this online is parsec?
[1:12:23] <Elsewize> Who's gonna tell them about the counter activation?
[1:12:29] <%Livelinne> shiaS
[1:12:30] <make_eye> INGOT ROOM
[1:12:34] <make_eye> almosst
[1:12:35] <%Livelinne> shiaS shiaS shiaS
[1:12:38] <whiteblacklight74> they found out at the start
[1:12:42] <iamtheTwitchghost> @e1io game has rollback

[1:14:36] <tearfuldevil> @WUFFLEBEAM_PRIME i don't really like the designs much, but they've got a pretty good amount of aniamtion on them
[1:14:36] <SpiritOfThuggery> @WUFFLEBEAM_PRIME The sprites themselves are pretty good, the animations can be jank at times.

[1:15:32] <alephalpha> man jessica vs ronove wa shype
[1:15:40] <Mr_Rakjo> BIRB TECH
[1:15:41] <%pectusumbra> aegis woolie
[1:15:50] <OkamiDude15> please look forward to woolie's month long stream where he reads all of umineko live on stream because of jessica doing boxer shit
[1:15:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:15:53] <%pectusumbra> I mean reggie damn
[1:15:55] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @pectusumbra there is NOTHING more homoerotic than trying to murder someone
[1:15:56] <Shardlab> Her bullet punishes all without distinction.
[1:15:58] <dinnydanny777> GivePLZ bird
[1:16:05] <UltimateDomon> Shannon in the club doing aegis reflector
[1:16:07] <%DSD24> How long is Umineko
[1:16:12] <+karmahoudini_guitar> very long
[1:16:14] <gordieda20> Long
[1:16:19] <WG101> JACKPOT
[1:16:20] <make_eye> @DSD24 agonizingly long
[1:16:21] <+zetastriker> It's the longest visual novel I know of
[1:16:21] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Umineko is 8 visual novels
[1:16:22] <%pectusumbra> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug just reminded of an old shit post with jessica and willard looking at Shannon and Lion
[1:16:26] <realestjojo> @dsd24 you know war and peace?
[1:16:27] <Starotter70> But I'm also a slow reader so
[1:16:34] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @okamidude15 a whole month of alternating between umineko and halo novels
[1:16:34] <realestjojo> try 3x the length st least
[1:16:36] <RunoEddie> @DSD24 enourmously long
[1:16:37] <UltimateDomon> It took me around 100 hours to read the whole thing
[1:16:40] <%DSD24> I do know War and Peace @realestjojo
[1:16:51] <hiroy_raind> 8 linear visual novel. You can finish one in a day/half a day
[1:16:52] <%dots4eyes> Oh my eyes have seen the jiggles
[1:16:54] <%pectusumbra> @DSD24 think of it as an 8 book series
[1:16:55] <chhdez> War and cold war
[1:16:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @pectusumbra I've never read umineko this means nothing to me
[1:16:57] <Arnschen> Can be around 60-80 hours
[1:17:01] <%wicketpelican> like wtf they are family or something but girl just brings a gun and shots her sister this is so sad
[1:17:02] <Shardlab> The Bounce is how you know it's ANime
[1:17:02] <alephalpha> 3 war and poeaces put togetehr is shprter than umineko
[1:17:04] <%ReiDuran> So using Rosa is pretty good because she plays keepaway while Jessica builds meter
[1:17:09] <%chll0ne> jiggle? Kreygasm
[1:17:09] <make_eye> it's 100 hrs but there's still more material
[1:17:13] <Arnschen> It is it's own series
[1:17:14] <tearfuldevil> @realestjojo bitch i read Wheel of Time
[1:17:21] <dinnydanny777> She pulled out a dinner kart lmao
[1:17:21] <+Blokehat> I read it over the course of like 2 years
[1:17:23] <chhdez> Not just a family, but a rich family
[1:17:24] <RunoEddie> @wicketpelican no joke, that is nothing
[1:17:24] <alephalpha> it's like 200 hours
[1:17:28] <%wicketpelican> girl with a fuckin gun and dude with a teapot
[1:17:28] <%Superbro64> time to read the manga Kappa
[1:17:34] <realestjojo> then you'll be fine then!
[1:17:35] <+zetastriker> Yo, that was a cool move. Using metaverse to set up a counter. Too bad it didn't work
[1:17:41] <blue6sub6remnant6> So chat, is Shannon stuffing her shirt, or is the viewer/Ballter canonically having delusions about her chest?
[1:17:42] <OkamiDude15> woolie will spend at least 133 hours reading all of umineko
[1:17:43] <make_eye> 200 hrs is more realistic considering all the OTHER material
[1:17:46] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> the virgin umineko vs the chad smash bros brawl fanfic thats the second longest piece of literature known to man
[1:17:48] <%pectusumbra> True, there is a manga, but you would miss out on all the music, but you get awesome art
[1:17:50] <e1io> this is like the bastard child of Jojo, Grim, and Melty Blood all in one
[1:17:51] <Elsewize> Just do it!
[1:17:57] <+captain_history> Umineko is 8-10 hours per chapter
[1:18:00] <iamtheTwitchghost> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug wait what
[1:18:02] <devanmuse> Woolie on the podcast in two weekss: "So I read Umineko... Beatrice is the bae"
[1:18:12] <tearfuldevil> @realestjojo wheel of time is like 5 war and peaces
[1:18:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> so how does this work
[1:18:12] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:18:13] <realestjojo> and he'll be correct
[1:18:14] <alephalpha> we could only dream
[1:18:16] <chhdez> @devanmuse Well, its the truth
[1:18:21] <realestjojo> in more ways than one

[1:18:25] <%wicketpelican> is the a mango or suave novel?
[1:18:26] <alephalpha> you could even say it in red
[1:18:27] <RunoEddie> Beato is greato
[1:18:32] <SailingSaturn> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug cirPat
[1:18:33] <realestjojo> say it in gold
[1:18:33] <+Vorga1339> is parsec a hamachi clone?
[1:18:34] <iamtheTwitchghost> beato Kreygasm
[1:18:37] <tearfuldevil> i think the only longer fantasy series in english is riftwar
[1:18:37] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @devanmuse Then pat sandbags the fuck outta him
[1:18:38] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @iamthetwitchghost for a long time the longest piece of literature ever written was a smash bros fanfic but it recently got dethroned
[1:18:39] <Starotter70> It's a VN but there's also a Manga
[1:18:41] <OkamiDude15> woolie will figure it out next episode will cover all of umineko
[1:18:43] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sailingsaturn cirComfy
[1:18:49] <%Superbro64> time to read the umineko vn, anime, manga, and re-watch through every vn updated releases to see the differences in each update :)
[1:18:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> also do we need anything to play with you besides a controller? @WoolieVersus
[1:18:50] <%pectusumbra> Alright, somebody, ANYBODY, we need the good meta shit! Knox and Erika please!
[1:18:51] <+zetastriker> But there's DEFINITELY NOT an anime
[1:18:54] <+zetastriker> >_>
[1:18:56] <%Superbro64> see you all in 2022 :)
[1:19:03] <iamtheTwitchghost> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug wow i never knew, gonna have to check that out atpRtsd
[1:19:11] <RunoEddie> I am kinda curious what is Woolie's impression on Umineko from what he might've heard
[1:19:20] <alephalpha> he's heard nothing
[1:19:23] <tearfuldevil> he knows nothing @RunoEddie
[1:19:26] <%wicketpelican> umineko looks like some extreme weeb shit
[1:19:28] <%Superbro64> people would spoil him on it?
[1:19:31] <realestjojo> Oh he'll never read it ever either
[1:19:32] <%Livelinne> !motivated

[1:20:09] <%Superbro64> lolno
[1:20:09] <realestjojo> the thing is this fighting game has a ton of spoilers with context
[1:20:11] <Nekros4442> Umineko isnt peak weebshit. Umineko is the portal to Higarashi which is true peak weebshit
[1:20:11] <KnivesEve> ah okay
[1:20:12] <%wicketpelican> is umineko more weeb than fate (besides zero)? or more weeb than kara no kyoukai?
[1:20:17] <+thrushjackson> !motivated
[1:20:17] <@Moobot> 1550 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:20:20] <+0range_Boy> Read Umineko
[1:20:21] <%Superbro64> woolie has a life, unlike chat doodStare
[1:20:29] <%ReiDuran> Umineko is pretty weeb, but it's really really interesting
[1:20:36] <realestjojo> it's about on the same level of weeb as Kara no Kyoukai
[1:20:41] <Arnschen> Ye, read Umineko. V good
[1:20:47] <realestjojo> maybe as much as Tsukihime
[1:20:48] <RunoEddie> it's not more weeb than Danganronpa, and Woolie did read those
[1:20:51] <%ReiDuran> Read Umineko,
[1:20:51] <+karmahoudini_guitar> how do we get to play with Woolie?
[1:21:01] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Superbro64 That's hurtful. Are you judging how I process grief?
[1:21:02] <RunoEddie> it's also better than Danganronpa
[1:21:05] <Arnschen> ^
[1:21:08] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[1:21:08] <%wicketpelican> but danranronpan has style u know looks like not weeb shit so woolie likes style
[1:21:09] <%Livelinne> Read Umineko woolieSMUG
[1:21:12] <RunoEddie> and I love Danganronpa
[1:21:16] <OkamiDude15> is there an audio book of umineko? sfhSMUG
[1:21:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Short break or are we already done with the stream?
[1:21:23] <realestjojo> @runoeddie realest shit said here
[1:21:25] <%ReiDuran> Yeah, but it's WAY more involved than Danganronpa. Trying to read Umineko will take a fuckload of time.
[1:21:26] <%BisoromiBear> Read Umineko, it's only a little over a million words.
[1:21:29] <+DenpaDev> in terms of story it's better, but there is way more
[1:21:34] <n33t_1337> How are you gonna do an audio book on blue and red text
[1:21:35] <%wicketpelican> umineko doesnt have style its just girls and dresses and dude fighting with teapot and a fuckin gun
[1:21:37] <%Superbro64> If I want a good reading experience in an afternoon, I wouls replay Ghost Trick
[1:21:37] <OkamiDude15> @CommanderSqueaks setting up parsec for matches
[1:21:40] <%huskarl_zap> @karmahoudini_guitar download a sus program that runs off your system folder
[1:21:46] <Starotter70> There WAS going to be an Audio drama
[1:21:55] <+Vorga1339> Is Parsec legit enough to play fighting games with? I'm looking at the site and it looks like a stadia style streaming thing.
[1:21:59] <+Vorga1339> never heard of it before
[1:22:02] <%ReiDuran> Umineko is a murder mystery
[1:22:04] <%Superbro64> there are a heck of lot of vns out there
[1:22:05] <Isphone555> Woolie WILL figure it out
[1:22:15] <OkamiDude15> @Vorga1339 its pretty legit
[1:22:18] <%wicketpelican> audio drama is really weeb like u listening the worst part of anime that is squicky japanese voices without the cool shit that is the cartoon thats peak weeb
[1:22:24] <iamtheTwitchghost> @Vorga1339 it's used to play UMVC3 online, yeah it's legit
[1:22:25] <Arnschen> We believe in you Woolie

[1:23:38] <floralkami> @vorga1339 it runs off your computer, so no. it wouldn't be anything as bad as stadia. and yes, it's VERY popular for playing games with bad netcode, like UMVC3 and DBFZ
[1:23:48] <Isphone555> I clicked it, but forgot my controller's broken. #Johns.
[1:24:02] <%Irridium> i keep getting timed out
[1:24:09] <%Superbro64> should people parsec'ing pause the stream?
[1:24:15] <%ekodrop> parsec doesn't queue properluy right? it just times out?

[1:26:55] <%ekodrop> i bet it's a the controller has to be connected to the game
[1:26:59] <rmwolfe> i hope this works, its a great idea for the stream
[1:27:00] <%ekodrop> when it starts
[1:27:03] <%WutangchickeN> maybe the controller isn't being recognized?
[1:27:03] <%JuliusGemstone> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[1:27:08] <Nekros4442> it's a learning process chat. Once the kinks get worked out this'll be gud
[1:27:10] <lem______> parseeeeeeec
[1:27:11] <+jiggy_snipe> disconnect Reggie's controller maybe
[1:27:14] <%RunningNGunning> Maybe its a game issue rather than a parsec issue
[1:27:15] <%Irridium> nope
[1:27:20] <%WutangchickeN> it's all good homies.
[1:27:20] <Arnschen> Turn off and back on?
[1:27:21] <+jiggy_snipe> so you only have 2 controllers
[1:27:28] <%WutangchickeN> play kb+m!
[1:27:34] <+karmahoudini_guitar> yeah probably need to disconnect Reggie
[1:27:35] <%JuliusGemstone> we can do this bois
[1:27:42] <+karmahoudini_guitar> the game probably only supports two controllers

[1:32:47] <%WutangchickeN> @solidus_113 could you mention a parsec command for the bot to Woolie?
[1:32:54] <realestjojo> hey if it can happen to her sisters
[1:32:59] <%WutangchickeN> might help

[1:33:12] <make_eye> no
[1:33:14] <%pectusumbra> Aunt and NIece
[1:33:21] <@Solidus_113> It'd likely change with each game, and it's only something Woolie'd want to allow in the moment, no need for a bot command
[1:33:22] <%TheSaltminer> MAGIC ISN'T REAL
[1:33:24] <make_eye> Rosa is someone else's mom
[1:33:25] <arkv01> the bullet is her daughter
[1:33:27] <GoIdenMaiden> Maria is Rosa's daughter
[1:33:29] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Maria is Rosa's daughter
[1:33:35] <%WutangchickeN> yeah that makes sense

[1:34:06] <Starotter70> Nah, just her color scheme
[1:34:08] <realestjojo> with jessica
[1:34:14] <+captain_history> it's Maria charging the second gun, she is not the bullet
[1:34:16] <%ReiDuran> Natsuhi is great

[1:35:00] <%ReiDuran> but just once
[1:35:03] <alephalpha> they are all gun moms except asumu
[1:35:05] <realestjojo> technically Higurashi and Umineko take place in the same world.....technically
[1:35:06] <gordieda20> just ignore that LUL
[1:35:09] <Arnschen> But all the stuff happening in this game is from the Visual Novel
[1:35:14] <%WutangchickeN> yeeted a baby LUL
[1:35:15] <dinnydanny777> Who yeeted a baby?
[1:35:16] <cyan_px> Heya

[1:40:10] <%pectusumbra> @tearfuldevil she does a fan for her school's festival, and the game makes it into a nico nico type thing with text flying across the screen while she dresses like a touhou
[1:40:10] <hiroy_raind> Any of you played Rose Guns Days? Was it good?
[1:40:12] <Starotter70> Murder
[1:40:16] <realestjojo> that's the best part. that this fighting game simultaneously spoils a lot and nothing at the same time
[1:40:20] <alephalpha> @RunoEddie yes a powerfuls tory about living with grief and the cycle of abuse and the natur eof love wrapped witha meta murde rmsytery
[1:40:20] <%pectusumbra> *band

[1:40:20] <Quigsies> Umineko is a murder mystery
[1:40:21] <Arnschen> Rose Guns Days was pretty good from what I played

[1:42:04] <tearfuldevil> honkers
[1:42:08] <floralkami> the bird fucking talks, omg
[1:42:15] <%Meekest> I never noticed the bird talks
[1:42:18] <%Malik1002> ijust want to win
[1:42:20] <%pectusumbra> Reggie, the meta is MIDAIR
[1:42:22] <Quigsies> Oh Erika, you great rat
[1:42:26] <%Meekest> It has Battler's voice OMEGALUL
[1:42:29] <chhdez> Bird is the word
[1:42:31] <floralkami> one thing worst than a goose.... a talking seagull
[1:42:40] <devanmuse> I mean... I'm sure there's a fragment where Shannon talks to birds... Catbox and shit
[1:43:04] <alephalpha> true
[1:43:10] <BlackermanZX> BIRB
[1:43:14] <%SirGO0SE> @floralkami DansGame
[1:43:17] <%BisoromiBear> he figured it out
[1:43:22] <%pectusumbra> YES. You build meter for your PARTNER
[1:43:25] <alephalpha> you build meter for the otehr character
[1:43:25] <iamtheTwitchghost> yeah
[1:43:27] <Arnschen> The partner gains meter in the background
[1:43:27] <blue6sub6remnant6> Guys, he figured it out.
[1:43:31] <%heartlesshealer> BOX
[1:43:33] <realestjojo> and they realize
[1:43:34] <townzzzzz> you build meter for the other character
[1:43:39] <dinnydanny777> Everybody knows that the bird is the word
[1:43:42] <rmwolfe> ah, woolie's golden truth
[1:43:44] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the partner gains meter in the background
[1:43:52] <floralkami> @SirGO0SE don't deny the TROOF
[1:44:05] <%sparkly_yoyo> Hey I just arrived, has Battler found out that all truth is lies?
[1:44:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:44:09] <%pectusumbra> And that's why there's only one health meter, you can't lose your partner in this game or it wouldn't work
[1:44:23] <%Superbro64> street fighter ex 3 may, I cant remember
[1:44:28] <%pectusumbra> wasn't able to do the command
[1:44:46] <%Superbro64> I do now that if your partner dies in ex3, you get 6 bars instead of 3, as a comeback mechanic
[1:44:48] <floralkami> @WoolieVersus you know that isn't true; MeltyBlood maids are all competent
[1:44:50] <rmwolfe> kohaku has potted plants
[1:44:51] <dinnydanny777> There should be a maid character who throws projectile plates, like bullets
[1:45:05] <tearfuldevil> thats not kohaku
[1:45:05] <TimetodiveLTX> kohaku attacks with broom, plants, and BOMBS
[1:45:08] <+Saggitori> didn't touhou do knife maid
[1:45:08] <tearfuldevil> thats the other one
[1:45:14] <%pectusumbra> yes
[1:45:14] <blue6sub6remnant6> Wait, Woolie is reading chat? Everybody STFU about the story.
[1:45:22] <%ReiDuran> Erika's Meta is F->HCF->C in the air, by the way
[1:45:23] <spardanwarrior> DIO knife maid
[1:45:23] <Starotter70> I think Kanon can jump off walls
[1:45:25] <%Superbro64> what maid doesnt have a bomb?
[1:45:33] <e1io> I'm pretty sure half the people don't know the story
[1:45:38] <floralkami> @blue6sub6remnant6 all of it is going right over his head, lol
[1:45:39] <tearfuldevil> @blue6sub6remnant6 its cute you think woolie will ever consume umineko, and that he gives a fuck about spoilers
[1:45:45] <+paladinstarbuster> @blue6sub6remnant6 hes never gonna read umineko dude
[1:45:46] <chhdez> Its about crazy shit
[1:45:49] <%heartlesshealer> yeah touhou had knife maid with time abilities
[1:45:51] <tearfuldevil> (umineko spoilers, i mean)
[1:45:58] <gordieda20> he ain't reading umineko
[1:45:59] <+Vorga1339> @blue6sub6remnant6 you think this dude has time for a vn between all of the other plates he's spinning
[1:46:03] <tearfuldevil> hell, i don't know umineko, and most people here don't
[1:46:04] <blue6sub6remnant6> Well guys, that's fair.
[1:46:04] <Arnschen> Woolie reading Umineko haha
[1:46:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> umineko spoilers make no sense either way lol
[1:46:06] <TimetodiveLTX> hisui, her sister, is the one that attacks with cooking tools, dust, vases
[1:46:13] <+AsinPersuasion> where are the girls tho
[1:46:13] <tearfuldevil> you weebs are jsut spouting references we don't get
[1:46:14] <%heartlesshealer> Bird gang
[1:46:14] <%sparkly_yoyo> knowing the story doesn't guarantee you *know* the story
[1:46:16] <+AsinPersuasion> those are both boys
[1:46:18] <dinnydanny777> bu bu bird bird bird
[1:46:26] <%pectusumbra> the seagulls are GREAT in this game though
[1:46:29] <TimetodiveLTX> and like a hypnotism beam? i don't get it
[1:46:29] <%SirGO0SE> birb gang birb gang birb gang
[1:46:31] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:46:36] <@Solidus_113> https://parsec.gg/g/1fF6Rc9CAwlFtOLFTtMsAAx5qli/8aa6c28e/
[1:46:51] <realestjojo> if Woolie ain't ever getting into Fate what would make you think he'd EVER get into Umineko
[1:46:53] <+Blokehat> Dudeakoff here, ggs I'm bad lol
[1:46:55] <%Solidnick18> huh
[1:47:08] <tearfuldevil> i keep getting timed out, is there a setting i can do to like, wiat?
[1:47:12] <%ReiDuran> Yeah there's no way
[1:47:18] <%ReiDuran> ZEN ZEN DAMEDA
[1:47:19] <Arnschen> Dame da
[1:47:19] <devanmuse> I'm waiting for woolie to get swept by a fucking KILLER at this game
[1:47:19] <%Livelinne> one can believe woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:47:20] <floralkami> damn, how does this thing work? how do we know we are in a queue? is there a queue?
[1:47:22] <tearfuldevil> cause it jsut says "connection timed out" after a couple seconds
[1:47:22] <UltimateDomon> He said the thing
[1:47:30] <tearfuldevil> @floralkami i dunno
[1:47:40] <TimetodiveLTX> no one plays ougon
[1:47:45] <%emperordread> who's this black suit phoneix wright looking dude?
[1:47:47] <Arnschen> Oh man Woolie
[1:47:51] <%heartlesshealer> yeah I see it
[1:47:52] <%Meekest> Oh Woolie
[1:47:53] <TimetodiveLTX> please play ougon
[1:47:55] <%JuliusGemstone> yeyeyeyeyeeye
[1:47:56] <%ReiDuran> @WoolieVersus it's called OPPAI FINGER
[1:47:57] <BlackermanZX> holy shit yeah
[1:47:58] <chhdez> He reminds me of P Wright he says
[1:48:01] <%pectusumbra> This is your ryu in this game
[1:48:06] <%pectusumbra> his ability is health regen
[1:48:07] <RunoEddie> I'd say it's different cause Fate fans are more numerous and they actively annoy Pat and Woolie but yeah, they won't fucking read Umineko, it's pointless to even think about it
[1:48:09] <gordieda20> Ye The blue truth bois
[1:48:16] <%Livelinne> d, dad color... shiaCry
[1:48:22] <rmwolfe> no, theyre saying youre right
[1:48:26] <%sparkly_yoyo> Battler is basically Phoenix Lite
[1:48:30] <Arnschen> No, it's that you are closer than you know
[1:48:30] <%ReiDuran> Yeah they're saying you're right
[1:48:32] <chhdez> Just use the super Woolie
[1:48:34] <+paladinstarbuster> theyre AGREEING WOOLIE
[1:48:34] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:48:35] <iamtheTwitchghost> that's the joke
[1:48:35] <BlackermanZX> goddamn Wright is the best
[1:48:36] <%Meekest> No Woolie you're just more right than you know
[1:48:37] <%BisoromiBear> you're more right than you could ever know
[1:48:39] <kasios> how is this debatable
[1:48:40] <%ReiDuran> Battler is basically Phoenix
[1:48:41] <%huskarl_zap> BURD
[1:48:43] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @alephalpha
[1:48:44] <%heartlesshealer> wow
[1:48:45] <floralkami> @WoolieVersus they were agreeing with you
[1:48:47] <Starotter70> Battler is very inspired by Phoenix
[1:48:52] <tearfuldevil> he's bassically a lawyer i think
[1:48:52] <%pectusumbra> He's the protagonist and an idiot
[1:48:53] <+xeros720> hmm, battler is definitely a reference to phoenix, but the fighting moveset might be a reference to this game
[1:48:56] <Starotter70> Nah
[1:48:56] <Arnschen> He has arguments
[1:48:56] <Lichzim> PogChamp
[1:48:57] <%JuliusGemstone> WHAT!?
[1:49:01] <rmwolfe> no, he just likes mysteries and points
[1:49:01] <%heartlesshealer> is he shooting energy birds out of his hand?
[1:49:01] <%pectusumbra> no, he's a highschooler
[1:49:02] <%JuliusGemstone> found my main
[1:49:02] <%ReiDuran> Not a lawyer but arguments are his weapon
[1:49:02] <+xeros720> no, he just fights peoplle with logics
[1:49:03] <%huskarl_zap> ahh the evil character
[1:49:03] <KalmVibrations> He's a person who argues a lot
[1:49:04] <Isphone555> Haha funney
[1:49:07] <gordieda20> He argues
[1:49:08] <%Livelinne> no hes 18 y o
[1:49:08] <%BisoromiBear> he's an objector
[1:49:09] <realestjojo> well...he sure does discuss truth and logic!
[1:49:14] <realestjojo> never forget
[1:49:15] <%sparkly_yoyo> Asking a person to read Umineko is basically asking someone to give up half their life
[1:49:19] <%pectusumbra> He left his family for 7 years and the first time he comes back, MURDERS
[1:49:20] <realestjojo> he's incompetent!
[1:49:22] <devanmuse> he is INCOMPETENT though
[1:49:26] <realestjojo> said in red truth!
[1:49:28] <%ReiDuran> @WoolieVersus He uses the Blue Truth
[1:49:30] <%SilverRoddo> BLEETZ
[1:49:30] <alephalpha> INCOMPETENT IN RED
[1:49:31] <%SirGO0SE> mic peaking?
[1:49:31] <knackirontarkus> SMALL BOMBS
[1:49:32] <@Solidus_113> oof the audio
[1:49:34] <Nero270> @WoolieVersus Supposed to be "logic" character, but the story subverts it in an interesting way
[1:49:39] <%sparkly_yoyo> I forgot is red lies?
[1:49:39] <%Meekest> Where's the small bombs
[1:49:44] <chhdez> He's the Doogie Howser of lawyers eh
[1:49:44] <%WutangchickeN> why the hell are like half the characters related to that clown dude from the Yakuza series? Bob Utsunomiya?
[1:49:48] <floralkami> @WoolieVersus your mic cant handle all this truth and meta
[1:49:49] <realestjojo> nah where's the trap doors
[1:49:51] <%pectusumbra> Canon!
[1:49:56] <Arnschen> He did the EX
[1:49:57] <+xeros720> oh, there's the transform mechanic
[1:49:59] <gordieda20> Red are absolute truth
[1:49:59] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[1:50:01] <%huskarl_zap> hands on? PogChamp
[1:50:03] <whiteblacklight74> he's not a lawyer but he's mystery vn guy
[1:50:05] <+xeros720> it works like a roman cancel
[1:50:05] <%sparkly_yoyo> Ah I had it backwards
[1:50:06] <GoIdenMaiden> If only Battler did that in ep 1
[1:50:12] <devanmuse> that wasn't canon
[1:50:24] <%sparkly_yoyo> Umineko's not canon
[1:50:26] <alephalpha> @WutangchickeN cause there was a guy named kinzo who amassed a fortuen off of relationships with the ghq and cuthroat invetsments
[1:50:29] <%sparkly_yoyo> >:T
[1:50:45] <+xeros720> and unmarked nazi gold
[1:50:50] <%WutangchickeN> lol... what? @alephalpha LUL
[1:50:53] <%sparkly_yoyo> Oh desire
[1:50:56] <%Meekest> There's A LOT of Nazi gold
[1:51:00] <%heartlesshealer> bird
[1:51:00] <%ReiDuran> All you need to know about Umineko is that a witch did it.
[1:51:03] <%sparkly_yoyo> Nazi gold's a thing
[1:51:05] <%ReiDuran> A witch always did it.
[1:51:07] <alephalpha> specifically italian fascists not nazis but basiclaly nazi's
[1:51:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1295605483974295559

[1:51:08] <gordieda20> Ay man Free gold Kappa
[1:51:08] <tearfuldevil> a witch did the nazi gold?
[1:51:09] <Starotter70> @WutangchickeN The tl;dr is that they're fucking rich
[1:51:09] <dinnydanny777> The Sonic Adventure style of voice directing?
[1:51:09] <chhdez> It's ALL nazi gold, cap'n
[1:51:23] <+xeros720> that's why she's the golden witch
[1:51:29] <+xeros720> she made that nazi gold
[1:51:29] <+paladinstarbuster> its easier if you understand them
[1:51:31] <%WutangchickeN> which of the fighting game characters fights with Nazi gold?
[1:51:36] <%sparkly_yoyo> Is Rosa in the game?
[1:51:38] <gordieda20> Rosa
[1:51:42] <%huskarl_zap> yes
[1:51:42] <+xeros720> Rosa should be
[1:51:43] <HotBloodedHero> Make the game loud to attract at the arcades
[1:51:44] <alephalpha> rosa has a super4 wher eshe hit's you with agiant ingot

[1:54:54] <Carefree_Kaleidoscope> honestly idk how anyone would get spoiled on plot from this, it all requires so much context to not just be percieved as randomness
[1:54:56] <alephalpha> @devanmuse peopel who lack hormones age more gracefully
[1:54:59] <%WutangchickeN> Beatrice must be OD cuz I swear she's been picked more than 60% of the time
[1:55:09] <%sparkly_yoyo> @Carefree_Kaleidoscope context only helps sometimes
[1:55:15] <alephalpha> @devanmuse welle xcept for the hoprrible boen brittleness

[1:59:14] <realestjojo> i still feel bad that the Alchemist versions censored the Touhou out
[1:59:29] <%pectusumbra> Jessica uses brass knuckles

[2:00:10] <Professor_Rakor> True fighters barf before they fight.
[2:00:10] <@akuda_bar> see i haven't read far at all, i don't even know who erika is
[2:00:11] <+Zelretch3000> krauss has a punchable face
[2:00:11] <%pectusumbra> and yes Erika is nuts. DEVIL WE NEED THAT ERIKA META
[2:00:27] <Klefth> Some of these character designs really slip into *that* realm of weebiness...
[2:00:28] <%SilverRoddo> How did she put on leggings?
[2:00:29] <MusouMiko> yeah isn't erika stupid good in this
[2:00:32] <kasios> WHY IS SHE SO HYPE THO
[2:00:32] <%sparkly_yoyo> Have they player as Funny Karate George?
[2:00:33] <%Meekest> For real we need some killers in these lobbies, Erika is top tier for a reason
[2:00:41] <%sparkly_yoyo> played*
[2:00:45] <alephalpha> @MusouMiko nope erika is like mid tier
[2:00:54] <%heartlesshealer> mada mada
[2:00:55] <Arnschen> She's in Episode 5, right after the anime ended
[2:00:58] <floralkami> @SilverRoddo surrounded by all this magic, and that's your question? LUL
[2:01:10] <realestjojo> @klefth you'd be surprised that it actually isn't
[2:01:12] <%WutangchickeN> ...there's an ANIME???
[2:01:16] <alephalpha> @floralkami what magic?

[2:01:30] <realestjojo> @wutangchicken no and don't believe anyone's lies that there are
[2:01:30] <Arnschen> Still sad we never got an anime version of Erika, even though the anime was terrible
[2:01:36] <floralkami> @alephalpha you're right, what was i thinking?
[2:01:37] <gordieda20> OH DESIRE
[2:01:37] <chhdez> *Conjures a giant flan* Magic doesnt exist!
[2:01:43] <%WutangchickeN> @realestjojo good lol
[2:02:00] <+nechallenger> There's the mizuumi wiki for this game
[2:02:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> so when's nidhogg @WoolieVersus

[2:02:45] <alephalpha> kanon is in this

[2:03:05] <BlackermanZX> can you launch into air shot
[2:03:06] <+jiggy_snipe> so how's the latency over parsec for people who had to connect?
[2:03:11] <floralkami> oh, so the mizuumi wiki is where you find data on the poverty games?
[2:03:17] <damienlunas> Jessica is literally the only character in this entire series who doesn't deserve death.
[2:03:20] <@akuda_bar> rosa is so fucking crazy
[2:03:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> @floralkami yep
[2:03:27] <Arnschen> Rosa is great

[2:03:29] <%huskarl_zap> Rosa shoots up the church just like dante would of done
[2:03:42] <tearfuldevil> yeah i dont know why i bothered
[2:03:42] <devanmuse> oh shit, the pen stab
[2:03:44] <chhdez> Pretty much no one deserved those deaths
[2:03:45] <alephalpha> @damienlunas umm I feel like you're missing acouple
[2:03:54] <Professor_Rakor> Child, fetch me more gun.

[2:04:12] <+Zelretch3000> uuu gun uuu uuuuu
[2:04:18] <%ekodrop> capt
[2:04:33] <%SilverRoddo> Those church-goers were nonplussed that there was a sick fight happening.
[2:04:37] <%kewlmyc> @chhdez Nah, the Ushiromiya family is filled with a bunch of crazy assholes. Some definitely deserved those deaths.
[2:04:38] <%JuliusGemstone> do it. noooo
[2:04:42] <%JuliusGemstone> cap noio
[2:04:46] <damienlunas> Only if you're willing to give her the child pass
[2:04:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[2:04:50] <@akuda_bar> i dunno if anyone deserves having their organs replaced with candy tho
[2:04:51] <Arnschen> Awww, Capt'n
[2:04:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> NOOOOOOOOO
[2:04:54] <alephalpha> @kewlmyc most people would say most of them did
[2:04:55] <%heartlesshealer> oh no
[2:04:55] <%sparkly_yoyo> once again, morally gray
[2:04:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> I DID
[2:05:05] <chhdez> @chhdez Not those specific deaths yo
[2:05:08] <realestjojo> @kewlmyc the kids didn't (although Battler is a point of contention)
[2:05:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:05:10] <Arnschen> I mean, I'd have my organs replaced with candy
[2:05:10] <%JuliusGemstone> riiiip
[2:05:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm there
[2:05:30] <%JuliusGemstone> get it cap
[2:05:31] <+Zelretch3000> pat would
[2:05:36] <%JuliusGemstone> eyyyy
[2:05:47] <realestjojo> the spouses to the adults didn't really deserve the deaths either
[2:05:47] <@akuda_bar> yeah i wouldn't go "yeah that guy was an asshole he deserved to get mpreg with snickers bars"
[2:05:48] <%JuliusGemstone> NOOOO
[2:05:52] <alephalpha> @realestjojo battler's sin when you sonsider 12 year old going to live with his grandparents cause his dad is a cheater is kinda yeah
[2:05:59] <%SirGO0SE> connection timed out means its too unstable or full?
[2:06:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> all i have is my shitty laptop
[2:06:05] <%kewlmyc> @realestjojo Yeah, Maria and Jessica are pretty innocent. George is also cool, and Battler is only implied to be a total asshole.
[2:06:05] <%sparkly_yoyo> magic ain't real anyway so nothing happened
[2:06:11] <%JuliusGemstone> Is it?!
[2:06:15] <@akuda_bar> battler's sin is sexualizing his baby cousin
[2:06:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> that doesn't have an ethernet port
[2:06:23] <%sparkly_yoyo> George was super cool in the most bullshit way
[2:06:24] <damienlunas> @akuda_bar That never happened though because witches don't exist :p
[2:06:26] <realestjojo> @alephalpha I did say he's the only one!

[2:09:01] <Arnschen> Oh nooooo, it's George. I hate his Meta
[2:09:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, i may not be able to play with ya'll on parsec due to not having a stable connection from my shit laptop
[2:09:01] <%JuliusGemstone> @ekodrop Name it fam less go!
[2:09:02] <realestjojo> so Parsec does actually work well enough huh to be played in tournament settings?
[2:09:03] <floralkami> @JuliusGemstone scottfModo scottfModo scottfModo
[2:09:13] <%kewlmyc> George the fatass
[2:09:20] <TimetodiveLTX> nice TOU, that's the correct way to jump guys
[2:09:20] <Arnschen> FAT GEORGE

[2:09:51] <realestjojo> also George looks good in the Edgeworth colors
[2:09:54] <%dots4eyes> We need Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee matchup
[2:09:55] <Potatoidea> Is this a Umineko fighter?
[2:09:58] <chhdez> Right in the kisser
[2:10:01] <+Blokehat> Parsec working better than some games' native netcode oughta be kinda embarsssing
[2:10:05] <%kewlmyc> I love that everyone thought George was fat due to the bad original art
[2:10:06] <floralkami> @Potatoidea yep
[2:10:09] <@akuda_bar> jessica punching battler in the dick is canon
[2:10:11] <Potatoidea> Thanks
[2:10:21] <TimetodiveLTX> yeah, this game is supposed to have rollback on PC as well.
[2:10:32] <%JuliusGemstone> @ekodrop nah nah I see how it is, talking the game but to scared to finish the fight.
[2:10:53] <@akuda_bar> hopefully by watching this i'll be motivated to finish reading
[2:11:23] <%ekodrop> @JuliusGemstone what fight? you lag so hard you wouldn't be able to move
[2:11:27] <Arnschen> As you get to the later episodes and things pick up, you'll def be more interested
[2:11:33] <gordieda20> I like how they picked Rosa over any of the Gun mom
[2:11:35] <%ekodrop> @JuliusGemstone automatic 0-2
[2:11:39] <gordieda20> moms*
[2:11:42] <+Piemen99> oooh is that blonde woolie bait?
[2:11:48] <chhdez> Yes
[2:11:51] <%siobhancake> blessed umineko stream, rosa best
[2:11:52] <@akuda_bar> @Arnschen this might explain it: i was in the habit of reading it *on the go* on my phone. so obviously that doesnt happen anymore
[2:11:52] <whiteblacklight74> Joji reminds me of SFEX Ryu
[2:11:52] <+Piemen99> nice
[2:11:52] <realestjojo> ohhh yeah

[2:12:32] <%kewlmyc> Oh yeah, Battler has that weird ass groping tits attack
[2:12:43] <Arnschen> The kick has a follow up
[2:12:44] <%BisoromiBear> Child abuse is okay if you have sick gun skills
[2:12:55] <kasios> YOOO
[2:12:57] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:12:58] <e1io> they put a clock when it's low on time, that's cool

[2:13:04] <iamtheTwitchghost> dang
[2:13:06] <realestjojo> that clock is such a good touch
[2:13:07] <%JuliusGemstone> @ekodrop why you picking on me?! I'm not trying to embarrass my ass infront of everyone here!
[2:13:07] <%siobhancake> LUL LUL
[2:13:16] <Potatoidea> All I know about Umineko is that there's witches, everyone dresses fancy, and one of the songs has a sample of Data from Star Trek in it; maybe this'll teach me more
[2:13:19] <+Zelretch3000> sad that no one did Erika meta
[2:13:19] <chhdez> Child abuse is only ok when children are not involved
[2:13:21] <Arnschen> Awww
[2:13:23] <@akuda_bar> that sure is a name
[2:13:24] <kasios> WutFace

[2:14:27] <e1io> BIRDS
[2:14:29] <Potatoidea> Liking the Escher background
[2:14:30] <floralkami> i was really hoping to play this game a bit, even if i did get my ass rocked
[2:14:33] <chhdez> Those-rich-assholes
[2:14:36] <Aquatic_Lotus> bird gang
[2:14:44] <realestjojo> are has exactly the voice she does
[2:14:46] <iamtheTwitchghost> atpRtsd
[2:14:53] <+0range_Boy> *any chance you can get in 1 person who actively plays the game*
[2:14:53] <realestjojo> *she has
[2:14:55] <%kewlmyc> Umineko pretty much boils down to "yeah rich people suck"
[2:15:03] <damienlunas> My biggest issue by far with Umineko is with the 1st chapter. Both Battler and George not seeing that [Redacted] isn't there, but the narration making you think [Redacted] is there.
[2:15:04] <biomegabear> aageis reflector normals maid
[2:15:05] <@akuda_bar> she sure has a voice @realestjojo
[2:15:06] <%chll0ne> woolieKICKDAD
[2:15:11] <@akuda_bar> now i'm judging George so hard
[2:15:13] <+0range_Boy> First chapter is kinda slow
[2:15:31] <chhdez> "We're super rich and hot, but bored, we should totally kill each other"
[2:15:31] <Arnschen> Oh wait Akuda, are you playing it with the PS3 Patch?
[2:15:32] <@akuda_bar> yeah 0rangeboy deserves it
[2:15:35] <+Blokehat> trading sweeps is always great
[2:15:44] <%ReiDuran> EVA a shit
[2:15:45] <%JuliusGemstone> just got to shake it off though, I'll get there.
[2:15:48] <Arnschen> With the voices and PS3 sprites?
[2:15:49] <@akuda_bar> @Arnschen nope, vanilla steam. i don't hate the retro models so it's FINE
[2:15:50] <%ReiDuran> this post made by Ange gang
[2:15:57] <+0range_Boy> Dude you can judge george cause he's trying to date a 16 year old
[2:15:59] <+0range_Boy> And he's 23
[2:16:06] <@akuda_bar> h-he what. did i not notice that
[2:16:07] <alephalpha> he thinks she's 19 but styill
[2:16:14] <%siobhancake> ange gang lmao
[2:16:15] <Arnschen> Ahh, yeah the og sprites are at least better than the Pachinko sprites
[2:16:15] <+0range_Boy> yeahhhhhhhh
[2:16:18] <+Zelretch3000> who's the biggest milf of the spouse?
[2:16:21] <+0range_Boy> ALso it's alright Akuda
[2:16:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> monkaS
[2:16:25] <+0range_Boy> i guess I accepted my fate
[2:16:27] <%kewlmyc> Ange got is so bad, like holy shit.
[2:16:36] <damienlunas> George is also kind of a creep? Like his interactions with Shannon make him feel kind of niceguyish.
[2:16:38] <WG101> okay, yeah, rosa had every right to beat george's ass that last match
[2:16:44] <biomegabear> that's an akuma super
[2:16:47] <%dots4eyes> Why isn't there a Home Alone fighting game?
[2:16:49] <alephalpha> @damienlunas george is 200%a creep
[2:16:53] <chhdez> Is this the game where the VN has the weirdest perspective using photos as BG?
[2:16:54] <@akuda_bar> george seems wholesome in chapter 2 but i can see him getting.. bad
[2:17:01] <+0range_Boy> I will make a funny video from me calling out Woolie and telling him not to do the fucking fan art
[2:17:13] <tearfuldevil> @ha2ken cause the characters would be kevin, theif 1, thief 2, pigeon lady
[2:17:15] <%kewlmyc> George is incel in the making, is what I'm hearing?
[2:17:18] <%TheSaltminer> Shannon or Hisui?
[2:17:20] <tearfuldevil> kind of a smallc ast list
[2:17:22] <%emperordread> Wakeup birds are called Roosters
[2:17:30] <SpiritOfThuggery> George goes to r/braincell daily
[2:17:32] <alephalpha> once again depending on if you have love in your ehart you can intepret most characters extremely fdifferently
[2:17:34] <Sulfur_Boride> What's this game? Doesn't look bad.
[2:17:35] <@akuda_bar> @kewlmyc he's not an incel he's just the kind of guy who would retire with a 20 year old wife
[2:17:42] <damienlunas> If I show her these Fish she HAS to have sex with me.
[2:17:47] <Potatoidea> Oh hey, there's a cat in the background
[2:17:54] <+Zelretch3000> @TheSaltminer kohaku ez
[2:17:57] <%pectusumbra> Its umineko golden fantasia
[2:18:03] <TimetodiveLTX> ougon for short
[2:18:04] <alephalpha> @kewlmyc there's literallya aprt in the novel where george describe shimself being an incel and getting over that
[2:18:05] <+Blokehat> George used to be an incel, literally used to think he was the ultimate gentleman
[2:18:06] <%heartlesshealer> Ougon Musou Kyoku Cross
[2:18:14] <Sulfur_Boride> Not what I meant, but I guess I deserved it regardless
[2:18:15] <+0range_Boy> hey don't say much to Akuda she's still reading it
[2:18:18] <%huskarl_zap> so chad

[2:20:20] <iamtheTwitchghost> atpRtsd
[2:20:21] <%Superbro64> LUL
[2:20:24] <%chll0ne> LUL
[2:20:24] <@akuda_bar> you could potentially like it, honestly. but you don't have the time, at least
[2:20:26] <%pectusumbra> Maybe look at the manga
[2:20:30] <%ReiDuran> Umineko is cool but this is 0% Woolie's jam.
[2:20:32] <+0range_Boy> read the manga!
[2:20:33] <chhdez> Could you show off some spoopy supers?
[2:20:35] <Arnschen> The manga is legit amazing
[2:20:36] <+0range_Boy> It's super sick
[2:20:38] <damienlunas> Yeah Umineko is fucking LONG. And repetitive.
[2:20:38] <%Meekest> Yeah just read a 120 hour VN
[2:20:38] <%Superbro64> How about we play fighting games here chat :)
[2:20:43] <fangovafang> wats good woolie n chat
[2:20:43] <TimetodiveLTX> yknow what
[2:20:44] <%chll0ne> ha nerds!
[2:20:45] <BlackermanZX> So its like Fate/Stay the fuck away
[2:20:48] <alephalpha> read the 200 hour vn
[2:20:49] <MethodiaLordae> UH OH
[2:20:49] <TimetodiveLTX> i'm gonna read a 120 hour VN
[2:20:50] <TimetodiveLTX> fuck it
[2:20:53] <+RealPT1> first two eps of anime will at least give you the set up
[2:20:53] <Sulfur_Boride> Tricky, you say?
[2:20:53] <realestjojo> I will say tho that him liking Dangan Ronpa he would def appreciate aspects of Umineko
[2:20:54] <MethodiaLordae> HERE WE GO GAMERS
[2:20:57] <%kewlmyc> Problem is that there's like a different manga for each episode. Shit's confusing
[2:20:58] <@akuda_bar> he'd like all the debating and shit, but it's also 120 fucking hours long
[2:20:58] <%chll0ne> @blackermanzx yes
[2:20:59] <Arnschen> And does the story justice tbh
[2:20:59] <alephalpha> 120hours si jusy for questions arcs
[2:21:01] <+0range_Boy> if you didn't get to play ougon and you have it I'll play with you
[2:21:09] <@akuda_bar> it's the pinnacle of "the characters have figured it out before you"
[2:21:10] <%chll0ne> but i stay away from fate too LUL
[2:21:11] <floralkami> ngl, i would be down for a 120hr long VN with all this going down right now
[2:21:18] <biomegabear> is this toulouse fighter?
[2:21:18] <chhdez> Let's all buy it
[2:21:20] <%ReiDuran> The first like, 20-30 hours of Umineko are all setup and it's super slow.
[2:21:21] <+0range_Boy> Trust me, Umineko is well worth trying
[2:21:25] <%chll0ne> unless its looking at the character designs from fgo on danbooru
[2:21:26] <%pectusumbra> for anyone that wants to see them, there's a youtube video of all the meta and super moves
[2:21:26] <rmwolfe> woolie would genuinely hate umineko's themes
[2:21:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> NUNS4 can connect
[2:21:31] <%sparkly_yoyo> Umineko is a full time job
[2:21:32] <hiroy_raind> @floralkami Get Baldr Sky then, it actually is that long.
[2:21:34] <+Vorga1339> so umineko boys what is the name of that character select theme?

[2:22:39] <dinnydanny777> Is it Shrek Super Slam?
[2:22:39] <%ReiDuran> It's a really cool VN but it's very very slow
[2:22:51] <+0range_Boy> I'm out, please consider reading Umineko
[2:22:56] <@akuda_bar> yeah it's like five times slower than phoenix wright
[2:22:58] <%Superbro64> There's a collection coming to steam / ps4 at some point in fact
[2:23:08] <%TheSaltminer> is this the game with the teabagging schoolgirl?
[2:23:09] <%BisoromiBear> SourPls

[2:23:58] <Sulfur_Boride> Is his name actually supposed to be "Pierre", but localization and Engrish?
[2:24:00] <%pectusumbra> Also, YEAH BLACK BATTLER IS BIG SPOILERS
[2:24:04] <blue6sub6remnant6> "Sprites from MUGEN" That sounds about right.
[2:24:14] <%eanscrale> They were very forward with their localization efforts
[2:24:19] <GeltonZ> @Sulfur_Boride But of course
[2:24:22] <%Superbro64> finally, a real fighting game, for real people Kappa
[2:24:27] <realestjojo> Black Butler also needs the MOST context to be a spoiler

[2:25:04] <+Vorga1339> also not to remain stuck in the last game but got one last question, is Higarashi its own thing or does that need to be read before Umineko?

[2:48:29] <GeltonZ> @TimetodiveLTX Breakers Collection is coming but not out.
[2:48:31] <%nicversus> Condor is literally just dollar store T Hawk
[2:48:40] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie denies his Shotoness
[2:48:40] <+RollingMarbleSound> mom I want t hawk!
[2:48:48] <ShinobiPhoenix> is Rila supposed to be the Zangief? or the Blanka?
[2:48:48] <GeltonZ> @floralkami LOOKS like Super Turbo, PLAYS more like Alpha 2 which is really weird.
[2:48:48] <+RollingMarbleSound> we have t hawk at home
[2:48:50] <+TopTieramisu> i'll take she-blanka over blanka

[2:50:27] <%DSD24> I like Rila
[2:50:34] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Sho and Hanzo on top, Tia shortly after, everyone else, then Maherl and Allison at the very bottom...but everyone is darn viable as you can see.
[2:50:35] <TimetodiveLTX> yeah you find a good game in the arcade cabinet section of the major, then the guy next to you playing just tells you there's an S+ tier
[2:50:42] <TimetodiveLTX> feels bad
[2:50:43] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Ah yes Breakers Revenge my fave game to feature in mystery tournaments
[2:50:47] <Lordbahamut780> Lol
[2:51:01] <%nicversus> BUT!
[2:51:15] <+TopTieramisu> no perfect

[2:51:39] <%nicversus> I like condor's assless chaps and loincloth combination

[2:53:31] <TimetodiveLTX> ok i realize now the spin move is supposed to be blanka electricity, but all I see is peach d-smash
[2:53:39] <@Solidus_113> the fear
[2:53:41] <SatoruMasamune> Woolie does best with the beastial character. ACT SURPRISED.
[2:53:44] <%huskarl_zap> ya fookin tosser
[2:53:50] <floralkami> ngl..... Rila could get it..... but she'd more likely take me instead
[2:54:02] <GeltonZ> @TimetodiveLTX HA! I totally see that. Move is great for buffering charges.
[2:54:11] <%nicversus> Ok I won't be mean to this game anymore it looks pretty fun
[2:54:11] <MethodiaLordae> go to horny jail
[2:54:21] <Potatoidea> They forgot the "to" on the end of this guy's name

[2:54:48] <Hoarseplay> Did anyone show Woolie the true insanity of Breakers Extra Mode?
[2:54:49] <yojohny> Spicy kitty
[2:54:54] <%nicversus> YES you can pet the dog in Breaker's Revenge... in a manner of speaking
[2:54:55] <floralkami> "can i pet the cat?" "you can TRY"
[2:55:20] <+jiggy_snipe> choked so hard
[2:55:25] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay I dunno if he knows yet.
[2:55:27] <%nicversus> that right there was this games "moment 37"
[2:55:34] <PlanetNixia> Sho might be one of my favorite Shoto character mizziLit
[2:55:46] <%nicversus> or the closest to a moment 37 this game could ever hope for anyway
[2:55:51] <%huskarl_zap> Sho to
[2:55:56] <TimetodiveLTX> yo he got away with it
[2:55:57] <%nicversus> I lied I'll never stop being mean to this game
[2:56:01] <whiteblacklight74> sho with the tech
[2:56:04] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Oh you don't know about Extra Mode and Loss Cancelling..
[2:56:37] <%nicversus> are you messing with me, or does this game have real tech/
[2:56:51] <lbrownthedestroyer> OH MY God i love this game
[2:56:52] <%DSD24> I like that win pose
[2:56:56] <MethodiaLordae> I wanna see Sho embrace the dark hado
[2:56:57] <floralkami> man, Ryu is such a fucking boring ass character, and i'll never get over it
[2:56:57] <%DSD24> Its pretty hype
[2:56:58] <Hoarseplay> Sho is the single best shoto character to exist. He has every tool you'd want and a few more for the hell of it.
[2:57:13] <%nicversus> Oh look it's bootleg fei long's stage
[2:57:27] <MethodiaLordae> Rila is so rad
[2:57:43] <%DSD24> Oh wow that flex
[2:57:43] <+jiggy_snipe> swole
[2:57:50] <Hoarseplay> Dao-Long is nothing like Fei outside of being Chinese.
[2:57:54] <%nicversus> The design philosophy of this game was to make the player say "oh wow just like street fighter"
[2:57:57] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Oh this game absolutely has tech. But "Extra Mode" is an interesting busted mess from the NeoGeo CD version that lets you cancel EVERYTHING. Even losing. You can cancel out of the losing knock down, get ONE MORE HIT, and if you KO your oppponent your loss becomes a draw.
[2:58:15] <MethodiaLordae> That's RAD
[2:58:26] <%nicversus> oh wait does this game have an MVS version?
[2:58:34] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Yup
[2:58:34] <%nicversus> I might buy this game
[2:58:52] <lbrownthedestroyer> Oh this game was Neo Geo CD and JP arcade that is why it wasnt successful
[2:59:06] <MethodiaLordae> as an arcade game, it's not a bad approach, build on the familiar
[2:59:13] <lbrownthedestroyer> @nicversus You buying a Japanese arcade machine Nice
[2:59:17] <MethodiaLordae> ultimate quarter stealer
[2:59:18] <%nicversus> Every fighting game was at least modestly successful in the 90s
[2:59:24] <+heyitsdenzel_> the game came out on the dreamcast in 2017
[2:59:30] <%nicversus> in Japan anyway
[2:59:31] <MethodiaLordae> huh
[2:59:50] <GeltonZ> @lbrownthedestroyer It was also made by Visco. WHO THE CRAP IS VISCO! They made mediocre puzzle games and now they make TVs. What business do they have making such a hype fighter?!
