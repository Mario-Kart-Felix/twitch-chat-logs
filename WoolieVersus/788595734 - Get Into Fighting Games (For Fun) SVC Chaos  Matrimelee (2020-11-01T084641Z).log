[0:12:10] <ikantreeed> GOBLIGOOK

[0:12:14] <yeildingthought> Ninja in MK 11 Kappa
[0:12:16] <huskarl_zap> 90 year old veitnam veteran
[0:12:17] <@Menitta> what do you mean you dont like the idea of being subjugated to Sub Zero's spine rip
[0:12:19] <deafmelone> Feels good, Sounds good~
[0:12:20] <+Balkespower> WHY
[0:12:20] <soul4rce> the android guy
[0:12:25] <@akuda_bar> pokimane in mk
[0:12:26] <BedHome> ninja in mk11 and he isnt a ninja
[0:12:34] <+JustToWatch> Mileena canceled last minute to put Woolie in the game
[0:12:37] <ikantreeed> Ninja's fatality
[0:12:41] <kikoeru_san> if Roy Batty was in MK I would buy
[0:12:43] <%wibbwobbler> can't wait
[0:12:56] <BedHome> ninjas fatality is he switches to a different game
[0:13:05] <BedHome> and different streaming platform
[0:13:10] <xandertthetogepi> svc chaos is a fun game
[0:13:16] <xandertthetogepi> i played it once on a computer
[0:13:16] <+TungstenViper> Roy Batty is basically Bryan from Tekken3
[0:13:19] <+toastybites> Imagine if Ninja is Earthrealm's new champions
[0:13:21] <%Malik1002> then why you in skullgirls to
[0:13:25] <xandertthetogepi> max mode made it feel cool
[0:13:27] <andre11dr> That's why Woolie is in Skullgirls
[0:13:32] <andre11dr> Kappa
[0:13:51] <ThatGuyThere03> Has Rambo done cross-overs?
[0:13:51] <GeltonZ> SvC Chaos is fine if you don't play charge characters and have all the secret characters unlocked. But charge characters do not fucking work in SvC Chaos.
[0:13:54] <Arisato_II> So basically we make a Woolie horror movie AND THEN we wait for the MK guest character
[0:13:56] <BedHome> @WoolieVersus your franchise has a vs in (jokes)
[0:13:57] <@Menitta> girl from Recore for MK11
[0:14:05] <Viewtiful_Rose> Ash Vs. As well
[0:14:08] <%Jetzord> So we should get MLP in MK12
[0:14:14] <kikoeru_san> Woolie is already in like 3 fighting games tho
[0:14:17] <+zanzibar_junker> One Armed Swordsman for MK11
[0:14:18] <+squishy1002> woolie in def jam reboot confirmed
[0:14:21] <%Terrarp> Whatever happened to Ash Williams in MK?
[0:14:28] <+casssmithart> Master Raven?
[0:14:29] <SomersaultJustice> kunimitsu?
[0:14:30] <@Menitta> Why is NEGAN in Tekken?
[0:14:31] <BedHome> forreal (not for real) we should crowdkick for woolie to be in the next reboot game
[0:14:37] <giogio346> no +r today?
[0:14:37] <Arisato_II> "I don't see enough flossing, prepare to die"
[0:14:38] <SomersaultJustice> why is NOCTIS in tekken
[0:14:39] <Viewtiful_Rose> I think legal reasons ash was scrapped
[0:14:45] <andre11dr> It was weird was Negan was in Tekken too
[0:14:46] <Darren716> Woolie i think youre really overthinking this
[0:15:02] <andre11dr> When*
[0:15:05] <kikoeru_san> Woolie? Overthink? Never
[0:15:08] <BedHome> @WoolieVersus like would you rather be a mk ninja or an evil energy user or a world forces member?
[0:15:15] <+TungstenViper> Most guest characters are dumb addition are there just to attract non fans into the game
[0:15:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:15:27] <Viewtiful_Rose> Ash was the character that would get me to play MK11 but apparently he’s scrapped cuz legal shit
[0:15:40] <andre11dr> We overthink because we really smurt

[0:16:17] <andre11dr> It was made when SNK was basically bankrupt

[0:21:34] <%gatorafan> Future Ryu (forma de mascara)
[0:21:38] <+TungstenViper> SO COOL
[0:21:38] <%manwhoisputty> tiger tiger tiger
[0:21:40] <SomersaultJustice> Gauge Consumption Dash
[0:21:54] <+MisterRaffles> It's crazy how you take generic karate man, slap a badass Tengu Mask, and the design is 10/10.
[0:21:55] <DublinRage> @woolieversus does this version have the sprite color change mode like the one on XBOX?
[0:21:59] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[0:22:00] <this_guy_115> Goenitz more like a cold snowy evening with your blanket on

[0:22:02] <%Terrarp> I forgot Megaman Zero was part of this
[0:22:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> i forgot this game has hugo
[0:22:06] <%SableS139a> MMZ Zero = FUCK YES
[0:22:08] <Pingo_Pasketti> Rare footage of Demitri actually in a game
[0:22:11] <SomersaultJustice> woolie chooses boss, reggie chooses ryu. all is right with the world
[0:22:13] <Melzmaster75> I hate how this game has GBA Zero but he isn't a base character.
[0:22:16] <Pache94> this ost
[0:22:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:19] <SHSLSpiritHunter> oooh, its zero... from megaman zero.... neeeeeat...
[0:22:25] <black_pariah> Ryu di
[0:22:27] <Arisato_II> Fight me at the Nude Place
[0:22:29] <%SableS139a> Also the first time Zero's playable, and like in later fighting games, he's fucking busted.
[0:22:34] <andre11dr> So this is Ryo as Mr Karate
[0:22:34] <+TungstenViper> specific animations are cooler tho
[0:22:34] <kikoeru_san> these character intros are what make KoFXIII super cool in Arcade mode
[0:22:37] <+odd_slater> Kreygasm

[0:23:18] <SomersaultJustice> just don't whiff 4Head
[0:23:19] <fangovafang> Wat up everyone LuvPeekL
[0:23:21] <black_pariah> Ryu doesn't seem like the type to call someone big nose, that's more Ken
[0:23:22] <andre11dr> Oh that's wat it was ,just trow takes meter
[0:23:24] <%RyTYoung> !uptime
[0:23:24] <CyberEne> im gonna play gg until online
[0:23:24] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 31 minutes and 21 seconds
[0:23:27] <+ManOfReason> That dash tho
[0:23:30] <%Parlux> Yo that clock is to fast
[0:23:37] <andre11dr> I think tech takes meter as well
[0:23:45] <+TungstenViper> so weird
[0:23:46] <%gatorafan> Just play perfect
[0:23:47] <kairumustdie> also, no KOF-style jumping in the SNK game for some reason
[0:24:02] <+TungstenViper> no super jump?
[0:24:05] <andre11dr> And sometimes meter just charges, like tension in GG
[0:24:07] <kairumustdie> no hops
[0:24:12] <+arknodem> Oh shit. SvC Chaos.
[0:24:16] <%Parlux> Am I the only one who thinks KOF is better than street fighter?
[0:24:18] <andre11dr> I don't remember how tho
[0:24:22] <+TungstenViper> also the dashes in this game are so stiff
[0:24:24] <soul4rce> yes
[0:24:26] <this_guy_115> Yes
[0:24:32] <this_guy_115> Wait no
[0:24:41] <fangovafang> this music tho lmao
[0:24:43] <%Parlux> ...Fuck you guys Kof 98 is a banger!
[0:24:49] <kairumustdie> the backgrounds in this game are really fucking cool tho
[0:24:55] <soul4rce> I prefer sf2 over 98
[0:24:56] <Arisato_II> No Escape
[0:25:03] <+TungstenViper> the stages are weird, but i like them
[0:25:04] <%Parlux> Wha?
[0:25:04] <kairumustdie> an snk vs capcom game shouldn't take place in the post apocalypse
[0:25:08] <DoctorArby> The flash name= Final DM
[0:25:08] <+the22cstomp> snk still has good spritework even if they dont make a good game
[0:25:10] <kairumustdie> but they look cool anyway
[0:25:20] <%Parlux> Yo you guys are killing me
[0:25:24] <this_guy_115> Example is snk Balrog
[0:25:28] <andre11dr> @parlux I like the caracters more
[0:25:35] <+TungstenViper> the lore is, the characters are all in purgatory. that's why the stages are all post apocalyptic and empty.
[0:25:37] <this_guy_115> Much cooler than sf balrog sprite
[0:25:58] <%gatorafan> @kairumustdie, they wasted their chance to use Ken from Street Fighter 2010 Kappa
[0:26:05] <andre11dr> Like i like most of the cast ,in SF i like half, Maybe less
[0:26:12] <%SableS139a> @gatorafan LUL
[0:26:14] <extradopeness> KoF 98 is fuckin great
[0:26:15] <%Parlux> SNK fighters are better than Capcom fighters prove me wrong.
[0:26:25] <this_guy_115> I c a n ' t
[0:26:31] <soul4rce> samsho 7
[0:26:34] <+Rabbitmage> Just like a woman
[0:26:35] <soul4rce> gottem
[0:26:38] <+TungstenViper> @Parlux are we really going there?
[0:26:38] <SomersaultJustice> neowave
[0:26:46] <soul4rce> battle colliseum
[0:26:57] <au_d3n> ?
[0:27:03] <%Parlux> Every SF game. Bison is boss. KOF some fly ass boss thats gonna crush you and and make you cry to mommy
[0:27:14] <au_d3n> !
[0:27:15] <soul4rce> Parlux, Sf3 and 4
[0:27:15] <kairumustdie> so the systems are weird and all, but is it a better game than capcom fighting jam?
[0:27:15] <%SableS139a> @Parlux If we're talking SF, I agree for the most part (I love 3 & Alpha, sue me), but Darkstalkers is too sick for me to pass up.
[0:27:31] <soul4rce> also 1
[0:27:48] <this_guy_115> I thought people disliked 4?
[0:27:49] <andre11dr> @soul4rce SF 1?
[0:27:56] <soul4rce> yeah
[0:27:58] <andre11dr> Are you high
[0:27:59] <%Parlux> the roster is crazy
[0:28:02] <%Parlux> GBA zero
[0:28:03] <soul4rce> also sf4 was hella popular
[0:28:13] <andre11dr> Have you actually played SF 1
[0:28:14] <%Parlux> Alien from Metal slug
[0:28:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> samsho characters and one third strike character
[0:28:16] <soul4rce> yes
[0:28:25] <andre11dr> It nearly works
[0:28:26] <this_guy_115> Martian
[0:28:26] <SHSLSpiritHunter> zero with EXTRA depression.
[0:28:32] <Arisato_II> Mars people from Metal Slug woooo
[0:28:33] <soul4rce> sf1 is so bad
[0:28:33] <townzzzzz> almost all of them
[0:28:38] <+the22cstomp> demitri
[0:28:39] <brunoberserk> yeah svc chaos , i like this game more than cvs 2 ,FIGHT ME !
[0:28:41] <%SableS139a> @Parlux GBA Zero is also hella busted (like in every fighting game he seems to appear in), but I love how he plays here.
[0:28:49] <%gatorafan> How cool of Woolie to install a pause button on his arcade cabinet
[0:28:59] <+TungstenViper> Iori and Kyo are not really shotos
[0:29:08] <SomersaultJustice> nice seeing red earth representation
[0:29:15] <%Parlux> Yo I never knew so many shotos
[0:29:18] <this_guy_115> kyo was only a shoto until kof 96
[0:29:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:24] <Darren716> Oops all shotos
[0:29:30] <%SableS139a> And somehow, SNK made Demitri even cooler than he is in his home series. Only OVA Demitri comes close.
[0:29:30] <andre11dr> @soul4rce Oh wait, you're talking about the bosses, i thought you were actually telling me SF 1 is good LUL
[0:29:30] <@Solidus_113> fireball, uppercut, tatsumaki
[0:29:37] <andre11dr> Sorry
[0:29:41] <+jiggy_snipe> shoto is fireball and uppercut, tastu is optional
[0:29:41] <theanora1> is this on a GBA or something?
[0:29:48] <fangovafang> K I M
[0:29:49] <+the22cstomp> yes
[0:29:52] <+TungstenViper> Ryo and takuma yes
[0:29:53] <kairumustdie> whoa now Kyo isn't a shoto in this game
[0:29:54] <Darren716> yes
[0:29:56] <+the22cstomp> terry is a shoto
[0:29:57] <brunoberserk> sagat is not a shoto , tessa also is not a shoto
[0:29:58] <townzzzzz> power dunk
[0:30:01] <+TungstenViper> no
[0:30:02] <+Underachiever_Mako> Kyo nah
[0:30:08] <+TungstenViper> Kyo is rekka
[0:30:10] <%SableS139a> @theanora1 It scored an Xbox port, but I'm not sure what other platforms SvC was ported to.
[0:30:14] <+Underachiever_Mako> Kyo doesn’t have fireball here
[0:30:15] <%gatorafan> I don't think of Zero as a shoto myself, but I do think of Terry as one
[0:30:19] <SHSLSpiritHunter> ... i feel like I'm thinking of the wrong shoto here.
[0:30:23] <+zxero01> I’m this game kyo no terry yes
[0:30:24] <this_guy_115> Kyo wss shoto until 96'
[0:30:34] <this_guy_115> Canonically switched to rekka
[0:30:35] <+Underachiever_Mako> yeah he WAS
[0:30:40] <@Solidus_113> 19.5 shotos
[0:30:42] <Solidnick18> yoooo
[0:30:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Shoto Power
[0:30:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> kyo aint a shoto is seems in this game
[0:30:47] <%gatorafan> Mai sometimes has a DP and sometimes doesn't
[0:30:51] <Solidnick18> terry slapping asses
[0:30:56] <+arknodem> Doesn't Athena have a DP?
[0:30:56] <%Parlux> EVERY ONE IS A SHOTO!
[0:30:57] <SomersaultJustice> this is reggie's world now
[0:30:58] <brunoberserk> shiki is not a shoto , fuck you
[0:31:00] <%SableS139a> K E K
[0:31:00] <%Parlux> SNK lost their minds
[0:31:07] <%SableS139a> OOPS, ALL SHOTOS
[0:31:14] <Arisato_II> What! All Shotos
[0:31:15] <andre11dr> Kyo being a shoto is kinda os a stretch
[0:31:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> violent ken
[0:31:17] <kairumustdie> this was the coolest mugen stage
[0:31:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> wait the boss characters are just playable?
[0:31:19] <Melzmaster75> Gotta love ShotoBrawl '03.
[0:31:24] <Solidnick18> boedgaaa
[0:31:28] <this_guy_115> And then they made their ACTUAL shoto the most busted shoto ever (takuma)
[0:31:30] <+BurningSaph> SNK vs. Capcom: Shoto Chaos
[0:31:33] <deafmelone> Kyo has a fireball sometimes sooo
[0:31:33] <+TungstenViper> Kyo and Shiki are debatable but yeah the shoto quota is crazy LUL
[0:31:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> and
[0:31:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:31:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEP
[0:31:44] <Solidnick18> all grapplers PogChamp
[0:31:46] <SHSLSpiritHunter> what do they mean by shoto, because I feel like I have the wrong definition here
[0:31:46] <%Parlux> Also wasn't it this game where violent ken was his first appearance.
[0:31:47] <Man_in_the_Red> not even Gief LUL
[0:31:47] <nmaten> best game
[0:31:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> HUGO ONLY GRAPPLER
[0:31:50] <Solidnick18> what
[0:31:51] <SomersaultJustice> OOPS ONE GRAPPLER

[0:31:57] <+TungstenViper> Earthquake?
[0:31:59] <andre11dr> Also Iori ,not really a shoto
[0:32:00] <%SableS139a> k e k
[0:32:04] <this_guy_115> Yeah violent ken starred here
[0:32:06] <+Underachiever_Mako> Earthquake is a grappler
[0:32:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> again, the bosses are just playable?
[0:32:09] <+SneakyBeaver102> Insane
[0:32:10] <Solidnick18> violent ken Kreygasm
[0:32:24] <%Parlux> I mean if your gonna have one grappler why wouldn't you have hugo
[0:32:33] <Arisato_II> SNK made Ken very aggresive
[0:32:50] <deafmelone> Can we just LOOK at Violent Ken's character render artwork
[0:32:53] <+TungstenViper> wasn't Violent Ken in the SF2 animated movie?
[0:32:54] <%SableS139a> Wait, I thought that Violent Ken first appeared in the SF anime movie, then SvC, and finally USF2.
[0:32:59] <%Parlux> he was
[0:33:04] <deafmelone> He has an AFRO
[0:33:05] <%Parlux> in the sf2 animated movie
[0:33:08] <%SaiyanShoto> SaiyanShoto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[0:33:09] <SHSLSpiritHunter> I'm always happy when fighting games have the names of the characters under their health so I can learn more
[0:33:16] <%SableS139a> Okay, so Viper & I aren't wrong. Good to know.
[0:33:29] <andre11dr> @arisato_ii You could say,they made him violent Kappa
[0:33:30] <%Parlux> but in game SNK did it first

[0:33:42] <%SableS139a> @Parlux Gotcha. Thanks fam
[0:33:46] <%SaiyanShoto> Violent Ken started from the street fighter 2 movie didn’t he then in Alpha?
[0:33:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> which version of the game is this that the bosses are just playable, cause, i thought they were locked
[0:33:54] <townzzzzz> chaos
[0:33:54] <fangovafang> I remember seein this game when I was younger but at da time I thought he was evil men like from Streeefighter online
[0:33:58] <SomersaultJustice> violent ken wasn't in alpha
[0:34:01] <soul4rce> im glad hugo is in svc
[0:34:07] <%SableS139a> Why is Violent Ken's dash so fucking sick?
[0:34:11] <%gatorafan> Ken: RAGE MODE
[0:34:14] <Arisato_II> Background looks like the intro from Vanquish
[0:34:15] <fangovafang> ken*
[0:34:15] <MagumaDono> It's a violent dash~
[0:34:16] <andre11dr> Backgrounds are really bad,because SNK was bankrupt
[0:34:18] <au_d3n> !
[0:34:20] <%Parlux> I think in the Alpha movie it was some goofy OC kid who was suffering from the dark hado
[0:34:30] <+TungstenViper> they're void of life
[0:34:41] <%Parlux> not ken for some reason
[0:34:43] <au_d3n> 👍🏻
[0:34:48] <soul4rce> I love sfxt
[0:34:53] <andre11dr> Also the music is lacking as well, KOF usually have great music
[0:34:58] <%Parlux> Wait why isn't ken affected by the dark Hado?

[0:36:47] <%Parlux> todo I mean
[0:37:16] <andre11dr> I would like Kasumi to come back, just change her design a little to make her more interesting
[0:37:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's fair
[0:37:26] <fangovafang> her counters CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:37:26] <SomersaultJustice> I like kasumi though
[0:37:33] <tesla93> Naw, don't mess with kasumi design...
[0:37:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> i was looking at hugo's movelist which in retrospect is pointless cause he's just fucking hugo
[0:37:43] <+TungstenViper> the counter punch is the Desperation move LUL
[0:37:43] <kairumustdie> does he have the autograph move in this game
[0:37:46] <%SableS139a> Kasumi's pretty cool, tbh
[0:37:52] <%Parlux> Parlux is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 4 in the channel!
[0:37:53] <%Parlux> Parlux gifted a Tier 1 sub to Nahkc!

[0:38:06] <+TatsuMakuu> damn i got hype when i saw the snk vs logo, but realize it was svc chaos
[0:38:10] <tesla93> Kasumi design is good the way it is, I guess just spice up her hakama a little bit?

[0:39:24] <%SableS139a> K E K
[0:39:26] <SpookyBeef7> SNK had a lot of really cool fucking ideas for characters in this game.

[0:39:52] <fangovafang> I hope robert comes out at da end lol
[0:40:02] <au_d3n> PrideLion

[0:40:05] <+TungstenViper> best music in the game
[0:40:06] <EGus0> Pick Ryo next
[0:40:06] <MagumaDono> Reverse raging demonnnnn
[0:40:12] <MagumaDono> I used to pull this out in MvC2 CONSTANTLY
[0:40:13] <MagumaDono> it's the best
[0:40:16] <kairumustdie> hell yeah, it's the SFvsMSH move
[0:40:18] <andre11dr> I think you need red meter
[0:40:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> you need maximum meter
[0:40:31] <andre11dr> Or red life
[0:40:31] <MagumaDono> YES
[0:40:32] <Arisato_II> That Robert guy may be the friends we made along the wHERE COMES A CHALLENGER
[0:40:36] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:40:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> or nevermind
[0:40:38] <YakumoYomi> Otoko Michi
[0:40:38] <+TungstenViper> Red life, name flashing
[0:40:38] <au_d3n> woolieT
[0:40:40] <SHSLSpiritHunter> I'm sorry whaaaaat

[0:40:50] <MagumaDono> The Marvel 2 move is like 75% raw

[0:40:55] <au_d3n> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:41:02] <MagumaDono> it does raw 50 to sentinel no less lol
[0:41:05] <MagumaDono> Godlike
[0:41:27] <%SableS139a> Dan is honestly the greatest. How can you hate this man?
[0:41:37] <EGus0> Ryo
[0:41:44] <anuchallengertwitch> It sucks that this is only one of two fighting games with MMZ Zero in it
[0:41:46] <%ekodrop> YELLOW BACKGROUND
[0:41:49] <EGus0> vs Dan
[0:41:50] <GeltonZ> Athena has an autograph move JUST like Dan's in SNK Gal's Fighter and I wanna know who ripped off who since both it and MvC2 came out the same year.
[0:41:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> watch him actually be
[0:41:53] <deafmelone> We gotta see some MIDNIGHT BLISS too

[0:42:31] <Pingo_Pasketti> Horny Time
[0:42:32] <ThatGuyThere03> Wait is that his voice?
[0:42:35] <wolvenelf> demon cradle
[0:42:35] <GeltonZ> Demitri is currently working on KOF All Star.
[0:42:36] <ThatGuyThere03> Was it always like that?
[0:42:36] <kairumustdie> fuck he looks SO GOOD
[0:42:37] <+TungstenViper> Best voice acting too
[0:42:37] <+arknodem> Isn't this where female terry came from?
[0:42:39] <%SableS139a> >tfw Demetri is cooler in SvC Chaos than he is in his home series.
[0:42:45] <Man_in_the_Red> man, this is a CLEAN Dimitri sprite
[0:42:48] <wolvenelf> such a cool name
[0:42:49] <%SableS139a> @arknodem Yessir!
[0:42:51] <duskfeather6578> fiwa!!
[0:42:54] <%Terrarp> woolieGIRLS

[0:43:02] <%gatorafan> This Dimitri goes HAM
[0:43:10] <Man_in_the_Red> and the last new sprite they'll get
[0:43:14] <%Livelinne> Oooooh this is the one that has THAT super homo-erotic dialogue right??? joofbAww PrideRise
[0:43:17] <DublinRage> is Dmitri voiced by the announcer?
[0:43:18] <Solidnick18> succcc
[0:43:20] <Arisato_II> ???????
[0:43:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:43:26] <%gatorafan> @spookybeef7, and also the last, right?
[0:43:27] <MagumaDono> Is SFV Seth just Midnight Bliss Seth
[0:43:27] <UltimateAzure> @DublinRage Yes
[0:43:30] <+BurningSaph> not gonna lie I would have liked to have seen an SNK morrigan
[0:43:34] <%Livelinne> BABYYYYY
[0:43:37] <%SableS139a> @Man_in_the_Red SvC Demitri was so fucking cool that Ohgaki did a Mugen resprite and rebalancing project just like he did for Lilith, and it's goddamn amazing.
[0:43:37] <MagumaDono> Since they also have Demon/Mad Cradle?
[0:43:38] <andre11dr> Iori because a Goth GF
[0:43:45] <DublinRage> @ultimateazure nice~
[0:43:51] <+froduck42> Dimitrti is off the Kinsy scale
[0:43:51] <Man_in_the_Red> @magumadono no its Seth X copying Juri
[0:43:56] <andre11dr> becomes*
[0:43:59] <AuraPaladin> wait is that just iori from that all-girls SNK game
[0:44:00] <+zanzibar_junker> Demitri voiced by Joe Higashi
[0:44:02] <%SableS139a> @BurningSaph I think someone's working on an SVC take on Morrigan for Mugen, tbh
[0:44:02] <+balouie> I miss darkstalkers
[0:44:02] <MagumaDono> @Man_in_the_Red I'm mostly joking lol
[0:44:06] <+TungstenViper> do fireball all buttons
[0:44:10] <MagumaDono> since Mad Cradle and Demon Cradle are the same move
[0:44:13] <+BurningSaph> @SableS139a yo that'd be fire
[0:44:18] <+PenGia> gotta git that iori follow up
[0:44:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Fun Fact: Demitri is voiced by Nobuyuki Hiyama in this game, aka Link
[0:44:24] <MagumaDono> lmao
[0:44:25] <Solidnick18> thank you
[0:44:26] <ThatGuyThere03> wait
[0:44:26] <MagumaDono> that's amazing
[0:44:36] <%gatorafan> @AlteisenReiseZ, waow
[0:44:46] <anuchallengertwitch> did they play Zero yet?
[0:44:50] <+Qsmash_> it's like that in VSav too
[0:44:51] <MagumaDono> not yet
[0:44:54] <Man_in_the_Red> shit now i cant unhear Link
[0:45:04] <Aydarkzero> GBA Zero PogChamp
[0:45:05] <Man_in_the_Red> the best Zero design
[0:45:10] <%Shardlab> Megaman Zero was awesome
[0:45:14] <MagumaDono> He kneed that flower to DEATH
[0:45:21] <anuchallengertwitch> @Shardlab hard agree
[0:45:24] <fangovafang> Cuz why not lol
[0:45:27] <%gatorafan> Woolie woolieVS Megaman Zero WHEN
[0:45:30] <YakumoYomi> MMZ Zero
[0:45:31] <%Parlux> yeah man GBA zero is wild
[0:45:37] <Solidnick18> oh man vega
[0:45:38] <Aydarkzero> @gatorafan YES PLEASE
[0:45:39] <+zanzibar_junker> Hiyami also did a lot of SNK voices
[0:45:41] <duskfeather6578> one of the coolest zeroes
[0:45:55] <kairumustdie> if they ever do CVS3/SVC2 I want this Zero back
[0:45:56] <%SableS139a> Zero busted here like he is in almost any fighting game he touches, but I can't hate him. MMZ Zero's fucking cool.
[0:45:58] <+TungstenViper> You can charge buffer all day
[0:46:13] <punk_ass_abe> why does it seem like zero is almost always busted in fighting games
[0:46:14] <anuchallengertwitch> @duskfeather6578 He and the Guardians should be in more crossover stuff
[0:46:22] <andre11dr> Everyone gets their own female designs for midnight bliss,also after losing to Athena or Red Devil they turn you into folklore bullshit witch is also unique for every character
[0:46:42] <MegaQuint> It's weird having Zero's triple slash be a Rekka here
[0:46:52] <Aydarkzero> the story for MMZ is also great
[0:46:56] <+Qsmash_> I noticed Zero doesn't have any voice lines
[0:46:58] <+TungstenViper> money. that's the hurry LUL
[0:46:58] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Shield Boomerang
[0:47:00] <tesla93> @GeltonZ MvSF had dan and that came out long before then lol
[0:47:05] <MagumaDono> I just keep hearing "Shoooo! Shooo!"
[0:47:13] <anuchallengertwitch> @MegaQuint isn't that how it works in the zero games?
[0:47:16] <soul4rce> zero is hol horse
[0:47:17] <duskfeather6578> bet that facts that would be sick
[0:47:25] <deafmelone> Athena turns you into a Animal, Aremmer turns you into a Demon
[0:47:29] <Solidnick18> um
[0:47:32] <YakumoYomi> If you wanna split hairs, I think Onimusha Blade Warriors was the first console game to have MMZ Zero (I think it came out a month before the PS2 version of this game)
[0:47:33] <Kofvscapcom> HU HA HUUUHHH
[0:47:51] <Kofvscapcom> X4 was a trip
[0:47:56] <%SableS139a> @BurningSaph Okay, so Metal Warrior & King of Fighters E are the folks responsible for SNK Morrigan. Look up "KOFE Morrigan Update 2", and you'll see how she turned out.
[0:48:01] <ELFucilaNeroIV> MMZ series has a great story
[0:48:02] <MegaQuint> @anuchallengertwitch Coming off his X series self having each slash being it's own button in later games, it's an odd thing to get used to
[0:48:24] <RaidenRising> the ass grab man
[0:48:26] <%Parlux> shit how do I run games in fightcade I forgot
[0:48:29] <duskfeather6578> @anuchchallengertwicth that should happen marvel is not stiff with characters
[0:48:31] <+TungstenViper> Best terry animtions and voice acting
[0:48:34] <%Parlux> I'm gonna try to give woolie these hands
[0:48:36] <tesla93> Lol, that line was actually pretty good by balrog
[0:48:37] <YakumoYomi> "Toosh"? Did they mean "touche"?
[0:48:38] <MagumaDono> Ohhh they brought that punch into SFV
[0:48:41] <Solidnick18> ass slappin terry
[0:48:45] <MainManJonadiah> Yo, that's a sick looking Balrog sprite
[0:48:45] <Aydarkzero> ha
[0:48:52] <RaidenRising> do the ass slap terry
[0:48:53] <%gatorafan> THERE IS NO TIME
[0:48:57] <kairumustdie> dirty boxer vs sex pervert
[0:48:58] <MagumaDono> lmao slap his ASS terry
[0:49:02] <fangovafang> headbutt dp lol
[0:49:02] <%SableS139a> Why does Balrog look so much cooler here?

[0:49:14] <RaidenRising> SLAP WOLF
[0:49:25] <YakumoYomi> Clap them cheeks...literally.
[0:49:28] <MagumaDono> LMAO poppped
[0:49:37] <andre11dr> Man ,that sprite is the same Terry sprite they've been using since 94 ,and you thought Morigan was bad
[0:49:38] <Pingo_Pasketti> Do Terry’s weird Deadly Rave
[0:49:44] <%gatorafan> Terry only slaps "Marie Rose age" ladies' asses. Kappa
[0:49:45] <huskarl_zap> its been a minute
[0:49:50] <HelluvaNohbody> Nothing bad ever happens to the Bogaurds
[0:49:53] <kairumustdie> nah, the '94 terry sprite looked worse
[0:49:56] <kairumustdie> they've updated it a few times
[0:50:04] <kairumustdie> they even used his garou design after 2002
[0:50:11] <+TungstenViper> This Terry is weird too as he has some Garou animations and voice lines
[0:50:29] <%SableS139a> @gatorafan To be fair, Marie's 18. Problem is that she's got nothing to speak of, so...
[0:50:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:50:34] <%SaiyanShoto> That timer is on Dragon Ball Z time

[0:50:55] <%SvenHolgersson> DONT LET HIM DO YOU DIRTY
[0:50:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Well, SNK was pretty much broke at the time they made this
[0:51:03] <andre11dr> Wait yeah, why didn't they just use the Garou version here, they were using it for KOF
[0:51:06] <duskfeather6578> terry is a mix pf 94, 97 and garou in this game its werid looking sprite
[0:51:18] <kairumustdie> same reason they've got schoolboy kyo here
[0:51:25] <Solidnick18> shiki Kreygasm
[0:51:30] <SomersaultJustice> yeyeye mars ppl

[0:51:52] <Arisato_II> I love you mars people
[0:51:56] <+TungstenViper> Battle Colosseum feels more like a true corssover game than this. so weird...

[0:52:08] <FeralRageGaming> what's Aqua from Kingdom Hearts doing here?
[0:52:14] <brunoberserk> i want mars people in KOF XV
[0:52:16] <kairumustdie> yeah we wilding
[0:52:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Seeing as we have Red Earth, Darkstalkers, and Samsho, Metal Slug is kind of a shoe-in
[0:52:23] <ryanccurtis> Oh yeah. This is Geese's theme remixed btw
[0:52:23] <Solidnick18> that grab
[0:52:27] <GeltonZ> @TungstenViper Agreed. It feels more like Match of the Millenium on console than SVC Chaos does.
[0:52:27] <Arisato_II> So his death animation is a move
[0:52:30] <SomersaultJustice> mars ppl is a grappler confirmed
[0:52:34] <bazz_tv> NG Battle Colliseum has Marco from Metal Slug too
[0:52:37] <andre11dr> Didn't the Mars People become heroes that fight Nazis later on?
[0:52:48] <duskfeather6578> @TungstenViper true
[0:52:50] <@Solidus_113> no the opposite

[1:00:28] <Redvc> The music in this game is pretty ass. Which is a shame since KOF games usually have great music. Well, besides KOF 2001,02, and 03.
[1:00:28] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ThatsMyTrunks
[1:01:04] <+TungstenViper> @ThatsMyTrunks that is amazing LUL

[1:02:48] <+TungstenViper> Hugo is straight from SF3
[1:02:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ino-Shika-Cho? ISN'T THAT A NARUTO REFERENCE
[1:02:58] <fernandapsdois> hugo has 3s parries
[1:02:59] <deafmelone> Literal sf3 sprite with snk coat of paint
[1:03:06] <+ThatsMyTrunks> It's a shame Haohmaru isn't in this.
[1:03:20] <+ThatsMyTrunks> Genjyuro is rad but man.
[1:03:23] <kairumustdie> I think his sprite has been squished a bit though
[1:03:28] <+ProfessorThorgi> 21 raiders from ProfessorThorgi have joined!
[1:03:28] <andre11dr> I think that's his Samsho V sprite, but it somehow has less animation
[1:03:29] <%SvenHolgersson> Whose Naruto? Is he related to Boruto
[1:03:32] <%Frubblord> dont you mean Hanafuda?
[1:03:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Tee-hee-hee
[1:03:58] <bazz_tv> @alteisenreisez pretty sure Genjuro pre-dates Naruto
[1:04:05] <Arisato_II> Always bet on sword
[1:04:10] <+TungstenViper> he has Double Impact voice too iirc
[1:04:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @bazz_tv It's a joke yo
[1:04:16] <%gatorafan> Is Mahjong a Naruto reference? Kappa
[1:04:21] <$Jasuchin> I was always more of a Haohmaru guy. He was absolutely broken in NeoGeo Battle Colosseum
[1:04:21] <SomersaultJustice> I wish there was a fighter that fought with mahjong hands
[1:04:23] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:04:24] <ryanccurtis> Poke
[1:04:24] <andre11dr> Genjiro is like 93 or something

[1:04:42] <fernandapsdois> try out hugo's parries
[1:05:01] <+ThatsMyTrunks> I played SNK vs Capcom for NGPC for the first time this year and what an incredible little game.
[1:05:02] <SomersaultJustice> I thought she just uses sa staff?
[1:05:10] <ryanccurtis> GOTTEM!
[1:05:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Her move names are Mahjong hands
[1:05:14] <SomersaultJustice> END
[1:05:17] <Arisato_II> Death
[1:05:19] <SomersaultJustice> ohhh I see
[1:05:20] <ryanccurtis> WHAT A FINISH!!!
[1:05:24] <+TungstenViper> PogChamp
[1:05:26] <%SvenHolgersson> POISON lytBLUSH
[1:05:36] <bazz_tv> churn dat butter
[1:05:53] <+heyitsdenzel_> bison jacking off so hard
[1:05:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> look at him go
[1:05:56] <SomersaultJustice> do the dumb swoop!
[1:06:01] <kairumustdie> was this the proto mvc3
[1:06:09] <+ThatsMyTrunks> God that Bison Jerk
[1:06:11] <+ThatsMyTrunks> So good
[1:06:21] <kairumustdie> also worst bison ever right here
[1:06:27] <+Qsmash_> Red Arremer's summons are broken
[1:06:37] <ryanccurtis> Arremer has a good victory animation.
[1:06:46] <UltimateDomon> Is there a difference between Red Arremer and Firebrand?
[1:06:47] <+ThatsMyTrunks> Bison looks so skinny in this
[1:06:53] <%SableS139a> Yeah, Firebrand & Athena are secret bosses. FB for Hell & Athena for Heaven.
[1:06:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Nah, they're the same
[1:06:59] <SomersaultJustice> YEYEYE
[1:07:06] <+TungstenViper> also the charge partitioning is really weird in this game
[1:07:08] <%gatorafan> Woolie needs to make the KOF lore series for Reggie Kappa
[1:07:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> OH GOD THIS GAME
[1:07:14] <kairumustdie> I remember that attack from Ghosts and Goblins stage 1
[1:07:16] <kairumustdie> the horror
[1:07:17] <ryanccurtis> He is an SNK Boss after
[1:07:22] <deafmelone> Red Arremer is the name of Firebrand's race, this isnt firebrand
[1:07:23] <bazz_tv> I like this Bison, I like he has the SF EX knee press nightmare
[1:07:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hi guys
[1:07:54] <Arisato_II> Ah yes, my favorite move, the diveAAAAAAAAA
[1:07:56] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[1:07:57] <bazz_tv> but lacks the "paint the fence" move from cvs1 and 2
[1:07:57] <andre11dr> Wat a random ass pick ,some dude from and old Nes game
[1:07:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:08:05] <GeltonZ> @TungstenViper Charge characters in general are fucked in this game. Poor Vega is un-fucking-playable.
[1:08:06] <%gatorafan> Reggie hasn't even unlocked the summons
[1:08:08] <%Parlux> I got fightcade working, Woolie, Regie come get dez hands you scrublords!
[1:08:15] <wolvenelf> Put Kings Dont Kneel on my vegeta shirt
[1:08:15] <KumaTorey> "bosses don't kneel" oddly prophetic words
[1:08:19] <SomersaultJustice> pansy foe
[1:08:23] <+TungstenViper> @GeltonZ yeah
[1:08:31] <bazz_tv> @andre11dr Firebrand had 3 games of his own too
[1:08:38] <$Jasuchin> Nanto Ho-oh ken has no defensive stance!
[1:08:49] <andre11dr> Oh right Demons Crest
[1:08:56] <bazz_tv> and Gargoyle Quest 1 and 2
[1:08:58] <andre11dr> Still random
[1:09:07] <+Qsmash_> "put em up" -Ryu
[1:09:08] <+Harro8> cum ryu
[1:09:08] <+TenguGemini> hot take: 4 button > 6 button
[1:09:09] <KumaTorey> Ty Guhhh
[1:09:10] <%SilverDevilfish> "Ryu have you been fighting other people."
[1:09:11] <fernandapsdois> sf1 sagat
[1:09:13] <SomersaultJustice> blue tiger shots is weird
[1:09:14] <extradopeness> I mean, demons crest exists
[1:09:27] <%generalve> so why is capcom vs SNK good while SNK vs capcom sucks ?
[1:09:32] <extradopeness> Oh
[1:09:33] <%gatorafan> TAIGA
[1:09:36] <ryanccurtis> When you win with Arremer and Athena, the opponent gets transformed into a demon or an animal. Some of them pretty funny
[1:09:37] <fernandapsdois> snk was being experimental
[1:09:45] <bazz_tv> also he always appear in Ghost n' goblins/maikamura games
[1:09:46] <KumaTorey> sagat shooting blue, ryu shooting orange fire WutFace what is this game!?!
[1:09:46] <+ThatsMyTrunks> Neither of them suck, they both are best in class.
[1:09:55] <+ThatsMyTrunks> They're just very different classes
[1:09:58] <deafmelone> snk was broke at this time
[1:10:07] <$Jasuchin> Man, Capcom's characters look so cool in SNK's dark artstyle
[1:10:11] <wolvenelf> that animationnwas silly
[1:10:11] <+Qsmash_> this game was a last ditch effort kind of situation
[1:10:15] <+StrawberryPantsu> TIMED
[1:10:21] <SomersaultJustice> sagat has like no neck
[1:10:21] <+TungstenViper> and it whiffs on hit LUL
[1:10:21] <%gatorafan> ngl, despite all the issues this game has I really like how most Capcom characters look here daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:10:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> GET THAT ASS TIMED
[1:10:28] <bazz_tv> good ol' Saget
[1:10:37] <+Qsmash_> NGBC feels more like what SvC should have been
[1:11:04] <+TenguGemini> this is the SFxT of snk fighters
[1:11:13] <%generalve> the sound effects seems more real
[1:11:15] <deafmelone> Imaginr NGBC with CAPCOM characters added
[1:11:25] <$Jasuchin> NGBC is severely underrated
[1:11:32] <bazz_tv> true, svc on the neo geo pocket was better imo
[1:11:37] <soul4rce> ngbc has some cool ass characters
[1:11:38] <andre11dr> Spiking of random picks, i forgot the witch from Red Earth was in this
[1:11:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:42] <+patrickng714> @deafmelone it was called Capcom Fighting Jam Kappa
[1:11:47] <+ThatsMyTrunks> This is the Capcom Fighting Evolution of SNK fighters.
[1:11:48] <bazz_tv> it had a better roster too
[1:11:49] <SomersaultJustice> someone pick tessa pls
[1:11:56] <lem______> athena time
[1:12:02] <+StrawberryPantsu> LMAO
[1:12:11] <+TungstenViper> yeah, Fighting Jam is on the same level as this one
[1:12:12] <+jiggy_snipe> as if Akuma kills people? Kappa
[1:12:26] <+patrickng714> i do wish they continued to make Neo Geo Battle Colisseum
[1:12:33] <+StrawberryPantsu> Akuma and Elena are best buds
[1:12:38] <andre11dr> @tungstenviper I think fighting jam is worst
[1:12:50] <+schlager087> anyone know of any Shodo's in this game?
[1:12:53] <bazz_tv> that is some Spiderman the animated series levels of speeded up dialogue
[1:12:53] <andre11dr> This at least has a good roaster
[1:12:55] <+patrickng714> best i am hoping now is a World Heroes team in KOFXV
[1:12:56] <+TungstenViper> @andre11dr actually, yes.
[1:12:59] <+JoePReal> Please let Akuma win so we get the Smacking a Baby winquote
[1:13:00] <+schlager087> or shoto's sorry i'm a scrub
[1:13:06] <CyberEne> onlinr of this is gonna be wild
[1:13:07] <Arisato_II> ThewheeloffateisturningRevelOneFIGHT
[1:13:13] <SomersaultJustice> fighting jam had the dinosaur at least
[1:13:15] <soul4rce> put erick in another game! and rasputin!
[1:13:24] <deafmelone> @joepreal THIS
[1:13:31] <bazz_tv> this game has so many shotos
[1:13:49] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> That did so much damage
[1:13:57] <$Jasuchin> Traditional Japanese martial arts vs Demon infused ridiculousness
[1:13:59] <+patrickng714> fun fact about Fighting Jam, they originally planned to include Retsu, SF1 Sagat, and Eagle
[1:14:01] <Arisato_II> Death
[1:14:20] <deafmelone> @patrickng714 why didnt they?
[1:14:27] <bazz_tv> casually messatsu the girl
[1:14:33] <andre11dr> Do it regular judo girl, you can beat this demon LUL
[1:14:42] <%SableS139a> CFJ was originally planned to be a 3D arena fighter with additional characters from Ingrid's faction, too, right?
[1:14:47] <+schlager087> my only memories of this game is trying to get good with Zero, Violent Ken, and the cast is like 90% shotos
[1:14:51] <deafmelone> @sables139a yes
[1:14:56] <SomersaultJustice> I remember fighting all stars, it was gonna have charlie in it
[1:14:56] <soul4rce> is kasumi considered a punch girl
[1:14:58] <+TungstenViper> YO
[1:15:04] <$Jasuchin> Traditional japanese martial arts wins
[1:15:05] <+patrickng714> @deafmelone time constraints Kappa
[1:15:07] <SunsetJack> You only get one exceed.
[1:15:19] <SomersaultJustice> yeyeye red earth
[1:15:23] <+shan89> her dad is in CVS2
[1:15:25] <andre11dr> @soul4rce No ,she's a judo fighter
[1:15:25] <bazz_tv> to be fair even the ngpc SVC game has a lot of shotos
[1:15:26] <+MisterRaffles> Actually, he is a character in CVS.
[1:15:32] <soul4rce> damn
[1:15:32] <+TenguGemini> Wait how many shotos *are* in this game?
[1:15:34] <+TungstenViper> WARZARD needs a comeback with Darkstalkers
[1:15:36] <andre11dr> More of a toss girl
[1:15:41] <%Xero_J> I really only know her from Pocket Fighter
[1:15:51] <powerprotoman> Yeah tessa! love her design
[1:15:54] <+patrickng714> @deafmelone they did show sprites they did for them
[1:16:02] <$Jasuchin> Those beeps at the start of each fight make me think my digimon is complaining at me
[1:16:11] <+balouie> where is tessa from I never knew
[1:16:16] <+balouie> even though I owned this game
[1:16:16] <SomersaultJustice> I did : (
[1:16:22] <deafmelone> Tessa is cool
[1:16:27] <PKSomething> @balouie from red earth
[1:16:28] <%Shardlab> I know Tessa only from Pocket Fighter
[1:16:30] <+patrickng714> they need to re-release Red Earth on digital platforms
[1:16:32] <bazz_tv> Tessa is from Red Earth aka Warzard
[1:16:33] <powerprotoman> so what your saying is Get into fighting games Red earth when
[1:16:33] <%SableS139a> @deafmelone As much as I legit like Ingrid, I wish that her faction got more love officially. CFJ has a lot of potential, and it just fell through for whatever reason.
[1:16:36] <andre11dr> Nobody played Red Earth
[1:16:38] <+ThatsMyTrunks> woolieF
[1:16:39] <SomersaultJustice> I used to use mai ling
[1:16:47] <%Abstract_Endurance> Abstract_Endurance subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[1:16:48] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> ??
[1:16:50] <+roysharkxr3> There's actually a group of dudes who play red earth and revive it
[1:16:51] <%ZeroCruz> Farts
[1:16:51] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Understandable
[1:17:00] <soul4rce> red earth is neat
[1:17:00] <%hologram_sam> dies while teleporting, makes sense
[1:17:00] <bazz_tv> I played Red Earth, but I remember shit all about it
[1:17:00] <+balouie> yeah I never heard of red earth
[1:17:02] <deafmelone> @sables139a im still salty i cant play as D.D.
[1:17:05] <HelluvaNohbody> Red Earth is a weird game
[1:17:10] <+ThatsMyTrunks> Double Dragon?
[1:17:11] <+MisterRaffles> Red Earth was known enough to be in Capcom Fighting Evolution
[1:17:11] <SomersaultJustice> I honestly want red earth to come back and be more fleshed out from a single player perspective
[1:17:12] <%SableS139a> I need to play Red Earth at some point. I've only read the manga adaptation so far.
[1:17:12] <+patrickng714> Red Earth was a boss rush
[1:17:13] <UltimateDomon> How similar is Red Earth to their DnD games?
[1:17:16] <bazz_tv> is like a Fighting game rpg
[1:17:17] <+TungstenViper> Warzard had a straight campaign
[1:17:32] <UltimateDomon> Gives off the same vibes
[1:17:42] <deafmelone> Is there a boss hack for Red Earth?
[1:17:45] <andre11dr> The dinosaur was cool
[1:17:46] <+Qsmash_> it's a 2D fighting game instead of beat em up
[1:17:46] <soul4rce> cant you use your leveled characters in vs battles
[1:17:47] <+roysharkxr3> there's a group of dudes who play and revive red earth
[1:17:47] <+patrickng714> Red Earth had cool designs
[1:17:57] <powerprotoman> Time to look up red earth info
[1:17:58] <+Qsmash_> so it feels pretty differently off the bat
[1:17:59] <andre11dr> Bring him back for Marvel
[1:18:02] <bazz_tv> tbh I remember more about Star Gladiator/ Plasma Sword than Red Earth
[1:18:04] <aquatic_lotus> such a beautiful guard sprite
[1:18:07] <%Parlux> Im labing waiting to give woolie these hands
[1:18:21] <%Parlux> its been 10 years tho since I played this soooo

[1:18:28] <%Parlux> Lets see wat happuns
[1:18:33] <%Xero_J> So far, one thing I've seen this game do very well is toothy grins, cause look at this smug mother
[1:18:51] <%ZeroCruz> is this the one that has Megaman Zero ?
[1:18:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:52] <+Qsmash_> Red Earth is pretty much just boss fights and you got a password when losing to keep your progress
[1:19:13] <mecha_soul> ^
[1:19:13] <SomersaultJustice> quickly, write down this 20 digit password to save your red earth character
[1:19:14] <+TopTieramisu> it does have zero iirc

[1:19:17] <bazz_tv> @zerocruz yes, cyber elves and all

[1:22:44] <andre11dr> And is different pose
[1:22:47] <bazz_tv> deadly rave is easier to land lol
[1:22:48] <+TenguGemini> *jin

[1:22:52] <SomersaultJustice> yes
[1:22:55] <soul4rce> its from real bout
[1:22:55] <+TenguGemini> stupid voice to text
[1:23:09] <+TopTieramisu> street fighter vs chaos
[1:23:14] <SomersaultJustice> I remember it's hard to do in this game
[1:23:16] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, it wave version

[1:23:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> let us in
[1:23:44] <SomersaultJustice> ATHENA
[1:23:49] <bazz_tv> ah yes this game has weird charge motion timing
[1:23:50] <Doublemint_Dave_> So why is it I never hear about this game compared to say CVS
[1:23:51] <duskfeather6578> @deafmelone k
[1:23:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> let the scrubs and killers in
[1:23:59] <andre11dr> However, this is still better than SFxT LUL
[1:23:59] <+TopTieramisu> because it sucks in comparison
[1:24:11] <bazz_tv> is the Kaiser Knuckle problem
[1:24:17] <+TopTieramisu> snk really half-assed their side of the collab
[1:24:24] <soul4rce> DanKuGa is great
[1:24:29] <duskfeather6578> @deafmelone k' needed to be in Cvs2 it would of made sense
[1:24:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Doublemint_Dave_ cause this game is weird and a broken mess and just isn't as good
[1:24:32] <%Livelinne> PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise
[1:24:38] <bazz_tv> @toptieramisu they had no money
[1:24:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I think my favorite interaction in this game is Iori vs Mai, where Iori says, and I quote "Get thee to a nunnery!"
[1:24:54] <+TopTieramisu> @bazz_tv i'd believe it. they've been bought out how many times?
[1:24:54] <andre11dr> Yea, they were basically bankrupt
[1:25:03] <willg1222> i just wish CvS2 had ANY nests saga characters in it
[1:25:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> fucking chip
[1:25:14] <%Xero_J> Evo moment 37 this ain't
[1:25:21] <andre11dr> @toptieramisu I think 3
[1:25:24] <soul4rce> Maxima in cvs2 woulda been cool
[1:25:31] <duskfeather6578> @willg1222 facts i also wanted that
[1:25:36] <andre11dr> No wait maybe 2
[1:25:46] <+Axle_Bro> Surprized youre not playing +r
[1:25:48] <+PenGia> do the axe chop
[1:25:58] <andre11dr> Once by Playmore and once by the China
[1:25:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:26:07] <Daxalog> Is this the game with the TV ui?
[1:26:08] <CyberEne> im gonna die
[1:26:11] <Zayasu> @Axle_Bro why would woolie play the popular thing Kappa
[1:26:13] <fuji_92> let's go wake up super
[1:26:22] <deafmelone> K, Angel,Vanessa,Ramon all would of fit in cvs2
[1:26:27] <+TopTieramisu> @andre11dr what about eolith?
[1:26:31] <+Qsmash_> why is Chun-li caked up like that?
[1:26:31] <%marrs_bars> Suplex! PogChamp
[1:26:45] <andre11dr> Oh so i was right, that's 3
[1:26:55] <%Parlux> SNK style sprites on capcom fighters is kino
[1:27:01] <deafmelone> I'd replace todo with k honestly. and i dont dislike him either
[1:27:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> THAT SUPER DOES SO MUCH DAMAGE
[1:27:14] <CyberEne> online time
[1:27:15] <soul4rce> ramon would fit into sf4 betyer because hes just elfuerte
[1:27:21] <+PenGia> KYOKUGEN RULES
[1:27:22] <@Menitta> haha I dont
[1:27:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> wait
[1:27:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> fightcade?
[1:27:31] <bazz_tv> rekka ranbu never gets old
[1:27:40] <%SableS139a> Welp, the floodgates are about to open
[1:27:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> if you're on fightcade yeah i'm not doing that.
[1:28:00] <@Menitta> Geese wasnt weird at all tho
[1:28:01] <+TopTieramisu> negan is weird af
[1:28:08] <@Menitta> Negan IS an actor
[1:28:12] <Zayasu> fuck negan LUL
[1:28:17] <+jiggy_snipe> Negan is weird but still fictional
[1:28:24] <bazz_tv> you double Negan
[1:28:29] <soul4rce> can anyone challenge on fightcade or is it subs only
[1:28:32] <+Mrhennybottle> Geese and Akuma were hyped. Noctis was odd. Negan was just "what the fuck"
[1:28:35] <+TopTieramisu> snk ladies are top tier
[1:28:38] <%MrPizzaPasta> MrPizzaPasta subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Woolie R U OK???
[1:28:40] <@Menitta> anyone can challenge'
[1:28:44] <soul4rce> oh neat
[1:28:49] <%j0hnnydonuts> put captain crunch im guilty gear strive
[1:28:57] <soul4rce> imma wait till matrimelee then
[1:28:59] <willg1222> Negan feels like a Mortal Kombat guest character
[1:29:02] <andre11dr> SNK has some top shelf waifus
[1:29:04] <%kyun_dere> aw man fightcade
[1:29:06] <+TopTieramisu> @willg1222 he does
[1:29:08] <soul4rce> catch this chinnen
[1:29:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> finally get parsec working and you go and play on the other service with that toxic ass group
[1:29:16] <+TopTieramisu> negan would fit right in with terminator and rambo
[1:29:16] <Kei_Ar_> if fightcade would allow me to properly use roms id be playing tonight
[1:29:16] <@Menitta> why does automod hate the word waifu lmao
[1:29:21] <deafmelone> Spider-Man and Naruto for Tekken 7
[1:29:29] <SomersaultJustice> waifu
[1:29:34] <+TopTieramisu> naruto is already in tekken
[1:29:34] <@Menitta> it wont hold it now
[1:29:35] <+roysharkxr3> Power Instinct Ume for tekken
[1:29:39] <+TopTieramisu> his name is lars
[1:29:44] <%kyun_dere> fightcade 2 won't install properly on my pc so i guess i won't be hopping in wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[1:29:48] <soul4rce> power instinct white for buffs
[1:29:52] <+Mrhennybottle> oh yea, lars was in a naruto game
[1:29:54] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Man, Ryu would never say he'd kick someones but nowadays
[1:29:59] <+roysharkxr3> white is always gonna be low tier bruv
[1:30:02] <+Qsmash_> suprisingly, Dan isn't the worst character in the game. Bison is.
[1:30:04] <undercoverbarber> Canon atpGasm
[1:30:09] <@Menitta> the creak stage was really nice
[1:30:16] <soul4rce> buff white and give chinnen a shoryuken
[1:30:28] <bazz_tv> that is so more agresive than Ryu's regular dialogue
[1:30:32] <+roysharkxr3> boy he's already got one
[1:30:46] <+ThatsMyTrunks> Oh shit, I just remembered I can play this on the MiSTer
[1:30:50] <soul4rce> give him another
[1:31:06] <@Menitta> looked like they were typing
[1:31:12] <+TopTieramisu> he was gaming too hard
[1:31:17] <bazz_tv> lol at the whiffed knee press nightmare
[1:31:17] <townzzzzz> got too hyped
[1:31:19] <+roysharkxr3> now we get to see the wonderful bison idle
[1:31:20] <soul4rce> kazuya in dankuga has 2
[1:31:21] <Solidnick18> woooo old games
[1:31:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> fightcade isn't great
[1:31:24] <+TungstenViper> how? LUL
[1:31:25] <+Qsmash_> how does one 'break your controls'?
[1:31:29] <%Livelinne> joofbScared
[1:31:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you have to hold fightstick gently like borgar
[1:31:30] <%kyun_dere> he forgot his gamer chair
[1:31:32] <+TopTieramisu> he went ham on that fightstick like the little kid that faced daigo
[1:31:39] <+jiggy_snipe> his controls or controller?
[1:31:41] <Solidnick18> um
[1:31:53] <%Parlux> sorry
[1:31:54] <%kyun_dere> StickThrow
[1:32:02] <HelluvaNohbody> Broke his 8 gate?
[1:32:24] <+TopTieramisu> athena LUL
[1:32:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> bison sucks in this game
[1:32:27] <CyberEne> ill pick athena
[1:32:32] <CyberEne> im playing hr
[1:32:33] <+TopTieramisu> athena is the true SNK boss of this game
[1:32:38] <%temuginKhang> temuginKhang subscribed with Prime.
[1:32:38] <SomersaultJustice> yeyeye athena
[1:32:48] <@Menitta> I find it so weird I love Athena in KOF2002 but hate her in every other game
[1:32:51] <crob_og> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:32:54] <lem______> too bad athena is a bad char...
[1:33:02] <+TopTieramisu> athena is ear cancer
[1:33:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1320951939224555520?s=20
[1:33:11] <@Menitta> PSYCHOBAAAAAALL
[1:33:20] <+TopTieramisu> terepottooooo
[1:33:25] <lem______> wrong one lol
[1:33:29] <+Kyanta_Rojo> Firebrand is also nuts in this game
[1:33:38] <tesla93> PychoooSwooordo!
[1:33:39] <+Kyanta_Rojo> his standard projectile goes through basically everything
[1:33:40] <duskfeather6578> i love 2002 and 2001 andy and athena but hate in any others game other than 14
[1:33:43] <@Menitta> Bison and Athena canon have the same powers
[1:33:48] <+Kyanta_Rojo> and he can summon assists that just stay on screen forever
[1:34:03] <andre11dr> I know, i really like that KOF Ken is actually just straight up an evil asshole rather than the rival bullshit
[1:34:17] <+Kyanta_Rojo> But yeah this Athena ain't KoF Athena. It's her ancient Ancestor who is a God.
[1:34:23] <bazz_tv> at least Bison os good in cvs2
[1:34:29] <bazz_tv> is*
[1:34:30] <tesla93> @andre11dr I mean he's the ken from the SF animated movie
[1:34:51] <+TopTieramisu> norio wakamoto as bison though Kreygasm
[1:34:59] <@Menitta> I can at least appreciate Athena getting a new design every game
[1:35:08] <soul4rce> @toptieramisu bruh nice name
[1:35:11] <%Parlux> respect
[1:35:13] <TheSaltminer> Chiyo's Father getting bodied
[1:35:15] <+TopTieramisu> @soul4rce SeemsGood
[1:35:15] <tesla93> I like athena, I just hate her voice
[1:35:23] <+Kyanta_Rojo> Ken ain't evil in this game. Violent Ken is one that M. Bison did brainwash but he comes to his senses after Ryu fights him for a bit (it's in the SF II movie)
[1:35:32] <%Parlux> I got 2 rounds
[1:35:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> welp, i'm going back to parsec
[1:35:38] <bazz_tv> Athena will never be as bad as Ingrid at least
[1:35:44] <@Menitta> ready to lose
[1:35:44] <CyberEne> ello
[1:35:53] <soul4rce> good luck menitta
[1:35:58] <soul4rce> who you play?
[1:36:02] <%Parlux> Were 2 and 2
[1:36:04] <CyberEne> oh i
[1:36:30] <fernandapsdois> this game invented nrs intros
[1:36:35] <andre11dr> It's terrible
[1:36:43] <%temuginKhang> this stage is pretty much the akagi opening
[1:36:59] <+TopTieramisu> genjyuro, the samurai iori
[1:37:05] <andre11dr> 96 has backgrounds that look years ahead of this game
[1:37:08] <duskfeather6578> do guys think kof 15 is real
[1:37:13] <+Qsmash_> I like how the desolate future stages are never explained
[1:37:18] <andre11dr> I hope it is
[1:37:27] <+TopTieramisu> kof 15 is gonna come out at the same time as the next asoiaf novel
[1:37:29] <Solidnick18> bingooo
[1:37:29] <savetitania> Wonder why this game is Techno/Inudstrial hell?
[1:37:33] <seaechiowai> @duskfeather6578 yes, they announced it
[1:37:42] <savetitania> It's not SNK's or Capcoms thing
[1:37:47] <lem______> did someone play athena yet?
[1:38:02] <+TopTieramisu> buster wolf is the best
[1:38:03] <CyberEne> im going to
[1:38:07] <%temuginKhang> did anyone play mars people
[1:38:12] <lem______> get in there for me cyer
[1:38:16] <duskfeather6578> it was reveal tralier but nothing happen after evo 2109
[1:38:20] <duskfeather6578> 2019
[1:38:30] <andre11dr> Isn't it in 14? The overshoot?
[1:38:47] <bazz_tv> yeah it is in 14
[1:38:50] <@Menitta> GG!
[1:38:59] <seaechiowai> if they ever bring overshift geyser, I hope they make it an otg extension
[1:39:02] <bazz_tv> what is dead is the classic triple geiser
[1:39:16] <@Menitta> that was way closer than I expected it to be
[1:39:20] <+beatsinmyhead99> i don't think we're getting anything until either tgs or evo 2022
[1:39:24] <bazz_tv> now he just does the 3 geisers in a single motion
[1:39:26] <seaechiowai> so buster wolf could be a launcher and osg would be otg
[1:39:31] <andre11dr> I think they game give him overshoot and Buster Wolf in 14
[1:39:35] <CyberEne> yeah
[1:39:46] <andre11dr> They should keep it like that in the future
[1:39:56] <soul4rce> so is there a player queue or do we just challenge
[1:40:01] <@Menitta> Ah I didnt know that
[1:40:06] <bazz_tv> in FEXL he has everything
[1:40:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:40:33] <seaechiowai> fexl terry seems awesome
[1:40:33] <CyberEne> oh thers athna
[1:40:43] <Doublemint_Dave_> ~Nude Place~
[1:40:43] <CyberEne> there she was
[1:40:49] <andre11dr> Also they should give Geese his 360 back if he's in 15
[1:40:52] <seaechiowai> I don't have the game tho
[1:40:55] <bazz_tv> FEXL Terry is op as fuck too
[1:41:24] <savetitania> GOD, this sounds like Nidhogg music!
[1:41:30] <deafmelone> Ken is voiced by Ralf in this game
[1:41:33] <savetitania> THAT'S what it reminded me of
[1:41:41] <andre11dr> I like the 360 more than the counter super
[1:42:05] <%Malik1002> Malik1002 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! man 6 months of fun with the boys but you know i was looking at the anime side and the playlist showed somthing to me that was also about 6 months. So in boruto right kabuto in his snake form just runs an orphanage even though he reanimated everyone.
[1:42:06] <bazz_tv> Townz should had picked violent Ken
[1:42:30] <+TopTieramisu> man, nidhogg... that's one of the few games that got a lot uglier when they updated its graphics
[1:42:49] <+mans51> LUL
[1:42:49] <+Qsmash_> oof

[1:50:14] <+Kyanta_Rojo> to be fair they did balance Athena (old) in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum
[1:50:20] <%SableS139a> Asamiya's the reincarnation of Goddess Athena in SNK lore, correct?
[1:50:24] <+jetjagger222> uruk-hai sagat
[1:50:29] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo everyone in Hades is Fuckin'and Simpin' all over the place
[1:50:33] <andre11dr> I think KOF Athena is reincarnation of this Athena

[1:50:37] <+Qsmash_> @SableS139a yeah
[1:50:38] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:50:38] <%Jetzord> What did they do to Sagat?

[1:51:02] <Solidnick18> i miss rage
[1:51:03] <trickquestionz> Woolie do you want to be known for picking boss characters or known for stealing pies?
[1:51:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> >is your Sagat black or normal
[1:51:12] <+jiggy_snipe> remember how Woolie stole pies then killed that guy with a boss character
[1:51:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheSaltminer
[1:51:13] <@Menitta> yo this game is legit fun
[1:51:23] <duskfeather6578> SHOW BURN
[1:51:33] <%SableS139a> @Qsmash_ @seaechiowai Thanks for the heads-up gents. SNK Universe canon is some fucking shit, and I absolutely love it.
[1:51:43] <andre11dr> @jiggy_snipe On the football field
[1:51:59] <@Menitta> I want KOFXV to have more Metal Slug
[1:51:59] <+jiggy_snipe> yea and then he lied about it
[1:52:01] <CyberEne> THAT WAS FUN
[1:52:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @andre11dr with his one white leg
[1:52:05] <CyberEne> also i am a women
[1:52:10] <seaechiowai> @sables139a read kof new beginning, it's great
[1:52:22] <Kiyosuki> I kinda liked that Athena was so stupid overpowered in this, cause like...of course she is she's a god. lol
[1:52:24] <+TopTieramisu> kof new beginning's art is great
[1:52:36] <+TopTieramisu> though i don't think it's updated in a while
[1:52:36] <andre11dr> And then Pat torched kids
[1:52:41] <daddydagath> Aren't they all just violent?
[1:52:50] <deafmelone> yes woolie the pie stealing liar, who picks boss characters
[1:52:52] <CyberEne> i think i did well as terry
[1:52:59] <+jiggy_snipe> yea but he's like extra violent
[1:53:09] <+TopTieramisu> violent ken's got a softer voice than regular ken
[1:53:18] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Purple is a Violent colour
[1:53:19] <+Kyanta_Rojo> You did good @CyberEne.
[1:53:21] <RodCU> yuss, Violent Ken action
[1:53:32] <+Someitalian123> I know ppl like to joke about violent ken, but honestly, I feel like it is at least a more interesting name than evil ken

[1:53:32] <RodCU> Zero is also broken in this game right?
[1:53:40] <duskfeather6578> Ken's speed into goku instant transmisson
[1:53:42] <seaechiowai> v.ken can shut down newbies with teleport alone
[1:53:42] <%SableS139a> Speaking of SNK manga, wasn't there an official one where Mai is the family cat, Nako's a thuggish yankee chick, and Kyo's her younger brother?
[1:53:47] <andre11dr> Also Woolie rejected sex with 3 hot bisexual women for Marvel, this is a true story
[1:53:48] <%SableS139a> @RodCU Oh hell yeah.
[1:53:52] <+kewlmyc> I was going to say I wanted Violent Ken back, but I forgot he was in SFII Anniversary or whatever it was called that was releases a few years ago
[1:53:52] <RodCU> CoolCat
[1:53:56] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:53:58] <+casssmithart> You'd think they'd have went with 'Psycho Ken'
[1:54:03] <RodCU> @SableS139a it ain't Zero if he ain't broken
[1:54:06] <+cowkid222> which version of zero is in here?
[1:54:07] <daddydagath> He just sits down like the nerd he is
[1:54:10] <%SableS139a> @RodCU First fightan appearance for Zero too, if that helps anything.
[1:54:11] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:54:14] <%Jetzord> @andre11dr are we just going to up the number of women everytime?
[1:54:16] <+TopTieramisu> @cowkid222 the one from mega man zero
[1:54:16] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Punished Ken
[1:54:16] <duskfeather6578> Zero ZX
[1:54:27] <RodCU> That's true!
[1:54:28] <Kiyosuki> Its the MMZ version
[1:54:29] <%gatorafan> One of these days I'll read that KOF Manhwa.
[1:54:30] <deafmelone> Megaman Zero
[1:54:32] <RodCU> Zero's first fighting game
[1:54:42] <+cowkid222> cool cool, thanks chat
[1:54:46] <%SableS139a> Am I the only one who thinks that Zero's MMZ version looks cooler than his X design?
[1:54:50] <+jetjagger222> nope
[1:54:51] <Kiyosuki> I actually really love this version of Zero, although he's just as op as he normally is in other fighters lol
[1:54:55] <RodCU> I think it looks cooler as well
[1:54:56] <OkamiDude15> zero's first and last fighting game :(
[1:54:57] <+TopTieramisu> @SableS139a yeah. not a fan of green nips
[1:55:02] <Kiyosuki> I actually like the MMZ version more too but its a matter of taste
[1:55:04] <%gatorafan> @sables139a, I think they both have their good and bad points
[1:55:11] <duskfeather6578> @SableS139a not the only one
[1:55:14] <seaechiowai> boo
[1:55:15] <soul4rce> god damn those dashes
[1:55:18] <RodCU> I like the MMZ version but MMX Zero looks more adult like???
[1:55:19] <Kiyosuki> Omega Zero should have looked like classic X Zero though.
[1:55:25] <RodCU> in MMZ they all look like children
[1:55:26] <+TopTieramisu> that's just the style
[1:55:30] <seaechiowai> time running coward boo
[1:55:30] <RodCU> yeh
[1:55:33] <deafmelone> i just fade out the green headlights outta my vision
[1:55:35] <+cowkid222> I like the chunky zero from X, but yeah the green nips....
[1:55:36] <OkamiDude15> i would like to see MMZ get the marvel treatment. he's got alot to work with
[1:55:37] <+BlockingDisabled> MMZ Zero was also in Onimusha Blade Warriors, too/
[1:55:39] <%gatorafan> @kiyosuki, the biggest let down of that series.
[1:55:42] <@Menitta> ah man I need to keep playing the Zero collection
[1:55:45] <Man_in_the_Red> Zero's green nips are prominant and unavoidable
[1:55:59] <Kiyosuki> IKR that would have been such an amazing gut punch
[1:55:59] <Solidnick18> GivePLZ
[1:56:01] <%jdestroyer97> jdestroyer97 subscribed with Prime.
[1:56:01] <+TopTieramisu> MMZ franchise was a much better followup to X than a lot of the latter X games
[1:56:04] <%SableS139a> @Kiyosuki I've been saying this shit for fucking years. Why it wasn't done, I'll never know.
[1:56:07] <Man_in_the_Red> give me Inti Creates's design any day
[1:56:08] <+cowkid222> they demand your attention
[1:56:09] <Kiyosuki> Amazing little series still though <3 the Zero series
[1:56:14] <@Menitta> but Command Mission
[1:56:16] <%Parlux> woooooooooooooooo
[1:56:18] <+TopTieramisu> MMZ 3 and 4 are fantastic
[1:56:23] <bentobeatdown> he's gonna pump ya up
[1:56:30] <deafmelone> Zero's green nips should be bigger and should glow with car horn noises
[1:56:33] <+jetjagger222> is it power instinct time
[1:56:34] <andre11dr> You know what chat, i actually never played an Onimusha game
[1:56:35] <+TopTieramisu> and have you seen the bosses in MMZ3? so nice
[1:56:35] <CyberEne> wanna go again
[1:56:36] <daddydagath> Pumped UWU
[1:56:39] <Kiyosuki> Good four games, and had the guts to actually end.
[1:56:45] <%Parlux> GG woolie its been 10 years since I left the FGC this inspired me
[1:57:02] <RodCU> @Kiyosuki I was impressed that they made a 4th one since the 3rd game felt like closure
[1:57:13] <Kiyosuki> I like to see 4th game as the epilogue
[1:57:14] <ChortlesJ1> N U D E place
[1:57:15] <+TopTieramisu> @Kiyosuki the 4th one really felt like closure
[1:57:17] <SaltyAzteca> Nude place Kreygasm
[1:57:22] <%gatorafan> ngl I cried like a bitch on Zero 4's end daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:57:27] <OkamiDude15> menitta we gotta push steel massimo for mahvel 4 woolieMIRIN
[1:57:27] <CyberEne> i cant believe i did well
[1:57:30] <+TopTieramisu> after all, the big bad was still alive after 3
[1:57:30] <daddydagath> Getting pumped up in the Nude place
[1:57:32] <GeltonZ> Matrimelee makes me sad because for most people it's the ONLY Power Instinct they've ever played and they think it's "The good one" when in reality its one of the weaker games in the series.
[1:57:42] <huskarl_zap> fun posters? that what they're called now.
[1:57:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> @parlux Dude you did well! sometimes fightan games are just great
[1:57:46] <+jetjagger222> is it? huh TIL
[1:57:47] <+Mottyrob> Fred Wood? Damn I'll say I'm still enjoying Liam's pins, they look real good on my hat
[1:57:50] <+cowkid222> going hard at the NUDE PLACE
[1:57:52] <+jetjagger222> the SNES one was pretty fun
[1:57:59] <deafmelone> Groove on Fight is neat too
[1:58:00] <duskfeather6578> @OkamiDude15 Argeed
[1:58:05] <+jetjagger222> matrimelee also has lets go onmyouji
[1:58:09] <RodCU> Kyo Kreygasm
[1:58:11] <+TopTieramisu> mmz4's ending was great
[1:58:23] <andre11dr> I don't remember if Kyo has fire wave in this
[1:58:29] <+TopTieramisu> fire wave?
[1:58:32] <andre11dr> I don't think he does
[1:58:34] <+TopTieramisu> the projectile?
[1:58:37] <%VillainForACause> He does not
[1:58:42] <GeltonZ> Japanese version of Power Instinct Legends is great and yeah so is Groove On Fight. Alas Fightcade only has the crappy US version of Legends.
[1:58:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> @andre11dr it's the rekka version thsts in this
[1:58:46] <CyberEne> @WoolieVersus wanna do another go if were continueing svc
[1:58:54] <%SableS139a> Matrimelee's entire OST is golden, but when Let's Go Onmyouji exists, it's hard to remember the other tracks.
[1:59:11] <+jetjagger222> overclocked hearts is fun too
[1:59:14] <OkamiDude15> a marvel mix of steel massimo's theme would be fucking SICK

[2:05:25] <+ThatsMyTrunks> Folks here talkin' shit about 3 tabs open like they don't have 10 of their own.
[2:05:27] <leomuratore> Deep lore

[2:05:31] <+jetjagger222> my complaint is that the stages are dull as dishwater
[2:05:37] <Kiyosuki> thats definitely another one
[2:05:40] <+jetjagger222> like vanilla 2k2
[2:05:42] <RodCU> They are not from here they're from outer space. Space people.
[2:05:48] <Kiyosuki> This games got a lot going for it but its got some jank
[2:05:51] <Kiyosuki> that held it back

[2:06:06] <%BinaryFireball> are we from outerspace?

[2:10:34] <andre11dr> I mean, look man, Terry is virgin at 25 ,we have to empties a little
[2:10:40] <Kiyosuki> honestly too I think pink is a really underrated horror color
[2:10:41] <CyberEne> that was fun
[2:10:50] <@Menitta> rip Terry
[2:10:51] <Kiyosuki> there's something really uneasy about pink used in horrific situations to me
[2:10:55] <%Irridium> didn't even make a twitlonger
[2:11:00] <HelluvaNohbody> No it's Berry Toegaurd
[2:11:01] <+jiggy_snipe> what is this a reference to?

[2:11:03] <fernandapsdois> lordji1Refill
[2:11:05] <OkamiDude15> terry hasnt tweeted since :(
[2:11:06] <RodCU> Hot take, they should ditch Terry's old design and just embrace the Garou one forever and ever
[2:11:06] <Kiyosuki> it might be that
[2:11:11] <@Menitta> Terry: "A Statement:"
[2:11:12] <CyberEne> yeah im gonna play some gg with a friend
[2:11:12] <$emptyantics> Is it a Hot Take if I like GAROU Terry design better?
[2:11:16] <%mr_miyagucci> it was Jerry noguard
[2:11:26] <%temuginKhang> has he played dankuga yet
[2:11:27] <Kiyosuki> thats hardly a hot take
[2:11:28] <CyberEne> this was super fun
[2:11:31] <Kiyosuki> his garou look is super popular
[2:11:38] <+ThatsMyTrunks> woolieSMUG
[2:11:38] <HelluvaNohbody> @emptyantics Not a hot take if your right
[2:11:40] <andre11dr> Also Ryu is also a virgin in his 30s
[2:11:43] <+jetjagger222> @temuginKhang don't think so
[2:11:44] <+ThatsMyTrunks> theban10Twitchy
[2:11:52] <Kiyosuki> and yes it is his best look still imo
[2:12:00] <%temuginKhang> i think he'd be surprised at how solid dankuga is lol
[2:12:03] <Kiyosuki> though pizza delivery boy is iconic and I respect it

[2:13:17] <kulmoth> Chun IS sex
[2:13:21] <+roysharkxr3> Pretty much power instinct/matrimelee is long gone in legal hell
[2:13:25] <andre11dr> Also Akuma probably didn't fuck anything
[2:13:31] <%gatorafan> Master Roshi would slap Kula, Mai and Mary's asses.
[2:13:35] <Kiyosuki> Oh
[2:13:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wait, did Woolie play Breakers Revenge already?
[2:13:37] <RodCU> Yeah! I saw that video
[2:13:39] <Kiyosuki> I don't want to have hope
[2:13:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> Akuma doesn't even know what women are
[2:13:42] <GeltonZ> @GalacticaPhanto Yes
[2:13:44] <+jetjagger222> @GalacticaPhanto yes
[2:13:44] <%temuginKhang> i believe it's because there's no gambling relation
[2:13:45] <Man_in_the_Red> its a product of some sort
[2:13:50] <OkamiDude15> ios gacha game actually Kappa
[2:13:51] <Man_in_the_Red> i dont think its a game
[2:13:55] <Solidnick18> alright
[2:13:57] <GeltonZ> No they're just sitting on the copyright. They're not actually MAKING anything.
[2:14:01] <Man_in_the_Red> ... not a new one at least
[2:14:03] <+jetjagger222> they were marking out at how cool sho was
[2:14:03] <+casssmithart> I mean, 70% chance they're just preserving their trademark
[2:14:03] <+jiggy_snipe> it'll be a mobile game
[2:14:03] <%GalacticaPhanto> Oh I gotta go watch that after this

[2:14:12] <%Jetzord> bloody roar netflix anime incoming
[2:14:12] <%temuginKhang> bloody roar soda line
[2:14:22] <+jiggy_snipe> Konami switched to mainly Pachinko and mobile
[2:14:28] <$RunningNGunning> Bloody Roar line of Tampons
[2:14:30] <RodCU> Since it's Konami, if the game launches, it would have crappy netcode for sure
[2:14:34] <+jetjagger222> bloody roar action figures
[2:14:37] <deafmelone> Bloody Roar cup noodles collab
[2:14:46] <seaechiowai> just spam qcb p for cool kasumi combos
[2:14:47] <+ThatsMyTrunks> Bloody Roar Girls, though
[2:14:51] <$emptyantics> Any chance we’ll see you play Diepod’s Fighting Game?
[2:14:57] <+ThatsMyTrunks> How fucking good would that be
[2:14:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> They should just give the Darkstalkers IP to Keits and call it a day
[2:15:01] <RodCU> Bloody Roar Gacha Fighting Game, you have to buy to unlock moves Kappa
[2:15:08] <OkamiDude15> lets go reggie
[2:15:09] <%gatorafan> Bloody Roar playable on the next Yakuza game Kappa
[2:15:16] <RodCU> but those moves are consumables
[2:15:19] <%Parlux> @WoolieVersus reggie is a real one respect to both
[2:15:25] <Kiyosuki> oh god anyone doing anything with darkstalkers makes my heart hurt too much now
[2:15:33] <deafmelone> I just want more Shina man, and Shenlong

[2:16:44] <%Parlux> Yo my super wasn't hitting cause sagat is to tall lol
[2:16:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> ikari warriors is a bad game
[2:16:51] <andre11dr> Ikari warriors was also kinda bad
[2:16:59] <Kiyosuki> Kula is certainly 80% of Salty Bet Kappa
[2:17:06] <GrayFoxN312> Psycho Soldier is one of the first if not the first game with a recorded song inserted into a game, for the game @woolieversus
[2:17:08] <%Parlux> Yo USA team tho
[2:17:12] <HelluvaNohbody> I Want the sports team back
[2:17:13] <+jiggy_snipe> yea KOF was an SNK crossover game
[2:17:15] <%gatorafan> The original Fatal Fury tournament was called The King of Fighters
[2:17:15] <%Parlux> dat USA team theme
[2:17:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> wooow so Sakurai stole the concept of Smash from SNK? cringe.... Kappa
[2:17:24] <%Jetzord> @RodCU Sticker star
[2:17:30] <%temuginKhang> no more sports team
[2:17:36] <%temuginKhang> get their sons and put them in an esports team
[2:17:40] <andre11dr> It's in Smash actually
[2:17:42] <+roysharkxr3> does this mean it's matrimelee time
[2:17:43] <GeltonZ> @FuqBoiSlim Actually yes. Smash was inspired by him kicking a girl's ass too hard in KOF and feeling bad about it.
[2:17:47] <RodCU> Lucky Glabuer and Heavy D are sick though @temuginKhang
[2:17:47] <@Menitta> I had way more fun with that than I was led to believe
[2:17:48] <seaechiowai> no, dbz and touhou are the 80% of salty bet
[2:17:49] <andre11dr> Both versions

[3:53:52] <SomersaultJustice> no no, that's not what I meant
[3:54:03] <SomersaultJustice> I was joking that it said for use in Japan only
[3:54:33] <+jetjagger222> ABOBO
[3:54:35] <%temuginKhang> maybe it only shows in arcade?
[3:54:35] <@Menitta> Sissy is fire in Saltybet
[3:54:37] <%mrlastchance1> what is this?!?!
[3:54:41] <+patrickng714> wats her stage?
[3:54:48] <+shan89> the final boss of the game
[3:55:07] <bryxobryx> Did something happen to Woolie’s past broadcasts, or is it just my phone refusing to show me anything earlier than a couple days?
[3:55:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:55:13] <GeltonZ> @patrickng714 It's basically this but with a sick remix of the wedding march
[3:55:15] <+patrickng714> i unironically wish Atlus releases a Power Instinct collection
[3:55:28] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie deleted all vods due to DMCA concerns
[3:55:36] <%Jetzord> @bryxobryx nuked for safety due to DMCA bots going around
[3:55:36] <edgeyberzerker> @patrickng714 they really should, the series is pretty awesome. Great memories of the first one
[3:55:38] <GeltonZ> @patrickng714 SAME. Because we STILL don't have a home port of the last one!
[3:55:51] <+patrickng714> then Atlus takes 5 years to release it worldwide Kappa
[3:55:52] <%SvenHolgersson> Can you dodge supers?
[3:55:53] <SomersaultJustice> man, that means that match I had with woolie on his birthday is lost in the ether
[3:55:56] <soul4rce> woolie royshark says reiji p2 for her song
[3:56:00] <edgeyberzerker> oh wait Atlus hates money
[3:56:00] <bryxobryx> How awful
[3:56:01] <%SvenHolgersson> That would be nuts
[3:56:34] <deafmelone> try reiji p2 for her song?
[3:56:38] <soul4rce> so choose sissy as reiji I think?
[3:56:40] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Reiji P2 for Sissy's song apparently?
[3:56:41] <bryxobryx> No backups I assume. So whatever is saved on youtube is as far as some series will get.
[3:56:55] <+patrickng714> @geltonz true but a lot of weird fighting games seen be getting Switch releases like Rage of the Dragon
[3:56:59] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Reiji P2 for her song apparently?
[3:57:12] <%temuginKhang> frogged
[3:57:15] <GeltonZ> @patrickng714 Sadly we don't know if RotD is actually coming to Switch
[3:57:17] <Arek_1> LUL
[3:57:23] <+shan89> the IP is in a weird limbo, yeah it's atlus but something with the guy behind the IP where he just hold onto it
[3:57:27] <+TopTieramisu> goenettez
[3:57:32] <soul4rce> im still waiting in breakers collection
[3:57:39] <+patrickng714> @geltonz well a port to somewhere is being worked on
[3:57:45] <GeltonZ> @patrickng714 Yup
[3:58:02] <+patrickng714> @soul4rce isnt that actually happening?
[3:58:05] <bryxobryx> A port to the past
[3:58:08] <soul4rce> yeah
