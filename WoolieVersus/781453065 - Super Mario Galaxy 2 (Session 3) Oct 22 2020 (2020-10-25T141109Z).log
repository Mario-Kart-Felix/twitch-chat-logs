[0:00:54] <@Menitta> I'm now back the fuck in with Tetris 99

[0:02:26] <bdota3> Wait is that supposed to be the hokage hat in the back?
[0:02:33] <dylhelm93> whoa reggie's beard levelled up in the last week!
[0:03:17] <%Prevot> If you just progressed through the game normally you'd only ever see the same stages anyway
[0:03:19] <%JustYudha> Dokage hat
[0:03:27] <%Prevot> there's a single optimal route to speedrun the game
[0:03:31] <%EdenOfLove> Volume kinda quiet
[0:03:37] <RodCU> VoHiYo
[0:03:50] <gregisonline> hey that's Woolie Versus
[0:04:23] <@Solidus_113> SPACEW
[0:04:37] <%emperordread> Call of Back Down
[0:04:43] <%fritz_dacat> war is not for woolie
[0:05:05] <DelgotHansto> Hey that campaign is good, shame about the multiplayer
[0:05:07] <dylhelm93> i'd kill to see infinity ward do a gundam game like that!
[0:05:21] <YakumoYomi> That's high praise, considering how divisive Infinite Warfare is among the community
[0:05:24] <+jiggy_snipe> space dogfighting
[0:05:35] <%KyoryUtchy> 3rd best? You just gonna sandbag Apex Legends like that huh?
[0:05:37] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I just picked up IW and my FIRST thought was that it’s Titanfall 3
[0:05:39] <dmysta3000> CoD = Broke, Space CoD = Bespoke
[0:05:40] <glass_marcus> This sounds rad
[0:05:43] <DelgotHansto> Cant fuck up history when it's the future its legitimately what they should have leaned into harder
[0:05:48] <Darren716> Woolie thats not the only reason why they hated it, it was because it was the 5th future game in a row. Plus mp wasnt geeat
[0:05:58] <+RC_S3kshun8> ^
[0:06:30] <@Solidus_113> 14th
[0:06:45] <+RC_S3kshun8> It may have even done better if it wasn't attached to the CoD franchise - but they wanted/needed the AAA Name brand exposure
[0:06:51] <DelgotHansto> You should try out the VR game with it its fucking rad
[0:07:02] <+jiggy_snipe> It's unfortunate cuz IW is different enough from the other future games cuz it's far future.
[0:07:16] <+RC_S3kshun8> Yeah. I would love IW funding on TitanFall.
[0:07:21] <DelgotHansto> Man I'm thinking IS IW THE BEST COD CAMPAIGN?
[0:07:41] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I’m glad it’s getting shown love now. It’s kind of like how people Halo 2 at first because of the campaign
[0:07:51] <DelgotHansto> Most of the others have not aged that well imo
[0:07:52] <+RC_S3kshun8> IW was released to deliberately spank Titanfall. And that is depressing.
[0:08:02] <@Solidus_113> captions are done and live
[0:08:03] <Reveresao> Remember Deikun!!
[0:08:13] <Darren716> I think i may do a text post on sub about the context behind the IW trailer reaction
[0:08:13] <%guyalex> it was great, looking forward to the next one!
[0:08:14] <dizimous> I've only watched a bit but it was a rad vid dude

[0:17:23] <RamenRiderZ> Year of Luigi every year
[0:17:24] <glass_marcus> Luigi can jump higher and is a bit faster
[0:17:24] <yeetdabsenpai69> oh no slipping AND ice physics
[0:17:25] <+RC_S3kshun8> @WoolieVersus Can you now shake down mario for those bits, then switch and shake yourself back down tot dupe aforementioned bits?
[0:17:25] <BlackermanZX> Now we can write a book about how awesome Luigi is
[0:17:25] <missingangle> LUGI, hell yeah
[0:17:30] <Darren716> His triple jump is different
[0:17:30] <@Menitta> The way to unlock Luigi in Galaxy 1 was stupid as fuck. 100% the game first
[0:17:37] <scrublordsamurai> i wish he had the hover jump from 2
[0:17:39] <+Beniial> Luigi is optimal for speedruns

[0:21:06] <Darren716> Playing as Luigi also does something else every time you beat a level as him
[0:21:10] <%KyoryUtchy> Mario not a landlord because the residents aren't living on 'land', they're living on his head. Luigi and the other tenants are technically classified as a type of head lice, and thus have no rights under the law.
[0:21:22] <@Menitta> There's a glitch in Mario Sunshine where if you lose his hat, and talk to someone, you'll still lose health but you'll stay alive unitl you leave the conversation
[0:21:45] <glass_marcus> the time limit is fine, the music change isn't

[0:57:06] <+Superbro64> Game Maker's Toolkit had a video on lives. Long story short: whatever you choose, it's how it's designed with the game that counts.
[0:57:31] <Prevot> *sonic voice* you're too slOooOWw
[0:57:39] <%doomerskeletor13> gotta go fast
[0:57:42] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Lives are supposed to be punishing but fair
[0:57:44] <phantomsleeves> is there only one path?
[0:57:44] <@Menitta> Galaxy 1 was stupid with lives. When you exit the game, they reset to 4
[0:57:50] <zeif00> I feel like he's losing a lot of momentum when he runs into a wall
[0:57:57] <hassanico2> Doesn't this game reset you to 5 too?
[0:58:04] <@Menitta> i think so
[0:58:19] <%Prevot> ddin't all 3D marios reset your lives when you turn the game off?
[0:58:29] <@Menitta> I know 3D World didnt

[0:59:06] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> We come for the botches tho
[0:59:07] <PhantomMaskJr> Woolie do you know about the secret Double Kick move? If you must run towards an enemy and spin when he gets close to an enemy.Then near the end of his spin,Mario must preform a Long Jump by crouching and quickly jumping.Mario must have the sprinkles around him are it will just turn in a regular long jump larxaLurk

[1:04:19] <@Menitta> Its shocking how well these levels and the manta ray racing work on the Switch version
[1:04:26] <Darren716> The surfing can fuck off though
[1:04:26] <%EdenOfLove> nowhere near as unforgiving as monkey ball tho
[1:04:42] <+C0baltCrusade> these missions along with the surfing missions are the only things that make emulating this game absolute pain

[1:10:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Does Luigi play different? Just showed up.
[1:10:32] <@Menitta> I like this remix of the Mario World ghost theme
[1:10:40] <%bread_assassin> Y'know, they should switch controls whenever they're playing as Luigi.
[1:10:45] <Darren716> Luigi jumps higher but is slippery
[1:10:50] <@Menitta> He does play differently. He's got more of a slide and he moves slightly faster

[1:12:34] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Luigi has his slippery run, like in Super Mario Bros. 2.
[1:12:45] <Stormiercashew> luigis girth is unstoppable and therefore he slides

[1:12:48] <exnuart> luigi is slippery and runs out of air faster underwater

[1:13:27] <+Blunder_Blue> His cosmic clone races are also harder in Galaxy 1 because Cosmic Luigi uses shortcuts.
[1:13:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Fun fact, Boo's Japanese name Teresa, was a reference to a programmers wife. Really shy when you looked at her, but scary when angry. Probably because the programmer came home late too much.

[1:53:35] <hassanico2> LUL
[1:53:36] <metabot64> they could just be using a new model
[1:53:51] <metabot64> cuz they can't just scale up the textures right?
[1:54:13] <exnuart> usually textures are scaled dowb
[1:54:13] <hassanico2> LUL
[1:54:42] <Darren716> that was a secret star
[1:54:53] <exnuart> and a lot of these are very flat shades so texture quality doesn't really need to be a thing
[1:54:59] <Timurine> This whole game is a trip
[1:55:05] <metabot64> well i guess if the normal goombas use a scaled down textures then the giant goombas use regular maybe it would work

[1:55:56] <hassanico2> Why are we in a background texture universe right now?
[1:56:15] <+Blunder_Blue> I believe the purpose of the ghosts isn't just for time trials but also because the Luigi ghosts show off secrets
[1:56:32] <%KyoryUtchy> It's fine. Even if you got the secret star you'd still have to redo the level to collect the ~regular~ star, so it's the same amount of work either way.

[3:17:05] <+TheOneCalledRock> was there ever a thing where it tells you about the pads?
[3:17:06] <Darren716> god damn it
[3:17:18] <Darren716> Yes, the instruction manual lol
[3:17:30] <Darren716> For some reason they have a whole section in the manual
[3:17:36] <%chll0ne> @darren716 LUL LUL
[3:17:37] <Darren716> Despite them only being in this level
[3:17:43] <+TheOneCalledRock> of course LUL

[3:18:50] <Darren716> Yeah the lilypad gets as much space in the manual as pull stars and that bird you use to fly
[3:18:50] <%Prevot> now you can collect SKY RENT
[3:18:51] <+IceyCone> it's fluff, pun intended
[3:18:54] <%chll0ne> @memedaddy6969 you know how Nintendo do

[3:20:18] <+TheOneCalledRock> @memedaddy6969 that's part of the nintendo band too, LUL you tend to forget they are like that untill it happens and then you are like "oh right..."
[3:20:26] <+Taisuru> Woolie just doesn't want to admit he rides around in a car shaped like his own head
[3:21:18] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL

[3:23:16] <+TheOneCalledRock> toad NO
[3:23:41] <Darren716> You really dont need to off screen anything
[3:24:02] <Blaxel411> Sol truly was the Guilty Gear
[3:24:11] <Darren716> Like all the stars are worth seeing normally, but for a regular run it wont take too long
[3:24:25] <+TheOneCalledRock> honestly i'd say off screen purely for the sake that the came is fun in of itself
[3:24:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> game*
[3:24:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Not even the real endgame challenge
[3:24:57] <Darren716> I'll put it in perspective, you need a little more than half the stars to beat the game, and theres 120 base stars
[3:25:16] <Darren716> So the extra content would take a lot more time
[3:25:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[3:32:35] <%ozzrabbit> Goblet
[3:32:38] <%Dean_Inbetween> in the united states religion is still somewhat relevant because there was no attempt at ever creating a state mandate for it
[3:32:55] <%Dean_Inbetween> Because the founding fathers were super agnostic

[3:35:00] <Darren716> Why isnt that a line in guilty gear?
[3:35:01] <%Dean_Inbetween> I believe the reason its super hated in quebec is because of the french forcing arcadia to be this religious utopian society and it backfired as time went on
