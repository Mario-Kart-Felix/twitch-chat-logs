[0:16:34] <raikagelord1> You got a Combo him.
[0:16:34] <%Javaa01> Doggo is a punishment for shooting his shield
[0:16:34] <jeosadn> @WoolieVersus Shooting the shield summons a dog, so wait for the window
[0:16:35] <dinnydanny777> That tutorial lies l

[0:16:41] <+segmentedfool> ABSOLUTELY BODIED

[0:16:44] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus stop shooting the shield, only counterhit. Shotgun and ballista work best
[0:16:44] <%lewdskeletor13> All that matters is the counter, trying to hit him when the shield is up is folly
[0:16:45] <brambobelurkin> @WoolieVersus Wolf only spawns if you shoo the shield Woolie

[0:17:28] <laguerrilha> @gunsrlove nothing on the game tells you about the dog/shield stuff
[0:17:31] <%DesertPenguin> ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER
[0:17:32] <raikagelord1> @superkirby24 exactly
[0:17:32] <Kidbizzaro> Its the most memorable part of that movie.
[0:17:34] <venomfury86> this is the way
[0:17:34] <ghostspartan80> shooting the shield summons the dog btw
[0:17:39] <%mitchteck> When flash green super shotgun into ballista
[0:17:41] <london_flexing> Which movie?
[0:17:46] <gunsrlove> @laguerrilha that's fin,e let him struggle against destiny
[0:17:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Only part of the movie I remember
[0:17:55] <%SliceOfGouda> Splody
[0:17:55] <heart_ablaze> Ballista also works
[0:17:56] <megamonmon123> oof
[0:17:56] <BusterRepukken> how is Woolie doing better than other youtubers and game journalists.
[0:17:58] <%nepwar> the chokes
[0:17:58] <%SuperKirby24> sniped LUL
[0:17:58] <@Solidus_113> use the balliata
[0:17:59] <jeosadn> 2 try was soo much better
[0:17:59] <Snakes_dk> dayum
[0:18:01] <DeathByPoke7> getting there
[0:18:01] <derap41> Getting closer
[0:18:04] <Lord_maxios> ballista

[0:18:06] <+blastazoid26> gotta dash more
[0:18:06] <centuronstar> tron legacy ost is godly
[0:18:07] <akman14> Use ballista
[0:18:07] <+aishman> Balista TOTALLY works with him
[0:18:08] <%paladinstarbuster> BALLISTA IS GOOD FOR HIM TO
[0:18:09] <BusterRepukken> SkillUp had a massive fit over the Marauder, lmao
[0:18:11] <%SuperKirby24> does woolie have the critical health rune unlocked?
[0:18:11] <dinnydanny777> I never saw it, is my knowledge of it through KH Dream Drop Distance enough?
[0:18:12] <raikagelord1> Combo Shotty into Arrow.
[0:18:13] <%Josef_Stryker> Try Super Shotty + Ballista
[0:18:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Once you get the timing down you can deal with Marauders pretty efficiently
[0:18:17] <brambobelurkin> @WoolieVersus pro tip Shotgun into Ballista
[0:18:18] <jase__x> didn't thus guy like get nerves or something
[0:18:19] <megamonmon123> ballista and super shotgun are good tes
[0:18:21] <%RVMSpeedWagon> Lmaooo switching between super shot and ballista is the tech
[0:18:23] <cochramd1992> @BusterRepukken what a fucking scrub
[0:18:24] <bethore> This fight is so damn good in Nightmare difficulty
[0:18:27] <+CryptusMaximus> I'm glad Woolie lost his lives. Now he's gotta LEARN LUL
[0:18:27] <vampireinarm> podcast still on for today?
[0:18:28] <Miklosher> Chat got super backseaty..
[0:18:28] <venomfury86> Reggie, tell him to glory kill the Marauder while aiming at his legs
[0:18:32] <%Shishi1205> There
[0:18:33] <dinnydanny777> Big damage
[0:18:36] <brambobelurkin> There we go
[0:18:38] <MKII> maybe it's time for woolie to learn about COMBOS
[0:18:39] <%TheREALGirthMan> You can get 3 hits in each opening just by switching ballista shotty ballista
[0:18:40] <AnarkyF1oyd> play like DMC combo SS+Balista
[0:18:41] <ShakeTheW> When is the soundtrack hitting streaming services man BibleThump
[0:18:41] <%lewdskeletor13> @vampireinarm Tomorrow
[0:18:42] <jeosadn> Lets start a betting pool, I say Woolie gets it on the 5th try
[0:18:44] <+ALazo> guys don't give him the good tech until he's done it once
[0:18:46] <+seduwu> @vampireinarm podcast is tomorrow
[0:18:46] <SuperTurboSABER> @BusterRepukken because woolie isnt a dumb journalist trying to justify why the game is unfair
[0:18:52] <huskarl_zap> And now onto the next problem with this
[0:18:54] <%SuperKirby24> OwO
[0:18:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YO
[0:18:56] <Treuan> It's a rough fight for everyone
[0:19:01] <raikagelord1> This enemy has a Dedicated Loop/Combo.
[0:19:01] <ToxInjection> He's beginning to believe.
[0:19:02] <%invader_rin> Let Woolie figure it out on his own
[0:19:03] <jeosadn> get down mister president!
[0:19:06] <%Josef_Stryker> HIS DOG JUST PROTECTED HIM
[0:19:09] <%RVMSpeedWagon> I fucking love fighting Mauraders

[0:19:22] <%lewdskeletor13> I really love the Marauders too
[0:19:26] <+nintega010> does wiilie not know how to quick switch? even on controller it's possible
[0:19:31] <cochramd1992> Woolie my man, you have to rapid switch weapons
[0:19:34] <+nintega010> woolie*
[0:19:35] <%SuperKirby24> willie Kappa
[0:19:45] <megamonmon123> @lewdskeletor13 yeah this only boss fight with him is cool
[0:19:48] <dinnydanny777> The speed he pulls the shield out at seems pretty cheap
[0:19:48] <akman14> He is so close to the combo
[0:19:51] <%Shishi1205> Pog
[0:19:51] <laguerrilha> a lot of people hate the Marauders, but i like the challange of it

[0:22:58] <cochramd1992> Super Shotgun is the #1 weapon to use on the Marauders
[0:22:59] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> the prowler was multiplayer exclusive in 2016
[0:22:59] <%TheREALGirthMan> @ReckonZX Super weapons only refer to the BIG guns, not regular weapons
[0:23:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @reckonzx Nope, the ssg is one of the best guns to use on it. It’s resistant to the BGF superweapon
[0:23:10] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Nighstalker Don't Quit.

[0:29:50] <bethore> I love how Woolie

[0:30:00] <megamonmon123> also your slayer gate key
[0:30:00] <%lewdskeletor13> ARE YA WINNING SOM
[0:30:03] <VJdarkworld> unlock DOUBLE XP with DORITOS
[0:30:08] <ralphfromdk> Do we have both crystals from the bottom level yet?
[0:30:14] <bethore> Woolie hates Betheseda and he's only exposure is DOOM
[0:30:20] <heart_ablaze> NomNom
[0:30:25] <%Javaa01> There's more batteries then you need
[0:30:28] <derap41> POg aquired
[0:30:29] <megamonmon123> You get more than you need
[0:30:29] <+slimmixrp> You can get more batteries than you need @WoolieVersus
[0:30:29] <+Ether101_Prime> The costumes should have come with more stuff in the room with them to make it .
[0:30:36] <Funky_Honkey> has he fought Vergil yet?
[0:30:37] <mdkcde> having to log in for offline skins is fucking horseshit
[0:30:39] <Nested_Dreams> I think woolie has only cookies left to unlock
[0:30:40] <heart_ablaze> yes
[0:30:41] <%TheREALGirthMan> To be fair Bethesda is not great even at their best
[0:30:42] <%lewdskeletor13> You’ll have an overflow
[0:30:44] <%BisoromiBear> Mistakes were made, don't rub it in.
[0:30:44] <laguerrilha> At this point not lgoging in is only hurting you more than they. Bethesda got their $ already
[0:30:45] <+Vadriel25> Now that he's completed the mission he bought the costume in, he should be able to use it. I think it wouldn't last stream because it hadn't properly unlocked yet by finishing the mission
[0:30:45] <brambobelurkin> the tragic tale of Samual Hayden
[0:30:47] <cochramd1992> RESOOOOOOOLVE

[0:31:03] <megamonmon123> he stonewalls you, he regrets nothing
[0:31:07] <+Ether101_Prime> Woolie still doesn't understand what happened.
[0:31:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:11] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, go touch that Unmakyr pedastal
[0:31:12] <%Shishi1205> Its argent not hell
[0:31:17] <%lewdskeletor13> I still like Sam, despite being a shithead
[0:31:19] <%TheREALGirthMan> But Woolie, Sam is not the villain of this story, remember? Kappa
[0:31:20] <brambobelurkin> How clsoe are we to the Unmakyr?
[0:31:22] <derap41> Hey We still need Fossile fuels
[0:31:23] <MonstarGrrrl> hell energy now 50% off!
[0:31:24] <laguerrilha> Wasnt the hell energy that caused the Earth invasion
[0:31:32] <heart_ablaze> maybe was playing devil games. this is were it got him
[0:31:33] <mdkcde> @laguerrilha Fuck 'em making an account will only give them more money by doing nothing of worth
[0:31:35] <%lewdskeletor13> But the energy helped make the mechs that prolonged earths survival
[0:31:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> I mean, didn't he figure out how to do it synthetically? Vegan Hell juice.
[0:31:41] <heart_ablaze> * hayden
[0:31:43] <+Undenizen> It's not like you can kill him in a meaningful way
[0:31:46] <+Mecha_G> I see a cage for rabbit
[0:31:48] <megamonmon123> unmaykr?
[0:31:58] <shin_marx> he held that crucible in a pretty cool stance, tho
[0:31:59] <Tha_Mik> Secrets?
[0:32:02] <+nintega010> Markipliers dad book
[0:32:02] <laguerrilha> The model viewer?
[0:32:03] <@Solidus_113> Dopefish on Chainsaw?
[0:32:04] <venomfury86> Quake 2 music
[0:32:05] <cochramd1992> Hell Juice is just souls though
[0:32:08] <%dekkitout> His sweet nunchucks?
[0:32:10] <satans_finest_millennial> Bethesda is Dead to me until they roll the stone off their tomb and say Elder scrolls 6 is single player only and free to mod
[0:32:11] <snakest3alth> Soulcube?
[0:32:14] <%ChoculaUltra> I want a bisected Sam Hayden figma/paperweight tho
[0:32:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Huh I thought you saw everything
[0:32:18] <venomfury86> Quad Machine
[0:32:29] <derap41> @cochramd1992 Using your Grandmas soul to power you grassclipper
[0:32:37] <+Creggamonsta> good 2 see your feeling better reg
[0:32:44] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You can check all active weapon mastery challenges under the challenges tab, so you don't need to dig around for them
[0:32:46] <Yummy_Nukes> don't forget mobile turret mastery
[0:32:48] <raikagelord1> Model Viewe would be cool.
[0:32:51] <laguerrilha> The only thing he didnt saw was the model viewer for enemies
[0:32:52] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh when Sam said Slipgate that’s a reference to Quake
[0:32:52] <@Solidus_113> dash is free
[0:32:53] <+valiard> No podcast today?
[0:32:56] <BusterRepukken> or get rid of the slo mo perk because it sucks
[0:32:56] <VJdarkworld> make hell energy out of plant souls .... though that may create a DMC5 scenario
[0:32:59] <%DesertPenguin> ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[0:33:03] <Funky_Honkey> the only pro tip for DOOM is "never stop moving"
[0:33:04] <%lewdskeletor13> @valiard Tomorrow
[0:33:05] <Ozmodyas> Yeah, Dash refills almost instantly now that you have the cooldown upgrade
[0:33:06] <+Undenizen> Woolie, you're describing Kirby

[0:33:42] <megamonmon123> sorta
[0:33:48] <grimshuck> If you find switching grenades hard, rebind it to l3
[0:33:53] <+Cal2994> Wollie goblins
[0:33:59] <+nintega010> everyone forgets. max kept forgeting to use fire
[0:34:01] <VJdarkworld> @dinnydanny777 forbidden fruit O_o

[0:34:08] <megamonmon123> @grimshuck oh you can do that?
[0:34:21] <venomfury86> when i played the next level it reminded me of Quake 2
[0:34:26] <brambobelurkin> ^
[0:34:28] <heart_ablaze> rippy boi
[0:34:32] <mark_collins45> How did Woolie do against The Marauder?
[0:34:35] <%lewdskeletor13> The next level does indeed slap
[0:34:39] <megamonmon123> he died twice
[0:34:42] <%Javaa01> It's very good
[0:34:44] <%Shishi1205> 2 deaths @mark_collins45
[0:34:45] <megamonmon123> but he got it
[0:34:47] <grimshuck> @megamonmon123 Yeah you re-bind all buttons.

[0:34:48] <%lewdskeletor13> @mark_collins45 Got him on the third tey
[0:34:57] <raikagelord1> Or Revenants
[0:35:02] <grimshuck> *can
[0:35:04] <brambobelurkin> this game in general gave me heavy Quake vibes. Some gave me heavy Unreal vibes too
[0:35:06] <@Solidus_113> Command & Control is my favourite ambient track in the game
[0:35:07] <+OrochiRion> wait, no csb today?

[0:35:31] <Snakes_dk> Bruh
[0:35:32] <Nested_Dreams> Sticky spam on marauder is a valid combo
[0:35:33] <dinnydanny777> Does the chainsaw count as a glory kill?
[0:35:45] <brambobelurkin> Nice
[0:35:52] <%lewdskeletor13> It would be funny if they threw the marauder at you
[0:35:59] <brambobelurkin> @dinnydanny777 No it drops health but much smaller amounts though
[0:36:13] <%TheREALGirthMan> Wrong shotgun tho
[0:36:25] <dan_g_v> inwas wondering why the shotty
[0:36:28] <ralphfromdk> I need health, gimme yours!!
[0:36:39] <raikagelord1> Does blowing up Manccubus cannons count towards stick Mastery?
[0:36:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Fear not you can’t die in here
[0:36:40] <+TheBigTaco> I wonder what happens if you die in here
[0:36:49] <a_tube_of_lube> watching this stream BC a PS4 or Xbox 1 is literally 1200 bucks in northern Canada, internet is cheaper

[0:46:12] <TheShockVox> Got ham thanks
[0:46:13] <%tearfuldevil> @akman14 im all for shitting on Bethsda, either the publisher or the game studio, but if someone doens't finish their job when given an extension, well.....
[0:46:18] <%TheREALGirthMan> @akman14 He completed the tracks but he didn't master most of them
[0:46:21] <TheShockVox> Gotcha*
[0:46:22] <%Javaa01> It's during one DEPLOYMENT
[0:46:22] <%Shishi1205> One "deployment"
[0:46:26] <+TheBigTaco> no reggie, thats not how it works
[0:46:27] <jeosadn> One deploy
[0:46:28] <megamonmon123> its one volley
[0:46:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> you can't put turret mode away
[0:46:30] <+arancet> @WoolieVersus "one deploy" means don't let go of the triple barrel, doesnt mean you have to fire the whole time
[0:46:30] <%Lightwolfe> you cant disable the turret
[0:46:31] <RunningNGunning> You can stop mid deploy
[0:46:32] <%lewdskeletor13> It was Id too, not Bethesda
[0:46:35] <%Javaa01> You have to KEEP HOLDING L2
[0:46:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just don't stop holding the triple barrel
[0:46:40] <Tha_Mik> Staying on turret mode
[0:46:43] <%Amardeux> LUL
[0:46:43] <+bigb00gi3> Hold right click and kill 5 guys while still holding it
[0:46:46] <laguerrilha> deploy, keep the 3 turrents out
[0:46:46] <%Lightwolfe> dont put the barrels away
[0:46:47] <%Shishi1205> Just dont realease l2
[0:46:53] <+mechslayer71> Words mean things :)
[0:46:56] <+bigb00gi3> but you can use like 3-bullet bursts to kill trash
[0:46:56] <cochramd1992> you always do that Woolie
[0:46:57] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Just don't forget. The BFG 10000 is firing.
[0:46:57] <RunningNGunning> Its a lot easier than the description makes it seem
[0:47:01] <+slimmixrp> I think you must keep the turret mode active though
[0:47:03] <laguerrilha> dont release L2
[0:47:09] <blue6sub6remnant6> Chat is always wrong.

[0:47:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> JUST DON'T FOLD IT BACK TO NORMAL MODE
[0:47:11] <jeosadn> A deploy is don't let go of the mod button
[0:47:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't overheat, and don't let go of l2
[0:47:13] <%tearfuldevil> jsut hold L2
[0:47:13] <derap41> hold L2
[0:47:15] <%TheREALGirthMan> Deployment = L2
[0:47:15] <+FennecZephyr> @WoolieVersus If you release L2 it doesnt count
[0:47:16] <raikagelord1> stay on Turret mode.
[0:47:16] <ralphfromdk> You have to stay in turret mode, you can't go back into normal gun mode
[0:47:23] <%tearfuldevil> don'and don't overheat

[0:48:38] <+Cal2994> To be fair this soundtrack must of been a much bigger undertaking than in doom 2016
[0:48:41] <%Gruhunchously> Doom Slayer says look both ways
[0:48:47] <RunningNGunning> Better check both ways, you might get run over by a Pinkie Kappa
[0:48:50] <dinnydanny777> This song is like 5 minutes of build up so far

[0:50:15] <%lewdskeletor13> The UAC were the friends we made along the way
[0:50:16] <dinnydanny777> The buildup has now ceased, the music has now "popped off"
[0:50:23] <%TheREALGirthMan> @VJdarkworld I mean again, I get it, but he went out of his way to be vague and try shifting all the blame to Bethesda and Id AFTER the game was delayed 4 months and AFTER they offered him numerous extensions to finish work on a product he told them he could deliver
[0:50:26] <+TheNeonGraveyard> BFG 10000 is firing
[0:50:26] <@Solidus_113> RIP AND TEAR FASTER
[0:50:27] <%Gruhunchously> Maybe we were the UAC all along
[0:50:29] <heart_ablaze> the real UAC was in our hearts the whole time

[0:51:18] <heart_ablaze> better than any fireworks
[0:51:19] <laguerrilha> does the armored one count for the challange?
[0:51:19] <%dekkitout> "The lights in the sky are BFG's"
[0:51:23] <Kidbizzaro> The product of the fevered dreams of madmen, and mankind's own desperation. The BFG 10,000 has not stopped firing since the beginning of the demonic invasion.
[0:51:26] <cochramd1992> so is he going to use the plasma gun or what?>
[0:51:29] <dinnydanny777> Maybe the UAC was the friends we made along the way
[0:51:30] <%Gruhunchously> A Doom/DMC crossover would be pretty sick, not gonna lie
[0:51:33] <%Shishi1205> Did he do a flip?
[0:51:33] <DeathByPoke7> TOD
[0:51:37] <dukenux> he did a flip!

[0:52:20] <+slimmixrp> All that ordinacen for one dude
[0:52:21] <%soniccody12> @lewdskeletor13 Good Question
[0:52:24] <%TheREALGirthMan> @dinnydanny777 "Which half do you want to keep?"
[0:52:25] <dukenux> Keep your seatbelts fastened while BFG 10000 is firing
[0:52:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> NEVER
[0:52:33] <dukenux> which one?
[0:52:34] <%lewdskeletor13> Friendly Pentagrams
[0:52:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS THE BEST
[0:52:39] <Ner234> Hey guys what is the BFG doing right now? I can't hear over all this metal.
[0:52:39] <shin_marx> it's snatcher on a shotgun
[0:52:39] <+TheOneCalledRock> meat hook is AMAZING
[0:52:40] <stratunes> did i miss the maurader battle in this livestream?
[0:52:41] <grimshuck> @daemonazaezal cyber mancubi guns can't be damaged. they're reinforced.
[0:52:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> Super shotgun is always the best
[0:52:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the sound of picking up armor is the best
[0:52:46] <derap41> Steak is always good
[0:52:47] <%Gruhunchously> @lewdskeletor13 They might be able to form a tenuous alliance
[0:52:49] <+arancet> @stratunes yes
[0:52:49] <+Cal2994> Reverse snatch
[0:52:50] <President_valentine> My favorite gun
[0:52:50] <%lewdskeletor13> SSG is my fave gun
[0:52:59] <+TheNeonGraveyard> LUCIFER'S BANE
[0:53:00] <laguerrilha> The plasma riffle firing sounds are not as good as the Doom 1-3

[0:54:09] <ralphfromdk> Rule 1 of doing that challenge: only do it with the little fodder enemies

[0:55:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Nomad94 Nope
[0:55:09] <laguerrilha> You dont need to take the shield out, shoot the sled and they will lose phase 1
[0:55:12] <+TheNeonGraveyard> It's possible the BFG 10k is firing. We can't be certain.
[0:55:17] <%SuperKirby24> @lewdskeletor13 WHAT, WHAT'S THE BFG 10000 DOING AGAIN? Kappa

[0:57:14] <megamonmon123> yep
[0:57:14] <venomfury86> yes
[0:57:19] <+TheNeonGraveyard> I can't say for certain that the BFG 10k is NOT firing so maybe
[0:57:20] <valriot> Sometimes I wish Woolie never did QA
[0:57:21] <%user_naim> WARNING: BFG 10000 IS FIRING!
[0:57:30] <%TheREALGirthMan> Go into the dripping wet progress hole Kappa
[0:57:32] <ExpressNode> Oh shit just found out there's some protest at my workplace
[0:57:33] <derap41> At this point they should just warn when the BFG isn't firing
[0:57:39] <heart_ablaze> wait, what's firing???
[0:57:40] <%StaceMcGate> Sometimes I wish Woolie had never seen Naruto
[0:57:41] <megamonmon123> gg
[0:57:44] <DedlokPM> @Shishi1205 they knew it was progress. they were trying to figure out the secret location
[0:57:45] <%SuperKirby24> Can someone please tell me what the BFG 10000 is doing? Kappa

[0:57:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @SuperKirby24 cooling down
[0:57:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Schrodingers BFG: the BFG 10k is both firing and not firing until we get there
[0:58:07] <akman14> Aw lawrd its firing
[0:58:09] <Ner234> Guys you can't just keep adding more numbers to the BFG....
[0:58:15] <%Shishi1205> I know, we tried to let them know because we knew they would try to find it with no success
[0:58:17] <treacherously_> They shootin!
[0:58:23] <%Gruhunchously> In the event that you are unable to escape the blast radius of the BFG 10000, secure yourself behind a solid object to increase the chance that your remains will remain intact enough for study.
[0:58:28] <+JingKaisean> HAHA BIG GUN BIG NUMBER GO BOOM
[0:58:29] <%paladinstarbuster> What is the BFG actually shhoting at?

[0:59:07] <+garbocardboardington> vineWah
[0:59:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you gotta put away the turret first
[0:59:08] <%Javaa01> So even if you kill 10 in one go, you only get one point of progress
[0:59:11] <%lewdskeletor13> FeelsBadMan
[0:59:17] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe the Big Friendly Giant would do this
[0:59:18] <daemonazaezal> you need a streak of 5 or more 10 times

[1:12:31] <brambobelurkin> nope

[1:12:32] <heart_ablaze> no
[1:12:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no they're there but they're smaller
[1:12:34] <cochramd1992> why are you like this Woolie
[1:12:34] <Tha_Mik> Weakens them
[1:12:36] <%Camail> you hear a sound cue when they break
[1:12:36] <+garbocardboardington> They were already broke
[1:12:36] <derap41> Nah this isn't Metal Arms
[1:12:37] <ralphfromdk> No, they turn in to small shitty guns
[1:12:39] <%TheREALGirthMan> They get a huge downgrade when they break
[1:12:39] <%Javaa01> Read the BFG codex
[1:12:42] <stanlychicken> Small pee pee cannons are broken ones
[1:12:45] <+johnny_gogo> Get rid of flames i think
[1:12:46] <SainEdge> the arms are super big if they are not broken
[1:12:46] <+TheNeonGraveyard> They lose the flamethrower when they break
[1:12:55] <heart_ablaze> you're learning this now???
[1:12:56] <+TheBigTaco> you also finished the challenge
[1:13:01] <VJdarkworld> succubus ugly cousin the mancubis
[1:13:03] <derap41> I haven't played that game in Years
[1:13:06] <%rosemon5001> lets call the mancubi the peter griffin demons
[1:13:07] <@Solidus_113> You drop the damage potential when breaking parts
[1:13:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> can they still fuck up the ground when they break?
[1:13:18] <RichochetForce> Yes
[1:13:22] <%thesyndrome> missed shells
[1:13:25] <RichochetForce> The gas pip is a tiny blip
[1:13:25] <DedlokPM> yeah it is kinda hard
[1:13:27] <+garbocardboardington> Yeah, it’s dumb
[1:13:30] <+johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus you can make the hud bigger
[1:13:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:13:31] <RunningNGunning> Listen for the gas soundeffect for the refill
[1:13:31] <venomfury86> isn't here BFG ammo?
[1:13:32] <+404cp> theres a ui scaling option
[1:13:32] <+arancet> this ui color also makes it harder
[1:13:33] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus blame your UI colour
[1:13:39] <+TheBigTaco> well you have the UI color where everything is red
[1:13:40] <+404cp> you can make the uii bigger
[1:13:44] <laguerrilha> the HUD is too small
[1:13:46] <penitentpentwitch> Having 2 pips of gas sucks, because now you're on the fence to save until you find the third or not.
[1:13:47] <RichochetForce> @404cp Scaling the UI for one element? No way
[1:13:48] <megamonmon123> you can?
[1:13:56] <%paladinstarbuster> I dont think woolie has killed one big demon with a chainsaw this whole LP
[1:13:58] <VJdarkworld> imagine if eternal had gg strive UI
[1:13:59] <%thesyndrome> BACK
[1:14:00] <+404cp> well youd have to scale the whole thing
[1:14:03] <%thesyndrome> SECRet
[1:14:05] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus don't forget the bfg codex and the challenge
[1:14:06] <megamonmon123> @paladinstarbuster he has
[1:14:07] <%thesyndrome> destroy wall
[1:14:07] <RunningNGunning> That ground shock wave thing the mancubus does is the fucking worst on Nightmare
[1:14:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> later
[1:14:12] <Yummy_Nukes> could just switch up the ui color and see if it helps
[1:14:13] <Kidbizzaro> Progress Hole seems to be a theme in this game.
[1:14:18] <brambobelurkin> I just visualize Doom Slayer running at top speed pouring gas into the chainsaw and leaving a pool of gas everywhere.
[1:14:21] <razieltano123> Break wall on the back
[1:14:22] <megamonmon123> he did this session even @paladinstarbuster
[1:14:23] <%thesyndrome> go back you missed a secret wall

[1:14:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> back
[1:14:38] <@Solidus_113> missed a breakable wall
[1:14:41] <RichochetForce> @RunningNGunning Mancubi, Death Knights, Whiplashes, and Carcasses are a DEADLY combination in Nightmare

[1:21:04] <derap41> guy*
[1:21:07] <Leddy_at_Home> Iirc, this are actually assets from 2016 that they reused, but actually worked in a story reason to be reused
[1:21:12] <ulcaban> Pretty sure getting shot out of a cannon is Doomguy's larm clock
[1:21:18] <+garbocardboardington> I like Isaac, but doomguy owned that
[1:21:21] <@Solidus_113> SourPls

[1:22:14] <DeathByPoke7> that was sick
[1:22:17] <derap41> Pog aquired
[1:22:19] <mark_collins45> Doom 64 had a great soundtrack. It was great ambience.

[1:22:20] <heart_ablaze> *tentacle
[1:22:20] <%Javaa01> Or just chainsaw the tentacle
[1:22:23] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Amazing that these vinyls are in such good condition
[1:22:28] <%kapcommunist> ohhhh, those are the cookies ive hears about lol
[1:22:39] <%Javaa01> You can get longer freeze
[1:22:46] <Leddy_at_Home> Complete Ice Grenades
[1:23:01] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Get Oreos for upgrades
[1:23:05] <$legacy0117> Isaac flew himself through space, Doomguy just shot himself out of an anti-ship turret. Which sounds better to you??
[1:23:09] <%thesyndrome> go for that
[1:23:13] <%thesyndrome> ice bomb is amazing
[1:23:13] <laguerrilha> with the scather you dmg becomes HUGE
[1:23:17] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Ice grenades are so good
[1:23:18] <venomfury86> the Quake Champions track is awesome
[1:23:31] <%thesyndrome> you cant improve the BFG
[1:23:33] <RunningNGunning> Can't improve perfection Kappa
[1:23:35] <dinnydanny777> Argent Ammo
[1:23:35] <%thesyndrome> its perfection
[1:23:40] <%Javaa01> Don't shoot it at an enemy, shoot it PAST an enemy
[1:23:41] <cochramd1992> PERFECTION
[1:23:43] <derap41> Yeah don't hit the floor
[1:23:50] <laguerrilha> yeah, dont hit enemies. give it air time
[1:23:53] <Tha_Mik> Shoot the air
[1:23:53] <ralphfromdk> Don't fire it AT demons, you fire it NEAR demons
[1:24:00] <@Solidus_113> BFG ammo also appears on the map
[1:24:02] <cochramd1992> no, shoot at the enemy in the back, past all the other enemies
[1:24:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Air time more important than direct hit
[1:24:05] <venomfury86> yes
[1:24:09] <%Shishi1205> Tendrils look for near demons auto
[1:24:15] <SpaceGuntank> the longer its in the air the more time the tendrils have time to kill demons
[1:24:17] <mdkcde> Don't be like pat and shot it at a wall or floors
[1:24:19] <%thesyndrome> @ralphfromdk to be fair, the main BFG ball hitting a big target is also viable
[1:24:20] <heart_ablaze> @woolieversus GFG ammo appears on the map like secrets
[1:24:24] <%Irridium> you can do that?!
[1:24:27] <+TheNeonGraveyard> The longer the BFG shot is in the air, the stronger it will become
[1:24:29] <%Double_Tap_That> Holy shit I didn't know you could do that.
[1:24:31] <+garbocardboardington> 3/3
[1:24:32] <DeathByPoke7> Squid1 Squid4
[1:24:34] <Snakes_dk> never tried that
[1:24:39] <shinbobross> YOU CAN CHAINSAW THOSE?!
[1:24:41] <ElkRiverDog> coxSeafood coxSoup
[1:24:49] <%Javaa01> It's free ammo
[1:24:52] <%soniccody12> Ok
[1:24:54] <thatonepassionbentgamer> welp
[1:24:54] <%Javaa01> Always saw em
[1:24:55] <huskarl_zap> psaBig psaWrong
[1:24:59] <%soniccody12> GOOD TO KNOW!!!
[1:25:03] <megamonmon123> learning new things from woolie
[1:25:05] <ralphfromdk> thesyndrome But then it stops and you don't get all those lovely tendrils of murder
[1:25:06] <%SuperKirby24> Wait, people didnt do that?
[1:25:10] <megamonmon123> nope
[1:25:14] <Leddy_at_Home> Oh yeah @WoolieVersus, did you hear about the cut pistol in this game? it's still on the code and it's a straight upgrade to 2016's, like literally, it's even a 3-round burst
[1:25:15] <AnarkyF1oyd> You guys didn't know?
[1:25:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah I didn’t find that out till my second playthrough
[1:25:18] <BettyMwwaahh> anyone else feel like there werent alot of powerups in levels like the previous Doom?
[1:25:19] <mark_collins45> They whip up so fast the first instinct is to shoot those bastards
[1:25:20] <venomfury86> try the BFG with the infinite ammo cheat LUL
[1:25:24] <thatonepassionbentgamer> i always stickied them
[1:25:31] <megamonmon123> yep
[1:25:31] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s super fun
[1:25:32] <%Javaa01> That hook is an intended skip
[1:25:32] <+garbocardboardington> I’ll on YOUR slaught
[1:25:34] <stratunes> i knew that was a skip!
[1:25:35] <RunningNGunning> The regular speedrun already is basically using cheatcodes
[1:25:38] <+Ether101_Prime> Some of the cheats screw with the physics.
[1:25:42] <%Javaa01> So you don't have to go into this tentacle pit
[1:25:48] <%SuperKirby24> the thing is you had to be super quick about it or else yoou get hit and you get out of range of using the chainsaw tho
[1:25:55] <venomfury86> i tried using the chainsaw on the tentacles
[1:25:57] <vampireinarm> The speed run involves a lot of launching yourself HIGH HIGH into the air and sequence breaking the fuck out of everything
[1:26:00] <%thesyndrome> good map
[1:26:06] <akman14> Will we reach sentinel prime this episode?
[1:26:13] <%Javaa01> You can get back to it
[1:26:16] <%Javaa01> Without a reload
[1:26:18] <RunningNGunning> rip
[1:26:22] <%SuperKirby24> F
[1:26:22] <%Javaa01> Just go around the corner to the left
[1:26:22] <megamonmon123> its fiiiine
[1:26:31] <Yummy_Nukes> YOU CAN GO BACK
[1:26:31] <%Shishi1205> There's a elevator or sth
[1:26:32] <hukurowl> nbd
[1:26:32] <Treuan> Remember we can teleport at the end
[1:26:33] <megamonmon123> youll get back
[1:26:33] <Kidbizzaro> You can always fast travel later
[1:26:33] <ralphfromdk> No, you will get back there with teleporters, no worries :D
[1:26:35] <penitentpentwitch> There's a way back up, if I remember right
[1:26:35] <megamonmon123> dont worry
[1:26:36] <venomfury86> check the latest speedrun by Xamide
[1:26:38] <%Kazuhira_Boat> its fine
[1:26:41] <@Solidus_113> look how bad you fucked mars
[1:26:42] <derap41> This place looks familiar
[1:26:43] <RogueMinja> You can get back up there.
[1:27:01] <+garbocardboardington> Omg
[1:27:05] <derap41> I think Gordon Killed some Demons here
[1:27:06] <+404cp> You can just punch the barrels to get your ammo instead of shooting them
[1:27:07] <MKII> doomguy is probably responsible for the moon too
[1:27:17] <ralphfromdk> And this is how you get back up there :D
[1:27:53] <$legacy0117> Depends of he has explosive resistance or not.
[1:27:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:27:57] <venomfury86> this one was clutch for me
[1:27:58] <megamonmon123> close
[1:27:59] <%Irridium> so fun fact you can super get here by jumping/dashing into the vent up top. It's finicky as fuck but possible
[1:28:08] <%Reveresao> blade gun
[1:28:09] <heart_ablaze> bfg worthy
[1:28:09] <%thesyndrome> chainsaw first enemy
[1:28:10] <%SuperKirby24> spent hours trying to find this secret only to find out its one of those progression secrets Kappa
[1:28:11] <megamonmon123> you can do this
[1:28:21] <%Javaa01> Minigun the grunts at the start
[1:28:35] <%Shishi1205> @chesterr01 A tip for the L2 of the plasma gun, its a "shotgun like" shockwave meaning be near them, and it charges up using ammo so having it full and not using it is waisting resources
[1:28:36] <%Reveresao> use the balista
[1:28:50] <venomfury86> use the Bautista
[1:28:52] <%Lightwolfe> ????
[1:28:56] <cochramd1992> amazing
[1:29:00] <%thesyndrome> glory kills are too slow
[1:29:03] <Ner234> Holy shit
[1:29:05] <%thesyndrome> you need to murder them hard
[1:29:05] <@Solidus_113> Arbalest
[1:29:12] <derap41> half a second late
[1:29:13] <masterfire23> doomslayer seems a bit tilted
[1:29:15] <+johnny_gogo> BFG
[1:29:16] <mark_collins45> Rockets are good for these.
[1:29:16] <Nested_Dreams> The controller is breaking?
[1:29:18] <%Irridium> you know mobile turret is really good at killing really fast
[1:29:18] <penitentpentwitch> What triggered the swearing?
[1:29:18] <megamonmon123> spam everything
[1:29:21] <RogueMinja> BFG it.
[1:29:24] <+santafer> freeze the little girl?
[1:29:25] <AnarkyF1oyd> try to not glory kill on secret encounter it make you slow
[1:29:28] <%Javaa01> If you wanna glorykill, then swap for faster glory kills, you don't need slowmo for this
[1:29:30] <$legacy0117> BFG suggested.
[1:29:31] <+johnny_gogo> YEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[1:29:34] <venomfury86> sub-zero that shit
[1:29:35] <FeelinNifty> heh heh yeeeaaaahhhh

[1:29:50] <heart_ablaze> LUL
[1:29:51] <%Lightwolfe> ???
[1:29:54] <SuperChumps> waste
[1:29:54] <+johnny_gogo> Its fine
[1:29:54] <+Donutjulio> the rune to make enemies stagger longer solves the kills being too long
[1:29:54] <megamonmon123> welp
[1:29:54] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:29:55] <penitentpentwitch> Still worth
[1:29:55] <derap41> and he Whiffed it
[1:29:55] <FeelinNifty> winner
[1:29:55] <%Irridium> gotta make sure it travels
[1:29:57] <Tha_Mik> We take those
[1:29:58] <%SuperKirby24> kewl
[1:30:00] <+Scawaly> what difficulty on?
[1:30:00] <shinbobross> Woof
[1:30:01] <%Javaa01> What a waste
[1:30:06] <ralphfromdk> When you hit something with the BFG head on it will stop dead.
[1:30:09] <megamonmon123> @scawaly hurt me plenty
[1:30:11] <+garbocardboardington> Oof
[1:30:11] <%rosemon5001> op wep that needs to travel aim at the ground
[1:30:11] <mark_collins45> BFG needs time to fly
[1:30:12] <astrophizz> don't aim at the ground
[1:30:14] <%Lightwolfe> are you okay? Do you have brain damage?
[1:30:14] <megamonmon123> its fine
[1:30:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is why air time is important with BFG
[1:30:19] <RichochetForce> Yeah, Destroyer Blade, Chain Gun, BFG, Ice Bomb, Wide Rockets are kings at challenges.
[1:30:25] <venomfury86> Nice
[1:30:28] <penitentpentwitch> Correct!
[1:30:32] <megamonmon123> its fiiiiiiiine
[1:30:32] <@Solidus_113> yes. this is what you read in the Codex
[1:30:32] <derap41> And don't hit the floor
[1:30:32] <$legacy0117> Well there will be more ammo for it.
[1:30:34] <stratunes> fire the bfg in the air for max use
[1:30:40] <Leddy_at_Home> Did you guys hear about the cut pistol in the game? it's an straight upgrade to the 2016 one, like literally, it's even a 3-round burst.
[1:30:44] <+Mkingston> PS5 event postponed.
[1:30:46] <Nested_Dreams> Whenever I hear Woolie say 'her' while playing doom, I hear Olivia
[1:30:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> BFG is the disco ball of Doom. Don't let the party stop early.
[1:30:49] <penitentpentwitch> Look up in that green room
[1:30:50] <+johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus that also means that big guys need direct hits
[1:30:55] <%SuperKirby24> rip
[1:30:55] <+garbocardboardington> HE CAN BE TAUGHT
[1:30:59] <Nested_Dreams> Snakelivia Pierce
[1:31:18] <Leddy_at_Home> YEah
[1:31:21] <Leddy_at_Home> To June 4
[1:31:21] <%thesyndrome> ?
[1:31:32] <taquito_blade> lol disorienting isnt it?
[1:31:35] <akman14> Well . this IS space
[1:31:38] <%FusRoDom> Got flipped turned upside down
[1:31:43] <%Javaa01> And now you can make progress for a while
[1:31:46] <venomfury86> i agree with Pat about the BFG being better than the other gun
[1:31:48] <@Solidus_113> look how bad you fucked mars
[1:31:50] <+Donutjulio> Bfg in this game at least isn't as convoluted as the originals
[1:31:51] <RunningNGunning> LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID TO MARS
[1:31:56] <+Mkingston> @Leddy_at_Home June 4th event is postponed
[1:31:58] <%thesyndrome> NO GRAPPLING
[1:32:08] <$legacy0117> Pistol is always reserved for emergencies in DOOM. This game hands you the basic shotgun first.
[1:32:25] <taquito_blade> i miss having a pistol in eternal
[1:32:26] <penitentpentwitch> I always felt the BFG was for room clearing and the Unmaykr was for bosses
[1:32:32] <stratunes> shootda big red can it go boom
[1:32:32] <Leddy_at_Home> Oh, I though it was postponed to the 4th
[1:32:37] <RichochetForce> Pistols are pointless in Doom. They serve no purpose
[1:32:41] <Leddy_at_Home> Also yeah, the pistol in this game would've been fucking insane
[1:32:44] <%thesyndrome> ....
[1:32:47] <heart_ablaze> LUL
[1:32:49] <Leddy_at_Home> Specially from what we've seen of it
[1:32:50] <%DesertPenguin> Maybe look where you're going LUL
[1:32:50] <RichochetForce> @penitentpentwitch Yeah, Unmakyr murders bosses
[1:32:52] <$legacy0117> And the Chainsaw.
[1:32:53] <megamonmon123> dont jump
[1:32:55] <RichochetForce> Unfortunately it shares ammo with the BFG
[1:33:00] <Tha_Mik> Let it rock
[1:33:01] <%DesertPenguin> Unmakyr sucks
[1:33:02] <+Mkingston> @Leddy_at_Home Nope. due to the current event with police riots
[1:33:08] <penitentpentwitch> Don't jump when you've used a boost pads, they always land you safely
[1:33:12] <taquito_blade> well with how much ammo you use in a single fight, itd be nice with infini ammo but the chainsaw exists for that
[1:33:24] <%DesertPenguin> video games
[1:33:28] <%thesyndrome> just space shit
[1:33:39] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus take a good look at the mars crater while you have a ncie view
[1:33:45] <@Solidus_113> every time
[1:33:46] <%DesertPenguin> Stop going out of your way for that turret challenge
[1:34:01] <venomfury86> @woolieversus in the PC version there's actually a pistol hidden in the code
[1:34:01] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus There will be places were you can go full auto with the chaingun in future levels. So don't worry.
[1:34:01] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus you can blow up the giant exploding barrels floating in space.
[1:34:10] <cochramd1992> yeah you're already halfway there, focus on BFG kills instead
[1:34:12] <RichochetForce> Please look at Mars
[1:34:12] <penitentpentwitch> I got into the habit of flaming things as part of a glory kill
[1:34:14] <@Solidus_113> YOU FUCKED MARS
[1:34:18] <%MrTurtleThief> Punching the exploding barrels is very on brand LUL
[1:34:21] <%thesyndrome> you blew up part of a planet, fucked gravbity is kinda expected
[1:34:23] <%DesertPenguin> penitent that's how you do it
[1:34:30] <taquito_blade> "you cant just shoot a hole into mars"
[1:34:36] <%lewdskeletor13> You shot a hole in the surface of mars
[1:34:38] <derap41> Some Idiot shot a hole in mars

[1:36:06] <+Donutjulio> The ai on the shield guy is so annoying it's amazing

[1:36:35] <megamonmon123> yeah
[1:36:38] <%DesertPenguin> You had that the whole time
[1:36:40] <+johnny_gogo> He was in it
[1:36:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:36:44] <%thesyndrome> yeah, well we were screaming at you
[1:36:48] <cochramd1992> it was easier, you just wouldn't use it
[1:36:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is why you must your eyeballs
[1:36:49] <%Irridium> it was always there LUL
[1:36:51] <derap41> BFG ammo is like RPG potions you never end up using it
[1:36:56] <heart_ablaze> adumHmm
[1:36:56] <%SuperKirby24> welp now you have some for later LUL
[1:36:58] <Leddy_at_Home> GOD THE SKY BOX
[1:36:59] <astrophizz> it was there the whole time
[1:37:00] <+TheBigTaco> "old fashioned way"
[1:37:00] <Leddy_at_Home> IT'S SO GOOD
[1:37:02] <sniffy77> I love u guys but im screaming
[1:37:02] <mark_collins45> BFA for the BFG
[1:37:05] <megamonmon123> yeah
[1:37:06] <RichochetForce> lol
[1:37:07] <%DesertPenguin> Sometimes they give it to you to sort of suggest "Hey, we gave it to you specifically for this fight otherwise it would be overwhelming"
[1:37:08] <grimshuck> @razieltano123 ammo was right there, he's blind as fuck
[1:37:10] <%DesertPenguin> BARELY
[1:37:11] <ghostspartan80> nice job surviving without it at least
[1:37:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GIT GUD
[1:37:14] <penitentpentwitch> Nope, too busy murdering to see
[1:37:17] <taquito_blade> honestly prolly not
[1:37:17] <+johnny_gogo> Ur good hater gonna hate
[1:37:20] <stormhawk9891> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:37:23] <@Solidus_113> Brain capacity at 100%
[1:37:25] <megamonmon123> lp tax + doom combat =brain fried woolie
[1:37:26] <mark_collins45> I always treat the BFG like a cheat button.
[1:37:26] <%nepwar> woolie do he best
[1:37:27] <%DesertPenguin> If they give you BFG Ammo, it's usually because you'll need it
[1:37:28] <megamonmon123> its cool woolie
[1:37:35] <taquito_blade> bullet time perk helps ngl
[1:37:40] <%thesyndrome> destroyer blade is kinda shitty, arbalest is better, it 2 shots cacodemons
[1:37:42] <%Lightwolfe> Other mod for flyers
[1:37:43] <lotharrio> So how many super meters are in this? There's BFG, blood punch, chainsaw...
[1:37:45] <derap41> That last look he gives you is so good
[1:37:50] <+seduwu> pain
[1:37:50] <%DesertPenguin> Flame Belch...
[1:37:52] <ghostspartan80> looks cool at least
[1:37:53] <%Lion_kun> Woolie has this bad habit of hesitating with indecision
[1:37:59] <venomfury86> save it for the Slayer Gate
[1:37:59] <stratunes> i think it's more interesting that woolie is adapting from a 2d perspective into a 3d fps perspective.
[1:38:17] <derap41> Plop
[1:38:17] <penitentpentwitch> Good use of flame!
[1:38:22] <%Shishi1205> yes
[1:38:22] <%thesyndrome> you can
[1:38:24] <taquito_blade> yes
[1:38:25] <hukurowl> lol nice
[1:38:26] <Tha_Mik> Nice
[1:38:26] <%thesyndrome> ]they also drop ammo
[1:38:34] <%DesertPenguin> Yea buddy
[1:38:34] <DedlokPM> @Lion_kun a lot of people do. It's called being human
[1:38:37] <cochramd1992> "can you shoot these barrels" he asks Kappa
[1:38:38] <%DesertPenguin> For that reason
[1:38:45] <SpaceGuntank> they respawn if you have the perk for it LUL
[1:39:00] <%DesertPenguin> Always with the side dash hook
[1:39:06] <%thesyndrome> extra laife above you
[1:39:06] <%DesertPenguin> Stylish points
[1:39:08] <venomfury86> try a cacodemon glory kill from behind
[1:39:09] <thatonepassionbentgamer> why do we need big boomy barrels? SHUTTUP JOHNSON ITS FOR PROGRESS
[1:39:13] <%Shishi1205> go back
[1:39:16] <derap41> hmm seems someone poked a hole in mars
[1:39:16] <%Shishi1205> Then jump
[1:39:18] <%thesyndrome> I think you have to go down and around the find a jumping platform to the top
[1:39:24] <ralphfromdk> Level is almost over, better start shooting that bfg
[1:39:29] <DDDorsett> Not worth it
[1:39:32] <%Lion_kun> But Woolie literally freezes up deciding to pick a weapon instead plof staying mobile
[1:39:36] <taquito_blade> port back to map start near end of mission
[1:39:36] <megamonmon123> you good woolie
[1:39:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> @thatonepassionbentgamer YEAH fuck you Johnson you prick
[1:39:48] <%Shishi1205> Nice
[1:39:50] <venomfury86> save the bfg for the gate
[1:39:52] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:39:54] <%DesertPenguin> big barrel
[1:39:58] <%thesyndrome> oh shit I didnt know the explosion was that big and strong
[1:40:04] <+Mictlan93> that worked??
[1:40:04] <ghostspartan80> freeze + chaingun is a good combo for barons
[1:40:05] <%Lightwolfe> welp
[1:40:09] <%Double_Tap_That> Imagine if you didn't have barrel immunity
[1:40:16] <taquito_blade> LOL
[1:40:23] <mark_collins45> those barrels will respawn too
[1:40:25] <RichochetForce> @ghostspartan80 It's a work of ART
[1:40:45] <ghostspartan80> damn straight
[1:40:47] <mark_collins45> I had sweaty palms this entire section.
[1:40:55] <+toastybites> !uptime
[1:40:56] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 41 minutes
[1:40:58] <%DesertPenguin> air control would help
[1:41:01] <RichochetForce> @mark_collins45 Same
[1:41:07] <+slimmixrp> Just land normally
[1:41:10] <+slimmixrp> Then jump
[1:41:10] <DDDorsett> Not Worth it tbh
[1:41:11] <penitentpentwitch> Land after the bounce, then jump
[1:41:16] <+garbocardboardington> vineLuigi
[1:41:19] <ghostspartan80> follow the compass if you're stuck
[1:41:21] <thatonepassionbentgamer> ...imagine Doomguy with the Portal Gun
[1:41:23] <%thesyndrome> you can do it after landing from jumppad
[1:41:25] <%Javaa01> Just land and go from the 2nd platform
[1:41:27] <d4nsteele> who is woolie sitting with
[1:41:31] <%thesyndrome> double jump and dashes are enough
[1:41:37] <%DesertPenguin> LUL
[1:41:37] <%Zayasu> pat
[1:41:37] <%Javaa01> Woolie jumped
[1:41:38] <TheyCallMeVawn> Why would you jump
[1:41:39] <derap41> Bounced right off
[1:41:44] <%Lightwolfe> Blackface Pat
[1:41:44] <negrosnake9185> You can’t fight gravity John
[1:41:44] <%DesertPenguin> bounced off the electricity
[1:41:45] <hukurowl> honestly the Portal Gun would probably just slow Doomguy down
[1:41:56] <%DesertPenguin> HONK
[1:41:56] <%thesyndrome> woolie just land, then double jump and double dash
[1:41:57] <%Javaa01> """"Kind of"""""
[1:41:58] <@Solidus_113> It's just an extra life, not really worth all this effort

[1:42:15] <%Shishi1205> back
[1:42:19] <%Irridium> behind you
[1:42:19] <penitentpentwitch> If Doom Guy got the portal gun, I'd assume he'd just start trying to get 'Portal Cut' Glory Kills
[1:42:24] <daemonazaezal> you have to go back again
[1:42:26] <%DesertPenguin> left
[1:42:28] <%DesertPenguin> go left

[1:44:51] <dinnydanny777> Doom has always been about big platforming
[1:44:52] <ghostspartan80> don't you dare waste it now
[1:44:55] <negrosnake9185> Yay
[1:45:01] <dinnydanny777> Doom Guy is basically Mario

[1:45:11] <hukurowl> do both!!
[1:45:15] <penitentpentwitch> Sniper machine gun!
[1:45:22] <derap41> And that was all it took to kill DoomGu
[1:45:25] <ghostspartan80> ballista snipe
[1:45:26] <dinnydanny777> You just need to beat Bowser's Castle to get to the boss
[1:45:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 Great now I'm imagining him with a big mario mustashce
[1:45:44] <cochramd1992> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[1:45:45] <%rosemon5001> it mercied lol
[1:45:48] <venomfury86> rough
[1:45:55] <%Javaa01> It's absolutely not worth it
[1:45:57] <%thesyndrome> not worth a bfg
[1:46:00] <venomfury86> LUL
[1:46:07] <%Javaa01> There are VERY clear moments where you would wanna BFG
[1:46:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> not worht it
[1:46:08] <%thesyndrome> trust me, save it
[1:46:09] <ralphfromdk> level is almost over, do it now or be prepared to go back and do it later
[1:46:10] <%Double_Tap_That> The sound that plays when you get a token REALLY reminds me of when you get key items in RE4.
[1:46:10] <cochramd1992> I guess?
[1:46:12] <%Irridium> it's just one enemy
[1:46:14] <%Javaa01> And those are all in big ass arenas
[1:46:14] <cochramd1992> It'll be fine?

[1:46:46] <+bigb00gi3> the 5 grenade pips are in pentagram spots, thought that was a cute detail
[1:46:57] <ralphfromdk> Other side
[1:47:08] <%Irridium> there's a place to drop down
[1:47:10] <dinnydanny777> You need to unlock Fludd to progress
[1:47:27] <%Reveresao> F
[1:47:28] <derap41> Messed up that
[1:47:29] <%Javaa01> Explosive barrels don't count for it

[1:47:59] <megamonmon123> 0/10 lp

[1:48:00] <%Javaa01> Use the weapon, and the bullets
[1:48:00] <%R3Roundabout> wut
[1:48:01] <derap41> Cause you have to kill them with the gun
[1:48:03] <Invertin> why would you get points for killing with the gun when you kill with the barrel
[1:48:04] <%Irridium> you didn't kill them with the weapon you did it with the barrel
[1:48:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> why would they/
[1:48:07] <+johnny_gogo> F
[1:48:09] <%thesyndrome> because it counts the death as "death by barrel", not whatever destroyed the barrel
[1:48:15] <+TheBigTaco> what? Why would they? thats not the challenge
[1:48:15] <AnarkyF1oyd> it's Chaingun mastery not a barrel mastery
[1:48:21] <venomfury86> imagine if he was killed by a zombie
[1:48:56] <RichochetForce> Ice Bomb mod is amazing
[1:49:09] <venomfury86> and CUT
[1:49:09] <ghostspartan80> ice bomb + chaingun

[1:49:23] <%Shishi1205> Pain elementals are chonkers
[1:49:24] <RogueMinja> Arbalest.
[1:49:30] <RichochetForce> That's one smart BRAIN elemental.
[1:49:35] <+CaptainJax> Arbalest does more damage to flying enemies
[1:49:36] <ghostspartan80> pain elemental is a cutie
[1:49:37] <%Gruhunchously> You missed the health tho
[1:49:39] <heart_ablaze> ballista does more damage to flying enemies
[1:49:49] <venomfury86> ballista
[1:49:49] <%Ghostbody> they need to read the lore on that bastard
[1:49:56] <derap41> That's still the best kill
[1:49:57] <@Solidus_113> they did
[1:50:04] <megamonmon123> @ghostbody they did
[1:50:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hes using te wrong arbalest attachment for single target tho
[1:50:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bonk
[1:50:06] <%kapcommunist> this is my type of resourse management game
[1:50:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> Pain is an element???
[1:50:22] <+CaptainJax> In hell it is
[1:50:23] <DedlokPM> @FuqBoiSlim it is in hell
[1:50:28] <penitentpentwitch> Doesn't the bounce across for this one have a bounce back?
[1:50:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @FuqBoiSlim haven't you heard of painbending?
[1:50:37] <ghostspartan80> its in constant pain so yes
[1:50:39] <grimshuck> @fuqboislim If love can be one, why not pain?
[1:50:39] <venomfury86> Allmighty Push
[1:50:39] <%Javaa01> It will cancel the momentum
[1:50:42] <derap41> @FuqBoiSlim Is water an element?
[1:50:43] <dinnydanny777> This is a fantastic 3D platforming game imo
[1:50:45] <%thesyndrome> you have to go on the jumppad, then come BACK by platforming
[1:50:47] <%Shishi1205> Yo go further then come back
[1:50:54] <dinnydanny777> Best 3D platformer in years
[1:50:58] <@Solidus_113> Is mayonnaise an element
[1:50:59] <megamonmon123> sentinel battery requires using the super jump and dashinh backwards
[1:51:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> I wanna see what the periodic table looks like in hell
[1:51:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @fuqboislim It's one of the Elements of Disharmony. Alongside Anguish, Despair, Dread, Betrayal, and Regret.
[1:51:22] <penitentpentwitch> Duracell achieved!
[1:51:27] <megamonmon123> oh i did it the jank way

[1:51:43] <%emperordread> That's half a online only mode custom skin right there
[1:51:44] <RichochetForce> No, but Mustard is.
[1:51:54] <DedlokPM> @dinnydanny777 if mayonaisse can be an instrument, ketchup can be an element
[1:51:58] <+CaptainJax> ammo
[1:52:00] <%Javaa01> Get the lower armor, since that also gets you the ammo upgrade
[1:52:07] <thatonepassionbentgamer> BLOOD PUNT
[1:52:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BLUD PUNF
[1:52:10] <%Javaa01> You have plenty of health already
[1:52:15] <%Camail> woolie is getting the pat mouth disease this session
[1:52:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ammo
[1:52:22] <ghostspartan80> more health is good
[1:52:43] <Tha_Mik> Perfectly balanced
[1:52:47] <%thesyndrome> you get more HP drops than armour, so its the better one in the end, but yeah for now ammo is needed
[1:52:51] <%Neoepochx> Sup @WoolieVersus
[1:52:52] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus just know having the health one means you'll auto pickup the big medkits to fill the punch meter
[1:53:08] <%kapcommunist> itsaulgoodman
[1:53:13] <@Solidus_113> so you'll have to avoid them in arenas
[1:53:19] <ralphfromdk> Provlers are the purple imps that teleport

[2:14:36] <cochramd1992> yeah but it's still tactically wise to take out their stingers though
[2:14:37] <peachy996> no music?
[2:14:49] <ghostspartan80> icebomb bloodpunch is good
[2:14:51] <RichochetForce> Bug
[2:14:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> might be a bug
[2:14:55] <RichochetForce> It happens sometimes
[2:14:56] <spidervenomized> THAT A PROWLER ROCKET LAUNCHER IT
[2:14:57] <%lewdskeletor13> No music is a known glitch for this part
[2:15:08] <%SuperKirby24> aw man, this is one of those encounters that's fucked on steam, when you complete it the map and progress bar doesn't change to say you completed it Kappa
[2:15:13] <%Shishi1205> He will get a mastery token for the rocket challenge
[2:15:17] <+TheOneCalledRock> did it get patched? Kappa
[2:15:20] <mark_collins45> Not having music here makes it more intense
[2:15:24] <peachy996> @lewdskeletor13 I heard it plays Super Gore Nest or nothing instead of the track it's suppose to play
[2:15:25] <%Shishi1205> The upgrade is not useful for woolie
[2:15:26] <%Javaa01> Double lock isn't worth grinding for specifically, he can just get that via Token
[2:15:27] <brambobelurkin> l2
[2:15:27] <RichochetForce> Yes
[2:15:30] <RichochetForce> Purple teleporting guys

[2:15:40] <peachy996> Which sucks because the track that's supposed to play is fucking awesome
[2:15:41] <venomfury86> i love that glory kill on the Prowler
[2:15:42] <%DesertPenguin> It's fully charged
[2:15:42] <%thesyndrome> bigger, more purple imps
[2:15:47] <penitentpentwitch> Don't worry about challenged for this room, it's a little intense
[2:15:53] <%DesertPenguin> Use the burst
[2:15:59] <%thesyndrome> I can't wait for the next level
[2:16:00] <RogueMinja> The teleporting ones, yes.

[2:16:37] <%lewdskeletor13> Ye
[2:16:38] <Cybermancer> for whatever reason this fight in particular always has the music break
[2:16:39] <penitentpentwitch> This room bugged for me the first time through, I ended the level with 9.9 pips complete.
[2:16:39] <Daxalog> Music does not come on until you get B or higher in the Style Meter

[2:28:43] <Tucker0603> @WoolieVersus i predicted in pats stream that he was and isakei protag, AND I WAS RIGHT
[2:28:44] <+Afterman_> first discoverer of hell
[2:28:45] <+eanscrale> That was doom 1
[2:28:45] <halfmasks> its his fault!

[2:28:50] <spidervenomized> HE FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION
[2:28:50] <laguerrilha> They discovered hell existed because of you
[2:28:50] <%Irridium> he fucking spanked hell
[2:28:53] <penitentpentwitch> He accidentally introduced them to hell
[2:28:53] <ghostspartan80> guess how they found out about hell
[2:28:54] <brachydios777> End of doom 64
[2:28:54] <%Shishi1205> Old armor
[2:28:56] <%lewdskeletor13> He traveled through TIME and space

[2:28:59] <%MrRabbles> Doom Guy wants to seize the unholy land

[2:29:04] <%Neoepochx> @Tucker0603 "That Time I was Teleported to Argenta from Hell"
[2:29:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HE'S THE COLUMBUS OF HELL
[2:29:06] <%kyh9> Doom 64
[2:29:14] <+CryptusMaximus> Doomguy has lived through an entire cycle of this beforehand
[2:29:17] <%thesyndrome> now he's truly Ash Williams
[2:29:17] <THELava_lad> doom 64
[2:29:21] <RichochetForce> @penitentpentwitch That must feel like shit.
[2:29:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I wonder how he got to hell tho
[2:29:21] <%Javaa01> He stayed in hell indefinitely after the end of Doom 64
[2:29:21] <Snakes_dk> so sick
[2:29:22] <+Afterman_> between 64 and doom 2016
[2:29:22] <halfmasks> THE MAGELLAN OF MALEBOLGIA
[2:29:24] <%Josef_Stryker> Doom 64
[2:29:27] <%Shishi1205> Before 2016
[2:29:27] <laguerrilha> yes
[2:29:27] <%lewdskeletor13> After Doom 64 he stayed in Hell
[2:29:29] <+TheBigTaco> DOOM 64 was the precursor
[2:29:32] <raikagelord1> @cobaltphoenix27 LUL LUL LUL
[2:29:37] <venomfury86> That's why the Betrayer said "will make the burden you carry worse"?
[2:29:45] <mark_collins45> They released a new level for Doom 64 that ties into Doom 2016
[2:29:57] <ralphfromdk> This level is all about connecting the old school games to the new ones
[2:30:01] <+Afterman_> doom guy was basically dante and vergil after dmc5
[2:30:01] <brachydios777> 1-2-64-2016-Eternal
[2:30:03] <dinnydanny777> Is Doom 2016 a prequel or a sequel?
[2:30:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So does that mean the Doom 2 Demon invasion also happened b4
[2:30:07] <%Pillagius> yeap-yeap! Plus between Doom 64 and 2016 - enough time had passed for humanity to apparently forget the whole portal experiment thing
[2:30:10] <23lolman23> 1-2-64 THIS 2016-Eternal
[2:30:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ballerswagbro9k Alternate Earth got fucked
[2:30:19] <%thesyndrome> @BallerSwagBro9k yup, that was always the case
[2:30:20] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CryptusMaximus
[2:30:21] <+Aeoneth> Those are stone slabs, not books
[2:30:22] <%Neoepochx> @BallerSwagBro9k In an alternate dimension, where he is originally from

[2:30:30] <%lewdskeletor13> @pillagius Well it seems implied that this is another universe
[2:30:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gotcha
[2:30:32] <grimshuck> Isn't kinda weird how the Khan makyr with all her collective knowledge didn't know about hell.
[2:30:32] <halfmasks> nah
[2:30:33] <%Javaa01> This level is exclusively linear, all secrets are in front of you
[2:30:35] <JetpackMcQuack> But does it have a ripatorium

[2:30:36] <RogueMinja> Nah.
[2:30:37] <+CaptainJax> Fuck outta here

[2:30:39] <Nomad94> No
[2:30:42] <+Afterman_> shes scared af
[2:30:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "hey bro we cool right"
[2:30:42] <%Gruhunchously> You guys should play Prey 2017 at some point. I'm pretty sure Mick scored that game as well.
[2:30:44] <%BisoromiBear> Please don't murder me!
[2:30:48] <%dekkitout> "Hey, gg- let's call it a draw?"
[2:30:51] <%Shishi1205> the old demons
[2:30:52] <+garbocardboardington> The fuck is a truce?
[2:30:52] <+CaptainJax> RIP in peace
[2:30:54] <%Neoepochx> Doomguy is basically space John Wick anyway.
[2:31:02] <Nomad94> What she said sounds awfully like "pleae stop ruining my plans" to me
[2:31:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Lore level
[2:31:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "agree to disagree"
[2:31:07] <Batmagoo> Chat, if something doesn't line up, it's a parallel universe
[2:31:11] <%Pillagius> @lewdskeletor13 well, not exactly. From what I gather certain someone ran off to Doomguy's universe and pulled him back into it from hell
[2:31:11] <dinnydanny777> If there weren't any demons around would Doomguy just go nuts?
[2:31:15] <peachy996> You're zen YOU MUST HAVE HUGE PATIENCE
[2:31:17] <+evbites> I wonder if he's so stressed that he's in constant pain
[2:31:18] <%thesyndrome> they tried to follow the doomguy to finish him off, and found the argenta
[2:31:37] <Nomad94> @dinnydanny777 Probably just go right back to hell to find more things to kill
[2:31:37] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[2:32:33] <%Neoepochx> The Makyrs have a lot of parallels to early "Christianization" of Pagan societies. Like how Celtics and Nordic customs got absorbed by Christianity, the Makyrs do the same to the worlds they visit.
[2:32:36] <venomfury86> Doomguy basically brought hell to the Sentinel world
[2:32:39] <laguerrilha> Notice how the demons were the classic ones in that

[2:34:40] <laguerrilha> She is talking of his Erath from the comics
[2:34:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Neoepochx Yeah i figure, after Doom2/64 when he came out of hell he arrived in an alternate dimesions....or maybe back in time
[2:34:43] <%lewdskeletor13> Big lore
[2:34:43] <+demegodz> Pumpin lore Kreygasm
[2:34:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Daisy as the Icon of Sin
[2:34:45] <sniffy77> Who would win? The entire demonic army of hell or one guy who liked his pet?
[2:34:45] <+seduwu> Could the Khan Makyr even resurrect daisy?
[2:34:47] <raikagelord1> New Wolfeinstien confirmed Alternate universe.
[2:34:49] <mdkcde> did I miss the Samur Maykr scene?
[2:34:49] <+RowenCleric> What if its a rabbit with a jetpack
[2:34:52] <%Neoepochx> It is the power of the Isekai
[2:34:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Argent D’Lore
[2:34:59] <venomfury86> remember when Pat got to this part?
[2:35:00] <%Pillagius> There's an amusing lewd comic of how Samuel Hayden reconstructed Daisy from the rabbit foot Doomslayer has with him into a rabbit girl
[2:35:05] <%Neoepochx> Seeping into Doom now. We will never be free.
[2:35:05] <RichochetForce> @mdkcde No.

[2:35:57] <%lewdskeletor13> Argent breebuPog
[2:35:58] <stratunes> @seduwu this is technically an alternate universe. Maybe daisy already exists?
[2:36:00] <Shardlab> They did the same thing Sam did
[2:36:03] <mark_collins45> Daisy is the true source of Argent Energy
[2:36:06] <gunsrlove> hell energy...not argent just yet
[2:36:10] <venomfury86> traitor assholes
[2:36:11] <+CaptainJax> Slap that helljuice in there what could go wrong
[2:36:15] <%thesyndrome> @BallerSwagBro9k same
[2:36:18] <derap41> Ah yes close the warpgate
[2:36:26] <%DesertPenguin> No longer quote on quote anymore. It's real baby
[2:36:36] <stratunes> he said it
[2:36:38] <dinnydanny777> Who knew that God was a bitch
[2:36:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Heaven wants to mine Hell for energy
[2:36:41] <%DesertPenguin> quote on quote or quote unquote?
[2:36:44] <+evbites> Heaven is just demons that are passive agressive
[2:36:54] <Pnutz409> but... God tho.
[2:36:55] <penitentpentwitch> "Balance" meaning "Stop Losing to Hell"
[2:37:00] <duskrush> Everybody always fuckin up tryna end the energy crisis
[2:37:04] <dinnydanny777> God probably just acts like a Karen
[2:37:11] <mark_collins45> Argent Energy is PEOPLE!
[2:37:20] <+JingKaisean> Karen Maykr
[2:37:23] <%lewdskeletor13> SOYLENT GREEN
[2:37:26] <+CaptainJax> The theme of this series is DONT FUCK WITH HELLJUICE
[2:37:27] <%emperordread> It's made out of people
[2:37:35] <+seduwu> Argent Energy is ALIVE!!!
[2:37:38] <stratunes> even tho they aliens, it's awesome that the maykr are basicly this universes "heaven"
[2:37:42] <%Neoepochx> There is an explanation why Urdak and Hell have never actually interacted until Doomguy showed up.
[2:37:55] <+santafer> Peaceful ways
[2:37:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Peaceful Kappa
[2:37:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LETS USE REAPER TECHNOLOGY WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRON SHEPARD?
[2:38:03] <venomfury86> Well, we know who is the god in this Doom universe
[2:38:04] <RichochetForce> @stratunes Yup, straight up space alien angels.
[2:38:11] <%dekkitout> "Your new empire?!"
[2:38:16] <%Javaa01> The warp is some cool shit, oh wait who's that, is that Horus over there?

[2:38:26] <%lewdskeletor13> I peepeepoopooed for the sake of the Senrinels
[2:38:27] <brunoberserk> they gonna accept our peaceful ways ... BY FORCE
[2:38:34] <+evbites> Doomguy's whole motivation"you don't know what your messin with!!"
[2:38:38] <%Neoepochx> @stratunes Urdak can actually be translated as "Roof" in Hebrew, so that is interesting.
[2:38:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[2:38:39] <RichochetForce> @brunoberserk Exactly. A crusading PEACEFUL force.
[2:38:41] <+seduwu> It’s People Energy
[2:38:42] <Shardlab> The energy created from the suffering od undying souls
[2:38:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the demons only had hell energy, argent was what they made with the hell energy
[2:38:44] <valriot> He did it for the poopoo of peepee
[2:38:45] <+Afterman_> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:38:46] <Ozmodyas> I only poopoo farted for the good of Argent Dnur
[2:38:47] <+CryptusMaximus> Wonder where Sam learned that
[2:38:47] <+CaptainJax> Using hell we have developed 7G
[2:38:48] <venomfury86> yes
[2:38:55] <Pnutz409> aliens
[2:38:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> wait demons speak arabic?
[2:39:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @CaptainJax NO 666G
[2:39:04] <%sonofthedeepsouth> th fuck
[2:39:22] <duskrush> It's straight up biblical hell, yeah
[2:39:22] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @spidervenomized
[2:39:25] <%Neoepochx> Makyr tech is pretty techy
[2:39:25] <+nintega010> man I cant wait until they get to end game lore. their shock will be fun to see
[2:39:25] <valriot> They found the Shungite Stones
[2:39:27] <+garbocardboardington> Tech deck?
[2:39:27] <Shardlab> What's it say if it's Arabic script>
[2:39:28] <+evbites> @sonofthedeepsouth Demons speak everything
[2:39:28] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re like Christianized Nords
[2:39:28] <DedlokPM> Doomguy: "It's Hell Energy! It's bad! You are not supposed to use it! STOPPP!" Samuel: "Ha ha. Argent Energy Machine go BRRRRRRR!" doodDerp
[2:39:29] <%DesertPenguin> Galactic Hell
[2:39:29] <Shardlab> ?
[2:39:30] <ralphfromdk> Hell is not bible hell. They are just aliens from another dimension
[2:39:31] <stratunes> @Neoepochx wooow I beat this game twice and never even thought to translate urdak. Thanks man!
[2:39:33] <derap41> Its not but there may have been some cross contamination
[2:39:34] <%Javaa01> It's 50/50 between biblical and fantasy hell
[2:39:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HELLHAUS?
[2:39:39] <venomfury86> Moobot is angry
[2:39:41] <Nested_Dreams> Fun note - Maykers have a way of dying
[2:39:41] <ghostspartan80> its a mix
[2:39:44] <dinnydanny777> It's deliberately vague?
[2:39:47] <laguerrilha> Yeah, dimension, not religious plane
[2:39:49] <duskrush> the distinction between this hell and biblical hell is neglicgible
[2:39:52] <penitentpentwitch> It's Dimensional Hell with Time Shenanigans rolled into it.
[2:39:52] <+seduwu> hell dimension
[2:39:55] <derap41> Our hell may have been inspired by their hell
[2:39:55] <brachydios777> Netherrealm
[2:39:59] <%DesertPenguin> The fact that Hell is a physical place in the universe somewhere is fucking awesome
[2:40:01] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Meme Hell
[2:40:04] <%Neoepochx> Hell is also a mirror/singularity to all other dimenisions.
[2:40:08] <+seduwu> Melee Hell
[2:40:10] <duskrush> choke jerk hell
[2:40:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @penitentpentwitch The flow of time is convoluted in Hell
[2:40:15] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Hell is 9gag
[2:40:16] <BlackermanZX> Its pretty much "not" hell but actually its hell LUL
[2:40:19] <%lewdskeletor13> Lore for days
[2:40:21] <%Neoepochx> There exists only 1 hell, but all other dimensions are connected to it.
[2:40:22] <sniffy77> From what I've heard there's a bunch of different dimensions, like this Earth isn't the Earth from the early doom games, but hell is this omnidimension that can invade anywhere.
[2:40:27] <+seduwu> There is only Choke Jetk Heaven
[2:40:30] <%thesyndrome> it seems like the hell dimension has access to ALL others, while being immune to penetration by advanced races like the makyrs, so hell does seem unique in this regard
[2:40:31] <+seduwu> jerk
[2:40:38] <%DesertPenguin> @sniffy77 like Wolverine through the X-men movies?
[2:40:44] <+garbocardboardington> Uh oh, desire bad tho
[2:40:47] <RichochetForce> Yes, Hell is repeatedly called a Timeless Realm.
[2:40:48] <%sonofthedeepsouth> immune to penetrations hey
[2:40:58] <+trippersigs22> Just got here. what we talking about?
[2:41:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thesyndrome It is the key to the multiverse, because evil and suffering are omnipresent
[2:41:07] <%Javaa01> Yes, the kings answer to the Khan Makyr
[2:41:07] <%thesyndrome> @trippersigs22 hell lore
[2:41:08] <derap41> Khan makes aka King maker
[2:41:08] <duskrush> I think it's one of those things where our hell is inspired by their hell
[2:41:10] <%lewdskeletor13> So that’s why all them ghosts were in Hell
[2:41:11] <%Neoepochx> Yeah, Hell transcends time and space
[2:41:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @trippersigs22 woolieLORE woolieLORE

[2:46:07] <spidervenomized> the betrayer in the background
[2:46:08] <duskrush> What if there was a haunted house based on Doom where instead of demons jumping out and scaring you, the theme is that YOU'RE the demons and the Doom Slayer is chasing you through the maze
[2:46:09] <derap41> Shoulder guns too

[2:46:57] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Welcome to the Loratorium
[2:46:58] <%DesertPenguin> Exactly
[2:47:00] <peachy996> What if Doom but instead of Demons it was lore instead
[2:47:06] <%sonofthedeepsouth> a suprise but a welcomed one
[2:47:07] <penitentpentwitch> That solid 'corruption bar'
[2:47:20] <%Asuterisuku> The high FOV looks weird when it's not taking up my full monitor.
[2:47:21] <%lewdskeletor13> A welcome one to be sure
[2:47:23] <heart_ablaze> @woolieversus don't read the last lore page in this level, it has spil
[2:47:26] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Fuck you bitch
[2:47:30] <23lolman23> Can't belive people complain about this lorestuff
[2:47:31] <heart_ablaze> * spoilers
[2:47:31] <derap41> Hmm
[2:47:32] <RogueMinja> Pity this shotgun in your face.
[2:47:32] <duskrush> Look man we NEED to solve the energy crisis
[2:47:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I don't care
[2:47:35] <mark_collins45> For the greater good
[2:47:35] <akman14> The Argent must flow
[2:47:37] <Yummy_Nukes> just because the story ought to be secondary doesn't mean it can't be awesome
[2:47:38] <%DesertPenguin> It's a cool feeling when you realize, this is just gonna be all lore and then you realize that means how much information you're getting in a game universe that's been vague forever.
[2:47:39] <+evbites> Shut up buggy

[3:17:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Nomad94 You can turn it off
[3:17:10] <@Solidus_113> THE DROP
[3:17:10] <laguerrilha> dash
[3:17:15] <a_mad_dragon> if he closes his eyes, you're fucked SoonerLater
[3:17:19] <%Neoepochx> Tutorials can be turned off, but they were really trying to idiot proof the game.
[3:17:19] <@Solidus_113> THROAT SINGING
[3:17:21] <RogueMinja> Chaingun this shit.
[3:17:23] <DeeVee_TV> shotgun from across the arena
[3:17:24] <peachy996> @Nomad94 Yeah I turned off tips
[3:17:24] <$legacy0117> You can always turn off tool tips, but yeah.
[3:17:26] <%Gruhunchously> Oh dear, now you have angered him
[3:17:29] <%eggypigeon> Imagine your shield being hyped about being killed by your oponnent
[3:17:29] <%kapcommunist> i like they give you his tells. like, this shit is hard enough even when knowing
[3:17:30] <Nomad94> @BallerSwagBro9k I guess
[3:17:31] <burstangel15> He style switched from royalguard to swordmaster
[3:17:33] <stratunes> best part of the track homies
[3:17:36] <%DesertPenguin> Grenades stagger which gives you time to do damage
[3:17:39] <laguerrilha> Need to dash to evade, they will trck other wise
[3:17:40] <venomfury86> you don't need to time it
[3:17:49] <%DesertPenguin> use a different fun jesus
[3:17:52] <%DesertPenguin> gun*
[3:17:52] <%Gruhunchously> nice
[3:17:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> KAR. EN. TUK.
[3:18:08] <Tucker0603> use chaingun shield?
[3:18:10] <peachy996> This part is reminiscent of the Cyberdemon energy waves in 2016
[3:18:11] <%DesertPenguin> This would be a good use for the shield
[3:18:14] <%DesertPenguin> shield
[3:18:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> Did...did Woolie just counter tackle him?
[3:18:24] <%Camail> the gitting gud intensifies
[3:18:24] <%Asuterisuku> Chaingun shield is SO good for that move.
[3:18:33] <%Gamefriendly> does woolie not like to use the rocket launcher
[3:18:34] <%DesertPenguin> V A R I E T Y
[3:18:34] <peachy996> I love when the chants do this

[3:18:55] <cochramd1992> BFG
[3:18:56] <+evbites> bfg
[3:18:56] <@Solidus_113> you have so much ammo
[3:19:01] <Tucker0603> plasma has ammo
[3:19:03] <%TheREALGirthMan> Weapon variety isn't incredibly important on the lower difficulty even with the way the combat loop works
[3:19:05] <venomfury86> KAR EN TUK
[3:19:07] <Nested_Dreams> BFG is FED
[3:19:12] <%eggypigeon> KAR EN TUK
[3:19:13] <%Asuterisuku> Too early, Woolie.
[3:19:13] <$legacy0117> BFG
[3:19:14] <%thesyndrome> use plasma
[3:19:16] <venomfury86> Plasma
[3:19:17] <%DesertPenguin> Good thing you have the extra lives
[3:19:18] <spidervenomized> Early
[3:19:18] <cochramd1992> learn how to use more than one weapon
[3:19:19] <$legacy0117> DO IT
[3:19:21] <laguerrilha> use other gunsa
[3:19:21] <%DesertPenguin> You need to just use different guns
[3:19:24] <%TheREALGirthMan> It's essential on nightmare for sure but hurt me plenty is generous enough that he doesn't really need to switch to progress
[3:19:27] <%DesertPenguin> you're not thinking with all of your options
[3:19:27] <+kewlmyc> good thing you have a shit ton of lives then
[3:19:28] <duskrush> Alllll the lives
[3:19:30] <SuperChumps> luckily you're playing on baby mode
[3:19:32] <%Konquerer> not quite as intense when you have 5 extra chances
[3:19:34] <%mitchteck> Bfg
[3:19:34] <%Gruhunchously> It seems a n odd decision for this game to use a life system like this
[3:19:35] <%thesyndrome> use a rapid fire weapon, use plasma
[3:19:36] <%Neoepochx> He's shooting too early
[3:19:37] <mark_collins45> Arbalest!
[3:19:37] <derap41> Sinewave?
[3:19:37] <VJdarkworld> MID OR BFG
[3:19:38] <%Javaa01> Sine Wave
[3:19:38] <peachy996> The Slowdown rune is good for this
[3:19:39] <a_mad_dragon> sinusoidal is correct
[3:19:45] <cochramd1992> Woolie, use the BFG
[3:19:47] <daemonazaezal> correct word
[3:19:48] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[3:19:50] <duskrush> Quick, do Trigonometry
[3:19:58] <cochramd1992> did you forget the BFG exists?
[3:19:58] <%DesertPenguin> Chaingun Shield, Rocket Launcher, C'mon
[3:19:58] <duskrush> It's the only way to dodge
[3:20:00] <SuperChumps> don't use BFG
[3:20:05] <$legacy0117> BRG REGGIE. TELL HIM!
[3:20:07] <laguerrilha> Yeah withouth the 7up he would have needed to go a few times against him
[3:20:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That ballista attacment is for aoe crownd control. You need to switch to the other for single damage @WoolieVersus
[3:20:07] <a_mad_dragon> approach at a tangent Kappa
[3:20:10] <BlackermanZX> Gotta hit him while hes green right
[3:20:10] <%Asuterisuku> This phase always kills me at least once.

[3:21:43] <peachy996> Perfect place to stop
[3:21:46] <burstangel15> Doomguy cant ride with the bois no more.
[3:21:46] <+adamthreetimes> this game rules so hard

[3:21:54] <+TheNeonGraveyard> "Actually the slayer is kinda problematic :/"
[3:21:54] <mark_collins45> He could have just teleported the Hell Priest back to the fortress and killed him there. Just saying.
[3:21:58] <venomfury86> KEEP THE COOKIE
[3:21:58] <RichochetForce> @Gruhunchously I suspect that might happen
[3:22:01] <laguerrilha> yeah this is a good place to stop

[3:22:16] <%Javaa01> Yeah, go to the hub and call the session there
[3:22:16] <%Asuterisuku> I'm so sad that I missed Mars Core.
[3:22:17] <halfmasks> good place to stop rn
[3:22:20] <$legacy0117> Yeah, if they found all the lore, they should know the original Night Sentinels under his command are gone.

[3:29:57] <Ozmodyas> The lighting matches the in game version
[3:29:57] <+brainoneohone> hoes no longer mad??
[3:29:58] <laguerrilha> Lots of stuff happened on today recording
[3:30:00] <penitentpentwitch> And now the Fortress of Doom matches your back lighting!
[3:30:13] <%Asuterisuku> The next mission is a long one, this is a good place to stop.
[3:30:13] <peachy996> Sometimes Chat must remind you
[3:30:14] <venomfury86> it was confirmed that Doomguy didn't use a mech to kill the titan
[3:30:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:30:19] <+seduwu> someone should tell woolie that the ps5 event was delayed
[3:30:34] <Xxstevo69xX > it's fine Woolz. imma watch what I missed once the stream is over
[3:30:36] <@Solidus_113> but you were wrong this time, and that's what matters
[3:30:37] <+TheBigTaco> I mean the chat tells you good places to stop, but you don't
[3:30:49] <%DesertPenguin> We are here to guide you
[3:30:52] <laguerrilha> @WoolieVersus now you can replay those fights so you can train
[3:30:57] <peachy996> You were wrong here, We were wrong last session
[3:31:05] <penitentpentwitch> Such is the true tragedy of Doom Eternal, long sessions with weird stopping points. The only natural ones are in the Fortress and those can be hours apart.

[3:36:19] <TheoTTree> Sasuke is a really well written character up until the Kage Summit @WoolieVersus
[3:36:20] <stratunes> good stream woolie, you are ripping well.
[3:36:28] <+brainoneohone> hot people can do nothing wrong
[3:36:29] <stratunes> and tearing
[3:36:29] <dinnydanny777> Carol Baskins did nothing wrong
[3:36:31] <burstangel15> #Tobiramadidnothingwrong
[3:36:44] <+aishman> @DesertPenguin Sorry dude, I literally got a blaring alarm on my phone about my place going under curfew, it's all in my mind at the moment.
[3:36:44] <emeraldskrull> dragon prince is ass lmao
[3:36:45] <BlackermanZX> Might as well say Zamasu was right and Griffith did nothing wrong too doodRage
[3:36:48] <mishkabunansa> Ive never heard LAB, that's a new one for me.
[3:36:50] <TheoTTree> LAB isn't real, never heard that one
[3:36:51] <venomfury86> BACK IN?
[3:36:51] <%Camail> i have never seen LAB
[3:36:53] <+brainoneohone> Carol Baskin is not hot, therefore wrong
[3:36:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> who the fuck says LAB
[3:36:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He tried to kill Sakura AND THEN LATER hit her with tsukuyomi so she'd thin he killed her.
[3:36:59] <burstangel15> Zuko gets more development in one season than Sasuke does in the entire series.
[3:37:00] <Them00n> Dragon Prince is good. Better than Korra but not as good as ATLA
[3:37:03] <+seduwu> ATLA is the only way
[3:37:07] <derap41> Oh I've seen that Rule 34
[3:37:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Scientists Kappa
[3:37:15] <%gatorafan> I forgot people used to refer to the main characters as the Gaang, that was great.
[3:37:21] <%tearfuldevil> @CanadianAnimatorGuy okay sasuke's badly written but he's a (child) soldier who deserted, he killed some rando samurai, and planned to maybe kill some more, he's got nothing on Griffith
[3:37:21] <%Shishi1205> That one was sick
[3:37:26] <%DesertPenguin> cool
[3:37:27] <kirbyofdark> ohh
[3:37:28] <%Shishi1205> Great woolie bait there
[3:37:35] <%DesertPenguin> If only they could fix the JoJo Stand dub names
[3:37:38] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I just got super into Dorohedoro
[3:37:41] <venomfury86> well, by killing the one you love, you can also get the Mangekyo
[3:37:42] <$legacy0117> Thank you for playing guys. Glad you got to see the Doomguy ffg flashbacks. Those are really the most important Lore bits, as they connect everything together.

[3:38:22] <@Solidus_113> Which is why everyone expected All Star for Part 4
[3:38:23] <%tearfuldevil> @KaiserMario so its a step in quality up over Korra then Kappa
[3:38:24] <burstangel15> Other anime getting licenced music is also a Jojo reference.
[3:38:31] <+Calern> radiohead

[3:42:07] <%Binary_Fireball> but man
[3:42:10] <+JingKaisean> they should get compared to a fuckin dingleberry
[3:42:21] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but they sing about existential dread
[3:42:27] <+Creggamonsta> Muse is super underated
[3:42:28] <%Irridium> I think Axl Rose is also an asshole
[3:42:34] <+Creggamonsta> been making good music for years
[3:42:38] <%Asuterisuku> Muse is hit and miss for me.
[3:42:43] <+JingKaisean> oh so they sing about sad times while millions of people cheer them on? what a bunch of pussies
[3:42:49] <+Creggamonsta> they got some songs that slaps
[3:42:51] <+BubbaRands> Axl Rose is a huge asshole. Sting is cool tho
[3:43:04] <%Asuterisuku> They have some good shit, but a lot of what they put out is boring, pretentious, or both.
[3:43:05] <theppl> I heard Axel Rose is a dick
[3:43:17] <theppl> Didn't one of the members of Alice in Chains die?
[3:43:25] <peachy996> Layne Staley died yeah
[3:43:28] <dinnydanny777> Butterflies and Hurricanes is a great song
[3:43:31] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Like a robot lol
[3:43:33] <%Binary_Fireball> hahahaha
[3:43:35] <peachy996> They got a guy to replace him eventually
[3:43:49] <peachy996> New Alice In Chains ain't bad
[3:43:49] <Hammatime8> Bro how do you get free fireworks for your show and be upset about it?
[3:43:50] <%Asuterisuku> @theppl Layne Staley passed away of a drug overdose in the mid nineties. It wasn't until 2009 that they started to play seriously again.
[3:43:52] <penitentpentwitch> How dare you pay me!?
[3:44:04] <%Chatterbox1991> @theppl he's calmed down significantly since the 80s
[3:44:13] <%Asuterisuku> Black Gives Way to Blue was amazing, by the way.
[3:44:14] <%Binary_Fireball> that sucks
[3:44:21] <theppl> Fucking brutal
[3:44:25] <peachy996> Yeah Black Gives Way to Blue was good
[3:44:33] <peachy996> The Album after all wasn't bad either
[3:44:34] <dinnydanny777> I can't be offended by anything Radiohead do because the whole act strikes me as being about depressing shit
[3:44:34] <RichochetForce> Oh fuck Mos Def
[3:44:34] <venomfury86> feelsbad
[3:44:36] <laguerrilha> Axl was such an asshole
[3:44:42] <RichochetForce> Mos Def lost his goddamn mind after a certain point
[3:44:42] <peachy996> Oh is this the birthday story?
[3:44:52] <%Asuterisuku> The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here is one of my all time favourite albums, too.
[3:44:59] <dinnydanny777> I mean, within reason, obviously, but I expect Thom Yorke to be mopey
[3:45:01] <a_mad_dragon> MATISYAHU?
[3:45:08] <%Asuterisuku> But it's... _Grunge-y ass grunge._
[3:45:08] <RichochetForce> It's probably Matisyahu
[3:45:13] <+Creggamonsta> yeah
[3:45:19] <%Nekros4442> 1:30? holy shit
[3:45:20] <Tha_Mik> damn

[3:46:30] <%arcielardor> cheer500 Hey Woolie, I mentioned Record of Ragnarok a but back but didn't mention why it's awesome. 13 gods vs 13 humans in a battle to decide if humans get to live or not. It's got stuff like The Bible's Adam in a Jojo-stle fist fight with Zeus and Hercules vs Jack the Ripper where Jack is basically serial killer Batman.

[3:48:50] <%jiggy_snipe> probably
[3:48:52] <+JingKaisean> honestly man
[3:48:55] <RichochetForce> Died early as FUCK
[3:48:57] <peachy996> Oh Kurt would be one bitter motherfucker
[3:49:01] <derap41> Probably
[3:49:05] <+Creggamonsta> soundcloud rappers
[3:49:05] <RichochetForce> Origa died at 40 from throat cancer.
[3:49:10] <RichochetForce> She'd probably still be singing

[3:49:20] <@Solidus_113> Modern day George Carlin would have the most fucking material if he was still around for the last decade
[3:49:20] <%Asuterisuku> He was depressed _then._ Kurt would've probably left the US ages ago.
[3:49:20] <%Ecchigun> Ecchigun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! whens dokapon
[3:49:23] <redrins> depends, is this the timeline where sugeknight doesnt exist
[3:49:24] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus like Public Enemy saying no to Tony Hawk because Copyright?
[3:49:25] <townzzzzz> biggie becomes slim
[3:49:26] <+BubbaRands> Nujabes would rule Lo-fi jams to chill/study to
[3:49:26] <derap41> Bet Biggie would be thin too
[3:49:28] <laguerrilha> Nujabes didnt even got a chance to grow to his best
[3:49:31] <theppl> Is The Birthday Massicre still broken up?
[3:49:39] <mark_collins45> Patrice
[3:49:43] <dinnydanny777> Yep, Jimi Hendrix's career as a huge artist lasted for about one or two years as well but he had problems
[3:49:46] <%jiggy_snipe> I think J Dilla and Nujabes would be thriving
[3:49:47] <RichochetForce> @mark_collins45 OOf
[3:49:48] <mishkabunansa> I felt that way a lot with XXXTENTACION. The guy was changing his life around, doing good in the community, had a more positive outlook, then boom.
[3:49:58] <RichochetForce> Patrice would have some JOKES about modern day stuff
[3:50:02] <RichochetForce> Same with Bernie Hill
[3:50:03] <laguerrilha> oof

[3:50:21] <peachy996> And Michael Clark Duncan
[3:50:28] <RichochetForce> @peachy996 RIP Bernie
[3:50:39] <RichochetForce> I STILL can't believe Michael Clark Duncan is dead
[3:50:44] <mark_collins45> With all the shit that is going on I would have loved to hear what Patrice would be saying right now.
[3:50:46] <RichochetForce> That shit stings
[3:50:55] <laguerrilha> Thank god for anesthesia
[3:51:01] <notgarza> Im dying with them
[3:51:03] <kirbyofdark> too much money
[3:51:08] <derap41> Get some extras
[3:51:08] <theppl> Dentists are thieves at this point
[3:51:25] <+JingKaisean> dude, getting an MRI in the US is a giant scam
[3:51:33] <%Shishi1205> One I have is a bit tilted
[3:51:39] <pede2011> It's not bad, I got all 4 removed the same session, it was a breeze
[3:51:40] <+JingKaisean> every insurance company makes you get an xray and waste your time
[3:51:45] <a_mad_dragon> i have a wisdom tooth that is completely sideways but it's not doing anything
[3:51:46] <dinnydanny777> You gotta get the nice dentists tho
[3:51:49] <%Konquerer> when are we gonna start implanting shark teeth
[3:51:49] <+JingKaisean> before you can get the thing that you actually need to figure out what's wrong with you
[3:51:51] <%Shishi1205> That sounds expensive as shit
[3:51:58] <+krabsan> !uptime
[3:52:00] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 52 minutes
[3:52:00] <pede2011> also it was 100 bucks, third world prices boy
[3:52:02] <laguerrilha> Imagine doing that without anesthesia
[3:52:02] <%Shishi1205> Here its far more afordable
[3:52:08] <mdkcde> 800$?
[3:52:16] <Digiimp> I had to get 2 wisdom teeth out. one had to be carved out.
[3:52:17] <VJdarkworld> these wisdom teeth dont sound like they give us wisdom #MakesUthink
[3:52:19] <derap41> Had two teeth ripped from my lower jaw because my back teeth would grow forward they never did and now I have two gaps in the back of my mouth
[3:52:31] <+rytyoung> L3 click for dashing ftw
[3:52:33] <+slimmixrp> L3
[3:52:43] <RichochetForce> Eww
[3:52:45] <RichochetForce> That would feel bad
[3:52:46] <%Javaa01> L3 dashing is wack
[3:52:47] <+Creggamonsta> had 3 wisdom out. i was down for like 2 weeks
[3:52:52] <$legacy0117> Dentists in cities are ruthless. Dentists in the country, at least in America, are willing to extract teeth for $160. They're good people.
[3:53:00] <%Javaa01> L3 grenade swap is what the game director runs
[3:53:05] <@Solidus_113> think of it like a bayo dodge, or trickster dash
[3:53:22] <RichochetForce> See? That would feel bad
[3:53:33] <Jolnir> nonce
[3:53:36] <BlackermanZX> Dash L3 is wack
[3:53:38] <%mitchteck> Ok fair enough
[3:53:52] <dinnydanny777> No do bumper jumper
[3:53:58] <BoneBagMel> On mouse, i Dash is spammable I usually bind dashes to mouse wheel
[3:54:00] <VJdarkworld> get the back button attachment 👀
[3:54:06] <%Javaa01> The D-Pad nade swap is a bad bind
[3:54:14] <laguerrilha> Because now with double grenade it does a LOT of dmg plus aoe
[3:54:16] <%Javaa01> Straight up awful
[3:54:30] <peachy996> basically git gud
[3:54:41] <%kyh9> Luck is a skill
[3:54:41] <+I_of_the_Storm> If you let off L2 during hook you drop time slow too and can fast zip with meathook
[3:54:53] <%Javaa01> Even on the PC version there are some wack default binds, most people who go hard rebind their entire control scheme for the most part
[3:54:54] <derap41> How the fuck is the market still up
[3:55:08] <+ChrisAlgoo> yo love this bisexual lighting
[3:55:14] <%kyh9> Maybe Get Into Fighting Games with Power Rangers?
