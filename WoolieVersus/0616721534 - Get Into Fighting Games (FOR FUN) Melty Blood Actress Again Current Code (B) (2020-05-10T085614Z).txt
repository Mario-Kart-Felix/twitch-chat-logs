[0:08:36] <AMWACloak> It's like going in to fight kobolds and a dragon steps out.
[0:08:39] <%phatmac16> Two Mystic Eye users can't exist in the same match
[0:08:40] <%Jetzord> I was just playing a game with him
[0:08:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> i will continue to be the shit and ask "when the real neco's comming?"
[0:08:45] <%ChoculaUltra> I never got Shiki to NP5 in FGO and this is just reminding me of my failure monkaS
[0:08:48] <%tearfuldevil> im here

[0:09:22] <lonegargoyle> Ryougi is Rekka
[0:09:22] <%FenixSeraph> she can throw her knife
[0:09:24] <%Wool> Alps taught me how to play and now I'm gonna look like garbage if I get a match in lmao
[0:09:26] <+hardwiredfire> F-Ryougi is sick and she has counters!
[0:09:28] <+Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus rekkas, 22a throws a knife
[0:09:30] <%phatmac16> Rekka
[0:09:30] <MasterIcarus7> knife throw airdash momentum mixups
[0:09:32] <ChuuniGarbage> @WoolieVersus she got REAL good normals and rekkas
[0:09:33] <%tearfuldevil> i should be good
[0:09:33] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Rekka and mad air control
[0:09:34] <Fiendmaw> You need to show Ryougii's Last Arc
[0:09:40] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> She's the air goddess
[0:09:41] <%alephalpha> she's the coolest
[0:09:41] <+hardwiredfire> H-Ryougi has knife loops. Sick knife loops too
[0:09:42] <Fighter_Zeta> Ryougi has a parry on reverse dp
[0:09:42] <DrBeanie> always wanted to get good at melty
[0:09:50] <Tyth3sly> same
[0:09:54] <%alephalpha> to be fair the real master of the air is f-hime
[0:09:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> No one can outfight an airborne ryougi
[0:09:57] <%phatmac16> show Ryougi's Last Arc
[0:09:59] <sendart> she can kill riders real good
[0:10:07] <paizurihokage> VoHiYo
[0:10:08] <%ondri21> @ANGRA_MAlNYU hime says hi
[0:10:13] <%FenixSeraph> toilet tech
[0:10:16] <ChuuniGarbage> melty netplay is the good shit
[0:10:18] <$miscinsanity> always bet on melty blood PJSalt
[0:10:26] <+solzan2000> \o/
[0:10:30] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Ryougi is so much cooler than just "knife girl." More accurate to call her Deadshot Mom.
[0:10:31] <+TheBesteban> RELOAD
[0:10:36] <Xxenase> knife wife PogChamp
[0:10:37] <misterpans> YES
[0:10:38] <+BurkeBigsby> Is this game competing with Under night for most outrageous, nonsensical names?
[0:10:39] <%tearfuldevil> its my second game ever
[0:10:42] <%phatmac16> BEST GIRL TIME
[0:10:45] <gordieda20> GUN
[0:10:47] <%paladinstarbuster> TOHOU
[0:10:48] <%TUMZtwitch> YO MELTY BLOOD?!
[0:10:54] <Greenjim> best girl? that's not hisui up there

[0:11:01] <%Jetzord> Tearknack is 1-0 you est be careful
[0:11:03] <%TUMZtwitch> MELTY BLOOD!!!
[0:11:07] <%DreyfussFrost> @BurkeBigsby Not really competing, same developer.
[0:11:07] <Tyth3sly> no knife no hope
[0:11:08] <+hardwiredfire> Knife Wife here to cut everything on an existential level
[0:11:12] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Black Barrel time
[0:11:16] <+ratearth> Best girl??? Neither of them are playing Neco-arc
[0:11:17] <MasterIcarus7> he should've picked fsion if he wanted to shot
[0:11:18] <%atwitchical> @BurkeBigsby I think Sion is in both games.
[0:11:19] <%alephalpha> knife mom
[0:11:20] <+hardwiredfire> Counter on reverse DP
[0:11:21] <SableS139a> For Sion's QCF, she wields a G U N
[0:11:24] <Greenjim> f-roog's launch is 236b236b236b or something like that
[0:11:31] <%Solidnick18> power of gun
[0:11:38] <gonomax> knoife vs g u n
[0:11:38] <%DreyfussFrost> @BurkeBigsby Under Night is just unlicensed Melty Blood.
[0:11:50] <Greenjim> uh oh
[0:11:52] <+RyTYoung> Go Woolie goooo
[0:11:53] <%phatmac16> SHE WEILDS THE BLACK BARRELL
[0:11:54] <ChuuniGarbage> @DreyfussFrost it's not tho, it's WAY more grounded
[0:11:54] <Tyth3sly> Under Night doesn't play like Melty at all though
[0:11:55] <ManOfReason> HOLY that push back
[0:11:57] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> f
[0:11:59] <%ChoculaUltra> the power of GUN
[0:12:04] <%TUMZtwitch> MELTY BLOOD SON
[0:12:06] <%phatmac16> All in my calcultions
[0:12:09] <DedlokPM> rooGun
[0:12:11] <MasterIcarus7> UNIB is inspired by Melty from an aesthetic standpoint
[0:12:19] <+RyTYoung> BRAP
[0:12:22] <%phatmac16> Let him show the last arc drive
[0:12:22] <%DreyfussFrost> Sure but close enough.
[0:12:27] <Thunderhog> For the record, H-Shiki auto grabs the knife without a grab animation
[0:12:34] <SableS139a> SKU-DI-DI-PAP-PAP-PAP
[0:12:41] <DDDorsett> Ban All Shikis Kappa
[0:12:43] <Thunderhog> And can grab that shit mid air
[0:12:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> The most powerful move in anime. Gun.
[0:12:58] <ChuuniGarbage> h-ryougi knife loops are the real shit
[0:13:05] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Always try to finish air combos with grabs
[0:13:10] <+cha0tic_klutch> Hey whats happening everybody
[0:13:10] <NotDamare> someone call n2l
[0:13:10] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> wish Ryougi
[0:13:11] <%phatmac16> YEYEYEYE
[0:13:12] <+RyTYoung> She has a whip too, she's a modern day Belmont, with GUN
[0:13:14] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @ondri21
[0:13:17] <OkamiDude15> woolie's learning evo19MindBlown
[0:13:17] <Tyth3sly> n2w
[0:13:18] <Greenjim> oh wait, I think it's 236a236a236b
[0:13:23] <Greenjim> f-roog's launcher
[0:13:23] <%FenixSeraph> play on Shiki's stage, the track for it is awesome and a remix of her anime theme
[0:13:31] <Greenjim> which shiki???
[0:13:31] <%chiluzza> turn around?
[0:13:37] <OkamiDude15> shiki's theme is great
[0:13:39] <Greenjim> tohno? nanaya? roog??
[0:13:40] <SableS139a> @FenixSeraph We talkin' Tohno?
[0:13:45] <gonomax> shiki's theme is the best
[0:13:46] <%FenixSeraph> Yuki Kajiura is based
[0:13:46] <LibriJamm> R. Shiki Hold 5C for unblockables.
[0:13:46] <+esedu> you can only do that launcher if you don't sweep
[0:13:47] <+Chronoreyer> @FenixSeraph that stage is disabled on netplay iirc, it lags
[0:13:52] <SableS139a> @FenixSeraph Oh, you meant Ryougi.
[0:13:53] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ryougi shiki will serve you well, no matter if it's in melty or in fgo, she gets the work done
[0:13:58] <crimsonsaens> I thought Ryougi's air grab was different, is that a moon thing?
[0:13:59] <%phatmac16> YEYEYEYE
[0:14:03] <%ondri21> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ damn straight
[0:14:05] <%Solidnick18> nice
[0:14:08] <+RyTYoung> gggg
[0:14:12] <ChuuniGarbage> yeah f-ryougi's so easy to pick up and sooooooooo sick
[0:14:12] <%phatmac16> BASED
[0:14:13] <+hardwiredfire> Knife wife goes hard.
[0:14:14] <+Zoggere> None of the stages are disabled, they have background animaions tuned off
[0:14:16] <Greenjim> it can depend on moon, yes
[0:14:21] <+CJett92> Shiki is so damn cool yo
[0:14:23] <+Zoggere> In community ver
[0:14:25] <Fiendmaw> If you do a raw air throw,you can combo off it. It's called a "gold air throw"
[0:14:28] <Greenjim> h-roog can catch the knife in the air
[0:14:28] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> GG
[0:14:28] <NotDamare> probably thinking of gold throw @crimsonsaens
[0:14:30] <%TUMZtwitch> tumzfestival is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel!
[0:14:31] <%TUMZtwitch> tumzfestival gifted a Tier 1 sub to Alzero83!
[0:14:31] <%TUMZtwitch> tumzfestival gifted a Tier 1 sub to Solidus0101!
[0:14:31] <+RyTYoung> Like me some knife combos
[0:14:33] <%phatmac16> The coolest anime girl
[0:14:34] <+Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus if you cancel a heavy normal into knife pickup its actually frame advantage
[0:14:34] <+theobble> that didn't look like melty that looked like ST
[0:14:38] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus H-shiki can pick the knife up without the animation, and pick it up mid air
[0:14:38] <+hardwiredfire> Her Half moon has loops since it can pick the knife up in mid air.
[0:14:40] <%alephalpha> catching the knife in the air is the real tech
[0:14:44] <Greenjim> the knife is largely for extending blockstrings or for sniping across the screen
[0:14:54] <%Broand> How goes the melty multi
[0:15:07] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[0:15:08] <MasterIcarus7> also f ryougi's charged c normals are unblockable
[0:15:11] <ManOfReason> and i opp-
[0:15:15] <%Solidnick18> just a burp
[0:15:21] <+RyTYoung> I'm a fan of Melty after watching this fisticuffs
[0:15:31] <@Solidus_113> remember when you're matching, pause the stream
[0:15:36] <+Zoggere> If this was delay based the game would be unplayable for 30 seconds after that
[0:15:39] <%Broand> it's gifg though
[0:15:41] <Tyth3sly> man c-sions overhead is so cheap
[0:15:44] <Thunderhog> Melty's some good shit.
[0:15:45] <Axle13j> noice
[0:15:49] <%phatmac16> Melty's the best man
[0:15:52] <%Broand> (pronounced Jiff-g
[0:15:52] <NotDamare> bgs 6b
[0:15:53] <%TUMZtwitch> hands in pockets
[0:16:03] <Thunderhog> Melty's what got me into FGs in the first place
[0:16:05] <hassanico2> This particular BGM gets a bit grating
[0:16:07] <Greenjim> this sion seems pretty new to the game
[0:16:18] <%Jetzord> He is
[0:16:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[0:16:27] <Greenjim> they should at the very least try to combo stuff into 3c into air stuff for more damage
[0:16:31] <%phatmac16> He's getting into fighting games
[0:16:39] <+RyTYoung> @phatmac16 eyyyyy
[0:16:41] <MasterIcarus7> i wish scrawt were here to do the massive sion j.[C] loops
[0:16:48] <Greenjim> kyaa loops
[0:16:50] <%chll0ne> that was fye
[0:16:51] <hassanico2> Woolie seems to have taken to her mechanics pretty well
[0:16:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> whipped
[0:16:57] <NotDamare> he's too busy playing megaman x somewhere
[0:16:59] <Tyth3sly> optimal c-sion combos are really hard
[0:17:02] <Greenjim> this is a game that requires lab time
[0:17:06] <OkamiDude15> we get a neko arc yet?
[0:17:07] <+hardwiredfire> No! No Sion loops!
[0:17:12] <Tyth3sly> depends on the character
[0:17:24] <narcowski> @Greenjim Depends on who you play really. Pretty sure F-Necomech has basically nothing worth labbing
[0:17:30] <Greenjim> lmao
[0:17:30] <+TheBesteban> I've been trying to get the midscreen Miyako bnb down all week. Game def takes a minute
[0:17:34] <+TheBesteban> It's fun though!
[0:17:41] <%TUMZtwitch> LETS GO
[0:17:42] <garrulousAuthority> God I can’t *wait* to tell everyone about fucked up Tsukihime lore
[0:17:42] <+CJett92> Reggie played Neco Arc for a round and had a good laugh
[0:17:45] <Greenjim> there ARE characters that are easier to pick up than others, of course
[0:17:50] <@Solidus_113> gun into gun
[0:17:56] <%TUMZtwitch> NO!
[0:17:57] <%TUMZtwitch> YES
[0:18:00] <%phatmac16> YEYEYE
[0:18:01] <OkamiDude15> wonder green combos

[0:19:03] <crimsonsaens> Last episode of KnK was kind of boring though
[0:19:04] <Greenjim> alternatively you can hold 3 buttons and press down to change buttons
[0:19:05] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @tearknack hey you did your best
[0:19:06] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Shinji's the best
[0:19:10] <%phatmac16> he's there
[0:19:12] <+CJett92> Everyone watch Kara no Kyoukai, it doesnt have any of the Fate memes that everyone makes fun of
[0:19:15] <%TUMZtwitch> @tearknack Well done, sir
[0:19:16] <OkamiDude15> shinji did nothing wrong
[0:19:20] <%alephalpha> boo the man that shinji matou is best anything
[0:19:23] <%tearfuldevil> i jjust wish any of me dps came out
[0:19:24] <OkamiDude15> and by that i mean he did everythin wrong
[0:19:25] <%phatmac16> Shinji is the worst guy
[0:19:29] <garrulousAuthority> Best protagonist is Kaleid Liner Shirou and I’ll stand by that
[0:19:30] <%tearfuldevil> i can never do them in a match
[0:19:36] <+Capn_Trips> KnK is like 10 ish hours I think
[0:19:36] <MasterIcarus7> shinji is the best seaweed
[0:19:41] <ChuuniGarbage> oath under snow is raw
[0:19:43] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Wakame 4lyf
[0:19:44] <+CJett92> @garrulousAuthority I'll stand with you

[0:19:56] <Merkensteiner> Shinji will get waht he deserves
[0:20:02] <Tyth3sly> fwara?
[0:20:05] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> KATO KATO KATO KATO
[0:20:05] <@Solidus_113> Who's Reggie?
[0:20:13] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Wallachia

[0:20:17] <%phatmac16> KATO KATO KATO KATO

[0:20:32] <%phatmac16> TUM'S FESTIVAL
[0:20:33] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> It is Wallachia
[0:20:38] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus So about that knife grab issue, Half moon Ryougi can pick it up without any grab frames and can grab the knife mid air. Literally just a 2 input and it grabs the night
[0:20:39] <+CJett92> It's like a TUMS FESTIVAL
[0:20:39] <OkamiDude15> warachi more like wolbachia
[0:20:40] <Greenjim> walawala
[0:20:40] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> it's a fucked up translation
[0:20:40] <CalderGaming> TUMS FESTIVAL
[0:20:41] <SableS139a> CASTO
[0:20:45] <%FenixSeraph> fuck yeah Wallachia
[0:20:46] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @tearknack that's understandable. we've all been there. that goes away with just playing more i think.

[0:21:22] <+captain_history> @devanmuse the teacher from Higurashi is a Ciel reference
[0:21:24] <misterpans> Higurashi teacher is a reference to ciel
[0:21:37] <SableS139a> With direct permission from Type Moon at that.
[0:21:41] <misterpans> And woolie just played ryougi in mion colors
[0:21:47] <%jiggy_snipe> lol Reggie
[0:21:47] <+TheBesteban> VSAV!?
[0:21:53] <Thunderhog> Real WARAC hours
[0:21:55] <%phatmac16> CUTO
[0:21:56] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> or is he wallachia? i don't even know anymore
[0:22:05] <+Hilleltaco> Kinda reminds me of Jedah too, some of the normals at least
[0:22:09] <%phatmac16> He's Warachia
[0:22:11] <%jiggy_snipe> i think Reggie Wallachia
[0:22:15] <TopTierHarley> Wallachia like Ivan the Terrible
[0:22:15] <Madbearv> where's saber tho
[0:22:18] <Greenjim> it's only automatic for h-moon
[0:22:19] <Tyth3sly> full moon wara has a rising dash like Jedah
[0:22:24] <Thunderhog> You can activate heat at 200
[0:22:26] <%ZombiLoin> shes in smash
[0:22:27] <%ZombiLoin> going to be
[0:22:29] <+hardwiredfire> Half moon is the only auto burst
[0:22:29] <Greenjim> c-moon can activate heat whenever they have more than 100 meter
[0:22:30] <SableS139a> @ANGRA_MAlNYU It's Wallachia in English if I'm correct, but we all call him Wara at this point.
[0:22:38] <ChuuniGarbage> a d a p t
[0:22:49] <Greenjim> f-moon has to be max to go into heat
[0:23:01] <+captain_history> Technically his name is Night of Wallachia
[0:23:04] <garrulousAuthority> It’s Extella on the switch Nero is the Smash candidate
[0:23:06] <Greenjim> c-moon can hit 5abc or 5e to go into heat when they have 100 meter
[0:23:26] <Greenjim> oh, someone found the ciel BnB
[0:23:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:23:38] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus You can activate heat with at least 100 meter, but it will spend all your meter as it ticks down. Heating in Max meter mode gives you Blood heat
[0:23:43] <Tyth3sly> j.b is the real wara button
[0:23:47] <%ZombiLoin> we're getting emiya cooking on the switch so saber is still a candidate
[0:23:48] <Greenjim> found c-ciel's strongest special
[0:23:49] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> f

[0:24:19] <%GuelermeDias> this isn't f-wara
[0:24:23] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The burial agency is fucking scary
[0:24:23] <hassanico2> @niishucks nope

[0:25:52] <ChuuniGarbage> @Jalexster Hime would beg to differ

[0:28:36] <%Wool> Zoggere is an EU boy
[0:28:37] <Thunderhog> Real EU hours
[0:28:37] <Fiendmaw> Rollback is not super solid in this game because it's locked at 4 rollback maximum
[0:28:38] <narcowski> 3.0 or 3.1?
[0:28:41] <Greenjim> melty caster uses rollback
[0:28:42] <MasterIcarus7> yeah this game is rollback

[0:41:10] <AMWACloak> I appreciate that Melty is a small enough community that even the top tier players are around to personally whoop streamers asses.
[0:41:11] <WhiskeyRB> she's never getting a route
[0:41:12] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Satsuki's game play is just dunking you over and over again.

[0:45:01] <Thunderhog> @Drunkengen No one. Reggies on controller as hime
[0:45:02] <narcowski> @hardwiredfire Basically the same as Catsuki but the 2 frame link is a 1 frame link for no reason. She also has an anti-zoning tool that makes her a good Nero counterpick for Satsuki players
[0:45:03] <TalisKanju> ARCHETYPE:EARTH uses wind magic

[0:45:44] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Arctype has a command 22D that gives her a magneto fly
[0:45:45] <+Capn_Trips> The OST is half the reason to watch KnK
[0:45:45] <Mr__Jebus> Big F

[0:49:25] <+hardwiredfire> @optimasmaximas Tsukihime is the Nasuverse light novel that Melty is based on and came before Fate. The Dead Apostles mentioned in Fate are major in Tsukihime. Arcuied is one. I just like the lore more because the Holy Grail Wars are the least interesting thing in the Nasuverse

[0:50:28] <hamsterpossuido> tsukihime is a VN, not a light novel
[0:50:28] <+hardwiredfire> She's a true ancestor, so like, THE vampire queen.
[0:50:32] <garrulousAuthority> Only Nasu gets to fuck up Nasuverse lore
[0:50:32] <inyalga> Twitch is always weird

[1:04:46] <+Chronoreyer> not yet versed in the ways of 30 second blockstrings
[1:04:48] <Thunderhog> So, for those who have not witnessed WAR CRIMES, C-Roa has lightning loops in the corner. Not MVC3 Zero levels, but mother fucker can put you thought a small movie

[1:05:50] <Vashido22> rip
[1:05:52] <inyalga> im hurt
[1:06:02] <OkamiDude15> its just doing its job nkoShrug
[1:06:05] <%phatmac16> What's wrong with Roa's tect boc?
[1:06:08] <narcowski> It's not the lightning loops that make C-Roa top tier, it's the fact that he can just delete crossup protection.
[1:06:09] <%phatmac16> box?
[1:06:16] <inyalga> *Teleports behind bot* nothing personal
[1:06:20] <Vashido22> CASTO
[1:06:22] <inyalga> just doing my job
[1:06:23] <%alephalpha> inklings of warcrimes
[1:06:23] <+Chronoreyer> its not the crossup protection
[1:06:24] <narcowski> Also the 7 frame full screen air unblockable punish that puts you in the corner I guess
[1:06:27] <MasterIcarus7> also roa can cancel specials which is just dumb
[1:06:27] <+Chronoreyer> its the neutral and pressure
[1:06:29] <grenadier42> if you release an anime fighter without sigils, God himself breaks into your house in the middle of the night to patch in more sigils
[1:06:32] <+captain_history> the og sigil fighter
[1:06:35] <Man_in_the_Red> theyre electric C4
[1:06:37] <+Chronoreyer> if you make a mistake and he sets orbs you lost neutral full stop
[1:06:37] <Thunderhog> War Misdemenors
[1:06:39] <Tyth3sly> No it's the +27 aub almost fullscreen lighting orbs that track that make him top tier
[1:06:49] <lem______> bleh
[1:06:51] <lem______> smelly
[1:06:52] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Frame tapping babyyy
[1:06:55] <inyalga> KACHOW
[1:06:58] <Fimbulvetr090> you hit it to the combo to reduce damage
[1:07:00] <narcowski> Those too @Tyth3sly
[1:07:01] <Fiendmaw> If you time your buttons with the combo,you reduce the damage
[1:07:04] <DaBigCheat> all i found was the download but i already got it. unless i super missed something
[1:07:07] <Fimbulvetr090> you don't mash it, you time it to the hitsounds
[1:07:10] <MasterIcarus7> it's a 30% reduction per hit
[1:07:10] <Vashido22> Time the button presses to the combo
[1:07:13] <Vashido22> it reduces damage
[1:07:15] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> You need to frame tap to reduce damage
[1:07:20] <Tyth3sly> yeah while you're getting hit you can press buttons int he rhythm of the hits to reduce it by 30%
[1:07:32] <garrulousAuthority> When is someone just going to cut the middleman and make a Sigil Fighter
[1:07:39] <OkamiDude15> you mean touhou?
[1:07:41] <Who_lio42> not by mashing, you have to know their combo and time button presses
[1:07:42] <@Solidus_113> beautiful
[1:07:45] <AMWACloak> Don't Mash Rhythm Game to the sound of getting your ass beat.
[1:07:48] <inyalga> @ANGRA_MAlNYU When you say frame tapping baby i have Dio saying baby in my mind from when the VA voiced acted as deadpool in the avengers anime like it seems so fitting
[1:07:50] <+Chronoreyer> @Solidus_113 use 236c more!

[1:08:05] <%phatmac16> .....?
[1:08:05] <Vashido22> is woolie taking games from anyone?
[1:08:06] <Thunderhog> Yeah, it's why you gotta learn the beat of your average BNB
[1:08:08] <%DreyfussFrost> Mashing won't work, damage reduction is timed.
[1:08:10] <MasterIcarus7> i wanna punch the gang with aoko
[1:08:11] <paizurihokage> @WoolieVersus you hit the button at the sound of the hit to take less damage and build more meter
[1:08:13] <spinbel> DOXXED
[1:08:14] <grenadier42> d e s k t o p
[1:08:16] <Man_in_the_Red> so instead of mashing like VSAV you do it to the hitsounds
