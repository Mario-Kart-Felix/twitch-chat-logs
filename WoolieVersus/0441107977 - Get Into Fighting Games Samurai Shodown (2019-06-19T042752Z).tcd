[0:25:59] <fattydragon> from what I've heard, seen, and played, 1 was fine, 2 and 5 are the best, 3 is not good, 4 is ____, 6 is okay maybe??
[0:26:03] <Jontman42> Why does he need so many swords
[0:26:03] <+linkwolf4> SamSho is ALL Nooch baby.

[0:26:06] <BusterRepukken> imagine Jetstream Sam in this game.
[0:26:07] <Spavorkian> that is an irresponsible amount of swords
[0:26:10] <+paladinstarbuster> HER BAPS
[0:26:13] <fattydragon> there was also a samurai shodown rpg on the NEOGEO

[0:26:28] <+TopTieramisu> i hate how people keep saying this game looks like sf4. this game is way more stylized than sf4
[0:26:43] <FacetiousAF> but yeah yoshitora you have to do like 6 or so specific moves to unlock that last, long ass sword
[0:26:46] <%thetrashman_sc> BIG DAMAGE

[0:27:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> @FrustratedAF yoshi can either do all the 6 sword attacks he has to bust out #7, or he can do his super desperation move

[0:27:55] <+TopTieramisu> @DingusMcBaseball i won't deny that it has a lot of similarities. but i don't agree with it being said in a disparaging manner. i think it's a better execution on what sf4 was going for
[0:28:00] <FacetiousAF> still need to buy the game tho :/ gotta get that season pass
[0:28:16] <fattydragon> hitboxes babyyy
[0:28:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> Big Risk big reward

[0:42:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> that's right. you can only unlock it for that round
[0:42:33] <MainManJonadiah> I like that he reaches for the sword and then goes "no, wait, I haven't unlocked it yet."

[0:43:04] <MainManJonadiah> @TopTieramisu Bloodborne trick weapon
[0:43:08] <Triplicat> if you want to see it you need to restart, use SSM round start, then spam the command for fun
[0:43:08] <$Mighty_observer> you know, for a country with a extreme low birth rate japan sure is down for drilling
[0:43:09] <spawnzie> you REALLY have to sleep

[0:45:37] <Triplicat> she doesn't because ruxiang has the lightning powers instead
[0:45:53] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu her sword is her stand
[0:45:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:47:34] <+VersusOmnibus> lytSTUMBLE
[0:47:35] <Triplicat> WFT does NOT require rage activate
[0:47:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[0:47:40] <$Mighty_observer> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug oh boy what you got comming Kappa
[0:47:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> all it needs is just full rage
[0:47:45] <Triplicat> just full rage gauge
[0:47:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> Even the supers have mix ups
[0:47:54] <Triplicat> yeah super important to know this
[0:47:58] <@Menitta> "Conclusion" is the best round finish phrase
[0:48:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> they got rid of meditation here (and the weapon power meter)
[0:48:09] <rufus2k2> "did you know your eyes were dead" ??
[0:48:10] <+TopTieramisu> i love this game's full commitment to its aesthetic
[0:48:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah Jimmy's got it right lol
[0:48:18] <jubejube56> Did you know that your eyes were dead? Wat
[0:48:29] <+JakeSG> can you still rage burst?
[0:48:31] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 Jaden smit?
[0:48:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeh
[0:48:39] <%deadredeyez> @jubejube56 yes
[0:48:45] <+GraveLordJeff> @WoolieVersus random quetion is it normal for top players to charge you money for a autograph
[0:48:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> rage burst is still ABC any time
[0:48:49] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer :D
[0:48:58] <$Mighty_observer> lol
[0:49:06] <+Prinnylordninjocity> IS THAT SEANS SUPER???
[0:49:14] <Kaendorth> her moves are sick, but the wft isn't so cool
[0:49:32] <+Detectivemac9> darli's weapon is straight up a saw cleaver and it's buggin me
[0:49:37] <Triplicat> it's issen that you need to be in rage explosion for
[0:49:46] <jubejube56> So can you combo into the disarm super at all?
[0:49:51] <Triplicat> uhhh
[0:49:54] <jubejube56> Like off back throw
[0:50:02] <+TopTieramisu> @Detectivemac9 it's also a hammer and drill
[0:50:09] <%wolfofsound> Say "I need my king butterfly"
[0:50:10] <+Detectivemac9> what
[0:50:17] <Triplicat> it is comboable off high levels of deflect for sure but I don't think that's what you're asking for
[0:50:29] <Kaendorth> @TopTieramisu yeah, i saw a glimpse of that, how does she change?
[0:50:32] <+JakeSG> real question. can you still sudouku with 4632start?
[0:50:41] <+TopTieramisu> @Kaendorth specific moves or supers
[0:50:42] <MainManJonadiah> Ground command throw
[0:50:56] <jubejube56> Well I guess getting it off a deflect is enough
[0:50:58] <+TopTieramisu> it just does. darli magic, i guess
[0:51:03] <%mr_sups> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[0:51:06] <$Mighty_observer> soooooooooo, who da fuq is this yoshitora? im sure hes not a real tokugawa
[0:51:11] <+RichardMF_> @woolieversus That just the command grab
[0:51:11] <Kaendorth> oj cool, does she keep it or is it just for the cinematic?
[0:51:12] <$Mighty_observer> he will be beheaded
[0:51:13] <+TheyTookMyBeard> early copy?
[0:51:14] <KingFossilFER> @WoolieVersus yoshi can do his air special move from a backdash or kara cancelling the overhead
[0:51:21] <Triplicat> you can get SSM off deflect which is going to blow everyone up week 1
[0:51:29] <Triplicat> or at least day 1
[0:51:42] <+TopTieramisu> yoshitora is an existing samsho character
[0:51:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> that also means... ukyo backdash firebird is a thing
[0:52:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> backdash tsubame rather
[0:52:09] <$Mighty_observer> @TheyTookMyBeard woolie is a big youtuber that has all the cloat
[0:52:11] <+TopTieramisu> tsubame gaeshi
[0:52:13] <President_valentine> back dash tsubame Kreygasm
[0:52:16] <SuckPuppet> I've missed having a "traditional" 2D game to get into BibleThump
[0:52:18] <COMB711> tthat shit is nuts with ukyo
[0:52:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dat foot tap doe
[0:52:23] <%jinking79> om dpad it tough
[0:52:24] <KingFossilFER> then maybe just the overhead in this game
[0:52:25] <Triplicat> he still has 2D tsubame IIRC
[0:52:28] <+TheyTookMyBeard> @Mighty_observer hes big RT boy now
[0:52:30] <Triplicat> or rather he has it
[0:52:33] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu really? why nobody play as him XD
[0:52:39] <+geobuster> buffer > backdash > button
[0:52:49] <jubejube56> Maybe it just isn’t a thing in this game?
[0:52:54] <$Mighty_observer> @TheyTookMyBeard or as we like to call him... a sell out
[0:52:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:52:59] <+RichardMF_> it is a thi g
[0:53:00] <+solzan2000> I think yoshi has a cmd grab?
[0:53:02] <+RichardMF_> thjng
[0:53:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah he has a cmd grab
[0:53:16] <+TopTieramisu> i always liked yoshitora. i think he was added in samsho 5?
[0:53:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> DP+Kick i think
[0:53:25] <+solzan2000> ok cool
[0:53:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> @TopTieramisu yup that's correct
[0:53:32] <Triplicat> @WoolieVersus if you just want to see it, restart, do his SSM round start so the opponent survives in the same round, then do the command
[0:53:40] <$Mighty_observer> never seen him
[0:53:43] <Triplicat> otherwise it'll just relock when the round ends
[0:53:57] <+TopTieramisu> @Mighty_observer he's like the main character of 5, i think
[0:53:59] <%TheSleepParty> Do they have Gaoh tho
[0:54:17] <$Mighty_observer> i didnt play samsho 5
[0:54:20] <+TopTieramisu> guess he's kind of like samsho's alex lol
[0:54:39] <+solzan2000> did they use the 7th sword attack?
[0:54:41] <CHVMPLOO> cant wait for pc release
[0:55:04] <Triplicat> LMAO
[0:55:07] <%mr_sups> THE FINAL POWER THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED
[0:55:07] <+solzan2000> there it is
[0:55:09] <Triplicat> and he can keep doing it
[0:55:12] <%TheSleepParty> im skeptical about pc release. their other snk games on steam have some janky netcord
[0:55:13] <jubejube56> Didn’t do command grab
[0:55:14] <krymzen5> dooope
[0:55:16] <+TopTieramisu> POWER GEYSER

[1:08:10] <MainManJonadiah> You thought she was done?
[1:08:22] <%gatorafan> Personally I'm a sucker for these unconventional swords. woolieGASM
[1:08:30] <+Sayie> Darli doesn't give a fuck if you block, she want's that hit
[1:08:38] <Vashido22> Galford's va sounds so familiar
[1:08:43] <+thespikespiegel> !discord
[1:08:52] <rufus2k2> that pirouette kick is so delicate yet strong
[1:09:04] <$Mighty_observer> @Vashido22 sounds like a main charecter...
[1:09:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> internet says Galford's Wataru Komada
[1:09:18] <jubejube56> Galford already making himself look like an online menace
[1:09:36] <CanadianWolverine> Unconventional sword? It looks like a damn over sized pull saw
[1:09:37] <TungstenViper> @vashido22 it sounds like Chipp from GG to me
[1:09:38] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:09:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> kind reminder you can cancel the "weapon recoil" animation
[1:09:45] <$Mighty_observer> @Guntanks_in_Space wataru from that mecha show with the dragon?
[1:10:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> hang on
[1:10:17] <+TopTieramisu> that's weird
[1:10:25] <MainManJonadiah> When you say "weapon recoil," do you mean you can cancel attack recovery?
[1:10:42] <TungstenViper> why only 3?
[1:10:47] <krymzen5> i think its when u bounce off
[1:10:50] <cerazor01> I think Woolie would be better as somebody else.
[1:10:59] <%gatorafan> Day 1 Earthquake will be fun to see.
[1:11:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> nope, Komada's a relatively new one
[1:11:11] <Vashido22> I want to use my girl Shiki so bad
[1:11:13] <beatie_g> is this a demo?
[1:11:13] <+TopTieramisu> wait does samsho not have true autoblock after the first hit?
[1:11:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> awe damn
[1:11:20] <jubejube56> That was just a 2 hit combo
[1:11:26] <KingFossilFER> when your attack is blocked and you are in that recoil animation, you can cancel it into a special moves or defelct
[1:11:27] <$Mighty_observer> yeah i saw, im disapointed

[1:16:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> how about Yoshitora
[1:16:18] <+SaltySombrero> did I miss Yoshitora
[1:16:23] <$Mighty_observer> @Guntanks_in_Space thats some type casting
[1:16:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> use him reggie, you have so many more swords, how can you lose
[1:16:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @WG101
[1:16:32] <+OmegaWeltall> ya know, i never fully appreciate this game back in teh day
[1:16:48] <+JossyJoestar> i love the hit stop in this
[1:16:49] <%mr_sups> Dignified is a good term for the pace.
[1:16:53] <+JossyJoestar> everything looks so powerful
[1:16:54] <%jinking79> how is Genjuro and Iori not related
[1:16:55] <+TopTieramisu> this game needs a character with norio wakamoto's voice
[1:17:04] <+SaltySombrero> @OmegaWeltall right now's a good time to try. One of the best in the series, SamSho V Special is on sale (or free on fightcade)
[1:17:05] <+MutedMimic> LUL
[1:17:06] <+TopTieramisu> @jinking79 who knows?
[1:17:06] <+JossyJoestar> timeout? Pog
[1:17:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mighty_observer the dude's also been Genjuro for a long-ass time too so it's fair game lol
[1:17:09] <+TopTieramisu> maybe they are
[1:17:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> this game still uses snk motions like in KOF doesn't it
[1:17:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> for the most part @CaptainPileDriver
[1:17:26] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu well if you see any charecter wearing RED
[1:17:27] <+geobuster> Genjuro's DP looks majestic
[1:17:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> like, SDMs are f,hcf+C+D i think? but no pretzels
[1:17:34] <+OmegaWeltall> ah cool, might check it out SeemsGood
[1:17:34] <rufus2k2> @TopTieramisu apparently it did, Golba
[1:17:35] <SuckPuppet> I first played this on Game Gear so it has been ruined forever
[1:17:43] <%mr_sups> I want to see a drinking match between Genjuro and Darli.
[1:17:44] <%Solidnick18> what
[1:17:45] <+OmegaWeltall> i kind alike how its slow and methodical
[1:17:46] <$cherubs_anonymous> YOU CAN HOLD IT
[1:17:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> for the record, the GB Samsho games are dope
[1:17:55] <Vashido22> Charlotte is so much fun in V
[1:17:56] <%Solidnick18> that's nuts
[1:17:57] <WG101> @mistersups daril would win, hands down
[1:17:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, i don't much care for snk motions on pad but this game is much slower so
[1:18:00] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[1:18:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> yes it crosses up, but you can still block it
[1:18:00] <%SkaiVibration> SkaiVibration subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! SAMSHO TIME woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:18:08] <%Solidnick18> chill
[1:18:11] <+OmegaWeltall> dat DMG PogChamp
[1:18:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> genjuro fuckin' rulles
[1:18:13] <$Mighty_observer> @Guntanks_in_Space i guess, but he goes from playing a evil muscle dude to playing a evil muscle dude with a sword
[1:18:13] <+JossyJoestar> if that came out a little sooner might have been a kill
[1:18:26] <%Solidnick18> woolie is sick
[1:18:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> dat boi
[1:18:30] <+TopTieramisu> manly parasol

[1:18:48] <DadOnTheInternet> Genjuro dunked on Charlotte
[1:18:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> the funny thing about Samurai Iori is that, Iori and Kyo's ancestors showed up in the Samsho RPG
[1:18:57] <CraZ80> @WoolieVersus is this a review copy?
[1:18:58] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu only the most menly of men
[1:19:04] <Vashido22> Wasn't Charlotte in love with haohmaru or something? I don't remember a lot of samsho's story
[1:19:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOSHITORA
[1:19:08] <rufus2k2> Yo bring back Golba for this game, he was voiced by Wakamoto
[1:19:09] <+JossyJoestar> shiki got teleports
[1:19:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> so you got Kyo rocking Saisyu's garb, and Iori with something similar but with the Yagami crescent moon emblem
[1:19:13] <President_valentine> @vashido22 yeah

[1:24:36] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus woolie how stiff ARE your pants from all this darli play?
[1:24:37] <$Mighty_observer> lordji1Cooked
[1:24:42] <%thetrashman_sc> shes no darli
[1:24:42] <rufus2k2> poppy gotta bury her master :(
[1:24:51] <%mighty_max_t> Galford just sounds like Chipp Zanuff and Charlotte sounds like KoF King. Are they the same voice actors?
[1:24:51] <rufus2k2> darli is darli
[1:24:56] <jubejube56> She is okay
[1:24:58] <Thenuclearwalrus> @CanadianWolverine There are special sheathes that allow it, usually the side has a cut out of it, kinda defeats the purpose of a sheath though
[1:24:58] <+TopTieramisu> @Mighty_observer lol. i was talking about the character from kof
[1:25:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> funnily enough no
[1:25:20] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu ahhhhhh
[1:25:28] <rufus2k2> @MightyMaxT seems to be a new guy, funnily enough he does a bunch of foreigner characters in anime
[1:25:29] <Sarumarine> Machine Gun Dog, hahah
[1:25:30] <Vashido22> Good old SNK motions
[1:25:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> @MightyMaxT like, Char's got a new VA but she USED to be voiced by King's VA in the older games
[1:25:47] <rufus2k2> one of his credits is AMERICAN MAN
[1:25:52] <Vashido22> @Guntanks_in_Space the double waifu energy was too powerful
[1:25:53] <%thetrashman_sc> King Kreygasm
[1:25:54] <krymzen5> gonna take me a bit to get used to snk motions again
[1:25:55] <Vashido22> so they had to change it
[1:25:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> Afumi Hashi (Char's new VA) replaced Harumi Ikoma (Char's former VA, also King/Blue Mary and what have you)
[1:25:58] <gammongaming11> you don't need a special sheeth for your sword if it's short
[1:26:02] <@Menitta> Man Charlotte is so cool
[1:26:07] <gammongaming11> and that sword is basically\ a large dagger.
[1:26:12] <%mighty_max_t> @Guntanks_in_Space Huh, what do you know. Thanks for the info!

[1:27:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> also kind reminder that Galford isn't the only American ninja in this game

[1:27:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> basically Earthquake is from Texas
[1:27:35] <%gatorafan> reminder that Andrew Jackson is a character in this series.

[1:30:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> Last Blade was more combo-happy compared to this
[1:30:46] <MainManJonadiah> Apple-tech
[1:30:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> while Samsho was always "make this fucking hit count"
[1:30:49] <jubejube56> Isn’t there a simple fighting game that does that?
[1:30:52] <+heyitsdenzel_> Lets go Vergil
[1:30:56] <President_valentine> Apples
[1:30:57] <+EndgameContent> Doctors hate it!
[1:31:00] <+TopTieramisu> @Guntanks_in_Space fuuuuck. i want a new last blade
[1:31:10] <krymzen5> mvc3, just screw lifebars
[1:31:13] <%jinking79> for 100 of years
[1:31:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> BISHI BISHI
[1:31:18] <+TopTieramisu> or put hibiki in samsho
[1:31:19] <$Mighty_observer> a apple a day didnt help him
[1:31:19] <SolGoodguy> Ukyo has tuberculosis?
[1:31:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> there's the backdash Tsubame
[1:31:21] <+TopTieramisu> i'd be fine with that
[1:31:25] <Vashido22> @SolGoodguy yeah
[1:31:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> @SolGoodguy yes, he's kinda been dealing with that
[1:31:30] <rufus2k2> @SolGoodguy yeah refuses to die tho
[1:31:31] <President_valentine> thats a godlike move
[1:31:32] <+m__w> have we confirmed or denied 2D comboing into TK Tsubame?
[1:31:33] <SolGoodguy> damn dude thats rough
[1:31:38] <+solzan2000> hes been ill for 30 years
[1:31:41] <%thetrashman_sc> can we get yoshimitsu as a guest character Kappa
[1:31:45] <%gatorafan> No wonder he's dying if he keeps all the doctors away with those apples daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:31:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> hmmmm, i'm sure someone's tested 2D into backdash Tsubame
[1:31:48] <rufus2k2> also very faithful to his wife
[1:31:49] <+SaltySombrero> Ukyo fiighint the good fight
[1:31:53] <SolGoodguy> yfw when you learn a character has tuberculosis and the treatment for it only was created in 1900
[1:31:56] <rufus2k2> which is why he cuts and runs from the fangirls
[1:31:57] <SolGoodguy> BibleThump
[1:32:00] <+geobuster> Ukyo wastes food, don't be like Ukyo
[1:32:01] <$Mighty_observer> the lightning fast 1 slash samurai thats fastly dying
[1:32:09] <+TopTieramisu> @gatorafan the apples are why he's survived over a decade with TB
[1:32:10] <jubejube56> I can see why the ladies go after Ukyo now
[1:32:18] <SolGoodguy> he's moe
[1:32:26] <+m__w> I would be very surprised if Ukyo 2D can combo into TK Tsubame but I'm curious
[1:32:28] <%shmupdogjoe> Ladies like a dude who coughs up blood
[1:32:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> also fun trivia: Ukyo was supposed to be Haohmaru's rival (like how we got Musashi vs Kojiro), but then Genjuro showed up
[1:32:37] <CanadianWolverine> Can she cut the apple too?
[1:32:47] <Sarumarine> Nice roll
[1:32:52] <SolGoodguy> ukyo has a very kojiro look indeed
[1:32:52] <$Mighty_observer> @jubejube56 and as soon as they get him he dies in their arms, makes them extra hot
[1:33:01] <President_valentine> tsubame can reflect projectiles
[1:33:04] <clapbeat> ukyo is the main rival in samsho 1
[1:33:06] <rufus2k2> the range on that stab!
[1:33:07] <+TopTieramisu> @Guntanks_in_Space yeah. he basically got the Paul v Kazuya treatment
[1:33:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> Samurais are but just Bigger Swallows - Ukyo Tachibana, probably
[1:33:11] <%wolfofsound> ukyo pulling some kenshin shit
[1:33:13] <Triplicat> 甘い
[1:33:16] <+MutedMimic> PogChamp
[1:33:27] <$Mighty_observer> well he was already dead so...
[1:33:29] <SolGoodguy> man the trailers were really lessened with the blood
[1:33:29] <TungstenViper> AUREVOIR!!
[1:33:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> nothing ruins an online game like a the other guy with a mic
[1:33:29] <KingFossilFER> dash B crosses up
[1:33:44] <krymzen5> all u did was make his disease faster
[1:33:45] <SuckPuppet> @wolfofsound Allegedly?
[1:33:46] <SolGoodguy> glad to see there's still the slicing in half mechanic n' shit
[1:34:00] <%gatorafan> Fear not the man who practices a thousand slashes once, but the man who Tsubame Gaeshi a thousand times daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:34:12] <%wolfofsound> @PumpkinSong kenshin not watsuki
[1:34:14] <tigerarar> the whf
[1:34:16] <+SaltySombrero> super duper
[1:34:21] <SuckPuppet> fair enough
[1:34:23] <tigerarar> wft
[1:34:30] <$Mighty_observer> To much french
[1:34:39] <Triplicat> 🥖
[1:34:43] <%shmupdogjoe> I dunno, that guy probably learned some interesting things doing 10000 different slashes
[1:34:43] <$Mighty_observer> speak the lords ENGLISH
[1:35:05] <krymzen5> sorry, i don't speak COWARD
[1:35:38] <$Mighty_observer> @krymzen5 isnt that french tho? Kappa
[1:35:38] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:35:41] <%thetrashman_sc> charlotte op pls nerf
[1:35:41] <+SaltySombrero> there is natural chipdeath
[1:35:43] <rufus2k2> bet we'll see a reversal update in the near future
[1:35:46] <KingFossilFER> @WoolieVersus special moves and supers chip. When unarmed everything chips
[1:35:52] <krymzen5> @Mighty_observer yes, yes it is LUL
[1:35:53] <+SaltySombrero> However, if you're unarmed, Normals do chip damage. This is pretty important
[1:36:07] <$Mighty_observer> LUL
[1:36:09] <%thetrashman_sc> which makes sense tbh
[1:36:21] <rufus2k2> dat after image tho
[1:36:23] <jubejube56> I think if a Japanese symbol appears where the combo counter normally goes, that is a sign of a proper punish
[1:36:29] <jubejube56> Just from what I can see
[1:36:31] <@Menitta> I'm bummed this comes out in June. There are too many games out this month woolieDATTEBAYO

[1:40:45] <krymzen5> Ukyos a good boi

[1:40:45] <%wolfofsound> girls are ALWAYS watching
[1:40:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah, Ukyo loves Kei that he HAS to run away from the other fangirls
[1:40:48] <President_valentine> SHIKI
[1:40:50] <@Menitta> Shiki is cool
[1:40:52] <+SaltySombrero> 5A of the Lord
[1:40:54] <jubejube56> The translation game is strong with this ine
[1:40:55] <%mr_sups> @Mighty_observer no child porn, so no.
[1:40:56] <Haiizo> os cara da ban se fica falando em BR aqui ?
[1:40:58] <%thetrashman_sc> tam-tam is monkaS
[1:41:03] <Tajy_Venom> does anyone remember the historical reference of haohmaru vs ukyo and the stage being night time? i think it had to do with musashi being late to a duel to someone ukyo was influenced by. was it something like that?
[1:41:11] <krymzen5> Shiji was a char i def wanted in
[1:41:13] <@Menitta> This game and stream shows me how little I know about Sam Sho
[1:41:23] <MainManJonadiah> Yo! That's a big man!
[1:41:27] <rufus2k2> Tam Tam with the manlet respect
[1:41:32] <$Mighty_observer> @mistersups well is he actually coughing or is he looking at some pictures?
[1:41:33] <%mr_sups> Faust from Guilty Gear?
[1:41:34] <RadShiro> THAT MAN IS A UNIT
[1:41:36] <%thetrashman_sc> thats one big man baby
[1:41:37] <ahame94> what in the goddamn piillar man is he
[1:41:38] <TigerClaws12> holy hips batman
[1:41:48] <%wolfofsound> @Tajy_Venom he was late to a duel so the sun would be at his back making his opponent take a disadvantage
[1:41:50] <%jinking79> does his little sis show up on his victory?
[1:41:52] <+RowenCleric> my dude is bigger than the damn bear in the background
[1:41:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Tajy_Venom the quintessential timer scam really. Musashi intentionally went late for his duel with Kojiro so that the sun is behind him and Kojiro would be blinded
[1:41:53] <Haiizo> iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[1:41:55] <+SaltySombrero> SNK always kills it on the music
[1:41:58] <greasystreams> Kreygasm

[1:42:01] <rufus2k2> skullroll!
[1:42:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> also the late-ness made Kojiro lose his edge
[1:42:13] <$Mighty_observer> Tam is just better woolie
[1:42:21] <President_valentine> ooga booga
[1:42:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> also let's not forget the part with the sharpened oar
[1:42:29] <Tajy_Venom> was that what the stage being night in the original was referencing when they are matched?
[1:42:38] <%mr_sups> @Mighty_observer he hid the pictures in his lungs.
[1:42:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:42:39] <%thetrashman_sc> we dont need to be... worried about tam tam right?
[1:42:41] <%gatorafan> woolieCHAN
[1:42:42] <Man_in_the_Red> Review copy?
[1:42:43] <Triplicat> OOGA BOOGA
[1:42:46] <@Menitta> The animations in this are way smoother than they were in KOFXIV
[1:42:50] <Haiizo> kkkkk
[1:42:50] <krymzen5> i wonder if we'll see a last blade char in the dlc
[1:43:06] <rufus2k2> that spin animation is sick
[1:43:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeh it's a review copy
[1:43:16] <$Mighty_observer> @mistersups thats how you avoid prison... or at least a $1000 fee
[1:43:18] <rufus2k2> WHAT THE FUCK
[1:43:20] <coracor> VORE monkaS
[1:43:25] <Purest1> WutFace

[1:44:04] <krymzen5> oh god that zoning
[1:44:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> reminder that tam tam can do late Jump C into early jump C
[1:44:11] <%mr_sups> More like a toned down Faust
[1:44:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> he's kind of a jackass
[1:44:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> PAGNA PAGNA
[1:44:28] <jubejube56> Morrigan flashbacks
[1:44:31] <TomCrimson> so happy Tam Tam is in this one, he's all I can play lmao

[1:45:11] <KingFossilFER> wan fu?
[1:45:21] <@Menitta> I remember Tam Tam from Saltybet woolieREMEMBERS
[1:45:26] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 nope, get ready for more nintendo warriors
[1:45:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> saltybet teaches me many things about a life bar
[1:45:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> Wan Fu did have a similar sword
[1:45:42] <@Menitta> boy does it @CaptainPileDriver
[1:45:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> but later on he uses an uprooted pillar
[1:45:45] <rufus2k2> also Amakusa returning to show Menat lovers what's up
[1:45:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> Amakusa was the OG Ball Handler
[1:45:56] <%rhymeslikedimes> Are they playing the 8f or 4f lag version..?
[1:46:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> god i've lost so much saltybucks so fast
[1:46:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> Menat and Viola owe it to him lol
[1:46:15] <krymzen5> i think the 4f is a day 1 patch but idk
[1:46:17] <$Mighty_observer> i dont know if this is racist...
[1:46:27] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer my face when Fire Emblem characters get in before him NotLikeThis
[1:46:29] <%mr_sups> Hiiiips
[1:46:35] <MainManJonadiah> I don't know why, but seeing Tam tam's mouth under the mask is really weird to me.
[1:46:48] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 thats about right
[1:47:11] <DSD24> @MainMan_Jonadiah I mean its weird seeing any facial features of a character if they wear a mask all the time
[1:47:46] <coracor> WOO WOO WOOOO
[1:47:46] <DSD24> Big Damge
[1:47:47] <$Mighty_observer> dats racist
[1:47:49] <rufus2k2> @MainMan_Jonadiah I think in the 2d games it was more of a full mask but now with SUPER TECH you can give it more detail
[1:48:24] <%mr_sups> NOM NOM NOM
[1:48:27] <rufus2k2> that's so sick
[1:48:31] <$Mighty_observer> dats extremly racist
[1:48:37] <DSD24> Shiki's really cool
[1:48:40] <rufus2k2> man's gotta eat
[1:48:55] <rufus2k2> I wonder if Tam Tam will come back..
[1:49:02] <krymzen5> we'd all eat shiki if we could chat Kappa

[1:50:08] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[1:50:14] <President_valentine> Her personality is also based on Rei
[1:50:24] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer inorite
[1:50:27] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:50:27] <DSD24> Not all waifus have heterochromeia
[1:50:37] <MainManJonadiah> All the good ones do
[1:50:42] <%mr_sups> If you get hit... It's your fault!
[1:50:44] <%gatorafan> isn't she also super pregnant by Satan or something?
[1:50:49] <krymzen5> i'm sorry for starting this but
[1:50:57] <krymzen5> Asuka> Rei
[1:50:58] <%mighty_max_t> Could Strider-Hiryu work as a SamSho guest? Or would he have too many moves with the Options
[1:51:00] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 just being alive means bounce... and sometimes being dead means BIG BOUNCE
[1:51:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> i forget her lore but i don't think she's super preggo by satan
[1:51:04] <rufus2k2> that's a really good victory howl
[1:51:09] <+m__w> not every waifu has heterochromia, but every girl with heterochromia is a waifu
[1:51:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> but the cult she fought for had some really fucked up ways to make giant abomination babies
[1:51:17] <MainManJonadiah> @krymzen5 You're sorry for starting THE TRUTH?!
[1:51:23] <DSD24> Look at that cool bear
[1:51:25] <President_valentine> she does have a child but i forget who the father is
[1:51:27] <@Menitta> WOW

[1:51:38] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> spin to win
[1:51:38] <TungstenViper> GET FUKD
[1:51:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> silly fan canon states that she's Genjuro's mom
[1:51:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> as a joke
[1:51:48] <ameraaaaaa> is this shamsho
[1:51:55] <krymzen5> @MainMan_Jonadiah they rejected me, because i speak the truth!
[1:51:59] <rufus2k2> no this is patrick!
[1:52:06] <jubejube56> Sudden realization tam tam wears the woolie colours
[1:52:08] <SuckPuppet> I do not want to fight Tam Tam
[1:52:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah lol
[1:52:25] <+SaltySombrero> It's okay, just fight the Green Hell man
[1:52:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> Tam's rocking the Woolie motif
[1:52:35] <ameraaaaaa> who's woolie's character
[1:52:40] <President_valentine> Darli

[1:52:51] <ahame94> His Namesake, Darli
[1:52:54] <krymzen5> Tam Tam looks like he'll be a problem online
[1:52:55] <$Mighty_observer> for a proto space marine, TAM TAM is fast
[1:52:58] <rufus2k2> I like that win quote from before telling Shiki get some sun
[1:52:58] <MainManJonadiah> What's that touhou shit with the skulls?!
[1:53:02] <%mr_sups> HitBOX
[1:53:05] <DSD24> Is Tam Tam like 8 feet tall or something?
[1:53:05] <ameraaaaaa> woolie bait
[1:53:15] <+SaltySombrero> Tam's real tall
[1:53:18] <+SaltySombrero> so maybe
[1:53:18] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer you ever see the Astartes clips on youtube? Space marines ARE really fast
[1:53:21] <President_valentine> Something like that
[1:53:27] <%wolfofsound> tam tam comes up and slap's your girl? What do you do? What DO you do?!
[1:53:36] <Man_in_the_Red> @dsd24 taller than shiki crouched, at least 10 feet
[1:53:37] <%wolfofsound> slaps*
[1:53:38] <$Mighty_observer> @DSD24 well hes twice the size of everybody else so...
[1:53:41] <krymzen5> she's his girl now
[1:53:42] <jubejube56> So tam tam is a cross between a tohou character and Yoshimitsu?
[1:53:42] <President_valentine> I think Earthquake might be slightly taller
[1:53:43] <rufus2k2> tam tam dance is good
[1:53:44] <MainManJonadiah> According to the SNK wiki, Tam Tam is 9' 4"
[1:53:46] <EnlightenedKramer> die I guess
[1:53:49] <ameraaaaaa> @dsd24 no tam tam is 80 foot tall and everyone's a kaiju
[1:53:53] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 true, and big
[1:54:01] <MainManJonadiah> Earthquake is 9'6"
[1:54:03] <DSD24> @MainMan_Jonadiah Man I was so close on that guess
[1:54:28] <%gatorafan> Tam Tam's size is "bigger than you" Kappa
[1:54:31] <+SaltySombrero> Earthquake is fat evil
[1:54:37] <DSD24> I like the character select screen

[1:55:51] <rufus2k2> scorpion hanzo
[1:55:53] <EnlightenedKramer> if only Tam Tam had a standing stance if he fought another Tam Ta
[1:55:59] <%mighty_max_t> Don't look at Hanzo mains, don't shake their hands
[1:56:04] <cherrycottontail> that hanzo cant see shit with that stance

[2:12:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> the fat to thicc that the edge won't cut
[2:12:42] <krymzen5> i'd say ukyos toolset is more vergil
[2:12:46] <BusterRepukken> does anyone have a judgement cut or slash
[2:12:47] <SolGoodguy> shiki and him are the edgelords first picks
[2:12:52] <MainManJonadiah> I thought Yashamaru was just an edgelord at first, but his design has grown on me, he's pretty sick.
[2:12:54] <%shmupdogjoe> I wonder if it is physically possible to get so fat that it gets harder to kill you with a sword irl

[2:28:55] <rufus2k2> with a single foot even
[2:29:13] <+EightFootOctopus> he jumps high cuz he has big buttons, and he should still have his down slash in air spin
[2:29:13] <$Mighty_observer> @wolfofsound only in anime, not IRL

[2:30:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> Getting out of Fighting Games: Kabuki Warriors

[2:31:09] <+KillMyPast> That water effect looks great
[2:31:13] <$Mighty_observer> @MainMan_Jonadiah he has the child porn vol 1-9999
[2:31:21] <%shmupdogjoe> I did like spamming that frog but me and my friends didn’t really know how to play samsho 5 special
[2:31:27] <krymzen5> yea, special dmg seems nerfed in general. which i'm ok with
[2:31:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> @EightFootOctopus i believe Meaty Frog setups were a thing
[2:31:35] <%wolfofsound> @MainMan_Jonadiah he's also kumadori from OP
[2:31:46] <+EightFootOctopus> down slash in air should also be a crossup
[2:32:05] <SouthPawPad> wait how is he playing this?
[2:32:06] <+EightFootOctopus> and you can down slash after bacdash
[2:32:11] <krymzen5> glad they didn't bring back stamina
[2:32:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:32:13] <%thetrashman_sc> yooooooooo
[2:32:18] <GoldeNOVA> Where did that archetype come from? I imagine some old Japanese tale.
[2:32:20] <MainManJonadiah> @wolfofsound Had to google to remember which character that was, but you're ABSOLUTELY right.
[2:32:29] <%thetrashman_sc> kabuki theatre
[2:32:49] <+RoboBro1212> yooooOOOOO~
[2:32:52] <%shmupdogjoe> kabuki was well known for trained giant frogs back in the day
[2:32:57] <$Mighty_observer> @GoldeNOVA A old japanes shaman basically
[2:33:05] <+SaltySombrero> Kaiswer...WAVE
[2:33:19] <Hacerous> dont litter
[2:33:23] <GoldeNOVA> He vanished?
[2:33:27] <paptert> dude just casually cuts him in half
[2:33:31] <+MutedMimic> LUL
[2:33:35] <+solzan2000> lol
[2:33:39] <MainManJonadiah> Damn Jubei, that's cold
[2:33:39] <%wolfofsound> @MainMan_Jonadiah it's pretty uncanny
[2:33:40] <%thetrashman_sc> so how come kof14 looked kinda wack but this looks sick
[2:33:51] <jetswerve> money
[2:33:54] <krymzen5> the punchy guy from 4 special could be cool just for variety
[2:33:56] <$Mighty_observer> because japan doesnt like body horror, until they REALLY like body horroe
[2:33:59] <+TopTieramisu> man, jubei's so cool that i wish there was a younger version of him
[2:33:59] <+Rabbitmage> Jubei crosses swords around men.
[2:33:59] <Quikanims> jubei is a savage
[2:34:05] <+SaltySombrero> Jiimmy, win using only st.B with Charlotte
[2:34:11] <+SaltySombrero> use the nooch
[2:34:24] <+solzan2000> this stage is a stage!
[2:34:31] <BeijiWeng> Imagine next Kof, Thank you LUL
[2:34:33] <DSD24> @fFailureatlife Probably because KOF 14 was their first game in a long time whereas this probably got more time
[2:34:36] <+TopTieramisu> this stage actually makes me think of sfxt
[2:34:39] <MainManJonadiah> Oh shit! This stage IS a stage!
[2:34:47] <+EightFootOctopus> yea kyoshiro eats shit if he whiffs specials lol
[2:34:48] <+SaltySombrero> @fFailureatlife XIV was SNK's first voyage into 3D.
[2:34:55] <rufus2k2> froggy
[2:34:55] <+TopTieramisu> kof 14 was snk getting used to 3d
[2:34:58] <DSD24> Get them ankles
[2:34:58] <krymzen5> i wish this stage was a lil more stage tbh
[2:35:02] <%thetrashman_sc> right, yeah that makes sense
[2:35:05] <+TopTieramisu> SNK hasn't even begun to peak
[2:35:10] <BeijiWeng> I'm pretty sure the last 3d game snk did was probably Samsho 64
[2:35:17] <BeijiWeng> @TopTieramisu True
[2:35:23] <suspence15> Play my favorite blue wolf boy
[2:35:25] <krymzen5> was samsho 64 good?
[2:35:28] <+SaltySombrero> no
[2:35:29] <BeijiWeng> Nope
[2:35:31] <DSD24> I might play Jubei he looks so cool
[2:35:33] <+TopTieramisu> it had shiki
[2:35:34] <$Mighty_observer> no
[2:35:35] <+TopTieramisu> so there's that
[2:35:35] <krymzen5> LUL Oh

[2:35:52] <+ChrisAlgoo> this is making me want to watch champloo again
[2:35:59] <+solzan2000> ouch
[2:35:59] <BeijiWeng> all the other games were made by second companys
[2:36:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> SS64 is weird. I have not played much of it on emulation to say if it was good or bad though
[2:36:05] <krymzen5> glad its one of the few n64 games i don't own
[2:36:05] <+TopTieramisu> @ChrisAlgoo put Sara in samsho
[2:36:10] <$Mighty_observer> @ChrisAlgoo then you remember the ending
[2:36:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> but from what i saw on Mikado/Kouhatsu streams, it's WEEEEEEEIRD
[2:36:28] <+TopTieramisu> dude, sara from champloo would be so sick
[2:36:52] <+TopTieramisu> pelting you with rocks or using her rock cutting slashes
[2:36:57] <$Mighty_observer> I miss yoshimitsu

[2:47:23] <+TopTieramisu> just like haohmaru's is miyamoto musashi
[2:47:32] <%thetrashman_sc> Strike a pose
[2:47:38] <Man_in_the_Red> @fireking900 last round of the last match of the set
[2:47:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> WE'RE CHILDREN WE'RE CHILDREN
[2:47:41] <+SaltySombrero> use darli's command grab
[2:47:56] <MainManJonadiah> Never jump
[2:48:06] <+TopTieramisu> baited
[2:48:10] <pavramz> @TopTieramisu wait isnt jubei also musashi?
[2:48:17] <$Mighty_observer> now i could either dodge the iron claw, or take it in the face and roll around dying
[2:48:22] <DSD24> I hope Ukyo does a Swallow Reversal
[2:48:26] <rufus2k2> Darli's design gives me echoes of Ayla from Chrono Trigger for some reason..
[2:48:27] <+TopTieramisu> @pavramz i definitely know haohmaru is musashi
[2:48:29] <+SaltySombrero> Issen is a good anti-air btw
[2:48:39] <GoldeNOVA> Iaijutsu is super cool but there's something about Ukyo that I don't quite like
[2:48:40] <+TopTieramisu> jubei doesn't really come across like musashi
[2:48:40] <Triplicat> TSUBAME GAESHI
[2:48:43] <rufus2k2> that zero frame
[2:48:45] <+linkwolf4> lytGULP
[2:48:45] <+Spider1991> nice
[2:48:47] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 dats... racist?
[2:48:47] <pavramz> hmmmm
[2:48:50] <President_valentine> is so dirty
[2:48:51] <KalmVibrations> Yagyu Jubei is probably just inspired by himself since he's a real guy
[2:49:00] <DSD24> Lets Go Lets Go
[2:49:04] <%Solidnick18> this game is H O T
[2:49:06] <pavramz> ok
[2:49:09] <Triplicat> there is no grounded tsubame is there
[2:49:14] <+solzan2000> thats the most lethal overhead
[2:49:14] <BusterRepukken> Hows the netcode for this game gonna be
[2:49:15] <@akuda_bar> did ukyo just stash a snack in his kimono
[2:49:18] <Triplicat> you have to either TK it or backdash?
[2:49:19] <BackwardCap> They got the game? How do I get the game?
[2:49:20] <$Mighty_observer> @Solidnick18 like ice cream
[2:49:25] <DSD24> @akuda_bar Yeah his apples
[2:49:28] <BusterRepukken> I hope the netcode will be good
[2:49:29] <+SaltySombrero> tsubame gaeshi is air only
[2:49:34] <%Solidnick18> Melting bars yee
[2:49:34] <President_valentine> you can backdash and do it
[2:49:36] <+TopTieramisu> @BackwardCap become a twitch influencer OpieOP
[2:49:38] <@akuda_bar> do the apples keep the doctor away
[2:49:50] <MainManJonadiah> @BackwardCap You wait a week, like the rest of us savages
[2:49:59] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:50:02] <rufus2k2> @CerberusDriver them tackling the input lag so early and so viciously gives me hope
[2:50:07] <$Mighty_observer> @akuda_bar apperently not, but it gives you cool practice
[2:50:10] <LiquidBinge> do a shot of water
[2:50:13] <Man_in_the_Red> @akuda_bar yes, thats why he has tubercolosis for 20 years
[2:50:16] <BusterRepukken> hopefully its like MK 11 netcode.
[2:50:22] <experimilk> i think it's been patched
[2:50:25] <fireking900> Woolie vs Woolie in a Fem Woolie mirror
[2:50:29] <President_valentine> Do the super
[2:50:30] <MainManJonadiah> Ukyo looks pretty nice
[2:50:31] <experimilk> don't get your hopes up for mk11 netcode
[2:50:32] <BackwardCap> Hmm, how do I become an influencer in less than a week OWLWinston
[2:50:39] <Triplicat> LOL this guy
[2:50:39] <experimilk> it took years and a devoted AAA team to do mk11 netcode
[2:50:42] <Thunderhog> Woolie with the street fighter 4 instincts
[2:50:55] <$Mighty_observer> Darli vs Tam is the TRUE Woolie vs Woolie
[2:50:57] <eldragon_1> Raw super
[2:50:58] <Triplicat> "but if I punish with H I can't cancel out of it" even though raw H is like 30%
[2:51:02] <+Rabbitmage> Ukyo got the aids
[2:51:07] <+linkwolf4> I can already see it: Darli mirror, Gentleman's agreement to put down weapons and PUNCH IT OUT.
[2:51:26] <rufus2k2> those weapon block sounds are clean
[2:51:34] <%Solidnick18> WOOLIE

[2:56:45] <DSD24> @GoldeNOVA Nightmare in Samsho would be rad
[2:56:55] <leontaich> As someone new to the series, is it super footsies based?
[2:56:55] <%mr_sups> Imagine if the next SoulCal guest character is a SamSho character
[2:57:01] <+TopTieramisu> with arcsys take on the painterly style in this samsho
[2:57:02] <experimilk> what's footsies

[2:57:10] <@akuda_bar> work the nooch
[2:57:10] <Man_in_the_Red> @toptieramisu thats like putting Mahvel with Yie Ar Kung Fu
[2:57:12] <BoogieDeluxe> I'm new to Samsho, but it seems VERY footsies based, yeah
[2:57:14] <WackyModder84> Somebody give Ukyo a fucking Claratin!
[2:57:18] <experimilk> it's focused on netural, but your SF footsies don't work
[2:57:32] <experimilk> so it can be an entrapping term if you come in with certain assumptions
[2:57:32] <%Toynota10> do these people have magic powers
[2:57:34] <Man_in_the_Red> nono, wait, Karate Champ
[2:57:36] <Saltmeisterr> this game is all about that NOOCH
[2:57:45] <$Mighty_observer> you know who we need in sam sho, FUMA KOTARO
[2:57:49] <PolloSucio_> i really do want corvo in a fighting game
[2:57:50] <+TopTieramisu> @haveswordmuststing mahvel itself has sf characters in it that work. it can pan out
[2:57:57] <krymzen5> i think SF footsies transfer over best tbh
[2:58:01] <DSD24> @pollosucio_ Corvo from Dishonored?
[2:58:03] <experimilk> ehh
[2:58:04] <PolloSucio_> ye
[2:58:09] <experimilk> you're really setting yourself up for disappointment

[2:58:14] <rufus2k2> dat Raphael stabby
[2:58:15] <+linkwolf4> @WackyModder84 claratin don't fix Tuberculosis.

[3:05:24] <MainManJonadiah> "I'm watching other people play day 1 versions of these characters, I think I can make a pretty solid educated guess on how viable this character is."
[3:05:25] <gustavozxd> that was good
[3:05:29] <BeNiceOrGetOutt> does the game have a tutorial mode?
[3:05:32] <$Mighty_observer> just use cell, 16, and goku

[3:06:33] <SuperFightinRobot> What system would you guys suggest getting this for?
[3:06:42] <+solzan2000> ps4
[3:06:43] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 how? the last time i heard about it was when the superbestfriends played it
[3:06:44] <+TopTieramisu> i'm waiting for PC
[3:06:54] <krymzen5> i'd say ps4. it'll probs be the most active
[3:06:57] <+TopTieramisu> though it'll suck
[3:07:00] <+TopTieramisu> waiting
[3:07:11] <WackyModder84> @Mighty_observer then clearly you haven't been paying attention, they just released a new character a couple of months ago, and got MULTIPLE OTHERS on the way. lol
[3:07:12] <+EightFootOctopus> hyper dbz is getting a 5.0 patch soon
[3:07:18] <+jbaker009> yeah they played it back in the super best days but I think it would be fun for them to look at now with a more fighting game mind
[3:07:25] <+HimeHimeMusic> is it me or the fighting in this game slow
[3:07:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:07:27] <Quikanims> I'm still not convinced about Darli's damage, nothing seems to justify how slow and how much recovery her moves have
[3:07:27] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu just but the game twice Kappa
[3:07:29] <+jbaker009> the game is buated
[3:07:35] <+jbaker009> busted
[3:07:36] <Man_in_the_Red> @himehimemusic yes, thats the point
[3:07:38] <%gatorafan> For fighting games this gen is PS4. But if you want SNK to sell ONE MILLION copies also get it on PC later Kappa
[3:07:47] <+solzan2000> lol
[3:07:53] <Thunderhog> YEEEEEEEEAH
[3:07:53] <+TopTieramisu> purple stuff
[3:07:54] <rufus2k2> grog's up!
[3:07:56] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 i hope it actually drops and doesnt get C&D
[3:07:58] <MainManJonadiah> Chug! Chug! Chug!
[3:08:02] <+boosh5> This the PS2 version?
[3:08:04] <Flarepulse> big slurp

[3:08:08] <DSD24> Man she's awesome
[3:08:08] <+jbaker009> characters can teleport out of dps
[3:08:09] <SolGoodguy> all her fucking colors
[3:08:10] <+jetjagger222> PogChamp
[3:08:10] <Zeif00> Darli is so cool
[3:08:11] <SolGoodguy> are woolie bait
[3:08:12] <WackyModder84> @Mighty_observer Bruh. It physically CAN'T get a C&D. It's just MUGEN. lol
[3:08:14] <+linkwolf4> @HimeHimeMusic it's slow, but everything hits like a truck
[3:08:16] <Triplicat> ONE AND DONE
[3:08:17] <gustavozxd> I've never seen that pose
[3:08:17] <+chefhasteeth> SamSho is also gonna be on Stadia if you want to have extra latency chwLaugh @TopTieramisu
[3:08:18] <+solzan2000> lmao
[3:08:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[3:08:20] <+TopTieramisu> we got edgelords
[3:08:21] <coracor> ouch
[3:08:24] <%thetrashman_sc> bruh pls
[3:08:28] <+jbaker009> this game looks dope.tho
[3:08:31] <MainManJonadiah> Can't tell if that was a typo or shade
[3:08:31] <rufus2k2> y'all got JOKES
[3:08:32] <+linkwolf4> lytFILTH
[3:08:33] <Havik0666> cool stuff
[3:08:35] <ECRead> doodStare doodStare doodStare
[3:08:36] <krymzen5> looking at the game at 720 making calls LUL
[3:08:37] <BeijiWeng> I mean it looks like the ps2 version Kappa
[3:08:38] <Omgbasedjay> Meme gai
[3:08:38] <suspence15> My boy GALFORD
[3:08:40] <TigerClaws12> shoot him
[3:08:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> PS2 graphics gags are so last season lol
[3:08:44] <%Blazymaniac> Blazymaniac subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months!
[3:08:45] <%mr_sups> woolieF woolieU
[3:08:45] <+jbaker009> I love footsie games
[3:08:47] <+jetjagger222> doggo time
[3:08:49] <Spirit_NB> Oh ok, must be the PSP version. gotcha
[3:08:51] <gustavozxd> could be a typo LUL
[3:08:51] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> She got Captain Morgan in that barrel BrokeBack
[3:08:52] <Man_in_the_Red> calebY why are we playing a ps2 game
[3:08:57] <Triplicat> this is samurai shodown 64
[3:09:00] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 never say never, it can totally get hit with some copyrigth bullshit
[3:09:00] <Havik0666> can you just play poppy like in the previous sam sho?
[3:09:04] <+EightFootOctopus> samsho V has the ps2 thumbnail that's why lol
[3:09:07] <President_valentine> nope
[3:09:10] <+CrackedPipe457> This looks good, probably pick it up now
[3:09:16] <coracor> if your captain morgan is purple something has gone horribly wrong
[3:09:18] <+jbaker009> this is clearly for the Virtual boy
[3:09:24] <%mr_sups> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[3:09:30] <+TopTieramisu> @chefhasteeth dope. my yomi will be godlike once i get used to that version since i'll be playing the whole round before i see it LUL
[3:09:39] <%shmupdogjoe> Well, grog is not the same thing as rum
[3:09:40] <$Mighty_observer> white people in japan? RUN JAPANES PEOPLE, DONT END UP LIKE AFRICA!
[3:09:40] <WackyModder84> @Mighty_observer No, you don't get it dude. MUGEN is in a legally gray zone. By that logic, they would have to C&D Tens of Thousands of DBZ Fan Characters / Fighting Games on the MUGEN Engine. Which is impossible and impractical too.
[3:09:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> on that tangent, sen was so fucking jank
[3:09:46] <%shmupdogjoe> I don't know what colour grog is supposed to be though
[3:09:47] <krymzen5> This is actually a Jaguar game Kappa
[3:09:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> a bit enjoyable to an extent
[3:09:50] <suspence15> Les dosis, puupy!
[3:09:55] <Thunderhog> Wait, what fighter actually yells out he's doing an overhead?
[3:10:00] <+jetjagger222> for matching service
[3:10:01] <GoldeNOVA> Is this SamSho for the Stadia?
[3:10:05] <gustavozxd> for the Soulja Boy 64
[3:10:07] <Thunderhog> Galford, literally the worst ninja
[3:10:12] <%shmupdogjoe> Only the raddest fighters, @thunderhog
[3:10:16] <%shmupdogjoe> it shows confidence
[3:10:20] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 oooook, hopefully
[3:10:26] <President_valentine> Galford is a weeb what do you expect
[3:10:26] <%gatorafan> @goldenova isn't it coming to the Stadia?
[3:10:27] <+EightFootOctopus> medium poppy should lead to a free hit
[3:10:29] <MainManJonadiah> Now, if he yelled Overhead while doing a low... That's next level
[3:10:49] <Thunderhog> the loudest of mind games
[3:10:49] <+linkwolf4> call out the overhead, to get in their head.
[3:10:49] <%shmupdogjoe> that's straight up cheating
[3:10:51] <zentav> SamSho will be on stadia for some reason
[3:10:56] <Thunderhog> yelling out every move only to do something else
[3:10:57] <%mr_sups> Ohohohoho
[3:10:58] <+TopTieramisu> they need a character with feints that yells feint when he uses them
[3:10:59] <%thetrashman_sc> charlotte op pls nerf
[3:10:59] <+linkwolf4> make him second guess.
[3:11:01] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> I'm so glad I already paid for my pre-order! majinoBaleyjay Still gotta wait a week. NotLikeThis tsbFeels
[3:11:15] <ECRead> doodCrazy PUPPY! doodBenny3
[3:11:24] <rufus2k2> do machine gun dog!
[3:11:32] <Man_in_the_Red> a character that only has voice lines of false frame data
[3:11:34] <+jbaker009> now I gotta decide if I get this 1st or punch planet
[3:11:51] <%shmupdogjoe> When he screams "plus on block!" that means it's actually your turn
[3:12:02] <DSD24> Oh is Punch Planet coming out soon?
[3:12:34] <Man_in_the_Red> Gascoigne
[3:12:54] <+jbaker009> it's on steam
[3:12:59] <%shmupdogjoe> Gask-wang
[3:13:03] <Quikanims> guys help I don't speak crossiant
[3:13:06] <$Mighty_observer> if a real frenchman heard you speaking canadian french, he would slap you all with a silk white glove
[3:13:08] <+TopTieramisu> a character that yells out literally every input his player presses
[3:13:11] <+EightFootOctopus> old galford trick: whiff kick then do command grab. Works with Hanzo, too lol
[3:13:22] <+TopTieramisu> rightleftdownACleft
[3:13:25] <gustavozxd> oh the throw is really slow huh
[3:13:27] <Man_in_the_Red> @mighty_observer you mean a silk white flag calebY
[3:13:43] <eldragon_1> Ohohohoho
[3:13:46] <$Mighty_observer> @haveswordmuststing same thing in emergencies
[3:13:48] <Triplicat> throw is normal speed, throw WHIFF is a billion years
[3:13:49] <%shmupdogjoe> Top Tieramisu, that would be amazing, I'd start doing 1414141414 constantly on defense just to be annoying
[3:13:51] <rufus2k2> poppy with that rekka
[3:14:03] <+boosh5> si papi
[3:14:06] <MainManJonadiah> Would the voice lines cancel each other out, or would they overlap? @TopTieramisu
[3:14:09] <Thunderhog> damn that wiff doh
[3:14:13] <Man_in_the_Red> i thought tighty whighties were for emergancy surrenders
[3:14:13] <+TopTieramisu> @MainMan_Jonadiah yes
[3:14:19] <MainManJonadiah> Perfect
[3:14:21] <Triplicat> enough to punish with raw heavy
[3:14:35] <rufus2k2> destroyed~

[3:15:54] <rufus2k2> YO THAT KICK
[3:15:59] <+EightFootOctopus> there you go
[3:16:11] <rufus2k2> that was some capoeira shit, where'd she learn that?
[3:16:12] <%shmupdogjoe> I feel like a dog is an unfair advantage in a duel
[3:16:19] <JanusII> Cutting someone clean in half with a fencing sabre though. LUL
[3:16:27] <Papafleish> nothing screams samurai fighting game like two white blonds
[3:16:31] <Man_in_the_Red> @rufus2k2 ballet?
[3:16:39] <$Mighty_observer> i feel like lightning powers are unfaie also
[3:16:46] <rufus2k2> @haveswordmuststing I'll believe it
[3:16:56] <+TopTieramisu> @Papafleish have you played last blade? Kappa
[3:17:02] <$Mighty_observer> @Papafleish just the way japan wanted it
[3:17:08] <+EightFootOctopus> don't jump after the enemy activates lol, that's free -80%
[3:17:12] <krymzen5> japans vision
[3:17:15] <+TopTieramisu> the black haired protagonist literally goes super saiyan
[3:17:15] <%shmupdogjoe> Well, if you play it back in slow motion she doesn't really cut you in half with the sabre, she actually more *lathes* you in half. It's pretty horrific
[3:17:40] <CalvinSimsArt> heavy is too slow after a throw
[3:17:44] <Owkono> Gilgamesh would be fun
[3:17:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> ah, last blade. where the protag turns super saiyan and the naginata wielder is blonde
[3:17:51] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> SoonerLater Who let the dog out? OhMyDog
[3:17:56] <+EightFootOctopus> try B into special after throw then
[3:17:58] <Man_in_the_Red> we could use more Yoshitora
[3:17:59] <Quikanims> YEAH OKAY THERE SONICFOX
[3:18:07] <Papafleish> I want the first guest char to be Terminator
[3:18:09] <+jetjagger222> whens earfquake
[3:18:10] <krymzen5> i would still freak out over a last blade rep
[3:18:11] <Quikanims> SIDE SWITCHIN'
[3:18:21] <$Mighty_observer> @Guntanks_in_Space JUST THE WAY JAPAN...
[3:18:36] <+jetjagger222> ANIME
[3:18:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think someone who can land a special off throw is genjuro
[3:18:42] <lefthook11> Let’s hope it raises the fighting games standards from now on !
[3:18:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> like guard break, crouch A into A Rekka

[3:31:16] <+EightFootOctopus> you get your super duper once per match
[3:31:21] <+pooglywoogly> Super Special Move is one time per match. Can't use it in another round.
[3:31:30] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu well it was shiki vs Tam Tam, and lets just say... Tam hungry
[3:31:42] <+pooglywoogly> Weapon Flipping Tehcnique is the one that's repeatable as long as you have full rage meter.

[3:32:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> no OTGs i mean
[3:32:39] <Triplicat> no pursuits
[3:32:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> and pursuit ain't here yeah

[3:33:18] <+TopTieramisu> i want to be a shiki main when it comes out but i feel like i'll end up a jubei player
[3:33:38] <$SilverRoddo> Reggie Gunboy
[3:33:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> i wanna learn wu, but my heart calls for Genjuro, Ukyo or Yoshitora (my old stand-bys)
[3:33:39] <President_valentine> It's either Ukyo or Jubei for me
[3:33:52] <$Mighty_observer> jubei is sword guile
[3:33:57] <President_valentine> mayber Shiki
[3:33:58] <+EightFootOctopus> everyone but nak looks fun to me lol
[3:34:13] <MainManJonadiah> I want to play every character except like 2 (Charlotte and Rux)
[3:34:21] <+TopTieramisu> @EightFootOctopus even rimururu? Kappa
[3:34:27] <Triplicat> just 5H
[3:34:30] <+EightFootOctopus> yeah
[3:34:41] <$Mighty_observer> ......
[3:34:53] <+EightFootOctopus> Irohas will be catching these hands though, they're on sight
[3:34:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> So we are looking at combos of like 3 or 4 individual inputs max, huh?
[3:35:12] <$SilverRoddo> Do any streamers have cameras mounted on their controllers? Like the way guitar players have cams on the head of their instruments?
[3:35:13] <Triplicat> who in the game has a DP that can't be punished by 5H on whiff
[3:35:28] <$SilverRoddo> I feel that would be a good gimmick.
[3:35:31] <Triplicat> that would surprise me extremely
[3:35:34] <%shmupdogjoe> I don't think that's a thing in this game
[3:35:47] <lordreginald> 1 or 2 with the exception of the occasional rekka
[3:35:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:36:11] <Man_in_the_Red> this games got the most nooch
[3:36:16] <MainManJonadiah> Opening with heavies looks so nice!
[3:36:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> some people do that for music games @SilverRoddo , and some retro players have input display overlays i think
[3:36:37] <brokenroberto> is the dodge/side step mechanic even worth it? @woolieversus
[3:36:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> or the DMC CMV dudes who have inputs show up on their webcam
[3:37:03] <$Mighty_observer> its a yomi
[3:37:10] <$SilverRoddo> Nice, i’ll have to look out for them, thank you.
[3:37:14] <Man_in_the_Red> character stops existing for a short window
[3:37:30] <+Spider1991> I believe that it even avoids issen if timed correctly
[3:37:30] <nmeira> How do you cut up people after the round?
[3:37:36] <+boosh5> Does it have the old clash and mash?
[3:37:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea @Spider1991 i think it does
[3:37:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> @boosh5 yeah clash mash is there
[3:37:49] <+boosh5> nice
[3:37:50] <$Mighty_observer> unarmed jubei runs like a anime
[3:37:56] <Man_in_the_Red> @boosh5 and it actually works
[3:37:58] <+EightFootOctopus> sometimes try dashing under them too for anti air
[3:38:00] <brokenroberto> ok, I haven't seen it used well yet. :)
[3:38:17] <+ameer000> Does this game feel similar to that granblue fighting game in terms of neutral?
[3:38:23] <$Mighty_observer> nooooooooooooooooo

[3:43:46] <Man_in_the_Red> @dsd24 well, theres the one 1000 year old but not much
[3:43:46] <$Mighty_observer> is this stage Granada?
[3:44:04] <+Lord0Mugen> Kenshin is pretty great until after the Shishio Arc. then it just kinda has nowhere to go. especially since they didnt use the final arc of the manga
[3:44:12] <%shmupdogjoe> ^
[3:44:15] <+TopTieramisu> @Mighty_observer japanese media loves hattori hanzo and masamune and that red flower that's in nioh

[3:44:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @DSD24 I think he just equates Grenada with the frumpy, unfun part of his life, It's like your parent's getting into something you thought was unique and differentiated you from them
[3:44:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> just say fuck it and do it again
[3:44:51] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu dont forget the true Emperor of Japan, Oda Nobunaga

[3:45:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> JUST START THE ROUND WITH IT
[3:45:41] <%jinking79> So Woolie won that match
[3:45:52] <MainManJonadiah> Woolie's in his head now
[3:45:53] <Triplicat> he can't, she needs to put the sword down first
[3:46:00] <+Lord0Mugen> That Crossup is fucking dumb
[3:46:02] <+Lord0Mugen> just sayin
[3:46:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Not gonna lie, Darli is Hype as fuck
[3:46:20] <$Mighty_observer> ^ it is

[3:46:56] <+TopTieramisu> yeah
[3:46:57] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> @Mighty_observer Yeah. Hattori Hanzo was a real life ninja. Japanese made many shows and movies about him.
[3:47:07] <MainManJonadiah> He played a match against Reggie earlier where he tried to land it the ENTIRE round
[3:47:17] <+TopTieramisu> iori's stanky leg that also can give him a super backdash
[3:47:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It is kinda like the Haitian revolt of 1804
[3:47:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> start the round off with galatica phantom
[3:47:33] <+Lord0Mugen> eeeeww
[3:47:37] <+Lord0Mugen> the minus frames
[3:47:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm gonna keep giving bad advice
[3:47:50] <$Mighty_observer> @Diam0nd_Dawg278 i know, but i only se him in like every video game ever, not any movies or shows
[3:47:50] <President_valentine> try it with a back throw
[3:47:52] <$SilverRoddo> Darlingtonette?
[3:48:09] <RadShiro> Shes got the OJUO SAMA LAUGH?! PogChamp
[3:48:10] <+Lord0Mugen> Woolie going too HAM with this girl

[3:48:30] <+Lord0Mugen> wut?
[3:48:40] <rufus2k2> what was that!
[3:48:40] <MainManJonadiah> Was that a command grab?
[3:48:41] <+TopTieramisu> yo, she's got the dragunov slide
[3:48:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> START IT OFF WITH GALATICA PHANTOM DAMNIT
[3:48:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> PJsalt
[3:48:55] <+Lord0Mugen> I think the one thing people arent going to like about this is how COMMITTED you have to be to every action.
[3:48:57] <%mr_sups> Thank the people?
[3:49:01] <MainManJonadiah> That look Jimmy gave
[3:49:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> no you don't
[3:49:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> online logic works until it doesn't
