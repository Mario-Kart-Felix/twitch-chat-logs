[0:07:14] <Wh0mpson> What an opener
[0:07:14] <%Josef_Stryker> So is GTA5 just Rockstar's Skyrim?

[0:08:30] <+gustavozxd> 6 or 7
[0:08:33] <CazadorDeWulf> This is looking like ResidentSleeper
[0:08:37] <@Menitta> Remember when they turned down GTA4 exclusive to the PS3
[0:08:41] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus time since red dead 2 is the relevant factor
[0:08:50] <Mrthefro> As long as 5 prints money, then no.
[0:08:52] <andrei11dr> But would've played aa black caracter in any setting, but it just happened that CJ was the first one
[0:08:53] <CakeTitties> they literally just started development
[0:08:55] <%NickHatesSnow> There was no new GTA this generation
[0:08:55] <CozyGUNNA> gta 6 not happening for a minute
[0:08:58] <deadbeatpete> yo yo
[0:08:59] <%RioGascar> Gta6 never until gta5 dies
[0:09:01] <%Javaa01> They could, or they could keep milking 5 forever
[0:09:14] <+gustavozxd> infamous?
[0:09:16] <%Valask> what?
[0:09:16] <DatAsuna> Heck rockstar released just one game
[0:09:19] <@Menitta> Meanwhile there were two last gen and three during the ps2

[0:17:13] <CozyGUNNA> LUL LUL LUL
[0:17:13] <ToxInjection> I didn't tune in at first because I thought it was just a preshow for tomorrow. Has it been worthwhile so far?
[0:17:14] <1v1GE> maybe turn rtx off?
[0:17:14] <+Standard_Enemy> This gameplay looks great
[0:17:15] <+gustavozxd> the game definitely looks pretty
[0:17:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> Reggie is the dude who was constantly popping off during the bethesda conference
[0:17:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I miss the times when everything was new
[0:17:27] <@Solidus_113> Look at those totally not loading portals
[0:17:29] <Teras_ode> like woolie has any room to point fingers LUL
[0:17:34] <CirclesForever> is this jack and daxter
[0:17:37] <CozyGUNNA> @fuqboislim LUL LUL LUL
[0:17:44] <Haarute> woolie subscribed to reggie's reaction channel
[0:17:46] <andrei11dr> The Bethesda "WOOO" guy was Reggie all along
[0:17:48] <lotharrio> Anyway, I showed up late. I saw a driving game, and this. I miss anything cool?
[0:17:48] <jorniev> gameplay?
[0:17:49] <@Menitta> If this is a launch title, I'll def grab it
[0:17:53] <CazadorDeWulf> This is like, too hard for kids, and too easy/cartoonish for adults
[0:17:56] <0rond> how do you like the opinated alt ratchet?
[0:18:00] <+MinovskyPhysics> It's probably going to be more fun hanging out and watching this event, than actually playing the games being showcased
[0:18:02] <DatAsuna> Usually the subtitle is dirtier though
[0:18:03] <@Menitta> 3D Platformers are fun
[0:18:06] <jorniev> holy shit actual gameplay
[0:18:11] <DatAsuna> Rift apart kinda lacking the double entendre
[0:18:12] <+BNPhone> nothing aside from new spiderman @lotharrio
[0:18:12] <%RioGascar> Ratchet was usually marketed at teens
[0:18:15] <%BisoromiBear> za hando
[0:18:21] <ToxInjection> The game sure looks pretty.
[0:18:26] <%Valask> the thing is Woolie is usually told that something is cool lime 6 years after it's out
[0:18:26] <Aussie_Manny> I've played this game before. Several times, honestly.
[0:18:29] <%Livelinne> Awww🥰
[0:18:36] <%GrassCannon> woolieReggieChamp

[0:18:47] <Teras_ode> the fucking name again UL
[0:18:49] <@Menitta> Although Spyro is great
[0:18:54] <MKII> ratchet will get in dat rift
[0:18:55] <0rond> weird that they didn't call it "ripped apart", seems like it retains the feeling and meaning while keeping it a double entendre
[0:18:56] <yash_lawman> That looked good.
[0:19:05] <+MinovskyPhysics> So far we seem to have seen actualy gameplay as much as pre-rendered video.
[0:19:06] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god
[0:19:08] <+gustavozxd> oh

[0:36:34] <+LordPhol> platforming lemmings, basically
[0:36:34] <lotharrio> Oh there we go
[0:36:35] <@Menitta> One thing that's not blowing me away is how none of the games shown look like a massive jump from the PS4
[0:36:37] <Tha_Mik> Because it is

[1:20:11] <RodCU> FGC edition, No Wifi
[1:20:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why the fuck would you have a digital only with no ethernet?!
[1:20:15] <+jiggy_snipe> but imagine you would need a disk drive for backwards compatibility
[1:20:16] <%Javaa01> Xbone SAD was 50 cheaper without the disk drive
[1:20:17] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> That moment when a ps3 game was the highlight of your new console calebKW calebKW calebKW calebKW calebKW calebKW

[1:21:00] <+Yamigetsu> @legendarydorkknight >battery powered controllers in 2020
[1:21:00] <RichochetForce> I just realized both consoles look like evil headquarters.

[1:21:24] <jorniev> the consola has a popped collar
[1:21:32] <+gustavozxd> "kiddie games"

[1:21:47] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus whaddya wanna bet they just wait for the xbox price then immediately counterprice?
[1:21:49] <CazadorDeWulf> They showed headphones. Is that extra add-on or included, I wonder
[1:21:49] <sumo_cheesey_boi_san> that one japanese game looked good
[1:21:50] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus twich just shows trojan commercials when I watch woolie stream.
[1:21:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> PS5 reminds me of those iDog and iCat toys
[1:21:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Charging dock is good
[1:21:57] <nabs2099> can't wait to buy the PS5 pro in 2 years
[1:21:59] <%nepwar> can't wait to buy ps5 when i live somewhere the white console doesn't look like shit in 5 days
[1:21:59] <Uninterestedd> New Xbox is definitely my aesthetic
[1:22:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> Can't Wait to buy a PS5.....emulator
[1:22:07] <RichochetForce> @Uninterestedd Your aesthetic is a box?
[1:22:09] <%tokenreefer> 1000 usd for everything lol
[1:22:13] <Uninterestedd> yep
[1:22:29] <voodoolawyer> One USB port ... hmmm
[1:22:32] <+TehBeerBaron> Media remote
[1:22:34] <+TheotherKristian> When will Publishers realize all we want are 5-15 minute demo walkthroughs
[1:22:34] <RichochetForce> @Uninterestedd Alright, different strokes for different folks.
[1:22:36] <CazadorDeWulf> Is that a vibrator
[1:22:36] <%gatorafan> Oh god, the Redfield bloodline memes are resurfacing...
[1:22:37] <%SuperKirby24> just got in, what're woolies thoughts on the whole thing
[1:22:44] <DatAsuna> not okay
[1:22:46] <Uninterestedd> minimal and streamlined
[1:22:46] <%nepwar> if only
[1:22:46] <OriginalLurker> $800 us? you crazy
[1:22:46] <%RioGascar> Why a media remote
[1:22:47] <RichochetForce> @TheotherKristian Stop speaking for everyone. That would be dull as shit.
[1:22:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> With two consols
[1:22:49] <dinnydanny777> 800 Is way too much
[1:22:50] <+Freddy_Millz> $699
[1:22:51] <+vexicbayn> the media remote is a silly idea currently
[1:22:55] <+BubbaRands> nope
[1:22:56] <%gatorafan> Chrisposting is coming back!
[1:22:56] <%ChoculaUltra> but why white tho
[1:22:58] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[1:23:00] <+VermillonMars> there was a shot of it on its side
[1:23:01] <CazadorDeWulf> Media remote is for blueray
[1:23:03] <%tokenreefer> that thing would look so ugly in my entertainment system
[1:23:04] <dinnydanny777> We're in a great depression
[1:23:05] <DatAsuna> no fuckin' way I'd pay 800 for that
[1:23:07] <CazadorDeWulf> bluray*
[1:23:08] <%SuperKirby24> HD camera again NotLikeThis
[1:23:10] <%Javaa01> That charging dock will absolutely be 45$
[1:23:11] <gag5y> "technically" the switch
[1:23:13] <Teras_ode> giff 70 for second controller plz :)
[1:23:18] <%RioGascar> Why do i need a media remote the ps5 controller will work fine
[1:23:21] <nothuzad> the white contains teh original black of the playstation SeriousSloth
[1:23:22] <dadeaner> you're not getting that black stand either
[1:23:22] <%ChoculaUltra> y'all remember the og foreman grill ps3?
[1:23:22] <sileo_patronus> I could see it coming with the remote but not the rest
[1:23:24] <+TheotherKristian> @richochetforce I'm so bored with gameplay trailers, my dude
[1:23:24] <Uninterestedd> I don't want a spaceship on my shelf but I know I'll get it anyway though...
[1:23:27] <knowyourenemy_97> DEMON SOULS REMASTER IS REAL!!!!!!
[1:23:28] <sexdrugsvideogames> PS5 I'm so hype guys!
[1:23:28] <voodoolawyer> Does anyone actually like how it looks? This console has the techno organic virus n shit
[1:23:28] <%ChoculaUltra> this is that but 2020
[1:23:29] <CazadorDeWulf> Those headphones don't look adjustable wtf
[1:23:29] <aigriot970> i never buy a console on debut anyway
[1:23:35] <%The_Timo> I think they're going with White because Xbox and Nintendo left it behind and they wanted to stand out lol
[1:23:35] <+TheotherKristian> "gameplay"
[1:23:35] <%RioGascar> Hit play, hit pause, rewind and fast forward with triggers
[1:23:35] <EynosStyles> Your paying for the experience! fuk
[1:23:36] <andrei11dr> I wish there's a none white variant
[1:23:37] <+huggablemantooth> where did the figure $800 come from
[1:23:40] <Aussie_Manny> PlayStation Alienware.
[1:23:40] <+vexicbayn> okay why do you need a remote for bluray when your phone or standard controller does all that
[1:23:47] <sexdrugsvideogames> of course I can't afford it bat hey
[1:23:48] <dinnydanny777> If you want to play your old games without buying them you'll have to buy the disc version which I'm guessing will be a lot more expensive
[1:23:50] <+gustavozxd> i'm more interested in the games tbh
[1:23:52] <Aussie_Manny> It's fuckin' Alienware.
[1:23:53] <+sammyisa> What's that tv controller looking thing?
[1:23:56] <+gustavozxd> and the controller I guess
[1:23:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> $50 controllers + $100 camera + headset/remote $100 + $500 console could probably be $700-$800
[1:24:00] <RichochetForce> @TheotherKristian And I'm bored of textbook dry gameplay demonstrations with painfully slow, unrepresentative combat with dull commentary.
[1:24:01] <fuji_92> shitty design is shitty
[1:24:04] <CazadorDeWulf> It's shaped like this from the front to look like a V for 5 get it guis
[1:24:06] <@Solidus_113> Here's the PS5 on it's side https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/276054105779339265/720748956447146094/image0.png
[1:24:06] <TeethMuncher> Wait, so one usb port?
[1:24:07] <%RioGascar> It looks cheap bootleg tho honestly
[1:24:08] <Wh0mpson> Seriously what the fuck, ONE standard usb port
[1:24:09] <+TehBeerBaron> @WoolieVersus You CAN put it on it's side
[1:24:09] <+ledgefiendd> did the event just happen?
[1:24:11] <voodoolawyer> >$50 controllers LUL
[1:24:11] <PantsSoldSeparately> I hate the disc one but I live in Australia so fuck me how viable is digital only
[1:24:12] <+Yamigetsu> @sammyisa a media remote
[1:24:12] <+BNPhone> 3 and a half so about 24 inches
[1:24:14] <RichochetForce> Press already said the controller is slightly larger than DS4.
[1:24:14] <Solidnick18> ps4 weighs pretty heavy
[1:24:18] <%tokenreefer> why do i need that many curves on my TV stand
[1:24:18] <voodoolawyer> no way bro these controllers are gonna be 80 a poop
[1:24:18] <+BNPhone> 2 and a half i mean
[1:24:19] <andrei11dr> Again, hopefully it takes more than 1 fall
[1:24:20] <voodoolawyer> *a pop
[1:24:20] <dinnydanny777> I am betting that the disc version exists so they can charge an extra 100
[1:24:22] <Aussie_Manny> $100 controllers.
[1:24:23] <olaksi> Omg, an SSD, the thing that's standard on a low-end laptop
[1:24:27] <DatAsuna> Heaviest is original xbone
[1:24:27] <Teras_ode> wait, ONE usb ????? LUL
[1:24:28] <RichochetForce> DS4
[1:24:32] <%Ecchigun> woolieFUN woolieGLORY woolieGIRLS
[1:24:35] <CazadorDeWulf> Xbox original was heaviest
[1:24:36] <CazadorDeWulf> bet
[1:24:39] <dinnydanny777> Cause if you buy digital you have to rebuy all your old games
[1:24:40] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, the white collar bits make me think that this thing would absolutely be fucked on a bad drop
[1:24:41] <%nepwar> the pros not that heavy. this looks like slim light
[1:24:43] <smanana998> I hope they don't force the headphones and remote just to pick up the price
[1:24:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> THICC GIRl
[1:24:45] <blackkanye> Damn boi he thicc
[1:24:45] <RichochetForce> PS3 Phat was ridiculous
[1:24:47] <Tha_Mik> Man I want a ps3
[1:24:48] <sexdrugsvideogames> its prolly $500 for disc version, $400 for digi only?
[1:24:54] <Wh0mpson> One normal usb and one type c by the looks of it
[1:24:58] <%Ecchigun> xbox original had a low failure rate
[1:24:59] <DatAsuna> wanna bet the fans die in the first year again?
[1:25:04] <voodoolawyer> This Dracula lookin' ass console.
[1:25:13] <CirclesForever> phat
[1:25:15] <Winner_92> you guys should look at it on its side
[1:25:16] <%SuperKirby24> GOTTA GET PHAT
[1:25:16] <voodoolawyer> Popped Collar ass console
[1:25:18] <Solidnick18> that things gonna overheat like crazy
[1:25:19] <%gatorafan> THICC
[1:25:21] <OriginalLurker> ps5 pro gonna be slim
[1:25:24] <+TehBeerBaron> The disc tray looks like a tumor
[1:25:29] <smanana998> why the curve
[1:25:31] <+BubbaRands> Gimmie dat T H I C C S Y S T E M
[1:25:32] <+TheotherKristian> I'll probably be using the disc trat solely for my previous generation games
[1:25:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985

[1:25:36] <+gustavozxd> RE8 THOUGH
[1:25:36] <Solidnick18> it's a remake
[1:25:37] <%tokenreefer> demon souls the only game thats going to sell this console

[1:25:45] <+VoytekBus> bugsnax though
[1:25:45] <%ekodrop> spiderman?
[1:25:46] <siamzero94> probably nothing right now

[1:25:56] <%RioGascar> its not really woolie
[1:25:57] <+GingerStrawhat> Ghost Wire?
[1:25:58] <+krispen_wa> DEMON SOULS
[1:26:00] <DDDorsett> HD TRIAL MOUNTAIN
[1:26:00] <%ChoculaUltra> woolie's audio sounds like its being recorded underwater
[1:26:02] <%gatorafan> Miles didn't mater? D:
[1:26:03] <musti_jaja_> solar aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssshhhhh
[1:26:06] <+kaiju7544> No Street Fighter 6
[1:26:06] <%ekodrop> it's bluepoint
[1:26:06] <nepwar> Bluepoint doing it is sick
[1:26:07] <Solidnick18> ghost wire was alright
[1:26:07] <WakeUpThrow> Ghoost Wire looked sick
[1:26:08] <RichochetForce> Horizon is the best next gen showcase thus far.
[1:26:09] <sexdrugsvideogames> demon souls, spider man, resi vii, tokyo ghost...
[1:26:09] <fuji_92> Fuck all that DEMON SOULS
[1:26:10] <%RioGascar> demon souls is actually who cares you already got your game
[1:26:11] <+gustavozxd> there was some wild shit man
[1:26:16] <%ekodrop> so SoC
[1:26:17] <%SuperKirby24> ghost wire looked pretty vool
[1:26:18] <arkv01> miles is cool BUT DEMONZ
[1:26:18] <%gatorafan> I'm sure Horizon is big too, I just don't care about it
[1:26:20] <olaksi> Demon's Souls remaster is only "important" because nostalgia
[1:26:24] <%therealtacopancakes> So what was the dead space teaser?
[1:26:25] <CazadorDeWulf> ReMAKE??!?
[1:26:27] <+gustavozxd> new capcom game, RE8, spiderman, new arkane game, i'm hyped
[1:26:29] <Mrthefro> Yea, audio's been spotty the whole stream
[1:26:31] <+jiggy_snipe> yea that looked way different than the OG
[1:26:36] <CazadorDeWulf> Is it remake or remaster!?
[1:26:38] <%AlteisenReiseZ> CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT HAVING ONLY ONE USB PORT ON THE FRONT? WHAT ABOUT PLUGGING IN STICKS?
[1:26:41] <%nepwar> horizon is cool so ill play that when it comes
[1:26:44] <RichochetForce> Pragmata is apparently Capcom's next big action game according to leaks
[1:26:48] <RichochetForce> That name popped up a few months ago
[1:26:50] <+donevan42> if bluepoint did demon souls, does that mean no bloodborne?
[1:26:52] <arkv01> holy shit this is their first new project since SOTC
[1:26:56] <+jiggy_snipe> I assume remake with all those scenes
[1:26:58] <+artyom47> the RTX Voice doesnt sound good whenever the voices get loud. it warps everything
[1:27:02] <+Freddy_Millz> @AlteisenReiseZ wireless
[1:27:02] <+BNPhone> usb and usb-c
[1:27:02] <OriginalLurker> usb and usbc
[1:27:04] <%Javaa01> One USB A and one USB C
[1:27:04] <RichochetForce> USB-A and USB C
[1:27:06] <musti_jaja_> one USB A and one USB C yeah
[1:27:09] <Teras_ode> usb and c-port
[1:27:11] <%RioGascar> @alteisenreisez Sonys kinda made their point already clear when not a single fighting game was even shown at this presentation
[1:27:14] <+Mohanoman> PS5 Coping the 4th Hokage's Jacket
[1:27:16] <andrei11dr> Too be fair, if not for the jank ,Demons would be my favorite souls game, so that's why im so hype
[1:27:18] <asd2897> usb a and a usb c, rip tounaments
[1:27:19] <%tokenreefer> USBC... theres probably going to be one in the back
[1:27:25] <RichochetForce> @RioGascar Fighting games are extremely niche.
[1:27:27] <musti_jaja_> maybe the controller's cable is C to C
[1:27:29] <sexdrugsvideogames> was hoping for tekken the whole time
[1:27:29] <%nepwar> solidus posted a side image that is zommed in @WoolieVersus
[1:27:32] <olaksi> Retreading ground the entire Dark Souls series already retread
[1:27:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Wireless sticks? Eww.
[1:27:46] <voodoolawyer> I wanted to see them just say "Oh yeah, KI is gonna be on this too." That woulda been enough.
[1:27:50] <RichochetForce> @RioGascar Let me know what fighting game developer has the money, budget, and talent ready to pump out a next gen game.
[1:27:57] <Mrthefro> I never played Demon souls. Very hyped
[1:27:57] <Solidnick18> huh
[1:28:03] <voodoolawyer> @RichochetForce Netherrealm
[1:28:03] <siamzero94> there has to be backside ports
[1:28:03] <Solidnick18> oh
[1:28:05] <OriginalLurker> usb hub accessory for fighting games
[1:28:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @RichochetForce If anythingm Netherrealm
[1:28:07] <+jiggy_snipe> weird
[1:28:08] <%RioGascar> @richochetforce ...arksys?
[1:28:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> tekken is a playstation mainstay tho
[1:28:13] <+jiggy_snipe> gonna need a hub
[1:28:15] <%ekodrop> i wish the disk drive was in the middle
[1:28:15] <%nepwar> wheres the power button
[1:28:15] <arkv01> you get TWO for the price of one ps5!!!
[1:28:21] <%RioGascar> also tekken
[1:28:22] <+Freddy_Millz> there is another on the top
[1:28:26] <Prevot> ruh roh
[1:28:26] <%Javaa01> Get your dongles out
[1:28:28] <sexdrugsvideogames> maybe on the back?
[1:28:29] <CazadorDeWulf> Imagine that being a thunderbolt 3 port and you can use an e-gpu
[1:28:31] <%tokenreefer> if theres a camera there will be a port in the back
[1:28:31] <Dalonomus> They never think about this
[1:28:31] <%ChoculaUltra> rip fighters
[1:28:34] <RichochetForce> @voodoolawyer Yeah, they're probably working on something. Almost every other fighting game dev is POVERTY tier. They take a long time to take advantage of next gen hardware.
[1:28:35] <%SuperKirby24> bluetooth fightsticks 4Head

[1:28:59] <@Menitta> https://i.imgur.com/g75KnIv.png
[1:29:02] <sexdrugsvideogames> @voodoolawyer yeah...!
[1:29:04] <stevo_scar> Aracad sticks don't have bluetooth?
[1:29:05] <RichochetForce> @GueyDuckB Dongle Life
[1:29:17] <%RioGascar> might just have to get usb hubs
[1:29:18] <%tokenreefer> if theres a camera there will be a port in the back for sure
[1:29:20] <wendisky> Lag on Bluetooth tho
[1:29:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can put it on it's side
[1:29:22] <Dalonomus> @stevo_scar nope why would they
[1:29:23] <@Menitta> The stand is used for the side as well
[1:29:24] <DatAsuna> Whaddya wanna bet that the Square enix games goes away like deep down did?
[1:29:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> it just looks more stupid
[1:29:29] <Tha_Mik> Looks so weird
[1:29:32] <+wydamn> that's gotta be a usb c
[1:29:38] <%ChoculaUltra> the disk tray on the bottom tho? that looks even funkier horizontal
[1:29:40] <sexdrugsvideogames> show the pic please
[1:29:42] <%The_Timo> Yeah I was saying that, there's a stand for it
[1:29:46] <+wydamn> I think it's the same stand
[1:29:48] <stevo_scar> @Dalonomus Wouldn't see a reason why they couldnt'
[1:29:54] <%SuperKirby24> it looks like a dust magnet ngl
[1:29:54] <%nepwar> unless its just for show, it looks like stand is needed for both ways
[1:29:58] <+wydamn> like the wii's stand, can work vertical and horizontal
[1:30:03] <sileo_patronus> Looks like the stand just comes off and snaps on the side
[1:30:03] <CazadorDeWulf> That is in fact a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port
[1:30:03] <snakesonabane> SPEEN
[1:30:04] <%The_Timo> It was in a few Shots in the show but glances
[1:30:06] <%Iwashi94> speeeEEEEeeeeEEEN
[1:30:14] <OriginalLurker> bluetooth fight sticks incoming $299
[1:30:14] <%SuperKirby24> speEEEEEeeeNNNN
[1:30:15] <mistersups> It looks like it's giving a cheeky grin.
[1:30:15] <CazadorDeWulf> I just looked, it may support external GPUs
[1:30:15] <sturner202> 360
[1:30:16] <OldManDeckardCain> why does the ps5 look like my wifi LUL
[1:30:16] <+BNPhone> 360 kills disks
[1:30:18] <%nepwar> 360
[1:30:20] <DatAsuna> it was 360
[1:30:20] <Axle13j> 360 couldn't move lol
[1:30:22] <Winner_92> the ps5 somehow looks worse on its side i think
[1:30:22] <asd2897> 360 had the issue
[1:30:23] <exileshadow03> PS5 console design has a similar aesthetic to those fake Chinese android consoles
[1:30:25] <+thatfguy> thatfguy subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:30:26] <%SuperKirby24> 360 LUL
[1:30:28] <RichochetForce> @OldManDeckardCain Surprise, you have the PS5 already!
[1:30:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> HAAAAAA
[1:30:31] <%Amardeux> you can spin it like a top
[1:30:32] <%GueyDuckB> 360 kills discs
[1:30:33] <+tonyboso> Gonna be honest, the PS5 looks horrible. What were they thinking?
[1:30:33] <DatAsuna> 360 would scratch it if moved while turned on
[1:30:34] <OldManDeckardCain> nice
[1:30:35] <voodoolawyer> @WoolieVersus Lazy Susan
[1:30:37] <Tha_Mik> Spi n
[1:30:38] <asd2897> lazy susan
[1:30:39] <@Solidus_113> LAZY SUSAN
[1:30:39] <OldManDeckardCain> PogChamp PogChamp
[1:30:44] <DatAsuna> that looks awful on it's side
[1:30:45] <RichochetForce> Lazy Susan tech
[1:30:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> that looks like it's trying to the controller
[1:30:46] <+RadDude6969> SPEEEEEEEEN
[1:30:46] <+sasssyredpanda> it looks broken
[1:30:47] <wendisky> 360 ruined me, never again
[1:30:48] <sexdrugsvideogames> i like the design! it looks like a taco
[1:30:48] <%SuperKirby24> lazy susan LUL
[1:30:48] <Prevot> that's how it loads so fast
[1:30:49] <dukenux> speen
[1:30:52] <+ryujinran> Lazy susan
[1:30:52] <@Menitta> I kinda like it
[1:30:52] <sarg1010> Honestly if there is a stan, it'd be best to have it on that side.
[1:30:54] <%RioGascar> Ps5 honestly looks like a bootleg router
[1:30:54] <+DomunDomunDomun> Spinning is so much cooler than not spinning.
[1:30:54] <+VoytekBus> that's awkward
[1:30:54] <%tokenreefer> woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[1:30:55] <+donevan42> spin to get at those usbs
[1:30:55] <+king_of_beggars> It needs a plate or it wobbles. That's awful.
[1:30:57] <%BisoromiBear> 360 carved rings into games if you breathed on it too hard
[1:30:57] <Augus7717> its looks wrong
[1:30:58] <%Gamefriendly> xbox 360
[1:31:05] <%therealtacopancakes> imma wait for the pro in a couple years
[1:31:08] <+donevan42> would actualy be legit
[1:31:12] <sexdrugsvideogames> it looks like Zaha Hadid
[1:31:14] <DelgotHansto> looks like modern architecture
[1:31:14] <+king_of_beggars> It looks like a pistachio.
[1:31:14] <+gustavozxd> looks goofy but honestly i'm not gonna look at it ever anyway
[1:31:15] <muniea3> looks like a duck bill
[1:31:16] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> 1 USB port == need wireless controllers for 2+ players
[1:31:16] <arkv01> ok cool, theres a horizontal stand
[1:31:19] <HUNTERX2X> a fridge and a router. the perfect house devices
[1:31:19] <+EtheralFlameX> knock off chinese console, I got that thing in 2005 from a crane game
[1:31:20] <RichochetForce> It looks like a building.
[1:31:21] <%nepwar> it looks like the robo gator's head
[1:31:22] <voodoolawyer> The Console actually spins AROUND the disk
[1:31:24] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Vertical stand isn't a risk for discs, with the 360 the problem was moving it while it was on
[1:31:27] <fuji_92> it looks ugly
[1:31:28] <+king_of_beggars> It's a pistachio popping out of the shell.
[1:31:32] <randomguy722> at first I disliked the new control but now it's justified, this design is so fucking sexy
[1:31:34] <sarg1010> I wonder if that ps3 grill is still working
[1:31:35] <Winner_92> the ps5 looks like a half opened clam
[1:31:35] <%Gamefriendly> ps5 turntable dem discs LUL
[1:31:36] <muniea3> Howard the Console
[1:31:36] <@Menitta> It looks like a product that'd exist in specifically Mirror's Edge Catalyst
[1:31:37] <smanana998> they went future tech with the design
[1:31:41] <petwisk> i want one all black (same for the controllers)
[1:31:42] <BigWhiteBro> how do you set anything on top of it?
[1:31:45] <andrei11dr> It kinda looks tech some evil aliens would have
[1:31:46] <arkv01> enclosed
[1:31:46] <@Solidus_113> I wonder if that plastic is going to melt or warp from the heat
[1:31:47] <mistersups> Peach says it looks like a Robot's Vagina
[1:31:51] <stevo_scar> Does it have better airflow, that's the question
[1:31:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why would you not just make the bottom flat?
[1:31:55] <arkv01> yeah ps3 and ps4 are mostly enclose
[1:31:56] <voodoolawyer> This is what they thought videogames would look like in 2100 in 2004
[1:31:58] <DatAsuna> It was clearly designed for vertical
[1:32:00] <arkv01> then they gave ps5 mech fins
[1:32:01] <%RioGascar> @menitta Specifically catalyst. This wouldnt be caught dead in mirrors edge 1
[1:32:01] <Prevot> it looks bad no matter what
[1:32:02] <DatAsuna> and it will vent better
[1:32:04] <stevo_scar> Is my PS5 going to be another jet engine
[1:32:05] <+xmetalicdemonx> I like how dumb it looks.
[1:32:09] <RichochetForce> Yeah, this was clearly designed with a chimney vent setup
[1:32:10] <%The_Timo> I mean with the Hardware I'm sure some of the design came with the engineers asking for more Airflow Intake lol
[1:32:10] <%SuperKirby24> oh god huh the bottom isnt even even huh
[1:32:13] <CazadorDeWulf> Once again, it has a Thunderbolt 3 USB port, and this has many implications for what the console will be able to do.
[1:32:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Maybe they're trying to discourage placing stuff on top of it
[1:32:17] <RichochetForce> The PS2 was the same way.
[1:32:18] <thatd00doverthere> y'all tripping that thang sexy
[1:32:19] <knowyourenemy_97> It looks good.
[1:32:19] <+jjjkopf> usb-c
[1:32:22] <DatAsuna> do you really wanna be venting it purely horizonally?
[1:32:22] <@Menitta> Specifically Catalyst yes
[1:32:24] <%nepwar> i hope it does vent better and not sound like a mach 12 jet engine
[1:32:24] <Mrthefro> NO
[1:32:25] <Solidnick18> @stevo_scar it's got the fins so yeah
[1:32:27] <RichochetForce> Nope
[1:32:33] <%tokenreefer> it looks bad. it doesnt match anything you would have in your entertainment system
[1:32:33] <knowyourenemy_97> Digital >>> Disc
[1:32:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:32:37] <Solidnick18> that things gonna suck of alot of dust
[1:32:37] <sexdrugsvideogames> the ps3 looked like a tombstone
[1:32:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> Just realized they didnt show KOF XV woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:32:42] <Solidnick18> up*
[1:32:43] <RichochetForce> Yeah, physical presence matters
[1:32:44] <Prevot> who's even going to stores anymore
[1:32:45] <knowyourenemy_97> No more scratch disc!
[1:32:46] <+jiggy_snipe> yea
[1:32:46] <mistersups> Gamestop doesn't have the lobbying power to stop it anymore.
[1:32:48] <Shardlab> Internet is much of the US sucks
[1:32:48] <exileshadow03> I think the "V" element of the design is similar to the dev kit version
[1:32:49] <Mayachacha> agreed with woolie
[1:32:49] <fuji_92> nah disc is gonna stay
[1:32:54] <Winner_92> yeah physical is never gonna go away fully
[1:32:55] <RichochetForce> Also, downloads in many places are not a viable way of playing games.
[1:32:56] <+jiggy_snipe> Retailers like having the boxes
[1:32:56] <Prevot> we can't even leave our houses
[1:32:58] <Byr0nX> boxes
[1:33:02] <%tokenreefer> who wants a white console
[1:33:04] <muniea3> how will people get their Madden?
[1:33:06] <Shardlab> So the digital only option may not b the most viable
[1:33:06] <Mayachacha> collection editions at least
[1:33:08] <+jiggy_snipe> if its all digital, game sections will suffer
[1:33:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Who the fuck goes to video game stores?!
[1:33:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean
[1:33:11] <sarg1010> Chances are disks will always be available, even if the box literally just has a code in it or something
[1:33:11] <smanana998> the ps4 was so simple and perfect this is complicated to look at
[1:33:11] <Teras_ode> just download the 10 year old game from the defunct digital store 4Head
[1:33:12] <%RioGascar> They can still create their own boxs
[1:33:13] <DatAsuna> the box is marketing itself
[1:33:16] <+lagmar99> its gonna be a box that holds a code instead of a disc
[1:33:17] <voodoolawyer> lul the outside world in 2020
[1:33:19] <@Menitta> at least they didnt add another layer like the PS4 Pro lol
[1:33:21] <%GueyDuckB> ok boomer
[1:33:21] <%RioGascar> and just put a code in the box
[1:33:22] <bethore> There's always the route of digital codes in cases.....
[1:33:23] <+king_of_beggars> People need something to play their RedBox rentals on.
[1:33:25] <+jiggy_snipe> @CommanderSqueaks parents
[1:33:26] <%Camail> some boxes just have codes
[1:33:27] <+Vigonept> EMPTY BOX WITH CODE
[1:33:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jiggy_snipe Fuck em
[1:33:30] <knowyourenemy_97> Disc sucks
[1:33:32] <Mayachacha> I think we all underestimate the amount of parents who buy video games like this
[1:33:32] <%ekodrop> cut out the middle man
[1:33:34] <DatAsuna> I hope it's not as sleek as it looks, would be a fingerprint magnet like ps3 fat
[1:33:35] <voodoolawyer> YOU DOWNLOAD THE CONSOLE?
[1:33:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus which version is gonna be cheaper, digital only or one with disk drive
[1:33:37] <Byr0nX> cryme time version
[1:33:38] <Xandertrejo> black on black console
[1:33:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> AYOOO WAIT
[1:33:39] <sexdrugsvideogames> disc rule
[1:33:40] <RichochetForce> @Mayachacha Exactly
[1:33:40] <%SuperKirby24> cardboard disc with the code on it LUL
[1:33:45] <+flumfers> I really wish that they would stop removing additional USB drives from the front of the console. The last time I felt that I had an appropriate amount of USB slots on a console that uses rechargeable controllers was the launch PS3
[1:33:49] <zaxitor> need the disc reader for JP only imports
[1:33:51] <Dalonomus> god damn im worried about weather my stick will work on the ps5!
[1:33:53] <DatAsuna> it sounds fine
[1:33:55] <time_axis> It's weird when all 3 of you are talking at once
[1:33:57] <%Lionkevinson> White on black
[1:34:00] <stevo_scar> @Menitta That would be amazing. The amount of layers on your playstation determines its power level
[1:34:00] <%RioGascar> again not sure why they didnt show anything for psvr 2.0 considering they confirmed that is happening
[1:34:01] <Lunalios> prices for digital and disc will be interesting
[1:34:02] <+jiggy_snipe> what did they do with pc games? I know it became boxes with codes eventually
[1:34:06] <DaBigVitus> sounds fine
[1:34:07] <+GhastlyGrains> rtx voice is incredible
[1:34:09] <RichochetForce> It sounds fine.
[1:34:09] <exileshadow03> Sounded fine to me
[1:34:10] <Tha_Mik> oh hey
[1:34:10] <%ekodrop> for fight sticks
[1:34:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> sounds like radio
[1:34:12] <%alrobot2014> souds fine for the most part
