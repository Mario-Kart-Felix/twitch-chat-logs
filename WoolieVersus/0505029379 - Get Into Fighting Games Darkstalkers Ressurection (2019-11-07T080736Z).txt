[0:16:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> just above freeman (who's the true ass tier)
[0:16:32] <%Typhas90> Morrigan has a good throw game, since her throw does the same damage teched
[0:16:32] <didgereedoodah> I play BB and Hsien Ko pray for me
[0:16:38] <sagamin> but remember there are no honest charcters in this game

[0:22:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[0:23:01] <didgereedoodah> yes command and proxy normal
[0:23:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> there are command normals/proxy normals
[0:23:16] <+Exyoh> You know you're in for it when you hear the QSound jingle
[0:23:20] <@Menitta> Proxy normals are awful
[0:23:23] <+cafefunk> Its Woolie and best girl Jimmy! hamp mom
[0:23:27] <BreakerPangolin> short for proximity normal, for anyone confused. also known as "close"
[0:23:28] <Kulix76> Snk and capcom where gods at sprite work
[0:23:29] <+gustavozxd> without the vaseline filter it can look even better
[0:23:29] <%TopLeftCenter> short for proximity, also called close normals

[0:23:54] <%Typhas90> Command Normals are specific attacks that require you to hold a direction
[0:23:57] <Supabait> ahh i see we are in the worst and best fighting game stage of all time
[0:23:58] <Arek_1> First time I've ever heard it shortened to "proxy normals." Usually I hear proximity normals or close normals.
[0:24:06] <pillowwasp> I would kill for another high quality sprite fighter
[0:24:25] <+gustavozxd> jesus christ and it's really fast too

[0:24:51] <pillowwasp> @queequegtheater I’m thinking more like pixel art
[0:24:54] <soulkarl> yikes woolie turn off that sprite smoothing
[0:25:00] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> We got guardbreaks YEEE
[0:25:08] <MichaelDood> Cooool
[0:25:10] <JayEarly> NO BLOCKSTUN?
[0:25:14] <TheBensonator_> M O T I V A T E D

[0:25:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> Kreygasm
[0:25:28] <@Menitta> thank god
[0:25:29] <BreakerPangolin> i cant wait till they have to explain how convoluted pushblocking is
[0:25:33] <soulkarl> nope - fuck that crisp shit
[0:25:38] <%BrooklynAI> Can you delay your air normals?
[0:25:41] <+gustavozxd> calebGasm
[0:25:44] <MichaelDood> Delicious pixels!!
[0:25:47] <+QueequegTheater> @pillowwasp Hmm, that's pretty tough. Honestly this game is too high res to be considered pixel art IMO
[0:25:54] <Super_Voltekka> Look at all those pulsating nipples
[0:25:54] <ReapingRook> Is this the ps3 version?
[0:26:01] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @ReapingRook Yes
[0:26:12] <TheGershon> It's improperly scaled, check the fake transparency on the meters
[0:26:18] <JayEarly> phat pixels quiettAww
[0:26:26] <%Ailerus> you can kara normals into specials to gain extra meter too
[0:26:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @6PoundsofShrimp thank! check out Octopimp, he plays old stuff usually and occasionally Guilty Gear, he's got a really good Pot
[0:26:36] <pillowwasp> @queequegtheater I get what you mean. I just like the look a lot
[0:26:45] <+function_2> Beowulf POG
[0:26:52] <sagamin> this move is dirty
[0:26:55] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @Admiral_PopnFresh OH shit that's amazing, I know him from 50% off, didn't know he played fighting games
[0:26:58] <@Menitta> Oh yeah Ruby Heart was a Darkstalkers character
[0:27:01] <+QueequegTheater> I swear I think Plague turned me furry
[0:27:19] <+QueequegTheater> Wait WTF is this emblem
[0:27:20] <JayEarly> what does “Kara” mean?
[0:27:24] <%BrooklynAI> I like that
[0:27:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEYEYEY
[0:27:28] <MichaelDood> uuuuh
[0:27:40] <%Typhas90> Kara means that you are cancelling the move before it becomes active
[0:28:01] <%Typhas90> so if something is special cancellable, you can cancel the KIara'd normal with it
[0:28:02] <smashfan64> this isn't Sonic Smackdown :P
[0:28:05] <%BrooklynAI> wtf is that normal??
[0:28:12] <%mr_sups> @JayEarly Kara means 'Empty.' You are Canceling out of an attack that hasn't even connected yet.
[0:28:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @6PoundsofShrimp there's a really fun video where he shows Woolie the ins and outs of Rev2, and boddies him, a sort of like a proto GITFG
[0:28:20] <BreakerPangolin> crescent kick
[0:28:26] <+QueequegTheater> Fucking massive antiair normal
[0:28:27] <+ilpeggiore_> this is sonic, but it's the reboot where he is a wolf
[0:28:47] <+razielhex> No heresy allowed concerning John Talbain
[0:28:54] <+QueequegTheater> This is sonic in a timeline where they realized that the smart thing was to make Sonic even more furry bait
[0:29:06] <+QueequegTheater> And it's working for me TBH
[0:29:08] <%Mattocat> hey man, he's just a martial artist
[0:29:10] <smashfan64> ah yes.
[0:29:12] <%Mattocat> he wants to go fast
[0:29:14] <%Mattocat> ...wait a sec
[0:29:17] <%Mattocat> shit
[0:29:20] <Arek_1> @pillowwasp Basically check out any of Capcom's CPS2 and CPS3 fighters, Guilty Gear pre-Xrd, and UNICLR.
[0:29:23] <+razielhex> Talbain predates Killer Instinct's Sabrewulf
[0:29:24] <%mr_sups> Some characters can Kara cancel out of moves that move them forward in order to extend range on close range, high power moves.
[0:29:33] <unreso> bb hood is the only character worth playing
[0:29:35] <+function_2> lul
[0:29:40] <MichaelDood> YEYEYE
[0:29:47] <candidateplays> Oh god, it's Fetus of God
[0:29:48] <+Deadpool2450> FUCKING BUBBLES
[0:29:49] <TheBensonator_> MAAAAAN
[0:29:50] <+Qsmash_> bubble is cheap as fuck
[0:29:52] <+cafefunk> Im not saying anything but this fish man is kind of a looker 👀
[0:29:54] <zucchinibread> the bubbles fishoNEPTUNE
[0:29:54] <smashfan64> who all wants to watch the Darkstalkers animated series?
[0:29:55] <sagamin> unblockable bubble
[0:30:00] <+QueequegTheater> jesus christ it's Jason Bourne
[0:30:00] <+EverythingWhiffs> This game is so tight I run a weekly tournament
[0:30:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @razielhex but the original Sabrewulf character is from like an Atari game
[0:30:07] <+Qsmash_> curiously attractive for a fish man
[0:30:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> not atari, but ZX spectrum
[0:30:13] <+razielhex> Kikuo sn't bad for fishman, but Trident from Eternal Champions has him beat.
[0:30:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> chat full of monsterfuckers tonight cmonBruh
[0:30:26] <+cafefunk> Oops, everyone saw
[0:30:27] <+QueequegTheater> @FuqBoiSlim shut up you love it
[0:30:33] <+razielhex> Yo @WoolieVersus When Eternal Champions and Challenge from the Dark Side on Sega CD!?
[0:30:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yeah i think i'd agree that this Rikuo fellow looks oddly handsome
[0:30:34] <pillowwasp> @arek_1 I get it. I guess some of it is the changes in art direction that have come about in the past 20 years
[0:30:36] <smashfan64> gotta fuck them monsters. no one else will
[0:30:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> even if he's a fishman
[0:30:43] <$KnivesEve> oh hey some darkstalkers nice
[0:30:45] <didgereedoodah> okay but Q Bee tho
[0:30:48] <+razielhex> He's got squiddy tentacles
[0:30:48] <+cafefunk> Ive been exposed
[0:30:50] <MichaelDood> WutFace
[0:30:53] <BalloniWright> @FuqBoiSlim ikr
[0:30:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> @queequegtheater perhaps
[0:31:13] <+cafefunk> But hey, gonna get some sushi tonight, if you know what im saying 😎
[0:31:14] <+QueequegTheater> We're just honest with ourselves, I'm not attracted to human men, but I'd suck Talbain's dick if he asked
[0:31:20] <smashfan64> oh god I forgot about this stage
[0:31:26] <+QueequegTheater> nothing gay about that
[0:31:26] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:31:35] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> wow

[0:32:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> are they playing on ps3?
[0:32:28] <%Irridium> god of feetus
[0:32:37] <+QueequegTheater> Reedus of God
[0:32:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> nvm they are
[0:32:45] <anAngryHamster> He's not THAT attractive...
[0:32:49] <%ChoculaUltra> always loved Talbain's walking animation
[0:32:50] <+cafefunk> Well shit, Capcom better make a new darkstalkers so i can see this fish up close and personal MindManners
[0:32:51] <smashfan64> yes he is
[0:32:53] <%mr_sups> POTENTIAL DAMAGE
[0:32:59] <smashfan64> don't lie
[0:32:59] <+QueequegTheater> @anAngryHamster apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[0:33:21] <%Mattocat> both mediums, both heavies
[0:33:27] <+QueequegTheater> He's a sexy wolf boi who is probably a good cuddler too
[0:33:30] <%Ailerus> if u wanna have a great time in this game play sasquatch
[0:33:31] <%Typhas90> Both lights too
[0:33:32] <MichaelDood> WUT
[0:33:38] <%Mattocat> dark force is Blazblue Overdrive
[0:33:39] <%ChoculaUltra> riding dat ray
[0:33:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> He's riding a horshoe crab
[0:33:53] <Arek_1> @pillowwasp One reason that the CPS1/2/3 games look good is because the game was drawn stretched horizontally at 384x224 and squished into the the proper 4:3 aspect ratio, allowing for better detail horizontally.
[0:33:54] <+SaltySombrero> @Ailerus trying to get more peopleo n the dark side
[0:34:08] <%ChoculaUltra> oh wow, that is just a large horseshoe crab. my mistake.
[0:34:15] <Arek_1> Dark Force.
[0:34:18] <TheGershon> This is like both players time stopping in jojo
[0:34:24] <+QueequegTheater> As cool as the wave is, I like Talbain's install a bit more tbh
[0:34:28] <smashfan64> if they ever do another DS I hope it's 2D
[0:34:39] <picante_papi> Wassup chat
[0:34:43] <MichaelDood> WTF
[0:34:54] <JayEarly> this game is nuts
[0:34:57] <+QueequegTheater> @xGOMIEx Hi we're all thirsty of John Talbain tonight
[0:34:59] <smashfan64> OR let Arksys do it
[0:35:00] <%BrooklynAI> YOOOOOO
[0:35:01] <BreakerPangolin> some characters have very worthless darkforces, some characters have very useful ones (like rikuo)
[0:35:02] <+Qsmash_> I like the horseshoe crab
[0:35:11] <MichaelDood> This fishman is filthy
[0:35:12] <%ChoculaUltra> I now understand why the Darkstalkers arc was so long in the Daigo manga.
[0:35:17] <Supabait> B R U H
[0:35:20] <BalloniWright> ya know, I was a huge Weregarurumon fan when I was a kid LUL
[0:35:21] <+SaltySombrero> Felicia's Darkforce is great
[0:35:29] <MichaelDood> ATTRACTIVE....but filthy.
[0:35:42] <picante_papi> @QueequegTheater I've come to the right place then Kappa
[0:35:48] <cham52> Which Bloody Roar is this?
[0:35:52] <%Ailerus> DF invuln is different per char
[0:35:53] <+OkamiDude15> 2.5
[0:35:54] <%Typhas90> @WoolieVersus Darkforce on activation is invulnerable up to when the character can act, but have a vulnerable deactivation, with the exception being Jedah and Q-Bee
[0:36:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> damn, this shit is so crazy
[0:36:12] <+QueequegTheater> @xGOMIEx If wanting Rikuo and Talbain to Eiffel Tower me in a Wendy's mens room is wrong, being right is boring
[0:36:20] <%Mattocat> Dark force is generally, dangerous
[0:36:41] <%Typhas90> it's a huge risk that has huge payoff if you call it right
[0:36:44] <%Mattocat> the punishment for the recovery animation is really bad
[0:36:49] <BalloniWright> @QueequegTheater hey, alright atpCap
[0:37:02] <cham52> I just noticed the baby in the background what the hell
[0:37:04] <+QueequegTheater> Chat, I'm gonna go take a cold shower
[0:37:16] <%Typhas90> You need to be on the crab to get the benefits

[0:39:00] <%Typhas90> Crab provides Hyper Armor for Rikuo, and a pseudo Flight Mode, at least as long as he is on the crab
[0:39:08] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Okay but here's the important question: who gives better cuddles, Rikuo or Talbain?
[0:39:22] <+QueequegTheater> My money's on John

[0:48:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus ask when jedah is
[0:48:54] <+Hagure> vsav things
[0:49:16] <%Ailerus> one throw is P and the two throw is K
[0:49:20] <%Ailerus> i think
[0:49:28] <zenith0111> YO NEW TECH
[0:49:29] <MichaelDood> NEW TECH?
[0:49:34] <%ChoculaUltra> tongue tech?!
[0:49:34] <+Hagure> for fish double throw, throw on one side, then you gotta time a throw the opposite side right when he slams on the ground
[0:49:34] <TheGershon> second hit is k maybe
[0:49:35] <%Typhas90> as long as the button you are using to tech is also a throw, you can do it
[0:49:39] <sagamin> i don't remember if fish has a throw on kicks
[0:49:40] <MichaelDood> [BRING ME TO LIFE]
[0:49:44] <%HDmexiqtioner> I'm trying to remember, what's the gimmick with the flame with the timer? Is that like momentum?

[0:49:57] <+SaltySombrero> @HDmexiqtioner ot
[0:50:04] <%HDmexiqtioner> ot?
[0:50:06] <+Hagure> so like 4HK ~ 6HK
[0:50:10] <+SaltySombrero> @HDmexiqtioner iit's just a stylish way of showing you getting hit
[0:50:13] <+SaltySombrero> nothing more
[0:50:16] <BreakerPangolin> the flame doesnt mean anything, just indicating who is attacking and being attacked
[0:50:17] <+Hagure> or 4HP ~ 6HP i forget which one it is
[0:50:25] <TheGershon> Gloomy Puppet Show?
[0:50:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh fuck i love jedah
[0:50:50] <+Hagure> only way to combo after dash mp is with dash lp (its a link)
[0:50:53] <%HDmexiqtioner> ooooh ok
[0:50:56] <Dlent_> They don’t chain
[0:51:02] <sagamin> you can link it
[0:51:03] <+Hagure> then you can do a chain off of the LP
[0:51:07] <Dlent_> Fish has to do a 1f link
[0:51:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Those pulsating bulbs are real creepy

[0:58:21] <Gilbals> New tech
[0:58:22] <Shardlab> The fetus awakens when the world comes to an end
[0:58:22] <+Hagure> I explained it above
[0:58:36] <+QueequegTheater> @Hagure so the fetus is literally Azathoth
[0:58:42] <+Hagure> you do like 4 HP ~ 6 HP
[0:58:46] <%Typhas90> @WoolieVersus Bishamon, Sasquatch, another Rikuo, and Hsien-Ko have armor
[0:58:50] <hamahiroyuki> you said that morrigan is bottom tier rite? maybe thats why shes the one who gets guest slots in other games. her bullshit is less game breaking?
[0:58:50] <%ChoculaUltra> always thought the Darkstalkers lore would make a dope JRPG.
[0:59:01] <+Hagure> right when he slams him the first time, do a throw the opposite side
[0:59:06] <+Hagure> not half circle
[0:59:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think its cause shes hot idk
[0:59:15] <groovykrovvy> oh, your trying to bounce chase, right?
[0:59:16] <+Hagure> strict timing
[0:59:21] <sagamin> half circle back
[0:59:22] <%Typhas90> it's like 3 frames timing

[0:59:31] <+SaltySombrero> @hamahiroyuki it's pretty much because she's fanservice
[0:59:52] <+Hagure> its very important for advanced fish, for when you're in the corner, cuz you can bubble jail in a defensive position

[1:02:07] <+gustavozxd> @FuqBoiSlim probably

[1:02:32] <+QueequegTheater> ok boomer
[1:02:39] <+gustavozxd> the Brazil stage in SFV is still my fav, the fact that they put a soccer trophy instead of the jesus statue is just LUL
[1:02:44] <@Menitta> but he's kinda right....
[1:02:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolmer
[1:02:45] <BreakerPangolin> you CAN fuck with perspective in 3d, but that requires competent artists and a company willing to pay them
[1:02:46] <+RenoDeGeneric> LIGHT PUNCH, LIGHT kick
[1:02:49] <%ChoculaUltra> I got lost for friggin hours just going through stages to add to mugen. KOF has some insane ones too.
[1:02:55] <+OkamiDude15> thats one hell of a button
[1:03:02] <groovykrovvy> DARKSTALKERS NOT DEAD
[1:03:02] <+Qsmash_> I mean, it's possible to force perspective in 3D
[1:03:05] <@Menitta> KOF stages are on another level
[1:03:07] <+gustavozxd> snk stages are something else, CVS1 has some insane stuff too
[1:03:07] <+fizzguy47> member 2d stages?
[1:03:07] <Shardlab> It requires a bit of work to make that kinda thing in 3D

[1:03:55] <+TopTieramisu> kof 13 is a visual orgasm
[1:04:08] <%HDmexiqtioner> Is this only a PSN thing or did this ever get a physical collection release?
[1:04:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> my favorite fg stage has to be guy's stage in alpha 2 cuz when you walk past cody with a female character he starts checking them out and Jessica smacks tf outta him
[1:04:14] <TungstenViper> @Dhurkst the fisheye effect is a post process effect. it's gonna make the characters look distorted too
[1:04:23] <%ChoculaUltra> bro, Kim Kapwhan's pants in KOF 13 is the height of sprite animation lmao
[1:04:28] <+QueequegTheater> jumping A, then jumping A, then follow that up with a jumping A, then do another jumping A
[1:04:30] <+BurkeBigsby> Such a drag to see how KOF14 looks in comparison.
[1:04:53] <mr_ESB> Hoping kof15 looks better
[1:04:53] <+TopTieramisu> give them a break. it was their first foray at 3d
[1:04:58] <+Miller483> @WoolieVersus when are you doing online matches, this is Miller2B btw

[1:05:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> when's a new game coming
[1:05:51] <+BurkeBigsby> I didn't say it looks bad. Just an inevitable observation when godlike sprites were present.
[1:06:00] <Super_Voltekka> So is a anyone gonna talk about how insane the lore of Darkstalkers is?
[1:06:02] <+dieselssb> Reggie, what's the most bullshit fighting game?
[1:06:03] <%HDmexiqtioner> Miller2B is a G, he fucking goes HAM at Michigan Masters with Vampire Savior and other games.
[1:06:16] <Dhurkst> @TungstenViper Good point, lol. I'm tired, not thinking straight. You could probably alter character meshes to compensate for that, though it would be a lot of work.
[1:06:34] <+ilpeggiore_> that's perverse

[1:20:31] <+QueequegTheater> @shardlab Nah, actually the last thing in the box was absolute knowledge of your own fate, and Pandora closed the box before it could get out and everyone would kill themselves
[1:20:32] <DianaTheAscian> cause its cool
[1:20:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> you wanna learn how to do a fucking infinite!
[1:20:43] <Linkdude777> origin of valkenhein doing it

[1:20:50] <Shardlab> Well, hope makes for a better story

[1:20:52] <%Mattocat> lmao
[1:20:55] <JayEarly> that’s some big dick damage
[1:20:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:21:03] <%ChoculaUltra> I always thought Valkenhein was an homage to Talbain
[1:21:09] <%Mattocat> yes you can TK it but it's delay
[1:21:09] <+nechallenger> Air Beast cannon into ES climhazard
[1:21:13] <+razielhex> @QueequegTheater Yeah, that's called the Bucket of Truth. It has absolute truth.
[1:21:20] <%HDmexiqtioner> TECH
[1:21:24] <+QueequegTheater> Nah, certainty is a better story. Hope is just a happier one but doesn't make sense, why would it be there with all the evils
[1:21:25] <+razielhex> It's in my living room
[1:21:33] <+razielhex> Standard thing
[1:21:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> got a command grab
[1:21:44] <%Mattocat> its not a charge
[1:21:46] <%Mattocat> just down up
[1:21:49] <mr_ESB> Ibuki kick?
[1:21:56] <sagamin> you don't have to charge
[1:22:03] <Shardlab> No one said hope wasn't a bad thing when nothing good is going to happen
[1:22:04] <DingusMcBaseball> damn
[1:22:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> jesus fuck
[1:22:12] <%Mattocat> it has NO INVULN
[1:22:15] <MichaelDood> Who needs to CHARGE a Flash Kick? Kappa
[1:22:18] <%Mattocat> it is not really a flash kick
[1:22:24] <BreakerPangolin> so is it Razer or Lazer
[1:22:26] <+razielhex> it's a flashy kick
[1:22:30] <mr_ESB> That combos cool lol
[1:22:31] <%Mattocat> yeah
[1:22:32] <+QueequegTheater> @BreakerPangolin Blazer
[1:22:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> and yeti is the cheapest fuck in this game btw
[1:22:41] <Arek_1> I bet Talbain has comparitively weaker okizeme.
[1:22:42] <sagamin> his flash kick has no invincibility tho
[1:22:51] <Shardlab> Sasquach will make you pull your hair
[1:22:55] <%HDmexiqtioner> Rem Lazar for Darkstalkers
[1:23:11] <%Mattocat> chipping is bad bc gaurd cancels
[1:23:17] <generalve> why is hell is morrigan always in the Capcom crossovers and not this coolmass saberwokf ?!
[1:23:20] <%Ailerus> chipping is wonderful
[1:23:23] <MichaelDood> but i like nunchucks :(
[1:23:25] <+ChansonNoire> rem lazar too strong
[1:23:28] <generalve> don't tell me cause ass and tittes
[1:23:32] <+QueequegTheater> @generalve he is too powerful
[1:23:36] <groovykrovvy> hey guys, im late, did they do BB Hood yet?
[1:23:37] <UnfilteredComic> @HDmexiqtioner The Dark Force just takes him even higher
[1:23:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> okay it's her thighs too
[1:23:44] <+QueequegTheater> Also he's way hotter than Morrigan
[1:23:45] <Shardlab> You have listed the reason why: T&A
[1:23:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus who is the cheapest character in this game btw, like, the top tier character, is it yeti?
[1:23:51] <mr_ESB> Morrigans the ds poster character?
[1:24:08] <Shardlab> And despite the weebs, I like the hot Irish accent
[1:24:23] <MichaelDood> WutFace
[1:24:25] <generalve> what is woolie looking at ? LUL
[1:24:35] <+Miller483> @CaptainPileDriver Zabel/Lord Raptor is top 1
[1:24:45] <%Typhas90> @CaptainPileDriver generally Raptor, (a.k.a, Zabel) is considered the best
[1:24:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> really? is lord raptor really that good?
[1:24:53] <+Miller483> absolutely
[1:24:56] <+Miller483> character has everything lmao
[1:24:56] <+Hagure> @CaptainPileDriver top tier is zombie, followed by sasquatch
[1:25:00] <+Qsmash_> it's really fun to press buttons with wolf
[1:25:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> what the hell does he have that makes him stupid cheap
[1:25:03] <+Hagure> zombie is harder to play tho
[1:25:09] <%Typhas90> yes, but he requires execution to be able to do the real dumb stuff
[1:25:13] <DracaenaLeaf> Talbain and Felicia are usually the best beginner characters
[1:25:17] <+nechallenger> Lord Raptor's j.lk last two frames are unblockable
[1:25:22] <%Mattocat> Lord Raptor has an unblockable d.LK that he can combo into a ground super. It's hard, but the reward is high enough to make him the best character
[1:25:23] <+Hagure> but the thing that puts him on top is controllable normals, and the infamous unblockable jLK
[1:25:26] <%Typhas90> last 3 frames, actually
[1:25:28] <+Miller483> amazing neutral, unblockable into 60%, great normals
[1:25:31] <+Miller483> uhhh
[1:25:34] <+nechallenger> ah you're right, sorry
[1:25:34] <mr_ESB> Whose bottom tier?
[1:25:35] <%Mattocat> j.LK which he can do with dash too
[1:25:41] <%Mattocat> sorry, air dash, I'm tired.
[1:25:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> jesus
[1:25:46] <%Mattocat> IAD j,LK
[1:25:50] <%Typhas90> Anakaris, Victor, Morrigan, Jedah are considered the worst
[1:25:59] <%ChoculaUltra> Jesus is low tier? Not surprised he's in the Darkstalkers lore tbh.
[1:26:03] <%Typhas90> Anakaris being the absolute worst
[1:26:08] <mr_ESB> I see
[1:26:11] <Shardlab> I like Jedah, but damn does he have a lotta windup
[1:26:15] <%Mattocat> it's actually the opposite
[1:26:16] <TM9001> also psychological damage
[1:26:19] <generalve> Reggie looks boss as fuck with a beard
[1:26:28] <%Typhas90> it is the other way around, yeah
[1:26:29] <%Mattocat> Moment slice does more permanent damage than ES Beast Cannon
[1:26:33] <sagamin> anakaris is the worst and he still has an insane mix up game
[1:26:41] <%Typhas90> so really: it's Jedah, Morrigan, Victor, Anakaris
[1:26:43] <%Ailerus> do ES nunchucks

[1:41:40] <DSD24> Don't forget that Q Bee's eyes aren't real eyes

[1:42:15] <+Qsmash_> Sas shorthoped on my dreams
[1:42:18] <+ChansonNoire> why not smoke if you dont have lungs atpSuspect
[1:42:22] <%Mattocat> Iron Horse, Iron Terror is the best stage
[1:42:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> tbe mouth is for the coal duh Kappa
[1:42:31] <DSD24> My favorite stage is the one on the sideways sky scrapers
[1:42:32] <%Mattocat> can't play on arcade :( best part of playing on a console
[1:42:32] <+ilpeggiore_> it's the only stage i remember of this game lol
[1:42:34] <DracaenaLeaf> Wasn't this the second-to-last stage in arcade mode?
[1:42:40] <%ledshamans> ledshamans subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months!
[1:42:41] <%Mattocat> check out that conductor
[1:42:42] <+dj_berserk_ix> @ChansonNoire atpTopSpeed
[1:42:44] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, skele conductor w/ cig really is a vibe tho
[1:42:46] <%HDmexiqtioner> Did she just throw a DDT?
[1:42:48] <+big_boi_bigg> look at that conductor
[1:42:57] <bang_camaro> this is the second to last stage, you cant get in versus mode on arcade
[1:42:58] <+ChansonNoire> atpTopSpeed atpTopSpeed atpTopSpeed
[1:43:01] <sagamin> with q bee MP is your friend
[1:43:05] <bang_camaro> when they playin online
[1:43:06] <DSD24> J Talbain also has the best blocking animation
[1:43:12] <lem______> did I miss sasquatch
[1:43:19] <+OkamiDude15> i dont believe so
[1:43:21] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpCap atpTopSpeed
[1:43:22] <%TopLeftCenter> get him doing ground dash MP
[1:43:22] <Super_Voltekka> Anyone else notice that the conductor of the train is a spoopy skeleton?
[1:43:27] <bang_camaro> yes
[1:43:32] <%Mattocat> J.Talbain is one of the more challenging characters for beginners to overcome. He forces you to learn how to stop jumping characters
[1:43:50] <JayEarly> spooky smoking skeletons
[1:43:58] <%Mattocat> yes or spacing anti airs
[1:44:00] <bang_camaro> the floor is lava in this game
[1:44:06] <%Mattocat> is it dash MP for QBee?
[1:44:11] <%Mattocat> I forget
[1:44:17] <%Irridium> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[1:44:27] <bang_camaro> 5 hit es beast cannon
[1:44:30] <%Mattocat> you can use Dash MP as basically a meaty t ostop jumps
[1:44:37] <%Mattocat> then off the air reset, do an airdash mixup
[1:44:40] <%ChoculaUltra> if reggie wins a fight with the df nunchucks I'll lose my shit
[1:44:41] <sagamin> yes its dash mp
[1:44:42] <bang_camaro> ya mp and mk are sick anti airs
[1:44:48] <%Mattocat> The best mixups you get are off air resets
[1:44:51] <+ChansonNoire> REGGIE NUNCHUCKS
[1:44:54] <+ChansonNoire> do IT
[1:45:00] <%Mattocat> the reward for an anti air is a real mixup and big reward
[1:45:13] <+QueequegTheater> Eww give him his wolf form back
[1:45:15] <+OkamiDude15> where are those 60% nunchucks reggie nkoG
[1:45:18] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> REGGIE WINS
[1:45:19] <%Mattocat> hell yeah this energy
[1:45:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> "You feel it too dont you?"
[1:45:21] <+Miller483> teach the wolf player the throw OSes
[1:45:22] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sbfpYeyeye
[1:45:23] <%HDmexiqtioner> Is there a Japanese Warewolf equivalent?
[1:45:25] <+Miller483> the real grimy shit
[1:45:27] <TigerClaws12> shit's getting HEATED LUL
[1:45:31] <%RadicalEssay> RadicalEssay subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[1:45:55] <%HDmexiqtioner> FOOTSIES ?
[1:45:56] <sagamin> MP is good for catching jump attempts
[1:45:58] <+RenoDeGeneric> So why don't people play the other versions of Darkstalkers?
[1:46:05] <That_Mojo> Reggie get him with that corner trap double team
[1:46:07] <bang_camaro> fish has a dive so thats something
[1:46:14] <+ChansonNoire> @RenoDeGeneric the ones after are wack
[1:46:37] <%Mattocat> and then he runs a whole health bar if you knock down in the corner into bubble
[1:46:39] <+RenoDeGeneric> but like what happened? Balance? Cuz man I just wanna play Donovan
[1:46:43] <+razielhex> Here they come to steal my soul Ghost train Wait it out until I know Ghost train
[1:46:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh wow sasquatch
[1:46:49] <%Mattocat> Donovan is not in VSav
[1:46:55] <@Menitta> AR AR AR
[1:46:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> fucking sasquatch is a nightmare
[1:46:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> woolie no
[1:46:58] <Blodia2U> @ChansonNoire Wouldn't say they were whack. Night Warriors wasn't that bad... But the soundtrack to the first Darkstalkers was better, imo
[1:46:59] <bang_camaro> donavan also sucks
[1:46:59] <+razielhex> Trying not to feel like, Ghost train Moving up until I go go Ghost train
[1:47:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> you're thinking of snuffing puppers again
[1:47:15] <+Lord0Mugen> hey look! Theyre playing KI 0
[1:47:15] <%Mattocat> The problem with VSav 2 is a lot of really bad choices on system changes
[1:47:17] <@Menitta> Fucking Armin
[1:47:20] <cafeapathy> ahh a gorillaz song..taste..
[1:47:24] <bang_camaro> mike z sucks
[1:47:24] <DSD24> I like default color for J Talbain
[1:47:28] <+Qsmash_> LocTest Donovan was too strong FeelsBadMan
[1:47:28] <%Mattocat> Mike Z sucks
[1:47:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well, you sound like a majestic fucking eagle, can you sing?!
[1:47:29] <+Miller483> everyone plays Lei Lei
[1:47:32] <%ChoculaUltra> didn't VSAV 2 drop a few more characters from the roster too?
[1:47:32] <+ilpeggiore_> reggie is the cool kid in this arcade
[1:47:34] <+ChansonNoire> they changed the systems around and it feels like they put in bugs lol
[1:47:45] <MichaelDood> She throws a bust of Akuma doesn't she?
[1:47:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> mike z add the move list to indivisible already
[1:48:03] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @TungstenViper
[1:48:06] <Blodia2U> Now Night Warriors 2 and Vampire SAvior 2 were unnecessary.... Those really weren't all that good and were very meh
[1:48:12] <cafeapathy> i paid 75 cents so reggie would notice me
[1:48:13] <+QueequegTheater> Did Mike Z make the story suck any less
[1:48:16] <ZeroCount> My favorite song in the game
[1:48:20] <+dieselssb> lol of course woolie would play fish blanka in this game
[1:48:22] <DSD24> Is Jedah good in this game?
[1:48:24] <shinichizio> Return of the strangely attractive fish-man.
[1:48:32] <bang_camaro> jadahs low mid
[1:48:40] <JayEarly> What Darkstalker games are good?
[1:48:46] <+ChansonNoire> this one
[1:48:52] <sagamin> vampire savior and vampire hunter
[1:48:52] <Blodia2U> Night Warriors and Vampire Savior are good.
[1:48:53] <bang_camaro> if you arent victor or anak youre fine as a character
[1:48:56] <%Mattocat> If you hit gas full screen, try dash into sweep
[1:48:57] <@Menitta> How is BB Hood? @WoolieVersus
[1:49:05] <+big_boi_bigg> Vsav is the best Darkstalkers imo but night warriors can be fun
[1:49:05] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Make Jimmy experience that crazy Ace Combat PvP
[1:49:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:49:09] <+trinzec> what makes anakaris so trash?
[1:49:12] <+Lord0Mugen> Its that Capcom game thats as Violent as Mortal Kombat
[1:49:21] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta do you like Guile
[1:49:25] <+Lord0Mugen> ?
[1:49:28] <DSD24> Look at that hair
[1:49:28] <+dieselssb> smash 4 bayo ppmdKreygasm
[1:49:29] <sagamin> anakaris can't push block and a bunch of other things
[1:49:33] <+QueequegTheater> o.O
[1:49:43] <+QueequegTheater> That's what I know of Guile
[1:49:44] <@Menitta> Oh wow BB is like Guile
[1:49:45] <Kenny_Riot> Vampire Hunter 1 (Night Warriors) and Vampire Savior 1 (What they're playing right now) are the good ones. So basically, Darkstalkers Resurrection is all you need
[1:49:55] <bang_camaro> anak has no regular throw, push block, and his guard cancle is punishable on hit
[1:50:02] <cafeapathy> omg, just realized when bayo 3 comes out woolz will play it maybe after he's enjoyed it? excite!
[1:50:09] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta shes like a very offensive oriented Guile with a command grab
[1:50:10] <%Mattocat> instant overhead to drill
[1:50:13] <Blodia2U> Though I still think Capcom screwed up on an opportunity with DS Resurrection.
[1:50:13] <+Miller483> also it doesn't work on everyone
[1:50:16] <thelovingfool> bb seems fun, she's probably one of my favorite characters conceptually
[1:50:26] <%RadicalEssay> wolf is so short too, so you gotta be fast
[1:50:27] <+Miller483> smol characters don't have to worry about it
[1:50:36] <@Menitta> Wow thats a weird mix of archetypes
[1:50:48] <+trinzec> bb is my favorite character personality-wise, but i cant stand playing charge chars
[1:50:51] <Blodia2U> Still wish they would have added the dip switch options that were in the Sega Saturn version that allowed you to mix and match the background and soundtrack to Darkstalkers 1 and Vampire Hunter.
[1:50:55] <+dieselssb> dude look at the gills and rikuo's side, fucking nasttty
[1:50:55] <bang_camaro> that instant overhead trick gives them a free throw tho
[1:51:03] <@Menitta> BB Hood is hilarious
[1:51:09] <bang_camaro> its for closing bats ya
[1:51:14] <+Lord0Mugen> @Menitta Well the people who made VSAV went on to make Guilty Gear soooooo
[1:51:24] <+QueequegTheater> O.O
[1:51:25] <MichaelDood> WutFace
[1:51:26] <@Menitta> Ah ok that makes sense lol
[1:51:29] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> wtf
[1:51:30] <+big_boi_bigg> that win pose.....
[1:51:31] <Kenny_Riot> @Blodia2U I wish they had just done a better version of the PS1 Darkstalkers 3 with both of the Vampire Savior Rosters
[1:51:34] <+QueequegTheater> Kreygasm
[1:51:38] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> im swoon
[1:51:40] <%ChoculaUltra> so VSAV is... Guilty Gear 0?!
[1:51:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> wait wait wait
[1:51:48] <+Lord0Mugen> i guess?
[1:51:49] <+ChansonNoire> vsav is the grandfather of anime
[1:51:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> i need to catch up a bit
[1:51:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> so which is the proper version of DS/VSAV to play
[1:52:06] <+ChansonNoire> vsav
[1:52:10] <Kenny_Riot> Guntanks, they one they're playing right now
[1:52:14] <Blodia2U> @Kenny_Riot That was the other mistake they made. The Saturn and PS1 versions of VSav had all the chatacters. Resurrection they just did the basic/arcade version and didn't update it.
[1:52:14] <Kenny_Riot> That's the one most will play
[1:52:22] <bang_camaro> reggies wolf is od lmao
[1:52:24] <%Mattocat> Try whiff Punishing with ES Beast Cannon :)
[1:52:56] <%Mattocat> I mean
[1:53:03] <+ChansonNoire> reggie is a god with the animals
[1:53:05] <%Ailerus> hello... @bang_camaro
[1:53:05] <+Lord0Mugen> I mean, you can see how that would happen. VSAV and GG are very offensivie oriented games and have a lot of extra built in systems and super weird characters and twists to old archetypes.
[1:53:14] <%RadicalEssay> LP Sonic Wave trades are the wave, don't sleep on 'em!
[1:53:14] <%Mattocat> Welcome to the NWO
[1:53:18] <+Miller483> ES Beast Cannon paid my taxes and cured my cancer
[1:53:19] <%Mattocat> Wolf Pack
[1:53:20] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus As it turns out his full name is Reggie Umehara
[1:53:24] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> yeyeyeyeye
[1:53:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Kenny_Riot aye
[1:53:39] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> whiff punishingg
[1:53:41] <+Lord0Mugen> I thought Dirty Beret (the GG team at Capcom) did JoJo, but apparently it was the 3S team.
[1:54:07] <bang_camaro> @Ailerus vampir21Sasmouth PowerUpR
[1:54:13] <+Miller483> you should probably show them swipe/piano
[1:54:19] <%Ailerus> vampir21Sasmouth gamenewtonAiii
[1:54:20] <+Miller483> or whatever the fuck Jayone does
[1:54:30] <%Ailerus> jay pianos, i swipe
[1:54:33] <%yeknomlive> what's up guys
[1:54:43] <+Miller483> yeah but jay does like some weird ass piano
[1:54:46] <%Ailerus> i get the accidental dark force evade throw, also die OS
[1:54:54] <+Miller483> same
[1:54:59] <bang_camaro> pushblocking is hard no matter how you do it lmao
[1:55:14] <+Miller483> true
[1:55:24] <%Ailerus> pushblocking gets easier once you understand how to read offense patterns
[1:55:44] <+Qsmash_> Man, Reggie is good
[1:55:44] <%Ailerus> but you get hit a lot trying to anticipate it and trying to tech early
[1:55:46] <+QueequegTheater> I hate Talbain's human form
[1:55:46] <%Ailerus> gotta dial it in
[1:55:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> ok furry
[1:55:49] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> oooooos
[1:55:52] <+QueequegTheater> Just let him be a furry

[1:57:10] <%Mattocat> Reggie can add the layer now of jumping in, and blocking, not doing a jump in.

[1:57:25] <%Mattocat> because you can block that projectile
[1:57:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie's confidence is now gone

[1:59:00] <+Miller483> s.LK is very situational
[1:59:00] <+function_2> what about BB hood?
[1:59:05] <%Mattocat> It'll be difficult
[1:59:10] <+function_2> she not human
[1:59:16] <%ChoculaUltra> holy hell that Rikuo art really is hauntingly charming.
[1:59:25] <+ChansonNoire> bbhood is a good little girl

[2:06:59] <DSD24> Devocradem!
[2:06:59] <+Hagure> Bliss = 263PP
[2:06:59] <MichaelDood> Midnight Bliss is its own reward.

[2:07:27] <+dieselssb> fishbunjin 3000
[2:07:27] <+ilpeggiore_> the thing about dimitri is that he's a vampire, probably romanian, but he shouts japanese when he attacks
[2:07:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Kreygasm
[2:07:29] <+trinzec> he turns rikuo into a mermaid waif
[2:07:30] <%Irridium> oh my
[2:07:34] <Rojahh> @woolieversus how hard is learning bulleta?
[2:07:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> can you play raptor at all?
[2:07:37] <Kenny_Riot> Demitri is literally "NO HOMO": The Fighting Game Character
[2:07:41] <%Mattocat> take the air hit, then the reset,
[2:07:42] <+titanium_kyle> has any1 played Anakaris? doodFive
[2:07:43] <+nechallenger> Bulleta is extremely hard
[2:07:54] <%yeknomlive> @Rojahh check out sako combos. they're insanely tough combos
[2:07:56] <%HDmexiqtioner> what is a fish? A miserable pile splashes.
[2:08:06] <+ChansonNoire> @Rojahh she has the highest ceiling in this game, but she's straightforward when you're beginning.
[2:08:06] <+ilpeggiore_> lol
[2:08:22] <$konekoryugamine> Yo Woolie you still looking to pimp out Octopimp
[2:08:28] <%Mattocat> Because of the recoverable life in this game, backing off is generally bad because you let them heal
[2:08:28] <DSD24> Fiyah
[2:08:38] <%Mattocat> the game rewards you for keeping going
[2:08:38] <+titanium_kyle> doodMash doodGood
[2:08:43] <Rojahh> Yeesh that was the character I wanted to try lol if she’s a “sako” character lol
[2:08:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> RAPTORRR
[2:08:49] <$KnivesEve> has anyone used bb hood yet?
[2:08:52] <MichaelDood> doodInjury
[2:08:54] <bang_camaro> hitting buttons is good in this game
[2:08:58] <%HDmexiqtioner> WHY ARE YOU PRESSING BUTTONS!?
[2:09:02] <thelovingfool> @woolieversus when's vs octopimp in Sonic smackdown
[2:09:06] <DSD24> I really like Lilith
[2:09:06] <+balouie> she also has that hat trick move
[2:09:07] <+ChansonNoire> thicc loli atpGasm atpGasm
[2:09:10] <%yeknomlive> let's see the rhythm super
[2:09:18] <$konekoryugamine> Its gonna be Woolie v Octopimp
[2:09:26] <$konekoryugamine> Pimp vs Pump
[2:09:38] <$konekoryugamine> Whoever wins is the new Pimp
[2:09:43] <ThousandDogs> Woolie is the opposite of a pimp though
[2:09:48] <DSD24> Lilith has cute costumes for her win pose
[2:09:58] <ThousandDogs> Sex happens less when Woolie is around.
[2:10:17] <$konekoryugamine> So you're saying Woolie is a walking Catholic edict
[2:10:19] <Super_Voltekka> Wasn't Daigo a Lilith player at one point?
[2:10:20] <Kenny_Riot> No one understands Lillith's Rhythm game super
[2:10:22] <Kenny_Riot> MP PME
[2:10:24] <Kenny_Riot> *NO ONE
[2:10:28] <+Miller483> Daigo played bishamon iirc
[2:10:33] <%yeknomlive> daigo? ive never seen him play anything but bisha
[2:10:41] <+ChansonNoire> daigo played jedah then bishamon
[2:10:41] <Blodia2U> This is old news, but do you all remember what Lilith was originally proposed to be?
[2:10:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:10:50] <%Mattocat> lets gooo
[2:10:50] <$konekoryugamine> Can they read this
[2:10:50] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> rythm game super excuse me?
[2:10:51] <+ChansonNoire> it was nuki :)
[2:10:52] <+Miller483> lilith is a cool character
[2:10:55] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:11:01] <+Miller483> if I had the hands to combo into demon I'd probably play her
[2:11:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:11:03] <%Ailerus> eat the pizzas
[2:11:11] <%Mattocat> grab a slice
[2:11:17] <+ChansonNoire> @konekoryugamine right now the two people that can read it are playing
[2:11:22] <+balouie> gloomy puppet show I think the move is called pretty useless but fun
[2:11:43] <%HDmexiqtioner> A Gloomy Puppet Show sounds like a sex thing.
[2:11:46] <Blodia2U> People don't remember, but in the beginning, Lilith was supposed to be male -- an incubus specifically.
[2:11:46] <bang_camaro> gloomy puppet show is pretty bad and costs 2 bars
[2:12:08] <bang_camaro> cool when it works tho
[2:12:12] <groovykrovvy> git gud at ddr, tho
[2:12:24] <%yeknomlive> i love the sound of arcade sticks on these old capcom games
[2:12:27] <+balouie> yeah great when it works but probably pretty useless in a match
[2:12:30] <+razielhex> Diablo IV villain lookin' strong
[2:12:31] <%yeknomlive> like the mashing on mvc2 supers
[2:12:33] <DSD24> That outfit is cute
[2:12:33] <+ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus you gotta block and pushblock Kappa
[2:12:45] <+QueequegTheater> drop your shield
[2:12:45] <+ilpeggiore_> she's so cute you don't wanna block her grabs
[2:13:22] <%HDmexiqtioner> PHELPS
[2:13:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> BREASTSTROKE BREASTSTROKE
[2:13:33] <%Mattocat> I'm so happy they're having fun with this
[2:13:34] <+Qsmash_> SHINING BLADE
[2:13:38] <groovykrovvy> dont drop a combo, thats a mortgage
[2:13:40] <That_Mojo> swimming for gold place
[2:13:41] <zamzoph> Is Phelps going to compete again?
[2:13:49] <MichaelDood> LUL
[2:13:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> YOU IDiOT YOU CALL THAT SWIMMING?!
[2:13:53] <+razielhex> more likr DROWN
[2:13:55] <+balouie> nope he retired
[2:14:16] <+razielhex> Phelps is a mutant anyway
[2:14:30] <zamzoph> uh-oh, America under threat now monkaS
[2:14:34] <%yeknomlive> hows lilith compare to morrigan
[2:14:37] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> CHIC CHICK
[2:14:40] <+razielhex> she's smaller
[2:14:49] <+razielhex> finds clothes easier in her size
[2:15:00] <%Mattocat> IMHO I want to just point out for people in stream, this game was this easy to start playing decently. It's enjoyable at different levels of play
[2:15:20] <Kenny_Riot> The Rhythm game super
[2:15:23] <%RadicalEssay> hcfkk?
[2:15:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Kenny_Riot

[2:15:35] <Blodia2U> @RadicalEssay Yeah, that's it.
[2:15:42] <Kenny_Riot> It makes no sense! How do you do damage with it?
[2:15:45] <bang_camaro> vsav is hard but its also super fun
[2:15:49] <+Miller483> ^^

[2:18:21] <$konekoryugamine> I legit have no idea who to root for now
[2:18:24] <Blodia2U> @trinzec Demitri, Morrigan and maybe Sasquatch are good beginner characters
[2:18:36] <+Miller483> that's not a fun fact
[2:18:41] <$konekoryugamine> Octopimp is Homestuck Vidya Games with Nut Button
[2:18:43] <sagamin> it is for me
[2:18:43] <+Miller483> that MU isn't fun at all :(
[2:18:53] <$konekoryugamine> But Woolie is Castle Super Beast Scrublords
[2:18:56] <sagamin> hehehe
[2:19:07] <DSD24> "You established that you know how to play"
[2:19:09] <%Mattocat> Does MIller2B stand for Miller... too bad?

[2:19:48] <Megabyte114> hail and well met!
[2:20:01] <+Miller483> I didn't know Woolie was a "one more" guy
[2:20:12] <uncledoodsauce> hallelujah! woolie isn't playing indivisible, hotd, or astral chain for once!
[2:20:12] <%Ailerus> Ailerus is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel!
[2:20:13] <%Ailerus> Ailerus gifted a Tier 1 sub to SableS139a!
[2:20:14] <+Hagure> possibly? we've found the sound clip and its a pretty standard bite
[2:20:16] <%yeknomlive> it's the laugh in crash for the first boss
[2:20:25] <bang_camaro> green scream rules
[2:20:25] <%yeknomlive> that blue crazy guy
[2:20:27] <DSD24> I think everyone can be the "One More Guy"
[2:20:44] <spiegspikel> It’s like a Berserk panel
[2:20:49] <%Mattocat> this game actually is like, the worst because the matches happen so fast
[2:20:54] <%Mattocat> that you don't even realize how many you play
[2:20:55] <Arek_1> doodOne
[2:20:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> How does woolie just let reggie get away with that
[2:21:04] <%Ailerus> a 59 minute top 8
[2:21:07] <+Hagure> wow he's getting good at ESBC
[2:21:19] <+Miller483> no not the nunchuks
[2:21:28] <$konekoryugamine> Seriously, Woolie said he'd destroy Octopimp and then Octo said he was a CLOWN for trying to call him out
[2:21:30] <+Hagure> one day i wanna find uses for nunchucks
[2:21:35] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> reggie saying stick to showdown woolie
[2:21:41] <+Miller483> it's called trolling
[2:21:44] <%HDmexiqtioner> There's at one occasion Woolie wasn't a "one more" guy. lol
[2:21:47] <+Miller483> that's what the nunchucks are for
[2:21:48] <%Ailerus> DF ES nunchucks
[2:21:48] <+Hagure> *might* have a crappy use in the IAD matches
[2:21:56] <%yeknomlive> shit think
[2:21:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> SASQUATCH is when

[2:22:52] <+Hagure> no raptor
[2:22:53] <Megabyte114> like I despised him on site
[2:22:56] <%Mattocat> he also is the best grappler
[2:23:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> or is sasquatch just more viable
[2:23:19] <%Mattocat> Can I link it?
[2:23:21] <DedlokPM> Awoo rooOWO
[2:23:23] <%Mattocat> or does it ban me
[2:23:23] <%HDmexiqtioner> The phrase "Short hop the full length of the screen" seems like you're saying 2 opposite things
[2:23:24] <%yeknomlive> dam chat wat was that?
[2:23:25] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Miller483

[2:25:21] <%Mattocat> Talbain got deleted
[2:25:22] <%Ailerus> he's not in the game esteban
[2:25:24] <Megabyte114> Raptor is ok... basically I favor Felicia and Bishamon though (always favor by character first and formost)

[2:26:12] <+Okosisi89> This game is going so fast, and I can't make sense of the HP bars.
[2:26:13] <+Okosisi89> wtf
[2:26:25] <Blodia2U> Guess he doesn't know Sasquatch's supers either.
[2:26:35] <Super_Voltekka> That moment when you find out that Sasquatch's Dark Force with the penguins is literally Exploding Penguins 3: Total Annihilation
[2:26:42] <Thunderhog> THE BUTTONS
[2:26:53] <%TopLeftCenter> there's a white section on the lifebar but it doesn't show up on stream because of framerate stuff, the white part regens
[2:26:54] <Blodia2U> @Okosisi89 What don't you understand about the health bars?
[2:26:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> playing a grappler has to be hell in a game this fast doesn't it?
[2:27:03] <DedlokPM> @Okosisi89 green part is the life bar and it empties from middle to side
[2:27:14] <Blodia2U> Never mind, they're explaining it.
[2:27:16] <Puhff> Pat says Octo is gonna destroy you Woolz :3
[2:27:22] <MakotoFox> 33 raiders from MakotoFox have joined!
[2:27:22] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> no queen b rip
[2:27:28] <%Mattocat> okay so, damage on every move does permanent damage and recoverable damage. When you are in neutral, the white life begins to recover
[2:27:32] <Orenjevel> tapatapatapatap
[2:27:32] <+Miller483> ayy shoutouts to fox
[2:27:34] <+Okosisi89> aahhhhh
[2:27:53] <+Okosisi89> That plus the color choices was confusing at a glance.

[2:32:27] <jumbomanlive> hello everyone
[2:32:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm sorry reggie, i know you gotta be carried by the character
[2:32:39] <%yeknomlive> kingdom hearts 2 stage
[2:32:45] <%HDmexiqtioner> Is anything tournament illegal in this game?
[2:32:53] <+olemanjoey> Where is Luke?
[2:32:59] <+Hagure> there's a glitch with jedah that is banned
[2:33:11] <+Schiz_Turtles> @HDmexiqtioner Fetus of God stage
[2:33:17] <+Hagure> also a secret character only selectable in console version is banned
[2:33:27] <%yeknomlive> omg i was fighting jeddah on fetus of god and i couldnt see his attacks
[2:33:27] <%HDmexiqtioner> Fetus of god stage how?
[2:33:30] <Vanessa_Ui> Woolie talking about honor? kindleThink
[2:33:40] <MKII> silent button mod costs like $2
[2:33:40] <%yeknomlive> there's junk that covers the bottom of screen
[2:33:41] <+Hagure> fetus of god is waaaaay longer than other stages
[2:33:49] <+Schiz_Turtles> @HDmexiqtioner Esteban was saying it's longer than other stages
[2:33:49] <%Mattocat> it's basically a stage and a half
[2:33:56] <%HDmexiqtioner> ohhh
[2:34:02] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> HIS HEALTH
[2:34:13] <+Hagure> so it'd be a bad stage for characters like fish who rely on cornering you
[2:34:26] <SaintNubz> *furious button smashing*
[2:34:27] <%Ailerus> in super armor DF sasquatch can do full airchains off of a dash, it's super mean
[2:34:31] <SaintNubz> That's all I hear
[2:34:32] <+olemanjoey> This animation really is some of the prettiest sprite animation in gaming.
[2:34:42] <+Qsmash_> #shavesasquatch
[2:35:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh great jimmy's found his character finally
[2:35:18] <ThousandDogs> No fair, he's such a big cutie.
[2:35:28] <chronoxgp> ps1 had lots of storage, and capcom did 10's of thousands of frames
[2:35:28] <ThousandDogs> Comedy characters have to be overpowered.
[2:35:31] <%Mattocat> you can
[2:35:33] <+Miller483> yo send the invite
[2:35:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've been sitting here for the last 3-4 hours
[2:35:38] <%HDmexiqtioner> Playing Vampire Savior STOP Learning to play fish STOP Pressing buttons with fury STOP Piano inputs are piano STOP
[2:35:45] <%Mattocat> He's the main mascot
[2:35:51] <%Irridium> i been ready
[2:35:53] <%Mattocat> who the heck is Morrigan
[2:36:02] <bang_camaro> sas is chaotic good
[2:36:13] <%Ailerus> he just wants his bananas fam
[2:36:17] <Megabyte114> a much cooler character @Mattocat
[2:36:17] <chronoxgp> sassy
[2:36:17] <ThousandDogs> Just like in real life.
[2:36:23] <MichaelDood> Sasquatch lives in a society.
[2:36:25] <%yeknomlive> doesnt he like exterminate humanity in his ending or something
[2:36:32] <chronoxgp> samsquanch
[2:36:34] <+balouie> morrigan I would see is chaotic neutral
[2:36:44] <+Miller483> I think the biggest twist when I learned this game was learning how boring Morrigan was
[2:36:50] <+Miller483> compared to all her crossover appearances
[2:36:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sasquatch is the Teddy of Darkstalkers
[2:37:03] <Rojahh> But ain’t the real monster is man
[2:37:03] <chronoxgp> morrigan is a succubis
[2:37:05] <%Ailerus> DP kick
[2:37:07] <ThousandDogs> The cartoon had some fucking amazing moments, though.
[2:37:12] <Megabyte114> you mean how bored she is... with everyone else in the roster
[2:37:16] <Super_Voltekka> Sasquatch is from the Bigfoot race, who are all friendly unless you piss them off
[2:37:21] <+balouie> bbhood one of my favorites even though she is not good is probably chaotic evil
[2:37:21] <ThousandDogs> Morrigan was going for the correct accent.
[2:37:24] <Megabyte114> but then again, I use the OVA as my main reference so.. *shrugs(
[2:37:25] <%Mattocat> If you think Morrigan is cooler than Sasquatch, you're flawed
[2:37:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> why does sasquatch have slave anklets
[2:37:43] <+Miller483> if you think Morrigan is cool, you're flawed
[2:37:44] <%Mattocat> morrigan doesn't know how to Wark
[2:37:50] <Megabyte114> dude... EVERYONE ELSE IN THE GAME is cooler then Sasquatch
[2:37:51] <ThousandDogs> They're for decoration. Anklets.
[2:37:51] <+Miller483> (in this game)
[2:37:55] <+Schiz_Turtles> @balouie probably lawful evil, she takes contracts for money
[2:37:59] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> his dome
[2:38:00] <Megabyte114> there are some BACKGROUND sprites cooler then him
[2:38:06] <VJdarkworld> button ASMR :O
[2:38:13] <+balouie> but she will also kill whole families of monsters
[2:38:24] <+Schiz_Turtles> for money
[2:38:28] <ThousandDogs> Sasquatch: He's an Ice Dude once you get to know him.
[2:38:32] <Megabyte114> Anakaris in the USA cartoon is cooler then Sasquatch
[2:38:41] <thelovingfool> bb kills no matter if the monster is good or not
[2:38:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> bout to get bodied
[2:38:44] <%HDmexiqtioner> PS3?
[2:38:49] <DracaenaLeaf> yes
[2:38:52] <+Hoshikori0> I'm ready to get bodied!

[2:39:27] <%HDmexiqtioner> @Miller483 go gettem
[2:39:29] <+balouie> yeah she is quite probably the most evil character in the game

[2:39:40] <Megabyte114> possibly?
[2:39:42] <+Miller483> but the room's full

[2:56:41] <ThousandDogs> what the hell's a jump install
[2:56:41] <+Hagure> how much longer yall gonna be playing?
[2:56:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> real pupsnuffer hours, who up
[2:56:45] <zucchinibread> lionAustin
[2:57:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> jump install is "you buffering an actual jump off a move, usually a normal attack"
[2:57:02] <+Hagure> #AllCannonsAreBeast
[2:57:05] <%TopLeftCenter> unless you're Decapre
[2:57:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> or something to that extent
[2:57:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> someone correct me if i'm off lol (which i'm sure i am)
[2:57:41] <KaiGoesMoo> But Adon's whole life is jumping back and dive kicking
[2:57:42] <neozz13> Do you mean a jump cancel
[2:57:55] <chronoxgp> no such thing
[2:57:57] <+Hagure> its the same thing
[2:58:13] <+Hagure> just different terminology from different games
[2:58:16] <Arek_1> @Scege Abare? That refers to riskier play.
[2:58:17] <%Mattocat> Good shit esteban
[2:58:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yooo @Hagure i saw you often in the old super desperation radio streams!
[2:58:20] <chronoxgp> that would be an upper cancel
[2:58:27] <ThousandDogs> And chat once again gives every possible answer to the question.
[2:58:27] <bang_camaro> vampir21Segsquatch
[2:58:27] <neozz13> Okay because I’ve never heard the term jump install before
[2:58:40] <+Hagure> jump install comes from guilty gear
[2:58:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> god damnit

[3:09:25] <%HDmexiqtioner> What's the banned Glitch again?
[3:09:30] <Kenny_Riot> Woolie, Jedah is why the game is called, "Vampire Savior"
[3:09:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Infinite LUL
[3:09:42] <%Mattocat> isn't it Jedah's screen scroll glitch?
[3:09:43] <%yeknomlive> i cant see his moves on this stage
[3:09:55] <neozz13> Jedah is low tier
[3:10:05] <+olemanjoey> I'LL STOP WHEN I'M DEAD
[3:10:09] <%Mattocat> Raven from Guilty Gear is the better version of Jedah
[3:10:16] <+olemanjoey> vampir21Segsquatch
[3:10:20] <%mr_sups> Pretty much
[3:10:29] <neozz13> His worst problem is no sweep when he wants to control space
[3:11:04] <%Ailerus> donovan isn't very good afaik
[3:11:05] <@Menitta> CAPTAIN PICK BB HOOD
[3:11:08] <@Menitta> DAMNIT
[3:11:10] <%HDmexiqtioner> do Infinite inputs work for this Jedah?
[3:11:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Captain you had one job
[3:11:18] <%Ailerus> but vsav2 isn't very good
[3:11:22] <Kenny_Riot> Most of them, HD
[3:11:24] <BurdRightsActivist> Is this the guy who lost to Daigo?
[3:11:34] <biomegabear> The other one thats not Ran
[3:11:37] <Kenny_Riot> But he has moves in Infinite that he doesn't have here or in CFJ
[3:11:41] <Super_Voltekka> He's a walking JoJo reference
[3:11:47] <%Mattocat> But everyone is a grappler
[3:11:49] <ThousandDogs> Victor gives me Wonderful 101 vibes.
[3:11:59] <%HDmexiqtioner> HHH OHHH do the ASS CLAP GRAB
[3:12:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> DA BIDNESS

[3:12:28] <%yeknomlive> i like bbhood's command grab
[3:12:34] <%Mattocat> He just cannot
[3:12:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> the butt clap
[3:12:40] <%Ailerus> anak's guard cancel is punishable on hit as well
[3:12:44] <%Mattocat> Because fuck him
[3:12:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> GG
[3:13:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> i couldn't get the butter churning 720
[3:13:16] <neozz13> Which is why Ana is the worst character in the game
[3:13:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus lol, i bought this years ago
[3:13:22] <Kenny_Riot> I got in!
[3:13:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> after the friday night fisticuffs

[3:13:49] <@Menitta> I hope I can get a game in
[3:13:52] <+thedreampie> What version are yall playing?
[3:14:11] <BurdRightsActivist> Did anyone make the Plague joke yet?
[3:14:17] <%Mattocat> SamSho Jubei
[3:14:21] <+Miller483> Bishamon is so goddamn cool
[3:14:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> his fireball has a fucking rekka
[3:14:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:14:48] <neozz13> Daigo also was really good with BB
[3:14:52] <%Ailerus> just watch CB2019 top 8 you'll see why bishamon is great
[3:14:58] <%Mattocat> Bishamon would actually be a cool SamSho guest character
[3:14:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> and to pull off it's just pull towards you

[3:15:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus i'm sorry you want a more furry catgirl
[3:15:55] <thelovingfool> she'll wear nun costume for you
[3:15:56] <lotharaxe> She has too much cat imo

[3:17:36] <ThousandDogs> FELICIA CONFIRMED BASIC BITCH
[3:17:37] <xeros720> woolie's recommended tags: cat_ears+skindentation
[3:17:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> anything can be sexy
[3:17:41] <Snookasaurus> too much girl, not enough bee
[3:17:52] <%Mattocat> Bishamon is a really cute Armor Girl
[3:17:58] <zamzoph> @thelovingfool she's also butt, though. And also big beefers too
[3:18:04] <Super_Voltekka> She prances around in the nude despite being Catholic
[3:18:04] <%HDmexiqtioner> Have a good one Miller2B
[3:18:09] <thelovingfool> true, true

[3:23:22] <%Mattocat> no the cat is mid
[3:23:22] <%Ailerus> the cat does not hit overhead

[3:23:26] <+CaptainPyron> Hm... This Rikuo. He's curiously attractive... for a fish man.

[3:25:11] <xeros720> together they will build a village, in the corner
[3:25:16] <Kenny_Riot> so I just never bother using it

[3:25:34] <%Ailerus> Ailerus gifted a Tier 1 sub to Th3SmartAlec!
[3:25:43] <%Mattocat> The darkforce timer
[3:25:54] <%Mattocat> and recovery
[3:25:55] <%Mattocat> it's a risk
[3:26:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Ailerus Hey thanks!
[3:26:04] <%Mattocat> gaurd cancels and pushblock save everything
[3:26:04] <%Ailerus> it's not a TOD, it's super high damage

[3:26:39] <xeros720> HYPE DOG
[3:26:41] <%Ailerus> what's under the blanket???
[3:26:55] <%Ailerus> go to abaraya
[3:27:06] <dreamin_17> this has been a fun stream
[3:27:07] <%Mattocat> or if you knock them down
[3:27:11] <%yeknomlive> dont mind the blanket
[3:27:12] <%Mattocat> and they wake up and cannot block at all
[3:27:17] <%TopLeftCenter> If your opponent activates Dark Force and you land a hit into a knockdown then you also get a combo when they deatctivate
[3:27:19] <%Ailerus> you knock them down and pursuit afterwards
[3:27:28] <%Ailerus> that does a lot of damage to the timer

[3:28:15] <+dieselssb> was it mike ross?
[3:28:19] <Super_Voltekka> The armor is sentient and evil
[3:28:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> dudes didn't read the Tiamat Lore Guide
[3:28:43] <Kenny_Riot> I have the Darkstalkers "Data File" book right next to me

[3:29:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> RPGAyaya
[3:30:06] <DedlokPM> rooAYAYA
[3:30:06] <%Mattocat> Reggie definitely has the sense for what he needs to do here
[3:30:07] <速いカレー> wins with a furry in vsav, thinks you're a gawd Kappa
[3:30:07] <ThousandDogs> It is not correct to say that Reggie is bad at games. Give the dude his clout.
[3:30:09] <Serge_12> Who is Woolie and Reggie with?
[3:30:09] <DracaenaLeaf> Talbain is easy except for his ex zig zags
[3:30:44] <%Ailerus> when she deactivates her recovery time is based on how far away from the sister

[3:33:39] <Kenny_Riot> The size
[3:33:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> "Stage bigger than other stages"
[3:33:56] <+thedreampie> I thought it was too distracting
[3:34:04] <%Ailerus> @速いカレー not sure if i mentioned this but i really enjoyed your ECT commentary
[3:34:13] <neozz13> It’s longer because it’s Jedah’s stage and he was the boss
[3:34:19] <+rorschachsjournal505> That is a stupid reason.
[3:34:24] <felineki> It's one half screen longer. All the other stages are two screens wide, Fetus is 2.5 screens.
[3:34:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah that Blackheart Stage
[3:34:25] <+Qsmash_> Shuma Gorath's stage
