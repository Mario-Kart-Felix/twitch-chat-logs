Infinite Warfare looks neat, and Later Alligator was really charming. Haven't actually seen Helltaker gameplay, just a lot of art that's cute or otherwise lewd. Keep up the good work!

[0:07:23] <+linSP> THETE CAN ONLY BE ONE
[0:07:24] <tanarath> Woolie, I watched another stream who was getting a pc built after yours. chat basically doubled the cost of the upgrades she was getting, plus her fans surprised her with a chair + table.
[0:07:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:07:28] <+JeluxDaCasual> But WoolieVersus YT channel is older than WoolieGaming TY channel

[0:08:01] <%Exiliator> Is this like that WoW name fisaco thats been going on?
[0:08:02] <%Hawkbone_> Switch gimmicks, make him play fighting games and you play Risk of Rain 2
[0:08:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> i think that came across pretty clear
[0:08:12] <thatangryguyofde> In reality there was a second Woolie clone that wasn't eliminated
[0:08:14] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie gaming was just the jumping off for the convo
[0:08:15] <TigerClaws12> CSB moment
[0:08:20] <@Solidus_113> fact checking has ruined the podcast

[0:11:36] <%Hawkbone_> It was made to convince people to make porn, it is not in of itself porn
[0:11:37] <%ringabal> For every "Sephiroth van Northstar" baby born into this world, a Woolie must be named so that they may fight

[0:11:58] <+QueequegTheater> The secret ending is EASY

[0:11:59] <%ringabal> Let's not
[0:11:59] <@Solidus_113> all true

[0:12:05] <leroypi> There might be some handing holding but that’s the lewdest thing I can think of
[0:12:05] <%derap41> Saying there is a secret is a spoiler
[0:12:06] <Rikuo86> Game is a lot more wholesome than...a lot of the art around it.
[0:12:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's super short
[0:12:07] <+Dova573> its short woolz
[0:12:10] <%velemi> no its easy to get

[0:12:25] <Vashido22> an hour
[0:12:25] <RickSaintRiot> depends on how stronk your puzzler brain muscles
[0:12:26] <%Hawkbone_> The secret ending is the kinda thing you would actually literally never find without being told about it
[0:12:26] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL

[0:12:42] <+QueequegTheater> Guys it's Woolie doing puzzles, it's gonna be an endurance stream
[0:12:42] <Halospaz117> Length also depends on puzzle skills
[0:12:43] <%Lion_kun> But thats because you're bad
[0:12:43] <%chosenjuan42> Will you ever get the Later Alligator true endings?
[0:12:43] <DSD24> What happened?

[0:13:04] <+zooeymainbtw> no cap actually short
[0:13:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> I thought this was a puzzle game this might take a minute y'all

[0:13:22] <halfmasks> Nah
[0:13:23] <Mechazoic_Era> no
[0:13:23] <%ClericOfSparda> No
[0:13:23] <+craniusmaximus_> Helltaker is like... an hour or something. But nah, no NSFW
[0:13:23] <DSD24> Its all good
[0:13:24] <+Sleepy_Puma> no nudity
[0:13:24] <+zooeymainbtw> sfw
[0:13:24] <Solidnick18> maybe
[0:13:24] <%velemi> no he just wanted to INSPIRE
[0:13:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> You don't, he made it to bait people into making it
[0:13:25] <+0range_Boy> THE CREATOR IS VERY WHOLESOME
[0:13:25] <Tallie> no actual concerns
[0:13:26] <+Grizzytron> No, he banked on R34
[0:13:27] <%derap41> cleavage at worst
[0:13:27] <%Ranryu692> no, he did it to inspire fanart
[0:13:28] <OperatorPlease> it never goes beyond midriff
[0:13:28] <%skyheys> No porn, just bait
[0:13:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> He simply inspired the Rule 34
[0:13:29] <%Hawkbone_> Helltaker was made to get people to make more, it is not more
[0:13:29] <Skeletonmanners> the lewdest this game gets is one underboob
[0:13:32] <Vashido22> no NSFW
[0:13:32] <exnuart> cleavage
[0:13:33] <+zooeymainbtw> artist twitter on the other hand...
[0:13:34] <+MajorCrasher> @woolieversus off topic but have you played DRV3 yet, and if so what are your thoughts on it?
[0:13:35] <+LandOfTheWay> there is no NSFW content in this game
[0:13:35] <omrwael> it's only suggestive
[0:13:36] <%chosenjuan42> a s t h e t h i c c
[0:13:37] <+MetroidPrimeRib> nothing nsfw
[0:13:37] <+ChaosEmralds> he banked on artists
[0:13:37] <Flare3500> Just keep your other hand on the keyboard instead of your dick
[0:13:37] <+vexingsruzz> No, one demon girl shows some cleavage, but nothing explicit.
[0:13:38] <ZippierJosh> no there just really good designs
[0:13:38] <%ClericOfSparda> TWITTER FANART IS A WHOLE OTHER THING THO
[0:13:39] <RickSaintRiot> It's like seeding the rain-cloud
[0:13:40] <+ReiDuran> @WoolieVersus It's a Yoko Taro situation where he made it because he wanted OTHERS to make the porn
[0:13:42] <YakumoYomi> The game is safe, but the creator clearly wanted to inspire some rule34
[0:13:42] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:13:44] <+Ryaotz> a fair concern
[0:13:44] <Rikuo86> I don't know what people add the porn part, it's just demon girls in suits in general.
[0:13:45] <apiesdeathbylasers> game is fine. the fan art goes fucking wild tho
[0:13:46] <+Agentoracle> the game is entirely SFW. the lewd demon is wearing a turtleneck sweater.
[0:13:50] <+Wiithan6> based and demonpilled
[0:13:52] <%ringabal> Fellas, the time to be horny is not now
[0:13:54] <%Ranryu692> there is cleavage, but no naked boobies
[0:13:54] <RickSaintRiot> you put the waifu material out there... and the fans do all the work for you
[0:13:56] <DigitalJoshie> he's doing gods work
[0:14:01] <%KyoryUtchy> GAME ITSELF is SFW.
[0:14:01] <StarlitStunner> A noble goal zoneShrug
[0:14:02] <Tallie> its like the first bowsette art was very wholesome , then everything went next level
[0:14:04] <%derap41> Wasn't there a cartoon series with hot demons girls in suits
[0:14:10] <HotBloodedHero> Be horny after gaming hours pls
[0:14:11] <Vashido22> AND BOY DID IT WORK
[0:14:14] <+Bailey__gaming> @WoolieVersus did you catch the AMD announcement? also hope you are well
[0:14:14] <%derap41> and a Koala that kills people
[0:14:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> Not all heroes wear capes
[0:14:20] <+Masamune195> He held the door open for the porn. not made the porn
[0:14:22] <%jakefdaniels> coming in and hearing that made my brain see Woolie's sweatshirt as an ahegao sweatshirt
[0:14:22] <+bloodrune8864> He’s just getting people to make it for him

[0:16:14] <EndgameContent> Hollow Knight is better than any Castlevania game

[0:16:24] <+JeluxDaCasual> EX-Zodiac is "Fuck it, I'll do Starfox myself."
[0:16:26] <EndgameContent> So in a few years we might just get a better Titanfall
[0:16:27] <@Solidus_113> Ape Escape has been dead for over a decade FeelsBadMan
[0:16:27] <%Hawkbone_> Well I mean MegaMan X totally is dead
[0:16:27] <+klooswep> Yeah, I miss the Megaman X series Kappa
[0:16:30] <DSD24> @Combat_Data Oh man this speaks to me I loved those games
[0:16:37] <arikk42> There is nothing that could COME CLOSE to Jagged Alliance 2, Wollie. this game is too good and you know nothing about it.
[0:16:37] <+Viny_Mars> Or you just make a video about it and the devs/publishers get the hint
[0:16:38] <Solidnick18> one day
[0:16:43] <exnuart> megaman legends is still on the moon
[0:16:47] <%KyoryUtchy> ColossusCrash

[0:17:08] <+TopTieramisu> mega man zero series was a great followup to megaman x
[0:17:09] <Pappajimbo> canncled tv shows i mean
[0:17:10] <+JeluxDaCasual> Prototype Delta is "Fuck it, I'll do Mega Man X myself."
[0:17:13] <%derap41> Woolie Playing Psychiatrist for chat
[0:17:16] <%R0bobot> a lot of people made videos lauding Titanfall 2.
[0:17:17] <%Exiliator> mighty number nine? haHAA
[0:17:24] <%GenericSoda> There was some Bloody Roar-esque 2D fighter in the works a few years back
[0:17:25] <+jiggy_snipe> unfortunately a spiritual successor doesn't really work for a game narrative
[0:17:26] <Garry_Guyface> Megaman Command Mission 2 when? The anesthetics of that game were a holy grail
[0:17:27] <+JeluxDaCasual> Delta-Gal is "Fuck it, I'll do Mega man Legends myself."
[0:17:28] <DSD24> Chromehounds was so cool!
[0:17:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> Other bullshit being EA
[0:17:30] <omrwael> you know what franchise I really wanna see revived. Darkstalkers

[0:23:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SOLID
[0:23:18] <nmaten> the best one is the south park difficulty slider
[0:23:20] <RickSaintRiot> Most of them you cannot tell the silhouettes apart.
[0:23:20] <+Volttreb> Thats kind HEAT
[0:23:24] <dreadedcthulhu> casual, fsncy dress,, business casual, business formal, black tie
[0:23:24] <Zebroneath> That sounds like something Hitman should do.

[0:23:40] <+klooswep> Business fighter X
[0:23:44] <scrumbotime> There needs to be a lower level of clothing below casual

[0:24:09] <ZippierJosh> an assasin game with that idea would be cool

[0:32:32] <ScreamLord> Controller is easier
[0:32:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> It should work native
[0:32:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> did I arrive on time? did woolz already start the game? controller foibles?
[0:32:36] <+jv5_guy> or joy to key
[0:32:39] <@Menitta> steam controller
[0:32:40] <+QueequegTheater> @cosmicgoatee dude the game only exists because vanripper wanted more porn of his fetish
[0:32:42] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's weird that it's not working
[0:32:44] <%Hawkbone_> Oh my fucking god he's doing a hybrid keyboard and controller setup
[0:32:47] <$Nested_Dreams> Force steam input, but it requires a restart
[0:32:52] <+Taglog7> use an arcade stick
[0:32:53] <%Exiliator> yeah
[0:32:56] <dreadedcthulhu> @kosorsomesaykosm_ just in time
[0:33:01] <thatangryguyofde> this music is perfect for controller mishaps LUL
[0:33:01] <+patel347> yeah I think just restart the game or restart the controller
[0:33:02] <%derap41> Did you try turning it on and off again?
[0:33:02] <TopTierHarley> yea use an arcade stick lol
[0:33:03] <RickSaintRiot> Should be auto-success if you get to the end of the level.
[0:33:04] <$Combat_Data> Yeah, it's got native support
[0:33:05] <+zooeymainbtw> hmm weird
[0:33:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @dreadedcthulhu yaaay
[0:33:09] <Prevot> remember guys, while demon girls are okay, Helltaker is ABSOLUTELY NOT A FURRY
[0:33:12] <%GenericSoda> hell yeah play this with an arcade stick, just korean backdash your way through every puzzle
[0:33:18] <+Taglog7> use a DDR pad
[0:33:20] <%ringabal> "I'm in."
[0:33:20] <Brandon__Brando> ya just use a fight stick
[0:33:29] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus what about using an arcade stick
[0:33:30] <%Hawkbone_> Use a mouse for movement
[0:33:34] <cipher758> steering wheel woolie

[0:39:08] <Halospaz117> ... I did not know the spikes killed them
[0:39:15] <TopTierHarley> almost lol
[0:39:16] <Picia000123> And here we go
[0:39:18] <DigitalJoshie> im stupid and had a hard time on this one
[0:39:20] <@Solidus_113> wrong answers only
[0:39:25] <dreadedcthulhu> kill bottom on way back?
[0:39:25] <+doodoo_tummy> just go diagonal bro
[0:39:26] <SegaDSi> and it begins
[0:39:28] <@akuda_bar> yep wrong answer only chat
[0:39:30] <RickSaintRiot> Well, in this case, it would be a path going through as few spikes as possible.
[0:39:30] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:39:30] <+QueequegTheater> The shortest path between two points is kicking someone to death
[0:39:31] <dinnydanny777> This song is a banger
[0:39:32] <SuperFightinRobot> @derap41 A hole in space
[0:39:32] <exnuart> MORE TIME IN THE SPIKES
[0:39:32] <DigitalJoshie> took me a while
[0:39:33] <@Menitta> Indeed
[0:39:33] <Vashido22> SourPls
[0:39:34] <%Seancicle> pull the trigger
[0:39:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> The solution is to coom
[0:39:36] <%Seancicle> do it
[0:39:41] <@akuda_bar> solution is to get smarter duh
[0:39:41] <%skyheys> "dont worry about puzzle" time to worry about puzzle
[0:39:41] <+jiggy_snipe> just move faster Kappa
[0:39:42] <TopTierHarley> you did the same thing again NotLikeThis
[0:39:45] <%Hawkbone_> Why not just punch the lock?
[0:39:46] <%0rond> this game has a tendency to leave you 1 short for a lot of wrong solutions
[0:39:47] <Chaos_kun> Lmao
[0:39:47] <%gatorafan> STRIKE YOU FOOL! daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:39:47] <tired_fan> Pet the Gorls
[0:39:50] <$Combat_Data> You gotta kick them a little
[0:39:51] <ThorW> The Helltaker creator has a strong hustle. Can't find more art of your fetish? Make a game and trick people into making it for you
[0:39:51] <%Exiliator> woolieSPICE_TK
[0:39:53] <VJdarkworld> this why Fight Stick required for precise input Kappa
[0:39:53] <akman14> Use your devil trigger
[0:39:53] <%derap41> @SuperFightinRobot Been reading up on Penrose?
[0:39:54] <Solidnick18> coom chalice will help
[0:39:57] <exnuart> go below on the way back
[0:39:58] <Zebroneath> Woolie will figure it out
[0:40:05] <+vexingsruzz> What if you approach bottom dude from the other side?
[0:40:12] <stormhawk9891> O V E R T H I N K
[0:40:12] <niddron> please Woolie I haven't seen a cute girl in 83 seconds, I'm dying here.
[0:40:13] <@akuda_bar> answer is to kill the undead as fast as possible
[0:40:13] <Prevot> oh boy we gonna spend all day on just Helltaker
[0:40:24] <Chaos_kun> Quick mafs
[0:40:26] <%ClericOfSparda> You can do it, Woolie!
[0:40:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> puzle...bois...puzzle...bois
[0:40:26] <%blewbeary> helping in a puzzle game defeats the point of playing the puzzle game
[0:40:28] <%Seancicle> 👌🏻
[0:40:29] <leroypi> K I N G S H I T
[0:40:31] <@akuda_bar> solution is to pick the lock with your diamond hard demon boner
[0:40:34] <%cache_22> Skeletons hate walls.
[0:40:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> And there's the key
[0:40:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gears are turning
[0:40:38] <iosephe> Woolie figured it out...maybe
[0:40:43] <TopTierHarley> maybe lol
[0:40:43] <SnoopuRu> summon your stand
[0:40:45] <SuperFightinRobot> @derap41 Not in depth, but that much is intuitive.
[0:40:45] <Prevot> the solution is to love demon girls harder
[0:40:45] <%Hawkbone_> Climb the rocks

[0:54:48] <RickSaintRiot> Cannot Be Done
[0:54:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> She's a huge fan of most things that Sseth reviews.
[0:54:52] <dreadedcthulhu> come back around for the key?
[0:54:56] <DSD24> This is all vibe
[0:54:57] <%vextalyst> he had it last time
[0:54:58] <TopTierHarley> lol
[0:54:58] <brachydios777> I believe the Guy made this just because he thought girls in suits are hot, right?
[0:54:59] <dreadedcthulhu> u have like 40 moves
[0:55:01] <Zayasu> @chesterr01 yo reggie KonCha
[0:55:01] <arikk42> 43 moves is a LOT

[0:55:10] <%vaderxyz1970> Shes a big fan of heros 3
[0:55:14] <%GenericSoda> @Prevot the creator did a coic with her and she thinks FE is for casuals

[0:55:16] <%Irridium> @brachydios777 literally yes
[0:55:17] <%GenericSoda> comic*
[0:55:20] <dinnydanny777> @brachydios777 Girls in suits are hot though LUL
[0:55:24] <%Exiliator> woolieKICKDAD
[0:55:31] <brachydios777> I big agree though
[0:55:34] <tired_fan> @Prevot you speak the truth
[0:55:34] <+BigBusinessKaiju> The maker of the game runs a twitter that does Lore comics about the life of the Helltaker after the game.
[0:55:36] <TopTierHarley> 43 moves
[0:55:37] <+Javaa01> @vaderxyz1970 So you're saying she's a slav
[0:55:38] <%chll0ne> @brachydios777 most art is made to express a fetisu Kappa
[0:55:41] <RickSaintRiot> Can you smash enemy with rock
[0:55:42] <%bruuzer12> @brachydios777 Specifically demon girls in suits. He made this to spawn rule34 of his own characters
[0:55:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RickSaintRiot no
[0:55:51] <RickSaintRiot> If you can smash enemy with rock, problem solved
[0:55:54] <+patel347> remember theres a gap on left
[0:55:55] <+Mendin> The greates tof hsutles
[0:56:01] <Smitteys867> It would’ve been fun to see him play this with Reggie and/or Minh
[0:56:03] <OperatorPlease> you can't smash an enemy with a rock, no
[0:56:04] <Krakenoid> you gotta finagle the dingle into the good place for the question
[0:56:05] <+arancet> @BigBusinessKaiju any collection of them?
[0:56:07] <OperatorPlease> it has to be a kick or spikes

[1:06:06] <Rikuo86> Certain levels are designed so that you have EXACTLY as many moves as you need. The trick is to figure out which moves need to happen and which ones don't. Levels likes this punish you for excess movement. It's kinda genius really.

[1:08:25] <Equirah> only kill the guy to the left when you come to kick it up
[1:08:26] <cipher758> the framedata woolie
[1:08:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> I wonder what the process was for designing these puzzles that only have the 1 optimal solution
[1:08:28] <M0untain_wolf> Eyes aglow!
[1:08:29] <+patel347> ryth
[1:08:30] <gk1llah> no no no no
[1:08:30] <TopTierHarley> we already have @snoopuru LUL
[1:08:30] <huskarl_zap> IQ inflating
[1:08:32] <kulmoth> SWEATING INTENSIFIES
[1:08:34] <%skyheys> @snoopuru People just like to heckle, chill
[1:08:37] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> He sees the drop of water!
[1:08:37] <+Kiam117> what happened to othercide
[1:08:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Rikuo86
[1:08:40] <%MyNameIsRasus> IQ INFLATING AS WE SPEAK
[1:08:43] <halfmasks> @GeneralSCPatton he probably worked backwards
[1:08:46] <metabot64> could we just have a 10 hour stream of woolie dancing to the theme song?
[1:08:51] <gk1llah> ok this hurts good luck woolie
[1:08:52] <+itsgundamu> @SnoopuRu tempted to do that come back and Woolie is still on this puzzle
[1:08:52] <metabot64> instead of this
[1:08:56] <%Heavensguard92> He is beginning to B E L I E V E
[1:08:58] <Solidnick18> @Kiam117 he hasn't played it yet
[1:08:59] <+zooeymainbtw> @skyheys yeah sometimes people get too in their feelings
[1:09:00] <mortalmanbaby> woolie jsut dont think abotu the steps
[1:09:03] <+jiggy_snipe> only as his vtuber dancing
[1:09:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> big boi moves
[1:09:06] <%Ranryu692> get the key before killing the gjy
[1:09:07] <17sevens> it's just the nature of puzzle game streams, when you know the answer is drives you mad to watch somebody else not get it
[1:09:22] <rasamune> did woolie do advice for this round?
[1:09:26] <halfmasks> And Woolie has his own mind goblins
[1:09:28] <+bloodrune8864> Don’t go all the way down until you need to
[1:09:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he did
[1:09:31] <halfmasks> @rasamune he did
[1:09:32] <kulmoth> yes he did advice
[1:09:33] <%JuliusGemstone> yes he did
[1:09:35] <cosmicgoatee> woolies completely missing a pattern step
[1:09:36] <Smitteys867> He’s gotta kill the guy last
[1:09:36] <%skyheys> It's a matter of people who grew up on sokoban vs those who didnt, nothing more or less
[1:09:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieS woolieT
[1:09:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieF woolieU
[1:09:43] <%kingdovachief> kingdovachief subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Woolie you playing the devil games once again?
[1:09:43] <+patel347> rememmber you can
[1:09:45] <Chaos_kun> Will Woolie figure it out?
[1:09:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gotta admit I know I went through the game but I don't remember any of the solutions since it's been MONTHS
[1:09:51] <Rikuo86> You can't
[1:09:56] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[1:09:58] <%Hawkbone_> @FuqBoiSlim He Woolie'd it! PogChamp
[1:09:58] <Krakenoid> woolie can do it, he the bess
[1:10:00] <DianaTheAscian> Eventually
[1:10:03] <jojojingle7> Woo lie why are you kicking the guy down when your making yourself come back up anyway
[1:10:04] <eyedol33> That dancing pixel woolie is perfect for this game
[1:10:06] <Smitteys867> He’s overthinking it
[1:10:07] <EliahNebb> why does the music keep pitch-shifting?
[1:10:11] <Equirah> nooooo
[1:10:12] <%chosenjuan42> GivePLZ
[1:10:13] <%Exiliator> Boo how dare the audience during a live show cheer and jokingly heckle
[1:10:14] <VJdarkworld> @skyheys sorobans are hype
[1:10:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> PogChamp
[1:10:22] <cosmicgoatee> lmao
[1:10:28] <%skyheys> sokoban is the best
[1:10:29] <OkamiDude15> @EliahNebb its the twitch player messing up the game audio
[1:10:33] <17sevens> woolie's stuck in his own head
[1:10:34] <metabot64> maybe the girls hair is not short enough to motivate woolie correctly
[1:10:35] <superbla25> why is he backtracking?
[1:10:39] <rasamune> @EliahNebb That's Twitch, stop and start the player and see if that's helps
[1:10:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:10:39] <therealtacopancakes> key first because you are going back for it
[1:10:41] <Rikuo86> Ignore damge, get hot demon babes
[1:10:43] <+itsgundamu> ye but you wasted 4 turns trying to save 2
[1:10:44] <Equirah> nah it's over dude LUL
[1:10:48] <+merten0083> get the key first
[1:10:50] <EliahNebb> @EliahNebb thx
[1:10:51] <OkamiDude15> he's starting to believe chat
[1:10:55] <tired_fan> sooOOO CLOSE
[1:10:58] <DianaTheAscian> u did a version where u had 20 when u got the key idk how u did it @WoolieVersus
[1:10:58] <EliahNebb> @rasamune thanks
[1:10:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> You need like 10
[1:10:59] <%Ranryu692> get the key before killing that guy
[1:11:04] <halfmasks> let woolie figure it out
[1:11:04] <+hymao> Woolies bloodlust is getting in his way
[1:11:06] <%skyheys> I grew up on the mac ones, but the SNES boxxles are fun
[1:11:08] <Equirah> don't go kill the dude, you're too blinded by hate
[1:11:08] <SeBigBoss> why he kick stone he has to go later
[1:11:09] <%Asuterisuku> Do you have to kill the left undead right away?
[1:11:10] <eyedol33> Hes got it. Just needs refinement now.
[1:11:14] <tired_fan> HE IS THE ONE
[1:11:20] <Smitteys867> BOI
[1:11:23] <+bloodrune8864> You’re moving the bottom left block before you need to
[1:11:24] <halfmasks> he knows kungfu
[1:11:24] <kulmoth> he got the route, he just needs to refine it
[1:11:25] <%bruthabone> bruthabone subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months!
[1:11:29] <Krakenoid> woolie's thirst for the calcium is a problem but he can do it
[1:11:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is always the worst part tbh, you know 99% of the puzzle but that 1% is B I G
[1:11:33] <jojojingle7> Don’t worry about killing the guy I till after you have the key
[1:11:37] <%Axle13j> I think its like someone said - her hair just isn't short enough
[1:11:41] <DSD24> Thanks for the KPOPdance @bruthabone
[1:11:42] <Smitteys867> 🤐
[1:11:42] <Equirah> you'd need 10
[1:11:47] <razieltano123> 10
[1:11:50] <exnuart> 10 moves
[1:11:50] <SeBigBoss> not go way twice
[1:11:52] <cipher758> big sour
[1:11:52] <SeBigBoss> not go
[1:11:52] <Rikuo86> Did he ever try to kick the stone on the demon?
[1:11:53] <halfmasks> you think this LP would be better worse with someone else in the room?
[1:11:55] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[1:11:56] <+ReiDuran> Yeah you've basically got it you just gotta optimize
[1:11:58] <VJdarkworld> maths POG
[1:12:01] <+QueequegTheater> @halfmasks yes
[1:12:09] <therealtacopancakes> youyou have the solution, just get the key first
[1:12:20] <garbageheaphound> his brian is gonna melt on the lucifer one

[1:12:39] <%ClericOfSparda> This music makes up for the BS

[1:12:45] <BreakersAweigh> I spent so much time on this puzzle
[1:12:49] <+jiggy_snipe> @SeBigBoss no you were right, Farem = Foot Harem Kappa
[1:12:50] <%Hawkbone_> @SeBigBoss Is a Farem a Feet Harem?
[1:12:53] <Komayeda> I just used a walkthrough

[1:12:55] <%Hawkbone_> DAMMIT
[1:12:55] <+patel347> @WoolieVersus do work on spikes
[1:12:59] <Flare3500> cut the middleman and let's just google search fan art

[1:13:00] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:13:01] <Chaos_kun> Of course it’s horny, this game is about devils
[1:13:03] <%skyheys> Reggie would have beaten the game in five seconds because he's a degenerate who is down with sata woolieFABRICATION
[1:13:04] <Rikuo86> lol thirst trap
[1:13:04] <+Dionman19> calm down uys
[1:13:06] <eyedol33> This what I really liked about this game. I never expected the puzzles to actually be tough lol
[1:13:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> his bloodlust cannot be satiated
[1:13:09] <Equirah> restart it
[1:13:10] <kulmoth> you are wasting turns on backtracking to get the key
[1:13:13] <cosmicgoatee> wasted movement
[1:13:24] <+Dionman19> i know you all took an hour per puzzle
[1:13:26] <halfmasks> no lean into the spikes
[1:13:30] <17sevens> he's not seeing the obvious mistake, he thinks he needs to move the lower rock first when it's completely needless
[1:13:30] <Smitteys867> You have to take damage anyway, he’s spending too much time to kick the guy then backtrack up to the spikes
[1:13:31] <Komayeda> Thirsty, more like thirsty for any water because you're stuck here forever cuz you have no idea what ur doing
[1:13:31] <armchairmaster_> Just kick the rock twice to avoid spike
[1:13:34] <+NickHatesSnow> you can kick a wall
[1:13:38] <DianaTheAscian> optimize the spike damage
[1:13:42] <Johannen> Unoptimal movement tech, same problem for every game he plays)
[1:13:42] <SeBigBoss> @jiggy_snipe @Hawkbone_ 👀 great minds think alike

[1:32:55] <cipher758> Figure It Out: Endgame
[1:32:56] <Bloodhit> @Hawkbone_ They are Pancakes, unless you are NA or England, that what pancakes are everywhere like, and they not crepes.

[1:33:37] <%Hawkbone_> I skipped this one because I thought it was actually impossible, and then I thought that the whole thing with Judgement was punishment for skipping
[1:33:37] <Deadbulky> This is the hardest one by far
[1:33:37] <%0ctaeder> @ravencloak13 thanks for the information
[1:33:37] <TopTierHarley> Woolie pls
[1:33:38] <anthonys2596> This one took me the longest to solve
[1:33:46] <%kyh9> left again I think?
[1:33:52] <+zooeymainbtw> almost
[1:33:52] <brachydios777> Sheit
[1:33:53] <eldragon_1> I was here for a while LUL
[1:33:53] <+Frost_Quill> There's ONE trick to it that makes it easy once you figure it out. It's not something you'd think of immediately.
[1:33:55] <+That1blindkid> Justice is the embodiment of that "tomboy gf who works out with you and then tells you 'nice cock bro' in the shower"
[1:33:58] <+NickHatesSnow> this one is easily the hardest
[1:34:03] <+pkoffing> PACCCEEEEEE
[1:34:07] <+zooeymainbtw> I thought this one was super easy
[1:34:22] <BakerBrute> So many WEIRD moves in the solution
[1:34:24] <Vashido22> @That1blindkid the dream
[1:34:24] <%gatorafan> damn, chat is gonna get super exposed if Woolie crushes it
[1:34:26] <%Asuterisuku> How DID the Taker get in here anyway?
[1:34:26] <RealPT1> I had to look this one up but i was only missing two or three moves
[1:34:26] <+Frost_Quill> Justice has some DEEP LORE behind her character that's pretty interesting. And I don't mean the eyes thing.
[1:34:29] <%mistspade> Woolie are you checking life advice? It's important
[1:34:32] <$Combat_Data> Nah, this one is a huge problem
[1:34:39] <NotHereToStream> sometimes you should work from the end to the beginning for the solution
[1:34:40] <%thatsocrunchy> “Looks pretty rough.” *PROCEEDS TO PUNCH ROCK*
[1:34:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mistspade I think he got every one so far
[1:34:51] <%Hawkbone_> @Asuterisuku He asked the other Taker for help.
[1:34:54] <%mistspade> good
[1:34:58] <+Frost_Quill> I wonder if Woolie is gonna get the secret ending?
[1:35:01] <+zooeymainbtw> I think this is the 3rd easiest from personal experience, obviously different experience per person
[1:35:10] <eyedol33> It'd be sick if Woolie crushed this one but I'd have doubts of that with anyone.
[1:35:31] <Blaxel411> id love more of this game, but a full game of puzzles would melt me
[1:35:33] <+aishman> @Wolfwood315 Try not to push that middle one up, that seems to fuck you up big time
[1:35:37] <arikk42> Effed
[1:35:43] <tired_fan> Hit the left one to thr left
[1:35:45] <ScreamLord> Aww man, I missed him getting the Kamina demon
[1:35:45] <Megablueflash> Y'all acting like this is the hardest puzzle in history
[1:35:55] <cosmicgoatee> 33 moves for a reason
[1:35:57] <quesadiablo> this one is Very difficult
[1:35:57] <$Combat_Data> Secret ending well into "look it up" territory here
[1:36:07] <eyedol33> No but its difficult for this series of puzzles.
[1:36:10] <BakerBrute> @megablueflash keep in mind half the brain is distracted by hot demons.
[1:36:13] <arikk42> Effed
[1:36:25] <quesadiablo> last level tho
[1:36:34] <TheAmazingClaytor> @BakerBrute Half?
[1:36:35] <%chosenjuan42> More blood in brain stop thinking of demon girls
[1:36:41] <+aishman> Have to restart my dude

[1:36:46] <huskarl_zap> neurons activated
[1:36:46] <+RowenCleric> I cant not look at this game and think that its Kiryu, who is just lost and confused when these girls talk about sex
[1:36:47] <th3mavrick> Did he do the life advice?
[1:36:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> Effed
[1:36:57] <+zooeymainbtw> yeah he did advice
[1:36:57] <Megablueflash> Nah, I believe Woolie will get it soon
[1:37:03] <+Frost_Quill> @th3mavrick Yes.
[1:37:13] <th3mavrick> @Frost_Quill Dang, missed it

[1:37:42] <jorniev> is he gonna get the secret ending? ... probably not
[1:37:48] <+mercurylev> Probably not
[1:37:56] <quesadiablo> nope
[1:37:59] <OperatorPlease> the secret end is stupidly obscure
[1:38:04] <OperatorPlease> it's fine if you don't get it
[1:38:05] <@akuda_bar> woolie will figure it out
[1:38:06] <+Frost_Quill> I think Woolie is seeing that empty space as part of the wall?
[1:38:10] <+vieirat47> man, I hope woolie will figure it out.
[1:38:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Hint: You want the rock to the left of the key to end up in the top slot next to it.
[1:38:11] <+aishman> Nope
[1:38:12] <+Frost_Quill> Oh, nevermind.

[2:21:29] <%Shardlab> @Taglog7 Banish the banality of ntr. Revel in the decadence of harems
[2:21:32] <rockethed1> Vanripper has gone on record saying he made the game SPECIFICALLY to get people to make art of it

[2:21:35] <%vaderxyz1970> Judgement
[2:21:37] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus it's angel's bad end, you missed it
[2:21:38] <Daniel_Is_I> @WoolieVersus When you get Azazel, you choose her other option
[2:21:39] <+NickHatesSnow> if you tell azazel you want angels

[2:21:39] <+HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus you lie to azazel
[2:21:40] <Bloodhit> Different answer for Angle
[2:21:44] <SuperFightinRobot> getting all achievements is super worth it in helltaker. Just pick all dialogue options.
[2:21:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Choose wrong dialogue with the angel
[2:21:45] <Flare3500> It's like a jpg image thats it
[2:21:45] <+zooeymainbtw> just bad ending of angel
[2:21:51] <+sp_abadidea> Hope you're still in the mood for white-haired girls in black and red

[2:28:45] <alephalpha> it really si pandora mode
[2:28:46] <+jiggy_snipe> LUK
[2:28:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> I would listen to the Madworld Soundtrack on the way to school, it was a different flavor of edgy from the DeviantArt edge y'all had
[2:28:46] <%MyNameIsRasus> SUBTITLES UGLY DansGame
[2:28:47] <+zooeymainbtw> oof that did not look good
[2:28:48] <Daniel_Is_I> Subtitles for the text LUL

[2:29:08] <+jiggy_snipe> is something broken?
[2:29:09] <exnuart> aggressive subtitles

[2:29:12] <+JingKaisean> that text is tiny
[2:29:15] <%gatorafan> why does the text has subtitles? daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:29:16] <%FenixSeraph> INTO PIEcESE
[2:29:18] <Laironx3> this game wants you to do everything twice
[2:29:21] <+Mkingston> We heard you liked subtitles. So we subtitled your subtitles.
[2:29:21] <alephalpha> look at that ebhelit!
[2:29:22] <%FenixSeraph> THIS IS MY LAST RESORT
[2:29:22] <+HitchhikingThrough> what the FUCK is a compliance
[2:29:23] <%Irridium> watch the original size be fucking tiny
[2:29:27] <nailwind> PogChamp for bad eyesight
[2:29:27] <%ChoculaUltra> but if the whole game is red, black and white - who decided on bright yellow subs LUL
[2:29:30] <+Timmaahh97> SUFFOCATION
[2:29:37] <OkamiDude15> NO BREATHING
[2:29:43] <penitentpendant> Wait, the Subtital had more info?

[2:30:19] <+Superbro64> Cant read text on mobile DansGame
[2:30:22] <%ChoculaUltra> I still don't know how to feel when subtitles subtitle written dialogue thats on screen already
[2:30:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> eli?
[2:30:33] <nimu290> oh the game doesnt like woolies control scheme
[2:30:34] <%Asuterisuku> Subtitles for text is really weird.
[2:30:34] <%Irridium> wow I was right the original size is tiny as hell LUL
[2:30:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> DONT GJVE A FUCK IF I CUT MY ARM BLEEDING
[2:30:46] <%FenixSeraph> YOU NEED ME
[2:30:46] <@akuda_bar> @HitchhikingThrough were you actually asking what compliance is or was that a joke
[2:30:46] <DSD24> A lot of dead bodies

[2:31:01] <%FenixSeraph> Oh NOW I see why Woolie is interested
[2:31:02] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> NotLikeThis
[2:31:02] <alephalpha> look at that ebhelit
[2:31:11] <%Asuterisuku> Subs are fine for spoken lines though.

[2:32:33] <seaechiowai> woolieU
[2:32:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> ah, the aesthetic made me think it was more hack n slash or full character action

[2:33:16] <PraiseHemra> Mom a cool gal, don't afraid of anything
[2:33:16] <Prevot> xcom with bloodborne aesthetics
[2:33:16] <+Superbro64> So..
[2:33:23] <%Seancicle> I'm tripping
[2:33:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> Edgy Xcom with Waifus
[2:33:29] <+Superbro64> XxXComxXx then?
[2:33:33] <%thatsocrunchy> You must reach...THE EEEDDDGGEEEE
[2:33:45] <PraiseHemra> The lore is hidden in the codex
[2:33:53] <Flare3500> yeah pretty much xcom x bloodborne , the bosses could not shout bloodborne any louder
[2:34:10] <PraiseHemra> So its like the dark souls of xcom
[2:34:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> Pay for the whole seat but you'll only be using the EEEEEEEDDDGGGGGEEEE
[2:34:12] <OkamiDude15> watch the othercide korean stage play to learn the lore

[2:46:51] <pjbuster> indivisible I used the dpad
[2:47:47] <Flare3500> or in XCOM terms "Flanked"
[2:47:47] <PraiseHemra> flanking too
[2:48:21] <%thatsocrunchy> I remember holding off on shovel knight for the longest time cause I used joystick on my first run Kappa

[2:48:53] <alephalpha> bursting is useful when done well
[2:48:57] <alephalpha> but yeah
[2:49:01] <tanarath> Burst is high risk
[2:49:04] <+HitchhikingThrough> nice burst!
[2:49:05] <Flare3500> bursting is great but make sure you use all 100 AP
[2:49:13] <tanarath> but it can be clutch, too
[2:49:29] <%Exiliator> Mario stomp him LUL

[2:51:08] <Manwad> it gets super mean
[2:51:11] <PraiseHemra> oh it does
[2:51:21] <%ChoculaUltra> it plays well enough, some cutscenes might randomly explode with the scarf physics going everywhere tho
[2:51:25] <PraiseHemra> especially the bosses
[2:51:32] <Flare3500> You can only heal by sacrificing your unit , and it has to be the same level , so poggers
[2:52:04] <@Menitta> wasnt there a shinobi on 3ds

[3:56:32] <Flare3500> the boss is right there the guy in the background
[3:56:33] <spicyramengaming> I love the weapon designs, very minimalistic but also elegant.
[3:56:45] <%ClericOfSparda> It seems really good but over my head
[3:56:52] <Manwad> they do
[3:56:56] <alephalpha> enemy profiles have their exact behaviouirs
[3:56:58] <roarofdamnation> Did all the past podcast got deleted?
[3:56:58] <arikk42> If only Woolie would've gone the Jagged Alliance 2 route. he would go crazy.
[3:57:13] <roarofdamnation> broadcast*
[3:57:22] <alephalpha> it is definitely very nitt gritty
[3:57:38] <alephalpha> I totally feel the drowning aspect
[3:57:48] <spicyramengaming> From what I've seen of this game, it gets easier as you play it.
[3:57:48] <%Seancicle> twitter
[3:57:49] <tanarath> @woolieversus Enemy Codex Profiles have their exact behaviours
[3:57:54] <Flare3500> It's really fun in my opinion , you get a cooler character class later
[3:57:55] <alephalpha> Enemy Codex Profiles have their exact behaviours
[3:58:13] <+HitchhikingThrough> bail out
[3:58:23] <wicketpelican> The game locks one class so its not that complicated for a while.
[3:58:36] <wicketpelican> The next unlocked class is bonkers in high risk and high reward.
[3:58:39] <arikk42> it's the end right ?
[3:58:58] <wicketpelican> She uses a SCYTHE Woolie.
[3:59:13] <alephalpha> totehrcide smain issue from my opinion is just not ahveing enough avriety
[3:59:25] <wicketpelican> Also the biggest bad thing about this game is the damage values being so high it's hard to evaluate if your attack is enough or not to kill.
[3:59:30] <alephalpha> scythe dauighetrs ar eusper fun
[3:59:51] <$Spydurman> the art style makes it hard to read in a sense too
[3:59:57] <spicyramengaming> It just has an esoteric way in how it determines turn order.
[3:59:59] <redrins> things could be worded better
[4:00:04] <Flare3500> I didn't really pay attention to the tutorial , I played tons of XCOM , so my experience is from that
[4:00:21] <alephalpha> oh yeah it wa shard to understand like wait there's agap there
[4:00:33] <wicketpelican> Plus theres SO MANY BUFFS it's hard to keep track of. The gameplay goes around setting interruptions with Gunslinger and dealing damage with others.
[4:00:38] <blerrger19> I've played plenty of JRPG that heap on really dense tutorials
[4:01:09] <Flare3500> I feel like the game expects you to have played a handful of tactical RPG
[4:01:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:01:30] <%DappercatEsquire> Front loaded mechanic explanations make it real hard to get into new shit
[4:01:37] <alephalpha> ^
[4:01:59] <spicyramengaming> @WoolieVersus Hopefully you decide to stick with it, because it seems like there's a lot of potential fun to be had
[4:02:03] <wicketpelican> Plus the choosing of word of making something really metaphoric gets things confusing.
[4:02:06] <Flare3500> That's why FPS genre is always king , you move the mouse and shoot the thing
[4:02:37] <wicketpelican> Also the bosses have rythm and patterns to their turns and its mainly single hit kill.
[4:02:40] <arikk42> none of those games have any actual depth. unfortunately. But in jagged alliance 2. that's where a game goes infinitely deep.
[4:03:23] <Flare3500> You honestly did good Woolie , you lost only one girl , I lost like 2 in the early game and just threw them all the blender
[4:03:43] <spicyramengaming> I might just wear a mask all the time, even after all the COVID stuff.
[4:04:10] <%BinaryFireball> put food down, walk away
[4:04:15] <spicyramengaming> This was definitely a wake-up call to how callous and obnoxious people are about a simple act of courtesy.
[4:04:32] <exnuart> dude thats like 9/10 times with food order for me
[4:04:36] <wicketpelican> Woolie would you eat Ostrich neck?
[4:04:38] <exnuart> its so rare they leave it
[4:04:39] <+warlockwithapixie> Missed you playing Othercide, did you like it?
[4:04:47] <%hologram_sam> i bet they get dorks flipping on them for NOT handing it right to them
[4:05:04] <%hologram_sam> and those people can frig off
[4:05:11] <dots4eyes> Only time I really see people wear masks are inside restaurants and stores. Even then some people don't care. Meeeeeee...
[4:06:26] <spicyramengaming> It's just a shame
[4:06:27] <wicketpelican> Update about Brazillian pizza. There's is now a flat earther pizzeria that makes rectangular pizzas.
[4:07:26] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @wicketpelican
[4:07:34] <%BinaryFireball> people are bad at dealing with things that are much larger than them/don't affect them immediately
[4:07:34] <MadFoxOfGamez> Willful ignorance to problems is sad
[4:07:35] <spicyramengaming> I mean yeah, back in Feb/March, I could see the new normal being hard to adapt to, but its OCTOBER now. People need to get it together.
[4:07:43] <+jiggy_snipe> imagine not being able to adapt
[4:07:52] <tanarath> Mask wearing varies around here. People have to do it inside, outside they do it 50% of the time.
[4:07:55] <%BinaryFireball> I think tech might change that which is interesting
[4:08:03] <%BinaryFireball> with new tech every year
[4:08:08] <%BinaryFireball> always something new to learn
[4:08:14] <+DeltascapeV4> \o7
