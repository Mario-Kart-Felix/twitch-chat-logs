[0:52:41] <Man_in_the_Red> port forwarding is the future
[0:53:03] <Leonheart777> Those pants... are they related to Kim?
[0:53:42] <+twohitgood> fei long would have been cool in third strike

[0:59:14] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:59:25] <+twohitgood> @Bustahhwulf a lot of stuff needed more animation. there was a point with the game where character animations weren't even finishes and were just black and white sketches from keyframes.
[0:59:43] <Man_in_the_Red> oh, thats an Aja color pallete i can get behind
[1:00:03] <Bustahhwulf> almost fem vergil colors moon2H
[1:00:31] <+twohitgood> i like this game a lot because it's a game that loves fighting games. it's not that great of quality but it has a lot of heart.
[1:00:34] <+jbaker009> her buttons are giant compared to the rest of the cast
[1:00:52] <Quikanims> @Bustahhwulf more like ky kiske tbh
[1:01:34] <+jbaker009> like having damn I have this downloaded but can't figure out how to fix the video issues
[1:01:41] <+twohitgood> i always assumed aja was inspired by an under night character.
[1:01:52] <Leonheart777> What happened to the music?
[1:01:57] <+GenesisKnight> Wow, that low animation
[1:02:22] <+Dorf1> cant wait for the 3ds port of this

[1:10:17] <Ciriliko> Kreygasm
[1:10:36] <+twohitgood> you can juggle the uppercut a few times (i forget if it's 3 or 4)
[1:10:41] <+jackraiden23> Hey woolie, i wish you would explain things more in the "Get into fighting games" stream, feels like you're throwing out terms i h ave no idea what im looking at
[1:11:00] <TigerClaws12> literally a last blade character LUL
[1:11:01] <+thebadpope> This game looks so sick. Why isn't there a console port?

[1:11:14] <Man_in_the_Red> @thebadpope Nicalis
[1:11:31] <+twohitgood> @thebadpope it fell in with a bad crowd (nicallis) and fell out of getting support for it to be finished.
[1:11:34] <TigerClaws12> it's Hibiki LUL
[1:11:58] <+thebadpope> That sucks.
[1:12:05] <stormhawk9891> @TigerClaws12 If Hibiki was a charge character
[1:12:12] <+twohitgood> the game is awesome even in its unfinished form and if you like fighting games, you'll enjoy it.

[1:30:24] <+twohitgood> kinda 6...the other two are high and low parry
[1:30:41] <+twohitgood> but your attacks are like the snk 4 button variety.
[1:30:57] <%yeknomlive> are the parrys dual buttons or
[1:31:11] <%Wool> you have high parry and low parry
[1:31:14] <@Solidus_113> R1/R2 low high parry

[2:05:07] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[2:05:12] <@Solidus_113> that's the fucking stock shotgun sound from L4D
[2:05:18] <Ciriliko> What with the Spanish armada in the background?
[2:05:19] <Man_in_the_Red> @quikanims both are probably stoxk sounds
[2:05:26] <CasualAlohaFriday> It looks decent enough that it can go on my Steam wishlist.
[2:05:38] <+TopTieramisu> forget the armada, why are they guarding a steampunk house?
[2:05:40] <MojoKingIzakku> is that guy haggar with s stone paddle?

[2:07:23] <CasualAlohaFriday> @Ciriliko Maybe they're back to reconquer the Philippines? Probably that Conquistador-looking guy's stage

[2:10:27] <@Solidus_113> rip those sound files
[2:10:34] <californaya> I follow the dev on twitter, this is heavily based in Filipino folklore
[2:10:35] <+TopTieramisu> are they in tatooine?
[2:10:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> the models may not be the best but the fucking soundtrack and art is fucking amazing
[2:10:43] <CasualAlohaFriday> @paladinstarbuster Bayani. It's available on Steam for about $15
[2:11:00] <Ciriliko> $15??? uhg too much
[2:11:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> and even then the models are still colorful and fun
[2:11:07] <+S3xGAZEBO> Ah yes, the ancient filipino legend of Dr. Robotnic
[2:11:11] <+paladinstarbuster> @CasualAlohaFriday thank
[2:11:20] <+TopTieramisu> i think the big dudes look way better than the smaller dudes

[2:12:08] <@Solidus_113> Does fernando have a judgement cut?
[2:12:11] <NazarethSTG> Looks promising if they can polish it
[2:12:13] <+TopTieramisu> he's clearly standing in the air when he does that super
[2:12:19] <MaverickJoker> this is weird, watching a filipino fighting game being played by canadians as a filipino in the philippines

[2:13:01] <+TopTieramisu> i kinda wish they used that artist at the winscreen for the character select portrait
[2:13:26] <+S3xGAZEBO> It looks like he drew on his mustache with a sharpie
[2:13:31] <Ciriliko> A v a n c e
