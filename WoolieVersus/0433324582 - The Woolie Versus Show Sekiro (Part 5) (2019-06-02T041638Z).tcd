[0:08:39] <Bailey__gaming> Hi Woolie
[0:08:39] <gigacanuck> get stealth skill woolie
[0:08:44] <gunsrlove> That ability doesn't actually allow you to grapple enemies
[0:08:46] <Shishi1205> You should get 3 things

[0:09:38] <DianaTheAscian> did he beat snake eyes? i don't remember
[0:09:46] <alexandrecau> yes he beat snake eyes
[0:09:49] <PsychicKirby> Passive abilities in this game are actually worth if you have nothing else you're interested in funneling points into.
[0:09:54] <alexandrecau> took a while but he did
[0:09:55] <Shishi1205> He did beat her
[0:10:07] <cool_culainn> Sup

[0:10:51] <cobalt_phoenix_> did he get to the top of the castle?
[0:10:52] <@Solidus_113> Stairway
[0:10:54] <gunsrlove> Lazulite Shuriken makes it obsolete
[0:11:00] <alexandrecau> did he fight genichiro
[0:11:15] <gigacanuck> warm up time
[0:11:28] <alexandrecau> Last time I recall him trying to fight a headless underwater and then called it quit
[0:11:42] <DianaTheAscian> i dont think he did fight him
[0:12:12] <alexandrecau> he did meet Tengu though
[0:12:21] <cobalt_phoenix_> i dont remember him in mibu tho so how did he get underwater
[0:12:26] <DianaTheAscian> no
[0:12:33] <+NiktenKing> He still needs castle
[0:12:35] <Bailey__gaming> Tengu is pretty dope
[0:12:54] <gigacanuck> rooster slaughter
[0:13:00] <gunsrlove> Grapple swing isn't very impressive
[0:13:04] <+NiktenKing> Liam was doing the other thing
[0:13:13] <%MetroidPrimeRib> danna
[0:13:25] <Shishi1205> they want some of that salt
[0:13:42] <Bailey__gaming> did Woolie get tengus seed in the roof?
[0:13:44] <%Lion_kun> you know you could sell the money woolie and it'd be quicker
[0:13:46] <PsychicKirby> I think it goes without saying, but wanted to ask chat for confirmation. Whoolz no want spoil correct?
[0:13:47] <%linearlinera> Linearlinera subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! here's hoping minh sandbags harder and harder everyday
[0:13:51] <alexyaoilover> Why is Minh here ?
[0:13:56] <worldbrand> yaaaay hellooo
[0:13:57] <oyyzzo> why not
[0:14:05] <BabyNaBackbrace> Minh makes everything better
[0:14:06] <DianaTheAscian> @PsychicKirby yeah no spoil
[0:14:08] <%Lion_kun> Minh is the guide
[0:14:08] <%QueequegTheater> Man RE2 looks weird, but at least Pat got more handsome
[0:14:08] <Shishi1205> minh is giving moral support
[0:14:09] <+NiktenKing> Why not... he did a barebones run
[0:14:12] <+NiktenKing> he is the pro
[0:14:12] <%Lion_kun> and Sandbagger
[0:14:15] <+Weeewer> @alexyaoilover oh boy
[0:14:23] <Mendin> Minh is playing the role of Pat in this production
[0:14:31] <Parapattern> Woolie needs all the help he can get
[0:14:33] <Jetsfantasy> OOF
[0:14:42] <worldbrand> Plus the copilot system works really well
[0:14:51] <DianaTheAscian> Minh is woolies assist
[0:14:55] <Shishi1205> !Gameplay at risk!
[0:15:05] <+buttdirt> plus he adds diversity to the stream Kappa
[0:15:07] <+Weeewer> @worldbrand I thought it was pretty bad for RE2 simply because Pat knew too much and broke open all the mechanical secrets immediately :/
[0:15:12] <+Weeewer> But it got better as it went on
[0:15:14] <%Lion_kun> Bull got nerfed for Woolie
[0:15:21] <PsychicKirby> Mihn is just keeping Woolz on the rails is all. Help'n out, enjoying the game.
[0:15:28] <%MetroidPrimeRib> yes and some of the arts that require emblems got lowered too
[0:15:30] <Jetsfantasy> They nerfed Bull? Wow
[0:15:35] <worldbrand> You got a good point, I don't disagree
[0:15:43] <Shishi1205> Will it even appear?
[0:15:45] <valriot> Shame i was done with the game and sold it already
[0:15:46] <%ozzrabbit> @woolieversus I must apologize for my earlier donation. It wasn’t intended to troll you, and it was sent before you came on and I was unaware of your current predicament.
[0:15:47] <Shishi1205> yeah imagined
[0:15:47] <+Weeewer> In Sekiro it'll work better though
[0:16:05] <%MetroidPrimeRib> yes they nerfed bull and fixed a cheese on the first boss of the last area
[0:16:06] <Mendin> Press all the buttons
[0:16:08] <BabyNaBackbrace> I think Woolie's the only Twitch/YouTube channel that has'n't spoiled Sekiro for me
[0:16:20] <rad_dude123465> Has Woolie fought the guardian ape?
[0:16:25] <%MetroidPrimeRib> no
[0:16:31] <rad_dude123465> Noice
[0:16:31] <%half_awake1> half_awake1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[0:16:32] <%QueequegTheater> @rad_dude123465 LUL LUL
[0:16:42] <valriot> "Nerfed Bull" is like, blatant proof the game is poorly designed in so many areas
[0:16:50] <DianaTheAscian> i cant wait for the ape
[0:16:57] <%MetroidPrimeRib> bull is just shitty and the camera is the worst there
[0:16:57] <FackinCrazy> YOu need both
[0:16:58] <%QueequegTheater> Bull isn't badly designed at all tho
[0:17:01] <+NiktenKing> Bull wasn't even hard though...
[0:17:05] <PsychicKirby> Really I trust Whoolie will eventually find out the mechanics. If you read the tools and everything you begin to piece things together.
[0:17:06] <+Weeewer> Guardian Ape waiting room
[0:17:06] <%QueequegTheater> Just learn to use sprint
[0:17:06] <gigacanuck> remember how deadly the shield enemies are
[0:17:08] <Mendin> For those of us with poor memory, what did Woolie last do previously?
[0:17:11] <Jetsfantasy> I think adjusting bull is fair, tbh, it wasn't fun at all
[0:17:13] <%MetroidPrimeRib> bulls awful
[0:17:14] <Shishi1205> You should farm off stream b4 returning to the game so you get used to it maybe? if you have the time tho @WoolieVersus
[0:17:14] <0rond> bull is badly designed in my opinion
[0:17:15] <valriot> Hes not hard, hes just a shit boss
[0:17:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:17:18] <@Solidus_113> you're still at the start of the game, there's a lot of time to learn and get new stuff
[0:17:22] <JohnO_neil> That fight is gonna be straight up monkey business
[0:17:35] <0rond> he can be hard, and really different from everything you fought up till that point
[0:17:38] <valriot> He just does drifts and you slap his head, its boring and ass
[0:17:41] <0rond> and his hitboxes don't makes sense
[0:17:46] <PsychicKirby> yes
[0:17:48] <+Weeewer> Wrong
[0:17:53] <%MetroidPrimeRib> the camera just stops working during bull
[0:17:55] <+Weeewer> Ah thats what he means
[0:18:03] <+NiktenKing> Bull is just Gyoubu but without the fire ailment
[0:18:04] <gunsrlove> You get pleny of resources later
[0:18:06] <Parapattern> You get as much as you need as you go along
[0:18:07] <+Weeewer> I wouldn't say it's a 'commitment' you can use previous versions of the tool
[0:18:08] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You get enough resources throughout the game without grinding
[0:18:12] <+NiktenKing> or rather with the fire
[0:18:13] <VioletHeart> The grinding is reasonably painless. You do get a lot of resources later on.
[0:18:16] <gigacanuck> I don't know, Pat got the burning bull no deaths on his first try
[0:18:24] <VioletHeart> You might need to a *little* bit but
[0:18:28] <PsychicKirby> Resources will fall on top of you late game Woolz, no worries.
[0:18:40] <cool_culainn> I don't even really upgrade any of this
[0:18:44] <valriot> Did they "nerf" having every mini boss accompanied by 5-7 adds, cos boy, that gets fuckin old fast
[0:18:54] <%MetroidPrimeRib> upgrades are mostly useless
[0:18:55] <VioletHeart> I'd say if you don't grind at all you'll still be able to make out all but the last two collumns.
[0:19:05] <%QueequegTheater> @valriot No, just kill them
[0:19:10] <Bailey__gaming> when you get to later areas the enemy's drop so much
[0:19:12] <Jetsfantasy> By the time I finished my first playthrough, I got most of the unlocks. Not much outside grinding outside of last upgrades
[0:19:19] <Alloyed> for most minibosses you can just run around like a doof to kill the adds
[0:19:20] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus There is none
[0:19:21] <FackinCrazy> @WoolieVersus I think you need both paths to unlock
[0:19:21] <gunsrlove> There is no logic
[0:19:26] <+Weeewer> It is
[0:19:27] <primaryfire> you can see the upgrades for the tier just after the one you're on, so you didn't need the phantom kunai
[0:19:31] <gunsrlove> It's random
[0:19:33] <+Deuce_Willington> You want logic in your FromSoft Mechanics?
[0:19:37] <+Weeewer> Its not a linear tree, you're just unlocking new items
[0:19:42] <DianaTheAscian> r u asking for logic in a fromsoft game? @WoolieVersus
[0:19:44] <Bailey__gaming> I never ever used raven at All, I couldn't figure out how to use it
[0:19:52] <%MetroidPrimeRib> raven is good
[0:19:53] <VioletHeart> Raven's really good.
[0:19:58] <VioletHeart> Especially the later versions.
[0:19:59] <+Deuce_Willington> Raven is ok
[0:20:00] <josh813318> how far is he?
[0:20:02] <valriot> @queequegtheater Yeah, but my argument is that it wasnt fun and was just padding out the content by throwing more add spam thar Dark Souls 2
[0:20:04] <VioletHeart> But tbh all the late-game tools are great.
[0:20:04] <%MetroidPrimeRib> faster then a block if it's too late to block
[0:20:06] <%QueequegTheater> @Bailey__gaming It's essentially a parry that gives you a free dodge
[0:20:17] <Alloyed> free combat option :o
[0:20:17] <%QueequegTheater> @valriot DS2 doesn't have that tho
[0:20:19] <VioletHeart> A free parry, dodge, and extra effect all in one.
[0:20:20] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus don't forget to equip the new axe you just upgraded
[0:20:30] <%QueequegTheater> DS2>DS>DeS>DS3
[0:20:34] <+Nallex9> raven is super useful against bosses with quick posture regen
[0:20:57] <josh813318> ds2 is easily the worst of them
[0:20:58] <%Lion_kun> oooof
[0:20:59] <Bailey__gaming> Umbrella is best boi, hot question is Sekiros the best video game umbrella ever?
[0:20:59] <+Weeewer> DS3 my favorite one of those four LUL
[0:21:02] <%Lion_kun> the rust is real
[0:21:09] <CraZ80> when does stuff arrive in that box next to him?
[0:21:20] <%QueequegTheater> @CraZ80 It's for missed items
[0:21:24] <%jinking79> chance of Woolie finishing the game
[0:21:27] <+Weeewer> It heals your posture so its really good
[0:21:28] <valriot> DS2 gets hate, but a lot of it is justified
[0:21:37] <%QueequegTheater> Not really
[0:21:45] <CraZ80> @QueequegTheater missed items?
[0:21:48] <%QueequegTheater> 95% of it is "but no Miyazaki tho"
[0:21:50] <VioletHeart> You get so many tokens by the end of the game.
[0:21:55] <VioletHeart> I had over a thousand left over.
[0:21:58] <josh813318> it might have gotten better after the dlc but base ds2 was the worst one
[0:22:01] <%QueequegTheater> @CraZ80 Any missed key items end up in there IIRC
[0:22:01] <zecht89> don't care, ds2 still my fave
[0:22:04] <valriot> Yes really. You fuckin need a stat to have a roll that functions properly
[0:22:09] <CraZ80> oh
[0:22:12] <+Weeewer> lmao
[0:22:17] <DianaTheAscian> ds2 isnt a amazing souls game but still a fun video game still
[0:22:22] <%QueequegTheater> @valriot That's why I didn't say 100%
[0:22:24] <+Taglog7> whose watching GOT tomorrow? Kappa
[0:22:33] <josh813318> ya it's not bad just not as good as the rest
[0:22:33] <VioletHeart> Shuriken's great.
[0:22:36] <FackinCrazy> ds2 sotfs is probably as good as base 3
[0:22:38] <+Weeewer> Not Woolie LUL
[0:22:45] <VioletHeart> I wanted to like the spear but it's not amazing.
[0:22:48] <+Weeewer> I actually liked episode 4 except the Euron/Danerys thing
[0:22:48] <BabyNaBackbrace> I'm watching GoT reactions on monday
[0:22:51] <CraZ80> @Taglog7 NotLikeThis
[0:22:52] <%QueequegTheater> @Nina96 apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong That's a BS excuse that people use because they don't have legitimate criticisms
[0:22:57] <valriot> But thats like one issue with DS2. Hitboxes alone in 2 make it pretty poor
[0:22:59] <+Weeewer> Episode 3 though...no kind words
[0:23:05] <+Taglog7> WutFace BibleThump
[0:23:11] <MihajloMBlood> Nani? Woolie not using the Mist Raven? The defense-turned-offense with Fang & Blade? What universe are we in?
[0:23:12] <Calek> all souls games have poor hitboxes
[0:23:16] <%QueequegTheater> DS2 has better hitboxes than either DS or DeS
[0:23:24] <%MetroidPrimeRib> ds2 has about 30 bosses and about two of them are good
[0:23:32] <@Solidus_113> wait, you have the upgraded firecrackers, use them instead of the base version
[0:23:41] <DianaTheAscian> @QueequegTheater or its when i don't have a stick up my ass
[0:23:43] <BabyNaBackbrace> DS2 also has the worst hitboxes in the series
[0:23:51] <snow_bush> DS2's weapon combos were great. Shame that the Cestus got nerfed after it
[0:23:53] <josh813318> not being able to see how the scaling dmg changed ion weapons in ds2 when you upgraded was annoying
[0:24:06] <josh813318> ds2has a lot of boring bosses
[0:24:14] <valriot> DS2 has the hitboxes that both hit you when they shouldnt, and dont when they should
[0:24:15] <NaturalGear> DS2 hitboxes are unquestionably bad lol
[0:24:23] <josh813318> roll stat was annoying
[0:24:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:24:27] <gigacanuck> TFW Ornstein with no Smoug
[0:24:41] <%QueequegTheater> @Nina96 No, because it is a good Souls game. Saying "It's a good game but not a good Souls game" iss a meaningless statement
[0:24:52] <valriot> Its not like, "oh the Black Knight has a bih hitbox" its get fucked full screen mid roll
[0:25:02] <+Punchasaur> Mist raven turned Owl into a bitch for me
[0:25:04] <BabyNaBackbrace> Textures and models are often a step backward in comparison to DS1
[0:25:14] <gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Beyond Gun lady and continue in Caste, those are the two
[0:25:17] <%QueequegTheater> "This Souls game is a good game but I want to bitch about Miyazaki not jizzing Siegmeyer fanservice all over it"
[0:25:21] <josh813318> de spawning enemies unless you are in a certain covenant was bad
[0:25:22] <%MetroidPrimeRib> ds2 is straight up ugly
[0:25:27] <%MetroidPrimeRib> that mist forest lol
[0:25:30] <BabyNaBackbrace> DS2 wound up being an OK imitation of Souls
[0:25:34] <%MetroidPrimeRib> ps2 game tier
[0:25:34] <%VJdarkworld> Dark souls is the greatest souls-like ... but bloodborne is greatest souls game 😏
[0:25:38] <valriot> Miyazaki made this game, and its a 7/10
[0:25:45] <%QueequegTheater> DS2 is a better Souls game than DeS or DS3
[0:25:51] <bibleianblack> what brought DS2 up?
[0:26:07] <bibleianblack> also are their levels extremely fucking low for anyone else?
[0:26:12] <valriot> Cos someone wanted to say DS2 was the best in the series again
[0:26:12] <%VJdarkworld> Dark souls 2*... i honestly think if it was a spin off alot of the hate wouldnt of been extreme
[0:26:13] <bibleianblack> audio, that is
[0:26:15] <GundamF91> Bro ur on crack if DS2 is better than DS3
[0:26:24] <DianaTheAscian> @QueequegTheater i never said ds2 wasnt a bad souls game i said it wasnt jaw droping amazing souls game
[0:26:25] <@Solidus_113> mics are very low, yes
[0:26:29] <Calek> mics are fine
[0:26:34] <PsychicKirby> It's all good
[0:26:35] <+NiktenKing> fine
[0:26:35] <Calek> turn your volume up
[0:26:36] <CraZ80> these souls games need an easy-mode Kappa
[0:26:40] <gigacanuck> Souls games were never good
[0:26:42] <valriot> HBomber got nuked from orbit, the argument for DS2 died with him
[0:26:50] <%QueequegTheater> @GundamF91 Oh yeah I guess if you wanted DS1 fanservice without an actual story you would think that
[0:26:50] <josh813318> i think @QueequegTheater is just to invested in his opinion
[0:26:57] <BabyNaBackbrace> DS2 is the only one I can't even force myself to play through again
[0:26:58] <KeiPrime> kite fellows
[0:27:02] <bibleianblack> i'm playing through ds2 again with friends and i know that part of the problem is that playing with 3 people is hell, but also the gamefeel is way worse than 2
[0:27:06] <bibleianblack> er than 3
[0:27:19] <bibleianblack> also @WoolieVersus can you turn up your mics?
[0:27:33] <FackinCrazy> Mic is fine
[0:27:44] <Shishi1205> mic is fine for me too
[0:27:47] <valriot> Game feel is 2 is 100% worse, everything feels like its sliding around
[0:27:53] <%supersugoisenpai1> Good sneak attack
[0:27:58] <+buttdirt> you fucked him good tho
[0:28:07] <DianaTheAscian> i dont see a problem with the mics
[0:28:11] <NaturalGear> Hey, I whiteknighted DS2 against some BS criticism too, but I still thing it's the weakest Souls to date
[0:28:12] <bibleianblack> huh i was just in someone else's stream before this which is what gave me the impression that this is really quiet
[0:28:20] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel helped me come to terms with the death of my uncle. So maybe I get a bit fucking defensive when people use any excuse they can to delegitimize it as "well I guess it's okay but it's not a REAL Souls game because Miyazaki's name isn't in the director slot"
[0:28:28] <%MetroidPrimeRib> I feel bad killing the old ladies in this game
[0:28:34] <bibleianblack> also the fact that i'm playing isaac on 1/1 volume on the side and can't hear them at all
[0:28:42] <Mendin> There's a small chance that Woolie's webcam microphone is picking up audio instead of headsets, if things are quiet
[0:28:42] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yeah those ladies don't even do anything
[0:28:43] <bibleianblack> er. i can hear but not understand
[0:28:50] <valriot> I dont care about Miyazaki, half his ideas are stolen from Berserk
[0:28:51] <%QueequegTheater> @BabyNaBackbrace They alert the others
[0:28:54] <%VJdarkworld> The dks2 engine feels great for pvp, but sluggish for pve. If it didnt have the awful soul memory i would invade in it more
[0:28:56] <@Solidus_113> It's always been really quiet, I always need bump the audio track like 5-8 Db when editing them for youtube
[0:29:05] <valriot> DS2 was just rushed and badlt designed
[0:29:24] <josh813318> Lucatiel was a cool character
[0:29:38] <Calek> DS2 still has the best NG+ mechanics, and DS3 for whatever reason kept the equip load/stamina split but the slower level scaling made it worse
[0:29:41] <snow_bush> Best souls wife
[0:29:43] <DianaTheAscian> i forgot Lucatiel existed
[0:29:47] <RiceeFTW> poison got mad buffed
[0:29:48] <BabyNaBackbrace> Lucatiel, the only actual character
[0:29:49] <Bailey__gaming> @woolieversus hugbthe wall where they were after you kill them
[0:29:55] <BinaryShuffle> 死
[0:29:56] <FackinCrazy> @valriot Eh Berserk is mostly shit taken from norse and european mythologies and hellraiser
[0:29:57] <resloxxx> Here we go
[0:30:02] <+buttdirt> LOL
[0:30:02] <%QueequegTheater> @Nina96 "Remember my name" "...Nah" LUL :(
[0:30:14] <alexandrecau> battle cry now death cry
[0:30:28] <Guktar> every npc has the same arc in souls
[0:30:41] <valriot> DS2 is still a 7/10, but the idea its not a messy as fuck game in really bad ways, as opposed to "framerate is rough here"
[0:30:44] <%MetroidPrimeRib> I had to look this up
[0:31:08] <bibleianblack> i like that every souls game is different enough that people can make good cases for why each one might be their favorite
[0:31:18] <DianaTheAscian> ture
[0:31:18] <valriot> Bed of Choas still worst boss in the series though
[0:31:20] <bibleianblack> but it also means there's no definitive experience
[0:31:24] <gigacanuck> eat the sugar woolie
[0:31:24] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:31:28] <gigacanuck> EAT THE SUGAR
[0:31:44] <primaryfire> are they using the blue yeti? I feel like I hear vibrations when they talk
[0:31:56] <gigacanuck> so what makes the ladies so dangerous?
[0:31:59] <Parapattern> Mistake
[0:32:05] <CraZ80> has Woolie fought a Headless yet?
[0:32:10] <primaryfire> the ladies alert the others i think
[0:32:10] <+thackattack00> Ladies alert enemies iirc
[0:32:11] <%VJdarkworld> Grandmas are powerful
[0:32:16] <DianaTheAscian> yeah he did but lost
[0:32:17] <FackinCrazy> @gigacanuck sounds fine to me
[0:32:21] <valriot> I mean favourite game is subjective as hell. But im purely talking about DS2 objectively
[0:32:37] <snow_bush> Who else fights lady butterfly as their fisrt boss?
[0:32:43] <DianaTheAscian> me
[0:32:52] <bibleianblack> Dark Souls Remastered is a very good way for people to experience the game for the first time though, and even though oh no some of the small touches were not understood and were changed, but still
[0:32:55] <Calek> you get nowhere arguing that DS2 is objectively bad
[0:33:02] <%Padridis> WE LIVE YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEY
[0:33:05] <%Padridis> woolieYE
[0:33:10] <Mrbaconator> objectively DS2 is not great as a souls game. subjectively it's my favorite one exclusively because of how power stance works
[0:33:12] <DianaTheAscian> big back down
[0:33:12] <bibleianblack> for anyone who isn't already deeply ingrained in the lore and shit it's a great game
[0:33:21] <BabyNaBackbrace> I like the idea of new Souls players to start on 2, then play 1 and 3
[0:33:25] <bibleianblack> DS2 has some good variety
[0:33:40] <DianaTheAscian> is started with 2 than 3 than 1
[0:33:42] <Mendin> DS2 has Actual Dual Cestus goodness, plus the Dragon Bone Fist
[0:33:53] <NaturalGear> I actually liked the Throne of Want as a concept in DS2
[0:33:56] <Mrbaconator> that's an awful idea because of quality of life
[0:33:57] <+RayDaug> DS2 does a lot of things well, but it's encounter design, which is the most important part, is a mess
[0:33:58] <DianaTheAscian> god i cant type today
[0:33:59] <gonvern15> @babynabackbrace thats how i started
[0:34:01] <Mrbaconator> i think people should do 1 2 3
[0:34:11] <valriot> I enjoyed DS2, Sunken City was really great, and the pre-nerf shitfire had a lot of build potential
[0:34:12] <Mendin> 2 1 3 imo
[0:34:12] <bibleianblack> it also has "oh i'm rubbing up against the model of the pyromancer in the lost bastille, but i can't actually hit it from this angle with my caestus despite practically being inside its model"
[0:34:19] <RiceeFTW> sabimaru is crazy after the poison buff
[0:34:23] <bibleianblack> it has the hippo demon vacuum grab
[0:34:37] <worldbrand> the proper solution is to snip your ethernet cable and play them in release order without patches
[0:34:43] <BabyNaBackbrace> @gonvern15 was 2 a good setup for the story of 1?
[0:34:44] <DianaTheAscian> DS2 fixed DS1s bad ui
[0:34:56] <bibleianblack> DS2 is 2 steps forward 5 steps back
[0:34:58] <Calek> also added more than four directions to rolling
[0:35:00] <Mrbaconator> ds2 also lets you pop multiple use items at a time doesn't it
[0:35:05] <Calek> while locked on
[0:35:24] <NaturalGear> @bibleianblack That's the best way to put it
[0:35:42] <alexandrecau> my blood that brings people from the death is not sacred, says privileged child
[0:35:42] <valriot> Every game has strengths ans weaknesses, Bloodbornes blood vial and bullet shit is so stupid i cant even begin, but the game is a 10/10
[0:36:01] <zanzibarian_hamster> @valriot Divine Confetti
[0:36:25] <valriot> This game has by far the most issues for me, as a Souls game, i prefer DS2
[0:36:30] <DanM745> hey woolz!
[0:36:32] <valriot> "Souls"
[0:36:35] <ProVaxxer> Billy's ruining this fucking playthrough
[0:36:36] <%Padridis> woolieOMG
[0:36:40] <Mendin> This isn't a soulsgame, is the kicker there
[0:36:56] <valriot> I mean more FromSoft game but yeah
[0:36:57] <DianaTheAscian> i never struggled with blood vials maybe because i played mh so having to constantly get healing items never notherd me
[0:37:02] <VioletHeart> It has elements but it's hard to stick in the same group as a Soulsborne game.
[0:37:03] <gonvern15> @babynabackbrace my first play though was back when woolie and pat started theres so i don’t really remember
[0:37:09] <NaturalGear> I would totally ascribe Sekiro as a Soulsborne
[0:37:13] <worldbrand> it changes things up so much that yeah, i wouldn't lump it into soulsborne
[0:37:26] <@Menitta> Could you imagine hearing intense combat music in real life but there's nothing near you
[0:37:35] <alexandrecau> die grandma
[0:37:36] <RiceeFTW> Sekiro is Techu Wrath of Soulsborne
[0:37:39] <FackinCrazy> @RupanSen The combat system is almost completely different
[0:37:40] <@Menitta> How horrifying that'd be
[0:37:42] <RiceeFTW> *tenchu
[0:37:42] <Mendin> Real intense combat music that's mostly flute and violin
[0:37:56] <Mendin> Souls-Adjacent by virtue of same developer is about
[0:37:57] <bibleianblack> Sekiro is great until the final stretch because the final 2 bosses are, I'm going to say, actually unfair
[0:38:00] <Tucker0603> Ds1 had a better story to me, but despite some mechanical issues in 2 it had a lot of improvements
[0:38:17] <gonvern15> @menitta when that happens you got something inside you attacking you
[0:38:18] <%VJdarkworld> Dont give woolie tha SPOILERz
[0:38:21] <BabyNaBackbrace> I have the Hotline Miami 1, 2 and LISA soundtracks for walking around music
[0:38:26] <valriot> @nina96 My issue with blood vials and bullets is that theres no reason to have them be limited, when you can only ever carry a set amount anyway
[0:38:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:26] <+Deuce_Willington> It's an action/stealth game made by someone who's only concept of videogame conventions is Souls games
[0:38:30] <Calek> I really like DS2's story, probably the most outside of bloodborne
[0:38:31] <DianaTheAscian> i enjoyed the ds2 hub more than ds1 or 3
[0:38:32] <@Menitta> Just walking down the street and suddenly "NOW FIGHT A NEW RIVAL"
[0:38:35] <primaryfire> is a cat purring into the mic or is it just the blue yeti vibrating on the desk?
[0:38:39] <NaturalGear> @FackinCrazy It's structured like a Soulsborne tho
[0:38:41] <%MetroidPrimeRib> spoilers if you give Emma enough sake you can fuck
[0:38:44] <RiceeFTW> @bibleianblack I disagree, I thought they were really fair but just fairly difficult, which makes sense given context
[0:38:54] <Mendin> Fromsoft made other games besides souls, you know
[0:38:59] <%VJdarkworld> Deracine is the greatest souls game
[0:38:59] <Mendin> like Lost Kingdoms
[0:39:00] <DianaTheAscian> @valriot yeah that makes sense
[0:39:02] <Mendin> and Metal Wolf Chaos
[0:39:10] <worldbrand> There were one or two bosses in this game that i screamed "that's bullshit" at while dying to them, but after i beat them i totally don't feel that a single fight is unfair
[0:39:26] <valriot> This games version of bullets is like, actual dogshit, its anti-fun because you cant experiment without farming for the secondary item currency
[0:39:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> Having blood vials being limited but if you are out you get ~10 as a freebee would have improved the game a shit ton
[0:39:30] <bibleianblack> maybe it's just that i haven't been able to beat the final boss yet
[0:39:39] <bibleianblack> for reasons that i cannot get into without risking spoiler territory
[0:39:45] <VioletHeart> Saying that, while BB's grinding was a pain, there are ways to make it effortless.
[0:39:48] <@Solidus_113> IT'S THE BOY
[0:39:50] <Tucker0603> when the hell is the port of Metal Wolf Chaos gonna finally get here?
[0:39:55] <VioletHeart> Some locations drop blood vials and bullets by the dozen.
[0:39:55] <bibleianblack> YEAHHHH HERE'S THIS GUY
[0:39:57] <worldbrand> Hahahaha this guy
[0:39:57] <%MetroidPrimeRib> big dick Iaido boy
[0:39:57] <valriot> And then you go experiment, and die and lose hakf your money, its so fuckin dumb
[0:39:58] <RiceeFTW> @valriot by the end of the game I had too many spirit emblems to even care, didn't even have to farm ever
[0:40:00] <+robobeau> This fight is rad\
[0:40:00] <Calek> oh hey the easiest mini boss in the game
[0:40:06] <BabyNaBackbrace> This is a fun fight!
[0:40:07] <Mendin> Devolver posted recently saying ...eventuasoonish
[0:40:09] <bibleianblack> JINSUKEEEEEEE
[0:40:13] <DianaTheAscian> @Tucker0603 never will
[0:40:23] <Mendin> WE REAL IAIDO NOW BOYS
[0:40:23] <%VJdarkworld> @valriot not really. Its cheap af
[0:40:29] <%jinking79> gotta watch that hand movement
[0:40:29] <gigacanuck> hello, Vergil
[0:40:33] <%MetroidPrimeRib> it's called Iaido when you draw and cut extremely fast
[0:40:41] <juxtest> He has exactly one move, but its a pretty good one
[0:40:46] <+dheng1> There’s a gimmick to him
[0:40:47] <VioletHeart> Not quite one but
[0:40:48] <VioletHeart> basically one.
[0:40:49] <gunsrlove> he spams the same thing
[0:40:50] <+Deuce_Willington> To master the ultimate technique, you must forget all others
[0:40:52] <+dheng1> You got it woolz
[0:40:57] <+C4ligula> Iai'd yo ass.
[0:41:02] <%jinking79> almost have to mash this one
[0:41:04] <gunsrlove> deflect spam and you win
[0:41:04] <VioletHeart> He also has an unblockable slash and a hilt poke but it's almost entirely that double slash.
[0:41:07] <NaturalGear> If you sidestep him he can't hit you
[0:41:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> E I E Iaido'd
[0:41:23] <VioletHeart> But you really should deflect him.
[0:41:28] <valriot> @vjdarkworld But my point is why even bother limiting the uses of the sub weapons to begin with, if you can only carrt X amount on each shrine sitting?
[0:41:29] <+robobeau> WHOLESOME LANGUAGE
[0:41:30] <BonzoBeanMachine> batoujutsu is all about the unsheathing blade
[0:41:31] <VioletHeart> Since it does so much posture damage.
[0:41:32] <KeiPrime> wow
[0:41:33] <+Deuce_Willington> WOOLIE, YOUR MOTHER IN LAW!
[0:41:33] <gunsrlove> Kenshin can EAT SOME FUDGE YOU MEAN
[0:41:37] <+korth367> RUDE
[0:41:39] <Shishi1205> Grandma is right there woolie
[0:41:40] <gigacanuck> Judgement Cut Judgement Cut Judgement Cut
[0:41:46] <DianaTheAscian> WHAT HAPPeND TO WHOLESOME!?
[0:41:49] <GoldeNOVA> Kenshin was a real dude, he doesn't deserve this
[0:41:51] <+ademes57> Batojutsu and Iiajutsu are different naes for the same technique in Japanese swordplay
[0:41:57] <Tucker0603> Iaido is my favorite style when it comes to using the katana
[0:41:59] <%HRDSalami654> Woolie is a weeb confirmed.
[0:42:03] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @bibleianblack
[0:42:07] <worldbrand> after i hit like 300 spirit emblems i dont think i ever fell below that point
[0:42:07] <+ademes57> it depends on the timeframe
[0:42:12] <KeiPrime> kenshin manga is pretty baller tho all thigns considered
[0:42:13] <%Psyramics> he deals damage through guard!
[0:42:16] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie! Language! Your mother-in-Law is here!
[0:42:18] <worldbrand> but i do think the emblem economy is super weird, especially considering the upgrades only give you +1
[0:42:18] <bibleianblack> no Woolie! that's eXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS
[0:42:19] <@Menitta> oof
[0:42:21] <+C4ligula> That sheath swag.
[0:42:22] <Shishi1205> parry guy
[0:42:24] <KeiPrime> saito is the shit
[0:42:32] <Mendin> "That looks sidesteppable" *is in Sekiro*
[0:42:32] <%Psyramics> you can't guard him, you have to deflect
[0:42:38] <%jinking79> Vergil a dead beat dad
[0:42:39] <valriot> Same issue with blood vials/QSB, youre only gonna carry 20...why have them be limited, when youre always gonna drop in with 20
[0:42:40] <VioletHeart> Sidestepping in Sekiro is for cowards.
[0:42:41] <tri3dgE027> Dude going Vergil on your ass
[0:42:48] <+dheng1> Show your royal guard skills
[0:43:01] <Tucker0603> gotta Orochi deflect him
[0:43:03] <FruitopiaFred> Now thats what I call BIG damage
[0:43:04] <big_chugnus> I had a dream last night you uploaded a RE2 episode titled, "last one for a very long time"
[0:43:21] <RiceeFTW> HE WAS READY
[0:43:21] <Graxe_> Yeah
[0:43:23] <Graxe_> That
[0:43:24] <Mendin> "So I have bad news... Ada and Leon are no longer friends"
[0:43:29] <VioletHeart> Hey Woolie, there's this mechanic called deflection in this game...
[0:43:29] <BabyNaBackbrace> That'll learn ya
[0:43:30] <Tucker0603> FUCKING REKT!
[0:43:32] <Graxe_> He can get you on wakeup
[0:43:37] <NaturalGear> @VioletHeart Ninjas are the ultimate cowards tho
[0:43:42] <PsychicKirby> I know how I beat him, but I'm not sure if it was the "intended" way.
[0:43:43] <@Solidus_113> and this is an enemy you CAN'T skip. the fog wall is there until you beat him
[0:43:43] <Djinnazz> He’s an Asshole
[0:43:44] <valriot> Theres the part where i just ignored this boss
[0:43:45] <VioletHeart> Jokes aside this guy *is* a skill wall. He's tough.
[0:43:50] <DianaTheAscian> @valriot limited in usage or refill after re spawn?
[0:43:50] <%MetroidPrimeRib> iaido style is unbeatable
[0:43:51] <tri3dgE027> While Woolie is practicing Third-Strike. Dude has been studying the gam
[0:43:52] <+Weeewer> Mihn is anti- Pat
[0:43:53] <+Weeewer> confirmed
[0:43:55] <+NiktenKing> I honestly died to this guy more than the actual boss
[0:44:00] <tri3dgE027> *blade
[0:44:05] <+buttdirt> this guy's also a mini tutorial/refresher
[0:44:06] <%VJdarkworld> @valriot theres a hidden thing that does fix that issue (🤫) but yeh, it is too limiting normally.
[0:44:06] <Shishi1205> you can get one of his pip by stealth right?
[0:44:10] <big_chugnus> F
[0:44:15] <Blank9> Woolie will find his own shinobi way
[0:44:17] <worldbrand> you can?! i never tried that
[0:44:20] <VioletHeart> I don't think you can stealth this guy.
[0:44:22] <sarg1010> No @Shishi1205
[0:44:23] <%MetroidPrimeRib> I dont think u can
[0:44:24] <VioletHeart> He activates the moment you step in.
[0:44:24] <RiceeFTW> the battle against the camera never ends
[0:44:33] <+Deuce_Willington> "You cannot pass until you learn this lesson" describes a lot of bosses in this game and I love it
[0:44:35] <Graxe_> I've never gotten a stealth hit because he's sitting facing the door
[0:44:36] <sarg1010> This guy is a "how good are you at parrying" check tbh
[0:44:37] <Shishi1205> k, I thought you could
[0:44:39] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> You can only stealth him if you use the stealth candy
[0:44:42] <+Weeewer> Sekiro camera is more rough than the other souls games which already got wacky cameras
[0:44:47] <valriot> @nina96 Both. Theres no reason to have limited consumables if youre only gonna carry X amount to begin with.
[0:45:00] <%MetroidPrimeRib> the camera is good when you are outside
[0:45:07] <%MetroidPrimeRib> next to walls like this and bull it sucks
[0:45:07] <BabyNaBackbrace> Man I almost never use firecrackers
[0:45:09] <worldbrand> that's actually laughable
[0:45:10] <+Weeewer> @sarg1010 I beat him by just running left, he couldnt hit me >_>
[0:45:12] <+Zayasu> why is the camera so close? cirSlain
[0:45:20] <gunsrlove> just delfect spam, forget sidestepping
[0:45:25] <PsychicKirby> @Weeewer Similar
[0:45:28] <tri3dgE027> Some enemies...you just need to let them kill themselves
[0:45:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:45:28] <NaturalGear> This guy is actually a one-trick pony, you can circumvent that
[0:45:32] <VioletHeart> I really don't recommend side-stepping or dodging.
[0:45:37] <+buttdirt> camera becomes retarded in indoors close quarters
[0:45:37] <big_chugnus> Use the shield
[0:45:39] <valriot> Im not walkin into Ludwig with 40 blood vials. Im always gonna walk in with 20, unless i run out, which just means i have to go waste time getting more
[0:45:42] <%MetroidPrimeRib> you pretty much have to deflect this guy
[0:45:48] <%MetroidPrimeRib> it does a ton of posture dmg
[0:45:50] <apostateCourier> the dodge button gets you killed more often than not
[0:45:51] <+korth367> no side steps
[0:45:51] <sirrice77> side step left works fine
[0:45:55] <+korth367> stop dodging
[0:45:58] <VioletHeart> The lesson of this fight is that "deflecting attacks wins this video game"
[0:46:00] <gunsrlove> just deflect
[0:46:01] <energywarning> stand and deliv... deflect
[0:46:01] <+Deuce_Willington> This is the learning process
[0:46:10] <Graxe_> This was the fight where I was like, "Okay, Mist Raven, let's see what you can do."
[0:46:11] <+Caped_Eggy> I fought this guy by only dodging
[0:46:13] <DianaTheAscian> @valriot the 20 limit is so u dont spam it and never fell in danger as for the ones in storage that ones unnecessary
[0:46:14] <big_chugnus> Vergil colours
[0:46:17] <+dheng1> Woolz gotta learn the hard way
[0:46:22] <BabyNaBackbrace> This boss and the next really get you into deflecting
[0:46:24] <RiceeFTW> this is a game of clashing swords and Woolie is trying to dodge like it's Dark Souls LUL
[0:46:25] <@Solidus_113> blocking still does a lot of damage to you
[0:46:27] <+dheng1> He got this
[0:46:29] <sirrice77> yeah idk what you guys are saying dodging works perfectly fine when you get the timing
[0:46:34] <RyuuAoi> WE STILL IN THIS BITCH
[0:46:42] <VioletHeart> Fun fact. His hilt-poke is one of the weakest attacks in the game.
[0:46:46] <%MetroidPrimeRib> you can kill this guy in 20 seconds with parries though
[0:46:46] <NaturalGear> there we go
[0:46:55] <%supersugoisenpai1> Dodging left is how I beat him, can't get that parry timing
[0:46:57] <+NiktenKing> @BabyNaBackbrace Unless you were unfortunate enough to meander into gunfort...
[0:47:00] <ibrahimo505> Weakness points
[0:47:03] <bentheshrubber> look for the flash
[0:47:10] <%jinking79> watch his hand best time to parry
[0:47:10] <DianaTheAscian> clutch
[0:47:12] <Shishi1205> one down
[0:47:14] <+robobeau> @WoolieVersus There's a later boss that is basically this dude x 10. So learning to parry him is very useful
[0:47:21] <gunsrlove> whoops, armour
[0:47:22] <+Deuce_Willington> Once you learn the parry timing on his double attack, this guy goes down in 5 seconds without you breaking a sweat
[0:47:24] <@Solidus_113> shhh
[0:47:30] <valriot> @nina96 Yeah...but if youre only gonna have 20, why have the ability to run out to begin with? thats my point, the only thing that changes between unlimited blood vials like Estus, and limited it, is farming them back and wasting time
[0:47:35] <+anime_boyz> use firecrackers as a defense instead so use it right before healing to prevent getting punished
[0:47:37] <+Deuce_Willington> But Woolie must learn this on his own
[0:47:40] <BabyNaBackbrace> @NiktenKing is that the Snake eyes?
[0:47:48] <+bloodxletter> DONT DODGE JUST DEFLECT
[0:47:49] <+buttdirt> damn you handssssss
[0:47:53] <snow_bush> He on NG+?
[0:47:54] <big_chugnus> Just don't get hit @WoolieVersus
[0:47:57] <VioletHeart> Woolie will learn the power of Royal Guard.
[0:47:59] <+SvenHolgersson> Summon your innner Boruto @WoolieVersus
[0:48:02] <+dheng1> Let him learn boys
[0:48:04] <PsychicKirby> Gotta un-learn the learning.
[0:48:06] <%jinking79> learn n kill
[0:48:07] <%Solidnick18> hello guys woolieSMUG
[0:48:09] <+dheng1> He’ll get it
[0:48:09] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:48:10] <PsychicKirby> It's cool
[0:48:11] <Quilltaz> believe in your ninja way woolie
[0:48:16] <+robobeau> It's just a small suggestion D:
[0:48:19] <FackinCrazy> God damn mormons coming to my door trying to give me god or someshit
[0:48:21] <@Solidus_113> an hour in already? damn
[0:48:28] <Whiteonyx981> I remember Liam basically got this guy on his first try
[0:48:33] <%HRDSalami654> Woolie will be the next Hokage!
[0:48:33] <juxtest> De-alive him instead of getting cut up
[0:48:33] <BabyNaBackbrace> I like how this game teaches you to just care about winning
[0:48:35] <Tucker0603> just use Black Prior's Bulwark counter Kappa
[0:48:42] <KumaTorey> woolie is a stubborn one i see simHmm
[0:48:51] <+dheng1> Show him your nindo way woolz
[0:48:51] <DXLelouch24> we all had to do this chat it's only fair to let him suffer
[0:48:51] <%HRDSalami654> He just has to follow his nindo.
[0:48:56] <Suneater_Jerome> Fucj Ashina up Woolie!!
[0:49:00] <worldbrand> at first, you know, i thought woolie wasn't respecting this guy enough. "what if i try firecrackers?" but seeing him do this the hard way is cool
[0:49:02] <Suneater_Jerome> sweep the leg
[0:49:07] <+Deuce_Willington> Woolie fights with honor
[0:49:09] <Mendin> Woolie will need to figure it out if he is to stand any hope against "That Man"
[0:49:11] <PsychicKirby> GET HIM IN YOUR YOMI
[0:49:27] <worldbrand> he can feint?!
[0:49:32] <juxtest> Using shurikens to force him to draw is pretty clever
[0:49:35] <RiceeFTW> i've actually never seen that animation before
[0:49:40] <big_chugnus> F
[0:49:40] <RiceeFTW> is that his deflect animation?
[0:49:45] <DianaTheAscian> @valriot so u would have rather had a estus system than?
[0:49:49] <%MetroidPrimeRib> its 2nd bar only
[0:49:49] <+Epic_Skeptic> This is my favorite fight in the game
[0:49:54] <VioletHeart> Yeah this fight is great.
[0:49:56] <%MetroidPrimeRib> the feint
[0:50:08] <DianaTheAscian> that sheath though Kreygasm
[0:50:14] <0dokuro> 100% Woolie is doing it the harder way, but I believe in him.
[0:50:14] <+Deuce_Willington> GREED!
[0:50:15] <PsychicKirby> Getting there
[0:50:16] <BabyNaBackbrace> This is the first From game that I use oil bottles frequently
[0:50:21] <worldbrand> yeah i've never seen that feint animation
[0:50:22] <+BelieverBill> Deflect, deflect, deflect
[0:50:23] <valriot> @nina96 I mean blood vials are the estus system, except they run out for no reason other than "go grind more"
[0:50:25] <%MetroidPrimeRib> greed
[0:50:25] <DXLelouch24> there's 2 ways to beat him, the easy way and the hard way,Woolie chose the latter
[0:50:37] <+dheng1> You got greedy woolz
[0:50:40] <+dheng1> Lol
[0:50:41] <DXLelouch24> so did i, it wasn't a fun time
[0:50:47] <GundamF91> Ironic that Dark Souls knowledge makes you worse at this game
[0:50:49] <+Deuce_Willington> I'm enjoying watching him do it the hard way
[0:51:02] <FackinCrazy> So wrong
[0:51:03] <+Deuce_Willington> @GundamF91 This
[0:51:06] <Blackjackal95> not really a dark souls type of deal at all
[0:51:09] <RiceeFTW> exactly, the B (or circle) button gets you killed in Sekiro often
[0:51:14] <VioletHeart> The fact this game *feels* familiar but really isn't is one of my favourite parts. It makes playing it a pain but so much fun.
[0:51:22] <0dokuro> oof
[0:51:23] <+Zayasu> cirSlain
[0:51:23] <KumaTorey> cant wait for after all this Then be told how to make this fight trivial. woolie jebaiting himself
[0:51:24] <nerdblase> The easy way and the acquiring skills to make hard things easier in the future way.
[0:51:26] <DianaTheAscian> BIG F
[0:51:28] <PsychicKirby> oof
[0:51:31] <Tucker0603> F
[0:51:33] <VioletHeart> And I replayed Bloodborne lately and... guess what? The parry timings translate well enough. I forgot how to dodge in BB but could parry everything.
[0:51:37] <Quilltaz> this enemy is anime lvl powerful with his swordsmanship
[0:51:39] <+Deuce_Willington> "Darsouls, but everything you know is wrong"
[0:51:44] <FackinCrazy> @RiceeFTW Honestly I found that jumping away was almost alway more useful
[0:51:51] <NaturalGear> It isn't really the hard way, he's just not completely committing to it
[0:51:53] <worldbrand> fromsoft taught you how to fight wrong as a joke
[0:52:02] <0dokuro> This guy is also a good sign of the things to come for you.
[0:52:05] <gigacanuck> DEFLECT E F L E C T
[0:52:14] <RiceeFTW> @FackinCrazy agreed, but this game rewards relentless offense and perfect deflects, it's a game of dancing swords
[0:52:18] <big_chugnus> Just don't get hit
[0:52:20] <%jinking79> the Fear get to ya
[0:52:22] <+BelieverBill> Time it , time it, time it...
[0:52:22] <captainnathaniel> umbrella is your friend here
[0:52:23] <+Deuce_Willington> @worldbrand loled at that
[0:52:25] <valriot> I mean this isnt exactly a fight, most enemies you can just stand still and either LB, or Jump
[0:52:25] <+dheng1> I have faith it will click for him
[0:52:29] <Blackjackal95> tcelfed
[0:52:29] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:52:31] <FackinCrazy> @RiceeFTW 100%
[0:52:33] <PsychicKirby> We must break down the Woolz and build him back better, stronger.
[0:52:45] <DianaTheAscian> is woolie taking chip or is he just messing up the parry?
[0:52:49] <0dokuro> Woolie must learn through punishing
[0:52:51] <%MetroidPrimeRib> he did it he jumped
[0:52:52] <TrashLeviathan> seeing this game makes me want play for honor
[0:52:56] <+Deuce_Willington> He's just not parrying
[0:53:00] <%MetroidPrimeRib> woolieCHAN
[0:53:03] <+Deuce_Willington> Or only Parrying once
[0:53:06] <worldbrand> PogChamp
[0:53:08] <VioletHeart> @Nina96 This guy deals damage on a block. Only a perfect deflect is safe.
[0:53:23] <0dokuro> Has he fought O'Rin? I'm assuming not.
[0:53:26] <big_chugnus> Spawncamped
[0:53:26] <VioletHeart> Which is why he's such a wall a lot of the time.
[0:53:28] <+WzillNJ> the meaty
[0:53:29] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Stay down
[0:53:31] <Blackjackal95> I don't think he's caught yet that you can deflect both swings
[0:53:36] <RiceeFTW> @Nina96 I'm not 100% sure, but I think you also take more damage if you miss a deflect
[0:53:37] <+dheng1> Spawn camped
[0:53:38] <DianaTheAscian> @VioletHeart oof i forgot he did that
[0:53:39] <+dheng1> Lol
[0:53:48] <%VJdarkworld> SPAWN CAMPER
[0:53:50] <Tucker0603> guy looks like he's Mitsirugi when he's doing those short hops
[0:53:57] <juxtest> Gotta let him cut that rust off
[0:53:59] <+tearfuldevil> so wrong
[0:54:12] <0dokuro> You had it!
[0:54:17] <VioletHeart> @Nina96 Honestly I didn't realise he did chip damage until this stream.
[0:54:19] <%jinking79> must make that fear Submit
[0:54:25] <PsychicKirby> Got to learn that t - t -t -timing~
[0:54:30] <KumaTorey> i thought i was horribly stubborn on fights in games. i have been outclassed by woolz LUL
[0:54:50] <big_chugnus> This is like Vs'ing a high rank Yoshi in Tekken
[0:54:50] <Aydarkzero> Woolz is maximum stubborn
[0:54:52] <worldbrand> that was a good shuriken
[0:54:53] <0dokuro> I'm just waiting for that sweet O'Rin fight.
[0:54:55] <DXLelouch24> parryings the intended way so gitgud
[0:54:57] <FackinCrazy> There you go
[0:54:58] <+Deuce_Willington> oooo, good shiriken
[0:55:04] <DianaTheAscian> @VioletHeart i beat him first try so i never saw much of what he does
[0:55:08] <%VJdarkworld> I got freaked out by the chip dmg too so i didnt even realize he could be parried
[0:55:09] <valriot> Honestly think deflect makes this game dull, theres barely a reason to engage, just block at the right time
[0:55:16] <+Weeewer> Intended way hehe. Do whatever it takes is my souls game strat
[0:55:17] <VioletHeart> Beating him first try is pretty impressive.
[0:55:19] <+Sabre_Basilisk> does he have the jump counter unlocked?
[0:55:33] <Romuken> oooooh i see now
[0:55:34] <RiceeFTW> @valriot that's actually the exact OPPOSITE of what you're supposed to do, you're supposed to keep swinging until they deflect you
[0:55:47] <Romuken> I dont have the game, but i see the thing.
[0:55:54] <Shishi1205> custom combo
[0:55:55] <Blackjackal95> @valriot there are bosses and enemies later on where purely deflecting won't do shit
[0:55:56] <captainnathaniel> do you have the umbrella yet?
[0:56:01] <aizt> you always have jump counter
[0:56:02] <valriot> @riceeftw Yeah, except you have one combo string
[0:56:07] <$megamonmon123> you got this woolie
[0:56:13] <big_chugnus> @WoolieVersus Just hit him but then don't get hit
[0:56:17] <RiceeFTW> @valriot except you don't, because you have 3 different shinobi tools as well as combat arts...?
[0:56:17] <gigacanuck> deflect you fool
[0:56:19] <xeros720> do woolie combo
[0:56:23] <PsychicKirby> @captainnathaniel I do not think he does
[0:56:27] <$megamonmon123> i can see git gud in progress
[0:56:31] <0dokuro> This game sets you up so you are good at both dodging and deflecting. Relying on one or the other will make you suffer.
[0:56:32] <aizt> the guy who teaches it only shows you that it exists
[0:56:35] <scrumbotime> i just went in on this guy, after him being why i put down the game, and the fight took me 30 seconds once i realized "just deflect him"
[0:56:36] <+Weeewer> having one combo string is a bit of a bummer with Sekiro
[0:56:41] <$Retrash> this is one of the fights where doding is better than deflecting
[0:56:43] <juxtest> Gotta wait for him to do Hellport and punish
[0:56:46] <$Retrash> dodging*
[0:57:03] <Blackjackal95> @retrash not really
[0:57:06] <%MetroidPrimeRib> not at all you can kill him in seconds if you actually deflect him perfectly
[0:57:08] <FackinCrazy> @Retrash your crazy
[0:57:10] <DianaTheAscian> is this gonna be worse than snake eyes?
[0:57:11] <%MetroidPrimeRib> which is hard
[0:57:12] <+Sabre_Basilisk> @aizt Never twigged on that, thought i had to wait for him to show me
[0:57:13] <+dheng1> You gonna learn today
[0:57:13] <+thesw1tch> @woolieversus have you tried shooting him with a gun?
[0:57:16] <valriot> Shinobi tools are incredibly specific and gimmicky, and the Ichimonchi (whatever its called) is it. its still less of a moveset than DS1 Uchi
[0:57:20] <$Retrash> you can cheese him by spamming dodge left + attack
[0:57:24] <%guyalex> learn the deflect, it pays off in the long run
[0:57:29] <%VJdarkworld> @valriot theres about 3 different counter types so it aint “just block” o_0
[0:57:30] <0dokuro> This fight can be beat in less then a minute by understanding the timing.
[0:57:32] <%guyalex> plus it feels fuckin great
[0:57:32] <NaturalGear> @Retrash I agree but even deflecting is pretty simple once you notice the tell
[0:57:32] <worldbrand> brisk, spring takes on a cool day in may
[0:57:34] <+Deuce_Willington> He's incorporated the Parry into his strategy. he's learning!
[0:57:37] <D3rrtyD4n> just watch for the flash
[0:57:39] <Jontman42> All you gotta do is deflect him and nothing else until he uses up all his posture.
[0:57:49] <0dokuro> Its the reason its here, since youre fight (you know who) next.
[0:57:52] <DianaTheAscian> NICE
[0:57:52] <Tucker0603> I feel like playing an assassin in For Honor would give good practice for this, I don't main an assassin but I'm seeing the patterns with him
[0:57:53] <FackinCrazy> @Retrash you can cheese him by deflecting like 2 attack stings
[0:57:53] <+robobeau> C L E A N
[0:57:57] <aizt> @Sabre_Basilisk i had to learn it the hard way because i ended his story line before he taught it to me, i just never talked to him until i got the thing
[0:58:05] <TrashLeviathan> this guy is just orochi from for honor
[0:58:10] <+korth367> you can cheese him by beating him
[0:58:13] <ISkyHunterI> This fight because so piss easy when you realize that dodging forward and left negates all his attacks
[0:58:21] <valriot> @vjdarkworld Hence why i said deflect is dull. the 3 parry system is great, wouldve been better with a standard combat system not focusing on trading deflects constantly
[0:58:22] <RoboXGP> Sekiro looks like someone from onimusha
[0:58:39] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 except he's actually using heavy attacks Kappa
[0:58:41] <RiceeFTW> @valriot they're not gimmicky at all, and they're not specific, that just means you're using them poorly. the shinobi tool upgrades give you tons of options
[0:58:45] <0dokuro> Believe in the Woolie Blade.
[0:58:50] <D3rrtyD4n> flash, deflect deflect
[0:58:59] <PsychicKirby> I have to say though, after beating the game and just chilling and watching someone play. The musical score to this game was fantastically crafted.
[0:59:08] <Parapattern> Jinsuke Saze studied the blade
[0:59:09] <Man_in_the_Red> did woolie die to jinsuke by some miracle
[0:59:10] <valriot> @riceeftw They really dont though, the most useful one is the the spear drag on the Ape
[0:59:11] <snow_bush> So, what combat arts you guys use?
[0:59:16] <aizt> and after doing a second run of the game, the only other thing you really need to unlock for dealing with enemies is mikiri counter, everything else is superfluous
[0:59:20] <Man_in_the_Red> LUL
[0:59:24] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 i wish ubi would make orochis heavys better
[0:59:24] <RiceeFTW> @valriot uh, firecrackers are OP against just about every enemy in the game
[0:59:25] <Blank9> deflect is a way better system for combat than souls games
[0:59:33] <ISkyHunterI> you can never go wrong with whirlend slash
[0:59:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:59:34] <+BelieverBill> Defect, deflect, deflect
[0:59:37] <FitzZappa> Parry for the love of god woolie
[0:59:37] <+Weeewer> consider: sprinting
[0:59:39] <chiazam> You can stealth kill him
[0:59:39] <RiceeFTW> @valriot shurikens are probably the most combat effective and most efficient in the game
[0:59:41] <Nova893> He's not letting you attack him after his swings
[0:59:41] <DianaTheAscian> side steps were working well
[0:59:42] <%jinking79> this is a phase one Vergil fight
[0:59:42] <Jontman42> He's overthinking a situation where literally all you gotta do is deflect
[0:59:43] <captainnathaniel> parry
[0:59:43] <%Solidnick18> don't overthink it
[0:59:45] <0dokuro> Firecrackers and Umbrella are considered the strongest.
[0:59:49] <VioletHeart> Deflect and posture is an *amazing* system.
[0:59:53] <KumaTorey> he won't learn. never will learn. he is stuck in his ways LUL
[0:59:54] <+DirtyMidnighter> MIST RAVEN
[0:59:54] <Nova893> So focus on parrying. it fills up so much
[0:59:59] <Truebluemc> i believe 2 or 3 rounds of perfect deflects will get him
[1:00:00] <VioletHeart> Umbrella's situational but really amazing.
[1:00:02] <+Weeewer> @Solidnick18 its Woolie tho its part of the charm
[1:00:02] <0dokuro> Mist Raven is super good too though
[1:00:03] <+BelieverBill> Time the attack
[1:00:06] <+Deuce_Willington> @VioletHeart Agreed big time
[1:00:10] <NaturalGear> the Ashina Spearman that woolie first tried gave me MUCH more troubles than this dude
[1:00:17] <valriot> @riceeftw Yeah...its still not interesting, its just open up an enemy to do your one combo again. shurikens fix FromSofts "Dog hitbox" issue though
[1:00:18] <aizt> he actively tries to not learn, lets add this to the lore
[1:00:21] <Shishi1205> can we post links here? just asking
[1:00:21] <PsychicKirby> @valriot I used the "special" one after getting the "special" item. The flurry combat art and the one Woolie is currently using.
[1:00:21] <sarg1010> Already half posture with one combo deflect LUL
[1:00:30] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 yeah, although first I want them to give my LB the rest of his rework, feels like they only gave him half of it.
[1:00:31] <%Solidnick18> @Weeewer i know lol it's good
[1:00:45] <FackinCrazy> Anybody else get a wisper for some shitty coupon glitch phishing attempt
[1:00:48] <0dokuro> Punish
[1:00:58] <+Sabre_Basilisk> go in
[1:00:58] <RiceeFTW> @valriot it's not "open up an enemy" at all, it's about breaking posture, which means relentless offense and clashing swords rather than waiting for an opening like the other Soulsborne games
[1:00:58] <%VJdarkworld> @valriot i still disagree since how deflects work with posture its way more engaging than souls game roll spam
[1:01:12] <aizt> also i should say i really never got good until the very end of the game
[1:01:15] <RoboXGP> I never liked parrying with a sheild, I'd rather two hand so this game is perfect for me.
[1:01:17] <+TamaskaLem> Of course his name is Jin
[1:01:17] <aizt> like i never blocked shit
[1:01:18] <VioletHeart> Deflections also *look* amazing.
[1:01:21] <RiceeFTW> @valriot it's about taking turns, like a real sword fight
[1:01:26] <valriot> @psychickirby I mean the issue is most of them leave you wide open and have no value damage wise. the posture regain is infinitely more useful
[1:01:28] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 at least lb is slightly better than he use to be
[1:01:34] <VioletHeart> The game could do with some more complexity in combos but the actual core systems are amazing.
[1:01:36] <Shishi1205> Easy 2 minute guide to kill this guy /watch?v=j1OvIxZsdxo
[1:01:44] <gigacanuck> maybe Woolie needs a few more passives before he can beat this guy
[1:01:45] <Man_in_the_Red> so does woolie remember the consecutive deflect bonus
[1:01:47] <+anime_boyz> you can use firecrackers as a defense to prevent getting punished when chugging estus
[1:01:50] <Quantumsheep1> Ichimonji is a baaaaad call here
[1:02:01] <0dokuro> I'd like more prosthetics honestly...
[1:02:01] <+Weeewer> Try using Flame Vent
[1:02:02] <valriot> @riceeftw Yeah, relentless offence, using your one combo though
[1:02:03] <Man_in_the_Red> because that one fact makes this guy a chump
[1:02:09] <+Weeewer> Its the tool I used for every boss that wasnt fire resistant
[1:02:13] <+BelieverBill> They are not reading the chat
[1:02:17] <@Solidus_113> you can always buy more
[1:02:17] <+Weeewer> Fire Damage over time really helps
[1:02:19] <Blank9> Souls games had basically 1 combo
[1:02:21] <VioletHeart> Oh wow, you are low on emblems.
[1:02:22] <+Weeewer> Ah well
[1:02:25] <Blank9> especially bloodborne
[1:02:27] <NaturalGear> I thinks stamina system and posture system are both good, they just have different focuses
[1:02:28] <aizt> they are ignoring the chat SO hard
[1:02:29] <Truebluemc> i feel like holding block before he attacks is throwing woolie off
[1:02:30] <%Explodincatz> Explodincatz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[1:02:35] <tattleworm> woolie has been excommunicated from the royal guard
[1:02:37] <RiceeFTW> @valriot uh there's also thrusts, combat arts, and shinobi tools you can switch on the fly though, so...
[1:02:41] <0dokuro> Careful, this cant eventually get you
[1:02:41] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 oh yes, he certainly is, but he does have some glaring problems and his heavy finishers needs some kind of soft-feint
[1:02:43] <+BelieverBill> Flash, deflect, deflect
[1:02:44] <Slimeking_Mike> @aizt good
[1:02:44] <0dokuro> can*
[1:02:49] <Quantumsheep1> He can absolutely beat him rn, he just needs to get the parry timing down
[1:02:51] <aizt> last stream woolie was looking for a gourd seed when he had one in his inventory the whole time
[1:02:52] <VioletHeart> Friendship ended with Royal Guard. Now Trickster is my new best friend.
[1:02:57] <+Weeewer> LUL
[1:03:03] <+Weeewer> Ive run out of emblems
[1:03:03] <PsychicKirby> @valriot The way the game works is the more health dmg you deal the more the posture dmg "sticks" Combat Arts are for openings to weaken the enemy or get you out of situations. They help chunk the enemy down so it's easier to posture break them.
[1:03:06] <+Weeewer> I used them all the time
[1:03:06] <+NiktenKing> LUL
[1:03:09] <+Deuce_Willington> Woolie's holding block until the enemy is about to attack, then dropping it so he can dodge better
[1:03:10] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 he needs soft feint into his bash or long arm
[1:03:13] <juxtest> I forgot you could buy emblems
[1:03:18] <%VJdarkworld> I used fire to take off some of his HP so he posture wouldnt go down so fast
[1:03:20] <+Weeewer> They were the only ways to really spice up combat so I tried to use them a lot
[1:03:20] <%KaizenChaos> just buy more you might die
[1:03:23] <+DirtyMidnighter> I super ran out
[1:03:34] <Calek> think I had like 300 by the end of the game
[1:03:37] <Calek> I just never used them
[1:03:38] <valriot> @vjdarkworld Yeah but posture is trivialised by just knowing when to hit L1. Its not like Nioh where youre actively using various moves to drain stamina, within a standard well thought out combat system
[1:03:41] <+DirtyMidnighter> Especially on next boss
[1:03:50] <Man_in_the_Red> did someone tell Woolz the I frames a re horrible on the dash yet
[1:03:59] <DianaTheAscian> did stream go jank for anyone else?
[1:04:06] <@Solidus_113> when you die you lose half your stuff anyways, why not spend it all and not lose anything on death
[1:04:06] <TrashLeviathan> @Nina96 no
[1:04:07] <primaryfire> i had 386 when i beat the game. used moderately
[1:04:07] <PsychicKirby> @valriot Minus the Samurai stance that he's currently using that actually pressures posture heavily.
[1:04:09] <+DirtyMidnighter> “But what if I need them later”
[1:04:14] <0dokuro> Become the Ninja Samurai you were born to be Wool
[1:04:20] <DianaTheAscian> welp time to refresh
[1:04:40] <BabyNaBackbrace> What if they add PvP later?
[1:04:41] <+Estuko> this samurai is so damn cool
[1:04:43] <0dokuro> oooo
[1:04:47] <+BelieverBill> Parry.
[1:04:48] <0dokuro> You had it
[1:04:49] <valriot> @psychickirby I already said that art was the best one though, cos it is
[1:04:55] <+Deuce_Willington> Enemy attacks are opportunities to do Poise damage
[1:04:57] <Man_in_the_Red> @Estuko he's so easy though
[1:05:00] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 indeed, he also needs a bit more stamina, he's got a lot of mix-ups now but not enough juice to use em. also can the please not make the stamina usage on impaling charge absolutely shit. look at my girl raider's charge ffs!
[1:05:00] <+Estuko> @BabyNaBackbrace don't think there's any online in this game? it'd be kinda weird
[1:05:02] <Unimpressions> just deflect.
[1:05:03] <gigacanuck> @BabyNaBackbrace what if your wife orbits my dick?
[1:05:03] <+TONYOO101> man woolie's gonna have a fun time at centipede
[1:05:06] <Man_in_the_Red> like, Pinwheel easy
[1:05:08] <+Deuce_Willington> YAY!
[1:05:13] <NaturalGear> @valriot "trivialised by just knowing when to hit L1" I think that's the point of the game
[1:05:18] <+Risingxiv> literally just deflect to win
[1:05:19] <0dokuro> @TONYOO101 O'Rin though...
[1:05:22] <+Estuko> @haveswordmuststing you can be an easy enemy but still have a cool design FeelsBadMan
[1:05:26] <PsychicKirby> @valriot That's fine. Other stances have their uses.
[1:05:28] <RiceeFTW> unseen aid PogChamp
[1:05:30] <+MagicBeanBurrito> This is just royal guard: the game
[1:05:30] <valriot> @rupansen And im saying thats bad
[1:05:34] <Jontman42> So is the format of streaming now that Woolie doesn't look at chat at all?
[1:05:38] <sarg1010> Pog look at thaaaat
[1:05:45] <NinjaTB> oooooh its this guy
[1:05:46] <NaturalGear> @valriot Your opinion man
[1:05:48] <+BelieverBill> Parry with guard up = 15 fames, Parry alone = 30 frames
[1:05:48] <BabyNaBackbrace> @Estuko maybe just a main menu option, you load up your Sekiro to fight someone else's Sekiro
[1:05:49] <+Sabre_Basilisk> woolie your way is wrong
[1:05:49] <Shishi1205> as soon as you see the flash on his sword double tap the block button @WoolieVersus
[1:05:50] <gigacanuck> come on Woolie I thought you were a Royal Guard main
[1:05:51] <valriot> @magickburritoh Thats a huge insult to Royal Guard
[1:05:52] <worldbrand> why does he go in with a block?
[1:05:56] <VioletHeart> Yeyeye
[1:06:01] <Novillion> Well chat's been backseating SUPER hard so its understandable
[1:06:04] <Man_in_the_Red> @Estuko true, the rematch convinced me to get the Ashina cross secret art first
[1:06:06] <RiceeFTW> @worldbrand blocking lowers posture faster
[1:06:07] <+HajimenoStream> minh why u sleeping in movie theaters
[1:06:08] <%Solidnick18> um
[1:06:10] <DianaTheAscian> @BabyNaBackbrace i honesty dont know how that would work sekiros move set isnt varied enough to make things interesting
[1:06:12] <worldbrand> he has no posture damage
[1:06:13] <0dokuro> You keep getting it
[1:06:21] <+Deuce_Willington> Your way looked good tho! This guy is just here to quiz you on you deflects
[1:06:26] <%VJdarkworld> @valriot i think ur confused on how sekiro works o_0. Posture != stamina . Your supposed to keep deflecting to get posture kills
[1:06:31] <+Sabre_Basilisk> flash backs to the dark souls 2 lp
[1:06:34] <RiceeFTW> @worldbrand I agree lol, just wanted to make it aware tho

[1:06:38] <%BigChiefBear> Take your time my dude, dont care if you beat it fast im here to watch you play
[1:06:40] <DXLelouch24> cmon Woolie Dante would be embarassed
[1:06:51] <BabyNaBackbrace> @Nina96 the variety of the tools would be the biggest difference, but yeah it would still be a liitle shallow
[1:06:53] <%doughvatkyn> doughvatkyn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Vergil is following you everywhere.
[1:06:54] <+DirtyMidnighter> So excited for next boss
[1:06:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Gonna have to learn to Royal Guard Woolie
[1:06:58] <sarg1010> Much better that time
[1:07:00] <DianaTheAscian> @DXLelouch24 but vergil would be proud
[1:07:02] <Man_in_the_Red> [Royal Guard membership AT RISK!]
[1:07:04] <0dokuro> Much better
[1:07:04] <simulationbard> I believe in you wools
[1:07:04] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:07:04] <Shishi1205> as soon as you see the flash on his sword double tap the block button @WoolieVersus think about it
[1:07:04] <KumaTorey> shuriken trick shuriken trick shuriken trick
[1:07:08] <+SvenHolgersson> Easy mode now selectable
[1:07:14] <Ashenik1> Where does woolie rank sekiro in souls list??
[1:07:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> > Woolie not knowing how to Royal Guard Kappa
[1:07:18] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus there's a sprint button too
[1:07:22] <valriot> @vjdarkworld I beat it last month, so this isnt a "i dont get it", i beat the terrible Demon boss as well
[1:07:24] <worldbrand> my gist is, doesn't going in blocking make parrying more difficult because you have to release and then re-block on reflex?
[1:07:27] <%Solidnick18> i thought this was easy mode?
[1:07:32] <Shishi1205> the unseen aid luck lmao
[1:07:32] <apostateCourier> don't create distance, always go in
[1:07:35] <Unimpressions> some people find parry from block easier
[1:07:39] <Unimpressions> parrying*
[1:07:40] <Blackjackal95> hesitation is defeat
[1:07:43] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 I love my girl Raider so much...but her stunning tap is a little much now
[1:07:44] <Man_in_the_Red> @Ashenik1 he supposedly LOVES royal guard so it must be the best in his eyes Kappa
[1:07:50] <Jontman42> Don't even double tap, just mash the button
[1:07:56] <gigacanuck> LUL
[1:08:03] <0dokuro> jump when that happens
[1:08:03] <RoboXGP> woolie backing out lol
[1:08:08] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus it's a rhythm game LUL
[1:08:09] <gigacanuck> I think he's starting to tilt
[1:08:09] <RoboXGP> gotta trade
[1:08:12] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 i think the overall damage buff is a little much
[1:08:13] <+Deuce_Willington> Switching from Trickster! to Royal Gaurd!
[1:08:15] <apostateCourier> the backdown is real
[1:08:17] <PsychicKirby> He may find out that you can perry tap from blocking.
[1:08:17] <%VJdarkworld> @valriot i think the system just aint clicking with ya, which is fine.
[1:08:23] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 400ms stun with 18damage and it's a soft feint...is crazy
[1:08:26] <+BelieverBill> Just parry....
[1:08:31] <%doughvatkyn> The problem is that moving around him ruins your parry timing.
[1:08:31] <+SvenHolgersson> its like 90% parries Woolie
[1:08:35] <%doughvatkyn> Less footsies.
[1:08:39] <+NiktenKing> It's like 80-20
[1:08:40] <apostateCourier> go in, parry when you see the swing
[1:08:46] <DianaTheAscian> NICE#

[1:08:52] <Shishi1205> The enemies give you visual clues to land the deflects, as soon as you see the flash on his sword double tap the block button @WoolieVersus think about it
[1:08:53] <Quantumsheep1> Just parrying is easily the best way to fight him, you just stand there and do it 4-5 times and he's done

[1:09:17] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 at least i can parry it, because a lot of raiders are predictable
[1:09:17] <Man_in_the_Red> you know what may have made this game really easy for me, setting it to Nero controls because "Sekiro isnt a souls"
[1:09:18] <+dheng1> I knew you had it in you
[1:09:23] <valriot> @vjdarkworld Except i beat it???? I beat this guy in 2 tries, difficult isnt the issue. the games just dull, and is just about pressing one button at the right time
[1:09:23] <0dokuro> Now for more Parry!
[1:09:23] <Graxe_> Good job, Woolz
[1:09:26] <+grim_alex95> WELL LOOK AT THAT

[1:09:54] <%Solidnick18> yes lol but it's understandable
[1:09:54] <apostateCourier> he parried 4 times and won
[1:09:56] <VioletHeart> Don't feel bad, Wools. Everyone had trouble first time on this guy.
[1:09:56] <PsychicKirby> Same Mihn
[1:10:01] <juxtest> Now its time to learn the do or die lightning reversal
[1:10:02] <%Razputin217> Woolie Figured It Out
[1:10:05] <Parapattern> It's only hard if you try to fight him like an actual enemy
[1:10:06] <FackinCrazy> At least that scraped some of the rust off
[1:10:06] <Unimpressions> next boss is like, the highlight of the game
[1:10:06] <RoboXGP> half the souls bases uses a sword tho so there's no point saying Sekiro is dull...

[1:10:22] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 yeah, though currently I'm at college...and forced to use their WiFi...parries become 50/50 of not even working
[1:10:23] <+SvenHolgersson> Weird huh
[1:10:25] <VioletHeart> the
[1:10:25] <DianaTheAscian> aw yeah i love this thing
[1:10:26] <+NiktenKing> LUL
[1:10:27] <VioletHeart> lightning
[1:10:31] <SixthSun2> We Avatar now
[1:10:31] <simulationbard> This is super cool
[1:10:34] <0dokuro> Its not grounded yet so that both doesn't and does make sense.
[1:10:34] <Shishi1205> quite important
[1:10:35] <DXLelouch24> parry lightning
[1:10:35] <%QueequegTheater> I wonder why they would tell us this now HMMMMMM
[1:10:36] <mumu2734> 굿
[1:10:36] <Bob8644> RIDO ZA LIGHTONINGU
[1:10:36] <PsychicKirby> ZUBAZ COUNTER
[1:10:37] <valriot> @roboxgp Except even a longsword has 3x the moveset of this games katana
[1:10:37] <Nyckelus> He’s there to drill into your noggin that “parrying is recommended.”
[1:10:38] <+Deuce_Willington> Probably not important.
[1:10:39] <Graxe_> It's super cool
[1:10:40] <+SvenHolgersson> definitly no foreshadowing here
[1:10:40] <0dokuro> "Sure"
[1:10:40] <%Solidnick18> you'll see
[1:10:42] <DianaTheAscian> KINDA
[1:10:45] <%VJdarkworld> @valriot im not talking about difficulty o_0 im talking about the flow of the game. Its fine if it doesnt click with ya.
[1:10:46] <Shishi1205> Yeah
[1:10:47] <BabyNaBackbrace> I never pulled the Reversal off, because I managed to crazy dodge the attacks
[1:10:47] <Yung_FckUp> dont explain
[1:10:47] <Tucker0603> IT'S FUCKING RAD
[1:10:47] <Nyckelus> This move is sick!
[1:10:51] <+robobeau> For the life of me I never hit this ONCE in the last boss fight
[1:10:51] <NaturalGear> "Reverse the Lightning" sounds like a MGRR song
[1:10:51] <Man_in_the_Red> its a stun if someone hits you with a down B
[1:10:54] <ScudmanSentinel> you DON'T NEED to L1. you just need to get hit and do the R1 launch
[1:10:55] <mumu2734> 고
[1:11:01] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 i play on console so i feel you
[1:11:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> Catch lightning in air, throw it back
[1:11:05] <Ashenik1> Guys I have to confess AC Odessy' legendary boar is harder than any boss in souls series. CMV Kappa
[1:11:06] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Ride the lightning
[1:11:11] <0dokuro> You gotta use your inner Gywn
[1:11:12] <%doughvatkyn> Yeah, the L1 bit is a little bit of a lie.
[1:11:16] <DianaTheAscian> Like last air bender
[1:11:17] <+Zayasu> theres no need to L1 right
[1:11:17] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 Midir exists
[1:11:19] <%doughvatkyn> Just get hit in the air and R1 before landing.
[1:11:22] <Yung_FckUp> wonder when an enemy like that will show up
[1:11:24] <FackinCrazy> Just like Aang
[1:11:26] <mumu2734> 고
[1:11:28] <Graxe_> Reverse the Sunlight Spear back at Gwyn
[1:11:31] <RoboXGP> he's not going to use a shield tho so one handing is pointless, one handed with a sword vs a spear, spear wins
[1:11:32] <Man_in_the_Red> its weaker than a rooster peck
[1:11:32] <KumaTorey> best comparison with sekiro is its like a chinese finger trap. an easy solution but ppl just go at it and Make it worse than it really is
[1:11:33] <+Weeewer> its not damage until you land I think
[1:11:36] <worldbrand> Yeah it's not a lot of damage until you land
[1:11:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Just jump and spam yeah
[1:11:45] <ScudmanSentinel> best part is that it gives some momentum in the jump too
[1:11:47] <0dokuro> If you believe in the Dark Soul hard enough, you cant deflect lightning.
[1:11:48] <+Sabre_Basilisk> The second best No u
[1:12:15] <RiceeFTW> YOU WA SHOCK
[1:12:15] <%QueequegTheater> I WONDER WHY THEY'RE GIVING IT TO YOU noW
[1:12:19] <RoboXGP> gotta lead the casual noobs who play dark souls lol
[1:12:21] <Tucker0603> you take all the Lightning damage if you fail the counter @woolieversus
[1:12:23] <DianaTheAscian> it like in monhun
[1:12:23] <0dokuro> I WONDER WHY
[1:12:28] <%Psyramics> does this item seem pointless to anyone else? Anytime I got hit by lightning I was immediately Shocked
[1:12:33] <worldbrand> anyone in here ever use that item even once?
[1:12:34] <%Razputin217> sbfpBaz sbfpBaz sbfpBaz
[1:12:39] <0dokuro> I did
[1:12:43] <PsychicKirby> Go figure, they gave you jumping and it's important.
[1:12:44] <Shishi1205> you take it premptively i suppose
[1:12:46] <RiceeFTW> @Psyramics yeahh, out of all the items in the game, this was probably the least useful
[1:12:48] <RoboXGP> no eel liver is mostly pointless
[1:12:48] <Unimpressions> are you supposed to use it before the right?
[1:12:49] <cosmictrashcan> @KumaTorey true, i remember i refused to parry most attacks because i thought it would be too hard. Turns out it actually made the game 3 times easier when i started parrying
[1:12:49] <Jontman42> It's kinda weird how you get this before encountering a single enemy that uses lightning
[1:12:51] <0dokuro> Vs a later boss though...
[1:12:52] <DianaTheAscian> i never used it
[1:12:53] <worldbrand> color me surprised
[1:12:53] <FackinCrazy> What county had the moats filled with electric eels
[1:12:54] <%VJdarkworld> Praise The Sun \[T]/
[1:12:55] <%Solidnick18> just window
[1:13:00] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 talk to you soon man, gotta longboard back to my apartment
[1:13:02] <Man_in_the_Red> @Psyramics you reverse the lightning by avoiuding ground
[1:13:02] <%QueequegTheater> He's so graceful
[1:13:08] <@Solidus_113> yeyeye
[1:13:08] <CraZ80> @Psyramics it reduces the damage I think
[1:13:14] <Ashenik1> @QueequegTheater Does Midir summons little boars mid fight ?? Exectly
[1:13:14] <大叔打電動> U only need to jump , L1 is not necessarily. Thanthat notice sucks lol
[1:13:15] <SixthSun2> monkaS
[1:13:15] <0dokuro> Kite Man doing the lords work
[1:13:16] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 aight

[1:13:25] <+loukemia83> member that whistle though?

[1:13:26] <Tucker0603> wait but first....

[1:13:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HERE WE GO
[1:13:29] <%Psyramics> @haveswordmuststing Yeah, I know that. But if you screw up, you just get Shocked immediately. there's no Shock buildup

[1:15:00] <worldbrand> i wish i had his confidence
[1:15:05] <+buttdirt> do you think your Wu-tang sword can defeat me?!
[1:15:06] <Man_in_the_Red> Vergil 2's gonna be a bitch this time around
[1:15:09] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus the dragon's blood must be freely given
[1:15:10] <cosmictrashcan> It will only take 30 times don't worry kuro
[1:15:11] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus This is literally the same fight
[1:15:11] <gigacanuck> oh, right, and Frieza said Namek would blow up in 5 minutes
[1:15:11] <0dokuro> Time for Bow
[1:15:12] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its this the first time woolz is fighting my boy geninchiro ?
[1:15:12] <+MagicBeanBurrito> But he can't die
[1:15:15] <+Sabre_Basilisk> IT'S TIME TO D-D-DDDD- DUEL
[1:15:15] <Aydarkzero> it's time chat!
[1:15:15] <RiceeFTW> "my shinobi has a cool as name, ur just a nerd"
[1:15:17] <thebehatted> "as long as you're still alive" lol about that
[1:15:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NOW WIN
[1:15:22] <+MagicBeanBurrito> so as long as you're alive means nothing
[1:15:30] <Mendin> Welcome to Dark Souls PVP on crack
[1:15:32] <+NiktenKing> He's doing it
[1:15:33] <Bob8644> i love how you can hear his voice raise once and instantly identify the voice actor
[1:15:35] <+dheng1> Round 1 fight !
[1:15:37] <Shishi1205> Watching speed runs has ruined geni for me
[1:15:39] <+EySoyCoco> damn woolie got gud
[1:15:44] <Lagseene> oh shit, here we go again
[1:16:01] <+dheng1> We bout to see ultra instinct woolz
[1:16:01] <+Deuce_Willington> For the folks at home, the lesson this fight should teach you is "Be aggressive and don't let up"
[1:16:07] <apostateCourier> ^
[1:16:13] <%doughvatkyn> no don't bully geni
[1:16:13] <%Solidnick18> Genichiro is such fun fight
[1:16:16] <Unimpressions> enemy can't attack if too busy blocking
[1:16:17] <Man_in_the_Red> i still wonder why he takes less tries than Granny
[1:16:18] <apostateCourier> that's the whole game
[1:16:22] <%doughvatkyn> let him finish his combos
[1:16:25] <apostateCourier> Always Go In
[1:16:26] <RiceeFTW> he got OTGs? lmaoo
[1:16:27] <+Deuce_Willington> This will be much easier for Wools than the last one lol
[1:16:28] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 shit now I don't wanna leave, what if woolie beats him on my way back?
[1:16:29] <%jinking79> become Akuma
[1:16:30] <Mendin> This is a solid first attempt so far
[1:16:37] <$Big_Dream> this game is all about not hesitating being aggressive as fuck
[1:16:41] <Slimeking_Mike> genichiro's so cool... but also such a dumbass motherfucker....
[1:16:43] <Suneater_Jerome> Sekiro looks so cool
[1:16:43] <%linearlinera> he's doing quite well
[1:16:45] <+whoguru5> hey woolie and chat how is sekiro going?
[1:16:49] <TrashLeviathan> @Tucker0603 understandable
[1:16:53] <energywarning> helmsplut
[1:16:54] <DukeBlack_> jaboodyTroll he's panicking
[1:16:54] <%QueequegTheater> "camera"
[1:16:56] <PsychicKirby> He's learning
[1:16:59] <Suneater_Jerome> i live for battles like these
[1:17:00] <juxtest> Damn he might actually do it
[1:17:00] <apostateCourier> it's ok you got this
[1:17:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Panicking
[1:17:06] <+Epic_Skeptic> second favorite fight
[1:17:07] <+robobeau> Yo that was a legit good first attemp
[1:17:08] <Shishi1205> Camera tm the bane of souls
[1:17:13] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:17:14] <Jontman42> Why not just make camera good
[1:17:15] <+Ultimate_Edge> Nah. It's their punishment for being cornered
[1:17:16] <+Sabre_Basilisk> f
[1:17:17] <%Solidnick18> oh not nice
[1:17:17] <RiceeFTW> noooo you haddd ittt
[1:17:18] <worldbrand> so clooose
[1:17:19] <Man_in_the_Red> OTGs
[1:17:19] <+linSP> aww
[1:17:20] <+Zayasu> oki LUL
[1:17:22] <%ScrubinBubblez> woolie the god
[1:17:22] <%QueequegTheater> He's getting way too greedy
[1:17:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Was that the camera too? Kappa
[1:17:26] <+Ultimate_Edge> Dam great try tho
[1:17:26] <Nova893> what's the camera supposed to do when you back into a wall? idk
[1:17:26] <+StrangeCoincidence> JON I CAN SMELL YOU
[1:17:27] <Mendin> Solid, SOLID first try
[1:17:27] <thebehatted> I mean that was a pretty good first attempt
[1:17:28] <RoboXGP> that sound when sekiro dies is so generic lol
[1:17:32] <mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> MINH
[1:17:32] <gigacanuck> "as many times as it takes" LUL I hope you didn't have anything else to do today
[1:17:34] <%jinking79> helm split
[1:17:34] <apostateCourier> aw, great first attempt
[1:17:35] <%Solidnick18> Good first try
[1:17:37] <+dheng1> Eye of the tiger woolz
[1:17:41] <+dheng1> Good first try
[1:17:41] <DianaTheAscian> it is strange how the camera always freaks out in cornners
[1:17:42] <ReaversEdge45> I favored the axe during my fight with Genichiro
[1:17:42] <Tucker0603> @leviathan666303 fuck it gonna risk it, better not beat him
[1:17:44] <Man_in_the_Red> make a pact with me, NOW
[1:17:45] <%doughvatkyn> you could have the camera see through a wall instead but walls are supposed to punish you
[1:17:46] <NaturalGear> TBH it kinda replicates the feeling of being cornered, you just have to avoid it
[1:17:48] <ClutchSuts> Solid attempt
[1:17:51] <Quantumsheep1> Focusing too much on damage over parries
[1:17:53] <%VJdarkworld> The Real Demon’s Souls Starts Here
[1:17:54] <大叔打電動> Hidetaka 's game camera sucks always lol
[1:17:54] <Jontman42> The thing is he kinda can't force him
[1:17:55] <Yung_FckUp> thats just being japanese
[1:17:56] <DXLelouch24> you cant force it
[1:17:56] <SixthSun2> I mean, he can't force him, it's impossible
[1:18:10] <+EySoyCoco> he has to give it i guess
[1:18:14] <apostateCourier> he doesn't know how to get the immortality out of Kuro
[1:18:17] <DianaTheAscian> u did better than pat on his first
[1:18:21] <BabyNaBackbrace> The camera simulates bad positioning in a real fight, since you can't see 270 degrees behind yourself IRL
[1:18:22] <juxtest> Kuro being invincible helps
[1:18:22] <RiceeFTW> LUL triggers from there
[1:18:23] <%doughvatkyn> It's most likely intentional game design to give that element of narrowness in an area.
[1:18:26] <PsychicKirby> Get that Eye of the Tiger on repeat boys. He's gonna have to ride the lightning. tomatoCool
[1:18:28] <+Deuce_Willington> The Japanese language has no words for asking for things rudely
[1:18:38] <%QueequegTheater> Reminder that Japan considers anything other than absolute respect at all times for everyone to be vulgar
[1:18:47] <ReaversEdge45> "Kuro ples, stopping having dragon blood all to yourself "
[1:18:52] <+dheng1> He’s the first big test on what you learned so far
[1:19:01] <%QueequegTheater> So Genichiro is not behaving oddly
[1:19:05] <apostateCourier> Kuro doesn't know how to bleed
[1:19:05] <VioletHeart> The finisher for that combo is so rad.
[1:19:05] <gigacanuck> "Kuro please give dragon blood"
[1:19:09] <apostateCourier> he is incapable
[1:19:25] <Bob8644> this is like if roxas was the first fight in KH2
[1:19:30] <gigacanuck> "Kuro I showed you my castle give me your dragon blood"
[1:19:31] <RiceeFTW> yup, keep attacking like Lady Butterfly, learn how to parry like the Ashina Elite, and recognize the type of attacks from all the past battles
[1:19:33] <Bob8644> not just the final mix version.
[1:19:40] <BabyNaBackbrace> Genichiro guest in Soul Calibur when?
[1:19:40] <PsychicKirby> I remember being on Genchiro for a while, but I came out better at the game.
[1:19:50] <Ashenik1> @QueequegTheater Is Korea or China similar in this aspect to Japan?
[1:19:50] <%doughvatkyn> I think the bow is the most punishing part of this fight. The parries can kinda be spammed.
[1:20:02] <Bob8644> i get those sweeps every tiiiiiime
[1:20:04] <DianaTheAscian> always jump after he plunges down
[1:20:06] <+HellCopter> That wasn't a sweep
[1:20:09] <Shishi1205> damn
[1:20:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ichimonji ftw
[1:20:12] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 Most of East Asia is, but IIRC Japan is the most extreme about it
[1:20:12] <Man_in_the_Red> @doughvatkyn but that can happen
[1:20:12] <RiceeFTW> is that MAX PUNISH? lmao
[1:20:13] <RoboXGP> sweeps are just low swings, thrust are more angular and from the body
[1:20:14] <scrumbotime> please someone clip when The Thing happens in this fight
[1:20:19] <+dheng1> He pulls back when he sweeps
[1:20:19] <GoldeNOVA> What form of power is this? Kappa
[1:20:21] <Quantumsheep1> Wonder how long it's going to take for him to adjust to the unblockable out of helmsplitter
[1:20:21] <DukeBlack_> get in that ass
[1:20:21] <Pillagius> perfect timing to join - 666 viewers
[1:20:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YEYEYEYE
[1:20:24] <PsychicKirby> "Raise your hand if sweeps got you guys too" -hand up-
[1:20:25] <+sir_louis> ICHI
[1:20:26] <Mendin> ONE
[1:20:27] <superking247> nice
[1:20:30] <Pillagius> So... This is playthrough # what?
[1:20:37] <%linearlinera> 1
[1:20:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:20:39] <+Deuce_Willington> When you dodge instead of parrying, that's giving up an opportunity to do Posture damage
[1:20:42] <+dheng1> Eye of the tiger
[1:20:43] <DianaTheAscian> 1
[1:20:44] <+NiktenKing> 1
[1:20:44] <%VJdarkworld> Tango down
[1:20:44] <RiceeFTW> @Pillagius still first playthrough lul
[1:20:46] <apostateCourier> parry spamming reduces your parry window and reduces the posture damage
[1:20:49] <%doughvatkyn> The bow attacks are so awesome it's fine too
[1:20:51] <FackinCrazy> @Pillagius !
[1:20:55] <FackinCrazy> 1
[1:20:55] <+HellCopter> using a bow at short range is cheating
[1:21:00] <Pillagius> @RiceeFTW awesome, aslo... no spoilers... OK :D
[1:21:02] <ClutchSuts> Good trade good trade
[1:21:04] <BabyNaBackbrace> Every time Geni jumps I hear "click click" of two parry attempts, just like I did this fight
[1:21:12] <VioletHeart> I mean to be fair Sekiro has a robot arm. Genichiro's allowed a boy.
[1:21:16] <+Deuce_Willington> if you never stop swinging at him, he can't use the bow lol
[1:21:17] <VioletHeart> A bow, sorry.
[1:21:21] <%doughvatkyn> ATTACK WITH THE BOY
[1:21:24] <%Solidnick18> oh

[1:21:47] <VioletHeart> Sekiro should have a dedicated Kuro button.
[1:21:48] <apostateCourier> there is no "cheating" in a fight to the death
[1:21:51] <Pillagius> @VioletHeart well... Sekiro has, a firearm Kappa
[1:21:54] <Man_in_the_Red> hay @WoolieVersus for an easier time with the game, unbind your dodge button and learn
[1:21:57] <primaryfire> Remember pat talking about the really long string on the podcast that leaves you back in neutral? that shit is sick

[1:22:22] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 Having an incredibly isolationist culture for millenia will tend to exacerbate qualities of that culture

[1:22:36] <+EySoyCoco> you can punish those sweeps almost free
[1:22:41] <Slimeking_Mike> @haveswordmuststing Mikiri counter though
[1:22:42] <$Louie_Salmon> I don't understand how one could possibly press in the left stick accidentally. Is this like how when I feel cornered in a fighting game, I just start hitting "get off me" and "get away" buttons, but for souls games?
[1:22:42] <+Deuce_Willington> Good attempt!
[1:22:45] <Fadedblank247> you're doing good Woolie
[1:22:46] <%QueequegTheater> Just do perfect 4Head
[1:22:48] <%doughvatkyn> oh no maybe rolling your finger over L1 and R1 too quickly
[1:22:48] <+EySoyCoco> good fight tho
[1:22:48] <+buttdirt> such a good fight tho
[1:22:50] <juxtest> Look at tha wiggly katana
[1:22:52] <BabyNaBackbrace> Second attempt almost got it
[1:22:52] <PsychicKirby> The only advise I would really offer him, as he is doing well, is unlike everything Pat told you 'HOLD YOUR SHIELD UP" (Your posture recharges faster)
[1:22:54] <DianaTheAscian> Alway Jump after he plunges down @WoolieVersus

[1:24:29] <Man_in_the_Red> @VioletHeart their good for deleting enemies and doggos
[1:24:29] <%Solidnick18> the panic crouch
[1:24:32] <aizt> i dont think woolz bought the fidget spinner
[1:24:34] <NaturalGear> Shuriken + followup is probably the most consistently good use of the prosthetic in the game
[1:24:35] <TrashLeviathan> @VJdarkworld its always ara ara day
[1:24:38] <Man_in_the_Red> and for cheap
[1:24:45] <DianaTheAscian> woolies doing pretty good on the health damage

[1:26:02] <+NiktenKing> NURUI!
[1:26:03] <Man_in_the_Red> because its that useful
[1:26:04] <+Deuce_Willington> YES
[1:26:06] <zamzoph> oh wow, Woolie hasn't been playing this much
[1:26:08] <+Deuce_Willington> GO IN
[1:26:09] <RoboXGP> He's the top student at Agehego academy
[1:26:10] <ClutchSuts> @haveswordmuststing I spammed firecrackers like no man's business
[1:26:12] <+EySoyCoco> @ClutchSuts anithing that jumps dies to it like that
[1:26:25] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Try to stop dodging, he doesn't have any grabs so dodging is actively suboptimal
[1:26:30] <+SvenHolgersson> Oh boy its the boi
[1:26:31] <aizt> EASY MODE Unlocked!
[1:26:31] <+Weeewer> wrong
[1:26:32] <castcola> spirit emblems
[1:26:38] <+Weeewer> Getting pushed back means you parried it correctly
[1:26:40] <juxtest> Get down with the sickness!
[1:26:40] <VioletHeart> No, the push-back is a perfect parry.
[1:26:42] <+Deuce_Willington> IF not in, THAN go in
[1:26:44] <DXLelouch24> Theater he does have a grab
[1:26:46] <Pillagius> man, letting genichiro go on offensive is punishing :(
[1:26:46] <%Solidnick18> it's got a rhythm to it
[1:26:47] <Unimpressions> as long as you parry that last hit in the combo you get push back into neutral
[1:26:50] <+dheng1> No it means you got it
[1:26:52] <Fadedblank247> yeah push back means you did good
[1:27:02] <castcola> here we go
[1:27:06] <+Deuce_Willington> You don't need them!
[1:27:06] <+loukemia83> its good learn the fight
[1:27:08] <%QueequegTheater> "I only used 600 in ten mintues WTF"
[1:27:11] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:27:25] <+SvenHolgersson> No emblems is when it gets real
[1:27:26] <+Deuce_Willington> The real emblems were in your heart the whole time!
[1:27:27] <PinkSocks> Wow, I never ran out in the whole game
[1:27:34] <rosemon5001> the arrogance of the man to use a bow in a sword fight
[1:27:41] <Shishi1205> No emblem run as intended
[1:27:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:27:46] <TrashLeviathan> @Deuce_Willington this isnt bloodborne
[1:27:47] <%doughvatkyn> There's a lot of hang-time in that jump and arrow spam.
[1:27:49] <%QueequegTheater> @PinkSocks Were you using ten shurikens on every single boss attempt
[1:27:56] <+velocitasfortis> !uptime
[1:27:56] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 39 minutes
[1:27:56] <VioletHeart> Arrows extend your air time. Duh.
[1:27:57] <%Solidnick18> ohh
[1:27:58] <%doughvatkyn> Someone's got him on wires
[1:28:00] <ClutchSuts> I'm gonna call my first child Mikiri Counter I love it so much
[1:28:01] <zamzoph> Woolie sure does like dodging
[1:28:01] <%linearlinera> i hope he gains the confidence to deflect that helm breaker
[1:28:02] <+SvenHolgersson> counter that man
[1:28:03] <+HellCopter> Every mikiri dodge is giving up stamina
[1:28:05] <DXLelouch24> Woolie sleepin on EASY Posture damage not parrying his multi strike attack
[1:28:18] <%QueequegTheater> @HellCopter Kappa
[1:28:18] <+Deuce_Willington> @leviathan666303 For this fight, specifically, it is. he can't really counter if you don't let up
[1:28:33] <%QueequegTheater> Thrust
[1:28:36] <TrashLeviathan> @DXLelouch24 woolie is schleep
[1:28:41] <+SvenHolgersson> naw that was a grab
[1:28:43] <PsychicKirby> He'll get it guys. He did just get here and doesn't have all his patterns down.
[1:28:57] <+HellCopter> Is "shooting arrows to propel yourself in midair" the most anime thing this game does?
[1:28:58] <%QueequegTheater> But chat demands blood now
[1:28:59] <+SvenHolgersson> 1 to go
[1:29:01] <%Solidnick18> alright
[1:29:02] <Jontman42> What's the game FPS on PS4?
[1:29:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Eat it
[1:29:05] <+velocitasfortis> Genichiro doing his long combo is like, "I'm just gonna swing my sword wildly in front of me - if you get hit, that's your fault!"
[1:29:05] <DXLelouch24> he grabs you and kicks you in the gut, thats his grab
[1:29:08] <%QueequegTheater> @HellCopter no
[1:29:10] <Man_in_the_Red> gotta love how scared woolz is of parrying the helm splitter
[1:29:15] <%doughvatkyn> no the most anime shit is in the temple
[1:29:19] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:29:22] <%doughvatkyn> the spinning air monks
[1:29:23] <VioletHeart> @HellCopter Not even close.
[1:29:24] <%QueequegTheater> @doughvatkyn which temple
[1:29:25] <snow_bush> Has woolie tried kicking him in the dick?
[1:29:30] <Pillagius> To think people doing "no damage taken, no block, parry only" runs...
[1:29:32] <Slimeking_Mike> It took me like a zillion tries to beat Genichiro too. It's okay if he fails for hours like the rest of us.
[1:29:33] <%Solidnick18> NICE
[1:29:38] <+EySoyCoco> YES THE GOOMBA
[1:29:39] <%Solidnick18> that's the good shit
[1:29:39] <Shishi1205> I want to see woolies reaction to lightning
[1:29:39] <worldbrand> get his ass
[1:29:39] <+SvenHolgersson> G O O M B A
[1:29:42] <zamzoph> he did a thing!
[1:29:43] <TrashLeviathan> @doughvatkyn you mean the badasses
[1:29:48] <+Deuce_Willington> I'm REALLY enjoying watching Woolie learn. You can see the steady improvements
[1:29:50] <%doughvatkyn> yes THE badasses
[1:29:52] <PsychicKirby> He's getting it
[1:29:56] <%QueequegTheater> @Pillagius For some bosses that's literally impossible
[1:30:01] <%VJdarkworld> GOOMBA STOMP activated
[1:30:16] <biggdaddymike> If you hold the block button it will remove posture much faster
[1:30:16] <DukeBlack_> HE'S DOING IT!!
[1:30:21] <Man_in_the_Red> anyone have a count on attempts
[1:30:28] <%doughvatkyn> goomba stomp is so satisfying
[1:30:32] <Slimeking_Mike> He stonp.....
[1:30:33] <%QueequegTheater> @haveswordmuststing 3 or 4
[1:30:35] <+NiktenKing> I like the ting sound on the last deflected charge arrow

[1:30:41] <PsychicKirby> @haveswordmuststing probably around 5

[1:32:28] <KeiPrime> you wa shock
[1:32:30] <thebehatted> LIGHTNING BITCH
[1:32:31] <$Big_Dream> gotta do it in the air
[1:32:32] <+Zayasu> cirSlain
[1:32:33] <+HellCopter> Thankfully removing his shirt lowers his defense lol
[1:32:35] <+Deuce_Willington> (He's still a scrub tho)
[1:32:37] <+SvenHolgersson> GWYNED
[1:32:39] <ahbhajit> what the fuuuuuu
[1:32:40] <%jinking79> become the lighting in the rain Raiden what wrong character
[1:32:44] <Bob8644> at least he won't have to do the whole fight over again if he dies...right?
[1:32:47] <Ashenik1> watch him 1 attempt this shit
[1:32:48] <zamzoph> Woolie dodging stabs makes me NotLikeThis
[1:32:48] <+velocitasfortis> I was wearing my weighted training armor!
[1:32:49] <%Solidnick18> ooooooo
[1:32:55] <+dheng1> You were the lightning in that rain woolz
[1:32:57] <Man_in_the_Red> Run away, wools Kappa
[1:32:59] <henshin2289> The two major issues you have that's making this way harder than it seems. You refuse to respect your opponent, and you're not managing your posture. Create space, and hold block.
[1:33:02] <Graxe_> And then Woolie uses the idol mid fight
[1:33:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WAY OF TOMOE BITCH
[1:33:04] <worldbrand> zigging when you shoulda zagged
[1:33:04] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:33:07] <Fadedblank247> nice attempt
[1:33:09] <$Louie_Salmon> It weirds me out that not a single person in chat has mentioned that Woolie is randomly crouching all the time. Has this already come up and everyone is over it?
[1:33:14] <TrashLeviathan> tomoe best girl
[1:33:16] <NaturalGear> You wa shocked
[1:33:18] <DukeBlack_> never hold back. Get in his ass
[1:33:19] <$Big_Dream> redirect only works in the air
[1:33:19] <SixthSun2> Now, don't fuck up the first two phases Kappa
[1:33:19] <gigacanuck> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:33:20] <+MagicBeanBurrito> only 1 red dot on the second phase at least
[1:33:21] <%QueequegTheater> @henshin2289 That is literally the opposite of Woolie's problem
[1:33:21] <+Caped_Eggy> Actually nice attempt
[1:33:27] <+velocitasfortis> Genichi-kuuuuun!
[1:33:29] <Bob8644> oh no...
[1:33:31] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> did woolz never got the mikiri counter ?
[1:33:33] <Fadedblank247> i just ran under him when i saw lightning lol
[1:33:34] <%QueequegTheater> @henshin2289 He's not going nearly aggressive enough
[1:33:35] <Slimeking_Mike> It's not enough to just win... One must... GET GOOD!
[1:33:39] <+NiktenKing> TOMOEDOU
[1:33:40] <+EySoyCoco> @henshin2289 WutFace
[1:33:41] <Man_in_the_Red> @henshin2289 but respecting the opponent means they regain posture, he just refuses to royal guard
[1:33:43] <%doughvatkyn> All Woolie needs to do is not strafe in Phase 3 so he can get the lightning timing down.
[1:33:50] <alexandrecau> I mean you had the goomba stomp done
[1:33:54] <captainnathaniel> after finishing the game you realize genishiro is just a punk
[1:33:56] <$Big_Dream> gen is where the difficultly spikes
[1:33:59] <+HellCopter> 2 bosses really
[1:34:03] <zamzoph> three bars
[1:34:13] <%doughvatkyn> You can sit still a lot in Round 3
[1:34:15] <DXLelouch24> oh theres SO much worse to come
[1:34:24] <PsychicKirby> Hey I mean he's getting better. If he improves Mikiu perries and jumping sweeps.
[1:34:27] <aizt> oh no
[1:34:27] <%jinking79> mini boss Real boss
[1:34:31] <+velocitasfortis> Genni definitely feels clownish by the end. Such a good early skill checkpoint though.
[1:34:35] <aizt> does he think the progress saved?
[1:34:53] <DXLelouch24> Minh dashed his hopes early
[1:34:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:34:56] <%QueequegTheater> Is he seriously dumping money into that shit LUL
[1:34:58] <+NiktenKing> no
[1:35:09] <Man_in_the_Red> @aizt he mentioned "perfecting phase 1"
[1:35:13] <DXLelouch24> you cant progress in the otheroutes anyways
[1:35:16] <+velocitasfortis> Wait, why save $40?
[1:35:21] <+loukemia83> why save any?
[1:35:23] <DXLelouch24> well i mean you can but youll die hard
[1:35:25] <%VJdarkworld> Learning mikiri counter and goomba stomps on him will be the key
[1:35:43] <%doughvatkyn> @velocitasfortis yeah sadly he's super easy once you get him down but he's one of the cooler fights in the game
[1:35:49] <Ashenik1> is this the hardest boos in the game ?
[1:35:56] <DXLelouch24> not even close
[1:35:56] <aizt> nah
[1:35:57] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 Not even top 10
[1:35:58] <%linearlinera> @Ashenik1 no way
[1:35:58] <TrashLeviathan> @Ashenik1 no
[1:36:04] <Man_in_the_Red> i forgett if theres anything special for speaking to Isshin early
[1:36:05] <Ashenik1> OK :D
[1:36:06] <juxtest> Gotta have some "flushing down the ressurection toilet" money
[1:36:08] <+NiktenKing> not even close
[1:36:09] <captainnathaniel> actually, he is a punk compared to the others
[1:36:11] <Nyckelus> @ashenik1 Not even close.
[1:36:11] <%doughvatkyn> sekiro makes me want to make save files for every boss so i can just repeatedly fight each boss without playing the rest of the game
[1:36:13] <DXLelouch24> Woolies still on the tutorial
[1:36:13] <%QueequegTheater> It's the best boss but nowhere near the hardest
[1:36:14] <aizt> this is just a gate
[1:36:14] <$Big_Dream> by the end of the game this boss is a joke
[1:36:17] <thebehatted> I mean if you got to phase 3 on your fourth attempt then you might beat this guy faster than you think
[1:36:19] <NaturalGear> @Ashenik1 It's pretty much the final tutorial boss
[1:36:20] <DXLelouch24> im not jking
[1:36:23] <Slimeking_Mike> @Ashenik1 Genichiro WISHES he was the hardest boss in the game.
[1:36:28] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You need to literally never not be going in on him
[1:36:30] <%jinking79> Revengeance
[1:36:33] <+Weeewer> Ichimonji beats both of his jump options
[1:36:34] <Ashenik1> @RupanSen OH BOI :D
[1:36:36] <+Weeewer> Its so damn good
[1:36:36] <clockworkyokai> whats the hardest boss?
[1:36:39] <zecht89> never stop attacking
[1:36:41] <%Solidnick18> he mixes it up sometimes
[1:36:48] <%QueequegTheater> Don't sidestep into counterattack
[1:36:58] <DXLelouch24> Woolies still in the tutorial, he just doesnt realize it yet
[1:36:59] <%Noble_judgment> Noble_judgment subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[1:37:03] <%QueequegTheater> His sweep will always catch you that way
[1:37:05] <+Deuce_Willington> How about "don't sidestep, ever"?
[1:37:10] <Man_in_the_Red> @Ayerf you could say the demon but it isnt a Sekiro boss, just a bloodborne boss put in for fun
[1:37:14] <Nyckelus> @ayerf Probably either the last boss or the last optional boss.
[1:37:15] <%QueequegTheater> @Deuce_Willington He does have a grab
[1:37:16] <PsychicKirby> Can just block the jump attack into lunging for the perry.
[1:37:16] <%Solidnick18> he want's that space
[1:37:23] <juxtest> Strike him with your violence
[1:37:28] <Graznyded> Geni is still a puppy
[1:37:30] <%QueequegTheater> PARRY
[1:37:35] <DukeBlack_> ichimonji is strong but it's not as fast as the first skill.
[1:37:52] <%doughvatkyn> @Ayerf depends on playstyle. the extra estate boss is harder for me than the main 2 final bosses
[1:37:54] <VioletHeart> Honestly the first skill trumps a *lot* of weapon skills.
[1:37:57] <+robobeau> Is Woolie using any candy?
[1:37:59] <%QueequegTheater> ALso Nightjar slash is literally Artorias's overhead
[1:38:04] <clockworkyokai> i'm up to my third fight against gen in the field after ashina is burning how many more bosses do i have left?
[1:38:05] <Novillion> Woolie: Well, I'm trying to X... Chat: LITERALLY NEVER DO X!!
[1:38:21] <castcola> How often did he land mikiri before?
[1:38:25] <Pillagius> @robobeau nope. not yet anyways
[1:38:27] <+dheng1> Your almost done
[1:38:28] <Shishi1205> the ai reads inputs
[1:38:39] <captainnathaniel> genichiro is the sakura of sekiro, he has a badass fight at the start, but is useless in the end
[1:38:46] <Ashenik1> Do you guys think AC Odyssey has a better story than Origins. Cause that one was trash...
[1:38:53] <+HellCopter> @Ayerf this is a blind playthrough, don't spoil nothing
[1:38:57] <PsychicKirby> He is still getting down health bars tho
[1:39:04] <gigacanuck> @captainnathaniel hold on, which Sakura are we talking here?
[1:39:11] <captainnathaniel> Naruto sakura
[1:39:12] <+EySoyCoco> the shadows in ths fight look amazing
[1:39:12] <JetpackMcQuack> @woolieversus remember that you can press A to jump
[1:39:16] <Nyckelus> @ayerf Not many I’m pretty sure. Have you fought the demon yet? If not then you should backtrack towards the beginning area.
[1:39:17] <DukeBlack_> I always went into this fight as if it was a dance. Count every strike and see how he reacts.
[1:39:20] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sbfpDattebayo
[1:39:21] <Shishi1205> I really hope woolie enjoys sekiro
[1:39:27] <gigacanuck> hmm I dunno, I don't ever remember her being useful or dangerous
[1:39:34] <%QueequegTheater> The best strategy is to constantly allow the boss to heal KappaHD
[1:39:40] <+Sendaar> I just kept waling on him until he forced me to stop
[1:39:44] <captainnathaniel> @gigacanuck her fight against the puppet master
[1:39:47] <apostateCourier> wools drive him into a corner
[1:40:00] <captainnathaniel> no, I don't remember his name
[1:40:01] <%Solidnick18> no heals rip
[1:40:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Glory of Ashina!
[1:40:06] <zecht89> man, don't let him regain his posture
[1:40:08] <RiceeFTW> if you're not attacking, you're deflecting, and if you're not deflecting, you're attacking
[1:40:12] <gigacanuck> yeah, but that wasn't until Shippuden, and really wasn't it the other puppetmaster who won that fight?
[1:40:15] <F_manS> use firecrackers if you want a free heal.
[1:40:18] <beatie_g> is this ng+?
[1:40:22] <juxtest> Let the guy with the bow dictate the range the fight takes place at
[1:40:23] <+velocitasfortis> Be aggressive, b-e aggressive! B-E A-G-G-R-I-S-S-I-V-E! *doot dooo doot dooo*
[1:40:24] <DianaTheAscian> no
[1:40:26] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Literally just go in on him and then keep going in
[1:40:29] <+NiktenKing> first run
[1:40:29] <+khalcipher> nope @beatie_g
[1:40:31] <beatie_g> ah kk
[1:40:34] <Man_in_the_Red> why are you talking about naruto in a convo about boss battles
[1:40:34] <PsychicKirby> @beatie_g first playthrough
[1:40:35] <+Sendaar> Yeah but the second form is actually easier as long as you don't panic
[1:40:37] <+velocitasfortis> kdubAYAYA
[1:40:45] <+dheng1> Beat him like he owes you money
[1:40:47] <gigacanuck> because someone brought up Sakura
[1:40:50] <@Menitta> fly. like a butterfly
[1:40:51] <+velocitasfortis> kdubHappy kdubGoldShrug
[1:40:54] <RiceeFTW> or just GIT GUD
[1:41:02] <presque> why are you scared of him when he's against the wall though
[1:41:03] <+robobeau> Gonads
[1:41:08] <Wofoeh> Sup chat
[1:41:11] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:41:11] <gigacanuck> but hey, Best Girl won in Naruto, so Sakura can go suck it
[1:41:13] <RiceeFTW> ahh los cojones
[1:41:17] <captainnathaniel> nah, actually her choices and quick thinking won the fight, the mangaka just forgot she existed after that fight I think
[1:41:18] <Wofoeh> Oh? NG+?
[1:41:19] <%VJdarkworld> BALLZ exposed
[1:41:33] <gigacanuck> after and before actually
[1:41:33] <Ashenik1> @Sendaar Dont panic =easy boss. Literally every souls boss ever
[1:41:38] <TrashLeviathan> @Wofoeh no
[1:41:39] <%linearlinera> woolie's still playing it too much like dark souls
[1:41:45] <%doughvatkyn> nah, panic and scream is the best
[1:41:47] <Divryne> Never back down nerd.
[1:41:51] <majesticpaladin> Just came by to say hi to everyone!! KonCha KonCha
[1:41:51] <RiceeFTW> @Wofoeh it's the year 2024, Woolie still is on his first playthrough LUL
[1:41:52] <+Sendaar> IMO you really shouldn't stop attacking until he forces a counterattack
[1:42:00] <DukeBlack_> Let Shura consume you Woolie.
[1:42:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:42:01] <+zanzibar_junker> Don"t worry wools, genichiro is a bitch. you for this.
[1:42:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he keeps being shocked you keep getting back up
[1:42:10] <castcola> @HonestHero hello
[1:42:12] <captainnathaniel> feels like the writer forgot every Naruto caracter besides the main cast, and he still forgot most of the main cast
[1:42:16] <OkamiDude15> sekiro : never stop going in lytMOTIVATED
[1:42:23] <+Sendaar> @Ashenik1 Yeah but like, if you just remember the lighting counter thing you basically win instantly
[1:42:33] <gigacanuck> that's honestly the worst part, there was a big cast and a lot of interesting characters
[1:42:37] <gigacanuck> such wasted potential
[1:42:55] <majesticpaladin> What’s chat talking about
[1:42:59] <TrashLeviathan> naruto was never good dont @ me
[1:43:04] <RiceeFTW> that happens a lot with most shonen though
[1:43:05] <gigacanuck> the wasted potential of Naruto
[1:43:08] <captainnathaniel> Naruto shippuden wasted potential
[1:43:09] <+velocitasfortis> Don't even really "need" the lightning counter. Just walk in and get a couple free shots while it zings over your head. kdubLUL

[1:48:57] <+velocitasfortis> He's only 40% if he's killed every miniboss up to this point.
[1:48:59] <+6PoundsofShrimp> I got to the monkey
[1:49:03] <+6PoundsofShrimp> and that's when I had to take a break

[1:52:33] <1MadLadd> "HEY, i have the memory of you escaping, coward!"
[1:52:47] <Graxe_> Mid-air Ichimonji
[1:52:47] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Look back at the dead ally to avenge them while they're still there
[1:52:47] <primaryfire> though the memory isdistant it provided sustenance for the wolf
[1:52:56] <Patzzki217> mid air combat arts + ichimonji is so good
[1:52:57] <+Weeewer> Air Ichimonji is fucking great
[1:52:58] <Fadedblank247> save up for that 5 cost breath of life Woolie, its really good
[1:52:58] <Man_in_the_Red> supress precense like a big man
[1:53:00] <+Weeewer> You dont have the wind up of it
[1:53:00] <+velocitasfortis> @6PoundsofShrimp I spent 100 hours on my first playthrough. Total time fighting bosses was about 8 hours, and a couple-hundred deaths. 92 hours of dicking around. kdubLUL
[1:53:01] <+zanzibar_junker> presence is better
[1:53:07] <RiceeFTW> air ichimonji is kinda nasty LMAO
[1:53:09] <NotEnoughGun> Woolie: Great sage of weeb, I beseech thee! WHY? Why Is Dead Souls the ONLY game to really acknowledge that Kiryu is a Living Legend who is directly superior in rank to Japan's Military Forces.
[1:53:10] <Graxe_> Take the stance in the air
[1:53:15] <RiceeFTW> HELM BREAKER
[1:53:17] <VioletHeart> I really strongly recommend pushing for the prosthetic arts.
[1:53:20] <VioletHeart> They're really good.
[1:53:20] <%sirisvirus> suppress sound is awesome
[1:53:22] <Shishi1205> it looks cool
[1:53:23] <Tucker0603> HM BREAKER
[1:53:26] <FackinCrazy> Get stealth
[1:53:27] <Patzzki217> it was my bread and butter for guys with sweep perilous attacks
[1:53:29] <+velocitasfortis> Always go for passives first!
[1:53:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ninja the streamer? :)
[1:53:47] <VioletHeart> Flowing water is crazy strong.
[1:53:52] <Nyckelus> Stealth and then Mikiri upgrade!
[1:53:55] <Man_in_the_Red> actually forget presense, get that
[1:53:55] <+Weeewer> Near the end of the game the only skills are cared about were karma raising ones lol. Once I got Mortal Deathblow and Ichimonji nothing really was missing from my kid
[1:53:56] <VioletHeart> And all the passives, really.
[1:53:57] <+Weeewer> kit*
[1:54:07] <+dheng1> Passive ability
[1:54:12] <Graxe_> Air Whirlwind Slash looks cooler
[1:54:16] <moonlitdream> inb4 he never uses it
[1:54:19] <gigacanuck> woolie, man go for the passives
[1:54:20] <Graxe_> Than Air Ichimonji
[1:54:25] <DXLelouch24> Spiriti Emblems are a waste of skillpoints skilltree wise
[1:54:28] <Man_in_the_Red> ... thats the worst upgrade ever...
[1:54:31] <0rond> the karma raising ones are so traaaash
[1:54:39] <+zanzibar_junker> that is goos
[1:54:44] <+Weeewer> @DXLelouch24 the hardest disagree I've ever seen
[1:54:45] <0rond> shadowrush is not as good or cool as it sounds
[1:54:46] <Fadedblank247> yeah shadowrush is awesome
[1:54:47] <VioletHeart> It's a shame a lot of the prosthetic tool follow-ups are locked behind upgrades, because it means you only get the *good* prosthetic powers after you have those.
[1:54:51] <+velocitasfortis> I was so pissed when I first bought the spirit emblem one, and realized it only gave me ONE extra.
[1:54:51] <+Weeewer> More Spirit Emblems = Good
[1:54:54] <Man_in_the_Red> <----
[1:54:57] <RyuuAoi> Stinger
[1:55:01] <Man_in_the_Red> <----- !!!!
[1:55:06] <+velocitasfortis> I pick them last.
[1:55:06] <+Weeewer> Considering how everything fun in the game uses spirit emblems lol
[1:55:07] <Bob8644> YAHOO
[1:55:09] <Graxe_> Stinger into Enemy Step
[1:55:11] <simulationbard> Stinger into enemy step
[1:55:11] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @Estuko
[1:55:11] <F_manS> @WoolieVersus for the spirit emblem upgrades I reccomend them as the very last thing you get.
[1:55:13] <biggdaddymike> EEEYEAH!
[1:55:14] <DXLelouch24> there are better things to spend skill points on, like stealth and healing when you beatblow
[1:55:18] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan sorry moobot
[1:55:18] <DukeBlack_> stinger + round trip?
[1:55:19] <+Ultimate_Edge> Its Stinger into Helm Breaker!
[1:55:23] <zecht89> you have double ichimonji, you don't need anything else
[1:55:24] <+Estuko> @haveswordmuststing <-- ! :)
[1:55:24] <DXLelouch24> Emblems wont make you last longer
[1:55:32] <captainnathaniel> the great shinobi huh? anyone with Naruto jokes want to jump on this one?
[1:55:33] <+loukemia83> stinger then air stringer
[1:55:37] <primaryfire> stinger into helmbreaker?
[1:55:44] <%Solidnick18> sbfpScared
[1:55:44] <0rond> you will get every single spirit emblem in the game, and you'll be lucky if you it let's you use the ability you want more than maybe 3 times per fight
[1:55:46] <+Weeewer> @DXLelouch24 I'd rather get a spirit emblem raise as opposed to an expensive special move when you can only equip one anyways
[1:55:48] <DukeBlack_> wait no round trip is different
[1:55:50] <+zanzibar_junker> enemy step
[1:55:56] <DXLelouch24> FOOL
[1:55:59] <+velocitasfortis> Extra emblems are only used for bosses, and even with all of the upgrades, you only get 5 extra, total.
[1:56:02] <0rond> it's 1 spirit emblem
[1:56:04] <DXLelouch24> deathblow heal is a passive
[1:56:04] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:56:19] <+Weeewer> Deathblow is the best skill in the game
[1:56:22] <Fadedblank247> if you run out of emblems you can still do the stinger part without the air launch
[1:56:24] <TalisKanju> Is that FUCKING BILLY?!
[1:56:28] <+Weeewer> Im saying after death blow and the passives I get spirit emblems
[1:56:32] <%reandgaf> reandgaf subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! wowie 5 months to the boy ty Woolie for being cool and next year is half a year

[1:56:36] <Slimeking_Mike> @TalisKanju yup
[1:56:40] <+zanzibar_junker> it's okay
[1:56:53] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus go for the 5 skillpoint skill, heals you each deathblow
[1:56:59] <+velocitasfortis> Living Force FTW...sometimes. LUL
[1:57:07] <+Weeewer> Get Mortal Deathblow, best skill
[1:57:10] <TalisKanju> HOLY SHIT, what's up Billy
[1:57:12] <Man_in_the_Red> @WoolieVersus word of advice, the special moves are nearly useless, even after the patch,
[1:57:19] <+HellCopter> Living Force ruuuuules
[1:57:23] <Man_in_the_Red> theyre great for style tho
[1:57:23] <captainnathaniel> living force, AKA the lord of light sword
[1:57:30] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpChar
[1:57:32] <0rond> with the 5 more spirit emblems you get from all the upgrades combined, you will cast any cool ability maybe 3 more times every fight, IF YOU'RE LUCKY
[1:57:35] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus get Mortal Deathblow, best skill in the game, ignore EVERYTHING till then
[1:57:38] <+HellCopter> Ashina Cross sucks unfortunately. Like really bad.
[1:57:39] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:57:42] <+velocitasfortis> It didn't seem that they really changed the spirit emblem cost vs. the utility of the abilities. Barely any difference.
[1:57:47] <ExistentialSteak> woolie big cum
[1:57:49] <biggdaddymike> SCHUM!
[1:57:49] <captainnathaniel> its not as good
[1:57:58] <OkamiDude15> no woolie dont be consumed by how hype it sounds. its kinda ass
[1:58:02] <gigacanuck> what's Mortal Deathblow do?
[1:58:04] <Man_in_the_Red> @WoolieVersus this is Ukyo, not Vergil
[1:58:08] <Man_in_the_Red> remember that
[1:58:15] <+robobeau> So... Woolie lustiong after that boss tech, huh...?
[1:58:20] <primaryfire> it gets more vergil than this, woolie
[1:58:21] <%Solidnick18> lytMOTIVATED Die
[1:58:22] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus unfortunately Ashina Cross sucks, there are much better combat arts later
[1:58:29] <%VJdarkworld> Vergil stance analysis
[1:58:29] <OkamiDude15> lytMOTIVATED cut you down
[1:58:32] <+velocitasfortis> Oh man, Wollie would LOVE the move you get for the "VERY BAD" ending...
[1:58:36] <+velocitasfortis> *Woolie
[1:58:40] <gigacanuck> SCHUM
[1:58:41] <+conqab> fkn kenshin
[1:58:43] <NaturalGear> TBH I was as hyped too when I saw it
[1:58:44] <Nyckelus> @haveswordmuststing He might find the actual Vergil move.
[1:58:44] <TalisKanju> Woolie is getting all of the good guys up in here
[1:58:45] <alexandrecau> sandbag it minh
[1:58:47] <Sapphire_Breeze> Kenshin
[1:58:47] <VioletHeart> There are so many cool combat arts.
[1:58:58] <+krispen_wa> TSUBAME GAESHI
[1:59:01] <+zanzibar_junker> how bad did they need leaping kick?
[1:59:05] <RyuuAoi> Naruto
[1:59:11] <OkamiDude15> all are swallows before regend
[1:59:16] <primaryfire> @nyckelus there is a literal judgment cut in this
[1:59:17] <Pillagius> The funniest thing - Woolie will get forcefully acquainted with that skill reaaaaaal good
[1:59:18] <+zanzibar_junker> nerf
[1:59:21] <Wofoeh> Chat, do I talk about a minor spoiler? Or not
[1:59:25] <Ashenik1> Do I have to read manga to understand streams ?? :<
[1:59:30] <TrashLeviathan> swallow is three strikes ?
[1:59:32] <Wofoeh> It’s a battle technique
[1:59:34] <Shishi1205> yes
[1:59:37] <spacecatstreams> probs not
[1:59:43] <NaturalGear> Mashiba
[1:59:47] <OkamiDude15> naw you gotta read the light novel and watch the stage play first
[1:59:47] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> @Wofoeh wait til he reads it
[1:59:48] <Jetsfantasy> Woolie wouldn't like spoilers in chat
[1:59:48] <Truebluemc> id avoid saying spoilers
[1:59:50] <Patzzki217> woolie sometiems reads chat so probably not
[2:00:16] <%VJdarkworld> Woolie should prob put in title or tags that its a blind playthro
[2:00:21] <RyuuAoi> Come on guys. Let's be fair. Let's not spoil the Woolie
[2:00:39] <Ashenik1> @Patzzki217 Billy should read the chat for him ...
[2:00:45] <aizt> ah yes, the classic sekiro stage play Kappa
[2:00:49] <Nyckelus> @turbosuplex3000 I know, I’m saying that Woolie might find it. It’s missable so Billy will probably tell him when the time comes.
[2:00:49] <Shishi1205> he is doing it
[2:00:59] <TrashLeviathan> @VJdarkworld woolie is always blind
[2:00:59] <+velocitasfortis> It's too bad one of the coolest moves is locked behind the worst ending. It's not that great of a move, but damn is it stylin'.
[2:01:03] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:01:15] <Man_in_the_Red> gotta hoard Spirit emblems like a dragon tho
[2:01:15] <+zanzibar_junker> better whif punish
[2:01:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat didn't spoil him on DMCV mechanics, only fair we don't spoil him on Sekiro ones
[2:01:24] <OkamiDude15> how cool is the move from the bad ending?
[2:01:25] <RyuuAoi> Do stinger
[2:01:31] <spacecatstreams> give billy the sticks
[2:01:34] <+Deuce_Willington> Swag
[2:01:35] <Blank9> the stinger sucks though, it's so slow
[2:01:35] <DXLelouch24> Swag wont help you, trust me
[2:01:37] <+velocitasfortis> All of it. All of the cool.
[2:01:44] <Wofoeh> @woolieversus do you want me to speak about a really minor spoiler? Or not
[2:01:51] <+HellCopter> The stinger is unblockable so it's real good
[2:01:51] <+velocitasfortis> Not very useful, yet I still use it. It's that cool.
[2:01:53] <Bob8644> TWEWY uses the word swag. a lot.
[2:01:54] <aizt> no spoilerinos
[2:02:06] <+zanzibar_junker> I can't for woolie to get to the other big event
[2:02:07] <+krispen_wa> BEST GIRL
[2:02:07] <Yung_FckUp> ...!
[2:02:08] <energywarning> ...!
[2:02:10] <Bob8644> it also uses the word meme.

[2:02:14] <RyuuAoi> Imma do that at the club tonight, Woolie
[2:02:16] <Pnuts_> octoNa octoNi
[2:02:17] <RiceeFTW> NANI!
[2:02:17] <+dheng1> Waifu attack
[2:02:37] <Wofoeh> *japanese noises of surprise*
[2:02:42] <NaturalGear> Isshin's the coolest character in the game, prove me wrong
[2:02:45] <%DedlokPM> woolieS woolieT

[2:03:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:03:30] <OkamiDude15> its pretty good
[2:03:35] <%Solidnick18> it's real good
[2:03:36] <RiceeFTW> the range is crazy good
[2:03:36] <Wofoeh> @rupansen wish I could, but he’s an old dude that hunts ninjas
[2:03:40] <Slimeking_Mike> Great for punishing whiffs
[2:03:43] <+Deuce_Willington> It's a thrust attack
[2:03:48] <+freakfullmetal2> doodGlare1 doodGlare2
[2:03:50] <+Sendaar> I never used it once
[2:03:50] <Nyckelus> It’s a basic move and is pretty much universally useful.
[2:04:00] <Pillagius> Greatsword?
[2:04:01] <Jontman42> Good for health damage
[2:04:11] <NaturalGear> @Wofoeh "a demon must be roaming the castle"
[2:04:14] <Jigokuro> tsosA1 tsosA2
[2:04:15] <Jigokuro> tsosA3 tsosA4
[2:04:21] <%Psyramics> its a thrust, it just does damage
[2:04:22] <+Weeewer> hehehe./..
[2:04:23] <RyuuAoi> "Bitch Stinga"
[2:04:23] <zargy> AYAYA Clap
[2:04:26] <+robobeau> BULLSHIT YES THEY DO
[2:04:26] <+linSP> you know when that symbol appears above your head? thats you doing it to them
[2:04:27] <+Deuce_Willington> There may or may not be a boss that knows the Mikiri counter and WILL punish you for it
[2:04:27] <Patzzki217> billie sending big lies haha
[2:04:28] <%DedlokPM> @Jigokuro AYAYA
[2:04:28] <Shishi1205> monkaS
[2:04:30] <Sapphire_Breeze> Crazy Talk Kappa
[2:04:30] <Slimeking_Mike> "No"
[2:04:31] <+velocitasfortis> 20% more damage for 2x frame timing, and does less posture damage than regular swings.
[2:04:33] <VaudeVille_Villain_> Billy don't lie to the man now
[2:04:33] <RiceeFTW> it does chip if they block
[2:04:36] <Wofoeh> DMC2 stinger
[2:04:36] <+HellCopter> The stab has a lot of utility
[2:04:39] <YamatoNoHasu> 1 enemy actualy does mikiri counter you
[2:04:41] <creamlight1> some enemies might do that
[2:04:47] <+velocitasfortis> But yeah, also does chip. I always forget that bit.
[2:04:48] <biggdaddymike> "Do enemies Mikuri counter you?" A few di
[2:04:50] <Wofoeh> They do tho
[2:04:52] <biggdaddymike> *do
[2:04:55] <Sapphire_Breeze> the range is the same I think
[2:04:57] <Nyckelus> NO ONE TELL HIM ABOUT THAT.
[2:04:59] <Patzzki217> that seems normal for me
[2:05:00] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> charge is for health damage not posture or clearing distance
[2:05:05] <Man_in_the_Red> extra tile
[2:05:05] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> That stab can get countered super hard
[2:05:06] <+Deuce_Willington> YES
[2:05:06] <+velocitasfortis> ^
[2:05:10] <+robobeau> Some bosses will ABSOLUTELY counter the hold R1
[2:05:12] <PinkSocks> It's just 1 boss, but yes
[2:05:12] <+NiktenKing> Back step into it I think
[2:05:12] <+MagicBeanBurrito> bosses will mikiri
[2:05:14] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus thrust does chip damage
[2:05:17] <+velocitasfortis> Slightly extra reach too
[2:05:18] <%Rawpost> like one boss does it
[2:05:19] <+Deuce_Willington> It's 100% a thrust attack
[2:05:20] <+HellCopter> One enemy in the entire game.
[2:05:22] <biggdaddymike> No Smoliers
[2:05:24] <+thackattack00> nah at least two
[2:05:25] <Blackjackal95> don't tell him
[2:05:31] <+velocitasfortis> Oh, compared to Ichimonji isn't really fair, LUL
[2:05:33] <Jontman42> Jesus chat you're bad at this
[2:05:33] <+dheng1> Spoil sport
[2:05:37] <+BomaZero> The stab is a thrust attack like enemies do to you, so they can't block it, they can only deflect it. They can block Ichimonji
[2:05:38] <RiceeFTW> Ichimonji is posture damage, thrust is for HP damage
[2:05:41] <Patzzki217> thrust has faster start up for lower range
[2:05:41] <+Deuce_Willington> It pierces Gaurd
[2:05:42] <OkamiDude15> thrust breaks through guard so the only way enemies can guard it is to parry the attack. the thrust does considerable damage to health
[2:05:43] <+Weeewer> ONE boss will Mikiri...
[2:05:44] <Slimeking_Mike> DOPPIO'S EPITAPH
[2:05:45] <+NiktenKing> try backstepping into the thrust
[2:05:45] <%Psyramics> Some bosses will Mikiri
[2:05:48] <+MagicBeanBurrito> one boss
[2:05:50] <+Deuce_Willington> But they usually parry
[2:05:50] <OkamiDude15> only one boss does mikiri
[2:05:51] <Truebluemc> the poke does more health damage
[2:05:51] <+thackattack00> It aint just one
[2:05:52] <%Psyramics> Most will not Mikiri
[2:05:53] <presque> thrust goes through blocks, enemies can only parry
[2:05:54] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Ichimonji is posture and the stab is raw damage
[2:05:55] <+HellCopter> That's a lie, there's a single enemy that mikiris.
[2:06:02] <dabar13> The charge goes through guards but it can be partied
[2:06:03] <Man_in_the_Red> dont tell him how many would mikiri
[2:06:06] <$Retrash> I think you can cancel the thrust by blocking but its been a while since I played
[2:06:10] <rad_dude123465> Only one
[2:06:20] <zamzoph> SO MUCH BLOOD
[2:06:21] <Man_in_the_Red> chat, the killers of hype suprises
[2:06:21] <dabar13> Or parried rather
[2:06:24] <Nyckelus> Goddangit people. All you had to do was not tell him about the one thing.
[2:06:35] <Slimeking_Mike> Offscreen Grind PogChamp
[2:06:37] <aizt> the one time mihn bothers looking at chat
[2:06:38] <+velocitasfortis> Can cancel any basic attack if you bock within the first five frames.
[2:06:42] <+MagicBeanBurrito> he asked but we should lie to him
[2:06:46] <aizt> and he tells woolie a thing he shouldnt know
[2:06:50] <+velocitasfortis> Er, 10 I mean
[2:07:07] <+Milpool> it does
[2:07:09] <Graxe_> Backstab Deathblows are stealth deathblows
[2:07:10] <DXLelouch24> it does
[2:07:11] <RiceeFTW> it does if it's from behind I think
[2:07:14] <Man_in_the_Red> @MagickBurritoh or just dont tell him unrelated stuff
[2:07:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> it does
[2:07:15] <juxtest> Butts
[2:07:19] <+arancet> any stealth kill
[2:07:21] <moogle_dood> Backstabs
[2:07:22] <+Zayasu> i'm a liar cirSmug
[2:07:23] <Jontman42> At least if you jump from behind
[2:07:26] <+Sendaar> Now Woolie, get ready to witness the most useless bonfire of all time
[2:07:28] <NaturalGear> chat lies sometimes
[2:07:38] <Truebluemc> backstab only
[2:07:40] <simulationbard> Chat always never sometimes lies
[2:07:42] <Graxe_> If you have the right abilities, you can do them during combat without needing to stealth
[2:07:42] <+velocitasfortis> 4 bonfires within 50 feet of each other
[2:07:46] <Pnuts_> that is true, that's why there is a skill to jump over and backstab for a deathblow
[2:07:49] <nmaten> Use it all the time its super good
[2:07:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's one of the best skills in the gaaame
[2:07:58] <RiceeFTW> sneak up on one, use it again, then get free backstab LUL
[2:08:01] <Jontman42> That's a bit close Sekiro
[2:08:03] <Patzzki217> umu
[2:08:04] <+krispen_wa> WAGA ARAJI
[2:08:06] <+MagicBeanBurrito> kiss
[2:08:15] <+BomaZero> Hey Woolie, your charge attack is unblockable, enemies can only parry it so it's good for HP damage.
[2:08:15] <Truebluemc> you can then deathblow others instantly
[2:08:16] <+velocitasfortis> "Wolf, follow me five feet over here for no reason."
[2:08:18] <Shishi1205> aruji
[2:08:29] <DXLelouch24> Bloodsmoke renders you completely invisible and you can basically backstab, walk behind another enemy, backstab, walk behind another enemy, you can chain bloodsmoke
[2:08:36] <+velocitasfortis> ^^
[2:08:45] <+velocitasfortis> Great for groups
[2:08:49] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Git gud or people get cancer
[2:08:57] <+velocitasfortis> kdubLUL
[2:09:03] <zamzoph> very important choice monkaS
[2:09:03] <InkyDraconian> I wonder if Sekiro is connected to darksouls or bloodborne lore wise
[2:09:10] <%VJdarkworld> Okami-yo...
[2:09:10] <+HellCopter> Speak to Emma about that
[2:09:13] <Jontman42> Genichiro has the shitty resurrection
[2:09:15] <+Deuce_Willington> Better Ressurrection
[2:09:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> he did
[2:09:16] <+velocitasfortis> Doesn't seem so, no
[2:09:18] <PinkSocks> He has shitty ressurection only
[2:09:25] <+Weeewer> He is asking for ressurection
[2:09:31] <simulationbard> Dragon's blood is better immortality, somehow.
[2:09:32] <Divryne> He has a budget res.
[2:09:33] <%doughvatkyn> he wants the good shit
[2:09:36] <+Deuce_Willington> Genichiro got the bootleg stuff on the corner
[2:09:39] <gigacanuck> eheheheh
[2:09:41] <DXLelouch24> WRONG
[2:09:42] <zamzoph> there's like four different kinds of immortality in this game
[2:09:45] <DXLelouch24> that comes later
[2:09:47] <TrashLeviathan> wrong
[2:09:47] <gigacanuck> so wrong

[2:09:56] <RiceeFTW> you get the dope prescription while genichiro has the pleb street bootleg shiet
[2:09:58] <Djinnazz> Wrong
[2:09:59] <%doughvatkyn> i love this choice

[2:10:04] <BabyNaBackbrace> This is the dumbest choice menu ever
[2:10:05] <alrobot2014> minh is his name @spacecatstreams
[2:10:14] <+velocitasfortis> Genni picked his res up at the local asian mart in the $3 aisle, next to a busted rice cooker and 40 copies of SPEED on VHS
[2:10:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:10:17] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Chat will alert you when it's coming
[2:10:18] <Truebluemc> he has walmart immortality
[2:10:20] <+conqab> it's not a real choice
[2:10:24] <+conqab> yet
[2:10:25] <spacecatstreams> i love you minh
[2:10:25] <SixthSun2> It is funny how it justifies the Help Kuro route

[2:15:50] <Nyckelus> Now we can explore multiple paths!
[2:15:52] <SixthSun2> We can't fit the dragon in the castle, the tears will have to do
[2:15:54] <jerkhov_> the poop of the dragon
[2:15:55] <+sundizzle> make that dragon cry
[2:16:07] <RiceeFTW> shed dragon skin
[2:16:09] <Jontman42> Turns out you could've just used any fluid from the dragon but eehh tears are more mystical sounding
[2:16:14] <Orenjevel> even a dragon may cry when it loses a loved one
[2:16:19] <%doughvatkyn> because 'secretions' isn't as metal as tears
[2:16:19] <gigacanuck> I mean, what do you want?
[2:16:25] <OkamiDude15> make the genichiro scream and the dragon cry
[2:16:27] <Slimeking_Mike> OOOOOOOO the slow pan... woolie is a man after my own heart
[2:16:28] <+velocitasfortis> It's a gracious gift!
[2:16:30] <+ballsack2020> cinematic scrolling
[2:16:34] <+Ultimate_Edge> I'm gonna show that dragon Best Friends Final and we'll have plenty of tears!
[2:16:34] <NeroInfinite> the piss of the dragon isn't quite as mystical sounding
[2:16:35] <gigacanuck> Do you want the solution to all this to be collecting the dragon's semen?
[2:16:36] <castcola> D:
[2:16:37] <gigacanuck> Do you?
[2:16:42] <%ozzrabbit> Hey, has the Moonlight Blade appeared yet?
[2:16:43] <RiceeFTW> "you must eat the most divine of all physical items: dragon excrement"
[2:16:44] <+sundizzle> Sekiro: Dragon May Cry
[2:16:47] <SixthSun2> Wow, wolf, really disrespectful to those ceremonial candles
[2:16:52] <+velocitasfortis> Let's go walkies!
[2:16:52] <usurper_sos> How do you jerk off a dragon?
[2:16:58] <zamzoph> I think this game's story is kind of the most bare-bones
[2:17:02] <gigacanuck> very vigorously
[2:17:02] <castcola> a really big club
[2:17:04] <zargy> stop knocking over the candles I'm sure Kuro took the time to light those
[2:17:05] <NeroInfinite> Very carefully is the answer.
[2:17:05] <SixthSun2> @Smart_ZaK1 With a lot of time and perseverence
[2:17:13] <NDenizen> Moonlight blade doesn't appear directly but it's theorised that a certain enemy wields it
[2:17:15] <zamzoph> which is funny considering they have the MC talk and all
[2:17:16] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:17:19] <+velocitasfortis> FOLLOW
[2:17:22] <gigacanuck> @NeroInfinite two kinds of people
[2:17:23] <+velocitasfortis> TEN FEET
[2:17:23] <+krispen_wa> At least the story isn't DkS2 levels of vague for the sake of vague
[2:17:25] <castcola> these candles
[2:17:28] <%doughvatkyn> see me over here
[2:17:32] <%doughvatkyn> 5 feet away
[2:17:34] <juxtest> It cost From 162 trillion yen to make Kuro walk across the room
[2:17:38] <+velocitasfortis> I PREFER THE LIGHTING OVER HERE
[2:17:39] <+Estuko> He's cute
[2:17:43] <+Zayasu> cirComfy
[2:17:43] <zamzoph> splinters tho monkaS
[2:17:47] <+ballsack2020> take two steps forward if you want to press square again!
[2:17:48] <jerkhov_> indoors
[2:17:51] <SixthSun2> It is traditional to not wear shoes indoors in Japan
[2:17:53] <Jontman42> That floor looks like it gives a lot of splinters
[2:17:53] <castcola> his feet are like cutting boards
[2:17:55] <mr_slaide> The Woolie is on the prowl.
[2:18:07] <OkamiDude15> what if kuro is like 40 but the dragons blood makes him physically age slower? lytUMMA
[2:18:08] <Slimeking_Mike> I think I like this game's story the most outta the souls games. Mainly cause of the Sake mechanic and because of how its themes manifest
[2:18:30] <RoboXGP> I spent like ten hours just playing in this area my first time
[2:18:39] <ECRead> maybe he doesn't need shoes and is walking on Divine Air
[2:18:39] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan when there's no button to pet
[2:18:43] <RiceeFTW> @grayjammer I think the story of this game is very well thought out, the side stories especially
[2:18:48] <ECRead> I'll see myself out
[2:18:50] <Patzzki217> @WoolieVersus make sure to go behind the walls here for some eavesdrop opportunities from time to time
[2:18:56] <mr_slaide> Why is Billy so much cooler than all of us?
[2:18:57] <+velocitasfortis> His feet literally can't be cut. Kid don't know about no shoes.
[2:19:08] <SixthSun2> No sword, only hug
[2:19:15] <SixthSun2> Hug only zone
[2:19:21] <%doughvatkyn> hug aru g
[2:19:25] <+velocitasfortis> I will hug him with my blade, and he will like it!
[2:19:37] <+sundizzle> its a safe zone like the temple
[2:19:39] <mr_slaide> Katana means sword hug.
[2:19:44] <$Grimpo96> Hugging menacingly
[2:19:48] <%swesterly> Hi Wooly and chat!
[2:19:54] <%doughvatkyn> open a window and let the winter in
[2:19:57] <+Despera__> Child shield
[2:19:59] <+Estuko> LUL
[2:20:00] <+HellCopter> They'd just tackle you
[2:20:00] <Parapattern> Use him as a shield
[2:20:01] <G0DKnight> Meat Shield
[2:20:02] <zargy> >risking harm to the kid D:
[2:20:09] <RiceeFTW> an immortal meat shield PogChamp
[2:20:10] <SixthSun2> I mean, most of the nation's defenses are already defeated, so....
[2:20:11] <%Gogogolem> @WoolieVersus The kid is actually totally invinceable.
[2:20:13] <Danger_douglas> that's pat logic
[2:20:13] <+velocitasfortis> He can't be harmed tho
[2:20:18] <+linSP> immortal != no pain
[2:20:23] <Jontman42> Just piggyback him everywhere
[2:20:24] <OkamiDude15> viable yes but it does make you an ass
[2:20:24] <simulationbard> Baby armor
[2:20:26] <NaturalGear> strap the kid on you as an armor
[2:20:31] <+NerevaRising> Take him to sculptor and make him turn kuro into an arm upgrade
[2:20:40] <SixthSun2> And then frank hangs him
[2:21:05] <SixthSun2> Same solution Hercules had for the Nemean Lion, to strangle him
[2:21:09] <+velocitasfortis> Pain is what helps us grow as people.
[2:21:10] <gigacanuck> is this the monkey?
[2:21:10] <SixthSun2> Funny enough
[2:21:11] <zamzoph> it was always there
[2:21:13] <PsychicKirby> Oh no
[2:21:17] <PsychicKirby> Mihn
[2:21:21] <PinkSocks> It's always there
[2:21:23] <zargy> LUL
[2:21:29] <+HellCopter> Shinobi magic!!
[2:21:30] <NeroInfinite> yes
[2:21:32] <PsychicKirby> LUL
[2:21:34] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:21:46] <SixthSun2> Yeah, that makes sense
[2:21:47] <Jontman42> Yup
[2:21:49] <VioletHeart> N- no shuddup, it works.
[2:21:51] <Graxe_> It's a secret tunnel
[2:21:54] <OkamiDude15> secret shinobi art
[2:21:55] <usurper_sos> No, it's science
[2:21:56] <+thackattack00> tunnel
[2:21:59] <NaturalGear> I think it's just a really looooong passage
[2:22:00] <RiceeFTW> secret tunnel song
[2:22:02] <zamzoph> IT'S MAGIC BabyRage
[2:22:05] <Ion_Laser> through the mountains
[2:22:06] <%VJdarkworld> Tunnel snakes rule
[2:22:12] <+HellCopter> @WoolieVersus If you look behind the wall it's a cave and a loading screen, probably just a long secret passage
[2:22:15] <RoboXGP> I've never seen this before
[2:22:16] <%doughvatkyn> a tunnel THROUGH THE TOP FLOOR OF A TOWER
[2:22:20] <%Gogogolem> @WoolieVersus Woolie you have a magic arm that is not mechanical but just bone and wood.
[2:22:24] <+linSP> i beat this game 3 times THERES A CAVE THERE?
[2:22:28] <castcola> oh
[2:22:29] <+MagicBeanBurrito> fuckin dragon blood immortality exist and you're surprised by magic distances
[2:22:31] <+Tuna_Can_0> yea the location doesnt work. The temple is pretty far away
[2:22:36] <Patzzki217> no shut up though
[2:22:39] <zamzoph> it's locked tho
[2:22:39] <@Menitta> Wolf took the kids
[2:22:44] <castcola> That's a pretty good tunnel
[2:22:49] <Graxe_> No, only shinobi can use the door.
[2:22:52] <%VJdarkworld> Wrong warp magic
[2:22:54] <Jontman42> But nah it was locked with a strong lock
[2:22:55] <RiceeFTW> it's a shinobi only magic door
[2:22:55] <Graxe_> Kuro can't go through.
[2:23:09] <usurper_sos> You can basically swim through this game in the sky, so anything is possible
[2:23:10] <+ballsack2020> nandato?
[2:23:18] <@Menitta> I'd like to speak with shinobi's manager
[2:23:19] <juxtest> Emma probably uses it to
[2:23:25] <OkamiDude15> if it was an actual tunnel that you could walk through it would be just as bad as the elevator in darksouls 2
[2:23:26] <sphereshots12> Wolf took the scenic route
[2:23:26] <Jontman42> "Hey you don't look so fucking miserable anymore"
[2:23:32] <NDenizen> Sky swimming is the best glitch in any game it appears in
[2:23:32] <zargy> yes it's a really long tunnel but it's a tunnel none the less
[2:23:38] <NDenizen> memories of Spyro 3
[2:23:45] <+krispen_wa> THICC wax
[2:23:49] <SixthSun2> Fat wax, nice
[2:23:57] <+ballsack2020> laump of PAT!
[2:23:58] <+Estuko> Roar!
[2:24:00] <gigacanuck> gotta start hitting up the thicc bitches to get their fat wax
[2:24:05] <SixthSun2> Just pour some fat wax on my blade to upgrade it
[2:24:13] <VioletHeart> Gouging Top is *really* good.
[2:24:42] <+HellCopter> Oil + fire = guaranteed stun for like 3 seconds
[2:24:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:24:43] <+Weeewer> fires amazing...
[2:24:48] <+Weeewer> it burns any enemy for DoT
[2:24:59] <+Weeewer> I use the charged one though, I think the second upgrade?
[2:25:14] <+NerevaRising> ninjutsu
[2:25:16] <Patzzki217> its the ninjutsu
[2:25:17] <RiceeFTW> that means you have enough for the ninjutsu
[2:25:19] <+HellCopter> Yeah the fully-charged blast. Plus oil or livng force
[2:25:19] <OkamiDude15> thats the ninjutsu you have equipped
[2:25:40] <+Weeewer> Exactly oil + fire = great combo for getting opponent HP down
[2:26:00] <zamzoph> Go see Isshin BabyRage
[2:26:12] <OkamiDude15> woolie can do round 2 now yeah?
[2:26:37] <%doughvatkyn> did he get the umbrella?

[2:30:41] <$Louie_Salmon> In my experience, all the souls-likes have been at least a kinda fun.
[2:30:47] <%swesterly> Probably The Surge

[2:31:10] <+krispen_wa> Lords of the Fallen wasn't fun
[2:31:12] <BabyNaBackbrace> I like Sekiro and need to finish playing it but for some reason I feel no urge to play it much
[2:31:18] <$Big_Dream> skeiro is good if you like aggressive game play
[2:31:18] <+zNargaa> @WoolieVersus you can farm emblems easily in the first few areas if you need em'
[2:31:18] <%doughvatkyn> souls formula is pretty versatile for action exploration
[2:31:19] <GoldeNOVA> I don't have a lot of hopes from the team of God Eater

[2:34:09] <Jigokuro> Mysterious AND unkown?
[2:34:09] <+conqab> not worth, ultimately
[2:34:16] <$Louie_Salmon> Yeah don't worry about it for the moment
[2:34:16] <natebud> Big end game item
[2:34:25] <+0oki> Not worth it
[2:34:26] <+Deuce_Willington> You're paying for the M Y S T E R Y
[2:34:27] <NaturalGear> it's more of a NG+ item

[2:36:26] <+dheng1> Kuro room
[2:36:29] <+Estuko> We get to explore Kuro's bedroom? PogChamp does he have a nintendo
[2:36:33] <+zNargaa> if you need money just pop a baloon and run through the hirata estate with killing everyone @WoolieVersus
[2:36:53] <b_fran> Pop the balloon after they're all dead
[2:37:05] <NDenizen> may as well just pop your balloons whenever, you get loads
[2:37:07] <Jontman42> You can kill everyone first without looting and then pop the balloon, still gives the bonus
[2:37:16] <shotgang86> pop a baloon while you are at it
[2:37:22] <SixthSun2> Actually, pop the balloon after killing everyone but before collecting @WoolieVersus Get to spend less balloons for more money
[2:37:28] <natebud> It's free money. Just pop it when you're in an area with a lot of enemies
[2:37:31] <+velocitasfortis> All the basic enemies in Hirata drop wealth baloons as well.

[2:40:32] <+Caped_Eggy> NANI!?
[2:40:33] <Yung_FckUp> give drink
[2:40:33] <Maids4lyfe> it's a protein in the egg that causes the allergic reaction
[2:40:43] <DukeBlack_> With Evil Yugi
[2:40:44] <RiceeFTW> The Tengu of Ashina
[2:40:44] <Blackjackal95> Does he look familiar?
[2:40:45] <Mendin> There's a thing hanging on the wall
[2:40:47] <Jontman42> That's rough
[2:40:49] <HyperBomb21> KAGE
[2:40:50] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @DRAGKUDO yeah when tea (idk her japanese name) works at the burger place

[2:41:46] <+Deuce_Willington> Batman
[2:41:49] <%doughvatkyn> if i was immortal and got my head off in a battle i guarantee you i'd be done fighting
[2:41:51] <Djinnazz> guys, relax
[2:42:03] <DukeBlack_> also so Emma doesn't see him
[2:42:05] <simulationbard> I assumed it was cause he's not supposed to be running around killing shit
[2:42:06] <+Deuce_Willington> The Lord of the Castle shouldn't be out fighting and crap
[2:42:06] <%guyalex> he's Batman
[2:42:11] <Jontman42> He just likes the nose

[2:42:39] <sarg1010> No no, Mortal of the Blade
[2:42:39] <Mendin> Even with Old Man-itis, Isshin Ashina is still one of/the biggest dick G in Japan
[2:42:44] <zamzoph> D E G E N E R A T E S
[2:42:45] <NaturalGear> degenerates
[2:42:52] <gigacanuck> DEGENERATES
[2:42:53] <Maids4lyfe> @Estuko yo
[2:42:59] <dukenux> Blade of the Mortal - it's especially effective against living things
[2:43:00] <Pillagius> @WoolieVersus giving booze to NPCs gives you some lore and their background and/or background of other characters
[2:43:03] <usurper_sos> Mortal of the Blood of the Blade of the Wolf
[2:43:08] <%doughvatkyn> i can barely find a good position to sit when watching a movie with my head firmly on my shoulders
[2:43:20] <NDenizen> it's a weird translation
[2:43:22] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:43:25] <DXLelouch24> it will make sense later shut up
[2:43:27] <NDenizen> it would be awkward to translated diretly
[2:43:32] <+Deuce_Willington> Remember that time he taught you the arts of the Ashina sword style because he thought you were pretty alright?
[2:43:32] <OkamiDude15> people die when they are killed woolie
[2:43:32] <%QueequegTheater> This sword has such a high Weeb stat that it does 90% Cringe damage
[2:43:33] <+Estuko> monkaS swords that kill people
[2:43:37] <@Menitta> NANIIIII
[2:43:38] <bentheshrubber> people die when they are killed :O
[2:43:38] <gigacanuck> BAKANA
[2:43:41] <dukenux> People die when they are killed by a sword
[2:43:42] <zamzoph> Kenshin is shocked
[2:43:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The Reverse Dagger from Tigtone lol
[2:43:46] <yukichocomilk> they have gone too far
[2:43:46] <BinaryShuffle> ばーばかな
[2:43:47] <+dheng1> Bakana

[2:43:50] <+dheng1> Nani
[2:43:54] <@Menitta> My sword has a gun on it
[2:43:55] <castcola> Blade of Severance?
[2:43:56] <+linSP> weapons make hurt :)
[2:43:57] <+Deuce_Willington> "Katana no Kill"
[2:43:59] <+klooswep> *gasp* the bullet pistol!?
[2:44:08] <+MagicBeanBurrito> RUDE

[2:44:28] <DukeBlack_> gives Sake to dying old man.
[2:44:32] <TrashLeviathan> @zamzoph dont we all
[2:44:32] <Mendin> "Giving back the gift? MORE FOR ME THEN, BOTTOMS UP"
[2:44:35] <Blackjackal95> @WoolieVersus it's actually supposed to be Blade of Severance
[2:44:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @ChoculaUltra He
[2:44:38] <gigacanuck> I wish my grandpa was this cool
[2:44:42] <DXLelouch24> lol "dying old man"
[2:44:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @ChoculaUltra Sorry, Isshin, He's too important to be reoccuring
[2:44:53] <+dheng1> Big dick isshin

[2:45:01] <%doughvatkyn> grandpa i know you're having fun but could you please close your legs when you're wearing the robe
[2:45:01] <Graxe_> And Lightning Arrow
[2:45:02] <gigacanuck> at their best, both of my grandfathers were only half this cool
[2:45:12] <%QueequegTheater> @Blackjackal95 "You want severance pay, HERE'S YOUR SEVERANCE PAY"
[2:45:12] <usurper_sos> Tomoe is the shit
[2:45:13] <NDenizen> he lets it all hang out
[2:45:23] <%ChoculaUltra> @CanadianAnimatorGuy true true, but the Tengu of Ashina isn't! Kappa
[2:45:31] <DukeBlack_> She was so hot he almost died
[2:45:31] <+krispen_wa> Tomoe Gozen?
[2:45:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @ChoculaUltra Oooo~ good point
[2:45:42] <+Deuce_Willington> YES
[2:45:44] <gigacanuck> uh bruh you're pretty close to death right now
[2:45:45] <+Deuce_Willington> 100%
[2:45:45] <+Caped_Eggy> Gotta be tomoe gozan

[2:46:24] <OkamiDude15> whens more naruto woolie
[2:46:34] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie just weeb your way through the demons
[2:46:35] <%ChoculaUltra> swept away~
[2:46:39] <Divryne> HESITATION IS DEFEAT.
[2:46:41] <bentheshrubber> 'taken in by her'
[2:46:42] <resloxxx> Hesitation means defeat SEKIRO
[2:46:46] <Pillagius> how awesome would it be if in the DLC you get a keepsake from Isshin about Tomoe and get to fight her in memories?
[2:46:48] <%QueequegTheater> YEAH WOOLIE
[2:46:51] <%QueequegTheater> GOOD ADVICE
[2:46:55] <NaturalGear> Look at the walls Woolz
[2:46:56] <Graxe_> Hesitation means that you aren't motivated
[2:47:01] <Graxe_> Or motivated enough
[2:47:03] <+dheng1> He telling you how to play
[2:47:04] <+dheng1> Lmao
[2:47:08] <%doughvatkyn> isshin channeling the chat
[2:47:12] <NDenizen> If you dont choose your actions quickly within limited time, it can lead to one's demise
[2:47:12] <+Estuko> monkaS

[2:47:20] <zargy> that doesn't usually happen
[2:47:27] <TrashLeviathan> ???????????
[2:47:30] <Ion_Laser> ???
[2:47:32] <happyskeret> It means slow
[2:47:35] <alexandrecau> we can hear you old man
[2:47:35] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!
[2:47:39] <NDenizen> get some confetti for that
[2:47:40] <Graxe_> Break some cups and alert the entire tower
[2:47:44] <Graxe_> Good job
[2:47:45] <%superc37> superc37 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[2:47:46] <RyuuAoi> Glitch
[2:47:47] <%QueequegTheater> Weeb is Japanese for reading the mind of your opponent
[2:47:50] <%doughvatkyn> hug the wall, it's lonely
[2:47:51] <Pillagius> huh... It looks like you've found Tengu of Ashina on the wall :D
[2:47:59] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie, have you ever been at a buss stop, and the buss just drives RIGHT PAST YOU without stopping?
[2:48:10] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:48:15] <DukeBlack_> and talking to NPCs
[2:48:28] <zamzoph> I wish there were more item descriptions in this game FeelsBadMan
[2:48:29] <NaturalGear> Item description, npcs, envirnoment
[2:48:34] <DukeBlack_> otherwise VaatiVidya wouldn't exist
[2:48:45] <Blackjackal95> occasionally even the environment and level design will have lore hints
[2:48:45] <%ChoculaUltra> mmm delicious eel liver.
[2:48:45] <+krispen_wa> Drink the Lore Juice to become stronger
[2:48:48] <+MagicBeanBurrito> SUCC that money
[2:48:49] <%QueequegTheater> It means nothing Woolie
[2:48:52] <+Deuce_Willington> Nah, there's probably no more
[2:48:53] <%QueequegTheater> No there isn't
[2:49:00] <ReloySpankins> wats vaatividya?
[2:49:01] <zamzoph> Exploration isn't as rewarding when you finding like the same dozen consumable items
[2:49:02] <+Deuce_Willington> You'll be fine
[2:49:03] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> @ozzrabbit it happened to him when was getting a taxi.
[2:49:05] <AncelDeLambert> wish I could play this game, but man are my nonexistent reflexes shot by old age
[2:49:19] <@Menitta> Oh my
[2:49:21] <+krispen_wa> He's motivated
[2:49:23] <TrashLeviathan> these guys are great
[2:49:36] <+dheng1> I hate these guys
[2:49:39] <+dheng1> So annoying
[2:49:40] <RyuuAoi> Get serious!
[2:49:44] <RoboXGP> the tengu are also very bird like
[2:49:49] <Pillagius> Eel liver? Maybe you were supposed to find it earlier so it tells you that you're eel prepared for the things to come? Kappa
[2:49:49] <usurper_sos> Yoo the air to air
[2:49:54] <+krispen_wa> That was anime as fuck
[2:50:00] <RiceeFTW> helm splitter bois
[2:50:01] <DukeBlack_> it's not worth it here
[2:50:06] <%QueequegTheater> WHY
[2:50:06] <%ozzrabbit> @youknowwhyimhere008 I’m mostly asking because that just happened to me right now.
[2:50:07] <%doughvatkyn> isshin contentedly listening to sekiro murdering his guards downstairs like 20 feet away
[2:50:11] <%doughvatkyn> just chugging sake
[2:50:13] <bentheshrubber> LUL
[2:50:15] <zamzoph> But what if you need that later?! D:
[2:50:23] <natebud> my favorite part about this room is that there's no point to it... yet
[2:50:26] <dreu81> Woolie is this possibly the coolest ninja/samurai game ever made?
[2:50:34] <SixthSun2> LUL those guys
[2:50:39] <+dheng1> Woolie has evolved
[2:50:41] <resloxxx> From time to time there will be opportunities to eaavesdrop Isshin and Kuro, look out for that.
[2:50:47] <SixthSun2> Minding their own business, then some ninja cuts through a wall
[2:50:50] <%ChoculaUltra> anyone see that Mysterious Heroine X mod for Sekiro? Top tier stuff.
[2:50:53] <bentheshrubber> dont get bum rushed by the samurai
[2:51:03] <Blackjackal95> just eavesdrop everyone as much as you can
[2:51:17] <OkamiDude15> @ChoculaUltra sounds rad. but is therean izou mod?
[2:51:18] <Blackjackal95> no privacy
[2:51:21] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> @ozzrabbit yeah he went into to it in detail in one of the podcasts
[2:51:21] <RyuuAoi> These fuckers BEEF
[2:51:26] <alexandrecau> so is wolf really small or ashinan are just taller than every other people
[2:51:30] <%QueequegTheater> That poor guard didn't even see the fucking ichimonji coming
[2:51:37] <+Caped_Eggy> Wolf is a smol boi
[2:51:43] <+krispen_wa> When is the big-tittied Miyamoto Musashi mod
[2:51:51] <RoboXGP> the immortal ties make them tall, also makes them easier to see while fighting
[2:51:51] <%ChoculaUltra> @OkamiDude15 oof I wish
[2:52:00] <RiceeFTW> @alexandrecau it's just fromsoft thing to have the badasses as super huge guys
[2:52:04] <OkamiDude15> big tiddy raikou mod
[2:52:21] <SixthSun2> RIP that old lady
[2:52:22] <zamzoph> RIP Grandma
[2:52:22] <+Deuce_Willington> I think Wolf is just crazy smol
[2:52:32] <cool_culainn> I can't believe sekiro dosent respect its player base enough for big anime tiddies
[2:52:34] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie can't help but waste emblems LUL
[2:52:44] <Blackjackal95> crazy smol is overexaggerating
[2:52:45] <zamzoph> @Deuce_Willington Wolf is like the shortest man in Japan
[2:52:52] <SixthSun2> Wolf probably has stunted growth from just consuming rice and sake all the time
[2:52:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:52:53] <+velocitasfortis> Wolf is about 5'6"
[2:53:00] <+velocitasfortis> Normal for Japanese man
[2:53:04] <gigacanuck> Japanese people are short
[2:53:07] <snow_bush> @zamzoph Incorrect, the Dwarves exist
[2:53:09] <+Deuce_Willington> @zamzoph Big poise for tiny bois
[2:53:09] <+crimsonharvest> anyone see the article about the origin of the anus ball snatchers
[2:53:12] <RoboXGP> that's racist!
[2:53:12] <OkamiDude15> so everyone else is really tall
[2:53:22] <snow_bush> @crimsonharvest Yeah, Kappas
[2:53:22] <+velocitasfortis> Isshin is just about 7' and Owl is goddamn 9'
[2:53:23] <gigacanuck> it's true
[2:53:24] <VioletHeart> They're only enemies for you. He's chill here because everyone in the castle is being hired to protect him.
[2:53:24] <OkamiDude15> @crimsonharvest kappas?
[2:53:25] <dukenux> The castle reminds me of that Hashimoto hit in Silent Assassin
[2:53:27] <%ChoculaUltra> would that make Owl like...7-8 feet tall?
[2:53:28] <VioletHeart> He is the lord here after all.
[2:53:30] <+crimsonharvest> yeah the kappas
[2:53:35] <%ChoculaUltra> holy shit 9 makes sense too
[2:53:37] <jubejube56> so Owl is a Chad?
[2:53:37] <RoboXGP> mongolians are tall
[2:53:45] <+Deuce_Willington> @velocitasfortis where did you find those numbers? Legit curious
[2:53:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Owl is the dad chad.
[2:53:53] <+crimsonharvest> they steal your solidified soul and eat it
[2:53:55] <+velocitasfortis> Comparison to scale
[2:54:06] <happyskeret> Wolf is 3 foot
[2:54:10] <zamzoph> I get the impression that Isshin doesn't give much of a fuck about anything
[2:54:11] <%ChoculaUltra> WHOS SNEEZING
[2:54:15] <VioletHeart> Who's talking?
[2:54:19] <DukeBlack_> I feel like that's the only thing that sucks about this game
[2:54:21] <%DedlokPM> mogsLoud WHO'S SNEEZING?
[2:54:26] <gigacanuck> sediment?
[2:54:27] <OkamiDude15> who's foot prints are these? lytTASTY
[2:54:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Deuce_Willington
[2:54:30] <%QueequegTheater> Sekiro: Manlets Die Twice
[2:54:32] <snow_bush> sipsipHellmo
[2:54:32] <gigacanuck> okay this is a plot development
[2:54:39] <jubejube56> Sediment...
[2:54:40] <usurper_sos> He ate dirt to become jesus
[2:54:42] <%doughvatkyn> eating dirt you mean
[2:54:50] <+Deuce_Willington> Woolie, stand next to Emma, see who's taller!
[2:54:50] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that wily Dogen.
[2:54:55] <%QueequegTheater> "Also it's probably fucking evil"
[2:55:12] <+zNargaa> 躊躇することは失うことを意味します
[2:55:19] <gigacanuck> "Okay but can I bang you, woman with a westerner name?"
[2:55:25] <jubejube56> @QueequegTheater if it is referred to as "sediment" you can be sure it is evil
[2:55:25] <+velocitasfortis> Wolf is barely taller than Emma. His eyes are about at her forehead.
[2:55:28] <%QueequegTheater> Minh you should probably steer Woolie towards the good ending
[2:55:43] <bentheshrubber> ^
[2:55:44] <+velocitasfortis> *did tons of scale comparisons one playthrough*
[2:55:47] <%doughvatkyn> steer woolie towards the bad ending for **THE MOVE**
[2:55:56] <Blackjackal95> IDK why people have such an issue with his height
[2:56:10] <+velocitasfortis> Probably because of Isshin, Owl, and Gyoubu
[2:56:12] <bentheshrubber> its more like his whole bodies scale
[2:56:12] <zamzoph> but where's the library?!
[2:56:14] <SixthSun2> Kuro, why'd you need to leave a note, the library is literally a few feet away
[2:56:15] <+velocitasfortis> They are HUGE
[2:56:16] <swamp_roo> b d e
[2:56:17] <%QueequegTheater> @Blackjackal95 Because he's like 5'6", it's unusual
[2:56:19] <+velocitasfortis> XBOX HUEG
[2:56:31] <%doughvatkyn> kuro has very little faith in wolf's sense of direction
[2:56:32] <+velocitasfortis> 5'6" isn't unusual for a Japanese man...
[2:56:34] <+Deuce_Willington> I actually kinda liked the idea that he was tiny.....
[2:56:34] <gigacanuck> that is a garbage library
[2:56:37] <Blackjackal95> not that unusual for japanese people tbh
[2:56:37] <bentheshrubber> like hes not just short but actually miniature
[2:56:39] <+krispen_wa> Woolie getting the bad ending for the move would totally be the most Vergil move of all time
[2:56:42] <OkamiDude15> owl is EA SPORTS BIG
[2:56:42] <Jontman42> He just wants to be helpful
[2:56:54] <%ChoculaUltra> thinking about it, Hanbei is a bit taller than Sekiro too
[2:57:05] <alexandrecau> snake eyes
[2:57:06] <@Menitta> I love that clan. Cute doggos
[2:57:07] <jubejube56> oh dear snake eyes
[2:57:10] <+Deuce_Willington> He smol, but he stab
[2:57:10] <+TheoTTree> GUN
[2:57:16] <dukenux> Okami Clan PogChamp
[2:57:17] <EyeFarted> GUN GIRLS!?
[2:57:19] <castcola> When do you fight Scope Dog
[2:57:21] <%QueequegTheater> @velocitasfortis It is when every SoulsBorne PC before him has been 5'10"-6'0" and he's noticeably shorter than every other man in the game
[2:57:25] <+velocitasfortis> Sculptor is really tall as well, now that I think about it. His shins are as long as Wolf's torso LUL
[2:57:26] <DukeBlack_> Emma Gunfort
[2:57:30] <RoboXGP> snake eye's is one of Odins descendants actually
[2:57:35] <dukenux> In Yakuza it would be a clan made entirely of dogs
[2:57:36] <@Menitta> Maximilian Gunfort
[2:57:41] <gigacanuck> oi lads it's the tomboys with guns clan
[2:57:44] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater Souls games are Western Fantasy, not Japanese
[2:57:46] <Blackjackal95> even if he is particularly short, what's the problem?
[2:57:50] <OkamiDude15> @Menitta sounds like a kof character
[2:58:00] <%QueequegTheater> @velocitasfortis Same developer
[2:58:04] <@Menitta> It does! LUL
[2:58:06] <zamzoph> Jeremiah Gunfort
[2:58:12] <%QueequegTheater> And a LOT of the same design foibles
[2:58:19] <+Deuce_Willington> @Blackjackal95 I like that he's short....
[2:58:21] <jubejube56> Gunfort is an excellent name for a tower defense game
[2:58:21] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater Developer doesn't matter. Setting does. Europeans are taller than Japanese people
[2:58:23] <resloxxx> @WoolieVersus From time to time there will be opportunities to eaavesdrop Isshin and Kuro, look out for that.
[2:58:27] <+krispen_wa> How romantic
[2:58:29] <+Estuko> "Woah, It's Pokemon Silver!"
[2:58:44] <%QueequegTheater> @velocitasfortis Where in Europe did DS2 take place, exactly?
[2:58:49] <%doughvatkyn> @resloxxx never stop spying on your friends
[2:58:54] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater Fantasy Land
[2:59:01] <+Caped_Eggy> Chu chu
[2:59:04] <%QueequegTheater> @velocitasfortis EXACTLY
[2:59:04] <zamzoph> @Blackjackal95 No problem. We can just make fun of Wolf. Like we do Pat.
[2:59:05] <bentheshrubber> not in the south east asian part of europe thats for sure
[2:59:07] <+Estuko> kissu
[2:59:09] <alexandrecau> Ok but does wolf wants to give up his immortality? like fells he is just going along with the kid
[2:59:17] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater This is Japan, not European Fantasy Land
[2:59:28] <jubejube56> @alexandrecau wolf doesn't really have a character
[2:59:32] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater Never been a Japanese knight
[2:59:43] <NDenizen> its weird how little I care about lip synch and animations when they're gone
[2:59:45] <RoboXGP> ds2's asylum is in france, the cathedral is in italy or around there, the iron keep is in prague ect, but fantasy
[2:59:46] <jubejube56> he follows the iron code until you tell him otherwise
[2:59:48] <+Deuce_Willington> @alexandrecau Because it's literally killing everyone around him
[2:59:50] <%QueequegTheater> @velocitasfortis Where in Japan is Ashina Castle? Be specific, please. Also, Japanese knights were called samurai
[2:59:52] <energywarning> man, my master sure is a massive nerd
[2:59:52] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:00:01] <usurper_sos> I mean, there are Samurai
[3:00:12] <+Estuko> How can the young lord possibly be this cute?
[3:00:13] <Blackjackal95> as a short person myself it just feels a bit depressing that people freak out about male characters who might be even remotely on the shorter end
[3:00:17] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater You're being intentionally obtuse.
[3:00:17] <gigacanuck> My Little Master Can't Be This Cute!
[3:00:24] <alexandrecau> @Deuce_Willington they can be treated and it's only if he dies often
[3:00:36] <DianaTheAscian> how are there former heirs of the divine dragon?
[3:00:36] <dukenux> Well, DS was very much a fantasy alternative world in the vein of Forgotten Realms or sth like that
[3:00:42] <%QueequegTheater> @velocitasfortis No, I'm pointing out that FROM intentionally deviated from their norm, and people are surprised by it
[3:00:45] <RoboXGP> the soul of the wolf
[3:00:45] <castcola> what
[3:01:07] <%QueequegTheater> Wollie dying
[3:01:07] <dukenux> Sekiro might be this OR it might be "somewhere in Japan", just like for example Wakanda is a place "somewhere in Africa"
[3:01:08] <+Arkfyre> Fragrance of the tears of the butt of the dragon of the soul of the blood of the wolf
[3:01:09] <OkamiDude15> woolie got dragon rot NotLikeThis
[3:01:13] <castcola> rip
[3:01:15] <TrashLeviathan> oh no woolie has the dragon rot
[3:01:18] <+Estuko> monkaS dragon rot
[3:01:21] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater They made a Tenchu game, which was set in Japan, just as Sekiro is. They also made Armored Coire games, which were set all over the planet.
[3:01:22] <%doughvatkyn> disregarding hydrationbot
[3:01:26] <RoboXGP> all of the locations tho are based in reality, they're basically the models for the game
[3:01:33] <DianaTheAscian> Back in the day
[3:01:40] <%QueequegTheater> It's okay dragon rot doesn't kill anyone
[3:01:42] <@Menitta> Fruits Basket was the show my sister monopolized the TV with DansGame
[3:01:48] <+crimsonharvest> i remember selling fruits basket manga back when Barnes and NOble first started carrying it
[3:01:52] <zamzoph> there's a punch girl in Fruit Basket?! I thought it was a story about having a dude harem
[3:01:54] <%jinking79> skip School Day

[3:02:07] <+crimsonharvest> hi 5 azumanga
[3:02:08] <+velocitasfortis> @QueequegTheater They made a Tenchu game, which was set in Japan, just as Sekiro is. They also made Armored Core games, which were set all over the planet. The only "norm" you're comparing to is the Souls series. You're being intentionally obtuse, so I'm done here.
[3:02:17] <jubejube56> Nothing slices life quite like Madoka Magica
[3:02:18] <gigacanuck> @ChoculaUltra soon
[3:02:18] <OkamiDude15> woolie do you like power vocals and punch girls? watch symphogear

[3:02:32] <alexandrecau> so date gaiden
[3:02:38] <TrashLeviathan> if you like slice of life "miss kobayashi's dragon maid " is my personal fav @WoolieVersus
[3:02:51] <%QueequegTheater> @velocitasfortis Oh you mean their last five games, four of which saw massive international recognition? Nobody hears FROMSoft and thinks AC or King's Field anymore
[3:02:55] <gigacanuck> >liking slice of life
[3:02:58] <bentheshrubber> (though not applicable to the argument)
[3:02:59] <@Menitta> talk to the people

[3:07:58] <%QueequegTheater> Minh have you played Spec Ops: The Line
[3:08:04] <$BioStormX> Woolie we were talking about futanari while you were gone
[3:08:09] <FackinCrazy> @WoolieVersus Minh LIKES FUTA DICK
[3:08:10] <0rond> whatever happened with your insomnia?
[3:08:11] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus we almost got u banned
[3:08:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Futanari is going on Woolz
[3:08:16] <+Estuko> Ffs
[3:08:16] <bentheshrubber> woolie just missed the best ama ever
[3:08:24] <DianaTheAscian> Futa is life
[3:08:24] <+razielhex> @QueequegTheater That would murder his innocense
[3:08:26] <+Anonymasque> Uh excuse me Happy Fun Times is best Tag. And Vanilla. You degenerates!
[3:08:27] <+TheoTTree> Nah fuck that
[3:08:30] <%swesterly> Spec OPs is babby's first Heart of Darkness
[3:08:30] <cool_culainn> Excuse me
[3:08:41] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus That's a bit much, but it's real good
[3:08:44] <tattleworm> ehhh, it's neat, but i wouldn't go that far
[3:08:51] <+TheoTTree> The game is way overhyped because it makes no use of games as an interactive medium and guilt-trips you for things you have no control of
[3:08:53] <alexandrecau> spec ops lp with minh and reggie
[3:08:54] <Jetsfantasy> I'm glad I played it before everyone hyped it up so much
[3:08:56] <RyuuAoi> It's confirmed! Billy said so! Aya Brea Has Come To
[3:08:57] <FackinCrazy> Oh god that game is so fucking overrated
[3:08:59] <TrashLeviathan> its good but not amazing
[3:09:01] <NaturalGear> It's Heart of Darkness The Game
[3:09:01] <biggdaddymike> Next Woolie Versus Spec Ops The Line?
[3:09:04] <Animal_Farm4> It's not super long, could probably blow through it in an evening
[3:09:10] <+krispen_wa> Spec Ops would work if it wasn't so boring that you quit before it actually got to the message
[3:09:12] <presque> spec ops only works if you're a FPS player
[3:09:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's LP-able
[3:09:13] <+TheoTTree> It guilt-trips you for, essentially, not turning the game off and not playing the video game that you bought
[3:09:15] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It's less than 8 hours
[3:09:16] <%DatAsuna> Spec ops is LPable
[3:09:19] <majindusto> "Aya Brea"
[3:09:23] <+Weeewer> I hope Woolie plays Ace Attorney some day
[3:09:24] <+razielhex> It's literally HoD recontextualized to the GWOT, like Apocalypse Now! is HoD Recontextualized to Vietnam.
[3:09:29] <+Weeewer> I'd love to see him throught process through the cases
[3:09:34] <%ChoculaUltra> finish Assault Spy you coward~
[3:09:35] <%hazzy_o7> It's very linear and straight forward gameplay wise.
[3:09:38] <FackinCrazy> Like its fine but that moment that everybody talks about isnt shit compared to some shit
[3:09:38] <%DatAsuna> You do it in 15-20 episodes depending on how bad you are
[3:09:39] <+velocitasfortis> Would have been a bit more effective if it didn't force you into specific actions just to go "AHA! You are the monster!"
[3:09:40] <%QueequegTheater> Pretty standard 3rd person shooter
[3:09:42] <+crimsonharvest> cant be worse than the gameplay of that werid japanese robot squad based shooter
[3:09:43] <%DedlokPM> Third Person Shooter IIRC
[3:09:43] <DukeBlack_> it's a little fun
[3:09:43] <%DatAsuna> Third person cover shooter
[3:09:44] <biggdaddymike> Third person
[3:09:48] <+krispen_wa> If you played it, you totally would recall it Minh
[3:09:53] <seylumiue> Give us that skindentation
[3:09:55] <GoldeNOVA> It's a very average third person shooter
[3:09:57] <%QueequegTheater> Chat completely missing the point of the game
[3:10:00] <$BioStormX> FUTANARI
[3:10:02] <+Estuko> BILLY NO
[3:10:02] <%QueequegTheater> FUTA
[3:10:04] <Divryne> Spec Ops is a great bait-and-switch game.
[3:10:05] <%doughvatkyn> billy you can't take it back
[3:10:05] <+razielhex> Spec Ops: The Line can be done in about 6-7 hours straight.

[3:18:44] <bob_the_eskimo> It's up for debate BioSormX
[3:18:48] <%QueequegTheater> @leviathan666303 Okay, Round 1 is 1 Shakedown vs Mr. X, Round 2 is three Shakedowns vs. Nemesis
[3:18:48] <usurper_sos> You can get emblems through combat and in the environment
[3:18:52] <gigacanuck> in fact, he's such a shota I'm tempted to think Emma is ARA ARA'ing him offscreen
[3:18:52] <+velocitasfortis> Shirafuji is at Goon Fart
[3:19:01] <Nyckelus> The lord is a shota not a loli.
[3:19:03] <%DJ_Light> fufufu
[3:19:12] <%QueequegTheater> @Nyckelus Where's the proof tho
[3:19:19] <+Estuko> How can the young Lord possibly be this cute?

[3:20:02] <Nyckelus> @queequegtheater I’m pretty sure that Owl specifically refers to Kuro as a he in the beginning cutscene. Unless I’m mistaken of course.

[3:21:02] <RoboXGP> i have to watch Seven Samurais this guy is on the front cover
[3:21:14] <Nyckelus> @alexandrecau I mean, having an in-game character’s word for it is better than speculation at least.
[3:21:15] <%QueequegTheater> @leviathan666303 Kiryu can dodge

[3:22:25] <%QueequegTheater> @leviathan666303 Yes
[3:22:39] <jubejube56> Kiryu at least knows his way around women
[3:22:40] <+velocitasfortis> So make them play Bloodborne?

[3:24:24] <jubejube56> @QueequegTheater It is hard to say. I think both would take a nerf, but Kiryu would bounce back with the power of love or something
[3:24:37] <+velocitasfortis> SURPRISE BOSS!
[3:24:40] <Graxe_> Fight for Buddha
[3:24:52] <%QueequegTheater> Kill God
[3:25:02] <charlatancain> FIght Buddha
[3:25:03] <TrashLeviathan> this place is pretty cool
[3:25:05] <Parapattern> Buddha LOVES violence
[3:25:17] <FackinCrazy> Kiryu has been raped at least once if sub stories are canon

[3:25:27] <%QueequegTheater> DEW IT
[3:25:29] <jubejube56> if Asura's Wrath taught me anything, it was that Buddha is an end boss
[3:25:39] <arkv01> and from that day on, his name was Succiro
[3:25:55] <jubejube56> @leviathan666303 jesus has a DP
[3:25:57] <alexandrecau> jesus wins we saw what he can do with a whip
[3:26:01] <usurper_sos> Basically, git gud
[3:26:04] <Twilightalchemy> !uptime
[3:26:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 37 minutes
[3:26:11] <+DeaconBluesClues> I came in on the line "you need TWO rare consumables?!"
[3:26:15] <%jinking79> don't fight it yet
[3:26:15] <+robobeau> What you need is the Lilac umbrella
[3:26:16] <gigacanuck> @jubejube56 end boss in Asura is actually something from Hinduism, your victory is symbolic of Buddhism being superior
[3:26:16] <OkamiDude15> jesus has a godlike cross up
[3:26:24] <+Caped_Eggy> You don't need the agent, it's good to have it tho
[3:26:25] <Graxe_> Did Buddha have an infinite in Fight of Gods or was that Jesus? Or did they both have infinites?
[3:26:33] <NaturalGear> you can also fight him with a prosthetic tool later on
[3:26:39] <+linSP> you CAN do it with one confett, but TWO is super likely, and if you cant do it in one, you lose one
[3:26:40] <cool_culainn> Jesus had rekkas
[3:26:40] <+velocitasfortis> Aw c'mon Woolie, you had Pat ranting at you about this for like thirty minutes. kdubLUL
[3:26:54] <TrashLeviathan> jesus has his stand [ holy ghost ]
[3:26:59] <jubejube56> @gigacanuck well I figured I had a good change of being completely wrong. Good to know

[3:27:15] <Parapattern> Good instincts Woolie
[3:27:24] <%jinking79> and the strength sugar for the boots
[3:27:33] <%QueequegTheater> Jesus has an amazing parry game

[3:27:42] <%DedlokPM> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:27:45] <jubejube56> Jesus also has resurrection
[3:27:50] <snow_bush> Headless are worst mechanics

[3:28:12] <SixthSun2> Burning
[3:28:14] <usurper_sos> 5 heals
[3:28:18] <%ChoculaUltra> i-is...Sekiro secretly a Jesus game?
[3:28:20] <SixthSun2> Red Healing Gourd
[3:28:28] <+velocitasfortis> Jesus reincarnates once. Buddha reincarnates an infinite number of times, in different forms each time.
[3:28:35] <Legendary2bASS> Healing gourd that decreases terror
[3:28:49] <DePhat1> Mottled Purple Gourd
[3:28:52] <+G_Thunders> @rupansen right. I meant more like, the rewards > consumables in your inventory. So might as well try
[3:28:53] <+velocitasfortis> Ultimate spawn abuse!
[3:28:56] <jubejube56> is Sekiro a Mormon game? Do they drink coffee in this?
[3:28:57] <Truebluemc> there is a terror gourd
[3:29:06] <zargy> you really smoked that rooster out
[3:29:07] <+linSP> infinite anti terror
[3:29:11] <+DeaconBluesClues> can you save scum these fights
[3:29:14] <VioletHeart> There are ways around the confetti thing too.
[3:29:15] <Legendary2bASS> 5 charges that is refillable
[3:29:19] <Nyckelus> The poison Gourd doesn’t heal poison but gives more resistance towards it instead.
[3:29:21] <+sundizzle> I didn't even touch headless before I had the gourd
[3:29:35] <SixthSun2> NGL, Refillable consumables for status ailments is a godsend
[3:29:36] <%hazzy_o7> The game auto saves constantly
[3:29:42] <%FrostedZaibatsu> @jubejube56 what?
[3:29:48] <+velocitasfortis> Definitely nice
[3:29:53] <%DedlokPM> Kill all the mogsChicken s
[3:30:05] <Legendary2bASS> yeah, it's weird, that the status gourds don't actually, remove the debuff, just the buildup
[3:30:07] <GrandMazterNelson> echii mungu birb
[3:30:12] <+sundizzle> wait why didn't he rest
[3:30:13] <Graxe_> Those gourds don't remove the status, though. That's the drawback to them so as to not make the consumables useless.
[3:30:38] <%DJ_Light> terror gourd removes buildup i think
[3:30:52] <+sundizzle> all gourds remove build up, but they don't cure
[3:31:01] <Nyckelus> @dj_light It certainly can’t heal instant death.
[3:31:08] <NaturalGear> @Graxe_ Once your terror bar fills completely you die anyways
[3:31:12] <Truebluemc> i thought poison one was the only one that didnt heal
[3:31:25] <+sundizzle> fire gourd doesn't heal either
[3:31:45] <%Rawpost> gourds are for resistance not builup
[3:31:46] <usurper_sos> Ghost puppers
[3:31:57] <+velocitasfortis> Yes, buildup. Not cure
[3:32:00] <Parapattern> A literal ghost bitch
[3:32:01] <+sundizzle> @Rawpost that's not true
[3:32:03] <+jetjagger222> forrest whittaker
[3:32:03] <Patzzki217> that wouldnt matter for terror anyway haha
[3:32:05] <Truebluemc> oh i never actually used the fire one so was not aware

[3:48:09] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:48:14] <Legendary2bASS> code vein is weeb souls
[3:48:20] <MayorRev> YEAAAA
[3:48:20] <seylumiue> We just saw a monkey with a samurai hat and a katana, thats pretty weeb
[3:48:25] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Japanese fantasy I guess doodAnime
[3:48:38] <+sundizzle> for someone who plays fighting games, woolie doesn't go in
[3:48:40] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Final Japanese Fantasy
[3:48:42] <SirDogBear> this game is highly disappointing, sekiro doesn't do a naruto ninja run, might as well put it in the trash bin
[3:48:53] <gigacanuck> do we want to posion this guy or burn or what?
[3:48:56] <gigacanuck> oh
[3:49:00] <gigacanuck> just stealth shsin
[3:49:03] <Legendary2bASS> monkey with a katana but not doing sick flips. So, just fantasy

[3:49:04] <gigacanuck> *again
[3:49:10] <Ashenik1> Is Sekiro not really good after the first beating ?
[3:49:14] <+sundizzle> you can't stealth him twice, he'll reset his life bar
[3:49:14] <gigacanuck> oh too late
[3:49:19] <MayorRev> ewww
[3:49:24] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus His hand attack is not a grab, you have to deflect it
[3:49:29] <+velocitasfortis> Sekiro actually gets better on th second playthrough
[3:49:31] <Legendary2bASS> weeb shit is doing back flips and shit with the occasional edgy shit. While contemplating on their dark past
[3:49:33] <usurper_sos> You want to run around and hit him in the back

[3:49:48] <Legendary2bASS> nop
[3:50:00] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @legendary2bass Truth
[3:50:02] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Don't jump to the right, that's where his fist is coming from
[3:50:07] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie stay topped off
[3:50:17] <Legendary2bASS> isn't there a soft cooldown on the firecrackers?
[3:50:26] <+velocitasfortis> Yep
[3:50:26] <resloxxx> Yeah
[3:50:32] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Hesitation is defeat
[3:50:39] <Legendary2bASS> like 20secs before they get stunned again
[3:50:41] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Legendary2bASS so by default Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is the most anime one
[3:50:45] <henshin2289> less jump, more fight
[3:50:46] <SirDogBear> i actually like ng+ for this game too, makes you feel kind of like a speed runner
[3:50:48] <+velocitasfortis> Especially when it's a huge fat guy you can just do rings around kdubLUL
[3:51:02] <%QueequegTheater> PAUSE
[3:51:02] <+sundizzle> woolie really needs to stop hard blocking
[3:51:06] <Legendary2bASS> Yes! MGS is Peak weeb with old men.
[3:51:09] <+Sabre_Basilisk> go in jeez
[3:51:09] <MayorRev> good try
[3:51:17] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Blocking is poisonous to this game, you need to try parrying
[3:51:17] <KillMyPast> Drop your shield
[3:51:18] <%doughvatkyn> yeah he tags you when you jump
[3:51:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No MGyS TS specificall
[3:51:23] <SixthSun2> How are these large boys not affected by the poison they spit out
[3:51:25] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Die doodScrub
[3:51:30] <%Psyramics> should never hard guard, always go for the deflect
[3:51:34] <+sundizzle> just remember to never stop GOING IN
[3:51:44] <+velocitasfortis> I think the firecracker cooldown for Juzou/Tokujiro is about 10s or so. Don't think it's as long as 20s. Some bosses do have that long though.
[3:51:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> kill all the chickens
[3:51:52] <%QueequegTheater> That doesn't work
[3:51:53] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @sixthsun2 Tolerance maybe coxBut
[3:51:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I kind of wish all the MGS series got the Twin Snakes treatment with cutscenes
[3:52:09] <+velocitasfortis> The LD50 for a guy that size is pretty big
[3:52:10] <dreu81> And if you can, try to neutral jump his sweeping sword strikes and jump off his head
[3:52:11] <SirDogBear> but because they drink so much alcohol burning them is kind of effective
[3:52:20] <gigacanuck> burn him alive
[3:52:23] <Legendary2bASS> MGSV lacked cutscenes overall, lmao
[3:52:26] <SirDogBear> too bad flame vent costs so much lol
[3:52:30] <+velocitasfortis> Someone should check the MSDS on the poison he spits.
[3:52:40] <Legendary2bASS> didn't they adjust flamevent to 2 SP?
[3:52:42] <+sundizzle> flame vent is too expensive and too risky
[3:52:50] <SixthSun2> WOO
[3:52:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes gotta gun!!!
[3:52:56] <SirDogBear> oh snap really? thats game changing then especially with living force if its only 2sp
[3:53:14] <Legendary2bASS> flame vent and axe is more of a position and timing thing
[3:53:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> C'mon Woolie stop monkeying around
[3:53:23] <Legendary2bASS> the windup is so fucking slow
[3:53:30] <%QueequegTheater> Jesus Woolie is really scared of going in ever
[3:53:34] <+velocitasfortis> C'mon man, it's just a monkey with a sword!
[3:53:39] <SirDogBear> i love axe a lot first play through because of poise, but then i realize the cult of umbrella and never returned
[3:53:42] <Patzzki217> 2 drink for monky
[3:53:42] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Does Woolz have the whistle?
[3:53:44] <+Estuko> feel when prob more than half of chat would die to monkey with sword monkaS
[3:53:55] <+G_Thunders> Mist Noble is gonna wreck him
[3:53:55] <%QueequegTheater> Even though this game actively rewards aggressive play
[3:54:00] <Legendary2bASS> go in with sugar
[3:54:02] <GoldeNOVA> That's no Samurai, that's a Sarurai
[3:54:04] <+sundizzle> I haven't watched the beginning of the playthrough, but has woolie not learned to parry
[3:54:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Crab with Sword is unstoppable
[3:54:20] <usurper_sos> He knows how
[3:54:21] <Ashenik1> @QueequegTheater Even with the Monkey Boss?
[3:54:21] <%QueequegTheater> @sundizzle He has but he thinks blocking is better
[3:54:23] <arkv01> OH LAWD
[3:54:23] <Legendary2bASS> he knows how to parry. It's just the timing
[3:54:24] <+velocitasfortis> Counterpoint: Hit its weak spot for massive damage
[3:54:24] <arkv01> HE COMMMIN
[3:54:27] <+sundizzle> @QueequegTheater oh no
[3:54:36] <%VJdarkworld> Everyone gangsta until the monkey picks up a katana
[3:54:40] <Legendary2bASS> he should actually do the parry dance. Where you spam that shit
[3:54:45] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 That's a puzzle boss more than an actual encounter
[3:54:52] <+sundizzle> parry spam is way better than blocking
[3:54:55] <resloxxx> SUGOI
[3:54:56] <Legendary2bASS> yep
[3:54:58] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Does Woolz have the whistle?
[3:55:00] <+starzo0> a monkey with basic understanding of a sword would absolutely kill me
[3:55:05] <Ashenik1> @QueequegTheater not this monkey boss
[3:55:05] <+velocitasfortis> Nah, it's not a problem until they pick up *two* katanas... kdubS
[3:55:07] <usurper_sos> You can attack in between parries
[3:55:15] <+Croire> I think a monkey with a sword would kill a lot of people
[3:55:18] <Legendary2bASS> whistle is at the deadlast phase of the game, my guy
[3:55:43] <+Estuko> When that one guy at work who clearly doesn't brush in the morning tries to talk to you
[3:55:48] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 Ah yes, the other one. That one absolutely rewards aggressive play. You pretty much have to get his vitality down
[3:55:51] <+sundizzle> @Legendary2bASS not true, you can get it before even getting close to this area
[3:55:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What would Woolie need the Warp Whistle for? Kappa
[3:55:52] <ArthurDoyleRPG> But that depends on his route
[3:55:56] <%callowheart> woolieMIRIN
[3:56:01] <presque> you can pause the game
[3:56:02] <Chester_goes_Berserk> There's a gif out there of a m
[3:56:18] <SirDogBear> the whistle can lead to a possible tactic if you get the gun monkey
[3:56:20] <alexandrecau> see this is why knowing sekiro's height matter, I'm not sure if the glutton is tall or he is just fighting pat
[3:56:22] <Chester_goes_Berserk> onkey walking into a camp with a shotgun and soldiers freaking out
[3:56:23] <Legendary2bASS> hmmm.. I guess, so but the boss there is one of the prerequisite for the last phase, isn't it?
[3:56:38] <Ashenik1> @QueequegTheater Even after it enters its enexpected phhase?
[3:56:42] <SirDogBear> but its the dishonorable way, but you are a ninja...
[3:56:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:56:54] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 Spoilers man
[3:57:01] <Legendary2bASS> there is very little honor if you are a ninja, lmao
[3:57:08] <+sundizzle> @Legendary2bASS the boss at the end of depths is a requirement yes, but the whistle is from the first monkey fight
[3:57:19] <ArthurDoyleRPG> On no we're getting Dragon rot doodDoom
[3:57:25] <SirDogBear> woolie got this though hes really close he gonna wreck him soon
[3:57:37] <Ashenik1> @QueequegTheater I dont know how to phrase it diffrently :< and Woolie doesnt read the chat so you know
[3:57:50] <+velocitasfortis> That's one thing people seem to not understand. You're a NINJA, not a samurai. You're a sneaky assassin, not a warrior. Be a cheap bastard! LUL
[3:57:52] <Legendary2bASS> @sundizzle is it? I thought you get with poopy monkey boss.
[3:58:12] <+Zayasu> cirSmug
[3:58:16] <%callowheart> OMG That monkey has a KATANA! slash slash slash
[3:58:17] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 I'd say it rewards aggression for sure, just learn when to jump
[3:58:18] <+velocitasfortis> OMG
[3:58:27] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @legendary2bass Yes
[3:58:30] <Patzzki217> bruh
[3:58:32] <Professor_Rakor> Usually death edges you can't fall off. If it's safe below you can usually just walk off.
[3:58:36] <usurper_sos> You can just mash against them
[3:58:37] <+starzo0> woolie beat snake eyes shirafuji, i believe in him
[3:58:37] <Nyckelus> @legendary2bass Yea, that’s the first monkey fight.
[3:58:44] <+sundizzle> @Legendary2bASS yes, that's the fight I'm talking about. the valley and the depths are two branches, you can finish one area without going to the other
[3:58:50] <KillMyPast> Shurikens can 1 shot monkeys
[3:58:50] <henshin2289> lol no respect
[3:58:51] <Legendary2bASS> ahhh
[3:59:07] <+Estuko> @TheyCallMeVawn shit they can one shot me LUL
[3:59:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie's weak to drunks
[3:59:18] <Legendary2bASS> been a long time, since I played and is actually why this game is great due to the amount of branches you take
[3:59:26] <%QueequegTheater> You die when you are killed
[3:59:34] <%callowheart> Imagine if the monkey had...A GUN!
[3:59:40] <%QueequegTheater> EQUIP POISON CURES WOOLIE
[3:59:47] <Professor_Rakor> You're killed when you die....twice.
[3:59:48] <Legendary2bASS> haven't gotten the whistle when I got here as well
[3:59:53] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @queequegtheater I love saying that too doodGood
[4:00:04] <+sundizzle> @Legendary2bASS yeah, I'm close to getting my 4th ending, so I've invested time in different branches lol
[4:00:23] <%VJdarkworld> GOOMBA
[4:00:26] <Legendary2bASS> I will never get the bad ending. It breaks my heart everytie
[4:00:28] <Ashenik1> @QueequegTheater Would you say this is the hardest souls game?
[4:00:36] <%QueequegTheater> @Ashenik1 yes
[4:00:42] <%QueequegTheater> But it's not a Souls game
[4:00:52] <%QueequegTheater> Not even in the way BB is
[4:00:54] <Ashenik1> you know what i mean ;d
[4:00:57] <+Zayasu> why is woolie jumping so much
[4:01:05] <%QueequegTheater> @reiju_22 Because DMC
[4:01:05] <ArthurDoyleRPG> I want to get all the endings but I end up playing Ffxiv instead LUL
[4:01:06] <Legendary2bASS> hard and easy at the same time. In a weird way
[4:01:07] <henshin2289> idk man
[4:01:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yeyeye
[4:01:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> close

[4:01:24] <SirDogBear> i feel ya @Legendary2bASS but if you don't you don't get the coolest looking battle art in the game even if it is useless
[4:01:25] <+G_Thunders> I think it’s the hardest Souls game for sure. The learning curve only gets steeper the further you go

[4:03:17] <gigacanuck> Woolie stop, there's only so much beer in my fridge
[4:03:18] <%QueequegTheater> Parries are BY FAR the safest option, as they block all attacks except sweeps and grabs
[4:03:19] <Professor_Rakor> Are you ready for the most intense combat...you've ever seen?
[4:03:32] <+velocitasfortis> You're already dead.
[4:03:43] <Graxe_> It's a cyanide pill, but back in Japan before there were pills
[4:03:44] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:04:05] <henshin2289> yeah but the I frames on jump aren't reliable seeing as most enemies attack on reaction meaning that 9/10 the blow will land after the I frames
[4:04:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You kill people to build up the gauge
[4:04:13] <+HellCopter> @WoolieVersus The blank ink goes away after you kill a heath bar. This lets you revive despite that penalty
[4:04:16] <Legendary2bASS> It's weird. The last time I watched woolie playing sekiro. Minh is a way new. Now he is the Master, lmao
[4:04:25] <Professor_Rakor> Bite down let's you use your extra reses like a bad healing item. essentially
[4:04:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> But the ink blot stops you from rezzing one after the other, so the Bite Down is useful for that
[4:04:32] <FackinCrazy> It lets you rez again if you have extra pips
[4:04:50] <+zanzibar_junker> goddamn phone keyboard
[4:05:14] <Legendary2bASS> bite down is way too complicated to use for normal players. It's a strategic item
[4:05:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ive never used "Berserk" items
[4:05:25] <SirDogBear> that sugar is insane against some bosses if you willing to risk the low hp
[4:05:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> it seems too risky when youre already making mistakes
[4:05:36] <Truebluemc> like if you know for sure you will die. bite down to allow you to use another res without needing a deathblow
[4:05:38] <MONSTR_UwU> Ako gummies
[4:05:45] <+starzo0> our boy billy soushi2Maxed his knowledge of the game and StinkyCheese
[4:05:46] <+sundizzle> I've only ever use the stealth candy
[4:05:56] <+S7R4W83RRY> Yashariku is 30% buff. Akko is only 15%
[4:05:57] <Legendary2bASS> Ako sugar is great. Too bad it lasts like a wet noodle
[4:05:57] <Truebluemc> it is a 200IQ play
[4:06:01] <Nyckelus> Yashariku is actually really strong but the posture bar becomes super small. You have to be really aggressive to use it well.
[4:06:03] <gonvern15> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli not a fan of beast pellets?
[4:06:06] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Half + Half = Double (Woolie math) LUL
[4:06:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @gonvern15 ive used the other sugars but that one
[4:06:21] <+velocitasfortis> Suicide pill requires being very aware of your health and supplies.
[4:06:23] <Legendary2bASS> Yasharaku is for baller players that have mastered the parry
[4:06:27] <Professor_Rakor> Prepare your butt wools.
[4:06:32] <+Estuko> NOPE it's View-Ti-Ful JOE
[4:06:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Oh god hardest boss

[4:12:28] <+velocitasfortis> Joffrey's headless body gets the throne
[4:12:35] <%DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus And you know why they did it that way: "BECAUSE IT IS SO HARD TO DEPICT PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH CGI DOGS! DON'T MAKE US DO IT!" teenREEE
[4:12:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dungeons and Dragons ruined Game of Thrones
[4:12:40] <SirDogBear> at least the dog got cool new owner now
[4:12:41] <Legendary2bASS> Hey! DnD is way better than GoT
[4:12:48] <Legendary2bASS> GoT only has sex
[4:12:48] <gigacanuck> @simulationbard because the anime went to shit once they got ahead of the manga
[4:13:00] <Professor_Rakor> The headless is still a normal headless.
[4:13:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> and I have not watched GOT either, another topic Im thankfully out of the loop for
[4:13:05] <alexandrecau> @simulationbard tomb of horror
[4:13:09] <simulationbard> @gigacanuck I hate when that happens
[4:13:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> RIP F :(
[4:13:29] <+Sabre_Basilisk> So i had a whisper from a guy offering free itunes vouchers
[4:13:38] <Legendary2bASS> GoT is DnD for normal people who never wanted to play DnD and only got interested , CUZ BOOBIES and INCEST
[4:13:38] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Where's the proper French dub as intended
[4:13:42] <Graxe_> Buddha is pleased
[4:13:45] <%QueequegTheater> @Sabre_Basilisk He's gonna steal your dick
[4:13:46] <+Estuko> @Sabre_Basilisk heard that's been going around, if anything just block LUL
[4:13:48] <DrStinkers> Just regular rot
[4:13:50] <%Solidnick18> @Breakfast_Megapowers it's not that good tbh
[4:13:50] <Professor_Rakor> People only get dragonrot once they meet you.
[4:14:03] <usurper_sos> Boobs and incest is just GoT for normies
[4:14:05] <Legendary2bASS> DUCK MAN HYPE
[4:14:07] <MONSTR_UwU> DuckerZ man
[4:14:09] <+velocitasfortis> Dragonrot is Sekiro's VD
[4:14:15] <Parapattern> @Legendary2bASS When they say D&D they're referring to the show's main writers
[4:14:18] <%DJ_Light> your DnD games dont have boobies and incest?
[4:14:21] <+Estuko> shotoDuck
[4:14:24] <simulationbard> @alexandrecau Never played tomb of horror, I don't have much experience with DnD.
[4:14:27] <Legendary2bASS> Dick and Dick?
[4:14:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is Duckman a rapist because he is part Duck? Inevitably yes

[4:15:38] <@Menitta> Dickman
[4:15:41] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Max fall damage is 40%
[4:15:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Nutman
[4:15:57] <+velocitasfortis> IIRC fall damage to the ground doesn't kill you unless it's far enough to hit a kill plane. You just drop to 1hp
[4:16:02] <Truebluemc> vitality from deathblow tho
[4:16:06] <+zanzibar_junker> presence
[4:16:13] <Nyckelus> Gravity has sadly been nerfed in Sekiro.
[4:16:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> X has got to go through Nutman's stage and bust him
[4:16:15] <%QueequegTheater> YOU MIGHT NEED THEM LATER
[4:16:17] <+MagicBeanBurrito> much closer to ashina cross
[4:16:18] <Professor_Rakor> Well....when liam was trying to bull skip glitch for funzies, we found that fall damage doesn't kill you. unless it's a respawn level fall.
[4:16:18] <%Psyramics> spend them on the heal-on-deathblow
[4:16:20] <energywarning> i'm beautiful? BibleThump
[4:16:26] <+sundizzle> healing deathblow is so good
[4:16:28] <%Nomad_Scholar> a Stinger that goes only 2 feet forward
[4:16:34] <NaturalGear> top one
[4:16:35] <+sundizzle> its in ashina
[4:16:37] <Graxe_> It's that one that's 5 points up there
[4:16:37] <%Solidnick18> the deathblow that get's health is amazing
[4:16:40] <+velocitasfortis> Requires 5 points
[4:16:48] <%Solidnick18> yep

[4:17:00] <usurper_sos> IT is the best one

[4:17:16] <NaturalGear> it gives you lots of survivability
[4:17:17] <+sundizzle> you deathblow EVERY enemy
[4:17:17] <Rngiddion> it is literally the best skill for exploration
[4:17:19] <+zanzibar_junker> a great one
[4:17:20] <+velocitasfortis> Mibu Village is absolutely fantastic for grinding points
[4:17:22] <Legendary2bASS> instead of healing, you can just kill
[4:17:25] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It is LITERALLY the best skill in the game
[4:17:31] <%Psyramics> its one of the most useful abilities in the game
[4:17:33] <Tremerss> you deathblow every enemy in the gamewoolie
[4:17:35] <%Solidnick18> it's very good and you don't have to use medicine as much
[4:17:38] <MONSTR_UwU> it's mainly for mobs
[4:17:39] <KoyFoster> Does he not know what a deathblow is?
[4:17:45] <%QueequegTheater> Oh my god Woolie
[4:17:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:17:46] <+Sabre_Basilisk> Deathblow everything
[4:17:50] <%QueequegTheater> 5
[4:17:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Life bar is worthless as long as you never get hit
[4:17:55] <+sundizzle> 5
[4:17:57] <TrashLeviathan> it says 5
[4:18:00] <+Zayasu> 5

[4:18:13] <Legendary2bASS> smol screen is smol
[4:18:14] <+velocitasfortis> DnD
[4:18:15] <energywarning> but what if you need that deathblow LATER though?
[4:18:20] <+sundizzle> also stealth is super useful
[4:18:25] <+IamGrapes> uh oh does Woolie needs glasses?
[4:18:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Just never get hit.... its an OP strat
[4:18:29] <Legendary2bASS> you ARE a NINJA
[4:18:33] <MONSTR_UwU> all passives are 10/10
[4:18:35] <Legendary2bASS> LUL
[4:18:37] <%Nomad_Scholar> better to have it and not need it , then not have it and need it
[4:18:43] <NaturalGear> skill bush
[4:18:44] <usurper_sos> It's a skill waterfall
[4:18:46] <austincoool> skill BUSH
[4:18:48] <Professor_Rakor> I think shinobi eyes is waaay more useful than very small amount of healing
[4:18:49] <henshin2289> you're at a super easy farming point
[4:18:50] <Rngiddion> skill loop
[4:18:52] <castcola> It's a Sphere Grid Kappa
[4:18:53] <gigacanuck> alright guys I'm checking out
[4:18:55] <NiftyNox> Skill curriculum
[4:18:57] <EyeFarted> SKILL SPIDERWEB
[4:18:58] <+duskrush> skill circuit board
[4:19:01] <+velocitasfortis> Oh man. I didn't realize he was missing so many of the best skills
[4:19:04] <Legendary2bASS> I thought you like different?
[4:19:04] <+zanzibar_junker> presence is 10
[4:19:08] <Legendary2bASS> LUL
[4:19:10] <UnfilteredComic> ???
[4:19:10] <austincoool> SKILL MAZE
[4:19:26] <+linSP> its just a skill tree with branches that converge
[4:19:26] <%QueequegTheater> What the fuck is Woolie saying
[4:19:40] <%Fantography> Fantography subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[4:19:41] <+velocitasfortis> SPHERE GRID!
[4:19:43] <NaturalGear> what are you talking about Woolz, that's how literally every skill tree works
[4:19:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie is saying he hates Skill Trees
[4:19:54] <+sundizzle> also you'll want the advanced mikiri coutner
[4:19:58] <%Solidnick18> pick the really good one for now and then get the rest later
[4:20:00] <resloxxx> For the secret arts you need to master the basic ones
[4:20:02] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie Versus Basic Skill Trees
[4:20:06] <austincoool> WOOLIE would you ever play KOTOR2 ?
[4:20:08] <Legendary2bASS> Mikiri counter is THE BEST one out there
[4:20:12] <Nyckelus> Suppress presence and Mikiri upgrade is god-like anyway. I’m surprised you haven’t gotten them earlier.
[4:20:13] <Graxe_> Every skill tree is like this. These are more generally themed, but they are skill trees.
[4:20:14] <shevan123> when was the last time you played this woolie?
[4:20:19] <RoboXGP> no more shit games for woolie, pat plays those!!
[4:20:20] <+zanzibar_junker> also unlocks better mikiri counter
[4:20:40] <+velocitasfortis> Everything on the Shinobi tree is great, except for those spirit emblem ones. Those can go suck a cucumber.
[4:20:42] <Jigokuro> Midnight-thirty?
[4:20:53] <NaturalGear> yeah it was really good
[4:21:03] <Legendary2bASS> yeah, the spirit emblems upgrade is very point wasting TBH
[4:21:07] <+MagicBeanBurrito> yeyeye
[4:21:14] <Legendary2bASS> you get +2 FFS
[4:21:18] <Legendary2bASS> you start at 20
[4:21:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> It is the ONLY way to play the song
[4:21:19] <%Straylightgg> Straylightgg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! hey woolz, glad to finally catch a stream. I appreciate you and I'm proud of you
[4:21:22] <alexandrecau> you want to shout it loud
[4:21:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Its like I carry the weight of the world
[4:21:37] <%QueequegTheater> Minh confirmed shit taste
[4:21:41] <alexandrecau> Minh the frugal as always
[4:21:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> but the truth is that I'm only one girl
[4:21:55] <+zanzibar_junker> you kill god
[4:21:59] <+velocitasfortis> just a girl in the world
[4:22:00] <+Gamefriendly> wait what is he talking about?
[4:22:06] <+velocitasfortis> that's all that you'll let me beeeeee
[4:22:11] <Legendary2bASS> Did he actually play nier automatic tomatoes yet?
[4:22:16] <%QueequegTheater> @Gamefriendly Nier:Automata final credits song
[4:22:20] <NaturalGear> @Gamefriendly Nier Automata song
[4:22:20] <+velocitasfortis> Mostly
[4:22:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Legendary2bASS yes
[4:22:22] <+thackattack00> he has a whole LP dude
[4:22:25] <%QueequegTheater> @Legendary2bASS He did a full LP
[4:22:30] <+Gamefriendly> @QueequegTheater oh alright, thanks
[4:22:37] <Akett> The multi-language version adds more weight to "even if my words seem meaningless"
[4:22:37] <Legendary2bASS> Minh, I mean. Sorry
[4:22:45] <SirDogBear> woolie can farm xp now PogChamp
[4:22:54] <henshin2289> stealth
[4:22:55] <+velocitasfortis> Yeah, and then the company chorus starts up...
[4:23:03] <%Nomad_Scholar> ah HA
[4:23:06] <Nyckelus> Welcome to farmtown number 2!
[4:23:08] <+velocitasfortis> kdubCry
[4:23:08] <resloxxx> Better
[4:23:09] <%Nomad_Scholar> Fromsoft laughing
[4:23:11] <%QueequegTheater> It's the same
[4:23:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> and you get to kill Square Enix
[4:23:12] <UnfilteredComic> Better
[4:23:16] <alexandrecau> When woolie emotions are chemicals ask you to focus on beauty you're a robot
[4:23:26] <Legendary2bASS> Farm town? Not really. More like FARM guy!
[4:23:26] <resloxxx> Better since it grants resistance
[4:23:31] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Purple Gourd = Lean
[4:23:38] <usurper_sos> Purple drank
[4:23:43] <+velocitasfortis> Killing Squeenix was the true goal of NieR: Automatron
[4:23:48] <Legendary2bASS> that one guy gives you twice the amount of half of the people there
[4:23:49] <Legendary2bASS> lmao
[4:23:54] <+velocitasfortis> sizzurp
[4:23:55] <@Menitta> the best part about hearing a song multiple times is listening to all of the instrumental levels mixing together
[4:23:58] <Legendary2bASS> with less time even
[4:23:59] <SirDogBear> woolie will always have a purple and green gourd in his inventory for style
[4:24:22] <Graxe_> Adamantium exists in Japan
[4:24:26] <Legendary2bASS> just two, woolz
[4:24:37] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie is so addicted to the borderline useless situational consumable LUL
[4:24:44] <Legendary2bASS> LUL
[4:24:54] <+velocitasfortis> *snickt* Bub
[4:24:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:24:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Just give the Merchant your Credit Card
[4:25:16] <Legendary2bASS> LUL LUL
[4:25:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> no debt in THIS fiction
[4:25:36] <usurper_sos> No shinobi student loans to pay
[4:25:38] <+velocitasfortis> Except until the end of a particular NPCs questline...
[4:25:39] <Legendary2bASS> MIND GOBLINS
[4:25:41] <MONSTR_UwU> hoarder wools LUL
[4:25:45] <Legendary2bASS> YEYEYE
[4:25:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Oh NO!! Loan sidequests
[4:25:56] <castcola> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[4:26:00] <%DedlokPM> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[4:26:00] <Legendary2bASS> More like Elixers woolz
[4:26:01] <resloxxx> Sell the sugar since you aren't using them and killing Headless grants you the unlimited version
[4:26:07] <+cvp5127> horde it got it
[4:26:08] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie has the exact opposite
[4:26:11] <Legendary2bASS> Never hoarded Ethers
[4:26:20] <seylumiue> Horde ot like a dragon, sure
[4:26:24] <xeros720> some people will do that on ethers, but yeah, mostly elixirs
[4:26:26] <+velocitasfortis> *end credits playing* BUT WHAT IF I NEED IT THO?!
[4:26:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> The more debt you acrue the more fights on the overworld and Bounty Hunter fights
[4:26:41] <xeros720> the worst part is, i'll freaking forget to use them by that point
[4:26:41] <Legendary2bASS> Elixers and Megalixers are hoarded and not used
[4:26:57] <SirDogBear> to be fair in this game if you do beat a boss your attack power goes up so it could be worth it if you really close to beating one but have no more resources
[4:26:58] <%Nomad_Scholar> Old Witch's Ring to save someone in DS1
[4:27:01] <Legendary2bASS> Elixers are for Displays and bragging rights only
[4:27:06] <MONSTR_UwU> *credits end* BUT WAHT IF SECRET BOSS
[4:27:10] <+velocitasfortis> I use them when I'm at full health, just so I'm not tempted to use them when I need them
[4:27:12] <seylumiue> Here come the boys
[4:27:22] <xeros720> you ever see people that have to collect 99x of everything?
[4:27:22] <+velocitasfortis> ONE OF USSSSS
[4:27:27] <Legendary2bASS> BAG MAN BAG MAN HYPE FOR BAG MAN
[4:27:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I use Elixers and Full Party Heals at this point to troll my friends
[4:27:31] <+velocitasfortis> *raises hand*
[4:27:50] <Kghaleon> Oh snap, Woolie's playing Sekiro. Hope I got here in time.
[4:27:58] <+velocitasfortis> Literally bought every coin purse in the game, and never used one, ever.
[4:27:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> !uptime
[4:27:59] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 39 minutes
[4:28:18] <%hazzy_o7> ez xp
[4:28:23] <Legendary2bASS> man, this was the bloodborniest stage there
[4:28:25] <+MagicBeanBurrito> a real farm
[4:28:25] <presque> @kghaleon you're way late
[4:28:32] <Djinnazz> XP is shit here though
[4:28:33] <+velocitasfortis> literal farm
[4:28:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Unfortunately they aren't worth that much.
[4:28:36] <Kghaleon> @presque nah man
[4:28:44] <+w4rhe4rt_> Those Lovecraft fish ppl
[4:28:44] <Legendary2bASS> no woolz XP is shit there
[4:28:44] <+duskrush> Oh boy, here I go klling again
[4:28:46] <+velocitasfortis> But they die so fast and respawn so quickly
[4:28:47] <Legendary2bASS> nooo
[4:29:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> All these guys are White Mooses in Nier A
[4:29:12] <Mendin> Oh Woolie made it to Little Yharnamtown
[4:29:13] <Kghaleon> This is the most Bloodborne area.
[4:29:13] <+conqab> or court
[4:29:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Look at all these Pats.
[4:29:34] <%Nomad_Scholar> oh, look at that
[4:29:36] <Legendary2bASS> there is literally one guy there that gives TWICE the amount of these whole chump
[4:29:38] <seylumiue> Smh Woolie still using ichimonji for damage
[4:29:46] <+velocitasfortis> I think Hirata is better for money, but this is simpler
[4:29:57] <%Nomad_Scholar> woolie needing to heal after dealing a finishing blow
[4:29:58] <Legendary2bASS> ichimonji double is for bosses
[4:30:12] <NaturalGear> this is good for skill points
[4:30:14] <+duskrush> Oh the irony
[4:30:17] <resloxxx> I would farm in hirata also for the divine confetti
[4:30:19] <Legendary2bASS> if you wanna "farm" use the spinslash woolz
[4:31:18] <%hazzy_o7> Isn't Ashina castle the best place to farm confetti?
[4:31:48] <thewizardchan> Wouldn't be if you had that skill Kappa
[4:32:04] <+duskrush> Hindsight's 20/20
[4:32:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:32:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> If you could see your full stats and "life bar" in real life would you take it?
[4:32:24] <Djinnazz> hell yeah
[4:32:29] <Legendary2bASS> hell no! I want that suprise when I reach 50
[4:32:35] <%QueequegTheater> fuck no
[4:32:35] <Legendary2bASS> LUL
[4:32:49] <Legendary2bASS> I don't want to see my Debufss
[4:32:54] <%QueequegTheater> I don't need to know how low my strength is
[4:33:11] <usurper_sos> It's a genocidal rampage at this point
[4:33:23] <Kghaleon> Having a lifebar would be insane anxiety.
[4:33:32] <Graxe_> Raid the hosues
[4:33:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> but what if EVERYBODY could see everyones stats in real life?
[4:33:36] <Djinnazz> "Wwhat the fuck is this 'slow poison in my colon...oh god..."
[4:34:00] <+Koover> has woolie finished the castle yet?
[4:34:00] <DianaTheAscian> OH NO
[4:34:08] <Legendary2bASS> "I'm Bleeding" WHERE???
[4:34:12] <Kghaleon> Status effect: Cancer "oh no"
[4:34:15] <Legendary2bASS> fuck no
[4:34:16] <+duskrush> He's chosen greed
[4:34:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> imagine seeing the progress bars before you get sick
[4:34:43] <seylumiue> @koover he did yeah
[4:34:47] <+duskrush> tbh it'd be incredibly useful if you saw the disease pop up the moment it happened
[4:34:48] <Legendary2bASS> I will settle with a "Build-up meter" I guess
[4:34:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> a sliding bar that reads PREGNANT
[4:35:05] <+Koover> dang, i'll have to check the VODs
[4:35:13] <Legendary2bASS> but the sheer amount of Build up meter is gonna be shit LUL
[4:35:29] <+duskrush> A slow building meter that says 'diabetes'
[4:35:31] <Djinnazz> Imagine seeing a unblock-able sign show up out of nowhere. "Shit! is it a stab or a sweep!"
[4:35:37] <+velocitasfortis> You see a status bar building up one tick per day, and when it procs you die of old age.
[4:35:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @duskrush Slow?
[4:35:43] <%GabeSweetMan> GabeSweetMan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Glad to see the reception the Wonderful 101 LP is receiving despite the criminally low view count. We're finally at the part of the game where the escalation really does start to feel like playing Gurren Lagaan arc finales back to back to back.
[4:35:50] <+Koover> the healing one is great
[4:35:55] <+Koover> it stacks
[4:36:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Healing stacks!
[4:36:10] <Legendary2bASS> You casually walking and you hear "DING" where the fuck is that unblockable coming from?!
[4:36:10] <+duskrush> @Breakfast_Megapowers you wouldn't just gain it. It'd build up like the terror or curse meter
[4:36:19] <+velocitasfortis> *bussed*
[4:36:22] <+Koover> I got that ability first
[4:36:28] <seylumiue> Full heal get outta here
[4:36:30] <EyeFarted> Like the Ring of the Evil Eye
[4:36:34] <+duskrush> And then when you get old: !Bones at Risk!
[4:36:44] <ArthurDoyleRPG> He thought it would be a full heal LUL LUL LUL
[4:36:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Idk man I've been eating Pepsicles since I was 3 years old
[4:37:09] <%GabeSweetMan> I do miss having an equivalent "! BLANK AT RISK !" message for Sekiro.
[4:37:19] <Legendary2bASS> Mango Popsicle is the best though
[4:37:22] <+Koover> has he tried out the mist raven feather?
[4:37:28] <%GabeSweetMan> Unseen aid feels the most pointless.
[4:37:28] <+velocitasfortis> Headless disappears, then !BUTTHOLE AT RISK!
[4:37:29] <resloxxx> Dragonrot will not allow you to continue Side Quests
[4:37:41] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL @velocitasfortis
[4:37:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> but Popsicle made of Pepsi. Pepsicle
[4:37:54] <Professor_Rakor> The whole point of healing people: If they have a quest you can't progress it while they are sick.
[4:37:55] <Legendary2bASS> MAAAAN, Dragon rot was so disappointing one you don't care about the people who get them
[4:37:59] <Tucker0603> can't continue side quests though
[4:38:07] <%callowheart> MizBazz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! gannbatte homie
[4:38:14] <Kghaleon> I'm glad I'm not an NPC in one of Woolie's games.
[4:38:23] <Snookasaurus> i never even got the gourd, didnt need it
[4:38:31] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Thanks to Pat, Woolie doesn't care about NPCs anymore LUL
[4:38:35] <Legendary2bASS> be glad that you aren't in PAT's NPC
[4:38:47] <+duskrush> When antivaxxers see a syringe the ublockable symbol appears and the mikiri counter it
[4:38:53] <usurper_sos> I feel like the mind goblins are coming out
[4:38:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> we are all NPC's in Pats life
[4:38:58] <+Koover> oh he never talked to black hat
[4:39:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> think about that
[4:39:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:39:09] <Legendary2bASS> yeah.. the whole dragon rot experience was ruined with pat. Even the MK11 story got shit on.
[4:39:21] <cstigerwright> Does Reboot hold up all these years later
[4:39:27] <Legendary2bASS> was one of the better story line tbh
[4:39:44] <TrashLeviathan> @Legendary2bASS it was okay
[4:39:51] <+thesw1tch> !motivated
[4:39:51] <@Moobot> 353 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:39:51] <+velocitasfortis> I healed dragonrot after every boss fight, and still ended up swimming in blood droplets
[4:39:55] <tattleworm> "i'll slaughter this village to warm up" is a hero line
[4:39:55] <%GabeSweetMan> @cstigerwright The animation: Nah. The story: Yah.
[4:39:55] <RoboXGP> pat shits on anything that is physically there to be shit on
[4:39:58] <%stemlo_> How long have we been running?
[4:40:05] <+duskrush> All our lives
[4:40:06] <+Sabre_Basilisk> !schedule
[4:40:06] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:40:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> But the Village also has Dr.Salvadore and BINGO
[4:40:18] <ArthurDoyleRPG> MK 11 was ruined the moment they said time travel doodScrub
[4:40:19] <%ledshamans> ledshamans subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak!
[4:40:21] <GyroBrando> A lot of other places drop a lot more gold
[4:40:23] <$Louie_Salmon> Hey chat, watching the VOD right now. No one in chat is mentioning it, but Woolie is randomly crouching during tough fights. Am I the only one noticing that?
[4:40:25] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Again
[4:40:33] <Legendary2bASS> Instead of try to be better and not try to die due to the Dragonrot.. He just goes back to facefucking a challenge
[4:40:35] <+duskrush> cue You Say Run
[4:40:39] <Nyckelus> Because endgame has a better route with more exp and gold.
[4:40:48] <+velocitasfortis> Hirata drops decent gold, and drops tons of Wealth Balloons as well. Hirata for gold farming, Mibu for XP
[4:40:50] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Mysterious
[4:40:57] <%GabeSweetMan> @Louie_Salmon That would be because he's crapping himself in fear presumably.
[4:41:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Nyckelus How much can you farm from that movie?
[4:41:04] <+thackattack00> @Louie_Salmon He's mixing up sprint and crouch
[4:41:06] <+duskrush> @Nyckelus I thought you were talking about the movie for a second
[4:41:10] <Nyckelus> @louie_salmon Woolie addresses it later on.
[4:41:14] <Legendary2bASS> the villagers drop 34 exp and a couple of coins even with the BUFF
[4:41:15] <Professor_Rakor> 4 drinks
[4:41:22] <Legendary2bASS> super waste
[4:41:31] <+Koover> I think theres enough to give everyone a drink
[4:41:38] <Nyckelus> @breakfast_megapowers Everything.
[4:41:43] <Legendary2bASS> Drink for LORE
[4:41:50] <+velocitasfortis> 11sen per kill in Mibu, 34sen in Hirata, per kill.
[4:41:51] <Legendary2bASS> give to EMMA WAIFU
[4:41:53] <Professor_Rakor> ashina, monkey, unrefined, dragonspring
[4:42:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Drink is purely for lore but it's always worthwhile.
[4:42:09] <$Louie_Salmon> Okay, cool. I assume it's just a stress thing where he wants to move so much that he's pushing the stick hard, like mashing in fighting games
[4:42:10] <%GabeSweetMan> UHHH? How on earth did they get agro'd lol
[4:42:26] <+thackattack00> happens when you break the physics objects up there
[4:42:34] <RoboXGP> if you stereo type people you can figure out what drink they want
[4:42:48] <+velocitasfortis> @Louie_Salmon I think he said that's exactly what happens - accidental clicks. I have the same problem. BIG MAN HANDS
[4:42:49] <Nyckelus> It’s the same drink.
[4:43:08] <NaturalGear> it's 4 times each
[4:43:09] <Legendary2bASS> Aight boys! I'm out! @WoolieVersus Happy stream buddy! Do the Parry dance more!
[4:43:15] <%Aussie_Manny> Is Ghosts of Sushi gonna be PS4 exclusive?
[4:43:18] <%Aussie_Manny> kkenHMM
[4:43:21] <+velocitasfortis> Everybody who can drink, will take one of each type of sake
[4:43:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Sekiro REALLY needs to splurge on some Crystal Head or something
[4:43:28] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Sekiro: Drinkers drink twice
[4:43:31] <RoboXGP> this fucking moon shine
[4:43:39] <+krispen_wa> she's fucking chugging it
[4:43:45] <+velocitasfortis> GO GO GO GO!
[4:43:56] <+krispen_wa> SHE STUDIED THE BLADE
[4:43:56] <%Aussie_Manny> CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG
[4:43:57] <%GabeSweetMan> There's Unrefined, Ashina, Monkey, but what's the last one?
[4:44:00] <Professor_Rakor> Dragonspring, unrefined, ashina, and monkey booze
[4:44:02] <+velocitasfortis> **foreshadowing**
[4:44:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Ah Dragonspring, thanks @Professor_Rakor
[4:44:30] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Intriguing coxBut
[4:44:37] <+Ecchigun> hi woolie
[4:44:40] <+Estuko> she studied the Ara ara while you played with the blade
[4:44:43] <$Louie_Salmon> @velocitasfortis Weird. Makes sense though I guess. But I wonder how much of that is big hands and how much of that is genre unfamiliarity, because I can't short hop in smash at all but I don't have this stick problem
[4:44:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> That Booze solves everything
[4:44:45] <alexandrecau> how creepy is it someone give you sake and just watches you chugging
[4:44:51] <+Ecchigun> hello mods that i know
[4:45:07] <alexandrecau> and then asks question
[4:45:11] <+Koover> @WoolieVersus theres a new prosthetic you can go get if you teleport to the bottom of the castle bonfire
[4:45:14] <+NiktenKing> @Estuko So basically Orihime from Bleach... gotcha
[4:45:16] <+kujofire990> man....toonami this week is great episodes....UI Goke, All41 vs 14ALL, and part one of Bites the Dust for JoJo
[4:45:19] <KoyFoster> He see's that she carries herself like a swordmen.
[4:45:20] <+Ecchigun> wow i just joined
[4:45:21] <Professor_Rakor> I think he sees callouses on the hands or something?

[4:46:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Im going to rebinge the W101 playthrough when I get my day off tomorrow
[4:46:02] <%Nomad_Scholar> I would assume a shinobi looks for signs of a weapon on anyone if their job is protecting someone

[4:48:09] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:48:15] <seylumiue> Slap bayo 1 and 2 on the end to hit 101
[4:48:26] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Ever tried Infinite Space? It's basically Legend of the Galactic Heroes by platinum and the Clocktower/Nightcry guy
