[0:10:16] <@Solidus_113> Taiga is in Dengeki Bunko, not this
[0:10:28] <%NWannabe> @frenchpooper id like that, but it'd be western dev'd and....let's be real
[0:10:30] <GeltonZ> Oh you mean the guy who LIES ABOUT SNK HEROINES?
[0:10:32] <KalmVibrations> The whole elemental system is kinda weird

[0:11:42] <@Menitta> Just play Iori and you'll figure it out Kappa
[0:11:43] <+Flutts_> lolis are illegal in Canada Woolie
[0:11:43] <redrins> we gacha
[0:11:49] <$StaceMcGate> are these underage girls about to be lewded? I fear for their safety
[0:11:49] <SuperFightinRobot> No, we have not reached Arcana Heart levels yet. Yet.
[0:11:50] <%NWannabe> Japan...why gotta be dis way
[0:11:54] <shadowmaksim> Damn, that didn't take long. Seeing the FBI/jail jokes already.
[0:11:54] <%tearfuldevil> im big into studying mythology
[0:11:57] <+Jaysky> Loli's are very legal and VERY cool.
[0:12:01] <%tearfuldevil> and anime doing arthurian mythos has
[0:12:03] <rubbishbinge> Kai-ri-sei Million Arthur was a mistake
[0:12:04] <SpawnConnery> Iori is a loli
[0:12:10] <GeltonZ> @SuperFightinRobot This is made by the Arcana Heart devs. And is much lewder.
[0:12:12] <%tearfuldevil> um
[0:12:14] <%NWannabe> is hardline making faces\
[0:12:19] <+Flutts_> lewder!?
[0:12:19] <%tearfuldevil> scarred my horribly

[0:12:46] <%NWannabe> aight, im bout to head out for legend of legaia
[0:12:46] <Korgororo> better to get the jokes out of the way before some of these character's turn out to be cool NotLikeThis LUL
[0:12:50] <%tearfuldevil> @GeltonZ oh fuck off japan
[0:12:52] <fuji_92> damn, card games and fighting games, who da thought Kappa
[0:12:53] <mMayrro> ok but when's Iori? Kappa
[0:12:56] <GeltonZ> @SuperKirby24 There's this catgirl in here...she's gonna be shaking her booty a lot if I get a match.
[0:13:12] <%jetjagger222> @tearknack its mostly for otaku-centric stuff
[0:13:13] <rubbishbinge> Damn these are all cards that were actually in the gacha game
[0:13:15] <+Flutts_> is that a cute witch!?
[0:13:16] <Korgororo> or so I hope pvpS
[0:13:20] <JacktheMan18> Elements do matter btw
[0:13:26] <GeltonZ> @SuperKirby24 Oh wait wolf girl, my bad.
[0:13:36] <gordieda20> ELEMENTS
[0:13:38] <GeltonZ> @jediwatchman11 Yes. A witch on a vacuum.
[0:13:50] <+Flutts_> sold
[0:13:51] <%NWannabe> @GeltonZ that girl from HxH?
[0:13:58] <$CaityCoopScoops> Cheer500 fight geam :))
[0:14:02] <GeltonZ> @NWannabe I don't think so?
[0:14:07] <Hammatime8> These designs... hopefully tonight's "Get Onto Fighting Games" doesn't turn into "Get Into a Federal Watch List"
[0:14:09] <%tearfuldevil> @jetjagger222 not sure what you're saying? i mena yeha, course its otaku pandering if its loli shit
[0:14:10] <CasualAlohaFriday> Shizuku
[0:14:14] <%NWannabe> I know, just vacuum warriors are rare af
[0:14:28] <%jetjagger222> @tearknack that's exactly what i'm saying. akiba is full of it
[0:14:32] <%NWannabe> why do otaku need lolis though? haven't we grown up?
[0:14:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Hammatime8 With that comment from Reggie earlier, it's already too late
[0:14:41] <JacktheMan18> @WoolieVersus That's part of another mechanic
[0:14:48] <KalmVibrations> Certain characters are associated with certain elements
[0:14:49] <%jetjagger222> @NWannabe because grown women are intimidating
[0:14:59] <+Flutts_> and the purity thing is *huge* for otaku
[0:15:02] <Hammatime8> Okay, I'm running out of jokes about the legallity of the anime children
[0:15:03] <%NWannabe> @jetjagger222 but thats the FUN part
[0:15:08] <%tearfuldevil> @NWannabe because "they're fictional so its fine" and ebcause japan is really fucked
[0:15:13] <Korgororo> imagine liking lolis when Ara Ara exists pvpSK
[0:15:15] <%jetjagger222> @jediwatchman11 bingo, same thing with idol shit. its fucked
[0:15:23] <GeltonZ> It's also because Japan loves cute things.
[0:15:34] <fuji_92> jokenpo PogChamp
[0:15:39] <%tearfuldevil> i mena i love cute things
[0:15:44] <@Menitta> I wish I didn't just play as Iori when I touched this game at Mag
[0:15:45] <%NWannabe> @tearknack I just wish...time moved for more than just the fans
[0:15:46] <ikantreeed> ...doesn't makes sense but ok
[0:15:47] <%tearfuldevil> i don't wanna fucke em
[0:15:59] <%NWannabe> you can be adult and cute tho
[0:16:03] <JacktheMan18> Yeah that's th mechanic
[0:16:15] <JacktheMan18> It's A+B+C @WoolieVersus
[0:16:17] <%tearfuldevil> fair
[0:16:21] <Saltmeisterr> Ok nut why is iori here tho?
[0:16:24] <nobody12349> Imagine liking lolis when tomboys exist woolieSMUG
[0:16:25] <+Flutts_> I don't know about you guys but I sure do love reading text walls before playing a fighting game
[0:16:27] <Saltmeisterr> but*
[0:16:32] <%NWannabe> it makes sense from a purity standpoint...which is hypocritical af and why it annoys me so
[0:16:37] <CasualAlohaFriday> The word for for 'attractive' in Japan is the same as the word for 'cute'
[0:16:41] <dellis80> The solution to this problem is Naramaya, lol
[0:16:41] <%jetjagger222> @jediwatchman11 i also love it in my FPS. hello doom eternal
[0:16:53] <%NWannabe> @jediwatchman11 I played GGXRD story mode too
[0:16:57] <%tearfuldevil> sam gamgee is cute
[0:17:07] <shadowmaksim> @Saltmeisterr It was a collab thing. Thief Arthur was in "SNK Heronies" and this game got Iori in exchange..
[0:17:13] <%NWannabe> kirei == pretty, kawaii == cute ???
[0:17:23] <%NWannabe> then again, kirei is for objects?
[0:17:24] <Saltmeisterr> oh weird
[0:17:25] <CasualAlohaFriday> I don't think Kirei applies to people, though?
[0:17:31] <+Jaysky> Why isn't Iori in every game?
[0:17:41] <%tearfuldevil> Iori Everywhere System
[0:17:44] <fuji_92> ^
[0:17:45] <CasualAlohaFriday> I've seen it used almost always for inanimate objects
[0:17:47] <%NWannabe> @CasualAlohaFriday then again, as much as women get objectified....
[0:17:48] <%SirGO0SE> #pitcrew #ferry
[0:17:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oho, beat me to it
[0:17:56] <fangovafang> like nitro blasterz
[0:18:00] <%tearfuldevil> i hope that iori isekai light novel gets an anime
[0:18:06] <+Flutts_> @SirGO0SE I feel this
[0:18:09] <%jetjagger222> @NWannabe not to worry, there's equal amounts of fujoshi bait stuff
[0:18:09] <@Solidus_113> cheevos
[0:18:20] <NevikGamina> like Mentlegens
[0:18:24] <CasualAlohaFriday> Ferry is so many fetishes at once
[0:18:25] <%NWannabe> i know i know, but i am neighbors with this house
[0:18:26] <JacktheMan18> Basically Lvl 1 assists can only be canceled by normals, lvl 2 assists can be canceled from normal and specials, and lvl 3 assists can be canceled from everything including supers @WoolieVersus
[0:18:29] <+mr_miyagucci> if iori was in an anime i would watch that in a second
[0:18:32] <+SuperKirby24> characters fighting with their cards, so its pretty much future card buddyfight Kappa
[0:18:36] <+mr_miyagucci> i would be watching that right now
[0:18:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:18:37] <%jetjagger222> @mr_miyagichu there is a KOF anime
[0:18:43] <%tearfuldevil> yeah dude/dude stuff in manga is fucked
[0:18:45] <%SirGO0SE> doodBro @jediwatchman11
[0:18:47] <Hammatime8> ngl, the most interesting part of the stream right now is the folks in chat saying "japan wtf"
[0:18:53] <%NWannabe> Meanwhile, Kyo like 'i am totally a main char'
[0:19:00] <rubbishbinge> Luckily Ferry is over 100 years old, so it's fine

[0:19:21] <Ultimatefool> wtf SUDDENLY IORI
[0:19:29] <CasualAlohaFriday> Ferry is the ghost of a 13-year old bunnygirl. She's pedo, necro, besti, and armpit fetish all at once

[0:21:05] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:21:06] <%NWannabe> haha
[0:21:07] <CasualAlohaFriday> CENSORED!!!
[0:21:07] <Korgororo> feet are enough Reggie - don't awaken to the darkness
[0:21:08] <+PR0swagonist> they took out the line in english
[0:21:09] <peachy996> no dick
[0:21:11] <+MegaMillenniumX> oh my god NotLikeThis
[0:21:11] <JacktheMan18> It's censored on PC
[0:21:12] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you have to patch the dick move back in
[0:21:13] <+Jaysky> Oh she's from that Trials of Mana game
[0:21:14] <+jiggy_snipe> no they removed it
[0:21:15] <KalmVibrations> Also yeah, the Steam version censored it
[0:21:17] <+Jaysky> Right?
[0:21:18] <CasualAlohaFriday> NOT Nice Chinchin!
[0:21:21] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus It's because she doesn't have a dick and it's censored on PC. Gotta get the uncensor patch.
[0:21:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wait, isn't that the lady from Trials of Mana 3?
[0:21:24] <peachy996> Oh they did? Cowards
[0:21:29] <%jetjagger222> @Valentinius_Anodyne ues
[0:21:29] <GeltonZ> @Valentinius_Anodyne Yup
[0:21:30] <shadowmaksim> @WoolieVersus Dick grab is only on male characters. Also, English version of the game had it removed, so it's censored.
[0:21:35] <peachy996> Embarassed Cowards
[0:21:36] <%NWannabe> O rly, I'm always conflicted on common sense censorship
[0:21:37] <%Wool> NICE CHINCHIN
[0:21:42] <JacktheMan18> Yeah and one of the assists is the theif from Trials of Mana
[0:21:42] <+TopTieramisu> NICE CHINCHIN
[0:21:51] <%NWannabe> how is he alive?
[0:21:56] <+mr_miyagucci> @WoolieVersus there are airdashes in this game including for Iori
[0:22:04] <%tearfuldevil> yeah, googling it, riesz is from trials of mana
[0:22:10] <%jetjagger222> is that second assist anime gozer
[0:22:10] <CasualAlohaFriday> It had to be censored on the PS4, and the devs were too lazy to put it back in for the Steam version, I guess
[0:22:11] <%NWannabe> Iori is this generation's Jotaro.
[0:22:15] <Solidnick18> crossover thing
[0:22:16] <%jetjagger222> also BGM is fire
[0:22:18] <JacktheMan18> Iori got Isekai'd LUL
[0:22:19] <%Wool> NICE CHINCHIN
[0:22:21] <+StooEsq> A portal?
[0:22:22] <GeltonZ> SNK wants to have a guest character in every fighter. Think about it.
[0:22:25] <%tearfuldevil> i think all the "otherworldly" characters are guests, maybe?
[0:22:34] <GeltonZ> @tearknack CORRECT!
[0:22:42] <+Roivas1991> Guests from crossover events?
[0:22:45] <%NWannabe> @GeltonZ explain terry in smash, then LUL
[0:22:56] <GeltonZ> @NWannabe That's exactly what I said!
[0:22:58] <+Flutts_> speaking of Trials of Mana, Charlotte is the worst RPG party member ever. An entire character dedicated to UWU speak
[0:23:02] <+Sulfur_Boride> Iori's got his own Isekai novel now
[0:23:09] <shadowmaksim> @WoolieVersus To explain, Iori is here due to a collab. "SNK Heroines" got Thief Arthur as a guest DLC character so, in exchange, this game got Iori.
[0:23:11] <+vaporousTippler> Charlotte was always the worst.
[0:23:13] <+Roivas1991> SNK seems to be used for mostly crossovers now.
[0:23:14] <%NWannabe> ha
[0:23:17] <%jetjagger222> @jediwatchman11 that sounds nuts
[0:23:24] <%NWannabe> SNK Charlotte is great, tho
[0:23:26] <+Flutts_> Chawette
[0:23:34] <GeltonZ> @jediwatchman11 It's so sad. I have friends who were fans of her before the official translation. They hate her now.
[0:23:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @jediwatchman11 She wasn't so bad in the fan translation, I believe
[0:23:38] <%tearfuldevil> the actual game here seems pretty neat
[0:23:41] <+SuperKirby24> those assist meters fill so fast Kappa
[0:23:48] <Solidnick18> Yeah the crossover with snk heroines Kappa
[0:24:04] <JacktheMan18> The UWU speak was just a poor localization choice imo
[0:24:05] <%NWannabe> i need an epilepsy warning
[0:24:05] <%tearfuldevil> the designs of some of the assists are just....yeah
[0:24:08] <GeltonZ> BTW Level 3 supers all cause anime cutscenes.
[0:24:12] <%jetjagger222> guys this is the last time we'll see iori in sprite form in a while
[0:24:17] <BestTeaMaker> oh, that's the girl from Hi Score girl
[0:24:19] <BestTeaMaker> that's cool
[0:24:23] <%NWannabe> rail change?
[0:24:30] <%Sparkseid> Hopefully we see some level 3s
[0:24:35] <+Flutts_> 0/10
[0:24:37] <+GenesisKnight> What is this trash?!
[0:24:40] <Ner234> -1/10
[0:24:43] <+vaporousTippler> Yeah, but at least the shirt moved for the whole animation.
[0:24:44] <+TopTieramisu> the final stage of laughter is DLC :)
[0:24:46] <@Menitta> This Iori sprite is so weird
[0:24:47] <fuji_92> -10/10
[0:24:51] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the purple assist girl is from high score girl, that big fg manga
[0:24:52] <%NWannabe> Please tell me your select?
[0:24:52] <+GenesisKnight> -100/10
[0:24:52] <fangovafang> 🤦🏽♂️
[0:24:54] <+Flutts_> laugh cancel
[0:24:55] <+StooEsq> time to shut this game off, disgusting
[0:24:56] <%jetjagger222> @Menitta its extra anime
[0:25:04] <TheBensonator_> I... just... wut
[0:25:04] <%NWannabe> wait, why we rematching with a whole cast?
[0:25:14] <+Jaysky> Does Iori lose all his power if his leg-belt is severed?
[0:25:16] <+TopTieramisu> NICE CHINCHIN
[0:25:21] <fuji_92> yo we got laugh cancels? PogChamp
[0:25:28] <shotodan> gn guys
[0:25:34] <%NWannabe> is that like cough cancels?
[0:25:36] <@Menitta> I remember on Saltybet, there's an Iori that goes into a super loud scout laugh
[0:25:45] <T_Sasquatch> Is it me or are her panties visible from behind ....
[0:25:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20

[0:25:59] <+Rivalsz> dang reggie had some combos
[0:26:02] <@Menitta> Many Ioris
[0:26:03] <%tearfuldevil> @T_Sasquatch imma say probably not
[0:26:11] <%NWannabe> Yo, arcade girl is ok
[0:26:14] <+SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:26:15] <+jiggy_snipe> arcade cabinet too strong
[0:26:19] <+Rivalsz> ono azusa baby
[0:26:19] <+TopTieramisu> everybody loves iori. even though kyo's moves are cooler :)
[0:26:23] <%Sparkseid> highschool girl is OD
[0:26:27] <%NWannabe> BODEGA!
[0:26:32] <BestTeaMaker> hi score girl is great
[0:26:33] <+Rivalsz> highscore girl*
[0:26:33] <+MegaMillenniumX> we saltybet now
[0:26:38] <@Menitta> Whoever created Iori must be some kind of genius
[0:26:42] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus that purple girl is from Highscore Girl, so that might literally be a third strike cabinet
[0:26:49] <%NWannabe> btw, thanks to @WoolieVersus I have psycho ball on my phone now
[0:26:55] <+TopTieramisu> didn''t the creator of kenshin design iori?
[0:27:02] <%tearfuldevil> ....
[0:27:04] <+Rivalsz> they never got to third strike on the series
[0:27:06] <%tearfuldevil> oof if true
[0:27:11] <+Jaysky> Oh shit no wonder she looked familiar tearknack
[0:27:11] <%jetjagger222> don't think so
[0:27:14] <+Rivalsz> its most like SF2
[0:27:22] <%tearfuldevil> ah
[0:27:29] <fuji_92> Iori has too strong of a style for ppl to not like him
[0:27:30] <%NWannabe> reggie, notice the air dash
[0:27:31] <%tearfuldevil> i haven't actually watched/read high score girl
[0:27:41] <+FrenchTact1cs> Iori with Air dash? Whats this?
[0:27:45] <%jetjagger222> IIRC watsuki only worked on the newcomers in samsho V
[0:27:47] <+Jaysky> I'll admit, I wanted Iori in Smash over O-KAY
[0:27:52] <+Roivas1991> I think I know why Iori is in this...because the main character is in SNK Heroines.
[0:27:58] <ShutenDragoon> @WoolieVersus Iori does have the full laugh animation its just another victory animation he has
[0:27:59] <JacktheMan18> Iori's air dash is messed up
[0:28:02] <NevikGamina> LUL
[0:28:02] <+Rivalsz> highsciore girl had to be rebranded because capcom.
[0:28:04] <+Flutts_> oh my god it is Asuka

[0:32:07] <%tearfuldevil> wtf do these people have to do with king arthur
[0:32:11] <CasualAlohaFriday> @TheVoltStrike Arthur is always female in Japan
[0:32:13] <%NWannabe> Reggie......do combo
[0:32:21] <CasualAlohaFriday> Except in Makai Mura
[0:32:23] <%NWannabe> @CasualAlohaFriday why is that?
[0:32:27] <+TopTieramisu> japan loves gender bending historical figures
[0:32:31] <+TopTieramisu> even oda nobunaga
[0:32:32] <fuji_92> touch him Reggie
[0:32:32] <KalmVibrations> They're all King Arthurs from different worlds
[0:32:33] <CasualAlohaFriday> Because lul Japan
[0:32:34] <TheVoltStrike> true, where's seibah
[0:32:40] <GeltonZ> @tearknack They all pulled out Excalibur. A million of them did. Now they have to fight to figure out who is the TRUE King Arthur.
[0:32:40] <%tearfuldevil> okay but like
[0:32:40] <+Flutts_> Seibah is my waifu
[0:32:49] <%tearfuldevil> wtf do they have to do with king arthur
[0:32:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:32:53] <phatmac16> WHEN’S SEIBAH?!?!
[0:32:54] <KalmVibrations> Nothing
[0:32:57] <CasualAlohaFriday> The name, that's it
[0:32:59] <+TopTieramisu> because king arthur has a cool sword
[0:33:08] <+TopTieramisu> also fate
[0:33:09] <%tearfuldevil> like, is japans knowledge of arthurian mythos like
[0:33:11] <%NWannabe> Hm....that is logical and sound point I cant argue with
[0:33:13] <TheVoltStrike> i see, a million of excalibur wielders from different worlds
[0:33:17] <TheVoltStrike> i can dig it
[0:33:18] <@CrankyVT> im late to the party but isn't it because they're all fighting to be like King Arthur or something
[0:33:18] <%tearfuldevil> disney's sword and the stone
[0:33:22] <@CrankyVT> and arthur is just a candidate title
[0:33:23] <+Jaysky> Are you telling me excaliber is a future rocket-gun?
[0:33:33] <+Flutts_> Give Saber a rocket launcher
[0:33:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> So excalibur is just an arm cannon in one world?
[0:33:37] <fangovafang> shit lol
[0:33:41] <Khorneflakes_> cohhTOS
[0:33:43] <+TopTieramisu> excalibur is whatever you want it to be
[0:33:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> and excalibur is also Iori in another world?
[0:33:47] <TheBensonator_> Pull the rocket-gun cannon sword from the stone
[0:33:49] <phatmac16> Mysterious Heroine XX has a rocket launcher
[0:33:51] <GeltonZ> @tearknack Yes. Now take that and anime it up. Make Merlin able to generate robot lolis. Now we're Million Arthur.
[0:33:51] <TheVoltStrike> is Iori Dark flame Arthur?
[0:33:52] <+PR0swagonist> we're all sabers now
[0:33:55] <+Flutts_> the real excalibur is the friends we made along the way
[0:34:00] <%NWannabe> excalibur is the friends you made along the way
[0:34:05] <%tearfuldevil> like id you wanna see "king arther but in a different setting" look at the old webcomic "arthur king of time and space"
[0:34:06] <%NWannabe> DAMMIT
[0:34:11] <Garrison27> Thought excaliber was a beam saber?
[0:34:14] <%tearfuldevil> which was surreal and had shitty art
[0:34:18] <+Rivalsz> that assist was too slow
[0:34:19] <+Jaysky> That ain't Arthur
[0:34:25] <+TopTieramisu> saber's not even the best arthur in fate
[0:34:28] <+Flutts_> @NWannabe get outplayed
[0:34:29] <+Jaysky> That's a highschool girl
[0:34:31] <%tearfuldevil> but actually like, went through a basic version of the standard arthurian legend
[0:34:33] <CasualAlohaFriday> Actually, I think Arthur was male in Knights of the Round
[0:34:35] <ShutenDragoon> Snow White
[0:34:37] <%NWannabe> ok, one more match and im going back to old rpgs
[0:34:37] <phatmac16> Fate but bad
[0:34:38] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus It's a mobile Gatcha game.
[0:34:45] <JacktheMan18> @WoolieVersus Zex is also a character I'd think you'd like
[0:34:49] <%jetjagger222> @CasualAlohaFriday there was also an arthur anime in the 80s
[0:34:53] <fuji_92> 3 arthurs?
[0:34:56] <JacktheMan18> Woolie specifically
[0:34:58] <+PR0swagonist> punch girl has been chosen
[0:35:01] <KalmVibrations> Awwww ye, EF, let's go
[0:35:01] <SomersaultJustice> is that the girl from trials of mana?
[0:35:02] <+Jaysky> It sure as shit looks like one
[0:35:04] <arkv01> thats the new trend baybee, gacha into fightaan
[0:35:06] <+TopTieramisu> punch girl? or claw girl?
[0:35:07] <%NWannabe> Ofc its gacha...i got ya
[0:35:10] <GeltonZ> @SomersaultJustice Yup
[0:35:13] <+Jaysky> Looks like claw girl
[0:35:16] <redrins> there are several million arthur mobile games even
[0:35:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> They're all reincarnations of King Arthur apparently
[0:35:17] <@Menitta> man, why can't Kyo be a guest character in anything
[0:35:21] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus reisz (the spear girl woolie played round 1) is from Trials of Mana
[0:35:21] <+Jaysky> Claw girls are top tier cuties
[0:35:26] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The Arcana in Arcana Blood is because this is made by the Arcana Heart team.
[0:35:26] <phatmac16> Didn’t the company that make this close down?
[0:35:28] <KalmVibrations> Eternal Flame's dash speed is kinda nuts
[0:35:29] <rubbishbinge> Yep, it was a gacha game where all the supports your using were attack cards
[0:35:29] <+TopTieramisu> kyo's not popular enough
[0:35:31] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus (reggie, i mena)
[0:35:31] <SuperFightinRobot> Arcana Heart fans represent from inside of your prison cells!
[0:35:35] <@Solidus_113> Factor in their cost too
[0:35:36] <+TopTieramisu> i bet k' is more popular than kyo at this point
[0:35:37] <rubbishbinge> Honestly it was alright
[0:35:39] <@Menitta> BUT KYO IS AWESOME
[0:35:39] <phatmac16> BEST DOGGO
[0:35:39] <Korgororo> can't really get annoyed at anime diddling mythology when DC,Marvel and god know who else also does it
[0:35:43] <TheVoltStrike> yo is that Cyber Cú!?
[0:35:45] <%jetjagger222> king kullen
[0:35:46] <arkv01> big tidds
[0:35:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> Gacha is the devil but if it allows hype ass anime fighters, I'll allow it
[0:35:48] <fuji_92> chuchu train
[0:35:49] <+angelmorphic> You literally picked a loliu
[0:35:50] <+TopTieramisu> @Menitta i agree. but that doesn't change popularity
[0:35:51] <%tearfuldevil> hey aoife
[0:35:53] <Sol_Install> oh there's hi-score girl at the bottom
[0:35:56] <phatmac16> THATS NOT MY CU
[0:35:57] <%NWannabe> No way, K9999 is more popular than both of them @TopTieramisu
[0:35:57] <+Flutts_> There's one good gacha, and that's Azur Lane
[0:35:59] <+RichardMF_> @woolieversus its made by the arcana peopl
[0:36:09] <%jetjagger222> he's not in blue spandex and sexy
[0:36:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If you spend money on a gacha game you're a coward
[0:36:11] <+TopTieramisu> @NWannabe and will never be in another game again
[0:36:12] <shadowmaksim> Geez, Woolie sounds so enthused right now.
[0:36:16] <%NWannabe> yo guys....look at this background
[0:36:19] <+jiggy_snipe> the otherwordlies are guest characters
[0:36:22] <Garrison27> A question for chat: Does anyone hate Fate more than the people who love Fate?
[0:36:22] <+Jaysky> It's awful
[0:36:23] <@Menitta> Tetsuzanko
[0:36:24] <arkv01> those are some cuteass background chibis VoHiYo
[0:36:26] <%jetjagger222> WTF is that background
[0:36:35] <TheBensonator_> But... but when do they tell me their select?
[0:36:42] <+Jaysky> Never
[0:36:42] <+Flutts_> what does it mean
[0:36:43] <%NWannabe> @TopTieramisu im ok with it...so long as kensou gets some story focus
[0:36:43] <+LTKonnor> There's a lot happening in that background
[0:36:43] <Korgororo> it's the chibi world pvpS
[0:36:49] <CasualAlohaFriday> @Garrison27 Fate? From Negima?
[0:36:51] <+Flutts_> what is a kingdom's junction
[0:36:54] <arkv01> BBB huh
[0:36:57] <+Flutts_> how do I tell you my select
[0:37:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> Oh yeah that background looks exactly like promo art for some gacha game that I never heard of
[0:37:09] <phatmac16> @garrison27 I hate FGO but I love FSN so I guess you’re right.
[0:37:09] <%NWannabe> You talk with your fists, duh
[0:37:23] <+TopTieramisu> @NWannabe k9999 will never be in another game because he's a blatant tetsuo ripoff. they even replaced him mr. sandman style in kof 2002 UM
[0:37:26] <CasualAlohaFriday> Oh, the series. I'm eh on it
[0:37:29] <SuperTurboSABER> that's some android 18 shit
[0:37:30] <+Jaysky> That dash
[0:37:39] <+TopTieramisu> kensou is cool though
[0:37:43] <NevikGamina> bruh Flame is so fast wtf
[0:37:45] <%NWannabe> @TopTieramisu Right, but at least we got Angel
[0:37:50] <CasualAlohaFriday> Yeah, I'd rather have Nameless than K9999
[0:37:53] <KalmVibrations> EF's J. D is fucking amazing
[0:37:54] <TheBensonator_> BRUH
[0:37:58] <+TopTieramisu> angel is hella sick. she even has haruhara haruko's VA in 2k2
[0:38:04] <+TopTieramisu> too bad they changed her VA
[0:38:17] <%NWannabe> @TopTieramisu Yeh, the original nyahs were best
[0:38:17] <%tearfuldevil> @Garrison27 i love fate/zero, kara no kyoukai, and dislike to hate every single other fate related property
[0:38:26] <%tearfuldevil> so thats fairly spot one
[0:38:30] <CasualAlohaFriday> More Angel wouldn't be a bad thing yet
[0:38:43] <%tearfuldevil> i imagine most fate fans with taste (i am not one of those) got out years ago
[0:38:44] <+Jaysky> Zero and UBW were good, I prefer Zero though
[0:38:57] <%NWannabe> @TopTieramisu back to Kensou though. I just wanna see this dragon power they honey dick me with
[0:38:58] <%jetjagger222> @tearknack the original VN is fine
[0:38:58] <+Flutts_> hot take Zero and UBW are the only good Fate series
[0:39:07] <+Jaysky> Is that a hot take though?
[0:39:12] <+Jaysky> It's true
[0:39:14] <NevikGamina> Kreygasm
[0:39:16] <+TopTieramisu> yeah. it'd be cool to see kensou's evolution
[0:39:17] <%NWannabe> Hot Take, they shoulda stuck with Tsukihime
[0:39:19] <wangan> If you mean super cold take then yeah
[0:39:20] <phatmac16> The VN is the best Fate thing and Zero is overrated.
[0:39:21] <TheVoltStrike> fate has so many entries tho
[0:39:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> uhhh idk shit about fate but the "umu" girl is kinda cute
[0:39:32] <+TopTieramisu> i definitely would rather see kensou's development over that new dumbass protagonist with the 2 ghost hands
[0:39:35] <LeaIsChill> Is Fate the one with the magical girl make out session?
[0:39:36] <%tearfuldevil> kara no kyoukai is sic, allthough its not really fate
[0:39:39] <+Flutts_> I enjoyed the VN when I played a version without the weird sex scenes
[0:39:41] <%NWannabe> DUo Lon?
[0:39:52] <%tearfuldevil> the VN is.....okay
[0:39:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:54] <%NWannabe> OR the kof 14 ones
[0:39:55] <+Flutts_> where sex is described as mollusks crashing into each other
[0:39:55] <alephalpha> knk is same timeline as fate
[0:40:12] <alephalpha> tsuki is different timeline
[0:40:12] <Ner234> Well then
[0:40:14] <+cvp5127> do i hear aoi yuuki?
[0:40:15] <%NWannabe> ...what just happened?
[0:40:15] <+TopTieramisu> @NWannabe are you talking to me? if so, i mean the dude with the headphones and way too many colors in his outfit
[0:40:15] <phatmac16> Yeah the sex is bad except in HF which makes sense for Shirou’s character arc.
[0:40:16] <Korgororo> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:40:18] <NevikGamina> PogChamp

[0:40:38] <+SuperKirby24> PogChamp
[0:40:46] <JacktheMan18> Yeah that was her lvl 3
[0:40:47] <+Jaysky> |/
[0:40:54] <+TopTieramisu> @NWannabe yeah. i didn't even know he was the protagonist until i read that manga that's based on kof 14
[0:41:00] <%NWannabe> Ok cats and kittens, back to my jrpgs. Stay weebin'
[0:41:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> @kosorsomesaykosm_ I'm sorry :(
[0:41:09] <TheBensonator_> This is getting sick... but all these lolis tho
[0:41:11] <+TopTieramisu> @NWannabe you should check out that manga btw. the art's so good
[0:41:22] <+TopTieramisu> still ongoing though
[0:41:31] <%jetjagger222> read kengan ashura
[0:41:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @FuqBoiSlim it's ok, I have stopped questioning it years ago
[0:41:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> @bensonplayspokemon the pedophilia is a bonus
[0:41:49] <+TopTieramisu> kengan asura is great too. but the mangaka for the kof manga really captures the kof characters well
[0:41:49] <GeltonZ> @bensonplayspokemon I say they ain't lolis if they have tits!
[0:41:56] <%kyh9> what is this weeb nonsense
[0:42:00] <Korgororo> Kengan ashura Kreygasm
[0:42:01] <+Flutts_> it's okay officer she had boobs
[0:42:06] <+TopTieramisu> even though it's a bit spread thin with all the characters
[0:42:07] <+Rivalsz> wait is that neptunia colors?
[0:42:20] <sappinmahbinyot> isnt iori in this game?
[0:42:27] <+Jaysky> He is
[0:42:28] <+TopTieramisu> ye
[0:42:31] <sappinmahbinyot> pog
[0:42:31] <GeltonZ> @sappinmahbinyot Yeah you just missed him
[0:42:39] <sappinmahbinyot> unpog
[0:42:42] <phatmac16> Iori from that isekai manga
[0:42:46] <TheVoltStrike> Nep Nep in a fg never :(
[0:42:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> Like how that one fireball changed the stage background for a bit
[0:42:59] <%jetjagger222> glacius shit
[0:43:08] <+TopTieramisu> that black outfit girl is chuuni af
[0:43:09] <shadowmaksim> Yeah, figured as much. You can't play games like this without people going full FBI/pedophilia meme mode on you. Still sucks.
[0:43:11] <+Flutts_> SICK
[0:43:19] <Solidnick18> animoo
[0:43:24] <TheBensonator_> These animations are so CLEAN
[0:43:26] <alephalpha> RADICAL
[0:43:29] <+Flutts_> @shadowmaksim I actually love stuff like this
[0:43:32] <dellis80> * Megunin orgasm *
[0:43:35] <sappinmahbinyot> Did they really animate all that? Damn that's actually kinda insane
[0:43:37] <GeltonZ> @TopTieramisu The other girl has an EYEPATCH! They're BOTH Chuuni! This is Super Chuuni Fighter!
[0:43:38] <TheVoltStrike> can we eliminate the announcer
[0:43:39] <SomersaultJustice> plz pick rietz
[0:43:51] <peachy996> Man I forgot Tekken Tunes doesn't have Heihachi and Yoshimitsu Tekken 2 themes, shit sucks
[0:43:56] <+angelmorphic> I jsut got here why the fuck was iori on the screen?
[0:43:58] <@Menitta> I want a super casual announcer
[0:43:58] <+TopTieramisu> @GeltonZ guess it's settled. iori is undeniably chuuni
[0:43:59] <+Rivalsz> pantsu
[0:44:00] <KnivesEve> is that iori? xD
[0:44:02] <phatmac16> @shadowmaksim Only cultured gentlemen play games with lolis
[0:44:03] <+Flutts_> Shantae colors
[0:44:04] <%jetjagger222> @peachy996 but TTT1 yoshi theme though
[0:44:06] <+Jaysky> What a tomboy fighter?
[0:44:09] <@Menitta> "Yo lemme know who you playin"
[0:44:10] <GeltonZ> @TopTieramisu I mean...he kinda is...
[0:44:14] <sappinmahbinyot> SNK getting that money
[0:44:19] <+Jaysky> *That a
[0:44:28] <peachy996> @jetjagger222 True but I got that on another playlist
[0:44:41] <+TopTieramisu> @GeltonZ yeah. he's the chuuni while kyo's the annoyed normie classmate
[0:44:42] <GeltonZ> "Clone Techno-Smith Arthur"
[0:44:45] <Korgororo> I wonder who in Japan started the bikini thief girl trope
[0:44:52] <%jetjagger222> lancelot looks like the dude version of fate arthur
[0:44:54] <@CrankyVT> that aife assist with that diagonal helm splitter seems like a must-have
[0:44:55] <+TopTieramisu> monkey punch?
[0:44:58] <+Flutts_> probably some obscure 70s manga
[0:45:02] <+Rivalsz> my cousin plays it
[0:45:03] <+Jaysky> PLS tell her your select
[0:45:03] <+TopTieramisu> lupin III
[0:45:05] <+Rivalsz> but he ain't on
[0:45:06] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus I'M READY! I only started 2 days ago but I'm ready!

[0:45:17] <Keith_Chop> this is just hyde
[0:45:18] <sappinmahbinyot> Why is he so big
[0:45:32] <+Jaysky> y she so smol
[0:45:42] <CasualAlohaFriday> @Korgororo It goes at least as far back as Chrono Cross around the turn of the century. I t probably goes back farther.

[0:46:31] <@CrankyVT> i mean, DQ3 started the whole warrior bikini armor thing, so maybe it spun off from that somewhere

[0:52:18] <sappinmahbinyot> wtf was that move
[0:52:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> strongest butt attacks
[0:52:40] <+Rivalsz> this game is shameless now

[0:53:46] <leomuratore> this games is nuts!
[0:53:57] <Korgororo> this is kinda crazy
[0:53:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:54:06] <GeltonZ> This game is really good. I tried it for the first time like two days ago and fell in love.
[0:54:07] <%tearfuldevil> game looks fun but 75% of a fighting game is the community
[0:54:12] <+Urdunngurdunn> A lot of Reggie voice clips tonight, huh?
[0:54:12] <fuji_92> yeah, this game is hella interesting, but ain't buy something dead
[0:54:14] <Natsu_or_whatever> shout out to the one brave dude who played the wolf chick at Mag, and fucking obliterated people
[0:54:14] <shadowmaksim> Bisclavet is the fanservice character of the game. So if anyone is worried, it doesn't get any worse than her.
[0:54:16] <Zayasu> what am i looking at
[0:54:20] <+Jaysky> That butt attack is mighty lewd
[0:54:20] <SomersaultJustice> I'm more interested in this than granblue
[0:54:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> powah upu uwu
[0:54:36] <+jiggy_snipe> this looks fun but man there's alot going on
[0:54:40] <%tearfuldevil> ^
[0:54:42] <+kitdude192> @WoolieVersus One Steo from Eden is out! :3
[0:54:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What does that phrase even mena
[0:54:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cute
[0:55:01] <%BubbaRands> ara ara~ Kreygasm
[0:55:08] <crimsonsaens> Did Woolie pick the boss character?
[0:55:23] <GeltonZ> Also TECHNICALLY that's a wolf girl. Her anger turned her into a werewolf...but it makes her stronger so she doesn't care about turning back.
[0:55:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> did that giant do a dodge roll last match?
[0:55:25] <fuji_92> nah, Reggie this time e
[0:55:29] <+PR0swagonist> woolie picked butt queen
[0:55:36] <+Taglog7> Kreygasm Groceries
[0:55:39] <dellis80> Face sitting??
[0:55:47] <+R_BChe> omg zero crossup fashback
[0:55:48] <GeltonZ> @dellis80 Face sitting.
[0:55:52] <KalmVibrations> Snow White is the worst character, so no
[0:55:53] <TheBensonator_> Oh lort
[0:56:01] <+Flutts_> does she have an ass strike
[0:56:01] <%BubbaRands> Juggles Kreygasm
[0:56:10] <maplemillk> Oh ma I love Blazb- hey wait a minute
[0:56:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> *SNIIIIIIIIIF* OH YEES QUITE PUNGENT INDEED
[0:56:15] <dellis80> oh, and an ass bump
[0:56:22] <crimsonsaens> The damage proration looks nuts
[0:56:23] <+Flutts_> brrrrrrrrrap
[0:56:36] <Natsu_or_whatever> this game is; as they say in the business: Fuckin wild dude
[0:56:38] <%jetjagger222> iron man colors
[0:56:45] <shadowmaksim> The game actually has very aggressive guts. The timer running out is actually not rare.
[0:56:47] <+Flutts_> can she do an infinite
[0:57:17] <%jetjagger222> that's pretty nasty for locking down
[0:57:22] <GarbageNirvana> This looks like what Blazblue players would be into if they had no shame
[0:57:22] <SomersaultJustice> I hope my grandchildren will one day see that super connect
[0:57:31] <maplemillk> Where does Woolie find these games?
[0:57:38] <crimsonsaens> It's disturbing the rear character portraits don't change with your colors
[0:57:46] <SomersaultJustice> riesz!
[0:57:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> People tell him about them on twitter
[0:57:59] <%BubbaRands> What if Makoto Nanaya had a hammer?
[0:58:02] <shadowmaksim> @crimsonsaens That's cause the colors are supposed to indicate what element they are.
[0:58:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sword v sword
[0:58:11] <TheBensonator_> That was, indeed, one complete ass rail change
[0:58:13] <dellis80> Yo, her sword is SEALED, lol
[0:58:14] <GeltonZ> Now THAT is some HAIR!
[0:58:16] <+cowkid222> does Iori get a crazy title too?
[0:58:31] <GeltonZ> @cowkid222 Otherworldly Iori because he's a guest.
[0:58:34] <mzrx7> @cowkid222 guest chars get a generic title
[0:58:44] <+jiggy_snipe> all the arthurs
[0:58:50] <shadowmaksim> @cowkid222 Just "Otherworldly". It's used for the guest characters.
[0:58:55] <%jetjagger222> no arthur the aardvark though
[0:58:55] <DaCheekyOne> Nice chinchin
[0:58:56] <fuji_92> why are there so many arthurs

[0:59:12] <sappinmahbinyot> Iori's title should be "Not-A-Tsundere"

[1:01:28] <shadowmaksim> Iai Arthur is like the best character in the game. Low damage, for the most part, but she has ridiculous mix and combos. She's also the only character with a Boss version.

[1:03:30] <count_bob> Why not Reggie? You already want to cream little girls.
[1:03:34] <+cowkid222> oh what the hell why hahaha
[1:03:37] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus There's a patch to add the dick grab back in.
[1:03:48] <TheVoltStrike> holy fuck that is
[1:03:53] <Shardlab> She's got quite a bit of Namarya's kit
[1:03:54] <wangan> @sappinmahbinyot She’s also one of the best assists, so you see a lot of dick grabs
[1:04:22] <GeltonZ> @wangan @sappinmahbinyot I wanna see tournaments of this with the announcers shouting "GET THAT DICK!!!"
[1:04:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> the dick grab is a low that forces a restand apparently
[1:04:35] <shadowmaksim> Really? I heard it was just okay. People just use it a lot for the meme.
[1:04:36] <Vashido22> So that's why Iori came to this game: he can cancel his sweep

[1:07:56] <%Mawari_> Mawari_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! A good game, ask spider or airmaster for techs :D
[1:07:58] <shadowmaksim> Nimue is the charge character. Those bits can be delayed by holding the command. She also has a charge buster as just shown.
[1:07:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20

[1:08:14] <maplemillk> aw that's a cool detail actually
[1:08:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:08:34] <Hoarseplay> Iori is anything but regular.
[1:08:36] <fuji_92> LUL
[1:08:46] <leomuratore> He looks so out of place here, but he's sprite is nice

[1:09:11] <fuji_92> I wanna see Iori lvl 3
[1:09:13] <maplemillk> This fight is basically Jojo part 3 character designs vs Jojo part 6
[1:09:15] <YakumoYomi> Agreed. I'd go as far to say that Iori's sprite here looks better than his 3D model
[1:09:20] <+jiggy_snipe> man this witch is talking alot

[1:10:22] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 57 minutes
[1:10:25] <JacktheMan18> Iori is really good in this
[1:10:27] <shadowmaksim> About mid from what I heard.
[1:10:28] <dellis80> Theory: Lori lost a fight and didnt finish a set, and got knocked into another dimension whith magical sword fighting Arthur clone loli's , and is trying to get back to finish the match.
[1:10:33] <maplemillk> So do all the supers suck in this game or have I not been here long enough?
[1:10:34] <Hoarseplay> Iori's good because he's Iori.
[1:10:35] <fuji_92> in general or here? here he's ok
[1:10:37] <mr_ESB> High tier like most kof games? Lmao
[1:10:42] <JacktheMan18> They gave him an airdash and he can cancel specials from sweep
[1:10:56] <JacktheMan18> Plus the strengths he had already
[1:11:06] <%BubbaRands> Stand powa Kreygasm
[1:11:09] <SomersaultJustice> I'm guessing you set up the shield so you have time to throw out your homing stuff

[1:17:41] <shadowmaksim> A lot of the big swings with the hammer have sweet spots.
[1:17:45] <+TheFabledAble> "And then the cosplayers fought"
[1:17:55] <cumurasame> @jetjagger222 Oh, cool... yeah I don't care too much for them besides the main3, mainly because... well I haven't had a chance to play Masoukishin. I think Masaki and Cybuster look cool as hell though.

[1:20:53] <maplemillk> Aw sweet eyepatch
[1:20:58] <shadowmaksim> It's not that she doesn't do damage, it's that she heavily relies on doing long combos since she has access to every element.

[1:24:10] <DaCheekyOne> Mist Finer girl is apparently top tier
[1:24:16] <DaCheekyOne> Go figure
[1:24:21] <shadowmaksim> @sappinmahbinyot When you burst, you gain a 3rd bar. Otherwise, you start with 2.
[1:24:26] <maplemillk> Give it to these people to be really good at a game I'm not even convinced exists
[1:24:26] <%tearfuldevil> @jetjagger222 yeah this game seems a bit gross but the characters are actually pretty cool in terms of how they fight, even if i don't particularly care for the designs
[1:24:30] <sappinmahbinyot> interesting

[1:27:35] <maplemillk> THIS IS HYPE RN
[1:27:43] <%RyTYoung> WE POPPIN NOW
[1:27:48] <+tyrant00000> it's his ammo type
[1:27:56] <shadowmaksim> @crimsonsaens Those are the element stocks. His character can absorb elements from his assists and shoot element bullets. He has none now so it's nuetral.
[1:27:56] <floralkami> doesn't this game use rollback, or am I mistaken?
[1:27:59] <SomersaultJustice> LUL

[1:29:15] <floralkami> this game doesn't use rollback, does it?
[1:29:15] <+0rri_Android> Kreygasm
[1:29:16] <%Tenchi_G> nice chin chin
[1:29:19] <shadowmaksim> @crimsonsaens Kinda. But it only really matters for extending combos using the element mechanic, which no one has really used so far.
[1:29:28] <NevikGamina> PogChamp

[1:30:19] <blckmgx> prease tell me your select
[1:30:27] <sappinmahbinyot> This is the most ridiculous thing I've gotten hype over.
[1:30:31] <%NWannabe> Getting Junctioned
[1:30:48] <floralkami> in the function
[1:30:54] <+chiazam> Choked
[1:30:55] <+R_BChe> is this delay or rollback
[1:30:56] <sappinmahbinyot> That quirky assist looks annoying as fuck
[1:31:29] <cumurasame> Woolie you've got to use LADY to defeat VERGIL
[1:31:35] <shadowmaksim> That arcade assist can actually be delayed if you hold the command. But after a couple seconds, it triggers automatically.
[1:31:49] <ShitpostGaming> Getting fancy on you
[1:31:50] <NevikGamina> oh god this is just Lady vs Vergil LUL
[1:31:52] <%NWannabe> KoF taught me not to underestimate rolls
[1:31:57] <+mr_miyagucci> steam reviews say the netplay is bad not sure if its delay but I think it is likely
[1:31:58] <%NWannabe> They're part of a well balanced meal
[1:32:02] <%NWannabe> speaking of meals
[1:32:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SICK
[1:32:05] <+Qsmash_> mixed
[1:32:08] <GeltonZ> Tatsunoko vs Capcom taught me not to underestimate Rolls

[1:34:30] <sappinmahbinyot> This MU right here
[1:34:34] <%tearfuldevil> thhis game looks pretty fun, ngl
[1:34:54] <+TheBesteban> Arcade cab assist is such bs. I love it
[1:35:02] <%jetjagger222> its similar to a haoh sho ko ken
[1:35:05] <%tearfuldevil> not gonna buy it cause its like 55 bucks
[1:35:08] <maplemillk> High Score Girl is a good assist but an even better show
[1:35:08] <@Menitta> this reminds me of that Nicalis indie fighter
[1:35:22] <sappinmahbinyot> @tearknack 55? wut? fr?
[1:35:23] <+Rivalsz> he mashing yall.
[1:35:23] <SomersaultJustice> yeyeye

[1:35:52] <sappinmahbinyot> Oh. I'da been bruh'd
[1:35:52] <+Rivalsz> thats a strange blade, swordsman :^)
[1:35:57] <shadowmaksim> For anyone wondering, this was developed by Team Arcana (formerly Examu). So "Aquapazza", "Nitroplus Blasterz", "Daemon Bride", etc.
[1:36:04] <+PR0swagonist> Its basically chao code's pick two move
[1:36:10] <@Menitta> I still wanna get that because it's got Quote and Curly Brace
[1:36:11] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:36:13] <+Rivalsz> NITRO BLASTERS IS POGGERS
[1:36:15] <%tearfuldevil> team arcana seems to do decent work
[1:36:16] <waifoong98> Blasterz was assist heavy too no?
[1:36:16] <maplemillk> Team Arcana didn't develop Arcana heart?
[1:36:24] <shadowmaksim> They did.
[1:36:26] <%tearfuldevil> jsut wish they made games with aesthetics i liked
[1:36:32] <+Rivalsz> It is
[1:36:34] <fuji_92> what's the name of the gacha this is based of?
[1:36:42] <waifoong98> Million Authur
[1:36:47] <fuji_92> cool
[1:36:48] <shadowmaksim> Million Arthur...something. There's a bunch of entries.
[1:36:51] <+jiggy_snipe> team arcana is responsible for Arcana Heart
[1:36:55] <YakumoYomi> The only thing I know about Nitro Blasterz is that Homura and Sonico are in it. I never got around to playing it.
[1:36:56] <%tearfuldevil> are there actually a million arthurs?
[1:37:03] <%tearfuldevil> if not trash
[1:37:06] <%tearfuldevil> i mean
[1:37:09] <+Rivalsz> yall get your copy of 3d love max?
[1:37:17] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:37:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he knew
[1:37:20] <+TheBesteban> I just started story mode. there are at least 2.5 million arthurs
[1:37:35] <%tearfuldevil> nice
[1:37:40] <maplemillk> Guilty Gear singlehandedly made this happen
[1:37:41] <+Jaysky> Wolf butt.
[1:37:43] <%jetjagger222> MAKE A FIGHT
[1:37:44] <+jiggy_snipe> Square loves their junctions Kappa
[1:37:45] <+PR0swagonist> its a very easy way to keep making new characters with wild abaddon
[1:37:49] <YakumoYomi> Love Max? I thought we were on Six Stars now?
[1:37:52] <@Menitta> This is why KI has the best fight start quote
[1:37:59] <@Menitta> it's just R E A D Y
[1:37:59] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @ggbhtg
[1:38:01] <Hoarseplay> The odd thing is the round call sounds more like a character select call.
[1:38:02] <aluddss> Can't escape from crossing fate
[1:38:04] <DaCheekyOne> Yall know how westerners like asian tattoos? This is the same but in reverse
[1:38:07] <JacktheMan18> Riesz has the pogo too
[1:38:14] <shadowmaksim> Six Stars Xtend actually. Thought that's only in backer Beta at the moment.
[1:38:21] <waifoong98> There is also a short 1 min series they release every few months in SE jp channel, no English though so don't expect much
[1:38:27] <+TheBesteban> The fact that you can delay the cab toss is awesome
[1:38:30] <KnivesEve> was that onno from hi score girl
[1:38:33] <+TheBesteban> Yes
[1:38:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[1:38:38] <%tearfuldevil> my fighting game start would be "LET BLOOD BE SPILT"
[1:38:41] <maplemillk> yes thankfully
[1:38:43] <+Rivalsz> that out in the states?
[1:38:51] <sappinmahbinyot> Yknow I never had any motivation for multiple trials of mana playthroughs
[1:38:54] <sappinmahbinyot> But like
[1:38:55] <sappinmahbinyot> with the remake
[1:38:56] <%jetjagger222> @tearknack you might like weaponlord
[1:39:02] <sappinmahbinyot> the combat is actually gonna motivate me to do so lol
[1:39:07] <+nechallenger> BELIEVE IN VICTORY
[1:39:16] <sappinmahbinyot> Anyone else always gonna run Kevin on their team in Trials tho?
[1:39:20] <+Jaysky> SHOT THROUGH THE HEART
[1:39:22] <TheArrow_> SHE'S FUCKING DEAD
[1:39:26] <YakumoYomi> Seeing Riesz makes me even more hype for the SD3 remake. The demo is pretty solid on all platforms (although the Switch version has a lower frame rate).
[1:39:27] <%tearfuldevil> @jetjagger222 saw some in the old sbfp days, salright i guess
[1:39:27] <sappinmahbinyot> DEAD
[1:39:31] <@CrankyVT> and thats the most love Seiken 3 ever got until Trials of Mana
[1:39:31] <+SuperKirby24> FUCKING DEAD

[1:40:35] <YakumoYomi> I might have to buy this now, since Greenmangaming has it on sale for less than $20.
[1:40:35] <shadowmaksim> Element system aside, this is basically "Nitroplus Blasterz" with a different IP.
[1:40:37] <+Rivalsz> twin blade literally kiriton from dengeki bunko
[1:40:38] <JacktheMan18> @WoolieVersus I wanted to show you some cool bazooka girl tech
[1:40:40] <%jetjagger222> bisclavert looks super oppressive with the right assists
[1:40:40] <%tearfuldevil> million arthur looks fun, never gonna buy it and i can't go to cons so i'm never gonna play it
