[0:04:50] <+TopTieramisu> getting revenge on minh is pointless, since he sandbags those as well

[0:36:33] <joylent_blue> woolie has been the one yelling if anything
[0:36:43] <@Menitta> This game is great because it has something from every Zelda style
[0:36:50] <Dalkalopagus> The map layout is randomly generated with every playthrough
[0:36:50] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:36:50] <ScareCrow100> So Zelda but with a rythm game mechanic
[0:36:53] <+Ace5335> the map is generated
[0:36:54] <sir_nack> woolie's a normal human being that can hear music, so he's fine
[0:36:54] <BrikkSteele> Oh dip, it's multiplayer?!
[0:36:55] <+NerevaRising> I think the map is procedurally generated
[0:36:57] <+gooniekorn> banger alert
[0:36:58] <sileo_patronus> The map layout is actually randomised by playthrough
[0:36:59] <Prevot> need time stop
[0:37:03] <+GrislyBoar> It's rogue-lite. Dungeons are randomized and the overworld is generated on each new file.
[0:37:24] <TheRickyWill> its a bit of both because the entire overworld, aside from setpieces, are entirely random
[0:38:06] <sir_nack> god this cave theme is SO GOOD
[0:38:18] <Enyoyable> Need G U N
[0:38:30] <%Tuna_Can_0> just once
[0:38:45] <ihateyouo> most of the map is random gen
[0:39:10] <$eco419> B)
[0:39:20] <Mirakei> i imagine it randomizes once you make/start your new save file but things stay in place after that untill you create a new game/save file again

[1:11:24] <SomersaultJustice> it's already failed again
[1:11:30] <sileo_patronus> standing still only keeps the beat when you enter the room
[1:11:31] <%ALTRNico> now ruin it
[1:11:46] <%Wool> you guys missed the beat
[1:11:47] <+skizzuto> you guys missed a beat
[1:11:49] <jbrooksdev> THEY MISSED THE BEAT FIRST GUY
[1:11:52] <SomersaultJustice> you can tell if it's failed if the eyes stop flashing
[1:11:58] <WllmBrandt> When the light in the eyes of the chest go out, you failed
[1:12:02] <Tisaric> The eyes tell if it's enabled
[1:12:02] <velgaduere> at least the Deku Scrub is gone now
[1:12:05] <%Wool> hey it's easier now without the deku scrub
[1:12:12] <%Wool> NOPE
[1:12:16] <velgaduere> you DO miss the beat if you stand still
[1:12:18] <GKannel> standing still missed beat
[1:12:19] <+Ascethetic> you missed the beat
[1:12:22] <AxelCezar> zelda is so fucking adorable here
[1:12:24] <$SilverRoddo> “You’re suppose the listen to the notes she’s not playing.”
[1:12:26] <velgaduere> you MUST perform an action to not miss the beat
[1:12:28] <%Wool> HAHAHA
[1:12:30] <+skizzuto> you miss a beat if you stand still for too long
[1:12:32] <TheWe4pon> ONce you start moving you cant stop
[1:12:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:35] <+Aztec50> you cant stand still
[1:12:38] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus you miss a beat if you stand still, standing still is only okay when you enter the room
[1:12:42] <+Aztec50> or not nvm
[1:12:54] <Tisaric> co-op probably changes that rules
[1:12:57] <sileo_patronus> standing still only keeps the beat when you enter the room
[1:12:58] <+allups> so is it screen by screen rogue like?
[1:12:58] <TheRickyWill> “just drive the van Reggie”
[1:12:59] <SomersaultJustice> you can't stop moving after you start
[1:13:00] <That_Mojo> maybe it's needing to move with the beat
[1:13:23] <@Menitta> Co-op makes this way harder lol
[1:13:33] <%Wool> how long are they going to be stuck on this one screen
[1:13:39] <Tisaric> yeah co op is making this way harder than it usually is
[1:13:40] <+TheImmortal70> SHIELDING is fine
[1:13:43] <+TheImmortal70> But not standing still
[1:13:44] <velgaduere> shielding is an action. not performing an action loses the beat
[1:13:44] <+BlueCenter77> shield is not standing still
[1:13:44] <sileo_patronus> Shielding is not standing still
[1:13:57] <TheRickyWill> shielding is not standinf
[1:14:02] <%ALTRNico> Is someone keeping count on how many tries?

[1:24:02] <alrobot2014> pants shitting
[1:24:04] <FenixSeraph> Shit pants will drain your enemy's nutrients and fluids
[1:24:08] <TheWe4pon> 24/7 shitting can kill someone
[1:24:11] <Laironx3> yare yare...
[1:24:14] <ElenaManetta> REGGiE asking TOUGH QUESTIONS
[1:24:14] <%ironohki> You can die from diarrhea.
[1:24:21] <DartonLance> you could be a hero saving people like pat who almost die from not shitting
[1:24:26] <+allups> with minh
[1:24:27] <FenixSeraph> Fatal diarrhea is one consequence of cholera
[1:24:28] <%ALTRNico> Minh is not wrong
[1:24:29] <+EndgameContent> Shitting your pants is a DoT
[1:24:30] <zal_silverfang> Disorientation Debuff versus Shame Debuff
[1:24:30] <ElenaManetta> Diarrhea can dehydrate you
[1:24:32] <fireking900> just dont wear pants tho
[1:24:36] <@Menitta> Yeah that does kinda ruin your day too
[1:24:37] <masterfire23> stand ability shit your pants
[1:24:39] <+allups> pluse all the porn u can make
[1:24:40] <$FuqBoiSlim> Emotional pain
[1:24:41] <+froduck42> swamp ass is a status effect
[1:24:43] <fireking900> fight buck naked
[1:24:48] <sileo_patronus> You can fight with shit in your pants, intense brainfreeze is a bigger in-fight distraction
[1:24:48] <alrobot2014> shit will always be with you
[1:24:49] <AltTab> Diarrhea is an AOE attack
[1:24:53] <TheAzureOracle> Okay what THE FUCK did I walk into?
[1:24:59] <AltTab> better in a crowded area
[1:25:00] <%faytthepally> Was the shit specified to be mud butt? Or are peanut logs on the menu?
[1:25:01] <+Prattlesworth> shitting yourself is a long term debuff
[1:25:04] <%jinking79> it becomes a weapon
[1:25:06] <+allups> diarrhea is AOE
[1:25:13] <alrobot2014> @sileo_patronus what if you have to fight while shitting
[1:25:13] <@Menitta> @TheAzureOracle lmao
[1:25:19] <Giothegame> Yea Hardcore Mecha came out yesterday and so far been enjoying it. Haven't tried the multiplayer modes yet
[1:25:20] <TheWe4pon> making people shit on command gets you a job in the porn industry @WoolieVersus
[1:25:25] <+SvenHolgersson> But what if your opponent has no dignity
[1:25:29] <Lady_M91> I'm taking mental damage from this conversation.
[1:25:31] <goose_attack_almanac> Brainfreeze is a mild inconvenience. Poopin' at will can dehydrate
[1:25:35] <%ironohki> I'm there.
[1:25:37] <%ironohki> I know that feel.
[1:25:42] <%ironohki> That is the struggle.
[1:25:49] <Mr_Ease> aaaaaaah thats me
[1:25:54] <$SilverRoddo> If you can deal with shit, I’ll take the poop-pants, because it becomes an effect power against your enemies at that point.
[1:25:54] <reonome> tfw haven't drawn in weeks
[1:26:00] <@Menitta> Man, I'm in college now and it sucks
[1:26:11] <+DrPoxx> How is that even a matchup? Shitting yourself is way more involved and destructive than an intense headache
[1:26:11] <%ironohki> I'm working on a graphic novel and I'm at about 1 page every 3 weeks.
[1:26:13] <%ironohki> It's pain.
[1:26:15] <FenixSeraph> have a lot of ideas and the last thing I drew was lewds
[1:26:24] <FenixSeraph> instead of all the actually cool shit I wanted to
[1:26:43] <%ironohki> ADULTHOOD IS BULLSHIT.

[1:50:10] <+Risingxiv> pretty much
[1:50:11] <+TechnicolorNinja> The Blank Ahead
[1:50:14] <worldbrand> ritual of the night is like a fairly good igavania, but curse of the moon is a fantastic classicvania. probably the best
[1:50:14] <NickHatesSnow> Aria is the best one
[1:50:26] <QaizerArt> yeah okay Johannes, go ahead and try to kill the mega demon guy
[1:50:30] <SelfMaidMan> dawn tho
[1:50:36] <MarylandJutsu> Aria of Sorrow is amazing its true

[1:57:45] <Goraka91> So the aesthetic i'm getting out of this is (Blood) stained windows?
[1:57:54] <SixthSun2> Equip a weapon @WoolieVersus
[1:57:54] <Buzzard42> tbh Curse of the Moon is better than the full game
[1:57:57] <AxelCezar> curse of the moon is like a prequel in retro game style with multiple characters and endings 40% off now on steam
[1:57:59] <@akuda_bar> stupid sexy zubaz
[1:57:59] <RiceeFTW> the aesthetic is NOT castlevania
[1:58:14] <SomersaultJustice> it was going to be the prequel, but then they made it non canon
[1:58:20] <$FuqBoiSlim> Yikes, Ninty....
[1:58:21] <+REDtheBEAST> I 100% this game a few days ago, im hoping that you enjoy this game @WoolieVersus SeemsGood
[1:58:26] <worldbrand> @Buzzard42 for what it was trying to be, i gotta agree... seeing those bosses again was a comparative letdown
[1:58:28] <Buzzard42> yeah the Switch version is really bad, I'm super mad about it
[1:58:52] <YellowDays> whats wrong with the switch version
[1:58:53] <+legitimatejohnathan> THE STORM IS HERE ⚡ sbfpBaz ⚡
[1:59:08] <+Bananaking744> is woolies mic off?
[1:59:09] <Goraka91> The Switch version of EVERYTHING is really bad FeelsBadMan
[1:59:10] <AxelCezar> the switch port is straight up broken
[1:59:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> Input lag ResidentSleeper
[1:59:17] <SixthSun2> Equip a weapon NotLikeThis
[1:59:18] <POOPSinBED> Every console version of this game I have played has some technical problems.
[1:59:29] <%yeknomlive> @SixthSun2 he has the kunfu shoes on
[1:59:34] <$FuqBoiSlim> @sixthsun2 He has the kung fu shoes on
[1:59:35] <%UrsulaCat> FEET
[1:59:38] <worldbrand> I think the specular layer looks kinda...
[1:59:41] <Buzzard42> To be fair to the Switch
[1:59:49] <AxelCezar> "bad"
[1:59:50] <Prevot> switch version runs as bad as it looks
[1:59:51] <Buzzard42> it isn't an issue with the console, the port is just REALLY bad
[1:59:53] <%Promessa_EX> theres no way I would play this game at 30fps with lag
[1:59:53] <%UrsulaCat> de-equip shoes and shoe feet
[1:59:59] <%UrsulaCat> show feet I mean
[2:00:04] <+allups> worst graphics is what he means i think
[2:00:11] <RiceeFTW> tell Woolie to do fireball with the shoes
[2:00:16] <xdeathknightx> Minh proudly taking Pat's place as purveyor of controversial opinions Kappa
[2:00:16] <SomersaultJustice> did they try the rekka yet?
[2:00:22] <+Nobrev> 3d can look good too
[2:00:22] <$FuqBoiSlim> Fuck Ninty and Fuck the Shitch EleGiggle
[2:02:26] <Buzzard42> like, it's clearly rushed
[2:02:28] <AxelCezar> you soon willget a shitload of MP and MP max ups so chill
[2:02:35] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus you can use it in the air for extra distance on jumps
[2:02:36] <+BlueCenter77> use rekkas in the air to extend jump length
[2:02:45] <KessOrangeSoda> you could use the three kicks to effectively extend your jumps
[2:02:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Mana's hard to come by at first, but it's worth it then
[2:02:50] <sir_nack> there's a shit ton of breakable walls
[2:02:56] <tattleworm> there are kickable walls, roofs and floors
[2:02:58] <+SirPotsNPans> If you keep using the kicks, you can master the technique and use it with ANY other foot weapon
[2:03:00] <worldbrand> Hahaha... if only there was a breakable wall nearby.... ahaha...
[2:03:01] <+bigb00gi3> in the bottom right of that big room you were just in @WoolieVersus
[2:03:03] <%yeknomlive> the switch port was way later in the ks campaign though.
[2:03:06] <+SirPotsNPans> Otherwise only that one can do it
[2:03:08] <$FuqBoiSlim> AUUAHAUAAAH
[2:03:10] <GoldeNOVA> Castlevania also has fake ceiling and floors, so kick EVERYTHING
[2:03:12] <%Promessa_EX> you'll know when there's a wall
[2:03:13] <MayorRev> BAZ
[2:03:16] <MillaMoks> If he wants to see a breakable wall then there is one he has passed already
[2:03:18] <RiceeFTW> already missed 3 hggSleep
[2:03:19] <Buzzard42> in the state the Switch port is in
[2:03:24] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus there's fake walls, but also fakes floors and ceilings. enjoy!
[2:03:24] <SomersaultJustice> there's also fake ceilings and floors
[2:03:27] <Buzzard42> it isn't actually going to be out for like 3 months
[2:03:31] <Buzzard42> we got an Early Access dev build
[2:03:35] <MarylandJutsu> the STAHTE OUF EET
[2:03:35] <AxelCezar> tons and tons of secrets
[2:03:36] <wirblewomble> well that'a
[2:03:47] <wirblewomble> that's what messages are for in souls
[2:03:58] <BestTeaMaker> did woolie not even read that
[2:03:59] <RiceeFTW> woolie missed the tutorial hggOkay
[2:04:00] <$FuqBoiSlim> uhhhh
[2:04:01] <BestTeaMaker> LUL
[2:04:02] <AxelCezar> instructions literally on the screen boupheBrad boupheBrad
[2:04:07] <Laironx3> Aria of Sorrow had a soul ability that helped you find breakable walls.
[2:04:08] <Goraka91> FailFish
[2:04:08] <joylent_blue> tutorial being missed NotLikeThis
[2:04:10] <Prevot> of course Minh would like that

[2:04:14] <Buzzard42> wall on the right
[2:04:20] <RiceeFTW> LMFAOOOO
[2:04:22] <$FuqBoiSlim> Chat why would woolie do this
[2:04:25] <the_Deadpan_Man> you missed the tutorial
[2:04:30] <+allups> game bad now
[2:04:32] <+primax104> woolie's game is ruined XD
[2:04:36] <AxelCezar> blinder than Paige
[2:04:38] <Goraka91> So does Woolie know how to use his new ability?
[2:04:44] <sir_nack> i dont think he does
[2:04:50] <+ninebreaker6> no he doesnt
[2:04:50] <That_Mojo> he will figure it out
[2:04:53] <POOPSinBED> @buzzard42 The Xbox version still doesn’t have the day one patch yet. You can’t craft some endgame items because the item drop isn’t even in the game yet.
[2:05:01] <%Promessa_EX> there are plenty of abilities that show the walls
[2:05:01] <Buzzard42> what a joke LMAO
[2:05:05] <+allups> i get where he's coming from
[2:05:07] <%yeknomlive> dont tell him about the floor and ceiling ones
[2:05:12] <rosemon5001> back peddleing soo hard
[2:05:13] <worldbrand> I think about hitting them a lot, but I think it's because i grew up with castlevania
[2:05:14] <Prevot> it's a pretty bad gameplay mechanic
[2:05:23] <+primax104> breakable walls are a staple in 2d style games though
[2:05:28] <SomersaultJustice> so is the pc version the least borked version?
[2:05:35] <%yeknomlive> yeah
[2:05:39] <SixthSun2> LUL that enemy
[2:05:39] <That_Mojo> pc version worked
[2:05:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> PC version worked great
[2:05:56] <Goraka91> Know nothing about this game, was PC the first version?
[2:06:00] <%yeknomlive> @SomersaultJustice aside from my ps4 save getting corrupted it doesnt load as quickly. i dont have to worry about crashes on pc copy
[2:06:04] <+primax104> has woolie names the woolie vs conglomerate yet?
[2:06:10] <+primax104> *named
[2:06:10] <RiceeFTW> what's worse: breakable walls in Metroidvania games or those invisible walls in Dark Souls with a hidden bonfire?
[2:06:25] <ShinobiPhoenix> Castlevania 3, not 2
[2:06:25] <GoldeNOVA> The bonfire wall
[2:06:30] <GoldeNOVA> Castlevania has maps with percentages
[2:06:33] <+allups> @Goraka91 nah thy all released on the same time i think
[2:06:38] <GoldeNOVA> All you gotta do is search the area
[2:06:38] <Goraka91> AH
[2:06:41] <rosemon5001> will woolie ever find the tutorial find out next time
[2:06:44] <wirblewomble> That's not remotely a bad mechanic, it's an optional thing for people who want to put a little more time into exploration. As long as they're telegraphed well, which they usually are.
[2:06:44] <worldbrand> I dont mind either, to be honest, but i never found that wall bonfire next to artoria's crest on my own
[2:06:45] <%yeknomlive> all the breakable walls in this game are just bonuses not progression
[2:07:11] <Parapattern> I've always thought that the movement systems in Castlevania games feel way too stiff. That's just me, though.
[2:07:17] <RiceeFTW> when green barrels are the ones that explode hggBruh
[2:07:24] <Laironx3> Red means passion CurseLit
[2:07:35] <Prevot> LUL
[2:07:46] <wirblewomble> @parapattern that's only the nes games, the rest control pretty fluidly.
[2:07:46] <Goraka91> But does the crate explode?
[2:07:49] <+allups> LUL yeah it blows up and u fall in lust
[2:08:07] <GoldeNOVA> You heard it here first, TES games are garbage

[2:41:40] <fireking900> There is never one waifu
[2:41:44] <AxelCezar> Miriam is totally a waifu, a waifu that you can customize later
[2:41:45] <+REDtheBEAST> @WoolieVersus crafting is is a big part of this game if you want to get stronger better equips
[2:41:48] <RiceeFTW> yeah JOE hannes
[2:41:50] <+yoshkosh20> it's the baz mask that makes her waifu material.

[2:42:52] <grimwire1> i think it tells you what techinques you have once you used it once
[2:43:01] <%yeknomlive> @WoolieVersus certain tech is tied to specific weapons. you can master them to carry moves over
[2:43:02] <ShinobiPhoenix> Forward Forward Attack but with Nodechi until you train it

[2:45:13] <SomersaultJustice> baited
[2:45:16] <Prevot> fucking medusa head
[2:45:21] <+yoshkosh20> ok. kick minh out for that.
[2:45:23] <HitchhikingThrough> Hitstops that stop time are the best
[2:45:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I love the katanas in this game, they're a lot of fun to use
[2:45:34] <MillaMoks> @WoolieVersus Attack with the katana and then dont move and dont attack again for a moment and she will pose.
[2:45:40] <Laironx3> Parry that bird
[2:45:40] <sileo_patronus> Free combo
[2:45:52] <TigerClaws12> has woolie learned the korean dash?
[2:45:54] <SomersaultJustice> try forward back forward and 360s
[2:45:57] <+allups> o she has no feet
[2:46:01] <grimwire1> around the world motion ?
[2:46:05] <sileo_patronus> Half-back then forward?
[2:46:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus Quarter circle forward + Atk
[2:46:10] <%yeknomlive> 360
[2:46:12] <HitchhikingThrough> Do you reckon Devolver could make a smash game? I feel like they have enough shit to make one at this point.
[2:46:15] <RiceeFTW> 360 with spear
[2:46:21] <RiceeFTW> down+full circle
[2:46:34] <dan_g_v> dont you need. magic?
[2:46:42] <ShinobiPhoenix> Hadoken motion with Katana
[2:46:43] <Iamjustabox> Not every spear has every spear technique (until you master a tech by landing it enough, then every spear gets it)
[2:46:46] <+Proxzo> Hi Woolie!
[2:46:47] <Iamjustabox> Same with other weapon types
[2:46:57] <+Proxzo> gooey boy
[2:47:04] <+allups> i think woolie knows how to do a 360
[2:47:06] <%yeknomlive> this spear does have it though
[2:47:08] <custoadian> I think a lance is the first spear weapon with a tech
[2:47:09] <TigerClaws12> base spear has no technique
[2:47:12] <ShinobiPhoenix> It's not a full circle
[2:47:17] <+Swisstoast> if you master them then they do
[2:47:29] <Cowctus> every weapon of it's class will have the technique when said technique is mastered
[2:47:35] <AxelCezar> find the bookshelves and they tel you about techniques
[2:47:45] <+Stereotreme> katanas are super satisfying once you've mastered everything
[2:47:46] <+Fynale> has anyone told him about pressing down on the d pad while standing still
[2:47:47] <reonome> ROYAL GUARD
[2:47:48] <ShinobiPhoenix> It down to forward clockwise
[2:47:53] <+Stereotreme> they have so much utility
[2:47:57] <sileo_patronus> @WoolieVersus your Royal Guard is showing
[2:48:07] <%yeknomlive> @WoolieVersus you can read journals that will tell you moves to what weapons that gets recorded so you can check later
[2:48:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Parry makes the next boss pretty easy in my experience
[2:48:19] <ShinobiPhoenix> You can't parry projectiles
[2:48:19] <Iamjustabox> Do you mean pressing up? Pressing down just crouches, holding up is Fabulous
[2:48:19] <grimwire1> @WoolieVersus they show move list you test in the menu in the data area
[2:48:28] <+Fynale> there is a jojo pose you can do
[2:48:32] <MaximumSleep> you can pose while holding up if you're standing, but not sitting
[2:48:41] <%yeknomlive> there's a journal in this room
[2:48:43] <RiceeFTW> he did the dio pose
[2:48:44] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus you can't parry projectiles

[2:52:51] <%king_wragles> Fuck, did I miss the surprise stream?
[2:52:54] <ShinobiPhoenix> Shantae is so barely a Metroidvania and it isn't good enough to be compared
[2:52:59] <%mr_sups> @WoolieVersus Follow up question Minh, Reggie. Favorite Color?
[2:53:01] <presque> The dynamic of this trio is all over the place
[2:53:29] <RiceeFTW> Iga created a classic, Bloodstained is just a rehash of the classic
[2:53:35] <ShinobiPhoenix> There are better games that are also metros
[2:53:36] <RiceeFTW> which I don't mind
[2:53:49] <GoldeNOVA> Kojima created the stealth game, but he's not the best stealth game creator, not even close
[2:53:55] <RiceeFTW> sike
[2:53:57] <RiceeFTW> that's cap
[2:54:03] <BonzoBeanMachine> we need the true bayonetta killer
[2:54:18] <ShinobiPhoenix> @riceeftw people wanted Iga's style
[2:54:18] <Prevot> Metroid was always superior both before and after SotN anyway
[2:54:37] <GoldeNOVA> Hell naw
[2:54:47] <RiceeFTW> I still enjoy Bloodstained
[2:55:02] <%XzileGaming> im just glad we get so many variations and diversities, more amazing games for all of us
[2:55:02] <RiceeFTW> but not nearly as much as Symphony of the Night
[2:55:08] <Sonicdy> IEnjoy BloodStain
[2:55:22] <GoldeNOVA> I want a port of Order of Ecclesia
