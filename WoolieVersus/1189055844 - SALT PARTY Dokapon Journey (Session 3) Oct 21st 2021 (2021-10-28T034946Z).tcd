[0:01:38] <%RyTYoung> You guys seen that Monopoly Madness shit that got announced today? LUL
[0:01:41] <%thesickestzak> Risk is great. Just take over a continent and then stall everyone else out :)
[0:01:41] <%andrewofbob> Don't add house rules to Monopoly; they just make the win condition impossible
[0:01:42] <+Shishi1205> I think I mostly finished my games

[0:02:54] <Arqartur0> Risk the Gentleman's Game
[0:02:54] <emMmDeeKay> maybe this would be better for you guys on with one or two days between sessions
[0:02:59] <Deasmeister> Dice rolls will still fuck you
[0:03:04] <emMmDeeKay> at least
[0:03:15] <DanteReaver> I like the artstyle of this one.
[0:03:20] <user_naim> How many DSs got spiked because of this game?
[0:03:20] <Arqartur0> Woolie, play some Blood Bowl, it's like Risk but with two people
[0:03:26] <dds333a> @emmmdeekay they mentioned every Wed earlier, but who knows
[0:03:43] <Shwepie> @andrewofbob I was taught a bunch of house rules and never taught actual rules that speed up the game. Things like properties going up for auction if the first person landing there doesn't opt to buy it.

[0:56:31] <user_naim> truth
[0:56:34] <Qsmash_> soon Minh and Reggie will conspire against Woolie in an attempt to overthrow him
[0:56:36] <DSD24> is this a video game or a therapy session?
[0:57:05] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[0:57:07] <+bugz_munny> It's an exercise in trust

[0:57:10] <Asuterisuku> LUL
[0:57:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Don't mistake his weakness for kindness

[0:57:12] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[0:57:14] <%mr_sups> "Don't mistake my Weakness for Weakness"
[0:57:15] <%Takreth> It's dokapon so probably you need therapy afterwards

[1:06:27] <Chatterbox1991> The Woolie Hole is a meme for a reason :)
[1:06:29] <+mechslayer71> ain't that a sign of problem type 2?
[1:06:32] <WeiLiHeng> @setsuna_seiei Dokapon DX and The World probably would have been better picks to play despite being older, no?
[1:06:45] <turboyabo> nah thats old
[1:06:46] <+Shishi1205> MANkindknewtheycouldnotcahngesociety
[1:06:46] <+Setsuna_seiei> @lucaflowe Is it not on the series X BC list?
[1:06:53] <dds333a> they're closing in
[1:06:56] <glass_marcus> are those translated?

[1:07:10] <%xeromage> I like the thought process naration
[1:07:13] <+Setsuna_seiei> @weiliheng idk also consider that this is a remake of the first game. didn't look like they added much
[1:07:21] <+Setsuna_seiei> I'd have to see DX though
[1:07:26] <%Darmanimon> don't overthink it
[1:07:32] <turboyabo> woolie hyper thinking it
[1:07:35] <%livlinn> succinKewl
[1:07:47] <turboyabo> weakness to woolie is to make him over think it
[1:07:49] <user_naim> this is appropriate level of thought
[1:07:57] <WeiLiHeng> crap yeah, I don't think The World's been translated
[1:08:08] <turboyabo> so bascially overloading him
[1:08:24] <nukle0nik> hi woolie, for your DS emulator, please set it to integer scaling, nearest neighbour, that way it looks much better
[1:08:44] <%Nested_Dreams> What emulator?
[1:08:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:08:45] <%Darmanimon> wait why does Reggie have more money than Woolie but is second place? They're even the same level
[1:09:00] <turboyabo> so like he wont slip up right now but when he second guess him self later then be perfect time to strike
[1:09:00] <+pectusumbra> woolie's got more towns
[1:09:01] <+lucaflowe> reggies total worth is lower
[1:09:02] <%DashXero> Woolie will probably roll a 4.
[1:09:07] <%Darmanimon> ah ok, got it
[1:09:10] <topendbuzza> towns
[1:09:16] <MyNameIsRasus> @Darmanimon Reggie has more money on him, but since Woolz got more towns he has more net worth
[1:09:23] <%Darmanimon> didn't realize woolie was a man of net worth LUL
[1:10:19] <dds333a> all in all woolie is in good position
[1:10:45] <glumbaron> oh minh means go out and come back

[1:54:21] <+Jiggisnipe> Wtf'

[1:54:25] <+Setsuna_seiei> dorohedoro was actually really good on netflix
[1:54:25] <Solidnick18> minh is so nice

[1:54:42] <DSD24> Its a slingshot
[1:54:43] <Asuterisuku> That would probably be 4th place in a full game.
[1:54:44] <emptyantics> H*ck fire?!!
[1:54:48] <%xcompleasedad> @Setsuna_seiei The shit is FIRE.
[1:55:00] <Asuterisuku> Can't wait for S2.
[1:55:02] <%xcompleasedad> @Setsuna_seiei My actual favorite anime.
[1:55:08] <+hoenhime344> i... i think kingdom was a better designed game
[1:55:10] <dds333a> @shishi1205 yeah, they allow one to collect, but not to invest
[1:55:12] <viewtifulr> I <3 Hole
[1:55:14] <+Jiggisnipe> a Sonic spring Kappa
[1:55:16] <+Setsuna_seiei> @xcompleasedad dorohedoro is one of the FEW times Netflix CGI works
[1:55:20] <%ChoculaUltra> damn I want flan
[1:55:21] <+Setsuna_seiei> and that's rare
[1:55:22] <FlowLethal> this game is a im sorry for kingdom
[1:55:28] <+Shishi1205> Being a manga reader for Dorohedoro was a raw deal, I member waiting years
[1:55:31] <+mechslayer71> BOOBA WHO DIS
[1:55:32] <Asuterisuku> @hoenhime344 It's not like it came out ten years later or anything.
[1:55:34] <Xeno351> they would be trying to force you into darkling which would make sense if it wasn't trash
[1:55:47] <lotharrio> One Piece has taught me that springs and rubber bands are, indeed, opposites.
[1:55:52] <+Shishi1205> Its finished tho so go ahead and read the manga if you like it
[1:55:56] <dds333a> No, the Sonic one Kappa
[1:56:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Or maybe even six sets
[1:56:10] <+hoenhime344> @Asuterisuku this game came out after kingdom.
[1:56:11] <Alzero83> Eyes not clouded by Hatred
[1:56:11] <%mr_sups> 6 sets of eyes
[1:56:12] <+Setsuna_seiei> Kingdom doesn't deserve the Netflix treatment that imo needs a bigger more experienced anime studio
[1:56:16] <+Setsuna_seiei> so much potential
[1:56:17] <+akikyou> Six sets even
[1:56:18] <+pectusumbra> It's worth noting Dokapon Journey was NOT worked on by Sting
[1:56:23] <Asuterisuku> @hoenhime344 It's a remake of the original on SNES.
[1:56:37] <DSD24> I remember the "E" meme
[1:56:41] <+hoenhime344> @Asuterisuku ah

[1:56:57] <DSD24> I thought Dat Boi was cute
[1:56:58] <+hoenhime344> @Asuterisuku still... kingdom is FAR  better
[1:57:12] <Asuterisuku> Again, ten years of refinement will do that.

[2:26:50] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie has just been granted the win
[2:26:52] <%NickHatesSnow> This is way more brutal than Kingdom holy shit
[2:26:53] <+hoenhime344> if reggie dies he gets ported back. but minh is trapped
[2:26:53] <%Dapper_Cactuar> there is no escape only punishment
[2:26:53] <+Shishi1205> CAN'T ESCAPE FROM CROSSING FATE

[2:27:14] <%xcompleasedad> Woolie might get a winning lead with fucking NINETEEN DAYS
[2:27:14] <alroy909> woolie better use this time well...
[2:27:15] <TreeLeafBoi> Wooile does get to roam free though
[2:27:17] <turboyabo> that means woolie is free to do what ever he wants so min mess up
[2:27:19] <DanteReaver> Dokapon Dev team. We are not worthy of your genius.
[2:27:20] <dds333a> @x2eliah just two more maybe until it crumbles
[2:27:29] <andre11dr> But why is Minh hyper chasing Reggie tho?
[2:27:30] <user_naim> reggie could die to a monster and teleport out
[2:27:31] <+Jiggisnipe> should have took towns then
[2:27:32] <+hoenhime344> its FAR worse for minh. reggie can die and get out. minh is stuck
[2:27:33] <+paladinstarbuster> dont le wooolie get off again
[2:27:33] <+pectusumbra> depends on how long this story mode actually is
[2:27:43] <%DashXero> It's fucking Minh up because if he DOES get Reggie, it cuts down on his ability to get Woolie too.
[2:27:49] <andre11dr> It would've been better tu fuck Woolie up
[2:27:49] <randominternetsurfer> @hoenhime344 depending on how long Barrier lasts.
[2:27:56] <+pectusumbra> going down~
[2:27:59] <+crossing_mao> Targeted reggie’s colostomy bag
[2:28:00] <+pectusumbra> Let's get some content
[2:28:27] <%ekodrop> don't worry about it minh
[2:28:30] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh deserves this for not taking towns. It's not about crippling Woolie, he should cripple both of them at the same time
[2:28:32] <%livlinn> Hoooo boi joofbPop
[2:28:39] <+terry_quest> go deeper
[2:28:44] <+Jiggisnipe> do it
[2:28:52] <Solidnick18> try it
[2:28:54] <+pectusumbra> Also let it be noted again that this game is not by Sting. Dokapon is a SPIRIT UNTO ITSELF
[2:28:55] <MyNameIsRasus> That looks like a battle space to me
[2:28:59] <+Jiggisnipe> go back outside
[2:29:01] <Solidnick18> WHO KNOWS
[2:29:10] <+Damie904> Minh kinda deserves this for beelining to Reggie. Woolie's gonna prosper super hard by being isolated.
[2:29:20] <X2Eliah> Imagine if reggie dies to a map monster
[2:29:26] <Alzero83> Woolie has the world to himself atm
[2:29:34] <dds333a> Deeper underground

[2:30:04] <+Jiggisnipe> he's no longer Kill Reggy tho Kappa
[2:30:12] <dds333a> @hoenhime344 was LUL the name change Kappa
[2:30:16] <+mechslayer71> so they're just stuck in the cave right?
[2:30:17] <+terry_quest> minh fucked himself again
[2:30:21] <+hoenhime344> you can change your name, but you cant change your soul
[2:30:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Minh brought this entirely on himself
[2:30:25] <turboyabo> reggie with the peace signs
[2:30:26] <OldManDeckardCain> CHASE intensifies
[2:30:26] <+RaveBV> Reggie's like "Woolie, the fuck?"

[2:30:32] <dds333a> @hoenhime344 LUL LUL LUL

[2:30:47] <+paladinstarbuster> reggie should just bite it to a monster
[2:30:52] <+Damie904> @pectusumbra He cant. Hell Reggie might find a magic shop with a teleport spell. Minh's fucked.

[2:31:30] <Solidnick18> meanwhile...
[2:31:35] <dds333a> @andre11dr honestly, not hard confirmed
[2:31:38] <+Jiggisnipe> 21 days is enough to reset every town
[2:31:39] <DigiDom> Meanwhile Woolie is playing a single player rpg
[2:31:43] <turboyabo> every one gonna come back to a shonen jump time jump arc
[2:31:44] <dds333a> most likely, but seriously
[2:31:45] <+Shishi1205> Blue chest
[2:31:47] <andre11dr> Cause if not ,then I'd hunt Woolie right now
[2:31:48] <DanteReaver> In Kingdom the blocks cant be walked through by the Darkling
[2:31:48] <FlowLethal> woolie dominate game easy
[2:31:57] <Alzero83> the Monster used a barrier
[2:31:58] <+hoenhime344> no it was the king
[2:32:01] <+hoenhime344> ooooo
[2:32:12] <+hoenhime344> i thought it said the king did it
[2:32:12] <JetpackMcQuack> Reggie was his bait 4Head
[2:32:13] <+Jiggisnipe> chest tho
[2:32:21] <+pectusumbra> what are green chests?
[2:32:31] <DanteReaver> The King was saying that a roadblock appeared
[2:32:36] <DanteReaver> not that he did it
[2:32:42] <+Jiggisnipe> need lockpicks to open green chests, probably have really good items
[2:32:48] <dds333a> oooooh, gonna get sonething good
[2:33:00] <+pectusumbra> They are not ALL connected
[2:33:01] <Solidnick18> yeah that is split
[2:33:02] <andre11dr> Oh boy no looping means it's hard to fight him
[2:33:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Green chests have the good shit on them right
[2:33:12] <X2Eliah> Reggie can kite
[2:33:15] <+hoenhime344> its likie darksouls game design Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:33:17] <%DashXero> Trapped.
[2:33:20] <andre11dr> This seems like a waste of a Darkling to more it goes
[2:33:23] <+pectusumbra> reggie has one safe turn now, so 2 turns to land on a chest
[2:33:50] <+pectusumbra> @andre11dr Minh gave himself over to spite
[2:33:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:33:52] <%fetrigon> Reggie has won! biggly ye! KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:34:04] <andre11dr> Like this is to much effort for to little, he was better off taking towns
[2:34:09] <+terry_quest> could have used the 6 gem
[2:34:14] <dds333a> they are the stabilizer LUL
[2:34:19] <turboyabo> i wouldnt start cheering just yet for reggie
[2:34:27] <+pectusumbra> don't go up yet
[2:34:36] <Someguy893> The greed
[2:34:40] <MyNameIsRasus> Minh won't be able to attack you this turn anyway
[2:34:42] <JetpackMcQuack> amateurs see loops, professionals see attack angles
[2:34:44] <turboyabo> that french words means there still reason to fear
[2:34:48] <+Damie904> Reggie does have revive, so he can survive a fight
[2:35:00] <+Ricky_Rexx> Remember kids, greedy plays always get rewarded
[2:35:09] <X2Eliah> maaaaath
[2:35:11] <+pectusumbra> @Someguy893 it's actually right. Minh has to spend at least 1 turn getting down to Reggie's level. Meaning reggie has an extra turn to either grab a chest or get out
[2:35:13] <+hoenhime344> no risk. no reward
[2:35:14] <andre11dr> Reggie is second too ,why the chase ?
[2:35:25] <+hoenhime344> because reghgie hasnt begged
[2:35:25] <andre11dr> Woolie is way stronger

[2:37:07] <+terry_quest> monkaS
[2:37:08] <FlowLethal> reggie had to fight
[2:37:09] <Asuterisuku> Saa, KOI
[2:37:09] <%saladin1911> Meanwhile, Woolie is just outside enjoying the peaceful, beautiful scenery. Birds are singings and the sun is shining upon him. Not a danger in sight csbeastMember
[2:37:12] <+pectusumbra> alright, he got to the other side
[2:37:14] <Solidnick18> save
[2:37:16] <+Shishi1205> 14 days left
[2:37:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Ricky_Rexx darkling
[2:37:31] <+Ricky_Rexx> @Ricky_Rexx ah
[2:37:33] <+pectusumbra> it's another anime chase arc in DOKAPON BABY
[2:37:33] <+hoenhime344> didnt minh get caught in a cave when darkling in kingdom???
[2:37:34] <Wydamn> A land where monsters rule
[2:37:36] <MysticMismagius13> with that said, kicks could always just surrender to the monster for a free safe turn
[2:37:44] <andre11dr> Meanwhile Woolie is going beyond and farther
[2:38:03] <%DashXero> What's the penalty for getting KO'd by a monster?
[2:38:08] <Arqartur0> So that cave is wu tan?
[2:38:10] <+pectusumbra> @hoenhime344 Minh put a death curse on woolie in dokapon and ran into a cave to keep him from breaking the curse, with reggie fucking woolie over at the last minute
[2:38:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie may get such a lead here that it becomes virtually impossible for a comeback
[2:38:18] <+Ricky_Rexx> Woolie could just get up and leave and he'd still probably win
[2:38:21] <dds333a> @hoenhime344 don't think DarkMinh happend in Kigdom
[2:38:30] <andre11dr> @dashxero Lose money item or weapon
[2:38:34] <Alzero83> if reggie dies tho, Minh is still sealed in the cave forever
[2:38:36] <Alzero83> Kappa
[2:38:37] <%DashXero> Ah.
[2:38:42] <+pectusumbra> @MyNameIsRasus I honestly doubt it. These games almost always have end of game bullshit
[2:38:43] <MysticMismagius13> @MyNameIsRasus well it is chapter 3, someone could just go darkling again and then not chase 2nd place into a cave
[2:38:43] <+undersea_magic> yeah, this is free for woolie
[2:38:46] <randominternetsurfer> Woolie, don't waste time and get some towns
[2:38:50] <Arqartur0> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:38:58] <+lucaflowe> it's free for woolie but he's scared and gunning for vanish

[2:58:17] <+Setsuna_seiei> sunken cost fallacy Minh is eating darkling
[2:58:17] <NoviceArtist4090> Only one week passed
[2:58:19] <+Damie904> Minh wasted a 3 week darkling run to chase Reggie into a map with no loops. He's gonna waste Darkling, maybe kill Reggie. And get it again right after.
[2:58:22] <alroy909> the best part is that reggie is actually getting levels and super good stuff while being chased non stop
[2:58:27] <lotharrio> Sunk costs, let's gooooo!

[3:01:53] <+Grayhammatter> one off
[3:01:58] <Make_me_mad> This is just a sad use of the darkling power.
[3:02:00] <+Jcheats> One off, what an incredibly close roll
[3:02:00] <+terry_quest> at this point die and minh will be stuck in here
[3:02:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> proably best to stay close as possible to reggie
[3:02:06] <%thesw1tch> what a waste of darkling
[3:02:20] <+Ricky_Rexx> he took all damage
[3:02:21] <+Shady_Zaku> goddamn
[3:02:21] <hadwinmanwinsanwinjunwin> Firetail did more than Darkling Minh after almost 2 weeks of single minded chase
[3:02:25] <andre11dr> Is it safe to say that this was the worst Darkling play ever?
[3:02:29] <+Shishi1205> Muskrat
[3:02:30] <+Rekinsinn> firetail
[3:02:32] <+Shady_Zaku> Sandworm
[3:02:36] <%andrewofbob> A salamander?
[3:02:39] <+pectusumbra> Reggie could also just give up and get safety a turn that way
[3:02:40] <%smallboops> it wasnt even a bad play
[3:02:43] <%mr_sups> "Come and get your dinner"
[3:02:44] <%xcompleasedad> @andre11dr Presumably, a child once had a worse turn
[3:02:44] <+pectusumbra> looks like some baby dragon or something
[3:02:46] <user_naim> @andre11dr until the next one
[3:02:49] <%smallboops> reggie is literally getting plot armored
[3:02:49] <+Ricky_Rexx> Man had two weeks to accomplish nothing
[3:02:51] <+terry_quest> what is woolie even doing at this point?
[3:02:51] <viewtifulr> not only that but his heckfire did what 222 something while the foe has 241
[3:02:58] <turboyabo> he saw reggie level 17 but ignore woolie profits
[3:03:04] <+Jiggisnipe> if Reggie dies lol

[3:03:36] <Visorak6> WHY?
[3:03:37] <+Jiggisnipe> you only lose gold from dying I think lol
[3:03:38] <glumbaron> only lost like 1/4 money
[3:03:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie, dying would have been better
[3:03:39] <%thesw1tch> terrible move lol
[3:03:41] <+hoenhime344> so now minh cant fight him
[3:03:42] <+pectusumbra> this is a reasonable play
[3:03:45] <+terry_quest> NotLikeThis what is this madness
[3:03:48] <+pectusumbra> reggie's GEAR is valuable
[3:03:50] <andre11dr> So the chase was for NOTHING YEEEEY
[3:03:59] <+hoenhime344> this was a BAD idea to get in the cave
[3:04:05] <+Ricky_Rexx> Copium
[3:04:06] <viewtifulr> the chase was always for nothing
[3:04:08] <+Grayhammatter> yay, nothing chase
[3:04:09] <dds333a> @jiggisnipe you can lose worse, but yeah
[3:04:13] <%smallboops> you can see their faces hearing that like "shit"
[3:04:15] <turboyabo> noooooo i mean his safe now but i think if reggie runs into a monster and surreneders his good
[3:04:16] <+Jiggisnipe> yea it's better to stay outside
[3:04:16] <MyNameIsRasus> The best 21 turns ever
[3:04:18] <+hoenhime344> wasted content
[3:04:24] <+Jiggisnipe> chests, towns, some many safe spots
[3:04:26] <%saladin1911> Minh is gonna lose Darkling in the cave, then immediately die in the cave LUL
[3:04:27] <user_naim> ”I’ll fucken do it again”
[3:04:35] <WeiLiHeng> Should be playing a recorder version of Chase rn
[3:04:42] <+Ricky_Rexx> for two weeks
[3:04:44] <dds333a> LUL
[3:04:47] <+Rekinsinn> imagine being woolie and having 21 turns to play a single-player rpg
[3:04:51] <andre11dr> For real, this hole Darkling turn was like a filler arc
[3:04:51] <+MidnightDeacon> but then you get bit by a snake

[3:09:58] <user_naim> Nice of him to do this AFTER TWO WEEKS
[3:10:01] <FlowLethal> darkling isnt worth anything in this game
[3:10:06] <Make_me_mad> The devil is just shaking his head. He gave this guy evil powers to raise hell and he spent the whole time languishing in a cave.

[3:11:40] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie played that perfetly too Woolie come on
[3:11:49] <+pectusumbra> Let's be real, it's entirely Minh's fault. He actively threw his advantage
[3:11:55] <dds333a> That was planning, and luck LUL
[3:11:55] <+paladinstarbuster> Reggie is the protagonist win or lose
[3:12:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> I don't need to be lucky, I just need you to not be lucky
[3:12:04] <GeoGio3> Reggie gonna get his ass beat at dark souls
[3:12:06] <dds333a> @pectusumbra but yeah, that was more the opposition
[3:12:06] <+Jiggisnipe> @MyNameIsRasus he did, the only thing he could have done was die a little earlier

[3:12:22] <%fetrigon> Reggie. Wins. B I G G L Y!
[3:12:22] <turboyabo> like reggie did lose some items , and money but he didnt lose much
[3:12:23] <+Setsuna_seiei> @mynameisrasus he should've used magic to delay safe spacez and missplayed it hard
[3:12:29] <+Jiggisnipe> #TeamReggie
[3:12:33] <JetpackMcQuack> king of footsies
[3:12:35] <+Shishi1205> He did lose the revival

[3:12:41] <notgarza> #TeamReggie
[3:12:42] <+Vigonept> suprise protagonist
[3:12:42] <+pectusumbra> The thing is if you have Money AND Gear in this game you can come back
[3:12:45] <glass_marcus> It had a greater chance of escaping next turn
[3:12:45] <DigiDom> protag luck LUL
[3:12:51] <andre11dr> Reggie totally had plot armour today
[3:12:51] <turboyabo> woolie wanted reggie to get got #TeamReggie
[3:12:52] <viewtifulr> saving those spells to dump it all on someone
[3:13:00] <+Grayhammatter> time to kill woolie reggie
[3:13:02] <+hoenhime344> in-ev-ate-able
[3:13:05] <+eanscrale> Reggie had Perseverance and Luck, PLUCK
[3:13:20] <+Setsuna_seiei> that was a stupid play
[3:13:24] <%smallboops> LUCK AND PLUCK
[3:13:30] <%MajorCrasher> darkling having come here in Kingdom is so much better
[3:13:31] <+Shady_Zaku> yeye sword of pluck loot
[3:13:32] <%NickHatesSnow> I'm still rooting for Minh
[3:13:33] <+Shady_Zaku> lol
[3:13:34] <+Jiggisnipe> naw
[3:13:36] <dds333a> @eanscrale it became his pride, and will be his future!
[3:13:42] <+Setsuna_seiei> there's a 0% he fights you on on a treasure space
[3:13:45] <+pectusumbra> naw. Hard numbers are WAY better
[3:13:46] <+hoenhime344> Minh is my dokkage. i still worship him
[3:13:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> 4 days left of Darkling time, use it wisely
[3:13:51] <+Jiggisnipe> the cave was blocked intially
[3:14:07] <+pectusumbra> Minh is absolutely the 3rd dokage and deserves to get washed
[3:14:15] <andre11dr> I still think going after Reggie in the cave was bad to begin with
[3:14:17] <+terry_quest> he got a dope shield though
[3:14:19] <+Jiggisnipe> multiple spinners won't necessarily work, Minh could never tough Reggie with 5 spinners
[3:14:23] <%DashXero> Can Dark Minh get out of this cave to make a difference?
[3:14:30] <andre11dr> Should've gone after Woolie, his in 1st
[3:14:37] <dds333a> @dashxero not in time
[3:14:41] <+Jiggisnipe> nope
[3:14:43] <+undersea_magic> nah, minh's donezo
[3:14:47] <+Shishi1205> rip
[3:14:49] <+pectusumbra> it would be perfect if minh was trapped in here and died
[3:14:50] <randominternetsurfer> @andre11dr But he ultimately won more levels at making him a serious threat to woolie.
[3:14:52] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:14:54] <+Jiggisnipe> oof
[3:15:00] <X2Eliah> can steal
[3:15:11] <MyNameIsRasus> At level 11? Against those gorgons?
[3:15:14] <+Jiggisnipe> should reset every town
[3:15:27] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:15:31] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh is level 11 and doesn't have the best gear
[3:15:33] <%smallboops> yeah imo chilling on overworld and eating towns was the play
[3:15:33] <+Shishi1205> yeah dont
[3:15:38] <+Shady_Zaku> !uptime
[3:15:38] <@Moobot> @Shady_Zaku WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 26 minutes
[3:15:40] <Zedkan> first time dokapon viewer, how big of a lead is this for Woolie?
[3:15:48] <%smallboops> massive
[3:15:50] <%NickHatesSnow> lv 11, that means strike baby
[3:15:50] <+Setsuna_seiei> giant
[3:15:51] <dds333a> @zedkan significant
[3:15:52] <+MrTurtleThief> eat it tho
[3:15:53] <emMmDeeKay> Not much
[3:15:53] <+Jiggisnipe> and we livin
[3:15:55] <X2Eliah> girthy
[3:15:56] <andre11dr> Really big
[3:15:57] <bevyrage> EAT THE SHIT! i ain't sayin' i've ever did it, but i'm sayin' EAT THE SHIT
[3:15:58] <+Grayhammatter> a massive lead
[3:15:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:15:59] <MyNameIsRasus> WITH 120 DEF
[3:16:01] <+Shishi1205> @Zedkan significant but not imposible
[3:16:03] <+Setsuna_seiei> this is t kingdom so it's gonna be alot harder to catch-up
[3:16:04] <+Jiggisnipe> with BIG DEFENSE
[3:16:06] <X2Eliah> yooo
[3:16:07] <bevyrage> read it in a magazine
[3:16:08] <andre11dr> But the tables can still turn
[3:16:09] <X2Eliah> 120 def??
[3:16:11] <BurdRightsActivist> RESSURECTION
[3:16:11] <%DashXero> Kicks is back. Tell a friend.
[3:16:12] <Zedkan> gotcha. thanks guys!
[3:16:12] <user_naim> I wonder if minh still has a chance to take enough towns from woolz
[3:16:13] <dds333a> Chapter quests and another Darkling could upset Woolie tho
[3:16:17] <+Setsuna_seiei> if Minh keeps focusing Reggie Willie is gonna wash both of them
[3:16:19] <+Shishi1205> @X2Eliah The buff persists
[3:16:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Get some towns Reg
[3:16:22] <GeoGio3> Minh copuld have obliterated that lead with the darkling
[3:16:23] <randominternetsurfer> SAMURAI KICKS
[3:16:27] <+Shishi1205> I mean the maiden shield
[3:16:30] <dds333a> also field events could shave off his money
[3:16:34] <+pectusumbra> that magic space
[3:16:34] <%xcompleasedad> @X2Eliah He got an item that was 20 levels higher than his current level
[3:16:35] <%smallboops> it does need to be said that, you are never safely ahead in dokapon
[3:16:38] <+Ricky_Rexx> Kicks breating in that fresh overworld air
[3:16:40] <+Jiggisnipe> so if this Darkling works they way we think, you get enough days to reset most things
[3:16:50] <+Jiggisnipe> so he can catch up
[3:16:54] <%xcompleasedad> @Jiggisnipe And he reset nothing LUL
[3:17:00] <+Setsuna_seiei> @jiggisnipe Woolie has hard cash
[3:17:03] <+pectusumbra> yeah if you actually USE darkling you can catch up. Minh just wasted it on his spite
[3:17:06] <+Setsuna_seiei> and he could vanish
[3:17:09] <X2Eliah> Kinks is mad strong and highest level
[3:17:27] <BurdRightsActivist> @X2Eliah Kinks LUL
[3:17:30] <dds333a> @smallboops exactly
[3:17:39] <andre11dr> Like now he has to wait for the bat and get the right rolls to land on the thing, while Woolie is making hype bucks when he was already winning
[3:17:40] <Puhff> what the puck
[3:17:45] <+Jiggisnipe> idk if Minh can fight these enemies lol
[3:17:48] <%DashXero> Man. That's sad to see.
[3:17:49] <+undersea_magic> minh's thrown away every chance at a comeback he's had the past 2 sessions.. things look bleak
[3:17:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Minh has made the worst call at every step of the way
[3:17:56] <+Setsuna_seiei> Minh Is gonna die in that cave
[3:18:00] <+undersea_magic> he's going senile
[3:18:12] <+Grayhammatter> gonna die in that cave
[3:18:17] <+Shady_Zaku> train is VERY generous dude you gon DIIIE
[3:18:17] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[3:18:30] <+pectusumbra> Again, reggie doing one thing to him in session one put him on tilt since. Same thing with Reggie beating woolie who then extended the session yesterday for salt :p
[3:18:30] <+Setsuna_seiei> bro he could die andkse the weapon
[3:18:33] <X2Eliah> Minh didnt lose weapons from darklinging?
[3:18:36] <andre11dr> Minh definitely has had some really questionable decisions this LP
[3:18:43] <%smallboops> can he survive? smash cut to minhce meat
[3:18:44] <%DashXero> Can he not get one-shotted, though?
[3:18:55] <+Setsuna_seiei> if Minh loses his weapon again he's completely fucked for the rest of this session
[3:18:57] <andre11dr> Especially that surrender last session
[3:19:09] <andre11dr> That was just something else
[3:19:13] <dds333a> @x2eliah that's one of the few things you don't lose yeah
[3:19:20] <X2Eliah> odd
[3:19:21] <%MajorCrasher> the surrender was a mistake
[3:19:35] <%MajorCrasher> because he misread the hp
[3:19:39] <%smallboops> classic minh
[3:19:48] <andre11dr> The past 30 minutes felt like a mistake
[3:20:08] <%smallboops> past 30 mins was an exercise in sunken cost fallacy :V
[3:20:08] <user_naim> Better revenge lesson than TLOU2
[3:20:14] <NoviceArtist4090> Reggie is so lucky
[3:20:19] <dds333a> Woolz bettter get investing LUL
[3:20:20] <randominternetsurfer> @user_naim Tru
[3:20:32] <user_naim> Yara and Lev were cool though, and the dodge button was sick
[3:20:33] <+pectusumbra> All that said, I look forward to the legends of KICKS, imagine that in anime/manga form
[3:20:33] <randominternetsurfer> Preparation.
[3:20:35] <+Setsuna_seiei> @smallboops Reggie for sure got lucky, but Minh played it really bad
[3:20:41] <+Grayhammatter> that luck was astonishing
[3:20:42] <%smallboops> it was a perfect storm
[3:20:49] <%smallboops> fr fr
[3:20:52] <dds333a> @pectusumbra SeemsGood
[3:20:53] <GeoGio3> So does minh not have a weapon again?
[3:21:01] <%smallboops> he should still have wep
[3:21:05] <dds333a> @geogio3 no, he keeps it
[3:21:11] <+pectusumbra> again, it's not all luck. Darkling is way weaker in this game without the darkling point stuff
[3:21:20] <dds333a> Darkling at least doesn't remove weapons
[3:21:27] <%xcompleasedad> Chase arc was very good, villain played the role perfectly, 10/10
[3:21:29] <GeoGio3> @dds333a true, last time reggie stole it. thx
[3:21:35] <+Setsuna_seiei> @pectusumbra  he could've taken towns, and gunned for woolie this entire time
[3:21:38] <Alzero83> Minhs hate boner cost him
[3:21:39] <dds333a> sure thing
[3:22:01] <+Setsuna_seiei> then dropped Willie to second place, and gunned after Reggie afterwards
[3:22:04] <+pectusumbra> absolutely. Minh made a mistake from the start, just that Reggie took the right calculated risks
[3:22:04] <%smallboops> hard agree, towns was the play. although i dont blame him for the chase
[3:22:19] <%MajorCrasher> honestly I'm chalking the chase up to content at this point. it was pretty entertaining imo
[3:22:30] <+Setsuna_seiei> @smallboops also towns for the xp from killing the monster once darkling was done
[3:22:42] <dds333a> That does remind me, man, with the right RNG on Darkling points, you could DECIMATE the field LUL
[3:22:51] <%MajorCrasher> darkling doesn't seem to give xp in this game
[3:23:04] <dds333a> either that, or it's staggered xp
[3:23:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1450691523826397185?t=GJ8TAA1brJjBklhWx9BKSg&s=19
[3:23:07] <X2Eliah> @MajorCrasher no? oh thats gonna suck for minh
[3:23:09] <+Setsuna_seiei> @majorcrasher from killing monsters not from a catch-up bonus
[3:23:16] <%MajorCrasher> oh ok
[3:23:25] <Arqartur0> So basically Reggie’s playing the Queen’s Gambit?
[3:23:28] <andre11dr> @dds333a If you got enough points as Darkling in Kingdom you could literally take everything
[3:23:33] <+Setsuna_seiei> could recapture and grind like that
[3:23:37] <+Shady_Zaku> GOGO
[3:23:39] <dds333a> either way, Minh got no exp his turn anyway
[3:23:40] <%smallboops> MINH WHY

[3:23:47] <MyNameIsRasus> Minh come on dude

[3:23:58] <MyRattata> the things will kill

[3:24:25] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[3:24:31] <+pectusumbra> damn
[3:24:34] <andre11dr> This just keeps getting worse and worse for Minh
[3:24:36] <alroy909> minh is just giving up at the game I guess, he's gonna die in the cave
[3:24:38] <%thesw1tch> so, like, minhs turns are honestly boring
[3:24:38] <dds333a> Seed just roots the town
[3:24:43] <+Setsuna_seiei> bro if Minh dies and the monster tosses his weapon hes done for awhile
[3:24:56] <+pectusumbra> Minh did this to himself. To be fair him grinding on the first level could be just what he needs, mentally
[3:25:02] <%smallboops> hes actually out of the game until he gets darkling again
[3:25:21] <+Jiggisnipe> I'm not sure if he can grind, Reggie's weapon is alot better than his I think
[3:25:27] <andre11dr> If the monster takes his weapon, Minh might just straight be done
[3:25:27] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:25:31] <dds333a> @majorcrasher definitely content, yeah LUL
[3:25:40] <%DashXero> It was diarrhea.

[3:35:12] <MyNameIsRasus> the sunkest cost
[3:35:15] <Make_me_mad> Minh drilled a hole in the bottom of the barrel and has started to dig deeper.
[3:35:16] <+pectusumbra> to be fair if minh wins even one fight there he'll probably get like 2 levels easy
[3:35:18] <user_naim> I mean I’ve wasted 21 days before.
[3:35:24] <+Grayhammatter> the most sunk of costs
[3:35:25] <%smallboops> at this point i want minh to lose the weapon, he must suffer his mistakes
[3:35:25] <andre11dr> LUL
[3:35:42] <+Jiggisnipe> omg imagine if it rust him
[3:35:43] <andre11dr> Minh deserves to lose his weapon
[3:35:48] <dds333a> @glumbaron upon countering a mmagical attack, you swap current hp with the opponent
[3:35:52] <%DashXero> Minh was blinded by vengeance.
[3:35:55] <andre11dr> He wasted everyone time
[3:35:57] <MyNameIsRasus> The cost is now reaching the Mariana Trenches
[3:36:01] <+pectusumbra> If Minh picked spy at the start of the game
[3:36:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait hold on how is woolie lower level than reggie
[3:36:15] <glumbaron> reggie got to fight bigger monsters
[3:36:17] <+Grayhammatter> reggie got gains in the lava cave
[3:36:19] <X2Eliah> reggie got good exp in cave
[3:36:20] <glass_marcus> training arc
[3:36:21] <glumbaron> woolie did fewer fights
[3:36:25] <glumbaron> and smaller ones
[3:36:26] <+Jiggisnipe> Minh's probably gonna use swap if he wins initiative

[4:44:29] <DXLelouch24> @pectusumbra nopr in Kingdom Mage was male but in Journey their female
[4:44:33] <DXLelouch24> nope*
[4:44:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> medua woolieGASM_BW
[4:44:34] <andre11dr> Ok ,time to robb Reggie
[4:44:37] <%MajorCrasher> it's 10k

[4:44:58] <+lootfiendxxi> sodium levels rising lol
[4:44:59] <+Grayhammatter> reggie needs to start investing
[4:45:00] <Landedx> Woolie thinking now is a good time to take back the money Reggie borrowed with intrest
[4:45:05] <+RemedyofRevenge> around the world in 90 days nohit%
[4:45:09] <%emperordread> "Adventurers! I need you to do some bullshit!"
[4:45:15] <brunoberserk> lord of the SALT
[4:45:18] <+paladinstarbuster> woolie loves the voice
[4:45:19] <+pectusumbra> @DXLelouch24 there's male and female versions of each class in this game.
[4:45:24] <dds333a> it could get wild, and boy, if this game has some final boss shit, can't wait
[4:45:37] <user_naim> The fact Woolie’s King voice is accepted as canon in my head makes that joke land amazingly well
[4:45:38] <DXLelouch24> it better have some final boss shit
[4:45:41] <+Setsuna_seiei> @pectusumbra it's not make and female versions, they have different abilities
[4:45:52] <+pectusumbra> Fighter and Amazon, Mage and Witch, Bandit and Spy, Paladin and Valkarie
[4:45:54] <MrATheGreat> YES
[4:45:55] <+pectusumbra> ther'es a clear theme
[4:46:00] <Solidnick18> just random lamp
[4:46:25] <+Setsuna_seiei> again it looks like male and female swaps, but it's not. they're actual different classes with different abilities
[4:46:32] <MrATheGreat> Tbf Minh’s approaching crit health
[4:46:37] <dds333a> to adapt to this game yeah LUL
[4:46:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> strats are being developed
[4:46:54] <+Grayhammatter> reggie is chaos
[4:47:02] <brunoberserk> KILL CHAOS
[4:47:02] <+RemedyofRevenge> is this game only enjoyable to play with friends (despite the salt) or can you even play this game solo?
[4:47:06] <dds333a> With the differences between thus and kingdom
[4:47:21] <randominternetsurfer> @remedyofrevenge I mean, is mario party fun solo?
[4:47:23] <+Shishi1205> @RemedyofRevenge I played this one a bit solo, kingdom is better IMO
[4:47:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> @remedyofrevenge AI cheats so probably not
[4:47:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Choose violence woolie
[4:47:25] <+pectusumbra> @Setsuna_seiei Yes, I understand that. We were just talking about character gender
[4:47:26] <dds333a> @remedyofrevenge I've heard that playing with ai is unfun
[4:47:35] <+Grayhammatter> on all 80G
[4:47:35] <andre11dr> It's Dokapon, Chaos always wins

[4:47:37] <+RemedyofRevenge> Ah okay, I thought as much
[4:47:41] <+pectusumbra> @dds333a It really sucks in Kingdom, from experience
[4:47:49] <+Shishi1205> Playing solo means you can savescumm tho
[4:47:54] <dds333a> @pectusumbra I believe it
[4:48:00] <+Setsuna_seiei> @dds333a I'm so mad now that The world isn't translsted
[4:48:11] <+Setsuna_seiei> because that's the direct improvement to kingdom
[4:48:12] <MrATheGreat> Woolie peed on the bed before leaving. It’s said Yellow.
[4:48:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> @shishi1205 agreed but that gets old and ruins the sense of accomplishment for me
[4:48:53] <+Shishi1205> @Th3SmartAlec I mean, the AI super cheats when they get darkling so no compassion from me
[4:49:12] <+Shishi1205> Input reading bastards
[4:49:18] <+pectusumbra> Also save scumming dokapon story mode makes it EVEN LONGER
[4:49:22] <+Grayhammatter> schmovement

[5:07:04] <MrATheGreat> That’s kinda trash
[5:07:05] <+terry_quest> be*
[5:07:05] <+Setsuna_seiei> it reduces the damage then seals it
[5:07:13] <+pectusumbra> unless the enemy is VERY lopsideded and having no magic just screws them
[5:07:14] <+Setsuna_seiei> so it's actually really good
[5:07:23] <randominternetsurfer> If Woolie uses Gather now, Minh can't use his magic, right?
[5:07:25] <+paladinstarbuster> if you tank you deny more shots
