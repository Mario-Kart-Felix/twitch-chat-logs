[0:19:58] <Josef_Stryker> I'm personally really happy with the 6P changes for Potemkin. Even if it means Garuda got a nerf
[0:20:21] <andre11dr> Also Nago dosen't have a reversal
[0:20:22] <Josef_Stryker> 6P counterhit into Heavenly Potemkin Buster Kreygasm
[0:20:25] <+Tragosavich> Anji's Kou is the best fly swatter against Milia

[0:22:35] <Josef_Stryker> Injustice 3 got revealed?
[0:22:40] <OldManDeckardCain> may was already overvalued and now they trashed her and at the same time omega buffed ram LUL
[0:22:41] <%Feralspirit41> Who plays fighting games to THINK?

[0:22:53] <lonosis47> at dc fandome
[0:23:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Cheer500 Leffen does not speak for the Eastern Chipp Kingdom! We are a humble fiefdom with our /balanced/ Alpha Blades and actual tech!

[0:24:25] <andre11dr> But Milia also dies that fast
[0:24:26] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Josef_Stryker It's a 10-0 match up for both players.
[0:24:35] <%ken_kuma> How is everyone? Glad I could finally catch a stream.

[0:25:01] <Shad0wTag> @yousayyugi that a hilarious to suggest
[0:25:04] <andre11dr> Sol with bar can actually TOD Milia
[0:25:17] <%ultimatetotoro> as if you play granblue fantasy versus *shudders*
[0:25:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:25:56] <Josef_Stryker> I love when game devs can think of a clever way to buff/nerf like when they 'removed' Dan's infinite but gave his fireball a chance to fire off a better Gadoken
[0:25:57] <%jinking79> Dust launcher Millia twice to kill her LUL

[2:02:52] <+Basker17> Why do they look like Fate characters?
[2:03:09] <boti_balint> Same artist/writer
[2:03:35] <dds333a> albeit not the original artist LUL
[2:03:46] <andre11dr> Fate comes from Melty or some shit
[2:04:09] <+eanscrale> well it sure does look like Takeuchi.
[2:04:29] <%townzzzzz> oooooooooo
[2:04:31] <+MilkyShame> its the same way you should be treating comic multiverses. dont think about it too much

[2:05:07] <dds333a> LUL LUL
[2:05:20] <boti_balint> On the topic of Fate, feels like nobody plays Saber in this game, I thought she'd be way more popular
[2:05:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> guess people have their mains from the last game
[2:06:29] <%RyuuAoi> People still have mains from SF2 ha
[2:06:29] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:06:39] <+eanscrale> She's mostly there to move copies, Saber is kinda over represented even outside her own franchise let's say.

[2:26:11] <stormhawk9891> Oh man sitting in Spectator mode and seeing the inputs here is hilarious
[2:26:18] <DSD24> Isn't Saber of Red a Apocryha thing?
[2:26:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie you dishonor ROMA
[2:26:23] <%RyuuAoi> Fuck playing hungry! Play horny! Get into Fight Angels character creator next!
[2:26:29] <dds333a> Nero has bar none the dumbest dress I've ever seen LUL
[2:26:43] <DSD24> @dds333a Oh yeah can't forget about the ass window
[2:26:57] <OldManDeckardCain> I mean, she literally WANTS people to see it LUL
[2:27:02] <kingbreaker21> Alright. I'm new to this game, so I'm asking from a position of 101% naivety...is Saber that one character from that Fate/Zero anime???
[2:27:08] <mothdude> Wild how Fate actually got hornier after it stopped being porn
[2:27:09] <verdantgeo> That heat bait was sick!
[2:27:11] <DSD24> @kingbreaker21 Yes
[2:27:14] <%RyuuAoi> @oldmandeckardcain I can't see it. Links?
[2:27:15] <toulon_somberjade> It's dumb but it's also Nero, so it make sense she would dress herself like that
[2:27:18] <Aussie_Manny> LUL
[2:27:20] <dds333a> @oldmandeckardcain indeed she does LUL LUL
[2:27:21] <OldManDeckardCain> LUL
[2:27:23] <stormhawk9891> Fools! It's not revealing, she's just letting you see!
[2:27:23] <kingbreaker21> @DSD24 Thank you!
[2:27:48] <toulon_somberjade> Still not as bad as Ushiwakamaru
[2:27:49] <+KingpinLarry> I haven't been following development of this game. I didn't know Saber was in this.
[2:28:01] <+eanscrale> Fate was so much less horny when it was a limited sale visual novel with literal penis worms in it.
[2:28:18] <DSD24> @mothdude I think that's how it works in most media actually, if its not blatant then its up to the fans to supply it
[2:28:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie brings honor to ROMA
[2:28:50] <dds333a> @eanscrale a veryimportant, if laughable, plot point LUL
[2:28:55] <DSD24> I need my Boudica Avenger though

[2:29:30] <SpookyMooks> kouma looks cool
[2:29:36] <andre11dr> The only thing i know about Fate is that my girlfriend keeps telling to watch it ,and I'm like, these caracters look generic No! LUL
[2:29:45] <stormhawk9891> I'd like to show everyone my Okita Kohaku but I'm poopoo with her
[2:29:50] <%RyuuAoi> He's a smash player for sure
[2:29:57] <Aussie_Manny> Yeaaah, Reggie!
[2:30:05] <DSD24> @andre11dr Look up First Hassan he's in FGO and he's super unique
[2:30:11] <mothdude> Melty Blood characters have no drip but Fate is usually better with neat designs
[2:30:16] <+eanscrale> @dds333a It makes Kohaku and Hisui's bloodline "abilities" look way less ridiculous.
[2:30:20] <%RyuuAoi> @stormhawk9891 This is a judgement free zone. Always has been. Always will be.
[2:30:30] <%RyuuAoi> Unless you're Reggie
[2:30:35] <stormhawk9891> @RyuuAoi Well then....
[2:30:43] <brunoberserk> imagine saber's invisible sword in a game like soulcalibur , bullshit hitbox and everything NotLikeThis
[2:30:45] <%Sparkseid> you love it
[2:31:04] <dds333a> @dsd24 unfortunately not a central Fate character
[2:31:11] <%Irridium> damn good catch gg
[2:31:15] <DSD24> @brunoberserk Actually in SC2 Yung Seong had a invisible sword as one of his weapons he could pick so I can totally see it
[2:31:23] <Aussie_Manny> EX...CALIBAAA
[2:31:24] <dds333a> although I like the look of regular Hassan
[2:31:43] <DSD24> @dds333a Hundred Persona's is one of my favorites if we talking Hassans
[2:31:47] <%Irridium> one of these days I'll remember to heat. One day...
[2:31:50] <toulon_somberjade> @DSD24 what was that swords downsides?
[2:31:54] <anarchistPastry> @DSD24 i thought not seeing it was the point Kappa

[2:33:38] <DSD24> @toulon_somberjade Ok its name was Han Guang and you take more damage while guarding and your soul charge damaged your health

[2:33:55] <+undersea_magic> gg
[2:34:17] <verdantgeo> This Vlov is using the most optimal color
[2:34:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah, there's the okita colors
[2:34:42] <+comedianonfire> Vlov's chibi sprite with that color scheme reminds me of Ramlethal so much
[2:34:58] <DSD24> I should make a Okita alter color

[2:35:24] <Demoli_PT> @WoolieVersus have you checked the strive patch notes?
[2:35:43] <OldManDeckardCain> they talked about strive patch at the start
[2:36:06] <Shardlab> So this the Arcsys "I'm just having fun and don't feel pain" fighter of this game
[2:36:32] <Shardlab> There must always be a Slayer or a Rachel
[2:36:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:36:42] <boti_balint> Calibaaaaaaaaa
[2:36:54] <DSD24> Its Artoria instead of Altria

[2:37:23] <dds333a> LUL LUL LUL
[2:37:27] <DSD24> Jack Bros the best game on Virtua Boy
[2:37:29] <+KaosMachina> jackoff bros
[2:37:33] <dds333a> you missed one Kappa
[2:37:41] <+comedianonfire> Would be cool if Archer and Rin were in this game. I liked them from the little I have seen of Fate.
[2:37:50] <Shardlab> @DSD24 People are still doing that "Belly/Berry or Arucard/Alucard" crud after all these years?
[2:38:02] <andre11dr> Man ,is Noel really bad or something? I feel like I'm the only one playing her
[2:38:05] <Aussie_Manny> Is there an electric Jack in Persona/SMT games?
[2:38:09] <%RyuuAoi> Jack off Bros best Bros
[2:38:09] <Kenny_Riot> What are they playing on?
[2:38:19] <Kenny_Riot> @Aussie_Manny Nope.
[2:38:20] <DSD24> @Shardlab Well the problem is that Nasu the writer for these games prefers Altria for some reason
[2:38:38] <dds333a> @aussie_manny Frost Ace xan learn electricity but none are themed after electricity
[2:38:53] <dds333a> the third Jack Brother is Jack the Ripper
[2:39:17] <stormhawk9891> @DSD24 And IIRC even the translation team hated Altria but had to roll with it
[2:39:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the fourth Jack Brother is Jack-0
[2:39:54] <dds333a> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Fifth LUL Hairy Jack is fourth Kappa
[2:39:55] <mothdude> Melty Blood Type Lumina website says Artoria so I've decided that is correct
[2:40:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @dds333a Kappa
[2:41:09] <DSD24> @mothdude Can't argue with that
[2:41:48] <Shardlab> @DSD24 He can say it's neat as much as he likes, but Arthur/Artorius/Artoria Pendragon don't have any L's in their name. I swear, it's funny about some writers and their "It sounds cool, bro" stuff when they aren't native speakers of another language
[2:42:05] <DSD24> I know in the Saber Wars event coming up in FGO the weird energy source in that event is called Altrium which just sounds bad compared to Artorium
[2:42:39] <Sadnehs> I just bought this game yesterday. I rarely play fighting games but this one seems fun for me (tutorials a little... mind numbing though). There's... lotta mechanics lol
[2:42:39] <DSD24> The book!
[2:42:47] <Aussie_Manny> Get BOOKED!
[2:43:17] <Shardlab> I'll concede their point when the Japanese stop using X so weird and make phoenetic kanji for edge case stuff they don't use in their language
[2:43:21] <DSD24> I jumped in a bit late where there any Miyakos?
[2:43:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Sadnehs honestly best thing to do is learn the basics first, and then as you get better incorporate the mechanics one by one
[2:43:50] <stormhawk9891> @DSD24 No, and thank god for that
[2:43:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[2:43:54] <Aussie_Manny> The air is so dusty.
[2:44:03] <Sadnehs> Yeah ... I didnt finish the tutorial cause its so dry. I should just jump into arcade I guess.
[2:44:03] <DSD24> Aww I love Miyako she's the best
[2:44:11] <andre11dr> @sadnehs This series is kinda know for having a lot of mechanics
[2:44:32] <Sadnehs> The mechanics seem fun, but my brain smooth lol
[2:44:49] <Aussie_Manny> Haha, this is Max's favourite character. doodAnime
[2:44:52] <DSD24> Run up Burst lets go
[2:44:54] <Sadnehs> I just need a lot more time and effort to get them in my smooth brain lol
[2:44:55] <Shardlab> @Sadnehs Pick up the universal mechanics and then jump in. You'll need those options to add onto the character knowledge you'll pick up as preference
[2:45:27] <andre11dr> This man ,definitely blocking with his face

[2:47:59] <andre11dr> Those games are like 80 hours

[3:24:42] <%Taylorton147> you could easily think so @RyuuAoi
[3:24:56] <Shad0wTag> @ryuuaoi Pretty much, all he needs is an boxing alt version
[3:25:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> some say Woolie was based off of Nago
[3:25:24] <%Taylorton147> lost to history during the 100 year crusade
[3:25:40] <+invalid_robin> The Narnia burst

[3:36:57] <+Azhaaar> tragic
[3:37:55] <%bahookery> oh shit
[3:38:05] <zenith0111> 5Head Reggie omg
[3:38:24] <+Azhaaar> Reggie's burst baits are on point for sure
[3:38:46] <%bahookery> honest question, is it too late to get into this game at this point
[3:39:04] <%bahookery> I'm a complete noob and I feel like I'll just get curbstomped online
[3:39:10] <zenith0111> @bahookery No Strive is going to last a. long long long time
[3:39:14] <+Azhaaar> not at all @bahookery there's plenty of people at the lower floors
[3:39:22] <%Taylorton147> @bahookery everyones a noob at some point
[3:39:26] <%dreadedcthulhu> yeah we're still pretty early in strive's lifespan
[3:39:27] <DGmaka> You won't. The killers are all in the upper floors and cannot go down
[3:39:28] <zenith0111> only fighting games that have oow playetbases are "too late" to join
[3:39:32] <%DashXero> How many smurfs, though?
[3:39:33] <zenith0111> low*
[3:39:39] <waltzqueen> @bahookery we all start at the bottom
[3:39:44] <%snausages_> pick Axl and you can filter people with his first layer of (extremely honest) offense
[3:39:45] <zenith0111> @dashxero Towers prevent smurfing
[3:40:14] <%DashXero> Nothing prevents a determined-enough smurf.
[3:40:22] <DGmaka> @DashXero Even if someone tried to smurf, they'll only last like 3 matches unless they throw their matches
[3:40:29] <%bahookery> yeah I know, my fear is the lobbies just being full of killers and not many people at the beginner levels
[3:40:40] <%andrewofbob> It's buy to play, though. You're dropping money to drop your rating.
[3:40:41] <zenith0111> Or this might surprise you. The new players are just that good @dashxero
[3:40:47] <%Taylorton147> @bahookery you always have cpu arcade to train
[3:41:22] <+Azhaaar> @bahookery if you have friends who learn with you it's not so bad/stressful
[3:41:42] <%Taylorton147> @bahookery i mean you are going to regret not getting into it more than you are going to regret a tough online by the sounds of it
[3:42:55] <%Taylorton147> guilty gear also has a pretty good tutorial for a fighting game
[3:42:57] <+keiji_maede> nasty?
[3:43:02] <zenith0111> Dont be afraid to sit on that life lead against Millia
[3:43:05] <chance179> hi @WoolieVersus
[3:43:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current week's schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1447814216103104512?t=FMN9Zf2S4JsthZvBIlfXDQ&s=19
[3:44:09] <zenith0111> @taylorton147 Compared to everything else its actually kinda meh.
[3:44:23] <zenith0111> Still better than 90% tho
[3:44:29] <+FadingFrost> Man both you guys are eating this patch huh? How you liking the changes?
[3:44:35] <zenith0111> For actually even having it
[3:45:00] <%DashXero> After thinking about what you've said, zenith0111 , here's the problem I have with that statement. How many new players have cleaned your clock?
[3:45:05] <%Taylorton147> @zenith0111 i only recent got into fighting games tbf haha my fav tutorial so far is actually mk11 cause that explained alot of things to me
[3:45:33] <%ekodrop> reggie...
[3:45:38] <zenith0111> @dashxero Thats called projection
[3:45:56] <zenith0111> @taylorton147 I heard great things about MK11 tutorial
[3:46:11] <chance179> wow guilty gear is looking oretty sick
[3:47:06] <%DashXero> @zenith0111 I'll take that as a firm zero. My point being that new players may get lucky, but they can't actually be "good."
[3:47:29] <%andrewofbob> How viable is it chasing Zantetsuken as a win condition?
[3:48:03] <zenith0111> @andrewofbob Hotashi uses Blood rage multiple times in a match on purpose so I think its fairly viable
[3:48:26] <%dreadedcthulhu> reggie caught mashin?????
[3:48:29] <%dreadedcthulhu> PauseChamp

[3:53:23] <+sundayafternoon1> I guess they’re announcing the next character next month then, I had thought that would be October too last I saw the DLC chart
[3:53:27] <%DashXero> I was wondering if that would happen.
[3:53:28] <zenith0111> Crazy
[3:54:00] <%DashXero> October ain't over yet.
[3:54:09] <zenith0111> Tbf a new character after a huge patch like this sounds dangerous @sundayafternoon1
[3:54:58] <zenith0111> @woolieversus Blood Rage is + on Block btw
[3:55:15] <Brandon__Brando> I just want them to chill for a bit patch wise
[3:55:39] <Brandon__Brando> let this one sit for like months
[3:55:49] <Brandon__Brando> 4*
[3:56:16] <+sundayafternoon1> It will, unless next character is crazy strong or something which doesn’t seem like the trend
[3:56:27] <zenith0111> @brandon__brando I think theyre just trying to iron out the gameplay as quick and early as possible so they dont have to keep updating through its lifespan
[3:56:28] <+StrikeTheErf> @zenith0111 did they change it? because blood rage pop was always -7 on block
[3:56:42] <zenith0111> @striketheerf It Guard Crushes it cant be -
[3:56:52] <+StrikeTheErf> @zenith0111 that is not true, and I just checked, it's -7
[3:57:08] <zenith0111> It Guard Crushes. thats a fact
[3:57:20] <+StrikeTheErf> @zenith0111 guard crush just changes defensive options, it can be minus (Ram's second rekka used to guard crush but was -2)
[3:57:57] <JetpackMcQuack> nago smells like
[3:57:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:58:20] <@Solidus_113> air cancels

[3:58:32] <JetpackMcQuack> projectile stocks through the roof

[3:59:07] <%snausages_> axl is fun to fight
[3:59:26] <%snausages_> cause it's not the same rushdown stuff the rest of the cast imposes on you
[3:59:58] <SpookyMooks> the nago colour is nice
[4:00:16] <Shad0wTag> @tragosavich pc
[4:00:45] <Shad0wTag> @snausages_ as a pot main this is worse than hell
[4:00:54] <%Irridium> jesus fuck that's so much faster

[4:09:36] <NeroInfinite> Aussie internet
[4:09:51] <%DashXero> Ouch.
[4:10:09] <zenith0111> Millia fastest button was 7 frames before this patch @woolieversus
[4:10:23] <TopLeftCenter> It's a bit of a stealth command grab nerf, everyone can mash out of throw during the throw invuln frames
[4:10:32] <+Tragosavich> It's a night and day difference having a 5 frame on Anji
[4:10:47] <zenith0111> 6 frames oops
[4:10:51] <JetpackMcQuack> i feel like everybody should have at least something as an interrupt
[4:11:20] <%dreadedcthulhu> they made a lot of changes to improve defense across the cast ig

[5:10:22] <SpookyMooks> niiice
[5:10:25] <+invalid_robin> 214k is real
[5:10:27] <zenith0111> @daroosta89 She has the longest list of changes too
[5:10:36] <Brandon__Brando> ya I'm trying ram after the patch I don't want to deal with her
[5:10:51] <zenith0111> @cinless Thats intentional
[5:10:53] <JetpackMcQuack> jesus
[5:10:55] <%RyuuAoi> Zato broke af. Banned
[5:11:14] <cinless> @zenith0111 no way, it's based on camera position
[5:11:14] <SpookyMooks> noooo
[5:11:28] <zenith0111> @cinless Do you mean the explosion?

[5:13:25] <Brandon__Brando> ya that's what I was talking about but right now I'm trying ram I got to know how she feels
[5:14:41] <+Tonytehgreat> I'm that zato, nago v zato is a weird mu for nago bc it feels like he cant rush zato down when eddie is out
[5:14:48] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> @WoolieVersus ggs reggie
[5:14:53] <+Tonytehgreat> eddie is dead*
[5:16:07] <zenith0111> Thats why advanced Nagos really really make sure their combos hurt. The MUs give him less openings
[5:16:09] <TheSaltminer> are Quebecois really as mental as Pat's making them out to be?
[5:16:26] <+Tonytehgreat> also nago in zatos corner is hell for nago
