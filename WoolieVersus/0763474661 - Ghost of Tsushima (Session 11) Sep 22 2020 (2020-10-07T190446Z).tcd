[0:15:50] <%Proxzo> @SuperFightinRobot woolieYE
[0:15:52] <a_mad_dragon> saboteur is fun for the first two thirds of the game and then you get tired of it
[0:15:55] <+ManEaterPug> Everyone's hair on stream is immaculate
[0:15:57] <penitentpentwitch> Better than my name. I didn't bother to capitalize anything so people shorten me to "Pent Witch"

[1:20:06] <MayorRev> puppy!!
[1:20:38] <derap41> Remember when Jesse Cox Would always chase foxes in skyrim? You think a dev watched that?
[1:20:40] <yusefHD> Every once in a while I'll find a fox shrine without a fox and it'll just spawn for pets.
[1:21:02] <MayorRev> lil foxy
[1:21:12] <misterurbanthelegend> Nah you timed the roll wrong to early.
[1:21:15] <armchairmaster_> Goodbye fox

[1:21:58] <MayorRev> bruhhhh
[1:22:11] <penitentpentwitch> "Oh no! He's gone grayscale!"
[1:22:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> once they run they're one shot right?
[1:22:17] <MayorRev> and they just run away if you win all duels?

[1:25:01] <%CptnCampy61> I never really used way of the flame
[1:25:08] <penitentpentwitch> Honestly I prefer the 'sidequest tier' system where they're tied to areas that unlock as you progress. As opposed to Yakuza's "Well you can stall out for 6 hours in real estate right now."

[3:03:35] <CappuccinoGuil> YOU DON'T PAY MY SUB
[3:03:42] <arkv01> but what if i pay the sub and suddenly I'm behind you with a gun
[3:04:05] <T_Sasquatch> I still haven't encountered anyone crazy in ffxiv
[3:04:14] <T_Sasquatch> Almost 200 hours in
[3:04:18] <CappuccinoGuil> In MMOs, if you don't do your job, EVERYONE suffers. So by going "you don't pay my sub" is really shitty
[3:04:45] <CappuccinoGuil> now, if you're playing a single-player game or a chill game, people telling you how to play can be really annoying
