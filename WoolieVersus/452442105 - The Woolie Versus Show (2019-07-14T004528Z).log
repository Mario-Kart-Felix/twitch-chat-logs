[0:10:02] <Tha_Mik> no
[0:10:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> So what exactly does Jill Sandwich reference? I forgot
[0:10:06] <Redbee2000> Chris would never be so indecent

[0:10:54] <thepiefoot> @GarbageQueenEllie There was a trap in Spencer mansion that could've crushed Jill, therefore a "Sandwich"
[0:10:59] <+Kurt_0> A jillsandwich
[0:11:02] <+XeroSigmaPrime> @thepiefoot Hell yeah, the best thing about English, its easy to understand even with bad grammer. Use wrong grammar in french or spanish and it makes no sense

[0:23:51] <+razielhex> man, if this was RE4 that zombo would've already been suplex'd
[0:23:55] <rearedlogarithm> Even Leon's giving him shit.
[0:23:59] <$Tuskor13> what did pat mean by 2060 is when we make contact is he referencing something monkaS
[0:24:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hate it when headshots essentially do nothing
[0:24:10] <AncelDeLambert> Leon, quick, ask him if his right hand comes off
[0:24:11] <zenith0111> Not the head chat the brain!
[0:24:13] <CryptusMaximus> My personal method is to grenade the dormant zombies, flashbang the lickers, then run past them into the room. Then the lickers can be snuck past later
[0:24:16] <AncelDeLambert> that'll confuse him!
[0:24:25] <$FuqBoiSlim> The reference is that 2060 is the year we make contact 4Head

[0:48:23] <+vicious_rage> gimmi fuel gimmi fiah GIMMDAWIAHDABABA
[0:48:24] <%RioGascar> So if we find anime cringe, what is japanese cringe for japanese people???

[0:48:26] <majima666> my favourite video of australia is the guy punching the kangaroo....what a hero
[0:48:28] <+spacehouse> Woolie "seagulls are ducks" Madden

[0:48:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RioGascar it's cringe for them too
[0:48:35] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:48:35] <Run44forrest> that kid and dog dancing video makes up for all brazilian cringe
[0:48:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> SHUT UP
[0:48:42] <Hydrapissed> MASH em
[0:48:43] <+Redpointshine> synthol freaks are an underlooked part of cringe
[0:48:47] <allenpie04> woolie knows guns 101
[0:48:47] <Dragon_Batman> You poured the fuel in one to the other?
[0:48:48] <energywarning> rub your bic lighter reloads together
[0:48:48] <%Aussie_Manny> Oh, for Australian cringe, just look up any aussie up and coming comedian. VERY niche shit.
[0:48:49] <Fujiwara_92> NO SHUT UP
[0:48:50] <thepiefoot> It's fuel... just drip one into the other
[0:48:54] <bear_breaker20> @Run44forrest yes.

[0:49:00] <vingadivo> luffy is pretty much brazilian
[0:49:00] <Dapper_Cactuar> that pizza video is footage of crimes against humanity
[0:49:10] <iaraCatunda> @RioGascar honestly literally anything like laughing too loud on a public space is already cringe for japanese ppl
[0:49:12] <+Javaa01> I guess no one told Woolie that quick disconnect connectors exist
[0:49:14] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> @gigacanuck yeyeyeye atpRtsd
[0:49:18] <InugamiTheHound> remember when woolie thought in ww1 they used muskets. Or every gun with a drum barrel is a tommy gun
[0:49:23] <worldbrand> Is it possible we are glossing over the existence of cringe pornography
[0:49:24] <WanderingSwordsman> how far did woolie got?
[0:49:25] <lloyddboy> you no clipped one canister into the other
[0:49:27] <+Estuko> Leon is so cute, damn it.
[0:49:32] <thegreenbenis> @angriestpat Have you seen the Russian Synthol body builder.
[0:49:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> Japanese cringe is acknowledging that love exists
[0:49:38] <%RioGascar> Its the same tech for doom. Doomguy shall never reload his gun...except the super shotty
[0:49:38] <%Aussie_Manny> The taste of a liar.
[0:49:38] <allenpie04> liar zombie
[0:49:38] <+costumedJo> You essentially do the same with bullets in mags
[0:49:38] <thepiefoot> @WanderingSwordsman 1 to 2 hours left i would say
[0:49:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Luffy is a memer that doesn't know how to use his powers. Giant Dick

[1:13:14] <+vicious_rage> Doom II has a great Boss Fountain, but it does not matter much when you just need a handful of rockets
[1:13:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I"M VERY EXCITED NOW
[1:13:15] <+0oki> that was a waste lol
[1:13:18] <sage2001> when's mahvel
[1:13:19] <%SirGO0SE> the smart way to do it is to feed the player easy enemies that drop the items
[1:13:19] <majima666> well, in the original version of re2 they were planning to use computers as save points instead of typewriters
[1:13:23] <Dragon_Batman> I'd say one less health but you do you
[1:13:24] <Guardiansaiyan> @ozzrabbit be nice, its Woolie first time and Pat is being gentle
[1:13:24] <Tha_Mik> I mean. I would have tons of ammo too if I worked in a bio curse lab

[1:13:59] <iaraCatunda> is no bubbling test tubes ok?
[1:13:59] <$NitronStreams> Would you call a large enough "boss fountain" a "boss geyser"
[1:14:01] <%SirGO0SE> mmm ada
[1:14:01] <@Menitta> But I WANT my lab to look evil
[1:14:02] <worldbrand> hey man i was born in a bubbling test tube and i turned out alright
[1:14:10] <worldbrand> probably
[1:14:12] <InugamiTheHound> Pat why do they use typewirters instead of computers?
[1:14:16] <%Gogogolem> @WoolieVersus We have these testubes in the ciminology department....i guess i should be concerned.
[1:14:19] <Run44forrest> a boss should crash into a boss fountain
[1:14:20] <Ion_Laser> The evil can match the colors on the lab coats
[1:14:21] <zombie_goasts> That bubbling test tube is called a uterus

[1:14:40] <@Menitta> @Gogogolem There's gonna be a ton more crime in that lab then Kappa
[1:14:45] <+Mekhet09> bubbling test tubes are actually bad if it's overflowing. it means that solution is leaving the tube.

[1:53:27] <oniwahoo> I'm curious, does the fire on his arm do damage to him or is it just aesthetic?
[1:53:30] <RupanSen> only cowards don't run in his OHKO

[1:57:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Also I think 300 Flamethrower rounds would be enough for him, iirc
[1:57:00] <lewdskeletor13> Oh no ze music
[1:57:04] <+C24U> Can he actually be killed with raw damage?
[1:57:07] <Fujiwara_92> Kreygasm
[1:57:11] <wrydiculous> dun bother with remembering his startup pose EXCEPT for the one hit kill attack
[1:57:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @C24U yes
[1:57:16] <InugamiTheHound> a heart of fire is not killing him?
[1:57:17] <tyrano_the_wise> i think the original looks cooler, but this one fits better
[1:57:23] <+Caped_Eggy> It's very easy to knock him out of his charge, I think one shot of shutgun to his chest will stagger him
[1:57:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @C24U oh wait without the "weapon"?
[1:57:26] <+zanzibar_junker> You can make him miss as he charges at u by shooting him
[1:57:27] <iaraCatunda> OOP
[1:57:29] <count_bob> Why do you keep running in the corner woolie?
[1:57:35] <ExpressNode> Can the rubble ever fall on you and give a instant KO?
[1:57:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @C24U I think he only dies via the "weapon"
[1:57:38] <cerazor01> OOF, that audio
[1:57:41] <hot4dukat> beat him Woolie
[1:57:42] <ThorW> @C24U Since woolie won't read this no. His actual health is a timer until the game throws you the weapon that beats him

[1:57:45] <mikon> he's a blanka player. the corner is his dearest friend

[1:57:46] <+C24U> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Yeah thats what I wonder
[1:57:47] <Dragon_Batman> The damage accelerates when the weapon appears I think
[1:57:59] <iaraCatunda> "you got a lot in there" LUL
[1:58:00] <cerazor01> Audio no
[1:58:04] <ThorW> @C24U literally all Woolie actually has to do is survive until a certain point

[2:02:43] <ThorW> @C24U You actually don't have the time to kill Mr. X without the rocket. I've tried with the infinite minigun, can't do enough damage (or he just doesn't die without the rocket)

[2:03:18] <+waltzqueen> @wohdin i clapped when i saw your comment
[2:03:20] <DRAGKUDO> now we wait for Remake 3 and Dino crisis
[2:03:21] <Sir_stride> i honestly think this game is the closest we've ever gotten to a perfect video game
[2:03:25] <iaraCatunda> @wohdin true wisdom, galaxy brain
[2:03:26] <odiousprint> MUH SPIDERS
[2:03:28] <omicrondeftinwolf> @wohdin i see you are a man of culture as well

[2:03:36] <Stone_free_wolf> Now introduce Woolie to Dead By Daylight
[2:03:36] <InugamiTheHound> where's dino crisis?
[2:03:38] <FalseEyeD> I love the original, but I LOVE this one.
[2:03:39] <Dragon_Batman> Such a god like game
[2:03:45] <odiousprint> MUH SPIDEEERRRS BabyRage
[2:03:46] <jorniev> good ass game
[2:03:49] <DracaenaLeaf> They got rid of one of the good rooms didn't they?
[2:03:53] <+BurkeBigsby> It's not irrational if you have a reason
[2:03:57] <detritus25> When's Dino Crisis?
[2:03:59] <rytisone> when's fixed camera dlc tho?
[2:04:02] <@Menitta> This game is still probably my GOTY
[2:04:04] <mikon> "got the map down? good! Now open it again! and again! and again!"
[2:04:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> @odiousprint just wait for a spider-infested church in RE3 Remake WutFace
[2:04:13] <zedravan> They made him re3 nemesis
[2:04:15] <iaraCatunda> NotLikeThis
[2:04:18] <DXLelouch24> and IT'S NOT OVA YET WOOLIE
[2:04:19] <Sphincter_Spelunker> when's Countdown Vampires
[2:04:26] <RupanSen> Meh, people handled Alien Isolation
[2:04:28] <%Guardiansaiyan> Mr. X EXTREME
[2:04:32] <Dragon_Batman> Yup
[2:04:34] <+C24U> This game needs a Mr. X mode
[2:04:36] <DracoUltimus> This game is definitely my GotY
[2:04:37] <iaraCatunda> im proud woolie
[2:04:41] <dking0000> Capcom has 2 games in player for GOTY
[2:04:44] <dking0000> What year is it
[2:04:45] <+Kurt_0> Chris would just have a boxing match with mr x
[2:04:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> When will RE have a parry button? Kappa
[2:04:56] <allenpie04> Trickster is in RE3
[2:04:57] <thepiefoot> Emergency evasions are hard to do
[2:04:58] <Tha_Mik> nemesis is annoying
[2:04:58] <TheSphereHunter> a dodge button that literally doesn't work
[2:05:02] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Are we the Resident of Evil now?
[2:05:03] <@Menitta> I'd give it to DMC5 but it has no Vergil so its 2nd
[2:05:03] <%ShinTeach> and he SPRINTS
[2:05:03] <+C24U> Also he had a rocket launcher
[2:05:04] <Sir_stride> except he runs
[2:05:09] <%QueequegTheater> Jill is a way better fighter than either of them. Claire has some training and Leon is a cop, but Jill is a soldier
[2:05:10] <%SirGO0SE> im going to call them "movement abilities" from now on
[2:05:11] <FalseEyeD> Yeah, the dodge is crap in RE3
[2:05:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> what does the camera do in trickster
[2:05:13] <%Guardiansaiyan> Mister X in save room
[2:05:15] <%ShinTeach> and shoots ROCKETS
[2:05:15] <Dragon_Batman> The grunt he does gives him away a bit too much in 3
[2:05:22] <ThorW> Ah, the aggression mod
[2:05:23] <+C24U> @ShinTeach Also slides as he windup punches you

[2:18:46] <+PA_Raiden333> Claire B IS A GUN
[2:18:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> But what does it do on Trickster?
[2:18:47] <RayShadow278> Claire's new design honestly grew on me, the old one doesn't translate that well to modern graphics lol
[2:18:47] <Kemmybelle> Maybe Pat should be here.
[2:18:48] <%QueequegTheater> @InugamiTheHound sure buddy, has nothing to do with her original design not being as good as the new one Kappa
[2:18:48] <privatesargent> the first run is always A, the second run is the other characters B run
[2:18:49] <JDebss> How zaps do?

[2:18:55] <%Guardiansaiyan> @GohanEgret Baba is Claire
[2:18:55] <Alseid> but what does it get in Trickster'
[2:18:55] <%ALTRNico> L2Zap
[2:18:57] <thepiefoot> Damn, i thought IGN was dumb for getting this wrong
[2:18:57] <Fujiwara_92> PERSON A THEN PERSON B
[2:18:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> But what does Claire A does on Trickster?
[2:18:58] <RupanSen> Baba is Claire
[2:19:01] <Bakefowl> Zapped
[2:19:02] <starotter70> But C comes after B
[2:19:05] <$Louie_Salmon> Zapping system.
[2:19:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Baba is Woolie
[2:19:07] <rytisone> because car spins
[2:19:09] <dukenux> But Baba...
[2:19:10] <Kemmybelle> Make sure Woolie picks the right version at least to start.
[2:19:11] <$KnivesEve> this is why the zapping failed

[2:19:21] <Fujiwara_92> But what it does on Trickster?
[2:19:21] <Graxe_> It's easier to explain by watching the opening for B scenario
[2:19:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> But Claire CEASES to BE
[2:19:24] <Alseid> but Claire ceases to be!
[2:19:24] <eldragon_1> Its a GUN
[2:19:25] <dukenux> BABA DONT MATTER
[2:19:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli What does it do with Trickster?
[2:19:27] <StarlitStunner> But I don’t wanna drink the water
[2:19:28] <+BubbaRands> If Baba is Chris...

[2:29:11] <odiousprint> RE6 IS GOOD YOU SCRUBS
[2:29:11] <+itsjustdoogan> personally prefer ReRemake 2 to 7, but still loved it
[2:29:13] <thepiefoot> @ultimatemegahero1 I told him in his stream to repent, he denied
[2:29:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Bloodlineeeeeee
[2:29:23] <RupanSen> just play the hentai knockoffs
[2:29:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @odiousprint -Doubt-
[2:29:27] <ultimatemegahero1> lol

[2:29:33] <Tha_Mik> I loved that
[2:29:36] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Scholar of the First Sin version of DS2 did this a couple times too
[2:29:38] <odiousprint> 6 really is not that bad.
[2:29:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @odiousprint I'm sorry you feel that way
[2:29:42] <Medo3G> they trigger when you enter from them the other side
[2:29:56] <Djinnazz> it is not good Adious

[2:30:08] <mesamus> lickers
[2:30:10] <+Grayhammatter> adult G
[2:30:12] <odiousprint> RE6 is worth it just for the Mercenaries mode alone.
[2:30:16] <ultimatemegahero1> I agree 6 really isn't that bad.
[2:30:20] <+itsjustdoogan> Hope we get a RE Outbreak remake >.>
[2:30:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wish there was an RE campaign where you play as a character who just sits at the diner in Raccoon City and has pancackes until it's time to leave
[2:30:25] <+ItsRatman> Oh no, am I late?
[2:30:27] <+AGrinreaper> RE6 is a fun action game
[2:30:28] <TheNocturnalScotsman> i liked the old plants :(
[2:30:29] <thepiefoot> Ivys were lame
[2:30:31] <Hydrapissed> 6 can blow my ass
[2:30:34] <tpb847> i actually liked 6 more than 7, 7 was boring imo
[2:30:38] <DRAGKUDO> 2 legs, 4 legs, Monsters
[2:30:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> but my spiders tho
[2:30:42] <Tha_Mik> they were sloww too
[2:30:44] <Dragon_Batman> There was also spiders that are just gone
[2:30:46] <+AngriestAngryArtist> giant moth is gone too
[2:30:46] <rytisone> I liked 6, Chris's campaign is not great tho
[2:30:51] <Aruezi> 6 is just a garbled mess due to 4 storylines being crammed together
[2:30:53] <odiousprint> MUH SPIDERRRS BabyRage
[2:30:54] <marvel877> Station - 3 hours; Sewer - 3 hours; Lab - 2 hours at most.
[2:30:56] <Dr_Mooose> yeah
[2:30:57] <Tha_Mik> I'm glad spiders are gone
[2:30:59] <mesamus> @tpb847 you have shit taste, got it 4Head
[2:30:59] <worldbrand> spiders cute
[2:31:01] <Timesteel> yeyeye
[2:31:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Aruezi That's 1 of the reasons 6 is a garbage mess.
[2:31:06] <+Kurt_0> Spido suck
[2:31:08] <%QueequegTheater> Spiders are good bois who kill wasps
[2:31:10] <hot4dukat> 7 was gross 😛
[2:31:11] <godzookylives> Neptune
[2:31:12] <Aruezi> on their own each of the stories would have been fine
[2:31:12] <thepiefoot> Spiders were scary the first fucking time, they added nothing to the game
[2:31:13] <%GohanEgret> no step on snek
[2:31:13] <+BopBeep> Moth Boss was silly
[2:31:14] <+C24U> Yawn is the most boring name
[2:31:14] <cerazor01> Nobody talks about Yawn
[2:31:17] <FalseEyeD> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[2:31:19] <+Grayhammatter> Neptune
[2:31:21] <RupanSen> the shark room was cool tho
[2:31:26] <TheNocturnalScotsman> neptune was cool for the first exsperience
[2:31:30] <cerazor01> People need to talk about Plant 51 more.
[2:31:31] <+IamScorpius> The sharks are so dumb I love them
[2:31:32] <%QueequegTheater> DRAGOON IS COOL WOOLIE
[2:31:34] <InugamiTheHound> resident evil outbreak 1 and 2 had amazing animal fights
[2:31:35] <tpb847> @mesamus 7 was trash, eat my ass
