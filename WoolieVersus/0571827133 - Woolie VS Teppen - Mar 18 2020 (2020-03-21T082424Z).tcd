[0:16:30] <SheefEatsBeef> it's trippy
[0:16:31] <+Weeewer> I like this X
[0:16:32] <%SpaghettiTime44> Didn't Dante used to be Red?
[0:16:37] <+skylerpilot> X's design is sick
[0:16:40] <NWannabe> This X is not human looking at all
[0:16:42] <resloxxx> Cyber-elf X kinda look
[0:16:43] <+Weeewer> Dante always been purple in this game
[0:16:45] <+Psycosis> im hating these black decks,they destroy my best cards so easily
[0:16:45] <stormhawk9891> Apparently X got buffed this season
[0:16:47] <StarkMaximum> No, Dante's been purple since launch
[0:16:51] <+nobotie> Is there a figma of sigma?
[0:16:55] <%JustYudha> He looks kinda pregnant...
[0:16:58] <StarkMaximum> At launch Morrigan and Dante were the purple heroes, Ryu and Rathalos were red
[0:17:01] <%JustYudha> I cant unsee it
[0:17:05] <+scrumbotime> Pregaman
[0:17:05] <+1bigwayne> twink
[0:17:09] <+Sulfur_Boride> X got buffed supe rhard with Charge Shot thanks to Resonate units in Green giving HP.
[0:17:10] <+MrBaldachin> 😳
[0:17:10] <NWannabe> Zero look the same?
[0:17:10] <Ristwach> LUL
[0:17:11] <%SpaghettiTime44> Oh, right, it was rathalos who was the other red one
[0:17:11] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:17:12] <BreakersAweigh> OH GOD
[0:17:13] <+glgzephyr> yeah X needs all the buffs he can get. He was literally the worst hero last season
[0:17:13] <+BionoidLCR> MegaPreg
[0:17:15] <NotHereToStream> no
[0:17:15] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:17:16] <+Weeewer> he looks like Seth
[0:17:17] <%Irridium> megapreg
[0:17:18] <+Psycosis> robopreg
[0:17:18] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Preg X
[0:17:19] <+velvy_ky> Nah that's just a ball joint
[0:17:21] <%EyeFarted> ORB LIKE PAT
[0:17:21] <%theblackotaku98> LUL LUL
[0:17:22] <+ItsRatman> megapreg
[0:17:23] <+Sulfur_Boride> X went from being the worst to being the best
[0:17:23] <Dragon_Batman> they really went ball joint heavy with this design. still like it tho
[0:17:25] <+OnlyNumber1> X makes me think of SIC figures to be honest
[0:17:25] <+Weeewer> Pregaman
[0:17:26] <@Solidus_113> Preggaman
[0:17:27] <+nobotie> Pregaman
[0:17:29] <@Solidus_113> DAMN
[0:17:29] <+chiazam> Preggers
[0:17:29] <+Premium_Heart> ruined it forver
[0:17:30] <+scrumbotime> Pregaman X has equiped the Pregabuster
[0:17:31] <%winds_0f_change> pregaman x
[0:17:31] <StarkMaximum> It doesn't strike me as pregnant, it feels like his stomach is like a point of articulation, like Woolie said, an action figure
[0:17:34] <BreakersAweigh> Pregaman X
[0:17:38] <+Weeewer> @Solidus_113 too slow
[0:17:39] <TigerClaws12> Preggaman X
[0:17:39] <StarkMaximum> it feelsl ike I could just bend him forward or backward
[0:17:39] <%theblackotaku98> pregannnanant
[0:17:43] <Twoiis> Has Woolie played the megaman zero series?
[0:17:45] <+chiazam> Pregaman Battle Network
[0:17:46] <SheefEatsBeef> SPIKY BOI
[0:17:47] <+NYCrownlessKing> where's the Zero love @WoolieVersus
[0:17:47] <+Weeewer> Nergi <3
[0:17:49] <+Psycosis> fuck this guy
[0:17:55] <Dragon_Batman> God he was so brutal at the start
[0:17:55] <stormhawk9891> Sick, as an X main I was kinda bummed with how weak he was
[0:17:57] <+NYCrownlessKing> show that new boy <3
[0:17:57] <+skylerpilot> yeah thats how I always saw it, as a Megaman Zero thing
[0:17:59] <+ItsRatman> Okay thats pretty damn cool
[0:18:00] <gordieda20> Oh boi Season 1 Spike Nerg LUL
[0:18:01] <%SpiritOfOdin> Miss S1 Nerg
[0:18:02] <+chiazam> Look at him
[0:18:04] <StarkMaximum> Yeah I usually don't play Black but they gave Black two of my fucking favorites, Nerg and Akuma
[0:18:10] <SheefEatsBeef> what do the colors mean tho
[0:18:12] <+scrumbotime> Pregaman is pregigante?
[0:18:13] <+Weeewer> Nergi been solid every season even after nerfs
[0:18:14] <+Sulfur_Boride> Wesker's probably the most broken with Uroburos and all the Destroy shit
[0:18:14] <+griffball13> TOTAL GLOBAL SATURATION
[0:18:16] <+NYCrownlessKing> playstyles @SheefEatsBeef
[0:18:19] <stormhawk9891> Weskers fun
[0:18:20] <Ristwach> Rakuuha Zero is so annoying. I'd rather take S1 Nerg
[0:18:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> COMPLETE
[0:18:23] <StarkMaximum> @SheefEatsBeef Have you ever played Magic? It's classifications, and each color has a unique strategy.
[0:18:24] <+skylerpilot> Mono Black is so cancer
[0:18:25] <KiraKamixephos> Man I hate wesker
[0:18:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> GLOBAL
[0:18:28] <+chiazam> Wesker
[0:18:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> SATURATION
[0:18:37] <+nobotie> What is Nergigante? Is that the main monster of Monster Hunter?
[0:18:40] <+Superbro64> So THIS is the solo lp I see Kappa
[0:18:40] <+chiazam> THE ULTIMATE BIO-WEAPON
[0:18:43] <SheefEatsBeef> goootcha thanks @NYCrownlessKing @StarkMaximum
[0:18:45] <DamnJP> "you'll give me an egg!"
[0:18:45] <Dragon_Batman> I think they have a super low rate on them
[0:18:46] <@Solidus_113> Where's the sprite
[0:18:46] <%JustYudha> OooOo
[0:18:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[0:18:52] <restingbones> lumpytGasm
[0:18:53] <+Psycosis> I used her until Zero came out
[0:18:55] <+BionoidLCR> titers
[0:18:56] <+Sulfur_Boride> This is a pretty good design for Morrigan in this art style
[0:19:00] <StarkMaximum> @nobotie It's big in World, it shows up a lot to attack you while you're dealing with the final boss of Low Rank
[0:19:00] <SheefEatsBeef> oh the milkers
[0:19:00] <StrikingEarth> Yeezus, bring back old sprite Morrigan
[0:19:02] <+gutlesscoward> do they have the darkstalkers sprite
[0:19:03] <+chiazam> Damnnnn
[0:19:04] <+Psycosis> scottish
[0:19:05] <Twoiis> nerfed too hard
[0:19:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> I thought she was scottish
[0:19:13] <critfumble_> i mean its celtic idk that its irish its not scottish either
[0:19:18] <+glgzephyr> Do we know when Little V will return?
[0:19:20] <critfumble_> its very ambiguous
[0:19:26] <+skylerpilot> @nobotie there really isn't a "main monster" in MH Nerg was what they call a "flag ship" monster for the launch of World
[0:19:26] <+chiazam> That is NOT PG
[0:19:32] <+Skyridge0> I think the Morrigan is a Scottish myth?
[0:19:36] <frostazul> isnt v in this game too
[0:19:36] <+Sulfur_Boride> Succubi are of Scottish origin. Her actress is Welsh, tho.
[0:19:37] <+nobotie> I meant flagship
[0:19:39] <StarkMaximum> @SheefEatsBeef Basically, red is damage and aggro, green is mana production and big units, black is sacrificing yourself for more power, and purple is trickery and counterplay
[0:19:40] <stormhawk9891> Not mention constant stuns
[0:19:42] <+glgzephyr> Morrigan has a light Scottish accent
[0:19:42] <+nobotie> Thank you both
[0:19:45] <+MrBaldachin> he's still pretty spiky
[0:19:45] <StarkMaximum> BIG RATH
[0:19:48] <+Weeewer> Fiery Boy
[0:19:50] <Ristwach> Rath is on fire lol
[0:19:55] <@Solidus_113> King of jobbers
[0:20:00] <+chiazam> Gonna go watch Interspecies now
[0:20:01] <+Sulfur_Boride> Rathalos is prob the worst Hero in this game rn
[0:20:03] <BurdRightsActivist> Black Mesa tho?
[0:20:03] <+Weeewer> Rath had a season where he was busted
[0:20:06] <+Weeewer> But no longer
[0:20:11] <StarkMaximum> R/G Rathalos used to be seriously over the top but they nerfed him to death
[0:20:12] <Ristwach> Wrath Awoken was annoying in the past
[0:20:12] <+glgzephyr> Rath has like one viable deck but it's not great compared to most others
[0:20:14] <+glgzephyr> THIS BITCH
[0:20:21] <gordieda20> YAWN
[0:20:21] <Jaku2011> Danm
[0:20:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:22] <BurdRightsActivist> ResidentSleeper Lee
[0:20:23] <NWannabe> Rath = woolieTRASH ?
[0:20:24] <+Psycosis> booooo
[0:20:28] <+Weeewer> YAWN-chan
[0:20:31] <Dragon_Batman> chunners has to be the best in everything she is in
[0:20:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yo but Jill tho
[0:20:37] <+Weeewer> Yawn got nerfed too yeah
[0:20:39] <SheefEatsBeef> @StarkMaximum so there's the colors that dictate a general playstyle and then characters make it more specific?
[0:20:40] <+glgzephyr> Her ability wins the game
[0:20:47] <+Skyridge0> Jill always sounds like she's out of breath
[0:20:48] <NWannabe> the strength of those thighs to hold it up all day tho
[0:20:50] <restingbones> Gun
[0:20:51] <+Weeewer> Great Jill design
[0:20:54] <Dragon_Batman> I love jill
[0:20:56] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus there is a pretty decent Flying, combo deck with Blazing Wall right now
[0:20:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hero Art: Ultimate BIO Weapon
[0:21:02] <%jinking79> Not many Villain Characters in the game
[0:21:03] <StarkMaximum> @SheefEatsBeef Yes. Ryu and Rathalos are both red, so they're both damage-based and tend to be aggressive, but a Ryu deck will have a very different take on its red cards from a Rathalos deck
[0:21:06] <rysku> ''couple''
[0:21:13] <stormhawk9891> a "couple"
[0:21:16] <extradopeness> Oh god the 3S taunt is actually meta ?
[0:21:24] <SheefEatsBeef> @StarkMaximum fuckin rad. thanks dawg
[0:21:28] <+Psycosis> I had a feeling you were using blac/green
[0:21:38] <Ristwach> Oh great a Rakouhouha
[0:21:40] <Dragon_Batman> yep @extradopeness it's super good
[0:21:43] <NWannabe> Zero looking more human than X
[0:21:48] <StarkMaximum> @Psycosis You'd think he'd default to black/purple, lol
[0:21:52] <StarkMaximum> Err, green/purple
[0:21:52] <+Weeewer> Ooooh Woolie plays a mixed deck
[0:21:52] <resloxxx> best robot
[0:21:53] <StarkMaximum> my bad
[0:21:54] <BreakersAweigh> woah johnny yong bosch versus johnny yong bosch
[0:22:02] <Ristwach> Time for Exodia
[0:22:12] <Vortigon> FireSpeed
[0:22:13] <LeaIsChill> Oh this is weird. Definitely not what I expected when I listened to the podcasts
[0:22:16] <seylumiue> Wonder what hes fighting for
[0:22:24] <extradopeness> Looks like I’m getting into this tonight
[0:22:29] <+glgzephyr> nidhogg doesn't seem great in a two color deck
[0:22:29] <NWannabe> I wanna see the champ level scum time out technique
[0:22:39] <StarkMaximum> Yeah so people who don't know thsi game, expect to see a lot of situations where someone puts down a card and it's immediately destroyed. If that's the case, just assume they put down a unit solely to take out the enemy unit, even if they're gonna lose theirs
[0:22:41] <stormhawk9891> @SheefEatsBeef For instance, Rath focuses on attack buffs while Ryu focuses on straight up damage
[0:22:48] <Ristwach> This Zero deck is super brain dead
[0:23:15] <SheefEatsBeef> cool cool
[0:23:22] <stormhawk9891> This theme Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:23:32] <StarkMaximum> yeah the music is super clean
[0:23:39] <StarkMaximum> Very cool remixes of all these characters' iconic themes
[0:23:49] <zenith0111> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:23:58] <Dragon_Batman> you can also set it to you character theme and not the enemies which is a nice change up
[0:24:08] <StarkMaximum> @Dragon_Batman Oh i didn't know that, that's cool
[0:24:19] <+skylerpilot> Sheild woolie, so he can't Rak you
[0:24:25] <stormhawk9891> I never thought I needed an orchestral remix of Lock and Load till this game
[0:24:43] <+glgzephyr> he gets super the next card he plays lol
[0:24:59] <Dragon_Batman> @starkmaximum yea it's nice cuz running into a string of weskers or whatever helps
[0:25:06] <%TheOneCalledRock> wait zero has a field wipe?
[0:25:20] <rysku> Listening to Johnny Young Bosch fight Johnny Young Bosch is making me feel so lost
[0:25:25] <+skylerpilot> @TheOneCalledRock yeah
[0:25:25] <+Weeewer> Zero can deal up to 12 split damage
[0:25:31] <+TheJaydedFox> There is so much style and flair in this mobile card game
[0:25:33] <+Weeewer> Depends how much Memory he has
[0:25:38] <%TheOneCalledRock> god damn.
[0:25:45] <+skylerpilot> @TheOneCalledRock Zero is busted
[0:25:47] <NWannabe> woolieLORE
[0:25:51] <jetswerve> @rysku after Persona 4, you get used to it.
[0:25:58] <+skylerpilot> easily the best hero in the game right now
[0:25:58] <+Weeewer> Woolie about to take 12 damage
[0:26:04] <%TheOneCalledRock> and i thought akuma's raging demon was crazy
[0:26:12] <Dragon_Batman> has he built to 12? not yet
[0:26:17] <+Weeewer> Ah he doesnt have enough yet
[0:26:23] <rysku> hahaha true @jetswerve
[0:26:25] <+Weeewer> Great timing on his part
[0:26:26] <KiraKamixephos> Hahaha
[0:26:34] <+Weeewer> That might be game
[0:26:36] <+glgzephyr> GG
[0:26:44] <resloxxx> get maverick'd
[0:26:45] <+Weeewer> OOOOf
[0:26:47] <+glgzephyr> lol is it?
[0:26:49] <stormhawk9891> That's game
[0:26:49] <+Psycosis> I love stealing,especially against green
[0:26:58] <+NYCrownlessKing> wait but he's under ur card effect so 4 dmg will kill zero?
[0:27:01] <KiraKamixephos> You almost had that
[0:27:02] <reonome> F
[0:27:02] <SheefEatsBeef> oh shiiit
[0:27:02] <+Weeewer> lmao
[0:27:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dead wright Kappa
[0:27:07] <+Weeewer> Green + Black mixed deck, might be worth explaining the color system @WoolieVersus
[0:27:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> *weight
[0:27:07] <+NYCrownlessKing> rip nvm
[0:27:07] <Phyrrist> "he's giving it flight, that's fine"
[0:27:08] <+glgzephyr> I hate stealing so much in this game
[0:27:09] <+skylerpilot> Steal is the worst
[0:27:10] <stormhawk9891> Fucking flight
[0:27:10] <StarkMaximum> Right down to the wire
[0:27:13] <Dragon_Batman> wow he gets the apple effect too? didn't realize that
[0:27:18] <NWannabe> Dead weight indeed
[0:27:21] <+Psycosis> yoink
[0:27:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20

[0:27:27] <+Sulfur_Boride> I ruined one Zer
[0:27:29] <resloxxx> ECON TAKE
[0:27:33] <%TheOneCalledRock> WAIT
[0:27:35] <+ItsRatman> Nidhogg had a change of heart :)
[0:27:38] <%TheOneCalledRock> ZERO's PURPLE?
[0:27:41] <+Sulfur_Boride> *one Zero's game by stealing their buffed Reso Hsien Ko with Dante
[0:27:46] <+skylerpilot> yeah hes purple
[0:27:47] <+glassesaregod> Yes, Zero is Purple.
[0:27:52] <restingbones> "As far as I know" Just how many cards are there to keep track of in this game?
[0:27:58] <%TheOneCalledRock> and they gave him a FIELD WIPE?
[0:28:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> never make your dick too big Kappa @WoolieVersus
[0:28:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dream battle
[0:28:13] <YakumoYomi> I don't know Teppen, but the idea of "don't make a card too good, in case it gets stolen" is something I know well from Yugioh
[0:28:14] <+glassesaregod> @restingbones There should be close to if not over 1000 cards in-game at this point
[0:28:17] <NWannabe> @NYCrownlessKing Else they'll steal it
[0:28:18] <SheefEatsBeef> WOOW
[0:28:19] <+Sulfur_Boride> EVEN WORSE
[0:28:20] <Ristwach> Bricked
[0:28:20] <Dragon_Batman> yea his field wipe needs to build but it's really good
[0:28:21] <+griffball13> 7 mins
[0:28:21] <+Weeewer> GG
[0:28:22] <reonome> LUL
[0:28:25] <StarkMaximum> This has happened to me
[0:28:26] <SheefEatsBeef> unlucky
[0:28:26] <+NYCrownlessKing> field wipe requires prep @TheOneCalledRock
[0:28:26] <thwak> that's a card game lol
[0:28:26] <+BionoidLCR> POG LUL
[0:28:27] <StarkMaximum> it SUCKS to death
[0:28:29] <+Psycosis> gfb
[0:28:31] <zenith0111> SHIT IS CRASH
[0:28:31] <+gutlesscoward> gg no re
[0:28:34] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:28:35] <+NYCrownlessKing> zero does not have it at the start @TheOneCalledRock
[0:28:35] <NWannabe> this game don't have mulligans?
[0:28:41] <zenith0111> TOO MANY SPELL CARDS
[0:28:43] <restingbones> @glassesaregod thats insane, no way a game like that is balanced right?
[0:28:44] <DamnJP> wow
[0:28:47] <+nobotie> What just happened?
[0:28:47] <StarkMaximum> @NWannabe He just did, he mulligan'd into a losing hand
[0:28:47] <Ristwach> Mulligan was the solution
[0:28:47] <+Weeewer> Wellll you gotta build your deck so that doesnt happen
[0:28:48] <+skylerpilot> you get to mull once
[0:28:48] <Dragon_Batman> you only have 1 mulligan
[0:28:48] <KiraKamixephos> You gotta structure your deck better
[0:28:52] <+BionoidLCR> @NWannabe you just saw him do it....
[0:29:03] <NWannabe> ah, missed it
[0:29:08] <StarkMaximum> @nobotie The five cards in his hand all required him to have a unit on board, meaning none of them can be played, meaning he cannot draw cards at all. YOu have to play cards to draw more cards.
[0:29:19] <StarkMaximum> @WoolieVersus It happens, man. It sucks but it happens.
[0:29:19] <Dragon_Batman> it used to be 0 so hey moving on up lol
[0:29:23] <NWannabe> do you gotta mull all 5?
[0:29:25] <stormhawk9891> That's why I make sure My action cards don't outnumber my characters
[0:29:32] <PlayTEPPEN> Addressing Brainwash, you could run "Fusion" to destroy the card they are trying to steal and reroute their stats to another friendly unit you have on the field :)
[0:29:34] <StarkMaximum> Yes, you have to mull the whole hand
[0:29:34] <+skylerpilot> @NWannabe yeah
[0:29:35] <Ristwach> Yes @NWannabe
[0:29:42] <%TheOneCalledRock> even still with the building, that is still crazy
[0:29:43] <NWannabe> Bah @EVA_Unit02
[0:29:46] <+Weeewer> Yoo Dev In Chat

[0:29:55] <+nobotie> @StarkMaximum Thank you. That seems like a vast oversight that should be fixed.

[0:30:30] <%Irridium> @abelincoln_catpuncher whenever little V thinks he's good and not filled with the rona. (he just came back from Florida)
[0:30:38] <SheefEatsBeef> god i'm just imagining wesker and nero at a table throwing down cards and insulting eachother
[0:30:41] <abelincoln_catpuncher> darn/:
[0:30:42] <+skylerpilot> @Weeewer its new this set
[0:30:44] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus In my experience "Evasive Roll" AKA stat reset is pretty versatile
[0:30:50] <StarkMaximum> @nobotie It can be fixed, it's fixed by making your deck such that it doesn't rely on having units on th e board. That is a risk you take, because the tactic of "play a unit and then power it up to all hell" IS actually a decent one, but it results in situations like that.
[0:30:52] <zenith0111> HAHAHA
[0:30:55] <Dragon_Batman> oh wow
[0:31:02] <StarkMaximum> Teppen giveth, Teppen taketh away.
[0:31:06] <LeaIsChill> @WoolieVersus Dev in chat just told you about Fusion for Brainwash!
[0:31:06] <zenith0111> People HATE bad draws
[0:31:11] <NWannabe> Coin flip in action
[0:31:23] <FloresIsDead> is woolie wearing a tunic?
[0:31:31] <StarkMaximum> Oh shit I didn't notice the official account was here
[0:31:43] <+skylerpilot> kills 1 attack not life
[0:32:05] <+skylerpilot> goes through shields, instantly kills batteries
[0:32:07] <+nobotie> Thank you, stark
[0:32:08] <Dragon_Batman> playteppen here? neat
[0:32:11] <SheefEatsBeef> ooh i see
[0:32:14] <+skylerpilot> *unbuffed batteries
[0:32:29] <stormhawk9891> Revenge is some fun bs
[0:32:35] <fabo_joyful> Bulldhit blazing!
[0:32:49] <StarkMaximum> @nobotie np np, I play a lot of games and I hear a lot of opinions. In a perfect world, unplaayble hands simply wouldn't exist, but it's impossible to reach a perfect world like that.
[0:32:49] <zmuno> wait.. what's this?? O.o
[0:33:08] <LeaIsChill> Woolie, PlayTeppen is here!
[0:33:12] <+Weeewer> Woolie, the devs were dropping you some hot anti-steal tech
[0:33:23] <NWannabe> play a wierdo deck @WoolieVersus ?
[0:33:35] <+NYCrownlessKing> Teppen team recommended the Fusion card for green decks to stop purple tactics of brainwashing @WoolieVersus
[0:33:38] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus Dev in chat
[0:33:51] <+Skyridge0> oh, the zombie turtle deck
[0:33:53] <StarkMaximum> He prolly won't be able ot respond while he's in-game, lol
[0:34:05] <%TheOneCalledRock> @PlayTEPPEN do you have any tips on how to build a deck like that?
[0:34:07] <+Weeewer> Ooooh hes a Black + Red ryu
[0:34:13] <KiraKamixephos> Wouldn’t ascension akuma mess you up bad then? You got a lot of 3 mp units
[0:34:20] <PlayTEPPEN> A deck like Woolie's?
[0:34:27] <Dragon_Batman> gotta remember to check out fusion
[0:34:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:34:31] <+Wool> OFFICIAL TEPPEN?
[0:34:36] <+GeneralHysterics> Oh shit, now we in there
[0:35:00] <%TheOneCalledRock> a deck that doesn't rely on powering up units. that seems it would take one hell of build
[0:35:04] <+skylerpilot> @StarkMaximum You could possibly insure that there is a unit in the starting hand as long as the deck has say over 10 units in it. That way you can game with gimmick decks that run low unit ammounts and it also doesn't break those gimmick decks that require their unit to be sent to the graveyard first
[0:35:04] <StarkMaximum> @PlayTEPPEN Whoever's behind this official account, do you personally have any favorite heroes or colors?
[0:35:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> if you want info on deck suggestions, visit the Teppen discord. doodGood
[0:35:12] <+GeneralHysterics> oh man, they just ripped the audio right from dmc5
[0:35:17] <+GeneralHysterics> let's get airborne!
[0:35:19] <+NYCrownlessKing> we all look at deck concepts and share them with people to try out doodGood
[0:35:23] <StarkMaximum> @skylerpilot Yeah, this is true. Having a good balance is the important part.
[0:35:27] <+Weeewer> she does NOT live
[0:35:33] <+Weeewer> Ohh she did :o
[0:35:44] <%TheOneCalledRock> @NYCrownlessKing will do. Thanks!
[0:35:46] <StarkMaximum> But sometimes a gimmick deck can just go the hell off with its opening hand and win immediate,y and that's the appeal that makes it worth it to risk an unplayable hand
[0:35:59] <seylumiue> This remix is great
[0:36:15] <PlayTEPPEN> This account is run by 2 different people. But we like Nergigante and X.
[0:36:28] <StarkMaximum> @PlayTEPPEN Nice, thanks. Just curious
[0:36:34] <cornerstorecoroner> Damn i havent seen red black yet
[0:36:53] <+glassesaregod> @seylumiue All of the characters have great reimaginations of iconic themes from their games. :D
[0:37:09] <StarkMaximum> oh shit that robot has bangs
[0:37:10] <+skylerpilot> @StarkMaximum thats what im saying though, it would keep those gimmicks intact as it would require them to run more units that they ever would anyway for it to take effect. While insuring more normal decks can always play something
[0:37:17] <jubejube56> For some reason when Woolie plays this game he seems to enter an ASMR zone
[0:37:17] <seylumiue> Def gonna check them out lol
[0:37:24] <PlayTEPPEN> Seems like a lot of people like running a mixed deck with Black because of Sigma in this season
[0:37:26] <+silvery_cricket> Dead Weight
[0:37:37] <NWannabe> underestimating ryu? GG
[0:37:39] <thwak> that guy seemed to have a pretty hardcore control deck

[0:38:05] <+Weeewer> oh boy this mfer is good
[0:38:07] <Bustahhwulf> its seems running black LUL revenge should cost life
[0:38:07] <StarkMaximum> no rage, only chill
[0:38:11] <+nobotie> I am glad there is no rage.
[0:38:11] <+Psycosis> decks that rely on action cards get so fuckin sannoying
[0:38:13] <JonesInTheFastLane> monkaS
[0:38:23] <+glassesaregod> This mono purple zero, so I'm expecting X-Hunters
[0:38:26] <+nobotie> I cannot take streamers with no self-control.
[0:38:30] <+silvery_cricket> Petition to make it whenever a Nero player loses we say Dead Eight. Aye or Nay?
[0:38:36] <FloresIsDead> so chill the tearse freeze on the way down
[0:38:38] <NWannabe> Aye
[0:38:48] <+NYCrownlessKing> NOO
[0:38:50] <+NYCrownlessKing> dont seal!
[0:38:50] <+glassesaregod> Too late
[0:38:51] <+Weeewer> lmfao
[0:38:54] <StarkMaximum> SHOOT FIRST ASK QUESTIONS LATER
[0:38:55] <+glassesaregod> WRONG TARGET
[0:39:18] <%TheOneCalledRock> @Psycosis ye, but it's also easy to get destroyed by them too. at least in my case
[0:39:19] <+skylerpilot> drop layer
[0:39:28] <fuji_92> we card gaming PogChamp
[0:39:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> OOOO
[0:39:43] <+Weeewer> ayyy
[0:39:48] <StarkMaximum> YOU'VE ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD
[0:40:01] <LeaIsChill> Zero seems like a punk
[0:40:02] <+NYCrownlessKing> dont buff her up too much
[0:40:11] <+skylerpilot> Mizu is great
[0:40:13] <FloresIsDead> is he winning?
[0:40:16] <+Weeewer> Woolie has good control
[0:40:24] <SheefEatsBeef> oh shit bubble dargon
[0:40:24] <+Weeewer> but Zero got supers lined up
[0:40:25] <StarkMaximum> @FloresIsDead He's in a good position but it's anyone's game
[0:40:25] <LeaIsChill> @FloresIsDead 23 health to 14 health so ig
[0:40:25] <+NYCrownlessKing> 23 vs 14. yes
[0:40:28] <+BionoidLCR> @FloresIsDead i mean he has more health so i would assume so
[0:40:45] <StarkMaximum> In fighting games term Woolie has the advantage right now
[0:40:56] <FloresIsDead> yeah but cards tho
[0:41:00] <%TheOneCalledRock> CARD FOOTSIES
[0:41:04] <FloresIsDead> thanks anyways haha
[0:41:04] <%Exiliator> This duel is now a shadow game

[0:43:36] <%TheOneCalledRock> @chambatron i don't think so? as a person who doesn't have very good deck building skills, i haven't had a terrible time with my nero deck
[0:43:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> NO WOOLIE
[0:43:38] <chambatron> Only 5 mp? How many colors is woolie using?
[0:43:39] <+NYCrownlessKing> lmao

[0:43:46] <fuji_92> ZA warudo
[0:43:48] <+NYCrownlessKing> NO MR SIMPSON NOOOOO
[0:43:49] <StarkMaximum> How many cards can you play in the stopped time?
[0:43:53] <+Weeewer> how many of your own units can you kill in the stopped time
[0:43:54] <FloresIsDead> MASAKA
[0:44:03] <StarkMaximum> @chambatron Two. Mono gets 10. Dual gets 5. Trio gets 3. You can't go beyond trio.
[0:44:09] <+NYCrownlessKing> whatever cards u can paly @Weeewer
[0:44:16] <%JustYudha> *me not knowing what's going on* Yes haha that was indeed a stupid move
[0:44:23] <StarkMaximum> I have never seen a triple-color deck succeed but if anyone has, they can prove me wrong. Playing with only 3 mana seems like too much of a downside
[0:44:26] <PlayTEPPEN> You can play as much as your MP will allow you, unless your opponent resolves
[0:44:35] <+Psycosis> that destroy is
[0:44:41] <+NYCrownlessKing> tyrant is only put out on field because it auto kills any enemy unit that only has 1 attk @JustYudha most green cards
[0:44:48] <+Weeewer> @JustYudha killing that unit kill sall of your 1 attack units. Woolie was going to buff his unit but killed it before buffind his own attack
[0:44:51] <+NYCrownlessKing> esp common one's players like to use, have 1 atk @JustYudha
[0:45:00] <chambatron> I didn't really think Nero was viable as I have destroyed all the Neros I fought but maybe they were really bad
[0:45:14] <+Psycosis> SEAL
[0:45:19] <chambatron> I use Jill and I think most of the red decks are pretty low iq. Just do damage
[0:45:27] <@SoushinSen> Woah PlayTeppen is here?
[0:45:29] <+Weeewer> id seal the crow tbh
[0:45:31] <chambatron> And maybe buff your chars
[0:45:39] <jubejube56> This theme is giving me lots of nasty AT Nerg flashbacks
[0:45:43] <+NYCrownlessKing> nice
[0:45:56] <%TheOneCalledRock> imagine triple colors arn't impossible, but are hard as balls to pull off
[0:45:59] <StarkMaximum> @SoushinSen Whassup, Minh!
[0:46:01] <%TheOneCalledRock> i imagine*
[0:46:04] <Phyrrist> Love that alt art Predation
[0:46:07] <FloresIsDead> super at the start of the second round energy
[0:46:13] <@SoushinSen> What's cookin'?
[0:46:20] <+Weeewer> clutch
[0:46:25] <+NYCrownlessKing> the safest of plays
[0:46:27] <+Sulfur_Boride> Big brain play there
[0:46:29] <PlayTEPPEN> Every Hero is viable if you have a strong deck strat. TheThirstyGames has made top 100 with X before this season and everyone called X the worst Hero LOL
[0:46:39] <+NYCrownlessKing> ^
[0:46:53] <chambatron> I have fought X and gotten bat shit destroyed
[0:46:57] <StarkMaximum> That is true. Some heroes are obviously much better than others, but don't let that stop you from trying the ones you want. You just might struggle to find decklists if no one is playing those heroes.
[0:47:13] <+Weeewer> good game
[0:47:17] <%TheOneCalledRock> just like fighting games. tier lists are meaningless if you got the commitment
[0:47:22] <%TheOneCalledRock> at least in some games Kappa
[0:47:24] <StarkMaximum> Rathalos has been nerfed to death but I will still play him because HE IS RATHALOS
[0:47:25] <chambatron> Then again Red decks don't really have a gimmick more than just do damage
[0:47:34] <NWannabe> Woolie found his chatless solo LP game. Dude is going, verbally. I mean.

[0:52:32] <+Weeewer> For a 3 drop thats amazing
[0:52:52] <+skylerpilot> yeah shes a good 3 drop
[0:52:53] <duskrush> I rock a Jill deck
[0:53:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> id recommend trying out Turtloid in your green deck @WoolieVersus
[0:53:05] <NWannabe> phobos real name?
[0:53:24] <@Solidus_113> She's the raid monster made of gold
[0:53:29] <c60_Jam> Yo that was Lucia vs Akuma
[0:53:31] <chambatron> @duskrush me too how you holding up?
[0:53:31] <+paladinstarbuster> kulve chan

[0:53:48] <reonome> yo thats OP as fuck
[0:53:50] <+Weeewer> Big HP
[0:53:55] <+Weeewer> 6 drop though so its not free
[0:53:55] <+skylerpilot> That Mika is great early, she dodges the majority of removal in the game as well
[0:53:55] <chambatron> 6 tho
[0:53:57] <VVerewolfJones> I wish I had a good enough phone to play this :(
[0:54:00] <fuji_92> THICC HP
[0:54:01] <NWannabe> Musclepower in action eh?
[0:54:03] <+Thatghostpepper> GOOD starter card
[0:54:09] <StarkMaximum> "Explore for Trauma" is such a POWERFUL sentence.
[0:54:09] <duskrush> @chambatron pretty good. I just modified it to add more instant damage cards to avoid letting the opponent build up. It gets me to champion with decent effort
[0:54:11] <+nobotie> I was right
[0:54:28] <Bustahhwulf> every akuma card is akuma fighting someone LUL
[0:54:37] <@Solidus_113> Fukkin Chameleos
[0:54:41] <VVerewolfJones> It's never Akuma doing his laundry
[0:54:45] <VVerewolfJones> Washing his one shirt and pants.
[0:54:51] <Phyrrist> Akantor and Chameleos are rad monsters
[0:54:51] <+Weeewer> Blaze Heatnix is VERY good
[0:54:54] <StarkMaximum> Blaze Heatnix is legit one of my favorite Mavericks of all time
[0:54:57] <%Exiliator> Akuma doing his taxes
[0:55:00] <+paladinstarbuster> DMC2
[0:55:01] <c60_Jam> Who?
[0:55:01] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:55:05] <c60_Jam> Looks like some nerd boss
[0:55:06] <fuji_92> who
[0:55:07] <SheefEatsBeef> oh WOOOW HES IN THIS
[0:55:11] <chambatron> @duskrush There's a claire redfield that does 6 damge to the unit in front if your explore is 3 and there's a guile who has death and gives a detonation that deals 6 damage you you might wanna check that one out
[0:55:13] <VVerewolfJones> Akuma combing his weird mane/frill hairstyle
[0:55:20] <StarkMaximum> One thing I wish this game would do is it would tell you what franchise a card comes from
[0:55:23] <+skylerpilot> only answers to 6drop Mika outside of units / damage are Brainwash, Obliteration, or the random destroy cards that don't see a bunch of play
[0:55:35] <StarkMaximum> I have trouble making out what's a DMC card and what's an RE card because I don't play those games as much
[0:55:39] <c60_Jam> BEST AR
[0:55:41] <@Solidus_113> beautiful

[0:56:14] <+scrumbotime> Laura is absolutely getting it
[0:56:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> JOJO JUSTICE OLD HAG Kappa
[0:56:29] <duskrush> @chambatron Oh yeah I got 3 of those in my deck but just in case I ain't got my explores in, the others are good for a quick kill/shield break. I also have the one that sends your card to EX and does 5 split damage to the enemy. It's great for escaping a high damage, destroy, or steal
[0:56:31] <+NarcissistCactus> save that for plague
[0:56:45] <NWannabe> juni's a blonde now?
[0:56:49] <+MegaMillenniumX> plague might like it
[0:56:53] <+skylerpilot> why did Force Seekers give DMC2 so much love lol
[0:57:03] <StarkMaximum> @skylerpilot Because someone has to
[0:57:05] <chambatron> @duskrush Nice, I'll look into that one
[0:57:12] <+Weeewer> Mr Dev pls add Phoenix Wright into this game, thank you
[0:57:19] <stormhawk9891> Red Alert
[0:57:25] <StarkMaximum> Huh, Red's a red card. Wild.
[0:57:33] <+NYCrownlessKing> RE6 WutFace
[0:57:33] <stormhawk9891> Kinda pricey though
[0:57:34] <abelincoln_catpuncher> wow they even refrenced X7 that trash heap
[0:57:34] <NWannabe> Synergy!
[0:57:34] <StarkMaximum> What is Red from, y'all?
[0:57:35] <duskrush> @chambatron and it only costs two to use so you'll always have it ready for a reaction no matter what
[0:57:36] <%Irridium> LUL
[0:57:43] <resloxxx> x7
[0:57:46] <@Solidus_113> He wants money
[0:57:48] <c60_Jam> Jake was cool
[0:57:50] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus He's fun though
[0:57:50] <+prime_name> He's kinda cool
[0:57:51] <+paladinstarbuster> Jake is cool in a vacuum
[0:57:53] <LeaIsChill> The idea of Jake is cooler then Jake
[0:57:54] <StarkMaximum> Don't listen to Pat, Pat's bitter and spiteful. Make your opinions
[0:57:54] <gordieda20> Jack was cool
[0:57:58] <abelincoln_catpuncher> X7, complete trash game @StarkMaximum
[0:57:59] <fuji_92> baby wesker sounds cool, but yeah
[0:58:01] <Dragon_Batman> the only thing kool about him is that he can do that but the rest sucks
[0:58:06] <c60_Jam> JUST PARRY

[1:10:20] <illTemperedSeaBass> And they run when the sun comes up.
[1:10:31] <+nobotie> A wise man once said "It's like a jungle sometimes. It makes me wonder how I keep from going under."
[1:11:08] <Dragon_Batman> it helps with memory now

[1:31:27] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus you going to be doing any Room Matches with chat Woolie?
[1:31:50] <Bustahhwulf> woolie action locked
[1:32:01] <itsgundamu> wait you onlly have 5 of those mana points?
[1:32:11] <ike_shamus> Tbf, that worm deck is really hard to beat once it gets going.
[1:32:16] <+NYCrownlessKing> 2 color decks will nerf your mana cost @ItsAGundamu
[1:32:18] <%BubbaRands> *Monday Mitten Masher Intensifies*
[1:32:31] <+NYCrownlessKing> 3 color decks drop you to 3 mana @ItsAGundamu
[1:33:03] <itsgundamu> oh, I haven't played teppen since it came out
[1:33:17] <+NYCrownlessKing> but what woolie is doingto counter that, is he's hoping to not pull his powerful card. send it to the graveyard then throw it on the field.
[1:33:27] <Bustahhwulf> heart tank farfaWeird
[1:33:28] <+NYCrownlessKing> to avoid the limitation of not being able to play cards over 5 mana in your hand.

[2:57:04] <i_heart_gaming> insurance policy
[2:57:16] <+skylerpilot> when playeds don't happen
[2:57:23] <TheThirstyGames> @42nfl19 Three different Hero Arts for Nero. Devil Breaker to buff damage to a unit temporarily. True Power (DT esentially) to grow a unit that can grow. and Hey Nico! to call Nico to give you a random action card.
[2:57:46] <+Sulfur_Boride> GGs
[2:57:48] <i_heart_gaming> omg lol
[2:57:51] <i_heart_gaming> gg
[2:57:58] <buthidaebomb> charge shot x might be better with this meme deck
[2:58:12] <+YiggityYoni> HahaLean
[2:58:16] <+chiazam> Does Nero have DT?
[2:58:17] <+skylerpilot> @buthidaebomb it onlyl works with Nero
[2:58:29] <%KaosMachina> I would watch Pat but honestly seeing you play Teppen looks way more interesting.
[2:58:34] <+skylerpilot> @buthidaebomb Dal requires 20 to grow, and Nero can cause an instant growth lvl
[2:58:47] <+chiazam> Yeah RE6 hurts to watch
[2:58:56] <BalloniWright> Evil Ryu PogChamp
[2:59:00] <+chiazam> I’ll catch up on the VOD
[2:59:08] <+wolf34736> @KaosMachina I agree
[2:59:10] <%Exiliator> Ryu in his bleach cosplay over here
[2:59:16] <sperium3000> I've been running a wesker revenge deck that got me to C but I sorta got stuck there
[2:59:21] <buthidaebomb> oh yeah,the grow effect on h.a. but wouldn't auto heal and charge bump his a.p. and health also?
[2:59:31] <+NarcissistCactus> kage atpRtsd
[2:59:41] <fmc009> FINALLY THE TEPPEN STREAM
[2:59:49] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> does woolie knows about arcsys?
[2:59:59] <%Exiliator> Yes Woolie knows
[3:00:00] <@Solidus_113> he knows
[3:00:05] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> good
[3:00:10] <fmc009> what about arc sys?
[3:00:14] <%KaosMachina> RE6 with Pat and Woolie would be a fun mess
[3:00:22] <%KaosMachina> RE6 with Pat alone is just sad
[3:00:27] <Thedandywizard> @fmc009 they’re putting rollback into strive
[3:00:29] <sperium3000> strive will have rollback
[3:00:36] <%KaosMachina> GGPO?
[3:00:36] <fmc009> GG SAVED
[3:00:40] <+Bl4kDynamite> well that was bs

[3:00:49] <+Bl4kDynamite> muy hand was all revive
[3:00:52] <%KaosMachina> Street Fighter V Rollback
[3:00:56] <fmc009> @WoolieVersus put the QR code for your deck tho
[3:01:09] <+skylerpilot> @buthidaebomb the whole point of the Dal deck is to cause his Growth effect to clear the enemy board, You also try your best to create as many Copies of Dal as you can. Nobody but Nero has any way to cause Dal to hit his Growth with that meme deck, Dal is almost the only unit in the deck
[3:01:17] <+chiazam> Yo throw that QR code my way my guy
[3:01:48] <fmc009> all of us low level teppen player fiending for codes KappaRoss
[3:02:02] <+chiazam> I need that TECH

[3:02:05] <%xpakeo> Super happy Woolie finally did that TEPPEN stream, ive been waiting on this for a LONG time
[3:02:15] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Who's gonna be dead weight?
[3:02:20] <+DukDota> gg strive announced rollback !!
[3:02:36] <buthidaebomb> @skylerpilot yeah I know that nero is the standard but I thought I saw a deck with x using him to is all
[3:03:08] <Joysta> uhh big resonates *_*
[3:03:09] <LeafarOz> do this is the teppen
[3:03:12] <buthidaebomb> maybe not,I have so many decks I cant even remember anymore..lol

[3:04:05] <+DukDota> rollback confirmed
[3:04:16] <+robobeau> 👌👌👌
[3:04:24] <+DukDota> Kreygasm
[3:04:25] <lambishly> Woolie should check out slay the spire
[3:04:34] <LordoftheBadgers> Woolie's know how and strategies of Teppen is so entertaining.
[3:04:35] <+skylerpilot> @buthidaebomb X could throw a Dal into his mono charge shot deck, its a huge body that dodges a lot of removal, chances of proccing the Growth are low but Nero is the only character that can run the meme setup where Dal is the exclusive unit
[3:04:43] <buthidaebomb> damn why couldnt u of left all those 1 attack units up when I had a tyrant woolie
[3:04:59] <fmc009> LOCK AND LOAD PogChamp
[3:05:12] <+Sulfur_Boride> I think those Hsien Kos were too crucial

[3:12:01] <@Solidus_113> Now... Let's talk about netcode for 30 minutes
[3:12:06] <%SirGO0SE> going to check it out for sure, wish there was referral link or something
[3:12:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[3:12:37] <HorseGum> twitter @ArcSystemWorksU
[3:12:45] <HorseGum> they just posted it's confirmed Strive will have rollback
[3:12:48] <cerazor01> SeemsGood good tact
[3:12:51] <%Exiliator> Digital multiplayer could be fun
[3:12:58] <+Superbro64> woolie are you getting this? @woolieversus
[3:13:20] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Thank god
[3:13:27] <%Exiliator> Kappa netcode? Never heard of her. Kappa
[3:13:30] <$SilverRoddo> A iphone hdmi adapter. I assume.
[3:13:36] <@Solidus_113> Closed Beta Test too https://us6.campaign-archive.com/?e=[UNIQID]&u=ff227aa6fc76bb7726d1f114d&id=8e2c6f3fae
[3:13:50] <@Solidus_113> Beta is still using Delayed though
[3:14:03] <+TheBesteban> I have no proof that translating that netcode video into Japanese helped, but I'll take the credit anyways
[3:14:19] <Prevot> now we hope it can somehow work its way into dbz and granblue too
[3:14:28] <+zalonar> apparent;y sfv is improving theirs again too
[3:14:32] <@Solidus_113> Now pray for the custom Rollback to be injected into Granblue
[3:14:32] <%Exiliator> Truth
[3:14:34] <@Solidus_113> I doubt it though
[3:14:36] <NotHereToStream> bruh this is good
[3:14:53] <MoonlightP> i'm hopeful about dbfz and gbfv getting it since the whole process of removing delay-based and implementing rollback is already happening for strive
[3:15:26] <%Exiliator> Clearly it was all thanks to the Castle Super Beast Podcast! woolieMIRIN
[3:15:36] <+Superbro64> BRUH. They adding rollback AND they are fixing the UI.

[3:19:16] <TigerClaws12> @Solidus_113 @WoolieVersus Zinac who worked on KI is doing it so there's some credibility

[3:19:27] <Bustahhwulf> outsourcing the one guy from korea
[3:19:31] <Bustahhwulf> that did sfv
[3:19:32] <%kulmoth> @WoolieVersus apperntly one of the KI netcode people help out
[3:19:36] <+Superbro64> reminder that it took capcom 3 games to make their rollback good @woolieversus
[3:19:44] <NotHereToStream> japanese pride sure sucks
[3:19:46] <+Superbro64> sfxt > sfv > mvci
[3:19:49] <+richardlikespies> we got the grand finals reset
[3:19:52] <MoonlightP> there was a tweet by zinac talking about how he's trying to avoid the common pitfalls of rollback implementation
[3:19:52] <tusk102> @WoolieVersus pat theorized that it would be good rollback due to them even listening to fans yelling about rollback
[3:20:10] <@Solidus_113> Step 1 of 3 for GG Strive being great
[3:20:20] <@Solidus_113> get rollback, step 2 is have it be good RB
[3:20:28] <@Solidus_113> Step 3 is crossplay
[3:20:32] <cerazor01> pppfft
[3:20:32] <+BoBoGaijin> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:20:35] <+richardlikespies> step 3 is baiken
