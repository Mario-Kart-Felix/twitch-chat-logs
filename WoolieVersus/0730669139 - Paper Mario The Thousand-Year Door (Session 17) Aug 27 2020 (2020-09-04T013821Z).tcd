[0:06:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cappuccinoguil Different conditions for each one? Neat.
[0:06:49] <%CappuccinoGuil> Sometimes the Betrayer will be "the person on the left of the haunt activation"

[1:03:08] <%dekubaka> just viv to victory
[1:03:11] <savetitania> it's driving me nuts
[1:03:18] <%Solidnick18> maybe till your done with this area
[1:03:28] <+EdenOfLove> ice power does give you +1 attack on ice guys
[1:03:45] <%dekubaka> what? no
[1:03:47] <%chosenjuan42> Fire drive only worth it if you can one shot
[1:03:48] <atomicxdj> that works
[1:03:50] <Polarix64> @EdenOfLove Wait it does I didn't know that
[1:03:51] <savetitania> but it matches viv's cost
[1:03:56] <savetitania> does it overpower viv?
[1:04:09] <%SirGO0SE> Rem Lezar
[1:04:12] <%Koover> flower saver not worth it imo, its only 1FP

[2:10:34] <+botchdogg> Don't bomb the messenger
[2:10:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Hey it’s not his fault! :(
[2:10:42] <RunoEddie> I'm guessing he's just taking a trip through all the chapter towns

[2:10:46] <cosmicgoatee> Frijoles matter in the grand scheme of the burrito called life Woolie
[2:10:47] <+regis_j_rock> This man gave you a Super Hammer and this is how you repay him?
[2:10:50] <garsedj> "reggie, is this a big backtracking chapter?"
[2:10:53] <+botchdogg> that's not how it works
[2:10:54] <%Jp3g95> ruuS
[2:10:55] <PKSomething> I doubt it'd work
[2:10:56] <%Exiliator> No wonder Nintendo didn't want the second one
[2:10:57] <Nomad94> Nope
[2:11:00] <+blaze__drag> NOPE
[2:11:02] <%chosenjuan42> you can't
[2:11:02] <Mr_Strut> sadly no
[2:11:03] <+botchdogg> You have to go throught the checkpoints
[2:11:04] <nyacoo> gotta activate the flags
[2:11:06] <ShiningAxis> TRIGGERS
[2:11:07] <%ringabal> No No No says Nintendo
[2:11:07] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> It wouldn't work, the dialogues are triggers.
[2:11:10] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> the flags
[2:11:11] <CirclesForever> unfortunately not how t works
[2:11:11] <%chosenjuan42> sadly nah
[2:11:11] <cosmicgoatee> nope
[2:11:14] <missingangle> You fucking wish
[2:11:15] <NotHereToStream> you wish
[2:11:15] <Papa_Bearman> By the way, @woolieversus ...did I mention that this section of the game is Hell incarnate?
[2:11:16] <+blaze__drag> NOTENDO
[2:11:21] <SixthSun2> It's a set of dialog triggers, so no
[2:11:23] <jettsetter> this part feels intentionally obnoxious but I don't know why they did it
[2:11:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> The event flags are bullshit blazing

[2:11:30] <%Chatterbox1991> Man the entire latter halg of this entire LP is salt ladden as f

[2:11:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @PKSomething
[2:11:50] <%Chatterbox1991> REGGIE
[2:11:52] <RunoEddie> guess they just want you to go through every town
[2:11:55] <+EdenOfLove> woolie the trouble stuff is 100% optional so the backtrack trek makes sense
[2:12:10] <Nomad94> We're suffering alongside you
[2:12:14] <shiny_prinny> it's weird because you can totally sequence break the Pianta shop password but not this
[2:12:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @the_timo the game has had sequence breaking before, to be fair
[2:12:16] <RunoEddie> aren't there any troubles he could pick alongside?
[2:12:17] <missingangle> @chosenjuan42 if someone said this is the best, they lying their asses off. no matter how good the rest of it is LUL
[2:12:19] <Scorilla> @EdenOfLove it absolutely does not

[2:12:44] <nyacoo> Backtracking is never fun tbh
[2:12:46] <shiny_prinny> it's still awful design tho
[2:12:48] <%cookieface127> ?
[2:12:48] <plankk56> this is just ffxiv's main storyline quests in a nutshell, go over say hi to this guy now go over there and say hi to that guy okay now do it again
[2:12:52] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie Brain Not
[2:12:57] <time_axis> backtracking is fun in metroidvanias
[2:12:57] <+clapbeat> optional or not it sucks lol
[2:13:08] <Darthkitten_Prime> @nyacoo I think it can be fun if that's how the game works, like in metroid.
[2:13:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:13:09] <edward11231> I’m glad they cut that shit down in FF14

[2:13:32] <+DeRedBaron> truth be told, i actually hate it when people say anything "x" is bad design cus legit that is bs nothing can be bad by nature, things good in one game arent' always good in other games
[2:13:38] <dinnydanny777> Twilight Town maybe?
[2:13:40] <+DeRedBaron> it means you just dont like it
[2:13:41] <+zero_jacks> its a biiig run around
[2:13:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yep
[2:13:46] <%Chatterbox1991> I love this chapter now! :)
[2:13:47] <%chosenjuan42> NO ONE LIKES CHASE OF GOOSE
[2:13:47] <missingangle> If they add more stuff to the backtracking aside from just the backtracking, stuff to make it WORTH it, then that's less aggravating.
[2:13:50] <prime_name> Not great
[2:13:50] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> HMMMM dark.... omegaLul
[2:13:52] <cosmicgoatee> LUL woolies frustration of heading 3 rooms over is rising
[2:13:53] <%Proxzo> yeah it stinks
[2:13:56] <%MonsterEnvy> No one likes the search for General White.
[2:13:57] <shiny_prinny> This main quest, and Frankie saying "I love you" 100 times are genuinely awful design choices
[2:13:58] <jettsetter> this is still annoying either way
[2:13:58] <dinnydanny777> GivePLZ White
[2:13:59] <Drusain> 2004
[2:14:13] <time_axis> I think it's literally just to get you to intentionally be annoyed
[2:14:14] <Polarix64> Also can you imagine not doing the trouble board and missing out on Ms. Mowz that makes no sense
[2:14:15] <%Rosen_Thorne> Oh this part is universally hated, yes.
[2:14:20] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> it’s like a scavenger hunt for general white
[2:14:24] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> jump
[2:14:27] <+DeRedBaron> really? that's weird i actually loved thsi part
[2:14:28] <%morgantj> It’s not great
[2:14:29] <+blaze__drag> tbh I think that the frankie saying I love you 100 times was a pretty good bit, and can be mashed through pretty quickly
[2:14:29] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> i kinda like it LOL
[2:14:31] <+thatguychris93> @time_axis yeah especially how it ends
[2:14:31] <+botchdogg> I think they knew how annoying it was considering how it ends
[2:14:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @shiny_prinny at least you know how long Frankie talking will take
[2:14:36] <Polarix64> This point is dumb regardless
[2:14:38] <%ringabal> Oh someone donated
[2:14:42] <%Proxzo> You got bits
[2:14:43] <%Proxzo> hahaha
[2:14:51] <+regis_j_rock> The Frankie gag is fine, it takes like 2 minutes
[2:15:00] <%chosenjuan42> koops stronk
[2:15:01] <missingangle> At least with Frankie, you can spam the A button to continue and get done with it
[2:15:03] <+blaze__drag> whereas this thing takes like 20 minutes
[2:15:06] <edward11231> It’s pointless, there’s no reason to do this besides waste the players time
[2:15:08] <+regis_j_rock> This is obnoxious though, but hardly ruins tbe game
[2:15:12] <pistofficer> FOOTSIES!
[2:15:22] <+botchdogg> This felt a lot longer as a kid
[2:15:28] <%cookieface127> nnout
[2:15:35] <%chosenjuan42> Single goomba boss
[2:16:01] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> it adds to the tension!
[2:16:12] <CirclesForever> hella powerful
[2:16:14] <shiny_prinny> yeah not a game ruiner but it's just bad
[2:16:20] <%ringabal> Imagine doing this as an all HP build
[2:16:24] <garsedj> will they do the 100floor pit before the end of the game?
[2:16:28] <jettsetter> was this supposed to be a joke at the player's expense?
[2:16:30] <Polarix64> @regis_j_rock True this section is dumb and stupid but the game is still fine, I would still argue the entire Punie chapter is worse than this
[2:16:31] <+botchdogg> hp
[2:16:32] <time_axis> all FP
[2:16:33] <%chosenjuan42> did he do ceiling pipe?
[2:16:36] <prime_name> All hp?
[2:16:36] <atomicxdj> all hp
[2:16:37] <@akuda_bar> all health
[2:16:38] <time_axis> no BP or HP
[2:16:39] <%chosenjuan42> bad badges
[2:16:41] <CirclesForever> all bp, but no badges
[2:16:42] <Papa_Bearman> @ringabal I HAVE done this all HP.
[2:16:42] <+blaze__drag> ALL HP would be boring as fuck
[2:16:42] <missingangle> Or when you play this as a kid, never found the pipes like a dumbass and actually went through all the worlds normally.
[2:16:43] <garsedj> i had 50 hp in my first playthrough!
[2:16:43] <shiny_prinny> @jettsetter seems like it
[2:16:50] <%NopeBadguy> worst build is probably pure hp
[2:16:50] <@akuda_bar> all hp, no moves
[2:16:59] <Drusain> Bad build = nothing but skills
[2:16:59] <Papa_Bearman> All HP is SO FUCKING BORING.
[2:17:04] <+blaze__drag> with FP you could at least use your powered up moves like ultra hammer and such all the time, and all BP is the best
[2:17:10] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Mayor?
[2:17:11] <shiny_prinny> birds or the mayor?
[2:17:15] <Papa_Bearman> All FP is Super Hard Mode.
[2:17:15] <+blaze__drag> and splitevenly would just sorta be okay
[2:17:18] <%pectusumbra> mayor I'd assume
[2:17:20] <%pectusumbra> all HP
[2:17:20] <missingangle> Hey, ask Eva Kappa
[2:17:25] <%chosenjuan42> no FP worst
[2:17:28] <+blaze__drag> but all HP would just mean fights take forever and you barely have any choices to make
[2:17:34] <Papa_Bearman> All HP, I ran into no trouble whatsoever until the final boss.
[2:17:36] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> home?
[2:17:37] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> All FP is terrible
[2:17:37] <%Koover> inn maybe?
[2:17:40] <%pectusumbra> inn?
[2:17:42] <Rhinoprotoss> He's dead
[2:17:45] <CirclesForever> were would you go if you were tired?
[2:17:45] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> HP at least gives you tankiness
[2:17:46] <prime_name> Poshly?
[2:17:47] <%ringabal> @WoolieVersus He went home
[2:17:48] <whiteblacklight74> bird gang
[2:17:49] <Polarix64> He went back to the Peadows
[2:17:53] <SixthSun2> I mean, there's only two regions left that he's not been at
[2:18:00] <%pectusumbra> I mean I'd check before leaving
[2:18:01] <cosmicgoatee> Peadows
[2:18:05] <@akuda_bar> none of these people are correct
[2:18:07] <%chosenjuan42> Did Woolie get the pipe?
[2:18:07] <Polarix64> He went back to his house
[2:18:15] <+james_cest_drole> He went home
[2:18:16] <Slim_Lipid> I'm correct :)
[2:18:17] <shiny_prinny> chat is one guying pretty hard

[2:18:58] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> ?
[2:19:00] <missingangle> To be fair, that hint isn't all that helpful
[2:19:00] <jettsetter> he lives at the outpost

[2:22:45] <Papa_Bearman> Speedrunners never see Fahr Outpost at all.
[2:22:48] <ShiningAxis> santa is missing the "oh" in the beginning

[2:59:57] <%chosenjuan42> Lucky start is pretty cool
[3:00:09] <shiny_prinny> do you get negative defense in this game?
[3:00:12] <%pectusumbra> or just item hog?
[3:00:16] <%Koover> options are nice
[3:00:17] <GooseyGanderer> FP Plus perhaps?
[3:00:19] <hassanico2> No negative defense
[3:00:21] <%Rosen_Thorne> Pretty Lucky would be a good choice
[3:00:27] <%chosenjuan42> flower saver too
[3:00:27] <Polarix64> More FP is always good
[3:00:43] <GooseyGanderer> You keep struggling with FP loss
[3:00:49] <time_axis> if it were me I'd bring up HP to 30, but you dont have another HP up right now
[3:00:52] <%chosenjuan42> toe down timing add lucky start

[3:02:02] <hassanico2> Does the whole game feel slower and not just the jumps?
[3:02:02] <GooseyGanderer> Not gonna lie, that was pretty stylish.
[3:02:09] <%chosenjuan42> you should use stars and let those refill as you do other fights

[3:23:23] <FallenVerto81> woolieFUN woolieGIRLS
[3:23:27] <%SirGO0SE> psaUp psaUp
[3:23:27] <%DensityD> we'll be back
[3:23:30] <snorlaxbud> Super late to stream but hell ya reggie for the maiden shirt, that was a sick tour
[3:23:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:23:36] <%Koover> oh man I can't wait
[3:23:44] <@Menitta> Yes. The Touhou GIFG that everyone expected
[3:23:55] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta highly demanded
[3:24:10] <@Menitta> Everyone Rumored, Nobody Believed
[3:24:26] <prime_name> That's a good mindset to have.
[3:24:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> I assume this will escalate and fucking go places
[3:24:43] <%RyTYoung> World's will collide even more...
[3:24:49] <Polarix64> This game goes some places and it's really cool
[3:24:50] <Louie_Salmon> Things will happen, that's my theory
[3:24:57] <RunoEddie> oh shit I just realized Reggie is wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt, nice
[3:25:25] <SomersaultJustice> use the turtles
[3:25:29] <slinkietv> why is woolie wearing the frank sinatra anime robo guy
[3:25:50] <%SirGO0SE> i had some issues connecting last time, going to try and iron those out now
[3:26:02] <%heartlesshealer> OH
[3:26:05] <%RyTYoung> Sounds like a blast
[3:26:07] <%heartlesshealer> that one
[3:26:15] <time_axis> it's funny that I have to avoid that for spoilers
[3:26:17] <%pectusumbra> Man I thought that was literally higurashi vs Touhou and I almost got hype as fuck
[3:26:49] <%SirGO0SE> as a developer i dont see anything wrong with it
[3:27:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SirGO0SE But as a Publisher?
[3:27:19] <%SirGO0SE> bingo
[3:27:20] <nyacoo> Remember companies complained about Nvidia Gefore NOw
[3:27:34] <CirclesForever> sharing is caring, but caring cuts into profit margins so we must shut it down
[3:27:35] <%KaitlynnHere> @WoolieVersus say the thing!
[3:27:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Working remotely right now
[3:27:38] <RunoEddie> man that is some kusoge
