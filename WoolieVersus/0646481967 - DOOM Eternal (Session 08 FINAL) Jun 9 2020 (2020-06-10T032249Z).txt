[0:04:28] <%Asuterisuku> If you play blue, your objective is to make the other person not play the game.
[0:04:29] <+jiggy_snipe> the card game archetypes can apply to fighting game players too

[0:06:50] <NekoZen> everybody who isnt a professional is a spike
[0:06:50] <Hydrapissed> the net decker spike
[0:06:51] <+zetastriker> I think my favorite combo I found was a few cards that removed all basic land from the opponent's deck.
[0:07:01] <+tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 yep
[0:07:02] <pennykettle_> Can these archetypes be applied to other genres like fighting games

[0:08:44] <%VidulaSaix> I'm definitely a Mel then
[0:08:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Vorthos likes lore
[0:08:46] <%Double_Tap_That> You're looking at one, Reg
[0:08:53] <+jiggy_snipe> lol the Reggie
[0:08:56] <+tearfuldevil> i'm timmy/mel/vorthos
[0:08:59] <fuji_92> mel is card design and interactions, and volthos is lore
[0:09:05] <pennykettle_> Vorthos gang
[0:09:06] <%Neoepochx> If you play an eternal format you can get away with playing with same deck for ever. at least until 2019 happened.
[0:09:07] <+jiggy_snipe> the Woolie KappaHD
[0:09:11] <Ozmodyas> Melvin is about pure mechanics vs Vorthos pure lore/flavor
[0:09:11] <+ItsCaptainDisco> What are we talking about?
[0:09:28] <+ggbhtg> Vorthos was Lorethos, right?
[0:09:29] <%r0chelimit> Hey woolz any chance we could see more space opera rpg goodness when you’re done with KOTOR with a mass effect LP?
[0:09:34] <%Shishi1205> correct
[0:09:36] <lotharrio> Yeah! Vorthus!
[0:09:37] <mdkcde> That's Flavor
[0:09:40] <pennykettle_> Vorthos loves flavor.
[0:09:48] <fuji_92> volthos is woolthos
[0:09:54] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the original article on wotc website only has Timmy, Johnny, and Spike, Mel and Vorthos were added by someone
[0:09:55] <jerichotrump> Yugioh?
[0:09:57] <%emperordread> How does Dark Magician Girl fit into the Yu-Gi-Oh lore?
[0:10:00] <mdkcde> When the card lore reflect the mecanic it is called "Good Flavor"
[0:10:01] <fuji_92> *vorthos
[0:10:01] <+jiggy_snipe> we're talking about the Magic the Gathering player archetypes
[0:10:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Vorthos likes what the mechanics imply in lore. The favor. Mel is about functions.
[0:10:04] <lotharrio> System design was one of them.
[0:10:05] <Ozmodyas> Vorthos is about lore implementation, Melvin is only concerned with function vs function
[0:10:05] <+Superbro64> I suggest reading the -actual- magic the gathering article on these archetypes woolie
[0:10:09] <Shwepie> Mel is just, "This art is awesome, into the deck to goes!"
[0:10:13] <%R3Roundabout> Not anesthetics, mechanics

[0:11:49] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersuswoolie, reggie, this stuff comes from a 20008ish article on the MTG website, but the article only has Timmy, Johnny, and Spike (as well as mixtures of them, Timmy/Johnny, Johnny/spike, Timmy/Spike, and Timmy/Johnny/Spike), Mel and Vorthos were added by someone and i've never heard about them before, and i've known about this article for years
[0:11:54] <pennykettle_> I think my favourite card gimmick is when you have cards that the enemy should be afraid of killing. When you kill my monsters, it benefits me.

[0:13:30] <%emperordread> Detroit had NO MESSAGE
[0:13:35] <+jiggy_snipe> Detroit wasn't political tho
[0:13:40] <fuji_92> yeah, but no
[0:13:41] <jevichrono> Detroit Beyond Two Holes was not about anything
[0:13:42] <Chatterbox1991> im totally fine with games being political i just want it to be well done so it has actual meaning behind it. (think Spec Ops The Line)
[0:13:45] <%Shishi1205> For Reggie: Mel is the "mechanic player", someone focused on the craft of Design & Development. A Mel is characterized for appreciating cards with delicate and interesting interactions, as well as strong mechanics
[0:13:45] <%Josef_Stryker> Detroit just wanted to ask questions tho
[0:13:46] <gunsrlove> What did Chatter say again LUL
[0:13:46] <%dekkitout> Detroit was only asking questions
[0:13:47] <%spacehouse> Deus Ex is the best
[0:13:50] <@Solidus_113> chatter pls
[0:13:52] <+tearfuldevil> politics being badwritten in videogames = / = people complaining about any remotely leftist content in videogames
[0:13:53] <+ItsCaptainDisco> Remember "We Have A Dream" was not political
[0:13:55] <%DesertPenguin> Socio-political is the correct term
[0:14:00] <+kewlmyc> THANK YOU
[0:14:01] <%DesertPenguin> Socio is the important party
[0:14:04] <derap41> Its not a political issue its a moral one
[0:14:06] <@Commando_Joe> They want EQUALITY. How much lower can your demands be? @WoolieVersus
[0:14:07] <+tearfuldevil> human rights ARE POLITICAL
[0:14:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:14:13] <pillowwasp> People never complained about Bioshock. People just don’t like race stuff because they are weak
[0:14:15] <+tearfuldevil> thats what politics are woolie
[0:14:17] <%Mrbaconator> those are political tho
[0:14:17] <%DesertPenguin> Geo-cultural might apply as well
[0:14:17] <akman14> But woolie, what if i want to kill all humans?
[0:14:28] <derap41> Look at Terry Crews Twitter Poor guy
[0:14:35] <+vaporousTippler> They shouldn't be political. But sadly, they are.
[0:14:46] <%VidulaSaix> terry got attacked over some crazy dumb shit. People latch onto 1 word and ignore everything else
[0:14:51] <+kewlmyc> "We don't want to keep getting killed unjustly by cops." What a political stance... sbfpBleetz
[0:14:53] <%dekkitout> I see that you don't like a burning house, but please don't call the burning house next door a mere "inconvience"
[0:14:53] <%gatorafan> Is Woolie on the list yet? Kappa
[0:15:01] <%wrightlight94> Poor Terry crews doyCry
[0:15:03] <%seduwu> Woolie is on the list
[0:15:04] <+tearfuldevil> @vaporousTippler ????? do you think that politicians shouldn't be campaigning based aorund improving human rights?
[0:15:09] <+ggbhtg> *sighs*, Mike Z.....of all the times.....I guess Skullgirls will never be a real girl
[0:15:11] <jevichrono> Woolie is on the List
[0:15:12] <%DesertPenguin> Something can be political and also not "get" political?
[0:15:14] <%gatorafan> waow
[0:15:19] <derap41> Whatabout ?
[0:15:21] <@Commando_Joe> "Guys what about black on black crime?" <- a thing I read today
[0:15:22] <+vaporousTippler> I think it's stupid they have to, @tearfuldevil it should be a given.
[0:15:31] <%seduwu> goddamn it Mike Z
[0:15:33] <fuji_92> fucking whataboutism
[0:15:45] <DaKnightWarrior> Mike Z is not racist he's just dumb.
[0:15:47] <pennykettle_> I think human rights are very political, maybe the distinction should be that human rights shouldn't be partisan. All sides of the political spectrum should agree that black lives matter
[0:15:49] <Arth__> woolie describing the gop/conservative media/the wh?
[0:15:50] <%Shishi1205> You can see the trash that seeps from behind some of those comments
[0:15:54] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus That's the Republican way, sadly. Deflect and downplay.
[0:15:55] <%VidulaSaix> Mike "Not Enough Time Passed" Z LUL
[0:15:56] <Dova573> Exactly at least be honest why you dont like people saying that people shouldnt get kill by cops
[0:15:56] <PlasticJake> humans are fucking dumb
[0:15:57] <+tearfuldevil> @vaporousTippler thats fair i guess but they aren't and won't be until we change things, and doing so is political
[0:15:58] <%doomerskeletor13> All my homies hate whataboutism
[0:16:12] <+vaporousTippler> If a political party declares the sky to be blue, the other party will find a way to argue about it.
[0:16:20] <fuji_92> "this crime is bad yes, but what about this crime" SoonerLater why ppl do this shit
[0:16:22] <%DesertPenguin> Someone said it really well. "Be grateful we're out for equality and not revenge." That shook me to my core
[0:16:31] <LeeOhX> wtf Woolie, that makes too much sense knock that shit off they dont wanna hear it
[0:16:34] <+jiggy_snipe> Mike Z just made a poor joke. I will now call him Mike Gottfried or Gilbert Z
[0:16:41] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus i totally agree
[0:16:42] <megamonmon123> was this whataboutism or was they just bring it up?

[0:16:48] <pillowwasp> They work together against the economic interest of the public by dividing us socially
[0:16:51] <+tearfuldevil> @pennykettle_ i mean, the "political spectrum" includes people whos politics are absed aorund racism and hatred so...
[0:16:56] <+ItsCaptainDisco> Can't wait for people to get upset about Cyberpunk 2077 - from a genre that satirises hypercapitalism & in a game written by someone who's not white
[0:17:08] <+kewlmyc> Human rights versus Cringe in Videogames: One is way more important than the other
[0:17:11] <Dova573> People side with political parties the same way idiots chose a side on "console wars"
[0:17:15] <+ggbhtg> For people who asked about Za List, Roosterteeth is on the list. Therefore, Woolie and Pat are on Za List.
[0:17:15] <koolaid_kevster> Was George Floyd death from racism. Or abuse of power? @woolieversus I need to know
[0:17:17] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Someone said it really well. "Be grateful we're out for equality and not revenge." That shook me to my core
[0:17:24] <%VidulaSaix> @koolaid_kevster Both
[0:17:26] <DaKnightWarrior> both
[0:17:26] <%emperordread> There can be value in a Devil's Advocate. But when it comes to BLM and police brutality - it's SUPER not the time in the light of all the heinous injustice
[0:17:29] <pennykettle_> I'd rather have cringe in videogames if it means black people get human rights lol
[0:17:31] <%dekkitout> @koolaid_kevster Yes
[0:17:32] <pillowwasp> People treat political parties like sports teams
[0:17:33] <+tearfuldevil> @ItsCaptainDisco is CDProjekt working much with Mike Pondsmith?
[0:17:36] <+vaporousTippler> Racism in itself is an abuse of power.
[0:17:36] <Chatterbox1991> i totally understand, thank you.
[0:17:37] <%Shishi1205> We can live with the cringe, We need to change the situation with real life first

[0:21:11] <%DesertPenguin> With Pat doing a DS3 Cinders LP, it would be cool to see Woolie go through DS3 Vanilla all by himself without Pat's help

[0:49:31] <%Neoepochx> It isn't that big a deal
[0:49:35] <%Neoepochx> He can get it later with FT
[0:49:45] <pennykettle_> the shade of crimson red in the pit is beautiful
[0:49:56] <ghostspartan80> eh you got all you need right now any how
[0:49:58] <%Asuterisuku> Box was punched to get there, Legacy, it can't be punched anymore.
[0:50:04] <+dmtjinni> Woolz & Reggie
[0:50:04] <Who_lio42> secret behind
[0:50:12] <peachy996> All the red is a nice Rose color
[0:50:27] <%BinaryFireball> archvile is the worst
[0:50:31] <%Asuterisuku> Two secrets in the coffidor you just came through.
[0:50:35] <ghostspartan80> get that ice bomb ready
[0:50:40] <+maenos2> you could say it is vile
[0:50:49] <%BinaryFireball> arch...vile
[0:50:51] <venomfury86> Woolie loves the super shotgun a little too much
[0:50:52] <%HitchhikingThrough> aww yeah just in time for heaven
[0:50:53] <%Asuterisuku> ... Wow I messed up typing that.
[0:50:59] <pennykettle_> Archville, USA is a Beach Boys song i think
[0:50:59] <%a_goth_pancake> Arch Ville was my favorite Facebook clicker game.
[0:51:00] <%arcielardor> welcome to Archville
[0:51:02] <ghostspartan80> hipster archvile should be in the campaign
[0:51:07] <LeeOhX> did woolie get the glory kill from the back on those spider demons? cause is hilarious
[0:51:11] <+zetastriker> Mmmm, blood punching the teleporting imps feels so good. Usually staggers into glory, into a new blood punch.
[0:51:21] <%Asuterisuku> It could also be a Revenant, but yeah, that's the Hunter there.
[0:51:23] <%HitchhikingThrough> and god damn is woolie hitting headshots on the drones consistantly? pogChamp
[0:51:29] <@Solidus_113> nice dashes
[0:51:32] <ghostspartan80> nice
[0:51:32] <+dmtjinni> I love the WoolieVS Show
[0:51:33] <Who_lio42> CHUMPED
[0:51:34] <%therabbles> my eyes cannot process this information
[0:51:44] <Louie_Salmon> The random punches are doing the real damage here
[0:51:44] <rytisone> circle strafe until it's done
[0:51:46] <+Mkingston> Archville's scared the shit out of me when I first saw them. I grew up on the PS1 version of Doom so when I played it on PC they were a shock.
[0:51:48] <%Javaa01> These drones keep you FED if you hit your shots
[0:51:51] <+UltraKrysis> Is this Hurt Me Plenty?
[0:51:54] <%Asuterisuku> Drones are technically Fodder, but they take three pips to Chainsaw.
[0:51:57] <%Asuterisuku> This is HMP, yes.
[0:51:58] <ghostspartan80> you'll be ready for ultra nightmare in no time
[0:52:01] <%Javaa01> Staying at max health is not an issue in Urdak
[0:52:03] <cocobody> Woolie is SO much agile than I was with the Super Shotgun. I'm jealous
[0:52:04] <venomfury86> it's sad that you can't use the enemy skins in the campaign
[0:52:21] <mark_collins45> Look at these pro strats. You're the fucking boss now Woolie.
[0:52:22] <pennykettle_> venomfury86 IKR? it feels so pointless otherwise.
[0:52:23] <%Asuterisuku> I don't think the player skins for demons have damage models though.
[0:52:28] <%rosemon5001> i hope the betrayer dlc is him meeting satan
[0:52:29] <%LynbellDaYo> tea kettle
[0:52:31] <%therabbles> Mick has not left
[0:52:36] <+zetastriker> I'm still on the anime aside from today, did Woolie ever play around with the minigun shield mod and dashing into enemies?
[0:52:37] <%Asuterisuku> Secrets behind you, Woolie!
[0:52:41] <+zetastriker> Seemed like something he'd like
[0:52:41] <%a_goth_pancake> sexcellent.
[0:52:43] <+UltraKrysis> I can tell by the amount of damage.
[0:52:44] <pennykettle_> does this universe actually have a big bad satan?
[0:52:51] <Who_lio42> big up
[0:52:52] <Tha_Mik> maybe
[0:52:52] <peachy996> and the choir fades out
[0:52:53] <%doomerskeletor13> Yes
[0:52:55] <%LynbellDaYo> probably
[0:52:56] <%HitchhikingThrough> maybeeee?
[0:52:59] <%doomerskeletor13> The Dark Lord
[0:53:15] <%Asuterisuku> That's not a cookie.
[0:53:19] <%a_goth_pancake> his name is John Romero and he's dead
[0:53:23] <%VidulaSaix> LOOOORE
[0:53:23] <pennykettle_> hell's lore seems kind of weak after Urdak being pushed as the main evil, so a unique SATAN might help
[0:53:25] <@Solidus_113> biiiiiiitch
[0:53:28] <pennykettle_> biiiiitch
[0:53:29] <peachy996> lore is importan in urdak

[0:54:44] <Solidnick18> oh
[0:54:45] <+zetastriker> Where's daddy?
[0:54:46] <%Javaa01> Somebody made a big oopsie, wonder who could have fucked up like that
[0:54:49] <+zetastriker> We need daddy.
[0:54:51] <%Neoepochx> Seraphim never "asked" Kappa
[0:54:53] <%doomerskeletor13> The Father went out for a cigarette
[0:54:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> ssssh, don't wake daddy
[0:54:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> you ever just S T E A L God?
[0:54:58] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:54:59] <pennykettle_> the khan has daddy issues
[0:55:05] <Hanstelgotto> ATTACK AND STEAL GOD
[0:55:07] <+santafer> KHAAN
[0:55:08] <%Shishi1205> YOINK your god BITCH
[0:55:10] <pillowwasp> Stupid aliens
[0:55:11] <%superc37> yes
[0:55:14] <megamonmon123> I wonder who the father is? Kappa
[0:55:15] <%dekkitout> Yes to both?
[0:55:18] <%therabbles> where's pappy
[0:55:28] <Nested_Dreams> Inb4 she told Seraphim to steal the Father
[0:55:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah, just five finger discount God, ya know, as you do
[0:55:34] <ralphfromdk> Actually, she's doing the bullshit because she is the last one. She needs argent to live, because some one else *cough* sam *cough* stole the father
[0:55:35] <+spinalwizard> Steal half of god!
[0:55:36] <%Atomik456> or did the fsather go missing and she became shit cause she couldn;'t handle doing all the stuff the fasther was doing as well
[0:55:39] <megamonmon123> mastery token
[0:55:44] <peachy996> you still would, reggie
[0:55:48] <%Asuterisuku> Tell us how you really feel, Reggie.
[0:55:53] <megamonmon123> its not a cookie, its a super cookie
[0:55:54] <pennykettle_> or maybe all lore entries are propaganda
[0:55:58] <Who_lio42> its back in the hole you came from before this room
[0:56:02] <%a_goth_pancake> if Romero is the devil, does that make Carmack God?
[0:56:13] <Nested_Dreams> Right, it's a feet-less species
[0:56:14] <venomfury86> mastery cookie
[0:56:15] <arkv01> the khan makyr got those karen vibes
[0:56:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> I'd guess the previous room based on the map
[0:56:16] <%Javaa01> Gotta go backwards further
[0:56:17] <%Neoepochx> The room before this one.
[0:56:18] <ralphfromdk> Nested_Dreams Nope, Sam did that on his own accord because he wants to be in charge and needs her dead, but she's staying alive with argent
[0:56:23] <megamonmon123> its the previous room
[0:56:25] <Saltmeisterr> no romero is the icon of sin
[0:56:42] <Kragular> activate your stand!
[0:56:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:56:48] <%Asuterisuku> Look up.
[0:56:58] <%Neoepochx> Behind the column on the right.
[0:57:00] <Nested_Dreams> @ralphfromdk Did lore ever explain how Sam was able to disobey Maykr?
[0:57:00] <%Javaa01> Yeah, they kinda stop bothering to hide these very well, cause they obviously want you to have ALL the masteries by the next level
[0:57:01] <+tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 you think mfing ID SOFTWARE gives a fuck about protests
[0:57:02] <ghostspartan80> to the side maybe
[0:57:09] <@Solidus_113> YEAH
[0:57:10] <%Josef_Stryker> RIP AND TEAR
[0:57:11] <%VidulaSaix> Sneaky little secret
[0:57:12] <Solidnick18> YEAH
[0:57:14] <%Asuterisuku> _RIP and TEAR_
[0:57:14] <Kragular> You put your right hand in....
[0:57:20] <venomfury86> RIP AND TEAR
[0:57:21] <%HitchhikingThrough> THAT MEANS YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS
[0:57:32] <%a_goth_pancake> RIP AND TEAR
[0:57:33] <%Asuterisuku> I think that's the one that spawns in the room with the 2016 Praetor suit.
[0:57:34] <arkv01> I mean it's also a lot more fun to just say the bible isn't canon and the real dark lord is something else
[0:57:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> LUL
[0:57:36] <ralphfromdk> Nested_Dreams Nope, but he was her right hand man, so if any one could, it was him.
[0:57:36] <rytisone> they're action figures Kappa
[0:57:38] <LeeOhX> very nice
[0:57:40] <megamonmon123> gg
[0:57:40] <+tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 while it is different people, it is still ID SOFTWARE, the company that made the original doom
[0:57:43] <FeelinNifty> wip and teaw
[0:57:54] <ghostspartan80> doom guy collects funkos
[0:57:59] <arkv01> *tweah
[0:58:03] <pennykettle_> OwO *nuzzles your super shotgun*
[0:58:07] <bepna> i wish more games had koopy sandwiches
[0:58:23] <Hanstelgotto> Can't believe that Doom retconned the bible
[0:58:24] <@Solidus_113> SWORD
[0:58:25] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:58:27] <venomfury86> Descent from Cerberon best theme
[0:58:32] <%Javaa01> Ehh, it's just a Baron
[0:58:38] <%Javaa01> You can melt his ass no problem
[0:58:44] <rytisone> knock knock open up the door
[0:58:45] <0rond> OH LAWD HE RUNNIN
[0:58:45] <+zetastriker> Barons were the weakest Super Heavy, for sure
[0:58:48] <mark_collins45> Oh lawd!
[0:58:50] <snakest3alth> USE THE CRUCIBLE
[0:58:57] <%Neoepochx> Chaingun for staggerse
[0:59:04] <%a_goth_pancake> chaingun
[0:59:06] <ghostspartan80> chaingun for days
[0:59:08] <arkv01> oh LAWD HE COMIN
[0:59:16] <zyzytheboss> hi
[0:59:17] <Who_lio42> no chaingun SSG ONLY
[0:59:19] <megamonmon123> woolie likes the super shotgun a bit too much
[0:59:22] <%Asuterisuku> That's not the first time they threw a single Baron at you and called it an encounter.
[0:59:25] <ralphfromdk> turret mode on the chaingun was made for that kind of dude
[0:59:26] <%a_goth_pancake> it's hilarious, he literally can't move
[0:59:28] <pennykettle_> Okay this game may be slightly divisive but can we agree that the knife doomguy uses made all the glory kills lazier
[0:59:37] <peachy996> SSG is love SSG is life
[0:59:40] <@Solidus_113> oh, this part
[0:59:41] <Hanstelgotto> The theme of baron glory kills, is neck slitting
[0:59:42] <+YabbaTroll> yeah some of them
[0:59:48] <Who_lio42> not woolz fault SSG is stupid gppd
[0:59:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @VidulaSaix
[0:59:49] <%RangeCraft> damn... as a long time anime watcher and a first time manga watcher .... your skill has for sure improved
[0:59:49] <alphalejandro> Red sakuras?
[0:59:49] <%HitchhikingThrough> something about the way demons run into the rooms in this game is fucking hilarious. Every time I see a marauder run in from halfway across the map I lose my shit.
[0:59:50] <Who_lio42> good
[0:59:52] <%Asuterisuku> Aaaah, he said the thing.
[0:59:53] <%LynbellDaYo> THE ICON OF sIN GROWs MORE POWERFULL
[0:59:53] <FeelinNifty> heh heh he said the line!!!!
[0:59:55] <%Asuterisuku> Look down, Woolie.
[0:59:55] <megamonmon123> he said the meme
[0:59:56] <pennykettle_> the icon of sing grows more powerful the longer he is on earth
[0:59:57] <Hanstelgotto> So stronk
[0:59:58] <LeeOhX> More powerful eh
[1:00:03] <%Shishi1205> The icon of sin grows more powerful the longer he is on earth
[1:00:04] <Saltmeisterr> take a sip boys
[1:00:10] <Nested_Dreams> A good part of blade gory kills isn't gorey enough
[1:00:12] <Tha_Mik> sigh
[1:00:14] <%a_goth_pancake> don't want that, do we? Kappa
[1:00:20] <mdkcde> Remember, The Longer the Icon of Sin is on Earth, the stronger it becomes
[1:00:24] <+dmtjinni> i swear these streams bring me comfort
[1:00:42] <Nested_Dreams> I want to see the baron's head dangling after that slash
[1:01:00] <%Asuterisuku> You won't have enough Weapon points to finish everything until about half way through the final level.
[1:01:01] <pennykettle_> I dont use remote detonate but the attachement looks so much cooler. why does a rocket launcher need a chain
[1:01:04] <ghostspartan80> the next doom will obviously be a visual novel
[1:01:17] <arkv01> @ghostspartan80 it will be now
[1:01:22] <Tha_Mik> Next doom is gonna be a mobile rpg, oh wait
[1:01:23] <+maenos2> rip and tear senpai
[1:01:28] <%a_goth_pancake> I'm down, give me my demon dating sim
[1:01:34] <mark_collins45> Remote detonation is neat but I never used it.
[1:01:34] <Who_lio42> it was prob better to avoid the headache w media and just use DARK LORD instead of a set name like satan
[1:01:34] <insaneintentionsyo> yo
[1:01:39] <%LynbellDaYo> DOOM gacha
[1:01:42] <%Asuterisuku> Microwave beam is kind of useless unpatched.
[1:01:45] <hattrick61> You don't like symetra?
[1:01:49] <%Javaa01> Explosive Array is surprisingly good for taking out weak spots in groups, and generally just getting rid of imps
[1:01:49] <%HitchhikingThrough> @a_goth_pancake play Helltaker
[1:01:56] <Solidnick18> WOO
[1:01:57] <Saltmeisterr> probs same reason why god is called the father
[1:02:02] <@Solidus_113> nyooooom
[1:02:02] <ralphfromdk> Tha_Mik With Bethesda in charge, it might just fucking be one :l
[1:02:02] <ghostspartan80> HDoom will somehow be a part of the canon
[1:02:18] <pennykettle_> isnt HDoom already canon
[1:02:21] <Who_lio42> I only liked Lock on for bosses, otherwise remote det was super good imo
[1:02:32] <%a_goth_pancake> almost had some speed running tech going on there
[1:02:43] <@Solidus_113> THE BOY

[1:02:56] <%VidulaSaix> It's the MAD LAD
[1:02:58] <Nested_Dreams> Remote detonation is a viable marauder opener
[1:03:01] <Hanstelgotto> FOOLISHNESS
[1:03:01] <pennykettle_> how it feels to chew 5 gum

[1:03:55] <ghostspartan80> man a sword fight with the marauder would be sick
[1:03:55] <+zetastriker> After a while I just started doing super shotgun into BFG to instant gib them.
[1:03:56] <%a_goth_pancake> of course woolie gets all nervous when his crush shows up
[1:03:58] <%fist_wizard_jay> Woolie what the fuck
[1:03:58] <%arcielardor> Woolie came for Doom but decided to play KOTOR
[1:03:58] <%rosemon5001> i wonder if you get the marauder in a glory kill situation could you chainsaw him?
[1:03:59] <Who_lio42> I like the Ice nade tech WAY better for them now
[1:04:04] <ralphfromdk> aaaaand lore
[1:04:05] <Saltmeisterr> BIG LORE COMING
[1:04:12] <megamonmon123> regular shotgun still.useful

[1:04:17] <%Shishi1205> he is inmune
[1:04:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WILL WE?
[1:04:21] <megamonmon123> nope
[1:04:23] <%Javaa01> Nope, you can't sword the Marauder
[1:04:26] <%Javaa01> He has a shield
[1:04:29] <%Javaa01> He will use it
[1:04:33] <LeeOhX> *sweats in massive Lore*
[1:04:35] <unit24> you technically can if you can stagger him for long enough
[1:04:43] <%fist_wizard_jay> We wuz Slayers n shiet
[1:04:43] <Who_lio42> sticky bombs were my baby, I was made when my game bugged and took them away from me
[1:04:47] <%LynbellDaYo> i think you can monkey bar up there or something
[1:04:49] <unit24> it's just tough and not really worth it
[1:04:50] <%VidulaSaix> YES REGGIE
[1:04:53] <%VidulaSaix> I LOVE THAT SONG LUL
[1:04:54] <ghostspartan80> I think you can glitch it fast enough to crucible him maybe
[1:04:59] <%Neoepochx> You can make that.
[1:05:00] <Hanstelgotto> Man the cool Maruader glory kill made me jump out my seat, too bad no one ever gets it
[1:05:04] <lotharrio> Don't you sing those devil songs, Reggie!
[1:05:04] <%Javaa01> It's totally doable
[1:05:04] <phantalime> swing

[1:05:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Reggie yes
[1:05:05] <%rosemon5001> swing maybe
[1:05:09] <Saltmeisterr> theres a monkie bar

[1:15:20] <hattrick61> ye
[1:15:25] <%Ashenik1> IDK why but these lady humming reminds me of Orochimaru theme
[1:15:27] <Make_me_mad> Oh wait, that wasn't the same room I was thinking of.
[1:15:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> ok cool
[1:15:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Urdak is rad
[1:15:30] <arkv01> ScaredyCat eternal torment
[1:15:30] <%Javaa01> You hooked onto the zombie behind him
[1:15:33] <%HitchhikingThrough> you chainsawed a different dude
[1:15:34] <@Solidus_113> there's the combo
[1:15:36] <%Klefth> Piñata time
[1:15:38] <%Asuterisuku> Grenades are strong.
[1:15:41] <%VidulaSaix> LOORE
[1:15:47] <+zetastriker> I wish those guys got to do something.
[1:15:49] <+YabbaTroll> man why cant we fight those guys?
[1:15:52] <%Asuterisuku> Reggie it was actually no resources, grenades and flame blast are free.
[1:15:54] <%DesertPenguin> Was just outside for awhile. Last I saw they found Rip And Tear secret muisc
[1:15:58] <ghostspartan80> Steve Blum angel?
[1:15:59] <venomfury86> Welcome home Slayer
[1:16:02] <%HitchhikingThrough> you can't fight these fucks because this game S U C K S
[1:16:03] <$jaxondorf> the Demons are filled with C A N D Y
[1:16:03] <Make_me_mad> It feels like they just forgot to put these guys in the game.
[1:16:09] <%DesertPenguin> They didn't get far right? just some lore reading?
[1:16:11] <DelgotHansto> cut enemies for sure
[1:16:11] <%Javaa01> Nah, it was Drones that got corrupted
[1:16:15] <Nested_Dreams> Worker bees lore
[1:16:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh did Steve Blum voice them?
[1:16:27] <venomfury86> Bianco Angelo
[1:16:28] <peachy996> @DesertPenguin we got to the vega part
[1:16:30] <ghostspartan80> sounded like it
[1:16:34] <%DesertPenguin> NOOOOOOOOOOOO I missed it!!!!
[1:16:39] <+zetastriker> Maybe we'll get them in the DLC, I hope
[1:16:41] <%DesertPenguin> Did he get it right away or just more questions?
[1:16:49] <%Shishi1205> he suspected it
[1:16:49] <pennykettle_> I want angels to be horrifically scary to contemplate and look at
[1:16:49] <rytisone> Doomguy feels like a fucking celebrity in Urdak
[1:16:51] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s very Bayonetta
[1:16:57] <peachy996> Woolie had a suspicion, Reggie was surprised
[1:17:01] <DelgotHansto> @desertpenguin we also had a crash which was fun
[1:17:09] <%DesertPenguin> Thanks y'all
[1:17:10] <%Shishi1205> go back there
[1:17:15] <%a_goth_pancake> just wait woolz
[1:17:16] <%doomerskeletor13> They’re like the angels in the book of Revelations, Eldritch looking
[1:17:19] <ghostspartan80> oh boi you'll see those makyrs up close for sure
[1:17:19] <%Shishi1205> there's a cool dude near that extra life
[1:17:40] <Raldavar> Nothing beats old biblical descriptions of angels
[1:17:47] <%Asuterisuku> Left or right, Woolie?
[1:17:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:02] <mark_collins45> THIS MUSIC!
[1:18:05] <%DesertPenguin> What's your favorite classic video game "thing" from this game? The Mario fire wheels? The literal 1-Ups?
[1:18:06] <%Javaa01> Gotta take a jump pad
[1:18:07] <%Klefth> Man, this is one Warframe ass Warframe level if I've ever seen one
[1:18:12] <%a_goth_pancake> left first, it's a shorter path
[1:18:19] <%Asuterisuku> Mick's ambience is really getting pushed here.
[1:18:27] <ghostspartan80> some Urdak tracks remind me of Blade Runner 2049
[1:18:27] <%DesertPenguin> This was tough without aerial mobility LUL
[1:18:28] <pennykettle_> the longer the icon of sin is on earth
[1:18:29] <%doomerskeletor13> I loved the platforming and how unapologetically weird it was
[1:18:32] <%gatorafan> @klefth Khan Maykr can't Vorpost
[1:18:33] <%Asuterisuku> Last secret mission nearby.
[1:18:35] <DatAsuna> we knew that sam
[1:18:38] <%VidulaSaix> "Fuck Heaven" Reggie 2020
[1:18:44] <+YabbaTroll> isnt it samur's ?
[1:18:45] <%LynbellDaYo> it's sam's
[1:18:46] <pennykettle_> is it? she had no choice
[1:18:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> and Sams
[1:18:48] <spidervenomized> it was sam
[1:18:49] <%VidulaSaix> It's Sams lol
[1:18:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Fuck them angels
[1:18:50] <peachy996> It's...kinda his
[1:18:51] <Raldavar> Wheel with 3 heads, wings out of every corner, tentacles, and the whole thing is on fire
[1:18:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Fuck them angels" - Michael Jordan
[1:19:01] <spidervenomized> sam took god from them
[1:19:09] <%Shishi1205> he is "trapped" in your ship now anyway
[1:19:12] <venomfury86> it happened after Samur stole The Father
[1:19:13] <TheHardM> It's the Seraphim's fault. He took the father and made the Maykers vulnerable to Transfiguration.
[1:19:13] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this is Samuel's fuckup we're cleaning up
[1:19:13] <gunsrlove> Did Sam taking the Father cause the Transfiguration tho, i forget if that was mentioned in the lore
[1:19:15] <%a_goth_pancake> challengee behind
[1:19:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Well she did that after the Father was stolen
[1:19:17] <%Asuterisuku> Look back, Woolie, Secret Mission!
[1:19:18] <mark_collins45> Sam Hayden, S Hayden, Satan
[1:19:20] <%DesertPenguin> Why does it take so long to get 2 Blood Punch charges?
[1:19:23] <megamonmon123> this is mission 12 correct?
[1:19:27] <%a_goth_pancake> outside to the left
[1:19:28] <pennykettle_> I hate that 2016's hell skull switches are now just in every dimension in Eternal
[1:19:29] <ghostspartan80> Samur literally stole God
[1:19:30] <Who_lio42> im glad SKULL SWITCH (tm) tech is universal
[1:19:33] <+YabbaTroll> she needs the argent to not die, and she dont wanna die cause samur took her rebirth shit right?
[1:19:38] <@Solidus_113> slayer gates are done
[1:19:38] <peachy996> Sam took god away before the Kahn Maykr exiled him for giving Doomguy the powerup
[1:19:39] <Solidnick18> yeah just gore nests
[1:19:41] <%gatorafan> Sam continues to poopoo fart all over the universe
[1:19:47] <%Asuterisuku> You might wanna BFG this one.
[1:19:47] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s also a demon who was formerly an angel named Samael
[1:19:48] <mark_collins45> this one sucked
[1:19:52] <+akikyou> Sam with the YOINK
[1:19:52] <%a_goth_pancake> good luck woolz sbfpLiam
[1:19:55] <%rosemon5001> is the pool room soon?
[1:20:03] <ghostspartan80> Sam with the 4d chess plays
[1:20:04] <megamonmon123> gg
[1:20:04] <%VidulaSaix> Nice
[1:20:05] <%Shishi1205> GG
[1:20:06] <@Solidus_113> THE SHIELD
[1:20:06] <%Asuterisuku> Handled.
[1:20:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> gg
[1:20:07] <+YabbaTroll> yoooo that shield
[1:20:07] <Tha_Mik> ez
[1:20:07] <%SuperKirby24> nice
[1:20:10] <mark_collins45> EZ
[1:20:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Clap
[1:20:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> bodied
[1:20:18] <%LynbellDaYo> transfiguration is just a natural thing to them, with the father gone though, the next khan maykr can't be made
[1:20:18] <Make_me_mad> Sam took the father, which messed up the Maykr's reincarnation thing, which meant they turned into weird ass demons as time went on unless they fueled themselves with Argent energy. So basically Sam caused all of this.
[1:20:20] <%a_goth_pancake> fucking nice
[1:20:27] <ghostspartan80> you can shoot shield at guya
[1:20:29] <%DesertPenguin> Shield is great
[1:20:30] <Nested_Dreams> PogChamp
[1:20:33] <%Neoepochx> The shield launch is pretty good
[1:20:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shield is great
[1:20:42] <%doomerskeletor13> Shield was infiltrated by hydra
[1:20:44] <venomfury86> i'm surprised the final challenge didn't include the Marauder
[1:20:45] <@Solidus_113> there's a circle that fills around the reticle
[1:20:46] <%DesertPenguin> Shield is great. Shield.
[1:20:48] <rytisone> embrace overwatch
[1:20:48] <%a_goth_pancake> this fight sucks on UV. doom hunters in small rooms is no bueno
[1:20:49] <$jaxondorf> that Gattling gun is a PROBLEM SOLVER
[1:20:50] <Zebroneath> Shield launch guarantees a flinch
[1:20:52] <ghostspartan80> shield bash
[1:21:12] <%Javaa01> You should be sitting on shield at this point, the shield launch makes up for the loss of DPS compared to Turret Mode, without the absurd ammo waste
[1:21:15] <pennykettle_> The timeline is confusing me, did Sam fuck them over before or after the Maykrs fucked with the Sentinels
[1:21:26] <mark_collins45> I'm under the impression that Doomguy still thinks that Sam is human and that's why he hasn't killed him yet.
[1:21:31] <%Asuterisuku> Incoming fuck room.
[1:21:36] <dinnydanny777> Are we at Demonic style yet
[1:21:36] <%Javaa01> Because Turret Mode is built to waste all your ammo
[1:21:38] <Hal10k> The ability to freely trade hits in this game shouldn't be underestimated
[1:21:40] <ghostspartan80> fuck this room
[1:21:50] <%doomerskeletor13> @pennykettle_ Sam stole the Father which in turn forced them to turn to Argent energy to solve their problems
[1:21:51] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this room is a problem
[1:21:52] <%a_goth_pancake> m i s s
[1:22:00] <Solidnick18> nice
[1:22:00] <+YabbaTroll> QUICKSCOPE
[1:22:04] <%DesertPenguin> 360
[1:22:05] <ghostspartan80> two big boys AND a snek
[1:22:10] <Solidnick18> yeah from the headshot
[1:22:10] <%Klefth> Actual quickscope
[1:22:15] <%a_goth_pancake> buncha sneks
[1:22:17] <TheHardM> Oof.
[1:22:17] <dinnydanny777> Wow this room looks rough
[1:22:19] <Solidnick18> Oof
[1:22:20] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[1:22:21] <%DesertPenguin> You got too close to the Mancubus. They have a really annoying AOE
[1:22:24] <ghostspartan80> BFG
[1:22:25] <%Asuterisuku> Never stop moving.
[1:22:32] <Make_me_mad> Okay I think this is the room I was thinking of earlier, that felt like the hardest thing in the game.
[1:22:37] <%doomerskeletor13> This area took me a bit
[1:22:44] <peachy996> This is the room that eats you if you get cornered
[1:22:46] <%alpacasintophats> full health and full ammo from head shots on those maykr
[1:22:47] <%a_goth_pancake> ABCDA; Always Be Clapping Demon Ass
[1:23:00] <Raldavar> Turret mode triples your dps without lowering damage per bullet. There is no waste
[1:23:00] <%LynbellDaYo> samur gave doomguy the fuck off powers during a hell invasion, so i'm thinking he didn't steal the father until then
[1:23:02] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus, you can make the HUD bigger. That will help a lot
[1:23:11] <+zetastriker> Woolie really is way better with his movement here than where the the anime is.
[1:23:14] <%Asuterisuku> Huh. Makyr Drones count as flying? I didn't know that.
[1:23:18] <peachy996> Samur timeline isn't 100% clear
[1:23:33] <%Asuterisuku> His aim's getting better too.
[1:23:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> and tlhey dont STOP coming and they dont stop coming and they dont stop coming
[1:23:34] <Who_lio42> think of the chaingun as a waterhose, good for people on fire
[1:23:34] <venomfury86> i love the sound of the Arbalest before it explodes
[1:23:36] <Solidnick18> Cooombo
[1:23:37] <%VidulaSaix> PogChamp
[1:23:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Well he stole the Father when he left, so it had to be after he gave Doomguy the powers
[1:23:44] <@Solidus_113> ANOTHA ONE
[1:23:45] <rytisone> Baron is such a poser
[1:23:46] <metabot64> wat is woolie playing this on
[1:23:49] <%Asuterisuku> Baron number 2
[1:23:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Hmp
[1:23:53] <RunningNGunning> We are now in REAL late game
[1:23:57] <ghostspartan80> I kinda hope sam isn't the angel. would be a bit too ridiculous if it all connected like that
[1:23:57] <%Asuterisuku> @metabot64 PS4.
[1:23:57] <%a_goth_pancake> chaingun that mf
[1:23:57] <%VidulaSaix> THIS ROOM doodCrazy
[1:24:02] <%Klefth> Yo Woolie's playing so much better than last time, lol
[1:24:12] <Make_me_mad> Okay, that was not the room.
[1:24:17] <gunsrlove> Yeet
[1:24:18] <pixel_river> this room
[1:24:18] <+YabbaTroll> he's pogging up
[1:24:20] <Tha_Mik> Noice
[1:24:22] <Make_me_mad> The room I was thinking of had Tyrants in it.
[1:24:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie has gotten way better at the game
[1:24:25] <ghostspartan80> one more room
[1:24:26] <akman14> Drones not real enemies LUL
[1:24:28] <RunningNGunning> When I think of Doom E's combat, this is the room I think of
[1:24:28] <%therabbles> the prerequisite ripping and tearing has not been accomplished
[1:24:28] <peachy996> I assumed Sam stole the Father anticipating Khan Maykr exiling him for acting against her will
[1:24:29] <%scrublord009> THE ONLY THINK THEY FEAR IS WOOLIE.mp3
[1:24:31] <pennykettle_> Maykr Drones are fodder enemies like the Zombies, so they arent required for progression
[1:24:33] <%VidulaSaix> EVO Moment 37 of Doom
[1:24:34] <%a_goth_pancake> victory!
[1:24:39] <Mrthefro> My chat is like 1min behind. But just for Woolies channel. Any ideas?
[1:24:43] <SixthSun2> I guess those guys aren't real enemies anymore
[1:24:46] <+SvenHolgersson> HELLO REGGIE oh and I guess Woolie too
[1:24:51] <mark_collins45> I tell you it always happens. The mechanics just click into place and you become a demon grinder.
[1:24:52] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:24:54] <%Asuterisuku> He did die once though.
[1:25:01] <ghostspartan80> they technically just jobbers
[1:25:02] <dinnydanny777> Does playing on easy mode even make this easier when there are so many enemies
[1:25:03] <%a_goth_pancake> sward
[1:25:08] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s been cool seeing Woolie get progressively better at the game
[1:25:10] <+Superbro64> contriarian SeriousSloth
[1:25:11] <venomfury86> Drones are ammo pinatas
[1:25:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> @mrthefro are you on the mobile app?
[1:25:16] <%mitchteck> On uv this room is a nighatmare
[1:25:16] <Solidnick18> get that
[1:25:19] <Solidnick18> woo
[1:25:21] <%Javaa01> Yeah, the enemy layouts in this half of the level are brutal, but the arena layouts are fantastic
[1:25:26] <Solidnick18> one more left
[1:25:27] <%Asuterisuku> Nightmare speaks for itself.
[1:25:30] <mark_collins45> @Mrthefro refresh the feed?
[1:25:30] <mdkcde> How are you liking Devil Will Cry woolie?
[1:25:31] <pixel_river> i know, he got sp much better
[1:25:32] <Who_lio42> he needs to use a tad more weapon variety but its CLICKED
[1:25:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ez
[1:25:34] <ghostspartan80> on nightmare this room sucks monkey fuck
[1:25:50] <+slimmixrp> You think well see the icon today
[1:25:58] <pennykettle_> I forget what the geology is called, but I dig the stacked pancake rocks
[1:26:01] <peachy996> Hard to say
[1:26:10] <LeeOhX> depends on how much of a gamer woolie is
[1:26:10] <%doomerskeletor13> I want a DMC 5 mod where you play as Doomguy in first person
[1:26:11] <+zetastriker> I feel like even on Nightmare I just powered through Urdak's fights. It wasn't until the next level that I started getting stopped again.
[1:26:18] <pennykettle_> eternal...
[1:26:20] <rytisone> yeah, we got that
[1:26:21] <%Javaa01> !NAP AT RISK!
[1:26:21] <Mrthefro> Ps4 . Neve been a problem tho
[1:26:22] <%redrins> never sword got it
[1:26:23] <%Asuterisuku> She did that to herself.
[1:26:23] <Solidnick18> eternal
[1:26:24] <TheHardM> Nice.

[1:29:19] <pennykettle_> you are NOT the father!!
[1:29:24] <ghostspartan80> Vega is GOD
[1:29:25] <rytisone> and Sam wanted to kill him at the end of 20016
[1:29:32] <%Irridium> Vega = God
[1:29:34] <peachy996> Say bye to Vega by the way
[1:29:35] <brachydios777> Vega is literally GOD
[1:29:35] <Shade075> Dr Coomer is a blessing
[1:29:38] <Solidnick18> that's sick
[1:29:38] <TheHardM> Got God on my hard drive.
[1:29:46] <%jaygee303> How do you use GOD, make him forget who he is
[1:29:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lewdskeletor13 Probably a lot-HELLO GORDON! I'M THIRSTY!
[1:29:49] <pennykettle_> Oh yeayeayea right remember that Sam tried to kill god in 2016 and Doomguy was like, imma take this
[1:29:49] <dinnydanny777> Aren't we all supercomputers though, when you think about it
[1:29:51] <%Javaa01> Use God to run at LEAST like 3 instances of Solitaire
[1:29:51] <ghostspartan80> literal Deus Ex Machina
[1:29:57] <hattrick61> GOD.wav
[1:29:58] <%superc37> Reminder that sam was totally gonna delete god in doom 2016
[1:30:05] <Make_me_mad> Can God run Crysis, though?
[1:30:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Maybe Sam would’ve backed him up if Doomguy hadn’t
[1:30:12] <Picosunloaded> delete god
[1:30:14] <venomfury86> Doom 2016 VEGA codex
[1:30:15] <Magicferret> Attack and dethrone god
[1:30:15] <MKII> our heavenly Vega who art in urdak
[1:30:16] <mark_collins45> god.exe
[1:30:17] <TheHardM> The wording is all mystical and stuff, but it's explained in that history of Urdak lore.
[1:30:18] <+Superbro64> "Because I'm FUCKING GOOD"
[1:30:22] <ulcaban> God the power bottom
[1:30:28] <%HitchhikingThrough> I mean it's always watching
[1:30:30] <ghostspartan80> God runs on 5G
[1:30:32] <%VidulaSaix> Well they explained it in the lore you already read. The Father was a conciousness that was instilled into the Maykr world itself
[1:30:33] <%Pillagius> cohhBot "Become AS GODS" cohhBot
[1:30:35] <Solidnick18> hell yeah

[1:30:48] <arkv01> is internet our new god?
[1:30:49] <BaldandBroken> is this game still worth playing? never downloaded it
[1:30:49] <%Asuterisuku> If GOD were the internet, humanity would be extinct.
[1:30:49] <%Shishi1205> remember the lore in 2016 that said that as an AI Vega was super op? Like the recreating of the math proffessor thingy and all of those things?
[1:30:49] <spidervenomized> god of porn
[1:30:50] <LeeOhX> all funko completerd
[1:30:51] <arkv01> yes

[1:30:53] <mark_collins45> Does god have a server farm somewhere?
[1:30:53] <Who_lio42> GOD sorts your porn for you

[1:31:11] <arkv01> god is in the machine, archiving your shitposts
[1:31:11] <TheHardM> God on my hard drive, running Oregon Trail.
[1:31:15] <Picosunloaded> @WoolieVersus remember that doom guy saved sam in 2016
[1:31:20] <pennykettle_> there was literally a field of science dedicated to studying the inner workings of god
[1:31:21] <%Irridium> horse porn in 100k

[1:31:24] <+ConLin_Arts_> Zone is god

[1:31:39] <%Javaa01> Now gotta go the other way
[1:31:45] <Solidnick18> other side
[1:31:50] <pennykettle_> the one that generates increasingly fucked up porn VHS? @Nested_Dreams
[1:31:55] <%Asuterisuku> This is the only non-linear objective in the game.
[1:31:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985

[1:33:51] <%HitchhikingThrough> fucked room huh?
[1:33:52] <%rosemon5001> soo question have we passed the pool area or nahh?
[1:33:54] <%Josef_Stryker> HUGE CUTS FOR HUGE GUTS
[1:34:00] <brachydios777> EZ
[1:34:01] <Nested_Dreams> It was SCP-1004
[1:34:07] <ghostspartan80> Tyrants are my favorite design in this game
[1:34:15] <venomfury86> nice headshot
[1:34:16] <pennykettle_> okay if there is a third entry in this modern doom series, I hope we return to Urdak as a total wasteland
[1:34:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie came out the fight with more health and armor than be did starting it. you love to see it
[1:34:20] <Who_lio42> no pools still comin up
[1:34:21] <%Asuterisuku> Seriously though, this level has pumped up Woolie's aim like crazy.
[1:34:25] <pixel_river> yes
[1:34:26] <Nested_Dreams> 1kb, infinity possibilities
[1:34:34] <Solidnick18> nope they just bring it down abit
[1:34:38] <%Javaa01> @ghostspartan80 Oh you mean the design from 1993 unchanged and adapted directly?
[1:34:38] <rytisone> get pumped for the next room
[1:34:39] <Solidnick18> for the calm parts
[1:34:43] <%doomerskeletor13> @pennykettle_ It seems that’s what the DLC will be doing
[1:34:45] <venomfury86> @ghostspartan80 mine are Dread Knights
[1:34:52] <brachydios777> @ghostspartan80 A design lasting from the 90s
[1:34:52] <dinnydanny777> The game is literally saying "get good"
[1:34:59] <derap41> Woolie not a fan of Ruined Orgasms
[1:35:00] <DelgotHansto> I love that the enemies you started out fighting become such fodder that the game doesn't even bother making you finish them off
[1:35:02] <pennykettle_> lewdskeletor13 arent both the dlcs prequels?
[1:35:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Well when a weapon point pops up that usually means it’s over
[1:35:07] <ghostspartan80> yeah, the design is so strong its literally the same
[1:35:08] <peachy996> game wants to keep you tense for more
[1:35:12] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh the puzzles in this room are fucking dumb
[1:35:13] <Augus7717> !uptime
[1:35:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 50 minutes
[1:35:23] <%rosemon5001> pole?
[1:35:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Doom guy can't smell anymore demons around
[1:35:28] <%doomerskeletor13> @pennykettle_ Nope. The first DLC description takes place explicitly after the campaign
[1:35:33] <%Javaa01> Just go up the elevator
[1:35:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus it's second floor from what I remember
[1:35:35] <%Asuterisuku> That is not reachable.
[1:35:39] <pennykettle_> @lewdskeletor13 oh wow damn, okay thanks
[1:35:40] <hattrick61> you'll loop around
[1:35:41] <megamonmon123> its progress
[1:35:54] <%alpacasintophats> you'll loop around to it
[1:36:06] <Solidnick18> he did it
[1:36:06] <TheHardM> Nah, it's a ghost, it's fine.
[1:36:09] <ghostspartan80> Boss time?
[1:36:12] <brachydios777> @pennykettle_ Cross your fingers for a mech segment
[1:36:14] <%Asuterisuku> The Wraiths aren't limited to where they died.
[1:36:15] <venomfury86> too many cookies
[1:36:18] <%doomerskeletor13> They’re just vibing
[1:36:18] <%VidulaSaix> About to? You already let Hell in LUL
[1:36:20] <%Javaa01> Well, I mean, it's already being invaded by demons, so it's already fucked
[1:36:23] <pennykettle_> I dont understand them being spirits, are they projecting themselves? I liked pulling components out of dead guys
[1:36:24] <hypecentricspecter> He knows his duty
[1:36:24] <%haisho> no such thing as too many oreos
[1:36:25] <spidervenomized> it their heaven
[1:36:30] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Time flies when watching good content. Thanks Woolz and crew! Also, if you’re looking on a good one-off in the meantime, I’d recommend “The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa” A River City Rumble style beat em up, with Shades of GTO.
[1:36:31] <Solidnick18> just need the cheat
[1:36:37] <%Asuterisuku> I hope there's more stuff to spend oreos on in the DLC.
[1:36:38] <RunningNGunning> "Sorry not sorry"
[1:36:41] <%HitchhikingThrough> The idea that these mother fuckers were so G they managed to slay their way through hell straight into heaven is wild
[1:36:44] <ghostspartan80> Soul Oreos
[1:36:55] <megamonmon123> on your left
[1:37:03] <megamonmon123> lets go chat
[1:37:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> earf
[1:37:12] <%doomerskeletor13> Considering you have an overflow of tokens by the end, I think the DLC will add more to spend it on
[1:37:13] <venomfury86> Cool
[1:37:16] <%Asuterisuku> Look at that low-res earth.
[1:37:22] <hattrick61> The Bifrost
[1:37:24] <%Asuterisuku> That legit looks much better on PC.
[1:37:28] <Solidnick18> thanks optimus
[1:37:29] <ghostspartan80> this kinda reminds me if halo 4 a bit
[1:37:30] <RunningNGunning> Time to go fuck up Thano- I mean the Icon of Sin
[1:37:32] <%SuperKirby24> almost time for "that" fight PogChamp
[1:37:36] <brachydios777> Big portal for big boys
[1:37:36] <TheHardM> The longer the Icon of Sin is on Earth, the stronger he becomes!
[1:37:40] <pennykettle_> I wonder if those ring colors represent anything
[1:37:42] <rytisone> earth looks more high res on pc
[1:37:44] <MKII> don't forget Vega. did we bring a zip drive
[1:37:48] <%Asuterisuku> IS it? HMMMM
[1:37:49] <%doomerskeletor13> The longer the Icon of Sin is on Earth, the stronger it becomes
[1:37:49] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Asuterisuku you aren't wrong, it looks much cleaner
[1:37:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE VS GOD (FINAL)
[1:37:51] <%VidulaSaix> Good eye

[1:39:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> He HATES it
[1:39:26] <+zetastriker> I do wonder how Sam got his own thing going though. There's that lore entry that says no Makyr can defy the Khan or something.
[1:39:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Pain Elementals are cruel
[1:39:29] <%Shishi1205> check the cool dude in the water
[1:39:34] <venomfury86> i like the all codex achievement name
[1:39:37] <%BisoromiBear> finally makes it to heaven just to clip into a wall for eternity
[1:39:40] <%Asuterisuku> Lost souls, demoted to Pain Elemental attacks for this game.
[1:39:47] <Tha_Mik> Good
[1:39:48] <pennykettle_> @zetastriker there are different levels of maykr I think. the drones cant resist, samur isnt a drone
[1:40:01] <%doomerskeletor13> That was my understanding too
[1:40:04] <peachy996> @pennykettle_ But the lore said all maykr
[1:40:05] <ghostspartan80> Pain Elementals are grandpas with constant back pain
[1:40:06] <TheHardM> 6/75 headshots
[1:40:14] <+zetastriker> Yeah, I think the lore didn't specify drones.
[1:40:16] <%doomerskeletor13> 6/75
[1:40:19] <gunsrlove> big lore time
[1:40:20] <%Asuterisuku> He's up to something like 30 now.
[1:40:22] <pennykettle_> PogChamp
[1:40:22] <+zetastriker> Maybe he just got it in before she said no
[1:40:27] <%HitchhikingThrough> Can't even hate on Woolie for those things, maker drones are a bitch to kill

[1:42:34] <%BinaryFireball> I would eat it
[1:42:36] <TheHardM> Ripe for both ripping and/or tearing.
[1:42:36] <brachydios777> Literally Bayonetta

[1:42:44] <%brunoberserk> THIS A AAAALIEEENNN
[1:42:47] <%Pillagius> Yea, it's probably one of the previous Khan Makyrs
[1:42:48] <alphalejandro> The Maykrs look a lot like the Mother Demon from Doom 64
[1:42:48] <pennykettle_> I love this room because they just show you and move on
[1:42:50] <Who_lio42> yeah Im assuming its what the NEXT kahn was supposed to be but with daddy gone its dead
[1:42:52] <+Ether101_Prime> I don't think that its armor. It seems to be an actual part of their body.
[1:42:53] <%alpacasintophats> pretty sure this a dead one
[1:42:54] <Nested_Dreams> Argent Fried Maykr
[1:42:54] <%haisho> it has no feet of course Reggie wouldn't
[1:43:01] <StarlitStunner> No feet, Reggie’s not interested
[1:43:02] <ghostspartan80> definitely gained some insight
[1:43:02] <dinnydanny777> Why is this preserved?
[1:43:04] <%Asuterisuku> The only water in the game that isn't toxic.
[1:43:08] <ralphfromdk> legacy0117 Yes and no. Sam stole the father so there could not be made any more Khans, so she has to keep using argent energy to stay alive as the last of her kind.
[1:43:16] <arkv01> its like dried squid
[1:43:18] <@Solidus_113> false gods

[1:43:32] <derap41> IF IT BLEEED WE CAN KILL IT!
[1:43:39] <DelgotHansto> The big reveal being that they wear clothes
[1:43:39] <brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 My guess this was a previous or supposed to have been the next Khan
[1:43:40] <%dekkitout> We got grape crush instead of orange tang
[1:43:41] <DedlokPM> @Ether101_Prime he was saying the "robot" look is the armor not what he was looking at just now
[1:43:42] <LeeOhX> its good to know that they're flesh...means you can kill em
[1:43:43] <%Javaa01> That's it
[1:43:45] <%Neoepochx> Fasttravel upcoming
[1:43:46] <rytisone> you saw what you needed

[1:43:56] <%Asuterisuku> You can go back and get that sword ammo.
[1:43:56] <@Solidus_113> get that sword ammo if you can
[1:43:58] <ghostspartan80> does it have HUGE GUTS?
[1:43:59] <arkv01> they have soft fleshy bits, they can be ripped and torn
[1:44:04] <Solidnick18> that is everything
[1:44:06] <%rosemon5001> go get the sword ammo
[1:44:10] <dinnydanny777> But we can kill God too
[1:44:10] <RogueMinja> Now go grab that sword.

[1:44:30] <%Ashenik1> ...
[1:44:31] <%Pillagius> Enemies die when you kill them, yea
[1:44:31] <Solidnick18> jeez
[1:44:31] <+zetastriker> Woolie saying "the implication" made me realize the Khan Makyr uses the Dennis system on new worlds.
[1:44:32] <%Javaa01> So then go kill it
[1:44:33] <%HitchhikingThrough> Japan has run that trope so far into the ground that the west is using it now

[1:47:29] <peachy996> Lock On Rocket is good
[1:47:29] <%SuperKirby24> LOCK ON ROCKET DOES BIG BOI DAMAGE
[1:47:30] <Nomad94> It's important to know that disabling her shield INSTANTLY recharges Blood Punch!
[1:47:30] <hypecentricspecter> how would doomguy get this info now that VEGA is out of his system?
[1:47:31] <ghostspartan80> remember the floor is lava!

[1:48:09] <%rosemon5001> crimson drones yooooo
[1:48:12] <megamonmon123> lock on is your best friend
[1:48:16] <+zetastriker> Ballista mods do less DPS than normal shots on her
[1:48:18] <+zetastriker> It's weird
[1:48:18] <VickytheCarWash> blood punch auto refills if you break her shield so dont worry about recharging blood punch
[1:48:21] <%Reveresao> ROCKETS
[1:48:21] <derap41> Kronica you bitch
[1:48:23] <%HitchhikingThrough> YO WAIT WHAT
[1:48:26] <%Josef_Stryker> RIP
[1:48:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Mortal Kombat Doom crossover
[1:48:29] <Nomad94> RIP
[1:48:30] <ralphfromdk> This is gonna be a loooong fight.
[1:48:30] <Make_me_mad> The tutorials for these boss fights are a bit much. It'd be worth it, though, if it just led to a boss fight against a Tyrant and the tutorial box appeared and told you to shoot it until it died.
[1:48:31] <pennykettle_> this is going to be a long fight
[1:48:33] <venomfury86> Pat said this boss fight was easier than the final
[1:48:36] <megamonmon123> yes
[1:48:36] <%Asuterisuku> No more extra lives, gotta do it raw.
[1:48:36] <%HitchhikingThrough> how much damage does that chain gun do holy shit?
[1:48:37] <@Solidus_113> HOOK
[1:48:37] <ghostspartan80> big ol dps race here
[1:48:40] <Xxstevo69xX > use them lock on rockets
[1:48:42] <%a_goth_pancake> I found rocket burdts to be the most effective
[1:48:43] <%LynbellDaYo> bye
[1:48:44] <peachy996> It is easy
[1:48:45] <pennykettle_> MEAT revealed
[1:48:45] <+jiggy_snipe> lol

[1:48:48] <arkv01> doomguy gonna be in MK soon?
[1:48:54] <Nested_Dreams> Now 5 more times
[1:48:54] <%LynbellDaYo> CALM DOWN
[1:48:55] <hypecentricspecter> oh boy
[1:48:56] <peachy996> But man is it satisfying to punch her
[1:49:02] <alphalejandro> She's like a late Kirby boss
[1:49:02] <%DesertPenguin> FLOOR IS LAVA
[1:49:02] <pennykettle_> doomguy for smash... cmon
[1:49:02] <%seduwu> this fight was mad easy but apparently people found it hard
[1:49:06] <megamonmon123> this boss is gonna be fun
[1:49:06] <gunsrlove> Oh no, accuracy needed
[1:49:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Fuck them angels
[1:49:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> ...you can use the ice grenades before you headshot them, I'm stupid
[1:49:10] <%haisho> man these drones still creep me out with how they sound
[1:49:18] <LeeOhX> Its tough the first cpuple of times
[1:49:19] <GarbageNirvana> It's hard if you only use certain weapons
[1:49:20] <%LynbellDaYo> normal shots seem stronger
[1:49:27] <megamonmon123> yeah rocket is good here
[1:49:28] <ghostspartan80> the floor turning into lava was the hard part
[1:49:29] <RogueMinja> The area of denial in this fight was really ahard for me, haha.
[1:49:31] <+Ether101_Prime> You can also quick scope them.
[1:49:32] <Mrthefro> It is easier
[1:49:35] <pennykettle_> It took me like 5 tries
[1:49:36] <dinnydanny777> No way is this the whole fight
[1:49:47] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus boss can and absolutely will heal
[1:49:51] <GarbageNirvana> The health regen is a pain in the ass regardless
[1:49:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Fire = bad
[1:49:52] <%BisoromiBear> fire bad
[1:49:54] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:49:58] <TheHardM> Shield go UP
[1:49:58] <LeeOhX> also the shield regens if you're not always on top of that
[1:49:58] <dinnydanny777> Ah it heals, got it
[1:50:01] <@Solidus_113> save that
[1:50:03] <ghostspartan80> use lock on rockets
[1:50:04] <megamonmon123> rockets good, fire bad
[1:50:04] <pennykettle_> UNMAYK HER
[1:50:08] <pixel_river> its the fire attacks that got me
[1:50:08] <rytisone> it just might
[1:50:12] <Picosunloaded> boi
[1:50:14] <peachy996> Do not use the BFG on her
[1:50:20] <%LynbellDaYo> health up on that rock

[1:50:43] <pixel_river> dayum
[1:50:43] <ghostspartan80> save the unmakyr on the last phases
[1:50:43] <%a_goth_pancake> you can hop between them safely.
[1:50:44] <Solidnick18> cronch
[1:50:44] <%Pillagius> Woolie, I think this "divine" gardening tool is real mad right now woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[1:50:45] <venomfury86> easy
[1:50:45] <Make_me_mad> Meathooking the drones and shotgunning their head at point blank range is my preferred strategy.
[1:50:46] <MasterTonberry23> Knocked off the platform too
[1:50:46] <%BisoromiBear> that was a warm up
[1:50:48] <%Javaa01> Learn to shoot, the boss fight
[1:50:48] <megamonmon123> rockets MELT her
[1:50:49] <LeeOhX> what got me all the time was not moving around wnough
[1:50:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> bodied
[1:50:57] <MKII> only way to heal. it's tough
[1:51:00] <ghostspartan80> avoid lava the boss
[1:51:04] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus that thing where you ice grenaded then quickscoped is great
[1:51:06] <%seduwu> rockets are really good against her
[1:51:07] <DedlokPM> REGA
[1:51:12] <%rosemon5001> lol they would make the drone headshots a tip for this fight
[1:51:12] <%VidulaSaix> Did Reggie just say he'd be Woolie's God

[1:54:12] <+zetastriker> I didn't try the lock on with her
[1:54:14] <%HitchhikingThrough> absolutely crushing it holy shit
[1:54:18] <RogueMinja> I shouldve used rockets on her.
[1:54:23] <%DesertPenguin> LUL
[1:54:26] <hattrick61> UNMAYK-HER
[1:54:27] <%doomerskeletor13> She’s looking a little rough
[1:54:28] <Raldavar> Woolie why are you forcing the angel lady to strip?

[1:54:35] <Nomad94> that's hot
[1:54:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...If you were close that would have destroyed her
[1:54:45] <%DesertPenguin> Did they add in that you can see her behind cover like that?
[1:54:48] <+Mkingston> You're fuckin' down with the sickness
[1:54:49] <@Solidus_113> HEADSHOTS
[1:54:50] <Solidnick18> haaha
[1:54:51] <Tha_Mik> damn
[1:54:51] <ghostspartan80> unmakyr kinda eh
[1:54:51] <%SuperKirby24> F
[1:54:53] <%rosemon5001> its good enough just the aim is the issue
[1:54:53] <CoffeeSlice> headshots
[1:54:55] <peachy996> ded
[1:54:55] <megamonmon123> you'll get it
[1:54:56] <MasterTonberry23> Its fine, that was a practice run
[1:54:57] <+Yamchadassist> Freeze bomb into headshot all day
[1:54:57] <+zetastriker> I just bursted her with repeated BFGs at the end like that
[1:54:57] <+dmtjinni> F
[1:55:02] <TheHardM> Maykers have tentacles.
[1:55:03] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus try ice grenades then headshots
[1:55:04] <%Atomik456> rip
[1:55:05] <youthgonewild77> F
[1:55:06] <brachydios777> NotLikeThis
[1:55:07] <%Javaa01> Throw that shotgun in the trash and get good
[1:55:10] <$Rumbutt> BFG is better than Unmakyr here
[1:55:12] <%Tugg_boat> Good try
[1:55:16] <%SuperKirby24> yeah, last 2 bars are when things get wild
[1:55:16] <mark_collins45> headshot for resources
[1:55:18] <Who_lio42> shotgun sticky bombs can be USED FOR HEADSHOT
[1:55:20] <ghostspartan80> ballista + rocket combo
[1:55:20] <SuperChumps> This fight looks so easy on baby mode.
[1:55:22] <DelgotHansto> UNMAKYR takes her down even quicker at close range
[1:55:26] <%seduwu> please headshot them it gives chainsaw resources
[1:55:33] <LeeOhX> woolie try using the sticky grenades for the other shotgun to get those headshots maybe?
[1:55:37] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Use the meat hook to grapple across the arena. It's known in the speed run community as a Yeet Hook
[1:55:48] <%LynbellDaYo> stop letting your damage go to waste
[1:55:48] <MasterTonberry23> Max made headshotting those drones look so easy :P
[1:56:00] <SuperChumps> Pulse Gun

[1:58:22] <+Mkingston> This fight took me many many attempts

[2:01:22] <dinnydanny777> I just notices but this music sounds like chiptune
[2:01:30] <+tearfuldevil> @SuperChumps there's a difficulty below normal so...
[2:01:42] <venomfury86> i don't think we will see the final level
[2:01:43] <SuperChumps> @tearfuldevil baby mode
[2:01:52] <%DesertPenguin> Depending on how this goes, Woolie may be exhausted or pumped up
[2:02:02] <%emperordread> the jukes
[2:02:03] <%DesertPenguin> Use a different gun for fuck's sake lol
[2:02:05] <ghostspartan80> yeah the next fights DO NOT let up
[2:02:05] <brachydios777> Headshot with chaingun seemed good
[2:02:07] <peachy996> Oh we'll get to the Final level I don't know if we'll get to the Icon of Sin
[2:02:13] <peachy996> Woolie's got this
[2:02:20] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[2:02:21] <dinnydanny777> Is the music kind of 8 bit or is it just me
[2:02:22] <+tearfuldevil> @SuperChumps yes yes, you're so impressive for playing fps' on higher difficulties, im awed by your hand eye cordination, your kdr is so big

[2:02:31] <DedlokPM> BUTT PUNCH rooH
[2:02:31] <rytisone> Tag: Fisting
[2:02:32] <Solidnick18> right in the booty
[2:02:33] <Make_me_mad> Icon of Sin is comparatively pretty easy.
[2:02:35] <%dekkitout> "Please don't break my butt!"
[2:02:36] <%HitchhikingThrough> Not enough
[2:02:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Hit it from the back
[2:02:43] <+Mkingston> Fisting God
[2:02:44] <Halospaz117> This guys comes by and slaps your god on the ass, what do you do?
[2:02:57] <%DesertPenguin> Chaingun Shield is best for you to get headshots safely
[2:03:08] <%Neoepochx> You can headshot frozen enemies it'll make using the scope easier for you.
[2:03:21] <ghostspartan80> beat her ass
[2:03:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEADSHOT FROZEN DRONES
[2:03:29] <+hod_fareview> In a game that discourages the halting of movement in battle, Woolie remains stagnant.
[2:03:29] <%HitchhikingThrough> ^^
[2:03:30] <dinnydanny777> It seems like if you use the shield these enemies can't really hit you
[2:03:31] <%DesertPenguin> That too. Freeze them so they don't move
[2:03:31] <%seduwu> the pop sound effects on the headshot is great
[2:03:33] <@Solidus_113> spicy floors
[2:03:45] <+Ether101_Prime> It seems that quick scoping the drones will have the icon on their head for a second.
[2:03:46] <venomfury86> Woolie loves the super shotgun too much
[2:03:50] <CoffeeSlice> PogChamp
[2:03:53] <%Neoepochx> Using the shotgun is really random for headshots

[2:06:42] <%DesertPenguin> You only get it on the last level, fucking pointless
[2:06:42] <%Neoepochx> @BallerSwagBro9k I thought it was the Dark Lord. I imagine without Maykrs they will have a harder time just going to dimensions/worlds to consume
[2:06:46] <%HitchhikingThrough> I know right?
[2:06:47] <CoffeeSlice> o boi
[2:06:53] <%doomerskeletor13> People think it might be The Dark Lord since there’s a VA listed for the Dark Lord in the credits but he never shows up
[2:06:55] <venomfury86> YEYEYEYE
[2:06:58] <ghostspartan80> two blood punches changes the game
[2:06:58] <%Shishi1205> I think its Father
[2:06:59] <%alpacasintophats> well that might be a reason to go

[2:07:12] <%LynbellDaYo> why would it be the dark lord after they sent an invasion to urdak
[2:07:13] <venomfury86> stream end Kappa
[2:07:17] <%GraceTBM> @DesertPenguin even if you discount replaying the game, there's master levels
[2:07:19] <%DesertPenguin> Vega is Father?
[2:07:20] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus its a great boss. Sure glad that was the final boss and that there aren't any more after that
[2:07:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @lewdskeletor13 Dataminers confirmed it with the audio filr
[2:07:23] <gunsrlove> It's probably the Dark Lord, mentioned in several lore pieces, she DID have a deal with Hell
[2:07:23] <%LynbellDaYo> i mean it could be, but seems off

[2:40:56] <%NotSafeForPBS> He came to Argent from where hellfire reigned Rippin and Tearin are his middle name He couldn’t be stopped, though the hell priests tried cain’t no-a kahn mayker make em’ walk the line (chorus) When you see him comin’ you best step aside A lotta men didn’t; a lotta men died one first of iron, the other of steel if the right one don’t a-get you then the left one will (chorus)
[2:41:06] <pennykettle_> the REG system should require one of the 3 upgrade slots
[2:41:08] <dinnydanny777> RIP and tear until it is done
[2:41:12] <venomfury86> flame belch plus frags
[2:41:17] <%SuperKirby24> just a little more till the funhouse LUL
[2:41:20] <%chiluzza> oh man i remember this tower even whe you think its over its not
[2:41:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Second_Omega to be clear by what I mean, I think that without the Ballista/SS technique, he doesn't have enough gimmicks to justify that healthbar. With it though it's well balanced and fun
[2:41:36] <RichochetForce> @chiluzza Yup, this is THE room.
[2:41:39] <ghostspartan80> this is just PART 1 of the tower
[2:41:39] <MasterTonberry23> Reggie you gotta maintain the commentary. Woolie has to focus
[2:41:45] <%seduwu> i hated this room so much
[2:41:53] <RichochetForce> @HitchhikingThrough He gets punked by remote rockets and grenades as well
[2:41:54] <+zetastriker> Haha, for real. He can't afford to get LP brain in this fight.
[2:41:54] <@Solidus_113> Bwoop woop woop woooooop
[2:41:56] <%HitchhikingThrough> WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP
[2:41:57] <dinnydanny777> This enemy basically just has a Megaman buster
[2:41:58] <TheAmazingClaytor> GUNSHOT BRIDE
[2:42:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> very nce
[2:42:08] <%Neoepochx> Ammo dude
[2:42:10] <venomfury86> woop woop woop
[2:42:11] <%LynbellDaYo> did he get staggered from a dash
[2:42:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:42:13] <megamonmon123> Good job woolie
[2:42:13] <Tha_Mik> wowee
[2:42:16] <pennykettle_> this room is exhausting
[2:42:17] <+zetastriker> Nice
[2:42:17] <RichochetForce> Awesome, Woolz.
[2:42:23] <TheAmazingClaytor> I saw that airshot Woolz, good shit good shit
[2:42:24] <+krispen_wa> Reggie is a good support caller
[2:42:30] <ghostspartan80> Great Job!
[2:42:30] <%seduwu> woolie is not ready for the next part
[2:42:37] <RichochetForce> @seduwu =)
[2:42:39] <Second_Omega> @HitchhikingThrough That does make sense, but that loop isn't the only method of dealing damage, stil the health bar is VERY Long with standard strats
[2:42:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> can we take a moment to appreciate woolie didn't accidentally blow himself up with that rocket
[2:42:51] <%BisoromiBear> BONK
[2:42:57] <DelgotHansto> I need a comparison of Woolie legitemately nearly dying to the three zombies in the first room to now
[2:43:07] <Second_Omega> He has finally learned to avoid splash damage
[2:43:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie is at the end of his character arc
[2:43:19] <%DesertPenguin> burn and explode
[2:43:20] <@Solidus_113> SAVOR
[2:43:27] <ghostspartan80> splash damage in this game wasn't as harsh compared to 2016 imo
[2:43:43] <rytisone> wall
[2:43:47] <%Javaa01> That 1 up is later, for now, keep going up and fight anything that comes in your way
[2:43:59] <%Neoepochx> Look for green
[2:44:06] <+zetastriker> I don't know @ghostspartan80 it seems like more than the small amount you took after getting the upgrades that reduce self-damage in 2016
[2:44:09] <pennykettle_> SourPls
[2:44:09] <@Solidus_113> OH YOU THOUGHT?
[2:44:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie with theeyeballs
[2:44:11] <RichochetForce> lol
[2:44:12] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Second_Omega yeah, I guess the weird thing is that unlike every other enemy, normal strats make the fight kinda tedious. Don't get that feeling from the doom hunter for whatever reason. Not necessarily a bad thing, but mentioning the alternate strats in a menu somewhere would have been nice
[2:44:12] <hattrick61> NOT YET
[2:44:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> green I'd go
[2:44:12] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:44:12] <rytisone> but wait, there's more
[2:44:12] <Tha_Mik> Music starts
[2:44:13] <+einherjarvalk> IT'S NOT OVER YET
[2:44:14] <Second_Omega> DID YOU THINK
[2:44:15] <TheAmazingClaytor> FUCK ROOM PT 2
[2:44:16] <RichochetForce> Reggie: "WHAT!?"

[2:45:08] <+zetastriker> I got screwed here because I had almost no ammo after the previous fight, and it's a bit before grunt enemies show up here
[2:45:08] <%andrex2311> just made it! what did I miss?

[2:46:05] <megamonmon123> cracked wall
[2:46:06] <Second_Omega> @HitchhikingThrough I feel out of the tutorial it gives being the very simple "Its vulnerable when green/directly after attacking" Leaves room for creativity, its just unfortunate that The Loop is just very, Very effective.
[2:46:08] <+hod_fareview> There was a breakable
[2:46:09] <megamonmon123> go back
[2:46:11] <hassanico2> Barons being weird flame men feels odd

[2:47:40] <ghostspartan80> Cultist base has two tyrants at the start
[2:47:54] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Second_Omega I think the plasma rifle working on the shield would have been good. Not as effective as actually waiting for its guard to drop, but it would at the very least mean you didn't have to worry about accidentally shooting the shield when room clearing other enemies
[2:47:56] <blaggablag> It's a nice dance of mayhem

[2:49:11] <Second_Omega> @HitchhikingThrough Encouraging alternative Options that while not as effective are still methods to either expose a week point or keep a distance would of course be best, BUt as it is I think its fine.

[2:50:16] <%Javaa01> Yes, if you see one in an arena, that means the devs expect you to also use one
[2:50:19] <DelgotHansto> @hassanico2 either his left where he stops your punch kinda like the fury buster from dmc 5, or his axe holster where you give him an execution and toss his axe
[2:50:19] <venomfury86> Welcome to the Master Level

[2:55:32] <+Mkingston> Abby tho
[2:55:32] <@Solidus_113> this section reminds me of Crysis 3

[2:57:01] <venomfury86> Horatio: "The longer the Icon of Sin is on earth... the stronger will it become"

[3:19:05] <%Shishi1205> left side and right arm
[3:19:05] <%Neoepochx> And a shoulder
[3:19:07] <%SuperKirby24> PK HELLFIRE
[3:19:08] <somekindaspy> @HitchhikingThrough had three
[3:19:09] <%Shishi1205> or hand
[3:19:14] <venomfury86> Three
[3:19:16] <somekindaspy> This game has five
[3:19:17] <alphalejandro> Icon of Sin cast Meteor
[3:19:19] <%HitchhikingThrough> @somekindaspy what was # 1?
[3:19:26] <somekindaspy> @HitchhikingThrough the cyberdemon
[3:19:26] <%Neoepochx> Blood punch refills
[3:19:26] <%dekkitout> Oof- he's all gristle
[3:19:26] <+Mkingston> sword
[3:19:31] <RogueMinja> Sword.
[3:19:33] <%HitchhikingThrough> @somekindaspy then what was # 2?
[3:19:34] <pennykettle_> I liked how long it took to get to the first boss in 2016
[3:19:36] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus you have a sword!
[3:19:37] <%Shishi1205> Swor them
[3:19:39] <+zetastriker> Two of this game's bosses are glorified super heavies, it really has three bosses
[3:19:40] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:19:40] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:19:41] <RichochetForce> Wow

[3:19:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU'LL COWARDS DON'T EVEN SMOKE ARGENT
[3:19:55] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh come on that wasn't a boss fight
[3:19:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> I mean
[3:20:00] <+zetastriker> I think Gladiator is the best boss, but the other 2016 bosses beat Khan Makyr and this
[3:20:01] <%HitchhikingThrough> not that this is a boss fight either
[3:20:02] <DelgotHansto> The Icon of Sin used: Limit Break: Meteor Rain
[3:20:05] <+paladinstarbuster> SHOOT HIS DICK
[3:20:05] <%Neoepochx> That should might need another hit
[3:20:13] <%dekkitout> 4/8, 16/75
[3:20:16] <DeeVee_TV> bonk

[3:20:20] <mark_collins45> Manos!
[3:20:21] <RichochetForce> @zetastriker Yeah, this is a crappy way of ending the stage and game

[3:21:05] <%RadicalWeegee> This Friend is spitten!
[3:21:06] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieSMUG
[3:21:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ooooh that's a new one PogChamp
[3:21:09] <RichochetForce> @Nomad94 Compared to the rest of this stage? It's crap. Large, meatwall enemies are low tier. Permanently.
[3:21:10] <SheefEatsBeef> I SPIT THAT
[3:21:12] <+tearfuldevil> and woolies having fun, so eh
[3:21:15] <somekindaspy> aim for his arms
[3:21:15] <%Neoepochx> Right shoulder and left arm

[3:21:33] <%Josef_Stryker> Shoulder?
[3:21:35] <somekindaspy> aim for his hand
[3:21:36] <pennykettle_> If only we could have just fought the Icon of Sin as a relatively normal sized enemy by piloting an equal sized mecha
[3:21:44] <GarbageNirvana> Eat dat BBQ
[3:21:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> body shots
[3:21:45] <%jepupu> Left shoulder
[3:21:46] <%Gruhunchously> Is that the ICON OF SIN?
[3:21:48] <DelgotHansto> Hidden 3rd phase of the icon is just a screaming wall with a head
[3:21:49] <hattrick61> BOSS TIP: shoot it till it dies
[3:21:51] <Second_Omega> Body body body upper
[3:21:52] <%Shishi1205> SWORD
[3:21:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> TWIST HIS DICK
[3:21:54] <extradopeness> Sweet dolla tea from McDonald's
[3:22:10] <DelgotHansto> For how long Woolie took in Urdak the icon of sin doesn't seem that powerful at all
[3:22:14] <RichochetForce> @Nomad94 We'll just have to agree to disagree. But Icon of Sin as a Marauder sized enemy > this. I know this is an homage to the Icon of Sin wall fight in the original Doom, but come on.
[3:22:14] <EsotericOdyssey> woolie please use the crucible sword
[3:22:15] <+krabsan> Look at all this swordammo

[3:27:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ITS A WHAT NOW ENDING
[3:27:08] <%Neoepochx> Still some lingering questions.
[3:27:08] <RunningNGunning> There are about 10 mins of credits just so you know
[3:27:09] <peachy996> It'll be a long credits though
[3:27:10] <%invader_rin> DLC
[3:27:10] <%SuperKirby24> LOOKAT ALL THOSE DEVS YEY
[3:27:11] <+Mkingston> Great tattoo on the left
[3:27:11] <+green715> They posted DLC screenshots. You're going back to fallen Urdak
[3:27:12] <DelgotHansto> The deal is that he went back at the end of 2016 and they WERE ALREADY INVADING
[3:27:12] <somekindaspy> Story DLC will continue the story!
[3:27:14] <pennykettle_> no mecha fight tho
[3:27:14] <DatAsuna> It's kind of anti climatic yeah
[3:27:15] <hattrick61> Good on sam for not stealing the fortress like i thought he would
[3:27:20] <arkv01> really wow uh
[3:27:23] <DeathByPoke7> questions like Robots?
[3:27:25] <QaizerArt> Last reminder, Don't Skip The Credits.
[3:27:27] <DatAsuna> Eh
[3:27:29] <+arancet> i wanted a mech, and...
[3:27:30] <Visorak6> NO MECH BATTLE
[3:27:30] <dinnydanny777> Exceeded your expectations
[3:27:31] <%rosemon5001> you didnt get the mech
[3:27:33] <pixel_river> LUL
[3:27:34] <DatAsuna> He's more like the reamrunner than vergil
[3:27:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> You wanted a mech... you were denied
[3:27:38] <%Neoepochx> But hook?
[3:27:38] <rytisone> I wanted to pilot that mecha in the base
[3:27:39] <venomfury86> @anita_dickin Same

[3:27:46] <%Theycallmenerf> Twist his dick
[3:27:48] <alphalejandro> NO MECH THOU
[3:27:49] <pennykettle_> that finale should have been a mecha battle
[3:27:50] <%Gruhunchously> TRICKSTER
[3:27:50] <ghostspartan80> this is an improvement on every level
[3:27:51] <+Mkingston> I want that image on the left as a tattoo.
[3:27:53] <DatAsuna> Partly cause marauder is a generic enemy
[3:27:54] <%doomerskeletor13> Maybe mech in the DLC :(
[3:27:57] <%Neoepochx> Trickster + Gunslinger
[3:27:57] <somekindaspy> Story will continue with the DLC. It will be a full-on story with new demons.

[3:28:18] <CoffeeSlice> DLC HYPE
[3:28:21] <+Mkingston> The Doom Wars DLC
[3:28:22] <Tha_Mik> 10/10 not enough mechs
[3:28:23] <lotharrio> Mechedge?
[3:28:24] <Artoo_The_Me> Mech maybe??
[3:28:25] <MasterTonberry23> Would you say it subverted your expectations Kappa
[3:28:25] <pennykettle_> there will be no dlc mech, youre kidding yourselves
[3:28:25] <ghostspartan80> a tease gets you quaking for the dlcs
[3:28:25] <dinnydanny777> We didn't get to pilot an Evangelion to fight Satan
[3:28:26] <+ar4ndomblackguy> yeah that image on the left i need on a tshirt
[3:28:27] <somekindaspy> DLC story continues with going back to Urdak!

[3:28:34] <Nested_Dreams> MercyWing1 woolieYE MercyWing2
[3:28:34] <QaizerArt> Who needs a mech when you can kill godzilla size things on your own?
[3:28:46] <%Shishi1205> censored shirts btw
[3:28:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah the DLC description shows a messed up Urdak
[3:28:55] <+Bricespresso> i felt that too i thought the mech wasgonna be in the finale
[3:28:58] <%HitchhikingThrough> SENIOR HR MANAGER: JESSICA HARRIS
[3:29:02] <mdkcde> -5 points it is only a 12/10
[3:29:03] <%Neoepochx> Revelations would be a terrible subtitle
[3:29:07] <mdkcde> dissapointing
[3:29:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> It's deadass Jessica from HR
[3:29:09] <%Neoepochx> Dat Caco hat.
[3:29:09] <somekindaspy> We going back to URDAK in DLC. Full story with new demons and powers!
[3:29:10] <pennykettle_> and how god was almost deleted so you could take a one time portal to hell in 2016

[3:29:11] <%Theycallmenerf> Doom: Genesis
[3:29:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Doom: Damnation
[3:29:17] <%Gruhunchously> What's that writer's name again?
[3:29:19] <RunningNGunning> I gotta say woolz, your improvement from the beginning of this LP to now has been HUGE and you going off and improving on your own time is GREATLY appreciated
[3:29:21] <pennykettle_> Karen Tuk?
[3:29:25] <%a_goth_pancake> a_goth_pancake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Woolz, congrats on killing heaven and and an innocent little boy. Just wanted to say thanks for all the years of joy you've brought me, and I'm glad I can offer a sub as thanks. Stay healthy, catch you in the DLC.
[3:29:29] <RichochetForce> Yeah, first two DLC things are Return to Urdak and an ARC oil rig.
[3:29:33] <+ninjabush> i want to know WHERE THE HELL DID GET THAT RIDE
[3:29:34] <peachy996> Wait EG Daily?
[3:29:36] <CoffeeSlice> Kar En Tuk the children
[3:29:38] <brachydios777> There is cut dialogue you can look up
[3:29:41] <CoffeeSlice> :(
[3:29:41] <+Mkingston> @Gruhunchously William Shakespeare
[3:29:42] <%Neoepochx> "I'll get you next time slayer!"
[3:29:48] <pennykettle_> mick isnt coming back lol
[3:29:53] <peachy996> Why does the name EG Daily sound familiar
[3:29:53] <+RyTYoung> Gonna miss him
[3:29:53] <CoffeeSlice> Chad!!!
[3:29:59] <somekindaspy> @pennykettle_ that was half his own fault though. :/
[3:30:01] <%Shishi1205> big misses
[3:30:04] <hypecentricspecter> Pour one out for Mick
[3:30:06] <%Neoepochx> @DelgotHansto I do it to upset you.
[3:30:07] <+zetastriker> The whole promising the OST before it was ready sucked, but it's his fault they didn't fix it
[3:30:09] <kronostorm34> Hulshult Pog
[3:30:11] <+therabbles> mick has left after the final battle
[3:30:11] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus now watch that video Mick put out on the metal choir
[3:30:15] <TheHardM> Oh, biggest lore.
[3:30:16] <+zetastriker> Id was okay with him coming back after the fact and adding to the OST
[3:30:19] <pennykettle_> @somekindaspy yep unfortunately
[3:30:20] <%LynbellDaYo> They handled the ending really weird but incredibly good game otherwise
[3:30:22] <RichochetForce> Huge Lore
[3:30:23] <+jiggy_snipe> @peachy996 singer and voice of Tommy Pickles among other characters
[3:30:23] <%DesertPenguin> That Metal Choir video is cool
[3:30:25] <Tha_Mik> Big Lore
[3:30:26] <%a_goth_pancake> MICHAEL
[3:30:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Heavy ass lore
[3:30:30] <f0rgeman> when the shadows first lengthend\
[3:30:30] <ralphfromdk> Lore came aaaaall over the place :D
[3:30:33] <ghostspartan80> soft ending ngl
[3:30:35] <somekindaspy> Lore was HOT
[3:30:38] <f0rgeman> one stood
[3:30:42] <somekindaspy> @ghostspartan80 story dlc keeps it going.
[3:30:43] <peachy996> @jiggy_snipe I think I remember her from Devil's Rejects
[3:30:44] <f0rgeman> he chose the path
[3:30:47] <f0rgeman> of perpetual torment
[3:30:49] <negrosnake9185> Don’t forget about the upcoming two expansion packs
[3:30:49] <%VidulaSaix> That's a funny meme but honestly it would've worn thin very quickly
[3:30:49] <%a_goth_pancake> you killed the biggest demon who ever demon'd
[3:30:50] <pixel_river> nah lore though
[3:30:52] <%Gruhunchously> Cooling fans
[3:30:56] <pennykettle_> am I the father tho
[3:31:02] <venomfury86> I don't care what they say, i love this lore!
[3:31:04] <Nomad94> I didn't read any lore
[3:31:05] <somekindaspy> VEGA good boy was God.
[3:31:10] <%DesertPenguin> But also, people wanted a backstory for the guy with no backstory
[3:31:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Doomguy likes comics
[3:31:20] <%DesertPenguin> Sam is just a retcon, right?
[3:31:26] <f0rgeman> samur hayden
[3:31:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:31:29] <Shwepie> Lore is fine, Lore is great, just don't put it between Rip and Tear.
[3:31:30] <+jiggy_snipe> @peachy996 yea she also did alot of live action stuff too
[3:31:30] <%Asuterisuku> Samurl Hayden.
[3:31:32] <%a_goth_pancake> can we get a rip and tear emote?
[3:31:35] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s an angel named Samael
[3:31:35] <mark_collins45> Sam is the fallen angel.
[3:31:38] <derap41> D E E P L O R E
[3:31:43] <%VidulaSaix> Samael as well
[3:31:45] <ghostspartan80> HUGE GUTS is canon so I'm cool with all the lore
[3:31:45] <%Gruhunchously> Mick
[3:31:49] <%DesertPenguin> Exactly
[3:31:49] <gunsrlove> What's with these crazy stretch reaches LUL
[3:31:50] <%DesertPenguin> Retcon
[3:31:51] <+APegForReggie> Is doom guy circumcised?
[3:31:51] <Picosunloaded> fallen angel sam boi
[3:31:51] <venomfury86> VEGA IS GOD
[3:31:52] <%VidulaSaix> Just a guy LUL
[3:31:54] <dinnydanny777> Some guy
[3:31:55] <pennykettle_> Some random guy that got mercd
[3:31:56] <%LynbellDaYo> one guy
[3:31:56] <%Neoepochx> Samur...Samuel...? HMM
[3:31:56] <lotharrio> The "King Maykr?"
[3:31:57] <%DesertPenguin> It's a retcon?
[3:31:57] <Nomad94> some guy
[3:31:59] <+jiggy_snipe> some dude probably
[3:32:02] <dinnydanny777> His cosplayer
[3:32:03] <pennykettle_> false flag
[3:32:03] <TheHardM> Sam's definitely a squid monster.
[3:32:04] <%BisoromiBear> Luthor
[3:32:04] <peachy996> "Hey random human, say cheese!"
[3:32:05] <Solidnick18> a guy idk
[3:32:05] <+paladinstarbuster> Sam was a dude
[3:32:06] <LeeOhX> Maybe its just a fake painting he made
[3:32:07] <RichochetForce> False flag
[3:32:07] <lotharrio> Just some guy he killed.
[3:32:09] <DeeVee_TV> Some nerd that died, then Samur took his place as a robit?
[3:32:11] <%doomerskeletor13> I think he took over Sam Hayden’s life
[3:32:11] <mikesapartment> his fleshsom
[3:32:11] <%rosemon5001> @WoolieVersus its his human skin dlc
[3:32:12] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @DelgotHansto
[3:32:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Did Sam kill that guy and take his cover?
[3:32:15] <pennykettle_> I think the lore is fucked, super retconned I feel
[3:32:16] <brachydios777> That’s some bullshit
[3:32:18] <+jiggy_snipe> he's like G0T0 Kappa
[3:32:20] <TheHardM> He found a picture on shutterstock and bought it.
[3:32:21] <%HitchhikingThrough> or maybe this game got retconned to shit
[3:32:24] <RichochetForce> It would very easy for a makyr to lie about it
[3:32:24] <%DesertPenguin> he had cancer
[3:32:24] <dinnydanny777> He paid some guy to pretend to be him
[3:32:26] <+TheBigTaco> Wait, did they not pick up on vega being the father?
[3:32:31] <ghostspartan80> sounds like a skull face was in mgs 3 all along kind of retcon
[3:32:35] <somekindaspy> Pretty sure he technologically implanted his consciousness into the guy's head. The guy very suddenly got 4th stage cancer during the construction of the Argent Tower.
[3:32:35] <%LynbellDaYo> They did
[3:32:35] <peachy996> they did
[3:32:36] <dinnydanny777> He wore a skinsuit
[3:32:39] <+paladinstarbuster> they did
[3:32:40] <+Truebluemc> I feel like UAC just made up some shit
[3:32:46] <%doomerskeletor13> Remember the last game said he quickly got brain cancer, I think Samur replaces him then
[3:32:48] <gunsrlove> The guy in the photo is just some guy, nothing was retconned
[3:32:51] <TheHardM> God is the best Windows Assistant.
[3:32:51] <%a_goth_pancake> meat puppet
[3:32:52] <+TheBigTaco> Ah ok
[3:32:52] <derap41> Made god into a battery
[3:32:54] <mark_collins45> or he took a human form couldn't contain his Maykrness
[3:32:54] <dinnydanny777> He stapled the person over himselg
[3:32:58] <Solidnick18> in dlc
[3:32:58] <%Gruhunchously> Vega is God?
[3:33:00] <%Shishi1205> DLC
[3:33:01] <somekindaspy> Story DLC continues the story!
[3:33:01] <RichochetForce> DLC is coming
[3:33:02] <pennykettle_> I really do like the idea that Sam was just a guy with a company trying to save earth and found doomguy when researching hell. but now hell isnt biblical its just aliens
[3:33:05] <Visorak6> DLC
[3:33:05] <TheHardM> Vega is God is Bonzi Buddy
[3:33:06] <KillMyPast> STORY DLC
[3:33:06] <%Asuterisuku> Your fight is Eternal.
[3:33:08] <%VidulaSaix> DLC Tease Jebaited
[3:33:11] <ralphfromdk> It's not to far to think that these aliens that can rebirth them selves and made the slayer immortal could make a human body and put their mind into it. Sam made a human body, fucked of to earth with Vega (father) and then made the robot body later.
[3:33:12] <rytisone> he plays doom and doom 2 in his base in the meanwhile
[3:33:12] <RunningNGunning> We'll find out (hopefully) in DLC
[3:33:12] <%DesertPenguin> Hugo Martin puts mechs in everything he works on. It's his thing
[3:33:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Retires, lives on a beach, gets another rabbit Kappa
[3:33:21] <RichochetForce> DLC has new weapons, new areas, and apparently new weapons and suit upgrades
[3:33:25] <+OldDarkwraith> There's suppose to be DLC + post credit scene
[3:33:25] <+zetastriker> I think he went straight from Maykr to robot, and faked the human part.
[3:33:26] <%Neoepochx> Arc Complex is godlike
[3:33:26] <derap41> Lot of Ruinied orgasms
[3:33:30] <Tha_Mik> Daisy is irreplacable
[3:33:32] <%DesertPenguin> When is DLC
[3:33:34] <peachy996> Gonna miss Mick
[3:33:34] <%Gruhunchously> Extreme teasing
[3:33:34] <venomfury86> @woolieversus the scientist said Samuel's robot body is "ALL ALIEN"
[3:33:34] <%jinking79> the fact UAC couldn't fix him cause it Alien tech
[3:33:39] <%VidulaSaix> JUST LOG IN YOU OLD MAN LUL
[3:33:41] <Ozmodyas> The Artbook seems to imply we’re going into the Slayerverse
[3:33:45] <Tha_Mik> LUL
[3:33:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:33:50] <pennykettle_> Put a horde mode in

[3:33:52] <Second_Omega> BOut right
[3:33:53] <RichochetForce> @Ozmodyas ???
[3:33:53] <%Neoepochx> End of arena rankings
[3:33:53] <Nomad94> God please no
[3:33:55] <kronostorm34> Eternal Slayer Pog
[3:33:55] <+zetastriker> I just wonder if his original body is still somewhere
[3:33:55] <dinnydanny777> Satanic
[3:33:56] <+OldDarkwraith> Yeaaahhhh
[3:33:56] <%Shishi1205> SSSLAYER
[3:33:58] <%Javaa01> Arcade mode needs to come back
[3:33:59] <+krispen_wa> SMOKIN SEXY STYLE
[3:34:00] <dinnydanny777> Demonic
[3:34:01] <+einherjarvalk> SMOKING SLAYER STYLE
[3:34:02] <+ConLin_Arts_> Mick being a lazy lad
[3:34:03] <+ar4ndomblackguy> all would of been C
[3:34:03] <f0rgeman> quake con mode is style meter
[3:34:05] <%Neoepochx> Arcade mode would be good
[3:34:05] <%doomerskeletor13> Style on the demons

[3:37:22] <%Neoepochx> NERDS
[3:37:22] <%Irridium> you saved the rock floating in space
[3:37:22] <lotharrio> Pretty standard for Doom for Earth to get fucked.
[3:37:23] <RichochetForce> Yeah, 95% of people are dead. The planet is half-terraformed and poisonous to humans, the moon is fucked, and cultists might retry

[3:56:04] <%Lion_kun> YOU WELCOME CHAT
[3:56:07] <%ChoculaUltra> Can't believe From Software released Bloodborne as a Tiger Electronics handheld game
[3:56:07] <%VidulaSaix> And yo thanks @notsafeforpbs
[3:56:08] <Halospaz117> IT IS DONE
[3:56:09] <%Pillagius> Wools have you got to acquaint yourself with Metro 2033+ series?
[3:56:13] <+tearfuldevil> WOOLEI KILLED THAT KID
[3:56:22] <brachydios777> LUL
[3:56:25] <%LynbellDaYo> I missed it, what did they decide for thursday
[3:56:26] <venomfury86> @shishi1205 thanks
[3:56:28] <%doomerskeletor13> I would’ve been surprised if you guys didn’t finish this today
[3:56:29] <RichochetForce> Wow
[3:56:38] <Picosunloaded> fallen ange
[3:56:43] <RichochetForce> Vega = God
[3:56:46] <RichochetForce> Sam = Fallen Angel
[3:56:50] <RichochetForce> Doom guy = ???
[3:57:00] <%BisoromiBear> Doomguy = David
[3:57:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Samael in the Bible is a fallen angel
[3:57:04] <rytisone> a force of nature
[3:57:12] <+Takuatt> Sam=Satan=Lucifer+fallen Angel
[3:57:14] <%Javaa01> Doomslayer got the good blessing
[3:57:21] <+GingerStrawhat> No more Devil Games for Woolie sadly
[3:57:22] <%VidulaSaix> You dont know that Woolie LUL
[3:57:24] <brachydios777> Slayer was powerd by an Angel technicaliy
[3:57:30] <%NotSafeForPBS> @VidulaSaix No problem I'm just depressed...had some fun with the '16 tons' bit and was desperate to get it noticed
[3:57:37] <RichochetForce> Will Doomguy start a human version of the Night Sentinels?
[3:57:37] <%doomerskeletor13> He’s closer to a demigod
[3:57:40] <%Klefth> Trinity?
[3:57:45] <%Irridium> Doomslayer is Jacob
[3:57:48] <%VidulaSaix> @notsafeforpbs Aww dont do that man. Put yourself first
[3:57:51] <%ChoculaUltra> STYLE TRIGGER
[3:57:53] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 Yeah, Khan Maykr calls him a demigod
[3:57:53] <%Shishi1205> DMC5 Quadruple S
[3:57:55] <DelgotHansto> Quadruple S
[3:57:56] <Who_lio42> them blessings that fuckin jacob was wrasslin angels for
[3:58:11] <derap41> They could have done it so you unlocked outfits for it but that would be too cool
[3:58:13] <brachydios777> That’s True
[3:58:20] <DelgotHansto> Other than that Higher Style means Higher DT gain
[3:58:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh shit
[3:58:26] <pixel_river> arcade mode should be in eternal
[3:58:26] <shin_marx> free bloodpunch, or free bfg
[3:58:30] <%RioGascar> for dante only, what about nero or V
[3:58:43] <rytisone> dt on, dt off, dt on, dt off
[3:58:43] <%Shishi1205> V with that would be omega busted
[3:58:44] <%LordDukeFishington> so crucible sword could be free for a few swings if Doom eternal added style meter
[3:58:48] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Hey yo, it's Eden here. Someone told me you were on the list, I guess they counted RoosterTeeth?
[3:58:53] <brachydios777> Having that in more games would be cool
[3:58:55] <%Shishi1205> Getting SSS for V is super easy
[3:58:58] <%NotSafeForPBS> @VidulaSaix thanks
[3:59:04] <RichochetForce> There's a hanging story point from the first game involving the Demonic Crucible.
[3:59:04] <+paladinstarbuster> All the powerups should be a meter you build up for certain actions
[3:59:08] <%Atomik456> i mean high style gives you currency doesn't it?
[3:59:08] <DelgotHansto> Again, keeping triple s gives you so much dt
[3:59:16] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus would your style meter go down if damaged? for Doom it sounds impossible to not take damage.
[3:59:24] <RichochetForce> Apparently the Demonic Crucible is going to be used by an ultimate corrupter that destroys all realms.
[3:59:27] <venomfury86> Arcade mode is the reason why i'm coming back to Doom 2016 from time to time
[3:59:34] <%DesertPenguin> It should go down if you lose a full block
[3:59:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:59:35] <DatAsuna> I did
[3:59:46] <Second_Omega> Rich Get Richer For High Style ranks
[3:59:54] <RichochetForce> Experimentation and flexibility is not fake replay value.
[3:59:55] <@Solidus_113> you want to S rank all the missions
[3:59:57] <%doomerskeletor13> @richochetforce Where’d you hear that
[3:59:58] <DatAsuna> Don't need a style meter, but it helps motivate you if you're lazy
[4:00:03] <+Takuatt> Its intrinsic vs extrinsic value
[4:00:05] <Chatterbox1991> wait how am i the hype train conductor?
[4:00:11] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 Doom 2016, a demonic tree flat out says it.
[4:00:11] <brachydios777> @chatterbox1991 I say gradually goes down instead of a style at a time when damaged
[4:00:11] <%LynbellDaYo> I'll definitely replay to get perfect scores
[4:00:17] <rytisone> dmc5 rating system is all over the place
[4:00:23] <ralphfromdk> Oh man, those olden times where games gave your arbitrary points for stuff that didn't do shit or get kept anywhere
[4:00:59] <%ChoculaUltra> idk this convo reminded me of those passwords for the old megaman and megaman x games.
[4:00:59] <%RioGascar> I do wanna say i still love dmc5, if it wasnt for outer wilds it would have been my game of the year last year
[4:01:03] <RichochetForce> Yeah, you play with cutscene shit. It feels so good.
[4:01:15] <derap41> Like Gunz Arena
[4:01:20] <%RioGascar> Nero is best and fun and amazing
[4:01:29] <+paladinstarbuster> Has reggie never played a DMC game?
[4:01:32] <%LordDukeFishington> So like Titanfall 2 incorporated
[4:01:33] <DelgotHansto> The philosophy of if he does in a cutscene you can do it in game made dmc 3
[4:01:41] <@Solidus_113> Did Woolie see that the next League of Legends champion will have a Style meter?
[4:01:44] <RichochetForce> @DelgotHansto Bingo
[4:01:58] <rytisone> do it for the cheevos
[4:02:05] <%ChoculaUltra> still holding out hope on a DMC5 SE.
[4:02:08] <%Shishi1205> he doesnt know I imagine
[4:02:19] <%a_goth_pancake> for cool points
[4:02:22] <RichochetForce> @ChoculaUltra Never give up hope. DMC4 got one 7 years after the original release.
[4:02:23] <venomfury86> i was happy they got rid of the time ranking
[4:02:32] <%seduwu> Vergil DLC pls
[4:02:39] <%VidulaSaix> I hate that shit
[4:02:41] <%VidulaSaix> Makes the game unfun
[4:02:43] <%a_goth_pancake> Vergil dlc when
[4:02:55] <venomfury86> or finish the level in time
[4:02:58] <KeystoneA2> !uptime

[4:03:25] <%RioGascar> the one good reward i find outside of SSSS is going up in style unlocks more taunts

[4:06:57] <RichochetForce> @tearfuldevil Gematsu
[4:06:57] <DatAsuna> Since antifa isn't an actual group, you can say anybody is part of it
[4:06:59] <%eyezehuhh> but you know
[4:07:01] <Tuna_Can_0> Antifers KKona
[4:07:03] <ashenjuan25> USA: Antifa is a terrorist organization. Antifa: we’re an organization?
[4:07:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'M EVEN MORE MAD NOW
[4:07:06] <%Psitterrific> They fractured his skull
[4:07:09] <Halospaz117> You know, I thought being more openly political on this stuff would be a bit awkward, but nah this feels rad to let out
[4:07:10] <DatAsuna> reggie is antifa
[4:07:12] <%eyezehuhh> he asked for it apparently??
[4:07:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Even YOU could be Antifa
[4:07:13] <derap41> Woolie the Police legally doesn't have to protect and serve
[4:07:17] <+Mecha_G> calling antifa a group is like calling anonymous a group
