[0:04:46] <+Feralspirit41> New series; getting into david cage games
[0:04:47] <+WutangchickeN> PLAY OMIKRON WITH REGGIE

[0:05:03] <Mrthefro> Indigo Prophecy with Reggie at the helm. WHEN?
[0:05:03] <%doomerskeletor13> The only good thing David Cage has ever given us is Connor and that’s mostly because of the actors improv

[0:05:15] <+WutangchickeN> PLAY OMIKRON WITH REGGIE!
[0:05:16] <%Asuterisuku> Did you just imply Micheal Bay action is good?
[0:05:19] <@Solidus_113> WHAT IF?
[0:05:19] <+gustavozxd> no, no holocaust analogies, jjust an actual robot holocaust
[0:05:20] <dinnydanny777> Ok now Woolie you say this, but at least Michael Bay is good at making explosions, Cage can't even do that
[0:05:21] <Tha_Mik> Think about it
[0:05:22] <+b_aleph> omikron: the reggie
[0:05:23] <%kyh9> Detroit is to Roots, as Astral Chain is to NGE
[0:05:23] <somekindaspy> oh my god

[0:05:45] <uncle_christian> CAGE KILLS SLOWLY
[0:05:45] <Solidnick18> they had no chairs
[0:05:45] <CryptusMaximus> Imagine if Tommy Wiseau actually got some talented people to make his movie's for him with the same level of writing
[0:05:48] <BlackermanZX> Revolutionary doodMako
[0:05:49] <peachy996> Imagine Roots directed by Michael Bay but with a good buddy cop duo
[0:05:51] <%DesertPenguin> The end of the Detroid LP is has so many Woolie sighs
[0:05:54] <+gustavozxd> what about that song at the ending
[0:05:55] <pennykettle_> its not an analogy for anything its just about robots
[0:05:56] <laguerrilha> racism and slavery
[0:05:57] <somekindaspy> Fool of a French man
[0:05:58] <Asuxley> Woolie should do a lp with Reggie playing it
[0:05:58] <+gustavozxd> IT IS HILARIOUS
[0:05:59] <Visorak6> HE's NOT WRONG
[0:06:02] <%DesertPenguin> So many Woolie sighs
[0:06:02] <king_trito> i still cant believe Kojima stanned for Bowie for so long and still didnt even try to get in one of his games but jumped into a david cage game with no strings

[0:09:44] <+Feralspirit41> Fallen order was tight. Although I felt like there was alot of stuff missing when it came to the teams development
[0:09:51] <%Javaa01> Yeah, they lay some actually decently subtle hints in the dialogue regarding Sam's true origin
[0:10:02] <%DesertPenguin> How is Battlefront 2? It's the free PS+ game this month
[0:10:06] <arkv01> hype guy J
[0:10:09] <%doomerskeletor13> @feralspirit41 Yeah I think since it did well the sequel might get more budget
[0:10:10] <%Livelinne> Eyyyyy a good animu
[0:10:12] <RichochetForce> @Javaa01 Yeah, anyone even half paying attention will start making connections
[0:10:18] <thesickestzak> One Piece :)
[0:10:20] <%seduwu> Battlefront 2 is actually good now
[0:10:20] <joshua_42> It’s okay @desertpenguin
[0:10:21] <Saffry_Ruzin> I remember they cut Harbinger's dialogue in ME3 over the Assuming Direct Control memes
[0:10:34] <%Javaa01> The nerd at the ARC HQ refers to Sam's robo-brain as "All Alien"
[0:10:34] <%Irridium> @DesertPenguin It's in a MUCH better place these days compared to launch.
[0:10:37] <+Feralspirit41> @lewdskeletor13 i hope so they were really all over the place when it came to character development
[0:10:40] <%Asuterisuku> Hey Woolie, did you watch Rokka no Yuusha?
[0:10:41] <pennykettle_> Reddit is down. I'm free
[0:10:45] <%DesertPenguin> Like most DICE games LUL
[0:10:47] <pennykettle_> Chocolate rain PogChamp
[0:10:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If you’re looking for another one off game Woolz, check out The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa. It’s like Kunio-Kun with the aesthetic of Crows/GTO.
[0:10:52] <@Solidus_113> some stay dry and others feel the pain
[0:10:53] <peachy996> @Bighat_The_Star_Nomad I only remember Marauder Shields and Starchild near the end of ME3
[0:10:55] <somekindaspy> The Deluxe Edition artbook calls Sam "The Lucent Defiler" and says "his breath smells not of man".
[0:10:56] <+gustavozxd> @DesertPenguin it's alright I guess, i felt it was too grindy
[0:10:57] <%JustYudha> That was wild
[0:10:58] <uncle_christian> Hilarious update
[0:11:07] <dd44dostivei> he pulled a "strange fruit"
[0:11:08] <pennykettle_> I feel like I half noticed? But I never heard the whole song
[0:11:09] <%doomerskeletor13> I forgot Chocolate Rain existed till it came back now
[0:11:10] <Wolfsophic> coming here from the castle super beast podcast
[0:11:12] <Solidnick18> i never listened to the whole thing before hand
[0:11:13] <%seduwu> Chocolate Rain but people actually listen edition
[0:11:15] <RichochetForce> @somekindaspy That is blatant as fuck. Wow.
[0:11:23] <pennykettle_> haha deep voice man sing song about chocolate rain
[0:11:28] <+McSoliace> same
[0:11:30] <%doomerskeletor13> I was a dumb kid as well
[0:11:32] <%DesertPenguin> Oh snap
[0:11:33] <somekindaspy> @RichochetForce and it's told from the perspective of the demons
[0:11:35] <peachy996> Good ol Tay
[0:11:40] <%DesertPenguin> Pepsi, not Coke. Boooo
[0:11:40] <%seduwu> Hahah he turn away to breathe lol
[0:11:40] <uncle_christian> I knew that song had an issue buried in it.
[0:11:42] <+Feralspirit41> I never got it until now cause i was child
[0:11:42] <Saffry_Ruzin> @peachy996 He's the Reaper that shows up at the final run, doesn't say anything in the entirety of ME3
[0:11:45] <thesickestzak> That is honestly crazy. I was like 16 when that came out and never listened to it past his voice and haha chocolate rain sounds funny
[0:11:47] <dinnydanny777> Wait what's about chocolate rain
[0:11:48] <TheAmazingClaytor> You see that Jimmy Kimmel live performance of it? Hoooo boy.
[0:11:49] <%DesertPenguin> What's it actually about?
[0:11:52] <mark_collins45> Cherry Chocolate Dr. Pepper
[0:11:53] <%Livelinne> I actually teared up on that song. Like damn BibleThump
[0:11:54] <%JustYudha> We were too busy laughing at the memes
[0:11:59] <somekindaspy> yup
[0:12:02] <somekindaspy> me too
[0:12:08] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i WAS LIKE 16
[0:12:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @desertpenguin Institutionalized Racism
[0:12:08] <uncle_christian> HE HAS MORE?💖💖💖
[0:12:10] <pennykettle_> haha man lean away from mic to breathe
[0:12:11] <%doomerskeletor13> What a man
[0:12:13] <peachy996> @Bighat_The_Star_Nomad Oh I know we're all suppose to assume it's Harbinger but it's never stated and it never mattered
[0:12:18] <andrei11dr> This is way to deep
[0:12:20] <peachy996> Fuck ME3 lol
[0:12:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Based
[0:12:25] <thesickestzak> Shit gave me goosebumps last night when I ACTUALLY listened to it
[0:12:27] <%Livelinne> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[0:12:27] <pennykettle_> how do you think tay zonday felt about it being a meme after him trying to spread that message LUL
[0:12:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> OOOOOOH HE SPITTIN HE SPITTIN
[0:12:36] <Solidnick18> i was to young
[0:12:39] <%DesertPenguin> I didn't realize he wrote the song. I thought it was a cover of some random 80s shit
[0:12:43] <pennykettle_> We didn't have enough Insight to hear the true song
[0:12:48] <burthalom3w> gotta listen to chocolate rain now
[0:12:49] <mark_collins45> Cherry Chocolate Raaaaaaain
[0:12:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Insight Gained
[0:12:59] <%DesertPenguin> I'm reading the lyrics now. Holy shit
[0:13:04] <uncle_christian> You didn't catch the content?
[0:13:07] <+Reverend_Roscoe> i turn away from the mic to protest racism
[0:13:15] <%DesertPenguin> You fools!
[0:13:15] <laguerrilha> wait.... ok need to search the lyrics for that
[0:13:15] <Saffry_Ruzin> Yeah, he became irrelevant pretty fast, It's just assumed it's him because of the glowing eyes that are unique to him.
[0:13:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> when did chocolate rain come out? depending on the year I might've been literally 11 years old
[0:13:20] <Artoo_The_Me> Oh god then there’s one guy replying to woolie talkin about chocolate rain
[0:13:21] <uncledoodsauce> ja rule didn't know
[0:13:27] <%the_vedo_show> sbfpSetIn

[0:13:33] <%doomerskeletor13> Foolishness
[0:13:36] <SomersaultJustice> I remember he explained the song a little when he was on tosh.0
[0:13:45] <%Livelinne> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[0:13:48] <laguerrilha> HOLY FUCK
[0:13:53] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL he’s like “GET IT NOW?”
[0:13:54] <SomersaultJustice> but it got played for laughs so the message got lost
[0:13:58] <spidervenomized> @FuqBoiSlim 2007

[0:15:49] <RichochetForce> @jiggy_snipe Oh god, the number of people that don't get the message of the series and just focus on the guns and dumbshit.
[0:15:50] <DelgotHansto> Death Stranding seriously hit that prediction quickly
[0:15:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> More importantly, I think it kind of predicts the ALGORITHMS
[0:15:57] <%the_vedo_show> atpGasm
[0:15:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Well not a lot has changed in terms of the issue since Chocolate Rain came out
[0:16:01] <joshua_42> I just looked up the lyrics holy shit
[0:16:07] <dinnydanny777> The thong song is actually a satire about the rising price of thongs

[0:16:47] <%trustycoyote> Oh shit! That's right!
[0:16:50] <Make_me_mad> I feel like Chocolate Rain is less ahead of its time and more the state of the world hasn't changed since that song was made. Shit sucked then and it sucks now, people just ignored it.
[0:16:51] <Artoo_The_Me> YOOOO
[0:16:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> They did FTP by NEA
[0:16:55] <daemonazaezal> In chicago

[0:17:11] <daemonazaezal> and they took down a minneapolis website
[0:17:23] <DelgotHansto> Chocolate Rain entered my playlist as a joke until I looked it up on Genius, it hit me hard and that was years ago
[0:17:27] <jacob2pop> Oh boy are we talking about that piece of shirt on Twitter

[0:25:48] <%Javaa01> That however is not correct
[0:25:49] <somekindaspy> I feel bad for Id who just wanna make a good game and instead Bethesda make them do all this online stuff
[0:25:51] <+Wiithan6> guys he went to the main menu when he tried it before
[0:25:52] <laguerrilha> @FuqBoiSlim it shows in cutscenes

[0:26:24] <RichochetForce> @Bighat_The_Star_Nomad My guess is DLC
[0:26:24] <somekindaspy> @legacy0117 The whole circles thing doesn't really apply to this hell

[0:26:52] <%Irridium> this one's sick
[0:26:54] <andrei11dr> How come Woolie is quick to sell humanity for jetpacks, but when he has to sell his own soul to Bethesda he just won't do it, hmmmm
[0:27:03] <pennykettle_> you can see doomguy's disgusting face in this skin
[0:27:03] <anne_arkie> oooh a space lizard man
[0:27:05] <megamonmon123> yep
[0:27:07] <%DesertPenguin> This is badass, but his face is more visible and they didn't animate the eyes very well
[0:27:07] <Saffry_Ruzin> Probably, since the DLC areas are literally Urdak and a Tanker
[0:27:09] <+slimmixrp> Marauder wears these too right?

[0:27:26] <%DesertPenguin> It's cool to see the bare hands in the glory kills
[0:27:29] <Saffry_Ruzin> looks bad ass in Cutscenes

[0:28:08] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd

[0:51:24] <%Asuterisuku> How do you know this, Sam?
[0:51:25] <SheefEatsBeef> despite all my rage i am still just a doomguy in a cage
[0:51:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GOOD
[0:51:26] <+dangerillustrated> The first time I entered this cage it threw me out of the world
[0:51:26] <RichochetForce> It's time for Culling 101
[0:51:27] <Dementedpenguin> Boo hoo
[0:51:27] <laguerrilha> fuck her
[0:51:30] <%the_vedo_show> moon2H
[0:51:30] <penitentpentwitch> This feels like a stupid thing to do... that was done in a game previously that Woolie has yet to do.
[0:51:33] <RogueMinja> Fuck her.
[0:51:33] <Hammatime8> Yeah no it's cool fuck hell
[0:51:35] <%dekkitout> How and why's her world dying- what did she do?!
[0:51:36] <roof_pizza84> This level is a literal metal album cover come to life
[0:51:39] <alexandrecau> Send heaven to hell
[0:51:40] <%DesertPenguin> How does "Sam" know all of this stuff?
[0:51:44] <@Solidus_113> BLOOD SWAMP
[0:51:44] <somekindaspy> Heaven is crumbling because the Khan Maykr decided to get rid of god
[0:51:45] <Solidnick18> the blood swamps

[0:52:05] <RogueMinja> Quintuple wrong.
[0:52:05] <%DesertPenguin> INSTANTLY
[0:52:05] <Tha_Mik> Look at this metroid
[0:52:06] <+l3sovikk> This is not a fun room
[0:52:07] <RichochetForce> lol
[0:52:07] <Calek> yeah MOTHER BRAIN
[0:52:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Does Shrek live in the Blood Swamp

[0:52:08] <peachy996> what a bitch
[0:52:09] <%SuperKirby24> Mother brain LUL
[0:52:11] <%DesertPenguin> Arbalest
[0:52:11] <BeNiceImShy> Wait...'if you take away her reasons, she did it for no reason????'
[0:52:12] <RichochetForce> Woolie got it immediately
[0:52:12] <somekindaspy> CODEX
[0:52:17] <roof_pizza84> He's even got the Mother Brain cheerios
[0:52:18] <%emperordread> Devil Games
[0:52:18] <SpaceGuntank> its shooting fruit loops!
[0:52:19] <pennykettle_> those cracks spoil so many cool moments in the game LUL
[0:52:19] <Solidnick18> mother brain wooo
[0:52:19] <%Asuterisuku> Time to blind the Sightless Judge.
[0:52:20] <megamonmon123> IT SUPER IS
[0:52:22] <CryptusMaximus> You like Metroid kids!
[0:52:23] <somekindaspy> wait what
[0:52:23] <%gamewarden92> Mother Brain temping for hell\
[0:52:27] <peachy996> This is a bug
[0:52:29] <somekindaspy> oh it's a bug
[0:52:30] <%Josef_Stryker> MUTHERRRR
[0:52:30] <%DesertPenguin> Use the Arbalest to take those things out quickly
[0:52:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bug
[0:52:31] <SomersaultJustice> the baby is on the way
[0:52:32] <uncle_christian> When he fused with the DOOM satellite his knowledge leveled up.
[0:52:33] <somekindaspy> it was a cut codex entry
[0:52:36] <phantalime> this entry is bugged for me
[0:52:37] <%Javaa01> It'll show up once you kill it
[0:52:39] <jorniev> i hope metroid prime 4 is good
[0:52:39] <laguerrilha> its a bug, there is no codex
[0:52:40] <BlackermanZX> oh wow its literally mother brain LUL
[0:52:41] <Solidnick18> probably gotta kill it
[0:52:47] <penitentpentwitch> Isn't this the 'sightless judge'?
[0:52:48] <%DesertPenguin> How does Woolie get the most bugged version
[0:52:48] <somekindaspy> they cut the codex entry for it for some reason
[0:52:49] <%DesertPenguin> LUL
[0:52:56] <Solidnick18> oh
[0:52:56] <RichochetForce> @penitentpentwitch Yes
[0:52:57] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[0:52:57] <somekindaspy> shoot the eyes
[0:52:58] <alexandrecau> not a bug it's in story of hell
[0:52:59] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[0:53:04] <laguerrilha> they forgot to cut that codex warning as well
[0:53:04] <Hammatime8> Yo I want an entry on this mother brain tho
[0:53:06] <%DesertPenguin> Weird
[0:53:09] <%DesertPenguin> Shoot orb
[0:53:09] <%doomerskeletor13> I had like no bugs in my game
[0:53:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dekkitout They are bypassing the usual process where the Khan Maykr basically dies/reincarnates after thousands of years and gets replaced by another one. They're also using Argent for other advantages.
[0:53:15] <pennykettle_> probably cut the entry because they called it the sightless judge but explicitly has 4 eyes
[0:53:16] <peachy996> I got the same thing
[0:53:17] <somekindaspy> ballista
[0:53:23] <%DesertPenguin> Ballista is your friend
[0:53:25] <TheAmazingClaytor> SourPls
[0:53:29] <@Solidus_113> watch out for the cheerios

[0:53:35] <spidervenomized> samus the doomslayer
[0:53:36] <Hal10k> The concept art for Kalibas looks way different so it probably went through some major revision midway through development
[0:53:40] <somekindaspy> @GeneralSCPatton Correct. The Angels used to be immortal until this last Khan wanted to live and rule forever
[0:53:42] <%gundam_fighter_kenshiro> did the baby Metroid get lost, how's Woolie gonna kill mother brain now?
[0:53:47] <%Asuterisuku> And now the Gargoyles have spawned.
[0:53:48] <+redux_014> Is this on easy? (just curious)
[0:53:50] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:53:51] <@Solidus_113> normal
[0:53:53] <%DesertPenguin> There it is
[0:53:53] <Tha_Mik> The baby
[0:53:55] <+redux_014> ok
[0:53:55] <CryptusMaximus> With how much this game takes from the Prime games, I'm not surprised they just straight up made a Mother Brain boss
[0:53:58] <%Asuterisuku> Hurt Me Plenty.
[0:53:59] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s on hurt me plenty
[0:54:00] <peachy996> @redux_014 Hurt Me Plenty
[0:54:01] <%DesertPenguin> I was about to say the Pain Elemental was taking awhile to show up

[0:54:19] <pennykettle_> @Hal10k link to concept art?
[0:54:20] <somekindaspy> arbalest the pain elementals, they die way faster that way
[0:54:21] <%jubejube56> Last Resort might not be the most timely song
[0:54:24] <somekindaspy> you have destroyer blade out
[0:54:25] <%Asuterisuku> Never stop moving, Woolie.
[0:54:26] <Hammatime8> More like SLAIN elemental. Because it's dead.
[0:54:26] <Solidnick18> oh no
[0:54:27] <%DesertPenguin> noooooo
[0:54:30] <%DesertPenguin> Health behind you
[0:54:31] <%Josef_Stryker> RIP

[0:54:40] <%DesertPenguin> Worth it
[0:54:41] <somekindaspy> gotta pop the eyes
[0:54:47] <roof_pizza84> So was Alien/Khan Sam the same person who went on to become CEO of the UAC?
[0:54:50] <uncle_christian> Woolie is literally on fire
[0:54:58] <@Solidus_113> PUNCH IT
[0:54:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Well at least you grabbed that extra life earlier
[0:55:00] <Solidnick18> Punch it
[0:55:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:55:02] <%DesertPenguin> lul
[0:55:04] <%DesertPenguin> Punch everything
[0:55:07] <Solidnick18> eat shit
[0:55:08] <%Asuterisuku> Now you can read the codex entry.
[0:55:09] <TheAmazingClaytor> Eat Dicks, Brain!
[0:55:10] <%gundam_fighter_kenshiro> punch the fire
[0:55:12] <%dekkitout> Huge head-guts
[0:55:14] <+redux_014> I realize now that nightmare is a significant jump in difficulty
[0:55:15] <spidervenomized> rip mother brain
[0:55:16] <DelgotHansto> I wonder if we all have a green breakable symbol on our brains
[0:55:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> *Mario 64 scream*
[0:55:17] <%SuperKirby24> wait you get blown back by that? Kappa
[0:55:17] <%the_vedo_show> atpHorns
[0:55:17] <%DesertPenguin> That was fun
[0:55:19] <dinnydanny777> Exposed live on stream
[0:55:20] <Hammatime8> A punch so hard that you RECOILED BACKWARDS FROM THE FORCE
[0:55:22] <uncle_christian> Brain got Back
[0:55:23] <alexandrecau> @roof_pizza84 It's unclear if he got bodyjacked when he turned robot or it was all a ruse
[0:55:24] <heart_ablaze> brain go boom
[0:55:24] <peachy996> Oh you can read the codex entry?
[0:55:25] <somekindaspy> @roof_pizza84 he technologically implanted his consciousness into Hayden's mind. Remember that during the construction of the Argent Tower, he very randomly and suddenly got stage 4 inoperable brain cancer.
[0:55:26] <pennykettle_> soo uhhh how important was this guy? Doesnt he judge all souls
[0:55:27] <%DesertPenguin> It's like an old school gaming experience. Go figure
[0:55:28] <laguerrilha> we need more brain mosnters
[0:55:30] <%Irridium> try looking for the codex one now it should be in story of hell. unless I'm crazy and just imagined the whole thing
[0:55:36] <%DesertPenguin> They made a modern game feel classic
[0:55:48] <+IncredibleMeh> If you need a good diss just tell someone "Ya'll Calibus cause' you sightlessly judging."
[0:55:52] <%DesertPenguin> Being a shitty person
[0:55:55] <Taarin> YOU'LL FIND OUT WOOLIE
[0:55:56] <spidervenomized> soul

[0:55:58] <RichochetForce> @DesertPenguin They understood, truly understood the feeling and pace of older games
[0:56:01] <Solidnick18> time for the stuff
[0:56:02] <%Javaa01> If your soul is too shit, it's not worth ripping
[0:56:05] <roof_pizza84> @somekindaspy Oh shit that's a good point, I didn't realize that's what could've happened.
[0:56:11] <pennykettle_> gamers are sent to the blood swamps

[0:56:38] <%Asuterisuku> R.E.G. Upgraded.
[0:56:40] <+dangerillustrated> like what do they do with the souls who are just like "Eh, it's whatever"
[0:56:41] <somekindaspy> @roof_pizza84 also, he appeared out of the argent fracture. which means that he dragged himself out from the core of mars from the hebeth portal
[0:56:45] <scrumbotime> The demons show you feet and how you react determines what they do
[0:56:49] <%dekkitout> They torture the foot fetishists, I bet tajC
[0:56:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @pennykettle_ All he does is decide which souls are juicy enough to be annihilated in the factory. Everyone else gets thrown in a blood swamp and probably ceases to exist eventually anyways.

[0:58:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie has internalized the Green Button as something that it's not, it's too late
[0:58:39] <BlackermanZX> heat blast you use quite a bit

[0:58:47] <@Solidus_113> Max out Arbalest if there's nothing else. It's a really good mod
[0:58:47] <Eightesu> But full auto is op
[0:58:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dual lock on is meh
[0:58:47] <%Javaa01> Lock On mastery really isn't worth it
[0:58:51] <%DesertPenguin> this
[0:58:53] <%DesertPenguin> get this
[0:58:56] <somekindaspy> @GeneralSCPatton they still become demons. they just become demons naturally instead of being processed
[0:58:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that one's good
[0:58:57] <laguerrilha> heat blast is great
[0:58:57] <+l3sovikk> Heat Blast is fucking rad!
[0:58:58] <Tha_Mik> Nice
[0:59:00] <penitentpentwitch> I liked heat blast, free damage for no ammo
[0:59:01] <%DesertPenguin> AOE
[0:59:03] <Solidnick18> heat blast is amazing
[0:59:07] <%Javaa01> Heat Blast is a PRIME skip
[0:59:12] <somekindaspy> @GeneralSCPatton remember, it happens as 'slow and laborious process'
[0:59:12] <%Asuterisuku> All the weapons are useful.
[0:59:13] <%Javaa01> Cause that challenge sucks ass
[0:59:15] <Solidnick18> it gives you a big buff
[0:59:15] <Monkeyweed21> The plasma gun is alot better in this game
[0:59:19] <RichochetForce> Heat blast is really strong
[0:59:21] <%jubejube56> It helps that it no longer shares ammo with the Gauss Cannon
[0:59:22] <somekindaspy> *naturally
[0:59:23] <RichochetForce> getting a buff from it is even better
[0:59:25] <%DesertPenguin> DO IT
[0:59:28] <+apieceofwonderbread> love heat blast
[0:59:31] <roof_pizza84> Remote Detonation is really useful AoE
[0:59:35] <Taarin> I got a lot of mileage out of Instant Salvo
[0:59:36] <RichochetForce> @roof_pizza84 Yup
[0:59:37] <BlackermanZX> arbalest is cool too
[0:59:37] <%Javaa01> Arbalest is trivial to master
[0:59:42] <jorniev> unmakyr should be more like the titanfall smart gun
[0:59:43] <RichochetForce> This is GREAT
[0:59:44] <Solidnick18> hmmmm
[0:59:46] <somekindaspy> Woolie and Reggie, those big green things trigger the spike traps. You gotta use those for the challenge! @WoolieVersus
[0:59:46] <laguerrilha> you never need that many n ariw
[0:59:47] <%DesertPenguin> but its easy to do
[0:59:50] <%Asuterisuku> Cacodemons are everywhere.
[0:59:50] <Hammatime8> That sounds GOOD
[0:59:52] <%JustYudha> LOL
[0:59:53] <@Solidus_113> you have 2 tokens

[1:00:06] <uncle_christian> Wall ST Smart Reg
[1:00:06] <koolaid_kevster> LUL
[1:00:06] <alexandrecau> Reggie goign for the jugular
[1:00:10] <spidervenomized> CurseLit CurseLit that burn
[1:00:16] <%Javaa01> Energy shield is trivial to master as well
[1:00:18] <%DesertPenguin> you never use shield tho
[1:00:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that seems easy
[1:00:22] <%Javaa01> 20k
[1:00:23] <%wolfofsound> woolie's ball completely exposed
[1:00:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shield is trivial to master
[1:00:26] <laguerrilha> look at the preview of the mastery
[1:00:27] <TheAmazingClaytor> Shield is EZ mission
[1:00:29] <DelgotHansto> Theres only like 20 cacos left in the game
[1:00:29] <%Javaa01> Very easy to get
[1:00:29] <+JustToWatch> very easy
[1:00:32] <BlackermanZX> sounds easy to do
[1:00:32] <+greenfall> easy to master
[1:00:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> try it
[1:00:33] <%dekkitout> That's quite a bit of damage
[1:00:34] <megamonmon123> very easy
[1:00:36] <RogueMinja> Very easy.
[1:00:37] <%Javaa01> It is a low number
[1:00:46] <@Solidus_113> Heat Blast for sure
[1:00:50] <%DesertPenguin> yup
[1:00:52] <alexandrecau> There is still a few mastery token right?
[1:00:55] <Solidnick18> i say heat blast
[1:00:59] <RichochetForce> Heat Blast
[1:01:03] <somekindaspy> @alexandrecau yep. there's more ahead
[1:01:03] <%DesertPenguin> heat first
[1:01:07] <RichochetForce> Arbalest is easy to do
[1:01:07] <%Irridium> full auto maxed is basically the minigun but for shotgun blasts if you use it right
[1:01:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Heat blast is disgustingly good
[1:01:11] <@Solidus_113> you haven't used Arbalest at all
[1:01:11] <%Javaa01> For context, that quad damage alone you had in the arena prior can get you 14k damage alone
[1:01:15] <somekindaspy> Arbalest is easy to do, yeah
[1:01:17] <Ner234> I thought the full auto was good?
[1:01:20] <TheAmazingClaytor> Chain gun Shield is an easy mission
[1:01:21] <%DesertPenguin> but you should
[1:01:24] <%Javaa01> Shield is incredible
[1:01:29] <+Feralspirit41> Energy shield is literally use gun while the shield is active
[1:01:31] <megamonmon123> shield is easy to get
[1:01:33] <somekindaspy> You haven't used arbalest! You've been using the destroyer blade
[1:01:34] <+JustToWatch> shield mastery is super easy
[1:01:35] <Taarin> The shield is a free breather
[1:01:36] <laguerrilha> When you are surrounded or with low HP the shield is great
[1:01:38] <%DesertPenguin> Shield is a viable option
[1:01:40] <+McSoliace> lock-on rockets do stupid damage
[1:01:44] <@Solidus_113> you'll fight a lot in this level
[1:01:44] <somekindaspy> big green button is a spike trap
[1:01:49] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie, hit the button.
[1:01:50] <%blue2red> woolieSMUG
[1:01:51] <+nintega010> full auto you get amo

[1:09:21] <RichochetForce> Yeah, this place has 3 levels to fight in
[1:09:22] <%Josef_Stryker> Weakness: SWORD
[1:09:26] <%Asuterisuku> Archvile eats Crucible/BFGs.

[1:10:24] <%DesertPenguin> Try to lure everything under the smash cube
[1:10:26] <RichochetForce> @DesertPenguin That's a top tier selection. They're constantly up if you know the loop well
[1:10:29] <RogueMinja> Is there BFG ammo in this room? I forget.
[1:10:43] <RichochetForce> @RogueMinja Yes, in the big room at the top
[1:10:46] <%DesertPenguin> @RichochetForce I've been suggesting it every stream and I don't get a response LUL

[1:14:27] <WanderingSwordsman> Doom makes me emotional too
[1:14:29] <DelgotHansto> When watching a screen, you blink 60% less

[1:15:27] <@Solidus_113> grab the BFG ammo, freeze him, and delete

[1:17:09] <somekindaspy> you're in hell, there's going to be a lot of fuck-rooms
[1:17:14] <%Ashenik1> Quite Interesting: When you move your eyes there is no continous vision but quick cuts inbetween. You become blind for that fraction of a second when you change the point you are looking at.
[1:17:26] <%DesertPenguin> Use the smash cube
[1:17:30] <somekindaspy> he is here
[1:17:40] <Madbearv> doesn't that neon hurt your eyes woolie

[1:17:55] <%DesertPenguin> I don't think that worked
[1:17:57] <RichochetForce> @Ashenik1 Yeah, this tripped me out when I first found out. Also, your brain makes up information, like a strange biological version of temporal rendering techniques
[1:17:59] <somekindaspy> kill it
[1:18:01] <+MajiOMNI> you missed
[1:18:01] <%KingVantq> it did some damage to him
[1:18:03] <somekindaspy> blood punch the shield
[1:18:06] <%DesertPenguin> You gotta use that point blank range behind the shield
[1:18:06] <peachy996> You missed him

[1:27:09] <somekindaspy> @laguerrilha no it isn't. it's a guaranteed stun.
[1:27:10] <peachy996> oh don't pass up the heat blast for Beam
[1:27:10] <%Javaa01> Without a skip
[1:27:10] <DelgotHansto> How dumb, doesnt even have legs. TOSSED
[1:27:12] <RichochetForce> Heatblast, avoid Microwave.
[1:27:16] <%Asuterisuku> It's more than half way there and you just started using it, the shield is trivial.
[1:27:20] <@Solidus_113> don't shortcut the shield
[1:27:23] <somekindaspy> @laguerrilha a kill with it will cause secondary explosions.
[1:27:27] <megamonmon123> dont shortcut shield
[1:27:34] <%DesertPenguin> So easy
[1:27:37] <RichochetForce> Easy as hell
[1:27:43] <%DesertPenguin> Just do the heat blast

[1:28:32] <RichochetForce> Yes!
[1:28:35] <Monkeyweed21> @Ashenik1 against THOSE people yes
[1:28:36] <%DesertPenguin> Heat Blast is a big AOE. That's really useful when you get swarmed

[1:53:03] <%dekkitout> Not for a jetpack psaCrazyhand

[1:54:46] <+anthonywilde1994> back kill is pain in the asss
[1:54:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Only ONE Archvile
[1:54:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> HELL NO
[1:54:52] <resloxxx> Kappa
[1:54:54] <RichochetForce> The Tyrant's is actually fairly easy
[1:54:57] <+slimmixrp> Third sucks cause you can't just sword him immeidately
[1:54:58] <%Asuterisuku> Only ONE Tyrant.
[1:55:00] <RichochetForce> Archvile's is a problem, yeah.
[1:55:02] <@Solidus_113> you don't even have to do these anymore, you used all the batteries
[1:55:03] <%blue2red> woolieGLORY
[1:55:10] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus There is ONLY ONE Tyrant on this map

[1:55:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Solidus_113 But the OCD
[1:55:16] <RichochetForce> I suspect there will be more battery usage in the DLCs
[1:55:16] <+anthonywilde1994> 1 shot
[1:55:20] <RichochetForce> Same thing for weapons
[1:55:21] <%DesertPenguin> You can ignore these now you have everything unlocked

[1:55:22] <+anthonywilde1994> 1 oppurtunity
[1:55:28] <Solidnick18> i think
[1:55:35] <+anthonywilde1994> mums spaghetti
[1:55:35] <%Javaa01> Multiple tyrants, only one archvile
[1:55:38] <somekindaspy> @legacy0117 no, wrong. You don't go to hell if you're a bad person in this universe. You go to hell if hell invades your world and drags your world into hell
[1:55:39] <%Asuterisuku> Also only one Archvile.

[2:15:49] <%doomerskeletor13> The good shit
[2:15:49] <+l3sovikk> Archvile in this room
[2:15:50] <Taarin> He's getting a robo chudder for this
[2:15:51] <RichochetForce> And there it is.
[2:15:51] <%Javaa01> Necrons
[2:15:53] <dukenux> How It's Made: demons
[2:15:59] <BlackermanZX> doodWAT
[2:16:03] <Taarin> It's a goddamn soulnado
[2:16:08] <penitentpentwitch> Heaven gets Argent Energy, Demons get more soldiers. Win win.
[2:16:12] <%DesertPenguin> There's another big bad in this room that Woolie always has trouble with
[2:16:13] <Calek> other way
[2:16:13] <%MayorRev> Can't explain that!
[2:16:14] <somekindaspy> It was mixing Blue AND RED
[2:16:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Demons are Nobodies, and Argent Energy is Heartless, got it
[2:16:15] <%Javaa01> No, it was red energy go in, blue come out
[2:16:16] <VJdarkworld> :O
[2:16:16] <+slimmixrp> Red to blue
[2:16:19] <Kaji04> That's how the cola gets extracted, and them you combine it with the carbonated water
[2:16:20] <%kyh9> HUMAN SOULS
[2:16:20] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuPog breebuPog breebuPog
[2:16:20] <dinnydanny777> It's Mako
[2:16:22] <gasmaskguypp> DrinkPurple
[2:16:22] <RichochetForce> Red to blue, Woolie.
[2:16:23] <uncle_christian> Sam didn't have to
[2:16:24] <resloxxx> red to blue
[2:16:25] <+slimmixrp> MAKO LOL
[2:16:26] <dinnydanny777> It's basically Mako
[2:16:27] <roof_pizza84> Red to Blue
[2:16:32] <RichochetForce> It's Torture Mako
[2:16:32] <dinnydanny777> It's the lifestream
[2:16:33] <dukenux> @penitentpentwitch THE WAR ECONOMY
[2:16:38] <@Solidus_113> you're fighting humans!
[2:16:42] <RichochetForce> Agony Lifestream
[2:16:43] <%kyh9> Was Sam purifying souls?
[2:16:45] <xbb1024> Yeah, Sam was selling it back to Earth
[2:16:46] <%dekkitout> So he was only pissed that Liv was cutting into his profit
[2:16:46] <Tha_Mik> The plaqnet is dying Doomguy!
[2:16:50] <roof_pizza84> Argent Energy is PEOPLE
[2:16:55] <DelgotHansto> Torture Mako for Hell ShinRa a.k.a The U.A.C
[2:16:57] <RichochetForce> @kyh9 We do this for the BETTERMENT of mankind.
[2:16:59] <%DesertPenguin> Soylent Green
[2:17:05] <uncle_christian> Scientist do not believe in Heaven n Hell
[2:17:06] <somekindaspy> I'm pretty sure he's the one who invented Argent Energy, as the Khan and her "Scolaris" and the Order Deag figured it out
[2:17:07] <CryptusMaximus> Hell is suffering
[2:17:09] <dukenux> Argent Green
[2:17:09] <BlackermanZX> Hell is pretty good at recycling
[2:17:16] <%MayorRev> BibleThump
[2:17:17] <dukenux> or Soylent Blue
[2:17:18] <rytisone> bombing mission intensifies
[2:17:20] <%dekkitout> Hell is 100% resource efficient- nothing goes to waste
[2:17:21] <Kaji04> are you killing people or freeing them
[2:17:22] <%DesertPenguin> Turning people into demons is just evolution, man
[2:17:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:17:27] <roof_pizza84> @dukenux Argent Green sounds good
[2:17:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hell uses every part of the victim

[2:22:55] <Solidnick18> it's hard took me awhile
[2:22:55] <somekindaspy> BFG would not kill him!
[2:22:56] <Kaji04> Don't give up, stay MOTIVATED Woolie
[2:23:02] <%DesertPenguin> Oh yea, if you wanna do the optional keep trying
[2:23:02] <somekindaspy> BFG does not kill him, it just takes out most of his health
[2:23:03] <uncle_christian> Maud taps toe and stares at watch
[2:23:04] <roof_pizza84> Using remote detonation will stagger the archvile
[2:23:05] <RichochetForce> BFG does not instakill Super-Heavies
[2:23:07] <+RyanTheRecluse> ice and one or two rocket barrages
[2:23:08] <+segmentedfool> He does not die to bfg
[2:23:10] <megamonmon123> woolie, fuck the challenge
[2:23:13] <somekindaspy> He does not die to one bfg
[2:23:17] <%DesertPenguin> You sure?
[2:23:19] <Solidnick18> nice
[2:23:20] <uncle_christian> huzah
[2:23:25] <somekindaspy> positive
[2:23:31] <%DesertPenguin> Does it put him into glory state or just stagger?
[2:23:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Gordon, I do believe we have wiped out the entire army of hell
[2:23:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THIS PARTY'S GETTIN CRAZY
[2:23:37] <megamonmon123> he didnt die last time he used the bfg
[2:23:44] <heart_ablaze> yes
[2:23:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> yes
[2:23:46] <RichochetForce> It just damages them heavily
[2:23:47] <%Josef_Stryker> It won't
[2:23:52] <%DesertPenguin> What if you hit him direct hit?
[2:23:57] <somekindaspy> really? the bfg "missed"?
[2:23:58] <+green715> Just dont direct hit
[2:24:00] <%Josef_Stryker> Super Heavy Demons will tank BFG
[2:24:00] <%KingVantq> A direct hit kills
[2:24:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[2:24:03] <+YabbaTroll> the bfg does not miss
[2:24:05] <%DesertPenguin> That's what I mean. Direct hit is what I was thinking of
[2:24:07] <peachy996> But If he hits him directly and he is on Hurt Me Plenty
[2:24:07] <roof_pizza84> I think direct hit of BFG kills
[2:24:08] <RogueMinja> If it hits the shield, it might survive.
[2:24:10] <uncle_christian> Eeek
[2:24:23] <resloxxx> LUL
[2:24:27] <Visorak6> Blood punch the little people
[2:24:28] <somekindaspy> he's up top
[2:24:29] <umbrellaswereawesome> Yeah, I think it's like the Marauder where a direct hit kills.
[2:24:30] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Super Heavy class enemies WILL NOT die to BFG tendrils raw, you have to direct hit them from range to instantly kill with the BFG
[2:24:30] <megamonmon123> why nit
[2:24:35] <%DesertPenguin> BFG the Archvile but miss him so he only gets the electricity
[2:24:35] <%gamewarden92> Reggie condones punching small people and children.
[2:24:45] <Maids4lyfe> he was there
[2:24:46] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus use that rocket lock on
[2:24:49] <%Josef_Stryker> Did he just miss him?
[2:24:54] <somekindaspy> he was up top
[2:24:55] <raikagelord1> Up top
[2:24:56] <Maids4lyfe> HE WAS ON THE TOP
[2:24:57] <roof_pizza84> He was up top
[2:24:57] <CoffeeSlice> :0
[2:24:57] <uncle_christian> yes
[2:24:58] <%HostilePoundcakes> up
[2:24:58] <Solidnick18> he's up top
[2:24:59] <+slimmixrp> You walked past him
[2:25:00] <RichochetForce> He's on the second level
[2:25:00] <raikagelord1> By reveant
[2:25:00] <+slimmixrp> Up top
[2:25:00] <%Javaa01> You totally missed him
[2:25:01] <+RyanTheRecluse> you walked right past him
[2:25:01] <RogueMinja> Top.
[2:25:01] <Maids4lyfe> HE DOESN'T GLOW
[2:25:02] <peachy996> BERSERKER Barrage!
[2:25:02] <RichochetForce> Surrounded by a fire shield
[2:25:03] <+slimmixrp> He spawns on top
[2:25:03] <Taarin> He was up top throwing fire pillars
[2:25:05] <%DesertPenguin> BFG works if you use the electricty, like when you don't get a direct hit
[2:25:06] <roof_pizza84> He was the dude who threw fire at you
[2:25:09] <DelgotHansto> Wait I thought he was running away he was right there
[2:25:10] <uncle_christian> Get high ground
[2:25:10] <+Bonerlord911> YOU LITERALLY LOOKED AT HIM
[2:25:16] <%seduwu> you walked right past him lol
[2:25:16] <Maids4lyfe> he was right there
[2:25:17] <somekindaspy> he's a teleporting little bitch so it's fine
[2:25:18] <Solidnick18> it's where he always spawns
[2:25:19] <Taarin> Floated past him in slo mo
[2:25:20] <%Irridium> the umakyr would eat him up
[2:25:21] <SixthSun2> He was on the high ground
[2:25:22] <brachydios777> NotLikeThis
[2:25:26] <heart_ablaze> the BFG tendrils will damage the revenant A LOT but won't kill it.
[2:25:27] <raikagelord1> He throws fire walls
[2:25:27] <rytisone> I wish enemies had custom finishers on you like in 2016
[2:25:29] <megamonmon123> Yes
[2:25:29] <SixthSun2> He was right where the Revenant there
[2:25:33] <+nintega010> there was a healthpack, but can understand in the moment not seeing it
[2:25:34] <megamonmon123> you super missed him
[2:25:37] <raikagelord1> Look for fire blast

[2:26:26] <RogueMinja> So the vile comes out once you kill the knife guy.
[2:26:35] <somekindaspy> dont focus on the guys teleporting in
[2:26:36] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:26:38] <DelgotHansto> Feel like rockets are gonna kill the fuck out of it
[2:26:39] <+Bonerlord911> JUST USE THE SWORD ON HIM
[2:26:41] <%DesertPenguin> Try the shield instead
[2:26:43] <somekindaspy> ugh where is he
[2:26:57] <%gamewarden92> This is frantic!
[2:27:11] <somekindaspy> dead

[2:27:17] <%Livelinne> wooliePOYO_UN wooliePOYO_UN wooliePOYO_UN
[2:27:17] <+slimmixrp> Woolie you can't kill the guys teleporting in until they spawn

[2:27:20] <%Josef_Stryker> MORTIS
[2:27:21] <RichochetForce> CHAOS REIGNS
[2:27:21] <somekindaspy> Damn man, this arena is rough
[2:27:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @gamewarden92 Fran-tic-tic-tok
[2:27:27] <+Shin_true92> use the sword dude
[2:27:32] <%DesertPenguin> Use both grenades more
[2:27:33] <Maids4lyfe> use the bfg it won't kill him
[2:27:35] <uncle_christian> Sword for Maud
[2:27:36] <RichochetForce> @somekindaspy Yeah, Nekravol stops playing
[2:27:38] <%DesertPenguin> switch back and forth, yea
[2:27:40] <%seduwu> the sword didn’t count as a glory kill
[2:27:41] <%Javaa01> Because your binds are shit
[2:27:42] <%DesertPenguin> always be switchin
[2:27:43] <+Yamchadassist> i just stuck too ice
[2:27:43] <%Javaa01> Fix that
[2:27:44] <+anthonywilde1994> do what i do /ignore if they glow red :P
[2:27:48] <%DesertPenguin> lol
[2:27:50] <+Bonerlord911> marauders are easier to fight than archviles
[2:27:52] <Maids4lyfe> he can't use sword, he needs to glory kill
[2:27:53] <megamonmon123> try the bfg
[2:27:56] <peachy996> lol
[2:27:56] <umbrellaswereawesome> Don't worry about optimal weapons when he's summoning; just stagger him to kill the summons.
[2:27:57] <VJdarkworld> damn
[2:27:58] <+Bonerlord911> i save all my crucible for archviles
[2:27:58] <DelgotHansto> Make sure to pin him down asap as he spawns those demons in
[2:28:04] <uncle_christian> ice and brr
[2:28:04] <%Asuterisuku> This room is one of the hardest in the game. You can do this, Woolie.
[2:28:06] <Taarin> Or blow him up with rockets?
[2:28:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> uh oh
[2:28:11] <raikagelord1> The director said it was hard to switch to frags.
[2:28:13] <grimshuck> Map it to L3
[2:28:16] <RichochetForce> @Asuterisuku Echoing this
[2:28:17] <+Bonerlord911> haha shoulda played on PC
[2:28:17] <%DesertPenguin> Try to do the freeze first so you have time to switch to the other one
[2:28:17] <Taarin> You have a lot of options to murder things Woolie
[2:28:17] <%HostilePoundcakes> try bumper jumper
[2:28:19] <mark_collins45> Don't focus on the enemies phasing in. Focus all your effort on Archie.
[2:28:20] <%Javaa01> Slayer Controller
[2:28:26] <+NumeroHoowan> M+KB definitely makes combat flow optimal
[2:28:29] <%DesertPenguin> Freeze first so you have time to switch
[2:28:33] <%seduwu> L3?
[2:28:34] <raikagelord1> Director said L3
[2:28:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> Custom PogChamp
[2:28:41] <+NumeroHoowan> Feels a little limited on gamepad
[2:28:45] <DelgotHansto> All you bumper jumper people deserve to die, I should now being one
[2:28:45] <%Javaa01> L3
[2:28:47] <%DesertPenguin> What would you change it for though?
[2:28:50] <%DesertPenguin> There's too many things to do
[2:28:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> l3
[2:28:52] <%Asuterisuku> Keyboard does feel better, yeah.
[2:28:59] <@Solidus_113> What I do when I need to let go of the D-Pad is jump beforehand, so I'm still moving while I reach for the swap
[2:29:03] <raikagelord1> L3
[2:29:03] <%DesertPenguin> Give it a shot
[2:29:11] <%DesertPenguin> @Solidus_113 great idea
[2:29:12] <+anthonywilde1994> L3 IS JUMP
[2:29:15] <uncle_christian> controller for me
[2:29:15] <@Solidus_113> or dash

[2:30:54] <%Josef_Stryker> RIP
[2:30:57] <MasterTonberry23> PROTIP: To survive this encounter, dont get hit Kappa
[2:30:57] <+Yamchadassist> man fuck this challenge
[2:30:59] <uncle_christian> ugh
[2:31:00] <%DesertPenguin> New tactics?
[2:31:00] <somekindaspy> bro if you let the archvile live too long it starts summoning marauders
[2:31:00] <%Asuterisuku> Carcass is Heavy, Woolie.
[2:31:02] <%seduwu> Oof
[2:31:07] <Kei_Ar_> why dont you just meathook into arch
[2:31:07] <DelgotHansto> Ass is being eaten
[2:31:14] <raikagelord1> Tough room
[2:31:15] <+anthonywilde1994> ooo grenade switch l3?
[2:31:17] <%HostilePoundcakes> Try putting on the saving throw rune
[2:31:22] <%DesertPenguin> Seriously
[2:31:22] <somekindaspy> OH!
[2:31:23] <RichochetForce> Ah, so ammo is the issue
[2:31:24] <VJdarkworld> switch
[2:31:24] <%DesertPenguin> Saving Throw is the best
[2:31:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> Fuck the carcass I hate those shields
[2:31:25] <rytisone> it's RAW
[2:31:25] <somekindaspy> That's a good idea!
[2:31:29] <MasterTonberry23> Tough room am I right? swish
[2:31:30] <%DesertPenguin> It's an extra life when you don't have
[2:31:32] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus try switching up your runes?
[2:31:37] <uncle_christian> Those challenges raised Woolies hopes for easy game
[2:31:43] <%Javaa01> If you break off you die
[2:31:44] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Saving Throw is an extra life when you don't have one. Use it for this room
[2:31:47] <+TheBigTaco> Archvile is the main painpoint
[2:31:50] <DelgotHansto> You have to completely ignore the bufff demons and take him out in seconds
[2:31:54] <%Javaa01> You do not have time to fuck around when an archvile is on the field
[2:32:00] <%Javaa01> You have to focus it
[2:32:03] <DelgotHansto> UNMAKYR is actually ashout here

[2:32:15] <snakest3alth> This is RAW
[2:32:15] <%Asuterisuku> This room railed me hard playing on UV.
[2:32:15] <DelgotHansto> ITS BLOODY RAW
[2:32:18] <uncle_christian> ECW
[2:32:24] <RichochetForce> @DelgotHansto He might accidentally kill it. Unmakyr melts singal targets
[2:32:26] <RichochetForce> single*
[2:32:28] <%Asuterisuku> Watch for the Marauder.
[2:32:31] <Taarin> Archvile's pointing to the Wrestlemania sign
[2:32:33] <peachy996> Yes Samuel?
[2:32:40] <peachy996> Weird bug lol
[2:32:43] <%DesertPenguin> I don't think he's gotten far enough to have the Marauder spawn LUL
[2:33:02] <somekindaspy> He did at first
[2:33:08] <peachy996> I thought the Marauder spawns if you kill the revenant up top
[2:33:08] <somekindaspy> but this room is exhausting
[2:33:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> seeing woolie spend ammo on summons is killing me
[2:33:18] <DelgotHansto> @RichochetForce I thinkhes just as likely to kill it with that lock on burst
[2:33:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> esp rockets
[2:33:22] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:33:27] <somekindaspy> BFG
[2:33:28] <%Asuterisuku> Zombie over there he could've chainsawed.
[2:33:30] <Taarin> USE ANOTHER WEAPON WOOLIE
[2:33:30] <%DesertPenguin> LUL
[2:33:34] <somekindaspy> Bro just use the BFG
[2:33:35] <+anthonywilde1994> kills 2 fodder demons with pu nch nd rocket theb needs ammo
[2:33:37] <uncle_christian> XD
[2:33:38] <%Asuterisuku> Can't BFG, he needs the challenge.
[2:33:39] <%DesertPenguin> YOU HAVE TO HUNT HIM
[2:33:44] <RichochetForce> @DelgotHansto Oh, agreed. He could flash off ONE hit and the other two rockets would drop him
[2:33:49] <somekindaspy> @Asuterisuku it won't kill the archvile instantly.
[2:33:52] <+Yamchadassist> problem is the archvile keeps spawining bullshit
[2:33:53] <umbrellaswereawesome> Naw, they saving that Marauder-Archie combo for Plutonia Eternal.
[2:34:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[2:34:03] <somekindaspy> oh fuck
[2:34:06] <somekindaspy> that would be awful omg
[2:34:06] <peachy996> Ignore buff demons
[2:34:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> Those shields have to go
[2:34:10] <megamonmon123> bfg
[2:34:14] <rytisone> Hunt Down The Archville
[2:34:17] <%DesertPenguin> get i
[2:34:19] <%DesertPenguin> so close
[2:34:19] <+TheBigTaco> Archvile woolie
[2:34:19] <somekindaspy> HES GLORY KILL
[2:34:21] <%DesertPenguin> he was
[2:34:24] <%HostilePoundcakes> so close
[2:34:24] <somekindaspy> oh fuck that was so close
[2:34:24] <%DesertPenguin> took too long
[2:34:24] <DelgotHansto> Killing isnt doing anything to clear out the room while hes about
[2:34:25] <CoffeeSlice> aaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAA
[2:34:28] <resloxxx> NotLikeThis
[2:34:29] <%Josef_Stryker> Dafuq
[2:34:29] <RichochetForce> Archvile flames
[2:34:29] <%Asuterisuku> That was it too!
[2:34:31] <+slimmixrp> It ran out
[2:34:31] <uncle_christian> They <3 Archie
[2:34:33] <somekindaspy> that damn carcass
[2:34:33] <+slimmixrp> Bummer
[2:34:34] <%Asuterisuku> Wrong side though.
[2:34:34] <%the_vedo_show> Reppuken'd
[2:34:36] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus So change the runs so the glory state lasts longer and you can do it from further away
[2:34:39] <%DesertPenguin> runes*
[2:34:39] <RichochetForce> Carcasses put the shield up
[2:34:40] <+RyanTheRecluse> you got him to go
[2:34:40] <%Asuterisuku> Carcass saved his ass.
[2:34:43] <%gamewarden92> wooliePOYO
[2:34:44] <Kei_Ar_> bfg the mooks when theyre on a diffrent floor than archy
[2:34:48] <Taarin> Woolie, they gave you BFG ammo for a good reason my dude
[2:34:49] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus change the runes out!
[2:34:49] <RichochetForce> Carcasses will save glory kill demons
[2:34:50] <resloxxx> @WoolieVersus Rune for longer staggers?
[2:34:51] <DelgotHansto> Honestly just ignore it your OCD be damned you dont need it
[2:34:53] <@Solidus_113> CarcASS
[2:34:53] <%DesertPenguin> Carcasses really prove their worth
[2:34:54] <%Double_Tap_That> Use the rune that increases stagger time
[2:34:58] <%Javaa01> If only there'd be a rune that somehow extends glory kill vulnerability
[2:35:02] <RichochetForce> Carcasses - Amazing support class
[2:35:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> whoever made the carcass ai made them fucking fortune tellers i swear
[2:35:08] <Xxstevo69xX > fuck the rockets, freeze him & mobile turret
[2:35:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THIS IS RAW
[2:35:12] <%seduwu> THIS is RAW
[2:35:13] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Use the runes that increase stagger time and glory kill range
[2:35:14] <%shry7> tHIS IS RAW
[2:35:17] <megamonmon123> put on the longer stagger rune
[2:35:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> just wreck em with the unmakyr 😈😈
[2:35:26] <megamonmon123> if thats an issue
[2:35:30] <RichochetForce> @cobalt_phoenix_ Oh, Hugo Martin was honest about them. They're there to do exactly that. Ruin rocket, SSG, Glory kill
[2:35:32] <RichochetForce> and mobility
[2:35:36] <megamonmon123> longer stagger will probably help
[2:35:37] <somekindaspy> unmaykr requires aim lol
[2:35:38] <%LordSDB> !motivated
[2:35:39] <@Moobot> 1249 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:35:41] <%DesertPenguin> Saving Throw instead of mobility
[2:35:52] <somekindaspy> longer stagger rune, saving throw, and further distance glory kill runes!
[2:35:57] <+anthonywilde1994> that was a sick punch
[2:36:00] <%Asuterisuku> Could've blown up the shield and saved the Blood Punch.
[2:36:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RichochetForce big props to whoever coded them
[2:36:06] <%seduwu> He’s in
[2:36:12] <%Asuterisuku> ... I'm used to the Marauder spawning BEFORE the archie, but it seems reversed here?

[2:38:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shield was my perfect marauder counter
[2:38:15] <Make_me_mad> I think Woolie forgot the chainsaw exists.
[2:38:16] <+slimmixrp> you have like zero ammo

[2:38:28] <+Mecha_G> when Maurader is stunlocked, keep switching and firing
[2:38:28] <somekindaspy> Woolie, did you know there was a map back in the day called the Plutonia experiment where it was NOTHING BUT HALLWAYS OF ARCHVILES
[2:38:29] <%DesertPenguin> Fuck the Sentinel Batteries dude
[2:38:30] <+dabootymagnet> those two BFG shots were meant to distract him!
[2:38:31] <$razielhex> He has 19 shots. He's fine
[2:38:32] <megamonmon123> GG
[2:38:40] <megamonmon123> you dont need sentinel batteries anymore
[2:38:41] <peachy996> You can clean that up later
[2:38:43] <somekindaspy> no
[2:38:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> np
[2:38:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[2:38:45] <%Asuterisuku> There is NOT another Archvile.
[2:38:45] <megamonmon123> dont worry about the challenge
[2:38:46] <RichochetForce> Archvile is one and done.
[2:38:46] <%SuperKirby24> the sounds of a man that has been freshly probed Kappa
[2:38:48] <BlackermanZX> nope
[2:38:48] <RogueMinja> There is not.
[2:38:48] <Xxstevo69xX > last archvile
[2:38:48] <resloxxx> Kappa
[2:38:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's one of each
[2:38:50] <RichochetForce> Don't worry about it
[2:38:55] <somekindaspy> that was the only archie until later on
[2:38:56] <%shry7> guess you gotta restart
[2:38:56] <+RyanTheRecluse> unfortunately you heard chat wrong
[2:38:57] <$razielhex> Nekrovol challenges leave 0 room for error.
[2:38:57] <MasterTonberry23> @somekindaspy Eh that map wasnt that hard since they mostly come one at a time
[2:39:01] <Xxstevo69xX > only one archvile & one tyrant
[2:39:03] <somekindaspy> true
[2:39:04] <@Solidus_113> it was hard panic
[2:39:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie had to learn the ssg/ballista combo thus he pushed the memory of the chainsaw out of his mind
[2:39:07] <peachy996> Something to do at the end of yor LP
[2:39:10] <megamonmon123> dont worry about it
[2:39:10] <Tha_Mik> That looks fun

[2:40:21] <RichochetForce> It's part of Harassment
[2:40:21] <Hydrapissed> its vergil she made a deal with him
[2:40:25] <%DesertPenguin> Another scrabble word lol
[2:40:39] <somekindaspy> To be fair, Sam is actually not a fan of this alliance.

[2:41:55] <RichochetForce> She made both, though.
[2:41:59] <%gamewarden92> 5G that gives eternal life
[2:42:07] <somekindaspy> The Divinity Machine super boosted Doom Guy's soul and made him a demi-god

[2:42:31] <%Asuterisuku> Full Auto is actually usable with that.
[2:42:52] <%Javaa01> It's cool, but worthless compared to sticky bombs
[2:42:58] <+anthonywilde1994> full auto is fun with slow mo rune
[2:43:00] <%gamewarden92> 19 shots should be enough for the rest of the level
[2:43:03] <%Asuterisuku> Look at THIS room.

[2:43:23] <%NotSafeForPBS> @WoolieVersus I guess this game was almost finished when research came out that multi-tasking is now considered to be...pseudo-science at best? Also I'm still confused with the lore...So it's implied that Samuel is the priest who gave doomguy the covert power-up AND the betrayer? And what had he to gain from helping Earth? Was he just trying to claim it as his own argenta turf and muscle out the Maykers?
[2:43:24] <RichochetForce> Sick

[2:43:51] <BlackermanZX> sam is not the betrayer at all

[2:44:16] <peachy996> The boy
[2:44:17] <somekindaspy> just gotta climb
[2:44:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @notsafeforpbs betrayer is someone else
[2:44:19] <%R3Roundabout> betrayer and sam are different entities

[2:44:37] <%NotSafeForPBS> @cobalt_phoenix_ ah ok thanks
[2:44:39] <Xxstevo69xX > green means go
[2:44:39] <%Asuterisuku> The green is climbable, the spikes are not.
[2:44:40] <somekindaspy> pretty sure sam is actually the wretch tbh
[2:44:42] <RichochetForce> Wait, what does Marc Ecko have to do with health?
[2:44:46] <%Javaa01> Climb green, don't facefuck the spikes
[2:44:48] <rytisone> tag a graffiti on your way up
[2:44:50] <+RyanTheRecluse> green is good
[2:44:51] <somekindaspy> That lore was told from the demon's perspective
[2:44:53] <RichochetForce> Does he siphon the souls of humans to heal?
[2:44:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yes
[2:44:57] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:44:58] <Maids4lyfe> yes

[2:45:06] <@Solidus_113> this is the challenge
[2:45:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @notsafeforpbs It seems like Sam had a longterm scheme to tear down a corrupt system amongst the Maykrs.
[2:45:13] <%Javaa01> If you didn't then how would you even climb this?
[2:45:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @notsafeforpbs ye, but I am still lost as to how we went from guy who gave doomguy powers to guy that peepeepoopood for the good of humanity
[2:45:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:45:27] <%NotSafeForPBS> me too
[2:45:32] <uncle_christian> oww
[2:45:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Now this is platforming
[2:45:37] <%the_vedo_show> LUL
[2:45:40] <RichochetForce> @cobalt_phoenix_ We're finding that out as we go.
[2:45:45] <umbrellaswereawesome> Honestly, I kind of think that the Serephim is semi-possessing Robo-Sam.
[2:45:49] <Xxstevo69xX > the fire won't kills, just hurts a bit
[2:45:55] <uncle_christian> Prince of Persia
[2:46:01] <%Asuterisuku> Extra Life behind you.
[2:46:12] <somekindaspy> @cobalt_phoenix_ ok so what he did was after he gave doomguy his powers, he escaped through the gate in sentinel prime to the lost city of hebeth. he crawled out onto mars and technologically implanted himself into samuel hayden.
[2:46:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> well i hope it's explained better the second time bc i missed that on my playthrough
[2:46:17] <DelgotHansto> There'll be a room full of walking ammuntion
[2:46:27] <uncle_christian> bla bla bla Sam
[2:46:31] <somekindaspy> no
[2:46:33] <somekindaspy> listen to him
[2:46:34] <RichochetForce> 100% Soul Extraction Efficiency
[2:46:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @somekindaspy oh shit where is that found?
[2:46:37] <+santafer> Heaven and hell!
[2:46:39] <umbrellaswereawesome> Basically, Sam used some alien tech to make his body, and it's only been now that the Serephim part of the personality is becoming dominant. Just a guess, though.
[2:46:40] <RichochetForce> I love this line
[2:46:41] <%the_vedo_show> moon2H
[2:46:46] <%dekkitout> The sickest collab

[2:47:10] <RogueMinja> The soul well.
[2:47:10] <RichochetForce> That final part

[2:47:35] <%seduwu> LIL
[2:47:37] <somekindaspy> @cobalt_phoenix_ just trying to connect the two games. but if you recall during the construction of the argent tower samuel hayden quite suddenly contracted inoperable stage 4 brain cancer and then "out of nowhere" gave out designs to give himself a robot body
[2:47:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> based
[2:47:46] <Dova573> Sam is a firm believer of Light side later
[2:47:48] <%Asuterisuku> There's going to be more suit upgrades in the DLC I bet.
[2:47:57] <+Superbro64> @uncle_christian fyi, the less offensive term is "inuit"
[2:48:01] <RichochetForce> @Asuterisuku I bet we're going to get new weapons, suit upgrades and runes
[2:48:04] <rytisone> he awaited you in the soul chamberrr
[2:48:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> The middle man
[2:48:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah it’s weird that you get more tokens than you need
[2:48:12] <RichochetForce> How the SAM KNOW THIS SHIT!?
[2:48:15] <Hydrapissed> ahhhhh
[2:48:17] <%Javaa01> Hell and Heaven had an NAP
[2:48:17] <ElkRiverDog> Ya know, at least the Khan Maykr is honest about her addiction, SAM!!!!!
[2:48:21] <alexandrecau> They just didn't now where hteir slaves went
[2:48:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Hmmmmmmm
[2:48:30] <RichochetForce> How on EARTH does Sam know all of this shit?
[2:48:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @richochetforce Because he is Samur the Seraphim
[2:48:40] <somekindaspy> @RichochetForce he's an angel, dude
[2:48:40] <MasterTonberry23> @lewdskeletor13 Its not weird, it just means you can get every upgrade without scraping together every single token in the game
[2:48:41] <+anthonywilde1994> wait nd see
[2:48:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> @RichochetForce Kappa
[2:48:46] <+Superbro64> @generalscpatton shhhhhh
[2:48:46] <%NotSafeForPBS> @cobalt_phoenix_ I also take it that where I asked is not what Woolie reads at the beginning & end of the streams?
[2:48:49] <RichochetForce> @GeneralSCPatton Kappa
[2:48:54] <+Superbro64> no spoilera
[2:48:58] <dinnydanny777> "Hey Satan can you get us some free energy with no strings attached" Satan : Mwahahahahahahahaa yes sure
[2:49:01] <tonfirean> It is so weird to me that Doom has lore for people to pause and discuss
[2:49:01] <+Superbro64> spoilers begone
[2:49:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> All Makyrs Are Bastards
[2:49:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @notsafeforpbs usually no
[2:49:18] <Taarin> They met behind Dennys
[2:49:19] <alexandrecau> Think she only heard of hell with doomguy
[2:49:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @superbro64 Woolie already knows. He's talked about it already.
[2:49:21] <+Yamchadassist> yo trail mix is soooo good
[2:49:22] <Xxstevo69xX > what a pompous arrogant bitch that Maykr
[2:49:22] <somekindaspy> See, I won't say what exactly, but there's a serious reason why she was doing this.
[2:49:25] <MKII> I think they learned about hell from doomguy based on an earlier cutscene
[2:49:28] <+Superbro64> @tonfirean did you forget the literal lore level?
[2:49:28] <uncle_christian> If they're here
[2:49:29] <RogueMinja> Didn't they say that the Slayer was the one who introduced the concept of hell to them?
[2:49:31] <brachydios777> It wasn’t planned at first but became an happy coencidence
[2:49:32] <dinnydanny777> Does that imply Heaven had no idea what was actually going on at first
[2:49:32] <%Asuterisuku> They only found Hell after the Slayer arrived.
[2:49:36] <RichochetForce> @MKII Correct
[2:49:41] <somekindaspy> She wasn't just conquering just because. There was a DAMN good reason why. You'll find out when you get to Urdak.
[2:49:48] <%NotSafeForPBS> @cobalt_phoenix_ ah so I haven't unlocked that yet
[2:49:49] <umbrellaswereawesome> Apparently according to the collector's edtion lorebook, the demons themselves consider the Maykrs to be total chumps.
[2:49:57] <tonfirean> I've been dropping in and out, so I probably missed it
[2:49:57] <peachy996> I think a deal was made after Khan Maykr was perplexed on why the demons weren't dying off so easily
[2:50:06] <somekindaspy> @umbrellaswereawesome tbf they kinda are.
[2:50:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> "You made this...I made this"
[2:50:14] <raikagelord1> @RougeMinja yes Doom Guy Unwittingly set up the deal
[2:50:20] <dinnydanny777> This is basically like using the life force of prisoners to power the world, except the prison is Hell
[2:50:22] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus you'll find out why in the urdak lore
[2:50:23] <RichochetForce> Woolie's got it
[2:50:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> happy little accident KappaRoss
[2:50:30] <Xxstevo69xX > She has to balls to say that this is tradition, not until Slayer introduced hell to her.
[2:50:33] <%NeroInfinite> Woolie got it.
[2:50:43] <+santafer> We may have ripped and tore a bit too much that one time
[2:50:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:50:44] <raikagelord1> That is correct
[2:50:53] <+anthonywilde1994> its a new traditioon
[2:50:53] <somekindaspy> Don't worry, Samur hates this deal too
[2:50:57] <alexandrecau> parlay?
[2:51:05] <brachydios777> Doom guy accidentally doomed Argenta
[2:51:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[2:51:07] <somekindaspy> They hate it
[2:51:10] <peachy996> Please Sign your name on this dead guy's back
[2:51:10] <%NeroInfinite> Samual hates it too
[2:51:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Kappa
[2:51:12] <somekindaspy> They're forced to follow her
[2:51:12] <%seduwu> Y’all think Samur played doom?
[2:51:18] <Xxstevo69xX > she controls it all
[2:51:20] <RichochetForce> The rest don't have much of a choice
[2:51:23] <%Javaa01> Urdak is a hivemind, they can't oppose the Khan Makyr
[2:51:24] <%gamewarden92> Urdak is mostly drones that can't disobey her.
[2:51:26] <RichochetForce> She's like a Queen Bee
[2:51:30] <brachydios777> You’ll see
[2:51:30] <grimshuck> The khan maykr is Urdak
[2:51:30] <%doomerskeletor13> She’s the head bitch in charge
[2:51:31] <alexandrecau> Sam says he hates it but really it's because it,s not his terms
[2:51:31] <MasterTonberry23> Soulnado
[2:51:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Most of Urdak must obey her
[2:51:35] <%Asuterisuku> You read earlier that the Drones are bound to the Khan's will.
[2:51:36] <RogueMinja> Secret down below.
[2:51:36] <DelgotHansto> Well the drones aren't mindless but kinda have to agree with her
[2:51:37] <Visorak6> soulnado
[2:51:41] <ElectricHoodie> i don't think doomguy's little climb animation will ever not be funny to me
[2:51:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> Noice
[2:51:44] <RichochetForce> @alexandrecau That's always been my impression
[2:51:44] <somekindaspy> @alexandrecau accurate. damn, samur really is basically lucifer
[2:51:48] <raikagelord1> In charge but Queen bee
[2:51:53] <somekindaspy> Actually, the Khan Maykr is basically lucifer
[2:51:53] <%Asuterisuku> Goddamn Archvile.
[2:51:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ElectricHoodie Have you seen what it looks like in third person?
[2:51:59] <peachy996> Oh the drones have to listen to her but not the Seraphim?
[2:52:03] <Taarin> Why did Samuel send Doomguy away at the end of 2016 then???

[2:54:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @xxstevo69xx He was doing Light Later, seemingly as part of a scheme to tear down the corrupt system.

[2:54:34] <coreybom> @taarin I don’t think Sam was aware of just how argent was made. Remember, he hated the demons too, and most likely had a fair amount of times to find out how it’s made. He did wake up doomguy to kill the demons.

[2:56:48] <RichochetForce> @legacy0117 There is a hierarchy. The Hell Knights blatantly enforce it. In 2016 the Barons of Hell entry mentions they are the Royal Guard of the current Dark Lord

[2:58:48] <Taarin> @coreybom I figured that Sam had to have known the demons were coming, because he just took the crucible at the end of the game and unsheathed the sword with the intent to use its power. I figured he had to have known about this deal beforehand, or else he just seems like a shortsighted idiot.

[3:03:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> @DesertPenguin Was wondering how much of the stuff Woolie has been noticing has been fixed
[3:03:24] <%DesertPenguin> Ouch
[3:03:25] <+TheBigTaco> Meaning that it would be glitchier?
[3:03:27] <peachy996> Crashed a lot for me
[3:03:44] <Taarin> @coreybom Yeah, I just don't get how Sam, a presumed seraphim, didn't see this coming. But I guess he couldn't really do much as one person.

[3:13:33] <MasterTonberry23> Enjoy the art, not the artist. Thats why I can still play Borderlands
[3:13:36] <%kyh9> You really should play Warframe

[3:15:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> INFLUENCERS
[3:15:59] <%SuperKirby24> pan-galactic Kappa
[3:16:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> They inspired all religions
[3:16:15] <%doomerskeletor13> All da religions
[3:16:19] <RichochetForce> They are the reason why "Angels" look the way they do.
[3:16:24] <%DesertPenguin> It's literal heaven
[3:16:25] <RichochetForce> in our culture
[3:16:26] <laguerrilha> All religions are inspired on them
[3:16:31] <uncle_christian> Even The Church of the Sub Genius?
[3:16:41] <Calek> I like how this is actually this universe's version of Heaven and not some Hell offshoot
[3:16:43] <THELava_lad> GOD
[3:16:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> Giant Spagghetti Monster tho
[3:16:45] <somekindaspy> The Father.

[3:17:09] <%SuperKirby24> DADDY
[3:17:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> ATTACK AND DETHRONE GOD
[3:17:12] <somekindaspy> The Khan Maykr is just the Arch Angel. The Father is their creator.
[3:17:13] <RichochetForce> Hell has the Dark Lord. Maykrs have... ?
[3:17:16] <Taarin> Now who could the father be I wonder :)
[3:17:29] <pillowwasp> Papa god
[3:17:31] <somekindaspy> The Khan Maykr is just the Arch Angel, the Father is their creator. Their God.
[3:17:36] <uncle_christian> Maykrs have Woopie cusions for throne
[3:17:38] <%gamewarden92> The Father sounds like a very cool and informative guy.
[3:17:40] <+nintega010> can't wait until he reads all the lore of this level. to see his mind blown.
[3:17:41] <DelgotHansto> The father, the makyr and the sentinel spirt
[3:17:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> GODLIKE

[3:17:56] <raikagelord1> Khan Makyr is Micheal.
[3:17:59] <somekindaspy> We are actually IN Heaven
[3:18:00] <uncle_christian> They are flawed
[3:18:02] <alexandrecau> They are masquearade
[3:18:03] <%doomerskeletor13> The Wrestlemania sign

[3:19:00] <%doomerskeletor13> So like the Demiurge of Gnosticism
[3:19:04] <RogueMinja> So she did this all to not get old and die.
[3:19:09] <RichochetForce> They are literally afraid of growing old
[3:19:09] <%Asuterisuku> God is dead?
[3:19:11] <uncle_christian> "Q'
[3:19:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> Getting old, but then you just get to respawn. So it's not even real mortality.
[3:19:20] <RogueMinja> That's the whole reason.
[3:19:22] <Hydrapissed> jesus transfigured
[3:19:27] <RichochetForce> @GeneralSCPatton Exactly

[3:20:57] <uncle_christian> Woolie cannot see chat?
[3:20:57] <+slimmixrp> Seraphim stole father and gave you your powers
[3:20:57] <%KingVantq> everytime someone says stop someone else says it LUL
[3:20:58] <RichochetForce> Is it really Olivia's theme?
[3:21:00] <Taarin> I can't believe we have potential DOOM story spoilers in this video game

[3:21:04] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @valriot
[3:21:05] <peachy996> Woolie better not see chat
[3:21:06] <%dekkitout> Dimensional AT fields
[3:21:09] <+green715> They already figured it out though
[3:21:10] <alexandrecau> I love that basically Urdak is made to be anywhere Hell isn't instead of somewhere precise
[3:21:12] <somekindaspy> So basically. Hell is twisted mutants. Heaven is all powerful aliens.
[3:21:16] <peachy996> Chat will spoil the best parts of this lore
[3:21:21] <+MajiOMNI> it's just an elaborate explanation of why it is opposite of hell
[3:21:26] <%kyh9> Basically Urdak is in a stable position in a chaos-theory world
[3:21:26] <%doomerskeletor13> People are literally just reacting to what they read
[3:21:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Magnificant
[3:21:28] <uncle_christian> Uh mm
[3:21:28] <%Klefth> @kyh9 Oh shit, you're right. This has MASSIVE Xenogears vibes
[3:21:30] <raikagelord1> Heaven is above hell is below
[3:21:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> isn't it
[3:21:32] <resloxxx> MAGNIFICENT
[3:21:33] <%vextalyst> cheer500 Hey Woolie Caught up with the podcast. I know it feels wierd to be lavished with praise but it's hard not to do so. Seeing someone with very similar experiences to me like growing up being told the color of your skin means you have to work twice as hard or that you talk "white" deal with that and any other number of challenges that can come with being black and come out the other side is nothing short of inspiring. So thank you for what you do and who you are.
[3:21:33] <Artoo_The_Me> Emote mode only!
[3:21:35] <RichochetForce> "Magnificent, isn't it?"

[3:23:16] <h0wiewong> The longest con
[3:23:17] <%NotSafeForPBS> More like 'The Prophets' from Deep Space 9 than 'Q?' I'm still embarassed to expose that I know anything about Star Trek
[3:23:18] <Uselesswhitenoise> sick ass fake id

[3:23:36] <Kaji04> either way he's getting a punch to the face
[3:23:41] <+IncredibleMeh> Think about how Sam in 2016 didn't seem to know shit, but he knew lots of shit right after you plugged him into the fortress.
[3:23:41] <Dapper_Cactuar> it's calm but creepy
[3:23:42] <@Solidus_113> DOOM ETERNAL WENT TO SPACE
[3:23:48] <+JustToWatch> I mean it would probably be pretty easy from him to make a human body to inhabit
[3:23:50] <Rada150> doom guy would have impaled the corpses of Lilith, Adam and every angel on a giant spike on Mars as a warning for every other alien race to backk the fuck off
[3:23:54] <%Asuterisuku> This is a remix of Olivia Pierce's theme from 2016.
[3:23:55] <uncle_christian> Sam used Olivia
[3:23:56] <Giothegame> Remember when the ARC guy said his tech was too alien?
[3:23:57] <%kyh9> It's an opium den

[3:25:02] <%doomerskeletor13> The Father is God to the Makyrs Angels
[3:25:02] <%dekkitout> Will Doomguy put Cthulhu into a submission hold
[3:25:04] <laguerrilha> green pad to jump
[3:25:05] <Hydrapissed> or a spear

[3:31:13] <%DesertPenguin> It sounds powerful but does it even out?
[3:31:14] <sohl21> unless you see tons of fodder
[3:31:18] <%DesertPenguin> awful

[3:36:37] <RogueMinja> Time to get good at headshots.
[3:36:37] <somekindaspy> Maykr Drones are basically worker ants. They're 100% biological.
[3:36:45] <Rada150> show Woolie the speed runs of this game where they head shot almost everything
[3:36:55] <somekindaspy> ^
[3:36:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @theycallmenerf His progress for the Precision Bolt Mastery, before he used the token to skip it. 0/75 headshots.
[3:37:08] <%Asuterisuku> Don't forget Flame Belch.
[3:37:08] <+ShinobiAJ> bugged headshot mechanics
[3:37:09] <%doomerskeletor13> I hope we get more Makyr enemies in the DLC
[3:37:11] <peachy996> Urdak can get tough, don't get cornered

[3:40:18] <%dekkitout> Big ol demon-mech
[3:40:19] <TomaShishigami> Where can I buy that Kirby light?
[3:40:21] <DragonArt07> doodShine
[3:40:23] <DelgotHansto> Next stream is the final one boys
[3:40:25] <umbrellaswereawesome> Hell, I think Sigil actually officially refers to him as Baphomet.
[3:40:26] <+RyanTheRecluse> well he used to be a wall
[3:40:26] <somekindaspy> big ole armored demon titan
[3:40:29] <%doomerskeletor13> He had John Romero inside him
[3:40:31] <Tha_Mik> It should look like John romero smh
[3:40:37] <somekindaspy> @umbrellaswereawesome John Romero considers the Icon of Sin Baphomet
[3:40:40] <Monkeyweed21> Khan Makyr says "burn it all down" to the demons on earth but cant handle them hitting her Starbucks
[3:40:43] <+Superbro64> "Welcome Seraphim" Kappa
[3:40:44] <uncle_christian> Yea yea yea
[3:40:46] <%doomerskeletor13> You will definitely finish the game next stream
[3:40:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit imagine if the longer you took in mission to reach the fight the more hp the icon actually had
[3:40:50] <%kyh9> And you get a FULL heal
[3:40:51] <nexus92x> Lore dump: The Icon of Sin is the corrupted form of the Betrayers son.
[3:40:57] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed at Tier 1.
[3:41:01] <%dekkitout> Warframe has a few of those enemy types- and they are annoying af
[3:41:02] <%Klefth> Headshot piñatas
[3:41:06] <+green715> You can use the Super Shotgun too, if you get point blank
[3:41:10] <MegaQuint> 2/75
[3:41:13] <+slimmixrp> @WoolieVersus You dont HAVE to do a headshot they take normal damage too but extar damage from head and instant death from snipes
[3:41:13] <%Javaa01> Using Chrono Strike if you can't do it for real
[3:41:13] <awalr> icon of sin is from Doom II, but there he was just a goat face stuck in a wall
[3:41:15] <+slimmixrp> *extra
[3:41:16] <%doomerskeletor13> 2/75
[3:41:18] <%Javaa01> And just hit those shots raw
[3:41:19] <%kyh9> Its a high-risk high-reward type enemy
[3:41:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Woolie, you just gotta practice headshots :)
[3:41:25] <Monkeyweed21> The Icon of Sin is also John Romero
[3:41:27] <DelgotHansto> That was a good penultimate stream
[3:41:31] <uncle_christian> Never get close to Drone
[3:41:32] <somekindaspy> They wanted the original Icon of Sin to be a real titan-sized demon but were limited by the technology of the time
[3:41:34] <%gamewarden92> I thought the Icon of Sin was John Romero?
[3:41:45] <Visorak6> Its a FULL health refill woolie
[3:41:45] <%doomerskeletor13> The longer the Icon of Sin is on Earth the stronger he becomes
[3:41:49] <somekindaspy> John Romero considers the Icon Baphomet. Go read up on it

[3:41:52] <%Asuterisuku> Hmmmmmm

[3:41:54] <nexus92x> Jon Romero is the son of the Betrayer confimed
[3:41:56] <xbb1024> Woolie will need to get good at headshots before the boss
[3:42:00] <uncle_christian> Woolie jinxed it
[3:42:01] <Monkeyweed21> John Romero is the Icon of Sin @WoolieVersus
[3:42:01] <RichochetForce> @gamewarden92 Sentinel King Ormero was John Romero.
[3:42:02] <Uselesswhitenoise> AND A CAPRA DEMON
[3:42:03] <+arancet> what??? woolies played a video game? WHEN?
[3:42:04] <NicholasOsen_> I can't wait for the DLC
[3:42:07] <%Theycallmenerf> Icon Of Sin was just a wall texture but I'm very happy he's a full on big boy now.
[3:42:09] <%NotSafeForPBS> For the sequel to be any more epic would it have to involve it taking place in Jupiter and have doomguy going from moon to moon to eventually deal with a demon perched on one of the poles, partly submerged?
[3:42:10] <somekindaspy> I feel bad for the drones.
[3:42:14] <MegaQuint> The longer. The Icon of Sin. Is on Earth
[3:42:24] <MegaQuint> The STRONGER. He will become

[3:47:47] <+CptnCampy61> Novia. The subtitles named him
[3:47:51] <uncle_christian> It was,Doom Slayer bent his Knee to King
[3:47:52] <%doomerskeletor13> At the beginning the subtitles say Novik
[3:47:56] <+CptnCampy61> *Novik
[3:47:57] <RogueMinja> It was the king.
[3:47:58] <RichochetForce> King Novik
[3:48:03] <prime_name> I think a Subtitle either at the start or the end confirms it
[3:48:04] <RichochetForce> It was subtitled.
[3:48:06] <somekindaspy> Doom 2016's voice was a younger King Novik. Doom Eternal's voice was King Novik's.
[3:48:13] <%Asuterisuku> It's worth noting, though, that it's a different voice than the one you hear in 2016. We don't know who THAT voice is.

[3:54:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Still getting those talks today.
[3:54:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:54:16] <CoffeeSlice> <3
[3:54:17] <prime_name> I hate how the phrase "all lives matter" got twisted into some dumb troll shit.
[3:54:26] <uncle_christian> Communication helps enlighten
[3:54:29] <Solidnick18> goodnight <3 woolie and reggie stay safe
[3:54:35] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s a way to distract from Black issues
[3:54:41] <%NotSafeForPBS> uca be like "all souls matter"
[3:54:43] <%DesertPenguin> Is "End Police Brutality" a good slogan?
[3:54:46] <%GraceTBM> when you say "save the rainforest" you don't have to clarify to save all the forests. You're talking about the ones in danger NOW
[3:55:04] <%illtima> Woolie vs. Realest hours
[3:55:05] <RichochetForce> @DesertPenguin Too many police bootlickers will have a problem with that
[3:55:09] <SgtGoatMilk> Sadly some people read what they wanna read, their worldview adds an "only" in front of black lives matter and they flip
[3:55:11] <+paladinstarbuster> "Be the Change" is also a good slogan
[3:55:18] <@Solidus_113> That "Be Safe" was the same tone I got growing up. Lived in a bad neighborhood
[3:55:31] <%fangovafang> i hate how ppl now wanna act so confused about black lives matter.we been sayin it for years
[3:55:47] <+Fatone420> Where i live native americans have it way way worse than black people
[3:55:52] <%DesertPenguin> Was anyone taught that when getting pulled over to immediately turn the car off, put your hands and the keys on the dash?
[3:55:54] <Calek> had a friend named Dante Nero?
[3:55:57] <uncle_christian> Dante is a retired Pimp <3
[3:55:59] <%DesertPenguin> I was
[3:56:04] <%doomerskeletor13> There’s nothing wrong with saying Black Lives Matter
[3:56:05] <prime_name> Wow
[3:56:19] <%HostilePoundcakes> dang
[3:56:21] <CoffeeSlice> jfc
[3:56:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Sigh
[3:56:23] <%DesertPenguin> YEA
[3:56:26] <%Asuterisuku> The Urdak theme is still playing.
[3:56:27] <%DesertPenguin> YEA YEA
[3:56:31] <%doomerskeletor13> Awful
[3:56:32] <%DesertPenguin> I got the same shit basically
[3:56:35] <%DesertPenguin> Just sit and wait
[3:56:35] <+Fatone420> they closed the last residential school in canada in the 90's
[3:56:37] <uncle_christian> Everyone check out the Black Phillips show <3
[3:56:38] <%DesertPenguin> show your hands
[3:56:42] <%DesertPenguin> and I'm white for fucks sake
[3:56:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Damn.
[3:56:50] <%illtima> it's fucked up that road cops have guns in North America...
[3:56:58] <+Afterman_> police in america are fucked
[3:56:59] <+Afterman_> its sad
[3:56:59] <BlackermanZX> that shit is disgusting
[3:57:01] <laguerrilha> @Solidus_113 same, lived on a neightborhood were men walked armed and didn't think kindly of bolivian descendants
[3:57:02] <%DesertPenguin> This is bringing a tear to my eye. It's so fucked
[3:57:04] <+dougrh> i was told never to get out of the car but still shit fucked
[3:57:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I don’t feel safe when I see a cop
[3:57:22] <Dova573> Yeah
[3:57:23] <Dova573> Same
[3:57:25] <uncle_christian> I love Dante's Beige Phillips show <3
[3:57:27] <CoffeeSlice> :(
[3:57:27] <$razielhex> Oh shit, I know the login name Woolie shared with Reggie; it was thatr Fascist Frogman on Twitter that got suspended.
[3:57:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "Sir, my license is in my wallet. I'm going to reach for it, so please don't shoot me."
[3:57:42] <%DesertPenguin> @dinnydanny777 EXACTLY
[3:57:44] <uncle_christian> Richard Pryor
[3:57:44] <RichochetForce> Remember, cops are NOT there to protect and serve you. They are not agents of "Justice" in any way, shape or form.
[3:57:45] <$razielhex> I figured it out
[3:57:52] <+Afterman_> @dinnydanny777 most white people who dgaf about police brutality to poc dont care about it with whites either
[3:57:53] <%DesertPenguin> These protests have white people in them too and they're getting gassed just the same
[3:57:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I call it the racial passive, I can instantly spot a cop whenever they show up
[3:57:58] <%NeroInfinite> Cops need to be vetted more often than not to be honest.
[3:58:06] <%NeroInfinite> Mental checks and all that
[3:58:11] <+Afterman_> cops in america only get like..110-ish hours of training
[3:58:19] <%ekodrop> ahhhhh bad timing
[3:58:22] <%DesertPenguin> There was a protest in fucking Idaho that was probably 90% white people for a black man in Minnesota. Increible
[3:58:24] <%kyh9> yes
[3:58:25] <+Afterman_> and only 8 hours of that are with deescalation/mental health issues IIRC.
[3:58:31] <$razielhex> @Afterman_ 8 of those are in conflict de-escalation techniques
[3:58:35] <RichochetForce> @NeroInfinite Agreed. Look at what happened in Albany. Cops knocked over a 80 year old returning their helmet. Only ONE attempted to help him, and the others left him to bleed out.
[3:58:36] <%NeroInfinite> tazed*
[3:58:37] <%Klefth> Yeah, it's removing salt
[3:58:37] <uncle_christian> tears have salt
[3:58:38] <+MagicBeanBurrito> salivation
[3:58:39] <Visorak6> Reggie is correct
[3:58:42] <%DesertPenguin> Buffalo
[3:58:45] <%DesertPenguin> It was Buffalo
[3:58:50] <%doomerskeletor13> I remember that story about a guy who was too smart to be let in to the police. Like they literally wouldn’t let him join cause he scored too high
[3:58:51] <RichochetForce> Yes, Buffalo
[3:59:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Buffalo
[3:59:06] <RichochetForce> Those cops had people CHEER as they left the courthouse. We have a SERIOUS bootlicker problem.
[3:59:12] <%DesertPenguin> Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo
[3:59:16] <scrumbotime> That makes me think, was there a "Real" Sam who got cancer, and when he died he "didn't die" and Sam went and showed up in a robot body?
[3:59:20] <RichochetForce> Cops do bullshit and get praised.
[3:59:34] <%doomerskeletor13> It was like 57 cops that resigned to show solidarity with those two assholes who pushed that guy over
[3:59:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Fucking wild
[3:59:44] <+Afterman_> @lewdskeletor13 i was JUST about to say that!
[3:59:50] <%NeroInfinite> Yeah, smart cops don't make the cut they want people who just follow orders not whothink.
[3:59:53] <$razielhex> @RichochetForce Social conservatism in the US are all nationalists or ultranationalist authoritarians. THe Boomers never knew hardship, and have openly embraced fascism and white nationalism.
[3:59:54] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 And people have the nerve to say nothing is wrong with the police.
[3:59:54] <%DesertPenguin> On the news tonight they said "some" of them were in support
[3:59:54] <+Afterman_> and when those 2 guys came out of the courthouse, they were met with a bunch of losers cheering them on
[3:59:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lewdskeletor13 let them leave we don't need that kind of cop around
[3:59:58] <laguerrilha> Remember the story of the cop that went pushing to hard to report bad cops, they tried to put him on a sanatorium for "making up conspiracies"?
[4:00:03] <@Solidus_113> It's not that "only black lives matter", It's "black lives matter *too*"
[4:00:05] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[4:00:11] <+vaporousTippler> 57 ragequits all at once has to be some kind of record.
[4:00:12] <uncle_christian> Agree
[4:00:12] <somekindaspy> Every cop i have ever met has been a dick. Every single one.
[4:00:20] <%DesertPenguin> @solidus_113 that's good too :)
[4:00:25] <+Afterman_> dont forget the chris dorner shooting
[4:00:25] <Artoo_The_Me> Man that was garbage for those cops to just walk passed him as he was bleeding out his ear
[4:00:29] <%doomerskeletor13> People would still take issue, let’s be honest
[4:00:34] <%Irridium> "but me tho"
[4:00:35] <+paladinstarbuster> Why is the Too invisible tho
[4:00:38] <%DesertPenguin> That whole analogy about the house on fire is silly
[4:00:42] <%DesertPenguin> let's get a better one
[4:00:47] <%kyh9> People don't understand that BLM is the counter-argument, not the opening argument
[4:00:49] <+Afterman_> he was a black cop who got shit on over and over for trying to report bad cops, so he eventually cracked and waged a war on the LAPD until he died
[4:00:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It’s honestly fucked, man. There needs to be drastic change.
[4:00:53] <RichochetForce> @razielhex Exactly. To them enforcement is good, PERIOD. And any questioning of it is wrong.
[4:00:53] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @duskrush
[4:00:54] <Lee_The_Limey> I saw somebody try and say that 75yo man that got pushed over was faking it. people need to wake up and see the reality.
[4:00:54] <SgtGoatMilk> At the same time, there are people adding an invisible only, people read what their background leads them to read out of it
[4:00:55] <%NeroInfinite> I know a few good cops in my town, granted we're amilitary town so the cops are usually pulled from the military first above anyone else.
[4:01:01] <%south_pyne> wooliePOYO
[4:01:07] <Louie_Salmon> Person with broken legs: "Please help me" Person with working legs: "But what about my legs"
[4:01:08] <prime_name> I'm dreading the day I get my license and have to start driving. I get super nervous when it comes to authority.
[4:01:08] <%kyh9> Bacon?
[4:01:16] <xbb1024> Because the original hash tag caught on to quickly
[4:01:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1268068275423981569?s=20
[4:01:17] <somekindaspy> I kinda agree tho
[4:01:17] <uncle_christian> Mayo
[4:01:19] <Kei_Ar_> BLT is a snack tho
[4:01:19] <ralphfromdk> makes sense
[4:01:20] <AnActualHermitCrab> I'm so tired of telling people that not all lives matter, because to many people my (black) life doesn't matter at all. My nerves are raw and I'm just drained.
[4:01:20] <+Afterman_> yes, bacon is a topping
[4:01:21] <%dekkitout> Blt's do need some turkey or something
[4:01:22] <%kyh9> It needs some thick canadian bacon
[4:01:23] <%gamewarden92> it's a light sandwich
[4:01:23] <Tha_Mik> Yeah
[4:01:23] <pi_in_the_sci> Then you need to but more on
[4:01:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> corned beef sounds good rn
[4:01:24] <Louie_Salmon> But what if there's a LOT of bacon?
[4:01:25] <+paladinstarbuster> Good thick bacon
[4:01:26] <@Solidus_113> that's when you get a BELT
[4:01:27] <Kei_Ar_> dont need main meat if its a snack
[4:01:28] <%wrightlight94> Yeah it need moar meet
[4:01:29] <%DesertPenguin> I know a few good ones. A kid that I grew up with's dad was a detective. My friend and his two brothers all became cops
[4:01:30] <%fangovafang> PowerUpR PowerUpR PowerUpR PowerUpR PowerUpR PowerUpR
[4:01:30] <@Solidus_113> you need that EGG
[4:01:32] <%GraceTBM> that's WHY it's called a BLT, to highlight the limited ingredients
[4:01:32] <prime_name> PREACH
[4:01:36] <%NotSafeForPBS> burger lettuice tomato
[4:01:36] <%HostilePoundcakes> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:01:36] <duskrush> Sometimes the issue isn't that they don't know; it's that they don't CARE, and they want to undermine Black Lives Matter with the All Lives Matter purely because they don't want to hear about it anymore because this isn't a daily thing that they deal with.
[4:01:37] <peachy996> ew i'm done

[4:01:43] <RichochetForce> @Lee_The_Limey I don't know how people get to that point. Do they need the National Guards who helped him up to tell them personally?
[4:01:44] <Kei_Ar_> Bacon griddled cheese is ss thier
[4:01:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> dammit now I want a reuben
[4:01:45] <+CptnCampy61> Hell yeah
