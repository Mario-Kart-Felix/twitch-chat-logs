[0:11:25] <FicboyOG> is the gamer cube coming out for get into fighting games?
[0:11:31] <SummonerMagno> Let Reggier try the cube, hell change his mind, everyone does
[0:11:33] <+KineKithZen> Boy that looks like a quality rubber dome keyboard Kappa
[0:11:34] <hymao> no gamer fuel?
[0:11:41] <%Irridium> it's an area of effect attack
[0:11:45] <%jiggy_snipe> aoe shame
[0:11:49] <%Run44forrest> reggie wishes he had a cool cube
[0:11:50] <@akuda_bar> reggie looks really big cool and masculine next to woolie right now
[0:11:57] <%SirGO0SE> Honestly Reggie you look really jealous but its okay
[0:11:58] <SummonerMagno> the gamer cube accepts all, the gamer cube does not judge
[0:11:59] <%RioGascar> How big is the AOE reggie?
[0:11:59] <%Kriss1827> Reggie Try the cube
[0:11:59] <Captain_Aham> now you're getting one reggie
[0:12:00] <%optimasmaximas> reggie is REALLY social-distancing now LUL
[0:12:01] <+Vancoolness> If it wasn't enough to see the fumbling with the steam controller.. new challenges arise
[0:12:02] <derap41> its great Reggie once you're inside the cube you'll understand
[0:12:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Cube Spreading
[0:12:04] <TigerClaws12> Reggie the cube heretic
[0:12:05] <+Caidezes> Reggie''s poor normie heart.
[0:12:06] <%andrei11dr> SELF ESTEEM AT RISK, (even though that's most streams around here)
[0:12:07] <masterfire23> cube ascension
[0:12:08] <Mothman742> Reggie feeling mighty high and mighty for a feet lover Kappa
[0:12:13] <zombie_goasts> Get in the cube, Shinji
[0:12:18] <hymao> social distancing enforcer
[0:12:21] <$Jugg4n4ut> the shame damage stacks the longer you're around the cube
[0:12:22] <+Psycosis> Reggie the chad and Woolie the cube vergin
[0:12:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Kappa500 not sure if people already told you guys, but HL actually had three campaign expansions where you play as new characters. In Opposing Force you play as one of the military guys named Adrian Shepherd. In Blue Shift you play as one of the Barney’s (the canon Barney actually, Barney Calhoun). In Decay you play as two scientist chicks and it’s co-op. Two teams are working on remaking these atm and want to make it compatible with Black Mesa too. Good time to be a HL fan
[0:12:29] <%Run44forrest> Get in the cube, Reggie
[0:12:43] <%lotharrio> Gamer Cube cannot hurt you.
[0:12:43] <%SirGO0SE> It's okay, we can see the love
[0:12:43] <%doomerskeletor13> The cube brownCOZY
[0:12:53] <+Aeoneth> Despise the Pyramid, Fear the Sphere, Embrace the Cube
[0:12:53] <chickenhunter> cube is great for observing proper social distancing procedure
[0:12:54] <StarlitStunner> Get into CUBEs for Honor and for Glory
[0:12:57] <Nano_osecond> stretch xD
[0:12:58] <derap41> It is nice doesn't matter what people say I also like weighted blankets
[0:13:00] <%andrei11dr> Ew
[0:13:04] <%SirGO0SE> Gamer swaddle?
[0:13:11] <+NecDW4> Adult Swaddle sounds like a 4chan board
[0:13:14] <%Run44forrest> thanks for ruining hamocks woolie
[0:13:14] <zombie_goasts> If a delivery truck barrels into Woolie's house, the cube will serve as a crash cell while Reggie dies unprotected.
[0:13:16] <$Jugg4n4ut> the game womb
[0:13:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Weighted blankets rock
[0:13:17] <dukenux> Welcome to The Cube. It's safe here :)

[0:13:39] <Tatrix912> The Cube: boost Woolie's defense, effects lowers Reggies HP by half LUL
[0:13:40] <%optimasmaximas> @RioGascar we must babify it

[0:14:37] <Ledsagar> LUL
[0:14:37] <zombie_goasts> Will apocalyptic fiction go out of style because of this? Will this finally kill that setting?
[0:14:42] <majima666> in totally unrelated news

[0:15:22] <TigerClaws12> H U S T L E
[0:15:30] <masterfire23> the hustle has changed
[0:15:34] <+Rabbitmage> @lewdskeletor13 cuck
[0:15:39] <%Lion_kun> That show was trash
[0:15:43] <+lumporr> government hustles are the most potent of hustles
[0:15:44] <SummonerMagno> USA be like, we know we fuking everyone over, but the Venezuela
[0:15:47] <%RioGascar> it had 1 good moment
[0:15:49] <zombie_goasts> I want to be an N95 mask hustler
[0:15:50] <@akuda_bar> woolie is describing the only worthwhile moment of this entire show
[0:15:54] <3rdRunner> HELLO GORDON
[0:15:55] <derap41> But it can be
[0:15:59] <NeroInfinite> I don't apologize for America.
[0:16:02] <%doomerskeletor13> @rabbitmage LUL
[0:16:05] <+Restartist> I haven't gone out in 3 weeks now
[0:16:05] <%ozzrabbit> Hey Woolie. My Paypal was glitching out yesterday, and I thing my donations got submitted twice.
[0:16:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @3rdRunner iI dont have my passport :(
[0:16:15] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s a good monologue
[0:16:18] <+Rabbitmage> Liberals propaganda
[0:16:21] <Rezroc> Some jewish guy in the US was raided for the supplies he was hoarding and selling to hospitals for drastically higher prices. Then he coughed on the FBI agents that raided him and said he had Covid
[0:16:25] <derap41> Big yekies
[0:16:27] <zombie_goasts> I want to hustle N95 masks and toilet paper
[0:16:30] <%optimasmaximas> @andrei11dr and it can only go up from here because history definitely won't repeat itself like the last 20's :)
[0:16:30] <%Lion_kun> That show had a story arc where Dev Patel hunts bigfoot
[0:16:40] <%optimasmaximas> as an american, america sucks
[0:16:43] <majima666> i only go out to buy some smokes, a bottle of coke and to take my dog for a walk
[0:16:45] <%RioGascar> @rezroc Thats a good way to get shot by FBI agents
[0:16:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lucky I do a lot of woodworking and have super good N95 masks already because sawdust the size of baby powder up your nose sucks ass
[0:16:53] <+theman515> @ozzrabbit contact paypall and tell them what's up. they might be able to pull the duplicate thing
[0:16:55] <%SirGO0SE> same @optimasmaximas
[0:16:58] <derap41> Rosemary butter is a chickens best friend
[0:17:12] <Nano_osecond> Spice Cube
[0:17:19] <%Irridium> always fun living in a place where if you have to go the the hospital it's like 50/50 you just get bankrupted from the bills. Will your insurance cover it? who the fuck knows!
[0:17:23] <derap41> Its all salt
[0:17:25] <%doomerskeletor13> Nice rack breebuPog
[0:17:25] <%optimasmaximas> @SirGO0SE nationalism and xenophobia are awesome, right? :)
[0:17:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have to saw Woolie looks comfortable
[0:17:29] <AlexStAdams> yo I JUST made coconut chicken with cayanne, lemons, and rosemary
[0:17:29] <dukenux> oh no
[0:17:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> i have 2 friends with VR rigs and was gonna play Alyx but not only is there a quarantine but they're also out of town so i cant even be irresponsible and sneak over
[0:17:39] <%optimasmaximas> @SirGO0SE oh, and can't forget racism! :)
[0:17:42] <dukenux> well fuck, there it goes for me
[0:17:42] <%Javaa01> Yeah, the salt is the silent killer
[0:17:48] <%doomerskeletor13> Alyx is seriously good. VRs killer app
[0:17:50] <Damie904> Yea Asian food is uses lots of salt
[0:17:51] <%Prevot> rip arteries
[0:17:56] <%andrei11dr> That's a lot of food though
[0:17:59] <AlexStAdams> funny story: sugar doesn't have a percentage on the nutritional information because of sugar lobbyists
[0:18:01] <derap41> Have you seen how Kimchi is produced its cabbage buried in salt
[0:18:07] <Ghostbody> You really should Reggie
[0:18:08] <+Rewrench> salt is still salt with or without sugar in body
[0:18:11] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @rider_megalon
[0:18:24] <%RioGascar> i can not wait for valve to give us map making tools for alyx
[0:18:25] <restingbones> There is no escape. You want things to taste delicious? Its gotta be unhealthy is some way.
[0:18:27] <gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Salt in general isn't that horrible, unless you are taking in industrial quantities
[0:18:28] <zombie_goasts> Your hearts will be fine, nothing will go wrong. Coronavirus doesn't affect the heart just the lungs.
[0:18:32] <derap41> Like salt is infused inside the Kimchi cabbage
[0:18:38] <+memequisition> that's like, why at restaurants they only serve a little kimchi
[0:18:40] <zombie_goasts> Oh wait it does affect the heart
[0:18:42] <majima666> say what you want about sugar....but give me a proper soft drink/soda over sugar free versions
[0:18:47] <masterfire23> @lewdskeletor13 it is but i am waitingfor all the stuff people will make with source 2
[0:18:47] <%doomerskeletor13> @riogascar I think someone already made a custom map iirc
[0:18:48] <Twichty> every thing in moderation
[0:18:52] <+KineKithZen> If you're doing a lot of working out you need to replenish salt
[0:18:53] <gunsrlove> Coronavirus DOES affect the heart
[0:18:53] <AlexStAdams> salt deficiency is a greater predictor to hypertension than too much sodium
[0:18:56] <dukenux> i have kidney problems, so i do have to watch out on sodium
[0:19:02] <majima666> now here in the uk because we have a sugar tax bars will only give you coke zero with your drinks
[0:19:20] <majima666> coke zero with my jack daniels tastes effing awful
[0:19:35] <zombie_goasts> As long as your cardio is fine, you'll be fine
[0:19:39] <%Madbearv> I see Woolie is still a a cube
[0:19:42] <%Prevot> coke zero in general tastes awful
[0:19:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie has evolved into more of a cube
[0:19:52] <dukenux> coke zero is garbage
[0:20:01] <%optimasmaximas> woof
[0:20:04] <dukenux> Baz mii
[0:20:07] <%natebud> Not like Evillak
[0:20:11] <zombie_goasts> Sodas mostly taste the same
[0:20:12] <derap41> Monster is the only Zero sugar soda that tastes good I don't know how they do it
[0:20:13] <%doomerskeletor13> :(
[0:20:21] <%Prevot> baz and shovel knight are "friends"
[0:20:23] <terribleusername> Shovel Knight's plus one
[0:20:40] <Infinit_Phoenix> that sounds sick
[0:20:42] <%doomerskeletor13> How is co-op gonna work
[0:20:48] <%rubbishbinge> never ever u_u
[0:20:49] <NeroInfinite> EVILLACK
[0:20:53] <Davimotion96> Woolie looking great in the cube
[0:21:05] <zombie_goasts> Woolie slowly becomes a cube
[0:21:07] <masterfire23> guacamelee 2 tho
[0:21:13] <AlexStAdams> is woolie doing M+KB for black mesa?
[0:21:17] <NeroInfinite> Woolie and pat bump cubes
[0:21:21] <StarlitStunner> The Skullgirls party never stops!
[0:21:21] <%RioGascar> Become as cubes
[0:21:27] <%Prevot> guacamelee 2 is great
[0:21:39] <derap41> Shepard
[0:21:48] <majima666> i completed blue shift back in the day
[0:21:49] <zombie_goasts> True Barney
[0:21:57] <a_mad_dragon> Opposing Force was great, Blue Shift was meh
[0:22:01] <majima666> not sure if i ever completed vanilla hl1
[0:22:10] <unit24> let's not forget the one bonus level where you play as vortigaunts
[0:22:11] <+tuchpi> Opposing Force is so fucking good
[0:22:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:22:14] <StarlitStunner> Blue Shift is super short
[0:22:20] <%prime_name> Whens Hunt Down the Freeman?
[0:22:22] <%RioGascar> Its very very good to be a half life fan right now
[0:22:25] <%Javaa01> Opposing Force is great
[0:22:30] <%Prevot> where's the shill link at the bottom of the screen
[0:22:32] <%natebud> Blue Shift has better arenas, but it's really short
[0:22:33] <RangerJ95> has woolie accepted the cube?
[0:22:39] <+cinder_chan> back when gearbox wasn't total shit
[0:22:39] <+ledgefiendd> ahhhh now I can witness the cube
[0:22:42] <a_mad_dragon> i'm stll waiting for Full Life Consequences: The Game
[0:22:44] <masterfire23> assume the position
[0:22:46] <+palestinianmario> fuck yeah cube
[0:22:49] <NeroInfinite> Woolie was forced to accept the cube or suffer
[0:22:52] <%RioGascar> Opfor is really kinda only liked a lot due to weapons it added
[0:22:53] <terribleusername> locked into the cube like a highchair
[0:23:02] <AlexStAdams> pat 2: hyperpat
[0:23:04] <StarlitStunner> The Pipe Wrench and Deagle from Opposing Force are deadly
[0:23:05] <bleugh> the cube claims its own
[0:23:08] <+palestinianmario> looking like eggman
[0:23:09] <%Prevot> one keyboard two mice and a controller, woolie is a real GAMER
[0:23:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Lots of people like Adrian Shepherd, he has a pretty sizable fan base
[0:23:16] <%lotharrio> In the future, everything will be cubes.
[0:23:18] <+Aheg0d> WAIT is that the CUBE PogChamp
[0:23:18] <valriot> Reggie has become Woolies carer
[0:23:20] <restingbones> Hi Woolie, hi Reggie :) Hope you guys are doing good today.
[0:23:34] <%cisealnine> The instant I show up the Regginator gets up wearing a disappointed face. What did you do Woolie?
[0:23:40] <%RioGascar> Personally as someone who doesnt like shit tons of weapons the design of oppfor is good but high difficulty spikes
[0:23:54] <AlexStAdams> anyone know if woolie is 100% quarantine like Pat?
[0:23:56] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:23:59] <%Prevot> LUL
[0:24:12] <Visorak6> woolie has reverted his object permanence
[0:24:17] <derap41> Reggie once you try it you will never be able to go back
[0:24:19] <terribleusername> stop throwing your food
[0:24:21] <%doomerskeletor13> Well it can’t be 100% quarantine cause Reggie is there
[0:24:30] <+Aheg0d> Table?? Call it what it is, The CUBE
[0:24:35] <%RioGascar> Nah reggie is just living with woolie now
[0:24:36] <unit24> gamer cube will shrink woolie's legs
[0:24:39] <valriot> Weggie I need my contwowwer BabyRage BabyRage
[0:24:39] <%RioGascar> Same with little V
[0:24:42] <%natebud> It's weird because I used to like Opposing Force better than Blue Shift, but after I went back I think Blue Shift is way better designed even for how short it is.
[0:24:52] <%cisealnine> He is living in the GameCube.
[0:24:52] <derap41> Also Woolie has perfect sitting posture right now
[0:24:53] <restingbones> Look at this PRO GAMER
[0:24:55] <terribleusername> mouse and controller? LUL
[0:24:56] <+cinder_chan> this control method seems so ridiculously impractical
[0:24:59] <Alseid> Woolie˄3
[0:25:08] <AlexStAdams> mouse and keyboard yessssssssssss BUENO
[0:25:08] <%SirGO0SE> we're cubing Kreygasm woolieGASM zoneGasm sipsipGasm
[0:25:10] <+KineKithZen> Crowbar noises are wrong, ruined
[0:25:16] <%natebud> That didn't kill the headcrab!?
[0:25:23] <+chaumiester> Does it work? Yes. Then it's not Stupid
[0:25:24] <AlexStAdams> omg woolie on that ABOMINATION setup
[0:25:24] <%lotharrio> Cube life! Cube life! Cube life! Cube life!
[0:25:26] <derap41> @cinder_chan its the best isn't it
[0:25:26] <bleugh> black mesa became the cube arc
[0:25:26] <gunsrlove> We can now openly see the Franken-setup
[0:25:28] <Ghostbody> We've just given up when it comes to woolies control set up
[0:25:36] <%SirGO0SE> the controller movement setup is legit as fuck
[0:25:37] <StarlitStunner> brucegShades CUBE
[0:25:45] <AlexStAdams> woolie is not full cube - woolie is 50% cube
[0:25:45] <Ghostbody> And that aged horribly mate
[0:25:54] <%SirGO0SE> when i was still playing overwatch i played with more than a few masters players who swore it was better for movement
[0:25:56] <%RioGascar> Im amazed it even reads both inputs
[0:25:59] <a_mad_dragon> taking out the little bitey worms was the best thing they did
[0:26:04] <%andrei11dr> Black Mesa indeed
[0:26:07] <Twichty> pp
[0:26:11] <%doomerskeletor13> Doesn’t R Kelly have a harem or something?
[0:26:12] <+cinder_chan> I just, it just looks so uncomfortable to hold
[0:26:12] <%RioGascar> Usually games go no use controller only or a kb+m
[0:26:12] <TigerClaws12> oof
[0:26:13] <%jiggy_snipe> well it wasn't before technically
[0:26:14] <%cisealnine> Isn't RKelly in prison?
[0:26:14] <derap41> Before that thing
[0:26:25] <derap41> @cisealnine he ded
[0:26:33] <Angry_Ev1L> let's be real here - WASD sucks
[0:26:34] <%natebud> Anyone who's ever brushed a mouse while playing controller knows it works
[0:26:34] <%andrei11dr> He knew
[0:26:36] <+cinder_chan> and what about the face buttons?
[0:26:52] <+cinder_chan> wasd is fine, ESDF though? That's where it's really at
[0:26:55] <Bearheart223> I have never seen a setup more suffed than this
[0:27:01] <%Prevot> how long until Drake becomes the new r kelly
[0:27:01] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i move with esdf
[0:27:05] <%natebud> arrow keys is the real acquired taste
[0:27:06] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[0:27:13] <cosmicdischarge> wow really
[0:27:14] <Ghostbody> @prevot It hasn't happened yet?
[0:27:23] <%SirGO0SE> it opens wqazx for hotkeys lol
[0:27:25] <terribleusername> he can't chase us from his cube
[0:27:27] <gunsrlove> LUL
[0:27:36] <%Javaa01> I definitely would, especially since Woolie is a Blanka player, he deserves no respect
[0:27:37] <%Prevot> @ghostbody not that we know at least
[0:27:37] <cosmicdischarge> time to use the WASD
[0:27:42] <masterfire23> just get a mouse with a joystick LUL
[0:27:43] <%cisealnine> I would agree, if you are only refering to chatacter movement.
[0:27:45] <%RioGascar> They would wasd away
[0:27:47] <+chaumiester> No, I agree with that in some sense. A stick is better for WASD. But mouse is awesome for aiming
[0:27:48] <%natebud> He's right about WASD, but there's other reasons to use a keyboard
[0:27:52] <%RioGascar> or qwap away
[0:27:55] <%doomerskeletor13> I wouldn’t want to fight Woolie
[0:27:58] <%jiggy_snipe> a stick is better for movement, mouse better for aiming
[0:28:05] <+Rabbitmage> digital inputs are more precise than analog
[0:28:08] <TigerClaws12> if was dis so bad then why are PC players slaughtering console Jedi Academy players Kappa
[0:28:12] <terribleusername> steam controller is best of both worlds Kappa
[0:28:12] <%Javaa01> You totally can tho
[0:28:13] <TigerClaws12> *WASD
[0:28:13] <%SirGO0SE> controller has more degrees of movement but keyboard has more hotkeys available
[0:28:17] <%Javaa01> It's the only way forward
[0:28:20] <a_mad_dragon> QUICKSAVE
[0:28:24] <+chaumiester> And... as a PC user, you can use both.... with some magic... probably
[0:28:25] <dechakirk> No, you can totally go in, but quicksave first
[0:28:27] <%SirGO0SE> otoh, if hes using the naga mouse he has plenty of hotkeys available
[0:28:41] <+MrRumdum> very nice
[0:28:58] <%natebud> Still is
[0:29:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> WASD scores a 5/10 on movement, but 9/10 on hotkey availability
[0:29:09] <%doomerskeletor13> I thought for sure you’d die
[0:29:25] <%natebud> A keyboard is all hotkeys
[0:29:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:29:35] <%SirGO0SE> if its a 9/10 on hotkey then whats a 10
[0:29:39] <derap41> Nipple is the ultimate movement controller
[0:29:55] <%natebud> Probably some kind of device that is all keys @SirGO0SE
[0:30:02] <%Javaa01> Nah, that's a medic, medics drop health kits on death
[0:30:06] <%SirGO0SE> dang gotta get one of those
[0:30:20] <%doomerskeletor13> “My ass is heavy”
[0:30:22] <+cinder_chan> 10/10 would be telepathic controls I guess
[0:30:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sirgo0se Using some other keys near the center of the keyboard, like UHJK
[0:30:34] <%natebud> Anyone notice that the medics seem to be way more aggressive than the other enemies?
[0:30:40] <masterfire23> getting into shooting games woolieGLORY
[0:31:00] <derap41> @natebud They've seen what Gordon has left behind and are pissed
[0:31:02] <+TekkieX> Combat Medics, they've played too much Team Fortress.
[0:31:03] <%SirGO0SE> @GeneralSCPatton i use esdf to open keys to the left that arent usually there with wasd
[0:31:06] <%RioGascar> The ultimate controller is now vr
[0:31:18] <derap41> That sounds bad
[0:31:24] <%RioGascar> i gotta stick to my trope at this point
[0:31:27] <+cinder_chan> I'd consistently esdf if it weren't such a bitch to remap every single game
[0:31:35] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Freeman killing solders is the equivalent of nerds killing jocks.
[0:31:35] <%SirGO0SE> it really is cinder
[0:31:52] <%doomerskeletor13> breebuPog
[0:31:54] <Twichty> BeeBee
[0:31:57] <+cinder_chan> and then there's stuff like arma where there's 5 actions per key
[0:31:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sirgo0se That feels like a good setup
[0:32:00] <terribleusername> it would be easier to remap your keyboard
[0:32:01] <unit24> wow I didn't know about that suit energy
[0:32:21] <%natebud> look up
[0:32:25] <jorniev> oh this part
[0:32:26] <derap41> Sounds like a rocket barrage
[0:32:30] <Twichty> Jet2
[0:32:30] <+MrRumdum> i like keyboard when playing source games because of the way these games handle player acceleration
[0:32:33] <%RioGascar> Its alien
[0:32:33] <%SirGO0SE> its pretty excellent. if it feels weird at first change where you keyboard sits so your fingers havent moved from their normal wasd position
[0:32:34] <+xerotwo> OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOOOMED WutFace
[0:32:35] <%natebud> dogfights
[0:32:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> what is there to be afraid of, you have a crowbar
[0:32:41] <trfurkanrey18> 4 u
[0:32:53] <%SirGO0SE> and a cube @CaptainPileDriver
[0:32:54] <derap41> Alien Jocks
[0:32:55] <Sixy611> hows the cube
[0:32:58] <jorniev> are they already shooting bees at woolie?
[0:33:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> the CUBEBAR
[0:33:12] <%Javaa01> The aliens bleed yellow, so yeah, the aliens being in a pool of their own blood usually means that they're dead
[0:33:13] <%natebud> Woolie will have trouble leaving this room
[0:33:20] <%Madbearv> isn't that a usable gun
[0:33:21] <%RioGascar> Oh right this part has some sick ass music
[0:33:24] <%SirGO0SE> i feel safe via proximity to the cube
[0:33:28] <derap41> @Madbearv He already got it
[0:33:32] <%Madbearv> o
[0:33:48] <derap41> Under not over
[0:33:51] <%Javaa01> Climb between the pipes on the left
[0:33:56] <%natebud> but why devs?
[0:33:57] <AlexStAdams> what are thooooooooose
[0:34:00] <%SirGO0SE> so sick
[0:34:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> THEY HAVE AIR SUPPORT!
[0:34:02] <derap41> Woolie you invaded them
[0:34:04] <+xerotwo> doodStare
[0:34:08] <AlexStAdams> welcome to URF
[0:34:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> there you go
[0:34:14] <+xerotwo> WHERES WILLIE
[0:34:15] <Iwashi94> THEY FLY NOW?!?!
[0:34:20] <jorniev> THE 12 HOUR WAR was it called?
[0:34:23] <AlexStAdams> THEY FLY NOW.,
[0:34:23] <+Rabbitmage> stealth bomber dinosaurs
[0:34:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DEY FLY NAO?!
[0:34:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> 7 HOUR WAR
[0:34:29] <%doomerskeletor13> brownS brownS brownS brownS
[0:34:29] <derap41> Do you feel like a hero yet gordon?
[0:34:30] <+tuchpi> i love the xen manta rays
[0:34:31] <%natebud> The seven hour war is much later
[0:34:31] <%andrei11dr> Where's Bob Lazard at
[0:34:32] <+YabbaTroll> this aint even the 12 hour war yet
[0:34:35] <%Haarute> remember that LIGHTNING that striked from the sky last session? yeah
[0:34:37] <+YabbaTroll> or 7 hour rather
[0:34:37] <alrobot2014> 7 hour war is after hl1
[0:34:41] <unit24> where's the music?
[0:34:43] <%RioGascar> This is full on invasion
[0:34:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Hopefully we can last 8 hours..
[0:34:45] <pennykettle_> relative to the expanded lore in Half Life 2 these are still lower tier grunts flying over
[0:34:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> 7 Hour War starts in a few days
[0:34:52] <%Javaa01> These guys are doing it out of salt
[0:34:59] <%RioGascar> Uh
[0:35:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> crowbar these guys
[0:35:02] <JetpackMcQuack> Terrans got their ass kicked
[0:35:04] <%Javaa01> Cause you've killed like a hundred guys by now
[0:35:07] <%RioGascar> shouldnt music be going
[0:35:10] <Visorak6> To be fair you've killed dozens of soldiers they would be right to assume you're just going to blindly murder them on sight
[0:35:11] <%SirGO0SE> aim looking good today j/s
[0:35:11] <unit24> yeah what the hell
[0:35:11] <Talinu> You also killed a bunch of them. They're pissed.
[0:35:13] <dechakirk> They're out for revenge
[0:35:16] <%RioGascar> did he bug it?
[0:35:22] <Twichty> nice dodge
[0:35:30] <+YabbaTroll> i think he skipped the music trigger
[0:35:34] <%natebud> Good thing the tank cant turn
[0:35:47] <%RioGascar> woolie you missing hype music and setpieces i think
[0:35:52] <unit24> this saddens me
[0:35:52] <%RioGascar> somehow
[0:36:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> How did he skip the music trigger?
[0:36:18] <pennykettle_> Alyx doesnt take place during the 7 hour war does it? I want to see a war that takes over a planet in a retail shift
[0:36:26] <%natebud> I think it bugged out because he went over the pipe instead of under it. There's supposed to be an exploding APC
[0:36:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:36:28] <derap41> @GeneralSCPatton think because he went in and out o this zone
[0:36:31] <%Lion_kun> How much game is left?
[0:36:32] <%Javaa01> Him going back and forward through the loading zone might have fucked the trigger
[0:36:33] <+YabbaTroll> @pennykettle_ nah, much after
[0:36:44] <Kraahka> He is almost halfway there
[0:36:50] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You are in the middle of a war that is called the 7 hour war in Half-Life Lore.
[0:36:53] <+RueOrin> @Lion_kun Quite a bit
[0:36:58] <gunsrlove> no spoilers
[0:36:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> why are the humans hunting freeman?
[0:37:03] <+YabbaTroll> this isnt the 7 hour war yet
[0:37:04] <pennykettle_> this isnt the 7 hour war what
[0:37:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've been half paying attetnion for a long time
[0:37:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @razieltano123 The war isn't for a few days I think
[0:37:09] <@akuda_bar> @razieltano123 don't just @ him with stuff that's not correct lol
[0:37:10] <AlexStAdams> 7 hour war confirmed for greatest sci-fi conflict
[0:37:11] <derap41> Misted
[0:37:13] <+Rabbitmage> No spoilers plz
[0:37:14] <%natebud> Not two rockets
[0:37:19] <pennykettle_> is it really only a few days after hl1?
[0:37:25] <%Madbearv> its a 20 year old game imo
[0:37:30] <MayorRev> zap
[0:37:33] <Kraahka> @razieltano123 I'm pretty sure the seven hour war was later when the combine invaded right?
[0:37:39] <%SirGO0SE> make your own meatgag!
[0:37:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> GIBBED
[0:37:42] <jorniev> oh this gun already!?
[0:37:45] <%lotharrio> @CaptainPileDriver It started off as killing all witnesses to what happened in the facility. Now it's because Freeman has killed like... 70 marines.
[0:37:47] <Visorak6> the tau cannon deletes problems
[0:37:48] <unit24> god this part is so less hype without the track aaaaa I'm salty
[0:37:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @lotharrio okay, fair
[0:37:58] <%Haarute> don't worry about that
[0:38:00] <derap41> Only Mouse precision can handel this gun
[0:38:00] <pennykettle_> monkaS
[0:38:04] <%SirGO0SE> um
[0:38:09] <pennykettle_> Ghost Marines
[0:38:09] <%SirGO0SE> NO TIME TO EXPLAIN
[0:38:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> but he did kill those fucks in the claim of self defense
[0:38:10] <+TridentBerryBurst> Its aliens
[0:38:15] <razieltano123> @GeneralSCPatton It's been retconned in HL2 to be this moment.
[0:38:22] <derap41> You were mean to go under the pipe
[0:38:34] <jorniev> delivery for mr abrams!
[0:38:36] <+Rum_Ham1> why is he using a controller even though he's using the cube...
[0:38:45] <+Rabbitmage> because console babies
[0:38:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> @razieltano123 I looked up a timeline. I believe there was a gap of no more than a month
[0:38:46] <derap41> There it is
[0:38:47] <terribleusername> LUL
[0:38:47] <alrobot2014> he doesn't like keyboard
[0:38:49] <%SirGO0SE> hes using a mouse and controller rum

[0:39:05] <%RioGascar> ahahahaha
[0:39:10] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[0:39:10] <%lotharrio> Yeah sure. But if you see a man eating bear, it doesn't really matter if the bear first ate a guy that was hunting it.
[0:39:14] <unit24> crowbar collective, are you seeing this bullshit??
[0:39:16] <MayorRev> SourPls
[0:39:21] <%natebud> Just widen the trigger area for god's sake
[0:39:32] <%emeraldskrull> pipe sounds woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:39:33] <%Javaa01> Yeah, so if you'd have done the right thing, the laser would have killed the tank for you
[0:39:34] <+RueOrin> Wooly is unintentionally the best QA Black Mesa has
[0:39:34] <%RioGascar> I will be fair to both parties on this one
[0:39:35] <gunsrlove> Their fault for putting the music trigger in on SPECIFIC place
[0:39:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> if a man is eating a bear that motherfucker deserves to eat it if he killed it
[0:39:41] <unit24> yeah for real
[0:39:43] <+Rabbitmage> INTENSE LABORATORY ACTION
[0:39:50] <%andrei11dr> I was aware eating curry, wat did y miss?
[0:39:53] <unit24> victory lap music!
[0:39:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> now the music seems to not gonna go away
[0:39:56] <%RioGascar> I missed SO MANY music triggers in death stranding
[0:39:58] <MayorRev> SourPls
[0:39:59] <b_ikki> does it even count without the music
[0:40:01] <%jiggy_snipe> intense searching

[0:40:30] <JetpackMcQuack> Freemans Airpods
[0:40:30] <fangovafang> CROOOWWWBARRR
[0:40:31] <jorniev> COFFE
[0:40:34] <AlexStAdams> can we get any more woolie versus than that?
[0:40:35] <zamzoph> monkaS
[0:40:39] <unit24> they should have hired woolie to QA test this shit
[0:40:44] <Zomner> NotLikeThis
[0:40:47] <%doomerskeletor13> ARESSS
[0:40:48] <%Javaa01> That's a real door
[0:41:01] <%jiggy_snipe> man Woolie really messed up that encounter
[0:41:03] <razieltano123> ZEUUUUSSSS.
[0:41:06] <fangovafang> it is dope
[0:41:08] <derap41> Its good music but its weird how they have timed tracks instead of contextual ones
[0:41:10] <jorniev> THE MUSIC IS SUPER GOOD
[0:41:14] <%RioGascar> I dont think either party is to blame
[0:41:14] <%SirGO0SE> yeah but now we have this great moment
[0:41:17] <%lotharrio> The Cube protected us from that cool fight scene and music.
[0:41:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Just like HL2 LUL
[0:41:32] <%RioGascar> Tho crowbar probably should not have made the trigger so specific
[0:41:33] <jorniev> why even have a cube
[0:41:41] <%RioGascar> and just have it be the whole fence zone
[0:41:46] <%natebud> It's disappointing because most of the best songs are about 40 seconds long.
[0:41:51] <Nano_osecond> look at all those inferior cubes
[0:41:57] <jorniev> lambda complex?
[0:41:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Couchmaster advantage
[0:42:03] <gunsrlove> I guess, Woolie is getting used to it, otherwise why the cube without a keyboard
[0:42:03] <%Genericmistake> The cube has turned Woolie into a real GAMER
[0:42:06] <%lotharrio> The Cube is really good at this game.
[0:42:07] <%andrei11dr> Cartos never really screamed anyone's name in 4 did he
[0:42:13] <restingbones> The gamecube
[0:42:13] <%emeraldskrull> the cube woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[0:42:15] <%Javaa01> The cube is a definite improvement
[0:42:21] <%SirGO0SE> psaBig improvements
[0:42:21] <%andrei11dr> Well, except for BOI!!!
[0:42:25] <Ghostbody> Big number improvement
[0:42:27] <%lotharrio> Woolie's becoming such a Cube Chad.
[0:42:28] <NeroInfinite> Kratos just said BOY a lot
[0:42:30] <worldbrand> LUL
[0:42:33] <pennykettle_> Are we getting to nerd central
[0:42:34] <Captain_Aham> only cube can judge me
[0:42:35] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You are in the halfway point of the game.
[0:42:36] <terribleusername> let not ye judge the cube, let the cube judge you
[0:42:37] <Zomner> The Judge, The Jury, The Cube
[0:42:40] <%Irridium> BIO SLIME
[0:42:44] <%Haarute> not great, not terrible
[0:42:45] <Aydarkzero> not bad but not good either Kappa
[0:42:49] <%Javaa01> Your personal humiliation is totally worth the MASSIVE increase in accuracy
[0:42:52] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The Cube is playing Half-Life pretty well
[0:42:59] <derap41> In Clinical test the Cube has shown to improve performance 800% and not just in gamer related activites
[0:43:29] <+nintega010> is a trigger on his button the jump button
[0:43:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:43:30] <%SirGO0SE> after using the Cube, if you have sustained an erection for more than four hours please consult a medical professional.
[0:43:43] <%natebud> That's the Soviet way
[0:43:47] <derap41> There are only 2000 infected per day. But sir we can only acquire 2000 test kit a day
[0:43:49] <Fiendmaw> Wait,is he using a controller for movement?
[0:43:52] <%RioGascar> Its insane how true that hbo is
[0:43:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> soviet way is the way of "shutup it's fine"
[0:44:08] <%RioGascar> like barely anything in that is fake or dramatiized
[0:44:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Its been 3.6 for decades Pepega
[0:44:32] <nothuzad> Gronk is sophisticated
[0:44:35] <Kraahka> They don't teach object permanence in the military
[0:44:36] <+Balkespower> that is a weird way to play a FPS if I ever saw one
[0:44:37] <nothuzad> *Kronk
[0:44:40] <jorniev> i love in freemands mind were he just completely loses it to the idea of HAVING to run around radioctive crap
[0:44:41] <%Javaa01> Yes, the trap, the trap specifically meant for Freeman
[0:44:43] <%SirGO0SE> haha funny number
[0:45:02] <derap41> @RioGascar The extent of the secondary explosion is and the radiations spreading form heavily radiated people is"
[0:45:03] <NeroInfinite> woolie foregot how to crouch jump

[0:46:21] <korth367> you have to hit them woolie
[0:46:22] <Kraahka> Woolie has auto crouch jump turned on but sometimes it glitches out if he hits his head
[0:46:28] <+gutlesscoward> gamer aim
[0:46:28] <point4effort> Is he left handing a controller?
[0:46:28] <worldbrand> fifty-fifty

[0:46:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes, yes you have woolie

[0:52:49] <NeroInfinite> FeelsBadMan cvHazmat
[0:52:50] <Necnill> Why are sideways elevators so terrifying
[0:52:58] <%RioGascar> they cool
[0:53:06] <oyyzzo> break them all, woolie
[0:53:15] <%natebud> Because they knew they wouldnt be able to get away with an elevator ride that long without some music
[0:53:21] <%RioGascar> Now if I remember og assassins are about to show up
[0:53:28] <+BoomerxDoomer> black table ?
[0:53:31] <%RioGascar> I dont know if black mesa does
[0:53:32] <+Balkespower> Direct hit
[0:53:32] <+Rabbitmage> You now have corona
[0:53:45] <+tuchpi> the assassins? that was way earlier
[0:53:46] <+Balkespower> 6 Bullets
[0:53:52] <oyyzzo> he's been flinging acid his whole life\
[0:53:58] <+Balkespower> More than enough to kill anything that moves
[0:54:00] <stevenellis386> seems like your accuracy is nonsense
[0:54:05] <Nano_osecond> i never used the magnum down sight- i prefered the small dot
[0:54:08] <%Haarute> correct
[0:54:11] <%Javaa01> Yeah, bullsquids go down with one magnum headshot
[0:54:24] <derap41> Crowbars and Crates are Natural enemies like Doors and Crowbars or Nail and crowbars. Or Crowbars and other Crowbars Damned Crowbars they've ruined Black Mesa
[0:54:26] <worldbrand> beware of woomies
[0:54:28] <%natebud> The iron sights are somehow way more inaccurate to me
[0:54:37] <+tuchpi> POWPOWPOW
[0:54:45] <+BoomerxDoomer> some one gave re3 a 60% on their review NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:54:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Magnum is God
[0:54:49] <%RioGascar> I guess theres not round 2 with assassins
[0:54:59] <%DensityD> shotty is friend
[0:55:01] <venomfury86> that Mortal Shell game looks cool
[0:55:11] <+Balkespower> get ready for Ninjas
[0:55:11] <+ThePich> @BoomerxDoomer eurogamer was also not impressed
[0:55:16] <derap41> This Scientist got was probably among the first to die
[0:55:20] <dechakirk> Here we go again
[0:55:21] <+Vorga1339> @BoomerxDoomer if people who aren't picky shits like old fans are giving it bad reviews that doesn't bode well
[0:55:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> NINJAS RETURN
[0:55:26] <VJdarkworld> leggies
[0:55:31] <%andrei11dr> Time to get fucked by assassins
[0:55:33] <razieltano123> @BoomerxDoomer That bastard must die.
[0:55:40] <Fiendmaw> Back in black
[0:55:40] <%Javaa01> BTW they go down with one headshot
[0:55:42] <stevenellis386> GODDAMN NINJAS
[0:55:45] <%Javaa01> from the magnum
[0:55:46] <%DensityD> once you land a single shot, you might get music
[0:55:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> You can never prove the absence of ninjas, only their direct presence.
[0:55:50] <RiverBirch> Fucking Bayonettas
[0:55:51] <NeonBleu> Stiletto pumps in the club
[0:55:52] <derap41> Its long fall boots not Stilettos
[0:55:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> Ninjas understand quantum mechanics a lot more than people realize. That was a controversial part of my dissertation.
[0:56:04] <oyyzzo> the music of ejected cartridges
[0:56:04] <%natebud> woolie no
[0:56:05] <+redyoshi5> wow they are much easier to see in this version
[0:56:10] <+Balkespower> nice one
[0:56:13] <+BoomerxDoomer> re3 is pure 90s , thats what matter the most , when games were good
[0:56:14] <worldbrand> consider bees
[0:56:15] <%DensityD> LUL
[0:56:16] <+Balkespower> shotgun time
[0:56:19] <%Haarute> F
[0:56:25] <Nano_osecond> it could in the original
[0:56:27] <derap41> Behind too
[0:56:28] <GarbageNirvana> @LiquidDinosaur Is that why they're sometimes logs
[0:56:28] <+Rabbitmage> assassinated
[0:56:30] <%DensityD> the cube has failed us
[0:56:34] <stevenellis386> GODDAMN NINJAAASSSS
[0:56:36] <+theKingRamses> do bees beat flips
[0:56:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GarbageNirvana holy shit
[0:56:37] <+ThePich> BEEES
[0:56:38] <%natebud> Time to start throwing down mines.
[0:56:39] <%Haarute> tripmines are good here
[0:56:39] <derap41> First death of the day?
[0:56:41] <Nano_osecond> the guys testing it blow up xD
[0:56:42] <%lotharrio> It's cause Woolie was playing, not the Cube.
[0:56:42] <razieltano123> Shotgun my man.
[0:56:42] <+facenorway> imagine woolie playing this part with a controller
[0:56:50] <Afterman_> wait is woolie playing with a mouse and gamepad?
[0:56:53] <+Balkespower> is playing this on hard?
[0:56:55] <%andrei11dr> Woolie ,you have an explosive on your second fire for the SMT ,u should use it
[0:56:56] <+Balkespower> *woolie
[0:56:59] <+BoomerxDoomer> that aim bot
[0:57:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> I choose to imagine that Gordon Freeman's thesis does involve ninjas somehow
[0:57:07] <%andrei11dr> SMG*
[0:57:08] <+Rabbitmage> Fun fact: the girls are wearing the aperture science boots from Portal
[0:57:13] <dukenux> he does tho
[0:57:15] <oyyzzo> it's fine
[0:57:19] <alrobot2014> @andrei11dr he's got no ammo for the alt fire
[0:57:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> SET TRIP MINES?
[0:57:21] <%natebud> This is what the smg grenades are for
[0:57:23] <stevenellis386> bitches doin flips n shit
[0:57:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> do they have the Long Fall Boots or do they have the leg-braces from game 1?
[0:57:28] <%lotharrio> Throw your little bug buddies at them!
[0:57:30] <worldbrand> oh are those not homing on them?
[0:57:31] <GarbageNirvana> Can't hide from BEES
[0:57:32] <%natebud> The actual answer is explosives
[0:57:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:57:38] <VJdarkworld> the assassins are clearly aimbotting, GTAB PunOko

[0:57:45] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus The bees can't hit them Woolie.
[0:57:45] <+FusRoDom> How small is that hitbox
[0:57:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Like mosquitoes

[0:57:49] <zamzoph> have HAVE to HIT them!
[0:57:51] <Twichty> the spread
[0:57:51] <%DensityD> shotgun is friend
[0:57:52] <+tuchpi> LUL
[0:57:55] <stevenellis386> AHHHH
[0:58:04] <worldbrand> i was hoping the bees would seek better
[0:58:06] <derap41> 2 for one
[0:58:07] <%lotharrio> Hide and go shotgun.
[0:58:11] <+ThePich> the great communicator!
[0:58:17] <%Prevot> GG EZ
[0:58:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Try saying you're sorry to them?

[0:59:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> genuine dicksuckers
[0:59:12] <dukenux> funny enough, assassins might be the one enemy tripwire mines are useful against
[0:59:14] <%Mr_Pylon> theygot portal legs
[0:59:21] <%natebud> That was like 7
[0:59:22] <%andrei11dr> TACTICAL APPROACH

[0:59:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> how come in OpFor the scientists help you? You didnt get the kill order but they'd been hiding from other marines for a day
[0:59:54] <derap41> Appeture are fucking around in Black Mesa
[0:59:56] <Nano_osecond> how do they work- shush!
[0:59:58] <oyyzzo> good touch
[1:00:09] <+RueOrin> Chell has those because they just re-used the assets from a cut enemy in HL2
[1:00:09] <pennykettle_> im currently browsing a timeline of all half life/portal events. what a great world
[1:00:09] <Twichty> BDSM squad
[1:00:11] <Zeemod155> Aperature sells to the highest bidder monkaS
[1:00:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> the military bought the boots from Aperture
[1:00:13] <+tuchpi> @liquiddinosaur i thought it was specified that those ones didn't know
[1:00:15] <dukenux> CBT squad
[1:00:16] <%jiggy_snipe> ninja fetish Kappa
[1:00:16] <+skm742> That must have been added in Black Mesa, right?
[1:00:17] <%prime_name> MGS4 FoxHound
[1:00:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE BLACKEST OPS
[1:00:19] <%natebud> They're the military here to kill the marines. Not even joking.
[1:00:23] <%Javaa01> Aperture is a real company in this world, and they did have DoD contracts all the same as Black Mesa
[1:00:23] <derap41> Latex Squad
[1:00:23] <jorniev> ninjas
[1:00:29] <+theKingRamses> sam fisher trained them in the flippy boots
[1:00:29] <VJdarkworld> BDSM division stole it from Aperture Science WutFace
[1:00:31] <Kraahka> SEND IN THE CBT SQUAD

[1:00:32] <dukenux> Confine Breach Team
[1:00:36] <%SirGO0SE> OPEN UP, time to kiss feet :)
[1:00:38] <%lotharrio> Aperture sold them the boots as long as they promised to kill as many Black Mesa scientists as possible.
[1:00:45] <%DensityD> FeelsBadMan no music in that fight FeelsBadMan
[1:00:46] <+YabbaTroll> mick gordon, bdsm division
[1:00:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tuchpi so no bad marines got to the? just you? I havent played OpFor in years. Likely wont again. But i do like the idea that Black Mesa got invaded by completely different alien armies completely independently from one another
[1:00:55] <Twichty> grey fox
[1:00:55] <restingbones> Can we as a society please start researching sexy bdsm ninjas?
[1:00:57] <%natebud> Man, opposing force is dumb
[1:01:03] <+Buzzkill983> Ghost Reporting
[1:01:04] <JetpackMcQuack> Bdsm is late tech
[1:01:10] <%andrei11dr> So it's MGS4 up in this bitch
[1:01:11] <dukenux> OpFor also added guy ninjas
[1:01:36] <+facenorway> it's the same room
[1:01:37] <%DensityD> this "encounter" room you have already been in
[1:01:37] <derap41> Its where you where
[1:01:38] <razieltano123> The ninja are the Frogs of Half-Life.
[1:01:40] <%DensityD> LUL
[1:01:41] <%natebud> Which are just marines that can take 3 magnum shots @dukenux
[1:01:41] <%RioGascar> Considering portals timeline it now makes it confusing when the resonance cascade occurs. At least in black mesa and not half life
[1:01:46] <UnfilteredComic> encounter been done
[1:01:53] <oyyzzo> haha
[1:01:53] <+EdenOfLove> freemans mind had fun here
[1:01:56] <%Haarute> woolie learns the concept of elevation
[1:02:04] <%DensityD> make a map that loops back into the 2nd floor of the same area, and Woolie's brain melts
[1:02:06] <+tuchpi> @liquiddinosaur i saw a plot summary vid recently and they said the scientists that help you didn't know there was a kill orderr
[1:02:07] <%Madbearv> castlevania confirmed for 4th season
[1:02:07] <fangovafang> LUL LUL LUL
[1:02:13] <%DensityD> he requires hall wuggin
[1:02:18] <Lelfro> was hitting the top of the container
[1:02:26] <derap41> What is Gordons plan at this point
[1:02:33] <Visorak6> Are we finally at the lambda complex
[1:02:37] <%natebud> There's a lot of autoaim on the crowbar
[1:02:38] <%Madbearv> kill as many people as possible
[1:02:40] <%RioGascar> Uh stop the resonance cascade
[1:02:46] <%DensityD> good progress woolie
[1:02:47] <%Javaa01> @derap41 Get to the Lambda lab and figure something out
[1:02:49] <%andrei11dr> @derap41 RIPP AND TEAR
[1:02:52] <%DensityD> and good awareness, keep it up
[1:02:54] <%RioGascar> otherwise more aliens get teleporting in
[1:02:59] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus What is your plan Gordon?
[1:03:09] <+gutlesscoward> hi, ceilings
[1:03:23] <worldbrand> just use stormruler
[1:03:31] <%Madbearv> there's a car, you can just drive away
[1:03:34] <%natebud> It would be cool if you saw those things again wouldn't it?
[1:03:45] <%RioGascar> The whole state is quarantined
[1:03:45] <%Haarute> the big boys have armor, you need to aim at their flesh
[1:03:51] <%RioGascar> freeman is hunted
[1:03:52] <%Mr_Pylon> perfect
[1:03:53] <UnfilteredComic> How has woolies aim been with the gamer cube?
[1:03:54] <beatie_g> that was a good ass throw
[1:03:56] <%DensityD> those "manta ray things" are the horrors of the seven hour war
[1:03:57] <blink289> did woolie get a cube
[1:03:57] <jorniev> BEES
[1:03:58] <derap41> Green energy lightning has nothing against Lead
[1:03:58] <%RioGascar> driving away is a dumb dumb plan

[1:20:14] <%Haarute> you miss shots with rapid fire
[1:20:16] <%DensityD> recoil bloom
[1:20:17] <restingbones> they are further away, less bullets hit them

[1:20:21] <PrideOfFiddles> What is a crosshair? LUL
[1:20:30] <+DreyfussFrost> You were shooting too fast.
[1:20:33] <%Javaa01> Full auto fucks up your accuracy completely
[1:20:42] <%Irridium> that crosshair is kind of hard to see
[1:20:50] <%DensityD> new gun?

[1:20:54] <%natebud> Is this normal?
[1:20:55] <beatie_g> nie low crush
[1:20:58] <Fiendmaw> Did Woolie get invaded by a quake pro just now?
[1:21:00] <beatie_g> nice
[1:21:02] <+DreyfussFrost> The crosshair shows the effect of recoil when it widens.
[1:21:02] <masterfire23> do source engine commands work for black mesa?

[1:24:41] <%SirGO0SE> Megazord
[1:24:45] <Ultimatefool> Woolie looks insane holding his setup like that and I love it
[1:24:47] <%DensityD> gatai
[1:24:52] <%RioGascar> they become cube ^3
[1:25:02] <IAmCaligvla> cube³
[1:25:03] <Zomner> @Sogeki_Dan 3³
[1:25:11] <%natebud> Marines show up, woolie tries to strafe. Vortigaunts show up, he stands completely still. NotLikeThis
[1:25:12] <Zomner> *cube³
[1:25:15] <%Javaa01> Gotta go down stairs to fix the problem before you can hit that switch
[1:25:21] <UnfilteredComic> Emergency Drain Cap Still Active
[1:25:23] <derap41> @Ultimatefool If it works and keeps him happy I don't mind
[1:25:24] <Andu_in> Woolie not reloading his guns gives me anxiety.
[1:26:00] <+ThePich> pull the lever kronk
[1:26:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:06] <%RioGascar> i legit wanan know how lambda team was like
[1:26:17] <%RioGascar> Yeah seal it off and just stop aliens teleporting in
[1:26:20] <%natebud> They made this level very confusing
[1:26:22] <%RioGascar> dont worry about ittttt
[1:26:25] <Ultimatefool> @derap41 Yeah I don't mind if Woolie's satisfied with it, he just looks like he's playing games for the first time
[1:26:37] <%Javaa01> You can after you fix the problem in this room, so get on that
[1:26:37] <%DensityD> pumps and tanks before reactor, but you are doing well, woolie
[1:27:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> i forget do you actually touch the "reactor"? dont you just turn on the water tanks and then go to the stupid spinning portal thing?
[1:27:17] <%RioGascar> You go into the core
[1:27:24] <unit24> so I think now he has to hit the power?
[1:27:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> ENTER CORE
[1:27:31] <%RioGascar> but I imagine touching the reactor would just kill you
[1:27:32] <unit24> I can never remember exactly
[1:27:37] <%natebud> now he has to pull that lever
[1:27:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh that's the thing with the like, spinny thing and the thign that does up and down?
[1:27:45] <StarlitStunner> Galunga
[1:27:48] <derap41> Didn't realize the aliens chant while doing that
[1:27:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> or is that the on that has lasers exploding in it

[1:34:59] <%DensityD> how many different foods does gordon consume in black mesa?
[1:35:05] <%natebud> They used the HL2 zombies which are practically a joke enemy
[1:35:08] <%DensityD> the black mesa game as opposed to original half life?
[1:35:13] <%Javaa01> Yeah, those are all already green and good to go, so no need to fiddle around with them

[1:37:31] <+zylomarkiii> Saving the Gluon gun for the "big" boys.
[1:37:44] <%Javaa01> I wonder when Woolie will figure out that you gotta arc those grenade launcher shots
[1:37:45] <IAmCaligvla> waste all that gluon ammo, woolie
[1:37:46] <%RioGascar> Hes outta ammo
[1:37:51] <%RioGascar> eh
[1:37:52] <Kraahka> Woolie really needs to turn off fast weapon switch
[1:37:58] <IAmCaligvla> it's not like there's a boss coming soon anyways Kappa
[1:38:00] <%DensityD> just teasing, woolie is doing fine
[1:38:01] <%Javaa01> Eh, maybe he'll get around to figuring it out by HL2 Episode 1
[1:38:02] <%RioGascar> the game gives you a lot of ammo later
[1:38:12] <%andrei11dr> Well, we were supposed to get the portal gun in HL3 but then....that happened
[1:38:17] <%jepupu> jepupu subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[1:38:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> does water kill headcrabs here? In half-life 2 it kills them

[1:38:32] <%doomerskeletor13> @andrei11dr When was that confirmed?
[1:38:37] <%natebud> it's the same on all difficulties @a_mad_dragon
[1:38:41] <unit24> can't wait for more youtube uploads, where woolie's health is visible
[1:38:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> also i like how toxic waste in HL2 isnt just green goo and instead its more likely a horrible sickly puke color. makes it scarier
[1:38:52] <%DensityD> real freeman's mind hours
[1:38:55] <%Javaa01> (It wasn't worth it)
[1:39:17] <a_mad_dragon> @natebud the amount you GET is, but not the amount you NEED
[1:39:20] <%andrei11dr> I think it was in the script that got leaked because, it's basically canceled @lewdskeletor13
[1:39:35] <beatie_g> damn, he just stared at you
[1:39:37] <%DensityD> it is indeed an eye
[1:39:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DensityD oh god, if Freeman's Mind's continuity happened in Black Mesa the village scene in Xen would go much differently than in my playthrough...
[1:39:45] <sexdrugsvideogames> black mesaaaaaaa
[1:39:46] <razieltano123> That shotgun is no joke.
[1:39:47] <%natebud> @a_mad_dragon everything still takes pretty much the same damage for some reason even on Hard.
[1:39:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Well no scripts got leaked, the writer released a rough outline, the portal gun wasn’t in it
[1:39:58] <%DensityD> they have additional, smaller eyes that don't glow as much
[1:40:24] <%Javaa01> I think you still need to hit the switch to make the pump go
[1:40:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:40:27] <%Javaa01> Back there
[1:40:31] <%RioGascar> It was apparently talked about by gabe how they wanted to see how a portal gun would work in half life
[1:40:39] <%andrei11dr> Oh ,must've read the wrong synopsis ,then @lewdskeletor13
[1:40:42] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus The original game map was even more confusing.

[1:40:49] <VJdarkworld> @andrei11dr your thinking of epistle 3 . the half life 3 leak was from another disgruntled valve employee and it was only a premise leak
[1:40:49] <%Irridium> LUL
[1:40:50] <beatie_g> SOURCE'D
[1:40:51] <%RioGascar> it was referenced in the ign half life speed run

[1:40:53] <%natebud> it was not more confusing
[1:40:54] <sexdrugsvideogames> @lewdskeletor13 didn't the writer pretty much outlined the entire story?
[1:40:55] <%DensityD> at least no fall damage
[1:41:01] <skattikus> oh man i finally realize why the movement felt so weird on yt
[1:41:27] <%doomerskeletor13> @sexdrugsvideogames No it was just a rough outline, he said it probably would’ve changed had they kept making it

[1:44:40] <%DensityD> I was half expecting a glory kill
[1:44:40] <TigerClaws12> did the guard die?
[1:44:45] <unit24> man this game could really use some death animations along with the ragdolls

[1:46:04] <IAmCaligvla> he died so you could live, woolie :(
[1:46:09] <black_pariah> I'm not great at FPSs but i try not to bumrush enemies while I'm reloading
[1:46:14] <%doomerskeletor13> Not all Barney’s are created equal

[1:46:42] <%Javaa01> This is the correct hole
[1:46:43] <Mako_Kreutzev> monkaS O2

[1:46:48] <+crimsonharvest> are you just swimming in cherenkov radiation?
[1:46:50] <fairore> I've been playing dmc 3 on the switch I can safely say I am now part of the royal guard

[1:46:55] <IAmCaligvla> barney never got freeman that beer though
[1:46:56] <%Javaa01> Absolutely nothing
[1:46:57] <+ThePich> *sonic drowning music*
[1:46:58] <UnfilteredComic> Cant the flow pushes you up
[1:46:58] <%natebud> There's an achievement for drowning in here. I wonder if Woolie will be the first person to get it
[1:47:02] <%Irridium> there;s nothing down there
[1:47:02] <IAmCaligvla> cheap bastard
[1:47:02] <%RioGascar> also i notice how much woolie is effortlessly learning the games design and where to go
[1:47:17] <unit24> this little spot looks new
[1:47:22] <%natebud> Green lights* @RioGascar
[1:47:31] <resloxxx> This is the fun part
[1:47:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:47:32] <dukenux> oh god this part
[1:47:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> It took him till like, Residue Processing to realize that no doorhandle=fake door. He learns slow but sure.
[1:47:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> WELCOME IN REAKTOR
[1:47:37] <%DensityD> are grenades less useful now?
[1:47:38] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus SAVE NOW!

[1:48:07] <%natebud> They're useful, but you just dont get as many. @DensityD
[1:48:08] <Mako_Kreutzev> not good, but not terrible
[1:48:10] <+ThePich> @DensityD really? when?
[1:48:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> you'll get brain cancer but no other cancer
[1:48:21] <%DensityD> ...now
[1:48:24] <Mako_Kreutzev> brain cancer = bigger brain

[1:48:52] <%natebud> This happens in every level if you just watch them and don't kill them.
[1:48:59] <VJdarkworld> the only thing they fear is u BibleThump
[1:48:59] <fetrigon> CUBE
[1:49:01] <dukenux> It was someone's grandpa, Woolie :(

[1:49:23] <%natebud> @LiquidDinosaur No, the pathing is just really bad
[1:49:26] <%DensityD> do you feel like a big damn hero yet?
[1:49:28] <dukenux> Hey, is that graphite?
[1:49:45] <IAmCaligvla> that's a 100% guaranteed brain cancer right there
[1:49:47] <Dave_VD> Holy shit you can style switch in dmc 3 switch?
[1:49:49] <Mako_Kreutzev> dont touch the spicy rocks
[1:49:49] <sexdrugsvideogames> nice heat effects on the lasers
[1:49:57] <%doomerskeletor13> @daviddredd84 Yup!
[1:49:58] <unit24> this is what laser caution meant all along
[1:49:58] <%andrei11dr> Woolie committing alien hate crimes again woolieF woolieU
[1:50:03] <%RioGascar> What a good containment
[1:50:09] <%DensityD> interdimensional portals
[1:50:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Let them Galunga in peace :(
[1:50:10] <Mako_Kreutzev> windbox up-B
[1:50:12] <%RioGascar> Really contained that alien invasion
[1:50:13] <%natebud> no damage from that
[1:50:13] <peachteagaming> woolie long range shotgun fighter
[1:50:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh boy he doesnt know about pushing back until he's fought the alpha houndeyes
[1:50:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @DavidDredd84 It's amazing
[1:50:16] <%DensityD> I should hope there is a pushback
[1:50:31] <%XxPatchworkxX> XxPatchworkxX subscribed at Tier 1.
[1:50:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is a very stable reactor
[1:50:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> Woolie should play Halo 1 where the shotgun actually has something approaching realistic range and is therefore THE FUCKING STRONG
[1:50:44] <gir240> bird shot buck shot bird shot buck shot buckshot buckshot
[1:50:45] <%DensityD> Thank goodness there isn't a shit ton of head bob while crouch walking
[1:50:50] <%XxPatchworkxX> Finally caught one of your streams dude
[1:50:52] <%DensityD> looking at YOU, Bioshock 1
[1:51:01] <%jepupu> Bad aim, but you don't need good aim with shotgun once you're close enough
[1:51:04] <Mako_Kreutzev> Galalung PogChamp
[1:51:05] <peachteagaming> can you turn on V-sync please
[1:51:05] <WotanCR> holy shit the woolie cube wasnt just a meme?
[1:51:07] <%DensityD> or is that an option woolie has turned off?
[1:51:08] <%natebud> Woolie could have crouched through all of lambda complex because vorts cant hit you through guardrails.
[1:51:12] <adimcorner> I begin with you where Yahtzee fell in his one off stream
[1:51:12] <Dave_VD> thats insane. Has anyone tried co-op bloody palace? does it work well?
[1:51:15] <Twichty> u know wha tto do
[1:51:17] <resloxxx> thats a strong one
[1:51:37] <Nested_Dreams> Those are straight up hell energy beams
[1:51:37] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @DavidDredd84 Not online. Local only. Wish I realized that before buying.
[1:51:49] <%Javaa01> It's not that hot, it's just spicy light
[1:51:51] <pennykettle_> Black Mesa uses Argent Energy
[1:51:51] <+ThePich> that definitively how nuclear reactor works
[1:51:55] <dukenux> man
[1:51:55] <Twichty> thats black mesa side project called argent energy :)
[1:51:58] <adimcorner> or maybe it was earlier
[1:52:04] <UnfilteredComic> both!
[1:52:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> Man woolie should also play Bioshock 1 because he likes melee combat. and in Bioshock 1 due to a typo all the wrench buffs stack multiplicatively , so with all of them, even on Hard Mode you will 1 shot EVERYTHING except Big Daddies and maybe bosses.
[1:52:09] <dukenux> elevators in this game equal death traps
[1:52:18] <ramzyrizzles> Interloper does have some strong Doom vibes
[1:52:22] <pennykettle_> I think woolie did play bioshock 1
[1:52:22] <%Javaa01> This is just a supply room, the way forward is the elevator shaft
[1:52:27] <%natebud> big loading for another reason, just ammo/
[1:52:28] <%DensityD> woolieSHOOK woolieWUT
[1:52:32] <black_pariah> like 4 people beat me to the Argent energy joke LuL
[1:52:48] <dukenux> Did Black Mesa steal Argent Energy too
[1:52:49] <Dave_VD> @CanadianAnimatorGuy thats cool I have a buddy to play with. I'm hoping it isn't some whack half co-op like astral chain or old DMC 3
[1:53:00] <%DensityD> I like the atmosphere of bioshock 1
[1:53:02] <%DensityD> haha get it?
[1:53:11] <Mako_Kreutzev> correct SeemsGood
[1:53:20] <VJdarkworld> gogogo

[1:54:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Is there some sort of reward for this or?
[1:54:30] <dukenux> Music makes us feelin' so free
[1:54:35] <+ThePich> stop using explosives at close quarters maybe
[1:54:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:55:09] <sexdrugsvideogames> next time aim for the pp
[1:55:14] <VJdarkworld> saving lives
[1:55:15] <IAmCaligvla> just satchel those suckers
[1:55:25] <%Javaa01> The PP is armored, shooting at it does LESS damage
[1:55:30] <pennykettle_> yeyeye
[1:55:33] <JetpackMcQuack> Its Darwinism
[1:55:34] <Nano_osecond> uses same ammo
[1:55:47] <sexdrugsvideogames> the most important of parts
[1:55:51] <dukenux> I try to save them too tbh
[1:56:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> what a hero
[1:56:01] <%DensityD> get grenades ready?
[1:56:05] <black_pariah> maybe you should turn that off
[1:56:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @legacy0117 i always try to save useless NPCs in this game. if the game doesnt set them up to be a meatgag then ill try my best to help
[1:56:11] <sexdrugsvideogames> better save now woolz...
[1:56:17] <%DensityD> any tactical use of trip mines and satchel charges?
[1:56:18] <%natebud> For some reason the grunt's chest is their weak point now. Makes you wonder why there's no armor there.
[1:56:18] <adimcorner> woolie, your a hero
[1:56:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> Hell when those two guys run to the army and one yells IM THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING i manage to save one of them sometimes
[1:56:24] <%DensityD> everyone forgets they have them
[1:56:30] <gyrobasel> i hated this part in the original game
[1:56:33] <Dave_VD> Wait how does style switching work with quicksilver and dopplegange?
[1:56:48] <UnfilteredComic> HE GOT ONE
[1:56:59] <+Shadow_Yomi> da cube!!
[1:57:03] <Mako_Kreutzev> He did get one though

[1:57:14] <Nano_osecond> he's at a severe disadvantage though- gotta watch out for woolie nades
[1:57:14] <%Javaa01> It's the tutorial room
[1:57:16] <%DensityD> was G-man supposed to be here?
[1:57:20] <peachteagaming> touch it!

[1:57:34] <%Haarute> touch them
[1:57:34] <Mako_Kreutzev> Go in the energy ball
[1:57:36] <%natebud> maze?

[1:57:50] <%DensityD> woolieSHOOK
[1:57:54] <JustMeAndOtherPeople> Get ORB
[1:57:56] <adimcorner> his gun is actually empty, he just holds it for intimidation purposes
[1:57:57] <dukenux> just walk into it 4Head
[1:58:01] <IAmCaligvla> NOT THIS ONE
[1:58:03] <Twichty> morgan freeman :)
[1:58:03] <unit24> I think he missed g-man already
[1:58:04] <Mako_Kreutzev> Kreygasm charged
[1:58:04] <IAmCaligvla> THE OTHER ONE
[1:58:05] <%Haarute> orange one
[1:58:07] <Zomner> oh god this puzzle
[1:58:11] <ramzyrizzles> Now you're playing with portals!
[1:58:16] <pennykettle_> hey look its Portal like 8 years before Portal
[1:58:19] <sexdrugsvideogames> whew
[1:58:24] <IAmCaligvla> LUL
[1:58:26] <dukenux> waow
[1:58:28] <%DensityD> good voice line
[1:58:29] <%Haarute> only one way though
[1:58:30] <Mako_Kreutzev> Portals! PogChamp
[1:58:42] <dukenux> Now
[1:58:43] <sexdrugsvideogames> prototype
[1:58:45] <dukenux> You're thinking
[1:58:48] <JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis
[1:58:50] <dukenux> with Portals
[1:58:51] <Mako_Kreutzev> with teleportals
[1:58:56] <%natebud> you though
[1:58:56] <%Javaa01> Woah, worldbuilding
[1:58:57] <Klefth> Well, at least Aperture's version just causes cancer.
[1:58:59] <IAmCaligvla> big brained woolie
[1:59:00] <%Javaa01> Who'da thunk it
[1:59:12] <pennykettle_> I just read the timeline, I think Aperture's portals were made like 60 years before Black Mesa's
[1:59:13] <%RioGascar> So we stole their “tech”
[1:59:19] <Twichty> aka... u just got introduced to a mechanic u are sure to rely on
[1:59:20] <stanlychicken> But that version requires moonstones
[1:59:24] <+gutlesscoward> and apeture did shower curtains
[1:59:25] <derap41> Apature made a bridge Mesa did multiverse
[1:59:27] <TigerClaws12> other version requires moon surfaces right?
[1:59:32] <%DensityD> I mean yes, they are from a different 'planet' but they are also from an entirely different dimension, so is "alien" the right word?
[1:59:33] <%RioGascar> man Black mesa even stole FROM ALIENS
[1:59:48] <pennykettle_> Apertures portals dont need moondust, the white goo does. you can place it on other materials
[1:59:51] <%DensityD> Interdimensional beings doesn't roll off the tongue very well, thoi[
[1:59:57] <%Javaa01> The way down there is later
[2:00:00] <Mako_Kreutzev> i think this is a dead end
[2:00:11] <IAmCaligvla> nothing more on this room
[2:00:14] <adimcorner> alien means foreign so yeah
[2:00:15] <Klefth> @DensityD Yes. "Alien" doesn't just mean different planet
[2:00:19] <%andrei11dr> Black Mesa are definitely the most committed of the two
[2:00:26] <%natebud> All the portals in the tower lead to tons of ammo, except for two.
[2:00:32] <%RioGascar> However aperture was trying to make portals that are not one way or portal gun based
[2:00:35] <pennykettle_> @andrei11dr committed to ruining the earth
[2:00:39] <%DensityD> thanks, alien is broader than extra-terrestrial
[2:00:40] <%RioGascar> See: the borealis
[2:00:41] <Twichty> here we go
[2:00:44] <awalr> that's some science shit
[2:00:45] <pennykettle_> wew lad
[2:00:46] <%Javaa01> Now for today's episode of Puzzle Bois
[2:00:54] <%Javaa01> Save
[2:00:55] <%jepupu> Somewhere here
[2:00:58] <IAmCaligvla> DONT SAVE HERE
[2:01:00] <%Haarute> this room lmao
[2:01:01] <%DensityD> did someone order a video game?
[2:01:02] <IAmCaligvla> INSTANT DEATH
[2:01:08] <+gutlesscoward> NICE
[2:01:11] <%natebud> just trial and error
[2:01:12] <unit24> he will learn
[2:01:13] <pennykettle_> video games
[2:01:23] <dukenux> save when you're safe tho. they probably changed it, but iirc one in the og HL straight up killed you
[2:01:27] <UnfilteredComic> There is a way to do this OTHER THAN trial and error
[2:01:28] <%RioGascar> This part is kinda poorly explained
[2:01:28] <%DensityD> Headman's charriot
[2:01:31] <+gustavozxd> oh God this part
[2:01:34] <%DensityD> kill the necromancers
[2:01:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> NOW your thinking with portals!

[2:18:22] <%natebud> idk @GeneralSCPatton
[2:19:19] <%natebud> I'm not sure how he'd reach the new OpFor guns on controller, they're all bound to 6 and 7.

[2:21:52] <%RioGascar> If reggie is gonna suffer from motion sickness boy i wonder how half life alyx lp (whenever the hell you do it, doesnt matter when) will fair
[2:22:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Can Reggie wear the jorts like the sexy lady in the ad
[2:22:07] <alrobot2014> glad to know i'm not the only one with motion sickness in source games
[2:22:17] <zamzoph> comfort cube
[2:22:18] <sexdrugsvideogames> have you disabled vsync?
[2:22:21] <Iwashi94> or the comfort cube Kappa
[2:22:22] <%SirGO0SE> the cube is the ultimate comfort cage
[2:22:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> i get motion sick in OG Doom 1+2, and Duke Nukem.
[2:22:26] <SilverWolfX9> "C O M F O R T . C A G E"
[2:22:31] <%Javaa01> Honestly, I would try to maybe crank up the FOV and see if that helps
[2:22:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> it's the fact that in that engine you dont actually move, the map is just sliding around you
[2:22:41] <terribleusername> yes
[2:22:45] <sexdrugsvideogames> yeah FOV
[2:22:46] <UnfilteredComic> never
[2:22:48] <%Javaa01> Because low FOV and unstable framerates are the biggest killers in terms of motion sickness
[2:22:49] <Iwashi94> only game I got motion sicknes from so far was Metroid Prime's gamecube version
[2:22:49] <derap41> guitar hero sickness
[2:22:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> prolly config file, right?
[2:23:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:23:07] <%RioGascar> oh boy reggie might not be able to handle VR
[2:23:19] <derap41> head wobble helps that a lot
[2:23:19] <terribleusername> FOV is absolutely a fix for a lot of people
[2:23:33] <%Javaa01> FOV is changes the perspective
[2:23:35] <%DensityD> poor reggie
[2:23:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> what game
[2:23:36] <unit24> which game?
[2:23:39] <%DensityD> what game was it
[2:23:41] <%SirGO0SE> yikes
[2:23:43] <derap41> Seymore "Pathetic"
[2:23:45] <sexdrugsvideogames> bunnyhop said, you can train for vr aka get used to it
[2:23:48] <UnfilteredComic> Andd you dont even move in that one, was probably space pirate sim
[2:23:53] <%DensityD> what was the movement controls? teleporting?
[2:23:54] <%Javaa01> Oh, Pistol Whip
[2:23:59] <%DensityD> OH SHIT on rails?!?!?
[2:24:02] <%Javaa01> He played Pistol Whip
[2:24:03] <%DensityD> that's horrible in vr
[2:24:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pistol Whip would be a problem
[2:24:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> You have to be in control of your movements. if the game makes your head move and your head isnt moving? PUKE..
[2:24:27] <%RioGascar> reggie i can recommend you some games to get started in vr
[2:24:37] <UnfilteredComic> youhave to build up to VR
[2:24:38] <%jepupu> Scanner Sombre on VR was a wild ride
[2:24:51] <%RioGascar> unity vr games do not feel great
[2:24:57] <UnfilteredComic> the beak
[2:25:00] <%Javaa01> The thing with Pistol Whip for a first timer in VR is that the constant movement fucks with your inner ear, where you're seeing movement, but not feeling it
[2:25:09] <%RioGascar> so far no joke the best feeling vr game is now half life alyx
[2:25:11] <sexdrugsvideogames> isn't alyx unity?
[2:25:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> Like i dont get how Skyrim VR works
[2:25:17] <%RioGascar> Nope
[2:25:20] <%Javaa01> Yeah, the virtual nose helps a bit
[2:25:20] <Twichty> oh man u trying to get through alyx is probably gonna be rough
[2:25:20] <derap41> A stationary cockpit helps a ton
[2:25:21] <%RioGascar> Its source 2
[2:25:32] <Mike_Mc> Its like looking at the horizon when you get sea sickness
[2:25:44] <%natebud> Should Woolie play HL2 before Alyx?
[2:25:45] <%Javaa01> The virtual nose tech was discovered by researchers a little under two years ago
[2:25:47] <goomba334> vignetting helps too
[2:25:50] <%Javaa01> And it does help
[2:26:03] <UnfilteredComic> @natebud 100%, that game spoils HL2: ep 2
[2:26:05] <sexdrugsvideogames> yeah, he wants to play all of hl2 first
[2:26:11] <Zeemod155> @natebud yes
[2:26:15] <%RioGascar> not necessarily. vinny, bruce and tomato were not used to vr
[2:26:24] <sexdrugsvideogames> said it on the 'cast
[2:26:28] <%RioGascar> but alyx got them playing longer and longer sessions
[2:26:34] <derap41> The Cube of VR
[2:26:35] <%RioGascar> i did alyx in 1 sitting
[2:26:58] <%Javaa01> You should take two or so sessions as not a new type to get used to VR BEFORE you try a game with smooth movement
[2:26:58] <sexdrugsvideogames> @RioGascar did you play vr before?
[2:27:00] <%DensityD> trust woolie, he is a doctor
[2:27:01] <%DensityD> Kappa
[2:27:09] <goomba334> i cant do prolonged sessions in VR simply bc i get insanely sweaty
[2:27:17] <%RioGascar> I have i would say gotten adapt at vr
[2:27:17] <goomba334> never got sick
[2:27:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> MY first VR experience was HL2 on an early Oculus. It... wasn't great. Many barfs.
[2:27:44] <%RioGascar> The tech for VR has improved massively
[2:28:03] <%Javaa01> I mean, for me, it doesn't do shit, but yeah, if you can't separate actual movement and what you see mentally, then yeah, you need to find your legs first before trying smooth locomotion
[2:28:05] <sexdrugsvideogames> woolie, did you play the football game on psvr?
[2:28:06] <%RioGascar> refresh rate, ipd, resolution, etc
[2:28:13] <%DensityD> thumper kicks
[2:28:19] <UnfilteredComic> Superhot VR PogChamp
[2:28:24] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[2:28:29] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Half-Life ALyx.
[2:28:45] <%Javaa01> Superhot VR is a good starting point honestly, since there's simulated movement
[2:28:45] <%RioGascar> Some games also try to solve movement in interesting ways
[2:28:51] <derap41> Pat thought he shat himself in Stream so you'e fine
[2:28:56] <CookieDoughFK> Have Reggie play Half-Life Alyx
[2:29:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> Anyone have a Alyx LP to recommend? ineed to watch a playthrough asap before i catch spoilers from osmosis
[2:29:08] <sexdrugsvideogames> what about beat saber? good first vr game?
[2:29:18] <%Irridium> get reggie his own cube
[2:29:23] <%RioGascar> some games literally go swing your arms back and forth to move
[2:29:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> beat saber is good if you arent an idiot with no rhythm like me
[2:29:29] <zamzoph> mitigate the pain PepeHands
[2:29:35] <%Javaa01> Beat Saber can be a good first VR game, but you gotta get used to the depth quickly with that game
[2:29:42] <sexdrugsvideogames> @LiquidDinosaur haha
[2:29:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> or i can do it ok but NOT if any "switches" happen
[2:29:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> like where the notes cross and you gotta cross your arms
[2:30:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[2:30:02] <peachteagaming> woolie will now apply for MIT!
[2:30:03] <alrobot2014> movement in source games makes me super nauseous
[2:30:08] <%RioGascar> I would actually recommend the psvr demo disc games. Or valves own “the lab” which is free
[2:30:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> basically im saying im so bad at guitar hero i cant even pay it if there's just 2 colors
[2:30:20] <%Javaa01> Yeah, I feel like this is a FOV thing with Reggie, you'd need to fiddle around with those settings and disabling motion blur
[2:30:39] <sexdrugsvideogames> @LiquidDinosaur twitch stream or it didnt happen LOL
[2:30:40] <derap41> Maybe is all the flat walls
[2:30:45] <%RioGascar> Source is also a bit janky
[2:30:48] <%RioGascar> it hitchs
[2:30:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> Waltz of the Wizard is fun. you're just a wizard standing at your desk doing magic shit and teleporting to other places
[2:31:03] <%RioGascar> i can confirm i had 0 absolutely 0 hitchs in source 2 half life alyx
[2:31:10] <%SirGO0SE> that used to kill me but i forced myself to get used to it
[2:31:18] <%RioGascar> no random stutters, no sudden stops
[2:31:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> you know what game should have VR? Reciever
[2:31:24] <%Javaa01> Because your brain is filling in details that are already filled in based on what you feel, so it doesn't know what to do and assumes you are poisoned
[2:31:33] <%natebud> @LiquidDinosaur 100% this
[2:31:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> THERE'S GOING TO BE A SEQUEL
[2:31:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> RECIEVER 2
[2:31:43] <%SirGO0SE> when was the last time you tried? phones might have helped us
[2:31:44] <UnfilteredComic> Readin my phone too much in my car fucks with me
[2:31:45] <derap41> Phone for a long time still gets me
[2:31:46] <%natebud> yeyeyeyeye
[2:31:51] <+Freeborg1997> Need that willpower
[2:31:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> Also that reminds me i need to beat Overgrowth
[2:32:04] <%RioGascar> I also get car sick which is odd since i am basically invincible with VR
[2:32:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Reggie only has a +2 Fort Save
[2:32:09] <Twichty> weakness
[2:32:10] <clempstwitch> 90 raiders from clempstwitch have joined!

[2:35:48] <%DensityD> clemps hold T to listen to audiologs
[2:36:13] <sexdrugsvideogames> the light is fine
[2:36:17] <UnfilteredComic> Clemps slides a piece of paper across the table to Woolie, a single word adorns the header. "Onlyfans"
[2:36:19] <xdeathknightx> that is one comfy looking cube
[2:36:28] <%DensityD> woolie nods in response
[2:36:29] <Visorak6> I feel like if you're going to play this game once you should explore as you like
[2:37:05] <Klefth> Woolie³ engaged
[2:37:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:37:08] <UnfilteredComic> ^^ I agree
[2:37:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> go back a room for hints
[2:37:17] <derap41> Bit more that 60%
[2:37:20] <terribleusername> just made it through the tutorial
[2:37:23] <Twichty> like 60 ish
[2:37:24] <pennykettle_> 80%
[2:37:26] <UnfilteredComic> 70% ...?
[2:37:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you're almost done with the Lambda labs
[2:37:30] <dechakirk> Definitely
[2:37:34] <%RioGascar> Eh 75%
[2:37:39] <%natebud> Ah man Xen is like 5 hours now
[2:37:40] <UnfilteredComic> Xen is pretty big
[2:37:41] <%lotharrio> Depends on Xen.
[2:37:42] <%RioGascar> Xens now...long
[2:37:44] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You are 70%
[2:37:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> imagine being the guy who works there
[2:38:01] <pennykettle_> Its hard to take into consideration the length of new xen
[2:38:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> just sitting at your dual monitor setup in front of the giant portal centrifuge
[2:38:05] <sexdrugsvideogames> time to try the keyboard...
[2:38:11] <UnfilteredComic> Botched
[2:38:14] <zamzoph> Shut. Down. EVERYTHING.
[2:38:20] <%natebud> wha happun
[2:38:20] <terribleusername> your lord and savior WASD
[2:38:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh god Xen is fucking long. i havent finished interloper because my PC's clock is having some problems but its long
[2:38:38] <%RioGascar> xen is a bit too long
[2:38:38] <%Javaa01> If only there was a PC input device that doesn't go to sleep
[2:38:43] <goomba334> yeah its like 4 hours
[2:38:49] <derap41> Wooh
[2:38:51] <UnfilteredComic> the ...third? to last chapter is so fucking long
[2:38:52] <%RioGascar> and if woolie wasnt reading chat i would go into it
[2:38:54] <pennykettle_> Clap
[2:39:02] <sexdrugsvideogames> i thought black mesas xen is good now?
[2:39:07] <KaiserMario> Do you think Woolie has enough tech around him?
[2:39:09] <%natebud> Interloper is probably longer than Surface Tension now
[2:39:10] <+Nomicro4u> Woolie looks so happy
[2:39:20] <%Irridium> It is good now. It's the best part of the game now. But it's also really long now.
[2:39:27] <%KnivesEve> oh shit we cube today
[2:39:28] <%RioGascar> Oh xen is “good” but it doesnt fix the issues with xen in og half life
[2:39:35] <+Nomicro4u> Sealed in his Gamer Cube
[2:39:38] <ramzyrizzles> Any ID on that Batman figure on Woolie's shelf?
[2:39:43] <%RioGascar> Mainly interloper
[2:39:47] <%Javaa01> The steam overlay exe needs to close before steam registers that its closed
[2:39:54] <%natebud> Xen is completely different, but it's bloated.
[2:39:59] <+tussletoes> I think new Xen rules, it's just the very last section that I thought was tedious
[2:40:09] <UnfilteredComic> bro pls
[2:40:12] <licketysplit123> it's cool they added some stuff that was cut from the old game though. mainly that one story thing
[2:40:16] <sexdrugsvideogames> is there xen in alyx?
[2:40:24] <defaultname3887> C U B E
[2:40:27] <licketysplit123> xen environments but not xen itself
[2:40:39] <%RioGascar> trailer shows xen infestation so yes
[2:40:44] <pennykettle_> it would be great if black mesa released a few months before alyx and the devs got secret info to add into xen to tease Alyx
[2:40:54] <%DensityD> !motivated
[2:40:55] <@Moobot> 774 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:41:01] <licketysplit123> which was gonna be in HL2, environments of xen bleeding into our world
[2:41:03] <sexdrugsvideogames> would be awesome
[2:41:06] <%DensityD> and now back to puzzle boys
[2:41:21] <%RioGascar> i will be as hush hush i can with alyx
[2:41:21] <+Nomicro4u> His body was not ready
[2:41:29] <zamzoph> Reggie has the thing? monkaS
[2:41:30] <%DensityD> woolie has special eyes

[2:42:07] <@chesterr01> the tech is jump then crouch right?
[2:42:09] <%natebud> Woolie has been ignoring the savescrum from the beginning

[2:42:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie sees with eyes unclouded with hate
[2:42:27] <UnfilteredComic> @chesterr01 This game has an auto crouch jump, so he doesnt need to
[2:42:27] <+EdenOfLove> woolie is missing out on content tho if you dont do 5 and 6 and 7 and 8
[2:42:39] <%Haarute> he doesn't have to
[2:42:40] <%Irridium> SAVE
[2:42:40] <@chesterr01> ahhh @unfilteredcomic

[2:48:36] <+Freeborg1997> Yes
[2:48:39] <pennykettle_> gamer pulsating cylinder
[2:48:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> yes Melchior
[2:48:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> Gamer Tesseract
[2:48:54] <licketysplit123> i'm talking about heavy water rio. i think?? lol
[2:48:59] <Shaotanzhiten> The liquid in reactors usually is water, it's very good at buffering the spread of radiation @RioGascar
[2:49:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> Gamer Octagon
[2:49:19] <derap41> Sounds hot
[2:49:23] <%RioGascar> I was under impression coolant was pure blue
[2:49:30] <+Blackjackal95> Jumprope
[2:49:35] <%Javaa01> Okay now do the other button
[2:49:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> whats heavy water
[2:49:36] <%RioGascar> and for reactors but yeah water can be used
[2:49:37] <+MaddyCaddy> Coolant is green
[2:49:41] <sexdrugsvideogames> heavy water is used for a-bomb\s i think
[2:49:55] <%lotharrio> Oh what's that... double dutch?
[2:50:01] <Shaotanzhiten> The reason the water is blue in nuclear reactors is due to the way the radiation effects light passing through it
[2:50:12] <%DensityD> I like the video game LIMBO
[2:50:13] <ramzyrizzles> Eventually you just start doing cartwheels
[2:50:16] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Shaotanzhiten nice
[2:50:17] <%RioGascar> Interesting
[2:50:22] <licketysplit123> neat
[2:50:31] <licketysplit123> thanks shao
[2:50:35] <ramzyrizzles> I mean with regards to the game Woolie is talking about
[2:50:38] <%RioGascar> So wait is coolant just bullshit
[2:50:40] <Twichty> easy
[2:50:48] <ramzyrizzles> Which we call "Chinese Garter" in our country for some reason
[2:50:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @RioGascar i think other things have fancy coolant
[2:50:52] <pennykettle_> coolant is bioslime
[2:50:53] <%DensityD> meanwhile, gameplay
[2:51:02] <%SirGO0SE> monkaS
[2:51:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> but a nuclear reactor needs LOTS OF COOLING so they just use LOTS AND LOTS of normal water
[2:51:15] <%jetjagger222> anyone see the video of that bear getting hit in the nards by a long piece of elastic
[2:51:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:51:22] <Shaotanzhiten> There is coolant in a reactor, it tends to just be around the center cores, you won't actually see it

[2:52:18] <%jetjagger222> they had it in the philippines too
[2:52:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> its radioactive
[2:52:24] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:52:25] <%RioGascar> well it had radiation going through it
[2:52:26] <%RioGascar> So no

[2:56:37] <%optosi> it's perfectly cromulent
[2:56:38] <%natebud> It just keeps going and going
[2:56:38] <awalr> there's a LOT of science to do
[2:56:40] <%RioGascar> Its built into the mesa
[2:56:41] <pennykettle_> its government funded
[2:56:43] <dukenux> It's like CERN man
[2:56:44] <+MaddyCaddy> It's underground!
[2:56:46] <UnfilteredComic> Aperature is also fucking massive
[2:56:46] <%Javaa01> Nah, your suit is already good
[2:56:47] <Melchior_the_Wise> what about CERN?
[2:56:47] <+theKingRamses> isn't lambda a seperate facility
[2:56:48] <dukenux> it's huge
[2:56:50] <derap41> Woolie this entire facility is a test for a self sufficient colony
[2:56:54] <blaggablag> You literally see it on the intro tho
[2:56:58] <+Rabbitmage> Its Super Science!
[2:56:58] <HelghastTroop> yea in apeture in portal 2 is godamn massive
[2:56:59] <a_mad_dragon> yeah CERN is bullshit huge too

[2:57:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Aperture is worse.
[2:57:18] <pennykettle_> LONG JUMP BABE

[2:58:15] <%Javaa01> Three in any direction
[2:58:15] <pennykettle_> it was ANTIFUN to use in the original game

[2:58:26] <dukenux> do all pips reload automatically?
[2:58:28] <%Haarute> reload guns now
[2:58:33] <%Javaa01> Works in any direction, not just forward
[2:58:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Originally it was a straight forward long jump if you run, crouch, then jump
[2:58:39] <sexdrugsvideogames> this is a first person platformer after all
[2:58:41] <unit24> I feel like he's losing his momentum a bit fast?
[2:58:44] <Twichty> yeah it was way worse in the original
[2:58:48] <pennykettle_> Freeman Hunters inc
[2:58:49] <%RioGascar> this is omnidirectional
[2:58:50] <awalr> no need to sell out humanity, humanity is the one providing the jetpacks
[2:58:51] <UnfilteredComic> Fall damage also reduced
[2:58:54] <Visorak6> Assassins
[2:58:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> @GeneralSCPatton like mario 64?
[2:58:57] <Melchior_the_Wise> you can control momentum really easily with the suit
[2:59:01] <+Rabbitmage> you got that korean backdash
[2:59:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Zeemod155 i mean, this is where they send people on expeditions to a dangerous alien world with hostile wildlife (and hostile intelligent life) of course they have guns here. the HEV squads need guns.
[2:59:06] <JustMeAndOtherPeople> I remember it being way jankier to use in the original.

[3:00:41] <Klefth> @MaddyCaddy That emote is so goddamn perfect
[3:00:41] <%Javaa01> But you can't carry ammo over the max capacity, even if your gun only has 1/30 bullets loaded
[3:00:44] <HelghastTroop> oh yea heres the rumpus rom
[3:00:48] <dukenux> take a look at THIS
[3:00:53] <%Tuna_Can_0> SwiftRage Woolie do thing!
[3:00:54] <%natebud> Take those goggles
[3:00:57] <UnfilteredComic> Yes sir
[3:00:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> looks like glados room
[3:01:08] <pennykettle_> wasnt the jump bigger in the original?
[3:01:10] <%lotharrio> Try to run, try to hide. Break on through, to the other side.
[3:01:12] <dukenux> Actually... yes
[3:01:13] <Visorak6> The game ended here before
[3:01:15] <dukenux> it is the point
[3:01:16] <sexdrugsvideogames> hello from the other si-ide
[3:01:17] <+MaddyCaddy> So is it actually good now or just not bad?
[3:01:20] <UnfilteredComic> @pennykettle_ he has to get in xen, low gravity
[3:01:23] <pennykettle_> This is where the mod ended before. it was so awesome but a tease
[3:01:26] <%Javaa01> Get that Gluon Gun out
[3:01:32] <sexdrugsvideogames> its good but too long
[3:01:35] <zamzoph> hmmmmm
[3:01:37] <pennykettle_> @UnfilteredComic thats what I thought. But I feel like i could jump across this room
[3:01:37] <+Freeborg1997> I think this would be a good time to stop
[3:01:38] <licketysplit123> y'know i've never really hated xen in the original. i mean, it wasn't as good, but it was fine imo
[3:01:40] <%natebud> The instant Xen begins, you'll see the fanmade levels go through the roof.
[3:01:41] <%Tuna_Can_0> surely nothing will go wrong
[3:01:43] <Taranfeeto> get ready!
[3:01:43] <+Blackjackal95> @MaddyCaddy Best part of this game
[3:01:44] <+gutlesscoward> open a portal to the hell dimension
[3:01:44] <pennykettle_> HELL PORTAL
[3:01:45] <Klefth> Cue BFG Division
[3:01:45] <Twichty> yes he did
[3:01:47] <+theKingRamses> yes
[3:01:48] <dukenux> new Xen is a mixed bag - most was improved, but the part that sucked the most is now longer
[3:01:48] <%Irridium> to stop the guy keeping the portal open
[3:01:50] <+Freeborg1997> To kill a single powerful being
[3:01:51] <stanlychicken> Kill big thing
[3:01:52] <+Deano8817> yup
[3:01:54] <Shaotanzhiten> You gotta kill the creature causing it
[3:01:55] <pennykettle_> To stop a giant being that is controlling the portals
[3:01:55] <%Javaa01> Yes, you must kill the thing causing the portal storm
[3:01:56] <blaggablag> I like the simmetry of ominous spinning machines at both ends of the game
[3:01:56] <+gutlesscoward> because giygas is chilling out in hell
[3:01:58] <Nested_Dreams> Kill Big Portal Being
[3:01:58] <+theKingRamses> that was the only thing that scientist said to you
[3:01:59] <UnfilteredComic> There is a being there making all this shit happen @WoolieVersus
[3:02:00] <%Haarute> to kill a "powerful being that is keeping the portals open"
[3:02:00] <Twichty> someones holding the portal open on the other side
[3:02:00] <resloxxx> One boi is making big portals
[3:02:01] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus you have to kill the thing making the bad stuff happen
[3:02:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yes, something powerful is maintaining a giant portal
[3:02:02] <%lotharrio> They found out that the portals are now being opened by someone/thing on the other side.
[3:02:04] <sexdrugsvideogames> there is a being there you have to kill
[3:02:08] <derap41> They are litteralyl just throwing shit at the wall and hoping something sticks
[3:02:08] <%Tuna_Can_0> stop hell, kill devil

[3:02:43] <+Rabbitmage> got that big brain
[3:02:43] <sexdrugsvideogames> bullet hell
[3:02:44] <%RioGascar> they said the world beyond
[3:02:45] <pennykettle_> xen is actually not a planet or a dimension but a narrow dimension between dimensions
[3:02:46] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah they said you have to kill Satan.
[3:02:49] <dukenux> i just realized Controllers are like a Xen version of Cliff Racers

[3:02:57] <+Freeborg1997> @RioGascar "Because once you're in Xen, you'll need it."

[3:05:06] <zamzoph> @gutlesscoward it always spoke
[3:05:07] <%ironohki> Oh we're playing Purple Doom.
[3:05:07] <+cha0tic_klutch> Comes. Another. Not. Man.
[3:05:09] <Visorak6> Welcome to Xen woolie
[3:05:10] <HelghastTroop> heres where the budget was put XD
[3:05:13] <Twichty> oh look equipment
[3:05:14] <+Freeborg1997> Good place to stop?
[3:05:15] <%Javaa01> Welcome to the bit of the game that has nothing to do with the original
[3:05:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:05:16] <%natebud> He always spoke @gutlesscoward
[3:05:19] <pennykettle_> My internet is super bad right now so im in 480p unfortunately. wish I could see this in full beauty
[3:05:21] <Zeemod155> Gnu Xen
[3:05:22] <Shaotanzhiten> So, this is the point that, according to Valve devs, they wanted to make things not necessarily scary...but unsettling
[3:05:23] <+TDotGoat> the dimension of the English
[3:05:26] <%Haarute> the TARDIS auto translates for you :)
[3:05:28] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Welcome to Xen Motherfucker.
[3:05:28] <+gutlesscoward> huh, okay, I must've forgotten that
[3:05:30] <venomfury86> hell looks weird here
[3:05:30] <+EdenOfLove> woolie try normally jumping
[3:05:33] <Andu_in> oh boy this immediately looks 10 times better than the og Xen
[3:05:33] <+MaddyCaddy> There was an expedition team
[3:05:34] <sexdrugsvideogames> 444 viewers - nice
[3:05:36] <UnfilteredComic> Yup
[3:05:36] <EDFscout> you think fucker with heads like that COULDN'T read minds
[3:05:37] <%RioGascar> Well valve ran out of time
[3:05:41] <%doomerskeletor13> More likely than you’d think
[3:05:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton In my last DnD game about 3 months in i deeply regretted making my Great Old One patron just be a generic one with the Stussy logo as a sigil. it should have been an Atropal with the Loss symbol
[3:05:46] <%RioGascar> they had to rush xen
[3:05:46] <+EdenOfLove> woolie try jumping
[3:05:50] <licketysplit123> raising the bar had an excerpt of design doc xen and it was weird and freaky
[3:05:51] <+gutlesscoward> man, I can't believe valve ripped off doom 2016
[3:05:57] <blaggablag> Funny how we've been doing this for like 30 yeras now
[3:05:59] <pennykettle_> Gordon Freeman gets trapped and leads a religious cult
[3:06:03] <UnfilteredComic> SAME PLOT
[3:06:04] <pennykettle_> samuel hayden did nothing wrong
[3:06:06] <+johnny_gogo> yes we know sammy
[3:06:10] <%doomerskeletor13> If only the scientists sounded as cool as Hayden
[3:06:12] <+Blackjackal95> Well, Hell is just another dimension in new-Doom
[3:06:14] <dukenux> So i really like how in this game they really sell that BM been doing this shit for a WHILE

[3:06:40] <%Irridium> @chesterr01 They completely rebuilt Xen from the ground up. EVERYTHING is new
[3:06:40] <venomfury86> well Half Life took a lot from Doom
[3:06:41] <pennykettle_> it cannot be overstated how uggo xen was
[3:06:41] <%DensityD> we did it boys, we finally made a good xen
[3:06:44] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus yeah, this is very different from OG Xen
[3:06:50] <zamzoph> Heavenly staaaaaaaar aboooove

[3:07:04] <blaggablag> TRY JUMPING
[3:07:04] <RunningNGunning> There are some of the same beats as the orginal, but this is about 85%-90% new
[3:07:04] <%Tuna_Can_0> AngelThump
[3:07:05] <%doomerskeletor13> This is basically what Valve wanted to do if they hadn’t ran out of time
[3:07:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> the final boss is tetris
[3:07:12] <%jetjagger222> it used to be super gray
[3:07:12] <Twichty> they rushed this part originally

[3:09:01] <%doomerskeletor13> This isn’t space really, it’s another dimension
[3:09:09] <blaggablag> I like how basically the lambda crew were sticking their science dick DEEP down into this place way before anyone ever knew stuff was going to hell
[3:09:09] <+RueOrin> @zamzoph He was. Then he ascended via mass murder

[3:10:22] <Twichty> it reminds u , that ur not safe
[3:10:25] <%RioGascar> lessons are being taught
[3:10:33] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Xen is 4 to 6 hours long. Xen in the original game was 1 hour.
[3:10:37] <zamzoph> The Barnacles pull you back in
[3:10:38] <RunningNGunning> Everything up this point was more or less developed by 2015, everything from now on has been developed for the last 5 years
[3:10:42] <HelghastTroop> just more reasons to eradicate all barnacles from existence
[3:10:43] <UnfilteredComic> flashlight
[3:10:44] <awalr> you're on their home turf
[3:10:49] <%lotharrio> In their natural environment.
[3:10:55] <dukenux> It's their natural habitat
[3:11:02] <+Rabbitmage> Its the human way
[3:11:02] <%aceleapc> Woolie it was a rope, you use them to help with pits
[3:11:05] <Visorak6> You're the invader
[3:11:06] <pennykettle_> isnt it explained it isnt their nautral habitat
[3:11:10] <licketysplit123> yeah marc laidlaw the lead writer said there is nothing native to xen
[3:11:12] <+Rabbitmage> We here to colonize Xen
[3:11:17] <awalr> just casually murder the local wildlife
[3:11:18] <blaggablag> At least they don't hurt you untill you're being munched on, unlike o t h e r p e o p l e
[3:11:19] <zamzoph> now you're the ayyylien!
[3:11:25] <licketysplit123> this is their retreat from big spoilers
[3:11:29] <UnfilteredComic> Blap Blap
[3:11:29] <%lotharrio> What do they drop when you kill them?
[3:11:34] <%RioGascar> But black mesa is not half life so dont gotta worry about that
[3:11:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @licketysplit123 So everything here colonized from other portals?
[3:11:41] <ionfamous> Xen is more like an interdimensional highway for the aliens
[3:11:43] <%RioGascar> Lore wise at least
[3:11:45] <%doomerskeletor13> You’ll learn more about the aliens in da sequel

[3:12:59] <%lotharrio> tenchiGG
[3:13:08] <%natebud> Also the suicide houndeyes NotLikeThis
[3:13:09] <licketysplit123> would explain how invasive antlions are

[3:14:41] <resloxxx> You will want to die
[3:14:50] <ramzyrizzles> NO
[3:14:52] <%lotharrio> Strange physics.
[3:14:52] <goomba334> maybe its like a big bubble
[3:15:00] <%RioGascar> starvation would occur
[3:15:07] <%RioGascar> or maybe you might land on something
[3:15:09] <%doomerskeletor13> Gravity works different in different dimensions I suppose
[3:15:10] <%Javaa01> If you need to ask, then yeah, it's most likely a death pit
[3:15:12] <venomfury86> gravity has left the chat
[3:15:17] <zamzoph> looks like we're gonna hafta jump!

[3:18:40] <%DensityD> look at woolie trying to use video game cliches LUL
[3:18:52] <%natebud> They probably had the chargers before they went to space.
[3:18:54] <%lotharrio> Not every science team member is Gordon Freeman.
[3:18:55] <%DensityD> there are bigger things in Xen than doggos, woolie

[3:20:31] <%Javaa01> But actually tho

[3:25:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> And the medical readout is flipping its shit at what's happening
[3:25:35] <+Rabbitmage> each one of those suits are a billion dollars. What a waste
[3:25:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> IT'S SUIT IS BLARING OUT WARNING MESSAGES JUST LIKE YOURS. THE SUIT KNOWS THE USER IS *FUCKED UP* BUT STILL ALIVE
[3:25:36] <UnfilteredComic> "U-U-U-USER dedeath imminent"

[3:25:52] <%DensityD> monkaS
[3:25:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> Also it flatlines when it dies
[3:26:00] <%Javaa01> Just use the shotgun, since you have a ridiculous amount of ammo for it
[3:26:12] <awalr> at least HEV zombies get that sweet morphine
[3:26:16] <portalmaster112> could you imagine a headcrab controling a hev suit? that would be bonkers
[3:26:23] <+i_zombee> woolie has himself, transformed into a controller
[3:26:26] <%DensityD> final boss, crowbar only.
[3:26:27] <%lotharrio> Poor suit waifus...

[3:26:49] <+Deano8817> it's all about the game
[3:26:50] <%natebud> makes you wonder how many crowbars Gordon could take
[3:26:57] <pennykettle_> reminds me of the surge where they were corpses piloted by their suit AI
[3:26:59] <venomfury86> EM PLEH
[3:27:03] <%Irridium> remember, they still are alive. and fully conscious
[3:27:05] <blaggablag> I like that combo. Very foreshadowy
[3:27:08] <+Markmeltzer> HEV zombies werent in the original game, so it's a super good addition
[3:27:12] <%lotharrio> Bee gun, Woolie. Bee gun.
[3:27:17] <+YabbaTroll> the hev suits contain about 4000 baby hours worth of morphine
[3:27:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @natebud Gordon has carefully dosed himself to acquire an immunity to crowbars
[3:27:18] <%DensityD> enough to kill anything that moves
[3:27:37] <%DensityD> WE WERE IN HERE
[3:27:41] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus That was the same crystal that you used.
[3:27:41] <%DensityD> at least black mesa
[3:27:48] <+MaddyCaddy> They were studying portal tech to compete with Aperature
[3:27:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @YabbaTroll shit that reference reminds me that now that i dont have a commute i'm super behind on the podcast
[3:28:03] <%RioGascar> hev zombies are probably an adition i would see if i worked at valve and go
[3:28:07] <%Javaa01> Pick up the fan next to the crystal
[3:28:11] <+YabbaTroll> @LiquidDinosaur same here lol
[3:28:12] <%RioGascar> Yeah no these guys can be hired

[3:28:37] <+green715> Call it argent
[3:28:39] <%natebud> get used to plug puzzles

[3:29:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Everything was great until that last crystal sample came in
[3:29:27] <%lotharrio> In the original game, you didn't get that feeling from Xen at all. But there was more of the monsters in tubes early on.
[3:29:31] <black_pariah> that was just a torso, the crab woulda been better off peacing out
[3:29:35] <Shaotanzhiten> Yeah, just jam this alien crystal into this reactor, it's fine
[3:29:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> I like how there's pictures of alien autopsy X-rays in the FOOD COURT of the bio lab. the fry cook in there had to be cleared into knowledge that aliens exist
[3:29:59] <%RioGascar> Black mesa has some QUESTIONABLE ETHICS
[3:30:05] <%RioGascar> extremely questionable ethics

[3:41:11] <sexdrugsvideogames> last clip
[3:41:19] <Shaotanzhiten> Yes, just murder the not-quite-native wildlife
[3:41:24] <portalmaster112> this part reminds me of a ps2 game
[3:41:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> everything on this planet is an immigrant
[3:41:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> "planet." you know what i mean. Cluster of rocks.
[3:42:00] <%natebud> Even chunks of the planet aren't from this planet.
[3:42:25] <%lotharrio> Headcrab, Metroid, Facehugger.
[3:42:25] <%Javaa01> Except this looks way better then Prime ever looked
[3:42:28] <%Javaa01> Even on the Wii
[3:42:28] <portalmaster112> its like a mangled version of the swamp from sly 1 and xen
[3:42:35] <blaggablag> Loosely arranged transdimensional real estate
[3:42:44] <KaiserMario> This preceeded everything tho... Half-Life is the Dark Souls of FPSs
[3:43:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> I would just use bees for almost everything here
[3:43:09] <dukenux> Now you're just on an alien safari
[3:43:18] <%JustYudha> Massacre of the wildlife
[3:43:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> But then I mained the shockroach in OpFor
[3:43:21] <Shaotanzhiten> He KILLED IT
[3:43:24] <sexdrugsvideogames> you monster
[3:43:24] <awalr> it's coming right at us
[3:43:27] <RamenRiderZ> Dont shoot amoeba friend
[3:43:29] <unit24> look at woolie being an awful poacher
[3:43:34] <+ItsRatman> Woolie the Big Game Hunter
[3:43:42] <%Javaa01> The amoebuddies are fine
[3:43:49] <KaiserMario> Why???
[3:43:53] <yuribo26> I was gonna talk about the audio
[3:43:56] <yuribo26> Its super good
[3:44:15] <BionicPulga> Sounds like a Disney ride.
[3:44:17] <portalmaster112> woolie the hunter, done with hunting bloodborne beasts and stuff, hes going after ailens
[3:44:18] <yuribo26> I makes me feel like Gordan Freeman in the jungle
[3:44:30] <%RioGascar> This whole xen thing rework audio and deisgn wise is on par with valve
[3:44:39] <KaiserMario> People are getting some Cabella vibes
[3:44:48] <%RioGascar> tho valves audio mixing alyx...takes it to a whole new level
[3:44:52] <JustMeAndOtherPeople> It sounds like a jungle but not an alien jungle
[3:44:53] <%Tuna_Can_0> hunting? or murdering
[3:44:54] <+DreyfussFrost> Man, I never got far in Black Mesa but it's blowing me away how this is all entirely new. Original Xen was just flat platforms covered in shit and floating in a shit nebula.
[3:44:54] <dukenux> do it Far Cry like
[3:45:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Needs more bees
[3:45:04] <portalmaster112> do it like mgs3
[3:45:12] <licketysplit123> i'm not a big fan of this part honestly. it sounds too terrestial
[3:45:50] <%Javaa01> He composed all of the soundtrack for the whole game
[3:45:57] <Andrizzleton> damn xen is completely overhauled
[3:45:59] <%lotharrio> Bees run low but they don't run out.
[3:46:14] <%lotharrio> ...wait, that means there are bees fucking in the bee gun?
[3:46:15] <derap41> No Sapient contact yet

[3:46:41] <pennykettle_> imagine that
[3:46:42] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Who could know?
[3:46:42] <%RioGascar> cause kelly bailey also did both the music and all sounds for half life
[3:46:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> that would be NUTS Kappa
[3:46:51] <Shaotanzhiten> If only, Valve really dropped the ball on that one
[3:46:54] <lymund> Thats crazy talk
[3:47:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @LilacKing no its nuts
[3:47:08] <pennykettle_> i think they planned to add one but they ran out of time

[3:47:36] <%DensityD> PUT YOUR DICK IN IT
[3:47:38] <someyounguy1> probably the end of life of the parasitism is for the corpse to be filled with eggs that consume it
[3:47:39] <portalmaster112> joel neilson did great, but i think kelly bailey kinda outshines him a tiny bit
[3:47:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:47:57] <yuribo26> Damn, Morgan Freeman has some good eyesight
[3:48:03] <Shaotanzhiten> That's a nice transition back into jungle sounds as you come out of the cave
[3:48:07] <sexdrugsvideogames> in you face
[3:48:07] <%lotharrio> Pup-snuffer!
[3:48:10] <derap41> I'm sure nature thanked you for that too

[3:49:00] <awalr> it's just like earth, sometimes an animal wants to eat you sometimes they just want to chill
[3:49:07] <Ciriliko> those creatures were only scared
[3:49:07] <pennykettle_> have hairbraid sex with them
[3:49:12] <derap41> Pretty much all aliens that are on earth went AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

[3:49:38] <%Javaa01> You're going backwards
[3:49:40] <%RioGascar> neither side is good
[3:49:42] <TCDerps> is woolie going backwards?
[3:49:46] <Shaotanzhiten> Yes.

[3:49:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @portalmaster112 I'M WITH THE SCIENCE TEAM!
[3:50:08] <derap41> Yeah that's why Hawking really didn't want Aliens to visit earth
[3:50:09] <%Javaa01> You need to stop going backwards, Woolie
[3:50:09] <KaiserMario> That anime Gate has some good people trying to help the locals
[3:50:09] <pennykettle_> we had dinner with the indians :))
[3:50:25] <licketysplit123> bit meta there. peeperpuppies were originally friendly but playtesters always killed them so valve made them hostile
[3:50:29] <dukenux> LUL
[3:50:49] <%NWannabe> woolie would be that hostile advance team
[3:51:00] <%RioGascar> Yet headcrabs are not friendly
[3:51:02] <%lotharrio> Every tree hugged, is one less hug you get from a person.
[3:51:04] <EDFscout> Happy hippy horseshit hev human headcrab!
[3:51:07] <%RioGascar> they are parasites
[3:51:07] <lymund> Loving the planet= hippie shit
[3:51:11] <+ItsRatman> Woolie dont be a hypocrite, you helped the ithorians
[3:51:12] <+Freeborg1997> You just looped in a circle.
[3:51:16] <dukenux> i mean they kinda are, even in the OG Half-Life
[3:51:23] <%Javaa01> Woolie you need to stop backtracking through half the level
[3:51:24] <%RioGascar> Oh yeah HUG these trees woolie
[3:51:28] <%RioGascar> The ones that stab you
[3:51:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @portalmaster112
[3:51:33] <derap41> @licketysplit123 I mean if you teleported a dog into an aliens planet and a bunch of weird looking things start screaming around it I think I'd bite em
[3:51:38] <asurite_warrior> I mean organisms typically exploit a resource to exhaustion. Nothing other than humans that we know of really makes efforts to conserve or protect an environment.
[3:51:39] <dukenux> this whole thing supposedly started because BM was stealing bunch of crap from Xen in the first place
[3:51:39] <pennykettle_> hee truggin
[3:51:51] <dukenux> and it wasn't a hippy paradise back then
[3:51:58] <%Javaa01> You've been backtracking for five minutes
[3:52:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> @asurite_warrior And even that doesn't work too well, because capitalism
[3:52:24] <%Javaa01> You jumped down into a previous area
[3:52:28] <%Javaa01> Instead of going forward
[3:52:33] <derap41> Hey Woolie You remember that Orange think you put into the laser at the start of the game
[3:52:37] <%DensityD> but who is the sexiest on Xen
[3:52:38] <%DensityD> ?
[3:52:39] <%RioGascar> i have to wonder what...gotta dance around things...the provider of the crystals intenions were when gordon put it in the portal thing
[3:52:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dukenux to be fair Black Mesa scientists didnt acquire the crystal that caused the problem
[3:52:43] <UnfilteredComic> Load the save from the healing pit?
[3:52:47] <+ItsRatman> Woolie you took a shortcut backwards, keep going forward
[3:52:57] <%Javaa01> You need to go back through the cave
[3:53:00] <derap41> @LiquidDinosaur Ogh come on its even the same facility
[3:53:15] <%RioGascar> This reminds of the half lfie 2 ep 2 caves
[3:53:16] <portalmaster112> woolie is progressing backwards, not that id blame him to be fair
[3:53:21] <%RioGascar> And valve simplifying then
[3:53:26] <%lotharrio> Canon is that the G Man gave the sample to the scientists.
[3:53:26] <%RioGascar> Cause playtesters got lost
[3:53:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @derap41 No i mean like, Dr. Breen was presumably handed the crystal by the gman
[3:53:29] <dukenux> @LiquidDinosaur the crystal? no, im aware of G-man's machinations. but BMs actions still put then on the alien radar
[3:53:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> okay yeah sure.
[3:53:44] <%Javaa01> Back up to the leaves that opened up after you shot the red thing
[3:53:46] <Kraahka> Reload your save
[3:53:48] <%Javaa01> That are right behind you
[3:54:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> Fair enough. the whole point of half life is humans are meddling with shit they dont understand and will either come out stronger and better or wont come out.
[3:54:01] <Shaotanzhiten> Just needs to get his bearings again, traveling through a big jungle-environment and reflecting on game design on the same time is hard
[3:54:19] <EDFscout> GO ON
[3:54:22] <yuribo26> monkaS
[3:54:22] <%Javaa01> Across these leaves
[3:54:38] <%RioGascar> And I remember hearing that comment on ep2 and people going “oh valve stop hiring stupid playtesters”
[3:54:43] <%Javaa01> The cave is progress

[3:56:10] <%lotharrio> That's a clip
[3:56:14] <sexdrugsvideogames> hahahahahahaha
[3:56:21] <SheefEatsBeef> physics baby
[3:56:33] <+theKingRamses> source physics
[3:56:42] <%Javaa01> This is a MOMENTUM based engine, angled surfaces will DEFLECT momentum
[3:56:43] <portalmaster112> woolie is learning the ways of the jetpack and source movement
[3:56:52] <faeron93> Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:56:58] <Camail> crouch jump?
[3:57:08] <+GeeWilikers1> omg
[3:57:15] <+GeeWilikers1> source jumping
[3:57:20] <portalmaster112> does woolie know how to crouch jump?
[3:57:21] <TigerClaws12> guess auto crouch jump didn't kick in
[3:57:36] <Shaotanzhiten> Nah, the funky slope instead of an edge makes it a little weird there
[3:57:43] <%lotharrio> Mr Burns
[3:57:59] <%Javaa01> The auto crouch jump stops when you're touching the ground, so for surfaces like that, manual crouch jumping works MUCH better
[3:57:59] <%natebud> Suicide houndeyes NotLikeThis
[3:58:07] <zamzoph> CHEATER SwiftRage
[3:58:13] <awalr> hot dogs
[3:58:13] <portalmaster112> nah crouch jumping in source games are weird
[3:58:15] <%Tuna_Can_0> D:
[3:58:15] <+Rabbitmage> banelings
[3:58:16] <+theKingRamses> doesn't mean that the autocrouch was working
[3:58:16] <+Vorga1339> If you're relying on a broken bandaid option you should learn to not rely on the bandaid
[3:58:16] <+ItsRatman> spicy dogs
[3:58:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> what i even the evolutionary niche of exploding dogs
[3:58:22] <TigerClaws12> every time LUL
[3:58:38] <+Idziman> RULES OF NATURE
[3:58:40] <%Javaa01> Woolie VS Nature
[3:58:45] <derap41> Its like this nice peaceful planet has been corrupted by some invading force
[3:58:46] <pennykettle_> same as animals that are poisonous
[3:58:47] <Shaotanzhiten> Nice shield.
[3:58:53] <%RioGascar> what kinda evolution point is like
[3:58:59] <%RioGascar> Yeah aliens that explode
[3:59:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieVS The Forces of Nature
[3:59:04] <portalmaster112> when are we gonna get examples of literature with woolie
[3:59:05] <UnfilteredComic> Or how Wasps have stingers attached to their hearts
[3:59:08] <Kraahka> @WoolieVersus Turn fast weapon switch off it will help you keep track of your ammo
[3:59:09] <awalr> if there's enough dogs in the hive they can just send waves after waves of their own men
[3:59:10] <alrobot2014> @LiquidDinosaur perhaps they reproduce at a high enough rate to make up for all the explosions
[3:59:11] <+therabbles> wow zen is lookin different
[3:59:22] <Shaotanzhiten> Xen is looking great, it's so pretty now
[3:59:43] <%RioGascar> Yeah this looms pretty and great
[3:59:57] <%RioGascar> i hope crowbar does...idk maybe get hired by valve
[4:00:04] <%RioGascar> maybe make more things
[4:00:12] <Shaotanzhiten> I wouldn't be surprised, Valve tends to do that
[4:00:28] <portalmaster112> eh, i think crowbar collective is good, but i think they need a bit more refinement
[4:00:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> is it just me or do the houndeyes look like that one cute taiko drum mascot?
[4:00:47] <%RioGascar> campo santo devs helped make alyx. Which valley of the gods is currently on hold
[4:01:06] <derap41> s
[4:01:10] <derap41> Oh
[4:01:14] <+therabbles> god i didn't remember that line at all
[4:01:15] <%Javaa01> Carface
[4:01:33] <%RioGascar> crowbar needs refining sure, but its still quality work
[4:01:47] <%Javaa01> Look at where that Red tube goes
[4:01:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:01:53] <%RioGascar> this is a piece in a portfolio you would use for getting a jov
[4:01:54] <%Javaa01> And follow it with your eyes
[4:02:04] <sexdrugsvideogames> tnx reggie
[4:02:13] <%lotharrio> Yeah, thanks. Here's suicide dogs.
[4:02:19] <+That_Mojo> thanks gordon, here is some exploding dogs s thanks
[4:02:20] <derap41> LAZA
[4:02:21] <sexdrugsvideogames> splendid
[4:02:37] <%Irridium> just annihilate that wildlife
[4:02:38] <derap41> Those look familiar don't they
[4:02:42] <%natebud> Tell me Xen, what evolutionary benefit is there to exploding?
[4:03:00] <derap41> @natebud Ask cucumbers
[4:03:17] <+DreyfussFrost> @natebud Ask bombadier beetles.
[4:03:33] <%Javaa01> Pick up that crytal
[4:03:38] <%RioGascar> I mean video game shotguns are also bullshit
[4:03:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> now. put it in the trash can.
[4:03:39] <+ItsRatman> I wouldnt eat an animal that explodes
[4:03:41] <portalmaster112> cs:go tripped me up with shotguns so bad
[4:03:44] <+Rabbitmage> we found the sample!
[4:03:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> So, based on what gluons do, do you think the Gluon Gun is breaking up the protons and neutrons in the target?
[4:03:50] <derap41> BioTech
[4:03:54] <%RioGascar> real life shotguns are way different
[4:04:02] <awalr> high speed metal pellets turn into cotton candy past a few meters
[4:04:03] <+Troispoint> Silencers is the other great video game/movie gun myth
[4:04:04] <%RioGascar> but video game has em act different cause balance
[4:04:05] <%natebud> But are they aggressive or is that a defense mechanism? @DreyfussFrost
[4:04:06] <Shaotanzhiten> Counterstrike shotguns are great, can hit nobody , can snipe someone from across the map, who knows
[4:04:08] <portalmaster112> Forest Slain
[4:04:16] <%Chichen> and super long
[4:04:16] <bleugh> xen PogChamp
[4:04:19] <UnfilteredComic> @natebud Why do bees rip out their intestines when they sting things?
[4:04:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> i've never fired a shotgun, BUT i've fired a shotgun shell out of a revolver.
[4:04:23] <%natebud> @derap41 a lot of good that did, we tamed them with our pickle jars
[4:04:33] <%Tuna_Can_0> @Shaotanzhiten LUL

[4:04:49] <%natebud> @UnfilteredComic yeah, but bees are pretty cool if you don't bother them.
