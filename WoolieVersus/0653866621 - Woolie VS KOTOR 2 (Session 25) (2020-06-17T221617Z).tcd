[0:07:32] <%NopeBadguy> NopeBadguy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! I just finished this game a couple days ago so I can finally watch you see the end. It's a surprisingly poignant Star Wars story that I feel like I was able to relate to a lot with some of my own trauma. Any plans to maybe check out TOR with V?
[0:07:33] <%spiritofmojave> LET'S GOOOOO
[0:07:36] <IcyTvTuber> YEYEYEYE
[0:07:38] <OverlordLuna> SourPls
[0:07:40] <Tomas2886Cz> Thanks for the PrideDragon @nopebadguy

[0:07:47] <%Shinny1338> @datasuna True True. Hate that Supercross will be on at the same time. Guess that's why I have multiple laptops haha
[0:07:47] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> LET‚ÄôS
[0:07:49] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> FUCKING
[0:07:50] <%SmoothEnigma> maaaaan I'm chilling in the pool, I got chicken Fajitas, perfect fucking way to enjoy the finale
[0:07:52] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> GOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:07:59] <%krispen_wa> AND I'M CHALLENGING YOU
[0:08:03] <zeow31> @nopebadguy TOR kinda ruins Revan and kotor 2 sadly
[0:08:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[0:08:05] <megamonmon123> Woolie needs to hear I Believe
[0:08:12] <%M3djedx> Packing a thicc bowl before this shindig
[0:08:15] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR especially ruins the Exile
[0:08:18] <R3c0n31> Damn Atlas, but they hired the right person for Persona Music
[0:08:19] <mycatiscthulhu> LEEEET‚ÄôS GOOOOOO
[0:08:22] <IcyTvTuber> has woolie said anything about p5r or has he not played it?
[0:08:26] <%razielhex> @NopeBadguy They already told me last week they're not gonna hit up SWTOR, but V knows enough about it to talk about the main arc, with the finality of Revan, Surik, and maybe even Vitiate.
[0:08:29] <sekainoowaride> It's not a Game
[0:08:33] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Reminder that Maruki did nothing wrong
[0:08:38] <chll0ne> imo persona 5 wasnt enough jazz for me
[0:08:51] <megamonmon123> hes hasnt played it as far as Im aware and has not said that he has plans to@icytvtuber
[0:08:52] <Doodle_Taco> Reminder that Haru is best girl
[0:08:54] <heartlesshealer> did need more jazz
[0:08:55] <%Shinny1338> @razielhex Twitch caring about copyright now?
[0:08:56] <%DatAsuna> @razielhex my understanding is that they're just gonna go over the basics but not actually the events of swtor
[0:09:05] <%M3djedx> @doodle_taco A man of culture
[0:09:08] <IcyTvTuber> Maruki was a hero with a different end goal
[0:09:08] <%razielhex> I think some of the nuance of SWTOR's quests will be lost.
[0:09:09] <%krispen_wa> reminder that Makoto is bland as hell
[0:09:12] <Second_Omega> Haru highest quality
[0:09:16] <%DatAsuna> The only SWTOR video stuff I gave them was the trailers V said they should watch
[0:09:17] <%SmoothEnigma> it's a shame they won't be even giving SWOTOR a one-shot. I personally love the MMO to death, Smuggler class for LIFE
[0:09:26] <chll0ne> reminder that p5 doesnt have best girl PRChase
[0:09:30] <%M3djedx> Haru possible Yandre
[0:09:37] <+Loreknows> blessed image
[0:09:38] <%DatAsuna> I'm not gonna crunch 200 hours of quests into a digestible video
[0:09:43] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR's class quests are good...everything else though...
[0:09:45] <%razielhex> SWTOR Jedi knight is KOTOR3. Period.
[0:09:50] <sekainoowaride> Do it
[0:09:54] <heartlesshealer> !
[0:09:55] <%Shinny1338> From what I remember the SWOTOR trailers are just cool. not related to KOTOR
[0:09:55] <+MrProw> Marie is the best character in the entire Persona series 4Head
[0:09:58] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR Jedi Knight is bland as fuck
[0:09:58] <AvailableThor> !
[0:09:59] <Doodle_Taco> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:10:00] <R3c0n31> @SmoothEnigma I think its the early game that kills it for most people. I had to push myself past it where i began to love it

[0:21:59] <%bigmacjack12> Cheer500 on the topic of grey force users, there are several force using traditions that fall under this category. My favorite is the jensaari who are a blend of jedi and Sith teaching, they hold off the temptation of the dark side with discipline and use force attuned armor.

[0:23:08] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO thx <3
[0:23:11] <%2hutown> lets be honest here. the SWTOR isnt an mmo. its a rpg that has people run around with you
[0:23:23] <IcyTvTuber> swtor is absolutely not an lpable game
[0:23:23] <%krispen_wa> It's an RPG with terrible fleet chat
[0:23:27] <montgomerynw> SWTOR... is fine... a single player KOTOR 3 would've been much better but the game is alright.
[0:23:30] <%WutangchickeN> queue Woolie and V play FIFA 18 my team
[0:23:35] <+PlagueOfGripes> there's a LOT
[0:23:38] <%NopeBadguy> Check the Video Essay "The Failure of the Grey Jedi" for more
[0:23:42] <%ChoculaUltra> god that fleet chat. Volkarion should've glassed both fleets.
[0:23:46] <%DatAsuna> Swtor's fine as an MMO, you just don't wanna do the mmo content
[0:23:47] <+jiggy_snipe> its a spectrum Kappa
[0:23:52] <%DatAsuna> It has some of the best raids.
[0:23:54] <%optimasmaximas> woolie will prob like the night sisters
[0:23:55] <+dumbgamerboy> SWTOR is not a good videogame. But doing a wikidive on the story highlights is a decent use of time. And of course those cg trailers are pretty amazing.
[0:23:56] <+Freeborg23> Doesn't Dawn of Jedi show that the Jedi started out grey, and then they become light side.
[0:23:57] <%VCRUZZO> @2hutown I actually agree with that sentiment
[0:24:09] <aiutare47> Night sisters are lit
[0:24:10] <+Takuatt> I don't mind Grey Force users i.e The Bendu but grey jedi don't make much no sense to me
[0:24:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> people also conflate "jedi" with the middle ground of the force and also the idea of a unified force. they're all different ideas
[0:24:15] <+Feralspirit41> Mother Talzen from the clone wars and the nightsisters viewed the force as an extension of the spirits and believed that it was embodied by two actual dieties
[0:24:18] <%Shinny1338> @wutangchicken I mean minus the My team and just like team manager would be cool. I really enjoyed Rahul playing FIFA with FH
[0:24:19] <akman14> Purple gang
[0:24:19] <mesamus> plague in chat!
[0:24:20] <%quinnage7> That video makes some leaps in logic
[0:24:22] <+oda_flobunaga> Warhammer 40K Spess Mahreen?
[0:24:22] <XeroSigmaPrime> Night Sisters are FUCKING SICK
[0:24:23] <%krispen_wa> A whole race of big titty goth jedi
[0:24:28] <%lotharrio> I wish that there were like... 6 other large "orders" of force users, who just thought the Jedi and Sith were insane.
[0:24:31] <BeastCrusader> How long has WoolieVersus been streaming?
[0:24:37] <+tearfuldevil> @Freeborg23 if you want to take into consideration Dawn of the Force as canon, sure, i guess
[0:24:39] <IcyTvTuber> i got 420 channel points Pog
[0:24:39] <%Gruhunchously> !uptime
[0:24:39] <%bigmacjack12> Yeah pretty much
[0:24:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 24 minutes and 50 seconds
[0:24:46] <%DatAsuna> I hate the nightsisters lol
[0:24:49] <BeastCrusader> Oh thanks, new to chat
[0:24:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Jedi and Sith both conspire to purge any nuance and 3rd parties. They love bi-partisan politics that force everyone towards an extreme end of the scale.
[0:24:54] <%DatAsuna> Not quite
[0:24:57] <alephalpha> is it over?
[0:25:00] <%GrassCannon> Slavery is a choice LUL
[0:25:02] <+pizzadeliveryman> i think it just started
[0:25:04] <time_axis> I think Sion fits that too
[0:25:06] <XeroSigmaPrime> @DatAsuna NANI?!
[0:25:07] <%DatAsuna> The lesson of strength is actually 4 lessons. lol
[0:25:12] <GHouseduivel> @GrassCannon Okay Kanya
[0:25:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus No V the TRUE lesson of strenght comes after
[0:25:13] <+tearfuldevil> @GeneralSCPatton the force is a two party system LUL
[0:25:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Nightsisters riding Rancors into battle is pretty fly
[0:25:26] <%DatAsuna> The true lesson of strength is to reject the lesson of strength
[0:25:36] <ShoggothLord> I meant "Turn away from strength that is not your own."
[0:25:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> something weird about Hanharr is Kreia's optional lesson that you should not draw power from him either, because it isn't your own. YET the whole game is you doing just that
[0:25:40] <%NopeBadguy> The true lesson of strength is to reject strength that is not your own
[0:25:40] <%Gruhunchously> Reject strength that is not your own
[0:25:44] <GHouseduivel> An-Force
[0:25:44] <naoi0> Did they finish the game?
[0:25:51] <+MrProw> One of them did
[0:25:57] <Joestar1890> Aren't anacrhist force users just rouge sith?
[0:26:00] <%Javaa01> Or bathrobe, I guess
[0:26:01] <%krispen_wa> ONE MORE STRENGTH REJECTED
[0:26:02] <e3a4> V make sure you and Woolie watch the Nihilus and Sion clip on youtube when you finish
[0:26:03] <akman14> The anarchist force users would die of hunger in less than a week
[0:26:04] <arkv01> rules are for dorks! *force chokes a random strangers*
[0:26:05] <BurdRightsActivist> madmax force users
[0:26:06] <+pizzadeliveryman> HYPE
[0:26:07] <%krispen_wa> Here we go bois
[0:26:10] <+thequickbrownrabbit> All force users are basterds-kreia
[0:26:11] <ashenjuan25> Anarcho syndicalist jedis
[0:26:12] <%Gruhunchously> This is it
[0:26:14] <OverlordLuna> YEYEYEYE
[0:26:16] <%NopeBadguy> I also want to shout out the Video Essay "The Philosophy of Kreia" once you guys finish because it's a great analysis of Star Wars in the context of KOTOR 2
[0:26:18] <StarlitStunner> finoTB it begins
[0:26:18] <Halospaz117> LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
[0:26:20] <ShoggothLord> Anarchist Force users would be pretty light side
[0:26:20] <%Shinny1338> Once More Into The Breach
[0:26:23] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> HERE WE GO
[0:26:24] <+tearfuldevil> the true lesson of strength is dumb, cause kreia can't draw strength from others like the exile can
[0:26:24] <%M3djedx> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:26:27] <VJdarkworld> dead air PogChamp
[0:26:34] <+dumbgamerboy> @akman14 topical
[0:26:38] <+Nothing_Wild> Anarchist Force users are adherents of the order of Chaz.
[0:26:38] <%optimasmaximas> wait i have to watch it where?
[0:26:44] <+Freeborg23> That dead silence is essential to understanding the story.
[0:26:48] <+Nothing_Wild> They‚Äôre called ‚ÄúChazzites.‚Äù
[0:26:52] <%lotharrio> Twitter, it's on twitter.
[0:26:54] <+oda_flobunaga> Shouldn't the Anime be the one with all the extra filler?
[0:26:55] <%Gruhunchously> Poor Sion
[0:26:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> going to be a long discussion after completing the game. and during
[0:26:59] <%krispen_wa> CHAZZ IT UP
[0:27:00] <prince_johnny_> lets goo
[0:27:03] <%heartlesshealer> It is time
[0:27:08] <mattynezz> And spinning, ALWAYS SPINNING TOWARDS FREEDOM!
[0:27:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @oda_flobunaga maybe its more that Youtube is an OVA
[0:27:13] <+JustToWatch> twirling, twirling towards freedom
[0:27:15] <+dumbgamerboy> Darth CHAZ
[0:27:19] <%Gruhunchously> Who's ready for TRIPLE WIELDING?
[0:27:21] <%optimasmaximas> @lotharrio what does that mean? like they post clips of it on twitter?
[0:27:25] <Joestar1890> BIG lightsabers
[0:27:26] <vulkan_vibes> avanti sempre. sempre avanti.
[0:27:32] <%razielhex> Darth Sion? Ahh well.
[0:27:35] <+BlockingDisabled> Remember we don't know where T3 and Atton went...
[0:27:39] <%heartlesshealer> Darth Remains
[0:27:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> oh, I missed that part obviously
[0:27:41] <StarlitStunner> Hold a third lightsaber in your mouth like Zoro
[0:27:44] <+Takuatt> that Black Series Darth Revan saber fucks
[0:27:46] <+armor_kuma> Living Corpse into Corpse into Corpse Nothing
[0:27:51] <dinnydanny777> Maybe she didn't know what he is either
[0:27:57] <bbblaketwitching> Please press W, im dying inside. I cannot describe how hype I am.
[0:27:59] <%krispen_wa> Nihilus is just you if you were an asshole. You don't need a backstory
[0:28:01] <huskarl_zap> you open the door but its ROHENIDEHLO SOCCOR
[0:28:03] <+Freeborg23> Are you ever going to finish your reaction to the MGS4 youtube movie?
[0:28:04] <TransDoomGuy> W
[0:28:09] <%M3djedx> This LP has been the perfect follow up to the Pockets saga, thank you guys!
[0:28:10] <IcyTvTuber> HERE WE GO BOIS
[0:28:14] <mattynezz> Nihilus being super powerful, but totally irrelevent, is kind of the point.
[0:28:14] <snakemuho> FINAL BOSS ARENA
[0:28:15] <%Gruhunchously> The music, man
[0:28:16] <Joostebrood> again very Avellone-y this
[0:28:17] <%razielhex> I always considered Nihlus to be a kind of Force Revenant
[0:28:18] <%heartlesshealer> YEYEYE
[0:28:20] <zeow31> I mean, you're not supposed to emphatise with Nihilus... He's just raw power
[0:28:20] <%Space_Pagan> HERE WE GOOOOOO
[0:28:20] <subjectg> I think nihilus being a relative unknown is good in its own right

[0:29:27] <endarren> Why is the audio crackling?
[0:29:27] <dinnydanny777> Let's be real here, if we chokeslammed her right now like Sion did she would probably respect it
[0:29:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> Uptime!
[0:29:31] <arkv01> "put your controller down, fann'y pak, I will show you my power"
[0:29:33] <mattynezz> Telling her it's not too late is super lame, but it's also THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE OF DIALOGUE IN THE GAME
[0:29:34] <%M3djedx> She looks so much better full with mode
[0:29:36] <%krispen_wa> It's just another mask
[0:29:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> How Dark Side do you think she is right now? IIRC her aura is pink rn
[0:29:38] <%spiritofmojave> Granny got that goth drip

[0:30:32] <dinnydanny777> Why does Kreia believe she should get to decide that
[0:30:44] <endarren> I think it's fixed. I refreshed a second time and it went away
[0:30:45] <+armor_kuma> She said the thing LUL
[0:30:45] <ashenjuan25> Man fuck that one guy

[0:30:57] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 Atris deserved it

[0:31:00] <%Irridium> she was thirstin' pretty hard
[0:31:03] <+Kyma1020> No
[0:31:03] <%GrassCannon> she wanted the Pak
[0:31:04] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia speaking about herself here as well
[0:31:04] <+Feralspirit41> Atris wanted what was in Fanns pak
[0:31:04] <GHouseduivel> @krispen_wa Yes
[0:31:04] <Halospaz117> Oh yeah, she was THIRSTY
[0:31:05] <%M3djedx> Herself
[0:31:10] <%Coo_coo1> VOD boys coming in at the end live!
[0:31:10] <Firststrike_OW> LUL
[0:31:11] <+torusendor> Granny lookin pretty thicc beneath those robes
[0:31:11] <+jiggy_snipe> sure...
[0:31:13] <%NopeBadguy> "please dont use the lightsaber as a dildo"
[0:31:17] <+PlagueOfGripes> the metal is corroded, granny
[0:31:17] <+HollowMan190> okay JJ
[0:31:20] <+oda_flobunaga> it came from the fish market...
[0:31:25] <dinnydanny777> Sure but why does Kreia think she has the authority to decide who can do whatever
[0:31:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pickled lightsaber
[0:31:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @torusendor the clap of her asscheeks is creating echoes in the Force
[0:31:36] <Joestar1890> There must always be a BETRAYAL
[0:31:36] <MyNameIsRasus> That's a risky dildo if I ever saw one
[0:31:38] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 She is THE sith lord
[0:31:40] <%VCRUZZO> why she so obsessed with me...girl you a Mad Hoe
[0:31:42] <megamonmon123> Ma Kin Nations
[0:31:43] <ashenjuan25> The milk‚Äôs gone bad
[0:31:45] <mattynezz> But what does Kreia want you to become?
[0:31:45] <+PlagueOfGripes> ECHOOOO
[0:31:47] <+torusendor> @LiquidDinosaur Drink
[0:31:52] <e3a4> She loved you, like one loves a shower head.
[0:31:53] <+armor_kuma> Im gonna shoot you with this gun and its a TEST
[0:31:54] <jericholite> there can only be two. student must best master to prove theyre worthy
[0:31:56] <startstoprepeat> machinations, from the spiran word machina
[0:31:56] <%heartlesshealer> maa-kih-nay-shuns
[0:31:58] <shiibbae> echoooooooooo
[0:32:05] <dinnydanny777> @ghouseduivel Mhmm, sure, that doesn't answer my question.
[0:32:16] <+dumbgamerboy> It's also incredibly common for Jedi to do, remember Juhani in Kotor1
[0:32:25] <%DSD24> I think 2 makes sense
[0:32:30] <chromdad> A TEST = Merely PRETENDING
[0:32:33] <%Ashenik1> look at that sith grandma ass Kreygasm
[0:32:34] <Doodle_Taco> The way I took it was that she HAS to be dark side because you are lightside. The universe demands it for balance
[0:32:38] <Joostebrood> I mean you never saw Atris & Exile getting along pre-war.
[0:32:40] <+Nothing_Wild> I think she meant that, power comes with admiration. Not necessarily that it was platonic, but that she was attracted to the power, fame, and infamy of a champion.

[0:35:38] <Archmortal> In Revan she saw its heart. In you she sees its death.
[0:35:42] <%Space_Pagan> All of this because Kreia wanted to flex of god
[0:35:48] <JetpackMcQuack> It‚Äôs great
[0:35:48] <308caliber> fuck the force, it has caused an endless cycle of war/death between light and dark
[0:35:50] <phatmac16> THE AGE OF MAN STARTS NOW!
[0:35:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> no one knows what the force is. just that there's a division between living force and cosmic force. and something exists beyond what you use

[0:36:57] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:37:01] <dinnydanny777> @ghouseduivel Yeah but that doesn't matter? She still hasn't given a reason for her feigning authority on this subject as if she knows all.
[0:37:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Force seems to choose some people to fall into apathy and others to fall into corruption, all for some bullshit "balance" that seesaws back and forth all the time
[0:37:05] <+tearfuldevil> @krispen_wa they hadn't been more than hinted at in novels and shit at this point
[0:37:05] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @bbblaketwitching is totes right
[0:37:11] <dinnydanny777> She's just playing God
[0:37:12] <Joestar1890> Sequels? You mean the Thrawn trilogy, V?
[0:37:22] <+Nothing_Wild> The Disney trilogy.
[0:37:23] <+oda_flobunaga> I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE!
[0:37:26] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 Exactly, play god, to destroy god
[0:37:27] <JohnAtDawn> Nah, but magic is worth it
[0:37:28] <+Nothing_Wild> Oh wait.
[0:37:28] <+armor_kuma> @Freeborg23 Well the theres people who are dead spots like the exile and bao dur and nihilus so SOME people have to survive
[0:37:30] <Archmortal> The prophecy wasn't even that Anakin would destroy the sith, it was that he would bring balance. And he did. And Kreia fucking hates the cost of that
[0:37:35] <%krispen_wa> @tearfuldevil Nah, the Vong saga was written waaay before this
[0:37:38] <DeathByPoke7> kill the plot ghosts
[0:37:46] <+ntfth> Fun fact, prior to Disney buying it out, the Light Side is never mentioned in the films. Its only the Force and the Dark Side.
[0:37:46] <Bruno_Tropical> I like to think that the Force is a living organism that requires the light and dark sides to sustain itself and survive
[0:37:50] <%heartlesshealer> kill the time jannies
[0:37:52] <Joestar1890> Kreia doesn't apparently
[0:37:55] <%Gruhunchously> EVERYONE has had that moment
[0:37:56] <jericholite> lol too relatable
[0:37:56] <Dementedpenguin> Death Star destroys a few planets, Anakin doesn't care. His own son gets shocked, turns a leaf. Kappa
[0:37:58] <dinnydanny777> @ghouseduivel Yeah sure, while not seeing the irony in slating other people for playing God huh?
[0:38:01] <memejima> Anakin bringing balance was by him destroying both the Jedi and then the Sith later
[0:38:03] <bbblaketwitching> Constant eternal dark and lightside war tho
[0:38:07] <%DSD24> "I ain't your bro"
[0:38:07] <%SmoothEnigma> I wish I could force levitate my phone right now
[0:38:09] <dinnydanny777> No one else deserves to play God but me
[0:38:09] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> done it but not since 2009
[0:38:10] <%Sedrelic> mmmagic missile
[0:38:11] <bbblaketwitching> that is the alternative
[0:38:14] <%Gruhunchously> @Joestar1890 Kreia has absolutely had that moment, and we'll talk about that in second
[0:38:14] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 To make sure there isn't another god
[0:38:18] <Bruno_Tropical> but the ghosts saved Barret
[0:38:27] <Joestar1890> This is also the same woman who HATES IT when you save people and do charitable things for them
[0:38:27] <JohnAtDawn> THEY ARE
[0:38:28] <+tearfuldevil> @krispen_wa wait you're right, huh. i thought they were written way later.
[0:38:29] <dinnydanny777> @ghouseduivel So she's full of shit and powerhungry
[0:38:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> NOBODY FORCED YOU TO BE A JEDI COUNSELOR. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A GUARDIAN YOU LAZY BITCH
[0:38:32] <samura1_queen19> The whispers from ff7 are the worst
[0:38:34] <jericholite> hypocrite but An aware one at that
[0:38:38] <McCune> I ‚Äúuse the force‚Äù on sliding doors
[0:38:39] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 Exactly
[0:38:43] <+oda_flobunaga> Like Conservatives and Medicare?
[0:38:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @XeroSigmaPrime
[0:38:49] <plankk56> the ghosts were the worst part of 7R
[0:38:57] <huskarl_zap> kill moobot
[0:38:59] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur She was a consular before wanting to kill the force
[0:39:00] <XeroSigmaPrime> God this is already amazing
[0:39:09] <+ntfth> Balance wasn't wiping out the Jedi and Sith. It was wiping out the Sith because the Dark Side *is* the imbalance. At least at one point because Lucas changes his mind all the time.
[0:39:12] <megamonmon123> baby baby baby
[0:39:15] <Psyramics> Remember that she's blind. She can only "see" through the Force. She would be blinding herself by killing the Force.
[0:39:15] <%Coo_coo1> Imagine if every time you dropped a gummy bear on the floor you could stop it midway, and then imagine this old ass saying she wants to take that away from you
[0:39:19] <%Irridium> how long she's been alive, either
[0:39:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @oda_flobunaga Kreia is the best villain because she isnt trying to conquer the galaxy or consome all souls. She's just a Libertarian. A relatable and familiar form of Evil.
[0:39:31] <%spiritofmojave> we have no idea of her age yeah
[0:39:44] <jericholite> @coo_coo1 never
[0:39:46] <zeow31> @ntfth Nah, Lucas is pretty consistent on the whole darkside thing
[0:39:49] <%krispen_wa> @LiquidDinosaur That's STRONG
[0:39:52] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur far more terrible LUL
[0:40:03] <%Gruhunchously> Whatever she was teaching at the Academy, Sion and Nihilus clearly weren't okay with it. Sion even calls them 'teachings that weaken us.'
[0:40:05] <samura1_queen19> @coo_coo1 playing tug of war with the force for the gummy bear
[0:40:07] <RamenRiderZ> Kreia is the kid who takes her ball and leaves
[0:40:11] <%Ashenik1> she basically wants to destroy the nukes but on the Earth's surface
[0:40:17] <+oda_flobunaga> @LiquidDinosaur I know, I'm just being flippant
[0:40:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> the Force is bailing people out and denying them the ability to Bootstrap themselves
[0:40:34] <GHouseduivel> @RamenRiderZ More like how much she hates how awful everyone is playing her game.
[0:40:36] <memejima> She wants to use the mechanics of the Force to destroy it
[0:40:45] <Bruno_Tropical> @Gruhunchously because she hates the Force and was trying to make them stop using it?
[0:40:45] <%Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur But the Force is VERY choosy about who it bails out.
[0:40:47] <megamonmon123> shes thanos
[0:40:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> NO FORCE OR KINGS. ONLY CRUSTY HUNGRY BOIS
[0:40:55] <dinnydanny777> You know considering Sion and Nihilus were literally walking corpses Kreia's kind of acting like a petulant child
[0:41:01] <huskarl_zap> DEW IT
[0:41:27] <%Space_Pagan> DRINK
[0:41:30] <megamonmon123> kill the past
[0:41:31] <XeroSigmaPrime> HOLY FUCK THIS IS GOOD
[0:41:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> i bet that the students had a ritual where they had to streak across this core

[0:41:54] <%optimasmaximas> i wish i knew wtf was going on so i could be this hype as the rest of you
[0:41:57] <%optimasmaximas> fuck
[0:42:05] <GHouseduivel> The force is the best Drug in the galaxy
[0:42:11] <Joostebrood> ('To draw you here.' = Kreia doesn't actually destroy the force here, the point is it being your test. Somehow people still do not get this.)
[0:42:12] <%Gruhunchously> oof, you would need an entire games worth of context
[0:42:16] <memejima> So she wants you to either join her or silence the echoes?
[0:42:18] <Bruno_Tropical> @optimasmaximas Kreia wants you to kill the Force
[0:42:19] <Joostebrood> *want to destroy
[0:42:20] <%M3djedx> @ghouseduivel Other than death sticks
[0:42:21] <dinnydanny777> @zeow31 Yeah but perspective right? Like "Well I could have been a walking pile of skin flakes or a starving eldritch being, could be worse"
[0:42:22] <therakishsage> Well, one of the main points of contention that she has with you is that she's not a leader and she's not DESTINED for great things. She's doomed to simply be an enabler for other greater people, and it's because the Force says so.
[0:42:24] <RamenRiderZ> Lightsaber Graveyard PogChamp PogChamp
[0:42:32] <%VCRUZZO> @optimasmaximas did you just join, cause that sucks to get in at this poimt
[0:42:35] <mattynezz> She does destroy the Force, she shows that it isn't needed through the Exile
[0:42:35] <+PlagueOfGripes> death in the force is basically the circle of life style logic
[0:42:41] <%NopeBadguy> Think of it this way: the Force is the Lifestream @WoolieVersus
[0:42:41] <%SmoothEnigma> murder heaven
[0:42:43] <GHouseduivel> @M3djedx You will go home and re-think your life
[0:42:43] <Doodle_Taco> She hates to not have agency, so I imagine she hates the afterlife
[0:42:50] <dinnydanny777> If there's no force is there death?
[0:42:50] <aiutare47> Force can cure cancer, bring back the dead, and make you immortal. But it‚Äôs a cold bitch too.
[0:42:51] <+oda_flobunaga> Is it better to be killed by an abusive boyfriend, or to die alone and unloved?
[0:42:51] <%Gruhunchously> No ghost for you
[0:42:53] <%GrassCannon> Save file corrupted
[0:42:53] <%SmoothEnigma> MURDER HEAVEN TO GAIN FREE WILL
[0:42:55] <memejima> To be fair, being condemned by fate to be a side character WOULD be shitty
[0:42:56] <jericholite> isn't the force in everything?
[0:42:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is not ceasing to exist worth being a cosmic pawn of some eldritch bullshit?
[0:42:57] <%optimasmaximas> @Bruno_Tropical oh ok, and i meant like knew everything throughout the entire journey so i know the context
[0:42:58] <%M3djedx> @ghouseduivel I wanna go home, and re think my life.
[0:43:00] <%SouLucha> Worried are we, Woolie?
[0:43:00] <%krispen_wa> DESTROY HEAVEN
[0:43:01] <jericholite> it's all life
[0:43:02] <dinnydanny777> Wait is the Force the Cloud?
[0:43:06] <GHouseduivel> @M3djedx LUL
[0:43:07] <dinnydanny777> Is the force the Cloud?
[0:43:10] <%heartlesshealer> Uninstall Heaven . exe
[0:43:11] <MyNameIsRasus> ATTACK AND DETHRONE GOD
[0:43:12] <bbblaketwitching> The force is instigating and guarantees consistent mega-wars. That's allota death. Forever.
[0:43:12] <R3c0n31> so at most like 90% of the universe is gonna die, including the realms of death
[0:43:13] <%Gruhunchously> Delete the cloud
[0:43:14] <%Irridium> The Force is 5G
[0:43:15] <%Jetzord> WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE PATCH WRECKED MY SAVE FILE?
[0:43:15] <dinnydanny777> Are we hacking the Cloud
[0:43:15] <memejima> ‚ÄúI am one with the force the force is with me‚Äù that guy would STRAIGHT UP DIE
[0:43:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[0:43:17] <%lotharrio> Attack God and delete heaven
[0:43:18] <subjectg> if anything, it‚Äôs a win-win for her. Either she wins and achieves ending the force, or you become stronger by defeating her and passing on what it means to be an ideal jedi
[0:43:21] <Joostebrood> (Her wanting to destroy the Force here was bait - it's not actually what she wants to do right now)
[0:43:22] <XeroSigmaPrime> @NopeBadguy Nah, cuz you need the lifestream. But Fanny is proof the force isnt needed
[0:43:23] <%spiritofmojave> CLEAN THE LIFE STREAM, WIPE HISTORY
[0:43:23] <%2hutown> Kill god, burn heaven
[0:43:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @therakishsage ..........so she WOULD be a conqueror but she realizes she's not fated to be so so she's just bitter about it and is being a deceitful manipulator out of spite?
[0:43:28] <zeow31> @dinnydanny777 And through perspective she realize... "F*ck, I could've been like them if I relied too much on it... That shit needs to go"
[0:43:28] <$Invlux> Fresh eyes
[0:43:28] <+PlagueOfGripes> Kreia doesn't really know, nor do we
[0:43:28] <dinnydanny777> Kreia is Sephiroth
[0:43:29] <jericholite> lol
[0:43:29] <Bruno_Tropical> THANOS
[0:43:29] <%alpacasintophats> we're sending the Cloud to delete the Cloud

[0:43:33] <+cvp5127> deleting the past avatars
[0:43:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @thealientrilogy and she convinces herself that she's doing it out of some idealistic crusade?
[0:43:43] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO ive caught some of these kotor streams here and there and i think the last one i saw was when they arrived on that planet where the people would be like "why tf is a jedi here?!"
[0:43:46] <Make_me_mad> They'd still have libraries.
[0:43:51] <%SouLucha> Some good that HAS DONE.
[0:43:51] <+Mondeiya> i mean do spirits show up much anyways?
[0:43:51] <%alpacasintophats> straight up suplexing the throne of heroes
[0:43:55] <aiutare47> Reset button to kill god
[0:43:56] <Joestar1890> Destroy the lifestream
[0:43:57] <bbblaketwitching> But Google would stop controlling the planet from the shadows
[0:44:00] <Make_me_mad> Those ghosts can piss off and stop fucking with those still living.
[0:44:01] <time_axis> well, "lives"
[0:44:03] <%kyh9> Not just the 99% of all life now but 99.999999999999% of all life that has ever existed ever
[0:44:03] <jericholite> everyone and everything living would even desd
[0:44:03] <XeroSigmaPrime> KILL THE FORCE
[0:44:04] <+Mondeiya> not like you can communicate with the force ghosts often enough
[0:44:06] <%kyh9> Destroying the past
[0:44:07] <VJdarkworld> Attack and Dethrone Existence
[0:44:08] <samura1_queen19> Keira is White Diamond
[0:44:09] <%DSD24> Would Kreia be a Avenger?
[0:44:09] <%kyh9> BURN THE PAST
[0:44:09] <boostergoldz> and yet you prove life can live without it
[0:44:10] <bbblaketwitching> delete the cloud
[0:44:11] <jericholite> thanos times 2
[0:44:13] <R3c0n31> Sure Phanny Pak is the proof you can live without the force, it doesnt mean the other 99% can
[0:44:15] <Doodle_Taco> I love how this is similar to FF6, in which the only way to trulu move forward is to delete magic
[0:44:16] <%Gruhunchously> What are they thinking right now, I wonder. The Force Ghosts
[0:44:16] <%krispen_wa> FORCE ATHEISM INTO THE WORLD
[0:44:20] <megamirk> Kreia just hates how people rely too much on the force and how it creates problems, she's not as much of a radical as you're saying
[0:44:21] <+cvp5127> destroy the afterlife
[0:44:21] <memejima> Delete Heaven Hell and Everything Else
[0:44:22] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO think i could binge the yt vids fast enough to catch up and watch this vod to see the chat's input?
[0:44:22] <%NopeBadguy> Always remember that Final Fantasy is Star Wars if you look hard enough
[0:44:22] <dinnydanny777> This is basically Exdeath and the Void
[0:44:24] <%Ashenik1> so she creates our reality :(
[0:44:24] <Amardeux> The dead should not affect the living, so just delete the force
[0:44:28] <Hammatime8> Bro, does the force not back up its data?
[0:44:28] <T_Sasquatch> Yea... That's a bit much
[0:44:33] <+Exicuren> Freeing The Seventh Fonnon
[0:44:34] <Amardeux> *should not guide
[0:44:34] <bbblaketwitching> to be fair, those people are already dead
[0:44:36] <kylejefferies> !uptime
[0:44:36] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> as suda 51 says "Kill The Past"
[0:44:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 44 minutes and 47 seconds
[0:44:37] <308caliber> but at least everyone will be free from the force's will
[0:44:39] <+armor_kuma> So Kreia wants the Flame to die and make the Darksouls Dark era happen?
[0:44:39] <+MidnightBurst12> and this reality sucks
[0:44:39] <%sunriser101> we dont have it, as far as we know
[0:44:40] <therakishsage> That's the price of FREEDOM.
[0:44:42] <%SouLucha> Yeah, and we are doing "fine." LUL
[0:44:43] <%krispen_wa> Is this Loss?
[0:44:44] <T_Sasquatch> you don't , I DO.
[0:44:45] <R3c0n31> you get doubled killed
[0:44:48] <%VCRUZZO> @optimasmaximas oof no thats too much to catch up to current
[0:44:51] <Joestar1890> @krispen_wa Force Atheism sounds like a weird technique
[0:44:55] <%OldManJEWc> Wasn't this in a Woolie Vs God episode?? @woolieversus
[0:44:55] <%SouLucha> Force the Star War universe to our standards!
[0:44:57] <memejima> Kreia wants the Age of Man from Dark Souls
[0:44:57] <MillaMoks> That all assumes the Jedi force afterlife is the only afterlife
[0:45:03] <%NopeBadguy> I hate the Force. ALL MY HOMIES hate the Force.
[0:45:12] <bbblaketwitching> they just lose their retirement benefits
[0:45:14] <kylejefferies> i was here
[0:45:14] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO oh no i mean before the vod gets deleted after the 60 day window
[0:45:15] <dinnydanny777> I still don't understand how she's going to do this to be honest
[0:45:26] <jericholite> by using the main character
[0:45:28] <subjectg> From a meta standpoint, consider that by killing the force, you would remove interest in star wars because the force is what made the universe special, therefore achieving peace in the galaxy
[0:45:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sorry little Billy, Heaven is cancelled and your grandpa's soul has been deleted, because of a mad granny hoe wanting cosmic freedom.
[0:45:32] <jericholite> he's a hole in the force
[0:45:34] <%NopeBadguy> @dinnydanny777 By using Malachor to expand the wound in the Force IIRC.
[0:45:38] <dinnydanny777> Oh right I forgot
[0:45:38] <%spiritofmojave> she was perfectly open with that conduct, why would the Exile not see that
[0:45:41] <%Coo_coo1> she does kinda sound like the narrator from the Dark Souls intro don't she
[0:45:42] <%Gruhunchously> That's a reference to a piece of cut content
[0:45:53] <%VCRUZZO> @optimasmaximas oh yeah you'll have to to catch up then
[0:45:55] <bbblaketwitching> @subjectg this is what I love
[0:45:58] <%Ashenik1> wikileaks
[0:46:01] <XeroSigmaPrime> @dinnydanny777 Force controls too much, like fate. She doesnt want that. She gonna use Malachor to end it
[0:46:07] <Camail> well then
[0:46:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GeneralSCPatton Kreia retconned my Jedi Master's soul out of purgatory
[0:46:17] <T_Sasquatch> Stop being such a perfect character jeex
[0:46:19] <memejima> She wanted you to beat ALL the Force Users
[0:46:20] <wowowinsane> her delivery is so incredible
[0:46:26] <mattynezz> So the Jedi COULD BE DESTROYED, except SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO KILL THEM, she was forced to
[0:46:27] <%krispen_wa> This is some Sun Li the Glorious Strategist shit
[0:46:30] <%NopeBadguy> The only Jedi left are your party, Atris, and Revan.
[0:46:33] <+armor_kuma> Kreia is like "Nah fuck linking the flames dark lords for life"
[0:46:33] <%NopeBadguy> And Bastila.
[0:46:35] <%Ashenik1> yeah the Kreia actress is amazing
[0:46:37] <huskarl_zap> What about Borohomere tho?
[0:46:37] <Hammatime8> But Fann's not gone, baby. B)
[0:46:40] <Joestar1890> I think the only Sith left is Revan
[0:46:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> yeah Fann Y'Pakk is the one who rebuilds the Jedi Order
[0:46:52] <%Gruhunchously> @mattynezz I think she's pulling an 'I meant to do that' here.
[0:46:53] <boostergoldz> she's still lying to you here
[0:46:53] <GHouseduivel> The Jedi killed themselves with their Hubris
[0:46:57] <%SmoothEnigma> @mattynezz I mean, the jedi are still gone if they realized what she wanted them to, so technically still destroyed
[0:46:58] <memejima> So do the whills become Frampt and Kaathe when the force dies?
[0:46:59] <Bruno_Tropical> All i want is a version of Star Wars where there are characters who can use all kinds of magical shit without the Force. The jedi are the Paladins, let there be Necromancers and Clerics too.
[0:47:00] <+alexisofthestars> alexisofthestars subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:47:03] <zeow31> @mattynezz She wanted the moral victory, to show them they were wrong but they forced her hand
[0:47:04] <huskarl_zap> psaWhat_SG
[0:47:04] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO yeah, ill try to see if i can catch up on between rides to and from work and on break, and whenever else im free and feel like watchin some more :)
[0:47:10] <RamenRiderZ> Kill the Lords of Cinder, end the flame
[0:47:13] <%heartlesshealer> Nice

[0:47:15] <Halospaz117> NO REVAN TWIST HERE

[0:47:16] <phatmac16> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:47:17] <dinnydanny777> When this game ends does Revan go to war with Fann and his Jedi
[0:47:17] <XeroSigmaPrime> THIS IS GOOD
[0:47:17] <jericholite> @bruno_tropical dude badass idea
[0:47:17] <%Irridium> "you ain't getting your KOTOR twist, bitch"
[0:47:18] <ht109> i love this game
[0:47:19] <%Space_Pagan> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:47:20] <prince_johnny_> damn
[0:47:20] <%Gruhunchously> NO TWIST HERE

[0:47:27] <%NopeBadguy> THERE IS NO TWIST. DIE.
[0:47:27] <Tomas2886Cz> SO GOOD
[0:47:29] <%Gruhunchously> RIAN JOHNSON TAKE NOTES
[0:47:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> You were a bitch
[0:47:34] <phatmac16> RIAN JOHNSON IS DEAD
[0:47:34] <%SmoothEnigma> FANI IS THE TWIST
[0:47:37] <%spiritofmojave> NO JOKE. DIE.
[0:47:37] <subjectg> NO GIMMICKS
[0:47:38] <mattynezz> My point about DESTROYED THE JEDI, is that DESTROYED doesn't mean to literally kill, in her vocabulary
[0:47:39] <samura1_queen19> So she was controlling him to get revenge on the people who hurt and to duck over everyone she sees as a threat and now want to kill the person whom she saw worthy?
[0:47:40] <Joestar1890> @NopeBadguy Was Bastilla confirmed to be alive in the Dark Side path?
[0:47:40] <olaksi> The twist was inside you all along
[0:47:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> were you expecting a hackney writing twist for idiots? sorry.
[0:47:42] <%krispen_wa> The "Hole in the Force" was kind of a twist
[0:47:43] <memejima> ‚ÄúIt was you Fann, IT WAS ALWAYS YOU‚Äù
[0:47:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> You smelt like the bitch
[0:47:45] <%SmoothEnigma> FANI TWISTED EVERYONE ELSE
[0:47:46] <%NopeBadguy> @Joestar1890 Yes.
[0:47:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> so she knows she'll fail
[0:47:51] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> Ultimately, Culture/History/Traditions/etc are just Peer Pressure From Dead People. Fuck Em, as Suda 51 says "Kill The Past"
[0:47:52] <%kyh9> Shout out to Luke
[0:47:54] <%quinnage7> @WoolieVersus This game is what The Last Jedi wishes it was
[0:47:54] <Matt169000> Don‚Äôt get it twisted
[0:48:05] <%NopeBadguy> @Joestar1890 IIRC, in Dark Side, she's the one who leaves the holomessage in T3.
[0:48:09] <%heartlesshealer> The Only One
[0:48:22] <%krispen_wa> AWWW Granny
[0:48:24] <%heartlesshealer> In all of time
[0:48:25] <dinnydanny777> Are the rest of the party dead
[0:48:29] <+ShortOnTim> The twist they all thought they got with Rey was here all along, you‚Äôre nobody
[0:48:29] <memejima> You just straight up ripped yourself out of the Force
[0:48:33] <Bruno_Tropical> @HieronymusZephyrinus but they arent tho. They are stories. Stories are the greatest invention of humanity
[0:48:37] <dinnydanny777> I just realised we haven't seen them in ages
[0:48:37] <+Freeborg23> @dinnydanny777 No
[0:48:38] <Camail> messiest break up EVER
[0:48:40] <Halospaz117> @dinnydanny777 Nah they got rescued, except for Atton who escaped on his own
[0:48:43] <therakishsage> GRAN GRAN WHY ARE YOU SO GREAT
[0:48:44] <Doodle_Taco> "FUCK THIS"

[0:48:45] <%kyh9> LUKE
[0:48:46] <Joestar1890> @NopeBadguy I always thought she died after that holomessage, like during the great Sith in-fight
[0:48:47] <%Gruhunchously> LUKE
[0:48:48] <+Freeborg23> @dinnydanny777 We freed them earlier
[0:48:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> KYLE KATARN
[0:48:50] <%Jetzord> Luke
[0:48:50] <megamirk> Kyle Katarn
[0:48:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> KYLE LOSES THE FORCE
[0:48:52] <bbblaketwitching> I think granny wants to feel Pakk's "truth"
[0:48:53] <%GrassCannon> KYYYLE
[0:48:54] <prime_name> SHADOW COUNTER
[0:48:55] <memejima> The Force is a tapestry, and you were a thread that TORE yourself out leaving a hole
[0:48:55] <%kyh9> TLJ Luke?
[0:48:55] <a_mad_dragon> he didn't just rip the force out of himself, he threw it on the ground and shot it
[0:48:57] <subjectg> @samura1_queen19 in a sense, she‚Äôs presenting herself as the final test, she would rather you succeed, but gotta fight for it
[0:48:58] <+maenos2> Kyle Katarn to a T
[0:48:59] <McCune> Fallen order
[0:48:59] <+Freeborg23> @dinnydanny777 Kreia had them imprisoned
[0:49:00] <VJdarkworld> Bigger Luke v. Smaller Luke
[0:49:00] <dinnydanny777> Kyle does lose the force but he gets it back
[0:49:01] <%optimasmaximas> block LUL
[0:49:01] <%NopeBadguy> It's like a rejection of power so hard that you lose like a limb in the process, that much of a wound.
[0:49:03] <Camail> move out of country
[0:49:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> New phone who dis
[0:49:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> Jedi have closed the door. Fanny destroyed the door and put up a brick wall
[0:49:05] <+bokutachi_san> clear your cache
[0:49:08] <%DatAsuna> Well Ulic didn't, but he lost his in different circumstances.
[0:49:11] <dinnydanny777> Kyle Katarn loses it but he gets it back from a source
[0:49:12] <memejima> @kyh9 Luke still had connections, but just turned away from em
[0:49:16] <%VCRUZZO> the force was literaly butthurt that the Exile was like nah bitch
[0:49:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @VJdarkworld Bigger Luke is the true evil force
[0:49:19] <AllTheZibas> Are you sure you want to block: The Force?
[0:49:20] <aiutare47> Spit in gods face so hard he takes it personally
[0:49:25] <%tuesti> willing to lose something ingrained in you
[0:49:25] <$Invlux> Pack your bags and move away
[0:49:28] <%krispen_wa> Kyle lost the force, but Fann KILLED the force inside him
[0:49:33] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @bruno_tropical Nah, Music I'd say is. Besides, sometimes you just gotta press on forward, never looking back.
[0:49:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Kreia would LOVE Edward Elric. And also hate him.
[0:49:37] <silverira> he deleted his facebook profile
[0:49:46] <bbblaketwitching> I agree with thay
[0:49:47] <%VCRUZZO> But did you?
[0:49:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @hieronymuszephyrinus Peer pressure from dead people isn't even the important thing. We're talking about whether or not death is a happy forever vacation with everyone else or absolute oblivion.
[0:49:51] <therakishsage> Notice how she speaks how there are going to be jedi in the future. She knows that she isn't going to 'win' here. Perhaps she's never really wanted to.
[0:49:51] <furcifer93> Like Kyle Katarn and Luke
[0:49:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> would the Exile be a Pariah in 40k terms
[0:49:53] <dinnydanny777> Should have been a gunman

[0:50:13] <dinnydanny777> How does this conversation go if you aren't a Jedi

[0:50:22] <Bruno_Tropical> @HieronymusZephyrinus impossible, we are what came before. The past is always now, time and histpry are just ways of making sense of it, but the past never dies. It is always present.
[0:50:24] <%BinaryFireball> just bone instead
[0:50:30] <%NopeBadguy> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE.
[0:50:31] <silverira> WoolieVS The Force
[0:50:35] <dinnydanny777> Isn't that Rule of Two?
[0:50:35] <+PlagueOfGripes> this is where her logic starts falling apart because video game
[0:50:36] <+Freeborg23> @dinnydanny777 You throw Kreia into the pit below to fuel Malachor
[0:50:39] <Parapattern> Can't we just hang?
[0:50:45] <%VCRUZZO> @dinnydanny777 the same essentially
[0:50:49] <bbblaketwitching> I find that odd? How does that work with force bonds?
[0:50:50] <zeow31> @dinnydanny777 She kinda shit on you in the most passive agressive manner
[0:50:54] <%spiritofmojave> weird how she's still going off Sith structure when she's been arguing how fundamentally busted it is
[0:50:54] <%krispen_wa> What's up with everyone wanting to BREAK you
[0:50:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> SAY THAT
[0:50:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> SAY ITS NOT TOO LATE
[0:51:00] <subjectg> @therakishsage it‚Äôs great that no matter the outcome here, she gets what she wants, either the death of the force or a new improved jedi order
[0:51:00] <%krispen_wa> DO the I SAVE YOU
[0:51:01] <samura1_queen19> @subjectg even if that‚Äôs the case like how long has she been planning all this? Like was she waiting to control the exile since his birth or what?
[0:51:02] <dinnydanny777> That's actually kind of dumb haha
[0:51:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Rule of 2 doesn't exist yet
[0:51:04] <bbblaketwitching> Shouldn't they both die if either do?

[0:51:25] <%NopeBadguy> Kreia is not so unreasonable that she doesn't have good in her, but she's fully committed to this path.
[0:51:30] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @generalscpatton does it matter, ultimately? they're dead, they had their time. And if you cease to be, whatever, just gotta enjoy the time you have now.
[0:51:33] <derap41> No Naruto it Woolie
[0:51:34] <dinnydanny777> She's like a hundred to be fair

[0:52:03] <Joestar1890> Considering it's Star Wars, where Darth "Personal Jedi Genocider" Vader can be saved, then anyone can be saved
[0:52:05] <mattynezz> Kreia fucking HATES redemption
[0:52:07] <bbblaketwitching> I love her more now
[0:52:08] <dinnydanny777> Very edgy line

[0:52:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas the one that lets you see like Visas and Kreia. see people's force allignment

[0:52:31] <samura1_queen19> Edges grandma üëµüèæ
[0:52:37] <RamenRiderZ> That's nice but I just can't get this BATTLE BONEE DOWN
[0:52:47] <samura1_queen19> Edgey grandma üëµüèæ
[0:52:50] <vaderxyz1970> When the race war starts but you have to kill Tony hawk
[0:52:53] <%Ashenik1> So she wants to destroy the force by using fanny?
[0:52:58] <%krispen_wa> If she kills you, the echo destroys the force
[0:52:59] <Joestar1890> LUL
[0:53:03] <bbblaketwitching> amazing
[0:53:06] <%DSD24> Kill Palpatine with TWO lightsabers
[0:53:09] <%M3djedx> I used the force to destroy the force
[0:53:11] <memejima> ‚ÄúI die, you die. You die, I die‚Äù
[0:53:12] <dinnydanny777> Well you continue to leech the force from everyone right?
[0:53:13] <phatmac16> I AM ALL THE JEDI
[0:53:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shoot the gun peacefully
[0:53:17] <Hammatime8> Grandma out here like: üñï tomatoCult
[0:53:18] <memejima> Either way you DIE
[0:53:19] <+MrProw> I wish we'd all forget sequels happened.
[0:53:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @krispen_wa the fanny must create echoes
[0:53:19] <ingman112> If she beats you, it might destroy the force. If you win, you‚Äôve become her greatest triumph
[0:53:21] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur idk half of what you referred to, will i understand when i go back and watch the yt vids when i wanna catch up?
[0:53:22] <%spiritofmojave> Kill Palpatine but compliment him on his moisturizing routine
[0:53:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> in other words the fanny must clap
[0:53:25] <dinnydanny777> You basically go away and drain the force of the galaxy
[0:53:28] <derap41> Do you think those things hurt the ears after a couple hours?
[0:53:33] <Bruno_Tropical> @HieronymusZephyrinus To try whould only make things worse. If you want to move forward so much, why do you insist in reducing all to zero? We must build on what we have, repair what is broken. That is the true way forward. WHat you suggest is regression, not progress
[0:53:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> FANNY. CLAPPING. TWERKA. IT ALL COMES FULL CIRCLE
[0:53:36] <+MidnightBurst12> to be fair, motivation is important
[0:53:38] <Unlimitedbadgers> just infect palpatine with corona
[0:53:49] <bbblaketwitching> really tho, shouldn't they both die if either do?
[0:53:55] <%tuesti> yeeee
[0:53:57] <%krispen_wa> Was Kreia here for the Battle of Malachor>
[0:53:59] <dinnydanny777> It's like Poetry
[0:54:01] <Halospaz117> I think it's Sion, Nihlus, AND The exile all at once
[0:54:03] <Archmortal> being held together by a FORCE you might say
[0:54:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas yes Visas gives you the ability to see characters' force allignment
[0:54:08] <samura1_queen19> This game kinda makes more sense than the rise of skywalker
[0:54:12] <bbblaketwitching> isn't that completely contrary to what granny wants?
[0:54:15] <zeow31> @bbblaketwitching nope, she lied about that
[0:54:19] <bbblaketwitching> ah
[0:54:22] <bbblaketwitching> ty

[0:55:26] <Dangerzone979> I forget does she get the trifecta attack in this game?
[0:55:26] <$Invlux> this is just that scene from Overlord
[0:55:27] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur and does the alignment vary? you mentioned her's wasnt completely red, so does that mean it's a less darker/less bright red? like how evil/good a person is the darker or lighter the color?
[0:55:27] <GHouseduivel> Punish me Exile

[0:55:29] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @bruno_tropical because in this case, we honestly can't. everyone dances to the tune of some all powerful unknowable God that controls everyone. you can't truly do anything in this case. you need to start over to actually do stuff instead of doing what this God is manipulating you to do.

[1:00:18] <%kyh9> BUT DONT THO
[1:00:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas like when you help people and she gets mad saying "now they wont learn and grow from the experience." Even if you know, if you didnt help them they'd just fucking die and would never have an opportunity to learn or grow again
[1:00:21] <JohnAtDawn> Just walk around
[1:00:22] <+armor_kuma> Just lightning

[1:00:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas she hates pure altruism but also pointless chaotic evil dickery. She wants you to work in your own self-interest

[1:01:14] <+cvp5127> kick the handle
[1:01:18] <subjectg> So because of level scaling and because boss battles, kreia has 60 WILL here. SIXTY
[1:01:18] <Halospaz117> You just kicked a fucking lightsaber
[1:01:18] <huskarl_zap> KICK THE LIGHTSABER PogChamp
[1:01:18] <KaitlynnHere> V.A wise
[1:01:18] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur She praise you if you help people but push them to help others in return.... As long as you convert the people you help to your point of view she loves it
[1:01:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> I always just spmmed Force Wave here to stun the sabers
[1:01:20] <Joostebrood> you can just use the game's shitty pathfinding to get rid of the lightsabers
[1:01:20] <Lee_The_Limey> Use the cheese , Fann'y Kappa
[1:01:20] <dinnydanny777> Fann just kicked
[1:01:24] <+RJay80> getting ganked by lightsabers

[1:01:46] <%M3djedx> Gotta kite the sabers
[1:01:49] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur okay so she isnt chaotic "all things must die" evil, she has an actual philosohpy?
[1:01:50] <Badgerconda_> Woolie is flustered because he's cakewalked through every fight in the game until now LUL
[1:01:52] <%VCRUZZO> @optimasmaximas I gotcha there is some missing context for you for how we got here so it would be quite confusing
[1:01:53] <%jaytitan96> Lightsaber gang initiation
[1:02:01] <subjectg> also this fight gets a little silly as a gun jedi
[1:02:02] <%NopeBadguy> You almost certainly have to go for the source as a mage. A Weaponmaster can go through em pretty easy.
[1:02:02] <bbblaketwitching> game over man, game over!
[1:02:06] <Lee_The_Limey> What a heroic , drug-fueled battled
[1:02:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas i mean she's still a hypocrite and her views are sort of stupid and full of shit but yeah i guess
[1:02:11] <+armor_kuma> You cakewalked the wholegame with lightning, Kreia was right LUL
[1:02:14] <dinnydanny777> Why can't Fann do this

[1:02:37] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia wants you to say no to drugs
[1:02:45] <+Freeborg23> For me, it was much easier fighting the lightsabers then kreia.
[1:02:46] <%tarnash12> fun trick. You can run away, have them chase you behind the pillers, then line of sight them so you drop combat. Theyll be stuck behind the pillars.
[1:02:46] <%krispen_wa> JUST NIGURUNDAYO
[1:02:49] <%heartlesshealer> she's so powerful
[1:02:50] <308caliber> monkaS this is fucking tense
[1:02:51] <%spiritofmojave> This seriously is the first fight he hasn't been able to just coast throigh, it's great
[1:02:54] <subjectg> this is why 3.5 is the good shit

[1:03:24] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus Now enjoy as Kreia reads you the rest of the script because they couldn't give you a proper ending LUL
[1:03:26] <dinnydanny777> Was Kreia carrying all these lightsabers somehow

[1:03:27] <vigilant00> Kreia: Thank god it is over.
[1:03:31] <BurdRightsActivist> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[1:03:32] <%jase__x> how about no
[1:03:33] <%Irridium> Alternatively you could just mine the SHIT out of that bridge and lead them into it

[1:03:47] <thealientrilogy> The greatest she's evre trained, more than REVAN.

[1:06:15] <%SmoothEnigma> SWOTOR is gr8, y'all are just haters
[1:06:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas Well i DO believe that she's actually Handmaiden's mom but that is a widely reviled crack theory that is 100% confirmed to be unintended by the writers, but they concede that the way they wrote things makes it very possible, logically speaking
[1:06:16] <+jiggy_snipe> even in HK? :D
[1:06:17] <GHouseduivel> The Jedi we made along the way
[1:06:18] <%MrMoonGoose> SWTOR is really fun
[1:06:18] <%NopeBadguy> The Real Lost Jedi were the friends you made along the way
[1:06:20] <%lotharrio> Congrats, you refounded the Jedi Order!

[1:06:25] <%heartlesshealer> Exile created new jedi
[1:06:27] <+rosabellamelantha> especially since swtor spends half of that games plot SHITTING on this game super hard
[1:06:28] <%2hutown> swtor is fine.
[1:06:32] <mattynezz> The Jedi that survive into the future, ARE FOUNDED BY THE PARTY
[1:06:39] <%Gruhunchously> True father?
[1:06:41] <IcyTvTuber> well time to close the chat cause all the wanton hate of swtor
[1:06:42] <%krispen_wa> TRUE FATHER?
[1:06:50] <arkv01> kreia, I... TearGlove
[1:06:50] <vigilant00> Yey SWTOR
[1:06:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @rosabellamelantha how exactly does SWTOR shit on this game? I dont doubt it does becasue Bioware is jealous but i dont kno specifics
[1:06:56] <Doodle_Taco> YEYEYEYE SHE DIES
[1:06:57] <olaksi> The true Jedi were the friends we made along the way
[1:06:59] <snakemuho> F

[1:07:07] <huskarl_zap> no regerts
[1:07:10] <+Purple_badger3000> You can hear how Kreia resents her for saving people
[1:07:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> The True Sith Lords were the friends we made along the day
[1:07:13] <Lee_The_Limey> "I leave to you my bowl of boiled sweets and the plastic-swapped couch "
[1:07:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> way***
[1:07:15] <thealientrilogy> SWTOR deserves the hate when it comes to anything concerning the legacy of KOTOR.
[1:07:17] <%NopeBadguy> "I have the rest of the script" @WoolieVersus
[1:07:18] <prince_johnny_> Lool
[1:07:19] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur the "Bioware is jealous" shit is pretty hyperbolic
[1:07:19] <Firststrike_OW> Its a great way around it LUL
[1:07:20] <mattynezz> TOR makes Revan a little bitch that was brainwashed
[1:07:20] <Psyramics> That's what happens to people. They all die eventually
[1:07:23] <%Jpshum> LUL
[1:07:25] <GHouseduivel> What happens to the stock market Kreia
[1:07:27] <%lotharrio> 14 months, shut up Fann.

[1:07:37] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur or jsut people shitting on it who haven't played it
[1:07:41] <sexdrugsvideogames> should have given her more talking animations tho...
[1:07:41] <%MrMoonGoose> I'm guessing the ppl who hate SWTOR are the same crowd who hate Korra. Reactionaries who never watched the later past the 1st season (if at all,) and never played the former.
[1:07:45] <Badgerconda_> This is actually better than the text ending screens, tbh
[1:07:45] <308caliber> for Mandalore! SwiftRage
[1:07:46] <%SmoothEnigma> Revan IS a little bitch who got brainwashed but he's also a cool badass

[1:08:59] <+tealplague> F
[1:08:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> but then the universe will be bought out and all that will be ignored because it's cool though
[1:09:02] <+rosabellamelantha> @LiquidDinosaur there's too many to get into just here but an example is Kreia is a sith force ghost for some reason despite hating the force. Also the exile is a revan fangirl who dies offscreen in a second just to jerk revan off more
[1:09:02] <+oda_flobunaga> Sarlacc *wink*
[1:09:05] <Joestar1890> Kriea didn't know about THE WAY
[1:09:09] <uncledoodsauce> spoilers for all the movies chat
[1:09:13] <%SouLucha> Disney denys Kreia, Kreia ignores Disney.
[1:09:21] <CodeSodaboi> SWTOR is good. Imperial Agent and Eternal Throne follow the themes of this game well.
[1:09:24] <$StaceMcGate> NO LOVE, ONLY FORCE
[1:09:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Youll see
[1:09:33] <%sunriser101> swotor story is good, gameplay is crap
[1:09:34] <huskarl_zap> yeah love, one convo
[1:09:35] <%lotharrio> Don't stick your dick in her!
[1:09:38] <vigilant00> @WoolieVersus Closure.
[1:09:38] <%M3djedx> Swror is trash
[1:09:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> @rosabellamelantha i mean Kreia as a ghost could be cool IF its presented as a ironic hell. but if not then lol fuck that
[1:09:42] <dinnydanny777> Katarr sounds like Catarr
[1:09:44] <JohnAtDawn> Yeah. Duh
[1:09:47] <+dumbgamerboy> @CodeSodaboi bait
[1:09:49] <R3c0n31> She aint the last
[1:09:49] <zeow31> @codesodaboi Agent sure. Imperial throne ? Hell no
[1:09:51] <CursedNobleman> Kyle Katarr
[1:09:54] <%MrMoonGoose> @rosabellamelantha that isn't Kreia, dude. Confirmed. It's just a female sith
[1:09:56] <%heartlesshealer> Settlers of Katarr
[1:10:04] <+Nothing_Wild> They could fix SWTOR if they retconned Revan and the Exile‚Äôs fate.
[1:10:12] <huskarl_zap> settlers of k,tar
[1:10:14] <+rosabellamelantha> @LiquidDinosaur it's not presented as irony it's just there because SWTOR loves shitting on kotor 2
[1:10:17] <phatmac16> Kriea still doesn't want the exile to fuck
[1:10:17] <%DatAsuna> Swtor is good, just don't go into it wanting it to be all about revan and the exile
[1:10:19] <+Nothing_Wild> The Exile just got thrown away like trash.
[1:10:20] <Camail> before most things
[1:10:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> what's Revan's fate in SWTOR
[1:10:22] <+metamyriad> Is there any more fitting conclusion for this game than Kreia fighting you with her mind and then having a long conversation with you where she shit-talks people across space and time?
[1:10:22] <%GrassCannon> BAO - Before all others
[1:10:25] <%VCRUZZO> @Nothing_Wild too deep in, they ain't gonna WOW it
[1:10:28] <%SmoothEnigma> swotor haters only exist cause they're salty the game isnt the same format as the first 2 games micDab
[1:10:29] <+dumbgamerboy> My favorite is how you fight HK as a raid boss for sick loot
[1:10:32] <%DatAsuna> Lowkey if you changed swtor to revolve around them you'd ruin the good parts of it
[1:10:34] <dinnydanny777> I miss Bao Dur
[1:10:35] <theredfox930000> little v will be a bones next time

[1:10:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @rosabellamelantha yeah on Castle Superbeast Pat said that Bioware treats kotor 2 like Bethesda treats New Vegas. Varying between ignoring it and ruining it

[1:11:07] <+logoth_> More where that came from
[1:11:08] <+oda_flobunaga> None Punch Girl
[1:11:09] <prime_name> I hate the troupe of "Cool warrior woman hangs it up to settle down" so much
[1:11:09] <Badgerconda_> a hot librarian though!
[1:11:10] <%orcstr16> Well she did restart the jedi order. I guess thats cool too. Eh
[1:11:11] <%Gruhunchously> Don't tell me that a Punch Librarian isn't cool
[1:11:11] <mrkatmonarchy> Atton will still play pazaak in his head
[1:11:11] <Parapattern> What about him?
[1:11:12] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur And that's putting it nicely
[1:11:13] <bbblaketwitching> oh god videl

[1:11:14] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur the thing is PAt uh, hasn't actually played SWOTOR
[1:11:14] <%lotharrio> Librarian Punch-Girl you say?
[1:11:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is not pleased
[1:11:18] <+Aeoneth> She's a Librarian that'll kick your ass 3 ways from Sunday
[1:11:19] <Amardeux> so Atton is Jar Jar?
[1:11:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> But as a librarian, she wears the sexy glasses like Bayo
[1:11:22] <dinnydanny777> Why does Kreia hate Atton so much
[1:11:23] <Camail> she cant tell LUL
[1:11:24] <e3a4> Handmaiden is like Yoko from TTGL
[1:11:24] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:24] <+jiggy_snipe> hmmmmm
[1:11:25] <watts121> She didn't even see anything...she's like "Atton doesn't matter"
[1:11:26] <+rosabellamelantha> SWTOR haters exist because SWTOR exists and is bad, not because we never played it or because it plays differently, I don't give a shit how the game plays since I played these games for the STORY

[1:12:33] <%optimasmaximas> wait does she actually love the player character or just paternally?
[1:12:34] <+Nothing_Wild> Drew Karpyshyn decided that they didn‚Äôt care for this game.
[1:12:34] <bbblaketwitching> Kreia skin coming to Yand sim when?
[1:12:35] <dinnydanny777> Oh ffe
[1:12:36] <RamenRiderZ> Youre the best grandson granny could have
[1:12:36] <T_Sasquatch> DARTH SIMPOUS
[1:12:36] <Jmann9218> Sion learned Simping from Kreia
[1:12:37] <prince_johnny_> God dammit
[1:12:38] <dinnydanny777> Oh ffs Kreia
[1:12:39] <%Ashenik1> .....
[1:12:40] <Badgerconda_> SEQUEL BAAAAAIT
[1:12:41] <+therabbles> Darth T3's final plan
[1:12:43] <+Nothing_Wild> At least, with that book.
[1:12:45] <+Takuatt> Rip
[1:12:45] <dinnydanny777> Kreia just tell us
[1:12:47] <+maenos2> "You must go into the unknown regions and be done dirty"
[1:12:50] <$StaceMcGate> Spoiler: T-3 dies in the novel. Emperor blows him up
[1:12:51] <huskarl_zap> DARTH T3
[1:12:51] <Joestar1890> BIG sequel bait
[1:12:55] <%M3djedx> That‚Äôs so metal
[1:12:56] <%gatorafan> Darth T3 makes his MOVE NOW
[1:12:56] <+rosabellamelantha> @LiquidDinosaur No pat is actually right about this one thing, SWTOR defenders are just out in full force because they have that MMO "I invested so much time in already"
[1:12:58] <dinnydanny777> She said nothing about Bao
[1:13:00] <%spiritofmojave> How about Remote though :) - Kreia
[1:13:04] <R3c0n31> He has vanished
[1:13:07] <Camail> makes sense she doesnt know, tho
[1:13:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bao (nothing)
[1:13:07] <+therabbles> Bao the mysterious stranger
[1:13:07] <ralphfromdk> Oh wait.. no... he ded...
[1:13:08] <%Gruhunchously> I got nothing
[1:13:08] <%Space_Pagan> Wow, can't wait for KOTOR 3! That great war sounds very interesting!
[1:13:08] <dinnydanny777> I miss Bao Dur
[1:13:09] <+metamyriad> She also couldn't read his mind, remember?
[1:13:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> its gone
[1:13:11] <RamenRiderZ> "I dunno, dead in a ditch"
[1:13:13] <+Nothing_Wild> Oh man, hate this part. A sequel hook that‚Äôll never get followed up on.
[1:13:14] <%Takreth> She also can't feel him though
[1:13:14] <%heartlesshealer> She can't sense BAo anyway
[1:13:16] <%VCRUZZO> ...
[1:13:17] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 We all do, buddy
[1:13:17] <%spiritofmojave> Yes I remember
[1:13:18] <megamirk> a fucking mmo
[1:13:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @maenos2 just like Sun Tzu's first law of war: Do em dirty in front of they dad
[1:13:18] <%Irridium> buffer stack overflow
[1:13:21] <megamirk> that's how it ends
[1:13:22] <montgomerynw> SWTOR does shit on KOTOR 2 but at the same time, the game is fine.
[1:13:23] <+MagicBeanBurrito> like a fart on the wind he's gone
[1:13:24] <bbblaketwitching> Not even a corpse, nothing
[1:13:25] <dinnydanny777> There was a Bao Dur here but it's gone now
[1:13:26] <%spiritofmojave> I also remember Bao DISAPPEARING
[1:13:26] <%SmoothEnigma> Takes an emperor to kill Darth T3, only way my boy should go out
[1:13:30] <%Gruhunchously> Sequel Bait
[1:13:32] <%SouLucha> Beo Dur.exe is missing!
[1:13:33] <mattynezz> HK at least survives forever
[1:13:33] <Nekros4442> It's pointing at SWTOR
[1:13:35] <R3c0n31> pointing at the Wrestemania sign
[1:13:36] <thealientrilogy> SWTOR's good at most everything- that has NOTHING to do with KOTOR.
[1:13:37] <usurper_sos> It was bait
[1:13:38] <+oda_flobunaga> Yuuzhong Vong
[1:13:39] <phatmac16> SWTOR!!!
[1:13:40] <+aishman> You learn it in SWTOR
[1:13:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> Isnt Bao-Dur dead?
[1:13:41] <Badgerconda_> Pointing at the Wrestlemania Sign
[1:13:44] <+dumbgamerboy> Bao dur was meant to die originally so they had nothing planned to put here for him
[1:13:44] <%krispen_wa> Pointing at a shitty MMO
[1:13:45] <prince_johnny_> Swtor
[1:13:46] <ht109> swtor but not really
[1:13:46] <subjectg> @nothing_wild real shame there was never a followup, like a game or a book or something Kappa
[1:13:48] <%Gruhunchously> There was going to be a KOTOR 3, yes.
[1:13:49] <+aishman> SEQUEL HOOKS INTO SWTOR
[1:13:50] <phatmac16> POINTING TO SWTOR
[1:13:51] <%heartlesshealer> Hmmmmmmmm
[1:13:53] <prime_name> Or like...Book Hooks?
[1:13:54] <Nekros4442> It's literally pointing at SWTOR
[1:13:54] <mattynezz> Never AS INTENDED, but TOR is a version of it
[1:13:54] <Joestar1890> It's pointing out to the cancelled KOTOR 3
[1:13:55] <Bruno_Tropical> Maybe someone w;ill make KOTOR 3, anything is poassible after all
[1:13:56] <zeow31> @montgomerynw The writing with the emperor is awful tho... That and it turns revan into a mind controlled punk
[1:13:56] <%brachydios777> SWTOR
[1:13:57] <e3a4> Bao Dur was in your head the whole time, thats why Kreia couldnt read him. You force projected him into reality
[1:13:59] <+MidnightBurst12> Ya don't say?
[1:14:02] <+Overlordkain> just watch the swotor intro
[1:14:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> that's the WHOLE plot of swotor
[1:14:04] <%spiritofmojave> SWTOR kinda is a 3 in some ways
[1:14:09] <Doodle_Taco> Fuck SWTOR
[1:14:10] <mattynezz> Obsidian didn't make it though, so it doesn't count
[1:14:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> they wanted to start a whole new book series off fo that game I guess
[1:14:11] <+Nothing_Wild> @subjectg That book sucked ass.
[1:14:12] <Gallhint> sadness...
[1:14:12] <subjectg> I think Obsidian did talk about their plans for a KOTOR 3
[1:14:17] <dinnydanny777> Is Bao in SWTOR?
[1:14:17] <%krispen_wa> KOTOR III would have been sick if the Sith were like how Avellone saw them as
[1:14:21] <Archmortal> You will never convince me SWTOR is what was intended in this epilogue, fuck that
[1:14:22] <%VCRUZZO> *sigh* swtor
[1:14:25] <%sunriser101> i realy with they would just take the plot of swotor and put a good game in
[1:14:26] <%Irridium> well, it was probably referencing a kotor 3 but yeah, SWOTOR happened instead. woo.
[1:14:29] <montgomerynw> SWTOR is 300 years after KOTOR 2
[1:14:32] <%VCRUZZO> @dinnydanny777 you can dream
[1:14:35] <%M3djedx> Forever sad we will never get another game like this
[1:14:38] <%DatAsuna> @PlagueOfGripes I'd diagree since like 5/8 of the swtor class tories aren't even about the war
[1:14:40] <%Space_Pagan> SWTOR is an o. k. game. But it sure as hell is not KOTOR 3 to me
[1:14:44] <subjectg> @nothing_wild don‚Äôt i know it
[1:14:44] <%brachydios777> Is swtor that bad?
[1:14:45] <+maenos2> @dinnydanny777 the game takes place a few hundred years later, safe bet no
[1:14:46] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO wait does she actually love the player character or just paternally?
[1:14:48] <arkv01> I close my eyes as swtor comes onto the stage
[1:14:48] <Joestar1890> @subjectg They did, or at least Chris Avellone made a outline of what he wanted to do
[1:14:52] <+dumbgamerboy> swtor wasn't even an idea at this point
[1:14:56] <bbblaketwitching> the way she said that
[1:14:56] <308caliber> the real fight is still to come
[1:14:58] <%DatAsuna> Swtor isn't bad
[1:14:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Bruno_Tropical
[1:15:00] <%lotharrio> It was totally the setup for KotOR3. It just got repurposed for the MMO
[1:15:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> RESTORED ONLY CONTENT
[1:15:05] <%DatAsuna> It is very divisive
[1:15:06] <mattynezz> SWTOR is pretty bad
[1:15:06] <zeow31> @brachydios777 Boring mmo and awful writing plot wise
[1:15:06] <%DSD24> The Reapers are out there
[1:15:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait are the true sith Extragalactic?
[1:15:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BTELW
[1:15:11] <+dumbgamerboy> @lotharrio correct
[1:15:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BTW
[1:15:12] <%DatAsuna> And the book is real bad
[1:15:14] <%Sedrelic> and sometimes lizards
[1:15:16] <Camail> revan is so fucking cool
[1:15:17] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur no
[1:15:22] <%VCRUZZO> @optimasmaximas not romatically, no
[1:15:29] <%sunriser101> siths are a belief, also red aliens with tentacles
[1:15:33] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> No money
[1:15:35] <%BinaryFireball> So she wento to go fight Dio?
[1:15:37] <olaksi> SWTOR was made by Bioware, it had no chance of living up to this
[1:15:39] <%DatAsuna> Close your damn mouth, Fann.
[1:15:42] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur the true sith, in swotor, are jsut the Sith Empire in hiding
[1:15:49] <%Coo_coo1> Force No U didn't
[1:15:50] <%Gruhunchously> You saw nothing
[1:15:52] <Halospaz117> "I figured it out!" "No you didn't"
[1:15:52] <+Ixek> Oh, got here for the very end. Welp.
[1:15:53] <%DSD24> "Welcome to Earth"
[1:15:53] <Joysta> galaxy defended
[1:15:54] <Bruno_Tropical> Time to go after the real villains
[1:15:55] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur they're jsut in the outer regions being sneaky
[1:15:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> i mean....SWTOR sounds bad but that sound sound too bad? I mean it sounds logical
[1:16:03] <Joestar1890> Darth Pockets loves people other than money? unbelievable.
[1:16:03] <Bruno_Tropical> Time to play the mmo
[1:16:12] <BliVru> @WoolieVersus Wait how did Revan got to the Fringes without a ship?
[1:16:12] <bbblaketwitching> lame as dark jedi
[1:16:13] <%optimasmaximas> @sunriser101 you talkin about the red twilek?
[1:16:15] <Halospaz117> They're "Sith"
[1:16:15] <%DatAsuna> @LiquidDinosaur It's better than kotor 2 but worse than kotor 2
[1:16:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @LiquidDinosaur Don't forget there's a video game behind it and the video game isn't great.
[1:16:16] <%RevolverBobkat> We should end this series with SWTOR cinematics
[1:16:16] <dinnydanny777> This is very like "Jedi in the movies can't love, here's why"
[1:16:16] <+Nothing_Wild> @branchydios777 It‚Äôs got okay parts. But like others said, it really disrespected the original games. Even BioWare‚Äôs own game.
[1:16:16] <%lotharrio> Dark Jedi
[1:16:18] <+CelebrityGhost> the "true sith" basically ends up being exactly the same as the emperor hiding in episode 9
[1:16:20] <%DatAsuna> *better than 1
[1:16:20] <+Reaviar> all the sith here were just posers
[1:16:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> Sith are not here. Yet
[1:16:20] <%MrMoonGoose> SWTOR is legit great, some ppl are just haters
[1:16:22] <ralphfromdk> Wanna be posers
[1:16:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tearfuldevil like if i hear "true sith empire" i would think "ok there's an empire of Actual Red Tentacle Beard Guys out there still"
[1:16:23] <GHouseduivel> This was the corrupted repbulic
[1:16:23] <a_mad_dragon> sith in name only
[1:16:23] <Badgerconda_> They're Sith Cosplayers
[1:16:24] <Camail> just fallen jedi
[1:16:25] <Joestar1890> All Dark Jedi
[1:16:27] <mrkatmonarchy> and for a reminder, not all the crew in the Ebon Hawk can see Kreia
[1:16:27] <%M3djedx> Yeah I can‚Äôt believe Pockets would leave anything behind
[1:16:27] <%Gruhunchously> Just some assholes with red lightsabers
[1:16:29] <+MidnightBurst12> Sith wannabes
[1:16:29] <$BallerSwagBro9k> These are Fallen Jedi
[1:16:29] <%DSD24> She had purple lightsabers
[1:16:30] <dinnydanny777> Fallen Jedi's
[1:16:31] <Joustar_> Morally grey sith
[1:16:31] <knotsundownsyndrome> SWTOR dark side is fine
[1:16:32] <+BubbaRands> Sith enthusiasts
[1:16:33] <%SouLucha> Sith is an ideal!
[1:16:33] <+dumbgamerboy> even as a free to play mmo, swtor isn't worth the time, read the wiki on it if you have to, the writing sucks in game
[1:16:36] <+PlagueOfGripes> well, Revan and Malak were debatably "sith" once you learn what happened to them
[1:16:36] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur they do have some red ebarded dudes
[1:16:38] <knotsundownsyndrome> SWTOR light side is not very good
[1:16:38] <mattynezz> Obsidian clearly intended the Sith Empire to basically be a bunch of Nihilus tier monsters, but lol WoW MMO, two teams
[1:16:43] <%jaytitan96> Yea everything in 1 AND 2 were just Good guys who got corrupted
[1:16:45] <afronooch> Real sith hours who up?/
[1:16:46] <+rosabellamelantha> @LiquidDinosaur the problem with SWTOR is more the execution and the bioware writers being salty about kotor 2 that's the problem, but if you say this you get written off as "a hater"
[1:16:47] <+maenos2> #notmysith
[1:16:48] <%sunriser101> light side sith warrior is pretty great
[1:16:48] <Badgerconda_> Space eldritch abominations
[1:16:50] <GHouseduivel> Outside the outer rim
[1:16:52] <%Gruhunchously> The guys truly responsible for the Mandalorian Wars
[1:16:55] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur there's still some Sith purebloods
[1:16:55] <%krispen_wa> True Sith would basically just be Reapers
[1:16:56] <dinnydanny777> These are basically just dickhead Jedi
[1:16:56] <samura1_queen19> So the Sith is a belief than a empire?
[1:16:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Real Sith were never Jedi to begin with
[1:16:57] <%tuesti> @mattynezz that's fucking sick
[1:17:01] <e3a4> Neo Sith
[1:17:02] <+rosabellamelantha> @LiquidDinosaur like the concept is fine
[1:17:02] <VJdarkworld> is true sith the palpatine clone zone? üòè
[1:17:04] <%BisoromiBear> hungry and crusty are secondaries
[1:17:04] <Jmann9218> Real Sith are born with an affinity for the dark side
[1:17:04] <subjectg> @blivru easy answer is revan used the ebon hawk to get there and had t3 send it back, this also explains why the navicomputer is locked
[1:17:05] <montgomerynw> Light Side Sith Warrior trolling the Jedi is fun as fuck
[1:17:05] <Joestar1890> You're not a REAL Sith!
[1:17:05] <knotsundownsyndrome> i spent a good few years on SWTOR and it's not really great
[1:17:05] <bbblaketwitching> I really wish the enemies names weren't "Sith X" to go along with this
[1:17:05] <%alrobot2014> they're Sith Secondaries
[1:17:06] <%lotharrio> "Fucking secondaries."
[1:17:10] <+Davos_Southway> @WoolieVersus Her saber is PURPLE
[1:17:12] <+Nothing_Wild> The Light Sith was kind of a cool development.
[1:17:12] <usurper_sos> You don't even KNOW
[1:17:16] <%Gruhunchously> Get on my level scrub
[1:17:16] <GHouseduivel> You can't even speak Sith
[1:17:21] <%gatorafan> @alrobot2014, Sithcondaries DansGame
[1:17:22] <%Ashenik1> I mean Nihillus was pretty fucking powerfull
[1:17:23] <%M3djedx> They‚Äôre more Sith than Kylo Ren
[1:17:23] <dinnydanny777> I've always thought the "Fallen Jedi' are Jedi who do dark things while the Sith are more like a religion
[1:17:24] <%Irridium> Oh you're the Sith? Name 3 of their albums
[1:17:24] <%SouLucha> "Sith Secondaries!" LUL LUL
[1:17:29] <%DatAsuna> Swtor at it's worst is not great, however it has tons of good stuff people ignore.
[1:17:30] <308caliber> the True Sith in the Outer Rims monkaS
[1:17:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tearfuldevil i can deal with being branded a hater. I mean, i still fly the fucking Kreia= Arran Kae flag despite everyone being sick of that bullshit
[1:17:33] <megamirk> "I don't even have a shower in my house"
[1:17:34] <+Billyfig1> git gud sith lords
[1:17:34] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SITH>>>>>>>>>>>>JEDI
[1:17:35] <Bruno_Tropical> So they are just Dark Paladins
[1:17:35] <BliVru> @subjectg ah right, but how did Kreia found the ship?
[1:17:35] <%Coo_coo1> Bruh you killed like what, 2 puppies, get the fuck out of my evil desolate planet
[1:17:36] <%spiritofmojave> he doesn't even speak sith LUL ... HISS ...
[1:17:37] <phatmac16> SECONDARIES
[1:17:39] <dinnydanny777> Like a fallen Jedi is a dark Jedi, the Sith are a cult
[1:17:39] <%sonofthedeepsouth> THE SITH EMPIRE
[1:17:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> Chris Avelone is wrong about his own game
[1:17:47] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NO
[1:17:48] <Joestar1890> @montgomerynw LS Sith: "I come in peace, Jedi" Jedi: "No you don't i'm gonna kill you!"
[1:17:49] <%VCRUZZO> @optimasmaximas its more of what you represent to her and in regards to the plot
[1:17:49] <zoopbooploop> BASEMENT KING SITH
[1:17:49] <huskarl_zap> in sith every word is the n word just like mordor
[1:17:51] <%DatAsuna> Yes
[1:17:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> yes
[1:17:52] <%gatorafan> :: Filthy Secondaries!!!! ::
[1:17:53] <%krispen_wa> Kiiinda
[1:17:54] <vigilant00> @Bruno_Tropical Dark Jedi
[1:17:54] <+MidnightBurst12> yes
[1:17:56] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur ??? what did i say about haters?
[1:17:57] <%sunriser101> so those siths are like the brown skin nazis that we have in latin america
[1:17:57] <+taMsaN> yes there's sith racism
[1:18:00] <+oda_flobunaga> NO
[1:18:03] <+dumbgamerboy> kreia being arren kae just improves the story and fills in some plot holes, its a very fun theory, true or not
[1:18:04] <%krispen_wa> The Hyperspace War
[1:18:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[1:18:07] <%heartlesshealer> signs point to maybe
[1:18:10] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Sith Empire was pretty cool
[1:18:11] <Jmann9218> The Great Hyperspace War
[1:18:11] <montgomerynw> Watch the SWTOR Timelines you don't have to play the game.
[1:18:12] <%Gruhunchously> The Great Hyperspace War
[1:18:13] <%SouLucha> I love how chat just answers, thanks chat.
[1:18:16] <+PlagueOfGripes> Even Momin, when he saw Vader and Palpatine, said they were not Sith
[1:18:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tearfuldevil fuck i @ the wrong guy
[1:18:20] <Bruno_Tropical> @vigilant00 that is what i meant. Jeid are asically paladins
[1:18:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus It was hinted in Kotor 1
[1:18:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> sorry
[1:18:21] <vigilant00> No we have heard hints of them in kotor 1 and 2
[1:18:22] <mattynezz> "They Genocided all Sith" becomes "They genocided most Sith, some ran away"
[1:18:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> and that's some Disney shit
[1:18:25] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @dumbgamerboy agreed

[1:18:40] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus The great Hyperspace War was in the 90s comics, pre prequels
[1:18:42] <dinnydanny777> So what about the Sith on Korriban in KOTOR1
[1:18:44] <vigilant00> @Bruno_Tropical ok stay calm
[1:18:54] <+Kduff89> but y tho
[1:18:56] <+dumbgamerboy> What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
[1:18:58] <+redhandedbee> I‚Äôm learning so much right now
[1:18:59] <Bruno_Tropical> @vigilant00 um, i am??
[1:19:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dinnydanny777 LARPers of the Revan/Malak branch
[1:19:00] <dinnydanny777> Were the Sith on Korriban in the Sith Temple real Sith?
[1:19:00] <%DSD24> Oh nooo
[1:19:00] <DavidDredd84> @DatAsuna Oh sick
[1:19:02] <subjectg> @blivru that part isn‚Äôt explained too well, unfortunately. But I believe the idea was that kreia was on the exile‚Äôs trail and found the harbringer first, then the ebon hawk came into the picture. Maybe, i forget
[1:19:03] <RamenRiderZ> Pockets hunting the real demons
[1:19:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> NOOOOOOOOO
[1:19:06] <%Gruhunchously> Wait, is she talking about Carth?

[1:19:25] <%Space_Pagan> Granny :(
[1:19:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fucking REJECTED
[1:19:25] <mattynezz> Pockets <3 Carth confirmed
[1:19:29] <LunarRemix> She needs MMO players
[1:19:32] <%alpacasintophats> coulda been cando
[1:19:33] <TransDoomGuy> Why is the wind louder than Kreia?
[1:19:34] <%DSD24> End of All Things
[1:19:34] <+maenos2> god with what kreia says and what happens...
[1:19:36] <%alpacasintophats> believe in the Cando
[1:19:38] <phatmac16> CARTH <3 REVAN
[1:19:40] <vigilant00> @dinnydanny777 They were not "true sith"
[1:19:42] <Airtighttrash> Sith in kotor 1 were just dark jedi
[1:19:42] <Joestar1890> Carth was always confirmed love interest for female Revan
[1:19:44] <%VCRUZZO> lol
[1:19:45] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus So if Revan was LS, you actually meet Carth after the Battle of Telos.
[1:19:45] <usurper_sos> this is The Way
[1:19:46] <OverlordLuna> He's right its a system we can't afford to lose.
[1:19:49] <%DSD24> Woolie its just the Reapers
[1:19:50] <%DatAsuna> I think the people who tout kotor 2 as being the best period forget how much of this game is shitty filler with the exchange and dantooine militia .etc
[1:19:51] <Joestar1890> Did people not know this?
[1:19:53] <%alpacasintophats> shush your face joestar
[1:19:54] <snakemuho> and then Bioware fucked up their own Reapers too LUL\
[1:19:54] <ralphfromdk> Oh this is totally just a reused plot point by Bioware :D
[1:19:56] <GHouseduivel> You exist because we allow it, you will end, because we demand it.
[1:19:57] <%Gruhunchously> Oh lawd they comin'
[1:19:58] <%spiritofmojave> waiting at the edge of space is pretty similar as a sequel hook
[1:19:59] <bbblaketwitching> somehow, I really don't think it's the end of all things with the way star wars works
[1:20:00] <+oda_flobunaga> The Dom Kavash on Freelancer
[1:20:01] <%VCRUZZO> I get that comparison, and he ain't off
[1:20:01] <huskarl_zap> psaBig PogChamp @ woolie
[1:20:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Welp....also made by BIOWARE LUL
[1:20:01] <%alpacasintophats> carth is a fuck
[1:20:02] <+dumbgamerboy> @OverlordLuna thanks
[1:20:06] <Archmortal> Despite the ME3 ending, it did the follow up to this concept of BAD SHIT COMING way the fuck better
[1:20:07] <%xcompleasedad> PLAY 2 AND 3
[1:20:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> KOTOR 3 NEVER BibleThump
[1:20:08] <%SouLucha> Oh geee, another EA/Bioware game...
[1:20:09] <Make_me_mad> Pointing at a barely visible wrestlemania sign outside the known galaxy.
[1:20:10] <+Davos_Southway> she was talking about cando not carth
[1:20:10] <Joustar_> The evil hiding in Dark Space huh. [totally not similar to this nope]
[1:20:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REAPERS
[1:20:12] <Robot_Nixon_> good thing you stopped there Kappa
[1:20:15] <+tearfuldevil> @DatAsuna i sure do love onderon
[1:20:17] <GHouseduivel> The Big ass soverign was a Reaper
[1:20:17] <usurper_sos> It's reapers
[1:20:17] <Badgerconda_> Kotor and Mass Effect are practically the same game, Woolie.
[1:20:18] <VJdarkworld> traya pointing to wrestlemania sign PogChamp
[1:20:21] <huskarl_zap> DO NOT PLAY 3
[1:20:21] <%alrobot2014> that was revealed by the tentacle ship himself
[1:20:24] <%DSD24> Mass Effect 2 was so good
[1:20:25] <derap41> yeah he the smallest shit of Reapers
[1:20:29] <%DSD24> Mordin is the best
[1:20:32] <%DatAsuna> @tearfuldevil I like dxun but the vaklu stuff sucks
[1:20:33] <%SouLucha> Kotor2=ME2
[1:20:33] <Joestar1890> @alpacasintophats Search your feelings, you KNOW it to be true!
[1:20:34] <%krispen_wa> And it takes A WHOLE FLEET to defeat one Reaper
[1:20:34] <XeroSigmaPrime> 3 was AMAZING! until the end
[1:20:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ME3 is good until the end
[1:20:36] <akman14> WRONG
[1:20:36] <%jaytitan96> KOTOR 3 would of had A, B, C
[1:20:36] <+maenos2> 3's decent up until the last 30 minutes
[1:20:36] <Nekros4442> 3 was fine until the last hour
[1:20:37] <knotsundownsyndrome> 3 is fine
[1:20:37] <JohnAtDawn> One guy
[1:20:38] <+aishman> 3 was a botch though man.
[1:20:38] <joylent_blue> 3 is fine
[1:20:38] <phatmac16> 3 is fine, the ending sucked
[1:20:39] <+logoth_> Nah he's right
[1:20:40] <startstoprepeat> me3's great except the start and the end
[1:20:42] <%DatAsuna> Ignore chat they're salty
[1:20:42] <derap41> Sovereign is the bitch boy of the Reaper is
[1:20:44] <+oda_flobunaga> 3 is great until the last 1.5 hours
[1:20:45] <+aishman> 3 is okay, but I couldn't finish it
[1:20:45] <mattynezz> 3 is better than 2, fight me
[1:20:46] <bbblaketwitching> I prefer 2.5
[1:20:46] <+gutlesscoward> it is NOT, sir
[1:20:47] <+therabbles> 3 is fine but isn't what i should have been
[1:20:47] <+armor_kuma> 3 was cool but fuck the ending
[1:20:48] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PJSalt Squid2 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid2 Squid4
[1:20:48] <%DSD24> 3 had great gameplay
[1:20:48] <Amardeux> 3 was fine, until the ending LUL
[1:20:49] <huskarl_zap> JACISE THIS WRONGNESS
[1:20:49] <%M3djedx> Never played any of them, should i?
[1:20:49] <%xcompleasedad> 3 is GREAT......... until the end
[1:20:49] <Joestar1890> 3 is good up until the ending
[1:20:50] <Joustar_> 3 was fixed to be fine at least
[1:20:50] <JohnAtDawn> That was a one guy call out
[1:20:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> 3 was fine, until the ending. ending dominated its reception
[1:20:53] <%Coo_coo1> Imagine seeing the Reaper swarm come into the milky way, but they all have giant red Lightsabers, 1 in each tentacle
[1:20:53] <GHouseduivel> It destroyed entire species fleets
[1:20:54] <%bread_assassin> Does anyone have any serious gripes with 3 besides the ending?
[1:20:54] <%Gruhunchously> @derap41 Still the most competent of all the Reapers
[1:20:54] <RedSqurrl> 3 is fine
[1:20:55] <+rosabellamelantha> 3 is **fine**
[1:20:56] <Memdosu> 3 is fine
[1:20:57] <+tearfuldevil> 3 is pretty fucking bad early on
[1:20:58] <%DSD24> The multiplayer was so good in 3
[1:20:59] <snakemuho> imagine ever stopping being mad about 3
[1:21:01] <%dead_harmony13> 3 was good until the last hour
[1:21:02] <%alpacasintophats> @Joestar1890 NO! I reject the lies of THE REPUBLIC! MANDALORE IS THE TRUTH!
[1:21:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> Children playing with toys
[1:21:03] <coracor> we live in a sithciety
[1:21:04] <R3c0n31> 3 is great, just that ending...
[1:21:04] <afronooch> 3 couldve been better but yeah its fine
[1:21:05] <+dumbgamerboy> 3 is fine. 3's ending is not fine.
[1:21:07] <%DatAsuna> 3 has problems besides the ending but is good overall
[1:21:09] <%kyh9> @dsd24 my man
[1:21:10] <+SolidusRex> 3 is not fine
[1:21:11] <+maenos2> @Coo_coo1 stop, i can only get so erect
[1:21:12] <CrypticMochi> 3 is cool, but fuck that climax
[1:21:13] <%SmoothEnigma> Mass Effect 3 is good just like SWOTOR is good. they have flaws but that dosent make them BAD ya doofs
[1:21:13] <%lotharrio> 3's multiplayer almost made the whole thing worth it.
[1:21:14] <arkv01> 3 is fuckin fine, look at andromeda
[1:21:14] <%krispen_wa> Remember how Harbinger was the first Reaper, but he was a total jobber
[1:21:18] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but we kicked those ghosts asses on Korriban
[1:21:18] <chromdad> 3 is ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùfine‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
[1:21:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Anyone still salty about the ME3 ending plz replay with the MEHEM Mod. fixes the endings
[1:21:21] <boostergoldz> what are you talking about ghost child is in the first 10 minutes of 3
[1:21:24] <huskarl_zap> it was was worset than all the others even before the end
[1:21:25] <%Ashenik1> But like isnt Nihilus the most powerfull one maybe expet the Emperor?
[1:21:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> fine is fine
[1:21:28] <memejima> Remember how Kreia said that the Ancient Sith would have TRUMPED modern force users in lightsaber combat?
[1:21:29] <%DatAsuna> 3's multiplayer is the second best horde mode ever
[1:21:29] <+dumbgamerboy> Marauder Shields \o/
[1:21:32] <phatmac16> CHAT IS STILL SALTY ABOUT ME3
[1:21:32] <%spiritofmojave> 3 is sorta fine, now I have way more problems with a lack of planet exploration than the ending with the expandes content mod
[1:21:33] <Joestar1890> @alpacasintophats Then you are lost!
[1:21:36] <%Gruhunchously> Earlier she says taht Revan was the Heart of the Force
[1:21:37] <%M3djedx> (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*:ÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß
[1:21:39] <%DatAsuna> She's proud of Revan, but she LOVES you
[1:21:41] <%SouLucha> Mods will never heal that wound.
[1:21:43] <Rixstarian> @ballerswagbro9k Like a bandaid fixes an amputation
[1:21:43] <bbblaketwitching> feels bad man
[1:21:48] <Camail> she just spoiled the movies for me!
[1:21:48] <%JaceDarkstar> can we at least agree Andromeda was trash?
[1:21:49] <%DSD24> Marauder Shields is our boi
[1:21:50] <Joestar1890> Thanks Ithorians!
[1:21:50] <+oda_flobunaga> ME 3 is ToTaLlY a CrImE AgAInST HuMaNiTy !
[1:21:54] <%alpacasintophats> @Joestar1890 *begins the fight sequence on the lava planet*
[1:21:57] <chromdad> 3 was bad at the start. Never got to the end
[1:22:00] <%lotharrio> G0T0 has been blocked from saving the Republic. The true hero of this story.
[1:22:01] <%DSD24> @JaceDarkstar Andromeda had some decent stuff
[1:22:01] <Amardeux> if a mod has to fix the game, then the game isn't fine LUL
[1:22:03] <usurper_sos> Better call Saul Karath
[1:22:06] <%VCRUZZO> I need to finish ME3 at some point, only played the first 30 min and dropped it
[1:22:11] <Sapphire_Breeze> is Telos just Earth?
[1:22:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @rixstarian Check it out youll see
[1:22:17] <Joestar1890> @alpacasintophats *Battle of the Heroes INTENSIFIES*
[1:22:21] <dinnydanny777> Who will bring life? Aren't they Sith?
[1:22:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> i came in late did they fuck up the G0T0 plot?
[1:22:23] <+tearfuldevil> about = / = 4000 years
[1:22:23] <%lotharrio> @Sapphire_Breeze That's Tellus
[1:22:27] <Rixstarian> @ballerswagbro9k I have. It's not good enough
[1:22:28] <%krispen_wa> Tython is
[1:22:30] <+dumbgamerboy> Earth isn't in the star wars galaxy
[1:22:31] <huskarl_zap> What about Christopher Lee?
[1:22:31] <%DatAsuna> Andromeda is trash story, but I like the basic idea. Going back to ME1 gameplay and improving it, playing a frontier settler.
[1:22:34] <dinnydanny777> Oh I got confused
[1:22:37] <bbblaketwitching> mass effect 2.631 is objectively the best
[1:22:37] <+dumbgamerboy> its literally in a galaxy far, far away

[1:22:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> ME1's gameplay sucks
[1:22:43] <usurper_sos> What about the sequels?
[1:22:46] <%DSD24> @DatAsuna Plus the party was decent
[1:22:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> NO STATUE OF FANN Y PAK FUCK THAT
[1:22:51] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO earlier someone mentioned something about red tentacles in relation to the sith, were they referring to that red twiilek?
[1:22:52] <%DatAsuna> Yeah, so what if you improved it?
[1:23:01] <%sonofthedeepsouth> grey jedi never
[1:23:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> Free for the giant manta ray
[1:23:08] <%DatAsuna> Instead ME2 just swerved into playing like gears instead of playing like an exploration game.
[1:23:12] <huskarl_zap> Fannypak statue taken down HE OWNED A SLAVE
[1:23:14] <%VCRUZZO> Andromenda was a great idea but boy that main story and those side missions man

[1:25:56] <megamirk> she WANTED to kill the force, she never had a tangible means of doing that
[1:25:57] <mattynezz> NOPE
[1:25:57] <DavidDredd84> that's a cool idea
[1:25:57] <Camail> well she's dying so she knows that now
[1:25:58] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but it's not anyway is it, you can still change shit
[1:25:58] <Joostebrood> (Hint: Kreia wasn't actually trying to destroy the force here - it was bait for you.)
[1:25:59] <vigilant00> @RamenRiderZ But will not improve.
[1:26:01] <memejima> But she can‚Äôt predict you since you were cut off
[1:26:02] <%alpacasintophats> and at least *try* to defy your fate
[1:26:09] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur murderhobos are a real danger in nar shaddaa man
[1:26:11] <R3c0n31> How much of these visions are legit?, its future talk
[1:26:11] <+serpenttucker> If she had this knowledge in mind, she very clearly understood she still needed to act in the way she did.
[1:26:17] <+dragonzord12> "onderon shall remain in the republic" clone wars would like a word with that
[1:26:17] <coracor> but she didn't fail
[1:26:20] <%krispen_wa> Visions can change
[1:26:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> Malachor time ghosts are trying to guide this conversation
[1:26:22] <Camail> thats not a plot hole
[1:26:22] <%lotharrio> But all she sees are vague shapes. Can't see droids or Bao-Dur, implying that her future sight doesn't work on how any aliens or droids would change things.
[1:26:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> Do you think those guys are still falling?
[1:26:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Her main objective was not destroying the force. It was testing you.
[1:26:30] <vaderxyz1970> There not set in stone
[1:26:31] <mattynezz> Yeah, DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, HUH
[1:26:32] <GHouseduivel> She was making you stronger, even knowing she was going to die
[1:26:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> remember what Yoda said, the Future is not set
[1:26:33] <Joestar1890> @Joostebrood For what though? To make you as strong as Revan for the coming war?
[1:26:35] <bbblaketwitching> I really don't know why Granny isn't into tech with her ideal
[1:26:40] <%VCRUZZO> @optimasmaximas lol its the head tails on the twileks., if I remember correctly. look up darth Talon
[1:26:42] <%SouLucha> Woolie, who's to say this wasn't the Force intent all along?
[1:26:42] <+armor_kuma> Well could she also never really wanted to have killed the force? Just draw you here?
[1:26:43] <tolloponik> freedom terrifying limitless freedom
[1:26:44] <+dumbgamerboy> This was all an elaborate trap to get the Exile to show up so Kreia could pinch his cheeks and feed him hard candies. But you prevented that future.
[1:26:45] <usurper_sos> You're not there yet
[1:26:47] <bbblaketwitching> kinda sad really
[1:26:47] <%bread_assassin> Well, she didn't get that ability until just this moment.
[1:26:48] <Jmann9218> Yoda says the future isn't set
[1:26:49] <%heartlesshealer> Force cannot see itself die
[1:26:50] <Robot_Nixon_> sbfpPat .ÔΩ°oO ( sbfpDattebayo )
[1:26:58] <huskarl_zap> Anorlondo time ghosts fucking up the time line
[1:26:59] <%sonofthedeepsouth> but
[1:27:01] <%GrassCannon> so she's just raging against the machine?
[1:27:02] <zeow31> If she kills the force, the futur change, if she fails, the futur stays as she saw
[1:27:04] <Parapattern> If the force has a will, then wouldn't it make people see what it wants to ensure its survival?
[1:27:10] <Bruno_Tropical> a new defininiton of galaxy brain
[1:27:10] <subjectg> @liquiddinosaur the only echoes their gonna be sending are their screams
[1:27:12] <%sunriser101> its a force prank (gone wrong)
[1:27:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @bbblaketwitching she's a hypocrite. Its like if someone is like "everyone should be a prepper who can live innawoods" but she cant even light a campfire without accelerant and a lighter
[1:27:16] <%sonofthedeepsouth> free will CHADS

[1:27:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not binded to the force, not bound by fate.
[1:27:31] <dinnydanny777> So what I never get is if you can see the future, Kreia saw herself lose your fight
[1:27:35] <snakemuho> Jonafann Joy'pak
[1:27:36] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Leto II did nothing wrong
[1:27:39] <dinnydanny777> Kreia saw herself lose to you
[1:27:46] <vigilant00> A graveyard and a symbol.
[1:27:47] <MyNameIsRasus> WHAT ABOUT EXEGOL GRANNY
[1:27:47] <dinnydanny777> But she still fought
[1:27:48] <+dumbgamerboy> Kreia doesn't care about losing her fight tho
[1:27:49] <megamirk> why not fucking destroy Korriban
[1:27:50] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO oh trust me, im familiar with the name darth talon ( doodLewd ) but would she be counted as a true sith or something? cause im trying to figure out what that person meant lol
[1:27:52] <%DSD24> Korriban will be as it was a shithole
[1:27:53] <Jay444111> The force needs to be destroyed to save the universe.
[1:27:56] <RamenRiderZ> "Still a shithole"
[1:27:57] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 To make the Exile stronger
[1:28:00] <bbblaketwitching> comes off more as a pitable addict to me, but I see what you're saying
[1:28:03] <vigilant00> @MyNameIsRasus Crazy talk.
[1:28:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> Darth Talon is Darth Maul's friend
[1:28:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Your friends is dead

[1:28:11] <huskarl_zap> Darth Shitious

[1:28:18] <+dumbgamerboy> You and your friends are dead.
[1:28:21] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Chad Sith Empire
[1:28:22] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur She live without the force after her exile from the sith and did well... It's more like "That lighter is glued to my hand, may as well use it until I can get rid of it"
[1:28:23] <%Gruhunchously> Oh yeah, that was our old beach resort
[1:28:24] <PraiseHemra> exgol was just Sheevv's sex planet

Even when Kreia speaks again about killing the force in the core, she speaks about how the Exile's teaching are that death, the same way she didn't want to literally kill the Masters, but rather wanted herself proven right and a new path found. It was just bait

[1:32:02] <mattynezz> Cheer500 Second, when you tell Kreia "it's not too late to stop this" Kreia is actually happy. Her entire philosophy means she SHOULD have despised the very concept, but she didn't. This means she was able to recognize the bitterness and biases of being a bitter old coot with decades of suffering under her belt. By the end, if not at first, she didn't want to make the Exile a mini Kreia, as with her general beliefs, she only wanted the parts of her philosophy worth preserving to survive

It gets undercut a bit by TOR and the need for ongoing conflict, and the fact we only see the Jedi again when they are right back where they started, the Exile overcame their space PTSD, created a new Jedi that lasted 1000 YEARS before succumbing to apathy and dogma. That's longer than any Empire in human history. They did it, they changed what it means to be a Jedi, what the Force means to Universe for a time

[1:34:59] <bbblaketwitching> literally, the force removed her for that
[1:35:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> Kreia's just some shakespearian actress. like how Darth Sion's VA wrote the movie Sexy Beast
[1:35:00] <JohnAtDawn> He did
[1:35:02] <%Space_Pagan> LUL
[1:35:03] <usurper_sos> Of course Steve Blum
[1:35:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nani?
[1:35:06] <Joestar1890> Yeah, kinda
[1:35:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> lol whaaaaat
[1:35:10] <%DatAsuna> He's very self critical
[1:35:10] <mattynezz> LUL
[1:35:11] <wowowinsane> in some ways
[1:35:15] <zeow31> Avellone has a few flops but when he writes well, he makes it f*cking AWESOME
[1:35:17] <derap41> Vader as a storyline works but it falls apart in the detail
[1:35:18] <MarkUriah> How can you see Kreia and then make the Sequel movies?
[1:35:18] <phatmac16> He did
[1:35:18] <%wibbwobbler> cut the strings
[1:35:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> She's evil and a bitch but she also SORT of has a point? but not enough of a point that she isnt still evil
[1:35:21] <BYAKURENLOVER763> attack! and dethrone! God!
[1:35:25] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SHE WAS RIGHT
[1:35:27] <+mars_driver> @WoolieVersus Hey, V...talk about Arran Kae
[1:35:27] <R3c0n31> In some ways i can see why that was said
[1:35:29] <bbblaketwitching> NOTHING. WRONG.
[1:35:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NO SHE WAS RIGHT
[1:35:34] <%quinnage7> @WoolieVersus He also said that he wishes he wrote more dialogue of the Exile snapping back at her
[1:35:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> I wish there was a more involved narrative battle at the end. It's too binary for what the actual discussion and arguments are
[1:35:37] <%MrMoonGoose> #kreiadidnothingwrong
[1:35:37] <aiutare47> Liberate the galaxy from destiny
[1:35:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> KREIA DID MANY THINGS WRONG BUT ALSO A LOT OF STUFF RIGHT
[1:35:45] <+fabulousgaybear> fabulousgaybear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:35:45] <tolloponik> thats the best type of villan
[1:35:49] <+torusendor> Kreia is 1000% right
[1:35:49] <Joestar1890> I can SEE where you're coming from, but using a fucking DOOMSDAY MACHINE is not how you do it!
[1:35:52] <Doodle_Taco> KREIA HAD THE RIGHT IDEA
[1:36:04] <%VCRUZZO> @PlagueOfGripes agreed
[1:36:04] <Camail> then when she says she's happy you care BibleThump
[1:36:04] <%tuesti> she's fighting fate and destiny even though technically it's hopeless
[1:36:05] <%optimasmaximas> @VCRUZZO oh yea i love ahsoka and she's my favorite, but im bias and havent seen much of kreia, which is why i was wondering what people thought of ahsoka in regards to their favorite characters, and if ahsoka was in anyone's
[1:36:09] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LOOK IT
[1:36:09] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> The True Good Guy/Hero in this lost, just like in Char's Counterattack.
[1:36:10] <%orcstr16> If getting rid of the force didn't kill millions in the process, it would be the right move
[1:36:18] <%Gruhunchously> SHE GAVE THEM SO MANY CHANCES TO SEE WHERE THEY HAD GONE WRONG
[1:36:26] <phatmac16> This story peaked when she killed the council
[1:36:26] <%orcstr16> It would end the endless conflict of the jedi and sith that plagues the setting
[1:36:29] <%SouLucha> She did gave them so many chances.
[1:36:31] <bbblaketwitching> Atris
[1:36:32] <playdohface> Kreia is What The last jedi tried to be
[1:36:35] <%sonofthedeepsouth> >JEDI COUNCIL LUL
[1:36:36] <LunarRemix> You say that Woolie but there are people who are like that.
[1:36:38] <+jiggy_snipe> relgious zealots?
[1:36:41] <%wibbwobbler> and she genuinely loved the protag, great fucking villain
[1:36:43] <%sonofthedeepsouth> THE JEDIS ARE DUMB FUCKS
[1:36:44] <%Ashenik1> Hitler I get you, the jews are parasite to the society but your methods are a little bit too far.
[1:36:44] <aiutare47> @orcstr16 What is life without free will though?
[1:36:45] <%VCRUZZO> you would fail
[1:36:45] <bbblaketwitching> well, no, but almost
[1:36:46] <zeow31> @plagueofgripes I feel like the conversation is kinda done at this point. Either you agree or don't and you can still think about it or replau the game from the other side
[1:36:47] <%lotharrio> The system and the writing are at odds with each other, in a very interesting way.
[1:36:47] <+rosabellamelantha> Obi wan didn't act like a Jedi though
[1:36:49] <Bruno_Tropical> Luke disobeyed Yoda and Obi
[1:36:50] <Warfey> limesLUL

[1:37:08] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:37:08] <samura1_queen19> Between Kreia and Thanos, they both have kinda a right idea of things but were going on about it the wrong way.

[1:37:48] <Dementedpenguin> triggergod is quite a name
[1:37:50] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Obi Wan did have a secret relationship tho

[1:37:53] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YO
[1:37:55] <Doodle_Taco> YEP
[1:37:56] <SquigglyLizard> Garfield tested this
[1:37:59] <Joostebrood> Congratulations!
[1:38:01] <mattynezz> That's a great analogy
[1:38:04] <+theneosloth> vampire the masquerade bloodlines is another game like this but it's restored entirely by one somewhat crazy dude
[1:38:04] <memejima> GARFIELD
[1:38:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LEGALLY DISTINCT
[1:38:07] <%wibbwobbler> the people's champ
[1:38:08] <Bruno_Tropical> Obi Wan left that relationship super hard
[1:38:16] <AvailableThor> not now pat
[1:38:25] <+tearfuldevil> i dunno lol
[1:38:26] <+rosabellamelantha> Obi Wan was a "classic" grey jedi and not the meme version of gray where he still follows the jedi code but isn't like dogmatically tied to it and considers scenarios outside it
[1:38:27] <%optimasmaximas> PAT NO
[1:38:28] <thegreatbambe> uh
[1:38:34] <bbblaketwitching> NOTHINGGGG! WROOOOOONGGG!!! Except maybe a little...
[1:38:35] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @northsouthmiddledakota No, Char Aznable was the real hero of CCA, he wasn't a Nazi like the zabis. Dude was a true blue sin eater and amuro sentenced the universal century to thousands of years of war
[1:38:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Thanks fans
[1:38:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @bruno_tropical she died i believe
[1:38:37] <wowowinsane> this is one of the most significant mods ever made
[1:38:39] <+tearfuldevil> you haven't played many modded games Woolie
[1:38:44] <dinnydanny777> Obi Wan was a Gun Jedi
[1:38:44] <%optimasmaximas> oh neat
[1:38:45] <%VCRUZZO> yup
[1:38:45] <%Irridium> YEYEYE IT'S THE FUCKING SICKEST
[1:38:47] <Dagdammit> vampire bloodlines' restored content is noticeably poorer quality writing, I advise sticking to the basic fan patch.
[1:38:48] <Camail> YUP
[1:38:48] <%Space_Pagan> NICE
[1:38:49] <+taMsaN> YUP
[1:38:49] <+oda_flobunaga> Look at vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines when it released

[1:39:08] <%tuesti> such a good fucking game
[1:39:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> THE REAL SITH LORD WAS IN US ALL ALONG
[1:39:10] <%Gruhunchously> The one remaining Sith Lord
[1:39:13] <mattynezz> Dark Side in this game is so fun, it's just a shame the story is TOO GOOD to fuck it up by being an evil dick head
[1:39:14] <bbblaketwitching> The Trayal was in us all along
[1:39:15] <308caliber> yup this menu has all the sith lords
[1:39:15] <+dumbgamerboy> its nice how good this restored content is, compared to how awful the droid planet is

[1:39:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:32] <dinnydanny777> Does her being stood there imply that she didn't die if she's the last one?
[1:39:33] <%CyanDeadEye> Sounds like an Eva title
[1:39:35] <MisterSaintly> You guys really don't wanna know what happens in the story after that ending

[1:39:46] <Pechugaman> The Sith Lords were the friends we made along the way
[1:39:47] <Joestar1890> Just use the Revan model from KOTOR 1
[1:39:53] <dinnydanny777> But every Sith is Palpatine
[1:39:53] <Rixstarian> @mistersaintly It only goes downhill from here
[1:39:54] <+northsouthmiddledakota> @hieronymuszephyrinus What you think would happen if Char succed in destroying the fucking earth?
[1:39:54] <Bruno_Tropical> We really were the Kotor all along
[1:39:55] <%orcstr16> What happens with this game in swtor's lore?
[1:39:56] <KaiserMario> The Lords, but not The Emperor...
[1:40:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> SHhhhh
[1:40:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> no emperor
[1:40:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> shhhhhhhh this is the last game in the series
[1:40:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BUT EMPEROR THO
[1:40:11] <+dumbgamerboy> there's like 20 different characters it can load into the background and a lot of them are cut content
[1:40:11] <+Purple_badger3000> The game is completely worth it for Kreia and the ideas around her

[1:42:43] <Bruno_Tropical> @tearfuldevil Ooooh, ok thanks
[1:42:45] <+Freeborg23> @DSD24 Thanks :)
[1:42:47] <Joustar_> She is the deepest part of the shallowest puddle ever
[1:42:48] <+theneosloth> Kotor 2 is Knights of The Old Republic 2: Mask of the Betrayer
[1:42:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tearfuldevil uhhhhhh Jedi Knight? I dunno my metaphor doesnt work
[1:42:50] <%Ashenik1> Man Woolie you gotta play the witcher 3
[1:42:56] <endarren> Imagine if JJ Abram or Ruin Johnson found out about Kreia
[1:42:57] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur yeah lol
[1:42:57] <%Neoepochx> Kreia is subversion while adding to the Universe, not just tearing things down.
[1:43:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tearfuldevil maybe ANH and Empire Strikes Back?
[1:43:04] <bbblaketwitching> And she's basically a wife archetype simultaneously. its great
[1:43:06] <+Nothing_Wild> People walk too hard over Obsidian nowadays, but overshadowing modern Fallout isn‚Äôt all that hard.
[1:43:06] <+northsouthmiddledakota> he isn't a nazi okay i give in that. but his metods are super wrong in my book
[1:43:10] <%Gruhunchously> This is how you do a deconstruction
[1:43:11] <%VCRUZZO> people shit on kotor2 and I don't get it
[1:43:11] <bbblaketwitching> *waifu
[1:43:16] <%krispen_wa> This game came first so Mask of the Betrayer is just TSL II: Electric Boogaloo
[1:43:17] <%shadowsofpain> Woolie at some point in the future if you want to see Chris Avalone do his thing again, play fallout: New Vegas
[1:43:17] <%DSD24> @bbblaketwitching Isn't she more of a mom?
[1:43:20] <308caliber> so many great characters in this game
[1:43:21] <+buck_nastiest> do all the obsidian rpgs!
[1:43:24] <huskarl_zap> Didn't know Red versus Blue was that deep
[1:43:26] <%DatAsuna> damn patton
[1:43:27] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @northsouthmiddledakota it's not genocide. it's forcing a specific economic class to have to intermingle with the rest of humanity
[1:43:27] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE PLAY MASK OF THE BETRAYER
[1:43:31] <prince_johnny_> I love obisidian
[1:43:35] <Joestar1890> Woolie VS Fallout New Vegas would be great
[1:43:37] <Camail> like how dnd has patron gods
[1:43:39] <vigilant00> some of time
[1:43:42] <VJdarkworld> @ashenik1 witcher 3: hearts of stone specifically
[1:43:42] <%DSD24> Isn't Mask of the Betrayer DLC?
[1:43:42] <%Irridium> yeah after this game I've just been engaging with Star Wars like "well it's not going to be as good as KOTOR 2..." Closest it came to this again was TLJ which I did like but... not as good as this.
[1:43:43] <bbblaketwitching> fair, but the thirst is strong
[1:43:47] <Bruno_Tropical> Unless you are a Nightsister of course
[1:43:49] <+tearfuldevil> @krispen_wa ooooh i forgot about that, that shit is good
[1:43:56] <%krispen_wa> MotB is pretty standalone
[1:43:57] <+armor_kuma> @VCRUZZO I mean it wasnt really finished so i can kind of see it
[1:44:01] <%DSD24> @bbblaketwitching Hey man people are into milfs so it still fits
[1:44:07] <Rixstarian> @dsd24 Expansion campaign. DLC is too light a word
[1:44:10] <vigilant00> Erhhh
[1:44:10] <%wibbwobbler> Can't wait to see Disney's take on this neat universe!
[1:44:11] <KaiserMario> It's kinda like Kingdom Hearts then...
[1:44:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NAH BE SHITTY YOU CAN SHOOT LIGHTNING
[1:44:14] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Oh cool they haven't started yet!
[1:44:15] <%DSD24> @Rixstarian Ah my mistake
[1:44:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Irridium The Last Jedi is bad even if it tried to do things different. it DOES get points for trying but nah still bad
[1:44:17] <+northsouthmiddledakota> @hieronymuszephyrinus by killing at least millions of people. fuck that
[1:44:18] <%alpacasintophats> this is very much the reasoning why I like 40k stuff like this as well. It has this exact same kind of thing and it's fantastic
[1:44:19] <%SouLucha> "Hopefully..."
[1:44:21] <JetpackMcQuack> BlessRNG
[1:44:22] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BEING SHITTY IS COOLER IN SW
[1:44:23] <+Nothing_Wild> Eh...
[1:44:26] <%ggbhtg> Life Style = Death Style, in Star Wars
[1:44:27] <+dumbgamerboy> so do you think visas has vestigial eye sockets, or just smooth no-eyes flatskin?
[1:44:31] <bbblaketwitching> ...very true
[1:44:39] <%Deft_Thought> So much of the Force relies on an absurd set of inflexible dogmatic principles. Kreia is a scientist; she's seeing the Force as a system rather than a binary and recognizes its presence is destructive in creating hyper-linear thought with incredible power behind it
[1:44:42] <vigilant00> Force powers /// to uch
[1:44:44] <Rixstarian> @dsd24 Easy one to make in today's marketing. All good bro cohh7
[1:44:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dumbgamerboy she has eyesockets and they had skin but they got blown out by the Death Wave. but maybe they healed
[1:44:52] <%Neoepochx> @Irridium The Last Jedi has no actual story. It is literally an episode of Seinfeld where nothing fucking happens, and everyone becomes stupid for no reason.
[1:44:54] <+buck_nastiest> woolie you should go through the Jedi outcast series!
[1:44:55] <+serpenttucker> Star wars is "What is karma had more weight then words?"
[1:44:56] <MarkUriah> @dumbgamerboy its no eyes flatskin
[1:44:56] <+PlagueOfGripes> and then the universe killed billions just to help a burnt kid throw an old man over a railing. kind of the issue with the way the setting works
[1:44:59] <bbblaketwitching> @deft_thought ^^^^^^
[1:45:02] <montgomerynw> They cover up where their eyes would be so it's got to be horrific for outsiders
[1:45:04] <+Nothing_Wild> TLJ was at best, a very bad version of this. It wasn‚Äôt new or inventive. It was a parody, at best.
[1:45:06] <+zanzibar_junker> IDEON JUDGED YOU FOR IT
[1:45:09] <memejima> No joke but the force literally doesn‚Äôt account for Light Later
[1:45:10] <%Gruhunchously> @dumbgamerboy She has sort of impressions in her skin where her eyes would be, there's official art somewhere.
[1:45:10] <zeow31> @dumbgamerboy Vestigial eyes socket, that'd explain why she hide her "eyes"
[1:45:13] <huskarl_zap> it's like poetry plauge
[1:45:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dumbgamerboy google Unseen Unheard there's a picture of Visas without her mask Warning: its her with her fucking empty gaping black eye sockets and kind of gross
[1:45:19] <kojimbopro> Last Jedi was good
[1:45:22] <dinnydanny777> is anyone really wrong though
[1:45:28] <dinnydanny777> From My point of View
[1:45:34] <bbblaketwitching> yes
[1:45:34] <Bruno_Tropical> watch Space Runaway Ideon Woolie
[1:45:35] <ashenjuan25> The Jedi did become infallible until the PT
[1:45:37] <wowowinsane> chris avellone liked kotor 1 a lot iirc
[1:45:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> If you cut the casino scene maybe i'd give it a chance
[1:45:38] <%VCRUZZO> @armor_kuma that I understood, but the story and questions brought up are so interesting and people shit on that too
[1:45:46] <huskarl_zap> It's like Japanese poetry the beginning and end doesn't have to make sense
[1:45:48] <+fizzguy47> they should stick googly eyws
[1:46:07] <Joestar1890> KOTOR 2 is a better Last Jedi
[1:46:08] <+dumbgamerboy> so vestigial eye sockets is confirmed, neat
[1:46:10] <%Gruhunchously> The Prequel Trilogy is responsible for much of what make the Jedi irredeemable assholes.
[1:46:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @wowowinsane you cant critique somethin unless you really love it
[1:46:11] <+armor_kuma> @VCRUZZO Oh lmao those people are shitty then i dont get that
[1:46:16] <+cvp5127> thats not market viable
[1:46:16] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur The casino and whole Finn subplot was stupid... The rest was decent to good in places
[1:46:17] <+dumbgamerboy> can you have sex with an eye socket?
[1:46:20] <dinnydanny777> Really the Star Wars universe is way too moralistic
[1:46:22] <%DatAsuna> swtor's very much back to that tone where the questions just come in occassionally on the side, but never the main thing
[1:46:24] <+PlagueOfGripes> that's why a lot of hardcore star wars fans also hate this game. because it isn't a cartoon like George wanted it to be
[1:46:24] <bbblaketwitching> obviously
[1:46:27] <arkv01> star wars was... a mistake
[1:46:33] <phatmac16> bad example
[1:46:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:35] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @HieronymusZephyrinus
[1:46:37] <Bruno_Tropical> I just wish it wasnt about the Jedi and the sith all the time
[1:46:39] <+zanzibar_junker> The Force should be stopped
[1:46:41] <%sonofthedeepsouth> CRUEL ANGELS THESIS IN THE BACKGROUND
[1:46:45] <ashenjuan25> Kotor 2 is last jedi when not weighed down by the franchise of Star Wars
[1:46:46] <%NopeBadguy> @woolieversus I would like to shout out the Video Essay: The Philosophy of Kreia, as an analysis of Star Wars in the context of KOTOR 2.
[1:46:46] <Bruno_Tropical> Star Wars Watchmen
[1:46:48] <akman14> If only NGE was good LUL
[1:46:50] <Doodle_Taco> IT IS WATCH IT
[1:46:50] <+r_Foeburden87> Madoka totally is
[1:46:51] <+Nothing_Wild> If you cut everything but Rey‚Äôs plot, and developed that, instead of the casino and slow-speed chase, it could be worked with.
[1:46:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @wowowinsane i once went to a book signing by Frank Miller and he said how he only shits on Superman so hard in his books because he LIKES superman and just was bitter about how he got conflated with like, Reagan-style America in the 80s
[1:46:52] <%wibbwobbler> unforgiven of star wars
[1:46:53] <ovlarigalnea> Watch Mokoka
[1:46:55] <subjectg> Evangelion is a pretty bad example but whatever
[1:46:57] <MyNameIsRasus> ZANKOKU NA JEDI NO TEEZE
[1:47:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Madoka scarred me
[1:47:00] <startstoprepeat> become meguca
[1:47:01] <CookieDoughFK> madoka is good
[1:47:02] <ovlarigalnea> Modoka*
[1:47:03] <SummonerMagno> Madoka chapter 3.... ooof
[1:47:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> already sent him the Kreia Philosophy video
[1:47:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Watch more Urobutchi series
[1:47:08] <+oda_flobunaga> Again, why Avellone's writing is soo good
[1:47:09] <%GrassCannon> fr tho watch Madoka
[1:47:09] <+dumbgamerboy> MODOK-a
[1:47:10] <%DatAsuna> @PlagueOfGripes Also a lot of it is generational tribalism, lot of people grew up with clone wars and fiercely insist it's the best and only valid version.
[1:47:11] <+Deano8817> I've not watched a single day of magical girl shit and Madoka is one of my favorite anime
[1:47:11] <bbblaketwitching> poor ass Madoka
[1:47:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> nO KYUBE
[1:47:13] <%lotharrio> Madoka is worth a watch.
[1:47:13] <phatmac16> Eva isn't a deconstruction, but sure
[1:47:16] <+BioHunter> and then everyone tried to copy madoka
[1:47:17] <kojimbopro> Eva is not a deconstruction oh my god end that meme
[1:47:19] <+zanzibar_junker> Watch Ideon
[1:47:22] <%dollarstored> Woolie been on blast, never seen brotherhood or madoka
[1:47:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I'm gonna fight Brazilian Night
[1:47:26] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, I can't see someone who hates Star Wars writing this story
[1:47:26] <phatmac16> Become Meguca
[1:47:27] <+northsouthmiddledakota> @hieronymuszephyrinus also for what i remeber in the end he didn't even cared about that. he was just depressed and basically was trying to suicide by Amuro
[1:47:29] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HUE HUEHUE
[1:47:29] <the38bandit> madoka is great that, movie ending tho.........
[1:47:33] <Cacherow> There are also people who love something so much they refuse to be critical
[1:47:33] <mrkatmonarchy> Finn should' ve been a Jedi
[1:47:34] <%orcstr16> This is the best Star Wars has ever been. Nothing can top it, unfortunately. I would love for the setting to explore more than most of the movies do, but it is what it is.
[1:47:34] <%wibbwobbler> eva is a deconstruction guys...
[1:47:34] <%Neoepochx> Some strong writing comes from a source of anger.
[1:47:37] <Joestar1890> @ashenjuan25 Except Rian was never weighed down and made the product he wanted, same with Chris Avellone
[1:47:37] <+Nothing_Wild> It‚Äôs a bummer that Obsidian burned their bridge with Avellone.
[1:47:38] <kojimbopro> The deconstruction meme needs to end
[1:47:39] <ashenjuan25> Criticism doesn‚Äôt mean you hate something
[1:47:40] <zeow31> @phatmac16 Eva deconstruct the mecha / gundam genre
[1:47:40] <dinnydanny777> Star Wars movies but with like, normal people
[1:47:45] <%alpacasintophats> there's no way this was written from a place of hate or disinterest. that's last jedi writing if you want an example of that
[1:47:46] <%sonofthedeepsouth> DO NOT THROW SOULS
[1:47:47] <+zanzibar_junker> Eva is Ideon
[1:47:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Nothing_Wild they did?
[1:47:48] <+SolidusRex> Exile should become meguca
[1:47:50] <dinnydanny777> How about a Star Wars movie about Han or Lando
[1:47:53] <%dollarstored> Why fite?
[1:47:54] <Doodle_Taco> Rebellion is the SWTOR of Madoka
[1:47:54] <%Ashenik1> and just hate women
[1:47:55] <akman14> Nah if you are critical at all it means you heat the think Kappa
[1:47:58] <%optimasmaximas> @Nothing_Wild what happened between them?
[1:48:01] <%sonofthedeepsouth> AND DIRECTORS FUCK UP
[1:48:02] <MarkUriah> Imagine thinking criticism means you hate it? Imagine if that thought existed in real life?
[1:48:03] <Bruno_Tropical> i dont want to see SW with normal people, i just want new stuff
[1:48:05] <tolloponik> sucks that this game is hated by bio-ware and Disney, and did everything to make it non-canon
[1:48:06] <huskarl_zap> Finn should of just said he was a jedi like Rey said she was a skywalker
[1:48:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> AND LUCAS FUCKS UP
[1:48:07] <%Irridium> And Disney Mandates
[1:48:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BEING SW IS SUFFERING
[1:48:12] <%brachydios777> Star wars is gonna be interesting with people growing up with the sequels becoming adults
[1:48:12] <%Neoepochx> I believe that Avellone said that it came from a place of anger.
[1:48:12] <Camail> they took the job cuz its a stable fan base with reliable income
[1:48:14] <JetpackMcQuack> FeelsBadMan
[1:48:14] <dinnydanny777> Oh wait I guess that was Rogue One
[1:48:14] <%VCRUZZO> @PlagueOfGripes is that what it is? Why the hate for such an arbitrary reason?
[1:48:15] <bbblaketwitching> What?!? Starwars not being told well?!?! When does THAT happen!?!1?
[1:48:30] <%DatAsuna> good analogy
[1:48:31] <+oda_flobunaga> APATHY IS THE END OF GIVING A FUCK
[1:48:32] <uncledoodsauce> I pray everyday FF7 Remake doesn't end up like this.
[1:48:33] <+Nothing_Wild> @liquiddinosaur Look up what happened. But Avellone it was a lot.
[1:48:35] <prince_johnny_> Yea
[1:48:36] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @northsouthmiddledakota he wanted to succeed and beat amuro in a fair fight. whatever happened happened, as long as he succeeded. there's a reason I called him a sin eater. he even referred to himself as such
[1:48:36] <huskarl_zap> How did anakin's mom get the name skywalker?
[1:48:39] <memejima> You want the thing you like be at its peak performance
[1:48:41] <ralphfromdk> Matrix 4 is gonna be interesting... maybe not good, but interesting
[1:48:45] <zeow31> @neoepochx Nah, avellone said multiple times that he was / is a hardcore star wars nerd
[1:48:46] <snakemuho> Matrix sequels are good
[1:48:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> so in "canon" in Legends, Meetra Surik (canon Exile) got information on Revan's whereabouts and Bao-Dur's remote used the mass shadow gen to destroy the planet. so it's just gone for good
[1:48:53] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reloaded had some really interesting ideas
[1:48:56] <%sonofthedeepsouth> No they werent
[1:49:02] <+Nothing_Wild> Like they were trying to coerce him into a shitty contract, using his sick mom as leverage.

[1:49:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Of course you did.
[1:49:07] <mattynezz> Didn't Animatrix follow Reloaded?
[1:49:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Matrix sequels were a bunch of shite

[1:49:27] <ashenjuan25> Star Wars has been a parody of itself since Return of the Jedi and it‚Äôs depressing to see how creatively bankrupt it became because the series and movies have been trying to recreate the elements of what people assume is the successes of the first two movies it‚Äôs why I hate that Leia turned out to be a skywalker

[1:50:01] <KiddKame> "Fedora V" AU when?
[1:50:02] <Divryne> console.delete(fedora)
[1:50:03] <Bruno_Tropical> You chose a diferent path in the crossroads of destiny
[1:50:07] <+Nothing_Wild> He works now as a freelancer, like he worked on Fallen Order.
[1:50:13] <%sonofthedeepsouth> FEDORA V STUDIED THE BLADE
[1:50:20] <usurper_sos> Fedora V is truly the worst timeline
[1:50:23] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> pleather perfection
[1:50:24] <+Nothing_Wild> But Avellone probably will never work with Obsidian again.
[1:50:28] <chromdad> God exists, proven
[1:50:30] <ashenjuan25> Damn v
[1:50:34] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> clipped out of reality
[1:50:37] <%shadowsofpain> UR Fedora V drop
[1:50:37] <%quinnage7> @WoolieVersus Btw the Exile is canonically a Woman
[1:50:44] <zeow31> @neoepochx I'd have to double check, maybe he became one after reading everything but there's an interview of him on YouTube where he even spoke of recent Star Wars shit he followed
[1:50:46] <%krispen_wa> The Exile is SO GOOD as a protag
[1:50:48] <dinnydanny777> This game must be weird if you don't play as a Jedi or a Sith at all
[1:50:51] <+Nothing_Wild> And I feel like his absence shows in their current games.
[1:50:52] <%tuesti> yess
[1:50:54] <+kewlmyc> Just got here. Did they already beat it?
[1:50:55] <olaksi> That's the correct way to write this type of main character usually
[1:50:55] <%MrMoonGoose> A true mad hoe
[1:51:02] <%DatAsuna> The party is fantastic and Atris is a great character, terrible person
[1:51:05] <%tuesti> @kewlmyc yes
[1:51:06] <Joestar1890> Atris is a great antagonist
[1:51:06] <ashenjuan25> Mira still sucks ass
[1:51:08] <Badgerconda_> Why is Woolie wearing my grandma's couch?
[1:51:09] <%Irridium> We're never gonna get a smuggler-type as good as Atton and that hurts man
[1:51:12] <%MrMoonGoose> The maddest of hoes
[1:51:12] <%VCRUZZO> are you okay girl?
[1:51:14] <+kewlmyc> @tuesti Cool,thanks
[1:51:15] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> @northsouthmiddledakota yes, but considering the history that happened after, amuro ultimately killed billions and billions of people with his actions to save some rich psychopaths on a planet that genuinely needed a long rest.
[1:51:17] <%Gruhunchously> Vrook was also on the Council
[1:51:19] <chromdad> Bao best boi
[1:51:21] <+oda_flobunaga> well council members rotate
[1:51:24] <dinnydanny777> Well the council were shitbirds
[1:51:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> brap
[1:51:29] <KiddKame> I think a modern example of "Hard Blue becoming Red" is Mace Windu In Episode 3. Before finding out Palpatine wa a Sith, Windu was OPENLY planning with other Council members to FORCIBLY remove the Palpatine from office and have his Jedi "Temporarily" take over.
[1:51:30] <dinnydanny777> It was a shit council
[1:51:30] <%Gruhunchously> And smelled those farts
[1:51:31] <+PlagueOfGripes> idiots elect idiots
[1:51:35] <huskarl_zap> @badgerconda_ THE trueist questions
[1:51:37] <+egalitarian696969> jedi fart = light brap
[1:51:45] <dinnydanny777> Just because you got on the council doesn't make you a good Jedi
[1:51:46] <+senfood> She's so light side that she goes full dark side and doesn't believe you because she's so delusional.
[1:51:53] <357Sneak> its just a lightsaber noise
[1:51:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @KiddKame did they not suspect him at that point?
[1:51:55] <bbblaketwitching> she had active effects rather than passive. which is far more than you can say for the other jedi characters
[1:51:58] <usurper_sos> The jedi literally spend all their time sniffing their own farts, so it checks out
[1:52:00] <memejima> she goes to the other side of the spectrum
[1:52:07] <%DatAsuna> Remember when atris bodied sion and nihilus in all that concept art? xD
[1:52:10] <%SouLucha> So full of herself.
[1:52:10] <bbblaketwitching> fuck her tho
[1:52:10] <%Gruhunchously> She's the moral preacher with so many skeletons in her closet
[1:52:11] <+senfood> She was sitting in a room full of Sith holocrons, chastising you for falling to the dakr side.
[1:52:12] <Bruno_Tropical> Darth Karen
[1:52:14] <ashenjuan25> The Jedi have always been wrong
[1:52:20] <ashenjuan25> Even in the OT
[1:52:22] <$Invlux> Ultra Instinct Karen
[1:52:22] <Doodle_Taco> That's kind of the whole time of the game
[1:52:24] <%ggbhtg> Karen BEYONDO
[1:52:28] <ralphfromdk> Sitting in that room, going "this is fine"
[1:52:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> even Yoda didn't deny that the Jedi needed to take over. he just described it as an unfortunate reality, and they had to "wait and see." so same general problem
[1:52:46] <ashenjuan25> Yoda said let Han and Leia die in Empire
[1:52:54] <%Gruhunchously> She does make a handful of appearences
[1:52:54] <%DatAsuna> Yoda said kill vader
[1:52:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> Atris caused the entire plot. She lured Nihilus to Katarr
[1:52:57] <%tuesti> what happened to Atris after you left? do we assume she left?
[1:53:02] <%Atomik456> if you hack in force vision early does she show up red?
[1:53:03] <memejima> It fucking sucks that the sequels just made it out that the Jedi were the best, the critique of the jedi from tlj was one of my fav parts of it
[1:53:05] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NICE
[1:53:06] <308caliber> [Sith hisssinngggggg]
[1:53:13] <%sonofthedeepsouth> A BETTER JEDI
[1:53:16] <bbblaketwitching> truly, she was Kare'in about Fann'Pak
[1:53:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> SHIN JEDI
[1:53:23] <usurper_sos> Make Jedi great again
[1:53:25] <%krispen_wa> YOU
[1:53:25] <+senfood> Vrook.
[1:53:26] <$Invlux> ehh forget the whole thing
[1:53:26] <%Irridium> @Atomik456 don't even need to hack just switch to Kreia and look and yes she is
[1:53:28] <AllTheZibas> You know what forget the blackjack!
[1:53:31] <+Freeborg23> Kavar?
[1:53:33] <%wibbwobbler> nobody is infallible, even yoda and Luke
[1:53:33] <prime_name> Handmaiden?
[1:53:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[1:53:35] <MarkUriah> The Exile
[1:53:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NOW MAKE WOOLIE PLAY LEGACY OF KAIN
[1:53:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> "what the fuck is a true Jedi"
[1:53:38] <%Neoepochx> @zeow31 In a 2009 interview he described a lot of the creative process that he had at the time as coming from a "place of hatred," and while it wasn't healthy it helped him spawn better writing for the project.
[1:53:39] <%Atomik456> @Irridium rad
[1:53:42] <%VCRUZZO> They would have been Jedi in name, acting and becoming Sith
[1:53:45] <dinnydanny777> Every Jedi in this game is a shit
[1:53:45] <chromdad> Man, any starr wars would improve with the holocron wrestling crowd
[1:53:46] <%Gruhunchously> Handmaiden, Bao-Dur
[1:53:49] <%SouLucha> No Sith, no Jedi... Only man.
[1:53:51] <%ggbhtg> just like real life!
[1:53:52] <phatmac16> handmaiden
[1:53:57] <308caliber> Kreia said that the party is the true jedi
[1:53:58] <memejima> Who in all of Star Wars even is a True Jedi?
[1:53:59] <bbblaketwitching> okay, now do the hame again but speedrun it.
[1:54:00] <megamirk> Kavar's heart is in the right place but he's like "I don't know anything"
[1:54:00] <dinnydanny777> Atton was a better Jedi than every Jedi character
[1:54:02] <Bruno_Tropical> Vrook so boomer
[1:54:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> DJ PROFESSOR K THE SUICIDAL BALD-MULLET JEDI WITH A FANG EARRING WHO LIVES IN THE HOOD
[1:54:10] <+PlagueOfGripes> there is no obi-won here
[1:54:13] <dinnydanny777> Atton was a better Jedi than Vrook and Atris
[1:54:13] <olaksi> Calling your party the True Jedi is correct, it's always the fringe ones who do the right thing
[1:54:15] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:54:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> Kavar is ok
[1:54:25] <zeow31> @neoepochx My bad, I must've misremembred
[1:54:25] <%DatAsuna> Kavar
[1:54:29] <%VCRUZZO> as soon you meet Vrook, you already go fuck this guy
[1:54:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> what was Vash going to be like before Cut Content
[1:54:33] <megamirk> Zez Kai was also reasonable
[1:54:38] <MarkUriah> But then they get together
[1:54:40] <bbblaketwitching> but apathy is death
[1:54:46] <chromdad> But he didnt stop vrook
[1:54:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> @megamirk but he's apathetic.
[1:54:50] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:54:52] <%VCRUZZO> Kavar though, you hoped he qould give you more
[1:54:56] <+Nothing_Wild> @memejima I liked that movie at first, but it was done in such a haphazard way. Even the prequels and OT implicitly went over that. It‚Äôs not inherently a bad idea, but Johnson is incapable of exploring it.
[1:54:56] <ShyDispatch> Vash would've been similar to Kavaar
[1:54:58] <ashenjuan25> Zez Kai was just a defeatist
[1:55:00] <e3a4> Kavar got promoted to Jedi Master because they needed someone to fill a seat. He is the JarJar of Kotor
[1:55:04] <megamirk> shouldn't be on the council
[1:55:06] <montgomerynw> According to content in the game she was one of the first to call for him to be exiled so that's what we've got to work with
[1:55:08] <%Neoepochx> @zeow31 NP, it is actually interesting, because he liked Star Wars, but was hesitant to write KotoR 2 because he hated the Force LUL
[1:55:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> a bunch of fuck ups
[1:55:15] <huskarl_zap> Fannie confirmed not a jedii
[1:55:16] <+oda_flobunaga> They become the founders of the order, moving forward
[1:55:17] <%Neoepochx> I'm rewatching an old video on it.
[1:55:18] <%wibbwobbler> apathy is death?
[1:55:18] <dinnydanny777> All of the Jedi in this game were Dark Jedi
[1:55:22] <Joestar1890> The lost Jedi were the party you made along the way
[1:55:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> a merry band of fuck ups even
[1:55:27] <bbblaketwitching> APATHY IS DEATH
[1:55:28] <ShyDispatch> And then she'd sacrifice herself to stall Sion.
[1:55:30] <dinnydanny777> Every single Jedi in this game has fallen
[1:55:36] <%VCRUZZO> apathy is death. Apathy is bitch cowards
[1:55:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> THEIR ACTIONS SUCK THO
[1:55:41] <+PlagueOfGripes> characters are designed as an extension of the story they're telling and its themes? what a strange concept.
[1:55:43] <%tuesti> they never relied on the force
[1:55:43] <%optimasmaximas> nice
[1:55:44] <%SouLucha> The True Jedi are the friends we made along the way!
[1:55:48] <+egalitarian696969> time to play an mmo rip
[1:55:51] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BUT THEY DO
[1:55:52] <memejima> @nothing_wild It also sucks that JJ and the rest of the writing team just decided to erase all aspects of the film, including that part of it, making Luke the biggest backtracked
[1:55:53] <usurper_sos> But they get repeated anyway
[1:55:55] <%krispen_wa> they last 4000 years tho
[1:55:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> how many times has the Jedi order been destroyed and rebuilt?
[1:56:01] <bbblaketwitching> I'm pretty apathetic tho even as I say that...
[1:56:01] <megamirk> Anakin was like Atris
[1:56:04] <+senfood> IT'S LIKE POETRY. IT RHYMES.
[1:56:06] <%DatAsuna> 4000 years is a good run
[1:56:06] <chromdad> So you‚Äôre saying the force forces people
[1:56:07] <bbblaketwitching> oh well
[1:56:08] <%Gruhunchously> MAYBE THERE'S SOME FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN THE TEACHINGS
[1:56:08] <megamirk> I killed the sand people but I'm still good
[1:56:09] <dinnydanny777> It's almost like balance
[1:56:10] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:56:13] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:56:14] <bbblaketwitching> oif
[1:56:16] <ralphfromdk> It's almost like Kreia was right....
[1:56:16] <dinnydanny777> It's almost like poetry
[1:56:17] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[1:56:18] <mattynezz> LUL
[1:56:18] <+MidnightBurst12> truth
[1:56:19] <%MrMoonGoose> Tenzin gets better
[1:56:19] <laguerrilha> Maybe dont make a religion around the mystic powers
[1:56:19] <%sonofthedeepsouth> TENZIN WAS NICE
[1:56:20] <Joestar1890> And then it happens AGAIN in the Sequel trilogy!
[1:56:20] <MarkUriah> LuL
[1:56:20] <+taMsaN> he's based tho
[1:56:21] <+oda_flobunaga> It's almost like how there is this conflict between two brothers who keep being reincarnated
[1:56:22] <357Sneak> khaLUL
[1:56:30] <HeroSolaire> Tenzin gets his ass wooped every fuckin season
[1:56:33] <%wibbwobbler> palpatines empire lasted like 20 years lol
[1:56:33] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @e3a4
[1:56:35] <tolloponik> Tenzin is good though
[1:56:38] <memejima> Well actually 3 babies
[1:56:40] <HeroSolaire> master of air more like master of none
[1:56:40] <%sonofthedeepsouth> TENZIN IS A GOOD PART OF KORRA
[1:56:40] <dinnydanny777> Hey listen we get a decent twenty years that's great, right?
[1:56:47] <+Nothing_Wild> Avellone should have been the writer for the sequel trilogy.
[1:56:48] <megamirk> FOR MANDALORE
[1:56:49] <%bread_assassin> It took less than that for Episode 6 Luke to turn into Episode 8 Luke.
[1:56:49] <phatmac16> F
[1:56:50] <%MrMoonGoose> Tenzin is really, really interesting once you figure out why he is the way he is
[1:56:50] <Joestar1890> I don't even think there was a council at that time either, Luke just kinda fucked up!
[1:56:51] <%Gruhunchously> Bao was done dirty
[1:56:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> Yo! Hi all, I haven't seen anything today, I assume he finally finish it all?
[1:56:55] <%Ashenik1> What is wrong with TENZIN my BOY ANGERY
[1:56:55] <MarkUriah> Bao deserves more
[1:56:58] <%tuesti> the potentiallllll
[1:56:58] <%spiritofmojave> :c
[1:56:58] <dinnydanny777> I miss him
[1:56:58] <ashenjuan25> I think Jedi have always kind of sucked at least in the OT, yoda said let han, Leia and chewie die in empire, the told Luke to kill Vader and were willing to be ok with Luke dying in empire because they would have just gone after Leia given Luke would sacrifice himself for his friends
[1:57:00] <usurper_sos> Bao could have been so much more
[1:57:02] <dinnydanny777> I miss Bao
[1:57:04] <+ItsRatman> am I late? did i miss everything?
[1:57:07] <chromdad> F for bao
[1:57:07] <+MidnightBurst12> they did him dirty
[1:57:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> he's black ASMR Oppenheimer
[1:57:09] <time_axis> if you make him dark side he looks more like darth maul
[1:57:10] <montgomerynw> Took a 1000 years of preperation for 20 years of Imperial Rule
[1:57:12] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> BibleThump
[1:57:15] <%DatAsuna> I love his voice
[1:57:15] <Halospaz117> @ItsRatman yup
[1:57:15] <phatmac16> F FOR BAO
[1:57:17] <ralphfromdk> So, how about that Kreia being handmaidens mother theory
[1:57:21] <prince_johnny_> F
[1:57:24] <dinnydanny777> He got subbed out in the 50th minute
[1:57:27] <%tuesti> his awarenessss
[1:57:32] <tidalwafer> Bao looks like Marlin Brando
[1:57:33] <chromdad> He punchy and soothy
[1:57:36] <wowowinsane> i cant believe how many people dont understand bao dur or think he's boring
[1:57:39] <bbblaketwitching> kinda a conceptually anime design for his physical traits really
[1:57:42] <memejima> His sassiness and personality
[1:57:43] <%SouLucha> I honestly forget what happened to him.
[1:57:43] <TransDoomGuy> @ralphfromdk wasn't that confirmed false?
[1:57:46] <ashenjuan25> The Jedi were at its best when they were portrayed as flawed concepts
[1:57:47] <Halospaz117> JUST SHOW IT
[1:57:48] <aiutare47> Bao is the epitome of ‚Äúgood soldiers follow orders‚Äù
[1:57:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> same
[1:57:52] <%VCRUZZO> at LEAST
[1:57:57] <ColbyBryant> Bao's laser arm is so dumb
[1:57:58] <prince_johnny_> Samee
[1:58:00] <KiddKame> @montgomerynw 50 years if you count the Sequals
[1:58:01] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus the wiki seems to think he survived and founded the Jedi Order with everyone
[1:58:01] <Halospaz117> He should have done what the remote did
[1:58:03] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> supposedly bao-dur's VA was in OZ, but I don't remember who he played
[1:58:08] <ralphfromdk> TransDoomGuy Yeah, but it still seem to fit so good :l
[1:58:11] <memejima> He should‚Äôve done the big sacrifice
[1:58:12] <chromdad> He shoulda
[1:58:17] <%tuesti> yes,
[1:58:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ColbyBryant you'd think they'd remove it when they realized it made him unable to wear ANYTHING
[1:58:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> yeah!
[1:58:21] <dinnydanny777> It would have been better if he had even peaced out before that and that was why he left
[1:58:22] <mattynezz> Sounds correct
[1:58:22] <%DatAsuna> Wookiepedia is not concrete
[1:58:22] <%optimasmaximas> @e3a4 can you whisper me that link?
[1:58:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YOU DID THIS..... ID DI THIS
[1:58:27] <MarkUriah> Somebody else might've gotten it wrong
[1:58:28] <%Gruhunchously> That should have been his ending, yes
[1:58:33] <memejima> It would‚Äôve been the perfectly saddest ending for him
[1:58:34] <%wibbwobbler> no jgl?
[1:58:37] <chromdad> LIKE POTTERY
[1:58:40] <Joestar1890> @ashenjuan25 Except the movie shows that Luke's friends would have been okay if he didn't intervene with Lando leading a rebellion of sorts in Cloud City when he turns back into a face
[1:58:44] <ColbyBryant> @LiquidDinosaur it just looks really stupid
[1:58:44] <Halospaz117> MY BOI
[1:58:44] <bbblaketwitching> pazzack?
[1:58:45] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> 1 4 M O N T H S
[1:58:47] <%christopherwpoindexter> yes
[1:58:49] <%DatAsuna> Atton goes hard
[1:58:51] <%Gruhunchously> Pazaak
[1:58:52] <dinnydanny777> If he had actually been like "I'm not going there" and left at least that's an ending
[1:58:54] <+jiggy_snipe> by helping HK, he does fix the problem
[1:58:57] <+therabbles> Atton was present and did his job
[1:58:59] <ralphfromdk> Barth indeed, nothing more, nothing less
[1:58:59] <%tuesti> yess love him
[1:58:59] <%NopeBadguy> I think the intended ending was BD dies getting HK to the factory
[1:59:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> Atton can coast on ex right-wing deathsquad energy
[1:59:01] <%kyh9> Dashing rogue with psychic defenses
[1:59:15] <%wibbwobbler> too many han solos
[1:59:18] <%Irridium> shoot the kids
[1:59:18] <%christopherwpoindexter> such a higher tier than most SW characters ever
[1:59:19] <%Gruhunchously> What about HK?
[1:59:20] <bbblaketwitching> that ending with him... shut up indeed
[1:59:21] <%gatorafan> Think about Pazaak :)
[1:59:26] <bbblaketwitching> atton why
[1:59:26] <%Gruhunchously> Darth T3
[1:59:29] <Joestar1890> HK continuing to be the GOAT
[1:59:31] <mattynezz> Hk with a fucking philosophy
[1:59:32] <memejima> I thought Atton was ACTUALLY gonna be able to kill Sion
[1:59:36] <e3a4> Youtube - KOTOR 2 Cut Content: Sion Versus Nihilus
[1:59:36] <%tuesti> My MAN Cando
[1:59:38] <%DatAsuna> RIP Cando's voice actor btw
[1:59:39] <silverira> +5 to -2
[1:59:41] <Joestar1890> Cando is now MANDO
[1:59:42] <308caliber> For Mandalore! SwiftRage
[1:59:42] <%Gruhunchously> RIP
[1:59:43] <megamirk> rip John Cygan
[1:59:52] <%DatAsuna> John Cygan had a badass voice
[1:59:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @chromdad
[1:59:55] <+HieronymusZephyrinus> rip Solidus Snake
[1:59:55] <phatmac16> DARTH T3
[1:59:55] <subjectg> John cygan was cool, rip
[1:59:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> Cando is so fun, I haven't even played 1 yet!
[2:00:01] <%Gruhunchously> T3 has literally no personality in KOTOR 1
[2:00:07] <memejima> Darth T3
[2:00:09] <olaksi> Didn't Atton die in unmodded or if exile is female? I swear I remember that happening
[2:00:11] <+MidnightBurst12> big plot boy
[2:00:11] <%Irridium> now he's a Darth
[2:00:12] <+therabbles> little did Revan know T3 was rising all along
[2:00:12] <Joestar1890> T3 is now R2 who gets shit DONE
[2:00:13] <%lotharrio> Now I AM R2!
[2:00:18] <%CyanDeadEye> All T3 does plot importance is open a door
[2:00:18] <%DatAsuna> T3 is the MVP
[2:00:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @christopherwpoindexter just remember: do not be fooled by his feats. CANDO IS A MELEE CHARACTER. DO NOT SPEC HIM FOR GUN
[2:00:19] <mattynezz> T3 is a fucking major player now
[2:00:20] <bbblaketwitching> and the sith code
[2:00:22] <%Gruhunchously> @olaksi Atton dies if you lose the fight with Sion
[2:00:23] <Halospaz117> @olaksi Atton dies if he loses to Sion
[2:00:25] <dinnydanny777> T3 has fallen
[2:00:29] <memejima> He actually does what droids do and gets a personality
[2:00:30] <dinnydanny777> T3 is a fallen Jedi
[2:00:30] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:00:32] <bbblaketwitching> yey
[2:00:37] <Joestar1890> You don't knight Sith, V
[2:00:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:38] <%DatAsuna> Knighting him as a darth?
[2:00:42] <%SouLucha> So kotor2 > Kortor1?
[2:00:43] <a_mad_dragon> Kappa
[2:00:46] <Halospaz117> @olaksi It's also the only point in the female exile route that he admits he loves her
[2:00:46] <%Gruhunchously> L I G H T L A T E R
[2:00:49] <chromdad> What about the Pazaak cheater, the true sith?
[2:00:52] <ashenjuan25> My point still stands that the Jedi have always been seen in a critical eye in the OT and the infallibility didn‚Äôt come into play until the PT and why I hold that Star Wars is largely a series of self parody for trying to constantly repeat elements producers think made Star Wars successful hell return of the Jedi is a microcosm of that concept too
[2:00:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> @liquiddinosaur oh yeah, of course! I knew that even as Mandalore
[2:01:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> @christopherwpoindexter hell in Kotor 1 basically nobody should use guns except droids and maybe carth/mission and you will never use Carth/Mission after early game
[2:01:03] <%Gruhunchously> Economic Stability
[2:01:04] <+oda_flobunaga> that MONEY tho
[2:01:09] <phatmac16> please snub Mira
[2:01:16] <+jiggy_snipe> yea he wants stability
[2:01:17] <%Gruhunchously> G0-T0 is Seto Kaiba
[2:01:17] <%razielhex> G0T0 becomes King of the Exchange, right?
[2:01:19] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MONEY
[2:01:19] <%optimasmaximas> @Joestar1890 then what do you do? genuine question cause i think the jedi do that shit?
[2:01:20] <memejima> He loves the republic against his own will
[2:01:21] <%wibbwobbler> what were the gungans up to? ü§î
[2:01:22] <+Aeoneth> Balance to the checkbook
[2:01:22] <mattynezz> G0T0 is cool, because most people won't learn his deal until they are like 4 playthroughs in
[2:01:24] <PraiseHemra> stonks
[2:01:24] <chromdad> Hanharr when
[2:01:25] <bbblaketwitching> oh god, there was a starwars Yugi. I will never forget that now.
[2:01:26] <%christopherwpoindexter> @liquiddinosaur never? wow....
[2:01:28] <%Chatterbox1991> please dont snub mira
[2:01:34] <ashenjuan25> Fuck Mira tho
[2:01:38] <megamirk> who?
[2:01:38] <%ggbhtg> Balance to the check book LUL
[2:01:38] <%Irridium> @Chatterbox1991 they gonna do it
[2:01:43] <%LiquidDinosaur> @christopherwpoindexter i mean Mission's okay if you need a sneaky girl but Carth is the worst
[2:01:43] <+tearfuldevil> the VA for Cando was also the VA for Dash Rendar and Solidus Snake
[2:01:47] <bbblaketwitching> believe in the heart of the pazaak cards
[2:01:48] <%razielhex> The Exchange becomes like the biggest criminal organization outside of the Black Sun and the Cartels
[2:01:54] <mattynezz> "Droids break. In the head"
[2:01:55] <MarkUriah> Mira is just not as interesting she isn't bad
[2:02:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @christopherwpoindexter you bring out Carth to do the plot with his son and when the story forces you
[2:02:04] <ashenjuan25> Yeah she‚Äôs bad
[2:02:05] <%DatAsuna> Mia is fine but she's kotor 1 level
[2:02:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> if, in star wars, the force just manifests whatever your philosophy and personality is, then the core problem with all the factions is that their creeds always override the individual perspectives of their students
[2:02:11] <%Gruhunchously> Mira doens't even get a mention
[2:02:11] <+PlagueOfGripes> basically, they let dogma and brainwashing guide them into extremes rather than developing their own wisdom
[2:02:14] <%MrMoonGoose> Mira could have been cool, maybe.
[2:02:17] <%christopherwpoindexter> @liquiddinosaur then again, everybody has finesse: melee because dexterity fits with strength, I kinda see what you mean, most being melee
[2:02:21] <+senfood> but wait
[2:02:21] <+armor_kuma> And that the whole party theres no one else
[2:02:23] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> LUL
[2:02:23] <neilgilbertg97> Mira?
[2:02:23] <R3c0n31> I hope Woolie watches the cinematic trailers for SWOTOR
[2:02:25] <ashenjuan25> She‚Äôs shown to have massive levels of plot armor that make her presence contrived
[2:02:28] <%MrMoonGoose> Mira = snubbed
[2:02:29] <%christopherwpoindexter> @liquiddinosaur gotcha
[2:02:30] <phatmac16> You skipped Handmaiden?
[2:02:33] <TransDoomGuy> Did Woolie watch the HK-51 speech yet?
[2:02:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @christopherwpoindexter do they HAVE finesse in kotor 1?
[2:02:35] <bbblaketwitching> but destiny manipulation tho
[2:02:36] <Joestar1890> @ashenjuan25 I think it's just a fault of George, trying to make a BIG good in the form of the Jedi, and unintentionally making an unlearning organization that while having the galaxy's best interests, ultimately dooms it by being too stubborn
[2:02:36] <%kyh9> Oh hey Plague
[2:02:39] <chromdad> Whos mira tho
[2:02:39] <%Chatterbox1991> Mira, Woolie
[2:02:40] <%DatAsuna> Visas has great concepts but lacks in execution I think
[2:02:43] <mattynezz> I think The Force is MOSTLY a metaphor for Dogma in KoTOR2
[2:02:46] <%MrMoonGoose> Who?
[2:02:46] <Aussie_Manny> @PlagueOfGripes Scientology. :P
[2:02:51] <%lotharrio> A lot of the characters have wrap ups before the ending, proper.
[2:02:52] <bbblaketwitching> thats kinda a big
[2:02:53] <+senfood> @Chatterbox1991 Who?
[2:02:54] <%Gruhunchously> Visas gets more if you take her with you,, but there's not much incetive to becasue it's so easy to gain influence.
[2:02:55] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Can you guys watch the darkside ending with the characters?
[2:02:57] <phatmac16> A better Attris
[2:03:00] <%razielhex> @PlagueOfGripes Which is how the Eternal Empire of Zakuul was so surprising; they had a completely different way to utilize the Force, with Exarchs using it as a zealotry.
[2:03:01] <+metamyriad> If you get Hanharr, Kreia tells you: "And that is the true lesson of strength: to turn away from strength that is not your own."
[2:03:02] <chromdad> REMOVE MIRA
[2:03:02] <zeow31> @plagueofgripes Problem is that without dogma, force sensitive get easily hooked to the dark side due to basic emotions
[2:03:04] <%christopherwpoindexter> @liquiddinosaur i think dexterity being higher automatically reaches chances to hit in 1?
[2:03:05] <%gatorafan> What a cast of winners. Not a single forgettable character. :)
[2:03:08] <phatmac16> REMOVE MIRA
[2:03:11] <+Deano8817> mira...exists
[2:03:12] <+ntfth> More for Little V than Woolie, but how do you feel about Lucas's "Balance is the absence of the Dark Side"?
[2:03:13] <bbblaketwitching> Mira... who was that?
[2:03:14] <+jiggy_snipe> they could have done something with Mira and Mando since she was a mandolarian slave
[2:03:22] <+armor_kuma> Mira Who?
[2:03:22] <%Gruhunchously> Statement:
[2:03:22] <bbblaketwitching> the miraluka right?
[2:03:25] <Warfey> limesLUL
[2:03:27] <%christopherwpoindexter> I like Mira üòê

[2:03:31] <prime_name> Oh No
[2:03:32] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[2:03:34] <+Deano8817> NO

[2:03:37] <%Chatterbox1991> I LIKE MIRA TOO <3
[2:03:37] <tolloponik> money is gone
[2:03:38] <chromdad> WEW
[2:03:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> So Lucas doesnt believe in the Light Side? Just "Normal" and "Dark?"
[2:03:40] <Halospaz117> V WHY
[2:03:41] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[2:03:42] <%Chatterbox1991> FUCK YALL
[2:03:43] <%Gruhunchously> Wait, is this what I think it is?
[2:03:49] <%christopherwpoindexter> @chatterbox1991 üëèüèªüëèüèª
[2:03:51] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @huskarl_zap
[2:03:53] <MarkUriah> T3 is team Revan
[2:03:55] <memejima> Who gets custody
[2:04:00] <Halospaz117> I feel fear
[2:04:00] <%VCRUZZO> is T3 also sitting on a stool?
[2:04:01] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REVAN
[2:04:01] <dinnydanny777> Well T3 is a Sith
[2:04:04] <%tuesti> revan
[2:04:07] <dinnydanny777> T3 is a Sith
[2:04:07] <bbblaketwitching> who ever had the most recent entry in the series
[2:04:11] <ralphfromdk> You would go to the Exile because of their link skills :D
[2:04:13] <+ntfth> @LiquidDinosaur Within the OT And PT "Light Side" is never said. Its onlt he EU and Disney that it is.
[2:04:13] <tolloponik> exile can eat everything
[2:04:14] <Doodle_Taco> Prob Revan
[2:04:14] <%alrobot2014> hk is ride or die
[2:04:15] <mattynezz> Revan, no doubt
[2:04:15] <+GTCknight> Exile
[2:04:16] <mikash91> Exile got dem force bonds tho
[2:04:20] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur Lucas believes the Light side is just the force and dark side is a perversion, a corruption
[2:04:27] <%lotharrio> @LiquidDinosaur Lucas' canon is that the Force itself is "light side." The Dark Side is an aberration made by people trying to wrap it for their own needs.
[2:04:29] <%Gruhunchously> Revan would assassinate you in an instance
[2:04:31] <+PlagueOfGripes> HK would Stinger through you
[2:04:31] <+armor_kuma> HK fuckin STINGERS over there so fast
[2:04:32] <phatmac16> LOL
[2:04:33] <%MrMoonGoose> Revan would be too much. Like, that dude has seen some shit, I'ma leave him be.
[2:04:34] <308caliber> lmfao
[2:04:37] <%Chatterbox1991> MIRA
[2:04:38] <+diabetofett> Anybody Tell Woolie how Meetra gets screwed over later when they find Revan
[2:04:39] <+therabbles> HK could not get to revan fast enough
[2:04:41] <chromdad> Both serve T3
[2:04:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> now...for all the haters, you could go dark side, take Nar Shaddaa first planet, then be light side the rest of the game once you unlock Hanharr
[2:04:43] <%shadowsofpain> Due to force bonds Exile it would be impossible not to
[2:04:46] <%wibbwobbler> hk is def going for sss
[2:04:48] <%razielhex> @Gruhunchously Revan's a punk bitch.
[2:04:52] <ashenjuan25> Yeah I feel a lot of Lucas‚Äôs influences post empire strikes back is what helped ruined the franchise
[2:04:57] <R3c0n31> OH BOI, HE GONNA WATCH IT
[2:05:00] <Joestar1890> Time for a history lesson, chat!
[2:05:00] <bbblaketwitching> NOTHING WRONG

[2:05:05] <TDAWS_MP132> NOOOOOO
[2:05:06] <prince_johnny_> Uh oh
[2:05:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> in Kotor 1 cant you just straight up be good/evil and then change sides at the roof of the temple?
[2:05:07] <megamirk> its ogre
[2:05:08] <prime_name> TIME 4 BOOK
[2:05:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> WE DUN DID IT
[2:05:13] <%MrMoonGoose> HOES MAD
[2:05:14] <Archmortal> WHY MUST HE RUIN IT FOR HIMSELF
[2:05:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> a lot of supplementals to watch now
[2:05:14] <ashenjuan25> And I feel Lucas gets far far too much credit for the first two movies too
[2:05:17] <%krispen_wa> DOOOOON'T DO IT
[2:05:18] <zeow31> @christopherwpoindexter Or install a mod that lets you choose...Light side Hanharr is wild
[2:05:21] <IcyTvTuber> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:05:23] <TransDoomGuy> When's the HK-51 speech?
[2:05:23] <%brachydios777> You can not stop it chat
[2:05:25] <%christopherwpoindexter> i hate how the exile is treated later (novel, MMO), but i still love calling her a her, Meetra Surik represent
[2:05:27] <+ondri21> OOO WE WATCHIN THE VIDEOS
[2:05:27] <subjectg> So Halo LP when
[2:05:27] <PaulToon1990> I was wondering if you'd bring that up.
[2:05:28] <%DatAsuna> I got video of that too @WoolieVersus
[2:05:29] <%shadowsofpain> Time to watch Asunas Magnum Opis
[2:05:31] <huskarl_zap> Darth Vitamins is now
[2:05:31] <%sonofthedeepsouth> PREACH V
[2:05:32] <bbblaketwitching> as shit, here we go again
[2:05:34] <mattynezz> That scene is VERY different
[2:05:36] <MarkUriah> SWOTOR IS INEVITABLE
[2:05:38] <%razielhex> An entire shipment of HK-51s crash landed in Belsavis heading for the Empire; like.. a shipment of thousands.
[2:05:39] <%Gruhunchously> That is also a good scene. Both versions of the Enclave scene are amazing.
[2:05:44] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus the dark side of enclave is start of the endgame one
[2:05:45] <+tearfuldevil> @christopherwpoindexter meetra surik is a good name
[2:05:49] <+Freeborg23> Atton's death?
[2:05:51] <KiddKame> So...... Kreia and Handmaiden connection?
[2:05:51] <IcyTvTuber> SwToR iS a BaD gAmE
[2:05:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @christopherwpoindexter i'll finally play Female Exile now that i know there's a mod that gives you handmaiden
[2:05:57] <bbblaketwitching> eh. yey
[2:06:01] <%wibbwobbler> swotor watch party?
[2:06:03] <%krispen_wa> NOOOO NOT SWTOR
[2:06:04] <%optimasmaximas> yea lol
[2:06:04] <chromdad> You have failed me, utterly and completely
[2:06:04] <%DatAsuna> Yeah it's for off-air time
[2:06:06] <phatmac16> yup
[2:06:08] <Halospaz117> I still love Deceived
[2:06:08] <+MidnightBurst12> facts
[2:06:09] <PraiseHemra> yup
[2:06:13] <IcyTvTuber> silence blind angered ones
[2:06:14] <%MrMoonGoose> HOES MAD HOES MAD HOES MAD
[2:06:15] <%CEGold> As someone who LOVES SWTOR, yeah the cinematics are the best thing about it
[2:06:16] <R3c0n31> Facts, and i like the MMO
[2:06:19] <%VCRUZZO> Yeah do that yourself buddy
[2:06:19] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur Female exile is worth it just for the relationship with Sion
[2:06:20] <%DatAsuna> Deceived is fantastic
[2:06:20] <phatmac16> THOSE TRAILERS BLEW MY MIND
[2:06:21] <mattynezz> If it didn't do the Revan retcon, I would agree
[2:06:21] <ashenjuan25> Those cinematic are the best thing about the game
[2:06:21] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> You should watch the dark side endings
[2:06:22] <IcyTvTuber> hoes mad 3: chat time
[2:06:22] <%brachydios777> Swtor trailers Kreygasm
[2:06:24] <Joestar1890> Cinematics are GREAT
[2:06:26] <%krispen_wa> the cutscenes are good
[2:06:28] <%christopherwpoindexter> @tearfuldevil same, I hate how Meetra is treated later, but I love naming the Exile that, any gender, in every playthrough from now on
[2:06:30] <%Irridium> I wish those class quests were their own games
[2:06:31] <%spiritofmojave> yeah cinematic trailers are tight least
[2:06:32] <ashenjuan25> Make an animated movie like that
[2:06:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @zeow31 oh sure, it makes him an even bigger simp
[2:06:34] <redamber1> No
[2:06:37] <startstoprepeat> cipher nine is the best thing about swtor
[2:06:38] <$Fortunato5678> Those were made by Blur, right?
[2:06:39] <%wibbwobbler> yessss
[2:06:42] <%VCRUZZO> Those trailers are fucking dope!
[2:06:43] <+diabetofett> The Jedi Knight plot line of Swtor is so good
[2:06:43] <%CEGold> The game is ok. The trailers are FANTASTIC
[2:06:47] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah those trailers are fantastic
[2:06:48] <R3c0n31> SWOTOR Trailers are fantastic, why dont we fund those sectors?
[2:06:49] <+HollowMan190> oh by far
[2:06:49] <%razielhex> BLUR studios is so goddamned good
[2:06:54] <bbblaketwitching> not one single thing wrong
[2:06:59] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MEMES
[2:06:59] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur It makes him King of the Simps, it's kinda hilarious
[2:07:02] <%kyh9> KOTET and KOTFE are pretty decent
[2:07:05] <%Gruhunchously> You can see exactly where that billion dollar budget went
[2:07:05] <chromdad> Trailers that define ‚Äúbetter than the game‚Äù
[2:07:06] <%razielhex> Bioware contracted a great company to do those trailers
[2:07:06] <%DatAsuna> This studio also did the sonic movie. lol
[2:07:09] <mattynezz> Oh, the CINEMATIC trailers, yeah, those are great
[2:07:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @zeow31 Dark Lord of the Simp
[2:07:12] <bbblaketwitching> did nothing
[2:07:16] <%brachydios777> BLUR also did the halo 2 anniversary cutscenes

[2:07:50] <%kyh9> @sonofthedeepsouth The best part is meeting him and the Sith realizing he had another fmaily that he likes way more

[2:08:00] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur its implied a bit less hevaily, but you can reeed it either way
[2:08:00] <Archmortal> that's also like at least 8 hours of pausing during dialogue choices to discuss the dialogue

[2:11:42] <%spiritofmojave> @christopherwpoindexter latessss
[2:11:43] <%Neoepochx> @Freeborg23 That is not even close to correct for the ranking.
[2:11:43] <chromdad> Dr Cortex better be the smash character
[2:11:45] <%DatAsuna> but job stuff
[2:11:49] <mattynezz> @WoolieVersus Did you also get LS Revan content?
[2:11:49] <+tearfuldevil> eh, woolie doesn't do that based on what he's said
[2:11:53] <startstoprepeat> you have no fucking idea
[2:11:56] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia is SO pissed
[2:11:57] <%Irridium> Oh Dark Side is a fucking TRIP
[2:11:57] <%Neoepochx> Especially if you consider writing.
[2:11:58] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> You should at least see the DS endings
[2:12:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> SHE'S LIKE "YOU'RE A FUCKING LOSER"
[2:12:07] <wowowinsane> DarkSydeExile
[2:12:15] <memejima> ‚ÄúTHIS IS WHAT WE WANTED TO AVOID‚Äù
[2:12:20] <huskarl_zap> the.council makes.no sense if the masters die
[2:12:22] <chromdad> You dumby exile
[2:12:23] <+Reaviar> she left those losers only to find another loser
[2:12:23] <prime_name> Dark Side Exile is just Sion 2.0 for Kriea
[2:12:23] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia just RIPs into you in the end about how much of an idiot you are.
[2:12:42] <%Irridium> unrelated Planescape Torment is SO fucking good
[2:12:42] <furcifer93> This was quite the ride. From Woolie thinking Granny was a cranky Obi-Wan to now.
[2:12:45] <ralphfromdk> And now you know why people love Obsidian games so much
[2:12:45] <zeow31> @prime_name More like Nihilus 2.0 but yeah
[2:12:46] <dinnydanny777> This is why if you're not a confident writer you should make a linear game
[2:12:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> @cegold @brachydios777 @spiritofmojave likewise @woolieversus I JUST PLAYED THAT LAST NIGHT YOU WILL LOVE IT Now I know where the "failed me completely and utterly" quote is from
[2:12:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> Fann Y'Pakk is legitimately the closest possible thing to what Kreia actually wants
[2:12:57] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> the funny thing about a dark side exile is that it never occurs to Kreia that considering all her pupils turned dark side that maybe there's something wrong with HER.
[2:13:04] <KaiserMario> There's also fem-exile and simp-sion?
[2:13:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Rich_In_Antioxidants Kreia would NEVER think that EVER
[2:13:19] <%wibbwobbler> were we kreia the whole time?!?
[2:13:27] <memejima> Is this gonna be on Youtube?
[2:13:28] <chromdad> [truth] vs [lie] options
[2:13:46] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> which goes back to what the council did where they never admitted that they were the underlying problem
[2:13:54] <%shadowsofpain> More like the worst part of both Sion and Nihilus
[2:14:00] <zeow31> @liquiddinosaur I mean, there is a lot of self hatred in her philosophy, I feel like her pupils going dark side is part of it
[2:14:02] <keiji_maede> And now play dragon age
[2:14:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> also why I want to a be video game writer, writer in general. also my name is Christopher, coincidence? imagine Mario, Sonic, many mainstream game franchises having dialogue boss battles, multiple paths, non-linearity, ANYHOW ok bye for real
[2:14:08] <huskarl_zap> wtf did you dow load?
[2:14:10] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SWTOR COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD
[2:14:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BUT NO
[2:14:18] <TheAdMerlin> Yeah, we need a trilogy LP of Dragon Age
[2:14:20] <TDAWS_MP132> time for pain

[2:14:26] <%SmoothEnigma> SWTOR IS GOOD U FOOL
[2:14:27] <%Irridium> I just really wish it wasn't an MMO
[2:14:27] <memejima> Was SWTOR THAT FAR AFTER?
[2:14:29] <%Gruhunchously> The ABOMINATION
[2:14:31] <+tearfuldevil> @TheAdMerlin not happening for 100 dollars
[2:14:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @zeow31 i think that she acknowledges she's a hypocrite and she thinks that means she's actually unassailable but she like, underestimates how much of a hypocrite she is
[2:14:33] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> V and Woolie playing dragon age
[2:14:34] <+r_Foeburden87> sWTOR is super good
[2:14:35] <+deadeyemax> SWTOR sucks
[2:14:36] <Halospaz117> I like SWTOR
[2:14:38] <%SmoothEnigma> YALL JUST HAVE NO TASTE
[2:14:39] <JackalKing> I actually really liked SWTOR.
[2:14:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:14:40] <%VCRUZZO> swtor is fine
[2:14:41] <+Exicuren> Mass Effect 3 LP, please?
[2:14:42] <+ondri21> i like swtor
[2:14:43] <%optimasmaximas> BabyRage
[2:14:43] <montgomerynw> SWTOR is fine. It's not great. It's good
[2:14:44] <%Gruhunchously> ME3 is the worst on though
[2:14:44] <%MrMoonGoose> SWTOR if great.
[2:14:45] <%Irridium> nah that's Andromeda
[2:14:47] <wowowinsane> swtor is bad and so is me3
[2:14:47] <phatmac16> SWTOR sucks
[2:14:47] <thebalticguy1> SWTOR is fine
[2:14:48] <mattynezz> ME3 is better than SWTOR though
[2:14:49] <ralphfromdk> It's an okay mmo, it just hurts that we didn't get Kotor3 instead.
[2:14:50] <akman14> ME2 is the worst in the trilogy
[2:14:50] <Saivryn> The problem is that it is fine
[2:14:50] <+ondri21> not worth if you dont like mmos
[2:14:52] <%Chatterbox1991> MASS EFFECT 3 IS THE WORST THO YOU DONT REMEMBER
[2:14:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @zeow31 or she thinks ackowledging shes a hypocrite makes it ok
[2:14:54] <+Exicuren> sorry, Mass Effect Trilogy LP, please?
[2:14:54] <+RowenCleric> is SWTOR worth picking it up just to play LS Sith or something V?
[2:14:54] <chromdad> Swtor we coulda been kotor 2 but u playin
[2:14:55] <%CyanDeadEye> SWTOR is fine, but the callbacks to KOTOR are lacking imo
[2:14:56] <%wibbwobbler> its aight. couldn't stick with it
[2:14:56] <%spiritofmojave> It's just ok, everyone out here exaggerating LUL
[2:14:57] <%CEGold> I love SWTOR's Sith Warrior story so much.
[2:14:57] <Zouledge> swtor has ups and downs but i will never agree on what they did with revan
[2:14:57] <Safarihat> its only fine
[2:14:58] <%SmoothEnigma> HOES B MAD AT SWTOR
[2:14:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BUT I WANT IT
[2:15:00] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> my plastic bonsai tree is also fine
[2:15:01] <Doodle_Taco> Hard disagree
[2:15:01] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR is fine if you ignote thr KOTOR II parts
[2:15:01] <Halospaz117> I like the Bounty Hunter, it's cool
[2:15:02] <Zap_Rowsdower32> I will hate SWTOR for what it did to The Exile and you can't sway me
[2:15:03] <%R3Roundabout> Little V, professional apologist
[2:15:03] <zeow31> SWTOR is awful... It destroys Revan, the Exile and the empire is a parody of the Dark side
[2:15:03] <theredfox930000> me3 is bad
[2:15:04] <memejima> I haven‚Äôt really seen anything of SWTOR so besides all of chats sayings, I‚Äôm blind
[2:15:04] <KaiserMario> ME 3 is really bad tho, certainly the worst of the 3
[2:15:05] <%MrMoonGoose> It's not KOTOR 3 levels, but it's a good game
[2:15:05] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I WANT KOTOR 2 AGAIN
[2:15:06] <Archmortal> SWTOR is fine if you play the right class and ignore everything having to do with Revan
[2:15:06] <CommanderBrocken> Swtor is hit and miss
[2:15:07] <%brachydios777> You can‚Äôt say 3 is the worst after andromeda
[2:15:09] <+Reaviar> swtor is fine but the only stories i like are the sith warrior and imperial agent
[2:15:12] <%tuesti> yes
[2:15:12] <huskarl_zap> ME3 is factually the least in quality until andromeda
[2:15:12] <Robot_Nixon_> alyx was good tho
[2:15:15] <%krispen_wa> ME3 sucks tho
[2:15:18] <snakemuho> Andromeda doesn't make 3 better
[2:15:19] <olaksi> ME3 is embarrassing, the ending is a minor part of that
[2:15:19] <%jase__x> thats the legend of Korra
[2:15:19] <mattynezz> I don't think SWTOR is even KoTOR1
[2:15:21] <ShyDispatch> Swtor is pretty good, except for any of the parts that touch kotor 1 and 2. Those parts are trash, but everything else that it does for itself is good.
[2:15:22] <+EvilGeek0013> Not even KOTOR 2 was allowed to be KOTOR 2
[2:15:22] <+oda_flobunaga> AaAAAaaaAaA SwOToR iS a CrImE AgaInSt HumAnItY !1!1!!
[2:15:23] <+Freeborg23> It will, I believe
[2:15:24] <Zouledge> @krispen_wa which is easy as they isnt many
[2:15:25] <+ChopmanFGC> it's funny because swtor and me3 are actually both terrible lmao
[2:15:25] <tolloponik> wait if SWOTR is almost 300 years later then how is reven still alive?
[2:15:27] <ralphfromdk> Best part of SWtor is the Taris aftermath about the Promised land
[2:15:28] <thealientrilogy> SWTOR's good, apart from anything that touches on KOTOR 1/2.
[2:15:30] <%razielhex> SWTOR is Revan canonical because it was written by the original people.
[2:15:31] <+metamyriad> Obsidian games follow on from this sort of story very well, especially Tyranny
[2:15:37] <%Irridium> @tolloponik The Force‚Ñ¢
[2:15:38] <Saivryn> It's just too mediocre, but there potentially could've been a third game which ends the story directly, even I've thought a lot about possible endings and there's plenty to do especially now since canon is shaken up
[2:15:39] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Revan is like frozen
[2:15:40] <%christopherwpoindexter> I think it's more because of how Revan and Meetra Surik are treated, not SWTOR on its own, but I never played it so.....
[2:15:40] <Rixstarian> @brachydios777 Andromeda is an isolated bag of garbage
[2:15:40] <%DatAsuna> Just intro trailers
[2:15:42] <zeow31> @tolloponik Bullshit Dark side powerq
[2:15:42] <%razielhex> @tolloponik Because Emperor Vitiate wanted him to stay alive.
[2:15:43] <%wibbwobbler> yesssss
[2:15:43] <ralphfromdk> tolloponik The force does fucky things :p
[2:15:44] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> @tolloponik the videos will explain I think
[2:15:45] <montgomerynw> Revan was basically put in stasis. More complicated but yeah
[2:15:46] <%MrMoonGoose> @tolloponik stasis
[2:15:49] <%CyanDeadEye> @tolloponik Stasis tank
[2:15:49] <mattynezz> @tolloponik Evil Emperor man kicked his ass and stasis field prisoned him
[2:15:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> I sent you what you need for the SWOTOR novels months ago
[2:15:54] <Ids560> I can't believe SWTOR broke the geneva conventions and kicked my grandma down the stairs
[2:15:54] <%krispen_wa> @zouledge their treatment of the exile is MORE THAN ENOUGH to make me a mad ho
[2:15:55] <%optimasmaximas> D:
[2:15:56] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LONG AGO IN A DISTANT LAND
[2:15:57] <Archmortal> @razielhex really makes you wonder how writers missed the point of their own character so hard
[2:15:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YES
[2:16:01] <%Irridium> oh I thought it was just the force like with Yoda

[2:16:29] <%razielhex> @Archmortal I think they got the point exactly. Revan was always a fanatical zealot that fell in love with his own legend.
[2:16:30] <+r_Foeburden87> This si that good shit
[2:16:32] <%optimasmaximas> these look cool at least

[2:16:58] <%DukeBlack_> oh shit i remember this
[2:16:59] <%razielhex> This isn't the right order
[2:16:59] <%kyh9> Zakuul vs Republic vs Empire would have been interesting
[2:17:03] <usurper_sos> Babealore
[2:17:03] <%spiritofmojave> FOR MANDALORE

[2:17:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Deano8817 split personality?
[2:17:10] <%Neoepochx> The trailers for this game were so good, too bad the MMO was pretty generic.
[2:17:11] <jaygee303> MALGUS IS THE SHIT
[2:17:14] <mattynezz> The Mandos joining the Empire is also fucked.
[2:17:15] <%Irridium> fuckin' Steve the Jedi here
[2:17:18] <%razielhex> THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT ORDER
[2:17:19] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL

[2:18:53] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:18:53] <CodeSodaboi> The actual worst thing about SWTOR is you can't side with Malgus at all
[2:18:53] <dadeaner> best choreography in any sw media in these trailers
[2:18:55] <%sonofthedeepsouth> F

[2:19:14] <tolloponik> man I remember seeing these in middle school and so disappointed in the in game graphics
[2:19:16] <usurper_sos> Should have read the frame data boi
[2:19:16] <%kyh9> This game honestly has some great Sith Lords: MArr, Malgus, Acina, Vitiate

[2:19:19] <%spiritofmojave> HOOD UP
[2:19:22] <huskarl_zap> The sith didn't control coursaunt in swtor

[2:19:24] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MALGUS DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:19:28] <+PlagueOfGripes> Malgus fucking hates everyone
[2:19:29] <Zouledge> @CodeSodaboi not to spoil it but you kinda can later on since they brought him back
[2:19:30] <huskarl_zap> did they?
[2:19:31] <%razielhex> We're going backwards
[2:19:31] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> Why couldn't the game be as cool as the cutscenes?
[2:19:32] <+Reaviar> malgus was so badass
[2:19:33] <%gatorafan> @kekkerscrew, no
[2:19:34] <%illtima> The best trailer!

[2:25:26] <+PlagueOfGripes> he has a lot of names
[2:25:29] <GilliamYaeger> Having played through about 20 levels of it, TOR is fine but it's not what I'd call 'good'. Writing is clumsy with occasional nuggets of good (ie Agent, Inquisitor). Gameplay is absolutely awful, especially when coming off something like FFXIV. The way multiplayer instanced dungeons were handled was super neato though.
[2:25:29] <%Gruhunchously> Mao, huh?
[2:25:29] <+Hinasil> Bae-O Dur is his name
[2:25:30] <snakemuho> Mayo-dude

[2:30:49] <Doodle_Taco> Now for the bummers
[2:30:51] <ShyDispatch> The KOTFE trailers are legit the best
[2:30:51] <Bruno_Tropical> Watch the brothers trailer
[2:30:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> considering the plot takes place over a thousand years.......
[2:30:53] <%DatAsuna> This is post timeskip
[2:30:53] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SECOND POG
[2:30:54] <%VCRUZZO> that is the question
[2:30:56] <%DatAsuna> Big timeskip
[2:30:57] <SuperChumps> PLAY SWTOR
[2:31:01] <%optimasmaximas> brothers trailer? pls BibleThump
[2:31:02] <+Vijuani> SHOW FALLEN EMPIRE
[2:31:02] <tolloponik> is swotor still subscription based?
[2:31:06] <aiutare47> Woolie afraid of showing that homework folder I see.
[2:31:06] <%krispen_wa> nevermind it let me kill Kaliyo, it wasn't TOTALLY a mistake
[2:31:08] <%DatAsuna> Well the third
[2:31:09] <%Ashenik1> Are we going to talk about the Revan book?
[2:31:10] <thealientrilogy> Guys! FALLEN EMPIRE THO
[2:31:17] <+cvp5127> is swtor still updated?
[2:31:19] <%Neoepochx> From Dromun Kass
[2:31:22] <%DatAsuna> @cvp5127 yes
[2:31:25] <CommanderBrocken> just had a new expac
[2:31:26] <%christopherwpoindexter> wow, this is weird, I have ZERO connotation for any of this
[2:31:30] <%DatAsuna> The COLD WAR
[2:31:31] <%sonofthedeepsouth> THE SACK OF CORUSCANT
[2:31:31] <Halospaz117> Cold War
[2:31:32] <+Deano8817> @tolloponik kind of, you sub once and keep all the new story content
[2:31:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> CAUSE
[2:31:38] <montgomerynw> The Empire was overextended but the Republic was too beaten to fight back
[2:31:40] <Joestar1890> @cvp5127 yeah, there's still support from EA
[2:31:41] <%kyh9> The Emperor gets bored, no really, HE GETS BORED
[2:31:42] <%DatAsuna> I love cold wars
[2:31:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> weird in a good way
[2:31:56] <tolloponik> alright cool @Deano8817
[2:31:57] <%sonofthedeepsouth> CAUSE REASONS
[2:32:06] <%razielhex> The ceasefire is literally because of a mind-meld between Revan and the Sith Emperor Vitiate. They corrupted each other's minds and Revan convinced the Emperor to stop the war to save the Republic.
[2:32:06] <Halospaz117> Also the Male Jedi Knight is David Hayter
[2:32:07] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Star Wars: Cold Wars
[2:32:10] <+Deano8817> but muh sith warrior tho
[2:32:16] <+MidnightBurst12> Star wars's plot seems like what happens when you try to introduce scale to a timeline without any real logic
[2:32:16] <%Irridium> muh Agent
[2:32:17] <Archmortal> Sith Warrior is better honestly
[2:32:17] <%NopeBadguy> @Halospaz117 ARE YOU FOR FUCKING REAL
[2:32:26] <%GrassCannon> Dromund Kaas
[2:32:27] <$NoWayRyanTatum> LIGHT SIDE SITH WARRIOR THO
[2:32:28] <%krispen_wa> and the female jedi knight has a sexy voice
[2:32:29] <Halospaz117> @NopeBadguy Yes, he's doing his regular voice tho

[2:35:55] <huskarl_zap> $47 lol
[2:35:56] <redamber1> that sounds really dumb
[2:35:59] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Jedi knight gets T7 who's a good boy
[2:36:00] <huskarl_zap> I like that
[2:36:00] <+cvp5127> LUL
[2:36:01] <+Nothing_Wild> Scourge is a turd.
[2:36:02] <ralphfromdk> They do them dirty
[2:36:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sounds like horseshit.
[2:36:03] <%Neoepochx> Convinces him that they are "overextending"
[2:36:04] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Revan and the emperor have a force bond mind war thing
[2:36:05] <%MrMoonGoose> HK $47
[2:36:06] <%Gruhunchously> Strategic genius acts like a first time D&D party.
[2:36:08] <TDAWS_MP132> It's SUPER DUMB
[2:36:09] <+BioHunter> not a great ending at all
[2:36:11] <KaiserMario> Revan has a mental battle to keep the Emperor from winning
[2:36:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> Rich_evans.jpg
[2:36:12] <%GrassCannon> Revan got Worfed basically
[2:36:12] <Zouledge> oh it gets so much worse post vanilla story
[2:36:13] <Archmortal> I have an idea. Let's make SWTOR non-canon, and make a good KOTOR 3
[2:36:13] <%SouLucha> I am no impressed.
[2:36:14] <SuperChumps> There is more to it
[2:36:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> SHOULDA BROUGHT DA CREW
[2:36:17] <%christopherwpoindexter> MY HEADCANON, the real events of KOTOR 3 have the real Revan and Meetra, the ones in the Revan novel and TOR are clones/fakes
[2:36:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BDSM Sparda
[2:36:21] <$Futurecity10> light side reven btw
[2:36:22] <TheAdMerlin> Revan is also a raid boss for a cross faction raid. So your player character and bros beat Revan and HK
[2:36:23] <+MidnightBurst12> Anticlimactic as fuck
[2:36:24] <huskarl_zap> then it gets worse
[2:36:24] <Joestar1890> Scourge does not deserve to lounge in my ship
[2:36:25] <%Gruhunchously> The Exile in the Revan novel is not the Exile
[2:36:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> OOF
[2:36:30] <+Hollow_Mirage> So basically MMOs suck the life out of things
[2:36:31] <%SouLucha> Oh but it's a fun game, eh? Yeah no fuck it.
[2:36:31] <%DatAsuna> Clones is even worse, dude
[2:36:32] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Exile and T3 die. Rich Evans laugh.gif
[2:36:32] <ralphfromdk> V, do you remember the Taris promised land story line? D:
[2:36:33] <%Neoepochx> WHAT A SHOCK
[2:36:36] <+PlagueOfGripes> """betrays"""
[2:36:40] <%razielhex> Emperor Vitiate transcends power.
[2:36:40] <JetpackMcQuack> The exile has superhuman persuasion though
[2:36:41] <Bruno_Tropical> DMC Sparda
[2:36:41] <mattynezz> T3 gets blown up with Force Lightning
[2:36:44] <%spiritofmojave> Lightside Revan who is now CANON only male and generic looking :I
[2:36:44] <%krispen_wa> My headcanon is that the Jedi Knight is the Exile with memory loss
[2:36:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> the book
[2:36:46] <thealientrilogy> THE EXILE'S CHARACTER GETS RUINED
[2:36:50] <%VCRUZZO> the book
[2:36:52] <Archmortal> it was a force vision, which AS WE ALL KNOW NEVER GO WELL
[2:36:52] <Halospaz117> The awful awful Revan book
[2:36:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> I gave you the book
[2:36:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> @jetpackmcquack tell that to Drew
[2:36:57] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus You meet the sith who betrayed him
[2:36:58] <%Gruhunchously> Sorry.....Meetra Surik
[2:36:58] <%razielhex> Lord Scourge ruins people's shit. He's great.
[2:37:02] <Airtighttrash> The book is so bad
[2:37:02] <%krispen_wa> and that's why vitiate is so interested in the JK
[2:37:03] <%DatAsuna> Yes
[2:37:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> It's not awful, just not great
[2:37:08] <%Neoepochx> @Halospaz117 Makes me nuts that Drew wrote that.
[2:37:10] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the book sucks
[2:37:11] <Nekros4442> Both Lightside
[2:37:13] <+Nothing_Wild> At least Revan has living descendants. The Exile doesn‚Äôt have any, canonically.
[2:37:13] <%DSD24> Isn't the Exile's canon name Meetra Sulik or something?
[2:37:13] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus both light
[2:37:14] <Doodle_Taco> @woolieversus That girl you saw is Revan's grandaughter, I think
[2:37:15] <IcyTvTuber> Revan Expansion
[2:37:17] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Canon Exile is female both are light side
[2:37:19] <+r_Foeburden87> well Light grey
[2:37:21] <memejima> This sounds really BAD for exile and revans characters
[2:37:22] <+Benergizer1> The book was written by the head writer of Kotor I, who had no idea how to write the Exile, so yeah.
[2:37:25] <Airtighttrash> Bioware shits on the Exile
[2:37:27] <+Deano8817> Kotor 2 gets fucked and I hate it
[2:37:28] <ShyDispatch> The entirety of kotor 2 gets dirtied.
[2:37:28] <%Ashenik1> It s a fine book but ending is bullshit
[2:37:28] <prime_name> Male Revan, Female Exile
[2:37:29] <mattynezz> Male Lightside Revan, Female Lightside Exile
[2:37:29] <%Gruhunchously> HOW DOES SHE FORCE GHOST?
[2:37:30] <%razielhex> SWTOR Book is 3.6/5. Not great, but not terrible.
[2:37:30] <Zouledge> the revan book is not good from what ive heard, shame cuz the same guy wrote the bane trilogy which is awesome
[2:37:31] <%optimasmaximas> @spiritofmojave does revan being a girl make the character more interesting? genuinely asking, dont know if somethings are different based on gender
[2:37:31] <%wibbwobbler> wreck past heroes to prop up new ones. modern star wars blows
[2:37:32] <Joestar1890> Yeah
[2:37:36] <tolloponik> BioWare hated Kotor 2
[2:37:37] <R3c0n31> Was it Cannon? i always thought Revan was dark side
[2:37:37] <phatmac16> Bioware shits on Exile
[2:37:37] <Doodle_Taco> Yep
[2:37:39] <Nekros4442> They do alot of stupid shit with Revan
[2:37:41] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Exile's real name
[2:37:42] <JetpackMcQuack> This poor, poor franchise
[2:37:43] <%Neoepochx> Because Lucasfilm didn't like the concepts thrown around Kotor 2
[2:37:43] <+tearfuldevil> @optimasmaximas not really
[2:37:43] <%krispen_wa> FUCK THE REVAN NOVEL
[2:37:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> How can the Exile be a Force Ghost if she's a Force Wound
[2:37:47] <+Quarkee> Wait, can the exile be a force ghost?
[2:37:47] <GilliamYaeger> Force ghost hole in the force
[2:37:47] <Halospaz117> YEP
[2:37:49] <%kyh9> Shadow of Revan is okay
[2:37:49] <+PlagueOfGripes> Revan lives for a very very long time
[2:37:50] <Doodle_Taco> YEP
[2:37:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> they're fake clones, my head canon. the real Revan and Exile do a lot of stuff in the KOTOR 3
[2:37:57] <%krispen_wa> shadow of revan is dumb
[2:37:58] <%razielhex> Surik is a ghost in Taral V
[2:37:59] <knotsundownsyndrome> revan's a few fights
[2:37:59] <%Gruhunchously> How can the Exile be a ghost?
[2:37:59] <Jmann9218> Revan is a Boss for Empire Characters
[2:38:00] <%kyh9> Exile shows up a couple of times
[2:38:03] <ht109> bio be jelly
[2:38:06] <%kyh9> Bioware salty how good Exile is
[2:38:06] <%krispen_wa> Revan is a fucking dumbass in that expansion
[2:38:06] <+jjjkopf> nuh uh my OC emperor is SUPER DUPER STRONG and beats them
[2:38:08] <mattynezz> Revan is alive. Then alive and a ghost
[2:38:09] <Joestar1890> Revan gets force ghosted too
[2:38:10] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus The exile is guiding scourge to work her agenda behind the scenes
[2:38:10] <+Nothing_Wild> @neoepochx There is some immense irony in that.
[2:38:10] <%SouLucha> So you mean this isn't the first time a Star Wars Sequel ruins the last thing?
[2:38:10] <%VCRUZZO> it does them dirty
[2:38:10] <%christopherwpoindexter> *the Revan novel ones are clones, my head canon, tbh
[2:38:12] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Bastila comes back as a ghost too
[2:38:13] <%spiritofmojave> @optimasmaximas mean not totally no, but canon deciding how someone looks seems a bit stupid to me, it's better left ambigious imo
[2:38:13] <Doodle_Taco> They ruin all the cool themes set up in the previous games
[2:38:17] <%DSD24> If she is cut off from the force how come she is a Ghost
[2:38:17] <%razielhex> You kill Revan three times. It's great.
[2:38:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> light side Revan is an idiot
[2:38:19] <BlueMoonBlues> It's honestly like nobody at Bioware played or gave a single shit about Kotor 2
[2:38:27] <Jmann9218> Tell Woolie about the Sith Revan Cult

[2:38:38] <%krispen_wa> IGNORE IT ALL
[2:38:38] <+BioHunter> traaaassshhh
[2:38:38] <+r_Foeburden87> yeah i missed that...
[2:38:39] <Halospaz117> IT IS
[2:38:39] <TDAWS_MP132> IT'S SOOOOO DUMB
[2:38:40] <Doodle_Taco> KH TRASH
[2:38:41] <KnivesEve> wow
[2:38:41] <DeathByPoke7> Kinddom hearts
[2:38:42] <prince_johnny_> jesus
[2:38:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @LiquidDinosaur
[2:38:43] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Dark side has revan being genocidal
[2:38:44] <%optimasmaximas> @tearfuldevil @spiritofmojave ah ok, thanks
[2:38:45] <%Gruhunchously> It's really bad
[2:38:45] <neilgilbertg97> Have you guys watch the twins trailer
[2:38:46] <+oda_flobunaga> That is some Naruto level shit
[2:38:46] <liljojofett> Revan is a raid boss
[2:38:46] <%kyh9> And then the Emperor killed them all
[2:38:47] <+cvp5127> vanitas?
[2:38:48] <ZeeJiggle> And then Vergil gets split-
[2:38:49] <startstoprepeat> i literally forgot about all of this, it's great, highly recommend
[2:38:50] <%SouLucha> What happens to HK?
[2:38:50] <%MrMoonGoose> Yeah, the Revan parts of SWTOR are kinda....
[2:38:52] <+MidnightBurst12> Absolute garbage
[2:38:53] <+MagicBeanBurrito> you get to fight HK as dark side!
[2:38:53] <%Neoepochx> @WoolieVersus The KotOR comics are pretty good....
[2:38:54] <ShyDispatch> It really is just everything that touches kotor 1 and 2 that's bad in swtor. When it does it's own thing, it's not conflicting with anything and is allowed to be pretty good.
[2:38:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> this is not the real Revan and Exile, these are fake clones to make the Sith complacent
[2:39:00] <FirewallStorm> would the Exile be the strongest
[2:39:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:39:03] <memejima> As a kingdom hearts fan. THAT IS SOME KINGDOM HEARTS BS
[2:39:03] <ashenjuan25> Fan fic
[2:39:04] <+jjjkopf> mullet revan
[2:39:04] <%DSD24> Big Generic Face
[2:39:04] <%Ashenik1> dont ruin it for him !!!!!
[2:39:04] <%krispen_wa> He looks like Keanu reeves with hair loss
[2:39:04] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Reva's Heart was taken
[2:39:05] <%DatAsuna> Show him the keanu reeves edit lol
[2:39:06] <KaiserMario> Canon Revan is just LittleV
[2:39:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> Revan is Mullet-Man
[2:39:06] <+oda_flobunaga> generic white dude face
[2:39:07] <%CyanDeadEye> Revan got all his gear back
[2:39:07] <%christopherwpoindexter> i want to believe
[2:39:07] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HHAHA
[2:39:08] <+PlagueOfGripes> he "reclaims" the mask
[2:39:10] <%sonofthedeepsouth> YES
[2:39:11] <%Irridium> yeah it looks cool why wouldn't you
[2:39:11] <%spiritofmojave> YEP
[2:39:12] <MarkUriah> That is his armor
[2:39:13] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's a plot element
[2:39:15] <ZeeJiggle> I mean those robes are fashionable man
[2:39:15] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HE LOVES THAT ARMOR
[2:39:15] <%VCRUZZO> HELL YEAH
[2:39:15] <Halospaz117> I mean it's a rad look
[2:39:15] <Doodle_Taco> *Sigh*
[2:39:17] <mattynezz> Revan likes them duds, they look fucking rad
[2:39:17] <Archmortal> It's a cool fucking costume, Woolie
[2:39:18] <montgomerynw> The mask restores Revans lost memories
[2:39:19] <%tuesti> it's the lewk
[2:39:21] <+cvp5127> he likes the look
[2:39:21] <usurper_sos> It is literal plot armor
[2:39:21] <%NopeBadguy> @memejima Every KH is FF and every FF is SW therefore every KH is SW
[2:39:21] <+Deano8817> fuck yeah
[2:39:22] <phatmac16> IT'S TO SELL MERCH
[2:39:22] <akman14> IT's a fashin choice
[2:39:23] <%wibbwobbler> the genders are flipped in my head
[2:39:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> HE KNOWS THAT THE ARMOR IS COOL
[2:39:25] <%CEGold> He likes the aesthetic Kappa
[2:39:25] <KnivesEve> star wars can never keep a character fine
[2:39:26] <%spiritofmojave> They should of kept their fucking mask on
[2:39:27] <+Nothing_Wild> He looks like Adam Jensen.
[2:39:29] <arkv01> hey man cool threads are threads
[2:39:29] <+oda_flobunaga> Luke wore black
[2:39:30] <%MrMoonGoose> He was like that before he fell
[2:39:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> @woolieversus you wanna know Exile's real name? also Keanu Revan
[2:39:31] <%krispen_wa> Mullet Man
[2:39:31] <+Deano8817> MULLET MAN BABY
[2:39:32] <%Gruhunchously> Mullet man
[2:39:32] <+Nothing_Wild> But with a mullet.
[2:39:34] <Joestar1890> Old canon Meetra design is WAY better than SWTOR Meetra Design
[2:39:34] <%kyh9> With the mask bolted on
[2:39:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> MULLET
[2:39:36] <%optimasmaximas> LUL lol
[2:39:38] <%VCRUZZO> mmhmm
[2:39:40] <KaiserMario> Show canon Exile
[2:39:41] <%spiritofmojave> MASK PLASTERED ON
[2:39:41] <JetpackMcQuack> It‚Äôs her brand
[2:39:41] <WanderingBard> Keanu Reaves
[2:39:43] <308caliber> light side Revan still has the mandalorian helmet?
[2:39:44] <Halospaz117> He's also voiced by Kyle Katarn
[2:39:44] <%MrMoonGoose> He literally had that same outfit before he fell
[2:39:45] <%Neoepochx> ...At least those KotOR comics were deece.
[2:39:48] <%Gruhunchously> Show us the canon Exile
[2:39:49] <time_axis> there's a lot of nuance missing from this explanation but its not worth going into
[2:39:51] <thealientrilogy> CANON EXILE IS SO MUCH WORSE
[2:39:51] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Revan is basically Keanu Reeves
[2:39:52] <+PlagueOfGripes> basically Revan's whole thing is he can't come to terms with his life as both a light side and dark side guy so he's mentally blocking his own powers for most of the stories
[2:39:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joestar1890 which are you referring to you
[2:39:54] <+Nothing_Wild> Either Mullet Man or the Soul Patch.
[2:39:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> the mask unlocks it, ina sense
[2:40:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Nobody cared who Revan was until he put on the Mask
[2:40:03] <%krispen_wa> isn't canon Meetra just the blonde face except a brunette
[2:40:06] <prime_name> Its just a white robe
[2:40:07] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus its jsut jedi robes
[2:40:11] <knotsundownsyndrome> white robes
[2:40:13] <+oda_flobunaga> SWTOR is to Reven what ME3 is to Tali
[2:40:15] <Halospaz117> @krispen_wa yeah, there's a mod for that
[2:40:16] <%Gruhunchously> ugh
[2:40:16] <tolloponik> just robes
[2:40:18] <Joestar1890> Old exile is just a short haired brunette
[2:40:19] <usurper_sos> LUL
[2:40:22] <%spiritofmojave> don't remind me
[2:40:23] <%sonofthedeepsouth> WOOLIE LOVES IT
[2:40:23] <%Irridium> oh god the exile design is so nothing
[2:40:25] <KaiserMario> LUL
[2:40:26] <%VCRUZZO> its a shame
[2:40:27] <%Gruhunchously> It's pretty bad
[2:40:28] <%sonofthedeepsouth> WOOLIE LOVES IT1
[2:40:28] <Doodle_Taco> G R E A T
[2:40:29] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:40:30] <%spiritofmojave> The designs are so lame
[2:40:31] <GilliamYaeger> That sigh of disgust.
[2:40:31] <%wibbwobbler> obi wan, like every other jedi
[2:40:36] <+aishman> This is what Pat meant by "It feels they were jealous of Kotor 2"
[2:40:38] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus donation goal to play through SWTOR?
[2:40:40] <%christopherwpoindexter> Exile is a nobody after KOTOR 2, she is Jesus incarnate in KOTOR 2
[2:40:41] <%CyanDeadEye> @BurdRightsActivist None of the choosable heads match up with the later versions
[2:40:42] <Monkeyweed21> Revan plans to use the Star Forge to mass produce HK-47s and use them to murder everyone in the Sith Empire, possibly including conquered innocents @WoolieVersus
[2:40:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @krispen_wa https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/118/596602-faces_of_the_exile.gif which one?
[2:40:48] <%Neoepochx> Bioware!
[2:40:50] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus This is what Pat meant by "It feels they were jealous of Kotor 2"
[2:40:50] <Halospaz117> "We didn't do KOTOR 2, so fuck it"
[2:40:54] <%kyh9> Bioware is salty over how good KOTOR2 was
[2:40:55] <prime_name> Kreia is not good in SWTOR
[2:40:56] <%wibbwobbler> yes lol
[2:40:57] <+RowenCleric> isnt exile and revan "in love" n swtor too?
[2:40:58] <Bruno_Tropical> The CURSE OF STAR WARS
[2:40:58] <%VCRUZZO> they shat on 2 so damn hard...
[2:40:59] <JackalKing> They pulled a Bethesda and completely ignored the better sequel made by Obsidian
[2:40:59] <%krispen_wa> @liquiddinosaur middle right
[2:41:01] <phatmac16> Bioware hates KOTOR 2
[2:41:03] <BurdRightsActivist> @CyanDeadEye I usually just headcanon Revan to look like Keanu Reeves
[2:41:03] <redamber1> i relate too hard to how bummed woolie looks right now
[2:41:06] <GilliamYaeger> Mm.
[2:41:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Jebaited
[2:41:07] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur 3rd on the right
[2:41:11] <%Neoepochx> Kinda like how Bethesda treats Fallout Stuff
[2:41:11] <+jjjkopf> @LiquidDinosaur center right
[2:41:14] <%Irridium> that's why I wasn't so bothered by the sequels because my favorite star wars thing was already butchered so fuck it
[2:41:18] <+oda_flobunaga> Palpatine was behind it all
[2:41:18] <%SouLucha> V I never played Swtor, so this is actively ruining Kotor in a way.
[2:41:18] <Airtighttrash> Bioware was jealous they were outdone, and they also never wrote anything good ever.
[2:41:19] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus As a little post mortem for KOTOR 2, I want to shout out the video essays "The Philosophy of Kreia", "The Failure of the Grey Jedi", and "The Foundations of Star Wars" as a critical analysis of SW, esp in regards to KOTOR 2.
[2:41:20] <%Gruhunchously> The amount of disrepect shown to KOTOR 2 is really sad.
[2:41:22] <Zouledge> at most you get tiny references here and there, which kotor 1 constantly is put on a pedestal
[2:41:23] <Halospaz117> HK is also there
[2:41:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> Exile is a Goddess in 2, and a chump afterwards
[2:41:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> Why would she have pigtails
[2:41:32] <Jmann9218> HK-47 Lives tho
[2:41:34] <prince_johnny_> Jesus Christ
[2:41:34] <TheAdMerlin> Dark side you go hunt down an escaped prisoner, and kill him
[2:41:35] <aiutare47> How can we make KOTOR when we killed KOTOR?
[2:41:38] <%krispen_wa> And then you kill him
[2:41:39] <%christopherwpoindexter> @liquiddinosaur why is the right question
[2:41:39] <%SouLucha> Glad I never payed into this.
[2:41:39] <%DatAsuna> ofc
[2:41:39] <Halospaz117> You kill him
[2:41:41] <%Irridium> ah yes the mid-boss
[2:41:42] <mikash91> think one of the dark side qusts is exterminating a cult of Racenites
[2:41:43] <knotsundownsyndrome> HK got fucked kind of too
[2:41:44] <JetpackMcQuack> Bless Obsidion
[2:41:44] <tolloponik> HK-551
[2:41:46] <thealientrilogy> YOU KILL HIM
[2:41:46] <+MidnightBurst12> Welcome to being a star wars fan in this decade
[2:41:47] <ZeeJiggle> He's playable at some point too, I think?
[2:41:47] <usurper_sos> He dies
[2:41:47] <%VCRUZZO> HK is Forever
[2:41:47] <knotsundownsyndrome> but HK is still good
[2:41:49] <%krispen_wa> And then you get shitty HK-60
[2:41:49] <mattynezz> A BUNCH of HK is in TOR
[2:41:49] <%Gruhunchously> HK was in Star War Galaxies
[2:41:50] <+gralho> hello, chat moon2SPY
[2:41:51] <Joestar1890> And you get TWO HK companions
[2:41:51] <$StaceMcGate> Revan programs HK to commit genocide
[2:41:52] <ht109> hk got lamer :\
[2:41:52] <prime_name> HK makes it all the way to Galaxies
[2:41:52] <prince_johnny_> Is it even possible to make a kotor 3?
[2:41:53] <%spiritofmojave> He got big merced
[2:41:53] <%lotharrio> HK is super yandere by that point, iirc.
[2:41:54] <$LightningLynx89> SWTOR is actually good tho
[2:41:57] <Doodle_Taco> @woolieversus Also Revan and Malak fell from talking to a Sith lord
[2:41:57] <ashenjuan25> Swtor Revan sucks
[2:41:59] <+oda_flobunaga> Hk's behavior core survives into the movie era
[2:42:00] <thealientrilogy> IT'S G A R B A G E
[2:42:02] <%jinking79> HK just a head
[2:42:04] <WanderingBard> Write your own KOTOR 3
[2:42:06] <phatmac16> YOU KILL HK S47
[2:42:06] <ashenjuan25> He‚Äôs a giant droid tho
[2:42:11] <Shade075> HK shows up in the first star wars MMOP too sw galaxies
[2:42:11] <knotsundownsyndrome> @oda_flobunaga wait what?
[2:42:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @phatmac16 KILL kill? Or just beat?
[2:42:20] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus wrong
[2:42:20] <%VCRUZZO> yeah
[2:42:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> the emperor has a mind control ability
[2:42:23] <%Neoepochx> BIOWARE EVERYONE
[2:42:23] <MarkUriah> EW
[2:42:25] <Halospaz117> IT"S SO BAD
[2:42:25] <time_axis> that's said in Kotor2 though
[2:42:26] <prince_johnny_> ???
[2:42:26] <%Gruhunchously> Again, anything in KOTOR 2 is just brushed aside in SWTOR
[2:42:28] <+PlagueOfGripes> he just makes them evil
[2:42:28] <+RedKnightVI> IT'S VERY BAD
[2:42:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> I HATE THIS
[2:42:29] <+Nothing_Wild> @jackalking Except, Bethesda didn‚Äôt... they‚Äôre still milking shit out of NV. BioWare went out of there way to ignore KOTOR2.
[2:42:29] <ht109> lmao
[2:42:29] <%krispen_wa> FUCKING DREW
[2:42:29] <montgomerynw> Yeah, that does suck
[2:42:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's terrible
[2:42:31] <+jjjkopf> they didn't fall just brainwash
[2:42:31] <Airtighttrash> Bioware sucks
[2:42:31] <+r_Foeburden87> that i didn't even know
[2:42:31] <tolloponik> FUCK THAT
[2:42:32] <e3a4> G A Y
[2:42:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> NUH UH
[2:42:33] <%Gruhunchously> It's really bad
[2:42:33] <Bruno_Tropical> The Emperor did it
[2:42:33] <308caliber> wait what
[2:42:34] <%lotharrio> Turns out Revan sucks?
[2:42:35] <Rixstarian> V: "Shut up Universe, SWTOR is fine cohhDerp "
[2:42:35] <%wibbwobbler> LEAVE REVAN ALONE. Can't wait for Disney to inevitably introduce revan
[2:42:35] <Joestar1890> IT'S BAAAAAAD
[2:42:36] <%krispen_wa> Fuck Drew
[2:42:36] <Doodle_Taco> YEAH FUCK THAT
[2:42:37] <phatmac16> NOPE
[2:42:37] <mattynezz> That's the worst thing right there
[2:42:38] <%Neoepochx> Yep. I remember that.
[2:42:40] <AllTheZibas> Thats a big dumb
[2:42:41] <olaksi> Bioware has never been able to write good villains, no
[2:42:41] <ashenjuan25> Yuck
[2:42:42] <Jmann9218> The Emperor beats Revan and Malak and turns them
[2:42:43] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:42:44] <%Gruhunchously> NAH NAH IT WAS THE SITH THOUGH
[2:42:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> fuck you Drew
[2:42:46] <%Jpshum> LUL
[2:42:49] <Halospaz117> IT'S DANGANRONPA 3
[2:42:50] <%MrMoonGoose> ...Oh, I forgot about that.
[2:42:53] <huskarl_zap> the emperor spreads his geneseed in Revan's bum
[2:42:54] <prime_name> I hate "true sith did it"
[2:42:54] <%Irridium> space Stalingrad
[2:42:54] <+jjjkopf> nope
[2:42:54] <%brachydios777> NotLikeThis
[2:42:55] <Doodle_Taco> FUCK SWTOR
[2:42:55] <PinkSocks> They should make a Kotor 3 that ignores SWTOR
[2:42:55] <Bruno_Tropical> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:42:56] <+oda_flobunaga> @knotsundownsyndrome there is a battle droid that got Hk's core implanted into it
[2:42:56] <jllovesnachos> You can get HK50 as a party member
[2:42:56] <+BioHunter> this is so bad
[2:42:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I wish I didn't know this.
[2:42:59] <Archmortal> I like this better because it's more consistent with Revan as a character. Same for Malak, a dumbshit that was too dumb to free himself from the influence
[2:43:00] <zeow31> And then V says SWTOR is fine lol
[2:43:02] <KnivesEve> man bioware sucked the whole time
[2:43:03] <%SouLucha> IT'S FINE, THE GAME IS FINE....
[2:43:04] <memejima> Where‚Äôs the restoration mod to REMOVE THAT KNOWLEDGE FROM MY BRAIN
[2:43:07] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @thealientrilogy
[2:43:10] <%MrMoonGoose> ITS FINE OTHERWISE
[2:43:13] <tolloponik> I was in, nowI'M OUT
[2:43:15] <ht109> show woolie dark side conclave to cleanse his pallet
[2:43:16] <SuperChumps> It is fine....
[2:43:16] <$StaceMcGate> yes
[2:43:18] <montgomerynw> SWTOR IS FINE just when you don't include KOTOR 2 or 1
[2:43:19] <%Irridium> oh yeah
[2:43:20] <$LightningLynx89> The game is fine, it's fun to play
[2:43:20] <time_axis> No, that was literally stated IN kotor2
[2:43:20] <%VCRUZZO> yup
[2:43:21] <%krispen_wa> THE REVAN NOVEL IS SHIIIIIT! SHIIIIIIIIT!
[2:43:22] <+deadeyemax> Lucas is the reason for a lot of these garbage retcons
[2:43:23] <BurdRightsActivist> COWARDS.
[2:43:24] <%Neoepochx> BIOWARE AND LUCASFILM
[2:43:24] <Halospaz117> @memejima The unrestoration mod
[2:43:24] <Doodle_Taco> YEP
[2:43:25] <$StaceMcGate> KOTOR 2 is butchered in SWTOR
[2:43:25] <Joestar1890> SWTOR is fine when it does it's own thing
[2:43:26] <prince_johnny_> Wow
[2:43:27] <+aishman> Kotor 2 means NOTHING in SWTOR
[2:43:31] <%MrMoonGoose> THE DOGFIGHTING IS REALLY GOOD
[2:43:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> good thing NONE of this is canon anymoreeeee
[2:43:32] <startstoprepeat> they give another character nihilus abilities and act like nihilus never existed
[2:43:35] <%Irridium> yeah KOTOR 2 was retconned even before the Disney shit
[2:43:37] <%wibbwobbler> retcon for the greater good
[2:43:38] <Airtighttrash> Swtor is the Disney sequels before Disney
[2:43:39] <%SouLucha> You can't tell me the fires around Swtor are fine enough.
[2:43:40] <GoldeNOVA> KOTOR: BACK OUT
[2:43:47] <%lotharrio> They show up for quests and cutscenes.
[2:43:49] <%kyh9> There are Revanites though, they're cool
[2:43:50] <ashenjuan25> Star Wars gotta parody itself
[2:43:55] <tolloponik> go kill this thing 10 times - Good job
[2:43:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> the anger this gives me can fuel us to do a non-canon Dark Side playthrough of 2
[2:43:55] <+cvp5127> swtor the backdown
[2:43:56] <%Gruhunchously> Bioware didn't know what to do with KOTOR 2
[2:43:57] <Reizie_Etherealm> KOTOR 3: The Bitch Lords
[2:43:59] <Monkeyweed21> Revan's big plan after freedom is using the Starforge to mass produce an army of HK-47s to plunge the Sith Empire into anarchy @WoolieVersus
[2:44:01] <%krispen_wa> FUCK SCOURGE
[2:44:03] <thealientrilogy> The Sith Emperor is just shit Nihilus BTW
[2:44:03] <Zouledge> lord scourge is a cool character imo
[2:44:07] <Halospaz117> DON'T BLAME YA
[2:44:07] <Ids560> Agent's pretty cool
[2:44:09] <%krispen_wa> AGENT IS GREAT THOUGH
[2:44:10] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> In KOTOR 1 it's explained that Revan and Malak went to the unknown regions and were turned bad.
[2:44:12] <%VCRUZZO> fuck Mr. Scourge
[2:44:12] <+Reaviar> this is why swtor is bad, the game is fine, but the story just makes you go what if
[2:44:13] <+kekkerscrew> Play Republic Trooper. It's BADASS
[2:44:15] <startstoprepeat> cipher nine, babyyyy
[2:44:17] <%VCRUZZO> get to it
[2:44:20] <Bruno_Tropical> Oooooooh PogChamp
[2:44:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Monkeyweed21 that is too stupid even for 2000s era Fanfiction
[2:44:22] <+cvp5127> vanitas
[2:44:23] <%Neoepochx> Kotor I and II are complete. Make your own headcannon for Kotor 3 :)
[2:44:25] <Doodle_Taco> Kreia was right, eveeything is echoes
[2:44:25] <ralphfromdk> Only good thing about SWtor is the Taris story line about the "promised land"
[2:44:26] <%VCRUZZO> get to the interesting bit
[2:44:27] <%krispen_wa> Cipher Nine is bae
[2:44:29] <huskarl_zap> Vitamins
[2:44:30] <+PlagueOfGripes> the force
[2:44:32] <Nekros4442> Kingdom Hearts BS
[2:44:32] <+aishman> THE FORCE
[2:44:33] <mattynezz> Magic
[2:44:33] <Archmortal> It's bad and not worth contextualizing
[2:44:34] <%lotharrio> Force ghosts
[2:44:35] <Camail> the force is fucking MAGIC
[2:44:36] <%CyanDeadEye> Revan was too angry to die
[2:44:36] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus force magic
[2:44:37] <Joestar1890> BECAUSE FOOOOORCE
[2:44:38] <+Deano8817> @WoolieVersus empire side kills him, and then he splits, it's bad
[2:44:38] <usurper_sos> Da force
[2:44:38] <%spiritofmojave> Because FORCE MECHANICS
[2:44:38] <montgomerynw> He dies but the Dark Side one refused to die and held on to his body
[2:44:38] <phatmac16> THE FORCE
[2:44:39] <e3a4> Kreia was right, they should have destroyed the Force
[2:44:40] <%wibbwobbler> i hate it so fucking much
[2:44:41] <+oda_flobunaga> like how Kurama got split
[2:44:42] <%kyh9> His Trauma in the Dark Side, his good stuff in his light-side
[2:44:42] <+balouie> this is why kreia was right
[2:44:43] <+MagicBeanBurrito> the torture
[2:44:43] <$LightningLynx89> THE FORCE IS MAGIC
[2:44:44] <%spiritofmojave> THE FORCE CAN DO ALL
[2:44:45] <+thatotherblackkid> One is a force ghost and the other is the body?
[2:44:47] <%DSD24> This is some Fate Extella shit
[2:44:47] <+cvp5127> like xehanort
[2:44:48] <%brachydios777> Light side is like a force ghost
[2:44:48] <huskarl_zap> PRATT Kreygasm psaWhat_SG PogChamp
[2:44:49] <ShyDispatch> It's basically "Lightside: Guess I'm dying." "Darkside: What no I'm not"
[2:44:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ralphfromdk was the promised land real?
[2:44:56] <ShyDispatch> That's it, that's how the split happens.
[2:44:57] <tolloponik> as a man name Palpitene
[2:44:58] <JetpackMcQuack> The force CoolStoryBob
[2:45:00] <+Nothing_Wild> It‚Äôs frustrating that KOTOR2 got shafted, but TLJ got to do a bad version of it all, while retroactively making the original films worse.
[2:45:01] <NaturalGear> no one's ever really gone :)
[2:45:01] <SomersaultJustice> scourge the hedgehog?
[2:45:02] <%Irridium> you know if Kreia had killed the force all this stupid shit wouldn't have happened makesyouthink
[2:45:02] <+PlagueOfGripes> Vitiate is an okay concept
[2:45:04] <%DSD24> Splitting someone into different versions of themselves
[2:45:05] <%Gruhunchously> Scourge is the Villain Sue
[2:45:06] <%krispen_wa> SCOURGE YOU DUMB IDIOT
[2:45:08] <mattynezz> Darkside Revan actually revives the Emperor
[2:45:09] <Archmortal> OH A FORCE VISION WAS FALSE?
[2:45:10] <$Invlux> Scourge the Hedgehog? Kappa
[2:45:11] <%kyh9> He's good as the Knight
[2:45:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @aiutare47
[2:45:17] <%brachydios777> The dark version is his physical body
[2:45:17] <%krispen_wa> YOU KILLED THE EXILE FOR THIS?
[2:45:17] <+MagicBeanBurrito> His spirit let go of his body during the torture so his body turns darkside
[2:45:18] <phatmac16> KREIA SHOULD'VE KILLED THE FORCE
[2:45:18] <+oda_flobunaga> should have let Kreia win
[2:45:21] <%Neoepochx> Scourge literally fucked everything up. Force Visions are always GARBAGE
[2:45:22] <phatmac16> KREIA WAS RIGHT
[2:45:23] <%krispen_wa> SPLIT MYSELF IN TWOOOO
[2:45:25] <TDAWS_MP132> EXILE DIED FOR NOTHING?

[2:45:27] <Bruno_Tropical> LUL LUL LUL
[2:45:27] <ht109> kreia should have won
[2:45:29] <CandideCamera> Revan gets beat by the player characters in a boss fight, then he dies/becomes a force ghost, but only the good part went to heaven and the bad part decided to hang around and be another boss fight
[2:45:29] <$LightningLynx89> Kreia is so up her own ass
[2:45:30] <Airtighttrash> he like dies and turns into two force ghosts or shoe shit
[2:45:30] <%krispen_wa> BLOODSTAINED
[2:45:30] <+sphiraki> 7 Revans of Light versus 13 Pockets
[2:45:31] <phatmac16> KREIA WANTED TO STOP SWOTOR
[2:45:31] <%MrMoonGoose> TBF Metal Gear also did it
[2:45:31] <+PlagueOfGripes> light side is a ghost
[2:45:31] <Doodle_Taco> KREIA WAS RIGHT
[2:45:31] <Zouledge> someone stop woolie please
[2:45:33] <%SouLucha> Scourge is too edgy of a name.. Just reminds me of a certain edgehog.
[2:45:35] <%krispen_wa> HELLFIRE
[2:45:35] <huskarl_zap> SCOURGE THE COMMANDO PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:45:35] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Revan was so powerful that his body just refused to die and became pure dark side Revan while his ghost was light side

[2:45:38] <%krispen_wa> SHADOW

[2:45:50] <%MrMoonGoose> *desperately making excuses for SWTOR*
[2:45:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Kreia was right
[2:45:50] <+oda_flobunaga> Writing Fallout NV

[2:45:51] <time_axis> this is what happens when you read the most abridged version of a story possible
[2:45:53] <KaiserMario> It's kinda like the Lords of Shadow from Castlevania Lords of Shadow, their ggod sides ascend into heaven and they leave their evil sides on earth and become the LoS
[2:45:55] <NekoZen> Dying Light 2
[2:45:56] <Airtighttrash> KREIA RELEASE US FROM THIS HELL

[2:48:58] <+ntfth> It was before REvan left. Her looking after her kid is the explanation for why she didn't help with Nihilus and Sion.

[2:49:07] <+Deano8817> I mean, it's related
[2:49:07] <%razielhex> Arcann and Thexan
[2:49:08] <+sphiraki> the dark side of revan inserted her semen into the light side timeline of revan using xehanort powers

[2:49:46] <+kapcommunist> Alex Caruso?
[2:49:46] <%razielhex> @ShiningAxis It's a subversion. Thexan is in black; Arcann in is White. They're meant to be opposing. Vitiate wanted them to compete with each other and hate each other.
[2:49:50] <%lotharrio> Yo, would Star Wars be way better, if it weren't for the setting?
[2:49:52] <OmniSTylez> malak and reven!

[2:50:40] <%optimasmaximas> why do people say maul and talon are friends?
[2:50:43] <%lotharrio> Or Sith
[2:50:44] <%Gruhunchously> One of the player characters
[2:50:49] <%krispen_wa> @icytvtuber I'm butthurt people are making fun of my shitty MMO
[2:50:51] <%DSD24> I want his face off
[2:50:52] <huskarl_zap> darth sex
[2:50:56] <BurdRightsActivist> Nobody cared who I was until I PUT ON THE MASK
[2:50:57] <OmniSTylez> damn
[2:50:59] <%lotharrio> @optimasmaximas It's a Lucas quote.
[2:51:01] <Dangerzone979> Man I love these guys
[2:51:02] <mattynezz> @optimasmaximas Lucas said it, when he found their toys and ruined the Maul game
[2:51:05] <+MagicBeanBurrito> YEYEYE STATUES
[2:51:12] <%spiritofmojave> George Lucas played with two figures of Maul and Darth Talon LUL
[2:51:13] <%MrMoonGoose> get off our planet, wannabes
[2:51:14] <Bruno_Tropical> @optimasmaximas a reference to an never made Maul game
[2:51:18] <%razielhex> that's supposed to be the Lightsabers of Saele Shan and Darth Malgus
[2:51:19] <IcyTvTuber> yeah its not great but to just "NONONONO" is just childish seeming
[2:51:21] <%spiritofmojave> hence the dumb quote
[2:51:23] <%DatAsuna> Also tros ripped it off
[2:51:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> @icytvtuber I'm sure other stuff in the game is good, it's just the part about the Exile/Revan is...oh.m
[2:51:30] <+tearfuldevil> @optimasmaximas supposedly Lucas took a figurine of eahc, held them together, and said "they're friends"
[2:51:30] <IcyTvTuber> i agree
[2:51:31] <%lotharrio> He was the weaker brother.
[2:51:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas Long story but tldr is George Lucas saw a picture of Darth Talon and basically cancelled a planned Darth Maul game because he wanted thm to make it co-op where you play as Maul and Talon. The game designers tried to explain Darth Talon and Maul live like 100 years apart but it didnt work
[2:51:37] <OmniSTylez> o
[2:51:41] <%Gruhunchously> It must have been all the head trauma
[2:51:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @optimasmaximas the game died in dev hell

[2:52:47] <mak0t0yukii> 3630 BABIES
[2:52:47] <%VCRUZZO> @LiquidDinosaur Once
[2:52:51] <%razielhex> @GrassCannon Well, they're children of the Sith Emperor. They have his genetics. The entire point of grooming them was that Vitiate literally wanted them to fight and kill each other; and only the winner would prove the best so he could just take over their body and continue living
[2:52:51] <Joestar1890> Your brother was a BITCH, you're MUCH better
[2:52:54] <%optimasmaximas> @LiquidDinosaur oh i know about that game, heard the development hell unfold as a child, and it sucked when i heard it got cancelled cause i saw that snippet of gameplay they put out of it
[2:52:54] <+Reaviar> basically the dad was waiting for one of the sons to kill the other to assume his role as the true son
[2:52:55] <+PlagueOfGripes> well. one of his bodies anyway
[2:52:56] <Goraka91> Yeah I can't really see Vitate and Valky being the same guy
[2:52:57] <%wibbwobbler> love it

[2:53:08] <phatmac16> XENAHORT
[2:53:09] <Bruno_Tropical> @optimasmaximas no, it was going to be a Maul game, but then Lucas saw Talon and told them to make a diferent game where two of the same species are friends
[2:53:09] <tolloponik> Kingdom hearts

[2:53:15] <phatmac16> XENOHORT
[2:53:16] <%kyh9> @PlagueOfGripes The best part of it is that he basically leaves the Sith Empire for his 'other' family

[2:53:24] <%razielhex> @Goraka91 The Sith Emperor basically transcended life, so he existed as an Intelligence, rather than a body.

[2:54:17] <%Irridium> "Aight, I'mma head out" *starts new empire*
[2:54:21] <+koldfusion87> ancestor of Palpatine
[2:54:22] <zeow31> The guy so bored he rules 2 empires at once
[2:54:23] <%DatAsuna> He's not
[2:54:24] <%GrassCannon> his number is *that* big
[2:54:30] <time_axis> most of them dont even talk to him, there's a whole hierarchy
[2:54:31] <%razielhex> @Goraka91 That's a part of the Revan Mindmeld. If you track when Valkorion was birthing the twins and his daughter, it was at the end of the war.
[2:54:34] <WanderingBard> He's hungry boi with no drawbacks
[2:54:35] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Valkquirkian
[2:54:35] <aiutare47> You ain‚Äôt even finished your empire and you want dessert?
[2:54:37] <Joestar1890> You need some kind of Ritual to kill or trap him
[2:54:37] <R3c0n31> He gained the one thing that no other sith will ever obtain
[2:54:38] <%Gruhunchously> He has a big number
[2:54:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> What are the diplomatic relations like between the two empires
[2:54:39] <+Deano8817> he was birthed as a true sith
[2:54:39] <Zouledge> by that point the sith are not with him and are actively hunting him
[2:54:39] <+Reaviar> hes like a space cloud
[2:54:40] <huskarl_zap> this came.out before the disney star wars yet they knew?
[2:54:41] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus THe empire has been ruled by the dark council and not the emperor for centuries
[2:54:44] <phatmac16> He's Roa from Tsukihime?
[2:54:45] <Jmann9218> He literally ate a 2 planets of Sith to become that powerful
[2:54:47] <Dangerzone979> He has a council run the Sith Empire
[2:54:48] <tolloponik> OK, Sith Legion is pretty busted
[2:54:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Kappa
[2:54:51] <zocano> the big dumb
[2:54:51] <DeathByPoke7> so that is what happened in the cutscene
[2:54:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> he also Nihiluses his homeworld to gain that power. he's basically Darth Nihilus 2 in a lot of ways. Which is why Malgus wants him dead at all costs
[2:54:57] <%kyh9> One of the Knight party members is meant to be one of his vessel bodies
[2:54:59] <neilgilbertg97> Kinda like a desiese?
[2:55:01] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> Tenebrae- AKA - Vitiate - AKA Valkorion
[2:55:03] <$LightningLynx89> @WoolieVersus Too bad Chris Avalon is so far up his own ass to take criticism for his "critiques" and "deconstruction" of certain elements to be called shallow. Kreia is just an insert of Avalon going "I don't like the force." Just like how the Legion is his own thought experiment on how "society should be ran in the post-apocalypse" in Fallout New Vegas.
[2:55:04] <Bruno_Tropical> @optimasmaximas no, he wanted Maul Talon to be friends , but didnt know they were millenia apart, so the dev team had to create similar characters like descendents or something
[2:55:07] <+SaltyGhostRock> Drake monkaS
[2:55:12] <%kyh9> I wish we could let him
[2:55:14] <Joestar1890> He becomes your shoulder devil for throughout the expansion
[2:55:16] <%optimasmaximas> @Bruno_Tropical oh ok
[2:55:17] <%wibbwobbler> and then the game starts
[2:55:17] <Goraka91> Hold up did Rise of Skywalker just steal that
[2:55:18] <CodeSodaboi> Vitiate is the antithesis to all life. He creates Malachors. His will to live outclasses everything until you show up. Eternal Throne ends with him being defeated and told he must "let go". SWTOR isnt perfect but it follows the themes of Star Wars and KOTOR II.

[2:56:17] <time_axis> space is big
[2:56:18] <ashenjuan25> BioWare likes that trope
[2:56:18] <%suitangi021> !uptime
[2:56:18] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 56 minutes
[2:56:20] <countgaculatv> I mean you technically kill him twice.
[2:56:21] <Joestar1890> It would be much better if it was one empire
[2:56:21] <%SouLucha> It's Sith all the way down.
[2:56:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @silverira
[2:56:24] <+Reaviar> granted the sith and republic were fighting for a while weakening each other
[2:56:29] <%Ashenik1> @LightningLynx89 i dont wanna be this guy but..... source??
[2:56:29] <Jmann9218> But you get to rule that other empire in SWTOR
[2:56:29] <Doodle_Taco> Not fine tho
[2:56:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> Sylvanus cracks Nihilus' mask in half
[2:56:33] <Yaddabluh> sounds a lot like the plot of one piece
[2:56:34] <huskarl_zap> what about Exksaghol tho?
[2:56:40] <+oda_flobunaga> Except, Exogol was the Exogol that killed all Exogols
[2:56:44] <Joestar1890> Still plays like an MMO though
[2:56:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:56:52] <%kyh9> Valkorion was cool tho
[2:56:53] <ashenjuan25> Swtor was a mistake
[2:56:54] <%wibbwobbler> when do the whills come into play?
[2:56:56] <Yaddabluh> amd then there was another strong guy, and then thete was an even stronger guy, and then-
[2:56:59] <Zouledge> i disagree greatly with you, fallen empire is so much worse than vanilla story imo
[2:57:00] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Exagol was the emperors we made along the way
[2:57:05] <startstoprepeat> it sucks because this is where they dropped the class-specific stories and meant we'd never get payoff to that stuff
[2:57:10] <+oda_flobunaga> There will never be another Exogol because of Exogol
[2:57:11] <%shoutofthehobo> asuna is on point!
[2:57:13] <+Freeborg23> @Moobot Kreia: within the Exile, I see the possibility to see Moobot die...
[2:57:14] <%VCRUZZO> it is actually interesting, but it seems like they really just wanted to make a RPG game instead of an MMO
[2:57:15] <Goraka91> All I know is I adore the light side Sith concept
[2:57:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> is SWToR dead? like are they done making content?
[2:57:25] <ashenjuan25> Palpatine‚Äôs behind it all
[2:57:29] <%Neoepochx> @startstoprepeat They dropped a lot of shit and really dropped the ball with this game.
[2:57:33] <%SouLucha> Guys, I stop caring.. I'm dead.
[2:57:33] <BurdRightsActivist> ACKTUALLY
[2:57:40] <startstoprepeat> ayup
[2:57:44] <+oda_flobunaga> APATHY IS DEATH
[2:57:44] <+Deano8817> @LiquidDinosaur still going, republic and empire are still fighting each other
[2:57:47] <phatmac16> ACTUALLY
[2:57:49] <Doodle_Taco> Yep
[2:57:52] <%SouLucha> Swtor killed me.
[2:57:53] <R3c0n31> ACTUALLY
[2:57:58] <aiutare47> @liquiddinosaur Content wise I don‚Äôt know but I thought it was DoA server wise for some reason.
[2:58:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> the true sith were the people who kidnapped us along the way
[2:58:04] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> they dont get kidnapped they actually go to dromund kaas and get brainwashed
[2:58:06] <%krispen_wa> I feel like Onslaught really just invalidates the entire KOTET and KOTFE parts
[2:58:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ok so if I wanted to start playing SWTOR right NOW how likely/good would it be?
[2:58:11] <%optimasmaximas> yea
[2:58:13] <%kyh9> He basically is
[2:58:16] <phatmac16> FANFIC TRASH
[2:58:16] <countgaculatv> Remember the Dread Lords chat?
[2:58:17] <usurper_sos> Well yeah!
[2:58:19] <%kyh9> You have to kill him while he's in your own body
[2:58:19] <%Gruhunchously> Well yeah
[2:58:20] <nexusj13> The motherfucker eats a planet
[2:58:21] <+oda_flobunaga> sooo Kaguya?
[2:58:21] <mattynezz> You fight him in a magic mind realm
[2:58:23] <%spiritofmojave> it sure is
[2:58:23] <Goraka91> Star Wars has had a few of those, but yeah dumb escalation
[2:58:24] <+jjjkopf> he's my OC and he's SO STRONG
[2:58:24] <%VCRUZZO> He is a fanfic problem
[2:58:25] <%CyanDeadEye> lol
[2:58:26] <+ondri21> yea ihes OD
[2:58:27] <R3c0n31> He discovered a GOD power and made him godlike
[2:58:27] <%brachydios777> Yep
[2:58:27] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Fanfic writer
[2:58:28] <%krispen_wa> Valkorion FUCKS
[2:58:29] <usurper_sos> Thats it

[2:58:33] <+oda_flobunaga> Emps fucks
[2:58:33] <Joestar1890> Valkorian gets around
[2:58:34] <+cvp5127> mindjack
[2:58:34] <FoolproofDread> He's a colossal Gary Stu of a character.
[2:58:36] <%Neoepochx> SOUL TRANSFER
[2:58:37] <Doodle_Taco> Kaguya was great right guys???
[2:58:39] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Valkorion Cooms
[2:58:42] <%Gruhunchously> WHY DOES AN IMMORTAL GUY NEED HEIRS?
[2:58:44] <%Order_of_Mystery> Order_of_Mystery subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 6 months of quality Woolie content! And thank you to LittleV for making an already hype LP even better. Keep being awesome, fellas! woolieLORE
[2:58:45] <CandideCamera> Luckily you are an MMO character which makes you super special with the biggest dick to kill the Force god
[2:58:45] <%Irridium> Kreia was right
[2:58:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> SW'S KAGUYA LUL

[2:58:49] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:58:49] <countgaculatv> This dude had two families btw
[2:58:50] <%spiritofmojave> imagine Q levels of a deity being but someone's horrible fanfic
[2:58:52] <ashenjuan25> Valkorian sounds op to the point of being lame
[2:58:52] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Because he likes to fuck
[2:58:52] <$LightningLynx89> @Ashenik1 Multiple interviews where he basically jerks off his own philosophical creations.
[2:58:52] <%SouLucha> Omg, I'm glad Disney killed this... NotLikeThis
[2:58:54] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Revan then comes back from Dromund Kaas and starts a fight with trying to convert jedi, etc, etc, etc

[2:59:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SITH EMPEROR LOVES TO FUCK
[2:59:03] <Dangerzone979> @Gruhunchously Because his soul is immortal not his body
[2:59:04] <+tearfuldevil> @Gruhunchously his bodies get old, so he wants cool new bodies? i dunno?
[2:59:04] <mattynezz> Yes
[2:59:06] <+oda_flobunaga> Who cares?
[2:59:06] <%DSD24> Man this is just like Flemeth in DAO
[2:59:07] <%Irridium> @CandideCamera but what about all the other big-dick MMO players

[3:02:14] <huskarl_zap> Oh god it's the mass effect punk ass women
[3:02:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> it's hard to imagine Vitiate having a kid since he has basically no emotions beyond a lust for power and domination

[3:02:46] <akman14> Don't think of it
[3:02:47] <%optimasmaximas> lol, tell that to the weird alien race that invades post-empire LUL
[3:02:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> wasn't Vitiate originally a sith, not a human, before his first transfer?
[3:02:48] <countgaculatv> @PlagueOfGripes I imagine he doesn't do it outta lust, but just for more bodies to take
[3:02:49] <Jmann9218> Because of how Hyperspace travel works its easy to miss things
[3:02:50] <jorniev> IS IT?
[3:02:53] <%Neoepochx> Unknown regions has Force bullshit that causes people to be not able to travel it properly
[3:02:53] <+SicilianFiraga> SicilianFiraga subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[3:03:11] <jorniev> outside of the known space?
[3:03:14] <+Reaviar> the pike is the best thing this game made
[3:03:19] <%lotharrio> You can't send droids out without someone watching. They might think they are free.
[3:03:19] <huskarl_zap> others just waiting
[3:03:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah you can't just go to lightspeed 5 times in a row with no calculations Kappa

[3:03:46] <%lotharrio> He's also a Sith so... you know, he has access to their tech.
[3:03:47] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NAH MOM I LIKE DAD
[3:03:49] <BlueMoonBlues> Half those dudes were just standing around waiting to get stabbed
[3:03:49] <CodeSodaboi> @PlagueOfGripes Vitiate was originally a sith peasant
[3:03:53] <Jmann9218> No the Emperor brought them Lightsabers
[3:03:56] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I LIKE DAD MORE MOM
[3:03:59] <high_wizard_of_chaos> What the hell is this whack-ass crazy nerd shit?
[3:04:00] <%spiritofmojave> I like my garbage dad now :)
[3:04:01] <%VCRUZZO> crazy how well this fight is done compared to Sequel fights
[3:04:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Republic never invented a Hubble Space Telescope to look at distant planets
[3:04:05] <%DSD24> Jack is super lame
[3:04:05] <%razielhex> This is Vitiate's homeworld or some shit
[3:04:06] <$LightningLynx89> Lightsabers have existed for 25,000 years
[3:04:09] <%Gruhunchously> It's not Star Wars without lightsabers
[3:04:15] <%wibbwobbler> yes, lightsabers show up super early in lore
[3:04:15] <%krispen_wa> then Marka Ragnos looked at Vitiate and he was like "yo, you're cool"
[3:04:17] <tolloponik> those hood guys are cool
[3:04:19] <+therabbles> shouldn't have waited so long for the rescue attempt
[3:04:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> i want OG Lightsabers with a backpack battery
[3:04:24] <Goraka91> Infiniter Fleet
[3:04:24] <+MagicBeanBurrito> the troopers of Zakuul are called skytroopers
[3:04:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> and a power cable
[3:04:29] <%SouLucha> Are there Lightsabers bread cutters?
[3:04:30] <Pistachius> there is lore about the creation of lightsabers somewhere
[3:04:31] <jorniev> we're is the dark saber?
[3:04:32] <%CyanDeadEye> Yes
[3:04:35] <%kyh9> ye
[3:04:36] <Retinolgaming> Yes you can
[3:04:38] <Zouledge> you can with real money
[3:04:39] <%optimasmaximas> lightsaber pikes are cool
[3:04:39] <tolloponik> Lightsaber lance
[3:04:41] <Joestar1890> Rey should've had a light pike
[3:04:43] <%razielhex> Pike is totally a weapon, with single/double versions of it
[3:04:45] <haitakaa> vitiate nuked his home World
[3:04:49] <%WutangchickeN> Can they fly with their lightsabers like those jackasses in Clone Wars? XD
[3:04:50] <%kyh9> @Joestar1890 agreed
[3:04:51] <TheLemuroid> What are the advantages of a light saber pole arm
[3:04:51] <%Gruhunchously> Using a lightsaber as a flashlight is pretty cool. Pretty practical.
[3:04:51] <%SicilianFiraga> The emperor used his planet to power a ritual, Zakuul was a civilization he found and ruled over through proxy bodies
[3:05:02] <T_Sasquatch> Edgeeeeee
[3:05:03] <tidalwafer> this all sounds pretty dumb
[3:05:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pistachius in the KOTOR comics that predate the game the original ligthsabers needed a big battery pack and a physical power cable
[3:05:08] <%lotharrio> Goth waifu? 0w0
[3:05:08] <arran_throttle> monkaS
[3:05:12] <jorniev> it's the jackasses from rebels
[3:05:15] <haitakaa> SWTOR is free to play
[3:05:16] <Goraka91> Oops spawn of satan
[3:05:22] <%DSD24> Edge Girl
[3:05:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pistachius in the game they opted to just make it identical to the movies for marketability
[3:05:24] <mattynezz> She's a super whiny and annoying character, put your dicks away
[3:05:25] <Bruno_Tropical> breaking the frame rate
[3:05:27] <%kyh9> She gets locked on Force Chernobyl basically
[3:05:27] <huskarl_zap> Woolie and his devils games
[3:05:27] <%razielhex> Those people dead on the ground are Senya's personal regiment that her daughter murdered to get to her.
[3:05:31] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SHE LOVES EVIL
[3:05:32] <%Neoepochx> Dark Side corruption to make people evil is nuts.
[3:05:32] <+kapcommunist> more powerfuller
[3:05:32] <+cvp5127> and then there was ANOTHER child
[3:05:34] <automata93> That seemed neat
[3:05:34] <haitakaa> and if you subscribe once you keep all the stuff once it runs out
[3:05:34] <+MagicBeanBurrito> She was born evil
[3:05:36] <prince_johnny_> LUL

[3:06:02] <jaygee303> Was that the last expansion
[3:06:08] <+UberWolfman> Shitty Azula
[3:06:11] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @WutangchickeN (warning)
[3:06:11] <Goraka91> Really though down to the mental illness
[3:06:13] <mattynezz> Azula if Azula sucked, don't just call her Azula
[3:06:13] <jorniev> NOT REVAN
[3:06:14] <%Neoepochx> WOULD YOU KINDLY

[3:06:28] <%Gruhunchously> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[3:06:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> this sounds AWFUL
[3:06:34] <%Gruhunchously> I AM SUBHUMAN
[3:06:35] <%CyanDeadEye> Yes

[3:06:50] <%krispen_wa> Literally just shitty Azula
[3:06:54] <R3c0n31> You cant just jump into an insane body lol
[3:06:55] <Pistachius> @liquiddinosaur yes! aaah, yes! thanks.
[3:06:57] <jorniev> BREAKING THE LIMITS
[3:06:58] <countgaculatv> This is literally Avatar
[3:07:00] <haitakaa> the emporer wants the mc
[3:07:01] <%DatAsuna> Even I disagree with that lol
[3:07:01] <Zouledge> kneel before the dragon of zakuul is a cool phrase so there is that
[3:07:03] <+Deano8817> sith warrior has the best eternal empire story tbh
[3:07:05] <Goraka91> PogChamp
[3:07:08] <%optimasmaximas> oof
[3:07:11] <automata93> LUL
[3:07:13] <+aishman> It sucks
[3:07:14] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> !uptime
[3:07:14] <%DatAsuna> Vaylin was better before that
[3:07:14] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 7 minutes
[3:07:15] <%Gruhunchously> Screw Bioware
[3:07:15] <TheLemuroid> So do all the emperor bodies get along? How does he avoid the Duplicity scenario?
[3:07:16] <$Invlux> UNLIMITED KOTOR WORKS
[3:07:17] <%krispen_wa> Agent has beth Eternal Empire story
[3:07:17] <%Jpshum> it sucks
[3:07:18] <time_axis> some of the class stories are very good. That's all I'll say.
[3:07:18] <Archmortal> And I would still prefer a real KOTOR 3 following Revan and the Exile
[3:07:21] <Zouledge> they added pvp to starfighters
[3:07:21] <usurper_sos> And it isn't good
[3:07:21] <%MrMoonGoose> It isn't on rails
[3:07:22] <%Irridium> it's just another MMO
[3:07:23] <tolloponik> mmo pay to get to the cool stuff
[3:07:24] <sircool099> 8 class lines that could've been side stories and main story for one game
[3:07:27] <+JustToWatch> Wait how do they beat her then
[3:07:31] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Woolie looks done
[3:07:32] <Jmann9218> Light Side Sith is a giant troll
[3:07:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pistachius https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Protosaber
[3:07:35] <+deadeyemax> they literally copy entire specs from wow
[3:07:36] <+oda_flobunaga> UUUUUUUUUUugh
[3:07:38] <%MrMoonGoose> The dogfighting isn't on rails.
[3:07:38] <%DatAsuna> The agent stuff super varies.
[3:07:40] <+BioHunter> i'll stick to ff14 for good story mmo
[3:07:40] <%Neoepochx> @WoolieVersus Ask Little V if he misses the Larry Holland X-Wing games. LUL BibleThump
[3:07:43] <%kyh9> A bit
[3:07:45] <jorniev> BOOOOO
[3:07:46] <haitakaa> the sith warrior story is so good
[3:07:48] <%DatAsuna> You know all that before he's in your head
[3:07:48] <%kyh9> His father
[3:07:50] <Pistachius> @liquiddinosaur wasn't there something else as well before this. like they used to use swords that were like coated in the force or something
[3:07:51] <+Reaviar> it was his father
[3:07:52] <%spiritofmojave> @biohunter right on
[3:07:53] <jorniev> no
[3:07:55] <%Gruhunchously> Well, obviously
[3:07:56] <%kyh9> He found his father and put him in a box
[3:07:57] <mattynezz> Not really. He's just like HURR I'M EVIL
[3:07:58] <%CyanDeadEye> Lana Beniko is probably the best thing the added later on.
[3:07:59] <%Ashenik1> @LightningLynx89 man you have to give me a specific source where Avellons simps for the Legion becasue I cannot find it
[3:08:02] <tolloponik> it also has the Fallout 4 dialogue so no choosing how you want to answer
[3:08:03] <%MrMoonGoose> The dogfighting is 100% not on rails
[3:08:03] <JetpackMcQuack> Cool though
[3:08:04] <jorniev> why would it
[3:08:05] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus can we post links to sick kotor 2 fanart??????
[3:08:08] <%krispen_wa> Lana Beniko is waifu
[3:08:15] <%kyh9> Valkorion was THIS close to being interesting if he was chill and actually wanted to ally with you
[3:08:24] <Pistachius> @liquiddinosaur i may be remembering something else entirely lol
[3:08:24] <%SouLucha> ANOTHER ONE
[3:08:26] <startstoprepeat> star cabal was neat, basically non-force sensitives doing the "yo, fuck this force shit" as an illuminati
[3:08:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Pistachius i mean lots of those mummies on Korriban have swords. like AJunta Pall etc
[3:08:33] <zeow31> He tries poorly to manipulate your character
[3:08:33] <%lotharrio> Try for grey
[3:08:34] <+tearfuldevil> @Ashenik1 i do know he said that FNV wasn't supposed to be political, which is super easy to find
[3:08:36] <%optimasmaximas> BALANCE THO!!!!
[3:08:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:08:38] <%kyh9> They're a cult around Valkorion
[3:08:39] <%Irridium> @MrMoonGoose before the starfighter update they were. I mean sure you could move across the screen but you had no real 3D control
[3:08:39] <R3c0n31> A gray empire ran by a SITH
[3:08:41] <%kyh9> No
[3:08:43] <WanderingBard> Knights draw their power from *justice*
[3:08:44] <Doodle_Taco> This sounds like really bad fanfiction
[3:08:45] <Archmortal> It's not purple, and that's an important distinction
[3:08:45] <%krispen_wa> Star Cabal was basically "KREIA WAS RIGHT"
[3:08:46] <%kyh9> They're JUSTICE
[3:08:47] <JetpackMcQuack> What an idea
[3:08:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Do they EVER mention Kreia?
[3:08:59] <montgomerynw> They are powered by devotion to the Emperor
[3:09:00] <+pizzadeliveryman> Eternal throne was pretty good but not as great
[3:09:02] <%kyh9> They're basically the Catholic Church
[3:09:03] <Pistachius> yellow are called Sentinel i thought?
[3:09:05] <Goraka91> Yeah i'd agree with that
[3:09:05] <$LightningLynx89> @LiquidDinosaur No cause she sucks
[3:09:06] <%krispen_wa> No they don't mention Kreia
[3:09:07] <%Neoepochx> @LiquidDinosaur Of course not.
[3:09:13] <%Neoepochx> @LightningLynx89 Good fucking meme.
[3:09:14] <%MrMoonGoose> @irridium oh, ew. Must have been before I played
[3:09:14] <zeow31> They pretend to be grey but their leaders are chaotic evil dark side
[3:09:16] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Red blue yellow, primary colors
[3:09:17] <%spiritofmojave> @tearfuldevil that speaks quite differently from the product they put out lol
[3:09:17] <countgaculatv> @LiquidDinosaur Not really. It's 300 years past her
[3:09:18] <Goraka91> REAL dirty
[3:09:19] <jorniev> DAMMIT
[3:09:21] <Zouledge> fun fact valkorian's VA also does Reinhardt in overwatch but the character isnt as interesting as kreia
[3:09:22] <%DatAsuna> I think when it's good it's better than kotor 1, and when it's not, it's not.
[3:09:22] <tolloponik> emperor Myazaki: I made a good empire I'm done later: one more Empire!!!
[3:09:23] <%lotharrio> Oh shit, people saying Justice Side actually reminds me. I've heard of this before.
[3:09:24] <%krispen_wa> @lightninglynx89 imagine beinf this butthurt over granny
[3:09:26] <prime_name> Kreia also gets done dirty
[3:09:29] <%lotharrio> Duty to the state and whatever.
[3:09:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Neoepochx @LightningLynx89 TO BE FAIR I dont think anyone still living knows that Kreia existed except Revan
[3:09:36] <mattynezz> I wouldn't say that. It's like half a tier below KoTOR1, if KoTOR1 didn't have Revan
[3:09:36] <%SouLucha> Into the TRASH
[3:09:39] <%kyh9> They're basically Force Church
[3:09:41] <ashenjuan25> Oh fuck what happens to Kreia in swtor
[3:09:45] <%kyh9> Very 40k
[3:09:47] <haitakaa> exile gets owned by the emperor
[3:09:48] <Bruno_Tropical> now play Jedi: Fallen Order
[3:09:50] <%CyanDeadEye> Honestly, if you play it with a non-MMO mindset, its pretty decent.
[3:09:52] <%wibbwobbler> aaaand fuck it
[3:09:54] <huskarl_zap> Total degenrate
[3:09:55] <ralphfromdk> And hey, at least it was the same emperor that did it, not just a random baddy from no where
[3:09:57] <Zouledge> did they ever confirm the spirt in sith warrior story was kreia @prime_name ?
[3:09:59] <%lotharrio> Who makes food now?!
[3:10:00] <+tearfuldevil> @mattynezz eh, revan in kotor1 is kind of nothing
[3:10:01] <aiutare47> @woolieversus play Republic Commando
[3:10:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ashenjuan25 the most brutal story for the blackest of all mentor characters. NOOTHIIIIIIIIIIING
[3:10:04] <%sonofthedeepsouth> We fucked now
[3:10:07] <%Neoepochx> @ashenjuan25 Nothing because she isn't mentioned in game. Bioware is buttmad about an interesting character.
[3:10:08] <SuperChumps> Revan was looking for a greater threat in deep space, this is them.
[3:10:09] <montgomerynw> They do talk about Kreia in the game. The CODEX says this "Entity" brought the Jedi to it's knees a few 100 years ago
[3:10:10] <%krispen_wa> nothing happens to kreia in swtor. some people think that this 'sith entity" was her, but that' s just theories
[3:10:10] <+Reaviar> gravestone
[3:10:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> >Work

[3:10:31] <+MagicBeanBurrito> a ship that is a gun
[3:10:33] <haitakaa> the sith emperor is there one who gave revan the star map
[3:10:35] <%Neoepochx> @Joestar1890 Yeah probably.
[3:10:43] <%sonofthedeepsouth> MAGUFFIN

[3:11:06] <TheLemuroid> Who would ever remove content from an mmo?
[3:11:07] <%kyh9> She's cute

[3:11:12] <%VCRUZZO> Acian us cool
[3:11:12] <Goraka91> A normal Sith? What DansGame
[3:11:14] <haitakaa> @liquiddinosaur he told revan how to find it

[3:11:20] <%krispen_wa> too bad she dies if you join the republic

[3:11:39] <%DatAsuna> Just those 3
[3:11:40] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus there is cut KOTOR 2 content where Atris is the Final Boss and takes the mantle of Darth Treya for herself.
[3:11:40] <+Deano8817> mandalorians are a thing
[3:11:44] <+pizzadeliveryman> BAtilla descendent
[3:11:45] <montgomerynw> It's implied that Kreia is in the game. The CODEX implies it pretty big
[3:11:46] <+MagicBeanBurrito> CANDO'S SKULL IS A QUEST ITEM
[3:11:49] <Jmann9218> Jedi Consular gets to met Bastila in a Holocron
[3:11:49] <Retinolgaming> Bioware pretends kotor 2 barely exists
[3:11:49] <TheLemuroid> I'm disappointed if you can't play as a droid
[3:11:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @haitakaa you know that place you grew up and trained? about 200 meters to the east there's some rocks? Its a door"
[3:11:50] <jorniev> god dammit
[3:11:51] <adyconker> Nihilus is a relic in the smuggler
[3:11:51] <%lotharrio> Mira is the MOST important Kappa
[3:11:52] <tolloponik> what happen to candor
[3:11:52] <startstoprepeat> does dlc cosmetics count @WoolieVersus
[3:11:53] <%DatAsuna> THere's some descendents of the party members but nothing important
[3:11:57] <+deadeyemax> KREIA IS CALLED AN EVIL SPIRIT
[3:12:00] <+pizzadeliveryman> Darth Bandon's head
[3:12:01] <%DatAsuna> Visas family .etc
[3:12:02] <donstylo> Mask
[3:12:02] <OmniSTylez> armor?
[3:12:03] <+Reaviar> mask

[3:12:16] <ralphfromdk> Republic visit to Taris gives a sad follow up to the promised land from Kotor 1 WoolieVersus
[3:12:17] <+ondri21> @WoolieVersus clan ordo is around
[3:12:19] <ashenjuan25> NotLikeThis
[3:12:26] <+metamyriad> No one tell them about kreia
[3:12:26] <%GrassCannon> There's a cult on Dromund Kaas that wants you to get Revan's mask iirc
[3:12:26] <+BioHunter> there is no significance
[3:12:28] <%WutangchickeN> Overall SWTOR sounds like a fuckin mess.

[3:12:45] <Jmann9218> Canderous is known as Mandalore the Preserver
[3:12:47] <adyconker> She was the Mandalore
[3:12:48] <+ondri21> @MrMoonGoose its edluded to be kreia its stupid regardless
[3:12:49] <donstylo> If my memory is right the MMO mentioned that Nihilus wasn't dead and can come back every time if his armor pieces come together.
[3:12:51] <+MagicBeanBurrito> It's a relic you steal
[3:12:52] <countgaculatv> You meet a Vizla lmao
[3:12:53] <+aishman> It's 300 years in the future dude.
[3:12:53] <+pizzadeliveryman> no
[3:12:55] <mattynezz> Mandos should have been with the Republic. Might have actually been interesting
[3:12:57] <%kyh9> I mean it's 300 years later
[3:12:57] <haitakaa> yeah there are sith cultists that worship revan as a grey Jedi
[3:12:58] <+RedKnightVI> No

[3:13:01] <+pizzadeliveryman> No
[3:13:01] <Goraka91> I mean everyone is long dead
[3:13:01] <%krispen_wa> Mandalore the Preserver is a good title
[3:13:01] <+nikivodka> no
[3:13:02] <+Reaviar> sith warrior
[3:13:02] <+aishman> Kreia is YEETED out
[3:13:02] <Doodle_Taco> No
[3:13:03] <+oda_flobunaga> isn't HK a raid boss?
[3:13:03] <Retinolgaming> Johnny Yong Bosch is a Mandalorian companion @WoolieVersus

[3:13:06] <+alphonseisbest> nope
[3:13:06] <+jjjkopf> FUCK no
[3:13:07] <phatmac16> No
[3:13:09] <huskarl_zap> Kreia should not show up
[3:13:09] <montgomerynw> It's implied that she appers in the game
[3:13:09] <$LightningLynx89> Kreia gets rightly yeeted
[3:13:10] <prime_name> Kreia shows up
[3:13:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> MOBILE GAME?
[3:13:10] <countgaculatv> Sith Warrior
[3:13:11] <%MrMoonGoose> @ondri21 look it up, that's confirmed Word of God not Kreia
[3:13:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> What mobile game?
[3:13:14] <Zouledge> it is implied in sith warrior story but no idea if confirmed
[3:13:14] <mattynezz> People THEORIZE a character is Kreia, but I don't tihnk so
[3:13:15] <%lotharrio> SFDebris has done a few story-line playthroughs of different classes. Maybe an hour total for any single one?
[3:13:16] <%DatAsuna> She's not mentioned
[3:13:16] <Archmortal> I wish they fucking kept Revan's name out of their mouths too
[3:13:18] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:13:20] <+therabbles> don't talk about my granny BibleThump
[3:13:22] <$LightningLynx89> Kreia sucks
[3:13:23] <TheLemuroid> Pull the lever!
[3:13:24] <montgomerynw> Not confimed but implied that she is in the game
[3:13:25] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:13:26] <%SouLucha> Keep her pure.
[3:13:26] <arkv01> do NOT sully granny
[3:13:27] <+sphiraki> for everyone saying yes, it is not kreia, that is bioware fanfiction
[3:13:28] <+Deano8817> @LiquidDinosaur galaxy of heroes, it's garbage
[3:13:29] <%spiritofmojave> Kreia needs to be kept SAFE (well ig the mobile game happened)
[3:13:29] <Doodle_Taco> SHE TOTALLY IS
[3:13:30] <%krispen_wa> KREIA'S WILL
[3:13:30] <%Gruhunchously> LEAVE GRANNY ALONE
[3:13:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> THE BOSS
[3:13:31] <blackskulldragon18> when I play it I never heared of her
[3:13:31] <%Neoepochx> @LightningLynx89 Stop being so butthurt. You are sounding like a Bioware astroturfer now.
[3:13:32] <phatmac16> KEEP GRANNY PURE
[3:13:32] <+Overlordkain> no, build a robot with her personality!
[3:13:33] <huskarl_zap> Meetra sturuk shows up as a ghost ITS THE WORST
[3:13:33] <NaturalGear> Kreia Pachinko when
[3:13:33] <OmniSTylez> best star wars character
[3:13:37] <+Reaviar> its implied becomes a spirit bound to darth baras
[3:13:38] <Pistachius> Mobile Game?
[3:13:39] <+ondri21> @WoolieVersus KREIA GETS TURNED INTO A BATTERY~!
[3:13:39] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus make a Kreia pachinko machine
[3:13:40] <%Order_of_Mystery> Big Kreia
[3:13:41] <%lotharrio> So what you're saying is... Kreia is a super computer.
[3:13:42] <ralphfromdk> @WoolieVersus Hey V, tell Woolie about the promised land sadness on Taris D.
[3:13:43] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LOOK AT THIS SCAR
[3:13:44] <+Kyma1020> Only The Boss Ai
[3:13:45] <%spiritofmojave> Everyone misinterpreting the Boss' will LUL
[3:13:46] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> she shows up in a pachinko machine
[3:13:49] <silverira> WHEN WILL YOU LEARN
[3:13:50] <%Ashenik1> its like watchin hobbit trylogy after LOTR
[3:13:51] <%VCRUZZO> Boss and Kreia are top teir as fuck
[3:13:52] <%redrins> does woolie not like the davey crocket? Kappa
[3:13:52] <%CyanDeadEye> Cutscene movie
[3:13:56] <%Gruhunchously> @huskarl_zap How can she possibly be a ghost. SHE'S AN ACTUAL FORCE WOUND!
[3:13:58] <donstylo> I heard rebels had a hologram of an old women that could be Kreia but I never watched the show.
[3:13:59] <$LightningLynx89> @Neoepochx Sorry I don't find her at all interesting, and just a writers vessel to not understand a setting
[3:13:59] <%wibbwobbler> can't wait to see rey disintegrate kreia
[3:14:00] <CodeSodaboi> I'd say Imperial Agent is worth playing
[3:14:01] <haitakaa> oh God taris
[3:14:02] <mikash91> Chuck of SF Debris has some good videos on the Dark side stories worth checking
[3:14:03] <%SouLucha> If you're not a fan of Kotor, it's probably good game.
[3:14:06] <%DatAsuna> I would sya the reverse
[3:14:08] <%krispen_wa> Agent is ACTUALLY GREAT tho
[3:14:09] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:14:10] <Joestar1890> Smuggler is so fun tho
[3:14:11] <montgomerynw> You can play it for free
[3:14:11] <%DatAsuna> The first stuff is the best stuff
[3:14:19] <%GrassCannon> Imp Agent storyline is great, but it's STILL an MMO
[3:14:23] <mattynezz> There is SO MUCH filler
[3:14:23] <prime_name> SWTOR is F2P now?
[3:14:24] <%Order_of_Mystery> i can't believe TOR is still going
[3:14:24] <huskarl_zap> @gruhunchously look up swtor exile ghost and she appears
[3:14:24] <haitakaa> it's interesting to see sith as a culture
[3:14:27] <jorniev> I don't care about swotor at all
[3:14:27] <+pizzadeliveryman> it is free without expansions
[3:14:27] <%CyanDeadEye> Rakghouls
[3:14:29] <TheLemuroid> Too many companies thought they could make a successful MMO
[3:14:32] <Airtighttrash> s m a r t f o r c e u s i n g r a k h g o u l s
[3:14:34] <%CyanDeadEye> Rakghouls everywhere!
[3:14:34] <Zouledge> @donstylo its a voice from a sith holocron and its never confirmed who it is
[3:14:35] <huskarl_zap> I'm not miss remembering this
[3:14:36] <BAM4LFE> it took chapter 3 for me to love agent, and that's like 30 to 40 hours in.
[3:14:38] <mattynezz> You find the Promised Land
[3:14:39] <%krispen_wa> Agent ACTUALLY has choices matter
[3:14:40] <+tearfuldevil> @SouLucha iif you only like kotor 1 its probably fine
[3:14:41] <CandideCamera> Your subscription style determines your deathstyle
[3:14:47] <ralphfromdk> The Promised Land storyline was hella sad D:
[3:14:49] <%Neoepochx> @TheLemuroid It was the time of the "WoW KILLER!"
[3:14:49] <%optimasmaximas> high republic LUL
[3:14:50] <+nikivodka> last few expansions are cool

[3:14:56] <donstylo> ah thanks
[3:14:58] <Airtighttrash> are a thing
[3:14:59] <+MagicBeanBurrito> You can be a bounty hunter and say "fuck you pay me"
[3:15:04] <Airtighttrash> k i l l m e
[3:15:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ralphfromdk i know i askeed you this but i forgot, what happened there? with the promise land?
[3:15:05] <%wibbwobbler> boo korra
[3:15:10] <$LightningLynx89> boo Korra
[3:15:10] <FoolproofDread> That they burned KOTOR as fuel to make.
[3:15:12] <%DatAsuna> It's closer to kotor than anything else but not that close
[3:15:13] <tolloponik> swotor is the korra of avatar
[3:15:13] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @TheFabledAble
[3:15:14] <%sonofthedeepsouth> a lil bit
[3:15:14] <phatmac16> boo korra
[3:15:15] <haitakaa> no it's definitely kotor
[3:15:15] <+pizzadeliveryman> YOU CAN BE A MANDOLORIAN
[3:15:16] <prime_name> yey Korra
[3:15:19] <Goraka91> I appreciate Korra's murder-suicide
[3:15:21] <TheLemuroid> Ignore incoming Korra opinions
[3:15:21] <Joestar1890> How did Sokka NOT get any progeny?
[3:15:22] <%DatAsuna> I'd compare it to dark souls 2
[3:15:30] <%spiritofmojave> ALL THE HITS
[3:15:33] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SOKKA WAS DONE DIRTY IS KORRA
[3:15:33] <%SouLucha> @tearfuldevil Sure, if you like the Star Wars for the Star Wars it's probably great. But if you liked Kotor for it's 1 and 2 this just makes me not care anymore.
[3:15:33] <%Neoepochx> Instead of Original Music.
[3:15:35] <%DatAsuna> It's hyper fanservicey
[3:15:37] <+cvp5127> MEMBER
[3:15:40] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SOKKA DESERVED BETTER
[3:15:41] <%Neoepochx> Memberberries overload
[3:15:42] <phatmac16> Just play KOTOR 2's theme
[3:15:43] <$TheFabledAble> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW IIIIT
[3:15:44] <%spiritofmojave> rememberrrr?
[3:15:45] <jorniev> that is the lamest possible way to do "your own thing"
[3:15:45] <+tearfuldevil> @Joestar1890 unfortunate boomerang accident as a youth
[3:15:48] <+Mondeiya> THE SITH EMPIRE HAS RETURNED
[3:15:51] <usurper_sos> You are just jerking us off at this point
[3:15:52] <Archmortal> "We don't need to rely on the old stuff too much, BUT WHAT IF WE RELY ON IT WAYYYY TOO MUCH"
[3:15:52] <+PlagueOfGripes> "shut up it's cool"
[3:15:52] <AllTheZibas> MEMBER I MEMBER
[3:15:54] <%Irridium> REMEMBER THIS?! CLAP! CLAP FOR THE THING YOU REMEMBER!
[3:15:55] <phatmac16> those trailers were pretty hype tho
[3:15:56] <mattynezz> I wwas SUPER hyped when the trailers came out, because I was still a huge Bioware fanboy
[3:15:59] <%Ashenik1> I think all hate for Korra comes from the season 2 and not the whole series
[3:15:59] <%CyanDeadEye> @LiquidDinosaur The people you help find the promise land, but it looks exactly like it should after an orbital bombardment
[3:16:04] <Doodle_Taco> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW IT
[3:16:05] <%wibbwobbler> IS THAT STAR WARS?
[3:16:06] <montgomerynw> Hey, one thing they do right. KOTOR 2's music is used really well in the game
[3:16:10] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> REMEMBER STAR WARS!!
[3:16:12] <$Invlux> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW IT
[3:16:16] <Retinolgaming> Johnny Yong Bosch is a Mandalorian companion @WoolieVersus
[3:16:17] <$LightningLynx89> @Ashenik1 Korra's only good season is the third one.
[3:16:25] <haitakaa> also that Jedi is bastillas descendant
[3:16:26] <+pizzadeliveryman> ughhhh
[3:16:28] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> V: I cried the whole time
[3:16:30] <%ggbhtg> Perhaps the Caucasity?
[3:16:31] <%sonofthedeepsouth> The audacity of this bitch
[3:16:32] <%spiritofmojave> why
[3:16:33] <%MrMoonGoose> The Force Entity in SWTOR straight-up says that her resting place was disturbed, and Malachor V is gone, so it can't possibly be her.
[3:16:33] <%VCRUZZO> YUP
[3:16:33] <+BioHunter> uuuggghhh]
[3:16:36] <prince_johnny_> Damn
[3:16:37] <Pistachius> the resistance theme is also a banger in my op
[3:16:37] <%sonofthedeepsouth> OOF
[3:16:37] <Joestar1890> I feel like they didn't have any original music that's good enough
[3:16:37] <arkv01> its exploitative
[3:16:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @CyanDeadEye so it WAS a super cool survival bunker but it got destroyed by the bombs? which i assume dropped the moment they got there?
[3:16:39] <phatmac16> LEAVE REVAN ALONE
[3:16:41] <arran_throttle> it is a good theme though...
[3:16:41] <%Gruhunchously> REMEMBER THIS!?!?!?!?!?!?!
[3:16:43] <prime_name> What was the Kotor 1 theme?
[3:16:44] <Airtighttrash> Bioware can't write
[3:16:45] <%DatAsuna> It's actually a remix but close enough
[3:16:45] <+oda_flobunaga> Avellone's favorite characters are Kreia and T3
[3:16:49] <LunarRemix> Even though KOTOR 2 made Revan as cool as they are now
[3:16:50] <Divryne> Little V talk about the Promised Land quests on Terrace. LUL
[3:16:55] <%Ashenik1> Korra is a good series.
[3:17:02] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:17:02] <blizzagan> He acts like a generic good guy jedi
[3:17:03] <%DatAsuna> oh this stuff
[3:17:06] <Goraka91> Alak? Wait really?
[3:17:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Lies and Slander
[3:17:08] <%brachydios777> I wonder why Bioware is failing
[3:17:09] <%Gruhunchously> Alek Squinqueguissimus
[3:17:09] <montgomerynw> The CODEX says the Entity brought the Jedi order to its knees a few hundred years before.
[3:17:11] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[3:17:11] <aiutare47> Play Republic Commando
[3:17:11] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> They also bring the theme back when Bastila shows up as a ghost
[3:17:12] <%jase__x> Mediocre at best
[3:17:13] <%krispen_wa> fucking Alek LUL
[3:17:14] <%Irridium> Alec LUL
[3:17:14] <mattynezz> I didn't know that LUL
[3:17:15] <%spiritofmojave> He added an M to make his name cooler LUL
[3:17:22] <%Neoepochx> @Goraka91 Yeah, Alek.
[3:17:23] <prince_johnny_> Alec? LUL
[3:17:26] <+pizzadeliveryman> Alek
[3:17:26] <+UberWolfman> DARTH ALEK
[3:17:30] <Goraka91> Man that's super dumb LUL
[3:17:33] <montgomerynw> Malek as a Jedi is Alek
[3:17:36] <%Neoepochx> Revan never was named was he?
[3:17:39] <%CyanDeadEye> @LiquidDinosaur Yep. Then they later die out because they run out of rakghoul serum, the rakghouls mutate so it doesn't work anyway, and radiation sterilizes them.
[3:17:39] <GoldeNOVA> D. Alek
[3:17:40] <+pizzadeliveryman> pretty lame
[3:17:40] <ralphfromdk> LiquidDinosaur Wrote you a message

[3:17:46] <+cvp5127> revanator
[3:17:47] <%Gruhunchously> Revan Kissed

[3:17:47] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[3:17:47] <%Jpshum> The Revan Christ
[3:17:48] <+tearfuldevil> Revanchist
[3:17:50] <%spiritofmojave> REVANCHRIST would be accurate too
[3:17:51] <Jmann9218> The Revenites
[3:17:51] <%krispen_wa> REVAN CHRIST AIR
[3:17:52] <Bruno_Tropical> As in Revanche
[3:17:53] <Goraka91> Revan Christ would be something strong LUL
[3:17:53] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REVAN CHRIST
[3:17:55] <prince_johnny_> Yea .....
[3:17:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> @LunarRemix literally anything cool about Revan is from Kotor 2. In Kotor 1 Revan has no real personality he's just "the old sith lord who's got amnesia now"
[3:17:56] <haitakaa> also the sith empire were behind the mandalorian war
[3:17:57] <%Irridium> Revanites I think they're called
[3:17:58] <%wibbwobbler> ISN'T REVAN COOL?
[3:17:59] <time_axis> tbh none of that expansion stuff seemed as good as the main class stories I've played
[3:18:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REVAN CHRIST IS GREAT
[3:18:05] <%CyanDeadEye> Yep
[3:18:06] <+pizzadeliveryman> Revanites are KOTOR 1 fanboys
[3:18:07] <%DatAsuna> Yup
[3:18:09] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus yep, this si comics stuff
[3:18:11] <%sonofthedeepsouth> REVAN IS IN STASIS FOR OUR SINS
[3:18:12] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[3:18:13] <mattynezz> This is comics
[3:18:17] <%Neoepochx> The KotOR comics is pretty good iirc.
[3:18:21] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Combination of everything
[3:18:24] <%krispen_wa> THAT'S RAD
[3:18:27] <%Neoepochx> I own the first few TPBs and liked them.

[3:18:40] <+Reaviar> its respect
[3:18:41] <jorniev> this is gonna be the same feel if/ woolie ever plays mass effect 3
[3:18:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> it IS a mandalorian mask
[3:18:52] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus It was in the Lore Recap video you watched
[3:19:02] <Doodle_Taco> Cool mask tho
[3:19:06] <%Gruhunchously> Well, the Mandalorian Wars were all kinds of screwed up
[3:19:07] <Goraka91> [T] is just a good look
[3:19:09] <%Irridium> Alek
[3:19:10] <%quinnage7> fucking Alek
[3:19:16] <%Irridium> what a fucking tool
[3:19:19] <haitakaa> it is a Mando mask
[3:19:19] <%brachydios777> Alek LUL
[3:19:22] <%NopeBadguy> ALL MY HOMIES JOINED THE WAR
[3:19:25] <%DatAsuna> Everyone? EVERYONE
[3:19:25] <%quinnage7> I never knew his real name was Alek
[3:19:29] <%Neoepochx> 1/6th
[3:19:30] <+Reaviar> exile got 1/6
[3:19:31] <+therabbles> classic Granny
[3:19:32] <%spiritofmojave> goddamn it Alek
[3:19:35] <+pizzadeliveryman> 1/6
[3:19:39] <%sonofthedeepsouth> sixth
[3:19:39] <%lotharrio> 1/6th of the total was Exile, the other was Revan.
[3:19:40] <Jmann9218> The Exile commands a 1/6
[3:19:52] <%Gruhunchously> Pretty much
[3:19:53] <%DatAsuna> The republic are BEGGING the jedi to join
[3:19:55] <haitakaa> so a sixth
[3:20:01] <blizzagan> The Exile got 1/6th of that
[3:20:02] <Goraka91> ''Nooo you can't just help the republic against it's enemies''
[3:20:04] <+oda_flobunaga> i got you fam
[3:20:05] <%lotharrio> Do we know about Saul at this point?
[3:20:06] <%Gruhunchously> Remember what Atton said?
[3:20:09] <usurper_sos> Revan has pull with the republic
[3:20:44] <%krispen_wa> MANDALORE THE ULTIMATE
[3:20:48] <%Neoepochx> You know what is "funny." How the Jedi were so hesitant in the Mandalorian Wars, but thousands of years later they become generals in the Clone Wars.
[3:21:01] <%lotharrio> Revan could never have predicted the weird mutants that were Nihilous and Exile.
[3:21:08] <Goraka91> @Neoepochx Ironic.
[3:21:09] <%Neoepochx> And they get killed in both conflics
[3:21:10] <NaturalGear> and then Mandalore started posting video games reviews on the internet
[3:21:19] <%krispen_wa> @neoepochx in a way, that's probably a result of the exile's teachings. they got corrupted in the opposite direction
[3:21:33] <+tearfuldevil> @Neoepochx considering how iffy being generals in the CLONE Wars is, i would have respected the jedi for staying out of it in the prequels
[3:21:34] <%Neoepochx> They took it too far in the other side in getting involved yeah.
[3:21:39] <%DatAsuna> Force visions I guess count as first hand??
[3:21:43] <%quinnage7> Can we talk about how Vrook was even more full of shit then we first though. NOT INTERVINING IN A GENOCIDAL WAR TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER WAR 300 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE
[3:22:09] <haitakaa> the mandalorians were being manipulated by the sith empire @woolieversus
[3:22:10] <jorniev> EXILE I REJECT MY JEDIDOM!
[3:22:10] <%krispen_wa> the 300 years only happened because of Revan. they would have attacked sooner
[3:22:11] <$Invlux> @quinnage7 HEY YEAH
[3:22:13] <TheLemuroid> Vrook didn't know better
[3:22:16] <%lotharrio> That's true. Vrook was taking a wait-and-see stance on something that didn't come into affect, for another 300+ years.
[3:22:17] <Goraka91> Here sip the evil juice
[3:22:18] <montgomerynw> SWTOR doesn't talk about that. Only the Revan book
[3:22:19] <+PlagueOfGripes> well, little of A and B
[3:22:25] <%DatAsuna> Nah they were dark before it, but yes they get overpowered
[3:22:26] <+PlagueOfGripes> they fall but not really until they get brainwashed
[3:22:27] <%Neoepochx> "Adds"
[3:22:28] <KaiserMario> Is SWTOR the Boruto of KOTOR?

[3:23:52] <emeraldskrull> There's only ONE star wars movie that matters and it's name is Solo.

[3:23:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> There is no sequel trilogy in Ba Sing Se

[3:27:17] <+tearfuldevil> @huskarl_zap kreia
[3:27:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @brachydios777 and the sequels have neither. I watched the Prequels recently and they were funny. I had a good time. I cannot forsee that happening with the prequels

[3:28:17] <%brachydios777> I do acknowledge that the sequels don‚Äôt work as a trilogy with the lack of planning, I like 7 and 8 but 9 ruins alot of freaking things

[3:28:42] <TheLemuroid> I figure she expected the masters to reject the exile
[3:28:43] <%lotharrio> Also, 4 Sith Lords killed in this game. Doing great.
[3:28:59] <KaiserMario> Sorry, maybe I missed it, but did anyone told Woolie that SIon falls in love with fem exile?

[3:29:15] <IcyTvTuber> @KaiserMario V did on korriban
[3:29:24] <KaiserMario> Ah thanks!
[3:29:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Neoepochx the Prequels made a time period where good stuff like spinoffs could exist. The sequels.......there's a reason the next trilogy is going to be like 500 years before. Its because nobody wants to fucking touch the time period during or after the sequels. its salted.
[3:29:36] <%shadowsofpain> Well yeah that's what force bonds do
[3:29:41] <%wibbwobbler> prequels missed the point of star wars. just hyper focuses on shit normies know
[3:29:44] <%Neoepochx> @LiquidDinosaur Agreed.
[3:29:47] <Goraka91> @LiquidDinosaur Yuuuup
[3:29:51] <IcyTvTuber> also @TheFabledAble i saw that critrole reference
[3:30:01] <BurdRightsActivist> @LiquidDinosaur Prequels actually expanded the world as opposed to Sequels going nowhere, and ultimately being kinda pointless
[3:30:05] <Doodle_Taco> She won either way
[3:30:07] <jorniev> my death here will reward me in ways you couldn't possibly imagine
[3:30:13] <%lotharrio> Her objective is to break you.

[3:30:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> What Can you do? Make a story about one of the bajillion kidnapped orphans on Exegol?
[3:30:20] <Goraka91> Prequels made for some great video games/eu stuff, Sequels...can't see that happening
[3:30:20] <%brachydios777> @wibbwobbler One is kinda pointless for alot of what happens after
[3:30:21] <%SouLucha> Kreia is a person, a Sith that just cares too much.
[3:30:26] <jorniev> SHE MADE YOU
[3:30:29] <TheLemuroid> What's wrong with the timeline after the sequels
[3:30:32] <%MrMoonGoose> @burdrightsactivist you aren't wrong, but ugh

[3:30:43] <prince_johnny_> Damn
[3:30:44] <%bigmacjack12> Cheer500 i cant recommend the kotor comics enough. It‚Äôs brings up some interesting topics, such as my personal favorite, the split between the more traditional and adherent Mandalorian crusaders, and the new press ganged and undisciplined neo-crusaders. The story follows a failed jedi padawan named Zayne Carrick who force abilities are described as being living proof that the force has a sense of humor.
[3:30:47] <%bigmacjack12> bigmacjack12's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[3:30:49] <%Gruhunchously> She makes several suggestions throughout the game that she doesn't intend to survive the end of the game.
[3:30:55] <T_Sasquatch> Yes and ? Im evil old woman
[3:30:56] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus She also impales herself with her lightsaber to hurt you through your bond if you do that
[3:31:03] <308caliber> ‚ÄúYou were afraid‚Äù changes to ‚ÄúYou have failed me‚Äù
[3:31:15] <%optimasmaximas> wait what alternate timelines?
[3:31:18] <jorniev> YOU ARE MY GREATEST FAILURE
[3:31:26] <%Neoepochx> The way Kreia gains influence is mainly wanting you to listen and at least attempt to take something out of her lessons. You don't have to agree, but at least consider what she has to say.
[3:31:27] <jorniev> says granny
[3:31:27] <IcyTvTuber> dark side and female timelines
[3:31:31] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Just the alternate endings
[3:31:31] <+tearfuldevil> @optimasmaximas choosing dark side or female
[3:31:46] <%wibbwobbler> just let kreia win
[3:31:52] <%Gruhunchously> 'You have failed me, completely and utterly"
[3:31:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:31:56] <%optimasmaximas> @tearfuldevil oh different dialogue stuff based on that? and endings i assume?
[3:31:59] <%Neoepochx> @bigmacjack12 I remember really liking Zayne in the first half of the KotOR comics, I never actually finished it.
[3:32:05] <jorniev> SHE WANTS YOU TO WIN
[3:32:05] <Goraka91> Nyaaaah i'm evil!
[3:32:07] <+koldfusion87> I was 11 when I got KOTOR2 and I remember being so confused cuz for some reason, I thought the game was set much further in the future and that Kreia was Bastila under a false name. Also KOTOR2 is the only RPG where I did a full playthrough as Dark Side and I was a BIG BOYE at the end of it
[3:32:11] <%lotharrio> Kreia tried real hard to find a third path. But uhh... maybe it's impossible.
[3:32:11] <%bigmacjack12> Oh hes amazing
[3:32:11] <BurdRightsActivist> NECRID MUST WIN
[3:32:12] <+tearfuldevil> @optimasmaximas yes
[3:32:13] <%brachydios777> @goraka91 Prequels have good spinoffs but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact the movies them selves aren‚Äôt good
[3:32:15] <+jiggy_snipe> oops all failures
[3:32:16] <Joestar1890> I needed more Sith hot takes personally
[3:32:17] <Second_Omega> Question, how does The exile become a force ghost?

[3:32:28] <%Neoepochx> @Second_Omega Bioware is bad at writing.
[3:32:28] <%Gruhunchously> HK says exactly that doesn't he
[3:32:34] <%lotharrio> @Second_Omega Shhh, don't worry about it.
[3:32:34] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 True, though they at least had SOME worldbuilding

[3:32:36] <$LightningLynx89> Jedi: Emotional restraint to prevent corruption from great power
[3:32:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> @bigmacjack12: were the comics written pre or post games?
[3:32:45] <+PlagueOfGripes> that's why I don't like the Gray Jedi video. it's very binary. you can only be a democrat or a republican and if you're a gray you're just a fence sitter. really simple minded
[3:32:45] <$Futurecity10> Bannerlord
[3:32:46] <TheLemuroid> I guess because Bioware ignores Kotor 2

[3:32:54] <$Futurecity10> BANNER SAGA
[3:32:54] <%Neoepochx> @LiquidDinosaur After 2 I'm pretty sure.
[3:32:54] <+Exicuren> Banner Saga
[3:32:59] <FirewallStorm> BANNER SAGA
[3:33:00] <vaderxyz1970> Bannersaga
[3:33:00] <Second_Omega> God fucking damnit.

[3:33:07] <phatmac16> BANNER SAGA
[3:33:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> Sion's VA wrote the script to Sexy Beast

[3:33:16] <Shwepie> @PlagueOfGripes That sounds like something a dirty fence sitter would say.

[3:33:23] <Goraka91> BIG BRAIN
[3:33:30] <Halospaz117> Thats rad
[3:33:31] <%lotharrio> Those are some important social checks.
[3:33:31] <%VCRUZZO> The Imortal Sundyr
[3:33:31] <+tearfuldevil> @Second_Omega they die, and swotor doens't want to get into how the exiles connectiion to the force works, so they're jsut a jedi, and when they die they come back as a ghost
[3:33:35] <%Neoepochx> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah, I thought that his "Gray Jedi" video had a lot of stretches. But I think the idea is that "IN UNIVERSE" the force pulls you in one direction or the other.
[3:33:37] <jorniev> woaaaah
[3:33:40] <%brachydios777> @goraka91 I like 8 for what it was gonna go for but than Disney caved in and 9 bacame what it is
[3:33:43] <hamahiroyuki> gaslighting end?
[3:33:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Sick stream lighting btw LUL
[3:33:55] <%wibbwobbler> thats right. the arrow just plant doubt in its mind
[3:33:58] <%krispen_wa> Old Man Logan?
[3:34:00] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 Yeah of the 3 8 at least tried something new
[3:34:01] <%lotharrio> Oh yeah, everyone is an inhuman.
[3:34:01] <Second_Omega> @tearfuldevil Greaaaaaaaat.
[3:34:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tearfuldevil yeah wouldnt the exile be like, an anti-ghost
[3:34:08] <$Invlux> the easiest way to kill 40K Orks
[3:34:24] <%Neoepochx> @Invlux Exterminatus?
[3:34:28] <%krispen_wa> So it's like American Gods?
[3:34:33] <Second_Omega> When the exile dies they Should end up like Vrook.
[3:34:33] <%seamoosethemoose> J E S U S M U T A N T
[3:34:36] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur they were written post releases of Kotor 1 and 2. They're great as backstory to Kotor, and also jsut a fun story in general
[3:34:41] <+agumon9000> SMT Demons
[3:34:42] <+oda_flobunaga> Soo Discworld Gods?
[3:34:48] <prime_name> Then how do the other realms exist?
[3:34:49] <%brachydios777> @goraka91 This is why I think Duel of the Fates would of been alot more interesting
[3:34:51] <+Bricespresso> so ork's in warhammer 40k
[3:34:53] <%bigmacjack12> Such a fun and great comic series
[3:34:58] <%lotharrio> Loki is great in that run. "Fuck! You're not dead! Stop dying, you idiots, we went over this!"
[3:35:06] <Doodle_Taco> Man one fucking comics make it so Odin is just a guy that is lying about being a god, its so bad
[3:35:09] <%optimasmaximas> wait you sayin they fucked?
[3:35:11] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, that sucks
[3:35:14] <%wibbwobbler> i want more cool star wars
[3:35:14] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 Anything is better than ''Palpatine is back...somehow''
[3:35:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> the story accomplished nothing
[3:35:22] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur i also recommend the Tales of the Jedi comics
[3:35:24] <%Neoepochx> @tearfuldevil How did you feel about the Rakghoul mini arc that lasted in 4 different time periods.
[3:35:27] <%krispen_wa> 4000 Years though
[3:35:30] <mattynezz> Yeah, but
[3:35:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tearfuldevil is that the one that's got Exar Kun and all that shit?
[3:35:43] <%SouLucha> BALANCE
[3:35:46] <%krispen_wa> 4000 YEARS
[3:35:48] <%WutangchickeN> hey guys use punctuation when you write shit lol.
[3:35:48] <%Gruhunchously> I guess Kreia was right then.
[3:35:49] <+michaelpichael> michaelpichael subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:35:54] <mattynezz> Nothing lasts forever
[3:35:55] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @huskarl_zap
[3:35:59] <jorniev> a new jedi order
[3:36:01] <%Neoepochx> @LiquidDinosaur That and Qul-Droma I think
[3:36:02] <$LightningLynx89> 4000 years is a good run
[3:36:04] <%bigmacjack12> That one was a bit weird with the rakghouls, but was interesting
[3:36:06] <+Reaviar> it keeps happening and they say itll be better this time but it keeps happening
[3:36:07] <%lotharrio> A thousand years of peace is... I mean, don't shit on it.
[3:36:08] <+tearfuldevil> @LiquidDinosaur probably but swotor don't want to get into that
[3:36:09] <Doodle_Taco> Kreia was actually right
[3:36:15] <+agumon9000> "Its like poetry....It rhymes."
[3:36:19] <+metamyriad> Tyranny is also real good
[3:36:27] <jorniev> 4000 years counts for something
[3:36:29] <%Neoepochx> Torment is "Kino"
[3:36:30] <%brachydios777> @goraka91 That part is really bad too, Johnson should of had 9 for a more cohesive ending, I know he can write well like with Knives Out.
[3:36:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Neoepochx i know lots about Kotor so Exar Kun and Qel Droma are sort of this weird vague thing in my head i know are important but know no details about
[3:36:31] <KaiserMario> But prequels happened befor KOTOR, in our world i mean
[3:36:32] <%DatAsuna> Off-air is the way for planescape tbh
[3:36:36] <%VCRUZZO> well no it happened even b4 then. They become stuck up in there ways for a while b4 CW
[3:36:39] <+r_Foeburden87> wat game
[3:36:45] <arkv01> "I would love it but not pushing haha *nudge*"
[3:36:45] <%Gruhunchously> Torment is Chris Avellone unleashed
[3:36:47] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus what can change the nature of a man
[3:36:49] <+oda_flobunaga> Torment is Avallone's true masterpiece
[3:36:51] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 All I know is have a trilogy planned out before you make it
[3:36:51] <%optimasmaximas> planescape torment
[3:36:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG EXCITED
[3:36:55] <+Bricespresso> thats that cult fallowing game
[3:36:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Avellone is making Dying Light 2 get hype
[3:36:57] <jorniev> I do not want an lp of that
[3:36:57] <Rixstarian> I think Planescape is on sale too
[3:36:57] <%Irridium> There's a reason people call it the best written video game ever made
[3:37:02] <aiutare47> Republic commando
[3:37:06] <+Bricespresso> people love that game
[3:37:06] <$LightningLynx89> 4000 years counts for a lot. It's the longest time the Star Wars galaxy has been at peace. Then what you have 30 years of Galactic Empire rule, before the Republic and Jedi return to enact peace.
[3:37:07] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus have yall thought about playin another voiced rpg for the stream???? >_>
[3:37:19] <%lotharrio> I think I'm gonna get Planescape.
[3:37:25] <TheLemuroid> Do you need your hips guided to play Planescape?
[3:37:31] <%kyh9> Close, but gets FUCKED into a goofy villain in the end
[3:37:32] <%DatAsuna> Vaylin, they mean
[3:37:35] <%wibbwobbler> and then she attacks you with THREE FLOATING PURPLE LIGHTSABERS
[3:37:39] <%brachydios777> @goraka91 Exactly, Filoni should have reigns over the franchise
[3:37:43] <%Neoepochx> @LiquidDinosaur Yeah, Tales clarifies that a lot. Exar Kun gets brought back in the Jedi Academy Trilogy books (unrelated to the game)
[3:37:48] <Goraka91> @brachydios777 Amen
[3:37:48] <mattynezz> He isn't. He's a charismatic person, but that's it
[3:37:53] <Rixstarian> @thelemuroid It's a CRPG, so no, but you may not experience everything in one run
[3:37:54] <%kyh9> Basically
[3:37:58] <+oda_flobunaga> the HD version of Torment now works with the old restored content mod
[3:38:00] <Halospaz117> Preferred status it's called
[3:38:01] <%DatAsuna> Disagree
[3:38:01] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[3:38:10] <%DatAsuna> THe agent story is better than KotFE
[3:38:11] <Joestar1890> SWTOR is almost completely free to play now, all old expansions are free now
[3:38:16] <time_axis> IMO Imperial Agent is the best
[3:38:19] <%kyh9> Valkorion is almost there, but they make him cartoonishly evil in the en
[3:38:20] <%kyh9> d
[3:38:24] <%krispen_wa> The Agent Story is better than anything in SWTOR
[3:38:26] <prince_johnny_> The agent story is pretty good
[3:38:28] <%MrMoonGoose> Imp Agent is so good
[3:38:30] <%DatAsuna> Inquisitor's also better to me too
[3:38:32] <+Reaviar> but then you dont get to play as sith warrior who makes multiple jedi fall simply by existing
[3:38:32] <KaiserMario> Ah yes, remember "Johan Bach", the final bad guy from Bleach?
[3:38:35] <+pizzadeliveryman> its like 20+ bucks
[3:38:41] <Goraka91> Shout out to fuck boi Baras
[3:38:42] <BurdRightsActivist> KOTOR REMAKE?
[3:38:42] <Joestar1890> expect KOTOR 1 quality writing
[3:38:43] <%AnAsianToaster> that's because you're a good person woolie
[3:38:44] <+oda_flobunaga> Fallout NV
[3:38:46] <prime_name> Same
[3:38:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> Should you always play Light Side in SWTOR?
[3:38:53] <%lotharrio> Like JADE EMPIRE
[3:38:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1272752298469609473?s=20
[3:38:56] <%brachydios777> Fallen Order
[3:38:58] <emeraldskrull> Force Unleashed is great
[3:38:58] <%DemonOfSalt> Fallout NV highly recommended.
[3:39:00] <%MrMoonGoose> @liquiddinosaur hell no
[3:39:00] <%DatAsuna> Jade empire is rad
[3:39:00] <+HollowMan190> on to Yakuza
[3:39:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> cough cough Fallen Order cough coug
[3:39:01] <%krispen_wa> Agent is good from start to finish
[3:39:04] <startstoprepeat> you can play everything solo in tor, i think even the raids got single player modes eventually
[3:39:04] <JetpackMcQuack> :)
[3:39:08] <%lotharrio> New Vegas is pretty good, too.
[3:39:16] <%VCRUZZO> She ain't wrong
[3:39:17] <Zouledge> @lotharrio i would be so happy if Jade empire got some love, it deserves it
[3:39:17] <Second_Omega> NV is another fantastic game
[3:39:21] <%Neoepochx> Ain't wrong.
[3:39:23] <prime_name> Not wrong
[3:39:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @MrMoonGoose oh? i heard that for sith characterrs, "light side" basically amounts of "reasonable lawful evil"
[3:39:25] <%wibbwobbler> yes
[3:39:27] <Goraka91> I'm Revan :)
[3:39:27] <+strakillias> Sith Warrior story is better than eternal throne if you sub b/c of exp boosts allowing you to skip all sidequests
[3:39:27] <%Gruhunchously> Star Wars fans have a problem with obsessing over how big people's numbers are.
[3:39:28] <knotsundownsyndrome> @startstoprepeat raids get singleplayer now?
[3:39:30] <%brachydios777> Not wrong
[3:39:30] <TheRealTunnelSnakes> New vegas is the best fallout game
[3:39:30] <%kyh9> It's not just 'yours', it's YOU
[3:39:32] <%SouLucha> You love yourself, right?
[3:39:33] <werunos> yeah 100 percent
[3:39:33] <knotsundownsyndrome> if that's the case, i might go back

[3:39:41] <%AnAsianToaster> he stood in that cave really cool though
[3:39:42] <%DatAsuna> Red is 10
[3:39:43] <%redrins> red is great in the manga
[3:39:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> RED IS A NON-ENTITY

[3:39:51] <%MrMoonGoose> @liquiddinosaur yeah, but being the one sane Sith is really, really fun

[3:39:52] <Warfey> limesLUL
[3:39:53] <Joestar1890> @liquiddinosaur only if you don't want to be a cartoonist asshole, also you'll miss out on some fun dialogue/interactions as a dark side character
[3:39:54] <%SouLucha> "Words are meaningless."
[3:39:55] <+donpatrondx> thank you
[3:39:55] <%Neoepochx> Red is nothing. Him being brought back in SuMo was nice.
[3:39:57] <Ids560> I mean I think the characterization revan gets in kotor 2 is cool
[3:39:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> Green is better anyways.
[3:39:57] <%VCRUZZO> Yeah
[3:39:58] <+Overlordkain> Red took it when he beat his ass.
[3:39:59] <redamber1> True
[3:40:00] <Shwepie> Red punched Lance in the face and stole it.
[3:40:00] <+Bricespresso> YOURE RIGHT
[3:40:02] <prime_name> Cynthia is the best pokemon character
[3:40:03] <Doodle_Taco> It is, but Red did it cooler
[3:40:05] <%AnAsianToaster> can one steal a theme tho?
[3:40:07] <phatmac16> Red in SuMo is cool
[3:40:08] <%krispen_wa> Cynthia is hot
[3:40:09] <%optimasmaximas> @prime_name FACTS
[3:40:10] <+donpatrondx> why is that childin the mountains anyway!?
[3:40:11] <$Invlux> It's the KANTO CHAMPION THEME
[3:40:12] <%CyanDeadEye> Cynthia is great
[3:40:13] <$LightningLynx89> Yeah but who did Lance lose to? Oh right Red.
[3:40:14] <+alphonseisbest> CYNTHIA GANG
[3:40:15] <+AverageBlubber> Red WON that theme!
[3:40:16] <%Neoepochx> 20 Year old Red is cool
[3:40:16] <Airtighttrash> Revan is only good because of the context of Kotor 2
[3:40:16] <mikash91> Lance wasn't strong enough to keep it : P
[3:40:18] <time_axis> Red had a Pikachu
[3:40:19] <mattynezz> That's funny, Red was RIGHT THERE when it played
[3:40:20] <BAM4LFE> he stole that song like he stole his wins
[3:40:22] <IcyTvTuber> the fandom in response: Then you shall die braver than most
[3:40:23] <YakumoYomi> Cynthia is the best champion, in my opinion.
[3:40:24] <+cvp5127> red cucked the theme
[3:40:25] <%krispen_wa> Cynthia is the only champion who kicked my ass
[3:40:25] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL

[3:40:35] <$LightningLynx89> Too bad Red lost to a ten year old
[3:40:35] <BurdRightsActivist> That's NOT EVEN the BEST CHAMP theme
[3:40:36] <Joestar1890> Red kinda stole it though, mainly because people didn't like Lance as much
[3:40:37] <jorniev> doesn't it plays at the intro of the game?
[3:40:37] <+agumon9000> Champion Cynthia is the best
[3:40:37] <+kaiber132> @woolieversus apparently Reven was meant to appear in clone wars s3 but was cut. he was voiced and everything

[3:40:55] <%brachydios777> Those were cool
[3:40:56] <%lotharrio> Red? Oh! Red. My mind went to SaGa Frontier.
[3:40:59] <Airtighttrash> Bioware wrote shit and Obsidian brushed it off and fixed it's plot
[3:41:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Virgin Lance theme vs CHAD CYNTHIA GANG
[3:41:04] <%Neoepochx> @CanadianAnimatorGuy Sad...but not unwarrented.
[3:41:12] <%krispen_wa> cynthia has a good theme, good team, and is generally competent and shows up in more than her own game
[3:41:14] <Doodle_Taco> CYNTHIA GANG RISE UP
[3:41:15] <+jjjkopf> New Pokemon Snap, a name that will not get old
[3:41:18] <Joestar1890> Lance isn't that great, but I agree, it's Lance's theme first
[3:41:19] <akman14> Unfortunately Woolie still hasn't learned of what happened to HK

[3:42:19] <$NoWayRyanTatum> FFXV does that shit in its DLC
[3:42:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> in a MMO nothing can matter
[3:42:23] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It lets the agent join one of the villains
[3:42:26] <%AnAsianToaster> you could play the dlc of new vegas and never actually follow the main storyline
[3:42:27] <%Neoepochx> Cynthia is the best.
[3:42:30] <Rixstarian> @zeow31 Planescape is a good appetiser to Disco Elysium
[3:42:33] <%optimasmaximas> CYNTHIA BEST CHAMP, HILDA BEST PROTAG CAUSE BOOTY SHORTS
[3:42:34] <%Irridium> I'll be honest I did that ending for Far Cry 4 first and just never went back LUL
[3:42:35] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Their newer Rpgs have been stellar as well. Pillars of eternity Deadfire is a fuckin TREAT of dialogue, choices, mystery and phylosophy. The main antagonist of it is VERY similar to Kreia and yet comes at it from a very different angle
[3:42:45] <%CyanDeadEye> Wheel with different "Tones"
[3:42:52] <+alphonseisbest> SO FF14
[3:42:52] <%krispen_wa> Agent ACTUALLY has multiple endings and paths. it's GREAT
[3:42:55] <$TheFabledAble> "antagonist"
[3:42:57] <Doodle_Taco> Route 209 best theme
[3:42:57] <+oda_flobunaga> Keith David is best party member in PST
[3:43:00] <Ids560> Tyranny's pretty good
[3:43:00] <zeow31> @rixstarian Never played Disco.... Is it worth the trip ?
[3:43:01] <%DatAsuna> FF14 is very good
[3:43:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> it doesn't. 14 handles it well ONCE so far
[3:43:04] <%Order_of_Mystery> ESO isn't bad either
[3:43:05] <Goraka91> @Irridium Honestly it's better than joining the Golden Path lunatics LUL
[3:43:06] <Zouledge> ff14 is good
[3:43:08] <%DatAsuna> old dono
[3:43:11] <%krispen_wa> FF14 gets amazing
[3:43:11] <jorniev> FULL HALO COOP LP
[3:43:13] <+pizzadeliveryman> ff14 is ok
[3:43:15] <%spiritofmojave> it's a solid structure with 14
[3:43:15] <%DSD24> I wish DeadFire was better on PS4
[3:43:23] <+alphonseisbest> FF14 SHB GANG GANG
[3:43:24] <Rixstarian> @zeow31 100%
[3:43:26] <%Neoepochx> ...
[3:43:28] <%Klefth> FFXI also had FANTASTIC story. The problem is that the whole genre has been tainted by WoW's horrendous presentation and then the million other cheap korean wannabes
[3:43:28] <%krispen_wa> Shadowbringers is the best FF story since 10
[3:43:36] <%DatAsuna> Nah it happens during stasis
[3:43:38] <%kyh9> It's pretty stupid tbh
[3:43:41] <%brachydios777> Isn‚Äôt ff14 pretty good now?
[3:43:41] <+oda_flobunaga> garbage
[3:43:42] <%Neoepochx> What even is that word soup that guy tried to have you read?
[3:43:48] <%wibbwobbler> don't
[3:43:50] <PrideOfFiddles> That sounds like Kingdom hearts LUL
[3:43:51] <Sagata_> that book is shit
[3:43:51] <zeow31> @ids560 Tyranny is interesting because you're kinda forced to be a bad guy due to circumstances
[3:43:53] <%Irridium> don't
[3:43:56] <%Neoepochx> @PrideOfFiddles So true.
[3:44:01] <%VCRUZZO> just don't
[3:44:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> Does Dark Revan ruin girls' dark auditions by runnng around them
[3:44:07] <%krispen_wa> STAHP
[3:44:14] <BurdRightsActivist> Light Revan and NEGA-REVAN
[3:44:17] <Goraka91> Haven't played Tyranny but interested by the premise, any good?
[3:44:17] <T_Sasquatch> Revan is a mary sue. There i said it
[3:44:20] <%LiquidDinosaur> does Revan go sorry toots but looks like your order's up!"
[3:44:20] <jorniev> you end up killing revan and hk
[3:44:22] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Good revan isn't alive, he's just a force voice
[3:44:27] <+oda_flobunaga> in Tyranny, you are part of an evil system, but you can still be a good person at heart
[3:44:27] <%krispen_wa> But Revan is OUR mary sue
[3:44:31] <%DatAsuna> so it's not physical
[3:44:33] <Shwepie> But physically splitting is how you get Piccolo, the best dad.
[3:44:38] <ArroxasPlays> while the author is highly controversial I think u should see the philosophy of kreia video and his other star wars ones and no need to see anything else from him. maybe the Evangelion one.
[3:44:40] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:44:44] <BurdRightsActivist> ACKHUALLY

[3:44:45] <%Neoepochx> Ackshully.
[3:44:49] <%Klefth> @brachydios777 Been pretty good for years. The trash fire started getting good around 2011, then died, then it got bad again, and then it's gone nowhere but up since Heavensward
[3:45:10] <Rixstarian> @klefth FFXI is not kind to people w/ obligations. The game world lives w/o the player, so you have to play on its schedule
[3:45:12] <%Neoepochx> That is actually pretty Pog
[3:45:16] <%krispen_wa> Stormblood's story kinda sucked tho
[3:45:19] <%DatAsuna> IMagine if luke redeemed vader
[3:45:19] <zeow31> @oda_flobunaga What I like is that being a good guy in Tyranny has an actual cost where being evil is easier
[3:45:24] <%brachydios777> @klefth That‚Äôs what I thought, should be coming out to Xbox this year right?
[3:45:28] <%DatAsuna> And the rest of the galaxy goes "you did WHAT?"
[3:45:30] <Halospaz117> Hoo boy the catch up is real
[3:45:31] <%VCRUZZO> Of Course they do. He brought war to most of the planets
[3:45:37] <%DatAsuna> "bullshit"
[3:45:43] <%DatAsuna> fair
[3:45:43] <%VCRUZZO> can't blame them
[3:45:46] <%optimasmaximas> can woolie link that 3 hour cutscene?
[3:45:56] <%krispen_wa> Sundown?
[3:45:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:46:03] <blizzagan> Do they know Bastilla had a kid with Revan tho??
[3:46:04] <%Klefth> @Rixstarian FFXI changed a fuckton since 2010. The whole thing is pretty much soloable these days
[3:46:04] <%optimasmaximas> SUN IS DOWN
[3:46:12] <+cvp5127> unlimited saber works
[3:46:12] <%hzflank> worth telling Woolie about Arren Kae theory?

[3:46:21] <$Invlux> just got an email from my bank saying they're going to close early for Juneteenth? Nice
[3:46:22] <blizzagan> Did they ever get corrected that Revan fucked Bastilla?

[3:46:36] <Rixstarian> @klefth Well, I mean for the authentic experience. Also, JP midnight quest locks & NM spawn windows
[3:46:39] <%krispen_wa> It's SUPER hard
[3:46:40] <%MrMoonGoose> @datasuna did you happen to publish that supercutscene video anywhere?
[3:46:41] <+jiggy_snipe> a boomerang is one thing
[3:46:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> ITS NELO
[3:46:45] <Graxe_> And Kreia doesn't just use one, she uses three
[3:46:48] <%Klefth> @Rixstarian Which is kind of a sad thought considering the most special thing about XI was the community... but hey, it's actually accessible now
[3:46:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @WoolieVersus Like Nelo
[3:47:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> Kreia does what we all want to: mind sword fighting
[3:47:15] <%Klefth> @Rixstarian Most NM spawns that matter were turned into forced spawns by trading in items
[3:47:18] <%wibbwobbler> die...
[3:47:21] <Rixstarian> @klefth Yeah. It didn't go to Western convenience routes
[3:47:22] <BYAKURENLOVER763> all with one hand!
[3:47:33] <$StaceMcGate> Is this post discussion going on youtube?
[3:47:40] <%spiritofmojave> You expect just another case of the Darth Sion fight, more so through words but it's totally both with that Vergil 2 phase
[3:47:45] <playdohface> I‚Äôm sure someone did this in one of the books
[3:47:50] <Rixstarian> @klefth I was a Monster Hunter in FFXI before Monster Hunter. I wanted everything dead once
[3:47:53] <%krispen_wa> is FFXI's story as good as FFXIV's HW and ShB?
[3:47:57] <%DatAsuna> forgot that line lol
[3:48:01] <%AnAsianToaster> oh boy he's crazy
[3:48:09] <%DatAsuna> Simp Lord
[3:48:19] <Rixstarian> @krispen_wa Fucking great. Especially Chains of Promathia
[3:48:35] <%wibbwobbler> good stuff
[3:48:36] <+kaiber132> @woolieversus apparently Reven was meant to be in s3 of clone wars, but was cut. was voiced and everything.
[3:48:36] <Rixstarian> @krispen_wa Wings of the Goddess is neat as hell too
[3:48:37] <$Invlux> @StaceMcGate it's likely some of it, but probably not all. A good deal of the post-Dokapon got added to the final anime ep
[3:48:37] <%VCRUZZO> mmm, boy does he want sip to quench his thirst

[3:50:06] <%Order_of_Mystery> LilV podcast guest?
[3:50:06] <+theaceclaw> Valkorian is a pretty cool character but nowhere near as cool as anything from KOTOR 1/2. Making Revan brainwashed just ruins his character imo.
[3:50:07] <$TheFabledAble> Cheer1000 Hey woolie Listening to the discourse of Kreia I realized a bunch of similarities with them and the main "antagonist" of one of obsidian's newest RPGs Pillars of eternity, especially its sequel deadfire. Basically a character who was a pillar upholding the status quo, recognizes the lack of progress this was leading to, and thus became the villain to topple that status quo at the durress of the others of their group who were content with things staying as is because they were in power
[3:50:07] <Rixstarian> @klefth Yeah, I lost the FFXI bug when I had to collect 75 Isgebind Hearts for Masamune, & once I held it, I was like "I think I'm done w/ this game"

[3:51:47] <%wibbwobbler> woolieSMUG
[3:51:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Planescape Torment has a character who experiences the multiverse through countless "branches". Female characters that all fit a mentor, motherly, or other caretaker-style archetype. These women don't even realize that they are an extension of someone else until a certain event later in the game.
[3:51:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Almost every game Chris Avellone has worked on since then has had 1 or 2 characters that very plausibly could be one of these branches, most notable being Kreia.
[3:51:56] <Doodle_Taco> Thanks V
[3:51:57] <Halospaz117> Man, I'm getting that feeling when you finish a long game you really love, where you feel a bit sad afterwards, that's how good this LP is
