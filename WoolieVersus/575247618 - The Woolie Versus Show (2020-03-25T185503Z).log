[0:00:30] <Kingjoker310> fixed
[0:00:30] <Amardeux> so try putting on the dancer dress on Fanny, since his name is in the item description
[0:00:30] <Visorak6> Mission is a go
[0:00:31] <%Irridium> doog
[0:00:38] <StarlitStunner> stripStare
[0:00:46] <alrobot2014> @Amardeux it said required gender female
[0:00:46] <derap41> Its the best of the lot
[0:00:46] <Gruhunchously> If you have Visas with you, she just flat out refuses if you ask to dance.
[0:00:50] <Amardeux> ah okay
[0:01:14] <Amardeux> weird that it would still include fanny's name even if you picked a dude
[0:01:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mihn would do that
[0:01:28] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Have fun no longer canon mandolorian facts. Mandalorians iconic arsenal was developed in the mandalorian war to fight jedi. The flamethrower and rockets in particular, cause you can't parry those like a blaster. They also made a laser shotgun.
[0:01:35] <%gatorafan> sounds like a job for Minh
[0:01:49] <illicitdonut> Hello from NZ LOCKDOWN!
[0:01:50] <LeafarOznolam> good to know
[0:01:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> like the laser shotgun the trandoshans use?
[0:02:00] <Amardeux> @illicitdonut ello ello
[0:02:01] <+Superspider51> now what color is it?
[0:02:15] <Gruhunchously> I thought I heard stuttering, but it was just the strings in the OST
[0:02:17] <Amardeux> malaysian lockdown got extended to april 14th
[0:02:33] <%humbelpie> DUAL WIELD!
[0:02:46] <Redblood801> Don't hit the camera
[0:02:46] <+Bluemanzee> Woolie is now OP PogChamp
[0:02:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:03:00] <illicitdonut> @Amardeux doodBro
[0:03:11] <Gruhunchously> God, don't encourage him.
[0:03:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> the guy in the parking lot had 2 upgraded umbrellas
[0:03:24] <theKingRamses> it's just a bigger investment with 2 seperate ones
[0:03:37] <siamzero94> Double-bladed is higher DPS
[0:03:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> i remember i had my off-hand just be max crit chance and stun on crit
[0:03:39] <indig0bird> Double makes more raw damag
[0:04:02] <NaturalGear> single has more accuracy and defense
[0:04:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> HK-47 FUCKING MURDERS WITH 2 PISOTLS
[0:04:22] <Gruhunchously> Two wives and two knives
[0:04:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> Pistols even
[0:04:30] <Visorak6> This has been a long standing balance issue in tabletop systems in general
[0:04:37] <Chatterbox1991> i think double weapons have better accuracy
[0:04:46] <+mankeyfigh> Did they get a different lightsaber?
[0:04:53] <+SolidusRex> Single sabers also offer better defense
[0:04:55] <muzaki_lopez> they did, a single
[0:05:08] <%illicitdonut> illicitdonut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Take my money
[0:05:09] <Gruhunchously> ooh
[0:05:11] <%Irridium> I hear you but consider:double bladed looks cooler
[0:05:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> cyan
[0:05:18] <DavidDredd84> cyan
[0:05:21] <+zabando> cyan
[0:05:25] <Gruhunchously> sion
[0:05:33] <Redblood801> The canon color
[0:05:35] <+Superspider51> Darth Cyan
[0:05:39] <gruulmagebeast> there are double bladed scimitars in dnd now which makes it feel like im a kotor character
[0:05:43] <%illicitdonut> woolieVS
[0:05:48] <siamzero94> cyan? there is not a speck of green in it
[0:05:53] <theKingRamses> what a weird stance with only one hand
[0:06:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> I hate how the new canon makes the red sabers be because you TORTURE THE CRYSTAL. it should just be that it was the easiest one to fabricate and then it became a tradition
[0:06:01] <Gruhunchously> This is the default you get if you don't choose a saber color
[0:06:01] <Redblood801> True Jedi
[0:06:01] <am_omega> She is trying to two hand it though LUL
[0:06:04] <Graywolf_the_45th> biggest light side
[0:06:11] <+mankeyfigh> SOWRD
[0:06:19] <+Bluemanzee> Kreia is just super delayed light side
[0:06:21] <startstoprepeat> she turns the lightsaber on and just starts taking damage from the light of it
[0:06:24] <Superdandy96> Lol, that’s right she still missing a hand LUL
[0:06:26] <DavidDredd84> I gave her green but blue looks pretty good. She looks like female alec guinness
[0:06:29] <preppyposs> she does not care
[0:06:36] <Gruhunchously> Granny is protective
[0:06:46] <leonsnixon> Ignored
[0:06:53] <Gruhunchously> WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER
[0:06:55] <+SolidusRex> CAN'T WAKE UP
[0:06:55] <siamzero94> why is fanny losing his mask randomly?
[0:07:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> BAKA
[0:07:11] <leonsnixon> SAVE ME
[0:07:12] <Gruhunchously> Oh he actually said it
[0:07:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> your kath hounds are very drunk sir
[0:07:16] <SinnerBeta> dirty hooman
[0:07:24] <Redblood801> Ah fuck it
[0:07:28] <Superdandy96> Fanny’s trying boost his confidence
[0:07:36] <am_omega> Should have danced for him Kappa
[0:07:42] <gruulmagebeast> KAAAA CHII KOOOOO

[0:08:33] <SinnerBeta> handmaiden looking like an abomination in the background lol
[0:08:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> i mean if he trades with Citadel Station Goto would mysteriously not rob those shipments...
[0:08:39] <gruulmagebeast> sley-a aron
[0:09:11] <iamyungdannow> Awe yeah!
[0:09:15] <iamyungdannow> Awe yeah!!
[0:09:16] <+taggerung403> handmaiden looks like a rule 63 immortan joe
[0:09:32] <%Yung_Booker> wooliePOYO
[0:09:43] <iamyungdannow> I’ve been bing watching the vods. KOTOR II is my jimmy jams

[0:10:05] <Gruhunchously> We haven't left the room...
[0:10:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> TALK TO THE BITH
[0:10:15] <SinnerBeta> the puppers are just sleepy
[0:10:19] <iamyungdannow> Crume wur
[0:10:20] <Amardeux> the Bith LUL
[0:10:21] <Gruhunchously> They're just sleepy
[0:10:26] <leonsnixon> Bith
[0:10:39] <siamzero94> PLAY JIZZ, that's all your people are good for
[0:10:47] <Kirlrik> lips made for jizz
[0:10:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> SHUT UP EGGHEAD, FILL MY EARS WITH JIZZ
[0:10:57] <Gruhunchously> You can just murder this guy for no reason, it's hilarious
[0:10:58] <Ashenik1> Why Woolie-Bait has so many unnecessary clothes on?
[0:11:06] <Heyestus> Bith please
[0:11:10] <Amardeux> Bith > Sith
[0:11:16] <+BlockingDisabled> Calling a Bith a 'flute-player' seems kind of... racist, IMO.
[0:11:23] <iamyungdannow> @ashenik1 it’s armor.... unfortunately
[0:11:38] <BlackOrchidKI> @BlockingDisabled More of a stereotype, I'd think.
[0:11:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> All bith are music nerds. Everyone with a bald melon head is a music nerd.
[0:11:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> See: Fantano
[0:12:06] <%theredfox930000> little v is force projecting himself to to woolie's apartment
[0:12:07] <Jaku2011> I mean has anyone ever seen a bith without a flute
[0:12:15] <BlackOrchidKI> We just did, silly Kappa
[0:12:19] <iamyungdannow> Oh wait! I didn’t actually see what she was wearing. I thought she still had her robes on @ashenik1
[0:12:23] <SinnerBeta> @LiquidDinosaur Pat isn't a music nerd tho
[0:12:26] <iamyungdannow> Welp
[0:12:30] <Gruhunchously> Robots only
[0:12:40] <Jaku2011> I dont think we did
[0:12:46] <Ashenik1> @iamyungdannow Kappa
[0:12:50] <Gruhunchously> A flophouse
[0:12:55] <%LiquidDinosaur> ......i just checked and its apparently not canon that Ki Adi Mundi fucks anymore
[0:13:03] <Amardeux> i wonder if woolie will remember will remember to swap handmaiden's outfit back LUL
[0:13:06] <Gruhunchously> There are some good quests to be found in here
[0:13:20] <Gruhunchously> @Amardeux "Remember"
[0:13:25] <+mankeyfigh> PING CRIMSON
[0:13:26] <Ashenik1> @LiquidDinosaur so whats the point of Star Wars anymore...
[0:13:26] <Superdandy96> Gotta peace out. See ya’ll later

[0:14:27] <+Walopoh> EEeeeyyy
[0:14:27] <PlainSimpleTailor> MISTER GARIBALDI
[0:14:27] <Gruhunchously> It's the same guy, isn't it?
[0:14:28] <Redblood801> But they don't
[0:14:33] <OkamiDude15> LUL
[0:14:37] <iamyungdannow> Jesus! He can bring it down a little
[0:14:42] <%Binary_Fireball> his wings must be tired
[0:14:50] <MyNameIsRasus> "I have a thick... meaty... vagina"
[0:14:53] <CasualAlohaFriday> I always thought this was supposed to be space Yiddish
[0:14:55] <iamyungdannow> Annie murdered that asshole btw
[0:14:56] <+kapcommunist> is that a hat or does he have mushroom head
[0:14:58] <Redblood801> Toydarians are actually super cool and charitable based on the Clone Wars
[0:14:59] <Gruhunchously> He walks the line between Jewish and Italian.
[0:15:00] <+Bluemanzee> Space Euro Jank LUL
[0:15:01] <Chatterbox1991> ruusotalian?

[0:15:06] <dereks0n> This dude belongs in GTA IV
[0:15:07] <+taggerung403> rip dbza
[0:15:14] <+Sargon1stClass> He sounds like my (middle eastern) uncle :D
[0:15:15] <am_omega> If he was human he would be 100% in a track suit and a thick ass hairy chest.
[0:15:24] <am_omega> with a gold chain.
[0:15:30] <Ashenik1> Remember guys being racist towards europeans is OK
[0:15:31] <+PaladinDupre> Space Albania
[0:15:31] <PlainSimpleTailor> Must construct acdditional?
[0:15:32] <BlackOrchidKI> Does he need to be human for that? Kappa
[0:15:32] <iamyungdannow> And a beer belly
[0:15:38] <iamyungdannow> And a comb over
[0:15:39] <theKingRamses> FANN MY COUSIN
[0:15:43] <am_omega> Of course.
[0:15:50] <iamyungdannow> Maybe a fanny pack
[0:15:51] <iamyungdannow> Lol
[0:15:59] <dereks0n> The Wrestlemania sign of a big fat Hutt
[0:16:09] <siamzero94> the correct order is: SZ is 1st, Ala is 2nd, TP is 3rd
[0:16:09] <am_omega> Oh god I can fucking SEE it.
[0:16:20] <iamyungdannow> Me too
[0:16:24] <Heyestus> This can be a bao-dur bit, isn't it?
[0:16:40] <Gruhunchously> Favors are more valuable than credits at this point
[0:16:45] <Heyestus> or is that the bit later on
[0:16:53] <+mankeyfigh> This game is great
[0:16:54] <anar_bael> BIG NUMBER GO FIRST
[0:16:54] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:16:54] <iamyungdannow> And with like one of those flat caps on
[0:16:56] <Gruhunchously> There's also a way to bypass this puzzle entirely
[0:16:59] <Ashenik1> Greek! He 100% Greek!
[0:17:16] <+MrRabbles> so just guess Kappa
[0:17:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> why is he wearing a WWI helmet
[0:17:17] <iamyungdannow> A gold watch
[0:17:17] <Redblood801> Magic must defeat magic
[0:17:22] <+prime_name> Little Ani~
[0:17:23] <BlackOrchidKI> "Hey Niko, let's go bowling!"
[0:17:30] <Tucker0603> JACKIEEEE!
[0:17:30] <+alpharius88> all i heard is fck this quest
[0:17:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ummmmm
[0:17:42] <Jaku2011> This sounds like a quest to not do
[0:17:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:17:47] <Tucker0603> AYY YAAA! One more thing!!!
[0:17:48] <Gruhunchously> Look around a bit, there's a way to bypass this puzzle
[0:17:52] <iamyungdannow> I hate this quest
[0:18:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[0:18:13] <%VCRUZZO> its not that hard at all
[0:18:16] <+kapcommunist> fuk fiteeee
[0:18:17] <+mankeyfigh> Fuck I JUST watched that KOTOR 1 puzzle
[0:18:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> why optimize pylons when you can construct additional pylons
[0:18:23] <Safarihat> its an int check quest iirc
[0:18:23] <iamyungdannow> It’s basically that rings puzzle in KOTOR but it’s over a larger area
[0:18:30] <+Ches_Neckbeard> has Woolie confirmed he's going full Punch Jedi at some point?
[0:18:32] <siamzero94> No. 1 is 1st ship; No. 2 is 3rd ship; No. 3 is 2nd ship
[0:18:34] <iamyungdannow> If I remember correctly
[0:18:44] <Sedrelic> this lp is more like a video guide of the game
[0:18:57] <Ashenik1> @mankeyfigh apperantly people who dont understand math find this puzzle hard and joyless
[0:19:07] <iamyungdannow> @sedrelic I believe that was the intention
[0:19:07] <+mankeyfigh> Bump security
[0:19:13] <iamyungdannow> Our hips are being lead
[0:19:18] <Gruhunchously> It's not about math, just memorization
[0:19:22] <siamzero94> you need to order the ships in regards to which one gets through customs first
[0:19:31] <OkamiDude15> what if you put kyber crystals into some brass knucks? nkoThink
[0:19:35] <Gruhunchously> They didn't have time for new animations
[0:19:42] <Tucker0603> saberstaff is still the coolest to me though
[0:19:43] <MyNameIsRasus> That's lame that it doesn't change animations
[0:19:50] <Jaku2011> Funny Dooku is pretty low tier against troops in Battlefront 2 so that makes sense
[0:19:51] <iamyungdannow> @okamidude15 ...explode maybe?
[0:20:02] <OkamiDude15> worth a shot
[0:20:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> i mean a saberstaff seems objectively the best because you CAN use it like a normal saber
[0:20:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Did some1 say Baller?
[0:20:34] <Gruhunchously> STOP TEMPTING HIM TO THE DARK SIDE
[0:20:35] <iamyungdannow> Is it?
[0:20:36] <Tucker0603> force lightning is SEXY
[0:20:38] <TheVoltStrike> lightning is pretty cool
[0:20:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Gruhunchously there are no bad powers only bad people.
[0:20:46] <OkamiDude15> the dark side is cool though
[0:20:46] <siamzero94> oh we doing this again?
[0:20:47] <iamyungdannow> Bzzt bzzt
[0:20:53] <PlainSimpleTailor> HAHA FORS LITENEEN GO BZZZZZZZ
[0:20:58] <OkamiDude15> through the force woolie's chains are broken
[0:21:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> and like, yeah its less EFFICIENT to use evil powers as a non evil person but if you only electrocute the bad people then who cares
[0:21:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:21:10] <+mankeyfigh> Light points lookin a little low there 👀
[0:21:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @mankeyfigh LIGHT SIDE LATER
[0:21:31] <siamzero94> fuck effecinecy, at some point you have so much force, allignment don't matter anymore
[0:21:45] <Gruhunchously> These saber stances are all real in the canon btw
[0:22:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> it wont matter. Eventually.
[0:22:23] <Gruhunchously> Look at that holy stance
[0:22:32] <BlackOrchidKI> Hero pose
[0:22:33] <MyNameIsRasus> It's Rey lightning
[0:22:36] <astrofalcon1> yep
[0:22:37] <+taggerung403> electric judgement
[0:22:40] <astrofalcon1> never
[0:22:42] <Heyestus> Luke chokes a bitch in ROTJ
[0:22:42] <StaceMcGate> There is no rules that says a dog can't fall to the dark side!
[0:22:43] <+Bluemanzee> Luke Choked a dude in OG Star Wars
[0:22:44] <Redblood801> Yes
[0:22:46] <%Madbearv> Luke did
[0:22:46] <OldManDeckardCain> kyle katarn used lightning and he was a hero
[0:22:47] <SinnerBeta> starkiller
[0:22:47] <+Superspider51> Kyle Katarn
[0:22:48] <Ashenik1> Guys can we just all agree that Ian McDiarmid was the best thing in prequals!
[0:22:50] <+thatotherblackkid> Yoda kind of did once
[0:22:52] <SinnerBeta> plo kun
[0:22:58] <+libra_zero> EMERALD JUSTICE
[0:23:00] <J0RD4NPR1M3> Kyle Katarn
[0:23:00] <%Madbearv> Kyle Katarn did as well
[0:23:03] <tranquilturnips> I think they're talking about Rey
[0:23:03] <Gruhunchously> Two guys, actually
[0:23:03] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Anakin used force choke alot as a good guy
[0:23:04] <PirateMike_> Is that Lin-Manuel Miranda?
[0:23:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> FORCE CHOKE ISNT A "POWER" ITS JUST TELEKINESIS AROUND SOMEONE'S NECK.
[0:23:09] <astrofalcon1> ok but good guys don't really kill
[0:23:11] <ralphfromdk> I mean, if you kill people by laser sword or magic lightning, they are still dead.... It's all about how you use it. You can torture with a lightsaber if you wanted to.
[0:23:11] <OldManDeckardCain> BOOO
[0:23:11] <SinnerBeta> electric judgment!
[0:23:12] <muzaki_lopez> the force worked different in the kyle katarn era
[0:23:14] <Tucker0603> as a lightside sith assassin, I am confirmed good guy lightning dude
[0:23:16] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Happy Electocution
[0:23:17] <gammongaming11> EU isn't real
[0:23:19] <grandark_z317> That means it's okay for him to attempt to murder his nephew.
[0:23:20] <gammongaming11> stop saying kyle katern
[0:23:24] <Sedrelic> is luke ls or neutral...
[0:23:26] <+kaiju7544> Ray used lightning
[0:23:26] <tranquilturnips> @LiquidDinosaur mean spirited telekinesis LUL
[0:23:36] <leonsnixon> aww
[0:23:40] <+kaiju7544> She fake killed Chewie
[0:23:51] <siamzero94> kyle katarn era? you mean the era in which this game was made?
[0:24:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> okay i mean i could use the norma "yank object to me" force TK to pull candy from a baby. is that less evil than force choking hitler?
[0:24:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:24:09] <NaturalGear> at the time RotJ came out that was just generic telekinesys use of the force
[0:24:19] <Gruhunchously> Silver Zephyr...cool Toorna's Pofits...eh Alekandor...what?
[0:24:21] <Ashenik1> Emperor used lightinig and he fights for democracy and agaisnt treacherous Jedi Wooolie!
[0:24:37] <BlackOrchidKI> @Ashenik1 He LOVES it!
[0:24:37] <PirateMike_> @WoolieVersus How'd you get Lin-Manuel Miranda on the show?
[0:24:39] <StonerStan101> @WoolieVersus Woolie, if you were a sithlord you you go full dreads, or small dread?
[0:24:45] <+taggerung403> democracy died with thunderous applause
[0:24:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> GUYS DID YOU KNOW IF YOU BISECT SOMEONE TRANSVERSALLY THAT'S CALLED "SAI-TOK?"
[0:25:07] <Ashenik1> @taggerung403 Fake News from the Jedi!
[0:25:09] <siamzero94> please write it down, if little v doesn't have the solution
[0:25:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> @taggerung403 the Emperor brought americans into the senate room to clap
[0:25:17] <Tucker0603> ray? who dat?
[0:25:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> they clapped when the republic was restored too probably
[0:25:21] <muzaki_lopez> easy way to remember this puzzle, is remember it as "ZAT"
[0:25:33] <Gruhunchously> Wow, that was quick
[0:25:33] <+kapcommunist> SATs are cancelled!

[0:44:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> @illTemperedSeaBass it's a "light later" run (he's being Light Side big picture but does some evil shit like murdering a guy in cold-blood to get a lightsaber part early, or not freeing that slave dancer because she gives you enormous amounts of credits over the course of the game)

[1:54:38] <subjectg> @woolieversus hey guys, just a little mechanical reminder, those stun emitters also come with a really low difficulty class of 10, so even if you do get a stun chance they will probably save it if their fortitude is anywhere above 0

[1:58:15] <+EternalJedi> I remember somebody stopping bullets

[1:58:18] <whirly25> my forcefield is too strong for you DansGame

[1:58:21] <PlainSimpleTailor> Yeah, but you can force push a rocket
[1:58:21] <indig0bird> Against Durge
[1:58:24] <subjectg> and bullets can be stopped like neo in matrix reloaded

[1:58:36] <kadeo8888> Woolie how are you!?
[1:58:42] <%The_Timo> Or a blaster that fires a slug immediately afterwards, can't do both at once!
[1:58:45] <KaitoJinn> KonCha
[1:58:50] <illTemperedSeaBass> @WoolieVersus Specifically the thing with the flamethrower is it takes a lot of effort to displace all the particles with the force. It overwhelms force sensitives through sheer quantity.
[1:58:56] <subjectg> ultimately your best tool against a jedi is surprise, as cliche as it is
[1:59:00] <SoaringLettuce> i think he takes a bunch of blasters shots in the hand stopping them with the force
[1:59:01] <ScreamLord> I remember Mace Windu disassembled a dozen droids and used the shrapnel to destroy hundreds more
[1:59:22] <am_omega> Yo Mace Windu vs that Super Droid army was the best.
