[0:00:19] <Ashenik1> @Vikken141 its officialyy filler ?
[0:00:21] <FlameLoneWolf> 90% of Boruto is filler.
[0:00:24] <%gatorafan> I'd rather not think about Burrito
[0:00:26] <FlameLoneWolf> The anime at least.
[0:00:31] <+shenbapiro> Boruto atleast has neat character moments
[0:00:36] <+shenbapiro> but thats all it has
[0:00:37] <muniea3> it's not in the manga so yeh
[0:01:02] <Ashenik1> Borut would have been soooooo much better if the main charatcter was Sarada ;/
[0:01:05] <OldManDeckardCain> I refuse to believe bolt is cannon because there's no fakin way naruto actually got laid more at least twice
[0:01:16] <FlameLoneWolf> Woolie totally missed Naruto getting his face turned to pulp by that Cloud ninja girl.

[0:03:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> But the Ninja Storm games are better than the manga and the anime

[0:04:31] <$StaceMcGate> Time for Sakura to unleash her beyblade and become Shaman King
[0:04:35] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[0:04:43] <+shenbapiro> guy vs madara was over too fast

[0:04:59] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @0rond Woolie said twitch streams have a smaller audience anyhow
[0:05:03] <strifer413> the storm 4 version of guy vs madara added an amazing touch
[0:05:05] <eddi401> Sauskueeeeeeeeeee
[0:05:14] <$StaceMcGate> But for real, Woolie needs to play a HxH game. Are there any good ones?
[0:05:16] <%gatorafan> Madara did a lot of things, I feel we should try to avoid spoiling Woolie about those things
[0:05:18] <DensityD> I'm hear for a solid dose of Back In
[0:05:20] <0rond> y'all really gotta stop spoilin though
[0:05:20] <danknugglit> I hope woolies not reading chat the spoilers are gonna be strong

[0:11:56] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @densityd Probably early kid Naruto
[0:11:56] <Morning_Asakura> youtube is JUST GREAT
[0:12:09] <$StaceMcGate> The true Death Stranding were the copyright claims along the way
[0:12:13] <%Thorlias> @woolieversus 2 pieces of advice: 1. chakra dash canceling: in the middle of a combo you can chakra dash to reset and continue a combo, extending it for longer and 2. chakra charge orbs: chakra charge when you get a hard knockdown on an opponent since it gets you chakra orbs and only have to charge for less time. sorry for the long message everyone!
[0:12:24] <Morning_Asakura> why is google so trash

[0:13:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Only Woolie would stream and then ignore all the live components Kappa. Looking forward to the LP!
[0:13:32] <rheviel> Awakening happens when holding the chakra charge at full for a few seconds. there an icon at the end of the bar.
[0:13:33] <%Thorlias> @ballerswagbro9k I played this at tournaments and won a few locals. sooo.
[0:13:37] <%gatorafan> I have a feeling Twitch also hates live anime watching
[0:13:42] <DensityD> how kind. how considerate
[0:13:43] <%Thorlias> @ballerswagbro9k thank ya
[0:13:46] <Tampaoster> akasuna no Minh
[0:13:59] <Aristotlay> Minh would never say anything wrong
[0:13:59] <ReNhoSoft1> evening guys
[0:14:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @thorlias Noice I have a cousin who did that on Europe
[0:14:01] <Lavrohas> is the Little V woolieversus theme available to listen to in its entirety anywhere? Just went through Little V's entire channel and didnt see it uploaded
[0:14:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> in
[0:14:07] <beno1133> Anyone got the "Minh is Wrong" counter?
[0:14:12] <%gatorafan> Mihn will be our channel woolieCHAN
[0:14:15] <+goose_attack_almanac> @WoolieVersus There are people with an awakening mode that don't need to have low health. The Hyuga can activate Byakugan in the middle of a combo and I believe reset a combo by flicking it off.
[0:14:20] <0rond> @WoolieVersus for characters with "isntant awakening" flick the right stick in any direction to activate it, it will make you stronger and I believe temporarily lower your max chakra for a little while
[0:14:20] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @itsOnyxLeo There's also donations and twitch subs, my guy
[0:14:25] <Ashenik1> Minh just say "Oh no actaully now I remember.." :P
[0:14:27] <DensityD> the quickest way to get a correct answer on the internet is to post a wrong answer
[0:14:28] <$StaceMcGate> is it Bullshit crazy?
[0:14:28] <%xtremegamer80> Minh using his Minhyakuhan
[0:14:28] <Yaboijsinger> The game's ending is NOT CANON!
[0:14:32] <HeavyC4> i'm here cause woolie is about that giantess waifu stuff
[0:14:32] <+logoth_> neat
[0:14:33] <@Menitta> Yo
[0:14:34] <Aristotlay> Minh has his hair up tonight for +10 honor and correct lore
[0:14:38] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus Oh one thing I saw that you were confused about was awakenings. Some Characters need to charge chakra at low Hp to activate it, others can flick the right stick in and direction to use it and turn it off.
[0:14:39] <FeelTheNiche> I'll just say this, remember to hold left/right, up, neutral and down during a normal c
[0:14:40] <Monkey_D_Judd> Watching the magic happen live!
[0:14:41] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Get a damn Patreon you coward.
[0:14:47] <sakeydo> what got cancelled?
[0:14:57] <Youwereeatenbyalid> The thing we are watching
[0:15:06] <Youwereeatenbyalid> he's cancelling the LP live on stream
[0:15:07] <+itsOnyxLeo> @Sphincter_Spelunker I'm subbed to CSB already, but Woolie doesn't stream often enough to donate
[0:15:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @thorlias Do you prefer to play Storm 3 or 4 online?
[0:15:16] <$StaceMcGate> 15 mins in and the sub/dub debate starts
[0:15:16] <Tampaoster> hi Reggie and Minh and woolz
[0:15:19] <Owkono> go full weeb, I agree
[0:15:22] <askinWW> so rooster teeth couldnt help woolie
[0:15:23] <Solidnick18> both are fine i guess
[0:15:23] <@Menitta> theres no good route for Naruto himself imo
[0:15:24] <beno1133> Weeb it up
[0:15:26] <Morning_Asakura> sub v dub war
[0:15:33] <danknugglit> Naruto is the only bad english va LUL
[0:15:36] <prime_name> Dub bois!
[0:15:38] <%xtremegamer80> Madara's voice is great
[0:15:39] <DensityD> get your good reading glasses on
[0:15:49] <The60012> dub needs more love
[0:15:49] <Morning_Asakura> naruto dub chads rise
[0:15:50] <Ashenik1> @xtremegamer80 yeyeyeye
[0:15:53] <@Menitta> I like Yuri Lowenthal for Sasuke
[0:15:55] <FlameLoneWolf> Liam O'Brein is the shit
[0:15:56] <foreverN2dust> I like Kyle's Mom from southpark being Naruto
[0:15:57] <kiwiredgrave> english madara is Good shit @xtremegamer80
[0:15:59] <Lavrohas> can always swap back and forth each time. mix it up every stream
[0:15:59] <0rond> he cosplayed gaara before
[0:16:01] <blackorchidKI2> I'm just used to Naruto's ENGs VA, since I grew up with them.
[0:16:01] <hassanico2> Isn't Naruto's VA actually pretty low profile compared to everyone else?
[0:16:04] <@akuda_bar> Liam OBrien is my shit
[0:16:08] <%Dman3003> @WoolieVersus Here's two things that are useful. Holding R2 (Block) and moving side to side lets you bypass a lot of moves. Block can also guard against ultimate Jutsu (as seen with Yamato in episode 2 of your LP) . L2 (replacement jutsu) should be saved for when you really need it since they take a while to respawn. If you can force an enemy to use up all their replacement jutsus then you can go full offensive without them being able to stop you.
[0:16:09] <omnishadeee> if parts of ur video is getting muted then its better to just stick to sub. watching cutscenes that get flagged in dub with no sub will be useless
[0:16:12] <%xtremegamer80> @hassanico2 Yes, actually.
[0:16:22] <+paladinstarbuster> thats funny because liam o brian is only gaara to me
[0:16:25] <@Menitta> Oh yeah Liam O Brian is Gaara
[0:16:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I hate dubs honestly its pretty good in this game

[0:49:07] <dundore77> Sasuke at this point in the story has killed a grand total of 0 people
[0:49:12] <%gatorafan> munchmom caught Woolie in a heated seen moment
[0:49:15] <TheSkeletonLords> Doesn’t Naruto become about eugenics eventually?
[0:49:16] <+NiSoKr> That's not true at all????
[0:49:18] <DensityD> sakura lives in a society
[0:49:19] <fairore> @a2zfan shhh

[0:49:29] <zenith0111> Sakura is a thot pretending to be a momma character
[0:49:35] <eddi401> Sakura is doing what she wants at this point
[0:49:36] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @strifer413 I think this is the peak. She's mostly forgotten from what I remember
[0:49:36] <wanocountry> It's because you killed Rin
[0:49:37] <Floridamangentlyweepsact3> its already about eugenics
[0:49:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Imagine evil Sakura LUL
[0:49:39] <Tampaoster> If she breaths she is a thot
[0:49:40] <AThing_> I'm pretty sure naruto was always eugenics
[0:49:42] <medril07> she's the worst
[0:49:44] <+BurkeBigsby> Think of the hair blending!
[0:49:44] <nin10play> @dundore77 Well he killed Orochimaru, but the village should have liked that. And Itachi.
[0:49:47] <+FxyDEV> kishimoto in charge of writing women
[0:49:47] <OldManDeckardCain> but SASUKE was the most AUSTERE SCHOLAR of our LEAF VILLAGE
[0:49:49] <Sedrelic> i only have problems with naruto´ s va; he sounds like a child dinosaur sometimes
[0:49:51] <+hitorio> It's kinda fucked that it's implied that the strongest humans are the ancestors, and they get weaker and weaker with every generation
[0:49:52] <TheSkeletonLords> Okay that’s what I thought

[0:51:47] <+Sento_vidya> Its more specifically Naruto which is the point I suppose

[0:57:03] <a2zfan> Listen to the Japanese. Pronounced the same
[0:57:06] <duneblythe> Sasuke kills like 3 bad guys. No good guys. He is a hero.

[0:58:53] <gordieda20> How has Woolie not seen the killer bee vs sauske fight
[0:58:58] <rad_dude123465> Yeah that 8 swords stance IS THE COOLEST
[0:58:59] <ggbhtg> if anyone ACTUALLY knows how to explain dash cancelling, please do, it's really good
[0:59:06] <+lethallunacyx> yep
[0:59:12] <Arek_1> Oh, no. I'm remembering this fight and there's no way that Storm 3 will do this fight any justice.
[0:59:15] <hassanico2> He only used a couple tails
[0:59:16] <Axle13j> Wheeee!!!
[0:59:16] <+Sento_vidya> Wheeeeeeee

[0:59:31] <Cynical_Canadian> They made the rhymes work but that wheee tho
[0:59:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @arek_1 Its not possible
[0:59:33] <rheviel> man that English
[0:59:38] <wanocountry> Kisame's shark form was badass af
[0:59:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:59:40] <+shenbapiro> Woolie, you should watch the anime version of the fight, it's a lot better
[0:59:42] <hassanico2> This fight was actually good in the anime right?
[0:59:43] <PhantomMaskJr> Wheeeeeee klinkHyper
[0:59:43] <+lethallunacyx> They can all control is apparently except naruto
[0:59:45] <rad_dude123465> yeah the all can go into that red coated state
[0:59:47] <+hitorio> Someone mentioned this fight being underrated. Probably, because I barely remember it
[0:59:47] <BreakersAweigh> Wheeeeeeee
[0:59:49] <rad_dude123465> *they
[0:59:50] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Yeah, Storm 3 butchered this fight.
[0:59:54] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> That's smooth as fuck
[0:59:58] <FlameLoneWolf> @shenbapiro Yup
[1:00:09] <Cynical_Canadian> Should they check the anime version of that fight out?
[1:00:10] <0rond> that form is bascially all your blood and shit is regenerating and being destroyed, and only the chakra cloack is keeping it from making a mess
[1:00:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> bakayaro, konoyaro
[1:00:17] <zenith0111> The fight scenes are the only thing that saved Naruto from being hated by everyone
[1:00:17] <MomsForseti> fool
[1:00:18] <+zombiedinosour> watch this fight in the show
[1:00:22] <%wolfofsound> "these swords are named after my bitches"
[1:00:25] <fairore> @rheviel honestly he doing his best for such weird dialogue

[1:00:40] <Axle13j> THAT MAN monkaS
[1:00:43] <+Merkensteiner> That Man?
[1:00:43] <rheviel> @fairore true
[1:00:44] <muniea3> much more epic in the anime
[1:00:44] <PhantomMaskJr> Mr.T wanna be igaSus
[1:00:44] <mankeymania> dat main
[1:00:46] <+BurkeBigsby> Chakra cancelling is to launch enemy with up attack string, then chakra dash, attack before ending the string, chakra dash, rinse and repeat. Does wicked damage when enemy has no teleports.
[1:00:48] <FlameLoneWolf> Kisame canonically wins this fight @WoolieVersus The Raikage had to save Bee.
[1:00:49] <+NiSoKr> That was nothing like the anime wtf?
[1:00:51] <gordieda20> mine now
[1:00:51] <wanocountry> No shark form reeeee
[1:00:54] <SchlongKongEduardo> YO
[1:00:55] <Leonheart777> Watch this fight in the show

[1:01:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Ok so...Leaf ninja combat vests make sense. WTF are cloud ninja combat vests supposed to be?
[1:01:03] <hassanico2> Wait
[1:01:04] <FlameLoneWolf> This fight was BUTCHERED in the game.
[1:01:04] <%xtremegamer80> DARUI
[1:01:04] <Solidnick18> AY
[1:01:09] <+hitorio> Yeah, in the manga, Kisame was about to get in that ass
[1:01:10] <hassanico2> Shouldn't the Raikage have lost an arm?
[1:01:12] <%wolfofsound> JET?!
[1:01:12] <askinWW> no beheading??
[1:01:14] <BreakersAweigh> oh man this fight got fucked

[1:02:15] <+Tearonex> @WoolieVersus Raikage is named A and his bro is Killer B
[1:02:17] <ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus boy does he
[1:02:21] <%FenixSeraph> Ay Bee Cee

[1:02:30] <+ctommy0720> kisame is cool too bad he always loses to gai
[1:02:31] <+dredgyboi> YES
[1:02:31] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus Kisame has a form, but you don't see it in this game. It might be Kisames Awakening mode
[1:02:31] <irfan_> its something they couldnt adapt anyways
[1:02:31] <+stompingranger> YES
[1:02:31] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Kisame gets decapitated in that fight so thats not quite enough @WoolieVersus
[1:02:32] <4skore> YES
[1:02:32] <strifer413> yes
[1:02:32] <muniea3> hell yeah

[1:02:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hi Liam
[1:02:48] <MasterCosmic> I forget why Kisame is super with Marada?
[1:02:50] <+Chronobot> Kreygasm

[1:02:52] <SlashingIce> Round 2 is later

[1:02:52] <+hitorio> Ninja Grimoire Weiss
[1:02:56] <Cynical_Canadian> Man Garra's voice is great, gotta love Liam O'Brian
[1:02:56] <%xtremegamer80> This is not the right fight, it's round 2
[1:02:57] <Ultimatefool> Why does the text box cover his face?!?!?!
[1:02:58] <+ctommy0720> the voice actor of yasuo
[1:02:59] <%gatorafan> I feel like chat is confusing it with another fight
[1:03:06] <WanderingSwordsman> yes
[1:03:10] <DSD24> Is he blind?
[1:03:11] <FlameLoneWolf> @MasterCosmic Madara was controlling the Mizukage

[1:03:21] <medril07> that's a deep voice my god
[1:03:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Perhaps Sasuke should take off his sunglasses then
[1:03:23] <NerevaRising> The fights are the only reason to watch naruto honestly
[1:03:23] <DensityD> blame the writer
[1:03:25] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:03:25] <rheviel> round 2 is the real cool shit.
[1:03:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> They're confusing it with a,fight later in the game
[1:03:32] <duneblythe> gaara kills more people than sasuske
[1:03:34] <nobody12349> Tell Naruto you were wrong Woolie
[1:03:35] <FlameLoneWolf> @gatorafan We're not, this specific fight was pretty good in the anime.
[1:03:36] <+paladinstarbuster> that never happens
[1:03:36] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Sasuke did NOTHING wrong
[1:03:40] <rheviel> yeah the good fight is later
[1:03:42] <hassanico2> We're not confusing it, there's just some stuff in both fights
[1:03:42] <+ctommy0720> im guessing have an op power makes it easy to become a kag
[1:03:43] <mankeyfigh> They were both right
[1:03:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zenith0111
[1:03:49] <Quietshun13> yeah that doesn't happen

[1:04:01] <jacob2pop> @woolieversus what, are you trying to say you can't just kill the ninja vice president and then get away with it
[1:04:01] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie will be so foolish when Sasuke becomes the greatest hero of all time
[1:04:04] <medril07> congratulations
[1:04:10] <Cynical_Canadian> Well Naruto was right about Gaara at least
[1:04:12] <+BurkeBigsby> Sasuke has bad intentions, but never kills anyone. Garaa killed peeps with bad intentions and is now good. lol show.
[1:04:14] <+hitorio> "You must do what needs doing" = "Bathe in his blood"

[1:05:08] <+HawkGoggles2> I mean, Sasuke's worst action is bring a little rowdy. Lots of attempted murder that hardly goes anywhere.

[1:06:22] <Cynical_Canadian> Hey look, Yamato did something!
[1:06:23] <Sheepeze> oh god
[1:06:23] <Blackscience91> They skipped Naruto's panic attack
[1:06:24] <+ctommy0720> I remember her regular move was throwing kunai traps
[1:06:24] <mankeymania> I never forgot
[1:06:25] <NamelocTheChameleon> I do LUL
[1:06:25] <4skore> that was dope4
[1:06:25] <rheviel> CHA
[1:06:28] <+Darren716> They dont think naruto can get out of a wooden box?
[1:06:29] <danknugglit> "chaaaaaa"
[1:06:29] <+bybyblue> Inner Sakura was a staple, bring it back!
[1:06:29] <Zelretch3000> they still does for Genin Sakura Jebaited
[1:06:29] <%gatorafan> I didn't want to remember :)
[1:06:30] <phatmac16> I remember
[1:06:30] <a2zfan> Inner Sakura was her STANDO
[1:06:31] <+hitorio> Masashi Kishimoto's designing Naruto and Sasuke's fights, looks at Sakura, and just erases her from the panels
[1:06:31] <dero45> But she cut her hair
[1:06:32] <TheUrbanBuddha> Sakura is fucking USELESS
[1:06:33] <duneblythe> Why is woolie okay with the murderer Garaa being good, but Sasuke is irredeeemable? WTF is wrong with Woolie?!?
[1:06:33] <sosuke5> It
[1:06:34] <+Pat_Squared> she just punches shit
[1:06:34] <medril07> gag character
[1:06:39] <FlameLoneWolf> @WoolieVersus So like, Naruto has a literal panic attack here and passes out, but the game skips over it. It's actually kind of sad.
[1:06:39] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:06:40] <sosuke5> It's magic wood
[1:06:43] <DensityD> Sakura = DeadPool
[1:06:43] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kakashi must know that Yamato can't hold Naruto. Kakashi saw him lose to him just a few hours ago
[1:06:44] <phatmac16> Sakura is still useless
[1:06:46] <jacob2pop> she relies on the power of teenage hormones
[1:06:47] <DensityD> DeadPool = Nothing?
[1:06:48] <+Pat_Squared> and doesn't even come up with interesting way to punch shit
[1:06:53] <hassanico2> What the hell does shanaro even mean anyway?
[1:06:55] <+YeezusPieces1> Hey she had log traps too
[1:06:55] <MomsForseti> Its only cool when Iruka does it

[1:07:03] <medril07> how can this stop him
[1:07:03] <zenith0111> Inner Sakura was a weird gimick.
[1:07:03] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus she used it canonically in the ino chunin exam fight tho, BUT NEVER AGAIN
[1:07:07] <+hitorio> Inner Sakura is actually my favorite part of Sakura and it died with the timeskip
[1:07:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Smells like bitch
[1:07:13] <phatmac16> Remember when she was supposed to be good with genjutsu?
[1:07:13] <+BurkeBigsby> remember the Neji fight when naruto burrowed? Me neither.
[1:07:15] <Cynical_Canadian> Kiba "Smells like bitch"
[1:07:15] <muniea3> owo
[1:07:16] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus the game left out naruto's pathetic hyperventilation
[1:07:17] <Lazyallaround> @WoolieVersus Naruto has a panic attack due to the pressure here actually, but they skip it

[1:09:43] <jacob2pop> Rock Yeet
[1:09:44] <NarcissistCactus> sai being relevant
[1:09:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> hahahahAHAHAHA
[1:09:45] <Cynical_Canadian> Sai knows what plot armour is
[1:09:46] <danknugglit> Guy>lee dont @ me
[1:09:48] <wanocountry> Lee is just discount Guy
[1:09:55] <%FenixSeraph> Sai is Eric Sparrow
[1:09:55] <%generalve> it's the same as yamcha
[1:09:55] <medril07> sai's right you idiots
[1:10:01] <hassanico2> But Dhar is cool and Ajna is lame? Kappa
[1:10:08] <%wolfofsound> felt like it randomly happened
[1:10:09] <toyforus235> ?
[1:10:12] <pistachio_the_nut> why sai wearing a midriff in the artic??????
[1:10:13] <+BurkeBigsby> Why didn;t they have it being the original ninja's who went to go retrieve sasuke the ones to pursue him again?
[1:10:13] <DSD24> Sai is Joseph Joestar
[1:10:14] <zenith0111> Naruto is a rare example of story where the world and side characters are way more interesting than the main plot and characters.
[1:10:14] <muniea3> Sai cover up already, jeez
[1:10:18] <Cynical_Canadian> Oh no, Sakura's goona do something, nooo
[1:10:21] <Kristoffers> yep

[1:10:30] <+RiceeFTW> he's always that guy
[1:10:30] <nin10play> Sai became trustworth right before Naruto found Sasuke during Shippuden
[1:10:30] <nevan0> oof
[1:10:31] <%generalve> not real majority of fans love it because of Naruto Uzumaki himself
[1:10:31] <PrimeNeverproc> he is tracy
[1:10:32] <medril07> ENJOY BEING SAKURA
[1:10:32] <strifer413> perfect
[1:10:32] <jacob2pop> I think they legitimately forgot to make the part where he switches sides from danzo to them
[1:10:33] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It happened after the crew invaded Orichimaru's hideout
[1:10:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> We get to be useless yaaaay
[1:10:35] <hassanico2> The new car smell wore off of Sai
[1:10:39] <Kristoffers> saiis like that new shit in Ippo
[1:10:41] <ggbhtg> Minh is basically right, but others are still wary
[1:10:41] <wanocountry> Fuck Kabuto

[1:24:12] <irfan_> do chakra dash cancel
[1:24:12] <+FxyDEV> You cant Ultimate Jutsu awakened opponents either
[1:24:12] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus An easy way to confirm with an Ultimate Jutsu is knock them into the air, but instead of pursuing use your Jutsu so that they land on it since in idle they can dodge or block Ultimate Jutsu.
[1:24:14] <+BurkeBigsby> Easy there you gonna cut somebody with that edge, sasuke.

[1:32:44] <+Darren716> He totally did with the tower
[1:32:45] <phatmac16> Woolie the hypocrite
[1:32:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> He summoned the tower and let demons in....
[1:32:48] <dolphinbj> Vergil is a giant murderer
[1:32:48] <DatAsuna> He destroyed the city, woolie
[1:32:49] <+hitorio> Talk no Jutsu against Sasuke is unsafe on hit
[1:32:50] <+miyoles> trump didn't kill the ukrainens. so he is fine too
[1:32:51] <MomsForseti> Its all about how they react to the Trolley Dilhemma
[1:32:51] <DensityD> how much of the series does that cover? @PhantomMaskJr
[1:32:51] <biomegabear> @PhantomMaskJr does bleach have a play through the story mode game?
[1:32:52] <kingkeldeo31> 1/2 vergil killed people, 1/2 vergil saved people. so it evens out
[1:32:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Vergil never killed people, only his actions did :)
[1:32:52] <NarcissistCactus> atpCarl
[1:32:53] <+BurkeBigsby> super in combo amigo.
[1:32:55] <zepelinnn1> tem ni what cmonBruh
[1:32:56] <NickHatesSnow> Indirect murder is still murder
[1:32:57] <DatAsuna> in 3
[1:32:57] <%Irridium> It was Arkham manipulating him don't worry about it
[1:32:58] <ggbhtg> THE TEME NI GRU DID IT
[1:32:58] <brunoberserk> ARKHAM
[1:32:58] <fishfantasy14> those people are fucking dead
[1:32:59] <+Darren716> WOW Woolie
[1:33:00] <Cynical_Canadian> But he activated the tower
[1:33:00] <transporterthesequel> Arkham
[1:33:01] <TungstenViper> WOOLIE the city is DMC3 is fucking empty, who should Vergil kill?
[1:33:07] <ggbhtg> Arkham/Joker
[1:33:08] <wanocountry> Temen Nigg-
[1:33:08] <+shenbapiro> he can't think up an excuse loooool
[1:33:08] <DatAsuna> You can't complain about man of steel but give vergil a pass
[1:33:10] <framewindowcleaner> Fanboy Woolie attempts to justify the actions of violent genocidal maniac Vergil, more at eleven
[1:33:10] <+primax104> is Minh still not in the frame?
[1:33:11] <bsmusic> He didn't kill Arkham
[1:33:20] <dero45> Vergil was still demon king guy in DMC5
[1:33:26] <BlacSoul> He TRIED tho
[1:33:29] <DensityD> nice fighto
[1:33:30] <PhantomMaskJr> @biomegabear yes
[1:33:36] <Axle13j> Nah they were thugs insulting his glorious nippon steel
[1:33:38] <%TheyCallMeVawn> Vergils a good man who did nothing wrong
[1:33:38] <chancho4tierra> Woolie knock em up and Ult thats a confirm
[1:33:40] <FlameLoneWolf> Vergil is less innocent than Sasuke LUL
[1:33:42] <phatmac16> Virgil is just like Sasuke just admit it Woolie
[1:33:42] <biomegabear> @PhantomMaskJr what is it called I want to play that
[1:33:44] <bsmusic> And Arkham isn't innocent
[1:33:46] <wanocountry> Thanos did nothing wrong
[1:33:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Sasuke killed prison guards letting Jugo out
[1:33:54] <sosuke5> Attempted mass murder is still a BAD thing, Woolie!
[1:33:57] <phatmac16> Woolie is just like Sakura with Virgil
[1:34:02] <Cynical_Canadian> Next he's gonna say Griffith did nothing wrong
[1:34:07] <PhantomMaskJr> @densityd up to the Izen battle
[1:34:07] <+BurkeBigsby> But Karin is Uzumaki, so she has pllot armour.
[1:34:10] <+hitorio> Griffith did-- NANI?!
[1:34:11] <framewindowcleaner> Vergil is almost as bad as Griffith
[1:34:13] <FlameLoneWolf> Woolie has a crush on Vergil
[1:34:14] <+miyoles> Griffith did nothing wrong
[1:34:16] <dolphinbj> Vergil is a dorkier less edgy Sasuke who has done WAY MORE murder
[1:34:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Cynical_Canadian Of course! Femto did all the bad
[1:34:20] <Axle13j> Griffith didn't kill the band of the hawk Kappa
[1:34:21] <phatmac16> “So Griffith did nothing wrong...”
[1:34:22] <Iggeh0> Did Griffith do nothing wrong, Woolie?
[1:34:22] <OuterHades> @framewindowcleaner Lmao, no
[1:34:24] <jacob2pop> From what I remember she is a non combatant

[1:34:32] <pistachio_the_nut> lava girl
[1:34:32] <TungstenViper> guys... vergil tried to kill Arkham just because he didn't need him anymore. that's not an antihero move... LUL
[1:34:33] <+Taglog7> and lava girl
[1:34:33] <teeb15> So is there a reason why they're using the english dub
[1:34:35] <TheUrbanBuddha> Lavagirl
[1:34:38] <DensityD> this hivemind LUL
[1:34:41] <wanocountry> Valentine is a true American Patriot
[1:34:42] <duneblythe> lava girl
[1:34:43] <VidulaSaix> What kind of logic is that Woolie. If he didn't see her kill a baby, as far as he knows hes still killing an innocent LUL
[1:34:43] <gordieda20> Sasuke killed a bunch of Samurai
[1:34:45] <HoldBtoRun> my boys out here with the lava girl reply LUL
[1:34:46] <4skore> one more time
[1:34:50] <ggbhtg> Karin, Jugo, Suigetsu @woolieversus
[1:34:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:34:53] <Cynical_Canadian> Woolie totally is the Sakura to Vergil's Sasuke
[1:34:56] <medril07> naruto has a lava girl
[1:34:58] <DSD24> @BallerSwagBro9k Was it cool
[1:35:01] <framewindowcleaner> @OuterHades True, but Woolie needs to be shown the truth about his White haired crush
[1:35:02] <FlameLoneWolf> Lava girl LUL
[1:35:03] <dero45> Jugo loves murder
[1:35:04] <Arnoldoaad1> so bad guys arent really bad unless they kill babies, i got it
[1:35:06] <+primax104> any chat that knows shark boy and lava girl is a good chat
[1:35:07] <+kinmarik> Jugo murders alot of people tho
[1:35:07] <medril07> that red head hokage
[1:35:13] <+shenbapiro> Vergil did the same thing to Arkham
[1:35:16] <+Sento_vidya> yeah the scene was trying to convey he can only see his goal, revenge. Lives no longer matter
[1:35:18] <OuterHades> @framewindowcleaner ohnBaby
[1:35:21] <+zombiedinosour> jugo doesnt murdur cuz he wants to
[1:35:22] <+Taglog7> Robert Rodriguez Boyz Poooound
[1:35:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @primax104 It's shittier Spy Kids
[1:35:23] <eddi401> I guess they are victims of Orochimaru
[1:35:26] <LilacKing> Yamato is ultimate jobber
[1:35:33] <+Sento_vidya> plus his goal is to wipe out the entire village regardless
[1:35:38] <+FxyDEV> he also made the raikage cut off his arm
[1:35:40] <ggbhtg> by this point, Sasuke has killed armed soldiers, Samurai, and attacked a government official, the Raikage
[1:35:42] <bsmusic> @shenbapiro Arkham isn't innocent, he killed his wife
[1:35:44] <Whately> itachi was dying anyway
[1:35:44] <biomegabear> jail?
[1:35:45] <DensityD> Kenshin is so Bishi
[1:35:47] <TheUrbanBuddha> Danzo was just an asshole
[1:35:48] <+primax104> @Sphincter_Spelunker absolutely, but we all still watched it XD
[1:35:50] <hassanico2> I think the point Woolie's trying to get to is the Moral Event Horizon
[1:35:52] <rubbishbinge> Makoto
[1:36:00] <mankeyfigh> @woolieversus What. About the guy who explodes
[1:36:03] <+miyoles> the writer was the true villian all along
[1:36:04] <VidulaSaix> Shishios the best
[1:36:05] <wanocountry> Shishio did nothing wrong LUL
[1:36:06] <Arnoldoaad1> to be of use for him
[1:36:06] <framewindowcleaner> Orochimaru manipulated Vergil, which is why Sephiroth has to end the Band of the Hawk
[1:36:07] <Ashenik1> Is woolie gonna watch anima edited in the video on YT or is it just gonna be in the first LP?
[1:36:07] <+Sento_vidya> Look at these fake friendship scenes they made up
[1:36:08] <DSD24> @BallerSwagBro9k That's rad, does the Mandalorian speak much or is he pretty quiet?
[1:36:13] <+primax104> man this frame is super early
[1:36:14] <dolphinbj> like Haku
[1:36:15] <ggbhtg> by this point, Sasuke has killed armed soldiers, Samurai, and attacked a government official, the Raikage, who lost an arm in the fight
[1:36:15] <Nameless0100> Wow...this is such an emotionally scene. I'm really feeling- ResidentSleeper
[1:36:30] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus by this point, Sasuke has killed armed soldiers, Samurai, and attacked a government official, the Raikage, who lost an arm in the fight

[1:37:05] <Orbeii> thats a true villain
[1:37:05] <Iggeh0> Karin was kidnapped as a child, she's not evil lol
[1:37:05] <DatHatBoy> What about a guy who isn't much of a good guy, that is on the "good side"? or is this exclusive to the "bad guys"?
[1:37:06] <reiju_22> vegeta vs nappa

[1:37:14] <zeroraider> Shishio is in hell now and he LOVES it
[1:37:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Arkham also killed people just by looking them. He teamed up with Vergil because Vergil was the first to not die.

[1:41:13] <dero45> She’s a fan gurl
[1:41:14] <ggbhtg> it isn't too important that Karin is an Uzumaki
[1:41:14] <NickHatesSnow> He had like 20 conversations with her total
[1:41:16] <TheUrbanBuddha> Cuz he's not paying attention
[1:41:16] <duneblythe> i love minh
[1:41:17] <Orbeii> yeah she was testing him
[1:41:19] <+miyoles> didn't he always hate her?

[1:41:20] <Nekros4442> Yes she was trying to fool him
[1:41:20] <%TheyCallMeVawn> No but she was thinking about it
[1:41:20] <pistachio_the_nut> LUL

[1:41:26] <NamelocTheChameleon> LUL LUUL
[1:41:27] <zeroraider> *kill
[1:41:29] <+Sendaar> This wouldve been a perfect place to just kill her
[1:41:29] <ggbhtg> A FILLER FIGHT REALLY
[1:41:30] <biomegabear> this is a lossing battle
[1:41:33] <VaudevilleVillain93> Loving someone you know literally nothing about
[1:41:35] <Arek_1> Sakura: "If I defeat Sasuke now..." THERE!
[1:41:35] <OuterHades> Woolie Kappa
[1:41:36] <Blackscience91> This fight is non-cannon
[1:41:36] <+Kaiserzelcor> @hitorio yeah this combined with the naruto love confession were not too far apart in the manga and its just ooof
[1:41:37] <ggbhtg> THIS FIGHT DOESN'T HAPPEN
[1:41:37] <+primax104> Woolie wants her to be evil?
[1:41:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> And later Karin instantly forgives Sasuke NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:41:42] <Fluxraw> Sasuke bursts into laughter
[1:41:42] <danknugglit> But kakashi tho?
[1:41:43] <dero45> She doesn’t know what she want
[1:41:44] <Ashenik1> SHE DUMB
[1:41:46] <ggbhtg> BULLSHIT THIS IS GAME FILLER
[1:41:52] <oHakumen> she dumb
[1:41:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:41:55] <biomegabear> You know when you want a toxic boy and you'll inhale the fumes
[1:41:56] <+primax104> @danknugglit don't worry he's on the way
[1:41:56] <DensityD> where's punchmom?
[1:41:56] <hoenhime344> is there a reason minh isnt in frame?
[1:41:59] <Orbeii> she was shocked that sasuke is such an evil dickhead now
[1:42:03] <Cynical_Canadian> @BallerSwagBro9k Sakura does the same thing after she also gets the same treatment
[1:42:06] <$KaizenChaos> Like she might kill Karin to kill sasuke?
[1:42:08] <framewindowcleaner> Naruto has so much filler that the games following canon have filler
[1:42:10] <%generalve> atpCap atpCap atpCap atpCap atpCap
[1:42:11] <Quietshun13> I dunno about that
[1:42:15] <muniea3> like Sakura could take on Sasuke
[1:42:15] <ggbhtg> THIS FIGHT IS SUPER FAKE LIES
[1:42:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @cynical_canadian Oh I know LUL
[1:42:17] <+miyoles> its called bad writing
[1:42:17] <Mr__Jebus> had to get rid of the competition
[1:42:17] <danknugglit> Hes running late LUL
[1:42:21] <+lag2993> man sakura is the worst character ever
[1:42:21] <VaudevilleVillain93> The fact that she even had that thought
[1:42:26] <Morning_Asakura> bad writing
[1:42:27] <VidulaSaix> It's almost like its an emotional situation or somethnig for her Woolie LUL
[1:42:30] <Jaxnos> oh, so woolie is asking "why didn't you just stab that girl super hard?" ah, got it.
[1:42:32] <dero45> She’s being a insensitive wahmen
[1:42:34] <+shenbapiro> I'll take stuff that never happened for 100
[1:42:38] <oHakumen> yeah sure
[1:42:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Love is just chemicals
[1:42:39] <Bulsokadoo> She could kill her and get closer making it easier to kill him for the greater good
[1:42:40] <DensityD> Ninja need to infiltrate and gather information
[1:42:41] <oHakumen> okay
[1:42:41] <dero45> Indecisive
[1:42:41] <+BurkeBigsby> not spamming up combo into dash it suboptimal. Am dissappoint
[1:42:44] <Nekros4442> She has emotions Wools
[1:42:44] <+Sento_vidya> She didnt want to kill his team only Sasuke
[1:42:45] <JetpackMcQuack> She didn't know he had a team, I guess?
[1:42:46] <trickquestionz> Woolie supports killing women confirmed
[1:42:52] <rheviel> over analyzing
[1:42:54] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> She knows she can't actually beat him in a fair fight
[1:42:55] <+OkamiDude15> @VidulaSaix fool that you are to assume woolie would understand the chemicals
[1:42:55] <TsunTsuchinoko> she didn't know Karin was part of the squad
[1:42:56] <Quietshun13> "Why didn't Sakura feel nothing about stabbing the innocent woman"
[1:42:59] <Cynical_Canadian> Paige would've killed Karin no problem
[1:42:59] <EASrake> Sakura isn't Paige.
[1:43:00] <Kalcom> why don't I just kill everyone
[1:43:00] <+MrTAteMyBalls> ffs she's just hesitating because she still doesn't want to have to kill him!
[1:43:01] <Orbeii> more thought than kishimoto put into it
[1:43:01] <sosuke5> She was overcome with chemicals
[1:43:01] <wanocountry> Kishi was probably on crack when writing this Arc
[1:43:04] <+hitorio> @BurkeBigsby If you come seeking optimal play, you come seeking pain.
[1:43:04] <VidulaSaix> @OkamiDude15 Oh never
[1:43:05] <framewindowcleaner> Woolie, pie stealer, women killer, liar of liars !
[1:43:23] <+Taglog7> BibleThump
[1:43:26] <VaudevilleVillain93> She got a good dunk tho
[1:43:31] <%generalve> hentai
[1:43:32] <oHakumen> Lore
[1:43:32] <Ashenik1> Such a pointless fight....
[1:43:32] <medril07> those two weeks of being friends
[1:43:35] <dero45> Wahmen vapers are confusing her
[1:43:35] <biomegabear> is that cannon?
[1:43:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:43:38] <%wolfofsound> that sounded sexual
[1:43:38] <+RJay80> doodNo doodNo
[1:43:38] <+ctommy0720> out of context that sounds wromg
[1:43:41] <trickquestionz> Yeah, she says that a lot
[1:43:41] <+primax104> lets go Kakashi
[1:43:41] <Leonheart777> LUL
[1:43:41] <ManOfReason> "cant we go back to the way we were" *ten seconds later* "EAT THIS"
[1:43:42] <teeb15> surprised she didn't jump on his dick right there
[1:43:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, take that Sasuke, you dork!
[1:43:43] <Youwereeatenbyalid> thats WHAT SHE SAID
[1:43:43] <+Dorf1> hust got here. has woolie used awakening yet?
[1:43:45] <+Deadpool2450> why she gotta say like that tho Kappa
[1:43:47] <Cynical_Canadian> You can use that line in a sfm
[1:43:47] <medril07> that sounded like those adult mangas
[1:43:49] <+kinmarik> you didn't win no jutsu NotLikeThis
[1:43:51] <+hitorio> What if someone asked Sakura WHY she loves Sasuke? What would she even day?
[1:43:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Plot armor engaged
[1:43:52] <FlameLoneWolf> Kreygasm No more! Kreygasm
[1:43:53] <bsmusic> No Awakening yet

[1:43:56] <%wolfofsound> yes
[1:43:58] <BlacSoul> YES
[1:43:59] <rad_dude123465> Sounded like hentai dialogue
[1:43:59] <Leonheart777> That sounded wat tô sexual
[1:44:00] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpCap
[1:44:00] <gordieda20> yes

[1:44:06] <oHakumen> atpCap
[1:44:06] <Orbeii> YEAH..
[1:44:07] <+angel949> the dumbest
[1:44:11] <DSD24> @hitorio He's hot that's the reason
[1:44:11] <gordieda20> it was absolutely dumb
[1:44:11] <ggbhtg> the answer is ALWAYS yes for Sakura
[1:44:11] <medril07> yes
[1:44:11] <phatmac16> Yes
[1:44:12] <+lag2993> she is so dumb its a crime to allow sakura to perform medical procedures
[1:44:14] <dero45> She dumber than she thinks
[1:44:16] <TheUrbanBuddha> She's a soap opera character
[1:44:16] <+BurkeBigsby> She is dumb. She watches Rogan.
[1:44:16] <chancho4tierra> she can get dumber
[1:44:16] <muniea3> LUL take a guess
[1:44:18] <medril07> indeed

[1:44:22] <+Loyks> you're in for a treat
[1:44:23] <eyezehuhh> lol in the actual show there was no fight
[1:44:24] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus No. She said she would join so that Sasuke would drop his guard
[1:44:24] <Breakfast_Megapowers> The answer is Masashi Kishimotos characters and their motivations are all dumb
[1:44:25] <+shenbapiro> Sakura is a medical professional she ain't that dumb
[1:44:26] <%generalve> MAN CHILD
[1:44:27] <framewindowcleaner> Sakura is the worst character in any anime ever
[1:44:29] <$BallerSwagBro9k> NGL Sasuke is a tough MF. He fought the Kages, Danzo, Sakura LUL , and Naruto all on the same day
[1:44:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Jaime, pull that up
[1:44:30] <NickHatesSnow> No they don't Sakura
[1:44:31] <Youwereeatenbyalid> ACTUAL LIES

[1:44:38] <VaudevilleVillain93> Well, maybe not everyone.... or anyone
[1:44:40] <%Irridium> they literally all got together to say they want to kill him
[1:44:40] <xvstheworld> FACKIN BOOLSHET
[1:44:42] <trickquestionz> Paige would handle this whole situation way better
[1:44:44] <Sedrelic> i mean , she is basically a single mother
[1:44:44] <jacob2pop> These people have a CHILD after this
[1:44:45] <temp0_0> christ i hate sasuke

[1:46:11] <ManOfReason> you were my brother anakin!!!
[1:46:12] <Agami23> sasuke sounds like a school shooter right now.
[1:46:13] <framewindowcleaner> Kakashi has Kamui, he's borken
[1:46:14] <ggbhtg> IN CANON, Sakura tried to sneak shank Sasuke or something
[1:46:14] <trickquestionz> He's pre-Clone Wars Anakin even
[1:46:14] <+MrRabbles> Sauske would not just kill the younglings he would have focused them
[1:46:16] <Mr__Jebus> You were like a brother Sasuke!
[1:46:16] <medril07> I think the jedi are wrong
[1:46:19] <BionicPulga> platyKEK

[2:06:51] <kin_jo> you gotta snatch another Uchiha's eyes to keep using it
[2:06:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Somethings I just realized. If Sakura is collapsed, how is she still able to concentrate to sit on the water? And if this was a river they were standing on, wouldn't the current still take them downstream?
[2:06:54] <framewindowcleaner> KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride
[2:06:57] <dero45> He was using it too much pretty much every fight
[2:06:57] <oHakumen> he used them ALL DAY
[2:06:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> are you kidding me
[2:07:00] <EASrake> Yeah that's why you gotta fucking steal your brother's eyes
[2:07:00] <Nameless0100> Why'd they bring her back?
[2:07:01] <RoldanDgr8> He used it a lot vs Raikage and Danzo
[2:07:02] <hassanico2> Nice corpse Kakashi Kappa
[2:07:05] <+kinmarik> nah itachi was just smart and used it sparingly
[2:07:07] <televisedrevolting> Still totally alive.
[2:07:10] <JohnAtDawn> He’s actually used it a bunch
[2:07:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Would you let go my insubordination
[2:07:11] <Solidnick18> that's why you just pluck them out of people eyeholes
[2:07:12] <NarcissistCactus> yeah why's kakashi carrying that corpse
[2:07:13] <BlacSoul> A TON
[2:07:14] <teeb15> shut up jobber
[2:07:15] <Cynical_Canadian> You're cardboard, you don't have feelings
[2:07:16] <rubbishbinge> gonna SMOOSH HIM
[2:07:17] <trickquestionz> "I'll pound Naruto until he experiences the small death!" -Sasuke
[2:07:18] <Blackscience91> Steal your brother's eyes
[2:07:19] <Ultimatefool> Pierced through the heart and SHE'S FINE???
[2:07:19] <mankeymania> luckily we have a whole clan
[2:07:21] <+kinmarik> da corpse
[2:07:24] <+hitorio> @Admiral_PopnFresh Kishimoto at some point forgot the mechanics and just treated the water like a floor
[2:07:25] <Arnoldoaad1> and she goes to jail for 100 episodes
[2:07:25] <Ianrazz> Sasuke: im gonna crush is boy puss
[2:07:26] <KungFooTitan> its so weird hearing troy baker as a side character again LUL
[2:07:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Still counts
[2:07:31] <+NiSoKr> He used it super irresponsibly. You can fuck up your body really easily really fast
[2:07:32] <%Irridium> these sound like very specific system requirements
[2:07:32] <VidulaSaix> Woolie its possible to still love someone you hate LLU
[2:07:33] <theredhairedtrainer> but no shut up tho
[2:07:33] <+ctommy0720> can we talk about how yamato is a hashirama wood baby
[2:07:34] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:07:35] <Them00n> ASSPULL
[2:07:36] <oHakumen> seems legit
[2:07:37] <+kdallas_> yes
[2:07:37] <pistachio_the_nut> LUL TRUE
[2:07:37] <kin_jo> RETCON-GAN
[2:07:38] <EASrake> Yeah sure why the fuck not
[2:07:38] <transporterthesequel> Yes, it is
[2:07:39] <medril07> fuck
[2:07:41] <Arek_1> Feelings are everything with the Uchiha.
[2:07:41] <+lag2993> so if an uchiha is a necrophile then he has unlimited power
[2:07:42] <VaudevilleVillain93> Shaddup
[2:07:43] <dero45> That’s how he awakened them
[2:07:44] <+Tearonex> YOU LOVE IT

[2:07:50] <jase__x> LUL LUL zyzxLmao
[2:07:52] <Leonheart777> He always loved him, its he is brother woolie
[2:07:52] <brunoberserk> 2nd Hokage : UCHIHA ARE STUPID
[2:07:53] <$SodiusChubz> yeah the uchiha ruined naruto
[2:07:54] <+OUTheTeam> iTS THE BEST
[2:07:55] <NiktenKing> spoiling himself
[2:07:57] <RoldanDgr8> You can't change your feelings
[2:07:57] <@Menitta> Is that Dan Green
[2:07:58] <Youwereeatenbyalid> "later"
[2:07:58] <Cynical_Canadian> I like that Kiba calls these idiots out
[2:08:03] <wanocountry> Hip
[2:08:03] <+YeezusPieces1> The whole Uchiha lore gets worse. Way Worse
[2:08:03] <%gatorafan> And then one wonders why the Uchiha are extinct
[2:08:05] <kentrix11> He did awake the sharingan when he got emotional.
[2:08:05] <Ianrazz> Retcon-gan, Chat you are amazing LUL
[2:08:06] <Nameless0100> No
[2:08:06] <N1netbattler> Kiba got a nice leather jacket
[2:08:07] <Kristoffers> it's only naruto man, not hxh
[2:08:07] <AmaranthSparrow> Eternal has to be a sibling, doesn't mean if they love or hate.
[2:08:08] <Nameless0100> NO
[2:08:08] <VaudevilleVillain93> My boy Lee on his fuckin GRING
[2:08:08] <medril07> sasuke's probs gonna murder a few more people
[2:08:09] <+ctommy0720> is the game over
[2:08:09] <rubbishbinge> Gotta transplant a family member's eyes
[2:08:10] <VaudevilleVillain93> D
[2:08:10] <Nameless0100> NO LEE
[2:08:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kiba's right SHUT UP
[2:08:10] <trickquestionz> It's like how DIO shoving the arrow into Jonathan's body gives his descendants ancestral stands even though they were born already
[2:08:10] <falconx9k> Never change, Lee
[2:08:11] <+fizzguy47> You're back in Woolie, this is the price of hype
[2:08:11] <Cynical_Canadian> "Call me pls"
[2:08:11] <jase__x> back to being a background character
[2:08:12] <Nameless0100> FUCK HER

[2:08:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Lee fucks.
[2:08:16] <Agami23> no it has to be genuine.
[2:08:19] <phatmac16> It only goes downhill from here
[2:08:20] <+shenbapiro> Yes Woolie the cartoon about magic ninja's with super powers is silly
[2:08:21] <pistachio_the_nut> 8th gate fucking
[2:08:22] <medril07> a good person
[2:08:23] <bsmusic> It's a blood realitive thing
[2:08:23] <heartbbyy> Look at that character who used to be the best character in the show
[2:08:25] <biomegabear> cant wait for lee to lose more fightst
[2:08:28] <jase__x> Lee is the fucking best
[2:08:29] <VaudevilleVillain93> Lee grinding hardest, go get em champ
[2:08:29] <+FxyDEV> Orbiter Lee

[2:08:32] <cosmictrashcan> Lee is the only good person in the entire series i swear
[2:08:34] <%wolfofsound> sakura doesn't deserve lee's friendship let alone love
[2:08:35] <Ianrazz> Sasuke is not going to fake it tho
[2:08:35] <transporterthesequel> Yes more waterboarding
[2:08:37] <+lag2993> time to jack her brain
[2:08:38] <AmaranthSparrow> And awakening the sharingan is just strong emotion, doesn't actually have to be hate. That's just how the clan did things, forcing siblings to fight to the death, IIRC.
[2:08:38] <Cynical_Canadian> Lee sending Sakura a text at 3am
[2:08:39] <framewindowcleaner> Nobody's gay for Leaf
[2:08:39] <Sedrelic> what reason
[2:08:44] <+miyoles> Lee is the best but treated like crap in naruto
[2:08:45] <%Quigsies> Does sakura have like... jutsu? Like does she do anything other than heal
[2:08:45] <+hitorio> Lee's life is 99% pushups/running and 1% thinking about Sakura
[2:08:45] <heartbbyy> Lee does fucking nothing in Shippuden lol
[2:08:45] <framewindowcleaner> Lee
[2:08:45] <Ultimatefool> HOW IS SHE FINE
[2:08:46] <medril07> gonna interrogate her long and hard

[2:08:50] <+fizzguy47> Time for ninja waterboarding
[2:08:51] <PrimeNeverproc> how many gates does lee open when having sex?
[2:08:51] <Cynical_Canadian> Look at that run
[2:08:52] <+ctommy0720> "just bite her"
[2:08:53] <NarcissistCactus> oh yeah shizune exists

[2:08:59] <tmo200> I forgot but does lee even have any cool moments in the entirety of shippuden?
[2:08:59] <PirateMike_> Is this an RPG?
[2:09:00] <+MrRabbles> trained ninja running like that
[2:09:01] <VaudevilleVillain93> Shizune is a ninja, what the hell was that run?
[2:09:01] <hassanico2> Best secretary
[2:09:01] <zeroraider> uncanny running
[2:09:02] <rubbishbinge> Guy replaces Lee so hard
[2:09:03] <mankeymania> eat her for more power

[2:10:02] <@Menitta> I don't understand this series anymore
[2:10:04] <+NiSoKr> That
[2:10:06] <DensityD> all according to Keikaku
[2:10:06] <Blackscience91> Itachi didn't Know that Madara Knew the truth.
[2:10:11] <N1netbattler> DONE SON
[2:10:12] <Solidnick18> this anime is dumb
[2:10:12] <+Sento_vidya> Itachi planted a trap for Madara so he couldnt tell him the truth but Madara avoided it
[2:10:13] <Nameless0100> LOL
[2:10:14] <phatmac16> Didn’t itachi want to kill madara? I
[2:10:14] <Solidnick18> lol

[2:10:30] <heartbbyy> kishimoto couldve given sakura the gates as well to balance her out and make her stronger if he gave a fuck about his female characters
[2:10:30] <KungFooTitan> Shonen Tech in a nutshell
[2:10:33] <duneblythe> Itachi was a genius
[2:10:33] <Zebroneath> The power of friendship is dumb
[2:10:36] <Ianrazz> The power of "friendship"
[2:10:36] <danknugglit> Remember that time kakashi stuck his fingers up naruto's ass?
[2:10:37] <trickquestionz> That Obi-Wan truth tech
[2:10:38] <biomegabear> @BallerSwagBro9k I hope so

[2:10:49] <Ianrazz> Yes
[2:10:50] <transporterthesequel> Yes Itachi did want to kill Madara, and set up a trap in Sasuke in case they encountered each other, but Madara is BULLSHIT soooo

[2:10:53] <Orbeii> LUL YEAH

[2:10:55] <FlameLoneWolf> Yes actually LUL
[2:10:56] <+angel949> naw, itachi wanted sasuke to stay away from madara. that's why he pit the amaterasu to trigger when sasuke met madara

[2:11:09] <rheviel> @woolieversus Please watch the fights they skipped over later.
[2:11:15] <framewindowcleaner> Yeah, Itachi really didn't think about Danzo

[2:13:06] <%generalve> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:13:07] <NarcissistCactus> fact checking ruins the lp
[2:13:08] <framewindowcleaner> Shisui is the most OP character in the series
[2:13:08] <Sedrelic> i liked that filler
[2:13:09] <+ctommy0720> he took one eye before the massacre
[2:13:09] <+kyh9> Is this a rock lee episode?
[2:13:11] <DensityD> old man, go back to the kiddie table

[2:13:20] <AmaranthSparrow> Most Uchiha didn't awaken sharingan.
[2:13:21] <transporterthesequel> Itachi showed Sasuke the MS was right after he saw Shizui go die.

[2:13:41] <DatHatBoy> He got one eye taken, then itachi got the other eye
[2:13:42] <Ianrazz> Patnoki the Hokage of the Village of Gingers and Redbulls
[2:13:42] <Cynical_Canadian> They're the eyes from the dead Uchiha's
[2:13:43] <+kyh9> Uchihas are proto-alqaeda

[2:13:52] <+ctommy0720> itachi was given shisuis eye by shisui and shisui had one stolen by danzo wayy before the massacre
[2:13:54] <dero45> He used the Hashirama cells to power the eyes up
[2:13:55] <NiktenKing> all Uchiha can do it, but it permanently kills vision
[2:13:55] <DensityD> Tissue Rejection is only real when it's convenient for the plot

[2:14:09] <+deidriel> Izanagi
[2:14:11] <weissguard> The Uchiha were relegated to a specific part of the village, weren't they? Or am I super wrong? LUL
[2:14:13] <Ianrazz> Izanagi is unique
[2:14:17] <PreAlphaTonyC> Any Sharingan eye can be popped for an Izanagi
[2:14:21] <+Sento_vidya> Every Uchiha can sacrafice an eye to avoid death
[2:14:21] <+ctommy0720> @weissguard youre right

[2:14:41] <+EpitaphOfOndri> its an instant revive
[2:14:43] <+ShadowArcangel> Kirin
[2:14:43] <kin_jo> No, its a permanent use
[2:14:43] <dero45> The eyes are done when used
[2:14:43] <+Sento_vidya> That was Kirin
[2:14:43] <Ianrazz> No
[2:14:45] <Arek_1> Izanagi is a generic Sharingan jutsu. You don't need MS for it.
[2:14:46] <rheviel> that's kirin
[2:14:46] <+FxyDEV> electric is Kirin
[2:14:47] <DensityD> who's talking?
[2:14:47] <rosemon5001> no woolie just now
[2:14:47] <biomegabear> chidori dragon?
[2:14:47] <+deidriel> Izanami is the chidori monster
[2:14:48] <brunoberserk> kirin
[2:14:50] <transporterthesequel> No, Izanami rewrites reality in favor of the wielder
[2:14:52] <+ctommy0720> anyone with sharingan can do izanagi
[2:14:53] <%Irridium> god nartuo is so damn stupid
[2:14:53] <GurrenPrime> kirin
[2:14:53] <xvstheworld> Kirin
[2:14:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wait...Sharingans have a shelf life?
[2:14:55] <gordieda20> No Izanagi is I dont die for minute
[2:14:56] <+Santhoshty> izanagi rewrites reality
[2:14:56] <Zelretch3000> read chat LUL
[2:14:57] <KungFooTitan> Izanagi is a genjutsu
[2:14:58] <BlacSoul> KIRIN
[2:14:58] <+kinmarik> @WoolieVersus just wait till 4 were they explain it
[2:14:58] <rad_dude123465> Kirin
[2:14:58] <Ianrazz> Izanagi is King Crinsom
[2:14:59] <NarcissistCactus> out of context naruto
[2:15:00] <UnfilteredComic> Hate the Kirin
[2:15:01] <askinWW> just watch the fight
[2:15:01] <framewindowcleaner> tHTA WAS kIRIN, NEVER TO BE USED AGAON
[2:15:02] <+hitorio> Tenten is Launch... or Mai from Emperor Pilaf's team
[2:15:03] <+NiSoKr> Kirin is nothing to do with the sharingan
[2:15:04] <Sheepeze> Danzo's technique is called izanagi which is like king crimson if I recall
[2:15:06] <+ctommy0720> same thing with izanami
[2:15:06] <+Sento_vidya> Theres a lot
[2:15:07] <DensityD> it deletes time
[2:15:08] <+deidriel> Izanagi rerwites resality
[2:15:09] <Mythundare> Izanagi is king krimson
[2:15:10] <Cynical_Canadian> Get that Kirin armour set
[2:15:10] <+Raidou24> Izanagi reverses time
[2:15:13] <+Santhoshty> izangi rewrites reality but makes you blind
[2:15:14] <rubbishbinge> Izanagi lets him alter reality for 1 minute or something
[2:15:20] <DatHatBoy> It's a redo
[2:15:21] <FlameLoneWolf> @WoolieVersus Izanagi is a new attack, it's a genjutsu that alters reality and makes you unkillable for a short time, but it takes up an eye to use.
[2:15:22] <Ianrazz> Izanagi is literally King Crinsom
[2:15:23] <heartbbyy> does sasuke ever uses Kyren or whatever its called another time?
[2:15:23] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus If Danzo or any uchiha use the reality warp jutsu, the eye CLOSES FOREVER
[2:15:23] <wanocountry> Izanagi is basically Bites the Dust
[2:15:24] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> who cares
[2:15:24] <GurrenPrime> sharingan isn't meant to be used the way danzo does so it has a big cooldown
[2:15:26] <jacob2pop> izanagi rewrites reLlity, but it can only be used once per eye
[2:15:27] <trickquestionz> I can't believe Pat is just attending this meeting
[2:15:28] <NarcissistCactus> yes
[2:15:28] <weissguard> Kirin is just a Jutsu , iirc.
[2:15:28] <+ctommy0720> kirin is chidori by using lightning
[2:15:29] <dero45> Izanagi turns reality into a genjitsu
[2:15:35] <+Raidou24> Izanami rewrites reality
[2:15:36] <+shenbapiro> KIRIN IS NOT A STAND
[2:15:36] <%generalve> SUSANO IS NOT A STAND
[2:15:36] <+OUTheTeam> LUL
[2:15:37] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Honestly, add the Danzo fight to the watch list. There was so much more to it.
[2:15:38] <$KaizenChaos> Giraffe
[2:15:41] <sosuke5> There are litterally no stands
[2:15:42] <NiktenKing> Kirin isnt even a jutsu, it's just raw natural lightning not a jutsu.
[2:15:42] <AmaranthSparrow> @DesnsityD This is explained thoroughly in Naruto Gaiden actually. Danzo's right arm actually belonged to Shin.
[2:15:44] <NarcissistCactus> yu narukami
[2:15:45] <bsmusic> No...
[2:15:46] <+deidriel> Danzo

[2:15:55] <omnishadeee> oh my go
[2:15:55] <DensityD> nothing is a stand, everything is a stand
[2:15:55] <rubbishbinge> Kirin is a lightning rod
[2:15:56] <Deoxislipe> welcome to the true uchiha eyehax
[2:15:56] <+Santhoshty> izanagi is everyone
[2:15:56] <+Sento_vidya> No EVERYONE can use Izanagi
[2:15:58] <+deidriel> Shisui doesnt use izanagi
[2:15:58] <NarcissistCactus> no pat
[2:15:58] <%generalve> @WoolieVersus susano is just magic armor NOT A STAND
[2:16:01] <oHakumen> anyone with a sharingan
[2:16:01] <heartbbyy> susano is literally a stand guys come on
[2:16:02] <+ctommy0720> but it makes one eye go blind
[2:16:02] <+MrMagikarp007> but you lose the eye
[2:16:03] <Ianrazz> Susanno is a stand, Kirin is a jutsu
[2:16:03] <+Santhoshty> but you go blind
[2:16:07] <Cynical_Canadian> Just look it up, you have a computer
[2:16:07] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Izanami is a time loop though
[2:16:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @WoolieVersus Izunagi sacrifices an eye to use. It's an extra life
[2:16:09] <PreAlphaTonyC> THEY'RE LITERALLY STANDS
[2:16:09] <dero45> It’s how Danzo dodged ure ultimate
[2:16:09] <+nobotie> Izanagi is quick save
[2:16:10] <thepiefoot> Waddup chat, just got here. Anything interesting ?
[2:16:10] <+ctommy0720> Bruh
[2:16:11] <TigerClaws12> DEEPEST LORE LUL
[2:16:12] <gordieda20> It gives up an eye for more time on the clock
[2:16:13] <+Sento_vidya> No flame control is something else
[2:16:14] <+ctommy0720> not the same thing buddy
[2:16:15] <TungstenViper> AMATERASU
[2:16:15] <ggbhtg> @woolieversus any Uchiha can use King Crimson one time and loses an eye
[2:16:16] <+NiSoKr> No Enton kagatsuchi is flame control
[2:16:17] <AmaranthSparrow> Kagutsuchi
[2:16:18] <gaymermanny> shesui is the kotoamatsumi
[2:16:19] <framewindowcleaner> Shisui HAS ANOTHER ABILITY, THAT IS EVEN more broken
[2:16:19] <rheviel> amaterasu
[2:16:20] <weissguard> But King Crimson doesn't rewrite reality? LUL
[2:16:21] <Bakefowl> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:16:21] <N1netbattler> Tempered Kirin is a pain to hunt
[2:16:22] <kin_jo> Basically every Uchiha has a built in 2-minutes of Izanagi
[2:16:23] <Arek_1> That's Kagutsuchi.
[2:16:24] <GurrenPrime> Jesus Christ woolie
[2:16:24] <+Raidou24> IzanaGI turns back time, IzanaMI rewrites reality
[2:16:24] <rubbishbinge> Shisui uses Koto-Amatsukami, the superset genjutsu ever
[2:16:26] <+ctommy0720> flame control is a certain type of amaeterasu
[2:16:27] <+hitorio> Am I the only one here that thinks Susano'o made Uchiha fighting WAY less hype?
[2:16:27] <NarcissistCactus> yamata no orochi
[2:16:28] <omnishadeee> woolie u need to watch shit
[2:16:30] <chancho4tierra> the downside its a tecnique that blind you
[2:16:30] <Ianrazz> My Head is hurting
[2:16:30] <KungFooTitan> This isn't Woolies first wrangle with naruto is it?
[2:16:31] <oHakumen> NotLikeThis
[2:16:31] <VaudevilleVillain93> Dont worry about it
[2:16:32] <AmaranthSparrow> Sasuke has Kagutuschi and Amaterasu
[2:16:34] <+EpitaphOfOndri> its alot of bullshit terms, easy to be confused
[2:16:35] <NarcissistCactus> the la li lu le lo
[2:16:37] <theredhairedtrainer> phones hold all the answers you seek Kappa
[2:16:38] <trickquestionz> Imagine if everyone just got colds and died because they had to take a bunch of immune system suppressing drugs to make this bullshit work.
[2:16:40] <AmaranthSparrow> Itachi has Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi
[2:16:41] <duneblythe> weeb word salad
[2:16:41] <ggbhtg> watashi no tachi bon bachi yall
[2:16:42] <+darkdopple> all Uchiha can use izanagi at the cost of their eyes
[2:16:42] <DensityD> Need Bowguns and Bows for Tempered Kirin
[2:16:42] <ECRead> JAPAN NAME NUMBER 5648
[2:16:44] <+shenbapiro> read narutopedia lol
[2:16:44] <rheviel> so many terms
[2:16:45] <+Pat_Squared> the thing that's dumb is that its not really explained why certain uchiha develop completely unique skills that ALSO apparently have names
[2:16:46] <Deoxislipe> that's what we call SHARINGAN OVERLOAD
[2:16:46] <+Sento_vidya> The Uchiha get SO MUCH BULLSHIT and theyre all named after Japanese folklore and its the worst
[2:16:47] <Sheepeze> @WoolieVersus Each Izanagi expends an eye the eyes are his technique ammo
[2:16:49] <hassanico2> I forgot Tsunade had pigtails
[2:16:49] <+ctommy0720> izanagi and izanami are like king crimson and GER
[2:16:52] <Cynical_Canadian> And then Sasuke used Shuten Douji to counter Danzo's Ibaraki
[2:16:52] <+OkamiDude15> @thepiefoot woolie is trying to figure out badly so business as usual nkoLurk
[2:16:52] <+NiSoKr> The Sharingan is complex it's reallly dumb
[2:16:54] <MomsForseti> Woolie really needs to hire a dedicated Lorax
[2:16:55] <Mr__Jebus> and this is why the sharingan is stupid
[2:16:55] <flipperdee> EVERYONE CAN USE IZANAGI
[2:16:55] <sectzodia> it's called anamanguchi
[2:16:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Stop thinking about it! IT DOESN'T Matter!!
[2:16:57] <rheviel> I don't blame you for the confusion
[2:16:57] <TungstenViper> Amaterasu is a type of Mangyeko sharingan, right?
[2:17:02] <DensityD> my ass can use Izanagi
[2:17:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:17:04] <bigk1427> @generalve pretty sure Itachi used a susano like a stand in the last game though

[2:19:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> monkaS

[2:19:52] <DensityD> boaty McBoatface
[2:19:53] <Rezca> but... didn't Naruto beat Yamato's ass?
[2:19:53] <Zelretch3000> remember thzt boat filler episode where the shadow clones rebelled
[2:19:54] <FlameLoneWolf> monkaS
[2:19:56] <AmaranthSparrow> You see a bunch of generic clan members in the background in later arcs with large scale battles also.
[2:19:57] <+MoistHeinous> I remember so much filler in the anime around this arc
[2:19:57] <LilacKing> You eventually meet anathore bug boi
[2:19:58] <oHakumen> yamato is a jobber

[2:20:18] <phatmac16> Yamato sucks
[2:20:19] <Breakfast_Megapowers> This guy will be clutch this time, don't worry
[2:20:20] <thepiefoot> Yamato has cool origins, sadly he is never explored as a character
[2:20:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> you somehow picked the one that is wrong in EVERY generation
[2:20:25] <NiktenKing> Aoba can perform some crazy jutsu tho
[2:20:26] <+hitorio> @Ianrazz Yo. Gentle Fist + Byakugan is a broken matchup against all but the main characters
[2:20:27] <ggbhtg> Welshy Aoba

[2:22:35] <glass_marcus> dont forget kamui
[2:22:35] <+Tearonex> the only stand is Susanoo
[2:22:36] <N1netbattler> STANDS
[2:22:36] <+ctommy0720> these are just jutsus
[2:22:37] <kikosmore> Isn't kirin just an attack?
[2:22:37] <DensityD> carrot pan pies with different slices
[2:22:38] <savetitania> it's just a visual
[2:22:39] <thepiefoot> Sharingan stands = lame
[2:22:39] <Nekros4442> They're just Japanese gods

[2:22:52] <NarcissistCactus> they're all stands
[2:22:53] <VaudevilleVillain93> Even when you get it, it won't matter. It's just cool names
[2:22:54] <NiktenKing> Kirin isn't a jutsu, it's raw lightning that Sasuke channeled using his chakra as a lightning rod
[2:22:55] <Graxe_> In Naruto lore, just names
[2:22:55] <+hitorio> The Kusanagi lawn mower
[2:22:56] <4skore> he just likes the names
[2:23:00] <+paladinstarbuster> so are the sannin
[2:23:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> they're fuckin STANDS
[2:23:00] <FlameLoneWolf> Susano'o is the closest thing to a stand in Naruto, and it's the only one LUL
[2:23:01] <AmaranthSparrow> Only Susano'o is a "stand" in the sense that it's a chakra avatar.
[2:23:02] <+ctommy0720> these arent people
[2:23:04] <gaymermanny> why is he calling jutsu stands?
[2:23:08] <gomennasorry> IZANAGI IS NOT A STAND
[2:23:10] <Agami23> @WoolieVersus woolie, the maker of naruto wanted naurto to be named momotaro. he just liked the names
[2:23:11] <biomegabear> So did Ino just stop caring about sasuke? Because if so then good for her
[2:23:12] <thepiefoot> Ghosts ?
[2:23:13] <Deoxislipe> everything in Naruto has a Japanese folklore name
[2:23:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @gaymermanny you know why
[2:23:15] <weissguard> Shoutouts to the literal worst part of Naruto in hindsight: the Uchiha Clan. Kappa
[2:23:15] <Mythundare> Rasenshuriken is a remote control stand
[2:23:17] <Graxe_> Susano'o looks like a Stand
[2:23:18] <heartbbyy> susano is a stand guys come on stop lying to yourselves
[2:23:19] <PreAlphaTonyC> Theyre all stands
[2:23:22] <+shenbapiro> No you don't

[2:23:24] <Deoxislipe> not only uchiha stuff
[2:23:27] <gaymermanny> the only stand wound be susano
[2:23:28] <+hitorio> @FlameLoneWolf Gaara's sand is kinda close to a stand considering it's powered by his dead mom
[2:23:28] <jacob2pop> Not every super power is a fucking stand
[2:23:28] <Graxe_> But they can all be Stand powers, really
[2:23:29] <kikosmore> Water dragon stand lol
[2:23:30] <Bakefowl> Shadow clones are stands
[2:23:30] <DensityD> Nothing is a stand, except when it is
[2:23:30] <framewindowcleaner> Sharingans are Bullshit
[2:23:31] <Cynical_Canadian> @biomegabear yeah, she gave up on him when he left the village
[2:23:35] <trickquestionz> Ino is smarter than Sakura and absolutely stopped caring
[2:23:37] <+ctommy0720> they arent from itachi
[2:23:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @WoolieVersus Izunagi sacrifices an eye to use. It's an extra life
[2:23:39] <+BurkeBigsby> Susano is like the only stand at the moment.
[2:23:40] <thepiefoot> Purple rib cage LUL
[2:23:44] <FlameLoneWolf> @hitorio Oh yeah, that too
[2:23:45] <+shenbapiro> NOOO
[2:23:45] <DensityD> big maybe
[2:23:47] <+NiSoKr> Izanagi is not mangekyo
[2:23:48] <NarcissistCactus> no :)
[2:23:50] <Them00n> Close enough
[2:23:50] <+ctommy0720> @WoolieVersus you can get susanno by just having a mangekyo sharingan
[2:23:51] <+hitorio> I am down for calling everything a stand
[2:23:52] <%hawk_rush> eh, kind of half right
[2:23:52] <omnishadeee> u don't need mangekyou for izanagi
[2:23:52] <+killogram123> izanagi is itachi exclusive
[2:23:53] <+Sento_vidya> Izanagi doesnt need mangekyo
[2:23:53] <ManOfReason> hard maybe not
[2:23:54] <+Tearonex> 60% correct
[2:23:54] <Solidnick18> who
[2:23:54] <Orbeii> monkaS
[2:23:55] <gordieda20> Izanagi is Give up your eye for more time on the clock
[2:23:55] <ggbhtg> izanagi is King Crimson, close enough @woolieversus
[2:23:56] <pistachio_the_nut> chat :)
[2:23:57] <VaudevilleVillain93> Naw, but close enough for now
[2:23:57] <biomegabear> @Cynical_Canadian I respect her shes more mature than sakura then
[2:23:57] <oHakumen> close
[2:23:59] <NarcissistCactus> chat monkaS
[2:24:00] <masterfire23> in NUNS4 shisui has a susano
[2:24:01] <transporterthesequel> Nah, Izanagi is a forbidden technique.
[2:24:01] <Datwiseguy> talk about chat? sure
[2:24:01] <AmaranthSparrow> Every user gets a unique Mangekyou power in each of their eyes. Sometimes it's both eyes, sometimes it's a different one in each.
[2:24:03] <Solidnick18> monkaS
[2:24:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:24:03] <ECRead> Correct ENOUGH
[2:24:06] <thepiefoot> Ohh right, we are not here
[2:24:09] <+FxyDEV> Tsukuyomi
[2:24:10] <+ctommy0720> thats tsukoyomi @WoolieVersus
[2:24:13] <rheviel> Tsukiyomi
[2:24:13] <+NiSoKr> That's Tsukiyomi
[2:24:14] <Cynical_Canadian> @biomegabear Absolutely
[2:24:14] <Graxe_> That's Tsukuyomi
[2:24:15] <+MrTAteMyBalls> Tsukuyomi
[2:24:16] <strifer413> tsukuyomi
[2:24:17] <+ShadowArcangel> Izanagi is an "oh shit!" button that everyone with a sharingan gets
[2:24:20] <dero45> No purple stand thing is something all Uchihas can do
[2:24:20] <sectzodia> we don't exist☹️
[2:24:20] <TungstenViper> TSUKUYOMI
[2:24:25] <gaymermanny> the misinformation 😤
[2:24:26] <transporterthesequel> The Uchiha literally forgot Izanagi existed until Shisui figured it out again.
[2:24:27] <+Sento_vidya> YES
[2:24:28] <+killogram123> tskiyomi is itachi exclysive sorry
[2:24:28] <%wolfofsound> INFINATE
[2:24:29] <Cynical_Canadian> YES
[2:24:29] <+ctommy0720> bruh
[2:24:29] <Graxe_> Izanagi is "You didn't win"
[2:24:29] <+NiSoKr> Yeah it's nonsense
[2:24:30] <+MrRabbles> it sure can
[2:24:31] <medril07> inner sakura is a stand
[2:24:31] <NarcissistCactus> that's correct
[2:24:31] <VaudevilleVillain93> Yep
[2:24:31] <oHakumen> NotLikeThis
[2:24:32] <FlameLoneWolf> Pretty much
[2:24:32] <strifer413> YES IT CAN
[2:24:32] <Orbeii> YEAH
[2:24:34] <+hitorio> Tsukuyomi is disgustingly broken genjutsu
[2:24:34] <thepiefoot> The sharingan is the lamest
[2:24:34] <AmaranthSparrow> Itachi has Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, Sasuke has Amaterasu and Kagutsuchi.
[2:24:34] <+cvp5127> PLOT EYES
[2:24:35] <+angel949> basically
[2:24:36] <%gatorafan> yeah
[2:24:36] <muniea3> pretty much
[2:24:38] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Make sure to watch the Killer B vs. Kisame fight and Sasuke vs. Danzo/Naruto fights. Storm 3 didn't do them enough justice.
[2:24:39] <jase__x> ITS FUCKING BROKEN
[2:24:40] <ggbhtg> YES
[2:24:40] <+FxyDEV> wait till you see the rinnegan
[2:24:41] <oHakumen> yup
[2:24:42] <%Thorlias> @woolieversus there are 3 things you can use currently with a mangekyo sharingan 1. Amaterasu flame control, 2. Susano'o a armored thing and 3. izinagi a reality shifting move that blinds you.
[2:24:42] <+NiSoKr> There is also Kakashi's blck hole shit
[2:24:42] <+BurkeBigsby> Tsukiyomi is epic games store exclusive.
[2:24:43] <omnishadeee> stand is susanno and every1 can use it long as they have mangekyou and 2 eyes
[2:24:43] <Cynical_Canadian> That's the Sharigan in a nutshell
[2:24:43] <bsmusic> A pair has 2 particular abilities
[2:24:44] <Leonheart777> yes
[2:24:44] <+EpitaphOfOndri> now you get it
[2:24:45] <Solidnick18> plot devices
[2:24:45] <Them00n> LITERALLY YES
[2:24:45] <jacob2pop> Sharingan is just bullshit no jutsu
[2:24:45] <NiktenKing> Tsukuyomi is the second most powerful genjutsu
[2:24:46] <VaudevilleVillain93> They made shit up
[2:24:49] <+EpitaphOfOndri> and wait for the rinnegan
[2:24:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Rinnegan can do more than anything
[2:24:50] <thepiefoot> Sharingan gives you whatever power it needs to get Sasuke to Naruto's level
[2:24:50] <TungstenViper> just wait for RINNEGAN LUL
[2:24:51] <heartbbyy> it gets so much worse
[2:24:53] <Zelretch3000> @WoolieVersus Izanagi basically is a secret sharingan technique so every sharigan user can use it but not everyone knew about it. It basically rewrite reality and it let you cheats death
[2:24:55] <+ctommy0720> I mean each eyes have a standard set of powers but some also have extra abilities
[2:24:55] <DensityD> then why didn't the Uchiha clan use Izanagi to prevent/escape the family slaughter
[2:24:56] <rubbishbinge> Izanagi is "you didn't win" Izanami was "shut up tho"
[2:24:58] <DensityD> the clan purge?
[2:24:58] <muniea3> not even the most powerful eyes BTW
[2:25:00] <PreAlphaTonyC> Indra's arrow is the arrow in Jojo, Sharingan is stands
[2:25:00] <phatmac16> It gets worse...
[2:25:00] <+fizzguy47> It can't beat tuberculosis
[2:25:04] <Deoxislipe> Well, at least it's not the RIN'NEGAN
[2:25:04] <EASrake> That's just any fucking jutsu tho
[2:25:06] <dero45> Sharigan can turn illusion into in reality and vice versa
[2:25:06] <teeb15> SHARINGAN IS THE FORCE\
[2:25:06] <weissguard> That's NOT EVEN the WORST of it. LUL
[2:25:07] <Graxe_> And then you combine the Rinnegan and the Sharingan into the Rinne-Sharingan
[2:25:07] <rheviel> Watch the Danzo fight
[2:25:08] <AmaranthSparrow> Susano'o, Izanagi, and Izanami are universal powers.
[2:25:13] <biomegabear> @Cynical_Canadian when you stop chasing your toxic crush and live your own happy life, was ino. I didnt see that coming at all. Im pleasently surpised
[2:25:14] <%generalve> LUL
[2:25:15] <Graxe_> For big power
[2:25:15] <NarcissistCactus> fuck sakura hard
[2:25:16] <bsmusic> YES
[2:25:16] <+cvp5127> agreed
[2:25:16] <Leonheart777> If you don't have a Sharingan fuck you
[2:25:17] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:25:17] <nobody12349> Kreygasm
[2:25:18] <NarcissistCactus> ok
[2:25:19] <rosemon5001> stop lying you wont do any homework
[2:25:19] <OmniSTylez> LULW
[2:25:20] <Orbeii> nooo BibleThump wtf
[2:25:21] <+ctommy0720> I agree
[2:25:21] <%Thorlias> hoes mad
[2:25:22] <Solidnick18> agreed
[2:25:22] <DensityD> Sakura worst girl
[2:25:25] <ManOfReason> kill sakura
[2:25:26] <xvstheworld> hoes mad
[2:25:26] <+QatalystQ> thats fair
[2:25:26] <KnivesEve> your not wrong
[2:25:26] <jase__x> SHE'S THE WORST
[2:25:27] <nevan0> oh yeah
[2:25:28] <fireking900> man the ninja war was so fucking good i cant wait
[2:25:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I didn't watch Naruto, this is all so dumb.
[2:25:30] <AnthonyJMax> all agreed yes
[2:25:31] <Ianrazz> Fuck off Sakura
[2:25:32] <oHakumen> yup
[2:25:32] <alexandrecau> it was a trick
[2:25:32] <+hitorio> There are abilities so context-sensitive that you can tell Kishimoto just made it up in order to write it into one scene
[2:25:32] <+angel949> I concur
[2:25:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OH NO DOUBT
[2:25:34] <thepiefoot> Huh, that happened
[2:25:34] <animalxer> Sakura a bitch
[2:25:35] <gordieda20> Sakura had to be Saved twice In like 5 minutes
[2:25:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @WoolieVersus THAT WAS A WORK
[2:25:36] <PreAlphaTonyC> I like Sakura but only of things she does later
[2:25:38] <Lamokmok> Sakura sucks.
[2:25:40] <NarcissistCactus> the whole crown
[2:25:41] <+BurkeBigsby> Hahaha, her end moment in the series is just the worst.
[2:25:41] <brambobelurkin> FACTS
[2:25:43] <dero45> But I was pretty hype when she cut her hair
[2:25:44] <gaymermanny> Sakura is the best!!!!
[2:25:45] <BreakersAweigh> Sakura is the worst
[2:25:46] <+ctommy0720> we on the patrol tonight
[2:25:46] <Arek_1> @DensityD Casting Izanagi blinds the eye.
[2:25:47] <+ShadowArcangel> She wasn't being sincere
[2:25:47] <Cynical_Canadian> @biomegabear you'd think that character development would've gone to one of the main characters, but Sakura stays terrible
[2:25:48] <reiju_22> narusaku is nice because hinata deserves better LUL
[2:25:48] <phatmac16> Sasuke won’t fuck her
[2:25:49] <+shenbapiro> She only gets better from here, so theres some good news
[2:25:49] <%gatorafan> Sakura is awful
[2:25:49] <rubbishbinge> Rinne-sharingan can't do Mangekyou stuff, so you gotta swap em every now and then
[2:25:50] <+Sento_vidya> Sakura is a pitifull loser regardless
[2:25:51] <nobody12349> "Fuck Sakura harder than ever before" heh
[2:25:51] <Solidnick18> until it mattered
[2:25:51] <thepiefoot> You know Sakura is bad when Kishimoto himself said so
[2:25:52] <Dumple_Roe> Demon D
[2:25:52] <KungFooTitan> It was a farce tbh..
[2:25:52] <+OkamiDude15> @CanadianAnimatorGuy you are correct but it gets some good hits in though
[2:25:52] <Orbeii> SHE STILL DOESNT
[2:25:53] <jacob2pop> Sakura may be the worst female lead I've ever seen
[2:25:55] <stormhawk9891> Sakura did nothing wrong Kappa
[2:25:57] <brambobelurkin> sakura worst team 7
[2:25:59] <trickquestionz> Hinata has to get Sasuke's seconds
[2:25:59] <TungstenViper> NO?
[2:26:02] <+paladinstarbuster> she didnt love him
[2:26:02] <NiktenKing> She still doesn't
[2:26:02] <mrpandabear437> yea she did?
[2:26:03] <%wolfofsound> ???????
[2:26:04] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @MrTAteMyBalls
[2:26:05] <kikosmore> I only like Sakura aesthetically . That's why I'm angry that she sucks.
[2:26:05] <KungFooTitan> Naruto called her out on her bluff
[2:26:05] <BlacSoul> YES SHE DID
[2:26:05] <%JetpackMcQuack> She was pretty mean
[2:26:06] <jase__x> YES SHE DID
[2:26:09] <alexandrecau> she beat him minh
[2:26:11] <+nobotie> YES SHE DID
[2:26:12] <amavii> She doesn't love him. She was trying to get him away from sasuke
[2:26:13] <Agami23> she basically said "haha no parents" to him ALOT
[2:26:13] <PreAlphaTonyC> SHE WAS LYING TO HIM
[2:26:13] <+angel949> she physically abused him all the time!
[2:26:14] <Cynical_Canadian> @trickquestionz and Sakura gets's Naruto's seconds
[2:26:17] <%generalve> Minh she punched him over the stupidist shit
[2:26:17] <OmniSTylez> LUL
[2:26:17] <%Thorlias> Hinata best girl FIGHT ME CHAT wooliePOYO brownKOBE
[2:26:18] <medril07> dat ho
[2:26:19] <%wolfofsound> she totally shit talked him for the longest
[2:26:20] <ManOfReason> oooooh
[2:26:20] <AmaranthSparrow> She was lying to him to try and get him to stop chasing Sasuke.
[2:26:20] <+hitorio> Sakura also constantly hits Naruto, which is an anime trope that I find cancer
[2:26:21] <Cynical_Canadian> Perfectly Balanced
[2:26:23] <dero45> She also cock blocked him
[2:26:24] <DensityD> woolie has a personal story
[2:26:24] <rheviel> you learn about the techniques more in the actual anime fights. the game does skip a lot.
[2:26:25] <NeoPockeyG> Sakura lied about liking Naruto
[2:26:26] <muniea3> she knows he has always loved her. That shit's fucked.
[2:26:27] <phatmac16> She hit him
[2:26:27] <jase__x> ooooooooooooh
[2:26:28] <Marakami_Sadaneo> Sakura is so useless, she doesn't recognise a significant character
[2:26:28] <MomsForseti> @stormhawk9891 but she did even less right
[2:26:30] <+lag2993> Sakura the truest of cockblocks
[2:26:31] <+Pat_Squared> if Sakura had been able to properly make up her own techniques she could've been cool but she's basically just the same as Tsunade
[2:26:33] <Sokumotanaka> Hinata's already plowing the raikage Kappa
[2:26:36] <+lag2993> Just let them boys be
[2:26:36] <rubbishbinge> Kurotsuchi is best gril
[2:26:38] <+MrTAteMyBalls> @WoolieVersus i think you missed the point of her "confessing" to him, which was just trying to stop him from going after sasuke
[2:26:39] <+fizzguy47> @thorlias why? you're right
[2:26:39] <biomegabear> @Cynical_Canadian I know right.
[2:26:41] <PreAlphaTonyC> Sakura was literally telling Naruto a lie so he would leave Sasuke alone
[2:26:46] <NiktenKing> She was lying the whole time because she felt bad having make him suffer for her sake
[2:26:47] <alexandrecau> 3 missions made them bff
[2:26:51] <DensityD> Woolie, Minh, and Reggie banter makes me smile
[2:26:51] <Ianrazz> Sakura is just a Cuck for Naruto and Sasuke
[2:26:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Sakura settles for Naurto. Naruto is all No way, cigarette. Then Sasuke settles for Sakura
[2:26:56] <gaymermanny> the reason sakura lied to naruto was not because of his glow up
[2:26:58] <KungFooTitan> She was trying to delude herself and Naruto
[2:26:58] <EASrake> Woolie. Sakura was just trying to stop Naruto from going after Sasuke
[2:27:03] <trickquestionz> Woolie tells lies himself but cannot recognize them in others
[2:27:06] <ManOfReason> SIKE YOU THOUGHT
[2:27:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is the best nerd yelling on Twitch
[2:27:18] <kikosmore> She would have went with it. That's the whole point lol
[2:27:21] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[2:27:21] <medril07> what a monster
[2:27:22] <OmniSTylez> double garbage
[2:27:22] <phatmac16> Just kidding
[2:27:25] <ggbhtg> woolie is currently right
[2:27:26] <Ianrazz> Best Weeb yelling
[2:27:27] <KungFooTitan> He called her bluff
[2:27:28] <Cynical_Canadian> In the end, Sakura is ALWAYS garbage
[2:27:29] <oHakumen> atpRtsd
[2:27:31] <%generalve> LYING ASS BITCH
[2:27:31] <jase__x> zyzxLmao zyzxLmao zyzxLmao
[2:27:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ABSOLUTELY Garbage
[2:27:34] <+ctommy0720> weeb talk really be like that
[2:27:35] <chancho4tierra> she wanted to break the promise by offering her V
[2:27:37] <VaudevilleVillain93> It gets worse
[2:27:38] <trickquestionz> BEGONE
[2:27:38] <+ryujinran> Who knew woolie could get so emotional about romance?
[2:27:38] <kikosmore> We would have had a little pink haired and blonde kid
[2:27:39] <oHakumen> atpShh atpShh atpShh atpShh
[2:27:39] <RoldanDgr8> Woolie going full Pat is weird
[2:27:40] <DensityD> Naruto can recognize when.....hoe's mad
[2:27:42] <rheviel> @woolieversus it wasn't a real confession in the slightest, she just didn't want Naruto to run into a battle
[2:27:43] <Ianrazz> B I T C H
[2:27:44] <dero45> She’s just a wahmen cut her some slack
[2:27:44] <glass_marcus> Garbage and Double Garbage: The duality of Man
[2:27:48] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sync test hype!
[2:27:49] <+hitorio> Oh, right. We get zero insight into Sasuke's tastes or actual feelings onto Sakura. Seems like he just Goku'd her. "fuck it. sure."
[2:27:49] <Dumple_Roe> 830 views on "trash can" Haruno
[2:27:49] <phatmac16> BEGONE THIT
[2:27:50] <Blackscience91> I fucking hate naruto
[2:27:54] <Sokumotanaka> @EASrake Yeah but she also tried to stupidly take matters into her own hans knowing she couldn't go through it cause of her feelings
[2:27:55] <weissguard> She's just trying to lie about her feelings so that Naruto would get into it with Sasuke.
[2:27:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yamach1Hypers Hoes Mad
[2:27:56] <Cynical_Canadian> Naruto calling her out instantly saves that moment
[2:27:57] <ggbhtg> Sync OK
[2:27:57] <RyanTheRecluse> It’s just brain chemicals

[2:29:37] <AmaranthSparrow> @hitorio There is a minor gradual build with the "you're annoying" thing. That's Sasuke's way of denying their relationship because she's making him question his resolve.
[2:29:38] <biomegabear> @trickquestionz pretty much
[2:29:40] <RenFuuma> hello all.
[2:29:41] <NiktenKing> Better than Ghost Stories English dub?

[2:29:43] <Arek_1> @WoolieVersus Make sure to watch the Killer B vs. Kisame fight and Sasuke vs. Danzo/Naruto fights. Storm 3 didn't do them enough justice.

[2:29:58] <biomegabear> Is Hunter x hunter just better naruto?
[2:29:58] <fairore> @generalve I have five sisters
[2:30:03] <heartbbyy> @generalve i maintain what i said despite having that knowledge
[2:30:04] <KohryuZX> What about Nichijo?
[2:30:05] <medril07> pat stole your viewers
[2:30:06] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Nichijou WOULD have got to space eventually
[2:30:19] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Dont cut the bosses LUL
[2:30:24] <bsmusic> Wait, wouldn't that only end up with 2 eps per session?
[2:30:24] <N1netbattler> well these be live only with the YouTube troubles?
[2:30:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Nichijou trumps Azumanga in my eyes
[2:30:31] <Cynical_Canadian> Can't watch those on stream?
[2:30:32] <lordsdb> @biomegabear well yes it's hxh that a really high bar
[2:30:35] <Orbeii> the killer bee fights are always the best fights

[2:30:52] <ggbhtg> Tweet my mans, WITHOUT SPOILERS
[2:30:53] <FlameLoneWolf> @biomegabear HxH came out before Naruto, and the Chunin Exams is very similar to the first arc in HxH. But HxH is just better than 99% of Shonen in general, not just Naruto.
[2:30:56] <+cvp5127> @CanadianAnimatorGuy nichijou is just azumanga on crack
[2:30:56] <biomegabear> people ether love killer bee or they had the same reaction woolie had

[2:31:14] <AmaranthSparrow> @hitorio It's not great but if you go back and look at those scenes side by side in the way they're drawn, you can see a clear progression.
[2:31:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm a people :)
[2:31:15] <%gatorafan> Let Minh look for that fight.
[2:31:18] <Sokumotanaka> @medril07 Nan let's not start that, sides he's got more viewers than gaijingoomba and demoliton_D so he's doing well for himself

[2:32:55] <FlameLoneWolf> lol alright
[2:33:01] <%Thorlias> @woolieversus so one other piece of advice, certain ninjutsu can be charged by holding the attack button after you initiate it. try it with naruto next time you can.
[2:33:13] <+hitorio> @Sphincter_Spelunker My primary concern about HxH is about whether or not it will reach Yu Yu Hakusho levels of dopeness
[2:33:16] <ClairvoyantNara> hxh is the best shonen manga ive read
[2:33:18] <danknugglit> We appreciate you :) @woolieversus
[2:33:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HxH is overrated
[2:33:38] <heartbbyy> i think the beggining of hxh is really boring but it gets a lot better as it goes on, unlike naruto that just gets worse and worse
[2:33:39] <FlameLoneWolf> I've yet to read a better Shonen than HxH, and I'm shonen trash.
[2:33:46] <thepiefoot> I really want to read the next two arcs that HxH 2011 didn't animate, but i am afraid to
[2:33:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I HATE that I can't fight the Baz yet

[2:35:38] <FlameLoneWolf> @hitorio Me. I was a huge fan of YYH, and then HxH took the throne from me as my favorite Shonen.
[2:35:42] <sectzodia> I did something similar to that with piccolo

[2:35:56] <lordsdb> The old pirate era

[2:36:42] <bsmusic> @thepiefoot It is definitely interesting, but the release schedule is like getting constantly blue balled
[2:36:52] <AmaranthSparrow> It does not say Will of Fire though. It says Yondaime Hokage...
[2:36:54] <trickquestionz> So Woolie's story about someone trying to Naruto run in boxing club was absolutely about himself, right?
